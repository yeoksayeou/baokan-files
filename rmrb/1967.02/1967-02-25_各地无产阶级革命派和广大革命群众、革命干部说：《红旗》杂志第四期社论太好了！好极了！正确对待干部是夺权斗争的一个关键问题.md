Revolutionary masses and cadres from all over the country have said: The editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine is excellent! It is superb! Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in the struggle to seize power.

A New China News Agency report dated February 24 states: Revolutionary masses and cadres from all over the country have enthusiastically hailed the publication of the editorial "We Must Correctly Handle Cadres" in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine. They unanimously pointed out that this editorial, which shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, is a beacon, a timely rain, and a favorable wind for the revolutionary masses to unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This editorial is too important, too good, and superb!

Revolutionary masses and cadres from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet have, over the past two days, studied and discussed the editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine. They unanimously pointed out that the facts have shown that the editorial's assessment of the cadre team is completely correct. The majority of cadres in our Party and state at all levels are good, supporting Chairman Mao, supporting the Party, and resolutely taking the socialist road, executing the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the leadership positions of the Party and state are only a tiny minority. The class enemies who have infiltrated the cadre team are also a very small number. Precisely because of this, our proletarian dictatorship is solid. Precisely because of this, we can hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve extremely brilliant victories on all fronts of the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Revolutionary masses and cadres from various places pointed out that to successfully complete the task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the great alliance of revolutionary masses, and establish a "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ. They said that to establish a "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, we must currently focus on solving the problem of correctly handling revolutionary cadres.

The broad revolutionary masses in the capital, while studying and discussing the editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine, said that revolutionary leading cadres are a precious asset of our Party. We must, following Chairman Mao's teachings, absorb revolutionary leading cadres to participate in the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, and successfully complete the task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The fighters of the Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Aviation Institute said that in units that currently need to seize power, a truly capable "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ must be established. The establishment of such a "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ must be done according to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's cadre policy, absorbing revolutionary leading cadres to participate. The idea that all power-holders should be generally distrusted is wrong. Not distinguishing between right and wrong, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything is contrary to the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought class viewpoint.

The young Red Guards of the August 18 Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards of Hebei University said that we must humbly learn from the revolutionary leading cadres' experience in class struggle and organizational work ability, and swear to be true successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The broad fighters of the August 13 Red Guards of Tianjin University said that correctly handling cadres is a key issue in the current struggle to seize power. Without solving this key issue, we cannot talk about the "three-in-one combination," and we cannot complete the great task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as assigned by our great leader Chairman Mao.

Not long ago, the broad revolutionary masses of Fujian Province, who had just smashed another new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, expressed their determination to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly handle cadres, firmly defend the correct policy of the "three-in-one combination," seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! The revolutionary young fighters of the August 29 Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Fujian Province said that we must definitely act according to the cadre policy formulated by Chairman Mao; firmly oppose the erroneous idea of not believing in all power-holders and making them "step aside." We must firmly grasp the steering wheel of Mao Zedong Thought. For those who take the capitalist road, we will resolutely overthrow them; for those who support Chairman Mao and stand on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we will support them, stand with them, and fight together. The revolutionary leading cadres at various levels in Fujian Province, with excited hearts, read this editorial over and over again. Many people, while reading, had tears in their eyes, saying, "This is the great call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao! This is the voice of Chairman Mao!" They excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Vice Governor Liu Yongsheng of Fujian Province read this editorial three times in a row. He excitedly expressed to the revolutionary masses that he would definitely hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the current sharp struggle between the two classes and the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, consciously, seriously, and continuously transform his worldview, and resolutely stand with the revolutionary masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In everything and every matter, we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement and the struggle to build socialism, build new achievements and establish new merits.

The fighters of the Wuhan Second Machine Tool Factory said: From the situation in our factory, we feel that Chairman Mao's cadre policy is the only correct policy. Only by fully implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy can we isolate the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road to the greatest extent, unite more than 95% of the cadres, unite more than 95% of the masses, consolidate the power we have seized, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary masses of the Jiangxi Oil and Fat Chemical Factory reviewed the previous stage, where, due to not fully grasping Mao Zedong Thought, they did not correctly distinguish between proletarian power-holders and power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, resulting in some detours. They expressed their determination to turn the spirit of the editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine into action, fully implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and closely unite with revolutionary leading cadres, implement the "three-in-one combination," and achieve a thorough victory in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The Red Guards of the August 23 Combat Team in Kunming, after studying the editorial, unanimously agreed that they must resolutely oppose the fallacies spread by a few people with ulterior motives under the banner of "revolutionary rebellion": "Leading cadres are the chief culprits of suppressing the student movement," "Leading cadres are not revolutionary," "All power-holders are not to be believed and should step aside." The Red Guards of this combat team pointed out that this view of opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything is reactionary. They said that for those who support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, and adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line, we must believe in them, support them, and closely unite with them to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The fighters of the Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province enthusiastically hailed the publication of the editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine. They said that at the time when we are about to establish a "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, the publication of this editorial by "Red Flag" magazine is like a timely rain, very good! We will definitely act accordingly. They said that revolutionary leading cadres are a precious asset of the Party and the people. They are politically more mature, have stronger organizational abilities, richer fighting experience, and the ability to manage the affairs of the proletarian dictatorship. They can and will become the leading force in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Precisely because of this, the class enemies are most afraid of establishing a "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ and are doing their utmost to sabotage the "three-in-one combination." We must heighten our vigilance, expose in a timely manner all the tricks and plots of the class enemies to sabotage the great alliance of revolutionary masses and the "three-in-one combination," hoist the banner of the great alliance of revolutionary masses, and strive to establish the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ in our province as soon as possible.

Revolutionary masses and cadres from various places, while studying the editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine in conjunction with their struggle practice, felt particularly close to it. They said that we must correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sick to save the wounded" and "unity-criticism-unity" towards cadres who have made mistakes, unite more than 95% of the cadres, unite more than 95% of the masses, isolate the enemies of the proletarian dictatorship, defeat the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party, and achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses of Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, after studying the editorial of "Red Flag" magazine, summed up the experience and lessons of the previous stage of struggle in handling cadres, and further realized that in handling cadres who have made mistakes, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and use the dialectical approach to look at them; towards their mistakes, we must adopt an objective attitude and unshakably implement the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sick to save the wounded." We must make cadres who have made mistakes sincerely correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The fighters of the Red Rebel Headquarters of the Red Guards in Changchun said in their study and discussion that for cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they truly correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will welcome them warmly.

Revolutionary young fighters from various places, after studying the editorial in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine, expressed their determination to unite with all revolutionary cadres under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve the great alliance of revolutionary masses, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The revolutionary young fighters of Huazhong Institute of Technology in Wuhan expressed their determination to correctly handle revolutionary cadres with great enthusiasm according to the spirit of the editorial of "Red Flag" magazine, resolutely oppose the anarchist trend of denying everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything, and in the struggle, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and temper themselves into steadfast revolutionary masses. The Red Guards of Zhengzhou Institute of Technology said: This editorial of "Red Flag" magazine is the greatest encouragement, the greatest support, and the greatest education for us revolutionary masses. The revolutionary young fighters expressed their determination to do meticulous investigation and research in the sharp and complex class struggle, identify who are our enemies and who are our friends, firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and unite with all revolutionary cadres, fight together, and achieve victory together, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many revolutionary young fighters from colleges and universities in Changsha studied the editorial of "Red Flag" magazine with great excitement. They said that this editorial is the voice of Chairman Mao. We must seriously and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, do a good job of the "three-in-one combination," and successfully complete the task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Many cadres from various places, after studying the editorial of "Red Flag" magazine, expressed their determination to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon in the current sharp struggle between the two classes and the two lines, consciously, seriously, and continuously transform their worldview, break down the "self" and establish the "public," stand the test of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the struggle to build socialism. Some revolutionary cadres of Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Mill, who had recently joined the workers' revolutionary faction with revolutionary actions, were very excited after hearing the editorial of "Red Flag" magazine on the radio. They said: This editorial fully embodies the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's cadre policy. We must not disappoint the deep expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao for us. In the new stage of the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must seriously transform our thoughts, seize the "self" in our minds, and closely unite with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to rebel against the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, and build new merits in the current revolutionary struggle.

According to a New China News Agency report dated February 24, the editorial "We Must Correctly Handle Cadres" in the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine, which shines with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is like a beacon, illuminating the victorious path for the revolutionary masses to unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The broad fighters of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically hailed the publication of the editorial, shouting "Long live the victorious revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years for Chairman Mao!" They most firmly expressed that the People's Liberation Army is the army personally created by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship, and the guarantee of victory for the revolutionary masses to unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. All fighters of the army must unconditionally implement the cadre policy embodied in this editorial by Chairman Mao, firmly defend and implement the correct policy of the "three-in-one combination," and in the struggle of the revolutionary masses to unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fully exert the power of the proletarian dictatorship, and successfully complete the glorious historical mission entrusted by the Party and the people to the People's Liberation Army.

In the past two days, the entire army has been seriously studying and discussing this editorial of "Red Flag" magazine, discussing the greatness, correctness, and brilliance of Chairman Mao's cadre policy. In Shanghai, Shanxi, Qingdao, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and other provinces and cities that have already achieved victory in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the local garrison fighters said that this editorial is a timely rain, a steering wheel, and a beacon for the current struggle to seize power through the "three-in-one combination," pointing out and solving a major and key issue in the current struggle to seize power through the alliance. Chairman Mao taught us: "The Communist Party of China is a party leading a great revolutionary struggle in a nation of tens of millions of people. Without a large number of cadres who are both talented and virtuous, it cannot complete its historical mission." Past revolutionary historical experience has proven that this is a great truth. In the new stage of the socialist revolution, we must also have a large number of revolutionary leading cadres who are both talented and virtuous, become the core leadership of the great alliance of revolutionary masses. Only in this way can we successfully complete the new battle tasks in front of us. The fighters of a certain company of the Shenyang Military Region and the cadets of a certain aviation school of the Air Force said that this editorial is a new marching order issued by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. It points out the broad road of the combination of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses.

The fighters of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army, who participated in the struggle of the revolutionary masses of the Taoyuan First Thermal Power Plant to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, studied this editorial together with the revolutionary masses of the factory. The fighters said that after entering the factory, we repeatedly studied the cadre issue in the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must be good at identifying cadres. We must not only look at a cadre's one-time or one-event, but also look at a cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we conducted a comprehensive class analysis of all cadres in the factory, quickly united with revolutionary leading cadres, established a revolutionary rebel committee of the "three-in-one combination," and many revolutionary leading cadres quickly stood on the side of the revolutionary masses, successfully realized the "three-in-one, united seizure of power," and implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," raising production to the highest level in the more than ten years since the factory was built. Not long ago, the fighters of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army on the front line of Fujian, who had made new contributions to defending the correct policy of the "three-in-one combination," said that at the critical moment of the revolutionary masses' united seizure of power, Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings came, bringing us an extremely powerful weapon. This is a great joy. This will enable the broad revolutionary masses to better use the class analysis perspective to correctly identify and handle cadres, achieve the "three-in-one combination"; it will also enable the broad revolutionary cadres to stand more firmly on the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad fighters said in their discussions that our great leader Chairman Mao instructed the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses. Ten thousand supports, ten thousand times ten thousand supports, arming the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support. Currently, supporting the revolutionary masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the most important thing is to quickly learn Chairman Mao's cadre policy together with them. Many units sent large propaganda teams and propaganda vehicles to factories, rural areas, and schools, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, propagated and studied the editorial.

    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众、革命干部说：《红旗》杂志第四期社论太好了！好极了！
    正确对待干部是夺权斗争的一个关键问题
    解放军指战员表示要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策
    新华社二十四日讯　全国各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众、革命干部，在热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志第四期社论《必须正确地对待干部》的发表时一致指出，这篇闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的社论，是无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权取得彻底胜利的指路灯，及时雨，送帆风。这篇社论太重要了，太好了，好极了！
    北京、天津、河北、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、新疆、安徽、浙江、福建、江西、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、四川、云南、西藏等地区的无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众和革命干部，两天来学习、讨论了《红旗》杂志第四期社论，他们一致指出，事实表明，《红旗》社论对干部队伍的基本估计，完全正确。我们党和国家的各级干部，大多数是好的，是拥护毛主席，拥护党，坚决走社会主义道路的，是执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的。钻到党和国家领导岗位的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，仅仅是一小撮。钻进干部队伍中的阶级异己分子，只是极少数。正因为这样，所以我们的无产阶级专政的政权是巩固的。正因为这样，所以在我们的国家里，才能高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设各条战线上的极其辉煌的胜利。
    各地的无产阶级革命派、革命干部和广大革命群众指出，要胜利地完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务，必须遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决实行无产阶级革命派大联合，建立“三结合”的临时权力机构。他们说，要建立“三结合”的临时权力机构，在当前必须着重解决正确对待革命干部的问题。
    首都广大无产阶级革命派在学习、座谈《红旗》杂志第四期社论时说，革命的领导干部是我们党的宝贵财富，我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，吸收革命的领导干部参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，胜利地完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务。北京航空学院红旗战斗队的战士们说，在当前需要夺权的单位，必须要成立一个真正有领导能力的“三结合”的临时权力机构，而这样的“三结合”的临时权力机构的建立，必须按照毛泽东思想办事，按照毛主席的干部政策办事，吸收革命的领导干部参加。那种认为只要是当权派，就一概不相信，这是不对的。不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的。
    河北大学毛泽东思想八一八红卫兵小将们说，我们要虚心地学习革命领导干部的阶级斗争经验和组织工作能力，誓作真正的无产阶级革命事业接班人。天津大学八一三红卫兵的广大战士说，正确地对待干部是当前夺权斗争的关键问题，不解决这一关键问题，就谈不到“三结合”，就不能完成我们伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务。
    不久前粉碎了资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑的福建省广大无产阶级革命派表示，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，正确地对待干部，坚决保卫“三结合”的正确方针，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！福建省“八·二九”革命造反总司令部的革命小将们说，我们一定遵照毛主席制定的党的干部政策办事；坚决反对不分青红皂白、凡是当权派都不相信、都要他们“靠边站”的错误思想。我们要牢牢地把握住毛泽东思想这个方向盘。凡是走资本主义道路的当权派，就坚决打倒；凡是拥护毛主席、站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边的好干部，我们就要拥护他们，支持他们，和他们站在一起，共同战斗。福建省各级革命领导干部，用激动的心情，一次又一次地阅读了这篇社论。许多人一边读，一面热泪盈眶地说，这是伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召！是毛主席的声音！他们激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”福建省副省长刘永生同志，把这篇社论接连读了三遍，他激动地向无产阶级革命派表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在当前两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争中，以毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地、认真地、不断地改造自己的世界观，坚决同革命群众站在一起，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。事事、处处都要按照毛主席的指示办事，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中和建设社会主义的斗争中，建新功，立新劳。
    武汉第二机床厂无产阶级革命派的战士们说：从我们厂里情况看，我们体会到，毛主席提出的干部政策，是唯一正确的政策。只有全面地执行毛主席的干部政策，才能最大限度地孤立走资本主义道路的当权派，才能团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，才能巩固已夺取的权，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    江西油脂化工厂无产阶级革命派职工回顾前一阶段，由于没有很好地掌握毛泽东思想，对领导干部没有很好地区分是无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路的当权派，以致走了一些弯路。他们表示，一定要把《红旗》杂志第四期社论的精神化为自己的行动，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，和革命的领导干部紧密地团结在一起，实行“三结合”，取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的彻底胜利。
    昆明八·二三战斗兵团的红卫兵战士学习社论后，一致认为，要坚决反对少数别有用心的家伙打着“革命造反”的旗号散布的谬论：“领导干部都是镇压学生运动的罪魁祸首”，“领导干部都是不革命的”，“凡是当权派，概不可信，都靠边站”。这个兵团的红卫兵战士指出，这种不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的论调是反动的。他们说，对于那些拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，坚持无产阶级革命路线的干部，我们要相信他们，支持他们，同他们紧密结合，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。
    红色造反者吉林省革命委员会的全体战士们，纵情欢呼《红旗》杂志第四期社论的发表。他们说，正当我们要建立“三结合”的临时权力机构的时候，《红旗》杂志发表了这篇社论，真是一场及时雨，好得很！我们坚决照办。他们说，革命的领导干部，是党和人民的宝贵财富。他们政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，斗争经验比较丰富，具有为无产阶级掌权和管理业务的能力，他们可以而且能够成为向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的领导力量。正因为这样，阶级敌人才最害怕建立“三结合”的临时权力机构，竭力破坏“三结合”，我们一定要提高警惕，及时戳穿阶级敌人破坏大联合和“三结合”的一切阴谋诡计，高举无产阶级革命派大联合的旗帜，努力促进我省“三结合”的临时权力机构早日建立起来。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命干部，结合斗争实践学习了《红旗》杂志第四期社论，感到特别亲切。他们说，我们一定要正确地贯彻毛主席的干部政策，对犯错误的干部实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，把无产阶级的敌人彻底孤立起来，战胜资产阶级及其在党内的代理人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。杭州机床厂革命派职工学习了《红旗》杂志社论，总结了前一阶段斗争中对待干部的经验教训，更进一步认识到，对待犯错误的干部，一定要遵照毛主席的指示，用一分为二的观点去看他们；对他们的错误，应该采取实事求是的态度，毫不动摇地实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策。要使犯了错误的干部心悦诚服，认真改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。红色造反者长春市红卫兵总部的战士们在学习讨论中说，对于犯错误的干部，只要他们真正改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，我们就热烈欢迎。
    各地革命小将学习了《红旗》杂志第四期社论后，表示要在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，同一切革命干部团结起来，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，把文化大革命进行到底。武汉华中工学院的革命小将们表示，一定要按照《红旗》杂志社论的精神，满腔热情地正确地对待革命干部，坚决反对否定一切、排斥一切、打倒一切的无政府主义思潮，在斗争中加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，把自己锻炼成为坚定的无产阶级革命派。郑州工学院的红卫兵小将们说：《红旗》杂志这篇社论，是毛主席和党中央对我们无产阶级革命派最大的鼓舞，最大的支持，最大的教育。革命小将们表示，一定要在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，做艰苦细致的调查研究，认清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，坚定不移地执行毛主席的干部政策，和一切革命干部紧紧团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。长沙市高等院校的许多革命小将怀着极其兴奋的心情学习了《红旗》杂志社论。他们说，这篇社论是毛主席的声音。我们一定要认真地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，搞好“三结合”，胜利地完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务。
    许多地方的干部学习了《红旗》杂志社论后表示，在当前两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争中，一定要用毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地、认真地、不断地改造自己的世界观，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，经受无产阶级文化大革命的考验，在无产阶级文化大革命中建立新的功劳。郑州国棉一厂的一些革命干部在不久前刚以革命的实际行动，争取加入了工人革命派组织。他们在广播中听了《红旗》杂志社论后，十分激动地说：这篇社论充分体现了毛主席的干部政策的英明伟大。我们一定不辜负党和毛主席对我们的深切期望，在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的新阶段中，认真改造思想，夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，紧紧和无产阶级革命派工人一起，造走资本主义道路当权派的反，在当前的革命斗争中立新功。
    据新华社二十四日讯　闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的《红旗》杂志第四期社论《必须正确地对待干部》，象一盏光芒四射的明灯，照亮了无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的胜利道路。人民解放军广大指战员最热烈地欢呼社论的发表，千遍万遍高呼：“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们最坚定地表示：人民解放军是最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的胜利保证。全军指战员一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行这篇社论体现的毛主席的干部政策，坚决保卫和执行“三结合”的正确方针，在无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，充分发挥无产阶级专政的威力，胜利完成党和人民赋予人民解放军的光荣的历史使命。
    这两天，全军上下都在认真学习和讨论《红旗》杂志的这篇社论，畅谈毛主席的干部政策的英明、正确、伟大。在已经取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权胜利的上海、山西、青岛、贵州、黑龙江等省、市，当地驻军广大指战员说，这篇社论是当前搞好“三结合”联合夺权斗争的及时雨、方向盘、指路灯，给无产阶级革命派指出并解决了当前联合夺权中一个重大的、关键的问题。毛主席教导我们说：“中国共产党是在一个几万万人的大民族中领导伟大革命斗争的党，没有多数才德兼备的领导干部，是不能完成其历史任务的。”过去的革命历史经验证明了这是一个伟大的真理，在社会主义革命的新阶段，也必须有大批才德兼备的革命领导干部，成为无产阶级革命派大联合的核心领导，只有这样，才能胜利完成摆在我们面前的新的战斗任务。沈阳部队某部五连的指战员和空军某航校的学员们说，这篇社论是毛主席和党中央发出的新的进军号令。它指出了广大革命干部和广大革命群众相结合的康庄大道。
    参加太原第一热电厂无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的某部六连指战员和这个厂的革命群众一起学习了这篇社论。指战员们说，我们进厂后和革命造反派一起反复学习了“十六条”中的干部问题和毛主席的教导：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”遵照毛主席的教导对全厂干部全面进行了阶级分析，很快和革命的领导干部团结起来，成立了“三结合”的革命造反委员会，不少革命的领导干部迅速站到了无产阶级革命派一边，胜利实现了“三位一体，联合夺权”，并且贯彻执行了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把生产提高到建厂十多年来的最高水平。不久前为捍卫“三结合”正确方针立下新功的福建前线某部六连指战员们说，正当无产阶级革命派联合夺权的关键时刻，传来了毛主席的亲切教导，给我们送来了威力无比强大的武器，这是一件大喜事。这将使广大革命群众更好地运用阶级分析的观点，正确地识别干部、对待干部，实现“三结合”；也将使广大革命干部更加坚定地站到以毛主席为代表的革命路线上来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    广大指战员在座谈中说，我们伟大领袖毛主席指示人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。千支持，万支持，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派是最大的支持。当前，支持无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，最要紧的就是和他们一起真正把毛主席的干部政策迅速学到手。许多部队派出大批宣传队、宣传车，深入工厂、农村、学校，和广大革命群众一起宣传和学习社论。
