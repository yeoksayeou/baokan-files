The bigwigs in the Kremlin are trembling...

The Soviet revisionist authorities, terrified and restless due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, view several hundred Chinese students passing through Moscow on their way home as a monstrous calamity, living in constant fear. Since January 25th, the Soviet revisionist authorities have been extremely nervous and terrified. Let's take a look at their disgraceful behavior!

Police and spies are cowardly

First, let's look at Red Square. After the Soviet revisionist authorities' bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe on January 25th, the atmosphere on Red Square suddenly became very tense. The Soviet revisionist authorities immediately erected a two-meter-high wooden wall using thick wooden planks, tightly surrounding Lenin's Mausoleum. Outside the wooden wall, police are on guard. The police on Red Square are not only more numerous than usual but also particularly "alert." As soon as they see Chinese people visiting, they immediately contact each other, and plainclothes spies closely monitor them.

On February 1st, when a reporter was taking photos on Red Square, he was unreasonably interfered with: "Why are you taking a photo of this?" "Go take photos elsewhere!" The reporter wanted to take a photo of a few children playing on Red Square, and the plainclothes spies came out to obstruct: "Why do you want to take a photo of the children? If you want to take a photo of children, go to the summer camp!" He even had the nerve to say that, but in the cold winter of Moscow, he probably couldn't even find a summer camp himself!

Open and hidden guards "protect" the Chinese embassy

Now, let's look at the atmosphere around the Chinese embassy. *Izvestia* and TASS call the Chinese students passing through Moscow on their way home "Red Guards." In fact, none of these Chinese students are wearing Red Guard armbands. They all live in the Chinese embassy, studying the works of Chairman Mao, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing revolutionary songs. But their voices are like thunder, terrifying the old men of Moscow.

The Chinese embassy is surrounded by open and hidden guards, with large numbers of police cars patrolling day and night. Woohoo, woohoo, police cars and motorcycles loaded with police and plainclothes spies, police cars with loudspeakers, and other vehicles are constantly busy around the embassy.

Police cars "escort" and "welcome" with a guard of honor

The train stations and airports where Chinese students pass through have become heavily guarded places for Soviet police. They gather in groups of three or five around the Chinese students. The entrances of the stations are filled with all kinds of police cars.

On the night of January 29th, some Chinese students who were persecuted in Paris by the Soviet revisionists in collusion with the French authorities landed in Moscow by plane. Plainclothes spies at the airport almost formed a "guard of honor" for them. When the Chinese students drove into the city, police cars escorted them in front and behind. All the way, the green lights were on. The Soviet revisionist authorities' fear of Chinese students had reached an unprecedented level. They even unreasonably insisted that the cars carrying Chinese students not pass through the city's busy areas.

One evening, when Chinese students from Poland arrived in Moscow, they also received "special treatment" at the Belorussian Station. Police cars, motorcycles, and small cars with walkie-talkies escorted the Chinese students' car all the way to the Chinese embassy. The Chinese students sang Chairman Mao's quotations all the way, terrifying the Soviet police.

Airport on high alert

On February 1st, the event of the Chinese chartered plane leaving Moscow to pick up students caused the Soviet revisionist authorities to panic.

As soon as the cars carrying Chinese students and their escorts drove out of the Chinese embassy, the large number of Soviet police cars, motorcycles, police cars with loudspeakers, and small trucks that had been waiting around the Chinese embassy followed closely, never leaving their side, as if escorting some visiting foreign dignitary. When the Chinese students arrived at the airport, the security was extremely tight, with a guard every three steps and a sentry every five steps. The number of border guards increased, and a Soviet colonel personally directed the scene. Police and plainclothes spies were also deployed in layers.

With these disgraceful behaviors, the Soviet bigwigs appear to be bold on the surface but are cowardly at heart. This fully shows that they are nothing but paper tigers. Their disgraceful deeds once again prove the correct judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

    克里姆林宫的老爷们在发抖……
    被中国无产阶级文化大革命吓得丧魂落魄、坐立不安的苏修当局，对于几百名途经莫斯科回国的中国留学生，视为洪水猛兽，惶惶不可终日。自从一月二十五日以来，苏修当局一直是神经紧张，惊恐万状。让我们来看看他们的丑态吧！
      警察特务胆小如鼠
    先来看看红场。在一月二十五日发生了苏修当局血腥镇压中国留欧学生的事件以后，红场的气氛突然变得十分紧张。苏修当局立即用厚厚的木板，竖起了一道两米多高的木墙，把列宁陵墓紧紧地围了起来，木墙外面还有警察放哨。红场上的警察，不但比平时多，而且特别“机警”。一看到有中国人参观时，他们就立刻互相联系，便衣特务严密监视。
    二月一日，当记者在红场拍照时，受到了无理干涉：“你为什么照这个？”“到别处去照吧！”记者想照一下在红场上玩耍的几个孩子，便衣特务又出来阻挡：“你干嘛要照小孩？要照小孩就到夏令营去照吧！”亏他说得出口，在这严寒隆冬的莫斯科，恐怕他自己也找不到夏令营吧！
        明岗暗哨“保护”中国使馆
    让我们再来看看中国大使馆周围的气氛。《消息报》和塔斯社把路经莫斯科回国的中国学生叫做红卫兵。其实，这些中国留学生中谁也没有带红卫兵袖章。他们全都住在中国大使馆里，只是在大使馆里面学习毛主席著作，朗读毛主席语录，唱革命歌曲。但他们的声音却似惊雷一般，吓坏了莫斯科的老爷们。
    中国大使馆周围明岗暗哨密布，大批警车往返巡逻。呜呜呜，呜呜呜，满载警察和便衣特务的警车，装有扩音喇叭的警车和摩托车等，日夜不停地在使馆周围奔忙。
        警车“护送”“夹道欢迎”
    中国留学生往来经过的火车站、飞机场成了苏联警察戒备森严的场所。他们三五成群围着中国学生转来转去。车站门口的各式各样的警车密密麻麻。
    一月二十九日夜间，在巴黎受到苏修同法国当局串通迫害的部分中国留学生乘飞机在莫斯科着陆后，机场上的便衣特务几乎组成了“夹道欢迎”的人墙。中国学生乘车驶往市内时，前后警车“护送”。一路上开放绿灯。苏修当局害怕中国留学生的心情达到了无以复加的地步，他们甚至无理地坚持不让中国留学生乘坐的汽车经过市内闹区。
    一日晚，中国留波兰学生到达莫斯科时，在白俄罗斯车站上，也同样受到了“特殊礼遇”。警车、摩托车、带报话机的小汽车，一直把中国学生所乘的汽车“护送”到中国大使馆。中国学生一路高唱毛主席语录歌，把苏修警察吓得惊惶失措。
      机场戒备如临大敌
    二月一日，中国接运留学生的专机离开莫斯科这件事，竟然也使苏修当局惊恐万状。
    中国留学生和送行人员的汽车刚刚驶出中国大使馆，早已等候在中国大使馆周围的大批苏联警车、摩托车、带扩音喇叭的警车和小卡车尾随跟踪，形影不离，俨如护送某个外国来访的元首。中国留学生抵达机场时，里里外外，戒备森严，三步一哨，五步一岗，边防军人倍增，一个苏修上校军官亲临现场指挥。警察和便衣特务也布置得密密层层。
    苏修老爷以上种种丑态，表面上看来气壮如牛，骨子里却是胆小如鼠，这充分表明他们是地地道道的纸老虎。他们的丑行再一次证明了我们伟大的领袖毛主席的英明论断：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
