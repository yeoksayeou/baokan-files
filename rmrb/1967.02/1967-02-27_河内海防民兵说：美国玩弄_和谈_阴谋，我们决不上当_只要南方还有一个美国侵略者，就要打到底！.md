Hanoi and Haiphong militia members say: The U.S. is playing "peace talks" tricks, we will not fall for it! As long as there is one U.S. aggressor in the South, we will fight to the end!

Vietnamese newspapers hail the glorious victory of the military and people of Quang Ngai in annihilating and heavily defeating five enemy battalions

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 25 — Our correspondent reports: The militia self-defense troops of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and Haiphong, the second-largest city, have, after actual combat with American air pirates, shown high fighting spirit and morale. They are determined to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve national reunification.

Our correspondent recently visited some militia self-defense troops in Hanoi and Haiphong. These heroic warriors, who have fought against American air pirates, expressed to our correspondent their firm resolve and confidence to fight to the final victory.

A responsible person from a certain factory's militia self-defense team in Hanoi told our correspondent: "We militia self-defense troops all recognize that the nature of imperialism will not change. Look, isn't the U.S. imperialism continuing to send troops to South Vietnam? The 'peace talks' tricks played by the U.S. aggressors are a conspiracy. We will not fall for it."

Militia self-defense troop member A Zhang told our correspondent: "We will firmly follow Chairman Ho's teachings and fight to the end, definitely driving the U.S. aggressors out of South Vietnam."

A veteran of the anti-French war and a cadre from the South, A Qiang, who participated in the war, told our correspondent: "Against imperialism, we cannot be polite, we can only use an iron fist to deal with it. If the enemy sharpens his sword, we must also sharpen ours."

He firmly declared, "We are determined to fight the U.S. aggressors for five years, ten years, or even longer, until we drive them out of the South and reunify the motherland. We have unlimited confidence in victory. Just as Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

Militia self-defense troops from another factory in Hanoi proposed the slogan of "four fears not": not fearing intense warfare, not fearing prolonged fighting, not fearing hard living conditions, and not fearing production difficulties.

They unanimously told our correspondent: "As long as there is one U.S. aggressor in South Vietnam, we will fight to the end. We are day and night heartbroken by the separation of our kin in the North and South. We will not be slaves to the U.S. aggressors. Even if Hanoi and Haiphong are leveled, we will fight to the final victory."

A cadre from the South, A Cong, a militia self-defense troop member from a certain factory in Haiphong, emphasized to our correspondent: "No matter how many factories and enterprises the U.S. aggressors destroy, our people will never surrender."

He pointed out: "'Peace talks' are a big conspiracy. If we cannot finish it in this generation, the next generation will continue. We will resolutely and thoroughly drive the Americans out."

Militia self-defense troop member A Zhe said: "Chairman Mao said that imperialism is a paper tiger, which is completely correct. We will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought well, resolutely fight to the end, and achieve a thorough victory."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 24 — The Vietnamese newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" published editorials and comments on February 24, respectively, enthusiastically hailing the glorious achievements of the military and people of Quang Ngai Province in recent anti-"sweeping" battles in Son Tinh County, where they annihilated and heavily defeated five enemy battalions.

The editorial of "People's Daily" said that the consecutive victories achieved by the military and people of Quang Ngai Province prove that the people's war in Quang Ngai Province is developing. The armed forces of liberation always hold the initiative on the battlefield.

The editorial said that the recent glorious achievements of the military and people of Quang Ngai Province show their advantage of taking the initiative to attack and their will to decisively defeat the American bandits. "These victories are a heavy blow to the American bandits' attempt to 'pacify' this region. At the same time, these victories also smash the American bandits' claim that the armed forces of liberation cannot fight large-scale battles and are forced to disperse and fight guerrilla warfare."

The comment of "People's Army Daily" said: "The glorious achievements of the military and people of Quang Ngai Province more vividly illustrate the invincible power of the people's war, the unity and fighting power of the three armed forces, and the unity of the military and the people in fighting the enemy and saving the country."

    河内海防民兵说：美国玩弄“和谈”阴谋，我们决不上当
    只要南方还有一个美国侵略者，就要打到底！
    越南报纸欢呼南越广义军民一举全歼和重创伪军五个营的辉煌战果
    新华社河内二十五日电　本社记者报道：越南首都河内和第二大城市海防市民兵自卫队员，经过同美国空中强盗的实际较量，斗志昂扬，意气风发，他们决心响应胡志明主席的号召，彻底击败美国侵略者，实现国家的统一。
    记者不久以前访问了河内和海防的一些民兵自卫队员，这些参加过打击美国空中强盗的英雄战士们，向记者表达了他们战斗到最后胜利的坚强决心和信心。
    河内市某工厂的民兵自卫队负责人对记者说：“我们民兵自卫队员都认识到，帝国主义的本质是不会变的。你看，美帝国主义不是正在继续向南越增兵吗？美国侵略者玩弄的‘和谈’花招，是一种阴谋。我们决不上它的当。”
    民兵自卫队员阿长对记者说：“我们坚决按照胡主席的教导战斗到底，一定把美国侵略者赶出越南南方。”
    参加过抗法战争的老战士、南方集结干部阿强对记者说：“对帝国主义不能讲客气，只能用铁拳头对付它。敌人磨刀，我们也要磨刀。”
    他坚决表示“我们决心同美国侵略者打五年、十年或更长的时间，直到把它赶出南方，统一祖国为止。我们对胜利充满无限信心。正象毛主席所指出的，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。”
    河内市另一家工厂的民兵自卫队员们提出了四不怕的口号：不怕战争激烈、不怕长期战斗、不怕生活艰苦、不怕生产困难。
    他们向记者一致表示：“只要越南南方还有一个美国侵略者，我们就战斗到底。我们为亲人南北分离而日夜心痛。我们决不给美国侵略者当奴隶。即使河内、海防被夷平，我们也要战斗到最后胜利。”
    海防市某工厂民兵自卫队员、南方集结干部阿丛对记者强调说：“不管美国侵略者炸毁我们多少工厂企业，我国人民也决不屈服。”
    他指出：“‘和谈’是个大阴谋。我们这一代打不完，下一代继续打，我们要坚决、彻底地把美国佬赶出去。”
    民兵自卫队员阿哲说：“毛主席说过，帝国主义是纸老虎，这是完全正确的。我们一定好好学习毛泽东思想，坚决战斗到底，取得彻底的胜利。”
    新华社河内二十四日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》二十四日分别发表社论和评论，热烈欢呼越南南方广义省军民最近在山晶县反“扫荡”战斗中，一举全歼和重创伪军五个营的辉煌战果。
    《人民报》的社论说，广义省军民接连取得的胜利证明，广义省的人民战争日益发展。解放武装力量时刻掌握着战场上的主动权。
    社论说，广义省军民最近取得的辉煌战绩，显示了他们的主动进攻优势和决战决胜美国强盗的意志。“这些胜利是对美国强盗妄图‘绥靖’这个地区的阴谋的沉重打击。同时，这些胜利也粉碎了美国强盗散布的所谓解放武装力量不能打大规模战斗，被迫分散打游击战的论调。”
    《人民军队报》的评论说：“广义省军民的辉煌战功，更加突出地说明了人民战争的无敌威力，说明了三种武装力量之间的团结战斗力量和军民同心协力，共同杀敌救国的团结力量。”
