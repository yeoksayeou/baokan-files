The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has taken the lead in staging an anti-China farce. Over the past few months, Soviet revisionist newspapers and magazines have published and reprinted hundreds of anti-China articles and materials. These articles and materials are all poisonous weeds.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons must be criticized. We must not allow them to spread freely." We must thoroughly criticize the poisonous weeds of the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionists have been slandering our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as "anti-Soviet."

Modern revisionists have used this trick before. Remember, didn't Khrushchev also use the charge of being "anti-Soviet" to intimidate us? History has proven that it was not us who were anti-Soviet, but Khrushchev, the great traitor. Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is repeating the same old tricks, "using the banner to cover themselves and scare others," dressing themselves up as the embodiment of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and labeling those who oppose them as "anti-Soviet." What a great "weapon"!

The successors of Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism, Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk, have been vigorously promoting the notorious "state of the whole people," "party of the whole people," advocating "material incentives," "the ruble as the commander," cultivating a high-salary stratum, advocating bourgeois "freedom" and "democracy," suppressing revolutionary masses, changing the nature of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a bourgeois party, and carrying out the evil restoration of capitalism. You, this small handful of revisionist leaders, have changed the color of the Soviet Union, implementing bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union.

You have colluded with the vicious enemies of the people of the world, American imperialism, acting as a guerrilla force for American imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy. You have been vigorously promoting "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," "peaceful transition," numbing the revolutionary will of the people of the world, pushing for the restoration of capitalism in the socialist world, and maintaining the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world. You are slaves who have knelt down before imperialism.

You, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, are the monsters and demons of the world, traitors to the international communist movement, traitors to the Soviet people and the people of the world. Just like the capitalist-roaders in power within our party, you are just a small handful. You have no great power. You are paper tigers.

"Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and tigers." We, the Chinese people and Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of demons, not afraid of imperialism, not afraid of reactionaries in various countries, and we certainly do not put you, this small handful of revisionists, in our eyes.

All counter-revolutionaries must be overthrown. You, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, this bunch of anti-communist, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China elements, why can't we overthrow you?

"The thousands of truths of Marxism, in the end, boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" To rebel against you is right, good, and justified!

You have betrayed Marxism-Leninism. If we do not rebel against you, how can we?

You have carried out the restoration of capitalism. If we do not rebel against you, how can we?

You have created divisions and sabotaged the international communist movement. If we do not rebel against you, how can we?

You pretend to be anti-imperialist but actually surrender, obstructing and sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. If we do not rebel against you, how can we?

You have been madly anti-China, brutally suppressing our students studying abroad, and savagely beating our diplomatic personnel. If we do not rebel against you, how can we?

No! A thousand times no! Ten thousand times no!

We will definitely rebel against you. To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism. We will thoroughly expose your traitorous faces of betraying Marxism-Leninism, betraying the great Lenin, betraying the international proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations, betraying the Soviet people and the people of socialist countries!

We firmly believe that the broad masses of the Soviet people want revolution. They will certainly carry forward the glorious tradition of daring to revolutionize and dare to struggle, and rise up to rebel against you. "If the heavens have feelings, the heavens will age; the righteous way in the world is change." The Soviet Union has hope, and that hope lies with the revolutionary rebels in the Soviet Union. They are the gravediggers of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

The Soviet Union will definitely belong to the great Soviet people!

### 给列宁的叛徒贴张大字报

    给列宁的叛徒贴张大字报
    苏联修正主义领导集团，充当了反华丑剧的急先锋。几个月来，苏修的报刊杂志，发表和转载了几百篇反华的文章和材料。这些文章和材料，统统都是大毒草。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”对苏修的大毒草，我们一定要给以彻底的批判。
    苏修疯狂地诬蔑我国的无产阶级文化大革命是什么“反苏”。
    现代修正主义者使用这种手法，也并不是头一次。想当年，赫鲁晓夫不是也拿“反苏”的罪名吓过我们吗？事实证明，反苏的不是我们，恰恰是赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒。现在，苏修领导集团又故技重演，“拉大旗作为虎皮，包着自己，去吓唬别人”，把自己打扮成苏联和苏联人民的化身，把反对他们的人，都加上“反苏”的罪名。这算得上什么了不起的“法宝”？
    继承赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的衣钵的勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流，你们大肆宣扬臭名远扬的“全民国家”、“全民党”，鼓吹“物质刺激”、“卢布挂帅”，培植高薪阶层，提倡资产阶级的“自由”、“民主”，镇压革命群众，改变苏联共产党的无产阶级政党的性质，实行罪恶的资本主义复辟。你们这一小撮修正主义领头人改变了苏联的颜色，在苏联实行资产阶级专政。
    你们勾结世界人民的凶恶敌人美帝国主义，充当美帝国主义反革命全球战略的别动队。你们极力宣扬“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”、“和平过渡”，麻痹世界人民的革命意志，在社会主义世界推行资本主义复辟，在资本主义世界维护帝国主义、殖民主义的统治。你们是跪倒在帝国主义脚下的奴仆。
    你们，苏修领导集团，是世界上的牛鬼蛇神，是国际共产主义运动的叛徒，是苏联人民和世界人民的叛徒。你们正象我国党内走资本主义道路的当权派一样，只是一小撮。你们没有什么了不起的力量。你们是纸老虎。
      “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”我们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和红卫兵小将，不怕鬼，不怕魅，不怕帝国主义，不怕各国反动派，更不把你们这一小撮修正主义者放在眼里。
    凡是反革命，统统都要打倒。你们，苏修领导集团，这帮反共、反人民、反革命、反华的家伙，为什么反不得呢？
      “马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”造你们的反，就是造得对，造得好，造得有理！
    你们背叛马克思列宁主义，不造你们的反，怎么行呢？
    你们实行资本主义复辟，不造你们的反，怎么行呢？
    你们制造分裂，破坏国际共产主义运动，不造你们的反，怎么行呢？
    你们假反帝，真投降，阻挠和破坏世界人民的革命斗争，不造你们的反，怎么行呢？
    你们疯狂反华，血腥镇压我国留学生，野蛮殴打我国外交人员，不造你们的反，又怎么行呢？
    不行！一千个不行！一万个不行！
    我们造你们的反，造定了。反帝必须反修。我们要彻底揭露你们背叛马克思列宁主义，背叛伟大的列宁，背叛国际无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族，背叛苏联人民和社会主义各国人民的叛徒面目，把你们暴露在光天化日之下！
    我们坚定不移地相信，广大的苏联人民是要革命的。他们一定会发扬敢于革命，敢于斗争的光荣传统，起来造你们的反。“天若有情天亦老，人间正道是沧桑。”苏联是有希望的，希望就在苏联的革命造反派身上。他们是苏联修正主义领导集团的掘墓人。
    苏联一定属于伟大的苏联人民！
