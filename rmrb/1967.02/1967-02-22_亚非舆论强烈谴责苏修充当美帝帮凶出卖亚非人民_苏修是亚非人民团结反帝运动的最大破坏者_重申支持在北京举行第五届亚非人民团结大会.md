	Asian and African opinions strongly condemn the Soviet revisionists for acting as accomplices of U.S. imperialism and betraying the Asian and African peoples. The Soviet revisionists are the greatest saboteurs of the Asian and African peoples' united anti-imperialist movement. They reaffirm support for holding the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing.

	BEIJING, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) - The Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers today issued a statement strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists and their small clique of followers for forcibly and illegally overturning the resolution passed at the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Winnipeg regarding the holding of the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. This action openly split the Asian and African peoples' united anti-imperialist movement.

	The statement said that the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers resolutely supports the statement issued by the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity on February 3, 1967, and is determined to stand with all revolutionary anti-imperialist fighters and peoples of Asian and African countries who uphold revolutionary principles. They will firmly support the relevant decisions made in Winnipeg and support the holding of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in China this year.

	The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have always been the greatest saboteurs and traitors of the Asian and African peoples' united anti-imperialist movement. People remember that a year ago, the Soviet revisionists and their small clique of followers tried every means to politically and organizationally split and sabotage the revolutionary Asian and African writers' movement. However, they suffered a miserable defeat in the face of the resolute counterattack by Asian and African writers and peoples. Today, the Soviet revisionists have committed a new crime against the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa in Nicosia, openly splitting the Asian and African peoples' solidarity movement. Thus, they have shamefully betrayed the interests of the Asian and African peoples and served U.S. imperialism. This once again proves that the Soviet revisionists are the sworn enemies of hundreds of millions of Asian and African peoples, and the number one accomplice of the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism. The Asian and African writers and peoples are fully convinced that the Soviet revisionists' conspiracies will suffer even more miserable failures. They cannot escape the fate of "making trouble, failing, making more trouble, failing more, until they perish." After removing the stumbling block of the Soviet revisionists, the Asian and African peoples' united anti-imperialist movement will develop and flourish even more.

	The Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers called upon Asian and African writers and peoples to unite and thoroughly smash all the conspiracies and tricks of the Soviet revisionists to sabotage the Asian and African peoples' united anti-imperialist cause.

	CAIRO, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) - Spokesman for the National Liberation Committee of Congo (Leopoldville) Constantino Kibwe and Emmanuel Kabasuba, a member of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Committee, issued a joint statement here today. They solemnly announced that they would participate in the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing this year. They strongly condemned the criminal activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership in collusion with U.S. imperialism to sabotage and split the Asian and African peoples' united anti-imperialist movement.

	The statement said: "The conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists has been exposed in broad daylight at the so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting held in Nicosia. The Soviet revisionists, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, have long been frantically sabotaging the anti-imperialist solidarity of the Asian and African peoples and the revolutionary struggle of the Asian and African peoples for independence and socialism."

	The statement went on to say: "They (the Soviet revisionists) have instigated a comprehensive split in the Asian and African solidarity movement in order to further betray the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the two continents of Asia and Africa, and to trample on the true meaning of anti-imperialist solidarity between Asia and Africa. They must bear full responsibility for this entire situation."

	The statement emphasized: "The decision made in Nicosia to change the venue of the Fifth Conference is an illegal measure serving the imperialists. This completely illegal decision cannot alter the resolution passed at the Winnipeg Conference, which has the right to designate Beijing as the venue for the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. The resolution of the Winnipeg Conference is the only valid resolution, and therefore any independent and genuine Asian and African organization must participate in the Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing without being influenced by anything."

	The statement, in the name of all the frontline fighters and revolutionary people of Congo (Leopoldville), condemned the illegal decision to change the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which was concocted by the masterminds behind the so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council. It reaffirmed that they would participate in the only legitimate Fifth Conference to be held in the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing. The statement expressed the belief that "the Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing will launch more fierce attacks on imperialism and reactionaries and will enhance the courage of the peoples of various countries in their struggle against the old and new colonialism and imperialism led by the United States."

	PHNOM PENH, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) - The Cambodian newspaper "New Telegram" today commented on the recent illegal convening of the so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council by the Soviet revisionist leadership. It said: "Everyone has seen the true face of those who were behind the scenes in Nicosia. Everyone has also seen through the treacherous deeds of the traitors who betrayed the anti-imperialist cause. They do not miss any opportunity to act as lackeys of the Washington boss."

	The commentary said: The so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council illegally changed the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference from Beijing to Algiers. This "fully exposes the split activities of that group of people who use the 'socialist label' to serve U.S. imperialism and sabotage Asian and African solidarity and the world anti-imperialist front."

	The commentary pointed out: This group of cunning and hypocritical people betrayed the Cuban people in the Caribbean crisis in a disgraceful manner. It is precisely this small clique of capitulationists who are eager to pursue a policy of collusion and coexistence with the aggressors of various countries—the U.S. imperialists. They are now frantically helping Washington with the "peace talks" fraud on the Vietnam issue. The commentary said that their treacherous deeds can also be seen clearly from their recent fascist atrocities against Chinese students.

	The commentary emphasized: These people "are currently intensifying their sabotage and split activities in all countries and places where they can interfere." "Acting as accomplices of imperialism, pursuing the same goals as imperialism—to jointly rule the world."

    亚非舆论强烈谴责苏修充当美帝帮凶出卖亚非人民
    苏修是亚非人民团结反帝运动的最大破坏者
    重申支持在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会
    新华社二十一日讯  亚非作家常设局今天发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者及其一小撮追随者在最近策划的尼科西亚分裂会议上，强行非法推翻温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，从而公开分裂了亚非人民团结反帝运动。
    声明说，亚非作家常设局坚决支持中国亚非团结委员会一九六七年二月三日的声明，并决心同所有坚持革命原则的亚非各国反帝战士和人民一起，坚决支持温尼巴的有关决定，支持今年在中国召开第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    声明指出，苏修一直是亚非人民团结反帝运动的最大的破坏者和叛徒。人们记得，一年以前，苏修及其一小撮追随者曾经千方百计地从政治上和组织上分裂和破坏革命的亚非作家运动。但是他们在亚非作家和人民的坚决反击下遭到了惨败。今天苏修又在尼科西亚对亚非革命人民犯下了新的罪行，竟然公开分裂了亚非人民团结运动。这样，他们就可耻地出卖了亚非人民的利益，为美帝国主义效劳。这又一次证明了：苏联修正主义者是亿万亚非人民的死敌，是全世界人民的公敌美帝国主义的头号帮凶。亚非作家和人民完全相信，苏修这些阴谋将遭到更惨重的失败。他们逃脱不了“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的命运，而亚非人民团结反帝的运动在踢开了苏修绊脚石以后将更为蓬勃地发展壮大。
    亚非作家常设局在声明中呼吁亚非作家和人民团结起来，彻底粉碎苏修破坏亚非人民团结反帝事业的一切阴谋诡计。
    新华社开罗二十日电　刚果（利）全国解放委员会发言人康斯坦丁·基布韦和全国解放委员会中央委员埃曼纽埃尔·卡巴苏巴博，二十日在这里向报界发表联合声明，郑重宣布将参加于今年在北京举行的第五届亚非人民团结大会；并强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，破坏和分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪恶活动。
    声明说：“在尼科西亚举行的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议上，苏联修正主义的阴谋已经暴露在光天化日之下。苏修同美帝狼狈为奸，很久以来一直在拚命破坏亚非人民的反帝团结，破坏亚非人民争取独立和争取社会主义胜利的革命。”
    声明接着说：“他们（苏修）挑起了亚非团结运动的全面分裂，以便进一步出卖越南人民和亚非两大洲人民的革命利益，以便蔑视亚洲和非洲之间的真正反帝团结的意义。他们必须对这一整个局势承担责任。”
    声明强调指出：“在尼科西亚作出的改变第五届大会地点的决定，是为帝国主义者效劳的一个非法措施。这一完全非法的决定不能篡改温尼巴大会所通过的决议，温尼巴大会完全有权选定北京为举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的地点。温尼巴决议是唯一有效的决议，因此任何独立自主和名副其实的亚非组织，必须不受任何影响而参加将在北京举行的第五届大会。”
    声明以刚果（利）全体前线战士和革命人民的名义，谴责所谓的第八届亚非团结理事会的幕后操纵者一手炮制出来的改变第五届亚非人民团结大会地点的非法决定，并重申将参加预定在中华人民共和国首都北京举行的唯一合法的第五届大会。声明表示确信，“将在北京举行的这次大会将对帝国主义和反动派发出更猛烈的炮火，并将提高为反对以美国为首的新老殖民主义和帝国主义而斗争的各国人民的勇气。”
    新华社金边二十日电　柬埔寨《新电讯报》二十日就苏联修正主义领导集团最近强行非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会发表评论说：“谁都认清了在尼科西亚躲在幕后的那些家伙的嘴脸。大家也都识破了背叛反帝事业的叛徒的所作所为，他们不放弃任何机会充当华盛顿头目的走卒。”
    评论说：所谓第八届亚非团结理事会非法地把第五届亚非人民团结大会从北京改到阿尔及尔，这“充分说明了那一伙人的分裂活动，他们利用‘社会主义标签’为美帝效劳，破坏亚非团结和世界反帝斗争阵线。”
    评论指出：这伙狡诈虚伪的家伙们，在加勒比海危机中可耻地背叛了古巴人民。正是这一小撮热中于奉行同各国人民的侵略者——美帝国主义合伙和共处的投降主义者，现在正在拚命帮助华盛顿在越南问题上搞“和平谈判”的骗局。评论说，他们的背叛行为也可从他们最近对中国留学生的法西斯暴行看得一清二楚。
    评论强调指出，这伙人“目前正在他们所能插足的一切国家和一切场所加紧进行破坏和分裂活动。”“充当帝国主义的帮凶，追求和帝国主义一样的目标——合伙主宰世界。”
