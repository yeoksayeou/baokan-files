Red Rebel Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

Today, I, along with Comrade Song Renqiong and Comrade Yu Ping from the Northeast Bureau, participate in the Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Great Alliance Great Seizure of Power Oath-Taking Rally. My heart is filled with excitement, and I feel extremely honored and happy. I resolutely stand with the Red Rebel comrades to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This power we seize is correct, and we seize it well! I warmly congratulate the birth of the Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee and salute all the Red Rebels in the province!

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the current situation of the Cultural Revolution in our province is extremely good. The proletarian revolutionary masses have united and, with an irresistible momentum, launched the struggle to seize power, achieving great victories. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have also made mistakes. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, I have resolutely corrected my mistakes and stood firmly on Chairman Mao's side. I diligently study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I stand with the Red Rebel comrades, learn from them, and be their student. Under the leadership of the Provincial Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee, I will raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a province-wide seizure of power struggle, thoroughly smash the reactionary economism, do a good job in seizing the revolution and promoting production, turn Black Dragon River Province into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our province through to the end. I solemnly pledge to fight alongside the Red Rebel comrades and achieve victory together.

Long live the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary masses!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!
