Edition: 6

The schemes and tricks of the bourgeois reactionary line have all been exposed and smashed by the revolutionary rebels. Now, you are using salary increases and welfare benefits as bait, attempting to make the revolutionary rebels turn their guns around and shift the target of the struggle; attempting to make the Cultural Revolution fail and let you escape unscathed! Ha ha! Gentlemen! You have misjudged the situation. We are people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Our eyes are the brightest, our hearts are the reddest, and our feet are the most firmly planted. We will uproot the roots of Chinese revisionism and make the red flag fly over the globe! Do you think a few stinking dollars can buy the souls of the revolutionary rebels? Not a chance! Not a chance! Not a chance! Your new schemes, new challenges, new counterattacks have failed, failed again! We cheer, we leap for joy. The situation of the Cultural Revolution is excellent! The death knell of the bourgeois reactionary line has sounded, and the revolutionary rebels have sounded the charge to totally attack the bourgeois reactionary line.

"Grasp revolution, promote production." We carry two heavy burdens on one shoulder, running swiftly, running swiftly, running swiftly along the revolutionary road personally opened by Chairman Mao!

    沿着毛主席开辟的革命大道猛跑
    潘志光资产阶级反动路线的一个个阴谋，一
  个个花招，都被革命造反派识破了，粉碎了。如今你们又用加工资，增福利作诱
  饵，妄想叫革命造反派炮口转向，转移斗争的目标；妄想叫文化大革命夭折，让你们逃之夭夭！嘿嘿！老爷们，先生们！你们瞎了眼，把人看错了。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，眼最亮，心最红，脚跟站得最牢。我们要把中国的修正主义根子挖掉，要叫寰球红旗飘！几个臭钱，想把革命造反派的灵魂收
  买？一百个办不到！一千个办不到！一万
  个办不到！你们的新阴谋、新挑战、新反扑，失败了，又失败了！我们欢呼，我们跳跃，文化大革命的形势无限好！资产阶级反动路线的丧钟敲响了，革命造反派吹响了向资产阶级反动路
  线总攻的冲锋号。
  “抓革命，促生产”。两副重担一肩挑，沿着毛主席亲手开辟的革命大道，猛跑！猛跑！猛跑！
