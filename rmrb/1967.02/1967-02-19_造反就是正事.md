Rebellion is the right thing to do. The dawn breaks,
A thousand thunderclaps open a new universe, and a million-mile east wind sweeps away the remaining clouds. The revolutionary rebels among the peasants have broken through numerous obstacles and emerged, igniting the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution in the vast rural areas! This has disrupted the sweet dreams of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. These scoundrels spread malicious rumors, saying that the revolutionary rebel peasants "do not do the right thing."

This is completely a distortion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white.

What "right thing" do you do? When the masses rise up to make a revolution, you shout "promote production," attempting to use production as a pretext to suppress the revolutionary flames. When the masses are making a revolution on one hand and doing production with the attitude of masters on the other, you shout "grasp the revolution," drop your responsibilities, and incite the masses to fight each other. You are playing tricks, aiming to slip by and keep your "official hats."

We, the revolutionary rebel peasants, are doing the right thing by rebelling.

Rebelling against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, this is the right thing we are doing. Those scoundrels have one face in public and another in private, trying to lead us down the capitalist path. We must rebel against them, ensuring that our socialist country never changes color, and turning the countryside into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Such a major matter concerning the future and destiny of the country, if we do not handle it, who will? If we do not rebel against them now, when will we?

Grasp the revolution, promote production, this is the right thing we are doing. Some people drop their responsibilities, we take them up; some people lie down and do nothing, we do it. Chairman Mao teaches: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world." The key to a year's work lies in the spring. The vast rural areas are about to enter the busy spring planting season. While we are igniting the revolutionary fire and fanning the winds of rebellion, we must, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, seize every minute to get the preparatory work done and plant the crops well, making production flourish.

Strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, this is the right thing we are doing. Currently, a handful of ghosts and monsters are coming out of their holes, attempting to stage a comeback. We must impose dictatorship on them, allowing them to behave only in an orderly manner, not allowing them to cause trouble.

Water and fire do not share the same stove, good and evil do not walk the same path. The revolutionary rebel peasants and the capitalist-roaders within the Party have fundamentally different views on what the "right thing" is. "Rebellion is justified." You think rebellion is not the "right thing," we think this is precisely the "right thing." This major matter must be done, otherwise, capitalism will stage a comeback.

The "not doing the right thing" argument is one of the methods used by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to suppress the revolution and tie the hands of revolutionary peasants. The deepening of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside and the uprising of hundreds of millions of peasants signify the end of their days. They want us to obediently follow their baton, this is a pipe dream!

    造反就是正事
    曙光
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。革命造反派的农民冲破重重阻拦“杀”出来了，在广大农村中点燃起了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火！这可搅动了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的酣梦。这些坏家伙，煽阴风，点邪火，散布流言蜚语，说什么革命造反派的农民“不干正事”。
    这完全是颠倒是非，混淆黑白。
    你们干的是什么“正事”？当群众发动起来闹革命的时候，你们大叫“促生产”，企图借生产之名把革命的烈火压下去。当群众在一边闹革命，一边以主人公的态度搞好生产的时候，你们又大叫“抓革命”，撂下挑子不管，挑动群众斗群众。你们搞的是邪门歪道，目的就是想滑过去，保住你们的“乌纱帽”。
    我们革命造反派的农民起来造反，干的是革命的正事。
    造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，这就是我们所干的正事。那些坏家伙阴一套，阳一套，妄图把我们引到资本主义的邪路上去。我们要造他们的反，使我们社会主义的江山永不变色，把农村办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校。这样关系到国家前途和命运的大事，我们不管，谁管？此时不造他们的反，又待何时？
    抓革命，促生产，这就是我们所干的正事。有些人撂挑子不管，我们管；有些人躺倒不干，我们干。毛主席教导：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”一年之计在于春。广大农村即将进入春耕的农忙季节，我们要在大点革命之火，大煽造反之风的同时，以高度的革命责任感，争分夺秒，把备耕工作抓起来，把庄稼种得棒棒的，把生产搞得好好的。
    加强无产阶级专政，这就是我们所干的正事。目前，一小撮牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，妄图反攻倒算。我们就是要对他们实行专政，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。
    水火不同炉，善恶不同路。我们革命造反派的农民和党内走资本主义道路的当权派，对“正事”的看法是根本不同的。“造反有理。”你们认为造反不是“正事”，我们认为这正是“正事”。这个大事一定要干，如若不干，资本主义就会复辟。
      “不干正事”论，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派压制革命，束缚革命农民手脚的手法之一。无产阶级文化大革命的深入农村，亿万农民的奋起造反，正标志着他们末日的来临。他们要我们乖乖地顺着他们的指挥棒转，这是白日做梦！
