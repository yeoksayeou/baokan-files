The armed forces of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which have made new contributions in supporting the struggle for seizing power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, solemnly held a mobilization meeting on February 10 to resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in carrying out the struggle for seizing power to the end. The soldiers and officers solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao, the most beloved great leader: We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left, and put these instructions into better practice. We pledge to unite with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the entire province, fight together, and achieve victory together, to carry out the struggle for seizing power to the end, and make greater contributions to the establishment and consolidation of the new regime.

The editorial published by the People's Daily on the basic experiences of the struggle for seizing power by the Red Rebels of Heilongjiang Province has aroused a strong response among the soldiers and officers of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region. The soldiers and officers excitedly said: "This is the voice of Chairman Mao!" "This is the greatest trust, the greatest care, and the greatest encouragement from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to us!" Immediately, the soldiers and officers of the provincial military region held a mobilization meeting to resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in carrying out the struggle for seizing power to the end. Despite the severe cold, they marched in unison, beating drums and gongs, marching proudly and spiritedly from all directions to the venue. The venue was adorned with red flags, and shouts and slogans echoed, filled with a revolutionary fighting atmosphere.

The meeting began with the solemn song "The East Is Red." The soldiers and officers held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, attempting to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance."

Commander Wang Jiadao of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region spoke at the meeting. He said, Chairman Mao has called on us, the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, firmly and unshakably support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and resolutely and ruthlessly suppress all sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary organizations and elements.

Wang Jiadao said, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. We must learn from the brave Red Guards and revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, learn their daring to think, speak, act, and rebel; learn their fearlessness, their fearlessness in defending Chairman Mao's correct line; learn their revolutionary pioneering spirit of thoroughly criticizing the old world and creating a new world.

Finally, he, on behalf of all the soldiers and officers of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, pledged to Chairman Mao: We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

A representative from a certain unit that participated in suppressing the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" counter-revolutionary organization, Political Instructor Zhang Yongfu, expressed at the meeting that he would resolutely engrave Chairman Mao's great call in his mind, dissolve it in his blood, and implement it in action, wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in seizing power.

Amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers, the meeting passed a telegram of respect to the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

The meeting was filled with a strong revolutionary fighting atmosphere from beginning to end. The soldiers and officers waved their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" This demonstrated the People's Liberation Army's iron will and firm resolve to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, carry out the struggle for seizing power to the end, and seize back all the powers in party, government, economy, and culture that have been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

    新华社哈尔滨十二日电在支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中创立了新功的中国人民解放军黑龙江省军区部队，十日隆重举行坚决支持无产阶级革命派把夺权斗争进行到底誓师大会。指战员们向最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：坚决把毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的指示，更好地落实在行动上，誓和全省革命群众、革命干部团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把夺权斗争进行到底，为建设新政权，巩固新政权作出更大贡献。
    《人民日报》就黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验所发表的社论，在黑龙江省军区部队指战员中引起了强烈的反响。指战员们激动地说：“这是毛主席的声音！”“这是毛主席、党中央对我们的最大信任、最大关怀、最大鼓舞！”省军区部队指战员，当即举行坚决支持无产阶级革命派把夺权斗争进行到底誓师大会。他们冒着严寒，迈着整齐的步伐，敲锣打鼓，雄赳赳气昂昂，精神焕发地从四面八方来到会场。会场上红旗招展，欢呼声、口号声响成一片，充满了革命的战斗气氛。
    大会在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始。指战员们捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    黑龙江省军区司令员汪家道在大会上讲了话。他说，毛主席号召我们，人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，站在无产阶级革命造反派一边，坚定地、毫不动摇地支持无产阶级革命派，坚决地、狠狠地镇压反革命组织和反革命分子的一切破坏活动。
    汪家道说，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。我们要向英勇的红卫兵革命小将学习，向无产阶级革命造反派学习，学习他们敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级革命造反精神；学习他们天不怕、地不怕，誓死保卫毛主席的正确路线的大无畏精神；学习他们彻底批判旧世界、创造新世界的革命首创精神。
    最后他代表黑龙江省军区全体指战员向毛主席宣誓：永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同广大革命群众、革命干部紧密团结在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    参加镇压所谓“荣复军”反动组织的某部代表、政治指导员张永福在会上表示，坚决把毛主席的伟大号召刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，全心全意地、毫不含糊地支持无产阶级革命派夺权。
    在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，大会通过了给伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的致敬电。
    大会自始至终充满着强烈的革命战斗气氛，指战员们挥动红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”显示了人民解放军永远忠于毛主席，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，把夺权斗争进行到底，把被一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派篡夺的党、政、财、文等各种大权统统夺回来的钢铁意志和坚强决心。
