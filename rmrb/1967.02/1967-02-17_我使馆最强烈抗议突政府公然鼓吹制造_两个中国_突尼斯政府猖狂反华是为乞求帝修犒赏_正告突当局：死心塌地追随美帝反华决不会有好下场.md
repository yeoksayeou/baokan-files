Our embassy strongly protests the Tunisian government's open advocacy for creating "two Chinas."
The Tunisian government's rampant anti-China stance is to beg for rewards from imperialists and revisionists.
We warn the Tunisian authorities: Blindly following the U.S. imperialists in their anti-China stance will not end well.

	New China News Agency, February 16th: Tunisian news: On February 16th, Chinese Ambassador to Tunisia, Yao Nian, submitted a protest note to the Tunisian Foreign Ministry. The note strongly protests the Tunisian government and its leaders' open advocacy and creation of "two Chinas," their blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and their arrogant provocations towards the Chinese people. The full text of the note is as follows:

	The Embassy of the People's Republic of China informs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Tunisia as follows:

	According to a report in the February 8, 1967, issue of the Tunisian newspaper "Action," Tunisian Foreign Minister Bourguiba Jr. stated in an interview with the newspaper's reporter that the Tunisian government had adopted a position of abstention on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. He claimed, "We believe there are two Chinas: the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China."

	According to the same newspaper's report on the same day, the Tunisian government recently sent an economic delegation to Taiwan to sign an agricultural technical cooperation agreement with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is a puppet of U.S. imperialism and an enemy of the Chinese people.

	These two incidents clearly show that the Tunisian government and its leaders are not only advocating "two Chinas" verbally but are also actively creating "two Chinas" to serve the anti-China conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

	The Tunisian government and its leaders' actions are a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, an arrogant provocation towards the Chinese people, and an extreme and serious step to deliberately sabotage the normal relations between China and Tunisia. The Chinese people cannot but express great indignation. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China, on instructions, strongly protests to the Tunisian government.

	At present, the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries who harbor extreme hatred towards China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are launching a new wave of anti-China sentiment. The Tunisian government and its leaders, at this time, have come out to insist on colluding with the political corpse of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This is merely to show the imperialists and revisionists that Tunisia is firmly opposed to China, in order to curry favor and seek rewards. However, your collusion with the imperialists and revisionists against China is obviously against the interests of the Tunisian people and will not end well.

	We must solemnly point out that the Tunisian government and its leaders have long been following the U.S. imperialists in their anti-China stance. Over the past two years, the Chinese government has repeatedly offered advice and protests. The Chinese government has adopted such a restrained and patient attitude because we value Sino-Tunisian friendship. However, whether Sino-Tunisian relations can be consolidated and developed depends on the efforts of both sides. The Tunisian government and its leaders must stop in their tracks and cease their advocacy and creation of "two Chinas." Otherwise, the deterioration of friendly relations between China and Tunisia will be inevitable. The Tunisian government and its leaders must bear full responsibility for this.

    我使馆最强烈抗议突政府公然鼓吹制造“两个中国”
    突尼斯政府猖狂反华是为乞求帝修犒赏
    正告突当局：死心塌地追随美帝反华决不会有好下场
    新华社十六日讯　突尼斯消息：中华人民共和国驻突尼斯大使姚念十六日向突尼斯外交部递交了一份抗议照会，对突尼斯政府及其领导人公然鼓吹和制造“两个中国”、粗暴干涉中国内政、狂妄向中国人民挑衅的言行，提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国大使馆向突尼斯共和国外交部通知如下：
    根据一九六七年二月八日突尼斯《行动报》的报道，突尼斯外交部长小布尔吉巴在接见该报记者，谈及突尼斯政府在联合国中国代表权问题上采取弃权态度时，竟然宣称，“我们认为，存在着两个中国：人民中国和国民党中国。”
    又据该报同一天消息，突尼斯共和国政府最近曾派遣经济代表团前去台湾，同美帝国主义走狗、中国人民的叛徒蒋介石集团签订了一个所谓农业技术合作协定。
    这两件事情充分说明，突尼斯政府及其领导人已经不仅仅在口头上鼓吹“两个中国”，而是进一步在实际行动上公然制造“两个中国”，来为美帝国主义的反华阴谋效劳。
    突尼斯政府及其领导人的这些言行，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，对中国人民的狂妄挑衅，是蓄意破坏中突两国正常关系的极端严重的步骤。中国人民对此不能不表示极大的愤慨。中华人民共和国大使馆奉命向突尼斯政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    目前，极端仇恨中国的伟大的文化大革命运动的帝国主义者、现代修正主义者以及各国反动派，正在掀起一个新的反华浪潮。突尼斯政府及其领导人在这个时候，跳了出来，坚持同蒋介石集团这具政治僵尸勾勾搭搭，这无非是为了要向帝修反表明突尼斯死心塌地敌视中国的立场，以便博取帝修反的欢心和犒赏而已。但是，你们勾结帝修反反华，显然是违背突尼斯人民的利益的，是不会有好下场的。
    我们要严正指出，突尼斯政府及其领导人追随美帝反华，由来已久。两年以来，中国政府曾经多次提出规劝和抗议。中国政府采取这样克制和等待的态度，是因为我们以中突友谊为重。但是，中突关系能否巩固和发展，须取决于双方的努力。突尼斯政府及其领导人必须悬崖勒马，停止宣扬和制造“两个中国”的言行。否则，中突两国友好关系的恶化，将是不可避免的。对此，突尼斯政府及其领导人必须担负全部责任。
