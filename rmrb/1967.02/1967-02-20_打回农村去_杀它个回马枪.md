The class struggle in the countryside of Shanghai's suburbs has taken on a new look, with revolutionary peasants, led by poor and lower-middle peasants, rising up in rebellion! We warmly applaud the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement. We enthusiastically respond to the call of the second "Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" and unite with the revolutionary peasants, fight alongside them, and achieve victory together, to carry the Cultural Revolution in the countryside to the end!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "...All the intellectual youth and student youth in the country must combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and become one with them, to form a powerful army. This is an army of tens of millions of people! With this great army, we can attack and smash the enemy's strongholds, and attack and smash the enemy's last bastion." When we respond to Chairman Mao's great call and rise up in rebellion with the revolutionary peasants, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are flustered. They have whipped up a counter-revolutionary revisionist wind of economism, inciting some up-to-the-mountains-and-down-to-the-villages intellectual youth to return to the cities and put forward unreasonable economic demands. They have also sent us from the front lines of agricultural production to "work" in commune-run enterprises; they have even arbitrarily signed documents to incite us to transfer our household registrations to the cities. Their purpose is to shift the direction of the struggle and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. We have timely exposed this great plot. Most of the comrades who have come to the cities have already returned to the countryside in the past two days. The counter-revolutionary revisionist wind of economism whipped up by a handful of scoundrels has been beaten back! Their scheme to lure the tiger away from the mountain has failed!

We suggest that all up-to-the-mountains-and-down-to-the-villages intellectual youth who have flowed into the cities quickly "strike back to the hometown and make revolution on the spot," launch a counterattack, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

In the past, we intellectual youth responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao to go up to the mountains and down to the villages to make revolution. At present, the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside is good, and we need to fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary peasants. Over the past few years, we have participated in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and learned a lot from them. To carry out the Cultural Revolution with them, not only can we overthrow a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, sweep away the ghosts and snakes, and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, but we can also learn more from them. We must guard our posts and, together with the revolutionary peasants, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, strive to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, and strive to implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," to carry out the Cultural Revolution in the countryside thoroughly, deeply, and completely!

    上海郊区农村的无产阶级文化大革命出现了崭新的局面，以贫下中农为核心的革命农民起来造反了！我们热烈地欢呼革命农民运动的兴起。我们热烈地响应第二个《告上海全市人民书》发出的号召，和革命农民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席教导我们说：“……全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体，才能形成一支强有力的军队。这是一支几万万人的军队呵！有了这支大军，才能攻破敌人的坚固阵地，才能攻破敌人的最后堡垒。”当我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，和革命农民一道起来造反的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派慌了手脚。他们刮起了一股反革命修正主义的经济主义黑风，煽动一些上山下乡知识青年，回到城市，提出不合理的经济要求。他们还把我们从农业生产第一线安插到社办企业去“工作”；甚至胡乱签字，唆使我们把户口迁到城市。他们这样做的目的，就是为了转移斗争大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们及时识破了这个大阴谋，已经来到城市的，绝大多数的同志，这两天已经陆续回到农村去了。一小撮坏蛋刮起的经济主义黑风被打退了！他们的调虎离山计破产了！
    我们建议，一切流入城市的上山下乡知识青年，赶快“打回老家去，就地闹革命”，杀它个回马枪，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    过去，我们知识青年响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，上山下乡，就是为了干革命。当前，农村无产阶级文化大革命的形势很好，正需要我们同革命农民并肩战斗。几年来，我们和贫下中农一道，参加了阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，向他们学习到了不少东西。和他们在一起搞无产阶级文化大革命，不仅能斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫牛鬼蛇神，完成一斗二批三改的战斗任务，同时也可以向他们学到更多的东西。我们一定坚守岗位，和革命农民一起，活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，努力宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，努力贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命搞深、搞透、搞彻底！
