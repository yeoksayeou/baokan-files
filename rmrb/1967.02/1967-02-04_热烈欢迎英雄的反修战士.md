Heroic anti-revisionist fighters, our dear comrades! You have happily returned to the side of Chairman Mao, and the seven hundred million people are extending their welcoming hands to you! Good fighters of Chairman Mao, our dear comrades! You have raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and recited the words of the great leader Chairman Mao. You have, to express the respect of the Chinese people for the October Revolution, paid homage to the remains of the great leader Lenin and the tomb of Stalin, fearing neither punches nor kicks, disregarding injuries and bloodshed. Shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, you have shouted, "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism!" This brilliant proposition has swept away the clouds of revisionism and warmed the hearts of the Soviet people! Singing, "Once we have annihilated them, the red sun will shine over the whole world!" This spirited song has shaken the hearts of the people of Lenin's homeland! Rise up! Rise up! Follow the great leader Mao Zedong, who is the most outstanding banner-bearer of Leninism! A handful of traitors are terrified of the truth and have resorted to violence. But the great Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and the blood of revolutionary fighters will not be shed in vain! This blood has once again exposed the traitors' true colors! This blood has once again shown that the Chinese people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are made of iron! This blood has vividly taught us that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be carried through to the end! This blood has further strengthened our conviction that imperialism and revisionism are two sides of the same coin! To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism! Let the revolutionary storm sweep the globe! Workers of the world, unite! Smash American imperialism! Smash Soviet revisionism! The banner of Leninism will once again be raised high in the homeland of the October Socialist Revolution! The sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought will shine red over the whole world!

    热烈欢迎英雄的反修战士
    解放军海军某部  世新英雄的反修战士，我们亲爱的战友！你们幸福地回到了毛主席身边，七亿人民向你们伸开欢迎的双手！毛主席的好战士，我们亲爱的战友！你们为了高举马克思列宁
  主义的大旗，朗读伟大导师毛主席的语
  录。你们为了转达中国人民对
  十月革命的敬意，瞻仰伟大导师列宁的遗容
  和斯大林墓，不怕拳打脚踢，不顾伤痛血流，肩并着肩，手挽着手，高呼：“社会主义制度终究要代
  替资本主义制度”！这金光闪闪的论断横扫修
  正主义的乌云，温暖了苏联人民的心
  头！高唱：“一旦把他们消灭干净，
  鲜红的太阳照遍全球！”这斗志昂扬的歌声
    震动着列宁故乡人的
        心头！起来！起来！跟着伟大的导师毛泽东，他就是列宁主义最卓越的
  旗手！一小撮叛徒最害怕真理的
  声音，他们心惊胆战，竟大打出
  手。但伟大的中国人民不是好
  惹的，革命战士的鲜血不会白
  流！这鲜血又一次戳穿了叛徒
  的嘴脸！这鲜血又一次表明中国人民是用毛泽东思想
  武装起来的硬骨头！这鲜血活生生地教育了我
  们，无产阶级文化大革命必须
  搞深、搞透！这鲜血更坚定了我们的信
  念，帝国主义和修正主义是一
  丘之貉！反帝必须反修！革命风暴扫全球！全世界无产者联合起来！大造美帝国主义的反！大造苏联修正主义的反！列宁主义的大旗必将在
  十月社会主义革命的故
    乡重新升起！毛泽东思想的阳光必将照
  红全球！（附图片）
