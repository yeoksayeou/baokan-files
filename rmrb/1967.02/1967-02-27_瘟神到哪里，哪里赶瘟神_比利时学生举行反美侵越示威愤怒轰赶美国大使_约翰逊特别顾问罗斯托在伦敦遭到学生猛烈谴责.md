Wherever the Plague God Goes, He Is Driven Away
Belgian Students Hold Anti-American Vietnam War Protests, Angrily Drive Away the U.S. Ambassador
Johnson's Special Advisor Rostow in London Faced with Students' Strong Condemnation

New York Times, Brussels, February 25 — According to a report by the weekly People's Voice on February 24, on February 21, students from Louvain University in Belgium shouted at the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Knight, "We want Vietnam, not American devils!" "Johnson is a murderer!"

That evening, the representative of American imperialism in Belgium, Knight, attempted to speak at a gathering attended by many so-called prominent figures to defend U.S. policy of aggression against Europe. At this time, more than 60 Belgian students and foreign students from Louvain University united and shouted anti-American imperialism slogans.

Knight tried several times to ascend the podium, but the protesting students firmly refused, and he was forced to sit down again. At the same time, he unreasonably demanded that the school authorities order the protest to stop.

The authorities called in police and security forces to forcibly drive the protesting students out of the venue. However, the students continued to shout, "Get out, American devils!" "We will win!"

Later, the students also protested in front of the city hall where a reception was held for Knight. Finally, this American ambassador fled in disgrace amidst the protesters' loud shouts of "We want Vietnam, not American devils!" and a chorus of boos.

Previously, students from the University of Brussels had also driven away the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Kaplan, and the Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Belgium, Floyd.

New York Times, London, February 24 — Yesterday, U.S. President Johnson's special advisor on foreign affairs, Rostow, was strongly condemned by angry students at a gathering at the University of Leeds in the UK. The student crowd held up signs and banners condemning Johnson as a murderer.

When Rostow began to speak about international relations, the crowd questioned him, booed him, and mocked him. The students shouted, "American devil, go to hell!" Students in the corridors and on the stairs also shouted, "Go back! American devils, go back!" Rostow, in a state of panic and disarray amidst the crowd's condemnation of U.S. aggression in Vietnam, was forced to retreat. At this time, about 100 people left the lecture hall in protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

    比利时学生举行反美侵越示威愤怒轰赶美国大使
    约翰逊特别顾问罗斯托在伦敦遭到学生猛烈谴责
    新华社布鲁塞尔二十五日电　据《人民之声》周刊二十四日报道：比利时卢万大学学生二十一日对美国驻比利时大使奈特高呼：“要越南，不要美国佬！”“约翰逊是杀人犯！”
    这一天晚上，美帝国主义在比利时的代表奈特企图在一次有大批所谓知名人士参加的集会上讲话，为美国对侵略欧洲的政策辩护。这时，卢万大学的六十多个比利时学生和外国学生团结在一起，高呼反对美帝国主义的口号。
    奈特几次想登上讲坛，但是示威学生坚决不答应，他被迫重新坐下来，同时无理地要求校方下令禁止示威。
    当局召来警察和保安部队，强行把示威学生赶出会场。但是学生们继续高呼：“美国佬滚出去！”“我们必胜！”
    接着，学生们又在为奈特举行招待会的市政府门前举行示威。最后，这个美国大使终于在示威者“要越南，不要美国佬”的响亮口号声和一片嘘声中狼狈地溜走了。
    在这以前，布鲁塞尔大学的学生也曾经轰走了美国助理国务卿帮办卡普兰和美国驻比利时大使馆秘书弗洛伊德。
    新华社伦敦二十四日电　美国总统约翰逊的外交事务特别顾问罗斯托昨天在英国利兹大学的一次集会上讲话时，遭到愤怒的学生猛烈谴责。学生群众举着标语牌和横幅，谴责约翰逊是杀人犯。
    当罗斯托大放厥词，发表关于国际关系的讲话时，群众纷纷向他提出责问，向他喝倒彩，讽刺他。学生们高呼：“美国佬混蛋！”在利兹大学走廊周围和在楼梯上的其他学生也高呼：“滚回去！美国佬滚回去！”罗斯托在群众对美国侵略越南的一片谴责声中，惊慌失措，狼狈不堪。这时，大约有一百多人退出了讲堂，抗议美国侵略越南。
