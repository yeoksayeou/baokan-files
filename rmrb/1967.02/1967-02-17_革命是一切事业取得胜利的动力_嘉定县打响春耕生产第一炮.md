Revolution is the driving force for the victory of all undertakings – Jiading County fires the first shot for spring farming production

Revolutionary rebels correctly implement the party's policy on cadres, and many revolutionary grassroots cadres are in high spirits leading production

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15 – The revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiading County, Shanghai, have swiftly launched a spring production campaign in the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, laying a solid foundation for a new all-around leap in agricultural production this year.

The new high tide of spring production currently sweeping Jiading County is a necessary development and an important component of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is vigorously unfolding in this county. Since the peasant movement in this county began in mid-December last year, the broad revolutionary rebels and poor and lower-middle peasants, with the great revolutionary spirit of "being willing to suffer a thousand cuts but daring to pull the emperor off his horse," have exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of a handful of power-holders within the former Shanghai Municipal Committee, County Committee, and Commune Party Committee who took the capitalist road, opposed the Party, opposed socialism, and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. When these gentlemen stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind in the countryside, they resolutely resisted and smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. In just two months, this county has established a mighty cultural revolution army of 150,000 to 160,000 people. Subsequently, various revolutionary rebel groups implemented the great alliance of revolutionary leftists, and the boundless socialist production enthusiasm hidden within the broad masses erupted like a volcano, laying a solid political and ideological foundation for rapidly changing the production landscape and firing the first shot for spring farming production.

In the year-end distribution, the revolutionary rebels in this county, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "comprehensive planning and appropriate arrangements" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," defeated the evil plot of a handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line to increase distribution and sabotage the expansion of agricultural reproduction. They correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The vast majority of communes and production teams have reserved sufficient seeds and funds for expanded reproduction, ensuring the lives of the broad masses of commune members while creating good material conditions for spring farming production.

In the spring farming preparation work, the revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiading County have abandoned the reactionary line of only focusing on production and suppressing revolution, which was previously implemented by the former Shanghai Municipal Committee, County Committee, and Commune Party Committee in leading agricultural production. They have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary rebels and poor and lower-middle peasants have deeply felt that: revolution is the driving force for the victory of all undertakings. Focusing on production while suppressing revolution not only makes it impossible to truly improve production but also leads agriculture down the path of capitalism and revisionism. Only by grasping revolution can the broad revolutionary masses be mobilized to promote the development of agricultural production; only by grasping revolution can our country's agriculture advance along the socialist path. In recent times, this county has held several county-wide meetings to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and struggle against the power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road, further exposing and criticizing their crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. Many communes and production brigades have also held such meetings. Through these meetings, the broad masses have been further educated, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has been aroused. Each criticism and struggle meeting is a revolutionary oath-taking meeting and also a spring farming mobilization meeting. The broad revolutionary masses are full of spirit and high morale. Chairman Mao said, "The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will?" We must display the spirit of masters and do a good job in spring farming preparation, letting these bad elements see!

Our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao said: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." In the current spring farming tide, the revolutionary rebels in Jiading County, following the party and Chairman Mao's consistent instructions to "be good at identifying cadres," "be good at using cadres," and "be good at cherishing cadres," have conducted specific analyses of cadres and treated them differently. For those who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and insist on not changing or are incorrigible, they are encouraged to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, actively examine themselves, and take the lead in the spring farming production frontline, standing tall and daring to lead production. At present, many grassroots revolutionary cadres in Jiading County are in high spirits and actively working with the broad revolutionary masses on the frontline of spring farming production. This is an important factor in the swift launch of the spring farming production campaign in Jiading County.

Our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." The various revolutionary rebel groups in Jiading County are currently gradually implementing the great alliance in the current spring farming production. The county's various revolutionary rebel groups have specially established a leading cadre to direct agricultural production throughout the county, mobilizing forces from all sides to invest in the first line of preparation.

At present, the preparation work in various communes and production teams in this county is still unbalanced, and the great alliance of revolutionary rebels and the leadership of spring farming production need to be further strengthened. They are determined to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp revolution, promote production, and strive for a greater and more all-around leap in agricultural production this year.

    革命是一切事业取得胜利的动力
    嘉定县打响春耕生产第一炮
    革命造反派正确执行党的干部政策，许多革命基层干部心情舒畅领导生产
    据新华社上海十五日电　上海市嘉定县革命造反派和广大贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，迅速地掀起了春季生产热潮，为全年农业生产新的全面跃进，打下了扎实基础。
    嘉定县正在掀起的春季生产新高潮，是这个县蓬勃开展的无产阶级文化大革命的必然发展，也是这个大革命的一个重要组成部分。这个县的农民运动从去年十二月中旬兴起以后，广大革命造反派和贫下中农以“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的革命精神，揭发批判了旧上海市委、县委和公社党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派犯下的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。当这些老爷们在农村掀起反革命经济主义黑风时，他们又坚决抵制，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。短短两个月，这个县已经建立起一支十五、六万人的浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。接着，各革命造反派实行无产阶级革命派大联合，蕴藏在广大群众之中的不可估量的社会主义生产积极性就象火山一样爆发出来，为迅速改变生产面貌，为打响春耕生产第一炮，奠定了坚实的政治基础和思想基础。
    在年终分配中，这个县的革命造反派根据毛主席“统筹兼顾、适当安排”，“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，击败了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子以增加分配来破坏扩大农业再生产的罪恶阴谋，正确地处理了国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系，绝大部分社队都留足了生产的种子和扩大再生产的资金，既保证了广大社员的生活，又为春耕生产创造了良好的物质条件。
    嘉定县革命造反派和广大贫下中农在春耕备耕工作中，摒弃了旧上海市委、县委、公社党委过去领导农业生产中所执行的只抓生产不搞革命甚至压革命的反动路线，坚定不移地执行了毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命造反派和贫下中农深深体会到：革命，这是一切事业取得胜利的动力。抓生产，压革命，不仅生产不可能真正搞好，还要使农业走到资本主义、修正主义的斜路上去。只有抓革命，才能发动起广大革命群众，促进农业生产的发展；也只有抓革命，才可能使我国农业沿着社会主义道路前进。最近以来，这个县连续举行了几次全县规模的批判资产阶级反动路线和斗争党内走资本主义道路当权派的大会，进一步揭发批判他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，许多公社、大队也都举行了这样的大会。通过这些大会，进一步教育了广大群众，激发了他们的革命热情。一次批判斗争大会，就是一个革命的誓师大会，也是一个春耕动员大会。广大革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬。毛主席说，“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”我们一定要发挥主人翁的精神把春耕备耕搞好，让这些坏家伙们看看！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”嘉定县革命造反派在正在兴起的春耕热潮中，根据党和毛主席一贯指示的要“善于识别干部”，“善于使用干部”，“善于爱护干部”的教导，对干部进行了具体分析，区别对待。对那些犯有错误，但还不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，鼓励他们虚心听取群众意见，主动检查，杀上春耕生产第一线，挺起腰杆大胆领导生产。目前，嘉定县许多基层革命干部，都心情舒畅、主动积极地和广大革命群众奋战在春耕生产的第一线上。这是嘉定县迅速掀起春耕生产热潮的重要因素。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”嘉定县各个革命造反派在当前的春耕生产中，正在逐步地实行大联合。全县各革命造反派专门成立了指挥全县农业生产的领导班子，调动各方面的力量，投入备耕第一线。
    目前，这个县的各公社、各生产队备耕工作发展还不平衡，革命造反派的大联合和春耕生产的领导工作还要进一步加强。他们决心进一步活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，力争今年的农业生产更大的更全面的跃进。
