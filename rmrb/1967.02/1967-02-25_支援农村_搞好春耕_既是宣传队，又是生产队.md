The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also being vigorously carried out on a certain island. The soldiers of the Third Company stationed on the island organized a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. They prepared performances, wrote wall newspapers, and organized the masses to listen to broadcasts, continuously propagating Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" to the island's people. The soldiers of the Third Company, while propagating, also actively assisted the local production teams in fishing and agricultural production with practical actions. When the fishermen go out to sea in the morning, the soldiers of the Third Company go to the shore to help the fishermen push the boats into the sea one by one. In the evening when the fishing boats return, everyone goes to the shore to pull them up one by one. This has become a daily routine, thus giving the island's people more time for revolution and production.

On the morning of February 14, it suddenly snowed heavily and the wind blew strongly. The soldiers of the Third Company thought: with the strong wind and heavy snow, it is not possible to work at sea, so we should let the fishermen go ashore as soon as possible to focus on the Cultural Revolution. They braved the wind and snow to go to the shore to help the people pull the boats, working for more than two hours. All the boats working at sea were pulled ashore, and the soldiers' cotton clothes were soaked and frozen, but their hearts were warm because they felt they had carried out the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. The production team's wheat needed fertilizer, but there was a shortage of fertilizer. The Third Company immediately sent the fertilizer collected by the company to the wheat fields of the production team.

The soldiers of the Third Company enthusiastically supported the island's people in their actions to grasp revolution and promote production, greatly encouraging the island's people. The community members worked hard during the day on fishing production, cultivating kelp, building terraces, digging drainage ditches, and preparing for flood prevention. In the evening, they studied Chairman Mao's works, criticized the bourgeoisie, and carried out revolution and production with great enthusiasm.

### 支援农村　搞好春耕  既是宣传队，又是生产队

    支援农村　搞好春耕
    既是宣传队，又是生产队
    无产阶级文化大革命在某地的一个海岛上也轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。守备在这个岛上的三连同志们，组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，编排节目，写墙报，组织群众收听广播，不断向岛上群众宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。三连的同志们一边宣传，一边以实际行动援助当地的生产队搞好渔业生产和农业生产。渔民早上要出海，三连的同志们就到海边帮助渔民把船一只一只推下海。傍晚渔船回来了，大家又到海边一只一只拉上岸。天天如此，已经成了“制度”，这样就使岛上群众闹革命搞生产的时间多了。
    二月十四日上午，突然下起大雪，刮起了大风，三连的同志们想：刮风下雪海上不能生产，应该让出海的社员尽快上岸，抓紧时间搞文化大革命。他们就冒着风雪，到海边帮助群众拉船，一直忙了两个多小时。在海上作业的船都拉上来了，同志们的棉衣也湿透了，冻成了冰，但心里是热呼呼的，因为大家感到自己执行了伟大领袖毛主席的指示。生产队的小麦要追肥，缺少肥料，三连立即把连队收集的肥料送到生产队的麦地里。
    三连的同志们满腔热情支持岛上群众抓革命促生产的行动，给岛上群众以极大的鼓舞。社员们白天搞好渔业生产，养殖海带，造梯田，挖排水沟，做好防涝准备。晚上学习毛主席著作，批判资产阶级，革命和生产搞的热火朝天。
