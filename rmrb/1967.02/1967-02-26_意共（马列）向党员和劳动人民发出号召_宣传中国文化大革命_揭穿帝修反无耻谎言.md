The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) recently issued a call to action, celebrating the great victories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. They praised Chairman Mao as the "teacher of the international proletariat" and urged party members to make promoting the Chinese Cultural Revolution an urgent task.

The call to action, published in the February 18 issue of the *Nuova Unità* newspaper, stated: "The Chinese Cultural Revolution is advancing with the force of a thunderstorm. Its victory is not only a great and positive event for the Chinese people but also for all of humanity. The Chinese revolution lays the foundation for the broadest and swiftest development of the world revolution."

The call to action pointed out, "True communists, Marxist-Leninists, and the broad masses of revolutionary people are jubilant over this," while "imperialists, reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and revisionists are enraged by it."

The call to action went on to say that despite the imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party's leadership engaging in shameless slander and attacks against Chairman Mao and the Chinese Cultural Revolution, "Chairman Mao's prestige and the reputation of the Cultural Revolution are growing ever higher."

The call to action exposed the treacherous nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership, stating that they betrayed the interests of the Vietnamese people. It said that the Soviet leaders conspired to undermine the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people and supported the American "peace talks" deception. It also mentioned that Podgorny's visit to the Vatican to pay respects to the Pope was unheard of, not only for a Marxist-Leninist but also for any honest working person.

The call to action enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's great achievements and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The call to action stated: "The reliable helmsman of the Chinese Communist Party and the seven hundred million Chinese people, the teacher of the international proletariat, Comrade Mao Zedong, is increasingly respected and loved by the people of various countries. The revisionists fear Mao Zedong Thought."

The call to action pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought has made great contributions to the creative development of Marxism-Leninism and to the scientific theories of dialectical and historical materialism."

The call to action concluded by urging the members of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) and the Italian working people to unite, expose the anti-China propaganda of the imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists, and emphasized that the urgent task is to promote the Chinese Cultural Revolution, learn from it, and more resolutely raise the red flag of the Italian socialist revolution to advance bravely.

    意共（马列）向党员和劳动人民发出号召
    宣传中国文化大革命　揭穿帝修反无耻谎言
    据新华社二十三日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）最近在一项号召书中，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的巨大胜利，热情称颂毛主席是“国际无产阶级的导师”，并且号召党员把宣传中国的无产阶级文化大革命作为一项刻不容缓的任务。
    这个刊登在十八日出版的《新团结报》上的意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会的号召书说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命正以雷霆万钧之势向前发展。它的胜利，不仅对中国人民来说，而且对于全人类来说，都是一个伟大和积极的事件。中国的革命为世界革命最广泛和迅速的发展打下了基础。”
    号召书指出，“真正的共产党员、马克思列宁主义者、广大的革命人民都为此而欢欣鼓舞”，而“帝国主义者、反动派、资产阶级和修正主义者却为此而恼怒”。
    号召书接着指出，尽管帝国主义者、反动派和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者对毛主席和中国的无产阶级文化大革命进行无耻的诽谤和攻击，但是，“毛主席的威望和无产阶级文化大革命的声誉却越来越高”。
    号召书揭露了苏联修正主义领导集团出卖越南人民利益的叛徒嘴脸。号召书说，苏联领导人阴谋瓦解越南人民的斗争意志，支持美国的“和谈”骗局。波德戈尔内前往教廷向罗马教皇致意，这不仅对一个马克思列宁主义者来说，是闻所未闻的事，就是对于一切正直的劳动人民来说，也是闻所未闻的事。
    号召书热情地称颂毛主席的伟大功勋和毛泽东思想的伟大光辉。
    号召书说，中国共产党和七亿中国人民的可靠舵手、国际无产阶级的导师毛泽东同志，越来越受到各国人民的崇敬和爱戴。修正主义者害怕毛泽东思想。
    号召书指出：毛泽东思想对马克思列宁主义的创造性发展、对辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的科学理论，作出了巨大的贡献。
    号召书最后呼吁意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）的党员和意大利劳动人民团结起来，揭露帝国主义者、反动派和现代修正主义者的反华宣传，并且指出，刻不容缓的任务是，宣传中国的无产阶级文化大革命，从中吸取教益，以便更加坚定地高举意大利社会主义革命的红旗奋勇前进。
