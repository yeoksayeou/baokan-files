	In order to better propagate the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, our magazine is soliciting copies of newspapers published by revolutionary rebel groups across the country. We hope that comrades from the revolutionary rebel groups will provide great assistance by sending five copies of each issue of your newspapers to the Red Flag Magazine Editorial Office.
