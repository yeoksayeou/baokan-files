The Revolutionary Faction of the Qingdao Production Materials Wholesale Station, after seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They focused on ensuring the supply of production materials for spring plowing and sowing. In the past twenty days, they have allocated 3,795 tons of production materials to rural areas within the province.

Previously, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party at this wholesale station did not consider the production needs of the countryside. They were indifferent to the losses in agricultural production caused by issues in the supply of production materials. After the Revolutionary Faction took power, following Chairman Mao's guidance of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," they planned production and orders based on the annual needs of the countryside. Currently, their main focus is on supporting spring plowing and sowing, organizing the procurement and supply of materials. To ensure that the goods are suitable, they conducted field investigations and supplied 160 tons of pesticides needed for spring sowing in cotton-producing and grain-producing areas. They also arranged for 70 tons of pesticides needed after spring sowing. They have also pre-allocated fertilizers needed for spring sowing, with over 2,200 tons already transported to rural areas in the past twenty days.

Previously, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, driven by the sole pursuit of profit, did not procure small-value, high-loss items like glass straws. Now, the Revolutionary Faction has procured over 5,000 glass straws from other places. Workers in charge of storage and warehousing have demonstrated a sense of ownership, ensuring that packaged materials are dispatched within three days, and incoming goods are stored and inspected on the same day.

    青岛生产资料批发站无产阶级革命派
    积极调拨生产资料支援春耕春种
    新华社济南二十五日电　青岛生产资料批发站无产阶级革命派，在夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，狠抓春耕、春种生产资料的供应，近二十天来调往省内农村的生产资料达三千七百九十五吨。
    过去，这个批发站的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不从农村的生产需要出发，对因生产资料供应存在问题而造成的农业生产损失无动于衷。无产阶级革命派夺权后，遵照毛主席教导的“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，从农村的全年需要着想，安排生产和订货；当前，则以支援春耕、春种为主，组织进货和供应。为了使商品对路，他们在下乡作调查研究的基础上，供应了产棉区和产粮区春种所需的农药一百六十多吨，对春种后所需的农药也安排了七十多吨。他们对春种所需的肥料提前调拨，在二十多天内已调运下乡两千二百多吨。
    过去，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派从单纯的营利观点出发，不进玻璃吸管等价值小、损失率高的小商品。现在，无产阶级革命派已从外地进了五千多支玻璃吸管。分管储运和仓库的革命职工，发扬了当家做主的精神，做到包装调出物资不超过三天，调入商品当日入库，当日验完。
