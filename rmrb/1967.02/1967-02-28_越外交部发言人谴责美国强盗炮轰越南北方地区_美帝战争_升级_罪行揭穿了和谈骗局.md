Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Condemns U.S. Bandit Bombing of Northern Vietnam
U.S. Imperialist War "Escalation" Exposes Peace Talks as a Fraud

Hanoi, February 27 (Xinhua) - The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 26, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' artillery shelling of certain areas in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a serious act of war "escalation." The full text of the statement is as follows:

On February 22, 1967, U.S. forces used artillery stationed south of the demilitarized zone to shell several locations in the Vinh Linh district of the Vinh River and the areas south and north of the demilitarized zone. On February 24, the U.S. military command in Saigon issued a communique admitting to this incident and blatantly stating that the shelling was intended to "supplement" the bombing by aircraft.

It is clear that this is a serious new act of war "escalation" by U.S. imperialism.

The criminal actions of the United States prove that it deliberately violates the regulations concerning the temporary military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, further intensifies and expands the war of aggression against Vietnam, and grossly infringes upon the sovereignty and territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, tramples on the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue, and international law.

The serious war "escalation" by the United States further exposes the warlike and obstinate nature of the Johnson administration and further exposes its deceptive rhetoric about "peace" and "negotiations." The actions of U.S. imperialism once again brazenly provoke world public opinion, which is severely condemning it and demanding that it must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war.

The obstinate U.S. aggressors will surely meet their deserved punishment. The Vietnamese people will deepen their hatred for the U.S. bandits, further strengthen their unity, and resolutely fight to the end for a complete victory.

The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests and denounces the aforementioned war "escalation" by U.S. imperialism.

The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the U.S. government must respect the regulations concerning the temporary military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone; must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war; must withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenary forces from South Vietnam; and must allow the Vietnamese people to resolve their internal affairs themselves.

Hanoi, February 26 (Xinhua) - On February 22, U.S. invading forces in South Vietnam openly shelled several locations in the demilitarized zone and the Vinh Linh district north of the Vinh River. On February 24, the U.S. military in Saigon admitted that U.S. forces used artillery stationed in South Vietnam to shell North Vietnam and the demilitarized zone to supplement the bombing by U.S. aircraft.

    越外交部发言人谴责美国强盗炮轰越南北方地区
    美帝战争“升级”罪行揭穿了和谈骗局
    新华社河内二十七日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十六日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义炮击越南民主共和国一些地区的极其严重的战争“升级”行动。声明全文如下：
    一九六七年二月二十二日，美军使用设在非军事区南部的大炮，轰击永灵区永河乡的一些地方和非军事区南部与北部。一九六七年二月二十四日，西贡美军指挥部发表公报，招认了这一事件，并且明目张胆地说，上述炮轰“旨在补充”飞机的“空袭行动”。
    很明显，这是美帝国主义的极其严重的新的战争“升级”。
    美国的这一罪恶行动证明，它蓄意破坏关于临时军事分界线和非军事区的规定，进一步加强和扩大侵略越南的战争，极其粗暴地侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权和领土，践踏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际法。
    美国的这一严重的战争“升级”，更加暴露了约翰逊政府的好战和顽固面目，进一步揭穿了它的关于“和平”、“谈判”的一切欺骗论调。美帝国主义的这一行动，再一次对正在严厉谴责它，并且要求它必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动的世界舆论，进行明目张胆的挑衅。
    顽固的美国侵略者必将遭到应得的惩罚。越南人民将进一步加深对美国强盗的仇恨，进一步加强团结，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
    越南民主共和国外交部强烈抗议和控诉美帝国主义的上述战争“升级”。
    越南民主共和国外交部要求美国政府必须尊重关于临时军事分界线和非军事区的规定；必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动；必须把美军和帮凶军全部撤出越南南方；必须让越南人民自己解决越南的内部事务。
    新华社河内二十六日电　在越南南方的美国侵略军，二十二日公然炮击非军事区的一些地点和非军事区以北的永灵区永河乡。西贡的美国军方二十四日承认，美国军队使用了设在越南南方的大炮炮击越南北方和非军事区，以便补充美国飞机的轰炸。
