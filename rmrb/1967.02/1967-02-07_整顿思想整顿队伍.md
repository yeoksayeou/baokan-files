	Rectifying Thought and Rectifying the Ranks
	Shanghai Tongji University East Is Red Brigade

	Revolutionary rebellion is about seizing power. Revolutionary rebels must seize all the party, government, economic, and cultural powers from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line! Every inch of power must be seized, not an inch given up!

	To seize power, there must be a great alliance of proletarian revolutionary rebels. Only through the great alliance of revolutionary rebels based on Mao Zedong Thought, achieving the great alliance of the masses that Chairman Mao has long advocated, can we form a vast revolutionary army and achieve a great victory in seizing power from the bottom up.

	To achieve the great alliance of revolutionary rebels, all obstacles must be swept away. Currently, revolutionary rebels face various obstacles in the issue of great alliance. Some of these obstacles come from outside, from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. They engage in counter-revolutionary small alliances and launch counterattacks. Revolutionary rebels must be highly vigilant and promptly smash their new conspiracies.

	"You are disrupting the great alliance," say those fake rebels. This is nonsense! A great alliance must have a clear banner, it is not a hodgepodge, not a junk collection, not a compromise! You originally refused to join the revolutionary rebel organizations, then sneaked around, changed your appearance, and appeared with an ultra-leftist face, superficially "rebelling" but secretly "protecting the emperor," unwilling to surrender to the truth, secretly rejoicing at the shortcomings and errors of the rebels, and attempting to grab a straw. We absolutely will not compromise or reconcile with you in any way. "Seek unity through struggle, and unity will be preserved; seek unity through compromise, and unity will perish."

	"You are diverting the main direction of the struggle." Our main direction is absolutely correct! What is the main direction of the struggle? It is to strike at the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, to strike at the bourgeois reactionary line, to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and to establish Mao Zedong Thought! Anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will rebel against! You are in cahoots with the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, and you should be criticized and struggled against.

	Obstacles to the great alliance also come from within. Various erroneous thoughts within the revolutionary rebel ranks have become gaps for the enemy to "pull out and push in." Some leaders of rebel organizations, after seizing power, no longer hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have forgotten political power after seizing economic power, have forgotten the sharp and complex class struggle, and have forgotten their own ideological transformation. At the same time, various forms of individualism, sectarianism, splitism, compromiseism, and liberalism within the rebel ranks have already become obstacles to the further development of the revolution and to the great alliance and great seizure of power, and must be thoroughly eliminated.

	"We advocate active ideological struggle." To unite, there must be contradictions, so we must strengthen criticism and self-criticism, and struggle. Only in the great winds and waves of class struggle can a true great alliance be forged. To achieve a great alliance, we must engage in a great struggle with the class enemy and with the private thoughts in our own minds! To achieve a great alliance and great seizure of power, we must seize the power of the bourgeois command in society and the power of the bourgeois command in our own minds.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "To complete the task of defeating the enemy, we must complete the task of rectifying the party's style of work.... As long as our Communist Party's ranks are in order and our steps are unified, our soldiers are elite troops, and our weapons are good weapons, then any powerful enemy can be defeated by us." Therefore, genuine revolutionary rebel organizations and comrades must also engage in extensive study and rectification, extensively study Chairman Mao's works, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, take "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" as their guide, launch a great rectification movement within the rebel ranks, and wage a great struggle to eliminate private interests and establish public interests. We must drive out the "private" self! We must drive out all errors that go against Mao Zedong Thought! Starting from the desire for a great alliance, through struggle and rectification, we must achieve a new great alliance on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, "seeking common ground while reserving differences."

    整顿思想整顿队伍
    上海同济大学东方红兵团
    革命造反就是要夺权，革命造反派就是要把掌握在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人手中的党、政、财、文权统统夺过来！寸权必夺，寸权不让！
    要夺权，就必须有无产阶级革命造反派的大联合。只有革命造反派在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合，实现毛主席早就提出的“民众的大联合”，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，才能取得自下而上夺权的大胜利。
    要实现革命造反派的大联合，就一定要扫清各种障碍。目前，革命造反派在大联合问题上，遇到了各种阻力。这些阻力，有的来自外部，来自一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派。他们搞反革命的小联合，进行反扑。革命造反派必须引起高度警惕，及时粉碎他们的新阴谋。
    “你们破坏大联合。”那些假造反的冒牌货说。这是混帐话！大联合，就必须旗帜鲜明，绝不是大杂烩，绝不是收破烂，绝不是和稀泥！你们原先“死也不肯参加”革命造反派组织，尔后又偷偷摸摸，改头换面，以极“左”的面目出现，表面“造反”，暗中“保皇”，不肯向真理投降，看到造反派的缺点错误就窃窃私喜，妄图捞根稻草。我们绝对不和你们搞折中、调和，搞所谓“联合”。“以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡”。
    “你们转移斗争大方向。”我们的大方向正确得很！斗争的大方向是什么？就是打击党内走资本主义道路当权派，打击资产阶级反动路线，就是大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想！凡属不符合毛泽东思想的东西，我们就要造反！你们与走资本主义道路当权派打得火热，实行资产阶级反动路线，就该批判，就要斗争。
    大联合的阻力也来自于内部。革命造反派内部存在的种种错误思想，成为敌人“拉出去，打进来”的缺口。有些造反派组织的个别领导人，夺权以后就不再高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓了生产权，忘了政治权，忘记了尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，忘记了自己的思想改造。同时，造反派内部所存在的种种个人主义、宗派主义、分裂主义、折衷主义、自由主义……都已经成为革命更深入发展的障碍，成为大联合、大夺权的障碍，必须彻底扫除。
    “我们主张积极的思想斗争”。要联合就不能没有矛盾，因此，就必须要加强批评和自我批评，就要斗争。只有在阶级斗争的大风大浪中才能产生真正的大联合。要实现大联合，就定要和阶级敌人展开大搏斗，就定要与自己头脑中的私心杂念展开大搏斗！要大联合、大夺权，既要夺取社会上资产阶级司令部的权，也要夺取自己头脑中资产阶级司令部的权。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们要完成打倒敌人的任务，必须完成这个整顿党内作风的任务。……只要我们共产党的队伍是整齐的，步调是一致的，兵是精兵，武器是好武器，那末，任何强大的敌人都是能被我们打倒的。”因此，真正革命造反派的组织和同志也一定要进行大学习、大整顿，大学毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，以《关于纠正党内的错误思想》为指南，展开造反派内部的大整风，开展一场破私立公的大搏斗，要“私”字滚蛋！要一切违背毛泽东思想的错误统统滚蛋！从大联合的愿望出发，通过斗争和整顿，在马列主义、毛泽东思想的原则基础上“求同存异”，达到新的基础上的大联合。
