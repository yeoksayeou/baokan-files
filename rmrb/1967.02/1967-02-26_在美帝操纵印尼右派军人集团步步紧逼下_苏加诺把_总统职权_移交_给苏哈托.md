In the face of the U.S. imperialists' manipulation of the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, Sukarno has "transferred" his presidential powers to Suharto.

New York, February 25 (Xinhua) - Jakarta: The right-wing military clique of Suharto-Nasution, which acts as the running dogs of U.S. imperialism in Indonesia, has recently forced Sukarno to hand over his last remaining "presidential powers," further exposing its fascist and ugly face.

According to the Antara News Agency, Sukarno issued a statement on February 22, announcing that he had "transferred" his "presidential powers" to the head of the Indonesian right-wing military clique, Suharto.

The Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique, executing the counter-revolutionary military coup plan formulated by U.S. imperialism, launched a military coup in October 1965 and further seized state power by force in March of the following year, establishing a cabinet controlled by Suharto. Subsequently, it abolished Sukarno's "president-for-life" title at the puppet Temporary People's Consultative Assembly held in July and immediately formed an anti-communist cabinet headed by Suharto as the chairman of the cabinet council, abolishing Sukarno's original position as prime minister and stripping him of his leadership over the cabinet. This time, it has stripped Sukarno of his last remaining "powers," leaving him with only the empty title of "president."

Chairman Mao said: "At present, the biggest imperialist in the world is U.S. imperialism, which has its running dogs in many countries. The people supported by imperialism are precisely those despised by the broad masses of the people. Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Kishi Nobusuke, Batista, Said, and Mandeles, either have been overthrown by the people or will be overthrown by the people." The Suharto-Nasution right-wing military regime is anti-communist and anti-people domestically, and it executes a reactionary policy of being pro-American, anti-Soviet, and anti-China internationally. Now, its fascist and running dog face for the Americans has been further exposed, which will surely promote the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle against fascist tyranny.

    在美帝操纵印尼右派军人集团步步紧逼下
    苏加诺把“总统职权”“移交”给苏哈托
    新华社二十五日讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义在印尼的走狗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团，最近逼迫苏加诺交出最后一点装潢门面的“总统职权”，进一步暴露了它的法西斯狰狞面目。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，苏加诺在二十二日发表一项公告，宣布把“总统职权”“移交”给印尼右派军人集团头目苏哈托。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团，执行美帝国主义制订的反革命军事政变计划，于一九六五年十月发动军事政变，并在去年三月进一步使用武力夺取了国家政权，建立了由苏哈托控制的内阁。随后，它又在七月间举行的御用的临时人民协商会议上取消了苏加诺的“终身总统”头衔，紧接着组成由苏哈托担任内阁主席团主席的反共内阁，取消了苏加诺原来占有的总理职位，剥夺了苏加诺对内阁的领导权。这一次，它把苏加诺最后一点点“权力”也剥夺了，留下了一个“总统”的空名。
    毛主席说：“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。蒋介石、李承晚、岸信介、巴蒂斯塔、赛义德、曼德列斯之流，或者已经被人民所推翻，或者将要被人民所推翻。”苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人政权对内反共反人民，对外执行亲美联苏反华的反动政策。现在，它的法西斯面目和美国走狗的面目进一步暴露，这必将促进印尼人民反对法西斯暴政的革命斗争。
