It is essential to distinguish between proletarian leaders and bourgeois leaders, between those who support and implement the proletarian revolutionary line and those who support and implement the bourgeois reactionary line. It is incorrect to assume that all leaders should be distrusted simply because they are leaders. It is against the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong thought class perspective to oppose everything, exclude everything, and overthrow everything indiscriminately.

专栏：

    一定要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派，是拥护和执行无产阶级革命路线，还是拥护和执行资产阶级反动路线。认为只要是当权派，就一概不相信，这是不对的。不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的。
