The Soviet revisionist leadership's illegal convening of a splitist meeting to undermine Asian-African solidarity was met with resolute opposition from nearly half of the member countries.

Many Asian and African representatives firmly decided to go to the side of the great Chairman Mao to participate in the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

	Nicosia, February 19 (New China News Agency) — The so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council, illegally convened by the Soviet revisionist leadership, hastily concluded on February 16 at the American "Hilton Hotel" in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. The Soviet revisionists, in the face of strong opposition and condemnation from the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa both inside and outside the conference hall, forcibly overturned the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Winnipeg, which decided to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. This public split of the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement is a new and serious crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa.

	The entire process of this splitist conference, which was originally scheduled to last five days but ended a day early, once again fully exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership as the number one accomplice of the common enemy of the world's peoples, U.S. imperialism, as the chief culprit in sabotaging the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement, and as a commando unit of the international reactionaries who oppose great socialist China, oppose the liberation movement of the Asian and African peoples, and oppose the world revolution.

	This conference, which was planned and manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, was conducted in a chaotic atmosphere, amidst difficulties and contradictions. Nearly half of the member countries refused to participate or withdrew midway. Some delegations left before the conference was adjourned.

	From the very beginning, this illegal conference exposed its anti-China face. The five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China was not included among the national flags hanging inside and outside the conference hall. The Soviet revisionists spread a large number of rumors, slandering China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They and a small group of followers, in their private and public speeches, either openly or covertly attacked China. They even attacked those African freedom fighters who enthusiastically praised the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the seven hundred million revolutionary people of China at the conference. All these were evil schemes of the Soviet revisionist leadership to further curry favor with U.S. imperialism, sabotage and split the Asian-African people's solidarity movement, and conspire to overthrow the resolution to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year.

	This illegally convened conference had no right to discuss the location of the Fifth Conference decided by the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, on February 3, issued a statement strongly protesting the Soviet revisionists' plot to convene the so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council in Cyprus and solemnly declared: China will not participate in this anti-China splitist conference. This conference has no right to discuss the location of the Fifth Conference, and any amendment to the Winnipeg Conference resolution is illegal and absolutely invalid. The statement solemnly reaffirmed: The Chinese people will not disappoint the wishes of the Asian and African peoples, and are determined to overcome all obstacles and prepare to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year. The Asian-African solidarity organizations of Japan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaya, Ceylon, Senegal, and the nationalist organizations of Southwest Africa, Bechuanaland, Swaziland, and the Somali Coast have also issued solemn statements condemning the Soviet revisionists' plot. During the conference, representatives of the Southwest African People's Organization, the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Swaziland Progressive Party, and the Basutoland Convention Party spoke out, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples and expressing their resolute opposition to the conspiracy to change the venue. They pointed out: No conspiracy can prevent the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference from being held in Beijing this year. However, the Soviet revisionists insisted on their purpose of amending the conference venue and played one trick after another.

	In the face of the powerful opposition forces inside and outside the conference hall, the Soviet revisionists, through their followers, deliberately first proposed changing the venue to Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This plot was extremely vicious, aiming not only to overturn the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year but also to sabotage the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist group's provocative plot was seen through by many countries' representatives as soon as it was unveiled. The representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly expressed his rejection of this "proposal." After this plot failed, the Soviet revisionists adopted delaying tactics. Finally, they resorted to any means necessary and, at the "Organizing Committee" meeting on the evening of the 15th, forcibly made an illegal decision. At that meeting, which they controlled, the Soviet revisionists did not even dare to vote on the so-called change of venue. The chairman of the conference, Cypriot Lisaridis, arbitrarily announced that the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference would be changed from Beijing to Algiers, without even waiting for his words to be translated into French for the French-speaking representatives. The Soviet revisionists and a small group of their followers immediately applauded in an organized manner. The representative of Mali protested three times against this undemocratic practice. The representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Palestine, and others expressed their support for the Winnipeg resolution to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year. Lisaridis did not allow representatives from Tanzania, Congo (Brazzaville), Zambia, and many other countries to speak and arbitrarily decided: The venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference would be changed from Beijing to Algiers. This was a typical Soviet revisionist farce, lasting only about half an hour.

	This illegal conference itself was a splitist activity against the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement. During the conference, the Soviet revisionists even shamelessly staged a farce of "expelling" the Southwest African People's Organization, which supported the Winnipeg resolution to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year, from the Asian-African Solidarity Organization. They used a show of hands with twenty-five votes to announce the "expulsion" of the Southwest African People's Organization from the Asian-African Solidarity Organization. The voters, apart from the Soviet revisionists themselves, were very few. Many participants expressed great dissatisfaction with this absurd practice, considering it an unprecedented disgrace in the history of the Asian-African solidarity movement. The Soviet revisionists also forced splitist elements from Japan and Ceylon and other countries into the Asian-African Solidarity Council while refusing to admit nationalist organizations opposed to imperialism, including the Zimbabwe African National Union and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa). The Soviet revisionists dared to be so arbitrary and tyrannical, practicing fascist dictatorship in the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement, which is absolutely intolerable to all revolutionary Asian and African peoples.

	The heroic Vietnamese people, who stand at the forefront of the world's people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, have received the resolute support of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. However, what is intolerable and infuriating is that the Soviet revisionists openly used this conference, which was supposed to "support Vietnam," to carry out such a despicable plot: to split the Asian-African people's solidarity movement and thus undermine the support of the Asian and African peoples for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Soviet revisionists hypocritically "suggested" changing the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference from Beijing to Hanoi, which was such a plot. At the same time, other situations that occurred at this illegal conference can also illustrate what the Soviet revisionists' "support" means: When the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression, a Soviet revisionist actually fell asleep in his chair, and many other Soviet revisionists walked around freely and leisurely as if they were in a club. At the closing meeting of this illegal conference, which claimed to "focus on supporting Vietnam," not even a resolution on Vietnam was read. All this clearly exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionists' fake support and true betrayal, exposing their treacherous nature of trying to speculate on the Vietnam issue to gain political capital and further betray the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people.

	To carry out their unscrupulous plots, the Soviet revisionists and the conference chairman they selected, Cypriot Lisaridis, also staged a typical fascist farce at the conference. They repeatedly threatened to call the police to deal with the African freedom fighters, and when the representative of Bechuanaland and other representatives spoke out against the illegal acceptance of Japanese splitist elements to participate in the conference, they actually called the police to intimidate them. On the one hand, Lisaridis allowed Soviet and Indian representatives to speak freely and without time limits; on the other hand, he restricted anyone who opposed their erroneous line from speaking, allowing them only ten minutes, and repeatedly rudely interrupted their speeches.

	All the above farces were met with strong opposition and condemnation from the broad revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa inside and outside the conference. To protest against the Soviet revisionists' plot to change the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the illegal "expulsion" of the Southwest African People's Organization from the Asian-African Solidarity Organization, the Southwest African People's Organization, the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Swaziland Progressive Party, and the Basutoland Convention Party announced their withdrawal from this illegal conference a day before it ended.

	On that day, the representatives of these four African countries and the representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) issued a joint statement in Nicosia, strongly condemning the above crimes of the Soviet revisionists. On February 16, Mutambanengwe, the secretary in charge of external affairs of the Zimbabwe African National Union, held a press conference in Nicosia, expressing support for the just position of the above four African representatives.

	At this conference, many Asian and African countries' representatives who took a stand in support of the Winnipeg resolution and the principles of the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement bravely fought against the Soviet revisionists' high-pressure tactics. In the struggle, the invincible thought of Mao Zedong gave them great encouragement and strength. True African freedom fighters, whenever they encountered problems, would find answers in the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." After a day of intense struggle, they would gather every evening to read Chairman Mao's quotations about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers. They achieved great victories in exposing the ugly face of the traitor to the Asian-African people's anti-imperialist struggle, the Soviet revisionists. They appealed to the participants of this conference: Go to the side of the great Chairman Mao, go to the capital of revolutionary China, Beijing, to participate in the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference! When those African freedom fighters left this illegal conference and returned home, they proudly held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said to their friends: "See you in Beijing, the capital of the world's anti-imperialist fortress!"

	Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some stupid people. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of stupid people." The Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified of the great thought of Mao Zedong, terrified of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, terrified of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world rising up in revolution, and terrified of the Asian and African peoples strengthening their unity to oppose imperialism led by the United States. Therefore, they staged such an anti-China splitist conference in Nicosia. However, they only "lifted a rock to drop it on their own feet." No matter what resolution this illegal conference makes about the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, as clearly stated in the statement of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will definitely be held in Beijing this year. The conference is set! The Soviet revisionist leadership's plot in Nicosia only further exposed their traitorous ugly face. After the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement cuts out this poisonous tumor of Soviet revisionism, the true Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement against imperialism led by the United States and old and new colonialism will necessarily develop healthily along the correct revolutionary line. "A thousand sails pass by a sunken ship, and a hundred flowers bloom before a withered tree." A few buzzing flies can never block the surging tide of the Asian-African people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement. The anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples will certainly achieve new and greater victories!

    亚非人民团结反帝运动必须踢开苏修绊脚石
    苏修领导集团强行非法召开分裂亚非团结的会议遭到近半数成员国的坚决反击
    许多亚非代表坚决要到伟大的毛主席身边来参加第五届亚非人民团结大会
    新华社十九日讯　尼科西亚消息：苏联修正主义领导集团强行非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，十六日在塞浦路斯首都尼科西亚的美国“希尔顿饭店”草草收场。苏联修正主义分子在会上公然不顾亚非革命人民在会场内外表达的强烈反对和谴责，强行推翻了温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，从而公开分裂了亚非人民团结反帝运动，这是苏修领导集团对亚非革命人民犯下的新的严重罪行。
    这个原定开五天而提前一天收场的分裂会议的全部过程，再一次充分暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团是世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是破坏亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪魁祸首，是反对伟大的社会主义中国、反对亚非人民解放运动、反对世界革命的国际反动派的一支别动队。由它一手策划和操纵的这个会议是在一片混乱的气氛中，在困难重重和矛盾百出的情况下进行的。拒绝参加和中途退出这次会议的成员国将近半数。有的代表团在会议还没有闭幕就离开了。
    这个非法的会议从一开始就暴露了它的反华面目。中华人民共和国的五星红旗不包括在悬挂在会议厅内外的成员国国旗中。苏修散布了大量的谣言，诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命。他们和一小撮追随者在私下和公开的讲话中都或明或暗地攻击中国。他们甚至还攻击那些在会上热情赞扬世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和七亿革命的中国人民的非洲自由战士。所有这些都是苏修领导集团为了进一步投靠美帝国主义，破坏和分裂亚非人民团结运动、阴谋推翻关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议进行的罪恶勾当。
    这次非法召开的会议根本无权讨论第四届亚非人民团结大会决定的第五届大会地点的问题。中国亚非团结委员会早在二月三日发表声明，强烈抗议苏联修正主义者策划在塞浦路斯召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，并郑重宣布：中国决不参加这个反华的分裂会议，这次会议根本无权讨论第五届大会地点的问题，对温尼巴大会决议的任何篡改，都是非法的和绝对无效的。声明严正重申：中国人民决不辜负亚非人民的愿望，下定决心，排除一切障碍，准备于今年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会。日本、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、泰国、马来亚、锡兰、塞内加尔等国的亚非团结组织，以及西南非洲、贝专纳、斯威士兰、索马里海岸等地的民族主义组织，也都曾发表严正声明，谴责苏修的阴谋。在会议进行中，西南非洲民族联盟代表考赖萨、贝专纳人民党代表马鲁平、斯威士兰进步党代表恩科西、巴苏陀兰大会党代表马帕法尼纷纷发言，强烈谴责苏修出卖亚非人民革命事业的罪行，并表示坚决反对改变会址的阴谋。他们指出：任何阴谋都阻挡不了第五届亚非人民团结大会今年在北京召开。但是，苏修坚持其篡改大会会址的目的，玩弄了一个又一个阴谋。
    在会场内外的强大的反对力量面前，苏修通过其追随者故意先提出把会址改在越南民主共和国首都河内。这个阴谋十分恶毒，其目的不但是为了推翻第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，同时也是为了破坏中越两国人民的战斗友谊。苏修集团的这个挑衅性的阴谋一出笼就被许多国家的代表看穿了。越南民主共和国代表严正地表示拒绝这个“建议”。这个阴谋失败后，苏联修正主义者又采取了拖延的手法。最后，他们不择手段，在十五日晚的“组织委员会”会议上，强行作出了非法决定。在那次由他们一手控制的会议上，苏联修正主义者甚至不敢就所谓改变会址的问题进行投票。主持会议的塞浦路斯人李沙里迪斯专横地宣布把第五届亚非人民团结大会的会址从北京改到阿尔及尔，还没有等到把他的话为讲法语的代表译成法语时，苏联修正主义者及其一小撮追随者立即报以有组织的鼓掌。马里代表对这种不民主的做法提出了三次抗议。越南民主共和国、越南南方民族解放阵线、巴勒斯坦等代表则表示拥护关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的温尼巴决议。李沙里迪斯不让坦桑尼亚、刚果（布）、赞比亚等许多代表发言，就专横地决定：第五届亚非人民团结大会的地点从北京改到阿尔及尔。这是一出典型的苏修式的丑剧，前后共演了不过半小时。
    这次非法会议本身就是反对亚非人民团结反帝运动的分裂活动。在会议进行中，苏修还竟然无耻地导演了“开除”拥护关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的温尼巴决议的西南非洲民族联盟的丑剧。他们用二十五票的举手投票宣布把西南非洲民族联盟“开除”出亚非人民团结组织。投票的人除了苏联修正主义者自己以外，寥寥无几。许多与会者对这种荒谬的做法表示极大的不满，认为这是亚非团结运动历史上从未有过的丑事。苏联修正主义者还硬把日本和锡兰等国的分裂主义分子塞进亚非团结理事会，同时却拒绝接纳包括津巴布韦非洲民族联盟和阿扎尼亚
  （南非）泛非主义者大会等反帝民族主义组织。苏修竟敢如此专横跋扈，在亚非人民团结反帝运动中实行法西斯专政，这是一切革命的亚非人民绝对不能容忍的。
    站在世界人民反对美帝斗争前列的英雄的越南人民得到亚非革命人民的坚决支持。但是令人不能容忍和愤慨的是，苏修竟然公开地利用挂着“支持越南”招牌的这个会议来实现这样的卑鄙阴谋：分裂亚非人民团结运动，从而破坏亚非人民对越南人民抗美救国斗争的支持。苏修假惺惺地“建议”把第五届亚非人民团结大会的会址从北京改为河内，就是这样的一个阴谋。同时，这次非法会议上出现的其他一些情况也可以说明苏修的“支持”意味着什么：当越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线的代表在谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行时，一个苏联修正主义者竟然在椅子上大睡其觉，其他许多苏联修正主义者象在俱乐部里一样自由地、清闲地走来走去。在这个自称“以支持越南为主要议程”的非法会议的闭幕会议上，连关于越南的决议都没有宣读。所有这一切清楚地暴露了苏修的假支持、真出卖的真面目，暴露了他们妄图在越南问题上进行投机以捞取政治资本，从而进一步出卖越南人民的根本利益的叛徒嘴脸。
    为了推行他们的不可告人的阴谋，苏联修正主义者和他们挑选的会议主席塞浦路斯人李沙里迪斯还在会上演出了典型的法西斯丑剧。他们一再扬言要叫警察来对付非洲自由战士，而当贝专纳代表和其他代表发言反对非法接受日本分裂主义者参加会议时，他们竟然真的叫来了警察进行恫吓。李沙里迪斯一方面允许苏联和印度代表任意发言，不限时间；另一方面却限制任何反对他们的错误路线的人发言，只准他们讲十分钟，并一再蛮横地打断他们的发言。
    上述所有丑剧遭到会议内外广大亚非国家革命人民的强烈反对和谴责。为了抗议苏修策划改变第五届亚非人民团结大会会址的阴谋和抗议这次会议非法地把西南非洲民族联盟“开除”出亚非人民团结组织，西南非洲民族联盟、贝专纳人民党、斯威士兰进步党和巴苏陀兰大会党在会议收场的前一天就宣布退出了这次非法会议。
    这四个非洲国家的代表团以及阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会代表团当天在尼科西亚发表联合声明，强烈谴责苏修的上述罪行。津巴布韦非洲民族联盟负责对外事务的书记穆坦巴内格威十六日在尼科西亚举行记者招待会，表示支持上述四个非洲代表团的正义立场。
    在这次会议上，许多采取拥护温尼巴决议和亚非人民团结反帝运动原则立场的亚非国家代表，不顾苏修的高压手段，进行了英勇的斗争。在斗争中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了他们巨大的鼓舞和力量。真正的非洲自由战士每当碰到问题时，他们便从《毛主席语录》里找答案。他们经过白天一天的紧张斗争以后，每天晚上聚集在一起朗读毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎等语录。他们在揭露亚非人民反帝斗争的叛徒苏修的丑恶面目方面取得了巨大的胜利。他们向这次会议的与会者呼吁：到伟大的毛主席身边，到革命的七亿中国人民的首都北京去参加第五届亚非人民团结大会！当那些非洲自由战士退出这次非法会议之后动身回国时，他们高高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》向朋友们说：“在世界反帝堡垒的首都北京同你们再见！”
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏联修正主义领导集团对伟大的毛泽东思想害怕得要死，对中国的无产阶级文化大革命害怕得要死，对全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族起来闹革命害怕得要死，对亚非人民加强团结反对以美国为首的帝国主义害怕得要死，因此他们在尼科西亚策划了这么一个反华的分裂会议。但是他们只不过是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，不论这个非法会议作出什么关于第五届亚非人民团结大会会址的决议，正如中国亚非团结委员会的声明所明确宣布的那样，第五届亚非人民团结大会肯定今年要在北京举行。这个会开定了！苏修领导集团在尼科西亚的阴谋活动，只不过进一步暴露了他们的叛徒丑恶面目。亚非人民团结反帝运动切除了苏修这颗毒瘤之后，反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的真正的亚非人民团结反帝运动，就必然沿着正确的革命路线健康地发展。“沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春。”几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，绝对挡不住亚非人民团结反帝运动的怒潮汹涌澎湃地滚滚向前。亚非人民的反帝斗争必将取得新的更伟大的胜利！
