    Editor's Note: The great storm of the "January Revolution" is sweeping across the entire country with overwhelming momentum and extraordinary speed. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the broad masses of revolutionary rebels are "organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army" to launch a comprehensive struggle for power against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

    "The enemy will not perish of itself." A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and stubborn elements who insist on pursuing the bourgeois reactionary line, are colluding with the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, and are still trying every means to launch a counter-attack. Against these bad elements, we must fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink.

    To help the revolutionary rebels in the current struggle for great unity and great seizure of power, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to grasp Mao Zedong Thought, today we have selected a set of songs composed for Chairman Mao's quotations.

    Unite, revolutionary rebels of the proletariat! Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with the broad masses, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and strive for a complete victory in the struggle for power! (With picture)

    编者的话：伟大的“一月革命”风暴，正气势磅礴、迅猛异常地席卷着全中国。广大的无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级专政的条件下，“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了全面的夺权斗争。
    “敌人是不会自行消灭的。”一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派、坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，与社会上的地、富、反、坏、右勾结，还在千方百计地进行反夺权。对于这些坏家伙，我们一定要把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    为了帮助革命造反派在当前大联合、大夺权的斗争中，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，今天我们选登了一组为毛主席语录谱写的歌曲。
    无产阶级革命派联合起来！在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，团结广大群众，加强无产阶级专政，争取夺权斗争的彻底胜利！（附图片）
