Only the Cowardly Are Most Brutal
Doctors at the Anti-Imperialist Hospital Express Indignation and Describe the Injuries of Nine Chinese Students Studying in Europe
Strongly Condemn the Soviet Revisionist Regime's Bloody Fascist Atrocities

BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) — Nine Chinese students studying in Europe who were severely beaten by Soviet revisionist military police while paying their respects at Lenin's and Stalin's tombs are now receiving treatment at the Anti-Imperialist Hospital in Beijing under the care of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. A reporter from this news agency visited Dr. Wang Weijun, the chief physician of the neurology department at the Anti-Imperialist Hospital, who had specially traveled to Moscow to treat the injured students and is now in charge of their treatment. The reporter asked Dr. Wang to describe the injuries and treatment of the nine severely injured students.

Dr. Wang Weijun said that the day after the nine students, including Huang Jian, were admitted to the hospital, they underwent various tests, X-rays, and full-body examinations, and were also examined by doctors from various departments. The results of the examination further confirmed that the Soviet revisionist regime's bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe was an ironclad fact. Dr. Wang Weijun pointed out that the examination of the injuries and X-rays proved that the Soviet military police's beating of Chinese students was extremely brutal. The parts of the body where these nine students were injured were mostly fatal areas, such as the head, chest, and abdomen. Among them, two students had fractures, and several students suffered severe concussions. Each of the nine students had multiple injuries.

Dr. Wang Weijun said that after a consultation with orthopedic and radiology specialists, the consultation records, X-rays, and various test results have fully proven that Huang Jian's right seventh rib has a clear fracture. After several days of treatment, he still has chest pain, especially when turning over. Now, Huang Jian cannot lie flat or take deep breaths. Huang Jian not only has chest contusions and rib fractures but also has relatively severe contusions on his waist and back. Doctors are currently treating him actively.

Ma Wenpu was beaten by Soviet military police, causing him to bleed from his mouth and nose, staining his scarf, coat, and pants. After being admitted to the Anti-Imperialist Hospital, a joint consultation by ear, nose, and throat specialists and radiologists confirmed that Ma Wenpu had a comminuted fracture of both nasal bones and a collapsed right nasal bone. His waist was also severely injured. Dr. Wang Weijun said that in Moscow, Ma Wenpu's nose and eyes were severely swollen, his nose was filled with a large amount of clotted blood, and he could not get out of bed due to headaches and back pain. He is still undergoing treatment.

The other seven students also suffered severe injuries, mostly internal injuries. For example, Chen Lukuai, Liu Guanghui, Xie Shahe, Chen Fusheng, and Yan Xingshan were beaten all over their bodies. After being punched and kicked by Soviet military police in the head, waist, and abdomen, Chen Lukuai fainted three times. Liu Guanghui, Xie Shahe, and Chen Fusheng were severely beaten in the head and face, causing them to bleed from the mouth and nose and faint. Yan Xingshan suffered a concussion and, after regaining consciousness, still had abnormal neural excitement, vomiting in waves, and now still has severe insomnia and headaches. The hospital is actively treating these students to prevent any lasting effects.

The other two students, Jin Xianxiao and Li Zhencai, were both beaten multiple times by Soviet military police, resulting in severe contusions to the face, chest, waist, and lower abdomen. They still have pain in the waist and chest.

Dr. Wang Weijun said that the doctors at the Anti-Imperialist Hospital were all outraged by the Soviet revisionists' savage beating of our students. As revolutionary medical workers, we face the ironclad facts and strongly protest the Soviet revisionists' brutal persecution of our class brothers. We will spare no effort to carefully treat the students, so they can recover quickly and regain their health.

Dr. Wang Weijun said that although the nine students are severely injured, they still endure the pain to study Chairman Mao's works and relevant commentaries and documents on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said, "No matter how severe the illness, we cannot go a day without studying Chairman Mao's works. We must arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and, as soon as we recover, we will throw ourselves into the great proletarian cultural revolution. We will fight against imperialism, revisionism, and the capitalist roaders within the Party. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory." Dr. Wang Weijun said that the revolutionary spirit of these severely injured students deeply moved the revolutionary medical staff at the hospital.

    唯怯懦者最残暴
    反帝医院医生愤慨介绍九位留欧学生伤势
    强烈控诉苏修统治集团血腥的法西斯暴行
    新华社五日讯　因晋谒列宁、斯大林陵墓而遭苏修军警殴打重伤的我国九名留欧学生，在我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的关怀下，在回国以后进入首都反帝医院治疗。本社记者访问了曾专程赴莫斯科为受伤同学治疗、现在仍负责九位重伤同学治疗工作的反帝医院神经外科主治医生王维均同志，请他介绍九位重伤同学的伤势和治疗情况。
    王维均医生谈，黄建同等九位同学入院第二天，即进行了各种化验、照像和全身检查，并经各科医生进行了会诊。会诊结果更证实了苏修统治集团血腥镇压我国留欧学生的法西斯暴行是铁的事实。王维均医生指出，从伤势的检查和X线像检查证明，苏修军警对我留欧学生的殴打是十分残暴的。这九位同学被打伤的部位，大多是致命的地方，如头部、胸部、腹部等。其中两位同学被打骨折，多位同学被打成严重脑震荡。九位同学中，每一位同学身上都是多处受伤。
    王维均医生说，经过骨科和放射科专科医生的会诊，会诊纪录、X线像和各项化验检查，已充分证明黄建同同学右侧第七根肋骨后段有明确的骨折。经过几天的治疗，至今仍有胸痛，翻身转动时痛感尤重。现在黄建同同学仍不能完全平卧，不能作深呼吸动作。黄建同同学不仅胸部挫伤和肋骨骨折，而且腰、背部也受到较严重的挫伤。现在医生正积极治疗中。
    马文普同学被苏修军警打得口鼻流血，血沾染了围巾、大衣、裤子。入反帝医院后，经鼻科和放射科医生共同会诊证实，马文普同学双侧鼻骨粉碎骨折和右侧鼻骨已被打塌陷，腰部也被踢重伤。王维均医生说，在莫斯科时，马文普同学鼻子眼睛青肿得非常厉害，鼻子充满大量凝血，因头痛和腰痛不能下床活动。现仍在继续治疗。
    其他七位同学的伤势也很严重，而且大多是内伤。如陈履奎、刘光辉、谢燮禾、陈福生、阎兴山等五位同学被打全身多处受挫伤。陈履奎同学遭苏修军警拳打脚踢头部、腰部和腹部之后，曾昏迷三次。刘光辉、谢燮禾、陈福生同学被毒打头部、颜面部后口鼻流血，昏迷倒地。阎兴山同学脑震荡昏迷清醒后，仍有神经异常兴奋，阵阵呕吐，直至现在仍有严重失眠和头痛头晕。医院正为这些同学作积极治疗，尽量不使他们遗留有任何后遗症。
    另外两位同学金先孝、李振才，都是多次被苏修军警打倒在地，造成颜面部、胸部、腰部和下腹部等严重挫伤。现仍有腰部、胸部疼痛。
    王维均医生说，反帝医院的医生们在会诊中，无不对苏修如此野蛮殴打我留学生表示极大愤慨。我们革命的医务工作者，面对铁的事实，对苏修残酷迫害我们的阶级兄弟提出强烈抗议。我们一定要全力以赴，精心为同学们治疗，使他们早日痊愈，恢复健康。
    王维均医生谈到九位同学在医院的情况时说，九位同学虽然身受重伤，但仍忍着疼痛坚持学习毛主席著作，学习有关无产阶级文化大革命的社论、文件。他们说：“病再重，不能一天不学毛主席著作，我们要很好地武装自己的头脑，一待身体恢复健康，我们就投身于轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中。造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，不获全胜，决不收兵。”王维均医生说，九位伤重同学的这种革命精神，使医院革命的医护人员深受感动。
