The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered a new stage of comprehensive seizure of power. The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province have united, forming an irresistible revolutionary torrent, launching a general offensive against the handful of capitalism-roaders in the provincial committee and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. Now, the reactionary rule of these bad guys has completely collapsed. However, in the twilight of their collapse, they used such vicious counter-revolutionary economism tactics to try to save their dying fate!

The original Shanxi Provincial Committee Reception Station was a black stronghold where the provincial committee engaged in counter-revolutionary economism. The counter-revolutionary tricks they played reached an unprecedented level. Under the guise of "supporting the Cultural Revolution," they indiscriminately issued various funds, materials, and equipment, such as cars, motorcycles, bicycles, sofas, record players, telephones, broadcasting equipment, and so on. With a wave of their pen, they would issue thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan. In just the first half of January, they issued 170,000 yuan. The cultural and educational section of the reception station issued over 5,000 yuan in a single day. Under the pretext of supporting revolutionary connections, they spread a counter-revolutionary economism black wind. They reimbursed travel expenses, glasses, shoe repairs, sock repairs, clothing repairs, newspaper purchases, and everything else, truly "granting all requests" and being very "generous."

Initially, these guys wouldn't even give revolutionary masses paper for big-character posters, but now they suddenly became so generous. Why? Was it really to "support revolutionary connections"? No, absolutely not. Let's take a look at a list they issued to a certain "combat organization": "Receive three motorcycles, two amplifiers, eight bicycles, one microphone, twenty-eight horns, two microphones, five records, one record player, one generator, twenty-four transformers, three kilometers of wire, five mimeograph machines, 5,000 yuan in cash." Are these items necessary for connections? Can't we do the revolution without these things? No, absolutely not. It is clear that this is a bribe from the capitalism-roaders in power to revolutionary organizations, a batch of "sugar-coated bullets" they fired at the revolutionary masses. They used counter-revolutionary economism to sabotage the country's financial system, sabotage socialist construction, undermine the fighting spirit of the revolutionary masses, corrupt revolutionary organizations, attempt to shift the focus of struggle, and maintain their counter-revolutionary rule.

Mao Zedong Thought is a mirror that exposes demons. The broad revolutionary masses finally saw through their tricks. On January 13, under the leadership of the headquarters, we rebelled against them, took over the Provincial Committee Reception Station, and together with the revolutionary masses of the reception station, established a "Management Committee." We used one night to formulate an interim regulation for reception work, stopping this counter-revolutionary economism black wind. This rebellion was well done! This power seizure was correct!

Seizing power is a life-and-death struggle between one class overthrowing another. The revolutionary people destroyed the black stronghold where a handful of capitalism-roaders in the provincial committee engaged in counter-revolutionary economism. They will not be willing to give up. As Chairman Mao taught us: "The enemy will not disappear on its own. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not retreat from the stage of history on their own." They will certainly launch a tenfold frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary rebels, attempting to retake the ground they lost.

Sure enough, the new counterattack began. Those capitalism-roaders in power and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line used the dissatisfaction of a few backward masses, inciting some deceived people to shout slogans like "the interim regulation is 'aimed at the masses,'" "it only counts the economic accounts," "it obstructs revolutionary connections," and so on. They tried to seize on some shortcomings of the revolutionary faction to negate the correct direction of seizing power. In fact, all of these are fallacies. The power of the reception station engaging in counter-revolutionary economism should have been seized long ago! The economic accounts must be settled! Overthrowing counter-revolutionary economism is absolutely not "obstructing revolutionary connections," absolutely not "aimed at the masses"; on the contrary, it is aimed at a handful of capitalism-roaders within the party. If it is said to be "aimed at the masses," then it is aimed at the bourgeois idea of damaging public interests for personal gain among some masses. Can we stand by and do nothing while the capitalism-roaders in power use economic bribes to corrupt the masses? This rebellion was correct and well done, timely stopping the counter-revolutionary economism black hand of the capitalism-roaders in power. However, those bad guys hated the revolutionary rebels to the core. Under their instigation, the reception station was besieged and smashed multiple times.

In the face of the enemy's rampant counterattack, we did not waver at all. The power of the reception station was seized by us, the revolutionary rebels! We firmly held it! At this time, on the one hand, we humbly listened to the masses' opinions and made reasonable revisions to the interim regulation of the reception station; on the other hand, we launched a political offensive, vigorously publicizing Chairman Mao's instruction of "saving to make revolution," doing persuasive and educational work among the masses, and vigorously advocating political leadership and opposing material incentives. At the same time, we mercilessly exposed the enemy's vicious intentions of engaging in counter-revolutionary economism. Through these efforts, the deceived masses awakened, no longer wanting to receive money or items, and the expenditure of the reception station greatly decreased. Some revolutionary organizations even voluntarily returned the motorcycles, bicycles, and cash they had received. The reception station changed from its previous chaos of quarreling and fighting to being orderly. The comrades who fought with us at the reception station deeply felt: "Chairman Mao's words are truly worth a million words. Some comrades who came to receive money, after hearing our propaganda of Chairman Mao's instruction on saving, immediately expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teaching and save where possible. Some who originally wanted to receive money no longer did so."

In the process of seizing power at the reception station and the struggle to reform the reception station, we adhered to Chairman Mao's instruction of "saving to make revolution," exposed the tricks of the class enemy, revealed the enemy's ugly face, and the enemy's counter-revolutionary economism tricks completely failed.

We will continue to adhere to Chairman Mao's instruction of "saving to make revolution" with the comrades of the reception station, maintain and carry forward the proletarian revolutionary spirit, firmly hold the power, and turn the Shanxi Provincial Committee Reception Station into a truly red reception station serving the Cultural Revolution.

    遵循毛主席教导，节约闹革命
    ——记山西省委接待站夺权经过
    首都赴晋革命造反大队驻山西省委接待站全体战士
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，已经进入一个全面夺权的新阶段。山西省的广大工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部联合起来，汇成了一股不可阻挡的革命洪流，向省委一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开了总攻击。现在，这些坏家伙的反动统治已经全面崩溃了，但是，在全面崩溃的前夕，他们曾经使用了多么恶毒的反革命经济主义的手法，企图挽救他们垂死的命运啊！
    原山西省委接待站，是省委大搞反革命经济主义的黑据点。他们玩弄的反革命经济主义的鬼把戏，达到了登峰造极的地步。他们打着“支持文化大革命”的招牌，滥发各种经费、物资、设备，如汽车、摩托车、自行车、沙发、电唱机、电话机、广播器材等等。他们臭嘴一动，大笔一挥，就是几千元、几万元，仅仅一月的上半月，就发出一百七十万元。接待站的文教组一天就发出了五千多元。他们以支持革命大串连为名，大刮反革命经济主义黑风。车费报销，配眼镜报销，甚至补鞋、补袜子、补衣服、买报纸等等，统统报销，真是“有求必应”，“慷慨”得很。
    想当初这些家伙连大字报纸都不发给革命群众，如今居然一反常态，如此大方。这是为什么？是真的要“支持革命串连”吗？不，绝对不是。让我们看看这些家伙签发给某一“战斗组织”的一张清单吧：“领取摩托车三辆、扩大器两台、自行车八辆、麦克风一台、喇叭二十八个、话筒两个、唱片五张、电唱机一台、发电机一台、变压器二十四个、电线三千米、油印机五台、现金五千元”。这难道是串连必需品吗？难道缺了这些东西就不能干革命了吗？不，绝对不是。很明显，这是那些走资本主义道路的当权派对革命组织的收买书，是他们向革命群众打出的一批“糖衣炮弹”。他们用反革命经济主义的手法来破坏国家的财政金融，破坏社会主义建设，瓦解革命群众斗志，腐蚀革命组织，企图转移斗争目标，维持他们的反革命统治。
    毛泽东思想是照妖镜，广大革命群众终于识破了他们的阴谋诡计。一月十三日，我们在总指挥部领导下，造了他们的反，接管了省委接待站，并且和接待站的革命群众联合一起，成立了“管理委员会”。我们利用一夜时间，制定出了一个接待工作暂行条例，煞住了这股反革命经济主义的黑风。这个反造得好！这个权夺得对！
    夺权是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的你死我活的大搏斗。革命人民摧毁了省委一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大搞反革命经济主义的黑据点，他们是不会甘心的。正如毛主席教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”他们必然要以十倍的疯狂向革命造反派进行反扑，妄图重新夺回他们失去的阵地。
    果然，新的反扑开始了。那些走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙，利用少数落后群众的不满情绪，挑动一些受蒙蔽的人，出来大喊大叫什么暂行条例是“把矛头指向群众”，是“只算经济帐”，是“阻止革命大串连”等等。他们企图抓住革命派的某些缺点，来否定夺权的大方向。其实这些统统是谬论。接待站大搞反革命经济主义这个权早就该夺！经济帐就是要算！打倒反革命经济主义绝对不是“阻止革命大串连”，绝对不是“针对群众”；恰恰相反，是针对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。如果说“针对群众”，那也是针对一部分群众的资产阶级的损公利己思想。难道我们能眼看着走资本主义道路的当权派用经济收买的办法腐蚀群众而置之不理吗？这个反造得对，造得好，及时卡断了走资本主义道路当权派反革命经济主义的黑手。但是，那些坏家伙们对革命造反派恨之入骨。在他们的唆使下，接待站被围攻被砸事件发生多起。
    在敌人的猖狂反扑面前，我们没有任何动摇。接待站的权我们革命造反派夺定了！掌定了！这时，我们一方面虚心听取群众意见，对接待站的暂行条例进行了合理的修改；另一方面展开政治攻势，大力宣传毛主席的“节约闹革命”的指示，向群众作说服教育工作，大力宣传政治挂帅，反对物质刺激。同时毫不留情地揭露敌人大搞反革命经济主义的恶毒用心。经过这些工作，受蒙蔽的群众觉悟过来了，要领的款不领了，要领的物品也不要了，接待站的支出大大下降。有的革命组织还主动把领取的摩托车、自行车、现金纷纷退回来。接待站由原来的大吵大闹，你争我抢，变得秩序井然了。和我们共同战斗的接待站的同志深有体会地说：“毛主席的话真是一句顶一万句。有些来领款的同志听了我们宣传毛主席的节约指示，当即表示一定遵照毛主席的教导，能省就省。有的原来要领款的也不领了。”
    在接待站的夺权过程中，在改造接待站的斗争中，我们坚持了毛主席的“节约闹革命”的教导，戳穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，暴露了敌人的丑恶面目，敌人玩弄反革命经济主义的鬼把戏彻底地破产了。
    我们将和接待站的同志一起，继续遵照毛主席“节约闹革命”的教导，保持和发扬无产阶级革命精神，紧握印把子，把山西省委接待站办成一个真正为文化大革命服务的红色接待站。
