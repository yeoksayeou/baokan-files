The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will? The urgent task of a great alliance of the masses must be actively carried out!

The great alliance of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat is an inevitable trend in the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As long as we strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolutionary forces will quickly grow stronger, and we will achieve new and even greater victories.

On the issue of the great alliance, I have made the mistake of being subjective and one-sided, fearing to associate with cadres. Specifically, I have not fully recognized the role of revolutionary cadres. For example, in our school, there is a teacher who, despite being able to firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line during the movement, was not allowed to join our rebel faction. The only reason was that his family background was not good. There is a director of a teaching and research office who comes from a good background and is also a combat hero. Because he dared to expose and fight, he was labeled a "thief" by the stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line. Because he was a leader, I also feared to get close to him. Some cadres in our school who had made mistakes in history have been very active in the Cultural Revolution. The stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line use their past mistakes as an excuse to spread rumors. We were half-believing and half-doubting, and we did not dare to boldly unite with these cadres.

It was only after studying "On Rectifying Wrong Ideas in the Party" that I came to understand the serious harm of being subjective and one-sided in looking at problems. Chairman Mao teaches us to look at problems with a method that combines materialism and dialectics. In the past, we did not conduct investigations and research on some revolutionary cadres, nor did we conduct comprehensive analyses. We simply went by "assumptions" and formed some views. There are bad cadres among the cadres, but there are also good ones, and most of them are good. It is wrong to not believe in them at all, and to indiscriminately reject everything is contrary to Chairman Mao's class standpoint. After correcting our subjectivity and one-sidedness, we re-evaluated the cadres, and our views changed. At this time, we discovered that many people were truly revolutionary leftists. When we united with them, the strength of the revolutionary rebels quickly grew stronger.

    打倒主观主义，团结一切革命力量
    余桂宁
    “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”
    无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，是无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的必然趋势。只要我们不折不扣地照毛主席的指示办事，革命力量就会很快壮大起来，我们就能取得新的更伟大的胜利。
    在大联合问题上，我犯过怕沾干部边的主观片面的毛病。其具体表现是对革命干部的作用认识不足。例如，我校有个教员，尽管他在运动中能够坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，也不敢吸收他参加我们造反队，原因只有一个，就是认为他的家庭出身不好。有个教研室主任，出身很好，还是战斗英雄，由于敢于揭发，敢于斗争，被顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的当权派打成“扒手”。因为他是领导干部，我也怕和他接近。我校有些历史上曾犯过一些错误的干部，在文化大革命中表现很积极，坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子就以他们有过错误为借口，大肆散布流言蜚语。我们对这些话将信将疑，也不敢大胆地和这些干部搞联合行动。
    我学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，才认识到看问题主观片面的严重危害性。毛主席教导我们的看问题的方法，是唯物论与辩证法相结合的方法。我们过去对一些革命干部，并没有进行调查研究，也没有进行全面分析，只是凭“想当然”，就形成了一些看法。干部中有坏的，也有好的，但大多数都是好的。一概不相信是不对的，不分青红皂白，排斥一切，是违背毛主席的阶级观点的。纠正了主观片面性，重新识别干部，看法就不同了。这时，就发现许多人是真正的革命左派，我们和他们联合起来，革命造反派的力量就迅速壮大起来了。
