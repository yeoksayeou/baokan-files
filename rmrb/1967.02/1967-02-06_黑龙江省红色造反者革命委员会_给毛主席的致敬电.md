	New China News Agency, Harbin, February 4th - After the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the editorial "New Dawn in the Northeast" from the People's Daily and the news of the great alliance and power seizure rally of the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province, as well as the "First Announcement," the Heilongjiang Province Red Rebels Revolutionary Committee sent a telegram of salutation to Chairman Mao, vowing to make Heilongjiang Province a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	Dearest, Dearest, Dearest, Dearest Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	We, the Red Rebels of Heilongjiang Province, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary cadres, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary salute to you—the reddest red sun in our hearts! We wish you, dear leader, eternal life! Eternal life!! Eternal life!!!

	When we heard the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the editorial "New Dawn in the Northeast" from the People's Daily and the news of the great alliance and power seizure rally of the Red Rebels in our province, as well as the "First Announcement," we were extremely moved. This is your greatest concern, greatest support, greatest encouragement, and greatest exhortation to us Red Rebels. Millions of Red Rebels flooded the streets, cheering and singing. We shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" a thousand times, ten thousand times! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

	Dearest Chairman Mao! Following your teachings, we have achieved a great alliance of Red Rebels across the province. With the firm support of the People's Liberation Army, we have seized back the party power, political power, economic power, and cultural power that had been usurped by those in power taking the capitalist road in our province! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

	Dearest Chairman Mao! You taught us: "The seizure of national victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li." Although we have seized power, this is only the first step. The struggle is far from over. The class enemies will not readily accept their defeat and will certainly make desperate struggles, using various means to counterattack from within and without. Therefore, consolidating power has become our primary task. We will definitely heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, unite the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in our province, rely on the powerful People's Liberation Army, and resolutely counterattack any counter-revolutionary attempts by the class enemies! We will definitely implement without exception your great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, and strive for victory in both revolution and production! At the same time, we will also resolutely criticize and repudiate all elements within the revolutionary ranks that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, firmly overthrow localism, factionalism, splitism, liberalism, and individualism, purge the influence of counter-revolutionary revisionism, prevent peaceful evolution. We will arm everything with Mao Zedong Thought, command everything with Mao Zedong Thought, and turn the Red Rebel Army into a highly proletarianized, highly combative school of Mao Zedong Thought!

	Dearest Chairman Mao! We pledge to you: We will forever follow you, revolution to the end, rebel to the end. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a comprehensive class struggle in Heilongjiang Province, sweep away all harmful elements, carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and build Heilongjiang Province into a red-hot anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist stronghold! With the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, we will forge a brand new Heilongjiang Province, a brand new China, and a brand new world!

	Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Long, long live!

    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社哈尔滨四日电　中央人民广播电台广播《人民日报》社论《东北的新曙光》和黑龙江省红色造反者大联合大夺权誓师大会的消息以及《第一号通告》以后，黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会给毛主席发了一封致敬电，决心把黑龙江省办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。致敬电全文如下：最最最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们黑龙江省红色造反者、人民解放军指战员、革命群众和革命干部，向您——我们心中最红最红的红太阳，致以最最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！万寿无疆！！！
    当我们听到中央人民广播电台广播了《人民日报》社论《东北的新曙光》和我省红色造反者大联合大夺权誓师大会的消息以及《第一号通告》以后，我们心里万分激动，这是您对我们红色造反者的最大关怀、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。千千万万个红色造反者涌上街头，欢呼歌唱。我们一千遍一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！我们遵循您的教导，实行了全省红色造反派的大联合，在人民解放军的坚决支持下，把走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的我省的党权、政权、财权、文权，都夺回来了！这是以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您教导我们：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”我们虽然夺了权，但这仅仅是迈出了第一步，斗争远远没有结束。阶级敌人绝不会甘心他们的失败，必然要进行垂死挣扎，采用各种方式，从外部、内部进行疯狂的反夺权。因此，巩固政权就成了我们面临的首要任务，我们一定百倍地提高警惕，团结我省广大革命群众和广大革命干部，依靠强大的人民解放军，对阶级敌人的各种反扑，一定毫不留情地予以坚决回击！我们一定不折不扣地贯彻执行您所提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚决彻底粉碎反革命经济主义，誓夺革命生产双胜利！同时，我们也要大造革命队伍内部一切不符合毛泽东思想的反，坚决打倒本位主义、小团体主义、分裂主义、自由主义和个人主义，肃清反革命修正主义的影响，防止和平演变。用毛泽东思想来武装一切，统帅一切，把红色造反大军办成一个非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的毛泽东思想的大学校！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！我们向您宣誓：我们永远紧跟着您，革命到底，造反到底。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在黑龙江省展开全面的阶级斗争，扫除一切害人虫，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把黑龙江省建成红彤彤的反帝反修的钢铁前哨！用毛泽东思想的千钧棒打出一个全新的黑龙江省、全新的中国、全新的世界！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
                            黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会 
    一九六七年二月二日
