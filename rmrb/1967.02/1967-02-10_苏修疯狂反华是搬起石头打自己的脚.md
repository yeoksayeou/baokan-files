Arab friends have recently issued statements and declarations, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists in Moscow and Baghdad, where they brutally beat Chinese students.

In Baghdad, an Iraqi worker said, "The Soviet revisionists' savage beating of Chinese students in Moscow and Baghdad proves that they are the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and traitors to the Soviet people and all revolutionary people of the world."

Another Iraqi friend said, "All those who suppress revolutionary youth and the people will meet a bad end. The Soviet revisionist leadership will also perish."

In Damascus, a Syrian friend angrily said, "What a disgrace! The atrocities in Moscow and Baghdad show that Soviet revisionism is all bark and no bite. Their rule is very unstable, and they are very weak at heart, just as Chairman Mao said, all reactionaries are paper tigers, and so are the Soviet revisionists."

The Soviet revisionists fear China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Students from Algeria and African countries studying in Algiers expressed great indignation at the Soviet revisionists' inhuman suppression of our students in Europe. An Algerian student said, "Brezhnev is a fascist. What are the Soviet revisionists afraid of? They are afraid of China's Cultural Revolution and your influence, so they beat up unarmed Chinese students."

A Guinean female student pointed out, "The Soviet revisionist leadership is afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, but Mao Zedong Thought is the truth. People need the truth, and the truth is invincible. The Soviet revisionists can never suppress the truth!" A student from an African country said angrily, "The current Soviet government is even more cunning and vicious than when Khrushchev was in power."

The Soviet revisionists are sliding further and further down the road of revisionism

On February 7, the deputy secretary-general of the Somali Writers' Association, Abdullai Muhammad Alab, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Mogadishu, "The fact that the modern Soviet revisionists organized thugs to attack the Chinese embassy and beat up Chinese diplomatic personnel shows that they are sliding further and further down the road of modern revisionism. This fascist atrocity tells people that the Soviet Union is no longer a socialist country but is exactly like the United States imperialism."

The Soviet revisionists will meet a bad end for betraying the world's revolutionary people

On the evening of February 8, when one of the main leaders of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Kosygin, came to Britain to hold secret talks with the Labour government, the revolutionary people of Britain demonstrated in front of the Soviet embassy in London, protesting against the Soviet revisionist leadership's further collusion with imperialism, betrayal of the world's revolutionary people, and mad opposition to China.

The demonstrators' placards read, "Class struggle, not peaceful coexistence! Kosygin entertains imperialism! Mao Zedong fights imperialism!" The demonstrators issued a statement on the spot warning that the fate of the Chinese counter-revolutionary revisionists awaits Kosygin. This fate also awaits all traitors who try to stop the international working class from advancing towards socialism and communism.

    苏修疯狂反华是搬起石头打自己的脚
    苏修集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶
    阿拉伯国家朋友最近纷纷发表谈话和声明，强烈谴责苏修在莫斯科和巴格达野蛮殴打中国留学生的法西斯暴行。
    在巴格达，一位伊拉克工人说，苏联修正主义者在莫斯科和巴格达野蛮毒打中国留学生，“这恰恰证明，他们是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是苏联人民和全世界革命人民的叛徒。”
    另一位伊拉克朋友说：“凡是镇压革命青年和人民的凶手都不会有好下场的。苏联修正主义领导集团也免不了要灭亡。”
    在大马士革，一位叙利亚朋友气愤地说：“真可耻！在莫斯科和巴格达的暴行表明，苏联修正主义是外强中干的，它们的统治非常不稳，心里非常虚弱，正如毛主席所说，一切反动派都是纸老虎，苏修也是纸老虎。”
    苏修害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命
    阿尔及利亚的大学生和在阿尔及尔学习的非洲国家的留学生对苏联修正主义者丧心病狂地镇压我留欧学生的暴行表示极大的愤慨。一位阿尔及利亚的学生说：“勃列日涅夫是法西斯主义者。苏联修正主义者怕什么呢？就是怕中国的文化大革命，怕你们的影响，所以才毒打手无寸铁的中国学生。”
    一位几内亚女学生指出：“苏修领导集团害怕毛泽东思想，而毛泽东思想是真理，人民需要真理，真理是不可战胜的，苏修也绝对压不倒真理的！”一位非洲国家学生十分气愤地说：“苏联现在的政府比赫鲁晓夫当权时更狡猾，更恶毒。”
    苏修在修正主义道路上越滑越远了
    索马里作家协会副秘书长阿卜杜拉伊·穆罕默德·阿拉卜七日在摩加迪沙向新华社记者发表谈话说：“苏联现代修正主义者组织暴徒袭击中国大使馆，毒打中国外交人员，这一事实说明，他们在现代修正主义的道路上愈滑愈远了。这种法西斯暴行告诉人们，苏联不再是一个社会主义国家，而恰恰是象美帝国主义那样的国家。”
    苏修出卖世界革命人民决无好下场
    英国革命人民在苏修领导集团主要头目之一柯西金来英同工党政府密谈的时候，八日晚上在伦敦的苏联大使馆前面示威，抗议苏联修正主义领导集团进一步同帝国主义勾结，出卖世界革命人民，疯狂反对中国。
    示威者的标语牌上面写道：“要阶级斗争，不要和平共处！”“柯西金欢宴帝国主义！毛泽东同帝国主义作斗争！”
    示威者当场发表声明警告说，中国的反革命修正主义分子的下场，正等待着柯西金。这种命运也在等待着企图阻止国际工人阶级向社会主义和共产主义前进的所有叛徒。
