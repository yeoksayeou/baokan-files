	We, the soldiers participating in the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, along with the rebels from the military academies and cultural troupes, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary salute to you, the reddest sun in our hearts!

	At this critical moment of the proletarian cultural revolution, when the struggle for power is at its peak, it is you, Chairman Mao, who have issued the call to battle: The People’s Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses. Our hearts are filled with immense excitement. This is your greatest concern, support, encouragement, trust, and exhortation for us.

	Respected Chairman Mao, in the new situation of the proletarian cultural revolution, the People’s Liberation Army cannot stand by. We firmly respond to your great call, firmly execute your great directives, and firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses. We enthusiastically, unreservedly, and wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionary rebels in seizing power from the capitalist roaders within the party, allowing the proletarian revolutionary leftists to take the helm, making the sky red with Mao Zedong Thought, making the earth red with Mao Zedong Thought, making people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and making the world a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought.

	Respected Chairman Mao, we will follow your words. In this fierce class struggle, we will not compromise, we will not reconcile, and we will not remain neutral. We firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, resolutely smash the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely support the power struggle of Shanghai’s revolutionary leftists, and pledge to achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution!

	Respected Chairman Mao, we, the People’s Liberation Army, are the proletarian revolutionary army created by you. We are the most important tool of the proletarian dictatorship. In this great struggle of the proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie, we pledge to you: We will firmly follow the directives of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, keep your words in our hearts, let them flow in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We will revolutionize for life. We pledge to defend the Party Central Committee led by you with our lives, to defend you with our lives, to follow you for life in revolution, to resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary leftists, to fiercely strike down a handful of capitalist roaders, to be forever loyal to you, and to forever maintain the most brilliant color of our great People’s Liberation Army!

	We wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

    在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，是您老人家向我们发出了战斗的号召：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。我们的心情万分激动，这是您老人家对我们最大的关怀，最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，最大的信任，最大的鞭策。

    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定听您的话，在这场严峻的阶级大搏斗中，绝不搞折中，绝不搞调和，绝不搞中立。我们坚定地站在以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线这一边，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线，坚决支持上海革命左派的夺权斗争，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们人民解放军是您老人家亲手缔造的无产阶级革命军队，是无产阶级专政最重要的工具。在这场伟大的无产阶级向资产阶级夺权的斗争中，我们向您宣誓：坚决遵循林彪副主席的指示，把您的话记在心坎上，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上，干一辈子革命。誓死保卫以您为首的党中央，誓死保卫您老人家，永远跟您干一辈子革命，坚决支持无产阶级革命左派，狠狠地打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，永远忠于您，永远保持我们伟大人民解放军旗帜的最鲜红的颜色！
    衷心祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！
