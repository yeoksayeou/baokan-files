Revolutionary comrades' hearts are united, and we march forward under the red flag. Beijing Red Guards hold a grand gathering with Albanian comrades; Comrades Kaba, Balluku, Kang Sheng, and Ye Jianying attend. Comrade Balluku strongly condemns the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in suppressing our students.

BEIJING, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) — Beijing Red Guards and comrades from Albania, who are on the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, held a grand evening gathering at the Great Hall of the People tonight. The hall was brightly lit and filled with warmth, radiating the fervent atmosphere of revolutionary and combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania. The songs "The East Is Red" and "Tirana-Beijing" echoed throughout the hall.

Comrade Hysni Kapo, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, and Comrade Beqir Balluku, member of the Political Bureau and Vice Premier and Minister of Defense of the Albanian Council of Ministers, led the Albanian military delegation, including Comrade Hito Çako, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army. Comrade Behar Shytla, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, and Comrade Vasili Natanaeli, Albanian Ambassador to China, joined the Beijing Red Guards in the gathering.

Comrade Kang Sheng, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Comrade Ye Jianying, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Comrade Xiao Hua, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrade Wang Shusheng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of Defense, and other responsible comrades such as Peng Shaohui, Zhang Xianyao, Zhao Qimin, Tan Jishu, and Pan Zhenwu, joined the Albanian comrades and the Red Guards in the gathering.

When Comrade Kapo, Comrade Balluku, and others entered the hall accompanied by Comrade Kang Sheng and Comrade Ye Jianying, the Red Guards waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and enthusiastically shouted, "Mao Zedong—Enver!" "Enver—Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" The Red Guards then pinned their beloved Chairman Mao Zedong badges on the Albanian comrades and presented red armbands to Comrade Kapo, Comrade Balluku, and others, expressing their love and high respect for the heroic Albanian comrades from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle.

A representative of the Beijing Red Guards delivered a welcome speech at the gathering. He said, "Heroic Albania is a red flag flying high in the world, a soaring eagle in the boundless sky! Our two countries' peoples and youth, with their most courageous and tenacious struggles, have completely proven that the colossal imperialist United States, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are paper tigers, unable to withstand a single blow from the revolutionary people's iron fists."

He strongly condemned the recent brutal attack by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership on our students. He said, "The Chinese people, especially we revolutionary Red Guards, are not to be trifled with. Blood debts must be repaid with blood, and old and new accounts must be settled together."

He said, "The Chinese people, the revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary youth will forever be the close comrades of the Albanian people, sharing life and death, and hardship. The revolutionary Red Guards of China will forever support all revolutionary actions of the revolutionary youth of Albania."

Comrade Balluku spoke at the gathering. He warmly praised the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards and, on behalf of the Albanian people, youth, the Albanian Party of Labor, and the respected teacher and leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, extended warm greetings to the Red Guards. He said, "You are the outstanding leaders of the Chinese people, the most intimate and respected friends of the Albanian people, our most respected comrades, the Little Red Guards of the great Mao Zedong. You are the glorious representatives of the Chinese youth, the future of the great China of Mao Zedong. With your unique high revolutionary spirit and the ambition to create a new communist world, you have always held high the invincible red flag of the thought of your great leader Mao Zedong, bravely fighting in the forefront of socialist construction and socialist revolutionary struggle. You are the loyal defenders of the revolutionary line of Mao Zedong." He said, "The socialist youth of Albania, under the guidance of Comrade Enver Hoxha, are now and will always be with the glorious Chinese youth, with the revolutionary Red Guards."

Comrade Balluku introduced in his speech the revolutionary actions of the Albanian youth, who, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the respected leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, resolutely implement the Party's five great resolutions, pushing the socialist revolution forward in all fields.

Comrade Balluku strongly condemned the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in suppressing Chinese students. He said, "This clearly shows the dirty traitor's face of the Soviet leadership clique, the face of imperialist running dogs. Our youth unanimously condemn with great indignation the Soviet revisionist clique's bandit behavior, fully supporting the revolutionary Chinese students and the Red Guards of Mao Zedong."

Finally, Comrade Balluku encouraged the Red Guards to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the banner of revolution, the banner of the proletariat, and the great red banner of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, to arm themselves with the thought of Mao Zedong. He said, "It can be fully believed that in the sharp struggle for the victory of the revolutionary and communist cause, you will gloriously fulfill your mission."

Comrade Ye Jianying then spoke. He said, "The support of the Albanian comrades for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great encouragement to our people, Red Guards, workers, peasants, and students. Similarly, it is a great encouragement to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is responsible for defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and safeguarding the motherland. Now, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing vigorously and has entered a new stage."

He said, "Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only carried out according to the thought of Mao Zedong but is also personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us, 'In our country, although the socialist transformation in terms of ownership has been basically completed, and the large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved.' He said, 'Today, we are struggling to truly resolve this question of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and those who formulate the bourgeois reactionary line still have many supporters and followers in party and government organs and various organizations. To achieve the restoration of capitalism, they are using the remaining capitalist forces, even using the remaining forces of imperialism and feudalism. They openly and covertly oppose the thought of Mao Zedong and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Under these circumstances, if it were not for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally directed by Chairman Mao, this iron broom, to sweep away these counter-revolutionaries, then China's transition from socialism to capitalism through revisionism would be inevitable. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has wisely personally taken up this iron broom, initiated the brave Red Guards, and given them a fatal blow.'"

Comrade Ye Jianying said, "Chairman Mao tells us: 'It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu.' The brave workers, peasants, and Red Guards must continue to advance courageously and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We must remember the heavy sufferings of the people under the rule of the modern revisionist leadership clique in the Soviet Union. If China were to have revisionism like the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism were to succeed, thousands and tens of thousands of people would lose their heads. By carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we can avoid this great disaster and build our country into a magnificent edifice of true socialism and communism. Here, I sincerely thank the Albanian comrades for their support and praise of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

During the gathering, the Red Guards performed songs and dances praising the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong, praising the combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania, and full of revolutionary and rebellious spirit.

    巴卢库同志强烈谴责苏修集团镇压我留学生的法西斯罪行
    据新华社二日讯　首都革命红卫兵同来自反帝反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚同志们，今晚在人民大会堂举行了盛大的联欢晚会。今晚人民大会堂三楼中央大厅内灯光辉煌，热气腾腾，洋溢着中阿两国人民和两国军队之间革命的战斗友谊的热烈气氛。《东方红》、《地拉那—北京》的歌声响彻整个大厅。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记希斯尼·卡博，由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团成员，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员贝哈尔·什图拉，阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利等同首都革命红卫兵欢聚一堂。
    同阿尔巴尼亚同志们和红卫兵小将一起联欢的，有中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记、人大常委会副委员长康生，中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记、国防委员会副主席叶剑英，中共中央委员、中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华，中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声，以及有关方面负责人彭绍辉、张贤约、赵启民、谭家述、潘振武等。
    卡博同志、巴卢库同志等由康生同志、叶剑英同志等陪同步入会场时，红卫兵小将们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》热情高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”、“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”接着，红卫兵小将们把他们最心爱的我们伟大领袖毛主席像章给阿尔巴尼亚同志别在胸前，并且把红艳艳的红卫兵袖章赠送给卡博、巴卢库等同志，表达他们对来自反帝反修最前线的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友们的热爱和崇高敬意。
    首都革命红卫兵代表在晚会上致欢迎词。他说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚是耸扬在世界上的一面革命红旗，是遨游无际的山鹰！我们两国人民和青年最英勇、最顽强的斗争，完全证明了庞然大物的美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和一切反动派都统统是纸老虎，是不堪革命人民的铁拳一击的。
    他强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团最近殴打我国留学生的罪行。他说，中国人民，特别是我们革命的红卫兵战士，不是好惹的，血债要用血来还，旧账新账一齐算。
    他说，中国人民，中国革命的红卫兵和革命青年永远是阿尔巴尼亚人民同生死、共患难的亲密战友，中国革命的红卫兵永远支持阿尔巴尼亚革命青年的一切革命行动。
    巴卢库同志在会上讲话。他热烈赞扬红卫兵的革命精神，并代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、青年，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和尊敬的导师和领袖恩维尔·霍查同志向红卫兵致以热烈问候。他说，你们是中国人民杰出的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密最尊贵的朋友、我们最尊敬的同志、伟大的毛泽东的红小兵，你们是光荣的中国青年的杰出的代表，你们是毛泽东的伟大的中国的未来，你们以特有的高度的革命精神，以创造共产主义新世界的雄心，一贯高举你们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的无往而不胜的思想红旗，勇敢地战斗在社会主义建设和社会主义革命斗争的最前列。你们是毛主席的革命路线的忠诚捍卫者。他说，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚青年，在恩维尔·霍查同志的教导下，现在和将来永远同光荣的中国青年、同革命的红卫兵在一起。
    巴卢库同志在讲话中向红卫兵们介绍了阿尔巴尼亚青年按照党中央和尊敬的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的指示，坚决地贯彻执行党的五大决议，把各个领域里的社会主义革命推向前进的革命行动。
    巴卢库同志强烈谴责苏联修正主义集团镇压中国留学生的法西斯罪行。他说，这清楚地表明了苏联领导集团肮脏的叛徒嘴脸，帝国主义走狗的嘴脸。我国青年以极大的愤怒心情一致谴责苏联修正主义集团这种强盗行为，完全支持革命的中国留学生，支持毛泽东的红卫兵。
    最后，巴卢库同志勉励红卫兵要更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，革命的旗帜，无产阶级的旗帜，战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装自己。他说，完全可以相信，在为争取革命和共产主义事业的胜利的尖锐斗争中，你们将会光荣地完成自己的使命。
    叶剑英同志接着讲了话。他说，阿尔巴尼亚同志对我国无产阶级文化大革命的支持，是对我国人民、红卫兵战士、工人、农民、学生的巨大鼓舞，同样，对担负着保卫无产阶级文化大革命和捍卫祖国的光荣任务的中国人民解放军，也是极大的鼓舞。现在，我国的无产阶级文化大革命正在蓬勃发展，进入了一个新阶段。
    他说，我国的无产阶级文化大革命不仅是按照毛泽东思想进行的，而且是我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的。毛主席教导我们，“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”他说，今天，我们正在为真正解决这个无产阶级和资产阶级谁胜谁负的问题而奋斗。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和制订资产阶级反动路线的人物，在党政机构和各种组织中还有不少拥护者和追随者。为了实现资本主义复辟，他们正在利用资本主义的残余势力，甚至利用了帝国主义和封建主义的残余势力。他们用公开的和隐蔽的方式来反对毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线。在这种情况下，如果没有毛主席亲自掌握的无产阶级文化大革命这把铁扫帚，来扫除这些反革命，那么，中国从社会主义通过修正主义恢复到资本主义那将是不可避免的。我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席英明地亲自拿起这把铁扫帚，发动英勇的红卫兵，给了他们以致命的打击。
    叶剑英同志说，毛主席告诉我们：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”英勇的工人、农民和红卫兵一定要继续奋勇前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们要记住现代修正主义领导集团统治下的苏联人民遭受的沉重苦难。如果中国象苏联一样出现了修正主义，资本主义复辟获得成功，就会千百万人头落地。我们进行无产阶级文化大革命就能避免这场极大的灾难，把我国建设成伟大的、真正社会主义的、走向共产主义的辉煌的大厦。在这里，我衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚同志们对我国无产阶级文化大革命的支持和赞扬。
    联欢晚会上，红卫兵小将们表演了歌颂伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂中阿两国人民和军队战斗友谊，充满革命造反精神的歌舞。
