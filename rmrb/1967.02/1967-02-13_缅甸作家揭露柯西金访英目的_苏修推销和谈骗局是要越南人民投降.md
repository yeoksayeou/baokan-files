Burmese famous writer Du Ama on the 11th published an article in the "People's Daily" pointing out that the Soviet Union Premier Khrushchev, British Prime Minister Wilson, and the Pope and the like are eagerly helping the U.S. imperialists with the "peace talks" fraud in the Vietnam issue. Their true purpose is to make the Vietnamese people surrender to U.S. imperialism.

The article points out that those who truly want to end the Vietnam War should demand and force the U.S. aggressors to withdraw from South Vietnam. However, Khrushchev, Wilson, and the Pope and the like "have never said a word demanding that the United States and its puppet troops withdraw from Vietnam (South)." What they truly hope for is that the Vietnamese people will formally declare surrender and hand over South Vietnam to the U.S. aggressors.

The article concludes: "Those who hope to see peace in Vietnam should urge the United States to accept the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which guarantees Vietnam's independence and sovereignty, and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam."

    缅甸作家揭露柯西金访英目的
    苏修推销和谈骗局是要越南人民投降
    缅甸著名作家杜阿玛十一日在《人民报》上发表文章指出，苏联部长会议主席柯西金、英国首相威尔逊和罗马教皇之流在越南问题上起劲地帮助美帝国主义搞“和谈”骗局的真正目的，是要越南人民向美帝国主义投降。
    文章指出，凡是真正希望结束越南战争的人，都应当要求和迫使美国侵略者从越南南方滚出去。但是，柯西金、威尔逊和罗马教皇之流“却从来没有说过一句要求美国及其仆从军撤出越南（南方）的话”。他们真正希望的，是要越南人民正式宣布投降，把越南南方送给美国侵略者。
    文章最后说：“那些希望在越南看到和平的人，应当敦促美国接受确保越南独立和主权的越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。”
