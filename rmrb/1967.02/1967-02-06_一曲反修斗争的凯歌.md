Our students studying in Europe—these brave warriors against revisionism—have returned victorious. The motherland embraces you, and the people cheer for you. Your revolutionary spirit of rebellion is excellent! You are truly the good children of the motherland and the good soldiers of Chairman Mao!

Blood Spilled on Red Square

The journey of Chinese students studying in Europe back to their homeland this time was extraordinary. They encountered a storm and engaged in a fierce struggle against the violent acts of the Soviet revisionists.

On January 25, Chinese students arrived at Red Square, filled with lofty revolutionary sentiments, to lay wreaths at the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin. However, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique viewed a few dozen Chinese students holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a major threat, fearing them to the core and hating them deeply. They mobilized a large number of military police and secret agents to deal with the Chinese students. They made endless trouble, even refusing to allow the Chinese students to observe a minute of silence in front of Lenin's mausoleum. They interfered ruthlessly, not allowing the Chinese students to read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and forcibly dragging away the student who was leading the reading.

Chinese students armed with Mao Zedong Thought fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts nor spirits. They stood tall and proud, spirits soaring, holding the red book high, and read aloud:

“Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism. This is an objective law independent of man's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution is inevitable and will certainly triumph, whether sooner or later.”

They then read another passage from Chairman Mao:

“Stalin was a faithful friend of the Chinese people's liberation cause. The Chinese people's love for Stalin and friendship with the Soviet Union are genuine. No amount of slander and vilification by anyone can change this.”

The radiant red light of the red book illuminated the entire Red Square. The voice of truth from Chairman Mao shook the walls of the Kremlin, striking fear into the hearts of the Soviet military police and secret agents, who were flustered and disoriented.

When the Chinese students were reading the quotations, a Soviet army major actually stepped forward to obstruct them, pushing and pulling at the Chinese female students. The Chinese students were outraged and immediately joined hands to sing the "Internationale."

At this moment, the doors of Lenin's mausoleum were slammed shut, not allowing the Chinese students to enter and preventing the crowd from coming out. The Soviet major waved his hand, and a large number of well-trained Soviet military police and plainclothes agents who had been positioned behind the Chinese students rushed in from all directions, fists and feet flying, beating them up. These heartless fascist thugs attacked the Chinese students in groups of five or six; some used gloves with hidden metal to knock the Chinese students unconscious; some used boots with nails on the soles to kick the Chinese students' ribs, breaking them; some grabbed the female students from behind by their legs, throwing them down from a height of about one meter. The female Soviet agents who specialized in dealing with female students were particularly ferocious. They screamed while beating people, even pulling tightly on the scarves of Chinese female students, trying to strangle them.

The blood of the Chinese students was spilled on Red Square!

Although the Chinese students were unarmed, they had the most powerful weapon—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In their minds, they firmly held these words: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will press on regardless of any obstacles and difficulties, and it will never yield to the enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person left, that person will continue to fight on."

Falling down, getting back up! Scattered, regrouping! When the fascist thugs snatched away the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the Chinese students bravely snatched it back! The more the fascist thugs did not allow them to read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the louder the Chinese students read aloud; the more the fascist thugs did not allow them to sing the "Internationale," the more determined the Chinese students were to finish singing it. The fascist thugs trampled on the wreaths laid for Lenin, so the Chinese students defended Leninism even more; the fascist thugs trampled on the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," so the Chinese students defended Mao Zedong Thought even more.

"Down with the Soviet revisionists!" "Down with the fascists!" "Long live Lenin!" "Long live Stalin!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao!"

The slogans of the Chinese students echoed like thunder over Moscow, shaking the throne of the new tsars in the Kremlin.

A Struggle on the Train

The Soviet revisionists did not give up any opportunity to provoke the Chinese people. On their way back to China, the Chinese students studying in Europe experienced another struggle.

When the Chinese students were eating in the dining car of the international train, they discovered many copies of a book titled "Events in China" in Chinese and French, which slandered our great leader Chairman Mao, slandered the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, and slandered the Red Guards. They immediately lodged a strong protest with the Soviet train conductor. The Soviet train conductor was forced to agree to remove these anti-China publications. However, in the evening, they found that not only were the publications not removed, but they were placed even more prominently. The Chinese students were very angry at the Soviet revisionists' cunning tactics and lodged another strong protest. At this time, the Soviet train conductor actually threatened, "Remember, this is Soviet territory!" and said, "If you cause any more trouble, you won't be allowed to eat!" In the face of imperialism, modern revisionism, and any reactionaries, the Chinese people never back down. They firmly declared that they could go without food, but they would never allow anyone to slander our great leader Chairman Mao! They resolutely refused to eat in the dining car. With the help of Chinese train staff, they successfully spent the three days the train was in Soviet territory.

The Soviet revisionists not only harassed the Chinese students on the train but also deployed a large number of plainclothes agents along the way to monitor them. From Moscow to the Soviet border at Naushki, every station, large and small, was filled with agents, layer upon layer of blockades, as if facing a major enemy. A Chinese student said well: "These guys haven't even finished dressing up and they're already on stage. They're wearing coats on top but have police pants showing below! It's infuriating and laughable!"

The Chinese students were not intimidated by the Soviet military police and agents. On the train, they read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud over and over again: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no power that is worth being afraid of."

The Great Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Peoples

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique views the Chinese people as enemies, but the Soviet people regard the Chinese people as their closest comrades and friends. The hearts of the peoples of the two countries are close, and the Soviet revisionists, even with their fascist violence, cannot separate them.

The Chinese students will never forget that when the Soviet military police and agents were beating up the Chinese students on Red Square, many Soviet people nearby risked their lives to rush over and protect the Chinese students. Among these Soviet people, some shed tears of sympathy, some shouted, "Don't beat them!" some used their bodies to protect the Chinese students, and some linked arms to block the fascist thugs, allowing the Chinese students to leave Red Square. They will never forget that at the Moscow station, Soviet workers, despite the obstruction of the Soviet military police, voluntarily and enthusiastically helped them carry their luggage. They will never forget that when their train left the Moscow station, in an environment filled with Soviet military police, a Soviet naval soldier comrade saluted them; an elderly Soviet woman patted her chest repeatedly, expressing her heart's allegiance to China and to Chairman Mao. They will never forget that when they placed the portrait of Chairman Mao facing out the window, people at every station looked at it and showed happy smiles. They will never forget that on the train, an elderly Soviet man bravely wore the Chairman Mao badge given to him by a Chinese comrade on his chest.

From these touching examples, we can see that the great friendship between the peoples of the two countries cannot be destroyed by anyone, that the Soviet people have boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, and that there is hope for the Soviet Union, and a new dawn will rise in Lenin's hometown.

Joining the New Struggle

Our students studying in Europe have waged a victorious struggle against the Soviet revisionists. This is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought. It is being sung by the people of the entire nation and the revolutionary people of the whole world. Today, they have returned to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. They are extremely excited to see that in our great motherland, the winds and thunder roar, and the banners wave, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters a new stage. Their hearts are filled with emotion, and they are determined to join the new struggle, humbly learn from the revolutionary rebels, stand with the revolutionary rebels, and resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They will thoroughly and resolutely smash the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, resolutely uproot the roots of revisionism, and never allow the great historical retrogression in the Soviet Union to be repeated in China. They will resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely protect our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao!

### 一曲反修斗争的凯歌

    一曲反修斗争的凯歌
    我国留欧学生——英勇的反修战士们，胜利归来了。祖国拥抱你们，人民欢呼你们。你们的革命造反精神好得很！你们不愧是祖国的好儿女，毛主席的好战士！
      鲜血洒在红场上
    中国留欧学生这次回国的经历是不寻常的。他们遇到了一场暴风雨，进行了一次反对苏修暴行的激烈的斗争。
    一月二十五日，中国学生来到红场，怀着崇高的革命感情，向列宁和斯大林的陵墓献花圈。然而，苏修统治集团对几十个手捧《毛主席语录》的中国学生却如临大敌，怕得要命，恨之入骨，竟布置大批军警特务，对付中国学生。他们百般刁难，甚至中国学生在列宁墓前默哀一分钟都不允许。他们横加干涉，不准中国学生读《毛主席语录》，强行拉走领读的学生。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的中国学生，不怕天，不怕地，不怕鬼，不怕魅。他们挺胸昂首，精神抖擞，手执红色宝书，高声朗读：
      “社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    接着，他们又读了毛主席的一段话：
      “斯大林是中国人民解放事业的忠实的朋友。中国人民对于斯大林的敬爱，对于苏联的友谊，是完全出于诚意的，任何人的挑拨离间，造谣污蔑，到底都没有用处。”
    红色宝书的闪闪红光，照耀着整个红场。毛主席的真理的声音，震撼着克里姆林的宫墙，吓得苏联军警特务丧魂落魄，手忙脚乱。
    当中国学生朗读语录的时候，一名苏军少校竟上前阻挠，推拉中国女学生。中国学生十分愤慨，于是，他们又手挽着手，高唱起《国际歌》。
    这时候，列宁墓门砰然关闭，不准中国留学生进去，也不准群众出来。苏军少校将手一挥，大批训练有素的苏联军警和早已布置在中国学生身后的便衣特务，从四面八方，一拥而上，拳脚交加，大打出手。这些丧心病狂的法西斯暴徒，有的五、六个人围攻一个中国学生；有的用戴着暗藏铁器的皮手套的大手把中国学生打晕过去；有的用底上钉钉的大皮靴踢断中国学生的肋骨；有的从后面抱住女学生的小腿，把她们从约一米高的石阶上掀下来。而那些专门对付女学生的苏联女特务，更是十分凶狠。她们一边狂叫，一边打人，甚至两人拉紧一位中国女学生脖子上的围巾，恨不得把她勒死。
    中国学生的鲜血，洒在红场上！……
    中国学生虽然手无寸铁，但是有着最最强大的思想武器——战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们的脑海里牢牢印着这样一段话：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    跌倒了，爬起来！打散了，再聚拢来！法西斯暴徒把《毛主席语录》抢过去，中国学生就奋不顾身地把它夺回来！法西斯暴徒越是不让读《毛主席语录》，中国学生就越是要高声朗读；法西斯暴徒越是不让唱《国际歌》，中国学生就一定要把《国际歌》唱完。法西斯暴徒践踏了献给列宁的花圈，中国学生就更要捍卫列宁主义；法西斯暴徒践踏了《毛主席语录》，中国学生就更要捍卫毛泽东思想。
      “打倒苏修！”“打倒法西斯！”“列宁万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”中国学生的口号声，象春雷响彻莫斯科的上空，震撼了克里姆林宫里新沙皇的宝座。
          列车上一场斗争
    苏修不放弃一切机会向中国人民挑衅。中国留欧学生从莫斯科回国途中，又经历了一场斗争。
    中国学生在国际列车餐车吃饭的时候，发现餐车中摆出许多本中文和法文的名为《关于中国的事件》的反华小册子，书中诬蔑我们伟大的领袖毛主席，诬蔑我国无产阶级文化大革命，诬蔑红卫兵。他们立刻向苏联列车长提出严正抗议。苏联列车长被迫答应把这些反华书刊拿掉。可是，晚上发现，不仅没有拿掉，而且放得更多，放得更显眼。中国学生对于苏修玩弄狡猾的手法，十分气愤，他们再度提出严厉的抗议。这时，苏联列车长竟然大肆威胁说：“要知道，这是在苏联领土上！”又说什么“再胡闹就不准你们吃饭！”在帝国主义、现代修正主义和任何反动派面前，中国人民是从不示弱的。他们坚决表示，饭可以不吃，我们伟大的领袖毛主席绝不能任人诬蔑！他们坚决不再吃餐车上的饭。在中国列车员的协助下，他们胜利地度过了列车在苏联境内行驶的三天。
    苏修不仅在列车上对中国留学生刁难，而且沿途布置大批便衣特务，进行监视。从莫斯科到苏联边境的纳乌斯基，大小车站，特务密布，层层封锁，如临大敌。一位中国学生说得好：“这些家伙还没打扮好就出场了。上身穿的是大衣，下身却露出了警裤！真是可气又可笑！”
    中国留学生并没有被苏联的军警特务吓倒。他们在列车上一遍又一遍地高声朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”
      中苏人民的伟大友谊
    苏修统治集团把中国人民视为仇敌，苏联人民却把中国人民看成是最亲密的同志和朋友。中苏两国人民心贴着心，苏修即使用法西斯暴力，也不能把他们分开。
    中国学生永远不会忘记，当苏联军警特务在红场上对中国学生大打出手的时候，红场附近的许多苏联人民，冒着生命的危险，跑过来保护中国学生。这些苏联人中间，有的落下了同情的热泪，有的高喊“不准打人！”有的用身体保护中国学生，有的手挽手挡住法西斯暴徒，让中国学生走出红场。他们永远不会忘记，在莫斯科车站上，苏联工人不顾苏联军警的阻挠，主动地、热情地为他们运送行李。他们永远不会忘记，当他们乘坐的列车离开莫斯科车站的时候，在苏联军警密布的环境里，一位苏联海军士兵同志，向他们举手致敬；一位苏联老太太，用手连连拍着胸口，表示心向中国，心向毛主席。他们永远不会忘记，当他们把毛主席像贴着车窗朝外放着的时候，每个车站都有人注视，并且露出幸福的微笑。他们永远不会忘记，在列车上，一位苏联老人，把中国同志送给他的毛主席像章勇敢地戴在胸前。……
    从这些感人的事例中，我们不仅可以看到任何人也破坏不了的中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，可以看到苏联人民对毛主席的无限热爱、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱，而且可以看到苏联的希望，望见将要在列宁故乡升起的新的曙光。
        投入新的斗争中去
    我国留欧学生进行了一场反对苏修的胜利的斗争。这是又一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。它在全国人民和全世界革命人民中间传诵着。今天，他们已经回到了伟大领袖毛主席身边。他们无比兴奋地看到，在我们伟大祖国的土地上，风雷动，旌旗奋，无产阶级文化大革命进入了新的阶段。他们的心情万分激动，决心投入新的斗争中去，虚心向革命造反派学习，同革命造反派站在一起，誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决地、彻底地粉碎资产阶级反动路线，誓死把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，坚决挖掉修正主义的根子，绝不允许苏联的历史大倒退在中国重演，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！
