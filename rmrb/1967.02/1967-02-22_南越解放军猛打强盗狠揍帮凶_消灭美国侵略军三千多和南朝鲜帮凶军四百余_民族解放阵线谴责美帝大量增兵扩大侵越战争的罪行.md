The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has fiercely attacked bandits and severely punished accomplices, annihilating over 3,000 American aggressor troops and more than 400 South Korean mercenary troops. The National Liberation Front condemns the U.S. imperialists for their crimes of increasing troops and expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam.

According to a supplementary report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, from January 2 to 29, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation forces in the provinces of Tuyen Duc and Gia Dinh, in the battle to thwart a major "sweep" by American bandits, annihilated 3,163 enemy troops, almost all of whom were American aggressors. Additionally, they destroyed or damaged 204 military vehicles and shot down 28 enemy aircraft.

The report states that in the various communes of the border areas of Tuyen Duc Province, the liberation armed forces conducted over 270 battles, killing and wounding 2,663 enemy troops, including 2,627 American aggressors and mercenary troops. They destroyed or damaged 103 tanks and amphibious armored vehicles and four other military vehicles, and shot down 15 enemy aircraft.

In the northern communes of the Gia Dinh Province, the liberation armed forces annihilated over 500 American aggressor troops, destroyed or damaged 97 various military vehicles, and shot down 13 enemy aircraft.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency and the Liberation Radio, the liberation armed forces in the Quang Ngai Province have recently been frequently attacking, annihilating a large number of American aggressors, South Korean mercenary troops, and South Vietnamese puppet troops.

From January 25 to February 1, the local forces and guerrilla units of the De Phu County conducted continuous ambushes against two battalions of American marines sweeping through the Phu Ninh Commune, annihilating over 600 enemy troops, shooting down eight enemy aircraft, destroying four bunkers, ten fortifications, and 23 tents, and seizing a large amount of weapons.

On the morning of February 15, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce assault on the Quang Ngai City, only 11 kilometers away from the Son My County Son Kim Commune, almost completely annihilating a battalion of South Korean mercenary troops stationed there.

In this brave and clever assault, after a volley of accurate artillery fire, the liberation armed forces divided into several groups and bravely infiltrated the enemy's positions from different directions, engaging in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The enemy was terrified and their bodies lay scattered, making it impossible for enemy aircraft to provide rescue. After two hours of battle, the liberation armed forces, after repelling the enemy's multiple counterattacks, killed and wounded 420 South Korean mercenary troops.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Central Committee of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's External Liaison Committee issued a statement on February 10, strongly condemning the U.S. government for continuing to send troops to South Vietnam and transport war materials, expanding the war of aggression.

The statement said that on January 30 and February 2 alone, the U.S. government sent 7,200 American combat troops to South Vietnam, increasing the total number of U.S. troops in Vietnam to around 410,000. On February 10, the U.S. dispatched more than 1,000 sorties of aircraft to transport war materials to their troops in South Vietnam.
