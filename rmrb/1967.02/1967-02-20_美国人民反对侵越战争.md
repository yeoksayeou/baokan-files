The American people are using various means to protest and condemn the Johnson administration's aggressive war in Vietnam.

	Kneel, Defense Department Officials!
	According to Western news agencies, 2,500 American women demonstrated in front of the office building of U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara on the 15th, protesting the U.S. invasion of Vietnam. They chanted slogans and rushed towards the doors of the Pentagon. They angrily pointed at the Defense Department officials standing on the steps of the building and shouted, "Make them kneel and repent!" The demonstration lasted for an hour and a half.

	Protest Against Goldberg
	More than a thousand students and lecturers from Harvard University strongly opposed U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg's speech on the 12th, in which he defended the Johnson administration's policy of invading Vietnam. Goldberg's two-hour-long speech was repeatedly interrupted by boos and laughter from the audience. To deal with the students' opposition, Harvard University was heavily guarded that night, and Goldberg sneaked into the venue through the back door under the protection of guards.

	Religious Figures Launch Hunger Strike
	Approximately 2,000 Christians, Catholics, and Jews from 45 states in the U.S. demonstrated in front of the White House on January 31, protesting the U.S. invasion of Vietnam. These religious figures also began a three-day hunger strike in various parts of the U.S. starting from February 8, opposing the Johnson administration's war of aggression in Vietnam.

	Hosting "Angry Art Week"
	Hundreds of artists in New York City held the "Angry Art Week" at the end of January and beginning of February, showcasing and performing films, plays, paintings, and sculptures that protest the U.S. invasion of Vietnam.

	Five thousand American scientists recently signed a petition opposing the use of chemical and biological weapons by American imperialists on the battlefield in Vietnam.
