The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary army of the proletariat personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, and it is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will vanquish all enemies and will never be subdued by them." In the domestic wars, it climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands, writing the magnificent epic of the 25,000-li Long March that shook the world; in the War of Resistance Against Japan, it defeated the ferocious Japanese imperialists with rifles and rice; in the War of Liberation, it fought valiantly, defeating the Kuomintang bandits' hundreds of thousands of troops, and liberated all of China; then it fought alongside the Korean people to defeat the American imperialists who were armed to the teeth. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has established immortal achievements for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a model of high-held Mao Zedong Thought and the active application of Chairman Mao's works.

"The gun is the key to political power." The political power of our proletariat was won by the PLA with guns, and the political power of our proletariat is defended by the strong PLA with guns. "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." With the Communist Party, with the PLA led by the Communist Party, we have political power, we have everything. Without the Communist Party, without the PLA led by the Communist Party, there is no political power, there is nothing. The PLA, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, is the most reliable force for seizing and defending the political power of the proletariat.

"The People's Liberation Army will always be a fighting force. Even after national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and imperialism exists internationally, our army will still be a fighting force. There must be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point." Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered a new stage. The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat are carrying out great unity, concentrating their forces to launch a comprehensive struggle for power against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and a small number of stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. At this crucial moment of the fierce class struggle, our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao has issued a call to the entire PLA to actively support the broad masses of the left. The entire PLA, officers and soldiers, have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, vowing to be the strong backbone of the revolutionary left. They have followed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, with a firm stance, a clear banner, and resolute actions, enthusiastically supporting the revolutionary left of the proletariat, supporting the revolutionary left in carrying out great unity and launching a comprehensive struggle for power, and participating in this great unity and great struggle for power, making new contributions to the people and establishing new achievements. We warmly applaud, we salute the glorious and great Chinese People's Liberation Army!

The enemy is not willing to perish. The strong support of the PLA for the great unity and great struggle for power of the revolutionary left has made the enemy panic-stricken and trembling with fear. A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, a small number of stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, and all the ghosts and monsters have joined forces, using the tactic of "infiltrating and expelling" to sneak into the revolutionary ranks, colluding with some degenerate elements who have usurped leadership positions in certain mass organizations, deceiving and inciting revolutionary students, workers, and masses, slandering and attacking the PLA, directing their spearheads at the PLA, attempting to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution."

All comrades of the revolutionary rebels, you must highly raise your vigilance, see through the enemy's tricks, and do not be fooled by them. In this acute and complex class struggle, we must keep our eyes open, distinguish between enemies and friends, grasp the general direction of the struggle, firmly support all revolutionary actions of the PLA, and expose the small handful of scoundrels who incite the masses to insult, attack, and beat the PLA officers and soldiers, and expose the small handful of scoundrels who sabotage the great unity of the revolutionary left. We warn those scoundrels: No matter how many tricks and disguises you have, you cannot escape the sharp eyes of the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and you cannot escape the iron grip of the great unity of the revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

Do not oppose the People's Liberation Army! Whoever opposes the People's Liberation Army personally founded by Chairman Mao is opposing our great leader Chairman Mao! Whoever opposes the People's Liberation Army is a counter-revolutionary! Whoever opposes the People's Liberation Army, we will resolutely smash them to pieces, making them never able to rise again!

Unite, revolutionary rebels of the proletariat! Unite, revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and the People's Liberation Army! Defeat the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and seize power from the bourgeoisie comprehensively!

    向在夺权斗争中建立新功勋的人民解放军致敬
    王效禹　孙枫丹
    中国人民解放军，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的无产阶级的革命军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。
  “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”在国内战争中，爬雪山、过草地，写下了震动天下的两万五千里长征的壮丽史诗；在抗日战争中，用小米加步枪打败了凶恶的日本帝国主义；在解放战争中，浴血奋战，打垮了蒋匪帮的几百万军队，解放了全中国；接着又和朝鲜人民一起打败了武装到牙齿的美帝国主义。中国人民解放军，为中国人民和世界人民的革命事业建立了不朽的功勋。中国人民解放军是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的典范。
      “枪杆子里面出政权”。我们无产阶级的政权就是解放军用枪杆子打出来的，我们无产阶级的政权就是依靠强大的解放军用枪杆子来捍卫。“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”我们有了共产党，有了共产党领导下的人民解放军，就有了政权，就有了一切。没有共产党，没有共产党所领导的人民解放军，就没有政权，就没有一切。无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军，就是夺取和捍卫无产阶级政权的最可靠的力量。
      “人民解放军永远是一个战斗队。就是在全国胜利以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。”现在，我国无产阶级文化大革命已进入了一个新阶段，无产阶级革命造反派实行大联合，集中力量向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开全面夺权斗争。在这场严峻的阶级大搏斗的关键时刻，我们的伟大统帅毛主席向人民解放军全军发出了应该积极支持左派广大群众的战斗号召。人民解放军全体指战员热烈响应毛主席这一伟大号召，誓作革命左派的坚强后盾。他们遵照林彪同志的指示，以坚定的立场，鲜明的旗帜，果敢的行动，热烈地支持无产阶级革命左派，支持革命左派实行大联合，展开全面的夺权斗争，并参加了这个大联合、大夺权的斗争，为人民作出了新的贡献，建立了新的功勋。我们热烈欢呼，我们向光荣的伟大的中国人民解放军致敬！
    敌人是不甘心灭亡的。人民解放军对革命左派大联合、大夺权的强大支持，使敌人失魂落魄，胆战心惊。一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、极少数执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子和一切牛鬼蛇神，纠合一起，用打进来拉出去的办法，钻进革命队伍，和一些蜕化了的窃踞某些群众组织领导地位的上层分子勾结起来，蒙蔽和挑动革命学生、工人、群众，诬蔑和围攻人民解放军，把矛头指向人民解放军，企图反对无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
      “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
      “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    一切革命造反派的同志们，要高度地提高警惕，识破敌人的阴谋诡计，不要上他们的当。我们要在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，擦亮眼睛，分清敌友，把握斗争的大方向，坚决拥护人民解放军的一切革命行动，把挑动群众谩骂、围攻解放军和殴打解放军指战员的一小撮坏蛋揪出来，把破坏革命左派大联合的一小撮坏蛋揪出来。我们警告那些坏蛋们：任凭你们有十八般武艺和七十二变，都逃脱不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众的火眼金睛，都逃不出用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派大联合的铁掌！
    不准反对人民解放军！谁反对毛主席亲自缔造的人民解放军，谁就是反对我们伟大领袖毛主席！谁反对人民解放军，谁就是反革命！谁反对人民解放军，我们就坚决把他砸个稀巴烂，叫他永世不得翻身！
    无产阶级革命造反派联合起来！无产阶级革命造反派和人民解放军团结起来！打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，向资产阶级实行全面夺权！
