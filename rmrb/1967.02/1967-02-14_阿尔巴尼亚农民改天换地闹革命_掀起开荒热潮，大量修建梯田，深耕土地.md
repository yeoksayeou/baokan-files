Inspired by the spirit of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian people have successfully completed the first half of the 1966-1967 plan for land reclamation. According to statistics from the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture, in the first half of this plan year, the country has completed 66% of the annual plan.

Recognizing that achieving grain self-sufficiency is a major strategic issue, the broad masses of peasants and agricultural workers have thrown themselves into the land reclamation movement with high revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. The districts of Kruja, Skrapar, and all state farms across the country have completed their land reclamation plans. The peasants in the mountainous areas of Gramsh have launched a winter land reclamation campaign, overcoming various difficulties to complete 77% of the annual land reclamation plan. Many cooperatives in the districts of Korça and Tepelena have also completed their land reclamation plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets.

While actively engaging in land reclamation, various regions have also built a large number of terraces, deep plowed the land, and actively carried out fertilizer accumulation activities. According to statistics, in these six months, the country has built 8,000 hectares of terraces, deep plowed 69,044 hectares of land, laying a solid foundation for the spring sowing.

    阿尔巴尼亚农民改天换地闹革命
    掀起开荒热潮，大量修建梯田，深耕土地
    新华社地拉那电　在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会精神鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚人民胜利地完成了一九六六——一九六七年度前六个月的开荒计划。据阿尔巴尼亚农业部统计，在这计划年度的前六个月中，全国完成了年度计划的百分之六十六。
    由于广大农民和农业工人认识到争取粮食自给是具有重大战略意义的政治问题，他们以饱满的革命精神和高度的劳动热情投入了开荒运动。克鲁亚、斯克拉巴里等区以及全国各国营农场都完成了开荒计划。格拉姆什区山区的农民掀起冬季开荒热潮，克服种种困难，完成了年度开荒计划的百分之七十七。科尔察、台佩莱纳等区的许多合作社也提前超额完成了开荒计划。
    各地在积极开荒的同时，还大量修建梯田，深耕土地和积极开展积肥活动。据统计，在这六个月中，全国共修建了八千公顷梯田，深耕土地六万九千零四十四公顷，为春播打下了良好的基础。
