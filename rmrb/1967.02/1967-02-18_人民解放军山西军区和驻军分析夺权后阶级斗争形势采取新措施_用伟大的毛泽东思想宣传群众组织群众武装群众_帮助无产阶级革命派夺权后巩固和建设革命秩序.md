The People's Liberation Army Shaanxi Military Region and stationed troops, after supporting the Shaanxi Province proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power, have, in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses. They have promoted the ideological revolution of the revolutionary rebel factions, helped the proletarian revolutionary factions to consolidate and build the revolutionary order, and safeguarded the great victory of the struggle to seize power.

The People's Army Resolutely Carries Out Chairman Mao's Instructions

The flag is clear, the stance is firm, support the left, strike the right

After the Shaanxi proletarian revolutionary factions seized power on January 12, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rapidly presented a new and excellent situation. Revolutionary forces are becoming increasingly powerful, anti-revolutionary forces are becoming increasingly weak, and the proletarian revolutionary factions are advancing along the road to victory. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are unwilling to accept their defeat. They are playing various tricks, organizing new counterattacks, and attempting to seize back the power they have lost from the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The People's Liberation Army Shaanxi Military Region and stationed troops have analyzed the class struggle situation after seizing power, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Red Army is not merely a fighting force; in addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it must also undertake the important tasks of propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power, and even building the organization of the Communist Party." They have realized that after supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power from the capitalist-roaders, there is still much important work to be done. First of all, we must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the proletarian revolutionary factions, help the masses to consolidate and build the revolutionary order, and thus truly carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The troops have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and based on the actual situation in Shaanxi, in addition to dispatching troops to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, take over or protect propaganda, public security, judicial, industrial and mining enterprises, transportation hubs and other important departments, also sent many political workers to the front lines of the struggle to help the proletarian revolutionary factions consolidate and build the revolutionary order.

Helping the Revolutionary Factions to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works

Breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness to promote ideological construction and further advance the great unity

The soldiers first of all emphasized helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to carry out a thorough revolution in their souls, to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, to sweep away all obstacles to consolidating and building the revolutionary order, and to establish the idea of holding power for the proletarian revolutionary cause. After the victory of the struggle to seize power, some people in the proletarian revolutionary factions developed small-groupism, factionalism, and individualism, which affected the great unity. The soldiers, after analysis and study, realized that these erroneous ideas were ultimately due to the "self" in their minds. Therefore, the soldiers sent out one propaganda vehicle after another to factories, schools, offices, and streets, widely propagating Chairman Mao's relevant quotations, and together with the proletarian revolutionary factions studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the article "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, learning and applying what they had learned, uprooting factionalism, small-groupism, and individualism. The proletarian revolutionary factions, after studying, said: "Seizing power is not for the sake of fame and wealth, not for the sake of promotion and enrichment, but for the sake of defending Chairman Mao and building a red communist new world." They became even more active and energetic in realizing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. A certain factory where a certain company of the Shaanxi Military Region is stationed, the proletarian revolutionary faction organization "Torch Fighting Corps" is a large organization. After seizing power, they united with other brother revolutionary organizations to establish the factory revolutionary rebel headquarters. During the organizational construction, a few people in the "Torch Fighting Corps" had the idea of "putting myself first" and the "large corps" thought, believing that the headquarters should be led by the "Torch Fighting Corps." After the company political instructor Zhang discovered this problem, he studied the article "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" with the revolutionary rebels. The comrades of the "Torch Fighting Corps" raised their consciousness after studying and said: "Putting small-group interests first is bourgeois ideology. We, the working class, want to be true proletarian revolutionaries, we must put revolutionary interests first and resolutely overcome parochialism." They actively proposed that whoever holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought should be elected to the leadership positions of the headquarters. Other revolutionary organizations responded enthusiastically, and after full discussion, they elected the true proletarian revolutionaries who resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions, had a firm stance, and were brave in struggle to the leadership positions of the headquarters, forming a strong leadership core. From then on, everyone was more united, and more than ten revolutionary organizations joined the headquarters.

Helping the Revolutionary Factions to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works

Conducting class analysis of leading cadres to better implement the "three-in-one" combination

Helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to distinguish between enemies and friends, to unite with revolutionary leading cadres, and to better implement the "three-in-one" combination. In the struggle to seize power, many revolutionary leading cadres actively stood on the correct line of Chairman Mao, stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, and fought against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. However, some proletarian revolutionary factions did not resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's cadre policy, believing that as long as they were in power, they could not be trusted, not distinguishing between right and wrong, kicking them all away, and knocking them all down; some treated revolutionary leading cadres as "informed persons," only letting them expose some problems, and did not give full play to their roles. The soldiers realized that this was not conducive to strengthening the revolutionary forces, not conducive to isolating and concentrating forces to strike at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fortresses of the class enemies. The soldiers, together with revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." They studied the editorial of the third issue of the journal "Red Flag" titled "On the Struggle of the Proletarian Revolutionary Factions to Seize Power." The responsible comrades of the military region also helped the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters to summarize the successful experiences of the "three-in-one" combination of revolutionary rebels, revolutionary leading cadres, and the People's Liberation Army in the struggle to seize power.

After studying, the broad proletarian rebel factions realized that in dealing with leading cadres, they should conduct class analysis, not only seeing their momentary actions but also seeing their entire history and work. For cadres who made some mistakes in the movement, they should adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," helping them to correct their mistakes and allowing them to make a revolution. This is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching. The practice of negating leading cadres without analysis is not in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. After raising their consciousness, the broad revolutionary workers, students, and cadres used the method of class analysis to deal with leading cadres. They united with and combined with those leading cadres who supported Chairman Mao and carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; they firmly fought against and struck at those who were anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought and who insisted on not changing and were incorrigible. The Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the Taiyuan Revolutionary Rebel Command, and many factories, offices, and schools' proletarian revolutionary factions all absorbed revolutionary leading cadres from their units to participate in the leadership work. A section chief of the Xishan Mining Bureau, in the movement, fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary factions, exposing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in the mining bureau. The revolutionary masses gave him a red armband of the proletarian revolutionary organization "Mine Flame." A part of the revolutionary leading cadres of the Taiyuan Textile Factory, in the past, worked wholeheartedly for the Party, and during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they always supported the proletarian revolutionary factions. After the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power, they were elected into the revolutionary production committee to continue leading production. The proletarian revolutionary factions felt in practice that uniting with revolutionary leading cadres had four advantages: first, it strengthened the forces of the proletarian revolutionary factions; second, it isolated and struck at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; third, it helped to speed up the consolidation and construction work after seizing power; fourth, it was conducive to "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and could quickly establish a new production order.

Helping the Revolutionary Factions to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works

Launching political offensives to disintegrate rightist organizations, uniting the middle forces to strengthen the revolutionary forces

Helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, launching political offensives, disintegrating and disintegrating rightist organizations, educating the deceived masses to awaken, and strengthening the revolutionary forces. The "Red Guards" organization of the Taiyuan Textile Factory was manipulated by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and did many bad things. However, the majority of the masses in the "Red Guards" were deceived. After the revolutionary faction "Red Guard Corps" seized power, some people ridiculed and mocked the deceived masses in the "Red Guards." As a result, the antagonistic sentiments between some masses in the "Red Guards" and the "Red Guard Corps" became more serious. Some leading comrades of the Shaanxi Military Region headquarters had a night-long talk with the responsible persons of the "Red Guard Corps," persuading everyone not to replace policy with emotion. After patient persuasion, the consciousness of the "Red Guard Corps" members was greatly raised. On the one hand, they wrote big-character posters and held material exhibitions to expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory; on the other hand, they sincerely talked with the deceived masses in the "Red Guards," patiently helping them. Many deceived masses saw through the reactionary faces of the villains, realized that they had stood on the wrong side, and stood up one after another to rebel against the capitalist-roaders, and announced their withdrawal from the "Red Guards" manipulated by the villains, joining the "Red Guard Corps." For some destructive activities of reactionary organizations and counter-revolutionary elements, the troops took resolute suppression.

After a period of hard and painstaking work in propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses, the forces of the Shaanxi proletarian revolutionary factions have developed and grown stronger, and the work of consolidating and building the revolutionary order has achieved great results. Recently, the Shaanxi Military Region and stationed troops have initially summarized the experiences of supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions. They felt that to do a good job in helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to consolidate and build the revolutionary order, they must: first, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with a firm stance and a clear flag, resolutely support the left, strike the right, and be the strong rear guard of the proletarian revolutionary factions; second, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, helping the proletarian revolutionary factions, while seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, to seriously reform their non-proletarian world outlook and seize the power of the "self" in their minds. In this way, they can build the proletarian revolutionary factions into a highly proletarianized and highly combatant revolutionary force; third, the troops must become a mass work team, revolutionizing together with the masses, learning from each other, helping each other, and carrying out thorough and detailed ideological and political work. And with the revolutionary left as the core, uniting the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to the greatest extent, isolate and strike at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. On the basis of summarizing experiences, the People's Liberation Army Shaanxi Military Region and stationed troops continue to take new measures, dispatching a large number of excellent soldiers and officers to factories, schools, and offices to do mass work, further helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to consolidate and build the revolutionary order, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    人民解放军山西军区和驻军分析夺权后阶级斗争形势采取新措施
    用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众组织群众武装群众
    帮助无产阶级革命派夺权后巩固和建设革命秩序
    新华社太原十七日电　中国人民解放军山西省军区、驻山西部队在支持山西省无产阶级革命派夺权以后，按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，发扬彻底革命的精神，用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，促进革命造反派的思想革命化，帮助无产阶级革命派进行巩固和建设工作，保卫伟大的夺权斗争的胜利果实。
    人民军队坚决执行毛主席的指示
    旗帜鲜明　立场坚定  支持左派　打击右派
    山西无产阶级革命派在一月十二日夺权以后，无产阶级文化大革命迅速出现了一个崭新的大好形势，革命的力量越来越壮大，反对革命的势力越来越削弱，无产阶级革命派正沿着胜利的道路前进。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心于他们的失败，玩弄种种阴谋，组织新的反扑，妄图从无产阶级革命派手里夺回失去的大权。中国人民解放军山西省军区、驻山西部队分析了夺权后的阶级斗争形势，学习了毛主席的教导：“红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务”，认识到我们支持无产阶级革命派从走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权以后，还有许多重大的工作要做，首先就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派头脑，帮助群众巩固和建设革命秩序，这样才能真正把文化大革命进行到底。部队指战员按照毛主席的指示，根据山西的实际情况，除出动部队坚决镇压反革命活动、接管或保护宣传、公安、政法机构，工矿企业，交通枢纽等重要部门外，还派出许多政治工作人员到斗争的前线，帮助无产阶级革命派巩固和建设革命秩序。
    帮助革命派活学活用毛主席著作
    破私立公进行思想建设  进一步推动大联合大团结
    指战员们首先突出帮助无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，在灵魂深处大闹革命，打掉私字，树立公字，以毛泽东思想为指针，扫清巩固、建设革命秩序的种种障碍，树立为无产阶级革命事业掌权的思想。夺权斗争胜利后，无产阶级革命派队伍中，有些人产生了小团体主义、山头主义、个人主义思想，影响着大联合、大团结。部队指战员经过分析研究，认识到这种种错误思想，归根到底都是头脑里的私字在作怪。于是，指战员们开出一辆辆宣传车，到工厂、学校、机关、街头，广泛进行宣传，广播毛主席的有关语录，和无产阶级革命派一起学习“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等文章，大破私心，大立公心，学了就用，挖掉山头主义、小团体主义、个人主义的根子。无产阶级革命派经过学习说：“夺权不是为了争名夺利，不是为了升官发财，而是为了保卫毛主席，为了建设红彤彤的共产主义新世界。”他们更加积极努力地实现无产阶级革命派大联合，壮大无产阶级革命派队伍。山西省军区某连所驻的某工厂，无产阶级革命派组织“烽火战斗兵团”是个大组织，他们夺权后，和其他兄弟革命组织联合成立了工厂革命造反总指挥部。进行组织建设时，“烽火战斗兵团”少数人有“以我为主”的“大兵团”思想，认为总指挥部应以“烽火战斗兵团”为主。某连指导员原小崇发现这个问题后，就和革命造反派一起学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》。“烽火战斗兵团”的同志经过学习，思想大大提高，说：“把小团体利益放在前面，这是资产阶级思想。我们工人阶级要做真正的无产阶级革命派，就要以革命利益为重，坚决克服本位主义。”他们主动提出，谁高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，就选举谁到总指挥部领导岗位上去。其他革命组织热烈响应，经过充分酝酿，把各个革命组织里坚决按毛主席指示办事，立场坚定，斗争勇敢的真正的无产阶级革命派选到了总指挥部领导岗位上，组成了坚强的领导核心。从此，大家团结得更紧了，又有十多个革命组织参加了总指挥部。
    帮助革命派活学活用毛主席著作
    对领导干部进行阶级分析  更好地贯彻“三结合”方针
    帮助无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，分清敌我，团结革命的领导干部，更好地实行“三结合”。在夺权斗争中，许多革命的领导干部积极站在毛主席的正确路线一边，站在无产阶级革命造反派一边，和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开斗争。但是无产阶级革命派中有一些人没有坚决按照毛主席的干部政策办事，认为只要是当权派，就一概不能相信，不分青红皂白，一脚踢开，统统打倒；有的则把革命的领导干部当作“知情人”，只是让他们揭发一些问题，没有很好地发挥他们的作用。部队指战员认识到这样不利于壮大革命力量，不利于孤立和集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁阶级敌人的反革命修正主义堡垒。指战员们就和革命的工人、农民、学生、干部一起，学习毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”学习《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》。省军区的负责同志又帮助山西省革命造反总指挥部总结了夺权斗争中革命造反派、革命领导干部和人民解放军三结合的成功经验。
    经过学习，广大无产阶级造反派认识到，对待领导干部要进行阶级分析，不但要看到他们的一时一事，而且要看到他们的全部历史和全部工作。对运动中犯了一些错误的干部，要采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，帮助他们改正错误，允许他们革命。这是毛主席的一贯教导。不加分析，一概否定领导干部的做法，是不符合毛泽东思想的。认识提高后，广大革命工人、学生、干部就用阶级分析的方法对待领导干部，凡是拥护毛主席、执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的领导干部就团结、就联合；凡是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就坚决斗争，坚决打击。山西省革命造反总指挥部、太原革命造反司令部，以及许多工厂、机关、学校的无产阶级革命派，都吸收了本单位的革命领导干部参加领导工作。西山矿务局一个处长，在运动中和无产阶级革命派共同作战，揭露矿务局一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反党反社会主义的罪行，革命群众就给他戴上无产阶级革命派组织“矿山烈火”的红袖章。太原纺织厂有一部分革命的领导干部，过去一心一意为党工作，文化大革命运动中一直支持无产阶级革命派，无产阶级革命派夺权后就把他们选进革命生产委员会，继续领导生产。无产阶级革命派从实践中体会到，团结革命的领导干部有四大好处：一、壮大了无产阶级革命派的力量；二、孤立和打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；三、有助于加速夺权以后的巩固和建设工作；四、有利于“抓革命，促生产”，能够很快地建立起新的生产秩序。
    帮助革命派活学活用毛主席著作
    开展政治攻势瓦解右派组织  团结中间派壮大革命的力量
    帮助无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展政治攻势，分化瓦解右派组织，教育受蒙蔽的群众觉醒，壮大革命的力量。太原纺织厂“红卫兵”组织被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派操纵后，干了许多坏事。但是“红卫兵”里大多数群众是受蒙骗的。革命派组织“红卫队”夺权后，有些人讽刺挖苦“红卫兵”中受蒙骗的群众。因而“红卫兵”中一些群众和“红卫队”之间的对立情绪更加严重。山西省军区机关的一些领导同志，就和“红卫队”负责人深谈了一夜，说服大家不能用感情代替政策。经过耐心说服，“红卫队”队员觉悟大大提高，他们一方面写大字报，举办实物展览，揭露厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命罪行；另一方面，诚恳地和“红卫兵”中受蒙骗的群众谈心，耐心进行帮助。许多受蒙蔽的群众看清了坏蛋们的反动嘴脸，认识到自己站错了队，纷纷站起来造走资本主义道路当权派的反，并宣布退出被坏人操纵的“红卫兵”，参加了“红卫队”。对一些反动组织和反革命分子的破坏活动，部队则坚决镇压。
    山西省军区和驻山西部队经过一段时间宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众的艰苦细致工作，山西省无产阶级革命派的力量日益发展壮大，巩固和建设革命秩序的工作取得了很大成绩。最近，山西省军区、驻山西部队初步总结了支持无产阶级革命派的经验。他们体会到，做好帮助无产阶级革命派巩固和建设革命秩序的工作，必须：一、听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决支持左派，打击右派，誓作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾；二、以毛泽东思想为武器，宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，帮助无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的同时，认真改造非无产阶级世界观，夺头脑中“私”字的权。这样，才能把无产阶级革命派的队伍，建成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍；三、部队要变成群众工作队，和群众一起革命，互相学习，互相帮助，扎扎实实地进行深入细致的思想政治工作。并以革命左派为核心，使广大革命干部和革命群众联合在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，最大限度地孤立、打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在总结经验的基础上，中国人民解放军山西省军区、驻山西部队继续采取新的措施，又抽调大批优秀的指战员到工厂、学校、机关去做群众工作，进一步帮助无产阶级革命派巩固和建设革命秩序，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
