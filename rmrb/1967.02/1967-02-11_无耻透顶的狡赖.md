Title: Shamelessly Brazen Denial

The U.S. State Department spokesman, Rusk, issued a statement on the 3rd, desperately denying the crime of the U.S. imperialists forcibly abducting and persecuting 48 fishermen from Danzhou County, Guangdong Province, China. He shamelessly claimed that the political conspiracy hatched by the U.S. imperialists in collusion with the South Vietnamese puppet regime and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was a "purely humanitarian action."

This denial is truly shameless!

What "purely humanitarian action"? How dare you say that! You talk about "humanitarianism" but commit bloody acts of imperialist aggression. You openly invade Vietnam, savagely massacre the Vietnamese people, and madly bomb Vietnam—that is your so-called "humanitarianism." You dispatch planes and warships to repeatedly violate China's airspace and territorial waters, even abducting Chinese fishermen to extract information related to China, preparing for the invasion of China—that is your so-called "humanitarianism." You think you can cover up your despicable and filthy deeds with grand and righteous words—that is absolutely impossible!

Chairman Mao has long said: "The counter-revolutionary work of the imperialist governments is done every day, but in words, in official documents, it is always full of righteousness and morality, or at least somewhat righteous and moral, never telling the truth." The cunning and crafty U.S. State Department is acting exactly according to this rule. However, the evidence of the U.S. imperialists abducting and persecuting Chinese fishermen is all in the hands of the Chinese people. The U.S. State Department cannot deny it. The more it tries to wash away its crimes, the more it reveals its cowardice and guilt.

    无耻透顶的狡赖
    美国国务院发言人巴奇在三日发表了一个声明，竭力抵赖美帝国主义强行劫持和迫害我国广东儋县四十八名渔民的罪行，竟然把美帝国主义勾结南越傀儡当局和蒋介石匪帮搞的这个政治阴谋，说成是什么“单纯的人道主义的行动”。
    这种狡赖，真是无耻透顶！
    什么“单纯的人道主义的行动”？亏你们说得出口！你们嘴上说“人道主义”，干的是帝国主义的血腥的侵略罪行。你们公然侵略越南，野蛮地屠杀越南人民，疯狂轰炸越南，这就是你们的所谓“人道主义”。你们派遣飞机军舰不断侵犯中国的领空领海，甚至劫持中国渔民逼取有关中国的情报，为侵略中国作准备，这就是你们的所谓“人道主义”。你们想用冠冕堂皇的词句遮掩卑鄙龌龊的勾当，那是绝对办不到的！
    毛主席早就说过：“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。”老奸巨猾的美国国务院正是按着这个规律办事的。但是，美帝国主义劫持迫害中国渔民的罪证都在中国人民手里，美国国务院要赖是赖不掉的。它越是想洗刷自己的罪名，就越显得它是何等的贼胆心虚。
