The proletarian revolutionary rebels must firmly grasp the leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly grasp the leadership of socialist politics and economy. How? By relying on the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, by relying on the boundless wisdom and strength of the revolutionary masses, by relying on the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels on the great principles of Mao Zedong Thought, and by relying on the great unity of all revolutionary forces with the revolutionary rebel organizations as the core!

Great unity is the strong call of every revolutionary rebel!
Great unity is the new great battle call issued by the great helmsman Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to us revolutionary rebels!
Great unity is the requirement of the times, the inevitable trend of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." Only by implementing great unity can the revolutionary rebels fundamentally solve the fundamental problem of the revolution—the problem of power.

Only by implementing great unity can the revolutionary rebels form a vast army of cultural revolution, ready to smash the new conspiracies and counterattacks of the class enemies at any time, and thoroughly complete the great historical task of one struggle, two lines, and three changes.

Without the great unity of the revolutionary rebels, seizing the power of the capitalist roaders is just empty talk!

All class enemies are extremely afraid of and strongly oppose the great unity of the revolutionary rebels. The day the revolutionary rebels implement great unity is the day the enemies begin to collapse completely! The more the class enemies are afraid of and oppose our great unity, the more we revolutionary rebels need great unity!

However, within our revolutionary rebel ranks, there are still a few people who are afraid that after unity, the "troops will not be pure," afraid that after unity, the "leadership will not be in the hands of the true revolutionaries and leftists," and so on. This is a view that does not believe in the masses. Don't the broad revolutionary rebels understand the principles and policies of great unity? Don't the broad revolutionary rebels know how to distinguish who is a true revolutionary and a true leftist? No! The broad revolutionary rebels, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by more than half a year of cultural revolution, are the most capable of identifying cadres and grasping the principles of great unity.

Chairman Mao said: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the Party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will stop." In the process of great unity, it is normal for the revolutionary rebels to have various disagreements. As long as we do not avoid contradictions and are afraid of struggles, but face them and handle them correctly, it will not hinder our great unity, but will strengthen our great unity!

After great unity, it will not be "ironclad" as some people say, but there will still be various ideological contradictions and struggles. It is precisely this struggle that determines that our revolutionary rebel army has vigorous vitality and strong combat effectiveness.

The process of great unity is necessarily a process of struggle between "public" and "private," a process of transforming one's worldview. "The world is vast, and one should have a broad vision." All revolutionary rebels must study and apply the "Three Articles" diligently, break with "private" interests, and establish "public" interests, serving the people wholeheartedly.

"Everything should be done from the people's interests, not from the interests of individuals or small groups," this is the purpose of our great unity.

Those compromising and reformist things, those things of small-groupism, sectarianism, dispersionism, splitism, and small mountain-headism, and those things of "I am the only one" must all be overthrown!

"Many things are urgent; the world turns, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let us unite, combine, fight, and win together! This is the urgent task of all revolutionary rebels! Great unity is imperative!

### 破“私”立“公”大联合

    破“私”立“公”大联合
    浙江大学红色造反联络站《红卫兵报》编辑部
    无产阶级革命造反派要牢牢掌握无产阶级文化大革命的领导权，牢牢掌握社会主义政治、经济的领导权，靠什么？靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠革命群众的无穷无尽的智慧与力量，靠无产阶级革命造反派在伟大的毛泽东思想原则基础上的大联合，靠一切革命力量以革命造反派组织为核心的大团结！
    大联合，是每个革命造反者的强烈呼声！
    大联合，是伟大舵手毛主席和党中央向我们革命造反派发出的新的伟大战斗号召！
    大联合，是时代的要求，无产阶级文化大革命的大势所趋！
    毛主席说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”革命造反派只有实行大联合，才能从根本上解决革命的根本问题——政权问题。
    革命造反派只有实行大联合，才能结成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，随时粉碎阶级敌人的新阴谋，新反扑，彻底完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务。
    没有革命派的大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权只是一句空话！
    一切阶级敌人十分害怕、极力反对革命造反派的大联合。革命造反派大联合之日，就是敌人开始彻底垮台之时！阶级敌人越是害怕、越是反对我们大联合，我们革命造反派就越是需要大联合！
    然而，在我们革命造反派队伍内部，还有极少数人怕联合后“队伍不纯”，怕联合后“领导权不能掌握在真正的革命左派的手里”，等等。这是一种不相信群众的论调。难道广大的革命造反者不懂得大联合的原则、政策吗？难道广大的革命造反者不会识别谁是真革命、真左派吗？否！用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过半年多文化革命战火考验的广大革命造反者，最能识别干部，最能掌握大联合的原则。
    毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”在大联合中，革命造反派内部产生这样那样的分歧，这是正常的。只要我们不是回避矛盾，害怕斗争，而是正视它，正确处理它，不仅不会妨碍我们的大联合，相反只会加强我们的大联合！
    在大联合后，也决不会象有些人所说的“铁板一块”，还会发生各种思想的对立与斗争，正是这种斗争，决定了我们革命造反大军具有旺盛的生命力与坚强的战斗力。
    大联合的过程，必然是一个“公”与“私”的斗争过程，世界观的改造过程。“风物长宜放眼量。”一切革命造反派必须狠学狠用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，“全心全意地为人民服务”。
    “一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，这是我们大联合的宗旨。
    那些折衷主义、改良主义的东西，那些小团体主义、宗派主义、分散主义、分裂主义以及小山头主义、唯我独尊的东西，必须统统打倒！
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗下团结在一起，联合在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，这是一切革命造反派的当务之急！非大联合不可！
