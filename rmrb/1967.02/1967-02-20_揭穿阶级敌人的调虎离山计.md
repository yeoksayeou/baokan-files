Editor's Note: Inciting the knowledge youth to leave their production posts in large numbers and rush to the cities is a new form of counterattack by the reactionary bourgeoisie line. This conspiracy has been thoroughly exposed, and many deceived knowledge youth have resolutely declared: Immediately return to the countryside, make revolution on the spot. Revolutionary rebels should warmly welcome and resolutely support their revolutionary actions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things."

In recent years, a large number of knowledge youth have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, rushing to the countryside and the border areas, where they have united with the poor and lower-middle peasants, becoming an important striking force on the agricultural front.

At present, the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside is flourishing, and the spring plowing production peak is about to arrive. At this critical moment, the knowledge youth who have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside should resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," firmly hold their posts, and continue the struggle. Those who have left the countryside should quickly return to the countryside, strike a counterattack, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, make a big fuss against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and make a big fuss against the reactionary bourgeoisie line. Grasp the revolution and promote production, and make the revolution and production in the countryside better and better.

Exposing the Class Enemy's Strategy of Luring the Tiger Away from the Mountain

Currently, the proletarian cultural revolution is developing in a deeper and broader direction, and more extensive revolutionary mass movements are rising in factories and the countryside.

The revolutionary knowledge youth who have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside are also, together with the revolutionary workers and peasants across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, joining the torrent of the proletarian cultural revolution. They have lifted the lid on class struggle in the countryside and achieved initial victories.

Our great leader Chairman Mao is most concerned about us youth. Chairman Mao said: "... All the knowledge youth and student youth in the country must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, become one with them, and form a powerful army. This is an army of tens of millions of people! With this great army, we can attack the enemy's strongholds and break through the enemy's last bastions." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually unite with the workers and peasants." We understand: To do well in the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside and to revolutionize our own thinking, we must unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants. We can only strive to learn and propagate Mao Zedong Thought in the vast expanse of the countryside, propagate the party's policies, propagate the Sixteen Points, and actively open fire on the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and snakes. Only in this way can we live up to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's teachings and expectations for us.

The enemy will not voluntarily retreat from the stage of history; they will struggle desperately before their death. In the previous period, the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the reactionary bourgeoisie line incited evil winds and lit evil fires, instigating the deceived knowledge youth who went down to the countryside to return to the cities. They also stirred up some knowledge youth who are not content to stay in the countryside, using certain shortcomings in the placement of work, making a fuss about returning to the cities, causing a large number of knowledge youth who have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside not to participate in the cultural revolution in the countryside, leaving their production posts, and separating from the poor and lower-middle peasants, even opposing the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a big conspiracy. This is clearly a trick played by a handful of people to lure the tiger away from the mountain, and it is clearly a vicious conspiracy by a handful of bad elements to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. We must expose their conspiracies and tricks!

Seeing that agricultural production is affected, we feel very heartbroken! We are here to make revolution in the countryside in response to Chairman Mao's call, to unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is an important measure to prevent revisionism and oppose revisionism. We should stand with the poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly hold our battle positions, work together, aim our guns at the enemy, and direct our spearheads at the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly insist on the reactionary bourgeoisie line. We should listen to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, be content to participate in agricultural production, and participate in the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside.

Revolutionary comrades, true revolutionaries must take the fate of the proletarian cultural revolution into their own hands. To carry out the proletarian cultural revolution, we must revolutionize people's thinking, eliminate the "self" and establish the "public," so that all work is done more, faster, better, and more economically, and build an extremely powerful red socialist state. We are the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and we listen to Chairman Mao the most. We went to the countryside to make revolution according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Going up to the mountains and down to the countryside is right a thousand times, right ten thousand times! We should return to the countryside, expose the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink!

The wind tests the strong grass, and the cold weather tests the pines and cypresses. Chairman Mao calls on us to temper and grow in great storms. This proletarian cultural revolution is a complex and sharp class struggle storm, and this is the crucial moment to temper and test us. True revolutionary knowledge youth must go to the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite with them, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," smash all the new counterattacks of the reactionary bourgeoisie line! Carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to the end!

专栏：

    编者按：煽动上山下乡的知识青年大批地离开生产岗位，涌到城市，这是资产阶级反动路线新反扑的又一种形式。这一阴谋诡计已经被彻底揭穿了，许多受蒙蔽的知识青年坚决表示：立即打回农村去，就地闹革命。革命造反派应当热烈欢迎和坚决支持他们的这一革命行动。
    毛主席教导我们说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”
  近几年来，大批知识青年积极响应毛主席的号召，热情地奔赴农村，奔赴边疆，在那里和贫下中农结合，成为农业战线上的一支重要的突击力量。
    当前，农村的无产阶级文化大革命正在蓬勃兴起，春耕生产高潮即将到来。在这关键的时刻，上山下乡知识青年更应该坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚守岗位，坚持战斗。已经离开农村的要迅速返回农村，杀一个回马枪，和贫下中农一道大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，狠抓革命，大促生产，把农村的革命和生产搞得好上加好。
    揭穿阶级敌人的调虎离山计
    山东平度县毛泽东思想红卫兵下乡知识青年  誓死卫东战斗队
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命正在向着更深入、更广阔的方面发展，工厂和农村更大规模的革命群众运动正在兴起。
    上山下乡的革命知识青年，也和全国广大革命工农群众一道，在毛主席的领导下，投入了无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，揭开了农村阶级斗争的盖子，取得了初步的胜利。
  我们伟大的领袖毛主席最关心我们青年。毛主席说：“……全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体，才能形成一支强有力的军队。这是一支几万万人的军队呵！有了这支大军，才能攻破敌人的坚固阵地，才能攻破敌人的最后堡垒。”毛主席还教导我们：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”我们懂得：要搞好农村的无产阶级文化大革命，搞好我们自己的思想革命化，就必须和贫下中农结合。我们只有在农村的广阔天地里努力学习和宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，宣传十六条，积极向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神开火，才能不辜负毛主席和党中央对我们的教导和希望。
    敌人是不会自动退出历史舞台的，他们在临死前还要作垂死的挣扎。前一时期，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，他们煽阴风，点邪火，唆使受蒙蔽的下乡知识青年回到城市。他们还挑动一些不安心在农村的知识青年，借安置工作中存在的某些缺点，闹着要回城市，使大批上山下乡知识青年不参加农村的文化大革命，离开了自己的生产岗位，脱离了贫下中农，甚至和贫下中农闹对立。这是一个大阴谋。这分明是一小撮人耍的调虎离山计，这分明是一小撮坏蛋破坏无产阶级文化大革命的恶毒阴谋。我们一定要揭穿他们的阴谋诡计！
    眼看农业生产受到影响，我们感到十分痛心！我们是响应毛主席号召来农村干革命的，到农村和贫下中农相结合的，这是防止修正主义和反对修正主义的重要措施。我们应该和贫下中农站在一起，坚守战斗岗位，同心协力，枪口对敌，把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人。我们要听毛主席和党中央的话，安心参加农业生产，参加农村的无产阶级文化大革命。
    革命的同志们，真正的革命者一定要把无产阶级文化大革命的命运掌握在自己手里。搞无产阶级文化大革命，就是要使人的思想革命化，破除一个“私”字，树立一个“公”字，使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省，建设一个无比强大的红彤彤的社会主义国家。我们是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我们最听毛主席的话。我们到农村去是照毛主席的指示干革命去的。我们上山下乡，就是一千个对！一万个对！我们应该打回农村去，把一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来，把他们彻底斗倒，斗垮，斗臭！
    疾风见劲草，岁寒知松柏。毛主席号召我们在大风大浪里锻炼成长。这场无产阶级文化大革命就是一场错综复杂、尖锐激烈的阶级斗争的大风浪，这正是锻炼和考验我们的关键时刻。真正的革命知识青年必须到贫下中农中去，与贫下中农结合在一起，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，粉碎一切资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！把农村的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
