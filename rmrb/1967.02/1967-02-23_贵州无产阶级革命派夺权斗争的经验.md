The Experience of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction in Guizhou's Seizure of Power

New China News Agency, Guiyang, February 22 -- The Experience of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction in Guizhou's Seizure of Power

"All revolutionary struggles in the world are directed against oppression. Oppression is always on the side of the oppressor, and the oppressed are always on the side of the revolution. The oppressors will fight to the death to maintain their power, and the oppressed will fight to the death to overthrow it."

The proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou united, seizing power from a small clique within the provincial and municipal committees who were taking the capitalist road. This was the first thunderclap in the winter of the southwest!

Seizing power is an inevitable product of the development of the Cultural Revolution and a decisive battle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. However, seizing power under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship is unprecedented. How to fight? How to seize power? How to choose the timing? What to do after seizing power? These questions all have their own characteristics and laws, and it is worth summarizing them well. Our experience is as follows:

To ensure the success of seizing power, revolutionary factions must achieve great unity and establish a powerful temporary power organ as the command center for seizing power.

In the struggle to seize power, adhere to the principle of "combining internal and external forces, with internal forces as the main focus," and do not take over or act as saviors.

The principle of forming a temporary power organ must be "three-in-one." Whether this can be achieved is the mark of whether it is a genuine seizure of power or a fake seizure of power, or an "ultra-leftist" seizure of power.

Bureaucratic institutions must be thoroughly reorganized.

I. To seize power, the proletarian revolutionary factions must achieve great unity and establish a powerful temporary power organ as the command center for seizing power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary things, if you do not fight them, will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." The small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Guizhou Provincial Committee and Guiyang Municipal Committee have been practicing brutal bourgeois dictatorship over the people for a long time and over a wide area, which is rare in the country. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Through struggle, the lid of class struggle within the provincial and municipal committees has been blown off. The ugly face of the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists has been exposed to the light of day. The party and government organs of the province and city have completely collapsed. Seizing power is the urgent demand of the people of the entire province. In the great struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the people have organized themselves and have been tempered in the severe struggle, forming a powerful revolutionary force. This is the main force to ensure the success of seizing power. Without such a force, power cannot be seized.

The proletarian revolutionary factions must achieve great unity to seize power!

Seizing power by the proletarian revolutionary factions is a great revolution and a decisive battle. Having a force, one must also have a command center to direct the battle, a unified proletarian command center with unified thinking, unified will, and unified actions. It is the nerve center for directing the battle.

The basic situation of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou before seizing power was as follows: the industrial, construction, agricultural, forestry, financial, commercial, educational, and cultural systems, as well as the party and government organs of the province and city, had already established combat organizations of a certain scale and had initially achieved great unity within their systems and departments. In the city, revolutionary liaison organizations for great unity of the revolutionary factions had also emerged. Most of these revolutionary organizations had already seized power within their departments and grassroots units. For example, most of the departments and commissions of the provincial committee had been seized by the revolutionary factions. The provincial public security bureau and the "New Guizhou Daily" and other instruments of dictatorship were also in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. This created favorable conditions for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize power from the small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Therefore, once the time was right, with one order, the party, government, military, and people could quickly unite to establish a temporary power organ of the proletariat that is supported by the masses—the general command, forming a vast army to seize power, breaking through strongholds, and achieving a decisive victory in one go.

"External factors are conditions for change, internal factors are the basis for change, and external factors work through internal factors." In the struggle to seize power, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou strictly followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, adhering to the principle of "combining internal and external forces, with internal forces as the main focus," firmly relying on the revolutionary leftists within the party and government organs of the province and city, not taking over or acting as saviors. This is another important factor in achieving the success of seizing power.

Before taking action to seize power, the revolutionary liaison station of the provincial committee's organs convened a meeting of the responsible comrades of the revolutionary factions of the affiliated departments and commissions to study and formulate an action plan. Necessary measures were taken for departments that were weak in revolutionary forces. This action plan was agreed to and supported by the revolutionary leading cadres within the provincial committee. Thus, when the external revolutionary factions' army to seize power arrived, the revolutionary factions within the provincial committee's organs, including the revolutionary leading cadres, all provided powerful support. This ensured that the seizure of power could be carried out smoothly and achieved victory in one battle.

The first and foremost task facing the proletarian revolutionary factions after seizing power is to consolidate power. The temporary power organ for seizing power must be quickly improved and a more perfect proletarian power organ established that can fully exercise its functions. This organ is the supreme leading organ. Its general task is to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the entire province. In the current stage, it is responsible for exercising all the powers of the party, government, finance, and culture in the entire province. In the future, it will also be a supervisory organ. The principle of forming this organ must be the "three-in-one" combination of representatives of truly representative revolutionary mass organizations, responsible comrades of local stationed troops, and revolutionary leading cadres of party and government organs. This is extremely important. Whether this can be achieved is the mark of whether it is a genuine seizure of power or a fake seizure of power, or an "ultra-leftist" seizure of power. After deliberation and consultation, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, which was formally established on February 13, was produced in accordance with this principle.

The organizational form serves the political task. The organizational form of the revolutionary committee is a product of the current stage of the Cultural Revolution and serves the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Under this committee, several leading groups and working organs are set up, such as the leading groups for cultural revolution, production, security, and secretariat; under the leading group for cultural revolution, there are also four working organs for rural areas, mines, education, and cadre work. The leadership of these organs is completely in the hands of the revolutionary factions, and they exercise the power of the revolutionary factions through these organs.

Establishing these working organs is necessary, but they must be few and efficient, with high work efficiency. The original state organs were very bloated, large, and overlapping, and were a bureaucratic institution. Handling a work issue was like kicking a ball back and forth, and the phenomenon of documents traveling far and wide was common. This goes against the glorious tradition of our party in the revolutionary war era and against Chairman Mao's teachings on streamlining administration. These bureaucratic institutions completely copied the Soviet revisionists' methods, serving a small clique of bad elements to form factions, place their cronies, and rule the people. Today, they must be thoroughly reorganized. Therefore, what kind of organizational organs the revolutionary factions establish is a major issue related to the struggle between the two lines and the two roads. This is a new topic of great destruction and great construction that needs to be continuously created and summarized in practice, making the revolutionary organs more revolutionary and more scientific.

In view of the complex social situation, the strategy of "seizing from above and sweeping from below, attacking from both sides" was adopted without hesitation to suppress counter-revolutionaries and remove obstacles to seizing power.

II. The social situation is relatively complex. Since the movement began, the ghosts and snakes in society have been sufficiently exposed, which is a characteristic of Guizhou different from other provinces. In view of this characteristic, the strategy of "seizing from above and sweeping from below, attacking from both sides" was adopted. That is, seizing power from above, sweeping the ghosts and snakes from below, and firmly suppressing the small clique of bad elements within the so-called "Red Guards" and the so-called "Patrol Teams" manufactured by the provincial committee, which appeared in an ultra-leftist guise, to remove obstacles to seizing power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, and some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." The struggle to seize power is precisely a serious class struggle. The proletarian revolutionary factions want to rebel and seize power. A small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road will inevitably put up a desperate resistance. The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society will also take advantage of the situation. At the critical moment of the proletarian revolutionary factions' struggle to seize power, they will jump out like cornered dogs, collude with the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the provincial and municipal committees, and join forces in a desperate attempt to carry out counter-revolutionary unity to oppose the great unity of the revolutionary factions. They attempt to seize power first with fake seizures of power.

The proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou were facing such an objective reality when they seized power. This posed a task for the proletarian revolutionary factions: to seize power, they must concentrate superior forces to capture the command center of the small clique of those in power within the provincial and municipal committees who are taking the capitalist road in one go. In this way, the proletarian revolutionary factions will gain the initiative in the struggle to seize power. As long as the conditions are basically met, the proletarian revolutionary factions should seize the opportunity and take action to seize power.

The proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou recognized the situation and tasks they faced. With the support of the broad masses of cadres and fighters of the Guizhou Military Region, they adopted the strategy of "seizing from above and sweeping from below, attacking from both sides" without hesitation. While seizing power from the small clique of those in power within the provincial and municipal committees who are taking the capitalist road, they mobilized the People's Liberation Army to suppress the so-called "Red Guards" and "Red Guards" with strong forces, and promptly and resolutely suppressed the ringleaders of these counter-revolutionary groups. For the so-called "Patrol Teams," they also promptly launched a powerful political offensive, striking at the main leaders, and carrying out division and dissolution, causing these organizations to collapse in a flash, disrupting their counter-revolutionary deployments, and crushing their reactionary momentum.

In the process of "seizing from above and sweeping from below, attacking from both sides," the clear support of the People's Liberation Army was a crucial link to victory. "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." Even under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an unshakable truth. The proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou were able to seize power smoothly and control the situation after seizing power, precisely because of this reason.

The temporary power organ should promptly, based on local realities, concentrate the revolutionary demands of the masses, and issue a clear political program and policies, issuing a "Proclamation to the People."

III. Although the proletarian revolutionary factions' united seizure of power is just the beginning and the first step of a long march, its political impact is enormous. After the seizure of power is realized, the temporary power organ should promptly, based on local realities, concentrate the revolutionary demands of the masses, and issue a clear political program and policies, issuing a "Proclamation to the People."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be good at turning the party's policies into the actions of the masses, to be good at making every movement and struggle of ours not only understood by the leading cadres but also understood and grasped by the broad masses, this is a Marxist-Leninist leadership art." The proletarian revolutionary factions' seizure of power must rely on the broad revolutionary masses to complete, and therefore, it is a magnificent mass movement. In the proletarian revolutionary factions' seizure of power, what should people do? What should be done after seizing power? These are all closely watched by the broad revolutionary masses. As the temporary power organ of the proletarian seizure of power, it is responsible for telling them all this in the fastest way possible.

During the process of seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou issued the "Notice on Seizing Power" to the people of the entire province, proposing five demands, as well as the "Notice on Several Regulations Regarding Mass Organizations That Have Been Infiltrated and Seized by the Ghosts and Snakes in Society," the "Ten Orders," and so on. These notices and orders, because they met the demands of the masses and were issued in a timely manner, all played a great role in boosting the morale of the revolutionary leftists and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies; played a good role in splitting and dissolving reactionary organizations and strengthening the revolutionary leftist forces; played a good role in promptly reversing the situation and stabilizing people's minds. These notices and orders, because they well reflected Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies, reflected the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship, were therefore warmly supported by the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in the province. Taking the "Ten Orders" on the handling of cadres as an example, this order proposed the "five-character policy" of grabbing, dismissing, promoting, retaining, and transferring. Because it correctly reflected the party's traditional policy of distinguishing between different types of cadres, it made some revolutionary proletarian cadres in power feel more the party's care and warmth, bravely stand out, and reveal their identities. They quickly won the trust of the masses and actively participated in the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions' united seizure of power, becoming the backbone or leaders of the seizure of power struggle; some cadres who made mistakes but not serious ones also saw the future, put down their burdens, and were willing to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, creating new merits for the people. In this way, the proletarian revolutionary factions were supported by the majority of the people, consolidating the seized power.

In the end, the most important thing is to highlight Mao Zedong Thought.

In the end, the most important thing is to highlight Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionary factions in Guizhou had a profound realization in the struggle to seize power: whatever was done according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the proletarian revolutionary factions' seizure of power was successful. Conversely, it would fail and encounter setbacks. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions' seizure of power in Guizhou is deeply developing, and the seizure of power struggle is far from over. The arduous tasks facing the proletarian revolutionary factions are still daunting. The historical mission of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is on our shoulders. We must make the boundless rays of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the Guizhou Plateau, making the sky of Guizhou the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, and the land of Guizhou the land of Mao Zedong Thought.

"The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today it is better than before, the world is upside down, and the times are changing."

Guizhou will undergo a thorough transformation! Sing loudly and march forward!

    贵州无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的经验
    新华社贵阳二十二日电　贵州无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的经验
    “世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    贵州无产阶级革命派大联合，从省市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中，夺取了党、政、财、文大权。这是西南地区在隆冬季节响彻云霄的第一声春雷！
    夺权，是无产阶级文化大革命发展的必然产物，是无产阶级革命路线彻底击败资产阶级反动路线的一场大决战。但是，在无产阶级专政的条件下的夺权斗争，又是史无前例的事。仗怎么打？权怎么夺？时机如何选择？夺权后怎么办？等等，都有其特点和规律，值得很好总结。我们的经验是：
    要保证夺权胜利，必须实现革命派的大联合，建立有力的临时权力机构，作为夺权的指挥中枢。
    在夺权斗争中，坚持“内外结合，以内为主”的方针，不包办代替，不当救世主。
    临时权力机构的组成原则，必须实行“三结合”。能否做到这一点，是判断真夺权还是假夺权，还是过“左”的夺权的标志。
    官僚主义机构必须彻底改组。
    一、无产阶级革命派要夺权，要保证夺权胜利，必须实现革命派的大联合，建立有力的临时权力机构，作为夺权的指挥中枢。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”贵州省委、贵阳市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，对人民实行残酷的资产阶级专政，时间之久，范围之广，全国罕有。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。经过奋斗，省市委的阶级斗争盖子已经揭开。一小撮反革命修正主义分子的狰狞面目，已暴露于光天化日之下。省市党政机关，已经完全瘫痪。夺权，这是全省广大人民的迫切要求。在两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路的大搏斗中，人民组织起来了，并且在严重的斗争中受到了锻炼，形成了一支强大的革命队伍。这是保证夺权胜利的主要力量。没有这样一支力量，权是无法夺下来的。
    无产阶级革命派夺权必须实现大联合！
    无产阶级革命派夺权，是一场大革命，大决战。有了队伍，还得有指挥战斗的司令部，有统一思想，统一意志，统一步调的无产阶级指挥部。它是指挥战斗的神经中枢。
    贵州无产阶级革命派夺权前夕的基本情况是：工交、基建、农林、财贸、文教以及省市党政机关等许多系统和部门，已经建立了有一定规模的战斗组织，初步实现了按系统、按部门的大联合。在全市，也出现了革命派大联合的联络机构。这些革命组织，多数已在部门和基层单位夺了权。比如省委机关各部委，大多数为革命派夺了权。省公安厅和《新贵州报》等专政工具，大权也掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。这就给无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权创造了良好的条件。因此，时机一到，一声号令，党、政、军、民很快就能联合起来，建立一个为群众所拥护的无产阶级临时权力机构——总指挥部，组成浩浩荡荡的夺权大军，攻坚披锐，一鼓作气，打好这场歼灭战。
    “外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”在夺权斗争中，贵州无产阶级革命派紧紧遵循伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，坚持“内外结合，以内为主”的方针，坚定地依靠省市党政机关内部的革命左派，不包办代替，不当救世主。这是取得夺权胜利的又一重要因素。
    在采取夺权行动之前，省委机关的革命造反联络站，召集所属各部委的革命派负责人开会，研究和制订出行动计划。对革命力量薄弱的要害部门，采取了必要措施。这个行动计划，取得了省委内革命的领导干部的同意和支持。这样，外部革命派的夺权大军一到，省委机关内部的革命派包括革命领导干部在内，都给予了有力的配合。使夺权能够顺利地进行，一战告捷，马到成功。
    无产阶级革命派取得夺权胜利后面临的第一个首要任务是巩固权力。夺权的临时权力机构必须迅速健全，建立一个更为完善、能全面行使职权的无产阶级权力机构。这个机构是全权领导机构。它的总任务是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向全省人民宣传毛泽东思想。在现阶段，它负责行使全省党、政、财、文各种大权。在将来，它又是监督机构。这个机构的组成原则，必须实行真正有代表性的革命群众组织负责人、当地驻军负责人和党政机关革命领导干部的“三结合”。这是极为重要的。能否做到这一点，是判断真夺权还是假夺权，还是过“左”的夺权的标志。经过酝酿和协商，于二月十三日正式宣告成立的贵州省革命委员会，正是本着这一原则产生的。
    组织形式服从于政治任务，革命委员会的组织形式，是当前文化大革命进入新阶段的产物，是为无产阶级文化大革命服务的。这个委员会下设若干领导小组和办事机构。如文化革命、生产、保卫和秘书四个领导小组；在文化革命领导小组之下，又设农村、工矿、文教和干部工作四个办公机构。这些机构的领导权完全掌握在革命派手里，通过这些机构行使革命派的权力。
    建立这些办事机构是必要的，但是，一定要少而精，工作高效率。原来的国家机关十分臃肿、庞大、重叠，是一种官僚主义机构，处理一桩工作问题，象踢皮球似的踢来踢去，公文大旅行更是常见现象。这是违背我们党在革命战争时代的光荣传统的，是违反毛主席历来关于精兵简政的教导的。这些官僚主义机构完全照搬苏修的一套，为一小撮坏家伙结党营私，安插亲信，统治人民服务。今天必须彻底改组。因此，革命派建立什么样的组织机构，是关系到两条道路、两条路线斗争的重大问题。这是一个大破大立的崭新课题，需要在实践中不断创造、总结，使革命机构更加革命化，更加科学化。
    针对社会情况比较复杂的特点，毫不犹豫地采取“上夺下扫，左右开弓”的斗争策略，镇压反革命，扫清夺权障碍。
    二、社会情况比较复杂，自运动以来，社会上的牛鬼蛇神已有比较充分的暴露，这是贵州有别于其它省区的特点。针对这一特点，实行“上夺下扫，左右开弓”。即对上夺权，下扫牛鬼蛇神，对于以极“左”面目出现的“红卫军”和省委炮制的所谓“纠察队”中一小撮坏人进行坚决镇压，给夺权扫清障碍。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”夺权斗争，正是一场严重的阶级大搏斗。无产阶级革命派要造反，要夺权。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，必然要拚死抵抗。社会上的地富反坏右，也必然会伺机而动。在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的紧要关头，他们还会狗急跳墙，与省市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子勾结起来，狼狈为奸，迫不及待地搞反革命的联合，以对抗革命派的大联合。妄图抢先搞假夺权。
    贵州无产阶级革命派夺权时，正面临这样一种客观实际。它给无产阶级革命派提出了这样一个任务：夺权必须集中优势兵力，一举攻下省市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派这个指挥部。这样，无产阶级革命派就会赢得夺权斗争中的主动权。只要条件基本具备，无产阶级革命派就应该不失时机，下手夺权。
    贵州无产阶级革命派认清了面临的形势和任务。在贵州省军区广大指战员的支援下，毫不犹豫地采取了“上夺下扫，左右开弓”的斗争策略，在向省市委、省市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的同时，出动人民解放军对实力较大的所谓“红卫军”、所谓“赤卫队”中的反革命集团，进行了及时、坚决的镇压，依法逮捕了其中的首恶分子。而对于所谓“纠察队”，也及时发动了强大的政治攻势，打击其主要头目，进行分化瓦解，使得这些组织在迅雷不及掩耳中全线崩溃，打乱了他们的反革命部署，摧垮了他们的反动气焰。
    在“上夺下扫，左右开弓”的过程中，人民解放军的鲜明支持是致胜的重要环节。“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”即使在无产阶级专政的条件下，“枪杆子里面出政权”，也是一个颠扑不破的真理。贵州无产阶级革命派能够顺利实现夺权，以及夺权后无产阶级革命派能够控制局势，正是这一原因。
    临时权力机构应及时从当地实际出发，集中群众的革命要求，提出明确的政治纲领和方针政策，出“安民告示”。
    三、无产阶级革命派联合夺权虽然仅仅是开始，是万里长征迈出第一步，但它的政治影响极大。夺权实现后，临时权力机构应及时从当地实际出发，集中群众的革命要求，提出明确的政治纲领和方针政策，出“安民告示”。
    毛主席教导我们：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。”无产阶级革命派夺权，必须依靠广大革命群众来完成，因此，它是一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动。在无产阶级革命派夺权中，人们应该怎样做？夺权后，又该怎样做？这些，都是广大革命群众密切关注的。作为无产阶级夺权的临时权力机构，有责任把这一切，采取最迅速的方式告诉他们。
    贵州无产阶级革命派在夺权过程中，先后发布了向全省人民提出五项要求的《夺权通告》，以及《关于被社会上的牛鬼蛇神打入和篡夺领导权的群众组织的若干规定》的通告、《十项通令》等等。这些通告和通令，由于切合群众要求，发布及时，都起到了大长革命左派志气，大灭阶级敌人威风的极大作用；起到了分化瓦解反动组织，壮大革命左派队伍的良好作用；起到了及时扭转局势，稳定人心的良好作用。这些通告和通令，由于较好地体现了毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，体现了无产阶级专政的强大威力，因而受到了全省各族革命群众的热烈拥护。以关于干部处理问题的《十项通令》为例，这个通令提出的抓、罢、提、留、调的“五字方针”，由于正确地体现了党对各类干部区别对待的传统政策，因而使一些革命的无产阶级当权派，更加体会到党的关怀和温暖，勇敢地站出来亮了相。他们迅速受到了群众的信任，积极投入了无产阶级革命派联合夺权的斗争，成了夺权斗争中的骨干或领导；一些虽有错误、但不严重的干部，也看清了前途，放下了包袱，愿意改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，为人民创立新功。这样，就使无产阶级革命派受到大多数人的衷心拥护，巩固了夺得的权力。
    千条万条，归根结蒂，突出毛泽东思想是第一条。
    千条万条，归根结蒂，突出毛泽东思想是第一条。贵州无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中，一个极为深刻的体会是：凡是按照毛主席指示办事的，无产阶级革命派的夺权就胜利，就成功。反之，就失败，就遇到挫折。当前，贵州无产阶级革命派的夺权正深入地展开，夺权斗争远远没有结束。摆在无产阶级革命派面前的任务还很艰巨。无产阶级文化大革命的历史使命，挑在我们无产阶级革命派的肩上。我们一定要使光焰无际的毛泽东思想阳光普照贵州高原，使贵州的天，变成毛泽东思想的天，贵州的地，变成毛泽东思想的地。
    “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”
    贵州将彻底变革！高歌猛进！
