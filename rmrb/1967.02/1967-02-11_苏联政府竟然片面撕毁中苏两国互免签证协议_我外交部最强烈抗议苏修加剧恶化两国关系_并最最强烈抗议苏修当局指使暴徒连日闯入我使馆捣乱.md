The Soviet government has unilaterally torn up the Sino-Soviet visa exemption agreement. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged the strongest protest against the Soviet revisionists for further deteriorating relations between the two countries. We have also lodged the strongest protest against the Soviet authorities for directing thugs to repeatedly disrupt our embassy.

	New China News Agency, February 10th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China submitted a verbal statement to the Soviet Embassy in China on February 10th, protesting strongly against the Soviet government's unilateral tearing up of the visa exemption agreement between the two countries.

	The statement said that on February 9th, the Deputy Director of the Consular Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kantshukov, orally notified the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhiyao, that starting from February 12th, all Chinese citizens traveling to or transiting through the Soviet Union must obtain the appropriate visas from the Soviet embassies and consulates abroad for general reasons. Chinese citizens leaving the Soviet Union must hold Soviet exit visas. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China declares the following: The various agreements on mutual visa exemption between the two countries were successively proposed by the Soviet side starting in 1956. At that time, the Chinese side, in order to promote friendship between the peoples of the two countries, agreed to the Soviet side's suggestions and reached agreements on mutual visa exemption. Now, the Soviet government has unilaterally torn up the mutual visa exemption agreements between the two countries. This is another serious step by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique to escalate anti-China activities, sabotage the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, and further deteriorate relations between the two countries. The Chinese government strongly protests against this to the Soviet government. Due to the Soviet government's unilateral adoption of this unreasonable decision, the Chinese government has decided that starting from February 12th, all Soviet citizens entering, exiting, and transiting through the Chinese border must obtain Chinese visas.

	New China News Agency, February 10th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China submitted a verbal statement to the Soviet Embassy in China on February 10th, strongly protesting against the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for directing hundreds of thugs to disrupt the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union for four consecutive days, even entering our embassy's offices.

	The statement said that from February 6th to 9th, 1967, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique directed hundreds of thugs to disrupt in front of and even enter the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, committing outrageous acts, shamelessly shouting slogans against our great leader Chairman Mao and other anti-China slogans, openly setting up more than twenty anti-China banners in our embassy, and posting anti-China materials on our embassy door. More seriously, more than twenty thugs broke the lock and forcibly entered our office area to disrupt for more than twenty minutes.

	The statement said that it must be pointed out that this is a continuation and development of the January 25th bloody suppression of our students in Red Square and the February 3rd attack on our newsstand and beating of our diplomatic personnel, which are further serious crimes of violating Chinese sovereignty, destroying the most basic diplomatic norms, and relations between the two countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly protests against this to the Soviet government and demands that the Soviet government immediately and unconditionally implement the solemn requirements proposed in the Chinese government's statement on February 6th, immediately stop organizing Soviet thugs to disrupt the inviolability of our embassy in the Soviet Union, and effectively guarantee the safety of our embassy and our embassy personnel and their necessary working conditions. Otherwise, the Soviet government and the Soviet Embassy in China will bear all serious consequences arising therefrom.

	The statement said that it must also be pointed out that your organization of thugs to openly disrupt our embassy in the Soviet Union is a new crime that proves you have taken another more dangerous step in destroying Sino-Soviet relations. We ask, what do you intend to do with the continuous serious anti-China incidents you create? We warn the Soviet revisionist leadership clique that your insistence on being enemies of the Chinese people will not end well.

    苏联政府竟然片面撕毁中苏两国互免签证协议
    我外交部最强烈抗议苏修加剧恶化两国关系
    并最最强烈抗议苏修当局指使暴徒连日闯入我使馆捣乱
    新华社十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部代表二月十日向苏联驻华大使馆提出一项口头声明，就苏联政府片面撕毁两国互免签证的协议一事，向苏联政府提出最强烈抗议。
    声明说，二月九日苏联外交部领事局副局长康茹科夫口头通知中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远称：从二月十二日起，所有前往苏联和途经苏联领土的中国公民都必须根据一般理由在苏联驻外使领馆取得相应的签证。由苏联出境的中华人民共和国公民必须持有苏联出境签证。为此，中国外交部声明如下：中苏两国互免签证的各项协议，是苏联方面从一九五六年起陆续提出的，当时中国方面从促进两国人民的友谊出发，同意了苏方的建议，先后达成了有关互免签证的协议。现在苏联政府竟片面地撕毁了两国互免签证的协议，这是苏联修正主义领导集团加剧反华、破坏中苏两国人民友谊、进一步恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤。对此，中国政府向苏联政府提出最强烈的抗议。由于苏联政府片面采取这种无理的决定，中国政府决定自二月十二日起，所有苏联公民进、出和经过中国国境，都必须取得中国的签证。
    新华社十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部代表二月十日向苏联驻华大使馆提出一项口头声明，就苏修领导集团指使大批暴徒，连续四天在中国驻苏联大使馆前捣乱，甚至闯进我使馆办公重地的严重事件，向苏联政府提出最最强烈抗议。
    声明说，一九六七年二月六日、七日、八日、九日，苏修领导集团每天指使数百名暴徒在我驻苏联大使馆门前甚至闯进我驻苏联大使馆，胡作非为，放肆地狂喊反对我们伟大领袖毛主席的口号和其他反华口号，公然在我使馆内树立二十余块反华标语，并且在我使馆门上张贴反华材料。更严重的是，二十多个暴徒竟然破坏门锁，强行冲入我办公重地捣乱达二十余分钟。
    声明说，必须指出，这是苏修领导集团一手制造的一月二十五日镇压我留学生红场流血事件和二月三日抢走我新闻橱窗、毒打我外交人员的法西斯暴行的继续和发展，是它们进一步侵犯中国主权、破坏最起码的外交关系准则和中苏两国关系的又一严重罪行。对此，中国外交部向苏联政府提出最最强烈的抗议，并要求苏联政府立即不折不扣地实现中国政府二月六日声明中提出的严正要求，立即停止组织苏联暴徒破坏我驻苏联大使馆的神圣不可侵犯性，切实保障我大使馆、我大使馆人员的安全和他们必要的工作条件。否则，苏联政府和苏联驻华大使馆将要承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
    声明说，还必须指出，你们组织暴徒公然闯进我驻苏联大使馆捣乱，这一新罪行证明你们在破坏中苏关系的道路上又迈出了更加危险的一步。我们要问，你们制造层出不穷的严重反华事件，究竟要把中苏关系引向何处。我们要警告苏修领导集团，你们坚持与中国人民为敌到底，是决不会有好下场的。
