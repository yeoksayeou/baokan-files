According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Melbourne: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ, "Vanguard," published an article in its first issue of this year, enthusiastically praising "Mao Zedong Thought as the Marxism-Leninism of the era of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism."

"Vanguard" began publishing Chairman Mao Zedong's quotations in every issue last year and will continue to do so this year.

The article, titled "Why 'Vanguard' Publishes Mao Zedong Quotations," states, "We believe this is a question of profound influence and extreme importance." The article calls on Australian communists to analyze, study, and solve the problems of the Australian revolution according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

The article enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, which "illuminate the path of the world revolution." The article says, "The experience of China shows that whenever Mao Zedong Thought is abandoned, the revolution suffers setbacks. Whenever Mao Zedong Thought is followed, the revolution achieves victory." "World experience also shows that if Mao Zedong Thought is abandoned, the socialist revolution will suffer defeat. If Mao Zedong Thought is followed, victory will be achieved. In all questions of the world revolution, it has been proven that Mao Zedong is correct."

The article states: "Imperialism is collapsing. U.S. imperialism is more isolated than ever before. It is more divided than ever due to its own destructive contradictions. The emergence of Soviet revisionism is a result of imperialism's efforts to save itself from death. However, socialism is advancing to victory. China is a strong bastion of socialism.

	"Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism. Imperialism will not perish of its own accord, and the victory of socialism will not come of its own accord. Imperialism will not be overthrown without a fight. The victory of socialism must be won through struggle. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for this struggle."

The article concludes: "Vanguard accurately quotes Mao Zedong's quotations to arm the proletariat with the Marxism-Leninism of the era of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism." "Act according to the correct guidance of the Marxism-Leninism of our era—Mao Zedong Thought."

    澳共（马列）《先锋报》强调学习毛主席语录的重大意义
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑指导革命
    据新华社讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》今年第一期发表了一篇文章，热情颂扬“毛泽东思想是帝国主义崩溃、社会主义胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义”。
    《先锋报》去年开始在每一期上刊登毛泽东主席的语录。而且今年将继续这样做。
    这篇题为《为什么〈先锋报〉刊登毛泽东语录》的文章指出，“我们认为这是一个具有深远影响和极其重要性的问题。”文章号召澳大利亚共产党人根据毛主席的教导来分析、研究和解决澳大利亚革命的问题。
    文章热情赞扬毛主席的光辉思想“照亮了世界革命的道路。”文章说：“中国的经验表明，每当离开毛泽东思想的时候，革命就遭到挫折。每当遵循毛泽东思想的时候，革命就取得胜利。”“世界经验也表明，如果离开毛泽东思想，社会主义革命就要遭到失败。如果遵循毛泽东思想，就会取得胜利。在世界革命的一切问题上，事实证明毛泽东是正确的。”
    文章说：“帝国主义正在垮台。美帝国主义比过去任何时候都更加孤立。它由于自己的毁灭性的矛盾而变得更加四分五裂。苏联修正主义的出现是帝国主义为挽救自己免于死亡所作的努力的结果。但是，社会主义正在走向胜利。中国是社会主义的强大堡垒。
      “毛泽东思想是帝国主义崩溃、社会主义胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。帝国主义是不会自行灭亡的，而社会主义的胜利也是不会自行到来的。帝国主义是不打不倒的。社会主义的胜利是必须通过斗争来争取的。毛泽东思想是这个斗争的指路明灯。”
    文章最后说：“《先锋报》精确地引述毛泽东的语录，为的是用帝国主义崩溃、社会主义胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义武装工人阶级。”“按照我们时代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的正确指导行动。”
