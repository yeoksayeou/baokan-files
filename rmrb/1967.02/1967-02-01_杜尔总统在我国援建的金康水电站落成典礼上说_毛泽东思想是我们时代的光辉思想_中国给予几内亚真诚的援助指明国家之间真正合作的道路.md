According to Xinhua News Agency, Konakry, January 30th. The grand completion ceremony for the Jin Kang Hydropower Station, a water and electricity project aided by China, was held on the evening of the 28th. Tens of thousands of Guinean residents, dressed in festive attire, participated in the ceremony.

Guinea's President Sekou Toure cut the ribbon amidst cheers and applause. President Sekou Toure, along with members of the Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party, presided over the ceremony.

A delegation from the Chinese government, led by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Xiao, and Chinese experts working in Guinea, were invited to attend the ceremony.

President Sekou Toure delivered a speech at the ceremony. He warmly praised the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the great Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the brilliant ideology of our time. Chairman Mao is loyal to the people and uncompromising towards imperialism and colonialism." President Sekou Toure praised the achievements of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in the field of construction. He also praised the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Guinea. He said, "The People's Republic of China has given Guinea sincere and friendly aid, pointing the way to genuine cooperation among nations. Chinese experts not only built a hydropower station for us but also brought us their rich experience, enhancing the labor enthusiasm of our people and setting an example for us in national consciousness. All of this is truly valuable, more precious than the hydropower station itself."

President Sekou Toure announced that Guinea had decided to award the Labor Medal of the Republic of Guinea to the Chinese experts who participated in the construction of the hydropower station. President Sekou Toure concluded with the slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the friendly cooperation between China and Guinea!"

Liu Xiao, the head of the Chinese government delegation and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, was invited to speak at the ceremony. He said, "In less than two years, the Guinean people have rapidly completed this hydropower station. This vividly demonstrates that the Guinean people are a hardworking people who, after shaking off colonial rule, have shown high labor enthusiasm and wisdom in construction, achieving great successes." He wished the Guinean people, under the leadership of President Sekou Toure, even greater achievements in self-reliant development of the national economy.

Vice Minister Liu Xiao, speaking about the Cultural Revolution currently unfolding in China, said that this cultural revolution will accelerate China's construction and that the Chinese people, after this revolution, will make even greater contributions to the struggle for the complete liberation of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. He finally expressed that the Chinese people will always firmly support the just struggle of the Guinean people and the peoples of other Asian and African countries against imperialism and colonialism.

The completion ceremony was filled with a highly enthusiastic, friendly, and joyful atmosphere from beginning to end. In the brilliant hall, friends from China and Guinea celebrated their good cooperation. Guinean residents from nearby areas held colorful flags and repeatedly shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the friendly cooperation between China and Guinea!"

The Jin Kang Hydropower Station is located about 400 kilometers northeast of Konakry, near the Jin Kang Falls in the Fondajalon Mountains in central Guinea. The construction of the power station began in July 1964. The power station can provide electricity to major cities and agricultural areas in central Guinea.
