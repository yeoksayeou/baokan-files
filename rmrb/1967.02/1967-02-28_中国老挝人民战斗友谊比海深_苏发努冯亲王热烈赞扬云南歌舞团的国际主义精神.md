According to Xinhua News Agency, Kengkay, January 25th: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held a grand reception on January 31st in a certain place in the liberated area of Xam Neua to warmly see off the Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe of China. The troupe was invited to visit and perform in the liberated area of Xam Neua in early November last year.

Attending the reception were Chairman Souphanouvong of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and its members, representatives from the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, and various departments, organizations, and groups.

At the reception, Prince Souphanouvong spoke, praising the Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe for demonstrating a thorough revolutionary spirit, a spirit of serving the people, and a lofty internationalist spirit during their visit and performance in the liberated area of Xam Neua. He said, "This is the result of your being armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

Prince Souphanouvong said, "The visit and performance of the Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe of China have made significant contributions to the victories achieved by the Lao people and the Lao People's Liberation Army in implementing the dry season combat plan, to the common struggle of the Lao and world peoples against their vicious enemy—the U.S. imperialists, and to strengthening the combat unity and friendship between the peoples of the two countries, China and Laos."

At the reception, Yu Chengde, the director of the Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe, expressed that they would convey to the Chinese people the boundless love of the Lao military and people for the great leader Chairman Mao and the friendship of the Lao people for the Chinese people.

After the reception, Prince Souphanouvong, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, awarded the troupe with a First Class Issara Medal. At the subsequent banquet, the Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe and the Central Cultural Troupe of the Lao Patriotic Front performed many programs depicting the fighting life of the Lao people.
