A Latin American student studying in Cuba was engrossed in learning from an English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" that he had recently received from Chinese comrades. He was spotted by an African student, who immediately asked for the book. The Latin American student, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessness and serving the people wholeheartedly," gave his cherished red book to his African friend. From that moment on, the African student became engrossed in reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," even using the time spent on public buses to study.

Soon, the Latin American student received another copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" from Chinese comrades. Two weeks later, he told the Chinese comrade that the new copy had been taken by another African student. He joyfully said, "People love 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung' so much!"

    手不释卷
    一位在古巴的拉丁美洲留学生正在学习他不久前从中国同志那里得到的英文版《毛主席语录》的时候，被一位非洲同学发现了。这位非洲留学生当即要求他把这本《毛主席语录》送给他。这位拉丁美洲学生，按照毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，把他心爱的这本红书送给了这位非洲朋友。从此，这位非洲学生手不释卷地读起《毛主席语录》来了，甚至连乘坐公共汽车的时间也不放过。
    不久，这位拉丁美洲学生又从中国同志那里得到了一本《毛主席语录》。两个星期后，他对这位中国同志说，他刚得到的这本《毛主席语录》又被另一位非洲学生拿走了。他高兴地说：人们太喜爱《毛主席语录》了！
