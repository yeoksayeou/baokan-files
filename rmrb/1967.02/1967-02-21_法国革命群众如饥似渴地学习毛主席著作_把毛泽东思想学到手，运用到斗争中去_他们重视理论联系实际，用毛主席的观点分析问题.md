The French revolutionary masses are eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works. They are determined to master Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to their struggles. They emphasize the importance of linking theory with practice and using Chairman Mao's views to analyze problems.

The progressive masses in France cherish Mao Zedong's works and are eager to study them. They hope to master Mao Zedong Thought and use it as a weapon in their struggles.

Eager to Obtain Chairman Mao's Works

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has been vigorously carried out, Chairman Mao's works have been in constant short supply in France.

The manager of a bookstore in Paris that sells Chinese publications told a reporter that his store's monthly sales of Chairman Mao's works and other Chinese publications recently equaled three times the average monthly sales of the first half of last year.

The French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," affectionately known as the "Little Red Book," is particularly popular. Some workers' and students' organizations in the provinces, unable to obtain "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," sent representatives to Paris to request copies from Chinese friends. A class in a French middle school sent a representative to request 42 copies because every student in the class wanted one.

A Weapon for Anti-Revisionist Struggle

Six veteran members of the French Communist Party (F.C.P.) in Lille, who opposed revisionism, resigned from the F.C.P. at the end of last year. After obtaining a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in Paris, their representative solemnly said, "This is our weapon in the struggle against revisionism, the greatest support for us. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can fight better." After receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" sent by a friend, a primary school teacher, Mr. and Mrs. Aubry, wrote in their reply, "We received this book with great excitement. Its value is particularly precious because we regard Chairman Mao as the Lenin of our times. ... This book is the treasure of every Red Guard in People's China. We will always read it seriously and apply its invaluable teachings."

A French youth, after obtaining a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," wrote, "I will study the great Mao Zedong Thought repeatedly and memorize many of its points."

Acting According to Mao Zedong Thought

French Marxist-Leninist organizations and progressive youth organizations place great importance on studying Mao Zedong Thought. The organ of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist), "Nouvelle Humanité," repeatedly calls on its members to study Chairman Mao's works. An article published on December 8 last year called for "studying Mao Zedong Thought and acting according to Mao Zedong Thought." The article said, "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the criterion for judging whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary, a Marxist-Leninist or a revisionist."

Several leaders of the newly established French Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist) invited a Chinese student delegation to introduce the situation of the broad masses in various industries in China actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The league leaders told the Chinese delegation members that they pay great attention to organizing league members and youth to study Chairman Mao's works. Recently, they have been organizing youth to study "Opposing Book Worship," requiring league members to pay attention to investigation and research, follow the mass line, go deep among the masses, and propagate and study among the workers and peasants. They also require league members to, according to Mao Zedong Thought, pay attention to linking theory with practice, be modest and prudent, and guard against arrogance and impatience.

A Guide to Analyzing Problems

The University Students' Branch of the France-China Friendship Association has long organized several study groups for Chairman Mao's works. Recently, they held a study and discussion meeting on "On Protracted War" with the participation of more than 80 people. The speakers at the meeting all emphasized using the views of this brilliant work by Chairman Mao to analyze the situation of the national liberation wars of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially the anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people. They pointed out that the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people have made the U.S. imperialists, who possess various modern war tools, at a loss, which most powerfully proves the invincible might of Chairman Mao's people's war thought.

At present, among the revolutionary youth in France, some of Chairman Mao's famous sayings, such as "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing," and "In strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously," have become their constant guide to analyzing and understanding problems.

    法国革命群众如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作
    把毛泽东思想学到手，运用到斗争中去
    他们重视理论联系实际，用毛主席的观点分析问题
    法国进步群众无比珍爱毛主席著作，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，他们热望把毛泽东思想学到手，作为自己进行斗争的思想武器。
    渴望得到毛主席著作
    自从中国无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开展以来，毛主席著作在法国经常处于供不应求的情况。
    巴黎一家销售中国书刊的书店的负责人告诉记者说，他的书店最近每月销售毛主席著作和中国其他书刊的数量，等于去年上半年平均每月销售量的三倍。
    《毛主席语录》法文版，更是受到热烈欢迎，人们亲切地把它称为“小红书”。有些外省的工人、学生团体买不到《毛主席语录》，就派代表到巴黎来向中国朋友索取。法国的一个中学的一个班派了代表索要四十二本，因为全班同学每人都想得到一本。
    反修斗争的武器
    里尔的六个法共工人老党员，由于反对修正主义，去年年底退出了法共。他们的代表在巴黎得到一本《毛主席语录》以后，严肃地说，这是他们反修斗争的武器，是对他们的最大支持。有了毛泽东思想，他们就能更好地斗争。小学教员奥布兰夫妇收到朋友寄给他们的一本《毛主席语录》后在复信中说：“我们是怀着非常激动的心情收到这本书的。它的价值尤其珍贵，因为我们把毛主席看作我们时代的列宁。……这本书在人民中国是每个红卫兵的至宝，我们将永远认真地读它，并且按照书中无比珍贵的教导去加以应用。”一位法国青年在得到了一本《毛主席语录》以后，来信说：“我要经常、反复学习伟大的毛泽东思想，许多观点一定要背下来。”按照毛泽东思想办事
    法国马克思列宁主义组织和进步青年组织十分重视学习毛泽东思想。法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）机关报《新人道报》一再号召它的成员学习毛主席著作。去年十二月八日它刊载的一篇文章号召“学习毛泽东思想，按毛泽东思想办事”。文章说：“对待毛泽东思想的态度，是判断一个人是真革命者还是假革命者，是马克思列宁主义者还是修正主义者的标准。”
    新成立的法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）的几位领导人曾经邀请中国学生代表团向他们介绍中国各行各业广大群众活学活用毛主席著作的情况。
    联盟领导人对中国代表团员说，他们十分注意组织盟员和青年学习毛主席著作；最近他们正组织青年学习《反对本本主义》，要求盟员注意调查研究，走群众路线，深入到群众中去，向工农群众宣传和学习。他们还要求盟员，根据毛泽东思想，注意理论联系实际，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁。
    分析问题的指针
    法中友好协会大学生分会早就组织了好几个毛主席著作学习小组。最近，他们召开了一次有八十多人参加的《论持久战》学习讨论会。会上发言的人都着重运用毛主席这一光辉著作的观点，分析亚非拉国家人民的解放战争、尤其是越南人民抗美救国战争的形势。他们指出，越南人民的光辉胜利，使拥有各种现代战争工具的美帝国主义一筹莫展，这最有力地证明了毛主席的人民战争思想的无比威力。
    目前，在法国革命青年当中，毛主席的一些名言，例如“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”等已经成为他们经常用来分析问题、认识问题的指针。新华社记者
