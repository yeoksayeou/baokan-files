The Pakistani working people have an unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They praise Chairman Mao as the sun in their hearts and the most outstanding revolutionary.

A worker from a factory in Pakistan told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "After reading Chairman Mao's works, I wrote in my diary with great enthusiasm that Mao Zedong is the red sun in our hearts. His works are the rays of the sun. Our era is a great historical era. Its greatness lies in the fact that there is the most outstanding revolutionary Mao Zedong."

He wrote: "After the death of Stalin, the revisionist leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union created splits in the world revolutionary movement, betraying the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. Today, all this has been fully exposed."

"After reading 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' I came to the conclusion: the most fortunate thing is that, despite the great difficulties created by modern revisionists, we still have the conditions to make our revolutionary cause advance along the correct line and the correct path."

"The most important thing is to print Mao Zedong's works in various languages of the world, so that these works can be delivered to the people as soon as possible. If this important and fundamental task can be accomplished, workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, women, and all upright people in the world will be able to master the great Mao Zedong Thought. They will definitely be able to bury the American imperialist bandit leaders and their running dogs and accomplices, the modern revisionists, in various parts of the world."

The diary wrote: "The boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong's works will definitely dispel the deep darkness and the anti-people ghosts of the reactionaries and modern revisionists. The light of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely illuminate the whole world."

A textile worker in Karachi loves the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In a letter to the Xinhua News Agency's Karachi branch, he said: "My neighbor is a student at a local college. He has a red 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' After he translated a few quotations for me, these quotations gave me great courage and encouragement."

He said, "I began to understand that we should seek truth from this book. My colleagues and I all think that Chairman Mao's articles are true and clear. We all agree that this 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' should also be published in our Urdu language, so that we can also carry one in our pockets. Whenever we have questions, we can open this book to seek answers and solve our problems."

A sailor from Karachi obtained a Chairman Mao badge from a Chinese friend, and his friends all envied him. Once he lent this Chairman Mao badge to a friend for a few days. Soon, the sailor received an order to set sail the next day, but since his friend was not at home, he could not immediately get back his badge. So, he immediately went to his Chinese friend and asked for another Chairman Mao badge.

He said: "I love the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. We will never forget the help and support given by the Chinese people to Pakistan during the Indian armed invasion. During my overseas voyage, I must wear a Chairman Mao badge on my chest, so that the people of the countries I visit can see the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong." When he obtained another Chairman Mao badge from his Chinese friend, he felt extremely happy.

    巴基斯坦劳动人民赞颂毛主席是我们时代最杰出的革命家
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想一定会照亮全世界
    各国革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想就一定能埋葬帝修反
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十一日电　巴基斯坦劳动人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们称颂毛主席是他们心中的太阳，是最杰出的革命家。
    巴基斯坦的一位工厂职员对新华社记者说，他在读了毛主席著作以后，在日记里热情地写道，毛泽东是我们心中的红太阳。他的著作就是太阳的光芒。我们的时代是伟大的历史时代。它的伟大在于有“最杰出的革命家毛泽东。”
    他写道：在斯大林逝世以后，苏联共产党修正主义领导集团在世界革命运动中制造分裂，背叛马克思列宁主义的基本原则，今天，这一切已经昭然若揭了。
      “我在读了毛泽东选集之后得出了这样的结论：最幸运的是，尽管现代修正主义者制造了很大的困难，但是我们仍然有条件使我们的革命事业沿着正确的路线和正确的道路前进。
      “最最重要的是，应该用世界上的各种文字大力印行毛泽东著作，以便这些著作能够尽快地送到老百姓的手中。如果这个重要的和基本的任务能够完成，世界各国的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、妇女和一切正直的人们都能掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，他们一定能够埋葬美帝国主义强盗头子及其在世界各地的走狗和它们的同谋者现代修正主义。”
    日记中写道：“毛泽东著作的无限光辉一定会驱散深沉的黑暗以及反动派和现代修正主义的反人民的魔影，毛泽东思想的光芒一定会照亮全世界。”
    卡拉奇一位纺织工人热爱《毛主席语录》。他在写给新华社拉瓦尔品第分社的信中说：我的邻居是本地一所学院的学生。他有一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。当他翻译了其中的几条语录给我听以后，这些语录给了我巨大的勇气和鼓舞。
    他说，我开始懂得，我们应当从这本书中寻求真理。我和我的伙伴们都认为，毛泽东主席的文章写得真实明确。我们一致认为，“这本《毛主席语录》也应当用我们的乌尔都文出版，这样我们口袋里也可以装一本，一旦有不懂的问题，我们就可以打开这本书请教，解决我们的问题。”
    卡拉奇的一名海员从中国朋友那里得到了一枚毛主席像章，他的朋友们都非常羡慕他。有一次他把这枚毛主席像章借给了他的一位朋友别几天。不久，这位海员接到了次日远航的命令，但是，由于他的朋友不在家，他不能马上要回他的像章。于是，他立刻到他的中国朋友那里去，要求再给他一枚像章。
    他说：“我热爱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，我们永远不会忘记中国人民在印度武装入侵期间给予巴基斯坦的帮助和支持。我出国航行期间胸前一定要别一枚毛主席像章，这样，我所到的国家的人民就能看到中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东。”当他从中国朋友那里得到了另一枚毛主席像章时，他感到无比的幸福。
