Albanian comrades visited the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and Artillery units. Comrade Baluku praised the Chinese military as a force that staunchly defends Mao Zedong Thought and is unyieldingly loyal to the Party.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on February 2, Bekir Baluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, Vice Premier of the Council of Ministers, and Minister of Defense, along with Hito Chako, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, led an Albanian military delegation to visit the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and Artillery units.

Comrade Baluku and his delegation, accompanied by Yang Chengwu, a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, visited the Air Force unit. They were warmly welcomed by Tan Jiashu, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, and the officers and soldiers of the unit.

Comrade Baluku and his delegation participated in a study session on Mao Zedong's works led by the pilots. During the session, an active learner of Mao Zedong's works used vivid examples to illustrate the correctness of the instructions by our great leader Mao Zedong's closest comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, that the best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought, and the greatest combat effectiveness comes from those armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death. Their speeches were highly praised by Comrade Baluku.

Today, the unit also held a welcoming ceremony for the Albanian military delegation. The officers and soldiers read aloud two passages from Chairman Mao's message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor: "'Though mountains and rivers separate us, our hearts are as close as neighbors.' The hearts of the peoples of China and Albania are united, no matter how far apart we are.…” “Believe me, no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will stand together, fight together, and win together.”

After the unit's responsible comrade spoke, Comrade Baluku addressed the welcoming ceremony. He highly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao, as a force that actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, is unyieldingly loyal to the Party and the people's interests, defends Mao Zedong Thought, and is a powerful force.

Comrade Baluku gave high praise to the Air Force unit for its insistence on class education and the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He said, "You have truly implemented the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong. Pilots are first and foremost proletarian pilots, pilots who emphasize proletarian politics. You bring Mao Zedong Thought to the blue sky, and you will fly higher, faster, and better, defeating all enemies."

When discussing the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Comrade Baluku said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is a broad mass movement. It is guided by the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, sweeping away bourgeois old ideas and habits, and shattering the dreams of imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries to restore revisionism and capitalism in China. The enemies' attacks and slanders against the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution only prove that the path of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is correct."

Comrade Chako and other Albanian comrades, accompanied by Wang Shousheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of Defense, and Song Chengzhi, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery, visited the Artillery unit. After Comrade Chako watched the continuous five-year "Four Good" platoon of the Artillery unit's Sixth Platoon conduct live-fire exercises, he delivered an enthusiastic speech to the officers and soldiers, praising the artillerymen for shooting well. He said, "You were able to hit the target with just a few shells because you implemented Chairman Mao's teachings and emphasized politics. You are the people's army, the revolutionary army, and you have a unique spiritual power. This power is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

    阿尔巴尼亚战友访问我空军部队和炮兵部队
    巴卢库同志赞扬我军是一支保卫毛泽东思想的无限忠于党的军队
    据新华社二日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团，今天分别参观访问了中国人民解放军空军某部和炮兵某部。
    巴卢库同志等由中共中央候补委员、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武等陪同，来到了空军某部，受到了中国人民解放军空军副司令员谭家述和这个部队的指战员的热烈欢迎。
    巴卢库同志等，在这里参加了飞行员们的学习毛主席著作讲用会。在讲用会上，学习毛主席著作积极分子用生动的事例，说明我们伟大领袖毛主席的最亲密战友林彪同志关于最好的武器是毛泽东思想，最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢不怕死这一指示的无比正确。他们的发言，得到了巴卢库同志的热情赞扬。
    今天，这个部队还举行了欢迎阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团大会。指战员们在大会上高声朗读毛主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会贺电中的两段话：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。……”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。” 
    在这个部队负责人致词以后，巴卢库同志在欢迎大会上讲话，他高度赞扬毛主席亲自缔造的中国人民解放军是一支活学活用毛主席著作的军队，是一支无限忠于党和忠于人民利益的军队，是一支保卫毛泽东思想的军队，是一支强大的军队。
    巴卢库同志对这个空军部队坚持阶级教育和开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，给了很高的评价。他说，你们真正执行了毛泽东同志的教导，飞行员首先是无产阶级的飞行员，是突出无产阶级政治的飞行员，你们把毛泽东思想带到蓝空，你们就能飞得更高，飞得更快，飞得更好，就会战胜一切敌人。
    巴卢库同志在谈到中国无产阶级文化革命时说，由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场广泛的群众性的革命运动。它是以毛泽东同志伟大的马克思列宁主义的思想为指针，荡涤资产阶级的旧思想，旧习惯，粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派企图在中国复辟修正主义和资本主义的美梦。敌人攻击和污蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命，正好证明了中国的无产阶级文化大革命的道路是正确的。
    恰科同志等阿尔巴尼亚战友们由中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声，中国人民解放军炮兵副司令员宋承志陪同，来到了炮兵部队某部参观，当恰科同志观看了连续五年被评为“四好连队”的炮兵某部六连实弹射击后，向指战员们发表了热情的讲话，赞扬炮兵们打得很好。他说，你们所以能用很少几发炮弹，就击中了目标，这是你们贯彻执行毛主席的教导，突出政治的结果。你们是人民的军队，革命的军队，你们有着特殊的精神力量，这种力量就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
