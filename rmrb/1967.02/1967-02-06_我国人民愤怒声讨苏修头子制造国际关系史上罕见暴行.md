The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, cannot be insulted! The blood debt of the Soviet revisionist authorities beating our diplomatic personnel must be settled!

The Chinese people angrily denounce the Soviet revisionist leaders for committing rare violations in international relations

Revolutionary masses in the capital surge to the Soviet Embassy to protest and demonstrate, angrily shouting: Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with Brezhnev! Down with Kosygin!

Revolutionary people across the country hold rallies, parades, and demonstrations, and warmly console our embassy personnel in the Soviet Union, highly praising their revolutionary spirit as excellent

New China News Agency, February 5th: "New accounts and old accounts must be settled, new grudges and old hatreds surge to the heart." The revolutionary masses of the capital, enraged by the new atrocities of the Soviet revisionists, today formed a vast procession and surged to the gates of the Soviet Embassy in China, angrily holding a protest demonstration. The broad revolutionary masses, united in their hatred of the enemy, strongly protested the Soviet revisionist authorities' brazen violation of international diplomatic customs, intrusion into our embassy territory, and open beating of our diplomatic personnel and journalists in a fascist atrocity.

Today, over 40,000 revolutionary workers in the capital held a conference to exchange experiences in the struggle for revolution, production, and seizure of power. After hearing the news of the Soviet revisionists' new horrifying anti-China atrocity, the workers were filled with indignation and shouted in unison: "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!" The conference unanimously passed a letter of protest to the Soviet Embassy in China. The letter pointed out that the blood debts owed by the Soviet revisionist authorities must be repaid! For any provocation, we will definitely retaliate and will not forgive. After the meeting, tens of thousands of revolutionary rebels, holding high the portraits of our greatest leader Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, shouting slogans, held a grand parade and demonstration.

Today, at the gates of the Soviet Embassy in China, the waves of anger surged, and the protest roars shook the heavens and the earth. Beijing Normal University's Jinggangshan Commune stated in its letter of protest: The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, following the suppression of our students in Europe on January 25th, again smashed and looted the news picture exhibition window in our embassy in the Soviet Union, creating a horrifying bloodshed incident. This shows that they fear the truth. However, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought cannot be blocked. Whoever opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely overthrow them. The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Agricultural University's Gardenization Branch School were filled with rage and rushed from over 50 miles away to the gates of the Soviet Embassy to post large-character protest slogans. They said: We Red Guards and revolutionary rebels will resolutely rebel against the small group of Soviet revisionist traitors. We will definitely carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end. The broadcasting car of the Red Flag Combat Team of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics issued a bold declaration to the Soviet Embassy: We are Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We will greatly rebel against imperialism! We will greatly rebel against revisionism! We will greatly rebel against all reactionaries at home and abroad! Our generation will participate in the great battle to bury imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries at home and abroad. The doomsday of the imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries at home and abroad is not far away! We will definitely fight alongside the Soviet people and the people of the world to plant the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought all over the globe!

The warriors of Beijing Petroleum Institute's Daqing Commune said, we firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, knowing that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. The Chinese people's resolve to fight against imperialism and revisionism has been firmly established and has never wavered. The new and old grudges against the Soviet revisionists, the Chinese people have all firmly recorded. This blood debt must be repaid by them in full! The letter of protest from Beijing Geological Institute's East is Red Commune pointed out: The more the Soviet revisionists brazenly oppose China, the more vile and despicable they are in opposing the Chinese people and the people of the world, the faster they will collapse and die. The Chinese people will not forgive you, the Soviet people will not forgive you, and the people of the world will not forgive you. Your doomsday is coming!

The broadcasting car of Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute's East is Red Commune protested against the Soviet revisionists from morning to night in both Chinese and Russian. They pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have repeatedly created bloody incidents and brazenly carried out anti-China activities. This fully proves that the Soviet revisionists are the number one accomplice of American imperialism and the mortal enemy of the people of all countries.

The revolutionary rebels of the capital's red farmers from Dayun Village, Daxing Commune, also came to the Soviet Embassy to protest and demonstrate. They said, we must warn the Soviet revisionist traitors: If the Soviet revisionists want to be tyrannical, the five hundred million Chinese farmers will definitely not agree. We farmers must rise up to rebel against you!

A group of overseas Chinese students from Beijing Foreign Language Institute said, our great proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution to thoroughly uproot revisionism, so the Soviet revisionist clique is terrified to death and frantically opposes China. Some overseas Chinese students who returned from Indonesia said, the Soviet revisionists have already degenerated into the same kind of goods as American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the enemy frantically opposes us, the more it proves that our great proletarian cultural revolution is excellent! We must dig deeper and cleaner the root that produces revisionism and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

A warrior from a middle school's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team said, the Soviet revisionists opposing the Chinese people is "flying into the fire and will surely perish!" We have the great leader Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We fear neither heaven nor earth, and we are even less afraid of you bunch of flies! Go ahead and cause trouble, the revolutionary people will smash you to pieces. The warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team sang their own composed song "Blood Debt Must Be Repaid" in front of the Soviet Embassy: "The Soviet revisionist clique, betraying Marxism-Leninism, bad, bad, bad! Hysterically anti-China, willingly serving as the dog of American imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique, disrupting the cultural revolution, bad, bad, bad! Irrationally smashing our embassy, blood debt must be repaid!"

New China News Agency, February 5th: The Soviet revisionist ruling clique openly violated international diplomatic customs, directing plainclothes agents and thugs to break into our embassy in the Soviet Union, smash and loot our embassy's news window, and beat our diplomatic personnel, deliberately creating another horrifying anti-China atrocity. This has aroused the great indignation of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary people across the country. People are filled with righteous indignation, expressing the strongest protest, and emphasizing that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's creation of this new bloody incident is a rare fascist barbaric behavior in international relations. For the Soviet leaders' brazen provocation, the seven hundred million Chinese people will definitely retaliate and will not forgive. The more evil deeds Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk do, the faster their complete collapse will come! The sooner, the better!

The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary people across the country also expressed warm consolation to all the comrades in our embassy in the Soviet Union, highly praising their excellent revolutionary spirit! Praising them for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, engaging in a tit-for-tat struggle with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and being truly loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought red diplomatic personnel.

The fascist atrocities of the Soviet authorities enraged the people of Heilongjiang Province, who are on the front line of anti-revisionism. This afternoon, tens of thousands of red rebels and military personnel in Harbin City held an indignant denunciation meeting in front of the Heilongjiang Provincial Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee. Representatives of the red rebels, military personnel, and the Beijing Three Commissions' Harbin Liaison Station spoke at the meeting. They sternly warned the Soviet leadership clique: Your frantic opposition to the Chinese people only proves your weakness and the approach of your doomsday. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely not forgive you, and the Soviet people will definitely not forgive you. History will mercilessly and severely punish you. In their speeches, they also highly praised the anti-revisionist warriors of our embassy in the Soviet Union, expressing their determination to learn from their spirit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice and engaging in a tit-for-tat struggle with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The meeting passed a telegram of protest against the Soviet fascist atrocities. The telegram said, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique hates and fears the great Mao Zedong Thought, hates and fears our great proletarian cultural revolution, but the great Soviet people will definitely, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with the help of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, carry out a great revolution, rebel against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, seize their power, and expel them from the door. The great sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely dispel the temporary dark clouds over the Soviet Union. The meeting ended with a grand protest parade and demonstration by the red rebels and military personnel.

The revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who closely watch the Soviet authorities' every move, were even more filled with anger upon hearing the news of the new Soviet atrocities. The revolutionary rebels of Xinjiang's No. 71 Cotton Textile Factory pointed out at a meeting: The Soviet leadership clique has repeatedly brazenly committed atrocities, which is a serious provocation against the Chinese people and fully exposes their fear of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the truth. The warriors of the Red Flag Revolutionary Rebel Team of Xinjiang Agricultural University said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the Soviet revisionists oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the higher we will hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end. The revolutionary rebel warriors also emphasized that Xinjiang is the front line of anti-revisionism. In the past, the Soviet leadership clique carried out various subversive and destructive activities here and suffered a humiliating failure. But they are not reconciled and are still trying to subvert and destroy. We are determined to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with all the red rebels, carry the cultural revolution to the end, build Xinjiang into an iron-like anti-revisionist fortress, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the sky of the country's anti-revisionist front line.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the No. 17 Cotton Mill, affiliated with the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, expressed great indignation at the Soviet ruling clique's brazen violation of international diplomatic customs and the use of barbaric fascist methods to create new bloody atrocities in our embassy in the Soviet Union. They said: The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with! We not only want to rebel against the small group of capital roaders in power within our party, to rebel against all ghosts and monsters in society, but also to rebel against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries! Whoever dares to oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely fight to the end. The little red guards of Shanghai highly praised the spirit of our embassy personnel in the Soviet Union, who fearlessly defended the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great dignity of our motherland with their blood. They said, the personnel of our embassy in the Soviet Union are indeed red diplomatic warriors trained by Chairman Mao. We, the little red guards of Shanghai, extend our warmest consolation and highest respect to them! The little revolutionaries pointed out that fifty years ago, the great Lenin pointed out to the proletariat of the world the road of the October Revolution to seize power by force. Today, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao personally cares for and supports the "January Revolution" of Shanghai, pointing out to the proletariat who have seized power the road to anti-revisionism and the consolidation of power. We, the little red guards of Shanghai, firmly believe that one day, the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought will shine all over the world. The red guards of Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad will take to the streets, root out Brezhnev, Kosygin, and all the big and small Khrushchev-like figures, and beat them to the ground!

The revolutionary masses in Xi'an, Chengdu, and other places condemned the anti-China atrocity events that followed one after another from Moscow. People emphasized that the Soviet leadership clique's frantic anti-China activities foreshadowed the imminent collapse of their fascist rule, and the red rebels of the Soviet Union will surely rise up to overthrow the Soviet leaders' throne in the Kremlin. In the Xi'an region, the broad proletarian revolutionary rebels took to the streets with indignant hearts to protest and demonstrate. People pointed out that the Soviet revisionists bullying us is absolutely unacceptable, and we must carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership clique to the end. The revolutionary rebels of the Xi'an region's industrial and mining enterprises' cultural revolution joint committee warned the Soviet leadership clique: The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be insulted, and you will not have a good ending. The Soviet ruling clique is extremely afraid of our great proletarian cultural revolution and the great invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They breathe in the same hole with imperialism, various reactionaries, frantically oppose China, communism, and the people, and repeatedly create bloody incidents. This fully exposes that their doomsday is fast approaching. Large-character protest slogans against the Soviet revisionists' new atrocities appeared all over the streets of Chengdu. The warriors of the Chengdu Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Brigade sternly pointed out that the Soviet ruling clique created a new bloody crime in our embassy, once again exposing the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists who insist on being enemies of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, fully exposing the weak essence of the Soviet revisionists' external strength and internal weakness, desperate struggle. We will not let them off, and blood debt must be repaid with blood.

When the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' new atrocities, they angrily shouted: "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Whoever opposes the Chinese people, we will definitely rebel against them!" The little red guards of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters in Wuhan said: The Soviet revisionists' repeated creation of bloody incidents fully proves that they fear the truth and fear the great Mao Zedong Thought. We must warn the Soviet ruling clique: The brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable by anyone. The Soviet revisionists' new atrocities will only further awaken the Soviet people, and the future Soviet Union will definitely be a revolutionary Soviet Union of the people. The revolutionary rebel workers of Wuhan's No. 1 Flour Mill said: The Soviet people must master Mao Zedong Thought, rise up to overthrow the Soviet ruling clique, rebel against them, and overthrow their rule. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought must be planted all over the Soviet Union and the world! The news of the Soviet revisionists directing thugs to break into our embassy and create fascist atrocities spread to Guangzhou, and protest slogans and big-character posters immediately appeared on the streets. Many revolutionary organizations called the newspaper to express their strong protest against the Soviet leadership clique. The little red guards of Guangzhou Red Flag Military School said: The influence of our great proletarian cultural revolution is unstoppable by any imperialism and modern revisionism, and their doomsday is fast approaching. The great Soviet people will definitely rise up to rebel against the Soviet ruling clique. The darkness of Moscow will soon pass, and dawn is just ahead.

    今天在苏联驻华使馆门前，怒潮澎湃，抗议的吼声震天动地。北京师范大学井冈山公社在抗议书中指出：苏修叛徒集团继一月二十五日镇压我国留欧学生之后，又在我驻苏使馆领土内砸坏和劫走新闻图片展览橱窗，制造骇人听闻的流血事件，这说明他们害怕真理。但是，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是封锁不住的。谁反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，我们就坚决打倒他。北京农业大学园林化分校的革命师生们怒火填胸，他们从五十多里外赶到苏联使馆门前，张贴抗议的大字标语。他们说：我们红卫兵和革命造反派，坚决要造苏修一小撮叛徒的反，我们一定要把反修斗争进行到底。北航红旗战斗队的广播车，冲着苏联使馆发出了中国红卫兵的豪言壮语：我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵，要大造帝国主义的反！大造修正主义的反！大造国内外一切反动派的反！我们这一代要参加埋葬帝国主义、修正主义和国内外一切反动派的伟大战斗。帝修反的末日不远了！我们一定要和苏联人民、世界人民一起战斗，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全球！
    北京石油学院大庆公社的战士说，我们牢记毛主席的教导，知道被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。中国人民反帝反修的决心早已下定了，从来没有一丝一毫的动摇。对苏修的新仇旧恨，中国人民都牢牢记在帐上，这笔笔血债一定要他们加倍偿还！北京地质学院东方红公社的抗议书上指出：苏修越是猖狂反华，越是卑鄙无耻地与中国人民和世界人民为敌，就垮台得越快，死亡得越早。中国人民饶不了你们，苏联人民饶不了你们，全世界人民也都饶不了你们。你们的末日快到了！

    北京外国语专科学校的一批归国华侨学生说，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是为了彻底铲除修正主义的大革命，因此苏修集团怕得要死，拚命反华。一些从印度尼西亚归来的华侨学生说，苏修已经堕落成和美帝国主义、印尼反动派一路的货色！我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人越是疯狂反对我们，越是证明我们无产阶级文化大革命好得很！我们就越是要把产生修正主义的根子挖深，挖净，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    一个中学的毛泽东思想宣传队的战士说，苏修反对中国人民，就是“飞蛾扑火必自亡”！我们有伟大的领袖毛主席，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，天不怕，地不怕，更不怕你们这群苍蝇！你们捣乱吧，革命人民必将把你们砸个稀巴烂。毛泽东思想宣传队的战士在苏修使馆门前，高唱他们自己编写的歌曲《血债一定要偿还》：“苏修集团，背叛马列主义，坏，坏，坏！歇斯底里大反华，甘当美帝的狗奴才。苏修集团，破坏文化大革命，坏，坏，坏！无理砸我大使馆，血债一定要偿还！”
    新华社五日讯　苏联修正主义统治集团公然破坏国际外交惯例，指使便衣特务和暴徒闯入我国驻苏联大使馆，砸坏并劫走我使馆新闻橱窗，殴打我外交工作人员，有计划地制造又一次骇人听闻的反华暴行，激起了我国各地革命造反派和革命人民极大的愤怒。人们义愤填膺，表示最强烈的抗议，并且强调指出，苏修统治集团制造这一新的流血事件，是国际关系史上罕见的法西斯野蛮行为。对于苏修头子们的猖狂挑衅，七亿中国人民一定要坚决还击，决不饶恕。勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流做的坏事越多，他们彻底垮台的日子就来得越快！越早！
    各地革命造反派和革命人民还对我驻苏使馆全体战友表示亲切慰问，热烈赞扬他们的革命精神好得很！赞扬他们活学活用毛主席著作，同苏修统治集团进行针锋相对的斗争，不愧为忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的红色外交工作人员。
    苏修当局的法西斯暴行，激怒了地处反修前哨的黑龙江省广大人民。今天下午，哈尔滨市数万名红色造反者和驻军指战员，在黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会门前，愤怒举行声讨大会。红色造反者代表、驻军战士和首都三司驻哈尔滨联络站的代表，先后在大会上讲话。他们严正警告苏修领导集团：你们疯狂地与中国人民为敌，只能证明你们虚弱，证明你们末日的来临。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民绝对饶恕不了你们，苏联人民也绝对饶恕不了你们，历史将无情地严厉惩罚你们。他们在讲话中还高度赞扬了我国驻苏大使馆的反修战士，表示学习他们活学活用毛主席著作，同苏修统治集团进行针锋相对斗争的革命精神。大会通过了抗议苏修法西斯暴行的通电。通电说，苏修统治集团如此仇恨、害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，仇恨、害怕我国的无产阶级文化大革命，但是，伟大的苏联人民一定会在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导下，在中国人民和世界革命人民的援助下，来一次大革命，造苏修统治集团的反，夺他们的权，专他们的政，把他们扫地出门。伟大的毛泽东思想的阳光，必将驱散暂时笼罩苏联上空的乌云。大会最后，红色造反者和驻军指战员，举行了声势浩大的抗议示威游行。
    密切注视着苏修当局一举一动的新疆各族革命群众，听到苏修新暴行的消息后，更是满腔怒火。新疆七一棉纺织厂的革命造反派工人举行集会时指出：苏修领导集团一再悍然行凶，这是对中国人民的严重挑衅，彻底暴露了他们惧怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，惧怕真理。新疆八一农学院红旗革命造反团的战士说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”苏修越是反对毛泽东思想，我们就越是要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。革命造反派战士还强调指出，新疆是反修前哨，过去，苏修领导集团在这里进行种种颠覆破坏活动，遭到了可耻的失败。但是他们并不死心，还在想方设法进行颠覆破坏。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同一切红色造反者联合起来，把文化大革命进行到底，把新疆建设成为钢铁般的反修堡垒，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远永远高高地飘扬在祖国的反修前哨上空。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部所属国棉十七厂革命造反派工人，对于苏修统治集团公然破坏国际外交惯例，采取野蛮的法西斯手段，在我驻苏使馆制造新的血腥暴行，表示极大的愤慨。他们说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不是好惹的！我们不但要造我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，要造社会上一切牛鬼蛇神的反，而且要造帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反！谁胆敢反对马列主义、毛泽东思想，我们就要坚决斗争到底。上海红卫兵小将热情赞扬我国驻苏使馆工作人员不畏强暴，用鲜血捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想、捍卫伟大祖国尊严的英雄气概。他们说，我国驻苏使馆的工作人员，不愧是毛主席教导出来的红色外交战士。我们上海红卫兵战士向他们致以最亲切的慰问和最崇高的敬礼！革命小将们指出，五十年前，伟大的列宁给全世界无产阶级指出了用暴力夺取政权的十月革命的道路。今天，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀、支持的上海“一月革命”，给夺得了政权的无产阶级指明了反修防修、巩固政权的道路。我们上海红卫兵战士坚信：总有一天，毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光会普照全世界，莫斯科的、列宁格勒的、斯大林格勒的红卫兵会走上街头，揪出勃列日涅夫、柯西金等大大小小的赫鲁晓夫式的人物，把他们打倒在地！
    西安、成都等地的革命群众，纷纷谴责从莫斯科接踵而来的反华暴行事件。人们强调指出，苏修领导集团的疯狂反华，预示着他们的法西斯统治摇摇欲坠，苏联的红色造反者必将奋起掀掉苏修头子在克里姆林宫的宝座。在西安地区，广大无产阶级革命造反者怀着激愤的心情上街示威游行。人们指出，苏修如此欺负我们，这是绝对不能容忍的，我们一定要把反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。西安地区工矿企业文革联合会的革命造反者们警告苏修领导集团说：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的，你们是不会有好下场的。苏修统治集团极端害怕我们这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，极端害怕伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，他们和帝国主义、各国反动派一个鼻孔出气，疯狂反华、反共、反人民，一次又一次地制造流血事件，这正暴露了他们的末日快要来临。成都街头到处贴出了抗议苏修反华新暴行的大标语。成都工人革命造反兵团的战士们严正指出，苏修统治集团在我大使馆制造新的血腥罪行，再一次暴露了苏修坚持与中国人民、世界革命人民为敌到底的叛徒嘴脸，充分暴露了苏修外强中干、垂死挣扎的虚弱本质。我们决不能放过他们，血债一定要用血来还。
    广州、武汉等地广大革命造反派和革命群众在强烈谴责苏修新暴行的时候，愤怒地高呼：“打倒苏修！”“谁和中国人民为敌就坚决造谁的反！”毛泽东思想红卫兵武汉地区革命造反司令部的小将们说：苏修如此丧心病狂地连续制造流血事件，完全说明了他们害怕真理，害怕伟大的毛泽东思想。我们要正告苏修统治集团：伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉是任何人都挡不住的。苏修的新暴行，只会更进一步唤起苏联人民的觉醒，未来的苏联必定是革命的苏联人民的。武汉第一面粉厂革命造反派工人说：苏联人民一定要掌握毛泽东思想，起来革苏修统治集团的命，造他们的反，推翻他们的统治。毛泽东思想伟大红旗一定要插遍全苏联，全世界！苏修指使暴徒闯入我使馆制造法西斯暴行的消息传到广州，街头上立即出现了抗议的大标语和大字报，许多革命组织打电话到报社，表达他们对苏修领导集团的强烈抗议。广州红旗战校的革命小将说：我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，是一切帝国主义、现代修正主义无法阻挡的，他们的末日快到了，伟大的苏联人民一定会起来造苏修统治集团的反，莫斯科的黑暗即将过去，曙光就在前头。
