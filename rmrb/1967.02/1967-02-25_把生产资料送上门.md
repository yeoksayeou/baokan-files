The beginning of spring has passed, and the busy spring plowing season is approaching. The current urgent task for our rural supply and marketing cooperatives is to respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to seize the revolution, promote production, and support spring plowing. Our region has had little rain since last autumn and no snow in the winter, leading to poor soil moisture conditions. Therefore, the tasks of drought resistance and spring plowing preparation are quite arduous, requiring us to make great efforts.

Recently, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "investigation is the solution to problems," we conducted a detailed survey in all 134 production teams of the commune regarding spring plowing production materials and drought resistance supplies. Based on the actual needs, we cleaned up the warehouses and organized the procurement of eight types of goods that were in short supply or had low stock. Subsequently, we organized teams for repairing and supplying drought resistance tools and spring plowing production materials, going to the fields and the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to repair farm tools and sell goods. For some old farm tools in the households that could still be used after repair, we helped them repair these instead of buying new ones. We also found a batch of usable tools and parts from the scrap iron we collected and supplied them to the peasants at a very low price, which was well-received by the peasants.

Currently, all production teams in Mucun Commune are conducting a thorough cleanup and repair of drought resistance and production tools to welcome the spring plowing production peak. The current situation of the cultural revolution in the countryside is very good, and the production situation is also very good. We have the confidence to do a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials this year, achieving a double victory in revolution and production.

    把生产资料送上门
    立春已过，繁忙的春耕生产即将到来。我们农村供销社当前刻不容缓的任务，就是要响应毛主席和党中央的号召，抓革命，促生产，支援春耕。我们专区从去年秋天以来雨水稀少，冬季无雪，墒情恶化，因此抗旱备耕等任务相当艰巨，需要我们作很大的努力。
    最近，我们按照毛主席“调查就是解决问题”的教导，深入到全公社一百三十四个生产队，对春耕生产资料和抗旱物资进行了详细的摸底，然后根据实际需要，清理了仓库，对八种缺门或者存量小的商品组织了进货。接着，我们就组织了抗旱工具、春耕生产资料供修小组，深入到地头和贫下中农家里，上门修理农具和卖货。社员家里有些旧农具，如果修理一下能用的，就帮他们修理，不买新的。我们还在收购的废铁里，找出了一批还能使用的工具和零件，以很低的价钱供应给社员，很受社员的欢迎。
    现在，穆村公社各生产队里，都在对抗旱、生产工具进行大清理，大修造，迎接春耕生产高潮。当前农村文化大革命的形势很好，生产形势也很好。我们有信心搞好今年农业生产资料的供应工作，实现革命和生产的双胜利。
