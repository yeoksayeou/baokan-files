Edition: 2

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory, following Chairman Mao's teachings of trusting the masses, relying on the masses, winning over the masses, and educating the masses, united with the broad revolutionary workers. They overthrew a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and drove out the work team that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Because they firmly grasped the direction of the struggle and the strategy of uniting with the majority, they awakened the majority of the Red Guards who had been deceived, causing them to join the Red Rebel Corps, thus strengthening the ranks of the revolutionary rebels. They resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," forming a powerful production leadership team, ensuring that production was never interrupted. Last year, the factory completed all production tasks ahead of schedule by 18 days, and this January, the production tasks were completed 8 days ahead of schedule.

Firmly Grasping the Direction of the Struggle

The factory's predecessor was a small handicraft cooperative. In 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, it obtained relatively complete mechanical equipment and began producing petroleum machinery parts. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led it down the path of pursuing profits alone. For example, last year in the first half of the year, they accepted 18 important orders from the Daqing Oilfield, but because the profits were small, they did not actively complete 15 of them. Again, last year at the beginning of the year, they signed a contract with a certain unit to process a batch of bridge bearings, stipulating that work would begin in March and be completed in July, but because the profits were small, they had not started work by July.

As soon as the Cultural Revolution began in the factory, Li Guoxiang, Liu Xuefeng, and other revolutionary rebel comrades immediately directed their attacks at this handful of capitalist-roaders, exposing and criticizing their crimes of leading the socialist factory astray. The workers also rose up to speak out, quickly igniting a wave of struggle.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Harbin Municipal Handicraft Management Bureau and the higher-level company, along with those stubbornly implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, were terrified of this situation and quickly sent in a work team, attempting to bring the movement under their control. The work team, upon arrival, colluded with the capitalist-roaders within the factory to attack the revolutionary masses, labeling the workers who were most active in exposing the "leadership" issues as "counter-revolutionaries." However, the revolutionary workers saw through their true colors and resolutely drove them out the door!

Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, the Party branch secretary and others who were capitalist-roaders within the factory attempted to instruct some uninformed people to organize a puppet mass organization—the Red Guards—to help them pass inspection. The Red Rebels saw through this and, seizing the initiative, established the "August 25th" Combat Team (later renamed the Red Rebel Corps) on August 25, before they could. Out of the factory's 270-plus workers, 170 joined this organization.

This Red Rebel Corps, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, recognized that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. They seized the leadership of the factory from top to bottom and firmly held it.

Paying Attention to Winning Over and Uniting with the Majority

During the process of seizing power and holding power, the Red Rebel Corps engaged in sharp struggles with the Red Guards. Initially, they did not pay attention to the strategy of struggle and did not differentiate between a handful of stubborn elements within the Red Guards and the majority of deceived workers, with poor results. Later, they understood from studying Chairman Mao's works that in handling the issue of the struggle between the two lines, one must achieve "both clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades." They analyzed the situation of the Red Guards and decided to first win over those who were uninformed but had the most influence to the revolutionary side.

At the end of November last year, a few people in the Red Guards, under the pretext of something, incited some uninformed Red Guards to abandon production and go to the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee to "report a case," causing a commotion for seven days and seven nights. The Red Rebel Corps discovered that four party members in the Red Guards did not go, knowing that they had disagreements with other Red Guards. Li Guoxiang then did ideological work with these four party members. Li Guoxiang felt during his conversation with them that to solve their ideological problems, he must break through "three barriers." These "three barriers" are: dispelling one doubt, solving one mystery, and recognizing one direction.

1. Dispelling one doubt is: They thought that the organization of the Red Rebel Corps was not pure and could not be joined.

Li Guoxiang explained: "Our Red Rebel Corps has nearly 200 people, and only two landlord's children with good performance have been admitted. One is a league member who has always performed well in the past and present. The other is also a person who has been tested in struggle. For example, as early as the study and application meeting of Chairman Mao's works in July last year, this young man used Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the Party branch secretary's crimes of promoting bad people and cultivating false models, exposing him so much that he trembled and was speechless." Through the explanation, these party members thought that such a young man with a fighting spirit should join the Red Rebel Corps.

2. Solving one mystery is: In past revolutionary struggles, why did the Communist Party members who always led the charge fall behind in this movement?

Li Guoxiang raised this question, immediately resonating with the party members.

An old party member who joined in 1946 said deeply: "I was wrong to rely on old experience. When you fought against the Party branch secretary, he said to us: 'This is a test of the party member's stance. If I am a black gang, would the higher authorities send me to be the secretary? The activities of party members should be united around the branch.' I saw that out of the 18 party members in the entire factory, except for the four in power, 12 were on the side of the Red Guards. I thought following the majority of party members would not be wrong. This is the 'slavery mentality' criticized by Chairman Mao." Another party member said: "The key problem this time is that personal desires are too heavy. It is not handled with revolutionary principles but with personal feelings. As a result, the branch leaders made mistakes, and we also made mistakes."

3. Recognizing one direction is: Which side, the Red Rebel Corps or the Red Guards, implemented Chairman Mao's correct line?

Li Guoxiang presented a large amount of facts, making these party members admit from the heart that the Red Rebel Corps represented the direction of the movement, truly fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and loyally implemented Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." The Red Guards went deeper and deeper into the wrong path, becoming a tool to protect bad people from passing inspection.

These four party members cleared their minds, withdrew from the Red Guards, and joined the Red Rebel Corps. The comrades of the Red Rebel Corps, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, correctly used the strategy of winning over and uniting with the majority, continuously strengthened their ranks, and forced the Red Guards to gradually collapse.

Arming the Leadership Core with Mao Zedong Thought

The backbone of the Red Rebel Corps continuously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in practical struggles, arming their minds.

In this factory, there was a so-called active element who often did "good deeds" for personal fame and profit. When the movement began, he was very "active," wanting to take the stage after overthrowing the person in charge of the general production schedule. The revolutionary workers saw through his soul and did not let him do it; the Red Rebel Corps also did not arrange a leadership position for him. Thus, he joined the Red Guards, and in the end, because he did not get any oil, he did not participate in any organization, exposing his tail of individualism nakedly.

The leadership core of the Red Rebel Corps took this "active element" as their negative example. They recognized that in this Cultural Revolution, they had to fight on two fronts, both overthrowing the capitalist-roaders within the Party and fighting against the personal desires of individualism. They often studied this quote from Chairman Mao during their meetings: "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not do bad deeds, and consistently benefit the broad masses..."

They also made some mistakes in the struggle. Once, they did not consult with the masses and sent seven people to Beijing to link up. This violated Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and the representatives sent were not entirely appropriate. Under the instigation of the Red Guards, more than 20 young people withdrew from the Red Rebel Corps. The leadership core of the Red Rebel Corps immediately held a meeting, studied Chairman Mao's quotes, and decided to convene a full corps meeting for self-criticism. Liu Xuefeng criticized his undemocratic style of work and asked everyone to handle it. Li Guoxiang, one of the representatives sent to Beijing, also deeply criticized his personal desires. Everyone was educated. The more than 20 young people who had withdrawn from the Red Rebel Corps also knew they had been instigated by bad people and returned.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they not only solved many complex problems but also strengthened their unity. On December 23 last year, due to the influence of economism in society, 50 people in the Red Rebel Corps demanded that the factory solve the issue of two years of supplementary wages. Li Guoxiang said: "No. We cannot kill others on one hand and put money in our own pockets on the other." Liu Xuefeng said: "You can elect four representatives, and I will go with you to the Labor Bureau to see how the higher authorities regulate it." (The central authorities stipulated that these issues should be uniformly handled in the later stage of the movement). In this way, Li Guoxiang said Liu Xuefeng was "rightist" and should not lead them to make trouble; Liu Xuefeng said Li Guoxiang was "oppressive" and would make things worse the more he pressed. Through debate, they found that both of their hearts were toward Chairman Mao and socialism, only the methods of handling were different. Thus, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings to use the method of the masses educating themselves, first doing ideological work with about 10 of these 50 people, then mobilizing this part to persuade and educate others, making everyone see clearly and resist the economism demon wind.

People's Spirits Greatly Liberated

Revolutionary workers said: "The shackles on our bodies have been smashed, and the great Mao Zedong Thought has armed us, producing boundless power to change the world." Starting from the first month after they seized the leadership from the capitalist-roaders (August last year), they immediately changed the factory's previous state of often failing to complete production tasks. In the past, the capitalist-roaders within the Party suppressed the bridge bearing task that had not been completed for more than four months; they made production preparations in August and started production in September. Members of the Red Rebel Corps, such as Kang Fuman, worked hard and innovated technology in a key process, increasing efficiency by six times. As a result, they completed the bridge bearing production task in just one month. In September, due to the rush production of bridge bearings, the mechanical parts processing work for Daqing was affected, and only 55% of the monthly tasks were completed by September 23. At this time, they held a rally, proposing the battle slogan: "Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, for every mechanical part produced for Daqing, it is an additional bullet for Daqing workers' 'overtake and modify' battle!" Each production team was full of spirit, reasonably arranging labor, and as a result, with astonishing speed, they completed all production tasks for September two days ahead of schedule.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only changed the production situation of this factory but, more importantly, cultivated, educated, and tempered a large number of workers. Previously, the 75 workers considered the most backward in the entire factory are now the most revolutionary and active forces. Young worker Gu Yongjiang, who was once scolded by the capitalist-roaders as a "hooligan," is now an active element in "grasp revolution, promote production." When the Red Guards left their production posts, he insisted on labor and did not leave the front line. He also used Chairman Mao's quotes and the spirit of the 15th issue of the Red Flag editorial to educate and win over some deceived class brothers, making them stand on the side of the revolution.

Management System: Old Destroyed, New Established

Previously, this factory implemented a three-level management system of factory director, workshop director, and production group leader. Now it is a two-level management system, from the production leadership team to the production group leader, directly from top to bottom, and democratically elected from bottom to top, removing unqualified people at any time. Practice has proven that the representatives elected by the workers are completely capable of managing the factory well. Among them, some are good at formulating production plans, some are good at production scheduling, and some are good at administrative management, managing the factory in an orderly manner.

Previously, the capitalist-roaders managed the factory through administrative commands and coercion, but now they manage the factory by mobilizing the masses to study the "Three Articles," eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and consciously become the masters of the factory. Previously, administrative leaders and Party branch leaders did not unite and schemed against each other; now, the revolutionary cadre and the production cadre work closely together. At the beginning, they also had the phenomenon of each doing their own thing, but later, through democratic debate, the revolutionary cadre also grasped production and worked alongside; the production cadre also grasped revolution and assisted in mobilizing the masses. They turned the phenomenon of each doing their own thing into a new situation of considering the overall situation, working together, and mutually supporting each other.

This factory has been completely reborn in the Cultural Revolution, with workers becoming the true masters of the factory. Mao Zedong Thought guides the souls of the rebels, and revolutionary spirit produces tremendous material force. They drew the following conclusion from revolutionary and production practice: Cultural Revolution is the prerequisite for the great development of production, and the great development of production is the inevitable result of the Cultural Revolution.

    在毛泽东思想的基础上团结大多数
    ——记哈尔滨石油机械配件厂红色造反者抓革命促生产的胜利斗争
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，哈尔滨石油机械配件厂红色造反团，按照毛主席的相信群众、依靠群众、争取群众、教育群众的教导，团结广大革命职工，斗倒了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，轰走了执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组。他们由于牢牢掌握了斗争的大方向和争取团结大多数的斗争策略，促使绝大部分受蒙蔽的赤卫队队员醒悟过来，加入了红色造反团，壮大了革命造反派的队伍。他们坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，组成了强有力的生产领导班子，保证了生产一时一刻也没有中断。去年全年的生产任务提前十八天保质保量全面完成，今年一月份的生产任务又提前八天完成。
    牢牢掌握斗争的大方向
    这个厂的前身是一个小手工业社，一九五八年大跃进中得到了比较完备的机械设备之后，生产石油机械配件。可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却把它引向单纯追逐利润的途径。比如去年上半年，他们接受了大庆油田的十八项重要定货，有十五项因为利润小，就不积极去完成。又如去年年初，他们与某单位签订合同，加工一批桥梁支座，规定三月份动工，七月份交货，也因为利润小，拖到七月份还未动工。
    工厂的文化大革命一开始，李国相、刘雪峰等革命造反派同志，立即把矛头指向这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，猛攻狠揭他们把社会主义工厂引向歧途的罪行。工人们也纷纷起来大鸣大放，很快掀起了斗争高潮。
    哈尔滨市手工业管理局和上级公司一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，对这个形势害怕得要死，赶忙派来了工作组，企图把运动纳入他们所设想的轨道。工作组一来就和厂内走资本主义道路的当权派勾结在一起，围攻革命群众，把揭发“领导”问题最积极的工人打成了“反革命”。但是，革命职工识破了他们的嘴脸，坚决地把他们轰出了大门！
    厂内走资本主义道路的党支部书记等见势不妙，企图指使一些不明真相的人，组织御用群众团体——赤卫队，保他们过关。红色造反者看透了这点，当机立断，于八月二十五日赶在他们前面成立了“八·二五”战斗队（后改红色造反团）。全厂二百七十多名职工，有一百七十多人加入了这个组织。
    这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色造反团，认识到革命的根本问题是政权问题。他们把工厂的领导大权，从下到上，夺在自己手里，并稳稳地掌握起来。
      注意争取团结大多数
    从夺权到掌权的过程中，红色造反团和赤卫队展开了尖锐的斗争。开始，他们没有注意斗争策略，没有区别对待赤卫队中一小撮顽固分子和大部分受蒙蔽的工人，效果不好。后来，他们从学习毛主席著作中懂得：在处理两条路线斗争的问题中，必须达到“既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。”他们分析了赤卫队的情况，决定把那些不明真相而又最有影响的人首先争取到革命派方面来。
    去年十一月底，赤卫队一小撮人借故煽动一些不明真相的赤卫队员放弃生产，到黑龙江省委“告状”，闹了七天七夜。造反团发现赤卫队中有四个党员没有去，知道他们和赤卫队其他人有意见分歧。李国相就向这四个党员做思想工作。李国相在和他们谈话中感到，要解决他们的思想问题，必须突破“三关”。这“三关”就是：破除一个怀疑，解开一个谜，认清一个方向。
    一、破除一个怀疑是：他们认为造反团的组织不纯，不能加入。
    李国相解释说：“我们造反团将近两百人，只吸收了两个表现好的地主子弟。一个是团员，过去和现在都表现很好。另一个，也是经过斗争考验的。例如早在去年七月的一次学习毛主席著作讲用会上，这个青年就运用毛泽东思想，当面批判了党支部书记重用坏人、培养假典型等罪行，揭得他浑身发抖，哑口无言。”通过解释，这些党员认为，有这种斗争精神的青年，是应该加入造反团的。
    二、解开一个谜是：在历次革命斗争中，一向冲锋陷阵的共产党员，为什么在这次运动中许多人都掉了队？
    李国相提出这个问题，立刻引起党员们的共鸣。
    一个一九四六年入党的老党员，深有所感地说：“我是靠老经验办事吃了亏。你们在斗党支部书记时，他就对我们说：‘这是考验党员立场的时候了。我要是黑帮，上级会派我来当书记？党员的活动，要团结在支部的周围。’我一看，全厂十八个党员，除四个当权派外，有十二个在赤卫队这边。我想跟多数党员走，没有错。这就是毛主席批评的那种‘奴隶主义’思想。”另一党员说：“这次掉队，关键的问题还是私心杂念太重。不是以革命原则来处理党员和组织的关系，而是以个人感情来处理这个问题。结果，支部领导人犯了错误，我们也犯了错误。”
    三、认清一个方向是：造反团和赤卫队究竟谁执行了毛主席的正确路线？
    李国相摆出大量事实，使这些党员从心里承认，造反团是代表了运动的大方向，真正斗了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，忠诚地执行了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示。赤卫队在错误的道路上越陷越深，成了保护坏人过关的工具。
    这四个党员打通了思想，退出了赤卫队，加入了造反团。红色造反团的同志，就是这样在毛泽东思想指引下，正确地运用争取团结大多数的斗争策略，不断壮大自己的队伍，迫使赤卫队逐渐垮台。
    用毛泽东思想武装领导核心
    红色造反团的骨干，在斗争实践中不断地活学活用毛主席著作，武装自己的头脑。
    这个厂，有个所谓积极分子，过去经常为了个人名利做些“好事”。这次运动开始，他非常“积极”，想在斗倒管生产总调度的当权派后，自己上台。革命职工看透他的灵魂，没让他干；造反团也没给他安排领导职务。于是他投靠赤卫队，最后由于没捞着什么油水，什么组织也不参加了，把个人主义的尾巴赤裸裸暴露出来。
    造反团的领导核心把这个“积极分子”作为自己的反面教员。他们认识到，在这次文化大革命中要展开两条战线的斗争，既要斗倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派，又要向个人主义的私心杂念开战。他们开会时经常学习毛主席这一条语录：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众……。”
    他们在斗争中也犯了一些错误。一次，他们没有和群众商量，派七个人到北京串连。这是违反毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的指示的，而且派的代表也不完全妥当。在赤卫队的挑拨下，有二十几个青年退出造反团。造反团的领导核心随即开会，学习毛主席语录，并决定召开全团大会，进行检查。刘雪峰检讨了自己办事不民主的作风，要求大家处理。李国相是去北京的代表之一，也沉痛地检查自己的私心杂念。大家都受到了教育。已经退出造反团的二十几个青年，也知道自己受了坏人挑拨，又回来了。
    他们在毛泽东思想指引下，既解决了许多复杂的问题，又增强了团结。去年十二月二十三日，由于社会上经济主义的影响，造反团中有五十个人向厂里要求解决两年的补助工资问题。李国相说：“不行。咱们不能一面革人家的命，一面往自己口袋里装钱。”刘雪峰却说：“你们可以选出四名代表，我和你们一块到劳动局去看看上级是怎样规定的。”（中央规定这些问题都要在运动后期统一处理）。这样一来，李国相说刘雪峰“右”，不应该领着他们去闹；刘雪峰说李国相是“压”，会越压越坏。经过辩论，他们发现彼此的心都是向着毛主席、向着社会主义的，只是处理方法不同。于是，他们按照毛主席的教导运用群众自己教育自己的方法，首先从这五十个人中做好十几个人的思想工作，然后动员这部分人去说服教育另一些人，使大家擦亮了眼睛，抵住了经济主义妖风。
    人的精神得到大解放
    革命职工说：“我们身上的枷锁被砸碎了，伟大的毛泽东思想把我们武装起来，就能产生出改天换地的无穷力量。”他们从走资本主义道路当权派手里夺过领导大权的头一个月（去年八月份）开始，就立即改变了工厂过去经常不能完成生产任务的状态。过去，党内走资本主义道路的当权派压了四个多月没完成的桥梁支座任务，他们在八月份作了生产准备，九月份就动工生产。造反团成员康福万等奋发图强，在一道关键工序上搞技术革新，提高工效六倍。结果，他们只用一个月时间就全部完成桥梁支座生产任务。九月份因突击生产桥梁支座，使大庆的机械配件加工工作受到影响，到九月二十三日才完成全月任务百分之五十五。这时他们召开誓师大会，提出了战斗口号：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为大庆多生产一个机械配件，就为大庆工人‘超美甩修’的战斗多增加一颗子弹！”各生产组意气风发，合理安排劳力，结果，以惊人的速度，提前两天全面完成了九月份的一切生产任务。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，不仅改变了这个工厂的生产面貌，更重要的是培养、教育、锻炼了大批的工人。以前，全厂所谓最落后的七十五名工人，现在都成了最革命、最活跃的力量。青年工人谷永江，过去被走资本主义道路的当权派骂为“痞子”；现在成了“抓革命，促生产”的积极分子。当赤卫队脱离生产岗位的时候，他坚持劳动不下火线。他还用毛主席语录和《红旗》十五期社论的精神，把一些受蒙骗的阶级兄弟教育争取过来，使他们站到了革命派方面。
      管理制度破旧立新
    过去这个厂实行厂长、工段长、生产组长三级管理。现在是两级管理，从生产领导班子到生产组长，一竿子到底，而且自下而上，民主选举，不称职的人随时撤掉。实践证明，工人选出的代表完全有能力管好工厂。他们当中，有人擅长制订生产计划，有人擅长生产调度，有人擅长行政管理，把工厂管理得有条不紊。
    过去走资本主义道路的当权派，靠行政命令和压服的办法来管理工厂，现在靠发动群众学习“老三篇”，破私立公，自觉做工厂主人的办法来管理工厂。过去的行政领导和党支部领导互不团结，勾心斗角；现在的革命班子和生产班子亲密协作。开始一段，他们也曾发生过各自为政的现象，后来经过民主辩论，革命班子，也抓生产，跟班劳动；生产班子，也抓革命，配合发动群众。他们把各自为政的现象，变成了顾全大局、同心协力互相支援的新气象。
    这个工厂已经在文化大革命运动中完全获得新生了，工人成了工厂真正的主人，毛泽东思想统帅造反者的灵魂，革命精神产生了巨大的物质力量。他们从革命和生产实践中得出这样一个结论：文化大革命是生产大发展的前提，生产大发展是文化大革命的必然结果。
