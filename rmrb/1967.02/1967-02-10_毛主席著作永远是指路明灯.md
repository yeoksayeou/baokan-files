Chairman Mao's works will forever be my guiding light, just as the sun illuminates the Earth. I will study and master your works diligently. We must achieve victory in the struggle of the oppressed peoples against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism.

The Chinese people will surely defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. Your victory is our victory. Victory will surely be ours, because truth is on our side.

As the great Chairman Mao has said: "The truth of Marxism-Leninism is on our side. The international proletariat is on our side. The oppressed nations and peoples are on our side. More than ninety percent of the world's people are on our side. Our friends are everywhere. We are not afraid of being isolated, and we will never be isolated. We are invincible. A handful of miserable anti-China, anti-Albania elements are doomed to failure."

    毛主席著作永远是指路明灯
    毛主席啊！您的著作将永远是我的指路明灯，就象普照地球的太阳一样。我将很好地学习和掌握您的著作。我们一定要取得被压迫人民对帝国主义、殖民主义和修正主义斗争的胜利。
    中国人民必将战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义。你们的胜利，就是我们的胜利。胜利一定属于我们，因为真理在我们一边。
    正如伟大的毛主席所说：“马克思列宁主义真理在我们一边。国际无产阶级在我们一边。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在我们一边。全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。我们不怕孤立，也绝不会孤立。我们是不可战胜的。一小撮反华、反阿尔巴尼亚的可怜虫，是注定要失败的。”
