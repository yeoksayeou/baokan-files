Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee calls on all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas to shoulder the glorious responsibility and, with the spirit of "seizing the day," vigorously promote the revolution and spring plowing.

The following is the full text of the "Order to Mobilize the Revolution, Promote Production, and Launch a Great Spring Plowing and Production Campaign" issued by the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee on February 20:

"The revolution and production" is the most sacred call from our dearest leader Chairman Mao to us. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, actively respond to it, resolutely carry it out, and implement it without any deviation. We must be both pioneers in the revolution and vanguards in production. We deeply understand that only by grasping the revolution can we promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and production; only by resolutely implementing the policy of "revolution and production" and striving to do well in production can we stand unshakable. Therefore, we poor and lower-middle peasants must bravely stand out, do well in the Cultural Revolution, and do well in spring plowing production, carrying two heavy burdens on our shoulders.

The "Lichun" (start of spring) has passed, and the agricultural season is extremely urgent. We must seize the opportunity and work hard on spring plowing and preparation with the spirit of "seizing the day." To this end, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee specially issues the order to mobilize the revolution, promote production, and launch a great spring plowing and production campaign:

1. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "revolution and production." While doing well in the Cultural Revolution, we must also do well in all production tasks and strive for a bumper harvest this year. It is wrong to focus only on the revolution without caring about production, or to focus only on production without engaging in the revolution. Spring production has already begun. The success or failure of spring production affects the year's harvest, the construction of the country, the lives of urban and rural people, the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution, and our support for the world revolution. Therefore, we must do well and not miss the opportunity or lose the season, which would harm production.

2. Revolutionary cadres at the county, district, commune, and production team levels must take responsibility, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. At the same time, they must hold their posts and contribute the greatest effort to the current production, taking charge of production arrangements, labor organization, and the lives of commune members. Cadres who have made general mistakes must stand up for the revolution, expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, seriously reflect, listen to criticism from the masses, and focus on the current production, striving to make amends in spring plowing production. If they are passive, shirk their duties, or even abandon their posts, that would be a mistake upon a mistake, and they will be severely punished.

3. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary rebels must spare no effort, both grasping the revolution and shouldering the glorious responsibility of the current production. Rural youths who have gone out for revolutionary activities must return to their original production teams to participate in agricultural production. All agricultural labor must not leave their posts at will and must ensure full attendance. All actions that hinder spring plowing and sowing are wrong.

4. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are the objects of dictatorship and must not be allowed to cause trouble. If they do cause trouble, disrupt the Cultural Revolution, and disrupt production, they must be firmly suppressed and punished according to law.

5. The current agricultural production must focus on the following tasks:

	1. Develop water conservancy and store water. "Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." We must fully mobilize the masses, be self-reliant, and use local materials to solve the difficulties in material supply, and carry out small-scale water conservancy projects like the "Zhou Nan Zhou Xi" style. Construction projects must be focused on and completed before the floods arrive. Materials, funds, and machinery needed for water conservancy construction must be supported by relevant units in accordance with the spirit of taking agriculture as the foundation and vigorously supporting agriculture.

	2. Immediately launch a mass campaign to accumulate and produce fertilizer, in accordance with the requirements of applying fertilizer for both small and large seasons. Mobilize the masses to use various effective methods to produce fertilizer. Chemical fertilizer production must complete the planned tasks, and relevant departments must do a good job in transportation to ensure that it is delivered to the communes before spring plowing to meet the needs of applying base fertilizer for the large season.

	3. Strengthen the management of small-season crops. Require all places to apply fertilizer at least once in the near future, preferably human and animal manure, which is both drought-resistant and fertile. This must be done to increase production.

	4. Spring afforestation must be carried out promptly. The work of logging and transporting timber must also be strengthened to complete the state's tasks as soon as possible.

	5. Preparation for plowing must focus on the following:

		(1) Implement this year's agricultural production plan;

		(2) Eliminate terraced fields and terraced soil as soon as possible;

		(3) Strengthen the cattle, especially the winter cattle, to reduce the phenomenon of cattle dying in winter. Teams lacking cattle must purchase them as soon as possible;

		(4) Do a good job in the adjustment, exchange, and transportation of seed surplus and deficit;

		(5) Relevant departments at all levels must do a good job in the supply of production materials, and rural "five craftsmen" must be organized to repair and manufacture agricultural tools. Production teams must also designate someone to be responsible for the repair and addition of agricultural tools;

		(6) Do a good job in tobacco seedling cultivation.

	6. Focus on distribution and the arrangement of commune members' lives. Distribution work must emphasize politics, do a good job from beginning to end, and firmly suppress the activities of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who incite the masses to divide accumulated funds, property, and eat everything up. Communes and production teams that are currently distributing or have not started distributing must fully mobilize the masses to rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to quickly do a good job. At the same time, the lives of all commune members must be fully arranged. The supply of grain to communes and production teams lacking grain must be done well.

What is important and what is not important, reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words are the most important. At this critical moment of the great proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the crucial moment of the power struggle of the revolutionary masses, and in the busy season of spring plowing, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, focus on the "use" of them, break down the "self" and establish the "public." We must remember Chairman Mao's great directive of "revolution and production" in our minds and implement it in our actions. We must make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for double victories in the Cultural Revolution and spring plowing production.

    贵州省革命委员会号召全省贫下中农和农村革命干部担负起光荣责任
    用“只争朝夕”精神大抓革命大闹春耕
    本报讯　贵州省革命委员会二十日发布《抓革命，促生产，掀起春耕生产大高潮的动员令》。全文如下：
    “抓革命，促生产”这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召。我们广大贫下中农积极响应，坚决执行，不折不扣地照办。我们既要做抓革命的闯将，又要做促生产的尖兵。我们深深懂得，只有抓好革命，才能促进人的思想革命化，才能搞好生产；只有坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，努力把生产搞好，我们才能立于不败之地。因此，我们贫下中农要勇敢地站出来，搞好文化大革命，搞好春耕生产，两副重担一肩挑。
      “立春”已过，农时季节已经非常紧迫，机不可失，时不再来。我们一定要用“只争朝夕”的精神，不失时机地，扎扎实实地抓好春耕备耕工作，在全省范围内掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产热潮。为此贵州省革命委员会特发布抓革命，促生产，掀起春耕生产大高潮的动员令：
    一、要坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在搞好文化大革命的同时，把各项生产搞好，争取今年来一个农业大丰收。只抓“革命”，不问生产，或只抓生产，不搞革命都是错误的。现在春季生产已经开始了。春季生产搞得好坏，关系到一年的收成，关系到国家的建设，关系到城乡人民的生活，关系到文化大革命能否顺利进行，关系到对世界革命的支援。因此，只准做好，不准贻误时机，错过季节，危害生产。
    二、县、区、社、队的革命干部，要负起责任来，要坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行坚决斗争，同时要坚守岗位，为当前的生产贡献最大的力量，把生产安排、劳力组织、社员生活都认真地抓起来。犯有一般错误的干部，要站起来革命，要揭发和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的罪行，要认真检讨，听取群众批评，要抓好当前生产，努力在春耕生产中将功补过。如果消极怠工或者竟至撒手不管，躺倒不干，那就是错上加错，就要受到严厉处分。
    三、广大贫下中农、革命造反派，都要全力以赴，既抓好革命，又要担负起当前生产的光荣责任。外出串连的农村青年，都要回到原生产大队参加农业生产。所有农业劳动力都不得随意离开生产岗位，要坚持出满勤。一切妨碍春耕春播的行为，都是错误的。
    四、地、富、反、坏、右分子是专政的对象，绝不许他们乱说乱动，如果乱说乱动，破坏文化大革命，破坏生产，就坚决镇压，依法惩办。
    五、当前的农业生产，主要抓好以下几项工作：
    1、兴修水利，蓄水保水。“水利是农业的命脉”。我们要充分发动群众，自力更生，就地取材，解决物资供应的困难，大搞开沟、挖塘、修建“舟南舟溪式”的小型水利工程。基建工程要确定重点进行突击，抢在洪水到来之前。水利建设必需的材料、资金和机器设备，有关单位应贯彻以农业为基础，大力支援农业的精神，作出自己的贡献，支持水利建设。
    2、立即开展一个群众性的积肥造肥运动，按照小季、大季施肥的要求，发动群众，采用各种行之有效的办法沤制肥料。化肥要按计划完成生产任务，有关部门应做好运输工作，保证在春耕前运到公社，赶上大季施底肥的需要。
    3、加强小季作物管理。要求各地在最近要普遍追一次肥，最好是人粪尿，既抗旱又肥田。硬是要做到这一点，才能提高产量。
    4、春季造林必须抓紧。木材的采伐集运工作也必须加强领导，及早完成国家任务。
    5、备耕工作，主要抓好：（1）落实今年的农业生产计划；（2）及早消灭板田板土；（3）复壮耕牛，加紧做好过冬耕牛的饲养管理工作，尽量减少耕牛倒冬现象的发生。缺乏耕牛的社队要及早添购；（4）做好良种的余缺调剂、串换和运送工作；
  （5）各级支农部门要作好生产资料供应工作，农村“五匠”要组织起来修制农具，生产队也要指定专人负责农具的修理和添置工作；（6）做好烤烟育苗工作。
    6、抓好分配和社员生活安排。分配工作必须突出政治，善始善终，切实做好。坚决打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑动群众分积累、分财产、分光吃光等破坏活动。正在搞分配的社队和未着手搞分配的社队要充分发动群众依靠贫下中农抓紧搞好。同时，要全面地安排好社员生活。缺粮社、队的粮食供应工作要切实做好。
    这重要，那重要，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话最重要。在当前轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的关键时刻，在春耕大忙的季节里，广大的贫下中农，广大的革命干部，就是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席的著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。把毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，记在脑子里，落实在行动上，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取文化大革命和春耕生产的双胜利。
