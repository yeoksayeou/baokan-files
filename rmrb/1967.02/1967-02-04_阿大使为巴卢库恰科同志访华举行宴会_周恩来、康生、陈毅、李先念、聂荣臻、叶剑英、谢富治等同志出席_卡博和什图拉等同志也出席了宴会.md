On the evening of February 3, Ambassador of Albania to China, Vasili Nataneli, held a banquet for the Albanian military delegation led by Politburo member and Deputy Premier and Minister of Defense of the Albanian Party of Labor, Bekir Baluku, and the Chief of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, Hito Qiake, who are visiting China.

Central and other responsible comrades Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Jiang Qing, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Wang Shusheng, and others were invited to attend the banquet.

Comrade Hisni Kapo, Politburo member and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, and Comrade Behar Shutula, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, also attended the banquet.

At the banquet filled with revolutionary friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania, Comrades Baluku and Ye Jianying spoke. Comrade Baluku said that he was extremely elated to see Chairman Mao's health today. This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and also the greatest happiness for the Albanian people and all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries in the world. He said that Chairman Mao's warm and friendly words to our Party, people, and our leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, his high evaluation, and sincere wishes deeply moved us and made us extremely happy. This will greatly encourage our Party and people to build socialism, continuously carry out the revolution, and fight against imperialism and modern revisionism. He, on behalf of the Albanian Party of Labor and people, wished Chairman Mao a long life and prosperity for the Chinese people, socialism, communism, and the world revolution.

Comrade Ye Jianying said that the Albanian military delegation's visit to our country further strengthened the revolutionary friendship and brotherly unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries. Your boundless respect for our great leader Chairman Mao, your high evaluation of the great Mao Zedong Thought, your enthusiastic praise for our great proletarian cultural revolution that is developing in depth, and your firm support for the revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses in our country have greatly encouraged us. This reflects the high Marxist-Leninist principles of the glorious Albanian Party of Labor led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and expresses the true proletarian internationalism of the brotherly Albanian people to the Chinese people.

Those invited to the banquet also included responsible comrades from various departments, military branches, and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, such as Peng Shaohui, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Yuan Ziqin, Zhang Xianyue, and others, as well as responsible comrades from relevant departments.

Comrade Baluku first spoke at the banquet. He said that everywhere we went, we were extremely pleased to see that today's Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, Red Guards, and the great Chinese people are united as one, rallying around the great, glorious leader Chairman Mao, arming themselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely pushing the proletarian cultural revolution forward.

Comrade Baluku said that the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong is the strongest revolutionary vanguard of the international communist movement that holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. The advancing People's Republic of China, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is now an impregnable fortress of the world revolution. Therefore, all Marxist-Leninists in the world are looking towards China, which is successfully carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution. They regard the cause and achievements of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution as their own cause and achievements.

Comrade Baluku said that people and revolutionaries all over the world regard Chairman Mao as a dear and outstanding leader, a great revolutionary who adheres to principles, adheres to the Marxist-Leninist line, and fights against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Khrushchev renegade clique in Moscow. He said that Comrade Mao Zedong has further developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism. At the present stage of the development of the world proletarian revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong has enriched the theory of scientific socialism with new and extremely important propositions.

Comrade Baluku highly praised China's proletarian cultural revolution in his speech. He said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has blocked the road for revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China, further enriched Marxism-Leninism, and provided experience for safeguarding and consolidating the victory of the socialist revolution and for the continuous development of the proletarian revolution.

Comrade Baluku said that for our Party and people, fully supporting the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is a major principle. He said that anyone who supports the bourgeois reactionary line of revisionism and attacks the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is a revisionist, a counter-revolutionary, an enemy of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, an enemy of our Party and people, and an enemy of all true Marxist-Leninists in the world.

Comrade Baluku highly evaluated the revolutionary construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the high ideological and political level, high combat readiness, spirit of self-sacrifice and selflessness, and proletarian internationalism unique to your army, which is armed with the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Mao Zedong, have greatly educated and inspired us. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful and loyal tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a glorious defender of the socialist revolution, a reliable bulwark for the victorious development of the proletarian cultural revolution, a guarantee for the great advance of China towards socialism and communism, and a strong backbone for all oppressed peoples in the world.

In his speech, Comrade Baluku introduced the brilliant victories achieved by the Albanian people in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, adhering to the revolutionary principle of self-reliance. He said that our people and army, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and are striving to realize the historic resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress. Our Party's Congress has opened up a brilliant prospect for building a socialist society in our country and for further revolutionizing national life.

Comrade Ye Jianying, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, spoke at the banquet. He first, on behalf of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao and his closest comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the most cordial greetings to the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the glorious Albanian Party of Labor, the brotherly Albanian people, and the Albanian people's army. He said that under the leadership of the glorious Albanian Party of Labor led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people and people's army have firmly held high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely fought against imperialism led by the United States and reactionaries in various countries, and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and achieved brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The heroic Albanian people and people's army's spirit of adhering to principles, fighting, fearlessness, and continuous revolution is an example for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to learn from.

Comrade Ye Jianying said that in the new stage of our country's proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary rebels are carrying out a great alliance and power seizure struggle. This is a great leap forward in our country's proletarian cultural revolution and a great innovation in the international communist movement. This is Chairman Mao's major development of the Marxist-Leninist theory on the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

He said that we, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to the great Mao Zedong Thought. In this fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely support and assist the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses. At the same time, we will also carry out the proletarian cultural revolution within the army thoroughly and completely, and better fulfill the glorious tasks given to us by our great commander Chairman Mao.

Comrade Ye Jianying said that the era we are in today is an era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory; an era when the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought shine brightly all over the world; an era when the world revolution is surging. The most arrogant and ferocious invader in history, U.S. imperialism, has already been surrounded by the people of the world. The days of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, are also not good. They are frantically colluding with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, madly opposing China, opposing Albania, and opposing all revolutionary peoples in the world, including the Soviet people. They have even committed two consecutive fascist atrocities of poisoning our students. This precisely shows that they are extremely weak and their days are numbered! They will definitely be thoroughly buried by the Soviet people with a revolutionary tradition!

Comrade Ye Jianying said that the revolutionary friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania is forged by Comrades Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha and has withstood the test of storms. It is indestructible by any enemy. As Chairman Mao said, "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." This great revolutionary friendship between us will continue to play its invincible and powerful fighting role in the future struggle against imperialism led by the United States and reactionaries in various countries, against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, in carrying out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in promoting the great struggle of the world people's revolution. The final victory will definitely be ours!

    新华社三日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利今晚为由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团访问我国举行宴会。

    在充满中阿两国人民和军队革命战斗友情的宴会上，巴卢库同志和叶剑英同志先后讲了话。巴卢库同志在谈到今天下午毛主席亲切接见代表团时说，我们为毛泽东主席身体健康而感到难以形容的欢欣鼓舞，这是中国人民的莫大幸福，也是阿尔巴尼亚人民和世界所有马克思列宁主义者和革命者的莫大幸福。他说，毛泽东主席对我们党、人民和我们的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志所说的热情友好的话，高度的评价以及真诚的祝愿，使我们深受感动，无限高兴。这将大大鼓舞我们党和我国人民建设社会主义、不断地进行革命，以及反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争。他代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民祝愿毛主席万寿无疆，造福于中国人民，造福于社会主义、共产主义和世界革命。叶剑英同志说，阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团这次访问我国，进一步增强了我们两国人民和两国军队的战斗友谊和兄弟团结。你们对于我们伟大的领袖毛主席的无限崇敬，对于伟大的毛泽东思想的崇高评价，对于正处在深入发展的我国无产阶级文化大革命的热情赞扬，对我国革命红卫兵和无产阶级革命造反派的坚决支持，使我们受到很大的鼓舞。这体现了以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党高度的马克思列宁主义的原则性，表达了兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民最大、最宝贵的、真正无产阶级国际主义的支持。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有中国人民解放军各总部、军种、兵种的负责人彭绍辉、李天佑、王新亭、袁子钦、张贤约等和有关方面的负责人。
    巴卢库同志首先在宴会上讲话，他在谈到这次访问中国的观感时说，我们所到之处，都极为高兴地看到，今天中国的工农兵和革命知识分子、红卫兵、全体伟大的中国人民，万众一心，团结在伟大、光荣的领袖毛泽东主席的周围，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进。
    巴卢库同志说，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，是高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的国际共产主义运动最强大的革命突击队。前进中的中华人民共和国，在毛泽东思想的指引下，现在是世界革命的坚不可摧的堡垒。因此，全世界一切马克思列宁主义者都向着正在圆满成功地进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国。他们把中国无产阶级文化大革命的事业和成就看成是自己的事业和成就。
    巴卢库同志说，全世界各国人民和革命者把毛主席看成是一位亲爱的、杰出的领袖，看成是一位坚持原则、坚持马克思列宁主义路线，坚持反对以美国为首的帝国主义、反对以莫斯科赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义斗争的伟大的革命家。他说，毛泽东同志进一步发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义。在世界无产阶级革命发展到现阶段的今天，毛泽东同志用新的、极为重要的论点丰富了科学社会主义理论。
    巴卢库同志在讲话中热烈赞扬我国的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命堵塞了修正主义和资本主义在中国复辟的道路，进一步丰富了马克思列宁主义科学，为维护和巩固社会主义革命胜利，为不断发展无产阶级革命提供了经验。
    巴卢库同志说，对我们党和人民来说，全力支持毛泽东主席所代表的马克思列宁主义的革命路线，是一个重大的原则问题。他说，谁支持修正主义的资产阶级反动路线，攻击以毛主席为代表的马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命路线，谁就是修正主义者，就是反革命，就是中华人民共和国和中国人民的敌人，就是我们党和我国人民的敌人，就是全世界一切真正的马克思列宁主义者的敌人。
    巴卢库同志高度评价中国人民解放军的革命化建设。他说，用毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的你们军队的高度思想和政治水平，高度的战斗素养，牺牲和忘我的精神，以及你们这支军队特有的无产阶级国际主义，都大大的教育和鼓舞了我们。他说，中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大的、忠实的工具，是社会主义革命的光荣捍卫者，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的可靠屏障，是伟大中国向社会主义和共产主义胜利进军的保证，是世界上一切被压迫人民的坚强后盾。
    巴卢库同志在讲话中介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，执行自力更生的革命原则，在社会主义建设中取得的光辉胜利。他说，我国人民和军队，在党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，鼓足革命干劲，空前热烈地为实现党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议而奋斗。我们党的这次代表大会为我国建成社会主义社会、为使国家生活进一步革命化开辟了光辉的前景。
    中共中央政治局委员、国防委员会副主席叶剑英在宴会上讲话。他首先代表我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席和他最亲密的战友林彪同志，代表中国人民解放军全体指战员向中国人民亲密的朋友、阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军表示最亲切的致意。他说，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军，坚定地高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，坚决同以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派，同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行英勇斗争，并在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了光辉的成就。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军，坚持原则，坚持斗争，无所畏惧和不断革命的精神，是中国人民和中国人民解放军学习的榜样。
    叶剑英同志在谈到我国当前的无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段，无产阶级革命造反派实行大联合展开夺权斗争时说，这是我国无产阶级文化大革命的一个新的飞跃，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的重大发展。
    他说，我们中国人民解放军，无限忠于毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想。在这场严峻的无产阶级同资产阶级的大搏斗中，我们一定高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，誓作保卫无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱，坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。同时，我们还要把军队本身的无产阶级文化大革命搞好，搞彻底，更好地完成我们伟大的统帅毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。
    叶剑英同志说，今天我们所处的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代；是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉普照全世界的时代，是世界革命风起云涌的时代。美帝国主义这个历史上最狂妄、最凶恶的侵略者，已经陷入了全世界人民的重重包围之中。美帝国主义的帮凶苏共修正主义领导集团的日子也很不好过。它加紧勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，疯狂地反对中国，反对阿尔巴尼亚，反对包括苏联人民在内的全世界革命人民，甚至接连两次制造毒打我国留学生的法西斯暴行事件。这正好说明它是极度虚弱的，它的寿命不会很长了！它终将被富有革命传统的苏联人民所彻底埋葬！
    叶剑英同志说，中阿两国人民和军队之间的战斗友谊，是由毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志共同缔造的，是经历过急风暴雨的考验的，是任何敌人也破坏不了的。正如毛主席所说的：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”我们之间的这种伟大的战斗友谊，在今后反对以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派，反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，在促进世界人民革命的伟大斗争中，必将继续发挥它无坚不摧的巨大的战斗威力！最后胜利一定是我们的！（附图片）
