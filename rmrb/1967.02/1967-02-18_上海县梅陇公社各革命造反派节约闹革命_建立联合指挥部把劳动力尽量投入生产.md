	Shanghai County's Meilong Commune's various revolutionary rebel factions, in response to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "save to make revolution," have, on the basis of great unity and great solidarity, streamlined their organizations, established a solid and powerful joint command center, and organized the labor force to the maximum extent to engage in production, thus greatly saving manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

	The thirty-two revolutionary rebel organizations in Meilong Commune, during the struggle for a full-scale seizure of power by the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, have achieved great unity and great solidarity. Based on the principles of close contact with the masses, insistence on production, and thrift, they have, through consultation, established a joint command center consisting of nine permanent members to lead the revolution and production of the entire commune. Various revolutionary organizations have either voluntarily reduced the number of permanent members who are detached from production, or have only set up non-detached liaison personnel, with all personnel originally concentrated in the commune returning to their respective production posts to engage in production.

	After the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs was launched, revolutionary rebel organizations of the agricultural, industrial, commercial, educational sectors, and cadres of various departments in Meilong Commune sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. They launched a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, as well as against the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, achieving great victories. However, due to the lack of a unified leadership, unified steps, and unified actions among the various revolutionary rebel organizations, everyone wanted to engage in criticism and struggle, convene mass meetings, mobilize manpower for propaganda activities, and organize production personnel. This led to some problems, such as too many organizational structures, too many redundant activities, too many detached personnel, wasting of manpower, and affecting production. In the course of the struggle, the various revolutionary rebels increasingly felt that, in order to better adapt to the needs of the full-scale seizure of power, to better implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and to better save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, it is necessary to achieve great unity and great solidarity under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unify thoughts, organizations, and actions.

	To solve this problem, the various revolutionary rebels held a joint meeting for full discussion. They believed that revolutionary rebels must have revolutionary thoughts and revolutionary organizational structures and must not simply copy the bureaucratic structures of the power-holders who took the capitalist road in the past. They said: We have seized power and must also hold power well; we have grown up in the mud and soil, and must forever be close to the poor and lower-middle peasants, forever be rooted in production labor, and forever remember to save to make revolution. Everyone realized that getting more people to participate in production labor and firmly guard their production posts is the greatest thrift. The meeting unanimously decided to establish a streamlined and solid organizational structure—a joint command center—to unify the organization and mobilization of revolutionary masses and shoulder the two heavy burdens of revolution and production in the entire commune.

	In leading production, the joint command center changed the bad habit of the bourgeoisie sitting in the office relying on reports, telephones, and meetings to listen to reports and issue orders. The personnel responsible for production directly went to the production front line, understood the production situation, listened to the opinions of the masses, and solved specific problems. The joint command center set up a liaison person in each of the thirteen production brigades in the commune, who is generally not detached from production, to communicate information between the upper and lower levels, unify the steps of the revolutionary rebels in various brigades, reduce the number of detached personnel in various brigades, and save a large amount of manpower. At the same time, they paid great attention to saving funds and decided that, except for necessary propaganda expenses, no non-production expenses would be spent.

	The good effects of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai County's Meilong Commune saving to make revolution have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	At present, they are working to solve the problem of further unifying the organizations of the grassroots revolutionary rebels so as to reduce the number of detached personnel to the maximum extent and save manpower; at the same time, the detached personnel of the commune and brigade revolutionary rebel organizations are actively striving to participate more in production labor, forever maintain the character of the working people, and revolutionize to the end.

    上海县梅陇公社各革命造反派节约闹革命
    建立联合指挥部把劳动力尽量投入生产
    据新华社上海电　上海县梅陇公社各革命造反派，响应我们伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，在大联合、大团结的基础上精兵简政，建立起扎实有力的联合指挥部，把劳动力最大限度地组织起来投入生产劳动，大大节约了人力、物力和财力。
    梅陇公社三十二个革命造反派组织在无产阶级革命左派全面开展大夺权的斗争中，实行了大联合、大团结。他们本着密切联系群众、坚持生产、勤俭节约的原则，通过协商，成立了由九个常设人员组成的联合指挥部，统一领导全公社的革命和生产。各个革命组织有的主动减少了脱离生产的常设人员；有的革命组织只设不脱产的联络员，原来集中在公社的人员都回到各自的生产岗位参加生产。
    上海郊区农村的无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃掀起之后，梅陇公社的农、工、商、学各条战线和机关干部的革命造反派组织，象雨后春笋般地建立起来。他们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，以及地富反坏右发起了总攻击，取得了很大的胜利。由于各革命造反派组织之间没有一个统一的领导，统一的步骤和统一的行动，大家都要搞批判斗争，召集群众大会，都要抽调人力进行宣传活动，都要组织抓生产的人员。这就带来了一些问题，如组织机构多，重复活动多，脱产人员多，造成劳动力的浪费，影响了生产。在斗争实践中，各革命造反派越来越体会到，为了更好地适应全面开展夺权斗争的需要，为了更好地贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，为了更好地节约人力、物力、财力，必须在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，实行大联合、大团结，统一思想、统一组织、统一行动。
    为了解决这个问题，各革命造反派召开联席会议，进行了充分讨论。大家认为，革命造反派要有革命的思想、革命的组织机构，绝不能照搬过去走资本主义道路的当权派所搞的那一套官僚机构。他们说：我们打下了天下，还要掌好权；我们从小泥里长、土里生，永远要同贫下中农心连心，永远要同生产劳动根连根，永远牢记节约闹革命。大家认识到，使更多的人参加生产劳动，坚守生产岗位，这是最大的勤俭节约。会议一致决定，建立一个精干、扎实的组织机构——联合指挥部，统一组织和发动革命群众，挑好全公社革命和生产两副重担。
    联合指挥部在领导生产的过程中，改变了过去资产阶级老爷坐在办公室里靠报表、电话、会议听取汇报和发号施令的坏作风，负责抓生产的人员直接深入生产第一线，了解生产情况，倾听群众意见，解决具体问题。联合指挥部在全公社十三个生产大队分别设立一名一般不脱产的联络员，沟通上下情况，统一各大队革命造反派的步调，减少了各大队的脱产人员，节约了大量的劳动力。同时，他们还十分注意经费的节约，决定除必要的宣传费用外，非生产费用一律不开支。
    上海县梅陇公社各革命造反组织节约闹革命的良好作用，受到广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    目前，他们正在着手解决各基层革命造反派进一步统一组织的问题，以便最大限度地减少脱产人员，节约劳力；同时，公社、大队造反派组织现有的脱产人员，积极争取多参加生产劳动，永远保持劳动人民的本色，革命到底。
