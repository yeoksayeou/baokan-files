Dare to Change the Heavens and Earth
— Recording the Revolutionary Deeds of the Revolutionary Rebel Workers of Chongqing Prospecting Machinery Factory in "Grasping the Revolution and Promoting Production"

The Geological Department's Chongqing Prospecting Machinery Factory is a medium-sized factory with only five or six hundred people. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary rebel workers, with the "Flame" Combat Team as the core, under the guidance of the brilliant and resplendent thoughts of Chairman Mao, resolutely fought against a handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road. They smashed the evil plots of this handful of reactionaries to obstruct the revolution, sabotage production, and resist Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." They defended the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, seized power from the power-holders who were taking the capitalist road, and took control of the fate of the revolution and production. The factory's revolution was well conducted, and production was excellent, presenting a thriving and vibrant scene.

Only heroes drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and tigers.

In June and July of last year, all revolutionary workers in the factory responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a high tide of the cultural revolution. Thousands of big-character posters, like a barrage, fiercely attacked a handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary torrent frightened these power-holders, who on the one hand claimed, "The seven members of the factory party committee are all first-class cadres," and on the other hand secretly organized thugs to incite mutual insults and attacks among the masses to achieve their evil scheme of shifting the target of struggle and splitting revolutionary forces. Under the pretext of "phased implementation" and "promoting production," they brutally suppressed the mass movement. Then, under the guise of "protecting the factory," they organized "worker patrol teams" to deceive some unaware masses to attack the revolutionary faction, attempting to extinguish the sparks of revolution. These reactionaries compiled black materials, made blacklists, distorted right and wrong, and confused black and white, imposing white terror on the revolutionary faction.

At this critical moment, the young rebels of the Dongfanghong Commune of Beijing Institute of Geology came to the factory to unite with the workers, spreading Mao Zedong Thought and igniting the sparks of revolution. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers of the factory broke through numerous obstacles and established their own revolutionary organization—the "Flame" Combat Team. From then on, a brand-new revolutionary situation emerged in Chongqing Prospecting Machinery Factory.

For the sake of sacrifice and great ambition, dare to change the heavens and earth.

Previously, a handful of power-holders within the factory who were taking the capitalist road believed that inland construction should be "four years of construction, three years of operation," and should be done "slowly." Since the factory started production in March last year, it has never completed the monthly plan, and the product quality has never passed inspection. Broad revolutionary workers felt very anxious and painful about this. However, those reactionaries said, "What's the rush?! Not completing the task won't kill anyone!"

In this movement, these people suddenly changed their tune, saying, "I don't mind being struggled against, but I'm afraid of not completing the task," attempting to use "promoting production" to suppress the revolution. In fact, they were not afraid of not completing the production task; they were afraid of losing their positions. When the revolutionary rebels launched a counterattack, they turned around and used "promoting the revolution" as an excuse to sabotage production, even refusing to hold daily scheduling meetings, causing many production problems to remain unsolved. These people also incited workers to go out in large numbers for "linking up," wasting a large amount of state funds; during the New Year, they used the excuse of visiting relatives to send a large number of key workers from the production front line away, causing many key machines and critical processes to be left unmanned and unmanaged, plunging the entire factory into a state of paralysis.

"The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we don't say it, who will? If we don't do it, who will?" Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary rebel workers found these schemes to suppress the revolution and sabotage production intolerable! The power-holders taking the capitalist road, get out of the way! We revolutionary workers will take charge! The great power of revolution and production must be in our own hands. If we don't seize it, who will? If we don't seize it now, when will we? On January 16, the "Flame" Combat Team and other revolutionary organizations jointly seized the power of the factory, and the revolutionary rebel workers bravely took on the responsibility of revolution and production.

The revolutionary rebel workers best understand Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," best listen to Chairman Mao's words, and best follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not avoid problems but will solve them with an active attitude. Any human difficulty can be overcome." They understand that only by doing a good job in the revolution and striving to complete production tasks can we effectively further consolidate our proletarian iron-clad mountains and rivers.

To catch up with production, the "Flame" Combat Team held a "grasping the revolution and promoting production" symposium with the participation of 53 old workers and production backbones the day after seizing power. They proposed many constructive opinions on how to grasp the revolution and promote production. Then, they established a "Revolutionary Production Preparatory Committee" composed of representatives from various revolutionary organizations to unify the command of the factory's revolution and production.

Once the revolutionary rebel workers took control of their own destiny, they immediately and unhesitatingly took on the responsibility of revolution and production. They made the greatest efforts to fully mobilize all positive factors, carried forward the spirit of bravely fighting, fearing no sacrifice, and continuous combat, and overcame the serious shortage of personnel and other difficulties left by the power-holders taking the capitalist road. With a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, the broad revolutionary rebel workers threw themselves into production with ardent revolutionary enthusiasm. The heat treatment high-frequency worker left, and the electrician took over; the milling machine worker left, and the planer worker took over; the grinder left, and the lathe worker took over; the master left, and the apprentice took over. When there were not enough workers, the cadres took over. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome any difficulty! The young worker Zhang Yi in the pump workshop, in the absence of experienced foremen, stepped forward and worked for three consecutive days, each shift lasting 12 hours, breaking through the key process of grinding the internal hole of the gear, which had not been completed for a long time in the past. The rebel workers deeply understood that sleep can be forgone, and food can be forgone, but revolutionary will cannot be shaken! The workers Zhou Ke Liang and He Bin Hao in the gear workshop controlled four machines each, completing 56 hours of work in one day.

The revolutionary rebels are not only pioneers in the revolution but also innovators in production. After seizing power, the revolutionary rebel workers broke through one technical difficulty after another. The foreman Xu Jiaobao in the forging and pressing workshop took the initiative to undertake the task of manually operated pump bending pipes, which had not been solved in the factory before. The gear workshop had low equipment capacity, and there were many problems in completing the tasks. The old worker Han Zhengxin and the young worker You Linsheng, with sky-high enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility as masters, broke away from superstitions, dared to think and act, improved the machine, doubled the work efficiency, and broke through a key process.

The revolutionary comrades always remember Chairman Mao's repeated instructions: "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." Many worker foremen faced difficulties head-on, took on heavy tasks, and said: "No matter how big the difficulties are, they are not bigger than the loyal hearts of the revolutionary rebel workers to Chairman Mao." Under the leadership of the "Revolutionary Production Preparatory Committee," the revolutionary rebels grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production, composing another moving song of victory in the mountain city!

By 10:00 AM on January 31, the factory had completed the production tasks for January in excess of the plan, creating a new record of the highest monthly output and the best results since the factory was established.

The iron pass is like iron, but now we step forward from the beginning.

In the past, the plan was not completed month after month, and the product batches did not pass inspection. Now, not only has the plan been completed in excess, but many technical difficulties have also been overcome. In just one month, such earth-shaking changes have taken place in this not-so-large factory. What is the reason? It is the revolution, the great proletarian cultural revolution, and the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought taking control of their own destiny. Under the inspiration of the proletarian cultural revolution, the broad revolutionary workers have shown revolutionary wisdom that was unimaginable in the past. Ultimately, it is the great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production." At the symposium, the comrades of the "Flame" Combat Team said:

"We workers have ambition. Those power-holders taking the capitalist road don't do it, let them roll away! They don't do it, we will! We will do it better!

"Chairman Mao cares so much about our inland construction. We, the revolutionary rebel workers, have Chairman Mao backing us up. We must make Chairman Mao proud!

"We workers have taken charge and become masters. The revolution must be launched, and production must be promoted. We must make the revolutionary rebels in the entire mountain city and throughout China proud!"

The wind and thunder move, the banners wave, and the dust settles. Once the revolutionary rebels seize power and kick out the power-holders taking the capitalist road, they will create miracles and shake the heavens and earth!

"Many things have always been urgent; the world turns, and time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." The revolutionary rebel workers of Chongqing Prospecting Machinery Factory, with the greatest revolutionary spirit, raised the great red flag of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, launching a fierce counterattack against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production." Listen! This is the bold and heroic language of the revolutionary rebels of the mountain city prospecting machinery factory:

"Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, we dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire, we swear to trample the bourgeoisie under our feet, we swear to shoulder the production tasks, we swear to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end! We will not rest until we achieve complete victory!"

    敢教日月换新天
    ——记重庆探矿机械厂革命造反派工人“抓革命，促生产”的动人事迹
    地质部重庆探矿机械厂，是个只有五六百人的中型工厂。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，以“烈火”战斗队为核心的革命造反派工人，在伟大的光芒万丈的毛泽东思想指导下，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作坚决斗争，粉碎了一小撮反动家伙阻挠革命、破坏生产、对抗毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针等罪恶阴谋，捍卫了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权，自己掌握了革命和生产的命运。这个厂革命抓得好，生产搞得出色，呈现了一派欣欣向荣、生气勃勃的大好局面。
    独有英雄驱虎豹　更无豪杰怕熊罴
    去年六七月间，全厂革命职工热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了文化大革命高潮。数以千计的大字报，象排炮一样狠狠地打向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。革命的滚滚洪流吓慌了厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们一面扬言“厂党委七个委员都是一类干部”，一面又暗中组织打手，挑动群众之间互相谩骂和攻击，来达到他们转移斗争目标，分化革命力量的罪恶勾当。他们以“分期分批”为借口，以“促生产”为幌子，把群众运动残酷地镇压下去。接着他们又以“护厂”为名，组织“工人纠察队”，蒙蔽一部分不明真相的群众，来围攻革命派，妄图扑灭星星之火。这些反动家伙，编黑材料，列黑名单，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，对革命派实行白色恐怖。
    正在这关键的时刻，北京地质学院东方红公社的小将们来厂同工人结合，宣传毛泽东思想，点燃了革命火种。工厂革命职工在毛泽东思想指导下，冲破重重障碍，建立了自己的革命组织——“烈火”战斗队。从此，一个崭新的革命局面重新出现在重庆探矿机械厂。
    为有牺牲多壮志　敢教日月换新天
    过去，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派认为，内地建设要“四年基建，三年上马”，要“慢慢来”。从去年三月建厂开工生产以来，就是月月完不成计划，产品质量批批过不了关。广大革命职工对此感到非常着急，非常痛心。可是那些反动家伙却说：“急什么？！完不成任务，又不会死人！”
    在这次运动中，这些家伙却又一反常态，说什么“自己挨斗倒不怕，就怕完不成任务”，妄图用“抓生产”来压革命。其实，他们哪里是怕完不成生产任务，他们怕的是丢掉乌纱帽。当革命造反派起来展开针锋相对的斗争时，他们反过来又以“抓革命”为名来破坏生产，甚至连日常调度会也不开，使大量生产问题不能得到解决。这些家伙还煽动工人大量外出串连，大量挥霍国家资金；新年期间又以探亲为名，大量放走生产第一线的骨干工人，造成许多关键机床、要害工序无人操作，无人管理，使全厂生产陷入瘫痪状态。
    “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派工人，对于这压制革命、破坏生产的种种阴谋诡计，是可忍，孰不可忍！走资本主义道路的当权派滚开，我们革命工人自己来！革命生产的大权必须掌握在自己手中，这个权，我们不夺，谁夺？现在不夺，更待何时？一月十六日，“烈火”战斗队等革命组织联合夺回了工厂的大权，革命造反派工人勇敢地挑起了革命和生产的重担。
    革命造反派的工人最领会毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，最听毛主席的话，最遵循毛主席的教导：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”他们懂得，只有搞好革命，努力完成生产任务，才能有效地进一步巩固我们无产阶级铁打的江山。
    为了把生产赶上去，“烈火”战斗队在夺权的第二天，立即召开了有五十三名老工人、生产骨干参加的“抓革命，促生产”的座谈会。他们提出了许多抓好革命，促好生产的建设性意见。接着成立了一个由各个革命组织代表联合组成的“革命生产筹备委员会”，统一指挥全厂的革命和生产。
    革命造反派工人一旦掌握了自己的命运，就毫不迟疑地将革命和生产的重担挑起来了。他们用最大的努力，充分调动各方面的积极因素，发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲和连续作战的作风，大力克服人员不足等严重困难，扭转走资本主义道路当权派留下来的被动局面。广大革命造反派工人，怀着高度的革命责任感，以激昂的革命热情投入生产。热处理高频工走了，电工顶上去；插床师傅走了，刨床师傅接过去；磨工走了，车工替上去；师傅走了，徒工来操作。缺少工人，干部顶上去。有了毛泽东思想，天大的困难我们也能克服！油泵车间青年工人曾义同志，在有经验的老师傅离开生产岗位的情况下，挺身而出，连续三天顶班劳动十二小时，突破了齿轮磨内孔这个过去长期所没能完成的关键工序。造反派工人深深懂得，觉可以不睡，饭可以不吃，革命意志不可撼！齿轮车间工人周克亮、贺斌浩同志，一个人就控制四台机器，一天就完成了五十六小时的工作量。
    革命造反派不但在革命上是闯将，在生产中也是创新的能手。夺权后，一项项技术难关被革命造反派工人突破了。锻压车间徐家宝老师傅，主动承担厂里过去的一项一直没有解决的手摇泵弯管任务。齿轮车间设备能力低，完成任务存在很大问题。老工人韩正新和青年工人游林生以冲天的干劲和主人翁的责任感，打破迷信思想，敢想敢干，改进了机器，提高了工效两倍，突破了一项关键工序。
    革命的工人同志们时刻牢记毛主席的谆谆教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”许多工人老师傅迎着困难上，拣重活、挑重担。他们说：“困难再大，也大不过我们革命造反派工人忠于毛主席的一颗红心。”革命造反派工人在“革命生产筹委会”的领导下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在山城谱出又一曲动人心弦的凯歌！
    这个厂，截至一月三十一日上午十时为止，全面超额完成了一月份的生产任务，创造了建厂以来月度产值最高、成绩最好的新纪录。
    雄关漫道真如铁　而今迈步从头越
    过去月月完不成计划，产品批批过不了关，现在不但超额完成了计划，而且突破了许多技术关键。时间不过一个月，在这个不大的工厂里却起了如此翻天覆地的变化，这是什么原因呢？是革命，是伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众掌握了自己的命运。广大革命工人在无产阶级文化大革命的激励下，焕发出了过去所想象不到的革命智慧。归根结底，是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利。在座谈会上，“烈火”战斗队工人同志说：
    “我们工人阶级就是有志气，那些走资本主义道路的当权派不干，让他们滚吧！他们不干，我们自己干！我们干得一定更好！
    “毛主席他老人家对我们的内地建设如此关心，我们革命造反派的工人阶级有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要给毛主席他老人家争气！
    “我们工人阶级当了家作了主，革命一定要掀起来，生产一定要顶上去，我们要给全山城的、全中国的革命造反派争气！”
    风雷动，旌旗奋，定尘寰。革命造反派一旦掌了权，一旦踢开了走资本主义道路的当权派，就会创出人间奇迹，就能撼天动地！
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”重庆探矿机械厂的革命造反派工人，以最大的革命精神，举起了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击。坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。听吧！这就是山城探矿机械厂革命造反派的豪言壮语：
    头可断，血可流，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，誓把资产阶级脚下踩，誓把生产任务肩上挑，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！不获全胜，决不罢休！
