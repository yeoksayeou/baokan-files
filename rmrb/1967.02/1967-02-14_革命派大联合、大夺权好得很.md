Title: The Great Alliance and Seizure of Power by the Revolutionary Faction is Excellent

Edition: 6

The propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army blows the horn frequently, and the drums echo across the land. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reached a new turning point and entered a new stage. The revolutionary rebels surge forward like a mighty torrent, striking at the enemy's stronghold. The revolutionary rebels burn like a raging inferno, consuming the capitalist roaders' reactionary line. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line are facing imminent doom, howling in terror. With one hand, they wave the banner of "seizing the revolution," and with the other, they wield the butcher's knife to suppress the revolution. Using the party and state power they have usurped, they have thrown out the "economicism" trap, attempting to confuse the revolutionary people and shift the focus of the struggle. Pfft! The ant dares to shake the tree; the mantis dares to block the way! The revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless of "white terror" and cannot be toppled by "sugar-coated bullets"! We want the socialist mountains; who cares about your stinking money!

"The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours." How can we allow the restoration of capitalism? How can we allow the capitalist reactionary line to cause trouble! The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Above all, seizing power is the most important. We are heroes standing tall and firm. We have grand revolutionary goals. With Chairman Mao as our leader and supporter, we dare to climb the knife mountain and leap into the sea of fire! We will revolutionize to the end without betrayal, unshaken by great winds and waves, forever listening to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call: seize the revolution, promote production! Completely smash economicism, cut off the claws of the capitalist reactionary line! The revolutionary factions unite and combine, seize power for the proletariat, seize power for the cause of communism! Overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders in power, the few stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, and all the monsters and demons! Let the sky be the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, let the earth be the earth of Mao Zedong Thought, let the people be the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high!

    革命派大联合、大夺权好得很
    解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队战号频频吹，鼓声四海传。无产阶级文化大革命，在毛泽东思想指引下，到达了一个新的转折点，开始了一个新的阶段。革命造反派如滚滚洪流，冲击着敌人的老巢。革命造反派象熊熊烈火，把资产阶级反动路线焚烧。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分
  子，面临灭顶之灾，吓得鬼哭狼嚎。他们一手打着抓革命的幌子，一手拿着扼杀革命的屠刀，利用他们窃取的党政大权，又抛出了“经济主义”鬼圈套，企图迷惑革命人民，转移斗争目标。呸！蚍蜉撼树不自量，螳螂休想来挡道！毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派，“白色恐怖”无所惧，“糖衣炮弹”打不倒！我们要的是社会主义江山，谁稀罕你那几张臭钞票！
  “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。”怎能让资本主义复辟，怎能让资产阶级反动路线捣乱！革命的根本问题，是政权问题。千重要，万重要，掌握政权最重要。我们是顶天立地的好汉，我们有远大的革命目标。有毛主席给我们作主，有毛主席给我们撑腰！刀山敢上，火海敢跳！革命到底不变节，大风大浪不动摇，永远听毛主席的话，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召：抓革命，促生产！彻底粉碎经济主义，斩断资产阶级反动路线的魔爪！革命派大团结，大联合，为无产阶级夺权，为共产主义事业夺权！把一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固
  分子，把一切牛鬼蛇神打翻在地，再踏上一只脚！让天是毛泽东思想的天，让地是毛泽东思想的地，让人是毛泽东思想武装起来的人，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗漫天飘！（附图片）
