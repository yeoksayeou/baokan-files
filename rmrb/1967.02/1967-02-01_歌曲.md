	Songs

	Editor's Note:

	Currently, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are uniting under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, crushing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and with an irresistible revolutionary torrent and thunderous force, are seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

	This is an irresistible revolutionary tide, a great revolutionary storm sweeping the nation.

	Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful ideological weapon. In the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power, it is Mao Zedong Thought that has shown us the way, given us boundless courage, infinite wisdom, and endless strength!

	To support the proletarian revolutionaries in their struggle to seize power, we have selected a set of songs composed based on Chairman Mao's quotations for everyone to sing. Let us raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and launch an even more magnificent struggle to seize power from the capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents! Let us sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations loudly and bravely as we advance, welcoming the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Proletarian revolutionaries, unite! (with an attached picture)

    编者的话：
    目前，无产阶级革命派正在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，联合起来，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。
    这是不可抗拒的革命洪流，这是席卷全国的伟大革命风暴。
    毛泽东思想是我们最最强大的思想武器。在无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，是它给我们指明了方向，是它给了我们无限的勇气，无穷的智慧和无尽的力量！
    为了配合无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，我们选登一组为毛主席语录谱写的歌曲，供大家传唱。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起更加波澜壮阔的向党内走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，向资产阶级及其党内的代理人发起总攻击！让我们放声高唱毛主席语录歌奋勇前进，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的决定性的胜利！
    无产阶级革命派联合起来！（附图片）
