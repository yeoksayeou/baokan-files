Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Heilongjiang Province has been reborn! The proletarian cultural revolution army of Heilongjiang Province has achieved great unity, seizing back the party power, political power, economic power, and cultural power usurped by those in power who were taking the capitalist road!

We enthusiastically hail the great victory of the proletarian revolutionaries of Heilongjiang Province! We warmly congratulate the birth of the "Heilongjiang Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee"!

Heilongjiang Province is an important industrial and agricultural production base in our country, and a frontline in defending against the attacks of modern revisionism and the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan. The victory of the proletarian revolutionaries of Heilongjiang Province in their struggle for power has great significance for consolidating our country's proletarian dictatorship and developing our country's socialist construction.

The experience of the proletarian revolutionaries of Heilongjiang Province in their struggle for power once again demonstrates that the formation of a temporary power organ consisting of the responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations, the responsible persons of local units of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary leading cadres of party and government organs, plays a crucial role in the victory of the struggle for power.

It is completely wrong to adopt the policy of opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything. We must see that some leading cadres stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely fight against a handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road. We must fully trust such cadres and fight shoulder to shoulder with them. As for those leading cadres who are wavering or have made mistakes in their line, as long as they are willing to correct their mistakes and return to the party's correct line and Chairman Mao's line, we should also unite with them and fight together.

All leading cadres who are willing to continue the revolution should immediately rally and go among the masses, stand with the masses, and support the revolutionary rebels.

All revolutionary cadres should actively work under the leadership of the temporary power organ formed by the proletarian revolutionaries, pass the test of the new Cultural Revolution, humbly be the students of the masses, and create new merits for the Cultural Revolution.

We revolutionary rebels must implement the policy of "punishing past errors to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" for comrades who have made mistakes. In the new struggle practice, we should examine, unite, and help them.

The revolutionary masses, local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres of Heilongjiang have united to seize power. They first pledge to our great leader Chairman Mao that they will definitely strive to study well the "Three Articles" and the brilliant works such as "On Correcting Errors in the Party" to master the invincible ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. They have spoken well, acted correctly, and raised the issue at the right time, reflecting the strong wish of the revolutionary rebels.

The comrades of Heilongjiang say: "We deeply realize that if we only acknowledge the existence of class struggle in the socialist period but do not acknowledge the sharp and complex struggle for power in the socialist period, we cannot be a Red Guard of Mao Zedong Thought and a good soldier of Chairman Mao." They are indeed loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to the proletarian revolutionary rebels. Raising the struggle for power to the theoretical level of Mao Zedong Thought is a top priority that every revolutionary rebel must seriously consider.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party; leading cadres at all levels must fully pay attention to this and must not be careless." The proletarian revolutionaries of Heilongjiang have remembered this teaching of Chairman Mao in this struggle for power. They have put forward a series of good policies and specific measures according to the actual situation in their locality.

Experience has proven that we must have a correct proletarian revolutionary line, the courage, daring, and bravery of the struggle for power, and a series of specific policies and measures. Only in this way can we guarantee the victory of the proletarian revolutionaries in their struggle for power. The proletarian revolutionaries in all places must pay serious attention to this.

The victory of the proletarian revolutionaries of Heilongjiang Province in their struggle for power is the new dawn in the Northeast. Let us enthusiastically wish them continued progress on the great road of Mao Zedong Thought!

    东北的新曙光
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，黑龙江省新生了！黑龙江省的无产阶级文化革命大军，实现了大联合，把走资本主义道路当权派所窃踞的党权，政权，财权，文权，都夺回来了！
    我们热烈欢呼黑龙江省无产阶级革命派的伟大胜利！我们热烈祝贺“黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会”的诞生！
    黑龙江省是我国重要的工农业生产基地，是我国防御现代修正主义和美日反动派进攻的前哨。黑龙江省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，对于巩固我国的无产阶级专政，发展我国的社会主义建设，有着重大的意义。
    黑龙江省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的经验再一次表明，革命群众组织的负责人，人民解放军当地的负责人和党政机关的革命领导干部，组成三结合的临时权力机构，对夺权斗争的胜利，起了关键性的作用。
    采取反对一切、排斥一切、打倒一切的方针，是完全错误的。应当看到，有些领导干部，是站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决同一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争的。对于这样的干部，我们就一定要充分地信任他们，与他们并肩战斗。对于那些动摇不定的、或者犯过路线错误的领导干部，只要他们愿意改正，回到党的正确路线上来，回到毛主席的路线上来，我们也应该团结他们，一道战斗。
    凡是愿意继续革命的领导干部，都应该立即振作起来，到群众里面去，和群众站在一起，支持革命造反派。
    所有的革命干部，都应该在无产阶级革命派组成的临时权力机构的领导下，积极工作，经受文化大革命的新考验，虚心当群众的小学生，为文化大革命建立新功劳。
    我们革命造反派对于犯错误的同志，一定要执行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，在新的斗争实践中考察他们，团结他们，帮助他们。
    黑龙江的革命群众、人民解放军当地驻军和革命干部联合起来，夺取政权后，首先向我们伟大的领袖毛主席保证，一定要努力学好“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，掌握好毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的思想武器。他们说得好，做得对，提得及时，反映了革命造反派强烈的愿望。
    黑龙江的同志们说：“我们深刻地认识到，只承认社会主义时期存在着阶级斗争，不承认社会主义时期尖锐复杂的夺权斗争，就不能当一个毛泽东思想红卫兵和毛主席的好战士。”他们不愧是忠于毛主席、忠于无产阶级的革命造反派。把夺权斗争提高到毛泽东思想的理论水平上来，这是每个革命造反派都必须认真思考的头等大事。
    毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”黑龙江的无产阶级革命派，在这次夺权斗争中，记住了毛主席的这个教导。他们根据当地的实际情况，及时地提出了一系列的很好的政策和具体措施。
    经验证明，我们有了正确的无产阶级的革命路线，有了夺权斗争的胆略、魄力和勇气，还必须有一系列的具体政策和措施。只有这样，才能保证无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利。各地无产阶级革命派，必须切实注意这一点。
    黑龙江省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，是东北的新曙光。让我们热烈地祝贺他们在毛泽东思想的大道上继续前进！
