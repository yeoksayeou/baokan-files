In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has entered the stage of the great alliance of revolutionary masses and the seizure of power from the capitalist roaders, some revolutionary cadres within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee have bravely stood up and joined forces with us revolutionary rebels to seize power from a handful of scoundrels who have usurped the Party, government, and financial powers in Shanxi. They have set a good example for revolutionary cadres nationwide.

These revolutionary cadres, at this critical moment of struggle between the two lines, the two classes, and the two roads, have been able to break free from the shackles imposed on them by counter-revolutionary revisionists for many years and come out fighting. Is this accidental? No, absolutely not.

For a long time, the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and some counter-revolutionary revisionists in the central leadership have colluded, forming a clique, and have been promoting and elevating their cronies, ruthlessly suppressing and striking down those who hold different opinions from them. They have established a bourgeois dictatorship. In recent years, they have installed many anti-Party elements and right-opportunists in Shanxi, giving them special treatment, so that one day they can rise again and restore capitalism in China. On the other hand, they have exiled to Shanxi some comrades who dared to fight against them in the central leadership, labeling them with various crimes and severely restricting them, in order to suppress them forever.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has personally initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The former First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee, Comrade Yuan Zhen, gave the Provincial Party Committee some correct opinions, which terrified the bourgeois lords within the Provincial Party Committee. They immediately mobilized a large number of forces to label Comrade Yuan Zhen as a "power-seeker," "ambitious person," and "anti-Party element," and used this as an opportunity to promote these local-made hats, creating a white terror, attempting to suppress the surging Great Cultural Revolution. The "Yuan Zhen issue" exposed the tracks of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Provincial Party Committee, and at the same time, it gave us an enlightenment: the leading cadres of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees are not a monolith. While mobilizing the general cadres, we should also strengthen our work among the leading cadres of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees.

In this way, we began to contact some leading cadres. Initially, we only tried to obtain some materials exposing the problems of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees from them. However, some accusations came flying at us: "You are taking the high road!" "You are using the tactic of 'besieging the city'!" We brought this problem to the study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." If we only rely on the exposure of informed persons and cannot clearly distinguish ourselves from the capitalist-roaders within the Party, that is completely wrong. But if we do not make a class analysis of the leading cadres and kick them all aside, cannot treat them dialectically, and distinguish between them, that is also wrong. The capitalist-roaders within the Party must be overthrown and criticized; the socialist-roaders within the Party must be helped and supported, and there can be no third attitude. Unite all forces that can be united, isolate and strike at a handful of the most stubborn enemies. This is Chairman Mao's consistent strategic thinking. Mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres to launch a fierce attack on the capitalist-roaders within the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, and at the same time, be good at using contradictions to split and disintegrate them, combining internal and external forces to attack them, making the enemy fall into a situation of being surrounded on all sides. Wouldn't that be better?

It should be seen that our cadres have long been educated by Chairman Mao, and most of them are relatively good. The struggle between the two lines and the two roads also exists among the leading cadres. Add to this the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has swept away some rotten units and drowned many big villains, and also educated many revolutionary leading cadres. Therefore, it is completely possible for some revolutionary leading cadres to stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels. Even for those comrades who made mistakes of direction and line in the previous period, as long as they can correct their mistakes and stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we are also warmly welcome. Those who hear "those in power" and oppose them all, not daring to get involved, are typical of being "left" in form but right in essence.

With the development of the situation, after doing a lot of work, five leading comrades, including Deputy Governor Liu Geping of Shanxi Province, wrote a big-character poster on January 10, exposing the problems of the Provincial Party Committee. This action immediately received the enthusiastic welcome of the revolutionary rebels, and our contact with them became closer. On January 12, Comrades Liu Geping and Zhang Riqing, the second political commissar of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, together with us, more than twenty revolutionary rebel organizations, formulated a battle plan and established the "Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters." After a tense struggle, we finally successfully seized the power of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Committee, Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee, and Municipal People's Committee. From then on, the leadership power of Shanxi Province, which was usurped by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, truly returned to the hands of the people, and the officials who oppressed the people were overthrown. The revolutionary rebels who were previously suppressed took the helm! All this, for us revolutionary rebels, is such a satisfying thing!

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggle." Although the leaders at the provincial level have been overthrown, the henchmen below have jumped out. They spread rumors, shoot arrows in the dark, and say that the General Headquarters has a "backer," is "manipulated by others," and shout "beware of pickpockets." They even announced that the "First Announcement of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" is a "counter-revolutionary manifesto" and shouted that they want to "repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line," directing the spearhead of the struggle at the General Headquarters and even viciously attacking the Central Cultural Revolution Group. They are fierce and formidable.

The class struggle has presented a new situation, and a severe test is placed before every revolutionary organization and every revolutionary! There are some people who have lost their way, doubted, and wavered in the storm of class struggle; some people are secretly plotting to dissolve the General Headquarters and pull together another group of people to establish a "Second Headquarters"; some people have withdrawn from the General Headquarters and even turned black into white to attack the General Headquarters. These people, who shout "unity" and "seize power" all day, but when it comes to the critical moment of "seizing power," they are afraid and retreat. They are typical "Yi Gong loves dragons"! They are not proletarian revolutionaries but "comrades-in-arms of the revolution." There is too little Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, and too much individualism and factionalism. If they do not learn from this and continue to develop, it will be very dangerous.

Saying that we have a "backer" is simply pointing to a few "those in power" supporting us to seize power; saying that we are "manipulated by others" is simply pointing to those few "those in power" giving us advice and helping us to seize power; and the so-called "political pickpockets" are even more pointing at Comrades Liu Geping, Zhang Riqing, and a few other "those in power." It can be seen that the essence of the disagreement is how to view the issue of "those in power."

The standard for determining whether a person is revolutionary or not is whether they support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, and support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. If they try to use "the masses" and "those in power" or some organization's name as a standard, they are all fallacies! Are you a bourgeoisie in power? We bombard you! We bombard you until you can't defend yourself, roll around in urine, and fall from power, completely ruined! Are you a firm proletarian in power? We support you! We unite and fight together, seize power together, and take power together! Our position is firm, and our attitude is clear. We believe that many revolutionary leading cadres, in the arduous years of war, have withstood the test of revolutionary fire, and after victory, have resisted the "sugar-coated bullets." From the central to the local, they have long fought against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. And in this power struggle, they have firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly stood with the revolutionary rebels, with a clear attitude and firm position. These comrades are the wealth of our Party and state. Why can't we approach them, unite with them, and share power with them? We can, we can, we can completely. The fact is that in the more than ten days since the establishment of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, several leading cadres, including Comrade Liu Geping, have helped the revolutionary masses quickly solve many difficulties in their work due to their insistence on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and their rich experience in political, economic, and military struggles. The experience of many units taken over by the General Headquarters also shows that where the internal and external revolutionary rebels are closely united, the work of the masses is done well for the leading cadres who are willing to rebel, the takeover is smooth and thorough, and production can go up.

We must also see that in this great Cultural Revolution that is turning everything upside down, in the life-and-death struggle between the two classes and the two lines, those capitalist-roaders within the Party will also raise the banner of "revolution" and "rebellion," infiltrate our ranks, stir up trouble, distort right and wrong, and incite the masses to direct the spearhead of the struggle at the proletarian headquarters, at the proletarian revolutionary masses, in an attempt to disrupt our ranks. They will also use the arrogance and personal gain-seeking thoughts that have grown in some revolutionary comrades after victory, using both soft and hard methods, to persuade and surrender, using the tactics of infiltrating and pulling out, to usurp the revolutionary leadership and steal the fruits of the revolution. We must not relax our vigilance against the enemy's conspiracy.

The revolutionary leading cadres have stood at the forefront of the struggle, greatly accelerating the process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The emergence of this new thing will undoubtedly have a major and positive impact on the proletarian power struggle.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the new stage of comprehensive seizure of power, which is an irresistible historical torrent that will preserve those who follow it and destroy those who resist it. All cadres will be tested and decided to be discarded or retained: will they put down their burdens and rebel, resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao? Or will they hesitate and waver at the crossroads, observe and wait? Or will they be stubborn and resist to the end, perishing with the bourgeois reactionary line? All cadres who want to rebel, make your choice quickly!

    坚决支持革命的领导干部起来造反
    山西革命造反总指挥部《革命造反》报编辑部
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进入无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的新阶段中，山西省委、太原市委内一些革命的领导干部，挺身而出，勇敢地和我们革命造反派站在一起，向一小撮窃踞山西的党、政、财大权的混蛋们夺了权，为全国的革命领导干部树立了好榜样。
    这些革命的领导干部，在两条路线、两个阶级、两条道路大搏斗的关键时刻，能够突破多年来反革命修正主义分子加在他们身上的重镣，杀将出来，是偶然的吗？不，不，绝对不是。
    长期以来，山西省委内的资产阶级代表人物和盘踞在中央的某些反革命修正主义分子，上下串通，结成一党，大搞宗派主义，极力扶植和提拔亲信，残酷地排挤、打击和他们持有不同意见的革命派，建立了资产阶级专制统治。近年来，他们自以为山西这个独立王国经营得蛮不错了，于是，一方面，把许多反党分子、右倾机会主义分子安插在山西，倍加照顾，以便有朝一日东山再起，在中国复辟资本主义。另一方面，他们又把一些在中央敢于同他们作斗争的同志加上各种罪名，“充军”到山西，备受限制，以便禁锢住他们，使他们永世不得翻身。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命来到了，太原市前市委第一书记袁振同志，给省委提了一些正确的意见，便吓坏了省委中的资产阶级老爷们。他们立即动员了大批人马，把袁振同志打成“伸手派”、“野心家”、“反党分子”，并趁势大力推销这些土产帽子，制造白色恐怖，妄图把轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动镇压下去。“袁振问题”露出了省委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的马脚，同时，也给了我们一个启发：省、市委的领导干部不是铁板一块，在大力发动一般干部的同时，应该加强对于省、市委领导干部的工作。
    就这样，我们开始同一些领导干部接触。起初，我们只是试图从他们那里搞到一些揭发省、市委问题的材料。但是，一些指责飞来了：“你们走上层路线！”“你们搞‘兵临城下’！”我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”如果我们只把希望寄托在知情人的揭发上，甚至和党内走资本主义道路的当权派划不清界限，那是完全错误的。但是，如果对领导干部不做阶级分析，统统踢在一边，不能对他们一分为二，区别对待，那也是错误的。党内走资本主义道路的当权派一定要斗倒、斗臭；党内走社会主义道路的当权派一定要帮助，要支持，决不能有第三种态度。团结一切可以团结的力量，孤立和打击一小撮最顽固的敌人，这是毛主席一贯的战略思想。发动广大的工人、农民、革命干部向省、市委内走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈进攻，同时又善于利用矛盾分化瓦解他们，来个上下结合，内外夹攻，使敌人陷于四面楚歌的境地，那岂不更好吗？
    应该看到，我们的干部长期接受毛主席的教育，大部分是比较好的。两条路线、两条道路的斗争在领导干部中同样是存在的。加上汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮，冲垮了一些烂掉的单位，淹死了许多大坏蛋，也教育了不少革命的领导干部。因此，有些革命的领导干部站到革命造反派方面来，是完全可能的。即使对于那些在前一个时期犯过方向性、路线性错误的同志，只要能够痛改前非，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，我们也是热烈欢迎的。那些一听到“当权派”就统统反对，不敢沾边的作法，是典型的形“左”实右。
    随着形势的发展，经过进行大量的工作后，山西省副省长刘格平等五位领导同志在一月十日写出了一张革命的大字报，揭发了省委的问题。这一行动立即得到了革命造反派的热烈欢迎，我们与他们的联系更紧密了。一月十二日刘格平等同志和山西省军区第二政委张日清同志与我们二十多个革命造反派组织一起，制定了作战计划，成立了“山西革命造反总指挥部”。经过了紧张的斗争，终于一举胜利地夺取了山西省委、省人委、太原市委、市人委的大权。从此，被一小撮反革命修正主义分子霸占的山西省的领导权，真正回到了人民手里，欺压人民的官老爷们被打翻在地。从前受打击的革命造反派掌握了印把子！这一切，对我们革命造反派来说，该是件多么痛快的事啊！
    可是，正如毛主席所指出的那样：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”省里的头头虽然倒台了，下面的喽罗们却跳出来了。他们造谣言，放暗箭，胡说什么总指挥部“有后台”，“受人操纵”，大叫“谨防扒手”，甚至宣布“山西革命造反总指挥部第一号通告”是“反革命宣言书”，叫嚷什么要“打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”，把斗争矛头指向总指挥部，甚至恶毒地攻击中央文革。气势汹汹，煞是厉害。
    阶级斗争出现了新的形势，严峻的考验摆在每一个革命组织、每一个革命者面前！有那么一些人，他们在阶级斗争的风浪中迷失了方向，疑惑了，动摇了；有的人就暗中策划，想解散总指挥部，另拉起一批人马成立“第二司令部”；有人还退出了总指挥部，甚至颠倒黑白，也攻击起总指挥部来了。这些人，成天高喊“联合”“夺权”，可是真正到了“夺权”的关键时刻却害怕了，退缩了，真是典型的“叶公好龙”！他们不是无产阶级革命家，而是“革命的同路人”。他们头脑中毛泽东思想太少，个人主义、山头主义太多。如果再不以此为训，发展下去是很危险的。
    说我们“有后台”，无非是指有那么几位“当权派”支持我们夺权；说我们“受人操纵”，也无非是指那几个“当权派”给我们出谋划策，帮助我们夺权；而所谓“政治扒手”，则更是把矛头指向刘格平、张日清等几位“当权派”了。可见，分歧的实质是怎样看待“当权派”问题。　
    划分一个人革命不革命的标准，看你拥护不拥护毛主席，拥护不拥护毛泽东思想，拥护不拥护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，如果企图用“群众”和“当权派”，或是用这样那样组织的名称来做标准，统统都是谬论！你是资产阶级当权派吗？我们炮轰你！直轰得你招架不住，屁滚尿流，滚下台来，彻底完蛋！你是坚定的无产阶级当权派吗？我们支持你！联合起来，一起斗争，一起夺权，一起掌权！我们的立场是坚定的，我们的态度是鲜明的。我们认为，有许多革命的领导干部，在艰苦的战争年代，经受住了革命战火的考验，胜利以后又抵抗住了“糖衣炮弹”，从中央到地方，他们与党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了长期的斗争。而在这次夺权斗争中，他们坚决站到以毛主席为代表的革命路线一边，坚决与革命造反派站在一起，态度鲜明，立场坚定。这些同志是我们党和国家的财富。对于他们，为什么不可以接近，不可以联合，不可以共同掌权呢？可以，可以，完全可以。事实正是这样，山西革命造反总指挥部成立十多天来，刘格平等几位领导干部，由于他们坚持了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，由于他们有着长期进行政治斗争、经济斗争、军事斗争的丰富经验，他们帮助革命群众迅速地解决了不少工作中的困难问题。总指挥部所接管的很多单位经验也表明，凡是接管单位内外革命造反派结合得紧密，群众对愿意造反的领导干部的工作做得好，那里的接管就顺利，就彻底，生产也就上得去。
    我们也必须看到，在这场翻天覆地的文化大革命中，在两个阶级两条路线殊死的大搏斗中，那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，也会打起“革命”、“造反”的旗号，混入我们的阵营，搬弄是非，颠倒黑白，煽动群众把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，指向无产阶级革命派，妄图扰乱我们的阵线。他们还会利用一些革命同志在取得胜利后的骄傲情绪和滋长起来的个人名利思想，软硬兼施，招降纳叛，采取打进来，拉出去的手法，篡夺革命的领导权，窃取革命的胜利果实。对于敌人的这一阴谋，我们务必不能松懈自己的警惕性。
    革命的领导干部站到了斗争的前列，大大加速了无产阶级文化大革命的进程，这个新生事物的出现，必将对无产阶级的夺权斗争发生重大的、积极的影响。
    无产阶级文化大革命已进入了全面大夺权的新阶段，这是一股顺之者存，逆之者灭的不可抗拒的历史洪流。一切干部都要经受检验，决定弃取：是放下包袱，起来造反，坚决站到以毛主席为代表的革命路线一边呢？还是站在十字路口犹豫动摇，徘徊观望呢？还是执迷不悟，顽抗到底，与资产阶级反动路线同归于尽呢？一切愿意革命的干部们快作出抉择吧！
