The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, a handful of jumping jacks, are trembling in front of the news window! Just a few photographs, why are they so terrified? Devils fear the sun, traitors fear the truth, and dare not lift their heads! They are afraid that the Soviet people will see through their traitorous faces; they attempt to destroy the evidence and launch a full-scale attack! They send out spies, wielding axes, committing fascist atrocities, and do not care about exposing their ugliness! They act arbitrarily and unreasonably, scrapping international relationship norms, and what kind of country is this? There is not a single bit, not even half a bit! They are enemies of the Chinese people and foes of the Soviet people. Reactionaries will meet a bad end, and the Soviet revisionists will not last long! As you sow, so shall you reap. The Soviet revisionists lift the stone of anti-China, and it will surely smash their own heads to pieces!

    自作还须自受
    贺卓苏修统治集团，一小撮跳梁小丑，面对新闻橱窗，吓得浑身发抖！不过几张照片，为何惊恐不休？魔鬼怕见太阳，叛徒怕真理，不敢抬
  头！害怕苏联人民，把他们的叛徒嘴脸识
  透；妄图消灭罪证，来一个大打出手！派出特务，挥舞斧头，干出法西斯暴行，顾不得出乖露丑！横行霸道不讲理，国际关系准则一笔
  勾，哪还有个国家的样
  子？一点没有，半点也没
  有！与中国人民为敌，与苏联人民为仇，反动派没有好下场，苏修日子不长久！种瓜得瓜，种豆得
  豆，自作还须自受，苏修搬起反华的石
  头，定将把自己砸得头破
  血流！
