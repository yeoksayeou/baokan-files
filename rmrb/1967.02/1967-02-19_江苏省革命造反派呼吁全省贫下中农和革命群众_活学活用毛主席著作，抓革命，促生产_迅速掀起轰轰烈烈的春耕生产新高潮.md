Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Rebels call on all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in the province to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seize the revolution and promote production, and swiftly launch a new spring ploughing and production high tide.

Revolutionary leaders at all levels in rural areas should step forward, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and boldly lead the current production work. The proletarian revolutionary factions must be highly vigilant and promptly expose all the tricks and schemes of the class enemies to sabotage spring ploughing and production.

New China News Agency, Nanjing, February 18 - The Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Rebels issued an emergency notice on February 14 titled "Seize the Revolution and Promote Production, Welcome the New Spring Ploughing and Production High Tide," calling on all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in the province to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They should swiftly launch a new spring ploughing and production high tide to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest this year and achieve victories in both revolution and production.

The emergency notice analyzes the current good situation of the proletarian Cultural Revolution in rural areas and exposes how a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, at a time when spring ploughing and sowing are becoming increasingly urgent, are further fanning the counter-revolutionary economic wind, engaging in material incentives, or being lazy and refusing to work, or inciting some uninformed masses to leave their production posts, or stirring up factional strife and establishing reactionary organizations, etc. They aim to sabotage spring ploughing and sowing, disrupt agricultural production, and achieve their goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. The emergency notice calls on all proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants to be highly vigilant and promptly expose all the tricks and schemes of the class enemies and give them a resolute rebuff.

The emergency notice puts forward ten demands to the rural revolutionary rebels, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres:

1. Rural revolutionary rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely follow the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the rural proletarian Cultural Revolution (draft), rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite with the middle peasants, achieve a great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and seize back all the power they have usurped into the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions and consolidate it. Consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the rural proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

2. Rural revolutionary rebels must be models of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, strengthen organizational leadership, form two sets of teams for revolution and production, and under unified leadership, vigorously seize the revolution and promote production. In terms of promoting production, the current priority is to mobilize the masses, with revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, to strengthen or re-elect the leadership teams of production brigades. Special districts, counties, communes, and production brigades should also establish production committees under the leadership of revolutionary rebels or under the supervision of revolutionary rebels, to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production.

3. Revolutionary leaders at all levels in rural areas should step forward, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and boldly lead the current production work. Cadres who have made mistakes should, in addition to seriously examining and confessing, work hard under the supervision of the revolutionary rebels, make amends for their mistakes, and not be lazy or incite the masses to leave their production posts, transfer contradictions upwards, and shift the direction of the struggle. Only in this way can they gain the understanding of the Party and the masses. If they continue to insist on their mistakes, they will compound their crimes. No matter who it is, if they sabotage agricultural production, they will be dealt with as sabotaging the Cultural Revolution.

4. In areas where the Four Clean-ups movement has been carried out, the achievements of the Four Clean-ups movement must be resolutely defended. The revolutionary enthusiasm aroused during the Four Clean-ups movement should be used to improve current agricultural production. If those who were overthrown during the Four Clean-ups movement by those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists try to launch a counterattack and revenge during the Cultural Revolution and sabotage production, they must be suppressed.

5. The current urgent task for production leadership teams at all levels is to fully mobilize the masses, carry out mass discussions, immediately formulate a plan to strive for an even greater bumper harvest this year, set active and reliable goals, and under the premise of completing the state plan, adapt measures to local conditions, ensure water sources, ensure crop layout, ensure increase production measures, ensure production materials, ensure agricultural machinery maintenance, arrange labor force, and continuously conduct inspections, solve problems in a timely manner. All sectors must provide strong support.

6. Time must be seized to immediately prepare for all aspects of spring ploughing and sowing. Two preparations must be made: in areas with severe drought, anti-drought preparations must be intensified to ensure the timely completion of winter and spring water conservancy projects, especially agricultural water conservancy projects. Wheat fields must be dredged and drained, and green manure must be applied to strengthen the field management of overwintering crops to ensure a bumper summer harvest this year. At the same time, fertilizer accumulation, seed selection, spring floods, spring livestock breeding, spring hatching, spring afforestation, and fruit tree pruning must be done well.

7. All policies of rural people's communes must be implemented according to the "Sixty Articles." Production committees at all levels must, on the premise of vigorously developing production, properly arrange the living conditions of commune members, do a good job in income distribution, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The year-end distribution for 1966 should be completed before the spring ploughing and production. In the distribution, politics must be highlighted, and the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual must be correctly handled. All kinds of counter-revolutionary economicism must be resolutely opposed. Chairman Mao's call to "be thrifty and make revolution" must be resolutely responded to. Do not pursue grandeur and extravagance, waste state property, or be hit by the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie.

8. Revolutionary students and cadres who are conducting revolutionary linkages in rural areas must vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, participate in labor, support spring ploughing and sowing, and combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, familiarize themselves with society, familiarize themselves with the masses, and familiarize themselves with class struggle. Cadres, commune members, and educated youth who have gone out for linkages or to the mountains and countryside should immediately return to their original places and units, go back to their hometowns, and make revolution on the spot.

9. In the process of seizing the revolution and promoting production, all proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, break down private interests and establish public interests, and carry out a thorough ideological revolution. The proletarian revolutionary factions must use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies such as localism, sectarianism, ultra-democracy, non-organizational views, subjectivism, and individualism, and enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. Form an extremely proletarianized and extremely combat-ready revolutionary army, and turn the vast rural areas into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

10. The above points are hoped to be promptly implemented by the rural revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses, and widely propagated to make them known to every household. (With pictures)

    江苏省革命造反派呼吁全省贫下中农和革命群众
    活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产
    迅速掀起轰轰烈烈的春耕生产新高潮
    农村各级革命领导干部应挺身而出，积极参加文化大革命，大胆领导当前的生产工作无产阶级革命派必须百倍提高警惕，及时识破阶级敌人破坏春耕生产的一切阴谋诡计
    新华社南京十八日电　江苏省革命造反派于二月十四日联合发出《抓革命促生产，迎接春耕生产新高潮》紧急通告，呼吁全省广大贫下中农和革命群众，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，迅速掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产新高潮，为全年农业丰收打下坚实基础，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    紧急通告分析了当前农村无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，并且揭露了一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在当前春耕春种越来越紧的时候，正在进一步大煽反革命经济主义黑风，大搞物质刺激，或者消极怠工，躺倒不干，或者煽动一些不明真相的群众离开生产岗位，或者挑动宗派斗争，建立反动组织等等，企图破坏春耕春种，破坏农业生产，以达到他们破坏文化大革命的目的。紧急通告号召一切无产阶级革命派和革命的贫下中农，必须百倍地提高警惕，及时识破阶级敌人所耍弄的一切阴谋诡计，并给予坚决回击。
    紧急通告向农村革命造反派、贫下中农和革命干部提出了十项要求：
    一、农村的革命造反派，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案），依靠贫下中农，团结中农，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把被他们所篡夺的领导权，统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手中并巩固起来，巩固无产阶级专政，把农村无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    二、农村的革命造反派，要成为“抓革命，促生产”的模范，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副担子，加强组织领导，组成革命、生产两套班子，在统一领导下，狠抓革命，大促生产。在抓生产方面，当前首先要发动群众，以革命的贫下中农为骨干，健全或改选生产队的领导生产的班子。专区、县、公社、大队，也都要由革命造反派或在革命造反派的监督之下，把生产委员会建立起来，加强对农业生产的领导。
    三、农村各级革命的领导干部应当挺身而出，积极参加文化大革命，并大胆领导当前的生产工作。犯有错误的领导干部，除认真检查交代外，应在革命造反派的监督之下，认真做好工作，立功赎罪，不许躺倒不干，不许煽动群众离开生产岗位，把矛盾上交，转移斗争大方向。只有这样，才能取得党和群众的谅解。如果继续坚持错误，就得罪上加罪。不管是谁，只要破坏农业生产，一律以破坏文化大革命论处。
    四、在已经进行四清运动的地区，要坚决保卫四清运动的成果。把在四清运动中焕发起来的革命干劲，用到搞好当前农业生产中去。如有在四清运动中被整的走资本主义道路的当权派和地富反坏右分子，趁文化大革命进行反攻倒算，破坏生产，坚决予以镇压。
    五、各级抓生产的班子，当务之急是要充分发动群众，开展群众性的大讨论，立即订出一个争取全年农业生产更大丰收的计划，提出积极可靠的奋斗目标，在完成国家计划的前提下，因地制宜，落实水源，落实作物布局，落实增产措施，落实生产资料，落实农机维修，作好劳力安排，并不断进行检查，发现问题及时解决。各行各业必须大力支持。
    六、要抓紧时机，立即做好春耕春种的各项准备。一定要做好两手打算，在旱情严重的地区，要加紧防旱抗旱的准备，力争按质按量提前完成冬春水利工程，特别要做好农田水利工程，要做好麦田开沟排水，追施返青肥，加强越冬作物的田间管理，力争今年的夏熟丰收。同时必须认真做好积肥，串换良种以及春汛、耕畜春配、春孵、春季造林和果树修剪等工作。
    七、农村人民公社各项政策，都应当按照“六十条”办事。各级生产委员会必须在大力发展生产的前提下，妥善安排社员生活，抓好收益分配工作，进一步调动群众生产积极性。一九六六年度的年终分配，应当在春耕生产前全部结束。在分配中必须突出政治，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系，坚决反对各种各样的反革命经济主义。坚决响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的号召，不要讲排场，讲阔气，浪费国家财物，不要被资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”所打中。
    八、在农村进行革命串连的革命学生和革命干部，要大力宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线，同时必须参加劳动，支援春耕春种，和贫下中农相结合，熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争。农村中外出串连的干部、社员和上山下乡的知识青年，应立即回到本地本单位，打回老家去，就地闹革命。
    九、一切无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在抓革命促生产中，必须活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，破私立公，大搞思想革命化。无产阶级革命派要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，坚决克服本位主义、小团体主义、极端民主化、非组织观点、主观主义、个人主义等等资产阶级和小资产阶级的思潮，提高无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。组织一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大军，把广大农村办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    十、上述各条，希农村的革命造反派和广大革命群众立即贯彻执行，并广为宣传，做到家喻户晓。（附图片）
