The Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet authorities over their outrageous anti-Chinese provocation.

	NEW DELHI, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- On the evening of February 9, the news specialist of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Miao Qun, summoned the first secretary of the Far East Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nie Heshou, to protest the Soviet authorities' provocation of directing police and plainclothes agents to surround Chinese diplomatic personnel.

	The protest stated: On the afternoon of February 9, when Chinese students studying in the German Democratic Republic were passing through Moscow on their way back to China, the news specialist of the Chinese Embassy, Miao Qun, the second secretary, Bai Huiquan, and staff member Zhu Yinzhi, along with five others, went to the station to see them off. At the platform of the station, a group of Soviet hooligans threw ice and snowballs at the Chinese students and train crew, and shouted hysterically at the Chinese diplomatic personnel and staff. They even viciously insulted the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. The Soviet revisionist leadership directed hundreds of police and plainclothes agents to surround the Chinese diplomatic personnel outside the Yaroslavsky Station's "Komsomolskaya Square" for over forty minutes. The hooligans, under the command of a colonel and two lieutenant colonels and several other junior officers, smashed cars, threw ice, apples, eggs, spat, and insulted the Chinese diplomatic personnel in an extremely crazy and arrogant manner. At that time, more than two thousand Soviet citizens witnessed this anti-Chinese farce, and many people were very angry and dissatisfied with the hooligans' shameful behavior, and expressed friendly wishes to our personnel. Our personnel immediately protested to the Soviet lieutenant colonel on the spot.

	Miao Qun pointed out in the protest: This incident is a planned and organized provocation by the Soviet revisionist leadership, further evidence of the Soviet revisionist leadership's violation of international diplomatic customs, vicious anti-China stance, and further hostility towards the Chinese people. For this, the Chinese Embassy has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Soviet government must guarantee the safety of the diplomatic personnel and all staff of the Chinese Embassy; otherwise, the Soviet government will be responsible for all consequences arising from this.

	After hearing the protest, Nie Heshou blatantly denied the provocation and even turned the tables, claiming that the Chinese Embassy had orchestrated the incident. Under the stern questioning of our news specialist, Miao Qun, Nie Heshou, faced with the facts, had to admit that the incident had occurred, but he tried to evade responsibility by claiming that there had been a translation error. In the end, Nie Heshou was refuted by the ironclad facts presented by our news specialist, leaving him speechless and in a sorry state.

    苏修当局指使大批警察和特务包围我外交人员
    我使馆严重抗议苏修疯狂反华的新挑衅
    新华社莫斯科九日电　中国驻苏联大使馆新闻专员缪群九日晚上约见苏联外交部远东司一等秘书聂鹤寿，就苏联当局指使警察和便衣特务包围我国外交人员的挑衅事件，向苏联外交部提出严重抗议。
    抗议说：二月九日下午，我国在德意志民主共和国的留学生路过莫斯科回国时，我大使馆新闻专员缪群、二等秘书白惠全和工作人员朱荫枝等八人前往车站送行。在车站月台上，苏联一群暴徒向我国留学生和我国列车员投掷冰块、雪球，并对我外交人员和工作人员发出歇斯底里的狂叫。他们竟然恶毒侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。苏修领导集团并指使二、三百名警察和便衣特务，把我国外交人员包围在雅罗斯拉夫车站外边的“共青团广场”上达四十多分钟。暴徒们在一名上校、两名中校和几名少校警官的指挥下，砸汽车，扔冰块、苹果、鸡蛋，吐唾沫，辱骂我外交人员，极端疯狂、嚣张。当时有两千多苏联群众目睹了这场反华丑剧，很多人对这群暴徒的下流行为，极为愤怒和不满，并对我人员表示友好祝愿。我人员当场向苏联中校警官提出了严重抗议。
    缪群在抗议中指出：这次事件是苏修领导集团有计划、有组织的挑衅行动，是苏修领导集团破坏国际外交惯例，恶毒反华，进一步敌视中国人民的又一铁证。对此，中国大使馆向苏联外交部提出严重抗议。苏联政府必须对中国大使馆外交人员和全体工作人员的安全作出保证，否则，由此而引起的一切后果，要由苏联政府负责。
    聂鹤寿听完抗议后，竟矢口抵赖这一挑衅事件，并竟然反咬一口，胡说什么中国大使馆策划了这一事件。在我新闻专员缪群严词质问下，聂鹤寿在事实面前，只好承认发生了这一事件，但他借口由于翻译上的错误，企图抵赖他自己所说的这一事件是中国大使馆所策划的胡言乱语。最后，聂鹤寿被我新闻专员用铁的事实驳得哑口无言，狼狈不堪。
