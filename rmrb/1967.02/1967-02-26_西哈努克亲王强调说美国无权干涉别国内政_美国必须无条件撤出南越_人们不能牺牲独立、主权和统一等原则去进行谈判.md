Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia once again expressed his sympathy for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. He said, "The United States must withdraw from Vietnam and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems."

Prince Sihanouk, who is currently staying in France, made these remarks at a luncheon held jointly by the French Foreign Press Association and the Anglo-American Press Association. He said that the United States wants the Vietnamese people to make concessions on the principles of independence, sovereignty, and unity, which is unacceptable to the Vietnamese people. People cannot sacrifice these principles for negotiations. He said, "For Cambodia, we would rather die, fight to the last person, than accept negotiations that sacrifice these principles."

He emphasized that the United States has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries—even small ones. He demanded that the United States unconditionally withdraw from South Vietnam.

Prince Sihanouk said that China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are good friends of Cambodia. They do not interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs and respect Cambodia's sovereignty. He refuted the American argument that if the United States withdraws from Southeast Asia, countries like Cambodia will face "threats," and it is only under American "aid" to fight communism that South Vietnam (the Saigon puppet regime) and Thailand can maintain "freedom." He said, "Look at what South Vietnam has become under the rule of American puppets like Ngo Dinh Diem and Nguyen Khanh: Is it independent? No! Is it free? No! Is it democratic? No! Is it self-governing? No! Is it corrupt? Yes!"

Prince Sihanouk also condemned the United States and its puppets in Thailand and South Vietnam for invading Cambodian territory, bombing, and killing Cambodian civilians.

He said, "Who is destroying our peace, neutrality, sovereignty, and territorial integrity? It is not the communists, but the Americans, the pro-American Thais, the pro-American South Vietnamese, and their bought 'Free Khmer Movement.'"

Prince Sihanouk said that Cambodia is determined to defend its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. As long as the United States does not recognize and respect Cambodia's sovereignty and borders, and as long as it continues to invade Cambodian territory, Cambodia will not restore diplomatic relations with it.

    西哈努克亲王强调说美国无权干涉别国内政 
    美国必须无条件撤出南越
    人们不能牺牲独立、主权和统一等原则去进行谈判
    新华社巴黎二十五日电　柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王二十四日再次表明他同情越南人民的抗美救国斗争。他说：“美国必须撤出越南，让越南人民自己解决自己的事务。”
    正在法国逗留的西哈努克亲王在法国外交记者协会和英美报业协会联合为他举行的午餐会上说，美国要越南人在独立、主权、统一等原则上作出让步，这是越南人民不能接受的。人们不能牺牲独立、主权、统一等原则去进行谈判。他说，对柬埔寨来说，我们宁愿死，宁愿战至最后一个人，也不愿接受牺牲这些原则的谈判。
    他强调说，美国无权干涉别国——即使是一个小国——的内政。他要求美国无条件地撤出南越。
    西哈努克亲王说，中国和越南民主共和国都是柬埔寨的好朋友，它们不干涉柬埔寨内政，尊重柬埔寨主权。他驳斥了美国的这种谬论：美国一旦退出东南亚，象柬埔寨这样的国家便要面临“威胁”，只是由于在美国“援助”下反共，南越（西贡伪政权）和泰国等才能保持“自由”。他说，请大家看一看，在反共的幌子下，南越在美国傀儡吴庭艳、阮高其之流统治下变成了什么样子：“独立吗？零！自由吗？零！民主吗？零！自主吗？零！腐败吗？是的。”
    西哈努克亲王还谴责美国和它的仆从泰国和南越傀儡侵犯柬埔寨领土，轰炸和杀害柬埔寨居民。
    他说：“谁破坏我们的和平、中立、主权和领土完整？不是共产党人，而是美国人，亲美的泰国人，亲美的南越人和他们收买的‘自由高棉运动’。”
    西哈努克亲王说，柬埔寨决心维护自己的主权、独立、领土完整。只要美国不承认、不尊重柬埔寨的主权和边界，只要它继续侵犯柬埔寨领土，柬埔寨便不同它恢复外交关系。
