Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize power."

Just after the New Year, the Indian people's struggle against oppression and for survival has reached a new high.

In January, low-level employees and civil servants in India held nationwide and statewide strikes, demanding wage increases and better treatment. Early in the month, low-level employees in all Indian states went on strike for a day. By the end of the month, more than 300,000 civil servants held a nationwide strike for a week. Low-level employees in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh all held long-term strikes. These strikes plunged the reactionary government of India into chaos.

Early in February, 100,000 power workers in Andhra Pradesh went on strike. Tugboat operators and dock workers in Bombay also went on strike, paralyzing the port.

In many places, workers and government employees joined with students and teachers to hold demonstrations against the government. They bravely fought with the police who came to suppress them, setting fire to the offices of the Indian National Congress.

The broad masses of the Indian people hate the Indian National Congress, which represents the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landlords. This year, India is holding its fourth general election. Some leaders of the Indian National Congress who went to various places to deliver election speeches were met with opposition from angry crowds everywhere. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was hit with stones, breaking her nose and swelling her lips. The president of the Indian National Congress, Kamaraj, was hit in the forehead with a brick. The Indian people have seen through the hypocrisy of bourgeois parliamentary democracy. As the election day approaches, the Indian people's struggle against the Indian National Congress is becoming more intense.

The Indian people's large-scale mass struggle against oppression and for survival has been going on for more than a year.

The reactionary government of India, on the one hand, sends troops and police to carry out bloody suppression and mass arrests, and on the other hand, engages in political deception. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leaders provide money, food, and weapons to the Indian reactionary government, trying to support it. But all this is useless. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The Indian people's struggle is getting higher and higher, developing more and more, and the Indian people's awareness is also increasing.

The armed struggle of the Mizo and other ethnic minorities in northeastern India against the government has been continuing.

The Indian people will face difficulties and twists and turns on the road to struggle. But the wheel of history cannot be stopped by anyone. The day when the Indian people will thoroughly overthrow the Indian reactionaries will surely come.

### 印度人民斗争掀起新高潮

    印度人民斗争掀起新高潮
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    新年刚过，印度人民反暴政、争生存的斗争，又掀起了新的高潮。
    一月份，印度政府的低级雇员和公务员纷纷举行全国性和全邦性的罢工，要求增加工资，改善待遇。一月初，印度全国各邦政府的低级雇员罢工一天。一月底又有三十多万公务员举行一个星期的全国性罢工。比哈尔邦、北方邦、喀拉拉邦和安得拉邦政府的低级雇员，都举行了长期的罢工。这些罢工使印度反动政府的统治机构陷于一片混乱。
    二月初，安得拉邦十万电力工人举行罢工。孟买港的引水员、码头工人也举行了罢工，使港口完全瘫痪。
    在许多地方，工人、政府雇员同学生、教师结合起来举行反对政府的示威游行。他们英勇地同前来镇压的警察搏斗，放火烧国大党办事处。
    广大印度人民恨透了代表大资产阶级大地主利益的国大党。印度今年举行第四届大选，到各地去发表竞选演说的一些国大党头子，到处都遭到愤怒的群众的反对。印度总理英迪拉·甘地被石子打得鼻破唇肿。国大党主席卡马拉季被砖头打中了前额。印度人民已经越来越看清楚了资产阶级议会民主的虚伪性。随着大选日子的临近，印度人民反对国大党的斗争也更加剧烈。
    印度人民反暴政、争生存的大规模群众斗争，已经进行了一年多了。
    印度反动政府一面出动军队和警察进行血腥镇压和大规模逮捕，一面大搞政治欺骗。美帝国主义和苏修领导集团对印度反动政府又给钱，又给粮食，又给武器，竭力给它撑腰。但是，这一切都没有用处。有压迫，就有反抗。印度人民的斗争还是一浪比一浪高，越来越发展，印度人民的觉悟，也越来越提高了。
    印度东北部的米佐族等少数民族反抗政府的武装斗争，也一直在坚持着。
    印度人民在斗争的道路上还会有困难和曲折。但是，历史的车轮是谁也阻拦不住的。印度人民彻底打倒印度反动派的日子，一定会到来的。
