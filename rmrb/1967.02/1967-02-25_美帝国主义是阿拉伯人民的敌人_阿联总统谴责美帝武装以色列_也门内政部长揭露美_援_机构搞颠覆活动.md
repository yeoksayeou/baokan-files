U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the Arab people.

The President of the United Arab Republic condemns U.S. imperialism for arming Israel.

The Minister of the Interior of Yemen exposes the subversive activities of the U.S. "aid" organization.

New China News Agency, Cairo, February 22nd - President Nasser of the United Arab Republic attacked U.S. imperialism as the protector of Israel and a vicious enemy of the Arab people on the 22nd.

Nasser, in a speech at a mass rally at Cairo University, said: "The United States and Britain established Israel, protected Israel, and provided Israel with weapons."

Nasser, in criticizing the recent statement by the U.S. Secretary of State that "the United States considers itself responsible for Israel's security," pointed out: "The only thing the United States is missing is not declaring itself to be Israel."

Nasser also condemned the U.S. imperialist plot to concoct a so-called "Islamic Pact."

Nasser reaffirmed in his speech that the United Arab Republic supports the struggle of Palestine, occupied South Yemen, and the Arabian Gulf against imperialism, for national liberation and independence. He announced: The United Arab Republic cannot allow U.S. and British military aircraft to fly over its airspace to conduct activities mainly against the interests of the Arab nation.

New China News Agency, Sana'a - According to a report by the weekly "Revolution," the Interior Minister of Yemen, Muhammad Al-Ahnumi, exposed that the U.S. "Point Four Program" office in Yemen leads and funds spies to conduct sabotage activities against Yemen.

Al-Ahnumi, on the 16th, revealed this matter during a meeting with William Borghi, the head of the Arabian Peninsula Affairs Section of the U.S. State Department, and Dennis Moore, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Yemen.

Al-Ahnumi pointed out that according to the investigation, some staff members of the "Point Four Program" office, such as Mitchell Harries (an American), led and funded the spy organization. Al-Ahnumi also exposed that a subversive group was recently arrested in Taiz, where some Yemenis acted according to the instructions of the "Point Four Program" office; they also seized all the American-made weapons and explosives they had.

Al-Ahnumi pointed out that the United States must stop these activities.

The U.S. "Point Four Program," also known as the "Technical Assistance to Underdeveloped Areas Program," is used by the United States to infiltrate, control, and conduct espionage activities in the countries it "assists."

According to reports from Cairo newspapers, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Tunisia have recently been intensifying their plots to sabotage the Arab League.

The news says that these three countries are planning to establish a new organization with its headquarters in Amman or Tunis.

This planned organization will attempt to draw other Arab countries into it, thereby achieving the goal of sabotaging the Arab League.

The report says that Arab figures believe that this plan is designed to replace the failed "Islamic Pact." This pact is intended to serve U.S. imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

    新华社开罗二十二日电　阿联总统纳赛尔二十二日晚抨击美帝国主义是以色列的保护者，是阿拉伯人民的恶毒敌人。
    纳赛尔在开罗大学的一次群众集会上发表讲话时说：“美国和英国建立了以色列，保护以色列，并向以色列提供武器。”
    纳赛尔在抨击美国国务卿最近甚至宣布“美国认为它对以色列的安全负有责任”这一谈话时指出：“美国现在所差的只是没有宣布它自己就是以色列。”
    纳赛尔还谴责美帝国主义企图拼凑所谓“伊斯兰条约”的阴谋。
    纳赛尔在讲话中重申，阿联支持巴勒斯坦、被占领的南也门和阿拉伯湾进行的反对帝国主义、争取民族解放和独立的斗争。他宣布：阿联不能允许美国和英国的军用飞机飞越阿联领空，进行主要针对阿拉伯民族的利益的活动。
    新华社萨那电　据《革命报》（周刊）报道，也门内政部长穆罕默德·阿赫努米揭露美国在也门的“第四点计划”办事处领导和资助间谍分子，进行对也门的破坏活动。
    阿赫努米十六日在接见美国国务院阿拉伯半岛事务科科长威廉·博里吉和美国驻也门代办丹尼斯·穆尔时揭露了这件事。
    阿赫努米指出，根据调查，“第四点计划”办事处的一些人员，如米切尔·哈雷兹（美国籍），领导和资助了间谍组织。阿赫努米还揭露，最近在塔伊兹逮捕了一个颠覆集团，在那里，有些也门人按照“第四点计划”办事处的指示行事；还缴获了他们拥有的美国制造的全部武器和爆炸物。
    阿赫努米指出，美国必须停止这种活动。
    美国的“第四点计划”，即所谓“技术援助落后地区计划”，美国借这个计划，对受“援”国进行渗透、控制和间谍活动。
    本报讯　据开罗报纸报道，沙特阿拉伯、约旦和突尼斯三国最近正在加紧策划破坏阿拉伯联盟的新阴谋。
    消息说，这三个国家正在策划成立一个新的组织，总部设在安曼或突尼斯。
    这个策划中的组织将企图把其他阿拉伯国家拉进去，从而达到破坏阿拉伯联盟的目的。
    报道说，阿拉伯人士认为，制订这个计划，是为了阴谋取代已告失败的“伊斯兰条约”。这个条约是为美帝国主义侵略中东效劳的。
