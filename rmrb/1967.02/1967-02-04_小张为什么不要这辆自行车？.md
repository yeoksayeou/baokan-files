As soon as the bell rang to end the workday, Zhang Rui stopped his machine and rushed out without even washing his hands. What could have made this young man so eager? Half a month ago, the factory had given him a "back-pay" bonus. This money came as a surprise to Zhang Rui, like a gift from the sky. Zhang Rui took the "back-pay" home, and his mother suggested putting it in the bank. However, Zhang Rui begged his mother to buy him a bicycle. He had long wanted a bicycle. Thinking of her son's love for bicycles, and considering that riding to work would save the country money on transportation reimbursements, his mother agreed to Zhang Rui's request.

That day, Zhang Rui bought a new bicycle. With a canvas belt around his waist and a red armband labeled "Red Rebel" on his left arm, he rode his shiny new bicycle, ringing the bell enthusiastically and speeding forward.

That night, his mother woke him from his sleep: "Xiao Rui, get up quickly, the radio is broadcasting an important article." The announcer's clear voice echoed in the room: "Currently, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, are colluding with bourgeois elements, speculators, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society. They are using economism to deceive and incite the masses, disrupting production, financial management, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution..."

Hearing this, his mother suddenly asked Zhang Rui, "Who gave you the money to buy the bicycle?" "It was a comrade surnamed Zheng who is in charge." "Why did they specifically give you back-pay at this time?" his mother asked anxiously. "They said it was a regulation from higher authorities... and that it was the party and the leadership caring for me." At this, his mother interrupted Zhang Rui, seeming to understand: "Hmph, these scoundrels are up to new tricks! These guys use both hard and soft tactics on us revolutionary rebels, trying to bribe us with money. Xiao Rui, we must not fall for the enemy's tricks!"

That night, the radio broadcast and his mother's warnings kept the young man, not yet twenty, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.

The next morning, before dawn, Zhang Rui got up to go to work. As soon as he entered the factory gate, he noticed the atmosphere was different from usual. Overnight, the walls on both sides of the road in the big-character poster area were covered with slogans like "Smash bourgeois counter-revolutionary economism!" "Resolutely crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Stay alert and keep your eyes open, don't fall for the enemy's tricks!" Each slogan seemed like a warning bell ringing in Zhang Rui's heart. He immediately realized that bourgeois economism and the bicycle in his hands were inseparable. He pushed the bicycle, feeling like his legs were made of lead, and walked towards the workshop. The usually cheerful young man now felt the seriousness of the struggle. As he entered the workshop, he saw the Mao Zedong quotation board hanging on his lathe, which read: "There may be some communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns; they are truly heroes in front of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets. We must prevent this situation."

At that moment, Zhang Rui felt that every word on the quotation board was several times larger than usual. Chairman Mao's teachings suddenly made him see clearly. He punched his head fiercely and said angrily, "I fell for the enemy's sugar-coated bullets!" He glanced at the bicycle parked outside the door with disgust and firmly said to himself, "I must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and not take this bicycle. I must expose their crimes." Thinking this, he immediately went to his good friend Wang Xiaochun and said excitedly, "We have fallen for the enemy's sugar-coated bullets. The enemy is trying to buy us with money. Can we fall for their tricks?" Wang Xiaochun firmly said, "No! Come, let's return the money and the bicycle!"

The workers in the factory gathered around Zhang Rui, enthusiastically supporting his revolutionary action. Everyone shouted in unison: "Learn from Zhang Rui!" "Smash bourgeois counter-revolutionary economism!" "Resolutely crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" "We revolutionaries don't want money!" The roaring cheers mixed with the roar of the machines, like thunder rolling across the factory sky.

    小张为什么不要这辆自行车？
    工人　范金
    下班铃刚一响，停了机床，张瑞手也不洗就往外跑。是什么事使这个小伙子这么着急呢？原来，在半月前厂里发给他一笔“追补工资”，这笔钱对小张来说，来得突然，真象从天上掉下来的。小张把“追补工资”拿回家去，妈妈主张存在银行里，可是小张却央求妈妈买一辆自行车。提起买自行车，可真是小张好长时间的心愿了。妈妈想到儿子这么爱车，再说骑车子上班还能为国家节约车费报销，妈妈也就答应了小张的要求。
    这天，小张买到新车，腰里扎着一条帆布腰带，左臂带着“红色造反者”的红袖章，骑在崭新的自行车上，一个劲儿的摇着铃铛，飞快地往前驰去。……
    当天晚上，妈妈从睡梦中把小张叫醒：“小瑞，快起来，收音机里在广播重要文章。”广播员同志清晰的声音在房里回响：“当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，正在和社会上的资产阶级分子，投机倒把分子，地、富、反、坏、右分子，互相勾结起来，用经济主义来欺骗群众，煽动群众，破坏生产，破坏财政金融，破坏无产阶级文化大革命……。”听到这里，妈妈突然问小张：“你买车子的钱是谁给你的？”“是一个姓郑的当权派。”“他们为什么单单在这个时候给你们追补工资？”妈妈焦急地问。“他们说是上级的规定……，还说什么这是党和领导对我的关怀。”这时，妈妈打断了小张的话头，若有所悟地说：“嘿，准是这帮坏蛋又在玩弄新花招！这些家伙对咱们革命造反派硬一套软一套，想用钱来勾引咱们革命造反派，小瑞，咱们就是不能上敌人的当！”这天夜里，收音机里的广播和妈妈的叮嘱，使这个不满二十岁的年青人翻来覆去睡不着觉。
    第二天早晨，天刚蒙蒙亮，张瑞就起床上班了。当他走进厂门口，立刻发现气氛与平常大不相同，一夜之间马路两旁的大字报园地里都贴满了“粉碎资产阶级反革命经济主义！”“坚决打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！”“提高警惕擦亮眼睛，不要上敌人的当！”等巨幅标语。不知为什么，每张标语好象是一声声警钟震动着小张的心，他立刻意识到资产阶级的经济主义同自己手里推着的自行车是那么不可分割。他推着自行车，两腿象灌了铅似的向车间走去。这个平时爱说爱笑的小伙子，现在顿时感到斗争的严重性。他走进车间，一眼就看见了挂在自己刨床上的毛主席语录牌，上面写着：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”此刻，小张觉得语录牌上的每个字比平时大了几倍，毛主席的教导使他突然变得眼明心亮了。他用拳头朝头上猛击一下，忿恨地说：“我中了敌人的糖衣炮弹！”他用厌恶的目光瞥了下放在门外的自行车，果断地自语：“我要坚决听毛主席的话，不能要这辆自行车，我要控诉他们的罪行。”想到这里，他立刻走到好朋友王小春跟前，激动地说：“我们中了敌人的糖衣炮弹了，小王，敌人企图用金钱收买我们，我们能上敌人的当吗？”王小春坚决地说：“不能！走，我们把钱和车子交回去！”
    厂里的工人同志围住小张，热烈支持他的革命行动，大家纷纷高呼：“向张瑞同志学习！”“粉碎资产阶级反革命经济主义！”
  “坚决打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！”“我们革命不要钱！”……响彻云霄的欢呼声同机器的轰鸣交响在一起，象一阵阵响雷在工厂的上空滚动着。
