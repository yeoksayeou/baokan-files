In the unyielding struggle against American imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism, many Japanese people have emerged as activists who diligently study Chairman Mao's works. They draw boundless wisdom and strength from Mao Zedong Thought, raising their political awareness and revolutionary consciousness, and bravely charging into the fray to overcome difficulties and strive for victory.

Kashiwagi is a renowned surgeon who holds deep love and respect for Chairman Mao and strives to study his works. Many years ago, he purchased a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Now, he has added a new, radiant copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to his collection. Kashiwagi said, "Chairman Mao is a great Marxist-Leninist. I have developed the habit of turning to the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' or the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' whenever I encounter problems, to see how Chairman Mao would address them."

Last summer, when a small clique of revisionists in Japan, under the guise of 'Japan-China friendship,' viciously obstructed and sabotaged the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival and the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, Kashiwagi, who had just returned from leading a delegation to China, immediately joined the fight. He engaged in fierce struggle with those revisionists who sought to disrupt Japan-China friendship. When he saw that some progressive women in Fukuoka Prefecture were facing difficulties in their struggle, he quoted Chairman Mao's teaching: "In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see light, and boost our morale." He encouraged and supported them, helping them rally the masses to drive out the revisionists and raise the first banner of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) in Japan.

Kashiwagi also analyzed the new situation of the struggle after the establishment of the association, following Chairman Mao's instructions. He said: "The establishment of a new organization inevitably encounters many problems. However, I believe that as long as we rely on Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the truth, there is nothing we cannot achieve. More people will support us and unite around us."

Kashiwagi particularly loves reading Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune." This time, he specially brought back a set of photographs of Norman Bethune's activities during his lifetime from China. He said, "This time in China, I felt everywhere the spirit of Norman Bethune among the Chinese people, which is the spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people and internationalism." He said, "I am a doctor, and I must respond well to Chairman Mao's call to learn from Norman Bethune." In his conversation with a Chinese journalist, Kashiwagi expressed his deep longing: "The greatest wish of my life is to meet Chairman Mao once and shake his hand." He concluded, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

On the third anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talk on Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against American Imperialism and for National Liberation," the Japanese people held an anti-American demonstration in Iwakuni, where there is a U.S. military base. Among the demonstrators was a young Japanese activist who diligently studies the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." On his way from Shimonioseki to Iwakuni, he studied the part of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on "self-reliance and arduous struggle" in the car. When discussing his study insights, he said, "If I want to revolutionize and fight for the liberation of the Japanese people and youth, I will inevitably encounter many difficulties and setbacks. The road ahead is not smooth. Now, not only do imperialism and reactionaries sabotage our struggle, but Japanese revisionists also cause trouble. However, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We should always propagate to the people the progressive situation and bright future of the world, so that the people can build up confidence in victory. At the same time, we must also tell the people, tell our comrades, that the road is tortuous.' 'We and all the people unite and strive together, and we will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve victory.'"

"In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see light, and boost our morale."

This young man uses Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to observe various issues in Japan's current struggle, effectively refuting some absurd points made by Japanese modern revisionists. He said that a small clique of Japanese revisionists claim that "Japan is a highly developed capitalist country," and therefore, "relying on the majority in parliament, one can carry out a revolution." This is completely contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. He said that parliament is a tool used by the ruling class to promote false democracy and deceive the masses, and one should not harbor any illusions about it. To revolutionize, one must fully mobilize the masses to engage in revolutionary struggle and strike hard at the enemy.

This young Japanese man works as a newspaper delivery person at a progressive newspaper office and is only twenty years old. He lost his father at the age of ten and, to help his mother raise his younger siblings, started working while studying. He has experienced the pain of exploitation by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and hates the capitalist society that devours people, as well as the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and their accomplices—the modern revisionists. Last year, he received a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a member of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe. Since then, he has frequently studied this precious book and written thought diaries by comparing his actions with Chairman Mao's teachings, using Mao Zedong Thought as his guide for struggle and action. He said, "Our work now is to serve the liberation of the Japanese people. We must play the role of the Japanese Red Guards." He said, "Some Chinese youth have read the 'Three Articles' thousands of times. We, living in the capitalist society of Japan, cannot just read it once or twice. We must also read the 'Three Articles' thousands, tens of thousands of times. We must thoroughly eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness to better serve the Japanese people and the Japanese revolution."

    活学活用毛主席著作积极投入革命斗争
    日本许多革命群众努力学习毛泽东思想提高觉悟勇敢战斗
    新华社东京电　在不屈不挠地坚持进行反对美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义斗争的日本人民中，涌现了一些在斗争中努力学习毛主席著作的积极分子，他们从毛泽东思想汲取到无限智慧和力量，提高了政治认识和革命觉悟，一往直前地投入斗争，排除困难去争取胜利。
    柏木是一位著名的外科医生，他对毛主席无限热爱，无限崇敬，并且努力学习毛主席著作。早在好些年以前，他就买了一套《毛泽东选集》，现在又新增加了一册红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。柏木说：“毛主席是一位伟大的马克思列宁主义者。我现在已经养成习惯，遇到问题就学习《毛泽东选集》或《毛主席语录》，看看毛主席是怎样说的。”
    去年夏天，当日本一小撮修正主义分子打着“日中友好”的幌子，丧心病狂地阻挠和破坏第二届日中青年友好大联欢和中国经济贸易展览会的时候，刚刚率领一个代表团到中国访问后回到日本的柏木，立即投入了战斗，同那些破坏日中友好的一小撮修正主义分子展开激烈的斗争。当他看到福冈县一些先进的妇女们在斗争中遇到困难时，就引用毛主席的“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”这一教导来鼓励她们，支持她们，使她们勇气百倍地发动群众，把修正主义分子驱逐出去，在日本首先树起了第一面日中友好协会（正统）联合会的旗帜。
    柏木还按照毛主席的指示，来分析联合会成立后斗争的新形势。他说：一个新组织的成立，不可避免地会遇到许多问题。但是，我认为不管遇到什么困难，只要我们依靠毛泽东思想，只要我们坚持真理，就没有办不到的事情，就一定会有更多的人支持我们，团结在我们的周围。
    柏木特别爱读毛主席写的《纪念白求恩》。他这次特地从中国带回了一套白求恩生前活动的照片。他说：“我这一次去中国，到处感受到中国人民的白求恩精神，就是完全地彻底地为人民服务的精神和国际主义的精神”。他说：“我是个医生，我要很好地响应毛主席的号召向白求恩学习”。柏木在同中国记者谈话时，以一种无限向往的心情说：“我一生中最大的愿望是能够见到一次毛主席，同他老人家握一次手。”他最后“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    在毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表三周年那一天，日本人民在设有美军基地的岩国市举行了反美示威。在示威者当中有一位积极学习《毛主席语录》的日本青年，他在从下关到岩国市的途中，就在汽车上学习了《毛主席语录》关于“自力更生，艰苦奋斗”这一部分。他谈到他的学习心得时说，我要革命，要为日本人民和青年的解放而斗争，就必定会遇到许多困难和挫折，在前进过程中是不可能有平坦的直路的。现在，不仅帝国主义和反动派破坏我们的斗争，还有日本的修正主义者也来捣乱。但是，毛主席教导我们：“我们应当把世界进步的情况和光明的前途，常常向人民宣传，使人民建立起胜利的信心。同时，我们还要告诉人民，告诉同志们，道路是曲折的。”“我们和全体人民团结起来，共同努力，一定能够排除万难，达到胜利的目的。”
  “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    这位青年运用毛泽东思想作为观察日本当前斗争中各种问题的指针，有力地驳斥了日本的现代修正主义者的一些荒谬论点。他说，日本一小撮修正主义者们胡说什么“日本是一个高度发达的资本主义国家”，因此，“依靠在议会中的多数，可以进行革命”，这是完全违背毛泽东思想的。他说，议会是统治阶级推行假民主、欺骗人民群众的工具，对它不能抱任何幻想。要革命就必须充分发动群众进行革命斗争，狠狠地打击敌人。
    这位日本青年在一家进步报社担任送报工作，今年才二十岁。他在十岁时就死了父亲，为了帮助母亲抚养弟弟妹妹，他很小就一边念书一边劳动。他尝够了美日反动派的压榨所带来的痛苦，恨透了吃人的资本主义社会，恨透了美日反动派及其帮凶——现代修正主义。他在去年得到了中国北京歌舞团的同志送给他的一本《毛主席语录》，以后他就经常学习这本宝书，并且对照毛主席的教导写思想日记，以毛泽东思想作为自己斗争和行动的指南。他说，我们现在的工作是为日本人民的解放服务的，我们要起日本红卫兵的作用。他说，有些中国青年把“老三篇”学过千百遍，我们生活在资本主义社会的日本，只读一两遍是不行的。我们也应当把“老三篇”读几千遍，几万遍。必须彻底破私立公，才能很好地为日本人民服务，为日本的革命服务。
