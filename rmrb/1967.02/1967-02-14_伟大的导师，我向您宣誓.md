A journalist from Nepal recently wrote a poem, passionately praising the great teacher Chairman Mao. In this poem titled "In This Struggle, Teacher, I Promise You," he writes:

Friends, following Marx and Lenin, look, humanity has a new teacher, Chairman Mao! For us, he is not only the leader of China, but also the leader of all oppressed peoples! The history of revolution and the people will never fade, and Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings on revolution and the people will forever remain youthful, forever pushing the revolution forward! We are admirers of Marx and Lenin, and we proudly declare: We will prove with our actions, not empty words, that we are also loyal admirers of Chairman Mao! We promise you, Chairman Mao, our teacher: We will fight the U.S. imperialists to the end! The farmers and youth of Nepal love and respect you deeply! In this struggle, teacher, I promise you: All revolutionaries support the new revolution in China!
