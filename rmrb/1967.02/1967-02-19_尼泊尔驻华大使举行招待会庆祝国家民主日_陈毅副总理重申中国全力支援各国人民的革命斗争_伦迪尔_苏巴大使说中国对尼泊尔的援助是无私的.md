Nepalese Ambassador to China, Rendi Subba, hosted a reception tonight to celebrate the National Democracy Day of the Kingdom of Nepal.

At the reception, filled with a friendly atmosphere, Ambassador Rendi Subba and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke, wishing for the continued development of friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized in his speech that imperialism, modern revisionism, and their followers maliciously attack China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and frenziedly sing anti-China songs. They even clamor that China will change its foreign policy, attempting to sow discord between China and Asian and African countries. Such plots are in vain. The Chinese people stand with the peoples of Asia, Africa, and all oppressed peoples around the world, and fully support their revolutionary struggles. This policy is steadfast and will not change under any circumstances.

Attending the reception by invitation were Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the China-Nepal Friendship Association Zhou Jianren, as well as relevant officials from China and representatives of revolutionary rebels.

Ambassador Rendi Subba spoke about Nepal's achievements in national construction and its policy of non-alignment and strict neutrality in foreign affairs.

The Ambassador said, "Our country's relationship with China can be traced back thousands of years. In recent years, this friendly connection has been greatly strengthened. We believe this connection will be consolidated and developed. Our friendship with China is based on goodwill and neighborliness, mutual respect for each other's systems, and a commitment to non-interference in each other's internal affairs."

He said, "China's aid to Nepal is selfless. Although we value China's aid, we cherish even more the spirit behind this aid. Chinese technical personnel in Nepal have won friends with their modest attitudes, work efficiency, and especially their brotherly actions."

The Ambassador concluded by saying, "As good friends and neighbors, we are happy to see the great progress China is making in all fields of human activity."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed warm congratulations to the government and people of the Kingdom of Nepal, and stated that the Chinese people firmly support the Nepalese people in their struggle to maintain national dignity and resist foreign interference. He sincerely wished the Nepalese people greater achievements on the path of independent development.

He said, "In recent years, the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal has been further strengthened. Mutual visits by leaders of the two countries and equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation have continuously promoted the development of friendly relations between the two countries. It is worth celebrating that the Kathmandu-Kodari Highway is about to be fully operational, which is a crystallization of the friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal. It will serve as a bond of friendship connecting our Tibet Autonomous Region and the northern region of Nepal, making an important contribution to strengthening friendly ties between the two countries and promoting economic prosperity."

He said, "Just now, the Ambassador mentioned China's support and aid to Nepal. We believe that supporting the national independence and liberation of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is an internationalist duty of the Chinese people. The struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and great-power chauvinism is also the greatest support for the Chinese people. The Nepalese government and people have consistently opposed imperialism's schemes to create 'two Chinas' and subvert our Tibet. For this, I wish to express our heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese government and people."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Currently, our unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of struggle for power by the revolutionary masses. This is a great initiative of significant international importance to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country, and a fatal blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and their followers are terrified and trembling."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: 'We, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who love freedom and independence, are all fighting against colonialism. ... The colonialists hope that we will not unite, not cooperate, not be friendly. We must respond to them by strengthening unity, friendship, and cooperation. We must make the colonialists' plots completely fail.' Chairman Mao also taught us: 'In international exchanges, the Chinese people must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate great-power chauvinism.' The Chinese people will firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, strengthen Asian-African solidarity, and deepen friendly neighborly relations with Nepal on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and strive for the support of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world, and fight to the end against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism."

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    伦迪尔·苏巴大使说中国对尼泊尔的援助是无私的
    新华社十八日讯　尼泊尔驻中国大使伦迪尔·苏巴今晚举行招待会，庆祝尼泊尔王国国家民主日。
    在充满友好气氛的招待会上，伦迪尔·苏巴大使和国务院副总理陈毅先后讲话，共祝中尼两国人民的友谊不断向前发展。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中强调说，帝国主义、现代修正主义及其追随者恶毒地攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，疯狂地进行反华大合唱，还叫嚷什么中国要改变外交政策，妄图挑拨中国和亚非国家的友好关系。这种阴谋是枉费心机的。中国人民同亚非人民和全世界被压迫人民站在一起，并且全力支援他们的革命斗争，这个政策是坚定不移的，是在任何情况下都决不会改变的。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有国务院副总理李先念，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，人大常委会副委员长、中尼友协会长周建人，以及我国各有关方面的负责人和革命造反派代表。
    伦迪尔·苏巴大使在讲话中谈到了尼泊尔在国家建设事业中取得的成就，谈到了尼泊尔奉行的不结盟和严格中立的外交政策。
    大使说，我国与中国的关系可以追溯到几千年以前。近几年来，这种友好联系已经大大加强。我们相信这种联系将得到巩固和发展。我们与中国的友谊，是建立在亲善与睦邻，互相尊重对方的制度以及绝不相互干涉内政的基础上的。
    他说，中国对尼泊尔的援助是无私的，尽管我们重视中国的援助，但我们更为珍视的却是这种援助的精神。在尼泊尔的中国技术人员用他们的谦虚态度，工作效率，尤其是他们的兄弟般的行动赢得了朋友。
    大使最后说，作为好朋友和邻居，我们为中国在人类活动的各领域正在取得的巨大进展感到高兴。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中代表中国政府和人民，向尼泊尔王国政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺，并表示中国人民坚决支持尼泊尔人民维护祖国尊严和反对外来干涉的斗争，衷心祝愿尼泊尔人民在独立发展的道路上取得更大的成就。
    他说，近几年来，中尼两国人民的传统友谊有了进一步的加强。两国政府领导人的互相访问和平等互利的经济合作，使两国的友好关系不断向前发展。值得高兴的是，加德满都—科达里公路即将全线通车，这是中尼人民友谊的结晶。它将成为联结我国西藏自治区和尼泊尔北部地区的一条友谊的纽带，对加强两国的友好联系和促进两国的经济繁荣做出重要的贡献。
    他说，刚才大使先生提到中国对尼泊尔的支持和援助。我们认为，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立解放，是中国人民应尽的国际主义义务。而亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和大国沙文主义的斗争，也是对中国人民的最大支持。尼泊尔政府和人民一贯反对帝国主义制造“两个中国”和颠覆我国西藏的阴谋。对此，我愿代表中国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    陈毅副总理说，当前我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经进入无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的新阶段。这是防止在我国出现修正主义和资本主义复辟的具有重大国际意义的一个伟大创举，是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的致命打击。帝国主义、现代修正主义及其追随者怕得要命，吓得发抖。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“我们亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好自由和独立的人民，都在反对殖民主义。……殖民主义者希望我们不团结，不合作，不友好。我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。”毛主席还教导我们说：“中国人在国际交往方面，应当坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭大国主义。”中国人民坚决按照毛主席的指示，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，加强亚非团结，密切同尼泊尔的友好睦邻关系，为支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和现代修正主义而奋斗到底。
    各国驻中国的使节也应邀出席了招待会。
