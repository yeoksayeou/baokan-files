We ten sisters in the militia squad are mostly from poor peasant backgrounds. It is Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering. We are deeply grateful to Chairman Mao, love Chairman Mao, and admire Chairman Mao. We poor peasants love to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

It is Chairman Mao who gave us boundless strength, enabling most of us in the squad to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and have engaged in a tenacious struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there still remain enemies without guns. They are bound to struggle to the death with us. We must never underestimate these enemies." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are currently conducting is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Since last August, we have been supporting revolutionary students. Several of us often go to the streets to read big-character posters, attend meetings at the rebel headquarters, and participate in debates. We have made up our minds: we will forever be steadfast revolutionaries!

However, some people in the commune party committee and the brigade party branch said that revolutionary students are "counter-revolutionaries," that we have been poisoned by the students, and that we are a "counter-revolutionary clique." They sent people to monitor us, forbade us from going to the streets to read big-character posters, forbade us from contacting students, and compiled black materials on us, labeling us as "counter-revolutionaries." The poor peasants' association also did not allow me to participate, saying that our ten sisters' militia squad had produced five "traitors," and that the provincial, municipal, and county committees would reorganize our ten sisters' militia squad, and so on.

At that time, we were in the minority, but we were not afraid of anything because the truth was on our side. Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is work? Work is struggle." We have the most powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how great the pressure is, we can withstand it!

The handful of power-holders within the party, who are taking the capitalist road, saw that their old tricks could not subdue us, so they became even more resentful. They played new tricks, using so-called "debate meetings" to fight against us. But we have resolved to defend Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao to the death! Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes the proletarian revolutionary line, we will fight to the death with them! We are not afraid of death, so why should we be afraid of struggle? Chairman Mao says: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons must be criticized. We must not allow them to spread freely." If you want to hold "debate meetings," we will criticize your bourgeois reactionary line and expose all your evil deeds in broad daylight! Such "debate meetings" were held six times, and each time we fought resolutely and won over the masses. This time, they failed again.

On October 1, last year, they gathered our brigade's armed militia, preparing to "defend" the municipal and county committees and suppress revolutionary students. They were afraid that we would cause trouble, so they gathered several of us in the brigade office and guarded us for two days and two nights. In this difficult environment, we repeatedly studied the "Sixteen Points" and the editorials of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. We became even more convinced that the revolutionary students' general direction has always been correct, and our general direction has always been correct. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In times of difficulty, our comrades should see achievements, see light, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's instructions gave us great encouragement. We are not afraid of anything, and victory will surely be ours.

The brigade party branch secretary, seeing that force did not work, tried soft tactics. He said that it was the municipal committee that had cultivated us, and we had forgotten our roots. We said, it was Chairman Mao who cultivated us, and you are the ones who truly forgot your roots! He then hypocritically said that he did not want an active element to fall. We said, we have not fallen, but rather, we have truly stood up. He said again that we led the study of Chairman Mao's works well in the team, and that we were selected to go to the commune to attend a lecture meeting, and even lent us a bicycle. I said, I will not be hit by your sugar-coated bullets! Revolution is not for showing off, not for enjoyment, and certainly not for seeking official positions and wealth. What we think of is not personal gain, but the fate of the party and the country. We think of all of China, all of the world!

Because Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao firmly support the revolutionary rebels, we have now achieved initial victory. But this is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and persist in struggling to the end. We are currently propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line among the broad masses of peasants, and are mobilizing the peasant masses, especially the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, to the greatest extent possible, to thoroughly smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely forge a red new countryside!

    闯出个红彤彤的新农村
    扬州市要武（原双桥）大队十姐妹民兵班班长　王瑞英
    我们十姐妹班大多数人都是贫下中农出身，是毛主席把我们从苦海里救出来的。我们从心眼里感谢毛主席，热爱毛主席，崇拜毛主席。我们贫下中农最爱读毛主席的书，最爱听毛主席的话。我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。
    是毛主席给了我们无穷的力量，使我们全班大多数人，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，都能坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和那些顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人进行了顽强的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”当前所进行的这场文化大革命，就是无产阶级和资产阶级之间极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。我们就是要听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    去年八月以后，我们就一直支持革命学生。我们几个人经常上街看大字报，到造反楼开会，参加辩论。我们下定决心：永远做一个坚定的革命造反派！
    但是，公社党委和大队党支部的某些人却说革命学生是“反革命”，说我们是中了学生们的“毒”，把我们看成“反革命集团”，派人监视我们，不准我们上街看大字报，不准和学生接触，大搞我们的黑材料，把我们打成“反革命”。贫协会也不让我参加了，还说什么我们十姐妹民兵班出了五个“叛徒”，省、地、市委要改组我们十姐妹民兵班，等等。
    那时我们是少数，但是我们什么也不怕，因为真理在我们手里。毛主席教导我们说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”我们有毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，不管你压力有多大，我们都能顶得住！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派眼看他们原来的那一套不能把我们压服，就更加怀恨在心。他们玩弄新的阴谋，用开什么“辩论会”来斗争我们。但是我们誓死保卫毛主席，保卫以毛主席为首的党中央的决心是下定了！谁反对毛主席，谁反对无产阶级革命路线，就和谁拚！我们死都不怕，还怕“斗争”？毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”你们要开“辩论会”，我们就批判你们的资产阶级反动路线，把你们所干的罪恶勾当统统揭发出来，暴露在光天化日之下！这样的“辩论会”进行了六次，每次我们都作了坚决的斗争，争取了群众。这一下，他们又失败了。
    去年十月一日，他们集合我们大队武装民兵，准备去“保卫”地委、市委，镇压革命学生。他们害怕我们要去捣乱，就把我们几个人集中在大队部，看守了两天两夜。在这困难的环境下，我们又反复学习了“十六条”和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志社论。我们更加坚信，革命学生的大方向始终没有错，我们的大方向始终也是正确的。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的指示给了我们极大的鼓舞。我们什么也不怕，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    大队党支部书记见硬的不行，就来软的，他说什么是市委把我们培养起来的，我们忘本了。我们说，是毛主席把我们培养起来的，你们才是真正的忘本呢！他又假惺惺地说，他不希望一个积极分子倒下去。我们说，我们并没有倒下去，相反地倒是真正站起来了。他又说，你在队里领导学习毛主席著作很好，把你选到公社去开讲用会，还借自行车给你。我说，我决不给你的糖衣炮弹打中！革命不是为了出风头，不是为了享受，更不是为了升官发财。我们想到的决不是个人的私利，而是党和国家命运的大事。我们想的是全中国，全世界！
    由于毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央坚决支持革命造反派，现在我们已经取得了初步的胜利。但是，这只是万里长征才走完第一步。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持斗争到底。我们正在向广大农民群众宣传贯彻毛主席的革命路线，尽可能地把农民群众特别是广大贫下中农进一步发动起来，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。我们一定要在毛泽东思想的指引下，杀出个红彤彤的新农村来！
