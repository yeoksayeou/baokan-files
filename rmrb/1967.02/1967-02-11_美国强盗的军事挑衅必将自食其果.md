On February 8th and 9th, U.S. military aircraft consecutively violated our airspace five times. After our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson issued a stern warning, they again violated our airspace four times on the 10th. This is a new and serious military provocation by U.S. imperialism against our country.

This time, the U.S. Department of Defense, in an unusual move, issued a statement after U.S. military aircraft entered our airspace over the Yulin region of Hainan Island, claiming it was due to a "navigation error" and that they had "accidentally flown in." This is a complete lie, a thief's logic.

In just three days, the Johnson administration dispatched bandit aircraft to consecutively violate our airspace nine times. Are all of these due to "navigation errors" and "accidental entries"? After our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a stern warning, they continued to invade and provoke. Are these also "accidental entries"? The bandits want to do evil deeds and escape responsibility; they shout "mistake" while repeatedly breaking into someone else's home to rob. This once again exposes the ugly face of U.S. imperialism as both a bandit and a cheat to the people of the world.

During the new high tide of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, U.S. imperialism shamelessly provoked us consecutively. This is completely planned and purposeful, with malicious intent and long-term scheming. Johnson and his ilk, listen up: Do you want to test the strength of our national defense? Do you want to gain something from our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? Let me tell you, the Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with their revolutionary spirit greatly invigorated during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are an invincible force. If you mistakenly assess the situation and dare to stick your dog's head in, you will only reap what you sow and be smashed to pieces, not even a drop of oil will you get.

The consecutive provocations by U.S. imperialism have aroused the extreme indignation of the people and soldiers of the entire nation. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never relax our fighting spirit," is vigilantly standing on the battlefront to defend our motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely watching the enemy's every move. If U.S. imperialism and its accomplices dare to invade, whether from the sky, land, or sea, we will annihilate them all.

    美国强盗的军事挑衅必将自食其果
    《解放军报》评论员
    二月八日、九日，美国军用飞机接连五次侵犯我国领空，在我国外交部发言人奉命提出严重警告之后，又在十日四次侵入我国领空。这是美帝国主义对我国新的严重的军事挑衅。
    这次，美国国防部一反常态，在美国军用飞机侵入我国海南岛榆林地区领空之后，竟然急急忙忙地发表声明，胡说什么是“由于航向错误”而“误飞入”的。这是彻头彻尾的谎言，强盗逻辑。
    三天之内，约翰逊政府派遣强盗飞机连续九次侵犯我国领空，难道这都是由于什么“航向错误”而“误飞入”的吗？在我国外交部提出严重警告之后，又继续入侵挑衅，难道这也是什么“误飞入”吗？强盗又要大干坏事，又要逃避罪责；一面嘴里喊着误会误会，一面又一而再，再而三地闯进人家家里抢劫，这就又一次把美国帝国主义的强盗加骗子手的丑恶嘴脸，赤裸裸地暴露在全世界人民的面前。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，美帝国主义肆无忌惮地连续挑衅，这完全是有计划有目的地干的，是包藏祸心、蓄谋已久的。约翰逊之流的帝国主义野兽们听着：你们是不是想要试探我们国防的强大威力？是不是想在我国无产阶级文化大革命中捞点什么油水？老实告诉你们，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，在无产阶级文化大革命中革命精神大大焕发起来的中国人民，是天下无敌的力量。你们如果错误地估计形势，胆敢把狗头伸进来，就只会自食其果，就只会被砸得粉碎，半点油星子也休想捞到。
    美帝国主义的连续挑衅，激起了全国人民和全军指战员的无比愤慨。中国人民解放军遵照毛主席“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”的教导，正警惕地站在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战斗岗位上，密切注视着敌人的一举一动。美帝国主义及其帮凶胆敢来侵犯，不管它从天上来，从地上来，从海上来，都要通通把它消灭掉。
