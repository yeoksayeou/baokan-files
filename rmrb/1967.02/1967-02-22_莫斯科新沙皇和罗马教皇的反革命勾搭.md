Recently, one of the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique, Podgorny, actually went to visit the Vatican, which has historically been an enemy of the Soviet people, and had a long, intimate conversation with Pope Paul VI. For someone who claims to be a Marxist-Leninist to go to the Vatican to "pay homage" to the reactionary Pope of Rome is the behavior of a complete traitor!

Lifting the lid, we see that Podgorny's visit to the Vatican was not without reason. This visit coincided with a time when U.S. imperialism was facing increasing difficulties on the battlefields of South Vietnam, when it was desperately trying to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation with its "bombing for peace" plot. This visit also came just before Kosygin's visit to London, where he met with British Prime Minister Wilson in a secret meeting to plot how to serve U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy. At this time, the Pope of Rome also hypocritically came out to sing praises and pray for the U.S. aggressors' "bombing for peace" scheme. What was Podgorny colluding with the Pope of Rome for? Isn't it crystal clear?

The Vatican has always been an enemy of the Soviet people and all revolutionary people around the world. Even before the October Revolution, the Pope of Rome was closely aligned with the brutal Russian Tsar, ruthlessly suppressing the revolutionary movements of the Russian people. After the October Revolution, the Vatican not only actively participated in the armed intervention against the Soviet Union but also used the church to carry out counter-revolutionary activities within the Soviet Union. In 1930, the Vatican launched the infamous "anti-Soviet crusade," attempting to strangle the young Soviet Socialist Republic. During World War II, the Vatican was also a accomplice of the fascist Axis powers, working with Hitler's Germany to carry out mad anti-Soviet activities...

The Vatican has always been aligned with the most reactionary forces in the world, using the cloak of religion to carry out anti-people, counter-revolutionary activities. After World War II, it was most closely aligned with U.S. imperialism, which admitted, "The Vatican's intelligence agency is the best in the world."

Chairman Mao said: "Those who stand on the side of the revolutionary people are revolutionaries, and those who stand on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism are counter-revolutionaries." Today, the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique openly stand on the side of counter-revolution, shaking hands and making friends with the Pope of Rome, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Soviet people and revolutionary people around the world. Their treacherous faces, betraying Lenin, betraying the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world, are fully exposed.

Everyone remembers that before Khrushchev was overthrown, he tried his best to establish a "close relationship" with the Pope of Rome, shamelessly wishing the Pope a happy new year. He sent his son-in-law Adzhubei and daughter to pay their respects to the Pope. Adzhubei bowed and saluted the Pope, while Khrushchev's daughter disgustingly said, "The Pope has a pair of genuine peasant's hands, just like my father's." What a complete lackey! But Khrushchev still did not dare to openly visit. However, his faithful successor Podgorny went without hesitation to "make a pilgrimage." It is clear that the new leadership of the Soviet revisionists is doing even worse than Khrushchev. They have gone even further down the path of counter-revolution than their predecessor Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "In this world, there is no love without reason, and there is no hatred without reason." The Soviet revisionist clique's intimate collusion with the enemies of the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world will inevitably make them enemies of the Soviet people at home and betray the interests of the revolutionary people of the world abroad. We must warn Brezhnev, Kosygin, Podgorny, and the new Tsars of the Kremlin: traitors will never have a good ending. Kautsky was like this, Bernstein was like this, Khrushchev was like this, and you will also inevitably face the judgment of the Soviet people and the fate of downfall.

### 莫斯科新沙皇和罗马教皇的反革命勾搭

    莫斯科新沙皇和罗马教皇的反革命勾搭
    最近，苏修统治集团头目之一波德戈尔内，居然前去访问历史上一贯与苏联人民为敌的梵蒂冈教廷，同教皇保罗六世进行了长时间的亲密会谈。一个自称“马列主义者”的人，跑到梵蒂冈去“朝拜”反动透顶的罗马教皇，这是十足的叛徒行为！
    揭开盖子来看一看，原来波德戈尔内访问梵蒂冈，是事出有因的。这次访问，正好是美帝国主义在南越战场上处境日益困难，大搞“以炸压和”，妄图扼杀越南人民抗美救国斗争的大阴谋的时候。这次访问，也正是在柯西金访问伦敦，同英国首相威尔逊开黑会，策划如何为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋效劳的前夕。在这个时期，罗马教皇也道貌岸然地出来为美国侵略者“以炸压和”的毒计唱赞歌，做祷告。波德戈尔内和罗马教皇勾勾搭搭，究竟是为了什么，难道不是一清二楚的吗？
    梵蒂冈是苏联人民和全世界革命人民的死敌。早在十月革命前，罗马教皇就同残暴的俄国沙皇紧密地勾结在一起，疯狂镇压俄国人民的革命运动。十月革命后，梵蒂冈不但积极参与了对苏联的武装干涉，而且利用教会在苏联境内大搞反革命活动。一九三○年，梵蒂冈发动了有名的“反苏十字军”，企图扼杀年青的苏维埃社会主义共和国。第二次世界大战期间，梵蒂冈又是法西斯轴心国家的帮凶，同希特勒德国一起进行疯狂的反苏活动……。
    梵蒂冈历来都是同世界上最反动的势力勾结在一起，披着宗教外衣，干尽反人民、反革命的勾当。第二次世界大战后，它与美帝勾结最紧，美帝不打自招地供认，“梵蒂冈的谍报机关是世界上最好的。”
    毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”今天，苏修领导集团的头目公然站在反革命一边，同双手沾满了苏联人民和世界革命人民鲜血的罗马教皇握手言欢。他们背叛列宁、背叛苏联人民和世界革命人民的丑恶嘴脸，真是暴露无遗了。
    大家都记得，赫鲁晓夫下台之前就竭力设法同罗马教皇建立“亲密关系”，无耻地向教皇祝贺新年。他曾派遣女婿阿朱别伊和女儿去拜见教皇。阿朱别伊向教皇鞠躬敬礼，而赫鲁晓夫的女儿竟肉麻地对人说：“教皇有一双十足的农民的大手，就象我父亲的那双手一样。”真是一副十足的奴才相！但赫鲁晓夫毕竟还不敢露骨地亲临拜访。然而他的忠实继承者波德戈尔内却无所顾忌地亲往“朝圣”了。可见苏修新领导集团干的坏事，比赫鲁晓夫有过之而无不及。他们在反革命道路上，比自己的前辈赫鲁晓夫走得更远了。
    毛主席一再教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”苏修领导集团与苏联人民和世界革命人民的敌人亲热地勾搭在一起，在国内必然要与苏联人民为敌，对外也必然要出卖世界革命人民的利益。我们要警告勃列日涅夫、柯西金、波德戈尔内这伙克里姆林宫的新沙皇们：叛徒是永远不会有好下场的，考茨基是这样，伯恩施坦是这样，赫鲁晓夫是这样，你们也终将逃脱不了苏联人民的审判，逃脱不了垮台的命运。
