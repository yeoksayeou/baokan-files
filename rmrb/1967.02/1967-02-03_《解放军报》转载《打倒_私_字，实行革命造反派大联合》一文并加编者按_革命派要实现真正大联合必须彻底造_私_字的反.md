The *People's Liberation Army Daily* republished the article "Overthrow the 'Private' Character and Implement a Great Alliance of Revolutionary Rebels" on February 1, adding an editorial note. The full text is as follows:

Editorial Note: Today, our newspaper republishes the article "Overthrow the 'Private' Character and Implement a Great Alliance of Revolutionary Rebels," which raises a question of universal significance and great importance: In the struggle for power, the proletarian revolutionary forces must thoroughly overthrow the "private" character to achieve genuine great unity, ensuring that the "public" character takes deep root in one's mind.

Currently, the revolutionary storm of the proletarian revolutionary forces seizing power is sweeping the nation, unstoppable. This great revolutionary storm is rapidly demolishing the strongholds occupied by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and at the same time, it is more broadly and deeply touching the souls of each individual.

Within the ranks of the revolutionary rebels, there also exist some non-proletarian erroneous thoughts that hinder the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces. These erroneous thoughts, ultimately, are all about the "private" character. This "private" character is a great enemy of the unity of the revolutionary forces. We must carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, overthrow the "private" character, and only then can we fulfill the extremely great historical mission shouldered by the proletarian revolutionary forces. As the article points out: "We are simultaneously carrying out two revolutions: the revolution to change the objective world and the revolution to change the subjective world. We are simultaneously carrying out two struggles for power: seizing power from the capitalist-roaders and seizing power from the 'private' character in our minds. Only by thoroughly seizing power from the 'private' character in our minds can we ensure the thorough victory of seizing power from the capitalist-roaders."

Seizing power from the "private" character in our minds means using the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly eliminate all selfish thoughts. Only by doing this can each of our comrades become a steadfast revolutionary fighter of the proletariat, standing firmly in the great winds and waves of class struggle.

    革命派要实现真正大联合必须彻底造“私”字的反
    本报讯　《解放军报》二月一日在转载本报一月三十一日第三版发表的《打倒“私”字，实行革命造反派大联合》一文时，加了编者按语，全文如下：
    编者按：今天，本报转载的《打倒“私”字，实行革命造反派大联合》一文，提出了一个带有普遍意义的、极其重要的问题：无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中，要实现真正的大联合，必须彻底造“私”字的反，让“公”字在头脑里牢牢地扎根。
    当前，无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的革命风暴，席卷全国，势不可挡。这个大革命的风暴，正在迅速摧毁被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所盘踞的顽固堡垒，同时，也更广泛更深刻地触及每个人的灵魂。
    在革命造反派的队伍中，也存在着妨碍无产阶级革命派大联合的一些非无产阶级的错误的思想。这些错误思想，归根到底就是一个“私”字。这个“私”字，是革命派团结的大敌。我们必须在灵魂深处闹革命，把“私”字打倒，才能完成无产阶级革命派肩负的极其伟大的历史使命。正如文章中指出的：“我们同时进行着两个革命：改造客观世界的革命和改造主观世界的革命。我们同时进行着两个夺权斗争：夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，夺自己头脑里‘私’字的权。只有在思想上彻底夺了‘私’字的权，才能保证夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的彻底胜利。”
    夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，就是用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，彻底清除一切私心杂念。我们每个同志，只有这样做，才能成为一个坚强的无产阶级的革命战士，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中站稳脚跟。
