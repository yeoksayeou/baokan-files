The revolutionary masses enthusiastically said: "Chairman Mao and we are heart to heart. At this critical moment of our life and death, he sent us his beloved people's liberation army, and liberated us once again."

According to the *Harbin War Report*: At the crucial moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses were seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, the good son of the people Liu Yingjun's former unit, in response to the great helmsman Chairman Mao's battle call, at the request of the Heilongjiang Provincial Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee, and with the close cooperation of the relevant departments of the Heilongjiang Military Region, swiftly destroyed the counter-revolutionary organization "United Headquarters" that had been entrenched in the Weihe Forestry District, repelled the new counter-attack of the class enemy's fake seizure of power, and strongly supported the local proletarian revolutionary masses in their struggle to seize power.

The Weihe Forestry District is located in the southern part of Heilongjiang Province. For a long time, the leadership has been in the hands of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They have been recruiting and colluding with traitors, forming cliques, and turning the Weihe Forestry District into an independent kingdom, a haven for hiding ghosts and snakes, and a stronghold for restoring capitalism.

The storm of the "January Revolution" shook the heavens and the earth. The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the Weihe Forestry District sensed that their end was near. They then gathered a group of ghosts and snakes, recruited a group of social dregs, raised the banner of "revolutionary rebellion," and under the sign of the "United Headquarters," staged a fake seizure of power on January 18. They controlled the instruments of dictatorship in their hands to brutally persecute and suppress the brave and unyielding proletarian revolutionary masses—the Red Rebel Corps and the revolutionary teachers and students from the Northeast Forestry College who came to connect. They created bloody incidents, and even ignored the warnings issued by the Heilongjiang Provincial Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee, plotting to massacre the proletarian revolutionary masses on February 8.

The soldiers of Liu Yingjun's former unit learned of this news and were filled with indignation. Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses inspired their fighting spirit. In the short preparation process, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle. Many comrades also solemnly swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: To support and assist the proletarian revolutionary masses in seizing power, we dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire!

Before dawn on February 8, before the class enemies could strike, the soldiers, fully armed, rushed to the Weihe Forestry District, took the ringleaders and behind-the-scenes commanders of the "United Headquarters" into custody, confiscated their weapons, and seized their power.

However, the reactionary forces in the Weihe Forestry District, in their desperation, made a last-ditch struggle, directly pointing their arrows at the People's Liberation Army. They spread rumors, saying things like "the PLA supported the wrong side" and "everyone will be labeled as counter-revolutionaries," deceiving some of the masses who were not clear about the truth. Later, they spread more rumors, saying things like "the PLA taking over is fine, but handing over power to the Red Rebel Corps is not acceptable," and "wait until the PLA leaves to settle accounts, then it will still be our world!" They attempted to stabilize their position and salvage the situation.

The broad soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our victory is not only due to the fighting of our army but also to the disintegration of the enemy's army." They, based on the policy of uniting all revolutionary factions, winning over the middle factions, and isolating the rightists, closely united with the local proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary teachers and students from the Northeast Forestry College, forming a propaganda army. They went deep into factories, forest farms, and family areas, fully exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the "United Headquarters" to the masses and propagating the Party's policies. Under the strong political offensive, the "United Headquarters" suffered consecutive defeats. The deceived masses woke up one after another, immediately tore off their armbands, threw away their weapons, surrendered to the truth, confessed to Chairman Mao, and exposed the die-hard elements. They expressed their determination to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand with the People's Liberation Army, and stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses.

The People's Liberation Army actively supported the proletarian revolutionary masses, greatly encouraging the red rebels in the Weihe Forestry District. They excitedly said: "Chairman Mao and we are heart to heart. At this critical moment of our life and death, he sent us his beloved people's liberation army, and liberated us once again." People, with tears in their eyes, shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

The Weihe Forestry District has been reborn, and the counter-revolutionary revisionists' fake seizure of power conspiracy has been thoroughly smashed. Today, the Weihe Forestry District is the world of the revolutionary people. People enthusiastically hail this as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! The victory of the power struggle in the Weihe Forestry District once again proves the great truth taught by our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

    粉碎黑龙江省苇河林区反革命假夺权阴谋
    刘英俊生前所在部队坚决支持革命派夺权斗争
    广大革命群众激动地说：“毛主席和我们心连心，在我们生死存亡的紧要关头，他老人家派来了亲人解放军，又一次解放了我们。”
    据《哈尔滨战报》报道：正当无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的关键时刻，人民的好儿子刘英俊生前所在部队，热烈响应伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召，受黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会的委托，在黑龙江省军区有关部门的密切配合下，一举摧毁盘踞在苇河林区的反革命组织——“联合总部”，打退了阶级敌人假夺权的新反扑，有力地支援了当地无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。
    苇河林区在黑龙江省南部。长期以来，领导权把持在一小撮反革命修正主义分子手里。他们招降纳叛，结党营私，把苇河林区搞成独立王国，成了窝藏牛鬼蛇神的庇护所，复辟资本主义的大本营。
    “一月革命”的风暴撼天动地，苇河林区一小撮反革命修正主义分子预感到它的末日即将来临，于是纠集了一批牛鬼蛇神，网罗了一批社会渣滓，打起“革命造反”的旗号，挂着“联合总部”的招牌，在一月十八日搞了假夺权。他们操纵控制在手的专政工具，对英勇不屈，奋起造反的无产阶级革命派——红色造反团和前来串连的东北林学院革命师生疯狂迫害，残酷镇压，制造流血事件，甚至不顾黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会发出的警告，竟然密谋在二月八日血洗无产阶级革命派。
    人民的好儿子刘英俊生前所在部队的指战员得知了这个消息，心头升起万丈怒火。毛主席发出的人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的战斗号召，鼓舞着他们的战斗意志。在极短的准备过程中，他们反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述。许多同志还在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：为了支持和援助无产阶级革命派夺权，我们刀山敢上！火海敢闯！
    二月八日拂晓前，阶级敌人还没有来得及下毒手，指战员们全副武装赶到了苇河林区，把“联合总部”的首恶分子和幕后指挥者统统看管起来，缴了他们的械，专了他们的政。
    但是，苇河林区的反动势力，狗急跳墙，作垂死挣扎，把矛头直接指向中国人民解放军。他们造谣惑众，胡说什么“解放军支持错了”，“要把大家都打成反革命”，欺骗了部分不明真相的群众。以后，又大肆散布流言蜚语，说什么“解放军接管可以，把权交给红色造反团不行”，“等解放军走了再算帐，那时还是我们的天下！”妄图稳住阵脚，挽救败局。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大指战员遵循毛主席的教导：“我们的胜利不但是依靠我军的作战，而且依靠敌军的瓦解。”他们根据联合一切革命派，争取中间派，分化孤立右派的政策，和当地无产阶级革命派及东北林学院革命师生紧密地团结起来，组成了宣传大军，深入到工厂、林场、家属区，向群众充分揭露“联合总部”的反革命罪行，宣传党的政策。在强大的政治攻势面前，“联合总部”的疯狂反扑接连遭到失败，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉醒，当场撕下袖标，丢下凶器，向真理投降，向毛主席请罪，检举揭发了贼心不死的顽固分子，表示一定要回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和人民解放军站在一起，和无产阶级革命派站在一起。
    人民解放军积极支持无产阶级革命派，给苇河林区的红色造反者以极大的鼓舞。他们激动地说：“毛主席和我们心连心，在我们生死存亡的紧要关头，他老人家派来了亲人解放军，又一次解放了我们。”人们含着热泪一千遍一万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    苇河林区新生了，一小撮反革命修正主义分子的假夺权阴谋被彻底粉碎了。今日苇河林区已是革命人民的天下。人们热烈欢呼这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！苇河林区夺权斗争的胜利，再一次证实了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们的一条伟大真理：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
