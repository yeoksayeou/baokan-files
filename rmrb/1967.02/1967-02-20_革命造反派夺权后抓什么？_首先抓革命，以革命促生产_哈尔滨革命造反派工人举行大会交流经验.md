The revolutionary rebels in Harbin's factories and enterprises held a meeting on February 13 to exchange experiences on how to focus on revolution, promote production, and save resources for revolution. The worker revolutionary rebels at the meeting introduced a large number of facts that showed they are not only pioneers in the revolution but also models in production.

Under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the production plan of the Heilongjiang New China Printing Factory was poorly executed. From January 1 to 12, only 8.2% of the monthly production plan was completed. After the worker revolutionary rebels seized power, they seriously implemented the policy of "focus on revolution, promote production." With their sky-high revolutionary spirit, they not only made up for the previous losses but also exceeded the monthly production target by 38% by the end of the month. The worker revolutionary rebels in the fourth workshop of the Harbin Bicycle Factory used their brains and hands to change the manual operation of the grinding circle machine in the key process to semi-automation, increasing production efficiency by 50%. After the worker revolutionary rebels in the Red Flag Furniture Factory seized power, they improved a sawing machine, more than doubling the production efficiency.

The experiences shared by the worker revolutionary rebels strongly demonstrated that after the revolutionary rebels seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, they must first focus on revolution and class struggle, use revolution to promote production, and achieve victories in both revolution and production. After the worker revolutionary rebels in the Heilongjiang Animal Medicine Factory seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, a small number of stubborn individuals who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line and the royalists found various excuses to go on strike for two days, creating difficulties for production. The worker revolutionary rebels saw through their plot, fought back against them, and at the same time, firmly guarded their posts and worked even harder to produce. As a result, these individuals' plot to sabotage production quickly and thoroughly failed.

At the meeting, the worker revolutionary rebels shared their experiences of working with revolutionary cadres to focus on revolution and promote production. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues, the worker revolutionary rebels in the eighth workshop of the Harbin Boiler Factory analyzed the performance of the acting secretary of the workshop party branch and the workshop director before and during the movement. They believed that although these two cadres had also carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, they did so unconsciously and had admitted their mistakes and decided to correct them, supporting the worker revolutionary rebels' struggle to seize power. Therefore, they should be trusted and supported. Thus, when organizing the production leadership team, they were invited to participate. After these two cadres joined the production leadership team, they often arrived at work early, actively arranged production, and played an active role in ensuring the completion of the product quantity and quality plan.

At this meeting, some worker revolutionary rebels from various factories also shared their experiences of saving resources for revolution.

The worker revolutionary rebels who attended the meeting unanimously adopted the "Initiative to Focus on Revolution, Promote Production, and Save Resources for Revolution."

    革命造反派夺权后抓什么？
    首先抓革命，以革命促生产
    哈尔滨革命造反派工人举行大会交流经验
    据新华社哈尔滨电　哈尔滨市工厂企业的红色造反者在二月十三日举行大会，交流抓革命、促生产和节约闹革命的经验。工人红色造反者在会上介绍的大量事实说明，革命造反派工人不仅是革命的闯将，也是生产中的模范。
    黑龙江新华印刷厂在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，生产计划完成得很不好。今年一月一日到十二日，只完成了月生产计划的百分之八点二。工人红色造反者夺权以后，认真执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，他们以冲天的革命干劲，不但把以前亏产的补上了，到月底还超额百分之三十八完成了全月生产任务。哈尔滨自行车厂四车间的工人红色造反者，动脑动手，使关键工序上的磨圈机由手工操作改为半自动化，提高生产效率百分之五十。红旗家具厂的工人红色造反者夺权以后，改进了一台锯床，提高生产效率两倍多。
    工人红色造反者提供的经验有力地说明，革命造反派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权以后，必须首先抓革命，抓阶级斗争，以革命促生产，才能取得革命、生产双胜利。黑龙江兽药厂的工人红色造反者夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙和保皇派，寻找种种借口，罢了两天工，给生产制造困难。工人红色造反者识破了他们的阴谋，向他们进行针锋相对的斗争，同时坚守岗位，更加努力地生产，结果，这些家伙破坏生产的阴谋很快就彻底失败了。
    在会上，工人红色造反者介绍了同革命领导干部相结合，抓革命，促生产的经验。哈尔滨锅炉厂八车间的工人红色造反者学习毛主席关于干部问题的语录以后，分析了车间代理党支部书记和车间主任在运动以前和运动中的表现，认为这两个干部虽然也执行过资产阶级反动路线，但是不自觉的，而且承认了错误，决心改正，支持工人红色造反者的夺权斗争。所以应该相信他们，拥护他们。于是，在组织生产领导班子的时候，就吸收他们参加了。这两个干部参加生产领导班子以后，经常提前上班，主动安排生产，在保证完成产品数量和质量计划中积极发挥了作用。
    在这次大会上，一些工厂的工人红色造反者还介绍了节约闹革命的经验。
    参加大会的工人红色造反者，最后一致通过了《抓革命，促生产，节约闹革命倡议书》。
