A comrade from Vietnam who is working near Hanoi recently wrote a poem enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is currently sweeping across our country with great fervor. The title of the poem is: "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

The poem reads:

	Uncle Mao said:
	“Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.”
	When the people’s communes were just established,
	The enemy launched vicious attacks against them.
	But,
	China’s thoroughbreds continued to gallop,
	The people’s communes continued to advance.
	China’s countryside became increasingly prosperous,
	The people’s communes became increasingly consolidated.
	The enemy became more and more frightened,
	Flies no longer dared to buzz around.

	Today,
	Uncle Mao has issued another call,
	The entire Party and the nation enthusiastically responded,
	And launched the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
	The enemy once again exhausted all means of slander and defamation,
	And launched another vicious attack.
	Let the monsters and demons bark all they want,
	We will continue to advance!

    中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    在河内近郊工作的一位越南同志，最近写了一首诗，热情赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导、正在我国轰轰烈烈地进行的无产阶级文化大革命。诗的题目是：《中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！》诗中写道：
    毛伯伯说：
    “被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”
    当人民公社刚刚成立的时候，
    敌人就对它进行了恶毒的攻击。
    但是，
    中国的骏马照样奔驰，
    人民公社照样前进。
    中国农村日益繁荣，
    人民公社日益巩固。
    敌人越来越害怕，
    苍蝇再也不敢乱叫了。
    今天，
    毛伯伯又发出号召，
    全党全国热烈响应，
    掀起了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    敌人又一次竭尽污蔑和诽谤之能事，
    再次进行恶毒的攻击。
    让牛鬼蛇神们狂吠去吧，
    我们照样继续前进！
