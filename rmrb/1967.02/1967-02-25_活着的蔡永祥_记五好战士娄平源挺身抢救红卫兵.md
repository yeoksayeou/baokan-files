On January 11th, a northwest wind howled, and the temperature dropped to minus seven degrees. In the Nanjing Army's certain unit's Third Company, Communist Youth League member and five-good soldier Luo Pingshun was, as usual, vigilantly guarding the No. 53 iron bridge.

At 11:03 AM, Luo Pingshun was answering questions from a group of Red Guards beside him when suddenly, a shrill whistle sounded behind him. He turned to see that the 2564 cargo train was speeding towards them. At that moment, two Red Guards were crossing the tracks, and because they were wearing hoods, they hadn't heard the whistle. The train was very close to them, putting them in danger. In an instant, Luo Pingshun thought of Cai Yongxiang's heroic image of saving Red Guards from a train: to die saving the young Red Guards is to die a noble death! Without hesitation, he leaped onto the tracks and with one swift motion, pushed the Red Guard on his right out of the way. The train was now upon them, and there was no time to push the second Red Guard. He kicked off the ground and leaped into the air, tackling the Red Guard on his left. The two of them tumbled to safety beside the tracks as the train roared past.

The two young revolutionaries were saved! The onlookers, including railway workers and Red Guards, were moved to tears by Luo Pingshun's brave actions. The two saved Red Guards took off their most cherished Chairman Mao badges and respectfully pinned them on Luo Pingshun's chest. A track worker, overcome with emotion, said, "I saw 'Cai Yongxiang' with my own eyes! You are the living Cai Yongxiang!" At that moment, the crowd raised their fists and shouted, "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Firmly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Luo Pingshun is a soldier who is loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he cared deeply for the revolutionary vanguard, the Red Guards. Whether it was day or night, whenever he knew that Red Guards were passing over the bridge, he would find ways to get them water if they were thirsty or food if they were hungry. One night, it snowed heavily, and the cooks made ginger tea for the soldiers. Luo Pingshun thought of the Red Guards marching in the cold and snow, who needed to keep warm to avoid catching a cold. He brought the hot ginger tea to the Red Guards passing over the bridge. He said, "The Red Guards are the little red soldiers of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. We should protect them and support them in overthrowing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party."

The heroic deed of Luo Pingshun saving the Red Guards quickly spread among the troops guarding the railway. The broad masses of soldiers and officers launched a campaign to learn from Luo Pingshun, vowing to be as loyal to Chairman Mao as Cai Yongxiang and Luo Pingshun, to defend Chairman Mao to the death, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, to fully support the revolutionary masses, to seize back the power held by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly over every corner of the motherland!

    “活着的蔡永祥”
    记五好战士娄平源挺身抢救红卫兵
    一月十一日，西北风狂吼，气温降到零下七度。南京部队某部三连共青团员、五好战士娄平源，象往常一样，警惕地守卫在五十三号铁桥上。
    十一时零三分，娄平源正在回答身旁一队红卫兵的问话，背后突然响起了刺耳的汽笛声。他转脸一看，二五六四次货车飞奔而来。这时，有两个红卫兵正在横跨铁轨，因为头上戴着连衣帽，没有听到汽笛声。火车离他们已经很近了。他们处在危险的境地。这一瞬间，娄平源脑子里闪过了蔡永祥抢救红卫兵列车的英雄形象：为抢救红卫兵小将而死，就死得其所！说时迟那时快，他一个箭步跃上轨道，一挥臂把右边一个红卫兵推出轨道。这时火车正冲过来，再推第二个已经来不及了，他便一蹬腿腾空而起，向左边那个红卫兵扑去，两个人一齐摔倒在轨道旁边。列车呼啸着从他们身边奔驰而过。
    两个革命小将脱险了！在场的铁路工人和红卫兵被娄平源的英勇行为感动得热泪盈眶。被救的两个红卫兵，摘下胸前最心爱的毛主席像章，恭恭敬敬地挂在娄平源的胸前。一个养路工人激动地说：“我亲眼看到了‘蔡永祥’，你就是活着的蔡永祥！”这时候，在场的群众振臂高呼：“向解放军学习！”“坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    娄平源是一个忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的好战士。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他对革命先锋红卫兵非常关心。不管白天黑夜，他知道路过铁桥的红卫兵渴了，就想办法给弄水；饿了，就想办法给弄饭。有一天晚上下大雪，炊事员烧了姜汤给战士们喝。娄平源想到在大雪夜里步行的红卫兵，最需要保暖防止感冒，便把热姜汤端给过桥的红卫兵喝。他说：“红卫兵是最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的红小兵，我们应该保卫他们，支持他们造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。”
    娄平源挺身抢救红卫兵的英雄事迹，在守护铁路的部队中迅速传开了。广大指战员开展了学习娄平源的活动，表示要象蔡永祥、娄平源那样无限忠于毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，全力支持无产阶级革命派，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所把持的权力夺回来，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍祖国的每一角落！
