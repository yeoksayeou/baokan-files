The Soviet revisionist authorities again instigated a large mob to storm our embassy and cause chaos. Our acting charge d'affaires lodged the strongest and most severe protest. Our embassy staff on the spot shouted in unison: "Down with modern revisionism!"

	MOSCOW, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) — The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, on the morning of the 8th, regarding the serious incident of the Soviet revisionist authorities instigating thugs to storm the Chinese Embassy on the 7th, lodged the strongest and most severe protest to the deputy director of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Ilyazavkin.

	An Zhi Yuan said, from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM on February 7, the Soviet revisionist leadership instigated four to five hundred special agents and thugs to repeatedly attack the Chinese Embassy. Your police did not stop this group of thugs at all, but instead directed them to break into our embassy's front courtyard to cause chaos. They violently struck the main entrance, side entrance, and front iron gate of our embassy building, smashed the glass windows of our embassy building, and posted anti-China slogans inside our embassy courtyard and on the gate. They also viciously attacked our people's most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. At 5:05 PM, more than twenty thugs even broke the lock of the second door of our main building and forcibly stormed into our embassy's office area. They screamed and shouted hysterically. Our embassy staff repeatedly warned and stopped them, but they continued to cause chaos for more than twenty minutes. After the Soviet revisionist leadership committed the fascist atrocities of smashing and stealing the newsstand set up within our embassy premises and brutally beating our diplomatic personnel, they created this new act of banditry. For this, I lodge the strongest and most severe protest to the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

	After hearing the protest from Acting Charge d'affaires An Zhi Yuan, Ilyazavkin made unreasonable denials, claiming that it was the Chinese Embassy that invited those people in and then pushed them out. This is utterly absurd. Acting Charge d'affaires An Zhi Yuan strongly refuted this baseless lie.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 7 — Under the instigation of the Soviet revisionist authorities, on the 7th at 15:00, another four to five hundred people claiming to be "worker representatives" with anti-China slogans came to the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union to cause trouble.

	These thugs claiming to be "worker representatives" in front of our embassy, viciously insulted our greatest leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. More than two hundred of these thugs even broke into our embassy's front courtyard, whistled, screamed, and acted wildly, and violently struck our embassy doors and windows with their fists. At 17:05, more than twenty thugs broke through the right side door of our embassy building and stormed into our embassy's office area, breaking the lock of the second door of the right side door of our embassy building.

	During the thugs' chaos, a small car was parked in front of our embassy on the road, which was the special car of the Soviet revisionist authorities' on-site commander.

	When the thugs were breaking in and shouting anti-China slogans and insulting Chairman Mao, our embassy staff shouted in unison: "Long live Leninism!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Down with the traitors of Leninism, the modern revisionists!" "Long live the Soviet people!"

    苏修当局又指使大批暴徒闯入我大使馆猖狂捣乱
    我临时代办提出最严重最强烈抗议
    我使馆同志当场齐声高呼：“打倒现代修正主义！”
    新华社莫斯科八日电  中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远，八日上午就苏修当局七日又指使暴徒冲入中国大使馆的严重事件，向苏联外交部远东司副司长伊利扎维金提出了最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    安致远说，二月七日下午三时到五时半，苏修领导集团指使四、五百名特务暴徒，数次袭击中国大使馆。你们的警察对这群暴徒毫不阻拦，而且指挥他们闯进我使馆前院大肆捣乱，他们猛击我使馆主楼正门、侧门和前院大铁门，砸碎了我使馆主楼的玻璃，还在我使馆院内、大门上，张贴反华标语，并恶毒攻击我国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。五时五分，二十多名暴徒竟然折断我主楼二道门的门锁，强行冲入我使馆办公重地，他们歇斯底里地狂喊乱叫。我使馆人员一再劝阻并提出警告，但他们还继续捣乱了二十多分钟。苏修领导集团在砸坏、抢走设置在我使馆范围内的新闻橱窗并野蛮毒打我外交人员的法西斯暴行之后，又制造了这一新的强盗暴行。为此，我向苏联外交部提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
  伊利扎维金在听了安致远临时代办的抗议后，进行无理抵赖，胡说什么是中国大使馆把那些人请进来，然后又把他们推出去的。这实在是荒唐之极。安致远临时代办对这种无稽的谎言给予了有力的驳斥。
    据新华社莫斯科七日电　在苏联修正主义当局指使下，七日十五时，又有四、五百个自称是“工人代表”的人，举着反华标语牌到中国驻苏联大使馆捣乱。
    这些自称是“工人代表”的暴徒们在我使馆门前，恶毒地辱骂我们最伟大的领袖毛主席和中国人民。暴徒中有二百多人，竟闯入我使馆前院，吹口哨，尖声怪叫，肆意胡闹，并用拳猛击我使馆门窗。十七点五分，有二十多个暴徒冲破我使馆主楼的右侧门，闯进了我使馆主楼办公重地。把我使馆主楼右侧门的二道门的门锁冲坏。
    在暴徒们的捣乱过程中，有一辆小轿车停在我使馆前马路上，这是苏修当局现场指挥者的专车。
    在暴徒们破门而入狂叫反华和辱骂毛主席的口号时，我使馆的同志们齐声高呼：“列宁主义万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“打倒列宁主义的叛徒现代修正主义者！”“苏联人民万岁！”
