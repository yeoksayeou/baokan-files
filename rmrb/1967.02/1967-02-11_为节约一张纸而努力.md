Chairman Mao teaches us: "In every place, we must cherish human and material resources, never waste them for the sake of immediate needs. In every place, we must, from the very beginning of our work, calculate for many years to come, for a protracted war, for the counterattack, and for the construction after the enemy is driven out. On the one hand, we must never waste resources, and on the other hand, we must strive to develop production."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our printing industry has undertaken a glorious and arduous task. Printing workers have diligently printed a large number of propaganda materials for the revolutionary rebels. However, in the previous period, due to the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's plotting and promoting economism, they recklessly squandered state resources, causing the printing industry to print many unnecessary and fundamentally unnecessary items. In some printing units, due to the capitalist roaders in power arbitrarily spending and signing off, the consumption of printing paper reached an astonishing level. Some units, due to the indiscriminate printing of leaflets, even used the paper intended for printing Chairman Mao's works and portraits to print propaganda materials. Such phenomena, we revolutionary rebels cannot stand idly by.

We deeply understand that Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts, and Chairman Mao's works are the most reliable guarantee of our revolutionary victory, the most powerful weapon to defeat any enemy. Being able to print more and better copies of Chairman Mao's works and portraits is our greatest honor and happiness. Currently, saving one more sheet of paper means contributing to the printing of more copies of Chairman Mao's works and portraits. Under this guiding thought, the revolutionary rebels of Dongfeng Printing Factory have been thinking of every possible way to save paper.

When various revolutionary organizations come to our factory to print posters and leaflets, we first carefully study the propaganda content and, based on the content, persuade them to reduce the printing quantity or help them save paper. Once, a revolutionary organization wanted to print ten sheets of double-page posters. We discussed with them and, without affecting the effect, reduced the double-page to four-page. Just this one time saved five sheets of paper. For example, when printing leaflets, we also reduced the original size by half, saving a lot of paper for the state. For some posters and leaflets that we thought could be printed less or even not printed at all, we repeatedly explained the reasons to the units coming to print, clarified the principle of "saving for revolution," and studied Chairman Mao's relevant quotations on frugal construction together with the revolutionary organizations' comrades who came to print. We made it clear to the printing units the great significance of saving paper, and they willingly accepted our suggestions, printing less or even not printing at all. This also saved a lot of state resources.

We do this because we feel that as true proletarian revolutionaries, we must never waste state property under any circumstances. Frugality and thrift are the essence of the proletariat; extravagance and waste are the characteristics of the bourgeoisie. We must adhere to the principle of saving, manage the enterprise well, and ensure that the enemy's every plot and scheme will never succeed.

    为节约一张纸而努力
    上海东风印刷厂“革命到底”战斗队
    毛主席教导我们：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。任何地方必须从开始工作的那一年起，就计算到将来的很多年，计算到长期坚持战争，计算到反攻，计算到赶走敌人之后的建设。一面决不滥用浪费，一面努力发展生产。”
    我们印刷业在无产阶级文化大革命中，承担了光荣而艰巨的任务，印刷工人辛勤地为革命造反派印刷了大批宣传品。但在前一段时期，由于上海市委耍阴谋，大搞经济主义，随意挥霍浪费国家资财，使印刷业印制了一些不必要和根本不应当印刷的东西。在某些印刷单位，由于走资本主义道路的当权派任意开支，随便签字，使得印刷纸张的支出量达到惊人的程度。有些单位因为滥印传单，不惜将印毛主席著作和印毛主席像的纸张都用去印刷宣传品。这种现象，我们革命造反派决不能坐视不理。
    我们深深地懂得，毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，毛主席著作是我们革命胜利的最可靠保证，是我们战胜任何敌人的最有力的武器。能更多更好地承印毛主席著作和毛主席像，是我们最大的光荣、最大的幸福。目前，多节约一张纸，就为多印刷毛主席著作和毛主席像贡献了力量。在这种思想的支配下，我们东风印刷厂的革命造反派就想尽办法节约用纸。
    当各个革命组织来我厂印刷海报和传单时，我们首先认真地研究宣传内容，根据内容劝导他们减少印刷数量或设法协助节约用纸。有一次一个革命组织要印十令对开纸张的海报，我们就和他们商量，在不影响效果的前提下将对开缩成四开。仅一次就节约了五令纸。又如在印传单时，我们也把原来规格缩小一半，为国家节约了不少纸张。有些海报和传单我们认为可以少印，甚至不印的，我们就一再和来印的单位说明理由，讲清“节约闹革命”的道理，并且同来印的革命组织的同志一起学习毛主席有关勤俭建国的语录，明确节约纸张的重大意义，使来印单位很乐意地接受了我们的建议，少印甚至不印。这也给国家节约了不少资财。
    我们所以这样做，是因为我们感到作一个真正的无产阶级革命战士，在任何条件下绝不应当浪费国家的财产。艰苦朴素，勤俭节约是无产阶级的本色；铺张浪费，任意挥霍是资产阶级的特性。我们一定要坚持节约原则，管好企业，使敌人的一切阴谋诡计永远不能得逞。
