The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest event in human history. As an observer, and also as a revolutionary living in China, due to my personal background, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has a special significance for me. I come from the largest imperialist, racist, and exploitative country in the world. I myself am not only a victim of American imperialism and racism but also a victim of modern revisionism. I have personally witnessed how a revolutionary country was changed, not by those who openly declare themselves to be capitalists, but by those who openly declare themselves to be Marxist-Leninists but are actually capitalists. We must always be vigilant and never allow those enemies who wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to manipulate the fate of the world revolution.

China is a great base for the world revolution. The Cultural Revolution, on the one hand, strikes at the enemies of the people of the world, and on the other hand, inspires the people in struggle. Anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese people is an enemy of the people of the whole world, and we must wage a struggle against them in every way. In order to defend the base of the world revolution, we must wage a struggle against the enemies of the people of the world. We revolutionaries living in China must, on the one hand, care about the struggles of the Chinese people, and on the other hand, never forget the oppressed and exploited people of our own country. We should study Chairman Mao's works carefully and seriously understand Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The oppressed peoples of the world regard the victories of the Chinese people as the greatest inspiration for themselves. Therefore, I believe that the Cultural Revolution is the greatest event in human history. I am happy to be able to witness this great event in human history. Mrs. Robert Williams

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has had a great impact on me. A few years ago, I began to study Chairman Mao's works, but at that time, I only studied them without experiencing them personally. After coming to China, I have gained a deeper understanding. I began to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide myself and make my thoughts revolutionary.

During the Cultural Revolution, I saw great democracy. Rebellion, not only to rebel against others, but also to rebel against oneself. Some people do not dare to make a revolution because they themselves are oppressors of the people. In foreign countries, some people talk about Marxism-Leninism with their mouths, and even hypocritically toast to the revolution, but it is all false, deceiving the people. These people do not make a revolution themselves and do not allow others to make a revolution.

In short, the greatest impact of the Cultural Revolution on me is that it makes me feel that I must make a revolution in the depths of my soul and rebel against myself; it makes me feel the power of Mao Zedong Thought. We should master Mao Zedong Thought well so that we can spread it to the people of our own country and enable them to fight better.

    人类历史上最伟大的事件
    美国  罗伯特·威廉
    中国文化大革命，是人类历史上最伟大的一个事件。作为一个观察者，也可以说作为住在中国的一个革命者，由于我个人的背景，中国文化大革命对我有特殊意义。我来自世界上最大的帝国主义、种族主义和剥削者的国家。我本人不仅是美帝国主义、种族主义的受害者，而且也是现代修正主义的受害者。我曾亲眼看到，一个革命的国家被改变了，不是被那些公开宣布自己是资本主义的人所改变的，而是被那些公开宣布自己是马列主义而在实际上是资本主义的人所改变的。我们要永远提高警惕，不要让那些披着马列主义外衣的敌人玩弄世界革命的命运。
    中国是世界革命的一个伟大根据地。文化大革命一方面打击了世界人民的敌人，另一方面鼓舞了斗争中的人民。凡是反对毛泽东思想和中国人民的，都是全世界人民的敌人，我们必须在各方面同他们展开斗争。我们为了维护世界革命的基地，必须同世界人民的敌人展开斗争。我们住在中国的革命者，一方面要关心中国国内人民的斗争，一方面千万不要忘记被压迫被剥削的本国人民。我们应该好好学习毛主席著作和认真地去理解毛泽东思想。
    毛主席教导我们，“枪杆子里面出政权。”全世界被压迫人民把中国人民的胜利看作是对自己最大的鼓舞。因此，我认为文化大革命是人类历史上最伟大的事件。我以在这里能够看到人类历史的这个伟大的事件而感到高兴。罗伯特·威廉夫人
    中国文化大革命对我有很大影响。我几年前就学毛主席著作了，那时，只学习，没有亲身感受。到中国后，有了进一步的体会。我开始用毛泽东思想来指导自己，使自己思想革命化。
    在文化大革命中，我看到了大民主。造反，不仅要造别人的反，而且要造自己的反。有些人不敢革命，因为自己就是压迫人民的。在外国，有些人口头上讲马列主义，甚至假惺惺地为革命而干杯，但都是假的，是欺骗人民的。这些人自己不革命，也不让别人革命。
    总之，文化大革命对我的最大影响，就是使我感到要在灵魂深处闹革命，造自己的反；感到了毛泽东思想的威力。我们应好好掌握毛泽东思想，才能传播给本国人民，使他们能更好地斗争。
