The revolutionary rebel workers of the Guangxi Ethnic Printing Factory have seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and have taken over the party, political, and financial powers. The morale is high, the fighting spirit is soaring, and the enthusiasm for production is unprecedented. The production situation has taken on a new look, and the glorious task of printing Chairman Mao's works and colored portrait has been successfully completed.

According to statistics, the average daily output of the lead printing workshop and the offset printing workshop after seizing power has increased by 68% and 2.27% respectively compared to the average daily output before seizing power. Among them, the daily output of the flatbed printing machine has created the highest record since the factory was established; the daily output of the rotary printing machine has also created the highest record in the past three months.

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party controlled the power of this factory. They used their positions to bully superiors and subordinates, play tricks, and play games. They oppressed and suppressed revolutionary workers in every possible way, which severely affected the workers' political enthusiasm and production. On January 23rd, the revolutionary rebel workers of this factory seized all the powers of the factory from the hands of the capitalist-roaders within the party. They abolished the old management organizations and management systems and dismissed the original leadership team. Revolutionary rebel production preparatory committees, revolutionary rebel production preparatory groups, and group production service personnel were established at the factory, workshop, and group levels. The new leadership team consists of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, all of whom are called service personnel and are responsible for managing various aspects of the factory's work. These service personnel not only manage production but also participate in production labor, and the relationship between people has undergone a new change.

After the revolutionary rebel workers took power, they responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm. They took many revolutionary measures to shoulder both the burdens of revolution and production, making the Cultural Revolution flourish. The task of printing Chairman Mao's colored portrait, "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" (Type B), and binding "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been successfully completed. An old worker said well, "In the past, the people in power did not treat us old workers as human beings. When we raised suggestions, they not only did not listen, but even secretly kept a black record against us, making us workers tremble with fear. Now that we workers are in power, we are the masters of the house, our mood is relaxed, and we can voluntarily compete to do the work." In the face of both intense movement and production, workers never complain. Some workers who participate in the meetings of the revolutionary rebel production preparatory committee automatically go to work when others go. Recently, the task of binding Chairman Mao's works is very heavy, and the amount of propaganda materials printed by the revolutionary rebels has increased significantly. The workers in the workshop have put forward a clear call: bind Chairman Mao's works during the day and do voluntary labor to bind propaganda materials at night, making both tasks well completed.

At present, the revolutionary rebel workers of the Guangxi Ethnic Printing Factory are actively studying Chairman Mao's works, continuing to implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, consolidating the power they have seized, and launching a greater production upsurge. They will achieve more outstanding results in both revolution and production to report to our great leader Chairman Mao.

    广西民族印刷厂革命造反派职工夺权后斗志昂扬生产面貌一新
    出色完成印刷毛主席著作毛主席像的光荣任务
    老工人说，现在我们当了家作了主，心情舒畅，自觉自愿抢活干
    新华社南宁电　广西民族印刷厂革命造反派职工从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手中夺回了党权、政权和财权之后，群情振奋，斗志昂扬，生产热情空前高涨，生产面貌焕然一新，出色地完成了印刷毛主席著作和毛主席彩色画像的光荣任务。
    据统计，这个厂铅印车间和胶印车间夺权后的平均日产量，比夺权前的平均日产量分别增长百分之六十八和百分之二点二七；其中平台机的印刷日产量创造了建厂以来的最高纪录；轮转机的印刷日产量也创造了近三个月来的最高纪录。
    过去，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掌握着这个厂的大权，他们利用职权欺上压下，耍阴谋，玩花招，对革命工人百般刁难和压制，工人们的政治积极性受到打击，生产受到严重影响。一月二十三日，这个厂的革命造反派职工从党内走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回了厂里的一切大权，废除了旧的管理机构和管理制度，取消了原来的领导班子，由革命造反派组成了厂部、车间、小组的革命生产筹委会、革命生产筹备小组和小组生产服务员等领导班子。新的领导班子里的革命工人和革命干部一律称为服务员，分工管理厂里的各项工作。这些服务员既管理生产，又参加生产劳动，人与人之间的关系起了新的变化。
    革命造反派职工掌握大权之后，就以无比高涨的革命热情，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，采取许多革命措施，把革命和生产两副担子都挑起来，使文化大革命运动蓬蓬勃勃地发展，印刷毛主席彩色像、《毛泽东著作选读》（乙种本）及装订《毛泽东选集》的光荣任务都出色地完成了。一个老工人说得好，他说：“过去当权派不把我们老工人当人看待，提了意见不但不理睬，甚至还暗中记你一笔黑帐，搞得我们工人心惊肉跳，现在我们工人掌权了，当了家作了主，心情舒畅，就能自觉自愿地抢活干。”在运动、生产都很紧张的情况下，工人们从不叫苦叫累。有的工人参加革命生产筹委会召开的一些会议去了，其他工人便自动上去顶班。最近，毛主席著作的装订任务十分繁重，革命造反派宣传印刷品的装订量又大量地增加，车间的革命造反派工人就响亮地提出：白天装订毛主席著作，晚上义务劳动，装订宣传品，使两项任务都完成得很好。
    目前，广西民族印刷厂革命造反派职工正积极学习毛主席著作，继续贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，巩固已经夺得的权力，同时掀起更大的生产新高潮，在革命和生产两方面拿出更出色的成绩向我们伟大的领袖毛主席报喜。
