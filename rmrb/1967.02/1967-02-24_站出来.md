In Heilongjiang, in Shanxi, in Qingdao..., revolutionary leading cadres in party and government organs have stood up. They have firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, on the side of the revolutionary rebels, united with the masses, and fought together to seize back the power over party, government, finance, and culture from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. This action is excellent! We revolutionary rebels support it a thousand times, endorse it ten thousand times!

Stand up, this requires a firm proletarian stance. Are you a revolutionary leading cadre? Then you must necessarily support the power seizure actions of the revolutionary rebels, actively rely on the masses, and "unite the three in one to seize power together."

Stand up, this requires the magnanimity of a proletarian revolutionary who insists on truth and corrects errors, and not be hesitant or timid just because the masses criticized you in the previous stage.

Stand up, you must dare to fight resolutely against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, discard all personal desires, and not fear being labeled as "ambitious" or "pulling strings from behind the scenes."

Stand up, the most fundamental thing is to uphold the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good cadre of Chairman Mao, and firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, "go to the masses, stay with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better."

For revolutionary leading cadres, past arduous struggles are a test; the more than half-year-long Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a test; at the decisive moment of the struggle between the revolutionary masses and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, what lies ahead is an even more severe test. Every cadre must undergo examination in this struggle.

Revolutionary leading cadres stand up, unite and fight together with the revolutionary masses, and strive for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    站出来
    北京床单厂红色造反者
    在黑龙江，在山西，在青岛……，党政机关中的革命领导干部，站出来了。他们坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的革命路线一边，站在革命造反派一边，和群众相结合，共同战斗，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中，夺回了党、政、财、文的大权。这个行动好得很！我们革命造反者一千个支持，一万个拥护！
    站出来，这要有坚定的无产阶级立场。你是革命的领导干部吗？你就必然支持革命造反派的夺权行动，积极依靠群众，“三位一体，联合夺权”。
    站出来，这要有坚持真理、修正错误的无产阶级革命者的大度，不能因为前一阶段群众批评过自己，就患得患失，畏缩不前。
    站出来，就要敢于和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作坚决的斗争，要丢掉一切私心杂念，不怕被戴上“野心家”、“幕后操纵”的大帽子。
    站出来，最根本的就是要用毛泽东思想挂帅，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好干部，坚决站在革命造反派一边，“到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    对于革命领导干部来说，过去的艰苦斗争是考验；半年多来的无产阶级文化大革命是考验；在无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的决战时刻，面临的更是一场新的严峻的考验。每个干部都要在这场斗争中经受检验。
    革命的领导干部站出来，和革命群众团结战斗在一起，争取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
