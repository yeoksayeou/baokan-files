The revolutionary faction of Taiyuan Rubber Factory, after seizing power from the handful of capitalists within the party, has seen a new face in production. The revolutionary workers have broken through foreign frameworks and rigid doctrines, smashed old rules and regulations, and displayed revolutionary pioneering spirit. In just two days, they solved the problem of modifying the "hot water circulation" equipment, which had not been resolved in the past two years. This has significantly improved product quality and greatly reduced production costs.

New China News Agency, Taiyuan, February 18th — After the proletarian revolutionary faction of Taiyuan Rubber Factory seized all power from the handful of capitalists within the party, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "promote a spirit of bravery in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production." They broke through foreign frameworks and rigid doctrines, smashed old rules and regulations, and displayed revolutionary pioneering spirit. In just two days, they solved the problem of modifying the "hot water circulation" equipment, which had not been resolved in the past two years. This has significantly improved product quality and greatly reduced production costs.

Originally, Taiyuan Rubber Factory produced tire casings using outdated "hot water pseudo-circulation" equipment. The quantity and quality of the products were unstable, and the production costs were high. Workers had proposed replacing this with a "hot water circulation" system, and the state had approved the investment in 1965. However, the handful of capitalists within the party merely patched together a set of old, unusable equipment from various sources. Workers watched as state resources lay idle, unable to be utilized. They repeatedly requested to modify the equipment themselves. This revolutionary demand was met with unreasonable reprimands and rejection from these reactionaries. They said, "This is a standardized equipment designed by experts and approved by authorities, with scientific basis. How can you meddle with it?!" When workers started to work on the modifications, these bad elements became hysterical, labeling the workers as "blindly working," "destroying standardized equipment, which is a counter-revolutionary act." They forced the reform work to a halt. They acted arrogantly, using foreign frameworks and old systems to bind the workers' hands and feet, suppressing the workers' pioneering spirit. This made it impossible for the revolutionary faction to manage, work on, pioneer, or create anything in the factory. The old rules and regulations, old production relations severely damaged and constrained the development of productive forces.

The reason why those capitalists within the party could act so arrogantly and do as they pleased was fundamentally because they had seized all power in the factory.

Chairman Mao taught us: The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The revolutionary faction of Taiyuan Rubber Factory, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, deeply understood this truth. On January 17th, they seized power from the handful of capitalists within the party in one swift action, overthrowing the bourgeois dictatorship.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The people have limitless creative power. They can organize themselves, advance to every place and department where they can exert their strength, advance to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare for themselves." The victory of the power seizure greatly boosted the fighting spirit of the revolutionary workers, igniting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The revolutionary workers immediately proposed to the temporary production command department: "We are the masters of the state. If we don't say it, who will? If we don't do it, who will? We must make the 'hot water circulation' a reality!" With the full support of the new workers' revolutionary organization—the temporary production command department—the revolutionary workers and relevant technical personnel, together, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle, daring to win, and serving the people wholeheartedly. They immediately launched into the intense battle of modifying the "hot water circulation" equipment. The foremen of the fitting workshop, full of revolutionary passion, bravely fought, fearlessly endured fatigue, braved the cold, forgot sleep, worked day and night, checking every part of the equipment, breaking through foreign frameworks, daringly modifying and innovating, displaying limitless wisdom and creativity. The boiler crew and the tire casing workshop workers closely cooperated with the fitting workshop workers, jointly researching, immediately discovering problems, and immediately solving them. Thus, after 48 hours of arduous struggle, the "hot water circulation" equipment was successfully modified and put into production! This production practice shows: Using this "hot water circulation" equipment, the temperature difference has been reduced from the original 9 degrees Celsius to about 2 degrees Celsius. This not only significantly improved the internal quality of the products but also saved the state a large amount of salt, coal, and water. At least 12,000 yuan can be saved annually.

The modification of the "hot water circulation" equipment is not just a technical battle but also a political battle. This living fact most powerfully exposes the crimes of those bourgeois elements when they were in power, suppressing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, strangling the pioneering spirit of the worker masses, and obstructing and destroying the development of productive forces. It tells people: Workers can only guarantee the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line by being masters of their own fate and managing themselves. They can break through backward production relations, thoroughly liberate thought, liberate productive forces, and fundamentally implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production."

    太原橡胶厂革命派夺权后生产出现崭新面貌
    革命职工冲破洋框框死教条，砸烂陈规旧章，发挥革命首创精神，在两天内解决了过去两年没有解决的“热水循环”设备的改修问题
    新华社太原十八日电　太原橡胶厂无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺过一切大权后，遵循毛主席教导的“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，冲破洋框框死教条，砸烂陈规旧章，发挥革命首创精神，在短短两天之内，就解决了全厂两年之久没有解决的“热水循环”设备的改修问题，使产品质量显著提高，生产成本大大降低。
    太原橡胶厂原来生产胶轮外胎是采用“热水假循环”的陈旧设备，产品数量和质量指标很不稳定，生产成本很高。工人们曾提出改换一套“热水循环”设备，国家也在一九六五年批准投资。可是，厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派应付差事，从几处拼凑了一套废旧设备，根本不能使用。工人们眼睁睁地看着国家财富白白放在那里，不能发挥作用，几次向他们提出要自己动手重新改修。这种革命要求，却遭到这些反动家伙们的无理斥责和拒绝。他们说，这是专家设计、权威鉴定、有科学根据的定型设备，你们还能胡来乱改？！当工人动手干起来的时候，这些坏家伙们更加歇斯底里，把“你们是瞎干”，“破坏定型设备，是现行反革命”等大帽子，一股脑儿地扣压在这些敢于革新的工人头上，迫使改革工作停了下来。他们就这样横行霸道，用洋框框、旧制度束缚工人的手脚，扼杀工人群众的首创精神，使革命派对工厂的事情，不能去管，不能去干，不能去闯，不能去创。旧的规章制度，旧的生产关系，严重破坏和束缚了生产力的发展。
    过去那些走资本主义道路当权派之所以能如此横行霸道，为所欲为，最根本的原因是他们窃据了工厂的全部大权。
    毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。用毛泽东思想武装起来的太原橡胶厂革命派最理解这条真理。他们在一月十七日一举夺了厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，专了资产阶级的政。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”夺权斗争的胜利大大鼓舞了革命派工人的斗志，激发了群众的革命积极性。革命派的工人立即向临时生产指挥部提出：“我们是国家的主人，我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？我们一定要让‘热水循环’上马！”在新生的工人群众革命组织——临时生产指挥部的全力支持下，革命派工人和有关技术人员一起反复学习毛主席关于敢于斗争、敢于胜利和完全彻底为人民服务的教导，立即投入“热水循环”设备的改修试验的紧张战斗。钳工组的师傅们满怀革命激情，勇敢战斗，不怕疲劳，冒着风寒，废寝忘食，日夜不停，翻上翻下，通里通外，检修设备上每一个零件，打破洋框框，大胆进行改装和革新，发挥了无限的智慧和创造力。锅炉组和胶轮外胎车间的革命职工与钳工组的工人紧密协作，共同研究，随时发现问题，随时进行解决。就这样，经过四十八小时的艰苦奋战，“热水循环”设备终于改修成功并投入生产了！这一段的生产实践表明：使用这种“热水循环”设备，使温差由原来摄氏九度下降到摄氏二度左右，不仅大大提高了产品内在质量，而且还为国家节约大批食盐、煤炭和水，一年之内至少可以为国家节约投资一万二千元。
      “热水循环”设备的改修不仅是一场技术仗，而且是一场政治仗。这活生生的事实，最有力地揭穿了那些资产阶级坏家伙们当权时压制工人的革命积极性，扼杀工人群众的首创精神，阻碍和破坏生产力的发展的罪恶。它告诉人们：工人只有自己当家作主，自己管理自己，才能保证毛主席的革命路线的贯彻，冲垮落后的生产关系，彻底解放思想，解放生产力，从根本上实现毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。
