Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and smash counter-revolutionary economism. The proletarian revolutionary factions of Qingdao held a grand rally to take an oath.

The People's Liberation Army participated in the rally, inspiring the revolutionary rebels and striking fear into the hearts of class enemies. A certain unit of the garrison held an armed demonstration march to resolutely defend the power seized by the revolutionary rebels.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 31st, after a thorough power struggle, the power in Qingdao is once again in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The united revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary masses held a grand rally on the 29th with over 40,000 participants to "grasp revolution, promote production, and smash counter-revolutionary economism." The workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres who attended the rally enthusiastically hailed the unprecedented unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the city and welcomed the major revolutionary measures taken after seizing power. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," thoroughly smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly purged the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, vowing to achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production and construction.

On the 29th, Qingdao was in a state of excitement. The fully armed People's Liberation Army participated in the oath-taking rally. The firm support of the People's Liberation Army greatly inspired the revolutionary rebels and struck fear into the hearts of the class enemies.

At the meeting, a representative of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee read a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the second and third orders of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee.

At the beginning of the meeting, the revolutionary masses on the scene, filled with boundless love, belief, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, sang "The East is Red" and collectively recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary things, if you don't beat them, they won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor, if the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't run away by itself." "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

After the meeting began, Yang Baohua, a representative of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee, spoke. He pointed out: After a week of seizing power in Qingdao, a handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road and stubbornly insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line were not willing to accept their downfall and continued to play tricks, spreading economism and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. Now, Qingdao is our revolutionary rebel's domain, and the power is in our hands. We must firmly grasp the power! Grasp it well! Push the Cultural Revolution in Qingdao to a new stage.

The representative of the Dongfanghong Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Organization called on all revolutionary workers to shoulder the double burden of revolution and production to repay Chairman Mao's concern and trust for us.

Comrade Wang Xiaoyu spoke at the oath-taking rally. He said, Qingdao is now our revolutionary rebel's domain! He hoped that in the future, under the premise of a unified direction, with the spirit of putting unity first, compromising and consulting on minor issues, we would unite all possible forces to build Qingdao into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The responsible comrades of the garrison army and navy in Qingdao, Chen Jide and Yi Yaocai, also spoke. They expressed their firm support for the revolutionary actions of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee and their firm stand with the revolutionary rebels.

After the meeting, a grand demonstration march was held.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 31st, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Qingdao enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great battle call and spared no effort to defend the power seized by the proletarian revolutionary rebels.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until you are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." On January 22nd, after the revolutionary rebel organizations in Qingdao seized power, those bastards who had their power seized by the revolutionary rebels joined forces with the ghosts and snakes in society to launch a new counterattack against the Revolutionary Rebel Committee, attempting to seize back the power they had lost. They organized the siege of the Qingdao Daily, which published the announcements of the Revolutionary Rebel Committee, and threatened the Qingdao People's Radio Station not to broadcast the telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao, the open letter to the people of Qingdao, and the first order issued by the Revolutionary Rebel Committee, attempting to cut off the voice of the Revolutionary Rebel Committee. At this critical moment, a certain unit of the garrison in Qingdao firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels and resolutely supported the revolutionary actions and revolutionary announcements of the Revolutionary Rebel Committee. They dispatched troops to protect the Qingdao Daily, which was under siege. The class enemies were extremely crazy, and they even arrogantly "ordered" the troops to withdraw their protection of the Qingdao Daily and withdraw the military representative from the Qingdao People's Radio Station. They also ran to the streets, distributing counter-revolutionary leaflets and attacking revolutionary masses. To repel the new counterattack of the class enemies, on January 28th, a certain unit of the garrison in Qingdao held a magnificent armed demonstration march, widely propagandizing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line among the masses, and expressing their full support for the Revolutionary Rebel Committee's seizure of power.

    据新华社济南三十一日电　青岛市经过一场翻天覆地的夺权斗争，印把子重新掌握到无产阶级革命派手里之后，已经联合起来的各革命造反派组织和革命群众，二十九日隆重举行了有四万多人参加的“抓革命，促生产，粉碎反革命经济主义誓师大会”。到会的广大工、农、兵、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，热烈欢呼全市无产阶级革命造反派空前大联合，热烈欢迎夺权后所采取的这一重大革命措施，最坚决地贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，彻底肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，誓夺文化大革命和生产建设双胜利。
    二十九日青岛全市沸腾。全副武装的人民解放军参加了誓师大会。人民解放军的坚决支持，使革命造反派受到极大鼓舞，使阶级敌人胆战心惊。
    会上，青岛市革命造反委员会的代表，宣读了给最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电、青岛市革命造反委员会的《第二号通令》《第三号通令》。
    大会开始时，全场革命群众满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，高唱《东方红》，并集体朗读了毛主席语录：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    大会开始后，青岛市革命造反委员会代表杨宝华讲话，他指出：青岛市夺权一周后，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，并不甘心他们的垮台，继续耍阴谋，大搞经济主义，破坏文化大革命，现在，青岛市是我们革命造反派的天下，大权在我们手里，我们一定要把大权掌牢！掌好！把青岛市文化大革命推向一个新阶段。
    青岛东方红工人革命造反组织代表在讲话中号召所有革命工人，把革命和生产两副重担挑起来，以报答毛主席对我们的关怀和信任。
    王效禹同志在誓师大会上讲了话。他说，青岛市的天下，成了我们革命造反派的天下了！他希望今后在大方向一致的前提下，本着以团结为重，小事互相让步、互相协商的精神，去联合可以联合的力量，把青岛建设成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    驻青岛陆军和海军的负责人陈继德、易耀彩也讲了话。他们表示坚决支持青岛市革命造反委员会的革命行动，坚决站在革命造反派一边。
    会后，举行声势浩大的示威游行。
    据新华社济南三十一日电　解放军驻青岛某部队指战员，热烈响应毛主席的伟大战斗号召，全力保卫无产阶级革命造反派夺到的印把子。
    毛主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”一月二十二日，青岛市革命造反组织夺权以后，那些被革命造反派夺了权的混蛋们，联合社会上的牛鬼蛇神，向革命造反委员会发起了新反扑，妄图夺回他们失去的大权。他们组织围攻发表革命造反委员会文告的《青岛日报》，阻挠并威胁青岛市人民广播电台不得广播革命造反委员会发表的《给毛主席的致敬电》、《告青岛全市人民书》和《第一号通令》等文件，企图割断革命造反委员会的喉舌。在这紧急关头，驻青岛某部队坚定地站在革命造反派一边，坚决支持革命造反委员会的革命行动和革命文告，对遭到围攻的《青岛日报》派部队加以保护。阶级敌人疯狂已极，他们竟狂妄地“勒令”部队撤销对《青岛日报》的保护，撤出驻青岛市人民广播电台的军事代表。他们还跑上街头，散发反革命传单，围攻革命群众。为了打退阶级敌人的新反扑，一月二十八日，驻青岛某部队举行了威武雄壮的全副武装的游行示威，在群众中广泛宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，表示全力支持革命造反委员会夺权。
