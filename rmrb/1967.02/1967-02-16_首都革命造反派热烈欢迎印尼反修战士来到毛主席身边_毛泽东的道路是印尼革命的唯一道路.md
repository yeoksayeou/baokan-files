Hundreds of revolutionary rebels from the capital and Indonesian friends in Beijing today warmly welcomed the honorable anti-revisionist fighter, Indonesian Communist Party member, National Committee member of the Indonesian People's Youth League, and Indonesian student in the Soviet Union, Suar Suroso and his wife, who were unjustly expelled from the Soviet Union by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, to the stronghold against imperialism and revisionism—China, to the side of the reddest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people—Chairman Mao.

At 2 PM, Suar and his wife arrived by car at Beijing Station. At this time, the welcoming crowd waved the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted repeatedly: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Salute to the brave Indonesian anti-revisionist fighters!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia!" "Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Amidst the cheers, Suar stepped off the train. Agitrop, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Deputy Secretary-General of the Secretariat, and head of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee delegation, accompanied by Liu Ningyi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat, walked to the side of the train and warmly embraced Suar, expressing their sympathy.

After the welcome ceremony began, the entire audience read Chairman Mao's quotations: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly triumph, be it late or early." "Resolutely decide to do it, be not afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Amidst the warm applause, representatives of the capital's revolutionary rebels presented Suar and his wife with Chairman Mao badges, large red flowers, and "Anti-Revisionist Red Guards" armbands.

Representatives of the revolutionary rebels from the China-Africa-Asia Solidarity Committee and the All-China Students' Federation, representatives of the Red Guards from the capital, and representatives of Chinese students recently returned from Europe spoke at the meeting, expressing their warm welcome to the Indonesian anti-revisionist fighters.

They said, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, most resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the Indonesian people and the people of all countries. The final victory will certainly belong to the Indonesian people with a glorious revolutionary tradition.

Ibrahim Isa, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, spoke at the welcome meeting. He said, Suar coming to the country of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, makes us extremely happy. He said, we feel fortunate that the world's revolutionary people have the strongest weapon to defeat imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists, which is the highest, most complete, and most comprehensive revolutionary theory, Mao Zedong Thought.

He said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique stands on the side of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world; it is a counter-revolutionary clique, our mortal enemy. To overthrow imperialism and reactionaries, we must oppose and smash the Brezhnev-Kosygin modern revisionists and their running dogs.

Isa enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, revolution is not a crime, and rebellion is justified. All revolutionaries in the world will rise up in rebellion. In the face of the great Mao Zedong Thought, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are just a few flies hitting the wall, and their days are numbered.

Isa said, under the illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people have found the correct path, the revolutionary path, the great path of people's war, the Mao Zedong path.

Sharmaki, a representative of Indonesian students in Beijing, said in his speech that the crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique will never be forgiven by the Indonesian people, never.

Sharmaki said, the conflagration of rebellion ignited by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao will surely spread throughout the world and ultimately burn down imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

Suar spoke amidst warm applause. He denounced the Soviet revisionist ruling clique for betraying Marxism-Leninism, betraying the great Lenin and Stalin on proletarian internationalism, openly collaborating with the Indonesian reactionary regime, and suppressing the Indonesian revolutionary student movement in the Soviet Union.

He emphasized that the Indonesian Communist Party will uncompromisingly fight against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and unite with the revolutionary people and Marxist-Leninists of the world, closely unite with the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China who highhold the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Suar said, as long as we arm ourselves with the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian people will certainly be able to defeat the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique and achieve victory in the revolutionary struggle.

At the welcome meeting, people repeatedly shouted: "Workers of the world, unite! Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Long live the Indonesian Communist Party!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!"

    首都革命造反派热烈欢迎印尼反修战士来到毛主席身边
    毛泽东的道路是印尼革命的唯一道路
    苏修领导集团对印尼共产党人的迫害证明它是完全的反革命派
    据新华社十五日讯  首都数百名革命造反派和在北京的印度尼西亚朋友，今天热烈欢迎被苏修统治集团无理驱逐出境的光荣的反修战士——印度尼西亚共产党党员、印度尼西亚人民青年团全国委员会委员、印度尼西亚留苏学生苏阿尔·苏罗梭同志，来到反帝反修的坚强堡垒——中国，来到世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席身边。
    下午二时，苏阿尔同志和他的夫人乘车进入北京站。这时，欢迎的人们挥动红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“打倒美帝，打倒苏修！”“向英勇的印度尼西亚反修战士致敬！”“坚决支持印度尼西亚人民的革命斗争！”“中国印度尼西亚两国人民友谊万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    苏阿尔同志在一片欢呼声中走下火车。印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局委员、书记处副总书记、印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团团长阿吉托罗普同志，在中共中央委员、中共中央书记处书记刘宁一同志陪同下，走到列车旁，同苏阿尔同志亲切拥抱，表示慰问。
    欢迎会开始后，全场朗读毛主席语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    在热烈的掌声中，首都革命造反派代表给苏阿尔同志和他的夫人戴上毛主席像章、大红花和“反修红卫兵”袖章。
    中国亚非团结委员会和全国学联的革命造反派代表，首都的红卫兵代表，以及最近回国的我国留欧学生代表，先后在会上讲话，向印度尼西亚反修战士表示热烈欢迎。
    他们说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民最坚决地支持印度尼西亚人民和世界各国人民的革命斗争。最后胜利一定属于具有光荣革命传统的印度尼西亚人民。
    印度尼西亚亚非团结委员会秘书长易卜拉欣·伊萨在欢迎会上讲话。他说，苏阿尔同志来到世界革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东同志的国家，我们感到无比高兴。他说，我们感到幸福的是，世界革命人民有了打败帝国主义者，打败反动派和现代修正主义者最强大的武器，即最高、最完备、最全面的革命理论毛泽东思想。
    他说，毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团站在帝国主义和世界一切反动派方面，它是反革命派，是我们的死敌。要推翻帝国主义和反动派，就必须反对和粉碎勃列日涅夫、柯西金现代修正主义者及其走狗。
    伊萨热烈赞颂中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，革命无罪，造反有理，全世界革命者都将起来造反。在伟大的毛泽东思想面前，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，只不过是几只碰壁的苍蝇，他们的日子不长了。
    伊萨说，在伟大的毛泽东思想照耀下，印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民已经找到了正确的道路，革命的道路，伟大的人民战争的道路，毛泽东道路。
    在北京的印度尼西亚留学生代表沙尔玛基在讲话中说，苏修统治集团所犯下的罪行，印度尼西亚人民是不会饶恕的，永远不会饶恕的。
    沙尔玛基说，毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命所燃烧起来的造反烈火，必将在世界燃起，最后必将焚毁帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和一切反动派。
    苏阿尔同志在热烈掌声中讲话。他痛斥苏修统治集团背叛马克思列宁主义，背叛伟大的列宁和斯大林关于无产阶级国际主义的教导，公然同印度尼西亚反动政权实行合作，镇压在苏联的印度尼西亚革命学生运动。
    他强调说，印度尼西亚共产党坚决同以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行不妥协的斗争，同全世界革命人民和马克思列宁主义者团结起来，同高举马克思列宁主义大旗，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民和中国共产党紧密团结起来。
    苏阿尔同志表示，只要用当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己，印尼人民一定能够战胜苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领集团，取得革命斗争的胜利。
    在欢迎大会上，人们还一再高呼：“全世界无产者联合起来，打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“印度尼西亚共产党万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！”（附图片）
