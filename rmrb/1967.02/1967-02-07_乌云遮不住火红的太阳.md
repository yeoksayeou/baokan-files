The wind is howling, the sea is roaring,
The Chinese people are angrily denouncing,
The great traitor Soviet revisionists!

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, in order to cover up the truth of the "January 25" incident,
Has committed another evil deed:
Poisoning our diplomatic personnel,
Destroying our news display windows.

Old debts unpaid, new debts incurred;
Every drop of blood debt, we will remember.

A segment of Chairman Mao's quotations,
Makes you panic and lose your composure;
A few news photographs,
Makes you, like a cornered dog, jump at walls!

You fear the truth,
Like demons fear sunlight.
Your fascist atrocities,
Exposed your inner panic!

The 700 million Chinese people,
Form an iron wall.
The Soviet revisionist ruling clique dares to challenge,
It will be utterly annihilated!

We fear neither heaven nor earth,
What are a few flies and wolves to us?
The roar of a billion people,
Becomes a vast ocean;
Bury the Soviet revisionist clowns,
Completely!

Lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot,
This is the inevitable fate of anti-China elements!

A mantis cannot block the wheel of history,
Dark clouds cannot block the red sun!

The Soviet people are awakening,
The revolutionary flame is burning brighter and brighter.
In great Soviet Union,
In Lenin's hometown,
The storm of proletarian revolution,
Will definitely surge like a tidal wave!

The red flag of Leninism,
Will definitely fly high again!
Fly high!!
