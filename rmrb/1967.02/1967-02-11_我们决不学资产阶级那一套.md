We revolutionary peasants who rebel will listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In this serious class struggle, we will definitely save money to make revolution.

Before liberation, our fathers and brothers were treated like cattle and sheep by the evil landlords, slaughtered at will, with nothing to eat or wear. They were driven to ruin by the reactionaries, begging on the streets, wandering aimlessly, without even the right to eat, let alone political rights.

The martyrs exchanged their blood and lives for this socialist country. Now, we have seized power from the authorities who were taking the capitalist road. We are truly the masters of our own destiny. In the past, the authorities who took the capitalist road squandered and wasted state property. Now that we are in power, we must not forget the hardships of the past and we must not learn the bourgeois way.

We control the financial power and will not increase expenses recklessly. We solemnly declare: our revolution is not an economic battle, but a political one. No armbands? We buy them ourselves. No mimeograph machine? We borrow one from a nearby school. All thoughts and actions that seek to show off, flaunt wealth, and waste state property must be overthrown!

We poor and lower-middle peasants know best how to seize the revolution and promote production, and how to be thrifty and economical. We will make the Jia Ding County Peasant Revolutionary Rebel Command truly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to save money to make revolution. The staff of our command have no special treatment. When going out for meetings, they do not stay in hotels and do not receive subsidies. Our revolution is not for work points, nor for fame and profit, but to ensure that the country will never change color. Our command was originally set up on a floor, which would make us high above the people and detached from the masses. Therefore, we have moved three times. We are determined to roll with the masses, live with them, fight with them, and win with them. This is our vow!

We control the financial power and will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be thrifty and economical, and will not compromise on principles. We will resolutely fight against all unreasonable phenomena. We will also vigorously promote the spirit of "saving money to make revolution and protecting state property," ensure that collective property is not damaged, and resolutely expose the schemes of a small handful of people who use the methods of dividing, eating, and using up everything to sabotage production, sabotage the socialist economy, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我们决不学资产阶级那一套
    上海嘉定县农民革命造反司令部（筹备会）
    我们农民革命造反派最听毛主席的话，在这场严重的阶级斗争中一定节约闹革命。
      解放前，我们的父兄给万恶的地主当牛作马，任人宰割，吃不上穿不着；被反动派逼得家破人亡，出门讨饭，流浪街头，连吃饭的权利也没有，更谈不上政治权利。
    先烈用鲜血和生命换来了社会主义江山。现在我们又从走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺了权，真正当家作主了。过去，走资本主义道路的当权派挥霍浪费国家财物；现在，我们掌了权，决不能忘记过去的苦难，决不学资产阶级的那一套。
    我们掌握了财权，决不乱增加开支。我们庄严宣告：我们闹革命，打的不是经济仗，而是政治仗。没袖章，怎么办？我们自己买；没有油印机，怎么办？到附近的学校去借印。一切讲排场、摆阔气、浪费国家财产的思想和行动都要打倒！
    我们贫下中农最懂得如何抓革命促生产，最懂得勤俭节约。我们要把嘉定农民革命造反司令部办成真正贯彻毛主席指示的节约闹革命的司令部。我们司令部的工作人员没有什么特殊待遇，外出开会，不住旅馆，不要补助。我们革命不为工分，不为名利，为的是使国家永不变颜色。我们司令部原设在一个楼上，这样会使我们高高在上，脱离群众。为此，我们连续搬了三次家。我们决心和群众滚在一起，生活在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。这就是我们的誓言！
    我们掌握了财权，一定要按毛主席的指示办事，要勤俭节约，决不拿原则作交易，坚决和不合理的现象作无情的斗争。我们还要大力宣传“节约闹革命，保护国家财产”的精神，保证集体财产不受损失，并坚决揭露一小撮人用分光、吃光、用光的手段来破坏生产，破坏社会主义经济，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋。
