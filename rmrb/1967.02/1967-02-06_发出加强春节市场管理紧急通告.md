The Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Committee of the National Financial and Commercial System and other revolutionary rebel organizations have issued an urgent notice on strengthening market management during the Spring Festival.

The proletarian revolutionary forces must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite, and seize the power to manage the socialist market and defend the socialist economic front. They must strictly implement Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and launch a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeoisie on the market front. They must break with the old customs and habits of feudalism and capitalism that have persisted for thousands of years, establish new customs and habits of the proletariat, and uphold Mao Zedong Thought. They must celebrate the Spring Festival in a frugal manner and use the festival to advance the revolution. They must seriously carry out the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and ensure the supply of goods in urban and rural areas. They must resolutely fight against capitalist tendencies and spontaneous actions.

New China News Agency, February 5th: The Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Committee of the National Financial and Commercial System and other revolutionary rebel organizations have issued the "Urgent Notice on Strengthening Market Management During the Spring Festival in 1967." The full text is as follows:

Under the correct leadership of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved tremendous victories. The revolutionary situation is excellent and getting better. Currently, the Cultural Revolution is entering a new stage that is deeper and broader. The main characteristic of this new stage is that the proletarian revolutionary forces are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This struggle for power is a comprehensive offensive by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party over the past seventeen years of rampant attacks.

The excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution will undoubtedly greatly promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production nationwide. Last year, due to the broad revolutionary workers, peasants, and other revolutionary masses' resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," they achieved the greatest leap and harvest in industrial and agricultural production since liberation seventeen years ago. The entire national economy has developed tremendously. This is reflected in the socialist market of our country, where a new and prosperous scene of prosperity and strength is presented everywhere.

However, class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. A handful of agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party are taking advantage of the upcoming Spring Festival to play new tricks, continuing to engage in counter-revolutionary economism, buying off the masses, sabotaging production, and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution in an attempt to save their dying fate. In recent periods, due to the serious spread of economism, some bourgeois reactionaries and speculators have taken the opportunity to enter, using the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat to sabotage the socialist market, launch a counteroffensive, and engage in activities to restore capitalism. This is a serious political struggle, a serious class struggle. We, the proletarian revolutionary rebels, can we just stand by and watch?! No! Absolutely not!!! We must unite and "sweep away all harmful elements." The notice is as follows:

1. We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite the proletarian revolutionary forces, and launch a mass struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must seize the power to manage the socialist market and defend the socialist economic front and firmly grasp it in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary forces. "Who controls the rise and fall of the vast land?" We, we, we proletarians!

2. We must strictly implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We must resolutely implement the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on Opposing Economism," the "Urgent Notice" issued by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and thirty-two other revolutionary rebel organizations, and the "Urgent Telegram" issued by the financial and commercial system revolutionary rebels' meeting to oppose economism and thoroughly smash the new counteroffensive of the bourgeois reactionary line. We must launch a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeoisie on the market front.

3. Break the old and establish the new. We must launch a comprehensive offensive against the old customs and habits of feudalism and capitalism that have persisted for thousands of years. We must establish new customs and habits of the proletariat, uphold Mao Zedong Thought, celebrate the Spring Festival in a frugal manner, and use the festival to advance the revolution.

4. The revolutionary rebels in the commercial, supply and marketing, grain, foreign trade, financial, and banking sectors must shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. They must face the countryside and the five hundred million peasants. They must make up their minds, overcome all difficulties, and seriously carry out the procurement and processing of agricultural and sideline products. At the same time, they must timely, planned, and organized the supply and distribution of goods to ensure the necessary supply of goods in cities, villages, institutions, and industrial areas during the Spring Festival. They must prevent the occurrence of phenomena such as excessive accumulation or shortages of goods.

5. The revolutionary rebels in the public security and industrial and commercial administrative departments must strictly perform their duties under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They must closely connect with the masses, rely on the masses, unite the proletarian revolutionary forces, guard the socialist market, and jointly do a good job in managing the market during the Spring Festival in 1967. The revolutionary masses should consciously abide by and maintain market management order.

6. For major state-procured, state-sold, and allocated agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, tobacco, hemp, and sugar, management must be strictly carried out according to the regulations of the central government and various provinces. Private merchants are strictly prohibited from engaging in business. The production and sale of feudal superstition items are strictly prohibited. Institutions, organizations, schools, and enterprise canteens are strictly prohibited from rushing to production teams or markets to purchase goods. Violators will be confiscated without exception.

7. We must resolutely fight against capitalist tendencies and spontaneous actions in the market. We must severely crack down on speculative activities and resolutely eliminate unlicensed peddlers and those who abandon farming to engage in commerce. For those who persist in their ways and firmly oppose the people, we must firmly strike them politically and economically and punish them according to law.

8. We must resolutely repel the fierce counteroffensive of the class enemies. For bourgeois reactionaries and speculators who beat and abduct market management personnel; incite uninformed masses to cause trouble; unreasonably loot personnel files and materials from market management departments; and attack and sabotage market management departments, they should all be dealt with as criminals and as class revenge by counter-revolutionaries. For the ringleaders and serious offenders among them, we must implement the dictatorship of the proletariat and punish them severely.

9. All revolutionary rebel organizations must mobilize all propaganda machines to carry out extensive, in-depth, and mass propaganda activities. We must vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production"; the great historical significance of the proletarian revolutionary forces uniting and seizing power from the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road; and the great significance of breaking the old and establishing the new, and strengthening market management during the Spring Festival.

10. The above points should be implemented by the public security departments and various financial and commercial departments nationwide. Those who violate the above points should be immediately investigated and dealt with as saboteurs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Resolutely and thoroughly smash reactionary economism!

Grasp revolution, promote production!

Long live the great struggle of the proletarian revolutionary forces uniting and seizing power!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    全国财贸系统革命造反联络委员会等革命造反组织
    发出加强春节市场管理紧急通告
    无产阶级革命派必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗实行大联合，把管理社会主义市场，保卫社会主义经济阵地的大权夺过来；必须不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在市场战线上，向资产阶级发动全面总攻击；围绕春节大造封建主义、资本主义旧风俗、旧习惯的反，大立无产阶级新风俗、新习惯，大立毛泽东思想，节约过春节，节约闹革命；认真做好农副产品收购工作和城乡物资供应，切实做好春节市场管理工作，坚决同资本主义势力和自发倾向作斗争。
    新华社五日讯　全国财贸系统革命造反联络委员会等革命造反组织发出《关于加强一九六七年春节市场管理紧急通告》，全文如下：
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的正确指引下，取得了巨大胜利。革命形势好得很，越来越好。当前，文化大革命开始进入了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。这个新阶段的主要特点，就是无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里夺权。这场夺权斗争，是无产阶级对资产阶级及其在党内的代理人十七年来猖狂进攻的总攻击。
    文化大革命的大好形势，必然大大推动全国工农业生产的大跃进。去年，由于广大的革命工人、农民和其他革命群众，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在工农业生产上，取得了解放十七年来最大的跃进，最大的丰收。整个国民经济有了极大的发展。反映在我国社会主义市场上，处处呈现出一片繁荣富强的崭新景象。
    但是，阶级斗争是十分尖锐复杂的，党内一小撮资产阶级代理人利用即将来临的春节，又在玩弄新的诡计，继续搞反革命的经济主义，收买群众，破坏生产，破坏文化大革命，妄图挽救他们垂死的命运。最近一个时期，由于经济主义的严重泛滥，一些资产阶级反动分子、投机倒把分子便乘机而入，利用无产阶级专政下的大民主，破坏社会主义市场，反攻倒算，搞资本主义复辟活动。这是一场严重的政治斗争，是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们是无产阶级革命造反派，岂能等闲视之？！不能！绝对不能！！我们要联合起来，“扫除一切害人虫”。现特通告如下：
    一、必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，实行无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，展开一场群众性的夺权斗争。把管理社会主义市场，保卫社会主义经济阵地的大权夺过来，牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。“问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们，我们，我们无产阶级！
    二、必须不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。坚决贯彻执行《中共中央关于反对经济主义的通知》、上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命造反组织发出的《紧急通告》和财贸系统革命造反派反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑誓师大会发出的《紧急通电》。在市场战线上，向资产阶级发动全面的总攻击。
    三、大破大立。围绕春节大造几千年来封建主义、资本主义旧风俗、旧习惯的反。大立无产阶级新风俗、新习惯，大立毛泽东思想，节约过春节，节约闹革命。
    四、商业、供销、粮食、外贸、财政、银行等部门的革命造反派，要把革命、生产两副担子担起来。面向农村，面向五亿农民。下定决心，排除万难，认真做好农副产品的收购工作和加工工作。同时，应该及时地、有计划地组织、安排、调运货源，以保证城市、乡村、机关、工矿区春节期间必要的物资供应。杜绝发生物资过分积压或脱销等不良现象。
    五、公安部门、工商行政管理部门的革命造反派，必须严格履行无产阶级专政职责。密切联系群众，依靠群众，实行无产阶级革命造反派大联合，把住社会主义市场这一个关口，共同切实做好一九六七年春节的市场管理工作。革命群众应当自觉遵守和维护市场管理秩序。
    六、对粮、棉、油、烟、麻、糖等主要的国家统购、统销、派购农副产品，应当根据中央和各省的规定严格管理，严禁私商插手经营。严禁封建迷信品生产、出售。严禁机关、团体、学校、企业的伙食单位到生产队或集市上抢购物资。有违者，一律没收。
    七、坚决同市场上的资本主义势力和自发倾向作斗争。严厉打击投机倒把活动，坚决取缔无照商贩和弃农经商。对于那些屡教不改、坚决与人民为敌的投机倒把惯犯，必须从政治上、经济上坚决予以打击，依法惩办。
    八、坚决击退阶级敌人的猖狂反扑。凡资产阶级反动分子、投机倒把分子殴打绑架市场管理人员的；煽动不明真相群众闹事的；无理抢劫市场管理部门的人事档案、材料的；以及袭击破坏市场管理部门的，一律以犯罪论处，以反革命的阶级报复论处。对于其中的首要分子和情节严重的打手，必须对他们实行无产阶级专政，从严惩办。
    九、各革命造反组织必须开动一切宣传机器，开展广泛的、深入的、群众性的宣传活动。大张旗鼓宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线；宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召；宣传无产阶级革命造反派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的伟大历史意义；宣传破旧立新、加强春节市场管理的重大意义。
    十、上述各条，希望各地公安部门、财贸各部门执行。凡有违反上述各条者，应该立即以破坏无产阶级文化大革命查处。
    坚决彻底粉碎反动的经济主义！
    抓革命，促生产！
    无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权斗争胜利万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
