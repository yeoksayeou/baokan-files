We, the members of the Shanghai Kongjiang Middle School Mao Zedong Thought Revolutionary Rebel Committee's Student-Worker Soldier Team, have followed Chairman Mao's directive to integrate intellectuals with workers and peasants, leaving our school to go to the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory to "grasp revolution and promote production." This revolutionary action has made those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road tremble with fear. At first, they tried every means to obstruct us, even refusing to provide the most basic protective gear—gloves. At that time, we thought: We came to the factory to make revolution and to learn from the workers. We do not care about our treatment; a little material hardship will not deter us!

Those scoundrels, seeing that their tactics were ineffective, resorted to even more vicious methods. They spread rumors outside, saying things like: "Working in the factory for a day earns six jiao," and so on. They attempted to use economic incentives to corrupt our resolve, divert the direction of the struggle, and lead the worker-student movement astray. We promptly saw through this trick and smashed another new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Frugality is the hallmark of the working class, a precious legacy. We must learn from the workers and resist any bourgeois infiltration, maintaining a frugal and revolutionary spirit. The workers have a proud saying: "If the revolution fails, we go to jail; if the revolution succeeds, we happily go back to hammering nails." They fight the revolution without seeking fame or wealth, fearing neither hardship nor death. The working class is our model. Recently, the situation in the factory has improved significantly, with power returning to the revolutionary rebels, and our working conditions have also improved. But we immediately sounded the alarm for ourselves: The Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism. We must not pursue material conditions and must uproot the roots of revisionism from our thoughts.

Now, all of Shanghai and the entire country are fighting against revisionist economism, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Every revolutionary rebel must be at the forefront of this struggle. In the past, we were "unyielding" tough bones; now we must also be "unseduced by wealth" tough bones. Only then can we stand unshakable.

    识破鬼把戏　及时敲警钟
    上海市控江中学毛泽东思想革命造反委员会驻上海玻璃机械厂学工兵团
    我们控江中学毛泽东思想革命造反委员会学工兵团全体战士，遵循毛主席的知识分子与工农相结合的指示，走出学校，来到上海玻璃机械厂，和工人一起“抓革命，促生产”。这一革命行动，使那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派胆战心惊，怕得要死。开始他们对我们百般刁难，连最最起码的劳动保护用品——手套也不发一副。当时我们想：我们进厂是来干革命的，是来向工人学习的，在待遇上，我们不计较，物质上的一点困难休想吓倒我们！
    那些家伙看看没有办法，又耍了一套更毒辣的手段。他们在外面拚命放空气说：到工厂劳动一天有六角钱，等等。企图以经济为诱饵，腐蚀我们的斗志，转移斗争的大方向，把工学运动拉向歧途。我们及时识破了这一鬼把戏，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的又一新反扑。
    艰苦朴素是劳动人民的本色，是传家宝。我们就是要向工人学习，抵制资产阶级对我们的任何侵蚀，艰苦朴素干革命。工人有句豪言壮语说：“革命失败了坐牢，革命胜利了高高兴兴地回去捏榔头。”他们干革命就是不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死。工人阶级是我们学习的榜样。最近，厂里形势大好，权力归了革命造反派，我们的工作条件也随着好起来了。但我们立即给自己敲了警钟：搞文化大革命是为了彻底挖掉修正主义根子，我们千万不能追求物质条件，要从思想上挖掉产生修正主义的根子。
    现在，全上海，全国正在反对修正主义的经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。我们每一个革命造反战士要在这场斗争中打先锋。我们过去是“威武不能屈”的硬骨头，现在也要做“富贵不能淫”的硬骨头。这样，才能使我们永远立于不败之地。
