Chairman Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

We must defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the Chinese revolution from victory to victory but also points the way for the Japanese people's revolution and the revolution of the people of the world.

Whether or not one acknowledges that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, the touchstone for distinguishing true Marxist-Leninists from false ones. The lies of the so-called "independent and autonomous" revisionists are increasingly exposed before all revolutionaries and will ultimately be completely bankrupt.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has opened a new era for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. It heralds the magnificent future of the world revolution. During my recent visit to China, I deeply felt that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is filled with the great ambition to thoroughly carry out the world revolution; deeply felt that seven hundred million Chinese people are universally receiving a great education in Mao Zedong Thought; deeply felt the great ambition and immense power of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought; deeply felt the boundless enthusiasm of the Chinese revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought for the world revolution; deeply felt the boundless faith, boundless respect, and boundless love of seven hundred million Chinese people for the great leader Chairman Mao; deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest directive for all work and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The great democracy practiced during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China fully trusts the masses, relies on the masses, and starts from the interests of the people. Seven hundred million Chinese people truly become the masters of the country, fully embodying Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."

During my visit to China, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique was frantically anti-China, openly and viciously attacking Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary pioneers who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are doing a great job in their struggle against the Soviet revisionists. They have completely and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "opposing imperialism means opposing revisionism."

Our task is to fully accept the great Mao Zedong Thought, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and concretely apply it to the practical struggle of the Japanese people's revolution.

    最彻底的革命
    日本　大塚有章
    毛泽东主席是当代的列宁，是全世界革命人民的伟大导师。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大的思想武器。
    我们必须保卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想不仅指导着中国革命从胜利走向胜利，而且为日本人民革命和为世界人民革命指出了方向。
    承认或不承认毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，这是革命与反革命的分水岭，是真假马克思列宁主义者的试金石。那些主张所谓“独立自主”的修正主义者的谎言，日益暴露在一切革命者面前，最后必将彻底破产。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，开创了巩固无产阶级专政的新纪元。它预示着世界革命的雄伟的前程。我最近一次访问中国，深刻体会到，史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，充满着彻底进行世界革命的伟大气魄；深刻体会到，七亿中国人民正在普遍地接受一次伟大的毛泽东思想教育；深刻体会到光辉的毛泽东思想的伟大气魄和无比威力；深刻体会到用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国革命人民对世界革命的无限热情；深刻体会到七亿中国人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限信仰、无限崇敬、无限热爱；深刻体会到毛泽东思想是一切工作的最高指示以及毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命运动中实行的大民主，充分相信群众，依靠群众，一切从人民的利益出发，七亿中国人民真正当家作主，完全体现了毛主席教导的“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”的伟大思想。
    我访问中国期间，正当苏修统治集团疯狂反华，公开地恶毒攻击毛泽东思想。在中国无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命闯将，对苏修的斗争好得很。他们是完全、坚决地贯彻了毛主席的反帝必须反修的光辉思想的。
    我们的任务是必须全面地接受伟大的毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想真正地学到手，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，具体地运用到日本人民革命的斗争实践中去。
