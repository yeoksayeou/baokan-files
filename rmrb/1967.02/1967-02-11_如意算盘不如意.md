Title: The Abacus of Wishful Thinking Does Not Work
Author: He Zhuo
Date: 1967-02-11
Edition: 6

The revolutionary flames soar to the sky, burning fiercely in the countryside. Revolutionary people rejoice together, while the monsters and demons are in a panic. They want to escape but cannot, they want to hide but cannot. In their desperation, they jump over the wall to counterattack, their hearts poisonous and their hands ruthless, playing tricks! They stir up evil winds, they raise black flags. No matter how they change, they stick to their old ways—the same old counter-revolutionary economism! They distribute less at the end of the year, keeping more for themselves. They sell off livestock, seeds, and farming tools. With one hand, they create land disputes; with the other, they focus on benefits and welfare... They use every trick in the book, attempting to achieve an evil goal: to undermine the foundations of socialism and destroy the collective economy of the people's commune! You, you, you, you evil thing, you bare your fangs and claws to bully people. But who would have known that the sugar-coated bullets are useless, the abacus of wishful thinking does not work! The revolutionary rebels have eyes that see through everything. Mao Zedong Thought is their weapon, they see through your schemes and tricks! They catch you, they overthrow you, the revolutionary people will not let you off! They will uproot capitalism and carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    如意算盘不如意
    贺卓革命烈火冲天起，熊熊烧到农村里，革命人民齐欢笑，牛鬼蛇神着了急。要想逃，逃不掉，要想躲，躲不及，狗急跳墙来反扑，心毒手辣又搞鬼把戏！他们把妖风刮起，他们打出了黑旗，万变不离其宗，还是那套反革命的经济主义！来一个年终分配少留多分，来一个变卖牲畜、种子、农具，一手制造土地纠纷，一手大搞待遇福利。……使出浑身解数，妄图达到一个罪恶目的：挖社会主义的墙脚，破坏人民公社集体经济！你，你，你，你这个坏东西，张牙舞爪把人欺，又谁知糖衣炮弹不中用，如意算盘不如意！革命造反派，眼睛亮无比，毛泽东思想是武器，识破了你的阴谋诡计！抓住你，斗垮你，革命人民不饶你！要把资本主义连根拔，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行
  到底！（附图片）
