Despite the efforts of the Bulgarian revisionists to deceive the people with anti-China rumors, the broad revolutionary masses of Bulgaria, undeterred by the danger of political persecution, have expressed their boundless love and respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in various ways. They enthusiastically hail the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

A common citizen, upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards over the radio, immediately called a Chinese comrade and enthusiastically exclaimed, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is excellent!" He also shouted, "Salute to Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Red Guards!"

An old revolutionary said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is of equal importance to the October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin."

An officer said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is driving the world revolution forward, and this is something that no one can stop."

A worker said that Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate the hearts of the Bulgarian people. He also said, "We Bulgarian workers raise our hands in support of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China."

    举起双手拥护文化大革命
    尽管保加利亚的修正主义者竭力想用反华谣言来欺骗人民，保加利亚广大革命群众不顾受政治迫害的危险，用各种方法表达他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限崇敬，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。
    一位普通公民从广播中听到了毛主席接见红卫兵的消息后，马上打电话给中国同志，热烈欢呼：“中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很！”他还高呼：“向毛泽东同志致敬！”“红卫兵万岁！”
    一位老革命者说：“毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命与列宁领导的十月社会主义革命具有同等重要的意义。”
    一位军官说：“毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在推动着世界革命向前发展，这是任何人也阻挡不了的。”
    一位工人说，毛泽东思想永远照耀着保加利亚人民的心。他还说，我们保加利亚工人举起双手赞成中国无产阶级文化大革命。
