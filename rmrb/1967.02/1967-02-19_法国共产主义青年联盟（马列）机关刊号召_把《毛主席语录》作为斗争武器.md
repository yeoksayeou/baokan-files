The French Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist) organ, the monthly publication "Red Guards," in its recently published third issue, carried an article praising "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The article emphasized that the ideas contained in this red book enrich and develop Marxism-Leninism.

The article went on to say, "The publication of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is a new event in history. It signifies that the revolutionary masses can directly grasp Marxism-Leninism. Once Marxism-Leninism is deeply rooted among the masses, it will become a material force."

The article stressed that this red book "creatively and comprehensively embodies the principle of the unity of theory and practice; from this point of view, it is also a development of Marxism-Leninism. At present, China is in a new era where the workers, peasants, and soldiers are grasping Marxism-Leninism and turning it into an invincible material force."

The article called on all Marxist-Leninists to use "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a weapon in the struggle.

    把《毛主席语录》作为斗争武器
    新华社巴黎十一日电　法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）机关刊物《红卫兵》月刊在最近出版的第三期上发表文章，热烈赞扬《毛主席语录》。文章强调指出，这本红书中所体现的毛泽东思想，丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    文章接着写道，《毛主席语录》的出版“是历史上一个崭新的事件。它标志着革命群众本身能够直接掌握马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义一经深入群众，就会变成一种物质力量”。
    文章强调说，这本红书“创造性地和全面地体现了理论与实践相结合的原则；从这个观点来看，它也是马克思列宁主义的一个发展。目前中国正是处在工农兵掌握马克思列宁主义的新时代，他们正在把马克思列宁主义变为不可战胜的物质力量”。
    文章号召一切马克思列宁主义者把《毛主席语录》作为斗争的武器。
