Jails Cannot Intimidate Bolivian Communists
Bolivian Communist Party Condemns Reactionary Regime's Arbitrary Arrest of Party Leaders; Chinese Political and Legal Society Strongly Protests Bolivian Government's Anti-Communist, Anti-People Crimes

New York, February 29th: La Paz News: The National Secretariat of the Bolivian Communist Party issued a statement on January 18th, condemning the arbitrary arrest of Bolivian Communist Party General Secretary Oscar Zamora by the Bolivian dictatorship on the 17th.

The statement said, "The Bolivian reactionary regime dispatched nearly thirty agents to arrest Bolivian Communist Party General Secretary Oscar Zamora on the 17th. This once again proves that in this country, which is ruled by a dictatorship disguised as a 'constitutional' government, the so-called 'civil liberties' do not exist. The sole purpose of the dictatorship is to hand over resources to the greedy American imperialists. When the people rise up to oppose its anti-national, anti-worker, pro-imperialist policies, it resorts to suppression."

The statement expressed that the Bolivian Communist Party will steadfastly defend the nation's resources, democracy, freedom, university autonomy, and all reasonable demands of the Bolivian people in the struggle against American imperialism and the capitulationist government.

The National News Committee of the Bolivian Communist Party revealed in a statement issued on the 18th that after arresting Oscar Zamora, the Bolivian reactionary regime savagely tortured him, causing him serious injuries.

According to reports, after arresting Oscar Zamora, the Bolivian reactionary regime also arrested other Communist Party members, leaders of other political parties, and union leaders. Oscar Zamora has been exiled to a place where a leper colony is located.

New York, February 1st: The Chinese Political and Legal Society issued a statement today, severely condemning and strongly protesting the recent arbitrary arrest of Bolivian Communist Party General Secretary Oscar Zamora and other leaders by the Bolivian dictatorship, as well as the severe torture and cruel persecution they have endured. The statement pointed out that this is another heinous anti-communist, anti-people crime committed by the Bolivian reactionary ruling clique.

The statement said, "The Bolivian Communist Party and the Bolivian people are waging an unyielding and heroic struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys in Bolivia, against modern revisionism centered around the leadership of the CPSU, and for national independence and liberation. They have the full support of the revolutionary people of the world. Chinese legal workers and the Chinese people resolutely support the Bolivian people in rising up to overthrow American imperialism and its lackeys in Bolivia and modern revisionism. 'Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified.' The revolutionary actions of Oscar Zamora and others are excellent! They are completely innocent, and the Bolivian reactionary regime must immediately release them."
