On February 1 at 3:30 PM, Chinese Ambassador to France Huang Zhen summoned the Director of the Political Department of the French Foreign Ministry, Debomarchais, to lodge a serious protest against the French police's suppression of Chinese students in France.

Ambassador Huang Zhen pointed out that the French police's suppression of Chinese students in France is a serious incident since the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations. This is entirely the responsibility of the French side, and the French government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this incident.

After condemning the French police's atrocities, Ambassador Huang Zhen emphasized: The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. Today's China is no longer the China of over a hundred years ago that was oppressed and enslaved by imperialism, nor is it the China under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek before 1949. Today's China is the new China led by the great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the 700 million Chinese people who have stood up are not to be trifled with.

Debomarchais tried to defend himself, claiming that "China is overreacting to the situation." Ambassador Huang Zhen sternly refuted his excuses, leaving Debomarchais speechless and at a loss for words.

Prior to this, the responsible official of the West Europe Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned the First Secretary of the French Embassy in China, Sarge, on January 31, to lodge a serious verbal protest against the French police's suppression of Chinese students in France.

    新华社二日讯　二月一日下午三时半，中国驻法国大使黄镇约见法国外交部政治司长德波马歇，就法国警察镇压我留法学生事件提出严重抗议。
    黄镇大使指出，法国警察镇压我留法学生的暴行，是中法建交以来的严重事件，这是法国方面一手造成的，法国政府应承担由此而引起的全部责任。
    黄镇大使在谴责法国警察暴行后，着重指出：中国人民是不可侮的，今天的中国不再是一百多年前受帝国主义压迫和奴役的中国，也不再是一九四九年以前蒋介石反动统治下的中国。今天的中国，是在中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和共产党领导下的新中国，站起来了的七亿中国人民是不好惹的。
    德波马歇竭力辩解，胡说什么“中国把事态看得过分严重”。黄镇大使严正批驳了对方狡辩，德波马歇理屈词穷，无言以对。
    在此以前，我外交部西欧司负责人在一月三十一日召见法国驻华使馆一等参赞塞尔格，就法国警察镇压我留法学生事件提出口头严重抗议。
