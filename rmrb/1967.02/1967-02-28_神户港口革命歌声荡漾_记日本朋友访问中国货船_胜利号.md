At 2 p.m. on January 29, the Chinese cargo ship "Victory" docked at Kobe Port resonated with powerful revolutionary songs:

	The vast ocean relies on the helmsman,
	All things grow with the sun,
	The rain and dew nourish the crops,
	Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought...

At this moment, a row of Chinese crew members stood on the deck of the "Victory," waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically welcoming the Japanese friends who had come to visit.

At the same time, more than forty Japanese friends organized by the Hyogo Prefecture Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) arrived on a speedboat, swiftly approaching the Chinese cargo ship. The friends on the speedboat also held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that shone with red light.

After the speedboat docked alongside the "Victory," the Japanese friends excitedly boarded the cargo ship's deck, and the ship was filled with joy. A young Japanese worker, upon entering the cabin, saw the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait hanging on the wall and couldn't help but shout, "Ah! I have come to Chairman Mao's side today!"

After the director of the Hyogo Prefecture Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Secretariat, Nakajima Masao, and the captain of the "Victory" spoke, a friendly gathering began, symbolizing the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

During the gathering, the Japanese friends turned on a tape recorder they had brought with them, playing the live performance of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe's visit to this place at the end of last year. Six young people from the Nishiwakiyama Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Branch sang Mao Zedong Thought songs in Japanese:

	"Our comrades, when faced with difficulties, must see achievements, see the light, and boost our morale." and "The vast ocean relies on the helmsman." They then performed the famous Japanese song "Give Back Okinawa." The captain and crew of the "Victory" loudly sang more than twenty Mao Zedong Thought songs. These songs spreading Mao Zedong Thought made people's hearts bright and filled them with strength. Japanese students studying Chinese at Kobe University of Foreign Studies sang songs like "We Walk on the Great Road" in Chinese.

Later, amidst boundless joy, Chinese and Japanese friends warmly discussed the fruits of studying Chairman Mao's works and the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China; they discussed the victories in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the two peoples. They encouraged and inspired each other, and their hearts were tightly bound together.

Two hours passed. As they bid farewell, Chinese and Japanese friends signed each other's copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a keepsake. A Japanese friend wrote in a Chinese friend's copy: "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship, long live Chairman Mao!" In the revolutionary song "The vast ocean relies on the helmsman," the Japanese friends, tears in their eyes, said goodbye to their Chinese friends. The speedboat left the "Victory." The red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" held high by the Chinese and Japanese friends seemed like countless beams of golden light, shining on and imprinting in the hearts of everyone. Song after song praising the great leader Chairman Mao echoed in the sky above Kobe Port.

    神户港口革命歌声荡漾
    ——记日本朋友访问中国货船“胜利号”
    一月二十九日下午两点钟，从停泊在神户港的中国货轮“胜利号”上，传出了一阵阵雄壮的革命歌声：
    大海航行靠舵手，
    万物生长靠太阳，
    雨露滋润禾苗壮，
    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想……
    这时候，“胜利号”的甲板上站着一排中国船员，他们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情地欢迎日本朋友的来访。
    兵库县日中友好协会（正统）本部组织的四十多位日本朋友也在这时乘着一艘快艇，迅速靠近中国的货轮。快艇上的朋友们也都拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。
    快艇靠紧“胜利号”后，日本朋友们兴奋地登上货轮的甲板，这时，船上一片欢腾。一位日本青年工人，一进船舱，看到迎面悬挂着的伟大领袖毛主席的像，就情不自禁地欢呼起来：“啊！我今天也来到了毛主席的身边！”
    在兵库县日中友好协会（正统）本部事务局长中岛正夫和“胜利号”船长讲话以后，一个体现中日两国人民友好的联欢会开始了。
    在联欢中，日本朋友打开了他们随身带来的录音机，播出了去年年底北京歌舞团访问这里时演出的实况。尼崎日中友好协会（正统）支部的六个青年兴奋地用日文唱起了毛主席语录歌：
    “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”和《大海航行靠舵手》。接着他们又演唱著名的日本歌曲《还我冲绳》。“胜利号”的船长和船员一连高声歌唱了二十几支毛主席语录歌。这些传播毛泽东思想的歌声，唱得人们心里亮堂堂，唱得人们浑身是力量。在神户外国语大学学习中文的日本学生，用中文高声演唱了《我们走在大路上》等歌曲。
    随后，浸沉在无限欢乐中的中日两国朋友亲切地交谈起学习毛主席著作的收获和中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义；交谈起两国人民反帝、反修斗争的胜利。他们互相鼓舞、互相勉励，他们的心紧紧地连在一起。
    两个小时过去了。临别时，中日两国朋友们互相在《毛主席语录》上签名留念。一位日本朋友在一位中国朋友的《毛主席语录》上写道：“日中友好万岁，毛主席万岁！”
    在《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌曲声中，日本朋友们激动地含着眼泪同中国朋友们道别了。快艇离开了“胜利号”。中日两国朋友们手中高举着的红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，好象万道金光，照在每一个人的身上，印在每一个人的心上。一曲又一曲歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌声，在神户港口的上空震荡着。
