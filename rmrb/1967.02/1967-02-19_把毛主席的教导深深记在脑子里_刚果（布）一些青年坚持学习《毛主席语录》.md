It was a Thursday evening. In a classroom of a primary school in the Podopodo district of Brazzaville, the capital of the People's Republic of the Congo, a Congolese youth was writing on the blackboard. Under the lamplight, several dozen youths were sitting, each deeply engrossed, carefully copying down the words on the blackboard. After finishing a passage, they eagerly wrote at the end of their copied segments: "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

This was a group of youths from the 15th branch of the National Revolutionary Movement of the Congo, who were copying and studying the quotations from our great leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. For a long time, they had been gathering here to study and discuss Chairman Mao's works. Over two months ago, they received this red book of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and everyone was so excited that they jumped up. However, there were few books and many people, so they decided to gather in this classroom every Thursday evening after work or school to copy and study "Quotations from Chairman Mao." By now, they had copied it eight or nine times. Each time, after copying a quotation, they would raise questions and discuss them.

Following Chairman Mao's Teachings in Action

When the reporter visited, they were copying a passage from Chairman Mao: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in various forms of sabotage and disruption every day and every hour, trying to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance." After copying, the chairman of the youth organization of this branch explained to everyone based on the fact that imperialists had repeatedly attempted to overthrow the Congo (Brazzaville) and the experience of the Congolese people's anti-overthrow struggle. He also called on everyone to continue to be highly vigilant against the enemy's sabotage and rumors, strengthen sentry duty, and night patrols. The youths participating in the study also expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously agreeing to maintain revolutionary vigilance as Chairman Mao instructed. They also proposed many suggestions on how to enhance vigilance.

These youth members included primary school teachers, students, and militiamen, as well as craftsmen and tailors. They studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" by closely linking it to the problems they encountered in their struggles, especially ideological issues. Therefore, after studying, their revolutionary consciousness significantly improved.

The chairman of this branch's youth organization told the reporter: "Since new members frequently join the revolutionary youth ranks, we specially selected another quotation from Chairman Mao to study: 'Revolution is not a dinner party, not an essay, not a painting or embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained, and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.' Now, Chairman Mao's famous words are deeply ingrained in the minds of every youth member."

We Have the Direction and Strength for Revolution

Some youth members of this branch, when talking about their gains from studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao," told the reporter the following examples: In response to imperialists and reactionaries often using rumors to deceive and divide them, they repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's important words: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." For example, in the struggle, youth members often encounter difficulties. Whenever they face difficulties and feel tired, they would read the instructions related to revolutionary heroism in "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Initially, there were twenty-five youths who voluntarily participated in the study, and now the number has increased to forty-five members. Some youth members, in addition to their own studies, are also responsible for organizing the various small groups affiliated with the branch to copy and study Chairman Mao's quotations.

These youths participating in the study excitedly told the reporter: "We love 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' because it is the beacon on our revolutionary path, giving us the direction and strength for revolution. 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' provides answers to all problems of the world revolution. We will study not only in theory but also practice as Chairman Mao teaches us."

### 把毛主席的教导深深记在脑子里  刚果（布）一些青年坚持学习《毛主席语录》

    把毛主席的教导深深记在脑子里
    刚果（布）一些青年坚持学习《毛主席语录》
    这是一个星期四的傍晚。在刚果（布）首都布拉柴维尔波多波多区一所小学的教室里，一位刚果（布）青年正在黑板上写字。灯光下坐着几十个青年，个个全神贯注，照着黑板上的字非常用心地抄写着。一段话抄完了，他们又在各自抄写的段落末尾兴奋地写下了这样几个大字：“毛主席语录”。
    这是刚果（布）全国革命运动第十五支部的一批青年正在抄写和学习我们伟大的领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的语录。长久以来，他们就经常在这里集会，学习和讨论毛主席的著作。两个多月以前，他们又获得了《毛主席语录》这本红彤彤的宝书，个个兴奋得跳了起来。但是书少人多，因此，他们便决定每个星期四的傍晚，在劳动或放学之后，大家到这个教室里集合，专门抄写和学习《毛主席语录》。到现在，他们已经抄写了八、九次。每次，抄完一条语录之后，大家就提出问题，进行讨论。
    照毛主席所说的那样去做
    记者访问时，正值他们在教室中抄写伟大领袖毛主席的这样一段话：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”抄写完了后，这个支部青年组织的主席还根据帝国主义屡次向刚果（布）进行阴谋颠覆的事实，和刚果（布）人民反颠覆斗争的经验，向大家作了讲解，并且呼吁大家要继续加倍警惕敌人的破坏和造谣，加强岗哨和夜间值勤。参加学习的青年们也纷纷发表意见，一致表示要象毛主席所指示的那样，永远保持革命警惕性。他们还提出了许多关于加强警惕性的建议。
    这些青年成员有的是小学教员、学生和民兵，有的是手艺工人和裁缝。他们学习《毛主席语录》时，密切结合他们在斗争中所遇到的思想等问题。因此，经过学习，革命觉悟显著提高。
    这个支部青年组织的主席对记者说：由于革命青年队伍内经常不断有新成员参加，还特地选了毛主席的另一条语录来学：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”现在，毛主席的这句名言已深深地记在每个青年成员的脑子里了。
          我们有了革命的方向和力量
    这个支部的一些青年成员在谈到他们学习《毛主席语录》的收获时，告诉记者下面一些例子：针对帝国主义和反动分子常常以造谣的手法来欺骗他们、分裂他们，他们就反复背诵毛主席的这一句极为重要的话：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”又如：在斗争中，青年成员们常会碰到一些困难。每当碰到困难和感到疲倦时，他们就朗读《毛主席语录》中有关革命英雄主义的指示。
    开始时，自愿参加这一学习的有二十五个青年，现在已发展到四十五个成员了。有些青年成员除了自己学习外，还负责组织支部所属的各小组抄写和学习毛主席语录。
    这批参加学习的青年兴奋地向记者说：“我们热爱《毛主席语录》，因为它是我们革命道路上的明灯，它给了我们革命的方向和力量。”“《毛主席语录》对世界革命的一切问题，都有答案。”“我们要象毛主席所教导的那样，不仅仅从理论上学，还要在实践中用。”
