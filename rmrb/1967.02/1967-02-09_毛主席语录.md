	To seize national victory is only the first step in the long march of ten thousand li. ...
	China's revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is even longer, the work even greater, and the struggle even more arduous. This point must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must be made to continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impetuosity. Comrades must also be made to continue to maintain the style of hard work and self-reliance.

	From the Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    毛主席语录
    夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。
       《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》
