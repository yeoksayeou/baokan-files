Our overseas institutions' staff have been holding meetings or sending telegrams over the past few days to vehemently denounce the Soviet revisionist authorities for instigating thugs to break into our embassy in the Soviet Union, smash and loot the news picture windows, and brutally assault our diplomatic representatives and staff. This is a new fascist atrocity.

The staff of the Chinese Embassy in North Korea, the Pyongyang branch of Xinhua News Agency, the Pyongyang office of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and Chinese construction workers working on the embassy's construction project held a meeting on the 5th to vehemently denounce the Soviet revisionist authorities for instigating thugs to assault our diplomatic representatives, staff, and Xinhua reporters at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, and destroy the embassy's news picture windows. This is a heinous crime.

Speakers unanimously expressed their determination to learn from all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, to learn from their revolutionary actions of holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, fearing no violence, fearing no sacrifice, and using their blood to defend the dignity of our great motherland. They vowed to fight to the end against all ghosts and monsters in the world, letting the brilliant light of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought shine over the entire world.

The staff of the Chinese Embassy in Poland and other institutions in Poland held a protest meeting on the 4th, exposing the counter-revolutionary nature of the Soviet revisionist traitors and strongly protesting the Soviet authorities' bloody crime of assaulting Chinese diplomatic personnel. The meeting passed a telegram of condolences to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and the Xinhua branch.

All Chinese personnel in Japan held a protest meeting at the Liaozhengzhi Office's Tokyo Liaison Office on the 4th.

All comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the United Arab Republic, the Consulate General in Sidon, the Cairo branch of Xinhua News Agency, and the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization held a protest meeting in Cairo in the afternoon of the 5th and unanimously passed a telegram to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union.

The telegram said that the Soviet revisionist authorities are afraid of revolution, afraid of truth, afraid of the people, afraid of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and afraid of the Soviet people knowing the truth about the "January 25" Red Square massacre. They regard a few pictures reflecting the facts as a monstrous flood, fearing to death. This fully exposes the weak nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

The telegram expressed full support for the four solemn demands presented by the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

All personnel of the Chinese Embassy in Algeria and the Xinhua News Agency's Algiers branch held a protest meeting in the evening of the 5th. The meeting passed a telegram of condolences to all anti-revisionist comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and the Xinhua News Agency's Moscow branch, saying, "We are determined to learn from your revolutionary spirit, to learn from your shining example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and to carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism to the end."

The telegram pointed out that this new heinous crime committed by the Soviet revisionists only shows that the Soviet revisionists are paper tigers and a handful of dirt that will be swept away by the revolutionary people.

All personnel of the Chinese Embassy in Iraq and the Xinhua News Agency's Baghdad branch held a meeting on the 5th. Attendees angrily pointed out that the Soviet authorities, disregarding the warnings and strongest protests of the Chinese government and people, have, in just ten days, repeatedly provoked the great Chinese people. This is intolerable to the 700 million Chinese people. The blood debt owed by the Soviet revisionist leadership must be repaid in blood.

All revolutionary comrades at the Chinese Embassy in Romania and the Xinhua News Agency's Bucharest branch sent a telegram to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, saying, "This fascist atrocity by the Soviet revisionists is another serious provocation against the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and another blood debt owed to the Chinese people."

All comrades at the Chinese Embassy in Cuba, the Xinhua News Agency's Havana branch, and Chinese experts working in Cuba jointly wrote a letter to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 5th, saying, "You are models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and you are the standard-bearers of red diplomats who are loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely learn from your shining example and study Chairman Mao's works even better, holding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher."

All staff of the Chinese Embassy in Zambia sent a telegram to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 5th, saying, "Truth cannot be blocked. The brilliant sunlight of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will definitely shine on the homeland of the October Revolution. The great Soviet people will definitely rise up to overthrow the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, remove their officials, seize their power, and seize their politics. A bright red, brand-new Soviet Union will appear before the people of the world!"

All revolutionary comrades at the Chinese Embassy in Burma, the Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch, the Rangoon office of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and Chinese experts working in Burma sent a telegram to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 5th, saying, "Your fearless and victorious revolutionary spirit has crushed the arrogance of all ghosts and monsters and boosted the morale of all revolutionary people. You have defended the great Mao Zedong Thought and the dignity of our great motherland. You are truly good students of the great Chairman Mao and diplomatic warriors of the 700 million Chinese people. You have set a shining example for our diplomatic personnel."

All comrades at the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and the Xinhua News Agency branch sent a telegram to all comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and the Xinhua branch on the 5th, saying, "We will definitely learn from your thorough revolutionary spirit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fearing no violence, fighting resolutely, and using your blood to defend the dignity of our great motherland. We vow to fight to the end for the revolutionary cause of all peoples of the world, for the thorough victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the world, and to carry the struggle against revisionism to the end."
