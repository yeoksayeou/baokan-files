Recently, we visited heroic Albania. During those unforgettable days, we deeply felt that the Albanian people have infinite love for Chairman Mao and infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought. Everywhere we went, we heard the Albanian people enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao as the contemporary Lenin, as the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, and praising Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful weapon to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionary people around the world.

Everyone Recites Chairman Mao's Telegram

When we visited Albania, it was just after the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party had concluded. This congress not only advanced Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new stage but also pushed the revolutionary friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania to a new stage. Chairman Mao's telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party had a fervent response among the Albanian people, bringing them tremendous encouragement.

When we visited the port of friendship between China and Albania—Durrës—we met with the female director of the cigarette factory, Iliriana. She excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's telegram is a great encouragement to us. Everyone here has read the telegram. The friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a true revolutionary friendship."

In a mountainous area in central Albania, we met an old partisan named Delvish. After attending the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, he gave five consecutive lectures to the people of Blad Village about Chairman Mao's telegram. The villagers of this mountain village were overjoyed after hearing Chairman Mao's telegram. They proudly discussed how Chairman Mao compared Albania to a great socialist beacon in Europe and to a towering mountain reaching into the sky, and compared modern revisionism to a handful of dirt. The word "dirt" in Albanian sounds very similar to "cow dung." After hearing the telegram, the villagers unanimously said, "Chairman Mao said it perfectly! Modern revisionists are nothing but a handful of dirt, a handful of cow dung!" The Albanian comrades also said, "Chairman Mao compared Albania to a towering mountain reaching into the sky. We should say that the People's Republic of China, built and led by Chairman Mao, is an even higher mountain reaching into the sky."

The Albanian People Always Think of Chairman Mao

The Albanian people always think of Chairman Mao. No matter where we went, people always eagerly asked us for Chairman Mao's badges. When they received Chairman Mao's badges or portraits, they always showed the most excited and happiest emotions.

When we visited the Lezhë District, a military officer named Gjikici enthusiastically came up to us, took a Chairman Mao badge, and immediately pinned it to his chest. He excitedly said, "Now I am with Chairman Mao every day. I will defend Chairman Mao with my chest!"

In the Troshan Agricultural Cooperative in the Lezhë District, the sincere love for Chairman Mao expressed by the cadres and members left a deep impression on us. At a warm and friendly gathering, people sang and danced, using the most beautiful language to praise Chairman Mao. A 13 or 14-year-old student, Plak, wrote a poem praising Chairman Mao and the new China, and recited it on the spot with a powerful and passionate voice:

Great socialist China,
You shake the imperialist world.
Leading you forward is
The unparalleled great leader Mao Zedong.
Mao Zedong Thought spreads far and wide,
The red flag of Marxism-Leninism flies high in victory.

The Albanian people infinitely love Chairman Mao's works. Many places have study groups for Chairman Mao's works, and many active learners of Chairman Mao's works have emerged. They draw great spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's works. The workers at the Ferri Fertilizer Plant, which is under construction, while studying the open letter of the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee, seriously studied relevant works by Chairman Mao. They realized that to complete the tasks given by the Party, they must dare to think and dare to act, and forge a path in practice.

After studying, many comrades displayed a high level of revolutionary spirit. Regardless of wind or rain, they continued to work outdoors on high platforms. Some people voluntarily continued to work after getting off work, contributing their greatest efforts to the construction of the factory. The advanced welder Ganani not only seriously reads Chairman Mao's works but also applies Mao Zedong Thought well in practice. He felt the great power of Mao Zedong Thought from his own experience. He said, "Every word of Chairman Mao is like a great book. We have Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and we feel extremely proud."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Will Surely Win

The Albanian people gave enthusiastic praise to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

During our visit to Albania, it was precisely when Chairman Mao was receiving revolutionary students and Red Guards for the eighth time. Chairman Mao's great initiative to receive millions of revolutionary young people, his great example of always being with the people, caring for the people, trusting the people, and supporting the people, greatly encouraged the Albanian people and youth. When we visited a mountainous area, many young people asked us to describe the lively scene of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards. After hearing our account, they happily said, "Although we have not been able to see Chairman Mao in person at Tiananmen Square, hearing your description makes us equally happy."

Last year in February and March, the Albanian youth held a "Long March" activity to learn revolutionary traditions. We met a group of young people in Tirana who had participated in this "Long March." They enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praised the Red Guards taught by Chairman Mao. The son of a revolutionary martyr, Shadini, immediately gave us a badge of the Albanian Youth League to pass on to the Chinese Red Guards who marched to Beijing. He said, "We want to learn from the Chinese Red Guards. We wish the revolutionary youth of China victory as they advance along the path of Mao Zedong!"

In Hoxha's hometown of Gjirokastër, the district party secretary, Shala, met with us and enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. He told us that the Albanian people are very concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and have learned a lot from it. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. It has dealt a heavy blow to modern revisionism, making imperialism feel shocked, and the enemy's dream of restoring capitalism in China has been shattered. The workers at the Ferri Fertilizer Plant said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is very good! Albanian workers enthusiastically praise it and firmly support it. In this cultural revolution, great Mao Zedong Thought will surely win, and revisionism will surely be thoroughly smashed!"

    阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱毛主席
    最近，我们访问了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚。在那些难忘的日子里，我们深深地感受到，阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。我们到处听到阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈赞颂毛主席是当代的列宁，是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义的最强大武器，毛主席是全世界革命人民心中的红太阳。
          人人传颂毛主席的贺电
    我们访问阿尔巴尼亚的时候，正值阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会刚刚开过不久。这次大会不但把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推进到一个新的阶段，同时也把中阿两党和两国人民的革命友谊推进到一个新的阶段。毛主席致劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电，在阿尔巴尼亚人民心中产生了热烈的反响，给阿尔巴尼亚人民带来巨大的鼓舞力量。
    我们在中阿友谊之港——都拉斯访问时，卷烟厂女厂长伊林娜激动地说：“毛主席的贺电对我们是极大的鼓舞，我们这里的每个人都读了贺电。由毛泽东同志和霍查同志亲手缔造的中阿人民的友谊，是真正的革命友谊。”
    在阿尔巴尼亚中部的一个山区，我们和一位名叫德尔维什的老游击队员见了面。他在参加劳动党第五次代表大会以后，接连五次向布拉德村的群众宣讲了毛主席的贺电。这个山村的群众听了毛主席的贺电以后，欢欣鼓舞，他们十分自豪地谈到毛主席把阿尔巴尼亚比作欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯，比作耸入云霄的高山，把现代修正主义比作一抔黄土。“黄土”这个词，在阿尔巴尼亚语里和“牛粪”的发音很相近。群众听了贺电以后，异口同声地说：“毛主席说的好极了！现代修正主义者就是一抔黄土，一抔牛粪！”阿尔巴尼亚的同志们还说：“毛主席把阿尔巴尼亚比作耸入云霄的高山，我们要说，毛主席缔造和领导的人民中国是更高的耸入云霄的高山。”
              时刻想念毛主席
    阿尔巴尼亚人民时刻想念着毛主席。不论我们走到哪里，人们总是怀着渴望的心情向我们要毛主席像章。当他们得到毛主席像章或毛主席像片的时候，总是表现出最激动、最幸福的感情。
    当我们访问莱希区的时候，人民军干部吉基奇热情地来到我们跟前，要了一枚毛主席像章，随即佩戴在胸前，兴奋地说：“这样我就天天和毛主席在一起了，我要用胸膛来保卫毛主席！”
    在莱希区的特洛沙尼农业合作社，干部和社员们所表达的热爱毛主席的真挚感情，给我们留下了难忘的印象。在热情友好的联欢会上，人们载歌载舞，用最美好的语言赞颂毛主席。一个十三四岁的中学生普来格写了一首歌颂毛主席、赞扬新中国的诗歌，并且用激昂有力的声调当场朗诵：
    伟大的社会主义中国啊，
    你把帝国主义世界震撼。
    率领你前进的，
    是举世无双的伟大领袖毛泽东。
    毛泽东思想传四方，
    马克思主义的红旗胜利飘扬。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱毛主席著作。很多地方都有学习毛主席著作的小组，涌现出许多学习毛主席著作的积极分子。他们从毛主席著作中吸取了巨大的精神力量。正在建设中的费里氮肥厂的职工们，在学习阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的公开信的同时，认真学习了毛主席的有关著作，认识到要完成党所交给的任务，就要敢想敢干，到实践中去闯出一条路子。
    学习以后，许多同志发扬了高度的革命精神，不管刮风下雨，照样在室外的高架上进行作业，有的人在下班以后主动要求继续工作，为建厂贡献自己最大的力量。先进的焊接工人加纳尼不仅认真读毛主席著作，而且把毛泽东思想很好地运用到实践中去。他从自己的切身体会中感受到毛泽东思想的巨大威力。他说：“毛主席的每一句话等于一本巨著。我们有毛主席和霍查同志，感到无比骄傲。”
          中国文化大革命一定胜利
    阿尔巴尼亚人民对于毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，给予了热烈的赞扬。
    我们在阿尔巴尼亚访问期间，正是毛主席第八次接见革命师生和红卫兵的时候。毛主席接见千百万革命小将的伟大创举，毛主席无比关心群众、信任群众、支持群众，永远和群众在一起的伟大榜样，使阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年感到极大的鼓舞。当我们在一个山区访问时，许多青年要求我们讲述毛主席接见红卫兵的生动情景，他们听了以后，高兴地说：“我们虽然没有能够到天安门前亲眼看到毛主席，但是听了你们的介绍，我们同样感到非常幸福。”
    阿尔巴尼亚的青年去年二、三月间曾经举行了一次学习革命传统的“长征”活动。我们在地拉那和参加过这次“长征”的一群青年见了面。他们热情赞颂毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，热情赞扬毛主席教导的红卫兵。一位革命烈士的儿子沙迪尼，当场把一枚阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟的徽章交给我们，要我们转赠给长征到北京的中国红卫兵。他说：“我们要向中国的红卫兵学习，我们祝中国的革命青年沿着毛泽东的道路胜利前进！”
    在霍查同志的家乡纪诺卡斯特，区委书记沙拉同志同我们见面时，热烈赞颂毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命。他告诉我们，阿尔巴尼亚人民非常关心中国无产阶级文化大革命，从中国的文化大革命中学到很多东西。中国文化大革命是在毛泽东同志亲自领导下进行的，它沉重打击了现代修正主义，使帝国主义感到震惊，敌人企图在中国复辟资本主义的梦想破灭了。费里氮肥厂的工人们说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很！阿尔巴尼亚的工人热烈赞扬它，坚决支持它。在这场文化大革命中，伟大的毛泽东思想一定胜利，修正主义一定要被彻底粉碎！”
