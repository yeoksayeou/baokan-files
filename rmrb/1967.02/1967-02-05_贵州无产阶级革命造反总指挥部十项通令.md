The Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Proletariat in Guizhou, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advances victoriously. It resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely seizes the power of the party, government, finance, and culture from the hands of those in power who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary rebels must model themselves on the great instructions of Chairman Mao, seize the revolution, and promote production. Those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line must accept the leadership and supervision of the revolutionary rebels, await their disposal, and not make trouble. In dealing with those in power, one must start from their specific circumstances, differentiate treatment, and handle them differently. A small handful of stubborn elements in the "protection" faction should quickly surrender to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A few "spectator" elements, as long as they genuinely shift to the left, are still welcome by the revolutionaries. Revolution must be implemented against counter-revolutionaries, and they must be firmly suppressed. All revolutionary mass organizations must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and eliminate from their minds all the remaining poison of the private ownership system. It is announced that all instructions related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution issued by the Southwest Bureau and the former Guizhou Provincial and Guiyang Municipal Committees are invalid. All announcements and orders issued by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Proletariat in Guizhou must be strictly carried out.

A thunderclap, the proletarian revolutionaries in Guizhou have taken power and become the masters. A small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road in the Guizhou Provincial Committee have been finished. Truth will always defeat the devil. All the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world must stand under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. To resolutely carry out and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we issue the following orders:

1. The proletarian revolutionaries, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance victoriously. Resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely seize the power of the party, government, finance, and culture from the hands of those in power who are taking the capitalist road.

2. After seizing power, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, a temporary revolutionary committee of Guizhou Province guided by Mao Zedong Thought should be quickly established. The committee's members should be democratically elected by the revolutionary rebels. This committee, before the establishment of a new party committee, is the supreme leading body. All subordinate units and personnel must obey the commands of the revolutionary committee and gradually establish a new revolutionary order under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary committee should, according to Chairman Mao's instruction to "seize the revolution and promote production," establish several executive bodies.

Seizing power is the beginning of the revolution, not the end. After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels must fully play the role of the state machine. The revolutionary rebels must model themselves on Chairman Mao's great instructions to "seize the revolution and promote production."

3. After seizing power, those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line must accept the leadership and supervision of the revolutionary rebels, await their disposal, and not make trouble. They must strive to complete the tasks assigned by the revolutionary rebels and seek to redeem their sins.

Those who have fled and are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line should immediately return to their units. Those who voluntarily return will not be severely punished. Those who refuse to report will be arrested and investigated. Those who harbor them will be appropriately punished.

The revolutionary rebels must be vigilant. Those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line will not accept defeat. They will certainly use soft and hard tactics, corruption, infiltration, division, and other means to create splits, sabotage the great alliance of revolutionary rebels, and wait for an opportunity to counterattack. We must be on guard against this.

4. In dealing with those in power, one must start from their specific circumstances, differentiate treatment, and handle them differently. The main point is to look at their attitude towards our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the masses. The policy is to seize, dismiss, promote, retain, and transfer. Seize refers to seizing those who are extremely evil and stubborn among the fourth category of cadres pointed out in the Sixteen Articles. This is an individual case. Dismiss refers to dismissing those in the fourth category pointed out in the Sixteen Articles. This is a minority. Promote refers to promoting those in the first category and part of the second category pointed out in the Sixteen Articles. Retain refers to retaining those in the second category and the third category who have genuinely repented among those pointed out in the Sixteen Articles. Transfer refers to transferring those in the third category pointed out in the Sixteen Articles from their leadership positions and assigning them appropriate work. In short, through the test of the Cultural Revolution, cadres must be re-ranked.

5. A small handful of stubborn elements in the "protection" faction, listen up: your ancestor has "died a natural death," the tide has turned, what are you protecting? Do you insist on clinging to their corpse? Quickly surrender to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Surrendering to truth is glorious, not shameful. The revolutionary rebels can be lenient and generous. If you insist on stubbornness and protect to the end, you will be cut off from the people.

In places and departments where the rightists and conservatives have seized power, their actions are illegal and invalid.

6. There are still a few "spectator" elements. They are the branch stores of the "protection" faction. Until now, they have not expressed their stance, views, and political attitudes. They seem impartial and unbiased, but in fact, they lean to the right. They are like weeds, blown by the wind in both directions. Once the revolution is victorious, they will still "revolutionize." Such people are experts in the bourgeois "business." Time waits for no one, it's time to take a stand. As long as you genuinely shift to the left, the revolutionaries still welcome you.

7. It is particularly important to note that a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, in collusion with counter-revolutionary and bad elements, have bought off a few labor traitors, usurped the leadership of some mass organizations, opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, used the name of the Central Committee to issue orders, deceived the masses, sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, refused to implement the Sixteen Articles and various policies, acted arbitrarily, committed atrocities, and engaged in economism and sectarianism. They stirred up trouble between workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals. They are ambitious, recruiting soldiers and accepting surrenders, absorbing a large number of ghosts and snakes from society, directing their spears at the revolutionary rebels, and even at the People's Liberation Army, attempting to seize power in Guizhou and the Southwest to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals. In fact, they are active promoters of the bourgeois reactionary line and direct allies of the bourgeoisie in power. Against them, dictatorship must be implemented, and they must be firmly suppressed; otherwise, the great democracy of the proletariat cannot be guaranteed.

Our policy is: (1) The ringleaders must be dealt with; (2) Confession is lenient, resistance is strict; (3) The small leaders of the reactionary groups, as long as they voluntarily surrender and report, and do not conspire to sabotage, will not be arrested or humiliated; (4) Those who are deceived and misled by the masses will not be pursued, and they are required to expose the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries; (5) All mass organizations must be thoroughly rectified politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and all ghosts and snakes must be cleaned out; (6) All reactionary organizations should be disbanded and dissolved, and their main members should be strictly examined by the revolutionary rebels. Those who are extremely evil should be arrested and punished according to law.

8. All revolutionary mass organizations must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out thorough ideological revolutionization, implement democratic centralism, break with the private, establish the public, firmly oppose windism, mountainism, small-groupism, individualism, and ultra-democracy, and eliminate from their minds all the remaining poison of the private ownership system.

9. Due to the active implementation and stubborn insistence on the bourgeois reactionary line by the Southwest Bureau and the former provincial and municipal committees, this headquarters solemnly declares: All instructions related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution issued by the Southwest Bureau and the former provincial and municipal committees are invalid, and we call on the revolutionary rebels in the Southwest region to unite and seize back the power held by a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line within the Southwest Bureau!

10. All announcements and orders issued by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Proletariat in Guizhou must be strictly carried out.

This order takes effect immediately upon publication. Anyone who violates the above provisions will be dealt with for sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    新华社贵阳四日电　贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部十项通令
    一声春雷，贵州无产阶级革命派掌权当家了，贵州省委中一小撮走资本主义道路当权派完蛋了。真理总是要战胜魔鬼的，全中国、全世界的革命人民一定要站到毛泽东思想伟大红旗下来。为了坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们发出如下通令：
    一、无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进。坚决、彻底、干净、全部地从走资本主义道路当权派手中，把党、政、财、文大权统统夺过来。
    二、夺权以后，在革命造反总指挥部主持下，应很快建立毛泽东思想贵州省临时革命委员会。委员会的产生，由革命造反派民主推选。这个委员会在新的党委尚未建立以前，是全权领导机构，所属单位和人员都应听从革命委员会指挥，逐步建立在毛泽东思想指导下的革命新秩序。
    革命委员会应根据毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，设立若干执行机构。
    夺权是革命的开始，而不是革命的终结。夺权以后，革命造反派应充分发挥国家机器的职能，革命造反派必须模范执行毛主席的伟大指示“抓革命，促生产”。
    三、夺权以后，走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，必须接受革命造反派的领导和监督，听候处理，不许乱说乱动，必须努力完成革命造反派交给的任务，争取立功赎罪。
    凡逃跑在外的走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线者，应立即回本单位报到。自动返回者，可以不加重处分。凡抗不报到者，即予逮捕查究。窝藏不报者，须受相当处分。
    革命造反派必须提高警惕。走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，他们决不会甘心失败。他们必然会采取软硬兼施、腐蚀侵袭、分化瓦解、拉出去、打进来等种种手法制造分裂，破坏革命造反派大联合，待机反扑。我们必须提防这一手。
    四、对待当权派，应从他们的具体情况出发，区别对待，作不同的处理。主要看他们对待最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席、毛泽东思想的态度和对待群众的态度，采取一抓、二罢、三提、四留、五调的方针。抓，就是抓十六条中指出的第四种干部中的罪大恶极分子和死顽固分子。这是个别的。罢，就是罢十六条中所指的第四种干部。这是少数的。提，就是提十六条中所指的第一种干部和部分第二种干部。留，即十六条中所指的第二种干部和第三种确有悔改的干部。调，即十六条中所指的第三种干部，调离他们的领导岗位，分配适当工作。总之，通过文化大革命的考验，对干部要重新排队。
    五、“保”字派的一小撮顽固分子，你们听着：你们的祖师爷已经“寿终正寝”，大势已去，你们还保什么呢？难道你们硬要抱住他们的僵尸不放么？赶快向毛主席的革命路线投降。向真理投降是光荣而不是耻辱。革命造反派可以宽大和优待。如果执迷不悟，死保到底，那就是自绝于人民。
    凡发生右派和保守派夺权的地方和部门，他们的行动是非法的，一律无效。
    六、还有少数观潮派，他们是“保”字号的分店。直到现在，他们还不表示自己的立场、观点和政治态度。他们貌似公正，不偏不倚，实际上他们向右偏得很。他们是墙头草，风吹两边倒，一旦革命胜利，他们照样“革命”。这种人可谓精通资产阶级的“生意经”。时不我待，该表态了。只要真正向左倒，革命派还是欢迎的。
    七、特别要提请人们注意的是，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结反坏分子，收买少数工贼，篡夺了个别群众组织的领导权。他们反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想、反对无产阶级专政，盗用中央名义，发号施令，欺哄群众，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，拒不执行十六条和各项政策，横行霸道，胡作非为，大搞经济主义、宗派主义，挑拨工人、农民和革命知识分子的关系。他们野心勃勃，招兵买马，招降纳叛，大量吸收社会上的牛鬼蛇神，把矛头指向革命造反派，甚至指向人民解放军，妄图夺取贵州和西南的大权，以便达到其反革命的目的。实际上他们是资产阶级反动路线的积极推销者，是资产阶级当权派的直接同盟军。对于他们，必须实行专政，坚决镇压，否则就不能保证无产阶级的大民主。
    我们的政策是：（一）首恶必办；（二）坦白从宽，抗拒从严；（三）反动集团中的小头目，凡自动投诚报到，不再阴谋破坏者，一律不加逮捕，不加侮辱；（四）凡受欺骗蒙蔽的群众，概不追究，要求他们起来揭发反革命分子的罪行；（五）各群众组织必须彻底从政治上、思想上、组织上加以整顿，把牛鬼蛇神一概清洗出去；（六）凡属反动组织，应予取缔和解散，其主要成员应由革命造反派严加审查，罪大恶极者应逮捕法办。
    八、所有革命群众组织，都应高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化，实行民主集中制，破私立公，坚决反对风头主义，山头主义，小团体主义，个人主义和极端民主化，从思想上消灭私有制度留下的一切余毒。
    九、由于西南局和前省、市委积极地执行和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线，本总指挥部郑重宣告：对西南局和前省、市委所发出的一切有关无产阶级文化大革命的指示宣布无效，并呼吁西南地区革命造反派联合起来，把西南局内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子所把持的权力，坚决夺回到无产阶级革命造反派手中！
    十、贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部发出的一切通告和通令，必须坚决执行。
    本通令自公布之日起立即生效，若有违反以上各条者，一律以破坏无产阶级文化大革命查处。
        贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部
                    一九六七年二月三日
