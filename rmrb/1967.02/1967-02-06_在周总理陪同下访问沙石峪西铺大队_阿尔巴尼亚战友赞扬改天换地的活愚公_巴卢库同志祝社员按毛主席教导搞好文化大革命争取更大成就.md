By Alabania comrades led by Bekir Balluku and Xito Qiaoke, accompanied by Zhou Enlai and other comrades, visited Shashiyu Brigade of Yugezhuang People's Commune and Xipu Brigade of Jianming People's Commune in Xian County, Hebei Province today. They were warmly welcomed by the commune members.

Today, all the people of Shashiyu Brigade and Xipu Brigade came out to welcome the Albanian comrades. The fully armed militiamen, the Red Guards with red armbands, and the male and female commune members lined up to greet the Albanian comrades. When the helicopter carrying Zhou Enlai, Balluku, and others landed at the village entrance, the leaders of the production brigade's Cultural Revolution Committee and the Red Guards went to the helicopter to warmly shake hands with Balluku and others. The welcoming crowd held up portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted, "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship! Long live Enver Hoxha! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They enthusiastically welcomed the comrades from the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism.

Before liberation, Shashiyu Brigade was a famous poor mountain village known for its "soil like pearls and water like oil, with rocks all over the mountains." After liberation, the commune members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, displayed the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, transforming barren mountains into fertile fields. The Albanian comrades visited the reservoir and the newly reclaimed terraced fields here. Balluku praised the revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members during the visit.

Xipu Brigade is also famous nationwide. During the cooperative period, the commune members followed Chairman Mao's words, adhered to the principle of thrift, and established a "bare-stick" cooperative with only "three donkey legs," which was praised by Chairman Mao. Balluku and others met with the old poor peasants who insisted on the cooperative path at that time, as well as the newly elected leaders of the Cultural Revolution Committee and the Red Guards, and were very interested in learning about the production situation and the Cultural Revolution situation of this brigade.

After visiting these two brigades, Balluku and Qiaoke both spoke to the commune members. Balluku said to the welcoming crowd before leaving Shashiyu Brigade, "You have moved mountains like Yu Gong, turning barren mountains into fertile fields to produce grain. Your hard work has given us great encouragement. Your achievements can only be explained by the fact that you have the leadership of the heroic Communist Party of China and the guidance of great Mao Zedong Thought." He said, "You are now deeply engaged in the Cultural Revolution. The unprecedented Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao has made imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries tremble with fear, while true Marxists-Leninists and revolutionary people are delighted. I hope you will carry out the Cultural Revolution according to Chairman Mao's teachings and achieve greater successes." The commune members were greatly inspired by Balluku's speech. Under the direction of Zhou Enlai, they excitedly sang "The Boat Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman" and once again shouted, "Long live Enver Hoxha! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Today, those who accompanied the Albanian comrades on the visit included Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Peng Shaohui and relevant officials Tan Jiaxu and Pan Zhenwu.

    在周总理陪同下访问沙石峪西铺大队
    阿尔巴尼亚战友赞扬改天换地的活愚公
    巴卢库同志祝社员按毛主席教导搞好文化大革命争取更大成就
    新华社五日讯　由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团，今天，由中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来等陪同，前往河北省遵化县岳各庄人民公社沙石峪大队和建明人民公社西铺大队参观访问，受到社员们的热烈欢迎。
    今天，沙石峪大队和西铺大队倾村出动，全副武装的民兵、佩戴红袖章的红卫兵和男女社员们，列队欢迎阿尔巴尼亚同志。当周恩来同志、巴卢库同志等乘坐的直升飞机，在村口着陆时，生产大队的文化革命委员会、红卫兵的负责人都走到飞机旁，同巴卢库同志等热烈握手问候。欢迎的人们高举毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“中阿友谊万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”热烈欢迎来自反帝反修最前线的战友。
    沙石峪大队，在解放前是有名的“土如珍珠水如油，满山遍野大石头”的穷山村，解放后这里发生了翻天覆地的变化，社员们按照毛主席的教导，发扬愚公移山的精神，把一座座荒山改造成良田。阿尔巴尼亚同志们在这里参观了蓄水池和新开垦出的大片梯田。巴卢库同志在参观时，热情赞扬社员们的革命干劲。
    西铺大队也是全国闻名的地方。在合作化时期，社员们一心听毛主席的话，坚持勤俭办社的方针，办起了只有“三条驴腿”的“穷棒子”社，受到毛主席的表扬。巴卢库同志等在这里会见了当年坚持走合作化道路的老贫农，和新选出的文化革命委员会、红卫兵的负责人，很有兴趣地了解这个大队的生产情况和文化大革命情况。
    巴卢库同志和恰科同志在这两个大队参观后，都分别向社员们讲了话。巴卢库同志在临离开沙石峪大队时，对欢迎的人们说，你们象愚公一样移了山，把荒山变成了良田生产粮食。你们辛勤劳动，给了我们很大鼓舞。你们的成就，只能有一个解释，就是因为你们有英雄的中国共产党的领导，有伟大的毛泽东思想的教导。他说，你们现在正深入开展文化大革命。毛主席亲自发动的史无前例的文化大革命，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派怕得要死，而真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民感到高兴。希望你们按照毛主席的教导，搞好文化大革命。祝沙石峪大队取得更大的成就。
    社员们听了巴卢库同志的讲话，受到很大鼓舞，在周恩来同志指挥下，兴奋地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，并再次高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    今天陪同阿尔巴尼亚同志参观的，还有中国人民解放军副总参谋长彭绍辉和有关方面的负责人谭家述、潘振武等。
