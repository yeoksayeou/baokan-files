I am the leader of the "Producers" brigade of the new Beijing University. In the past, I only thought about improving the work of my brigade, always busy and bustling. Whenever our brigade's big-character posters were broadcasted and others praised us, I felt very happy. Since the training, our brigade has been incorporated into the Fifth Company. When the company or other units needed our people and things, I was reluctant to give, fearing that it would ruin the brigade I led, lose the brigade's honor, and lose face for me. When the company's work interfered with our brigade's activities, I was dissatisfied, even complaining. Comrades said I only cared about my small brigade and not others, that my parochialism was too serious, but I couldn't accept it. I thought: what parochialism?

The comrades from the People's Liberation Army who assisted our school timely grasped this active thought of mine and helped me study the article "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party." Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Parochialism, only knowing how to plan for the Fourth Army, not knowing that arming the local masses is one of the important tasks of the Red Army. This is an enlarged form of small-groupism." Indeed! I only knew how to plan for our brigade, not considering the work of the larger collective, this is parochialism. Chairman Mao also taught us: "Small-groupism. Only paying attention to the interests of one's own small group, not paying attention to the interests of the whole, seemingly not for the individual, but actually containing extremely narrow individualism, similarly having a great corrosive and centrifugal effect." The more I read, the more my face burned. Chairman Mao's words pointed out my problem accurately. My mind only paid attention to the interests of the small group, what honor, what reputation! On the surface, it was about the brigade, but in reality, it was all about "me."

The great mirror of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the dirty small-groupism in my soul, making my mind clear, my eyes bright, and my spirit more vigorous. I will, in the struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly reform the "self," seize the "self's" power, establish the "public's" power, and completely eliminate small-groupism, doing my utmost to achieve the great unity of the revolutionary faction.

    从“我”字的迷魂阵里解放出来
    张洪泉
    我是新北大“公产者”兵团的负责人。过去，我想到的就是把自己兵团的工作搞好，整天忙忙碌碌。一旦我们兵团的大字报广播了，别人称赞了，我就很高兴。整训以来，我们兵团编入五连。当连里或别的单位动用我们的人和东西时，我就不想给，怕把我领导的兵团搞垮，丢我们兵团的荣誉，丢我的面子。当连里工作挤了我们兵团的活动，我就不满意，甚至发牢骚。同志们说我只顾自己小兵团，不顾别人，本位主义太严重了，我还接受不了。心想：这有什么本位主义？
    在我校帮助工作的解放军同志及时抓住了我这个活思想，帮助我学了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》一文。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“本位主义，一切只知道为四军打算，不知道武装地方群众是红军的重要任务之一。这是一种放大了的小团体主义。”对啊！我只知道为我们兵团打算，不顾大集体的工作，这就是本位主义。毛主席又教导我们说：“小团体主义。只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”我越读脸越发烧，毛主席的话一针见血地指出了我的毛病。我脑子里只注意小团体的利益，什么荣誉呀，名声呀！表面上是说兵团，实际上都是挂在“我”的帐上。
    伟大的毛泽东思想的镜子，照出了我灵魂深处肮脏的小团体主义，使我的心明了，眼亮了，干劲更足了。我将在斗争中，以毛泽东思想为武器，大革“私”字的命，大夺“私”字的权，大立“公”字的权，彻底肃清小团体主义，为实现革命派的大联合尽自己的最大努力。
