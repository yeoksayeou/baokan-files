Our embassy staff in the Soviet Union were injured while protecting our news display. On February 9, the motherland sent a special plane to bring back the heroic anti-revisionist warriors to the side of Chairman Mao. Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly welcomed the anti-revisionist warriors at the airport and offered them heartfelt consolation.

The heroic anti-revisionist warriors, holding high the sacred five-star red flag and carrying portraits of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, stepped off the plane. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!""

Foreign friends in Beijing angrily denounced the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. They held up signs reading, "Long live Mao Zedong, the helmsman of the world revolution!" and copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Down with the Soviet revisionists!"

The People's Liberation Army loves to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly supporting the revolutionary rebels. Together with the revolutionary rebels of the capital, they angrily denounced the Soviet leadership's bloody suppression of our students and beating of our diplomats.

Our students, filled with great indignation towards the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, raised their arms and shouted, "The Soviet revisionists' anti-China policy will have no good outcome!" They also enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Famous American black leader Robert F. Williams and his wife joined Beijing revolutionary rebels in protesting against the Soviet fascist atrocities.

On February 11, hundreds of thousands of revolutionary rebels in the capital held a grand march and demonstration to strongly protest the Soviet fascist atrocities. The people shouted slogans: "Down with the Soviet revisionists!"
