After Seizing Power

The Red Rebels of Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory

Editor's Note of "Red Flag" Magazine: The article "After Seizing Power" is well-written and we hope that the revolutionary masses across the country will read it carefully. This article raises a directional issue for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: what to do after seizing power.

What to do after seizing power? The revolutionary rebels of Guanghua Timber Factory have put forward some guiding opinions. These opinions are worth the attention of revolutionary rebels in various factories and mines.

The revolutionary masses across the country, from the Yangtze River to the Great Wall, have united and launched a powerful struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. One stronghold after another has been breached, and one position after another has been reclaimed.

The red rebels of our Guanghua Timber Factory responded to Chairman Mao's great call and learned from the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai. On January 17, we seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After seizing power for just half a month, the entire factory presents a prosperous scene, with the movement booming and production flourishing.

Revolutionary Power, Production Development

For a long time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Guanghua Timber Factory have faithfully carried out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, leading the socialist enterprise onto the path of "peaceful evolution." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when the revolutionary masses rose up to rebel against them, they launched a frenzied suppression and a white terror. The red rebels would not be intimidated. So, they resorted to economism, inciting work stoppages and sabotaging production. They could do this because they held power. Could their power not be seized? Absolutely not! Their power must be seized!

At that time, some people said, "It's not the right time to seize power now; the production task is so tight this month, let's seize power next month." The red rebels firmly said, "No! Only the revolutionary masses in power can manage production well!"

The facts are exactly like this.

Power in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses can truly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Power in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses greatly liberates the productive forces. The production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, aroused during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the most important factor in promoting production.

With the victory of the struggle to seize power, a production upsurge immediately swept across the entire factory. Many workers excitedly said, "Now we are truly the masters! If we don't do it, who will? We must work hard!" The production of the 301 workshop for door panels increased from 115 panels per day to 210 panels the day after seizing power, and to 253 panels the third day, quickly reaching a record of 282 panels per day, which is 245% of the production before seizing power. The total output value of the factory in January was 400,000 yuan in the 17 days before seizing power, and 1,260,000 yuan in the 14 days after seizing power, more than three times the output of the 17 days before seizing power. All workshops in the factory completed or overfulfilled their production tasks.

The workers who are truly the masters, with the spirit of communism, have also launched technical innovations. The red rebels of the medium board cutting workshop created a fast double-roll cutting method, doubling efficiency. When the medium and large hot presses in the glue pressing workshop broke down, the mechanics rushed to repair them overnight, ensuring the normal operation of the machinery. After completing the production task ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it, the 307 workshop voluntarily sent carpenters to support the 303 workshop.

The rapid development of production after seizing power greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses, giving a powerful response to those conservative elements who wanted to laugh and find loopholes, and providing a good education for those middle-of-the-road masses who did not believe that the revolutionary rebels could lead production well. This living example further disintegrated the ranks of the conservative elements and won over and united more middle-of-the-road masses to stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

A New Thing—Revolutionary Production Committee and Revolutionary Production Service Group

Chairman Mao said, "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." After seizing power, we thoroughly smashed the old rules and regulations that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, thoroughly abolished the long-standing "three-level-one-chief" system that had ruled the enterprise, and replaced it with a new organization—the Revolutionary Production Committee and Revolutionary Production Service Group.

The old management system was an bureaucratic system imported from the Soviet revisionists that constrained the masses and hindered production. From the factory department to the sections to the workshops, a large number of non-production cadres, who did not understand the production reality, only knew how to press down tasks and demand numbers, were high above, acting like officials and lords.

Now, here, those "chiefs" and "directors" are all gone. The factory department, various workshops, and sections have established Revolutionary Production Committees or Revolutionary Production Service Groups. They are composed of several service personnel. Service personnel are elected by the red rebels. Those who study and apply Chairman Mao's works best, who are most revolutionary, and who can best connect with the masses are elected as service personnel. Those who are not qualified can be replaced at any time.

The Revolutionary Production Committee and Revolutionary Production Service Group are revolutionary organizations where the masses educate themselves, liberate themselves, and manage themselves. They have a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses and never leave the masses. Today's leaders and the led are completely comrade relationships, not relationships of ruling and being ruled. Many service personnel said, "We are the masters now, and we must not act like officials and lords, and we must not leave the masses."

Except for a few who temporarily leave their posts due to work needs, the vast majority of service personnel in the Revolutionary Production Committee and Revolutionary Production Service Group are non-production personnel. They mostly use their spare time to carry out the cultural revolution and handle production issues. The entire factory has one chief dispatcher, and each workshop has one to three planners and technicians who, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Production Committee or Revolutionary Production Service Group, specifically arrange production activities.

Some people were concerned that after breaking the old management system and reducing a large number of non-production cadres, would it be difficult to command and would production be interrupted? The facts prove that this concern is unnecessary. Service personnel directly participate in production, are most familiar with the production situation, and best understand the masses of workers, making it most convenient to command. They "come from the masses and go to the masses," consult with the masses on every matter, rely closely on the masses, and it is most convenient to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. Problems discovered in production can be quickly solved, and major problems can be solved in a timely manner after being submitted to the factory Revolutionary Production Committee for discussion. This is also an important reason why production can develop rapidly after seizing power. The masses of workers reflected, "Now the entire factory's production is commanded smoothly, and the leadership is timely."

The Revolutionary Production Committee and Revolutionary Production Service Group, although still in the initial stage, are great new things born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with a solid mass base and a bright future. They will demonstrate tremendous power in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

"Economize to Make Revolution," "Run the Factory Thriftily"

After seizing power, we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "economize to make revolution" and "run the factory thriftily."

The heads of the conservative elements in our factory used to frequently go out in small cars. After seizing power, the headquarters of the red rebels and the entire factory Revolutionary Production Committee decided: when going out to handle matters, unless it is extremely urgent, public buses or bicycles must be taken, and small cars are not allowed. Since seizing power, the small cars in the factory have been rarely used.

Cultural revolution supplies such as paper and ink are used as frugally as possible, and waste is strictly prohibited. The office and meeting room have only a few wooden desks and chairs.

The red rebels posted Chairman Mao's quotations on economizing to make revolution next to the machinery. The workers said, "The revolution must be done best, and the funds must be used least. Extravagance and waste, what revolution!"

After seizing power, we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "running the factory thriftily." Now that we are in power, the sense of ownership of the masses of workers is even stronger, and not a single piece of wood or board from the state is allowed to be wasted. The red rebels of the sixth workshop do not ask the state for high-quality coal. They said, "As long as we give full play to our subjective initiative, inferior coal can also burn the boiler well." Saving raw materials has also become a trend.

Extravagance and waste are the style of the bourgeoisie, and the former officials did just that.

Thrift and frugality are the style of the proletariat, and the workers who are now in power are doing just that.

Unite the Majority of the Masses

Our factory's seizure of power is real. We are not just seizing a couple of seals and a few offices. We have truly seized the leadership. The majority of workers enthusiastically support this seizure of power, and they willingly obey the arrangements and dispatch of the Revolutionary Production Committee and Revolutionary Production Service Group. In other words, this power is approved by the masses.

Why can we do this? Because the red rebels paid attention to uniting the majority before seizing power, and after seizing power, they paid even more attention to this work and did it more thoroughly and carefully.

We believe that the masses participating in the conservative elements' organizations are mostly deceived, so we do not discriminate against or exclude them, but persuade and educate them, uniting them on the basis of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Specifically, we study Chairman Mao's works and important documents related to the cultural revolution together and discuss them; we hold symposiums to propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the deceived and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line; we use rest time to visit homes and compare the past and present to arouse class consciousness; in life, we also care for them; and so on. In this way, we have won over and united the vast majority of the deceived masses. After they changed, they all expressed their determination: "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely follow Chairman Mao to make revolution."

We have also analyzed the cadres and treated them differently. Those who resolutely stand with the revolutionary masses have been elected into the Revolutionary Production Committee or Revolutionary Production Service Group. Those with minor problems but who are needed for work are kept on for certain tasks; those who are not needed for work are all sent to the workshops to labor with the workers. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are criticized and struggled against, supervised in labor, and made to confess their problems. In this way, we have won over a group of cadres. A cadre from the supply and marketing section, who was originally a conservative, was sent to the workshop to labor. The red rebels in the workshop actively did ideological and political work for him, and at the same time cared for him in labor and life, giving him their gloves to wear and their work clothes to put on. As a result, the cadre changed and expressed to the red rebels his desire to stay in the workshop to labor with the workers.

After the victory of seizing power, the revolutionary ranks rapidly developed, and many people rushed to join the revolutionary rebel faction. In this situation, we must pay attention to the mass nature of the organization and also pay attention to the purity of the organization. Those who genuinely want to join the revolutionary rebel faction, even if they were deceived in the past, as long as they change their stance, we warmly welcome them. However, we must be especially vigilant against those who, under the banner of "rebellion," try to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to sabotage.

Chairman Mao said, "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." To seize power, we need such "tens of millions" and "surging"; to consolidate the fruits of seizing power and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, our revolutionary ranks need to be continuously expanded and continuously improved.

Continuous Revolution, Forever Forward

In the life-and-death struggle with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, it is Chairman Mao's works that have given us boundless strength, making us "determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." Now that we are in power, the burden on our shoulders is even heavier. How can we bear this burden? We deeply feel that nothing is more important than Chairman Mao's thought taking the lead.

After seizing power, we have vigorously promoted the study of Chairman Mao's works. We have combined practice with the study of Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Some Questions on the Method of Leadership," and "The Working Method of the Party Committee" and other great works. The service personnel of the Revolutionary Production Committee, 52-year-old old worker Wei Xiuhe, like many other red rebels, often studies until late at night. He said, "Without studying Chairman Mao's works, how can I bear the burden of being a service personnel?"

In the new situation, new ideological problems will arise. Chairman Mao warned us, "Because of victory, arrogant sentiments, sentiments of self-proclamation as heroes, sentiments of stopping and not seeking progress, sentiments of indulging in enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." These erroneous ideas to varying degrees exist in the ranks of the red rebels. This has already attracted our attention. We firmly believe that through studying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we will definitely be able to overcome these erroneous ideas.

"The iron gate of the pass is like iron, but now we take the first step to cross it."

After several months of arduous struggle, we have broken through numerous obstacles, seized power, taken power, grasped revolution, and promoted production. We clearly know that this is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles. The class enemies will not readily accept defeat, and they will still make desperate struggles. Recently, a handful of reactionaries are still plotting "reversal accounts," attempting to "settle scores in autumn" and rise again. We must be highly vigilant against their plots and resolutely fight them to the end. Because of being in power, many new problems are also facing us. More severe tests are still ahead. The red rebels are welcoming new battles.

    夺权以后
    北京光华木材厂红色造反者
    《红旗》杂志编者按：《夺权以后》这篇文章写得很好，希望全国无产阶级革命派认真读一读。这篇文章对当前无产阶级文化大革命，提出了一个方向性的问题，即夺权以后怎么办。
    夺权以后怎么办？光华木材厂的革命造反派提出了一些纲领性的意见。这些意见，值得各个工矿企业的革命造反派注意。
    大江南北，长城内外，无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大夺权，其势迅猛异常，锐不可挡。一个一个的顽固堡垒被攻破了，一个一个的阵地被夺回来了。
    我们光华木材厂的红色造反者，响应毛主席的伟大号召，向上海革命造反派学习，在一月十七日从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺了权。夺权后不过半个月，全厂呈现一派兴旺气象，运动搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热火朝天。
    革命派掌权，生产大发展
    长期以来，光华木材厂党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，忠实地执行旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，使社会主义企业走上“和平演变”的道路。在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命派起来造他们的反了，他们就疯狂镇压，实行白色恐怖。红色造反者不吃这一套。于是，他们又搞经济主义，煽动停工，破坏生产。他们所以能够这样做，就是因为手里有权。他们的权能够不夺吗？不能！绝对不能！他们的权，非夺不可！
    当时有些人说：“现在夺权不是时候，这个月生产任务这么紧，下个月再夺吧。”红色造反者坚定地说：“不！只有革命派掌权，才能把生产搞好！”
    事实正是这样。
    权，掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，才能真正实现毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    权，掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，就大大解放了生产力。广大工人群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中激发起来的生产积极性，是搞好生产的最重要的因素。
    随着夺权斗争的胜利，立即在全厂范围内掀起了一个生产高潮。许多工人激动地说：“现在我们真正当家做主了，我们不干，谁干？我们要大干一场！”生产夹板门的三○一工段，夺权后第二天日产量就由一百一十五扇增至二百一十扇，第三天又增至二百五十三扇，很快又出现了日产二百八十二扇的最高纪录，为夺权前一天日产量的百分之二百四十五。全厂一月份的总产值，夺权前的十七天是四十万元，夺权后的十四天，是一百二十六万元，为夺权前的十七天的三倍多。全厂各车间都完成或超额完成了生产任务。
    真正当家作主的工人群众，共产主义精神大发扬，技术革新也开展起来了。中板铡的红色造反者创造了快速双卷铡的方法，提高效率一倍。胶压工段的中型热压机、大型热压机坏了，钳工组的同志闻讯赶到，连夜抢修，保证了机器的正常运转。三○七工段在提前超额完成生产任务后，主动抽出木工支援兄弟的三○三工段。
    夺权后生产的迅速发展，大长了革命派的志气，给那些想看笑话、钻空子的保守派以有力的回答，而对于一些还不相信革命造反派能领导好生产的中间群众，则是一个很好的教育。这个活生生的事实，进一步瓦解了保守派的队伍，争取和团结了更多的中间群众站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    崭新的事物——革命生产委员会和革命生产勤务组
    毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们夺权以后，大破不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，大破旧的规章制度，条条框框，彻底废除了长期统治企业的“三级一长制”，而代之以崭新的组织——革命生产委员会和革命生产勤务组。
    旧的管理体制，是从苏修那里贩来的束缚群众、妨碍生产的官僚主义体制。从厂部，到科室，到车间，一大批脱产干部，他们不了解生产实际，只知道向下压任务，要数字，高高在上，做官当老爷。
    现在，我们这里，那些“长”，那些“主任”，统统没有了。厂部，各车间，各科室，成立了革命生产委员会或革命生产勤务组。它们由若干勤务员组成。勤务员由红色造反者选举产生。谁活学活用毛主席著作最好，谁最革命，最能联系群众，就选谁当勤务员。不称职的，可以随时撤换。
    革命生产委员会和革命生产勤务组，是群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己管理自己的革命组织。它同群众有血肉般的联系，一刻也不脱离群众。今天的领导与被领导，完全是同志关系，而绝不是统治与被统治的关系。不少勤务员说：“我们当家了，千万不能做官当老爷，千万不能脱离群众。”
    革命生产委员会和革命生产勤务组的勤务员，除个别人确系工作需要暂时脱产外，绝大多数是不脱产的。他们大多利用业余时间，搞文化革命，处理生产上的问题。全厂设总调度员一人，车间设计划员和技术员一至三人，在革命生产委员会或革命生产勤务组领导下具体安排生产活动。
    曾经有人担心，打破了旧的管理体制，减掉了大批脱产干部，会不会指挥不灵，生产中断呢？事实证明，这种担心是多余的。勤务员直接参加生产，最熟悉生产情况，最了解工人群众，就最便于指挥。他们“从群众中来，到群众中去”，遇事同群众商量，紧紧依靠群众，就最便于发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性。生产上发现了问题，可以迅速解决，重大问题提交厂革命生产委员会研究后，也可以及时得到解决。这也是夺权后生产能够迅速发展的一个重要原因。工人群众反映：“现在全厂生产，指挥自如，领导及时。”
    革命生产委员会和革命生产勤务组，尽管目前还处于开创时期，但这个在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的伟大的新事物，是有深厚群众基础的，是有远大前途的。它将在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，显示出无比强大的威力。
    “节约闹革命”，“勤俭办工厂”
    我们掌了大权以后，坚决遵循毛主席的教导，“节约闹革命”，“勤俭办工厂”。
    我们厂的保守派的头目，以前经常乘小汽车四出活动。夺权以后，红色造反者总部和全厂革命生产委员会决定：外出办事，除非特别紧急，都乘公共汽车或骑自行车，不准坐小汽车。夺权以来，厂里的小汽车很少使用。
    文化革命用品，如纸张、油墨等，都尽量从俭，力戒浪费。办公室和会议室，只有几张木桌，几把木椅。
    红色造反者把毛主席的“节约闹革命”的语录，张贴在机器旁。工人说：“革命要搞得最好，经费要用得最少。大手大脚，铺张浪费，还搞什么革命！”
    我们夺权以后，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“勤俭办工厂”的方针。现在我们掌权了，工人群众的主人翁感更强了，国家的一根木柴，一块木板，都不允许浪费。第六车间的红色造反者，不伸手向国家要优等煤。他们说：“只要我们发挥主观能动性，次煤同样可以烧好锅炉。”节约原材料，也成了风气。
    铺张浪费，这是资产阶级作风，过去的官老爷们就是那样干的。
    勤俭节约，这是无产阶级作风，现在掌权的工人正是这样做的。
    团结群众的大多数
    我们厂夺权，夺得实在。我们并不是只夺两颗大印，几个办公室。我们是实实在在掌握了领导权。大多数工人都热烈支持这次夺权，他们是愉快地服从革命生产委员会和革命生产勤务组的安排调度的。也就是说，这个权是群众批准的。
    为什么能做到这一点？因为红色造反者在夺权前注意团结大多数，在夺权后，更加注意做这项工作，而且做得愈加深入细致了。
    我们认为，参加保守派组织的群众，其中绝大多数是受蒙蔽的，因此，不是歧视、排斥他们，而是说服教育，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的基础上团结他们。具体作法是：共同学习毛主席著作和有关文化大革命的重要文件，并一起讨论；开座谈会，向受蒙蔽的人宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，批判资产阶级反动路线；利用休息时间进行家庭访问，进行今昔对比，启发阶级觉悟；在生活上，也给予关怀；等等。这样，就争取团结了绝大多数受蒙蔽的群众。他们转变以后，纷纷表示决心：“要好好听毛主席的话，坚决跟着毛主席闹革命。”
    我们对干部也做了分析，区别对待。坚决同革命派站在一起的，有的被选入革命生产委员会或革命生产勤务组。问题不大而又工作需要的，留下作一定工作；工作不需要的，一律下车间同工人一起劳动。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，则批判斗争，监督劳动，交代问题。这样，我们就争取了一批干部。有一个供销科干部，原来是保守派的，下到车间劳动，车间的红色造反者积极向他作思想政治工作，同时在劳动上、生活上关心他，把自己的手套给他戴，工作服给他穿，结果，这个干部转变了，向红色造反者表示，要求留在车间同工人一起劳动。
    夺权胜利了，革命队伍迅速发展，许多人都纷纷要求参加革命造反派。在这种情况下，我们既要注意组织的群众性，又要注意组织的纯洁性。凡是真心要求参加革命造反派的，即使是以前受蒙蔽的，只要转变立场，我们都热烈欢迎。但是，我们要特别警惕那些打着“造反”旗号，企图混入革命队伍，进行破坏的人。
    毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”为了夺权，需要这样的“千千万万”、“浩浩荡荡”；为了巩固夺权成果，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们的革命队伍需要不断扩大，不断提高。
    不断革命，永远前进
    在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，进行你死我活的最艰苦的斗争中，是毛主席著作给了我们无穷的力量，使我们“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”现在，我们掌权了，肩上的担子更重了。怎样才能挑起这副重担呢？我们深切地体会到：千重要，万重要，毛泽东思想挂帅最重要。
    我们夺权以后，就狠抓毛主席著作学习。我们结合实际，认真学习了毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》、《党委会的工作方法》等伟大著作。革命生产委员会勤务员、五十二岁的老工人魏秀和，同其他许多红色造反者一样，常常学习到深夜。他说：“不学习毛主席著作，怎么挑起勤务员这副担子？”
    在新的形势下，会有新的思想问题发生。毛主席告诫我们说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”这些错误思想的苗头，在红色造反者的队伍中也程度不同地存在着。这一点，已经引起了我们的注意。我们深信，通过学习毛主席著作，展开批评和自我批评，一定能够克服这些错误思想。
    “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”
    经过几个月的艰苦斗争，我们冲破重重阻力，夺了权，掌了权，抓了革命，促了生产。我们清楚地知道，这只不过是万里长征走完了第一步。阶级敌人绝不甘心失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。最近，一小撮反动分子还在暗记“变天账”，妄图“秋后算账”，东山再起。我们要高度警惕他们的阴谋，坚决同他们斗争到底。因为掌权，也面临着许多新的问题。更严峻的考验，还摆在面前。红色造反者正在迎接新的战斗。
