A friend from Vietnam who is fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle recently wrote a poem titled "Long Live the Victory of Mao Zedong Thought!" The poem passionately praises the great Mao Zedong Thought. The poem reads:

My faith in Uncle Mao will never change.
A few flies buzzing around cannot cover the sun's rays.
Uncle Mao's torch illuminates the path forward for the world's people.
Amidst the roaring waves, remember Uncle Mao's teachings.
Uncle Mao said, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," greatly strengthening our resolve to win.
Uncle Mao said, "A single spark can start a prairie fire," and we must push the people's war to a new high.
Guerrilla warfare flourishes, all thanks to Uncle Mao's sixteen-character strategy:
"When the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy halts, we harass; when the enemy is tired, we attack; when the enemy retreats, we pursue."
No matter how the sea dries up and the rocks crumble, Uncle Mao's teachings will forever be in our hearts.

    毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    一位战斗在抗美斗争前线的越南朋友，最近写了一首题为《毛泽东思想胜利万岁！》的诗，热情歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想。诗中写道：我对伯伯的信仰永远不变。几只苍蝇嗡嗡叫，太阳的光芒遮盖不了。毛伯伯的火炬，照亮了世界人民前进的大道。在惊涛骇浪之中，要记住毛伯伯的谆谆教导。伯伯说过，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸
  老虎，大大地加强了我们争取胜利的信念。伯伯说：“星星之火，可以燎原”，我们要把人民战争推向高潮。游击战争蓬勃发展，全靠毛伯伯提出的十六字诀：
  “敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”。任凭海枯石烂，伯伯的教导永远记在心间。
