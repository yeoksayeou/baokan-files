The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam calls on military and civilians to bravely advance and fight to the end. The more fierce and arduous the battle, the closer to the final victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 16th, the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam recently published an article by a commentator pointing out that the military and civilians of South Vietnam, in response to the sacred call for national salvation by Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are resolutely fighting to the end for the independence and freedom of their homeland.

The article, titled "The Iron Army—The Liberation Army of South Vietnam," was published to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the unification of the armed forces of South Vietnam.

The article points out that under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the armed forces of South Vietnam have rapidly grown and strengthened in their life-and-death struggle against the most brutal imperialist invader in human history—the U.S. imperialists. Today, it has become a patriotic army consisting of three forces: main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units. It has continuously improved its political and ideological level and combat technology, and has established a deep bond with the people.

The article states that the people's war in South Vietnam has reached a very high level, and the military and civilians of South Vietnam have put the enemy in a state of comprehensive distress: enemy troops have been heavily casualties and disintegrated, and the puppet regime is on the verge of collapse.

The article points out that the war-mongering and obstinate U.S. aggressors, in order to save themselves from the crisis of complete failure, have since 1965 sent a large number of U.S. troops to invade South Vietnam and blatantly launched a local war. However, the armed forces of South Vietnam gave them a crushing blow as soon as the U.S. troops entered South Vietnam.

The article says that from the initial skirmishes between the Liberation Army of South Vietnam and the U.S. troops in South Vietnam, it can be concluded that the invasion army of the most powerful imperialist in the capitalist world—America—is completely defeatable.

The article says: The U.S. imperialists, who are in a state of failure, are frantically sending more invasion troops to South Vietnam and intensifying their sabotage of the North. However, the facts clearly show that the U.S. aggressors, using nearly a million U.S. and puppet troops and henchmen, and exhausting all kinds of vicious means and tricks, have still suffered defeat. Therefore, even if they increase their troops by tens of thousands now, they can only suffer even more devastating defeats. Although the battle will be more arduous and fierce, it is precisely the time when the final victory of the people of South Vietnam is approaching.

The article concludes by saying that the people of South Vietnam, together with their heroic liberation armed forces and compatriots throughout the country, resolutely respond to the sacred call for national salvation by Chairman Ho and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, bravely advance, and fight to the end for independence and freedom. South Vietnam will definitely be liberated! The patriotic and iron-like armed forces of South Vietnam will definitely win!

    南越解放通讯社号召军民奋勇直前坚决战斗到底
    战斗越是艰巨激烈，越是接近最后胜利
    据新华社河内十六日电　越南南方解放通讯社最近发表评论员文章指出，越南南方军民坚决同全体越南人民一道，响应胡志明主席和越南南方民族解放阵线的神圣救国号召，为夺取祖国的独立和自由而坚决战斗到底。
    这篇题为《钢铁的军队——越南南方解放军》的文章，是为庆祝越南南方解放武装力量统一六周年而发表的。
    文章指出，在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下的越南南方解放武装力量，在同人类历史上最残暴的头号帝国主义——美帝国主义的侵略军进行你死我活的斗争中，已经迅速地成长和壮大起来。今天，它已成了一支包括主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队三种力量的爱国军队。它在政治思想水平和战斗技术水平方面不断得到了提高，并同人民建立了血肉联系。
    文章说，越南南方的人民战争已经发展到了很高的水平，越南南方军民使敌人陷入了全面困窘的境地：敌军被大量消灭和瓦解，伪政权摇摇欲坠。
    文章指出，好战和顽固的美国侵略者为挽救彻底失败的危机，从一九六五年起，大规模派遣美军侵略越南南方，明目张胆地发动一场局部战争。但是，越南南方解放武装力量在美军刚一进入越南南方的时候，就给予它们迎头痛击。
    文章说，从越南南方解放军和美军在越南南方的局部战争中进行的初步较量中，可以得出结论：资本主义世界最强大的一个帝国主义——美国的侵略军是完全可以打败的。
    文章说：陷于失败窘境的美帝国主义正在疯狂地向越南南方增派侵略军和加强对北方的破坏。但是，事实清楚地表明，美国侵略者使用了近百万的美伪军和帮凶军，用尽了一切恶毒手段和阴谋诡计而仍然遭到失败，那么，现在即使它再增加几十万军队，也只能遭到更加惨重的失败。战斗虽然会更加艰巨、激烈，但也正是越南南方人民最后胜利即将到来的时候。
    文章最后说，越南南方人民坚决同自己的英雄的解放武装力量和全国同胞一道，响应胡主席和越南南方民族解放阵线的神圣的救国号召，奋勇直前，为夺取独立和自由而坚决战斗到底。越南南方一定要解放！爱国的、钢铁般的越南南方解放武装力量一定胜利！
