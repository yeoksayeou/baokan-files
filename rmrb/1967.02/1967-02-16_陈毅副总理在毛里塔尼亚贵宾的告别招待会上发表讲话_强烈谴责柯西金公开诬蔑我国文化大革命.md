	Vice Premier Chen Yi today strongly condemned Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin for distorting facts and slandering China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution during his visit to Britain. Kosygin attempted to shift the blame for the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations onto China and even viciously attacked our great leader Chairman Mao.

	Chen Yi said that the Soviet revisionist leading clique has once again taken the lead in opposing China, which shows that they are at their wits' end. Their frenzied anti-China actions do not indicate their strength but rather expose their weakness.

	Chen Yi pointed out forcefully that no matter how fiercely imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries around the world howl against China, they cannot stop the victorious advance of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, nor can they diminish the brilliance of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chen Yi made these remarks at a farewell banquet hosted by the Mauritanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Planning. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is an unprecedented revolution that touches the souls of people. It is a new, deeper, and broader stage in the development of China's socialist revolution. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to prevent revisionism from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state and to prevent the restoration of capitalism in China. This will further consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, greatly promote the development of socialist construction, and thereby strengthen our support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

	Chen Yi said that imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries around the world are terrified of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have joined forces to frenziedly launch a new wave of anti-China sentiment. The Soviet revisionist leading clique has once again taken the lead in opposing China. In recent periods, they have even more brutally suppressed our students studying in the Soviet Union, assaulted our diplomatic personnel, and pushed Sino-Soviet relations to the brink of rupture. Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, during his visit to Britain, actually distorted facts, attempting to shift the blame for the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations onto China. He publicly slandered our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rudely interfered in our internal affairs, and even viciously attacked our great leader Chairman Mao.

	Chen Yi solemnly declared that the Soviet revisionist leading clique is at their wits' end. Their frenzied anti-China actions do not indicate their strength but rather expose their weakness.

    陈毅副总理在毛里塔尼亚贵宾的告别招待会上发表讲话
    强烈谴责柯西金公开诬蔑我国文化大革命
    帝修反的反华狂吠，绝不能阻挡我国文化大革命胜利前进，丝毫损害不了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉苏修领导集团再次充当反华急先锋，把中苏两国关系推向到破裂的边缘，恰恰暴露他们“黔驴技穷”，虚弱得很
    新华社十五日讯　国务院副总理陈毅今天强烈谴责苏联部长会议主席柯西金在访问英国期间颠倒黑白，企图把恶化中苏两国关系的责任推到中国身上，并公开诬蔑我国的无产阶级文化大革命，粗暴干涉我国内政，甚至恶毒攻击我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    陈毅副总理说，苏联修正主义领导集团再一次充当反华急先锋，说明他们已经是“黔驴技穷”。他们猖狂反华一点也不表明他们的强大，恰恰暴露了他们的虚弱。
    陈毅副总理有力地指出，帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派不论怎样发出反华的狂吠，绝不能阻挡我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进，丝毫也损害不了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉。
    陈毅副总理是在毛里塔尼亚外交、计划部长举行的告别招待会上讲这些话的。他在讲话中说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场史无前例的触及人们灵魂的大革命，是我国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。我国无产阶级文化大革命就是要在我国防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义的复辟。这将进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政，大大推动社会主义建设事业的发展，从而有力地加强我国支援世界人民革命斗争的力量。
    陈毅副总理说，对于我国的无产阶级文化大革命，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派怕得要死，他们勾结起来疯狂地掀起了一股新的反华逆流。苏联修正主义领导集团再一次充当了反华的急先锋。最近一个时期以来，他们更血腥镇压我国留学生，殴打我国外交人员，把中苏两国关系推向到破裂的边缘。苏联部长会议主席柯西金在访问英国期间竟颠倒黑白，企图把恶化中苏两国关系的责任推到中国身上，并且公开诬蔑我国的无产阶级文化大革命，粗暴干涉我国内政，甚至恶毒攻击我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    陈毅副总理严正指出，苏联修正主义领导集团已经是“黔驴技穷”。他们猖狂反华一点也不表明他们的强大，恰恰暴露了他们的虚弱。
