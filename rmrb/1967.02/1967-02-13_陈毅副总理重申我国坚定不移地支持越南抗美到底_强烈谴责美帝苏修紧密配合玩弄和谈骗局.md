Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterates China's unshakable support for Vietnam's struggle against the U.S. to the end

Strongly condemns U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism for colluding to stage a fraudulent peace talk charade

Sternly points out: The heroic Vietnamese people cannot be crushed by force, intimidated by threats, or deceived by tricks. The Chinese people are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with their Vietnamese brothers to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam.

New China News Agency, February 12th: Vice Premier Chen Yi today strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for increasingly brazenly and blatantly playing a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, using escalated bombing and intensified warfare to push for "peace talks," and using the smoke screen of "peace talks" to cover up the crimes of escalated bombing and intensified warfare.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique for colluding with U.S. imperialism at every turn, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people and sacrifice the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said tonight at a banquet welcoming the government delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, that at present, the revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces of the whole world are engaged in repeated and fierce struggles. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. and for national salvation is the focal point of this great struggle. U.S. imperialism, in order to salvage its fate of total failure in Vietnam, is shamelessly playing a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, using escalated bombing and intensified warfare to push for "peace talks," and using the smoke screen of "peace talks" to cover up the crimes of escalated bombing and intensified warfare. At present, it is increasingly brazen and blatant in pushing the peace talk charade. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, on the other hand, colludes with it at every turn, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people and sacrifice the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the heroic Vietnamese people cannot be crushed by force, intimidated by threats, or deceived by tricks. They have long made up their minds to fight to the end for the complete liberation and unification of their motherland.

Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterated that the Chinese government and people will, as always, firmly and unshakably support the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. for national salvation. We are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with our Vietnamese brothers until we drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam. The Chinese people are also fully prepared, and if the U.S. dares to expand the war to China, it will surely receive a devastating blow from us.
