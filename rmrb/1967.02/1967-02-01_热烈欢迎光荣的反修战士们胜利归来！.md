We have been eagerly awaiting the return of our comrades who bravely fought against the Soviet revisionist thugs. They will arrive in the capital today. Let us extend our warmest welcome to our victorious comrades! Welcome back to our great motherland, and welcome back to the side of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Let us convey our warmest greetings and highest proletarian cultural revolution combat salutes to the glorious anti-revisionist fighters!

Dear comrades! In Moscow, you paid your respects to the mausoleum of the great proletarian revolutionary leader Lenin and the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin with boundless admiration and love, and you recited the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. Your actions embody the unwavering loyalty of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, including the Soviet people, to the international proletarian revolutionary cause. This revolutionary action is excellent, a thousand times good! Ten thousand times good! We wholeheartedly praise and firmly support your revolutionary actions. A handful of Soviet revisionist scoundrels were terrified, fearing the radiant Mao Zedong Thought just as bats fear the sunlight. They trembled and lashed out like cornered dogs! These scoundrels carried out bloody suppression against you, how vile!

Chairman Mao teaches us: Proletarian revolutionaries must overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them. "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and wolves." You are the revolutionaries with such fearless spirit. In the face of the fascist thugs, you stood firm and fought resolutely and bravely against the enemy. You demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of rebellion nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought among Chinese youth. In your presence, the arrogant enemy is nothing but a paper tiger. You are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the revolutionary people of the world. You are truly the good soldiers of Chairman Mao and the good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.

The fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists have sparked the indignant protests of 700 million Chinese people. In recent days, the protest marches against the Soviet revisionist atrocities in the capital have been vast and powerful, forming an unstoppable tide. The righteous voices denouncing the Soviet revisionists from all over the country have echoed through the skies. Revolutionary people all over the world have risen up to condemn the Soviet revisionists' heinous crimes. The Soviet revisionist clique has found itself in a situation where "even rats crossing the street are shouted at." The Chinese people are not to be trifled with! Anyone who dares to provoke the Chinese people will meet a bad end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the enemy opposes us, that is good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy strongly opposes us, slandering us and saying we are worthless, that is even better, that means not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but it also means our work has been very successful."

The Soviet revisionists could not wait to come out and crazily oppose us, which precisely shows that the great Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, and the end of the Soviet revisionist clique is near. This is an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop. We firmly believe that the great people of the Soviet Union will not endure the fascist rule of the handful of Soviet revisionist scoundrels for long. They will surely rise up to rebel against them and overthrow them. The great red flag of Marxism-Leninism will inevitably fly over the Kremlin.

Glorious anti-revisionist fighters, dear comrades! Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should care about state affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!" Currently, our country's cultural revolution has entered a new stage. This is a great revolution to uproot revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Let us together hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the movement, strongly oppose imperialism, strongly oppose revisionism, and strongly oppose all reactionaries. With the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, let us fight our way to a new world of red brilliance.

    热烈欢迎光荣的反修战士们胜利归来！
    我们殷切盼望着的战友，同苏修暴徒进行英勇搏斗的反修战士们，定于今天到达首都。让我们向胜利归来的战友们表示最最热烈的欢迎。欢迎你们回到我们伟大祖国的怀抱，欢迎你们回到我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的身边！让我们向光荣的反修战士们致以最亲切的慰问，致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
    亲爱的战友们！在莫斯科，你们怀着无限敬仰和热爱的心情，向伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林的陵墓敬献花圈，并朗读了伟大领袖毛主席的语录。你们的行动体现了中国人民和包括苏联人民在内的全世界革命人民对国际无产阶级革命事业的无限忠贞。这个革命行动好得很，一千个好！一万个好！我们热烈赞扬和坚决支持你们的革命行动。一小撮苏修混蛋却吓破了胆，他们害怕光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，就象蝙蝠害怕阳光一样。他们发抖了，狗急跳墙了！这些混蛋们对你们进行了血腥镇压，何其毒也！
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级革命战士要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服，“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”你们就是具有这种大无畏精神的革命战士。在法西斯暴徒面前，你们临危不惧，同敌人进行了坚决的、英勇的斗争。你们表现了毛泽东思想哺育下中国青年的无产阶级革命造反精神。在你们面前，气焰嚣张的敌人，不过是纸老虎。你们忠于毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于祖国，忠于世界革命人民，你们不愧为毛主席的好战士，中华民族的好儿女。
    苏修的法西斯暴行，激起了七亿中国人民的愤怒抗议。这几天，首都抗议苏修暴行的示威队伍，浩浩荡荡，形成了无比强大的洪流。全国各地怒斥苏修的正义吼声，响彻云霄。全世界革命人民也奋起声讨苏修的滔天罪行。苏修集团陷入了“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的困境。中国人民不是好惹的！谁胆敢向中国人民挑衅，就决没有好下场。
    毛主席教导我们：“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    苏修迫不及待地跳了出来，疯狂反对我们，正好表明，伟大的毛泽东思想是所向披靡的，苏修集团的末日临近了，这是不可抗拒的历史潮流，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。我们坚决相信，伟大的苏联人民决不会长期忍受苏修一小撮混蛋的法西斯统治，迟早会起来造他们的反，革他们的命，马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗必将飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空。
    光荣的反修战士，亲爱的战友们！毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”目前，我国的文化大革命已进入一个新的阶段。这是一场挖掉修正主义根子，防止资本主义复辟的大革命。让我们共同高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，积极投入到运动中去，大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造一切反动派的反，用无产阶级革命造反精神，杀出一个红彤彤的新世界来。
