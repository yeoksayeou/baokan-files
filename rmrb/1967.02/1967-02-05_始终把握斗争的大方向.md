Shanghai's *Wenhui Daily* published an editorial on February 1st, pointing out that the situation of the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai is very good. Currently, a reactionary backlash has emerged: some people, in an organized and planned manner, are directing the struggle's spearhead towards the Central Cultural Revolution Group and some steadfast revolutionary leftists. This is a new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line. However, no backlash can stop the surging tide of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The desperate struggles of a handful of reactionaries are merely a last gasp.

Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd: Shanghai's *Wenhui Daily* published an editorial titled "Always Grasp the Direction of the Struggle" on February 1st. The full text is as follows:

The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Shanghai is very good. The proletarian revolutionary masses are further uniting and are taking power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, it should also be noted that a reactionary backlash has emerged: some people, in an organized and planned manner, are directing the struggle's spearhead towards the Central Cultural Revolution Group and some steadfast revolutionary leftists; they even use illegal means such as kidnapping and detention to strike and persecute some revolutionary comrades; they smash some revolutionary rebel organizations that have different opinions from theirs; and they do nothing about the handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. This is completely wrong. This is a new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line.

"Even if the tree wants to be still, the wind will not cease." Class struggle within revolutionary organizations is also unavoidable. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle is an objective existence, not subject to the will of man. That is to say, it is inevitable. Man's will wants to avoid it, but it is impossible. One can only follow the trend and seize victory." In the current situation, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have openly organized conservatives to oppose the revolutionary line of the proletariat, and they are powerless; they themselves have no one to listen to them when they come out. They have been politically disintegrated, and their economic counterattack has failed. However, they are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They continue to operate behind the scenes, instructing some people who have infiltrated revolutionary organizations, or using some degenerate elements, to attack the Central Cultural Revolution Group and strike the revolutionary leftists, in order to achieve their political goal of counter-revolutionary seizure of power from the proletarian revolutionary masses. How malicious their intentions are!

If this plot is not exposed in time, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will suffer a major setback; the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses will be disrupted; the internal divisions within the proletarian revolutionary organizations will be serious; the proletarian revolutionary masses' all-out struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will be seriously affected, and even the power that has been seized may be taken back by the class enemies; while the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road can sit back and watch the "tiger fight." This serious situation will only make friends sad and enemies happy. Please consider this problem seriously, comrades who have been deceived.

Attacking the Central Cultural Revolution Group is attacking the command center of the proletariat. At the moment when the struggle for great unity and great seizure of power is most intense in Shanghai, a handful of people jump out to attack the Central Cultural Revolution Group. This is the desperate struggle of the bourgeois reactionary line, indicating that those reactionary elements are about to enter the coffin. However, no backlash can stop the surging tide of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The desperate struggles of a handful of reactionaries are merely a last gasp. Those who stubbornly adhere to the reactionary stance will ultimately end up with the shameful fate of having their "dog's head smashed"!

The "Sixteen Articles" personally formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao clearly point out that the focus of this movement is to rectify those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Revolutionary rebels should unite and seize power from the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the direction of the struggle. We revolutionary rebels must firmly grasp this direction. For the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, the current struggle should be directed at the handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. We should further unite and launch a comprehensive and thorough struggle to seize power, taking over all the Party power, administrative power, and economic power in the Shanghai region. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee has not been completely overthrown, and the revolution has not yet succeeded. There is still a lot of arduous work ahead of us. If we deviate from this direction, directing the struggle's spearhead towards steadfast revolutionary leftists and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, this is standing on the wrong side, standing on the opposite side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat, and colluding with the bourgeois reactionary line.

Some people with ulterior motives incite that directing the struggle's spearhead towards the power-holders will never be wrong. We say that this is a very harmful argument. Among the power-holders, there are bourgeois power-holders and proletarian power-holders. We must distinguish between these two types of power-holders. For the former, we must remove their positions and dismiss them; for the latter, we should trust them, support them, and support their leadership. Arguments such as "suspect all power-holders" and "overthrow all power-holders" are absolutely wrong and violate the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought class viewpoint.

In the struggle for the great alliance of revolutionary rebels to seize power from the power-holders taking the capitalist road, it is inevitable that there will be various contradictions and disputes within the revolutionary rebels. We believe that this should be resolved through consultation and negotiation, and not through illegal means such as kidnapping and detention, nor through fighting. For the shortcomings and mistakes of revolutionary rebels, of course, criticism is possible. But it must be from the standpoint of comrades, giving them enthusiastic help. If one treats comrades as enemies, then one has stood on the side of the enemy. All comrades of the revolutionary rebels should welcome good-natured criticism at any time and be vigilant against malicious attacks at any time.

Among those who attack the revolutionary leftists and attack the Central Cultural Revolution Group, a handful of leaders are intentionally launching an attack on the command center of the proletariat, while the majority are deceived and do not understand the situation. For the first type of people, if they do not stop and continue to attack the command center of the proletariat, we will impose dictatorship on them. For those who are deceived, we should help them and hope that they will admit and correct their mistakes. If they do so, we will reunite with them and fight against the enemy together. We believe that the vast majority of revolutionary rebels will criticize the responsible persons in their organizations who have made mistakes and persuade them to return to the revolutionary stance. If some people insist on their mistakes, the revolutionary masses will draw a clear line with them, fight to the end, and expose the manipulators behind the scenes.

All revolutionary rebel comrades in the city, under the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, further unite and rally together, always grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary backlash of attacking the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and do not stop until complete victory is achieved!

    始终把握斗争的大方向
    上海《文汇报》二月一日发表社论指出，上海地区无产阶级文化大革命的形势很好。目前出现了一股反动的逆流：有些人有组织、有计划地把斗争的矛头指向中央文革小组，指向一些坚定的革命左派。这是又一种资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。但是任何逆流都抵挡不住无产阶级革命派大联合的滚滚巨流。一小撮反动家伙的垂死挣扎，只不过是回光返照而已。
    新华社三日讯　上海《文汇报》二月一日发表题为《始终把握斗争的大方向》的社论，全文如下：
    上海地区无产阶级文化大革命的形势很好。无产阶级革命派正在进一步联合起来，纷纷向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。但是，也应看到，目前出现了一股反动的逆流：有些人有组织、有计划地把斗争的矛头指向中央文革小组，指向一些坚定的革命左派；他们甚至采取绑架、拘留等非法手段，打击、迫害一些革命同志；乱砸一些和自己意见不同的革命造反派组织；对于上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们反而撒手不管，不闻不问。这是完全错误的。这是又一种资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    “树欲静而风不止”，在革命组织内部，阶级斗争同样是不可避免的。毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。只能因势利导，夺取胜利。”在目前情况下，一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派公开组织保守派来反对无产阶级的革命路线，已无能为力了；他们自己出头露面，已没有多少人听他的了。他们在政治上瓦解了，经济上的反扑又破产了。但是，他们人还在，心不死，他们仍在幕后继续活动，指使一些打进革命组织内部来的人，或者利用一些蜕化变质分子，来炮打中央文革小组，打击革命左派，以达到他们向无产阶级革命派进行反夺权的政治目的，用心何其毒也！
    如果不及时识破这个阴谋，无产阶级文化大革命就要遭到重大的损失；无产阶级革命派的大联合，就要遭到破坏；无产阶级的革命组织内部，就会出现大分裂；无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开全面的夺权斗争，就会受到严重的影响，甚至已经夺到的权，有可能被阶级敌人再夺回去；而那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，却可以阴险地在一旁“坐山观虎斗”。这一严重情况，只能使亲者痛、仇者快。请那些受蒙蔽的同志，严肃地考虑一下这个问题。
    炮打中央文革小组就是炮打无产阶级的司令部。在上海地区正在进行大联合、大夺权斗争最激烈的时刻，一小撮人跳出来炮打中央文革小组，这正是资产阶级反动路线的垂死挣扎，表明了那些反动人物快进棺材了。但是任何逆流都抵挡不住无产阶级革命派大联合的滚滚巨流。一小撮反动家伙的垂死挣扎，只不过是回光返照而已。谁要顽固地坚持反动立场，最后只能落个被“砸烂狗头”的可耻下场！
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条中明确指出，这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。革命造反派联合起来，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，这是斗争的大方向。我们革命造反派必须紧紧把握住这个大方向。对于上海的革命造反派来说，当前应把斗争的矛头集中指向上海市委一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人。我们要进一步联合起来，进行一场全面的、彻底的夺权斗争，把上海地区的党权、政权、财权，统统夺过来。上海市委尚未彻底打倒，革命尚未成功，目前还有许多艰苦的工作等待着我们去做。如果离开这个大方向，把斗争的矛头转向坚定的革命左派，指向中央文革小组，这就是站错了立场，站到无产阶级革命路线的对立面去了，与资产阶级反动路线同流合污了。
    有些别有用心的人煽动说，把斗争的矛头指向当权派总是不会错的。我们说，这是十分有害的论调。当权派中，有的是资产阶级的当权派，有的是无产阶级的当权派。我们一定要分清这两种当权派。对于前者，我们一定要撤他的职，罢他的官；对于后者，我们应该信任他，支持他，拥护他的领导。什么“怀疑一切当权派”、什么“打倒一切当权派”等等，这些论调都是绝对错误的，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的。
    在革命造反派大联合，向走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，革命造反派内部免不了产生这样那样的矛盾，出现这样那样的争执。我们认为，这应当采取协商和谈判的方式解决，而绝不应当采取绑架、拘留等等非法手段，绝不应当采取武斗的办法。对于革命造反派的缺点错误，当然可以批评。但必须站在同志的立场上，满腔热情地给以帮助。如果用对待敌人的办法来对待同志，那自己就站到敌人的立场上去了。一切革命造反派的同志，既要随时欢迎善意的批评，又要随时警惕恶意的攻击。
    那些攻击革命左派、炮打中央文革小组的人，其中一小撮头头是蓄意向无产阶级司令部发动进攻的，其他大多数人是受了蒙蔽，认识不清的。对于第一种人，如果再不悬崖勒马，继续炮打无产阶级司令部，我们要对他们实行专政。对那些受蒙蔽的人，应给予帮助，希望他们承认错误，改正错误。假如这样做了，我们就和他们重新团结起来，共同对敌。我们相信，绝大多数革命造反派必定会起来批判自己组织的某些犯了错误的负责人，规劝他们回到革命的立场上来。如果某些人仍然坚持错误，革命群众就要同他们划清界限，斗争到底，把幕后的操纵人揪出来示众。
    全市革命造反派战友们，在毛泽东思想红旗下，进一步联合起来，团结起来，始终把握斗争的大方向，坚决、彻底地粉碎炮打中央文革小组的反革命逆流，不获全胜，决不收兵！
