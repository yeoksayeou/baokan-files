    Ode to the Red Revolutionary Rebels
    When the banner of "Rebellion is justified" is raised, the five continents and four seas cheer in unison. Chairman Mao personally initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the revolutionary rebels closely followed. The red revolutionary rebels, a new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought! They stand firm against evil winds and strange currents, and their feet do not waver in the face of great storms! They vow to defend Chairman Mao, daring to climb mountains of knives and descend into seas of fire! The red revolutionary rebels, a new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought! They seize the revolution and promote production, shouldering heavy burdens and marching forward; they smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the songs of victory echo to the heavens! The red revolutionary rebels, a new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought! We are the revolutionary vanguards, growing strong through struggle, leading the fight against imperialism and revisionism, forever safeguarding the iron-clad mountains and rivers of spring! The red revolutionary rebels, we are the red descendants of our great leader Chairman Mao! We beat the war drums and march forward, never turning back until the revolution is complete, forging a bright red new world!
