The workers' movement and the peasants' movement have risen up. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat have united and are seizing the reins of power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road. This is truly a great "chaos." Comrades, this "chaos" is so right, so good!

In our proletarian dictatorship, some places and departments still do not have the reins of power completely in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. This situation can no longer continue. Clearly, it is our world, so why do some units only see the capitalist lords issuing orders? Why have some units, for seventeen years, often seen "this movement, that movement, and after the movement, they suppress the masses"? Why, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, do some people start by suppressing the masses, and now they still have a "settling of accounts" after the autumn? Why can those who take the capitalist road still play tricks, shoot sugar bullets, and deceive and confuse some of the masses? It is because the reins of power are still in their hands. These bastards, at the moment of their death, can sacrifice and abandon everything, but they will not "give up power."

They have "power, power, power" in their minds, but why should we not have "power, power, power" in our minds? They do not give up power, so we seize it!

"You are ambitious," "you are arbitrary," "you want to be officials" ... The bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party are so afraid of the revolutionary masses seizing power, so eager to hastily accuse them of crimes! In their eyes, the revolutionary masses seizing power is unthinkable, is that not "overthrowing the heavens"?

However, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have always enthusiastically praised the heroes who "overthrow the heavens."

In ancient Chinese mythology, there is a giant named Gonggong. He fought with the god who ruled the heavens and earth, Zhurong, over "power." At the most intense moment of the struggle, Gonggong fiercely rammed the pillar of the heavens, the Buzhou Mountain, causing a great "chaos" that shook the heavens and earth, and alarmed Nüwa to come and "repair the heavens." This event has always been attacked by the ruling class as a "great crime." They insulted Gonggong's actions as "invading the lords," intending to "contend for the throne," as tyranny. To prevent future generations from being like Gonggong and causing "chaos," they fabricated that Gonggong died after ramming the Buzhou Mountain.

"Sweeping away thousands of troops like a mat." Our great leader Chairman Mao refuted all the insults against Gonggong, saying: "Gonggong is a victorious hero. Look, 'Angrily he rammed the Buzhou Mountain, the pillar of the heavens broke, the cords of the earth snapped. The heavens tilted to the northwest, so the sun, moon, and stars moved; the earth did not fill the southeast, so the water and dust flowed back.' Did he die? It is not said. It seems he did not die, Gonggong was indeed victorious." Chairman Mao's words restored the true image of the rebellious hero Gonggong in ancient mythology. Gonggong, this fearless giant, hated the world where the sun, moon, and stars did not move, and the rivers and dust did not flow. He stood up to "seize power," and in his anger, he smashed the old world to pieces, beginning a new world where the sun and moon move in the sky, and the rivers flow on the earth!

Such great merit, such a hero, has been buried and insulted for thousands of years, why should we not reverse his case? "Overthrowing the heavens" is nothing to fear! "Overturning the earth" is nothing to fear! "The heavens and earth are overturned, and the sentiment is grand," it is very good!

Rebellion is justified, revolution is justified, seizing power is justified, overthrowing the heavens is justified. Everything that the oppressors of the people consider unjust is justified!

"Awaken thousands and millions of workers and peasants, unite in heart, under the red flag at the foot of Buzhou Mountain, chaos reigns." The thousands and millions of workers and peasants united with the revolutionary rebels as the core are today's Gonggong. We will seize power, we will overthrow the heavens, we will unite, cooperate, and rebel greatly. We will definitely "chaos" out a new world where the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flies everywhere! All the Nüwa-style masons, go to hell!

    赞革命之“乱”
    北京第二机床厂革命造反总部《驱虎豹》战报编辑部
    工人运动、农民运动起来了，无产阶级革命派大联合，向走资本主义道路的当权派夺起印把子来了。这真是天下大“乱”。同志们，这个“乱”，“乱”得何等的对、何等的好呵！
    在我们无产阶级专政的国家，一些地方和部门的印把子却没有完全掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，这种情形再不能继续下去了。分明是我们的天下，为什么有些单位只见资产阶级老爷们发号施令呢？为什么十七年来，有的单位往往是“这运动，那运动，运动后期整群众”？为什么在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，有些家伙一开头就整群众，整到如今还留下个“秋后算帐”的狺狺狂叫？为什么那帮走资本主义道路的当权派仍然能耍阴谋、放糖弹，拉拢蒙蔽一部分群众？就因为印把子还在他们手里。这帮混蛋垂死之时什么都可以牺牲放弃，就是不肯“弃权”。
    他们一脑子“权权权”，为什么我们一脑子不应当是“权权权”。他们不弃权，我们就夺权！
      “你们是野心家”，“你们独断专行”，“你们想当官”……。资产阶级及其在党内的代理人对革命派“夺权”是何等地害怕呀，是何等地迫不及待横加罪名呀！在他们看来，革命派“夺权”了不得，那岂不是“翻天”了？
    然而，无产阶级革命派却始终对“翻天”的英雄给予热情的歌颂。
    中国古代神话中有一个叫共工的巨人，他和统治天地的大神?顼争“权”，在搏斗最激烈的时刻，共工用头狠狠撞倒了支撑天地的不周山，惹了一场天翻地覆的大“乱”，惊动了女娲出来“补天”。这件事一直被统治阶级当作“大逆不道”，加以攻击。他们辱骂共工的行为是“侵陵诸侯”，意在“争王”，是霸道。为了防止后世不再象共工那样“乱”来，他们就编造说共工是撞不周山碰死了。
      “横扫千军如卷席。”我们伟大的领袖毛主席驳倒了一切对共工的谩骂，他说：“共工是胜利的英雄。你看，‘怒而触不周之山，天柱折，地维绝。天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉；地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归焉。’他死了没有呢？没有说。看来是没有死，共工是确实胜利了。”毛主席这几句话恢复了古代神话中的造反英雄共工的本来面貌。共工这个大无畏的巨人就是痛恨那个日月星辰都不移动，江河尘埃都不漂流的世界，他就站出来“夺权”，一怒之下，就把旧世界撞个稀巴烂，开始了日月经天，江河行地的新世界！
    这样的奇勋，如此的英雄，被埋没侮辱了几千年，为什么不应该替他翻案？“翻天”有何不可？“覆地”有何不可？“天翻地覆慨而慷”，好得很！
    造反有理，革命有理，夺权有理，翻天有理。一切压迫人民的人认为无理的，统统有理！
    “唤起工农千百万，同心干，不周山下红旗乱。”以革命造反派为核心团结起来的千百万工农是今日的共工。我们要夺权，我们要翻天，我们联合起来，同心协力，大造其反。我们一定能“乱”出一个毛泽东思想伟大红旗处处飘扬的红彤彤的新世界！一切女娲式的泥瓦匠统统见鬼去吧！
