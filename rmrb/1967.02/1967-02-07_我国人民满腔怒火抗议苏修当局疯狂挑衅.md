All reactionaries who oppose the great Chinese people will meet a bad end!
The people of our country are filled with righteous indignation and protest against the Soviet revisionist authorities' mad provocations
Massive demonstrations are held in the capital and various places to firmly support the statement of our government and to demand a settlement of both the new and old accounts owed by the Soviet revisionists
Revolutionary rebels firmly believe that the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will rise up to rebel against the heads of the Soviet revisionists and sweep away the garbage in the Kremlin with an iron broom

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated February 6, revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in various parts of our country continued to hold massive demonstrations today, expressing their firm support for the statement of our government and warning the Soviet government that China's sovereignty is inviolable. The people angrily pointed out that the bloody incident on Red Square on January 25 and the new anti-China incident on February 3 were both meticulously planned and deliberately instigated by the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet government must bear full responsibility for this and must fully implement all the demands put forward in the statement of the Chinese government, not a single bit less.

Revolutionary masses in various places emphasized that the Soviet revisionist leadership organized thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, shamelessly carrying out destruction and violence, which is a blatant violation of China's sovereignty, a breach of the most basic diplomatic norms, and the most serious crime against Sino-Soviet relations. This is a great insult to the great People's Republic of China and the great 700 million Chinese people, and it is absolutely intolerable. The Soviet revisionist leadership's assault on our diplomatic personnel has placed them on par with the most barbaric imperialists and the most brutal fascists. They have smeared the face of the great Soviet people, desecrated the birthplace of the October Revolution, and their crimes are heinous. They will not have a good end. The people pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is accelerating its own doom, and the day when the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will settle accounts with them is not far off! The day when the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will sweep away the garbage in the Kremlin with an iron broom is approaching! The revolutionary people of the world are eagerly awaiting the dawn of Marxism-Leninism's victory that will rise over the Soviet land.

Today, revolutionary masses in the capital continued to hold massive demonstrations in front of the Soviet Embassy. From morning to night, the area around the Soviet Embassy on Anti-Revisionism Road was filled with the roar of angry slogans. The walls and ground in front of the Soviet Embassy were covered with protest letters, slogans, and cartoons denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists. The revolutionary masses, filled with indignation, raised their fists and shouted, "Down with the Soviet revisionists!" "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" "Those who oppose China will not have a good end!" The revolutionary rebels of the Beijing Third Machine Tool Factory angrily said: Recently, the Soviet revisionist leadership has escalated its horrifying anti-China bloodshed incidents, which is a serious provocation to the 700 million Chinese people. The Soviet revisionists are so terrified of a few news photos that they are driven to madness, sending fascist thugs to carry out destruction and violence. This shows that they fear the truth like ghosts fear sunlight. However, the brilliant and boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is something that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique can never block. More than 200 students who recently returned from France, Iraq, and several other countries came to the Soviet Embassy again today. They read out their protest letter against the Soviet revisionists through a loudspeaker. The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association stationed in Beijing and journalists from Botswana, Mozambique, South West Africa, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia who are participating in the third session of the Asian-African Journalists Training Class, as well as Chinese staff working in these two institutions, came to the Soviet Embassy in Beijing this afternoon to protest and demonstrate against the bloody atrocities committed by the Soviet authorities in Moscow. They held high the photo of the world's most beloved leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and handwritten slogans and small flags in various languages, chanting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Anti-imperialism means anti-revisionism!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The support of international friends for the Chinese people was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of the capital.

The revolutionary rebels and broad revolutionary masses of Guizhou Province, with a common hatred for the enemy, held protest meetings and demonstrations to severely denounce the extremely evil Soviet revisionist leadership. The revolutionary rebel workers of the Red Worker Combat Team of Mao Zedong Thought in Guizhou Province warned in their protest telegram: If the Soviet revisionist leadership dares to oppose the great Chinese people again, it will definitely be smashed to pieces by the iron fist of the people. You must bow your heads and apologize to the Chinese people, otherwise you will reap what you sow. The warriors of the "September 15" Red Guards Combat Team of Guizhou Institute of Technology said that the new and old debts owed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique to the Chinese people must be settled one by one. These traitors are most afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great influence of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The great victory of our people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely bring about a storm of world revolution, and the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be planted all over the globe. The poor and lower-middle class peasants of the Mao Zedong Thought Qiling Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang City said: Axes cannot chop off Mao Zedong Thought from the minds of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and saws cannot cut off the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union! We firmly believe that in the near future, the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism will once again fly over the sky of the Kremlin.

The broad revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses of Shanxi Province angrily condemned the new atrocities of the Soviet revisionists. The streets of Taiyuan were covered with slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!" The Red Flag Brigade of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Shanxi Province held a protest meeting, where they said that the Soviet revisionist leadership's series of provocative incidents are all aimed at our revolutionary rebels, fearing the voices of the Chinese people, and fearing Mao Zedong Thought. We revolutionary rebels will definitely walk the path of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and the doom of the Soviet revisionists is inevitable. The revolutionary rebels of the "Red Line" of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee said: The heroic people of the Soviet Union will definitely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and the Soviet people will definitely sweep away the garbage in the Kremlin with an iron broom, eliminating all harmful insects. Many young revolutionary rebels of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Brigade said with great indignation: The new and old debts owed by the Soviet revisionist leadership to the Chinese people must be settled one by one. The noose around the necks of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like is getting tighter and tighter. The sparks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China and the invincible sparks of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely spread throughout Lenin's homeland and the world.

On the afternoon of the 5th, the people of Dazhai marched in an orderly manner, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and together with revolutionary students from various places who came to link up, held a denunciation meeting. Dazhai Brigade Leader Jia Chengyan angrily pointed out at the meeting that the poor and lower-middle class peasants of Dazhai, like the people of the whole country, do not take the Soviet revisionist reactionary ruling clique seriously at all. They owe us debts that must be settled. Revolutionary students who came to link up pointed out in their speeches that the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists against our embassy in the Soviet Union further exposed their traitorous ugly faces and committed heinous crimes against China and the people of the world. The Soviet revisionists' anti-China actions will not have a good end! The great red flag of Marxism-Leninism will definitely fly high over Red Square and forever!

In the western part of the motherland, on the anti-revisionist front line of Xinjiang, the broad revolutionary masses angrily protested against the new atrocities of the Soviet revisionists. In Urumqi City, tens of thousands of revolutionary rebels and revolutionary people held a massive rally and demonstration today. People of various ethnic groups shouted in different languages: "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!" "The great Chinese people are inviolable!" "Salute to the heroic anti-revisionist fighters!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the greatest leader Mao Zedong!" Revolutionary workers and Red Guards representatives spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the new crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership only show that they are on their last legs and are struggling desperately. They are madly anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people, and they will not have a good end! One day, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will also be like us revolutionary rebels, under the guidance of the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the great spirit of daring to rebel, rebel against Brezhnev, rebel against Kosygin, seize power from the hands of the counter-revolutionary revisionists, and smash the Soviet revisionist hell. In Yining City, where 13 ethnic groups reside, revolutionary people of various ethnic groups held denunciation meetings and accusation meetings. They were particularly indignant about the Soviet revisionist leadership's instigation of thugs to destroy the photos of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and photos related to our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the office building of the People's Committee of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, six revolutionary rebel organizations of six ethnic groups were discussing how to carry the Cultural Revolution in their units and regions to the end. When the news came, the discussion meeting immediately turned into an accusation meeting and a denunciation meeting. They pointed out at the meeting that the series of provocative actions of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is another major exposure of their betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, opposition to Mao Zedong Thought, collusion with American imperialism, and alignment with reactionary forces to sing the anti-China chorus. They pointed out that the people of various ethnic groups in the Ili region particularly detest the Soviet revisionist leadership. In 1962, the Soviet revisionist leadership instigated border residents to flee and carried out subversive activities here. Now old grievances have not been resolved and new ones have been added. We, the revolutionary people of various ethnic groups in the Ili region, will not forgive them.

The third batch of refugees who just returned from Indonesia this morning, with indignation in their hearts, together with all the crew members of the Guanghua ship and revolutionary rebels from various places who came to Zhanjiang to welcome the refugees, took to the streets to hold demonstrations. The slogans "Down with Soviet revisionism" and "Soviet revisionism's anti-China actions will not have a good end" echoed through the sky of the coastal city. The refugees said that the Soviet revisionist leadership repeatedly created anti-China bloodshed incidents in Moscow, fully exposing their traitorous faces as accomplices of American imperialism. We have just returned from Indonesia, which is shrouded in white terror, and we have a deep understanding of the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in colluding with American imperialism to support the Indonesian reactionary forces in persecuting overseas Chinese. The heinous crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against the Chinese people and the people of the world must be settled! The crew members of the Guanghua ship solemnly stated: We will not only carry out the Chinese revolution but also the world revolution. We must spread Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. The future world belongs to Mao Zedong Thought! The end of the Soviet revisionist traitors is near! We firmly support the Soviet people in rising up to rebel against the Soviet revisionists.

The broad revolutionary rebel workers, students, and cadres of Tianjin, filled with great indignation, held meetings and demonstrations to strongly protest against the new fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. They warned the Soviet revisionist leadership: Your traitorous faces have been exposed to the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world. Your days are numbered, and you are increasingly difficult to get by. Although you traitors are still rampant for a while, the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the people of the world will never forgive you.

The revolutionary masses of Lanzhou, Wuhan, Nanchang, Changchun, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Lhasa, and other cities issued angry roars, unanimously expressing their determination to firmly counter the Soviet revisionist leadership's wanton provocations. In the streets of Lanzhou, the revolutionary masses held a massive demonstration. The representative of the "September 3" Revolutionary Headquarters of the Red Guards in Lanzhou angrily said: The blood of Chinese students in Europe has not dried on Red Square, and the Soviet clique has stretched out its bloody claws to create new bloodshed incidents. We warn you traitors that Lenin's homeland will not be trampled and desecrated by you demons for long. Your end is near, and the Soviet people will definitely rise up under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to rebel against you and personally eliminate you harmful insects.
