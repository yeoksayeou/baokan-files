	Zhejiang's agricultural machinery production and supply departments' revolutionary faction actively responds to Chairman Mao's great call to produce large quantities of agricultural machinery to support spring ploughing.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 26th — The proletarian revolutionary faction of Zhejiang Province's agricultural machinery production and supply departments has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have united with the broad masses of workers to produce in advance a large number of agricultural machinery and equipment to support spring ploughing. Currently, more than 400 electric rope-pulling machines, hand-held tractors, and large and medium-sized tractors, as well as water wheels and electric power irrigation equipment, have been sent to various rural people's communes.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction of Zhejiang Province's agricultural machinery production and supply departments, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and a high sense of responsibility for the socialist cause, have taken up their tasks. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works, vowing to be pioneers in revolution and models in production. Based on investigation and research, they have accelerated the production and supply of agricultural machinery needed for spring ploughing. Therefore, this year, the number, variety, and quality of agricultural machinery provided to rural areas before spring ploughing are unprecedented. This year, the number of electric rope-pulling machines for spring ploughing will be five to six times more than the same period last year. The agricultural machinery production department has also produced new hand-held tractors suitable for mountainous, semi-mountainous, and small plot farming, as well as large and medium-sized tractors for farming in plain areas without electricity. To meet the irrigation needs of spring ploughing, many factories have produced electric motors, transformers, and wires in advance and delivered them to rural communes and production teams in a timely manner. Currently, workers and poor and lower-middle peasants from more than 20 key grain-producing counties are busily installing wires, erecting poles, and setting up machinery. They have expressed their determination to install the irrigation equipment before spring ploughing and contribute to the first shot of spring ploughing production.

	This year, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Zhejiang Province's agricultural machinery production department has broken away from the past practice of "making plans in the first half of the year and rushing in the last month." They have arranged for the production of agricultural machinery in advance according to the needs of spring ploughing in rural areas. The material supply department has allocated raw materials in advance, factories have started production in advance, formulated processes, arranged equipment, and produced in advance. During the production and supply of spring ploughing agricultural machinery, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the production and supply departments has implemented large-scale cooperation. From organizing raw materials to production and supply, the organization has been relatively coordinated. There are more than 200 factories in the province that produce main components and parts for agricultural machinery. The revolutionary factions of the factories help each other and jointly study to make the production of agricultural machinery products faster and better. The revolutionary workers of some agricultural machinery factories producing electric rope-pulling machines have united with the broad masses of workers, studied together, exchanged experiences, improved processes, improved product quality, and significantly reduced costs.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction of Zhejiang Province's agricultural machinery supply department has also organized mutual adjustments according to the needs of various places to make full use of materials. They have also sent people to Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and other provinces and municipalities to organize supplies and transport materials to meet the needs of agricultural production.

    浙江农机生产和供应部门革命派积极响应毛主席伟大号召 
    赶制大批农业机械支援春耕生产
    新华社杭州二十六日电　浙江省农业机械生产和供应部门的无产阶级革命派，坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，团结广大职工，提前赶制出大批农业机械设备，支援春耕生产。现在，已经有四百多台电动绳索牵引机、手扶拖拉机和大中型拖拉机以及水轮泵、电力排灌设备，运往各地农村人民公社。
    浙江省农业机械生产和供应部门的无产阶级革命派，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对社会主义事业的高度责任感，来对待自己肩负的任务。他们活学活用毛主席著作，誓作抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范，在调查研究的基础上，加速生产和供应春耕需要的农机具。因此，今年春耕前为农村提供的农机具数量大、品种多、质量高，这是过去任何一年都不能相比的。今年投入春耕的电动绳索牵引机将比去年同期增加五至六倍；农业机械生产部门还新制造了适合山区、半山区和小块农田耕作用的手扶拖拉机，以及可供没有电源的平原地区耕作用的大中型拖拉机。为了赶上春耕灌溉需要，许多工厂生产的电动机、变压器、导线等提前出厂，及时运到农村社、队。目前二十多个重点产粮县的工人和贫下中农正紧张地架线、立杆、安装机器。他们表示：一定在春耕前安装好排灌设备，为打响春耕生产第一炮出一把力。
    今年，浙江省农业机械生产部门的无产阶级革命派，打破了过去“上半年订计划，年底搞突击”的局面。他们根据农村春耕生产的需要，及早对农业机械生产作了安排。物资部门及早调拨原料材料，工厂提前投料，制定工艺，安排设备，提前生产。在生产和供应春耕农机具的过程中，生产和供应部门的无产阶级革命派实行了大协作。从组织原料到生产供应组织得比较协调。全省生产农机主件和配件的工厂共有两百多个，厂与厂之间的无产阶级革命派互相帮助，共同研究，使农机产品生产得又快又好。生产电动绳索牵引机的一些农业机械厂的革命派工人，团结广大职工，共同研究，互相交流经验，改进工艺，使产品质量有了提高，成本显著降低。
    浙江省农业机械供应部门的无产阶级革命派，还根据各地需要，组织相互调剂，使物资充分发挥作用。他们还派人到福建、江苏、上海等省市组织货源，调运物资，以满足农业生产的需要。
