Our Chargé d'Affaires severely protests Soviet authorities for mobbing our embassy
The Soviet revisionist leadership clique's frenzied anti-China activities further deteriorate Sino-Soviet relations
Soviet police collude with a group of people to barge into our embassy and cause chaos, seriously affecting our embassy's normal operations

	BEIJING, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, made an oral statement to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 6th, severely protesting the Soviet authorities for organizing so-called "worker representatives" to disrupt the Chinese Embassy.

	The statement said that from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the 6th, you organized a large group of so-called "worker representatives" to disrupt our embassy. Many of them broke into our embassy premises, shouting and banging on the doors, attempting to rush into the embassy building. Some even climbed onto the iron gate of the embassy courtyard, and pasted anti-China materials on the main gate of the embassy courtyard, personally attacking our great leader Chairman Mao. Some even threatened to drive us away. When we repeatedly asked them to leave, they refused to go and blocked the entrance and exit of our embassy, seriously affecting the normal activities of our embassy. We strongly protest against this.

	The statement said that regarding the activities of the so-called "worker representatives," the Soviet police who were supposed to guard the embassy not only did not stop them but also allowed them to enter our embassy premises in batches.

	The statement pointed out that this new anti-China incident was completely premeditated and organized by the Soviet authorities. Starting from this morning, you have already begun preparations, with frequent police activities. They surveyed the terrain, cleared the snow from the sidewalks, and made markings. Subsequently, you also brought in police cars, filming cars, and other special vehicles.

	The statement said that this new anti-China farce further deteriorates the relations between the two countries. You created a bloody incident against our students studying in Europe in Red Square, smashed and looted our embassy's news window, and brutally beat our diplomatic personnel. Now, you have once again organized people to disrupt our embassy. The series of evil deeds you have committed will certainly arouse greater indignation among the Chinese people. Your frenzied anti-China actions will not end well.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 6 -- The Soviet revisionist leadership clique organized hundreds of so-called "worker representatives" and plainclothes agents to perform a new anti-China farce in front of and inside the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the 6th.

	Starting from the morning of the 6th, the Soviet authorities dispatched police to prepare for this new anti-China farce outside the Chinese Embassy. They surveyed the terrain, cleared the snow from the sidewalks, and made markings.

	In the afternoon around 3 p.m., the number of Soviet police in front of our embassy increased several times, with frequent comings and goings of various police cars. Film cameras, ambulances, and other vehicles gathered in front of the embassy.

	Around 5 p.m., the hundreds of people gathered by the Soviet authorities assembled in front of the embassy.

	They surrounded the embassy gate, blocking traffic. At this time, the Soviet police who were supposed to guard the embassy actually allowed some of them to enter the front courtyard of the embassy, letting them bang on the side door of the embassy office building, attempting to break into the office building. Some climbed onto the iron gate, and some pasted anti-China materials on the main gate.

	The so-called "worker representatives" pasted a so-called "resolution" of the "mass meeting supporting the Soviet government's statement" by the Likhachov Automobile Factory on the iron gate of the embassy. In this so-called "resolution," they repeatedly insulted Chairman Mao, the most beloved leader of the Chinese people. Some even shouted loudly: "Drive them away and that's it!"

	Later, these people also caused chaos by filming, taking photos, and recording sounds in the embassy courtyard and in front of the gate before leaving.

    我临时代办严重抗议苏联当局聚众到我大使馆捣乱
    苏修领导集团疯狂反华进一步恶化中苏关系
    苏联警察纵容一伙人闯入我使馆胡闹严重影响我使馆正常活动
    新华社莫斯科六日电  中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远，六日晚上向苏联外交部提出口头声明，严重抗议苏联当局组织所谓“工人代表”到中国大使馆捣乱。
    声明说，六日下午五时到七时，你们组织一大群所谓“工人代表”来我使馆捣乱，其中许多人闯入我使馆范围之内，大喊大叫，猛力敲门、推门，企图冲入使馆大楼，有人甚至爬上使馆院内的铁门，并在使馆院内的大门上张贴反华材料，对我们的伟大领袖毛主席进行人身攻击。有的人甚至威胁要把我们赶走。在我一再提出要他们离去时，他们竟然拒绝离去，并堵塞我使馆出入口，严重地影响了我使馆的正常活动。对此，我提出严重抗议。
    声明说，对于所谓“工人代表”的活动，“守卫使馆”的苏联警察不但不加以制止，反而一批批地放这些人进入我使馆范围之内。
    声明指出，这一新的反华事件，完全是苏联当局预谋组织的。从今天早晨开始，你们就已经进行准备，警察活动频繁，他们侦察地形，清扫人行道上的积雪，做出了标记。随后你们又开来了警车、摄影车及其它专用车辆。
    声明说，你们这一新的反华丑剧，进一步地恶化了中苏两国关系。你们在红场对我国留欧学生制造了流血事件，砸坏和抢走了我国大使馆新闻橱窗，残暴地殴打了我国外交人员。现在，你们又一次组织人到我国大使馆捣乱，你们干下的一桩桩坏事，必将引起中国人民的更大愤慨。你们疯狂地进行反华，是绝不会有好结果的。
    据新华社莫斯科六日电　苏联修正主义领导集团组织了数百名所谓“工人代表”和便衣特务，于六日下午五时到七时，在中国驻苏联大使馆门前和院内演出了一场反华新丑剧。
    从六日早晨起，苏联当局便派出警察，在中国大使馆外面进行这场反华新丑剧的准备工作，他们侦察地形，清扫人行道上的积雪，做标记等。
    当天下午三点多钟，我国大使馆门前的苏联警察成倍增加，各种警车往来频繁，电影摄影车、救护车等云集大使馆门前。
    近五时，苏联当局纠集的数百人聚合在大使馆门前。
    他们围在使馆门口，堵塞了交通。这时“守卫使馆”的苏联警察竟然把一部分人放入使馆前院，让他们敲打使馆办公大楼的侧门，企图闯入办公楼，有的人往铁门上爬，有的人在大门上张贴反华材料。
    所谓“工人代表”们在使馆的铁门上张贴了所谓利哈乔夫汽车工厂“支持苏联政府声明群众大会”的“决议”。在这个所谓的“决议”中数次辱骂中国人民最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。有的人甚至还高声喊叫：“把他们赶走就算啦！”
    后来，这些人又在大使馆院内和门前拍电影、照相、录音等胡闹了一场才离去。
