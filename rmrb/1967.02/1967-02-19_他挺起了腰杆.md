	He Stood Tall [Story]
	Hong Man

	Early in the morning, members of the Jian Guang Brigade were busy carrying manure, coming and going in a steady stream. Everyone was putting in their best effort to kick off the spring plowing production.

	Team leader Gui Shan, carrying a manure basket, walked over, thinking about the big-character posters the team members had put up about him. He thought: After the "Four Cleanups," the villagers trusted me and elected me as team leader. I've been working day and night for everyone, and I've never said a single word of complaint. Now, the big-character posters say I have "commandism" and "subjectivism." I accept these criticisms; I really do have these faults! But some people say I'm "stepping on others' necks to climb up," and I, Gui Shan, never had such bad intentions... The more he thought about it, the more confused he felt. He didn't have the heart to carry manure anymore and turned around to go home.

	Gui Shan's wife had never been too happy about Gui Shan being an official. With the Cultural Revolution picking up steam, Gui Shan was the target of big-character posters, and she felt embarrassed whenever she went out. Plus, with the chatty Second Aunt gossiping behind her back, saying things like "a life without officialdom is a carefree life," she felt even more uneasy.

	As soon as she saw Gui Shan's face, she understood what was going on. She snapped, "You're not cut out to be a team leader, so don't act like you are." Gui Shan's head was already in a mess, and with her words, it became even more confused. He grumbled, "Don't yell at me!" and then pulled the quilt over his head and went to sleep.

	The news spread quickly around the village. The rich peasant Second Aunt was secretly delighted. She ran around everywhere, shouting, "Gui Shan has private problems and doesn't dare to be a team leader! Hey, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs!" The poor and lower-middle peasants heard the news and were quite concerned. Everyone knew Gui Shan's stubborn temperament and knew he wouldn't be able to turn things around so easily. The poor peasants' association chairman, Old Sun, heard about the matter. Despite feeling unwell, he looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao and the highest directive on the wall, "Never forget class struggle," and rushed straight to Gui Shan's house. Gui Shan was lying on the kang, sulking. As soon as Old Sun arrived, Gui Shan quickly got up to greet him.

	They chatted for a while, and the conversation turned to the question of whether or not to be a team leader. Gui Shan's wife initially tried to interrupt, but when Old Sun mentioned the second crop seedlings, she fell silent. Last summer, when they were weeding the corn, the rich peasant Second Aunt pretended to be enthusiastic and worked quickly. On the surface, the work seemed fine. But as the saying goes, "You can't hide fire with paper, and you can't block a river with rotten mud." Second Aunt's tricks couldn't fool Gui Shan. The second crop seedlings she weeded didn't remove the roots, and later, the corn wouldn't produce ears. Gui Shan scolded her severely at the team meeting. Since then, she had hated Gui Shan and had been spreading rumors and gossip non-stop.

	As soon as the second crop seedlings were mentioned, Gui Shan's anger rose, and he shouted, "If people like Second Aunt mess things up, our team's production won't improve!" Old Sun continued, "That's right! Gui Shan, we must not forget Chairman Mao's words, never forget class struggle. Second Aunt wants to get you out of the way so that those with hidden agendas, the 'second crop seedlings,' can take over and speak for them. Can we let them turn things around and persecute us? A big maggot can't move a millstone. Gui Shan, you must stand tall! If we lie down and do nothing, we'll fall into the enemy's trap!" The more Gui Shan listened, the more he agreed. Gui Shan's wife also began to see things more clearly. Seeing that Gui Shan and his wife's worries had been resolved, Old Sun seized the opportunity and said, "Gui Shan, Second Aunt doesn't have the same heart as us. When everyone criticizes you, it's because they trust you and want you to clean up your thoughts. Even if they speak a little harshly, what's the big deal? You can't be knocked down by a few blows! Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Because we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and exposure of our shortcomings.'" Chairman Mao's words made Gui Shan feel warm and enlightened. He patted the dust off his clothes, excitedly took Old Sun's hand, and said, "Right! I'm really a blockhead. How could I not think things through? If I don't stand tall and work hard, I'll really let Chairman Mao down."

	The spring sunshine was warm, and Gui Shan led everyone to carry manure. Everyone competed with each other, and the enthusiastic spring plowing campaign was in full swing in their team.

    他挺起了腰杆〔故事〕
    红漫
    大清早，建光队的社员忙着送粪，来来往往，络绎不绝。大伙鼓足了劲，要打响春耕生产第一炮。
    生产队长贵山背着粪筐走过来，一边走一边思量着社员给自己贴的大字报。心想：打“四清”以后，老乡们信得过，选俺当队长，起早摸黑为大伙，俺没说过半个不字。如今，大字报上说俺“命令主义”、“主观主义”，这些意见俺都服，俺就是有这个毛病嘛！可有人说什么俺“踩着别人脖梗往上爬”，俺贵山可压根儿没揣这坏心眼……，越想心里越乱，粪也没心思拾了，转身就往家走。
    那贵山婶子，早先对贵山当干部就不太乐意。这阵子，无产阶级文化大革命运动兴起来，贵山被贴了大字报，自己一出门，就觉着脸上无光；再加上快嘴二婶在背后嘀嘀咕咕，说什么“无官一身轻”呀，她心里更不踏实了。
    一见贵山那脸子，她就明白了七八成。她没好气地说：“你呀，不是当队长的坯子，就别逞能了。”贵山那脑瓜子本来没开窍，经她那么一说，心里更有点乱套。他瓮声瓮气地说：“你别嚷嚷了！”说罢，蒙起被子就睡起觉来。
    这事儿很快在村里传开了。富农快嘴二婶心里暗暗高兴。她东奔西窜，到处嚷嚷：“贵山有私弊，不敢当队长啦！嘿，没鸡蛋还做不成油糕？”贫下中农听了这消息都挺关心。大伙知道贵山那股子倔脾气，没有两下子转不过弯来。贫协主任老孙大爷听说这事儿，也顾不得身子不太舒服，望了望墙上的毛主席像和“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的最高指示，就直奔贵山家。贵山正躺在炕上生闷气呢，老孙大爷一来，他赶紧起来接客。
    他们两个扯了些家常，就扯到当不当队长的问题上来了。贵山婶子起初还在一旁打岔，当老孙大爷提起了二茬苗的事儿，贵山婶子就不言语了。去年夏天薅高粱，富农快嘴二婶假积极，干得挺快，表面看，活儿干得还不含糊。可是，纸包不住火，烂泥堵不住河，快嘴二婶搞的鬼名堂，瞒不过贵山的眼睛。她薅的二茬苗，去苗不去根，过后，再长高粱就不结穗啦。贵山在社员大会上狠狠地训了她一顿。打这以后，她恨透了贵山，指桑骂槐、流言蜚语就没闲着过。
    一提起二茬苗的事儿，贵山平地起怒火，就直着脖子嚷：“让快嘴二婶这路货捣腾，咱队生产就别想搞好！”老孙大爷接着说：“对！贵山，咱们可不能忘掉毛主席的话啊，千万不要忘记阶级斗争。快嘴二婶就是想把你弄下去，让那些揣着私心的‘二茬苗’上台，替他们说话。咱能让他们翻过身来整治咱们吗！大尾巴蛆拱不动磨盘。贵山你可得挺起腰杆呀！咱们躺倒不干，就中了敌人的奸计啦！”贵山越听越入理，贵山婶子心里也开始亮堂了。老孙大爷看到贵山两口子的眉毛疙瘩解开了，就趁热打铁，接着说：“贵山，快嘴二婶跟咱大伙儿怀的可不是一个心眼呵！大伙儿对你提意见，是信得过你，要你打扫打扫脑瓜子，句把话说得重一些，算得了啥？你可不能三锤两锤就直不起腰来呀！毛主席他老人家教导我们：‘因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。’”毛主席的话，使贵山身上热呼呼的，心里亮堂堂的。他拍了拍身上的灰尘，激动地拉着老孙大爷的手说：“对！俺真是个榆木脑袋，怎么一下子就是想不开呢！俺再不挺起腰来好好干，真对不起毛主席他老人家了。”
    春光融融，贵山带着大伙去运粪。你争我赶，热火朝天的备耕高潮在咱们队里全面展开了。
