The Central Agricultural and Forestry Departments and Beijing Suburban Revolutionary Mass Organizations have issued an urgent appeal to revolutionary comrades on the agricultural front to immediately launch a new spring ploughing and production high tide while grasping the Cultural Revolution. They strive to achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap in agricultural production in the second year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

The People's Daily reports: The Central Agricultural and Forestry Departments and Beijing Suburban Revolutionary Mass Organizations have issued an urgent appeal to revolutionary comrades on the agricultural front across the country to immediately launch a spring ploughing and production high tide. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants! Revolutionary comrades on the agricultural front! All revolutionary comrades supporting agricultural production!

The farming season is urgent, and the opportunity must not be missed. We must immediately launch a spring ploughing and production high tide. To this end, we put forward the following ten urgent suggestions:

1. Immediately mobilize and launch a spring ploughing and production high tide. First, focus on accumulating, fermenting, making, and transporting fertilizer. Second, focus on drought prevention and control. In the north, ensure timely ploughing and moisture conservation; in the south, divert water to prevent drought and ensure timely spring sowing, especially in areas severely affected by drought, immediately mobilize and engage in anti-drought struggles. Third, focus on preparing materials. Seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery must all be prepared. Ensure the safety of livestock over winter, and do a good job of breeding and disease prevention. Also, focus on completing the final phase of agricultural infrastructure projects, especially those that yield benefits in the same year, and complete them as soon as possible. Winter crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and green manure must not be neglected in the field. Measures such as fertilizing, weeding, and pest control must be promptly implemented. Strive for a bumper summer harvest and lay the foundation for a full-year increase in production.

2. Immediately organize and strengthen the production leadership team. Revolution and production time must be properly arranged to ensure both are not neglected.

3. Never forget the class line. Depend on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Pay attention to uniting the middle peasants and uniting more than 95% of the people.

4. Continue to implement the policy of "grain as the key, diversified operations." Early formulation of the annual production plan is essential. Grain production must not be relaxed, especially in the eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the north, where efforts must be made to reverse the situation of grain being transported from the south to the north. Economic crops and diversified operations must also be promoted, especially in areas such as oil crops and large livestock, where efforts must be made to break through weak links.

5. Policies in rural areas that have not been newly regulated by the Central Committee must be strictly followed. Problems that need to be rectified should, in principle, be handled in the later stages of the movement. If urgent handling is required, thorough investigation and research must be conducted, and opinions must be submitted for approval by the Central Committee before implementation.

6. Strictly implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "frugal construction of the country" and "frugality in revolution." Oppose counter-revolutionary economism. According to Chairman Mao's strategic guidelines for preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, and the principles for correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, focus on completing the year-end distribution. It is absolutely not allowed to distribute seeds, feed, public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and production funds. Without special circumstances, reserve grain should not be arbitrarily used. Seeds, feed, reserve grain, public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and production funds that have already been distributed must be recovered by the authorities or relevant personnel who approved the distribution.

7. Strictly supervise those landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. They must be made to behave. They are absolutely not allowed to rebel against the poor and lower-middle peasants, absolutely not allowed to rebel against the proletariat, and absolutely not allowed to use the Cultural Revolution to engage in conspiracy and sabotage. If they dare to engage in sabotage, they must be severely punished by law.

8. Laborers who have gone out to link up and visit Beijing from communes and production brigades should be quickly persuaded to return to their communes and engage in revolution and production on the spot. Students who come to the communes to link up should be persuaded to eat, live, and work together and participate in the spring ploughing and production movement.

9. Basic-level cadres in rural areas must not lie down and do nothing, must not leave their posts without authorization, and must not pass on contradictions. Those in power who are walking the socialist path should be supported to continue doing a good job of leading; those cadres with mistakes should be helped to correct their mistakes and supervised to do a good job of work; those cadres with crimes should be warned to redeem themselves by meritorious service and atone for their sins.

10. Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants must form a closer and broader alliance with revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres. Revolutionary workers must not only support farmers in making revolution but also produce more fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and tools to support farmers in production. Farmers must produce more grain, sideline products, and economic crops to support the worker comrades. We must, with practical actions, smash all the plots and tricks of ghosts and snakes to destroy the alliance between workers and peasants.

A thousand suggestions, a million suggestions, the first is to hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. We, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, with the focus on studying the "Three Old Articles" well, overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit, achieving the thought revolution of the people, and carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance. "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

We, the revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary forces on the agricultural front, must shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. Let those who watch and wait and those who calculate see our "joke." We will definitely, while grasping the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, immediately launch a new spring ploughing and production high tide, and strive for a greater and more comprehensive leap in agricultural production in the second year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    中央农林各部和北京郊区革命群众组织向农业战线上的革命战友发出紧急建议
    在抓好文化大革命的同时立即掀起春耕生产新高潮
    力争第三个五年计划第二年的农业生产有一个更大更全面的跃进
    本报讯　中央农林各部和北京郊区革命群众组织，向全国农业战线上的革命战友们发出立即掀起春耕生产高潮的紧急建议。建议全文如下：革命的贫下中农们！农业战线的革命同志们！一切支援农业生产的革命战友们！
    现在农时紧迫，机不可失，时不再来，必须立即掀起一个春耕生产高潮。为此，我们向你们提出以下十条紧急建议：
    一、立即动员起来，掀起一个春耕生产高潮。首先要抓好积肥、沤肥、造肥、运肥。其次要抓防旱抗旱，北方要抓紧顶凌耙地，防旱保墒；南方要引水抗旱，保证适时春播，特别是旱象严重的地方，要立即动员起来，投入抗旱斗争。再次要抓物资准备，种子、化肥、农药、农机具等生产资料都要准备好；保护牲畜安全过冬，搞好配种、防疫工作。还要抓好农田基本建设的结尾工程，特别是当年发生效益的工程，尽早配套。小麦、油菜、绿肥等越冬作物的田间管理，决不能放松，追肥、中耕、防治病虫害等措施，要紧跟上去。力争夏季丰收，为全年增产打下基础。
    二、马上组织和健全生产领导班子。革命和生产的时间，要妥善安排，做到两不误。
    三、千万不要忘记阶级路线。一定要依靠贫农、下中农。注意团结中农，团结百分之九十五以上的人。
    四、继续贯彻“以粮为纲、多种经营”的方针，及早制定全年生产计划。粮食生产绝不能放松，特别是北方八个省、市、区，要尽快扭转南粮北调的局面。经济作物和多种经营，也要跟上去，特别是油料、大牲畜等薄弱环节，要重点突破。
    五、农村中各项政策，凡是中央没有做新规定的，一律按照原规定执行，不得任意更动。需要整改的问题，原则上放到运动后期处理。如急需处理者，要认真进行调查研究，提出意见，报请中央批示后实行。
    六、坚决执行毛主席关于“勤俭建国”、“要节约闹革命”的指示。反对反革命的经济主义。按照毛主席关于备战备荒为人民的战略方针和正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系的原则，抓紧搞好年终分配。绝不允许分掉种子、饲料、公积金、公益金、生产资金。没有特殊情况，不得随便动用储备粮。已经分掉的种子、饲料、储备粮、公积金、公益金、生产资金，要由批准分掉的当权派或有关人追回。
    七、把没有改造好的地富反坏右严格监督起来，要他们放老实一些。绝对不允许他们造贫下中农的反，绝对不允许他们造无产阶级的反，绝对不允许他们利用文化大革命运动进行阴谋破坏。如果他们胆敢进行破坏，要依法严办。
    八、社队外出串连、进京上访的劳力，应迅速劝说他们回社队就地闹革命，就地搞生产。到社队来串连的学生，应劝说他们同吃同住同劳动，一律参加春耕生产运动。
    九、农村基层干部，不得躺倒不干，不得擅离岗位，不能矛盾上交。对于走社会主义道路的当权派，要支持他们，让他们继续做好领导工作；对于有错误的干部，要帮助他们改正错误，监督他们做好工作；对于有罪的干部，要警诫他们戴罪立功，将功赎罪。
    十、革命的贫下中农要同革命工人、革命学生、革命干部实行更紧密更广泛的大联合。革命工人不但要支持农民闹革命，也要生产更多的化肥、农药、农机、农具，支持农民搞生产。农民要生产更多的粮食、副食品和经济作物，支援工人老大哥。我们一定要以实际行动，粉碎一切牛鬼蛇神破坏工农联盟的阴谋诡计。
    千条万条，高举毛泽东思想红旗是第一条。我们无产阶级革命造反派，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，中心是学好“老三篇”，破私立公，实现人的思想革命化，发扬自力更生的精神，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    我们革命的贫下中农和农业战线上的革命派，一定要挑起革命、生产两副重担。让那些观潮派、算帐派看我们的“笑话”吧，我们一定在抓无产阶级文化大革命的同时，立即掀起一个春耕生产新高潮，力争第三个五年计划的第二年的农业生产，有一个更大的更全面的跃进。
