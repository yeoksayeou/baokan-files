In the storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai, under the guidance and inspiration of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved great unity, concentrated their forces to expose the handful of capitalism-tending power-holders within the Party, bravely fought against the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism, thoroughly smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and from the bottom up, seized power from the handful of capitalism-tending power-holders within the Party in key units and departments of party and government organs, economy, and culture. This fundamentally turned the situation around and pushed the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai to a new stage.

At every critical moment in this struggle for power and counter-power seizure, our great leader Chairman Mao always gave the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary people of Shanghai the most intimate care and the strongest support. Chairman Mao personally approved the publication of the "Notice to the People of the Whole City of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Announcement." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai. Chairman Mao's directive on the "three-in-one combination" for joint power seizure illuminated our path of power seizure and guided us step by step forward. On February 5, based on the initial victory of the power seizure struggle from the bottom up, representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, responsible persons and revolutionary leading cadres who implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao from the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, achieved the "three-in-one combination" and seized all the power from the handful of capitalism-tending power-holders within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, establishing the highest temporary power organ in Shanghai. This is a heroic battle in which the proletarian revolutionary faction, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, seized back their dictatorship power from the handful of capitalism-tending power-holders within the Party under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

After the establishment of the local highest temporary power organ, the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai has entered a new upsurge. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" highest temporary power organ has provided strong support from the top down for the revolutionary rebel factions in various units and departments, creating more favorable conditions for power seizure from the bottom up.

After the establishment of the local highest temporary power organ, the "grasp revolution, promote production" policy has been greatly promoted, and a great situation has emerged. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are more ardent, more spirited, and more vigorous. With the clearest attitude and the most resolute actions, they have taken up the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production, continued to counterattack counter-revolutionary economism, and excellently completed their tasks. The leadership and advantages of the proletarian revolutionary faction have become a powerful driving force for the development of production.

The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee is not the end of the struggle. We are facing new tests. We must consolidate the power we have seized; we must continue to seize the power lost in all units and departments that need power seizure; we must, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, use Mao Zedong Thought to reform and build Shanghai, making it better serve the revolutionary and construction cause of our great motherland. Our future struggle tasks are more arduous and more complex. We must break through one obstacle after another on the road ahead, and smash one counterattack after another launched by class enemies. We must heighten our vigilance, keep our eyes open, and never relax our fighting spirit or be complacent.

Our most central strategic task is to resolutely carry out the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, continue to mobilize the masses, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the initiative of the masses, and unswervingly implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction, implement the "three-in-one combination," and in all units and departments that need power seizure, seize back all the power of party, government, finance, and culture usurped by the handful of capitalism-tending power-holders within the Party, and grasp and use the power well, grasp revolution and promote production, continuously raise the proletarian consciousness of the masses, and raise the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletarian revolutionary faction, making Shanghai into a big school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

February, March, and April are the critical periods for us to accomplish this task. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee specially proposes the following tasks, hoping that all revolutionary organizations and revolutionary people in the city will implement them:

(1) Our proletarian cultural revolution is a revolution under proletarian dictatorship. All revolutionary organizations in various units and districts/counties in the city should hold joint meetings of revolutionary organizations to specifically analyze which class holds the power in each item in their unit, determine whether to seize power, how to seize power, or how to grasp power after seizing it, summarize experiences, and determine their own tasks.

(1) In units where the "three-in-one combination" power seizure has been achieved or the power was originally in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction, they should grasp and use the power well, quickly grasp the tasks of revolution and production. They should continue to mobilize the masses, rely on the proletarian revolutionary leftists to unite and win over the middle elements, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and strive to carry out the revolution thoroughly. They should prevent and overcome the tendency of slackening revolutionary will and passive conservatism after power seizure, and enrich and develop the experience of the "three-in-one combination" in the process of using power.

(2) The "three-in-one combination" form should be determined according to different situations. The revolutionary committees of municipal, district, and county-level temporary highest power organs are "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees. Such revolutionary committees are composed of responsible persons of revolutionary rebel organizations that truly represent the broad masses, representatives of the local garrison of the PLA or the people's armed departments, and revolutionary leading cadres. In factory enterprises, the temporary power organs are composed of revolutionary cadres (leading cadres, general cadres, technical personnel), worker representatives (old workers, young workers), and militia representatives. In party and government organs, the temporary power organs are composed of revolutionary leading cadres, revolutionary intermediate cadres, and representatives of the revolutionary masses. Schools should gradually establish cultural revolution committees and cultural revolution small groups according to the "Sixteen Articles." The temporary power organs of key departments at the district/county/municipal level must be approved by the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. Units that have not implemented the "three-in-one combination" or have fake power seizures or extreme "left" power seizures will not be recognized.

(3) The broad proletarian revolutionary faction is the main force for achieving power seizure by the proletarian revolutionary faction in this region, department, and unit. Revolutionary mass organizations from other units can provide necessary assistance to them, but should not take over their work.

(4) The armed militia, the PLA, and the people's armed forces are the strong pillars of the temporary power organs at all levels and the firm backing of the revolutionary leftists. No mass organization or individual is allowed to arbitrarily mobilize the armed militia. Those who do so will be dealt with as counter-revolutionaries in action.

(5) For cadres, class analysis must be conducted, and the policy of distinguishing between different individuals must be adhered to. Revolutionary organizations should organize revolutionary masses and cadres at all levels to seriously study Chairman Mao's cadre policy and related editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine, unify their ideological understanding, and create necessary conditions for implementing the "three-in-one combination."

(2) Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and carry out the struggle against counter-revolutionary economism to the end, striving to complete and overfulfill the 1967 industrial and agricultural production plan.

(1) Revolutionary rebels should become models of "grasping revolution and promoting production." At all times, they should put revolution in the first place, use revolution to command production, use revolution to command work, and use revolution to command everything.

(2) The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes should seriously implement the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Throughout the Country," grasp revolution and promote production, strengthen the production team, and do a good job in spring plowing to launch a new upsurge in agricultural production. Currently, knowledge youth who have gone down to the countryside and to the mountains, support-the-border youth, farm workers, and personnel who were downsized and transferred in previous years, who are still staying in Shanghai and other places, should seriously study and resolutely implement the "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Handling the Issue of Knowledge Youth Going Down to the Countryside and to the Mountains, Petitioning, and Visiting," and immediately return to their original units.

(3) Revolutionary rebels in factories, enterprises, and institutions must resolutely implement the "Ten Provisions (Draft) on Grasp Revolution and Promote Production" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, quickly establish and strengthen the production team, implement the plan, especially strengthen cooperation, save raw materials, and ensure quality. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers in the transportation sector must ensure the smooth flow of goods and normal transportation under any circumstances. All enterprises and institutions are not allowed to arbitrarily change the labor system and engage in disguised economism. Workers supporting the construction of inland and border areas, as well as temporary workers, contract workers, rotating workers, and outsourced workers, must resolutely implement the relevant "Emergency Announcement" and "Announcement" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on February 17, and resolutely fight against counter-revolutionary economism.

(4) Revolutionary workers in the cultural, educational, health, and scientific research sectors must actively grasp revolution and promote work. While carrying out the power seizure struggle against the handful of capitalism-tending power-holders within the Party, they must firmly guard their work posts, fulfill their duties, and do a good job in all aspects of work. Primary and secondary schools and art troupes throughout the city should seriously study and resolutely implement the recent notices from the Central Committee.

(5) Generally, grassroots unit mass organizations should not retain full-time staff. The number of full-time staff in revolutionary mass organizations at the municipal, district/county, and industrial system levels should be minimized as much as possible. The revolutionary committee of the unit has the right to deal with those who arbitrarily go off duty and roam around according to the regulations on violating labor discipline; those with serious offenses and repeated violations, after being reported to and approved by the higher-level revolutionary committee, will be seriously dealt with.

(6) All mass organizations and individuals must strictly abide by the state plan and state system, and are not allowed to arbitrarily use state materials, or even turn state-owned factory enterprises into small group ownership, which is bourgeois ownership. Those who have already used state materials must return them in full, and those who have used them must be thoroughly investigated. If such phenomena are found in the future, they will be dealt with as sabotage of the socialist economy.

(3) Strengthen proletarian dictatorship, resolutely support the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary faction, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, thoroughly smash the counterattacks of class enemies, protect socialist economy, and protect the proletarian cultural revolution.

(1) All genuine revolutionary rebels on the public security, procuratorate, and judicial fronts should unite, closely cooperate with the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, and combine with the broad revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses to strengthen public security work and truly play the role of proletarian dictatorship. Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries.

(2) Resolutely suppress those who dare to oppose Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and bombard the proletarian headquarters. Those who forge central documents and instructions from central leaders, and stir up trouble will be dealt with as sabotaging the proletarian cultural revolution. Those who sabotage the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the new revolutionary order, those who refuse to reform and insist on a reactionary stance, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, habitual thieves, hooligans, and speculators must be struck down mercilessly.

(3) The so-called "Joint Action Committee," "Red Army," and all other counter-revolutionary organizations must be resolutely disbanded, and their ringleaders and backstage manipulators must be severely punished.

(4) Prevent some people with ulterior motives from inciting the masses to direct their spears at the great People's Liberation Army. Those who incite and lead the charge against military organs and disrupt military control must be severely punished according to law.

(5) It is strictly forbidden to charge into airports, radio stations, prisons, detention centers, confidential rooms, and archives for any reason. Those who do so will be dealt with as counter-revolutionaries in action. It is strictly forbidden to attack revolutionary organizations, kidnap, beat, detain, set up private courts, and set up private prisons for any reason, in violation of party and state laws. Those who do so will be punished according to law.

(6) Only the leftists are allowed to rebel, and the rightists are not allowed to revolt. Revolutionary masses who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" in the early stages of the cultural revolution should be rehabilitated. However, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and other ghosts and monsters are not allowed to use "rehabilitation" as an excuse to launch a counterattack and settle old scores, otherwise, they will be punished.

(4) All revolutionary rebel organizations and Red Guard organizations should raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, rectify their organizations, rectify their thoughts, rectify their styles, and build the proletarian revolutionary faction into a highly proletarianized, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready red army.

(1) It is suggested that all revolutionary organizations open their doors for rectification. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can get rid of bad work styles and maintain good work styles." The responsible persons of revolutionary rebel organizations should take the lead in seriously carrying out criticism and self-criticism, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and strive to become models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the rectification, we should strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions according to Chairman Mao's correct policy of handling contradictions among the people, and we must not treat revolutionary comrades in the same way as we treat enemies.

(2) All revolutionary rebels in the city must achieve great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely oppose anarchism, extreme democracy, sectarianism, guildism, and cliquism. Revolutionary organizations should, on the premise of a consistent direction of struggle, seek common ground while reserving differences and not argue endlessly over minor issues. No fighting is allowed. No smashing is allowed.

(3) The form of revolutionary rebel organizations should be conducive to great unity, conducive to power seizure, conducive to "grasping revolution and promoting production," conducive to completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform in various units, conducive to proletarian dictatorship, and conducive to the thought revolution of revolutionary rebel members. We suggest that, according to industries, systems, units, and regions, the method of combining vertical and horizontal should be adopted to build a proletarian class team. Workers' revolutionary organizations should not cross industries, regions, or develop members from schools, party and government organs, medical workers, and cultural workers, etc. Those who have already been linked should be reclassified. Students' Red Guard organizations should not develop workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to join. All demobilized and transferred military personnel organizations, so-called international and national organizations, and various organizations established for the purpose of economic demands are contrary to the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions and the regulations of the Party Central Committee and should be voluntarily disbanded. The members of these organizations can apply to join the revolutionary mass organizations of their respective units. In the process of rectifying the organizations, it is necessary to purify the proletarian revolutionary faction team and drive out the bad elements that have infiltrated.

(4) All revolutionary rebel organizations should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution," be alert to the attack of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, prevent the corruption of class enemies to the revolutionary team, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, and show off. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee instructs relevant departments to organize special teams to supervise and inspect the finances of various mass organizations. All "command posts" and "headquarters" set up in various large hotels should be relocated immediately. Excessively occupied public housing and public property should be immediately returned to the original management units and housing management departments for handling.

(5) The most fundamental construction of the proletarian revolutionary faction team is to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and study and apply Chairman Mao's works. All proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in the city should, in the great revolutionary movement of class struggle and production struggle, launch a new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Recently, we should focus on studying the brilliant works of "On Rectifying the Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," "Rectifying the Party's Work Style," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Order of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention," and "The Working Methods of the Party Committee"; study the series of instructions recently issued by the Central Committee; study the editorial of the third issue of the "Red Flag" magazine "On the Power Seizure Struggle of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction," and the editorial of the fourth issue "The Correct Attitude Towards Cadres." Persist in the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and eliminate its poison. The proletarian revolutionary faction should always take the "Three Articles" as their motto, while reforming the objective world, reform their subjective world, dare to seize the power of the "self" in their minds, dare to make a revolution in the depths of their souls, and strictly demand of themselves according to the five conditions for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao, continuously raise their proletarian consciousness, continuously improve their policy level and fighting skills, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Long live the great victory of the January Revolution!

Long live the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction!

Persist in the correct policy of the "three-in-one combination" power seizure proposed by Chairman Mao!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    当前上海文化大革命的形势和任务
    （上海市革命委员会决议草案，供各革命组织、革命群众讨论和试行）
    在“一月革命”的风暴中，上海的无产阶级革命派在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的引导和鼓舞下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，实行了大联合，集中全力揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，英勇奋战煞住了反革命经济主义的黑风，彻底粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，在党政机关和经济、文化的要害单位和部门，自下而上地从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺了权，从根本上扭转了局势，从而把上海的无产阶级文化大革命推向了一个新阶段。
    在这场夺权和反夺权斗争的每一个关键时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席总是给予上海的无产阶级革命派和革命人民以最亲切的关怀和最有力的支持。毛主席亲自批准发表了《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，毛主席关于“三结合”联合夺权的指示，照亮了我们夺权斗争的道路，引导我们一步一步地前进。二月五日，在自下而上地夺权斗争取得初步胜利的基础上，上海各革命群众组织的代表，中国人民解放军驻上海的陆、海、空部队的负责人和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的革命领导干部，实行了“三结合”，夺取了旧上海市委和市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切权力，建立了上海的临时最高权力机构。这是在无产阶级专政条件下，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回自己专政权力的一场英勇战斗！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    地方临时最高权力机构建立以后，上海的无产阶级文化大革命出现了新的高潮。革命的“三结合”的临时最高权力机构，使各单位、各部门的革命造反派得到自上而下的强有力的支持，为自下而上的夺权创造了更为有利的条件。
    地方临时最高权力机构建立以后，大大地推动了“抓革命，促生产”方针的实现，出现了一片大好形势。广大工、农、兵、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，斗志更加昂扬，精神更加振奋，意气更加风发，以最明确的态度，最坚决的行动，主动地挑起革命和生产两副重担，继续反击反革命的经济主义，出色地完成了任务。无产阶级革命派的领导和优势，成为推动生产发展的强大动力。
    上海市地方临时最高权力机构的成立，决不是斗争的结束。我们正面临着新的考验。我们必须巩固已经夺回的权力；我们必须继续在一切需要夺权的单位和部门夺回失去的权力；我们必须在无产阶级专政的条件下，用毛泽东思想改造上海、建设上海，使它更好地为伟大祖国的革命和建设事业服务。我们以后的斗争任务更艰巨、更复杂。前进道路上的一重又一重的障碍需要我们去冲破，阶级敌人挑起的一次又一次反扑需要我们去击溃，我们必须提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，决不能松懈斗志，麻痹大意。
    我们面临着的最中心的战略任务，就是坚决地贯彻执行毛主席和党中央的指示，继续放手发动群众，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，坚定不移地实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，实行“三结合”，在一切需要夺权的单位和部门，把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所窃踞的党、政、财、文大权，统统夺过来，并且掌好权，用好权，抓革命，促生产，不断提高群众的无产阶级觉悟，提高无产阶级革命派的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，把上海办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    二、三、四月，是我们实现这项任务的关键时期。上海市革命委员会特提出下面各项任务，望全市各革命组织、全市革命人民贯彻执行：
    （一）
    我们的无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级专政下的革命。全市各单位、各区、县革命组织，都应当召开革命组织的联席会议，具体地分析本单位的各项权力究竟掌握在哪个阶级的手里，确定应否夺权、如何夺权或者夺权以后如何掌权，总结经验，确定自己的任务。
    （1）在已经实现了“三结合”夺权或原来权力就掌握在无产阶级革命派手中的单位，要掌好权、用好权，迅速把革命、生产两方面的任务抓起来。要继续放手发动群众，依靠无产阶级革命左派团结、争取中间派，完成斗、批、改的任务，力求把革命搞彻底。防止、克服夺权之后松懈革命意志消极保守的倾向，在用权过程中，丰富和发展“三结合”的经验。
    （2）应当根据不同情况确定“三结合”的形式。市、区、县的临时最高权力机构是“三结合”的革命委员会。这种革命委员会，由真正代表广大群众的革命造反组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军负责人或人民武装部的代表和革命领导干部组成。在工厂企业的临时权力机构由革命干部（领导干部、一般干部、技术人员）、工人代表（老工人、青年工人）和民兵代表组成。党政机关各部门的临时权力机构，由革命领导干部、革命的中级干部和革命群众的代表组成。学校则应按十六条的规定，逐步成立文化革命委员会、文化革命小组。区、县、市一级要害部门的临时权力机构，必须报请上海市革命委员会批准。凡是没有实行“三结合”或假夺权或极“左”夺权的单位，均不予承认。
    （3）广大的无产阶级革命派，是本地区、本部门、本单位实现无产阶级革命派夺权的主要力量。外单位的革命群众组织，可以给他们以必要的援助，但是不要包办代替。
    （4）武装基干民兵、人民解放军和人民武装是各级临时权力机构的强大支柱，是革命左派的坚强后盾，任何群众组织、任何个人都不得擅自调动武装民兵，违者以现行反革命论处。
    （5）对于干部，必须进行阶级分析，坚持区别对待的方针。各革命组织应当组织革命群众和各级干部认真学习毛主席的干部政策，学习《红旗》杂志有关社论，统一思想认识，为实现“三结合”创造必要的条件。
    （二）
    坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚决执行毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的方针，把反对反革命经济主义的斗争进行到底，为完成和超额完成一九六七年工农业生产计划而奋斗。
    （1）革命造反派应该成为“抓革命，促生产”的模范。无论何时，都应该把革命放在第一位，以革命统帅生产，以革命统帅工作，以革命统帅一切。
    （2）农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部，都应该认真执行《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，抓革命，促生产，健全生产班子，做好春耕工作，掀起农业生产的新高潮。目前还在上海和外地逗留的下乡上山知识青年、支边青年、农场职工、前几年精减下放人员，都应认真学习和坚决贯彻《中共中央、国务院关于处理下乡上山知识青年外出串连、请愿、上访的通知》，立即返回本单位。
    （3）工厂、企业、事业单位的革命造反派，必须坚决地贯彻执行《中共中央关于抓革命、促生产的十条规定（草案）》，迅速建立和健全抓生产的班子，落实计划，特别注意加强协作，节约原材料，保证质量。交通运输部门的革命造反派和革命职工在任何情况下，都要确保货运畅通，运输正常。所有企业、事业单位，都不得任意改变劳动制度，搞变相的经济主义。支援内地和边疆建设的职工，以及临时工、合同工、轮换工、外包工，都应坚决贯彻执行中共中央、国务院二月十七日的有关的《紧急通告》和《通告》，坚决同反革命经济主义进行斗争。
    （4）文教卫生、科学研究等各条战线的革命职工，必须积极地抓革命，促工作，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的同时，必须坚守工作岗位，尽职尽责，做好各项工作。全市中小学和文艺团体应该认真学习和坚决执行中央最近的通知。
    （5）各基层单位群众组织一般不得保留脱产工作人员。市、区、县、产业系统一级革命群众组织的脱产工作人员名额，必须尽量减少。本单位革命委员会有权对任意脱产、在外游荡的人员，按照违反劳动纪律规定处理；情节严重而又累教不改者，在报请上一级革命委员会批准后严肃处理。
    （6）任何群众组织和任何个人都必须严格遵守国家计划和国家制度，不得擅自动用国家物资，甚至将社会主义所有制的工厂企业单位变为只替某一小团体服务的小团体所有制，即资产阶级所有制。过去已动用国家物资者，必须如数追回，已用去的也要彻底清查。今后如再发现上述现象，一律以破坏社会主义经济论处。
    （三）
    大力加强无产阶级专政，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，坚决镇压反革命，彻底击溃阶级敌人的反扑，保卫社会主义经济，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    （1）公安、检察、司法战线上的一切真正的革命造反派应当联合起来，同中国人民解放军驻沪部队密切配合，同广大革命造反派和革命群众相结合，大力加强治安保卫工作，真正发挥无产阶级专政的作用。坚决镇压反革命。
    （2）坚决镇压胆敢反对毛主席、林副主席，炮打无产阶级司令部的现行反革命分子。凡伪造中央文件和中央领导同志指示、造谣生事者，以破坏无产阶级文化大革命论处。对破坏上海市革命委员会和革命新秩序的一小撮反革命分子，对拒绝改造、坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子和惯窃、流氓阿飞、投机倒把分子，必须进行毫不留情的打击。
    （3）对所谓“联合行动委员会”、“红旗军”以及其他一切反革命组织，必须坚决取缔，严惩其首恶分子，揪出其幕后操纵者。
    （4）严防某些别有用心的人，煽动群众，把矛头指向伟大的人民解放军。凡煽动和带头冲击军事机关和破坏军事管制的坏人，必须依法严惩。
    （5）严禁以任何借口冲击机场、电台、监狱、看守所、机要室、档案室等机构，违者以现行反革命论处。严禁以任何借口袭击革命组织，进行绑架、殴打、拘押、私设公堂、私设刑房等违背党纪国法的活动，违者依法制裁。
    （6）只许左派造反，不准右派翻天。在文化大革命初期被打成“反革命”的革命群众，应当平反。但是，决不许地、富、反、坏、右等牛鬼蛇神，以“平反”为名，进行反攻倒算，否则立予制裁。
    （四）
    各革命造反派组织和红卫兵组织，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，整顿组织，整顿思想，整顿作风，把无产阶级革命派的队伍，建设成为一支非常无产阶级化，非常革命化，非常战斗化的红色大军。
    （1）建议各革命组织开门整风。毛主席教导我们：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”各革命造反组织的负责人，应当带头认真开展批评与自我批评，虚心倾听群众意见，争取成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范。在整风中，应当按照毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，决不能采取对待敌人的方式来对待革命同志。
    （2）全市革命造反派必须在毛泽东思想的基础上实行大联合，坚决反对无政府主义、极端民主化、宗派主义、行会主义和小团体主义。各革命组织之间，在斗争大方向一致的前提下，要求同存异，不要在枝节问题上争论不休。不许武斗。不许乱砸。
    （3）各革命造反组织的形式，应有利于大联合，有利于夺权斗争，有利于“抓革命，促生产”，有利于完成各单位斗、批、改的任务，有利于无产阶级专政，有利于革命造反派成员的思想革命化。我们建议按产业、按系统、按单位、按地区，实行条条与块块相结合的方式，建设无产阶级的阶级队伍。工人的革命组织，不要跨行跨业跨地区，不要发展学校师生、党政机关工作人员、医务工作者和文艺工作者等成员，已挂钩的要重新归口。学生的红卫兵组织，不要发展工人和贫下中农参加。凡是复员转业军人组织，所谓国际性、全国性的组织，以及以经济主义要求为目的成立的各种组织，都是违背毛主席指示和党中央规定的精神的，应该自动解散。这些组织的所属成员，可分别申请参加本单位的革命群众组织。在整顿组织的过程中，必须纯洁无产阶级革命派队伍，把混进来的坏人清洗出去。
    （4）各革命造反派组织应坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，防止阶级敌人对革命队伍的腐蚀，坚决反对铺张浪费，讲究排场，任意挥霍国家财富。上海市革命委员会责成有关部门组织专门小组，对各群众组织实行财务监督和检查。凡设在各大饭店的“司令部”、“总部”，自即日起一律迁出。多占的公房、公物，立即退还原主管单位和房管部门处理。
    （五）
    无产阶级革命派队伍的最根本的建设，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作。全市无产阶级革命派和革命群众，要在阶级斗争和生产斗争的伟大革命运动中，掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮。最近要重点学好《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《整顿党的作风》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》和《党委会的工作方法》等光辉著作；学习中央最近发出的一系列指示；学习《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》，和第四期社论《必须正确地对待干部》。坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒。无产阶级革命派要永远把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，勇于夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，勇于在自己灵魂深处闹革命，按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件，严格要求自己，在斗争中不断提高无产阶级觉悟，不断提高政策水平和斗争艺术，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    伟大的一月革命胜利万岁！
    无产阶级革命派大联合万岁！
    坚持毛主席的“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                      一九六七年二月二十三日
