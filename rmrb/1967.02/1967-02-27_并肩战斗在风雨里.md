Early in the morning, the northwest wind howled, and the rain poured down heavily.

Old Song, a worker at the grain depot, braved the wind and rain, walking with his head held high to the port to check if the incoming grain was properly stacked. He carefully inspected each grain pile, his face occasionally lighting up with excitement and joy. This was the first mission after taking power, how could his heart not be content? Old Song, while inspecting the grain, repeatedly reminded himself: "Now it's our turn, the proletarian revolutionaries, to be in charge. We must shoulder both the revolutionary and production burdens, and make Chairman Mao proud."

Old Song inspected several grain piles. His relaxed brow suddenly furrowed. "Why aren't these grain piles supported with wooden planks? If the rain gets heavier, the grain will get soaked and ruined. We must find a solution quickly!"

He found the port supervisor and asked him to immediately dispatch people to move the grain. To his surprise, the supervisor coldly replied, "We can't spare anyone!" Saying this, he pretended to pick up tools and went to the site to drain the water around the piles.

Old Song was both angry and anxious. The rain showed no sign of stopping, and the state's grain was in danger of being damaged. He quickly called the grain depot revolutionary rebel liaison department and reported the situation. The liaison department's responsible person, upon receiving the call, immediately organized proletarian revolutionary workers to move the grain and also informed the military representative guarding the grain depot.

The military representative, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered a gathering. Standing in the rain, he loudly rallied the soldiers: "Revolutionary soldiers must not let the state's property suffer any loss. Chairman Mao teaches us that the People's Liberation Army should support the leftist masses. The needs of the revolutionary left are our battle orders! Comrades, follow me to the port to rescue the grain!" Saying this, he took the lead, leading the soldiers to bravely face the wind and rain towards the port. As soon as the soldiers arrived, the proletarian revolutionary workers also rushed over. "We must rescue the grain!" People shouted slogans and immediately joined the battle to move the grain.

Model soldier Liu Aifeng was sick, and the rain made his stomach ache. At this moment, he forgot all about his pain, picked up a heavy sack of grain weighing over a hundred pounds, and ran. Platoon leader Li Fenghe noticed that proletarian revolutionary worker Old Zhang, with a limp, was carrying a sack weighing over two hundred pounds, swaying as he walked. Someone beside him advised, "Your leg is not good, don't do it!" Old Zhang firmly said, "If not now, when? Proletarian revolutionaries must act like proletarian revolutionaries!" Li Fenghe was deeply moved by the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary workers taking charge. Without a word, he took the grain sack from Old Zhang and placed it on his own shoulder, walking quickly. The busiest in the crowd was the military representative. Dressed in wet cotton clothes, he carried grain sacks and directed the scene, shouting and encouraging...

These proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought were unyielding, even if the sky fell, they could hold it up, and if the earth sank, they could fill it in. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party wanted to see the proletarian revolutionaries make fools of themselves, but they were just dreaming!

The rain, as if deliberately testing the grain rescuers, poured down even harder. Everyone's cotton clothes were soaked through, heavy and cold. Some people simply took off their cotton clothes, wearing only single layers, running back and forth in the cold wind and rain, carrying grain. The soldiers and proletarian revolutionary workers together sang loudly, "Determine to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The songs and shouts boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary workers and soldiers, and also stirred the hearts of over a hundred deceived port workers. Originally, the port supervisor had concealed the grain emergency, and the workers were unaware. After understanding the truth, they voluntarily came to the port and, together with the proletarian revolutionary workers and soldiers, bravely fought against hunger and cold, and enthusiastically moved the grain.

At two in the afternoon, over twenty thousand pounds of grain threatened by the rain were all rescued. People wiped the rainwater and sweat from their faces, each feeling overjoyed. Only the port supervisor still pretended to be part of the crowd, trying to blend in. The revolutionary workers pulled him out of the crowd, and he said with a gloomy face, "I did not fulfill my responsibility." The revolutionary workers loudly rebuked, "This is not just about not fulfilling responsibility, you intentionally sabotaged the revolutionaries, intentionally sabotaged the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!" A few words left him deflated like a punctured balloon, stammering, "I admit my guilt, I admit my guilt..."

The battle was won. The responsible person of the grain depot revolutionary rebel liaison department excitedly said, "Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to be our strong backing. We must make Chairman Mao proud and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!" The military representative, on behalf of all the soldiers, firmly said, "We, the People's Liberation Army, will forever be the loyal defenders of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Whoever dares to oppose the proletarian revolutionaries, we will fight to the end with them!"

In an instant, shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Salute the People's Liberation Army!" echoed through the sky, like spring thunder rolling, like the Yellow Sea surging with waves.

    并肩战斗在风雨里
    魏文兵　车仓保
    清晨，西北风呼呼地刮，大雨哗哗地下。
    粮库职工老宋，迎着风雨，昂首阔步来到港口码头，检查进港的粮食是不是堆放妥当。他一个粮垛一个粮垛地仔细检查，脸上不时流露出兴奋和喜悦的笑容。这是夺权后第一次执行任务，心里哪能不舒坦啊！老宋一边检查粮食，一边不断嘱咐自己：“现在是咱无产阶级革命派掌权了，可得挑好革命和生产两副重担，为毛主席争气。”
    老宋一连检查了几个粮垛，他那舒展的眉眼忽然结起了疙瘩。“咦，粮垛为什么都没有用木头垫起来？雨再下大，粮食不就泡坏了，得赶紧想办法！”
    他找到了码头主任，要他立刻派人抢运粮食。谁料这位主任冷冷地说：“派不出人呐！”说着，装模作样地拿起工具到现场围垛排水去了。
    老宋又气又急。雨一个劲儿地下，眼看国家的粮食要受损失，他马上打电话把情况报告给粮库革命造反联络部。联络部负责人接到电话，立即组织无产阶级革命派工人抢运，同时，还把情况告诉了保卫粮库的军代表。
    军代表听到了这消息，立即下令集合。他站在雨水里向战士们大声动员：“……革命战士决不能叫国家财产受一点损失。毛主席教导我们，人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。革命左派的需要，就是战斗的命令！同志们，马上跟我上码头抢救粮食！”说罢，一马当先，领着战士们顶风冒雨直奔码头。战士们前脚刚到，无产阶级革命派的工人也赶来了。“一定要把粮食抢出来！”人们高呼着口号，立即投入抢运粮食的战斗。
    五好战士刘爱峰正在生病，雨水一淋，肠胃阵阵发痛，这时，他什么病痛都抛在脑后了，扛起百十斤的大包粮食就跑。班长李奉和发现无产阶级革命派职工老张拐着一条腿，扛着二百多斤的大包，一摇一晃地走着。有人在一旁劝他：“你腿不好，不要干了！”老张坚决地说：“这时候不干，什么时候干？！无产阶级革命派的人就得象无产阶级革命派的样子！”李奉和被无产阶级革命派职工当家作主的革命精神深深激动了，他不由分说，夺过老张的粮包就往自己肩膀上搁，飞快地走了。人群中最忙的还是军代表，他穿着湿棉衣，一边扛粮包，一边指挥现场，喊着鼓动口号……。这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，天塌下来顶得住，地陷下去填得平。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派要看无产阶级革命派的笑话，真是白日做梦！
    雨，象是有意考验抢救粮食的人们，越下越大，大伙的棉衣被雨水淋透了，穿在身上，又冷又沉。有的人干脆脱掉棉衣，只穿单衣，在寒冷的风雨中扛着粮食穿梭地奔跑。指战员们和无产阶级革命派职工一起，高声唱着毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    歌声、呼喊声，鼓舞了无产阶级革命派职工和战士们的干劲，也震动了一百多名受蒙蔽的码头工人的心。原来，那个码头主任把粮食危急的情况封锁了，工人们不知道。明白了事情的真相以后，他们纷纷主动来到码头，和无产阶级革命派职工、解放军战士们一起，不顾饥饿、寒冷，斗志昂扬地抢运粮食。
    下午两点钟，受雨水严重威胁的二十多万斤粮食全部抢救出来了。人们抹拭着脸上的雨水和汗珠，个个心里乐开了花。只有那个码头主任，还装模作样地挤在人群中，想蒙混过去。革命派职工把他从人群中拉了出来，他哭丧着脸说：“我没有负好责任。”革命派职工大声斥责：“这不是一般的不负责任，你是有意拆革命者的台，有意破坏无产阶级文化大革命！”两三句话，说得他活象泄了气的气球，颤着声儿说：“我认罪，我认罪！……”
    战斗胜利了。粮库革命造反联络部负责人激动地说：“毛主席派解放军作我们坚强的后盾，我们一定要为毛主席争气，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”军代表代表全体指战员坚定地说：“我们人民解放军永远是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者，谁敢和无产阶级革命派作对，我们就和他斗争到底！”
    顷时，“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“向解放军学习！”“向解放军致敬！”的欢呼声震天动地，象春雷滚滚，象黄海春潮汹涌澎湃。
