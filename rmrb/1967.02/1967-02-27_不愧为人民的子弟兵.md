	Truly the People's Children

	The Sixth Company of a certain unit stationed in Dàchǎng Huízú Zìzhìxiàn, Hebei Province, immediately organized a discussion after hearing the radio broadcast of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Rural People's Communes, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cadres at All Levels." The broad masses of soldiers and officers unanimously said that Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader of the proletariat, the one who trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and always keeps his heart connected with the revolutionary masses. At this crucial moment of spring plowing, we have once again heard his voice, which speaks to the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary soldiers. He asks us to support and assist in spring plowing production. This is the greatest trust, the greatest care, and the greatest encouragement for us. We enthusiastically support it, resolutely implement it, and fully support the commune in doing a good job in spring plowing production. Liu Guohai, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: "Grasp the revolution, promote production," this is a policy that Chairman Mao has repeatedly emphasized. What attitude we take towards this policy is a matter of principle. We revolutionary soldiers must respond to Chairman Mao's call to battle, help the commune do a good job in spring plowing production, and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	To do a good job in propaganda, the unit quickly compiled and rehearsed the couplets "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" and the Tianjin clapper "The Hearts of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Are the Reddest, Revolutionary Production Leads the Way," and formed an art troupe, a wall newspaper group, and a broadcasting group, and prepared propaganda materials. The next morning, they carried a portrait of Chairman Mao, brought the Party Central Committee's letter written in large characters, and held up a large banner reading "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production, Launch a New High Tide of Spring Plowing," and went to Xiaochang Brigade. They went deep into the streets and fields, wrote blackboard newspapers, posted big-character posters, read the Party Central Committee's letter, performed art programs, and combined labor with propaganda, making Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's voice quickly reach the hearts of the commune's poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels.

	In the labor, the unit displayed a fighting spirit, fearing neither dirt nor hard work. Some comrades continued to dig fertilizer even with blisters on their hands. The commune members said: "The PLA truly deserves to be the people's children taught by Chairman Mao." They also expressed their determination to let Chairman Mao rest assured, vowing to achieve a double victory in revolution and production this year!

    不愧为人民的子弟兵
    驻河北省大厂回族自治县的解放军某部六连，听到电台广播《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》后，立即组织座谈，研究贯彻执行毛主席、党中央最新指示的措施。广大指战员一致说，毛主席是最伟大的无产阶级革命导师，最相信群众，最关心群众，永远和革命群众心连心。在春耕生产的紧要关头，我们又一次听到了他老人家的声音，句句说出了贫下中农和革命战士的心里话。要我们支持、帮助春耕生产，这是对我们最大的信任，最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，我们热烈拥护，坚决贯彻，全力支援公社搞好春耕生产。学习毛主席著作积极分子刘国海说：“抓革命，促生产”，这是毛主席一再强调的方针。对这个方针采取什么态度，这是原则问题。我们革命战士一定要响应毛主席的战斗号召，帮助公社搞好春耕生产，为无产阶级文化大革命做出新贡献。
    为了搞好宣传，部队连夜编排了对口词《抓革命，促生产》，和天津快板《贫下中农心最红，革命生产打先锋》等节目，组成了文艺组，墙报组，广播组，并准备好宣传材料。第二天一早，他们抬着毛主席像，带着抄成大字报的党中央的信，高举“抓革命，促生产，掀起春耕新高潮”的巨幅标语，来到小厂大队。他们深入街头、田间，写黑板报，张贴大字报，读党中央的信，演文艺节目，边劳动边宣传，使毛主席和党中央的声音迅速传到公社贫下中农和各级干部的心里。
    在劳动中，部队发扬了战斗作风，不怕脏，不怕累，有的同志手上打了血泡仍然坚持挖肥。社员们说：“解放军真不愧是毛主席教导出来的人民子弟兵。”并纷纷表示，毛主席这样关怀我们，解放军这样支持我们，搞不好生产对得起谁？我们一定要让毛主席他老人家放心，誓夺今年革命、生产的双胜利！
