The article states: "In Lenin's time, all true Marxists were Marxist-Leninists.

"In the contemporary era, Comrade Mao Zedong has brought Marxism-Leninism to a new height.

"In the contemporary era, all true Marxist-Leninists must master Mao Zedong Thought. Our Comrade Mao Zedong is not only the great teacher of the Chinese revolution but also the great teacher of the world proletarian revolution.
