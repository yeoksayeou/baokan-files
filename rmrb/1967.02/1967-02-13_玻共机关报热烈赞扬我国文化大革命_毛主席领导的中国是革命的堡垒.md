The Bolivian Communist Party's organ, *Liberation Daily*, published an article in the latter half of January that enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought and sternly refuted the slanders of imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism against China's proletarian cultural revolution.

The article pointed out that the proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China is unprecedented in human history. Only under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought can this struggle be waged and victory achieved.

The article emphasized that China will not change its color, "because leading this country is a Marxist-Leninist party led by the greatest revolutionary of our times, Comrade Mao Zedong."

The article severely denounced the collusion of U.S. imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists in distorting China's actual situation. The article said: "China is the most stable and powerful country in the world. ... In the face of seven hundred million Chinese people, the reactionary clique is actually without a foothold. The fact is, the People's Republic of China and its thriving development have made all reactionaries tremble. Today, the People's Republic of China is a bastion of revolution."

The article also exposed the collusion between imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, and Soviet modern revisionists. The article concluded by denouncing those reactionary newspapers that have sold out, saying: "You are liars, you spread lies because you are afraid, afraid of the coming of the revolution."

In the first half of January, *Liberation Daily* also published an article praising the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat in China. The article pointed out that in China, the masses participate in solving various problems, thus "arousing the initiative of the people." Compared to China's democracy, the "democracy" of capitalist countries is "the most shameful deception."

    玻共机关报热烈赞扬我国文化大革命
    毛主席领导的中国是革命的堡垒
    据新华社讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党机关报《解放报》在一月下半月的一期上发表文章，热情赞扬毛泽东思想，并严厉驳斥帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑。
    文章指出，中国正在开展的无产阶级文化大革命是人类历史上没有前例的。只有在毛泽东思想指引下才能开展这场斗争和取得胜利。
    文章强调指出，中国是不会改变颜色的，“因为领导着这个国家的是我们时代最伟大的革命家毛泽东同志领导下的一个马克思列宁主义政党。”
    文章痛斥美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义分子勾结在一起，极力歪曲中国的实际情况。文章说：“中国是世界上最稳定和最强大的国家……。在中国七亿人民面前，反动小集团实际上是无立足之地的。事实是，人民中国及其蓬勃的发展使一切反动派毛骨悚然。”文章说，“人民中国今天是革命的堡垒。”
    文章还揭露了帝国主义者和各国反动派同苏联现代修正主义者狼狈为奸的事实。文章最后斥责那些卖身投靠的反动报刊说：“你们是造谣者，你们撒谎，因为你们害怕，害怕革命的到来。”
    《解放报》在一月上半月的一期上还刊登了一篇赞扬中国无产阶级专政下的大民主的文章。文章指出，在中国，人民群众参与解决各种问题，这样就“唤起了人民的首创精神”。同中国的民主相比，资本主义国家的“民主”是“最可耻的欺骗”。
