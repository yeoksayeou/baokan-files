Under the cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao," the Guanghua Ship triumphantly returns to the motherland. Our third batch of distressed overseas Chinese escape the clutches of the Indonesian reactionaries. Overseas Chinese break through obstacles to send off enthusiastically, forming a powerful demonstration against the Indonesian reactionaries.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 31st, Guanghua Ship: The third batch of 1,070 distressed overseas Chinese from Indonesia returned to the motherland on the 29th of January aboard the Guanghua Ship, departing from the Belawan port in Medan, Indonesia. As the Guanghua Ship slowly left the port, the cheers of "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long Live the Most Beloved and Great Leader Chairman Mao!" along with the powerful song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," echoed through the skies above the Belawan port.

On the 29th, the Belawan port was heavily guarded. The Indonesian military authorities in Medan dispatched a large number of armed soldiers and plainclothes agents to obstruct the hundreds of patriotic overseas Chinese who had come to see them off. They did not allow the overseas Chinese to enter the port and even opened fire to suppress them. However, the overseas Chinese still gathered outside the port and by the port fence, waving handkerchiefs to see off the distressed. Many overseas Chinese, despite the interference of the Indonesian military police, boarded small boats and circled the Guanghua Ship, repeatedly shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" The distressed overseas Chinese on the deck also repeatedly shouted, "Down with American Imperialism!" "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" The enthusiastic send-off on the sea and the shore formed a powerful demonstration against the Indonesian reactionaries.

Many Indonesian friends on the port also continuously waved to the distressed overseas Chinese, who enthusiastically shouted back, "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples!"

This batch of returning distressed overseas Chinese came from more than ten regions in North Sumatra. The majority of them are laborers who have made active contributions to the development and prosperity of Indonesia's national economy. The right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia have subjected them to cruel persecution. Some of their relatives were killed, and some were severely beaten by right-wing thugs. Among the returning distressed overseas Chinese, there are many sick people, with over thirty suffering from tuberculosis. Many people fell ill in the "detention camps" and, due to lack of proper treatment, their conditions worsened. After boarding the Guanghua Ship, they immediately received proper medical treatment and attentive care from the ship's doctors. They expressed their deepest gratitude for the meticulous care shown by the great leader Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland.

The Guanghua Ship's successful evacuation of the third batch of distressed overseas Chinese from Indonesia is the result of a resolute struggle by the Chinese side against the Indonesian right-wing authorities. As with the previous two evacuations, the Indonesian right-wing authorities continued to use violent threats and unreasonable tactics to obstruct and sabotage China's evacuation work. When the Chinese Consul in Medan arrived to arrange for the third evacuation and the Guanghua Ship was about to arrive at Belawan, the Medan military authorities dispatched soldiers and instigated thugs to attack the Chinese Consulate in Medan on the 18th of January, lowering and seizing the Chinese national flag. Subsequently, the Indonesian right-wing authorities violated the evacuation agreement reached by both sides and arbitrarily raised some absurd and unreasonable demands. When the Guanghua Ship arrived at Belawan on the 25th, they blatantly violated international conventions and unreasonably restricted the number of Chinese government evacuation personnel with passports allowed to disembark. The Chinese Consul and evacuation personnel, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fought against these despicable actions of the Indonesian right-wing authorities and ultimately won the struggle.

    在“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声中光华轮胜利返航祖国
    我第三批难侨脱离印尼反动派魔爪
    侨胞们冲破障碍热烈欢送，形成对印尼反动派的强大示威
    据新华社三十一日讯  光华轮消息：第三批回国的印度尼西亚受难华侨一千零七十人，一月二十九日乘光华轮离开印度尼西亚棉兰的勿拉湾码头回国。在光华轮徐徐离开码头的时候，“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”“最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁”的欢呼声和《大海航行靠舵手》的雄壮歌声，响彻勿拉湾码头的上空。
    二十九日，勿拉湾码头上戒备森严。印尼棉兰陆军当局派出的大批武装军警和便衣特务，对赶来送行的数百名爱国侨胞进行了种种阻挠，他们不准侨胞们进入码头，甚至鸣枪镇压。但侨胞们仍然聚集在码头外面和码头栅栏旁边，挥动手巾为难侨们送行。不少侨胞还不顾印尼军警的干涉，乘坐小船围绕着光华轮不断高呼
  “毛主席万岁！”聚集在甲板上的难侨们也不断高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒印尼反动派！”海上和岸上的热烈欢送场面，形成了对印尼反动派的强大示威。
    码头上的不少印尼朋友也不断向难侨挥手致意，难侨们向他们热烈高呼：“中国和印尼人民之间的友谊万岁！”
    这批回国的难侨，来自印尼亚齐的十多个地区，其中绝大部分是劳动人民，对发展和繁荣印尼的民族经济作出过积极的贡献。印尼右派反动势力对他们进行了残酷的迫害，他们有的亲人被杀害，有的被右派暴徒毒打成伤。这次回国的难侨中病人特别多，仅肺病患者就有三十多人。许多人在“收容所”里患病以后，因为得不到应有的治疗，病情不断恶化。他们登上光华轮后，立即受到随船医生的妥善医治和悉心照顾。他们对伟大领袖毛主席和祖国人民无微不至的关怀表示最衷心的感激。
    光华轮这次胜利接运第三批印尼受害华侨回国，是中国方面同印尼右派当局进行了坚决斗争的结果。象前两次接侨一样，印尼右派当局这次继续采取暴力威胁和无理取闹的卑劣手段来阻挠和破坏中国的接侨工作。在中国驻棉兰领事来到棉兰安排第三次接侨工作和光华轮即将抵达勿拉湾的时候，棉兰陆军当局于一月十八日派遣军人并指使暴徒袭击了中国驻棉兰领事馆，降下并劫走了中国国旗。接着，印尼右派当局又违反双方达成的接侨工作协议，节外生枝地提出了一些荒谬无理的要求。在光华轮二十五日到达勿拉湾时，他们又公然违背国际惯例，无理限制持有护照的随船中国政府接侨工作人员的上岸人数。中国领事和接侨工作人员，在毛泽东思想的指引下，对印尼右派当局的这些恶劣行为进行了坚决的斗争，终于取得了斗争的胜利。
