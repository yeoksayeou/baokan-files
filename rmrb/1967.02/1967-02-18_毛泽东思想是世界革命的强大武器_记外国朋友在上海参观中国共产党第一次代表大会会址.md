“Leading our cause is the core force of the Communist Party of China. Guiding our thoughts is the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism.”

All international friends who come to China to seek revolutionary experience want to visit Shanghai to see the great birthplace of the Communist Party of China—the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Every year, tens of thousands of foreign friends come here. Revolutionaries from all over the world, with hearts full of excitement, visit this historically significant site. Some foreign friends, as soon as they step through the memorial hall's door, cannot contain their emotions and excitedly say: “Ah! A great place, the house may be modest, but Comrade Mao Zedong attended the meeting. The blazing flames of the great Chinese revolution started from here.”

Many foreign friends have visited here more than once. A Danish friend visited three times from 1959 to 1966. He said: “Each time I come here, I get new impressions. As a foreigner, I gradually came to understand the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought and the importance of the Party’s ideological construction.” Many foreign guests, during their visits, showed their sincere feelings of admiration and love for Chairman Mao. Once, a Japanese delegation read Chairman Mao’s quotations collectively and sang songs they composed based on Mao’s quotations. A Japanese friend carried a small blackboard with Mao’s quotations written on it during the visit. Thirty-two Vietnamese comrades sang “The East is Red” and “Without Fear of Wind and Waves” collectively after the visit. Members of a French delegation, upon receiving souvenirs with Chairman Mao’s early photos from Chinese staff, were very excited and said: “This is the most precious gift we have received in China.”

	Star of Fire Can Become a Prairie Fire

International friends who come to visit all express in the guestbook or in conversations: visiting this historically significant place has greatly inspired them, strengthened their fighting spirit, and given them hope for revolutionary victory. Chairman Mao’s great strategic thought “a single spark can start a prairie fire” is being understood and grasped by more and more revolutionaries. A Jordanian friend, after the visit, confidently said: “The Chinese revolution, as Chairman Mao said, is like a single spark that can start a prairie fire. Learning from the experience of the Chinese revolution has strengthened my revolutionary faith. I believe that the revolution in my country will definitely be victorious because China gives us strength. Armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely defeat imperialism and revisionism.” Two British friends firmly said: “Believe that the correct minority can develop; otherwise, the first action cannot be taken. From China, we see that Britain also has hope.”

Yes, they think of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China and today’s New China; from the countless sparks of fire in the world today, they look forward to the future world. Therefore, they have a deeper understanding of the great truth “a single spark can start a prairie fire,” and their fighting spirit is strengthened.

	To Make a Revolution, One Must Study Mao Zedong Thought

A Colombian friend said: “The National Liberation Army of Colombia loves Chairman Mao’s works very much. They often say, we do not want clothes, we do not want things, we only want Chairman Mao’s works.”

An Ecuadorian friend said well: “The great thought guiding our actions is Mao Zedong Thought. Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important thing. Anyone who wants to make a revolution must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.” This is a conclusion drawn from revolutionary struggle practice. An Iraqi revolutionary also had the same experience. He said: “Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the proletariat, the strongest and most powerful weapon of the proletariat, and also the strongest and sharpest weapon for the people of colonial and dependent countries to fight. A revolutionary from Spain sincerely told the memorial hall staff: “You introduced that the October Revolution sent Marxism-Leninism to China. We say that the victory of the Chinese revolution sent the truth of Marxism-Leninism to us.” “After returning to the country, we must study Chairman Mao’s works well, not for one or two days, but forever.” Friends from Congo (Leopoldville) said after the visit: “The Communist Party of China is a true party fighting for the liberation of the people, a true revolutionary party. To fight, one must have Mao Zedong Thought. Any action against Mao Zedong Thought is wrong. We can never stop studying Chairman Mao’s works. All revolutionary struggles without Mao Zedong Thought will fail.”

In the guestbook of foreign visitors, one often sees enthusiastic praises for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought: “After returning to the country, I will definitely be a good student of Mao Zedong”; “Chairman Mao is a great teacher and leader. Mao Zedong Thought is the weapon of world revolution. The revolutionary struggles of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must achieve victory, and the most important thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolutionary struggles”; “Our most beloved leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, is the Lenin of our time, and his thought guides the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to victory.”

	Opened the Road to Communism

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great innovation in the international communist movement, shocking the world. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, many foreign visitors here have highly evaluated and praised the great achievements of China’s Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards. A French friend said: “The Communist Party of China, founded by a small number of revolutionaries, has been established for forty-five years. At that time, some people thought it was a laughable thing, but for us, it is an important event that decides the fate of the world. The October Revolution of 1917 fundamentally shook the capitalist world. In 1949, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the victory of the Chinese revolution rang the death knell for world imperialism. Now, the Cultural Revolution in China assures us that revisionism will never seize power in China. The road to communism has been opened! This Cultural Revolution must be carried through to the end. For us French Marxist-Leninists, this is a great encouragement and a precious inspiration.”

The Cultural Revolution in China has made the revolutionary people of the world joyful; it has made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries terrified and restless.

A Jordanian friend enthusiastically said: “The significance of the Cultural Revolution in China is profound. It has inspired the revolutionary people of the whole world. The Cultural Revolution has enriched Marxism-Leninism.”

A Bolivian friend said: “The Cultural Revolution in China has struck at Soviet revisionism and shattered their dream of restoring capitalism in China. The Soviet revisionists hate the Cultural Revolution in China, but the people of the world long for China.”

Foreign visitors often receive a warm welcome from the Red Guards who are visiting at the same time. Foreign friends expressed: being able to meet the Red Guards here has extraordinary significance. Spanish friends enthusiastically praised the Red Guards, saying: “The Red Guards are the vanguard of modern revolution and the example for European youth.”

    毛泽东思想是世界革命的强大武器
    ——记外国朋友在上海参观中国共产党第一次代表大会会址
      “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
    凡是来到中国寻求革命经验的国际友人，都想到上海参观伟大的中国共产党的诞生地——中国共产党第一次代表大会会址。这里每年都要接待成千上万的外国朋友。来自世界各地的革命者，怀着激动的心情，参观这个具有伟大历史意义的会址。有的外国朋友一踏进纪念馆的大门，就抑制不住感情，激动地说：“啊！伟大的地方，房屋虽然简陋，但毛泽东同志出席了大会，伟大的中国革命的燎原烈火，正是从这里开始的。”
    许多外国朋友不止一次地来这里参观。一位丹麦朋友从一九五九年到一九六六年参观了三次。他说：“每到这里一次，都得到新的印象。作为一个外国人，我逐步认识到了毛泽东思想的伟大意义，认识到了党的思想建设的重要性。”许多外宾在参观时，表现出对毛主席无限敬仰和无限热爱的真挚感情。有一次，一个日本代表团在参观时集体朗读毛主席语录并合唱他们自己谱写的毛主席语录歌。有一位日本朋友身上背着写有毛主席语录的小黑板来参观。越南的三十二位同志在参观结束时，集体合唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。法国一个代表团的团员们接到中国工作人员送给他们的印有毛主席早年照片的纪念品，十分激动地说：“这是我们到中国来所接受的最珍贵的礼物。”
          星星之火，可以燎原
    前来参观的国际朋友，都在留言簿上或谈话中表示：参观这个具有历史意义的地方，受到了极大的鼓舞，坚定了斗争的信心，看到了革命胜利的希望。毛主席的伟大战略思想“星星之火，可以燎原”，正在被越来越多的革命者所理解、所掌握。一位约旦朋友在参观后信心十足地说：“中国的革命，正像毛主席讲的是星星之火，可以燎原。学习了中国革命的经验，使我增强了革命的信心。我相信我国革命一定能胜利，因为有中国给我们力量。有伟大的毛泽东思想来武装，我们一定能战胜帝国主义和修正主义。”两位英国朋友很坚定地说：“要相信正确的少数能发展，不然就不能采取第一个行动。从中国看英国，英国也是有希望的。”
    是的，他们从中国共产党第一次代表大会，想到今日的新中国；从现今世界上无数的星星之火，展望未来的世界。因此对“星星之火，可以燎原”这一伟大真理有了更加深刻的体会，斗争信心也随之增强。
        要革命就要学习毛泽东思想
    一位哥伦比亚朋友说：“哥伦比亚的民族解放军非常热爱毛主席著作。他们常说，我们一不要衣，二不要物，只要毛主席著作。”
    一位厄瓜多尔朋友说得好：“指导我们行动的伟大思想是毛泽东思想。学习毛泽东思想是最重要的大事。谁想搞革命就要学习和运用毛泽东思想。”这是从革命斗争的实践中得出的结论。一位伊拉克革命者也有同样的体会。他说：“毛泽东思想是工人阶级的指导思想，是工人阶级唯一的最强有力的武器，也是世界上殖民地和附属国人民进行斗争的最强大的最锐利的武器。”来自西班牙的革命者，非常诚恳地对纪念馆工作人员说：“你们介绍说，十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义。我们说，中国革命的胜利，给我们送来了马列主义真理。”“回国后，我们一定要很好地学习毛主席著作，不是学一天两天，而是永远学。”刚果（利）的朋友们在参观以后说：“中国共产党是真正为人民解放而斗争的，是真正的革命党。要斗争就要有毛泽东思想。任何违背毛泽东思想的行动都是错误的。我们永远不能停止学习毛主席著作，一切革命斗争离开毛泽东思想就要失败。”
    在外宾留言簿上，经常可以看到热情歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想的留言：“回国后一定要做个毛泽东的好学生”；“毛主席是伟大的导师和领袖。毛泽东思想是世界革命的武器。亚非拉的革命斗争要取得胜利，最重要的就是要用毛泽东思想来指导革命斗争”；“我们最敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志是当代的列宁，他的思想引导着亚非拉人民的解放斗争走向胜利”。
        打开了走向共产主义的道路
    中国无产阶级文化大革命是国际共产主义运动中的伟大创举，震动了全世界。自文化大革命开始以来，到这里参观的很多外宾，对我国文化大革命所取得的伟大成就和红卫兵给予了高度的评价和赞扬。一位法国朋友说：“由极少数革命者创建的中国共产党成立以来，已有四十五年了。当时在某些人看来，这是可笑的事情，但对我们说来，这是决定世界命运的重要事件。一九一七年俄国十月革命从根本上震动了资本主义世界。一九四九年在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，中国革命的胜利，则敲响了世界帝国主义的丧钟。现在，中国的文化大革命向我们保证，修正主义永远不会在中国夺得政权。走向共产主义的道路已经打开！这场文化大革命必须进行到底。对我们法国的马列主义者来说，这是巨大的激励和宝贵的鼓舞。”
    中国的文化大革命使世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞；使帝修反惊恐万状，惶惶不可终日。
    一位约旦朋友热情地说：“中国的文化大革命的意义是很深远的。它鼓舞了全世界的革命人民。文化大革命丰富了马列主义。”
    玻利维亚一位朋友说：“中国的文化大革命打击了苏联修正主义，粉碎了他们在中国搞资本主义复辟的梦想。苏修憎恨中国的文化大革命，但世界人民却是向往中国。”
    外宾们经常受到同时参观的红卫兵的热烈欢迎。外国朋友们表示：能在这里遇见红卫兵，具有不平凡的意义。西班牙的朋友热情赞扬红卫兵说：“红卫兵是现代革命的先锋，是欧洲青年的榜样。”
