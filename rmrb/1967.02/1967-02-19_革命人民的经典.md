	Many progressive youth in Africa, either collectively or individually, have obtained through various means the long-awaited "Little Red Book" of Quotations from Chairman Mao.

	One day, a young man from Kenya in East Africa asked a Chinese worker for a copy of the "classic of the people who make revolution," saying, "The classic of the people who make revolution" is the Quotations from Chairman Mao. He had read this red-covered treasure at a friend's place and found that everything Chairman Mao said in the book was the truth of revolution. He and his friends all called the Quotations from Chairman Mao the "classic of the people who make revolution" or the "red classic." He said he urgently wanted to obtain a copy of the Quotations from Chairman Mao and a Chairman Mao badge. When his request was fulfilled, he could not help but say, "Chairman Mao is our great leader."

    革命人民的经典
    许多非洲进步青年，集体或者个人，通过各种途径取得他们久久盼望得到的一本《毛主席语录》。
    一天，东非肯尼亚的一位青年向一位中国工作人员要一本“闹革命的人民的经典”，他说，“闹革命的人民的经典”就是《毛主席语录》。他是在一位朋友那里读过这本红皮宝书的，他发现书中毛主席所说的话全都是革命真理，他和他的朋友们都把《毛主席语录》叫做“闹革命的人民的经典”，或者叫“红色经典”。他说，他迫切要求得到一本《毛主席语录》和一枚毛主席像章。当他的要求得到满足的时候，他情不自禁地说：“毛主席是我们伟大的领袖。”
