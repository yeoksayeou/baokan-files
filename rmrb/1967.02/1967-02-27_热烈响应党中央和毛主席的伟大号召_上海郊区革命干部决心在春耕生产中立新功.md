The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Rural People's Communes, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cadres at All Levels" has received enthusiastic support from cadres at all levels and in all people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai.

	Part of the cadres participating in the "Raising High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production Experience Exchange Pledge Conference" in Shanghai held a symposium. They excitedly shared their thoughts and resolutions, expressing their determination to firmly respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and to work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job in spring production and achieve new merits.

	The cadres present read the letter from the Party Central Committee and enthusiastically shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" A cadre from Cao Wang People's Commune in Jiading County said, "Chairman Mao, though he is in Beijing, knows so much about our rural affairs!" A cadre from Fengxian County said, "From the letter of the Party Central Committee, it can be seen that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have always been concerned about us poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres. This letter timely points out the direction for the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary factions, and cadres."

	A cadre from Shen Zhuang Production Brigade in Liu Xing People's Commune, Baoshan County, said, "In the past, my direction was unclear, and I did not understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leading to many wrong thoughts. After reading this letter, my mind is clear. The letter from the Party Central Committee speaks the words in our hearts, the words of the hearts of the vast number of rural cadres."

	Some cadres who had made mistakes also expressed their determination to firmly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and strive to make amends in spring production. Some cadres had such concerns: We have made mistakes, and now we want to come out and take charge of production. Will the masses trust us? After studying the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, everyone realized that this is a manifestation of the thought of not trusting the masses. A cadre from Chengbei People's Commune in Songjiang County said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary factions are reasonable and will understand and support cadres who have made mistakes but are willing to make amends in spring production."

	The cadres present unanimously expressed their determination to firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words and the Party Central Committee's words, to unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, to implement the hopes raised by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the letter to the cadres, to immediately convene three-level cadre meetings after returning, to seriously seize the revolution and promote production, and to launch the first shot of spring production.

    热烈响应党中央和毛主席的伟大号召
    上海郊区革命干部决心在春耕生产中立新功
    据《解放日报》报道：《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，得到了上海郊区各县、各人民公社干部的热烈拥护。
    正在上海参加“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产经验交流誓师大会”的部分干部举行了座谈会，激动地谈了自己的感想和决心，表示坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，和贫下中农一起，搞好春耕生产，建立新功劳。
    到会干部读完了党中央的信，都激动地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”嘉定县曹王公社一位干部说：“毛主席他老人家虽然住在北京，但是对我们农村的事情，知道得多么清楚啊！”奉贤县一位干部说：“从党中央的信可以看出，毛主席和党中央一直都在关怀着我们贫下中农和农村干部。这封信，给贫下中农、革命派和干部及时地指出了方向。”宝山县刘行公社沈宅大队一位干部说：“过去自己方向不明确，对文化大革命运动不理解，产生许多错误的想法。读了这封信，心中明朗了。党中央的信，说出了我们的心里话，说出了农村广大干部的心里话。”
    参加座谈会的一些犯过错误的干部，都表示坚决响应党中央的号召，要努力在春耕生产中将功补过。有些干部曾有过这样的顾虑：我们曾犯过错误，现在要站出来抓生产，群众信任我们吗？大家学习中共中央的信后，认识到这是不相信群众的思想在作怪。松江县城北公社一干部说：“贫下中农和革命派是通情达理的，对犯过错误但是愿意在春耕生产中将功补过的干部，是会谅解和支持的。”
    到会干部一致表示要坚决听毛主席的话，听党中央的话，和贫下中农结合起来，贯彻执行中共中央在信中向干部提出的希望，回去后立即召开三级干部会议，认真地抓革命，促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮。
