The armed uprising of the Angolan people has been going on for six years. We, the Chinese people and the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the fighting Angolan people, enthusiastically celebrate this day of struggle, "Angola Day."

For centuries, the Angolan people have suffered from the brutal oppression and exploitation of Portuguese colonialism, as well as the imperialism of the United States, Britain, Belgium, and other countries. Five million Angolans have been deprived of all freedoms, and every year, many are taken away to perform slave labor.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance; where the oppression is the heaviest, the resistance is the greatest. On February 4, 1961, the Angolan people rose up in revolt! They took up arms and launched a heroic struggle against the Portuguese colonialists. The Angolan guerrilla fighters, in their struggle, armed their minds with Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They regard Chairman Mao's works as their guide to revolution and struggle. Therefore, they grow stronger with each battle. The armed struggle, which began in 1961, has continued to this day and has expanded from the northern region to the southeastern region. The spark of the Angolan people's armed struggle is gradually spreading into a prairie fire.

The fighting Angolan people and the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have learned from their own fighting experience that this era is one in which the proletariat and oppressed peoples of the world rise up to smash the chains from their necks and liberate themselves! They do not believe in the "benevolence" of U.S. imperialism, nor do they believe in the sweet talk of Portuguese imperialism, nor do they believe in the notorious "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary road" of the Soviet revisionists. They will no longer be fooled by these demons! They understand that hoping for the butcher to lay down his knife and become a Buddha is just a fantasy!

Imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries may seem formidable, but they are all paper tigers. The world's number one bandit, U.S. imperialism, has been beaten into a sorry state by the Vietnamese people; the Portuguese imperialism that has ridden roughshod over the Angolan people has been beaten into a frenzy by the fighting Angolan people. These facts are the most powerful proof.

"The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours." Angola belongs to the Angolan people. Brave Angolan people, fight bravely! The 700 million Chinese people resolutely support you! The Chinese People's Liberation Army resolutely supports you! We will always follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and be ready at any time to join all the oppressed peoples of the world in fighting against imperialism, fighting against modern revisionism, and fighting against the reactionaries of various countries.

Chairman Mao said: "The people of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, be unafraid of difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All the devils will be annihilated." Brave Angolan comrades, let us join hands under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and fight together with the revolutionary people of the whole world to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of various countries, sweep away all the harmful elements, and create a new world that is red all over! Soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

### 安哥拉人民造反必胜

    安哥拉人民造反必胜
    安哥拉人民武装起义已经六周年了。我们中国人民和中国人民解放军战士同战斗的安哥拉人民一起，热烈地庆祝这个战斗的“安哥拉日”。
    几百年来，安哥拉人民遭受葡萄牙殖民主义以及美、英、比等帝国主义的残酷压迫和剥削。五百万安哥拉人民被剥夺了一切自由，每年都有许多人被抓去从事奴隶劳动。
    哪里有压迫，那里就有反抗；哪里压迫最重，那里反抗最大。一九六一年二月四日，安哥拉人民起来造反了！他们拿起武器向葡萄牙殖民主义者展开了英勇的斗争。安哥拉游击战士们在斗争中用毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一英明思想武装自己的头脑，他们把毛主席的著作作为革命、战斗的指南。因而，他们越战越强。武装斗争不仅从一九六一年一直坚持下来，而且由原来的北部地区，扩大到东南部。安哥拉人民武装斗争的星星之火，正在逐步形成燎原之势。
    战斗的安哥拉人民和亚、非、拉广大革命人民，从自己的亲身战斗经验中懂得：当今这个时代，是全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民奋起砸碎脖子上的枷锁，是自己解放自己的时代！他们不相信美帝的“恩赐”，他们不相信葡帝的“好话”，也不相信苏修的什么“和平过渡”、“议会道路”等等臭名远扬的货色。他们不会再上这些牛鬼蛇神的当了！他们懂得，指望杀人魔王“放下屠刀，立地成佛”，只是幻想！
    帝国主义和各国反动派看样子可怕，其实都是纸老虎。世界上头号强盗美帝国主义被越南人民打得狼狈不堪；骑在安哥拉人民头上的葡萄牙帝国主义被战斗的安哥拉人民打得焦头烂额。这些事实就是最有力的证明。
    “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。”安哥拉是安哥拉人民的。英勇的安哥拉人民，勇敢地战斗吧！我们七亿中国人民坚决支持你们！我们中国人民解放军坚决支持你们！我们永远遵循毛主席的伟大教导，发扬无产阶级的国际主义精神，随时准备和全世界一切被压迫人民一道，大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反。
    毛主席说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”英勇的安哥拉战友，让我们在毛泽东思想的指引下携起手来，同全世界革命人民一道，为打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为扫除一切害人虫，为创造出一个红彤彤的新世界而共同战斗吧！中国人民解放军某部战士
