	The Soviet revisionist traitors must be condemned by all.
	Chinese personnel abroad are filled with indignation and denounce the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 31st, the staff of Chinese diplomatic missions in Vietnam, Cambodia, Tunisia, Britain, and Yugoslavia, as well as Chinese students studying abroad, have held demonstrations, meetings, and written letters in recent days to strongly protest the bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe by the Soviet revisionist scoundrels.

	Chinese students studying in Vietnam went to the Soviet Embassy in Vietnam on the 30th to demonstrate and submit a protest letter. They carried banners written in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian that read, "Chinese students in Vietnam strongly protest the bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe by the Soviet revisionist clique." They held red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and placards with slogans such as "Down with the Soviet revisionist clique, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" and marched to the front of the Soviet Embassy in Vietnam. The Soviet embassy staff were terrified and closed the iron gates and windows, hiding inside the building and daring not to face the Chinese students. The Chinese students were filled with indignation and shouted, "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!" "People of the world, unite! Smash U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism!"

	When the Chinese students in Vietnam demonstrated, residents of Vietnam living near the Soviet embassy, as well as Vietnamese workers and cadres passing by, saw the banners held by the Chinese students and the statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 26th, and also looked at the Soviet embassy with angry eyes. A Vietnamese student even shouted, "Long live the Chinese people!"

	All staff members of the Xinhua News Agency's Phnom Penh branch held a meeting on the 31st. The participants pointed out that the Soviet revisionist scoundrels used despicable violence against these Chinese students, which once again thoroughly exposed that they are traitors who have betrayed Lenin, betrayed socialism, betrayed the Soviet people, and betrayed the revolution!

	All staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Tunisia and all experts working in Tunisia held a meeting on the 29th to strongly condemn the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist scoundrels. Finally, the meeting unanimously passed a protest letter condemning the Soviet revisionist scoundrels.

	Chinese students in Britain issued a statement on the 30th pointing out, "This incident once again exposed their fear of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, exposed their traitorous ugly faces, and the true nature of their paper tiger."

	All staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and the Xinhua News Agency's Belgrade branch sent a telegram on the 28th to Chinese students in Europe who suffered from the bloody suppression by the Soviet revisionists, expressing their firm support for their heroic actions, their extreme indignation at the savage fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and their strongest protest.

	The telegram said, Chinese students in Europe have boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and crushed the enemy's arrogance, truly worthy of being students educated by Chairman Mao. The telegram emphasized that the revisionist scoundrels have incurred another blood debt in front of the revolutionary people of the world. Blood debts must be repaid with blood.

    苏修大叛徒　人人共诛之
    我在国外人员义愤填膺怒斥苏修法西斯暴行
    据新华社三十一日讯  我国在越南、柬埔寨、突尼斯、英国、南斯拉夫的驻外机构的工作人员以及留学生连日来纷纷举行示威、集会、写信，对苏修混蛋们对我国留欧学生进行血腥镇压的法西斯暴行，提出了最最强烈的抗议。
    在越南学习的中国留学生，三十日前往苏联驻越南大使馆示威，递交抗议书。他们举着用中、越、俄三种文字书写的“中国留越学生最最强烈抗议苏修统治集团血腥镇压中国留欧学生”的横幅，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和写着“打倒美帝国主义的帮凶苏联修正主义集团！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”等口号的标语牌，来到苏联驻越南大使馆门前。苏联大使馆人员怕得要死，紧闭铁门和窗子，躲在房子里，不敢见中国留学生。中国留学生义愤填膺，他们高呼：“打倒勃列日涅夫！”“打倒柯西金！”“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义和苏联修正主义！”等口号。
    当中国留越学生游行示威时，住在苏修使馆附近的越南居民，以及路过的越南工人、干部，看了中国留学生举着的横幅和当场散发的中国外交部一月二十六日的声明，也以愤怒的目光注视着苏修大使馆。一位越南学生还高呼：“中国人民万岁！”
    新华社金边分社全体工作人员三十一日举行集会。与会者指出，苏修混蛋们以卑鄙的暴力行动来对待这些中国学生，这只是又一次地彻底暴露了，他们是背叛了列宁、背叛了社会主义、背叛了苏联人民和背叛了革命的叛徒！
    中国驻突尼斯大使馆全体工作人员和在突尼斯工作的全体专家，二十九日举行集会，愤怒谴责苏修混蛋们的滔天罪行。最后，大会一致通过了谴责苏修混蛋的抗议书。
    中国留英学生三十日发表声明指出，“这次事件再一次暴露了他们害怕马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想、暴露了他们的叛徒丑恶嘴脸和纸老虎的真面目。”
    中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆和新华社贝尔格莱德分社全体工作人员二十八日打电报给遭受苏修血腥镇压的中国留欧学生，对他们的英雄行为表示坚决支持，对苏联修正主义统治集团的野蛮法西斯暴行表示无比的愤慨，并提出了最最强烈的抗议。
    电报说，中国留欧学生长了革命人民的志气，灭了敌人的威风，不愧为毛主席教导出来的好学生。电报强调指出，修正主义混蛋们在世界革命人民面前又欠下了一笔血债。血债一定要用血来还。
