On the 22nd, we heard from the radio the letter from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres, calling on the poor and lower-middle peasants to seriously "grasp revolution and promote production," and to immediately mobilize and do a good job in spring plowing. Every word in this letter has touched our hearts. This is the greatest trust that Chairman Mao has placed in the poor and lower-middle peasants. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, must shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. Doing a good job in production is not just a matter for a production brigade or a commune; it is a matter of national preparedness for war and famine, and of supporting world revolution.

Spring plowing is a crucial link in agricultural production. If you don't plant in the spring, you won't harvest in the autumn. The success or failure of a year's harvest depends on how well the spring plowing is done. Since the Cultural Revolution began, our brigade has not neglected production, and we have always put the study of Chairman Mao's works first. Everyone goes to the fields every day and studies a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations. The more we study, the clearer our minds become, and the brighter our eyes become. Truly, "standing in Xiaojiahe, we see the whole world." Everyone's enthusiasm for revolution and production is increasing. The manure that needs to be transported to the fields has already been delivered half of it. Eighty percent of the seedlings for the six hundred mu vegetable garden have sprouted, and they are growing well. More than two hundred mu of wheat has been pressed for moisture conservation. The paddy fields have been leveled, and nine walking tractors have been repaired. Half of the dozens of electric pumps have also been repaired. Now, male and female laborers are fertilizing and transporting fertilizer, and building small-scale water conservancy projects. Many laborers are also reclaiming wasteland to turn it into orchards.

In the past, our brigade mainly grew vegetables and always ate state-supplied grain. Last year, not only did we not eat state-supplied grain, but we also sold six ten-thousand jin of grain to the state. This year, we will further carry forward the Daqiaozhuang spirit, follow the Daqiaozhuang road, and do an even better job in production, producing more grain and vegetables to support socialist construction.

Chairman Mao, rest assured. Whatever you say, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will do. We will definitely follow your words and act according to your instructions, carrying out the Cultural Revolution in the countryside on one hand, and taking immediate action on the other to fire the first shot for spring plowing production!

    毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干！
    二十二日，俺们从广播里听到了党中央、毛主席给贫下中农和农村各级干部的信，号召贫下中农认真地“抓革命，促生产”，立即动员起来，搞好春耕生产。这封信的每一句话，都说到了俺们的心坎上。这是毛主席他老人家对贫下中农最大的信任，俺们贫下中农一定要挑起革命和生产两副担子。搞好生产，不仅是关系到一个大队、一个公社的事，而且是关系到国家备战、备荒，关系到支援世界革命的大事。
    春耕生产是农业生产中一个最关紧要的环节。春不种，秋不收。一年收成的好坏，就看春耕生产搞得咋样。俺们大队从文化大革命开始，生产压根儿没有放弃，还把学习毛主席著作放在第一位。大伙每天下地，都要学习一段毛主席语录。大伙越学习，心越明，眼越亮，真是“站在肖家河，看到全世界”。大伙干革命、搞生产的劲头，越来越足。应该往地里运的粪，现在已经送了一半。六百亩菜园的秧苗，已出来百分之八十，长势挺好。一千亩小麦，压麦保墒已经压了二百多亩。稻地已经平整，九台手扶拖拉机已经检修，几十台电泵也修了一半。现在，男女劳力正在积肥、运肥，兴修小型水利。还有不少劳力正在开荒，要把荒山变成果园。
    过去，我们这个队是种蔬菜为主，每年都吃国家的供应粮。去年不但没吃国家的供应粮，还卖给国家六万斤粮食。今年，我们要进一步发扬大寨精神，走大寨之路，把生产搞得更好，生产更多的粮食和蔬菜，支援社会主义建设。
    毛主席啊，您老人家放心吧。您怎么说，俺们贫下中农就怎么干。一定听您的话，按您的指示办事，一面搞好农村中的文化大革命，一面立即行动起来，打响春耕生产第一炮！
