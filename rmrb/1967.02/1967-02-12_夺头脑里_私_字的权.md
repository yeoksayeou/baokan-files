All revolutionary organizations of the proletariat are currently engaged in a two-front struggle for power. On one hand, they are implementing the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power from the capitalist roaders in power. On the other hand, they are seizing the power of the "self" from the minds of the revolutionaries. The former is the general direction of the movement, while the latter is a prerequisite for the great alliance of the revolutionary forces and the most important guarantee for seizing and holding power properly. This great struggle for power on both fronts is excellent!

The great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries will inevitably encounter resistance. Where does this resistance come from? The main resistance comes from the capitalist roaders in power and the stubborn elements who insist on the reactionary bourgeois line. Seeing their own doom approaching, they will certainly fight to the death with tenfold effort against us. Resistance also comes from the old social habits. We still bear the influence and remnants of the old society and old ideas. Within our revolutionary ranks, there are bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies. In our minds, proletarian thought has not yet completely seized the power of the "self"! This is the poison that corrupts our body, hindering our great alliance and seizure of power.

In revolutionary times, especially at critical moments, revolutionaries must dare to search and seize the "self" from their own minds. Otherwise, it will bring irreparable losses to the revolution, even leading to the failure of the entire revolution.

At this crucial moment of the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries, if the revolutionary rebels do not stand up, that is right-opportunism, that is betraying the revolution; and if the revolutionary rebels do not break with the "self" to establish the "public," if they do not completely seize the power of the "self," allowing liberalism, anarchism, factionalism, cliquism, and the like to emerge, then our forces will lose their fighting spirit, the organization will disintegrate, and countless obstacles will be set for the urgent great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, ultimately leading to the failure of the revolution.

In the struggle for power, if the revolutionary forces do not eliminate the poison of the "self," it will weaken our revolutionary spirit. Revolutionary pioneers may degenerate into political mediocrities who seek to preserve their names and benefits, even sliding to the edge of counter-revolution.

In the struggle for power, if the "self" is allowed to act freely, it is easy to lose direction, be used by the enemy, fall into the enemy's trap of sowing discord, causing pain to friends and joy to enemies.

In the struggle for power, if the "self" is not fought against resolutely, it is impossible to distinguish right from wrong, to truly act from the fundamental interests of the proletariat, and to be blinded by small factions, losing principles, not paying attention to investigation and research, and not conducting class analysis. Those who flatter themselves are all labeled as leftists and allied with, while those who have different opinions are all seen as "conservatives" and attacked. The result is that the real conservatives may fish in troubled waters, and the power is not truly in the hands of the revolutionary leftists.

After the proletarian revolutionaries seize power, if they do not resolutely fight on the ideological front to seize the "public" from the "self," then even if power is seized, it may be lost again.

Only when proletarian thought firmly holds power in the minds of the revolutionary rebels can the party power, political power, economic power, and cultural power we hold truly, completely, and thoroughly represent the interests of the proletariat and serve the interests of the proletariat. Otherwise, we will not be able to broaden our vision to see the future, we will not be able to thoroughly smash the bourgeois dictatorship apparatus controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, we will not be able to create a new, vibrant, and Paris Commune-style government that adapts to our socialist economic base. We may become kings who seek fame, indulging in a little success, ultimately making the revolution half-hearted.

Only when proletarian thought seizes the power of the "self" in our minds will we not be deceived by the enemy's flattery, not be hit by the enemy's sugar-coated bullets, and we will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, never change, and forever maintain our revolutionary youth.

The lesson of the Soviet Communist Party leadership's degeneration into revisionism, the 17-year history of class struggle in our country, and the entire international experience of the proletarian dictatorship tell us: the fortress is most easily breached from within. Class enemies always try to find their agents within our ranks. They use all means, pulling out and pushing in, using both soft and hard tactics, flattering and feasting, all to corrupt our souls, to wage a struggle for power in the depths of our souls. Once the bourgeois plot succeeds, a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration is inevitable, the Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the entire China will change color. Waging a struggle for power in our minds is a major issue that relates to the success or failure of the Cultural Revolution, the future of the Chinese revolution, and the fate of revolutionary people around the world!

"When the tree wants to be still, the wind does not stop." Class struggle runs through the entire socialist historical period. Existence determines consciousness, and class struggle in our ranks and in our minds must be reflected. It is either the proletariat seizing power and seizing the power of bourgeois thought, or bourgeois thought seizing the power of proletarian thought, and the bourgeois seizing power. It is either one or the other, and one of the two must prevail.

In the current great struggle for power, there are comrades who do not act from the fundamental interests of the proletariat but are concerned with the name of their small group. Although they have seized the party, political, economic, and cultural powers, they do not know that it is still the "self" that holds power in their minds. To such comrades, we must shout, "Comrade, beware!"

Seizing the power of the "self" in the subjective world is a difficult and painful task. Only in the great waves of class struggle for power in society, by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, daring to engage in self-criticism, daring to expose contradictions, daring to fight to the death, being humble, cautious, guarding against arrogance and impatience, not relying on past merits, not seeking fame and profit, not showing off, not seeking attention, and in the process of integrating with the workers and peasants, undergoing long-term tempering and forging, can we firmly plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, making proletarian thought firmly hold power in our minds, and cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of communism. This is a great cause for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years.

Comrade Lin Biao calls on us: We must let hundreds of millions of people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society, and let this great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought become a great material force!

Breaking with the "self" to establish the "public," uprooting bourgeois thought, and firmly planting the boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the task of the proletarian cultural revolution. We must remember Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, use Mao Zedong Thought as the compass, and bravely wage the great struggle for power on both fronts, rectify our ranks, and form a vast army of proletarian cultural revolutionaries, smashing the old world and creating a new world.

    夺头脑里“私”字的权
    良石
    现在，所有无产阶级革命派组织都在进行着两条战线的夺权斗争，即一方面实行无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路的当权派的权；另一方面，是夺革命派自己头脑中“私”字的权。前者是运动的大方向，后者则是革命派队伍大联合的前提，是夺好权、掌好权的最重要保证。这两条战线上的大夺权好得很！
    无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权势必会遇到阻力。阻力来自何方？阻力主要来自走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。他们看到了自己末日的到来，必然要以“十倍的努力”同我们作拚死的斗争。阻力还来自旧的社会习惯势力。我们身上还有旧社会、旧思想的影响和残余，在我们革命派队伍中存在着资产阶级和小资产阶级的思潮。在我们头脑里，无产阶级思想还没有彻底夺“私”字的权！这是腐蚀我们肌体的毒素，它妨碍着我们大联合、大夺权。
    在革命时期尤其是革命的紧要关头，革命者必须勇于抄自己头脑中“私”字的家，夺“私”字的权。否则就会给革命带来不可弥补的损失，甚至会断送整个革命。
    在目前无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的关键时刻，革命造反派不挺身而出，那就是右倾机会主义，就是背叛革命；而革命造反派不破“私”立“公”，不彻底夺“私”字的权，让自由主义、无政府主义、山头主义、宗派主义等等一齐出笼，那么我们的队伍就会斗志衰退，组织涣散，给刻不容缓的无产阶级革命派大联合设下层层障碍，最后导致革命失败。
    在夺权中，革命派若不清除“私”字的霉毒，它就会削弱我们的造反精神，革命的闯将就可能堕落为保名保利的政治庸人，甚至会滑到反革命的边缘。
    在夺权斗争中，若任“私”字发作，就很容易迷失方向，被敌人所利用，中了敌人挑拨离间的奸计，使亲者痛，仇者快。
    在夺权中，若不狠斗“私”字，就分不清大是大非，就不可能真正从无产阶级根本利益出发，就会被小山头遮住视线，于是丧失原则，不注重调查研究，不作阶级分析。凡吹捧自己者，都封为左派而联合之，凡与自己意见有不同者，皆视为“保字派”而打击之。其结果，很可能真正的保字派混水摸鱼，大权没有真正掌握在革命左派手里。
    无产阶级革命派夺权之后，如果不坚决地在思想阵地上展开以“公”夺“私”的斗争，那么即使夺了权，也会得而复失。
    只有在革命造反派的头脑中无产阶级思想牢牢地掌握了大权，我们所掌握的党权、政权、财权和文化大权才能真正地、完全地、彻底地代表着无产阶级的利益，为无产阶级利益服务。反之，我们就不可能放开眼界看未来，就不能彻底砸烂一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派所把持的资产阶级专政机构，就不可能创造出崭新的，具有生命力的，适应我们社会主义经济基础的巴黎公社式的政权，我们就可能成为沽名的霸王，贪恋于眼前的一点成绩，最后使革命半途而废。
    只有无产阶级思想在我们的头脑中夺了“私”字的权，我们才不会被敌人的“捧场”所迷惑，不为敌人的糖衣炮弹所打中，才能永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永不变质，永葆其革命之青春。
    苏共领导集团堕落为修正主义的教训，我国十七年来阶级斗争的历史，以及整个国际无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们：堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。阶级敌人总是千方百计地在我们的队伍里寻找他们的代理人。他们用尽十八般武艺，拉出去，打进来，软硬兼施，吹吹拍拍，吃吃喝喝，一句话，就是要腐蚀我们的灵魂，就是在我们的灵魂深处搞夺权斗争。一旦资产阶级阴谋得逞，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。在我们的头脑中展开夺权斗争，这是关系到文化大革命的成败，关系到中国革命的前途，关系到全世界革命人民命运的大事！
      “树欲静而风不止。”阶级斗争贯穿整个社会主义历史时期。存在决定意识，阶级斗争在我们队伍中，在我们思想里必然有所反映，不是无产阶级专了政，夺了资产阶级思想的权，就是资产阶级思想夺了无产阶级思想的权，资产阶级专了政。非此即彼，二者必居其一。
    在当前的大夺权斗争中，就有这样的同志，他们不是从无产阶级根本利益出发，而是斤斤计较于自己小团体的名号。他们虽然夺了党、政、财、文权，殊不知脑袋里还是“私”字在掌权。对这样的同志要大喝一声“同志，危险啊！”
    在主观世界里夺“私”字的权是件艰苦的事，痛苦的事。只有在社会上大夺权的阶级斗争风浪中，活学活用毛主席著作，勇于自我批评，勇于暴露矛盾，敢于刺刀见红，谦虚、谨慎、戒骄、戒躁，不吃老本，不图名利，不讲排场，不耍风头，在和工农结合的过程中，长期摔打磨炼，才能使我们头脑中牢牢地插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，使无产阶级思想在我们的头脑中掌稳大权，把自己培养成共产主义真正可靠的接班人。这是革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    林彪同志号召我们：我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！
    破私立公，把资产阶级思想连根拔掉，牢牢栽上光焰无际的毛泽东思想的根子，这是无产阶级文化大革命的任务。我们要牢记林彪同志的教导，用毛泽东思想作指针，勇敢地进行两个战线上的大夺权，整顿好我们的队伍，组成一支千千万万、浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，砸烂旧世界，创造新世界。
