In order to better propagate the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, our agency is soliciting copies of newspapers published by revolutionary rebel groups nationwide. We hope that comrades from the revolutionary rebel groups will actively assist us and promptly send ten copies of each issue of your newspapers to the Xinhua News Agency.
