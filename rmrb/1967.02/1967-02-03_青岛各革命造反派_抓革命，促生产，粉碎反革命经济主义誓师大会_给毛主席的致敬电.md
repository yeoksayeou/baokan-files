The workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres of Qingdao City, Shandong Province, solemnly held a rally to seize the revolution and promote production, smash counter-revolutionary economism on January 29. The rally sent a telegram of respect to the most respected and beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

We, the revolutionary rebels of Qingdao City, who are deeply reverent, infinitely respectful, and forever loyal to you, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolution salute to you, the reddest red sun in our hearts!

Today, we, the revolutionary rebels of Qingdao City, held the "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production, Smash Counter-Revolutionary Economism" rally. With hearts full of excitement, we report to you, dear Chairman: Under your dear care and the correct guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, the revolutionary forces of Qingdao City have continued to grow and develop, and the situation is getting better and better! The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are becoming more and more stinky, like rats crossing the street, everyone wants to beat them. Their crazy counter-revolutionary counterattacks against the revolutionary rebel committees and our proletarian revolutionary rebels have been smashed. In this fierce struggle of seizing power and counter-seizing power, their ugly reactionary faces and political ambitions have been increasingly exposed to the broad revolutionary masses, and their tricks and deceits have been one by one exposed by the revolutionary masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao City, like in other parts of the country, has broken through countless waves and surged over layers of reefs and shoals, overcoming all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, sailing along the course opened by you, breaking waves and forging ahead!

"Seize the revolution and promote production" is your great call, and "to save on expenses and make revolution" is your latest instruction. We will be your good students and good soldiers. We will definitely follow your words one hundred percent and act according to your instructions one hundred percent. However, it is infuriating that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, when the situation is unfavorable to them, suddenly made a one hundred and eighty-degree turn. They raised the banner of "satisfying the material needs of the rebels as much as possible." They attempt to use economic benefits and material incentives as bait to win over and corrupt our revolutionary ranks, to undermine the fighting strength of the revolutionary rebels, and to lead this serious political struggle onto the counter-revolutionary economism path. They maliciously want to destroy our socialist country and our proletarian dictatorship, which is extremely evil! After we seized their power, they adopted the vicious tactic of washing their hands and being lazy, wanting to see our jokes. Recently, they have put forward extremely reactionary slogans, using the so-called "sparrow tactics," foolishly hoping to "surround the cities from the countryside," waiting for a comeback, attempting to strangle our newly born new regime, which is laughable to the extreme! This is another counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line against us. But these fools are simply blind! Who owns Qingdao today? We do! We do! We, the proletarian revolutionary rebels, not only have the courage to smash an old world but also know how to build a bright red new world! We dare to seize power, and we are even better at holding power! Let those bourgeois lords and bastards all go to hell! We want to be the masters of our own house. If the sky falls, we will prop it up; if the earth sinks, we will fill it in! We are the proletarian revolutionary rebels who stand tall and firm. We have never believed in those bourgeois lords. To be liberated, we rely on ourselves! We will definitely follow your teaching of "seize the revolution and promote production," actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly expose the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink! We will completely, thoroughly, and cleanly dig out all the time bombs hidden within the Party, not leaving a single one! At the same time, we will take the lead in promoting production. We will be both the vanguard of the revolution and the model of production. We, the revolutionary rebels, will firmly guard our production posts, strive to overfulfill the state plan, and achieve double victories in revolution and production! We will definitely follow your latest instruction of "to save on expenses and make revolution," carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, and crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. White terror has not shaken our resolve to revolt, and sugar-coated bullets will never defeat us. Who wants their stinking money? We want socialism and communism! We want a new China and a new world with Mao Zedong Thought red flags flying everywhere! "The world belongs to us. The country belongs to us. The society belongs to us. If we do not say it, who will say it? If we do not do it, who will do it?" The proletarian helm, if we do not hold it, who will hold it? We are the masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we are the masters of the new socialist China! Chairman Mao, rest assured! We have the courage to seize this power, and we definitely have the resolve to hold this power firmly. Whoever wants to seize this power back from our hands, it is harder than climbing to the sky!

Most respected Chairman Mao: We swear to you: We will read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions for life. We will follow you in the great waves of class struggle for life. To defeat the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, to thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, to consolidate our revolutionary rebel committee's red power, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to achieve double victories in revolution and production, we are willing to sacrifice everything, even our lives, and we will not rest until our goal is achieved! "By the wrecked boat, a thousand sails pass; before the withered tree, ten thousand flowers bloom." All the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, all the ghosts and monsters, all the bourgeois lords, go to hell! A brand-new, bright red Qingdao, shining with the boundless rays of Mao Zedong Thought, is right before our eyes! Let us raise our arms high and welcome her!

Finally, let us sincerely wish you, the reddest red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!! Eternal life!!!

    最最敬爱的毛主席：我们向您老人家宣誓：一定要一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，一辈子跟着您在阶级斗争的大风浪中奋勇前进。为了打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，为了彻底粉碎反革命经济主义，为了巩固我们革命造反委员会的红色政权，为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为了夺取革命、生产双胜利，我们宁愿献出自己的一切，甚至生命，不达目的，死不瞑目！“沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春”。一切党内走资本主义道路的当权派，一切牛鬼蛇神，一切资产阶级老爷们，统统见鬼去吧！一个崭新的红彤彤的闪烁着毛泽东思想万丈光芒的新青岛就在眼前！让我们高高地举起双臂欢呼她的到来吧！
      最后，让我们衷心地祝愿您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！万寿无疆！！！
