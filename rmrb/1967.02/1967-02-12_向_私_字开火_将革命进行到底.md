The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ultimately boils down to a struggle for power. The revolutionary rebels aim to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and firmly grasp it in their own hands. To seize power, the key lies in the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels. Without great unity, rushing to seize power would be reckless. Even if some power is seized, it could still be lost. Chairman Mao teaches us: "... What force is the strongest? The force of the united masses is the strongest. 'Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army,' this is the need of today's revolution to launch an offensive against counter-revolutionaries." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has developed to this day, and the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels is even more necessary for us to launch a comprehensive offensive and seizure of power against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

However, the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels currently faces some obstacles. Every true revolutionary comrade should reflect on this:

Who is it that is sabotaging the great unity of the revolutionary rebels?

Chairman Mao often teaches us to look at problems from a class standpoint and not to be confused by complex surface phenomena.

It is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the few stubborn diehards who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, who are terrified and hateful of our great unity and seizure of power, secretly gnashing their teeth and sharpening their knives. As Lenin said, "they will fight with tenfold effort, with frenzied zeal, and with hatred increased a hundredfold to restore their 'paradise' that has been taken from them." They collude with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, deceive the masses, and use every possible means to sabotage the great unity of the revolutionary rebels. This is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines, a new form of the bourgeois reactionary line. At the critical moment of the proletarian revolutionary rebels seizing power, at the crucial juncture of the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the enemy always attempts to break through the revolutionary rebel camp from within, causing the revolutionary rebels to split, and making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution stillborn. We warn these bastards: you are dreaming in broad daylight, harboring delusions! We revolutionary rebels will not fall for your tricks! True revolutionary rebels must unite closely on the principle of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, unite all forces that can be united, form a vast cultural revolutionary army, and march forward bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao said: "A party that wants to lead the revolution to victory must rely on the correctness of its political line and the consolidation of its organization. 'The Communist Party within the Fourth Red Army exists with various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the execution of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly corrected, then the great revolutionary struggle of China will not be able to be undertaken by the Fourth Red Army.'"

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has developed to this day, and the task of seizing great power and building a completely new type of leadership organ has fallen on the shoulders of the revolutionary rebels. Without a revolutionary rebel force that is highly proletarianized and combat-ready in both organization and ideology, this great historical mission cannot be accomplished. Therefore, it has become an urgent task to enhance the proletarian revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of our revolutionary rebel forces. This is an important guarantee for carrying the revolution through to the end.

Localism, factionalism, separatism, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, liberalism, subjectivism, individualism, cliquism, hilltopism, and windism that exist within the revolutionary rebels are all manifestations of the bourgeois worldview, reflections of the sharp class struggle within the revolutionary ranks, major obstacles to the great unity of the revolutionary left, and incompatible with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line requires us to unite and organize the broad masses under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought to complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The aforementioned thoughts, however, advocate doing things independently, striking out in all directions, letting things go, and being a loose collection of individuals, turning the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat into bourgeois liberalization and anarchism, prioritizing the interests of one's own organization and personal interests over the overall interests of the revolution. This perfectly suits the enemy's needs. Revolutionary rebels must thoroughly break with all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts.

All thoughts that are incompatible with the proletarian revolutionary line ultimately boil down to one thing: putting the "self" first and the "private" in command. With the "private" in command, it is impossible to properly handle the relationship between the individual and the masses, and between the individual and the collective. If we do not launch an attack on the "private," then no matter how correct or how many merits one has in the past, it is impossible to implement the proletarian revolutionary line and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line; it is only possible to lose the support of the masses and lose "power," causing the revolution to suffer setbacks. Therefore, we must seriously deal with these issues and thoroughly defeat them. The current situation is such that if you do not revolutionize, others will overthrow you!

Comrade Lin Biao said, "The great democracy of the proletariat 'must be thoroughly implemented not only between the leadership and the masses but also among the masses and among the masses themselves. Among the masses, without such great democracy, without being good at consulting with each other, without being good at listening to different opinions, without being good at presenting facts and reasoning, without being good at thinking and solving problems, it is impossible to educate oneself and liberate oneself, it is impossible to achieve the goal of developing the leftist forces, uniting the majority, and isolating a handful of bourgeois rightists, it is impossible to fully implement the line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao."

However, in some organizations, some self-proclaimed executors of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are extremely afraid of rectification within the revolutionary rebel ranks and extremely afraid of criticism, and they never conduct serious self-criticism. As soon as someone criticizes them, they jump up as if they have been electrocuted. We cannot help but ask: why are you so afraid of the masses and criticism? Is it really that "the tiger's buttocks cannot be touched"? We must touch them! Let people speak, the sky will not fall, and you will not collapse; if you do not let people speak, you will collapse one day!

Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought," "Opposing Liberalism," and "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," are powerful weapons for us to fight the ideological battle. All revolutionary comrades must link their thoughts and practical struggles, bring their problems, and actively learn and apply them, touching their souls and transforming their worldviews. We must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, through rectification, truly build our combat organizations into highly proletarianized and combat-ready revolutionary leftist forces, temper our combat forces in the great storms of class struggle, consolidate the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary left, and seize one great victory after another.

Long live the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels!

    向“私”字开火　将革命进行到底
    北航“红旗”驻沪联络站
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级文化大革命归根结底就是一场夺权斗争。革命造反派就是要从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手中把权夺过来，牢牢地掌握在自己的手中。要夺权，关键在于无产阶级革命造反派的大联合。没有大联合，匆匆忙忙跑去夺权，那就是妄动。即使夺回了一些权，也还会丧失。毛主席教导我们说：“……什么力量最强？民众联合的力量最强。”“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”文化大革命发展到了今天，无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，更是我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开全面的大进攻、大夺权的需要。
    但是，当前无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，遇到了一些障碍。每个真正的革命同志都应该联系起来想一想：
    究竟是谁在破坏革命造反派的大联合？
    毛主席经常教导我们要用阶级观点来看问题，切不要被复杂的表面现象所迷惑。
    是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏家伙，是他们对我们的大联合、大夺权怕得要死，恨得要命，暗地里咬牙切齿，擦刀磨剑，他们正如列宁说的那样，“以十倍的努力、疯狂的热情、百倍增长的仇恨来拚命斗争，想恢复他们被夺去的‘天堂’”。他们勾结了社会上的地、富、反、坏、右，欺骗群众，千方百计地破坏革命造反派的大联合。这是两条路线斗争的继续，是资产阶级反动路线的新形式。在无产阶级革命派夺权的关键时刻，在无产阶级和资产阶级生死搏斗的紧要关头，敌人总是企图从内部攻破革命造反派阵营，造成革命造反派的四分五裂，使得无产阶级文化大革命夭折。我们要警告这批混蛋们：你们这是白日作梦，痴心妄想！我们革命造反派决不会上你们的当！真正的革命造反派一定要在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的原则基础上紧密地联合起来，团结一切可以团结的力量，组成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！
    毛主席说：“一个政党要引导革命到胜利，必须依靠自己政治路线的正确和组织上的巩固。”“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”
    无产阶级文化大革命发展到了今天，夺取大权，建设一个完全新型的领导机构的重担落到革命造反派的肩上了。没有一个在组织上思想上非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命造反派队伍，是不能完成这个伟大的历史使命的。因此，提高我们革命造反派队伍的无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性已经成为迫在眉睫的任务了。这是将革命进行到底的重要保证。
    革命造反派内部存在着的本位主义、小团体主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、自由主义、主观主义、个人主义、宗派主义、山头主义、风头主义等等，都是资产阶级世界观的表现，是当前尖锐的阶级斗争在革命队伍内部的反映，是革命左派大联合的大敌，是和毛主席的革命路线水火不相容的。毛主席的革命路线要求我们在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，把广大群众紧紧地团结起来，组织起来，去完成一斗、二批、三改的伟大任务。而上述思想却主张各行其是，东打一拳，西踢一脚，放任自流，一盘散沙，把无产阶级专政下的大民主变成资产阶级的自由化和无政府主义，不是革命大局的利益第一，而是自己的组织利益第一，个人利益第一。这正好符合敌人的需要。革命造反派一定要和种种资产阶级、小资产阶级思想彻底决裂。
    一切同无产阶级革命路线水火不相容的思想，归根到底，不是别的，就是“我”字当头，“私”字挂帅。有了“私”字，就无法摆正个人和群众的关系，无法摆正个人和集体的关系。如果不向“私”字开火，那就不管你过去多么正确，有多大功劳，也根本谈不上贯彻无产阶级革命路线，根本谈不上彻底批判资产阶级反动路线；那就只有失去群众，失去“权”，使革命受到挫折。因此必须认真对付，彻底把它们打倒。现在的形势就是这样：如果你不革命，别人就要革你的命！
    林彪同志说，无产阶级大民主“不但领导和群众之间必须彻底实行，而且，在群众中，在群众相互之间，也完全必须彻底实行。在群众之间，没有这样的大民主，不善于互相商量，不善于倾听不同的意见，不善于摆事实讲道理，不善于开动脑筋，思考问题，这样，就不可能自己教育自己，自己解放自己，就不可能达到发展左派队伍，团结大多数，孤立一小撮资产阶级右派的目的，就不可能不折不扣地实行我们伟大导师毛主席所提出的无产阶级文化大革命的路线。”
    但是，在有些组织中，有些自称执行毛主席的革命路线的负责人，非常害怕革命造反派内部整风，非常害怕别人批评，自己也从不作认真的自我批评。别人一批评，他们就象触了电似的跳起来。我们不禁要问：你们为什么如此怕群众、怕批评呢？难道真是“老虎屁股摸不得”吗？偏要摸！让人家讲话，天不会塌下来，自己也不会垮台；不让人家讲话，那就总有一天要垮台！
    毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》三篇光辉著作是我们打好思想仗的强大武器。一切革命同志都要联系自己的思想，联系斗争实践，带着问题，活学活用，触及自己的灵魂，改造自己的世界观。我们要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，通过整风，把战斗组织真正建设成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命左派队伍，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中把战斗队锻炼得更坚强，巩固无产阶级革命左派的大联合，去夺取一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    无产阶级革命造反派大联合万岁！
