The spring of revolutionary rebellion has arrived! The spring of revolutionary rebellion has arrived! The spring of revolutionary rebellion has arrived! The winds roar, the banners wave, and Chairman Mao has issued the call to battle. The proletarian revolutionary factions should unite and overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road! The People's Liberation Army should support and assist the leftists in their rebellion. Look! The ranks of the revolutionary rebels have surged forward like a mighty spring tide, sweeping away all the rotten branches and dead leaves! Listen! The revolutionary rebels have sounded the call for great unity. All guns are aimed at the enemy's lair! The revolutionary tide is irresistible, and the reactionary line has collapsed completely! The spring of revolutionary rebellion has arrived! Let us raise our hands high and cheer: The brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought—like the spring sun—illuminate the entire globe!
