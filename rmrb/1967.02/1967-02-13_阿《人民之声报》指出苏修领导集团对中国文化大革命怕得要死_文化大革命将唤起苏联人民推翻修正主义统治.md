Albanian "People's Voice" Newspaper Points Out the Soviet Revisionist Leadership's Fear of China's Cultural Revolution

The Cultural Revolution Will Arouse the Soviet People to Overthrow the Revisionist Regime

The Spread of Mao Zedong Thought Cannot Be Blocked; the More the Enemy Attacks, the More It Shows Its Power

The Soviet People Will One Day Settle Accounts with the Soviet Revisionist Leadership and Restore the Great Achievements of the October Revolution

New China News Agency, Tirana, February 11 - The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper published an article on February 9, pointing out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because this revolution will arouse the Soviet working class and laboring masses to overthrow the Soviet revisionist leadership's rule.

The article, titled "Why the Khrushchev Revisionists and All Other Revisionists Fear China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," states that in recent times, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has mobilized its entire massive propaganda machine to engage in unrestrained anti-China activities. They have used newspapers, radio, television, and various publications to launch frenzied attacks and insults against the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China. Currently, the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China movement is focused on attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is progressing smoothly in China. They have used every means and made unprecedented efforts to confuse right and wrong in the eyes of Soviet and world public opinion, to distort the content of this revolution, and to misrepresent its purpose.

The article states that the purpose of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's actions is, on the one hand, to eliminate the possibility of the Soviet people learning the truth about the situation in China, so that the Soviet people cannot see the true face of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's traitorous policy. On the other hand, it is to encourage and support the revisionist elements within China.

The article points out that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the roots of revisionism and completely eliminated the possibility of a repeat of the Soviet-style revisionist tragedy in China. Therefore, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has launched a comprehensive attack against Marxism and China.

The article points out that the Soviet Union has now become the center of the most despicable slander and defamation against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It has become the main institution providing sensational anti-China news to imperialists and revisionists worldwide to prevent the brilliant ideas of this unprecedented great revolution from spreading, to reduce its influence, and to prevent the Soviet masses from coming into contact with this revolution.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is in a state of extreme panic in the face of the smooth progress and continuous victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin, has been rushing around in various parts of the Soviet Union, slandering the Communist Party of China and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and the revolutionary masses. This shows that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is in a state of desperate struggle. Recently, under the instructions of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, Chinese language broadcasts have been subjected to strong interference; Chinese newspapers and magazines have been banned from entering the Soviet Union; Chinese citizens residing in or passing through the Soviet Union have been banned from any contact with Soviet citizens. The Soviet revisionists' arbitrary and savage behavior reached its peak a few days ago in Moscow: the Soviet authorities sent police to beat up Chinese students who came to lay wreaths at the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin, and thugs attacked the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union.

The article states that it is impossible to block the truth about People's China and the Communist Party of China, and about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The slander in Soviet publications, the interference with Chinese radio broadcasts, and the beating of Chinese students will not stop the spread of the truth. History has proven that no obstacle and no force can stop the great revolutionary ideas from seizing the hearts and minds of the people. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique will never be able to prevent the Soviet people from learning about and supporting the ideas and noble goals of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from following the example of Chinese revolutionaries to rise up and overthrow the revisionist ruling clique, to restore the achievements of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, and to march forward boldly on the great road opened by Lenin and Stalin.

The article states that the conference of "communist" parties planned and instigated by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is also aimed at China, at China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has made all kinds of revisionists tremble with fear.

The article states that it is natural for the enemies of socialism, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries to attack Comrade Mao Zedong and his revolutionary ideas. Comrade Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist, so the enemies hate him and attack him. The enemies have also attacked and insulted Lenin and Stalin in the past. However, this vicious attack shows the power of Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas, showing that his Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory is spreading throughout the world and is supported by the people.

The article states that no force in the world can stop the victorious advance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Whether it is imperialists, revisionists, or other reactionaries, they can never stop this revolution's growing influence on the peoples of the world and its great attraction. The smooth progress of this revolution shows the Soviet people and other progressive peoples how to eliminate enemies, revisionists, and all counter-revolutionaries. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great example for the Soviet people, telling them how to bravely fight in their own country's specific conditions, to get rid of the poisonous snake of revisionism, to smash its head, and to save the homeland of the October Revolution from the danger of complete capitalist restoration.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is being successfully carried out by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses of People's China, is such a revolution that shows how to prevent revisionism from seizing power, and after it seizes power, how the revolutionary laboring masses should overthrow revisionism. The immeasurable international significance of this revolution lies here.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is successfully developing in the year marking the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, will be like a powerful alarm bell, calling on all revolutionary forces in the Soviet Union to unite and fight against the traitors who have usurped power and established capitalism at home. Undoubtedly, the brave revolutionary actions of Chinese workers, peasants, and students under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly defeating a handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, will resonate deeply in the hearts of the Soviet people. These revolutionary actions will greatly inspire the Soviet people to save their country from the clutches of the revisionist clique.

The article concludes by pointing out that 50 years ago, the Russian example inspired the proletariat of the whole world to launch an attack on the bourgeoisie, throwing the dregs of society, the ancestors of modern revisionism, and other enemies of the working class into the garbage heap. Now, the Chinese example will surely arouse the Soviet working class and laboring masses to settle accounts with the revisionist clique that has usurped leadership within their country. This is why this revolution terrifies the Khrushchev revisionists, making them tremble and fear the future, feeling that they have nowhere to hide.

    阿《人民之声报》指出苏修领导集团对中国文化大革命怕得要死
    文化大革命将唤起苏联人民推翻修正主义统治
    毛泽东思想的传播是封锁不住的，敌人越是攻击，就越显示出它的强大威力
    苏联人民总有一天要同苏修领导集团算帐，光复伟大十月革命的胜利成果
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》九日发表编辑部文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，是因为这场革命将唤起苏联工人阶级和劳动群众推翻苏修领导集团的统治。
    这篇题为《赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和其他一切修正主义者为什么害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命》的文章说，最近以来，苏联修正主义统治集团开动了整个庞大的宣传机器，肆无忌惮地进行反华。他们通过报纸、电台、电视台和各种刊物疯狂地攻击和侮辱中华人民共和国和中国共产党。目前，苏联修正主义领导集团的反华运动集中在攻击正在顺利向前发展的中国无产阶级文化大革命上。他们用尽了一切手段，竭力进行前所未闻的努力，以便向苏联和世界舆论混淆黑白，歪曲这场革命的内容，颠倒是非地介绍这场革命的目的。
    文章说，苏修统治集团这样做的目的是，一方面，为了消除苏联人民了解中国的事态真相的可能性，使苏联人民不能认清苏修统治集团奉行叛徒政策的面目，另一方面，就是鼓励和支持中国国内的修正主义分子。
    文章指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命沉重地打击了产生修正主义的基础，彻底铲除了在中国重演象苏联那样出现修正主义悲剧的可能性。因此，苏联修正主义统治集团发动了反马克思主义和反华的全面攻击。
    文章指出，苏联现在已变成了对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行最卑鄙的造谣和诬蔑的中心，变成了向帝国主义和修正主义的一切宣传提供“耸人听闻”的反华消息的主要机构，以便制止这一史无前例的伟大革命的光辉思想的传播、缩小它的影响和使苏联群众无法接触这一革命。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义统治集团在中国无产阶级文化大革命的顺利发展和节节胜利面前，表现得惊慌万状。以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修统治集团，奔走苏联各地，对中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志，对中国的无产阶级文化大革命和革命群众大肆进行诬蔑。这表明苏修统治集团正在进行绝望的挣扎。最近，在苏联修正主义统治集团的指使下，中国的俄语广播受到强大的干扰；中国的报纸和刊物被禁止进入苏联；居住在苏联的或路过苏联的中国公民被禁止同苏联人进行任何接触。苏修的这种专横野蛮的态度几天前在莫斯科达到了高峰：那就是苏联当局出动了警察，打伤了到列宁和斯大林陵墓敬献花圈的中国学生，还有暴徒袭击中国驻苏联的大使馆。
    文章说，但是，要把关于人民中国及中国共产党，关于中国无产阶级文化大革命的真相封锁起来，那是办不到的。苏联报刊上进行的诬蔑，对中国电台的干扰以及殴打中国留学生，也阻挡不了真相的传播。历史证明了，没有任何障碍，没有任何力量能阻挡伟大的革命思想掌握人民的灵魂和深入人心。苏修统治集团绝对阻挡不住苏联人民去了解和支持中国无产阶级文化大革命的思想和崇高目的，效法中国革命者的榜样而起来推翻修正主义统治集团，在苏联光复十月革命的胜利成果，昂首阔步地重新在列宁和斯大林所开辟的大道上奋勇前进。
    文章说，现代修正主义者在苏修统治集团倡议和指使下打算举行的各国“共产党”会议，矛头也是指向中国，指向中国无产阶级文化大革命的，这场革命已使形形色色的修正主义者怕得要命。
    文章说，社会主义的敌人、现代修正主义者和各国反动派攻击毛泽东同志和他的革命思想，这是很自然的。毛泽东同志是伟大的马克思列宁主义者，所以敌人恨他和攻击他。敌人过去也这样攻击和辱骂过列宁和斯大林。然而这种凶恶的攻击表明了毛泽东同志的思想的威力，这表明了他的马克思列宁主义的革命理论正在全世界传播并且为人们所拥护。
    文章说，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挠中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。无论是帝国主义者、修正主义者还是其他反动派，都永远不能制止这场革命对世界各国人民日益增长的影响及其巨大的吸引力。这场革命的顺利发展向苏联人民和其他进步人民表明，应该怎么样清除敌人、修正主义者以及各种反革命分子。中国无产阶级文化大革命对苏联人民来说是一个伟大的典范，告诉他们在他们本国的具体条件下，应该怎么样勇敢地进行斗争，摆脱修正主义的毒蛇，砸碎它的头，把十月革命的祖国从资本主义完全复辟的危险中拯救出来。
    文章说，伟大的人民中国的亿万革命群众正在顺利推进的无产阶级文化大革命是这样一场革命，它说明，应该怎么样防止修正主义夺取政权，而在它夺取政权以后，革命的劳动群众应该如何来打倒修正主义。这一革命的不可估量的国际意义也就在这里。
    文章说，在一九一七年十月革命的五十周年纪念的今年顺利开展的中国无产阶级文化大革命，将象一座发出强大号召声音的警钟，唤起苏联所有的革命力量团结起来，反对篡夺了政权并在国内建立资本主义的叛徒们。毫无疑问，中国工人、农民、学生在毛泽东思想的旗帜下彻底打倒一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的这种勇敢的革命行动，将在苏联人民的心中引起强烈的反响，这些革命行动将极大地鼓舞苏联人民从修正主义集团的魔爪下挽救他们的国家。
    文章最后指出，五十年前俄国的范例，曾经鼓舞全世界的无产阶级向资产阶级发动进攻，把社会的渣滓、现代修正主义者的鼻祖以及工人阶级的其他敌人扔进了垃圾堆。现在，中国的范例必然会唤起苏联工人阶级和劳动群众同在他们的国家从内部篡夺领导权的修正主义集团算帐。正因为如此，这场革命使赫鲁晓夫修正主义者怕得要命，他们在发抖，恐惧地看着未来，感到没有藏身之地了。
