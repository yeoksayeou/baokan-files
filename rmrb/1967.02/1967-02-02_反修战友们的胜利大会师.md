In recent days, the people of the capital have been eagerly awaiting the triumphant return of our anti-revisionist warriors. This moment has finally arrived.

On the morning of February 1st, revolutionary rebel workers from the capital, nearby farmers, PLA soldiers, and Red Guards from all directions surged towards Beijing Station like a tide. Along both sides of East Chang'an Street, red flags fluttered, and songs echoed through the air. The entire capital was in a state of excitement. Oh, heroic sons and daughters of the motherland! Glorious anti-revisionist warriors! Our beloved socialist motherland extends her arms, warmly welcoming you back victorious, back to the side of Chairman Mao.

At exactly 2 PM, the platform of Beijing Station was adorned with fluttering red flags and the sound of drums. The train carrying the anti-revisionist warriors pulled into the station amidst a roar of excitement. As they disembarked, Red Guards from the capital rushed forward to shake their hands warmly. Comrade Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, came to welcome them.

	“Down with American imperialism!” “Down with Soviet revisionism!” “Salute to the glorious anti-revisionist warriors!” “Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!” “Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!” Battle cries resonated through Beijing Station. These anti-revisionist warriors, along with the revolutionary masses of the capital who came to welcome them, and foreign friends, held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners, waving red copies of the Little Red Book, and cheered for a long time, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!”

The welcoming ceremony began at the station. This was not an ordinary welcoming ceremony; it was a rally to swear allegiance to the anti-revisionist struggle, a victorious gathering of anti-revisionist comrades. A French student who participated in the struggle against violence on Moscow's Red Square met with a Red Guard from the capital. Their hands were tightly clasped. The Red Guard said, “Salute to the anti-revisionist warriors!” The French student said, “Learn from the revolutionary rebels of the capital.”

Red Guards from the Qinghua Jian Mountain Corps and the New Beijing University solemnly pinned red armbands reading “Anti-Revisionist Red Guards” on sixty anti-revisionist warriors. From this day forward, these anti-revisionist warriors returning from abroad officially joined the ranks of the revolutionary vanguard Red Guards led by Chairman Mao, and they will throw themselves into the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland.

Inside and outside Beijing Station, more than ten thousand revolutionary masses welcomed the warriors who had bravely fought against the Soviet revisionist fascist thugs and returned victorious. Look, the revolutionary rebel workers of the capital, bringing with them the great victory of the struggle for power and the good news of promoting production while carrying out the revolution, came to welcome the anti-revisionist warriors. The loudspeaker car of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory broadcast their passionate poems dedicated to the anti-revisionist warriors:

	“Your voices reading the truth loudly,
	Like thunder, shaking the heavens and earth,
	Shaking the dark rule of the Soviet revisionist clique,
	Making the cannibalistic demons there tremble with fear!”

Red Guards from New Beijing University, the birthplace of the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster and the “Beijing People's Commune Declaration” of the 1960s, were in the welcoming procession. They charged forward in the Cultural Revolution, fighting against counter-revolutionary revisionists. When news of the “January 25” bloody incident on Moscow's Red Square came, they could not suppress their anger and spent the whole day protesting and demonstrating in front of the Soviet Embassy. Among the Chinese students injured on the Red Square by Soviet revisionist thugs were their fellow students. A Red Guard from New Beijing University said indignantly, “The Soviet revisionists are utterly despicable, fully exposing their traitorous faces. But we believe that the great people of the Soviet Union will definitely rise up in rebellion. Moscow will also see the emergence of red rebels.”

In the welcoming procession, there were seven red flags fluttering in the wind. These were from seven Red Guard Long March teams from Shenyang, Jilin, and Jiamusi. These dozens of revolutionary youths, with backpacks on their backs and legs wrapped in bandages, marched on foot and arrived in Tong County the day before yesterday. When they heard the news of the Soviet revisionist fascist atrocities, they were filled with righteous indignation and immediately printed protest leaflets and rushed to Beijing to demonstrate in front of the Soviet Embassy. As soon as they entered the capital, they heard that our anti-revisionist warriors were about to arrive in Beijing. These seven Long March teams, with seven red flags leading the way, rushed to Beijing Station. After meeting with the victorious anti-revisionist comrades returning from abroad, they will march to the revolutionary holy land of Jinggangshan to complete their great feat of “conquering the south and the north.”

Soldiers from the coastal defense front and the heroic fleet of our motherland also came to warmly welcome the anti-revisionist warriors. Comrades of Mao's good soldier, the hero Ma Xiande, were also in the welcoming procession. They said, “The indomitable fighting spirit of the anti-revisionist warriors is worth learning from. Their revolutionary actions are the pride of our motherland and our pride. Listen, you traitors of the Soviet revisionists: in the great era of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are not to be insulted!”

Several hundred foreign experts and foreign students participated in this grand welcoming ceremony. Many foreign friends wore red armbands reading “White House—Yan'an Mao Zedong Thought Rebel Corps.” A Japanese anti-revisionist warrior said well, “We rebels, Chinese rebels, Japanese rebels, and rebels from all over the world, must unite on one front to fight.” Belgian friend Behu said, “The Soviet revisionists' attack on Chinese students is an attack on the revolutionary people of the world. Every battle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is closely related to the revolutionary people of the world.” Unite, all revolutionary rebels of the world! This is the battle cry of the revolutionary people.

The solemn and battle-ready welcoming ceremony ended. The sixty anti-revisionist warriors left the station by car. Wherever the caravan passed, the revolutionary masses lining the streets immediately raised a surging tide of excitement. Countless hands reached out to the car windows, countless red copies of the Little Red Book were waved towards the caravan of anti-revisionist warriors, and countless faces of our compatriots, radiating revolutionary passion, greeted the glorious anti-revisionist warriors. As the car passed Tiananmen Gate, ah, Tiananmen Gate, this is where Chairman Mao received the Red Guards, where our great commander-in-chief Mao inspected. Chairman Mao, our most beloved and respected great leader, is pointing the way forward for all the people of China and the world. In front of Tiananmen Gate, the anti-revisionist warriors returning victorious from abroad could not help but sing the praises of “The East Is Red.”

Ah, in our hearts, the reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, a group of your brave young warriors have returned to your side. They will advance bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    反修战友们的胜利大会师
    这几天，首都人民殷切地等待着我们的反修战士们胜利归来。这个时刻终于来到了。
    二月一日清晨，首都的革命造反派工人，近郊农民，解放军战士，红卫兵战士的队伍，从四面八方，象潮水一样，涌向北京车站。东长安街两旁，红旗如林，歌声震天，整个首都在沸腾。祖国英雄的儿女啊！光荣的反修战士们！我们亲爱的社会主义祖国，伸展着双臂，热烈地欢迎你们凯旋而归，回到毛主席的身边来。
    下午二时正，北京车站的月台上，红旗招展，锣鼓震天。载着反修战士们的列车，在一片欢腾声中，驶进站台。当他们下车时，首都红卫兵战士们拥上前去，同他们热情地握手。中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志前来迎接他们。
      “打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“向光荣的反修战士们致敬！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”战斗的口号声响彻北京车站。这些反修战士们和前来欢迎他们的首都革命群众，以及外国朋友们，举着毛主席像和标语牌，挥舞着红色的宝书《毛主席语录》，长时间地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    欢迎大会在车站上开始了。这不是普普通通的欢迎会，这是一个反修战斗的誓师大会，是反修战友们的胜利的大会师。一位参加莫斯科红场抗暴斗争的留法学生，和一个首都红卫兵战士会见了。他们的手紧握在一起。红卫兵战士说：“向反修战士致敬！”留法学生说：“向首都革命造反派学习”。
    清华井冈山兵团的红卫兵和新北大的红卫兵，庄严地为六十名反修战士们戴上了红艳艳的“反修红卫兵”的红袖章。从今天起，这些从国外回来的反修战士们正式参加了毛主席率领的革命闯将红卫兵的行列，他们将投身于祖国无产阶级文化大革命的奔腾的激流。
    北京车站内外，十余万革命群众怀着万分激动的心情，欢迎同苏修法西斯暴徒进行了英勇搏斗，胜利回国的战士们。看吧，首都革命造反派的工人们，带着夺权斗争的伟大胜利，带着抓革命促生产的捷报，来欢迎反修战士。北京第一机床厂的工人广播车播送着他们献给反修战士的激情的诗歌：
    “你们高声朗读真理的声音，
    象千钧雷霆，天惊地动，
    震撼了苏修集团的黑暗统治，
    使那里的吃人魔王胆战心惊！”
    全国第一张马列主义的大字报、二十世纪六十年代“北京人民公社宣言”的发源地新北大的红卫兵战士，在欢迎的行列中。他们在文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，向着反革命修正主义分子拚杀。当莫斯科红场上发生“一·二五”流血事件的消息传来，他们无法抑制心头的怒火，当天整整一天之内，轮流前往苏联大使馆去举行抗议示威。在红场被苏修暴徒打伤的中国学生中间，还有他们的同学。有一个新北大的红卫兵战士，激愤地说，“苏修混帐透了，完全暴露了它的叛徒面目。但是我们相信，伟大的苏联人民是一定要起来造反的。莫斯科也将出现红色造反派。”
    欢迎的行列中，有七面红旗在迎风招展。这是来自沈阳、吉林、佳木斯的七个红卫兵长征队。这几十个革命青年，身上背着背包，腿上打着绑腿，徒步行军，前天才到通县。当他们听到苏修法西斯暴行的消息时，义愤填膺，立即赶印抗议传单，并且火速赶到北京，要到苏联大使馆前去举行示威。刚进首都，听说我们的反修战士就要到达北京，这七个长征队的战士，以七面红旗为前导，直奔北京车站。他们在同胜利归国的反修战友们会见之后，还要进军革命圣地井冈山，去完成“南征北战”的壮举。
    来自海防前线，来自祖国英雄舰队的海军战士，也来热烈欢迎反修战士们。毛主席的好战士、英雄麦贤得的战友，也站在欢迎的行列中。他们说：“反修战士的顽强斗志，值得我们学习。他们的革命行动，是祖国的骄傲，也是我们的骄傲。苏修这一伙叛徒听着：在伟大的毛泽东时代，中国人民是不可侮的！”
    数百名外国专家和外国留学生，他们参加这次盛大的欢迎。许多外国朋友佩戴着“白求恩—延安毛泽东思想造反团”的红袖章。一个日本反修战士说得好：“我们造反派，中国的、日本的和全世界的造反派，都要联合在一条战线上作战。”比利时朋友贝胡说：“苏修对中国留学生的攻击，就是对世界革命人民的攻击。在毛泽东思想指导下的每一个战斗，都同全世界革命人民息息相关。”全世界革命造反派联合起来！这就是革命人民的战斗口号。
    庄严的、战斗的欢迎大会结束了。六十名反修战士坐车离开车站。车队经过之处，夹道欢迎的革命群众顿时掀起了万丈欢腾的海涛。无数只手伸向大车的窗口，无数本红色的《毛主席语录》，向着反修战士的车队挥舞，无数祖国亲人焕发着革命激情的脸容，迎向光荣的反修战士。车过天安门，啊，天安门，这是毛主席接见红卫兵的地方，是我们伟大的统帅毛主席检阅的地方。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席为全中国人民和全世界人民指引着前进的方向。在天安门前，从国外凯旋归来的反修战士们，情不自禁地唱起了《东方红》的颂歌。
    啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，您的一批英勇的年青战士，重新回到了您的身边。他们将在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，奋勇前进！
