	Resolutely Fight Alongside the Revolutionary Faction
	Soldier Liu Shoushen

	Chairman Mao has issued the battle call,
	Like spring thunder echoing through the skies,
	The People's Liberation Army should actively
	Support the broad masses of the left,
	And back the revolutionary faction in seizing power.
	Hurrah! Let us leap with joy; this is our greatest encouragement;
	Glory! Pride! The entire army's fighting spirit is high.
	Under Chairman Mao's leadership, workers, peasants, and soldiers unite to fight,
	And a storm of "January Revolution" to seize power sweeps the nation.
	The revolutionary faction of the proletariat has formed
	A vast and mighty force,
	And the blazing flames of revolution burn across the land!
	Chairman Mao has issued the battle call,
	Soldiers eagerly shoulder the heavy burden.
	How can we let the enemy snatch the proletariat's power?
	We must seize it and hold it tightly.
	For the people, we seize power, fearing neither fire nor water;
	For the proletariat, we seize power, undaunted by death.
	Resolutely fight alongside the revolutionary left,
	And hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!
	Look! The east wind blows for ten thousand miles, and the red flags surge like waves,
	Listen, the songs of victory echo across the land and sea!

    坚决同革命派战斗在一起
    战士　刘守臣毛主席发出战斗号
  召，象春雷响彻云霄，人民解放军应该积极
  支持左派广大群
  众，为无产阶级革命派夺
  权撑腰。欢呼啊！跳跃，这是对我们的最大鼓
  舞；光荣啊！自豪，全军上下斗志高。工农兵在毛主席的领
  导下联合战斗，全国掀起了“一月革
  命”的夺权风暴。无产阶级革命派组成
  了浩浩荡荡的队
  伍，熊熊的革命烈火遍地
  燃烧！毛主席发出战斗号
  召，战士争把重担挑。无产阶级的印把子怎
  容敌人窃取，我们要夺过来紧紧握
  牢。为人民夺权，赴汤蹈火不变色；为无产阶级夺权，粉身碎骨心不跳。坚决同革命左派战斗
  在一起，把毛泽东思想伟大
  红旗举得更高更
  高！看！东风万里，红旗
  如潮，听，胜利的歌声响遍
  天涯海角！
