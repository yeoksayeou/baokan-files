A Japanese worker named Nishikawa, who firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." It is precisely this directive from Chairman Mao that enables him to wage a tenacious struggle against Japanese revisionists.

Last October, the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe was scheduled to perform in the city where he resides. This news excited him and his friends immensely. However, at this moment, a small clique of Japanese revisionists issued an order:

	"Do not mobilize the masses to watch,"

	"Do not applaud performances that praise the other country's leaders."

Upon receiving this black directive, he was greatly shocked. These people had degenerated to such an extent. At the same time, he recalled the series of anti-China activities by Japanese revisionists that had pleased the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

At this moment, he also remembered the words of Chairman Mao that he often heard from Beijing Radio: "I think that for a person, a party, an army, or a school, if they are not opposed by the enemy, that would not be good; they must have gone astray and joined the enemy. If they are opposed by the enemy, that would be good; it proves that they have drawn a clear line of demarcation from the enemy..."

He thought: I must not draw a clear line with these people who are praised by the enemy; otherwise, it would mean "going astray and joining the enemy." I must expose them and struggle against them.

On the last day of October, when the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe performed, Nishikawa mobilized many people to watch. Beforehand, he made a red banner with the words "Eternal Friendship Between the Peoples of Japan and China" to present to the Chinese friends.

During the performance by the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, although a small clique of Japanese revisionists sat at the back of the theater monitoring, Nishikawa led the audience in enthusiastic applause after each performance. When the last item, "The Red Guards," finished, he could not help but stand up and shout towards the screen displaying Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

The Chinese performers came over to shake hands with him warmly. He excitedly wrote the following words in the performers' notebook: "Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and the only weapon for the Japanese people. We must never leave Mao Zedong Thought." He signed it: "A Japanese Communist Party member who will never oppose the Communist Party of China." Then he presented the red banner to the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe. The Chinese comrades gave him a red treasure book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Soon after this incident, Japanese modern revisionists launched an attack on him. Several people surrounded him, cursing him as "subservient to the great power," "blindly following," and "dogmatic." He fearlessly refuted them, saying: "If one is a true revolutionary, one should be proud to have a leader as great and wise as Chairman Mao, and a truly socialist country like China. One should take the Chinese people as an example and follow the path of Mao Zedong." He said: "The great Mao Zedong Thought is the highest representative of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. It is not only applicable to China and other countries in the world but also to Japan. Opposing Mao Zedong Thought is not revolutionary; it is counter-revolutionary."

Faced with the voice of truth, these Japanese revisionists, who usually talked a lot, were at a loss for words and had nothing to say.

To express his eternal loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, his eternal dedication to being Chairman Mao's student, and a friend of the Chinese people, Nishikawa, despite the revisionists' abuse, cut out a photograph of Chairman Mao from the cover of an issue of "Chinese Pictorial" and hung it high on the wall of his home. At the same time, he posted a quotation from Chairman Mao on the wall: "Revolution is not a dinner party, not an essay, not a painting, or an embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained, and magnanimous. Revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence that one class enacts to overthrow another."

A small clique of Japanese revisionists who feared Mao Zedong Thought suffered a shameful defeat in front of Nishikawa.

Later, Japanese friends praised Nishikawa for his resolute struggle, but he humbly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' I remember this wise teaching, which gives me courage and strength to wage a resolute struggle."

### 毛泽东思想鼓舞了日本的反修战士  日本工人西川活学活用毛主席著作同修正主义分子进行顽强斗争

    毛泽东思想鼓舞了日本的反修战士
    日本工人西川活学活用毛主席著作同修正主义分子进行顽强斗争
    一名叫西川的日本工人，牢记毛主席的教导：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。就是毛主席的这个指示，使他能够对日本修正主义分子进行顽强的斗争。
    去年十月，中国北京歌舞团要到他住的城市来公演，这个消息使他和他的朋友们异常兴奋。可是，就在这时，一小撮日本修正主义分子给他们下了一个禁令：
  “不准动员群众去看”，
  “不要给歌颂对方国家领导人的节目鼓掌。”接到这个黑指示，他大吃一惊，这伙人竟堕落到这种地步，同时他就联想到日本修正主义者所干的一系列获得美帝、苏修叫好的反华勾当。
    这时，他也想起了经常从北京广播电台收听到的毛主席语录：“我认为，对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。……”
    他想：我绝不能同被敌人称赞的这伙人划不清界线，否则就是“同敌人同流合污了”，我要揭露它们，要向它们进行斗争。
    十月末在北京歌舞团公演的这一天，西川动员很多群众去看，事前他还做了一面写着
  “日中人民战斗友谊万世长存”的红旗，准备送给中国朋友。
    中国北京歌舞团演出时，虽然有一小撮日本修正主义分子坐在剧场后面监视，但是每演完一个节目，西川都带头热烈地鼓掌。最后一个节目“英雄的红卫兵”演完时，他禁不住站起来向着幕布上映出的毛主席接见红卫兵的画像高呼：“毛主席万岁！”、“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    中国演员过来同他热情握手，他激动地在演员的笔记本上写下这样一段话：“毛泽东思想对日本人民来说，是最有力的而且是唯一的武器，绝对不能离开毛泽东思想。”署名是：一个决不会反对中国共产党的日本共产党党员。接着他就把那面红旗赠给了中国歌舞团。中国同志送给他一本红色的宝书《毛主席语录》。
    此事过后不久，日本现代修正主义者对他进行了围攻。几个人围着他，骂他是“事大主义”、“盲从主义”、“教条主义”。他毫不畏惧地驳斥说：“如果是个真正的革命者，他就应当以有毛主席这样英明伟大的领袖、有中国这样的一个真正的社会主义国家而自豪。应当以中国人民为榜样，走毛泽东的路。”他说：“伟大的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高的代表，它不仅适用于中国、适用于世界别的国家，也适用于日本。反对毛泽东思想就是不革命，就是反革命。”
    面对真理的声音，这几个平日口若悬河的日本修正主义分子，理屈词穷，什么话也讲不出来了。
    为了表示永远忠于马克思列宁主义、永远做毛主席的学生、中国人民的朋友，西川不顾修正主义的谩骂，把一期《中国画报》封面上的毛主席照片剪下来高高悬挂在自己家里的墙上，同时还写了一条“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”的毛主席语录贴在墙上。
    一小撮害怕毛泽东思想的日本修正主义分子，在西川面前遭到了可耻的惨败。
    事后，日本朋友们称赞西川斗争坚决，但是他却谦虚地说，毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，我记住这一英明教导，就增加了勇气和力量，就能够进行坚决地斗争。
