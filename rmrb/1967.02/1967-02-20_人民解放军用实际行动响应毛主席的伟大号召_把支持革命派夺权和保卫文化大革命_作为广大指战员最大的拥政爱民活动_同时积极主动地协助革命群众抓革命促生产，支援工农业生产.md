In the midst of the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the proletarian revolutionary masses implement great unity and seize power, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) units are vigilantly guarding their combat posts while extensively and deeply carrying out activities to support the government and love the people. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers enthusiastically respond to the call of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao that the PLA should actively support the broad leftist masses, and vow to be the staunch backbone of the proletarian revolutionaries. They passionately propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the people; they steadfastly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, supporting their struggle to seize power; and they proactively assist revolutionary masses in seizing the revolution and promoting production, supporting industrial and agricultural production. The officers and soldiers regard supporting the proletarian revolutionary struggle and resolutely defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as their greatest activity to support the government and love the people.

The activities to support the government and love the people in various units were launched comprehensively after Chairman Mao issued the great call that the PLA should actively support the broad leftist masses. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers immediately took action in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. They said, to support the revolutionary masses, the most important thing is to arm them with Mao Zedong Thought. In supporting the proletarian revolutionary struggle, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the broad revolutionary masses with fiery revolutionary enthusiasm. They braved wind and rain, endured hardships, and used various forms to carry out propaganda activities. In the current nationwide struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries for great unity and seizing power, they became extremely active propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. During this period, the Navy, Air Force, and units in Beijing, Jinan, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, as well as the Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia Military Regions, all formed large propaganda teams and groups. Some went to factories and city streets to propagate; others traversed mountains and rivers to reach rural areas, performing in fields, courtyards, or remote villages for the people. The propaganda team of a certain unit stationed in Yanggao County, Shanxi, compiled short and lively artistic performances based on the PLA's resolute support for the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power, the editorial of the third issue of the "Red Flag" magazine in 1967, and the promotion of revolution and production. They performed in streets and alleys, and even in shops and barbershops. Recently, the Third Company of a certain unit in Kunming formed six propaganda teams, which went deep into border villages and farms of various ethnic groups to propagate. Everywhere they went, they visited the poor, recalled bitterness and sweetness, and used political night schools to hold study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works, and organized cultural rooms and wall newspapers, timely conveying Chairman Mao's instructions to the border ethnic peoples.

In carrying out activities to support the government and love the people, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, supporting the struggle to seize power. Officers and soldiers of units in Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Fuzhou responded to Chairman Mao's great call that the PLA should actively support the broad leftist masses. They wrote pledge letters, held oath-taking rallies, and participated in massive demonstrations. They said, we are the proletarian army personally created by Chairman Mao, the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power, and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is our best practical action to support the government and love the people. The Second Artillery Company of a certain unit in Shenyang, during the activities to support the government and love the people, also held a recalling bitterness and sweetness rally. Officers and soldiers in front of Chairman Mao's portrait solemnly swore: "Recalling past bitterness, we resolutely support the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power; thinking of today's sweetness, we will follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution!" In supporting the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in various units took Harbin's garrison as an example, providing the greatest support wherever the revolutionary masses needed help. Officers and soldiers of the Military Sub-district in Xin County, Shanxi, during the Spring Festival this year, upon hearing that revolutionary masses in Dingxiang, Yuanping, and Jingxian counties were engaged in the struggle to seize power and needed support, immediately went there. The officers and soldiers said, wherever the genuine revolutionary masses need our support, we will go there. Many units' officers and soldiers also went deep into units and regions where the struggle to seize power was taking place, learning Chairman Mao's works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thinking" and related articles from the "People's Daily" and "Red Flag" magazine with the revolutionary masses, raising the revolutionary masses' awareness and policy level, strengthening the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and ensuring the smooth seizure of power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and consolidating the victory of seizing power.

In carrying out activities to support the government and love the people, various units also actively propagated Chairman Mao's instruction to "seize the revolution and promote production" to the revolutionary masses, and proactively supported industrial and agricultural production, enabling the revolutionary masses to achieve double victories in revolution and production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, soldiers and militiamen of a certain joint military-civilian defense post in Fujian's frontline together studied related editorials and articles on seizing the revolution and promoting production from the "People's Daily" and "Red Flag" magazine, raising the militiamen's awareness. In production, they actively took the lead, expressing: "We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's wise instruction, being both the vanguard of seizing the revolution and the model of promoting production."

In carrying out activities to support the government and love the people, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, in accordance with the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao on learning from the local areas, humbly learned from the revolutionary masses. They assisted the revolutionary masses in making revolution by learning, laboring, and visiting together, learning the good thoughts, good styles, and good experiences of the revolutionary masses, promoting the thought revolutionization of the units.

    人民解放军用实际行动响应毛主席的伟大号召
    把支持革命派夺权和保卫文化大革命
    作为广大指战员最大的拥政爱民活动
    同时积极主动地协助革命群众抓革命促生产，支援工农业生产
    据新华社十九日讯　在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段，无产阶级革命派实行大联合，大夺权的关键时刻，中国人民解放军各部队在警惕地坚守战斗岗位的同时，广泛深入地开展拥政爱民活动。广大指战员热烈响应我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的号召，誓作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。他们满腔热情地向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线；坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，支持革命派夺权斗争；积极主动地协助革命群众抓革命，促生产，支援工农业生产。指战员把支持无产阶级革命派的斗争，坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命，作为最大的拥政爱民。
    各部队的拥政爱民活动，是在毛主席发出人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召以后，全面开展的。广大指战员遵循毛主席的教导，立即行动起来。他们说，要支持革命群众，千重要，万重要，以毛泽东思想武装群众最重要。在支持无产阶级革命派的斗争中，他们以火一般的革命热情，向广大革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们顶风冒雨，不辞辛苦，运用各种形式开展宣传活动。在当前席卷全国的无产阶级革命派大联合，大夺权斗争中，成为极其活跃的毛泽东思想宣传队。在这期间，海军、空军和北京、济南、武汉、兰州、成都、昆明等部队以及新疆、西藏、内蒙古军区的指战员，都组成了大批宣传队、宣传组，有的到工厂和城市的街头巷尾去宣传；有的跋山涉水深入到农村，在田头场地或偏僻的村寨向人民群众进行宣传。驻山西阳高县某部队的宣传队，他们以人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争和《红旗》杂志一九六七年第三期社论以及抓革命、促生产等为内容，编排了短小精悍的文艺节目，到大街小巷去演出，商店、理发馆也成了他们的宣传场所。昆明部队某部三连，不久前，组成了六个宣传组，深入到边防各族村寨、农场去宣传，他们每到一地，通过访贫问苦，忆苦思甜，和利用政治夜校举行活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，开展文化室、黑板报等活动，把毛主席的指示及时传给边疆各族人民。
    广大指战员在开展拥政爱民活动中，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，支持夺权斗争。北京、沈阳、广州、南京、福州等部队的指战员，响应毛主席提出的人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，纷纷写决心书，举行誓师大会和声势浩大的示威游行。他们说，我们是毛主席亲自缔造的无产阶级的军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，我们一定按照毛主席的教导，坚决支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争，坚决镇压破坏无产阶级文化大革命的反革命分子，这就是我们拥政爱民的最好的实际行动。沈阳部队某部炮二连，在开展拥政爱民活动中，还举行了忆苦思甜大会，干部战士在毛主席像前，齐声宣誓：“忆过去苦，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争；思今日甜，誓死跟着毛主席革命到底！”在支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中，各部队广大指战员以哈尔滨驻军为榜样，凡是革命派要求援助，总是尽最大力量给以支援。山西省忻县军分区的指战员，在今年春节期间，当听说定襄、原平、静乐等县革命群众正在进行夺权斗争，需要支援时，他们就立即前往。指战员们说，哪里的真正革命派需要我们支援，我们就到哪里去。许多部队指战员还深入到一些正在进行夺权斗争的单位和地区，同革命群众一起学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志有关文章，提高革命群众的觉悟和政策水平，加强无产阶级革命派的大联合，使之顺利地夺取党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权和巩固夺权的胜利。
    在开展拥政爱民活动中，各部队还向革命群众积极宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，并主动支援工农业生产，使革命群众在文化大革命中取得革命、生产双胜利。福建前线某军民联防哨所的战士和民兵，最近，一起学习《人民日报》和《红旗》杂志的有关抓革命、促生产的社论和文章，提高了民兵的认识，在生产中积极打头阵，他们纷纷表示：“我们要坚决贯彻毛主席这一英明的指示，既当抓革命的先锋，又做促生产的模范。”
    广大指战员在开展拥政爱民活动中，按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志关于向地方学习的指示，虚心地向革命群众学习。他们在协助革命群众闹革命中，通过同革命群众一起学习、一起劳动和参观访问，学习革命群众的好思想、好作风、好经验，促进了部队的思想革命化。
