The Albanian people have struck another heavy blow against imperialists and revisionists. The Fieri nitrogen fertilizer plant has been completed and produced its first batch of chemical fertilizer to support agricultural construction. Comrades Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu have written a letter to express their warm congratulations and praise the assistance from Chinese comrades.

	NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) - Albanian Labor Party Central Committee First Secretary Enver Hoxha and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mehmet Shehu sent a letter on February 24 to all the workers of the Fieri nitrogen fertilizer plant, extending their warmest congratulations on the plant's production of its first batch of nitrogen fertilizer on February 23.

	The congratulatory letter said: "You have, with great ability, completed one of the most magnificent and most needed engineering projects in our country. Your plant will greatly promote the development of our agriculture, increase agricultural production, and further improve the lives of the people. Our peasants, through facts and construction projects, see how the working class and the glorious Albanian Labor Party are leading them and all the working people on such a happy path!"

	The letter pointed out that your achievements will greatly enhance the labor enthusiasm of our agricultural cooperative members and youth. The power of the people, inspired by your great example, will create miracles.

	The letter said: "While we are immersed in great joy, we have immense, sincere, and internationalist love for the great brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and our great and beloved Comrade Mao Zedong. They have provided powerful and selfless assistance in the construction of this great project. This project embodies our great friendship and the iron-like unity of Marxism-Leninism. Our friendship and unity are striking at the imperialists and modern revisionists and strengthening the revolutionary forces of the world."

	The letter concluded by warmly wishing the workers of the nitrogen fertilizer plant to forge ahead and strive for new victories.

	NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) - The Fieri nitrogen fertilizer plant in Albania produced its first batch of nitrogen fertilizer on February 23. All the workers of the plant and all the workers responsible for the construction and installation of the plant sent a letter on February 24 to Comrade Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu, reporting this good news to the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the Council of Ministers. That day, they also sent representatives with samples of the new products and the letter of congratulations to the office of the Central Committee of the Labor Party.

	The letter said: "The Fieri nitrogen fertilizer plant produced its first batch of nitrogen fertilizer on February 23. This is a great victory achieved by all of us workers and the people of the country under the wise leadership of our beloved Party and Comrade Enver. It will bring great benefits to the rapid intensification of agriculture. Our Chinese brothers have provided selfless and internationalist assistance in this project, fighting side by side with us and overcoming all difficulties together."

	The letter said: "This victory of our working people is a heavy blow to imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism by our Party."

	The Fieri nitrogen fertilizer plant is one of the important projects of Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan, and construction began in the spring of 1965.

	After this plant is fully operational, it will have a very important impact on Albania's agriculture and the entire national economy. The Albanian working class, in order to carry out the glorious task of increasing agricultural production, especially grain production, proposed by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, has shown tremendous enthusiasm and wisdom in the face of scorching heat and bitter cold, day and night, working side by side with Chinese experts. Chinese experts also, in the process of construction, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning from Comrade Zhang Side, the spirit of the old fool who is not afraid of hardship and death, and the internationalist spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune, wholeheartedly serving the people of the world and the socialist construction of Albania. Chinese comrades, in the face of tight schedules, heavy tasks, and difficult natural conditions, followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," overcoming many difficulties. Due to the selfless labor of the Albanian working class and the assistance of Chinese experts, the Fieri nitrogen fertilizer plant was completed in just two years and produced its first batch of products ahead of schedule.

	On the eve of the production of the first batch of nitrogen fertilizer, more than a hundred Sino-Albanian experts and workers worked tirelessly in the workshop for 40 hours. When they saw the fruits of their labor with their own eyes, they all jumped for joy, hugging and congratulating each other.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民给帝修又一个沉重打击
    费里氮肥厂建成并生产第一批化肥支援农业建设 
    霍查谢胡同志写信热烈祝贺并赞扬中国兄弟援助
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志和部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，二十四日写信给费里氮肥厂的全体职工，最热烈地祝贺这个工厂在二十三日生产出第一批氮肥。
    贺信说，你们以巨大的才能建成了我国最宏伟、最需要的工程项目之一。你们的工厂将大大促进我们的农业发展，将提高农业产量，将进一步改善人民的生活。我国农民通过事实和建设工程看到，工人阶级和光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导他们和全体劳动人民在多么幸福的道路上前进！
    贺信指出，你们的成就将大大提高我国农业社员和青年的劳动热情。人民的力量，在你们的伟大榜样鼓舞下，将创造出奇迹。
    贺信说，当我们沉浸在巨大的欢乐中的时候，我们对伟大的兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党以及我们伟大的和敬爱的毛泽东同志，怀着巨大的、真诚的、国际主义的热爱。他们在这个巨大工程的建设中给了我们有力的、无私的援助。这个工程项目体现了我们的伟大友谊和马克思列宁主义的钢铁般的团结。我们的友谊和团结正在打击帝国主义者和现代修正主义者，并增强世界革命力量。
    贺信最后热烈祝愿氮肥厂职工勇往直前，去争取新的胜利。
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚费里氮肥厂二十三日生产出第一批氮肥。这个厂的全体职工以及负责建筑和安装这个厂的全体职工，二十四日写信给恩维尔·霍查同志和穆罕默德·谢胡同志，向劳动党中央和部长会议报告这一喜讯。当天他们还派出代表，带上新产品的样品和贺信，专程送到劳动党中央的办公室。
    信中说，费里氮肥厂二十三日生产出了第一批氮肥。这是我们全体职工和全国人民在我们敬爱的党和恩维尔同志的英明领导下取得的一个极其伟大的胜利。它将为农业迅速集约化带来很大的好处。我们的中国兄弟在这个项目的建设中给予了无私的、国际主义的援助，他们同我们并肩战斗，和我们一起战胜了一切困难。
    信中说，我国劳动人民取得的这个胜利是我们党对帝国主义和对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的一个沉重打击。
    费里氮肥厂是阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划的重要项目之一，一九六五年春开始建设。
    这个厂完全投产后，将对阿尔巴尼亚农业和整个国民经济产生十分重要的作用。阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级为了执行阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会提出的增加农业生产，特别是粮食生产的光荣任务，在酷暑严寒的气候下，不管白天黑夜，发挥了冲天的干劲和智慧，同中国专家并肩奋战。中国专家也在建设过程中，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，学习张思德同志、老愚公不怕苦、不怕死的精神和白求恩同志的国际主义精神，全心全意地为世界人民、为阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设服务。中国同志在工期紧、任务重、自然条件困难的情况下，他们遵照毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，克服了许多困难。由于阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的忘我劳动和中国专家的援助，费里氮肥厂只用了短短两年的时间，就提前生产出第一批产品。
    在生产第一批氮肥的前夕，一百多名中阿专家和工人废寝忘食地在车间里连续战斗了四十个小时。当他们亲眼看到自己辛勤劳动的成果时，都高兴得跳了起来，互相拥抱和祝贺。
