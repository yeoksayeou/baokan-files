The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural areas across the country is timely and speaks the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. Now, we have a clear mind, a clear direction, and full confidence. We will also have more ways to solve problems.

Under the rule of the revisionist former Beijing Municipal Committee, we cadres have made more or less mistakes. Because we did not understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well, we had various burdens in our minds. Therefore, we were afraid to go among the masses and pushed work from one to another. I felt guilty towards Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants. I reflected on my own problems, repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," and deeply felt that I was far from meeting the requirements of a Communist Party member. Chairman Mao taught us: "Communists must be ready at all times to stand up for the truth, because any truth is in the interests of the people; Communists must be ready at all times to correct their mistakes, because any mistake is not in the interests of the people." These words hit the nail on the head. I am a Communist Party member and must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, correct my mistakes, and go among the masses to make a self-criticism. I cannot be held back by the word "fear" anymore. Now, Chairman Mao and the Central Committee call on cadres at all levels in rural areas to seize the revolution and promote production. We must promptly and unconditionally respond to this great call, mobilize all forces to do a good job in spring plowing. Above all, it is most important to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. Above all, it is most urgent to promote the thought revolutionization of people and produce more grain to support national construction.

The letter from the Central Committee says: "The vast majority of cadres at all levels in rural people's communes are good or relatively good." It also points out: "Comrades who have made mistakes should also strive to make amends in spring plowing production. As long as cadres who have made mistakes do this, the poor and lower-middle peasants should understand and support their work." I have personal experience with these words. In 1964, to develop the pig-raising industry, I only discussed with a few cadres in a production team and then allocated a lot of labor to dig two large green manure pits, wasting some labor. The masses had some opinions. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I actively went to the masses of this team to make a self-criticism. To my surprise, the poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Digging green manure pits is a good thing, it's just that you didn't consult us, and it was dug too large, wasting some labor. It's good that you can make a self-criticism!" Now, the masses have problems and are still willing to discuss with me. This incident educated me, showing that as long as you believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and make a self-criticism when you have made a mistake, you will definitely gain the understanding of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The attitude of the poor and lower-middle peasants made me very moved. I think that the poor and lower-middle peasants criticize our shortcomings, which is the greatest concern and care for us cadres. Their criticism is all for educating us so that we do not make or make fewer mistakes in the future, ensuring that we can better work for the Party and the people. However, some cadres still do not understand this, so they have some resistance and even become passive. This attitude is wrong.

The busy season for spring plowing is approaching, and we must lead production according to the instructions of the Central Committee to ensure that we do not miss the agricultural season. In the preparatory work for spring plowing, we must emphasize politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and promote the thought revolutionization of cadres and the masses. Cadres at all levels must not "drop the basket" and "drop the basket" at the critical moment of spring plowing is a criminal act. Our commune, after seeing the letter from the Central Committee, immediately began preparations to convene a meeting of cadres at the commune, brigade, and team levels, and will transmit the instructions of the Central Committee to the members as quickly as possible to ensure that everyone knows.

The class struggle in our commune is sharp and complex. We must take class struggle as the key link, heighten our vigilance, and prevent landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists from taking advantage of the situation. We must not allow cadres who were removed from their posts during the Four Clean-ups to make a comeback.

    挺起腰板　领导春耕
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，发得及时，说出了贫下中农和革命干部的心里话。我们这下子心里亮，方向明，信心足，办法也就会多了。
    在修正主义的旧北京市委统治下，我们这些干部或多或少都犯了一些错误。因为自己对文化大革命很不理解，思想上有这样那样的包袱。因而“怕”字当头，不敢到群众中去，对工作推来推去。我感到对不起毛主席，对不起贫下中农。我针对自己的问题，反复学习了“老三篇”，深深地感到自己离一个共产党员的要求还相差很远。毛主席教导我们：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。”这句话，正说到我的痛处。我是一个共产党员，要坚决听毛主席的话，有错就改，就到群众中去作检查，不能再被“怕”字牵住。现在毛主席和党中央号召农村各级干部，抓革命，促生产，我们一定要迅速地不折不扣地响应这一伟大号召，动员一切力量搞好春耕生产。千重要，万重要，执行毛主席的指示最重要，千要紧，万要紧，促进人的思想革命化，多打粮食支援国家建设最要紧。
    党中央发出的这封信说：“农村人民公社各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。”还指出：“犯过错误的同志，也应该努力在春耕生产中将功补过。犯过错误的干部只要这样做，贫下中农就应该谅解他们，支持他们工作。”对这些话，我自己有切身的体会。一九六四年，为了发展养猪事业，我在一个生产队只同几个干部一商量，就调不少劳力挖了两个大贮青坑，浪费了一些劳动力，群众有些意见。在这次文化大革命中，我主动到这个队的群众中去做检查。出乎我意料之外，贫下中农说：“挖贮青坑是好事，只是没找我们商量，挖的太大了，浪费了一些人力，你能检查就好呀！”现在，群众有什么问题，都还愿意找我商量。这件事教育了我，说明只要相信群众，依靠群众，有了错误就做检查，是一定会取得贫下中农的谅解的。
    贫下中农的这种态度，使我十分感动。我想，贫下中农批评我们的缺点，是对我们干部最大的关怀，最大的爱护。他们的批评，都是为了教育我们，使我们今后不犯或少犯错误，保证我们更好地为党为人民做工作。可是有些干部对这一点还不懂得，因此产生了一些抵触情绪，甚至消极起来，这种态度是不对的。
    春耕生产大忙季节即将到来，我们一定按照党中央的指示领导好生产，保证不误农时。在备耕活动中，要突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，搞好干部和群众的思想革命化。各级干部千万不能“撂挑子”，在春耕的紧急关头“撂挑子”就是犯罪行为。我们公社看到党中央的信后，立即着手准备召开公社、生产大队、生产队的三级干部会议，将以最快的速度把党中央的指示传达到社员中去，保证做到家喻户晓。
    我们公社的阶级斗争是尖锐、复杂的，我们一定以阶级斗争为纲，提高警惕，严防地、富、反、坏、右分子混水摸鱼，不许四清运动中下台的干部反攻倒算。
    毛主席、党中央向我们发出了伟大的号召，我们一定要以实际行动响应这个号召，打好春耕生产这一仗，夺取一九六七年农业生产的大丰收！
