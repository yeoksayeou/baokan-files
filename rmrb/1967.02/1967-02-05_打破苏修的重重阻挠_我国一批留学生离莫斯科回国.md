A batch of Chinese students passing through Moscow departed by train for home on the evening of the 3rd.

Chinese students read Chairman Mao's quotations in unison and sang "The Internationale" and "The East Is Red" at the Yaroslavl railway station platform. They also sang Soviet revolutionary songs.

The Yaroslavl railway station was tightly sealed off by Soviet police on the evening of the 3rd. Hundreds of plainclothes agents stood on the opposite platform from the Chinese students, howling and barking, which starkly contrasted with the revolutionary songs sung by the Chinese revolutionary youth. This fully shows how the Soviet revisionists fear revolution, fear Marxism-Leninism, and fear Mao Zedong Thought. After the cars carrying the Chinese students left the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Soviet police illegally blocked the usual route from the embassy to the station, forcing the cars to take a detour. Only after the Chinese embassy representative sternly refuted them did they reluctantly let the cars pass.

    打破苏修的重重阻挠
    我国一批留学生离莫斯科回国
    新华社莫斯科三日电 一百零八名路经莫斯科的我国留学生三日晚上乘车回国。
    我国留学生在雅罗斯拉夫车站站台上齐声朗读毛主席语录，高唱《国际歌》以及《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，他们还高唱苏联革命歌曲。
    雅罗斯拉夫车站三日晚被苏联警察严密封锁。数百名便衣特务站在我国留学生对面的站台上发出怪叫声，狂吠声，这恰恰同我国革命青年的革命歌声形成鲜明的对照。这充分说明了苏联修正主义是如何害怕革命，害怕马克思列宁主义，害怕毛泽东思想。我国留学生乘坐的汽车驶出中国驻苏联大使馆后，苏联警察无理挡住从使馆到车站的通常去路，强迫汽车绕行，经我使馆代表严词驳斥，才不得不放行。
