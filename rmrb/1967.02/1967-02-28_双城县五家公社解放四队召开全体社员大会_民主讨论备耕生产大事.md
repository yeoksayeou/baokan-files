The Liberation Fourth Brigade of Wujia People's Commune in Shuangcheng County held a meeting of all commune members to democratically discuss major spring production matters. According to a report from the *Heilongjiang Daily*, the Red Rebels, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres of the Fourth Brigade of the Liberation Production Team in Wujia People's Commune, Shuangcheng County, held a meeting of all commune members on the evening of the 22nd and the morning of the 23rd, following the suggestions in the letter from Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding "holding a good meeting of all members of the production team to discuss spring production work." After the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was read, the commune members and cadres were greatly inspired and deeply moved. Red Rebel Han Xuefeng said, "Chairman Mao and the Central Committee care so much about us! This letter is like a timely rain. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's call. Currently, we must focus on the Cultural Revolution and production, and strive for double victories in revolution and production." Old poor peasant and livestock feeder Lang Shihao excitedly said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about us poor and lower-middle peasants! We poor and lower-middle peasants must never forget our roots. I am a livestock feeder, and I will ensure that the livestock are well-fed to guarantee spring production."

When discussing the requirements for cadres at all levels of rural people's communes in the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, brigade leader Liu Shiyou said, "I have made some mistakes in the past, and I sincerely accept the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now that the poor and lower-middle peasants trust me and support my work, I will definitely work hard, lead production well, and make amends for my mistakes."

Since the Cultural Revolution began, the Red Rebels, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres of this brigade have followed Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and have not relaxed their efforts in preparing for spring production. Through the movement, the broad masses of commune members have been tempered, their ideological awareness has greatly improved, they are more concerned about the collective, and they work more actively. They break with the old and establish the new, and even during the Spring Festival, they insist on participating in labor. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Rebels and poor and lower-middle peasants correctly handle the cadres. They fearlessly expose and criticize their mistakes, and for cadres who make general mistakes and sincerely accept the help of the masses, they allow them to work and make amends for their mistakes. Therefore, both commune members and cadres actively participate in the movement and production, achieving great results in preparing for spring production.

So far, the available soil fertilizer has been basically delivered, half of the fields have been fertilized, the quantity is more than last year, and the quality is also better than last year. The seeds have also been basically replaced, and the germination situation is good after the germination test. The wood for repairing agricultural tools has also been prepared. The planting plan for economic crops has been implemented according to the needs of the state, and the planting plans for other crops have also been implemented to the plot. The livestock are better managed than last year, and their condition is better than last year.

When discussing this letter, the commune members reviewed the previous work, affirming the achievements while many commune members criticized and suggested improvements for the shortcomings in the work. The commune members believe that above all, learning from Chairman Mao's works is the first priority. In the future, we must continue to regularly read Chairman Mao's quotations, strengthen the leadership of studying Chairman Mao's works, and the busier the production, the more we must learn, turning the production team into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Red Rebels and poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres of the Liberation Fourth Brigade all said that the letter from the Central Committee calls us the main force for grasping the revolution and promoting production in the countryside. We are the poor and lower-middle peasants. If we don't do it, who will? The key to the year lies in spring. We must actively participate in the preparation for spring production, take the initiative in production, and fire the first shot for spring production.

    双城县五家公社解放四队召开全体社员大会
    民主讨论备耕生产大事
    据《黑龙江日报》报道：双城县五家人民公社解放大队第四队的红色造反者、贫下中农社员和革命干部，按照毛主席和党中央的信中关于“召开好生产队全体社员会议，讨论春耕生产工作”的建议，在二十二日晚和二十三日上午召开全体社员会议。当把中共中央的信宣读了以后，社员和干部群情激奋，深受鼓舞。红色造反者韩雪峰说：“毛主席和党中央对我们多么关心啊！这封信是及时雨，我们一定响应毛主席和党中央的号召，当前要抓好文化大革命，又要抓好生产，誓夺革命生产双胜利。”老贫农饲养员郎世好激动地说：“毛主席对我们贫下中农太关心啦！我们贫下中农一定不能忘本。我是饲养员，我要保证把牲畜喂好，确保春耕生产。”
    在大家讨论到中共中央信中对农村人民公社各级干部的要求时，生产队长刘士友说：“我过去犯了一些错误，我诚心诚意接受贫下中农对我的帮助；现在咱们贫下中农这样信得着我，支持我工作，我一定好好干，把生产领导好，将功补过。”
    这个生产队自从开展文化大革命以来，红色造反者、贫下中农和革命干部就遵循毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，一刻也没放松备耕工作。广大社员在运动中经受了锻炼，思想觉悟有了很大提高，更加关心集体，劳动更加积极；破旧立新，过春节也坚持参加劳动。在文化大革命运动中，红色造反者和贫下中农正确地对待干部。对于他们的错误，毫不留情地揭发批判，对于犯有一般错误又虚心接受群众帮助的干部，让他们工作，将功补过。因此，社员和干部都积极参加运动，积极参加生产，使备耕生产取得了很大成绩。
    到目前为止，现有的土粪已经基本送完，有一半的地上了粪，数量比去年多，质量也比去年好。种子也基本串换完了，经过发芽试验，出芽情况都很好。检修农具的木材也准备妥当。经济作物种植计划也按国家的需要落实，其它作物种植计划也都落实到地块。牲畜饲养管理得比去年好，膘头比去年好。
    社员们在讨论这封信的时候，回顾了前段的工作，在肯定成绩的同时，不少社员对工作中的缺点提出了批评和建议。社员们认为，千条万条，学习毛主席著作第一条。今后要继续坚持经常读毛主席语录，还要加强毛主席著作学习的领导，生产越忙越要学，把生产队办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    解放四队的红色造反者和贫下中农、革命干部们都说，党中央的这封信说我们是农村中抓革命、促生产的主力军，我们是贫下中农，农村中的革命和生产，我们不干，谁干？一年之计在于春，我们一定要积极参加备耕工作，在生产上打主动仗，打响春耕生产第一炮。
