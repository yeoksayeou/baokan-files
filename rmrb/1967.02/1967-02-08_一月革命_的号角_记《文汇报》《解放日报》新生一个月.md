Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao has highly praised the rebirth of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily*, saying, "This is a great revolution." Now, the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* have been reborn for one month. In this month of intense class struggle, the reborn *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, have stood on the front lines of the struggle. Together with all the revolutionary rebels in the city, they have charged into battle, making the newspaper a powerful weapon for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and have made great contributions to the "January Revolution" in the Shanghai region.

In this month of class struggle, the reborn *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* have accumulated a lot of experience in running a revolutionary rebel newspaper. Their experience can be summed up in one point: truly letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy the newspaper battlefield, running the newspaper with a revolutionary rebel spirit, continuously revolutionizing, thoroughly revolutionizing, and forever preserving the revolutionary rebel spirit.

Firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, letting the newspaper be filled with the voices of the revolutionary rebels

Chairman Mao said: To overthrow a regime, one must first seize the superstructure, first seize the ideology, and do good publicity preparation. The newspaper is a powerful propaganda weapon. The revolutionary rebels seizing the power of the newspaper is to seize this propaganda weapon, to do revolutionary publicity preparation. Seizing the leadership of the newspaper is a great revolution, but if there is only this revolution, the newspaper's propaganda content is still the stuff of the revisionist, bourgeois reactionary line, then it loses the meaning of seizing power. Therefore, a revolution must be made in the newspaper's propaganda content. The most fundamental point in the revolution of the newspaper's propaganda content is to truly let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the newspaper battlefield, to let the broad revolutionary masses hear Chairman Mao's voice from the newspaper. On the first day of the rebirth of the *Wenhui Daily*, it published an article by Chairman Mao in 1957 for the *People's Daily* - "The Bourgeois Direction of the *Wenhui Daily* Must Be Criticized." Later, the two newspapers, according to the needs of the struggle, timely reprinted "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts in the Party," and focused on publishing Chairman Mao's quotations on "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," "Peasant Movement," "On the Struggle for Power," and other topics, providing powerful guidance for the movement. The revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels. On the second day of the rebirth of the *Wenhui Daily*, it published with great revolutionary rebel spirit the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" by eleven revolutionary organizations in Shanghai. Following this, the *Wenhui Daily* and the reborn *Liberation Daily* successively published urgent announcements, statements, editorials, and important articles by various revolutionary organizations, fanning the flames of revolution, igniting the fire of rebellion, heavily bombarding the bourgeois reactionary line, fiercely fighting against the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, exposing their crimes in broad daylight, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary rebels, and greatly demoralizing the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* emerged with the support of all the revolutionary rebels in the city. After seizing the power of the newspaper, they continued to stand on the front lines of the struggle, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary rebels, closely connected, flesh and blood. They think what the revolutionary rebels think, feel what the revolutionary rebels feel, and hurry when the revolutionary rebels hurry. With a high degree of class sensitivity, they saw through the enemy's plot to spread the black wind of economism and gave it a fierce blow. The two newspapers successively published eleven editorials, as well as many important reports and articles, effectively repelling the black wind of economism, correcting the direction of the struggle, and promoting the new situation of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" in the Shanghai region. They fully reflected and guided the struggle for power in the Shanghai region and the peasant movement in the suburbs. They eagerly discovered new things in the cultural revolution, shouting loudly for new things, clearing the way, and when a reactionary current of attacking the Central Cultural Revolution Group and the proletarian headquarters appeared in Shanghai, the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* bravely stood up and gave a fierce blow, defending the proletarian revolutionary line and the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists.

Chairman Mao said: "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear. We communists have always believed that hiding one's views is shameful. The newspapers run by our party, and all the propaganda work done by our party, should be lively, clear, sharp, and not hesitate. This is the fighting style that our revolutionary proletariat should have." The revolutionary rebel comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* said: Revolution cannot be gentle and refined; rebellion must be fierce and bold; the sharp and fierce fighting style comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought, comes from the revolutionary rebel spirit of the proletariat. The revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to rebel. As long as the direction is correct and it is the truth, they dare to insist, unafraid of being attacked. They dared to face the reality of class struggle, grasp the sharp issues in the struggle, and bravely stand up to speak. What to support and what to oppose, they did it frankly and without hesitation, not compromising, not muddling through; they swept away the past stifling, hesitant, and indecisive things under the control of the bourgeois reactionary line. After the black wind of economism blew up, some young people and workers who went to the mountains and countryside to support the construction of other places were deceived and came to Shanghai demanding to return to work. The *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* successively published editorials on this, educating everyone to insist on the correct direction of going to the mountains and countryside to support the construction of other places. Many deceived people came to their senses, returned home, and made revolution on the spot. Sharp, fierce, and combative articles were published in the newspaper, making the enemy tremble with fear and lose their souls. The broad revolutionary masses said, "Great! This is the voice of the revolutionary rebels, and it sounds really refreshing!"

The revolutionary storm swept through Shanghai, and the situation of class struggle was developing and changing dramatically. The enemy counterattacked one after another, and each sharp issue had to be solved in a timely manner, without hesitation or delay. "The world turns, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we only compete for the morning and evening." The revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* carried forward this spirit of "seizing the day," fully investing in the battle. Several important reporter commentaries were rushed out in just one or two days. Many editorials were often written late at night, and if it was deemed necessary to express opinions and join the battle, they decided to publish. In just one month, the *Wenhui Daily* published twenty-two editorials and six commentaries; the *Liberation Daily* published fifteen editorials and six commentaries. This made the newspaper timely in accompanying and guiding the movement. Their high sense of responsibility for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and their sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm are indeed worthy of great promotion.

Firmly implement Chairman Mao's line of running the newspaper by the masses, resolutely overturn the bourgeois line of running the newspaper

Chairman Mao said: "Our newspapers should also be run by everyone, by all the people, by the whole party, and not just by a few people behind closed doors." The revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* believe that seizing power and revolutionizing the propaganda content have solved the problem of political direction. However, if the line of running the newspaper remains the same, it is still running the newspaper behind closed doors, running the newspaper by "experts," looking down from above, not deeply involved in the struggle, treating the masses with an aristocratic attitude, then it will soon lose its direction and return to the old road of the bourgeois political direction. In 1957, when Chairman Mao criticized the bourgeois direction of the *Wenhui Daily*, he said: "Many editors and reporters have been living on the old track for a long time, and it is not easy to change suddenly." Ten years have passed, and under the control of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* refused to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and continued to push the bourgeois line of running the newspaper, making the editors and reporters still live on the old track, seriously alienating the masses, and making the newspaper chaotic. Revolutionized and reborn, should we still walk on the old track? No! We must rebel against this, and we must rebel thoroughly. On the second day of its rebirth, the revolutionary rebels of the *Liberation Daily* held a joint meeting of all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city, asking all revolutionary rebels to support and supervise the reborn *Liberation Daily*. The *Wenhui Daily* held a "Let's all run the reborn *Wenhui Daily* well" meeting, inviting all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city to participate. They loudly put forward: "What editorials should the *Wenhui Daily* write, please let the revolutionary rebels give us advice and write articles; what new things should the *Wenhui Daily* shout loudly for, please let the revolutionary rebels provide more clues; what manuscripts should the *Wenhui Daily* publish and not publish, what issues should be paid attention to, please let the revolutionary rebels point out to us; if the *Wenhui Daily*'s work has mistakes, we warmly welcome everyone to give us sharp criticism and 'rebel against us.'" This is a declaration of a thorough break with the bourgeois line of running the newspaper, which was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary rebels.

The broad revolutionary rebels are the strong backing of the revolutionary rebel newspaper. Without the help of the broad revolutionary rebels, there would be no rebirth of the newspaper; without the support of the broad revolutionary rebels, it would be impossible to run a good revolutionary rebel newspaper. The revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* thoroughly rebelled against the bourgeois line of running the newspaper and made a firm decision to rely on the revolutionary rebels to run the newspaper. They developed correspondents among the rebels, humbly adopted the suggestions of the revolutionary rebels, widely solicited the opinions of the revolutionary rebels, and truly put the newspaper into the hands of the masses. The broad revolutionary rebels also took running the reborn *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* as their own business, actively reflecting the situation to the newspaper, proposing suggestions, and organizing manuscripts. Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts in the Party" was published after adopting the suggestions of the revolutionary rebels. Some editorials were jointly studied and written by the newspaper comrades and the revolutionary rebels, and some editorials were written by the revolutionary rebels. The *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* also opened columns such as "Revolutionary Rebel Forum" and "Selection of Revolutionary Leaflets," publishing a large number of articles by the revolutionary rebels. These articles came from the front lines of the struggle, raising issues that were on the front lines, using language that was on the front lines, sharp and fierce, hitting the target, and were warmly praised by the broad revolutionary masses. Three poor and lower-middle peasants from Baoshan County, Wujiaochang Commune wrote in a letter to the *Wenhui Daily*: "In the past, the old *Wenhui Daily* did not listen to Chairman Mao's words and did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. It liked to run the newspaper behind closed doors by a few people, and the newspaper published a lot of stinky things by bourgeois academic 'authorities.' The poor and lower-middle peasants could not understand it and did not want to read it. After the *Wenhui Daily* was reborn, you firmly acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions and closely combined with the workers and peasants. The articles in the newspaper spoke the words of our poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants here also like to read the reborn *Wenhui Daily*."

To run the newspaper by relying on the masses, one must accept the supervision of the masses. The comrades of the *Liberation Daily* said, this is a matter of the masses' viewpoint and also a matter of revolutionary rebel spirit. There will inevitably be some shortcomings and mistakes in the newspaper's propaganda, and the masses coming to criticize and rebel is right. We should strictly demand of ourselves, humbly accept the masses' criticism, and also take the initiative to rebel against the shortcomings and mistakes. The comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* also actively accepted the supervision of the masses. Important articles were requested to be criticized and revised by the revolutionary rebels to prevent many mistakes from occurring.

To run a good revolutionary rebel newspaper, one must be a true revolutionary rebel

Chairman Mao said: "Our newspapers educate the people every day. Our literary and artistic workers, our scientific and technological personnel, our professors and teachers all teach the people, teach the students. Because they are educators, they are teachers, they have the task of being educated first. In this period of great changes in the social system, they must be educated first." The revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* believe that to run a good revolutionary rebel newspaper, one must be a true revolutionary rebel. The newspaper has been taken over by the revolutionary rebels, but our minds must also be taken over by revolutionary rebel thoughts. Seizing the power of the newspaper has changed our position, but the revolutionary rebel thoughts cannot change. To make the newspaper forever echo with the voices of revolutionary rebellion, the people running the newspaper must forever preserve the revolutionary rebel spirit.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* continued to act as ordinary soldiers, throwing themselves into the front lines of class struggle, going to the front lines to reform their thoughts, and being tested in the struggle. The editors and reporters of the newspaper reversed the past practice of standing outside the struggle and simply recording and editing, learning from the revolutionary rebels in the most intense places of struggle and debating with them. In the struggle, the revolutionary spirit of the workers and peasants deeply educated the newspaper workers, especially some editors and reporters who were deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, and many comrades sincerely stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels.

After seizing power, the revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* did not relax the struggle within the newspaper office. They arranged enough time to struggle against the power-holders taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line within the newspaper office. They launched a struggle against economism, waging a thought battle of eliminating private interests and establishing public interests within the newspaper office. For some comrades who were temporarily deceived, they adopted a policy of distinguishing between different cases, patiently persuading and educating them, helping them to free themselves from the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, making the vast majority of the masses within the newspaper office unite around the revolutionary rebels, and together do a good job of newspaper propaganda with a revolutionary rebel spirit. They also organically linked the revolution within the newspaper office with the revolution in society, seeing the problems of social struggle from the internal struggle. On the issue of seizing power, the revolutionary comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* realized that in the current stage, it is the leftists seizing power and cannot engage in any "general election." Therefore, they organized the reporting of the power struggle in the Glass Machinery Factory, published an editorial, and clearly put forward: "General election" is a trick, and at the critical moment of the power struggle, one must not engage in any "joint action" with the rightists; seizing power must be done to the end, and taking power must be done without hesitation; the revolutionary leftists must dare to be the power-holders of the proletariat.

The revolutionary rebel comrades of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li.... We must always maintain the style of being humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried among comrades, and we must always maintain the style of hard struggle among comrades." They said: Our rebellion has just begun, and the road of struggle is still very long. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, always be humble and prudent, always be vigilant against arrogance and impatience, and wholeheartedly serve the people. The comrades of the "Spark Igniting the Prairie Fire" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the *Wenhui Daily* and the Revolutionary Rebel Joint Command of the *Liberation Daily* recently held rectification meetings, reviewed their work over the past month, and decided to work with all revolutionary comrades in the newspaper office to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever preserve the revolutionary rebel spirit, follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and rebel to the end, rebel thoroughly.

The rebirth of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* sounded the trumpet of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, sweeping away the dull atmosphere of "all horses silent" in the national press. The precious experience of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* after seizing power will greatly help and inspire the revolutionary rebel newspapers in all provinces and regions across the country.

    “一月革命”的号角
    ——记《文汇报》《解放日报》新生一个月
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，高度称赞了《文汇报》《解放日报》的新生，说“这是一个大革命”。现在，《文汇报》《解放日报》新生一个月了。在这阶级搏斗万分激烈的一个月的时间里，新生的《文汇报》《解放日报》，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举无产阶级革命造反的大旗，站在斗争第一线，和全市革命造反派一起冲锋陷阵，使报纸真正成了无产阶级文化大革命的强有力的武器，为上海地区的“一月革命”立下了功勋。
    在一个月的阶级搏斗中，新生的《文汇报》《解放日报》积累了不少办好一张革命造反报的经验。它们的经验归结到一点，就是真正让毛泽东思想去占领报纸阵地，以革命造反精神办报，不断革命，彻底革命，永葆革命造反的精神。
    坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边让报纸充满革命造反派的声音
    毛主席说：要推翻一个政权，必须先抓上层建筑，先抓意识形态，做好舆论准备。报纸是有力的宣传武器。革命造反派夺取报纸的大权，就是为了掌握这个宣传武器，做革命的舆论准备。夺取报纸的领导权是一个大革命，但是，如果单有这个革命，报纸宣传内容还是修正主义、资产阶级反动路线的那一套货色，就失去夺权的意义。因此，必须在报纸宣传内容上来一个革命。报纸宣传内容的革命，最根本的一点就是真正让毛泽东思想占领报纸阵地，让广大革命群众从报纸上听到毛主席的声音。《文汇报》新生的第一天，就刊登了毛主席一九五七年为《人民日报》写的一篇光辉的社论——《文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判》。以后，两张报纸又根据斗争的需要，及时重登了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，并且集中刊登了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”，“农民运动”，“论夺权斗争”等专题语录，有力地指导了运动。《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命同志，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决倒向革命造反派一边。《文汇报》新生的第二天，就以大无畏的革命造反精神，发表了上海十一个革命组织的《告上海全市人民书》。接着，《文汇报》又和新生的《解放日报》一起，陆续刊登了各革命组织的紧急通告、声明及社论、记者述评等重要文章，煽革命之风，点造反之火，重炮猛打资产阶级反动路线，猛力狠斗走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们的罪恶暴露在光天化日之下，大长了革命造反派的志气，大灭了党内走资本主义道路当权派的威风。
    《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命造反派，是在全市革命造反派的支持下杀出来的。夺得报纸的大权以后，他们继续站在斗争第一线，和广大革命造反派并肩战斗，息息相关，血肉相连。他们想革命造反派之所想，痛革命造反派之所痛，急革命造反派之所急。他们以高度的阶级敏感，识破了敌人刮经济主义黑风的阴谋，给了它狠狠的回击。两个报纸先后为之发表了十一篇社论，还发表了许多重要的报道和文章，有效地击退了经济主义黑风，端正了斗争大方向，促进了上海地区“抓革命，促生产”的新形势。他们全力反映和指导了上海地区的夺权斗争和郊区的农民运动。他们努力发现文化革命中的新生事物，为新生事物大喊大叫，鸣锣开道，当上海出现一股炮打中央文革，炮打无产阶级司令部的反动逆流的时候，《文汇报》《解放日报》又勇敢地站了出来，给了迎头痛击，捍卫了无产阶级革命路线，捍卫了无产阶级革命左派的大联合。
    毛主席说：“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明。我们共产党人从来认为隐瞒自己的观点是可耻的。我们党所办的报纸，我们党所进行的一切宣传工作，都应当是生动的，鲜明的，尖锐的，毫不吞吞吐吐。这是我们革命无产阶级应有的战斗风格。”《文汇报》革命造反派同志说：革命岂能文质彬彬，造反就要杀气腾腾；尖锐泼辣的战斗风格，来自伟大的毛泽东思想，来自无产阶级的革命造反精神。《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命同志，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命的造反精神，只要方向对头，是真理，他们敢于坚持，不怕有人来围攻。他们敢于针对阶级斗争的实际，抓住斗争中的尖锐问题，勇敢地站出来发言。赞成什么，反对什么，爽爽快快，毫不含糊，不搞折衷，不和稀泥；一扫过去那种资产阶级反动路线控制下的拘拘束束，忸忸怩怩，吞吞吐吐的臭东西。经济主义黑风刮起来以后，一些上山下乡支援外地建设的青年和工人，受了蒙蔽，来到上海要求复工复职。《文汇报》《解放日报》先后就此发表了社论，教育大家坚持上山下乡支援外地建设的正确方向，许多受蒙蔽的人觉悟了过来，打回老家去，就地闹革命，一篇篇尖锐泼辣、富有战斗性的文章，在报纸上登了出来，使敌人胆战心惊，丧魂失魄。广大革命群众说，好得很，这才是革命造反派的声音，听起来实在痛快！
    革命风暴席卷着上海，阶级斗争形势在剧烈地发展变化。敌人一个一个反扑，要及时给予回击；一个一个尖锐的问题，要及时给予解决，不能迟疑，不能拖延。“天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”《文汇报》《解放日报》革命同志发扬了这种“只争朝夕”的革命精神，全力投入战斗。几篇重要的记者述评，只用一二天时间就赶写了出来。许多社论经常是深夜才动笔，认为有必要发表意见，投入斗争，就决定发表。在短短的一个月时间里，《文汇报》发了二十二篇社论，六篇评论；《解放日报》发了十五篇社论，六篇评论。使报纸不失时机地配合和指导了运动。他们这种为无产阶级文化大革命高度的负责精神，和冲天的革命干劲，实在值得大大发扬。
    大造资产阶级办报路线的反坚决贯彻毛主席的群众办报路线
    毛主席说：“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命同志认为，夺权、宣传内容上的革命，解决了政治方向问题。但是，如果办报路线一如既往，还是关门办报，“专家”办报，高高在上，不深入斗争，以贵族老爷式的态度对待群众，这样，脱离群众，脱离斗争，用不了多久，就会迷失方向，重新回到资产阶级政治方向的老路上去。毛主席在一九五七年批判《文汇报》的资产阶级方向时说：“编辑和记者中有许多人原在旧轨道上生活惯了的，一下子改变，大不容易。”十年时间过去了，《文汇报》《解放日报》在一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，拒不执行毛主席的指示，继续推行资产阶级办报路线，使编辑记者仍然在旧轨道上生活，严重的脱离了群众，把报纸办得乌烟瘴气。革命了，新生了，难道还要在旧轨道上走下去吗？不行！一定要造这个反，要大造特造，造个彻底。《解放日报》革命造反派在新生的第二天，就召开了全市各革命造反派的联席会议，要求各革命造反派支持和监督新生的《解放日报》。《文汇报》召开了“大家来办好新生的《文汇报》大会”，邀请全市各革命造反派组织参加。他们响亮地提出：“《文汇报》应该写什么社论，请革命造反派给我们出主意、写文章；《文汇报》应该为那些新生事物大喊大叫，请革命造反派多多提供线索；《文汇报》应当多登什么稿件，不登什么稿件，注意什么问题，请革命造反派给我们指出；《文汇报》的工作如果有错误，热烈欢迎大家向我们提出尖锐的批评，‘造我们的反’。”这是一个同资产阶级办报路线彻底决裂的宣言书，受到了革命造反派的热烈欢迎。
    广大革命造反派是革命造反报的坚强后盾。没有广大革命造反派的帮助，就没有报纸的新生；没有广大革命造反派的支持，就不可能办好革命造反报。《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命同志，大造了资产阶级办报路线的反，下定了依靠革命造反派办报的决心。他们在各造反派中发展通讯员，虚心采纳革命造反派的建议，广泛征求革命造反派的意见，把报纸真正放到群众中去办。广大革命造反派也把办好新生的《文汇报》《解放日报》当作份内事，积极为报纸反映情况，提出建议，组织稿件。毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，是采纳了革命造反派的建议后刊登的，一些社论是报社同志和革命造反派共同研究写出来的，有的社论是革命造反派代笔的。《文汇报》《解放日报》还开辟了《革命造反派论坛》《革命传单选》等专栏，大量刊登了革命造反派的文章。这些文章来自斗争第一线，提出的问题，是火线上的问题，讲的话，是火线上的语言，尖锐泼辣，击中要害，受到广大革命群众热烈赞扬。宝山县五角场公社三位贫下中农在给《文汇报》的来信中说：“过去，旧《文汇报》就是不肯听毛主席的话，不肯照毛主席的指示办事，欢喜靠少数人关起门来办，报纸上刊登的大都是资产阶级学术‘权威’的臭东西，贫下中农看不懂，也不愿看。《文汇报》新生以后，你们坚决照毛主席的指示办事，紧密地和工农群众相结合，报纸上的文章，说出了我们贫下中农的心里话。我们这里的贫下中农也爱看新生的《文汇报》了。”
    依靠群众办报，要接受群众的监督。《解放日报》的同志说，这是一个群众观点问题，也是一个革命造反精神的问题。报纸宣传上难免会出现一些缺点错误，群众来批评，来造反，是应该的，我们应该严格要求自己，虚心接受群众的批评，并且要自己起来造缺点错误的反。《文汇报》《解放日报》的同志，还主动去接受群众的监督，重要的文章，请革命造反派批评修改，防止了许多错误的出现。
    要办好一张革命造反报必须当一个真正的革命造反派
    毛主席说：“我们的报纸每天都在教育人民。我们的文学艺术家，我们的科学技术人员，我们的教授、教员，都在教人民，教学生。因为他们是教育者，是当先生的，他们就有一个先受教育的任务。在这个社会制度大变动的时期，尤其要先受教育。”《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命同志认为，要办好一张革命造反报，必须做一个真正的革命造反派。报纸由革命造反派接管了，我们的脑子也要由革命造反的思想来接管。夺了报纸的大权，所处的地位变了，革命造反的思想不能变。要使报纸上永远响彻革命造反的声音，办报的人必须永葆革命造反的精神。
    《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命造反派在夺权以后，继续作为一名普通战士，投身到阶级斗争第一线，到火线上去改造思想，在斗争中经受考验。报纸的编辑记者，一反过去置身于斗争之外，单纯记记编编的做法，在斗争最尖锐的地方，向革命造反派学习，和他们一起辩论。在斗争中，工农群众的革命造反精神，使报纸工作人员，特别是一些受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的编辑记者，受到了深刻的教育，不少同志心悦诚服地站到了革命造反派的一边。
    《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命同志，在夺权以后，没有放松报社内部的斗争，他们安排了足够的时间，向报社内部的走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行斗争。他们展开了反击经济主义的斗争，在报社内部打了一个破私立公的思想仗。对一些一时受蒙蔽的同志，他们采取了区别对待的政策，耐心地进行说服教育，帮助他们从资产阶级反动路线的影响下解放出来，使报社内绝大部分群众团结在革命造反派周围，一同以革命造反的精神搞好报纸宣传工作。他们还把报社内部的革命和社会上的革命有机地联系起来，从内部斗争看到社会上斗争的问题。在夺权问题上，《文汇报》的革命同志体会到，在目前阶段，就是左派夺权，不能搞什么“全面选举”。于是，他们组织了玻璃机械厂夺权问题的报道，发了社论，明确地提出：“全面选举”是一个骗局，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，绝对不能和右派搞什么“联合行动”；夺权必须一夺到底，当权必须当仁不让；无产阶级革命派，要敢于做无产阶级的当权派。
    《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命造反派，牢记毛主席的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”他们说：我们的造反还刚刚开始，斗争的路程还很长很长。我们一定要听毛主席的话，永远谦虚谨慎，永远戒骄戒躁，全心全意地为人民服务。《文汇报》“星火燎原”革命造反总部，《解放日报》革命造反联合司令部的同志，最近先后召开了整风会，检查了一个月来的工作，决心和报社全体革命同志一起，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远保持革命造反精神，沿着毛主席指引的道路，革命到底，造反到底。
    《文汇报》《解放日报》的新生，吹响了上海“一月革命”的号角，一扫全国新闻界“万马齐喑”的沉闷空气。《文汇报》《解放日报》夺权后的宝贵经验，将会给全国各省区的革命造反报以极大的帮助和启发。
