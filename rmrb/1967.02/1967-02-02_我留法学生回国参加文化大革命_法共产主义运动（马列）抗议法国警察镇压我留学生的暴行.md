Chinese students studying in France, totaling 19, departed on January 31 to return to their homeland to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the afternoon of the 30th, they laid a wreath at the "Wall of the Paris Commune Martyrs" in Paris (the site where the martyrs of the Paris Commune were executed) and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold aloft their banner and march forward along the path they have opened up with their blood! 'The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of man's will. No reactionaries or any other people can hinder it. Revolution is certainly bound to occur and will certainly triumph in the end, no matter how much the reactionaries try to prevent the wheel of history from turning."

On the evening of January 27, 49 Chinese students in France, while on their way to the Soviet Embassy in France to protest against the savage persecution of Chinese students in Moscow by the revisionist leaders of the Soviet Union, were brutally suppressed by the Paris police. Among the 19 students returning this time, 30 others had already returned to the motherland on January 29.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Paris on January 30, the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) and its organ, the "New Humanity Daily," recently issued a joint protest statement strongly condemning the Paris police's unreasonable beating and arrest of Chinese students in France.

The protest statement pointed out that the French people yearn to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese people, and this police violence is a disgrace to France.

The protest statement said that the French Communist Movement, all Marxist-Leninists in France, and communists who are loyal to proletarian internationalism, fully support the just actions of Chinese students in France.

    一月二十七日晚上，我留法学生四十九人，在前往苏联驻法国大使馆抗议苏修领导集团在莫斯科野蛮迫害我留学生的途中，遭到巴黎警察当局的野蛮镇压。这次回国的十九名留学生是其中的一部分，另外三十人已于一月二十九日返回祖国。
