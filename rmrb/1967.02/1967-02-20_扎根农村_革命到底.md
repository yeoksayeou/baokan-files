Chairman Mao teaches us: "The countryside is a vast expanse where one can do great things."

In the past, a small clique within the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee who were taking the capitalist road, along with a small gang of bad elements in the Provincial Resettlement Office, ignored Chairman Mao's great directive. Instead of mobilizing and educating the intellectual youth to go to the countryside with Mao Zedong Thought, they used leather shoes, suitcases, bedding, promotions, and wealth to entice the youth to go to the countryside. They used the idea of "small families" and work points to corrupt the youth who went to the countryside. This is a thoroughgoing revisionist resettlement line. This revisionist resettlement line cannot cultivate and produce successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution; it can only produce revisionist seeds, making our country face the danger of capitalist restoration.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrible, but in reality, they are not so powerful. As we all know, tigers have the reputation of being ferocious, but in fact, they are often afraid of men. The same is true of reactionaries. In essence, they are paper tigers. This is also true of sweeping. If the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." The small clique within the former Heilongjiang Provincial Committee who were taking the capitalist road, along with a small gang of bad elements in the Provincial Resettlement Office, seeing that their first scheme failed, came up with another. At a time when many intellectual youth who went to the countryside were rising up in rebellion, they brought out the rotten goods of economism. They incited some temporarily deceived youth to enter the cities, demanding a change of household registration, attempting to use the Cultural Revolution to change their household registration back to the cities. This small gang of bad elements wanted, through this trick, to resist Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," disrupt agricultural production, disrupt the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and achieve their despicable goal of slipping through.

Comrades, intellectual youth who went to the countryside in Heilongjiang Province, we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold and not fall for the tricks of the small clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We went to the countryside to labor in response to Chairman Mao's great call. Our path is correct. We must dig in the countryside, stay in the countryside for life, dedicate all our strength to the countryside, and dedicate it to the great cause of communism.

    扎根农村　革命到底
    黑龙江革命下乡知识青年红色造反团　部分战士
    毛主席教导我们：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”
    过去，黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和省安置办公室的一小撮坏蛋，无视毛主席的这一伟大指示，他们不是用毛泽东思想去动员知识青年下乡，不是用毛泽东思想去教育下乡知识青年，而是用皮鞋、皮箱、被褥，用升官发财，用发展入党、入团来诱惑知识青年下乡，用“小家庭”、工分等来腐蚀下乡知识青年。这是一条地地道道的修正主义安置路线。这条修正主义的安置路线不能培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，只能培养出一些修正主义的苗子，使我们国家存在着资本主义复辟的危险。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”前黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和省安置办公室中的一小撮坏蛋们，见一计不成，又生一计，在广大下乡知识青年纷纷起来造反的时候，又搬出经济主义的破烂货。他们挑动一些暂时受蒙蔽的知识青年，进入城市，闹着迁移户口，妄图趁文化大革命之机迁回城市来。这一小撮坏蛋妄想通过这一手，来抵制毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，破坏农业生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，达到他们蒙混过关的卑鄙目的。我们绝不答应。
    黑龙江省下乡革命知识青年同志们，我们要百倍提高革命警惕，不上党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的当。我们下乡劳动，这是响应毛主席的伟大号召。我们的路子走得对，要在农村扎根，要在农村干一辈子，把一切力量献给农村，献给伟大的共产主义事业。
