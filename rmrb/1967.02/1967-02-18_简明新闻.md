Tanzania Nationalizes Eight Flour Mills

The Tanzanian government recently issued a statement announcing the nationalization of eight flour mills. This is another nationalization measure following the recent nationalization of all banks in Tanzania.

The statement declared that these eight flour mills have been placed under the supervision of the National Agricultural Products Bureau, which represents the Ministry of Commerce and Cooperation.

PLO Implements Austerity Measures

The Revolutionary Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization recently passed a resolution to reduce the salaries of some officers and implement austerity measures within the Palestine Liberation Army.

PLO Chairman Shukeiri stated that the purpose of this decision is to make the Palestine Liberation Army a true revolutionary army, ready to wage a liberation war at any time. Therefore, the budget of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Liberation Army must be a revolutionary budget based on austerity policies.

UAR Bans US and UK Military Aircraft

According to a report in Cairo newspapers on the 14th, the United Arab Republic (UAR) has decided to ban American and British military aircraft from landing at UAR airports and from flying over UAR airspace. The UAR authorities took this measure after noticing that American and British aircraft flying from Libya's Sidi Barrani Airport to Jordan's Aqaba Airport and from Malta to Aden were carrying troops and equipment.

Japanese Reactionaries Openly Advocate Nuclear Armament

On February 9, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Japanese government, Shimozawa Takezo, openly declared that Japan has the right to conduct nuclear tests for "peaceful purposes." Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku also stated on the 10th that the Foreign Ministry should seriously study the issue of nuclear tests for "peaceful purposes."

This indicates that while the US imperialists are colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to create a deceptive "nuclear non-proliferation treaty," they are also, under the guise of "peaceful use," aiding Japanese militarists in achieving nuclear armament.
