Revolutionary rebels from the proletariat of the capital, including workers, peasants, students, and cadres from government agencies, braved the snow on the 9th to visit Beijing Anti-Imperialist Hospital. They expressed their class solidarity by visiting the Chinese students who were severely injured by Soviet revisionist military police while paying their respects at the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin.

When the visitors met the anti-revisionist fighters, the hospital ward was filled with the joy of class brothers reuniting. The anti-revisionist fighters first shared their immense happiness at returning to the side of Chairman Mao, and they recounted the heroic struggle of their 69 classmates against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists.

Yellow Jian, who was severely injured, said, "In the face of these vicious fascist thugs, it was the great thought of Mao Zedong that gave us boundless strength. We held each other's arms tightly; when one fell, several pairs of hands helped him up; when one was injured, several rushed forward to take his place. The invincible thought of Mao Zedong united us into a strong revolutionary collective. We want to warn the Soviet revisionist traitors: You can break our heads and shatter our bones, but you cannot shake our iron will to oppose imperialism and revisionism."

The fearless spirit of the anti-revisionist fighters deeply moved their revolutionary rebel comrades. The representatives of the revolutionary rebels raised their fists and shouted, "Salute to the anti-revisionist fighters! Learn from the anti-revisionist fighters! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They pinned Mao badges on the chests of anti-revisionist fighters like Yellow Jian and Chen Lukuai, and excitedly vowed to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the anti-revisionist fighters, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to thoroughly uproot revisionism, and to ensure that our country will never change color. The anti-revisionist fighters, lying on their beds, were moved to tears. They shouted, "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong! Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified! Long live Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

In recent days, many Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres from various schools and agencies have enthusiastically visited the Beijing Anti-Imperialist Hospital to express their warmth and wishes to the anti-revisionist fighters, hoping they will recover soon and participate in the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    向英勇的反修战士致敬！
    首都革命造反派代表慰问受伤留学生
    新华社十日讯　首都无产阶级革命造反派的工人、农民、学生和机关干部的代表，满怀阶级情谊，九日冒雪赶到北京反帝医院，慰问因晋谒列宁、斯大林陵墓而遭苏修军警殴打受重伤的我国留学生。
    前往医院慰问的人们会见反修战士们的时候，病房里洋溢着阶级亲兄弟团聚的欢乐气氛。反修战士首先向革命战友倾吐了他们回到毛主席身边的无限幸福的心情，同时介绍了他们六十九名同学同苏修法西斯暴行进行英勇斗争的事迹。
    身受重伤的反修战士黄建同说，我们在凶恶的法西斯暴徒面前，是伟大的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷无尽的力量。我们手臂紧挽着手臂，一个人倒下去，几双手把他扶起来；一个人受伤了，几个人冲上去顶住。战无不胜的毛泽东思想把我们组成一个坚强的革命集体。我们要正告苏修叛徒：你们可以打破我们的头颅，打断我们的筋骨，但是休想动摇半点我们反帝反修的钢铁意志。
    反修战士不畏强暴的英雄气概深深感动了革命造反派的战友。革命造反派代表们振臂高呼：“向反修战士致敬！”“向反修战士学习！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们把毛主席像章别在黄建同、陈履奎等反修战士的胸前，并且激动地表示要学习反修战士们的革命精神，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，使我们的国家永不变色。反修战士们这时热泪盈眶，他们卧在病床上高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“革命无罪，造反有理！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    这几天，许多学校的红卫兵、革命师生和机关革命干部，纷纷到北京反帝医院热情慰问反修战士，祝愿他们尽快恢复健康，早日参加伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
