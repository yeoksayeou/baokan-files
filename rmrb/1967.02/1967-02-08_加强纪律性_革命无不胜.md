Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world." We, the red rebels, are the destroyers of the old world and the creators of the new world. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have thoroughly smashed the revisionist system established by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in our academy, seizing power and establishing a new management system.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we, together with the broad masses of red rebels, have thoroughly disrupted the "independent kingdom" of Heilongjiang Province, seizing the fate of Heilongjiang Province into the hands of the red rebels!

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have thoroughly smashed the various rules and regulations set by representatives of the bourgeoisie, breaking the shackles imposed on us by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, smashing the black organizational discipline that serves the counter-revolutionary revisionist restoration, and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois reactionary line that suppresses the revolutionary mass movement. Thus, we have firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and greatly boosted the morale of the red rebels. Over the past half year, the great practice of class struggle has proven: first destroy, then build; in destruction, there is construction. This is the dialectics of history. Only by following this historical dialectics to deal with society and nature, struggling against heaven, earth, and people, can the red rebels truly be called proletarian revolutionaries.

Today, to truly shoulder the combat tasks entrusted to us by Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses, to become a genuine revolutionary leftist, we must also carry out a thorough revolution in our minds and souls.

Within our Red Rebel Team, during the struggle and growth, there also exist extremely harmful non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, liberalism, subjectivism, individualism, and other erroneous tendencies. Some comrades, while smashing the black organizational discipline of the bourgeois reactionary line, have not established the organizational discipline of proletarian revolution, lacking proletarian organizational discipline. They do not understand that denying proletarian revolutionary discipline is equivalent to disarming the proletariat and serving the bourgeoisie. They confuse the boundaries between proletarian organizational discipline and bourgeois organizational discipline. They regard all regulations made to strengthen combat effectiveness as "frameworks" and oppose them, calling it "breaking the frameworks." Such people, while being in the Red Rebel Team, always stand aloof from all activities of the Red Rebel Team, forming a state of anarchism.

Some comrades, when their proposals are rejected by the majority of rebels and not adopted, cry out "undemocratic," "suppressing democracy," calling it "give me great democracy." They do not prioritize revolutionary interests, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, but rather put "interest" first, with individualism leading, and for the work assigned to them, if it does not match their "interest," they either refuse to execute it, or work passively, or leave halfway, calling it "I won't be a fool." They do not understand that the organizational principle of the revolutionary faction is democratic centralism, and do not understand that the great democracy advocated by Chairman Mao is a means for us to complete political tasks, not the goal.

Some people are Marxist-Leninist to others but liberal to themselves. They do not participate in meetings, and the resolutions of the majority of rebels can be executed or not executed, freely and arbitrarily, thinking they are "old rebels," showing off their seniority, unable to do big things, unwilling to do small things. Such people do not want to do painstaking ideological work, only wanting to "do big things," thinking they are naturally "leftists."

Some people are controlled by weak and incompetent thoughts, treating themselves as appendages of the rebel team, not as members of the revolutionary ranks. Every time they attend meetings to discuss issues, these people just act as "guests," "making up the numbers." They do not understand that the Red Rebel Team is a tool for executing revolutionary tasks, and they are members of it. Their thoughts are actually a variation of the mercenary ideology in the Red Fourth Army thirty-eight years ago.

These erroneous tendencies, although not the mainstream within the rebel team, exist and weaken the combat effectiveness of the leftist organization, corrupting some comrades' proletarian revolutionary rebel spirit. The existence of these erroneous tendencies hinders the rapid development of the movement, causing some unnecessary twists and turns.

The emergence of these negative tendencies is a reflection of class struggle and the struggle between two lines within the revolutionary rebels, exposing the petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness. The root of these erroneous thoughts is ultimately a matter of "self," of individualism.

The greatest characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary faction is that they are the most rich in revolutionary rebel spirit. They not only dare to rebel against all the monsters and demons in society but also dare to rebel against everything in their minds and souls that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. At this critical moment of the great union and great seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary faction, to adapt to the needs of the struggle, we must also carry out a proletarian seizure of power in our minds. For various erroneous tendencies within the leftist ranks, we must also carry out a thorough smashing. Thoroughly criticize and expose these erroneous tendencies, making those messy things have no market in the rebel team and in the minds of every red rebel. We must all respond to the great call of Comrade Lin Biao, studying the "Three Articles" as our motto. At the same time, we must seriously study the article "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party," touching the soul.

Ideological remolding must be headed by "break" and led by "revolution," with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner. To truly uproot the "self" from the soul and eliminate individualism, one must inevitably go through a painful process. Those who are used to comfort cannot become proletarian revolutionaries. In ideological remolding, wanting to take shortcuts, wanting to find an easy way, wanting comfort, the result is to gradually become a genuine revisionist.

The current problem is still the problem of "breaking." Only by breaking can there be establishment. Only by breaking the bourgeois frameworks can a new revolutionary order be established. Only by breaking the black organizational discipline of counter-revolutionary revisionism can the revolutionary organizational discipline advocated by Chairman Mao be established. Only by breaking ultra-democracy can the great democracy advocated by Chairman Mao truly be formed. Only by breaking the petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness in one's mind can a proletarian revolutionary worldview be established.

In short, one word: no breaking, no establishment; first break, then establish; in breaking, there is establishment. This is the dialectics of history. Let us wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to cause a great uproar in the "Heavenly Palace," thoroughly smashing the "self" deep in the soul. We can only be proletarian revolutionary leftists, never appearing as ephemeral figures on the stage of history.

"Many things are urgent; heaven and earth turn, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Let us advance! Advance! Advance! Along the red route personally blazed by Chairman Mao!

    加强纪律性　革命无不胜
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团
    毛主席教导我们：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们红色造反者是旧世界的破坏者，是新世界的创造者。我们按照毛主席的这个教导，大破了我院一小撮反革命修正主义分子所建立的修正主义体系，把大权夺到了我们红色造反者手中，建立了新的管理制度。
    我们根据毛主席这个教导，同广大红色造反者一道，大乱了黑龙江省的“独立王国”，把黑龙江省的命运掌握在红色造反派的手中了！
    我们根据毛主席这个教导，大破了资产阶级代表人物所设下的种种清规戒律，打碎了一小撮反革命修正主义分子强加于我们的枷锁，粉碎了为反革命修正主义复辟服务的黑组织纪律，大破了镇压革命群众运动的资产阶级反动路线。从而，大立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大长了红色造反派的志气。半年多来，阶级斗争的伟大实践证明：先破后立，破中有立，这是历史辩证法。红色造反派只有遵照这一历史辩证法去对待社会，对待自然，与天奋斗，与地奋斗，与人奋斗，才能真正称得起是无产阶级革命派。
    今天，为了真正担负起毛主席和广大革命人民所赋予我们红色造反团的战斗任务，为了成为一个当之无愧的革命左派，在自己头脑里也必须来个大破，灵魂深处彻底造反。
    我们红色造反团内部在斗争中，在成长中，也存在着极其有害的非组织观点，极端民主化，自由主义，主观主义，个人主义等等错误倾向。有的同志，在大破资产阶级反动路线黑组织纪律的同时，没有树立起无产阶级革命的组织纪律观点，缺乏无产阶级的组织纪律性。他们不懂得：否认无产阶级革命纪律，“就等于为资产阶级效劳而完全解除无产阶级的武装”。他们混淆了无产阶级组织纪律性和资产阶级组织纪律性的界限。他们把一些为加强战斗力而作的规定一概视之为“框框”而加以反对，美其名曰：打破“框框”。这种人，身在红色造反团，但始终游离于红色造反团的一切活动之外，形成一种无政府主义状态。
    还有的同志，当自己的提议被多数造反者否决，而不予采纳时，就大叫“不民主”，“压制民主”，美其名曰：“还我大民主”。他们不是以革命利益为重，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，而是“兴趣”当头，个人主义领先，对于分配给他们的工作，稍不合自己的“兴趣”，或拒不执行，或消极怠工，或中途不辞而别，美其名曰：“我不当阿斗”。他们不懂得革命派的组织原则是民主集中制，不懂得毛主席提倡的大民主是我们去完成政治任务的一种手段，而决不是目的。
    有一些人，对别人是马列主义，对自己是自由主义。会议不参加，多数造反者的决议可以执行可以不执行，自由放任，自以为是“老造反”，摆老资格，大事做不来，小事又不愿作。这种人不愿意作艰苦细致的思想工作，只想“大干”，自认为是当然的“左派”。
    还有一些人，被软弱无能的思想所控制，自己把自己当作了造反团的附属品，不把自己当作革命队伍中的一员。每次开会研究问题，这些人只当“陪客”，“凑人数”。他们不了解红色造反团是执行革命任务的工具，而自己则是其中的一员。他们的这种思想，其实是三十八年前红四军中雇佣思想在今天的变种。
    这些错误倾向，在造反团内虽不是主流，但它的存在，影响和削弱了左派组织的战斗力，腐蚀着一些同志的无产阶级革命造反精神。这些错误倾向的存在，阻碍了运动的迅速发展，使运动出现了一些不必要的波折。
    这些不良倾向的出现，是阶级斗争、两条路线斗争在革命造反派内部的反映，是小资产阶级思想意识的暴露。这些错误思想的根源，归根到底就是一个“私”字，就是个人主义。
    无产阶级革命派的最大特点，就是最富有革命造反精神。他们不仅敢于造社会上一切牛鬼蛇神的反，而且也敢造自己头脑灵魂深处一切不符合毛泽东思想的反。在无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的关键时刻，为了适应斗争的需要，在自己头脑里也必须来个无产阶级的夺权。对于左派队伍中的各种错误倾向，也必须来个大破。彻底批倒批臭这些错误倾向，使那些乌七八糟的东西在造反团中没有市场，在每个红色造反者头脑里没有市场。我们每个同志都要响应林彪副主席的伟大号召，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学。同时，我们也要认真学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇文章，触及灵魂。
    思想改造，必须“破”字当头，“革”字领先，毛泽东思想挂帅。要真正从灵魂深处挖掉“私”字，铲除个人主义，必然要经过一个痛苦的过程。习惯于舒舒服服的人，是当不了无产阶级革命派的。在思想改造上，想投机取巧，想寻找捷径，想舒舒服服，其结果就逐步演变成了地地道道的修正主义者。
    当前的问题，还是“破”的问题。大破大立，只有破了，才有立。只有破了资产阶级的条条框框，才能建立革命的新秩序。只有破了反革命修正主义的黑组织纪律，才能树立起毛主席提倡的革命的组织纪律。只有破了极端民主化，才能真正形成毛主席所提倡的大民主。只有破了自己头脑里的小资产阶级的思想意识，才能树立起无产阶级的革命世界观。
    总之，一句话，不破不立，先破后立，破中有立，这是历史辩证法。让我们奋起毛泽东思想这个千钧棒，来一个大闹“天宫”，大破灵魂深处的“私”字。我们只能作无产阶级革命左派，决不当历史舞台上昙花一现的人物。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”让我们沿着毛主席亲手开辟的红色航道，前进！前进！前进！
