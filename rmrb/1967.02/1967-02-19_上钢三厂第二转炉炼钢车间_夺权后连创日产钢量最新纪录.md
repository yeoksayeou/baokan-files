According to Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai, the revolutionary rebel workers of the Second Converter Steelmaking Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, after seizing power, united with the broad revolutionary workers, and insisted on implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." On February 10th and 11th, they consecutively created new daily steel production records. On the 11th, the steel production reached 1,835.5 tons, surpassing the highest record since the workshop's establishment in 1958. The revolutionary workers of the entire workshop enthusiastically cheered: This is the result of the great unity, cooperation, and collaboration of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers. It is a brilliant victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought!

Before the revolutionary rebels seized power on January 16th, the capitalist roaders in power had spread the evil wind of economism, causing the production to be basically paralyzed and the steel output to drop significantly. At this critical moment, the revolutionary rebels stood up, taking over the power of the party, government, and finance of the workshop. The revolutionary rebels followed the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production. They, together with technical personnel and revolutionary cadres, formed the "Revolutionary Production Committees" of the workshop and each shift, leading the production collectively. Production showed significant improvement, with steel output increasing significantly, and both the variety and quality of the steel improving.

The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers of this workshop are advancing victoriously. On February 10th and 11th, they finally consecutively created the highest records since the workshop's establishment.

    上钢三厂第二转炉炼钢车间
    夺权后连创日产钢量最新纪录
    据新华社上海电　上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉炼钢车间革命造反派工人夺权后团结广大革命职工，坚持执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，在二月十日和十一日连续创造了日产钢量的最新纪录。十一日钢产量达一千八百三十五点五吨，超过这个车间从一九五八年兴建以来的最高纪录。全车间革命职工热烈欢呼：这是革命造反派和革命职工大联合、大团结、大协作的成果，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利！
    这个车间在革命造反派于一月十六日夺权前，走资本主义道路当权派刮起经济主义妖风，生产基本上处于瘫痪状态，钢产量大幅度下降。在这紧急关头，革命造反派挺身而出，接管了车间的党、政、财等大权。革命造反派遵循伟大领袖毛主席的指示，大抓革命，狠促生产。他们和技术人员、革命干部一起，组成了车间和各班的“革命生产委员会”，集体领导生产。生产大有起色，钢产量大幅度增长，而且品种有所增加，质量有所提高。
    这个车间的革命造反派和革命职工乘胜前进。二月十日和十一日，他们终于连续两天创造了这个车间兴建以来的最高纪录。
