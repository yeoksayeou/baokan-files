On January 22nd, trucks loaded with copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" lined up in front of the Chongqing New China Bookstore. The trucks were adorned with portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and banners reading "Delivering the treasure book to the revolutionary leftists." Amidst the joyous sound of drums and the broadcast of good news, the trucks headed towards the locations of various revolutionary rebel organizations, where thousands of revolutionary masses eagerly awaited the arrival of the treasure books.

The distribution of this batch of revolutionary treasure books marked the victory of the struggle for power by the revolutionary rebel workers of the Chongqing New China Bookstore, and the victory of their alliance with other revolutionary rebel organizations.

As early as January 4th, four million copies of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were sent from Beijing, where our most red sun, Chairman Mao, resides, to the Chongqing New China Bookstore. According to the regulations, the Chongqing New China Bookstore should, with the "greatest enthusiasm, best quality, highest standards, and fastest speed," transfer the second, third, and fourth volumes from the Sichuan Provincial New China Bookstore to complete the sets for sale, delivering the books to the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, it is extremely infuriating that a small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line in the Chongqing Municipal Committee, Municipal Cultural Bureau, and New China Bookstore showed complete indifference to the sacred task of distributing Chairman Mao's works. They dared to withhold the treasure books urgently needed by the broad revolutionary masses for half a month during the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is how audacious and vicious they are!

The revolutionary rebel workers of the Chongqing New China Bookstore, who had just seized power, were extremely outraged upon discovering the above-mentioned crimes of obstructing the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. They immediately, with the support of other revolutionary rebel organizations, took decisive measures: demanding that the revolutionary rebels of the Sichuan Provincial New China Bookstore and the Chongqing Distribution Center of the New China Bookstore quickly transfer the second, third, and fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The comrades in these units, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, spared no effort to assist. Chengdu loaded the trucks overnight, delivering 11,000 copies of the second volume, and the Chongqing Distribution Center of the New China Bookstore immediately provided the third and fourth volumes. In just two days, 11,000 sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were completed, and efforts are continuing to quickly complete the remaining 29,000 copies of the first volume into full sets for distribution.

After completing 11,000 sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the revolutionary rebels of the Chongqing New China Bookstore decided to prioritize the distribution to model units that are "grabbing the revolution and promoting production," and to the vanguards and pioneers of the Cultural Revolution front. Wherever the treasure books arrived, the people's spirits were invigorated, and joy filled the air. The revolutionary masses who received the treasure books beat drums and gongs, posted joyous announcements, and with hearts full of excitement, warmly welcomed the arrival of the revolutionary treasure books. They held grand ceremonies to receive the treasure books, and in some places, they even held discussion meetings. They expressed heartfelt thanks to the revolutionary rebel workers of the New China Bookstore and other revolutionary rebel organizations who participated in this revolutionary action. The "September 8th" Combat Team of workers at the Chongqing Steel Company, who are on the production frontline and adhering to "grabbing the revolution and promoting production," sent a congratulatory message saying: You have brought us an invaluable treasure—the brilliant works of our most red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts. This is not an ordinary gift; it is a political weapon. We guarantee to resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, to study and apply it actively in the struggle, firmly grasp this invincible weapon of struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

For a long time, the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Chongqing Municipal Committee, Municipal Cultural Bureau, and New China Bookstore, and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, have used every means to obstruct the distribution of Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary workers of this bookstore discovered as early as December 18th last year that these people used various despicable means to withhold a large number of Chairman Mao's works. Just in the warehouse of the market department of the New China Bookstore in the central district of the city, over 40,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works were found. Some of these books had been backlogged for as long as six years. Under the protest and supervision of the revolutionary workers, the power-holders of the bookstore had to agree to sell the books. After this incident, the revolutionary rebels of the bookstore, together with several other revolutionary organizations, established the Chongqing Chairman Mao Works Distribution Supervision Committee. However, those power-holders taking the capitalist road continued to stubbornly use their usurped leadership to carry out activities obstructing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, on January 17th, the revolutionary workers of the Chongqing New China Bookstore, with the support of several other revolutionary rebel organizations, seized the right to distribute Chairman Mao's works.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the New China Bookstore deeply feel that those bourgeois reactionaries detest Chairman Mao's works; they are indifferent to the revolutionary masses' eager desire to read Chairman Mao's works. To excellently complete the glorious task of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, the distribution department of Chairman Mao's works must take revolutionary actions against the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the department and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, decisively and thoroughly seize back the distribution power they have usurped, and firmly grasp it in the hands of the revolutionary rebels.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the New China Bookstore in Shanghai and all the revolutionary workers of the factory, in the great "January Revolution," seized power from the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the factory and printed an additional 3,700 copies of Chairman Mao's works.

    把毛主席著作的发行权掌握在革命造反派手里
    ——重庆新华书店革命造反派夺权后欢欣鼓舞发行宝书
    一月二十二日，重庆市新华书店门前开出一辆辆满载《毛泽东选集》的彩车。彩车上悬挂着我们伟大领袖毛主席像，贴着“把宝书送给革命左派”等标语。车子在欢腾的锣鼓声和传播喜讯的广播喇叭声中，向一些革命造反团体所在地开去，在那里有成百上千的革命群众如饥似渴地恭候宝书。
    这批革命宝书的发行，标志着重庆市新华书店革命造反派职工进行夺权斗争的胜利，标志着他们和其他革命造反团体实行大联合的胜利。
    早在一月四日，就从我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席居住的北京，运到重庆新华书店四万册《毛泽东选集》第一卷。按照规定，重庆新华书店应该以“最大的热情、最好的质量、最高的标准、最快的速度”，从四川省新华书店调拨第二、三、四卷，配成整套发售，把书送到工农兵革命群众手里去。但是，令人万分气愤的是，重庆市委、市文化局和新华书店的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的家伙，对发行毛主席著作这一崇高任务漠不关心，竟敢在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，把广大革命群众急需的宝书扣压半月之久不予发行。这是何等猖狂恶毒！
    刚刚夺权在手的重庆市新华书店革命造反派职工，在查出上述抵制传播毛泽东思想的罪行后，极端气愤。他们立即在其他革命造反团体支援下，采取了断然措施：要求四川省新华书店和新华书店重庆发行所的革命造反派，尽速调拨《毛泽东选集》第二、三、四卷。这些单位的战友们怀着对毛主席著作的深厚阶级感情，全力以赴，予以协助。成都连夜装车，运来一万一千册第二卷，新华书店重庆发行所也立即支援了第三、四卷。就这样，只用了两天时间，就配齐了一万一千套《毛泽东选集》，并且正在继续努力，争取把其余二万九千册《毛泽东选集》第一卷也配成整套，尽快发行。
    重庆市新华书店的革命造反派在配齐了一万一千套《毛泽东选集》以后，决定优先分售给“抓革命，促生产”的模范单位，分售给文化大革命战线上的标兵、闯将。在宝书所到之处，真是人心振奋，喜气洋洋。接受宝书的革命群众敲锣打鼓，张贴喜报，怀着无限激动的心情，最最热烈地欢迎革命宝书到来。他们举行了隆重的接受宝书的仪式，有的地方还开了座谈会。他们对参加这一革命行动的新华书店革命造反派职工和其他革命造反团体表示衷心的感谢。在重庆钢铁公司生产前线坚持“抓革命，促生产”的重庆工人“九·八”战斗团写来贺信说：你们给我们送来了无价之宝——我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉著作，这不是一般的礼物，这是政治武器。我们保证坚决响应林副主席的号召，在斗争中活学活用，紧紧掌握这个无坚不摧的战斗武器，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    重庆市委、市文化局和新华书店的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子长期以来千方百计抵制毛主席著作的发行。这个书店革命职工在去年十二月十八日就发现这些家伙用各种卑鄙手段扣压大批毛主席著作。单是在市中区新华书店门市部仓库内就清查出四万多册毛主席著作。这些书中有的已经积压了六年之久。在革命职工的抗议和监督下，书店当权派才不得不答应发售。这个事件发生后，书店的革命造反派曾协同其他几个革命组织成立了重庆市毛主席著作发行监察委员会。但是，那些走资本主义道路的当权派仍然顽固地利用他们窃据的领导权，继续干着抵制宣传毛泽东思想的勾当。因此，重庆市新华书店的革命职工于一月十七日，在其他几个革命造反团体的支援下，夺取了毛主席著作的发行权。
    新华书店的革命造反派职工们深深体会到：那些资产阶级反动人物对毛主席著作疾恶如仇；对革命群众渴望阅读毛主席著作的热切心情无动于衷。毛主席著作发行部门要出色地完成宣传毛泽东思想的光荣任务，就必须对本部门走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人采取革命行动，把他们窃据的发行大权坚决彻底地夺回来，让它牢牢地掌握在革命造反派手中。
