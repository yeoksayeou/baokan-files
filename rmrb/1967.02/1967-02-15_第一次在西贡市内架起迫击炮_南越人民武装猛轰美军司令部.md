The brave and clever armed forces of South Vietnam, on the morning of the 13th, fired mortars at the U.S. command in Saigon from within the city. The mortar shells exploded less than seventy meters away from the command center, striking a truck in a passing convoy of the puppet South Vietnamese army, instantly killing and injuring dozens of puppet soldiers.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the mortar attack by the liberation forces caused great chaos among the U.S. and puppet forces. The puppet soldiers sitting in the military vehicles jumped out of their vehicles in panic after hearing the explosions. One of the trucks in the convoy, which was carrying several crates of mortar shells, was hit and exploded, catching fire. The Associated Press reported: "There were twenty to thirty charred bodies of (puppet) paratroopers on the truck."

Western news agencies revealed that the mortar shells fired by the liberation forces were launched from a nearby building close to the U.S. command in Saigon. "This is the first time the Viet Cong (liberation forces) have set up mortars in Saigon."

	Vietnamese Liberation Army soldiers bravely pursue the enemy, trampling over the corpses of American aggressors.

    南越人民武装猛轰美军司令部
    新华社十三日讯　西贡消息：英勇机智的越南南方解放武装力量，十三日上午在西贡市内用迫击炮向侵越美军司令部轰击，迫击炮弹在离这个司令部不到七十米的地方爆炸，正在这里经过的南越伪军车队中的一辆卡车被炮弹击中，当场有数十名伪军被炸死炸伤。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放武装力量的炮轰引起了美伪军一片混乱，坐在军车上的伪军听到了爆炸声后，纷纷跳下车去逃命。伪军车队中一辆载运几箱迫击炮弹的卡车被击中后引起爆炸并燃烧起来。美联社的消息说：“卡车上有二三十具烧焦了的（伪）空降部队的尸体。”
    据西方通讯社透露，这次解放武装力量的迫击炮弹是从侵越美军司令部附近的一所房屋中射出的，“越共（解放武装力量）把迫击炮架设在西贡市内这还是第一次”。（附图片）
