The revisionist masters in the Kremlin are increasingly colluding with American, British imperialism and reactionaries, hastily plotting new conspiracies for "peace talks" to betray the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. For this evil deal, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin, U.S. President Johnson, British Prime Minister Wilson, Indian reactionaries, Pope Paul VI, and UN Secretary-General U Thant, are all in cahoots, singing in unison, some beating drums, others blowing horns, some ringing bells, and others clearing the way, working together so closely!

Just as the Soviet revisionist leadership is whipping up a chorus of calls for peace, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk made a shameless speech on February 9, arrogantly demanding that the Vietnamese people surrender to the American robbers. He advocates that the U.S. and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam take "mutual steps to reduce military forces" and implement the "principle of equality" as a step toward peace.

What does Rusk's "mutual steps to reduce military forces" and "principle of equality" mean? Let's use an analogy: it's like a robber breaking into someone's house, killing people, and setting fires, then shrugging his shoulders and saying, "Okay, you can't fight back, and I'll only take half of your house, achieving 'equality.'" This is pure robber logic!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In history, wars fall into two categories: just wars and unjust wars. All progressive wars are just, and all wars that hinder progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that hinder progress, but we do not oppose just, progressive wars. For the latter type of war, we Communists not only do not oppose but actively participate."

The war that U.S. imperialism is waging in South Vietnam and the bombing of North Vietnam are wars of aggression against the Vietnamese people, reactionary and unjust. The armed resistance of the South Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism and the support of the North Vietnamese people for their compatriots in the South's struggle against American aggression are wars against U.S. aggression, progressive and just.

Isn't that so?

The U.S. imperialists, from across the Pacific Ocean, have stretched their bloody claws into Vietnam, ten thousand miles away. The U.S. aggressor troops and their puppet armies have poured into South Vietnam in large numbers, slaughtering the Vietnamese people. The U.S. air pirates have bombed North Vietnam and the Hanoi region mercilessly. The U.S. robbers have destroyed the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Vietnamese people. Yet, the Vietnamese people have never fired a shot, launched a bomb, or thrown a grenade on U.S. soil, let alone in Washington or New York.

Against the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression, whether it is the South Vietnamese people or the North Vietnamese people, they can only use war to resist war, use just people's war to resist unjust aggression, until they completely drive the American robbers out of Vietnamese territory. On this issue, how can there be any "mutual steps to reduce military forces" to discuss? If we allow the U.S. imperialists' "mutual steps to reduce military forces" to succeed, isn't that tantamount to saying that the U.S. slaughter of people in South Vietnam and the wanton bombing of North Vietnam are completely justified? Isn't that tantamount to saying that the North Vietnamese people's support for their compatriots in the South's just struggle against U.S. aggression is completely wrong?

Can we allow this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to succeed? No! A thousand times no! A million times no!

Rusk and his ilk are robbers and also swindlers. They rob and swindle, using both hands, and this is the instinct of U.S. imperialism. In his speech, Rusk also threatened, saying, "It is impossible to stop the war by just stopping half of it." This means that the "bombing for peace" trick won't work, so he will continue to "escalate the war by force," gradually escalating the war, anyway, the U.S. imperialists will stubbornly stay in Vietnam; to get the U.S. aggressor troops to "roll out of South Vietnam" is "obviously impossible." This nakedly exposes the U.S. imperialists' unchanging nature of aggression.

In his speech, Rusk not only blackmails the Vietnamese people with war but also tries to probe our stance in China. He stammered, saying that China should also "be guided by reason." According to Rusk's meaning, he hopes that China will also participate in the dirty deal of betraying the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. This is simply absurd and a daydream!

We, the Chinese people, and the Red Guards of China, Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, have never hidden our consistent and unshakable stance: resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their just struggle against American aggression to the end, until they drive the American robbers, who are facing a dead end, out of Vietnam, not leaving a single one!

The Vietnamese people will surely win!
U.S. imperialism will surely fail!

### 强盗和骗子的逻辑

    强盗和骗子的逻辑 
    克里姆林宫的修正主义老爷们，正在变本加厉地勾结美英帝国主义和反动派，加紧策划出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争的“和谈”新阴谋。为了这一罪恶的交易，苏修头目柯西金，美国总统约翰逊，英国首相威尔逊，印度反动派，梵蒂冈教皇保罗六世，联合国秘书长吴丹，相互串通，一唱一和，有的打大鼓，有的吹小号，有的鸣锣，有的开道，配合得多么紧密哟！
    就在苏修领导集团煽起的一片求和声中，美国国务卿腊斯克于二月九日发表了厚颜无耻的谈话，狂妄地要越南人民向美国强盗投降。他鼓吹什么要美国与越南民主共和国双方采取军事上的“相互降级步骤”，实现“对等原则”，“作为走向和平的一个步骤”。
    腊斯克所鼓吹的“相互降级步骤”和“对等原则”，到底是什么意思呢？打个比方，就等于强盗闯入别人家里，杀了人，放了火，然后耸耸肩膀说：好吧，不准你还手，我也只占你半间屋子，实现“对等”。这真是不折不扣的强盗逻辑！
    我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“历史上的战争分为两类，一类是正义的，一类是非正义的。一切进步的战争都是正义的，一切阻碍进步的战争都是非正义的。我们共产党人反对一切阻碍进步的非正义的战争，但是不反对进步的正义的战争。对于后一类战争，我们共产党人不但不反对，而且积极地参加。”
    美帝国主义在南越进行的战争，对越南北方的轰炸，就是侵略越南人民的战争，是反动的，非正义的。而越南南方人民对美帝国主义的武装抗击，越南北方人民对南方同胞抗美救国斗争的支援，就是反对美国侵略的战争，是进步的，正义的。
    不是吗？
    本是大洋彼岸的美国帝国主义，把它的血腥魔爪，伸进远离美国十万八千里的越南。美国侵略军及其附庸国的军队，大批开进越南南方，屠杀了越南人民。美国空中强盗对越南北方以及河内地区进行了狂轰滥炸。美国强盗破坏了越南人民的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。而越南人民从未到美国的国土上开一枪、放一炮，更没有到华盛顿或者纽约扔一颗炸弹。
    对于美帝国主义的侵略战争，无论是越南南方人民，还是北方人民，只能是用战争反对战争，用正义的人民战争反对非正义的侵略战争，直到把美国强盗完全从越南国土上赶出去。在这个问题上，哪有什么“相互降级步骤”可谈呢？如果让美帝国主义的“相互降级步骤”得逞，这岂不是等于说，美国在南越屠杀人民和对越南北方的肆意轰炸，是完全做得对的？这岂不是等于说，越南北方人民支援南方同胞反对美国侵略的正义斗争，是完全做错了？
    能不能让美帝国主义的这一阴谋得逞呢？不能！一千个不能！一万个不能！
    腊斯克之流，是强盗，也是骗子。又抢又骗，抢和骗两手并用，这就是美帝国主义的本能。腊斯克在他的谈话中，还恫吓说“单靠我们停止一半战争是不可能使战争停下来的”。这就是说，“停炸诱和”不行嘛，我就继续“以战迫和”，使战争“逐步升级”，反正我美帝国主义死赖在越南不走；要美国侵略军“滚出南越”嘛，“显然是不可能的”。这就赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义至死不变的侵略本性。
    腊斯克在谈话中不仅对越南人民进行战争讹诈，也企图试探我们中国的口气。他吞吞吐吐地说什么中国也“应当受理智的指导”。照腊斯克的意思，是希望中国也参加到出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争的肮脏勾当中。这简直是荒唐透顶，白日作梦！
    我们中国人民，以及中国的红卫兵，毛主席的红小兵，从不隐讳自己的始终如一、坚定不移的立场：坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底，直到把面临穷途末路的美国强盗一个不留地赶出越南！
    越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义必败！清华大学井冈山兵团　炸雷
