The great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, which touches the soul of every individual and tests every cadre.

How did I withstand the great waves of this mass movement and firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line?

Where to Go?

This proletarian cultural revolution came quickly and fiercely. Initially, I followed the old rules, but I was hit hard and stumbled. This arduous journey forced me to clarify an urgent question: where to go?

Chairman Mao said: "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study."

I want to learn in the struggle, I want to learn from the masses.

In the past, a small clique within the factory party committee, who took the capitalist road, sat above the masses, ate the people's food, wore the people's clothes, but did counter-revolutionary revisionist deeds to undermine socialism. I had strongly opposed them and suffered various persecutions, later daring to be angry but not daring to speak. Today, the revolutionary youngsters, especially those who were previously considered "trouble-makers," are stronger than me. They dare to be angry and dare to speak. They fight the hardest and expose the deepest. They are not afraid of being arrested, not afraid of being beaten, with only one belief: "Rebellion is justified."

When I was ready to align with these young people, my ears buzzed with rumors: "Look, who are those people? Apart from those with ulterior motives, they are opportunists!"... These words made me uneasy and also indignant! I was uneasy because, did I misunderstand the revolutionary spirit of the youngsters? I was indignant because, why, as soon as the problems of those in power who took the capitalist road were exposed a little, did these malicious words come out?

At this time, thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." I suddenly realized: the youngsters' struggle touched the nerves of those in power within the party who took the capitalist road. Out of their reactionary class nature, they launched various cold shots and sneak attacks, which is a necessary manifestation of class struggle.

Soon, another "settling scores after the autumn" wind blew: "The movement is a movement, after the movement, those who should be officials still become officials, those who should be soldiers still become soldiers, and those who should be criticized still cannot escape being criticized." I was afraid again. Where to go? Where to go? My thoughts struggled fiercely. At this difficult moment, I reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" Chairman Mao's words made my heavy heart suddenly brighten. In August, when white terror enveloped the Harbin Power Plant, I resolutely announced to the entire factory: joining the "Torch Combat Team" composed of more than a dozen young pioneers! This is my solemn declaration of war against the small clique within the party who took the capitalist road!

A Severe Test

Revolution is not an easy thing. Whether it is to overthrow oneself or to overthrow others, one must go through a hard struggle.

Previously, I still had illusions about the deputy secretary of the original factory party committee. I had talked to him, hoping he could realize his mistakes and stand up for the revolution. But I got a stern rejection. Why didn't he listen to my advice? I couldn't understand, so I looked for answers in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action of one class overthrowing another class." Reading Chairman Mao's books made me feel that in dealing with the small clique within the party who took the capitalist road, one must learn from the revolutionary youngsters and resolutely rebel, thoroughly revolutionize, and not be full of bookishness.

This was a good education for me and a good test!

In late October last year, an incident of suppressing red rebel broadcast scripts occurred. At that time, the masses were indignant and strongly demanded a meeting to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. The branch secretary actually named me to preside over this meeting. I thought there was something fishy, he was "supporting" on the surface but must have another plan inside. If I presided over this meeting, once they settled scores in the autumn, they could put a "counter-revolutionary" hat on me; if I didn't preside, handing over the power to them, this meeting might fail, not achieving the purpose of educating the masses, and they could gain a reputation for "supporting the mass movement." At this time, I thought, what to do? To preside or not to preside over this meeting? This is a crucial moment to test me! What to do? I brought this question to Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said: "A communist should be open-hearted, honest, active, regarding revolutionary interests as the first life, and subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests." Thinking of this, I made up my mind and bravely presided over this meeting.

This was another good education for me and a good test.

Because I stood on the side of the red rebels and rebelled against those in power who took the capitalist road with the masses, the class enemies regarded me as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. They blew cold winds and shot dark arrows, politically persecuting me in various ways.

Because the fourth shift of the operation team, where I was, had strong revolutionary rebel spirit and high morale, they tried to disintegrate us and weaken our combat effectiveness by transferring me to the first shift, which was then more conservative. Then they spread rumors and slandered, maliciously defaming, saying that the fourth shift of the operation team was an anti-party clique, and I was a "traitor." They threatened and intimidated, using every means possible.

These persecutions did not make me yield. To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I was determined to revolutionize to the end.

Seizing Power with the Red Rebels

Chairman Mao taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power."

More than half a year of class struggle indeed felt that power was more important than anything else. The various struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie ultimately came down to seizing power and consolidating power. When the cultural revolution movement entered the power-seizing stage, I seized power with the red rebels. After seizing power, a production supervision committee was established, and everyone asked me to take charge. Initially, I was afraid that I did not understand the overall situation of the power plant and could not shoulder this heavy burden. I opened the golden-shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades should see achievements and see light in difficult times, and raise our courage." Thus, I acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, bravely taking on the task entrusted to me. Not knowing the situation? I went to the masses with the production duty group to gather first-hand materials. According to Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production" policy, we solved key issues in order of importance and urgency, driving the overall situation. After investigation and research, we defeated the plots of those stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line to sabotage production with our comrades, properly arranged the 1967 production plan, and relied on the masses to solve key production issues.

The red rebels seized the power of those in the power plant who took the capitalist road, and the power plant was reborn. Comrades asked me to be the leader of the production duty group, which is the greatest trust from the masses. I will definitely do my best to get the work done, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and be a good cadre who always holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    我是怎样站到毛主席革命路线一边的
    哈尔滨发电厂原运行四值值长　李子荣
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，触及每一个人的灵魂，考验着每一个干部。
    我是怎样经受了这场群众运动的大风大浪，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边的呢？
    向何处去？
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，来的快，来的猛。起初，我是照老章程走路的，结果被冲击得趔趔趄趄，摇摇摆摆。这样吃力的征途，迫使我要弄清一个最迫切的问题：向何处去？
    毛主席说：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”
    我要在斗争中学，我要向群众学。
    过去，厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，高踞在群众头上，吃人民的饭，穿人民的衣，干的却是挖社会主义墙脚的反革命修正主义勾当。我曾经激烈地反对过他们，受到种种迫害，后来是敢怒不敢言。今天，革命小将们，特别是从前被认为“调皮捣蛋”的人，他们比我强，他们既敢怒也敢言。他们干的最猛，揭的最狠。他们不怕抓，不怕打，只有一个信念：“造反有理”。
    当我准备向这些年轻人靠拢的时候，我的耳边嗡嗡的响着一些流言蜚语：“看，那都是些什么人，除了别有用心的就是投机分子！”……这些话，既使我不安，又使我不平！不安的是，莫非我对小将们的革命精神理解错了吗？不平的是，为什么走资本主义道路当权派的问题刚揭出一点点，就放出这些恶言毒语呢？
    这时，想到毛主席的教导：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”我猛然省悟：小将们的斗争，触痛了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，出于反动的阶级本性，他们放出种种冷枪暗箭，是阶级斗争的必然表现。
    不久，又刮来一阵“秋后算帐”风：“运动是运动，运动后期该当官的还当官，该当兵的还当兵，该挨整的还跑不了挨整。”我又怕起来。向何处去？向何处去？我的思想激烈地斗争着。在这困难的时刻，我重温了毛主席的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”毛主席的话，使我沉重的心绪，豁然开朗了。八月份，正是白色恐怖笼罩哈尔滨发电厂的时候，我毅然决然地向全厂宣布：加入由十几个年轻闯将组成的“火炬战斗队”！这是我向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的郑重宣战！
    严峻的考验
    革命是件不容易的事。不管革自己的命，还是革别人的命，都要经过一番艰苦的斗争。
    以前，我对原厂党委副书记还存在幻想。曾经找他谈心，希望他能认识错误，站起来革命。可是，得到的是严词拒绝。他为什么不听我的规劝呢？我想不通，就从毛主席著作中去找答案。毛主席说：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”读了毛主席的书，使我感到对待党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就必须向革命小将学习，坚决造反，彻底革命，决不能书生气十足。
    这对我，是一次很好的教育，也是一次很好的考验！
    去年十月末，发生了一起扣压红色造反者广播稿件的事件。当时，群情激愤，强烈要求召开大会，批判资产阶级反动路线。支部书记竟然指名要我来主持这个会。我琢磨着里面有鬼，他表面上是“支持”，骨子里一定另有打算。如果我主持这次会议，一旦秋后算帐时，他们可以给我戴上“反革命”的帽子；如果我不主持，把大权交给他们，这次会有可能失败，达不到教育群众的目的，他们倒可以捞个“支持群众运动”的名誉。这时我想，怎么办？主持不主持开这个会？这可是考验我的关键时刻啊！怎么办？我又带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益。”想到这里，我就下定决心，勇敢地主持了这次会。
    这对我，又是一次很好的教育，很好的考验。
    由于我站在红色造反者一边，和群众一起造了那些走资本主义道路当权派的反，所以，阶级敌人就把我看作眼中钉，肉中刺，他们刮阴风，放暗箭，对我进行种种政治迫害。
    因为我所在的运行第四值，群众革命造反精神强，劲头大，他们为了瓦解我们，削弱战斗力，就把我调到当时保守势力较强的运行第一值，接着就造谣诽谤，恶意中伤，说我们运行第四值是反党集团，而我是“叛党”，威胁恫吓，无所不用其极。
    这种种迫害，并没有使我屈服。为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，我算豁出来了，我要坚决革命到底。
    和红色造反者一起夺权
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”
    半年多的阶级斗争，确实感觉到权比什么都重要，无产阶级和资产阶级的各种斗争，归根到底就是为了夺取政权和巩固政权。当文化大革命运动进入夺权阶段，我就和红色造反者一起夺了权。夺权后成立了生产监督委员会，大家叫我负责，起初我怕自己对电厂的全盘情况不了解，挑不起来这副重担。我打开金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”于是，我就按毛主席的指示去办，勇敢地把交给我的任务承担下来。不了解情况怎么办？我就和生产勤务组的同志一起，到群众中去摸情况，抓第一手材料。按照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，分别轻重缓急，解决关键，带动全局。经过调查研究，我们和同志们一起击败了那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子要想破坏生产的阴谋，妥善安排了一九六七年生产计划，依靠群众解决了生产关键问题。
    红色造反者夺了发电厂走资本主义道路当权派的权，发电厂又一次获得了新生。同志们让我作生产勤务组负责人，这是群众给我的最大信任。我一定全力把工作搞好，活学活用毛主席著作，作一个永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的好干部。
