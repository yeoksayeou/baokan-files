Our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a resounding call to the people's communes and poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside across the nation, as well as to cadres at all levels, urging everyone to seriously grasp the revolution and promote production, mobilize all forces, and immediately launch a magnificent spring ploughing and production high tide. At the same time, they call on the local troops of the People's Liberation Army and military organs at all levels to greatly support and assist the spring ploughing and production work. The Central Military Commission has issued a directive, requiring our military's broad ranks of soldiers and officers to act swiftly, enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call, and actively help the local people's communes to grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, striving for victory in the spring ploughing and production.

This year's spring is the spring of nationwide class struggle. The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with its irresistible momentum, has surged from the cities to the vast countryside. Revolutionary peasants across the country are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and launching a fierce attack against a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party in power and against reactionary elements among the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insist on their reactionary stance. The situation of the cultural revolution in the countryside is excellent! However, the class enemies are not willing to accept their defeat and are still using various conspiratorial means to stir up trouble. At present, they are attempting to sabotage spring ploughing and production to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging our socialist economy and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Smashing the class enemies' conspiracies, doing a good job in spring ploughing and production, and ensuring a bumper harvest this year are of great significance for promoting the development of the entire socialist construction cause and for guaranteeing the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao calls on us: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses. Our army is always a fighting force, a work team, and a production team. Doing mass work and supporting mass production are our army's glorious traditions. In this struggle to seize victory in spring ploughing and production, at this critical moment of seizing every second, we have a duty to stand up and, to the best of our abilities, support the rural people's communes and do a good job in spring ploughing and production. This is also the most practical and powerful support for the broad leftist masses.

In supporting spring ploughing and production, the most important thing is to be a good propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. We should use various forms to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, propagate the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and propagate the great strategic significance of the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao. We should propagate to the cadres at all levels of the people's communes how to correctly handle the masses' criticism, and to the poor and lower-middle peasants how to correctly handle cadres who have shortcomings and mistakes, so that all poor and lower-middle peasants and other laboring peasants, all revolutionary cadres, and all cadres who have made mistakes but are determined to correct them can unite under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, jointly make revolution, jointly promote production, respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call, and successfully complete the glorious task of spring ploughing and production.

We should also seize the opportunity to support the spring ploughing and production of the rural people's communes with manpower and technical forces, fully playing the army's role in production. In production labor, we should not fear hardship or fatigue, take on heavy tasks, blend in with the masses, and set an example in grasping the revolution and promoting production, using actual actions to promote the spring ploughing and production high tide. At the same time, we should organize the militia to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fully playing the militia's role as the backbone and leader in production.

In supporting spring ploughing and production, we must always maintain revolutionary vigilance and guard against the class enemies' sabotage activities. We should firmly stand on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants, expose and counter the class enemies' conspiracies in a timely manner, resolutely strike down the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who sabotage the cultural revolution in the countryside and production, and the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party in power, to protect spring ploughing and production and protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The countryside is a great classroom for class struggle and production struggle. In supporting spring ploughing and production, we should, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, humbly learn from the local areas, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and together with the masses, in the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise proletarian awareness, and promote the revolutionization of thought.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out the instructions of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Military Commission, and in the struggle to seize victory in spring ploughing and production, make due contributions to the socialist construction of our motherland and to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    大力支援革命农民掀起春耕生产高潮
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央向全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部，发出了响亮的号召，要求大家认真地抓革命，促生产，动员一切力量，立即掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产的高潮。同时，号召人民解放军当地部队和各级军事机关大力支持、帮助春耕生产工作。中央军委发出指示，要求我军广大指战员迅速行动起来，热烈响应毛主席和党中央的号召，积极帮助驻地人民公社狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取春耕生产的胜利而奋斗。
    今年的春天，是全国全面展开阶级斗争的春天。无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，以锐不可挡之势，从城市卷向广大农村。广大革命农民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，大造一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造坚持反动立场的地富反坏右分子的反。农村文化大革命的形势好得很！但是，阶级敌人并不甘心自己的失败，他们还在使用种种阴谋手段，兴风作浪。在当前，他们妄图通过破坏春耕生产，达到破坏我国社会主义经济，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋，搞好春耕生产，夺取今年农业丰收，对促进整个社会主义建设事业的发展，对保证无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，具有十分重要的意义。
    毛主席号召我们：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。我军永远是一个战斗队，又是工作队、生产队。做群众工作，支援群众生产，是我军的光荣传统。在目前这场夺取春耕生产胜利的斗争中，在这个争分夺秒的紧迫时刻，我们义不容辞，应该挺身而出，尽一切可能，支援农村人民公社，搞好春耕生产。这也是对左派广大群众的一种最实际、最有力的支持。
    我们支援春耕生产，最重要的是要当好毛泽东思想宣传队。要通过各种形式，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大战略意义。要向人民公社各级干部宣传正确地对待群众的批评，要向贫下中农宣传正确地对待有缺点错误的干部，促使一切贫下中农和其他劳动农民，一切革命的干部，一切犯有错误但决心改正错误的干部，在毛泽东思想的指导下，团结起来，共同闹革命，合力促生产，响应毛主席和党中央的号召，胜利完成春耕生产的光荣任务。
    我们还要不失时机，用劳力、技术力量，大力支援农村人民公社的春耕生产，充分发挥部队在生产中的突击作用。我们在生产劳动中，要不怕苦，不怕累，拣重担子挑，和群众打成一片，做抓革命、促生产的模范，用实际行动促进春耕生产的高潮。同时，要认真组织民兵活学活用毛主席著作，充分发挥民兵在生产中的骨干带头作用。
    我们在支援春耕生产中，必须时刻保持革命警惕，严防阶级敌人的破坏活动。要坚定地站在贫下中农一边，及时揭穿和反击阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，坚决打击破坏农村文化大革命、破坏生产的地富反坏右分子和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，保卫春耕生产，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    农村是阶级斗争的大课堂，生产斗争的大课堂。我们在支援春耕生产中，要按照林彪同志的指示，虚心向地方学习，向贫下中农和革命干部学习，同群众一起，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，提高无产阶级觉悟，促进思想革命化。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席、党中央和中央军委的指示，在夺取春耕生产胜利的斗争中，为祖国的社会主义建设，为无产阶级文化大革命，作出应有的贡献。
                                  （二月二十五日）
