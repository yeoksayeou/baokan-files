Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people of all China and the people of the whole world. The workers and experts sent by our country to various friendly nations to aid in economic construction, following Chairman Mao's teachings, take proletarian internationalism as their guiding principle and wholeheartedly serve the people of the countries where they are stationed. They share weal and woe with the local laboring people, take their work seriously and responsibly, and impart their skills without reservation to the people of the aided countries. They have won the enthusiastic praise of the people of these countries.

They study and apply Chairman Mao's works earnestly, striving to transform both the objective world and their subjective selves. Therefore, they possess the greatest wisdom, courage, and perseverance, and can overcome any difficulty and accomplish any arduous task.

They are warriors of internationalism nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Not only do they sincerely help the people of various countries in their construction efforts, but they also enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Wherever they go, they bring Mao Zedong Thought with them.

Ten years ago, Chairman Mao said: "China should make greater contributions to humanity." Today, revolutionary people all over the world place their hopes in the Chinese people. We should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, be even more modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and better serve the people of the world, making greater contributions to the world revolution.

    毛泽东思想哺育的国际主义战士
    毛主席教导我们要为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。我国派往各友好国家帮助经济建设的工人和专家，根据毛主席的教导，把无产阶级国际主义作为自己行动的准则，全心全意地为所在国的人民服务。他们和当地的劳动人民同甘共苦，在工作中认真负责，把自己的技术毫无保留地传授给受援国的人民，赢得了这些国家的人民的热烈赞扬。
    他们活学活用毛主席著作，在改造客观世界的同时，努力改造主观世界。所以，他们能够有最大的智慧、勇气和毅力，再大的困难也能克服，再艰巨的任务也能完成。
    他们是毛泽东思想哺育成长的国际主义战士。他们不但真诚地帮助各国人民建设，而且还热情地宣传毛泽东思想，他们走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想带到哪里。
    毛主席在十年以前说过：“中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。”今天，全世界革命人民都把希望寄托在中国人民身上。我们应当按照毛主席的教导，更加谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，更好地为世界人民服务，对世界革命事业作出更大的贡献。
