	Regarding Several Regulations on Mass Organizations Infiltrated and Seized by the Demonic Elements in Society

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 4 — Notice from the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Proletariat in Guizhou

	Regarding Several Regulations on Mass Organizations Infiltrated and Seized by the Demonic Elements in Society

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, many revolutionary mass organizations have emerged, mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. The situation is excellent. However, recently, some demonic elements in society have taken advantage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to infiltrate revolutionary mass organizations, seize their leadership, deceive and manipulate the masses, sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, disrupt production, attack the People's Liberation Army, loot firearms and ammunition, steal state secrets, and engage in counter-revolutionary restoration. In view of this situation, the following regulations are hereby issued:

	1. The ringleaders and accomplices among the demonic elements who have infiltrated and seized the leadership of revolutionary mass organizations must be immediately arrested and prosecuted.

	2. For the general members of the reactionary cliques, those who confess will be treated leniently, those who resist will be treated severely, and those who perform meritorious deeds can have their crimes mitigated.

	3. For the small leaders in the reactionary cliques, those who voluntarily register and surrender, and do not continue to plot sabotage, will not be arrested or humiliated.

	4. For the masses who have been deceived and manipulated by the demonic elements, no responsibility will be pursued. The policy of unity and education will be adopted to help them quickly awaken, open their eyes, distinguish between enemies and friends, completely break with those bad elements, unite around the revolutionary rebels, and resolutely expose and fight against those bad elements.

	5. The broad masses of revolutionary people must remember Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must use the perspective of class analysis to deal with all mass organizations and their actions, ensuring that the leadership of mass organizations is firmly in the hands of the genuine revolutionary leftists, and resolutely expel the demonic elements that have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought must be firmly supported, and whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought must be firmly resisted and opposed.

	6. For counter-revolutionary cliques that use participation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a cover, they must be resolutely suppressed.

	For organizations and hooligan gangs that use participation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a cover and engage solely in economic struggles, they must be ordered to disband. If they refuse to disband, the revolutionary rebels will take all necessary actions.

    关于被社会上的牛鬼蛇神打入和篡夺领导权的群众组织的若干规定
    新华社贵阳四日电　贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部通告
    关于被社会上的牛鬼蛇神打入和篡夺领导权的群众组织的若干规定
    无产阶级文化大革命中，在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下，出现了许多革命群众组织，把广大革命群众的革命积极性调动起来了。形势大好。但是，最近社会上的一些牛鬼蛇神，趁无产阶级文化大革命之机，打入革命群众组织，篡夺其领导权，欺骗和操纵群众，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏生产，冲击我人民解放军，抢劫枪枝弹药，盗窃国家机密，搞反革命复辟。鉴于这种情况，特作以下规定：
    一、对打入革命群众组织、篡夺领导权的牛鬼蛇神中的首要分子及其死党，必须立即逮捕法办。
    二、对其反动集团指挥部的一般成员，坦白者从宽，抗拒者从严，立功者可将功折罪。
    三、参加反动集团的小头目，凡自动投诚登记、不再阴谋破坏者，一律不加逮捕，不加侮辱。
    四、对被牛鬼蛇神操纵的组织中受蒙蔽欺骗的群众，概不追究，采取团结教育的方针，使他们迅速觉悟过来，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，与那些坏蛋彻底决裂，团结在革命造反派的周围，对那些坏蛋坚决进行揭露和斗争。
    五、广大革命群众应该牢记毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中必须以阶级分析的观点来对待所有群众组织及其行动，保证把群众组织的领导权牢牢掌握在真正革命左派手中，坚决清除混入革命队伍中的牛鬼蛇神。凡符合毛泽东思想的就坚决支持，凡违背毛泽东思想的就坚决抵制和反对。
    六、对以参加无产阶级文化大革命为幌子组成的反革命集团，坚决予以镇压。
    对以参加无产阶级文化大革命为幌子，组成的专搞经济斗争的组织和流氓集团，一律勒令解散，如若拒不解散，革命造反派将采取一切必要的行动。
        贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部
                  一九六七年一月三十日
