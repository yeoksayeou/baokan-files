Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper publishes a big-character poster by the Lu Xun Brigade of the Revolutionary Rebel Command of Shanghai's Sports Front, titled "Where is the Lu Xun Brigade Going?" At the same time, we also publish an article by the editorial board of Shanghai's "Sports Front News," titled "Cheering for the Little Red Guards' Big-Character Poster." These two articles raise important issues that need to be urgently addressed in the process of the proletarian revolutionary struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, after achieving initial victories. These two articles are excellent examples of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The big-character poster calls for fighting while rectifying, and it is very timely and well-reasoned in proposing that the main problems within the proletarian revolutionary camp should be solved through rectification methods, consciously solving problems from the ideological level. These two articles are worth the attention of proletarian revolutionaries across the country, who should study and research them seriously in conjunction with their own specific situations.

The wheels of history roll forward!

Under the personal leadership and guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing more deeply and broadly. Currently, the proletarian revolutionaries, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have achieved great unity and, with an irresistible momentum, are waging a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have seized the party power, state power, and economic power that these individuals usurped, firmly grasping the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the fate of the socialist economy in their own hands. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage, and the revolutionary situation is excellent and getting better!

Facing this excellent new situation, we look back on the Cultural Revolution in the sports system. In just eight short months, the proletarian revolutionaries have experienced such tremendous storms! In the days of dark winds and white terror, we have endured insults and attacks; we have experienced threats and suppression. Because we wrote "Twenty Points on the Directional and Line Errors of the Branch Committee," countless big-character posters from the branch committee organizations rained down on us; what was said about not wanting the leadership of the branch committee was "not wanting the leadership of the Party," "attacking the proletarian headquarters," what was said about seizing the broadcasting station was "rebelling against the proletariat," what was said about opening the gate was "defying the central instructions," what was said about the "ghost-catching team" catching "ghosts"! And so on. The arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries was so rampant. At that time, it was like "dark clouds pressing down on the city, ready to collapse." But we laughed in the face of the storm, faced the obstacles head-on. Chairman Mao's warm teachings gave us boundless strength. With Chairman Mao supporting us, no matter how fiercely the enemy suppressed us, we stood tall and shouted loudly. "'Lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot,' this is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools." Those handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are just such a bunch of fools. "All the persecutions they inflicted on the revolutionary people ultimately only promoted a broader and more violent revolution." The revolutionary forces in the sports system have come together! The Lu Xun Brigade was established in the great struggle between the two lines, two destinies, and two futures in the sports system. From the moment it appeared, it showed an extraordinary vitality. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, we carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Lu Xun, fearing neither isolation nor threats, neither attacks nor slander, neither open nor covert arrows, neither the "counter-revolutionary" hat nor losing our heads, fighting to the death with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, making those handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road tremble with fear, and making those confused comrades stare in disbelief. In the great struggle between the two lines in the sports system, the Lu Xun Brigade became the vanguard of defending and executing the proletarian revolutionary line, becoming the backbone of the revolutionary rebellion in the sports system. Under the guidance of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, the Lu Xun Brigade grew stronger and more victorious in the struggle, rapidly developing and achieving one great victory after another. Recently, the revolutionary forces represented by the Lu Xun Brigade have taken over the official seal of the sports system and seized the power of the handful of power-holders within the branch committee who are taking the capitalist road. This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has developed into a new stage. Now, history has presented the proletarian revolutionaries with higher demands and new problems.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because of victory, arrogance within the Party, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, the tendency to stop and not seek progress, the tendency to enjoy pleasures and not want to live a hard life may grow. Because of victory, the people will thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to praise us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The praise of the bourgeoisie, however, may conquer the weak-willed among our ranks. There may be some communists who have not been conquered by the enemy with guns, who are truly heroes in the face of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the sugar-coated bullets, they will be defeated in the face of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." Examining the internal situation of the Lu Xun Brigade, in the recent period, some new problems have indeed emerged, and some erroneous tendencies have appeared. Now, the "Red East" Combat Team will attempt to share some of our views and discuss them with comrades and fellow fighters.

Oppose the Pure Military Viewpoint, Emphasize Ideological Revolution

The pure military viewpoint has developed quite seriously among some comrades in the Lu Xun Brigade (including some leading comrades). The main manifestation of this pure military viewpoint is that all attention and energy are focused on "exposing ×××," "smashing ×××," "removing ×××," "overthrowing ×××," mistakenly understanding that the ultimate goal of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is simply to expose some revisionist counter-revolutionaries. It seems that if a batch is exposed, a batch is overthrown, and a batch is removed, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will have achieved "complete" victory, and China will not change color. This pure "military viewpoint" has led to an erroneous tendency within the Lu Xun Brigade to fight simply for the sake of fighting, to overthrow simply for the sake of overthrowing. This has caused some comrades in the Lu Xun Brigade to neglect the ideological revolution, neglect the political and ideological education of cadres and the masses, and also relax their own political learning and ideological transformation. This pure "military viewpoint" is closely related to various non-proletarian thoughts reflected within the Lu Xun Brigade, such as individualism, liberalism, factionalism, and seeking fame.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Red Army's fighting is not purely for the sake of fighting, but to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses build revolutionary political power. Without these goals, fighting loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its meaning." Comrades with a pure "military viewpoint" have not yet fully understood the great and far-reaching significance of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has swept the nation and shaken the world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul, not some "revolution of demotion." Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest revolution of the 1960s, the most extensive, profound, and largest-scale revolutionary mass movement in history, an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. It is a great revolution to transform people's souls and promote the revolutionization of people's thoughts. The fundamental task of this great revolutionary movement is to oppose revisionism, prevent revisionism, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, thoroughly destroy the social base of revisionist counter-revolutionaries and eliminate their ideological influence, firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, and deeply root Mao Zedong Thought; at the same time, it is also to temper and cultivate a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. While the pure "military viewpoint," the pure demotion, and the erroneous tendency of fighting simply for the sake of fighting will only make this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution go through the motions, the result being that while the organization demotes revisionist officials, in thought they are not demoted. The soil of revisionism still exists, and while one revisionist counter-revolutionary is overthrown, another will rise up, and even one might execute the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. If this continues, capitalism may re-emerge, and the proletarian regime may still change color. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological realm will take a fairly long time to resolve.... If one does not have a sufficient understanding of this situation, or does not recognize it at all, then one will commit a great error and will neglect the necessary ideological struggle." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Lu Xun Brigade is on the side of Chairman Mao, on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line. However, every warrior in the Lu Xun Brigade should see that the leadership of the sports system has been walking the capitalist road for more than a decade, implementing a whole set of revisionist lines. In this "comfortable nest" of revisionism, our comrades have more or less been influenced by revisionism and more or less have various bourgeois ideological consciousness. The worldview of the broad masses and our own still needs to be thoroughly transformed. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul. What is the soul? The soul is thought, it is worldview. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great ideological revolution, not just a "revolution of demotion." In the movement, we must emphasize politics and oppose the pure "military viewpoint." In addition, for ourselves, in the days of white terror under the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, we, the revolutionary minority, touched our own souls and came through. Today, when the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao is heading towards comprehensive and thorough victory, we must study Chairman Mao's works even more, thoroughly touch our own souls, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and transform our thoughts. 1967 is a year of comprehensive class struggle across the country. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget to emphasize politics, and while transforming the objective world, transform the subjective world. In the great waves of class struggle, in the sword and fire of the masses' struggle, we will fall, struggle, roll, and crawl, determined to be a strong successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The revolutionary Lu Xun Brigade should be an indomitable, unyielding, and strong fighting force, and even more so a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and a great furnace for the proletarian revolution.

Oppose "Materialism," Fight a "People's War"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history."

Chairman Mao also says: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war."

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the most extensive, profound, and largest-scale revolutionary mass movement in history, a new stage of our country's socialist revolution. To achieve great victory, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and rely on the conscious actions of hundreds of millions of people, fight a "people's war," and thoroughly, deeply, and completely expose all revisionist thoughts and various manifestations of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie; only in this way can we thoroughly expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and seize the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Checking the internal situation of the Lu Xun Brigade, some comrades have the erroneous tendency of "materialism" and "materialism only." Comrade Lin Biao says: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong at the helm, the workers, peasants, and soldiers have always been the main force of our country's revolution. Today, they are the main force of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and they are also the main force of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." To do a good job in this movement, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the wisdom and strength of the broad masses, while those who emphasize materialism say: "Doing a good job in this movement relies on materials, relying on 'insiders' to expose," "materials are the most important, with materials everything is easy!" Such people even ask in a serious manner, "Without materials, how can we carry out the movement?" and so on. Under the guidance of this thought, some comrades have become obsessed with materials, concentrating their energy on materials, and thinking they are "heroes" and "good guys" and "insiders" once they have some materials. In this way, the masses can only follow behind, listen to reports, shout slogans, and boost morale, and the masses will unconsciously have to obey the "material holders," while the leadership of the core group also becomes "powerless" and "helpless." How can the broad masses learn to swim in the swimming and learn to fight in the struggle? How can they be tempered, raise their consciousness, give full play to their initiative, and increase their abilities in the movement?

The fallacy and practice of "materialism" and "materialism only" completely contradict Chairman Mao's thought of the people's war. It removes the soul of the "Sixteen Articles"—trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses to let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves in the struggle, let the masses be tempered in the struggle, distinguish right from wrong, increase their abilities, and implement a substitute.

There is this erroneous tendency within the Lu Xun Brigade. Comrades must be vigilant and correct it as soon as possible!

Thoroughly Smash Counter-Revolutionary Economism, Save for the Revolution

Chairman Mao says: "Embezzlement and waste are great crimes."

Chairman Mao also teaches us: "In any place, we must cherish manpower and material resources, and we must not just think of the moment and waste them."

The counter-revolutionary wind of economism has also blown into our revolutionary ranks, and some comrades, under the influence of this sweet wind, have begun to "improve"! They have been hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemy and have begun to enjoy the fruits of their past achievements.

This unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to uproot the roots of revisionism. We revolutionaries must not be careless! A true revolutionary warrior, no matter the conditions, must absolutely not waste state property. Being extravagant, showing off, and pursuing the bourgeois way of life are incompatible with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If this develops, it will lead to the bourgeois trap. Wasting state property is a crime against the people!

Some of our comrades are a bit different now from before. They pursue motorcycles, telephones, bicycles; they are not frugal with state paper, spending lavishly, thinking that a little waste is no big deal. At night, they don't go to bed early, insisting on staying up late, going to the canteen for late-night snacks, and eating very well. The oil in the fried rice is so much that it's unbelievable, some even fry the oil-soaked rice, fry eggs, and say: "Building a tennis court wasted 20,000 yuan, what's the big deal? What's so special about an egg?" Should such words come from the mouth of a revolutionary? In terms of living standards and material requirements, they have also increased. Many people have borrowed overcoats as if they were their own private property, wearing them every day, and so on. Many examples can illustrate that the Lu Xun Brigade has such erroneous tendencies. If this is allowed to develop, our revolutionary spirit will weaken and even completely disappear, and we will fall into the trap of revisionist economism.

There are not a few examples of those who, having been hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, have become corrupt and degenerate in their lives and politically degenerate. This lesson must never be forgotten. Revolutionary comrades, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and insist on "saving for the revolution." Only in this way can we stand firm politically, only in this way can we gain the support of the broad masses, and only in this way can we always maintain and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Frugality is the nature of the proletarian revolutionaries. We have withstood the test of counter-revolutionary attacks, and we should also withstand the test of counter-revolutionary economism.

Oppose Exclusivism, Unite with the Majority

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution."

Chairman Mao also teaches us: "True successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause must be able to unite the vast majority of people to work together. They must not only be good at uniting those who agree with them but also be good at uniting those who disagree with them, and even those who have opposed them but have been proven wrong by practice. However, we must be especially vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev and prevent such bad people from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at all levels."

The proletarian revolutionaries, in the days of suppression, to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, launched a fierce counterattack against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They faced heavy resistance and various pressures from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the old social forces of habit, and in the white terror, they fought a hard struggle and temporarily stood in the glorious minority.

Now, the situation is developing rapidly. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved victory. The proletarian revolutionaries have risen up, and the "Red Guard Brigade," "Red Guard Brigade," "Revolutionary Field Army," "July 1st Red Guards" and other "conservative" organizations in the sports system have all collapsed. Those who opposed and attacked us in the past, the majority of the conservative masses, have realized their mistakes and gradually seen through the true face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the leaders who insist on the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and have risen up to rebel. How should we treat them now?

Here, some of our comrades think that they have achieved results in their past rebellions and have become arrogant, considering themselves old revolutionaries, looking down on others, and adopting exclusivism towards those who have made mistakes but are determined to correct them and hope to join the fight, even treating them as "opportunists" and "straw-clutchers," kicking them out of the door. Some comrades, under the pretext of "seeking unity in struggle," direct their guns at the deceived masses, firing continuously, but let off the main responsible persons who implemented the wrong line... These are several extremely dangerous tendencies that must be overcome within our Lu Xun Brigade.

For those who were deceived in the past, we must see that the majority of people still want revolution. They wavered and were not firm in their stance in the great waves of class struggle in the previous period, adopting a conservative attitude. Now, they have gradually realized their mistakes and returned to the correct line. For these comrades, we should enthusiastically help them realize that they stood on the wrong side and went in the wrong direction in the past, realize the root of their mistakes; for these comrades, we should actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, so that they deeply understand the great significance of this great revolution that touches people's souls, see more clearly the essence of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, unite with them, and jointly participate in the fight. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution must adopt the strategy of developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and opposing diehard forces. These are three inseparable links." We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's teachings, develop and strengthen the leftist forces, win over the intermediate forces, unite with the majority, and concentrate our forces to strike and isolate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Uniting with the majority is for the revolution, and doing the revolution must unite with the majority. This is an important strategic thought of Chairman Mao, and this is a major issue that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must pay attention to. "Not understanding how to unite with the majority, one cannot achieve revolutionary victory. This is what our party's decades of revolutionary practice has proven. Not paying attention to uniting with the majority may lead the movement astray, may direct the struggle against the masses, and may commit directional and line errors. This is what the countless facts of the past half-year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have repeatedly proven."

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao requires us to prevent sectarianism and exclusivism. Chairman Mao calls the strategy of exclusivism the strategy of being alone, the strategy of relying on lone warriors. While the strategy of the proletariat is the opposite, it is to "recruit a large number of troops to surround and annihilate the enemy."

Let us raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with the broad masses, follow the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, form a vast army of cultural revolution, and seize the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Rectify Thoughts, Attack the "Self"

Previously, the "Red East" Combat Team discussed some of our shallow views on the erroneous tendencies and thoughts that exist within the Lu Xun Brigade. Now, we ask: How did these erroneous tendencies and thoughts arise? What is their essence? Some say: "These are internal trivial matters." Some say: "These are our work methods and strategies." Some also say: "These are issues of struggle tactics." We do not agree with these views. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and new and old things within the Party." Chairman Mao also says: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are inevitably stamped with the mark of class." From the various erroneous tendencies and thoughts reflected within the Lu Xun Brigade, fundamentally, it is the struggle between the two lines and the struggle between two different worldviews. We must use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, not the viewpoint of metaphysics and vulgarity, to look at these problems.

In mass movements, especially in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, within the Lu Xun Brigade, there is a struggle between the two lines and the struggle between two worldviews. This is not surprising. Chairman Mao says: "The bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, their ideological consciousness will definitely be reflected. They will definitely use various methods to stubbornly express themselves in political and ideological issues. To make them not reflect and not express themselves is impossible." In October, the Lu Xun Brigade was suppressed and attacked, and the need for struggle tightly united them. At that time, the struggle between the two thoughts and the two worldviews within the brigade was not manifested due to the main contradiction. Now that the ranks have expanded and the struggle has achieved victory, the hidden sectarianism, liberalism, factionalism, cliquism, extremist democracy, and seeking fame within the Lu Xun Brigade have gradually been exposed. The struggle between the two thoughts and the two worldviews within the Lu Xun Brigade on how to deal with the masses and the line struggle has emerged. Some comrades have relaxed their study of Mao Zedong Thought, relaxed the arduous transformation of their souls, relaxed the attack on "self," and slept on their past "struggle history" and "great victories," gradually weakening their past fearless and towering spirit, weakening their past daring to fight, dare to charge, dare to kill, and dare to see blood. Some comrades do not have a thorough mass viewpoint, do not wholeheartedly serve the people, and are not willing to be the students of the masses, but instead have a pure "military viewpoint," "materialism," neglecting political and ideological revolution, gradually alienating themselves from the broad masses and the comrades who have fought side by side with them, only liking flattery and not liking criticism, and the tiger's buttocks cannot be touched; some comrades are only good at charging and killing, but do not want to do painstaking and meticulous work; some people continue to consider themselves the "minority," excluding those who have realized their mistakes, are determined to correct them, and hope to join the fight from the door... All of this is contrary to Mao Zedong Thought; all of this is incompatible with the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Fundamentally, it is the bourgeois "self" that is at work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We carry out rectification, now carry out rectification, and will carry out rectification in the future, to constantly remove the erroneous things within us, so that we can better undertake this task and better work together with all reform-minded gentlemen outside the Party." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only uses Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the old world and smash the old world but also must cultivate and organize a vast army of cultural revolutionaries who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, extremely proletarianized, and extremely militant. Without such a vast army of cultural revolution, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot achieve final victory. Now, the historical task of uniting with the broad masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and achieve the final victory of the cultural revolution has honorably fallen on the shoulders of us proletarian revolutionaries. Our Lu Xun Brigade must carry out ideological and organizational rectification. Without rectifying an extremely proletarianized, extremely militant revolutionary leftist force, it is impossible to complete this glorious historical task.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Party, our ranks, although most of them are pure, in order to better lead the revolutionary movement to develop and complete it more quickly, we must seriously rectify ourselves ideologically and organizationally. And in order to rectify organizationally, we must first rectify ideologically, and carry out a struggle between proletarian and non-proletarian ideologies." Currently, the Lu Xun Brigade urgently needs rectification and urgently needs an "open-door rectification." That is, through the study of Chairman Mao's works (mainly the "Three Articles," "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party," "Against Liberalism," "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Reissue the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention," etc.), each person or combat team should expose their thoughts, present their views, and lay out their problems, and broadly listen to the opinions of the masses, further expose the problems we have, and clarify the targets and directions of future struggles. In the rectification, the core group of the brigade, various organizations and combat teams, columns, and combat groups should burn themselves, actively carry out criticism and self-criticism, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and timely correct their own shortcomings and errors.

We believe that since it is an "open-door rectification," the door should be opened wider, completely open, without hiding and fearing "family shame." Chairman Mao says: "A thorough materialist is fearless," "The Communist Party is not afraid of criticism, because we are Marxists, truth is on our side, and the basic masses of workers and peasants are on our side." The Lu Xun Brigade is revolutionary, it cannot be rectified, and if it is not revolutionary, it deserves to be rectified. This is our attitude. Now, some people say to stop the battle to rectify and then fight, and some say to fight this battle and then rectify. We say, fight while rectifying. The experience of our Party's rectification movement in 1942 and the rectification movement in 1957 proves that fighting while rectifying is not only possible but also has very good results. Our Lu Xun Brigade can also implement this. Doing so, our Lu Xun Brigade will definitely become stronger and more prosperous.

Where is the Lu Xun Brigade going? The "Red East" Combat Team firmly believes that although the Lu Xun Brigade will still face countless storms and sudden storms, and there will still be twists and turns, under the leadership and support of the great teacher Chairman Mao, and under the radiance of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, the broad revolutionary warriors of the Lu Xun Brigade will definitely be able to overcome all obstacles and advance victoriously along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

Down with "self," victory will definitely belong to the revolutionary Lu Xun Brigade!

    上海体育战线革命造反司令部鲁迅兵团东方红战斗队的一张大字报：
    我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？
    编者按：今天，本报刊登上海体育战线革命造反司令部鲁迅兵团东方红战斗队的一张大字报，《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》。同时，刊登上海《体育战报》评论员的文章，《为“东方红”小将的一张大字报叫好》。这两篇文章，提出了在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的过程中，在取得初步胜利之后，带有普遍性的、迫切需要解决的、关系革命事业继续前进的极其重要的问题。这两篇文章是活学活用毛主席著作的好范例。大字报提出了一边战斗、一边整风的号召。他们提出的无产阶级革命派内部当前存在的主要问题，主张运用整风方法，自觉地从思想上解决问题，都讲得很好，很及时。这两篇文章，值得全国各地无产阶级革命派的同志们注意，并结合自己单位的具体情况，认真地学习和研究。
    历史的车轮滚滚向前！
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导下，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在更深入，更广阔地向前发展。当前，无产阶级革命派遵循毛主席的伟大教导实现大联合，以排山倒海之势，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了夺权斗争，把他们窃取的党权，政权，财权统统夺过来了，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，无产阶级专政的命运，社会主义经济的命运，紧紧地掌握在无产阶级革命派自己的手中了。无产阶级文化大革命已进入一个崭新的阶段，革命的形势好得很！越来越好！
    面临大好的新形势，我们回顾运动系文化大革命，短短的八个月的时间里，无产阶级革命派经历了多大的惊涛骇浪啊！在阴风四起，白色恐怖的日子里，围攻谩骂，我们受过；威胁压制，我们领教过。因为写“总支犯方向性、路线性错误的二十点”，多少张总支组织的大字报铺天盖地向我们压过来；什么不要总支的领导是“不要党的领导”、“炮打无产阶级司令部”啊，什么抢广播站是“造无产阶级的反”啊，什么开大门是“违抗中央指示”啊，什么捉鬼队的捉“鬼”啊！等等。反革命的气焰是何等的嚣张。当时正是“黑云压城城欲摧”。而我们却迎着风暴笑，迎着阻力上，毛主席的亲切教导，给了我们无穷无尽的力量，有毛主席支持我们，无论敌人怎么疯狂地镇压我们，我们照样顶天立地，我们照样大喊大叫。“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。”那些党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就是这样的一批蠢人。“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”运动系的革命派走到一起来了！鲁迅兵团在运动系两条路线，两种命运，两种前途的大决战中成立了！他们一出现就表现了无比强大的生命力。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，我们发扬了鲁迅的革命造反精神，不怕孤立，不怕威胁，不怕围攻，不怕造谣中伤，不怕明枪暗箭，不怕戴“反革命”帽子，不怕丢脑袋，与一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作了拚死的斗争，使那些党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派闻风丧胆，使那些糊涂的同志目瞪口呆。在运动系两条路线斗争的大搏斗，大决战中，鲁迅兵团成了运动系保卫和执行无产阶级革命路线的急先锋，成了运动系革命造反的骨干力量。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，鲁迅兵团在斗争中发展壮大，迅速成长，取得了一个又一个的巨大胜利。最近以鲁迅兵团为代表的革命派又接管了运动系的大印，夺了总支内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一个伟大胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命已经发展到了一个崭新的阶段，现在，历史向我们无产阶级革命派又提出了更高要求，又把新的问题推到了无产阶级革命派的面前。
    毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”检查我们鲁迅兵团内部，在最近一个阶段，确实产生了一些新的问题，出现了一些错误的思想倾向。现在，我们“东方红”战斗队尝试谈谈自己的几点看法，和同志们、战友们一起讨论。
    反对单纯军事观点，突出思想革命
    单纯的军事观点，在鲁迅兵团的部分同志（包括有些领导同志）中发展得比较厉害。这种单纯的军事观点的主要表现，就是把目光和精力全集中在“揪出×××”“砸烂×××”“罢免×××”“打倒×××”上面，错误地理解这次无产阶级文化大革命最终目的单纯只是为了揪出一些反革命修正主义分子，似乎揪出一批，打倒一批，罢免一批，无产阶级文化大革命就取得了“彻底”胜利，中国就不会变颜色了。这种单纯的“军事观点”，使得我们鲁迅兵团内存在着一种单纯地为了“打仗”而“打仗”，为了打倒而打倒的错误倾向，使得鲁迅兵团内的有些同志，忽视了思想上的革命，忽视了对干部和群众的政治思想教育，并且也放松了自己的政治学习和思想改造。这种单纯的“军事观点”，是与鲁迅兵团内部反映出来的各种非无产阶级的思想，如个人主义，自由主义，山头主义，风头主义等都有着密切联系的。
    毛主席教导我们：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”具有单纯的“军事观点”的同志，实际上还没有完全理解这次磅礴全国，震动全世界的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大的深远的意义。无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，决不是什么“罢官革命”。我国的无产阶级文化大革命是二十世纪六十年代最伟大的革命，是历史上一次最广泛、最深刻、规模最大的革命的群众运动，是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，这是一场改造人的灵魂，促使人的思想革命化的大革命。这场伟大革命运动的根本任务就是反修、防修，彻底挖掉修正主义根子，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义的社会基础及肃清其思想影响，大立毛泽东思想，扎牢毛泽东思想的根子；同时，还要锻炼和造就一大批用毛泽东思想武装起来的坚定的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。而单纯的“军事观点”，单纯的罢官，单纯的为了“打仗”而“打仗”的错误倾向，只能使这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命走过场，其结果，是组织上罢了修正主义的官，而在思想上却没有罢他们的官，修正主义的土壤还是存在，反革命修正主义分子一个被打倒了，而第二个又会爬上来，甚至可能自己就会执行资产阶级反动路线。这样下去，资本主义还可能重新复辟，无产阶级的江山仍有变色的危险。毛主席教导我们：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。……如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们鲁迅兵团是站在毛主席这一边，站在无产阶级革命路线这一边的。但是，我们鲁迅兵团的每一个战士都应该看到，运动系的领导十几年来走的是资本主义道路，贯彻的是一整套修正主义的路线，在这个修正主义的“安乐窝”内，我们的同志或多或少潜移默化地接受了修正主义的影响，或多或少地存在着各种资产阶级思想意识。广大群众和我们自己的世界观，都还需要很好的改造。无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命。什么是灵魂？灵魂就是思想，就是世界观。这场无产阶级文化大革命，是一场伟大的思想革命，绝不是只是“罢官革命”。在运动中一定要突出政治、反对单纯“军事观点”。另外，对我们自己来说，在资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖的日子，我们革命的少数派触及了自己的灵魂，闯了过来。在今天，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线走向全面地彻底胜利的时候，我们更要学习毛主席著作，狠狠地触及自己的灵魂，破私立公，改造自己的思想。一九六七年是全国全面展开阶级斗争的一年，我们更要牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘突出政治，在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界。在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，在群众斗争的剑与火中跌、打、滚、爬，誓做一个坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    革命的鲁迅兵团应该是一个冲不垮，压不倒，坚强的战斗队，更应该是毛泽东思想的宣传队，活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，无产阶级革命的大熔炉。
    反对“材料挂帅”，打“人民战争”
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    毛主席又说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命是历史上一次最广泛、最深刻、规模最大的革命的群众运动，是我国社会主义革命的新阶段，要取得伟大胜利，只有依靠毛泽东思想，依靠亿万群众自觉地行动起来，打“人民战争”，才能把一切修正主义的思想，资产阶级反动路线的各种表现，充分地，深刻地揭露出来；才能把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派统统揪出来，才能把无产阶级文化大革命搞深、搞透、搞彻底。
    检查我们鲁迅兵团内部，在有些同志思想上存在着“材料挂帅”、唯材料论的错误倾向。林彪同志说：“在毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下的工农兵群众，从来就是我国革命的主力军。今天，他们是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主力军，也是我国无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。”搞好这场运动，我们靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是广大群众的智慧和力量，而材料挂帅和唯材料论者，单纯地强调材料，说什么：“搞好这场运动靠材料，要靠‘知情者’来揭”“材料最重要，有材料就一切都好办！”这种人还煞有介事地反问什么“没有材料怎么搞运动”等等。在这种思想指导下，于是有些同志就热衷于材料，集中精力搞材料，掌握一些材料就自以为“英雄”“好汉”“知情者”，这样群众当然只能跟在后面听听报告，喊喊口号，助助声势，这样群众无形中一切只能听命于“材料占有者”，而核心小组的领导也成了“有职无权”、“鞭长莫及”了。广大群众，还怎么能在游泳中学会游泳，在斗争中学会斗争呢？还怎么能够在运动中得到锻炼，提高觉悟，发挥积极性，增长才干呢？
    “材料挂帅”和唯材料论的谬论和做法，完全违背了毛主席的人民战争思想，它抽掉了十六条的灵魂——信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，让群众在斗争中自己教育自己，自己解放自己，让群众在斗争中得到锻炼，辨别是非，增长才干，而实行了包办代替。
    鲁迅兵团内有这种错误倾向，同志们务必引起警惕，及早改正啊！
    彻底粉碎反革命经济主义，节约闹革命
    毛主席说：“贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。”
    毛主席又教导我们：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”
    反革命经济主义的妖风也刮进了我们革命派的内部，有些同志在这些香风的熏陶下，开始“修”起来了！他们中了阶级敌人的糖衣炮弹，开始躺在以前的成绩上，享起福来了。
    这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要挖修正主义的根子，我们革命派的每一个战士万万不可粗心大意啊！一个真正的革命战士，不论在什么条件下，绝对不应该浪费国家财产。讲阔气，讲排场，追求资产阶级那一套，这是和无产阶级文化大革命水火不相容的。如果发展下去，就会堕落到资产阶级的陷阱里去。任意挥霍国家的财物，就是对人民犯罪！
    我们有些同志现在和以前有点两样了。他们追求摩托车、电话、自行车；对于国家的纸张很不节约，大手大脚，认为浪费一点没多大关系。晚上无事也不早点睡觉，硬要呆到很晚，到食堂去吃晚点心，并吃得很好，炒饭的油真是多得使人不敢相信，有的甚至油氽锅巴，炒蛋，并说：“造网球场浪费了二万元也没有什么，一只蛋有什么稀奇。”这种话难道是应该出于一个革命派战士之口的吗？在生活上、物质上要求也高了，很多人都借了棉大衣，仿佛是自己的私物一样，平时也穿着，如此等等。许多事例可以说明鲁迅兵团已经有了这样的错误倾向。如果任其发展下去，我们的革命性就会要削弱以致完全消失，而走向修正主义的经济主义邪路。
    由于被资产阶级糖衣炮弹打中，而在生活上腐化堕落的，在政治上蜕化变质的例子，是不少的。这种教训是永远也不能忘记的。革命的同志们，我们必须听毛主席的话，坚持“要节约闹革命。”只有这样，才能在政治上立于不败之地，只有这样，才能得到广大群众的支持，也只有这样，才能永远保持和发扬无产阶级的革命精神。节约，是无产阶级革命派的本色。我们经受得住反革命围攻的考验，我们也应该经受得住反革命经济主义侵蚀的考验。
    反对关门主义，团结大多数
    毛主席教导我们说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    毛主席又教导我们：真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人“他们必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家。不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。但是，要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”
    无产阶级革命派，在受到压制的日子里，为了捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，向资产阶级反动路线进行了猛烈的反击，他们受到来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和旧的社会习惯势力的重重阻力和种种压力，在白色恐怖下进行了艰苦的斗争，暂时处于光荣的少数地位。
    现在，形势迅速发展，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了胜利。无产阶级革命派翻了身，运动系的保字号组织“红卫军团”、“赤卫军团”、“革命野战军”、“七一红卫兵”……个个土崩瓦解。过去反对过我们，围攻过我们的保守派中的大多数群众认识到了自己的错误，逐渐看清了那党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的负责人的真面目，纷纷起来造反了。这时，我们应该怎样对待他们呢？
    这里，我们有些同志认为自己过去造反有了成绩，就骄傲起来了，以老革命自居，轻视旁人，对犯过错误但决心改正，并希望参加战斗的群众采取关门主义，甚至把他们看作是“投机分子”、“捞稻草”，一脚踢在大门外。还有些同志以所谓“斗争中求团结”，把矛头指向受蒙蔽的群众，连连开炮，却放过了执行错误路线的主要负责人……这是几种极其危险的倾向，在我们鲁迅兵团内应该坚决克服。
    对于过去受蒙蔽的同志，我们一定要看到大多数人还是要革命的。他们在前个时期阶级斗争的大风大浪中动摇不定，立场不坚定，采取了保守的态度。现在，逐渐地认识到了自己的错误，回到正确路线上来了。对于这些同志我们应该热情地帮助他们，使他们认识到自己过去站错了立场，走错了方向，认识到自己犯错误的根源；对于这些同志，我们应该积极地向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，使他们深刻地理解到这场触及人们灵魂的大革命的伟大意义，更看清资产阶级反动路线的实质，团结他们，共同参加战斗。毛主席教导我们：革命“必须采取发展进步势力、争取中间势力、反对顽固势力的策略，这是不可分离的三个环节”。我们必须坚决执行毛主席的教导，发展壮大革命的左派队伍，争取中间派，团结大多数，集中力量打击、孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。团结大多数是为了革命，干革命必须团结大多数，这是毛主席的一个重要的战略思想，这是无产阶级文化大革命不可不注意的重大问题。“不懂得团结大多数，就不能获得革命的胜利，这是我们党几十年革命实践所证实的。不注意团结大多数，就可能把运动引向歧途，就可能把斗争矛头指向群众，就可能犯方向路线的错误，这是半年来无产阶级文化大革命的无数事实一再证实了的。”
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，要我们注意防止宗派主义，关门主义。毛主席把关门主义的策略，叫做孤家寡人的策略，叫做依靠单兵独马的策略。而无产阶级的策略相反，是“要招收广大的人马，好把敌人包围而消灭之。”
    让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，团结起广大群众，沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，组成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利吧！
    整顿思想，向“私”字开刀
    前面我们东方红战斗队针对我们鲁迅兵团内部存在的一些错误倾向和思想，谈了谈自己的粗浅的看法。现在，我们要问：这些错误的倾向和思想究竟是怎么产生的？其实质又是什么？有人说：“这是内部的枝节问题。”有人说：“这是我们的工作方法和策略问题。”也有人说：“这是斗争艺术的问题。”我们不同意这些观点。毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。”毛主席又说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”从鲁迅兵团内部反映出来的种种错误倾向和思想来看，归根结底，就是两条路线的斗争，两种不同世界观的斗争。我们必须用唯物辩证法的观点，而不能用形而上学的观点，庸人的观点看待这些问题。
    在群众运动中，特别是这场史无前例的触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，在鲁迅兵团内存在着两条路线的斗争，两种世界观的斗争，这并不奇怪。毛主席说：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。”在十月份，鲁迅兵团受到压制围攻，斗争的需要把他们紧紧地团结在一起了。当时内部两种思想，两种世界观的斗争，在主要矛盾面前，暂时没有表现出来。现在队伍扩大了，斗争取得胜利，在鲁迅兵团内隐藏着的关门主义，自由主义，山头主义，宗派主义，极端民主化，风头主义就渐渐地暴露出来了。在鲁迅兵团内对待群众，对待路线斗争问题的两种思想，两种世界观的斗争，就突现出来了。有些同志放松了对毛泽东思想的学习，放松了灵魂深处的刻苦改造，放松了向“私”字开火，躺在过去“斗争历史”“巨大胜利”上睡大觉，渐渐地他们减弱了过去叱咤风云，顶天立地的大无畏气概，减弱了过去敢拚，敢冲，敢杀，敢于刺刀见红的无产阶级革命造反精神。有些同志没有彻底的群众观点，不是全心全意地为人民服务，甘当群众的小学生，而是单纯“军事观点”，“材料挂帅”，忽视政治思想的革命，渐渐地脱离广大群众，脱离了曾经风雨同舟、并肩战斗的战友，只爱听恭维话，不爱听批评话，老虎屁股摸不得；有些同志只擅长于冲、杀，而不愿做艰苦细致的工作；有些人继续以“少数派”自居，把那些认识了错误，决心改正，希望参加战斗的同志，排斥在门外；……这一切都是同毛泽东思想相违背的；都是同以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线水火不相容的。归根结底，都是资产阶级的“私”字在作怪。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们所以要整风，现在要整风，将来还要整风，要不断地把我们身上的错误东西整掉，就是为了使我们能够更好地担负起这项任务，更好地同党外的一切立志改革的志士仁人共同工作。”无产阶级文化大革命不但要用毛泽东思想去批判旧世界、砸烂旧世界，同时必须造就、组织起一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，没有这样一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，无产阶级文化大革命就不能取得最后胜利。现在，团结起广大群众向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，夺取文化大革命的最后胜利的历史任务已经光荣地落在我们无产阶级革命派的肩上了，我们鲁迅兵团必须进行思想上和组织上的整顿，没有整顿起一支具有彻底的无产阶级革命精神，非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命左派队伍，是不可能完成这一光荣的历史任务的。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们的党，我们的队伍，虽然其中的大部分是纯洁的，但是为要领导革命运动更好地发展，更快地完成，就必须从思想上组织上认真地整顿一番。而为要从组织上整顿，首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。”目前鲁迅兵团急需整顿，并急需来个“开门整风”。就是说，通过毛主席著作学习（主要是“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》等），各人或各战斗队亮思想、摆观点、摊问题，并广泛听取群众的意见，进一步暴露我们存在的问题，明确今后斗争的目标和方向。在整风中兵团的核心小组，各级组织及各战斗队，纵队，战斗组应该引火烧身，积极开展批评和自我批评，虚心听取群众的意见，及时改正自己的缺点和错误。
    我们认为既然是“开门整风”，就要把门开得大一点，全部敞开，不要遮遮掩掩，不要怕“家丑”外扬。毛主席说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”、“共产党是不怕批评的，因为我们是马克思主义者，真理是在我们方面，工农基本群众是在我们方面。”鲁迅兵团是革命的，整不垮，不革命的，整垮活该。这就是我们的态度。现在有人说要把仗停下来整顿好再打，也有人说，打了这一仗再整顿。我们说，一边打仗，一边整风。我们党一九四二年的整风运动，一九五七年的整风运动的经验证明，一边战斗，一边整顿，不仅可以，而且效果很好。我们鲁迅兵团也完全可以实行。这样做，我们的鲁迅兵团一定会更加坚强，更加兴旺起来。
    鲁迅兵团向何处去？我们“东方红”战斗队坚信，鲁迅兵团虽然还要经过无数惊涛骇浪、暴风骤雨的冲击，虽然还会有曲折和反复，但在伟大导师毛主席的领导和支持下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，鲁迅兵团的广大革命派战士，一定能够排除一切障碍，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进！
    打倒“私”字，胜利一定属于革命的鲁迅兵团！
