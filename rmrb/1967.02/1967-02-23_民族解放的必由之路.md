The inevitable path to national liberation

Revolutionary people are unconquerable.

Two years ago, U.S. imperialism dispatched over thirty thousand invading troops to brutally suppress the armed uprising of the Dominican people, temporarily setting back the struggle of the Dominican people. However, it failed to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Dominican people. The Dominican people, armed, retreated from the cities to the countryside and continued their fight. The sparks of people's guerrilla warfare are now burning in the countryside of the Dominican Republic.

In a situation where powerful imperialism and its running dogs have long occupied the central cities, revolutionary forces rely on the vast peasantry, launch peasant guerrilla warfare, establish rural revolutionary bases, surround the cities from the countryside, accumulate strength, and ultimately seize the cities and the national power. This is the brilliant strategic thought of Chairman Mao, the inevitable path for oppressed nations to seek liberation.

Many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have used this strategic thought of Chairman Mao to wage people's wars and have achieved great victories in their struggles against imperialism and its running dogs.

As Chairman Mao pointed out two years ago in the "Statement Supporting the Dominican People's Struggle Against U.S. Armed Aggression," "As long as they rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in a protracted struggle, the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Dominican people, with the support of the people of the world, is bound to achieve final victory."

    民族解放的必由之路
    革命人民是征服不了的。
    美帝国主义在两年前出动了三万多侵略军，血腥镇压多米尼加人民的武装起义，使多米尼加人民的斗争遭到了暂时的挫折。但是，它并没有能够扑灭多米尼加人民的革命烈火，多米尼加人民带着武器从城市转入农村，坚持战斗。人民游击战争的星星之火，正在多米尼加的农村燃烧起来。
    在强大的帝国主义及其走狗长期地占据着中心城市的情况下，革命力量依靠广大农民，发动农民游击战争，建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，积蓄力量，最后夺取城市，夺取全国政权。这是毛主席的光辉的战略思想，是被压迫民族争取解放的必由之路。
    亚非拉许多国家争取民族独立和解放的人民，运用毛主席的这个战略思想，进行人民战争，已经在同帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利。
    正如毛主席两年前在《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》所指出的：“只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，多米尼加的反美爱国斗争，在全世界人民的支持下，是一定能够取得最后胜利的。”
