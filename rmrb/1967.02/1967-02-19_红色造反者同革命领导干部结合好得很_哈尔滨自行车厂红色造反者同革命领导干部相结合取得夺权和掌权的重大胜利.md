Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must pay full attention to this and must not be careless." The red rebels of the Harbin Bicycle Factory, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, in their struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, especially in this great struggle for power seizure, have followed the Party's policies and guidelines, strictly differentiated between enemies and friends, and united with revolutionary cadres who uphold the proletarian revolutionary line, achieving significant victories in power seizure and control.

One

In August 1966, the suppressed red rebels of the Harbin Bicycle Factory rose up in rebellion! On August 24, they established their own organization—the Harbin Bicycle Factory Red Rebel Corps—and launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were taken aback and immediately plotted to form "Eastern Wind," "Red Flag," and other conservative organizations to counter the rebel corps. Faced with this sharp and complex class struggle, Yu Zhiyuan, who had transferred from the military to the local area in 1958 and became the deputy director of the Harbin Bicycle Factory in 1965, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "no investigation, no right to speak" and studied "Investigation Report on the Hunan Peasant Movement." He conducted a series of investigations and studies from the family to society, from school to factory, and analyzed in detail the organizational members of various mass organizations, their political and economic status, and their actions. He discovered that those who joined the Red Rebel Corps in the factory were workers who were once called "hooligans" by the past "leaders." Under the oppression of the capitalist-roaders in power, they had no rights other than labor; while those who joined the conservative organizations were either deceived masses or the favorites of the capitalist-roaders in power. Looking at the general direction of the 88 Corps and the rebel corps: the rebel corps initially focused on fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; while the 88 Corps struck in all directions, not daring to direct the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the Party. All this made Yu Zhiyuan see clearly that the Red Rebel Corps were the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dared to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to rebel, and were a revolutionary organization full of vitality. Therefore, Yu Zhiyuan consciously and actively stood with the red rebels in thought, class sentiment, and action, and fought shoulder to shoulder with them!

Two

The Red Rebel Corps emerged from the white terror! On September 3, just ten days after the Red Rebel Corps was established, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory felt that their "hell" was unstable and jumped out, hastily convening a meeting of mid- and high-level cadres, using "self-immolation" as a pretext to actually eliminate the revolutionary leftist forces, plotting to merge all six organizations in the factory, thereby strangling the newly born Red Rebel Corps. At that time, the conservative organizations, which had an absolute numerical advantage, shouted "merge" in unison, desperately screaming with hoarse voices. However, the red rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought saw through this plot at a glance, exposed their tricks, and firmly opposed it! At this critical moment, Yu Zhiyuan stood up, standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly supporting the red rebels, and pointed out on the spot: "Whether to merge or not is the people's affair. The Central Committee has instructions, and the Sixteen Articles clearly stipulate 'to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the initiative of the masses.' The Red Rebel Corps is a minority, and the Sixteen Articles say to protect the minority because sometimes the truth is in the hands of a minority." His clear stance immediately met with the fierce opposition of the bourgeois gentlemen, and he was deprived of his right to speak, but he still insisted, "I have the right to reserve my opinion!"

"The deeper the oppression, the greater the resistance," the enemy must be "lifting a stone to drop on their own feet." The red rebels were fearless, bombarding the factory party committee, exposing the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line. The enemy was not willing to perish, and the stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line continued to plot and play tricks, forming a new "hell" of counter-revolutionaries—the temporary party committee. The temporary party committee sent two commissioners to control two elite guards—the Red Guards and the Red Army; the other two commissioners controlled two instruments of dictatorship—the armed department and the security bureau; the other commissioners controlled various workshops, using them to suppress the revolutionary mass movement. They carried out a "surrounding and annihilating" campaign against the Red Rebel Corps, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, adopting the "suppress, pull, hit, smash" policy, reducing the Red Rebel Corps from over eighty to more than fifty. However, the red rebels were indomitable heroes, "in the twilight, the pines stand tall, the clouds fly wildly, and they remain composed." They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At this critical moment, Yu Zhiyuan, an old comrade with over thirty years of party membership, on the one hand, refused to participate in the so-called "party committee" election meeting, and on the other hand, fought side by side with the red rebels. He never forgot to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the comrades of the Red Rebel Corps, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in difficult times, raise our courage." He used the example of the Long March of the Red Army to encourage them: "Don't worry, although our ranks have shrunk, they have become purer and our combat effectiveness has been enhanced." Under Yu Zhiyuan's enlightenment, the Red Rebel Corps held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out rectification, enhanced their courage to fight against the enemy, strengthened their unity, and finally expanded from thirty-two people to nearly two hundred. The ranks grew stronger and stronger, shattering the enemy's carefully planned conspiracy.

In these difficult days of white terror, the bourgeois forces in power and the conservative forces politically persecuted Yu Zhiyuan, "criticizing" and "struggling" against him. However, Yu Zhiyuan remained unyielding and withstood the test of strikes and persecution. When Yu Zhiyuan's activities were restricted, he turned from open activities to underground. Outside the factory, he used various methods to contact the red rebels inside the factory and, together with the red rebels, shattered one white terror after another.

Three

How to deal with the issue of those in power, the editorial of the third issue of "Red Flag" points out: "It is necessary to distinguish whether it is a proletarian cadre in power or a bourgeois cadre in power, whether it is to support and implement the proletarian revolutionary line or to support and implement the bourgeois reactionary line. It is wrong to think that as long as they are in power, they should not be trusted at all. It is against the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought class viewpoint to oppose everything, exclude everything, and overthrow everything without distinguishing right from wrong." In the past difficult years of struggle, Yu Zhiyuan, for the Party and the people's revolutionary cause, struggled hard; in this factory, he had fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; especially in this movement, at the decisive moment when the red rebels fought against the bourgeoisie and their representatives, he stood firmly on the side of the red rebels and united with the revolutionary masses to fight together. Therefore, he was seen as a thorn in the eye by these bourgeois gentlemen and, in the early stages of the movement, the target was aimed at Yu Zhiyuan, collecting his "materials" everywhere, struggling against Yu Zhiyuan, labeling him as a "revisionist counter-revolutionary," making him a scapegoat to shift the target and pass through.

At that time, the red rebels followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution," using the class viewpoint to look at those in power, strictly differentiating between enemies and friends. They firmly fought against and exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, making them never able to rise again; they firmly helped and supported the proletarian cadres in power, cooperating with them. However, Yu Zhiyuan was indeed a cadre in power who stood on the proletarian revolutionary line. Although he had some shortcomings and mistakes, he could insist on the truth, correct his mistakes, correctly deal with his own problems, and correctly deal with the criticisms raised by the masses, and sincerely checked himself with the masses. Therefore, the red rebels supported, helped, and cooperated with Yu Zhiyuan and opposed the bourgeois gentlemen and conservative forces' framing of Yu Zhiyuan, making their "struggle meeting" end in failure. Because the red rebels dared to insist on the truth, held up clear banners, dared to struggle, they were attacked and slandered by the bourgeois gentlemen and their elite guards—the Red Guards. They said that Yu Zhiyuan was the "ancestor" of the Red Rebel Corps and so on. However, the red rebels and Yu Zhiyuan remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." They were not afraid of any slander and defamation, and in the struggle, they united more closely, laying a good foundation for their unity in the power seizure struggle.

Four

The Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage—power seizure struggle. The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai set an example for the whole country. The true red rebels think of power seizure, speak of power seizure, and do power seizure! The red rebels of the Bicycle Factory, after hearing the telegram of congratulations from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the various revolutionary rebel factions in Shanghai, were eager to seize power! On January 12, the comrades of the Red Rebel Corps went to the headquarters to hold a meeting and decided to seize power that night. Revolutionary cadres thought what the red rebels thought and were eager for what the red rebels were eager for. Yu Zhiyuan, who was outside the factory at that time, also discussed the issue of seizing power immediately with the members of the Red Rebel Corps. Thus, the red rebels, in the early hours of January 13, seized the party, government, and financial powers from the hands of the bourgeois gentlemen! The editorial of the third issue of "Red Flag" points out: "It is necessary to attach sufficient importance to the role of revolutionary cadres in the power seizure struggle," "when revolutionary cadres stand up and, together with the masses, seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, revolutionary mass organizations should support them." The unity of the red rebels of the Bicycle Factory and the revolutionary cadre Yu Zhiyuan in the struggle fully embodies the spirit of the "Red Flag" editorial.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power and the consolidation of power." After seizing power, the task facing each red rebel is whether to carry the revolution through or to stop halfway. The comrades of the Red Rebel Corps, in a short period after seizing power, focused on production and some administrative work, and slightly relaxed the movement. Yu Zhiyuan timely raised the issue of carrying the revolution through to the end. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." They jointly studied the corresponding measures: on the one hand, they must thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary organization Red Army and the conservative organization Red Guards, educate and win over the deceived masses to return to the revolutionary line; on the other hand, they must promote production through revolution, advance with victory, and strive for greater victories! Due to the efforts of all the red rebels, the Red Army was completely destroyed! The Red Guards also collapsed! The Honor Restoration Army and the Preparedness Army also disintegrated! Then, some of the deceived masses in these conservative and reactionary organizations rose up and launched a fierce counterattack, severely striking a handful of stubborn elements and reactionaries who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, winning over and uniting the intermediate and deceived masses, and the revolutionary leftist forces became stronger and stronger, and the situation was very good! The red rebels and revolutionary workers, with the surging momentum aroused by the Cultural Revolution, managed production themselves, took the initiative, and completed 80% of the January production task in just sixteen days, making the monthly plan completed one and a half days ahead of schedule, with the quality reaching the highest level since the factory was established, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line! In this process, the fifty-year-old Yu Zhiyuan seemed to have become younger. Originally resting at home, he is now working every day with illness, fighting with the young rebels of the Red Rebel Corps with great enthusiasm! Due to the efforts of all the red rebels and the unity of the red rebels with revolutionary cadres, they achieved double victories in revolution and production!

Recently, the red rebels and revolutionary cadres have studied together "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas within the Party" and "Opposing Liberalism," etc., deeply reflecting on their souls, fighting against the non-proletarian thoughts that have grown, and are determined to rebel to the end, firmly grasp and consolidate the power of the red rebels, and will not be a flash in the pan, advancing with victory, thoroughly smashing the capitalist and revisionist old things in the factory, and striving to create a new socialist enterprise!

    红色造反者同革命领导干部结合好得很
    ——哈尔滨自行车厂红色造反者同革命领导干部相结合取得夺权和掌权的重大胜利
    毛主席教导我们说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”哈尔滨自行车厂的红色造反者，牢记毛主席的教导，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，特别是在这场伟大的夺权斗争中，遵照党的方针政策，严格区分敌友我，同坚持无产阶级革命路线的领导干部相结合，取得了夺权和掌权的重大胜利。
    一
    一九六六年八月，哈尔滨自行车厂受压制的红色造反者起来造反了！他们于八月二十四日成立了自己的组织——哈尔滨自行车厂红色造反团，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火！党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派慌了手脚，当即针对造反团，一手策划拚凑了“东风”、“红旗”等保字号组织。在这尖锐复杂的阶级斗争面前，一九五八年从部队转业到地方、一九六五年到哈尔滨自行车厂任副厂长的于志远同志，遵照毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，学习了《湖南农民运动考察报告》，从家庭到社会，从学校到工厂，作了一系列的调查研究，对各群众团体的组织成员和他们所处的政治、经济地位，以及他们的言行，进行了详细的分析。他发现厂内参加红色造反团的都是被过去的那些“领导”称之为“痞子”的一些工人，他们在走资本主义道路的当权派的压抑之下，除了劳动的权利之外，别无其它；而参加保字号组织的，除了受蒙蔽的群众之外，就是那些走资本主义道路当权派的得意之人。再看看八八团与造反团的大方向：造反团一开始就紧紧抓住斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；而八八团则东打一耙，西打一耙，不敢把斗争矛头对准党内走资本主义道路的当权派。这一切，使于志远同志看清了红色造反团是文化大革命的闯将，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢造反，是具有生命力的革命组织。因而于志远同志从思想上，阶级感情上，行动上，自觉地主动地同红色造反者站在一起，并肩战斗！
    二
    红色造反团是在白色恐怖下杀出来的！在九月三日，即红色造反团仅成立十天的时候，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就认为自己的“阎王殿”坐不稳了，他们跳了出来，急急忙忙召开中上层干部会议，以“引火烧身”为名，行消灭革命左派力量之实，阴谋把全厂六个组织合并，从而扼杀新生的红色造反团。当时人数占绝对优势的保皇团体与其一呼一应，拼命地扯着破嗓子叫喊“合并”！但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色造反者一眼看穿了这个阴谋，揭开了他们的鬼把戏，坚决反对！在这关键时刻，于志远同志站了出来，站在毛主席革命路线一边，坚决支持红色造反者，当场指出：“合并不合并是群众的事情，中央有指示，十六条也明文规定‘要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神’。红色造反团是少数，十六条中说要保护少数，因为真理有时掌握在少数人手里。”他鲜明的立场，当即遭到资产阶级老爷们疯狂的反对，被剥夺了发言权，但他仍然不屈地说：“我有保留意见的权利！”
    “压迫愈深，反抗愈大”，敌人必定是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。红色造反者天不怕，地不怕，炮轰厂党委，把走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子揪了出来。敌人不甘心自己的灭亡，坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，又继续耍阴谋，玩诡计，拼凑起反革命新“阎王殿”——临时党委。临时党委派两个委员控制两个御林军——赤卫队和红旗军；另外两个委员控制了两个专政工具——武装部、保卫科；其他委员控制各个车间，用以压制革命群众运动。他们对红色造反者进行“围剿”，实行资产阶级专政，采取“压、拉、打、瓦”四字方针，使红色造反团从八十余人减少到五十多人。但是，红色造反者是挤不倒、压不垮的英雄汉，“暮色苍茫看劲松，乱云飞渡仍从容”，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在这关键的时刻，于志远这个有三十多年党龄的老同志，一面拒绝参加拼凑所谓选“党委”的党员大会，一面同红色造反者并肩战斗。他念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和红色造反团同志一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”并用红军长征的实例鼓舞他们说：“不要紧，看数量我们队伍是缩小了，但更纯洁了，战斗力更强了。”在于志远同志的启发下，红色造反团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进行了整风，提高了对敌斗争的勇气，加强了团结，队伍最后由三十二人发展到近二百人。队伍越来越壮大了，粉碎了敌人精心策划的阴谋。
    在这白色恐怖的艰苦的日子里，资产阶级当权派和保皇势力对于志远同志进行政治迫害，“批判”、“斗争”，但是，于志远同志坚强不屈，经受住了打击、迫害的考验。当于志远同志的活动受到限制的时候，他便由公开活动转入地下。在厂外，通过各种方法同厂内的红色造反者取得联系，和红色造反者一起粉碎了一次又一次的白色恐怖。
    三
    如何对待当权派的问题，《红旗》杂志第三期社论指出：“一定要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派，是拥护和执行无产阶级革命路线，还是拥护和执行资产阶级反动路线。认为只要是当权派，就一概不相信，这是不对的。不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的。”于志远同志在过去的艰苦斗争的岁月里，为了党和人民的革命事业，艰苦奋斗；在这个工厂里同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作过斗争；特别是在这次运动中，在红色造反者同资产阶级及其代表人物决战时刻，他坚定地站在红色造反者一边，和革命群众相结合，共同战斗。因而被这些资产阶级老爷们视为眼中钉，运动初期就把矛头对准了于志远同志，到处搜集他的“材料”，斗争于志远同志，把他打成“反革命修正主义分子”，让他当替罪羊，以转移目标、保自己过关。
    当时红色造反者遵照毛主席“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，用阶级观点看待当权派，严格区分敌友我界限。他们对党内走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决斗倒、斗臭，让他永世不得翻身；对无产阶级当权派，坚决帮助，坚决支持，与他合作。而于志远同志确是站在无产阶级革命路线上的领导干部。他虽然有些缺点、错误，但他能坚持真理修正错误，正确对待自己的问题，正确对待群众提出的批评意见，并诚恳地向群众作检查。因而，红色造反者对于志远同志是支持、帮助、合作的态度，并反对资产阶级老爷们和保皇势力对于志远同志的陷害，使他们的“斗争会”以失败而告终。由于红色造反者敢于坚持真理，旗帜鲜明，敢于斗争，遭到了资产阶级老爷们和他们的御林军——赤卫队一小撮人的攻击和诽谤，说什么于志远同志是红色造反团的“祖师爷”等等。但是，红色造反者和于志远同志牢记毛主席的教导：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”他们不怕任何诬蔑和诽谤，在斗争中结合得更紧密了，为在夺权斗争中的结合打下了良好的基础。
    四
    文化大革命进入了一个新的阶段——夺权斗争。上海的革命造反派为全国作出了榜样。真正的红色造反者想的是夺权，说的是夺权，干的是夺权！自行车厂的红色造反者听到中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海各革命造反派的贺电以后，一个个摩拳擦掌，要夺权！一月十二日，红色造反团的同志到总部开会，决定连夜夺权。革命的领导干部想红色造反者所想，急红色造反者所急，于志远同志当时在厂外也同红色造反团成员商量立即夺权的问题。于是红色造反者在十二日深夜，把自行车厂的党、政、财大权从资产阶级老爷们手里夺了回来！《红旗》杂志第三期社论指出：“必须足够重视革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用”，“当革命的领导干部起来，同群众一道，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，革命的群众团体应当支持他们。”自行车厂的红色造反者同革命的领导干部于志远同志在斗争中的结合，完全体现了《红旗》社论的精神。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”夺权后，摆在每一个红色造反者面前的任务，是革命到底呢，还是半途而废？红色造反团的同志们在夺权后的一个短时期内，抓了生产和一些事务性的工作，对运动稍为松懈了些。于志远同志及时地提出了必须将革命进行到底的问题。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”他们共同研究了相应的措施：一方面要彻底摧垮反革命组织红旗军、保皇团体赤卫队，教育和争取受蒙蔽的群众回到革命的路线上来；另一方面要通过狠抓革命，狠促生产，乘胜前进，争取更大的胜利！由于全体红色造反者的努力，红旗军彻底完蛋了！赤卫队也瓦解了！荣复军、战备军也崩溃了！接着，这些保字号和反动组织中的一些受蒙蔽的群众起来狠杀了回马枪，狠狠打击了一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子和反动分子，争取和团结了中间和受蒙蔽的群众，革命左派力量日益壮大，形势一片大好！红色造反者和革命工人用文化大革命中激发起来的冲天干劲，自己管理生产，当家作主，仅十六天就完成了一月份百分之八十的生产任务，使月计划提前一天半完成了，质量达到建厂以来的最高水平，彻底粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！在这个过程中，五十多岁的于志远同志似乎年青了，原来在家休养，现在带病天天上班，同红色造反者小将们一道奋战，干劲十足！由于全体红色造反者的努力，由于红色造反者同革命的领导干部相结合，取得了革命生产双胜利！
    最近，红色造反者同革命的领导干部一起学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》等文章，狠触自己的灵魂，狠斗滋长出来的非无产阶级的思想，决心造反到底，牢牢掌握和巩固红色造反者的大权，决不做昙花一现的人物，乘胜前进，彻底砸碎资本主义、修正主义在厂子里的那一套旧东西，为创造一个崭新的社会主义的新企业而奋斗！
