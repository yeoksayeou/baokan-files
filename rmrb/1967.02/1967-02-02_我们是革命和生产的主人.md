We are the masters of revolution and production.

The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat have united, removed the officials who took the capitalist road from power, and seized their authority. This has shattered the chains that constrained the development of productive forces, and will inevitably bring about a thriving scene of dual harvests in both revolution and production.

A handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road and stubborn elements who insisted on the reactionary bourgeois line are unwilling to accept their defeat. They employ various tricks, attempting to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to mock the revolutionary rebels. However, the revolutionary rebels, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are all towering heroes. They firmly believe that without these "masters," things will be done even better.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebel workers of Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, Beijing Sanjia Tree Vehicle Section, and Beijing Postage Stamp Factory are full of spirit and high morale. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, set ambitious goals, and, on the premise of doing a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have excellently completed their production tasks.

This is the reality. This is the new situation that has emerged after the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat have overthrown a handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road and seized power themselves.

These living facts show that as long as the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will not only be good at destroying an old world but also at creating a bright new world.

"The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will?"

Let that handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road tremble before us, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat! We revolutionary rebels have the ability and the spirit, and we will definitely make the revolution and production even better, better, and better!

    我们是革命和生产的主人
    无产阶级革命造反派联合起来，一旦罢了走资本主义道路当权派的官，夺了他们的权，就敲碎了束缚生产力发展的锁链，必然出现一片欣欣向荣的革命生产双丰收的新气象。
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子不甘心他们的失败。他们耍弄种种花招，妄图破坏生产，破坏文化大革命，看革命造反派的“笑话”。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派个个都是顶天立地的英雄汉，他们坚信，没有这班“老爷”们，事情反而会办得更好些。
    北京第二机床厂、三棵树车辆段和北京邮票厂的革命造反派职工夺权以后，意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，树雄心，立壮志，在搞好文化大革命的前提下，出色地完成了生产任务。
    这就是事实，这就是无产阶级革命造反派在大造一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的反、自己掌权之后，出现的新气象。
    这些活生生的事实说明，我们无产阶级革命造反派真正掌握了毛泽东思想，就不但善于破坏一个旧世界，而且还善于创建一个红彤彤的新世界。
    “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”
    让那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在我们无产阶级革命造反派面前发抖吧！我们革命造反派有能力、有志气，一定会把革命和生产搞得更好，更好，更好！
