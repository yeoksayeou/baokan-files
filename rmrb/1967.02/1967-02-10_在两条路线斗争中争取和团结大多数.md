Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: We must pay attention to uniting with all those who can be united with. The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself.

At this critical moment of the revolutionary masses' great unity and seizure of power, the revolutionary rebels must not only unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought but also unite with the broad revolutionary masses to form a mighty proletarian revolutionary army. Only in this way can we seize the party power, state power, financial power, and cultural power from the hands of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary rebels of Harbin Normal University, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, have adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line. In the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, they have adopted the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the illness to save the person" and the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to patiently persuade and educate those who have been deceived, thus uniting the majority of the masses around them.

The experience of the revolutionary rebels of Harbin Normal University is excellent and can be referred to by other places.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, "completely isolating the most reactionary rightists, winning over the middle elements, and uniting with the majority, through the movement, ultimately uniting more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses." This is the strategic thinking of our great leader Chairman Mao, a decisive factor in the success or failure of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Based on Chairman Mao's great thought, in the struggle to eliminate the bourgeois reactionary line, we have adhered to the principle of "clearing up ideological issues while uniting comrades," firmly grasping the overall direction of the movement, and mobilizing the entire team to work on uniting and winning over the majority. With the deepening of the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line and the comprehensive failure of the bourgeois reactionary line, the Red Rebel Corps, which started with over 300 people, has grown to over 2,500 people. The "88 Corps," which started with over 2,000 people, has been reduced to over 100 people. Not only has the balance of power between the two sides undergone a fundamental change, but more importantly, the great thought of Mao Zedong and the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao have occupied a solid position among the broad masses of our school. On January 12, we carried out the struggle for power, and the Red Rebel Corps became the sole power organ of our school, creating the most fundamental conditions for the thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution in our school.

How did we strive to unite and win over the majority?

Uniting the majority is a necessity for revolutionary struggle

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the focus of the struggle between the Red Rebel Corps and the 88 Corps has always been on whether to "overthrow" or "protect" the capitalist-roaders within the party and the counter-revolutionary revisionists. Later, the 88 Corps, under the instigation of the capitalist-roaders within the party and the provincial work team, launched attacks on us, compiled black materials against us, and labeled us as "counter-revolutionaries" and "anti-party elements."

In such a situation, should we still strive to unite with the majority of the 88 Corps to carry out the revolution together through struggle? This was an important issue facing us.

In the course of the struggle, many of our comrades realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao is the largest, most extensive, most arduous, and most glorious mass movement in the world. It is impossible for us few comrades to accomplish this great historical mission alone. If the soldiers of the 88 Corps continue to be manipulated and deceived by the capitalist-roaders within the party, standing on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, how can the capitalist-roaders be thoroughly overthrown, smashed, and exposed? How can the roots of revisionism be thoroughly uprooted? How can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried out to the end? It is also our duty as red rebels to unite and educate those who have made mistakes and are willing to correct them to return to Chairman Mao's line to revolutionize together. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On the Study of the Current Situation," "On the Strategy for Opposing Japanese Imperialism," and "On the Strategic Problems of the Current Anti-Japanese United Front." Chairman Mao said: "Organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." He also warned us not to drive "tens of millions" and "vast" to the enemy's side, isolating ourselves. Some comrades also quoted a passage from Lu Xun: "Because they come from the old ruins, they see the situation more clearly, and a counterattack with one spear can easily strike the enemy's vital point." to explain the role of the soldiers of the 88 Corps after they come over.

Through study and discussion, the situation quickly developed into the whole team working together, with everyone doing the work of uniting and winning over the majority, and in practice, our understanding deepened, our work became more detailed, and our achievements became greater.

Grasping the direction of the struggle is the key to uniting the majority

Chairman Mao teaches us: An important link in winning over the middle elements is "to resolutely struggle against the diehards and gradually achieve victory." Some people in the 88 Corps have a thousand and one connections with the capitalist-roaders within the party. They are deeply poisoned by the capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, a resolute struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line and the capitalist-roaders within the party, a thorough exposure, and an uncompromising criticism, not only ensure the correctness of the direction of the movement but also awaken those who have been deceived, winning over and uniting the majority.

The facts of the struggle are like this. After we pulled down the counter-revolutionary revisionists that the 88 Corps had been protecting, more than 200 people left the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps. After we overthrew the biggest capitalist-roader within the party in Heilongjiang Province, who was their backer, another 200-300 people joined the Rebel Corps (including the peripheral masses of the 88 Corps). After we thoroughly dismissed the head of the Party Committee's Cultural Revolution Office, who stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line, a large number of people left the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps.

The former commander of the 4th Company of the 88 Corps said: "Protect, protect, and in the end, they protected a bunch of scoundrels." The majority of the 88 Corps were deceived and wanted to revolutionize. When they realized that "they protected a bunch of scoundrels" and saw that the direction of the Rebel Corps was always correct, they broke away from the reactionary line and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Joining the Rebel Corps was a matter of course.

The process of criticism is the process of educating and uniting the majority

From the day the Red Rebel Corps was established, it firmly grasped the line of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. With the comprehensive failure of the bourgeois reactionary line, not only were those who had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" thoroughly liberated, but the deceived masses in the 88 Corps were also educated and won over. Our specific methods were:

Self-rehabilitation. In mid-August last year, we began to work on rehabilitation. At that time, there were debates within the Rebel Corps. The majority advocated relying on our own struggle to solve the rehabilitation issue, believing it to be the best way to mobilize the masses to educate and liberate themselves. They also believed that the rehabilitation issue was not just about restoring the reputation of a few people who had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" but more importantly, about educating those who had been deceived in the struggle between the two lines to stand on the revolutionary side. Only a small number of people advocated rehabilitation by the provincial committee. They feared that if we handled the rehabilitation ourselves, it might add new "crimes" to those who were rehabilitated. To solve this problem, we studied the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's relevant discussions on the mass line, unifying our thoughts. The mass rehabilitation movement made those who had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" stand up straight and also greatly educated the deceived masses in the 88 Corps. Many people were extremely indignant after understanding the various crimes of the capitalist-roaders within the party in suppressing revolutionary masses, distorting right and wrong, and fabricating facts. Some students immediately tore off the armbands of the 88 Corps and requested to join the Rebel Corps.

Rehabilitation and denunciation combined. To conduct class education for the entire corps, and more importantly, for the deceived students in the 88 Corps, we combined rehabilitation with denunciation meetings. Bo Dongxue, a son of a poor peasant from the Political Science Department, Qi Yajie, a son of a cadre, and Kou Fangyu, a son of a martyr, denounced at the meeting the persecution they suffered from the capitalist-roaders within the party and the attacks they received from some members of the 88 Corps who were unaware of the truth, educating everyone deeply. The more than ten people from the 88 Corps who went to eavesdrop also received education. The deputy secretary of the Political Science Department's Party Branch also said sadly: "They are all my students. Under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, I compiled their materials and planned to label them as 'counter-revolutionaries,' which was a serious mistake." At the rehabilitation meeting of the Biology Department, more than 20 students from the 88 Corps, after listening to others' denunciations, immediately declared their withdrawal from the 88 Corps and firmly requested to join the Rebel Corps.

"Counterattack." Organizing those who withdrew from the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps to "counterattack" is a good method to educate and win over those who were deceived in the 88 Corps to stand on the revolutionary side, because these comrades had all worked in the 88 Corps for a period and were insiders of the 88 Corps. Using their own experiences of being deceived to personally criticize the bourgeois reactionary line that the 88 Corps had implemented was the most convincing. In the process of "counterattack," more and more people withdrew from the 88 Corps and requested to join the Rebel Corps.

Acting according to policy is the fundamental guarantee for uniting the majority

The struggle between the Rebel Corps and the 88 Corps is a reflection of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, in mass organizations. This struggle is a major issue concerning whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be carried out to the end. Therefore, in the struggle, we must adhere to principles and cannot compromise or reconcile. However, our contradictions with the broad masses of the 88 Corps belong to contradictions within the people, so we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, adhere to the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the illness to save the person," and adopt the method of "unity-criticism-unity," focusing on solving problems in thought. Only in this way can we truly achieve unity, not just formal so-called "unity." Our main methods were:

Individual talks. This work initially encountered many obstacles because some of our comrades did not know how to do persuasion and education work, and their attitudes were rigid; sometimes they were cold-shouldered by the students of the 88 Corps, resulting in many unsuccessful attempts. Later, we improved our methods, using past good relationships, hometowns, and other favorable conditions, following them to factories, finding various opportunities to approach the students of the 88 Corps, and patiently persuading and educating them with full enthusiasm, achieving better results.

Holding welcome meetings. For every student who withdrew from the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps, we held welcome meetings or discussions, welcoming new comrades and sharing our feelings. Reviewing the history of the Cultural Revolution, we focused our hatred on the bourgeois reactionary line. Everyone came to a common understanding that we were all victims of the reactionary line, and the past estrangements were all caused by the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line. At a welcome meeting, someone proposed the phrase "old rebels, new rebels," which was immediately criticized by the comrades of the Rebel Corps. We also jointly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the revolution not distinguishing between early and late, educating everyone, making the new comrades who joined the Rebel Corps feel at ease.

"Living materials" instead of "dead materials." In the process of demanding black materials, some people initially attached great importance to black materials, even causing conflicts with the 88 Corps. To solve this problem, the entire corps held two major debates and unified our understanding. Everyone believed that black materials were all compiled under the instructions of the capitalist-roaders within the party, and the responsibility did not lie with the masses. We should "pull them up but not pull them down." At the same time, focusing only on "dead materials" without touching the soul cannot truly solve problems in thought, and they might compile black materials again based on memory. Therefore, we proposed the slogan "No 'dead materials,' but 'living materials' (referring to grasping the living thoughts of the opponent)." By placing the issue of materials on truly solving problems in thought, we not only eliminated conflicts when demanding black materials but also many people who compiled black materials voluntarily handed them over.

Treating new and old comrades equally. Initially, some people in the Rebel Corps did not allow those who withdrew from the 88 Corps and newly joined the Rebel Corps to have a familiarization process, complaining that they could not keep up with the pace, while the diehards of the 88 Corps also spread rumors, saying that joining the Rebel Corps meant being discriminated against. In response to this situation, we organized the study of the section "Put down your burden, start your engine" from Chairman Mao's "On the Study of the Current Situation," raising our awareness, and strengthening the atmosphere of mutual learning between new and old comrades. Many students who withdrew from the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps were elected as leaders of various levels of organizations. This not only made the internal unity stronger but also played a significant role in winning over the deceived comrades.

Firmly supporting the deceived comrades to rebel

Chairman Mao said: "Wherever there are masses, there are generally three parts of people: the relatively active, the intermediate, and the relatively backward." With the failure of the bourgeois reactionary line, the 88 Corps also began to split, with some core members insisting on their mistakes, the majority beginning to waver, and many people rebelling against the 88 Corps. Based on these three different situations, we adopted the method of differentiated treatment, helping them to get rid of the influence of the erroneous line.

Some core members of the 88 Corps insisted on their mistakes seriously. We seriously criticized their mistakes but did not give up on patiently persuading and educating them. We wrote many articles and leaflets criticizing the mistakes of the 88 Corps, exposing the process of their establishment under the instructions of the capitalist-roaders within the party, presenting their erroneous facts, and explaining that the 88 Corps implemented an erroneous line. Faced with the facts, some of them had different degrees of understanding of their mistakes, prompting them to withdraw from the 88 Corps.

We firmly supported the rebels within the 88 Corps. When the "Great Democracy Commune" of the 88 Corps rebelled, they felt great difficulties and obstacles. At this time, we studied Chairman Mao's works with them and firmly supported their revolutionary actions.

The comrades of the "Great Democracy Commune" overcame various difficulties and used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to persuade and educate the wavering members of the 88 Corps, leading to the open rectification of the 88 Corps. The core members of the 88 Corps saw that the situation was unfavorable for them in the open rectification, and after only nine hours, they closed the door. As a result, not only did all the students of the "Great Democracy Commune" withdraw from the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps, but it also influenced some wavering members to successively withdraw from the 88 Corps, making the 88 Corps fall into a state of decline.

The greatest pressure faced by those who withdrew from the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps came from the ridicule and attacks of the diehards of the 88 Corps, who called them "traitors," "Trotskyites," "Fu Zhigao," and "waverers," and even spat at them when they met.

We seized this living thought, in addition to caring for them more, we also studied Chairman Mao's quotations with them: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." This strengthened their determination to break away from the bourgeois reactionary line and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the former deputy commander of the 88 Corps' propaganda team, Jiang Sheng, and others said: "We surrender to Mao Zedong Thought, we surrender to the truth, feeling the highest honor and greatest pride." "We were influenced by the erroneous line in the past, but now we stand on the side of Chairman Mao's correct line, which is the victory of the struggle."

Open rectification is a good method

From the day the Red Rebel Corps was established, it firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the overall direction was always correct. However, because it was a new thing, due to our lack of experience, some shortcomings and mistakes also appeared. To strengthen ideological and organizational construction, overcome our shortcomings and mistakes, rectify the ranks, and unite against the enemy, we decided to carry out rectification.

How to carry it out? Should it be open rectification or closed rectification?

Initially, there were two different opinions within the corps: a few people thought that open rectification would give the 88 Corps an opportunity to take advantage. The majority believed that the actions of the Red Rebel Corps were all above board, and we were not afraid of others knowing our shortcomings. Our rectification was not only to correct our shortcomings but also to educate the deceived masses. In the process of discussion, we studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others criticizing and pointing out our shortcomings. No matter who it is, as long as you point out our shortcomings, we will correct them. If your method is good for the people, we will follow your advice." Through study, we unified our thoughts and decided to carry out open rectification, proposing the slogan "Revolution cannot be toppled, non-revolutionaries deserve to be toppled!" and warmly welcoming revolutionary comrades from the entire school and city to help us with rectification.

In the process of rectification, in addition to carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the corps, the 88 Corps and outsiders also proposed many opinions for us, such as not paying attention to the strategy of struggle, simple and crude methods, etc. We humbly accepted them and conducted a serious self-examination. Thus, the prestige of the Rebel Corps was further enhanced. We were not only not toppled but also grew stronger in the rectification. Those who proposed opinions from the 88 Corps all withdrew from the 88 Corps and joined the Rebel Corps.

Carrying out ideological struggles within the corps

With the failure of the bourgeois reactionary line, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line was grasped by more and more revolutionary masses. The original 88 Corps and other deceived comrades successively joined the Red Rebel Corps, making the number of the Rebel Corps increase day by day. This is a good thing, but it also brought new problems, making the ideological struggles within the corps gradually stand out. Among the new comrades who joined the Rebel Corps, some studied Chairman Mao's works well, deeply touched their souls, and firmly grasped their ideological transformation, quickly becoming true rebels. However, there were also some who studied Chairman Mao's works poorly, especially did not deeply touch their souls. After joining the Rebel Corps, they brought some erroneous thoughts and concepts into the Rebel Corps. These people catered to the politically backward people within the corps, forming the "88 faction" within the Rebel Corps. Their thoughts and actions were very inconsistent with the broad red rebels.

Chairman Mao said: "We advocate active ideological struggles because they are weapons for achieving unity within the party and revolutionary organizations to facilitate combat." To make the entire corps truly unite in thought and action on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, we actively carried out ideological struggles within the corps, centering on the struggle between the two lines.

Initially, some comrades advocated expelling all the "88 brains." After debate, everyone realized that the existence of ideological struggles within the corps is a necessary reflection of the struggle between the two lines in society and is a normal phenomenon. These problems cannot be solved by simple methods but must be solved according to Chairman Mao's instructions, on the one hand, we must seriously struggle against erroneous thoughts, on the other hand, we must fully give those who make mistakes the opportunity to awaken themselves.

In the ideological struggles within the corps, we fully utilized the form of great democracy, carrying out great debates, big-character posters, and big link-ups. We believed that the most effective methods were two kinds: one was the "touch the soul meeting," and the other was to grasp typical problems and debate them throughout the corps.

Touch the soul meeting. The number of participants can be many or few, and the scale can be large or small, but the effect of small-scale meetings is the best. Using this form, some comrades initially often got stuck on trivial matters. After studying Chairman Mao's instruction "Criticism should pay attention to politics," the "touch the soul meeting" gradually focused on the struggle between the two lines. New and old comrades all had to touch their souls, especially the cadres had to take the lead in touching their souls. The squad leader of the Art Department took the lead in touching his soul, checking himself during the period of great ups and downs, for not clearly recognizing the bourgeois reactionary line and not resisting it strongly, educating everyone greatly. Some new comrades listened and also seriously touched their souls.

Corps-wide debate. Grasping typical problems and debating them throughout the corps also had good effects. In the debate, we must firmly act according to the "Sixteen Points," adopt the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and persuading with reason, not using power to suppress, and even if the erroneous opinions are not against Chairman Mao, not against the Party, and not attacking the proletarian headquarters, we allow them to defend and reserve their opinions. For example, in our corps, someone spread the idea that the 88 Corps' direction was correct and the Rebel Corps' direction was wrong. Everyone believed that it represented a kind of thought within the corps, so we grasped this problem and carried out a great debate throughout the corps, which had a good effect in eliminating the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line within the corps and enhancing unity on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In practice, we deeply felt that we must actively carry out ideological struggles within the corps, and in the struggle, we must firmly grasp the line of struggle between the two lines. Only in this way can the entire corps truly achieve unity, and if not handled well, it will change the color of the Rebel Corps and will not be able to rebel to the end.

In 1967, it was a year of full-scale class struggle throughout the country. The task facing us red rebels is extremely arduous. We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, turn the Red Rebel Corps into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and forge it into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready revolutionary force. We must firmly grasp the overall direction of the movement, use Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics, improve our combat skills, unite and win over the majority, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    在两条路线斗争中争取和团结大多数
    哈尔滨师范学院毛泽东思想红卫兵红色造反团
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：要注意争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。
    在当前无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的决战时刻，革命造反派不仅要在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来，而且要团结广大革命群众，组成一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军，这样，才能保证从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里，把党权、政权、财权、文权统统夺过来，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    哈尔滨师范学院革命造反派，遵照毛主席的教导，坚持了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在和走资本主义道路当权派以及坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子进行坚决斗争的过程中，对那些受蒙蔽的群众，本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法，耐心地进行说服教育，从而把大多数群众团结在自己的周围。
    哈尔滨师范学院革命造反派的经验很好，可供各地参考。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，“彻底孤立最反动的右派，争取中间派，团结大多数，经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众。”这是伟大领袖毛主席的战略思想，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命成败的决定性因素。我们本着毛主席这一伟大思想，在肃清资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，坚持了“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的原则，牢牢掌握住运动的大方向，全团动手，人人做争取和团结大多数的工作。随着对资产阶级反动路线的深入批判和资产阶级反动路线的全面破产，红色造反团由开始的三百余人，发展到二千五百多人。保字派的八八团由二千多人，减少到一百多人。不仅双方力量的对比发生了根本的变化，更重要的是使伟大的毛泽东思想和以毛主席为代表的革命路线，在我院广大群众中占领了巩固的阵地。我们在一月十二日进行了夺权斗争，红色造反团成了我院唯一的权力机关，为文化大革命在我院的彻底胜利创造了最根本的条件。
    我们是怎样争取和团结大多数的呢？
    团结大多数是革命斗争的需要
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，红色造反团和八八团之间斗争的焦点，一直集中在对党内走资本主义道路的当权派、反革命修正主义分子，是“革”还是“保”的问题上。后来，八八团还在党内走资本主义道路的当权派和省委工作队的指使下，对我们进行围攻，整理我们的黑材料，把我们打成“反革命”、“反党分子”。
    在这种情况下，还要不要通过斗争来团结八八团的多数群众一道干革命呢？这是摆在我们面前的一个重要课题。
    在斗争的实践中，我们的许多战士认识到，毛主席亲自发动的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命是世界上规模最大、最广泛、任务最艰巨、最光荣的群众运动，光靠我们少数同志是不能完成这个伟大历史使命的。如果让八八团的战士继续被党内走资本主义道路的当权派操纵、蒙蔽，站在资产阶级反动路线一边，那末走资本主义道路的当权派怎么能彻底斗倒，斗垮，斗臭？修正主义的根子怎么能彻底挖掉？无产阶级文化大革命怎么能进行到底呢？团结教育那些犯了错误并愿意改正的同志回到毛主席的路线上来一道革命，也是我们红色造反者应尽的责任。我们反复学习了毛主席的《学习和时局》、《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》、《目前抗日统一战线中的策略问题》等光辉著作。毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”并告诫我们，不能把“千千万万”和“浩浩荡荡”都赶到敌人那边去，把自己孤立起来。有的战士还引用了鲁迅的一段话：“因为从旧垒中来，情况看得较为分明，反击一戈，易制强敌的死命。”来说明八八团的战士过来后的作用。
    经过学习讨论，很快就出现了全团动手，人人做争取和团结大多数工作的局面，并在实践中，认识不断提高，工作越来越细，成绩也越来越大。
    掌握斗争大方向是团结大多数的关键
    毛主席教导我们：争取中间派的一个重要环节，就是“我们对顽固派作坚决的斗争，并能一步一步地取得胜利。”八八团中的一些人，和党内走资本主义道路的当权派，有着千丝万缕的联系，他们受走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的毒害很深。因此对资产阶级反动路线和党内走资本主义道路的当权派，作坚决的斗争，彻底的揭发，无情的批判，不仅能保证运动的大方向正确，而且能使受蒙蔽的人猛醒，争取和团结大多数。
    斗争的事实就是这样。当我们把八八团死保的反革命修正主义分子拉下马后，他们就有二百多人退出八八团加入造反团。当我们把他们的后台黑龙江省党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派打倒之后，又有二三百人参加了造反团（包括八八团的外围群众）。在我们把顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的党委文革办公室主任彻底罢官之后，又有一大批人，退出八八团加入了造反团。
    原八八团四连连长说：“保啊，保啊，结果保的净是些坏蛋。”八八团中大多数人都是受蒙蔽的，是要革命的。当他们认识到了“保的净是些坏蛋”并且看见造反团的大方向始终正确时，他们就摆脱反动路线，回到毛主席革命路线上来。参加造反团，就是理所当然的了。
    批判的过程是教育团结大多数的过程
    红色造反团从它成立的一天起，就紧紧地抓住了批判资产阶级反动路线这个纲，随着资产阶级反动路线的全面破产，不仅彻底解放了被打成“反革命”的群众，同时也教育和争取了八八团中受蒙蔽的群众。我们的具体作法是：
    平反靠自己。去年八月中旬，我们就着手平反工作。当时在造反团内就有争论。大多数人主张依靠自己的斗争解决平反问题，他们认为这是发动群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的最好办法。同时认为平反问题，不只是给几个被打成“反革命”的人恢复名誉的问题，更重要的是教育那些在两条路线的斗争中，受蒙蔽的群众站到革命方面来。只有一小部分人主张平反靠省委。他们怕自己平反搞不好，又会给被平反的人增加新的“罪过”。为了解决这个问题，我们学习了十六条和毛主席有关群众路线的论述，使思想认识统一了。群众性的平反运动，使被打成“反革命”的人挺起了腰杆，也使八八团中受蒙蔽的群众受到了很大教育。很多人明白了党内走资本主义道路的当权派为了镇压革命群众，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，捏造事实的种种罪恶之后，异常气愤。有的同学当场扯下八八团的袖章，要求参加造反团。
    平反和控诉相结合。为了向全团，更主要的是向八八团中受蒙蔽的同学进行阶级教育，我们把平反和诉苦会结合起来进行。政治系贫农儿子董学章，干部子弟齐亚杰和烈士子弟寇方玉，在会上控诉自己遭到党内走资本主义道路当权派的迫害和受到不明真相的八八团一些成员围攻的经过，使大家受到很深的教育。八八团去偷听的十几个人也受到了教育。政治系党总支副书记也难过地说：“他们都是我的学生，在资产阶级反动路线影响下，我整理了他们的材料，准备打成‘反革命’，这是非常错误的。”生物系平反会上，二十多名八八团同学听了别人的控诉后，当场声明退出八八团，坚决要求参加造反团。
    “杀回马枪”。组织退出八八团加入造反团的同学“杀回马枪”，是教育和争取八八团中受蒙蔽的人站到革命方面来的好方法，因为这些同志都在八八团中干过一段，是八八团内幕的知情者，用自己受蒙蔽的经过现身说法，回头批判八八团推行的资产阶级反动路线，最有说服力。在“杀回马枪”的过程中，不断有人从八八团退出，要求加入造反团。
    按政策办事是团结大多数的根本保证
    造反团和八八团的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争在群众团体之间的反映。这一斗争是关系到能否把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大问题。因此在斗争中，必须坚持原则，决不能搞折中，搞调和。但是我们和八八团广大群众的矛盾，又属于人民内部矛盾，因此，对待他们必须按照毛主席的教导，本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法，注重在思想上真正解决问题。这样才能从根本上达到团结，而不是停留在形式上的所谓“团结”。我们采取的方法主要是：
    个别谈心。这一工作，开始遇到许多阻力。这是因为我们有的同志不会做说服教育工作，态度生硬；有时遭到八八团同学的冷遇，结果往往不欢而散。后来改进了方法，有的利用过去关系好、同乡等有利条件，有的跟到工厂去，找各种机会和八八团同学接近，怀着满腔热情，耐心说服教育，效果越来越好。
    开欢迎会。凡是退出八八团加入造反团的同学，我们都召开欢迎会或座谈会，欢迎新战友，谈心叙怀。回顾文化大革命以来的历史，把仇恨集中在资产阶级反动路线上。大家都共同的认识到，我们都是反动路线的受害者，过去的隔阂，都是资产阶级反动路线的影响造成的。在一次欢迎会上，有人提出“老造反，新造反”的词句，立即遭到造反团同志的批评，并且共同学了毛主席关于革命不分先后的教导，使大家都受到了教育，使新参加造反团的同学心情舒畅。
    要“活材料”不要“死材料”。在要黑材料的过程中，开始，有些人对黑材料看得很重，甚至与八八团发生纠纷。为了解决这个问题，全团进行了两次大辩论，统一了认识。大家认为：黑材料都是党内走资本主义道路的当权派指使搞的，责任不在群众，应该“揪上不揪下”。同时，光要“死材料”，不触及灵魂，不能从思想上真正解决问题，将来还会根据记忆把黑材料整理出来。于是我们又提出“不要‘死材料’，而要‘活材料’（指抓对方的活思想）”的口号。由于把材料问题放在真正解决思想问题上，这样，就不仅杜绝了要黑材料时的纠纷，不少整理黑材料的人还自动交出了黑材料。
    新老战士一视同仁。最初，造反团中有的人，不容许退出八八团新参加造反团的同学对造反团有一个熟悉的过程，嫌他们认识跟不上趟，同时八八团的坚定派也造谣，说参加造反团受歧视。针对这种情况，我们组织学习了毛主席的《学习和时局》一文中“放下包袱，开动机器”一节，提高了认识，在新老战士之间，增强了相互学习的空气。不少退出八八团参加造反团的同学，被选为各级组织的负责人。这样做不仅使内部更加团结了，而且对争取受蒙蔽的同学起了很大作用。
    坚决支持受蒙蔽的同学起来造反
    毛主席说：“任何有群众的地方，大致都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人。”随着资产阶级反动路线的破产，八八团也开始分化，其中有一部分骨干分子坚持错误，大部分开始动摇，还有不少人起来造八八团的反。根据这三种不同情况，我们采取了区别对待的方法，帮助他们摆脱错误路线的影响。
    八八团中的一些骨干分子，坚持错误的现象很严重。对他们的错误，我们进行了严肃的批判，但也不放弃对他们进行耐心的说服教育。我们写了许多批判八八团错误的文章和传单，揭露八八团在走资本主义道路的当权派指使下成立的经过，摆出他们的错误事实，说明八八团执行的是一条错误路线。在事实面前，他们中的一些人，对错误有了不同程度的认识，促使他们退出了八八团。
    我们坚决支持八八团中的造反派。当八八团的“大民主公社”起来造反时，他们感到困难和阻力很大。这时我们就和他们一起学习毛主席著作，坚决支持他们的这一革命行动。
    “大民主公社”的同志们，克服各种困难，用摆事实、讲道理的办法，对八八团中的动摇派进行说服教育，促成了八八团的开门整风。八八团骨干见开门整风对他们形势不妙，只开了九个小时，就关起了大门。结果不仅“大民主公社”的同学全部退出八八团，参加了造反团，同时也影响一些动摇派相继退出八八团，从此八八团一蹶不振。
    退出八八团参加造反团的人，遇到的最大压力，是来自八八团坚定派的讽刺和打击，骂他们是“叛徒”、“托洛茨基”、“甫志高”、“动摇分子”，见面还向他们吐唾沫。
    我们抓住这个活思想，除了更加关怀他们之外，还和他们一起学习毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”坚定了他们摆脱资产阶级反动路线，站到毛主席革命路线上来的决心。原八八团宣传队副队长姜声等人学了《毛主席语录》之后说：“我们向毛泽东思想投降，向真理投降，感到无上光荣，无比自豪。”“我们过去受到错误路线的影响，现在我们站到毛主席正确路线一边来，这是斗争的胜利。”
    开门整风是个好方法
    红色造反团，从它成立那一天起，就坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，大方向始终是正确的。但因为它是新生事物，由于我们缺乏经验，也出现过一些缺点和错误。为了加强思想建设和组织建设，克服我们的缺点和错误，整顿队伍，团结对敌，我们决定整风。
    怎样整法？是开门整风还是关门整风呢？
    开始在团内有两种不同的意见：少数人认为，开门整风，八八团会乘机钻空子。多数人认为，红色造反团所作所为都是光明磊落的，自己的缺点不怕别人知道。我们的整风除了改正自己的缺点外，还要教育那些受蒙蔽的群众。在讨论的过程中学习了毛主席《为人民服务》一文。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”经过学习，统一了思想，决定开门整风，提出了“革命的整不垮，不革命的整垮活该！”的口号，热烈欢迎全院、全市的革命同志们帮助我们整风。
    在整风过程中，除团内开展批评与自我批评外，八八团和团外人士给我们提出了不少意见，如不讲斗争策略，方法简单生硬等等。我们虚心接受，并作了认真检查。于是，造反团的威信更加提高了。我们不但没被整垮，而且在整风中发展壮大了。八八团提意见的人，都退出了八八团，参加了造反团。
    开展团内的思想斗争
    随着资产阶级反动路线的破产，毛主席的革命路线被越来越多的革命群众所掌握。原八八团和其他受蒙蔽的同志纷纷加入红色造反团，使造反团的人数一天天的增加。这是一件好事，但是也出现了新问题，使团内思想斗争逐渐突出起来了。在新参加造反团的同志中间，一些人毛主席著作学得好，狠触自己的灵魂，思想改造抓得紧，很快地就成了真正的造反派。但也有一部分人，毛主席著作学得较差，特别是没有很好触及自己的灵魂，加入造反团之后，把一些错误思想，错误观念也带进了造反团，这些人迎合团内政治上落后的人，形成了造反团内的“八八派”，他们在思想上、行动上和广大红色造反者很不一致。
    毛主席说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”为了使全团在思想上行动上真正的在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，我们在团内积极开展以两条路线斗争为中心的思想斗争。
    开始，个别同志主张把“八八脑袋”都开除出去，经过辩论，大家认识到，团内存在思想斗争是社会上两条路线斗争的必然反映，是正常现象。这些问题的解决，不能用简单的办法，只能按毛主席的教导，一方面必须对于错误思想进行严肃的斗争，另一方面必须充分地给犯错误的同志留有自己觉悟的机会。
    在团内思想斗争中，我们充分运用了大民主的形式，开展大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报、大串连。我们认为最有效的方法有两种：一种是“触灵魂会”，另一种是抓住典型问题全团辩论。
    触灵魂会。参加的人可多可少，规模可大可小，但小规模的效果最好。利用这种形式，最初有的同志往往纠缠在小事小节上。学习了毛主席的教导“批评要注意政治”之后，“触灵魂会”就逐渐把注意力集中在两条路线斗争上了。新战士和老战士都要触灵魂，尤其干部要带头触灵魂。艺术系分队长带头触自己的灵魂，检查自己在大反复时期，对资产阶级反动路线认识不清，抵制不力，对大家教育很大。有的新战士听了之后，自己也认真的触了灵魂。
    全团辩论。抓住典型问题全团辩论的效果也很好。在辩论中要坚决按“十六条”办事，采取摆事实，讲道理，以理服人的方法，不以势压人，即使错误的意见，只要不是反对毛主席，反对党，炮打无产阶级司令部的，就允许申辩，允许保留。例如在我团内有人散布说八八团大方向对，造反团大方向错了。大家认为它代表了团内的一种思想，于是就抓住这个问题，在全团展开了大辩论，对全团肃清资产阶级反动路线的影响，增强在毛主席革命路线上的团结，产生了很好的作用。
    在实践中，我们深深体会到，必须积极的开展团内的思想斗争，在斗争中紧紧抓住两条路线斗争的纲，非如此就不能使全团达到真正的团结，而且搞不好还会改变造反团的颜色，不能造反到底。
    一九六七年，是全国全面展开阶级斗争的一年，摆在我们红色造反者面前的任务，是十分艰巨的。我们坚决响应林彪同志的伟大号召，活学活用毛主席著作，把红色造反团办成毛泽东思想的大学校，锻炼成一支非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的革命队伍，牢牢地掌握运动的大方向，运用毛主席的战略和策略，提高斗争艺术，争取和团结大多数，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
