Edition: 4

Japanese *Chōshū Shinbun*, published in Yamaguchi Prefecture, recently published an editorial highly praising Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, *Serve the People*, and *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*. The editorial hailed "the three works" as essential reading for cultivating communist new people and as a powerful ideological weapon for transforming people's souls and promoting the revolutionization of thought.

The editorial said that Chairman Mao's *Serve the People* is permeated with the idea that all Communist Party members and state cadres must thoroughly serve the people; *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains* is permeated with the idea of self-reliance and arduous struggle, that as long as one strives, one can overcome any difficulty; *In Memory of Norman Bethune* is permeated with the idea that to defeat imperialism, to liberate one's own nation and people, and to liberate the peoples of the world, the proletariat of all countries must unite, and must oppose narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism, and establish a lofty internationalist spirit without any selfish motives.

The editorial pointed out that China's recent successful nuclear test is a new achievement made possible by the great power unleashed under the guidance of "the three works."

The editorial said that in the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China achieved a new nuclear test, further breaking the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and dealt a heavy blow to the conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet collusion to strangle the revolutionary struggles of oppressed peoples and nations. It greatly encouraged and supported the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and encouraged and supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, making significant contributions to the defense of world peace.

The editorial finally emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought has blossomed into beautiful flowers among the tens of millions of young people who have grown up in China. Mao Zedong Thought is opening up a new era.

    日本《长周新闻》赞扬毛主席的三篇光辉著作
    “老三篇”是改造灵魂的强大武器
    新华社东京电　日本山口县出版的《长周新闻》，最近在一篇社论中，高度赞扬毛主席的三篇光辉著作《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，并且欢呼“老三篇”是培养共产主义新人的必修课，改造人们灵魂、促进思想革命化的强大思想武器。
    社论说，毛主席的《为人民服务》贯串着一切共产党员和国家机关工作人员都要彻底地为人民服务的思想；《愚公移山》贯串着自力更生、艰苦奋斗，只要经过努力就可以克服任何困难的思想；《纪念白求恩》贯串着为了打倒帝国主义，解放本民族和人民，解放世界的各民族和人民，一切国家的无产阶级都要联合起来，而且必须反对狭隘民族主义和狭隘爱国主义，树立毫无利己动机的崇高的国际主义精神的思想。
    社论指出，中国不久前成功地进行一次新的核爆炸，就是在“老三篇”教导下焕发出来的巨大力量所取得的新成就。
    社论说，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，中国取得了新的核爆炸的成功，进一步打破了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的核垄断，给美苏勾结企图扼杀被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争的阴谋以沉重的打击，大大地鼓舞和支持了正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民，支持和鼓舞了全世界反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命人民的斗争，为保卫世界和平做出了重大贡献。
    社论最后强调指出，毛泽东思想已经在中国新成长起来的千百万青少年中开放出鲜艳的花朵。毛泽东思想正在开辟着一个新纪元。
