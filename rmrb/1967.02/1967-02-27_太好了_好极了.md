Two Congolese (Brazzaville) friends residing in Cuba, upon receiving the French version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," eagerly began reading it together. As they read, they enthusiastically exclaimed, "This is the truth, wonderful!" The next day, one of them told a Chinese comrade, "Quotations from Chairman Mao is excellent, I will definitely carry it with me for life." He immediately opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud, "Revolution is not a dinner party, not an essay, not a painting, not embroidery; it cannot be so gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained, and magnanimous. Revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by one class overthrowing another." He said, "The Congolese (Brazzaville) people believe in Chairman Mao the most. Indeed, revolution is like this, revolution is insurrection."

    太好了　好极了
    两位居住在古巴的刚果（布）朋友最近得到法文版《毛主席语录》后，便迫不及待地一起朗读起来，一边读一边齐声欢呼：“这是真理，好极了。”第二天，他们当中的一位向中国同志表示：“《毛主席语录》太好了，我一定要一辈子把它带在身上。”他当场打开《毛主席语录》读道：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”他说：“我们刚果（布）人民最相信毛主席，的确，革命就是这样，革命就是暴动。”
