Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to seize power from the handful of capitalists within the Party from the bottom up is the fundamental task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a comprehensive counterattack against the bourgeoisie's repeated and rampant attacks over the past seventeen years.

In a socialist society, class struggle exists. This class struggle is concentrated in the issue of political power, specifically in the struggle between the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party to seize power and the proletariat's struggle to regain power.

After the proletariat seized national power, the reactionary bourgeoisie always sought to infiltrate the Party to find their agents. A handful of reactionary elements who have infiltrated the Party, in the places and departments they control, carry out "peaceful evolution" and implement bourgeois dictatorship. The proletariat must seize back all the power they have usurped to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, to ensure that our country will never change color, and to continue to advance victoriously along the path of socialism and communism.

The greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, discovered the law of class struggle in socialist society, personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and personally initiated and led the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. He put forward the correct theory and a series of policies and guidelines in the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalists within the Party. This is a great development of Marxism-Leninism and a great development of the theory of proletarian dictatorship. This development has epoch-making and universal significance.

The handful of capitalists within the Party are the most dangerous and principal enemies. These reactionary elements use the Party's name to distort Party discipline into a bourgeois discipline that suppresses the masses and opposes the revolution. This counter-revolutionary discipline must be thoroughly smashed.

All revolutionary cadres must stand up and, together with the revolutionary masses, resolutely fight against the handful of capitalists within the Party, regardless of their so-called "discipline." They are no longer revolutionary superiors but counter-revolutionary revisionists. In war, a revolutionary soldier, when a commander betrays and surrenders to the enemy, must not obey his commands but rather aim the gun at him. This is true in war and should also be true in political struggle.

For proletarian revolutionaries, it is necessary to smash counter-revolutionary discipline while consciously adhering to proletarian revolutionary discipline.

Lenin pointed out that to deny proletarian revolutionary discipline is "to completely disarm the proletariat and serve the bourgeoisie" and "to indulge in the petty-bourgeois anarchism, vacillation, inability to persist, inability to unite, and inability to act in unison, which will inevitably lead to the failure of any proletarian revolutionary movement."

Chairman Mao has always emphasized revolutionary discipline based on Leninist principles. Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out: We must resolutely oppose petty-bourgeois extremism and liberalism that destroys discipline. He taught us:

"The danger of extremist democracy is that it damages and even completely destroys the Party's organization, weakens and even completely annihilates the Party's fighting capacity, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, thus leading to the failure of the revolution."

"We must strengthen discipline education throughout the Party because unified discipline is a necessary condition for revolutionary victory."

What Lenin said in 1920 and what Chairman Mao said decades ago are very important for the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionaries who are seizing power from the handful of capitalists within the Party today.

The magnificent democratic movement of the proletariat over the past half year has smashed the counter-revolutionary discipline of the handful of capitalists within the Party, which is a great thing. However, we are not saying that we do not need any discipline at all, nor are we advocating extremist democracy, anarchism, liberalism, localism, and factionalism. These things are incompatible with the proletariat. If we do not overcome these things and strengthen proletarian revolutionary discipline, we will not be able to form a strong proletarian revolutionary force, fight against the enemy, correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and achieve victory in the revolution.

In the past, a small red political power could exist, the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines could be consolidated and developed, and the decisive victory of the War of Liberation could be achieved, all of which showed the importance of proletarian revolutionary discipline. Today, it is the same. Only by strengthening proletarian revolutionary discipline can we implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, truly achieve the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, form an invincible proletarian revolutionary army, and achieve victory in the struggle to seize power.

Extremist democracy, anarchism, liberalism, localism, and factionalism are all destructive of proletarian revolutionary discipline. These things, in the end, are about selfishness and individualism. All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary mass organizations must break away from selfishness, establish public spirit, break away from individualism, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. That is, while transforming the objective world, we must also transform our subjective world. This requires every revolutionary comrade to link their thoughts and actions, seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and the "Three Articles."

If we do not do this and allow these erroneous things to grow and develop, we will turn against ourselves and be used by the class enemy. At this critical moment in the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalists within the Party, every revolutionary comrade and every revolutionary mass organization must pay high attention to this.

Experience has shown that in the process of seizing power, the proletarian revolutionaries must, through consultation and preparation, establish a temporary power organ composed of responsible persons from revolutionary mass organizations, responsible persons from the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres from Party and government organs. This power organ must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This power organ must have authority.

There is no such thing as a supra-class authority. We must thoroughly overthrow bourgeois authority and resolutely establish proletarian authority, which is not to say that we are against all authority.

Some people are against all authority, which is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois anarchism. Engels, in his essay "On Authority," pointed out that united action is to organize, and organization requires authority. Engels thoroughly criticized the anti-authoritarians. He said:

"Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is undoubtedly the most authoritative thing in the world. A revolution is the act of one part of the population using guns, cannons, and other very authoritative means to force another part of the population to accept its will. And the victorious party often, out of necessity, has to use the threat of its weapons against the reactionaries to maintain its rule. If the Paris Commune had not used the authority of the armed people to oppose the bourgeoisie, could it have lasted more than a day? Conversely, is it not reasonable to blame the Commune for not using this authority enough? In short, one of two things must happen. Either the anti-authoritarians do not know what they are talking about, in which case they are merely spreading confusion; or they know this, in which case they are betraying the cause of the proletariat. In both cases, they are only serving the reactionaries."

Without authority, there can be no organized revolutionary action, let alone revolutionary victory. This was true in the years of revolutionary war. Today, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalists within the Party is also the same.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the highest authority of the proletariat. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the highest authority of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Any temporary power organ leading the struggle to seize power that implements this correct line is certainly authoritative and must be authoritative. The proletarian revolutionaries should take it upon themselves to be such an authority. This authority is the authority of the proletariat.

The temporary power organ leading the struggle to seize power has the power to implement dictatorship over the class enemy. Toward the handful of diehard capitalists within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society, it is necessary to deprive them of their democratic rights and there is no equality to be spoken of.

The temporary power organ leading the struggle to seize power implements democratic centralism within the people, that is, democracy on a centralized basis and centralism on a democratic basis. In this great revolution, the broadest democracy must be implemented, and the highest degree of centralism must also be implemented. All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary organizations must consciously adhere to revolutionary discipline and must act according to the principles of democratic centralism and cannot act arbitrarily.

The lesson of the Paris Commune using too little authority must be learned. The temporary power organ and its responsible persons leading the struggle to seize power under Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must have the courage of proletarian revolutionaries, fully use proletarian revolutionary authority, lead the broad masses, and successfully complete the historical task of seizing power.

    论无产阶级的革命纪律和革命权威
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    在无产阶级专政条件下，发动亿万群众，自下而上地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，这是无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务。这是对于资产阶级十七年来多次猖狂进攻的总反击。
    在社会主义社会里，存在着阶级斗争，这种阶级斗争集中地表现在政权问题上，表现在资产阶级及其在党内的代理人篡夺政权和无产阶级向他们夺权斗争的问题上。
    无产阶级夺取了全国政权以后，反动的资产阶级总是用打进来、拉出去的办法，在党内寻找它的代理人。一小撮钻进党内的当权的反动家伙，在他们盘踞的一些地方和部门，实行“和平演变”，实行资产阶级专政。无产阶级必须把他们篡夺的一切权力夺回来，才能巩固无产阶级专政，才能保证我们的国家永不变色，永远沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路胜利前进。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志，发现了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，亲自发动和领导无产阶级文化大革命，亲自发动和领导无产阶级革命派大联合，团结广大群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，提出了正确的理论和一系列的方针、政策。这是对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展，对无产阶级专政学说的伟大发展。这个发展具有划时代的普遍的意义。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是最危险、最主要的敌人。这些反动家伙，维持他们反动统治权力的一个重要武器，就是盗用党的名义，把党的纪律歪曲成压制群众、反对革命的资产阶级的纪律。对于这种反革命的纪律，必须彻底砸碎。
    一切革命的干部，都应当站出来，和革命群众一起，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派坚决地进行斗争，而不管他们的什么“纪律”。他们已经不是革命的上级，而是反革命的修正主义分子。在战争中，一个革命战士，当某个指挥员叛变投敌的时候，是决不能服从他的指挥，相反的，要把枪口对准他。战争中是这样，政治斗争中也应该是这样。
    对于无产阶级革命战士说来，必须粉碎反革命的纪律，同时，必须自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律。
    列宁指出，否认无产阶级革命纪律，“就等于为资产阶级效劳而完全解除无产阶级的武装”，“就等于放纵小资产阶级的散漫、动摇、不能坚持、不能团结、不能统一行动等劣根性，而纵容这些劣根性，就必然使无产阶级的任何革命运动都遭到失败。”
    毛主席从来就是根据列宁主义的原则，强调革命的纪律性。毛主席多次指出：必须坚决反对小资产阶级的极端民主化，反对破坏纪律的自由放任主义。他教导我们说：
    “极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”
    “要在全党加强纪律教育，因为统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件。”　　　　　　　　　　
    列宁在一九二○年说过的这些话，毛主席在几十年前说过的这些话，对于今天正在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众说来，都是十分重要的。
    半年多来的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级的大民主运动，冲垮了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命纪律，这是天大的好事。但是，我们绝不是不要任何纪律，绝不是提倡极端民主化，无政府主义，自由主义，本位主义，小团体主义等等。这些东西，同无产阶级是水火不相容的。不克服这些东西，不加强无产阶级的革命纪律性，就不能组成坚强的无产阶级的革命队伍，就不能同敌人战斗，就不能正确地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不能取得革命的胜利。
    过去，一小块红色政权能够存在，敌后抗日根据地能够巩固和发展，解放战争能够取得决战的胜利，都说明了无产阶级革命纪律的重要性。今天，也是这样。只有加强无产阶级的革命纪律，才能贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，才能真正实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，组成攻无不克的无产阶级革命大军，取得夺权斗争的胜利。
    极端民主化，无政府主义，自由主义，本位主义，小团体主义等等，都是破坏无产阶级的革命纪律的。这些东西，归根到底，就是一个私字，就是个人主义。一切革命的同志，一切革命的群众组织，都应当大破私字，大立公字，大破个人主义，大立毛泽东思想。也就是说，在改造客观世界的同时，要改造自己的主观世界。这就要求每一个革命同志，联系自己的思想和行动，认真地活学活用毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、“老三篇”等光辉著作。如果不这样做，听任那些错误的东西滋长和发展，就会走向自己的反面，就会被阶级敌人所利用。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的关键时刻，每一个革命同志，每一个革命的群众组织，都必须高度注意这一点。
    经验证明，在夺权斗争的过程中，无产阶级革命派，必须经过酝酿协商，建立由革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的负责人和党政机关的革命领导干部组成的临时权力机构。这个权力机构，必须是坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。这个权力机构，必须是有权威的。
    超阶级的权威，是没有的。我们要彻底打倒资产阶级的权威，坚决树立无产阶级的权威，并不是反对一切权威。
    有些人反对一切权威，这是小资产阶级劣根性的表现，这是无政府主义的表现。
    恩格斯在《论权威》一文中指出，联合活动就是组织起来，而组织起来必须要有权威。恩格斯彻底地批判了反权威主义者。他说：
      “这些先生曾经见过一次革命没有？革命无疑是天下最有权威的东西。革命是一部分居民用刀枪大炮，即用非常有权威的手段强迫另一部分居民接受其意志的动作。而获得胜利的政党往往迫于必要，不得不藉自己武器所给予反动派的威吓，来维持自己的统治。要是巴黎公社不曾凭藉武装人民的权威来反对资产阶级，那它能支持到一天以上么？反过来说，我们不是有理由因为公社把这个权威运用得太少而加以责备么？总之，二者必居其一。或者是反权威主义者自己不知道自己所说的是些什么，那末他们就仅仅是散布糊涂观念；或者是他们知道这一点，那末他们就是背叛无产阶级的事业。在前后两种场合，他们都只是为反动派效劳。”
    没有权威，就没有有组织的革命行动，更不会有革命的胜利。在革命战争的年代里是这样。今天，在无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，也是这样。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，是无产阶级的最高权威。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是无产阶级文化大革命的最高权威。凡是执行这条正确路线的领导夺权斗争的临时权力机构，当然是应该有权威的，也一定是有权威的。无产阶级革命派要当仁不让地做这样的权威。这个权威，是无产阶级的权威。
    领导夺权斗争的临时权力机构，有权力对阶级敌人实行专政。对待党内一小撮顽固的走资本主义道路的当权派，对待社会上的牛鬼蛇神，就是要剥夺他们的民主权利，同他们没有什么平等可说。
    领导夺权斗争的临时权力机构，在人民内部实行民主集中制，即在民主基础上的集中，在集中指导下的民主。在这次大革命中，实行最广泛的民主，也要实行最高度的集中。一切革命同志，一切革命组织，都应当自觉地遵守革命纪律，必须按照民主集中制的原则办事，不能各行其是。
    巴黎公社把权威运用得太少的教训，必须记取。执行毛主席革命路线、领导夺权斗争的临时权力机构和它的负责人，要拿出无产阶级革命家的胆略，充分地运用无产阶级的革命权威，率领广大群众，胜利地完成夺权斗争的历史任务。
