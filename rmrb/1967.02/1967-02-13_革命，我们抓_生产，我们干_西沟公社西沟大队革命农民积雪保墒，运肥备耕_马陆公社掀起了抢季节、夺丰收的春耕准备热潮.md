West Gorge Brigade of West Gorge Commune in Shanxi's Pingxun County, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, formed the Red Guards East Wind Combat Team and revolutionary peasants. They are determined to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. They say: We must vigorously promote the revolution and spring plowing, and strive for a double victory in the cultural revolution and agricultural production this year.

On the first day of the Spring Festival, as soon as it was light, members of the East Wind Combat Team and revolutionary peasants braved the snow, each carrying a hoe and a basket, rushing to the fields to accumulate snow for moisture retention and transport fertilizer for spring plowing. As they worked hard, they sang, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, we strive for victory." Revolutionary youngsters Li Qiu'e and Zhang Xian'e, only fifteen or sixteen years old, insisted on carrying fertilizer despite the team's concern that they might fall in the snow. They said:

"We fear no sacrifice in revolution. Without fear of death, there is no revolution. With Chairman Mao leading the way, we will never fall! Today, we are not just carrying fertilizer; we are carrying the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the determination of the people of West Gorge to grasp the revolution and promote production!"

Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants fought side by side in production. Whatever snow and mud were on the community members' bodies, the same amount was on theirs. The poor and lower-middle peasants highly praised Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, saying they were good cadres cultivated by Chairman Mao, who put politics in command and worked among the masses. Militia company commander Qin Zhouze, despite being ill, also came out to transport fertilizer with the poor and lower-middle peasants. After people found out, they advised him to go back and rest. He immediately loudly recited Chairman Mao's words: "The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not do, who will?" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: We poor and lower-middle peasants are the pillars of the sky and earth. In revolution, we are the vanguards. In production, we are the pioneers. We grasp the revolution; we work on production! We not only want to smash an old world but also want to fight for a bright red new world. Chairman Mao trusts us poor and lower-middle peasants, entrusting us with the dual burdens of revolution and production. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, seize the opportunity, and quickly launch a spring plowing production upsurge!

On February 9, more than 450 community members braved the wind and snow to transport fertilizer, accumulate snow, repair agricultural tools, and inspect seeds, working hard for spring plowing preparation. The attendance rate reached 96%. They transported more than 2,000 loads of fertilizer and accumulated more than 3,500 loads of snow, increasing labor efficiency by more than 20% compared to usual. At this critical moment when spring plowing is about to begin, Li Shunda, representing all the revolutionary rebels of West Gorge, firmly declared: We will forever read Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao's words, leading the people of West Gorge to follow Chairman Mao and make revolution and build the country. We will implement the great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao, firmly carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and strive for a double victory in revolution and production in 1967.

Newspaper of the People's Republic of China, Shanghai, February 12 - Farmers of Malu Commune in Jiading County, Shanghai, in the face of the approaching spring plowing busy season, firmly adhere to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promote the revolution, and strive for production. They have launched a wave of spring plowing preparation work.

Recently, when the revolutionary rebels of this commune rose up in rebellion, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and stubborn elements who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line stirred up a counter-revolutionary economism wind. The revolutionary rebel fighters and poor and lower-middle peasants immediately saw through this plot and struggled against those who incited a large number of peasants to leave their production posts. However, these bad elements were not willing to admit defeat and attempted to stop production to suppress the revolution. The revolutionary rebel fighters and poor and lower-middle peasants reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not do, who will?" They drew boundless strength from Chairman Mao's teachings and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, formed two leadership teams for revolution and production.

The revolutionary rebel fighters and the masses of Malu Commune realized that doing well in spring plowing production would lay a solid foundation for achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production for the whole year; this year's spring plowing production is in the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and how well this year's agricultural production is done will affect the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To better prepare for spring plowing, the revolutionary peasant rebel headquarters of this commune recently held an emergency meeting on "grasp revolution, promote production," conducting ideological mobilization among revolutionary cadres and the masses to make everyone fully realize the importance of doing well in this year's spring plowing production. Each production team also held community meetings, with community members taking the lead, pooling their wisdom, and jointly discussing and researching spring plowing preparation work. Community members all expressed that they would adhere to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production," and do a better job in spring plowing and spring plowing preparation. Revolutionary rebel fighters and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, we strive for victory." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, overcame all difficulties, vigorously promoted spring plowing preparation work, and vigorously promoted field management work, universally applying fertilizer to wheat and rapeseed; rice and cotton seeds are also being selected.

Revolutionary rebel fighters and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants braved the cold wind and snow, treading on the ice, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, digging ditches to accumulate fertilizer, leveling the land, working with increasing vigor. So far, Malu Brigade has filled five abandoned ditches and leveled more than forty acres of land. This Spring Festival, revolutionary rebel fighters and poor and lower-middle peasants broke the old habit of not working during the Spring Festival. On the first day of the New Year, many male community members carried manure buckets to apply manure to wheat and rapeseed, and many female community members carried baskets to level the land. The male and female community members of Wufang Production Team in Chen Village Brigade, except for those who went to the county for a meeting, almost all went to work in the rain. Revolutionary rebel fighters, wearing red armbands, worked with even more enthusiasm, carrying mud to fill ditches, coming and going like shuttles. They said: "Celebrating the Spring Festival with revolution, seizing the season, and striving for a bumper harvest is truly invigorating." During rest, they also studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)."

    革命，我们抓  生产，我们干
    西沟公社西沟大队革命农民积雪保墒，运肥备耕
    马陆公社掀起了抢季节、夺丰收的春耕准备热潮
    据新华社太原十二日电　山西平顺县西沟公社西沟大队以贫下中农为主体组成的西沟毛泽东思想红卫兵东风战斗队和革命农民，决心一双铁肩挑起革命、生产两副重担。他们说：我们要大抓革命，狠促春耕，誓夺文化革命和今年农业生产的双胜利。
    春节那一天，天刚发亮，东风战斗队的队员和革命农民就冒雪一个个扛上锄头，拿起箩筐，奔赴田间，积雪保墒，运肥备耕。他们一边大干，一边高歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”革命小将李秋娥、张先娥才十五、六岁，队里怕她们在雪地里运肥跌倒，安排她们去干别的农活，她们坚决不肯，说：
  “革命不怕死，怕死不革命。有毛主席他老人家给我们指路，我们就永远跌不倒！我们今天运的不是肥，是咱贫下中农的革命造反志气，是咱西沟人抓革命、促生产的决心！”
    革命干部和广大贫下中农在生产中并肩战斗。社员身上有多少雪，沾多少泥，他们身上也有多少雪，也沾多少泥。贫下中农非常赞扬李顺达、申纪兰，说他们政治挂帅，深入群众，是毛主席培养出来的好干部。民兵营长秦周则，不顾身体有病也跑出来和贫下中农一起运肥。人们发现以后，劝他回去休息，他立即高声朗读毛主席语录：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”广大贫下中农激动地说：我们贫下中农是顶天立地的台柱子，在革命当中是闯将，在生产当中是先锋。革命，我们抓；生产，我们干！我们不但要砸烂一个旧世界，我们还要杀出一个红彤彤的新世界来。毛主席他老人家信得过咱贫下中农，把革命、生产两副重担交给咱贫下中农，咱决不辜负毛主席他老人家的希望，抓紧时机，迅速掀起一个春耕生产的高潮！
    二月九日这一天，四百五十多名社员冒着风雪运肥、积雪、修理农具、检查种籽，为备耕紧张战斗着，出勤率达到了百分之九十六。他们运肥二千余担，积雪三千五百多担，比平时劳动效率提高了百分之二十多。在这春耕就要开始的关键时候，李顺达代表西沟革命造反派全体战士坚决地表示：永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，带领西沟人民跟着毛主席他老人家闹革命，搞建设。实行革命工人、革命农民、革命的领导干部大联合，坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取一九六七年革命生产双丰收、双胜利。
    新华社上海十二日电　上海嘉定县马陆公社农民革命造反派和广大贫下中农，在春耕大忙季节快要到来的时候，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，大抓革命，狠促生产，掀起了春耕准备工作的热潮。
    不久前，当这个公社的革命造反派战士起来造反时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，刮起了反革命经济主义的妖风。革命造反派战士和贫下中农一下就识破了这个阴谋，把那些煽动大批农民离开生产岗位的坏家伙揪出来进行了斗争。但是，这些坏家伙并不甘心失败，又企图以停生产来压革命。农民革命造反派战士们，重温了毛主席的教导：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”　
  　他们从毛主席的教导里得到了无穷无尽的力量，同贫下中农和革命干部一起，组成了革命和生产两套领导班子。
    马陆公社革命造反派战士和革命群众认识到，搞好春耕生产，就能为夺取全年农业生产丰收打下牢固的基础；今年的春耕生产又处在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，今年的农业生产搞得好不好将关系到无产阶级文化大革命的开展。为了更好地做好春耕准备工作，这个公社革命农民造反司令部最近召开了“抓革命，促生产”的紧急会议，在革命干部和革命群众中，进行思想动员，使大家充分认识到搞好今年春耕生产的重要意义。各生产队还召开了社员大会，由社员当家作主，群策群力，共同讨论、研究春耕准备工作。社员们都表示，要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把春耕和春耕准备工作做得更好。革命造反派战士和广大贫下中农学习了毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，排除万难，大抓春耕准备工作，大抓田间管理工作，对三麦、油菜普遍追施肥料；水稻、棉花的种籽，也正在着手进行粒选。
    革命造反派战士和广大贫下中农冒着寒风雨雪，踏着冰霜，唱着毛主席语录歌，开沟积肥，平整土地，越干越有劲。到目前为止，马陆大队已填了五条废浜，平整了四十多亩土地。今年春节，革命造反派战士和贫下中农，打破了往年春节不出工的老习惯，年初一早上，许多男社员挑着粪桶，给三麦油菜施上大粪，许多女社员挑着畚箕，平整土地。陈村大队五房生产队的男女社员除到县里开会以外，几乎全部冒雨出工。革命造反派战士佩着红袖章，干劲更足，挑泥填浜，往返如穿梭。他们说：“春节闹革命，抢季节，夺丰收，真有劲。”休息时，他们还学习了毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战
  （即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”
