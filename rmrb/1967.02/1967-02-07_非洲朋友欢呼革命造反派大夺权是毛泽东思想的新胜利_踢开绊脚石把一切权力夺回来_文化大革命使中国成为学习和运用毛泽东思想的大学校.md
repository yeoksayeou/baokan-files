Progressive individuals from some African countries have recently issued statements and made remarks, enthusiastically hailing the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels in various parts of China who have seized power from a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They pointed out that this is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

On January 30, Muhammad Dahane, a leader of the Somali Coast Liberation Front, issued a written statement to Xinhua News Agency in Mogadishu, saying: "The revolutionary masses of Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are launching a general offensive and thoroughly defeating a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. 'What these revolutionary organizations are doing is correct and very good.'"

The statement said: "The revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is the line to defend and further advance the socialist revolution. This is the line to eliminate the danger of revisionism and capitalist restoration. This line has achieved great victories."

The statement hailed: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the People's Republic of China led by the Communist Party of China!"

Sudanese student Karim said, "The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and other places in China seizing power from a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought. 'This is a new victory marking the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a new stage.' He said, 'The revolutionary rebels seizing power from a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a new guarantee for China to remain forever red.'"

Another Sudanese student, Farouk, said, "The Chinese revolutionary rebels seizing the power of those who have become obstacles on the road of revolution is indeed a very good thing. He said: 'Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese revolutionary rebels are adhering to the policy of 'grasp revolution, promote production.' This is the policy of Marxism-Leninism.'"

Sudanese student Salah said, "The Chinese revolutionary rebels have smashed the economicism adopted by counter-revolutionary revisionists, which is very good. He also said: 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a mass movement. In this movement, China has become a great school for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.'"

A Tanzanian driver named Msafiri said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is very good. China is uprooting capitalism and revisionism. This is very beneficial for the African people to eliminate the influence of imperialism on African soil. When refuting the imperialist slanders against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, he read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' He said, 'If the poor people of the world do not have the great Mao Zedong Thought, they cannot stand up.'"

    非洲朋友欢呼革命造反派大夺权是毛泽东思想的新胜利
    踢开绊脚石把一切权力夺回来
    文化大革命使中国成为学习和运用毛泽东思想的大学校
    据新华社三日讯　非洲一些进步人士最近发表声明和谈话，热烈欢呼中国各地革命造反派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺权的革命行动，并指出这是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    索马里海岸解放阵线领导成员穆罕默德·达汉一月三十日在摩加迪沙向新华社记者发表书面声明说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海革命群众组织正在发动总攻击，彻底打垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。“这些革命群众组织正在做的事情是正确的，好得很。”
    声明说：“以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线是保卫和进一步推进社会主义革命的路线。这是消除产生修正主义和资本主义复辟危险的路线。这条路线已取得了伟大胜利。”
    声明高呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国共产党领导的中华人民共和国万岁！”
    苏丹学生卡里姆说，中国上海和其他地方的革命造反派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。“这是标志着无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段的新胜利。”他说，革命造反派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，是使中国永远保持鲜红颜色的新的保证。
  苏丹另一位学生法鲁克说，中国的革命造反派夺取那些已成为革命前进道路上绊脚石的人的权，这的确是一件大好事。他说：“中国的革命造反派在毛泽东思想的指导下，坚持抓革命、促生产的方针。这是马克思列宁主义的方针。”
    苏丹学生萨利赫说，中国革命造反派粉碎了反革命修正主义分子采取的经济主义，这好得很。他还说：“中国的文化大革命是一个广泛的群众运动。在这个运动中，中国变成了学习和运用毛泽东思想的大学校。”
    坦桑尼亚一位名叫姆萨菲里的司机说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命好得很。中国正在挖资本主义和修正主义的根子。这对非洲人民消除殖民主义在非洲土地上的影响也是非常有利的。这位坦桑尼亚工人在驳斥帝国主义对中国文化大革命的诬蔑时朗读了一段毛主席语录：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他说，世界上的穷人如果离开了伟大的毛泽东思想，他们就站不起来。
