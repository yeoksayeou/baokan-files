Japanese revolutionary people are firmly struggling against revisionists. A new Afro-Asian solidarity organization has been established in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

According to a report from the *Changzhou News*, the original Yamaguchi Prefecture Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee held a board meeting on the 11th. At the meeting, 28 board members, including Chairman Shigemura Yosaku and Vice Chairman Harada Chōji, who adhere to the correct line and principles, engaged in a fierce struggle with a small group of revisionists over whether to support the "Joint Statement" signed by the representatives of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees of China and Japan in October of last year, as well as the issue of Sino-Japanese friendship. They mercilessly exposed and struck down the evil deeds of Japanese revisionists who do not oppose U.S. imperialism, follow Soviet revisionism, and sabotage the solidarity of the Afro-Asian peoples and the peoples of China and Japan. Subsequently, on the 14th, they issued a statement announcing the establishment of the "Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, Yamaguchi Prefecture Branch." They also expressed their firm support for the fifth conference of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization scheduled to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement strongly condemns the small group of Japanese revisionists within the original Yamaguchi Prefecture Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee for slandering the great leader Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, for undermining the principles of the Afro-Asian solidarity movement, for sabotaging the fifth conference scheduled to be held in Beijing, and for undermining the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

The statement expresses firm support for the joint statement signed by the representatives of the Afro-Asian solidarity organizations of China and Japan. It emphasizes the need to raise high the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism, the banner of opposing modern revisionism, and the banner of solidarity between the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for national independence and liberation.

The China Research Institute Expels Anti-China Elements

According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, the China Research Institute of Japan held a staff meeting on the 10th and decided to sever ties with the revisionist leadership of the Japanese Communist Party that executes anti-China policies and with the saboteurs who follow them, and to expel nine saboteurs.

A decision passed at the staff meeting states: In order to make the study of Chinese issues conform to the purpose of Sino-Japanese friendship, anti-China elements must be expelled. The meeting, with an overwhelming majority of votes, decided to expel nine saboteurs, including Hirano Yoshitarō, Yonezawa Hideo, Kanamaru Ichio, and Kasahara Chikage.

The meeting also approved the decision made by the board of the research institute on December 23 of last year to remove Hirano Yoshitarō from his position as director, and to remove Hirano, Yonezawa, Kanamaru from their positions as directors, and Kasahara from his position as secretary. A new director, Yamashita Ryūzō, was elected.

The Press Alliance Resolutely Opposes the Anti-China Conspiracy of U.S. Imperialism, Japanese Reactionaries, and Modern Revisionism

According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, the Japan Press Alliance held a meeting in Tokyo on the evening of the 15th and issued a declaration, deciding to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline for action and to strive for the realization of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival.

The Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival, originally scheduled to be held last autumn, was unable to be held on time due to the obstruction and sabotage by U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and Soviet modern revisionists and their old and new followers. Since then, the Japanese people have been fighting for the holding of this festival.

The declaration of the Japan Press Alliance states that the realization of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival is one of the most important struggles of the Japanese revolutionary people at present. We will wage an unyielding struggle against the sabotage by U.S. imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism, and smash all their conspiracies.

The declaration states that the guiding principle of our struggle is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We will seriously study Mao Zedong Thought in this struggle, temper ourselves, and arm ourselves. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    日本记者同盟的宣言说，实现第二届日中青年友好大联欢，是日本革命人民的当前最重要的斗争之一。我们对美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义的破坏，要进行不屈不挠的斗争，粉碎它们的一切阴谋。
