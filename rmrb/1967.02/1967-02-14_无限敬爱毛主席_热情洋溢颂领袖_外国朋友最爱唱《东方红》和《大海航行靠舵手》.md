Every day, numerous foreign friends from all over the world visit our great country. They have seen that our nation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, has become a formidable bastion of world revolution. They hold even greater respect and affection for our great leader. During their travels, they often sing with fervor songs like "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao.

On a flight from Wuhan to Changsha, members of the Albanian Song and Dance Troupe sang enthusiastically with Chinese comrades, "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman." They also performed the song and dance "Long Live Chairman Mao" in the narrow cabin, reflecting their sincere affection for Chairman Mao.

A few Vietnamese guests, after singing "The Great Leader Mao Zedong" with the flight attendants, held the attendants' hands and said, "I deeply feel the happiness of the Chinese people in the era of Mao Zedong and their love for Chairman Mao."

On a flight from Guangzhou to Beijing, a few Thai friends learned "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" and a song based on Chairman Mao's quotations. They expressed their gratitude to the flight attendants and said excitedly, "Now the Chinese people and people around the world love Chairman Mao so much, but in Thailand, we do not have the freedom to sing these songs. You are so fortunate." As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes.

In the waiting lounge at Guangzhou Airport, on one occasion, more than ten Nepali friends sang enthusiastically with Chinese comrades, praising our great leader Chairman Mao. They carefully followed the sheet music and sang "The East Is Red" three times, their spirits soaring higher with each rendition. The Nepali friends said, "With Mao Zedong in the world, not only are you happy, but we are also happy, and all the people of the world are happy." Then, they sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" with great emotion. They also asked the translator to give the command, "One, two, three," and then recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison. After finishing, they sang the song based on Chairman Mao's quotations with great emotion.

Many foreign friends love to sing songs praising our great leader Chairman Mao. Wherever they are, they seize every opportunity to ask Chinese comrades to teach them. An elderly foreign friend, after learning the first verse of "The East Is Red," said, "My memory is not good, I can't learn it, but I have the confidence to master it." A Japanese friend also expressed, "I will make up my mind, overcome all difficulties, learn Chinese revolutionary songs, and teach my wife and children when I return home." As they sang loudly, they raised their thumbs, expressing their admiration for Chairman Mao.

    无限敬爱毛主席　热情洋溢颂领袖
    外国朋友最爱唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》
    本报讯　每天都有许多来自世界各地的外国朋友在我们伟大的祖国进行访问。他们看到了我们的国家在毛主席的英明领导下，已成为世界革命的坚强堡垒，对我们伟大的领袖更加崇敬和爱戴。他们在旅途中经常热情高歌《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，来表达他们对毛主席的无限热爱。
    在从武汉到长沙航程中的飞机上，阿尔巴尼亚歌舞团的战友们同中国同志一起热情洋溢地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，并且还在狭小的机舱里表演了歌舞《万岁毛主席》。他们表演得那么认真，充分反映出他们无限热爱毛主席的真挚感情。
    有几位越南贵宾和乘务员一起歌唱《伟大的领袖毛泽东》之后，拉着乘务员的手说：“我深深地体会到中国人民在毛泽东时代的幸福和对毛主席的热爱。”
    在由广州飞往北京的飞机上，几个泰国朋友学会了《大海航行靠舵手》和一首毛主席语录歌。他们对乘务员表示感谢，并且激动地说：“现在中国人民和世界人民这样热爱毛主席，但在泰国却没有唱这些歌曲的自由。你们太幸福了。”他说话的时候，禁不住热泪盈眶。
    在广州机场候机室里，有一次，十几位尼泊尔朋友和中国同志一道，热情洋溢地放声歌唱伟大的领袖毛主席。他们认真地看着歌谱反复唱了三遍《东方红》，情绪一遍比一遍高昂。尼泊尔朋友说：“世界上有了毛泽东，不但你们幸福，我们也幸福，全世界人民都幸福。”然后，他们又激动地唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》。他们还请翻译发口令：“一、二、三”，然后一齐高声朗读毛主席语录，读完之后又激动地唱起了毛主席语录歌。
    许多外国朋友非常喜爱歌唱我们伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲，他们无论在哪里，只要有机会就请中国同志教他们唱。一位已经上了年纪的外国朋友学会《东方红》第一段歌词后说：“我的脑子不好使，学不好，但我有信心学会它。”一位日本朋友也表示：“我要下定决心，排除万难，学会中国革命歌曲，回去还要教会我的妻子和孩子们。”他们一面放声歌唱，一面翘起大拇指，表示对毛主席的敬爱。
