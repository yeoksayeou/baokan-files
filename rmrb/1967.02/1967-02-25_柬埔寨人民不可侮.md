American imperialism is running rampant everywhere, placing itself in a position of enmity with all the peoples of the world, making itself increasingly isolated.

The People of Cambodia Are Not to Be Insulted

While intensifying the expansion of its war of aggression in Vietnam, American imperialism has recently launched unprecedented large-scale incursions into Cambodia. This extremely serious military provocation is a new heinous crime committed by American imperialism against the people of Cambodia and all the peoples of Indochina.

American imperialism has always regarded Cambodia, which adheres to a policy of peaceful neutrality, as a thorn in its side and a stumbling block to its aggression in Indochina. It has used every conceivable means to try to overthrow the Royal Government of Cambodia and turn Cambodia into its colony and base for aggression. American imperialism not only engages in conspiracies, assassinations, and subversive activities but also supports its lackeys in Thailand and the puppet regime in South Vietnam in repeatedly and openly violating Cambodia's territory, airspace, and waters, and in brutally pressuring Cambodia. Just this year, the Thai military has invaded Cambodia on several occasions, laying mines and injuring and killing many Cambodian farmers. On February 2, a band of about fifty armed Thai thugs invaded Cambodia's Battambang Province and abducted forty-one forestry workers. American troops and the Saigon puppet army have also repeatedly invaded Cambodian territory, killing and injuring many Cambodian farmers. These acts of aggression by American imperialism and its lackeys have aroused the great indignation of the Cambodian people and all peace-loving peoples of the world.

The serious incidents of aggression against Cambodia are part of American imperialism's scheme to intensify its aggression in Indochina. At present, American imperialism is colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership clique to carry out the schemes of "forcing peace through war" and "bombing to force peace" against the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique's treacherous betrayal of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and its deliberate connivance at American imperialism's policy of aggression have greatly emboldened American imperialism. American imperialism's large-scale aggression against Cambodia is inseparable from the encouragement of the Soviet revisionist clique of traitors. This fact once again proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is a shameful accomplice in American imperialism's aggression against the countries of Indochina.

The Cambodian people are not afraid of threats, nor are they afraid of violence. They have resolutely fought against American imperialism's aggressive activities. This time, the Cambodian military and people have also given a resolute rebuff to the aggression of American imperialism and its lackeys, driving the aggressors out of Cambodia. The Cambodian military and people are great; they have fought well! American imperialism has always been a bully, strong against the weak and weak against the strong. It is a paper tiger with a strong exterior but a weak interior. The Cambodian people are not afraid of American imperialism's threats. If they unite and stand up to it, they will certainly be able to smash any of its aggressive schemes. Prince Norodom Sihanouk has sternly warned American imperialists and their lackeys that Cambodia is not afraid of them and that Cambodia will retaliate tooth for tooth against their attacks. He said, "Once war is declared, no matter what situation we may encounter, we will fight to the end, and we are confident that we will win the final victory." This fully expresses the heroic spirit and firm will of the Cambodian people to defend their national dignity and independence.

The Chinese people have always resolutely supported the just struggle of the Cambodian people against American imperialism and for national independence. The Royal Government of Cambodia and its people have also resolutely supported the struggle of the Chinese people against American imperialism. The deep friendship between our two peoples, forged in the common struggle against American imperialism, has been tested. If American imperialism dares to expand its war of aggression to Cambodia, the seven hundred million Chinese people will swear to be the backbone of the Cambodian people. We will unshakably stand with the Cambodian people and fight to the end to thoroughly smash American imperialism's aggressive schemes.

    美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。
    柬埔寨人民不可侮
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义在加紧扩大侵越战争的同时，最近连日对柬埔寨发动了空前规模的入侵。这个极端严重的军事挑衅，是美帝国主义对柬埔寨人民和整个印度支那人民犯下的新的滔天罪行。
    美帝国主义一向把坚持和平中立外交政策的柬埔寨，看作是它侵略印度支那的眼中钉、肉中刺，千方百计地想要颠覆柬埔寨王国政府，把柬埔寨变成它的殖民地和侵略基地。美帝国主义不但耍阴谋、搞暗杀和颠覆活动，而且支持它的走狗泰国当局和南越傀儡集团，不断公开侵犯柬埔寨领土、领空、领海，穷凶极恶地对柬埔寨施加压力。仅仅今年以来，泰国军队就多次侵入柬埔寨，埋设地雷，炸伤和打伤柬埔寨的农民多人。二月二日，泰国武装匪徒约五十人侵入柬埔寨马德望省，劫走林业工人四十一名。美军和南越伪军也不断侵犯柬埔寨的领土，打死打伤柬埔寨农民多人。美帝国主义及其走狗的这种侵略罪行，激起了柬埔寨人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的极大的愤慨。
    对柬埔寨的严重侵犯事件，是美帝国主义加紧侵略印度支那的阴谋的一个组成部分。目前，美帝国主义正勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，对越南人民大搞“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。苏修领导集团对越南人民抗美救国斗争的无耻叛徒行径和对美帝国主义的侵略政策的蓄意纵容，大大助长了美帝国主义的侵略气焰。美帝国主义这次大规模侵犯柬埔寨，同苏修叛徒集团的鼓励是分不开的。这个事实再一次证明，苏修领导集团是美帝国主义侵略印度支那各国的可耻帮凶。
    柬埔寨人民不怕威胁，不畏强暴，同美帝国主义的侵略活动进行了坚决的斗争。这一次，柬埔寨军民同样给予了美帝国主义及其走狗的侵犯以坚决的反击，把侵略者赶出了柬埔寨。柬埔寨军民是好样的，他们打得好！美帝国主义从来都是欺软怕硬的。它是外强中干的纸老虎。柬埔寨人民不怕美帝国主义的恐吓，团结起来，同它顶、同它斗，就一定能够粉碎它的任何侵略阴谋。西哈努克亲王曾经严正警告美帝国主义者及其走狗说，柬埔寨不怕他们，柬埔寨将以牙还牙地反击他们的进攻。他说，“一旦宣战，不管我们可能遇到什么情况，我们将干到底，并且我们确信将赢得最后胜利。”这充分地表达了柬埔寨人民维护国家尊严和民族独立的英雄气概和坚强意志。
    中国人民一贯坚决支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争。柬埔寨王国政府和人民也一贯坚决支持中国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。我们两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的深厚友谊，是经过考验的。如果美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战争扩大到柬埔寨，七亿中国人民将誓为柬埔寨人民的后盾。我们将坚定不移地同柬埔寨人民站在一起，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略斗争到底。
