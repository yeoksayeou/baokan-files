The struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries is advancing with the force of thunder and the momentum of a thousand galloping horses.

The situation is excellent!

The most crucial task facing all revolutionary rebels at present is to establish the broadest united front of the proletarian revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the fundamental guarantees of the success of our cause."

The strength of a part of the people, a part of the organizations, compared with the great and arduous nature of our cause, is after all insignificant. Only broad revolutionary rebel organizations and broad revolutionary masses can unite, can our strength be invincible. Therefore, all revolutionary rebel organizations should, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, seriously attach importance to this problem.

We must establish a great united front of revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, and revolutionary students; we must establish a great united front of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and revolutionary cadres, to drown the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line in our great united front—the vast ocean of "people's war"!

The great united front we advocate is based on the fundamental interests of the proletarian revolutionary cause, based on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, in a word, based on the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

With this foundation, our comrades will be united as one, our ranks will be united as steel, unbreakable, indestructible, attacking like a tiger, defending like a mountain. With this foundation, we will have clear eyes and bright hearts, we will expose all the tricks of the class enemy to sow discord, we will timely eliminate the impurities within our ranks, making our ranks develop and grow healthily. With this foundation, we will be able to defeat all vicious enemies and plant the victory banner of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in every field of society!

		Break Completely with Anarchism

True proletarian revolutionary rebels must resolutely oppose anarchism.

Lenin pointed out: "The world outlook of the anarchists is the bourgeois world outlook in disguise." Anarchism is a reactionary and extremely harmful petty-bourgeois trend of thought. It starts from individualism, advocates extreme bourgeois "democracy," strongly opposes the iron discipline and democratic centralism within the proletarian revolutionary ranks, and opposes the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

Anarchism, liberalism, and banditry and other such thoughts are extremely harmful corrosive agents to the unity of the revolutionary ranks. If such thoughts dominate the revolutionary ranks, it will lead to the disintegration of the revolutionary ranks. Therefore, every revolutionary must completely break with such thoughts and wage an uncompromising struggle against them.

		Victory Is Not Achieved by a Few "Heroes"

To unite all forces that can be united, we must oppose sectarianism.

The essence of sectarianism is not believing in the masses.

Sectarians never rely on the masses and never think of relying on the masses. Because they never believe in the scientific truth that the masses have limitless creative power. They think that the victory of the revolutionary struggle is achieved only by a few "heroic figures." Therefore, they are very keen on a few people working hard alone, "struggling hard," the result of which can only be failure.

The thought of sectarianism is incompatible with Chairman Mao's scientific thought that "the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable." As Chairman Mao criticized: "The strategy of sectarianism is the strategy of a lonely individual. Sectarianism 'drives fish into the deep and birds into the woods,' driving 'thousands and thousands' and 'vast numbers' to the enemy's side, only earning the enemy's applause."

We proletarian revolutionary rebels must not have sectarianism. What we need is the broadest united front of the proletarian revolutionaries to put the enemy to death.

		Revolutionize in the Depths of the Soul

To establish the broadest united front of revolutionary forces, all revolutionary rebel organizations must put "public" first and regard revolutionary interests as the first priority.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the interests of the people." He also teaches us: "Every comrade should understand that the words and deeds of a Communist must take as the highest standard whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by the broadest masses of the people."

The fundamental purpose of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat we are engaged in is to break the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public." Therefore, for every revolutionary rebel, for every vanguard of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, not only must they be vanguards in the struggle to break the old and establish the new, but they must also be vanguards in breaking the "self" in their own thoughts and establishing the "public" in their own thoughts, revolutionizing in the depths of their souls.

Every revolutionary rebel should learn from Zhang Zedeng and Norman Bethune, who devoted their hearts and souls to the revolution and served the people wholeheartedly. In the struggle and in work, they should always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seek no fame, seek no gain, fear no hardship, fear no death, and be a faithful servant of the people.

Every revolutionary rebel should seriously listen to Chairman Mao's words, be full of enthusiasm for comrades, care for each other, love each other, and help each other in the revolutionary ranks; dare to criticize, be good at uniting; in the principle of unity in major directions, be lenient to others and strict with oneself; strive to unite the majority to work together.

To unite the majority and to consolidate the united front, we must establish a strong organizational consciousness in our minds. We must emphasize proletarian organization and discipline, proletarian democratic centralism. If we have no discipline, we will not be able to build a combat-effective and united army. Only with strong proletarian discipline will our ranks be invincible in the struggle!

In summary, to establish the broadest united front of the proletarian revolutionaries, all revolutionary rebel organizations and the broad revolutionary masses should actively take action, eliminate all erroneous thoughts within that are not conducive to uniting the majority, criticize all erroneous attitudes that are not conducive to unity, and stop all erroneous behaviors that are not conducive to unity.

Chairman Mao said: "The strength of this army lies in the fact that all those who participate in this army have conscious discipline; they are not fighting for the private interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the whole nation, they unite and fight. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army."

The earnest teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao are not only the sole purpose of every revolutionary rebel organization but also the sole purpose of our revolutionary united front. If anyone deviates from this purpose, they will inevitably fall into the stinking swamp of the bourgeoisie.

Comrades in the revolutionary rebel ranks! Let us, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to rebel, daring to struggle, and daring to fight, unite as one, concentrate our firepower, and thoroughly defeat those few reactionaries who are surrounded by the vast ocean of "people's war"—the revolutionary rebel united front, making them never rise again!

### 建立最广泛的革命造反派大联合

    建立最广泛的革命造反派大联合
    北京第八十中学延安战斗队
        当　务　之　急
    无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争正以雷霆万钧之力，万马奔腾之势向前发展。
    形势好得很！
    当前，一个最关键的任务摆在所有革命造反派的面前，那就是建立最广泛的无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    一部分人，一部分组织的力量，与我们从事的事业的伟大、艰巨性比较起来，毕竟是渺小的。只有广大的革命造反派组织，广大的革命群众联合起来，我们的力量才能无坚不摧。因此，一切革命造反派的组织，都应该以高度的革命责任感，严肃地重视这个问题。
    我们要建立起革命工人的大联合，革命农民的大联合，革命学生的大联合；要建立起工、农、兵、学和革命干部的广泛的大联合，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子淹没在我们的大联合——“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中！
    我们所提倡的大联合，是以无产阶级革命事业的根本利益为基础，是以毛主席所代表的无产阶级革命路线为基础，一句话，是以伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想为基础。
    有了这个基础，我们的同志就会团结得象一个人一样，我们的队伍就会团结得象钢铁一般，拖不垮，打不烂，攻如猛虎，守如泰山。有了这个基础，我们就会眼亮心明，就会揭穿阶级敌人一切挑拨离间的阴谋，就会及时地去掉队伍内部的杂质，使我们的队伍健康地发展、壮大。有了这个基础，我们就能战胜一切凶恶的敌人，把无产阶级文化大革命的胜利红旗插遍一切社会领域！
          同无政府主义彻底决裂
    真正的无产阶级革命造反派要坚决反对无政府主义。
    列宁指出：“无政府主义者的世界观，是改头换面的资产阶级世界观。”无政府主义是一种反动的极为有害的小资产阶级思潮。它以个人主义为出发点，极力主张资产阶级的“极端民主”，极力反对无产阶级革命队伍中的铁一般的纪律和民主集中制，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。
    无政府主义及自由主义、流寇主义等等思想，对革命队伍的团结是极为有害的腐蚀剂，这种思想如果统治了革命队伍，那将会产生涣散革命队伍的后果。因此，每一个革命者都应该与这种思想彻底决裂，并同它进行不调和的斗争。
      胜利不是少数“英雄”奋斗得来的
    为了团结一切可以团结的力量，我们必须反对关门主义。
    关门主义的本质就是不相信群众。
    关门主义者从来不依靠群众，也从来不想依靠群众。因为他们从来就不相信群众有无限的创造力这个科学真理。他们以为革命斗争的胜利，只是由少数“英雄人物”奋斗得来的。因此，他们非常热中于孤零零的几个人的“埋头苦干”，“艰苦奋斗”，其结果当然只能使工作遭到失败。
    关门主义思想，与毛主席的“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”这一科学思想，是水火不相容的。正如毛主席所批判的：“关门主义的策略则是孤家寡人的策略。关门主义‘为渊驱鱼，为丛驱雀’，把‘千千万万’和‘浩浩荡荡’都赶到敌人那一边去，只博得敌人的喝采。”
    我们无产阶级革命造反派一定不要关门主义，我们需要的，是置敌于死地的最广泛的无产阶级革命派的大联合。
          在灵魂深处闹革命
    为了建立起最广泛的革命力量的大联合，我们一切革命造反派组织都应该“公”字当头，以革命利益为第一生命。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”他还教导我们：“应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”
    当前，我们所从事的无产阶级文化大革命，其根本目的就是要破资产阶级的一个“私”字，立无产阶级的一个“公”字。因此，对于每一个革命造反者，每一个无产阶级文化大革命的闯将来说，不但要在大破四旧、大立四新的斗争中充当急先锋，同时也要做大破自己思想中的“私”字，大立自己思想中的“公”字，在自己灵魂深处闹革命的急先锋。
    每一个革命造反者，都应该学习张思德、白求恩的一心一意为革命，全心全意为人民服务的共产主义精神，在斗争中，在工作中，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，做一个人民的忠实勤务员。
    每个革命造反者，都要认真听毛主席的话，对同志满腔热忱，在革命队伍内互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助；要敢于批评，要善于团结；在大方向一致的原则下，要对人宽，责己严；要努力团结大多数人一道工作。
    为了团结大多数，为了巩固大联合，要在我们的思想中树立起坚强的组织观念。我们要大讲特讲无产阶级的组织纪律，无产阶级民主集中制。如果我们没有纪律，我们也就不可能建立起一支有战斗力的队伍，一支团结的队伍。只有有了坚强的无产阶级的纪律，我们的队伍才会在斗争中无往而不胜！
    总之，为了建立起最广泛的无产阶级革命派的大联合，所有的革命造反派组织，广大的革命群众，都应该积极地行动起来，肃清自己内部一切不利于团结大多数的错误思想，批判一切不利于团结的错误态度，制止一切不利于团结的错误行为。
    毛主席说：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”
    伟大领袖毛主席的谆谆教导，不但是我们每一个革命造反派组织的唯一宗旨，它同样是我们革命大联合的唯一宗旨。如果谁背离了这个宗旨，它就必然陷入资产阶级的臭泥坑。
    广大的革命造反派战友们！让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，发扬敢于革命，敢于斗争，敢于造反的革命大无畏精神，同心协力，集中火力，将那些处于“人民战争”的汪洋大海——革命造反派大联合的重重包围之中的一小撮反动分子彻底打倒，使它们永世不得翻身！
