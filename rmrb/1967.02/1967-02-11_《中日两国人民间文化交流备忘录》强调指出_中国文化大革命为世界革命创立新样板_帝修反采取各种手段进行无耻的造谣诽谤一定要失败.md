Representatives of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association today signed the "Memorandum on Cultural Exchange Between the Peoples of China and Japan." The memorandum enthusiastically praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, as having created a new model for the world revolution. This has had an immeasurable impact on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world, on the development of progressive cultural undertakings worldwide, and has opened up a new situation for cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.

The memorandum states that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois worldview, and establishing the proletarian worldview. They are seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, uprooting the sprouts of revisionism and capitalist restoration, achieving great victories, and ensuring that the great People's Republic of China will never change color. They will carry the socialist revolution through to the end, thus creating a new model for the world revolution.

The memorandum condemns the imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, Soviet modern revisionists, and their various followers for using various means to engage in shameless slander, even resorting to fascist violence, in a desperate attempt to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat. They aim to sabotage the great influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution among the peoples of the world and Japan. The memorandum points out that their struggle against the historical tide of humanity, their retrograde and reactionary resistance, will surely fail. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat will surely achieve final victory and gain increasing support from the peoples of the world and Japan. The Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association firmly supports this great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people with profound historical significance.

The memorandum also points out that the peoples of China and Japan should deepen their understanding, promote friendship, and strengthen unity to fight against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its running dogs. Currently, a small group of Japanese revisionists following the Soviet modern revisionist leadership are colluding with U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries to carry out vicious and blatant anti-China activities. They aim to sabotage the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan. We must distinguish between friends and enemies, unite more closely with those who truly fight for Sino-Japanese friendship and cultural exchanges, and ruthlessly purge the hypocrites from our ranks to ensure the brilliant development of our cause.

The memorandum concludes that the cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan have a broad future. Both sides must further strengthen cooperation, smash all obstacles set up by U.S. imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and Soviet modern revisionists and their various followers, and make the cultural exchanges of 1967 more active. Thus, the cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan will reach a new high.

The signatories to the memorandum are: Ding Xilin and Wang Xiaoyun, representatives of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Nishizono Teruichi and Shi Tu Wu Fu, representatives of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association. Those present at the signing ceremony included Liao Chengzhi, President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, and Otsuka Yuzo, Vice-President of the Osaka Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox).

    《中日两国人民间文化交流备忘录》强调指出
    中国文化大革命为世界革命创立新样板
    帝修反采取各种手段进行无耻的造谣诽谤一定要失败
    新华社十日讯　中国人民对外文化友好协会代表和日本中国文化交流协会代表，今天签署了《中日两国人民间文化交流备忘录》。备忘录热烈赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，为世界革命创立了崭新的样板，从而对世界革命人民的反帝反修斗争，对发展世界革命的进步的文化事业，产生了不可估量的影响，也对中日两国人民间的文化交流开辟了崭新的局面。
    备忘录中写道，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，在毛主席亲自发动和领导下，正在轰轰烈烈地进行一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大破资产阶级的世界观，大立无产阶级的世界观，夺去党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权力，铲除修正主义和资本主义复辟的毒芽，不断取得重大胜利，保证了伟大的中华人民共和国永不变颜色，将社会主义革命进行到底，为世界革命创立了崭新的样板。
    备忘录谴责帝国主义、各国反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者采取各种手段，进行无耻的造谣诽谤，甚至不惜采取法西斯暴力，拚死地反对毛泽东思想，反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，妄图破坏中国无产阶级文化大革命在世界人民和日本人民中的巨大影响。备忘录指出，他们这种违背人类历史潮流，倒行逆施的挣扎，必将失败。中国无产阶级文化大革命，必将取得最后的胜利，并取得世界人民和日本人民越来越大的支持。日本中国文化交流协会坚决支持中国人民的这个具有伟大历史意义的革命斗争。
    备忘录还指出，中日两国人民应进一步加深了解，促进友好，加强团结，对共同敌人美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争。目前，一小撮追随苏联现代修正主义领导集团的日本修正主义分子，正同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派配合，千方百计地进行恶毒露骨的反华活动，破坏中日两国人民友好和中日两国人民文化交流的事业。我们只有分清敌我，更紧密地团结真正为中日友好和文化交流而斗争的人们，无情地从我们的队伍里清洗掉挂羊头卖狗肉的伪君子，才能保证我们的事业获得辉煌的发展。
    备忘录最后写道，中日两国人民间的文化交流有着广阔的前途，双方今后必须进一步紧密合作，粉碎来自美帝国主义、日本反动派，和苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者所设置的一切障碍，把一九六七年的文化交流搞得更活跃，从而把中日两国人民的文化交流推向一个新的高潮。
    在备忘录上签字的是：中国人民对外文化友好协会代表丁西林、王晓云，日本中国文化交流协会代表西园寺公一、白土吾夫。参加签字仪式的，有中日友协会长廖承志，日中友协（正统）大阪府总部副会长大塚有章。（附图片）
