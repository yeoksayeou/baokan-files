The sun rises, and its rays shine into a small wooden house in the suburbs of Tokyo. A Japanese youth, facing the dawn, stands before a portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, concentrating as he holds a carving knife, creating a paper-cut artwork. He wants to express the boundless love of the Japanese people for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep friendship with the 700 million Chinese people through this work.

This young man, named Tanmura, is a poor printer. He deeply respects and loves Chairman Mao. His room is filled with portraits and photographs of Chairman Mao, all carefully cut from Chinese magazines. He often listens to Beijing Radio, especially loving to hear Chairman Mao's words. Beijing Radio often broadcasts this quote from Chairman Mao: "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" Every word in this quote resonates deeply in his heart. He thinks that Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the people of the world. People of all countries should unite around Chairman Mao, following him to strike against the old world.

Last year, he saw a New Year's print in the "Chinese Magazine." In the center of the print is the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, with the various ethnic groups of China marching forward proudly beside him. He has deep feelings for this print. He decided to turn this New Year's print into a paper-cut artwork to express the grand spirit of all the people of the world uniting around Chairman Mao and marching forward with great strides.

Turning this wish into reality was not without difficulties. He only started learning to carve Chinese paper-cuts two years ago, and previously, he only carved small works. This time, he wanted to create a work on a surface over two feet wide and half a foot high, expressing the great image of Chairman Mao and the deep emotions of the masses in the picture, who love Chairman Mao and firmly follow him forward. This was not an easy task. Out of his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, he had only one thought: he must carve this work perfectly. During the day, he had to work, and at night, the light in the room was too dim, so he would get up early every day and sit at a small table by the window, carving in the morning sun.

When it was time to carve the image of Chairman Mao, he repeatedly and meticulously observed the original print and repeatedly and meticulously recalled the great image of Chairman Mao in his mind—Chairman Mao is like the eternal sun, bringing light, warmth, hope, inspiration, and strength to the working people of the world. The next morning, he carved cautiously yet boldly, successfully capturing the great image of Chairman Mao. A friend asked him, "Why can you carve the great image of Chairman Mao so well?" He replied, "Because I love Chairman Mao." Thus, Tanmura, full of passion, from late November last year to January 2nd this year, spent over thirty mornings completing this work, which embodies his boundless admiration, love, and worship for Chairman Mao.

Tanmura has a good friend named Sato, who, like Tanmura, deeply loves Chairman Mao and has deep feelings for the Chinese people. Tanmura's work deeply moved Sato. He decided to write a poem to accompany Tanmura's paper-cut, reflecting the significance of this work and expressing the shared feelings of himself and Tanmura. Soon, a passionate poem praising the great leader Chairman Mao was written:

	In the sky, there is only one red sun,
	It rises from the east,
	Illuminating the world with brilliant rays.
	Chairman Mao's teachings
	Show the people of the world the path and direction to liberation.
	See! His words make the seas surge and the masses sing.
	This song crosses the Great Wall,
	This song crosses the Yangtze River,
	This song echoes on the peaks of the snow-capped mountains.
	Ah! Chairman Mao, billions of people love you,
	It is you who awakened billions of people,
	It is you who gave them new life!
	You are the great savior of billions of people.

On January 28th, Tanmura and Sato came to the office of the Chinese journalists in Tokyo, requesting that the Chinese journalists convey this paper-cut and this poem to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Sato also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, which said: "Our most beloved Chairman Mao: I feel greatly honored to be able to present my poem and my friend Tanmura's paper-cut work to you. In the poem, I truthfully wrote down our love for you. This feeling is not just mine but also the feeling of the revolutionary people of Japan." The letter expresses wishes for the long life of the beloved Chairman Mao!

In the end, Sato shouted in the letter: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China! Long live true Sino-Japanese friendship! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

    献给伟大的领袖毛主席
    两位日本青年用精心创作的剪纸和颂诗表达对毛主席的热爱
    太阳升起，光芒照进东京郊区的一间狭小的木板屋内。一位日本青年，迎着曙光，面对着墙壁上的毛主席画像，全神贯注地手执刻刀，正在创作一幅剪纸作品。他要在这一作品中，刻进日本人民对伟大的领袖毛主席的无比热爱和对七亿中国人民的深厚友情。
    这位名叫谷村的青年，是一位贫苦的印刷工人。他无限崇敬和无限热爱毛主席。在他住的房间内贴满了毛主席的画像和照片，这些都是他从中国画报上精心剪下来的。他经常收听北京电台的广播，最爱听毛主席的话。北京广播电台经常广播毛主席这样一段语录：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”这段语录中的每个字都说到他的心坎上去了。他想，毛主席是中国人民的领袖，也是世界人民的领袖。世界各国人民也要象中国人民一样团结在毛主席的周围，跟着毛主席向旧世界冲击。
    去年，他从《中国画报》上看见一幅年画。画面的正中央是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，左右是跟着毛主席昂首阔步前进的中国各族人民。他对这幅画有着深厚的感情。他决心把这幅年画制成剪纸作品，以表达全世界人民都团结在毛主席的身边大踏步地前进的雄伟气概。
    把这样一个愿望变成现实，不是没有困难的。他两年前才开始学刻中国剪纸，过去都是刻的小型作品，而这次自己要创作的作品，是要在二尺多宽、半尺高的图面上，表现出伟大领袖毛主席的伟大形象以及画面上的群众无限热爱毛主席、坚定地跟着毛主席前进的深刻的表情，这不是一件容易的事情。出于对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，他只有一个想法：一定把这部作品刻成刻好。他白天要上工，晚间室内灯光太暗，因此就每天早起坐在窗前的小桌子旁，迎着朝阳刻了起来。
    当要刻到毛主席的形象的前夕，他又对照原画一遍又一遍地深入细致地观察，一遍又一遍地深入细致地回忆毛主席在自己脑海中形成的伟大形象——毛主席象永恒的太阳，给普天下劳动人民带来了光明、温暖、希望、鼓舞和力量。第二天早晨，他谨慎而又大胆地刻起来，成功地把毛主席的伟大形象刻划出来了。有朋友问他：为什么能把毛主席的伟大形象，刻得那样好？他回答说：“因为我热爱毛主席。”就这样，谷村满怀激情，从去年十一月底到今年一月二日，共用了三十多个清晨，完成了这件凝结了自己对毛主席无限敬仰、无限热爱、无限崇拜心情的作品。
    谷村有一位名叫佐藤的好朋友，他也和谷村一样，非常热爱毛主席，对中国人民有着深厚的感情。谷村的作品，深深感动了佐藤。他决定为谷村的剪纸配上一首诗，以反映出这一作品的意义，并表达他和谷村的共同心情。不久以后，一首热情洋溢的歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的诗写出来了：
    天上只有一个红太阳，
    它从东方升起，
    普照世界，光芒万丈。
    毛主席的教导，
    给普天下的人民指出解放的道路和方向。
    看吧！他的话，使四海翻腾，万众欢唱。
    这歌声跨过万里长城，
    这歌声越过千里长江，
    这歌声回旋在高耸云霄的雪山顶上。
    啊！毛主席，亿万人民热爱您，
    是您，唤起了亿万人民的觉醒，
    是您，使他们获得了新生！
    您是亿万人民的大救星。
    一月二十八日，谷村和佐藤来到中国驻东京记者办公室，请中国记者将这幅剪纸和这首诗，转献给伟大的领袖毛主席。
    佐藤还给毛主席写了一封信，信中说：“我们最敬爱的毛主席：我能把我的诗和我的朋友谷村的剪纸作品献给您，感到无上光荣。在诗中，我如实地写下了我们对您的热爱。这种心情不仅是我个人的，而且是革命的日本人民的心情。”信中表示敬祝敬爱的毛主席万寿无疆！
    佐藤最后在信中高呼：“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“真正的日中友好万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”　（新华社记者）
