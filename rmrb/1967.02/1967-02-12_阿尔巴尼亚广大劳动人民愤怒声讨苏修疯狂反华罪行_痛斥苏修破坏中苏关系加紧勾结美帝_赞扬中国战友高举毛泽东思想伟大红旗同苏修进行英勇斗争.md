The broad masses of the Albanian people are filled with indignation and strongly denounce the Soviet revisionist ruling clique for instigating hooligans to break into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, smash and steal items from the news picture window, and brutally beat Chinese embassy staff and journalists. They firmly support the Chinese comrades in the Soviet Union who are bravely and justly fighting against the Soviet revisionist renegades under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The workers of the "Enver Hoxha" Mechanical Factory expressed their strong indignation and strongly condemned the new crimes of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The deputy chairman of the factory's trade union, T. Nano, said: All the workers in our factory are filled with great anger upon hearing the news of the new crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist authorities against our Chinese brothers. We strongly protest against this inhuman crime by the Soviet revisionists and enthusiastically support the brave struggle of our Chinese comrades. At the same time, we sincerely wish our comrades who were injured in this struggle a speedy recovery.

Worker N. Kovaci said: The new crimes of the Soviet revisionists are as bloody as the suppression of the 69 Chinese students in Europe. This is a new step in their deliberate sabotage of Sino-Soviet relations and their intensified collusion with U.S. imperialism, personally plotted by the Brezhnev and Kosygin renegade clique.

Worker F. Siti said: The new crimes committed by the hooligans, with the help of Soviet police, against the Chinese embassy staff and journalists in the Soviet Union, show that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is terrified of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and is going mad with fear.

Siti said: The Soviet revisionists' mad and shameless opposition to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows that the Chinese people are doing the right thing!

The chairman of the New China Agricultural Cooperative, I. Mare, said: All the members of our cooperative are outraged and strongly protest against the heinous crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist hooligans. We are proud of the brave struggle of our Chinese comrades.

Mare said: The atrocities of the Soviet revisionist authorities will make the Soviet people further recognize the reactionary face of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, which is anti-China and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is fundamentally shaking the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists. The fate of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is the same as that of the handful of power-holders in China who are taking the capitalist road, who will inevitably be overthrown by the revolutionary people.

Young female cooperative member V. Toska said: I, along with all the members of our cooperative, severely condemn the despicable criminal acts of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and enthusiastically support our Chinese comrades. Although the Soviet revisionists are madly anti-China and oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, they will never succeed. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique was traitors in the past and is now even more proven to be traitors.

A student representative from the History and Language Department of the University of Tirana, B. Kapo, said: All 600-plus students in our department, along with all the youth of our country, strongly and resolutely protest against the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionist renegades. The new crime of the Soviet revisionists once again exposes their traitorous face in deliberately sabotaging Sino-Soviet relations. Shame on the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique! Shame on them!! We express our enthusiastic support and solidarity with the brave struggle of our Chinese comrades. Let us shout: Glory to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!

    阿尔巴尼亚广大劳动人民愤怒声讨苏修疯狂反华罪行
    痛斥苏修破坏中苏关系加紧勾结美帝
    赞扬中国战友高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗同苏修进行英勇斗争
    据新华社地拉那十日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大人民怀着万分愤慨的心情，愤怒声讨苏联修正主义统治集团指使暴徒闯进中国驻苏联大使馆，砸坏和抢走新闻图片橱窗、毒打中国大使馆外交人员和中国记者的滔天罪行，并最坚决地支持在苏联的中国战友高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同苏修叛徒进行英勇、正义的斗争。
    “恩维尔·霍查”机械厂全体职工怀着极大的愤怒，强烈谴责苏修统治集团卑鄙无耻的新罪行。这个工厂的工会副主席托·纳诺说：我们工厂的全体职工听到苏修当局对中国兄弟所犯下的新罪行的消息后，个个义愤填膺，怒火万丈。我们最强烈地抗议苏修这一毫无人性的罪行，最热情地支持中国战友们的英勇斗争。同时，我们衷心祝愿在这场斗争中负伤的同志早日恢复健康。
    工人尼·科瓦奇说：苏修的新罪行同血腥镇压六十九名中国留欧学生事件一样，是由勃列日涅夫和柯西金叛徒集团亲自策划的。这是他们蓄意破坏中苏关系、加紧苏美勾结的新步骤。
    工人弗·西蒂说，暴徒们在苏修警察帮助下，对中国驻苏联大使馆的外交人员和中国记者犯下的新罪行，说明苏修统治集团对史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，吓得发疯。
    西蒂说，苏修这样疯狂无耻地反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，说明中国人民做得好！做得对！
    新中国农业社主席易·马赖说，我们农业社全体社员对苏修暴徒犯下的滔天罪行，感到无比愤慨并提出强烈抗议。对中国同志的英勇斗争，我们感到骄傲。
    易·马赖说，苏修当局的暴行促使苏联人民进一步认识苏联修正主义统治集团反华、反毛泽东思想的反动面目。中国无产阶级文化大革命从根本上动摇了苏修的反动统治。等着苏修统治集团的是象中国一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派那样不可避免地被革命人民打倒的命运。
    青年女社员瓦·托斯卡说：我和我们农业社的全体社员一样，严厉谴责苏修统治集团卑鄙的犯罪行为，热烈支持我们的中国战友。苏修虽然疯狂反华、反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，但是，他们是永远不会得逞的。苏修统治集团过去是叛徒，现在更证明他们是叛徒。
    地拉那大学历史语言系的学生代表巴·卡波依说：我们全系六百多名同学同我国全体青年一样，最坚决最强烈地抗议苏修叛徒的法西斯罪行。苏修的这一新罪行再一次暴露了他们蓄意破坏中苏关系的叛徒嘴脸。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团可耻！可耻！！我们对中国战友的英勇斗争表示热情的声援和支持。让我们高呼：光荣属于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想！
