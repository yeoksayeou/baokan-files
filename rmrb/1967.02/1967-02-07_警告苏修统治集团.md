Warning to the Soviet Revisionist Ruling Clique

We are boiling with rage, and our hearts are surging with anger. We firmly support the government's statement and strongly protest against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique!

The "January 25" Red Square anti-China incident was despicable and shameless, a crime of enormous magnitude. The "February 3" new anti-China atrocity is unprecedented in the annals of world diplomacy. The people of the world can see clearly: the power of Mao Zedong Thought is boundless; the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are heroes who stand tall and firm! The people of the world can see clearly: the Soviet revisionists are having a hard time, their fate is miserable; their frenzied arrogance and apparent strength are all signs of their paper tiger weakness. The Chinese people fear neither heaven nor earth, so why should we fear a handful of Soviet revisionist troublemakers? The more the Soviet revisionist ruling clique goes crazy with anti-China sentiment, the more it exposes your traitorous faces! Warning to the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, your doom is near, and death is not far off; the great people of the Soviet Union will one day settle your accounts and rise up against you! The great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable, and we will forever stand together in anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism; the banner of Leninism will once again fly high over the land of the Soviet Union, and we will see Mao Zedong Thought shining brightly across the sky!

    警告苏修统治集团
    解放军某部　余光烈浑身血在涌，胸中怒涛翻，我们最坚决拥护政府声明，我们最强烈抗议苏修统治集团！
  “一·二五”红场反华事件，苏修卑鄙无耻罪恶滔天；
  “二·三”新的反华暴行，更是世界外交史上罕见。全世界人民看得清楚：毛泽东思想威力无边；用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，是顶天立地的英雄汉！全世界人民看得清楚：苏修日子难过，命运悲惨；疯狂嚣张，貌似强大，统统是纸老虎虚弱的表现。中国人民天不怕、地不怕，难道还怕你一小撮苏修捣蛋？苏修统治集团越是疯狂反华，越是暴露你们叛徒的嘴脸！警告苏修统治集团，你们末日临近，离死不远；伟大的苏联人民总有一天要算你们的总帐，起来造你们的反！中苏人民的伟大友谊牢不可破，反帝反修永远携手并肩；列宁主义的旗帜将重新在苏联土地上高高飘扬，喜看毛泽东思想红满天！
