Revolutionary rebels of the proletariat must seize power from those who are taking the capitalist road. We must also seize power from the "self" within our own minds!

Seize what power? Seize the power of the "self" in our minds!

Only by eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in our minds, allowing proletarian thought to occupy the terrain, can we clearly understand for whom we are seizing power and for whom we are holding power. Otherwise, seizing power from those who are taking the capitalist road will be just empty talk!

Individualism is the root of all evil, and selfish thoughts are the root of all troubles!

When the "self" holds power, it will promote personal gain, factionalism, and cliquism. In the face of great unity, it will either not unite, or unite but not harmonize, or split after uniting!

When the "self" holds power, it will show off personal abilities, seek personal fame, and fight for personal power! In the struggle to seize power from those who are taking the capitalist road, it will seize power for "me," hold power for "me" alone, and rule for "me"!

When the "self" holds power, it will be anxious about gains and losses, sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes left, sometimes right, and waver indecisively. Victory will make one lose one's head, and failure will make one panic.

When the "self" holds power, it will have short-sighted vision and be greedy for personal gain, easily falling prey to the enemy's sugar-coated bullets! After seizing power, it will also certainly not be able to consolidate it!

In our minds, the "public" must hold power, and the "self" must step down. Only without selfishness can one be public-spirited, fearless, and forever young in revolution, invincible!

Revolutionary comrades! Let us seize power from the depths of our souls! Use Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all selfish thoughts, seize back all the terrain and power that the "self" has occupied in our minds, and plant the flag of the "public"! This way, we can:

Unite for the revolution: unite firmly like steel!

Seize power for the revolution: seize power without defeat!

Hold power for the revolution: hold power forever!

    向“私”字夺权
    中国人民解放军技术工程学院革命造反团
    无产阶级革命造反派在向走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，也必须在自己的灵魂深处来一场大夺权！
    夺什么权？夺头脑中
  “私”字的权！
    只有在自己的头脑里破私立公，让无产阶级思想占领阵地，才能明确为谁夺权，为谁掌权。否则，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，只能是一句空话！
    个人主义是万恶之源，私心杂念是百病之根！
      “私”字当“权”，就会大搞风头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义。在大联合面前，或者联不起来，或者联而不合，或者联后分裂！
      “私”字当“权”，则处处逞个人之能，出个人之名，争个人之权！在向走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，就会为“我”夺权，唯“我”独尊，为“我”掌权！
      “私”字当“权”，则患得患失，忽冷忽热，时“左”时右，动摇不定。胜利就会冲昏头脑，失败就会吓慌手脚。
      “私”字当“权”，则目光短浅，利欲熏心，就容易为敌人的糖衣炮弹所打中！夺权之后也必然巩固不住！
    在我们的头脑中，“公”字必须当“权”，“私”字必须退“位”。无私才能为公，无私才能无畏，无私才能永葆革命的青春、无往而不胜！
    革命的战友们！让我们来一场灵魂深处的大夺权吧！用毛泽东思想横扫一切私心杂念，把自己头脑里
  “私”字占领的一切阵地、
  “掌”的一切“权”统统夺过来，插上“公”字的大旗！这样，我们就能：
    为革命联合：联合坚如钢！
    为革命夺权：夺权无不胜！
    为革命掌权：大权永不失！
