The Central Military Commission issued a directive on February 23, calling on all military personnel to immediately mobilize and follow the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao on "seizing the revolution and promoting production." The directive urges the military to uphold the glorious tradition of being both a fighting force, a work force, and a production force, actively assisting local rural people's communes and various levels of leaders to ensure a successful spring planting season.

The directive states that the Central Committee's February 20 letter to all rural people's communes, poor and lower-middle peasants, and various levels of cadres is a document of great significance. All military personnel must take immediate action, actively assisting local rural people's communes and various levels of leaders to ensure a successful spring planting season. This is a pressing task with a strict time limit, and all levels of leadership must pay great attention to it and firmly grasp it.

The directive requires local military units to follow the spirit of the Central Committee's letter to all rural people's communes, poor and lower-middle peasants, and various levels of cadres. They should vigorously promote the strategic significance of seizing the revolution and promoting production, not miss the agricultural season, and quickly launch a high tide of spring planting. Provincial military districts, military sub-districts, and municipal and county armed forces departments should prioritize ensuring a successful spring planting season, assisting local (provincial, prefectural, municipal, and county) leadership and rural people's communes in holding spring planting meetings, and specifically arranging for the implementation of spring planting work. In some areas, military sub-districts, municipal and county armed forces departments, and military units at the regiment level and above should also consult with local poor and lower-middle peasant organizations to establish leadership teams for production and assist the masses in arranging spring planting. All levels of armed forces departments should mobilize all militia to become the backbone of spring planting, fully playing the role of militia production shock teams.

The directive requires local military units to seize the opportunity to provide labor and technical support to rural people's communes for spring planting. All units must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought and the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The directive also points out that during the support for spring planting, the military must remain vigilant and, together with local dictatorship organs and poor and lower-middle peasant organizations, firmly strike against any attempts by class enemies to disrupt the rural cultural revolution and production.
