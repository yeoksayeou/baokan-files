The military and civilians on the Fujian front solemnly held a rally to completely smash the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the military and civilians of Fujian smash the counterrevolutionary current.

The class enemy has directed the spearhead of struggle against the great People's Liberation Army, against the revolutionary masses of the old revolutionary base in Fujian, against the revolutionary cadres who adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and against the revolutionary masses. We must not let their plots succeed. The military leader Han Xianchu, the representative of revolutionary cadres Wei Jinshui, and the representative of revolutionary mass organizations resolutely declared that they would continue to strive for new victories.

Fujian Province solemnly held a rally to completely smash the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line in the coastal city of Fuzhou on February 11. The rally declared that the genuine revolutionary forces in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City had smashed a counterrevolutionary current stirred up by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in this fierce class struggle. This victory is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This victory has pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the province to a new stage of great alliance and seizure of power by the revolutionary masses.

On February 11, red flags fluttered over Fuzhou City, and revolutionary songs echoed through the sky. Fully armed soldiers of the Fujian front land, sea, and air forces, along with teams of revolutionaries holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered in the spacious "May 1st Square." The heroic frontline air force sent planes to scatter revolutionary leaflets over the venue, filling the entire scene with a revolutionary fighting atmosphere.

The representative of the Fujian front land, sea, and air forces of the People's Liberation Army, Han Xianchu, and the representative of revolutionary cadres, Wei Jinshui, attended the rally.

At 2:30 PM, the rally began to the majestic tune of "The East Is Red."

Han Xianchu, representing the entire land, sea, and air forces of the Fujian front, spoke at the rally (full text on page 2). He pointed out that this rally is a victory celebration, a rally to lay the foundation for the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and a rally to pledge new victories. He said that the revolutionary masses of Fujian have smashed the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampening the arrogance of the class enemy. Han Xianchu said that in the struggle, we must adhere to the direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao and fight to the end with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the provincial and municipal committees. Han Xianchu finally declared: The land, sea, and air forces of the Fujian front will resolutely carry out the instructions of the supreme commander, Chairman Mao, strengthen preparedness, defend the national defense, defend the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, defend the Cultural Revolution, and steadfastly support and assist the genuine proletarian revolutionary masses. We will share life and death, share destiny, unite, fight, and win together.

Revolutionary cadre representative, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Governor of Fujian Province, Wei Jinshui, spoke next. He said that in this decisive battle between the proletariat and the broad laboring masses and the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party, we must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, achieve the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the old revolutionary base, learning from the People's Liberation Army. Wei Jinshui declared: Revolutionary cadres in party and government organs must contribute their strength in the struggle for power seizure. Seriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production" to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Speakers at the rally also included representatives from the "August 29th" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Fujian Province, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Fujian Workers, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Fujian Peasants, and the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Fujian Government Officials. They unanimously pointed out: At a time when the entire country is engaged in comprehensive class struggle, our great leader Chairman Mao instructs the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses, and at a critical moment when revolutionary mass organizations, local military leaders, and revolutionary cadres implement the "three-in-one" joint seizure of power, at a critical moment when the three armies of the Fujian front strengthen their preparedness, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City created new plots, stirred up evil winds, and launched another mad counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, directly aiming their struggle spearhead at the great People's Liberation Army, at the revolutionary masses with a glorious tradition in the old revolutionary base of Fujian, at the genuine proletarian revolutionary masses, and at the revolutionary cadres who adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This is absolutely not allowed to succeed. "The golden monkey raises a thousand-catty club, and the jade sky clears the dust for ten thousand miles." The revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and frontline soldiers armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought quickly saw through the enemy's new plots. With the support of the frontline troops, the proletarian revolutionary masses rose up to counterattack, repelled the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieved a great victory. The representatives unanimously declared: They would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "it is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu," continue to fight, pursue and attack, completely smash the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary masses.

The rally passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao.

After the rally, a grand demonstration march was held. Fifteen hundred thousand revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participated in the rally and the march. Leading the march were the soldiers of the Fujian front land, sea, and air forces, who are responsible for defending the motherland and the Cultural Revolution. They held up a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, looked magnificent in their military uniforms, and advanced in military vehicles and cars, with revolutionary masses cheering along the way: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!"

Following the People's Liberation Army were the revolutionary leftists who have been fighting bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution— the young revolutionaries of the "August 29th" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters. Next were the rebel teams of the old revolutionary base and other revolutionary rebel organizations. Shouts of "Completely smash the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Do not allow the struggle spearhead to be directed at the Liberation Army, shifting the direction of struggle!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" echoed through the Fujian front.
