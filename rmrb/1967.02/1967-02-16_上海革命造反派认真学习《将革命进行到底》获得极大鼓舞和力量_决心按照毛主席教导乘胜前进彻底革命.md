In the storm of the "January Revolution," the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels and the broad revolutionary masses have achieved tremendous struggle victories. They are now re-studying the brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" by our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They have drawn great inspiration and new fighting strength from Chairman Mao's work, and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, press forward to victory, carry the revolution through to the end, and revolutionize forever!

The Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels, through arduous struggles, have achieved great unity and seized back the various powers that had been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At this moment of great victory, the "Wenhui Daily" and the "Liberation Daily" on February 8 republished Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," which was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary people. They said that now, re-studying Chairman Mao's work, listening to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, is very timely, very intimate, and of great significance.

After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work, the soldiers of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps expressed their determination to continue marching forward on the ten-thousand-li journey. They said, seizing power does not mean the end of the revolution, but rather the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march has been taken. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy to the end than to stop halfway like the emperor of the state of Chu." We proletarian revolutionaries must not only dare to seize power but also dare to consolidate and defend the power we have seized and carry the revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who have been ousted from power and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves. They will inevitably try every means to counterattack. Every proletarian revolutionary must heighten revolutionary vigilance and be prepared at any time to smash all their tricks and conspiracies.

They linked this to their current tasks, saying: At present, for us proletarian revolutionaries, we must also seriously carry out a revolution in our minds to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. If we do not do this, there is the danger of halting the revolution midway. Some people, due to the growth of arrogance and self-satisfaction in their minds, have been burdened by the achievements of past struggles, and thus their steps forward are no longer as light and powerful as before. They lie on their past achievements and sleep soundly. Isn't this very dangerous! We proletarian revolutionaries must seriously and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out a thorough revolution in our minds, eliminate selfish thoughts, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and being good at struggling, and enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. We must unite with the broad revolutionary masses and resolutely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Carry the revolution through to the end."

The revolutionary rebels of the Laogang Commune in Nanhui County broke through numerous obstacles and seized back the power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Afterward, they gathered together to review Chairman Mao's brilliant work. They deeply felt that seizing back the power was only the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march, and the tasks ahead would be even more arduous, with the struggles becoming more complex and sharp. Although the handful of capitalist-roaders within our brigade's Party have been ousted from power by us, they are not reconciled and their reactionary nature has not changed. Recently, they have been active everywhere, holding secret meetings, and trying to win over some uninformed masses to attack us revolutionary rebels, attempting to seize back the power they have lost. This has deeply educated us, making us further realize that the struggle for power and counter-power is a sharp and complex class struggle. We must heighten our vigilance and absolutely cannot, just because we have seized their power, think that the revolution is successful and everything is fine, and can lie down to sleep soundly. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings one hundred percent, carry the revolution through to the end, and absolutely not halt midway, absolutely not pity the snake-like evil people, and absolutely not relax our fighting spirit.

When the soldiers of a certain air force unit stationed in Shanghai studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work, they recalled past struggles and felt particularly moved. They said: At the end of 1948, when the Chinese people were about to achieve final victory in the great war of liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Carry the revolution through to the end." All the soldiers were greatly inspired, their fighting spirit soared, and they resolutely marched to Nanjing to capture Chiang Kai-shek! They crossed the Yangtze River to liberate all of China! The resounding slogan "Carry the revolution through to the end" was not only written on straw hats and printed on towels but was also deeply engraved in the hearts of every soldier and officer, becoming the action guideline for the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. Under the leadership of the Party, through the efforts of the people of the whole country and the bloody struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the Chiang regime was smashed, and the country was liberated! They deeply felt that Chairman Mao's brilliant work has special strategic and practical significance today. They said, at present, our Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the situation is very encouraging. But can we now "relax a bit"? No, we cannot! We must absolutely not relax our fighting will. The class nature of the enemy will not change by a single bit. They will not voluntarily lay down their butcher's knives, nor will they become Buddhas. We must not be deceived by their sweet words and pitiful appearances. We must absolutely not be arrogant, complacent, and careless because of victory.

Many revolutionary rebels pointed out in their studies that with the continuous victories of the Cultural Revolution, more and more people have seen the situation clearly and stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stood under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We proletarian revolutionaries will achieve greater unity and solidarity. At the same time, we must also be vigilant against the enemy using "peaceful" methods and infiltrating the revolutionary ranks to preserve and strengthen their positions. We must combine actual struggles, study and apply "Carry the revolution through to the end"; we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continue to press forward, and with one breath, raise a thousand-catty hammer, beat the fallen dogs to death, and root out all the big and small, open and hidden snakes in the fields of Party, government, economy, and culture, smash them to pieces, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The revolutionary youngsters also seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Carry the revolution through to the end." The revolutionary youngsters of the "Work-Study Integration" Combat Team of the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory deeply felt that after seizing power, some people in our minds also have the idea that the overall situation is settled, thinking that those Party members who have been stripped of power and are capitalist-roaders are just a few dead tigers, nothing to be afraid of. Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Carry the revolution through to the end" has sounded the alarm for us, making us see that class struggle is not easing but becoming sharper and more complex. We must heighten our vigilance. They expressed their determination to further carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Lu Xun's beating of fallen dogs. As long as the enemy has not completely surrendered, we will resolutely fight to the end, resolutely smash the ferocious counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary forces, and firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary power.

    上海革命造反派认真学习《将革命进行到底》获得极大鼓舞和力量
    决心按照毛主席教导乘胜前进彻底革命
    一方面：巩固和保卫已夺到的政权，随时准备粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计
    一方面：大破私心杂念，提高无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性
    新华社上海十五日电　在“一月革命”风暴中取得巨大斗争成就的上海革命造反派和广大革命群众，正在重新学习我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》。他们从毛主席的著作中获得了极大的鼓舞和新的斗争力量，决心按照毛主席的教导，乘胜前进，彻底革命，永远革命！
    上海革命造反派经过艰苦斗争，实现了大联合，夺回了由党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持的各种大权。就在这斗争取得巨大胜利的时刻，《文汇报》和《解放日报》二月八日重新刊载了毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》，得到了革命造反派和广大革命人民的热烈欢呼。他们说，现在重新学习毛主席的这篇著作，聆听伟大领袖毛主席的教导，非常及时，非常亲切，意义十分深远。
    上海汽轮机厂工人革命造反纵队的战士学习了毛主席这篇光辉著作以后，表示一定要在万里征途上继续迈步前进。他们说，夺到政权并不意味着革命的结束，而是万里长征迈开了第一步。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们无产阶级革命派既要敢于夺取政权，更要敢于巩固和保卫已经夺到的政权，将革命进行到底。毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”一小撮被赶下台的党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙也决不会自行退出历史舞台，他们必然地要千方百计进行反夺权。我们每一个无产阶级革命派战士，必须提高革命的警惕性，随时准备粉碎他们的一切阴谋诡计。
    他们联系到自己当前的任务说：在当前，对我们无产阶级革命派来说，还必须认真地在自己的头脑里开展一场破私立公的革命。不这样做，我们就会有“使革命半途而废”的危险。有些人由于头脑里滋长了骄傲自满的情绪，他们背上了过去在斗争中取得成绩的包袱，因此前进的步伐就不再象开始时候那样轻快、有力。他们躺在过去的成绩上睡大觉，这样下去难道不是很危险的吗！我们无产阶级革命派，一定要认真地刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，在自己的头脑里来个彻底革命，大破私心杂念，继续发扬敢于斗争、善于斗争的革命精神，提高无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。我们一定要团结广大革命群众，坚决遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“将革命进行到底”。
    南汇县老港公社港东大队革命造反派冲破了重重阻力，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺回了大权以后，聚集在一起，重温了毛主席这一篇光辉著作。他们体会很深地说，夺回了权，这只是万里长征走完了第一步，今后的任务将更加艰巨，斗争更加复杂、更加尖锐。我们大队党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派虽然被我们赶下了台，但是他们心不死，反动本性不改，最近还到处活动，开黑会，拉拢一些不明真相的群众，攻击我们革命造反派，妄图从我们手里夺回失去了的大权。这就更深刻地教育了我们，使我们进一步明确了夺权与反夺权斗争是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，我们一定要提高警惕，决不能因为夺了他们的权，就认为革命成功，万事大吉，可以垫高枕头睡大觉了。我们一定要百分之百地遵照毛主席的教导，将革命进行到底，决不半途而废，决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人，决不松懈自己的斗志。
    驻上海的空军某部战士在学习毛主席这一篇光辉著作时，回忆起过去的斗争，心情特别激动。他们说：一九四八年底，中国人民将要在伟大的解放战争中获得最后胜利的时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召，全军将士受到莫大鼓舞，斗志高昂，坚决打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！打过长江去，解放全中国！“将革命进行到底”这个响亮的口号，不但写在草帽上，印在毛巾上，而且深深地印在每个指战员的心坎上，成为广大干部和战士的行动纲领。在党的领导下，由于全国人民的努力，经过人民解放军的浴血奋战，蒋家王朝被砸烂了，全国解放了！他们深切地感到毛主席这篇光辉著作在今天有着特别重大的战略意义和现实意义。他们说，当前，我们上海无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大的胜利，是一片振奋人心的大好形势。但是，是不是从此可以“松一口气”了呢？不，不能！我们万万不能稍为松懈自己的战斗意志。敌人的阶级本性是不会改变一分一厘一毫一丝的。他们决不肯自动地放下屠刀，也决不会成佛。我们绝不能被他们的花言巧语和可怜相迷惑住，我们万万不能因为胜利而骄傲，而麻痹大意和掉以轻心。
    许多革命造反派在学习中指出，随着文化大革命的节节胜利，越来越多的人看清了形势，站到毛主席的革命路线上来，站到毛泽东思想伟大红旗下来。我们无产阶级革命派将越加巩固地实现大联合、大团结。同时，我们也必须警惕敌人用“和平”的方法和混入革命阵营的方法来保存和加强他们的阵地。我们一定要结合实际斗争，活学活用《将革命进行到底》；一定要按照毛主席的教导，再接再厉，一鼓作气，奋起千钧棒，痛打落水狗，把盘踞在党、政、财、文各个领域里的大大小小的、公开的和隐蔽的毒蛇统统揪出来，砸个稀巴烂，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    革命小将们也认真地学习了毛主席的《将革命进行到底》。上海玻璃机械厂“工学结合”战斗队的革命小将深有体会地说，夺权之后，在我们一些人的头脑中也存在着大局已定的想法，认为那些被剥夺了权力的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，只是几只死老虎，没有什么了不起。毛主席“将革命进行到底”的伟大教导给我们敲起了警钟，使我们看到目前阶级斗争不是缓和了，而是更加尖锐更加复杂了，我们必须提高自己的警惕性。他们表示，一定要进一步发扬鲁迅打落水狗的革命精神，只要敌人还没有彻底投降，我们就坚决打到底，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动势力的猖狂反扑，牢牢保卫住无产阶级的革命政权。
