The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee's Fourth Emergency Notice

	Use Practical Actions to Respond to Chairman Mao's Great Call for Frugality and Revolution

The emergency notice firmly supports and enthusiastically responds to the urgent appeal for frugality and revolution issued jointly by 16 revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanxi Province. Based on the specific situation in Qingdao, the following eight supplementary regulations are made:

1. The revolutionary rebel organizations in various production units are not allowed to stop production for meetings, parades, or celebrations. When organizing parades, the number of participants should be appropriately controlled. Commercial, catering, and service industries are not allowed to shorten their business hours. Workers must stay at their posts and observe labor discipline. Generally, personnel in various revolutionary organizations should not leave their production posts. If there are too many non-production personnel, they must be immediately reduced.

2. The current transportation tasks are extremely heavy. Starting immediately, all units are generally not allowed to use motorized transportation for parades, meetings, or celebrations. Production vehicles should not be converted into propaganda vehicles. Parading on the streets cannot touch the soul, and from now on, parading on the streets is prohibited, and parading on the streets by car is even more prohibited. Motor vehicles used by various revolutionary rebel organizations should be returned to their original units. In the future, without the approval of the Service Department of this Committee, no organization is allowed to use production and transportation vehicles.

3. Various units have used a large amount of cloth to make armbands, banners, and flags. Currently, various revolutionary rebel organizations are achieving great unity, and if new armbands and flags are made, it will inevitably cause a lot of waste. To save cloth, starting immediately, all units are not allowed to make new armbands, banners, or flags. For newly established larger revolutionary rebel organizations that need to make flags, old flags can be remade; old armbands can be remade into chest or arm badges, or paper cards can be used as identification. Excessive and discarded armbands from various organizations should be collected by county, district, and system-level revolutionary rebel organizations and then handed over to the Service Department of this Committee.

4. The revolutionary rebel organizations in various government agencies, enterprises, and institutions must strictly control the expenditure of Cultural Revolution funds. In the future, self-owned funds, special funds, and extra-budgetary funds are not allowed to be misappropriated. If there is any violation, accounting personnel are not allowed to reimburse the expenses.

5. The leaflets and publications printed and reprinted by various revolutionary rebel organizations must focus on quality, pay attention to propaganda effects, control the number of copies, and avoid duplication. If offset printing can be used, lead printing should not be used; if inferior paper can be used, good paper should not be used; if small paper can be used, large paper should not be used. Some leaflets and publications can be sold for a fee. Big-character posters should be made from waste paper as much as possible. Waste paper should be collected and recycled.

6. In the future, all revolutionary organizations are not allowed to purchase furniture, transportation vehicles, megaphones, mimeograph machines, tape recorders, typewriters, radios, or cameras. If they are indeed needed, revolutionary rebel organizations that are supplied by the city should be allocated by the Service Department of this Committee; other revolutionary rebel organizations at various levels should be allocated within their own units. Various organizations must strengthen the management, protection, and frugal use of all materials they currently possess and are using, and must not privately transfer or damage them. They must be vigilant to prevent bad elements from taking advantage of the situation to embezzle, steal, or destroy state assets. If any such cases are found, they must be punished according to law.

7. All organizations and the broad masses must cherish state assets and must not take, smash, or arbitrarily destroy them. They must not damage buildings. If there are any violations, the responsible parties must be investigated, and appropriate measures must be taken according to the severity of the offense.

8. The above regulations will be supervised and implemented by the revolutionary rebel organizations of the financial, banking, and judicial departments and the broad revolutionary masses.

    紧急通告对山西省十六个革命造反组织联合发出的节约闹革命的紧急倡议表示坚决支持和热烈响应，并根据青岛市的具体情况作出八条补充规定
    新华社济南十七日电　青岛市革命造反委员会二月十一日发出第四号紧急通告，要求全市革命造反者以实际行动响应伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召。紧急通告对山西省十六个革命造反组织联合发出的节约闹革命的紧急倡议表示坚决支持和热烈响应，并且根据青岛市的具体情况作出了八条补充规定：

    三、各单位制做袖章、彩旗、队旗，已经用了大量布匹。当前各革命造反组织正在实现大联合，如果重新做袖章、队旗，势必造成很大浪费。为了节约用布，自即日起，各单位一律不准再制做新袖章、彩旗、队旗。新成立的较大的革命造反组织，需要制做队旗，可以用旧旗改制；可利用旧袖章改做胸章或臂章，或用纸制卡片作身份证明。各组织的多余和废旧袖章，一律收回，由县、区、系统等革命造反组织汇集后，交本委员会服务部。

    六、今后各革命组织，一律不准购买家具、交通工具、扩音器、油印机、录音机、打字机、收音机、照相机等。如确属需要，属市供给的革命造反组织，由本委员会服务部调剂解决；其他各级革命造反组织，分别由本单位内部调剂解决。各组织对现在掌握使用的一切物资，要加强保管，爱护节约使用，不准私自转移和损坏。要提高警惕，防止坏人乘机贪污、盗窃、破坏国家资财。如有发现，要依法惩处。
    七、各组织和广大群众，必须爱护国家资财，不得乱拿，乱砸，随意破坏。不得损坏建筑物。如有违反者，必须追查责任，根据情节轻重加以处理。
