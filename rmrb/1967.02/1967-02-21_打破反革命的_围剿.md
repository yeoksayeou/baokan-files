The revolutionary "counter-encirclement and suppression" and the counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" are a major form of armed struggle between the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and U.S. imperialism and its lackeys today.

U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, in order to extinguish the sparks of armed struggle by the revolutionary people, are gathering batch after batch of counterrevolutionary armed forces to carry out one "encirclement and suppression" after another against the revolutionary armed forces. They vainly hope to sever the guerrilla forces from the masses of the people, making them isolated and helpless, and then annihilate them.

However, as Chairman Mao has said, "The ultimate power of war lies in the masses." Revolutionary guerrilla fighters come from the people and rely on the people. They have an inseparable bond with the masses of the people, like fish in water. Therefore, they are invincible.

In the armed struggle of all oppressed peoples against imperialism and its lackeys, there is a history of resisting counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression." Counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" not only fails to destroy the revolutionary forces but also makes the revolutionary people more tempered, stronger, and more numerous in the struggle. It is in the midst of the enemy's gunfire that they forge an iron will; it is from the counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" that they fight their way through.

Chairman Mao said: "The counterrevolution cannot break us, but we will break the counterrevolution." From breaking the counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" to encircling and suppressing the counterrevolution, this is the inevitable law of the development of revolutionary armed struggle.

    打破反革命的“围剿”
    革命的反“围剿”和反革命的“围剿”，是今天亚非拉被压迫人民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行武装斗争的一个主要形式。
    美帝国主义及其走狗，为了扑灭革命人民武装斗争的星星之火，正在纠集一批又一批的反革命武装力量，对革命的武装力量进行一次又一次的“围剿”。他们妄想割断游击队同人民群众的联系，使之陷于孤立无援的境地，然后聚而歼之。
    但是，正如毛主席所说的，“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”革命的游击战士，来自人民，依靠人民。他们同人民群众有着鱼水一样不可分割的密切联系。因而，他们是不可战胜的。
    一切被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，都有一部反对反革命“围剿”的历史。反革命的“围剿”，不但消灭不了革命的力量，反而会使革命人民在战斗中锻炼得更加坚强，更加壮大。正是在敌人的枪林弹雨之中，他们锻炼出一副钢筋铁骨来；正是从反革命的“围剿”中，他们杀出一条血路来。
    毛主席说：“反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”革命人民从打破反革命的“围剿”到围剿反革命，这是革命的武装斗争发展的必然规律。
