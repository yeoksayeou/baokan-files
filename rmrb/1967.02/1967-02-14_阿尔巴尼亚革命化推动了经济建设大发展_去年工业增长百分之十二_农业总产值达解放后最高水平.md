Albania's revolutionization has driven economic construction to great development. Last year, industrial growth reached 12 percent, and agricultural output reached its highest level since liberation.

According to a report from the Albanian State Statistical Bureau, 1966—the first year of Albania's fourth five-year plan—was the year with the best completion of national plans. The report points out, "These achievements prove the unbreakable unity of our people with the Party, the correctness of the leadership and line of the Albanian Labor Party and its Central Committee headed by Enver Hoxha, and the political consciousness and selfless labor spirit of our working people."

The report states that in 1966, the total industrial output plan was completed at 104 percent, an increase of 12 percent compared to 1965. Specifically, petroleum increased by 9 percent, coal by 17 percent, copper by 56 percent, nickel iron by 43 percent, electricity by 24 percent, and machinery by 40 percent.

The report notes that in 1966, the broad masses of workers responded to the Party and government's call for revolutionization, proposing many rationalization suggestions, solving many complex production and technical problems, and building and expanding several new factories and workshops.

The report says that in 1966, the total agricultural output reached its highest level since liberation. According to available materials, the production plans for grains, potatoes, sunflowers, cotton, sugar beets, and tobacco have all been completed. The area sown with grains increased by 7 percent, and the area sown with potatoes increased by nearly three times. A total of 18,600 hectares of wasteland were newly reclaimed.

The report states that the total procurement plan for agricultural products has been completed, with grains, potatoes, cotton, and fruits all exceeding the procurement plan.

The report says that in recent months, a large number of farmers from hilly and mountainous areas have responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, embarking on the path of cooperation. By January 26, out of 500 previously non-cooperative villages, 460 have voluntarily established agricultural cooperatives. The report states that in 1966, the construction plan of enterprises under the Ministry of Construction was completed at 105 percent. Major projects such as the first phase of the Mao Zedong Textile Combine, the Elbasan Steel Rolling Mill, the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory, the Bistrica No. 2 Hydroelectric Station, and the Tirana Cultural Palace were completed.

The Albanian people are opening mountains and building terraces, using every possible means to expand the area of cultivated land and increase grain production.
