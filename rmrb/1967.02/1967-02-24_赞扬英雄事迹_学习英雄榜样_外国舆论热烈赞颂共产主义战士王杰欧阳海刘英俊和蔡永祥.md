Under the nurturing of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, our country has produced heroes like Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang, who shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The heroic deeds of these good soldiers of Chairman Mao are not only examples for our people to learn from, but also receive praise from international public opinion.

A Mirror for Raising Proletarian Consciousness

After the publication of "Wang Jie's Diary," it was immediately translated into various languages abroad, with some newspapers serializing it and others publishing it as separate editions, all of which were welcomed by readers in various countries.

The Albanian People's Army newspaper "Warrior" published excerpts from Wang Jie's diary under the headline "Devoted to the Revolution" for several consecutive days. It also published a photo of Wang Jie and an editorial note. The editorial note stated: "Wang Jie's diary is a mirror for deeply studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to raise proletarian consciousness; in this brilliant material, one can see how he dedicated his entire life to the cause of serving the people."

In November of last year, the Vietnamese Youth Publishing House translated and published the Vietnamese version of "Wang Jie's Diary," printing and distributing over 13,000 copies in one run. In the preface to the publication, the Vietnamese Youth Publishing House detailed the heroic deeds of Wang Jie, Chairman Mao's good soldier, and enthusiastically praised Wang Jie as a fearless, selfless communist warrior dedicated to the people and the revolution. He is a shining example for Vietnamese youth. After the publication of the Vietnamese version of "Wang Jie's Diary," activities to learn from Wang Jie were launched in the Vietnamese people's army units, factories, and rural youth organizations.

Last year, Japan published two versions of "Wang Jie's Diary." First, the "Youth Publishing House" in Tokyo translated and published the Japanese version, followed by "Kawade Shobo Shinsha" also publishing the book.

The translator of "Wang Jie's Diary" published by "Kawade Shobo Shinsha," Iwasa Tamio, wrote in the afterword: "Wang Jie dedicated his youth to the revolution, and every day of his struggle was linked with Mao Zedong Thought. Imperialist countries hope that China will produce modern revisionism in the second and third generations, but as shown in 'Wang Jie's Diary,' as long as Mao Zedong Thought remains in an unshakable position, such a thing will never happen." The translator of "Wang Jie's Diary" published by "Youth Publishing House," Ito Keiichi, said: "Although we and Wang Jie are in different places and fight in different ways, our enemies are the same. Wang Jie's heart is closely connected with ours, very intimate. Although we feel we are not as good as Wang Jie, we should learn from him with deep respect."

Better Understanding the Significance of the Cultural Revolution

In November of last year, second-year Chinese language students at Tokyo's Asia-Africa Language Institute performed a play in Chinese about Chairman Mao's good soldier, Ouyang Hai. The play was adapted from Chapter 7, "Homecoming," of the Chinese novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai."

The students who led the adaptation and performance of the play said that performing "The Song of Ouyang Hai" was to better understand the significance of China's great proletarian cultural revolution and also to promote friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

The tragic experiences of Ouyang Hai's family in old Chinese society and Ouyang Hai's growth under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought deeply moved the actors.

Warm Praise for Chairman Mao's Good Soldier

In August of last year, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article titled "Liu Yingjun Selflessly Defends the People," warmly praising Chairman Mao's good soldier, Liu Yingjun, and published his photo. The article said, "Liu Yingjun consciously and diligently studies Chairman Mao's works, applies Mao Zedong Thought to daily life, and sets an example of proletarian worldview."

The article praised Liu Yingjun's lofty proletarian internationalism and his deep fighting friendship with the Vietnamese people. The article said: "Liu Yingjun, boiling with revolutionary blood, often cares for and supports the Vietnamese people who are on the front line against American imperialism."

Singing Praises for the Good Son of the Chinese People

In December of last year, the Albanian People's Army newspaper "Warrior" published an editorial praising Cai Yongxiang, the communist warrior who sacrificed himself to save the Red Guards' special train, and published his photo.

The article said: "Only those nurtured by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can accomplish such brave and fearless deeds of loyalty to the class, to the people, and to the motherland."

In November of last year, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" also published a dispatch titled "The Brave Example of Cai Yongxiang, a Soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," praising Cai Yongxiang as "a hero in the style of Ouyang Hai, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and a good son of the Chinese people." The dispatch said: "One Cai Yongxiang sacrificed himself, and thousands and tens of thousands of heroes in the style of Cai Yongxiang will emerge."

The era of Mao Zedong is an era of heroes. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, our country has produced heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang... who shine with the brilliance of communism. Their moving deeds not only spread throughout China but also throughout the world. Revolutionary people of all countries enthusiastically praise these good soldiers of Chairman Mao, hailing them as shining examples not only for the Chinese people but also for the revolutionary people of the world.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us to establish a communist worldview and become "a person of noble character, a person of purity, a person of morality, a person free from lowly interests, a person beneficial to the people." Heroes like Lei Feng have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, broken with selfishness, and established public-mindedness, making themselves into people with communist spirit, into new people of the Mao Zedong era. Only the great Mao Zedong Thought can nurture such great warriors with extraordinarily far-reaching revolutionary ideals and extraordinarily lofty revolutionary spirits. People of all countries see from them the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought in transforming people's souls.

To destroy the old world and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without an exploitative system, this is the common ideal of the revolutionary people of the world. To accomplish such a great and arduous historical mission, we need countless revolutionaries who do not seek fame or wealth, who are not afraid of hardship or death, to fight relentlessly and unyieldingly. The revolutionary people of all countries are eager to learn from heroes like Lei Feng and Wang Jie because the noble qualities of these heroes, who dedicate themselves to the revolution and to the people, are what all revolutionaries should possess.

    赞扬英雄事迹　学习英雄榜样
    外国舆论热烈赞颂共产主义战士王杰欧阳海刘英俊和蔡永祥
    本报讯　在伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的哺育下，在我国涌现出象王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊和蔡永祥等闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄人物。这些毛主席的好战士的英雄事迹，不仅是我国人民学习的榜样，而且也受到国外公众舆论的称颂。
    提高无产阶级觉悟的一面镜子
    在《王杰日记》发表以后，立即被国外翻译成各国文字，有的在报刊上连续刊载，有的印成单行本，受到各国读者的欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军机关报《战士报》连续好几天在《一心为革命》的大字标题下，发表了王杰同志的日记片断。同时刊登了王杰同志的一幅生前照片和编者按语。编者按语指出：“王杰的日记是深入学习和运用毛泽东思想以提高无产阶级觉悟的一面镜子；在这部闪耀着光辉的材料中，可以看到他是如何把自己的整个生命贡献给了为人民服务的事业。”
    去年十一月，越南青年出版社翻译出版了越文版的《王杰日记》，一次印刷发行了一万三千多册。越南青年出版社在出版说明文章中，详细介绍了毛主席的好战士王杰的英雄事迹，并且热烈赞扬王杰是不怕苦、不怕死，一心一意为人民、为革命的共产主义战士。他是越南青年的光辉榜样。越文版《王杰日记》发行以后，在越南人民军部队和工厂、农村的劳动青年团组织中，都开展了学习王杰的活动。
    去年，日本先后出版了两种版本的《王杰日记》。先是东京的日本“青年出版社”翻译出版了日译本，接着“河出书房”也出版了这本书。
    “河出书房”出版的《王杰日记》的译者岩佐民健在译后记中写道：王杰“把青春献给革命而战斗的每一天，都是和毛泽东思想联结在一起的。帝国主义国家期望中国在第二代、第三代出现现代修正主义，但是正象《王杰日记》所表明的那样，只要毛泽东思想永远占据不可动摇的地位，那种事情是绝不会发生的。”“青年出版社”出版的《王杰日记》的译者伊藤敬一说：“我们和王杰虽然是在不同的地方，用不同方式进行着斗争，但我们的敌人是共同的。……王杰的心和我们的心紧密地联结一起，非常亲近。我们虽然感到不及王杰，但是应当怀着深深的敬意向他学习。”
    更好地理解文化大革命的意义
    日本东京亚非语学院二年级中文系学生在去年十一月间，用中国话演出描写毛主席的好战士欧阳海的话剧。这个话剧是根据中国长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》第七章《家乡行》改编的。
    领导改编、演出这个话剧的学生说，演出《欧阳海之歌》是为了更好地理解中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的意义，同时也是为了增进日中两国人民的友谊。
    欧阳海全家在中国旧社会的痛苦遭遇和欧阳海在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的过程，使演员们深受感动。
    热情赞扬毛主席的好战士
    越南《人民报》在去年八月间发表题为《刘英俊忘我保卫人民》的文章，热烈赞扬毛主席的好战士刘英俊，并刊登了他的照片。文章说，“刘英俊自觉地勤奋地学习毛主席著作，把毛主席思想应用到日常生活中去，树立了无产阶级世界观。”
    文章赞扬刘英俊的崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神和他对越南人民的深厚的战斗友谊。文章说：“沸腾着革命热血的刘英俊，经常关怀着和支持着站在反对美帝国主义的第一线上的越南人民。”
    歌颂中国人民的好儿子
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军机关报《战士报》在去年十二月间发表编辑部文章，热烈赞扬舍身抢救红卫兵专车、一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥，并刊登了他的照片。
    文章说：“只有用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想培养出来的人，才能完成这样忠于本阶级、忠于人民和祖国这样勇敢和大无畏的业绩。”
    越南《人民报》在去年十一月间也发表题为《中国人民解放军战士蔡永祥的勇敢的榜样》的通讯，歌颂蔡永祥是“欧阳海式的英雄，是毛主席的好战士，是中国人民的好儿子。”通讯说：“一个蔡永祥牺牲了，将会出现千万个蔡永祥式的英雄。”
    毛泽东时代是英雄辈出的时代。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我国涌现了象雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥……这样闪耀着共产主义光辉的不朽的英雄。他们的可歌可泣的事迹，不仅传遍了全中国，而且传遍了全世界。各国革命人民热情地赞扬这些毛主席的好战士，称颂他们不仅是中国人民也是世界革命人民的光辉榜样。
    毛主席一再教导我们，要树立起共产主义的世界观，做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”雷锋等英雄人物，正是遵照毛主席的教导，破私立公，使自己成为具有共产主义精神的人，成为毛泽东时代的一代新人。也只有伟大的毛泽东思想才能造就出这样具有无比远大的革命理想和无比崇高的革命精神的伟大战士。各国人民从他们的身上，看到了毛泽东思想改造人们灵魂的巨大威力。
    破坏旧世界，建设一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，这是全世界革命人民的共同理想。完成这样一个伟大而艰巨的历史使命，需要千千万万不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死的革命战士，前赴后继地进行艰苦卓绝的斗争。各国革命人民所以热心地要向雷锋、王杰等英雄人物学习，正是因为这些英雄人物一心为革命，一心为人民的高贵品德，是一切革命者所应当具备的。
