Chinese workers at the Soviet Embassy in Beijing went on strike for three days starting January 27 to protest the fascist atrocity committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Chinese students in Moscow's Red Square. On January 30, upon learning that Soviet diplomatic personnel at the Soviet Embassy in Iraq had brutally beaten Chinese students in Iraq, the workers were filled with indignation and unanimously decided to extend the strike for another three days to express their strongest protest. On the morning of February 2, all Chinese workers went to the Soviet Embassy to resume work. However, the Soviet representative arbitrarily refused their request to return to work and even threatened to dismiss them. The workers immediately pointed out that the Soviet Embassy's actions were in disregard of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and labor protection regulations, amounting to political retaliation, which they firmly reject.

    新华社二日讯　在苏联驻华大使馆工作的全体中国职工，为抗议苏联修正主义领导集团在莫斯科红场上殴打我留欧学生的法西斯暴行，于一月二十七日宣布罢工三天。一月三十日，当中国职工获悉苏联驻伊拉克大使馆外交官员野蛮殴打我留伊学生后，万分愤慨，一致决议继续罢工三天，以示最强烈的抗议。二月二日上午九时，我全体中国职工前往苏联大使馆复工，不料大使馆的代表竟然无理拒绝他们复工，并声言要开除他们。我职工当即指出，苏联驻华大使馆的这种作法是无视中华人民共和国宪法和劳保条例的行为，是政治报复，断然不能接受。
