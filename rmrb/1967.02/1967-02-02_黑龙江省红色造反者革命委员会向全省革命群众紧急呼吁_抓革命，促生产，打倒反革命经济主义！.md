The Black Dragon River Province Red Rebels Revolutionary Committee, which was established at the Black Dragon River Province Red Rebels Great Unity and Seizure of Power Rally on January 31, has issued an urgent appeal to all Red Rebels and revolutionary workers, peasants, and commercial staff in the province to grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolutionary and productive endeavors. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

	Comrades in the Red Rebel ranks across the province, revolutionary comrades:

	Currently, an unprecedented great revolutionary storm of the proletarian revolutionary rebels is sweeping across the entire country with the force of a landslide and the power of thunder, shaking the world.

	The days of all the capitalist-roaders in power are over!

	The death knell of all ghosts and monsters has sounded!

	The millions of Red Rebels in our Black Dragon River Province, holding high the banner of "Rebellion is Just," have, after dozens of days of arduous struggle, achieved decisive victories in the struggle for power.

	Now, we can proudly and openly declare to those capitalist-roaders in power and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line: All power belongs to the Red Rebels! You, step aside!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat; they will struggle to the last." Many facts have proven that these reactionaries are unwilling to accept their own defeat. From the day they were exposed by us Red Rebels, they have been constantly plotting, shooting from the shadows, and setting fires. Especially in recent days, they have been spreading a black wind of economism, attempting to divert a serious political struggle onto the path of economism, thereby undermining the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, disrupting industrial and agricultural production, and market supply. In industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments, they incite workers to demand higher wages and better treatment, misleading some deceived workers to leave their production and work posts, plotting to halt production and transportation, causing the entire national economy to become paralyzed and dysfunctional. In agricultural production, they cater to the backward ideas of a minority of the masses, awarding more work points, issuing random subsidies, privately dividing collective accumulations and reserve grains, selling production tools and draft animals, undermining the foundations of socialism, and destroying collective ownership. In financial and commercial departments, they obstruct the circulation of goods, privately divide goods, arbitrarily use state treasury funds, and unilaterally change tax laws, attempting to create chaos in the market and financial system, and disrupt the normal order of people's lives.

	To these despicable tricks and plots of the enemy, can we Red Rebels allow them to succeed? No! No!! No!!! Here, we declare to these audacious, heinous reactionaries: Cease your evil winds! Withdraw your black hands!

	We Red Rebels are heroes who stand tall and firm: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." Our proletarian revolutionary faction is omnipotent! Our magical powers are boundless! This omnipotence, this magic, is none other than the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we are invincible in all battles. No matter what tricks the enemy plays, they will all fail in front of us.

	However, we broad masses of Red Rebels must also see that the enemy has not been completely defeated. Some capitalist-roaders in power and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are still resisting and playing tricks, shooting from the shadows. Some deceived masses have not yet fully awakened and are still lost. Therefore, we appeal:

	Revolutionary comrades! Unite closely! Open fire on the black wind of economism and do not fall for the economism trap. What we pursue is a red socialist land, not a cup of wine or a few yuan today. If we pursue a cup of wine today and a few yuan tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow we may pay the price of losing our heads and losing the entire socialist land!

	Revolutionary worker comrades! Act immediately! Return to your production posts right away and resolutely, thoroughly, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp the revolution, promote production." Our province is a newly developed industrial region and an important base for national machinery, timber, and coal production. The completion of our province's industrial production plan is directly related to the development of the national economy. Recently, due to the sabotage and disruption by a handful of reactionaries, production has suffered significant losses. We Red Rebels can no longer allow these reactionaries to run amok. We must bravely shoulder the responsibility of "grasping the revolution, promoting production." "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" Even if the sky falls, we can hold it up! Even if the earth sinks, we can fill it in! We can overcome all difficulties and challenges. Let all machines roar! Let all vehicles run smoothly!

	Revolutionary commune members and rural cadres! Act immediately! Commune members and cadres who have gone out for linkage, and urban youth who have gone down to the countryside, quickly return home and carry out the revolution locally, thoroughly exposing the enemy's plots to sabotage agricultural production, and striving to do a good job in agricultural production. Right now, the busy season for preparing for spring plowing is about to arrive, and all agricultural work needs to be started immediately. "So many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Agricultural production has strong seasonality and timeliness, and not a moment can be delayed. We poor and lower-middle peasants Red Rebels understand the value of time best. "Time is grain." A handful of reactionaries are using various means to sabotage the preparation and spring plowing production, we must timely expose this trick, and make this year's agricultural production better than any other year, let a revolutionary "Northern Granary," a brand-new socialist new countryside stand in the northernmost part of the motherland during the Cultural Revolution.

	Revolutionary financial and commercial staff! Act immediately! Thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The financial and commercial front is an extremely important front in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Class enemies want to promote economism and material incentives, all of which will be carried out through this channel. Thoroughly smashing reactionary economism, financial and commercial staff bear a particularly important responsibility. Therefore, all commercial staff must ensure the supply of people's daily necessities, do a good job in the adjustment, sale, and storage of goods, and ensure the normal distribution and circulation of goods. All financial accounting and cashier staff must act according to the party's financial policies, actively fight against various negative phenomena and disciplinary violations. Tax and banking Red Rebels must resolutely safeguard the state's legal tax revenues, severely crack down on speculators, and strictly supervise the use and expenditure of all funds to ensure market prosperity and financial stability.

	All revolutionary comrades, let us join hands under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp the revolution, promote production"!

	The thousand-year history will be rewritten by us Red Rebels; the million-year plan will be arranged by us Red Rebels.

	"Ask the vast land, who controls the rise and fall?" It is us, naturally us. Let those reactionaries who attempt to sabotage the revolution and production tremble before our magnificent achievements!

	Down with economism!

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会向全省革命群众紧急呼吁
    抓革命，促生产，打倒反革命经济主义！
    新华社哈尔滨一日电　在三十一日黑龙江省红色造反者大联合大夺权誓师大会上宣布成立的黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会，向全省红色造反者和革命工人、农民和商业工作者发出抓革命促生产夺取革命生产双胜利的《呼吁书》。《呼吁书》全文如下：全省红色造反者战友们，革命的同志们：
    当前，一场史无前例的无产阶级革命造反派的大联合、大夺权的伟大革命风暴，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，席卷全中国，震撼全世界。
    一切走资本主义道路当权派老爷们的末日来临了！
    一切牛鬼神蛇的丧钟敲响了！
    我们黑龙江省的千百万红色造反者，高举“造反有理”大旗，经过几十天的艰苦奋斗，已经取得了夺权斗争的决定性的胜利。
    现在，我们可以爽爽快快，大大方方地向那些走资本主义道路当权派老爷们和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子们高声宣告：一切权力归红色造反者，你们滚开！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”许多事实也证明了这些反动派是不甘心于他们自己的失败的。从他们被我们红色造反者揪出来那天起，就不断地耍阴谋，放暗箭，点邪火。尤其是最近这些天来，他们又大刮经济主义黑风，企图把一场严重的政治斗争引到经济主义的邪路上去，以此来破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏工农业生产和市场供应。在工矿企业和交通运输部门中，挑动工人闹工资，闹待遇，煽动一些受蒙蔽的职工离开生产岗位和工作岗位，阴谋停工停产，中断交通运输，使整个国民经济瘫痪失灵。在农业生产中，他们迎合少数群众的落后思想，多记工分，乱发补助，私分公共积累和储备粮，变卖生产工具和耕畜，挖社会主义墙脚，破坏集体所有制。在财贸部门，他们阻止商品流通，私分商品，随意动用国库资金，私自更改税法等等，企图造成市场和财政金融的混乱，破坏人民的正常生活秩序。
    对于敌人的这些卑鄙伎俩和阴谋，我们红色造反者能让它得逞吗？不能！不能！！不能！！！在这里，我们要向这些胆大包天，十恶不赦的反动分子，大喝一声：收起你们的妖风！放下你们的黑手！
    我们红色造反者，是顶天立地的英雄好汉：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们无产阶级革命派神通广大得很！我们的法力无边得很！这神通，这法力不是别的，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，我们就攻无不克，战无不胜，不管敌人耍出什么样的阴谋诡计，都得在我们面前彻底破产。
    但是，我们广大红色造反者也不能不看到，敌人还没有彻底被我们打倒，一些走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，还在负隅顽抗，继续玩弄花招，放暗箭；一些受蒙蔽的群众还没有全部觉醒过来，仍在迷途之中。为此，我们呼吁：
    革命的同志们！紧密地团结起来！向经济主义黑风猛烈开火，千万不要上经济主义的大当。我们所追求的是一个红彤彤的社会主义江山，而不是眼前的一杯酒，几元钱。如果我们今天追求一杯酒，明天贪图几元钱，那么后天我们就可能付出人头落地的代价，失去整个社会主义江山！
    革命的工人同志们！紧急行动起来，立刻回到生产岗位上去，坚决地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席向我们提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。我省是一个新兴的工业地区，是国家的重要机械、木材、煤炭生产基地。我省工业生产计划完成得好坏，直接关系到全国经济发展。近来，由于一小撮反动分子的破坏和捣乱，已使生产受到了很大损失。我们红色造反者再不能让这些反动分子胡作非为了，要勇敢地挑起“抓革命，促生产”的重担。“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”天塌下来，我们能顶住！地陷下去，我们能填平！一切难关我们都能闯过，一切困难我们都能克服，让所有的马达都响起来吧！让所有的车辆都畅通无阻吧！
    革命的农村公社社员和农村干部同志们！紧急行动起来！外出串连的社员、干部和进城的下乡知识青年，赶快打回老家去，就地闹革命，彻底揭露敌人破坏农业生产的阴谋诡计，努力搞好农业生产。眼下，正是备耕、春耕大忙季节即将到来之际，各项农活急需立刻着手。“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”农业生产的季节性、时间性很强，一时一刻也不能延误。我们贫下中农红色造反者最懂得时间的宝贵。“时间就是粮食”。一小撮反动分子，正采取各种手段，破坏备耕、春耕生产的进行，我们要及时识破这一诡计，把今年的农业生产搞得比以往任何一年都好，让一个革命的“北大仓”，一个崭新的社会主义新农村，在文化大革命中屹立在祖国的最北方。
    革命的财贸职工们！紧急行动起来！彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。财贸战线是无产阶级文化大革命的一条极为重要的战线，阶级敌人要搞经济主义，物质刺激，都要通过这条渠道。彻底粉碎反动的经济主义，财贸职工承担着特别重要的担子。因此，一切商业工作人员都要保证人民生活必需品的供应，做好商品调、销、存工作，搞好商品的正常分配和正常流通。所有财政会计人员和出纳人员都要按照党的财经政策办事，积极向各种不良现象和违反纪律的行为进行斗争。税务和银行的红色造反者，要坚决维护国家的合法税收，狠狠打击投机倒把分子，严格监督各项资金的使用和支出，以保证市场的繁荣，金融的稳定。
    一切革命同志们，让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，紧密地携起手来，为坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针而奋斗吧！
    千年青史，由我们红色造反者重写；万年大计，由我们红色造反者安排。
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们，自然是我们。让那些企图破坏革命，破坏生产的反动分子，在我们红色造反者的赫赫战果面前发抖吧！
    打倒经济主义！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
                    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会
                            一九六七年一月三十一日
