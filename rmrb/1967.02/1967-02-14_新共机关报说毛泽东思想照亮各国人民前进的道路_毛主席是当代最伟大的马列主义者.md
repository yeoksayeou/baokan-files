	New Zealand Communist Party organ _People's Voice_ weekly, in its January 25 issue, carried an article which warmly praised Chairman Mao as "the most outstanding revolutionary leader and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our times," and said that "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism." The article pointed out that in the 42 years since Lenin's death, it has been Mao Zedong Thought that has been the beacon of Marxism. It is precisely because Mao Zedong has defended and developed Marxism that he has illuminated the path forward for the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world under new circumstances.

	"The historical facts show that Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary leader both in theory and in practice."

	The article said: "All the peoples of the world who are opposed to imperialism, who strive for national liberation, the end of capitalism and the development of socialism, need a clear guide to point out the correct path to the realization of these goals," and "Mao Zedong's teachings are the correct guide for the workers and oppressed peoples of today to follow."

	The article said: Chairman Mao has not only led the struggle to defend Marxism-Leninism and the struggle to expose Soviet modern revisionism, but has also further developed Marxist-Leninist theory. The article pointed out that Chairman Mao "has made new judgments based on the new situation of today and creatively enriched Marxist-Leninist theory."

	The article stressed: "Together with the achievements Mao Zedong has won in leading the Chinese revolution in theory and practice, this has firmly established him not only as the leader of the Chinese people but also as the leader of the workers and oppressed peoples of all countries."

    新共机关报说毛泽东思想照亮各国人民前进的道路
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马列主义者
    新华社讯　新西兰共产党机关报《人民之声》周报，在一月二十五日的一期上发表文章，热烈赞扬毛主席是“我们时代最杰出的革命领袖、最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，“毛泽东思想是最高水平的马克思列宁主义”。文章指出，在列宁逝世后这整个四十二年期间，正是毛泽东思想一直是马克思主义的明灯。正是由于毛泽东捍卫和发展了马克思主义，才在新的情况下照亮了中国人民和世界各国人民前进的道路。
      “历史表明，毛泽东无论在理论上，还是在实际行动上，都是一个伟大的革命领袖。”
    文章说：“一切国家凡是反对帝国主义，谋求民族解放、结束资本主义和发展社会主义的人民，都需要一个明确的指南，指出实现这些目标的正确道路”，而“毛泽东的学说就是今天工人和被压迫人民所应遵循的正确道路的指针”。
    文章说：毛主席不仅领导了捍卫马克思列宁主义的斗争，领导了揭露苏联现代修正主义的斗争，而且还进一步发展了马克思列宁主义理论。文章指出，毛主席“根据当代的新情况提出了新的论断，创造性地丰富了马克思列宁主义理论”。
    文章强调：“这一点，再加上毛泽东在理论上和实践上领导中国革命的过程中所取得的成就，牢牢地确立了他不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且也是各国工人和被压迫人民的领袖。”
