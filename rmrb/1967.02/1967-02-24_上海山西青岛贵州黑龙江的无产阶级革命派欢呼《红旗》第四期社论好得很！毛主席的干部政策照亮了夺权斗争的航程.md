Revolutionary masses in Shanghai, Shanxi, Qingdao, Guizhou, and Heilongjiang hail the editorial in the fourth issue of Red Flag!

Chairman Mao's policy on cadres illuminates the path of the struggle for power

Revolutionary masses resolutely express their determination to correctly identify cadres using class analysis and truly implement the "three-in-one combination"

Revolutionary cadres enthusiastically express their determination to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and strive to achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 23rd, after the editorial "We Must Correctly Handle Cadres" from the fourth issue of 1967 of Red Flag magazine reached Shanghai, Shanxi, Qingdao, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and other provinces and cities, which have already achieved great victories in seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the broad masses of the revolutionary proletariat were all jubilant and enthusiastically hailed it. They immediately began studying and discussing it. They said, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao always points out the most correct direction for us at crucial moments in the revolutionary struggle. This editorial fully and correctly reflects Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. We will resolutely and unconditionally implement it, ensuring the victory of the great historical task of seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road by achieving the great unity of the revolutionary proletariat. Revolutionary masses in Shanghai said:

The editorial fully reflects Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and is our guide for the struggle for power. We will implement it unconditionally!

Revolutionary masses in Shanghai said, this editorial speaks the heart of the revolutionary proletariat! It fully reflects Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and is our guide in the struggle for power. We must study it seriously and implement it resolutely and unconditionally!

The great practice of the "January Revolution" has proven that in places and units where power needs to be seized, a temporary power organ of the "three-in-one combination" must be established. Only in this way can power truly be seized and truly be held. Comrades from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, after studying the editorial of Red Flag, reviewed the practice of the struggle for power and said with deep feeling: Establishing a temporary power organ of the "three-in-one combination" is currently crucial for correctly handling the issue of revolutionary cadres. In dealing with cadres, we must conduct class analysis, distinguish between two types of contradictions, and definitely distinguish between proletarian power-holders and those taking the capitalist road. Over the past half year or more of the tumultuous mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has been proven that most of our cadres are good and support Chairman Mao. Those leaders who implement the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, we should support them, believe in them, and assist them. For cadres who have made mistakes, we must unshakably implement the policy of "punishing the past to warn the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." We must help them correct their mistakes, encourage them to put down their burdens, and remove various mental obstacles, stand up to rebel against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the revolution through to the end. Currently, some people, in dealing with cadres, do not conduct class analysis, do not distinguish between different situations, do not differentiate between right and wrong, and indiscriminately suspect, oppose, exclude, and overthrow everyone. This is a trend of anarchism. This trend confuses the distinction between revolution and counter-revolution, and between enemy and internal contradictions, and must be resolutely resisted and thoroughly criticized.

The "Wei Dong" Revolutionary Rebel Corps of the former Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, in the struggle for power, actively applied Chairman Mao's works, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, and closely united with revolutionary mid-level and leading cadres, absorbing some revolutionary leading cadres into the rebel corps, smoothly achieving victory in the struggle for power against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They said: We must better implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, achieve the "three-in-one combination" of revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres, and revolutionary mid-level cadres, help those cadres whose consciousness is not yet high to stand up and rebel, truly isolate and thoroughly overthrow a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Revolutionary masses in Shanxi said:

The editorial points out the bright path of combining revolutionary cadres with revolutionary masses. Excellent! Excellent!

After the editorial from the fourth issue of Red Flag magazine reached Shanxi, revolutionary masses spread the news and enthusiastically hailed it. They said, the editorial points out the bright path of combining revolutionary cadres with revolutionary masses. This editorial is excellent! Excellent! Members of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, revolutionary leading cadres such as Liu Ge Ping, and responsible comrades and young revolutionaries from revolutionary mass organizations gathered this morning to collectively study this editorial. Responsible comrades and young revolutionaries from revolutionary mass organizations, in light of the practice of the struggle for power in Shanxi, discussed more and more enthusiastically and deeply. They said, from the practice of the Cultural Revolution in Shanxi over the past few months, it can be seen that cadres at all levels are mostly good and fairly good. In the struggle for power, they have also, to varying degrees, shown their true colors. We must trust them, support them, and unite with them to join the "three-in-one combination" leadership organ. In our leadership organ, with revolutionary leading cadres such as Liu Ge Ping, Zhang Ri Qing, Liu Guan Yi, and Yuan Zhen, not only can we hold power after seizing it, but we can also further achieve the great unity of the revolutionary proletariat, leading the broad revolutionary masses to quickly establish a new revolutionary order.

They said, for cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on their mistakes and are incorrigible, we must follow Chairman Mao's principles of "punishing the past to warn the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," help them correct their mistakes, return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and revolt with us.

Comrade Liu Ge Ping, with great enthusiasm, reviewed the history of the Party's struggles, contrasted the current situation, and expounded on Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on handling cadres. He said, in the history of our Party, some leaders have made rightist errors and "leftist" errors. Those who made "leftist" errors are those who "deny everything" and "strike ruthlessly." Such people eventually overthrew themselves. Our great leader Chairman Mao adopts the correct policy towards cadres who have made mistakes, thus uniting the vast majority of cadres. In the past seventeen years, Chairman Mao's correct line has been dominant, and the vast majority of cadres support Chairman Mao; those who resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are only a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road. Denying this fact is equivalent to denying the great achievements we have made in the past seventeen years. We can only unite and win over the vast majority of cadres who want to revolt, thus uniting the majority of the masses and isolating and striking a handful of bad elements. This is the key to the great unity of the revolutionary proletariat and the victory of the struggle for power against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Revolutionary masses in Qingdao said:

The ship of revolution relies on the helmsman! Chairman Mao always points out the most correct direction for us at crucial moments in the revolutionary struggle.

After the editorial from the fourth issue of Red Flag magazine was broadcast, members of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee were jubilant and said: The ship of revolution relies on the helmsman. Chairman Mao always points out the most correct direction for us at crucial moments in the revolutionary struggle. They said, the practice in Qingdao has proven that revolutionary cadres play a very important role in the revolutionary struggle. Only by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres can we seize and hold power well. In the "August 25" incident in Qingdao, when the revolutionary faction was under heavy attack, former Vice Mayor Wang Xiao Yu stood up and supported the revolutionary youngsters in repelling the enemy's repeated counterattacks; at the critical moment of the revolution, Comrade Wang Xiao Yu actively applied Chairman Mao's works, helped us revolutionary youngsters devise strategies, and achieved a great victory in the struggle for power. After seizing power, batch after batch of revolutionary leading cadres stood with us, bravely shouldering the heavy responsibility of carrying out the revolution and promoting production, making the entire city's industrial and mining enterprises present a prosperous new scene. They also contrasted the editorial of the fourth issue of Red Flag, checking the errors in their previous assessment of the cadre team: seeing only the mistakes of cadres and not seeing their desire to correct them; knowing only to criticize strictly and neglecting patient help. The revolutionary youngsters expressed their determination to seriously restudy Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and resolutely bring the vast majority of cadres back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

A batch after batch of leading cadres who stood up to revolt in Qingdao, after studying this editorial, were very emotional. Comrade Li Yuan Rong, who was recently admitted to the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee and former Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Committee and Mayor, said excitedly: The editorial of the fourth issue of Red Flag points out a clear direction and path for all of us leading cadres who have made mistakes. We are grateful from the bottom of our hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary faction comrades. In the previous Cultural Revolution, due to my worldview not being thoroughly transformed, I was deceived by a handful of power-holders within the provincial and municipal committees who are taking the capitalist road and once implemented the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. It was the revolutionary proletariat who helped me, pulling me out of the mire of mistakes, and admitting me to the revolutionary rebel committee. I will not disappoint the Party and the revolutionary masses' expectations of me. In the past, the main reason for my mistakes was not studying Chairman Mao's works well and my worldview not being thoroughly transformed. In the future, the fundamental issue is to actively apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, take "Three Constantly Read Articles" as my motto, and diligently transform my worldview, forever standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many leading cadres who stood up to revolt, after studying this editorial, expressed their determination to demand more of themselves and strive to achieve new merits and new labor with the revolutionary youngsters in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Some revolutionary leading cadres in Guizhou said:

The editorial fully reflects Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary proletariat and strive to achieve new merits.

In Guiyang, some revolutionary mass organizations organized the study and discussion of the editorial from the fourth issue of Red Flag in light of the actual situation in their region and unit.

Comrade Li Li, a member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, former Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee and Governor, after hearing this editorial on the radio, excitedly said: "This editorial is very important and fully reflects Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I will study it seriously and implement it resolutely." He said: "In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, due to my lack of understanding, I made serious mistakes. I will further check my mistakes with the revolutionary proletariat, thoroughly break with the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, stand on the side of the revolutionary proletariat, work together with the revolutionary proletariat, fight together, and achieve victory together, thoroughly overthrowing a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

Comrade Li Li said: "I made serious mistakes, but it was Chairman Mao who saved me. Now, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses trust me and ask me to serve as a member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, responsible for leading the province's production. I will definitely strive to read Chairman Mao's books, arm my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly transform myself, achieve new merits and new labor in my work, and make amends for my past mistakes."

Last night, after the workers of the Guizhou Agricultural Machinery Tool Factory listened to the broadcast of this editorial, they immediately organized a discussion with the acting secretary of the factory party committee, mid-level leading cadres, and revolutionary proletariat workers. The cadres said with deep feeling: This editorial is an extremely important document guiding the current struggle, the voice of Chairman Mao. We must seriously study this editorial and use the spirit of the editorial to check and correct our past mistakes, strive to achieve new merits, resolutely stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The young revolutionaries of the "September 15" Combat Team of the Red Guards of Guizhou Institute of Technology said after studying this editorial: This editorial is very important and timely. It is the advance signal for us to carry the revolution through to the end and is also an extremely important guiding document for the current rectification of various revolutionary mass organizations. They said, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use the class analysis viewpoint to look at cadres, firmly support revolutionary cadres, fight together with them, unite against the enemy, truly isolate and strike a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road.

Revolutionary masses in Heilongjiang said:

We will resolutely implement the spirit of the editorial and better consolidate and expand the achievements of the "three-in-one combination" seizure of power.

After the editorial from the fourth issue of Red Flag magazine reached Heilongjiang Province, which has already achieved great victories in the struggle for power, the broad masses of the revolutionary proletariat were particularly excited. They said, the editorial of Red Flag speaks to our hearts. The Heilongjiang Provincial Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee held a meeting this morning, with revolutionary youngsters and revolutionary leading cadres sitting together, seriously studying and discussing the spirit of the editorial, and researching specific measures for further implementing the "three-in-one combination." Members of the Revolutionary Committee said: Since the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we have, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, already absorbed more than twenty revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mid-level cadres to work in the Revolutionary Committee. Over the past twenty days, they have worked day and night with the revolutionary youngsters, playing a major role in consolidating the achievements of seizing power. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres.

The revolutionary youngsters said: Whether the Red Rebels implement or do not implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres is a touchstone for testing whether we are genuine leftists or not. Not implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres would inevitably mean implementing the wrong policy on cadres. Practice has proven that we have implemented the "three-in-one combination" after going through serious struggles. Currently, in further implementing the "three-in-one combination," we have encountered some resistance. The publication of the editorial of the fourth issue of Red Flag is Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee pointing out the direction for us and giving us support. This is great, excellent. We will resolutely and unconditionally implement the spirit of the editorial, better consolidate and expand the achievements of the "three-in-one combination" seizure of power.

After the broad revolutionary workers of the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory, which has completed its production plan month after month since the revolutionary proletariat seized power, heard the editorial of Red Flag magazine on the radio, they spread the news. They said, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have pointed out the correct policy and principles for handling cadres, which is like a timely rain! In recent days, the broad revolutionary workers of this factory have been discussing how to correctly handle cadres and summarizing the experience of the Red Rebels and revolutionary leading cadres combining to form a leadership core to carry out the revolution and promote production. The responsible comrade of the Red Rebel Corps of this factory said, from the practice after we seized power, to do well in the revolution and production, we must have revolutionary cadres participating in the leadership core. Before the seizure of power, the two key production workshops in our factory, the fifth and seventh workshops, appeared in the guise of extreme "leftism," wanting to overthrow all cadres, resulting in production losses. After the Red Rebels seized power, they absorbed revolutionary cadres to participate in the workshop leadership, isolated a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, broke the old framework, established a new revolutionary order, and the enthusiasm of the workers for the revolution is higher and higher every day, and production is better and better every day.

The Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee of the Harbin Military Engineering Academy issued a notice early this morning after hearing the broadcast, requiring all Red Rebels and revolutionary teachers and students in the entire academy to seriously study this editorial. At noon, all Red Rebels gathered together, combined with the study of Chairman Mao's quotations, and studied this editorial again. They said: We have won, and we must prevent arrogance, resolutely act according to the spirit of the editorial, and seriously transform our worldview. In dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, we must conduct class analysis and cannot indiscriminately overthrow them. We must not adopt a mocking and sarcastic attitude towards them, and must implement the policy of "punishing the past to warn the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," paying attention to uniting with them, being close to them, helping them recognize and correct their mistakes, making them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and revolting with the Red Rebels to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    上海山西青岛贵州黑龙江的无产阶级革命派欢呼《红旗》第四期社论好得很！
    毛主席的干部政策照亮了夺权斗争的航程
    革命群众坚决地表示要用阶级分析的观点正确地识别干部对待干部真正实现“三结合”
    革命干部激动地表示永远站在毛主席的革命路线一边争取在文化大革命中建立新功劳
    据新华社二十三日讯　《红旗》杂志一九六七年第四期社论《必须正确地对待干部》传到已经取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权伟大胜利的上海、山西、青岛、贵州、黑龙江等省市以后，广大无产阶级革命派无不欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼，并且立即展开了学习讨论。他们说，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，总是在革命斗争的紧要关头，及时地向我们指出最正确的方向。《红旗》这篇社论充分地、正确地体现了毛主席的干部政策，我们一定坚决地、不折不扣地贯彻执行，保证胜利地实现无产阶级革命派大联合，完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的伟大历史任务。上海无产阶级革命派说：
    社论充分体现了毛主席的干部政策，是我们夺权斗争的指南，一定不折不扣地执行！
    上海无产阶级革命派说，这篇社论说出了无产阶级革命派的心里话！它充分地体现了毛主席的干部政策，是我们在夺权斗争中的指南，我们一定要认真地学习，不折不扣地坚决地贯彻执行！
    伟大的“一月革命”实践证明，在需要夺权的地方和单位，必须建立“三结合”的临时权力机构。只有这样，才能把权真正夺过来，把权真正掌起来。上海工人革命造反总司令部的同志学习了《红旗》社论，回顾了夺权斗争的实践，深有体会地说：建立“三结合”的临时权力机构，在当前必须着重解决正确对待革命干部问题。对待干部，我们要进行阶级分析，要区别两类不同性质的矛盾，一定要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路的当权派。经过半年多以来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的考验，证明我们的干部大多数是好的，是拥护毛主席的。那些执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，我们应当拥护他们，相信他们，支持他们。对于犯有错误的干部，我们要毫不动摇地实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策。要帮助他们改正错误，要鼓励他们放下包袱，解除各种思想顾虑，起来造一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反，迅速地回到毛主席的革命路线上来，将革命进行到底。目前有些人对待干部，不作阶级分析，不区别对待，不分青红皂白，一概怀疑，一概反对，一概排斥，一概打倒，这是一种无政府主义的思潮。这种思潮混淆革命和反革命的区别，混淆敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，必须坚决抵制和彻底批判。
    前共青团上海市委机关的卫东革命造反兵团，在夺权斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，坚定地执行毛主席的干部政策，同革命的中级干部和领导干部紧密团结在一起，把一些革命领导干部吸收到造反兵团中来，顺利地取得了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的胜利。他们说：我们一定要更好地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，做到革命群众、革命领导干部、革命的中级干部的三结合，帮助那些觉悟还不高的干部起来造反，把一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派真正孤立起来，彻底打倒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！山西无产阶级革命派说：
    社论指出了广大革命干部和广大革命群众相结合的光明大道。一千个好！一万个好！
    《红旗》杂志第四期社论传到山西以后，无产阶级革命派奔走相告，热烈欢呼。他们说，社论指出了广大革命干部和广大革命群众相结合的光明大道。这个社论好得很！一千个好，一万个好！山西革命造反总指挥部领导成员、革命领导干部刘格平同志，同革命群众组织的负责人、革命小将们，今天上午在一起集体学习了这篇社论。革命群众组织的负责人和革命小将们对照山西夺权斗争的实践，越谈越起劲，越谈越深切。他们说，从山西几个月来文化大革命实践中看出，各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。在夺权斗争中，他们也程度不同地亮了相，我们要信赖他们，拥护他们，支持他们，争取、团结他们到“三结合”的领导机构中来。在我们的领导机构中，有了刘格平、张日清、刘贯一、袁振等革命的领导干部，夺权后不仅能掌权，而且进一步实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合，带领广大革命群众迅速建立起革命的新秩序。
    他们说，对犯错误的干部，只要他们不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，我们要遵照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，帮助他们改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和我们一道革命。
    刘格平同志满腔热情地回顾了党的斗争历史，对照了当前的斗争形势，阐述了毛主席对待干部的光辉思想。他说，我党历史上有些领导人犯过右倾错误，也犯过“左”倾错误。犯“左”倾错误的人，就是“否定一切”、“无情打击”，这种人最后把自己也打倒了。我们伟大领袖毛主席对犯错误的干部采取正确的方针，才把绝大多数干部团结过来。解放十七年来，毛主席的正确路线是占优势的，干部绝大多数是拥护毛主席的；对抗毛主席革命路线的只是一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。否认这个事实，就等于否认我们十七年来所取得的伟大成就。我们只有团结争取绝大多数要革命的干部，才能团结大多数群众，孤立和打击一小撮坏家伙。这是我们无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争取得胜利的关键。青岛无产阶级革命派说：
    大海航行靠舵手！毛主席总是在革命斗争的紧要关头给我们指出最正确的方向。
    青岛市革命造反委员会的常委们从广播里听到了《红旗》杂志第四期社论之后欢欣鼓舞地说：大海航行靠舵手，毛主席总是在革命斗争的紧要关头给我们指出最正确的方向。他们说，青岛的实践经验证明，革命干部在革命斗争中有着很重要的作用。只有坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，才能夺好权，掌好权。青岛“八·二五”事件中，当革命派受到重重围攻的时候，前青岛市副市长王效禹同志挺身而出，支持革命小将击退阶级敌人的一次次反扑；在革命的关键时刻，王效禹同志活学活用毛主席著作，帮助我们革命小将出谋划策，一举取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。夺取政权以后，一批又一批革命的领导干部同我们站在一起，勇敢地挑起抓革命，促生产的重担，使全市工矿企业呈现一派欣欣向荣新气象。他们还对照《红旗》第四期社论，检查了前段对干部队伍估计上的错误：只看到干部犯错误，看不到干部想改正；只知道批判从严，忽视了耐心帮助。革命小将们表示，一定要认真地重新学习毛主席的干部政策，下决心把绝大多数干部挽回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    青岛市一批又一批站起来革命的各级领导干部，在学习了这篇社论后，感情十分激动。刚被吸收参加青岛市革命造反委员会的前青岛市委书记处书记、市长李元荣同志激动地说：《红旗》第四期社论，给我们所有犯过错误的领导干部指出了明确的方向和道路，我们从心里感谢伟大的领袖毛主席，感谢革命派同志们。在前段文化大革命中，由于自己的世界观没有得到彻底改造，受了前省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，曾一度执行了资产阶级反动路线。是无产阶级革命派帮助了我，把我从错误的泥坑里挽救出来，并且吸收我参加了革命造反委员会。我决不辜负党和革命群众对我的期望。过去，我犯错误的原因，主要是对毛主席著作没学好，主观世界没有得到彻底改造。今后，根本的问题是要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，刻苦改造世界观，永远站在毛主席革命路线这一边。许多站起来的革命干部学习了这篇社论以后，纷纷表示要更加严格地要求自己，决心同革命小将一起在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功，立新劳。贵州一些革命领导干部说：
    社论充分体现了毛主席的革命路线。坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，争取立新功。
    在贵阳，一些革命群众组织联系本地区本单位的实际情况，组织了对《红旗》第四期社论的学习讨论。
    贵州省革命委员会委员、原贵州省委书记处书记、省长李立同志，从广播里听到了这一社论后兴奋地说：“这篇社论很重要，充分体现了毛主席的革命路线，我要认真地学习，坚决地贯彻执行。”他说：“我在文化大革命初期由于认识不清，犯了很大错误。我一定进一步向无产阶级革命派检查自己的错误，彻底同资产阶级反动路线决裂，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在无产阶级革命派的一边，同无产阶级革命派工作在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，彻底把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗垮、斗倒、斗臭。”　
    李立同志说：“我犯了严重错误，是毛主席他老人家挽救了我。现在，革命干部和革命群众对我信任，要我担任贵州省革命委员会委员，负责领导全省生产。我一定要努力读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断改造自己，在工作中立新功，立新劳，将功补过。”
    贵阳农机工具厂的无产阶级革命派，昨晚收听了这篇社论的广播后，立即组织了厂党委代理书记、中级领导干部和无产阶级革命派工人一起进行了座谈。干部们深有体会地说：这篇社论，是指导当前斗争的极为重要的文件，是毛主席他老人家的声音。我们一定认真地学好这篇社论，并以社论精神来对照检查过去的错误，争取立新功，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    贵州工学院红卫兵“九·一五”战斗团的小将们学习了这一社论后说：这一社论十分重要，十分及时。它是引导我们将革命进行到底的进军号，也是当前各革命群众组织进行整风的极重要的指导文件。他们说，我们要遵照毛主席的教导，用阶级分析观点看待干部，对革命的干部要坚决支持，要和他们一起战斗，团结对敌，真正孤立和打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。黑龙江无产阶级革命派说：
    我们坚决贯彻执行社论的精神，更好地巩固和扩大“三结合”夺权的成果。
    《红旗》杂志第四期社论传到已经取得夺权斗争伟大胜利的黑龙江省之后，广大无产阶级革命派感到特别兴奋。他们说，《红旗》社论句句都说到了我们心坎上。黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会在当天上午召开会议，革命小将和革命领导干部坐在一起，认真学习和讨论了社论的精神，研究了进一步贯彻“三结合”的具体措施。革命委员会的委员们说：自从省革命委员会建立以来，我们按照毛主席的教导，已经吸收了二十多名革命领导干部和革命的中级干部到革命委员会里来工作。二十多天来，他们夜以继日地和革命小将战斗在一起，对巩固夺权成果起了重大作用。这是毛主席干部政策的伟大胜利。
    革命小将们说：红色造反者执行还是不执行毛主席的干部政策，是考验我们是真左派还是假左派的试金石。不执行毛主席的干部政策，就必然执行错误的干部政策。实践证明，我们实行“三结合”是经过了严重的斗争的。当前，我们在进一步执行“三结合”的时候，又遇到了一些阻力。《红旗》杂志第四期社论的发表，是毛主席、党中央给我们指出了方向，给我们撑了腰，这太好了，好极了。我们坚决地不折不扣地贯彻执行社论的精神，更好地巩固和扩大“三结合”夺权的成果。
    在无产阶级革命派夺权以后，生产计划月月超额完成的哈尔滨林业机械厂的广大革命职工，从广播里听到《红旗》杂志社论以后，奔走相告。他们说，毛主席、党中央给我们指出了正确对待干部的方针政策，这真是及时雨！最近几天，这个工厂的广大革命职工正在讨论怎样正确对待干部，并且总结红色造反者同革命领导干部结合组成领导班子抓革命，促生产的经验。这个工厂的红色造反团负责人说，从我们夺权以后的实践来看，要想搞好革命和生产，必须有革命干部参加领导核心。我们厂的五车间和七车间是全厂的生产关键部门。夺权以前，这两个车间的保守派以极“左”的面目出现，要打倒一切干部，结果生产受到损失。红色造反者夺权以后，吸收了革命干部参加车间领导班子，孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，破了旧框框，建立了革命的新秩序，职工的革命劲头一天比一天高，生产一天比一天好。
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反者革命委员会听到广播后，今天一早就发出通知，要求全院红色造反者和革命师生，认真学习这篇社论。中午，全体红色造反者聚集在一起，结合学习毛主席语录，又一次学习了这篇社论。他们说：我们胜利了，一定要防止骄傲情绪，坚决按照社论精神办事，认真地改造自己的世界观。对待犯了错误的干部，要作阶级分析，不能一概打倒。对他们绝不能采取冷嘲热讽的态度，一定要执行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，注意团结他们，亲近他们，帮助他们认识和改正错误，使他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和红色造反者一起闹革命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
