Sixteen revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanxi resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call
Issue an urgent appeal for frugality to revolutionize the entire province and the country
Revolutionary rebels must act quickly, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and save every penny, every inch of cloth, every grain of rice, every watt of electricity, and every drop of oil for the country and the revolution; they must think of every possible way to eliminate all wasteful phenomena and forever preserve the proletarian spirit of hard struggle.

New China News Agency, Taiyuan, February 8th — On February 1st, sixteen revolutionary rebel organizations, including the Shanxi Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Death Squad, issued an urgent appeal for frugality to revolutionize to all revolutionary rebels in the province and the country. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

Urgent Appeal

Supreme Directive: Seizing victory nationwide is only the first step in a journey of ten thousand miles. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is even longer, the work even greater, and the struggle even harder. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried attitude, and continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us more than thirty years ago: "Saving every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system." Now, at this critical moment when the proletarian revolutionaries are uniting to seize power from the capitalist roaders, Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "save and revolutionize." This is the sharpest and most powerful ideological weapon for us revolutionary rebels to resist the corruption of economism, smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and forever preserve the glorious tradition of hard struggle and the firmness of the proletarian revolution.

Thrift and simplicity are not just matters of lifestyle, but of ideological style, political attitude, and stance. Frugality and waste are the fundamental opposites of the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview.

Hard struggle and simplicity are the essence of the proletariat. A true proletarian revolutionary, under any conditions, must "save and revolutionize."

Whoever does not establish the idea of "saving and revolutionizing" is not a true proletarian revolutionary. Now, the revolutionary rebels in Shanxi Province have seized power from the provincial and municipal committees and other departments, and have taken the stage of politics, pointing out the direction and commanding the winds. The revolutionary situation is excellent! However, due to the vicious influence of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who are crazily promoting counter-revolutionary economism, and due to the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas in the minds of some comrades, there are still serious phenomena of showing off, flaunting wealth, and wasting national property in some revolutionary organizations and individuals. To thoroughly eliminate the remnants of counter-revolutionary economism, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and ensure that our proletarian rebels do not change color after seizing power, we, the sixteen revolutionary organizations, follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "saving and revolutionizing," based on the problems that currently exist, and in accordance with the principle of "focusing on the big picture and starting with the small details," specially propose the following points to all revolutionary rebels in the province and the country:

(1) All proletarian revolutionary rebels must resolutely and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's directive to "save and revolutionize," find ways, and take measures to not issue vouchers at will, eliminate all unnecessary expenses, and strictly control the financial reimbursement system.

(2) All proletarian revolutionary rebels have the responsibility to protect state property. During the seizure of power and rebellious actions, state property must be protected, and sabotage by bad elements must be prevented. Those counter-revolutionaries who deliberately sabotage state property must be firmly suppressed.

(3) Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." Generally, production units should not hold large-scale parades or other large-scale activities. The staff of various revolutionary organizations should generally not leave their posts.

(4) Carry forward the fine tradition of proletarian thrift and simplicity, do not establish a bureaucratic system and material equipment that is detached from the masses. In the spirit of saving and revolutionizing, transportation tools should be used economically. Do not show off or flaunt wealth; do not arbitrarily intercept or commandeer production and transportation tools, and ensure the normal operation of state production and transportation.

(5) Printing propaganda materials should be planned, efforts should be made to improve printing quality, attention should be paid to distribution methods and propaganda effects, and in the new situation of gradually achieving great unity, efforts should be made to unify the printing and distribution of leaflets, and cooperate with each other. The principle of saving and doing things should be followed to save paper, ink, and other cultural supplies, and materials should not be hoarded.

(6) Various revolutionary organizations should strictly control the use of long-distance telephones. Conversations should be concise and to the point, saving time and avoiding long and idle chats.

(7) Various revolutionary organizations should not arbitrarily occupy public housing. If it directly affects the normal work of the original unit or if there is surplus, it should be returned as much as possible.

(8) At present, the proletarian revolutionary rebels are implementing great unity, and the cultural revolution in rural areas is about to be fully launched. New revolutionary organizations are being established in large numbers, requiring a large number of armbands, flags, and other items to be made or replaced. Various revolutionary organizations should follow the principle of saving and doing things, not making what can be avoided, and not replacing what can be avoided, striving to avoid multiple and repeated production. Those that must be made should save as much cloth as possible, and it is suggested to use small badges such as chest badges and armbands.

(9) During the period of rampant counter-revolutionary economism, a large number of cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and other transportation tools and equipment have been issued. Various revolutionary organizations should actively return them as appropriate to save national resources and support production and construction.

(10) The above points are hoped to be widely publicized and voluntarily implemented by various revolutionary organizations.

Comrades of the revolutionary rebels, let us act quickly, carry forward the spirit of saving every penny, and save every penny, every inch of cloth, every grain of rice, every watt of electricity, and every drop of oil for the country and the revolution. Think of every possible way to eliminate all wasteful phenomena, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and "save and revolutionize," forever preserving the heroic spirit of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, and swearing to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Down with economism!
Thoroughly purge the poison of economism!
Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels!
Long live the victory of the proletarian seizure of power!
Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman, and great teacher, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    山西十六个革命造反组织坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召
    向全省全国发出节约闹革命紧急倡议
    革命造反派要迅速行动起来，发扬艰苦奋斗精神，为国家、为革命节约一分钱，一寸布，一粒粮，一度电，一滴油；想尽一切办法，杜绝一切浪费现象，永葆无产阶级艰苦奋斗的本色。
    新华社太原八日电　山西革命工人造反决死纵队等十六个革命造反组织二月一
  日向全省全国的革命造反派发出节约闹革命的紧急倡议。倡议全文如下：
    紧急倡议
    最高指示：夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早在三十多年前就教导我们：“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。”现在，在无产阶级革命派联合起来，大夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的关键时刻，毛主席又发出了
  “要节约闹革命”的伟大号召。这是我们革命造反派用以抵抗经济主义的腐蚀，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，永葆艰苦奋斗的光荣传统和无产阶级革命坚定性的最锐利最强大的思想武器。
    勤俭节约、艰苦朴素，决不仅仅是个生活作风问题，而是思想作风问题，是政治态度问题，是立场问题。节约和浪费，就是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的根本对立。
    艰苦朴素是无产阶级的本色。一个真正的无产阶级革命派，在任何条件下，都必须“要节约闹革命”。
    谁不树立“要节约闹革命”的思想，谁就不是真正的无产阶级革命派。现在，我们山西省的革命造反派夺回了省、市委及其它一些部门的党、政、财、文大权，登上了政治舞台，指点江山，叱咤风云，革命形势，一片大好！但是由于一小撮反革命修正主义分子疯狂推行反革命经济主义的恶劣影响，以及我们某些同志头脑中存在着资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，所以至今在一些革命组织和个人中还存在着较严重的讲排场，摆阔气，挥霍浪费国家财产的现象。为彻底清除反革命经济主义的余毒，彻底击垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，保证我们无产阶级造反派掌权后永不变色，我们十六个革命组织遵循毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，根据现在普遍存在的问题，本着“大处着眼，小处着手”的原则，特向全省全国的革命造反派提出以下几点倡议：
    （一）一切无产阶级革命造反派都要坚决地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，想办法，定措施，不要随便开条子，杜绝一切不必要的开支，严格控制财务报销制度。
    （二）一切无产阶级革命造反派都有保护国家财产的责任。在进行夺权、造反等革命行动时，必须爱护国家财产，严防坏人乘机破坏。对于那些别有用心、破坏国家财产的现行反革命分子，必须坚决镇压。
    （三）坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，一般情况下，各生产单位不要搞大规模的游行示威或其他大型活动。各革命组织的工作人员，一般不要脱离生产。
    （四）发扬无产阶级艰苦朴素的优良传统，不要搞一套脱离群众的官僚主义机构和物质装备。要本着节约闹革命的精神，节约使用交通运输工具。不要讲排场，闹阔气；不得任意拦截、调用生产运输工具，切实保证国家生产和交通运输的正常进行。
    （五）印刷宣传品要有计划，努力提高印刷质量，注意散发方法和宣传效果，在逐步实现大联合的新形势下，尽量做到印发传单统一筹划，互相配合。要本着既节约、又办事的原则，节省纸张、油墨等文化用品，不得积压物资。
    （六）各革命组织要严格控制长途电话的使用。通话时要简明扼要，节约时间，避免长谈、闲谈。
    （七）各革命组织不应随意占用公房。若直接影响原单位正常工作和占用有余的应尽量退回。
    （八）目前，无产阶级革命造反派正在实行大联合，农村无产阶级文化大革命即将全面展开，新的革命组织纷纷建立，需要大量制做或更换袖章、旗帜等。各革命组织应本着节约办事的原则，能不制的就不制，能不更换的就不更换，力求避免多制和重制。必须制做的要尽量想法节约用布，建议采用胸章、臂章等小型标志。
    （九）在反革命经济主义泛滥时期，大量发放下去的汽车、摩托车、自行车等交通工具及其他物资装备，各革命组织应主动酌量退回，以节约国家资材，支援生产建设。
    （十）上述各条希各革命组织广泛宣传，自觉执行。
    革命造反派的战友们，让我们迅速地行动起来，发扬一厘钱精神，为国家、为革命节约一分钱，一寸布，一粒粮，一度电，一滴油。想尽一切办法，杜绝一切浪费现象，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，永葆无产阶级革命造反派的英雄本色，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    打倒经济主义！
    彻底肃清经济主义的流毒！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    无产阶级革命造反派大联合万岁！
    无产阶级夺权胜利万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
