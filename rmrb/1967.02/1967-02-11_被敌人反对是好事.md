A Cuban student who has read many works by Chairman Mao discussed with Chinese comrades how he applies Mao Zedong Thought to view the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said: "We must apply Chairman Mao's principle that 'being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing' to observe problems. The more fiercely imperialism and revisionism denounce the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the more it makes us realize that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a good thing, a great thing."

He said: "Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are all terrified of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Revisionism is even more frightened because they fear that if the Red Guards rise up and rebel in their own countries, they will be overthrown."

He praised the great democracy practiced in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, saying: "Only China has true democracy. Ordinary workers can criticize leaders, no matter how high their position, how senior their status, or how important their work. As long as they make mistakes, the people can criticize them. Which revisionist country dares to do this?"

    被敌人反对是好事
    一位古巴学生阅读了许多毛主席著作，他和中国同志谈到他怎样运用毛泽东思想来看中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说：“我们必须运用毛主席的‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’这一原理来观察问题。帝国主义和修正主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命骂得越凶，越使我们认识到，中国无产阶级文化大革命是一件好事，是一件大事。”
    他说：“帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派都对中国文化大革命怕得要死。修正主义怕得更厉害，因为他们害怕在他们国内一旦出现红卫兵，起来造反闹革命，那他们就要垮台了。”
    他赞扬在由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命中实行的大民主，他说：“中国才有真正的民主，普通工人都可以批评领导人，不管他的地位多高，资格多老，担任多重要的工作，只要他们有错误，人民就可以批评。哪一个修正主义国家敢于这样做呢？”
