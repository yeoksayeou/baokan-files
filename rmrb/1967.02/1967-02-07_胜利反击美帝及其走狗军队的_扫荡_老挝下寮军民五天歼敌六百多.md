According to a battle report issued by the Southern Laos Regional Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army on January 25, the people's liberation army and civilians in the southern region of Laos have fully demonstrated the invincible power of people's war. In the recent counterattack against the large-scale "sweeping" operations by the U.S. imperialists and their running dog troops, they have achieved the glorious results of annihilating more than six hundred enemy troops in just five days.

	The battle report states that on January 15, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs mobilized more than ten battalions of troops, with the support of U.S. aircraft and artillery, to launch a large-scale "sweeping" operation in the liberated areas of Saravane, Attapeu, and Champasak provinces. The people's liberation army and civilians in the southern region, who were well-prepared, fought bravely day and night in close coordination, giving the invading enemy a heavy blow. In just five days, from January 15 to January 20, the people's liberation army and civilians in the southern region launched fifteen consecutive brave battles, annihilating a total of 628 enemy troops, including 369 killed, 259 wounded, captured, or surrendered.
