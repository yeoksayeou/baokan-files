The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great mass movement to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought. We, the Red Rebels, are the brave pioneers in this mass movement.

To revolutionize and to rebel, we must first clarify for whom we are revolutionizing and why we are rebelling. As early as 1947, Comrade Lin Biao said: "We are the people's army, a 'rebellious' force, rebelling against the old ruling class, for the liberation of the broad masses of the people, not for ourselves or for any individual, not just for food." In the past, some people, because they did not fundamentally establish this revolutionary worldview, ended up stumbling on the revolutionary path. Some were satisfied as long as they had enough to eat; some, for personal desires, did all sorts of dirty things; some even took the path of revisionism, completely losing their former rebellious spirit. Such people are not absent in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Those who put "self" first are not true Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought revolutionaries; at most, they are fellow travelers and political opportunists of the revolutionary cause, because they are only for themselves or their own clique, not for the broad masses of the people. Can we, the Red Rebels, follow in their footsteps? Absolutely not!

In this unprecedented Cultural Revolution, the general direction of our Red Rebels has always been correct, and we are truly loyal soldiers of Chairman Mao. However, this does not mean that each of us has already established a revolutionary worldview. In this movement, we still have various shortcomings and even mistakes in our politics, organization, ideology, and actions. We must recognize that if we do not overcome our ideological problems in a timely manner, it will affect the cause of the proletarian revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party within the Fourth Red Army has various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly rectified, the great revolutionary struggle given to the Fourth Red Army by the Chinese revolution will not be able to be undertaken." Therefore, we must not, because we have taken the right path, stop cleaning the dust off our faces and become conceited.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link for uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." Now, we are in a great situation of pursuing the enemy to the end. At this time, it is easiest to become arrogant and develop individualism, so we need to strengthen ideological education and carry out self-reform. Only in this way can we raise the political level of the rebels and form a great alliance of revolution, successfully completing the revolutionary tasks given to us by Chairman Mao.

The Cultural Revolution is a great struggle to transform both the objective world and the subjective world of each individual. Therefore, we Red Rebels, in the process of transforming the objective world, must also transform our subjective world. We should dare to rebel against everything in our minds that goes against Mao Zedong Thought, and we should take the non-proletarian thoughts in our minds as targets and hit them hard. In a word, we must touch our souls.

Transforming the objective world and transforming the subjective world are dialectically unified. Without the determination to break with old ideas and without a firm revolutionary spirit of rebellion, it is impossible to rise up in the Cultural Revolution and change the objective world. Only by fully engaging in the great revolutionary struggle, by charging ahead in the torrent of transforming the objective world, can we promote our ideological reform, raise our consciousness, and increase our abilities. We must respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin and take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, truly raising our class consciousness and political level. In struggle, we must establish a proletarian worldview, follow Chairman Mao through storms and waves, temper ourselves, and cultivate ourselves into red revolutionary successors, creating a new world of Mao Zedong Thought that is red all over.

    在斗争中树立革命的世界观
    某军医大学红色造反纵队
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场大灭资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。我们红色造反者是群众运动中的勇敢闯将。
    要革命，要造反，首先要明确为谁革命，为什么造反。早在一九四七年，林彪同志说：“我们是人民的军队，是‘造反’的队伍，是为了反对旧的统治阶级，是为了广大人民的解放，而不是为了自己或者那一个人，不是为了吃粮。”过去，有些人因为没有从根本上确立这个革命的世界观，结果在革命路上跌了跤。他们有的只要吃足“粮”就心满意足了；有的为了个人私欲，干尽了腌腌臜臜的事情；有的甚至走上了修正主义的道路，昔日的造反精神全丢净了。这样的人，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中也不是没有的。“私”字当头的人，不是真正的马列主义、毛泽东思想的革命造反派，至多不过是造反派的同路人和政治上的投机商，因为他们只是为了自己或者自己一伙的人，却不是为了广大人民。我们红色造反者能重蹈这些人的覆辙吗？绝对不能！
    在这场史无前例的文化大革命中，我们红色造反者的大方向始终是正确的，我们无愧为毛主席的忠实战士。但这并不说明我们每个人都已经确立了革命的世界观，我们在运动中还存在着政治上、组织上、思想上、行动上的各种缺点甚至错误。我们必须认识到，我们思想上的问题如果不及时加以克服，那就会影响到无产阶级的革命事业。毛主席教导我们说：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”因此，我们决不能因为自己走对了路，就不去洗刷自己脸上的灰尘，而自命不凡起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”现在，我们正处于乘胜追击穷寇的大好形势下，这个时候往往最容易使人骄傲，容易产生个人主义，因此就最需要加强思想教育，进行自我思想改造。只有这样，才有利于造反派政治水平的提高和革命大联合的形成，胜利地完成毛主席交给我们的革命任务。
    文化大革命既是一场改造客观世界的伟大斗争，又是一场改造每个人主观世界的伟大斗争。因此，我们红色造反者在改造客观世界的过程中，必须同时改造自己的主观世界。我们应当敢于造自己头脑中一切违反毛泽东思想的东西的反，应当把自己头脑里的非无产阶级思想作为靶子，狠狠地打。一句话，就是必须触及自己的灵魂。
    改造客观世界和改造主观世界，两者是辩证的统一。没有与旧思想决裂的决心，没有坚定的革命造反精神，要想在文化大革命中起来造反，起来改变客观世界，那是不可能的。只有很好地投入了伟大的革命斗争，在改造客观世界的急流中冲锋陷阵，才能促进自己的思想改造，提高觉悟，增长才干。我们一定要响应林副主席的号召，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，切切实实地提高自己的阶级觉悟和政治水平，在斗争中树立无产阶级世界观，跟着毛主席在大风大浪中经受锻炼，培养自己成为红色的革命接班人，创造出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。
