Revolutionary rebels in Beijing, Shanghai, and other provinces and municipalities enthusiastically hail the new experience created by comrades in Heilongjiang that embodies Mao Zedong Thought: "Three-in-One" Joint Seizure of Power.

The great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary rebels must establish a core of "three-in-one" combination of leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, leaders of stationed troops, and revolutionary leading cadres to achieve victory in the struggle for power seizure. It is essential to strictly implement the policy on cadres formulated by Chairman Mao, to adopt the principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity" for cadres who have made general mistakes, in order to win the sincere support of the majority.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, revolutionary rebels in seven provinces and municipalities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shanxi, Guizhou, Shandong, and Heilongjiang have enthusiastically hailed and seriously studied the "Basic Experience of the Power Seizure Struggle by Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province" and the editorial "A Good Example of the Power Seizure Struggle by the Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels" in the People's Daily. Revolutionary rebel warriors unanimously praised: The experience of power seizure struggle created by the revolutionary rebel comrades in Heilongjiang Province shines with the brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought. At this critical moment of the great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their agents within the party, it has provided revolutionary weapons for proletarian revolutionary rebels across the country and made a valuable contribution to the great proletarian cultural revolution.

Many revolutionary rebel organizations in the capital have broadcast the basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province and the editorial of the People's Daily from morning to evening on the 10th, organizing revolutionary rebels to study, discuss, and hold symposiums. Comrades from the Red Rebel Liaison Station of the Beijing Crane Factory felt from their own practice of power seizure struggle that the experience of "three-in-one, joint seizure of power" in Heilongjiang Province is very precious. They said, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution. The basic reason why all previous revolutionary struggles in China have achieved little is that we have not been able to unite true friends to attack true enemies." In the struggle for power seizure, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, distinguish between enemies and friends. We cannot believe that all those in power are to be distrusted. To oppose everything indiscriminately, exclude everything, and overthrow everything is contrary to the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought class standpoint. Those leading cadres who genuinely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are an important factor in the "three-in-one" combination. We must closely unite with them, direct our spearheads at the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, seize their power, and remove their positions. Only by implementing the "three-in-one" combination can we ensure that we seize real power and consolidate the power.

Many revolutionary rebel organizations in factories, schools, and offices in Shanghai have seriously studied and discussed the basic experience of the power seizure struggle in Heilongjiang Province and the editorial of the People's Daily. They believe that at this critical moment when the power seizure struggle is unfolding nationwide, the publication of these two documents once again brings the voice of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, which is the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary rebels. Many revolutionary rebel organizations reviewed their own struggle practice and said, "three-in-one, joint seizure of power" is the core of the basic experience of the power seizure struggle in Heilongjiang Province. The practice of power seizure struggle in Shanghai also proves that without the "three-in-one" combination and without implementing "three-in-one, joint seizure of power," the struggle for power seizure cannot be victorious, and even if power is seized, it cannot be truly held. Now, some people do not make specific analyses of cadres but indiscriminately attack all those in power, which is completely wrong and contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. Some leaders of revolutionary rebel groups also expressed that the basic experience of the power seizure struggle in Heilongjiang is a truly significant document that embodies Mao Zedong Thought. It shines with the brilliant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We must learn well from the red rebel comrades in Heilongjiang Province and use these experiences in the struggle to achieve a thorough victory in the power seizure struggle.

The revolutionary rebel warriors in Tianjin said excitedly that the new experience created by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province, which truly embodies Mao Zedong Thought, will surely blossom and bear fruit in Tianjin and across the country. Some revolutionary rebel cadres from the Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee pointed out in a symposium that the four experiences of Heilongjiang are very important and timely, providing an excellent example for our current power seizure struggle. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with various brother revolutionary rebel organizations, unite with revolutionary leading cadres, and with the main leaders of the People's Liberation Army, implement "three-in-one, joint seizure of power" to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in Tianjin to the end. Soldiers from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tianjin, after listening to the broadcast, enthusiastically swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "We will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and be your good soldiers. According to your teachings, we will firmly support the revolutionary rebels and fight together with the revolutionary rebels, and achieve victory together."

The basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province has reached Shanxi, and the revolutionary rebel warriors who have seized the power of the party and government organs in Shanxi all feel particularly close. Representative Yang Chengxiao of the revolutionary mass organizations of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters said that this experience is a "magic weapon" for the revolutionary rebels to launch a power seizure struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and it is also a "magic weapon" for the revolutionary rebels to hold power well. Our Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters is a power organ formed in the power seizure struggle with the "three-in-one, joint seizure of power" structure. We revolutionary rebels have united with the main leaders of the party and government organs in Shanxi Province who implement Chairman Mao's correct line, such as Liu Geping, Liu Guan, and Yuan Zhen, and the second political commissar of the Shanxi Military Region, Zhang Riquing, and actively proposed that they participate in the core leadership of the General Headquarters, which has played an important role in the power seizure and holding power by the Shanxi revolutionary rebels. After seizing power, they also worked with us to summarize the experience of mass struggles, gradually improve the organization, and unite more revolutionary masses around the General Headquarters, firmly holding the great power in the hands of the revolutionary rebels. Yang Chengxiao also talked about the revolutionary friendship between the second political commissar of the Shanxi Military Region, Zhang Riquing, and the broad cadres and soldiers of the PLA, who have fought side by side with the revolutionary rebels in life-and-death struggles, believing that the victory of Shanxi's power seizure is also inseparable from the active support of the PLA. The young revolutionary warriors of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Brigade emphasized in the symposium on the basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province that in the power seizure struggle, we must strictly implement the policy on cadres formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao. To indiscriminately kick out and overthrow all those in power is adventurism, is pseudo-leftism and rightism, and is completely contrary to Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary warriors of the proletarian revolutionary rebels in the Guizhou region of Guiyang expressed that they would repeatedly and seriously study the basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province to guide their actions. Li Zaichan, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and deputy political commissar of the Guizhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: Without the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, there would be no victory in the power seizure struggle. And this great alliance must have the "three-in-one" combination of leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, leaders of local stationed troops, and revolutionary leading cadres of party and government organs as its core. Otherwise, even if power is seized, it cannot be firmly held or consolidated. In the power seizure, we must insist on implementing the "three-in-one" combination, fully trusting the revolutionary cadres in our units. Revolutionary cadres are the precious assets of the party. For cadres, we must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions and adopt the policy of differentiated treatment. For cadres who have made mistakes, we must genuinely implement the party's traditional policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient." We cannot doubt everything, overthrow everything, and exclude everything. Only in this way can we continuously expand the leftist forces, unite the majority, and achieve victory in the power seizure struggle. Comrades from the General Headquarters of the Guiyang Combat Team of Mao Zedong Thought said: In the power seizure struggle, we revolutionary rebels must take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest criterion for action, strengthen unity, consolidate combat friendship, break down the "self" and establish the "public."

Revolutionary rebels in the cities of Jinan and Qingdao in Shandong Province enthusiastically praised the basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province, setting a living example for the current great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary rebels. Comrade Wang Xiaoyu, a revolutionary leading cadre in Qingdao, linked the power seizure struggle in Qingdao and said: Correctly implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres is a particularly important issue that deserves attention in the current power seizure struggle. For those in power, we must distinguish between them. For cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements and insist on not changing and are incorrigible, we should adopt the principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity" to win them over and educate them. This is Chairman Mao's consistent policy and our responsibility. Comrades from the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters of Shandong Workers said, in the power seizure struggle, we also deeply feel that to seize and consolidate power, we must unite with the leading cadres in the provincial party committee who implement Chairman Mao's correct line and achieve "three-in-one, joint seizure of power." For leading cadres, we must conduct class analysis and firmly implement Chairman Mao's correct line. Those who implement it, we must unite with them, respect them, and support them. We oppose the wrong practice of indiscriminately overthrowing all leading cadres. We revolutionary workers are the most capable of identifying and cherishing cadres and implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. We will resolutely fight against those who sabotage Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. The responsible comrade of the Jinan Military Region said, all our cadres and soldiers must humbly learn from the model experience of Heilongjiang's power seizure struggle and apply the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works actively to the power seizure struggle in Shandong. In the complex class struggle, we will resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely support the leftists to seize power, and resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities of the class enemies attempting to seize power.

After hearing the editorial "A Good Example of the Power Seizure Struggle by the Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels" from the People's Daily on the radio, the broad masses in Harbin enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" They said, this is Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's greatest support, greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest exhortation to us, the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province. We will not disappoint his expectations and will definitely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. The Red Rebels of the Harbin Military Engineering Academy excitedly said, many experiences of the power seizure struggle by the Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province boil down to one thing: honestly following Chairman Mao's teachings. The achievement of this experience is entirely due to our great leader Chairman Mao.

    北京上海等省市革命派欢呼黑龙江战友创造体现毛泽东思想的新经验
    “三位一体　联合夺权”
    无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权，必须建立革命群众组织负责人、驻军负责人和革命领导干部的“三结合”的核心，才能取得夺权斗争的胜利；必须不折不扣地执行毛主席制定的干部政策，对于那些犯有一般错误的干部，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，才能取得大多数人的衷心拥护。
    据新华社十日电　北京、上海、天津、山西、贵州、山东、黑龙江等七省市的广大革命造反派，热烈欢呼和认真学习《黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验》和《人民日报》社论《无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的一个好范例》。革命造反派战士们一致赞扬：黑龙江省革命造反派战友们创造的夺权斗争的经验，闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，在当前无产阶级同资产阶级及其在党内代理人大决战的关键时刻，为全国无产阶级革命造反派战士送来了革命武器，为伟大的无产阶级文化大革命作出了宝贵的贡献。
    首都许多单位的革命造反派组织的广播站，十日从早到晚，一次又一次地广播了黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验和《人民日报》的社论，并组织革命造反者学习、讨论和座谈。北京起重机厂红色造反者联络站的同志们，从自己夺权斗争的实践中感到，黑龙江省“三位一体，联合夺权”的经验非常宝贵。他们说，我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。中国过去一切革命斗争成效甚少，其基本原因就是因为不能团结真正的朋友，以攻击真正的敌人。”在夺权斗争中，我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，分清敌友。不能认为只要是当权派，就一概不相信。不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的。那些真正贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的领导干部，是“三结合”的重要因素，我们要紧密地和他们结合在一起，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺他们的权，罢他们的官。只有实行“三结合”，才能保证夺到真正的实权，才能保证政权的巩固。
    上海许多工厂、学校和机关的革命造反组织对黑龙江省夺权斗争基本经验和《人民日报》社论，进行了认真的学习和讨论。他们认为，在当前全国展开全面夺权斗争的关键时刻，这两个文件的发表又一次传来了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的声音，这是对革命造反派最大的支持和鼓舞。许多革命造反组织回顾了自己的斗争实践说，“三位一体，联合夺权”，是黑龙江省夺权斗争基本经验的核心。上海的夺权斗争实践也证明，没有“三结合”，不实行“三位一体，联合夺权”，就不能取得夺权斗争的胜利，即使夺了权，也不能真正掌权。现在有些人，对干部不作具体分析，见当权派就乱轰一气，这是完全错误的，是违反毛主席思想的。一些革命造反团体的负责人还表示，黑龙江夺权斗争的基本经验是一个真正体现了毛泽东思想的重要文件，它闪耀着伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉。我们一定要很好地向黑龙江省红色造反者战友学习，在斗争中运用这些经验，为取得夺权斗争的彻底胜利而奋斗。
    天津市革命造反派的战士们极其兴奋地说，黑龙江省红色造反者创造的真正体现毛泽东思想的新经验，必将在天津在全国开花结果。中共天津市委机关革命造反派联合总部的一些革命造反派干部在座谈中一致指出，黑龙江的四条经验，非常重要，非常适时，对我们当前正在进行的夺权斗争，提供了一个极好的范例。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同各兄弟革命造反派组织大联合，团结革命的领导干部，同人民解放军的主要负责人，“三位一体，联合夺权”，把天津市的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。中国人民解放军驻天津某部的战士们听了广播以后，怀着激动的心情，在毛主席像前宣誓：“我们一定读您的书，听您的话，做您的好战士，按照您的教导，坚决支持革命造反派，同革命造反派战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的经验传到山西，已经掌握山西省党政机关大权的革命造反派战士，都感到特别亲切。山西革命造反总指挥部的革命群众组织的代表杨成效说，这个经验是革命造反派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争的“法宝”，也是革命造反派掌好印把子的“法宝”。我们山西革命造反总指挥部，就是在夺权斗争中形成的“三位一体，联合夺权”的权力机构。我们革命造反派联合了省市党政机关内执行毛主席正确路线的主要负责人刘格平、刘贯一、袁振等革命领导干部和山西军区第二政委张日清同志，并主动提出让他们参加总指挥部的核心领导，对山西革命造反派夺权和掌权起了重要作用。夺权以后，他们又和我们一起，总结群众斗争的经验，逐步健全了组织，把更多的革命群众团结在总指挥部的周围，把大权牢牢地掌握在革命造反派手里。杨成效还谈到山西军区第二政委张日清同志和解放军广大指战员同革命造反派在生死与共的战斗中所结下的革命友谊，认为山西取得夺权胜利，也象黑龙江一样，是和解放军的积极支持分不开的。山西革命造反兵团的革命小将们在座谈黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的经验时强调说，在夺权斗争中，必须不折不扣地贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席所制定的干部政策。不分青红皂白，凡是当权派，就一脚踢开，统统打倒，这是盲动主义，是形“左”实右，是完全违背毛泽东思想的。
    贵州省贵阳地区无产阶级革命造反派广大革命战士表示，要反复地认真地学习黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验，指导自己的行动。毛泽东思想贵州省革命委员会主任委员、中国人民解放军贵州军区副政委李再含同志说：没有无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，就没有夺权斗争的胜利。而这种大联合又必须以革命群众组织的负责人、当地驻军的负责人和党政机关的革命领导干部的“三结合”为核心。否则，夺了权也掌不牢，巩固不住。在夺权中，一定要坚持实行“三结合”，充分信任本单位的革命干部。革命干部，是党的宝贵财富。对于干部，必须严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，采取区别对待的方针。对于犯有错误的干部，要切切实实按照“惩前毖后、治病救人”的党的传统政策办事。不能怀疑一切，打倒一切，一概加以排斥。这样，才有利于不断壮大左派队伍，团结多数，取得夺权斗争的胜利。毛泽东思想贵阳战斗团总部的同志说：在夺权斗争中，我们革命造反者一定要以毛泽东思想作为行动的最高准则，加强团结，巩固战斗友谊，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。
    山东省济南、青岛两市的广大革命造反派，热情赞扬黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验，为当前无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权树立了一个活样板。青岛市革命领导干部王效禹同志联系青岛的夺权斗争谈到：正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，是当前夺权斗争中特别值得注意的重要问题。对于当权派，我们一定要区别对待。对于那些犯有错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就应当采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，争取他们，教育他们，这是毛主席的一贯政策，这是我们的责任。山东革命工人造反总指挥部的同志们说，我们在夺权斗争中，也深深体会到，要夺取政权、巩固政权，必须团结省委内执行毛主席正确路线的领导干部，做到“三位一体，联合夺权”。对领导干部要进行阶级分析，坚决执行毛主席正确路线的，我们就要团结他们，尊重他们，拥护他们。我们反对那种把一切领导干部一棍子打倒的错误做法。我们革命工人最能识别干部、爱护干部，贯彻毛主席制定的干部政策。我们要和那些破坏毛主席干部政策的坏人作坚决的斗争。济南军区负责同志说，我们全体指战员要虚心学习黑龙江夺权斗争的样板经验，把他们活学活用毛主席著作的经验运用到山东夺权斗争中来。在复杂的阶级斗争中，我们坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决支持左派夺权，坚决镇压阶级敌人反夺权的一切反革命活动。
    哈尔滨市广大革命群众从广播里听到《人民日报》社论《无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的一个好范例》以后，激动地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们说，这是毛主席、党中央对我们黑龙江省红色造反者又一次最大支持，最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们绝不辜负他老人家的期望，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。哈尔滨军事工程学院的红色造反者们激动地说，黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的许多经验，归根结底就是一条：老老实实地按照毛主席的教导办事。这个经验的取得，完全归功于我们伟大的领袖毛主席。
