The Chinese photo exhibition opened in Hanoi on the afternoon of the 7th. The exhibition was organized by the Vietnam External Cultural Liaison Committee and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association according to the cultural cooperation plan between the two countries.

The exhibition features photographs in three categories: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, agriculture, and industry in China.

The photo exhibition was warmly welcomed by the military and civilians of Hanoi. The exhibition hall was filled with soldiers, workers, students, and officials.

The photographs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China attracted the most viewers. They carefully observed each photo, and many gathered in front of the photo of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao receiving the Red Guards, reluctant to leave. Vietnamese soldier Nguyen Dinh Thi told the reporter: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a great revolution, and we firmly support it."

The audience enthusiastically praised the great achievements in socialist construction under the leadership of Chairman Mao. A student from the Comprehensive University told the reporter: "China's development is so rapid and so strong, which is also a support for our Vietnamese people's struggle against the Americans to save the country."

Relevant officials from various sectors of Vietnam, as well as the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, Lu Weizhao, and diplomatic staff from the embassy attended the opening ceremony. (Photo attached)
