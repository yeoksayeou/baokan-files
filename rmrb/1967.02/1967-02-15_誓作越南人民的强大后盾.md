Today is the sixth anniversary of the unification of the heroic liberation armed forces of South Vietnam. As a member of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I express my deepest respect and my warmest congratulations to my brave comrades on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

The liberation armed forces of South Vietnam are a heroic army that was born, grew, and became strong in the struggle. Over the past six years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, this army has demonstrated the mighty power of people's war, fighting bravely and shedding blood to defeat the American imperialists and their lackeys, leaving them in a state of chaos and disarray. The heroic struggle and brilliant victories of the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and have greatly dampened the arrogance of American imperialism.

However, as Chairman Mao said: "To create disorder, to fail, to create disorder again, to fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." American imperialism is the kind that won't stop until it sees the coffin. Although it has suffered a crushing defeat, it is still sending more troops to South Vietnam, while savagely bombing North Vietnam and ruthlessly pursuing its "war to force peace" and "bombing to force negotiations" conspiracies. The Soviet revisionist leadership is also running around, serving the American imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy. But no matter how American imperialism and its accomplices try, they will meet a bad end.

Facing the ferocious American imperialists, the people and liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have fought bravely and achieved great victories. Of course, their struggle is still arduous.

Chairman Mao said: "Both the reactionary forces and we have difficulties. But the difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces approaching death and without a future. Our difficulties are surmountable because we are new forces with a bright future."

This is indeed the case. The Chinese people have had personal experience. We clearly remember that in the fifth year of our War of Resistance Against Japan, in 1942, the Japanese imperialist invaders, on the one hand, imposed an economic blockade on our base areas, and on the other hand, concentrated all their forces to launch a frenzied mopping-up campaign, implementing the so-called "iron wall encirclement" tactics and brutally carrying out the "three-all" policy of burning, killing, and looting. At that time, from the surface, the difficulties the enemy inflicted on us were very severe: no grain, no cloth, few guns and ammunition. But these difficulties did not frighten us. At that time, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out wisely: "Although our future is still arduous, the dawn of victory is already visible. Defeating Japanese fascism is not only certain but also not far off." We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, persisted in fighting, and when there was no food to eat, we filled our stomachs with wild vegetables; when there was no cloth to wear, we spun and wove our own; when there were no guns and ammunition, we seized them from the enemy. Finally, in 1945, we achieved a brilliant victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

History tells us: when the enemy is at its most frenzied, it is also on the brink of its end; and when we are at our most difficult, it is also when victory is about to come. Currently, American imperialism in South Vietnam is making its last struggles, appearing ferocious and ruthless on the surface, but in fact, this shows its weakness. The people and liberation army of South Vietnam are fighting stronger and stronger, achieving a great situation. The people of South Vietnam are fearless of violence, unafraid of sacrifice, and determined to drive the American aggressors out and win the final victory. They have set a brilliant example for the liberation struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world.

China and Vietnam, mountains connected to mountains, waters connected to waters; the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, hearts connected, shoulders side by side. We, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. Seven hundred million Chinese people pledge to be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will win, and American imperialism will be defeated!

### 誓作越南人民的强大后盾

    誓作越南人民的强大后盾
    今天，是英雄的越南南方解放武装力量统一日六周年。我作为中国人民解放军的一个成员，怀着无限崇敬的心情，向正在反美斗争最前线的英勇战友们，表示最热烈的节日祝贺。
    越南南方解放武装力量，是一支在斗争中诞生、成长、壮大的英雄部队。六年来，这支部队在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，发挥了人民战争的强大威力，浴血奋战，把美帝国主义及其走狗，打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。越南南方解放武装力量的英勇斗争和辉煌胜利，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义的威风。
    但是，正如毛主席所说的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义是不见棺材不落泪的。尽管它已经遭到了惨败，但它还在大举增兵南越，同时野蛮地轰炸越南北方，穷凶极恶地推行“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。苏修领导集团也到处奔跑，为美帝的“和谈”阴谋效劳。可是，不管美帝国主义也好，它的帮凶也好，都不会有好下场。
    面对凶恶的美帝国主义，越南南方人民和解放武装力量英勇奋战，取得了伟大的胜利。当然，他们的斗争仍然是艰巨的。
    毛主席说：“反动势力面前和我们面前都有困难。但是反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”
    事实正是这样。中国人民曾经有过亲身的经历。我们清楚地记得，在我国抗日战争的第五个年头，即一九四二年，那时日本帝国主义侵略者对我根据地一面实行经济封锁，一面集中全力进行疯狂的扫荡，实行了所谓“铁壁合围”战术，野蛮地实行了烧光、杀光、抢光“三光政策”。当时，从表面上看，敌人给我们造成的困难是十分严重的，没有粮，没有布，枪差弹少。但是，这些困难并没有吓住我们。当时，我们的伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“我们的前途虽然还有艰苦，但是胜利的曙光已经看得见了。战胜日本法西斯不但是确定的，而且是不远的了。”我们遵循毛主席的教导，坚持战斗下去，没有粮食吃，就用野菜充饥；没有布穿，就自己纺线织布；没有枪支弹药，就从敌人手里夺，终于在一九四五年取得了抗日战争的光辉胜利。
    历史经验告诉我们：当敌人最疯狂的时候，也就是敌人的末日即将到来的时候；而当我们最困难的时候，也就是胜利即将到来的时候。当前美帝国主义在越南南方正在作垂死的挣扎，表面上看来张牙舞爪，穷凶极恶，实际上恰恰表明它的虚弱。而越南南方人民和解放军越战越强，打出了一片大好形势。南越人民不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，决心把美国强盗赶出去，夺取最后的胜利。他们为全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    中越两国，山连山，水连水；中越两国人民，心连心，肩并肩。我们中国人民和中国人民解放军，最坚决地支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。七亿中国人民誓作越南人民的强大的后盾。我们坚定地相信，越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败！
