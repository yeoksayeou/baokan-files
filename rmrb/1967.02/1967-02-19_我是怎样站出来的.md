The basic experiences of the Red Guards' struggle for power in Heilongjiang Province are excellent! They are indeed excellent! This is the result of their active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! The Red Guards in Heilongjiang Province have set an example and provided valuable experiences for our great alliance and struggle for power among the revolutionary masses. We must learn from them.

I was the former First Secretary of the Xinxian Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province. For over a decade, I was deceived and persecuted by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Shanxi Provincial Committee. As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, these people feared that I would expose their heinous crimes of forming factions, surrendering, and opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. In desperation, they sought every opportunity to frame me with false charges such as "dissatisfaction with the Party" and "counter-revolutionary," removed me from my post, and attempted to kill me.

In the life-and-death struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line, in the decisive battle between the revolutionary masses of Shanxi for the seizure of power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Xinxian Prefecture Committee, could I remain silent any longer? No! A thousand times no! A million times no! I am a revolutionary soldier of Chairman Mao. Only by following Chairman Mao's words can I have the courage and strength to fight; only by acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can I see the direction of the struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation is constantly changing. To make our thoughts adapt to the new situation, we must learn." Therefore, I studied the "Three Articles," "Against Liberalism," and Chairman Mao's related works such as "On the Chongqing Negotiations" with these questions in mind. From these brilliant works, I understood that in a class society, if one does not stand on the side of the revolution, one will inevitably side with the enemy; there is no middle ground. In the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what should I do? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Therefore, in the intense class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I must resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, stand up, and defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death.

"The great unity of the people," this is the earnest teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao. The people are the creators of world history. We revolutionary cadres must revolutionize by always following Chairman Mao's words, distinguishing between friends and enemies, and firmly uniting with the revolutionary rebels and the People's Liberation Army to break through all the enemy's fortresses and seize power back into the hands of the revolutionary masses. Therefore, on February 3, I announced: I will rebel! I will resolutely stand with the revolutionary rebels, rebel against the capitalist-roaders in power, thoroughly expose and settle accounts with the heinous crimes of this counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and completely overthrow them. After my "Declaration of Rebellion" was posted, it immediately received enthusiastic support from the revolutionary rebels, the Xinxian Military Sub-district, and the local troops. Thus, we united with the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary rebels, fought through numerous difficulties, finally broke through the numerous obstacles of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Xinxian Prefecture Party Committee, completely destroyed the counter-revolutionary stronghold, and enabled the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers in Xinxian Prefecture to seize power and hold power.

I appeal: Revolutionary cadres, stand up! As long as you firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the side of the revolutionary rebels, you will receive the welcome and support of the revolutionary rebels and the People's Liberation Army. Revolutionary cadres, only by uniting with the revolutionary rebels and the People's Liberation Army can you seize power from the capitalist-roaders in power and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我是怎样站出来的
    原山西省忻县地委第一书记　徐志远
    《黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验》好得很！就是好得很！这是他们活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！黑龙江省红色造反者给我们无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的斗争做出了榜样，提供了宝贵的斗争经验，我们要向他们学习。
    我是原中共忻县地委第一书记，十几年来，我受到了山西省委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的蒙蔽和迫害。无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开始，这一小撮人生怕我起来揭发他们结党营私，招降纳叛，反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。他们狗急跳墙，处处寻找借口，给我加上了诸如“对党不满”、“反党分子”等种种莫须有的罪名，撤了我的职，企图置我于死地。
    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的生死搏斗中，在山西无产阶级革命派大联合，夺山西省委内和忻县地委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权的决战中，我还能再沉默下去吗？不能！一千个不能！！一万个不能！！！我是毛主席的革命战士，只有听毛主席的话，才有斗争的勇气和力量；只有照毛主席的指示办事，才能认清斗争的大方向。
    毛主席教导我们说：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”于是，我就带着这些问题学习
  “老三篇”，学习《反对自由主义》和《关于重庆谈判》等毛主席的有关著作。从这些光辉著作中，我懂得了在阶级社会中，每一个人不站在革命的一边，就必然倒向敌人的一边，中间道路是没有的。在无产阶级和资产阶级进行你死我活的大搏斗中，我该怎么办呢？毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”所以，在无产阶级文化大革命激烈的阶级斗争中，我要坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面，挺身而出，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想。
    “民众的大联合”，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们的谆谆教导。人民群众是创造世界历史的动力，我们革命领导干部，要革命就要永远听毛主席的话，分清敌、友、我，坚决地和革命造反派、人民解放军联合在一起，才能冲破敌人的一切堡垒，把政权夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。于是，在二月三日我宣布：我要造反了！我要坚决和革命造反派站在一起，造走资本主义道路的当权派的反，彻底揭发和清算这一伙反革命修正主义集团的滔天罪行，彻底把他们打倒。当《我的造反声明》贴出后，立即受到了革命造反派、忻县军分区和当地驻军的热烈支持。于是，我们便和人民解放军、革命造反派联合在一起，经过艰苦斗争，终于冲破了忻县地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的重重阻力，彻底摧毁了反革命营垒，使忻县地区无产阶级和广大劳动人民夺了权，掌了权。
    我呼吁：要革命的领导干部，站出来吧！只要是坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在革命造反派一边，就会受到革命造反派和人民解放军的欢迎和支持。革命的领导干部，只有和革命造反派、人民解放军大联合，才能从走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺回权，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
