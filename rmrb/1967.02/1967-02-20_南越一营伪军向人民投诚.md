A camp of puppet troops stationed in the Xa Lien area of New Yen County, Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, refused to continue serving as tools for the American aggressors to slaughter their own people. On January 3, they defected from the puppet army and surrendered to the people.

This patriotic action by the puppet troops caused great panic among the American puppet authorities. They hastily dispatched troops to pursue them. However, with the help of the local people, most of these defectors have already reached the liberated areas.

    南越一营伪军向人民投诚
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：驻在越南南方边和省新渊县孝廉地区的一个伪军别动营的官兵，不愿继续充当美国侵略强盗屠杀自己同胞的工具，于一月三日脱离伪军向人民投诚。
    这批伪军官兵的爱国行动，使美伪当局十分惊慌，它们慌忙出动军队前去追击。但是在当地人民的帮助下，这批弃暗投明的伪军大部分已经到达解放区。
