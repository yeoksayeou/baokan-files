The red flag waves over Fuzhou City, and the victory song echoes throughout China. At this moment, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of comprehensive class struggle, news of another victory in smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line has come from the front lines of Fujian's coastal defense.

We enthusiastically hail the new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

We warmly praise the genuine proletarian revolutionaries on the front lines of Fujian for their new contributions in defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

We sincerely congratulate the three services of the front lines in Fujian for their new merits in defending the proletarian dictatorship!

At this critical moment when the proletarian revolutionaries across the country are implementing the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" advocated by the great leader Chairman Mao, forming great alliances, and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, at this moment when the entire army is enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call and resolutely supporting the revolutionary leftists with actual actions, at this moment when the front-line troops are on high alert and strengthening their combat readiness, a handful of power-holders within the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fuzhou Municipal Committee who are taking the capitalist road have colluded with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society to stir up a counter-revolutionary tide. They desperately oppose the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" and power seizure, openly directing the spearhead of struggle against the genuine proletarian revolutionaries and the great People's Liberation Army. They attempt to sabotage the powerful tool of proletarian dictatorship, aiming to retain the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers they have usurped and maintain their shaky counter-revolutionary rule.

At this critical moment of power seizure, the class enemies direct the spearhead of struggle against the People's Liberation Army. This is by no means accidental. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." The great People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the storms of class struggle, is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship and the firm backing for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The victories in Shanghai, Shanxi, Qingdao, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Fujian have once again proven this great truth. The class enemies have always seen the People's Liberation Army, which is loyal to Chairman Mao, as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat, fearing it to death and hating it to the core. In order to save their doomed fate, they will inevitably play all sorts of tricks and plot conspiracies, making desperate struggles. They either disguise themselves as "leftists" to deceive the army into supporting them and suppressing the genuine revolutionary masses, or they distort right and wrong, spread rumors, and incite the deceived masses to viciously attack the People's Liberation Army, or they spread anarchist thoughts, deceiving and inciting some people to reject everything, oppose everything, and overthrow everything, directing the spearhead of struggle against the genuine proletarian revolutionaries and the People's Liberation Army. All these tricks are aimed at sabotaging the powerful tool of proletarian dictatorship, sabotaging the correct policy of "three-in-one combination," and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals. This is indeed a foolish dream of a tiny insect shaking a big tree. They will only meet their doom!

"Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The class enemies directing the spearhead of struggle against the People's Liberation Army fully shows that Chairman Mao's great call to resolutely support the revolutionary leftists is extremely wise and correct! It fully shows that our resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions and full support for the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries are correct and good! We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely unite with the genuine proletarian revolutionaries, fight with them, and achieve victory with them.

The acute and complex class struggle before us is a stern test for every soldier. We must resolutely support the genuine proletarian revolutionaries, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary tide, and definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, conduct thorough investigations and research among the masses, use Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and microscope to see through everything, distinguish right from wrong, identify true from false, and clarify enemies and friends. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. For the handful of reactionary ringleaders, we must resolutely suppress them without mercy. For those who have been deceived, we must do a great deal of political and ideological work to educate and win them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like Xiang Yu." The broad ranks of our army must resolutely follow the great instructions of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution, promote combat readiness, heighten vigilance, firmly guard the combat posts, and be ready at any time to smash the conspiracies and sabotage activities of domestic and foreign class enemies. We must thoroughly defeat the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and in the struggle to defend national defense, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, make new contributions and establish new merits.

    彻底粉碎反革命逆流
    红旗漫卷福州市，凯歌响彻全中国。在无产阶级文化大革命进入全面阶级斗争新阶段的今天，又一次粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的胜利消息，从福建海防前线传来了。
    我们热情欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利！
    我们热烈赞扬福建前线真正的无产阶级革命派，为保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线做出的新贡献！
    我们衷心祝贺福建前线三军指战员，为保卫无产阶级专政建立的新功勋！
    正当全国无产阶级革命派贯彻伟大领袖毛主席的“三结合”的正确方针，实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，正当全军指战员热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，以实际行动坚决支持革命左派的时刻，正当前线三军百倍警惕、加强战备的时刻，福建省委和福州市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结社会上的地富反坏右，掀起一股反革命逆流，拚命反对“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针，公然把斗争矛头指向真正的无产阶级革命派，指向伟大的人民解放军，妄图破坏无产阶级专政的强大工具，以达到保住他们所篡夺的党、政、财、文大权，维持摇摇欲坠的反革命统治。
    在夺权斗争的关键时刻，阶级敌人把斗争矛头指向人民解放军，这绝不是偶然的。毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的，在阶级斗争风暴中经过千锤百炼的强大人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是保证无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的坚强后盾。上海、山西、青岛、贵州、黑龙江和福建等地区的胜利，再一次证明了这个伟大的真理。阶级敌人对于忠于毛主席的人民军队，向来是看成眼中钉，肉中刺，怕得要死，恨得要命。它们为了挽救即将灭亡的命运，必然要耍尽花招、玩弄阴谋，作垂死的挣扎。它们或者是乔装打扮成“左派”，以骗取军队的支持，镇压真正的革命群众；或者是颠倒是非，造谣惑众，挑动受蒙蔽的群众恶毒攻击人民解放军；或者是散布无政府主义思想，欺骗和煽动一些人，去排斥一切，反对一切，打倒一切，把斗争矛头指向真正的无产阶级革命派，指向人民解放军。凡此种种伎俩，都是为了破坏无产阶级专政的强大工具，破坏“三结合”的正确方针，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，以达到他们反革命的目的。这真是蚍蜉撼大树，痴心梦想。它们得到的只能是灭亡！
    “被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。阶级敌人把斗争矛头指向人民解放军，正说明毛主席坚决支持革命左派的伟大号召，非常英明！非常正确！正说明我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，全力支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，做得对！做得好！我们要坚决地按照毛主席这个教导去做，坚决地和真正的无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    摆在我们面前的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，对每个指战员都是严峻的考验。我们要做到坚决支持真正的无产阶级革命派，彻底粉碎反革命逆流，一定要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，深入群众调查研究，用毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜，洞察一切，明辨是非，区别真伪，分清敌我，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。对那一小撮反动的首恶分子，要坚决镇压，绝不留情。对那些受蒙骗的群众，要大力做好政治思想工作，教育和争取他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我军广大指战员要坚决遵循最高统帅毛主席的伟大指示，抓革命，促战备，百倍提高警惕，严守战斗岗位，随时准备粉碎国内外阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，彻底打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，在保卫国防、保卫无产阶级专政、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中做出新的贡献，建立新的功勋。
