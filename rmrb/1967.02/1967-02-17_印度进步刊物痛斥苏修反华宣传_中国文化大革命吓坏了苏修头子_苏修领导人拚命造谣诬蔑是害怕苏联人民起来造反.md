Indian progressive publication *The People's Path* in its February issue published an article that severely condemns and refutes the Soviet revisionist leadership's slander and defamation against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and exposes other anti-China crimes committed by the Soviet revisionists.

The article, titled "Revisionists Attack Revolutionary China," points out that the recent Cultural Revolution in China has once again provided an opportunity for the world's people to distinguish between the correct path of Marxism-Leninism and the revisionist path advocated by the Soviet revisionist leaders. "The more mature the revolutionary situation in China becomes, the more these notorious figures will engage in slander and defamation. The revolutionary achievements and economic and technological successes of China have made them tremble with fear. Together with the imperialists, they oppose and denounce China. They are afraid that the people of the Soviet Union and other countries will compare their own situations with China's. This is the reason why these people are so eager to denigrate China's achievements and defame the tried-and-true leadership of the Chinese revolution."

The article points out that the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong has made some discredited figures among the Soviet revisionists look extremely pathetic. Therefore, the two news agencies of the Soviet Union, Tass and Novosti, have issued a large number of fabricated news about the Cultural Revolution in China. The mouthpieces of the Soviet revisionist leaders, such as *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, and *Literaturnaya Gazeta*, have also been engaged in anti-China propaganda.

The article states that every true revolutionary must remember that China is engaged in the most resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have provided various forms of assistance to the people of Vietnam, who are on the front lines of the anti-U.S. struggle. The Chinese people "persist in the revolutionary anti-imperialist line, exposing the conspiracy of the Soviet leaders to collude with the United States. The Soviet leaders and their lackeys are afraid of being exposed before the masses, so they have launched even more absurd attacks on the Chinese leaders."

In discussing the bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionists' so-called "peaceful coexistence" fallacy, the article points out: Revolutionaries, the proletariat, and the oppressed people of the world, as well as socialist countries, cannot coexist with imperialism, aggression, and exploitation. Revolutionaries and the working class, as well as the laboring masses, have no other choice. They must struggle and ultimately defeat the aggressors and their running dogs.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leaders want to follow the already bankrupt path of the Second International. The world's working class and revolutionaries, who are engaged in fierce struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, will not be led astray by these opportunist leaders. The leaders of the Second International insisted on attacking the Bolshevik Party and Lenin, who adhered to correct revolutionary principles. Modern revisionists are now attacking the Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

    印度进步刊物痛斥苏修反华宣传
    中国文化大革命吓坏了苏修头子
    苏修领导人拚命造谣诬蔑是害怕苏联人民起来造反
    据新华社十五日讯新德里消息：印度进步刊物《人民之路》二月号刊登一篇文章，严正谴责和驳斥苏联修正主义领导集团对伟大的中国文化大革命的造谣诬蔑，并且揭露苏修的其它反华罪行。
    这篇题为《修正主义攻击革命的中国》的文章指出，最近在中国开展的文化大革命，又向世界人民提供了机会，来辨别什么是正确的马克思列宁主义的斗争道路，什么是苏联修正主义领导人等鼓吹的修正主义道路。“中国的革命形势愈是成熟，这些声名狼藉的头面人物就愈要进行诬蔑和诽谤。中国的革命成就以及经济和技术成就使他们怕得要命，他们同帝国主义者一道反对和指责中国。”他们害怕苏联和其他国家的人民拿自己国家的情况同中国的形势作对比。“这就是这些家伙竭力诋毁中国的成就和诬蔑中国革命的久经考验和得到信任的领导的原因。”
    文章指出，毛泽东主席领导的文化大革命，使苏修等一些声誉扫地的头面人物狼狈不堪。因此，苏联两家通讯社塔斯社和苏联新闻社发出了大量关于中国文化大革命的完全是捏造的消息，《真理报》、《消息报》、《文学报》等苏联修正主义领导人的喉舌也大肆进行反华宣传。
    文章说，每一个真正的革命者一定记得，中国在从事最坚决的反对美帝国主义的斗争。中国人民给予了站在反美斗争前线的越南人民各种援助。中国人民“坚持革命的反帝路线，揭露了苏联领导人从事苏美勾结的阴谋。苏联领导人及其仆从害怕在群众面前被揭露，于是他们对中国领导人发动了更加荒谬绝伦的攻击。”
    文章在谈到苏联修正主义者的所谓“和平共处”的谬论的破产时指出：一切革命者、无产阶级和全世界被剥削人民以及社会主义国家不能同帝国主义、侵略和剥削共处。革命者和工人阶级以及劳苦群众都没有别的选择。他们必须进行斗争，最后打败侵略者及其走狗。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义领导人等要走第二国际的已经破产的道路。正在同美帝国主义者及其走狗进行激烈斗争的世界工人阶级和革命者，是决不会被这些机会主义领导人引入歧途的。第二国际的领导硬要攻击坚持正确革命原则的布尔什维克党和列宁。现代修正主义者正在攻击中国共产党，攻击中国共产党的领袖毛泽东同志。
