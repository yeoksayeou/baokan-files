	Mao's Quotations

	The situation is constantly changing. To make one's thoughts adapt to new situations, one must learn. Even those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism and have a firm proletarian standpoint still need to continue learning, to accept new things, and to study new problems.
		From "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China"

    毛主席语录
    情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。即使是对于马克思主义已经了解得比较多的人，无产阶级立场比较坚定的人，也还是要再学习，要接受新事物，要研究新问题。
                   《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》
