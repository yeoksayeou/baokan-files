The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) "Vanguard" Calls for Active Study and Application of the "Three Articles"

Read, Read Again; Study, Study Again; Apply, Apply Again

Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne - The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ "Vanguard" published Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" on February 2nd, along with an editorial note. The note calls on the Australian people to "read, read again; study, study again; apply, apply again" this brilliant work.

The editorial note states: "In Memory of Norman Bethune" is one of the "Three Articles" written by Chairman Mao Zedong. "We demand that everyone read, read again; study, study again; apply, apply again these articles. Only then can you, through your own experience, understand the power of Mao Zedong Thought. In every aspect of our lives and work, these three articles are extremely valuable. You must make them your own."

While publishing Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," the "Vanguard" also reprinted a recent Chinese commentary on this article titled "The 'Three Articles' Are the Revolutionary's Motto."

    阅读再阅读　学习再学习　运用再运用
    新华社墨尔本电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》二日刊登了毛泽东主席在一九四四年九月发表的《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作，并加了编者按，号召澳大利亚人民“阅读，再阅读；学习，再学习；运用，再运用”这篇光辉著作。
    编者按说：《为人民服务》是毛泽东主席所写的“老三篇”中的一篇，“我们要求人人阅读，再阅读；学习，再学习；运用，再运用这几篇文章。然后你才能通过自己的体会懂得毛泽东思想的威力。在我们生活和工作的各个方面，这三篇文章是非常有价值的。要把它们变成你自己的东西。”
    《先锋报》在刊登毛主席的《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作的同时，还转载了中国最近发表的关于这篇文章的评论《“老三篇”是革命者的座右铭》一文。
