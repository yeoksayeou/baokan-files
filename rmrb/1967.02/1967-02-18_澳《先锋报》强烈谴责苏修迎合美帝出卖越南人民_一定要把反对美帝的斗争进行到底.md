The Australian "Pioneer" strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist leaders' collusion with U.S. imperialism in betraying the Vietnamese people. We must carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

The article points out: U.S. imperialism, with the cooperation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, is playing tricks with peace talks to blackmail the Vietnamese people. Whenever someone suggests lowering the conditions proposed by the Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism raises its demands and becomes even more arrogant. Proposing that the U.S. unconditionally stop bombing and military actions as a precondition for talks will not solve the Vietnamese problem. Only the unconditional withdrawal of all U.S. troops truly serves the interests of the Vietnamese people. The recent frenzied anti-China campaign launched by the Soviet revisionist leadership is directly related to China's firm opposition to the betrayal of Vietnam.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Melbourne on the 16th, the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ "Pioneer" published an article on the first page on the 16th, exposing the new "peace talks" trick played by U.S. imperialism in the Vietnamese issue, and strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism, betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people, and their frenzied anti-China treacherous acts.

The article titled "We Must Carry On the Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism to the End" first discussed the current favorable situation of the world people's anti-imperialist struggle. The article said that the people of the world revolution are engaged in a great struggle against imperialism led by the United States.

The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is the current focus of the world's struggle against U.S. imperialism. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has greatly inspired the oppressed peoples and is proving the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger.

The article then pointed out that U.S. imperialism, suffering defeats in the Vietnam War, is playing tricks with "peace talks" with the cooperation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, blackmailing the Vietnamese people.

The article said: "U.S. imperialism is in urgent need of a breathing space in Vietnam, so it throws out one fake peace plan after another, and each time it is accompanied by intensified warfare." "They are trying to obtain at the negotiating table what they cannot get on the battlefield. They are already in a desperate situation on the battlefield." "Whenever someone suggests lowering the conditions proposed by the Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism raises its demands and becomes even more arrogant."

The article emphasized that "proposing that the U.S. unconditionally stop bombing and military actions as a precondition for talks will not solve the Vietnamese problem." "Only the unconditional withdrawal of all U.S. troops truly serves the interests of the Vietnamese people." The article pointed out that the way to deal with U.S. imperialism is only one: to persist in struggle and defeat it. Peace will not be handed over. Only through struggle can peace be won.

The article then severely condemned the new crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership and their old and new followers in intensifying the betrayal of the Vietnamese people, pointing out that they are vigorously advocating so-called "joint actions" to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S., with the sole purpose of shamelessly betraying Vietnam.

The article emphasized that the recent frenzied anti-China campaign launched by the Soviet revisionist leadership is related to the Chinese people's firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and opposition to the Soviet revisionists' betrayal activities. The article said: The anti-China actions of the Soviet leaders have reached an unprecedented level. They attacked and injured Chinese students. They broke into the Chinese Embassy in Moscow. This is directly related to China's firm opposition to the betrayal of Vietnam. The Soviet revisionists are desperately trying to serve their American masters on the Vietnamese issue. This is the current focus of the revisionists' betrayal activities. The Chinese people are loyal comrades-in-arms of the Vietnamese people. "At present, there is actually an anti-China alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union."

The article said: The Soviet revisionists are helping U.S. imperialism in every way. They are fabricating unprecedentedly despicable lies and slanders against China.

The article pointed out, "Anyone with a clear mind will not unite with a thoroughgoing traitor, no matter how beautifully the traitor speaks." "In the current situation, whoever gives any help to the Soviet revisionist traitors and their despicable plots will eventually become a traitor."

    澳《先锋报》强烈谴责苏修迎合美帝出卖越南人民
    一定要把反对美帝的斗争进行到底
    文章指出：美帝正在苏修领导集团配合下玩弄和谈阴谋，对越南人民进行讹诈。——每当有人暗示降低越南人民提出的条件时，美帝就抬高要价，更加骄横起来。——提出由美国无条件停止轰炸和战争行动作为谈判的先决条件，是解决不了越南问题的。只有美军无条件全部撤走，才真正符合越南人民的利益。——苏修领导集团最近疯狂掀起反华浪潮，是同中国坚决反对出卖越南直接有关的。
    据新华社墨尔本十六日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》十六日在头版刊登一篇文章，揭露美帝国主义在越南问题上玩弄新的“和谈”骗局，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团迎合美帝国主义需要，出卖越南人民利益和疯狂反华的叛徒行径。
    这篇题为《一定要把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底》的文章，首先谈到了当前世界人民反帝斗争的大好形势。文章说，世界革命人民正在同以美国为首的帝国主义进行大搏斗。
    越南人民的抗美救国斗争是当前全世界反对美帝国主义斗争的焦点。越南人民的斗争大大鼓舞了被压迫人民，并且正在证明毛主席关于美帝国主义是纸老虎这一英明论断的正确性。
    文章接着指出，在越南战争中惨遭失败的美帝国主义，正在苏联修正主义领导集团的配合下，玩弄“和谈”阴谋，对越南人民进行讹诈。
    文章说：“美帝国主义迫不及待地需要在越南有一个喘息的时间，因此才抛出一个接一个的假和平计划，而且每次总伴随着加紧战争”。“他们是企图在会议桌上得到他们在战场上得不到的东西。他们在战场上已经陷入绝境。”“每当有人暗示降低越南人民提出的条件时，美帝国主义就抬高要价，更加骄横起来。”
    文章强调指出，“提出由美国无条件停止轰炸和战争行动作为谈判的先决条件，是解决不了越南问题的。”“只有美军无条件全部撤走，才真正符合越南人民的利益。”文章指出，对付美帝国主义的办法只有一个，那就是坚持不懈地进行斗争，把它打倒。和平决不会送上门来。必须经过斗争才能赢得和平。
    文章接着严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团及其新旧追随者加紧出卖越南人民的新罪行，指出他们大肆鼓吹所谓援越抗美的“联合行动”，其目的无非是无耻地出卖越南。
    文章强调指出，苏修领导集团最近疯狂掀起反华浪潮，是同中国人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，反对苏修的叛卖活动有联系的。文章说：苏联领导人的反华行动已经达到了史无前例的地步。他们袭击和打伤中国留学生。他们闯进了中国驻莫斯科大使馆。这是同中国坚决反对出卖越南直接有关的。苏联修正主义者在越南问题上正拚命设法为其美国主子效劳。这是当前修正主义者叛卖活动的焦点。中国人民是越南人民的忠实战友。“目前，实际上存在着美苏反华同盟。”
    文章说：苏联修正主义者正在各方面帮美帝国主义的忙。他们制造空前卑鄙的谎话和谰言来反对中国。
    文章指出，“任何头脑清醒的人都不会去同一个彻头彻尾的叛徒联合，不管这个叛徒的话说得多么漂亮。”“在当前形势下，谁要是对苏修叛徒及其卑鄙阴谋给予任何帮助，谁到头来也就会变成叛徒。”
