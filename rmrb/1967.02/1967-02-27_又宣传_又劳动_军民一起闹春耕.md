A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Huailai County, Hebei Province, listened to the broadcast of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes" on the morning of the 22nd. They were greatly inspired and immediately transcribed it word for word, printed it as leaflets, and distributed it to various propaganda teams engaged in propaganda activities in the area, widely disseminating the content.

After reading the letter, the broad masses of soldiers and officers unanimously agreed that this is the greatest concern and call to action from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, rural cadres, and all laboring people; it is also a new mobilization order for the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers and officers of the Ninth Company, who were recently rated as a "Four Good" company, said: "We have been in the countryside for a short time, and the letter from the Party Central Committee timely points out the direction for us. We must respond to Chairman Mao's call and carry out propaganda activities to grasp the revolution and promote production even better." The propaganda teams immediately broadcast this letter repeatedly over the wired broadcast and wrote it out in big-character posters and blackboard newspapers. Propaganda teams working with the community members labored while reading this letter to the rural cadres and community members. After work, the various propaganda teams studied together with the cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and community members of the production teams they were in. An old peasant, Tian Shike, said: "Chairman Mao has spoken the words in our hearts. Now is the time for spring plowing, and we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, unite as one, and work together to grasp the revolution and promote production, striving for victory in spring plowing production." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dayuanzhuang Brigade of Dayuanzhuang People's Commune, who had an average yield of over 400 jin per mu last year, said: "After our brigade underwent the Four Cleanups, under the leadership of the new leadership cadre, we doubled our grain production last year through a thorough cultural revolution and vigorous promotion of production, surpassing the 1965 harvest by more than one fold, and for the first time turning a grain-deficient brigade into a surplus grain brigade. For the vast majority of cadres, we trust them, and we firmly support their leadership. For cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are willing to correct them and take on responsibilities, we will unite with them to strive for an even greater harvest this year."

    又宣传　又劳动　军民一起闹春耕
    解放军驻河北省怀来县某团，在二十二日早晨从广播中收听到《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以后，万分振奋，当即一字一句地记录下来，印成传单，派人散发到正在驻地进行宣传活动的各个宣传队，广泛进行宣传。
    广大指战员读了信以后，一致认为，这是毛主席、党中央对广大贫下中农、农村工作干部和一切劳动群众的最大关怀和伟大号召；也是对我们人民解放军发出的新的动员令。最近刚被评为四好连队的九连指战员说：“我们来农村不久，党中央的信及时给我们指明了方向，我们一定要响应毛主席的号召，把抓革命促生产的宣传活动搞得更好。”宣传队马上把这封信在有线广播上进行反复广播，用大字报、黑板报写出去。和社员一块劳动的各个宣传小组，一面劳动，一面向农村干部、社员念这封信。收工回来，各宣传组还和所在生产队的干部、贫下中农、社员群众一块学习。一位贫农老大爷田世凯说：“毛主席说出了我们贫下中农心里要说的话。现在正是春耕的时候，我们一定要听毛主席的话，团结一条心，拧成一股绳，抓革命促生产，争取春耕生产的胜利。”去年，平均亩产获得四百多斤的大黄庄公社大黄庄大队的贫下中农说：“我们队四清之后，在新的领导班子的带领下，去年通过大抓文化革命，狠促生产，粮食产量超过了一九六五年收成的一倍以上，第一次变缺粮队为余粮队。对绝大多数干部，我们是信任的，我们坚决支持他们的领导。对犯过错误的干部，只要他们肯改正，并把担子挑起来，我们就要同他们团结起来争取今年更大的丰收。”　　　　　（解放军某部政治处）
