    The Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization of Sudan, Mirgani Nasri, issued a statement on the 19th, expressing support for the decision made at the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Winneba to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year.

    The statement said, "After this historic decision has been made, any attempt to prevent the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference from being held in China is harmful to the solidarity of Asia and Africa in opposing world imperialism.

    新华社喀土穆二十日电　苏丹亚非团结组织秘书长米尔加尼·纳斯里十九日发表声明，支持温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议。
    声明说，在这个具有历史意义的决定作出以后，任何不在中国举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的企图，对亚非团结反对世界帝国主义是有害的。“这对我们这个地区的解放事业，特别是对得到亚非人民全力支持的巴勒斯坦事业也是有害的。”
