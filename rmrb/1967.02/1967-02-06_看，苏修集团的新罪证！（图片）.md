This is the news photo exhibition window set up within the territory of the Chinese Embassy, displaying photographs of our great leader Chairman Mao and pictures introducing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, as well as photographs of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's bloody suppression of our students in Europe on January 25. The Soviet revisionist leaders are terrified and hate to the core the six news photo exhibition windows of our embassy.

Top left: On February 3, the Soviet revisionist clique sent plainclothes agents and thugs to smash the news photo exhibition windows of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union. The picture shows the remaining half of the window supports after being sawed.

Bottom left: The Soviet revisionist leaders, fearing exposure, sneakily sent thugs back to the scene at four in the morning, attempting to saw off the remaining half of the window supports and destroy the evidence. Photographed by Xinhua News Agency reporter.
