Macao compatriots held a celebration meeting on February 3 to commemorate the victory in the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle. A telegram of congratulations to Chairman Mao was adopted at the meeting. The full text is as follows:

Most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

With hearts filled with boundless excitement, we, the people of Macao, report to you—the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman—that our anti-imperialist patriotic struggle in Macao has won a great victory! This victory is a result of your loving care and wise leadership. Now, no words can express our infinite gratitude and profound respect for you. We can only shout a thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" and wish you, dear Chairman, eternal life and good health! Eternal life and good health!

At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland is entering a new stage, and when the people of Macao are launching a mass movement to study the works of Chairman Mao, the Portuguese imperialists, acting as a pawn in the anti-China scheme concocted by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, dared to stir up an anti-China wind and ignite an anti-China fire at the southern gate of our great socialist motherland. They attempted to test the strength of the Chinese people and to sabotage our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To this, we—the people of Macao armed with Mao Zedong Thought—say a thousand times no and ten thousand times no. We united and fought back, determined to defend the legitimate rights of the people of Macao, to defend the dignity of our socialist motherland, and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland. In this serious international class struggle, with you—the great helmsman of the world revolution—we fear nothing. No matter what monsters and demons come our way, we will defeat them and trample them underfoot!

In the struggle, together with the people of our motherland, we defeated the enemy's repeated attacks, exposed the enemy's one plot after another, navigated past one reef after another, and won victory after victory. Your brilliant thoughts are our powerful weapon to defeat the enemy and the fundamental guarantee of our victory.

At the most critical, most complex, and most acute moment of our struggle, the people of the entire nation stood up to support us, the mighty People's Liberation Army stood up to support us, and the heroic Red Guards stood up to support us. These voices from our motherland embodied your loving care and boundless encouragement for us, providing an unstoppable force to help us defeat the enemy and win victory.

Under your wise leadership, with the support of our powerful motherland, and with the brave and tenacious struggle of all the people of Macao, the Portuguese imperialists finally bowed their heads and admitted their crimes. Our anti-imperialist patriotic struggle has won a great victory. However, we, the people of Macao, will always remember your teachings, maintain high political vigilance, and be on guard against the enemy's desperate counterattacks. Although we have won a victory in our struggle against Portuguese imperialism, imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries still exist in this world. We firmly respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao: read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will steadfastly guard the southern gate of our motherland, always ready to tighten the noose around the necks of imperialism at your command, ensuring that they never rise again. We will forever be loyal to our great socialist motherland, forever loyal to the great Communist Party of China, and forever loyal to you, dear Chairman. We will unite with the people of the entire nation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and march forward bravely!

Most beloved and respected Leader Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts. On this joyous day when all the people of Macao celebrate the victory in the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle, let us, from the bottom of our hearts, wish you, dear Chairman, eternal life and good health! Eternal life and good health!

    澳门各界同胞庆祝反对澳葡迫害斗争胜利大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社香港四日电　澳门同胞在三日举行的庆祝反帝爱国斗争胜利大会上，通过了给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们澳门同胞怀着无比激动的心情，向您——伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手报喜：我们澳门同胞的反帝爱国斗争胜利了！这胜利，来自您的亲切关怀和英明领导，现在，千言万语都不能表达我们对您的无限感激和崇高敬意，我们只有千万遍高呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”千万遍恭祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    在祖国无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新阶段的时候，在澳门同胞掀起一个学习毛主席著作的群众运动的时候，澳葡帝国主义竟充当美帝、苏修所拼凑的反华逆流的“烂头卒”，胆敢在我们伟大的社会主义祖国的南大门，煽起一股“反华”之风，点起一把“反华”之火，企图试探中国人民的力量，妄想破坏我国无产阶级文化大革命。对此，我们——用毛泽东思想武装起来的澳门同胞是千万个不答应，万万个不答应。于是，我们团结起来，进行斗争，誓死保卫澳门同胞的正当权益，保卫社会主义祖国的尊严，保卫祖国的无产阶级文化大革命。在这场严重的国际阶级斗争中，有了您——世界革命的伟大舵手，我们什么也不怕，不论什么妖魔鬼怪，都可以把它打倒在地，再踩上一脚！
      在斗争中，我们和祖国人民一道，击败了敌人一回又一回的进攻，揭露了敌人一个又一个的阴谋，绕过了一处又一处的暗礁，夺取了一次又一次的胜利。您的光辉思想是我们战胜敌人的强大武器，也是我们取得胜利的根本保证。
    在我们的斗争最尖锐、最复杂、最关键的时刻，全国人民起来支持我们，强大的人民解放军起来支持我们，英雄的红卫兵小将起来支持我们，这些来自祖国的最强音，体现了您对我们的亲切关怀和无限鼓舞，这是一股威力无比的支持我们压倒敌人、夺取胜利的力量。
    在您的英明领导下，在强大祖国的支持下，在全澳同胞勇敢顽强的斗争下，澳葡帝国主义终于低头认罪了，我们的反帝爱国斗争胜利了。但是，我们全澳同胞将时刻记住您的教导，保持高度的政治警惕性，严防敌人的疯狂反扑。我们虽然取得了对澳葡帝国主义斗争的胜利，但是，在这个世界上，帝国主义和现代修正主义以及一切反动派还没有消灭，我们坚决响应林彪副主席的号召：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们坚定地守望着祖国的南大门，随时准备好，只要您一声令下，我们就拉紧套在帝国主义脖子上的绞索，使他们永世不得翻身。我们永远忠于伟大的社会主义祖国，永远忠于伟大的中国共产党，永远忠于您老人家，我们和全国人民团结在一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋勇前进！
      最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。在这个全澳同胞欢庆反帝爱国斗争胜利的日子里，让我们最最衷心地恭祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
