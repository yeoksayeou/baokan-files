Title: On the Question of "Betrayal"

There is a machine factory in Nanjing. The Red Guards of this factory, like other "puppet organizations" controlled by a few scheming bad elements within the Party, are controlled by a small number of bad elements with ulterior motives. After one member of the Red Guards saw through this, he resolutely stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels. This revolutionary action was met with hatred from these bad elements, who slandered him as a "traitor."

Such slander is utterly absurd. You, the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, what "loyalty" do you have?

What is this so-called "loyalty" of yours? It is nothing but fiercely defending the capitalist-roaders in power, stubbornly executing the bourgeois reactionary line, and actively inciting the masses to fight against each other. That's all! Your so-called "loyalty" is, in a word, stubbornly adhering to the reactionary bourgeois stance and opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

If this is considered "loyalty," then the masses who have been deceived by you should indeed change it, should indeed betray it!

What is this so-called "betrayal" that you view as a grave crime? It is changing from the stance of the bourgeois reactionary line to the stance of the proletarian revolutionary line. This "change" is a revolutionary "change," a revolutionary action, and it is excellent!

Current facts prove that the majority of the deceived Red Guards can achieve this "change." Of course, achieving this "change" requires conditions: first, admitting mistakes, as some Red Guards in Shanghai's Second Pharmaceutical Factory have done, acknowledging errors and surrendering to the truth; second, turning against the enemy, that is, launching a counterattack and thoroughly exposing the crimes of the masterminds behind the scenes. In short, one must completely draw a clear line in thought, organization, and action with the "puppet organization" one has participated in, and truly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

This "change" is the trend of the times, and no one can stop it. Those stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line still want to block this "change" today. This is like using an arm to stop a car, and the only outcome will be being crushed into smithereens!

Chairman Mao has said: "Stubborn elements are actually stubborn but not firm. In the end, they will change, changing into a pile of filth despised by humanity." Listen, you stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line: quickly reform yourselves and surrender to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! If you continue to be stubborn and persist to the end, then in the end, you will only "change into a pile of filth despised by humanity."

    “变节”辨
    高红
    南京有一家机器厂。这个厂的赤卫队，同其他一些党内走资本主义道路当权派的“御用组织”一样，是受极少数别有用心的坏家伙所控制的。这个赤卫队里有个队员识破了这一点之后，就毅然决然地站到革命造反派这一边来。这个革命行动遭到这些坏家伙的仇视，他们把他诬蔑为“变节分子”。
    这种诬蔑实在荒唐，你们这些党内走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，竟然也有什么“节”么！
    你们大言不惭的所谓“节”，是什么东西？就是拚命地保走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，积极地挑动群众斗群众。如此而已，岂有他哉！你们的所谓“节”，一言以蔽之，就是顽固地坚持反动的资产阶级立场，和毛主席的革命路线相对抗。
    这样的“节”，如果也算“节”的话，那么受你们蒙蔽的群众就是要变掉它，就是要背叛它！
    你们视为大逆不道的所谓“变节”，又是怎么一回事呢？就是从资产阶级反动路线的立场上变到无产阶级革命路线的立场上来，这种“变”，是革命的“变”，是革命的行动，好得很！
    目前的事实证明，大多数受蒙蔽的赤卫队员，是可以实现这种“变”的。当然，实现这种“变”，也需要条件：第一是认错，就象上海第二制药厂的部分赤卫队员所做的那样，承认错误，向真理投降；第二是倒戈，就是要杀它一个回马枪，彻底揭发幕后指使人的罪行。总之，要和自己参加过的
  “御用组织”，在思想上、组织上和行动上彻底划清界限，真正站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线这一边来。
    这个“变”是大势所趋，是任何人也阻挡不住的。那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，至今还想阻挡这个“变”。这就好象螳臂挡车，只能落一个被碾得粉身碎骨的下场！
    毛主席说过：“顽固分子，实际上是顽而不固，顽到后来，就要变，变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。”坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子们听着：你们赶快革心洗面，向以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线缴械吧！倘若仍然执迷不悟，顽固到底，那么，顽到后来，你们就只能“变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆”。
