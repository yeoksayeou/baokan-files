Fuzhou proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly welcome the third batch of Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese who returned on the Guanghua ship.

The overseas Chinese, with shining golden Chairman Mao badges on their chests and red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red," "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," and "Father and Mother Are Dear, but Chairman Mao Is Dearer" as they joyfully participated in the rally.

The rally began with the solemn music of "The East Is Red." Representatives from the Fuzhou Municipal and Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committees for Welcoming and Receiving Indonesian Returning Difficulties, as well as representatives from the Fujian Provincial Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the Fujian Provincial Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the Fujian Provincial "August 29" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, and overseas Chinese proletarian revolutionaries, spoke at the meeting. They expressed heartfelt greetings to the returning overseas Chinese who remained loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the socialist motherland, who were unafraid of sacrifice, and who dared to fight against the Indonesian reactionaries. They warmly welcomed them to Fujian to participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They pointed out that Fujian is currently in a new high tide of the Cultural Revolution. After crushing the latest counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, the provincial proletarian revolutionaries have entered a new stage of great unity and seizure of power. The people of the entire province are responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and industrial and agricultural production is flourishing. The returning difficulties, who have returned victorious from the front lines of international class struggle, will surely be able to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in their new posts, fight shoulder to shoulder with the people of the entire province, build the great socialist motherland even stronger, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Zhang Dexue, a representative of the returning difficulties, spoke on behalf of all the returning difficulties, expressing heartfelt thanks for Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's boundless care and for the warm welcome from their compatriots in the motherland. He said, "We returning difficulties, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, with the support of seven hundred million compatriots in the motherland and the people of Indonesia, have resolutely decided not to fear sacrifice and have engaged in a decisive struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries. We have finally returned to the motherland, which is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought." He said, "We have returned to the motherland in the midst of the high tide of the Cultural Revolution. We will definitely stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, care about state affairs, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end."

Zhang Dexue also expressed that all the returning difficulties will definitely, in their new work and production posts, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They will definitely strive to revolutionize their own thinking and, together with the people of the entire country, build the great socialist motherland even more prosperous and strong.

The Little Red Guards who participated in today's welcome rally presented revolutionary treasures—Chairman Mao's works—to the overseas Chinese. The rally ended with the song "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman."

These more than one thousand Indonesian difficulties arrived in Fuzhou City this afternoon. They will leave here in a few days to settle in Donghutang Overseas Chinese Farm in Ningde County, participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

    新华社福州十七日电  福建省和福州市无产阶级革命派和革命群众今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎第三批乘光华轮回国的印度尼西亚受害华侨。
    侨胞们胸前佩着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手中挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，唱着《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》等革命歌曲，兴高采烈地参加了大会。
    大会在庄严的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。福建省、福州市无产阶级革命派欢迎和接待印尼归国难侨接待委员会负责人，以及福建省工人革命造反总司令部、福建省农民革命造反总司令部、福建省“八·二九”革命造反总司令部的代表和归侨无产阶级革命派的代表，在会上讲了话。他们向忠于毛泽东思想、忠于社会主义祖国，不怕牺牲、敢于同印尼反动派斗争的归国侨胞，表示亲切的慰问，并热烈欢迎他们前来福建参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。他们指出，当前福建正处在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，全省的无产阶级革命派在粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的又一次新反扑后，已经进入无产阶级革命派“三结合”大联合、大夺权的新阶段；全省人民响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，工农业生产也形势大好。从国际阶级斗争前线胜利归来的难侨们，在新的劳动岗位上，一定能够活学活用毛主席著作，和全省人民并肩战斗，把伟大的社会主义祖国建设得更富强，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    难侨代表张德华在讲话中代表全体难侨对毛主席、党中央无比亲切的关怀和祖国亲人的热烈欢迎表示衷心的感谢。他说，我们难侨遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在祖国七亿亲人和印尼人民的支持下，下定决心，不怕牺牲，同印尼反动派进行了针锋相对的坚决斗争，终于回到了祖国怀抱，这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。他说，我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中回到祖国，我们一定坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，一定牢记毛主席的教导，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    张德华还表示，全体难侨在新的工作、生产岗位上，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，响应林彪副主席的号召，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。一定要努力促进自己的思想革命化，和全国人民一道，把伟大的社会主义祖国建设得更繁荣富强。
    参加今天欢迎大会的红卫兵小将向侨胞们赠送了革命宝书毛主席著作。大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中结束。
    这一千多名印尼难侨是十六日下午到达福州市的。他们将在几天后离开这里去宁德县东湖塘华侨农场安家落户，参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
