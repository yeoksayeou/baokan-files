The selfless Communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, who sacrificed his life to rescue a special train for the Red Guards, has sparked a tremendous response from international friends. Recently, many foreign friends visiting Hangzhou, where Cai Yongxiang's former unit is located, enthusiastically praised the hero Cai Yongxiang as a good soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and a model for revolutionary people worldwide.

After hearing the introduction to Cai Yongxiang's life, many foreign friends said that Cai Yongxiang's dedication to the revolution and the people, his fearlessness in the face of danger, and his willingness to sacrifice himself are all results of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically sang the praises of Chairman Mao, of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and of the hero Cai Yongxiang. After visiting Cai Yongxiang's former unit, the delegation leader of the Albania-China Friendship Association, Comrade P. Dode, said: "We highly evaluate Cai Yongxiang's noble actions in defending the bridge, defending the people of the motherland, and defending the Red Guards, and we express our deepest respect. The heroic deeds are the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Cai Yongxiang is a good son of the Chinese people, a good soldier of Mao Zedong. Cai Yongxiang will be immortal!"

A Latin American friend said: "Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds are the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Cai Yongxiang's deeds are not only a good example for the Chinese people but also for revolutionary people worldwide. He made me further realize that a person armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have such heroic deeds. Cai Yongxiang's life was one of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a life of serving the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. He is not only a hero of the Chinese people but also a hero of the world's revolutionary people. To learn from Cai Yongxiang is to learn from him in studying Chairman Mao's works. Not only in words but also in actions, to thoroughly eliminate selfish thoughts."

A Malian friend, after hearing the introduction, said: Cai Yongxiang fought for his lofty ideals until his last breath. Cai Yongxiang's deeds prove: how much people need to deeply study Chairman Mao's works. Cai Yongxiang's example is a great encouragement to us in opposing imperialism and opposing old and new colonialism. A Romanian comrade repeatedly praised: "China has not just one hero like Cai Yongxiang; this is the power of Mao Zedong Thought. I am very moved, and I will definitely tell the Romanian people when I return home."

A Latin American friend said: Cai Yongxiang's revolutionary spirit shows that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary army and also an army that transforms people. I will introduce the hero's deeds to my country's people as a model for our revolutionary struggle. A Japanese friend said: "Cai Yongxiang is a highly respected hero, a great soldier of Mao Zedong, a great son of the Chinese people. Although he has died, you have several million soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and several million Red Guards. The cause of China will definitely be victorious."

An African friend, moved, said: "I love Cai Yongxiang, I love the PLA, I love the PLA's good political thoughts, I love the PLA's good spiritual appearance."

Foreign friends, at the martyr's former unit, saw groups of Red Guards from all over the country, carrying red flags, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with backpacks, wearing straw shoes, passing through the Qiantang River Bridge. With great passion, they mourned the hero here, made pledges, and swore to learn the hero's thoughts, walk the hero's path, and create heroic achievements with lofty aspirations.

    据新华社讯　一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥，为抢救一列红卫兵专车而英勇牺牲的光辉事迹，引起了国际友人的巨大反响。不久前，许多来我国访问的外国朋友，在杭州访问蔡永祥烈士生前所在连队时，热烈赞扬英雄蔡永祥是毛泽东思想武装起来的好战士，是全世界革命人民学习的榜样。
    许多外国朋友听了蔡永祥生前事迹介绍后，都说，蔡永祥一心为革命，一心为人民，临危不惧，勇于献身，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。他们热情地歌颂毛主席，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，歌颂英雄蔡永祥。阿尔巴尼亚中国友好协会代表团访问蔡永祥生前所在连队后，代表团团长彼·多德同志说：“我们高度评价蔡永祥为保卫大桥，保卫祖国人民，保卫红卫兵的崇高行动，并表示最大的尊敬。英雄的事迹，是中国共产党和毛主席英明领导的结果。蔡永祥是中国人民的好儿子，是毛泽东的好战士。蔡永祥永垂不朽！”一位拉丁美洲朋友说：“蔡永祥的英雄行为，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。蔡永祥的事迹不仅是中国人民，也是世界革命人民学习的好教材。他使我进一步认识到一个人用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能有这样的英雄行为。蔡永祥的一生，是活学活用毛主席著作的一生，是为中国革命和世界革命服务的一生。他不仅是中国人民的，也是世界革命人民的英雄。学习蔡永祥，就是要象他那样，学习毛主席著作。不仅在口头上，而且要表现在行动上，把私心杂念彻底铲除。”一位马里朋友听了介绍后说：蔡永祥为了崇高的理想，奋斗到生命的最后一分钟。蔡永祥的事迹证明：人们多么需要深入学习毛主席著作。蔡永祥的榜样，对我们反对帝国主义，反对新老殖民主义的国家，是一个巨大的鼓舞。一位罗马尼亚同志连连称赞说：“中国蔡永祥式的英雄不只一个，这都是毛泽东思想的威力，我内心很激动，回国后一定要告诉罗马尼亚人民。”
    一位拉丁美洲朋友说：蔡永祥的革命精神，说明了中国人民解放军是一支革命化的军队，也是改造人的军队。我要向我国人民介绍英雄的事迹，作为我们革命斗争学习的榜样。一位日本朋友说：“蔡永祥是很受人尊敬的英雄，是毛泽东的伟大战士，中国人民的伟大儿子，他虽然死了，但你们有几百万用毛泽东思想武装起来的解放军，有几千万红卫兵，中国的事业一定胜利。”
    一位非洲朋友激动地说：“我爱蔡永祥，我爱解放军，爱的是解放军政治思想好，爱的是解放军精神面貌好。”
    外国朋友在烈士生前连队，看到来自全国各地的一支支红卫兵长征队，扛着红旗，手拿《毛主席语录》，背着背包，穿着草鞋，经过钱塘江大桥，满怀激情在这里悼念英雄，表决心，立誓言，决心学英雄思想，走英雄道路，创英雄业绩的凌云壮志，极为感动。
