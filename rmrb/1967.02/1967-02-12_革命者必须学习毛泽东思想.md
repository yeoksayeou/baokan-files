Revolutionaries must study Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has great significance not only for China but for the entire world. This revolution was personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. However, I did not initially understand its significance. At first, when it was said that this Cultural Revolution would touch people's souls, I could not grasp its meaning immediately. But as the Cultural Revolution developed, I had some contact with friends, especially with the Red Guards, which helped me understand it better. This revolutionary movement does not allow for any compromise.

Now, more and more Japanese people are realizing that this movement is a fierce class struggle. They also feel that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, based on Mao Zedong Thought, is of great significance. They not only have full confidence that the Chinese people will achieve victory in this Cultural Revolution but also feel that progressive individuals, youth, students, and workers in Japan should study Mao Zedong Thought.

On the other hand, some people are very afraid of China's Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought. These are the reactionary forces in Japan. However, more and more Japanese people are beginning to study Mao Zedong Thought. Now, there are many organizations and institutions in Japan dedicated to studying Mao Zedong Thought. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao," this red book, has been printed and circulated in five different editions in Japan. The leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, who used to make money by selling these books, now forbid their sale. In Japan, those who have become revisionists and reactionaries are very afraid of this book, but people who love independence, progress, and revolution love this book and study it seriously.

Every morning when I wake up, I hear the broadcast of news about the Cultural Revolution and the majestic song of "The Internationale." This gives me a deep impression. This Cultural Revolution is of great significance not only to China but to all people around the world who are striving for independence, liberation, and revolution.

    革命者必须学习毛泽东思想
    日本  西园寺公一
    中国的文化大革命不但对中国，而且对全世界具有伟大意义。无产阶级文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的。但是开始的时候，我并不理解它的意义。最初说这次文化大革命要触及人们的灵魂，我也不能马上理解。但是文化大革命发展以后，我同一些朋友，特别是同红卫兵有了些接触，使我懂得了一些。这次革命运动，不容许有一点点妥协。
    现在，越来越多的日本人民了解到这次运动是一场激烈的阶级斗争。他们也感到伟大的无产阶级文化大革命是以毛泽东思想为基础的。他们不仅有充分信心认为中国人民一定会在这场文化大革命中取得胜利，而且日本的进步人士、青年、学生、工人也感到应该学习毛泽东思想。
    另外，也有一些人对中国的文化大革命，对毛泽东思想感到非常恐惧。他们是日本的反动势力。可是，越来越多的日本人民开始学习毛泽东思想。现在日本已经有许多学习毛泽东思想的机构和组织。《毛主席语录》这本红书，在日本已经印刷和发行了五种不同的版本。日共领导人过去一贯是以销售这种书籍来赚钱的，现在他们却禁止出售。在日本，变成修正主义的人和反动派对这本书非常惧怕，但是热爱独立、进步的人民和革命者却非常喜爱这本书，并且都在认真地学习这本书。
    每天清晨，我一起床就听到广播文化大革命的消息，也听到《国际歌》的雄壮歌声。这使我有很深的感受。这次文化大革命，不仅对中国，而且对全世界一切争取独立解放和要革命的人，都是具有重大意义的。
