Chairman Mao has pointed out, "The Soviet revisionist leading clique, the Yugoslav Tito clique, all kinds of traitors and scabs, ... they are nothing but a handful of dirt, ... they are the slaves and henchmen who kneel before imperialism."

The Soviet revisionist leading clique recently, on the one hand, has been madly anti-China, doing everything it can to worsen Sino-Soviet relations, and on the other hand, has been closely colluding with American imperialism, engaging in counter-revolutionary joint actions. Its traitorous face has been fully exposed.

After the Soviet revisionist leading clique instigated thugs to brutally beat up our students in front of Lenin's Mausoleum on January 25, on February 3, it sent 160-170 special agent thugs to break into the courtyard of our embassy in the Soviet Union, smashing and stealing the newsstand, and beating up our embassy's chargé d'affaires and diplomatic personnel. On February 4, 20-30 Soviet revisionist special agent thugs attacked the Chinese embassy four times and blocked Chinese nationals from attending the embassy's Spring Festival reception. Starting from February 6, every day large groups of thugs have been breaking into our embassy to cause trouble. On February 9, the Soviet revisionists unilaterally tore up the agreement between China and the Soviet Union on mutual visa exemption.

While committing these anti-China atrocities and destroying Sino-Soviet relations, the Soviet revisionists have become even more brazen in their betrayal of the cause, colluding with the American imperialists and doing evil deeds together.

On January 30, the Soviet revisionist leader Podgorny visited the Vatican and met with Pope Paul VI, who actively supports the American imperialists' "peace talks" plot in Vietnam. The two had a long discussion on the Vietnam issue.

The Pope of the Vatican is a representative of the most reactionary forces disguised as a religious figure. Since the founding of the Soviet Union, no leader has ever met with the Pope. Even Khrushchev only dared to send his son-in-law to make contact with the Pope. Now the Soviet revisionist leader openly colludes with the Pope, showing that the Soviet revisionists have completely joined forces with the most reactionary forces in the world.

Following this, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin visited Britain on February 6. In Britain, he publicly proposed a so-called "three-stage plan" to serve the American imperialists' "war for peace" and "bombing for peace" plots, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to give up their struggle. Kosygin also conspired with the British government to push for so-called nuclear non-proliferation and "easing" the European situation, to adapt to the needs of American imperialist aggression. The Soviet revisionists' treacherous behavior has greatly emboldened the American imperialists.

What is particularly outrageous is that Kosygin viciously attacked China and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in Britain. The Soviet revisionist leaders' shameless deeds fully prove that they are a bunch of counter-revolutionaries who are determined to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end.

The Soviet revisionists are so arrogant in their hostility towards the Chinese people and so shameless in their surrender to American imperialism that they will surely end up lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet, hastening their own doom.

### 苏修叛徒嘴脸大暴露

    苏修叛徒嘴脸大暴露
    毛主席指出，“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，……他们都不过是一抔黄土，……他们是跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙。”
    苏修领导集团最近一面疯狂反华，竭力恶化中苏关系，一面同美帝国主义加紧勾结，大搞反革命联合行动。它的叛徒嘴脸更加原形毕露。
    苏修领导集团在一月二十五日指使暴徒在列宁墓前野蛮殴打我国留学生后，二月三日，又派了一百六、七十名特务暴徒，闯进我国驻苏大使馆前院围栏内，砸坏并抢走了新闻橱窗，毒打我国驻苏大使馆临时代办和外交人员。二月四日，苏修特务暴徒二、三十人又四次袭击中国大使馆，并且阻拦华侨参加大使馆的春节招待会。从二月六日起，每天都有大批暴徒闯进我国大使馆进行捣乱。二月九日，苏修又片面撕毁了中苏两国互免签证的协议。
    苏修在接连制造反华暴行、破坏中苏两国关系的同时，更加明目张胆地投靠美帝，它同美帝狼狈为奸，大干坏事。
    一月三十日，苏修头子波德戈尔内访问梵蒂冈，会见了积极支持美帝的越南“和谈”阴谋的教皇保罗六世，两人就越南问题进行了长谈。
    梵蒂冈的教皇是披着宗教外衣的极端反动的势力的代表，苏联从建国以来，还没有一个领导人会见过教皇。
    就是赫鲁晓夫也只敢派他的女婿去给他同教皇勾搭。现在苏修头子竟然同教皇公开勾结，说明苏修已经完全同世界上最反动的势力同流合污了。
      接着，苏修头子柯西金在二月六日访问英国。他在英国公然提出替美帝的“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”阴谋效劳的所谓“三阶段计划”，企图迫使越南人民放弃斗争。柯西金还同英国政府策划搞所谓防止核扩散和“缓和”欧洲局势，来适应美帝侵略政策的需要。苏修这种叛卖行为，大大助长了美帝的疯狂气焰。
    特别令人愤慨的是，柯西金竟然在英国恶毒地攻击中国和中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席。苏修头子这种无耻的行径，完全证明他们是一小撮同中国人民为敌到底的反革命分子。
    苏修这样猖狂地敌视中国人民，这样无耻地向美帝屈膝投降，其结果必将搬起石头砸自己的脚，使它的灭亡来得更快。
