Sixteen revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanxi Province jointly issued an urgent call for thrift to make revolution. This call is timely! It is practical!

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us to "make revolution through thrift." Chairman Mao's instruction is extremely important and has special political significance at present.

After taking over party power, political power, financial power, and cultural power, the Shanxi proletarian revolutionaries have fully exercised proletarian revolutionary authority by issuing the urgent call for thrift to make revolution. They have actively responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao and highly carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat being masters of the country.

Whether to practice thrift or to indulge in waste is a fundamental contradiction between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. At present, it is an important aspect of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line.

After seizing power from the capitalist-roaders, we proletarian revolutionary rebels must seriously implement Chairman Mao's directive to "make revolution through thrift." Only by seriously implementing this directive can we thoroughly defeat the rampant counter-revolutionary economism; only by seriously implementing this directive can we guard against the enemy's sugar-coated bullets and consolidate the great power we have seized from the capitalist-roaders; only by seriously implementing this directive can we develop production and manage all undertakings well.

After taking over great power, we proletarian revolutionaries must resolutely oppose the big-boss mentality and the extravagant lifestyle within the revolutionary ranks. We must not let the old bosses go and then have new bosses come in! We must promptly expose and resolutely resist all practices that do not conform to the spirit of thrift to make revolution.

    节约闹革命
    山西省十六个革命造反组织联合发出了节约闹革命的紧急倡议，这个倡议提得好！提得及时！提得实在！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近指示我们“要节约闹革命”。毛主席的这个指示极为重要，在当前有着特别重要的政治意义。
    山西无产阶级革命派在掌握党权、政权、财权、文权之后，充分行使无产阶级的革命权威，发出了节约闹革命的紧急倡议。他们用实际行动，积极响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，高度发扬了无产阶级当家作主的革命精神。
    是勤俭节约还是铺张浪费，这是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的根本对立；在当前，是无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线大搏斗的一个重要方面。
    我们无产阶级革命造反派夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，更要认真执行毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的方针。只有认真执行这个方针，才能彻底击败反革命经济主义的猖狂反扑；只有认真执行这个方针，才能防止阶级敌人糖衣炮弹的袭击，巩固我们从走资本主义道路当权派手中夺来的大权；只有认真执行这个方针，才能发展生产，办好一切事业。
    我们无产阶级革命派掌握大权以后，在革命队伍内部，要坚决反对讲排场、摆阔气的大少爷作风，决不能走了老爷，又来了少爷！一切不符合节约闹革命精神的作法，我们都要及时揭露，坚决抵制。
