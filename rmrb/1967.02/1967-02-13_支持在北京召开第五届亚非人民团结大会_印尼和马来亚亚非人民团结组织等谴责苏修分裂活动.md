According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, Ibrahim Isa, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, sent a telegram to the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo on the 9th, strongly protesting and condemning the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys for plotting to hold a so-called Afro-Asian Solidarity Council in Cyprus.

The telegram pointed out that this meeting is entirely in the service of American imperialism and the sinister policies of the Soviet revisionists, aiming to split the solidarity movement of the Asian and African peoples.

The telegram also strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys for plotting to sabotage the resolution of the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference to hold the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing. The telegram stated, "We firmly support the resolution of the Fourth Conference and will make every effort to ensure the success of the Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, a news release from London: The Malayan People's Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee recently issued a statement condemning the Soviet revisionists' plot to conduct sabotage activities, exposing their intention to hold the "Eighth Council Meeting of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization" in Nicosia, Cyprus, as an attempt to illegally change the venue of the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference.

The Malayan People's Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee reiterated its complete support for holding the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year. It called on all anti-imperialist members of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization to firmly support this decision and reject participation in the modern revisionists' sabotage activities.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Dar es Salaam on the 11th, David Sibeko, the Chief Representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Dar es Salaam, issued a statement on the 11th saying: "The Pan-Africanist Congress firmly supports the legal resolution of the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Winnipeg to hold the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year."

The statement emphasized: "Those who fear revolution and are plotting to violate this legal procedure must be exposed and condemned, as they seek to split the Asian and African peoples and sabotage the people's anti-imperialist cause."
