The historical tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed a group of previously unknown pioneers within our ranks to the forefront of revolutionary organizations, making them prominent figures. In many units, the revolutionary faction has gained the upper hand, transforming from a suppressed, powerless position to one of power, achieving a reversal of fortunes.

This presents us with many new problems. How should the leaders of the revolutionary rebel faction treat the masses and mass movements? How should the masses of the revolutionary rebel organizations correctly treat their leaders? This is a major issue in strengthening and improving the leadership core and combat effectiveness of the revolutionary rebel faction.

On this issue, which touches the soul of each of us, we must not fall into blindness due to victory and lose self-awareness.

The struggle between the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has always revolved around the question of what stance and attitude to take towards the masses. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is to rely on the masses, trust the masses, and respect the masses' initiative, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves. It is to mobilize the masses to fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to fight against the ghosts and monsters in society, carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the masses are the true heroes. The leadership of the Party must come from the masses and return to the masses. Every comrade should understand that the creative power of the masses is boundless. We should trust the people, unite with them, and with full revolutionary enthusiasm, look downwards, and humbly learn from the masses. Whether or not we can do this is not a matter of work methods, but a fundamental issue of stance, attitude, and worldview.

There are many leaders of the revolutionary rebel faction who, in the course of struggle, have genuinely followed Chairman Mao's teachings. They were once "unknown soldiers" lacking in experience and work methods, but with a red heart and four volumes of Chairman Mao's works, once they took on leadership responsibilities, they worked diligently and tirelessly. They are bold revolutionaries who fear nothing, and they can humbly learn from the masses, listen to criticism, and summarize the masses' experiences. Therefore, they can overcome any difficulty and crush any enemy, rather than being crushed by them. They can continuously improve their ideological and combat levels in the struggle to transform the objective world.

There are also some leaders of the revolutionary rebel faction who, although they have worked hard for the masses, have not genuinely followed Chairman Mao's teachings in their actions. They are eager to be commanders standing above the masses, arrogant and self-satisfied, unwilling to do meticulous work among the masses, and truly mobilize the masses. They do not believe that the masses can liberate themselves and always want to issue orders and "mobilize the masses," making the masses follow their directives.

There are also some leaders who, when they were in the minority, could still maintain close ties with the masses and fight alongside them. However, after they became the majority, they gradually distanced themselves from the masses.

Every comrade in the revolutionary rebel faction should firmly believe in the truth that the masses are the true heroes. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the country, province, and city, and in every unit, through to the end, we do not rely on heaven or earth, nor on any "savior," but on our own liberation, guided by Mao Zedong Thought! For the proletarian revolutionary rebels, we should unconditionally accept the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. For anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we should resolutely resist.

"Ask the vast land, who controls the rise and fall? The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history."

We must overthrow servility. If the leadership of the revolutionary rebel faction implements the proletarian revolutionary line and acts according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will resolutely support them and actively carry out their directives. If they implement a wrong line, we will resolutely resist and rebel until they return to Chairman Mao's line, otherwise, we will resolutely remove or replace them. We are not the "preservationists," and we are not "Liu Bei," thinking that we cannot survive without some "Zhuge Liang." For the leaders of the revolutionary rebel faction at all levels, those who are revolutionary should stand with us, and those who are not revolutionary should step down from their leadership positions! As for those who have infiltrated the revolutionary rebel ranks for political opportunism, we should be vigilant and not let their two-faced tactics and evil plots succeed. Only those who are truly advanced revolutionary pioneers, in accordance with the principles of the Paris Commune, and chosen by the masses, have the right to lead us revolutionary rebels to advance victoriously!

The dialectics of history are ruthless. We must temper and transform ourselves in the great storms, examine and identify cadres, and cultivate a generation of steadfast and reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause in the fierce storms of mass struggle. Every comrade in the revolutionary rebel faction should take up the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, big connections, not only to bombard the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line but also to eliminate bourgeois ideology within our own ranks. Use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat to resolve the struggle between the two lines and two worldviews reflected within the revolutionary rebel faction, and correctly handle the relationship between leaders and the masses. We must not adopt the wrong attitude of covering up contradictions, concealing illnesses, and deceiving and compromising.

We, the revolutionary rebels, are the sworn enemies of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line. Our direction of struggle is always correct. "As long as we persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely prosper." It will forge an invincible proletarian revolutionary force. In this way, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be ensured.

    坚决依靠群众　将革命进行到底
    首都红卫兵第三司令部驻杭州联络站
    “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”无产阶级文化大革命的历史潮流，把我们队伍中一批本来不出名的闯将推到了革命组织的领导岗位，成为引人瞩目的人物。在不少单位，革命派已经取得了优势，革命造反派由原来受压制，无权的地位转变为有权的地位，得到了翻身。
    由此，许多新的问题摆到了我们的面前，革命造反派的领导人应当如何对待群众和群众运动？革命造反组织的群众如何正确对待自己的领导？这是当前加强和提高革命造反派的领导核心和斗争水平的一个重大问题。
    在这个触及到我们每个人的灵魂的问题上，决不可因为胜利而陷入盲目性，失去自觉性。
    无产阶级文化大革命中的两条路线的斗争，一直围绕着对待群众采取什么立场，采取什么态度的问题。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是依靠群众，信任群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己；放手发动群众去斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，放手让群众斗争社会上的牛鬼蛇神，进行斗、批、改。
    毛主席教导我们，群众是真正的英雄。党的领导必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。应该使每一个同志懂得，人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，我们应当信任人民，和人民打成一片，以满腔的革命热情，眼睛向下，恭恭敬敬地向群众请教。能不能这样做，这不是一个工作方法问题，而是一个根本立场问题，根本态度问题，是一个世界观的问题。
    有许多革命造反派的领导人，他们坚持在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，是真正按照毛主席的教导去做的。他们过去是“无名小卒”，缺少斗争的经验和工作方法，但他们靠一颗红心，四卷雄文，一旦担负起领导的责任，就勤勤恳恳不辞艰辛地工作。他们既是“敢”字当头，无所畏惧的革命闯将，又能虚心向群众学习，善于听取群众批评，总结群众经验。因而任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒他们，而只会被他们所压倒。他们能够在改造客观世界的斗争中不断提高自己的思想水平和斗争水平。
    也有一些革命造反派的领导人，他们虽然辛辛苦苦为群众做了不少好事，但是没有很好在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，没有真正按照毛主席的教导办事。他们热心于当高踞在群众头上的指挥官，骄傲自大，故步自封，包办一切，而不愿意深入到群众中去，做艰苦细致的工作，真正把群众发动起来。他们不相信群众自己能够解放自己，总是想发号施令，“运动群众”，让群众按照自己的指挥棒去转。
    还有些领导人，在他们处于少数时，还能比较密切地联系群众，和群众战斗在一起，当他们由少数变为多数之后，却渐渐地脱离了群众。
    革命造反派的每一个同志，应当坚信群众是真正的英雄这个真理。要把全国全省全市的无产阶级文化大革命，把每一个单位的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不靠天，不靠地，不是靠那一个“救世主”，而是靠我们自己解放自己，靠毛泽东思想指引我们闹革命！对于无产阶级革命造反派来说，就应当无条件地接受以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导。对于一切不符合毛泽东思想的东西，应当坚决抵制。
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    我们要打倒奴隶主义。革命造反派的领导执行了无产阶级革命路线，按照党中央、毛主席的指示办事，我们就坚决拥护，积极去干。如果执行了错误的路线，我们就要坚决抵制，就要坚决起来造反，直到使他们回到毛主席的路线上来，否则就坚决撤换、改选他们。我们不是“保”字派，我们决不是“阿斗”，以为离开了哪个“诸葛亮”就活不下去了。对于各级造反派的领导人，革命的和我们站在一起，不革命的就应该让他们从领导岗位上走开！至于对那些混进革命造反队伍的政治投机分子，我们应该提高警惕，不要让他们的两面手法和恶毒阴谋得逞。只有那些真正先进的革命闯将，按照巴黎公社的原则，经过群众选择，才有资格带领我们革命造反派乘胜前进！
    长江后浪推前浪，世上后人超前人。历史的辩证法是无情的。
    我们就是要在大风大浪中锻炼自己，改造自己，考察干部，识别干部，在群众斗争的急风暴雨中造就出一代立场坚定的、可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。每一个革命造反派的同志都应该拿起大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的武器，不仅用来炮轰党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线，而且也应该清除我们自己队伍中的资产阶级思想。运用无产阶级专政下的大民主来解决反映在革命造反派内部的两条路线、两种世界观的斗争，正确处理领导和群众的关系。而绝不能采取讳疾忌医，掩盖矛盾，文过饰非，折衷调和的错误态度。
    我们革命造反派是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的死对头。我们的斗争大方向始终是正确的。“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”就会锻炼成一支攻无不克，战无不胜的无产阶级革命队伍。这样，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利就有了确实可靠的保证。
