Li Weidong's blood is boiling with rage, and his fury surges from his chest. The seven hundred million people raise their iron fists and shout:
"Stop! Do not allow the Soviet revisionist clique to continue their rampage." The once-proud socialist country of the Soviet Union has been ruined by you, and the glorious homeland of the October Revolution has been turned into a place of darkness and despair. Yesterday, the Chinese people came to pay their respects to Lenin's remains, their hearts filled with red passion and blood spilled on the Red Square in Moscow. Today, our embassy staff in the Soviet Union, to defend the dignity of our motherland, face the brutal acts of Soviet revisionist thugs with unyielding courage and tenacity! The snowmen on the streets of Moscow fear the sunlight, and the new tsars in the Kremlin fear the great thought of Mao Zedong. Your actions do not show your strength; your end is near, and your days are numbered! Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The Soviet people will surely sweep the Soviet revisionist clique into the trash. Every debt of blood owed to the Chinese people will be repaid in blood by the Soviet revisionist clique. A mantis cannot stop the rolling wheels, and dark clouds cannot obscure the sun shining brightly. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high around the globe!

    不许苏修逞疯狂
    李卫东浑身热血沸腾，怒火冲出胸膛，七亿人民举起铁拳高
  呼：
  “住手！不许苏修统
  治集团继续逞疯狂。”好端端的社会主义国
  家苏联，已被你们糟蹋得不象
  样，光荣的十月革命的故
  乡，已被你们搞得乌烟瘴
  气惨淡无光。昨天，中华儿女为瞻
  仰列宁遗容，心红志坚鲜血洒在莫
  斯科红场上，今天，我驻苏使馆人
  员为保卫祖国尊
  严，面对苏修暴徒兽行
  威武不屈勇敢顽
  强！莫斯科街头的雪人害
  怕阳光，克里姆林宫的新沙皇
  们害怕伟大的
  毛泽东思想，你们的所作所为并不
  表示你们强大，你们的末日将到，寿
  命不长！有压迫就有反抗，苏联人民一定会把苏
  修统治集团扫进垃
  圾箱；欠下中国人民的笔笔
  血债，一定要苏修统治集团
  用血来偿。螳臂挡不住滚滚向前
  的车轮，乌云遮不住光芒四射
  的太阳，毛泽东思想的伟大红
  旗，一定会在全球高高飘
  扬！
