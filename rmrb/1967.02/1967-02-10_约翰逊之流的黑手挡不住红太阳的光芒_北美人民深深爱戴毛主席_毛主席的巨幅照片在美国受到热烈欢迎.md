Johnson's clique cannot block the radiance of the red sun.
North American people deeply admire Chairman Mao.
Chairman Mao's giant portrait warmly welcomed in the United States.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in London, a British friend, David Kerr, who has lived in China for many years, recently said at a public gathering in London that during his visit to the United States and Canada, he deeply felt that the American and Canadian people love Chairman Mao and yearn for New China.

Kerr said that he visited a hospital in Montreal, Canada, where Norman Bethune once worked. He held a memorial meeting there and screened a film about Bethune's life. He also read to the attentive audience a passage from Chairman Mao's work "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Comrade Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and devotion to the people, as manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people... A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is already a man of noble character, of pure heart, of moral integrity and of the most lofty sentiments, a man who is of value to the people." Although the hospital authorities expressed dissatisfaction, many doctors and nurses came up to him and shook his hand warmly, thanking him for bringing Chairman Mao's voice.

In a college in California, USA, students, upon hearing that Kerr was going to give a report on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, spread the word and enthusiastically attended the lecture. Before the lecture began, the room was already packed, and many students had to stand outside to listen.

Kerr said at this public gathering that once, during a meeting in the United States, people were discussing the deeply ingrained phrase "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world." After a heated discussion, they unanimously agreed that the phrase "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world" is equally true for the American people.

Kerr said that in a bookstore in the United States, he found a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. He deliberately asked, "Is it selling?" The answer he received was, "Oh, it's selling very well!" When Kerr showed the giant portrait of Chairman Mao he brought back from the United States to the audience in London, the audience burst into prolonged applause.

Before the meeting ended, the person presiding over the meeting announced that the bookseller at the venue was selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The audience cheered, and after the meeting, everyone eagerly went to purchase it.

This public gathering unanimously passed a telegram to the Chinese people. The telegram said: "We hail the achievements of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. We believe that the Cultural Revolution will defend the achievements of the Chinese people and pave the way for faster progress in political, economic, and technological development, which is in the interest of all mankind."

    约翰逊之流的黑手挡不住红太阳的光芒
    北美人民深深爱戴毛主席
    毛主席的巨幅照片在美国受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社伦敦电　一位在中国居住多年的英国朋友戴维·柯鲁克最近在伦敦举行的一次公众集会上说，他在访问美国和加拿大时深深感到，美国人民和加拿大人民热爱毛主席，向往新中国。
    柯鲁克说，他访问了白求恩在加拿大蒙特利尔工作过的一家医院。他在那里举行了一个纪念会，放映了白求恩生平的电影片断。他还向全神贯注的观众朗读了毛主席的著作《纪念白求恩》中的一段语录：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。……一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”尽管医院当局对此表示不满，但是许多医生和护士走上去同他热烈握手，感谢他带来了毛主席的声音。
    在美国加利福尼亚州的一个学院里，学生们知道柯鲁克要作关于中国无产阶级文化大革命的报告后，奔走相告，踊跃到会听讲。在开讲前房间里就挤满了人，许多学生不得不站在外面听。
    柯鲁克在这一公众集会上说，有一次，他在美国参加了一个集会。会上，人们在谈论“毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳”这句深入人心的话。经过热烈讨论后，他们一致认为，“毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳”这句话对美国人民来说同样是千真万确的。
    柯鲁克说，在美国的一家书店里，他发现毛主席的巨幅照片，他故意问道：“有人买吗？”他得到的回答是：“哦！多得很！”当柯鲁克把他从美国带回伦敦的毛主席的巨幅照片给听众看时，听众发出了长时间的掌声。
    在集会结束以前，主持会议的人宣布，会场售书处出售《毛主席语录》，到会的人欢腾起来了，会后，大家踊跃前去购买。
    这个公众集会一致通过了发给中国人民的一份电报。电报说：“我们欢呼毛泽东主席领导下的中华人民共和国取得的成就。我们相信，文化大革命将保卫中国人民所取得的成就，并为在政治、经济和技术发展方面取得更迅速的进步开辟道路，这是符合全人类的利益的。”
