The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us organizing the people to overthrow them. All reactionary elements, if you do not strike them down, they will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; if the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear by itself.

    毛主席语录
    人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。
                    《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》
