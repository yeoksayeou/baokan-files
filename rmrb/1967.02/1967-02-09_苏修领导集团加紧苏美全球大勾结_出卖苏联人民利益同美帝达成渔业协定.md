The Soviet revisionist leadership is intensifying its global collusion with the U.S., selling out the interests of the Soviet people to reach a fisheries agreement with U.S. imperialism.

	BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) — Washington: The two countries have completed another small deal in their global collusion. According to a statement from the U.S. State Department on the 6th, representatives from the U.S. and Soviet governments reached an agreement after three weeks of negotiations in Washington on fisheries issues. This is another step by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in pursuing U.S.-Soviet cooperation and selling out the interests of the Soviet people.

	The agreement reached by the two sides includes two draft agreements. In these agreements, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has made numerous concessions to U.S. imperialism. One of the draft agreements stipulates that the Soviet side acknowledges the U.S. extending its fisheries jurisdiction to 12 miles off the U.S. Pacific coast. The Soviet side also agreed to take steps of "cooperation" with the U.S. to protect U.S. fishing vessels from "damage" by larger Soviet vessels operating in this area. The agreement also stipulates "cooperation" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in "scientific research" and "general procedures" to reduce conflicts between the two countries' fishing vessels.

	This agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was reached as Japan and the U.S. began negotiations on this dispute. The Japanese side believes that if foreign fishing vessels are not allowed to fish within 12 miles of the U.S. coast, Japanese fishermen fishing in the waters off the U.S. Pacific coast, Alaska, and the U.S. Trust Territory in the South Pacific would suffer significant losses.

	Another agreement extends the agreement allowing Soviet fishermen to catch crabs off the U.S. West Coast for two more years, but the catch volume will be significantly reduced. It is reported that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will also negotiate on fishing issues off the U.S. Atlantic coast in May.

    苏修领导集团加紧苏美全球大勾结
    出卖苏联人民利益同美帝达成渔业协定
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美苏两国在全球大勾结中又完成了一桩小交易。据美国国务院六日宣布，美国和苏联政府的代表在华盛顿就渔业问题进行三个星期的谈判之后，已经达成了协议。这是苏联修正主义统治集团追求苏美合作、出卖苏联人民利益的又一个步骤。
    美苏双方达成的协议包括两个协定草案。苏联修正主义统治集团在这些协定中对美帝国主义百般忍辱退让。其中一个协定草案规定，苏联方面承认美国把它的渔业管辖权延展到离美国太平洋海岸十二英里远的范围。苏联方面还同意采取同美国“合作”的步骤，以保护美国渔船不受到在这个区域内行驶的苏联较大船只的“损害”。这个协定还规定美苏两国渔业在“科学研究方面的合作”和减少两国渔船发生冲突的“一般手续”。
    苏美之间的这一协定，是在日本和美国之间正在就这个争端问题开始谈判的时候达成的。日本方面认为，如果离美国海岸十二英里的海域不准外国渔船捕鱼，那末，在美国太平洋海岸，阿拉斯加和南太平洋美国托管地海面捕鱼的日本渔民就要受到重大损失。
    另一项协定规定把苏联渔民在美国西海岸捕捉海蟹的协定延长两年，但捕捉量要大大减少。据报道，美苏还将在五月份就两国在美国的大西洋海岸捕鱼的问题进行谈判。
