Comrades of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire province:

Under the warm concern and support of Chairman Mao, the great red sun in our hearts, the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in our province's rural areas is getting better and better! However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, in order to sabotage the cultural revolution and agricultural production, have joined forces to incite some ignorant masses to direct their struggle at cadres who have made ordinary mistakes, causing the masses to fight among themselves and diverting the direction of the struggle. Meanwhile, they are spreading a black wind, using methods such as "dividing more and leaving less," "dividing everything and eating it all up," "giving more work points," and "issuing bonuses indiscriminately" to undermine the foundations of socialism and destroy collective ownership. They incite some members to leave their production posts, and under the guise of "linking up," they attempt to cause a reduction in production and settle accounts with us in the autumn. Can we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, stand idly by and watch these sabotage activities? No! Absolutely not! We must stand up and, together with revolutionary workers, students, and revolutionary cadres, resolutely fight against these reactionaries and prevent their plots from succeeding. The country is ours, the state is ours, and society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will?

In the proletarian cultural revolution unfolding in the countryside, we poor and lower-middle peasants must further advance our ideological revolutionization, thereby making our agricultural production even better and our people's communes and socialist construction even more outstanding. Whether or not we can improve agricultural production is also an important indicator of whether we are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." It is wrong to grasp only the revolution and ignore production, or to grasp only production and ignore the revolution; both are contrary to Chairman Mao's requirements for us. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen most to Chairman Mao's words and implement his directives most resolutely. We will definitely, while doing a good job in the cultural revolution, also do a good job in production, striving for a bumper harvest this year and completing the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. Now, the spring plowing season has begun. The success or failure of production affects the year's harvest, the construction of our country, the lives of urban and rural people, and the support for the people of brother countries. We must take immediate action, start working, fertilize, dry seeds, repair tools, and prepare the land to create all favorable conditions for spring plowing and sowing. We must strengthen the management of wheat fields. We, the upright poor and lower-middle peasants, are pioneers in the revolution and must be shock troops in production. Revolution, we will do! Production, we will grasp! We must launch a high tide of spring production and turn Chairman Mao's great call into our actual actions.

Revolutionary grassroots cadres must replace the word "fear" with "dare," break with selfishness and establish public spirit, resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, take responsibility in the current spring production struggle to seriously manage production arrangements, labor organization, and the lives of the members, and use actual actions to promote the great development of production.

Comrades of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire province: What is important? Reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words are the most important. What is great? Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest. In the current tumultuous proletarian cultural revolution and the life-and-death class struggle, what do we rely on to defeat the frenzied counterattacking class enemies? It is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary rebels, must, especially at this critical moment of the power seizure struggle and during the busy spring season, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and especially focus on the "use" aspect. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai and Xigou, love Chairman Mao's works the most and are determined to act according to his instructions. In the past, Chairman Mao led us to fight against tyrants and gain liberation. Today, we must even more respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and achieve a double victory in revolution and production. We will build the rural people's communes into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly over our land.

Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

With proletarian cultural revolutionary greetings,

Chen Yonggui, Secretary of the Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade, Dazhai People's Commune, Xiyang County
Li Shunda, Brigade Leader of Xigou Brigade, Xigou People's Commune, Pingshun County
February 6, 1967

    文化革命当闯将　春耕生产打先锋
    陈永贵、李顺达给山西省贫下中农社员的一封信
    全省贫下中农社员同志们：
    在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的亲切关怀和支持下，咱省农村的无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好！可是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的地、富、反、坏、右分子，为了破坏文化大革命，破坏农业生产，他们勾结起来，煽动一些不明真相的群众，把斗争矛头指向犯有一般缺点错误的干部身上，挑起群众斗群众，转移斗争的大方向，而他们却藏在幕后看热闹。与此同时，又大刮黑风，用“多分少留”，“分光吃净”，“多记工分”，“乱发补助”等办法，挖社会主义墙脚，破坏集体所有制。煽动一些社员离开生产岗位，他们还以外出“串连”为名，企图造成减产，秋后和我们算帐。对于他们的这些破坏行为，我们贫下中农能眼看着不管吗？不能！绝对不能！我们要站出来，和革命的工人、学生、革命的干部联合起来，对这些反动家伙作坚决的斗争，不让他们的阴谋得逞。天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？
    在农村开展的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们贫下中农要进一步搞好思想革命化，从而把农业生产搞得更好，把人民公社、社会主义建设搞得更出色。能不能搞好农业生产，也是我们是不是认真贯彻毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示的一个重要表现。只抓革命，不问生产，或只抓生产，不搞革命都是错误的，都是不符合毛主席对我们的要求的。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，执行毛主席指示最坚决，我们一定在搞好文化大革命的同时，把生产搞好，争取今年农业生产来一个大丰收，完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。现在，春耕大忙开始了。生产搞得好坏，关系到一年的收成，关系到我们国家的建设，关系到城乡人民的生活，关系到对兄弟国家人民的支援。我们要马上行动起来，立即动手，积肥，晒种，修理农具，整理土地，为春耕春播创造一切有利条件。加强麦田管理。我们顶天立地的贫下中农，在革命当中是闯将，在生产当中要当突击手。革命，我们干！生产，我们抓！我们要掀起一个春耕生产的高潮，把毛主席的伟大号召变成我们的实际行动。
    革命的基层干部要把“怕”字换成“敢”字，破私立公，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决和贫下中农一起，在当前的春耕生产斗争中，要负起责任，把生产安排、劳力组织、社员生活都认真地抓起来，以实际行动来推动生产的大发展。
    全省贫下中农社员同志们：这重要，那重要，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话最重要；这伟大，那伟大，毛泽东思想最伟大。在当前轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，在你死我活的阶级大搏斗中，我们靠什么去战胜疯狂反扑的阶级敌人？就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想！我们广大贫下中农，广大革命造反派，越是在这夺权斗争的关键时刻，在春耕大忙的季节里，越要活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫。我们大寨、西沟的贫下中农最最热爱毛主席著作，决心按照他老人家的指示去做。过去毛主席领导我们打恶霸、闹翻身，得到了解放，今天我们更要响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的号召，夺取革命和生产双丰收。把农村人民公社建设成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远飘扬在我们的土地上。
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！致以无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼
