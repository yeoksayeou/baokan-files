Chairman Mao is the Hope of the World's Revolutionary People
African Revolutionary People Say Mao Zedong Thought is the Beacon for Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Revisionist Struggle

New China News Agency, February 25th

African revolutionary people enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought. They say that Mao Zedong Thought is the most effective weapon for thorough anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and it is the beacon in their struggle.

A Ugandan progressive recently said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the most effective weapon for thoroughly opposing imperialism and modern revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought teaches the oppressed masses to take up arms and fight for liberation, while the revisionists want to undermine the revolutionary spirit of the people."

He emphasized: All true revolutionaries in Uganda, together with revolutionaries around the world, cheer for Chairman Mao's creative development of Marxism-Leninism. He said:

"Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism."

He pointed out that because Mao Zedong Thought represents the interests of the revolutionary people of the whole world, imperialists and all reactionaries hate the works of Chairman Mao.

He said, Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers gives boundless inspiration to those determined to carry the national democratic revolution to the end. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, who have given heavy blows to the American aggressors, proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion.

A Zambian friend recently wrote in a letter that Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts are the beacon. He expressed in the letter his determination to study Chairman Mao's works.

A Tunisian friend recently wrote in an article: Great Mao Zedong Thought will change the face of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is an inexhaustible source for the Chinese people and the people of all countries.

A young man from southern Africa recently told a New China News Agency correspondent in Cairo: "American imperialists and Soviet revisionists are launching an anti-China movement because they fear Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese revolution. But we revolutionary people of the world all place our hopes in Chairman Mao." He proudly said: "We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, so we are fearless and cannot be deceived. We will overcome all difficulties and win the victory of the revolutionary struggle."

The organ of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), *Combat*, recently published an article in a prominent position, using Chairman Mao's wise judgment that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing, to discuss the experience of the Congolese (Brazzaville) revolution. The article said: When the enemy viciously attacks us, it means that our revolutionary path is correct and we are advancing. On the contrary, if the enemy praises us, saying we are kind people, then we have taken the wrong path.

The article pointed out that the more the enemy hates and opposes us, the "stronger we will become until we annihilate the reactionaries."

At the Third Algerian International Trade Fair, the part of Mao Zedong's works exhibited in the Chinese Pavilion was the most popular. Every day, the reading room of Mao Zedong's works in the Chinese Pavilion was crowded with visitors, and the queue to buy Mao Zedong's works was endless, fully demonstrating the Algerian revolutionary people's boundless love for Chairman Mao and their boundless respect for Mao Zedong Thought. The photo shows three Algerian farmers who traveled from dozens of kilometers away to the Chinese Pavilion to happily read Chairman Mao's works.

    毛主席是世界革命人民的希望
    非洲革命人民说毛泽东思想是反帝反修斗争的指路明灯
    新华社二十五日讯  非洲革命人民热情赞扬毛泽东思想。他们说，毛泽东思想是彻底反帝反修的最有效武器，是他们斗争中的指路明灯。
    一位乌干达进步人士最近说：“毛泽东思想是彻底反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的最有效武器。毛泽东思想教导被压迫群众拿起武器为争取解放而战斗，而修正主义者却要瓦解人民的革命精神。”
    他强调指出：乌干达的所有真正革命者，同世界上其他革命者一起，欢呼毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。他说：
  “毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃的时代的马克思列宁主义。”
    他指出，因为毛泽东思想代表了全世界革命人民的利益，所以帝国主义者和一切反动派都仇恨毛主席的著作。
    他说，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，给那些决心把民族民主革命进行到底的人以无限鼓舞。英勇战斗的越南人民给予美国侵略者的沉重打击，证明了毛主席的这个论断的正确。
    一位赞比亚朋友在最近的一封信中说，毛主席的光辉思想是指路明灯。他在信中表示，要努力学习毛主席的著作。
    一位突尼斯朋友在最近写的一篇文章中说：伟大的毛泽东思想将改变世界的面貌。毛泽东思想是中国人民和世界各国人民取之不尽、用之不竭的源泉。
    一位从非洲南部来的青年最近对新华社驻开罗记者说：“美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者正在掀起一个反华运动，因为它们害怕毛泽东思想和中国革命。但是我们世界革命人民都把希望寄托在毛主席身上。”他自豪地说：“我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，因此是吓不倒、骗不了的。我们将克服一切困难，赢得革命斗争的胜利。”
    刚果（布）全国革命运动机关刊物《战斗报》最近以显著地位登载了一篇文章，用毛主席关于被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事的英明论断来论述刚果（布）革命斗争的经验。文章说：当敌人对我们进行恶毒攻击的时候，那就说明我们这条革命的道路是走对了，并且正在前进。相反，如果敌人赞扬我们，说我们是和蔼的人，那我们的路子就走错了。
    文章指出，敌人越仇视、越反对我们，那“我们就会越来越强大，直到消灭反动派。”

    在第三届阿尔及尔国际博览会上，中国馆展出毛主席著作的部分最受欢迎。每天，中国馆的毛主席著作阅览室里总是挤满了观众，购买毛主席著作的人群络绎不绝，充分表现了阿尔及利亚革命的人民对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限崇敬。图为从几十公里以外赶到中国馆的三位阿尔及利亚农民在喜读毛主席著作。
