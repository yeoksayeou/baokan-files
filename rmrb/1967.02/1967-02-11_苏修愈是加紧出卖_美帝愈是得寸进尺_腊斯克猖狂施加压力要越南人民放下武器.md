The more the Soviet revisionists sell out, the more the U.S. imperialists demand more. Lasker arrogantly pressures the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, Washington: At a time when the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is intensifying its collaboration with U.S. imperialism to plot new "peace talks" schemes on the Vietnam issue, U.S. Secretary of State Lasker on the 9th made a speech at a press conference, viciously advocating the policy of "using war to force peace" and "bombing to lure peace" to demand that the Vietnamese people surrender to the U.S. aggressors. This speech shows that the only way to deal with the unyielding U.S. imperialism is to fight it decisively and fiercely until it is thoroughly defeated.

Lasker's lengthy speech essentially boils down to pressuring the Vietnamese people, especially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to stop supporting the anti-American national liberation struggle in the South, otherwise the desperate U.S. imperialism will continue to bomb North Vietnam.

Lasker arrogantly demands that the Vietnamese people, who are victims of U.S. imperialist aggression, take "reciprocal actions" and "mutual actions" with the U.S. aggressors, saying that it is necessary to recognize the need for at least some reciprocal actions. In essence, he wants the Vietnamese people to sacrifice their anti-American national liberation cause and surrender to the United States. He uses gangster logic, saying that "it is impossible to stop the war by halting half of it ourselves." "If we stop bombing, what will the other side do... We need some kind of answer on this issue."

The facts are clear and simple: to solve the Vietnam problem, it is not a matter of the U.S. aggressors and the Vietnamese people, who are the victims of aggression, taking "mutual actions" and "reciprocal actions." Rather, it is for U.S. imperialism to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its aggression troops from South Vietnam. In this way, the Vietnamese people can solve their own problems, and peace can be restored. However, Lasker insists on the U.S. policy of aggression and war, saying that it is "obvious" that the U.S. should "roll out of South Vietnam," which further exposes his wolfish ambition to advocate "reciprocal actions."

Lasker emphasizes that the U.S. attitude on the Vietnam issue has not changed in its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. He said: "We are prepared to handle military issues as military issues, and we are prepared to discuss with the other side what military actions both sides can take and push this issue towards peace."

While wielding the big stick, the U.S. Secretary of State also advocates conducting "secret diplomacy" to promote the "peace talks" conspiracy. He advocates that "both sides conduct secret diplomatic activities to discuss peace and mutual steps to reduce violence." He said that the U.S. "has been using various means to invite and conduct such talks," and "all channels remain open."

Lasker's arrogance is the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique colluding with U.S.-British imperialism and reactionaries from various countries to intensify the conspiracy to sell out the Vietnamese people's anti-American national liberation struggle. To carry out this conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and its lackeys are engaged in intense activities. The current Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin, who is visiting Britain, is colluding with British Prime Minister Wilson to urge Johnson to carry out the "bombing to lure peace" conspiracy. At the same time, the Indian reactionaries and the Vatican Pope Paul VI, who recently held talks with another Soviet revisionist leader Podgorny, are also coming out to advocate turning the Lunar New Year "ceasefire" into an "indefinite ceasefire" to "open the way for negotiations." UN Secretary-General U Thant and U.S. Representative to the UN Goldberg will soon also travel to Southeast Asia to peddle the "peace talks" conspiracy.

In the chorus of calls for peace led by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, U.S. imperialism is becoming more demanding and raising its price. The U.S. Christian Science Monitor on February 7 pointed out that "the president and his advisers are taking a harder line," and "the White House in the current mood does not want to take the difficult path of retreat negotiations." The Washington Post editorial on February 8 said more bluntly: "Rumors of peace are sometimes actually another form of war," and the U.S. "must continue to prepare for war" to "press the other side to make commensurate concessions" with "military superiority."

    苏修愈是加紧出卖　美帝愈是得寸进尺
    腊斯克猖狂施加压力要越南人民放下武器
    据新华社十日讯　华盛顿消息：在苏联修正主义统治集团正在变本加厉地在越南问题上配合美帝国主义策划“和谈”新阴谋的时候，美国国务卿腊斯克九日在记者招待会上发表谈话，穷凶极恶地鼓吹要越南人民向美国侵略者投降的“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的政策。这个谈话表明，对于死不认输的美帝国主义，只有坚决地打，狠狠地打，直到使它彻底失败。
    腊斯克的这篇谈话洋洋万言，要而言之就是对越南人民、特别是越南民主共和国施加压力，要它停止对南方兄弟抗美救国斗争事业的支援，否则，这个面临穷途末路的美帝国主义就要继续对越南北方进行狂轰滥炸。
    腊斯克在谈话中蛮横地要遭到美帝国主义侵略的越南人民同美国侵略者一起采取“对等行动”、“相互行动”，“要认识采取起码的对等行动的必要性”等等，说穿了就是要越南人民牺牲抗美救国的大业，向美国投降。他满口强盗逻辑，说什么“单靠我们停止一半战争是不可能使战争停下来的”。“如果我们停止轰炸，对方将做些什么……我们需要在这个问题上有某种答复。”
    事实很明显也很简单，要解决越南问题，决不是什么美国侵略者和被侵略者越南人民采取“相互行动”、“对等行动”的问题，而是要美帝国主义者立即和无条件地把它的全部侵略军队撤离越南南方。这样，越南人民就可以自己解决自己的问题，和平就可以恢复。而腊斯克却坚持美国的侵略和战争政策，说什么要美国“滚出南越”，“显然是不可能的”，这就更加暴露了他鼓吹的“对等行动”的狼子野心。
    腊斯克强调美国在越南问题上玩弄反革命两手策略的“态度没有改变”。他说：“我们准备把军事问题当作军事问题来处理，我们准备同对方讨论双方可以采取什么军事性质的行动，而把这个问题推向和平”。
    美国国务卿在挥舞大棒的同时，又鼓吹进行
  “秘密外交”来推行“和谈”阴谋。他主张“由双方进行悄悄的外交活动来会谈和平和讨论降低暴力行动的相互步骤”。他说，美国“一直在使用我们采取的各种办法来邀请和进行这种会谈”，“一切渠道仍然畅通”。
    腊斯克的嚣张气焰，是苏联修正主义统治集团勾结美英帝国主义和各国反动派，加紧策划拍卖越南人民抗美救国斗争事业的阴谋的必然结果。为了推行这个阴谋，苏联修正主义统治集团及其娄罗正在进行紧张活动。目前正在访问英国的苏修头目柯西金，勾结英国首相威尔逊，恳求约翰逊推行“停炸诱和”的阴谋。在这同时，印度反动派和刚同另一个苏修头目波德戈尔内举行过会谈的梵蒂冈教皇保罗六世，也一起出来鼓吹使春节“停火”变成“无限期的停火”，为“进行谈判开辟道路”。联合国秘书长吴丹和美国驻联合国代表戈德堡不久也将为兜售“和谈”阴谋到东南亚活动。
    在苏修统治集团带头煽起的一片求和声中，美帝国主义正在得寸进尺，抬高要价。美国《基督教科学箴言报》二月七日指出，“总统及其顾问正在采取一条更强硬的路线”，“白宫在目前的情绪下并不想走上进行向后退的困难的谈判的道路”。《华盛顿邮报》二月八日的社论说得更加露骨：“和平的谣传有时实际上是以另一种手段进行的战争”，“美国必须继续作好战争的准备”，以“军事优势”压对方作出“相称的让步”。
