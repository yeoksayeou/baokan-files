Zhejiang Province's Quzhou County's Zhangtan Commune recently held a meeting of cadres at the commune, brigade, and production team levels, as well as representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants. The meeting seriously studied and discussed the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country," and arranged for spring ploughing and production work. At the meeting, everyone unanimously expressed their determination to firmly respond to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's latest call, to grasp the revolution and promote production, and to mobilize all forces to carry out this year's spring ploughing and production work.

The poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives and three-level cadres who attended the meeting were greatly inspired by studying the Party Central Committee's letter. They enthusiastically shouted: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! The poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives and the commune revolutionary cadres expressed that they would definitely follow the Party Central Committee's instructions, grasp the revolution, promote production, and do a better job in the preparatory work and spring ploughing production this year than in any previous year. They said: Firing the first shot of spring ploughing this year not only relates to the entire year's production but is also a powerful blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all the ghosts and monsters in society. It is a blow to imperialism and revisionism. The commune cadres who made general mistakes, after studying the Party Central Committee's letter, excitedly said: The Party Central Committee has pointed out the direction for us to strive for. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, strive to make amends in spring ploughing production, and definitely stand on the side of the revolutionary cadres to carry out spring ploughing production well. They decided that after the meeting, they would go to the production teams to live and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants, eat with them, live with them, labor with them, and discuss with them, and immediately launch a spring ploughing production high tide. Some brigade cadres, after studying the Party Central Committee's letter, said: Chairman Mao once again made it clear that the Party's cadre policy is to stand on the side of the revolution. They expressed their determination to firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, break personal interests, and consciously revolutionize, and seriously carry out spring ploughing production.

The meeting studied and discussed the current spring ploughing production work, implemented the spring ploughing production plan, and required that this year's early rice planting area be expanded by more than five hundred mu compared to last year. The spring greening and spring water conservancy work also required to be better than in the past. The meeting also checked and arranged various specific measures for the current preparatory work, and arranged for the relevant departments of the commune to support spring ploughing production with specific requirements. To quickly launch a spring ploughing production high tide, the commune established a revolutionary production committee and decided to dispatch more than forty cadres from the commune, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives to go to the brigades in groups, vigorously publicize the Party Central Committee's letter, and help carry out spring ploughing production well.

After the meeting, many brigade and production team cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives immediately rushed back to convene a meeting of commune members, read and discuss the Party Central Committee's letter, study and arrange the current spring ploughing production work.

    动员一切力量扎扎实实搞好春耕生产 
    犯过错误的干部决心站在革命派一边，努力在春耕生产中将功补过
    新华社杭州二十六日电　浙江省衢县樟潭公社最近召开公社、生产大队、生产队三级干部和贫下中农代表会议，认真学习、讨论《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，布置春耕生产工作。会上，大家一致表示坚决响应毛主席和党中央的最新号召，认真地抓革命，促生产，动员一切力量搞好今年的春耕生产。
    到会的贫下中农代表和三级干部学习党中央的信时，受到极大鼓舞。他们热烈欢呼：中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！贫下中农代表和公社革命派的同志们纷纷表示，一定要按照党中央的指示，大抓革命，狠促生产，把备耕和春耕生产工作搞得好上加好，搞得比过去任何一年都好。他们说：打响今年春耕第一炮，不仅关系到全年生产，也是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上一切牛鬼蛇神的有力打击，是给帝国主义和修正主义的当头一棒。公社犯有一般错误的干部学习了党中央的信后，激动地说：党中央给我们指出了努力方向，我们一定要听毛主席的话，努力在春耕生产中将功补过，一定要站在革命派一边，把春耕生产搞好。他们决定开完会就到生产队去和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动同商量，立即掀起春耕生产高潮。有的生产大队干部学习了党中央的信后说：毛主席再一次讲明了党的干部政策，再不好好地干，就对不住毛主席。他们表示要坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，破私立公，自觉革命，认真搞好春耕生产。
    会上研究和讨论了当前的春耕生产工作，落实了春耕生产规划，要求今年早稻播种面积比去年扩大五百多亩，春季绿化和春修水利工作也要求比过去做得好。会议还检查和布置了当前备耕工作的各项具体措施，布置了公社各有关部门支援春耕生产的具体要求。为了迅速掀起春耕生产高潮，公社成立了革命生产委员会，并决定由公社干部和供销社、信用社、手工业社等部门抽调四十多名干部分头下队，大张旗鼓地宣传党中央的信和帮助搞好春耕生产。
    会议结束后，许多生产大队、生产队干部和贫下中农代表立即赶回去召开社员大会，宣读和讨论党中央的信，研究和布置当前的春耕生产工作。
