Chairman Mao, the People of Mauritania Love You!
Wearing Chairman Mao's Badge is the Greatest Honor

Whether in the capital of Mauritania, Nouakchott, or in the residence of the Chinese Agricultural Survey Team in Rosso (a city in southwestern Mauritania), many Mauritanians eagerly ask Chinese friends for Chairman Mao's badges. A worker, after receiving a Chairman Mao badge, happily said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's people. Being able to wear a Chairman Mao badge on my chest is the greatest honor!" Two carpenters repairing the Chinese Embassy building, when asking Chinese friends for Chairman Mao badges, excitedly gave a thumbs up and said, "Mao Zedong! Great!" After their request was fulfilled, they immediately carefully hung the Chairman Mao badge on their chests.

Hanging Chairman Mao's Portrait in the Highest Place

Many Mauritania friends also eagerly ask Chinese friends for large portraits of Chairman Mao. A middle school student in Nouakchott had repeatedly gone to the Chinese Embassy in December last year to ask for a large portrait of Chairman Mao, but since the Embassy had run out of such portraits, he did not achieve his goal. In early January this year, the youth came again to ask, finally obtaining a color portrait of Chairman Mao. He was extremely happy. But then he earnestly hoped that Chinese friends could give him another one. He excitedly explained, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of all of us. I also have an elder brother who loves Chairman Mao very much. He couldn't come in person because of his work, so this second one is for him." A friend named Ailabiba specially came from a distant place to the residence of the Chinese Agricultural Survey Team to ask for a portrait of Chairman Mao. When Chinese friends gave him the portrait, he happily said, "I will hang this portrait in the highest place in my room!"

Paying Respect to the Great Leader Chairman Mao

To meet the needs of the broad masses of the people of Mauritania, the Chinese Embassy in Mauritania set up a simple and unadorned reading room in its courtyard, with shelves displaying Chairman Mao's works for people to read. This small reading room, only about ten square meters, attracts a large number of readers every day, and many people come every day. One day, two people who looked like middle school students walked into the reading room. As soon as they saw the photo of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards on the wall, they both immediately stood at attention and raised their right hands to pay their respects to their beloved great leader of the world's revolutionary people.

    毛主席，毛里塔尼亚人民热爱您！
    戴上毛主席像章最光荣
    不论是在毛里塔尼亚首都努瓦克肖特，还是在中国农业考察组驻地罗索（毛里塔尼亚西南部的一个城市），许多毛里塔尼亚人一见到中国朋友就热情地要毛主席像章。一位工人得到一枚毛主席像章后高兴地说：“毛主席是世界人民的伟大领袖，我胸前能佩戴一枚毛主席像章是最大的光荣！”为中国大使馆修理房子的两位木工在向中国朋友索取毛主席像章时，激动地伸出大拇指说：“毛泽东！伟大！”当中国朋友满足了他们的要求后，他们立刻小心翼翼地将毛主席像章挂在胸前。
    把毛主席像挂在最高处
    许多毛里塔尼亚朋友还纷纷向中国朋友要大幅毛主席像。努瓦克肖特一位中学生在去年十二月份就曾接连几次到中国大使馆要大幅毛主席像，因为当时使馆的这种毛主席像已经被人要光，他没能达到目的。今年一月初，这位青年再次来要，终于要到一张毛主席彩色画像，他异常高兴。但接着他又恳切地希望中国朋友能再给他一张。他激动地解释说：“毛主席是我们大家的伟大领袖。我还有个哥哥，他也非常热爱毛主席，他因为工作忙不能亲自来，我要的这第二张就是为他要的。”一位叫艾勒阿比巴的朋友，特意从很远的地方来到中国农业考察组驻地要毛主席像。当中国朋友把毛主席像送给他时，他高兴地说：“我要把这张像挂在我室内最高的地方！”
    向伟大领袖毛主席致敬
    为适应毛里塔尼亚广大人民群众的要求，中国驻毛里塔尼亚大使馆院内布置了一个简单朴素的阅览室，书架上摆着供人们阅览的毛主席著作。这个只有十来平方米的小阅览室，每天却吸引着大量的读者，许多人是天天必来的。有一天，两个中学生模样的人走进阅览室，一眼望见墙上挂着毛主席接见红卫兵的照片，他们两人立刻不约而同地立正并举起右手恭恭敬敬地向他们无限敬爱的全世界革命人民的伟大领袖行礼致敬。
