Albanian newspapers and radio stations have condemned the crimes of Khrushchev's followers and paid tribute to the brave Chinese students!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 30th, the editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" published an article on the 29th stating that the Albanian people and the people of various countries fighting against imperialism still have fresh memories of the massacre that took place in Moscow in March 1965. Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership's savage suppression of Chinese students has occurred again. Their crime of savagely suppressing Chinese students in front of Lenin's and Stalin's mausoleums has once again exposed them as the mad enemies of the people of all countries, as open traitors to Marxism-Leninism, and as strikebreakers.

The article states that the Chinese students who enthusiastically returned to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They laid wreaths at the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin, demonstrating the sublime feelings of proletarian internationalism.

The article states that the Chinese students remained steadfast in the face of violence and defended the truth from beginning to end. The Albanian people and youth, educated by the Albanian Labor Party and Enver Hoxha with revolutionary spirit and proletarian internationalism, express their warm sympathy and fighting salute to the 69 brave Chinese students who selflessly defended Mao Zedong Thought under arduous conditions.

The article points out that the Brezhnev-Kosygin group are faithful followers of Khrushchev. They continue to fiercely oppose the glorious Communist Party of China and its leader Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people. They pick up some rotten goods from the stinking arsenal of bourgeois propaganda to slander the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people, attempting to hide the truth of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionists are sinking deeper and deeper on the path of betrayal and the restoration of capitalism. They use all means to suppress the Soviet people and all those who uphold revolutionary ideology and maintain the glorious traditions of the Great October Revolution. However, no crimes or slanders by the Khrushchev revisionists can stop the victory of Marxism-Leninism. All revisionists will meet a bad end, and their successors will not fare any better.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 31st, the Tirana Radio Station recently published a commentary stating that the bloody suppression of Chinese students studying in Europe by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is a premeditated fascist action.

The commentary states that the recent incident on Red Square is not accidental. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, modern revisionism and American imperialism have carried out a series of anti-China activities. They have maliciously slandered, attacked, and defamed the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is eliminating counter-revolutionary revisionists and right-wing elements of the bourgeoisie, uprooting all sources of revisionism, and blocking the possibility of restoring capitalism. This has made international modern revisionists and imperialists extremely anxious. Modern revisionists and imperialists are terrified by the influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought on the people of the world.

The commentary points out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the Soviet revisionists who have usurped power extremely panicked. What the Chinese people are doing now is a great encouragement and education for the Soviet people who will inevitably settle accounts with the Soviet revisionist traitors. For this reason, these traitors are doing their utmost to blacken the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution within the Soviet Union, attempting to incite the Soviet people to oppose the Chinese people.

The commentary points out that this incident is another manifestation of their extreme hatred and fear of the great Mao Zedong Thought. This has not only aroused the great indignation of the Chinese people but has also aroused the great outrage of the Soviet people and all revolutionary people around the world who oppose Soviet modern revisionism.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸电台谴责赫鲁晓夫门徒的罪行
    向英勇的中国留学生致敬！
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十九日发表编辑部文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民、进行反帝斗争的各国人民，对一九六五年三月在莫斯科发生的惨案还记忆犹新。现在苏修领导集团野蛮镇压中国学生的事又发生了，他们在列宁、斯大林陵墓前野蛮镇压中国学生的罪行，再一次赤裸裸地暴露出，他们是各国人民的疯狂敌人，是马克思列宁主义的公开叛徒，是工贼。
    文章说，热情回国参加无产阶级文化大革命的中国留学生，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。他们向列宁、斯大林陵墓敬献花圈，表现了无产阶级国际主义的崇高感情。
    文章说，中国学生在暴力面前毫不动摇，自始至终地保卫真理。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志用革命精神和无产阶级国际主义感情教育出来的阿尔巴尼亚全国人民和青年，对在艰巨条件下忘我保卫毛泽东思想的六十九名英勇的中国学生表示热烈的同情并致以战斗敬礼。
    文章指出，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团是赫鲁晓夫的忠实门徒，他们继续疯狂地反对光荣的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志、反对中国人民。他们从资产阶级宣传机器臭不可闻的武库中拣起一些破烂货对中国共产党、毛泽东同志和中国人民进行诬蔑，企图向苏联人民隐瞒中国无产阶级文化大革命的真相。苏联修正主义者在叛徒道路上、在复辟资本主义的道路上越陷越深，他们使用一切手段镇压苏联人民，镇压所有保持伟大十月革命的光荣传统、全力维护革命思想的人。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的任何罪行和诬蔑都阻挡不住马克思列宁主义革命思想的胜利前进。所有修正主义者都没有好下场，他们的继承人也不会有好下场。
    据新华社地拉那三十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚地拉那电台最近发表评论说，苏修统治集团血腥镇压中国留欧学生，是一个法西斯的预谋行动。
    评论说，最近发生在红场上的事件决不是偶然的。自从中国无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，现代修正主义和美帝国主义进行了一系列反华活动。他们百般地诬蔑、攻击和诋毁人民中国、中国共产党和毛泽东主席。中国无产阶级文化大革命正在扫除反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级右派分子，拔掉一切产生修正主义的根子、堵塞复辟资本主义的可能性，这就使国际现代修正主义者和帝国主义者惶惶不安。现代修正主义者和帝国主义者被中国文化大革命和毛泽东思想对世界人民的影响吓得胆颤心惊。
    评论指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命使篡夺了政权的苏联修正主义者惊慌万状。中国人民目前所做的，对于早晚要清算苏修叛徒的苏联人民来说，是一个巨大的鼓舞和教育。正因如此，这些叛徒在苏联国内竭力对中国文化大革命抹黑，企图煽动苏联人民反对中国人民。
    评论指出，这一事件是他们无比仇视和害怕伟大的毛泽东思想影响的又一表现。这不仅激起了中国人民的极大愤怒，而且也激起了苏联人民和世界上一切反对苏联现代修正主义的革命人民的极大愤慨。
