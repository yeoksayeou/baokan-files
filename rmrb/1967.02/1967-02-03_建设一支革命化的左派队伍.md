The proletarian revolutionary forces achieving great unity will be a fatal blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and to the few stubborn elements who insist on the reactionary bourgeois line.

However, they will not accept their fate and will try every means to sabotage. At present, they are exploiting the non-proletarian thoughts existing within us to carry out divisive and destructive activities within the revolutionary ranks, making it impossible for the revolutionary forces to unite and the task of seizing power unachievable. We revolutionary rebels must remain highly vigilant and absolutely not fall for their tricks!

To achieve the great unity of the revolutionary rebels and to carry out the political task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must use Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Correcting Errors in the Party" as a weapon. We must strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and build a proletarian revolutionary force armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "Within the Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army, there exist various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly corrected, the great revolutionary struggle of China will not be able to entrust the Fourth Red Army with its tasks." The erroneous thoughts that are currently hindering the great unity of the revolutionary rebels are precisely the localism, factionalism, ultra-democracy, anti-organizational views, subjectivism, and individualism that Chairman Mao pointed out in this article. Some comrades only see their own revolutionary nature and do not see the revolutionary nature of others; they only see their own achievements and do not see their own shortcomings; they are willing to do big, noisy work but are not willing to do hard, meticulous work. All of these are reflections of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts, which ultimately boil down to the word "self." To do a good job in the Cultural Revolution, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit is the most fundamental principle. The entire process of the Cultural Revolution is also a process of breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit. Only by thoroughly eliminating selfish thoughts can one be thoroughly revolutionary.

Revolutionary nature must also be combined with scientific nature and organizational discipline. One must have the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight and dare to charge, as well as the revolutionary strategy and fighting art of the proletariat. We must thoroughly oppose and specially oppose the "organizational discipline" of those who are taking the capitalist road, but we must establish the revolutionary organizational discipline of the proletariat. We are making a revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. All actions must be subject to Mao Zedong Thought and must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious traditions of the people's army.

To accomplish the great political task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, the most urgent thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living manner, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions, making the revolutionary rebels highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready, and ultimately achieving a thorough victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    建设一支革命化的左派队伍

    无产阶级革命派实现大联合，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，是致命的打击。
    但是，他们决不甘心死亡，总要千方百计地进行破坏。当前，他们利用我们内部存在的非无产阶级思想，在革命队伍里搞分裂破坏活动，使革命队伍联合不起来，夺权任务无法实现。对于他们这个新反扑阴谋，我们革命造反派必须保持高度的警惕，绝对不能上当！
    要实现革命造反派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权的政治任务，就必须以毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作做武器，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，建设一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命队伍。
    毛主席说：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”当前不利于革命造反派大联合的错误思想，正是毛主席在这篇文章中所指出的本位主义、小团体主义、极端民主化、非组织观点、主观主义、个人主义等。有的同志只看到自己的革命性，看不到别人的革命性；只看到自己的成绩，看不到自己的缺点；愿干大轰大嗡的工作，不愿干艰苦细致的工作。所有这些，都是资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想的反映，归根到底是一个“私”字。搞好文化大革命，破私立公是最根本的一条。整个文化大革命的过程，也是破私立公的过程，只有彻底去掉私心杂念，才能彻底革命。
    革命性还必须与科学性、组织纪律性相结合，既要有敢打敢冲的革命闯劲，又要有无产阶级的革命策略和斗争艺术。对于走资本主义道路当权派的“组织纪律”，我们要大反特反，但是反掉这种“组织纪律”，是为了建立无产阶级的革命的组织纪律。我们是在无产阶级专政条件下闹革命的，一切行动必须服从毛泽东思想，坚决听毛主席的话，继承和发扬人民军队的光荣传统。
    要实现毛主席交给我们的伟大政治任务，最最迫切的就是要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来指导我们的一切行动，使革命造反派非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化，最后夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底的胜利。
