The red rebels of Heilongjiang Province have created many new experiences that embody Mao Zedong Thought in their struggle for power. This is a great victory for the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The experiences of the red rebels of Heilongjiang Province are a good example for us to learn from. The Cultural Revolution in our factory, like the rest of the country and the province, is in a great situation. We follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are directed against the oppression of imperialism, colonialism, and their running dogs." Over the past few months, our proletarian revolutionary rebels have been thinking about seizing power, talking about seizing power, and fighting for seizing power. We are determined to take back the reins of power and hold them firmly in our own hands. At this critical moment when we are launching a struggle for power, revolutionary cadres have stepped forward to fight alongside us; the soldiers and officers of the Shaanxi garrison of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically and wholeheartedly aided us. The strong support of the army has greatly boosted our strength, enabling us to quickly seize all power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

"The three-in-one combination, united struggle for power" is the experience of Heilongjiang, and it is also our experience in Shanxi. The "three-in-one combination" is excellent, a thousand times good, ten thousand times good! We not only need the "three-in-one combination" to seize power, but also to hold power, using this "three-in-one combination" to build a new Shanxi.

In this struggle for power, whether or not to implement the "three-in-one combination" is one of the standards to measure whether it is true power seizure or false power seizure. Our revolutionary mass organizations must unite closely with the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary cadres, fight together, and win together!

    夺权要“三结合”　掌权也要“三结合”

    黑龙江省红色造反者，在夺权斗争中创造了许多体现毛泽东思想的新经验，这是以毛主席为代表的革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    黑龙江省红色造反者的经验，是我们学习的好榜样。我们厂的文化大革命，和全国、全省一样，也是一派大好形势。我们遵循毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”几个月来，我们无产阶级革命造反派心里想的是夺权，嘴里说的是夺权，干的是夺权。我们决心把印把子夺回来，牢牢掌握在自己手中。当我们正在展开夺权斗争的紧急关头，革命的领导干部站出来和我们共同战斗；中国人民解放军驻山西部队指战员，满腔热情地、全心全意地援助了我们。解放军的大力支持，给我们革命造反派增添了巨大的力量，使我们很快从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺回了一切大权。
    “三位一体，联合夺权”，是黑龙江的经验，也是我们山西的经验。“三结合”好得很，一千个好！一万个好！我们不仅夺权要“三结合”，掌权也要“三结合”，用这个“三结合”来建设新山西。
    在这场夺权斗争中，执行不执行“三结合”，是衡量真夺权还是假夺权的标准之一。我们革命群众组织要和人民解放军、革命的领导干部紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
