The Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee, the provisional highest authority in the province, issued an open letter on February 3, calling on all revolutionary rebels, revolutionary organizations, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres in the province's agricultural sector to seize the revolution and promote production, thoroughly smash economism, and repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The open letter states: The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our province is excellent! The poor and lower-middle peasants and red rebels have risen up to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed! They have begun to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have responded to Chairman Mao's great call, seized the revolution, and promoted production, creating a great situation throughout the province's countryside.

The open letter points out that in this great situation, the class enemies are unwilling to accept their own defeat. Just as Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." The facts are exactly like this. At the time when the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and red rebels rise up to seize power, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party blow cold winds and shoot dark arrows, hoisting the black flag of economism to disrupt the revolution and production, attempting to divert a serious political struggle onto the wrong path of economism. This is a new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, an extremely sharp class struggle.

The open letter states that at present, the counter-revolutionary economism wind is still raging fiercely in the countryside of our province. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, taking advantage of the year-end distribution, incite some uninformed masses to resist Chairman Mao's strategic directive of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and for the people, and resist Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. They ignore the actual situation of the production team and implement a one-sided policy of retaining less and distributing more, buying off the masses, and shifting the direction of the struggle.

The open letter points out that economism specifically manifests as follows: One, distributing production expenses. Two, retaining less or distributing public accumulation. Three, repaying less loans and mechanized farming fees. Four, distributing reserve grain. Five, selling cattle, horses, seeds, and farming tools and other means of production for distribution. Six, using high work points and subsidies to incite peasants to enter the city. Seven, falsifying and fabricating, creating land disputes, demanding compensation, dividing collective or state-owned enterprises, and demanding welfare benefits, etc.

The open letter emphasizes the harm of economism. The letter states that the capitalist-roaders, hoisting the black flag of economism, have evil intentions and vicious methods. They attempt to empty collective property, disintegrate the collective economy of the people's communes, undermine the foundations of socialism, disrupt the market, increase the state's burden, disrupt the national economy, corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, and disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The capitalist-roaders also collude with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, engaging in covert activities and profiting from them.

The open letter calls on all red rebels in the province's countryside to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, sharpen their eyes, and timely expose the enemy's tricks. They must defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death, thoroughly smash economism, and repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee specially issues an urgent call to all revolutionary organizations, red rebels, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres in the province's agricultural sector:

(1) Definitely study and apply "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," master the thought weapon of Mao Zedong Thought that is invincible in battle, smash selfishness and promote selflessness, and become a firm red rebel armed with Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, combine the study of the editorials of "Red Flag," the editorials of "People's Daily," and the first notice of the Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee, raise ideological awareness, and enhance combat effectiveness.

(2) The revolutionary factions of the proletariat should unite, quickly seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, and seize party power, political power, financial power, and the power to lead the Cultural Revolution, truly putting them in the hands of the red rebels. Use the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat to smash counter-revolutionary economism.

(3) Fully mobilize the masses and use various forms to thoroughly expose the enemy's tricks, drag out the plotters, and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink. For the main culprits with serious offenses, vicious methods, and extremely bad influence, hold large-scale criticism and struggle meetings to eliminate the influence and stop the evil trends.

(4) Promote proletarian politics. Through methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, calculating accounts, revealing the bottom line, finding out who was deceived, and finding out the harm, launch a major campaign against economism, and firmly return the grain, money, and goods that should not have been distributed; and order the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to return the grain, money, and goods they distributed in excess immediately and in full.

(5) Revolutionary organizations, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in various places should go to the masses and combine with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Mobilize all propaganda machines, seize favorable opportunities, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies, seize the revolution, promote production, and smash counter-revolutionary economism.

(6) Comrades who are poor and lower-middle peasants and red rebels should take immediate action! Seal up the grain, cash, and stored materials of the production teams, and they cannot be used without the approval of the revolutionary factions. The relevant departments of the state's commerce and finance, banks, etc., should provide necessary assistance.

(7) If it is found that the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements continue to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they should be severely dealt with according to law.

The open letter finally states that at present, spring plowing is approaching, and there are only forty to fifty days left before plowing and sowing wheat. The preparation for plowing is urgent. At this critical moment, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party are again playing tricks and shirking their duties in their work, attempting to disrupt production. The revolutionary organizations, red rebels, broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres in the countryside should take positive action, seize the power, and truly put it in the hands of the red rebels. Revolutionary organizations in various places should seriously implement Chairman Mao's directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," quickly establish and strengthen the production leadership teams, make them work normally, achieve double victories in revolution and production, and achieve greater harvests in agricultural production in 1967.

    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会紧急号召农业战线革命派
    突出政治大造经济主义的反  抓紧备耕夺取今年更大丰收
    据新华社哈尔滨七日电　黑龙江省临时最高权力机构——黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会，二月三日发出一封公开信，号召全省农业战线红色造反者、各革命组织、广大贫下中农、革命职工和革命干部，抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎经济主义，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    公开信说：我省无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很！广大贫下中农红色造反者起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线顽固分子的反，造没有改造好的地富反坏右分子的反！开始从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权了！广大贫下中农响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命，促生产，全省农村出现了一片大好形势。
    公开信指出，在这种大好形势下，阶级敌人不甘心他们自己的失败。正象毛主席教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”事实正是如此。在广大贫下中农、红色造反者起来夺权的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮阴风、放暗箭，打出了经济主义这面黑旗，破坏革命，破坏生产，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引向经济主义的邪路。这是资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，是极其尖锐的阶级斗争。
    公开信说，现在，我省农村的反革命经济主义妖风刮得还十分猖狂，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派借年终分配之机，煽动一部分不明真相的群众，对抗毛主席关于备战备荒为人民的战略方针，对抗毛主席关于正确处理国家、集体和个人三者关系的指示，不顾本生产队的实际情况，实行片面的少留多分，收买群众，转移斗争的大方向。
    公开信指出，经济主义具体表现如下：一、分掉生产费。二、少留或分掉公共积累。三、少还贷款和机耕费。四、分掉储备粮。五、变卖牛马、种子、农具等生产资料参加分配。六、以高工分、补助，鼓动农民群众进城。七、弄虚作假，制造土地纠纷，索取退赔款，瓜分社办企业或国营企业，闹福利待遇等等。
    公开信强调指出了经济主义的危害。信中说，走资本主义道路的当权派，打出经济主义这面黑旗，用心险恶，手段毒辣。他们企图分空集体财产，瓦解人民公社集体经济，挖社会主义墙脚，冲击市场，增加国家负担，扰乱国民经济，腐蚀革命群众斗争意志，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。走资本主义道路的当权派，还勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子，阴谋活动，从中渔利。
    公开信号召全省农村的红色造反者，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，擦亮眼睛，及时识破敌人的阴谋诡计。誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底粉碎经济主义，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会在公开信中特向全省农业战线上的各革命组织、红色造反者、广大贫下中农、革命职工、革命干部发出紧急号召：
    （一）一定要学好、用好“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，掌握好毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的思想武器，大破私字，大立公字，做一个坚强的用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色造反者。同时，结合学习《红旗》社论、《人民日报》社论、黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会的第一号通告等文件，提高思想认识，增强战斗力。
    （二）无产阶级革命派团结起来，迅速夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权，把党权、政权、财权和领导文化大革命的权通通夺过来，真正地掌握在红色造反者的手里。利用无产阶级专政的力量粉碎反革命经济主义。
    （三）要充分发动群众，运用各种形式，彻底揭穿敌人的阴谋诡计，把阴谋策划者揪出来，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。对情节严重、手段恶劣、影响极坏的首要分子要召开大规模的批判斗争会，肃清影响，刹住歪风。
    （四）要突出无产阶级政治。通过摆事实、讲道理、算细帐、亮家底、查上当、找危害等方式，大造经济主义的反，把不应该分得的粮、钱、物，坚决退回来；并勒令党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子和地富反坏右分子多分的粮、钱、物，立即如数退回。
    （五）各地革命组织、革命学生、革命干部，要到群众中去，同广大贫下中农相结合。开动所有的宣传机器，抓住有利时机，大力宣传毛泽东思想、宣传党的政策，抓革命，促生产，粉碎反革命经济主义。
    （六）广大贫下中农、红色造反者同志们，要立即行动起来！把生产队的粮食、现金、库存物资等查封起来，不经革命派的批准不能动用。国家财贸、银行等有关部门要给予必要的协助。
    （七）如果发现党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地富反坏右继续破坏无产阶级文化大革命者严肃法办。
    公开信最后说，当前，春耕已经迫近，离开犁种麦只有四五十天了，备耕工作刻不容缓。在这关键的时刻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派又在工作上拿把、撂挑子不干，妄图破坏生产。农村各革命组织、红色造反者、广大贫下中农、革命干部，应当积极行动起来，把大权夺过来，真正掌握在红色造反者手里。各地革命组织要认真执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，迅速把抓生产班子建立和健全起来，使之正常工作，夺取革命生产双胜利，夺取一九六七年农业生产的更大丰收。
