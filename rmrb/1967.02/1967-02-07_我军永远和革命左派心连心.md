Our Army Will Forever Stand with the Revolutionary Left

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops to a stage where the revolutionary leftists are uniting and seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a battle cry to the entire army: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the leftists. All officers and soldiers of our army have responded to Chairman Mao's great call with fervent enthusiasm and high morale, vowing to be the strong backbone of the revolutionary leftists.

The troops of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region have raised high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. At the critical moment of class struggle and counter-struggle for power, they have stood out, firmly and powerfully supporting the revolutionary leftists, setting an example for the entire army.

In this intense class struggle, all officers and soldiers of the army must be clear-cut in their stance, distinguish between friends and enemies, and most resolutely and powerfully support the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Distinguishing between friends and enemies and identifying the genuine revolutionary leftists is the primary task for the People's Liberation Army in supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces. How can we distinguish between friends and enemies and identify the genuine revolutionary leftists? The experience of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region troops tells us that the most fundamental approach is to rely on the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle are our most sharp weapon for distinguishing right from wrong in the stormy waves of class struggle. We must use Chairman Mao's method of class analysis, "use the Marxist-Leninist method to analyze political situations and estimate class forces," and use the "key" of the two-line struggle to measure and identify all issues. In the struggle between the two lines, in a region or a unit, regardless of how many organizations there are, ultimately there are only two factions. One stands on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and the other stands on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. One wants to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and the other wants to preserve the old capitalist order. One wants to "revolutionize," and the other wants to "preserve." This is the essence of the two-line struggle. We must firmly grasp this key issue. Only in this way can we have the clearest mind and the sharpest eyes, see through phenomena to the essence, dispel all confusion, and have a clear vision. Only in this way can we, in complex situations, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, unambiguously support the proletarian revolutionary forces, and never be deceived by the class enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without investigation, no right to speak." The broad revolutionary masses are the masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and they have the right to speak. Who are the key figures among those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road? They see it most clearly. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, step out among the masses, be their students, humbly learn from them, and be united with them in spirit, sharing their joys and sorrows, thinking what they think and worrying about what they worry about, we will be clear-sighted and never lose our way. We will be able to stand out at the most critical moments and provide strong support and assistance. The troops of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, at the crucial moment when the proletarian revolutionary forces rose up to seize power, were able to stand firmly and resolutely with the revolutionary forces. An important reason for this is that they went among the masses and established deep class sentiments with the revolutionary masses.

The People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. For decades, our army has been fighting and shedding blood to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as long as we hold high the red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and firmly believe in the masses, we will definitely be able to most powerfully support and assist the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Chairman Mao says: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve them wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." All officers and soldiers of our army must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great instruction. In the struggle for great unity and great seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary forces, we will make new contributions for the people and create new achievements.

### 我军永远和革命左派心连心

    我军永远和革命左派心连心
    在无产阶级文化大革命发展到革命左派实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派全面夺权斗争的新阶段，我们的伟大统帅毛主席向全军发出战斗号召：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。我军全体指战员以火样的热情，高昂的斗志，热烈地响应毛主席这一伟大号召，誓作革命左派的坚强后盾。
    山西省军区部队，高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，在两个阶级夺权和反夺权的关键时刻，他们挺身而出，坚决地有力地支持革命左派，为全军树立了榜样。
    在当前这场激烈的阶级大搏斗中，全军指战员一定要旗帜鲜明，分清敌我，最坚决、最有力地支持无产阶级革命派。
    分清敌我，辨明谁是真正的革命左派，这是人民解放军支持无产阶级革命派的首要问题。怎样才能分清敌我，怎样才能辨明谁是真正的革命左派呢？山西省军区部队的经验告诉我们，最根本的就是要靠伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说，是我们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中辨别一切是非的最锐利的武器。我们要用毛主席阶级分析的方法，“用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量”，用两条路线斗争这个“纲”，去衡量和识别一切问题。在两条路线的斗争中，一个地区，一个单位，不管有多少组织，归根到底就是两派。一个站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，一个站在资产阶级反动路线一边，一个要把社会主义革命进行到底，一个要保存资本主义的旧秩序，一个要“革”，一个要“保”，这就是两条路线斗争的实质。我们一定要紧紧抓住这个关键问题，只有这样，才能有最清醒的头脑，最锐利的眼睛，才能透过现象看到本质，才能拨开重重迷雾，洞察一切，才能够站得高，看得远，才能使我军在错综复杂的情况下，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，毫不含糊地支持无产阶级革命派，而决不被阶级敌人所迷惑。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有调查研究就没有发言权”。广大革命群众是无产阶级文化大革命的主人，他们最有发言权，谁是党内走资本主义道路当权派的头面人物，他们看得最清楚。只要我们按照毛主席的教导，迈开双脚，到群众里面去，做他们的小学生，老老实实地向他们学习，和他们心连心，和他们同呼吸共命运，想他们所想，急他们所急，就会耳聪目明，不迷失方向，就会在他们最需要的关键时刻，挺身而出，给予有力的支持和援助。山西省军区部队，在无产阶级革命派奋起夺权的紧要关头，能够旗帜鲜明，坚决地支持革命派，重要的一条就是他们到群众里面去，和革命群众建立了深厚的阶级感情。
    人民解放军无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。几十年来，我军一直在为捍卫毛主席的革命路线流血奋斗。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，只要我们高高地举起以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的鲜红旗帜，坚决地相信群众，就一定能够最有力地支持和援助无产阶级革命派。
    毛主席说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们全军指战员，一定要牢牢记住毛主席的这个伟大指示，在无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的斗争中，为人民作出新的贡献，建立新的功勋。　（二月六日）
