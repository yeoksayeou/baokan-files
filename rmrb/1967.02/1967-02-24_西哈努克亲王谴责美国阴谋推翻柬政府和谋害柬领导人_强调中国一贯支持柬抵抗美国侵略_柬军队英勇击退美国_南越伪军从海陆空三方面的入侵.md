Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia, the head of state, recently published an article in the latest issue of *Jeune Afrique* magazine. In it, he stated that Cambodia is indeed a friend of the People's Republic of China. He pointed out that this great country has consistently supported Cambodia in its resistance against the aggression of American imperialism and the governments of Thailand and South Vietnam (puppets).

Sihanouk noted that China has provided Cambodia with unconditional military and economic aid. China has always respected and valued Cambodia's neutrality. He said, "In our foreign relations, we practice the principle of mutual benefit. The Chinese people treat us with friendship, so how can we not reciprocate with friendship? We are friends of China."

When discussing relations with the United States, Sihanouk pointed out that the U.S. has been continually bombing and conducting ground attacks on Cambodia, and supporting the governments of Thailand and South Vietnam (puppets) in their aggression against Cambodian territory. He emphasized, "Everyone knows that we do not show weakness to the United States. Our public opinion, our newspapers, and I myself often sharply condemn them."

Sihanouk said, "We also accuse the Americans of consistently trying to overthrow our nationalist and neutral government and replace it with a government that obeys them, that is, the government of the 'Free Khmer' traitors led by Son Ngoc Thanh."

In his article, he revealed that since 1959, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have been relentlessly trying to harm him and his parents. He said that the U.S. is still supporting Cambodian traitors in their divisive and conspiratorial activities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 23rd, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces invaded Cambodia from the air, land, and sea on the 18th, 20th, and 21st.

On the 20th at 10:30 AM, approximately 200 U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet soldiers, under the cover of air support, invaded the Cambodian village of Ta Veng. These invaders fired at the Cambodian flag after landing, then proceeded to advance into Cambodian territory. At the same time, American bandit planes and U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet artillery stationed in South Vietnam heavily bombed and shelled Cambodian territory. The brave Cambodian national defense forces and militias, fearless of the violence, resolutely fought back against the invading enemy. After three hours of intense battle, the invaders were ultimately defeated.

On the 21st, American bandit planes, including B-52 bombers, repeatedly invaded the airspace above Ta Veng village, bombing and strafing the village. Prior to this, on February 18th, several U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet ships, under the cover of aircraft, brazenly invaded Cambodian waters, firing at the Cambodian forward outposts and villages on the right bank of the Mekong River (Kandal Province), wounding two Cambodian national defense soldiers. Simultaneously, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet aircraft invading Cambodian airspace fired rockets at the ground. The Cambodian navy and garrison troops bravely fought back against the invaders.

The Cambodian newspaper *Nouvelle de l'Agence Khmère* published an editorial on the 23rd, stating that such despicable aggression reminds those who are talking about "peace and negotiations in Vietnam" that their wishes and reality are miles apart. The editorial said, "Against the aggressors, we must fight back."

    西哈努克亲王谴责美国阴谋推翻柬政府和谋害柬领导人

    柬军队英勇击退美国—南越伪军从海陆空三方面的入侵
    新华社巴黎二十一日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王在最近一期《青年非洲》杂志上发表文章说，柬埔寨确实是中华人民共和国的朋友。他指出，中国这个伟大的国家一直支持柬埔寨抵抗美帝国主义以及泰国和南越（傀儡）当局的侵略活动。
    西哈努克指出，中国向柬埔寨提供了不附任何条件的军事和经济援助。中国一贯对柬埔寨的中立表示重视和尊重。他说：“在我国的对外关系方面，我们是实行互惠原则的，中国人民对我们友好相待，我们怎么可能不报之以友好呢？我们是中国的朋友。”
    西哈努克在谈到同美国的关系时指出，美国不断地对柬埔寨进行轰炸和地面袭击，并支持泰国和南越（傀儡）当局侵犯柬埔寨领土的侵略活动。他强调说：“大家知道，我们对美国是不示弱的，我国舆论、我国报刊以及我本人常常是尖锐地予以谴责。”
    西哈努克说：“我们还要指责美国人的，是他们一贯竭力要推翻我国民族主义的和中立的政府，而代之以一个听命于他们的政府，也就是山玉成的‘自由高棉’叛徒们的政府。”
    他在文章中揭露，从一九五九年以来，美国中央情报局和五角大楼不遗余力地要谋害他和他的父母。他说，美国现在还在支持柬埔寨的叛徒进行分裂和阴谋活动。
    据新华社金边二十三日电　美国—南越伪军十八日、二十日和二十一日连续地从空中、陆上、海面侵犯柬埔寨。
    二十日十时三十分，约二百名美国—南越伪军在空军的掩护下，侵入了柬埔寨的达温村。这些侵略者向悬挂着的柬埔寨国旗开火后，随即向柬埔寨领土推进。与此同时，美国强盗飞机和在南越领土上的美国—南越伪军的炮兵猛烈地轰炸和炮轰柬埔寨领土。英勇的柬埔寨国防军和民兵，不畏强暴，坚决回击入侵的敌军。经过三个小时的激战，侵略者最后溃败。
    二十一日，美国强盗飞机，其中包括B—52型轰炸机，多次侵入达温村的上空，对这个村庄进行轰炸和扫射。在这以前，二月十八日，美国—南越伪军的几艘舰艇在飞机的掩护下，明目张胆地侵入柬埔寨水域，向设在湄公河右岸（干丹省）的柬埔寨前沿哨所和村庄开火，打伤二名柬埔寨国防军士兵。同时，侵入柬埔寨领空的美国—南越伪军的飞机向地面发射火箭。柬埔寨的海军和驻军对侵略者进行了英勇地回击。
    柬埔寨《新电讯报》二十三日发表社论指出，这种卑鄙的侵略提醒那些正在谈论“越南的和平与谈判”的人们，他们的愿望和现实是相距千里的。社论说，对侵略者必须以牙还牙。
