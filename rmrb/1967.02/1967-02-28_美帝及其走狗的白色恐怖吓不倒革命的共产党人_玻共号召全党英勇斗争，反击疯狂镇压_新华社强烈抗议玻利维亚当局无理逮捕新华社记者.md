The Bolivian Communist Party recently issued a letter to the Bolivian people and all party members, strongly condemning the anti-people repression wave launched by the pro-American dictatorial government of Barrientos. The letter calls on all members of the Bolivian Communist Party to redouble their efforts and persist in the just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

The letter points out that the Barrientos government of Bolivia is handing over more and more of the country's resources to the insatiable imperialists. The broad masses of Bolivian workers are suffering from unemployment, hunger, and poverty under the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Recently, Bolivian Communists who have been fighting for the interests of the Bolivian people have been subjected to savage repression by the Barrientos government. In the capital La Paz, Sucre, and Cochabamba, there have been serious incidents of searches and arrests of Communists. Currently, more than ten Communist Party members have been arrested. The reactionary authorities have also arrested leaders of other political parties and trade unions.

The letter states that the Barrientos government's savage persecution will not suppress the struggle of the suffering Bolivian people. The government's repression of the Bolivian Communist Party only shows that the path taken by the Bolivian Communist Party is correct. This repression can only strengthen the fighting spirit of the Bolivian Communists. The letter calls on all party members to redouble their efforts and persist in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

The New China News Agency sent a telegram to Bolivian President Rene Barrientos Ortuno on February 27, strongly protesting the unjust arrest of New China News Agency reporter Jorge Echezu Alvarado by the Bolivian authorities, and demanding the immediate restoration of Echezu Alvarado's personal freedom and the guarantee of all his legitimate rights as a journalist.

The protest telegram points out that the unjust arrest of New China News Agency reporter Jorge Echezu Alvarado by the pro-American dictatorial regime in Bolivia is a complete violation of the principles of press freedom. Echezu Alvarado was unjustly arrested by the Bolivian authorities in La Paz on February 21.

    信件表示，巴里恩托斯政府这种疯狂的迫害，决压制不住受苦受难的玻利维亚人民的斗争。反动政府对玻利维亚共产党的镇压，只能说明玻利维亚共产党所走的道路是正确的，这种镇压只能增强玻利维亚共产党人的斗志。信件号召全体党员加倍地工作，坚持反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。
