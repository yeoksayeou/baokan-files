The people of Mauritania have an unbounded love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They particularly enjoy reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

In Nouakchott, there is a young Mauritanian medical worker who, several years ago, sought out Chairman Mao's works to read. He treasures Chairman Mao's works as his most precious spiritual nourishment. On weekends or holidays, he often discusses his study experiences with friends. The more he studies Chairman Mao's works, the more interested he becomes. Therefore, he very much wanted to obtain a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to carry with him and study at any time.

Not long ago, his wish was fulfilled: he received a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Chinese friend.

A few days later, he happily told the Chinese friend: "This book is wonderful. It contains the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. Such a good book must be read word by word and sentence by sentence with great care." He then took out his copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which was already marked with many lines, and recited several passages fluently on the spot.

    一字一句认真阅读
    毛里塔尼亚人民无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想。他们最爱读《毛主席语录》。
    努瓦克肖特有一位年轻的毛里塔尼亚医务工作者，几年前他就想方设法寻求毛主席的著作阅读，他把毛主席著作当作最宝贵的精神食粮。星期天或假日里，他还经常和朋友们交流学习心得。他越学毛主席著作，兴趣就越浓，所以很想能得到一本《毛主席语录》，以便随身携带，随时学习。
    前不久，他的这个愿望实现了：他从中国朋友那里得到了一本法文版的《毛主席语录》。
    几天之后他高兴地对中国朋友说：“这本书真好，它包括了毛泽东思想的精华，这样的好书，必须一字一句地认真阅读。”他顺手从衣袋里掏出他那本已经划了许多横线的《毛主席语录》，并当场熟练地背诵了好几段。
