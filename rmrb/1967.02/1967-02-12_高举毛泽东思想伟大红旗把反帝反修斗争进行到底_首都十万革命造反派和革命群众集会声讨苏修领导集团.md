Ten thousand revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in the capital hold a rally to denounce the Soviet revisionist leadership clique

Comrade Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, Jiang Qing, and international friends from the five continents attend the rally

The rally sternly warns the Soviet revisionist ruling clique: The serious demands put forward in our country's statement must be carried out, not one bit less. We mean what we say. All reactionaries who oppose the Chinese people will not have a good ending!

According to Xinhua News Agency, on February 11, more than ten thousand revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses from various sectors in the capital held a grand rally and demonstration. Once again, they sternly warned the Soviet revisionist ruling clique: The serious demands put forward in our country's statement must be carried out, not one bit less. We mean what we say. All reactionaries who oppose the Chinese people will not have a good ending!

The proletarian revolutionary forces in the capital, who are currently seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, formed a mighty army today. With indignation in their hearts, they strongly protested against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's bloody suppression of our students in Europe, their organization of thugs to break into our embassy in the Soviet Union, their violation of our sovereignty, and their beating of our diplomatic personnel. During the rally and demonstration, they declared on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people: The great Chinese people will definitely hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better, and use the new victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to repel the rampant attacks of Soviet revisionism; together with the revolutionary people of the world, they will carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism, the head of imperialism, and modern revisionism, with the Soviet leadership clique at its center, through to the end!

Since the Soviet authorities manufactured the Red Square bloodshed incident on January 25, as the Soviet authorities have escalated their anti-China atrocities, more than two million revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in the capital have gathered in front of the Soviet embassy in China over the past half month, holding powerful demonstrations and protests, angrily denouncing the Soviet authorities' series of shocking anti-China bloodshed incidents and their heinous crimes of deliberately worsening relations between the two countries.

Central leaders Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, and Jiang Qing attended today's rally of the revolutionary rebels in the capital to angrily denounce the Soviet fascist atrocities.

International friends from the five continents who are currently in Beijing attended today's rally. Among them are: Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association, Sannanayake, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, Charudatta, famous black leader from the United States, Robert Williams, Head of the delegation of the Malayan National Liberation League in China, Sharmah, Assistant to the Representative of the Thai Patriotic Front abroad, Mongkon Nanasong, Head of the Beijing Office of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Galib, Japanese representative, Saionji Kiyoshi, Indonesian representative, Willy, Isa, Sudanese representative, Kair, American representative, Adler, Australian representative, Frank Johnson, and New Zealand representative, Lida Smith. Foreign friends held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners as they entered the venue. The banners, written in various languages, read: "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand!"

The rally was held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The venue was filled with a strong revolutionary fighting atmosphere. In the center of the stage stood a giant portrait of our most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao. On either side hung the national flag of the People's Republic of China and large placards with quotations from Chairman Mao. The venue was surrounded by anti-Soviet revisionism slogans and cartoons. The revolutionary rebels who attended the rally, including workers, peasants, students, cadres from various departments, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, shouted slogans, strongly protested, and angrily denounced the Soviet fascist atrocities. The venue was filled with roaring cheers, wave after wave, higher and higher.

At around one o'clock, Comrades Zhou Enlai and other leaders, representatives of the revolutionary rebels, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and responsible comrades from relevant departments of the government, as well as foreign friends, all walked onto the stage together. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in excitement, and people waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," cheering enthusiastically for a long time: "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand times ten thousand times our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao!"

The rally began with the entire venue singing "The East Is Red." People held up their copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shining with red light, and read aloud: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the U.S. imperialist aggressors in China, they will not retreat from the stage of history of their own accord." "The people of the whole world, unite! Beat back the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the whole world, be courageous, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All monsters will be annihilated."

Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke first at the rally (full text on page 2). On behalf of our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, he extended his warmest greetings to the heroic anti-revisionist fighters—the victorious returning students and comrades from the embassy in the Soviet Union—and paid revolutionary greetings to them in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

He pointed out that the series of fascist atrocities recently committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique are unprecedented in the history of world diplomacy. They are a serious provocation against the Chinese people, a great insult to the great people of the Soviet Union, and a great insult to the great Lenin.

Comrade Chen Yi said that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is a small group of traitors to Marxism-Leninism, the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Their actions do not represent the broad masses of the Soviet people. The Soviet people are a great people with a glorious revolutionary tradition. They are revolutionary and want to be friends with the Chinese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique attempts to sabotage the revolutionary friendship between the two peoples of China and the Soviet Union, but the result will only be that they lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet.

Comrade Chen Yi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by shouts of slogans. People raised their arms and shouted: "Firmly support our country's solemn statement!" "Strongest protest against the Soviet revisionists' violation of our sovereignty!" "Strongest protest against the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!"

Representatives of the revolutionary rebels from various sectors in the capital and representatives of the Red Guards in the capital spoke one after another at the rally. They angrily denounced the heinous anti-China crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, highly praised the diplomatic personnel of our embassy in the Soviet Union and the students for their fearless and unyielding struggle against the Soviet fascist thugs, for defending our great motherland's sovereignty and dignity with their blood, and for being worthy sons and daughters of the Chinese people and good students and cadres of Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to learn from them. They said:

"We, the revolutionary rebels, firmly support the statement issued by our government on February 5. We once again warn the Soviet revisionist ruling clique headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin: The serious demands put forward in our government's statement must be carried out, not one bit less! Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this must be fully borne by you!"

"Listen, you heads of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique: We Red Guards are fearless, fearing neither heaven nor earth, daring to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire. What big thing can scare us? Do you think we are afraid of you, a small group of U.S. imperialist lackeys? If you insist on confronting the Chinese people, then go ahead! Show us what you've got! Chairman Mao said: 'Sweep away all harmful insects, no enemies.' This is our oath. We will definitely make a big fuss against imperialism, capitalism, revisionism, and all old systems, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal."

"Currently, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is rampantly anti-China, but this is only a temporary phenomenon, a sign of their dying struggle. 'Darkness is about to pass, and dawn is just ahead.' The Soviet people, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, are the ones who truly deserve to be the masters of the Soviet state! We firmly believe that one day, the Soviet people will hold high the great banner of Leninism, make a big fuss against the traitors of Leninism, remove their officials, dismiss their jobs, and seize their power! In the great land of Lenin, the sun of Marxism-Leninism's victory will surely rise!"

After the representatives of the revolutionary rebels and the Red Guards spoke, the entire venue shouted: "Soviet revisionism is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism! Oppose imperialism, oppose revisionism!" "Head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!"

The injured diplomatic personnel of the embassy in the Soviet Union, Wang Jianqing, Wang Guhai, and Wang Zhaoxian, could not attend the rally due to their injuries. Their written speeches were read at the rally. Representatives of the returning students also spoke at the rally. In their speeches, they represented all the diplomatic personnel of our embassy in the Soviet Union and all the returning students, enthusiastically shouting and respectfully wishing our most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

The three diplomatic personnel said in their written speeches:

"All our comrades in the embassy always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' Remembering the entrustment of 700 million people, to protect the photo of our beloved leader, Chairman Mao, to protect the dignity of our great motherland, and to protect the great Mao Zedong Thought, our comrades stood fearlessly before the Soviet revisionist thugs and fought on, night and day, guarding the embassy and foiling the thugs' disturbances time and time again."

"The Soviet leaders dared to commit unprecedented crimes, one after another, manufacturing anti-China bloodshed incidents, and worsening relations between the two countries step by step. This is because the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world love the great leader, Chairman Mao, and love the beacon of the revolutionary people of the world, Mao Zedong Thought; where the light of Mao Zedong Thought shines, there is revolution and victory. This is because, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and our great leader, Chairman Mao, the Chinese people hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, standing at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and have waged the most resolute struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. This is because the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader, Chairman Mao, aims to uproot the roots of revisionism and eliminate the soil for the restoration of capitalism in China. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has swept across the entire country and shaken the world, dealing a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism."

"We report to the people of our motherland: The facts we have seen and heard in the Soviet Union show that the Soviet people love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Despite the fact that the Soviet leaders implement fascist rule and strictly forbid the Soviet people from contacting us, the Soviet people still express their friendly feelings towards the Chinese people in various possible ways. Many Soviet revolutionary people write to us, expressing their respect for Chairman Mao and their longing for China. They say that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the hope for saving their motherland."

"Chairman Mao said: 'The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and it will definitely be victorious, whether sooner or later.' This is an unshakable truth. No matter how the Soviet revisionist ruling clique suppresses the Soviet people, or how they desperately resist the influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, spreading anti-China propaganda, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will inevitably defeat revisionism, and the Soviet people will inevitably rise up in revolution. We firmly believe that the day when the Soviet revolutionary people clean up the Soviet revisionist traitors and sweep this pile of garbage out of the Kremlin will not be far away. A bright red socialist new Soviet Union will definitely emerge. The future world will definitely be a world illuminated by the sun of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!"

In their speeches, the student representatives angrily exposed the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's heinous crimes of bloodily suppressing our students who went to lay wreaths at the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum on January 25. He said: "We were not intimidated by the savage Soviet fascist thugs. We have the red-shining 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' in our hands and the most red, most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts. We fear neither heaven nor earth, neither ghosts nor gods, so why should we fear those fascist thugs? We held our heads high, stood tall, and linked arms, loudly reciting the highest directive: 'Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' The voice of Chairman Mao terrified this group of thugs, making them tremble with fear and lose their souls. They crazily rushed towards our ranks, trying to snatch the Chairman Mao badges and the revolutionary people's treasure, 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' from our chests. We were furious to the extreme. The Chairman Mao badges and 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' are a thousand times, ten thousand times more important than our lives. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We would rather die than give up Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever dares to insult our great leader, Chairman Mao, and whoever dares to oppose the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we will never agree! We fearlessly snatched back the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' that they had snatched away, and we held the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' even tighter to our chests, shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times ten thousand!' a thousand times, ten thousand times!"

"In the Soviet Union, a series of shocking anti-China bloodshed incidents occurred, which were not accidental but were carefully planned and deliberately manufactured by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. Brezhnev and Kosygin are the masterminds behind this anti-China farce. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's fascist atrocities show that they are extremely afraid of the truth, extremely afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and extremely afraid of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, it fully shows that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has placed itself on an equal footing with the most barbaric imperialist countries and the most brutal fascist countries."

"Chairman Mao said: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' These reactionary elements in the Soviet revisionist camp will also not deviate from this logic. No matter how they play new tricks, they will not escape the punishment of history. The more they make trouble, the more miserable they will fail, and the faster they will perish."

The loyalty and bravery of the anti-revisionist fighters, their spirit of fighting bravely, greatly inspired and educated the revolutionary rebel fighters. During their speeches, people repeatedly shouted: "Salute to the heroic anti-revisionist fighters!" "Send warm greetings to the injured comrades!" "Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The rally issued a telegram, angrily denouncing the Soviet fascist atrocities.

At the end of the rally, more than ten thousand revolutionary rebel troops sang "The Internationale" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in unison, and the entire venue shouted again: "Workers of the world, unite! Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Long live the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times ten thousand!"

After the rally ended, the revolutionary rebel troops, holding countless red flags, marched in a grand procession towards the gates of the Soviet embassy in China.

"Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." In front of the Soviet embassy, the roaring shouts of "Down with U.S. imperialism, down with Soviet revisionism!" "Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified!" "Soviet revisionism must pay the blood debt!" "Soviet revisionism's anti-China actions will not end well!" echoed like thunder, shaking the heavens and the earth. (Accompanying pictures)

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    首都十万革命造反派和革命群众集会声讨苏修领导集团
    周恩来陈伯达康生陈毅江青等同志和五大洲的国际友人出席大会
    大会严正警告苏修统治集团：我国政府声明提出的严正要求，你们必须照办，差一点也不行。我们说话是算数的。一切与中国人民为敌的反动派，都决不会有好下场！
    据新华社十一日讯　首都十万多革命造反派和各界革命群众，今天举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，再一次严正警告苏修统治集团：我国政府声明提出的严正要求，你们必须照办，差一点也不行。我们说话是算数的。一切与中国人民为敌的反动派，都决不会有好下场！
    正在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的首都无产阶级革命派，今天结成浩浩荡荡的大军，怀着满腔的怒火，最最强烈抗议苏修统治集团血腥镇压我留欧学生，组织暴徒闯入我驻苏大使馆，侵犯我国主权，殴打我外交工作人员。他们在集会和示威游行的时候代表七亿中国人民发出誓言：伟大的中国人民一定更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，用无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利来回击苏联修正主义的猖狂进攻；同世界革命人民一道，把反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！
    从一月二十五日苏修当局制造红场流血事件以来，随着苏修当局变本加厉地制造反华暴行，首都广大革命造反派和革命群众在半个多月中，有二百多万人涌向苏联驻中国大使馆门前，连续举行了强大的示威游行，愤怒声讨苏修当局接二连三地制造骇人听闻的反华流血事件、蓄意恶化中苏两国关系的滔天罪行。
    中央领导同志周恩来、陈伯达、康生、陈毅、江青等，出席了今天举行的首都革命造反派愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行大会。
    在北京的来自世界五大洲的国际友人出席了今天的大会。他们当中有：亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，美国著名黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表助理蒙空·纳那空，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，日本人士西园寺公一，印度尼西亚人士威利、伊萨，苏丹人士凯尔，美国人士艾德勒，澳大利亚人士弗兰克·约翰逊，新西兰人士丽达·史密斯等。外国朋友来到会场时，高举毛主席画像和标语牌。标语牌上用各种文字写着：“打倒苏修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    大会在北京工人体育场举行。会场上充满了强烈的革命战斗气氛。主席台正中高竖我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像，两侧挂着中华人民共和国国旗和大幅毛主席语录牌。会场四周布满了反对苏修的标语和漫画。参加大会的革命造反派工人、农民、学生、机关干部和人民解放军指战员，高呼口号，强烈抗议和愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行。会场上，激昂的吼声此起彼伏，一浪高过一浪。
    一时许，周恩来等领导同志、革命造反派代表、人民解放军和政府有关部门的负责人，以及外国朋友，一同走上主席台。这时，全场沸腾，人们挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，长时间地热烈欢呼：“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    大会开始后，全场高唱《东方红》。人们手捧红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》齐声朗读：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志首先在大会上讲话（全文见第二版）。他代表我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委和中央文化革命小组，向英勇的反修战士们——胜利归来的留学生和驻苏联大使馆的同志们，表示最亲切的慰问，并向他们致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗的敬礼。
    他指出，苏联修正主义领导集团最近连续干出的世界外交史上罕见的法西斯暴行，是对中国人民的严重挑衅，是对伟大苏联人民的莫大侮辱，对伟大列宁的莫大侮辱。
    陈毅同志说，苏联修正主义领导集团只是一小撮马克思列宁主义的叛徒，是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。他们的所作所为，根本不能代表广大的苏联人民。苏联人民是具有光荣革命传统的伟大人民，他们是要革命的，是要同中国人民友好的。苏联修正主义领导集团妄图破坏中苏两国人民的革命友谊，其结果，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。
    陈毅同志的讲话不断被口号声所打断。人们振臂高呼：“坚决拥护我国政府的严正声明！”“最最强烈抗议苏修侵犯我国主权！”“最最强烈抗议苏修的法西斯暴行！”“中苏两国人民的友谊万岁！”
    首都各界革命造反派代表和首都红卫兵代表先后在大会上发言，他们愤怒声讨苏修统治集团犯下的反华滔天罪行，热烈赞扬我国驻苏大使馆外交工作人员和留学生不畏强暴，临危不惧，对苏修法西斯暴徒进行了英勇不屈的斗争，用鲜血捍卫了我们伟大祖国的主权和尊严，赞扬他们不愧为中国人民的好儿女，毛主席的好学生、好干部，表示一定要好好向他们学习。他们说：
      “我们革命造反派，最最坚决地支持我国政府二月五日的声明。我们再一次警告以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏联修正主义统治集团：我国政府在声明中提出的严正要求，你们必须照办，差一点儿也不行！否则，由此产生的一切严重后果，你们必须负完全责任！”
      “苏修统治集团的头子们听着：我们红卫兵战士天不怕，地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，什么庞然大物也吓不倒我们，难道还怕你们这一小撮美帝的爪牙吗？如果你们一定要和中国人民较量的话，那就请便吧！有什么本事，你们统统使出来吧！毛主席说：‘要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。’这就是我们红卫兵的誓言。我们就是要大造帝国主义的反，大造资本主义、修正主义的反，大造一切旧制度的反，不达目的，决不罢休。”
      “目前苏修统治集团大肆反华，猖獗一时，这只是暂时的现象，是他们垂死的挣扎。‘黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。’有着十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，他们才有资格做苏维埃国家真正的主人！我们坚信，总有一天，苏联人民会高高举起列宁主义的伟大旗帜，大造列宁主义的叛徒的反，罢他们的官，撤他们的职，夺他们的权！在伟大列宁的故乡，必将升起马克思列宁主义胜利的曙光！”
    革命造反派代表和红卫兵代表讲话以后，全场高呼：“苏修是美帝的头号帮凶！反帝必反修！”“头可断、血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！”
    回国的我驻苏使馆外交工作人员王荩卿、王贵海、王钊贤因重伤未能出席大会。大会上宣读了他们的书面发言。归国留学生代表也在大会上发言。他们在发言中代表我国驻苏联大使馆全体工作人员和全体归国留学生，热烈欢呼，敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    三位外交工作人员在书面发言中说：
      “我们全馆同志时刻记着毛主席的教导：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’记着七亿人民的嘱托，为了保卫我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的照片，保卫伟大祖国的尊严，保卫伟大的毛泽东思想，我们的同志在苏修暴徒面前，毫无惧色，坚持斗争，夜以继日地守卫着大使馆，一次又一次地粉碎了暴徒的捣乱。”
      “苏修头目们竟敢冒天下之大不韪，一次又一次地制造反华流血事件，一步比一步更加严重地破坏中苏两国的关系，这是因为，中国和世界革命人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，无限热爱世界革命人民的指路明灯毛泽东思想；毛泽东思想的光辉照到哪里，哪里就革命，就胜利。这是因为，中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和我们的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命大旗，站在反帝反修斗争的最前列，向帝修反进行了最坚决的斗争。这是因为，伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，要挖掉修正主义的根子，要铲除资本主义在中国复辟的土壤。这场无产阶级文化大革命，席卷了全中国，也震撼了全世界，严重打击了帝国主义和现代修正主义。”
      “我们在这里向祖国人民报告：我们在苏联耳闻目见的大量事实表明，苏联人民热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，苏联人民强烈地要求同中国人民友好。尽管苏修头子们实行法西斯统治，严禁苏联人民同我们接触，但是，苏联人民还是通过种种可能的方式，向我们表达他们对中国人民的友好感情。许多苏联革命人民写信给我们，表达他们对毛主席的崇敬和对中国的向往。他们说，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是拯救他们祖国的希望。”
    “毛主席说：‘社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。’这是颠扑不破的真理。不管苏修统治集团怎样压制苏联人民，也不管他们怎样疯狂抵制我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，拚命地进行反华煽动，马列主义、毛泽东思想终究要战胜修正主义，苏联人民终究要起来革命。我们坚信：苏联革命人民起来收拾苏修叛徒，挥起铁扫帚把这堆垃圾从克里姆林宫里彻底清除出去的日子不会很久了。一个红彤彤的社会主义的新苏联必将出现。未来的天下，一定是马列主义、毛泽东思想阳光照耀的天下！”
    留学生代表在发言中愤怒控诉了苏修统治集团一月二十五日在红场上血腥镇压向列宁斯大林墓敬献花圈的我留学生的滔天罪行。他说：“我们在野蛮的苏修法西斯暴徒面前没有被吓倒。我们手中有红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，心中有最红最红最红的红太阳毛主席。我们天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕，难道还怕他们那些法西斯暴徒吗？我们昂起头，挺起胸，手挽着手，高声背诵最高指示：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’毛主席的声音吓得这一群暴徒惊恐万状，魂不附体。他们疯狂地向我们的队伍扑来，企图抢走我们胸前的毛主席像章和世界革命人民的宝书《毛主席语录》。我们愤怒到了极点。毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》比我们的生命重要千倍万倍，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。谁敢侮辱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，谁敢反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们坚决不答应！我们奋不顾身地把被他们抢走的《毛主席语录》坚决夺了回来，我们把《毛主席语录》更紧更紧地贴在胸口，一千次、一万次地高呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
      “在苏联，一系列骇人听闻的反华流血事件的发生，决不是偶然的，完全是苏修统治集团精心策划和蓄意制造的。勃列日涅夫和柯西金就是导演这场反华丑剧的罪魁祸首。苏修统治集团的法西斯暴行说明，他们极端害怕真理，极端害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，极端害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命。同时也充分表明，苏修统治集团已经把自己置于最野蛮的帝国主义国家和最残暴的法西斯国家的同等地位。”
      “毛主席说：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’苏修这些反动家伙，也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。无论他们怎样玩弄新的花招，也决不能逃脱历史对他们的惩罚。他们越捣乱，就失败得越惨，就灭亡得越快。”
    反修战士们忠于毛主席的赤胆红心，他们进行英勇斗争的精神，给了革命造反派战士极大的鼓舞和教育，在他们讲话过程中，人们不断高呼：“向英勇的反修战士致敬！”“向受伤的战友致以亲切的慰问！”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    大会发出通电，愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行。
    大会结束时，十万多革命造反大军齐声高唱《国际歌》、《大海航行靠舵手》，全场再次高呼：“全世界无产者联合起来，打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    大会结束后，革命造反派大军高举无数面红旗，浩浩荡荡地直奔苏联驻中国大使馆门前。
      “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”在苏联大使馆门前，“打倒美帝，打倒苏修！”“革命无罪，造反有理！”“苏修必须偿还血债！”“苏修反华决没有好下场！”的愤怒吼声，如风雷激荡，震天动地。（附图片）
