Japanese friends have expressed their enthusiastic support for the struggle of China's revolutionary rebels for great unity and great power seizure. They have hailed the victory of China's revolutionary rebels in seizing power as inspiring and have condemned Japanese revisionists for attacking the Red Guards in collusion with Soviet revisionists.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, Japanese friends have spoken to Chinese journalists, enthusiastically hailing the seizure of power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have pointed out that this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

A standing committee member of the Yamanaishi Prefecture (orthodox) branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Shinmiya Kei, said that the current characteristic of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries and the seizure of power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Shinmiya Kei said that the editorial in the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine scientifically expounds the great significance of the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries based on the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Shinmiya Kei said that this power seizure struggle is a mass movement from the bottom up, personally initiated and supported by Chairman Mao. This shows Chairman Mao's full trust in the broad revolutionary masses. He said that this struggle embodies Chairman Mao's famous statement: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history."

Shinmiya Kei said that the seizure of power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road by the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries is to establish a completely new and full-of-vitality government apparatus that suits the socialist economic base. He said that this is a major development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao, indicating that Mao Zedong Thought has reached a completely new stage.

Shinmiya Kei said that the Chinese people have mastered Mao Zedong Thought and have continuously achieved new successes in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. This is a very remarkable thing. He expressed his determination to study Mao Zedong Thought even better in the future.

A leader of a revolutionary youth organization in Yamaguchi Prefecture said that he fully supports the power seizure struggle launched by the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, Shanxi, and other places against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. He said that this is a great revolution under the condition of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

He said that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. The Chinese proletariat, with the momentum of a surging tide and the force of thunder, seizes power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, which is a highly satisfying event.

This Japanese youth also strongly condemned a handful of Japanese revisionists for tearing off their masks and using the *Akahata* newspaper to attack the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, attacking the great Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He said that the despicable behavior of these Japanese revisionists is to provide cover for a handful of power-holders within the Chinese Party who are taking the capitalist road.

A union worker said that the Japanese people sincerely wish for the success of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, making China an even stronger socialist country.

He angrily condemned the *Akahata* newspaper, which is under the control of Japanese revisionists, for recently writing articles in a hurry to attack the Chinese Red Guards and the great Chairman Mao. He pointed out that this newspaper has become the vanguard of anti-China forces and is now in cahoots with the *Pravda* newspaper of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

A technician in Tokyo enthusiastically praised the fighting spirit of the great unity, thorough revolution, and rebellion to the end of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries. He pointed out that Chairman Mao said: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" This sentence is now deeply imprinted in the minds of the revolutionary people of Japan.

A printer in Tokyo said that under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries carry out great unity nationwide and seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is a new development of the Paris Commune experience.

He said that the People's Liberation Army of China, created by Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supports the revolutionary rebels, which is completely correct.

He said that after the proletarian revolutionaries seize power, they certainly cannot use the old set of state machinery. The Chinese proletarian revolutionaries will definitely smash all the old state machinery and establish a completely new form of government that serves the people.

An activist involved in the Japan-China friendship movement said: I fully support the revolutionary actions of the Chinese revolutionary rebels in carrying out great unity and power seizure struggle under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. He said that this once again proves that Chairman Mao's teaching that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" is an absolute truth.

He said that the great victory of the billion revolutionary masses of China in carrying out great unity and launching a comprehensive power seizure struggle has greatly inspired the struggle of the Japanese people. This victory has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and has greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

He highly praised the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao in developing and enriching Marxism-Leninism in a brilliant, creative, and comprehensive way. He sincerely wishes Chairman Mao longevity.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯　日本朋友向中国记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权好得很！并且指出，这是毛泽东思想的新的胜利。
    日中友好协会山梨县（正统）总部常任理事神宫寺敬说，当前中国无产阶级文化大革命的特点是无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权。这是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的一场你死我活的斗争。
    神宫寺敬说，《红旗》杂志第三期社论，根据伟大的毛泽东思想科学地阐明了无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争的伟大意义。
    神宫寺敬说，这场夺权斗争是毛主席亲自号召和支持的一次自下而上的群众运动，这是毛主席对广大革命群众的充分信赖。他说，这一斗争体现了毛主席关于“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这一著名的论断。
    神宫寺敬说，中国无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权，是为了建立适应社会主义经济基础的完全崭新的充满生命力的政权机构。他说，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的重大发展，它表明毛泽东思想发展到了一个完全崭新的阶段。
    神宫寺敬说，中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，并在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中不断取得了新的成就，这是一件很了不起的事情。他表示今后要更好地学习毛泽东思想。
    山口县革命青年组织的一位领导人表示，完全支持上海、山西等地的革命造反派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开的夺权斗争。他说，这是一场在无产阶级专政条件下的伟大革命。
    他说，革命的根本问题是政权问题。中国的无产阶级以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权，是大快人心的事。
    这位日本青年还强烈谴责日本一小撮修正主义分子撕下假面具，利用《赤旗报》攻击史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，攻击伟大的毛主席和毛泽东思想。他说，日本的修正主义分子的这种丑恶行为是在为中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打掩护。
    一个工会工作干部说，日本人民衷心祝愿中国无产阶级文化大革命获得成功，使中国成为更加强大的社会主义国家。
    他愤怒谴责在日本修正主义分子控制下的《赤旗报》最近迫不及待地写文章攻击中国红卫兵，攻击伟大的毛主席。他接着指出，这家报纸充当了反对中国的急先锋，已经同苏联修正主义统治集团的《真理报》一个鼻孔出气了。
    东京的一位技术工人热情颂扬中国无产阶级革命派大联合、彻底革命、一反到底的战斗精神。他指出，毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”这句话，现在已经深深地印在日本革命人民的脑海里了。
    东京的一位印刷工人说，在毛主席亲自发动和领导下的中国无产阶级革命派实行大联合，在全国范围内向一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权，这是巴黎公社经验的新发展。
    他说，毛主席缔造的、以毛泽东思想武装的中国人民解放军，坚决支持革命造反派，是完全正确的。
    他说，无产阶级革命派夺权之后，当然不能沿用旧的一套国家机器。中国无产阶级革命派定将打碎一切旧的国家机器，建立一套完全为人民服务的、崭新的政权形式。
    从事日中友好运动的一位活动家说：我完全支持中国革命造反派在毛主席的英明领导下实行大联合进行夺权斗争的革命行动。他说，这再次证明毛主席指出“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”的教导，是千真万确的真理。
    他说，中国亿万革命群众实行大联合，展开全面夺权斗争的伟大胜利，极大地鼓舞了日本人民的斗争。这个胜利大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的威风。
    他高度赞扬伟大领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义的丰功伟绩。他衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。
