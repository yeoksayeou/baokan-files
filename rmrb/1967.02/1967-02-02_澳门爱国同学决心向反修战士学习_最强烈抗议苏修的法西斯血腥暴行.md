Macao patriotic students have resolved to learn from anti-revisionist fighters and strongly protest the fascist bloody atrocities of the Soviet revisionists.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on February 1, the brutal suppression of Chinese students studying in Europe by the Soviet revisionist leadership has aroused the extreme indignation of Macao students who had bravely fought against Portuguese imperialism at the "Governor's Mansion." On January 31, the Macao Chinese Students' Federation sent a telegram to the persecuted Chinese students in Europe, strongly protesting the fascist bloody atrocities of the Soviet revisionists and expressing sincere condolences and high respect to the brave anti-revisionist fighters.

The telegram said, "In the heart of modern revisionism, you have resonated with the strongest tones of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet revisionist bastards were terrified by your revolutionary actions, deploying large numbers of military police and plainclothes agents to brutally suppress you. In the most critical moment, you remembered the highest directive: 'Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' You bravely fought against them, vowing to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our motherland and to defend Mao Zedong Thought! You are Chairman Mao's good students, and you are our good examples. We learn from you and salute you!"

The telegram said, "The fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist bastards have once again exposed their traitorous faces to the world. The patriotic students in Macao are filled with rage, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist bastards!"

The telegram said, "Recently, Portuguese imperialism brutally suppressed and massacred our Chinese compatriots in Macao. All patriotic compatriots in Macao united as one, with a common hatred for the enemy, raised the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely fought for more than two months, achieving a comprehensive victory!"
