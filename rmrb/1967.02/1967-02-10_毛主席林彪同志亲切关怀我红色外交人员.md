The three comrades from our embassy in the Soviet Union, who were severely beaten by the Soviet revisionist thugs, returned to Beijing.

Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao carefully concern themselves with our red diplomats. Comrade Chen Yi and thousands of revolutionary masses and friends from various countries in the capital went to the airport to welcome them and held a grand welcoming ceremony.

Representatives of the revolutionary rebels and anti-revisionist fighters in the capital expressed: We will resolutely fight the Soviet revisionist ruling clique to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: "Welcome, welcome the red diplomatic workers of Chairman Mao returning victorious! Salute, salute to the glorious anti-revisionist fighters!" To defend the photos of our great leader Chairman Mao and the exhibition cases, the three comrades from our embassy in the Soviet Union, Wang Jianqing and others, who were beaten by the Soviet revisionist thugs and suffered severe injuries, broke through the numerous obstacles set by the Soviet revisionist authorities and returned to our beloved motherland today in the afternoon by special plane, returning to the side of our most beloved great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council, Comrade Chen Yi, revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses from various circles in the capital numbering in the thousands went to the capital airport to welcome them. Comrade Chen Yi, on behalf of Chairman Mao, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, expressed heartfelt greetings to Comrade Wang Jianqing and others, and praised them for fighting bravely. Comrade Wang Jianqing and others, with tears of joy, excitedly said: "Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you for Chairman Mao's concern! Thank you for the concern of the people of our motherland!"

Revolutionary masses in the capital and revolutionary friends from 27 countries, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and large banners, held a grand welcoming ceremony at the airport. The meeting strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's continuous creation of anti-China incidents and violation of international relations norms, and once again warned the Soviet revisionist ruling clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin: The solemn demands put forward by the Chinese government in the February 5th statement must be followed item by item. If not, all consequences arising from this must be fully borne by you.

Today, the capital airport was adorned with red flags. Around 2:00 PM, the special plane carrying the red diplomatic fighters landed at the airport amidst cheers. Second Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Comrade Wang Jianqing, and embassy staff members Comrade Wang Zhuoxian and Comrade Wang Guihai, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, were escorted down from the plane by medical personnel. At this moment, the welcoming crowd waved the red-lit "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting: "Strongest protest against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists! Unite the people of China and the Soviet Union, overthrow the Soviet revisionist ruling clique! Salute to the heroic anti-revisionist fighters! Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!"

Foreign friends also joined Chinese comrades in waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting: "Learn from Chairman Mao's red anti-revisionist fighters! Warmly welcome the return of Chinese heroic anti-revisionist fighters! Down with American imperialism! Down with modern revisionism!"

The welcoming ceremony began with the orchestra playing "The East Is Red." The crowd recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries toward the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic. Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly be victorious, whether it is early or late."

The representative of the revolutionary rebels in the capital spoke first, enthusiastically praising our red diplomatic fighters who, in the heart of Moscow, the center of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly sacrificed, overcame all difficulties, and carried out a struggle of principle against a handful of Soviet revisionist traitors. He said, you defended the sovereignty and dignity of the motherland with your blood, defended the great Mao Zedong Thought. You are models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. You are truly loyal red diplomatic workers of Chairman Mao. You are our good examples to learn from!

He said, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has uprooted revisionism and eliminated the soil for the restoration of capitalism in China. The Soviet revisionists hate socialist China to the core and are terrified of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They collude with imperialism and reactionaries in various countries to slander and attack China, repeatedly stirring up anti-China waves, and taking a series of steps to worsen Sino-Soviet relations. He said, we revolutionary rebels firmly support the statement of our government! We want to warn the Soviet revisionist ruling clique again, the patience of the Chinese people has its limits. The great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with! All anti-China elements will definitely meet a bad end!

He said, today, the great people of the Soviet Union are bravely fighting against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The great people of the Soviet Union are our close comrades-in-arms. We revolutionary rebels, we 700 million Chinese people, firmly stand on the side of the Soviet people! We are convinced that the revolutionary struggle of the Soviet people will certainly achieve final victory.

At the meeting, the written speech of the anti-revisionist fighters was read. The speech said, when we just landed on the soil of the motherland, our happiness and gratitude were indescribable. We have thousands of words in our hearts to say. We want to shout first: Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our most, most, most, most great leader Chairman Mao!

The written speech of the anti-revisionist fighters denounced the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's continuous creation of anti-China incidents and violation of international relations norms, and introduced their heroic struggle to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought. The speech pointed out that the fascist banditry of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique once again proved that they have long since completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism. They are terrified of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The speech said, Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The embassy comrades remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and are carrying out a struggle of principle against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. When we returned to the country, all the comrades in the embassy repeatedly instructed us to convey to our compatriots that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, and are determined to maintain the dignity of the motherland and fight the Soviet revisionist ruling clique to the end.

After the meeting, everyone sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "The Internationale" in unison.

Before leaving Moscow to return to the country, the embassy held a grand farewell ceremony for our red diplomatic workers. Deputy Chief of Mission An Zhiyuan said in his speech, please convey to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland that the comrades we leave behind guarantee to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end. We will definitely not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. Chairman Mao taught us: "This army has a spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice. It will defeat all enemies and will never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight." Chairman Mao's teachings are our guiding principles for future actions. The representative of the embassy staff said in his speech, the comrades we leave in Moscow are all full of fighting spirit. Our pledge is: with determination, fearless of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, to strive for the complete victory of the anti-revisionist struggle. We will die as the most loyal red anti-revisionist fighters of Chairman Mao.

    被苏修暴徒殴打重伤的我驻苏使馆三位同志回到北京
    毛主席林彪同志亲切关怀我红色外交人员
    陈毅同志和首都数千革命群众、各国朋友到机场迎接并隆重举行欢迎大会
    首都革命造反派代表和反修战士表示：坚决同苏修统治集团斗争到底
    新华社九日讯　“欢迎，欢迎毛主席的红色外交工作人员胜利归来！”“致敬，向光荣的反修战士致敬！”为保卫我们伟大领袖毛主席的照片和展览橱窗，被苏修暴徒殴打身受重伤的我国驻苏联大使馆外交工作人员王荩卿等三位同志，冲破苏修当局设下的重重障碍，今天下午乘专机胜利回到亲爱的祖国，回到我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的身边。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅同志，首都革命造反派和各界革命群众数千人前往首都机场迎接。陈毅同志代表毛主席、林彪同志和周恩来同志，向王荩卿等同志表示亲切的慰问，并表扬他们斗争得很英勇。王荩卿等同志含着热泪，激动地说：“感谢毛主席，感谢毛主席的关怀！感谢祖国人民的关怀！”
    首都革命群众和来自二十七个国家的革命朋友，高举毛主席画像和巨幅标语，在机场上隆重举行了欢迎大会。大会强烈谴责苏修统治集团连续制造反华事件和破坏国际关系准则的滔天罪行，并且再一次警告以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修统治集团：我国政府在二月五日声明中提出的严正要求，你们必须逐条照办，如不照办，由此产生的一切后果，必须由你们负完全责任。
    今天，首都机场红旗飘扬。下午二时许，红色外交战士们乘坐的专机在一片欢呼声中降落在机场上。我驻苏使馆二等秘书王荩卿同志，使馆工作人员王钊贤和王贵海同志，手捧毛主席像，由医护人员搀扶着走下飞机。这时，欢迎的人们挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“最最强烈抗议苏修的法西斯暴行！”“中苏两国人民团结起来，打倒苏修统治集团！”“向英雄的反修战士致敬！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”陈毅等同志走到飞机旁，同王荩卿等同志亲切握手。首都革命造反派红卫兵，给王荩卿等同志戴上“反修红卫兵”袖章。
    外国朋友们也同中国同志一道，挥动着《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“向毛主席的红色反修战士学习！”“热烈欢迎中国英雄反修战士归来！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”
    欢迎大会开始，乐队奏《东方红》。人们齐声朗诵毛主席语录：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    首都革命造反派代表首先讲话，热烈赞扬我红色外交战士在苏修统治集团的中心莫斯科，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，不怕牺牲，排除万难，对一小撮苏修叛徒进行了针锋相对的斗争。他说，你们用自己的鲜血捍卫了祖国的主权和尊严，捍卫了伟大的毛泽东思想。你们是活学活用毛主席著作的模范。你们不愧为忠于毛主席的红色外交工作人员。你们是我们学习的好榜样！
    他说，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，挖了修正主义的根子，铲除了资本主义在中国复辟的土壤。苏修对社会主义中国恨之入骨，对伟大的毛泽东思想怕得要命。他们与帝国主义和各国反动派串通一气，对中国进行疯狂的诬蔑和攻击，一再掀起反华的黑浪，采取了一系列恶化中苏两国关系的步骤。他说，我们革命造反派，最最坚决地支持我国政府的声明！我们要再一次警告苏修统治集团，中国人民的克制是有限度的，伟大的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，不是好惹的！一切反华的人，绝对不会有好下场！
    他说，今天，伟大的苏联人民正在对苏修统治集团进行着英勇的斗争。伟大的苏联人民是我们的亲密战友。我们革命造反派，我们七亿中国人民，坚决站在苏联人民一边！我们坚信，苏联人民的革命斗争一定要取得最后胜利。
    在大会上，宣读了反修战士们的书面讲话。讲话说，当我们刚刚降落在祖国土地上的时候，我们的幸福和感激心情无法用言语和笔墨形容，我们心中有千句话万句话要说，我们要最先欢呼：伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们最最最最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    反修战士们的书面讲话，控诉了苏修统治集团连续制造反华事件、破坏国际关系准则的滔天罪行，并介绍了他们为保卫伟大的毛泽东思想所进行的英勇斗争。讲话指出，苏修统治集团的法西斯强盗行径，再一次证明他们早已彻头彻尾地背叛了马列主义。他们对伟大的毛泽东思想怕得发抖，怕得要命。
    讲话说，毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”使馆同志们牢记毛主席的教导，正在同苏修统治集团进行着针锋相对的斗争。我们回国时，使馆全体同志一再叮嘱我们转告祖国亲人，他们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，决心维护祖国尊严，同苏修统治集团斗争到底。
    大会结束后，全体齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《国际歌》。
    我红色外交工作人员在离开莫斯科回国前，使馆全体同志为他们举行了盛大的欢送会。使馆临时代办安致远在讲话中说，请你们转告毛主席和祖国人民，我们留下的同志保证高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反修斗争进行到底。我们一定不会辜负伟大领袖毛主席和祖国人民对我们的期望。毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的这个教导，就是我们今后行动的指针。使馆工作人员代表在讲话中说，我们留在莫斯科的同志个个斗志昂扬，我们的誓言是：下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取反修斗争的彻底胜利。我们誓死做毛主席最忠实的红色反修战士。
