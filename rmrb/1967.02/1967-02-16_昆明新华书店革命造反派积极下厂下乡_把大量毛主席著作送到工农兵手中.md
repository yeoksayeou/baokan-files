	Kunming New China Bookstore revolutionary rebels, after seizing power from the capitalist-roaders within the party, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." Before and after the Spring Festival, they supplied over 110,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works to the broad revolutionary masses.

	To meet the urgent demand of the broad revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary rebels of Kunming New China Bookstore, before the Spring Festival, released recently printed copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and large portraits of Chairman Mao. They also took out all the tens of thousands of copies of Chairman Mao's works that had been hoarded in the warehouse by the capitalist-roaders and made them available for distribution. They appropriately increased their workforce, expanded their distribution points, and sent people to the countryside and factories to ensure good distribution work in the suburban bookstores. They also improved the supply work of the storefront. For workers and PLA soldiers recuperating in hospitals, they adopted measures such as delivering books to their doors or giving them priority in supply, ensuring that these people in the hospital get Chairman Mao's precious books first.

    昆明新华书店革命造反派积极下厂下乡
    把大量毛主席著作送到工农兵手中
    据新华社昆明电　云南省昆明市新华书店革命造反派职工从党内走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权以后，坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，在春节前后，把十一万多本毛主席著作供应给广大革命群众。
    为了满足广大革命群众学习毛主席著作的迫切要求，昆明市新华书店的革命造反派职工，春节前发行了最近印制出来的《毛泽东选集》、《毛泽东著作选读》、《毛主席语录》等毛主席著作和毛主席巨幅画像，他们还把被走资本主义道路当权派积压在仓库里的数万册毛主席著作，全部拿出来供应。他们适当增加了人力，增加了发行网点，并且派人下乡下厂，深入到郊区各书店做好发行工作。他们还改进了门市部的供应工作。对于在医院疗养的工人和解放军指战员，他们采取了送书上门或优先供应的办法，使这些在医院疗养的人尽先得到毛主席的宝书。
