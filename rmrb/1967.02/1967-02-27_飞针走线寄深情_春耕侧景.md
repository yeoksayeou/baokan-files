Title: Needles Flying, Threads Running, Emotions Deep — A Spring Plowing Scene
Author: Shì Xīn

Edition: 6

A cold spring night, the lamp is bright,
The songs have stopped, the laughter has ceased, but the heart's waves surge.
The old lady puts on her clothes and sits on the kang,
With flying needles and running threads, she busily mends and patches.

She sews on a loose button,
She patches up a torn uniform.
The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are about to rise,
Under the stars, they will busy themselves with spring plowing.

With a loving gaze, she looks at the sleeping soldiers,
With deep emotion, she gazes up at Chairman Mao's portrait.
Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!
The soldiers, carrying your instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production,"
Have illuminated our mountain valley with bright light!
What matter if there are thousands of mountains and tens of thousands of rivers in between?
You, Chairman Mao, are right here in our village!

Words of gratitude are endless,
You have nurtured our poor and lower-middle peasants' offspring,
Into capable and versatile good cadres!

The night deepens, the lamp burns brighter,
The old lady busily mends with flying needles and running threads!
Each stitch sews the gratitude of the poor and lower-middle peasants,
Each thread weaves the hopes of the poor and lower-middle peasants:
Follow Chairman Mao's words without the slightest deviation,
Carry out Chairman Mao's instructions without the slightest error.
Hold the red flag of revolution high,
Follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao without losing direction!

    飞针走线寄深情
    ——春耕侧景
    解放军海军某部　世新春寒夜深灯火明亮，歌停笑止心潮如浪，大娘披衣炕上坐，飞针走线缝补忙。缀一缀松动的纽扣，补一补刮破的军装。解放军同志快起身
  了，顶着星星就把春耕
  忙。慈祥地看着熟睡的战
  士，深情地仰望毛主席的
  彩像。毛主席啊，毛主席！子弟兵带着您“抓革
  命，促生产”的指
  示，把俺们这山沟照得通
  明火亮！哪里隔着千重山、万
  道水？您老人家就在俺庄！千言万语谢不尽啊，您把俺贫下中农的后
  生，造就成能文能武的好
  干将！夜更深，灯更亮，大娘飞针走线忙！针针缝着贫下中农的
  谢意，线线穿着贫下中农的
  热望：听毛主席的话一个字
  不打折扣，照毛主席的指示办事
  毫不走样。革命红旗举得高，走毛主席指引的大路
  不迷方向！
