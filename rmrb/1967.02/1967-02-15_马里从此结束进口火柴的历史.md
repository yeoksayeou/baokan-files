The "Lightning" match factory, built with Chinese aid in Mali, recently held a grand opening ceremony in Bamako. Mali's President Modibo Keita cut the ribbon for the factory. Over a thousand residents of Bamako celebrated the event with drums and dances, marking a new achievement in Sino-Malian friendship.

The factory was constructed under the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two governments. The factory's production capacity can meet the needs of the Malian people, thus ending Mali's history of importing matches. Previously, colonialists had claimed that matches could not be made from local wood in Mali. Through the joint efforts of technicians and workers from both China and Mali, suitable local wood for producing high-quality matches has been found in Mali.

    马里从此结束进口火柴的历史
    新华社巴马科电　中国援助马里建设的“闪电”火柴厂最近在巴马科隆重举行落成典礼。
    马里总统莫迪博·凯塔为这个工厂建成剪彩。巴马科一千多居民敲着鼓、跳着舞庆祝这一中马友谊的新成果。
    这座工厂是根据中马两国政府经济技术合作协定而建设的，这座工厂的产量能满足马里人民的需要，从此，将结束马里进口火柴的历史。从前，殖民主义者曾经说：在马里，不能用当地的木材制造火柴。由于中国和马里两国技术人员和工人的共同努力，在马里已找到了能用来制造优质火柴的当地的木材。
