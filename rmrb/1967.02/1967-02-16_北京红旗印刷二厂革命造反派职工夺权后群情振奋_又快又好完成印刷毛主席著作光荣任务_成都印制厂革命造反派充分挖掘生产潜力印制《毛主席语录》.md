The proletarian revolutionary rebels of Beijing Red Flag Printing Factory No. 2, after seizing all leadership powers from the clique of capitalism-roaders within the party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, united all revolutionary workers in the factory. They vigorously promoted revolution and production, and the revolutionary enthusiasm throughout the factory reached an unprecedented high. The production situation underwent a complete transformation, and they excellently completed the glorious task of printing Chairman Mao's works.

This year, the factory's letterpress printing target increased by 20.8 percent compared to last year. In January, they completed the task 3 percent above the target, an increase of 57.2 percent compared to the same period last year. Previously, the factory operated 13 shifts per day, but this year they increased to 16 shifts per day. The typesetting time was also reduced from 16 hours to 13 hours, ensuring that the printing task for Chairman Mao's works in January was completed 20 percent above the target and met all quality standards.

After the revolutionary rebel workers took power, they responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" with unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm. They adopted various revolutionary measures and shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production.

For over a decade, this factory had been an important stronghold for the old Beijing Municipal Committee to produce counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, such as "Night Talks of Yan Mountain," "Dismissal of Hai Rui," "Compilation of Peking Opera," "Thanks to Xiaoyuan," "Beijing Work," and "Beijing Literature." However, the printing of our great leader Chairman Mao's precious books was obstructed, harassed, and sabotaged in every way by a clique of capitalism-roaders within the party. Early this year, the factory was assigned the glorious task of printing 2 million copies of the single-volume edition of "Opposing Libertarianism." However, those bureaucrats planned to drag out the publication time to as long as three months. The revolutionary rebel workers deeply understood that great Mao Zedong Thought is the weapon, the source of strength, and the spiritual atomic bomb for the proletarian revolutionary rebels to stand up and make revolution. This single-volume edition was published to meet the urgent needs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now that the power to print Chairman Mao's works is in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary rebel workers, the time cannot be dragged out like that! They proposed with the heroic spirit of proletarian revolutionary fighters: "Complete one month ahead of schedule!" This initiative immediately received a warm response from all revolutionary masses in the factory. Everyone resolutely declared: "We can go without food, we can go without sleep, but the task of printing Chairman Mao's works cannot be delayed; we must race against time to deliver the precious books to the revolutionary masses." The revolutionary rebel workers were enthusiastic and full of fighting spirit. To publish the single-volume edition of "Opposing Libertarianism" faster, the workers also successfully experimented with the "back-grinding glue-filling binding method," increasing the binding efficiency by more than one fold.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels were determined to establish a new revolutionary order. They implemented revolutionary measures of one supervision, two mergers, and three streamlinings based on the demands of the revolutionary masses. First, they smashed the bureaucratic institutions of the management system. They changed the original three-level management system to a two-level management system and classified and merged the original departments. This reduced the number of off-duty cadres from 10 percent to 5 percent, thereby increasing the number of direct production personnel. Due to the reduction in management levels, command and dispatch became flexible, and production links became tight, thus creating an orderly new production order.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu, after the revolutionary rebel workers of Chengdu Printing Factory seized all leadership powers from the clique of capitalism-roaders within the party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, the factory quickly presented a new revolutionary situation, with production rising day by day. In just six days from January 20 to January 25, they printed more than 10,000 additional copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" compared to the original plan, and the printing of parts was completed 2,053,300 sheets above the target.

Before the seizure of power on January 20, due to the deliberate chaos created by the capitalism-roaders within the party to sabotage production, the factory had accumulated a backlog of more than 70,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and 3.5 million sheets of parts printing. Additionally, a few workers were deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and left their posts, causing production losses. After the revolutionary rebels took full control of the leadership, the situation changed fundamentally. The equipment in the letterpress workshop was relatively old, with most printing machines having been in use for 20 to 30 years, and some were even 70 to 80 years old. However, once they were in the hands of the revolutionary rebel workers, they regained their youth and unleashed tremendous potential. In the six days after the seizure of power, this workshop not only completed the daily plan above the target every day but also made up for the production tasks delayed in the previous period. The rebel workers in this workshop said: "The capitalism-roaders want to push the blame for the delayed production tasks onto us, which is a vain attempt! They also want to laugh at us after losing power, but we will make production even better."

Since the revolutionary rebels seized power, the product quality of Chengdu Printing Factory has been continuously improving, and the consumption of raw materials has significantly decreased. The seventh small group in the letterpress workshop has saved more than 3,000 sheets of paper, and the consumption standards for other auxiliary materials have also been greatly reduced.

    北京红旗印刷二厂革命造反派职工夺权后群情振奋
    又快又好完成印刷毛主席著作光荣任务
    成都印制厂革命造反派充分挖掘生产潜力印制《毛主席语录》
    本报讯　北京红旗印刷二厂无产阶级革命造反派，夺了本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的一切领导大权以后，团结全厂革命职工，大抓革命，猛促生产，全厂革命热情空前高涨，生产面貌焕然一新，出色地完成了印刷毛主席著作的光荣任务。
    今年，这个厂的铅印指标比去年提高了百分之二十点八，一月份又超额百分之三完成了任务，比去年同期提高百分之五十七点二。去年每天只开十三班，今年每天增加到十六班，上版时间也由原来的十六小时降到十三小时，从而保证一月份的毛主席著作的印刷任务超额百分之二十完成，并且全部符合质量标准。
    革命造反派职工掌握大权以后，就以无比高涨的革命热情，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，采取许多革命措施，把革命和生产两副担子挑了起来。
    十几年来，这个厂成为旧北京市委制造反革命修正主义黑货的重要据点，什么《燕山夜话》、《海瑞罢官》、《京剧汇编》、《谢瑶环》，什么《北京工作》、《北京文艺》，都是由这个厂印刷的。但是，我们伟大领袖毛主席的宝书的印刷，却遭到了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的百般阻挠、刁难和破坏。今年年初，这个厂接受了印制二百万册《反对自由主义》单行本的光荣任务，可是那些官老爷们打算把出书时间拖长到三个月之久。革命造反派职工深深懂得：伟大的毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命造反派翻身闹革命的武器、力量的源泉、精神的原子弹，这个单行本是为了配合无产阶级文化大革命的急需而出版的。现在印刷毛主席著作的大权掌握在无产阶级革命造反派职工手中，绝对不能把时间拖得那样长！他们以无产阶级革命战士的英雄气概提出：“提前一个月完成！”这一倡议立即得到全厂革命群众的热烈响应。大家坚决表示：“饭可不吃，觉可不睡，印刷毛主席著作的任务决不能延迟，要争分夺秒地把宝书送到革命群众的手里。”革命造反派职工群情振奋，斗志昂扬。为了使《反对自由主义》单行本更快出版，工人们还试验成功了“磨背灌胶装订法”，提高装订工效一倍以上。
    革命造反派掌握了领导权，一定要建立革命新秩序。他们夺权后，根据革命群众的要求，施行了一监督、二合并、三精简的革命措施。首先砸碎了管理制度的官僚机构。把原来实行的三级管理制改变成二级管理制，把原来的科室加以归类合并。这样，就使得脱产干部由原来的百分之十减少到百分之五，从而增加了直接生产人员。由于减少了管理层次，指挥调度灵活，生产衔接紧密，因此出现了一个有条不紊的生产新秩序。
    据新华社成都电　成都印制厂的革命造反派工人，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里全面夺取了工厂的领导权以后，全厂很快出现了崭新的革命局面，生产天天上升。仅从一月二十日到二十五日的六天中，就比原计划多印制了一万多本《毛主席语录》，零件印刷也超额二百零五万三千多张完成了任务。
    这个厂在一月二十日夺权以前，由于党内走资本主义道路的当权派故意制造混乱，破坏生产，全厂共拖欠了七万多本《毛主席语录》的印刷任务，零件印刷任务也拖欠了三百五十多万张。加上又有少数工人受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，离开了工作岗位，给生产造成了损失。革命造反派把领导权全面掌握到自己手里以后，情况就发生了根本变化。铅印车间的设备本来是比较陈旧的，印刷机一般都已使用了二三十年，有的还是七八十年前的老机器。但是它们一旦掌握在革命造反派工人手里，就恢复了青春，发挥了巨大的潜力。在夺权后的六天中，这个车间不仅天天超额完成日计划，而且弥补了前段时间拖欠的生产任务。这个车间的造反派工人说：“走资本主义道路的当权派要把拖欠生产任务的罪责推到我们身上，那是妄想！他们还妄想大权被夺以后，看我们的笑话，我们偏要把生产搞得好上加好。”
    自革命造反派夺权以来，成都印制厂的产品质量也不断提高，原材料消耗显著降低。铅印车间第七小组已节约用纸三千多张，其他辅料的消耗指标也大大降低。
