At a critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution when the struggle for power seizure is unfolding, the soldiers and officers of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, who have stood up to resolutely support the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary leftist masses in Guizhou Province, held a grand oath-taking rally and demonstration march on February 2 to further express their determination to fully support and assist the proletarian revolutionary rebels.

That day, the city of Guiyang was adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums and music. Squads of heroic revolutionary soldiers and groups of smiling revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, holding high the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, red flags, and placards with quotations from Chairman Mao, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and carrying large banners reading "The People's Liberation Army Resolutely Supports the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses," "Learn from the Great People's Liberation Army," and "Salute to the Great People's Liberation Army," joyfully surged into the venue.

The rally began amidst thunderous cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao" and the sound of salute cannons. Approximately 100,000 military personnel and civilians in attendance recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison, sang "The East Is Red," and paid tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao. He Guanyu, Commander of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region, read out the Central Committee's decision on the People's Liberation Army's resolute support for the revolutionary leftist masses. Shi Xin'an, Political Commissar of the Provincial Military Region, delivered a speech. He said: At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of power seizure and class struggle is unfolding nationwide, our great commander Chairman Mao has issued a battle cry to the entire army to actively support the broad leftist masses. This wise decision speaks to our hearts. We will most resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and most resolutely support and assist the proletarian revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionary masses in Guizhou, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have seized the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders in the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Committee, Guiyang Municipal Party Committee, and Municipal People's Committee over party, government, financial, and cultural affairs. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought in our province! It is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This power seizure is good, very good! We will most resolutely support the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Guizhou, and forever stand together with our comrades in the proletarian revolutionary masses of Guizhou, fight together under the red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve victory together. We vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Soldiers from the military region who are active in studying Chairman Mao's works, Zong Renxian, Tang Hexuan, and Tian Ruzhong, spoke one after another, expressing their unanimous support for and resolute implementation of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest battle cry. They vowed to support and assist the proletarian revolutionary masses with actual actions. They declared, "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, we dare to climb the knife mountain, and we dare to leap into the fire sea. We will resolutely make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and create new merits for the people."

A representative from the Guizhou Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters spoke at the rally, highly praising the soldiers and officers of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region for resolutely responding to the battle cry of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao in the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary rebels. They closely coordinated with the power seizure actions of the revolutionary rebels, timely and resolutely suppressed a handful of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, ensuring the smooth progress and great victory of the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels. He expressed that no matter what storms and waves lie ahead, we will join hands with the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, unite, fight side by side, and march forward together!

Revolutionary students from other places who came to Guiyang for revolutionary exchanges also spoke at the meeting, expressing their warm congratulations to the rally.

After the speeches, all the soldiers and officers took a solemn oath to the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and to the 17 million revolutionary people of Guizhou Province, expressing their resolute response to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao and their resolute support for the proletarian revolutionary masses. The rally also passed a telegram of tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao.

After the rally, a powerful demonstration march was held. Led by the troops of the Provincial Military Region, the marchers advanced with vigorous steps, forming a mighty procession. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses rushed to the streets, cheering along the route. The cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years" echoed throughout the mountain city of Guiyang.
