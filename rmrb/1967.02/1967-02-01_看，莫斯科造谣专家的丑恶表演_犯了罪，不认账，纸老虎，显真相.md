After the "January 25" incident where the Soviet revisionist ruling clique bloodily suppressed our students in Europe, Soviet newspapers have published a large number of fabricated and full-of-holes so-called news and reports in recent days, attempting to distort the facts, confuse right and wrong, and evade responsibility. This further exposes the cowardly nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership, who fear the truth and fear the facts.

In the past few days, all the "reports" in Soviet newspapers and journals about the "January 25" incident have not dared to directly deny the fact that Chinese students were beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents while laying a wreath at Lenin's Mausoleum.

News officials openly lie

On the 28th, the *Izvestia* published a speech given by the Deputy Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Pyadyshev, at a press conference. He fabricates and lies, saying: "The Chinese citizens lined up at the mausoleum, crossed the barrier, took out the little red book of Mao Zedong's quotations, and began to shout them in unison. Thus, they created chaos and obstructed other visitors from entering the mausoleum. The Soviet people standing behind this group of Chinese students patiently waited. Usually, two or three police officers who maintain order at the mausoleum suggested that the Chinese citizens either enter the mausoleum or make way and not block the queue. ... The Chinese citizens replaced reading the quotations with continuous hysterical shouting. At this moment, one of them slapped a woman standing in the queue. This seemed to be a signal to all these Chinese citizens. They began to rush towards the Soviet people and beat them. ..."

Enough, there is no need to quote more. As eyewitnesses, we have the right to say that this is a complete distortion and slander. From Pyadyshev's "speech," Chinese students are portrayed as such a group of people: they read Chairman Mao's quotations and then started shouting and beating a woman. This is sheer nonsense, not even a child would believe such a ridiculous fabrication.

The truth is: when Chinese students were orderly and calmly reciting the quotations of our great leader Chairman Mao, a Soviet officer standing in front of the mausoleum said, "Go, go!" while raising his hand to signal the hundreds of thugs pre-positioned behind the Chinese students. The police and plainclothes agents swarmed in, pushing and pulling the Chinese students from the right side and behind. They started beating people and closed the doors of Lenin's Mausoleum. Where was the "suggestion" for Chinese students to enter the mausoleum? Pyadyshev said that the "Soviet people" behind the Chinese students were "patiently waiting," so everything should have been peaceful. How could the Chinese students have caused trouble by "shouting" and "beating people"? What kind of logic is this?

When the Chinese students began to be dragged, pulled, beaten, and pushed by the military police and plainclothes agents, the Chinese students sang the *Internationale* in unison. Soviet newspapers have never dared to reveal the ironclad fact that Chinese students sang the *Internationale* in Red Square. They referred to the sound of the *Internationale* as "continuous hysterical shouting." How shameless! This once again shows that they have long betrayed the cause of the international proletariat and are terrified of the *Internationale*.

"Chargé d'affaires" and "secretary" mix up names

This "report" from the Soviet Foreign Ministry's press conference also mistakenly refers to Comrade Miu Qun of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union as a "first secretary" and then as a "chargé d'affaires," and fabricates absurdly that on the evening of the 25th, the chargé d'affaires Miu Qun went to the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Gentlemen of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, when did the Chinese Embassy notify the Soviet Foreign Ministry that there are two chargés d'affaires? Why in the same report is there one chargé d'affaires An Zhi Yuan (which is factual), and another chargé d'affaires Miu Qun? Mixing up names and not even getting basic facts straight, does the Soviet Foreign Ministry have the qualification to explain the "facts"?

Mr. Pyadyshev also said that on January 25, "all activities of Chinese students in Red Square were led by the first secretary of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China, Miu Qun." Sir, you are gravely mistaken.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is the planner and chief culprit of this bloody incident, attempting to evade responsibility and shift blame is futile. Your crimes are such that even the waters of the Volga River cannot wash away.

The "intelligence" that the Deputy Director of the Press Department, Mr. Pyadyshev, has obtained is so poor! He lies about how Miu Qun "attempted to organize a disturbance in Red Square last summer." Let us tell you, last summer Miu Qun was still in our great capital, Beijing. How could he have gone to Moscow, more than 8,000 kilometers away from Beijing, to "attempt to organize a disturbance in Red Square"?

Face-to-face confrontation and playing tricks

To prove that Chinese people "were not beaten," the Soviet Foreign Ministry also fabricated a specific "example": saying that on January 25, when the Chinese chargé d'affaires accompanied by embassy staff Sun Lin went to the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Sun Lin's face had no bruises, but on the 26th, when Sun Lin went to the station, his face was smeared with iodine.

Sun Lin is a diplomat from the embassy, a third secretary. On the 25th, when he accompanied Chinese students to lay a wreath in Red Square, he was injured in the suppression by Soviet military police, with his right cheek below his eye broken and bleeding. At that time, when he accompanied the chargé d'affaires of our embassy to the Soviet Foreign Ministry to submit a protest note to the Deputy Foreign Minister Fei Lv Bin, he showed Fei Lv Bin his facial injuries on the spot. However, Fei Lv Bin and his assistants did not dare to look. The deputy director of the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry fabricated the lie that Sun Lin deliberately smeared iodine, is this not shameful?

The Soviet Foreign Ministry, in order to turn "unreason" into "reason," arbitrarily claimed that on the 25th, the Chinese chargé d'affaires refused to accept the summons from the Soviet Foreign Ministry's deputy minister for several hours. The truth is: on the afternoon of the 25th, as soon as the bloody incident occurred, the Chinese chargé d'affaires immediately requested a meeting with a representative of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. He even personally waited in the courtyard of the Soviet Foreign Ministry for more than an hour, but the Soviet Foreign Ministry dared not face him. The lies fabricated by the Soviet Foreign Ministry can stop now!

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership regarding the "January 25" bloody incident do not precisely prove that they fear Mao Zedong Thought, fear the truth, fear the people, and fear the revolution? Do they not precisely show that they are genuine paper tigers?

    看，莫斯科造谣专家的丑恶表演
    犯了罪，不认账，纸老虎，显真相
    “一·二五”苏联修正主义统治集团血腥镇压我国留欧学生的事件发生后，连日来苏联报纸刊登大量歪曲事实真相、漏洞百出的所谓消息和报道，妄图颠倒黑白，开脱罪责。从而更加暴露了苏修领导集团害怕真理，害怕事实的虚弱本质。
    几天来，苏联报刊所有有关“一·二五”事件的“报道”都不敢正面否认中国学生在列宁陵墓献花圈时遭到苏联军警和便衣特务的毒打这一事实。
    新闻官员公开撒谎
    二十八日《消息报》刊登了苏联外交部新闻司副司长皮亚迪谢夫就此事举行的一次记者招待会上的讲话。他胡诌八扯地说：“中国公民们在陵墓旁站好了队伍，越过了栏杆，掏出了毛泽东语录的小书，并开始齐声喊他的语录。这样，他们造成了混乱，妨碍其他参观者进入列宁墓。站在这群中国学生后边的苏联人，耐心地等待着。通常在参观陵墓时站在一旁的两三个维持秩序的警察建议中国公民要么进入陵墓，要么让出道来不要挡住队伍。……中国公民们用不断地歇斯底里的叫喊代替了读语录。正在这时他们之中的一个，对着站在队伍中的一个妇女的脸上打去。这似乎是对所有这些中国公民们的一个信号。他们开始冲向苏联人并打他们。……”
    够啦，无须再多引用了。我们作为一个现场目睹者，有充分的权利说，这完全是歪曲和诽谤。从皮亚迪谢夫的“讲话”中看，中国留学生竟是这样一群人：他们读了毛主席语录后就无缘无故地大叫大嚷起来，而且动手打起一个妇女来了。这简直是白日梦呓，连小孩子也不会相信的可笑的捏造。
    事实的真相是：当中国学生整齐而有秩序地朗读我们伟大的领袖毛主席的语录时，站在陵墓前的一个苏联军官一边说：“走吧，走吧！”一边举手向预先布置在中国学生身后的几百个打手示意，警察和便衣特务就蜂涌而上，从中国学生队伍的右侧和背后推拉中国学生。他们动手打人而且把列宁陵墓的大门关上了，那里还有什么“建议”中国学生进入列宁墓的事呢？！皮亚迪谢夫说，站在中国学生身后的“苏联人”“耐心地等待着”，那么，一切应当是平静的，中国学生又怎么会无事生非地去“大叫大嚷”“动手打人”呢？世上那有这种逻辑呢？
    当中国学生开始被军警和便衣特务们拖、拉、打、推的时候，中国学生们齐声高唱《国际歌》。苏联报纸一直不敢透露中国学生在红场高唱《国际歌》这一铁的事实，他们把《国际歌》的声音称作是“不断地歇斯底里的叫喊”。这是多么无耻啊！这再一次说明了他们早已背叛了国际无产阶级事业，连《国际歌》都怕得要死。
  “代办”“秘书”张冠李戴
    苏联外交部记者招待会的这篇“报道”，还竟然把中国驻苏联大使馆的缪群同志一忽儿称作是“一等秘书”，一忽儿又称作是“临时代办”，而且捏造得太离奇了，说什么二十五日晚临时代办缪群曾去苏联外交部。苏联外交部的先生们，中国使馆什么时候通知过苏联外交部，有两个临时代办呢？为什么在同一篇报道中有一个临时代办安致远（这是合乎事实的），还有第二个临时代办缪群呢？张冠李戴，根本连一些基本事实都弄不清楚，苏联外交部那里还有资格来说明“事实真相”呢！
    皮亚迪谢夫先生还说什么，一月二十五日红场上“中国学生的一切活动都是由中华人民共和国使馆一等秘书缪群领导的”。先生，你大错而特错了。
    苏修领导集团是这次流血事件的策划者和罪魁祸首，企图抵赖和嫁祸于人是办不到的，你们的罪责就是倾伏尔加河之水也洗不掉的。
    身为新闻司副司长的皮亚迪谢夫先生搞到的“情报”是何等糟啊！他胡说什么，缪群“还在去年夏天就企图在红场组织骚动”。让我们告诉你吧，去年夏天缪群还在我们伟大祖国的首都——北京，他怎么可能到远离北京八千多公里的莫斯科“企图在红场组织骚动”呢？
      当面对证又耍无赖
    为了证明中国人“没挨打”，苏联外交部还捏造了这样一件具体“例子”：说什么一月二十五日当中国临时代办在使馆工作人员孙林陪同下到苏联外交部时，当时孙林的脸上没有任何青肿，而二十六日孙林到车站时脸上却擦上了碘酒。
    孙林是使馆的外交官，三等秘书。二十五日陪同中国学生去红场献花圈时，他在苏联军警镇压中，右眼下的面颊被打破流血。当时他在陪同我驻苏使馆临时代办向苏联外交部副部长费留宾提出抗议照会时，当面让费留宾看他脸上的伤痕。而费留宾及其助手们当时却不敢看。苏联外交部新闻司这个副司长编造孙林是故意涂抹碘酒的谎言，难道不感到羞耻吗？
    苏联外交部为了把“无理”硬要说为“有理”，不顾事实地硬说二十五日中国临时代办几小时内拒绝接受苏联外交部副部长的召见。而事实真相是：二十五日中午流血事件刚一发生，中国临时代办立即就向苏联外交部远东司提出会见外交部代表的要求。甚至他亲自到苏联外交部的前庭整整等候了一个多小时，而苏联外交部不敢照面。苏联外交部编造的谎言可以休矣！
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”苏修领导集团对于“一·二五”流血事件的所作所为不正是证明了他们害怕毛泽东思想、害怕真理、害怕人民、害怕革命的反动本质么！不正是说明他们是地地道道的纸老虎吗？
