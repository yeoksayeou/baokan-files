Afro-Asian friends have recently sent letters and made statements, enthusiastically praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards.

A Malian technician named Sissoko wrote in a letter to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "I greatly respect Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and also in the hearts of the people of the world. The Chinese people have followed his teachings and thus launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

In his letter, Sissoko wrote: "I wish Chairman Mao good health and longevity! I wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution great success in dealing a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and modern revisionism!"

A Malian friend said: "The Cultural Revolution is a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. That is why imperialism and modern revisionism are trying so hard to slander this revolution. But we will not be deceived. We understand this revolution, and we believe this revolution will surely be victorious."

A Malian friend named Sakho recently wrote a letter to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, saying: "The entire progressive humanity, especially we Africans, are following with great interest the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong, the contemporary Lenin. I am fully convinced that People's China will become even stronger, and capitalism will never be restored in China."

Mrs. Nancy Grant, a member of the Executive Committee of the Sierra Leone People's National Party and the Secretary-General of the National Women's Congress, recently said in a statement, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows that China is a beacon for Asia and Africa. The Chinese Red Guards are excellent."

Haydar Fayyad, the editor-in-chief of the Iraqi newspaper *Al-Fajr Al-Jadid*, who had visited China, recently wrote a letter to Xinhua News Agency. The letter said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is being carried out under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. I personally felt the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for the Cultural Revolution. He continued, "During my stay in China, I saw with my own eyes that the Red Guards are disciplined, orderly, and follow commands."

Nigerian writer Sulay said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will have a profound impact on the world. No country in the world has ever carried out such a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great innovation. The reason why the Cultural Revolution can be carried out in China today is that it has a strong party and an awakened people."

Two Algerian university students who had recently visited China jointly wrote a letter praising the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. They wrote in the letter: "We have met some Red Guards and are very pleased to see their loyalty to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, their unconditional loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."

    亚非朋友热烈赞扬我国文化大革命是伟大的创举
    中国必将更加强大永不变色
    据新华社讯　亚非朋友最近纷纷来信和发表谈话，热情赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵小将。
    一位名叫西瑟的马里技术员在给新华社记者的一封信中说：“我非常尊敬毛主席，毛主席是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是世界各国人民心中的红太阳，中国人民遵循了他的教导，所以就开展了无产阶级文化大革命。”
    西瑟在信中写道：“祝毛主席身体健康，万寿无疆！祝无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进，给予美帝国主义及其走狗和现代修正主义以致命的打击！”
    一位马里朋友说：中国的文化大革命“对帝国主义和现代修正主义来说是一次沉重的打击。正因为这样，帝国主义和现代修正主义就竭力诬蔑这一革命。但是我们是不会受骗的，我们了解这一革命，我们相信这场革命必将胜利。”
    一位名叫萨科的马里朋友最近写信给新华社记者说：整个进步人类，特别是我们非洲人，都怀着极大的兴趣，关注着在毛泽东——当代的列宁——思想指导下的中国人民所进行的无产阶级文化大革命。我完全相信，人民中国必将更加强大，资本主义永远不会在中国复辟。
    塞拉勒窝内全国人民大会党执行委员会委员、妇女全国大会组织书记南西·格兰特夫人最近发表谈话说，“中国无产阶级文化大革命表明中国是亚非的灯塔。中国红卫兵好得很。”
    曾经访问过中国的伊拉克《新黎明报》总编辑海达尔·法雅兹最近写信给新华社。信中说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是在毛泽东思想指导下进行的，我亲身感受到了中国人民对文化大革命的热情。他接着说：“我在中国期间亲眼看到，红卫兵是有秩序，有纪律和听从命令的。”
    尼日尔作家苏利说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命将对世界发生深远的影响。世界上还没有一个国家进行过这样一场无产阶级文化大革命，这是一个伟大的创举。目前在中国之所以能够进行文化大革命是由于它有一个坚强的党和有觉悟的人民。
    不久以前到过中国的两名阿尔及利亚大学生联名写信，赞扬红卫兵的革命行动。他们在信中说：“我们会见过一些红卫兵，我们以极其高兴的心情看到他们对中国革命和世界革命的忠诚，看到他们无限忠于马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。”
