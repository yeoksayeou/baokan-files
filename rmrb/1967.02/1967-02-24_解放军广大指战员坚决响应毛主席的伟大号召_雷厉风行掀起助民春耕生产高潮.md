PLA soldiers and officers resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, swiftly launching a wave of support for spring farming and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 23rd, our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" has become a tremendous driving force inspiring and propelling the broad masses of PLA soldiers and officers to launch a wave of support for spring farming and production. From the moment the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Rural People's Communes, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cadres at All Levels" was broadcast, the soldiers and officers of the army, navy, and air force have been simultaneously engaged in enthusiastic study and propaganda activities, and have immediately taken action, forming teams to support spring farming and production, rushing to the front lines of spring farming and production, and together with the main force in the countryside—broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants—jointly launching a spring farming and production campaign.

PLA units have been following Chairman Mao's instructions that the PLA is not only a fighting force but also a working force and a productive force. As early as last winter, many units and leading organs of the entire army took measures to support rural preparations for farming. This year, as soon as spring arrived, to make the spring farming and production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better, and to achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production, the units further strengthened their support and assistance for spring farming. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Rural People's Communes, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cadres at All Levels," the PLA's support for spring farming activities reached a new high. In the earliest season of Hainan Island, the leading organs of the garrison studied measures to support spring farming at the end of last year. Soldiers and officers, carrying Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," went to the foot of the Five-Finger Mountain and along the coast of the Beibu Gulf as early as one or two months ago, extensively propagating and actively supporting agricultural production, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, vigorously promoting revolution and production. Soldiers and officers of the garrisons in Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and other regions, after supporting the revolutionary factions in seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, advanced victoriously, dispatching many cadres and soldiers to the countryside to support spring farming. They expressed their determination to seize the season with a spirit of "every moment counts," supporting the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasant community members in carrying out spring farming and production, and laying a solid foundation for this year's agricultural harvest.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force in the countryside for grasping revolution and promoting production. When the soldiers and officers supporting spring farming production arrived in the countryside, they particularly emphasized arming this main force with Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together, and jointly using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the production struggle. In many regions, spring farming is being carried out with great enthusiasm. Soldiers and officers of a certain regiment who participated in supporting the revolutionary factions in Qingdao in seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, on the day the Party Central Committee's letter was published, sang heroic and magnificent battle songs, braved the wind and rain, and rushed to Changshan County's Zhonghan, Shazi Kou, and Li Village communes to support the construction of reservoirs and land leveling. The soldiers' and officers' sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm was warmly praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In supporting spring farming and production, many units actively helped production teams solve practical difficulties. Comrades from the logistics department of a certain unit in Guangzhou saw that the local production team had tens of thousands of pounds of sugarcane piled in the fields, making transportation difficult, so they immediately dispatched horse-drawn carts to help with transportation. Some companies in this unit also brought woodworking tools to the fields to repair farming tools for the community members. The second company of a certain artillery unit, while helping the production team with spring farming and spring sowing, learned that the production team lacked fertilizer for planting peanuts, so they proactively delivered the unit's fertilizer to the production team's peanut fields at night, assisting the production team in completing the peanut planting task ahead of schedule. They then assisted the production team in implementing and completing spring farming tasks one by one. The poor and lower-middle peasant community members gratefully said, "The PLA is truly the people's army. With the PLA's support, we must better grasp revolution and promote production, and lay a solid foundation for this year's agricultural harvest."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Soldiers and officers on the front lines of spring farming and production, while working, particularly pay attention to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together with rural cadres, helping them consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants on major spring farming matters, and launching a spring farming and production campaign. Soldiers and officers of the ninth company of a certain unit in Beijing saw that some cadres in the local countryside had made some mistakes, lacked enthusiasm for leading production, and were not good at consulting with the masses, leading to poor production. They worked together with these cadres while laboring, helped them study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and educated and assisted these cadres in eliminating private thoughts, putting down their burdens, and moving forward lightly, resolutely becoming cadres who implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, doing a good job in spring farming and production, and making amends for past mistakes.

### 解放军广大指战员坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召  雷厉风行掀起助民春耕生产高潮

    解放军广大指战员坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召
    雷厉风行掀起助民春耕生产高潮
    据新华社二十三日讯　我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，已经成为鼓舞和推动人民解放军广大指战员掀起助民春耕生产高潮的巨大动力。从《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》广播之时起，陆海空三军指战员一面热烈地学习和开展宣传活动，一面立即行动起来，组成一支支支援春耕生产的队伍，奔赴春耕生产第一线，和农村中抓革命，促生产的主力军——广大贫下中农一起，共同掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    人民解放军各部队遵循毛主席关于人民解放军既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队的教导，早在去年冬天，全军许多部队和领导机关就采取了支援农村备耕的措施。今年一开春，为了把无产阶级文化大革命中的春耕生产搞得好上加好，夺取文化大革命和生产的双胜利，各部队更进一步加强了支持和帮助春耕的工作。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表后，解放军助民春耕活动掀起了新的高潮。在季节最早的海南岛，驻军领导机关去年年底就研究了支援春耕的措施。指战员们早在一两个月前，就带着毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，到五指山下，到北部湾沿海，广泛宣传，积极支援农业生产，和广大贫下中农一起大抓革命，狠促生产。驻上海、山西、黑龙江、贵州等地区部队的广大指战员，在支持无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，乘胜前进，派出许多干部战士下乡支援春耕。他们表示要以“只争朝夕”的精神抓住季节，支援广大贫下中农社员搞好春耕生产，为取得今年农业丰收打下坚实基础。
    广大贫下中农是农村中抓革命，促生产的主力军。支援春耕生产的指战员们一到农村，特别重视用毛泽东思想武装这支主力军，和他们一起活学活用毛主席著作，共同用毛泽东思想指导生产斗争，许多地区的春耕搞得热火朝天。曾参加支持青岛市无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的某团指战员，在党中央的信发表的当天，唱着雄壮豪迈的战歌，冒着风雨，奔赴崂山县中韩、沙子口、李村等公社，支援修水库、平整土地。指战员们冲天的革命干劲，受到贫下中农的热烈赞扬。
    在支援春耕生产中，许多部队还积极帮助生产队解决实际困难。广州部队某部机关管理科的同志看到驻地生产队有几万斤甘蔗堆在地里，运输有困难，就立即派出马车帮助运输。这个部队有的连队还把木工用具带到田头，给社员修理农具。某部迫击炮二连在帮助生产队春耕春播时，得知生产队种花生还缺少肥料，就主动把连队的肥料连夜送到生产队的花生地里，协助生产队提前完成了花生抢种任务。接着又协助生产队一项一项地落实、完成春耕任务。贫下中农社员感激地说，解放军真是人民的子弟兵，有解放军的支援，我们一定要更好地抓革命，促生产，为今年农业丰收打下扎实的基础。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”在春耕生产第一线的指战员们，在劳动中还特别注意和农村干部一起活学活用毛主席著作，帮助他们同贫下中农共同商量春耕大事，掀起春耕生产高潮。北京部队某部九连的干部战士看到驻地农村有些干部因为犯了些错误，领导生产劲头不足，有的是不善于同群众商量，群众有意见，生产搞得不够好。就一边和这些干部共同劳动，一边帮助他们活学活用“老三篇”，并且教育、帮助这些干部破除私心杂念，放下包袱，轻装前进，坚决做一个执行毛主席革命路线的干部，搞好春耕生产，将功补过。
