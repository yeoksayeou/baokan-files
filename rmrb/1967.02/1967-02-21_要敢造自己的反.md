Title: Dare to Rebel Against Oneself

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the souls of people. This revolution has drawn in everyone.

Every revolutionary must undergo the test of this struggle.

Revolution is not just about overthrowing those who take the capitalist road; it is also about overthrowing oneself!

Rebellion is not just about rebelling against those who take the capitalist road; it is also about rebelling against oneself!

We must use the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to bombard the bourgeois headquarters in our minds and overthrow the "self" hidden deep in our souls!

Overthrowing oneself is not easy; it is a painful process.

Some people have done good deeds in the past and have made contributions to the revolution. As a result, they become arrogant, believing they are the best. When someone gives them advice, they think it is "touching the tiger's whiskers" and reject it outright.

Some comrades who have made mistakes in the past shout loudly about washing their faces and changing their hearts, making vows and resolutions many times, but their butts remain stuck, afraid to touch the dirt in their souls, afraid to reveal what is unpresentable.

Some people appear very revolutionary, but when it comes to themselves, they become weak and powerless.

Having revolutionary slogans without the resolve to rebel against oneself is not enough. To remove thorns, one must not fear pain; to cure illness, one must not fear bitter medicine! The bourgeois headquarters in our minds must be heavily bombarded and fiercely burned. Only in this way can we burn away the individualism in our minds and smash the old world in our souls, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy our souls completely!

Thoughts leap forward in struggle, and true gold is tempered in fire.

Public and private interests are incompatible. Where there is public interest, there is no private interest; where there is private interest, public interest is forgotten! Those who are selfish and dare not rebel, those who are selfless and thoroughly revolutionary! To be revolutionary, one must break away from selfishness and establish public interest.

Breaking away from selfishness and establishing public interest—how? Through the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

In the midst of struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, constantly comparing ourselves with them. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it. In this way, the ugly bourgeois individualism will have no place to hide, and a red sun of Mao Zedong Thought will rise in our minds!

    要敢造自己的反
    红缨枪
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。这个革命把所有的人都卷进来了。
    每一个革命者，都要经受这场斗争的考验。
    革命，不但要革走资本主义道路当权派的命，还要革自己的命！
    造反，不但要造走资本主义道路当权派的反，还要造自己的反！
    我们要用毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，炮打自己头脑中的资产阶级司令部，打倒潜藏在灵魂深处的“私”字！
    革自己的命，很不容易，是一件痛苦的事。
    有的人过去做了一些好事，为革命立了一些功劳，于是乎手舞足蹈，渐渐地滋长起“老子天下第一”的骄气。有人给他提意见，他便认为是“太岁头上动土”，一概拒之门外。
    有些犯过错误的同志，口头上大喊要洗面革心，誓言发了好几次，决心下了好几回，但屁股还是赖着不动，他们就是怕触及自己灵魂里的脏东西，就是怕亮出来见不得人。
    有的人看起来很革命，但革到自己头上时，就变得有气无力了。
    光有革命的壮语，而没有造自己反的决心，那是不行的。要挑出刺，就得不怕痛；要医好病，就得不怕吃苦药！对头脑中的资产阶级司令部，一定要用重炮猛轰之，大火猛烧之。只有这样，才能把头脑中的个人主义烧个一干二净，把灵魂中的旧世界打个落花流水，让毛泽东思想百分之百占领我们的灵魂！
    思想在斗争中飞跃，真金在烈火中炼成。
    公与私，水火不相容。有公则无私，有私则忘公！一心为私，不敢造反，一心为公，彻底革命！要革命，就要破私立公。
    破私立公，靠什么？靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，时时用毛主席著作对照自己，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。这样，丑恶的资产阶级个人主义就没有容身之地，一轮红彤彤的毛泽东思想的红太阳就会在我们思想阵地上升起！
