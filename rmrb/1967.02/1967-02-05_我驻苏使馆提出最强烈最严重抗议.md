The Soviet revisionists instigated thugs to break into our embassy, smash and loot the news exhibition windows, and assault our diplomatic personnel. The Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union lodges the strongest and most severe protest.

The statement from the embassy points out that this is a brazen and planned atrocity committed by the Soviet government on the territory of the Chinese Embassy. This is a rare act of fascist barbarism in the history of international relations.

	New China News Agency, Moscow, February 4 — On the morning of February 4, the press officer of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Miu Qun, read out a statement from the Chinese Embassy at a press conference, strongly protesting the new fascist atrocity committed by the Soviet revisionists in instigating plainclothes agents and thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy's front courtyard fence, smash and loot the news exhibition windows, and assault Chinese Embassy diplomatic staff, workers, and journalists.

	The statement, after detailing the process of this savage atrocity planned and carried out by the Soviet revisionists, pointed out that this is a shocking bloodshed incident brazenly and systematically created by the Soviet government on the territory of the Chinese Embassy. This is an unprecedented act of fascist barbarism in the history of international relations. The Chinese Embassy expresses the greatest indignation and lodges the strongest and most severe protest against this.

	The statement said: The Soviet government's pretext of what "anti-Soviet content" and "not in accordance with the recognized norms of diplomatic activities" to cover up its crimes has been completely refuted by our embassy's protest note on February 3. Afterwards, you tried to evade responsibility for your fascist atrocities on the territory of the Chinese Embassy, claiming that it was done by the Soviet working people. This is sheer shamelessness. Your Far East Department Director Sudalikov clearly stated on the morning of February 3 that the Soviet government would take measures to "eliminate" the embassy's windows. This proves that you have done something shameful, and you are very much in the wrong and very weak!

	The statement said: Why is the Soviet revisionist ruling clique so heartless and reckless, daring to commit such despicable acts? The truth is that you are terrified by a few photographs that truthfully reflect the Red Square bloodshed, you are afraid of the truth, you are afraid of the people, you are afraid of the Soviet people knowing the facts, and you are afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	The statement finally emphasized: The brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable by anyone. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's frenzied opposition to Mao Zedong Thought, frenzied anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people stance will definitely not end well!

	New China News Agency, Moscow, February 3 — After the Soviet revisionist leadership clique instigated agents to illegally cut and steal the news photo exhibition windows in the front courtyard of our embassy and brutally assault our diplomatic personnel on the evening of February 3, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, immediately rushed to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding to meet with any Soviet representative. An Zhi Yuan, the acting charge d'affaires, waited for more than an hour at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs still unreasonably refused to receive him.

	Subsequently, our embassy staff continued to contact the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone, and the Soviet side was forced to have the Deputy Director of the Far East Department, Ilyazavkin, meet with our acting charge d'affaires at 23:30. An Zhi Yuan, the acting charge d'affaires, lodged the strongest and most severe protest against the new bloodshed incident created by the Soviet revisionist clique to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

	An Zhi Yuan, the acting charge d'affaires, listed the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist plainclothes agents, thugs, and the "guards" of the embassy after pointing out that this is a shocking crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique in violation of international diplomatic customs. This is a fascist atrocity committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and this is another blood debt owed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique to the Chinese people.

	The protest warned the Soviet revisionist leadership clique: The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. The blood debt you owe will definitely be repaid, and you will not end well.

	An Zhi Yuan, the acting charge d'affaires, made four solemn demands to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs: (1) Severely punish the culprits; (2) Compensate for the losses; (3) Restore the news photo exhibition windows; (4) The Chinese Embassy reserves the right to make further demands.

	Ilyazavkin attempted to deny the facts. An Zhi Yuan, the acting charge d'affaires, immediately gave a stern rebuttal and demanded that he go to the Chinese Embassy to see the crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist clique. This deputy director, afraid of being caught red-handed, dared not go, and was questioned to the point of not daring to raise his head.

    苏修指使暴徒闯入我使馆砸坏和抢劫新闻展览橱窗殴打我外交人员
    我驻苏使馆提出最强烈最严重抗议
    我使馆声明指出，这是苏联政府明目张胆地、有计划地在中国大使馆制造的一个骇人听闻的流血事件。这是国际关系史上罕见的法西斯暴行。
    新华社莫斯科四日电　中华人民共和国驻苏联大使馆新闻专员缪群四日上午在记者招待会上宣读了中国大使馆的一项声明，强烈抗议苏修当局指使便衣特务和暴徒闯入中国大使馆前院围栏内，砸坏和抢劫新闻展览橱窗，殴打中国大使馆外交官员、工作人员和中国记者的新的法西斯暴行。
    声明在详细揭露了苏修当局蓄谋制造的这一野蛮暴行的经过后指出，这是苏联政府明目张胆地、有计划地在中国大使馆领土上制造的一个骇人听闻的流血事件。这是国际关系史上罕见的法西斯野蛮行为。中国大使馆对此表示最大的愤慨，并提出最强烈、最严重的抗议。
    声明说：苏联政府为掩盖罪责而事先制造的什么“反苏内容”“同外交代表机构活动的公认准则不符”之类的借口，已被我使馆二月三日的抗议照会统统驳倒了。事后，你们又想逃脱你们在中国大使馆领土上采取的法西斯暴行的责任，胡说什么这是苏联劳动人民干的。这简直是耍无赖。你们外交部远东司司长苏达利柯夫三日上午明明说是苏联政府要采取措施“消灭”大使馆的橱窗。这证明你们干了见不得人的勾当，你们理亏得很，虚弱得很！
    声明说：苏修统治集团为什么如此丧心病狂，冒天下之大不韪，干出这种下流的勾当呢？说穿了就是因为你们被如实反映红场流血事件的几张照片吓破了胆，就是因为你们害怕真理，害怕人民、害怕苏联人民了解事实真相，就是因为你们害怕伟大的毛泽东思想。
    声明最后强调说：伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉是任何人都阻挡不住的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”苏修统治集团疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，疯狂地反华、反共、反人民，是一定不会有好下场的！
    新华社莫斯科三日电　苏联修正主义领导集团三日晚上指使特务在我大使馆前院围栏内非法砍锯和劫走我新闻图片展览橱窗，残暴殴打我外交人员的罪行发生后，我驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远当即赶赴苏联外交部，要求会见任何一个苏方代表。安致远临时代办在苏联外交部等候一个多小时，苏联外交部仍无理拒绝接见。
    随后我使馆人员又不间断地用电话向苏联外交部联系，苏方才不得不在二十三时三十分由远东司副司长伊利扎维金出面会见我临时代办。安致远临时代办对苏修集团制造的新的流血事件向苏联外交部提出了最强烈、最严重的抗议。
    安致远临时代办在抗议中列举了苏修便衣特务和暴徒以及“守卫”大使馆的警察的法西斯暴行后指出，这是苏联修正主义领导集团破坏国际外交惯例的骇人听闻的罪行，这是苏联修正主义领导集团的法西斯暴行，这是苏联修正主义领导集团欠下中国人民的又一笔血债。
    抗议警告苏修领导集团：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的，你们欠下的血债是一定要偿还的，你们是不会有好下场的。
    安致远临时代办向苏联外交部提出了四点严正要求：（一）严惩凶手；（二）赔偿损失；（三）恢复新闻图片橱窗；（四）中国大使馆保留进一步提出要求的权利。
    伊利扎维金妄图在事实面前矢口抵赖。安致远临时代办当即给予严厉驳斥，并要求他去中国大使馆观看苏修集团犯下的罪行。这个副司长作贼心虚不敢前往，被质问得连头也不敢抬起来。
