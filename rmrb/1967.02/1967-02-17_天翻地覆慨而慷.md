The workers of the revolutionary rebel faction of the Chongqing Prospecting Machinery Factory of the Geological Bureau have kicked out the clique of capital roaders within the factory, seized their power, and overthrown their rule. The political landscape of the entire factory has undergone a dramatic change, and the production landscape has also undergone a dramatic change. This vivid fact demonstrates the immense power of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and confirms the wise judgment in the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful impetus for the development of productive forces in our country."

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Once the proletarian revolutionary faction takes charge and seizes power, it will inevitably be able to thoroughly cleanse the capitalist and revisionist mud and filth within the enterprise, smash all the outdated rules and regulations that hinder the development of production, and achieve a great leap in socialist production. From the changes in Chongqing Prospecting Machinery Factory over the past month, we can also see this brilliant and beautiful prospect.

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." The proletarian revolutionary rebels who bravely charge forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have the reddest hearts and the hardest bones. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our compass, we can reach the moon in the sky and catch turtles in the deep seas. Since we dare to rise up in revolution and dare to seize power, we will certainly be able to grasp the destiny of economic construction, boost production, and build all factories and mines into red enterprises of Mao Zedong Thought.

    天翻地覆慨而慷
    地质部重庆探矿机械厂革命造反派工人，踢开厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，专了他们的政，夺了他们的权。全厂政治面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化，生产面貌随着也发生了翻天覆地的变化。这个生动的事实，显示了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的巨大威力，证实了毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条中的英明论断：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级革命派当了家，掌了权，就必然能彻底荡涤企业中的资本主义、修正主义的污泥浊水，砸烂束缚生产发展的各种陈腐的条条框框，使社会主义的生产来一个大飞跃。从重庆探矿机械厂一个月的变化，我们也可以看到这一光辉灿烂的美好前景。
    伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”在无产阶级文化大革命中勇猛冲锋陷阵的无产阶级革命造反派，心最红，骨最硬。我们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指针，就可上九天揽月，下五洋捉鳖。我们既然敢起来革命，敢起来夺权，那么，我们也一定能掌握经济建设的命运，把生产搞上去，把所有的工厂矿山建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新企业。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们耍尽了花招，千方百计破坏文化大革命，破坏生产。当他们被革命造反派踢下“宝座”的时候，又躲在阴暗角落里，吹冷风，放毒箭，妄想使生产垮下来。资产阶级老爷们，你们听着：你们过去的阴谋诡计都破产了，今天，你们再敢耍什么鬼把戏，就只能碰个头破血流！
