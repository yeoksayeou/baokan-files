Our great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "practice economy and promote revolution" reached the Jiangxi Chemical Fiber Factory, and the revolutionary rebels who had emerged from the "gunfire and shelling" were all jubilant and inspired. They said, "At a time when a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are pushing economicism to corrupt the revolutionary masses, our great leader Chairman Mao has timely issued this great call, pointing out the direction for us to advance and giving us boundless strength."

From the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary rebels of the Chemical Fiber Factory have closely followed the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the tricks and conspiracies of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, repelled the attacks of sugar-coated bullets, resisted the infiltration of decadent thoughts, maintained the frugal and simple proletarian character, and upheld the firmness of the proletarian revolution. They have shown with their actions that they are indeed a group of proletarian revolutionaries who can stand the test.

	Small matters are not small

The Chemical Fiber Factory is a modern factory in Jiangxi Province, producing a large quantity of cloth daily. Every inch of cloth in the hands of the revolutionary rebels is so precious! But those bourgeois lords do not value the state's property at all. Out of their bourgeois nature, they flaunt their wealth and waste resources; to maintain the "prestige" of their royalist organizations, they allocate rolls of cloth to make quilts, flags, and armbands for the royalist organizations. Just for the quilts, they made over 150, using over 4,000 feet of cloth and over 1,000 pounds of cotton. They thought that with these eye-catching and generous outfits, they could elevate their own status and that of the royalist organizations.

But the revolutionary rebels always remember Chairman Mao's great call to "practice economy and promote revolution," and they pay attention to frugality everywhere. Although they have easy access to cloth, they do not use even an inch of the state's property lightly. When they go out to meetings or parades and need to make a red flag, no one is willing to use new cloth. They find a piece of worn-out red satin, patch it together, make a red flag, write big characters on it with ink, and march forward proudly. The royalists saw this and laughed, saying, "You are so poor that you can't even make a flag!" The revolutionary rebels retorted, "Revolution does not depend on signs; what does it matter if the flag is small! Our direction is correct, and our stance is firm. Our flag is a truly red banner." They carried this flag to participate in meetings and rebellions everywhere. Later, as time passed, many places on the flag were torn, but the revolutionary rebels still did not want to replace it. They said, "This is the banner of revolution, the banner of practicing economy and promoting revolution. We carried this banner and united the majority of the workers in the factory; we will continue to carry this banner and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!"

	Maintaining the frugal character

The revolutionary rebels united, and their ranks grew larger. Several liaison personnel ran east and west, wearing out their shoes. Someone said: If we bought a few bicycles, that would be convenient! At this time, the economic power of the entire factory was in the hands of the revolutionary rebels. All they needed was a stamp, and they could immediately push back a few bicycles. "There may be such communists who have not been defeated by enemies with guns; they are indeed heroes in front of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." Chairman Mao's wise directive thundered in the ears of the revolutionary rebels. They said: Those in power who were hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie have become corrupt in their lives and revisionist in their politics. This is a historical lesson. If the revolutionary rebels follow their example, then they are "'王' written upside down—exactly the same." The revolutionary rebels followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "everything should be done according to the principle of frugality," resolutely not adding bicycles, and resolutely not using their power to add new things at will. Several enthusiastic workers lent their bicycles to the liaison personnel to use, even though they had to commute to work early and late.

The issue of buying a camera was the same. At that time, many revolutionary rebels were beaten and struggled against, and they needed a camera to record the situation. But everyone did not agree to buy one. They said: If one factory buys a camera, then tens of thousands of factories nationwide, how many would they buy! They never bought one. Learning from the proletariat

When the factory needed something, the revolutionary rebels always fully discussed it with the masses. Through discussion, they raised everyone's ideological awareness and made Chairman Mao's great call to "practice economy and promote revolution" deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Buying a tape recorder is a vivid story.

The factory's broadcasting room originally planned to purchase two tape recorders, and the money had been approved. When they were about to leave for Shanghai to buy them, they re-learned Chairman Mao's teaching: "Economy is something that all work units should pay attention to, and economic and financial work units should pay special attention to it." How should they pay attention? Everyone discussed and decided to ask the students who were preparing to return to Shanghai to buy on their behalf, saving the travel expenses. Even so, someone still had different opinions. They said, buying one and making do with it, isn't that saving half the money? Everyone argued more vigorously, and unanimously took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recited together: "Every place must cherish manpower and material resources, and must not only consider the moment and waste recklessly." The Shanghai student who was linking up in the factory finished reading the quotations and was deeply moved by the spirit of the revolutionary rebels, saying: "Comrade workers, we Red Guards should learn from you. Learn from you to consult Chairman Mao's works when encountering problems. I suggest: you don't buy two tape recorders, not even one. I will borrow one from the school for you to use on behalf of you."

This is not just a tape recorder; this is a great promotion of the spirit of practicing economy and promoting revolution; this is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 节约闹革命是我们工人阶级的本色

    节约闹革命是我们工人阶级的本色
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的指示传到江西化学纤维厂之后，从“枪林弹雨”中杀将出来的革命造反派无不欢欣鼓舞。他们说：“正当党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大搞经济主义，以此来腐蚀革命群众的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席及时发出这一伟大号召，给我们指出了前进的方向，给我们增添了无限力量。”
    化学纤维厂的革命造反派，从文化大革命一开始，就紧靠光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想，识破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子所玩弄的阴谋诡计，击退了糖衣炮弹的进攻，冲决了腐朽思想的侵蚀，坚持了艰苦朴素的无产阶级本色，保持了无产阶级革命的坚定性。他们以实际行动表明，他们不愧是一批经得起考验的无产阶级革命战士。
      “小事”不小
    化学纤维厂是江西省一座现代化工厂，每天出产大量布匹。国家的每一寸布，在革命造反派手里是多么珍贵啊！可是那些资产阶级老爷们却毫不把国家的财产看在眼里。他们出于资产阶级的本性，讲排场，讲阔气，挥霍浪费；他们为了长保皇组织的“声势”，把成匹布拨给保皇组织做被子，做旗子，做袖章。只是被子一项就做了一百五十多床，花费棉布四千多尺，棉花一千多斤。他们自以为靠这些显眼、优厚的装备，就能抬高自己和保皇组织的身价。
    可是，革命造反派时刻记住毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，处处注意勤俭，尽管“近水楼台”，用布方便，却不肯轻易动用国家一寸布。他们出外开会、游行，需要制一面红旗，可没有人肯用新布。他们找来一块用破了的红绸子，拼拼整整，做成红旗，用墨笔写上大字，撑起来雄赳赳地前进。保皇派见了大笑说：“你们穷得连旗子也做不起！”革命造反派针锋相对地说：“干革命不靠招牌，旗子小点有什么关系！我们方向正，立场稳，我们的旗子是真正红色的旗帜。”他们打着这面红旗，到处参加集会、造反。后来时间长了，旗子上许多地方破了，但是革命造反派的同志们还是舍不得换一面。他们说：“这是革命的大旗，是节约闹革命的大旗。”“我们打着这面大旗，已经把全厂大多数职工团结起来了；我们还要打着这面大旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
      保持勤俭本色
    革命造反派大联合，队伍越来越大。几个联络人员，东奔西跑，鞋底磨穿了。有人说：如果买几部自行车那该多方便啊！这时，全厂的经济大权已夺在革命造反派手里，只要一个大印盖下去，马上就可推回几部自行车。“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”毛主席这一英明指示象春雷般响在革命造反派耳边，他们说：被资产阶级糖衣炮弹打中的那些当权人物，他们在生活上腐化堕落，在政治上搞修正主义。这是历史的教训。革命造反派如果跟他们一样，那就是“‘王’字倒写——一个样。”革命造反派遵照毛主席教导的“什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则”，坚决不添置自行车，坚决不凭手中的权随便添置新东西。几位热心革命的工人，宁愿自己上下班起早摸黑赶路，而把自己的自行车借给联络人员使用。
    买照相机的问题也是这样。当时，很多革命造反派的同志挨打、受斗，他们很需要有个照相机把实况拍下来。可是大家都不赞成买。他们说：要是一个工厂买一架照相机，全国成千上万个工厂，该买多少！他们始终没有买。向工人阶级学习
    厂内需要什么东西，革命造反派总是充分让群众讨论。通过讨论，使大家提高思想认识，使毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召深入人心。
    买录音机就是一个生动的故事。
    这个厂的广播室原来就计划购两部录音机，钱也批下来了。当他们就要动身去上海购买的时候，重学了毛主席的教导：“节约是一切工作机关都要注意的，经济和财政工作机关尤其要注意。”自己怎么注意呢？大家一讨论，决定请准备回上海的在厂串连学生代买，省下路费。就是这样，还有人提出不同意见。他们说，买一台，凑合着用，不是又可以省一半的钱吗？大家越辩越来劲，不约而同地拿出《毛主席语录》齐声朗读：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”那位在厂串连的上海学生念完语录，为革命造反派这种精神深为感动，说：“工人同志们，我们红卫兵要向你们学习。学习你们遇见问题就请教毛主席著作。我建议：你们两部录音机一部也别买。我代你们从学校借一部供你们使用。”
    这不仅仅是一部录音机，这是节约闹革命精神的大发扬，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
