The Soviet revisionist authorities on February 9th arbitrarily announced the stripping of our country's journalists in Moscow of their legitimate right to take photographs in the Soviet Union. This is another new crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique in their deliberate attempt to further deteriorate the relations between the two countries. In response, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Department, our Embassy in the Soviet Union, and our journalists in Moscow have all lodged the strongest protests to the relevant Soviet authorities.

On February 9th, Soviet Foreign Ministry Counselor Vladimir and Bekov summoned the *People's Daily* correspondent Xie Wenqing in the middle of the day. Vladimir first, on behalf of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department, issued a "warning," launching a tirade against the *People's Daily*'s February 6th article that truthfully reported how the Soviet revisionist leadership clique on February 3rd instigated thugs to storm the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, smashing and looting the embassy's news exhibition window, and beating up Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff. The article, titled "This New Blood Debt Must Be Settled!", was labeled by Vladimir as a "malicious anti-Soviet piece" and an "insult to the Soviet government, Soviet leaders, and the Soviet people." Vladimir threatened, "If Xie Wenqing engages in similar activities in the future, the Soviet side will take necessary measures." He then read out a statement, declaring that from that day forward, "it is prohibited" for Chinese journalists to take photographs in Moscow and other parts of the Soviet Union.

Xie Wenqing immediately and resolutely rejected Vladimir's unreasonable accusations and strongly protested the Soviet side's arbitrary stripping of Chinese journalists' legitimate right to take photographs in the Soviet Union. He also exposed the recent crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist authorities in instigating thugs to assault Chinese journalists and brutally obstructing Chinese journalists' normal reporting activities. He said, "All news reports sent by Chinese journalists from Moscow are strictly based on facts. On January 25th, 29th, and February 3rd, when Chinese journalists were taking photographs in Moscow's Red Square, at the airport, and even on the territory of the Chinese Embassy, they not only faced rude interference but were also beaten, with their cameras destroyed and flashlights stolen." Xie Wenqing asked Vladimir, "Can you point out a single word or sentence in our reports that does not conform to the facts?" Vladimir evaded Xie Wenqing's questions and exposures, refusing to give a direct answer.

That same afternoon, Bekov also notified the Xinhua News Agency's correspondent Ding Xiangqi by telephone of the Soviet side's unreasonable decision to prohibit Chinese journalists from taking photographs in the Soviet Union.

On February 15th, Chen Weifan, Deputy Director of the Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, summoned Soviet Embassy Press Attaché Smirnov to lodge the strongest protest against the Soviet government's arbitrary announcement prohibiting Chinese journalists from taking photographs in the Soviet Union, expressing great indignation. Chen Weifan pointed out that this is another new crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique in their deliberate attempt to further deteriorate the relations between the two countries.

In his protest, Chen Weifan said, "The Soviet government has long imposed various unreasonable restrictions and discriminations on Chinese journalists, and after recently committing fascist barbaric acts against Chinese journalists, it now strips our journalists of their legitimate right to conduct reporting and photography activities. These actions fully prove your extreme weakness and panic. You fear the truth, fear the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fear our journalists truthfully reporting your crazy anti-China, anti-revolution, and anti-people facts, and fear them exposing your traitorous faces of betraying Marxism-Leninism."

Chen Weifan refuted the Soviet government's fabricated lie that the Chinese government has prohibited Soviet journalists and all other foreign journalists from taking photographs in Chinese territory. Chen Weifan solemnly pointed out that the Chinese government has never prohibited Soviet journalists and other foreign journalists from conducting normal photography activities in Chinese territory. You fabricate things out of nothing, trying to use the so-called "principle of reciprocity" to strip our journalists of their legitimate right to take photographs, which is utterly futile.

Chen Weifan solemnly declared that the Soviet government must immediately revoke its unreasonable decision to prohibit Chinese journalists from conducting legitimate photography activities in the Soviet Union and must genuinely guarantee the personal safety of Chinese journalists during various reporting activities. Otherwise, the Soviet authorities must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences that may arise.

Previously, Deputy Counselor Miao Qun of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union had summoned Soviet Foreign Ministry Press Department Deputy Director Khazov on the afternoon of February 13th to lodge the strongest protest against the Soviet government's arbitrary announcement prohibiting Chinese journalists from taking photographs in the Soviet Union and solemnly stated that the Soviet government's decision is groundless and absolutely unacceptable.

In the protest, the Chinese Embassy pointed out that the Soviet side's claim that "China has prohibited Soviet journalists in Beijing from taking photographs in Chinese territory" is a complete fabrication. Your newspapers are filled with photographs taken by your journalists in China, yet your government spreads the rumor that China does not allow your journalists to take photographs in China. Isn't this a case of shooting yourselves in the foot?

Khazov and the Soviet Foreign Ministry Counselor Bekov present tried every means to defend the Soviet authorities' unreasonable measures, but they were at a loss for words and full of loopholes.

    苏修领导必须承担进一步恶化中苏关系的罪责
    我外交部新闻司、驻苏使馆和驻苏记者最强烈抗议苏修当局无理剥夺我驻苏记者拍摄照片的正当权利
    新华社十六日讯　苏联修正主义当局在九日无理宣布剥夺我国驻莫斯科记者在苏联领土上拍摄照片的正当权利。这是苏修领导集团蓄意进一步恶化两国关系的又一新的罪行。对此，我国外交部新闻司、我国驻苏联大使馆和我国驻莫斯科记者，分别向苏联有关方面提出了最强烈的抗议。
    苏联外交部一等秘书弗拉基米罗夫和贝科夫，九日中午约见《人民日报》驻莫斯科记者谢文清。弗拉基米罗夫首先代表苏联外交部新闻司提出一项“警告”，大肆攻击《人民日报》二月六日发表的一篇如实地报道苏修领导集团二月三日指使暴徒闯入中国驻苏联大使馆领土，砸坏和抢劫大使馆新闻展览橱窗，毒打中国外交代表和工作人员的通讯《这笔新的血债一定要讨还！》，诬蔑这篇通讯是什么“恶毒的反苏文章”，是什么“侮辱苏联政府、苏联领导人和苏联人民”。弗拉基米罗夫威胁说，“如果谢文清在今后的活动中再发生类似情况，苏联方面还将采取必要的措施”。接着，他又宣读一项声明，说什么自即日起，“禁止”中国记者在莫斯科和苏联其他领土上拍摄照片。
    谢文清当即坚决拒绝弗拉基米罗夫的无理指责，并且坚决抗议苏联方面无理剥夺中国记者在苏联拍照的正当权利。他还揭露了苏修当局最近指使暴徒殴打中国记者、蛮横阻挠中国记者的正常采访活动的罪行。他说，中国记者发自莫斯科的一切新闻报道都是严格尊重事实的。中国记者一月二十五日、二十九日和二月三日在莫斯科红场、机场甚至在中国大使馆领土上拍照时，不但受到粗暴干涉，而且遭到毒打，照相机被打毁，闪光灯被抢走。谢文清质问弗拉基米罗夫，他能不能在中国记者的报道中指出不符合事实的一个字或一句话来？弗拉基米罗夫极力回避谢文清所提出的质问和揭露，不敢正面回答。
    当天下午，贝科夫又把苏联方面禁止中国记者在苏联拍照的无理决定，用电话通知新华社驻莫斯科记者丁翔起。
    中华人民共和国外交部新闻司副司长陈维帆，十五日召见苏联驻中国大使馆新闻专员斯米尔诺夫，就苏联政府蛮横宣布禁止中国记者在苏联领土上拍照一事，提出了最强烈的抗议，并且表示极大的愤慨。陈维帆指出，这是苏修领导集团蓄意进一步恶化两国关系的又一新的罪行。
    陈维帆在抗议中说，苏联政府长期以来对中国记者进行了种种无理限制和歧视，最近在对中国记者采取了法西斯野蛮暴行之后，又剥夺我们记者进行采访拍照活动的正当权利。这些行动充分证明了你们极端虚弱和恐慌。你们害怕真理，害怕伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，害怕我们的记者如实报道你们疯狂反华、反革命、反人民的真相，害怕他们揭露出你们背叛马克思列宁主义的叛徒嘴脸。
    陈维帆驳斥了苏联政府捏造的所谓中国政府禁止苏联记者和其他一切外国记者在中国领土上拍照的无耻谎言。陈维帆严正指出，中国政府从未禁止苏联记者和其他外国记者在中国领土进行正常的拍照活动。你们无中生有地想用所谓“对等原则”来剥夺我记者进行拍照的正当权利，完全是徒劳的。
    陈维帆郑重声明，苏联政府必须立即撤销无理禁止中国记者在苏联正当拍照活动的决定，并切实保证中国记者在进行各种采访活动时的人身安全，否则由此产生的一切严重后果苏联当局必须承担全部责任。
    在这以前，中国驻苏联大使馆一等秘书缪群，曾在十三日下午约见苏联外交部新闻司司长助理哈佐夫，对苏联政府宣布无理禁止中国记者在苏联领土上拍照一事提出最强烈的抗议，并且郑重表示，苏联政府的这个决定是毫无根据的，是绝对不能接受的。
    中国大使馆在抗议中指出，苏联方面所谓“中国已经禁止苏联驻北京记者在中国领土上拍照”的说法是彻头彻尾的捏造。苏联的报纸大量刊登你们记者在中国拍下的照片，而你们的政府却造谣说中国不准你们的记者在中国拍照，你们这不是自打嘴巴吗？
    哈佐夫和在场的苏联外交部一等秘书贝科夫千方百计地为苏联当局的无理措施辩解，但是，他们理屈词穷，漏洞百出。
