The great storm of the "January Revolution" is sweeping the nation. How to deal with revolutionary cadres, especially revolutionary leading cadres, and how to give full play to their role in the struggle for seizure of power, has become a very important and urgent problem that needs to be solved. Whether or not to implement the combination of revolutionary mass organizations, military representatives, and revolutionary leading cadres, whether or not to value the role of revolutionary cadres in the struggle for seizure of power, is the key to whether we can successfully complete the seizure of power and consolidate it. It is an important sign of whether we are seizing power according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or seizing power in violation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Numerous facts have taught us, and the experiences and lessons of many places have told us: wherever the "three-in-one combination" of revolutionary mass organization leaders, military representatives, and revolutionary leading cadres has been implemented, the seizure of power has been successful. The proletarian revolutionary masses have truly seized power, established revolutionary authority, and led the broad masses of revolutionary people to seize new victories and establish a new order of proletarian revolution. On the contrary, in some units, because the "three-in-one combination" has not been implemented, especially the combination with revolutionary leading cadres, although power has been seized, the leadership has not been truly grasped, revolutionary authority has not been established, and it is not possible to "grasp revolution and promote production" well, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to develop in depth. All genuine revolutionary leftists and revolutionary organizations must pay high attention to this issue and must not treat it lightly.

However, there are still many wrong views and confused understandings about this issue that need to be corrected.

"They are the people in power!" Regarding the people in power, a class analysis should be conducted to distinguish who are the proletarian people in power and who are the bourgeois people in power, who support and implement the proletarian revolutionary line and who support and implement the bourgeois reactionary line. To think that as long as they are people in power, they should all be distrusted, without distinguishing right from wrong, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything, is anarchism, is adventurism, is pseudo-leftism and rightism in essence, and is completely contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. It will inevitably abandon a large number of revolutionary leading cadres, seriously damage the party's precious assets, lose the support of the majority of the masses, and fall into an isolated situation. This anarchism will inevitably lead to mutual exclusion and overthrow among mass organizations, which is a very dangerous trend.

"They all implemented the bourgeois reactionary line." This is a generalization from a single case and does not see that our party has many leading cadres who, for a long time, have stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and have fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line. They are good cadres who have been tempered and tested in the long-term struggle under the cultivation and guidance of Chairman Mao. Not seeing this is a big mistake. Even for those leading cadres who have made mistakes by implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, they should be treated differently. We should distinguish whether they are conscious or unconscious; whether the mistakes are big or small, long-term and consistent or short-term and partial; whether their attitude towards mistakes is stubbornly persistent or acknowledging and correcting mistakes. We must not treat them indiscriminately, lump them together, and throw them all away. The correct approach is to firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," to "clarify thoughts and unite comrades," to allow them to correct their mistakes, encourage them to redeem themselves, and allow them to revolutionize. We must not become new "running dogs"!

"They themselves do not stand up!" Many leading cadres are afraid of criticism, afraid of the masses, and dare not stand up in the great proletarian cultural revolution, and thus receive criticism and education from the masses, which is appropriate. This cultural revolution is a new and severe test for them. However, comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction should also learn to do detailed political and ideological work. For those leading cadres who are not capitalist-roaders, do not stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, and are determined to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we should actively and enthusiastically help and encourage them not to lie on their past merits but to establish new merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In short, we should both struggle with them and unite with them, both criticize them sharply and help them warmly, so that they can stand up and dare to stand up.

"We are in a den of thieves, all rotten, and can only be overthrown!" In some departments and units, there are many capitalist-roaders within the party, and they hold important positions. This phenomenon exists. However, it should be seen that these capitalist-roaders are still a small handful, and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line are even fewer. To regard a department or unit as an iron block, thinking that all leading cadres are capitalist-roaders and are all the same in their stubbornness and unwillingness to change, is wrong and does not conform to objective reality. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction "must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should we look at a cadre's momentary actions, but we should also look at a cadre's entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." To achieve this, all comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction must fully mobilize the broad masses of revolutionary people, use great democracy, and carry forward the spirit of "daring to speak out, dare to act, dare to rebel, dare to make revolution, and dare to struggle," to identify leading cadres, support those proletarian revolutionary cadre, unite with those who have made mistakes but are willing to revolutionize and have shown some signs of doing so, and isolate the small handful of capitalist-roaders and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line.

Chairman Mao said: "Policy is the starting point of all practical actions of a revolutionary party, and it is manifested in the process and outcome of action." The current great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary faction is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle; after the seizure of power, it is also an extremely arduous and heavy task to firmly grasp and consolidate power. To achieve the final and complete victory of this struggle, the proletarian revolutionary faction must firmly stand on the position of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unconditionally act according to Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies, and must strictly distinguish between enemies and friends, and firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, they must be firmly overthrown and power must be completely seized; for those cadres who have made general mistakes, the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity" should be adopted; for those revolutionary cadres who stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they must be firmly relied upon and fought shoulder to shoulder, and they should be recognized as the backbone and leaders of the struggle for seizure of power. In this process, we must also be particularly alert to Khrushchev-like careerists and conspirators, prevent such bad elements from infiltrating our ranks, disrupting our lines, and usurping the leadership of the party and the state at all levels.

All revolutionary comrades must learn to use the method of class analysis to analyze everything, observe everything, and solve many new problems that arise in the struggle. All revolutionary comrades must learn revolutionary dialectics, overcome metaphysics, overcome one-sidedness and subjectivism, and improve proletarian scientificness, so that we can become more mature; all revolutionary comrades must break down the "self" and establish the "public." Because only when we possess proletarian revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, can we fully recognize the role of revolutionary cadres in the struggle for seizure of power, can we seriously implement "three-in-one combination, united seizure of power," can we unconditionally execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and can we carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

All revolutionary comrades, take action! Let us, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive unremittingly to complete the struggle for seizure of power and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    必须充分重视革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用
    《首都红卫兵》报社论
    伟大的“一月革命”风暴正在席卷全国。如何对待革命干部，特别是革命的领导干部，如何发挥他们在夺权斗争中的作用，已经作为一个十分重要的亟需解决的问题被提到议事日程上。实行不实行与革命领导干部的结合，重视不重视革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用，是能否胜利地完成夺取政权、巩固政权的关键，是区分到底按照毛主席的革命路线进行夺权，还是违背毛主席的革命路线进行“夺权”的重要标志。
    无数的事实教育了我们，许多地方的经验和教训告诉了我们：凡是实行了革命群众组织负责人、驻军负责人和革命领导干部的“三结合”的“三位一体，联合夺权”的地方，那里的夺权就成功了。无产阶级革命派真正掌了权，建立了革命权威，并领导广大革命群众去夺取新胜利，去建立无产阶级革命的新秩序。相反，有些单位，由于没有实行“三结合”，特别是没有实行和革命领导干部的结合，虽然夺了权，领导权却没有真正掌握住，没有建立起革命的权威，也就不能很好地“抓革命，促生产”，推动无产阶级文化大革命向纵深发展。一切真正的革命左派同志和革命组织对这个问题必须予以高度注意，千万不能等闲视之。
    但是目前对这个问题，还有许多错误观点和糊涂认识，必须予以纠正。
    “他们是当权派！”对于当权派应该进行阶级分析，应该分辨谁是无产阶级当权派，谁是资产阶级当权派，谁是拥护和执行无产阶级革命路线，谁是拥护和执行资产阶级反动路线。认为只要是当权派，就一概不相信，不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，这是无政府主义，是盲动主义，是形“左”实右，是完全违背毛泽东思想的。它势必抛弃一大批革命领导干部，严重损害党的宝贵财富，使自己失去大多数群众的拥护，陷于孤立的困境。这种无政府主义还势必要发展到群众组织互相排斥，互相打倒，这是极其危险的倾向。
      “他们都执行了资产阶级反动路线。”这是以偏概全，根本没有看到我们党有许多领导干部，长时期以来站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行过斗争。他们是在毛主席培养教导下、在多年斗争实践中锻炼和考验出来的好干部。看不到这一点是一个绝大错误。即使对于那些曾经执行过资产阶级反动路线犯有错误的领导干部，也应该区别对待。要区别他们是自觉还是不自觉；要区别错误的程度，是大还是小，是长期一贯还是短期局部；要区别他们对错误的态度，是顽固坚持还是承认错误改正错误。决不能不加区别，笼统对待，彼此一样，一律抛开。正确的作法是，坚决按照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”，允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪，允许他们革命，我们决不能当新的“假洋鬼子”！
      “他们自己不挺身而出！”许多领导干部“怕”字当头，害怕批评，害怕群众，在轰轰烈烈的文化大革命中不敢挺身而出，因而受到群众的批评教育，是应该的。这场文化大革命对他们是一次新的严峻的考验。但是，无产阶级革命派的同志，还应该学会做细致的政治思想工作。对于那些不是走资本主义道路的当权派，不顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线，决心回到毛主席革命路线上来的领导干部，要主动地热情地帮助，鼓励他们不要躺在过去的成绩上，应该为无产阶级文化大革命建立新的功劳。总之，对他们应该既有斗争又有团结，既有尖锐的批评又有热情的帮助，使他们能够站起来，勇于站起来。
      “我们这里是黑窝，都烂掉了，只能一律打倒！”一些部门，一些单位，党内走资本主义道路的当权派较多，而且把持了重要地位，这种现象是存在的。但是，应该看到这种走资本主义道路的当权派也还是一小撮，顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的仍是极少数。把一个部门和单位看成铁板一块，认为所有领导干部都是走资本主义道路当权派，都是一样的坚持不改和屡教不改，这是不对的，是不符合客观实际的。无产阶级革命派的同志“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”为了做到这一点，一切无产阶级革命派的同志，必须充分发动广大革命群众，运用大民主，发扬“五敢”精神，对领导干部加以鉴别，支持那些无产阶级革命派干部，团结那些犯有错误但愿意革命且有所表现的干部，孤立极少数走资本主义道路当权派和执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。
    毛主席说：“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿。”当前的无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权，是一场极为尖锐极为复杂的阶级斗争；夺权之后要牢牢地掌握政权和巩固政权也是极为艰巨极为繁重的任务。要取得这个斗争的最后的完全的胜利，无产阶级革命派必须坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线的立场上，不折不扣地按照毛泽东思想办事，按照党的方针政策办事，必须严格地区分敌我友，坚决贯彻毛主席制定的干部政策。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，只能坚决打倒，彻底夺权；对那些犯有一般错误的干部，就应该采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针；对站在毛主席革命路线一边的革命干部则必须坚决依靠，并肩战斗，应该承认他们可以成为夺权斗争中的骨干和领导。在这个过程中，也要特别警惕赫鲁晓夫式的野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人钻进我们的队伍，搅乱我们的阵线，篡夺党和国家的各级领导。
    一切革命派的同志，必须学会用阶级分析方法去分析一切，观察一切，解决斗争中提出的许多新问题。一切革命同志，必须学会革命辩证法，克服形而上学，克服片面性、主观性，提高无产阶级的科学性，使我们更加成熟起来；一切革命同志，必须大破“私”字，大立“公”字。因为我们只有具备了无产阶级革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，才能充分认识革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用，才能认真实行“三位一体，联合夺权”，才能不折不扣地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    一切革命同志行动起来！让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，为胜利完成夺权斗争、为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底而不懈地奋斗！
