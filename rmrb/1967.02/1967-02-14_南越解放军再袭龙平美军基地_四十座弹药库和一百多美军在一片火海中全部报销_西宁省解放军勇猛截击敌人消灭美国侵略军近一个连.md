The South Vietnamese Liberation Army once again launched a fierce attack on the Dragon Valley U.S. logistics base in the early hours of February 4, destroying 40 ammunition depots and 22 military vehicles of various types, and killing 107 U.S. aggressors. The report said that under the fierce attack of the liberation forces, the entire Dragon Valley military base instantly turned into a sea of fire, with explosions shaking the heavens and the earth, and the flames burning until 5:30 PM before being extinguished.

The Dragon Valley U.S. logistics base is located about 20 kilometers northeast of Saigon and is one of the major ammunition depots for U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam. Since October 28, 1966, the liberation forces have attacked this base four times. In these four attacks, the liberation forces have destroyed a total of 48 ammunition depots and 43 military vehicles, and killed or wounded nearly 500 U.S. aggressors.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army in Xining Province severely punished the U.S. aggressors on February 10, annihilating nearly a company of enemy forces, destroying six enemy tanks, and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies.

On February 10, U.S. aggressors stationed in the Loe Gai area of Xining Province went to the Sa Minh River area to cause trouble. The highly vigilant liberation forces in Xining Province immediately launched a fierce interception of the enemy, achieving the above-mentioned brilliant results.

According to another report, the guerrilla forces in Luc Giang, An Ninh, and Hop Hoa communes of De And District, Thua Thien Province, continuously intercepted the "sweeping" U.S. and puppet troops from February 2 to 7, killing or wounding nearly 100 U.S. and puppet troops, and destroying or damaging 14 enemy vehicles.
