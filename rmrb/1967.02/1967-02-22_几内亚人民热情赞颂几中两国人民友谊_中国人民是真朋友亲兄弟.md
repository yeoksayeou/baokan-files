The Guinean government plans to build a hydroelectric power station near the Kankan Falls to solve the power supply problems of several major cities in the central region. However, Kankan is located in a mountainous area far from the Guinean capital, Conakry, over 400 kilometers away, with all roads being mountainous. Additionally, six months of the year are the rainy season, making transportation extremely difficult. During the colonial era, French colonialists claimed that it was "impossible to build a power station in Kankan." After Guinea gained independence, many imperialist and revisionist countries sent experts to survey Kankan, but they showed no interest in this barren and remote area.

The Chinese government, in accordance with the economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries, firmly fulfilled the ardent wishes of the Guinean people and took on the challenging task of building the Kankan hydroelectric power station. After a short period of surveying and designing, the construction of the Kankan power station, entirely built with Chinese aid, began in July 1964. Through the arduous efforts of workers from both countries, the power station was completed ahead of schedule, adding a new glorious chapter to the great Sino-Guinean friendship. The Guinean side praised, "Such high speed has never been seen before."

During the construction process, all experts and technical personnel strictly followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people of the whole world," embodying the spirit of internationalism and the revolutionary tenacity of not fearing hardship or difficulty. They braved wind and rain, endured the scorching sun, did not take holidays during the Spring Festival, did not rest on Sundays, and worked day and night at their respective posts.

Chinese experts and workers strictly adhered to the eight principles of China's foreign aid, enthusiastically training Guinean workers and selflessly imparting technology to them, cultivating a technical team for Guinea. Now, after being patiently trained by Chinese experts, 470 people have mastered 27 different skills to a proficient level. A Guinean bulldozer operator said, "I learned from the Soviets for three years and still couldn't drive, but with the Chinese experts, I could work in just one month. I will never forget this."

Chinese experts and workers established deep friendships with Guinean workers through their joint labor. Guinean workers often told Chinese experts, "You are experts sent by Chairman Mao, true friends, and brothers. We trust you. We want to work with you for a lifetime." They raised the hands of Chinese experts and said, "Your hands are laboring hands, while the hands of the French colonialists are hands that wield whips."

The Guinean people, through their personal experiences, have come to recognize who their true enemies and friends are and have learned to adopt different attitudes towards enemies and friends. The former district chief of Pita, now Mayor of Conakry, Sanyu Mamadi, pointing to a bridge built by Chinese experts near the Kankan hydroelectric power station, said, "This is the fruit of labor of the peoples of China and Guinea." He then pointed to a small, dilapidated wooden bridge upstream and said, "That is the result of sixty years of colonialist rule. If French people come to visit, I will lead them across that small wooden bridge." When talking about the betrayal of the African and Asian peoples' revolutionary cause by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, he pointed out, "Since they have betrayed 700 million people in China, why wouldn't they betray 3 million people in Guinea? What they did in Albania, they can do in other countries. We are very clear about this."

The completion of the Kankan hydroelectric power station is a testament to the hard work of the peoples of China and Guinea, a new achievement of friendly cooperation between the two countries, and a symbol of the ever-brightening friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea. As a Guinean friend said, the waters of the Koukoulou River flow endlessly, the power generation of the Kankan power station will never stop, and the Sino-Guinean friendship will shine forever.

    几内亚人民热情赞颂几中两国人民友谊
    中国人民是真朋友亲兄弟
    据新华社科纳克里电　几内亚政府想在金康瀑布附近修建一个水力发电站，解决中部几个主要城市的用电问题。但是金康地处高山深谷，离几内亚首都科纳克里港口四百多公里，全部是山路，再加上一年中六个月是雨季，运输十分困难。殖民统治时代，法国殖民主义者断言：在金康“无法修水电站”。几内亚独立后，好多帝国主义和修正主义国家派出专家去金康勘察，它们对这荒山僻野的不毛之地都“不感兴趣”。
    中国政府根据中几两国的经济技术合作协定，坚决满足几内亚人民的殷切愿望，把在金康修建水电站的困难任务承担了下来。经过短期的勘察、设计，全部由中国援建的金康水电站的工程，就在一九六四年七月动工了。经过中几两国员工艰苦奋战，水电站终于提前完工，为伟大的中几战斗友谊又写下了新的光辉一页。几内亚方面赞扬说，“这样高速度，从来未见过。”
    在施工过程中，全体专家和技术人员事事处处遵循毛主席“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的教导，发扬了国际主义和不怕苦、不怕难的英勇顽强的革命精神。他们冒风雨，顶烈日，春节不放假，星期日不休息，不分昼夜地奋战在各自的岗位上。
    中国专家和工人严格遵照我国援外八项原则，热情地培训几内亚工人，无私地向他们传授技术，为几内亚培养了一支技术队伍。现在，经过中国专家耐心培养，已经有四百七十多人分别学到二十七种工种的技术，达到熟练的水平。一位几内亚推土机手说：“我跟苏联人学了三年还不会开，跟中国专家一个月就能工作。对这一点我永远忘不了。”
    中国专家和工人同几内亚工人在一起劳动中建立了深厚的友谊。几内亚工人经常对中国专家说：“你们是毛主席派来的专家，是真朋友，亲兄弟，我们信得过。我们愿与你们一起工作一辈子。”他们举起中国专家的手说：“你们的手是劳动的手，法国殖民者的手是拿鞭子的手。”
    几内亚人民从自己的亲身经历中，认清了谁是几内亚真正的敌人，谁是真正朋友，并且学会了对付敌人和朋友的两种不同的态度。原皮塔区区长、现任科纳克里市市长萨纽·马马迪指着中国专家在金康水电站附近修建的一座桥说：“这是几中两国人民劳动的结晶。”他又指着上游的一座小破木桥说：“那是殖民主义统治六十年的成绩，如果有法国人来参观，我就领他们走那小木桥。”他在谈到苏联修正主义统治集团背叛亚非人民革命事业时指出：“他们既然背叛七亿人口的中国，难道就不会背叛三百万人口的几内亚吗？他们在阿尔巴尼亚干的事，在其它国家也干得出来，我们很清楚。”
    金康水电站的建成，是中几两国人民辛勤劳动的结晶，是两国友好合作的新成果，它象征着中几两国人民的友谊又放出新的光芒。正如一位几内亚朋友说的，科库洛河水长流不息，金康水电站的发电也永远不断，中几友谊将永放光芒。
