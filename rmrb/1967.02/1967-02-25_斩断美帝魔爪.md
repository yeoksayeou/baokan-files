Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the whole world."

The facts in Cambodia, Pakistan, the United Arab Republic, and Yemen have once again proven Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

With regard to these independent countries in Asia and Africa, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, uses its lackeys to carry out open armed invasions and military threats, and on the other hand, uses its spy agencies and "aid" agencies to engage in subversive activities. Its methods are both overt and covert, and its goals are to strangle the national independence of Asian and African countries and force them to be enslaved and controlled by U.S. neocolonialism.

The aggression, provocation, and threats of U.S. imperialism against independent countries in Asia and Africa show that after achieving national independence, these countries still face the serious task of maintaining and consolidating their independence. They must not relax their vigilance against the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism and must be ready at any time to wage a resolute struggle.

To smash the aggressive plots of external enemies, independent countries in Asia and Africa must also thoroughly eliminate internal enemies. This is because U.S. imperialism often uses its agents to subvert independent countries in Asia and Africa from within. From 1960 to the present, imperialism has carried out more than sixty coups in Asian and African countries. In some countries, not only has national independence been strangled, but their leaders have also fallen victim to the imperialists' poisonous hands. This is a lesson that all independent countries in Asia and Africa must learn.

However, the subversive plots of U.S. imperialism against Asian and African countries can only further expose its aggressive nature and arouse greater resistance and struggle from the people of these countries. One day, they will surely bury this vicious pest for good.

    斩断美帝魔爪
    毛主席说：“美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。”
    在柬埔寨、巴基斯坦、阿联和也门发生的事实，再一次证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    对于这些亚非独立国家，美帝国主义一方面利用它的走狗进行公开的武装入侵和军事威胁，另一方面利用它的间谍机构、“援助”机构进行颠覆活动。其手段有文有武，其方式或明或暗，目的都是为了扼杀亚非国家的民族独立，迫使它们受美国新殖民主义的奴役和控制。
    美帝国主义对亚非独立国家的侵略、挑衅和威胁，说明亚非国家在取得民族独立以后，仍然面临着保持独立和巩固独立的严重任务。它们决不能对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋放松警惕，必须随时准备进行坚决的斗争。
    为了粉碎外部敌人的侵略阴谋，亚非独立国家还必须同时彻底肃清内部的敌人。因为美帝国主义常常利用它的代理人从内部来颠覆亚非独立国家。从一九六○年到现在，帝国主义在亚非国家搞了六十多次政变。其中有些国家，不但民族独立遭到扼杀，而且连它们的领导人也惨遭帝国主义的毒手。这是所有亚非独立国家不能不引为教训的。
    但是，美帝国主义对亚非国家的颠覆阴谋，只能更加暴露它的侵略本性，激起亚非国家人民更大的反抗和斗争。他们总有一天要彻底埋葬这个穷凶极恶的害人虫。
