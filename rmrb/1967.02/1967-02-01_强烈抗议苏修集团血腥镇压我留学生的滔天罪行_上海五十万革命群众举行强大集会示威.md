Shanghai's 500,000 Revolutionary Masses Hold a Powerful Rally and Demonstration

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 31st: 500,000 revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses from Shanghai and other places in Shanghai held another grand rally and demonstration today titled "Strongly Protest the Soviet Revisionists' Fascist Atrocities of Bloody Suppression of Our Students in Europe." This brought the continuous protests in Shanghai against the new provocations by the Soviet revisionist scoundrels to a new high. The meeting solemnly pointed out that after the fascist atrocities in Red Square, the Soviet revisionist scoundrels have once again incurred a new blood debt against the Chinese people in Iraq, once again exposing the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists who insist on being enemies of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. It fully exposed the weak essence of the Soviet revisionists' external strength and internal weakness, their desperate struggles. "All reactionaries are paper tigers." In the face of the great, invincible, brilliant, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and in the face of the great Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, the Soviet revisionist scoundrels, like American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, will not escape their ultimate doom.

Revolutionary rebel representatives from various fronts were indignant and condemned the new provocations by the Soviet revisionist scoundrels against the great Chinese people. They decided to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to raise the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism even higher, and to join the revolutionary people of the world to thoroughly smash the Soviet revisionist counter-revolutionary leadership clique, to thoroughly smash imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, and to "sweep away all harmful elements"!

Representatives of the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai workers and peasants praised our students in the face of the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities, fearlessly standing up to the fight, and passing a severe test of international class struggle. They are truly worthy students of Chairman Mao, truly strong anti-revisionist fighters of the proletariat, and truly outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.

The Red Guards' revolutionary young warriors warned Brezhnev, Kosygin, and other old scoundrels sternly: Those who suppress student movements will not have a good end! Those who betray the revolution will not have a good end! Our little red soldiers of Chairman Mao are not to be trifled with. We will not let you off. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. We will not only rebel against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, but also against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against the reactionaries of various countries. We will rebel to the end, and that will be victory!

The heroic fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought—representatives of 41 overseas Chinese youth who returned from Indonesia—said: Our beloved leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools." The Soviet revisionist scoundrels are willing to act as the henchmen of American imperialism and carry out fascist rule over the people, and they will not have a good end! The people of the world will not forgive you! The Soviet people with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution will surely rise up to rebel against you, seize your power, and smash you to pieces!

Representatives of students who returned from the Soviet Union after being brutally beaten by the Soviet revisionist scoundrels in March 1965 spoke indignantly at the meeting: The blood of our students has been spilled more than once on the streets of Moscow. He said that the masters of the Kremlin are so afraid of and so hate our students because our students are the youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the good students of Chairman Mao, and the sworn enemies of revisionism. They fear our students spreading the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought just as devils fear the sun. They fear our students spreading the great proletarian cultural revolution. However, as the great leader Mao Zedong taught: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." No matter how desperately the Soviet revisionist clique struggles and tries every means to obstruct the progress of the wheel of history, the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely shine over the land of the Soviet Union, and the great red flag of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly over the Kremlin.

Following this, the revolutionary masses burned the effigies of the Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the American imperialist leader Johnson in a roaring fire, turning them into ashes. At this moment, the square was filled with joy and satisfaction.

After the meeting, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses marched in different directions for demonstrations.

    强烈抗议苏修集团血腥镇压我留学生的滔天罪行
    上海五十万革命群众举行强大集会示威
    据新华社上海三十一日电　上海市、外地在沪的革命造反派和革命群众五十万人，今天再次举行声势浩大的“强烈抗议苏修血腥镇压我国留欧学生法西斯暴行”大会和示威游行，使连日来上海各路造反大军奋起痛击苏修混蛋新挑衅的抗议活动达到了一个新的高潮。大会严正指出，苏修混蛋继红场的法西斯暴行后，又在伊拉克对中国人民欠下了一笔新的血债，再一次暴露了苏修坚持与中国人民、世界革命人民为敌到底的叛徒嘴脸，充分暴露了苏修外强中干、垂死挣扎的虚弱本质。“一切反动派都是纸老虎”，在伟大的、战无不胜的、光芒万丈的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想面前，在伟大的中国人民和世界革命人民面前，苏修混蛋和美帝国主义以及各国反动派一样，都逃脱不了最后灭亡的命运。
    来自各条战线的革命造反派代表义愤填膺，纷纷在大会上强烈谴责苏修混蛋对伟大中国人民的新挑衅，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更高地举起反帝反修大旗，和全世界革命人民一起，彻底砸烂苏修反革命领导集团，彻底砸烂帝国主义和各国反动派，“扫除一切害人虫”！
    上海工人和农民革命造反派的代表在发言中赞扬我留学生在苏修的法西斯暴行面前，临危不惧，坚持斗争，经受了一次严峻的国际阶级斗争的考验，不愧为毛主席的好学生，不愧为无产阶级的坚强的反修战士，不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女。
    红卫兵革命小将在会上严厉警告勃列日涅夫、柯西金等老混蛋：凡是镇压学生运动的人都没有好下场，凡是背叛革命的人没有好下场！我们毛主席的红小兵是不好惹的，我们决不会放过你们，血债一定要用血来还。我们不但要造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，也要造帝国主义的反，造现代修正主义的反，造各国反动派的反。一反到底，就是胜利！
    用毛泽东思想武装的英雄战斗集体——从印尼归国四十一名华侨青少年的代表说：我们敬爱的领袖毛主席说过：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。”苏修混蛋甘心充当美帝国主义的帮凶，对人民进行法西斯统治，是决不会有好下场的！全世界人民决不会饶恕你们！具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民一定会起来造你们的反，夺你们的权！把你们这伙混蛋砸个稀巴烂！
    曾经在一九六五年三月遭到苏修混蛋野蛮殴打受伤回国的留苏学生代表在发言中愤慨地指出：我国留学生的鲜血已经不止一次洒在莫斯科的街头。他说，克里姆林宫的老爷们对我国留学生如此害怕，如此仇恨，这是因为我国留学生是用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年一代，是毛主席的好学生，是修正主义的死敌。他们象魔鬼害怕太阳那样，害怕我国留学生传播伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，害怕我国的无产阶级文化大革命。但是，正如伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”无论苏修集团怎样拚命挣扎，千方百计企图阻止历史车轮的前进，毛泽东思想的伟大光辉必将普照苏联的大地，战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗必将飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空。
    接着，革命群众把苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金和美帝国主义头子约翰逊的模拟象丢在熊熊烈火中烧成灰烬，这时，广场上一片欢腾，大快人心。
    大会结束后，数十万革命群众分路进行了示威游行。
