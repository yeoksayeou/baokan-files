The printing and dyeing workshop of the Sana'a Textile Mill, which was built with the aid of China, recently conducted trial production and successfully printed the first batch of printed fabric. This is the first time in Yemen's history that printed fabric has been produced. The Yemeni workers of the mill joyfully celebrated this victory.

A staff member named Abdulla Karim, who works in the printing and dyeing workshop, excitedly told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "We feel very proud. This is the fruit of Sino-Yemeni friendship. This is the result of the efforts of Chinese experts who have helped us. The Yemeni people, with the help of China, have for the first time learned how to produce printed fabric. This is a blow to the imperialists and colonialists."

Member of the Sana'a Textile Mill Management Committee Muhammad Hamadi said, "This trial printing was very successful, and this is inseparable from the efforts of the Chinese experts." He also said, "We have personally seen the Chinese experts in Yemen implementing Chairman Mao's teaching of serving the people of the world heart and soul. We have always believed that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the weapon of the Chinese people in their struggle but also the weapon of the people of the whole world in their struggle."

After hearing the news that the fabric they wove was printed for the first time, the Yemeni women workers in the textile mill rushed to the printing and dyeing workshop to offer their congratulations. They held up the printed fabric with both hands and praised it, saying, "It's beautiful, so beautiful!" Many people said: This is not just any printed fabric, it is the flower of Sino-Yemeni friendship, it embodies the friendship of the Sino-Yemeni peoples in their common labor.

    也门第一次生产自己的花布
    据新华社萨那电　由中国援助修建的也门萨那纺织厂印染车间最近进行试车性的试生产，成功地印出了第一批花布。这是也门历史上第一次生产出自己的花布。这个厂的也门职工兴奋地庆祝这一胜利。
    在印染车间工作的一位名叫阿卜杜拉·卡里姆的职员激动地对新华社记者说：“我们感到非常自豪。这是中也友谊的结晶。这是中国专家努力帮助我们的结果。也门人民在中国帮助下第一次知道怎样生产花布，这对帝国主义者和殖民主义者是一个打击。”
    萨那纺织厂管理委员会委员穆罕默德·哈玛迪说：“这次试验印花非常成功，这是和中国专家所做的努力分不开的。”他还说：“我们亲眼看到中国专家在也门执行毛主席的全心全意为世界人民服务的教导。我们一贯认为，毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的战斗武器，而且也是全世界人民的战斗武器。”
    在纺织厂工作的也门女工听说用她们纺织的布第一次印出花布的消息以后，纷纷跑到印染车间去表示祝贺。她们双手捧起花布，赞不绝口地说：“真美，美极了！”许多人都说：这不是一般的花布，这是中也人民友谊之花，它凝结着中也人民共同劳动的友谊。
