	Stand Up!
	Meng Jin

	Spring has returned, and the earth is warming. The vast countryside is about to enter the busy spring plowing season.

	The key to the year lies in spring. At this crucial moment, rural cadres at all levels should respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," stand on the front line, with high revolutionary enthusiasm and a serious sense of responsibility, and do a good job of preparing for spring plowing and production.

	Most of our revolutionary cadres have done this. However, there are still a few comrades who have knots in their minds and burdens on their spirits. Some are hesitant to lead, while others want to drop their responsibilities and not do anything.

	Some comrades complain: "I have no merits, but I have toil. I work hard for everyone, and now I am criticized by the masses." This thought is wrong. The masses have seen and remembered your good deeds in the past. However, we must not rest on our past merits and achievements, nor let them become obstacles to our progress, and even less use them as shields to reject criticism. Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and exposure." The masses criticizing you is not to deny your achievements but to help you make a revolution in your soul, to break down the selfishness and establish selflessness, so that you can see more clearly, have a redder heart, a stiffer spine, and more determined steps. After this bath, you will have a new appearance and more vigorous spirit, which is not better for serving the people? "Stagnant water becomes putrid, and the door hinge does not rot," think about it, how our era is advancing! We must only constantly correct our mistakes, overcome our shortcomings, and revolutionize ourselves to keep up with the pace of the times. As servants of the people, what reason do we have to reject criticism or feel wronged because of it?

	Some comrades say: "The masses have criticized me and posted big-character posters about me. Now, will they trust me if I stand up?" This thought is also wrong. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They know clearly who is good and who is bad, who is close to their hearts and who is not, who walks the same path as them and who tries to lead them astray. They thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road; they also criticize and give suggestions to cadres who make general mistakes. However, this criticism is not to strike you down and set you aside. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of their care and trust for you. If you accept everyone's criticism, sincerely reflect, and work actively, how can the masses not trust you?

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a severe test for everyone. If selfishness comes first, one will have a narrow mind, be anxious about gains and losses, and have many worries; if selflessness is the banner, one will have a broad mind, fear nothing, and march forward bravely!

	The spring plowing season does not wait for anyone. All revolutionary cadres in the countryside, and all cadres who have made general mistakes, should stand up, take immediate action, shoulder the responsibility, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness, establish selflessness, carry out the revolution, and promote production. Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, let us fire the first shot of spring plowing!

    挺身而出！
    孟进
    春回地暖。广大农村即将进入春耕的农忙季节。
    一年之计在于春。在这关键的时机，农村各级干部都应当响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，站在第一线，以高度的革命热忱，严肃负责的精神，抓好备耕工作和春耕生产。
    我们绝大多数的革命干部都这样做了。可是也有少部分的同志，思想上还有疙瘩，精神上还有包袱。他们有的缩手缩脚不敢领导，有的想撂挑子躺倒不干。
    有的同志颇有抱怨情绪地说：“没有功劳，也有苦劳。我起早摸黑为大伙，如今反而挨了群众不少批评。”这个想法不对。你过去为群众做了些好事，群众是看在眼里、记在心里的。但是我们绝不能躺在功劳成绩上面，绝不能让功劳成绩变成阻碍自己进步的绊脚石，更不能把功劳成绩当作拒绝批评的挡箭牌。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”群众批评你，绝不是一笔抹煞你的成绩，而是扶你一把，帮助你在灵魂深处闹革命，大破一个私字，大立一个公字，使你眼更亮，心更红，腰杆子更硬，步子更坚定。洗了这个澡，使你面貌为之一新，精神更加焕发，不是可以更好地为人民服务吗？“流水不腐，户枢不蠹”，想想吧，我们的时代正在以怎样的步伐前进！我们只有不断修正错误，克服缺点，不断革命，才能紧紧跟上时代的步伐。作为人民的勤务员，我们有什么理由拒绝批评，或者因此而感到委屈呢？
    有的同志这样说：“群众批评了我，贴了我的大字报，现在我站出来，他们还信任我吗？”这个想法也不对。农村中广大的贫下中农，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。谁个劣，谁个不劣，谁个与他们是心贴心的，谁个与他们不是一个心眼，谁个与他们走的是一条道，谁个想把他们引到邪路上去，他们是一清二楚的。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们是彻底揭露、坚决斗争的；对于犯有一般错误的干部，他们也提意见，也作批评，但是这个批评，不是为了打击你，把你撂在一边，恰恰相反，是爱护你、信任你的表现。如果你接受了大家的批评，诚恳检查，积极工作，群众怎么会不信任你呢！
    无产阶级文化大革命对每个人来说，都是一场严峻的考验。私字当头，就会胸襟狭窄，患得患失，顾虑重重；公字挂帅，就胸怀宽广，无所畏惧，勇往直前！
    春耕时节不等人。农村中一切革命的干部，一切犯有一般错误的干部，都要挺身而出，立即行动，挑起担子，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，大破私字，大立公字，大搞革命，狠促生产，和广大贫下中农一起，打响春耕第一炮！
