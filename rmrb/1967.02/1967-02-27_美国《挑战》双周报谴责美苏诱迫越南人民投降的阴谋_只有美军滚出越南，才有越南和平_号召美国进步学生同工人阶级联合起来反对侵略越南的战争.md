The U.S. "Challenge" bi-weekly denounces the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. Only when the U.S. troops withdraw from Vietnam will there be peace in Vietnam. It calls on American progressive students to unite with the working class to oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam.

London, February 24 (Xinhua) — The Progressive Labor Party of the United States calls on American progressive students to unite with the working class to jointly fight against U.S. imperialism and the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam.

The Progressive Labor Party's organ, the "Challenge" bi-weekly, published an article in its February issue stating that the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam is the most unpopular. More and more people have expressed opposition to this war of aggression. "More and more people are taking an anti-imperialist stance, demanding that the United States get out of Vietnam immediately."

The article emphasizes that the current task is to strengthen the role of the American working class in the movement against the war of aggression. The article says that only when the American people see the revolutionary power of the working class can they persist in the arduous political struggle.

The article calls on American students to fully support the various major strikes that will be held across the United States in 1967. The article says, "The recent action of students from Columbia University and City College going to Schenectady to support the strike of General Electric workers is a step in this direction."

London, February 24 (Xinhua) — The editorial in the February issue of the "Challenge" bi-weekly, the organ of the Progressive Labor Party of the United States, points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been closely colluding with the U.S. imperialists, attempting to induce the Vietnamese people to surrender. They are the most treacherous enemies of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

The editorial titled "Friends or Enemies?" points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in collusion with the U.S. imperialists, is plotting the "bombing halt and enticement" trick, which is "a cunning ploy played by the U.S. and the Soviet Union." The purpose is to sabotage the demands of the Vietnamese people and people all over the world for the U.S. aggressors to "get out of Vietnam immediately."

The editorial says that with the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, U.S. imperialism is coercing and enticing Vietnam into "negotiations," attempting to "obtain on the negotiating table what they absolutely cannot get on the battlefield." However, this is impossible.

The editorial stresses, "The Vietnamese people have repeatedly demonstrated the correctness and invincible power of people's war. They are facing the most elite troops and the best weapons of the United States, and they are striking hard at the U.S. aggressors. They have shown the world: revolutionary people can fight against U.S. imperialism and defeat it."

The editorial points out that the only way to achieve peace in Vietnam is for the U.S. aggressors to "get out of Vietnam immediately."

February 15, more than 2,000 American women demonstrated in front of the U.S. Department of Defense, protesting against the war of aggression in Vietnam.

    美国《挑战》双周报谴责美苏诱迫越南人民投降的阴谋
    只有美军滚出越南，才有越南和平
    号召美国进步学生同工人阶级联合起来反对侵略越南的战争
    新华社伦敦二十四日电　美国进步劳工党号召美国进步学生必须同工人阶级联合起来，为反对美帝国主义和美国侵略越南的战争而进行共同斗争。
    美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》双周报在二月份出版的一期里刊载一篇文章指出，美国对越南的侵略战争是最不得人心的。越来越多的人已经表示反对这场侵略战争，“越来越多的人采取了反帝的立场，要求美国马上滚出越南”。
    文章强调当前的任务是，要加强美国工人阶级在反对侵略战争运动中的作用。文章说，只有当美国人民看到工人阶级的革命力量时，他们才能坚持进行艰苦的政治斗争。
    文章号召美国学生全力支持一九六七年将在美国各地举行的各项大罢工。文章说，“哥伦比亚大学和市立学院的学生最近前往斯克内克塔迪，支持通用电气公司工人罢工的行动，就是向这个方向迈出的一步。”
    新华社伦敦二十四日电　美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》双周报二月份一期的社论指出，苏联修正主义领导集团一直在同美帝国主义者紧密勾结，企图诱使越南人民投降，他们是越南人民抗美救国事业的最阴险的敌人。
    这篇题为《是朋友还是敌人》的社论指出，苏联修正主义领导集团配合美帝国主义策划的“停炸诱和”的阴谋，是“美苏玩弄的狡猾的伎俩”，其目的在于破坏越南人民和全世界人民要美国侵略者“立即滚出越南”的正当要求。
    社论说，美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的帮助下，逼迫和诱骗越南“谈判”，企图“在谈判桌上得到他们在战场上绝对得不到的东西”。但是，这是决不能实现的。
    社论强调说：“越南人民已一再显示了人民战争的正确性和不可战胜的威力。他们所面对的是美国最精锐的部队和最优良的武器，他们正在狠狠地打击美国侵略者。他们向全世界表明：革命的人民是能够同美帝国主义作战，并把它打败。”
    社论指出，在越南实现和平的唯一出路，是美国侵略者“立即从越南滚出去。”
