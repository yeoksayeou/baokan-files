"The strike is justified, and the return to work is a right." Chinese workers employed at the Soviet Embassy in China today went to the Soviet Embassy to continue their struggle to return to work, strongly condemning the Soviet Embassy's shameful conspiracy of political retaliation.

At nine o'clock in the morning, all Chinese workers employed at the Soviet Embassy in China went to the Soviet Embassy, demanding to enter and negotiate with the responsible officials of the Soviet consular department. The Soviet side created numerous obstacles, refusing to let them in. Later, after a resolute struggle, the workers were able to enter the embassy. During the negotiations, the Soviet side slandered the workers' strike as "not a just action," refused to allow the Chinese workers to return to work, and used the excuse that the embassy "has no work" to attempt to dismiss the Chinese workers. They also absurdly claimed, "You don't need to return to work; we will continue to pay your salaries."

The Chinese workers indignantly pointed out to the Soviet side that the Soviet Embassy's refusal to allow Chinese workers to return to work and its attempt to dismiss them is a political retaliation by the Soviet side against the Chinese workers' just strike in protest of the Soviet revisionist authorities' savage suppression of our students. It is a political persecution of workers by the Soviet side, an insult to the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. They said: We, the workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand tall and firm. Our hearts are the reddest, our eyes are the brightest, and our bones are the hardest. No matter what tricks you play, we will not fall for them. We want to return to work, not for the sake of earning a few stinking Soviet rubles, but to defend our sacred rights and our dignity.

The workers' fighting spirit was high, and the struggle continued until late at night. At around ten o'clock in the evening, more than a hundred representatives of Chinese workers from seventy-four institutions in various countries in Beijing went to the Soviet Embassy in China to strongly protest the Soviet Embassy's persecution of Chinese workers and to express their resolute support for the workers' struggle to return to work.

    强烈谴责苏驻华使馆进行政治报复的可耻阴谋
    在苏使馆工作的我职工继续进行复工斗争
    新华社三日讯　“罢工有理，复工有权”。在苏联驻中国大使馆工作的中国职工，今天前往苏联驻中国大使馆继续进行复工斗争，强烈谴责苏联驻中国大使馆进行政治报复的可耻阴谋。
    上午九时，我国在苏联驻中国大使馆工作的全体职工，来到苏联大使馆，要求进馆和苏联领事部负责人谈判。苏方人员百般刁难，不让进去。后来，职工们经过坚决斗争，才进入使馆。在谈判中，苏方诬蔑工人罢工斗争“不是正义行动”，拒绝中国职工复工，并且以使馆“没有工作”为借口，企图解雇中国职工，他们还胡说什么“你们不要复工，我们照发工资”。
    中国职工愤慨地向苏方指出，苏联使馆拒绝中国职工复工和企图解雇他们，是苏方对中国职工为抗议苏修当局野蛮镇压我留学生而采取正义罢工进行的政治报复，是苏方在政治上对工人的迫害，是对中国工人阶级和中国人民的侮辱。他们说：我们这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人是顶天立地的，我们心最红，眼最亮，骨头最硬，不管你们耍什么鬼花招，我们决不会上你们的当。我们要复工，决不是为了挣苏修几个臭钱，而是为了维护我们神圣的权利，维护我们的尊严。
    工人们斗志昂扬，斗争直到深夜还在进行。晚上十点多钟，在各国驻北京的七十四个机构中工作的中国职工代表一百多人，前往苏联驻中国大使馆，强烈抗议苏联大使馆对中国职工的迫害，表示坚决支持职工们的复工斗争。
