The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army being a combat team, a work team, and a production team. While supporting the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary factions, they have dispatched large numbers of personnel to factories and rural areas in their garrison areas. There, they actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously support the revolutionary masses in grasping revolution and promoting production.

In recent days, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great directive on "grasping revolution and promoting production," as well as relevant editorials in the People's Daily. They unanimously believe that "grasping revolution and promoting production" is a great call and a crucial policy put forward by our most beloved and respected great leader, Chairman Mao. Attitudes towards this policy—whether one supports it, opposes it, or is indifferent—are a dividing line between revolutionaries, non-revolutionaries, and counter-revolutionaries. They say, we revolutionary soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and listen to his words the most. While firmly supporting the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary factions and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must also actively support the revolutionary masses and do a good job in production, striving for victory in both revolution and production. The soldiers and officers of a certain regiment said while studying Chairman Mao's great directive on "grasping revolution and promoting production," "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Stand firmly with the people of China, serve them wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army.' We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, serve the people wholeheartedly, support the proletarian revolutionary factions, and must, with practical actions, help the revolutionary masses grasp both revolution and production, foiling the enemy's schemes to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is our People's Liberation Army's unshakable political mission.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers first actively propagate Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promoting production" to the revolutionary masses in their garrison areas. They propagate the spirit of being pioneers in revolution and models in production, and the idea of not neglecting either revolution or production, but carrying both burdens on one shoulder. Some units also study Mao Zedong's works together with the revolutionary masses, analyzing the current situation of revolution and production. The soldiers and officers say, the greatest support is to arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought and promote ideological revolutionization. A certain unit's reconnaissance company, which has been rated as a four-good company for six consecutive years, formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. While studying Mao Zedong's works with the revolutionary peasants in the local production brigade, they also performed short and lively programs, propagating the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" to the local masses, greatly encouraging them. They said, the PLA comrades are heart to heart with us revolutionary peasants, we must grasp revolution and promote production vigorously. The soldiers and officers of a certain company in a certain unit went deep into the nearby production brigades, repeatedly propagating Chairman Mao's directive on "grasping revolution and promoting production" to the revolutionary peasants, and the importance of doing a good job in spring plowing to fire the first shot for agricultural production this year. With the help of the soldiers and officers, these production brigades launched a high tide of spring plowing. The revolutionary peasants in the garrison area of a certain company's third platoon exposed a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As the busy spring plowing season was approaching, these exposed bad elements incited social demons to spread cold winds everywhere, attempting to sabotage spring plowing, strike the revolutionary factions, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After discovering this, the soldiers and officers of the third platoon studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle with the revolutionary peasants, propagated Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production," and helped the revolutionary masses further see through the ugly face of the class enemy, forming a fervor of grasping revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary peasants said, we are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside, we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, grasp revolution, promote production, carry both burdens on one shoulder, and fire the first shot for spring plowing this year.

In recent days, many units have also provided large amounts of manpower and material support to factories and production brigades in their garrison areas. The "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," which is currently on a field exercise, saw the vigorous peasant movement in the suburbs of Shanghai, and everyone was excited, unanimously expressing that they should actively help the revolutionary peasants do a good job in production, achieving both revolutionary and productive victories. They used their spare time to help the local production brigade with water conservancy projects and river silt accumulation, receiving praise from the revolutionary peasants. The garrison troops in Qingdao learned that the Qingdao Port Bureau had heavy production tasks and immediately dispatched more than 300 cadres and soldiers and more than 30 vehicles to support them. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." They were not afraid of dirt or hard work, and actively took on loading and unloading tasks. Their actions deeply moved the revolutionary dock workers. A certain regiment, based on the needs of nearby production brigades, dispatched a large number of cadres and soldiers to help the production brigades with fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy projects, and tool repairs. The cadres and soldiers of the third platoon of this regiment, together with the revolutionary peasants, applied fertilizer to all the wheat fields in the production brigade in just two days. The logistics department of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region had already dispatched a large number of vehicles and personnel to help the revolutionary rebels transport more than 1,600 tons of materials during the period when a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the original Guizhou Provincial Committee and Guiyang Municipal Committee were spreading the black wind of economism. After the revolutionary rebels seized power, they again dispatched a large number of cadres to study Mao Zedong's works with the revolutionary rebels, grasp revolution, and promote production together. The cadres from the logistics department of the military region who were sent to a certain grain warehouse worked and studied Mao Zedong's "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas in the Party" and other works with the revolutionary rebels, discussed experiences, fought against selfishness, and summarized experiences, making the spiritual and work appearance of the comrades in this warehouse completely renewed.

    既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队
    解放军大力支援革命群众抓革命促生产
    广大指战员向驻地革命群众积极宣传毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，宣传搞好春耕生产的重要意义，并为驻地工厂和生产队提供了大批人力物力支援
    新华社十七日讯　人民解放军广大指战员坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，发扬人民解放军既是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队，又是一个生产队的光荣传统，在支持无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，抽出大批人员，到驻地工厂、农村，积极宣传毛泽东思想，大力支援革命群众狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    连日来，广大指战员，反复学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，和《人民日报》有关社论。他们一致认为，“抓革命，促生产”，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席提出的伟大号召，是一个极其重要的伟大方针。对于这个方针，采取什么态度，是拥护，还是不拥护，还是反对，是革命，不革命和反革命的一个分界线。他们说，我们革命战士，无限忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话。我们在坚决支持无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的同时，一定要最积极地支援革命群众，搞好生产，争取革命、生产双胜利。某团指战员，学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示时说，毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们遵循毛主席的教导，全心全意地为人民服务，支持无产阶级革命派，就要以实际行动，帮助革命群众抓好革命和生产这两个环节，粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋诡计。这是我们人民子弟兵义不容辞的政治任务。
    广大指战员首先向驻地的革命群众积极宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，宣传当抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范，革命、生产两不误，两副担子一肩挑的思想。有的部队还和革命群众共同学习毛主席著作，分析当前革命、生产的形势。指战员们说，千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，搞好思想革命化是最大的支援。连续六年评为四好连队的某部特务连，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，一面和驻地生产队的革命农民学习毛主席的著作，一面演出短小精悍的节目，向当地群众宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，使革命群众受到很大鼓舞。他们说，解放军同志和我们革命农民心连心，我们一定大抓革命、狠促生产。某部某连指战员，深入驻地附近的生产队，向革命农民反复宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，和搞好春耕生产，打响今年农业生产第一炮的重要意义。在指战员的帮助下，这些生产队掀起了春耕生产的高潮。某部三连驻地的革命农民，在无产阶级文化大革命中，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来。在春耕生产大忙季节即将到来的时刻，这些被揪出的坏家伙鼓动社会上的牛鬼蛇神，到处刮阴风，妄图破坏春耕生产，打击革命派，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。三连的指战员发现以后，就和革命农民一起学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，使革命群众进一步认清了阶级敌人的丑恶面目，形成了狠抓革命，猛促生产的热潮。革命农民说，我们是农村无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，一定要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓好革命，促进生产，革命、生产两副重担一肩挑，打响今年春耕生产第一炮。
    连日来，许多部队还为驻地工厂、生产队提供了大批的人力、物力支援。正在野营的“南京路上好八连”，看到上海郊区农民运动蓬勃兴起，个个心情振奋，一致表示，革命农民起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，我们应当积极帮助他们把生产搞好，做到革命、生产双丰收。他们利用空隙时间，帮助驻地生产队兴修水利、积河泥，受到革命农民的好评。驻青岛部队，了解到青岛港务局生产任务繁重，立即抽调三百多名干部战士、三十多辆汽车前往支援。他们牢记毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”不怕脏，不怕累，主动承担装卸任务。他们的行动，使革命码头工人深受感动。某团根据驻地附近生产队的需要，抽出大批干部战士，帮助生产队积肥，兴修水利，修理农具。这个团的三连干部战士和革命农民一起，仅仅两天的时间，就把生产队所有的麦地普遍追施了一次肥料。贵州省军区后勤部，早在原贵州省委和贵阳市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大刮经济主义黑风时期，就派出大量汽车和人员，帮助革命造反派运送物资一千六百多吨，有力地粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。革命造反派夺权以后，他们又抽出大批干部，和革命造反派一起学习毛主席著作，一起抓革命，促生产。被派到某粮食仓库去的军区后勤部的干部，和革命造反派一起工作，一起学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作，一块谈体会，斗私心，总结经验，使这个仓库的革命同志精神面貌和工作面貌焕然一新。（附图片）
