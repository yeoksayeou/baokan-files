The British government's defense white paper published today praises the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. It advocates for the joint reduction of armed forces by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, led by the United States, and the Warsaw Pact to further "ease" the situation in Europe. This is to facilitate the strategic shift of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to the East, jointly opposing the revolutionary peoples of China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries.

The white paper celebrates the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and their frenzied opposition to revolutionary socialist China. It states: "There are many reasons for NATO to be more confident in its assessment of Soviet intentions in 1967 than in 1949 or 1956 (when Khrushchev seized power)." The white paper believes this is because "important political and economic changes have taken place in Soviet society," and the Soviet government views China as "an unignorable factor."

The white paper believes that due to the changes in the Soviet Union, "the tension in Europe has eased," and NATO should adjust its strategy to "continue efforts to improve relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries." In this regard, the white paper particularly emphasizes that "the British government believes that the mutual reduction of armed forces by NATO and Warsaw Pact countries is the best way to achieve further political and military détente."

After the publication of the white paper by the Labour Party government, U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey immediately expressed interest in Britain's proposal.

The white paper reaffirms that the Labour Party government will strive to maintain its notorious "East of Suez" military policy to support U.S. military aggression in the Far East, while attempting to maintain the remnants of British imperialism's colonial foothold in the region with U.S. support.

Despite the severe financial and economic crises currently facing Britain, the Labour Party government, in order to maintain its shaky colonial rule overseas and suppress its own people, will still strengthen its military forces, raising the military expenditure for the 1967-1968 fiscal year to a new record of 2.205 billion pounds.

    英国政府为苏修复辟资本主义疯狂反华叫好
    鼓吹北大西洋集团和华沙条约组织共同削减军队“缓和”欧洲局势
    据新华社伦敦十六日电　英国工党政府今天发表的国防白皮书里为苏联出现资本主义复辟叫好。它鼓吹以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团和华沙条约组织共同削减武装部队，使欧洲局势进一步“缓和”，以便利美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团把战略重点东移，一起反对中国、越南和其他亚洲国家的革命人民。
    白皮书欢呼苏修叛变马克思列宁主义，疯狂反对坚持革命的社会主义中国。它说：“有许多理由使北大西洋公约组织在一九六七年对苏联意图的看法，比一九四九年或一九五六年（赫鲁晓夫刚篡夺政权时）更有把握。”白皮书认为，这是因为“苏联社会已经发生了重要的政治变化和经济变化”，同时苏联政府敌视中国，把中国看成是“不能忽视的一个因素”。
    白皮书认为，由于苏联的情况已经改变，“欧洲的紧张局势已经缓和”，北大西洋集团也应当调整它的战略，“继续努力改善同苏联和东欧国家之间的关系”。在这方面，白皮书特别强调说：“英国政府认为，北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约国家双方削减武装部队，是达成在政治上和军事上进一步和解的最好的办法。”
    工党政府的国防白皮书发表后，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基立刻表示，美国对英国这个主张很感兴趣。
    白皮书重申，英国工党政府要竭力保持臭名远扬的“苏伊士以东”军事政策，以配合美国在远东的军事侵略，同时妄图在美国支持下维持英帝国主义在这个地区的残存的殖民阵地。
    尽管英国目前财政、经济危机严重，但是工党政府为了维持在海外的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治以及镇压本国人民，仍然要加强军事力量，把一九六七——一九六八年度的军事费用，提高到二十二亿零五百万英镑的新纪录。
