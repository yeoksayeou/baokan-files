The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has further sold out to the U.S. imperialists and deliberately created a new anti-China incident.

China strongly protests the Soviet revisionist fascist atrocities.

The Chinese government has issued a solemn statement: The Soviet leadership clique organized thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy, beat up Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff, which is the most serious crime of violating the most basic diplomatic relations and Sino-Soviet relations. We warn the Soviet government that the patience of the Chinese people has its limits. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not intimidated by the fascist hatchet. All reactionaries who oppose the Chinese people will meet a bad end.

New China News Agency, February 5th

The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on February 5th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China

February 5, 1967

After the Soviet government sent troops and police to brutally suppress Chinese students on January 25, it again, on February 3, instigated thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, beating up Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff. This is a new anti-China incident deliberately created by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in further selling out to U.S. imperialism, an extremely serious provocation against socialist China and the great Chinese people. The Chinese government and people are greatly indignant and solemnly protest in the strongest and most resolute terms.

On the morning of February 3, Sudalikov, Director of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, summoned An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, and unreasonably demanded the immediate removal of the news picture windows of the Chinese Embassy, claiming arbitrarily that this issue was not open to discussion and that if the Chinese Embassy did not remove them, the Soviet side would take measures to remove them. That evening at 18:50 Moscow time, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique organized more than 160-170 plainclothes agents who suddenly arrived in cars at the gate of the Chinese Embassy, blocking both sides of the street, and broke into the front courtyard of the embassy, forcibly destroying and stealing six news picture windows set inside the front courtyard fence, and savagely beating the Chinese Embassy Chargé d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan, diplomatic personnel, and staff who went to reason with them. All 31 Chinese personnel present were beaten, three were seriously injured, including Second Secretary Wang Jinqing. The Chinese Embassy Chargé d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan was struck on the head. Commercial Counselor Cai Xinde was beaten to the ground and his chest was trampled. The "guardians of the embassy," more than ten Soviet police, did not stop the thugs' violence but instead helped them beat up the Chinese Embassy personnel. During the entire process of the thugs' violence, the Soviet authorities cut off the embassy's telephone connection with Beijing. The facts prove that this extremely serious incident was carefully planned and directly created by the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin.

It must be pointed out that great socialist China is an independent sovereign state. The diplomatic rights enjoyed by our embassy in the Soviet Union are sacred and inviolable. The news picture windows are set within the embassy premises. The Soviet plainclothes agents, carrying axes and other murderous weapons, broke into our embassy, recklessly carrying out destruction and violence, which is a blatant violation of China's sovereignty and a breach of the most basic diplomatic norms.

It must be pointed out that China's diplomatic personnel are representatives of the Chinese people. During the absence of the ambassador, the Chargé d'Affaires is the official representative of our government. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique organized thugs to beat up our diplomatic personnel, to beat up our official representative in the Soviet Union. This is a great insult to the People's Republic of China and the 700 million Chinese people, and the most serious crime of destroying Sino-Soviet relations.

It must be pointed out that after the February 3rd atrocity, the Soviet thugs, under the command of police cars, made four consecutive sneak attacks on our embassy on the 4th, attempting to destroy the evidence. Our embassy personnel, in order to defend their sovereignty, have been on guard day and night to protect their safety, without rest or sleep, completely disrupting the normal work and activities of our embassy personnel. This is unprecedented in the history of international relations and is absolutely intolerable.

It must be pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's blatant violation of the most basic norms of international relations is something that only Hitler's fascist Germany and the common enemy of the people, U.S. imperialism, could do.

The serious damage to Sino-Soviet relations is entirely the doing of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. Now, the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and people all over the world are closely watching the Soviet government to see how far they will go in destroying Sino-Soviet relations.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is a negative example for the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and revolutionary people all over the world. Their most barbaric fascist atrocities once again prove that they are complete traitors to the great Lenin and the great Soviet people.

The Chinese government strongly protests the new fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet government within the premises of the Chinese Embassy! The Soviet government must publicly admit its mistakes, apologize to all the victims of the Chinese Embassy, severely punish all the perpetrators, restore the six news picture windows of the Chinese Embassy, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Otherwise, the Soviet government will be fully responsible for all the serious consequences that arise. We warn the Soviet government that China's sovereignty is inviolable. The patience of the Chinese people has its limits. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not intimidated by the fascist hatchet. All reactionaries who oppose the Chinese people will meet a bad end.

### 我国最最强烈抗议苏修法西斯暴行

    苏修统治集团进一步卖身投靠美帝蓄意制造新的反华事件
    我国最最强烈抗议苏修法西斯暴行
    我国政府严正声明：苏修领导集团组织暴徒闯进中国大使馆，毒打中国外交代表和工作人员，是破坏最起码的外交关系准则和中苏两国关系的最严重的罪行。我们正告苏联政府，中国人民的克制是有限度的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是法西斯的斧头所吓不倒的。一切与中国人民为敌的反动派，都不会有好下场。
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国政府五日发表声明，声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                            一九六七年二月五日
    苏联政府继一月二十五日出动军警血腥镇压中国学生之后，又在二月三日指使暴徒闯进中国驻苏联大使馆，毒打中国外交代表和工作人员。这是苏联修正主义统治集团进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义蓄意制造的新的反华事件，是对社会主义中国和伟大的中国人民极端严重的挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并郑重提出最坚决、最强烈的抗议。
    二月三日上午，苏联外交部远东司司长苏达利柯夫约见中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远，无理要求立即拆除中国大使馆的新闻图片橱窗，并且蛮不讲理地声称，这个问题不容讨论，如果中国大使馆不拆除，苏联方面就要采取措施予以拆除。当天晚上莫斯科时间十八时五十分，苏联修正主义领导集团组织便衣特务一百六、七十人，突然乘车来到中国大使馆门前，封锁两侧街道，闯进大使馆前院，强行砸坏和抢走设在前院围栏以内的六个新闻图片橱窗，并野蛮殴打前往依理劝阻的中国大使馆临时代办安致远，外交人员和工作人员。在场的三十一名中国人员全部遭受毒打，三人伤势严重，其中包括二等秘书王荩卿。中国大使馆临时代办安致远头部被猛击。商务参赞蔡新德被打倒在地，胸部被踩伤。“守卫使馆”的十几名苏联警察，对于暴徒的行凶，非但不加制止，反而帮助他们殴打中国大使馆的人员。在整个暴徒行凶的过程中，苏联当局切断了大使馆同北京的电话联系。事实雄辩地证明，这次极为严重的事件，是以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏联修正主义领导集团精心策划直接制造的。
    必须指出，伟大的社会主义中国，是独立的主权国家。我国驻苏联使馆享有的外交权利，是神圣不可侵犯的。新闻图片橱窗，是设在使馆范围内。苏联便衣特务竟然携带斧头和其他杀人凶具，闯进我国使馆，肆无忌惮地进行破坏和行凶，这是公然侵犯中国的主权，破坏最起码的外交关系准则。
    必须指出，中国的外交人员是中国人民的代表。在大使离任期间，使馆的代办是我国政府的正式代表。苏联修正主义领导集团竟然组织暴徒毒打我国外交人员，毒打我国在苏联的正式代表。这是对中华人民共和国和七亿中国人民的莫大的侮辱，是破坏中苏两国关系的最严重的罪行。
    必须指出，在二月三日暴行之后，苏联暴徒又在警车的指挥下，四日连续四次偷袭我使馆，企图消灭罪证。我使馆人员为了保卫自己的主权，日以继夜地防卫自己的安全，得不到休息和睡眠，这就完全破坏了我使馆人员的正常工作和活动。这是国际关系史上罕见的，是绝对不能容忍的。
    必须指出，苏联修正主义领导集团这种公然破坏最起码的国际关系准则的暴行，只有希特勒法西斯德国和世界人民公敌美帝国主义才能干得出来。
    中苏两国关系遭到如此严重的破坏，完全是苏联修正主义领导集团一手造成的。现在，中国人民、苏联人民和全世界人民，都在密切地注视着苏联政府，究竟要把中苏两国关系破坏到什么地步。
    苏联修正主义领导集团，是中国人民、苏联人民和全世界革命人民一个反面教员。他们表演的最野蛮的法西斯暴行，又一次证明，他们是伟大列宁和伟大苏联人民的彻头彻尾的叛徒。
    中国政府对苏联政府在中国大使馆范围内犯下的新的法西斯暴行，提出最最强烈的抗议！苏联政府必须公开承认错误，向中国大使馆全体被害人员赔礼道歉，严惩全部肇事凶手，恢复中国大使馆的六个新闻图片橱窗，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。否则，由此引起的一切严重后果，苏联政府必须负完全责任。我们正告苏联政府，中国的主权是不容侵犯的。中国人民的克制是有限度的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是法西斯的斧头所吓不倒的。一切与中国人民为敌的反动派，都不会有好下场。
