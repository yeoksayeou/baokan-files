Friends from Burma and Cambodia strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist leadership's continuous anti-China atrocities and express active support for the struggle of the great Chinese people.

A Burmese friend, Deqin Du, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: The heads of the Soviet revisionist leadership have committed fascist crimes against Chinese students and diplomats to curry favor with U.S. imperialism, which is a blatant violation of international diplomatic norms.

He emphasized: "The Soviet revisionist traitors are unabashed betrayers of Marxism-Leninism, the greatest traitors to all revolutionary peoples, and especially the greatest traitors to the brave Vietnamese people who are on the frontline of resisting U.S. aggression."

He said: "The Soviet revisionists are now being exposed and opposed by all true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world."

He pointed out that the crimes committed against Chinese students and diplomats "are precisely the desperate struggles of the Soviet revisionist traitors under the irresistible influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, as they approach their final doom."

A Burmese friend, U Aung Zaya, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: The Soviet authorities' planned bloody suppression "exposed the true traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership, further inspiring all revolutionary peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world to resolutely carry on the struggle against their common enemy—the imperialists led by the United States, various modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Union, and all reactionaries—to the end."

He said, the Soviet revisionist leadership is shouting at the top of their lungs about taking "joint action." However, at the time when the United States is blatantly invading Vietnam, they reached many agreements with the United States. It is these Marxist-Leninist traitors who take joint action against the People's Republic of China, together with the imperialists and reactionaries to slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people, to slander the great Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong.

He pointed out, the great Chinese people are the steadfast standard-bearers of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the true supporters of all revolutionary peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world, and Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.

A Burmese student wrote in a letter to Chinese students: "Your struggle on January 25 in Moscow is a great contribution to the international student movement in your struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries. We firmly support your struggle."

The letter said, the atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Chinese students will prompt the Soviet people to grasp Mao Zedong Thought, rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership, and overthrow them.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody crime of beating Chinese students also aroused strong indignation among Cambodian friends. A Cambodian friend said, the Chinese students "defended Leninism, and I like to see those who defend Leninism the most." Another Cambodian student said: "The Soviet police are too bad, they actually snatched the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' from the hands of Chinese students and tried to trample it underfoot, which is unacceptable to us. Because Chairman Mao is the great leader of all the people of the world, the Lenin of our time."

    缅、柬朋友谴责苏修接连制造反华暴行
    苏修集团反华是垂死挣扎的表现
    新华社十一日讯　缅甸和柬埔寨的一些朋友强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团接连制造反华暴行，并且对伟大的中国人民的斗争表示积极支持。
    缅甸朋友德钦兑对新华社记者说：苏联修正主义领导集团的头目们为了讨好美帝国主义，对中国留学生和外交人员所犯下的法西斯罪行，是“对国际外交准则的肆无忌惮的破坏”。
    他强调指出：“苏修叛徒是马克思列宁主义的不折不扣的背叛者，是所有革命人民的最大的叛徒，特别是站在反击美国侵略者斗争前线的英勇的越南人民的最大的叛徒。”
    他说：“苏修现在正在遭到所有真正的马克思列宁主义者和亚非拉以及世界其他地区一切革命人民的揭露和反对。”
    他指出，对中国留学生和外交人员所犯下的罪行“正是苏修叛徒在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命的不可抵挡的影响下，日益临近最后灭亡的垂死挣扎。”
    缅甸朋友吴昂扎对新华社记者说：苏修当局预谋的血腥镇压行径“暴露了苏修领导集团真正的叛徒面目，进一步激励了亚非拉和世界其他地区的一切革命人民，越来越坚决地把反对他们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联领导为核心的形形色色的现代修正主义和一切反动派——的斗争进行到底。”
    他说，苏联修正主义领导集团声嘶力竭地叫嚷采取“联合行动”。但是，就在美国赤裸裸侵略越南的时候，他们同美国达成许多协议，正是这些马克思列宁主义的叛徒，采取联合行动反对中华人民共和国，同帝国主义者和反动派一起诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命，诬蔑伟大的中国人民和毛泽东主席。
    他指出，伟大的中国人民是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的坚定旗手，是亚非拉和世界其他各地的一切革命人民的真正支持者，毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    一位缅甸学生在写给中国留学生的一封信中说：“你们一月二十五日在莫斯科的斗争是你们在反对帝国主义，修正主义和一切反动派的斗争中，给国际学生运动作出的伟大贡献。我们坚决支持你们的这一斗争。”
    信件说，苏联修正主义领导集团对中国留学生犯下的暴行，将促使苏联人民掌握毛泽东思想，起来造苏联修正主义领导集团的反，把他们推翻。
    苏联修正主义领导集团毒打中国留学生的血腥罪行，也激起了柬埔寨朋友的强烈愤怒。一位柬埔寨朋友说，中国留学生“保卫了列宁主义，我最喜欢看到保卫列宁主义的人。”另一位柬埔寨学生说：“苏联警察太坏了，竟然把《毛主席语录》从中国留学生手中抢过去，想踩在脚下，这是我们不能容忍的。因为毛主席是全世界人民的伟大领袖，是当代的列宁。”
