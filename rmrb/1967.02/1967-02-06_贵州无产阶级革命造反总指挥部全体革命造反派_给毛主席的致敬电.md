The entire revolutionary rebel contingent of the Guizhou Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel Command sends a telegram of salutation to Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 2nd: The Guizhou Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel Command held a "Meeting to Pledge Loyalty to Our Most Beloved and Respected Great Leader Chairman Mao" on the evening of February 1st. At the meeting, a telegram of salutation to Chairman Mao was passed. The full text is as follows:

Most Beloved and Respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

We, the entire revolutionary rebel contingent of the Guizhou Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel Command, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary respects to you, the red sun in our hearts, the reddest of the red!

Today, we have seen the Xinhua News Agency's retransmission of the "Notice from the Guizhou Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel Command" and read the extremely important editorial "Thunder from the Southwest" published by the People's Daily in response. Our hearts are filled with immense excitement, and we draw boundless strength from it. Respected Chairman Mao, this is the greatest support, the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur from you, our venerable leader. We are determined to follow the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Respected Chairman Mao, we are infinitely excited to report to you: Under the radiant guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, the strength of the Guizhou proletarian revolutionary rebels is growing ever stronger, and the situation is getting better and better. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are becoming increasingly isolated, and their lines of defense have been shattered. The proletarian cultural revolution in Guizhou, like that in the rest of the country, is advancing with an irresistible momentum into a deeper and broader new stage. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, like all reactionaries, will not willingly accept their doom. They "will not lay down their butcher's knives, and they will not become Buddhas." They will continue to plot and scheme, shoot dark arrows, and play tricks, launching new counterattacks. As you have taught us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are utterly destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are exactly the same. We will definitely, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, follow your teachings, meet them head-on, not yield an inch, seize every inch of power, and rebel to the end until final victory!

"Grasp revolution, promote production" is the major policy put forward by you, our venerable leader. We resolutely respond to your great call, seize the revolution, and promote production. We will, with the courage and bravery of proletarian revolutionaries, throw ourselves into the proletarian cultural revolution. We will defend our production posts and overfulfill the state plan, determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production in 1967.

Respected Chairman Mao, you have taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Taking power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is only the first step of the long march. Consolidating power will require even greater sacrifices. "Modesty leads to progress, arrogance leads to retrogression." We will definitely follow your teachings, be humble and guard against arrogance, eliminate all selfish thoughts, smash the "self" and establish the "public," and act in the fundamental interests of the proletariat. We will carry out a thorough revolution in our souls. We will most resolutely respond to your great call for "frugality in revolution," not indulge in extravagance, not be wasteful, and ensure that every penny of the state's money is used where the revolution needs it most.

Respected Chairman Mao! Words cannot express our feelings today. We solemnly pledge to you, our venerable leader: We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will be loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to you, our venerable leader, forever.

Finally, we sincerely wish you, the reddest of the red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!

    贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部全体革命造反派
    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社贵阳二日电　贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部在一日晚上举行的“向我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席表决心大会”上，通过了给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们，贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部全体革命造反派，向您，我们心中最红最红最红的红太阳，致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    今天，我们看到了新华社转发的《贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部通告》，并读了《人民日报》为此发表的极其重要的社论《西南的春雷》。我们心情万分激动，给我们增加无穷无尽的力量。敬爱的毛主席，这是您老人家对贵州无产阶级革命造反派的最大的支持，最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。我们决心沿着以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
      敬爱的毛主席，我们无限兴奋地向您汇报：在以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉照耀下，目前，贵州无产阶级革命造反派的力量越来越壮大，形势越来越好，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，越来越孤立，他们的阵线已被打得落花流水。贵州省的无产阶级文化大革命同全国一样，正以排山倒海之势，向着更深入更广阔的新阶段发展。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，他们同一切反动派一样，决不会甘心自己的灭亡，他们“不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛”。他们还会继续耍阴谋，放暗箭，耍花招，进行新反扑。正如您所教导我们的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，也正是这样。我们一定以最大的革命热情，按照您老人家的教导，针锋相对，寸土不让，寸权必夺，一反到底，直到最后胜利！
    “抓革命，促生产”，是您老人家提出来的重大方针，我们坚决响应您的伟大号召，狠抓革命，大促生产，我们要以无产阶级革命家的魄力和勇气投身于无产阶级文化大革命。我们要坚守生产岗位，超额完成国家计划，誓夺一九六七年的革命、生产双胜利。
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中把权夺过来，这只是万里长征走完了第一步，巩固政权还要付出更大的代价。“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，我们一定遵循您老人家的教导，戒骄戒躁，排除一切私心杂念，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，一切从无产阶级的根本利益出发，在自己灵魂深处大闹革命。我们最坚决响应您提出的“节约闹革命”的伟大号召，不讲排场，不讲阔气，杜绝浪费，让国家的每一分钱都用到革命最需要的地方去。
    敬爱的毛主席！千言万语难以表达我们今天的心情。我们庄严地向您老人家宣誓：永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做一个永远忠于党，忠于人民，忠于您老人家的红色造反者。
      最后，我们衷心祝愿您老人家，我们心中最红最红最红的红太阳，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部
                      全体革命造反派
                          一九六七年二月一日
