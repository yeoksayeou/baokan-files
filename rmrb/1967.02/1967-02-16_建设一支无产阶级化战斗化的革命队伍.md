A heart-pounding struggle for power by revolutionary rebels is unfolding across our country. We rebels respond to Chairman Mao's great call, taking the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the fate of the socialist economy firmly into our own hands.

This situation is excellent!

However, seizing power is only the first step of a long march. We have many tasks ahead. We must not only dare to destroy the old world but also be skilled in building a new one. We must fight relentlessly against class enemies who refuse to die and plot to seize power back, and we must struggle against all kinds of rightist and conservative trends in society. We must firmly grasp the power we have seized and keep it forever in our hands!

The task is heavy, and the road is long.

To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must seriously study the brilliant work "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," written by our great leader Chairman Mao 37 years ago. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate various wrong tendencies in our ranks, purge all non-proletarian ideas from our minds, and build a proletarianized and combat-ready revolutionary force.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ranks of revolutionary rebels have grown and strengthened, achieving great success and gaining valuable experience. However, we must recognize that we do not live in a vacuum. The sharp and complex class struggle in society will inevitably reflect in our ranks. Many things contrary to Mao Zedong Thought will inevitably find their way into our ranks. If we do not remain vigilant and overcome these issues promptly, these bad elements will grow, causing great harm to our cause.

The revolutionary rebel force is the main force for completing the historical tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Therefore, we must thoroughly eliminate the "purely military viewpoint" and "purely professional viewpoint" in our ranks. We must always emphasize Mao Zedong Thought. The busier the work, the more we must read Chairman Mao's books. The more tasks there are, the more we must emphasize Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we grasp the overall direction of the movement and avoid taking the wrong path.

Emphasizing proletarian politics and opposing all non-proletarian thoughts is the essence of the brilliant work "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party." It is the fundamental guarantee for the rapid proletarianization of our army. Various non-proletarian thoughts exist to different degrees in revolutionary rebel organizations. If not corrected in time, they will eventually change the color of the revolutionary rebel organizations. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Only by firmly emphasizing proletarian politics, grasping living thoughts, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything can we turn the revolutionary rebel organizations into a revolutionary, scientific, and disciplined combat organization with proletarian characteristics.

We are revolutionary rebels. We rise in rebellion, fearing neither suppression nor attacks. We charge into battle and declare war on the old world. This is not just to liberate ourselves; we want to create a red China and liberate all the suffering class brothers around the world. For this, we must thoroughly eliminate all kinds of individualism from our minds and smash all kinds of factionalism and localism in our ranks. Otherwise, we cannot achieve the great unity of the revolutionary leftists, and even if united, it cannot be consolidated.

Some of our comrades, upon achieving some success, tend to be complacent and unwilling to move forward. They rest on their laurels and are unwilling to do painstaking work. They only care about personal interests and ignore the future of the country. This "half-revolutionary" thinking must be resolutely overcome. Only in this way can we establish the thought of carrying the revolution through to the end.

As the movement deepens, we must learn to do painstaking ideological work, learn to conduct in-depth investigations and class analysis. Only in this way can we always stand unshakable.

To adapt to the current class struggle situation and to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to live up to Chairman Mao's boundless expectations for us, we must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, build our revolutionary rebel force. This is the fundamental guarantee to strengthen our combat effectiveness and defeat all enemies.

    建设一支无产阶级化战斗化的革命队伍
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团“旭日”战斗队
    一场惊心动魄的革命造反派的夺权斗争正在我国全面展开。我们红色造反者响应毛主席的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把无产阶级专政的命运，把社会主义经济的命运紧紧掌握到自己的手里。
    这种形势好得很！
    但是，把大权夺回来，这只是万里长征走完了第一步，我们还有许许多多工作要做。我们不仅要敢于破坏一个旧世界，还要善于建设一个新世界。我们要和那些不甘心死亡，阴谋进行反夺权的阶级敌人作毫不留情的斗争，我们要和社会上形形色色的右倾保守思潮作不调和的斗争，我们要把夺来的权牢牢地掌握在自己手里，并且永远掌握在自己的手里！
    任重而道远。
    为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须认真学习我们伟大领袖毛主席在三十七年前写的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，用毛泽东思想来清除我们队伍中的种种错误倾向，肃清我们头脑中的形形色色的非无产阶级思想，建设一支无产阶级化、战斗化的革命队伍。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，革命造反派的队伍在不断地成长壮大，由小变大，由弱变强，获得了很大成绩，取得了许多宝贵的经验。但是我们应当看到，我们并不是生活在真空里，社会上尖锐复杂的阶级斗争必然要反映到我们的队伍里来，许多违反毛泽东思想的东西必然会带到我们的队伍里来，如果我们不及时警惕并加以克服，就会使那些坏东西滋长起来，给我们的事业带来极大的危害。
    我们革命造反派的队伍是完成一斗、二批、三改的历史任务的主力军，因此必须在我们的队伍中彻底肃清“单纯军事观点”、“单纯业务观点”，必须在我们的队伍中永远突出毛泽东思想。工作越忙，越要读毛主席的书，事情越多，越要突出毛泽东思想。只有这样，才能把握住运动的大方向，才能避免走到错误的道路上去。
    突出无产阶级政治、反对各种非无产阶级思想，这是《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作的灵魂，是促进我军迅速无产阶级化的根本保障。各种非无产阶级思想在红色造反团体中程度不同地存在着，如果不及时纠正，将来势必有一天会使红色造反团改变颜色。政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。只有坚决突出无产阶级政治，大抓活思想，用毛泽东思想来统帅一切，才能把红色造反团办成一个具有无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性的战斗的组织。
    我们是革命造反派，我们起来造反，不怕压制，不怕打击，冲锋陷阵，向旧世界宣战，这决不仅仅是为了解放自己，我们要造出一个红彤彤的新中国，我们还要解放全世界的受苦受难的阶级弟兄。为此，我们应当彻底肃清我们头脑中的形形色色的个人主义，应当打倒我们队伍中的各种小团体主义、山头主义。否则，就不能实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，联合了也不能巩固。
    我们有一些同志，在取得一定成绩的时候，容易沾沾自喜，不愿继续前进；他们躺倒在成绩上面，不肯再去做艰苦细致的工作；他们只顾个人的利益，而无视国家的前途。这种“半截革命”的思想，必须坚决克服。这样，才能树立将革命进行到底的思想。
    随着运动的深入发展，我们要学会做艰苦细致的思想工作，学会做深入的调查研究和阶级分析，只有这样，才能使我们永远立于不败之地。
    为了适应当前阶级斗争形势的需要，为了担负起无产阶级文化大革命的重担，不辜负毛主席对我们的无限希望，我们必须按照毛主席的教导，来建设我们红色造反者的队伍，这是增强我们的战斗力使之战胜一切敌人的根本保证。
