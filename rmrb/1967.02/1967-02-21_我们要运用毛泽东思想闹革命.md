We must use Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution.

The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has elevated the Marxism-Leninism of our era to its highest peak. Mao Zedong Thought is the radiant guide of our times, and it is becoming an invincible revolutionary force for change in great China and throughout the world.

Every step of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is uprooting the roots of modern revisionism. It has dashed the last hopes of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries who dream of restoring the old system that was thoroughly overthrown by the great people's revolution in China. Greek Marxist-Leninists rejoice at this.

Greek revolutionaries and all genuine revolutionaries around the world are exhilarated because the Chinese people have grasped Mao Zedong Thought and established in Beijing an impregnable fortress of world proletarian revolution.

Greek revolutionaries, tempered in the arduous struggle against American imperialist aggression and modern revisionism, will spare no effort and make any sacrifice to creatively apply Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary movement of the Greek people in their struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and socialism.

    我们要运用毛泽东思想闹革命
    光辉的毛泽东思想把我们时代的马克思列宁主义提高到最高峰。毛泽东思想是当代光辉的向导，它正在伟大的中国和全世界变成一股不可战胜的革命变革力量。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的每一个步骤，都在铲除现代修正主义的根子，使帝国主义、修正主义和反动派妄图复辟被中国伟大的人民革命彻底推翻了的旧制度的最后希望遭到破灭，希腊的马克思列宁主义者对此感到由衷的高兴。
    希腊革命者和全世界所有真正的革命者都感到欢欣鼓舞，因为中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，在北京建立起一座无产阶级世界革命的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    在反对美帝国主义侵略和反对现代修正主义的艰苦斗争中得到多方面锻炼的希腊革命者，将不遗余力、不惜牺牲地把毛泽东思想创造性地运用到希腊人民为争取民族独立、人民民主和社会主义的革命运动中去。
