Tanzanian Ambassador Paulo Eliel Mwaluko hosted a reception at the embassy to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the Tanzania-China Friendship Treaty.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and relevant officials, as well as representatives of revolutionary rebels, were invited to attend the reception.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, Tanzanian Ambassador to China Paulo Eliel Mwaluko held a reception at the embassy this evening to warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the Tanzania-China Friendship Treaty.

Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China-Africa Friendship Association, and other relevant departments, as well as representatives of revolutionary rebels, attended the reception upon invitation.

At the reception filled with warm and friendly atmosphere, Ambassador Paulo Eliel Mwaluko spoke first. He said that since the signing of the Tanzania-China Friendship Treaty, the friendly relations between the two countries have grown stronger year by year. China and Tanzania have always stood shoulder to shoulder in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

He said that the Tanzanian people cherish the remarkable achievements made by Chinese friends in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led personally by the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong. We wish the Chinese people further success until the final victory.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Pengfei spoke and said, "China and Tanzania are friendly countries. The peoples of the two countries face the common tasks of opposing imperialism, consolidating national independence, and building their own countries. In these aspects, we have carried out effective cooperation. Especially since the signing of the friendship treaty between the two countries two years ago, the friendly relations between the two countries have further developed comprehensively, setting a good example for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We believe that with our joint efforts, the friendly relations between the two countries will surely develop further, and the luster of our friendship treaty will shine even brighter."

He said that under the leadership of President Nyerere, Tanzania is taking more solid steps and achieving new victories in the path of safeguarding national independence and developing the national economy.

Qiao Pengfei said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The Chinese people regard the victories of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against imperialism as their own victories and give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles.' Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have been and will always be standing with the people of Tanzania and the peoples of Asia and Africa. We firmly believe that after the great proletarian cultural revolution, the Chinese people will make new and greater contributions to the cause of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world in their struggle for complete independence and liberation."

    据新华社二十日讯  坦桑尼亚驻中国大使保罗·埃利埃尔·姆瓦卢科今晚在大使馆举行招待会，热烈庆祝坦桑尼亚中国友好条约签订二周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅，外交部、中非友协和其他有关方面的负责人以及革命造反派代表，应邀出席了招待会。
    在充满热烈友好气氛的招待会上，保罗·埃利埃尔·姆瓦卢科大使首先讲话。他说，坦桑尼亚中国友好条约签订以来，我们两国间的友好关系一年比一年增强。中国和坦桑尼亚两国在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中，一直是并肩前进的。
    他说，坦桑尼亚人民珍视中国朋友在中国人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的显著的伟大成就。我们祝愿中国人民获得进一步的成功，直到最后胜利。
    外交部副部长姬鹏飞在讲话中说，中国和坦桑尼亚是友好国家。两国人民面临反对帝国主义、巩固民族独立和建设各自国家的共同任务。在这些方面，我们进行了卓有成效的合作。特别是自从两国友好条约签订两年以来，我们两国的友好关系又得到了进一步的、全面的发展，为亚非国家之间在和平共处五项原则之下和睦相处和友好合作树立了一个良好的典范。我们相信，在我们的共同努力下，我们两国的友好关系必将更加发展，我们的友好条约的光芒必将更加灿烂。
    他说，坦桑尼亚在尼雷尔总统领导下，正在维护民族独立、发展民族经济的道路上迈出更坚定的步伐，取得了新的胜利。
    姬鹏飞说，毛泽东主席教导我们说：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”遵照毛主席的教导，中国人民过去是，将来也永远是同坦桑尼亚人民和亚非人民站在一起的。我们坚信，中国人民经过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命之后，对全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取彻底独立解放的事业，必将作出新的更大的贡献。
