The Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a gathering to send off returning students and to protest Soviet revisionist atrocities. The Soviet revisionists are the sworn enemies of the revolutionary people and the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism. We strongly protest the Soviet authorities' blockade of Lenin's Mausoleum and their unreasonable obstruction of our students' attempt to lay wreaths.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Moscow on February 2, all staff members of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and several hundred Chinese students returning home via Moscow held a "Warmly Send Off Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Revisionist Fighters, Strongly Protest Soviet Revisionists' Refusal to Allow Our Students to Lay Wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb" meeting at the embassy on February 1.

Chinese Embassy Charge d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan first, on behalf of all embassy staff, warmly sent off the students who were injured in the bloody suppression by Soviet military police on the Red Square in Moscow on January 25, as well as Chinese students in France who were beaten by the police in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership.

An Zhi Yuan highly praised their proletarian revolutionary spirit. He said that the fact that the Soviet revisionist leadership once again unreasonably refused to allow Chinese students to lay wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb fully proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership is afraid of revolution, afraid of truth, afraid of the people, and afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

He continued: Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." He said, the Soviet revisionist leadership can deploy military police and secret agents to beat people, they can nail wooden walls onto Lenin's Mausoleum, but they cannot stop the spread of the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world—Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said, "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism, this is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the historical wheel, revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will certainly achieve victory."

Representative of the nine seriously injured anti-revisionist fighters, Ma Wenpu, said, "At the moment we are about to return to our beloved capital Beijing, we have a thousand words to say, but our first words are: We sincerely wish our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life, eternal life! We shout, long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" Ma Wenpu said: Through this struggle, we have further recognized the shameful face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and their fascist brutal rule, and we are more determined to be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought. We have a clearer understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When we return, we will definitely work harder to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, remember the blood debts owed by domestic and foreign class enemies, and resolutely defend the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. We will thoroughly criticize revisionism, thoroughly criticize imperialism, and thoroughly criticize all ghosts and monsters, and we will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Liang Hua Liang, a representative of Chinese students in France, denounced at the meeting the crime of the Soviet revisionists colluding with French imperialism to brutally suppress Chinese students in France who went to the Soviet Embassy to submit a protest letter.

He said: We are Chinese revolutionary youth armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, we are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, we have the great support of 700 million Chinese people, and we have the support of all revolutionary people in the world, we are not afraid of anything.

Liang Hua Liang strongly protested the Soviet authorities' refusal to allow them to lay wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb.

Chinese students studying in Cuba, Zhu Xinghe, also spoke at the meeting. Zhu Xinghe read out a protest statement issued by Chinese students passing through Moscow regarding the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's unreasonable refusal to allow Chinese students to lay wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb.

The protest statement said: After the Soviet revisionist scoundrels' fascist atrocity of bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe on January 25, they again arbitrarily prevented us from paying tribute to the great leader and teacher of the proletarian revolution, Lenin, and the great Marxist-Leninist, Stalin. They have completely betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, and betrayed the world revolution. They are the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism and the sworn enemies of the revolutionary people! At the same time, they also exposed their paper tiger's weak essence of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

The protest statement said: The great people of the Soviet Union with a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition will surely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionists and smash them to pieces. Lenin's hometown will shine again with the light of Marxism-Leninism, and the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high on the Red Square! The protest statement said, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Our blood will not be shed in vain, and blood debts will be repaid with blood. Revolutionary people will not forgive the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The heinous crimes committed by the Soviet revisionists against the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the revolutionary people of the world will surely be severely punished!

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Moscow on February 2, in the morning of February 1, Chinese Embassy Charge d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan met with the Director of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Sudalikov, to express that Chinese students returning home via Moscow from Europe and Latin American countries wanted to lay wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb, and hoped that the relevant Soviet authorities would provide assistance. Sudalikov initially said he would contact the relevant authorities and give a reply after one hour. However, 40 minutes later, Sudalikov called An Zhi Yuan to refuse the students' request on the pretext that the "Red Square is under repair." An Zhi Yuan requested to meet Sudalikov again over the phone, but Sudalikov refused the meeting and abruptly hung up the phone. The Chinese Embassy issued a protest statement to the Soviet Foreign Ministry, expressing strong protest.

The protest statement said, we ask the Soviet revisionist authorities, is it really because of the "repairs" that the wreaths cannot be laid? No, it is not, absolutely not! When you were brutally suppressing Chinese students in Europe on January 25, wasn't Lenin's Mausoleum intact? You hate and fear these few Chinese students passing through Moscow to return home, you escort them with a large number of police cars, you film and photograph their every move, you deploy a large number of police cars to patrol day and night around our embassy, and you even fear their laying wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb. You are so terrified, panicked, and unable to sleep at night, precisely because you are afraid that our students' revolutionary actions will arouse the Soviet people's remembrance of Lenin and Stalin, afraid of the strengthening of Sino-Soviet friendship, afraid of Marxism-Leninism, and afraid of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The protest statement said, our greatest leader Chairman Mao said, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." You are so afraid of our students, so hostile to our students, precisely because they are right and doing well! Your obstruction is in vain, the brilliant light of great Marxism-Leninism and great Mao Zedong Thought is something that no one can block.

    我驻苏使馆集会欢送归国留学生并抗议苏修暴行
    苏修是革命人民死敌美帝头号帮凶
    严重抗议苏修当局封锁列宁陵墓无理阻挠我留学生去献花圈
    据新华社莫斯科一日电　我国驻苏联大使馆全体工作人员和途经莫斯科回国的数百名我国留学生，一日晚上在大使馆举行了“热烈欢送反帝反修战士，严重抗议苏修拒绝我学生向列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈大会”。
    中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远首先代表全馆同志热烈欢送一月二十五日在莫斯科红场惨遭苏联军警血腥镇压而受伤的部分同学、以及在法国遭到苏修领导集团串通法国警察殴打的中国留法学生。
    安致远高度赞扬了他们的无产阶级造反精神。他说，苏修领导集团再次无理拒绝我国留学生向列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈的事实，充分证明了苏修领导集团害怕革命，害怕真理，害怕人民，害怕伟大的毛泽东思想。
    他接着说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”他说，苏修领导集团可以出动军警特务打人，可以把列宁陵墓钉上木墙，但是决不能阻挡当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想在全世界的传播。毛主席说过：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    九位受重伤的反修战士的代表马文普同学说：“在我们即将回到我们日夜盼望的祖国首都北京的时刻，我们有千言万语要说，我们的第一句话就是：最最衷心地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！我们高呼，毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”马文普说：经过这场斗争的锻炼，使我们进一步认识了苏修领导集团背叛马克思列宁主义的可耻面目和法西斯的残酷统治，更坚定了我们忠于伟大的毛泽东思想的决心，更清楚地认识到无产阶级文化大革命的重大意义。我们回去后，一定更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，牢记国内外阶级敌人欠下的笔笔血债，誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，大造特造修正主义的反，大造特造帝国主义的反，大造特造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    留法学生代表陈惠良在会上控诉了苏修与法帝国主义勾结一起，残暴镇压去苏联驻法大使馆递交抗议信的中国留法学生的罪行。
    他说：我们是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国革命青年，是毛主席的红小兵，我们有伟大的七亿中国人民作后盾，有全世界一切革命人民的支持，我们什么也不怕。
    陈惠良强烈抗议苏修当局不让他们去给列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈。
    我国留古巴的学生朱兴和也在会上讲了话。朱兴和在会上宣读了途经莫斯科的中国留学生就苏联修正主义统治集团无理拒绝中国学生向列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈一事发表的抗议声明。
    抗议声明说：苏修混蛋们继一月二十五日在红场血腥镇压中国留欧学生的法西斯暴行以后，又蛮横无理地不让我们悼念无产阶级革命的伟大领袖和导师列宁和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林。他们完全背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了世界革命。他们是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是革命人民的不共戴天的死敌！同时也恰好暴露了他们外强中干的纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    抗议声明说：具有光荣的革命斗争传统的伟大的苏联人民，必将起来造苏修的反，把它们砸个稀巴烂。伟大的列宁的故乡将重放马克思列宁主义的光芒，毛泽东思想的红旗必将在红场上高高飘扬！抗议声明说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不是好惹的。我们的血不会白流，血债要用血来还。革命人民是不会饶恕苏修统治集团的。苏修对中国人民，对苏联人民和对世界革命人民犯下的滔天罪行，终将得到严厉的惩罚！
    据新华社莫斯科一日电　一日上午，我国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远约见苏联外交部远东司司长苏达利柯夫，向他表示，路经莫斯科回国的中国留欧洲和拉丁美洲各国的学生要向列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈，希望苏联有关方面予以协助。苏达利柯夫当时表示，他愿同有关方面联系，一小时后再会见安致远，给予答复。可是，四十分钟后，苏达利柯夫用电话通知安致远，以“红场正在进行修理”为借口，拒绝了中国学生的这一正当要求。安致远在电话中要求再次会见苏达利柯夫，而苏达利柯夫竟拒绝会见，并不等通话完毕就悍然挂断电话。中国大使馆就此发表抗议声明，向苏联外交部提出严重抗议。
    抗议声明说，我们要质问苏修当局，难道真的是因为“修理”而不能献花圈吗？不，不是，绝对不是！你们一月二十五日在红场血腥镇压中国留欧学生的时候，列宁陵墓不是好好的吗？你们对这些为数不多的路过莫斯科回国的中国学生恨之入骨、怕得要命。你们在用大批警车“护送”他们，你们对他们的一举一动都大拍电影和照片，你们在中国大使馆周围布下大批警车昼夜巡逻，你们甚至对他们向列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈也都怕得发抖。你们如此心惊肉跳，惶惶不可终日，就是因为你们害怕我们学生的革命行动会引起苏联人民对列宁斯大林的怀念，害怕中苏人民友谊的加强，害怕马克思列宁主义，害怕伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    抗议声明说，我们最伟大的领袖毛主席说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。你们这样害怕我们的学生，这样仇视我们的学生，正说明他们做得对，干得好！你们的一切阻挠都是徒劳的，伟大的马克思列宁主义、伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉是任何人也遮挡不住的。
