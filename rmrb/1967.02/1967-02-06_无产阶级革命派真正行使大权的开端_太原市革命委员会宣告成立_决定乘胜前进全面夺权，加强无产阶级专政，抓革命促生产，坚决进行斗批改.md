The new power organ of the revolutionary people of Taiyuan, who have reclaimed the official seal and become the masters, was born amidst the triumphant songs of the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary forces. The Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters formally granted this organ the authority to handle all political, economic, and cultural affairs in Taiyuan City.

This marks the beginning of the proletarian revolutionary forces in Taiyuan truly exercising their great power, a necessary product of the development of the Cultural Revolution to a new stage, and another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

After the proletarian revolutionary forces united and seized power from the capitalist roaders in power, how to exercise their power, establish a new order for the proletariat, consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and repel the new counterattacks of the class enemies? This is a crucial question facing the proletarian revolutionary rebels. United under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary rebels in Taiyuan have displayed proletarian democracy and proletarian pioneering spirit, establishing a red power organ composed of revolutionary workers, peasants, students, leading cadres, and cadres—the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee. On January 28, they held an inaugural meeting and issued the "Announcement on the Establishment of the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee and Several Resolutions."

The full text of the "Announcement on the Establishment of the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee and Several Resolutions" is as follows:

In the great triumph of the alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary rebels, a brand-new red power organ—the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee—was born on January 28. This is a great historical achievement by the revolutionary rebels of Taiyuan, a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee has committed heinous crimes, and the proletarian revolutionary rebels took decisive action. On January 12, they overthrew the provincial and municipal power organs controlled by these elements and smashed them to pieces!

The broad revolutionary rebels have seized power, taken the seal, and truly become the masters. Under the personal care and support of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, with the support of the People's Liberation Army Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, after fierce struggles, the proletarian revolutionary rebels have achieved decisive victories. The broad revolutionary masses are jubilant and proud, and the situation is excellent! The broad revolutionary rebels of Taiyuan deeply understand the great responsibility and arduous tasks ahead. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" We resolutely established our brand-new power organ—the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee—on the ruins of the counter-revolutionary revisionist ruling machine.

The Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee is composed of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary leading cadres. In the future, elections will be held according to the principles of the Paris Commune.

The Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee is now responsible for exercising all major powers in Taiyuan, including party, government, finance, and culture.

All decisions of the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee will be guided by Mao Zedong Thought and will accept the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses. Decisions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought should be firmly implemented by the revolutionary masses; decisions that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought should be firmly resisted, and the masses should rise up against them.

At its first meeting, the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee discussed several major issues regarding the Cultural Revolution in Taiyuan under the current excellent situation and adopted the following resolutions:

(1) To advance victoriously and seize power comprehensively. The fundamental issue of the proletarian Cultural Revolution is the seizure of power. The proletarian revolutionary rebels in Taiyuan believe that we cannot be satisfied with the victories already achieved; we must carry out a comprehensive and in-depth struggle for power. We must seize power from the capitalist roaders and from those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. To this end, we solemnly declare: The proletarian revolutionary rebels on all fronts should unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, seizing all powers in industry, agriculture, finance, commerce, judiciary, and education, truly putting them in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary rebels. We must firmly and unshakably seize power for the Party, for the proletariat, and for communism. The proletarian revolutionary rebels must dare to seize power, be good at seizing power, dare to exercise power, and be good at exercising power. After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels in each unit must immediately establish new revolutionary power organs. At the same time, during the struggle for power, we must be good at class analysis and grasp Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. The proletarian revolutionary rebels must unite with those leading cadres who stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and fight together.

(2) To strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, allowing only the left to rebel and not allowing the right to revolt. To this end, we solemnly declare: Those who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-party elements," "rightists," "extortionists," and "ambition-seekers" during the Cultural Revolution must be thoroughly and completely exonerated, and their reputations must be restored publicly. All counter-revolutionary organizations and elements must be firmly suppressed, allowing them to behave only honestly and not to cause trouble.

(3) "Grasp the revolution and promote production." "Grasp the revolution and promote production" is the great order given to us by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. To this end, we solemnly declare: All proletarian revolutionary rebels should become models of "grasping the revolution and promoting production." The revolutionary masses in all municipal organs, factories, mines, people's communes, and enterprises should actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, ensuring the completion of production, construction, and work tasks.

(4) To resolutely carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. To achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. To this end, we solemnly declare: The handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party and the few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line must be fully exposed and thoroughly criticized, and they must be overthrown, smashed, and discredited. All reactionary academic "authorities," bourgeois ideology, and the ideology of all exploiting classes must be thoroughly criticized, and the influence of bourgeois and revisionist elements must be thoroughly eliminated. At the same time, we must reform education, reform literature and art, and reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, thoroughly completing the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

For a long time, Taiyuan has been occupied by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They colluded with each other, formed cliques, and practiced bourgeois dictatorship. Such a bourgeois dictatorship state machine must be thoroughly smashed, firmly rebelled against, and completely overturned. All revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses must take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, implement proletarian political leadership, and strive to create new organizational forms for the proletarian dictatorship state organs. We firmly believe that in the near future, based on the great enrichment and development of the Paris Commune experience, a brand-new political organizational form—Taiyuan Commune—that is more suitable for the socialist economic base will appear before us.

    无产阶级革命派真正行使大权的开端
    太原市革命委员会宣告成立
    决定乘胜前进全面夺权，加强无产阶级专政，抓革命促生产，坚决进行斗批改
    新华社太原四日电　重新掌了大印，作了主人的太原市革命人民的新的权力机构——太原市革命委员会，在无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权的凯歌声中诞生了。山西省革命造反总指挥部正式授予这个机构处理太原市政治、经济、文化的一切大权。
    这是太原市无产阶级革命派真正行使自己大权的新的开端，是无产阶级文化大革命发展到一个新阶段的必然产物，是毛泽东思想的又一新的胜利。
    无产阶级革命派大联合，夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权之后，如何行使自己的权力，建立无产阶级的新秩序，巩固无产阶级政权，击退阶级敌人的新反扑？这是摆在无产阶级革命造反派面前的一个关键问题。太原市无产阶级革命造反派团结在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，发扬无产阶级大民主，发扬无产阶级首创精神，成立了由革命工人、革命农民、革命学生、革命领导干部和革命干部组成的红色权力机构——太原市革命委员会，并于一月二十八日举行了成立大会，发布了《太原市革命委员会宣告成立和几项决议的通告》。
    《太原市革命委员会宣告成立和几项决议的通告》，全文如下：
    在伟大的无产阶级革命造反派的大联合、大夺权的胜利高潮中，一个崭新的红色权力机构——太原市革命委员会在一月二十八日诞生了。这是我们太原市革命造反派一项具有历史意义的伟大创举，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    山西省委和太原市委内的反革命修正主义集团，罪行滔天，恶贯满盈，无产阶级革命造反派采取了大联合的行动，于一月十二日把他们把持的省、市权力机构推翻了，砸烂了！
    广大的革命造反派夺了权，掌了印，真正当家作主了。在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和支持下，在人民解放军山西省军区和驻晋部队的支援下，经过剧烈的搏斗，无产阶级革命造反派取得了决定性的胜利，广大革命群众为之欢欣鼓舞，扬眉吐气，真是一派大好形势！太原市广大的革命造反派，深知自己责任的重大，任务的艰巨，我们牢记着毛主席的教导：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”我们毅然决然地在打碎反革命修正主义统治机器的废墟上，建立了我们无产阶级革命造反派的崭新的权力机构——太原市革命委员会。
    太原市革命委员会由工人、农民、革命学生、革命干部和革命的领导干部组成。将来按照巴黎公社的原则，举行全面的选举。
    太原市革命委员会，现在负责行使太原市党、政、财、文等各种大权。
    太原市革命委员会的一切决定，以毛泽东思想为指针，接受广大革命群众的监督。凡是符合毛泽东思想的决定，革命群众都应坚决贯彻执行；凡不符毛泽东思想的决定，革命群众都应坚决抵制，起来造它的反。
    太原市革命委员会，第一次会议讨论了在当前大好形势下我市无产阶级文化大革命的若干重大问题，并通过了下列决议：
    （一）乘胜前进，全面夺权。无产阶级文化大革命的根本问题，就是夺权问题。太原市无产阶级革命造反派认为，不能满足于已经取得的胜利，还要全面深入地开展夺权斗争。夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，夺坚持资产阶级反动路线顽固分子的权。为此，我们庄严宣告：各个战线的无产阶级革命造反派，在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来，把工交、农业、财贸、政法、文教等一切大权统统夺过来，真正掌握在无产阶级革命造反派手里。要坚定不移地为党夺权，为无产阶级夺权，为共产主义夺权。无产阶级革命造反派要敢于夺权，善于夺权，敢于掌权，善于掌权。各单位的革命造反派都要在夺权之后，立即建立起新的革命的权力机构。同时，在夺权斗争中，要善于做阶级分析，善于掌握毛主席的策略思想。无产阶级革命造反派要和那些站在毛主席革命路线一边的领导干部结合起来，共同战斗。
    （二）加强无产阶级专政，只许左派造反，不许右派翻天。为此，我们庄严宣告：对在文化大革命中被打成“反革命分子”、“反党分子”、“右派分子”、“伸手派”、“野心家”等的革命同志，必须认真、彻底地进行平反，当众恢复名誉。对于一切反革命组织和反革命分子，必须坚决镇压，只许他们老老实实，不许乱说乱动。
    （三）“抓革命，促生产”。“抓革命，促生产”，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席给我们下达的伟大动员令。为此，我们庄严宣告：一切无产阶级革命造反派都应该成为“抓革命，促生产”的模范。全市的机关、厂矿、人民公社和企业事业单位的革命群众都应该积极参加文化大革命运动，保证完成生产建设和工作任务。
    （四）坚决进行斗批改，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。要使无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利，必须坚决彻底地进行斗批改。为此，我们庄严宣告：对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，必须充分揭露，彻底批判，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。对于反动学术“权威”、资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，都必须彻底批判，彻底肃清资产阶级、修正主义的影响。同时要改革教育、改革文艺、改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，彻底完成斗批改的伟大历史任务。
    长期以来，太原市被一小撮反革命修正主义分子所盘踞。他们上下勾结，结党营私，实行资产阶级专政。对于这样的资产阶级专政的国家机器，必须彻底打碎，坚决造反，一反到底。一切革命造反派，一切革命群众，都要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为行动指南，实行无产阶级政治挂帅，努力创造无产阶级专政国家机构的新的组织形式。我们坚信：不久的将来，在大大地丰富和发展巴黎公社经验的基础上，一个更适合于社会主义经济基础的崭新的政权组织形式——太原公社，将会出现在我们面前。
              太原市革命委员会
              一九六七年一月二十八日
