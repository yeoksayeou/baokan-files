Today, as we warmly welcome the glorious anti-revisionist fighters returning victorious, the revolutionary rebels and people from all walks of life in the capital once again issued a stern warning to the Soviet revisionist ruling clique: Listen, you Soviet revisionist bastards, the Chinese people are not to be trifled with! You few buzzing flies challenging the Chinese people will not end well! The blood debt you owe will definitely be repaid! The Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world will not forgive you, this bunch of new tsars of the Kremlin.

Our heroic anti-revisionist fighters—Chinese students returning from Europe who went through Soviet revisionist thugs' bloody suppression and broke through their numerous obstacles—have returned to our great motherland's capital, Beijing, and to the side of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Over ten million revolutionary rebels and people from all walks of life in the capital lined the streets of Beijing Station and the nearby avenues to give them the warmest welcome upon their triumphant return, saluting them with proletarian cultural revolutionary combat greetings.

"Glorious anti-revisionist fighters, you have rebelled against a small clique of Soviet revisionist bastards, and you have done well! You have done brilliantly! We applaud you a thousand times, and we welcome you a million times!" Today, tens of thousands of revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers, revolutionary commune members from the suburbs, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary soldiers from the capital, holding countless red flags and waving the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," formed team after team, surging forward in a mighty stream to welcome their comrades and strongly protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists against our students. In the surging crowd of welcomers, people waved their revolutionary rebel fists thousands of times and shouted, "Unite the people of China and the Soviet Union, overthrow the modern revisionist ruling clique of the Soviet Union! Hang Brezhnev! Hang Kosygin!" People also read aloud repeatedly the quotations from Chairman Mao that our students read at Lenin's Tomb: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of man's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to hold back the wheel of history, revolution is inevitable and will ultimately triumph." Everyone said: We will read Chairman Mao's wise words a thousand times, ten thousand times, forever, until the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is completely overthrown! Until the entire capitalist system is completely overthrown!

"We strongly protest the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities against Chinese students! All proletarians of the world, unite! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! We will definitely fight alongside the revolutionary masses of China!" Foreign experts and students who have been protesting and demonstrating in front of the Soviet Embassy with the revolutionary masses of the capital for days also came to Beijing Station to welcome the Chinese anti-revisionist comrades. Over two hundred foreign comrades from thirty-five countries and regions held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners written in English, French, Japanese, Arabic, Spanish, Indonesian, and other languages, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting slogans, enthusiastically praising the heroic struggle of Chinese students armed with Mao Zedong Thought against Soviet modern revisionists. They said, the revolutionary spirit of Chinese students has set a brilliant example for revolutionary youth around the world.

Around 2 PM, the train carrying our students slowly pulled into Beijing Station. Amidst the interwoven sounds of drums and cheers, the students, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and waving red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with tears of excitement, shouted, "Long live our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!" as they stepped off the train. At this moment, people on the platform waved red flags and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting: "Firmly support the revolutionary actions of our students! Salute to our revolutionary students! Rebellion is justified! Down with the U.S. imperialists! Down with the Soviet revisionists! Down with the bastards Brezhnev and Kosygin! Smash the heads of the Soviet revisionist dogs!" The slogans thundered like spring thunder, shaking the heavens.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, along with representatives of the revolutionary masses, walked up to the train cars one by one, warmly shaking hands with the students, expressing their warm regards and praising their revolutionary rebel spirit as excellent, excellent!

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the station. The band played "The East Is Red." The welcoming crowd and the anti-revisionist fighters, each holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," read aloud the teachings of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people. 'The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.' All the reactionaries are merely paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the whole world, be brave, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be routed."

Following this, a representative of the capital's revolutionary rebels spoke, enthusiastically praising the heroic anti-revisionist fighters who, in the white terror of Moscow, fought unyieldingly against the Soviet fascist thugs. He said, you fearlessly stood up, defended the dignity of our great motherland, protected our proletarian cultural revolution, and defended the great Mao Zedong Thought. You are truly the good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation in the Mao Zedong era. You did the right thing, and you did it well!

The representative of the capital's revolutionary rebels said, our most, most beloved leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese idiom used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people." Now, the sparks of revolutionary rebellion have already been ignited in the homeland of Lenin and Stalin. The great Soviet people will surely grasp the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionists, seize power from the Soviet revisionists, and hang the traitor clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin on the gallows. The great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high over the Kremlin.

Amidst thunderous applause, the anti-revisionist fighter representative Lu Zili stepped onto the stage to angrily denounce and strongly condemn the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist bastards. He said excitedly, we have returned to our beloved motherland, to the side of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, whom we have missed day and night. We will shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live our greatest teacher, greatest leader, greatest commander, and greatest helmsman Chairman Mao, long live, long live, ten thousand long lives!

Lu Zili said, imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries hate and fear our cultural revolution to death! We strike at a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, and it hurts the hearts of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. The bloody incident on Red Square on January 25 is a mad class revenge by the international class enemy against the Chinese revolutionary rebels. He said, the bloody incident on Red Square gave us an extremely profound class struggle lesson. He expressed that after returning to the country, he would start learning from scratch, using Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, taking "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon, forever standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, thoroughly rebelling against a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly rebelling against a small number of diehards who stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly rebelling against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, smashing them to smithereens, knocking them down to the ground, and stomping on them with our feet, making them never rise again! Never rise again! Definitely, in the great waves of the cultural revolution, we will temper ourselves into eternal red rebels loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao!

At the welcoming ceremony, many foreign friends handed over letters of condolence to the glorious anti-revisionist fighters. The foreign friends said, Mao Zedong Thought has shown the revolutionary people the direction of struggle, giving them courage, strength, and wisdom. Chinese students in Europe are so brave in fighting against the armed police of the Soviet revisionists because they have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

At the welcoming ceremony, the young rebels of the capital's revolutionary rebels presented Chairman Mao badges and "Anti-Revisionist Red Guards" armbands to the victorious returning anti-revisionist fighters.

As the welcoming ceremony ended, the entire audience sang "The Internationale." Subsequently, the revolutionary rebels and people of the capital, along with foreign friends, began a massive demonstration to denounce the crimes of the Soviet revisionists.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the evening of January 31, sixty Chinese students who were brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist leadership in front of Lenin's Mausoleum returned by train to Erlian, a border city of our great socialist motherland. Over two thousand revolutionary workers, revolutionary rebels, border guards, revolutionary masses, and Red Guards from various ethnic groups in Erlian gave the most enthusiastic welcome to the glorious anti-revisionist fighters who returned victorious and expressed the strongest protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet leadership in suppressing our students in Europe.

    光荣的反修战士胜利回到最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边
    首都革命造反派战士和各界革命群众十多万人集会热烈欢迎战友们归来
    陈毅副总理和革命群众代表亲切慰问我留欧学生，赞扬他们的革命造反精神
    据新华社一日讯　今天，在热烈欢迎光荣的反修战士胜利归来的时候，首都革命造反派战士和各界革命群众，又一次向苏修统治集团发出了严正的警告：苏修混蛋们听着，中国人民不是好惹的！你们几个嗡嗡叫的臭苍蝇向中国人民挑衅，决不会有好下场！你们欠下的血债一定要偿还！中国人民、苏联人民和世界人民决不会饶恕你们这帮克里姆林宫的新沙皇。
    我们英勇的反修战士——经过苏联回国的我国留欧学生，战胜了苏修暴徒的血腥镇压，冲破了他们设下的重重障碍，今天回到了我们伟大祖国的首都——北京，回到了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的身边。首都革命造反派和各界革命群众十多万人，在北京车站和车站附近的大道上，最热烈地夹道欢迎他们凯旋归来，向他们致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼。
    “光荣的反修战士们，你们造了一小撮苏修混蛋的反，你们干得好！干得漂亮！我们一千个欢呼，一万个欢迎！”今天，成千上万的首都革命造反派和革命的工人、革命的郊区人民公社社员、革命的学生、革命的知识分子以及革命的军人，高举着无数面红旗，挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，结成一支支队伍，浩浩荡荡，涌上街头，前来迎接自己的战友，强烈抗议苏修镇压我国留学生的法西斯暴行。在洪流般的欢迎队伍中，人们千百次地挥动革命造反的铁拳，不断高呼：“中苏两国人民团结起来，打倒苏联现代修正主义统治集团！”“绞死勃列日涅夫！”“绞死柯西金！”人们还一遍又一遍地朗读我国留学生在列宁墓前朗读的毛主席语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”大家说：我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断，我们要一千遍地朗读，一万遍地朗读，永远朗读，直到苏修统治集团彻底完蛋！直到整个资本主义制度彻底完蛋！
      “我们最最强烈抗议苏修镇压中国留学生的法西斯暴行！”“全世界无产阶级联合起来！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“我们坚决和中国革命群众战斗在一起！”连日来和首都革命群众一起到苏联大使馆门前抗议示威的外国专家和留学生们，今天也来到北京车站欢迎中国反修战友们。来自三十五个国家和地区的二百多位外国战友，高举着毛主席像和用英文、法文、日文、阿拉伯文、西班牙文、印度尼西亚文等各种文字写的标语，挥动着《毛主席语录》，高呼口号，热烈赞扬毛泽东思想武装起来的中国留学生同苏联现代修正主义者进行的英勇斗争。他们说，中国留学生的革命精神，为世界革命青年树立了光辉的榜样。
    下午二时许，我国留学生乘坐的列车徐徐驶进北京站。在交织成一片的锣鼓声和欢呼声中，留学生们高举着毛主席像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，含着激动的泪花，高呼着“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁”的口号走下列车。这时，人们在月台上挥动着红旗和《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“坚决支持我国留学生的革命行动！”“向我革命的留学生致敬！”“革命无罪，造反有理！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“打倒混蛋勃列日涅夫！”“打倒混蛋柯西金！”“砸烂苏修的狗头！”口号声如春雷震荡，响彻云霄。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志和革命群众的代表，一齐走到车厢前，同留学生们一一热烈握手，表示亲切慰问，赞扬他们的革命造反精神好得很，好得很！
    车站上举行了隆重的欢迎大会。乐队高奏《东方红》。欢迎的人们和反修战士们，人人手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    接着，首都革命造反派代表讲话，热烈赞扬英勇的反修战士们在白色恐怖的莫斯科，和苏修法西斯暴徒作了不屈不挠的斗争。他说，你们临危不惧，维护了我们伟大祖国的尊严，保卫了我国无产阶级文化大革命，捍卫了伟大的毛泽东思想，你们不愧为毛泽东时代的中华民族的好儿女。你们做得对，做得好！
    首都革命造反派代表说，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”现在，革命造反的星星之火，已经在列宁和斯大林的故乡点燃起来了。伟大的苏联人民必定要掌握光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，起来造苏修的反，夺苏修的权，把勃列日涅夫和柯西金这帮叛徒集团拉上绞刑架。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，必将高高飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空。
    在暴风雨般的热烈掌声中，反修战士代表卢自立走上讲台愤怒控诉和强烈谴责苏修混蛋的法西斯暴行。他激动地说，我们回到了亲爱的祖国，回到了日夜想念的我们心中最红最红最红的红太阳毛主席身边。我们要一千次一万次的高呼：我们最最伟大的导师、最最伟大的领袖、最最伟大的统帅、最最伟大的舵手毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
    卢自立说，帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派对我们的文化大革命恨得要死，怕得要命！我们打在一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的身上，疼在美帝、苏修和各国反动派的心上。一月二十五日的红场流血事件就是国际阶级敌人对中国革命造反派的一次疯狂的阶级报复。他说，红场的流血事件给我们上了一堂极其深刻的阶级斗争课。他表示回国以后要从头学起，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，以“老三篇”为武器，永远永远站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚定地站在无产阶级革命造反派方面，大造特造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造特造极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线人的反，大造特造帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的反，把他们统统砸个稀巴烂，把他们统统打倒在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身！永世不得翻身！一定要在文化大革命的大风大浪中把我们锻炼成为永远忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级红色造反者！
    在欢迎大会上，许多外国朋友把一封封慰问信交给光荣的反修战士。外国朋友们说，毛泽东思想给革命人民指明了斗争方向，给了革命人民勇气、力量和智慧。中国留欧学生所以如此勇敢地与苏修武装军警斗争，是由于他们用毛泽东思想武装了自己。
    在欢迎大会上，首都革命造反派的小将们，把毛主席像章和“反修红卫兵”袖章，赠给胜利归来的反修战士们。
    欢迎大会结束时，全场高唱《国际歌》。随后，首都革命造反派和革命群众以及外国朋友们，开始了声讨苏修罪行的声势浩大的示威游行。
    据新华社二连一日电　在列宁陵墓前惨遭苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压的我国留欧学生六十人，一月三十一日晚乘火车回到伟大社会主义祖国的边城二连浩特市。二连各民族革命工人、革命造反派、边防战士、革命群众和红卫兵两千多人向胜利归来的光荣的反修战士表示最热烈欢迎，并向苏修领导集团血腥镇压我留欧学生的法西斯暴行表示最最强烈的抗议。
