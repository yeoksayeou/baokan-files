The Seventh Company of a certain unit of the Longchuan Garrison firmly responds to Chairman Mao's call, resolutely supporting the revolutionary faction in their struggle for power. Officers and soldiers rushed to the scene at a critical moment, swiftly smashing a reactionary organization, greatly crushing the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries, and greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses.

	New China News Agency, Changchun, February 6 — The Seventh Company of a certain unit of the Longchuan Garrison firmly responds to Chairman Mao's great call, supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction with practical actions. They smashed a reactionary organization manipulated by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and powerfully supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction's struggle for power.

	On January 24, when Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses was transmitted to the Seventh Company, the officers and soldiers immediately began studying it and held lively discussions. Everyone resolutely declared that they would wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly support the proletarian revolutionary faction. Just at this moment, they suddenly received orders from higher-ups to immediately take action and support the proletarian revolutionary faction in the Longchuan area. The entire company was inspired, immediately fully armed, and rushed to the scene.

	At this time, the revolutionary masses in the Longchuan area had already surrounded a reactionary organization holed up in the Jilin Provincial Sports School. This reactionary organization was manipulated by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Jilin Provincial People's Committee. Since the Cultural Revolution, they had been carrying out frenzied counter-revolutionary activities: opposing the directives of the Central Committee, stubbornly defending the capitalist-roaders within the Provincial People's Committee who had been exposed, committing atrocities everywhere, beating revolutionary masses, and causing multiple bloody incidents. These criminals had committed heinous crimes against the proletarian Cultural Revolution. When the revolutionary masses surrounded them in a three-story building, they closed all doors and windows, attempting to make a last stand, and threw bricks and spears from the upper floors, injuring several Red Guards, police officers, and revolutionary masses. Just at this critical moment, the officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, marched to the scene with great vigor. The revolutionary masses immediately cheered, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Welcome, PLA supporting us!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" After the troops arrived, they immediately set up a perimeter and surrounded the building. They studied Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary masses, greatly boosting their fighting spirit. Then, they launched a political offensive against the reactionary organization, propagandizing the party's policies, and quickly awakened those who had been deceived. The small clique of reactionary leaders was completely isolated and had to surrender. Finally, the public security organs arrested them. After the arrest, they searched and found hidden handguns, grenades, swords, and other weapons. This action greatly crushed the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses. Everyone enthusiastically said: This is Chairman Mao's great concern and support for us, and it is Chairman Mao's wise leadership. This victory is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Through this action of supporting the revolutionary masses, the officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company deeply felt that the army's practical support for the proletarian revolutionary faction would more quickly promote the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction, ensure the victory of the proletarian revolutionary faction's struggle for power, and make the dictatorship of the proletariat more solid. Deputy Political Instructor Liu Tili said: "The People's Liberation Army supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction is Chairman Mao's greatest trust in us, and it is the ardent expectation of the broad leftist masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: The Red Army is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks. In the past, we and the broad masses closely united, defeated the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, and established the people's regime; today, we must stand most resolutely on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, firmly unite and fight with the broad leftist masses, and achieve victory together." All the comrades in the company unanimously declared: In the future, whenever the proletarian revolutionary faction needs our support, we will swiftly, resolutely, and unconditionally go to support them. We will defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death and carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    长春驻军某部七连坚决响应毛主席号召
    毫不含糊地支援革命派夺权斗争
    干部战士在紧要时刻奔赴现场，一举粉碎一个反动组织，大灭了反革命的威风，大长了革命群众的志气。
    新华社长春六日电　人民解放军长春驻军某部七连坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，以实际行动支援无产阶级革命派，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所操纵的反动组织，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，有力地支援了无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。
    一月二十四日，毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，一传到七连，干部战士就展开学习，讨论会开得十分热烈。大家坚决表示，要满腔热情地、毫不含糊地支持无产阶级革命派。正在这时，突然接到上级命令，要他们立即行动，去支持长春地区无产阶级革命派。全连群情振奋，立即全副武装，奔赴现场。
    这时，长春地区的革命群众，已经对盘踞在吉林省体育学校的反动组织实行了包围。这个反动组织，为吉林省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所操纵。文化大革命以来，他们疯狂地进行反革命活动：对抗党中央指示，死保省人委被揪出的走资本主义道路当权派，到处行凶，殴打革命群众，多次造成流血事件。这些坏蛋对无产阶级文化大革命犯下了滔天罪行。当革命群众把他们团团围困在一所三层楼房内时，他们四门紧闭，妄图负隅顽抗，并从楼上往下扔砖头，投标枪，打伤红卫兵、公安人员和革命群众数人。正当这个紧要时刻，七连指战员高唱毛主席语录歌，雄赳赳气昂昂地开到了现场。革命群众立即欢腾起来，齐声欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“欢迎解放军支持我们！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”部队开到之后，立刻布下警戒，包围了这座楼房。他们和革命群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，大大鼓舞了革命群众的斗志。接着，他们又对反动组织展开政治攻势，宣传党的政策，使受蒙蔽的人很快觉醒过来。一小撮反动头目完全陷于孤立，不得不乖乖地举手投降。最后，公安机关依法逮捕了他们。逮捕后，搜查出私藏的手枪、手榴弹、战刀等武器。这个行动，大大灭了反革命的威风，大大长了革命群众的志气，人人拍手称快。大家激动地说：这是毛主席对我们的巨大关怀和支持，是毛主席领导的英明。这个胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    通过这次支援革命群众的行动，七连的干部战士深深地体会到，我军用实际行动支援无产阶级革命派，就会更加迅速地促进无产阶级革命派大联合，保证无产阶级革命派夺权斗争胜利进行，使无产阶级专政更加巩固。副指导员刘体禄说：“人民解放军支持无产阶级革命派，是毛主席对我们的最大信任，是左派广大群众对我们的殷切期望。毛主席教导我们：红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。过去，我们和广大人民紧紧团结在一起，打败了美蒋反动派，建立了人民的江山；今天，我们还要最坚决地站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决地和左派广大群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”全连同志一致表示：今后不论什么时候，只要无产阶级革命派需要我们支援，我们就迅速地坚决地毫无保留地前去支援。我们要誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
