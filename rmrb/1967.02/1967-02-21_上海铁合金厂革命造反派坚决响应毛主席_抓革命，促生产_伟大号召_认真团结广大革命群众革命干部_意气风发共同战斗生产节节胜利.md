The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Iron Alloy Factory resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They earnestly unite with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and with high spirits, they fight together, achieving continuous victories in production.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) — After seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Shanghai Iron Alloy Factory have united the entire factory's revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. They continue to uphold the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to pioneer. They constantly strengthen proletarian revolutionary discipline and resolutely implement the great directive of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao on "grasping revolution and promoting production." They have swiftly reversed the serious impact that the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind has had on production, achieving significant victories. Currently, the entire factory, on the basis of over-fulfilling the January production plan, is advancing with momentum, and production in the first half of February has been steadily rising.

The main products of the Iron Alloy Factory, such as ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, and ferrochrome, are important raw materials for smelting high-quality steel and advanced alloy steel. The supply of these products directly affects whether many steel plants in Shanghai and across the country can fully complete the national plan.

However, this factory, which is so crucial to our country's socialist construction, was in a state of chaos under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. At the beginning of this year and the end of last year, production was in a mess. The stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, unwilling to accept their failure, stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, launching a ferocious new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line. Many deceived workers left their production posts, and the reserves of production materials such as quartzite, iron filings, lime, and coke became increasingly scarce, threatening the production workshops with the danger of shutting down furnaces and stopping production.

At this critical moment, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the factory seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, establishing a Revolutionary Production Committee and bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and working intellectuals. As long as these people take their destiny into their own hands and have a Marxist-Leninist line, not shirking problems but solving them with an active attitude, any human difficulty can be overcome." After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Iron Alloy Factory immediately took on the attitude of masters, bravely and tenaciously, with high spirits, entering the battle. They launched a fierce counterattack against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses who were falsely labeled as "anti-party elements," "counter-revolutionaries," and other fabricated charges, most intimately felt: "Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer." They said, Chairman Mao most supports the proletarian revolutionary cadres, and the proletarian revolutionary cadres most listen to Chairman Mao's words. The great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" is personally proposed by Chairman Mao, and we proletarian revolutionary cadres must resolutely implement it! They said, we proletarian revolutionary cadres will prove with facts: after exposing a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, our revolution and production will advance even faster! The proletarian revolutionary cadres are not afraid of any demons or ghosts, and no difficulties can intimidate them!

At a critical moment when some deceived workers left their production posts and the danger of shutting down furnaces was imminent, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the No. 10 electric furnace collectively studied Chairman Mao's quotations at the furnace: "Our comrades must see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength and courage. They said, in the past few years, modern revisionists bullied us because of the shortage of ferrochrome and sold us substandard products; a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party conspired to stop production, completely in line with the needs of imperialism and modern revisionism. Getting production back on track is not just an ordinary economic battle, but an extremely sharp class struggle. When there were no people at the furnace, the proletarian revolutionary cadres workers unhesitatingly stepped in; when there was no one to take over at the end of the shift, they continued to work. The revolutionary workers of the No. 10 furnace responded to those who tried to force them to stop production: as long as there are proletarian revolutionary cadres, even if there is only one person, the furnace will not be shut down! For a month, the roaring flames of the No. 10 furnace have not been extinguished. This relatively old furnace in the factory's smelting equipment, in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary cadres workers, not only made up for the production shortfall caused by the disruption of the counter-revolutionary economic wind but also achieved outstanding results, timely smelting many ferrochrome urgently needed by steel plants.

In the struggle to "grasp revolution and promote production," the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Iron Alloy Factory remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution." They realized that to carry out the revolution, expose the capitalist-roaders within the Party, one must firmly believe in the masses; to get production back on track and thoroughly defeat the counter-revolutionary economic wind, one must also firmly believe in the masses. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of this factory earnestly unite with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all aspects. When the coke was about to run out, some proletarian revolutionary cadres workers and revolutionary masses voluntarily gave up their rest time to help with loading, quickly transporting several hundred tons of coke into the factory. When the stored lime was about to run out, the revolutionary masses responsible for supply rushed to the lime factory, helping the lime factory overcome production difficulties, ensuring the timely supply of the urgently needed lime for this factory.

In the struggle to resolutely implement the policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production," the Iron Alloy Factory has received support from many proletarian revolutionary organizations outside the factory. The proletarian revolutionary organizations of the Shanghai automobile and inland waterway transportation departments broke through various obstacles set by a handful of malicious elements, timely completing the task of transporting raw materials and materials. Some proletarian revolutionary comrades said, we are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and in the power struggle, we must implement great unity, mutual support, and mutual assistance; in the production struggle, we must also closely cooperate. To build our country into an unshakable proletarian iron fortress, in any struggle, the proletarian revolutionary cadres must unite, fight together, and win together.

The continuous victories achieved by the Iron Alloy Factory indicate that to truly grasp the revolution and promote production, one must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "the army advances, production increases by an inch, strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible," strengthening proletarian revolutionary discipline. Just after seizing power, the factory still discovered people not coming to work, and some transport trucks leaving without proper approval. These situations caught the attention of the proletarian revolutionary organizations. A few proletarian revolutionary organizations, after discussion, believed that such free and disorderly, undisciplined behavior is incompatible with proletarian democracy. The proletarian revolutionary cadres have seized power and must thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary bourgeois discipline, but must seriously implement proletarian revolutionary discipline. Only by doing so can we achieve one victory after another. After consultation, the proletarian revolutionary organizations of the Iron Alloy Factory initially established some revolutionary disciplines and made some necessary temporary regulations, with everyone supervising and adhering to them. A revolutionary, new production order has begun to gradually take shape.

Chairman Mao said: "A brand-new social system must be established on the basis of the old system, and it must clear away this basis. The remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system always linger in people's minds and are reluctant to leave easily." Some leaders of the proletarian revolutionary organizations of the Iron Alloy Factory have a particularly deep understanding of this teaching of Chairman Mao. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, after seizing power, they constantly struggle against old habitual forces and the remnants of feudalism and capitalism in their own minds, constantly studying the "Three Articles." Whenever there is time, some comrades go to the most intense production posts, not leaving production, not leaving the masses, not becoming officials or lords, and resisting the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. The proletarian revolutionary cadres workers and all revolutionary staff of the factory together grasp the revolution and promote production. Recently, various important products such as ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, and ferrochrome have been sent to various steel plants across the country according to the state plan, timely supporting the production of the steel industry.

    上海铁合金厂革命造反派坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召
    认真团结广大革命群众革命干部  意气风发共同战斗生产节节胜利
    新华社上海十九日电　上海铁合金厂无产阶级革命派工人在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权以后，团结全厂广大革命群众和革命干部，继续发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，不断加强无产阶级的革命纪律性，坚决贯彻执行我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，迅速扭转了反革命修正主义的经济主义黑风给生产带来的严重影响，取得了重大胜利。目前，全厂在超额完成一月份生产计划的基础上，乘胜前进，二月上半月生产持续稳步上升。
    铁合金厂生产的主要产品矽铁、锰铁、铬铁等，是冶炼优质钢和高级合金钢的重要原料，产品供应上海以及全国许多钢铁厂。这个厂生产计划完成得好坏，直接影响许多厂能否全面完成国家计划。
    但是，这个对我国社会主义建设关系这么重大的工厂，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的把持下，今年年初和去年年底，生产却搞得一团糟。坚持资产阶级反动路线的少数顽固分子，不甘心于自己的失败，煽起了反革命的经济主义黑风，向无产阶级革命路线进行猖狂的新反扑。不少受蒙蔽的工人，离开了生产岗位，生产用的石英石、铁屑、石灰、焦炭等原料和材料，储备越来越少，生产车间面临着停炉、停产的严重威胁。
    在这关键时刻，工厂的无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权，成立了革命生产委员会，勇敢地担负起革命和生产两副重担。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”铁合金厂的无产阶级革命派掌握了大权以后，立即以主人翁的姿态，英勇顽强、意气风发地投入了战斗。他们向资产阶级反动路线的新反扑发起了猛烈的回击。曾经被加上“反党分子”、“反革命”等莫须有罪名的革命干部和革命群众，最最亲切地体会到：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。他们说，毛主席最支持无产阶级革命派，无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话。“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，是毛主席他老人家亲自提出的，我们无产阶级革命派就是要最坚决地执行！他们说，我们无产阶级革命派一定用事实证明：揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们的革命和生产将以更快的步伐向前迈进！无产阶级革命派什么妖魔鬼怪都不怕，任何困难也吓不倒！
    在有些受蒙蔽的工人离开生产岗位，就要发生停炉危险的严重时刻，十号电炉的无产阶级革命派工人和革命群众，集体在炉前学习毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的教导，给了他们无穷的力量和勇气。他们说，前几年，现代修正主义者欺负我们铬铁少，把不合格品卖给我们；党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，阴谋停产，完全是迎合帝国主义、现代修正主义的需要。把生产搞上去，不是普普通通的经济仗，而是一场极其尖锐的阶级斗争。炉子上缺了人，无产阶级革命派工人毫不犹疑地顶上去；下班时没人接班，他们又接着干。十号炉的革命工人对一小撮妄图迫使他们停产的家伙的回答是：只要有无产阶级革命派在，就是只有一个人，也绝不停炉！一个月来，十号炉的熊熊炉火一直没有熄灭。这座在全厂冶炼设备中较为陈旧的十号炉，在无产阶级革命派工人手里，不仅把因为受反革命经济主义黑风的破坏而欠下的产量补上，还创造了出色的成绩，按时冶炼出了许多钢厂急需的铬铁。
    在“抓革命，促生产”的斗争中，铁合金厂的无产阶级革命派牢记毛主席的教导：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”他们体会到，搞革命，揪出党内走资本主义道路的当权派，必须坚定地相信群众；把生产搞好，彻底打垮反革命经济主义黑风，同样要坚定地相信群众。这个厂的无产阶级革命派认真地团结革命群众和革命干部，充分发挥各方面的积极性。焦炭快用光了，有些无产阶级革命派工人和革命群众自动放弃休息时间，帮助装车，很快把几百吨焦炭运进厂。库存的石灰快用完了，负责供应工作的革命群众赶到石灰厂，帮助石灰厂克服了生产中遇到的困难，使本厂急需的石灰得到及时供应。
    铁合金厂在坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”方针的斗争中，得到了厂外许多无产阶级革命派组织的支持。上海市汽车、内河运输部门的无产阶级革命派组织，冲破一小撮别有用心的坏家伙的种种刁难，及时完成了运送原料、材料的任务。一些无产阶级革命派同志说，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，在夺权斗争中要实行大联合，相互支援，相互支持；在生产斗争中也要紧密协作。为了把我国建设成为永不变色的无产阶级铁打江山，在任何斗争中，无产阶级革命派都要团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    铁合金厂不断取得的新胜利表明，真正抓好革命，促好生产，必须坚决遵循毛主席的“军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，加强无产阶级的革命纪律性。刚刚夺了权，厂内仍然不断发现有的人不来上班，有的运货汽车不经过一定的批准手续就随便开走等等情况。这些情况引起了无产阶级革命派组织的注意。几个无产阶级革命派组织经过讨论认为，这种自由散漫、无组织无纪律的行为，和无产阶级的大民主格格不入。无产阶级革命派夺了权，需要彻底砸烂反革命的资产阶级纪律，但必须认真执行无产阶级的革命纪律。只有这样做，才能夺取一个又一个的新胜利。经过协商，铁合金厂的无产阶级革命派组织初步建立了一些革命的纪律，作出了一些必要的临时规定，大家互相督促，共同遵守。一个革命的、新生的生产秩序，已开始逐步建立起来。
    毛主席说：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”铁合金厂的一些无产阶级革命派组织的负责人，对毛主席的这一教导体会特别深刻。他们根据毛主席的教导，在夺权以后，不断同旧的习惯势力以及自己头脑里的封建主义、资本主义残余影响作斗争，不断学习“老三篇”。有了空，一些同志就到最紧张的生产岗位上，不脱离生产，不脱离群众，不做官当老爷，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。无产阶级革命派工人和全厂革命的职工一道，大抓革命，大促生产。最近以来，矽铁、锰铁、铬铁等各种重要产品，按照国家计划源源从这里运往各地钢厂，及时支援钢铁工业的生产。
