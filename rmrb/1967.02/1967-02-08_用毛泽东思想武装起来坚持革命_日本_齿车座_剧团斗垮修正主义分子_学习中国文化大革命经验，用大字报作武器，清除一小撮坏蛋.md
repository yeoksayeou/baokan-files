Editor's Note: Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is not only a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people to carry out revolution and socialist construction, but also a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are terrified and hate Mao Zedong Thought to the core. They resort to every possible means to attack, slander, and resist Mao Zedong Thought. However, the more they do so, the faster Mao Zedong Thought spreads throughout the world.

The revolutionary people and Marxist-Leninists of the world have, in the course of their resolute struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, come to recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth. They learn, grasp, and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the course of struggle, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. The Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of Japan, who study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and struggle against modern revisionists, are a vivid example of this.

Chairman Mao said: "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, grasped by more and more revolutionary people of the world, will accelerate the demise of the old world and hasten the birth of a new world, red and radiant under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 6th, Tokyo: According to a report from the East Communication Agency, the progressive theater troupe "Haguruma-Za" in Japan, which has consistently adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line and frequently studies Mao Zedong Thought, recently waged a struggle against a handful of revisionist elements within the troupe and expelled them.

Since its establishment in 1952, "Haguruma-Za" has armed itself with Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," continuously studied Chairman Mao's works, and deeply engaged with workers, peasants, and students. They learned from the experience of Chinese revolutionary literature and art, and strove to strengthen Japan-China friendship and unity. Their artistic activities have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants in Yamaguchi Prefecture and western Japan.

Japanese revisionists have long intended to interfere with such a revolutionary troupe and attempt to pull it to the right. In 1960, when the Japanese people were fighting against the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, "Haguruma-Za" performed a play based on the theme of peasant armed uprising. However, those revisionist elements said, "It is inappropriate to stage a play about overthrowing the ruling class by force at this time," attempting to obstruct it. However, "Haguruma-Za" did not listen and insisted on performing, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the broad masses of workers and peasants, with nearly 200,000 spectators watching the play.

Since the second half of last year, the Japanese revisionists' sabotage of "Haguruma-Za" has escalated. In September, a cultural official from the Japanese revisionist leadership group in Tokyo went to Yamaguchi City and slandered the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution to the members of "Haguruma-Za." They also maliciously accused the troupe of "blindly following foreigners" and tried to peddle their counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. They also incited nine infiltrators into the theater to demand "higher wages" as a pretext to disrupt the troupe's performances.

The revolutionary members of "Haguruma-Za" waged a resolute struggle against these saboteurs. They learned from the experience of the Chinese cultural revolution and used the powerful weapon of big-character posters to fight, finally expelling these elements and defending the glorious tradition of "Haguruma-Za."

According to a member of "Haguruma-Za," they began studying Chairman Mao's works since the troupe's establishment. Chairman Mao's great support and encouragement for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle added boundless courage to the struggle of the members of "Haguruma-Za."

The Japanese people, who are in the midst of struggle, love Chairman Mao's works, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries led by the United States.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来坚持革命
    日本“齿车座”剧团斗垮修正主义分子
    学习中国文化大革命经验，用大字报作武器，清除一小撮坏蛋
    编者按：毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民进行革命和社会主义建设的强大思想武器，而且是全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命。它们千方百计地攻击、诬蔑、抵制毛泽东思想。但是它们越是这样干，毛泽东思想在全世界就传播得越快。
    全世界革命人民和马克思列宁主义者，正是在同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行坚决斗争中，认识到了毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，并且在斗争过程中不断学习毛泽东思想，掌握毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想。日本的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，活学活用毛主席著作，同现代修正主义者作斗争，就是生动的例子。
    毛主席说：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想为全世界越来越多的革命人民所掌握，必将加速旧世界的灭亡，促使一个在毛泽东思想光辉普照下的红彤彤的新世界更快地诞生。
    据新华社六日讯　东京消息：据东方通讯社报道，一贯坚持无产阶级革命的文艺路线、经常学习毛泽东思想的日本进步剧团“齿车座”，最近对剧团内的一小撮修正主义分子进行了斗争，并把他们赶出了这个剧团。
    “齿车座”从一九五二年建团以后，就用毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》武装起来，不断地学习毛主席著作，深入工农和学生，学习中国革命文艺的经验，努力加强日中友好团结，他们的艺术活动受到了山口县和西日本广大工农群众的欢迎。
    日本修正主义者早就蓄意干涉这样一个革命的剧团，企图把它拉向右转。一九六○年当日本人民进行反对修改日美安全条约的斗争时，“齿车座”就演出以农民武装起义为题材的剧目。可是那些修正主义分子却说“这时候上演用武力打倒当权派的剧是不适当的”，企图进行阻挠，但是，“齿车座”不听那一套，坚持演出，受到广大工农群众的热烈欢迎，有将近二十万名观众观看了这个剧。
    去年下半年以来，日本修正主义者破坏“齿车座”的活动变本加厉。九月份，日本修正主义领导集团的一个负责文化工作的干部，从东京跑到山口市，向“齿车座”的团员们大肆诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且诬蔑剧团“盲从外国”，极力兜售他们那一套反革命修正主义黑货。他们还唆使打入剧场的九个爪牙以要求“提高工资”为由，破坏剧团的公演活动。
    “齿车座”的革命团员们对这些破坏分子进行了坚决的斗争。他们学习中国文化大革命的经验，用大字报这一有力武器进行战斗，终于把这一小撮人赶出剧团，保卫了“齿车座”的光荣传统。
    据“齿车座”的一位团员说，他们从建团时起就开始学习毛主席著作。毛泽东主席对日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的巨大支持和鼓励，使“齿车座”的团员增添了无穷的斗争勇气。（附图片）
