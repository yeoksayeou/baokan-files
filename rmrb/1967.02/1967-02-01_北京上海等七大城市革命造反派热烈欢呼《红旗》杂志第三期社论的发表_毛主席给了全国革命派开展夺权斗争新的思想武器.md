Revolutionary rebels in Beijing, Shanghai, and five other major cities warmly welcome the publication of the editorial in the third issue of *Red Flag* magazine. Chairman Mao has provided the revolutionary masses nationwide with new ideological weapons for the struggle to seize power.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated January 31, revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Shenyang warmly welcomed the publication of the editorial "On the Struggle of the Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels to Seize Power" in the third issue of *Red Flag* magazine in 1967. They eagerly read and spread the word, excitedly saying that this editorial, based on the brilliant thoughts of our great leader Chairman Mao, provides a profound theoretical exposition of the experiences of the proletarian revolutionary rebels in seizing power. It is another extremely important programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, providing new powerful ideological weapons for the proletarian revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of laborers to complete the struggle to seize power victoriously.

Revolutionary rebels unanimously expressed that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, and fight to the end with the bourgeoisie and their agents within the party. They will seize all the powers of the party, government, finance, and culture from the hands of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and consolidate them, allowing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to fly high on all fronts, welcoming the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives from more than 30 revolutionary mass organizations, including the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Capital Workers, the Revolutionary Rebel United Committee of the First Ministry of Machinery, and the Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, were discussing the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary rebels last night when they heard the broadcast of the *Red Flag* magazine editorial. They were all elated and inspired. They said, this editorial is the action guide for the great alliance and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary rebels, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a new victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! They immediately wrote an urgent appeal to all revolutionary rebels in the city: "Abandon illusions, prepare for struggle. The revolutionary rebels of Beijing should unite to the maximum extent and seize power comprehensively and thoroughly from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road!" The red rebel fighters of the Red Rebel Liaison Station of the Capital Workers enthusiastically expressed that they would immediately take action, study Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought to rectify the ranks, and build an ironclad combat team of proletarianization to strive to the end for the great strategic task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road as proposed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Revolutionary rebels from universities and colleges in the capital, after hearing the broadcast, quickly set up loudspeakers and went out to the streets for propaganda at night.

The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, who first initiated the struggle to seize power, warmly welcomed this editorial as a summary of the experiences of the proletarian revolutionary rebels in China uniting to seize power, an extremely important programmatic document that elevates the struggle to seize power to a new stage, and a new weapon of struggle given by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the proletarian revolutionary rebels. Revolutionary workers and students responsible for the city's water and land transportation and commercial command expressed: The proletarian revolutionary rebels must unite to seize power, unite to hold power, and unite to fight this life-and-death battle to the final victory. Revolutionary rebel workers at the Fifth Loading Area of Shanghai Port said excitedly: After seizing power, we must consolidate it. To consolidate, we must, according to the spirit of the editorial, launch a struggle to criticize and repudiate selfishness and promote public spirit within the depths of our souls, eliminating various selfish thoughts. Some rebel workers also said: We have seized power now, but we cannot simply take over the original institutions of the bourgeois dictatorship implemented by the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, making some superficial reforms. We must create new forms of political power organizations and carry out a thorough revolution on the superstructure of the state machine to adapt to the new socialist economic base.

After hearing the broadcast of the editorial in the third issue of *Red Flag* magazine, revolutionary rebels in Tianjin today took to the streets in groups, beating drums and gongs, setting off firecrackers, and holding high portraits of Chairman Mao to express their joy. Some held study sessions and discussions. Recently, more than 20 revolutionary organizations, including the Revolutionary Rebel Field Army of Workers and Peasants in Tianjin and the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Textile System in Tianjin, implemented the great alliance and launched the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The core leaders of these revolutionary organizations deeply felt that the publication of this editorial was very timely, pointing out the direction of advance at a critical moment in the struggle. The core leaders of the Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee listened to the broadcast and specially held a meeting to discuss how to deal with the issue of cadres. They unanimously agreed that those proletarian power-holders who support and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao should fight together with them, allowing them to participate in the leadership and jointly launch the struggle to seize power with the revolutionary masses.

Many proletarian revolutionary rebel fighters in Xi'an today took to the streets joyfully, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, warmly welcoming the publication of this editorial and warmly welcoming the support of our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, for the proletarian revolutionary rebels. Revolutionary rebel fighters said: This editorial shines with the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought and is another brilliant document in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. The revolutionary workers of the Cultural Revolution United Temporary Command of Regal Company unanimously believed that to achieve victory in the struggle to seize power, we must resolutely implement the great alliance. This great alliance can only be under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve this great alliance, we must fight against various erroneous thoughts, and all compromising and reformist ideas must be thoroughly overturned, and all small-groupism, sectarianism, and dispersionism must be overcome.

When this editorial was broadcast on the evening of January 30, many comrades in the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Headquarters of the Directly Affiliated Institutions of the Central-South Bureau in Guangzhou gathered around the radio, listening and taking notes. The next day, as soon as the newspaper was published, the headquarters distributed the newspaper to the affiliated combat organizations for study. Everyone unanimously agreed that this editorial is a programmatic document guiding the proletarian revolutionary rebels to seize power. At this critical moment in our struggle, it points out the direction of our struggle. As the editorial analyzes, after the power of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road is seized by the masses, they will still try every means to counter-seize power, attempting to stage a comeback and trying to shift the contradictions between the masses and the power-holders onto the revolutionary rebels, aiming to crush the revolutionary rebels. We must mobilize the masses to timely expose their plots and consolidate the power we have seized. They expressed that they would rectify their thoughts and ranks according to the spirit of the editorial and resolutely not become "figures that appear briefly on the historical stage."

Many revolutionary rebel fighters in Chengdu listened to the broadcast of this important editorial on the evening of January 30. They joyfully said that this is the weapon of struggle given to us by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Revolutionary rebel workers at Chengdu Machine Tool Factory said that the problems we encountered in the struggle to seize power in our factory are exactly the problems raised in the editorial. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are not willing to die, plotting sabotage and fake seizures of power. After we seize power, they instruct some people to give us trouble and watch our jokes. However, relying on the great alliance of the left, we unite with the broad revolutionary masses, correctly and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and foil their plots, achieving victory in the struggle to seize power. Revolutionary rebels in many suburban communes believe that this editorial is a great support and encouragement to the revolutionary rebels. Revolutionary rebel fighters in Yongfeng Commune said that we will resolutely follow the spirit of the editorial, thoroughly seize the power of the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road from the bottom up, smash bureaucratic institutions, and smash the revisionist system, building the vast countryside into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad red rebels in Shenyang listened to the radio broadcast repeatedly with excited hearts. They said, this editorial is great, saying what we revolutionary rebels want to say, pointing out a clear direction for us revolutionary rebels to seize power. Revolutionary rebels at Shenyang Silk Mill said that the proletarian revolutionary rebels unite to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The enemy will definitely play new tricks to sabotage, and the struggle will definitely have ups and downs. We are fully prepared in spirit. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "Abandon illusions, prepare for struggle," resolutely repel the counterattacks of the class enemies, and firmly grasp the powers of the party, government, finance, and culture in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary rebels. Many red rebels expressed that they would resolutely unite with all proletarian revolutionary rebels in the city, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, and form a surging cultural revolution army, letting the "January Revolution" storm sweep across the city and the province, seizing and consolidating one by one the fortresses occupied by the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, not resting until complete victory is achieved.

    北京上海等七大城市革命造反派热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志第三期社论的发表
    毛主席给了全国革命派开展夺权斗争新的思想武器
    革命造反派决心用毛泽东思想整顿队伍，实行大联合，团结一切革命力量，同资产阶级及其在党内的代理人决战到底，把大权统统夺回来，创造适合新的社会主义经济基础的新的政权组织形式。
    据新华社三十一日讯　北京、上海、天津、广州、西安、成都、沈阳等七大城市的无产阶级革命造反派，热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志一九六七年第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》的发表。他们争相阅读，奔走相告，兴奋地说，这篇社论根据我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想，对无产阶级革命造反派夺权斗争的经验作了精辟的理论阐述，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的又一个极其重要的纲领性文件，为全国无产阶级革命造反派和广大劳动人民胜利完成夺权斗争提供了新的强大思想武器。
    广大革命造反派一致表示，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，团结广大革命群众，同资产阶级及其在党内的代理人决战到底，把党、政、财、文等一切大权从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里统统夺回来，并巩固下去，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在一切阵地上高高飘扬，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    首都职工革命造反总部、一机部革命造反联合委员会和北京航空学院红旗战斗队等三十多个革命群众组织的代表，昨晚正在讨论无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权时，听到广播《红旗》杂志社论，个个欢欣鼓舞。他们说，这篇社论是无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的行动指南，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利！他们当场就写了向全市革命造反派的《紧急呼吁》：“丢掉幻想，准备斗争，北京市的革命造反派最大限度地联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派全面彻底夺权！”首都职工红色造反总联络站红色造反派战士们热烈表示，立即行动起来，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想整顿队伍，建设一支无产阶级化的钢铁战斗队伍，为完成毛主席和党中央提出的向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权这一伟大战略任务而奋斗到底。首都大专院校革命造反派听到广播以后，纷纷开动广播车，连夜走向街头进行宣传。
    首先掀起夺权斗争大风暴的上海广大革命造反派，热烈欢呼这篇社论是对我国无产阶级革命派联合起来进行夺权斗争的经验的总结，是把夺权斗争提高到一个新阶段的极其重要的纲领性文件，是毛主席和党中央交给无产阶级革命派的新的斗争武器。担任全市水陆交通运输和商业指挥工作的革命工人和革命学生进行了座谈。他们表示：无产阶级革命派要联合起来夺权，联合起来掌权，联合起来把这场生死决战坚持到最后胜利。上海港务局第五装卸区的革命造反派工人兴奋地说：夺了权，还要巩固。要巩固，就要按照社论的精神，先在我们造反派的灵魂深处展开一场破私立公的斗争，排除种种私心杂念。有些造反派工人还说：我们现在夺了权，但不能把原来党内那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派实行资产阶级专政的机构，原封不动地接收下来，作些皮毛的改良。我们要创造新的政权组织形式，把国家机器这个上层建筑也闹个彻底革命，来适合新的社会主义经济基础。
    天津市广大革命造反派听到《红旗》第三期社论的广播以后，今天高举着毛主席画像，成群结队地上街敲锣打鼓，燃放鞭炮，表示庆贺，有的进行了学习和讨论座谈。天津市工农学革命造反野战兵团、天津市纺织系统革命造反总部等二十多个革命组织，最近实行了大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展夺权斗争。这些革命组织的负责人深深感觉到这篇社论发表的非常及时，在斗争的关键时刻给他们指明了前进的方向。中共天津市委机关革命造反派联合总部的核心领导成员听了广播后，专门开会研究如何对待领导干部的问题。他们一致认为，凡是拥护和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级当权派，就要和他们在一起共同战斗，让他们参加领导，和革命群众一起开展夺权斗争。
    西安许多无产阶级革命造反派战士今天兴高采烈地走上街头，高举着毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，热烈欢呼这篇社论的发表，热烈欢呼我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席对无产阶级革命造反派的支持。革命造反派战士们说：这篇社论，闪烁着伟大的毛泽东思想的光芒，是我国无产阶级文化大革命中又一篇光辉的文献。庆安公司文化革命联合临时指挥部的革命职工一致认为，要取得夺权斗争的胜利，必须坚决实行大联合，这个大联合，只能是在毛泽东思想指导下的大联合。实现这种大联合，必须同形形色色的错误思想进行斗争，那些折衷主义、改良主义的东西必须统统打倒，那些小团体主义、宗派主义、分散主义的东西，必须统统克服掉。
    这篇社论在三十日晚上广播的时候，在广州市的中南局直属机关革命造反派联络总部的许多同志聚集在收音机旁，边听边作记录。第二天报纸一出版，总部就把报纸分发给所属的各战斗组织学习。大家一致认为：这篇社论是指导无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的纲领性文件。在我们斗争最关键的时刻，给我们指明了斗争的方向。他们说，正如社论所分析的那样，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在他们的权力被革命群众夺掉以后，还千方百计地进行反夺权，妄图反攻倒算，企图把群众同当权派的矛盾转移到革命造反派身上来，把革命造反派压垮。我们必须发动群众及时识破它们的阴谋，把已经夺取的权力牢牢地巩固下来。他们表示要根据社论的精神整顿思想，整顿队伍，坚决不作“历史舞台上昙花一现的人物”。
    成都市许多革命造反派战士在三十日晚上收听了这篇重要社论的广播。他们欢欣鼓舞地说，这是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央给我们的斗争武器。成都机床厂的革命造反派工人说，我们厂在进行夺权斗争中碰到的问题，正是社论中提出的问题。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是不甘心死亡的，他们阴谋搞破坏，搞假夺权，在我们夺权以后，又指使一些人给我们出难题，要看我们的笑话。但是我们依靠左派的大联合，团结广大革命群众，正确地严格地区分两类矛盾，粉碎了他们的阴谋，取得了夺权斗争的胜利。郊区许多公社的革命造反派认为，这篇社论是对革命造反派的巨大支持和鼓舞。永丰公社的革命造反派战士说，我们坚决按照社论的精神，彻底地自下而上地夺党内走资本主义道路当权派的权，砸烂官僚主义机构，粉碎修正主义制度，把广大农村建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    沈阳市广大红色造反者满怀激动的心情一遍又一遍地收听电台的广播。他们说，这篇社论太好了，说出了我们革命造反派心里要说的话，为我们革命造反派进行夺权斗争指出了明确方向。沈阳市丝织厂的革命造反派说，无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权，是无产阶级和资产阶级的你死我活的决战，敌人必然会玩弄新花招进行破坏，斗争必然会有反复，我们有充分的精神准备。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”，坚决打退阶级敌人的反扑，把党、政、财、文大权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。许多红色造反者表示，坚决和全市无产阶级革命造反派联合起来，团结广大革命群众，组成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，让“一月革命”的风暴席卷全市、全省，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所盘踞的堡垒，一个一个地夺过来，一个一个地巩固，不获全胜，决不收兵。
