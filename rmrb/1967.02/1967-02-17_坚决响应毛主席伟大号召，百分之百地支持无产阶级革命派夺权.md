Edition: 3

In the storm of revolution where the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, the soldiers and officers of the Shaanxi Provincial Military District of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on the fundamental issue of revolution being the issue of state power and serving the people wholeheartedly, have stood out at the critical moment of the revolutionary left's seizure of power. They fear no obstacles and fully support and aid the seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Shaanxi, creating new merits for the socialist revolutionary cause. This is the result of their high举ing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. What follows is the experience of the soldiers and officers of the Third Company of a certain unit of the Shaanxi Provincial Military District in supporting the seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels.

Head Can Be Cut Off, Blood Can Be Shed, But the Revolutionary Power of the Proletariat Cannot Be Lost

Sergeant Wei Zemin

Our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating it. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces precisely to maintain their power." In supporting the seizure of power by the revolutionary left in Shaanxi, I studied Chairman Mao's teaching and deeply understood that having power means having everything, losing power means losing everything. The proletariat must firmly grasp power in their own hands; only in this way can the revolution be carried through to the end and the brilliant cause of socialism and communism be completed.

Before liberation, the state machinery was completely in the hands of the three great enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They carried out brutal oppression and exploitation of the broad masses of laboring people. My father worked half his life as a slave for the landlords and capitalists, but he didn't even have the rights to dress, eat, or speak. In the end, he suffered the fate of being separated from his wife and children, his family destroyed, and his life ruined. Under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the laboring people rose up in revolution, overthrowing the three great mountains oppressing the Chinese people, and seizing power from the reactionaries. The laboring people thus became the masters of the state.

The class enemies are not willing to die. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat in China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people." This is exactly the case. Over the past seventeen years, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee have held the major powers of party, government, economy, and culture in Shaanxi. They have opposed Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, implemented bourgeois dictatorship, and turned Shaanxi into an independent kingdom of revisionism. During the Cultural Revolution, they openly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, distorted the policies of the Party Central Committee, reversed the direction of the struggle, incited the masses to fight each other, and labeled cadres, students, and workers who gave them advice as "ambitious people" and "extortionists," threatening to "settle accounts later." They used the economic power they had seized to spread the rotten goods of counter-revolutionary economism, opposing Chairman Mao's personally proposed policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They also used the former Shaanxi Daily to publish a series of reactionary editorials, vigorously erasing class struggle, deceiving, and misleading the revolutionary masses. Why were they able to act so recklessly? Ultimately, it was because they still held the major powers.

Now, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Shaanxi, with the full support of the People's Liberation Army, have seized all the major powers held by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the provincial and municipal party committees and other units. This revolutionary action is excellent, and we fully support it a thousand times, ten thousand times! Chairman Mao calls on us: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses. We firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and are willing to sacrifice our lives to defend Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, Mao Zedong Thought, and the power of the proletariat. Head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but the revolutionary power of the proletariat cannot be lost! If a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road dare to counterattack the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, we will firmly suppress them with our rifles.

Supporting the Seizure of Power by the Revolutionary Left is the Most Important Service to the People

Model Soldier Zhai Haisheng

We firmly respond to the great call of our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses. In supporting the seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Shaanxi, we once again studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." "Standing firmly with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." We deeply understand that the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat rise up to seize power from the power-holders taking the capitalist road, ensuring that our country remains red for thousands of generations, is the greatest politics of the proletariat and the most fundamental interest. We actively participate in and support the seizure of power by the revolutionary left, fulfilling the most important political responsibility and the greatest service to the people. All the comrades in our company propose: The demands of the revolutionary left are orders. Whether it is climbing the knife mountain or entering the fire sea, we will immediately set out and fully support.

On the night of the joint action by the revolutionary rebels in Shaanxi to seize power, at the command of the revolutionary rebels, our unit immediately set out for armed patrols, firmly defending the seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels. After the victory of the seizure of power, we immediately organized propaganda teams to go out and propagate the great victory of the revolutionary rebels and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When a handful of people with ulterior motives incited some uninformed masses to try to occupy the Shaanxi People's Broadcasting Station, we stood out and fought alongside the revolutionary left, using Chairman Mao's instructions to awaken the deceived masses and defend the safety of the broadcasting station, allowing Chairman Mao's voice to be timely transmitted to the broad revolutionary masses.

In the struggle, we have a standard for judging right and wrong and distinguishing friends from enemies, which is: Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we are close to them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we fight against them. Once, while on guard duty, a rightist element provoked us, saying, "Who do you support? You are wrong!" We firmly and decisively replied: "Whoever supports Chairman Mao, whoever firmly carries out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, whoever is a true revolutionary, we will firmly support them forever. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will firmly oppose them, firmly counterattack them, and firmly suppress them!" A few words drove that guy away in defeat.

We regard firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's orders and firmly supporting the seizure of power by the revolutionary left as the greatest honor because this is the most important service to the people. In the future, we will better serve the people by continuing to support and defend the seizure of power by the revolutionary left.

Grip the Rifle, Defend the Fruits of the Seizure of Power

Political Instructor Wang Zejun

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The new social system has just been established and needs a period of consolidation. It is impossible to think that the new system is completely consolidated once it is established." The various powers seized by the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat from the power-holders taking the capitalist road must be firmly grasped and consolidated, and arduous work and fierce struggles must be carried out. This is the glorious task facing all revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary factions of the proletariat, and it is also an important responsibility of the People's Liberation Army.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause." This is exactly the case. Some units in Shaanxi Province, such as organs, factories, and schools, where the power has been seized from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, are not reconciled to their destruction. Some have gone underground from public view, waiting for an opportunity to sabotage, while others continue to manipulate some counter-revolutionary organizations from behind the scenes, attempting to seize back the "seals" they have lost. We, the People's Liberation Army, are the people's army created by Chairman Mao, "an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." We are the pillars of the proletarian dictatorship. For those reactionary elements, we firmly follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Implement dictatorship, suppress these people, allow them to behave only in an orderly manner, and do not allow them to talk or act recklessly." If they dare to stir up trouble and engage in counter-revolutionary activities, we will suppress them without mercy.

We are revolutionary warriors of the proletariat. We always remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "the People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force." We grasp revolution, promote preparedness for war, promote production, grip our rifles, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, guard our combat posts, and are ready at any time to smash any sabotage activities by domestic and foreign enemies, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and defend the victory of the seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat!

Support a Thousand Times, Support Ten Thousand Times,
Arming the Revolutionary Left with Mao Zedong Thought is the Greatest Support

Model Soldier Zhang Fusuo

In supporting the seizure of power by the broad revolutionary left in Shaanxi, we deeply feel that the revolutionary left needs support from all sides, but supporting a thousand times, supporting ten thousand times, arming the revolutionary left with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support.

In this seizure of power struggle, our company was responsible for guarding the Shaanxi People's Broadcasting Station. Before the seizure of power, the revolutionary left in the broadcasting station was still in the minority. At that time, they were surrounded by some people with ulterior motives, inciting the masses, and had been besieged for more than twenty hours without food, water, or rest. Some people threatened to storm the broadcasting station, take over the station, and not allow the station to broadcast the voice from Beijing. At this critical moment, we remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." We stood out, broke through numerous obstacles, overcame various difficulties, and sent coats, hot water, and meals to the besieged revolutionary left; but more importantly, we sent them Mao Zedong Thought. We wrote Chairman Mao's quotations into cards and sent them to each comrade. We read together with them, in response to the situation at that time: "This army has an unyielding spirit, it wants to overwhelm all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and arduous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." As we read, the revolutionary comrades suddenly gained boundless strength. Although they had not slept for two days, everyone was full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm, persevering in the struggle. Many people excitedly said: "With the great Mao Zedong Thought guiding us, and the support of the Liberation Army, no matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid, and no matter what kind of enemy, we can defeat it." The announcers, under extremely difficult conditions, firmly guarded their posts and continued their work, timely transmitting Chairman Mao's voice to the 18 million people of the province.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has the highest prestige and the greatest power, and is the strongest and most powerful weapon. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary left of the Shaanxi People's Broadcasting Station finally won the victory of the seizure of power struggle.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with 700 million people, and needs a unified thought, revolutionary thought, correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought. With this thought, we can maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and have a firm and correct political direction." In the current great proletarian cultural revolution, as long as we arm the revolutionary left and the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, the great proletarian cultural revolution will definitely achieve thorough victory. In this great revolutionary struggle, every revolutionary warrior must faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, use the rifles in our hands to defend the power of the proletariat; and more importantly, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, ensuring that the iron mountains and rivers of the proletariat remain red forever, and the brilliant communism comes early.

    坚决响应毛主席伟大号召，百分之百地支持无产阶级革命派夺权
    新华社太原十六日电　在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的革命风暴中，中国人民解放军山西省军区部队指战员，牢记毛主席关于革命的根本问题是政权问题和全心全意为人民服务的教导，在革命左派实行夺权的关键时刻，挺身而出，不畏险阻，全力支持和援助山西无产阶级革命造反派的夺权斗争，为社会主义革命事业创立了新功。这是他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的结果。这里介绍的，是山西省军区某部三连指战员写的在支持革命造反派夺权斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的体会。
    头可断，血可流，革命政权不可丢
    班长　卫泽民
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”在支援山西省革命左派夺权的斗争中，我学习了毛主席的这一教导，更加深刻地体会到：有了政权就有了一切，丧失政权就丧失一切。无产阶级必须把政权牢牢地掌握在自己手里，只有这样，才能将革命进行到底，完成光辉灿烂的社会主义、共产主义事业。
    解放前，国家机器完全掌握在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人手中。他们对广大劳动人民实行残酷的压迫和剥削。我父亲半辈子给地主、资本家当牛作马，可是连穿衣、吃饭、说话的权利都没有，最后还落得妻离子散，家破人亡。在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，劳动人民起来闹革命，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，从反动派手里夺取了政权，劳动人民从此成了国家的主人。
    阶级敌人是不甘心死亡的。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”事实正是这样。解放十七年来，山西省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把持了山西省的党、政、财、文等大权，对抗毛主席和党中央，实行资产阶级专政，把山西变成修正主义的独立王国。在文化大革命中，他们又公然反对毛主席的革命路线，篡改党中央的政策，扭转斗争的大方向，挑动群众斗群众，把给他们提意见的干部、学生、工人，打成“野心家”、“伸手派”，并扬言要“秋后算帐”；他们靠着篡夺了的经济大权，抛出反革命经济主义的破烂，对抗毛主席亲自提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，破坏无产阶级文化大革命；他们还利用把持的前《山西日报》，发表了一系列反动的社论，极力抹煞阶级斗争，蒙骗和愚弄革命群众。他们为什么能这样胡作非为？归根结蒂就是因为他们手里还掌握大权。
    现在，山西革命群众，革命领导干部，在人民解放军的全力支持下，夺了省市委等单位被一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持的一切大权，这个革命行动好得很，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！毛主席号召我们：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，要用自己的生命来保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫无产阶级的政权。头可断，血可流，无产阶级的革命政权不能丢！如果一小撮走资本主义道路当权派胆敢向无产阶级革命派进行反扑，我们就用手中的枪杆子对他们坚决实行镇压。
    支持革命左派夺权，是最重要的为人民服务
    五好战士　翟海生
    我们坚决响应最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。在支援山西无产阶级革命派夺权的斗争中，我们又一次学习了毛主席的教导：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”使我们深深懂得，无产阶级革命造反派起来夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，保证我们国家千秋万代永不变色，是无产阶级最大的政治，最根本的利益。我们积极参加和支持革命左派的夺权斗争，就是履行最最重要的政治职责，就是最大的为人民服务。我们全连同志提出：革命左派的要求就是命令，不管是上刀山，下火海，我们都要立即出动，全力支援。
    在山西革命造反派夺权联合行动的夜晚，革命造反派一声号令，我们部队立即出动，进行武装巡逻，坚决保卫革命造反派夺权斗争。夺权胜利以后，我们又马上组织宣传队上街宣传革命造反派的伟大胜利，宣传毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利。当一小撮别有用心的家伙，挑动不明真相的群众企图占领山西人民广播电台时，我们又挺身而出，和革命左派战斗在一起，用毛主席的指示，唤醒受蒙蔽的群众，保卫了广播电台的安全，让毛主席的声音及时传给广大革命群众。
    在斗争中，我们有一条判断是非、分清敌我的标准，这就是：谁拥护毛主席，我们就和他亲；谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚。有一次，我们在站哨，一个右派分子向我们挑衅说：“你支持谁？你们错了！”我们坚决干脆地回答：“谁拥护毛主席，谁坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，谁是真正的革命派，我们就坚决支持，永远支持。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛主席的革命路线，我们就坚决反对，坚决回击，坚决镇压！”几句话驳得那个家伙灰溜溜地逃走了。
    我们以坚决执行毛主席的命令，坚决支持革命左派夺权为最大光荣，因为这是最重要的为人民服务。今后，我们要在继续支持和保卫革命左派的夺权斗争中，更好地为人民服务。
    握紧枪杆子，保卫夺权胜利成果政治
    指导员　王泽俊
    毛主席教导我们：“新的社会制度还刚刚建立，还需要有一个巩固的时间。不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。”无产阶级革命派从走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺回来的各种大权，要牢牢地掌握、巩固下来，还要进行艰苦的工作，激烈的斗争。这是摆在一切无产阶级革命造反组织和革命派面前的光荣任务，也是人民解放军的重要责任。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”。事实正是这样，山西省一些机关、工厂、学校被夺了权的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并不甘心他们的灭亡，他们有的从公开转入“地下”，伺机进行破坏，有的在幕后继续操纵一些反革命组织，企图夺回失去的“印把子”。我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，“是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”是无产阶级专政的柱石。对于那一小撮反动家伙，我们坚定不移地遵循毛主席的教导：“实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。”他们胆敢兴风作浪，进行反革命活动，我们就毫不留情地对他们实行专政。
    我们是无产阶级的革命战士，我们时刻牢记毛主席关于“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队”的教导，抓革命，促战备，促生产，握紧手中枪，百倍提高警惕，严守战斗岗位，随时准备粉碎国内外敌人的任何阴谋破坏活动，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫无产阶级革命派夺权的胜利果实！
    千支援，万支援，
    用毛泽东思想武装革命左派是最大的支援
    五好战士　张福锁
    在支持山西广大革命左派夺权的斗争中，我们深深体会到，革命左派需要各方面的支援，但是，千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装革命左派是最大的支援。
    在这次夺权斗争中，我们连担负了守卫山西人民广播电台的任务。夺权前夕，广播电台的革命左派还处于少数，当时他们被一些别有用心的人挑动群众，围困已经二十多个小时，没有吃饭，没有喝水，没有休息。有些人扬言要冲进电台，接管电台，不准电台转播北京的声音。在这紧要关头，我们牢记着毛主席的教导：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”挺身而出，冲破重重障碍，克服种种困难，派人给被围困的革命左派送去大衣、开水、饭菜；但是更重要的是给他们送去毛泽东思想。我们把毛主席语录写成一张张卡片，送到每个同志手里。我们和他们一起，针对当时的斗争形势，同声朗读：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”读着读着，革命的战友们顿时浑身增添了无穷的力量，虽然两天没有睡觉，但人人斗志昂扬，意气风发，坚持斗争。许多人激动地说：“有伟大的毛泽东思想给我们指引方向，有解放军给我们撑腰，天大的困难我们也不怕，什么样的敌人我们也能战胜它。”播音员在极端困难的条件下，坚守岗位，坚持工作，把毛主席的声音，及时地传播给全省一千八百万人民。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想威信最高，威力最大，是最强大最有力的武器。在毛泽东思想的指引下，山西人民广播电台的革命左派终于取得了夺权斗争的胜利。
    林彪副主席指出：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”在当前伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，只要用毛泽东思想武装革命左派，武装广大革命群众，无产阶级文化大革命就一定会取得彻底的胜利。我们每一个革命战士，在这场伟大的革命斗争中，都要忠实地执行毛主席的指示，用手中的枪杆子，保卫无产阶级的印把子；更要热情地宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，保证无产阶级铁打的江山千秋万代永不变色，光辉灿烂的共产主义早日来临。
