All revolutionaries must read Chairman Mao's works. A Cuban sanitation worker loves Chinese magazines. He often cuts out pictures from Chinese magazines and pastes them on the walls of his home.

When asked why he does this, he replied, "Although they are just pictures, they reflect the reality of the Chinese people's continuous development and progress." He said, "China's development speed is astonishing. China has successfully conducted a nuclear test. All of China's achievements are due to the leadership of Chairman Mao."

He told Chinese comrades, "Not only should you study Chairman Mao's works, but we also need to study Chairman Mao's works very much. All revolutionaries must read Chairman Mao's books."

    革命者都要读毛主席的书
    一位古巴清洁工人很喜欢中国出版的画报，他常常从中国画报上剪下一幅幅的图画贴在他家里的墙上。
    有人询问他为什么要这样做，他回答说：“别看它们是图画，它们反映了中国人民不断发展和进步的现实生活。”他说：“中国的发展速度是惊人的，中国成功地进行了核试验，中国所取得的一切成就都是由于有毛主席的领导。”
    他对中国同志表示：“不但你们要学习毛主席著作，我们也非常需要学习毛主席著作，凡是革命者都要读毛主席的书。”
