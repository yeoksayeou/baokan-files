	Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters Issues Third Notice
	Call on All Revolutionary Peasants in the Province to Seize the Revolution and Promote Production
	Overthrow Economicism and Launch a Spring Ploughing Production High Tide

	New China News Agency, Taiyuan, February 9th — On February 7th, the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters issued its third notice, the full text of which is as follows:

	“Many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment.” The proletarian cultural revolution in Shanxi Province, like in other parts of the country, is developing with overwhelming force and tremendous momentum. The class struggle throughout the province has been launched with great fervor. The struggle for great alliance and great seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels has spread from the provincial capital to the prefectures, special districts, and counties. The power held by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the prefectures, special districts, and counties is being seized by the revolutionary rebels following the provincial party committee, provincial people's committee, Taiyuan municipal party committee, and municipal people's committee. Those capitalist-roaders who are about to be overthrown are crumbling, and their doom is already sealed. They are surrounded by the vast revolutionary masses and face imminent destruction.

	However, as Chairman Mao has taught us: “The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the U.S. imperialist aggression in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own.” The class enemies will inevitably fight to the death to save their failing cause. Some of them have turned to the countryside, colluding with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the countryside and with those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. They are attempting to win over and deceive people, spreading rumors and inciting chaos. They are raising the red flag to oppose the red flag, organizing counter-revolutionary organizations, instigating armed struggles, and carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. They are attacking poor and lower-middle peasants, striking at revolutionary cadres and activists who came to power during the Four Cleanups, and even seizing power from the poor and lower-middle peasants, committing counter-revolutionary acts, and imposing white terror on the poor and lower-middle peasants. To achieve their goal of sabotaging the cultural revolution, negating the achievements of the Four Cleanups, disrupting agricultural production, and destroying the collective economy of the people's communes, they are spreading the black wind of counter-revolutionary economicism, inciting and deceiving some young intellectuals and commune members to leave their production posts under the pretext of “linking up” and “reporting grievances” and rush to the cities; they are also adopting the despicable tactic of “dividing everything up and eating it all” to buy and flatter the commune members, leaving little or no public accumulation, even dividing up all the grain and cash accumulated over the years, slaughtering and selling livestock. They are selling agricultural and sideline products that should be sold to the state to the commune members to sell in the market. They are using every trick in the book to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, trying to cover up their own crimes and sneak past. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary commune members must not be deceived by this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We poor and lower-middle peasants must unite and form an absolute advantage in the vast countryside, unite the middle peasants, and join forces with revolutionary cadres to thoroughly smash the tricks and plots of the class enemies, impose proletarian dictatorship on them, and resolutely suppress their counter-revolutionary actions. The People's Liberation Army is our strong backing in implementing proletarian dictatorship in the vast countryside. Listen, you counter-revolutionary revisionists and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists: only the proletariat and poor and lower-middle peasants can rebel against you, not the other way around. In the countryside, only the poor and lower-middle peasants' cultural revolutionary committees, poor and lower-middle peasants' associations, and Red Guards with poor and lower-middle peasants' youth as the backbone can be organized; landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are not allowed to form counter-revolutionary organizations. All organizations of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must be disbanded.

	“Seize the revolution and promote production” is the highest instruction from our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We care most about the revolution and also about production. We deeply understand that only by seizing the revolution can we promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and production; only when the proletariat and poor and lower-middle peasants seize power and hold the seal can we truly promote production, consolidate the people's communes, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and ensure that our country remains forever red. We must resolutely execute Chairman Mao's great instruction without the slightest deviation. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and their offspring, must bravely stand up, carry out the cultural revolution, and carry out agricultural production. We must shoulder both burdens.

	Currently, the province has entered the busy season of spring ploughing preparation and wheat field management, and a wave of agricultural production is forming across the province. As the saying goes, “Delay planting by one day, delay harvesting by ten.” Time waits for no one. We must seize the opportunity and work diligently and solidly on spring ploughing preparation, launching a magnificent spring ploughing production high tide across the province.

	Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Agricultural production is of great significance, relating to China's socialist construction, the Third Five-Year Plan, the proletarian cultural revolution, and the lives of urban and rural people in China; it also relates to supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and supporting the liberation struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world. Whether or not to engage in production is also a reflection of the current class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have previously used production to suppress us, preventing us from carrying out the cultural revolution; now they are using the tactic of disrupting production to sabotage the cultural revolution. Therefore, focusing only on production and not on the revolution, or focusing only on the revolution and not on production, are both wrong. Whether or not to engage in production is also an important indicator of whether one is a true revolutionary or a fake revolutionary, a revolutionary in words only, and an important standard for measuring whether one has studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well. To resolutely execute Chairman Mao's great instruction of “seizing the revolution and promoting production,” we hereby issue the following notice:

	1. Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively; study the “Little Red Book,” study the “Draft Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Countryside,” and study the editorial of the third issue of “Red Flag.” In the current proletarian cultural revolution and spring ploughing production, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Take the “Three Articles” as a motto, break down the “self” and establish the “public.” Chairman Mao's great instruction of “seizing the revolution and promoting production” must be remembered and put into action. We must make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for double victories in the cultural revolution and spring ploughing production.

	2. Resolutely implement the Party's class line, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and unite the middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for seizing the revolution and promoting production in the countryside and the pillar of the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside. We must resolutely rely on them. The poor and lower-middle peasants must unite with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary students, achieve great unity, form an advantage for the revolutionary rebels in the countryside, form an advantage for the poor and lower-middle peasants, establish and improve two sets of leadership teams for leading the revolution and production, and carry out the cultural revolution and spring ploughing preparation and spring ploughing production with great fervor.

	County, commune, and brigade revolutionary cadres must take responsibility, stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fight resolutely against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At the same time, they must guard their posts and contribute their greatest efforts to the current spring ploughing production. Whether a cadre is revolutionary and loyal to Chairman Mao is an important standard for their attitude towards the cultural revolution and spring ploughing production. Cadres who have made mistakes must stand up for the revolution, expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and conduct serious self-criticism; they can make amends and redeem themselves by taking charge of spring ploughing production. If they are passive or even abandon their duties, that is adding error to error, and they will face severe punishment.

	Revolutionary students and teachers who are linking up in the countryside must actively participate in the local spring ploughing and sowing work, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of “seizing the revolution and promoting production.” This is an important manifestation of the unity between revolutionary students and the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	3. The busy season of spring ploughing in the countryside is about to begin, and various places are accelerating their spring ploughing and sowing preparations. During the spring ploughing preparations, we must seize the opportunity and make every second count. We must focus on fertilizing, preparing seeds, timely repairing agricultural tools, preparing agricultural machinery spare parts, raising livestock, and cultivating and harrowing the land. All work related to spring ploughing production must be prepared and implemented item by item. Since last autumn, there has been no snow all winter, and the soil moisture is not good. We must make preparations for drought resistance. Currently, it is the time for wheat to turn green, and we must water it in time and pay attention to preventing wheat rust. During the various spring ploughing works, we must fully carry forward the spirit of thrift in running the commune, thrift in building the country, and self-reliance, saving for the revolution, and saving for production. We must especially highlight politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to inspire the enthusiasm of the commune members.

	Arranging the lives of commune members is an important condition for seizing the revolution and promoting production. The black wind of economicism blown by the die-hard executors of the bourgeois reactionary line has destroyed the collective economy, harmed the fundamental interests of the broad masses of commune members, and affected the lives of some commune members. During the spring ploughing production, we must arrange the lives of the broad masses of commune members well, take care of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and take care of the five-guarantee households. We must solve the problem of insufficient grain for some commune members with the spirit of self-reliance. County, commune, and brigade revolutionary cadres must immediately take charge of the distribution and settlement work to solve the commune members' need for money.

	4. Be vigilant and prevent the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists from carrying out sabotage activities. Smash economicism in the countryside and smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Collective production tools and production funds must be used for production and not for living. Collective property must not be tampered with, and collective livestock must not be slaughtered or sold. Oppose the wrong practice of dividing everything up and eating it all, leaving little or no accumulation. Rural youth who are linking up outside must return to their original production brigades to participate in agricultural production. All agricultural labor force must not leave their production posts at will. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are the objects of dictatorship and must not be allowed to cause trouble. If they cause trouble, disrupt spring ploughing, disrupt production, and disrupt the cultural revolution, they must be suppressed and punished according to law.

	5. All poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary rebels must spare no effort to shoulder the glorious responsibility of carrying out spring ploughing and sowing well. No matter who it is, if they obstruct spring ploughing and sowing, they must be seriously dealt with.

	Spring ploughing production is an urgent matter. We call on all poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and all revolutionary rebel fighters to, for the common revolutionary goal, fulfill the above five requirements. We demand that all levels of agricultural, forestry, financial, commercial, supply and marketing, and other departments related to agricultural production take immediate action to support agricultural production without missing the agricultural time, providing necessary funds, technology, materials, tools, and pesticides for spring ploughing and sowing. All revolutionaries must unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of “seizing the revolution and promoting production,” achieve a great harvest in agriculture this year, and achieve double victories in revolution and production!

	Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great call of “seizing the revolution and promoting production,” and carry out spring ploughing and sowing work well!

	All poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and the People's Liberation Army must unite, seize the revolution, promote production, and launch a new high tide of spring ploughing production!

	Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!

	Resolutely overthrow counter-revolutionary economicism!

	We will certainly carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

	Long live proletarian dictatorship!

	Long live the invincible and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    山西革命造反总指挥部发出第三号通告
    号召全省革命农民抓革命促生产
    打倒经济主义掀起春耕生产高潮
    新华社太原九日电山西革命造反总指挥部二月七日发出第三号通告，全文如下：
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”山西省的无产阶级文化大革命，同全国各地一样，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，迅猛异常地向前发展。全省全面的阶级斗争已经轰轰烈烈地展开。革命造反派大联合、大夺权的斗争已经由省城发展到地、专、县。地、专、县的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所把持的权力，继前省委、省人委、太原市委、市人委之后，也正在被革命造反派夺了过来，那些即将被打倒的走资本主义道路的当权派土崩瓦解之势已经注定，他们已处在广大革命群众包围的汪洋大海之中，面临灭顶之灾。
    但是，正如毛主席所教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”阶级敌人必然要和我们作拚死的斗争，来挽救他们失败的命运。他们当中的一些人转向农村，和农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和那些没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子串通一气，招降纳叛，造谣惑众，打着“红旗”反红旗，组织反革命的反动组织，挑起武斗，进行反革命复辟活动。他们围攻贫下中农，打击四清运动中上台的革命干部和积极分子，他们甚至夺了贫下中农的权，造了无产阶级的反，对贫下中农实行白色恐怖。为了达到破坏文化大革命，否定四清成果，破坏农业生产，破坏人民公社集体经济的目的，他们大刮反革命经济主义的黑风，煽动和蛊惑一些知识青年和社员，以“串连”和“告状”为名，脱离生产岗位，涌向城市；他们为了收买和讨好社员，还采取了“分净吃光”的卑鄙手段，不留或少留公共积累，甚至把历年积累的粮食和现金统统分光，把耕畜杀掉分吃或贩卖；他们把农村中作为商品的农副业产品，不向国家出售，而分给社员拿到市场出售。他们耍尽种种花招，腐蚀群众的革命斗志，企图把他们自己的罪恶掩盖起来，蒙混过关。贫下中农和革命的社员千万不要上这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的当。我们贫下中农要联合起来，在广大农村中形成贫下中农的绝对优势，团结中农，联合革命干部，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，对他们实行无产阶级专政，坚决镇压他们的反革命行动。人民解放军是我们在广大农村实行无产阶级专政的坚强后盾。那些反革命修正主义分子和地、富、反、坏、右分子听着：只许无产阶级、贫下中农造你们的反，不许你们造贫下中农的反。在农村中只准组织贫下中农文化革命委员会、贫下中农协会和以贫下中农青年为骨干的红卫兵；不准地、富、反、坏、右搞反革命组织。地、富、反、坏、右分子的组织一律解散。
    “抓革命，促生产”，这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席向我们发出的最高指示。我们广大的贫下中农最听毛主席的话，我们最关心革命，也最关心生产。我们深深懂得，只有抓好革命，才能促进人的思想革命化，才能搞好生产；只有无产阶级、贫下中农夺了权、掌了印，才能真正抓好生产，才能巩固人民公社，才能巩固无产阶级专政，才能保证我们国家永远保持鲜红的颜色。对毛主席的伟大指示，我们要坚决执行，不折不扣地照办。我们贫下中农和贫下中农的子弟要勇敢地站出来，搞好文化大革命，搞好农业生产。要把两副重担一肩挑。
    当前全省已进入了春耕备耕、麦田管理的大忙季节，一个农业生产的热潮正在全省形成。俗话说，迟种一天，晚收十天。节令不饶人。机不可失，时不再来。我们一定要用“只争朝夕”的精神，不失时机地、扎扎实实地抓好春耕备耕工作，在全省掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产热潮。
    农业是国民经济的基础。农业生产关系重大，关系到我国的社会主义建设，关系到第三个五年计划，关系到无产阶级文化大革命，关系到我国城乡人民的生活；同时也关系到支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，关系到支援世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放斗争。搞不搞生产，这也是当前阶级斗争、两条道路斗争的反映。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派过去用生产压我们，不让我们搞文化大革命；现在他们又用破坏生产的手段，企图破坏文化大革命。所以，只抓生产，不抓革命，和只抓革命，不抓生产，都是错误的。搞不搞生产，这也是衡量是真革命，还是假革命、口头革命的重要标志，也是衡量毛主席著作学得好不好，用得好不好的重要标准。为了坚决执行毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，我们特发表通告如下：
    一、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作；学习《毛主席语录》，学习《中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）》，学习《红旗》第三期社论。在当前的无产阶级文化大革命和春耕生产中，按照毛主席的指示办事。把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，我们要记在脑子里，落实到行动上，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取文化大革命和春耕生产双胜利。
    二、坚决贯彻执行党的阶级路线，依靠贫下中农，团结中农。贫下中农是农村抓革命、促生产的主力军，是农村无产阶级文化大革命的支柱，必须坚决依靠他们。贫下中农要和革命的干部结合起来，同革命的学生结合起来，实行大联合，在农村中形成革命造反派的优势，形成贫下中农的优势，建立和健全领导革命和生产的两套班子，把文化革命和春耕准备、春耕生产热火朝天地搞起来。
    县、社、队的革命干部，要负起责任来，要站在毛主席的革命路线一边，和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行坚决斗争，同时要坚守岗位，为当前的春耕生产贡献最大的力量。每一个干部是否革命，是否忠于毛主席，对待文化大革命和春耕生产的态度是一条重要的标准。有错误的干部，要站起来革命，要揭发和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的罪行，要认真检讨；抓好春耕生产，可以将功补过，立功赎罪。如果消极怠工或者竟至撒手不管，躺倒不干，那就是错上加错，就要受到严厉处分。
    在农村串连的革命师生，一定要积极参加当地的春耕春播工作，同广大贫下中农一起贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，这是革命师生和贫下中农相结合的重要表现。
    三、农村春耕大忙季节即将开始，各地正在加紧春耕春播的准备工作。在春耕准备当中，一定要抓紧时机，分秒必争。要抓好积肥，备好种子，及时修理农具，准备好农机备品备件，喂养好牲畜，要整修、耙耱土地，凡与春耕生产有关的工作都要一项一项地准备好，一项一项地落实。去秋以来，一冬无雪，墒情不好，要作好抗旱防旱准备工作。当前正是小麦返青的时候，要及时浇灌，要注意防止小麦锈病。在进行各项春耕工作时，要大力发扬勤俭办社、勤俭建国、自力更生的精神，节约闹革命，节约闹生产。尤其要突出政治，用毛泽东思想激发社员群众的积极性。
    安排好社员生活是抓革命促生产的一个重要条件。资产阶级反动路线顽固执行者刮起的经济主义黑风，破坏了集体经济，损害了广大社员的根本利益，影响了一部分社员的生活。在春耕生产当中，我们要把广大社员群众的生活安排好，要照顾好烈军属、五保户，要以自力更生的精神解决好一部分社员口粮不足的困难，县、社、队的革命干部要立即抓好分配兑现工作，解决社员花钱的需要。
    四、提高警惕，防止党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子进行破坏活动。粉碎农村中的经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。集体的生产资料、生产资金必须用于生产，不能用于生活。集体财物绝不能乱动，集体的耕畜绝不能乱宰乱卖，反对分净吃光、少留不留积累的错误做法。外出串连的农村青年都要回到原生产大队参加农业生产，所有农业劳动力都不得随意离开生产岗位。地、富、反、坏、右分子是专政的对象，绝不许他们乱说乱动，如果乱说乱动，破坏春耕，破坏生产，破坏文化革命，就坚决镇压，依法惩办。
    五、广大贫下中农、革命造反派，都要全力以赴，担负起搞好春耕春播的光荣责任。不管是谁，只要妨碍春耕春播，都要严肃处理。
    春耕生产是当务之急。我们号召广大贫下中农、革命农民和革命工人、革命学生、革命干部、一切革命造反派战士，为了共同的革命目标，做到上述五点要求。我们要求各级农林、财贸、供销等和农业生产有关的部门，积极行动起来，不误农时地支援农业生产，为春耕春播提供必要的资金、技术、物资、农具、农药。所有的革命者在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，夺取今年农业大丰收，夺取革命、生产双胜利！
    坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，搞好春耕春播工作！
    广大贫下中农、革命工人、革命学生、革命干部和人民解放军联合起来，抓革命，促生产，掀起春耕生产新高潮！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    坚决打倒反革命经济主义！
    誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    战无不胜的光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                        山西革命造反总指挥部
                            一九六七年二月七日
