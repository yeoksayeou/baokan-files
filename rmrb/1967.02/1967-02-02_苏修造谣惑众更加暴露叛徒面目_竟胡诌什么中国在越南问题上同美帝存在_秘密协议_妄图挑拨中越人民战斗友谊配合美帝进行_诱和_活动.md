The Soviet revisionist leaders, a bunch of scoundrels, in collusion with the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" plot, recently, in tandem with the Washington ruling clique and the Indian reactionaries, once again fabricated and spread the infamous lies of so-called "secret agreements" and "understandings" between China and the U.S. on the Vietnam issue. They maliciously slander the steadfast stance of the Chinese people in resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. They attempt to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, disrupt the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and betray the interests of the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionist leaders, as the chief accomplices and faithful lackeys of U.S. imperialism, instructed the Soviet News Agency on January 20 to publish a news bulletin in Tanzania. In the bulletin, they quoted lies from the Paris Daily and the Washington Post, fabricating that China and the U.S. have some "secret agreements" and "understandings" on the Vietnam issue. According to this non-existent "secret agreement" and "understanding," China will "not take any direct military actions in Vietnam" and will "not allow any military actions on its territory that could provoke a U.S. attack on China." The U.S. will undertake the obligation not to launch a military attack on China. The Soviet News Agency also seriously claimed that China had sent a letter to the U.S. through Paris last year, discussing the conditions for not participating in the Vietnam War, and that from the public speeches of U.S. President Johnson and other high-ranking U.S. officials, the U.S. had "agreed to these conditions."

Coincidentally, while the Soviet revisionists were spreading these slanders against China, the U.S. ruling clique and the Indian reactionaries also spread similar fairy tales about the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. According to a report by the New York Times on the 18th, U.S. officials recently fabricated that there was an "understanding" between China and the U.S. regarding China's non-participation in the Vietnam War. They claimed that during the Warsaw talks, China had expressed that if the U.S. did not attack them (China) or invade North Vietnam, China would not interfere in the Vietnam War. The Indian reactionaries' mouthpiece, the Indian Times, also parroted this, reporting from Washington on January 24 that the U.S. had "indirectly obtained" such a "guarantee" from Beijing through the Warsaw talks: if the U.S. did not intend to overthrow the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam or invade North Vietnam, and did not intend to get involved in trouble with China, then China would also not intervene directly. Washington, Moscow, and New Delhi, at the same time, fabricated and propagated the same content of lies about the same issue, clearly indicating that the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, these three brothers-in-arms, had conspired and coordinated with each other to create this monstrous lie.

The Soviet revisionist leaders, together with U.S. imperialism and the Indian reactionaries, fabricating these slanders against China is not accidental. Since the first half of last year, these shameless scoundrels have repeatedly, in collusion with the U.S., spread rumors to mislead the people, fabricating that China had made "political deals" with the U.S. on the Vietnam issue during the Warsaw talks. This year, the Soviet Union and the U.S. have further intensified their collusion and coordination on the Vietnam issue and, together with some reactionary countries, have spared no effort to intensify their despicable activities of "pressuring for peace," "luring for peace," and "persuading for peace." Under these circumstances, they fabricated this absurd rumor, merely to divert people's attention, help the U.S. peddle its new "peace talks" deception, and cover up their shameful collusion with U.S. imperialism to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, have already made up their minds to make any national sacrifice, resolutely and unshakably support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnamese territory. The Chinese government and leaders have repeatedly solemnly declared that regardless of what the U.S. imperialists do, China will continue, based on the interests of the Vietnamese people and the requirements of the Vietnamese people, to take all necessary actions at any time to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people until final victory.

The proletarian internationalist principle of the Chinese people supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is unshakable, and the fraternal unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples is unbreakable. No matter how many absurd rumors the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys fabricate, they are all in vain and cannot save their doomed fate.

    苏修造谣惑众更加暴露叛徒面目
    竟胡诌什么中国在越南问题上同美帝存在“秘密协议”
    妄图挑拨中越人民战斗友谊配合美帝进行“诱和”活动
    新华社三十一日讯  本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团的混蛋们，配合美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋，最近竟然同华盛顿统治集团和印度反动派相呼应，再次制造和散布所谓中国在越南问题上同美国存在什么“秘密协议”和“默契”的无耻谎言，妄图诽谤中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的严正立场，挑拨中越人民的战斗友谊，破坏英雄越南人民的抗美救国斗争，出卖越南人民的利益。美帝国主义的头号帮凶和忠实走卒苏联修正主义领导集团，授命苏联新闻社一月二十日在坦桑尼亚出版新闻公报，在新闻公报中援引《巴黎日报》和美国《华盛顿邮报》编造的谎言，造谣说，中国在越南问题上同美国存在什么“秘密协议”和“默契”。据说，根据这个根本不存在的“秘密协议”和“默契”，中国将“不在越南采取任何直接的军事行动，而且将不允许在它的领土上发生任何足以引起美国对华进攻的军事行动。美国则承担义务不对中国发动军事攻击”。苏联新闻社还煞有介事地胡说什么中国在“去年通过巴黎交给美国一封信，信中谈了不参加越南战争的条件”，而从美国“约翰逊总统与其他（美国）高级官员的公开讲话看，美国‘已同意了这些条件’”。
    无独有偶的是，在苏联修正主义者散布这种诬蔑中国的谎言的同时，美国统治集团和印度反动派也就中美大使级华沙会谈传出了这类天方夜谭式的神话。据《纽约时报》十八日报道，美国官员最近胡诌什么中美之间有关于中国不参加越南战争的“默契”，胡说在华沙会谈中，中国曾表示“如果美国不进攻他们（中国）或入侵北越”，中国“将不干涉越南战争”。印度反动派的喉舌《印度时报》也鹦鹉学舌，在一月二十四日刊载的发自华盛顿的消息中，胡说什么美国通过华沙会谈“间接地从北京得到”了这样的“保证”：如果美国“不打算打垮”越南民主共和国政府或“入侵北越”，“不打算卷入同中国的麻烦”，“中国也将不进行直接干预”。华盛顿、莫斯科、新德里在同一个时候，就同一个问题，编造和宣扬同一内容的谎言，这就清楚地表明，帝、修、反这三家难兄难弟所制造的弥天大谎，是蓄谋的，是彼此配合好了的。
    苏联修正主义领导集团现在同美帝国主义和印度反动派一起编造这些诬蔑中国的胡言乱语，绝不是偶然的。早从去年上半年以来，苏修这帮无耻之徒就曾经多次配合美国在越南问题上的和谈骗局，以谣言惑众，胡说中国在华沙会谈中同美国就越南问题进行“政治交易”。今年以来，苏美在越南问题上进一步加紧勾结，密切配合，并且联合一些国家的反动派，千方百计地加紧对越南进行“压和”、“诱和”、“劝和”的卑鄙活动。在这种情况下，它们又制造这种荒唐无稽的谣言，无非是为了转移人们的视线，帮助美国推销新的“和谈”骗局，掩盖他们联合美帝国主义扼杀越南人民抗美救国斗争的可耻勾当。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，早就下定决心，不怕任何民族牺牲，坚决地、毫不动摇地支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者赶出越南领土。中国政府和中国领导人曾一再严正声明，不管美帝国主义怎么办，中国将继续根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取一切必要的行动，支援越南人民的伟大斗争，直到最后胜利。
    中国人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的无产阶级国际主义原则立场是坚定不移的，兄弟的中越人民的战斗团结是牢不可破的。不管美帝、苏修及其走卒编造多少混蛋透顶的谣言，都是枉费心机的，都无法挽救失败的命运。
