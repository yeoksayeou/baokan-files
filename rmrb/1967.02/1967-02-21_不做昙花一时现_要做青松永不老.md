In the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, countless daring, revolutionary, and rebellious heroes have emerged. They are the vanguards of rebellion, the revolutionary pioneers who break through all obstacles, truly embodying the spirit of "Heroes of the age, look to the present!"

The wheels of history roll forward, and the revolutionary tide surges. Those who have achieved some success in the revolutionary rebellion must remain humble and steadfast, always pressing forward, and revolutionizing to the end!

We will not be transient figures in history, passing by in a day and staying for a night, gone in a flash.

We will not be the ephemeral moonflower, though it is vibrant and pleasing to the eye, it withers and dies in an instant.

We will not be the fleeting steel sparks, though they are bright and dazzling, drawing attention, but once cooled, they are merely dull iron slag.

Revolutionary rebel comrades, we must be like the evergreen pines on the red cliffs. They stand tall and strong, unyielding and resilient.

Whether it is wind or rain, snow or ice, they stand firm and evergreen.

Whether it is spring or autumn, winter or summer, they reach for the sky, forever green as jade.

Revolutionary rebels must be like the evergreen pine, forever young in revolution!

We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. If this step is worth being proud of, it is a small matter. What is more worth being proud of is still ahead. ... The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and must continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle."

Chairman Mao's words are shining and brilliant. We rebels, after reading them, are enlightened and full of vigor. Let us forever follow Chairman Mao, bravely advancing through storms and waves!

Forever be the proud and tall evergreen pine, never the fleeting moonflower!

Carry the revolution through to the end!

    不做昙花一时现  要做青松永不老
    在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，涌现出了无数敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的勇士。他们是造反的急先锋，是冲破一切罗网的革命闯将，真是“数风流人物，还看今朝”！
    时代的车轮隆隆向前，革命的潮流波涛汹涌。那些取得一定成绩的革命造反者，一定要戒骄戒躁，永远向前，革命到底！
    我们不做历史上匆匆而过的过客，走一天，住一宿，一晃而过。
    我们不做那瞬息一现的昙花，虽然鲜艳、悦目，但在转瞬间就雕零枯萎了。
    我们不做那砰然四溅的钢花，虽然明亮、耀眼，引人注目，但它冷却以后，只不过是黯然无光的铁渣。
    革命造反派的战友们，我们要做那红岩绝壁上的青松。它是那样的挺拔，茁壮，威武不屈。
    无论是风是雨，是雪是冰，它永远巍然屹立，永远郁郁苍苍。
    无论是春是秋，是冬是夏，它永远高耸入云，永远青如碧霞。…………
    革命造反派要象青松那样永葆革命的青春！
    我们要时时刻刻牢记毛主席的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。如果这一步也值得骄傲，那是比较渺小的，更值得骄傲的还在后头。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    毛主席的话，字字句句，金光闪闪，我们造反者读了，心明眼亮，干劲倍长。让我们永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中奋勇前进！
    永做那傲然挺拔的青松，绝不做那瞬息一现的昙花！
    将革命进行到底！
