Guinean people trust the experts sent by Chairman Mao

	NEW DELHI, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Guinean President Sekou Touré received Chinese agricultural experts at his residence on the evening of the 17th and had a cordial and friendly conversation with them. Present at the reception were Guinean State Minister Diallo Seforaie, Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui, Economic Development Minister Ismail Touré, Rural Economy Minister Keta Fodeba, National Education Minister Sedou Gonté, and other senior officials.

	President Touré told the Chinese agricultural experts, "We trust you and your country." He expressed satisfaction with the work done by the Chinese agricultural experts in Guinea over the past four months and thanked them for their efforts in developing Guinea's agriculture.

	President Touré said, "Guinea's agriculture does not need large-scale technical measures because our farmers are not yet at that level. We need small-scale technical measures that suit our farmers' level and improve agricultural production efficiency. China has rich experience in agricultural development, and we hope you can find methods in Guinea that are suitable for developing our agriculture and adapt to our people and rural natural conditions."

	President Touré emphasized that Guinea is determined to achieve self-sufficiency through the strength of its own people.

	The Chinese Agricultural Research Team arrived in Guinea in September last year at the invitation of the Guinean government. Upon arrival, they immediately began their research work and, together with Guinean workers, reclaimed about 30 acres of land, planted several varieties of rice, and also tried planting wheat, corn, millet, peanuts, and more than ten kinds of vegetables. These crops are now growing well. Over a thousand kilograms of vegetables, including tomatoes, cabbage, eggplants, and peppers, have already been harvested. Over the past four months, the Chinese agricultural experts, despite the scorching heat, worked in the fields day and night, on weekends and holidays, just like ordinary farmers. The Chinese agricultural experts' strong sense of responsibility and hardworking spirit have earned them the praise of their Guinean friends. They said, "The Chinese agricultural experts are our true friends. They came to Guinea to help us. They are good experts sent by Chairman Mao Zedong."

    杜尔总统感谢我专家为发展几内亚农业作出的努力 
    几内亚人民信赖毛主席派来的专家
    新华社科纳克里电  几内亚总统塞古·杜尔十七日晚上在他的住所接见了中国农业研究小组的一些农业专家，并同他们进行了亲切友好的谈话。接见时在座的有几内亚国务部长迪亚洛·塞福拉耶，外交部长朗萨纳·贝阿沃吉，经济发展部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔，农村经济部长凯塔·福代巴，国民教育部长塞杜·贡特和其他高级官员。
    杜尔总统对中国农业专家说：“我们信赖你们和你们的国家。”他对中国农业专家到几内亚来的四个多月的工作表示满意，对他们为发展几内亚的农业所作的努力表示感谢。
    杜尔总统说：“几内亚的农业不需要大型技术措施，因为目前我国农民还不能达到这个水平。我们需要适应我国农民水平、提高农业生产效率的小型技术措施。中国在发展农业方面具有丰富的经验，我们希望你们在几内亚能找到为发展我国农业、适合我国人民的和农村自然条件的方法。”
    杜尔总统着重指出，几内亚决心依靠几内亚人民的力量达到自给自足。
    中国农业研究小组是在去年九月应几内亚政府的邀请来到几内亚的。他们到几内亚后马上就开始研究工作，同几内亚工人一起，开垦了约三十亩土地，试种了好几种稻子，还试种了小麦、玉米、小米、花生和十多种蔬菜。这些作物现在生长良好。已经收获一千多公斤的蔬菜，其中有西红柿、白菜、茄子、辣椒等。在四个多月中，中国农业专家冒着酷热，不论白天黑夜、星期天或节日，都象一个普通的农民一样在地里工作。中国农业专家对工作的高度责任感和苦干精神获得了几内亚朋友的赞扬。他们说：“中国的农业专家是我们的真正朋友，他们到几内亚是真正来帮助我们的，他们是毛泽东主席派来的好专家。”
