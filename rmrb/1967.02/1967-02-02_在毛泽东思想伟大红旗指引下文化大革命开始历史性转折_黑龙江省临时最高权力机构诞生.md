Under the banner of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the Cultural Revolution begins a historic turn. The temporary highest authority of Heilongjiang Province is born.

On February 1, 100,000 Red Guards and soldiers from the stationed military units held a grand rally for the great alliance and seizure of power in Harbin. They solemnly declared that all power of the original Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee belongs to the Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards, and urgently called on the revolutionary people of the entire province to resolutely seize the revolution and promote production.

Organizing tens of thousands of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries. Mao Zedong

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 1: On January 31, 100,000 Red Guards and soldiers from the stationed military units in Heilongjiang Province held a grand rally for the great alliance and seizure of power in Harbin. They formally announced the establishment of the temporary highest authority of Heilongjiang Province—the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards.

The birth of the temporary highest authority of Heilongjiang Province marks a great historic turn in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Heilongjiang Province. The newly established Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards was formed after thorough preparation and consultation by the leaders of the Red Guard alliance headquarters, the leaders of the provincial military region, and the main leaders of the Provincial Party Committee who carried out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

At the rally, the first "Notice" and the "Appeal" on seizing the revolution and promoting production were solemnly read. The "Notice" solemnly declared that from the establishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards, all power of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee in terms of party, government, finance, and culture belongs to the Revolutionary Committee, and the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee immediately ceases. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee leads and firmly supports all genuine proletarian revolutionary factions in the province to unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and seize power from the capitalist roaders within the party and the diehard elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line in their localities.

The "Appeal" calls on the revolutionary workers, peasants, commercial and financial employees, and revolutionary masses of the entire province to take immediate action, resolutely, thoroughly, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and launch a fierce attack on counter-revolutionary economism. They are called upon to bravely shoulder the double burden of revolution and production.

The various revolutionary armies and fully armed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the rally, holding high red flags and carrying portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, were spirited and vigorous. From early in the morning, they beat drums and gongs, surging towards the venue.

The rally opened solemnly to the song "The East Is Red." When the Red Guards solemnly announced the formal establishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards in the opening speech, the venue immediately erupted in enthusiastic and prolonged cheers: "Long live the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!" "Long live, long live, long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!"

At the rally, representatives of the revolutionary rebels from the workers, peasants, and students spoke one after another. In their speeches, they enthusiastically hailed the establishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards and pledged to fight for the complete victory of the proletarian seizure of power. They particularly emphasized that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Today, we, the Red Guards of Heilongjiang Province, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have united to seize power and taken the power that the capitalist roaders within the party have long occupied in Heilongjiang Province into the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a new achievement of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! We will let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, which shines with boundless brilliance, fly high and forever in the sky of Heilongjiang Province!

The First Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Song Renqiong, the former First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, Pan Fusheng, and the Commander of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, Wang Jiadao, and the responsible person of a certain unit of the stationed troops, You Haoyang, attended the rally and spoke.

Song Renqiong, on behalf of the Northeast Bureau Secretariat, extended the warmest congratulations and the most resolute support to the rally! He expressed his determination to fight alongside the Red Guards to achieve the combat tasks proposed by the rally! He said: I have made a line error, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao, I will resolutely correct my past mistakes, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely stand and fight alongside the revolutionary rebels, and achieve victory together.

Pan Fusheng, in his speech, expressed his determination to fight alongside the Red Guards and seize power from the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the diehard elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. He said: We have seized this power correctly and well! He warmly congratulated the birth of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards.

Wang Jiadao and You Haoyang, on behalf of the provincial military region and the broad masses of soldiers from the stationed troops, extended the warmest congratulations and the most resolute support to the rally. They expressed that at this critical moment of seizing power, the People's Liberation Army will resolutely respond to the great battle call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao, actively support the broad leftist masses. They said: Comrades of the Red Guards, go ahead and rebel against the old bosses of the bourgeoisie, we will firmly support you, be your strong rear guard, resolutely take dictatorial measures against counter-revolutionary organizations and counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely defend the Cultural Revolution.

The rally received enthusiastic support from revolutionary rebels across the province and the country. The liaison station of the Third Command of the Red Guards in Beijing also sent a representative to attend the rally and spoke at the rally. The rally also received congratulatory telegrams and letters from many revolutionary organizations across the country.

The rally, amidst the enthusiastic applause and cheers of the entire audience, passed a telegram of respect to our great leader Chairman Mao.

The rally concluded with a grand parade and demonstration. The fully armed People's Liberation Army of China marched at the forefront of the parade, displaying the firm will and determination of the People's Liberation Army to resolutely support the revolutionary leftists. The grand parade and demonstration showed: The greatest festival of the Red Guards has arrived! The funeral bells of all ghosts and monsters have rung!

    《呼吁书》号召全省革命的工人、农民、财贸职工和革命群众紧急行动起来，坚决地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，向反革命的经济主义猛烈开火，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。

    中共中央东北局第一书记宋任穷，原中共黑龙江省委第一书记潘复生和黑龙江省军区司令员汪家道，驻军某部负责人游好扬，参加了这次大会，并讲了话。

    潘复生在讲话中表示要坚决地同红色造反者战斗在一起，要把大权从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手中夺过来。他说：我们这个权夺得对，夺得好，好得很！他热烈祝贺黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会的诞生。
    汪家道和游好扬代表省军区和驻军广大指战员向大会表示最热烈的祝贺和最坚决的支持。他们表示，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，人民解放军要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席发出的伟大战斗号召，积极支持左派广大群众。他们说：红色造反者战友们，你们大造资产阶级老爷们的反吧，我们坚决支持你们，誓作你们的坚强后盾，坚决对反革命组织和反革命分子采取专政措施，坚决保卫文化大革命。
