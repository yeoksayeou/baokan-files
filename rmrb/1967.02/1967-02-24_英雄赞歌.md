I was deeply moved after reading the book *Lei Feng*. Tears streamed down my face. This outstanding revolutionary soldier has ignited a socialist passion within me. I cannot remain indifferent. I must do something.

The poetic line "One must approach work with the fervor of summer" has awakened me from my slumber. Now I understand: "A person's life is limited, but serving the people is limitless. I will dedicate my limited life to the boundless service of the people."

The exemplary Chinese youth was mainly inspired by the works of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's teachings instilled in Lei Feng a burning desire to serve the motherland and, if necessary, to die for the motherland. I now resolve to follow in the footsteps of Comrade Lei Feng.

I was deeply moved by an article about the revolutionary soldier Wang Jie published in a Chinese magazine. This article has greatly educated me. As he wrote in his diary, "Why does a person live? How should one live?" This has given me much enlightenment. I resolve to follow his example and become a true revolutionary.

The revolutionary spirit of Cai Yongxiang deeply moved me. The Chinese heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong's thought have deeply moved me. Cai Yongxiang's selfless, dedicated revolutionary spirit has deeply moved me and will forever inspire me. The new generation of Chinese heroes has helped me understand how to be a person beneficial to the people.

    英雄赞歌
    决心踏着雷锋同志的足迹前进
    看了《雷锋》一书，泪水从我的面颊上流下来。这位优秀的革命战士在我身上激起了社会主义的激情。我不能无动于衷。我必须有所作为。
    “对待工作要象夏天一样的火热。”这诗一般的句子把我从沉睡中唤醒。现在我也认识到：“人的生命是有限的，可是，为人民服务是无限的，我要把有限的生命，投入到无限的‘为人民服务’之中去”。
    这位中国青年的优秀的榜样主要是读了毛泽东的著作。毛泽东的教导在雷锋的心灵中灌注了为祖国服务和必要时为祖国而死的炽烈的愿望。我现在决心跟随着雷锋同志的足迹前进。

    以王杰为榜样做真正的革命者
    中国杂志上刊载的一篇关于革命战士王杰的文章，使我十分感动。这篇文章深深教育了我。正如他在日记中所写的“一个人为什么活着？怎样生活？”这对我有很大的启发。我决心遵循他的榜样做一个真正的革命者。

    蔡永祥的革命精神深深感动我
    毛泽东思想哺育出来的中国英雄人物使我深受感动。蔡永祥的毫不利己、专门利人的革命精神深深感动了我，并永远给我以鼓舞。中国新的一代的英雄人物，帮助我懂得怎样做一个有益于人民的人。　锡兰　瓦特纳
