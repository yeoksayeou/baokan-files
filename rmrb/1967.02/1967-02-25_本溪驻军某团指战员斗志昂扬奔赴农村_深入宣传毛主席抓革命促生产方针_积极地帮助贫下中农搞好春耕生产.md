Soldiers of a Certain Regiment in Benxi March to the Countryside with High Spirits
Actively Propagate Chairman Mao's Policy of Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production
Actively Help Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants with Spring Ploughing

The People's Daily reports: The soldiers of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Benxi City, Liaoning Province, have recently actively gone deep into the local agricultural production teams. On the one hand, they propagate Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" to the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres. On the other hand, they directly participate in the intense spring ploughing labor with the community members.

The party committee of this regiment believes: The spring ploughing busy season is approaching, and it is the glorious duty of all cadres and soldiers in the regiment to strongly support and help with the local spring ploughing production work. Even during the Spring Festival, the cadres and soldiers, carrying the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," holding up Mao's quotation boards, and waving red flags, drumming and gonging, marched to eleven production teams with high spirits. Upon arriving at the production teams, they first seized the time to widely propagate Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" to the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres on the kang (bed platform) and in the fields. At the same time, they participated in labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, stepping on the ice and snow to engage in tasks such as spreading manure, delivering manure, and preparing the land. The model actions of the PLA greatly inspired the community members. They said: "The PLA not only supports our production but also brings us Chairman Mao's instructions. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production' to seize the revolution and promote production during the spring ploughing busy season. We will be both revolutionaries and production vanguards, achieving a double harvest of revolution and production in 1967, and excellently completing the glorious tasks given to us by Chairman Mao."

In the new situation of the deepening Cultural Revolution, the production leadership team of the 10th Production Team of Beigou Brigade is not complete. The regiment's headquarters cadres brought Chairman Mao's works here. Through studying Chairman Mao's works and holding heart-to-heart talks with the team cadres, they helped the cadres raise their awareness and dare to take on responsibilities for the revolution; at the same time, they propagated Chairman Mao's cadre policy to the community members, quickly restoring the revolutionary and production leadership team of this team. Some cadres of Xigou Brigade made some mistakes during the Cultural Revolution, and the community members posted big-character posters on them, causing them to have mental burdens. Deputy Commander Tian Fengjiu of the 4th Company studied Chairman Mao's teachings on putting down burdens and starting the machine, as well as the editorial "Responding to Chairman Mao's Call, Going Among the Masses" from the Red Flag magazine with these cadres, helping them eliminate their worries, remove the "fear" character, and establish the "dare" character. With Tian Fengjiu's enthusiastic help, the cadres who made general mistakes quickly raised their awareness and bravely stepped forward to take on responsibilities. They sincerely stated: They must dare to lead the masses to take on the spring ploughing production work, establishing new merits for the Cultural Revolution and achieving a great agricultural harvest this year.

    本溪驻军某团指战员斗志昂扬奔赴农村
    深入宣传毛主席抓革命促生产方针  积极地帮助贫下中农搞好春耕生产
    本报讯　驻辽宁省本溪市的人民解放军某团广大指战员，连日来积极深入当地农村生产队，一面向贫下中农和农村干部宣传伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，一面直接和社员一起投入紧张的春耕生产劳动。
    这个团的党委认为：当前春耕大忙季节即将到来，大力支持、帮助搞好当地春耕生产工作，是全团广大干部和战士的光荣职责。还在春节期间，广大干部和战士就一队队手捧着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，抬着毛主席语录板，高举着红旗，敲锣打鼓，斗志昂扬地奔赴十一个生产队。他们到了生产队里，首先抓紧时间利用炕头、地头广泛地向贫下中农和农村干部宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，同时他们和贫下中农一起踏着冰雪参加倒粪、送粪、整地等劳动。解放军的这种模范行动，使社员受到极大鼓舞。他们说：“解放军不仅支援我们生产，还给我们带来了毛主席的指示。我们一定要按照毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的指示，在春耕农忙的季节大抓革命，大促生产，既当革命的闯将，又当生产的先锋，夺取一九六七年革命、生产双丰收，出色地完成毛主席他老人家交给我们的光荣任务。”
    北沟大队第十生产队，在文化大革命深入发展的新形势下，生产领导班子不健全。部队机关干部带着毛主席著作来到这里。他们通过和队干部一起学习毛主席著作、开谈心会，帮助干部提高认识，勇于为革命挑担子；同时向广大社员宣传毛主席的干部政策，使这个队的革命、生产班子很快健全起来。西沟大队的干部，有的在文化大革命中犯了一些错误，社员给他们贴了大字报，思想上背了“包袱”。解放军四连副连长田凤久就和这些干部一起学习毛主席关于放下包袱、开动机器的教导，以及《红旗》杂志社论《响应毛主席的号召，到群众里面去》等文章，帮助他们消除顾虑，去掉“怕”字，树立“敢”字。在田凤久的热情帮助下，犯有一般错误的干部很快地提高了觉悟，勇敢地站出来担担子。他们诚恳地表示：一定要大胆地领导群众把春耕生产工作抓起来，为文化大革命和夺取今年的农业大丰收建立新的功劳。
