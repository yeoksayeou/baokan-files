		Vice Chief of General Staff Li Tianyou said at the banquet celebrating the unification of the armed forces of South Vietnam that the Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese brothers to achieve final victory.

		Acting Head of the Delegation Nguyen Minh Phuang exposes the U.S. imperialists' plot of expanding the invasion of Vietnam under the guise of peace talks.

		New China News Agency, February 13th: February 15th this year marks the sixth anniversary of the unification of the armed forces of South Vietnam. Tonight, Acting Head of the Delegation Nguyen Minh Phuang of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front Permanent Delegation to China held a banquet to celebrate this fighting holiday.

		Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, Vice Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Li Tianyou, Deputy Director of the General Political Department Xu Licheng, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, and other leaders from various military branches, services, and relevant departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were invited to attend the banquet.

		Nguyen Minh Phuang and Li Tianyou both spoke at the banquet. Nguyen Minh Phuang pointed out in his speech that the unification of the armed forces of South Vietnam represents the iron-willed determination of the people of South Vietnam to resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism. After introducing the victories achieved by the armed forces of South Vietnam in striking the U.S. imperialist invaders and the puppet forces, he said that the armed forces of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and stronger, achieving greater victories, and are driving the U.S. invaders and their lackeys to their graves.

		Nguyen Minh Phuang said that although the U.S. imperialists have suffered heavy defeats, they are not willing to admit defeat. Their nature is extremely stubborn, vicious, and cunning. Currently, they are frantically increasing their troops, transporting large quantities of modern warfare equipment to the south to further escalate the war of aggression, and continuously intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam. At the same time, they are everywhere peddling the old wares of "peace talks." He said that no matter how many troops, modern warfare equipment, or tricks and schemes the U.S. imperialists use, they cannot shake the iron-willed determination of the people of South Vietnam and their armed forces to liberate the south and unify the country.

		Li Tianyou, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest fraternal holiday greetings to the people of South Vietnam and all the comrades in the armed forces who are fighting bravely and striking hard at the U.S. aggressors. He said that the victory of the people of South Vietnam is a great victory of the people's war and a model of the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression by the peoples of all countries in the 1960s. The people of South Vietnam have set a brilliant example for the anti-U.S. struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world.

		Li Tianyou said that our great leader Chairman Mao said, "War educates the people, the people will win the war, win peace, and win progress." The armed forces of South Vietnam are completely united and fighting for the cause of liberating the people. They have a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses of the people and are supported and loved by the people. Such people's armed forces are invincible and will definitely defeat the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, win the final victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation war, and achieve the unification of their own country.

		Li Tianyou strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam on one hand and actively playing the "peace talks" trick on the other. He said that the modern revisionists centered on the leadership of the CPSU are also running around everywhere, shouting about "joint action" and working hard for the U.S. aggressors. Their evil purpose is to try to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's national revolutionary war against the U.S. No matter how they escalate the war and play what "peace talks" tricks, they cannot save themselves from failure. All those who follow the U.S. imperialists and serve the U.S. imperialists will not have a good end. When talking about the fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam, Li Tianyou said that the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam are brothers of the flesh and blood and close comrades-in-arms. In the long-term struggle against the common enemy, we have always been united, fought together, and won together. The Chinese people, armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support your struggle until we drive the U.S. aggressors completely, thoroughly, and cleanly out of Vietnam.

		The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Ly Chung Chi, and the Military Attaché, Colonel Chen Wenpeng, also attended the banquet.

    我副总参谋长李天佑在庆祝南越解放武装力量统一日的宴会上说
    中国人民坚决支持越南兄弟打到最后胜利
    阮明芳代理团长揭露美帝在和谈烟幕下扩大侵越战争
    新华社十三日讯　今年二月十五日是越南南方解放武装力量统一日六周年。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳今晚举行宴会，庆祝这一战斗的节日。
    国防委员会副主席叶剑英，中国人民解放军副总参谋长李天佑、总政治部副主任徐立清，外交部副部长韩念龙，以及中国人民解放军各军种、兵种和有关方面负责人，应邀出席了宴会。
    阮明芳和李天佑在宴会上先后讲话。阮明芳在讲话中指出，越南南方解放武装力量的统一，表示了南方人民抗击美帝国主义侵略的钢铁般的决心。他在介绍了南方解放武装力量打击美帝国主义侵略军和伪军所取得的胜利以后说，南方解放武装力量越战越强，越战越取得更大的胜利，并正在把美国侵略者及其走狗赶到灭亡的坟墓里去。
    阮明芳说，美帝国主义尽管遇到了惨败，可是不甘心失败。它的本质是极其顽固、极其凶恶和狡猾的。目前，它们正在大肆增兵，把大量的现代化的战争工具运往南方以便进一步扩大侵略战争，不断升级轰炸越南北方。同时，到处喋喋不休地叫卖“和谈”的老货色。他说，美帝国主义的任何军队，任何现代化的战争工具，任何阴谋和手段，都不能动摇越南南方人民及其武装力量要解放南方、统一祖国的铁一般的意志。
    李天佑代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向正在浴血战斗、狠狠地打击美国侵略强盗的越南南方人民和解放武装力量全体战友，致以最热烈的兄弟般的节日祝贺。他说，越南南方人民的胜利是人民战争的伟大胜利，是二十世纪六十年代世界各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略战争的典范。越南南方人民为全世界被压迫民族、被压迫人民的反美斗争树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    李天佑说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争，赢得和平，又赢得进步。”越南南方解放武装力量，完全是为着人民的解放事业而结合、而战斗的。她和人民群众有着血肉般的联系，受到人民的拥护和爱戴。这样的人民武装是无敌的，一定能够打败美帝及其走狗，赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利，实现自己祖国的统一。
    李天佑强烈谴责美帝国主义一方面正在加紧侵略越南的战争升级，另一方面又积极玩弄它的“和谈”阴谋。他说，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，也四处奔走，大喊大叫什么“联合行动”，为美国侵略者卖力。他们的罪恶目的，就是妄图扑灭越南人民反美民族革命战争的烈火，不管他们怎样加紧战争“升级”和玩弄什么“和谈”阴谋，都无法挽救他们失败的命运。一切追随美帝国主义，为美帝国主义效劳的人，是绝不会有好下场的。李天佑在谈到中越两国人民和军队的战斗友谊时说，中越两国人民和军队是骨肉般的兄弟和亲密的战友。在长期反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们一向是团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起的，用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，坚决支持你们的斗争，直到把美国侵略者彻底、干净、全部地赶出越南。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始、大使馆武官陈文彭上校，也出席了宴会。
