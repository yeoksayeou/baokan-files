Chinese students studying in Asian and European countries, along with our embassies, have been launching strong attacks on the Soviet revisionists in recent days. The traitors of Lenin will not meet a good end.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Chinese students studying in various Asian and European countries have been holding meetings, writing letters of support, and submitting protest letters to Soviet embassies and consulates. They strongly condemn the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist clique against Chinese students.

On January 31, Chinese students in Cambodia went to the Soviet embassy in Cambodia to submit a protest letter.

When the group of Chinese students in Cambodia arrived at the gate of the Soviet embassy, demanding to see the acting ambassador or his representative, the Soviet revisionists, feeling guilty and frightened, dared not come out. They closed all doors and windows and cut off the doorbell. The surrounding Cambodian people enthusiastically supported the Chinese students' just struggle. Some said, "The Soviet rulers have become revisionists." Others said, "Marx is good! Lenin is good! Chairman Mao is good!" Some Cambodian students pointed at the Soviet embassy and said, "How despicable! How despicable!"

Later, a Soviet diplomat came out from the main gate and pushed a Chinese student forcefully, also waving his fists at the Xinhua News Agency reporter who was covering the event. The Chinese students and the reporter immediately protested angrily. Seeing the situation turn against him, the man quickly fled.

On February 1, Chinese students studying in Pakistan submitted a protest letter to the Soviet Consul General in Karachi, Stukalin.

The protest letter stated: "Your counter-revolutionary actions will not end well. You will definitely 'lift a rock to drop on your own feet.' Your days are numbered."

When the Chinese students loudly read the protest letter, the Soviet Consul General, fearing to hear the truth, covered his ears with both hands in a very awkward manner.

Chinese students in Mali handed a protest letter addressed to Brezhnev and Kosygin to the Soviet Ambassador to Mali, Mosatov. The protest letter stated: "Did Chinese students in Europe and Iraq commit a 'crime' by laying wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Mausoleum, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing 'The Internationale'? We solemnly tell you: Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified. Our students in Europe and Iraq are right, and we firmly stand on their side. We firmly support them."

On January 31, Chinese students studying in Sweden went to the Soviet embassy in Sweden to submit a protest letter, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The protest letter stated: "The great people of the Soviet Union, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will forever maintain friendship with the Chinese people! They will never allow you, the traitors of Lenin, to do as you please! The day will come when the Soviet people will rise up to overthrow the revisionist rulers and seize your power."

On February 1, Chinese students studying in Poland wrote a letter to the Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Aristov, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists in Red Square.

According to a comprehensive report by our newspaper, our embassies in Myanmar, Yemen, Tanzania, Somalia, Congo (Brazzaville), the United Arab Republic, and Cuba have been holding meetings or writing letters to our students in Europe in recent days, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist clique's bloody suppression of our students in Europe, and highly praising the fearless revolutionary actions of our students in Europe.

At the same time, Xinhua News Agency's branches in Yangon, Sana'a, Dar es Salaam, Mogadishu, Brazzaville, Cairo, and Havana, as well as the China Civil Aviation Administration's office in Yangon, have also held meetings and sent telegrams and letters to our students in Europe, paying tribute to the glorious anti-revisionist fighters, and strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists.

In addition, Chinese experts in Myanmar, Yemen, Tanzania, Somalia, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), and Cuba have all expressed their indignation and strongly condemned the savage actions of the Soviet leaders, such as Brezhnev, in ordering the violent suppression of our students in Europe.

They unanimously warn the Soviet revisionists that Chinese students and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with, and the Soviet revisionists must pay for all the blood debts!

    我国留学生和驻外使馆等连日向苏修发动猛攻
    列宁的叛徒决没有好下场
    据新华社讯　我国在亚非和欧洲各国留学生，连日来分别举行集会、写声援信和向苏联使领馆递抗议书等，强烈抗议苏修集团对我国留学生进行血腥镇压的法西斯暴行。
    中国在柬埔寨的留学生一月三十一日前往苏修集团驻柬埔寨大使馆递交抗议书。
    在中国留柬学生的队伍到达苏修大使馆的门口，要求会见大使馆临时代办或者他的代表时，苏修分子理亏心虚，怕得要死，不敢出来。他们关闭了所有的门窗，并割断了电铃。周围的柬埔寨群众热烈支持中国学生的正义斗争。有的人说：“苏联统治者已经成为修正主义者了。”有的人说：“马克思好！列宁好！毛泽东主席好！”有些柬埔寨学生指着苏修大使馆说：“太恶劣了！太恶劣了！”
    后来苏修大使馆的一个外交官，从大门里出来，猛力推一名中国留学生，并且向在场采访的新华社记者挥舞拳头。中国留学生和记者立即愤怒地提出抗议。这个家伙一见势头不妙，吓得赶紧溜掉了。
    在巴基斯坦学习的中国留学生一日向苏联驻卡拉奇总领事斯图卡林递交了抗议书。
    抗议书说：“你们的反革命行动不会有好下场。你们也一定会‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。你们的寿命不长了。”
    在中国学生大声宣读抗议书的时候，害怕听到真理的声音的苏联总领事非常狼狈地用双手掩着耳朵。
    中国在马里的留学生，交给苏联驻马里大使莫萨托夫一封给勃列日涅夫和柯西金的抗议信。抗议信说：“中国留欧学生到列宁陵墓和斯大林墓献花圈，朗读毛主席语录和高唱《国际歌》，难道犯了什么‘罪’？我们义正词严地告诉你们：革命无罪，造反有理。我国留欧和留伊拉克学生做得对，我们坚决地站在他们一边，我们坚决地支持他们。”
    在瑞典学习的中国留学生一月三十一日前往苏修驻瑞典大使馆递交抗议信，最强烈地抗议苏修统治集团的法西斯暴行。抗议信说：“具有十月革命光荣传统的伟大的苏联人民定将同中国人民永远保持友好！他们决不允许你们——列宁的叛徒，为所欲为！苏联人民起来造修正主义统治者的反，夺你们的权的日子一定会到来的。”
    在波兰学习的中国留学生一日写信给苏修驻波兰大使阿里斯托夫，对苏修在红场干下的法西斯暴行，提出了最强烈的抗议。
    本报综合报道　我国驻缅甸、也门、坦桑尼亚、索马里、刚果（布）、阿联和古巴等国大使馆，连日来分别集会或写信给我国留欧学生，强烈抗议苏修集团血腥镇压我留欧学生的暴行，并高度赞扬我留欧学生大无畏的革命行动。
    同时，新华社驻仰光、萨那、达累斯萨拉姆、摩加迪沙、布拉柴维尔、开罗和哈瓦那等国外分社和中国民航局仰光办事处等，也纷纷举行集会和拍电报写信给我留欧学生，向光荣的反修战士致敬，强烈抗议苏修的法西斯暴行。
    此外，在缅甸、也门、坦桑尼亚、索马里、马里、刚果（布）和古巴等国的我国专家，都怀着愤慨心情，强烈抗议苏修头子勃列日涅夫之流指使暴力镇压我留欧学生的野蛮行径。
    他们一致警告苏修，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国学生和人民不是好惹的，苏修必须偿还全部血债！
