The Congolese people highly praise China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and refute the vicious slanders by imperialists and modern revisionists against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people.

A leader of a branch of the National Revolutionary Movement of Youth told a correspondent of Xinhua News Agency: "Although imperialists and modern revisionists are now doing their utmost to slander China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Congolese youth will never listen to them. We firmly believe that the purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao is to uproot capitalism and revisionism in China and to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat."

He said: "We support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because it is indeed a good thing for us. Chairman Mao pointed out: 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' The imperialists and revisionists are so afraid of this cultural revolution and engage in slander, which precisely proves that the cultural revolution is very good and that our stand is correct."

A Congolese friend named Fueniba wrote in a letter: "In the face of the anti-China propaganda launched by imperialists, revisionists, and their African lackeys, we will use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to defeat this propaganda so that the truth can spread throughout the world." He stressed that this propaganda campaign against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is doomed to failure because this cultural revolution is being carried out under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

A Congolese friend named Miyekamana wrote in a letter: "I have been closely following the news about China in order to use facts to refute the completely fabricated slanders by the international gendarmes and their running dogs against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led personally by the great helmsman, the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong."

    刚果（布）人民驳斥牛鬼蛇神的反华宣传
    中国文化大革命被帝修攻击是好事
    据新华社布拉柴维尔电　刚果（布）人民高度赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命，并驳斥帝国主义者和现代修正主义者恶毒诬蔑由中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场文化大革命。
    全国革命运动青年组织的一个支部的领导成员梭坡对新华社记者说：尽管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者现在竭力诬蔑中国和中国的文化大革命，“但是我们刚果青年决不听他们那一套，因为我们坚信，毛主席所发动的这场文化大革命的目的在于挖掉资本主义和修正主义在中国的根子，在于保卫无产阶级专政”。
    他说：“我们支持中国的文化大革命，因为这一革命对我们来说确实是一件好事。毛主席指出：‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’。帝国主义者和修正主义者这样害怕这场文化革命并且进行诽谤，这恰恰证明文化革命好得很，证明我们的立场是正确的。”
    一位名叫富厄尼巴的刚果朋友在一封信中说：面对着帝国主义者、修正主义者及其非洲仆从所发动的反华宣传，我们将用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来击败这种宣传，以便使真理传遍全世界。他强调指出，这一反对中国文化大革命的宣传活动是注定要失败的，因为这场文化大革命是在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下进行的。
    一位名叫米耶卡马纳的刚果朋友在信中说：“我极其密切地注意关于中国的消息，以便用事实来驳斥国际宪兵及其走狗所完全编造的对于由伟大的舵手、敬爱的毛泽东主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑。”
