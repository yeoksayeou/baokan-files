According to Xinhua News Agency, the completion ceremony for the Dugabge Sugar Factory, built with Chinese aid in Mali, was held on February 10th in a grand manner.

Mali President Modibo Keita attended the ceremony and inspected the sugar factory. Keita said, "Excellent," expressing his satisfaction with this construction project.

Samba Lamina Traore, the general manager of the largest state-owned enterprise in Mali, the Niger Company, which manages the sugar factory, spoke at the ceremony. He said that the completion of the Dugabge Sugar Factory is a great achievement and a fruit of the fighting friendship between the Republic of Mali and the great People's Republic of China. China has given us brotherly and effective aid. He said that the birth of the Dugabge Sugar Factory is a heavy blow to "neo-colonialism." He said: "Once again, I express my respect to the Chinese expert group. Under the inspiration of the great thought of Mao Zedong, they do not retreat in the face of any difficulties. Their work enthusiasm, their indomitable spirit, and their superb technology enable them to create miracles, thus showing us how the creators of a new life should work. They have set an example for the people of Mali."

Chinese experts have helped the people of Mali successfully cultivate sugarcane. The Dugabge Sugar Factory officially started production in January of this year, and Mali has thus ended its history of being unable to produce sugar.

    我援建的杜加布古糖厂落成
    据新华社巴马科电　中国援助马里兴建的杜加布古糖厂的落成典礼二月十日隆重举行。
    马里总统莫迪博·凯塔出席了这次典礼，并参观了糖厂。凯塔总统在参观糖厂时说：“真好”，表达了他对这项建设工程的满意心情。
    管理这座糖厂的马里最大的国营企业——尼日尔公司的总经理桑巴·拉明纳·特拉奥雷在典礼上讲了话。他说，杜加布古糖厂的建成，是一个伟大的成就，是马里共和国和伟大的中华人民共和国之间的战斗友谊的成果。中国给了我们兄弟般的和卓有成效的援助。他说，杜加布古糖厂的诞生是对“新殖民主义的沉重打击”。他说：“我再一次向中国专家小组表示敬意，他们在伟大的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，在任何困难面前毫不退缩，他们的工作热情，他们的坚韧不拔的精神以及他们的高超技术，使他们能够创造奇迹，从而向我们表明，新生活的缔造者应该怎样干，他们为马里人民树立了榜样。”
    中国专家帮助马里人民成功地种植了甘蔗。杜加布古糖厂今年一月正式投入生产，马里从此结束了不能生产糖的历史。
