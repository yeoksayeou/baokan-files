Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the 700 million Chinese people and the proletariat of all countries. Chairman Mao is the great leader and great helmsman of the 700 million Chinese people and the proletariat of all countries.

We firmly believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao will achieve thorough victory with the support of revolutionary people all over the world.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will triumph in all countries suffering from the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism, and will also triumph in the Soviet Union and other countries under the control of modern revisionism.

We will wage an uncompromising struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, as well as against modern revisionism.

Long live Chairman Mao! Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    世界革命人民支持文化大革命
    毛泽东思想是七亿中国人民和世界各国无产阶级的行动指南。毛主席是七亿中国人民和世界各国无产阶级的伟大领袖和伟大舵手。
    我们坚信，毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在全世界革命人民的支持下，一定取得彻底胜利。
    马列主义、毛泽东思想将在一切受到美帝国主义的侵略和干涉的国家里取得胜利，也必将在修正主义控制下的苏联和修正主义控制下的其他国家里取得胜利。
    我们将同美帝国主义及其走狗和现代修正主义进行毫不妥协的斗争。
    毛主席万岁！把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
