On February 9, the Soviet government suddenly and unilaterally tore up the agreement between China and the Soviet Union on mutual visa exemption. This is another serious step taken by the Soviet revisionist leadership to escalate their anti-China campaign and further deteriorate relations between the two countries. It is another new crime committed by them in their attempt to sabotage the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

In the past half month, the Soviet government has twice instigated bloody incidents in Moscow, beating up Chinese students and diplomatic personnel. Now, it has unilaterally torn up the agreement on mutual visa exemption between China and the Soviet Union. This shows to what extent the Soviet revisionist leadership has gone in its anti-China policy. The Soviet revisionists' actions do not mean that they are powerful. On the contrary, they fully expose their weakness and stupidity, showing that the Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified of the great thought of Mao Zedong! They are terrified of the fearless proletarian revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people! They are terrified of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism!

The Soviet revisionists think they can obstruct the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and block the voice of truth by tearing up the agreement on mutual visa exemption. This is a futile attempt. Chairman Mao said: “‘Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,’ is a Chinese idiom used to describe the behavior of some stupid people. The reactionaries in various countries are exactly such a bunch of stupid people.” The Soviet revisionists are exactly such a small clique of stupid people. The Soviet revisionists' frenzied anti-China actions can only further expose their reactionary nature and weakness, further arouse the indignation of the Soviet people, and drive them to rise up in rebellion and throw them into the dustbin of history!

Now, our government has lodged the strongest protest against the Soviet government's unreasonable act of unilaterally destroying the agreement on mutual visa exemption, and has taken corresponding measures to give a resolute rebuff to the Soviet government's unreasonable actions. The Chinese people fully support and resolutely back our government's just actions.

The great and invincible thought of Mao Zedong can never be blocked!

The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples can never be broken by any reactionary forces!

The Soviet revisionist leadership, which is anti-China and anti-people, will not have a good ending!

    苏修反华的又一严重步骤
    本报评论员
    二月九日，苏联政府突然片面撕毁中苏两国互免签证的协议。这是苏联修正主义领导集团加剧反华、进一步恶化中苏两国关系的又一个严重步骤，是它破坏中苏两国人民伟大友谊的又一桩新罪行。
    最近半个月来，苏联政府竟在莫斯科两次制造流血事件，毒打我国留学生和外交工作人员。现在它又片面撕毁中苏两国互免签证的协议。这表明苏联修正主义领导集团推行反华政策达到了何等严重的地步。苏修这样做并不意味着它有什么了不起。恰恰相反，而是充分暴露它虚弱和愚蠢，表明苏联修正主义领导集团对伟大的毛泽东思想怕得要死！对中国人民大无畏的无产阶级革命精神怕得要死！对中苏两国人民反帝反修的战斗友谊怕得要死！
    苏修先生们想用撕毁中苏两国互免签证协议的手段来阻挠中苏两国人民的友谊，封锁真理的声音，那是痴心妄想。毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏修正是这样的一小撮蠢人。苏修集团的疯狂反华行为，只能更加暴露自己反动的面目和虚弱的本质，更加激起苏联人民的怒火，起来造他们的反，把他们扔进历史的垃圾堆！
    现在，我国政府对苏联政府无理破坏两国互免签证的协议提出了最强烈的抗议，并且采取了相应的措施，对苏联政府的无理行径给以坚决的回击。中国人民完全拥护和坚决支持我国政府的正义行动。
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想是永远封锁不了的！
    中苏两国人民的友谊是任何反动势力打不破的！
    反华反人民的苏联修正主义领导集团是不会有好下场的！
