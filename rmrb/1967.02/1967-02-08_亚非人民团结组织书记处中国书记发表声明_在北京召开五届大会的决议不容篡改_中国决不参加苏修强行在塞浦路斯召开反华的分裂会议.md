The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in China Issues a Statement
The Resolution to Hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing Cannot Be Altered
China Will Not Attend the Anti-China Splitist Conference Forced by the Soviet Revisionists in Cyprus

	Cairo, Feb. 6 (New China News Agency) — Liang Geng, the Chinese Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, reaffirmed today that China will not attend the so-called Eighth Conference of the Asian-African Solidarity Council, which is being illegally convened in Cyprus by the Soviet revisionists. He also reiterated China's firm stand on the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winnipeg to convene the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. He pointed out that the Cyprus Council convened by the Soviet revisionists is an anti-China splitist conference and that they must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

	The Chinese Secretary distributed a statement at a press conference held by the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo. The statement said: "The Soviet revisionists are manipulating the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization to convene the Cyprus Council in an attempt to overturn the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Winnipeg to convene the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year and to make final organizational preparations for the complete split of the Asian-African people's solidarity movement."

	The statement emphasized: "China will not attend this anti-China splitist conference; this conference has no right to discuss the venue of the Fifth Conference, and any alteration of the resolution of the Winnipeg Conference is illegal and absolutely invalid. If the Soviet revisionists insist on going their own way, they must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom."

	Liang Geng said: "I solemnly declare that I refuse to participate in the Secretariat's preparations for the so-called Cyprus Council; I do not assume any obligation for any decision made by the Secretariat under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists regarding the preparations for the Council."

	The statement finally stressed: "The Chinese people have always firmly supported the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia and Africa and firmly supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation. I want to inform the Secretariat that the Chinese people and the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity are determined to carry out the resolution of the Winnipeg Conference to convene the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year to safeguard the cause of Asian-African people's solidarity against imperialism and to defend the Asian-African people's solidarity movement."

	In answering questions, Liang Geng cited a large number of facts to expose that the Soviet modern revisionists have all along pursued a line of capitulation to U.S. imperialism and sabotage of the Asian-African people's solidarity movement.

	At the press conference, the Soviet revisionists, faced with facts, did not dare to come out to defend their exposed plots, which further exposed their true colors as the No. 1 accomplice of U.S. imperialism and traitors to the cause of Asian-African people's solidarity against imperialism. The free fighters of Asia and Africa present pointed out that the Soviet revisionists are in the position of the accused because of their treacherous activities. These free fighters shook hands warmly with the Chinese Secretary after the press conference, expressing their firm support for China's just and correct stand.

	The Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, who presided over the press conference, defended in vain the Cyprus Council convened by the Soviet Union. In answering questions, he did not even dare to announce that Japan and Thailand had refused to attend the so-called Council.

	Earlier, the Japanese Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, Kitazawa Masao, had already announced his withdrawal from the preparatory meeting of the Secretariat for the so-called Cyprus Council.

    亚非人民团结组织书记处中国书记发表声明
    在北京召开五届大会的决议不容篡改
    中国决不参加苏修强行在塞浦路斯召开反华的分裂会议
    新华社开罗六日电  亚非人民团结组织书记处中国书记梁耕六日重申中国决不参加苏联修正主义者策划在塞浦路斯非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，并坚持温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议的严正立场。他强调指出，苏联修正主义者策划召开的塞浦路斯理事会是一个反华的分裂会议，它要对由此而产生的一切严重后果负全部责任。
    中国书记在开罗的亚非人民团结组织书记处举行的记者招待会上散发声明。声明指出：“苏联修正主义者操纵亚非人民团结组织书记处，强行召开塞浦路斯理事会，就是妄图推翻温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，在组织上为全面分裂亚非人民团结运动作出最后的准备。”
    声明强调：“中国决不参加这个反华的分裂会议；这次会议根本无权讨论第五届大会地点的问题，对温尼巴大会决议的任何篡改，都是非法的和绝对无效的。如果苏联修正主义者一意孤行，由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由它负全部责任。”
    梁耕说：“我郑重声明：我拒绝参加书记处关于讨论所谓塞浦路斯理事会的筹备工作；我对书记处在苏联修正主义者操纵下作出的任何关于理事会的筹备工作的决定，不承担任何义务。”
    声明最后强调指出：“中国人民一贯坚决支持亚非各国人民的民族解放运动，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。我要通知书记处，中国人民和中国亚非团结委员会决心贯彻温尼巴大会关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，以维护亚非人民团结反帝的事业和保卫亚非人民团结运动。”
    梁耕在答复问题时列举了大量事实，揭露苏联现代修正主义者一直奉行向美帝国主义投降、破坏亚非人民团结运动的分裂路线。
    在记者招待会上，苏联修正主义者在事实面前无法抵赖，自始至终一言不发，不敢出来为他们被戳穿了的阴谋辩解，这就进一步暴露了他们充当美帝国主义头号帮凶和亚非人民团结反帝事业的叛徒的真面目。到会的亚非自由战士指出：苏联修正主义者由于背叛活动而处于被告地位。这些自由战士在记者招待会结束后同中国书记热烈握手，表示他们坚决支持中国的正义和正确立场。
    主持记者招待会的亚非人民团结组织书记处总书记理屈词穷地为苏联策划召开的塞浦路斯理事会辩解。他在回答问题时甚至不敢宣布日本和泰国拒绝参加所谓的理事会。
    早些时候，亚非人民团结组织书记处的日本书记北泽政雄已经宣布退出讨论所谓塞浦路斯理事会的筹备工作的书记处会议。
