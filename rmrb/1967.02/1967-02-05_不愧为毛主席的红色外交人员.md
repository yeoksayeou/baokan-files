The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the dear comrades at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union in Moscow:

We, on behalf of the greatest leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extend our warm greetings to you, the brave anti-revisionist fighters.

In the heart of Moscow, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, you have held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and waged a resolute struggle against the Soviet revisionist leadership. When the thugs, directed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, launched a savage attack on our embassy, you stood up bravely, fearless of violence, disregarding personal danger, and defended with your blood the dignity of our great socialist motherland under the dictatorship of the proletariat. You have withstood a severe test in international class struggle. You are models in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. You are truly red diplomats who are loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. You have not disappointed the hopes of the 700 million people. All diplomatic personnel should learn from you.

Salute to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Zhou Enlai
Chen Yi
