Cadres resolutely join poor and lower-middle peasants to make revolution. Black Water Bay Production Brigade mobilizes all forces to welcome spring plowing and sowing.

	BEIJING, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- Cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of the Black Water Bay Production Brigade, Kuanshanji People's Commune, Pinggu County, Beijing suburbs, have responded to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to seize the revolution and promote production. They have mobilized all forces to launch a spring plowing and sowing campaign, determined to win victories in both revolution and production.

	After the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Throughout the Country" was broadcast, revolutionary youths told the cadres, "Poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for seizing the revolution and promoting production. We are the shock troops for doing a good job in spring plowing and sowing. We will do the heavy and difficult work." The cadres said, "We are also shock troops." Thus, members and cadres together braved the cold and carried out extensive basic farmland construction. In the evening, after the members had finished work, the women's brigade leader, brigade leader, and poor peasants' association chairman and others were still in the fields breaking up clods. After returning to the village, some cadres began to collect manure, actively preparing for fertilization. Seeing this, the poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Our revolutionary cadres really listen to Chairman Mao's words. Whatever sweat and dirt we have on our bodies, they have just as much. Everyone is united in seizing the revolution and promoting production. This year's bumper harvest is assured."

	Most of the cadres in this brigade and its production teams are activists who emerged during the Four Cleanups movement. Since the start of the cultural revolution in rural areas, they have adopted the attitude of "having something to change, nothing to add." On the one hand, they have voluntarily checked with poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, burned themselves to accept criticism from the masses, and stood with the revolutionary masses to make revolution. On the other hand, they have organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and taken the lead in participating in collective production. Since last winter, when the cultural revolution began, the revolutionary members and cadres of the brigade, following Chairman Mao's teachings, learned the spirit of self-reliance from Dazhai, "made up their minds, were not afraid of sacrifice, overcame all difficulties, and strove for victory." Every day, more than 100 strong laborers were sent out to renovate more than 30 mu of riverbank land that had been destroyed by floods 30 years ago. Everyone moved huge rocks, built dikes, and transported soil from three li away to fill the riverbank. After more than a month of hard work, the riverbank land was renovated and ready for spring sowing. Recently, to ensure timely transportation of fruits from the mountainous areas this year and to facilitate agricultural production, they have widened a three-li-long narrow path into a spacious road.

    干部坚决和贫下中农一起闹革命 
    黑水湾大队动员一切力量迎接春耕春播
    本报讯　北京郊区平谷县靠山集公社黑水湾大队的革命干部和贫下中农，以实际行动响应毛主席和党中央的战斗号召，抓革命，促生产，动员一切力量，掀起了春耕生产热潮，决心夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》广播后，革命青年就向干部说：“贫下中农是抓革命、促生产的主力军，我们是搞好春耕生产的突击队，重活、难活由咱们干。”干部们说：“我们也是突击队员。”于是，社员和干部一起冒着严寒，大搞农田基本建设。傍晚，社员收工了，妇女大队长、队长和贫协主任等，还在地里打土坷垃。回村以后，有的干部又掏起粪来，积极为送肥作准备。贫下中农看到这种情况后说：“咱们的革命干部最听毛主席的话，我们身上有多少汗水和泥巴，他们身上就有多少，大家一个心气抓革命，促生产，今年的丰收就能稳拿了。”
    这个大队和各生产队的干部，绝大多数是在四清运动中涌现出来的积极分子。农村文化大革命开始以来，他们抱着“有则改之，无则加勉”的态度，一方面主动向贫下中农和革命群众作检查，引火烧身，接受群众的批评，和革命群众站在一起闹革命；一方面又组织大家学习毛主席著作，带头参加集体生产。去冬文化大革命开始后，大队的革命社员和革命干部，根据毛主席的教导，学习大寨自力更生的革命精神，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”每天出动一百多个壮劳力，改造三十年前被洪水冲毁的三十多亩河滩地。大家搬掉巨石，垒起坝堰，从三里以外运土填滩，奋战一个多月，把河滩地整修一新，准备春播。近日，他们为了今年及时外运山区的水果和方便农业生产，又把一条三里多长的羊肠小道修成了宽敞的大路。
