Millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres across the country are overjoyed by the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes. They enthusiastically respond to the great call of the most beloved and respected leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, determined to seize the revolution and promote production, immediately sounding the drums for the spring plowing campaign.

Some cadres who have made mistakes have expressed their excitement, saying that they will definitely work together with the masses to do a good job in spring plowing and production, making amends with practical actions.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd, millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes across the country have studied the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with great excitement. They enthusiastically respond to the great call of the most beloved and respected leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, determined to seize the revolution and promote production, immediately sounding the drums for the spring plowing campaign, and creating a high tide of spring plowing production to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

Wherever the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is distributed, there is a wave of excitement. Poor and lower-middle peasants and commune and brigade cadres hold meetings and discussions, igniting an unprecedented enthusiasm and vigor for seizing the revolution and promoting production. They say: Chairman Mao understands us poor and lower-middle peasants the best. The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China speaks to our hearts. This letter is the greatest encouragement, trust, and support from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

Poor and lower-middle peasants in Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Hubei, Henan, Jilin, Shanxi, Liaoning, Gansu, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Xinjiang emphasized when cheering for the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that we poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for seizing the revolution and promoting production in the countryside. We will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao's trust and expectations, seriously seize the revolution and promote production, mobilize all forces, and immediately work hard for spring plowing and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants, cadres, workers, and local troops in Yanqing County, Beijing suburbs, carried Chairman Mao's portrait and held high Chairman Mao's quotation cards, gathering in the county seat for a mass rally to read the letter from the Party Central Committee. The meeting was filled with thunderous applause and shouts: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to 'seize the revolution and promote production'!" "Fire the first shot for spring plowing production!" "Sweep away double victories in revolution and production!" The representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres expressed in their speeches: Firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, carry forward the Daqing spirit, shoulder the burdens of revolution and production, and strive for victory in spring plowing production. The letter from the Party Central Committee was broadcast through the powerful wired broadcast network in the suburbs of Shanghai, reaching the fields and villages. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres expressed with revolutionary enthusiasm that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively shoulder the burdens of revolution and production, and do a better job in both.

Poor and lower-middle peasants of Xujing Brigade, Xujing Commune, Jiading County, who were working in the rain to build an irrigation canal, excitedly said: We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, show the spirit of the main force, seize the revolution and promote production, be both revolutionary vanguards and production models! We will definitely complete the task of building a 10,000-meter-long canal before the busy spring sowing season and strive for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year. After the letter from the Party Central Committee was broadcast, the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province were in an uproar. Poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres said they would definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongwei Commune, Harbin suburbs, have carried out the Cultural Revolution vigorously and energetically, and the preparatory work for production this year started earlier and better than in previous years. After hearing the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, they immediately held study and discussion sessions, identified gaps in preparatory work, and decided to overcome the mentality of "good enough," mobilize all forces, and do a better job in preparatory work for production. Poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the people's communes in the suburbs of Nanjing enthusiastically cheered, saying that the letter from the Party Central Committee is the greatest support for us revolutionaries. It is like a timely rain, nourishing the red hearts of the revolutionaries. When the letter from the Party Central Committee was distributed to Shiyue People's Commune, where Chairman Mao had inspected ten years ago, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres there were so excited that they jumped for joy. They excitedly said: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, how much we miss you! Ten years ago, it was you who pointed out the direction for us to move forward, guiding us to turn barren hills into orchards! Today, you have once again issued the great call to "seize the revolution and promote production." We will definitely listen to your words and act according to your instructions! The revolutionary cadres of Suzhuang Brigade, Nancao Commune, Zhengzhou suburbs, immediately seized the opportunity after the rain to engage in intensive land cultivation, top dressing, and intercultivation activities. The letter from the Party Central Committee was distributed to the Ili Valley in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the poor and lower-middle peasants of thirteen ethnic groups were extremely excited. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Sanbrigade, Hongxing Commune, Yining City, read the letter from the Party Central Committee over and over again. Here, the snow has not yet melted, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have already started top dressing for winter wheat in advance. The broad masses of Uygur poor and lower-middle peasants in Wuxing Commune, Tuluofan County, who are busy sowing spring wheat, regard the issuance of the letter from the Party Central Committee as a great joy. They said excitedly: "Chairman Mao is always in our hearts. What the Party Central Committee's letter says is what we think. We Uygur poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We will seize the revolution and promote production, fire the first shot for spring plowing production, and report to Chairman Mao with the best results."

The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province held a telephone conference on the evening of the 21st, reading the letter from the Party Central Committee to the revolutionary masses across the province and suggesting that all places hold three-level cadre meetings at the commune level before the 28th of February to deploy spring plowing production work. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call is like a spring breeze blowing through the rural areas of Guizhou Province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres expressed their determination to seize the opportunity with a spirit of "seizing the day," and to grasp the preparatory and spring plowing work solidly and practically, creating a vigorous spring plowing production campaign across the province.

The letter from the Party Central Committee has greatly encouraged and urged the cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes. Some cadres who have made general mistakes have expressed their excitement, saying that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have pointed out the direction for us to strive. We must go to the masses, humbly be the students of the masses, discuss with the poor and lower-middle peasants, discuss with the laboring masses, and together do a good job in spring plowing production, making amends with practical actions.

The revolutionary cadres of Dongzha People's Commune in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, located in the Hangjiahu area, immediately held a meeting of brigade, production team cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasant association chairpersons after receiving the letter from the Party Central Committee. The cadres unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses to fight a good battle in spring plowing production. After joint research, they formulated a production plan for late February to late April, and finally wrote a letter of determination, promising Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee: We will definitely achieve double victories in revolution and production. Many revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Shanghai expressed their determination to go to the front line of spring plowing production after studying the letter from the Party Central Committee, discussing and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and seriously grasping production. A brigade leader from a poor peasant background in Humpu Brigade, Yanghang Commune, Baoshan County, had made some mistakes in the past. During the Cultural Revolution, he humbly listened to the criticism of the masses, seriously examined his mistakes, and actively grasped production, arranged farm work, and labored with the commune members. Some brigade cadres in the suburbs of Beijing and Xi'an also actively examined their past mistakes of wanting to give up after reading the letter from the Party Central Committee. They expressed their determination not to disappoint the expectations of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, definitely uniting with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, seizing the revolution, promoting production, and working hard for a bumper harvest this year.

Many poor and lower-middle peasants in the Third Production Brigade of Yangyang Commune, Yuanping County, Shanxi Province, said: Chairman Mao teaches us that we should "punish the past and cure the future, treat the illness and save the patient" for comrades who have made mistakes. Some cadres have made some mistakes in the past, but as long as they are willing to correct them, we should wholeheartedly help them and work together with them to revolutionize and do a good job in production this year.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yantian People's Commune in the suburbs of Lanzhou work on production during the day and revolution at night, mobilizing all labor forces to work early and late, fertilizing, raising seedlings, and strengthening field management, making this brigade's cultural revolution and production both show a prosperous new situation.

    贵州省革命委员会二十一日晚上召开电话会议，向全省无产阶级革命派宣读了党中央的信，并且建议全省各地在二月二十八日以前，以公社为单位，召开三级干部会议，布置春耕生产工作。毛主席、党中央这一号召象春风一样吹遍了贵州山区农村。广大贫下中农和革命干部表示，决心以“只争朝夕”的精神，不失时机地扎扎实实地抓好备耕、春耕工作，在全省范围内掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产热潮。
    党中央的信使农村人民公社各级干部受到极大鼓舞和鞭策。一些曾经犯过一般错误的干部，激动地表示，毛主席和党中央给我们指出了努力方向，我们一定要到群众中去，老老实实作群众的小学生，同贫下中农一起商量，同劳动群众一起商量，共同搞好春耕生产，以实际行动将功补过。
    位于杭嘉湖地区的浙江省嘉兴县东栅人民公社的革命派，接到党中央的信后，立即召开了大队、生产队干部和贫协组长会议。干部们一致表示，坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，和贫下中农以及革命群众一道，共同打好春耕生产这一仗。经过共同研究，他们订出了二月下旬到四月下旬的生产计划，最后还写了决心书，向毛主席和党中央保证：一定要夺取革命、生产的双胜利。上海郊区许多革命干部学习了党中央的信以后，纷纷表示要到春耕生产第一线去，同贫下中农一起商量，一起劳动，认真抓好生产。宝山县杨行公社湄浦大队一个贫农出身的大队长，曾经犯过一些错误。在文化大革命中他一面虚心听取群众批评，认真检查错误，一面积极抓生产，安排农活，同社员一起劳动。北京和西安郊区的一些生产队干部在读了党中央的信以后，也主动检查了自己过去想撂挑子的错误思想，他们表示，决不辜负毛主席、党中央的希望，一定和广大贫下中农团结起来，抓革命，促生产，为争取今年的大丰收努力工作。
    山西省原平县崞阳公社第三生产大队的许多贫下中农说：毛主席教导我们，对犯错误的同志要“惩前毖后、治病救人”，有些干部过去虽然犯了一些错误，只要他们愿意改正，我们就要满腔热情地帮助他们，和他们一起革命，一起把今年的生产搞好。
    兰州市郊雁滩人民公社的贫下中农白天抓生产，晚上闹革命，动员了所有劳动力，起早贪黑地积肥、育苗，加强田间管理，使这个大队的文化革命和生产都出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
