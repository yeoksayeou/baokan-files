Five African Nationalist Organizations Issue Joint Statement
Insist on Holding the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing
Strongly Condemn the Soviet Revisionist Leadership for Playing a Role as Despicable as American Imperialism

	NICOSIA, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Four African member delegations of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and one African liberation movement organization issued a joint statement here on Feb. 15, expressing their firm determination to uphold the resolution of the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Winneba last year to convene the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. They strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for its evil activities in disrupting and splitting the Afro-Asian people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement.

	The four delegations are the South West Africa People's Organization, the Botswana People's Party, the Basutoland Congress Party and the Swaziland Progressive Party. The African liberation movement organization is the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa).

	The joint statement stressed that the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa are determined to rely on their own strength to overthrow the rule of imperialism and old and new colonialism, and to fight against modern revisionism. The oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must be liberated; the peoples under the rule of modern revisionism in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries must be liberated; imperialism and revisionism must be defeated.

	The joint statement condemned the Soviet revisionists for expelling the South West Africa People's Organization from the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization at the so-called Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council Organizing Committee meeting held on the morning of Feb. 15, which was forcibly convened by the Soviet revisionists. The joint statement pointed out: "Expelling the South West Africa People's Organization by high-handed means is not only contrary to the rules but also directly conflicts with the spirit of the historic Winneba Conference." This action "clearly shows the role of the Soviet Union in splitting the solidarity of the Afro-Asian peoples."

	The joint statement condemned the Soviet revisionist clique for viciously attacking anti-imperialist organizations in Asia and Africa and for admitting followers of revisionism such as the organizations in Ceylon and Japan into the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization. The statement said, "The Soviet revisionists are now playing a role as despicable as that of the United States in the United Nations."

	The joint statement solemnly declared: "Any resolution passed at this meeting has no binding force on us."

	Zimbabwe African National Union Secretary for External Affairs Herbert Chitepo, who was in Nicosia, expressed support for the just stand of the four African delegations in withdrawing from this illegal meeting and pointed out that all the decisions made at this meeting were illegal.

	Chitepo said, "The manipulators of this illegal meeting are seeking their own interests, not the true interests of the fighting peoples of Asia and Africa."

	According to Xinhua, the General Secretary of the Francophone West African Solidarity Movement and Senegalese professor, Li Tidiangne Bedie, recently announced in Bamako that he would uphold the resolution of the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Winneba last year to convene the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. He stressed that the Soviet revisionists, by illegally convening the so-called Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council in Cyprus, are attempting to impose their will on the peoples of various countries and to use African revolutionary fighters as puppets and tools for their treacherous policies. He said: "Any alteration of the will of the Conference, whether by the Council or the Cairo Secretariat, under any pressure, is unacceptable. Any betrayal of the resolution of the Winneba Conference, due to its illegal nature, can only serve to split the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries and to present a gift to the imperialists and revisionists."

    五个非洲民族主义组织发表联合声明
    坚持在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会
    强烈谴责苏修领导集团扮演同美帝国主义一样可卑的角色
    新华社十九日讯　尼科西亚消息：亚非人民团结组织的四个非洲成员代表团和一个非洲解放运动组织，十五日在尼科西亚发表联合声明，表示坚决维护温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，并强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团破坏和分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪恶活动。
    这四个代表团是西南非洲民族联盟、贝专纳人民党、巴苏陀兰大会党和斯威士兰进步党。一个非洲解放运动组织是阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会。
    联合声明强调指出，亚非革命人民决心依靠自己的力量，推翻帝国主义和新老殖民主义的统治，并决心同现代修正主义作斗争。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的被压迫人民必须获得解放；现代修正主义者统治下的苏联和一些东欧国家的人民必须获得解放；必须击败帝国主义和修正主义。
    联合声明谴责苏联修正主义者十五日上午在由它强行召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会的组织委员会会议上把西南非洲民族联盟非法
  “开除”出亚非人民团结组织。联合声明指出：“用高压手段‘开除’西南非洲民族联盟不仅是不符合规章的，而且是同具有历史意义的温尼巴会议的精神直接冲突的。”这一行动“清楚地表明了苏联所起的分裂亚非人民团结的作用。”
    联合声明谴责苏修集团在这次非法会议上恶毒攻击亚非的反帝组织和接纳修正主义的追随者如锡兰和日本等分裂组织加入亚非人民团结组织。声明说，苏联修正主义者“现在正在扮演同美国在联合国中一样可卑的角色。”
    联合声明严正表示：“在这次会议上所作出的任何决议对我们都没有约束力。”
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟负责对外事务的书记穆坦巴内格威十六日在尼科西亚举行的记者招待会上，表示支持上述四个非洲代表团退出这一非法会议的正义立场，并指出这一会议通过的所有决定都是非法的。
    穆坦巴内格威说，这一非法会议的操纵者“在谋取他们自己的私利，而不是为了亚非战斗人民的真正利益”。
    据新华社巴马科电　法语西非团结运动总书记、塞内加尔教授利·蒂迪亚内·贝迪最近在这里宣布坚持温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议。他强调指出：苏联修正主义者在塞浦路斯非法召开所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，企图把自己的意志强加于各国人民，企图把非洲革命战士当作傀儡和当作他们的叛卖政策的工具。他说：“理事会或开罗书记处，不管是在什么压力下，对大会的意志的任何篡改，都是不能容许的。对温尼巴大会决议的任何背叛，由于它的非法性质，其目的只能是分裂各国人民的革命运动，而给帝国主义者和修正主义者献礼。”
