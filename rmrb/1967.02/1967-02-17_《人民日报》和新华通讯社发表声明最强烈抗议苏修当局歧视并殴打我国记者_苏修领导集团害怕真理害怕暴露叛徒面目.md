The People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency Issue Statement Strongly Protesting the Soviet Revisionist Authorities' Discrimination and Assault on Our Country's Journalists
The Soviet Revisionist Leadership Fears the Truth and Fears Exposing Their Traitorous Faces

	Xinhua News Agency, February 16th

	The People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency issued a statement on February 16th, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities and unreasonable discrimination by the Soviet authorities against Chinese journalists. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has recently repeatedly instigated thugs to brutally assault Chinese journalists and arrogantly obstruct the normal reporting activities of Chinese journalists. This is a serious provocation by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against the news workers of socialist China, a new serious anti-China incident created by the Soviet authorities to serve the needs of U.S. imperialism, a gross violation of international norms, and a new crime of their deliberate intention to further deteriorate Sino-Soviet relations and sabotage the friendship between the two peoples. We strongly protest against this!

	For a long time, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has imposed various unreasonable restrictions and discriminatory measures on Chinese journalists stationed in Moscow. Recently, they have shamelessly committed fascist barbaric atrocities against Chinese journalists. On January 25th, Soviet military police and plainclothes agents brutally assaulted new Xinhua News Agency journalists Ding Xiangqi and Zhang Jinghai while suppressing Chinese students in Europe who were laying wreaths at Lenin's and Stalin's mausoleums. The photographs taken by Chinese journalists on the spot revealing the truth of this bloody incident were sent to the Central Telegraph Office in Moscow on the morning of the 26th and were unreasonably detained. On January 28th, Chinese students in Iraq went to the Soviet Embassy in Iraq to protest against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist authorities in suppressing Chinese students in Europe, and were brutally assaulted by more than 30 thugs from the Soviet Embassy in Iraq. The Xinhua News Agency journalist Shen Rugang, who was on the scene covering the event, was also injured, and his camera was seized, the film was exposed, and then the camera was smashed. On February 3rd, Soviet thugs forcibly broke into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, smashed and seized the news photo exhibition window of the Chinese Embassy, and savagely assaulted Chinese diplomatic representatives, embassy staff, and People's Daily journalist Xie Wenqing and Xinhua News Agency journalist Ding Xiangqi. Their cameras were damaged, and their flashlights were seized. Even so, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique still felt it was not enough, and on February 9th, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department publicly banned Chinese journalists from taking photographs on Soviet territory.

	The bad deeds done by the Soviet revisionists once again prove that they have completely betrayed the great Lenin and the great Soviet people. They are not afraid to commit such heinous atrocities that defy the world, because they are extremely weak and panicked. They fear the truth, fear that Chinese journalists will truthfully report the truth of their various bad deeds, and fear that their traitorous faces of anti-China, anti-revolution, and anti-people will be thoroughly exposed. Chairman Mao said: "Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet," is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. We warn the Soviet authorities: the truth cannot be strangled, facts cannot be covered up, the people of the world cannot be deceived, and Chinese news workers armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are not afraid of any violence. You will only drop the stone on your own feet. All anti-China elements will meet a bad end!

	The People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency solemnly declare: The Soviet authorities must guarantee the personal safety of Chinese journalists and all conditions for them to carry out normal reporting work. Chinese journalists stationed in Moscow have always conducted truthful reporting, and their right to carry out normal reporting activities (including taking news photographs) is not to be infringed upon. Any discriminatory measures against Chinese journalists by the Soviet authorities are unacceptable. If you insist on your own way, all consequences arising therefrom will be the full responsibility of the Soviet government.

    《人民日报》和新华通讯社发表声明最强烈抗议苏修当局歧视并殴打我国记者
    苏修领导集团害怕真理害怕暴露叛徒面目
    新华社十六日讯　《人民日报》和新华通讯社二月十六日发表声明，就苏联当局对中国记者的法西斯暴行和无理歧视，提出最强烈的抗议。声明全文如下：
    苏联修正主义统治集团最近一再指使暴徒野蛮殴打中国记者，蛮横阻挠中国记者的正常采访活动。这是苏修统治集团对社会主义中国的新闻工作者的严重挑衅，是苏联当局适应美帝国主义需要制造的新的严重反华事件，是对国际关系准则的粗暴践踏，是他们蓄意进一步恶化中苏两国关系和破坏两国人民友谊的新罪行。我们对此提出最强烈的抗议！
    苏修统治集团长期以来对中国驻莫斯科记者采取了种种无理限制和歧视的做法。最近他们竟然肆无忌惮地对中国记者采取法西斯野蛮暴行。一月二十五日，苏联军警和便衣特务在红场镇压向列宁和斯大林陵墓献花圈的中国留欧学生时，野蛮殴打了到场采访的新华社记者丁翔起和张景海。中国记者在现场拍摄的这次流血事件真相的照片在二十六日上午送到莫斯科中央电报局用传真发给新华总社，也被无理扣压。一月二十八日，中国在伊拉克的留学生前往苏联驻伊拉克大使馆抗议苏修当局镇压中国留欧学生的法西斯暴行，遭到苏联驻伊拉克大使馆三十多名暴徒的野蛮殴打，到场采访的新华社记者沈如钢也被打伤，他的照相机被抢去把胶卷曝光后又被砸碎。二月三日，苏联暴徒强行闯入中国驻苏联大使馆，砸坏并劫走中国大使馆的新闻图片展览橱窗，残暴地殴打了中国外交代表、使馆工作人员以及《人民日报》记者谢文清和新华社记者丁翔起，他们的照相机被打坏，闪光灯被抢走。就这样，苏修统治集团还觉得不够，二月九日又由苏联外交部新闻司出面公然禁止中国记者在苏联领土上拍照。
    苏联修正主义者干的这些坏事又一次证明了他们彻底背叛了伟大的列宁和伟大的苏联人民。他们不惜冒天下之大不韪干出这样令人发指的暴行，是因为他们极端虚弱和恐慌，他们害怕真理，害怕中国记者如实报道他们干的各种坏事的真相，害怕他们反华、反革命、反人民的叛徒面目被彻底揭露。毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”我们要警告苏联当局：真理是扼杀不了的，事实是掩盖不住的，世界人民是欺骗不了的，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国新闻工作者是任何暴力也吓不倒的。你们搬起石头只能打你们自己的脚。一切反华的家伙们决没有好下场！
    《人民日报》和新华通讯社严正声明：苏联当局必须保证中国记者人身安全和进行正常报道工作的一切条件。中国驻莫斯科记者一贯进行真实的报道，他们进行正常采访活动（包括拍摄新闻照片）的权利是不容剥夺的，苏联当局对中国记者的任何歧视措施都是不能接受的。如果你们一意孤行，由此引起的一切后果苏联政府必须承担全部责任。
