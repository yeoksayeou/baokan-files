Revolutionary rebels across the country, who are currently engaged in a comprehensive power seizure struggle, have been earnestly studying the basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the red rebels of Heilongjiang Province and the editorial published by the People's Daily. They unanimously point out that implementing the unity of the revolutionary masses, cadres, and the People's Liberation Army is the key to ensuring the victory of the current power seizure struggle.

Revolutionary rebel fighters from various places, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, unanimously declare: We must take the red rebels of Heilongjiang as our example, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and in this unprecedented power seizure struggle, forge ourselves into revolutionary pioneers who best represent the interests of the revolutionary masses, have the greatest political foresight, can best consider the overall situation, and can best implement and execute the policies of Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary rebel fighters from Nanjing, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hefei, Nanning, Kunming, and other places all believe, during their study and discussion, that "three-in-one combination, united seizure of power" is the core of the Heilongjiang experience. It most vividly embodies the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. Comrades from the Red Rebel Squad of Nanjing University pointed out that we must strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves, resolutely strike at the most reactionary forces, and unite with the genuine proletarian revolutionary rebels. Only in this way can we firmly grasp the power we have seized in our hands and complete the great historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. Fighters from the "Red Eagle" Combat Team of Lanzhou Medical College said that by firmly implementing the "three-in-one combination, united seizure of power," our ranks of red revolutionary rebels will grow stronger and stronger, and ultimate victory will surely be ours. Representatives from the Revolutionary Rebel United Committee of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, reflecting on their own struggle practice, said that only by implementing the "three-in-one combination" can we continually strengthen the leftist ranks, form a genuine great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and powerfully strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, truly seizing the real power over the Party, government, finance, and culture from their hands. Otherwise, even if we seize power, we will not be able to hold it, and if we hold it, we will not be able to consolidate it.

How can we truly implement the "three-in-one combination"? Many revolutionary rebel fighters from various places emphasized that the primary issue in implementing the "three-in-one combination" is to correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. Comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province said that in the power seizure struggle, we must strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves. We must take decisive measures to strike and completely seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. For those cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and who insist on not correcting their mistakes, we must definitely adopt Chairman Mao's consistent teachings of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity." For those cadres who stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must definitely rely on them and fight shoulder to shoulder with them. Many revolutionary rebel workers in Hangzhou said that for cadres who have made mistakes, we must distinguish between the size of the mistakes and the nature of the mistakes and not indiscriminately overthrow them. Only in this way can the proletarian revolutionary masses gain the support of the majority and stand unshakable. Workers from the October 27th Red Rebel Team in Xining, combining their unit's experience and lessons from the power seizure struggle, emphasized that in dealing with cadres, we must not adopt the approach of opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything. Such an approach would only please the class enemies. Comrade Chen Yonggui, Secretary of the Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, wrote that to implement the "three-in-one combination," revolutionary rebels must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, be good at distinguishing between good and bad cadres. We cannot think that all those in power should be unanimously overthrown and kicked aside. For those cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and who insist on not correcting their mistakes, we should adopt the attitude of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," strive to win them over, and unite with them. All revolutionary leading cadres must remove selfishness and杂念, believe in the masses, believe in the Party, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, and fight together with them to seize back all the great powers that have been monopolized by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Revolutionary rebels from various places pointed out that to implement the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses with the "three-in-one combination" as the core, we must resolutely oppose the erroneous idea of not distinguishing between right and wrong, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything, and thoroughly smash the enemy's new conspiracy to sabotage the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Comrades from the Revolutionary Rebel Team of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee believe that under the education and cultivation of Chairman Mao, after long-term struggle practice and tempering, there are many revolutionary leading cadres in the party and government organs of various places. The view that there are no genuine revolutionaries among the leading cadres is completely contrary to Mao Zedong Thought and is also completely inconsistent with objective reality. Red Guards from the Jingshan Brigade of Tsinghua University stationed in Nanchang said that currently, some comrades among the revolutionary rebels have been influenced by the "all those in power should step aside" fallacy, fearing that if they unite with those revolutionary leading cadres who, although they made some mistakes in the past, can correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they will be called "conservatives." They said, "overthrowing all those in power" is a new trick played by those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line to strike at the revolutionary leading cadres who insist on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, sabotage the great unity and power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels, and we revolutionary rebels must resolutely smash this new trick.

Many units of revolutionary rebels also reviewed their implementation of the "three-in-one combination" in the power seizure struggle by comparing with the experience of Heilongjiang. Revolutionary rebels from the Second Machine Tool Factory in Wuhan talked about how three revolutionary leading cadres, with the original Party Committee deputy secretary as the leader, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, supporting the revolutionary rebel workers in opposing the bourgeois reactionary line. Although they were labeled as "black commanders" and "black backstage figures," they still fought side by side with the revolutionary rebel workers against the bourgeois reactionary line. When the Cultural Revolution entered the new stage of power seizure, the revolutionary rebel workers united with these three revolutionary leading cadres to truly seize all the power in the factory back into the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses, making the entire factory present a new situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary rebels of this factory deeply felt that we must fight side by side with those revolutionary leading cadres who stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and unite and educate those cadres who have made general mistakes to return to the correct line. Revolutionary fighters from the Iron Alloy Factory in Chongqing talked about how they used Chairman Mao's class analysis method in the power seizure struggle to classify the cadres in the factory and treat them differently. They fought side by side with the genuine revolutionary leading cadres, united to seize power, and quickly established a new revolutionary order. The factory's average daily output increased by 18% compared to before the power seizure.

The fundamental experience of the Heilongjiang red rebels in arming the leftist ranks and guiding the power seizure struggle with Mao Zedong Thought has resonated strongly among the revolutionary rebel fighters in Wuhan, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Changsha, Chengdu, Shenyang, Urumqi, Nanjing, Baoding, and other places.

All members of the Red Flag Commune of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics believe that learning from the basic experience of the power seizure struggle by the Heilongjiang red rebels is fundamentally about learning from them how to arm the revolutionary leftist ranks with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. While transforming the objective world, we must also transform our subjective world, overthrow the "self," and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. Revolutionary rebels from the New China Printing Factory in Hubei Province talked about how, in this life-and-death class struggle, the most important thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self," and establish the "public." They also said that in the power seizure struggle, we used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overcome erroneous tendencies such as sectarianism and mountainism, uniting the eight revolutionary rebel organizations in the entire factory to form a revolutionary rebel army, and seizing various powers from the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. The responsible comrades of the "August 31st" Rebel Group Headquarters in Shenyang said that the experience created by the Heilongjiang red rebels in the power seizure struggle is a model of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and a good example for guiding our power seizure struggle.

Many revolutionary rebels from the Lanzhou Region Workers' United Combat Headquarters took the four basic experiences of the Heilongjiang red rebels' power seizure struggle as a mirror to examine themselves, feeling that they were not as good as their comrades in Heilongjiang in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the power seizure struggle. They all expressed their determination to seize the power of the "self" in their minds and let the "public" take charge, striving to complete the great unity and great power seizure task in Gansu Province. The young Red Guards in Urumqi emphasized that to truly learn from the good experience of Heilongjiang Province, we must first open fire on the "self." If there are erroneous tendencies such as sectarianism and windism, it will be impossible to successfully carry out great unity and power seizure struggles.

    各地革命造反派认真学习黑龙江红色造反者夺权经验和《人民日报》社论
    实行“三结合”是保证夺权斗争取得胜利的关键
    一致表示：要以黑龙江的红色造反者为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在夺权斗争中，把自己锻炼成为最能代表革命群众利益，最有政治远见，最能顾全大局，最能贯彻执行毛主席的方针政策的革命闯将。
    据新华社十一日讯　正在全面展开夺权斗争的全国各地广大革命造反派，在认真学习黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验和《人民日报》为此发表的社论时纷纷指出：实行以“三结合”为核心的无产阶级革命派大联合，严格区分敌友我，正确贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席的干部政策，这是保证当前夺权斗争取得胜利的关键。
    各地革命造反派的战士们满怀革命豪情，一致表示：一定要以黑龙江的红色造反者为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在史无前例的夺权斗争中，把自己锻炼成为最能代表革命群众利益，最有政治远见，最能顾全大局，最能贯彻执行毛主席的方针政策的革命闯将。
    南京、兰州、广州、合肥、南宁、昆明等地广大革命造反派战士在学习和讨论中都认为，“三位一体，联合夺权”，这是黑龙江经验的核心，它最鲜明地体现了我们伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导。南京大学红色造反队的同志们指出，我们只有严格区分敌友我的界限，坚决打击最顽固的反动力量，联合真正的无产阶级革命造反派，才能把已夺得的政权牢牢地掌握在我们革命造反派手中，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史使命。兰州医学院“红鹰”战斗团的战士说，坚定不移地实行“三位一体，联合夺权”，我们红色革命造反派的队伍就越来越壮大，最后胜利一定属于我们。中共广东省委机关革命造反联合委员会的代表在回顾自己的斗争实践时说，只有实行“三结合”，才能不断壮大左派队伍，形成真正的无产阶级革命派的大联合，才能有力地打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从他们的手里真正夺得党、政、财、文的实权。不然的话，就是夺了权也掌不了权，掌了权也不能巩固。
    怎样才能实行真正的“三结合”？各地许多革命造反派战士都强调指出，要实行“三结合”，首要的问题是正确贯彻毛主席的干部政策。红色造反者吉林省革命委员会的同志们说，在夺权斗争中要严格区分敌友我的界限，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，采取坚决打击、彻底夺权的措施，而对那些犯有错误的干部，只要他们不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就一定要采取毛主席一贯教导的“惩前毖后，治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针。对站在毛主席革命路线一边的干部，一定要坚决依靠，并肩战斗。杭州市许多革命造反派工人在学习和座谈黑龙江的经验时说，对犯有错误的干部，一定要分清错误的大小和错误的性质，不能一概打倒。只有这样，才能使无产阶级革命派取得大多数人的拥护，使自己立于不败之地。西宁市一○·二七红色造反团的工人同志们结合本单位夺权斗争的经验和教训着重谈到，对待干部绝不能采取反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的做法，这样做，只有阶级敌人才高兴。山西昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵写文章说：为了搞好“三结合”，革命造反派要按照毛主席的教导，善于区别好干部和坏干部，不能认为凡是当权派就一律打倒，就一脚踢开。对于那些犯有错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就应采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度，争取他们，团结他们。一切革命的领导干部，要除掉私心杂念，相信群众，相信党，坚定地站到毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决站在革命造反派一边，和他们共同战斗，把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所把持的大权统统夺回来。
    各地革命造反派指出，要实行以“三结合”为核心的无产阶级革命派大联合，必须坚决反对那种不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的错误思想，彻底粉碎敌人破坏无产阶级革命派大联合的新阴谋。江西省委机关革命造反团的同志们认为，在毛主席的教育培养下，经过长期斗争实践的锻炼和考验，各地党政机关有大量的革命领导干部。那种认为领导干部中没有一个真正革命者的看法，是完全违背毛泽东思想的，也是根本不符合客观实际的。清华大学井冈山兵团驻南昌联络站的红卫兵战士们说，目前革命造反派有些同志受到“一切当权派统统靠边站”的形
  “左”实右的论调的影响，不敢团结那些过去虽犯过一些错误，但能够认识错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来的革命领导干部，怕因为团结那些革命领导干部而被人说是“保”。他们说，“打倒一切当权派”是顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人玩弄的一个新阴谋，这些家伙借此来打击坚持毛主席革命路线的革命领导干部，破坏革命造反派的大联合和夺权斗争，我们革命造反派一定要坚决粉碎这个新阴谋。
    许多单位的革命造反派还对照黑龙江的经验，在学习和讨论中回顾了他们在夺权斗争中实行“三结合”的情况。武汉市第二机床厂的革命造反派谈到，这个厂以原党委副书记为首的三个革命领导干部，在文化大革命初期就坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，支持革命造反派工人反对资产阶级反动路线。尽管他们被打成“黑司令”、“黑后台”，但他们仍然与革命造反派工人一道同资产阶级反动路线作坚决斗争。在文化大革命进入夺权斗争新阶段的时候，革命造反派工人团结这三位革命领导干部，一道把全厂一切权力真正夺回到无产阶级革命派的手中，使全厂出现了抓革命、促生产的崭新局面。这个厂的革命造反派深有体会地说，我们一定要和那些站在毛主席革命路线一边的革命领导干部并肩战斗，并且团结教育那些犯有一般错误的干部回到正确路线上来。重庆铁合金厂的革命造反派战士们谈到，他们在夺权斗争中运用毛主席的阶级分析方法，对厂里的干部进行了排队，区别对待。他们和真正革命的领导干部并肩战斗，联合夺权，很快建立了革命的新秩序，厂里的平均日产量比夺权前提高了百分之十八。
    黑龙江红色造反者坚持用毛泽东思想武装左派队伍和指导夺权斗争的根本经验，在武汉、兰州、西安、长沙、成都、沈阳、乌鲁木齐、南京、保定等地的革命造反派战士中引起了强烈的共鸣。
    南京航空学院红旗公社全体战士认为，学习黑龙江红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验，最根本的是要学习他们用伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想来武装革命左派队伍，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，打倒“私”字，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。湖北省新华印刷厂革命造反派谈到，在这场你死我活的阶级大搏斗中，最最重要的是活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。他们还说，在夺权斗争中，我们以毛泽东思想为武器，克服了小团体主义、山头主义等等错误思想倾向，使全厂八个革命造反组织联合起来，形成了一支革命造反大军，从一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺回了各种大权。毛泽东思想“八·三一”造反团沈阳总部的负责人说，黑龙江省红色造反者在夺权斗争中创造的经验，是活学活用毛泽东思想的一个典范，是指导我们夺权斗争的一个好样板。
    兰州地区工人联合战斗总部的许多革命造反者把黑龙江红色造反者夺权斗争的四条基本经验当作镜子对照自己，觉得自己在夺权斗争中活学活用毛主席著作不如黑龙江的战友，纷纷表示要夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，让“公”字当家，为胜利完成甘肃省的大联合、大夺权的任务而奋斗。乌鲁木齐市的红卫兵小将们着重谈到，要把黑龙江省的好经验学到手，必须先向“私”字开火。有山头主义、风头主义等错误思想，就不可能胜利地进行大联合和夺权斗争。
