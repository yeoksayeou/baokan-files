The Vietnamese National Liberation Front's order to halt military attacks for seven days during the Lunar New Year and the statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 28, 1967, in response to a reporter's question, have been warmly welcomed and supported by governments and peace-loving people around the world. Public opinion demands that the United States must respond to the National Liberation Front's order to halt military attacks and must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war.

In this situation, American imperialism is extremely embarrassed but remains very stubborn. On the surface, it agrees to a four-day ceasefire during the Lunar New Year, but in reality, it is doing everything it can to sabotage it: during these four days, U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops continued to launch multiple attacks and "sweeps" in South Vietnam, and U.S. planes continued to violate the North. The four U.S. planes shot down in the North on the afternoon of the 29th and the 4th day of the Lunar New Year are proof of this.

To further divert and distract public opinion, the United States is also using the trick of "temporarily extending the halt of bombing" in the North for a short period of time, "to await Hanoi's response." It is clear that this is an arrogant demand by the United States for the Vietnamese people to accept negotiations on American terms. However, the American aggressors are greatly mistaken! The Vietnamese people will never yield to force. American imperialism should not dream of intimidating the Vietnamese people with bombs!

The farce of "temporarily extending the halt of bombing" has only been going on for two days when U.S. President Johnson announced that the war would "continue with the appropriate procedures." This clearly exposes his plot to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam and achieve a new "escalation" in the North. On the morning of February 14, 1967, U.S. planes once again savagely attacked many areas of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is an extremely serious provocation to the people of the world. Many governments, many political activists, and peace-loving people from the five continents, including people from various strata in the United States, have expressed great indignation at the United States' resumption of bombing in North Vietnam.

The United States wants to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people will certainly give it the appropriate response.

In a reply to Pope Paul VI, Chairman Ho reiterated:

"To defend independence and peace, the Vietnamese people resolutely resist aggression and firmly believe that justice will prevail.

"The United States must stop its aggression against Vietnam, permanently and unconditionally halt bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all acts of war, withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam, recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs. Only in this way can true peace be restored in Vietnam."

The U.S. aggressors are now in unprecedented isolation. Since they refuse to submit to the truth, they will inevitably suffer a heavy defeat.

### 越外交部发言人揭露美帝国主义的新阴谋  越南人民决不会在武力面前屈服

    越外交部发言人揭露美帝国主义的新阴谋
    越南人民决不会在武力面前屈服
    新华社河内十六日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人十五日发表了一项声明，全文如下：
    越南南方民族解放阵线在春节期间停止军事进攻七天的命令和越南民主共和国外交部长一九六七年一月二十八日答记者贝却敌问，得到各国政府和全世界热爱和平人民的热烈欢迎和支持。舆论要求美国必须响应民族解放阵线的停止军事进攻令，必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动。
    在这种情况下，美帝国主义非常狼狈，但仍然十分顽固。表面上，它同意在春节停火四天，但在实际上，却千方百计地进行破坏：在这四天里，美军、伪军和帮凶军仍然在越南南方发动多次进攻和“扫荡”，美国飞机仍然不断侵犯北方。农历二十九日下午和大年初四在北方击落的四架美国飞机就是证明。
    为了进一步缓和和转移舆论的视线，美国还玩弄在一段短时间里“暂时延长停止轰炸”北方的欺骗手段，“来等待河内的响应”。很明显，这是美国蛮横地要求越南人民必须按照美国的条件接受谈判的最后通牒。但是，美国侵略者大错特错了！越南人民决不会在武力面前屈服。美帝国主义不要妄想用炸弹恫吓越南人民！
      “暂时延长停止轰炸”的丑剧刚刚上演了两天，美国总统约翰逊就宣布“以应有的程序继续进行战争”，这清楚地暴露了他加强侵略越南战争、在北方实现新的“升级”的阴谋。一九六七年二月十四日上午，美国飞机又野蛮袭击越南民主共和国领土上的许多地区。这是对全世界人民的极其严重的挑衅。许多政府，许多政治活动家和五大洲的爱好和平的人民，包括美国各阶层人民，对美国恢复轰炸越南北方表示极大的愤慨。
    美国要加强侵略越南的战争，越南人民必将给它以应有的回答。
    胡主席在给教皇保罗六世的复电中重申：
    “为了保卫独立与和平，越南人民坚决抵抗侵略，并且坚信正义一定胜利。
      “美帝国主义必须停止侵略越南，永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和一切战争行动，把美国军队和仆从军队全部撤出越南南方，承认越南南方民族解放阵线，让越南人民自己解决自己的内部事务。只有这样，在越南的真正和平才能恢复。”
    美国侵略者正在陷于空前的孤立。它既然不肯服从真理，就必将遭到惨重的失败。
