	Tokyo, February 7 (New China News Agency) — The Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee of Japan issued a statement today condemning the Soviet revisionists' plot to hold a so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting in Cyprus and formally announced its refusal to attend the meeting.

	The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have always sabotaged the cause of Asian-African people's solidarity against imperialism and split the Asian-African people's solidarity movement. Now they are plotting to hold a so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting in Cyprus, attempting to sabotage the resolution passed at the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Winnipeg, which decided to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing in 1967.

	The statement said that the meeting plotted by the Soviet revisionists is completely aimed at splitting and sabotaging the Asian-African people's solidarity movement. It is a traitorous act to sell out the revolutionary Asian-African people to American imperialism.

	The statement expressed firm support for the resolution passed at the Winnipeg Conference to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing and pledged to do everything possible to ensure its success.

	The statement concluded, "We are convinced that the Beijing Conference will smash all the conspiracies of the imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists and make a contribution to the cause of the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace."

	Colombo, February 6 (New China News Agency) — The Asian-African Solidarity Association of Ceylon protested against the plot by the Soviet revisionist leadership to hold a so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting in Cyprus in February. The association pointed out that this council meeting is "completely illegal and the decisions made at the meeting are not binding on the member countries of the organization."

	The protest was made in a letter dated February 3 to the General Secretary of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo.

	The letter said, "Such actions will only serve to weaken the Asian-African people's solidarity against imperialism."

	The letter said that the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winnipeg unanimously decided to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing in 1967.

	The letter emphasized, "The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is the highest organ of this organization, and its decisions cannot be changed by the council or the Cairo Secretariat."

	Bangkok, February 4 (New China News Agency) — The Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee of Thailand sent a telegram to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization Secretariat in Cairo on February 3, saying, "We firmly support the Winnipeg resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year."

	The telegram said, "We strongly oppose and protest against any meeting that violates the Winnipeg resolution of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, because such a meeting is aimed at sabotaging Asian-African solidarity and serving the interests of American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys."

	"The February meeting in Nicosia is serving the splitist conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists. We refuse to participate. Those who preside over the meeting will be responsible for all harmful consequences."

    日锡泰等国亚非团结会谴责苏修集团的分裂阴谋
    第五届亚非人民团结大会必须在北京举行
    新华社七日讯　东京消息：亚非人民团结日本委员会七日发表声明，谴责苏联修正主义者策划在塞浦路斯召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，并正式宣布拒绝出席这个会议。
    声明指出，苏联修正主义者，一贯破坏亚非人民团结反帝事业，分裂亚非人民团结运动。他们现在又策划在塞浦路斯召开所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，企图破坏温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会的决议。
    声明说，苏联修正主义者策划的这个会议，完全是为了分裂和破坏亚非人民团结运动，是把革命的亚非人民出卖给美帝国主义的一种叛徒行为。
    声明表示坚决支持在温尼巴大会上所通过的关于在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议，并竭尽全力为其成功而努力。
    声明最后说，“我们深信：北京大会必将粉碎帝国主义者、反动派和现代修正主义者的各种阴谋，并为促进日本人民争取独立、民主、和平事业作出贡献。”
    新华社科伦坡六日电锡兰亚非团结协会抗议苏联修正主义领导集团策划将于二月在塞浦路斯召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会，并且指出：这个理事会会议“是完全非法的，理事会会议通过的决定对这个组织的成员国没有约束力。”
    抗议是在二月三日给在开罗的亚非人民团结组织书记处总书记的信中提出的。
    信件说：“这种行动只会起到削弱亚非人民团结反帝的作用。”
    信件说，在温尼巴举行的第四届亚非人民团结大会一致决定，一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会。
    信件强调指出：“亚非人民团结组织大会是这个组织的最高机构，它通过的决定不是理事会或开罗的书记处改变得了的。”
    新华社四日讯　泰国亚非人民团结委员会三日在给开罗亚非人民团结组织书记处的一份电报中说：“我们坚决支持第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的温尼巴决议。”
    电报说：“我们强烈反对和抗议违反亚非人民团结大会温尼巴决议的任何会议，因为这种会议是破坏亚非团结和为美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者及其走狗们效劳的。
    “二月份举行的尼科西亚会议是为苏联修正主义者的分裂阴谋服务的。我们拒绝参加。主持会议的那些人要对一切有害的结果负责。”
