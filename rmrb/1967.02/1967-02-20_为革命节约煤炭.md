Shanghai Daily Chemical Products Factory's revolutionary rebels, after seizing power, reversed the chaotic situation created by a handful of bad elements and took various measures to save a large amount of coal for production and daily life.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, on the 19th, after seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers of Shanghai Daily Chemical Products Factory have been earnestly carrying out Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "save to make revolution." They have been doing everything possible to save coal for the state. In January, the factory overfulfilled its production plan by 2.5 percent, while the coal consumption was reduced by 25 percent compared to the previous month. In the first half of February, production increased by 15.89 percent compared to the same period in January, and coal consumption was further reduced by 10.3 percent.

Some time ago, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and diehard elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line in this factory directed their struggle against the revolutionary masses, seriously undermining the initiative of the revolutionary masses. After their plots were exposed, they spread a counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism, causing serious chaos in the factory's production. The original measures for saving coal were stopped; the suggestions for saving coal made by the boiler workers were ignored, and the coal consumption of the entire factory could not be reduced. In the storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionary factions in the factory seized power from the capitalist-roaders. Under the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary factions, all revolutionary workers in the factory grasped revolution with one hand and production with the other. The revolutionary organizations also put the issue of saving coal on the production agenda and studied measures for saving coal with the boiler workers several times.

The proletarian revolutionary factions recognized that saving coal is a very important task in the current "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary factions among the boiler workers said: Now that we have seized power, if we do not save coal, who will? They repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" (Quotations from Chairman Mao), removed the "self" from their minds, and were not afraid of hard work or trouble. When adding coal, they always did so carefully, bit by bit, and also picked out the unburned coal from the ashes to burn again. They also tried every means to find garbage, oil residue, waste oil felt, and other burnable waste materials to burn together with the coal.

The proletarian revolutionary workers of this factory also gradually reduced the amount of coal used for daily life. The comrades in the canteen saved 700 jin (approximately 350 kilograms) of coal in one month. The coal used for boiling water in various workshops was also saved compared to the past. The heating coal distributed to the workshops was not easily burned, and the saved coal was returned to the factory.

    为革命节约煤炭
    上海日用化学品四厂革命造反派夺权后，扭转过去一小撮坏家伙制造的混乱局面，采取各种措施，节约大量生产和生活用煤
    据新华社上海十九日电　上海日用化学品四厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工在夺权以后，认真执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，尽一切努力为国家节约煤炭。一月份这个厂超额百分之二点五完成了生产计划，煤炭耗用量反比上一个月降低百分之二十五；二月上半月产量比一月份同期增长百分之十五点八九，煤耗又下降百分之十点三。
    前些时候，这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，把斗争矛头指向革命群众，严重地打击了革命群众的积极性。他们的阴谋被揭穿以后，又大刮反革命经济主义妖风，使全厂生产发生严重混乱。原来的节约用煤措施停下来了；司炉工人提出的节约用煤建议他们也置之不理，全厂的耗煤量一直无法降低。在“一月革命”的风暴中，厂里的无产阶级革命派夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权。在无产阶级革命派同志们的带动下，全厂革命职工一手抓革命，一手抓生产。革命组织还把节约用煤的问题提到生产日程上来，多次和司炉工一起研究节约用煤的措施。
    无产阶级革命派同志认识到，在当前“抓革命，促生产”中，节约煤炭是个十分重要的工作。司炉工中的革命派说：现在我们掌了权，我们不节约煤炭，谁节约？他们反复学习了“老三篇”，去掉自己脑子里的“私”字，不怕苦，不怕麻烦，加煤的时候总是小心地一点点加，还在烧过的煤渣中挑出没烧透的来再烧。他们还千方百计去找垃圾、油脚、废油毛毡等可以烧的废物，夹在煤里一起烧。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派职工，还逐渐降低了生活用煤量。食堂的同志一个月就节省了七百斤煤。各车间烧开水用的煤也比过去省。分发给车间的取暖煤，大家都不轻易烧，节省下来退给厂里。
