During the Cultural Revolution, the class consciousness of the revolutionary workers in our factory has significantly improved. This year, our support for agricultural production has been very enthusiastic. Everyone says: "We must respond to Chairman Mao's call with concrete actions, seize the revolution, and promote production vigorously." In January of this year, our factory's production was the best in the past four years. The entire month produced fifty water pumps, which have been allocated to nine counties in our region. Additionally, eight rice hullers, over six hundred meters of water pipes, and a batch of tractor plows were produced to support spring plowing. The quality of the products is also better than in previous years.

In the process of supporting agriculture, we have engaged in fierce struggles with the power-holders in our factory who were taking the capitalist road. Initially, they used "focus on production" to suppress the revolution. Later, they simply lay down and did not manage production, even pushing away agricultural machinery sent by farmers for repair. They also spread the wind of economism, arbitrarily increasing workers' wages and inciting some workers to leave their production posts. However, all these plots were smashed by us. We revolutionary workers have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. We will firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call and support agriculture with all our might, striving for a bumper harvest this year.

    用实际行动响应毛主席的号召
    在文化大革命中，我厂革命职工的阶级觉悟得到很大提高，今年支援农业生产的工作搞得热气腾腾，大家说：“我们一定要以实际行动响应毛主席的号召，大抓革命，狠促生产。”今年一月份，我厂的生产情况是近四年来最好的一个月，全月共生产了五十台水轮泵，已分配给本专区的九个县。另外还生产了八台轧米机，六百多米水管和一批拖拉机犁铲，支援了春耕。产品质量也比往年好。
    我们在支援农业的过程中，曾经和我厂走资本主义道路的当权派进行了激烈的斗争。最初，他们用“抓生产”来压革命，后来干脆躺倒，不管生产，甚至把农民送来修理的农业机械推掉不修。他们还刮起经济主义的妖风，给工人乱加工资，鼓动一些工人离开生产岗位。但是，这些阴谋都被我们一一粉碎了。我们革命工人心最红，眼最亮。我们坚决响应毛主席的号召，一定要以最大的力量支援农业，争取今年农业生产的丰收。
