	In Britain, an increasing number of people are studying the works of Chairman Mao and are using the principles of Marxism-Leninism, as expounded by Mao, "as a beacon to arm themselves and prepare for fierce struggles against the British capitalists who are the running dogs of American imperialism." Under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will advance to victory and achieve final triumph. This struggle is also our struggle. Your struggle is helping us move forward.

    用毛泽东思想武装自己
    在英国，越来越多的人正在学习毛主席著作，并把毛主席阐明的马克思列宁主义原则“作为指路明灯，武装自己，准备同美帝国主义的帮凶英国资本主义进行激烈的斗争。”在毛主席的英明正确的领导下，中国的无产阶级文化大革命将胜利前进，并赢得最后胜利。这场斗争也是我们的斗争。你们的斗争正在帮助我们前进。
        英国一些朋友
