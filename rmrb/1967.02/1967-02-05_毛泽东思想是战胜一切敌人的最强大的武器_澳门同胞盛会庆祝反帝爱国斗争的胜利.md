Mao Zedong Thought is the Most Powerful Weapon to Defeat All Enemies
Macau Compatriots Hold Grand Rally to Celebrate Victory in Anti-Imperialist, Patriotic Struggle

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, February 4th – Under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Macau compatriots bravely fought against the Portuguese colonialists, forcing the Macau authorities to admit their crimes. On the 3rd, with revolutionary fervor, they held a grand rally at the Macau Workers' Stadium to celebrate the brilliant victory of their anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle.

The sky was clear and sunny, with bright sunlight bathing the earth. Wearing Mao badges and holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Macau workers, peasants, students, women, and people from all walks of life marched into the stadium in neat rows, full of spirit and determination. The stage was adorned with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, countless red flags fluttered in the wind, and thousands of Mao quotes shimmered in the sunlight.

At 1:00 PM, the rally began amidst enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause. Over ten thousand people sang "The East Is Red" with fervor, holding up their red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and reciting in unison:

"The core of our leadership is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

"All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true strength does not lie with the reactionaries but with the people."

The rally unanimously adopted a telegram of greeting to the most, most, most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Amidst warm applause, the rally chairman Liang Pei and representatives from workers, students, the sanctions group, and various sectors spoke. They said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our most reliable and fundamental guarantee of victory. Today, our hearts fly to Beijing, to Tiananmen Square, to pay tribute to our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

They said, "Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory' have given us boundless strength to defeat the enemy. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilized the masses, united over ninety percent of our compatriots, and engaged in a head-on struggle with the enemy. We used Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and a microscope, seeing clearly and exposing the tricks and schemes of the Portuguese colonialists, forcing Governor Macao to admit his crimes."

They warned the Macau authorities: "You must honestly and fully implement your promises. If there is any hesitation, we will not be lenient."

They warned the Kuomintang remnants: "If you do not change your ways and continue to oppose the motherland, you will meet your doom."

Chen Yucai, the leader of the delegation from various sectors in Hong Kong who came specially to attend the celebration, said: "The struggles in Hong Kong and Macau are closely linked. We share the same fate and breathe the same air. Together, we fight together. The victory of Macau compatriots is our victory. Hong Kong compatriots will learn from the valuable experience of Macau compatriots in using Mao Zedong Thought in their struggles. Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!"

During Chen Yucai's speech, the crowd repeatedly shouted, "Long live the great unity of Hong Kong and Macau compatriots in the anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle!"

Representatives from various sectors in Macau and Hong Kong spoke out in anger, condemning the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists against our students in Europe. They pointed out that this horrifying massacre once again fully exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership's deep-seated hatred and great fear of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought and our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the world's revolutionary people love Mao Zedong Thought immensely, and the influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be stopped by the likes of Brezhnev and Kosygin. The Soviet people will not tolerate the dark rule of this small group of scoundrels in the Soviet revisionist leadership for long. The Soviet people will surely rise up, revolt against them, overthrow them, and seize power, letting Lenin and Stalin's homeland return to the path of socialism.

After the rally, Macau workers and students, along with representatives from various sectors in Hong Kong, performed many artistic programs full of fighting spirit and revolutionary passion.

    毛泽东思想是战胜一切敌人的最强大的武器
    澳门同胞盛会庆祝反帝爱国斗争的胜利
    新华社香港四日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗同澳葡帝国主义者进行英勇斗争，迫使澳葡当局低头认罪的澳门同胞，三日满怀革命豪情，在澳门工人体育场举行了万人大会，庆祝反帝爱国斗争的光辉胜利。
    当天，晴空万里，灿烂的阳光普照大地。胸前别着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》的澳门工人、农民、师生、妇女和各界同胞，意气风发，斗志昂扬，排着整齐的队伍从四面八方进入会场。会场主席台上高悬着毛主席的巨幅画像，数不清的红旗迎风飘扬，成千的毛主席语录牌发出耀眼的金光。
    下午一时，大会在热烈的欢呼声和暴风雨般的掌声中开始。一万多人纵情高唱《东方红》，他们手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读：
      “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
      “一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    大会一致通过了给最最最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    在热烈的掌声中，大会主席梁培和工人、学生、制裁小组、各界同胞代表讲了话。他们说，毛泽东思想是我们取得胜利的最可靠最根本的保证。今天，我们的心飞向北京，飞向天安门，向我们伟大的领袖毛主席致敬！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    他们说，毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”给了我们战胜敌人的无穷力量。我们照毛主席的指示办事，发动群众，团结百分之九十以上的同胞，同敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争。我们用毛泽东思想作望远镜、显微镜，心明眼亮，及时拆穿了澳葡帝国主义者的阴谋诡计，迫使嘉乐庇低头认罪。
    他们警告澳葡当局：“你们必须老老实实全部彻底实现你们的诺言，如果有半个不字，我们决不客气。”
    他们警告蒋帮分子：“你们如果不弃暗投明，改过自新，而继续与祖国为敌，你们就死无葬身之地。”
    专程前来参加庆祝大会的香港各界同胞代表团团长、港九工会联合会会长陈耀材在讲话中说：“香港和澳门的斗争是紧紧相连的。我们同命运，共呼吸，团结在一起，斗争在一起，澳门同胞的胜利，也就是我们的胜利。香港同胞学习澳门同胞在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的宝贵经验，互相手挽手，肩并肩，高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进！”在陈耀材讲话时，人们不断高呼：“港澳同胞反帝爱国大团结万岁！”
    澳门和香港各界同胞代表在讲话中愤怒谴责苏修毒打我留欧学生的法西斯暴行。他们指出，这一骇人听闻的血案，又一次彻底地暴露了苏修领导集团对伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对我国无产阶级文化大革命的刻骨仇恨和极大恐惧。但是，世界革命人民无比热爱毛泽东思想，我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，决不是勃列日涅夫、柯西金这些历史垃圾所能阻挡的。苏联人民决不会长期忍受苏修领导集团这一小撮坏家伙的黑暗统治，苏联人民一定会起来造他们的反，革他们的命，夺他们的权，让列宁、斯大林的故乡，重新走上社会主义的大道。
    大会结束后，澳门工人和学生以及香港各界同胞演出了许多充满战斗和革命激情的文艺节目。
