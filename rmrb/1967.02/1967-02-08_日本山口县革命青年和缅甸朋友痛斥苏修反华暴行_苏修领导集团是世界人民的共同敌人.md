Tokyo, February 7 (Xinhua) — About 500 revolutionary youth, students, and women from Yamaguchi Prefecture held a rally in Yamaguchi City on February 5 to strongly protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership in Moscow against Chinese students studying in Europe. They also expressed their determination to strive for the success of the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival.

The rally was filled with red flags and a spirited atmosphere. The participants waved placards with slogans such as: "Study and apply the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!" "Smash revisionism!"

The rally, amid thunderous applause, adopted a message of solidarity to Chinese students studying in Europe. The telegram said, "Chinese comrades have bravely stood up to the suppression by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership and given them a taste of their own medicine. We, the broad masses of youth and people in Yamaguchi Prefecture, warmly support the revolutionary actions of our Chinese comrades and strongly condemn the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists."

The telegram continued, "The more the U.S. imperialists, Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionists, and their old and new followers attack the peoples of China and Japan, the more it proves that they are not strong but weak. The more blatant their attacks, the more united we become. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people.' Let us unite in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, dare to fight and dare to win against our common enemy!"

YANGON, February 7 (Xinhua) — Friends from Burma have strongly condemned the savage atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Chinese students and diplomatic personnel. They chanted slogans such as: "Down with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the world revolution!"

Two Burmese workers wrote a letter to a Xinhua reporter saying, "The repeated atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Chinese students and diplomatic personnel once again undeniably prove that the Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We can clearly see that the Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified of the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and hates it deeply."

The letter stated, "As Chairman Mao's poem says: 'Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and wolves.' The Soviet revisionists will not have a good ending. These traitors must pay for the blood debts they owe. The Soviet revisionist leadership will be defeated! Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will be victorious!"

A Burmese youth cultural worker recently wrote an article stating: "The Soviet revisionist leadership, by acting as an international enforcer, has exposed its weakness and desperate struggle. 'It is lifting a stone only to drop it on its own feet.'"

He pointed out: "Including the Soviet people, the people of the world will increasingly see that modern revisionism, centered around the Soviet leadership, is their common and mortal enemy. It is a treacherous, shameful, and vicious traitor to the cause of national liberation, people's democracy, world peace, and social progress. It walks the same path as imperialism and reactionaries in various countries. Of course, it poses a more direct danger because it can play a role that imperialism and reactionaries cannot. Modern revisionism is wreaking havoc on the people of the world, including our country. Therefore, the people of the world have come to a clear conclusion: if we do not oppose modern revisionism, it is impossible to oppose imperialism. To oppose imperialism, we must oppose modern revisionism. Those who want to take the path of compromise, the middle road, and those who want to be spectators are impossible. This is the historical task facing the people of the world today."

    日本山口县革命青年和缅甸朋友痛斥苏修反华暴行
    苏修领导集团是世界人民的共同敌人
    据新华社七日讯　东京消息：日本山口县的革命青年、学生和妇女约五百人五日在山口市举行大会，强烈抗议苏联现代修正主义领导集团在莫斯科野蛮殴打中国留欧学生的法西斯暴行，同时表示决心为实现第二届日中青年友好大联欢而奋斗。
    会场上红旗招展，与会者斗志昂扬。人们挥动着的标语牌上写着：“活学活用马克思列宁主义的最高峰毛泽东思想！”“伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“粉碎修正主义！”
    大会在雷动般掌声中通过了给中国留欧学生的慰问电。电报说，中国朋友们面对苏联现代修正主义领导集团的镇压大义凛然地坚持了革命行动，把他们那一套顶了回去。我们山口县的广大青年和人民热烈支持中国朋友们的革命行动，最强烈地谴责苏修的法西斯暴行。
    电报说，美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其新旧追随者越是对日中两国人民进攻，就越证明他们不是强大而是虚弱。他们的进攻越露骨，我们的团结就越巩固。毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”让我们用无产阶级国际主义的精神团结起来，对共同的敌人敢于斗争，敢于胜利吧！
    新华社仰光七日电缅甸朋友最强烈地谴责苏联修正主义领导集团对中国留学生和外交人员的野蛮暴行。他们高呼：“打倒苏修统治集团！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”“世界革命万岁！”
    两位缅甸工人写信给新华社记者说，“苏修领导集团对中国学生和外交人员一再犯下的暴行又一次无可否认地证明，苏修领导集团背叛了马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义。我们可以清楚地看到，苏修领导集团对毛泽东思想的传播怕得要死，十分痛恨。”
    信件写道，“正如毛主席的诗所说的：‘独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。’苏修决不会有好下场。这些叛徒必须偿还他们欠下的血债。苏修领导集团必败！马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想必胜！”
    一位缅甸青年文艺工作者最近发表文章说：苏修领导集团“充当国际打手，就暴露了它的脆弱和垂死挣扎。”“它是在搬起石头砸自己的脚。”
    他指出：“包括苏联人民在内的全世界人民，将越来越清楚地看到，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义是他们共同的凶恶的不共戴天的敌人。它是争取民族解放、人民民主、世界和平和社会进步的世界人民事业的卑鄙的、可耻的和恶毒的叛徒。它是同帝国主义和各国反动派走着同一条路。当然，它具有更加直接的危险，因为它能够起帝国主义和反动派所不能起到的恶毒的作用。现代修正主义在到处对包括我国人民在内的世界人民为非作歹。因此，全世界人民已经得出了明确的结论：如果不反对现代修正主义，要反对帝国主义是不可能的。要反对帝国主义，必须反对现代修正主义。想走妥协的道路、中间道路和充当观潮派都是不可能的。这是今天全世界人民面临的历史任务。”
