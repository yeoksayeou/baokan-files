The Cultural Revolution in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province is unfolding in a magnificent and vigorous manner. The revolutionary rebels have broken through layer upon layer of obstacles and emerged victorious. The situation is excellent! We, the revolutionary comrades on the agricultural front, must recognize that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The success or failure of agricultural production directly affects the national economy and the livelihood of the people, as well as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. Therefore, we revolutionary rebels, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." We must channel the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm ignited by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. At present, we must immediately beat the drums for the spring farming production campaign and launch a new high tide of spring farming production.

Revolutionary leaders at all levels in the countryside must step forward and go to the front lines of spring farming production. We, the revolutionary rebels among the poor and lower-middle peasants, must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of primary importance in revolution." We must strictly distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society are stirring up trouble, attacking revolutionary cadres, disrupting collective production, and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. They are also playing tricks in the layout of crops, variety arrangements, and field management of summer crops, as well as in the allocation of labor and work points. We, the revolutionary rebels among the poor and lower-middle peasants, must expose their various tricks at any time, give them a powerful counterattack, and unite with the genuine revolutionary cadres. We must organize the vast masses of revolutionary people and form a mighty production army. The communes, production brigades, and production teams must establish leadership teams for production. Where the production leadership teams are paralyzed, we revolutionary rebels must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching, "The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" Bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants who have production experience, organize teams to grasp revolution and promote production, and lead the spring farming production well.

Now, the spring has arrived, and the busy spring farming season is about to begin. We must seize the opportunity and not miss it. The most urgent task at present is to strengthen the field management of summer crops and make early preparations for various spring farming tasks. Below are some of my views on these two aspects.

1. Strengthen the management of summer crops and green manure. To achieve victory in agricultural production in 1967, we must first win the battle for a bumper harvest of summer crops. Three parts sowing, seven parts management. The current period is the critical time for the field management of summer crops, and we must grasp it and carry it out.

At present, the three cereals and rapeseed in Jiangsu Province are gradually turning green. This is the critical period for achieving a high yield of three cereals with more and larger ears and rapeseed with strong vines and more branches. We must grasp four tasks: First, vigorously promote the greening of three cereals and apply heavy spring fertilizer to rapeseed. For those with less base fertilizer and winter fertilizer and yellow seedlings, we must grasp it tightly and apply more to promote early growth. Second, timely dredge ditches and ridges to ensure that ditches are connected and water has a way out. Third, weeding, intertilling, and earthing up. For row-sown wheat fields, weeding and intertilling should be combined with fertilization once; for alkali-saline soil areas, intertilling should be done well to prevent salinization. Rapeseed generally needs to be loosened two to three times, following the principle of shallow, deep, shallow. Through intertilling, we can achieve the goals of weed control, ventilation, moisture retention, and root strengthening. Fourth, prepare pesticides and tools for disease and pest control. This year's green manure must be specially managed in the field to increase the fresh grass yield by all means. Now that the spring has passed, the weather is gradually warming up, and the overwintering duckweed must be managed to promote reproduction.

2. Make good preparations for various spring farming tasks.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not fight a battle without preparation, do not fight a battle without assurance, and every battle should be fought with preparation." Agricultural production is a battle against nature. To achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn of 1967, we must start preparing now.

Arrange the layout of crop production well. This is a major task that affects the entire year's production. It not only affects the production of a commune or brigade but also the entire national economic plan. Many communes and brigades have made preliminary arrangements for this year's production during the winter, and we must now grasp the time to further fully implement the production plan in accordance with the national plan and resolutely implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries comprehensively. Some communes and brigades have production plans drawn up by capitalist-roaders in power, who only care about the small collective or individual interests and do not consider the national interests, arranging unreasonable crop and variety layouts. These should be thoroughly revised or adjusted immediately. Now that the revolutionary rebels are in power, we must put the national interests first.

Prepare and replace seeds. The quantity of seeds must match the planned area. Regions planning to expand the sowing of improved varieties should start seed selection early. Some communes and brigades have capitalist-roaders in power who play economic tricks, arbitrarily distributing production funds, public accumulations, and seeds to commune members, attempting to implement the "three no's" policy of eating up, using up, and distributing up, disrupting production, and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary rebels and poor and lower-middle peasants must thoroughly expose their tricks, educate the deceived masses, and never be fooled. Return the seeds and funds to ensure the production of 1967.

Accumulate and produce fertilizer. Production develops year by year, and the area of high-yielding and high-fertilizer-tolerant varieties planted in various places is also increasing. To fully exploit the yield-increasing potential of high-yielding and improved varieties, we must have sufficient fertilizer. The warm spring season is an excellent time for accumulating and producing fertilizer. In addition to managing green manure and duckweed well, we must vigorously promote the collection of silt, opening of grass ponds, and cutting of green grass to accumulate and produce heap fertilizer and compost. Before spring farming, we must prepare sufficient high-quality fertilizer. The ash from rice seedling cultivation must also be collected and managed in time to prevent loss.

Repair agricultural water conservancy. In hilly areas and the new rice-growing areas in Huaibei, some places have incomplete water conservancy projects and are prone to drought. Now the ponds and reservoirs have insufficient water storage, posing a great threat to production. We must organize labor to carry out necessary repairs, prepare for water diversion channels, and make preparations for water diversion and storage. We must expand ponds and reservoirs, build new reservoirs, and increase water storage. During rain and snow, we must divert as much rainwater as possible into ponds and reservoirs to prevent loss and ensure water for spring sowing and the entire year's production. The Liuxi River area must change the habit of serial irrigation and flooding, separate irrigation and drainage channels, and ensure both irrigation and drainage. The ridge-building of paddy fields in Huaibei new rice-growing areas and the land-leveling work underway in various places must be combined with agricultural water conservancy for reasonable arrangements to facilitate irrigation, drainage, and mechanized farming.

Other preparations for spring farming, such as raising draft animals and repairing agricultural machinery, must also be implemented one by one and done well.

To achieve a bumper harvest in 1967, we must do a lot of work, and the most important thing is the ideological transformation of the people. Comrades, revolutionary rebels, and poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, grasp revolution, promote production, and raise the level of agricultural production in 1967 to a new height.

    擂起革命战鼓，立即掀起春耕生产高潮
    全国农业劳动模范、江苏省红色造反总司令部科学院江苏分院红色造反联合总部　陈永康
    江苏省农村无产阶级文化大革命正在轰轰烈烈地展开，革命造反派冲破层层阻力“杀”出来了，形势好得很！我们农业战线上的革命同志，一定要认识到，农业是国民经济的基础，农业收成的好坏，直接影响着国计民生，也直接影响我国的无产阶级文化大革命运动。因此，我们革命造反派、贫下中农和革命干部，要坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把在无产阶级文化大革命中所激发起来的冲天革命干劲，用到生产中去；在当前，必须迅速擂起春耕生产的战鼓，掀起春耕生产新高潮。
    农村各级革命的领导干部，要挺身而出，“杀”上春耕生产的第一线去。我们贫下中农革命造反派，要牢记毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们要严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的地、富、反、坏、右分子，他们兴风作浪，打击革命干部、破坏集体生产、破坏文化大革命。他们还在作物布局、品种安排和夏熟作物田间管理上，以及劳力安排、工分报酬上耍阴谋，搞破坏。我们贫下中农革命造反派就是要随时揭破这一小撮坏家伙的种种阴谋，给以有力的反击，和真正的革命干部结合起来，团结广大革命群众，组织起浩浩荡荡的生产大军。各公社、生产大队和生产队应当健全领导生产的班子。生产领导班子瘫痪的地方，我们革命造反派应遵照毛主席的教导：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”勇敢地挑起革命、生产的两副担子，同革命的有生产经验的贫下中农一起，组织起抓革命、促生产的班子，领导好春耕生产。
    现在，立春已过，春耕的农忙季节即将到来。机不可失，时不再来。当前最迫切的任务就是加强夏熟作物的田间管理，及早做好春耕各项准备。下面想就这两方面的问题谈一些自己的看法。
    一、加强夏熟作物和绿肥管理。夺取一九六七年农业生产的胜利，首先要打胜夏熟作物丰收这一仗。三分种，七分管。当前正是夏熟作物田间管理的关键时刻，一定要抓紧进行。
    目前，江苏省的三麦、油菜，正在陆续返青，这是夺取三麦穗多穗大、油菜壮苔增枝的关键时期。要抓紧四项工作：第一，狠抓三麦的返青肥，早施重施油菜的春肥。对于底肥和冬前追肥少、苗脚瘦黄的，更要抓得紧，施得多，促进早发。第二，及时清沟理垄，做到沟沟相通，水有出路。第三，中耕、除草、壅根。条播麦田，结合施肥中耕一次；花碱土地区，更要做好中耕，防止返盐。油菜一般要松土二至三次，掌握浅、深、浅原则，通过中耕，达到灭草、通气、保湿、壮根的目的。第四，做好防病治虫的药械准备。今年的绿肥，要特别加强田间管理，千方百计提高鲜草量。现在立春已过，天气逐渐转暖，越冬绿萍要抓紧管理，促进繁殖。
    二、做好春耕春种的各项准备工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗，每战都应力求有准备”。搞农业生产就是和天地打仗。要夺取一九六七年秋熟丰收，现在就要着手进行各项准备。
    安排好农作物的生产布局，这是一项关系到全年生产的大事。它不仅影响到一个社队的生产，而且影响到整个国民经济计划。许多社队，在去年冬天对今年生产已作了初步安排，当前还应抓紧时间，根据国家计划，坚决贯彻以粮为纲，农林牧副渔全面发展的方针，进一步全面落实生产计划。有些社队，原有的生产计划是由走资本主义道路当权派订出来的，他们只顾小集体或个人，不顾国家利益，安排了不合理的作物、品种布局，应该立即进行彻底修订或调整。现在革命造反派掌权了，一定要把国家利益放在第一位。
    备足、换好种子。种子的数量一定要和计划面积对口。准备扩种良种的地区，要及早进行调种。有些社队走资本主义道路当权派，玩弄经济主义鬼把戏，把生产资金、公共积累、种子等随意分给社员，妄想实行吃光、用光、分光的“三光”政策，破坏生产，破坏文化大革命。革命造反派和贫下中农，一定要彻底揭露他们的阴谋，教育受蒙蔽的群众，千万不能上当，退回种子和资金，保证一九六七年的生产。
    积肥造肥。生产年年发展，各地种植的耐肥高产品种的面积也越来越大。要充分发挥高产良种的增产潜力，必须有充足的肥料。春暖季节正是积肥造肥的良好时机，除管好绿肥绿萍以外，要狠抓罱泥渣、开草塘、割青草，积造堆肥、沤肥，在春耕前准备好足够的高质量的肥料。水稻育秧的草木灰，也要随时收集管理起来，避免散失。
    整修农田水利。丘陵地区和淮北新稻区，有的地方水利工程还不健全，容易受旱，现在塘坝蓄水又不足，对生产有很大的威胁。要组织劳力进行必要的整修，为整修引水渠道，做好引水蓄水准备，扩大塘坝，修筑新水库，增加蓄水量等。下雨落雪时，要尽可能把雨水引进塘坝，不使流失，保证春播和全年的生产用水。里下河地区要改变串灌、漫灌的习惯，灌排渠道要分开，做到能灌能排。淮北新稻区的?田打埂和各地正在进行的平整土地工作，都要结合农田水利合理安排，便于灌溉排水和机械耕作。
    其他还有养好耕畜、添修农机具等各项备耕工作，都要一项一项落实，抓紧抓好。
    要夺一九六七年的丰收，还要做很多工作，尤其重要的是人的思想革命化。农村革命造反派和贫下中农同志们，我们一定要听毛主席的话，抓革命，促生产，把一九六七年的农业生产提高到一个新的水平。
