The Albanian "People's Voice" has hailed China's Cultural Revolution entering a decisive stage. The revolutionary rebels' struggle for power is unstoppable.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on February 2nd, the Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on February 1st titled "The Cultural Revolution ignited by Chairman Mao is burning away all the garbage of revisionism and capitalism in China." The editorial warmly hails the excellent situation of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution. The article states that the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution is proceeding victoriously. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary workers and peasants in cities and countryside, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a comprehensive attack on a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the support of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, they are seizing power one by one from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road.

The article states that another great victory of the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is that the revolutionary masses in cities and countryside have given a severe blow to the bourgeois rightists and revisionists who attempt to sabotage the socialist economy and the alliance between workers and peasants. Workers, peasants, students, and revolutionary cadres, in their just struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, have received strong and comprehensive support from the pillar of proletarian dictatorship—the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The article points out that the struggle between the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the bourgeois reactionary line, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and the struggle for the complete victory of the proletarian Cultural Revolution are entering a decisive stage.

The article points out that revolution is not about inviting people to dine. Revolution is a violent action of one class overthrowing another. Once the proletarian revolution begins, it will never stop halfway, never retreat in the face of the enemy. The threats and intimidations of the enemy will not frighten the revolutionaries. Opportunists will never understand the strength and creative spirit of the revolutionary masses. They will also never understand that once great ideas are grasped by the masses, they will become an invincible material force.

The article warmly praises the Chinese hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, fully exercising socialist democracy under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

The article states that the current struggle in China between the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the bourgeois reactionary line clearly shows us that there is an irreconcilable antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. It is either the proletariat in power or the bourgeoisie in power. Therefore, it is completely correct for China's workers, peasants, students, and revolutionary cadres to seize power from a handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, according to the teachings of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. If revolutionary measures are not taken in time, it means that the country will eventually change color.

The article enthusiastically hails the excellent revolutionary situation in China. A handful of stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line have already been completely isolated and are under constant attack by the revolutionary masses. There is no force that can save them from complete ruin.

The article concludes by saying that no matter how the domestic and foreign enemies struggle, no matter how they slander and defame, no force in the world can stop the proletarian Cultural Revolution from advancing. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the People's Republic of China will become even stronger and will become an indestructible fortress of Marxism-Leninism and socialism forever.

### 阿《人民之声报》欢呼我国文化大革命进入决定性阶段  革命造反派夺权斗争势不可当

    阿《人民之声报》欢呼我国文化大革命进入决定性阶段
    革命造反派夺权斗争势不可当
    据新华社地拉那二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表一篇题为《毛泽东主席点燃的文化大革命火焰正在胜利地烧掉修正主义、资本主义在中国的一切垃圾》的编辑部文章，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很。文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利进行。亿万城乡革命劳动人民在毛泽东思想的指导下，向一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线发起了全面的进攻。他们在毛泽东主席的领导下，在中共中央的支持下，正在从一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中一个一个地夺权。
    文章说，以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线的另一伟大胜利是，城乡革命群众给企图破坏社会主义经济、破坏工农联盟的资产阶级右派分子和修正主义者的反革命经济主义以严厉打击。工人、农民、学生和革命干部在反对资产阶级反动路线的正义斗争中，得到无产阶级专政的支柱——中国人民解放军的大力和全面的支持。
    文章指出，以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线同资产阶级反动路线之间的斗争，社会主义道路同资本主义道路之间的斗争，争取无产阶级文化大革命完全胜利的斗争，正在进入一个决定性的阶段。
    文章指出，革命不是请客吃饭。革命是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的暴烈行动。无产阶级革命一旦开始，就绝不会中途停止，绝不会在敌人面前退却，敌人的恐吓、威胁吓不倒革命者。机会主义者永远也不会理解革命群众的力量和创造精神。他们也不可能懂得，伟大的思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变为不可战胜的物质力量。
    文章热烈赞扬中国亿万革命群众在毛泽东思想指导下，充分发扬无产阶级专政条件下的社会主义大民主。
    文章说，目前正在中国进行的以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线同资产阶级反动路线之间的斗争清楚地向我们指出，在无产阶级和资产阶级之间存在着不可调和的对抗性矛盾，不是无产阶级当权，就是资产阶级当权。因此，中国的工人、农民、学生和革命干部按照伟大领袖毛泽东同志的教导，从一小撮混进党内的资产阶级代表人物手中夺权是完全正确的。如果不及时采取革命措施，就意味着国家迟早要改变颜色。
    文章热情欢呼中国目前的革命形势好得很。一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，已经处于完全孤立的地位，处于革命群众的不断打击之下，没有任何力量能够挽救他们彻底完蛋的命运。
    文章最后说，不管国内外敌人如何挣扎，不管他们怎样进行诬蔑和诽谤，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡无产阶级文化大革命向前发展。在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下，中华人民共和国将变得更加强大，将成为马克思列宁主义和社会主义的永远不可摧毁的堡垒。
