Over the past few days, personnel from our overseas institutions and students studying abroad have continued to hold meetings, send telegrams, and write letters to strongly protest the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's bloody suppression of our students in Europe. They have expressed fervent support for the revolutionary actions of our students studying abroad.

Their days are numbered." Chinese economic and technical experts held a meeting to denounce the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in a certain place in Korea on January 29. The attendees unanimously raised their fists and shouted, "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!" After the meeting, they wrote more than thirty letters of denunciation and protest.
