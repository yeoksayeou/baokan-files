The Central Committee's letter has greatly inspired the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xigou Brigade in Pingxian County, Shanxi Province. They held a mobilization meeting and resolved to print the Central Committee's call in their minds and implement it in action.

New China News Agency, Taiyuan, February 27th: The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to all poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country is like a spring thunder, reaching Xigou Brigade in Pingxian County, Shanxi Province. The entire brigade of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres said with great enthusiasm: This letter is the mobilization order issued by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee to us. We firmly respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, grasp the revolution, and promote production, and give an excellent answer to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's concern for us.

On February 25th, all the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xigou Brigade held a "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production, and Fire the First Shot of Spring Ploughing" mobilization meeting. National famous agricultural labor model Li Shunda said with great excitement at the meeting: The letter issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is the warm care and great encouragement of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee to us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. Chairman Mao cares about us poor and lower-middle peasants the most, believes in us the most, supports us the most, and understands us the most. Chairman Mao has given us such great trust, and we must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and ensure that we fight a beautiful battle in spring ploughing production.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xigou Brigade can say and do. Since the rural Cultural Revolution began last winter, they have always remembered Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," always keeping this great call in mind and implementing it in action. They work on the movement at night and on production during the day, and have not stopped production for a single day in the past few months. The Cultural Revolution here is booming, and production is also solid. Since last winter, Xigou Brigade has launched a massive agricultural land construction. All 450-plus male and female laborers in the brigade braved the wind and snow to complete the winter and spring agricultural land construction tasks excellently.

To fire the first shot of spring ploughing production, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xigou Brigade have firmly grasped the active study and application of the "Three Articles." Everyone not only regards themselves as a force of the revolution but also regards themselves as an object of the revolution, carrying out a thorough revolution in their souls, sweeping away the "self" and establishing the "public." After studying Chairman Mao's works, they carried out the revolution more vigorously and grasped production more tightly. They said: "We must be both pioneers of the Cultural Revolution and vanguards of production."

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xigou Brigade are always vigilant against the sabotage activities of class enemies. Recently, some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in Xigou Brigade who insist on their reactionary stance have taken the opportunity of the Cultural Revolution to viciously attack the good cadres of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Li Shunda. The poor and lower-middle peasants and Red Guards of Xigou Brigade have exposed these bad elements and suppressed their reactionary momentum.

Currently, the spring ploughing production of Xigou Brigade is booming, and the fields are full of a thriving and prosperous scene: The community members fight from dawn to dusk every day on the mountains and in the valleys. More than 1,500 mu of hillside fields have been plowed flat and smooth. Various spring sowing tools have been repaired and renewed. Fertilizer is also better prepared than last year, and so far, 80% of the fertilizer has been delivered to the fields. Seeds have begun germination tests. All the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xigou Brigade are turning Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production" into actual actions and are striving for dual victories in revolution and production.

    向毛主席保证：一定在春耕生产中打个漂亮仗
    党中央的信极大地鼓舞了山西平顺县西沟大队的贫下中农和革命干部，他们举行誓师大会，决心把党中央的号召印在脑子里，落实在行动上
    新华社太原二十七日电　《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》象一声春雷，传到了山西省平顺县西沟大队。西沟大队全体贫下中农和革命干部满怀激情地说：这封信是毛主席、党中央向我们发出的动员令，我们坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以出色的成绩回答毛主席和党中央对我们的关怀。
    二月二十五日，西沟大队全体贫下中农和革命干部，举行了“抓革命，促生产，打响春耕第一炮誓师大会”。全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达以万分激动的心情在大会上说：中共中央发出的这封信，是毛主席和党中央对我们贫下中农和革命干部的亲切关怀和巨大鼓舞。毛主席他老人家最关心咱们贫下中农，最相信咱们贫下中农，最支持咱们贫下中农，最了解咱们贫下中农。毛主席给了咱们这样大的信任，我们一定不辜负毛主席的期望，保证在春耕生产中打一个漂亮仗。
    西沟大队的贫下中农和革命干部，说得出，做得到。从去年冬天农村文化大革命开展以来，他们就牢牢记住毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，时时刻刻把这个伟大号召记在脑子里，落实在行动上。他们晚上搞运动，白天搞生产，几个月来没有停顿过一天生产。这里的文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产也搞得扎扎实实。从去年初冬，西沟大队就展开了巨大的农田基本建设。全大队四百五十多名男女劳力，顶风冒雪进行战斗，出色地完成了去冬今春农田基本建设的任务。
    为了打响春耕生产第一炮，西沟大队贫下中农和革命干部狠狠地抓住活学活用“老三篇”，人人既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又把自己当作革命的对象，在灵魂深处大闹革命，横扫“私”字，大立“公”字。学了毛主席著作，他们革命搞得更起劲，生产也抓得更紧了。他们说：“我们既要做文化大革命的闯将，也要做生产的先锋。”
    西沟大队的贫下中农和革命干部时刻警惕着阶级敌人的破坏活动。最近西沟大队的一些坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏分子，竟利用文化大革命的机会，恶毒攻击贫下中农的好干部李顺达。西沟大队的贫下中农和红卫兵小将们揪出了这些坏家伙，把他们的反动气焰打了下去。
    目前，西沟大队的春耕生产正搞得热气腾腾，田野上到处呈现一片欣欣向荣的动人景象：社员们从清晨到黄昏，天天奋战在山上山下，一千五百多亩山坡地已经耙得平平整整。各种春播用具都已修整一新。肥料也比去年准备得又多又好，到目前为止，已经有百分之八十的肥料送到了田间。种籽已经开始作发芽试验。西沟大队全体贫下中农和革命干部，正在把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，变成实际行动，为夺取革命和生产双胜利而奋斗。
