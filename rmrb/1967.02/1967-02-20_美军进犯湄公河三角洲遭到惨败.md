    U.S. troops invading the Mekong Delta to carry out their "pacification" scheme have suffered heavy defeats. According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in the central southern region of South Vietnam have dealt heavy blows to the U.S. aggressors since the beginning of this year, foiling the enemy's numerous "sweeping" operations and achieving brilliant victories.

    Statistics show that in January alone, the liberation armed forces in the central southern region conducted 113 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 2,762 enemy personnel, including 653 U.S. aggressors and over 100 mercenaries. They annihilated two enemy battalions, eight companies, and ten platoons. The number of U.S. troops eliminated is almost equal to the total number of U.S. troops eliminated in the central southern region in the fourth quarter of last year.

    The liberation armed forces also shot down eight enemy planes, destroyed or damaged 13 military vehicles, sank one large dredging ship, and sank or damaged 11 other vessels.

    美军进犯湄公河三角洲遭到惨败
    据新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方南部中区解放武装力量从今年年初以来，给予进犯湄公河三角洲推行“绥靖”阴谋的美国侵略军以沉重打击，挫败了敌人的多次“扫荡”，取得了辉煌的战果。
    据统计，在今年一月份，南部中区解放武装力量共进行了一百一十三次战斗，打死打伤和俘虏敌人二千七百六十二名，其中包括美国侵略军六百五十三名和帮凶军一百多名，全歼伪军两个营、八个连和十个排。被消灭的美军几乎等于去年第四季度在南部中区被消灭的美军的总数。
    解放武装力量还打落敌机八架，击毁击伤军车十三辆，炸沉巨型挖泥船一艘，炸沉炸伤其他船只十一艘。
