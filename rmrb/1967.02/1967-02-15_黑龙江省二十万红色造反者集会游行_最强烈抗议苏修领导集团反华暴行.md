		200,000 Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Hold Rally and March to Strongly Protest Soviet Revisionist Leadership's Anti-China Atrocities

		Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 14 — Today, 200,000 Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province held a rally in Harbin City to express their firm support for the statement issued by our government and to strongly protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

		Members of the Heilongjiang Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee, including Pan Fusheng, Wang Jiadao, Shang Zhengmei, You Xingmao, and Liu Xuefeng, attended the rally. Representatives from the Harbin City Workers' Red Rebel Headquarters, the Harbin City Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Red Rebel Corps, the Harbin City Red Guards Headquarters for the Thought of Mao Zedong, the Harbin City Financial and Commercial System Red Rebel Corps, the Liaoning Province Red Guards Headquarters Liaison Station in Harbin, and the Heilongjiang Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee spoke at the rally. They pointed out that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has done countless evil deeds and will not escape historical punishment. The demands put forward by our government's statement must be met by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. They also expressed their determination to boost morale, strengthen their work, and fight bravely to consolidate the red new power in Heilongjiang, build Heilongjiang Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and build it into a strong fortress against imperialism and revisionism, making the American and Soviet imperialists tremble before us!

		The rally, amidst thunderous applause, passed a telegram denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The telegram sternly warned the Soviet government: If you continue down the path of anti-China, you will not have a good end. The telegram stated that the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable by any force. The actions of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique are contrary to the interests of the Soviet people, and their reckless behavior is merely a final struggle. The Red Rebels of Heilongjiang Province will definitely hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unite with the people of the entire province, the entire country, the Soviet people, and the people of the world, and carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership clique to the end.

		The rally concluded with a massive demonstration march.

    黑龙江省二十万红色造反者集会游行
    最强烈抗议苏修领导集团反华暴行
    新华社哈尔滨十四日电　黑龙江省二十万红色造反者今天在哈尔滨市举行大会，表示坚决拥护我国政府声明，最最强烈地抗议苏修统治集团制造的反华法西斯暴行。
    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会成员潘复生、汪家道、尚政美、游兴懋、刘雪峰等出席了大会。哈尔滨市工人红色造反者总司令部、哈尔滨市贫下中农红色造反团、哈尔滨市毛泽东思想红卫兵总部、哈尔滨市财贸系统红色造反团、毛泽东思想红卫兵沈阳总部驻哈联络站和黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会的代表，先后在大会上讲话。他们指出，苏修统治集团做尽了坏事，他们决不会逃脱历史的惩罚。我国政府声明提出的严正要求，苏修统治集团必须照办。他们还表示要激励斗志，加强工作，英勇战斗，巩固黑龙江的红色新政权，把黑龙江省建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，建设成反帝反修的坚强堡垒，让美帝苏修在我们的面前发抖！
    大会在全场热烈的掌声中，通过了声讨苏修统治集团法西斯暴行的通电。通电严厉警告苏联政府：如果你们沿着反华的道路走下去，是绝对不会有好下场的。通电说，中苏两国人民的伟大友谊是任何力量都破坏不了的。苏修统治集团的所作所为，与苏联人民的利益背道而驰，他们的倒行逆施，只是一种最后挣扎。黑龙江省红色造反者一定要高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同全省全国人民，以及苏联人民和世界人民团结起来，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    大会最后举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
