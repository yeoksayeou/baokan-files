Minister Bilani of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Planning of Mauritania praised Chairman Mao at a farewell banquet, saying that Chairman Mao is a leader respected by the people, not only of China but of the world's revolutionaries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever be a reliable friend of the Mauritanian people.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, Mauritania's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Planning, Bilani Mamadou Wane, said at a farewell banquet he hosted today that Chairman Mao Zedong is not only a leader respected by the Chinese people but also a leader respected by revolutionaries worldwide. He said that the glorious victories achieved by China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in other areas of construction have irrefutably proven that human courage and willpower are invincible. Here, we have gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings.

Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi was invited to attend the banquet and delivered a speech.

Relevant officials from China and ambassadors from Asian and African countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

Minister Bilani spoke first at the banquet. He said, "It is an honor and a great pleasure to be able to gather with you once again in this capital of revolution and progress."

Minister Bilani pointed out that Africans should be vigilant against imperialism and its lackeys in Africa. He said that on this issue, Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings are very beneficial. We should learn from the brave Chinese people's spirit of "daring to struggle, daring to win." As long as there is still one African or Asian country under foreign rule, we should not relax our efforts.

He said, "We must wage an uncompromising struggle against imperialism and its lackeys in Africa, a struggle to the death. This struggle is difficult, but its outcome is certain. Chairman Mao is right: 'The reactionaries are in front of us, and we are in front of them. The reactionaries have difficulties that are insurmountable because they are forces approaching death with no future. Our difficulties are surmountable because we are new and have a bright future.'"

Minister Bilani said, "We are sure to achieve final victory. We must resolutely struggle against imperialism, restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and allow them to return to their occupied homeland. We must provide necessary support to the brave Vietnamese people in their struggle against foreign aggression."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, thanked Minister Bilani for his friendly remarks. He said, "You have given a positive evaluation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. You have praised Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. You stand on the side of justice, not sacrificing principles to appease imperialism and old and new colonialism."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "In your struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, you will surely receive the support of the African people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever be a reliable friend of the Mauritanian people."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Currently, imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are causing trouble in Asia, in Africa, and around the world. But their troublemaking is merely the last struggle before their doom. They do nothing but evil, and their days are numbered. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' As long as the Asian and African peoples strengthen their unity, and the people of the world strengthen their unity, dare to struggle, and are good at struggling, we will surely defeat imperialism and all reactionaries!"

Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterated the basic principles for handling relations with African countries proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1963.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "These are our unwavering positions."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "We highly value your policy of self-reliance in developing a national independent economy. This is completely correct and fully in line with the interests of the Mauritanian people."

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the Mauritanian government delegation's visit to China, saying it has strengthened the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania, developed friendly cooperation between the two countries, and contributed to the cause of Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism. Vice Premier Chen Yi asked the Mauritanian friends to convey the deep affection of the Chinese people to the Mauritanian people and to tell the Mauritanian people about the spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, where the Chinese people are full of vigor and march forward courageously.

    比拉尼部长在告别招待会上赞颂说
    毛主席是全世界革命者深孚众望的领袖
    陈毅副总理说用毛泽东思想武装的中国人民永远是毛里塔尼亚人民完全可以信赖的朋友
    据新华社十五日讯　毛里塔尼亚外交、计划部长比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼今天在他举行的告别招待会上赞颂说，毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民深孚众望的领袖，也是全世界革命者的深孚众望的领袖。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命和其他建设方面所取得的辉煌胜利，无可辩驳地证明了，人的勇气和意志是抗拒不了的。在这里，我们对毛泽东主席的教导又有了体会。
    国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅应邀出席招待会，并在招待会上讲了话。
    我国各有关方面的负责人，和亚非国家驻中国的使节，也应邀出席了招待会。
    比拉尼部长在招待会上首先讲话。他说，今晚能在这个革命和进步的首都，同你们再次聚会在一起，感到荣幸和非常愉快。
    比拉尼部长指出，非洲人应该警惕帝国主义和它在非洲的走狗。他说，在这个问题上，毛泽东主席的教导是很有益的。我们应该学习英勇的中国人民“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”的精神。只要还有一个非洲国家或亚洲国家处在外国统治之下，我们就不应该松懈我们的努力。
    他说，我们应当同帝国主义及其在非洲的走狗进行一场无情的斗争，进行一场你死我活的斗争。这场斗争是困难的，但其结局却是肯定无疑的。毛泽东主席说得对：“反动势力面前和我们面前都有困难。但是反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”
    比拉尼部长说，我们肯定能取得最后胜利，我们必须同帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，恢复巴勒斯坦人民的合法权利，使他们重返被侵占的祖国，给勇敢的越南人民反抗外国侵略的英勇斗争以必要的支持。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中感谢比拉尼部长刚才友好的讲话。他说，你们对中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动，做出了积极的评价。你们称赞毛泽东主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。你们站在正义的立场，而不是牺牲原则来迎合帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    陈毅副总理说，在你们坚持反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中，你们一定会得到非洲人民、中国人民、全世界人民的支持。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，永远是毛里塔尼亚人民完全可以信赖的朋友。
    陈毅副总理说，目前，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派正在亚洲捣乱，在非洲捣乱，在全世界各地捣乱。但是，他们的捣乱，只不过是灭亡之前的最后挣扎。他们尽做坏事，他们的日子长不了。毛主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”只要亚非人民加强团结，全世界人民加强团结，敢于斗争，善于斗争，我们就一定能够把帝国主义和一切反动派统统打倒！
    陈毅副总理重申一九六三年周恩来总理提出的中国处理同非洲国家相互关系的一些基本原则。
    陈毅副总理说，这些就是我们坚持不渝的立场。
    陈毅副总理说，我们很重视你们提出的自力更生发展民族独立经济的方针。这是完全正确的，完全符合毛里塔尼亚人民的利益。
    陈毅副总理称赞毛里塔尼亚政府代表团这次访问中国，增强了中毛两国人民的友谊，发展了两国友好合作关系，并且为亚非人民团结反帝事业作出了贡献。陈毅副总理请毛里塔尼亚朋友们把中国人民的深情厚谊带给毛里塔尼亚人民，把中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东主席领导下，意气风发、勇往直前的无产阶级文化大革命的精神，告诉毛里塔尼亚人民。
