Some revolutionary masses and fighters of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai have recently reviewed the struggle to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have studied Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues and deeply felt the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They said that only by implementing the "three-in-one combination" can we achieve a thorough victory in the struggle to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proceeds along the track of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's cadre policy in the future, further implement the "three-in-one combination," unite all the broad masses and revolutionary cadres who can be united, form a mighty revolutionary army, and carry the struggle to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to the end, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

"Overthrowing everyone" is wrong

Two revolutionary rebels from the Shanghai Ink Factory said that in the previous stage, some comrades in our factory had the idea that all those in power should be overthrown and all cadres should be pulled out. Some cadres, although they had only made general mistakes, were also proposed to be "dismissed." Some comrades even dared not talk to cadres, fearing they would be accused of having unstable positions. We have come to realize through actual struggle that this idea of indiscriminately thinking that all those in power should be overthrown and all cadres should be pulled out is wrong and does not conform to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Chairman Mao teaches us, "We must be good at identifying cadres," "We must be good at using cadres," "We must be good at protecting cadres." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have analyzed the situation of all cadres in the factory to distinguish between different situations and deal with them differently.

They said that from the situation of our factory's cadres, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are only a small number. The vast majority of cadres are good, listen to Chairman Mao, and are revolutionary. We should unite with them and fight together. For cadres who have made general mistakes, we should adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," allowing them to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For these cadres, we absolutely cannot "overthrow them all"!

They said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." When seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction and implement the "three-in-one combination"; when in power, we must also implement the "three-in-one combination" and unite and give play to the role of cadres. The key to mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres lies, on the one hand, in the cadres themselves standing up to rebel, and on the other hand, in our revolutionary faction organizations correctly carrying out Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

Because our factory's revolutionary faction organizations act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, distinguish between different situations, and deal with cadres differently, we have united the majority and mobilized their revolutionary enthusiasm. Two factory-level cadres, both of whom are old workers, have long been suppressed and isolated in the Party branch committee. This time, they stood up, examined their own mistakes, exposed the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We helped them further raise their awareness and united with them to fight together. Because we firmly carry out Chairman Mao's cadre policy, many cadres have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," actively take responsibility, and do their work well. Some have even proposed to join the revolutionary rebel corps. We deeply feel that only in this way can we unite the majority of cadres, isolate and strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and it is beneficial to grasp revolution and promote production.

We must be good at using class analysis to identify cadres

Three revolutionary fighters from the People's Machinery Factory said that in class society, there is no abstract, classless power-holder. Either it is a power-holder of the proletariat, or it is a power-holder of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, whether a leading cadre is revolutionary or not cannot be measured by his position (such as secretary, factory director, etc.) or rank, but should be measured by class analysis and political standards.

They said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not forget to draw these two distinctions when looking at problems: the distinction between revolution and counter-revolution, and the distinction between achievements and shortcomings." Therefore, to determine whether a leading cadre is a power-holder of the proletariat or a power-holder of the bourgeoisie, we must see which class position he stands on: whether he stands on the side of the revolutionary people or on the side of the counter-revolutionaries. In dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, we must look at whether their achievements are the main part or their mistakes are the main part in their entire work. If we do not draw these two distinctions, we will confuse the nature of the problem. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and adopt concrete analysis for every person and every matter. For leading cadres who have made mistakes in their lines, we must also distinguish whether they have consciously or unconsciously executed them, the degree of executing the wrong line, and their attitude towards their own mistakes.

They said, our factory's revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses have handled the problem of factory-level leading cadres according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They are not pulling out one by one according to their problems, but are handling them differently according to the nature and severity of their problems. For those whose mistakes are serious and who stubbornly resist, we must firmly fight them. For those who are willing to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they are now continuing to take up leadership work. We revolutionary rebels have the responsibility to unite revolutionary cadres, help and encourage them to stand up and rebel. Unite all revolutionary cadres who can be united, which is beneficial to strengthen the revolutionary faction's forces, concentrate forces to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and is beneficial to grasp revolution, promote production, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is beneficial to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Using the position or rank of leading cadres to distinguish whether they are power-holders of the proletariat or power-holders of the bourgeoisie is metaphysical and wrong. We must use class analysis and political standards to examine leading cadres, unite all cadres who are willing to rebel together to make revolution; at the same time, we also hope and welcome revolutionary cadres to stand up and rebel themselves.

Look at cadres' overall performance

A fighter from the People's Candy Factory Revolutionary Rebel Corps said that in our factory, a leading cadre organized part of the masses to post big-character posters against another part of the masses during the movement, suppressing the masses from rebelling and shifting the direction of the struggle. How should we view this cadre? The committee had a debate. Some committee members thought that this cadre's mistakes were serious and should be overthrown, while others did not agree with this view. Since we could not reach a consensus, we turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should we look at a cadre's one-time one-event, but we should also look at a cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we conducted a concrete analysis of this cadre. He executed the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressed the masses, which is a fact. However, this cadre begged for food in the old society, joined the army at the age of sixteen, and soon joined the Party. After receiving more than ten years of Party education in the army, he came to the factory and worked diligently. He has deep feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. In this movement, he was deceived and, starting from the wrong "organizational concept," executed the wrong line and took the wrong path.

For such cadres, we cannot simply overthrow them. As long as they do not persist in their mistakes, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and follow the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to help them correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We have achieved good results by doing this. After several rounds of education and help, this cadre made a deep self-examination to the masses and was able to work seriously, and also exposed many problems.

We must welcome cadres to rebel

A revolutionary fighter from the 3516 Factory said, if a revolutionary faction organization absorbs some leading cadres, will this organization become a "protective" organization? We had a debate on this issue. In the early stage of the movement, a combat team in our factory was preparing to absorb a deputy workshop director to join, and some comrades disagreed, saying that the deputy workshop director is the power-holder of the workshop. In the early stage of the movement, he also made mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. If such a person is allowed to join, will the revolutionary faction organization not become a "protective" organization, becoming a "shelter" for cadres?

We seriously studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and conducted another comprehensive analysis of this deputy workshop director. This worker-born deputy workshop director has worked relatively seriously in the past and has deep feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. Although he also executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stage of the movement, this was because he was deceived. Now he is willing to correct his mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and has stood up to rebel. Although the stubborn power-holders of the bourgeois reactionary line have repeatedly threatened him, he still firmly stands on the side of the revolutionary faction. After such an analysis, everyone felt that for revolutionary cadres who are willing to correct their mistakes and stand up to rebel, we cannot exclude them from the revolutionary faction.

They said, our attitude is that absorbing these cadres to join is not to "protect" them, and their mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line are not "covered up." We absorb truly revolutionary leading cadres into the revolutionary faction organization, which is completely in line with Chairman Mao's strategic policy of uniting more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres. Absorbing truly revolutionary leading cadres to join the revolutionary faction organization can enhance the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary faction organization, which is beneficial to thoroughly expose and criticize a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The standard for judging whether an organization is a genuine revolutionary faction or not is not whether it has absorbed cadres to join, but what kind of cadres it has absorbed. If fake revolutionary cadres are absorbed and become their "shelter," this will become a "protective" organization. On the contrary, absorbing revolutionary cadres who want to rebel into the organization will only enhance the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary faction organization, which is very beneficial for seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and holding power well. Doing this can also further educate and encourage the broad revolutionary cadres to actively stand up to rebel, together with the revolutionary faction, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    上海一些无产阶级革命派战士畅谈夺权斗争体会
    毛主席的干部政策正确无比威力无比
    调动干部革命积极性的关键：一方面在干部自己站起来造反；另一方面在革命派组织正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策
    据新华社上海二十四日电　上海一些无产阶级革命派组织和战士，最近回顾前一阶段向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，认真地学习了我们伟大领袖毛主席有关干部问题的指示，更加深刻地体会到毛主席的干部政策的无比威力。他们说，只有实行“三结合”，才能获得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的彻底胜利，保证文化大革命沿着毛泽东思想的轨道前进。他们表示，今后一定要更加坚决地执行毛主席的干部政策，进一步实行“三结合”，团结一切可以团结的广大群众和革命干部，组成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争进行到底，把文化大革命进行到底！
    “打倒一切”是错误的
    上海油墨厂两个革命造反队员说，前一阶段，我们厂里有些同志曾经产生一种凡是当权派都要打、凡是干部都要揪的情绪。有的干部虽然只犯了一般的错误，也有人提出要“罢官”。有的同志甚至不敢和干部谈话，怕被人说成“立场不稳”。我们从实际斗争中体会到，这种笼笼统统地认为凡是当权派都要打，凡是干部都要揪的情绪是错误的，是不符合毛主席制定的干部政策的。毛主席教导我们，“必须善于识别干部”，“必须善于使用干部”，“必须善于爱护干部”。我们遵照毛主席的教导，对全厂干部状况进行了分析，以便区别情况，分别对待。
    他们说，从我们厂里的干部状况来看，党内走资本主义道路的当权派只是一小撮。绝大多数的干部是好的，是听毛主席话的，是要革命的，我们要同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起。对犯有一般错误的干部，我们要采用“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，允许他们改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。对于这些干部，绝不能“统统打倒”！
    他们说，毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，我们要实行无产阶级革命派大联合，要实行“三结合”；在掌权的时候，同样要实行“三结合”，团结和发挥干部的作用。调动干部的革命积极性，其关键，一方面在干部自己站起来造反，另一方面就在我们革命派组织正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。
    由于我们厂里的革命派组织按照毛主席的教导办事，对干部区别情况，分别对待，就团结了大多数，调动了他们的革命积极性。有两个厂级干部，他们都是老工人出身，过去长期在党总支委员会中受到压抑，处于孤立，这次站起来检查了自己的错误，也揭发了资产阶级反动路线的罪行，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，我们就帮助他们进一步提高认识，团结他们一起战斗。由于我们坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，许多干部响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，积极负起责任，做好工作。有的还提出了加入革命造反队的要求。我们深深地体会到，只有这样，才有利于团结大多数的干部，孤立和打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才有利于抓革命，促生产。
    要善于用阶级观点识别干部
    人民机器厂三个革命派战士说，在阶级社会里，抽象的超阶级的当权派是没有的。不是无产阶级的当权派，就是资产阶级的当权派。因此，看一个领导干部是不是革命，不能以他的职务（如书记、厂长等）或级别来衡量，而应该以阶级分析和政治标准来衡量。
    他们说，毛主席教导我们：“我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。”因此，确定一个领导干部是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派，就必须看他站在什么阶级立场上：是站在革命人民方面，还是站在反革命方面。对待犯有错误的干部，我们必须看他的全部工作中成绩是主要的还是错误是主要的。如果不划清这两种界限，就会混淆了问题的性质。我们必须按照毛主席的教导，对于每一个人和每一件事都应该采取具体分析。对犯路线错误的领导干部，也要区分他们是自觉还是不自觉执行的、执行错误路线的轻重程度和对待自己错误的态度。
    他们说，我们厂里革命派和革命群众根据毛主席的干部政策处理了厂级领导干部的问题，对他们不是见一个揪一个，而是根据他们问题的性质和轻重程度，作不同的处理。有的错误严重而又负隅顽抗，要坚决斗争。有的愿意改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线方面来，现在照常担负领导工作。我们革命造反队员有责任去团结革命干部，帮助和鼓励他们起来造反。把一切可以团结的革命干部都团结起来，就有利于壮大革命派的力量，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，有利于抓革命、促生产，有利于革命派掌权和巩固无产阶级专政，有利于无产阶级革命事业。
    用领导干部的职务或级别来区别那是无产阶级当权派，那是资产阶级当权派，这是形而上学的，错误的。我们要用阶级分析、用政治标准来检验领导干部，要团结一切愿意革命的干部一起闹革命；同时，也希望和欢迎革命的干部自己起来造反。
      看干部要看一贯的表现
    爱民糖果厂工人革命造反大队战士说，我们厂里，有一个领导干部，在运动中曾经组织一部分群众贴另一部分群众的大字报，压制群众起来革命，转移了斗争的大方向。怎么看待这个干部呢？队委会上发生了争论。有的队委认为，这个干部错误严重，要把他打倒，也有的队委不同意这个意见。思想统一不了，我们就向毛主席的著作求教。毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”根据毛主席的教导，我们对这个干部进行了具体分析。他执行了资产阶级反动路线，压制了群众，这是事实。但是，这个干部在旧社会讨过饭，十六岁就参军，不久入了党，在部队里受过十几年党的教育，来到工厂以后，工作是勤勤恳恳的，对党和毛主席是有深厚感情的，在这次运动中，他受了蒙蔽，从错误的“组织观念”出发，执行了错误路线，走上了错误的道路。
    对这样的干部，我们不能一概打倒。只要他们不坚持错误，我们就应该按照毛主席的教导，采用“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式，帮助他们改正错误，使他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们这样做，收到了很好的效果。经过几次教育和帮助以后，这个干部向群众作了深刻检查，能够认真地做工作，并且起来揭发了不少问题。
    要欢迎干部起来革命
    三五一六工厂革命派战士说，革命派组织里吸收了一些领导干部参加，这个组织会不会变成“保字号”呢？对这个问题，我们是有过争论的。前一时期，我们厂一个战斗队准备吸收一个车间副主任参加，有的同志就不同意，说车间副主任是车间的当权派。在运动初期，他也犯过执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。如果让这样的人参加，革命派组织不是变成“保字号”，变成了干部的“防空洞”了吗！
    我们认真学习了毛主席的有关指示，对这个车间副主任又进行了一次全面的分析。这个工人出身的车间副主任，过去工作比较认真，对党、对毛主席是有深厚的感情的，在运动初期虽然也执行了资产阶级反动路线，但这是受了蒙蔽。现在他愿意改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，并且起来造反了。虽然顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的当权派对他一再威胁，但他仍然坚定地站在革命派一边。这样一分析，大家觉得，对愿意改正错误起来造反的革命干部，我们不能把他们排除在革命派门外。
    他们说，我们的态度是，吸收这些干部参加，不是为了“保”他们，对他们执行资产阶级反动路线的错误不是“包庇”。我们把真正的革命领导干部吸收到革命派组织里来，是完全符合毛主席提出的团结百分之九十五以上的群众和团结百分之九十五以上的干部的战略方针的。吸收真正革命的领导干部参加革命派组织，可以增强革命派组织的战斗力，有利于彻底揭发批判一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。衡量一个组织，是真正的革命派，还是假的，标准不在于是否吸收了干部参加，而是要看吸收什么样的干部参加。如果把假造反的干部吸收进来，而且变成他们的“防空洞”，这才会变成“保字号”。相反，把革命的要造反的干部吸收进来，只会增强革命派组织战斗力，对于夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权和掌好权十分有利。这样做，也可以进一步教育和鼓励广大的革命干部积极起来造反，同革命派一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
