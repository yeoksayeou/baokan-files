Chairman Mao said: "In the face of the enemy's multi-pronged encirclement, the strategy of guerrilla warfare is to break through this encirclement and adopt a counter-encirclement posture."

Colombian guerrillas grow stronger in counter-encirclement

U.S. imperialist puppets deploy thousands of troops in failed "encirclement," three brigade commanders dismissed

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 19th, the Colombian guerrillas have foiled the repeated "encirclement" attempts by the government army, which is armed by U.S. imperialism, and have been consolidated and developed through fierce struggles.

The guerrillas have employed flexible and mobile strategies and tactics to break through the enemy's encirclement, frequently launching surprise attacks, eliminating the enemy's combat forces, and preserving and strengthening their own fighting units. Recently, a combat team of the "Revolutionary Armed Forces" struck a unit of the government army's Sixth Brigade in the Guacamayas region of Caquetá State.

With the support of U.S. imperialism, the Colombian government army has launched repeated "encirclement" operations against the guerrillas over the past year. U.S. imperialism has provided both money and weapons to the Colombian government army and has participated in the formulation of "encirclement" plans. In October last year, the Colombian government deployed 5,000 troops from the Sixth Brigade to "encircle" the guerrillas and soon after sent soldiers from the Eighth Brigade to reinforce them. They used U.S.-made aircraft to indiscriminately bomb guerrilla areas, employing poison gas and incendiary bombs, and brutally implementing a "scorched earth" policy in the guerrilla zones, arbitrarily arresting and killing local farmers. At the same time, they employed tactics such as the so-called "People's Integration Plan" to attempt to deceive and bribe the farmers, severing their ties with the guerrillas. However, both their hard and soft tactics have failed.

Several guerrilla groups in southwestern Colombia united last year under the enemy's fierce attacks to form the Colombian "Revolutionary Armed Forces." They abandoned passive defensive tactics, broke through the encirclement, and launched proactive attacks, actively operating in the regions of Tolima Province, Huila Province, and Caquetá State, continuously striking the enemy forces sent to "encircle" them. Another part of the guerrillas, the "National Liberation Army," also frequently attacked government forces in the northern Santander Province and other regions. Colombian Marxist-Leninists are actively engaging in armed struggle. Currently, the guerrillas can annihilate entire enemy platoons. Due to the failure of suppressing the guerrillas, the brigade commanders of the Fifth Brigade, Second Brigade, and Sixth Brigade, who were sent to the guerrilla areas for "encirclement," have been successively dismissed.

The people's armed forces in Colombia have taken root, developed, and grown in the weakest link of enemy rule—the countryside. Most of their members are farmers, and they have a natural connection with the broad masses, receiving support and assistance from the local farmers and the masses.

According to reports, in recent years, the guerrillas in some regions of Colombia have paid attention to studying Chairman Mao's works. They particularly value Chairman Mao's military works such as "Concentrate Superior Forces to Annihilate the Enemy" and pay attention to and apply Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts of "retreat when the enemy advances, harass when the enemy halts, attack when the enemy is tired, and pursue when the enemy retreats."

The current people's armed forces in Colombia are a "spark" that is bound to spread into a prairie fire. They will inevitably overcome numerous difficulties and march from victory to victory.

### 哥伦比亚游击队在反“围剿”中壮大  美帝走狗出动数千兵力“围剿”失败，三个旅长被撤职

    毛主席说：“在敌人数路围攻的情况之下，游击战争的方针是打破这种围攻，采取反围攻的形态。”
    哥伦比亚游击队在反“围剿”中壮大
    美帝走狗出动数千兵力“围剿”失败，三个旅长被撤职
    据新华社十九日讯  波哥大消息：哥伦比亚游击队挫败了美帝国主义所武装的政府军的反复“围剿”，在激烈的斗争中得到巩固和发展。
    据报道，游击队运用机动灵活的战略战术，突破敌人的包围，不时主动出击，消灭敌人的有生力量，保存和加强了自己的战斗队伍。最近，“革命武装部队”的一个战斗组又在卡克塔州的瓜卡马雅斯地区打击了政府军第六旅的一个分队。
    哥伦比亚政府军在美帝国主义的支持下，在过去一年中不断对游击队发动“围剿”。美帝国主义对哥伦比亚政府军又给钱，又给武器，还参与制定“围剿”计划。哥伦比亚政府在去年十月出动了第六旅五千人的兵力对游击队进行“围剿”，不久又派出第八旅的士兵前往增援。他们用美制飞机滥炸游击地区，使用了毒气弹和烧夷弹，在游击区残暴地推行“三光政策”，乱抓、乱杀游击区的农民。同时，又玩弄所谓“人民一体化计划”等花招，妄图欺骗和收买农民，割断他们同游击队的联系。但是，他们硬、软两手的阴谋都遭到失败。
    哥伦比亚西南地区的几支游击队，在敌人的疯狂进攻中，去年联合起来，成立了哥伦比亚“革命武装部队”。他们改变消极自卫的办法，突破包围、主动出击，活跃在托利马省、乌伊拉省、卡克塔州等地区，不断打击前去“围剿”的敌军。另一部分游击队“民族解放军”也在北部桑坦德省等地区不断袭击政府军。哥伦比亚的马克思列宁主义者正在积极投入武装斗争。现在游击队已能消灭成排的敌人。政府军由于镇压游击队失利，被派到游击区“围剿”的第五旅、第二旅、第六旅的旅长相继被撤职。
    哥伦比亚的人民武装在敌人统治最薄弱的环节——农村中立足、发展、成长，大部分成员是农民，他们同广大群众有天然的联系，得到了广大群众和当地农民的支持和帮助。
    据报道，哥伦比亚一些地区的游击队近年来注意学习毛主席的著作。他们特别重视毛主席的《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》等军事著作，注意和运用毛主席提出的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”等战略战术思想。
    哥伦比亚目前的人民武装力量是势必燎原的“星星之火”，它必将冲破重重困难，从胜利走向胜利。
