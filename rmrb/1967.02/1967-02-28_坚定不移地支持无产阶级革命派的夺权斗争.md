At a critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a new stage, when the proletarian revolutionary factions are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left. All the officers and soldiers of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, enthusiastically, unhesitatingly, and wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionary factions in their struggle to seize power. We have fulfilled our glorious duty, entrusted by the Party and the people, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and have made contributions in the great struggle to seize power.

I

The People's Liberation Army is a proletarian army personally created by Chairman Mao, "an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks," and is a pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. It is the sacred duty of the People's Liberation Army to firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao and to firmly support the proletarian revolutionary factions.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, we have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We have closely followed the development of the class struggle, combined the actual problems of the Cultural Revolution, and studied Chairman Mao's relevant works. With Mao Zedong Thought as our most powerful weapon, we have recognized that a handful of power-holders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, who are taking the capitalist road, have been engaged in capitalist restoration activities for a long time, attempting to turn Shanxi into an independent kingdom of capitalist restoration. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they stubbornly adhered to the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, opposing the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, attempting to suppress the revolutionary mass movement and continue their reactionary rule.

Before the Cultural Revolution, we had long struggled against the handful of power-holders within the Provincial Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have tried several times to win us over, attempting to use the high prestige of the People's Liberation Army to deceive the masses, protect themselves, suppress the revolutionary factions, change the direction of the struggle, and damage the reputation of the army. We saw through their plots and rejected their demands, thereby supporting and protecting the proletarian revolutionary factions.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution developed into a new stage where the proletarian revolutionary factions unite to seize power, the handful of power-holders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road even more fiercely counterattacked the revolutionary factions. The proletarian revolutionary factions hoped that we would come out to support them and assist them. The reactionary forces, on the other hand, hoped that we would stand by and watch them commit atrocities. In this new situation, whether or not to stand out and support the proletarian revolutionary factions in their struggle to seize power, whether to support them verbally or in action, is an important principle and a matter of stance, a severe political test for us. The People's Liberation Army, as an important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat, must stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the great waves of class struggle, actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must not compromise, reconcile, or sit on the fence. Standing by and watching the struggle is extremely wrong. In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army cannot stand aside. The issue is not whether to intervene or not, but on which side to stand, whether to support the proletarian revolutionary factions or the conservative factions, even the rightists.

To make a revolution, one must be bold and fearless. Some people worry that if we stand out to support the proletarian revolutionary factions, we will invite trouble and affect the stability of the troops. We believe that this idea is wrong and reflects a fear of the masses and a fear of revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." When we stand out to support the proletarian revolutionary factions, the revolutionary masses come to us to report situations and discuss problems. This is the masses' trust in us, a great opportunity for us to serve the people. To support the proletarian revolutionary factions, we must actively seek "trouble" and dare to take risks. If the reactionary forces come to cause trouble, this shows that we are right, being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. The idea that it will affect the stability of the troops is groundless. Chairman Mao says, "The army must blend with the people, making the army seen as their own by the people, then this army will be invincible." The facts are exactly like this. When we firmly stand out, go among the people, and demonstrate our political stance with actual actions, we gain the full trust of the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary masses stand firmly with us. In this way, the stability of the troops is not weakened but strengthened. We should see that the People's Liberation Army, standing firmly with the proletarian revolutionary factions, seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, is the only way to fundamentally consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. At the same time, being tempered and tested in the great waves of class struggle will greatly promote the ideological revolutionization of the broad officers and soldiers, enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops. Our troops will then be invincible.

II

An important experience of the victory of the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanxi is the implementation of the "three-in-one combination" of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and the People's Liberation Army. In the struggle to unite and seize power, the People's Liberation Army played a very important role.

We followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "put politics in command, go among the masses, and work with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." We had extensive contact and close ties with revolutionary mass organizations. We participated in the meetings of revolutionary mass organizations, exposed the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road, and pointed out the direction of the struggle. We solemnly declared: The army is the strong backing of the revolutionary masses. We will not protect the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. They cannot use even a single bullet! Because we blended with the broad revolutionary masses, conducted investigations and research with Mao Zedong Thought, and had a better understanding of the actual situation, we could see the situation clearly, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, identify who are the revolutionary factions, who are the conservative factions, and who are the rightists, thereby supporting the true revolutionary factions.

In the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the revolutionary masses urgently need the revolutionary leading cadres to play a leading role. The revolutionary leading cadres within the Provincial Party Committee have long struggled against the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. Revolutionary leading cadres have experience in struggle, organizational abilities, and are politically mature. Their coming out to fight alongside the revolutionary factions is very necessary and extremely beneficial for overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and for the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize and hold power. However, due to the enemy's slander and provocation, saying they have "personal ambitions" and "want to stage a coup," and using various means to cause trouble, their revolutionary activities encountered difficulties. In this situation, we actively contacted them, supporting them to come out and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and providing convenience for their revolutionary activities. At the same time, we introduced their situation to the revolutionary masses, exposed the enemy's slander and provocation, and dispelled the revolutionary masses' doubts and distrust of the revolutionary leading cadres. In this way, we created favorable conditions for the revolutionary leading cadres to participate in the great alliance and implement the "three-in-one combination."

Power seizure must have the active participation of the broad revolutionary cadres within the party and government organs. Only then can the power machinery of the proletariat truly operate. We went to the party and government organs, working with the revolutionary rebels to mobilize thoughts, promoting the development of revolutionary forces within the organs.

Because we formed a broad alliance with the revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and the broad revolutionary cadres within the party and government organs, we quickly established a unified and centralized command center for the revolutionary factions, forming a strong leadership core.

In the process of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the People's Liberation Army fully played the role of the mainstay of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Where the revolutionary factions needed support, we went there to assist, responding immediately when called. The broad officers and soldiers, with deep hatred for the class enemies, expressed to the revolutionary factions: "We are heart to heart with you, we will climb the mountain of knives with you, and we will rush into the sea of fire with you!"

In the process of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to prevent the enemy from causing trouble and ensure the normal operation of production and work, we implemented military control over some key departments of the dictatorship and important units related to the national economy and people's livelihood, or dispatched a small number of duty troops to patrol day and night. This measure strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat and maintained the revolutionary order.

The People's Liberation Army also directly participated in the power seizure struggle of some units. In some units where the reactionary forces were rampant, we dispatched armed troops to work with the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass organizations of the unit to seize power. In some important units where the revolutionary forces had not yet taken the upper hand, we dispatched troops to take over first, supervising them to carry out normal work and production, while helping to develop revolutionary forces and prepare conditions for implementing the "three-in-one combination" and united power seizure. For units with serious leadership issues but not necessarily needing to seize power, we dispatched representatives to assist the revolutionary masses and revolutionary leading cadres in gradually reforming the leadership. In the power seizure struggle, we fully utilized the role of the militia.

We also organized propaganda teams to go to factories, schools, streets, and rural areas, propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Chairman Mao's call to support the broad masses of the left, launching a powerful political offensive. This inspired the fighting will of the revolutionary factions, struck down the reactionary momentum of the enemy, and promoted the split and dissolution of conservative organizations.

Through the above work, we played the role of propagating, organizing, and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening public opinion preparation for the power seizure by the revolutionary factions, expanding the leftist forces, winning over the intermediate masses, striking and isolating the rightists, promoting the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and ensuring the victory of the "three-in-one combination" and united power seizure.

III

The victory of the power seizure struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is only the first step of the long march. To consolidate and develop the victory, we firmly support the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters in focusing on three aspects of work: strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, seizing the revolution and promoting production, and helping revolutionary mass organizations to rectify their work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our state system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to safeguard the victory of the people's revolution and to oppose the plots of restoration by internal and external enemies. We must firmly grasp this weapon." To strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, we implemented military control over the original Provincial Public Security Bureau, courts, and procuratorates and other dictatorship organs. We also formed a "Proletarian Dictatorship Committee" consisting of representatives from the revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres of the judicial departments, and the People's Liberation Army, to uniformly exercise all the powers of the original Provincial Public Security Bureau, courts, and procuratorates. This organizational form is a great creation of the revolutionary masses, a new thing that emerged in the power seizure struggle, an institution that can fully play the revolutionary authority, and a good form of exercising the functions of the proletarian dictatorship.

We must firmly implement the dictatorship against counter-revolutionaries, allowing them to behave only in an orderly manner and not to make trouble. All reactionary organizations must be immediately disbanded. For the leaders of reactionary organizations, we follow the Party's consistent policy: confess and be lenient, resist and be strict; punish the ringleaders, do not question the coerced; reward those who make contributions. For the masses who have been deceived, we strengthen political education to win them back to the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat. These measures quickly produced remarkable results. This is an important reason why the temporary power organs established by the proletarian revolutionary factions after seizing power were consolidated, and the new revolutionary order was established.

We took active measures to implement Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," ensuring the normal operation of industrial and agricultural production. In some units and places where the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power, we helped the revolutionary factions establish two sets of leadership, one for revolution and one for production, focusing on revolution and promoting production. In some counties and cities where the leading organs were still controlled by the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and the revolutionary factions had not yet seized power, the county and city military departments and the revolutionary factions jointly took over the production power first, organized and led production. We also called on the broad officers and soldiers to seize every possible opportunity to participate directly in industrial and agricultural production labor, propagating the Party's policies, and doing ideological and political work for the masses. These efforts played an active role in the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions and in ensuring the development of production.

In the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the proletarian revolutionary factions, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, carried out a mass rectification campaign, overcoming the erroneous thoughts of localism, sectarianism, factionalism, dispersion, non-organizational views, and ultra-democracy within their own minds and organizations. These erroneous thoughts, in essence, are the anarchist trend of thought. This trend of thought dissolves the great alliance of the revolutionary factions and impacts the dictatorship of the proletariat. If not overcome, it is very dangerous. When the revolutionary mass organizations carried out rectification, we dispatched a large number of political workers and propaganda teams to the masses, doing solid ideological and political work, working with the proletarian revolutionary factions to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Against Liberalism," and the "Three Articles." We rectified our thoughts, organizations, and styles: eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, seizing the power of the "self" in the mind; learning the four firsts, the three-eighths style, and the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, strengthening organizational discipline; seriously implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, raising the level of policy, and actively and consciously implementing the "three-in-one combination." Through rectification, the revolutionary factions summarized their experiences, overcame their shortcomings, and promoted ideological revolutionization. In the joint struggle with the revolutionary factions, the broad officers and soldiers also received education and tempering.

Currently, the situation in Shanxi is excellent. The revolution is developing in depth, and there are more arduous tasks awaiting us to complete. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will not easily accept defeat, and they will still make desperate struggles. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All the commanding officers and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must not relax their fighting will in the slightest. Any thought of relaxing the fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, welcome the new battles, and achieve new victories!

    坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争
    中国人民解放军山西省军区政治委员　张日清
    正当无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新阶段，无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席发出了人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召。我们山西省军区的全体指战员，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，满腔热情地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持了无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，履行了党和人民赋予我们的保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政的光荣职责，在伟大的夺权斗争中，做出了贡献。
    一          
    中国人民解放军，是毛主席亲手缔造的无产阶级军队，“是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大搏斗。坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派，是人民解放军责无旁贷的神圣义务。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，我们积极响应毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，密切注意阶级斗争形势的发展，结合文化大革命中的现实问题，学习了毛主席的有关著作。我们用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，认识到山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来，猖狂地进行资本主义复辟的活动，妄图把山西变成复辟资本主义的独立王国。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，妄图把革命的群众运动打下去，继续维持他们的反动统治。
    在文化大革命以前，我们和省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作过长期的斗争。从无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们曾几次企图把我们拉过去，企图利用人民解放军的崇高威信，蒙蔽群众，保护自己，镇压革命派，转移斗争大方向，破坏解放军的声誉。我们识破了他们的阴谋，拒绝了他们的要求，从而支持和保护了无产阶级革命派。
    文化大革命发展到无产阶级革命派联合起来夺权的新阶段，山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派更是变本加厉地对革命派进行疯狂反扑。无产阶级革命派希望我们出来支持他们，援助他们。而反动势力则又妄想我们袖手旁观，任他们行凶作恶。在这种新的形势下，要不要站出来支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争，是口头上支持还是行动上支持，是一个重要的原则问题，立场问题，是对我们的一场严峻的政治考验。人民解放军作为无产阶级专政的重要工具，在阶级斗争的大风浪中，必须旗帜鲜明，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，主动地投入到无产阶级文化大革命中来。不能折中，不能调和，不能骑墙。袖手旁观，坐山观虎斗，是极端错误的。在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，人民解放军是不能不介入的。问题不是介入不介入的问题，而是站在哪一边的问题，是支持无产阶级革命派，还是支持保守派甚至右派的问题。
    干革命，必须“敢”字当头，去掉“怕”字。有人担心，我们站出来支持无产阶级革命派，会引火上门，招惹麻烦，影响部队的稳定。我们认为，这种想法是错误的，是害怕群众、害怕革命的表现。毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们站出来支持无产阶级革命派，革命群众找我们反映情况，商量问题，这是群众对我们的信任，是我们为人民服务的大好机会。为了支持无产阶级革命派，我们就是要自找“麻烦”，敢担风险。反动势力要来捣乱，这正说明我们做对了，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。所谓会影响部队稳定的想法，是没有根据的。毛主席说，“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。事实正是这样。当我们坚决站出来，到群众中去，并用实际行动表明自己政治态度的时候，就取得了革命群众的充分信任，革命群众和我们坚定地站在一起了。这样，部队的稳定不是削弱了，而是增强了。应该看到，人民解放军和无产阶级革命派紧紧站在一起，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里把权夺过来，才能从根本上巩固无产阶级专政。同时，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里经受考验和锻炼，会大大促进广大指战员的思想革命化，提高部队战斗力，我们的部队就会无敌于天下。
    二
    山西省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争胜利的一条重要经验，是实行了革命群众组织、革命领导干部和人民解放军的“三结合”。在联合夺权的斗争中，人民解放军起了很重要的作用。
    我们遵照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的指示，同革命群众组织广泛接触，密切联系。我们参加革命群众组织的会议，揭露省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，指明斗争的大方向。我们郑重宣布：解放军是革命群众的坚强后盾，我们决不保护一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们要调用一枪一弹都不行！由于我们同广大革命群众打成一片，用毛泽东思想进行调查研究，对实际情况比较了解，就能够看清形势，分清敌我，判明谁是革命派，谁是保守派，谁是右派，从而支持真正的革命派。
    在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争中，革命群众很需要革命领导干部起骨干作用和领导作用。省委内的革命领导干部，长期同一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。革命领导干部，有斗争经验，有组织能力，政治上比较成熟。他们站出来同革命派一起战斗，对于打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对于无产阶级革命派夺权和掌权，是十分必要和极其有利的。可是，由于敌人进行造谣挑拨，说他们有“个人野心”、“要搞政变”等等，并且采取各种手段进行捣乱，使他们的革命活动遭到困难。在这种情况下，我们便主动同他们联系，支持他们站出来揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并给他们的革命活动提供方便。同时，向革命群众介绍他们的情况，揭露敌人造谣挑拨的阴谋，消除革命群众对革命领导干部的某些怀疑和不信任情绪。这样，就为革命领导干部参加大联合，实现“三结合”创造了有利的条件。
    夺权必须有党政机关内广大革命干部的积极参加。这样才能使无产阶级权力机器真正运转起来。我们到党政机关中去，同革命造反派一起，进行思想发动，促进了机关内部革命力量的发展。
    由于我们同革命群众组织、革命领导干部以及党政机关内的广大革命干部结成了广泛的大联合，就很快地建立了革命派的统一的集中的指挥部，形成了坚强的领导核心。
    在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权过程中，人民解放军充分发挥了无产阶级专政的中流砥柱的作用。革命派那里需要，我们就到那里去支援，随叫随到。广大指战员怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，向革命派表示：我们和你们心连心，刀山和你们一起上，火海和你们一起闯！
    在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权过程中，为了防止敌人破坏，保证生产和工作的正常进行，我们对一些专政的要害部门和有关国计民生的重要单位，实行了军事管制，或者派出少量值勤部队，日夜巡逻。这一措施，加强了无产阶级专政，维护了革命秩序。
    人民解放军还有重点地直接参加一些单位的夺权斗争。在有些反动势力嚣张的单位，我们派出武装部队，同本单位的革命领导干部和革命群众组织一起，进行夺权斗争。在一些革命力量尚未占优势的重要单位，我们派部队先行接管，督促他们进行正常工作和生产，同时，帮助发展革命力量，为实行“三结合”、联合夺权准备条件。对领导班子问题严重，但还不一定需要夺权的单位，则派出代表，协助革命群众和革命领导干部，逐步改组领导班子。在夺权斗争中，我们充分发挥了民兵的作用。
    我们还组织宣传队，到工厂、学校、街头、农村，宣传毛主席的革命路线，宣传毛主席对人民解放军发出的要支持左派广大群众的号召，开展了强有力的政治攻势，鼓舞了革命派的斗争意志，打击了敌人的反动气焰，促进了保守派组织的分化瓦解。
    我们通过以上几个方面的工作，起了用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众的作用，为革命派夺权加强了舆论准备，壮大了左派队伍，争取了中间群众，打击和孤立了右派，促进了无产阶级革命派的大联合，保证了“三结合”、联合夺权的胜利。
    三
    向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权斗争的胜利，只是万里长征走完了第一步。为了巩固胜利和发展胜利，我们坚决支持山西省革命造反总指挥部着重抓三方面的工作：加强无产阶级专政；抓革命，促生产；帮助革命群众组织整风。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”为了加强无产阶级专政，对原省公安厅、法院、检察院等专政机构，实行了军事管制。并由革命群众组织、政法部门的革命干部和人民解放军三方面的代表，组成“无产阶级专政委员会”，统一行使原省公安厅、法院、检察院的一切权力。这种组织形式，是革命群众的伟大创造，是在夺权斗争中出现的崭新的事物，是一个能充分发挥革命权威作用的机构，是行使无产阶级专政职能的一种好形式。
    对反革命分子必须坚决实行专政，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。凡属反动组织，立即取缔。对其反动组织的头目，按照党的一贯政策：坦白从宽，抗拒从严；首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖。对受蒙蔽的群众，加强政治教育，争取他们回到无产阶级革命路线一边来。这样做，迅速收到了显著的效果。这是无产阶级革命派夺权后建立的临时权力机构得以巩固，新的革命秩序得以建立的重要原因之一。
    采取积极措施，贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，保证了工农业生产的正常进行。在无产阶级革命派夺权胜利的一些单位和地方，我们帮助革命派建立起革命和生产两套班子，狠抓革命，大促生产。在领导机构还被一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派把持而革命派尚未夺权的一些县、市，则由县、市武装部门和革命派一起，先把生产大权抓过来，组织生产，领导生产。我们还号召广大指战员，利用一切可能的机会，直接参加工农业生产劳动，宣传党的方针政策，做群众的思想政治工作。这些，对于无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，对于保证生产的发展，都起了积极的作用。
    在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，无产阶级革命派以毛泽东思想为武器，开展群众性的整风，克服自己头脑中和自己组织里的本位主义、小团体主义、山头主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化等错误思想。这些错误思想，集中到一点，就是无政府主义思潮。这种思潮，瓦解革命派大联合，冲击无产阶级专政。如果不加克服，是很危险的。在革命群众组织开展整风的时候，我们派出大批政治工作人员和宣传队，到群众中去，扎扎实实地进行思想政治工作，同无产阶级革命派一道，活学活用毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、“老三篇”等光辉著作，从思想上、组织上、作风上进行整顿：破私立公，夺头脑中“私”字的权；学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律、八项注意，加强组织性纪律性；认真执行毛主席的干部政策，提高政策水平，主动地、自觉地实行“三结合”。通过整风，革命派总结经验，克服缺点，促进了思想革命化。在同革命派的并肩战斗中，广大指战员也受到了教育，得到了锻炼。
    目前，山西形势大好。革命正向纵深方向发展，还有更艰巨的任务等待我们去完成。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派决不甘心失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，迎接新的战斗，夺取新的胜利！　（原载《红旗》杂志一九六七年第四期）
