Chinese students studying in Europe and Latin America and staff from Chinese diplomatic missions, totaling nearly 200 people, who were returning home via the Soviet Union, fought bravely against the Soviet revisionist leadership's henchmen—Soviet military police and plainclothes agents—during their four-day journey from Moscow to the Soviet border station of Naustki. This journey fully demonstrated the fearless revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, terrified by the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, dispatched an entire car full of plainclothes agents to monitor the returning Chinese students and diplomatic staff. These agents roamed the train, furtively observing the Chinese passengers. The Soviet authorities also stationed large numbers of police and plainclothes agents at every station along the route. Whenever the train pulled into a station, the platform was heavily guarded, with sentries everywhere, preventing Soviet citizens from approaching the carriages and interacting with the Chinese comrades.

In the face of the aggressive Soviet henchmen, the Chinese students and diplomatic staff showed no fear. At every station, they sang "The Internationale," recited Chairman Mao's quotations, and shouted slogans such as: "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" "Eternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

On February 6, when the train arrived at the Ulan-Ude station, the platform was swarming with police and plainclothes agents, numbering in the hundreds. Several police cars drove directly onto the platform. Two Soviet army colonels and one lieutenant colonel rushed around giving orders; overhead, an airplane circled low, dropping leaflets, as if a major enemy had arrived. However, the Chinese students and diplomatic staff on the train were fearless. They loudly told the Soviet people in Russian about the Soviet authorities' heinous crimes of directing thugs in Moscow to beat up Chinese students and diplomats in Europe. They hung portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in the train windows, along with a portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They sang "The Internationale," songs of Mao's quotations, and Soviet revolutionary songs. The Soviet people on the platform, despite the obstruction by Soviet police, rushed to the carriages, gazing affectionately at Chairman Mao's portrait, listening to the revolutionary songs sung by the Chinese students, and hearing their condemnation of the fascist atrocities of the Soviet ruling clique. A young Soviet saw the portrait of Chairman Mao in the window and took out a book from his bag, showing a page with a picture of Lenin to the Chinese comrades, and holding the picture of Lenin next to Chairman Mao's, expressing his boundless admiration for Chairman Mao. A young couple shouted to the Chinese comrades, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Salute to Beijing!"

At this moment, a Soviet colonel, enraged, hurriedly ordered the agents to disperse the crowd and had the station's loudspeakers blare jazz music, directing a group of hooligans to dance wildly on the platform. However, all these despicable tricks were not only drowned out by the powerful songs and loud slogans of the Chinese students and diplomatic staff but also aroused strong dissatisfaction among the Soviet people present. These Soviet henchmen appeared very small in the face of the Chinese people armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. They failed miserably and had no choice but to move the train forward nearly 100 meters, declaring the failure of their plots.

The Chinese train conductor, in response to the serious incident of the Soviet authorities deliberately causing a delay of nearly two hours at this station, lodged a strong protest with the Soviet train conductor, condemning the despicable actions of the Soviet authorities. The Soviet train conductor, under the strong and righteous protest of the Chinese side, was in a state of disarray and had nothing to say.

Our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no power to be feared." The various despicable tricks played by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Chinese students and our diplomatic staff during their journey once again exposed their reactionary nature and weakness.

    中国人民大无畏革命精神使苏修丧胆
    我留学生和驻外人员不顾苏修警察阻挠在归国途中坚持英勇斗争
    苏修派出大批军警特务并在沿途车站密布岗哨监视我归国人员
    据新华社九日讯　路经苏联回国的我国在欧洲、拉丁美洲各国学习的留学生和我国驻外机构工作人员近二百人，二月二日从莫斯科乘车到苏联边境车站——纳乌斯基的四天旅途中，同苏联修正主义领导集团的爪牙——苏修军警和便衣特务进行了英勇的斗争，充分表现了用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的大无畏的革命精神。
    被中国人民的革命精神吓破了胆的苏修领导集团为了监视回国的我国留学生和驻外机构人员，调派了整整一车厢的便衣特务随行。这些人在车上来回乱串，鬼鬼祟祟地窥视着中国乘客的行动。苏修当局还在沿途各个车站上布置了大批警察和便衣特务。每当列车驶进车站时，站台上都是戒备森严，岗哨密布，不许苏联老百姓接近车厢，同中国同志接触。
    中国学生和驻外人员在气势汹汹的苏修爪牙面前毫不畏惧。他们每到一个车站就高唱《国际歌》，齐声朗读毛主席语录，高呼：“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“中苏两国人民的友谊万古长青！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    二月六日，当列车到达乌兰乌德车站时，车站上的警察和便衣特务布置得密密麻麻，达数百人之多，好几辆警车直接驶入站台。两名苏军中校军官和一名苏军少校军官跑来跑去忙着指挥；车站上空还有飞机低空盘旋，大量散发传单，真象大敌临头一样。然而，在列车上的中国学生和驻外人员毫不畏惧，他们用俄语大声向苏联群众讲述苏修当局在莫斯科指使暴徒殴打我国留欧学生和外交人员的滔天罪行。他们在车厢窗子上悬挂起马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的画像，悬挂起中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的照片。他们高唱《国际歌》、毛主席语录歌以及苏联革命歌曲。车站上的苏联群众，不顾苏修警察的阻拦，拥到车厢跟前，满含深情地注视着毛主席的照片、倾听着中国留学生唱的革命歌曲和他们对苏修统治集团的法西斯暴行的谴责。一个苏联青年人看到车窗上悬挂的毛主席照片后，走到车厢前从提包中拿出一本书，翻到印有列宁照片的一页，指给中国同志看，并且把列宁的照片举在毛主席照片的旁边，表达他对毛主席的无限崇敬。一对年轻夫妇向中国同志喊出：“毛泽东万岁！”“向北京致敬！”的口号。
    这时，一个苏军中校气急败坏地赶忙命令特务们驱散人群，并且让车站扩音器大放爵士音乐，指使一批流氓阿飞在车站上大跳摇摆舞。然而所有这一切丑恶的伎俩不仅被中国学生和驻外人员的雄壮的歌声和响亮的口号声所压倒，而且引起了在场的苏联人民的强烈的不满。这群苏修爪牙在战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民面前显得十分渺小，他们弄巧成拙，无计可施，最后只得把列车向前开了将近一百米，宣告他们的阴谋诡计的破产。
    列车上的中方列车长就苏修当局在这个车站上故意制造晚点近两小时的严重事件，向苏方列车长提出了严重抗议，谴责苏修当局的卑劣行径。苏方列车长在我义正词严的强烈抗议下狼狈不堪，无言以对。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”苏修领导集团对中国留学生和我驻外人员，在旅途中施展的种种卑鄙无耻的伎俩，又一次暴露了他们的反动面目和虚弱本质。
