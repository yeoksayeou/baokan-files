Two students from Congo (Brazzaville) studying in Cuba rushed to obtain a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" as soon as they heard that it had arrived in Havana. They were so excited that they didn't even bother to attend their classes. After receiving the book, one of the students said, "When will we be able to see Chairman Mao? We miss him so much. The people of Congo (Brazzaville) respect him greatly because Chairman Mao's words are all truth."

    句句是真理
    在古巴学习的两位刚果（布）学生，一听到《毛主席语录》运到哈瓦那的消息，连课都顾不得上，就赶来向中国同志索取这本红宝书。当他俩拿到《毛主席语录》以后，都非常激动。其中一位学生说：“什么时候我们才能见到毛主席呢？我们非常想念他。我们刚果（布）人民都非常尊敬他，因为毛主席的话句句是真理。”
