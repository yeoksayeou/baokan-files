	Twenty Heroic and Model Units of a Certain Division of the Guangzhou Military Region Jointly Pledge to Chairman Mao

	Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 3rd — Twenty heroic and model units of a certain division of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army jointly wrote a pledge to our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and to resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary factions who are charging into battle. The full text of the pledge is as follows:

	Most, most beloved Chairman Mao:

	We, the soldiers and officers of twenty units of a certain division of the Guangzhou Military Region, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary combat salute to you, the reddest red sun in our hearts!

	Under your brilliant leadership, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is sweeping the nation and shaking the world, has entered a new stage. Revolutionary rebels across the country are uniting in a mighty force, with the power of a thousand thunderstorms and the might of ten thousand horses, to denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, to denounce the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and to denounce the stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. They are waging a comprehensive struggle to seize power. This power must be seized! It is just and righteous! It is a great victory for the people!

	Beloved Chairman Mao, at this critical moment of class struggle, we must read your books more diligently, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We must stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary factions who are charging into battle, guard our combat positions, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Beloved Chairman Mao, we are the revolutionary army you personally created, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Following your teachings on class and class struggle, we resolutely respond to your great call, taking the most revolutionary and active actions to implement and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, and fully support the revolutionary leftists. We are your loyal soldiers; our people's army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat! At this crucial moment of intense class struggle, we will stand up without hesitation and firmly intervene in this struggle. Against the class enemy's "sugar-coated bullets," we will launch a resolute counterattack! Against the class enemy's "white terror," we will launch a resolute suppression!

	You taught us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This wise judgment, we will always keep in our hearts. For decades, under your personal leadership and command, our Chinese People's Liberation Army, tightly grasping the gun, has fought south and north, shedding blood and sacrificing lives, together with the revolutionary people of the whole country, seizing power from the hands of the three great enemies. Today, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line have usurped power in the places and departments they occupy, implementing bourgeois dictatorship. If we do not seize power from their hands, our party and state will change color, the Chinese people will suffer, and the world's people will suffer. We will not allow this! We will not allow this! We will resolutely use the gun to support the revolutionary leftists and seize back the power usurped by the power-holders taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line.

	Beloved Chairman Mao, a thousand words cannot express our determination. We solemnly pledge to you: We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought; we will defend you and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you to the death! Whoever dares to oppose you, we will resolutely destroy them!

	Finally, we sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

	Twenty Heroic and Model Units of a Certain Division of the Guangzhou Military Region:

	Permanent Line Maintenance Company, Pioneer Battalion, Heroic Crossing Battalion, Heroic Huangcaoling Battalion, Spearhead Heroic Battalion, Heroic Pulancheng Battalion, Heroic Zhengjiagui Battalion, Heroic Qingyunmian Battalion, Heroic Yantai Peak Battalion, Heroic Eagle Peak Mountain Battalion, Heroic Panlongshan Battalion, Heroic Baolongli Garrison Battalion, Heroic Zhongjiaxi Battalion, Heroic Niujiaofeng Battalion, Heroic Tenacious Charge Battalion, Heroic Panjiayu Battalion, Heroic Tuanshanzi Battalion, Combat Model Battalion, Heroic Strong Victory Battalion, Heroic Tiger Spearhead Battalion

	January 28, 1967

    广州部队某部二十个英雄模范单位联名
    给毛主席的宣誓信
    新华社广州三日电　中国人民解放军广州部队某部二十个英雄模范单位，联名给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席写了宣誓信，表示坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持正在冲锋陷阵的无产阶级革命派。宣誓信全文如下：最最敬爱的毛主席：
      我们广州部队某部二十个单位的指战员，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，致以最最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
      目前席卷全国、震动世界的无产阶级文化大革命，在您的英明领导下，已经进入了一个新的阶段。全国的革命造反派实行大联合，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反，大造一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的反，展开了全面的夺权斗争。这个权夺得好！夺得有理！夺得大快人心！
      敬爱的毛主席，在这场阶级斗争的紧要关头，我们一定要更好地读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，坚决站在以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，最坚决地支持正在冲锋陷阵的无产阶级革命派，坚守战斗岗位，百倍提高警惕，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们是您亲手缔造的革命军队，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士。我们按照您关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，坚决响应您的伟大号召，以最革命最积极的行动贯彻执行和保卫以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线，全力支持革命左派。我们是您的忠诚战士，我们人民军队是无产阶级专政的柱石！在这场严峻的阶级斗争的关键时刻，我们坚决挺身而出，毫不含糊地介入这场斗争，对于阶级敌人的“糖衣炮弹”，我们坚决反击！对于阶级敌人的“白色恐怖”，我们坚决镇压！
    您教导我们说：“枪杆子里面出政权。”这个英明的论断，我们什么时候都牢牢记在心中。几十年来，我们中国人民解放军在您的亲自领导和指挥下，紧握枪杆子，南征北战，不惜流血牺牲，和全国革命人民一道，从三大敌人手里夺取了政权。今天，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在他们盘踞的地方和部门篡了权，实行资产阶级专政。如果不从他们手里把权夺过来，我们的党和国家就会改变颜色，中国人民就要遭殃，世界人民就要遭殃。我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！我们坚决用枪杆子支持革命左派，把走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子篡夺的权夺回来。
    敬爱的毛主席，千言万语表达不尽我们的决心。我们庄严地向您宣誓：永远忠于您，永远忠于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想；誓死保卫您和以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线；谁敢反对您，我们就坚决把它消灭！
    最后，衷心地祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
