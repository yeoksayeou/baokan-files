At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward in the rural areas of Shanghai, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have hatched a new plot. Under their direction, some cadres who committed serious errors during the Four Cleanups Movement and were removed from office by the revolutionary masses, along with local class enemies, have joined forces to stir up a counterrevolutionary wind. They completely deny the great achievements of the Four Cleanups Movement, directing their arrows at the ordinary members of the Four Cleanups Work Teams and the poor and lower-middle peasants who are active in the movement.

This counterrevolutionary wind has blown to the Construction Brigade of Huacao Commune in Shanghai County, where class revenge incidents have occurred one after another. Some seriously corrupt cadres and class enemies are stirring. They completely negate the achievements of the Four Cleanups Movement, shouting wildly that the "Twenty-three Articles" are wrong and that "it's time to vent our anger." They drag back members of the Four Cleanups Work Teams, insult and beat them at will, struggle against the poor and lower-middle peasants who are active in the Four Cleanups Movement, and force the work team members to reverse their cases.

This is intolerable! The revolutionary rebels of the Construction Brigade have firmly stood up and immediately given those who attempt to launch a counterattack a resounding blow. They said: The Four Cleanups Movement was initiated by our great leader Chairman Mao. The "Twenty-three Articles" that guide the Four Cleanups Movement were personally presided over by Chairman Mao and are great Marxist-Leninist documents. The movement exposed a batch of seriously corrupt cadres, pushed them aside, and removed them from their positions, striking at landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, as well as class enemies. The general direction is completely correct. Through the Four Cleanups Movement, a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has surged in the countryside, and the class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants has been greatly enhanced. The slogan "Farming for Revolution" has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Due to the high socialist production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, a great harvest in agriculture was achieved in 1966, and the collective economy has been further consolidated. These achievements are absolutely not allowed to be denied, and these great achievements of the Four Cleanups Movement, we must resolutely defend. Whoever tries to launch a counterattack, we will fight to the end.

The revolutionary rebels here also said, the ordinary members of the Four Cleanups Work Teams are all revolutionary masses. Most of them eat, live, and work with us poor and lower-middle peasants, and their hearts are connected with ours. Whoever tries to sow discord between us poor and lower-middle peasants and the work team members, and incite the masses to fight the masses, we will not agree! They said, during the Four Cleanups Movement, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line on some work teams, some mistakes were made. Some work teams were controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, so the movement was not thorough, especially at the county and commune levels, where the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were not exposed. This responsibility cannot be borne by the ordinary work team members. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside requires a review and supplementary class struggle of the Four Cleanups Movement, which is to expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who were not exposed during the Four Cleanups Movement, and to expose and overthrow the class enemies. This is the direction of the struggle, and we must not fall for the enemy's tricks and change the direction of the struggle.

A corrupt element in the Construction Brigade attempted to reverse his case, but the poor and lower-middle peasants pushed him back. They said: The Four Cleanups Movement exposed some corrupt cadres. Whether there were any mistakes, we poor and lower-middle peasants know best. If it's a real case, we will not allow it to be reversed; if it's a false case, we will definitely reverse it. The class enemies want to fish in troubled waters and launch a counterattack, which is absolutely not allowed.

After a struggle, the eyes of the revolutionary rebels and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Construction Brigade have become clearer, and the counterrevolutionary wind of dragging back members of the Four Cleanups Work Teams has been stopped. Now, the revolutionary rebels and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Construction Brigade are following the correct direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the class enemies.

    保卫四清运动成果，掌握斗争大方向
    华漕公社建设大队革命农民揭穿一小撮坏家伙挑动群众揪工作队员的新阴谋，迎头痛击敌人的新反扑
    本报讯　正当无产阶级文化大革命在上海郊区农村蓬勃兴起的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派又耍了新阴谋。在他们指使下，一些在四清运动中犯下严重错误被革命群众罢了官的干部和当地的牛鬼蛇神纠合在一起，刮起了一股反攻倒算的歪风。他们一笔抹杀四清运动的伟大成果，把矛头指向四清工作队一般队员，指向四清运动中的贫下中农积极分子。
    这股歪风，刮到了上海县华漕公社建设大队，阶级报复事件连续发生。一些严重四不清的干部和牛鬼蛇神蠢蠢欲动。他们全盘否定四清运动成果，猖狂地叫喊什么“‘二十三条’是错误的”，叫喊“出气的时候到了”。他们揪回四清工作队队员，任意辱骂殴打，斗争四清运动中的贫下中农积极分子，威逼工作队队员为他们翻案。
    是可忍，孰不可忍！建设大队的农民革命造反派坚定地站出来，立即给了那些企图反攻倒算的家伙一个迎头痛击。他们说：四清运动是我们伟大领袖毛主席发起的，指导四清运动的“二十三条”，是毛主席亲自主持制定的，是伟大的马克思列宁主义的文件。运动中清出了一批严重四不清干部，叫他们靠了边，下了台，打击了没有改造好的地富反坏右分子和牛鬼蛇神，大方向是完全正确的。经过四清运动，一个活学活用毛主席著作的高潮在农村中掀起来了，贫下中农的阶级觉悟有了很大提高。“为革命种田”的口号深入人心。由于广大农民的社会主义生产积极性高涨，取得了一九六六年农业大丰收，集体经济获得进一步巩固。这些成绩是绝不容许抹杀的，这些四清运动的伟大成果，我们要坚决保卫。谁要反攻倒算，我们就和他拚到底。
    这里的革命造反派还说，四清工作队一般队员都是革命群众，他们中间大多数人和我们贫下中农吃在一起，住在一起，劳动在一起，和我们贫下中农心连心。谁想挑拨我们贫下中农和工作队员的关系，挑动群众斗群众，我们决不答应！他们说，四清运动中，由于一些工作队受了资产阶级反动路线的影响，产生了一些缺点错误，有些工作队被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派控制，因而运动搞得很不彻底，特别是县和公社两级没有很好触动，那里的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派没有揪出来，这个责任不能由一般工作队员来负。农村中的无产阶级文化大革命，要进行四清运动的复查补课，就是要把四清运动中没有揪出来的党内走资本主义道路当权派揪出来，把牛鬼蛇神揪出来，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。这是斗争大方向，我们绝不能上敌人的当，转移斗争大方向。
    建设四队一个贪污分子妄图翻案，贫下中农把他顶了回去。他们说：四清运动清理出来一些四不清干部，有没有搞错，我们贫下中农最清楚。是真案子，我们决不准翻；是假案子，我们一定会翻。阶级敌人妄想混水摸鱼，反攻倒算，万万办不到。
    经过一番斗争，建设大队革命造反派和贫下中农的眼睛更亮了，揪四清工作队队员的歪风刹住了。现在，建设大队的革命造反派和贫下中农，正沿着无产阶级文化大革命的正确方向，跟党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和牛鬼蛇神进行坚决斗争。
