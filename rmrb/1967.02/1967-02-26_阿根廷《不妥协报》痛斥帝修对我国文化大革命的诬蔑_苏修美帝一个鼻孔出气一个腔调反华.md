According to Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires: The Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization's organ, "Uncompromising News," recently published an article enthusiastically praising our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The article states: Mao Zedong Thought has shown the Chinese Communist Party and all communists in the world that class struggle exists in socialist society; after the proletariat seizes power and establishes the material foundation of socialism, if they do not carry out a cultural revolution to consolidate their political and economic power, the bourgeoisie will engage in counter-revolutionary activities to overthrow the political and economic power of socialism, preparing for and realizing the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, the cultural revolution is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The article says, under the personal direction of Comrade Mao Zedong, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" is "an outstanding document. All communists who wish to understand the origins and development of the cultural revolution must study this document. This document summarizes the content of a stage of the socialist revolution." "The great cause initiated by the Chinese Communist Party is unprecedented in human history."

The article then denounces the imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, who are playing the shameful role of the American imperialists' mercenaries, for their malicious slander against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The article says: "In the past, social democrats were old accomplices of imperialism in attacking Lenin and Stalin's Soviet Union, and today, Soviet revisionists have become new accomplices of American imperialism in attacking the Chinese revolution." "The Soviet revisionists have gone even further than American imperialism in defending bourgeois culture and denigrating proletarian culture."

The article points out: "The reactionaries' hatred for the proletariat is inseparable from their hatred for its leaders, and revolutionaries' love for the proletariat is inseparable from their love for its leaders." "Lenin studied the experience of the Paris Commune's failure, pointing out how the working class can seize power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, imperialists and social democrats both hate him. Mao Zedong studied the lessons of the failure of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, pointing out how the proletariat can consolidate its dictatorship, prevent the success of revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, imperialists and revisionists both hate him." The article emphasizes that, however, the people love the greatest proletarian revolutionary, Mao Zedong.

The article concludes by saying, all those who oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will never dare to mobilize the masses in their own countries as the People's Republic of China does. "Seven hundred million Chinese people, under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, are transforming into true communists, becoming an invincible bulwark of the world revolution."

    阿根廷《不妥协报》痛斥帝修对我国文化大革命的诬蔑
    苏修美帝一个鼻孔出气一个腔调反华
    据新华社讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报《不妥协报》最近发表文章，热情赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    文章说：毛泽东思想给中国共产党和世界上所有的共产党人指出，社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争；无产阶级一旦夺取政权并且建立了社会主义的物质基础以后，如果不开展文化革命来巩固自己的政治和经济权力，资产阶级就要进行反革命活动来推翻社会主义的政治和经济权力，为修正主义的得逞作好准备和实现资本主义复辟。因此，文化革命是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    文章说，在毛泽东同志亲自主持下制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，是“一个非常杰出的文件，一切共产党人要想了解文化革命的来历和发展情况必须学习这个文件。这个文件概括了社会主义革命一个阶段的内容。”“中国共产党人开创的这个伟大的事业在人类历史上还是第一次。”
    文章接着痛斥帝国主义者和正在充当美帝国主义别动队这个可耻角色的苏联修正主义领导集团对中国文化大革命的恶毒诬蔑。文章说：“过去社会民主党人是帝国主义攻击列宁和斯大林的苏联的老帮凶，同样，今天苏联修正主义者成了美帝国主义攻击中国革命的新帮凶。”“苏联修正主义者在维护资产阶级文化和诋毁无产阶级文化方面走得比美帝国主义还远。”
    文章指出：“反动派对无产阶级的仇恨是同对它的领袖的仇恨分不开的，革命者对无产阶级的热爱是同对它的领袖的热爱也是分不开的。”“列宁研究了巴黎公社失败的经验，指出工人阶级怎样才能夺取政权和建立无产阶级专政。因此，帝国主义和社会民主党人都仇恨他。毛泽东研究苏联无产阶级专政失败的教训，指出无产阶级怎样才能巩固自己的专政、防止修正主义得逞和资本主义复辟，因此帝国主义和修正主义都仇视他。”文章强调指出，但是，人民热爱最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛泽东。
    文章最后说，所有敌视无产阶级文化革命的人，永远也不敢象中华人民共和国那样在自己国内放手发动群众。“七亿中国人民在毛泽东思想教育下正在改造成为真正的共产主义者，成为世界革命的不可战胜的堡垒。”
