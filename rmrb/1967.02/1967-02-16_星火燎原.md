    Spark into a Prairie Fire

    “A single spark can start a prairie fire.”

    Chairman Mao’s scientific judgment on the situation of the Chinese revolution made over thirty years ago is also a realistic reflection of the revolutionary situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America today.

    The oppressed peoples of the Asian, African, and Latin American countries have come to understand the truth of “political power grows out of the barrel of a gun” from Chairman Mao’s brilliant works. From the valuable experience of the Chinese revolution, they have found the path to victory in national liberation through armed struggle. They are now taking up arms to resolutely fight against imperialism and its lackeys.

    Although the armed struggles in these regions are still just sparks today, they are the fires of revolution, justice, and hope.

    The Asia-Africa-Latin America region is the focal point of world contradictions, an important battlefield where the oppressed peoples are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. There, dry wood is piled everywhere. Once the flames of armed struggle are ignited, they will inevitably spread like a prairie fire.

    Chairman Mao said: “Revolutionary parties and forces are always in the minority at the beginning, but they are the ones with the brightest future.” The patriotic guerrilla fighters in the Asia-Africa-Latin America region, though still in a weak position today and facing numerous difficulties, will definitely grow from small to large and from weak to strong, accumulating small victories into great victories, and use the gun to fight for a people’s heaven on earth, as long as they rely on the people and persist in the struggle.

    星火燎原
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”
    毛主席三十多年前对中国革命形势所作的这个科学论断，也是今天亚非拉各国革命形势的现实写照。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的被压迫人民，从毛主席的光辉著作中认识到了“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，从中国革命的宝贵经验中找到了通过武装斗争争取民族解放的胜利道路。他们正在拿起枪杆子，同帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争。
    虽然这些地区的武装斗争现在还只是星星之火，但它们是革命之火，正义之火，希望之火。
    亚非拉地区是世界矛盾的焦点，是被压迫人民同帝国主义殖民主义搏斗的重要阵地，那里到处都布满了干柴，一旦点燃起武装斗争的烽火，就必然要发展成为燎原之势。
    毛主席说：“革命政党和力量，在开始时都是处于少数地位的，但最有前途的就是他们。”亚非拉地区的爱国游击战士们，今天虽然还处于弱小的地位，还面临着重重的困难，但是，只要他们依靠人民，坚持斗争，就一定会由小到大，由弱到强，积小胜为大胜，用枪杆子打出一个人民的天下来。
