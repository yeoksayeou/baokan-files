The crew of the Guanghua ship, which is on its way to Indonesia to repatriate Chinese nationals, held a meeting on January 28 on board the ship to angrily denounce the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists in their bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe.

The crew members and the personnel on board responsible for repatriating Chinese nationals, who are on the front lines of the international class struggle, were filled with indignation upon hearing the news of the Soviet revisionists' bloody suppression of our students in Europe. At the denunciation meeting, the crew members and the repatriation personnel spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their strongest support for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's most vehement protest against the Soviet government's bloody suppression of our students in Europe. The crew members sternly warned the Soviet revisionist scoundrels: Those who suppress revolutionary students will meet a bad end. Chairman Mao teaches us, "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and it will certainly be victorious, whether sooner or later." Your days as revisionist scoundrels are numbered. The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will surely rise up against you, and your fate will be the same as that of the tsars and Khrushchev—you will be thrown into the garbage heap of history. The great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will certainly fly over the land of the Soviet Union.

The crew members highly praised our students in Europe, saying they are truly Chairman Mao's good students and the good children of the Chinese people, and expressed their determination to learn from their unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

    光华轮船员集会愤怒声讨苏修血腥罪行
    苏联人民要造反　苏修集团命不长
    新华社三十一日讯　光华轮消息：赴印度尼西亚接运华侨的光华轮的船员和随船接侨工作人员，一月二十八日在船上举行集会，愤怒声讨苏修混蛋血腥镇压中国留欧学生的法西斯暴行。
    处于国际阶级斗争前线的光华轮船员和随船接侨工作人员，听到苏修混蛋血腥镇压我留欧学生的消息后，个个义愤填膺。在声讨大会上，船员们和随船接侨工作人员纷纷发言，一致表示最坚决地拥护我国外交部最最强烈抗议苏联政府血腥镇压我留欧学生的声明。船员们严正警告苏修混蛋们：镇压革命学生的人决不会有好下场。毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”你们这些修正主义混蛋们的狗命不长了，苏联革命人民一定会起来造你们的反，你们的命运将同沙皇、赫鲁晓夫一样，滚进历史的垃圾堆。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗一定会飘扬在苏联的国土上。
    船员们高度赞扬我留欧学生不愧为毛主席的好学生，中国人民的好儿女，表示要学习他们无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的高贵品质。
