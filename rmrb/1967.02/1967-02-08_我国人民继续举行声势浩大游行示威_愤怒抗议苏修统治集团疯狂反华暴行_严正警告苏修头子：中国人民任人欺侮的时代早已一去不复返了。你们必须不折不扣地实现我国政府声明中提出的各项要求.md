The savage atrocity committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership on February 3, an unprecedented event in the history of international diplomacy, has aroused the extreme indignation of the revolutionary people of our country. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary people in various places continue to hold massive rallies and demonstrations, voicing their protests. People have pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has violated the most basic diplomatic norms, blatantly infringed upon China's sovereignty, and brazenly attacked the Chinese embassy, assaulting Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff. They have committed acts that only fascist Germany and American imperialism could perpetrate, which is a great insult to the Chinese people. People ask: What exactly do the Soviet revisionist leaders intend to do by acting so viciously and ruthlessly? Where do they want to lead Sino-Soviet relations? Can a country that cannot even guarantee the legitimate activities and necessary safety of a foreign representative office still be considered a country? Can the Soviet government still be considered a government?

Revolutionary people in various places have pointed out that Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have been continuously and systematically manufacturing anti-China incidents, worsening relations between the two countries. This is a serious issue that the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world are closely watching. We must warn the Soviet revisionist leaders: The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. You can bring out whatever tricks you have!

The proletarian revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses in the capital have reached a new high in their protests and demonstrations against the Soviet revisionist leadership's mad provocations against the 700 million Chinese people. The demonstrators surged like a tide towards the gates of the Soviet Embassy in China. Revolutionary mass loudspeakers here read out countless protest letters, angrily denouncing the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionists. More than a hundred farmers from the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune revolutionary rebels came to the gates of the Soviet Embassy to protest and demonstrate. They pointed out: The Soviet leaders are so audacious, blatantly infringing upon China's sovereignty, violating the most basic diplomatic norms, and destroying the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. We Chinese revolutionary farmers will not stand for it. The Soviet government must fully implement all the demands put forward in our country's statement. A contingent of young revolutionaries who marched over 4,000 miles from Shaanxi Province to the capital warned the Soviet revisionist leadership at the gates of the Soviet embassy: The Chinese people will not tolerate the bullying of the Soviet revisionist group. You must act in accordance with our country's statement.

In recent days, the waves of anger have surged along the banks of the Huangpu River in Shanghai. Many main streets are plastered with large banners reading "Down with the counter-revolutionary Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Firmly support our country's statement!" and so on. People have taken to the streets in large numbers, holding powerful protest demonstrations. Many Red Guards have re-learned Chairman Mao's teaching that "All reactionaries are paper tigers" and are determined to fight revisionism to the end. They emphasized: All anti-China "heroes" will ultimately find themselves surrounded by the people of the world. The more the Soviet revisionist group fights against China, the faster and more miserable their failure will be. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary peasants in Shanghai emphasized that the Soviet revisionist group deliberately planned such savage acts against the diplomatic personnel of a socialist country, which only imperialist and fascist countries could do. They have completely misjudged the situation. Today, the 700 million Chinese people have stood up, and our restraint has its limits. The revolutionary masses in Tianma Commune and other areas in Songjiang County have sternly warned the Soviet revisionists: The era of the Chinese people being bullied by others is long gone. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with.

The Revolutionary Rebel Committee of Qingdao firmly supports our country's solemn statement and strongly protests the new fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Revolutionary Rebel Committee issued a protest letter, emphasizing that the Soviet revisionist leadership's blatant assault on our diplomatic personnel and journalists is a mad provocation against the great 700 million Chinese people. We must warn the Soviet revisionist leadership that we proletarian revolutionary rebels not only want to rebel against the handful of power-holders within our party who are taking the capitalist road and against all the ghosts and monsters in society, but also want to unite with the revolutionary people of the world to rebel against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries! The protest letter pointed out that the doomsday of the Soviet revisionist leadership is approaching!

In recent days, revolutionary masses in Hefei, Nanning, Kunming, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Jinan, Xining, Yinchuan, Chongqing, and other places have continuously held protest activities, denouncing the Soviet revisionist group's fascist atrocities against China, communism, and the people. Today, 50,000 people in Hefei held a rally and march in the cold wind. A representative of the Hefei Workers' Revolutionary Rebel United Committee said at the meeting that the Chinese working class absolutely cannot tolerate the Soviet revisionists' atrocities on February 3. We must be a hundred times more vigilant to defend our socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, which is on the front line of aiding Vietnam and fighting America, revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses have held rallies and marches. People pointed out that the Soviet revisionist group, as a running dog of American imperialism, will not have a good ending. The Soviet authorities must immediately apologize to the Chinese people. On the evening of the 6th, the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses of Kunming held a rally of 50,000 people and a demonstration march. Nearly 10,000 workers of the Lanzhou Railway System revolutionary rebels and many revolutionary teachers and students from major and secondary schools held a protest rally today. On the afternoon of the 7th, the revolutionary rebels of Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City held a rally and march in the rain. Revolutionary rebels in the legal system of Jiangxi Province emphasized that the Soviet revisionist thugs' rampage this time is extremely rare in the history of international relations and is a great insult to the dignity of the great 700 million Chinese people. The Soviet revisionist leaders will not last long if they do this. Revolutionary workers expressed that we must better respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," achieve new victories in revolution and production, and strike back at the savage provocations of the Soviet revisionist leaders with practical actions.

All passengers on the 15th special express train from Beijing to Guangzhou held a denunciation meeting en route on the 6th. Revolutionary workers, students, and cadres on this train spoke at the meeting, unanimously pointing out that the Soviet revisionists' mad provocations against the Chinese people can only arouse greater indignation among the Chinese people. You try to turn the wheel of history backward, but you will never succeed. You and all reactionaries are nothing but paper tigers with a strong exterior but a weak interior. One day, the Soviet people will rise up to overthrow you and rebel against you. The train is moving forward. The slogans "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Firmly support our country's solemn statement!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" roared out of the windows like thunder, echoing across the vast plains.

    严正警告苏修头子：中国人民任人欺侮的时代早已一去不复返了。你们必须不折不扣地实现我国政府声明中提出的各项要求
    据新华社七日讯　苏修领导集团二月三日制造的世界外交史上罕见的野蛮暴行，激起了我国广大革命人民极大的愤怒，各地革命造反派和革命人民继续举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，发出抗议的吼声。人们强调指出，苏联修正主义领导集团破坏最起码的外交关系准则，公然侵犯中国主权，肆无忌惮地袭击中国大使馆，殴打中国外交代表和工作人员，干出了只有法西斯德国和美帝国主义才干得出来的勾当，这是对中国人民的莫大侮辱。人们说：苏修头子们这样穷凶极恶、不择手段地干下去，你们究竟要想干什么？要把中苏两国关系引向何处？你们这个国家连一个外国代表机构的正当活动和必要的安全都不能保障，还究竟算不算是个国家？苏联政府还算不算是个政府？
    各地革命人民指出，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流连续地、有计划地疯狂制造反华事件，恶化两国关系，这是中国人民、苏联人民和全世界人民正在注视着的一个严重问题。我们要正告苏修头子们：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不是好惹的，你们还有什么本事可以统统使出来！
    首都无产阶级革命造反派和广大革命群众，抗议苏修领导集团向七亿中国人民进行疯狂挑衅的示威游行，今天达到新高潮。示威的群众象潮水般地涌向苏联驻中国大使馆门前。革命群众的广播车在这里宣读了无数封抗议信，愤怒声讨苏修叛徒的暴行。中阿友好人民公社革命造反派的农民一百多人赶到苏联大使馆门前，进行示威抗议。他们指出：苏修头头们胆大妄为，公然侵犯中国主权，破坏最起码的外交关系准则，破坏中苏两国人民的友谊，我们中国革命农民决不答应。苏联政府必须不折不扣地实现我国政府声明中提出的各项要求。步行了四千多里路，从陕西省来到首都的一支长征队的小将们，在苏联使馆门前警告苏修统治集团说：中国人民不能容忍苏修集团的欺负，你们必须老老实实按照我国政府的声明办事。
    在上海黄浦江畔，这几天怒潮澎湃。许多主要街道上，贴满了“打倒反革命苏修领导集团！”“坚决拥护我国政府声明！”等巨幅标语，人们纷纷走上街头，举行了强大的抗议示威游行。许多红卫兵小将重温了毛主席的“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”的教导，决心反修到底。他们强调指出：一切反华的“好汉”们，到头来都只能落在全世界人民的重重包围之中。苏修集团反华越是反得起劲，失败得也就越快越惨。上海的革命工人和革命农民强调指出，苏修集团蓄意策划对一个社会主义国家的外交人员采取这样野蛮的暴行，这只有帝国主义和法西斯国家才干得出来，他们完全错误地估计了形势，今天七亿中国人民已经站起来了，我们的克制是有限度的。松江县天马公社等地区广大贫下中农和农民造反派战士，严正警告苏修：中国人民任人欺侮的时代早已一去不复返了。中国人民决不是好惹的。
    青岛市革命造反委员会坚决拥护我国政府的严正声明，最最强烈抗议苏修统治集团新的法西斯暴行。革命造反委员会发表了抗议书，强调指出：苏联修正主义统治集团公然殴打我外交工作人员和记者，这是向伟大的七亿中国人民进行的疯狂挑衅。我们要正告苏修统治集团，我们无产阶级革命造反派，不但要造我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，要造社会上一切牛鬼蛇神的反，而且要团结全世界革命人民，大造同中国人民和世界人民为敌的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反！抗议书指出，苏修统治集团的末日就要来临了！
    合肥、南宁、昆明、兰州，南昌、济南、西宁、银川、重庆等地的革命群众，这几天连续举行抗议活动，人们痛斥苏修集团反华、反共、反人民的法西斯暴行。合肥今天有五万人冒着寒风举行集会和游行。合肥工人革命造反派联合委员会代表在会上指出，对于苏修二月三日的暴行，中国工人阶级是绝对不能容忍的。我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，保卫我们的社会主义制度，保卫无产阶级专政。地处援越抗美前线的广西南宁市，革命造反派和革命群众纷纷举行集会和游行。人们指出，苏修集团甘当美帝国主义的帮凶，是决不会有好下场的。苏修当局必须立即向中国人民低头认罪。昆明革命造反派和革命群众六日晚举行五万人大会和示威游行。兰州铁路系统革命造反派的职工和许多大中院校的革命师生等近万人今天举行了抗议集会。江西省、南昌市革命造反派七日下午冒雨集会游行。江西省政法界革命造反者强调指出，苏修暴徒这次行凶，是国际关系史上极其罕见的，是对我伟大七亿中国人民尊严的莫大侮辱。苏修头子们这样干，他们的日子是不会长久的。广大革命工人表示，我们一定要更好地响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，夺取革命、生产的新胜利，以实际行动痛击苏修头目们的野蛮挑衅。
    由北京开往广州的第十五次特别快车的全体旅客，六日在途中举行了声讨大会。乘坐这次列车的革命工人、学生、机关干部等代表在发言中一致指出：苏修对中国人民的疯狂挑衅，只能激起中国人民更大的愤慨。你们企图把历史车轮拉向后转，是永远也不会得逞的。你们和一切反动派一样，不过是外强中干的纸老虎。终有一天，苏联人民会起来革你们的命，造你们的反。列车在前进。“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“坚决拥护我国政府严正声明！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的口号声，象春雷一般冲出车窗，响彻在辽阔的原野上。
