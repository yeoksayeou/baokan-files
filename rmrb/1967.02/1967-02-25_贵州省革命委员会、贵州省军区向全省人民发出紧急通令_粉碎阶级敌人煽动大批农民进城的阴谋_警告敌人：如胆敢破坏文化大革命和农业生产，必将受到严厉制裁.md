The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Guizhou Military Region issued an emergency order on February 20, the full text of which is as follows:

The struggle for power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat has entered the decisive stage. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are in a completely isolated situation in the cities, where they are being denounced and attacked by everyone. However, these reactionaries are playing tricks and using deceit, spreading rumors and stirring up trouble in the countryside. They are colluding with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside, exploiting the peasants' deep affection for the Party, and inciting large numbers of peasants who do not understand the truth to enter the city to "rebel." They are instigating the peasants to turn against the revolutionary workers, students, and cadres, and to attack the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to protect themselves. This plot is extremely vicious. If their plot succeeds, it will not only directly sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but also seriously disrupt agricultural production. Currently, in a few counties such as Xishui, there is a serious situation where large numbers of peasants are rushing into the county seats. This is a new form of the counter-attack by the capitalist reactionary line. The new counter-attack by the class enemies must be thoroughly exposed! The new counter-attack by the class enemies must be resolutely smashed!

To this end, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Guizhou Military Region issue the following emergency order:

1. Seriously warn the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes in the countryside in various prefectures (states) and counties: Do not dare to incite the peasants to enter the city. If you dare to provoke, you will be severely punished by the Party's discipline and the law of the state!

2. The broad masses of revolutionary peasants must keep their eyes open and be vigilant, and must not be deceived by the class enemies. Peasants who have already entered the city should immediately return to their communes and production teams and actively engage in spring plowing production.

3. In places where peasants have entered the city, the military departments should spare no effort, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, to mobilize the peasants to quickly return to their communes and production teams. At the same time, organize the militia to protect important departments such as granaries.

4. Revolutionary peasants must fight to protect and consolidate the socialist collective economy, resolutely oppose the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic line, strictly prohibit the division of seeds, public accumulation funds, and reserve grain, and strictly prohibit the slaughter of draft animals and the felling of forests, etc.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants in various places should supervise the communes to hold good three-level cadre meetings by February 28.

All the people of the province should mobilize, resolutely and thoroughly smash the new counter-attack by the capitalist reactionary line, and resolutely respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, seize the revolution, promote production, and do a good job in spring plowing production!

    贵州省革命委员会、贵州省军区向全省人民发出紧急通令
    粉碎阶级敌人煽动大批农民进城的阴谋
    警告敌人：如胆敢破坏文化大革命和农业生产，必将受到严厉制裁
    新华社贵阳二十四日电　贵州省革命委员会、中国人民解放军贵州省军区二月二十日发出紧急通令，全文如下：
    无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争进入了大决战阶段。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在城里已处于老鼠过街，人人喊打的完全孤立的局面。但是，这些反动家伙耍阴谋，施诡计，到农村煽阴风，点邪火。他们勾结农村的地、富、反、坏分子，利用农民对党的深厚感情，煽动大批不明真相的农民，进城“造反”。他们挑拨农民与革命工人、学生、干部的关系，煽动农民围攻无产阶级革命派，来为自己保驾。这个阴谋极其恶毒。如果他们的阴谋得逞，不仅直接破坏无产阶级文化大革命，而且严重破坏农业生产。目前在习水等少数县发生大批农民涌进县城的严重情况，就是资产阶级反动路线新反扑的新形式。对于他们的这个大阴谋，必须加以揭穿！阶级敌人的罪恶的新反扑，必须坚决粉碎！
    为此，贵州省革命委员会、中国人民解放军贵州省军区发出紧急通令：
    一、严重警告各专区（州）、县的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和农村的牛鬼蛇神：不准你们煽动农民进城，如果胆敢挑衅，要受党纪国法的严厉制裁！
    二、广大的革命农民群众，要擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，绝不要上阶级敌人的当。已进城的农民群众，立即返回社、队，积极投入备耕生产。
    三、在发生农民进城的地方的武装部，应全力以赴，与无产阶级革命派一起，出面动员农民迅速回到社、队。同时，要组织民兵保护好粮仓等重要部门。
    四、革命农民要为保护和巩固社会主义集体经济而斗争，坚决反对反革命修正主义的经济主义，严禁分掉种子、公积金、储备粮，严禁宰杀耕牛、砍伐森林等。
    各地无产阶级革命派和贫下中农要监督公社，在二月二十八日以前开好三级干部会议。
    全省人民动员起来，坚决、彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决响应党中央、毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命，促生产，搞好春耕生产！
