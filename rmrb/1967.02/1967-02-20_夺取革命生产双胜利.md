The great leader Chairman Mao says: "We can learn things we did not previously understand. Not only are we good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world."

Under the personal care and support of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat have seized back the various powers usurped by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we revolutionary rebels have bravely taken on the responsibility of establishing a new revolutionary order and a new production order.

"Grasp revolution, promote production" is a policy that Chairman Mao has repeatedly emphasized. This policy is completely applicable, without exception, and must be strictly followed at all times in urban industrial and mining enterprises, in all scientific research institutions and design departments, and in the countryside.

The "Sixteen Points" point out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. Chairman Mao says: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the entire Chinese people." The broad masses of the people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will push the Cultural Revolution to a new stage and promote production to new heights.

The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Shanxi Province have united and, after seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the revolutionary masses, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, are firmly grasping the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy in their own hands. At this moment of seizing new victories, we, the broad revolutionary rebels, revolutionary workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres, must unite with all comrades who are willing to revolutionize and work together to improve production and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

"Grasp revolution, promote production" is the highest directive given to us by our great leader Chairman Mao. While grasping revolution, can we also do a good job in production? This is a struggle between two lines. The national economy is a whole, industrial production is a whole, and each link is connected to another. If any one department is disconnected, it may affect the overall situation. If industrial and agricultural production is interrupted even slightly, it will affect the smooth development of the revolution and will affect the economic life of the people. Therefore, under any circumstances, production must never be stopped, because doing so is contrary to Mao Zedong Thought and is against the Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat have seized power, which is only the first step of the revolution; what is more important is to consolidate and build the revolutionary order. Politically, we must grasp the reins of power in the hands of the revolutionary leftists, and with the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat as the core, unite the majority of the masses. Use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the revolutionary masses, and turn the mountains and rivers into iron and steel. Promoting production is an important aspect of consolidating power. Only by doing a good job in production can we make national defense more solid, prevent attacks by domestic and foreign class enemies, improve the lives of the people, and ensure that the Cultural Revolution advances along the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. At present, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, as they face imminent total collapse, have thrown out counter-revolutionary economism. These scoundrels use the "sugar-coated bullets" of economic benefits to tempt some of the masses. They squander national wealth at will, arbitrarily increase wages and benefits, and issue various funds indiscriminately, inciting a group of workers and peasants to leave their production posts, causing some workers to stop work and some peasants to flow into the cities to stop spring plowing and production preparations, in an attempt to disrupt production, disrupt the socialist economy, and ultimately achieve their counter-revolutionary political goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are still reorganizing their reactionary forces, gathering together landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and rounding up social dregs. In industrial and mining enterprises and the countryside, they are causing trouble and sabotage, attempting to seize power back from the revolutionary forces of the proletariat. They deceive some people into being passive and slacking off, and opposing the revolutionary rebels. These reactionary elements think they have succeeded, but in fact, they are the most stupid. We revolutionary rebels are not only the most decisive in revolution but also the most concerned about production. We fearlessly take on the double burden of revolution and production, and one by one, we repel and smash the sabotage of economism.

Many facts in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution prove that wherever the cultural revolution is well carried out, production has developed significantly. "Grasp revolution, promote production" ensures that the production system operates normally, establishes a good production leadership team, executes tasks, and organizes revolutionary masses to supervise the business team, making production work very well. Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "We must be thrifty and make revolution." All true revolutionary rebels of the proletariat must resolutely, seriously, and consciously execute this instruction. We believe that revolutionary workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students have a high sense of responsibility for the great socialist motherland and will definitely put "public" first, proceed from the overall interests of the state, and seize double victories in cultural revolution and production.

All revolutionary comrades, let us most correctly, most resolutely, most loyally, and most enthusiastically execute the brilliant directive of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." Victory will forever belong to the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat.

All revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, unite!
Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    夺取革命生产双胜利
    山西革命造反总指挥部　杨成效
    毛主席说：“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”
    无产阶级革命造反派，在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和支持下，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派窃取的种种大权夺回来了。我们革命造反派遵照毛主席的教导，勇敢地挑起了建立新的革命秩序，建立新的生产秩序的重担。
      “抓革命，促生产”，这是毛主席提出的方针，一再强调的方针。这个方针，不论在城市工矿企业、事业单位里面，在一切科学研究机构和设计部门里面，在农村里面，都是完全适用的，没有例外，必须坚决遵守，时刻遵守的。十六条中指出：无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。毛主席说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”广大人民群众用毛泽东思想武装起来，就会把文化大革命推向一个新阶段，把生产促向一个新高潮。
    我们山西省的无产阶级革命造反派联合起来，在夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，革命群众在以毛主席为首的党中央的英明领导下，正在把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。我们广大的革命造反派，革命工人、农民、革命干部在夺取新胜利的时刻，要团结一切愿意革命的同志，把生产搞得更好，赢得革命生产的双胜利。
      “抓革命，促生产”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席给我们的最高指示。在抓革命的同时，能不能搞好生产也是两条路线的斗争。国民经济是一个整体，工业生产是一个整体，一个环节扣一个环节，只要某一个部门脱节，就可能影响全局。工农业生产稍有间断，就会影响革命的顺利发展，就会影响到人民的经济生活。因而不论在任何情况下，都绝对不能停止生产，因为这样做是违背毛泽东思想的，是和文化大革命唱反调的。
    无产阶级革命造反派夺了权，只是完成了革命的第一步；更重要的是巩固和建设革命秩序。在政治上我们要把印把子掌握在革命左派手中，并且以无产阶级革命造反派为核心，把群众的大多数团结起来。用毛泽东思想统一革命群众的思想，把江山变成铁打的，钢铸的。而促生产是巩固政权的一个重要方面。只有把生产搞好，才能使国防更巩固，防止国内外阶级敌人的进攻，才能改善人民生活，才能使文化大革命沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。当前一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在他们面临全面彻底崩溃之时，抛出了反革命经济主义，这些家伙，利用经济福利的“糖衣炮弹”来诱惑一部分群众。他们任意挥霍国家财富，随意增加工资福利，滥发各种经费，唆使一批工人和农民离开生产岗位，造成一部分工人停工，一些农民流入城市停止春耕生产准备，妄图以此来破坏生产，破坏社会主义经济，进而达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的反革命政治目的。这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，还在重新组织他们的反动队伍，聚集地、富、反、坏、右分子，搜罗社会渣滓；在工矿企业及农村中，进行捣乱破坏，向无产阶级革命派进行反夺权。欺骗一部分人消极怠工，与革命造反派对抗。这一小撮反动分子自以为得计，其实是最愚蠢的。我们革命造反派不但革命最坚决，也最关心生产，我们无所畏惧地挑起革命和生产两副重担，一个接一个地打退和粉碎经济主义的破坏。
    无产阶级文化大革命中出现的许多事实证明，凡是文化革命搞得好的地方，生产就有了很大的发展。“抓革命，促生产”，使生产系统照常工作，建立好领导生产的班子，执行任务，并组织革命群众对业务班子实行监督，使生产工作搞得很好。我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“要节约闹革命”。一切真正的无产阶级革命派都应当坚决地、认真地、自觉地执行这一指示。我们相信革命的工人、农民、革命干部和革命学生对伟大的社会主义祖国有高度的责任感，一定能“公”字当头，从国家的整体利益出发，夺取文化革命和生产的双胜利。
    全体革命的同志们，让我们最正确、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱地执行我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的这一英明指示。胜利永远属于无产阶级革命造反派。
    一切无产阶级革命造反派联合起来！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
