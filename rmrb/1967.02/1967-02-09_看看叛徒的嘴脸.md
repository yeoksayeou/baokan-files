Title: The Face of the Traitor

The Soviet revisionist leading clique is a negative example for the revolutionary people of the whole world.

Several recent events have given us a new lesson.

In Moscow, they resorted to violence, suppressing Chinese students and attacking the Chinese Embassy, committing a rare fascist atrocity in the history of international diplomacy.

In Washington, they fawned and flattered, signing a so-called "peaceful use of outer space treaty" with American imperialism, and then reached a fisheries agreement that sells out the interests of the Soviet people.

In London, they followed the lead, collaborating with British Prime Minister Wilson to peddle the American imperialist deception of peace talks.

These are different events occurring in different places. But they all point to one common fact: The Soviet revisionist leading clique is a great traitor to the revolutionary people, a slave and lackey kneeling before imperialism.

Their frenzied anti-China stance is aimed at further selling out and currying favor with American imperialism. Conversely, if they want to do big business with American imperialism, they will inevitably intensify their anti-China, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary actions. These are two sides of the same coin. Only by linking these two aspects together can people have a clearer understanding of the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionist leading clique.

Of course, this small clique of traitors in Moscow, despite being able to use the betrayal of Leninist principles and the suppression of revolutionary people as a gift to curry favor with American imperialism, cannot save their own lives. American imperialism is a paper tiger, and modern revisionism is also a paper tiger. A paper tiger plus a paper tiger is still a paper tiger.

Chairman Mao said: "The reactionaries are bound to fail, and we are bound to win. The reason is not that we are strong, but that the reactionaries represent reaction, while we represent progress." This is the law of class struggle. Whether in the past, present, or future, this is unchangeable.

    看看叛徒的嘴脸
    苏修领导集团是全世界革命人民的反面教员。
    目前发生的几件事情又给我们上了一堂新课。
    在莫斯科，他们大打出手，镇压中国留学生，袭击中国大使馆，干出了世界外交史上罕见的法西斯暴行。
    在华盛顿，他们曲意奉承，同美帝国主义签订所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”之后，又达成了一项出卖苏联人民利益的苏美渔业协定。
    在伦敦，他们移樽就教，同英国首相威尔逊合伙推销美帝国主义的和谈骗局。
    这是在不同地点发生的不同的事情。但它们都表明了一个共同点：苏修领导集团是革命人民的大叛徒，是跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙。
    他们疯狂反华，是为了进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义。反过来说，他们要同美帝国主义大做交易，就必然要变本加厉地反华、反人民、反革命。这是一件事情的两面。只有把这两方面联系起来观察问题，人们才能更清楚地认识苏修领导集团的反革命嘴脸。
    当然，莫斯科这一小撮叛徒尽管可以拿背叛列宁主义的原则和镇压革命人民来作投靠美帝国主义的献礼，但是日暮途穷的美帝国主义却并不能救他们的命。美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，现代修正主义也是一只纸老虎。纸老虎加上纸老虎还是纸老虎。
    毛主席说：“反动派总有一天要失败，我们总有一天要胜利。这原因不是别的，就在于反动派代表反动，而我们代表进步。”这是阶级斗争规律。无论过去、现在和将来，都是不可改变的。
