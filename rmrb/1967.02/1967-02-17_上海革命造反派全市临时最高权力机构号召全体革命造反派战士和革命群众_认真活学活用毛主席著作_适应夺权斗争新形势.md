The Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' City-Wide Provisional Supreme Power Organ calls on all revolutionary rebel fighters and revolutionary masses to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works to adapt to the new situation in the struggle for power.

The Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' City-Wide Provisional Supreme Power Organ issued a decision on February 14, 1967, titled "On Advancing the Mass Movement of Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works to a New Stage in the Struggle for Power." The decision calls on all revolutionary rebel fighters and revolutionary masses to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage in the struggle for power, and to complete the glorious and arduous historical task assigned by our great leader Chairman Mao, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The decision states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, marked by the great "January Revolution" and the establishment of the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' City-Wide Provisional Supreme Power Organ, has entered a new historical period: the proletarian revolutionary forces have united and launched a comprehensive struggle for power from the bottom up. However, the enemy will not perish of its own accord; they will make their last desperate struggles. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line are using the weaknesses in the revolutionary rebel forces, such as the existence of small-groupism, anarchism, and individualism, to find their agents among the revolutionary rebels, to create divisions, and to sabotage the proletarian revolutionary forces' struggle for power. They are attempting to destroy the revolutionary rebel forces and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fail at the crucial moment of decisive victory.

The decision points out that to adapt to this new situation, the revolutionary rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly purge all bourgeois ideologies within the revolutionary ranks, and build a highly proletarianized, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready revolutionary force.

The Red Rebels of Heilongjiang have created valuable experiences in emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought and politics in the struggle for power, serving as an excellent example for the proletarian revolutionary forces in the struggle for power nationwide, and setting a brilliant example for the struggle for power.

Therefore, the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' City-Wide Provisional Supreme Power Organ decides that all revolutionary rebel fighters and revolutionary masses must further strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and "Carrying the Revolution Through to the End." The "Basic Experiences of the Power Struggle of the Red Rebels of Heilongjiang Province" and the February 10 editorial in the People's Daily, "An Excellent Example of the Power Struggle of the Proletarian Revolutionary Forces," are two very important revolutionary documents that should be studied simultaneously. In the study, the following points should be especially noted:

1. The establishment of the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' City-Wide Provisional Supreme Power Organ is only the continuation of the struggle for power under new conditions, not the end of the struggle for power. Therefore, after the establishment of the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' City-Wide Provisional Supreme Power Organ, the revolutionary rebels must intensify the comprehensive struggle for power from the bottom up and must not relax or be complacent in the slightest. They must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

2. In the struggle for power, the proletarian revolutionary forces must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and carry out "three-in-one combination, united struggle for power." Currently, the prevailing notions of "arrest any cadre" and "beat any person in power" are all fallacies. These arguments actually oppose everything indiscriminately, exclude everything, and overthrow everything, and are typical manifestations of the "left" in form but right in essence reactionary trend. We revolutionary rebels must seriously study Chairman Mao's works and establish Chairman Mao's class analysis viewpoint. In the movement, for those who adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line and revolutionary cadres, we should support them without reservation, trust them, and unite with them to struggle for power; for those who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party, anti-socialism, and not adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the person," and adopt the policy of "unity-criticism-unity" to help them correct their mistakes and quickly return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; for those who are capitalist-roaders in power and stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, we must resolutely criticize and thoroughly overthrow them, making sure they never rise again.

3. The various non-proletarian thoughts existing within the revolutionary rebels, such as small-groupism, anarchism, localism, sectarianism, guildism, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, factionalism, and individualism, must all be eliminated! The proletarian revolutionary forces must firmly arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, fight against the "self" and establish the "public," and organize a vast red revolutionary army with high revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, and seize all power from the hands of those who are capitalist-roaders in power!

4. Resolutely strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The struggle for power and the struggle against the counter-revolutionary seizure of power is a life-and-death class struggle. In this decisive battle, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the ghosts and monsters in society are colluding with each other to launch various forms of frenzied counterattacks against the revolutionary rebels. To this end, the revolutionary rebels must heighten their class vigilance, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    上海革命造反派全市临时最高权力机构号召全体革命造反派战士和革命群众
    认真活学活用毛主席著作　适应夺权斗争新形势
    要求革命造反派必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底肃清革命队伍中的一切资产阶级思潮，建立起一支非常无产阶级化、非常革命化、非常战斗化的队伍。
    新华社上海十六日电　上海革命造反派全市临时最高权力机构二月十四日作出“关于在夺权斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的决定”，号召全体革命造反派战士和广大革命群众在夺权斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段，胜利地完成我们伟大领袖毛主席所赋予我们的光荣而艰巨的历史任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    决定说，上海的无产阶级文化大革命，以伟大的“一月革命”和上海革命造反派全市临时最高权力机构的成立为标志，进入了一个崭新的历史时期：无产阶级革命派联合起来，全面展开自下而上的夺权斗争。但是，敌人是不会自行消灭的，他们还要作最后的垂死挣扎。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，正在竭力利用革命造反派队伍内某些人存在着小团体主义、无政府主义、个人主义等资产阶级思想的弱点，千方百计地在革命造反派中寻找他们的代理人，制造分裂，破坏无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，妄图搞垮革命造反派的队伍，使无产阶级文化大革命在夺取决定性胜利的关键时刻中途夭折。
    决定指出，为了适应这种新的形势，革命造反派必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底肃清革命队伍中的一切资产阶级思潮，建立起一支非常无产阶级化、非常革命化、非常战斗化的革命队伍。
    黑龙江红色造反者创造了在夺权斗争中突出毛泽东思想、突出政治的宝贵经验，是无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的好范例，为全国革命造反派树立了一个光辉的夺权斗争的好榜样。
    为此，上海革命造反派全市临时最高权力机构决定，全体革命造反派战士和广大革命群众必须进一步加强学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作。《黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验》和二月十日《人民日报》社论《无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的一个好范例》，是两篇非常重要的革命文件，应该同时进行学习。在学习中，希望特别注意下列几点：
    一、上海革命造反派全市临时最高权力机构的成立，只是夺权斗争在新条件下的继续，而决不是夺权斗争的结束。因此，在上海革命造反派全市临时最高权力机构成立后，革命造反派必须加紧进行全面的自下而上的夺权斗争，决不能有一丝一毫的松懈麻痹，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    二、无产阶级革命派在进行夺权斗争中，必须坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，实行“三位一体，联合夺权”。目前流行的“见干部就揪，是当权派就打”、“凡是干部都不可信”等说法，统统都是谬论。这些论调实际上是不分青红皂白地反对一切、排斥一切、打倒一切，是形“左”实右反动思潮的典型表现。我们革命造反派一定要认真学习毛主席著作，树立毛主席的阶级分析观点。在运动中，对于那些坚持无产阶级革命路线的当权派和革命干部，我们应该毫无保留地支持他们、信任他们，和他们联合进行夺权斗争；对于那些犯有错误但不是反党反社会主义、不是坚持资产阶级反动路线的干部，就应该按照毛主席的教导，“惩前毖后、治病救人”，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方针，帮助他们改正错误，尽快地回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来；对于那些走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，就必须坚决批判，彻底打倒，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    三、当前革命造反派内部存在着的各种非无产阶级思想，如小团体主义、无政府主义、本位主义、宗派主义、行会主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、山头主义、个人主义等，统统都让它滚蛋吧！无产阶级革命派必须坚定不移地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，组织起一支具有高度革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的浩浩荡荡的红色造反大军，把一切走资本主义道路当权派手中的权统统都夺过来！
    四、坚决加强无产阶级专政。夺权与反夺权的斗争，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。在这场决定性的战斗中，一小撮反革命修正主义分子和社会上的牛鬼蛇神互相勾结在一起，对革命造反派进行各种形式的猖狂反扑。对此，革命造反派必须提高阶级警惕，大力加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压一切破坏无产阶级文化大革命的现行反革命分子，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。（附图片）
