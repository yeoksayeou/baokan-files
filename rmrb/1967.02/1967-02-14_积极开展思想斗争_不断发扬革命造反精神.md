The revolutionary rebels of our factory, after a long and arduous struggle, on January 19th, comprehensively seized the power from the capitalists who were taking the capitalist road. All the powers of the factory, including political, economic, production management, and technical management, have been seized by the revolutionary rebels. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." We revolutionary rebels understand: the victory of seizing power is only the first step in the long march of ten thousand miles. The class enemies are still using various forms to launch a fierce counterattack. To truly grasp the power firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses and establish a new revolutionary order, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Grasp revolution, promote production," and carry both the burdens of revolution and production. Our revolutionary forces must be a strong and united fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "As long as our Communist Party's ranks are in order and our steps are in unison, our soldiers are elite, and our weapons are good, then any powerful enemy can be defeated by us."

We deeply feel that under the "white terror" of the bourgeoisie, it is not easy to be a true revolutionary. After we have taken power, it is even more difficult to be a true revolutionary. After the victory of seizing power, the status of the revolutionary rebels has changed, from a minority to a majority, from powerless to powerful. This puts our revolutionary rebels in a new test. Many of our comrades, when suffering from the oppression and attacks of the capitalists who were taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, showed the firmness of proletarian revolutionaries. At that time, the target of the struggle was clear, everyone only thought about how to rise up, without time to think about other things. With the deepening of the revolutionary struggle, especially after rising up and taking power, new contradictions have emerged. Some comrades' non-proletarian thoughts in their minds have surfaced, and some wrong tendencies have begun to grow. For example, some comrades have serious tendencies of extreme democratization, doing whatever they want, with no concept of collective or unity in their minds. If something is not to their liking, they shout "undemocratic."

Some comrades have developed a sense of complacency and self-satisfaction. They always think they are the most revolutionary, that no one is as good as them, and consider themselves "old revolutionaries," believing that "only old rebels are worthwhile." They always feel that others are not as revolutionary as they are. "Not planting peach trees, only wanting to pick peaches," such people should "step aside."

Some comrades also fight for power and personal gain, disregarding the collective. For a small matter at the tip of the nose, they cause a "heaven-shaking" uproar, and at the slightest provocation, they want to pull out some people to start another faction.

There are also a few comrades who do not rebel for the revolution, but for personal gain. They rebel to show off to others, and if they succeed, they can become a "big leftist."

These various wrong thoughts and tendencies are ultimately caused by the "self" character. If they are not overcome in time and allowed to develop, they will cause our forces to become disunited, the organization to become lax, to lose touch with the masses, and to lose our fighting power, deviating from the revolutionary direction.

It is not surprising that such wrong thoughts and tendencies arise within our revolutionary camp. Because the members of our revolutionary rebels come from the old society, and although some grew up in the new society, their bourgeois thoughts and worldviews have not been fundamentally transformed. The current sharp struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected within our revolutionary forces. Chairman Mao teaches us: contradictions and struggles are ubiquitous. Without contradictions and struggles, things cannot develop or progress. For every revolutionary rebel and every revolutionary rebel organization, this is no exception. Our revolutionary rebels have grown and become stronger in the process of continuously fighting against external enemies and continuously fighting against various wrong thoughts and tendencies within our own ranks. At this new stage of the revolution, at this new turning point, whether the revolutionary rebels can continue to stand at the forefront of the movement and lead the masses to charge forward is an important factor in whether you can correctly and timely solve the new contradictions in your thoughts or within the revolutionary ranks according to the requirements of the objective situation.

Our experience is: to keep our forces always full of fighting spirit and thorough revolutionary spirit, we must continuously carry out criticism and self-criticism within the ranks, carry out active ideological struggles, and rebel against ourselves. Not only do we rebel against ourselves, but we also rebel against each other. Just as Chairman Mao often teaches us: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon to achieve unity within the party and revolutionary organizations and make them effective in battle." We revolutionary rebels must remember this teaching.

Within our revolutionary rebel organization, regardless of who it is, whether it is a staff member of the Rebel Headquarters or a general member, they are all equal revolutionary comrades. Regardless of whether they are "leaders" or not, if they have opinions, they should be brought out frankly and directly. If there are different opinions, a debate should be held, sometimes arguing until faces are red and ears are hot, until the problem is solved. Our principle is: whoever's opinion is correct, whoever's opinion is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we follow and act according to that person. Once, the staff members of the Rebel Headquarters determined a major activity plan, and some members disagreed, so they ran to the headquarters and debated with them, finally helping the headquarters staff members realize that the decision was wrong. In the debates within our rebel ranks about different opinions, no one cares about your attitude or my words. If your opinion is wrong, think about it, if someone else's words are right, you change your mind. Sometimes it takes a while to understand, but after understanding, it feels especially refreshing. We believe that only by exposing contradictions can we solve them. We oppose that bourgeois evil practice of being "gentle, respectful, frugal, and yielding" on the surface but "cunning and vicious" at heart. The result of our continuous rebellion within the ranks is that problems are solved in a timely manner, and everyone feels comfortable. When seeing things that are not beneficial to the revolution or the collective, everyone dares to speak out. In our minds, there are private thoughts, but because of this atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism, mutual rebellion, sometimes private thoughts just appear and are beaten back by the masses, not standing a chance.

Within the rebel ranks, we often actively help the comrades elected by everyone to correct their shortcomings and improve their work, truly establishing proletarian authority. The work of the headquarters comrades is completely open to everyone to discuss, to rebel. The headquarters comrades also reasonably arrange their work, participate in labor, go deep into reality, and maintain close ties with the masses. Because we understand: "power" is given by the masses. If the mass base is lost and there is no mass support, such seizure of power can only be formal. If the revolutionary organization and its leaders deviate from the masses, they will ultimately go to the opposite side.

Some of our revolutionary rebel comrades may sometimes have this or that shortcoming or mistake, or even temporarily lose their way and fall down. Regarding these problems, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings and adopt the attitude of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the illness to save the person." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our purpose in exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings is, just like a doctor treating a disease, completely to save the person, not to kill the person." Only by adhering to this traditional policy established by Chairman Mao can we correctly solve various problems within our ranks. To truly grasp this policy, we must overcome subjectivism and metaphysics in our minds. Do not see someone's mistake and strike them down with one blow. Allow people to make mistakes, allow people to correct mistakes, and allow people to have a process of recognition. Do not act only from personal feelings, but from the party's cause. Under the premise of a unified direction, seek common ground while reserving differences, unite the majority, so that our forces can develop and grow, and our cause can prosper.

We feel: within the revolutionary rebel ranks, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought to rebel against ourselves, this is too important. Our forces, in the most difficult times, relied on this to unite ourselves and defeat the enemy; today, when we have grasped revolutionary power, we must rely on this to unite the masses and consolidate and develop the victory of the cultural revolution. We believe: as long as we grasp this, our revolutionary forces will never collapse, and we will be invincible.

    积极开展思想斗争　不断发扬革命造反精神
    北京第二机床厂革命造反总部　兴　无
    我们厂的革命造反派，经过长期、艰苦的斗争，今年一月十九日，全面夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权，全厂的政治、经济、生产管理和技术管理等等大权，统统夺到了革命造反派手里。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    毛主席说：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们革命造反派懂得：夺权的胜利，只是万里长征走完了第一步，阶级敌人还在利用各种形式进行猖狂反扑，要真正把权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，建立起革命的新秩序；要按照毛主席的指示：“抓革命，促生产”，把革命和生产两副重担一起挑起来。我们的革命队伍就必须是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的坚强的战斗集体。毛主席教导我们：“只要我们共产党的队伍是整齐的，步调是一致的，兵是精兵，武器是好武器，那末，任何强大的敌人都是能被我们打倒的。”
    我们深深感到，在资产阶级的“白色恐怖”下面，做个真正的革命派不容易；在我们自己掌了权以后，做个真正的革命派更不容易。夺权胜利以后，革命造反派本身的地位随之发生了变化，由少数变成了多数，由无权变成了有权。这就使我们革命造反派面临着一场新的考验。我们许多同志，在遭受走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子压迫、打击并和他们作斗争的时候，表现了无产阶级革命战士的坚定性。那时候，斗争的目标集中，大家只想着怎么翻身，没有工夫想别的。随着革命斗争的深入发展，特别是翻了身、掌了权以后，新的矛盾就突出起来了，一些同志头脑中的非无产阶级思想就冒了出来，一些错误倾向也开始滋长。譬如：有些同志极端民主化的思想很严重，自己想怎么干就怎么干，头脑里根本没有集体，没有集中，稍不如意就叫喊“不民主”。
    有的同志滋长了骄傲自满情绪。总以为自己是最革命的，谁也不如我，以“老革命”自居，认为“老造反派才够意思”。总感到别人革命不如我早。“不栽桃树，只想摘桃”，这种人应该“靠边站”。
    还有的同志争权夺利，不顾集体。为了鼻子尖底下一点事，也闹个“天翻地覆”，动不动就要拉出去一些人另搞一摊，另立山头。
    也有极个别的同志，不是为革命而造反，而是为了追求个人的东西，造反是给别人看的，造好了就可以当个“大左派”。
    这些形形色色的错误思想倾向，归根到底都是一个“私”字在作怪。如果不及时克服，任其发展下去，就会使我们的队伍团结涣散，组织松懈，脱离群众，失去战斗力，迷失革命的大方向。
    在我们革命派内部，产生这样或那样的错误思想、错误倾向，并不奇怪。因为我们革命造反派的成员，有的来自旧社会，有的虽然生长在新社会，资产阶级思想、资产阶级世界观并没有得到根本改造，而当前无产阶级同资产阶级之间的尖锐斗争，必然要在我们革命队伍内部反映出来。毛主席教导我们：矛盾、斗争是无所不在的。没有矛盾、没有斗争，事物就不能发展、不能前进。对于每个革命造反战士、每个革命造反组织来说，也同样不例外。我们革命造反派，就是在不断同外部敌人作斗争，同时又不断同自己队伍内部的各种错误思想、错误倾向作斗争的过程中发展壮大起来的。在革命发展到新阶段，到达新的转折点的时候，革命造反派能不能继续站在运动的最前列，带领群众冲锋陷阵，很重要的一条，就是看你能不能根据客观形势的要求，及时地正确地解决自己思想上或革命队伍内部的新的矛盾。
    我们的体会是：要使自己的队伍永远保持旺盛的战斗力，和彻底的革命精神，必须不断地在内部开展批评与自我批评，开展积极的思想斗争，必须造自己的反，不仅自己造反，还要互相造反。正象毛主席经常教导我们的：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”我们革命造反派必须牢记这一教导。
    在我们的革命造反组织内部不管是什么人，是造反总部的勤务员，还是一般队员，都是平等的革命同志关系。不管什么“头头”不“头头”，只要有意见就提，就开门见山、直截了当地端出来。有不同意见，就展开争论，有时争得面红耳赤，一直争到解决问题为止。我们的原则是：谁的意见对，谁的意见符合毛泽东思想，就服从谁，就按谁的办。有一次造反总部勤务员确定了一次大的活动计划，有些队员不同意，就跑到总部和他们展开辩论，终于帮助总部勤务员认识到这个决定是错误的。在我们造反派内部这种不同意见的争论中，谁也不去计较你的态度怎么样，我的词句怎么样。自己的意见错了，琢磨琢磨，人家的话对，自己就改了。有时候一时想不通，但想通了以后，心里特别痛快。我们认为，只有暴露矛盾，才能解决矛盾。我们反对那种资产阶级的恶劣作风——表面上“温良恭俭让”，骨子里“阴险毒辣”。我们内部不断造反的结果，使问题解决得及时，人人心情舒畅。看到不利于革命、不利于集体的事，谁都敢提、敢说。在我们的头脑里，私心杂念也不是没有，但是，由于有了这种批评与自我批评的空气，互相造反的空气，有时私心杂念刚露头，就被群众打了回去，根本站不住脚。
    在造反派内部，我们对大家推选出来的勤务员也经常主动地帮助他们改正缺点，改进工作，真正树立无产阶级的权威。总部同志的工作，大家完全有权过问，有权造反。总部的同志自己也合理地安排工作，参加劳动，深入实际，密切联系群众。因为我们懂得：“权”是群众授予的，如果失去了群众基础，没有群众支持，这样的夺权只能是形式上的夺权，即使夺了也不能巩固。革命组织及其负责人，如果脱离了群众，最终就会走向自己的反面。
    我们革命造反派的一些同志，有时候也会产生这样那样的缺点错误，甚至可能一时迷失方向、跌了跟头。对待这些问题，我们根据毛主席的教导，采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度。毛主席教导我们：“我们揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好像医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死。”只有遵循毛主席制定的这个传统政策，才能正确解决我们队伍内部的各种问题。要能真正掌握这个政策，就必须克服我们头脑中主观主义和形而上学。不要看见别人有错误就一棍子打死。应该允许人家犯错误，允许人家改正错误，并允许人家有一个认识过程。不要只从个人感情出发，而是应该从党的事业出发，在大方向一致的前提下，求同存异，团结大多数，这样，我们的队伍才能发展壮大，我们的事业才会兴旺起来。
    我们感到：在革命造反派内部开展批评与自我批评，用毛泽东思想造自己的反，这一条太重要了。我们的队伍在最困难的时候，靠了这一条团结自己，战胜敌人；在掌握了革命大权的今天，更要靠这一条团结群众，巩固和发展文化革命的胜利。我们相信：掌握住这一条，我们的革命队伍就永远垮不了，就无往而不胜。
