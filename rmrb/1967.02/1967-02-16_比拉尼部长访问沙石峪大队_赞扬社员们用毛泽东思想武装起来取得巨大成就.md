Minister Bilani of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Planning, Bilani Mamadou Wani, today visited the Shashiya Brigade of the Yugezhuang People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province. He enthusiastically praised the achievements made by the brigade members who have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Minister Bilani told the brigade members, "You have achieved such great results because you have armed yourselves with the powerful ideological weapon—Mao Zedong Thought. I have fully seen that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the great courage to overcome difficulties." He wished the brigade members to persist in studying Chairman Mao's works and to strive for new victories.

Minister Bilani and the members of the Mauritanian government delegation led by him arrived at the village of Shashiya by helicopter. The brigade's Cultural Revolution Committee, the Red Guards' leaders, and representatives of the brigade members welcomed them warmly, shaking hands with Minister Bilani and the others. The welcoming crowd held up portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums, and waved red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" while shouting, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania!" "Down with imperialism and old and new colonialism!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Minister Bilani, holding a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waved it frequently to greet the brigade members.

The Mauritanian guests visited the terraced fields that the brigade members had painstakingly cultivated on the rocky mountains, as well as the brigade's orchards and water reservoirs. They also visited the homes of the brigade members and had cordial conversations with them.
