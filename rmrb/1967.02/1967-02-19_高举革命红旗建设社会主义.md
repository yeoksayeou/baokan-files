During our visit to Albania, from the snow-covered northern region of Shkodër to the ever-springlike southern coast of Sarandë, we saw everywhere the heroic Albanian people hoisting the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, holding a gun in one hand and a pickaxe in the other, and effectively building socialism. Especially after the historic Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction have entered a new phase.

The Red Flag Flies High

The heroic Albanian people, on their forward march, have encountered the savage blockade and frenzied sabotage of imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique. However, the Albanian people have not been intimidated. Comrade Enver Hoxha solemnly declared: "We would rather die standing than live on our knees." With great heroism, they have smashed all the tricks and plots of the enemy, advancing the socialist revolution and socialist construction to victory.

We visited the port of Durrës, Albania's most important sea gateway and a frontline stronghold in the Albanian people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. The port director, Comrade Farus, enthusiastically led us on a tour of the port. He angrily recounted to us the following incident: In 1961, the Khrushchev revisionist clique broke off diplomatic relations with Albania in bad faith, unilaterally tearing up all the contracts they had signed. At that time, a Soviet ship carrying construction materials according to the contract was docked at the port of Durrës, ready to unload its cargo. The Soviet revisionist leadership ordered the ship to return immediately. The Albanian comrades lodged a strong protest, but the Soviet captain merely shrugged his shoulders and took the construction materials away as planned.

The heroic Albanian people have smashed the various tricks and provocations of imperialism and modern revisionism. They have built Durrës into an even more magnificent and beautiful city. The port workers, inspired by the call of the Party of Labour of Albania, have put forward active initiatives, determined to repair ten-thousand-ton freighters with simple equipment that were originally to be sent abroad for repair. They have also manufactured their own cranes and other equipment. They said: "Every achievement in our construction is a heavy blow to imperialism and revisionism, and every product we make is a bullet fired at the enemy!"

During our visit to the Elbasan oil refinery, we saw the oil refining equipment built by the Albanian workers with their own hands. To achieve self-sufficiency in fuel, the Albanian people began building this refinery in 1956 and expanded it in 1961. The workers said, "We must respond to the Party's call, resolutely smash the sabotage plots of the modern revisionists, and complete the task of expanding the refinery." The director of the refinery, Comrade Mihal, told us the following story: During the expansion of the refinery, a furnace needed to be built. The Soviet technicians, citing the lack of construction machinery, said it couldn't be built, and fled to a hotel in Tirana. A week later, when he returned, the workers had already built the furnace. At this point, Director Mihal smiled and said: "People are the decisive factor. As long as there are people with a high level of socialist consciousness, they can overcome imperialism and revisionism and overcome any difficulty."

Dare to Change the Heavens and Earth

The Albanian people, armed with revolutionary spirit, dare to think and act boldly in socialist construction, strive hard, and constantly change the face of their country, creating miracles never seen before in Albanian history. They farm for the revolution, turning vast marshes into fertile "granaries." Mountain farmers, with revolutionary heroism, build terraces on steep slopes, wrestle land from the rocks, and achieve grain self-sufficiency. In the deep mountains of the northern part of Shkodër, the Uris Agricultural Cooperative is a shining banner and Albania's Dazhai.

Uris is nestled in towering mountains, surrounded by cliffs and boulders, and even water has to be fetched from far away. Before liberation, the people here lived in extreme poverty, and the saying among the masses was: "Even chickens can only eat stones." After collectivization in 1957, the grain self-sufficiency rate gradually increased from three months to seven months. Last year, the members responded to the call of the Party of Labour of Albania and decided to open up the wasteland, build terraces, expand the cultivated area, increase the yield per unit area, and achieve grain self-sufficiency. The secretary of the cooperative branch, Comrade Mukya, introduced to us the moving scene of opening up the wasteland and building terraces. He said that the members summarized the experience of building terraces in the past, learned from the example of China's Dazhai, watched a documentary about Dazhai, and decided to grow grain among the rocks. Members armed with revolutionary spirit fought bravely with their own hands against the rocks. When they encountered large rocks, they smashed and moved them away; when the ground froze, they burned fires to melt it; when there was little soil on the rocky mountains, they carried soil from other places on their backs and by animals, and spread it on the rocks. This cooperative not only completely achieved grain self-sufficiency but also sold more than 3,000 piculs of surplus grain to the state. Comrade Mukya summed up the experience of these achievements as: closely relying on the Party's leadership and highly carrying forward the revolutionary spirit.

Firmly Walking the Socialist Road

The Albanian people insist on the socialist direction and resolutely walk the socialist road. A movement to develop collective economy and reduce the private plots of agricultural cooperative members is being fully carried out in the Albanian countryside. The initiative to reduce private plots was first put forward by the Stalin Cooperative in Rrushen District and the Enver Hoxha Cooperative in Fier District. After this initiative was put forward, it immediately received the support of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the response of the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members. One of the members who proposed this initiative, Comrade Muja, said: "Our happy life today is all given to us by the Party and the cooperative. We should do our best to develop the collective economy and promote the cooperative."

The broad cadres and revolutionary youth of Albania, in response to the Party's call, universally participate in unpaid voluntary labor. They regard this as an important lesson in promoting the revolutionization of thought and cultivating the communist spirit. We personally saw various levels of cadres going to the fields to help with autumn harvest and winter sowing, and the broad masses of young intellectuals actively going to the mountains to open up wasteland, plant trees, and build terraces.

Under the education of the Party, the Albanian people have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of public-mindedness, and heroes who are worthy of song and praise have emerged in all sectors. When we visited Durrës, people were enthusiastically praising the heroic deeds of Adam Reka, a crane operator who had once been a guerrilla fighter.

During our visit to the asbestos board factory in Fier, we also heard a moving heroic deed. There was a worker named Muçka in this factory. When he saw a transformer suddenly catch fire, he did not consider his own safety at all, and without hesitation, he rushed up to extinguish the fire, preventing a major fire in the factory.

The Albanian people are a heroic people. Albania is a great beacon of socialism in Europe, and this beacon is shining with ever-brighter light, illuminating the path forward for the European people.

    高举革命红旗建设社会主义
    我们在阿尔巴尼亚访问期间，从大雪覆盖的北部斯库台山区，到四季如春的南方萨兰达海边，到处看到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举马列主义的革命红旗，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，一手拿枪，一手拿镐，卓有成效地建设着社会主义。特别在具有重大历史意义的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会之后，阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设出现了一个崭新的局面。
    巍然屹立红旗飘飘
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在前进的道路上遭到以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的野蛮封锁和疯狂破坏。然而，阿尔巴尼亚人民并没有被吓倒。恩维尔·霍查同志庄严地宣布：我们宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生。他们以大无畏的英雄气概，粉碎了敌人的一切阴谋诡计，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设胜利地推向前进。
    我们访问的都拉斯海港，是阿尔巴尼亚最重要的海上门户，也是阿尔巴尼亚人民反帝反修斗争的前哨阵地。港务局长法鲁斯同志热情地带领我们参观了港口。他向我们愤慨地讲述了这样一件事：一九六一年，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团背信弃义，断绝了同阿尔巴尼亚的外交关系，片面撕毁了签订的一切合同。当时一艘按照合同运送建筑材料的苏联轮船，正停泊在都拉斯港口，准备卸货。苏联修正主义领导集团命令这条船立即返航。阿尔巴尼亚同志提出严重抗议，苏联船长只耸了耸肩膀，照样把建筑材料运走了。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义的种种阴谋挑衅，他们把都拉斯建设得更加雄伟美丽了。海港工人在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召鼓舞下，提出了积极的创议，决心以简单的设备，把原来要送到外国修理的万吨货轮，自己修理。他们还自己制造了起重机和其他设备。他们说：“我们的每项建设成就，都是对帝国主义和修正主义的沉重打击，我们的每件产品都是射向敌人的一颗子弹！”
    我们参观爱尔巴桑炼油厂时，看到阿尔巴尼亚工人以自己的双手建立起来的炼油设备。阿尔巴尼亚人民为了做到燃料自给，一九五六年开始建设这个炼油厂，一九六一年又进行了扩建。工人们说，我们一定要响应劳动党的号召，坚决粉碎现代修正主义者的破坏阴谋，完成扩建炼油厂的任务。炼油厂厂长米哈尔同志告诉我们这样一个故事：在扩建炼油厂时，要修建一个炼油炉，苏联技术人员借口说没有修建机械，修不起来，就溜到地拉那旅馆去了。一个星期后，当他回来时，工人们已经把炼油炉修建起来了。说到这里，米哈尔厂长微笑着说：人的因素第一，只要有了有高度社会主义觉悟的人，就能够战胜帝国主义和修正主义，就能战胜任何困难。
    敢教日月换新天
    以革命精神武装起来的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在社会主义建设中敢想敢干，艰苦创业，不断改变着自己国家的面貌，创造出了阿尔巴尼亚历史上从未有过的奇迹。他们为革命种田，使大片的沼泽地变成了富饶的“粮仓”。山区的农民以革命的英雄气概，大修梯田，向岩石争地，实现粮食自给。在斯库台区北部深山中的乌里斯农业合作社，是一面光辉旗帜，是阿尔巴尼亚的大寨。
    乌里斯座落在崇山峻岭中，四处是悬崖陡壁，乱石峥嵘，甚至喝的水也要到很远的地方去背。解放以前，这里的人民生活极端贫困，群众中间流行着这样的说法：“鸡也只能吃石头”。一九五七年合作化之后，粮食自给率逐渐从三个月增加到七个月。去年社员们响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召，决定大开荒山，大修梯田，扩大耕地面积，提高单位面积产量，实现粮食自给。农业合作社支部书记牟克亚同志向我们介绍了开荒山、修梯田的动人情景。他说，社员们总结了过去修梯田的经验，学习了中国大寨的榜样，看了关于大寨的纪录影片，决心要在岩石间种出粮食来。以革命精神武装起来的社员们，用自己的双手同岩石展开了英勇的搏斗。遇到大石头，就把它砸开搬走；地冻了，就烧火融化；石山上土少，就用人背和牲口驮，把土从别的地方运来，铺在石头上面。这个社现在不仅完全实现了粮食自给，而且还卖给国家三千多公担余粮。牟克亚同志把取得这些成就的经验归结为：紧紧依靠党的领导，高度发扬革命精神。
    坚决走社会主义道路
    阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持社会主义大方向，坚决走社会主义的道路。一个发展集体经济、缩小农业合作社社员自留地的运动正在阿尔巴尼亚农村全面展开。缩小自留地的倡议首先是由鲁什涅区的斯大林合作社和费里区的恩维尔·霍查合作社提出来的。这个倡议提出之后，立即得到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的支持和广大农业合作社社员的响应。提出这一倡议的成员之一穆亚同志说：“我们今天的幸福生活，都是党和合作社给我们的。我们应该尽一切努力发展集体经济，把合作社推向前进。”
    阿尔巴尼亚的广大干部和革命青年，响应党的号召，普遍参加不计报酬的义务劳动。他们把这看作是促进思想革命化、培养共产主义精神的重要一课。我们亲眼看到各级干部纷纷下田帮助农业社秋收冬种，广大知识青年积极上山开荒、植树、修梯田。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的教育下，发扬了一心为公的革命精神，各条战线上不断涌现出大批可歌可泣的英雄人物。我们在都拉斯访问时，人们正以激动和崇敬的心情传颂着曾经当过游击队员的起重机工人亚当·雷卡的英雄事迹。
    我们在访问发罗拉的石棉板厂时，也听到一件动人的英雄事迹。这个工厂有个名叫穆奇卡的工人，当他看到一个变压器突然起火时，根本不考虑自己生命的安危，毫不犹豫，立即冲上去将火扑灭，使工厂避免了一场火灾。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是英雄的人民。阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯，这盏明灯正放射出日益强烈的光芒，照亮着欧洲人民前进的道路。
