	Smash the "Private" Character, Establish the "Public" Character, and Achieve New Great Victories!
	An Open Letter from the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Committee to the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Organizations

	New China News Agency, Qingdao, February 20th - The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Committee issued an open letter titled "Smash the 'Private' Character, Rectify the Style, and Achieve New Great Victories!" to the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Organizations. The full text is as follows:

	"On January 22nd, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved great unity. With lightning speed, they seized the power of the party, government, finance, and culture from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. The storm of the 'January Revolution' ruthlessly destroyed all nests of revisionism. A mass, bottom-up struggle for power is now sweeping across the city. The broad masses of worker revolutionaries, since stepping onto the political stage, have shown immense power. They grasp revolution and promote production, turning spiritual strength into tremendous material strength, exceeding the total production value plan for January, and achieving a great victory, giving those capitalist bosses who said 'wait and see' a hard blow. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Laoshan County have also risen up. The revolutionary peasant movement is burning like wildfire. They are breaking free from all constraints and rushing forward on the path to liberation. 'Grasp revolution, promote production, and fire the first shot for spring plowing' is their battle cry. Revolutionary students, following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, are organizing and planning to go to factories and villages, combining with workers and peasants, and taking the necessary path of history, thus advancing another step on the road to revolutionization. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon the new Qingdao. The sound of victory is everywhere, and the revolutionary situation is thrilling and inspiring.

	However, the class enemy will not voluntarily retreat from the stage of history. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, seeing their paradise lost, hate the proletarian revolutionaries to the core. They secretly spread rumors and stir up trouble, using every trick to sabotage production, sabotage the national economy, and sabotage state property, attempting to frame the newly empowered proletarian revolutionaries and strangle the new power in its cradle. Their intentions are extremely malicious!

	Some descendants of the capitalist reactionary line have used the tactic of 'infiltrate and pull out,' disguising themselves and sneaking into revolutionary rebel organizations, 'using the flag to frighten others,' deceiving and swindling. Some royalists, after grabbing a few straws in the 'January 22nd' power seizure, yielded to the trend and shouted a few 'support' slogans, then took the opportunity to launch a ferocious attack on some revolutionary rebel organizations with flaws and errors, carrying out a counter-revolutionary counterattack. The ghosts and demons in society are stirring, attempting to fish in troubled waters and seize the opportunity to rebel. They direct their spears at the broad masses of cadres in streets and production teams, seeking class revenge, attempting to completely negate the great achievements of the 'Four Cleanups' movement, and negate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. All this sounds the alarm for us: the enemy is sharpening their knives, and the question of who wins and who loses has not been truly settled. Although the situation is good, the intense class struggle between the two lines is still ongoing. Therefore, rectifying our proletarian revolutionary ranks, enhancing combat effectiveness, and uniting against the enemy are urgent tasks. Rectification is a necessity for the current revolutionary situation. The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Committee's call for a comprehensive rectification movement is completely correct.

	To achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and seize power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must currently focus on overcoming the following erroneous tendencies that hinder further great unity within the proletarian revolutionary ranks:

	Some responsible comrades in certain revolutionary rebel organizations have serious tendencies of sectarianism, cliquism, regionalism, and localism. They forget the revolutionary interests of the proletarian revolutionary masses as a whole, only paying attention to the interests of their own small groups, using the expansion of the revolutionary ranks as a cover to expand their own cliques, even losing principles and recruiting some sharp-minded 'conservative' elements into the revolutionary organizations, confusing the class lines. They think they have power, establish their own factions, and act independently, turning a mass revolutionary organization into an independent kingdom. They do not treat brother revolutionary organizations equally, do not look at others' directions, do not see others' strengths and advantages, do not use others' strengths to make up for their own weaknesses, but instead suspect and exclude each other, even thinking 'I am the greatest,' having only themselves and no others, monopolizing everything, 'only I am revolutionary,' supporting those who agree with them and eliminating those who disagree, even resorting to disorderly beating and smashing against brother revolutionary organizations. This sectarianism causes disunity, loose relationships, greatly weakens the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organizations, and seriously hinders the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses. If this sectarianism continues, it will lead to the wrong path, be used by the class enemy to do evil, and is very dangerous.

	In some revolutionary rebel organizations, there is a tendency of disorder and lack of discipline. This tendency is manifested in independence, fragmentation, not adhering to policies, not willing to act in unity, rude and reckless behavior, wanting only democracy and not unity, wanting only freedom and not discipline, wanting only personal comfort and not a unified will, not seeking common ground while reserving differences on the basis of a unified direction, but instead entangling in non-principled and trivial issues. These erroneous tendencies are very harmful to the current great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the struggle to seize power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party.

	Currently, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party is colluding with the ghosts and demons in society and some 'conservative' elements, forming counter-revolutionary organizations and 'unions' to attack revolutionary organizations and resist the great unity of the revolution. They are trying to create chaos. You rebel, they also 'rebel'; you seize power, they also 'seize power'; you say you are a revolutionary rebel, they also claim to be 'revolutionary rebels.' True and false are mixed, false and true are mixed. Some bad elements, taking the opportunity of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the struggle to seize power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, also infiltrate the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses under the banner of 'revolutionary rebels,' stirring up trouble and creating incidents, attempting to split and disintegrate our ranks, and sabotage the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, in order to achieve their goal of seizing proletarian power. In this complex struggle, some responsible comrades in revolutionary rebel organizations often do not deeply investigate the masses, do not conduct investigations, do not make class analyses, and make hasty judgments and conclusions, resulting in wrong decisions and wrong work methods, causing losses to the revolutionary cause.

	Currently, revolutionary rebel organizations also have some erroneous ideas that need to be eliminated regarding how to deal with leading cadres. A relatively common idea is to use 'masses' and 'cadres,' 'general cadres' and 'leading cadres' as standards to distinguish between revolutionaries and non-revolutionaries, treating all cadres as sidelined, and all leading cadres as overthrown; not looking at whether cadres who have made mistakes have recognized and corrected their mistakes, or the nature and severity of their mistakes, but treating them all the same, nitpicking, and even holding grudges. This approach of not making specific class analyses of cadres, not implementing the policy of distinguishing between different situations, and generally opposing and overthrowing all, is completely wrong. This is very unfavorable to the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the struggle to seize power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party.

	In the current power struggle, the tendencies of localism, sectarianism, fragmentation, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, liberalism, subjectivism, and individualism, these messy bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, no matter how they change, all boil down to one thing: individualism, the 'private' character. This is a reactionary trend that is diametrically opposed to Mao Zedong Thought, a reflection of class struggle within the proletarian revolutionary ranks, a great enemy in our minds, a serious obstacle to the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and must be resolutely and thoroughly smashed.

	With the 'private' character in command, one must inevitably compete for fame, position, power, and benefits, and seek to stand out, inevitably having a narrow vision and being unable to have a broad mind for the country and the world. With the 'private' character in command, revolution will inevitably not be resolute and thorough, inevitably becoming a defender of personal and small group interests. Therefore, at critical moments, one will not be able to distinguish right from wrong and friend from foe, be used by the enemy, and lose the direction of the struggle, turning to the opposite side. Today, among those walking the capitalist road, there are many who were rebels of the old world, but these people, with the 'private' character in command, eventually fell into the capitalist mire. These bitter lessons are what today's proletarian revolutionaries must learn from. Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." This is an absolute truth. Every proletarian revolutionary must, while transforming the objective world, also transform their subjective world. We must heavily bombard and burn the bourgeois command headquarters in our minds, like Comrade Lei Feng: treat individualism like autumn winds sweeping fallen leaves. We must revolutionize our souls and fight against the 'private' character in our minds, daring to fight to the death. Without determination, without touching a sore spot, it is not easy to seize the power of the 'private' character in our minds.

	Every proletarian revolutionary must take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, actively engage in ideological struggle, smash the 'private' character, establish the 'public' character, and learn from Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, Mai Xiande, Cai Yongxiang, and other heroes who are dedicated to the public and to the revolution, truly becoming "a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended low-level interests, and a person who benefits the people."

	The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Rebel Committee calls on all proletarian revolutionaries in the city: We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. Currently, we must focus on studying Chairman Mao's works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and the "Three Articles." Chairman Mao's brilliant works are treasures for increasing revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. At the same time, we must seriously study important articles such as the editorial "On the Struggle for Power by the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses" in the third issue of the Red Flag magazine. We must firmly grasp the powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. The leaders of revolutionary rebel organizations at all levels must set an example, heavily touch their souls, and become models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	In the past, the Japanese imperialists said: "We are not afraid of the Eighth Route Army training, but we are afraid of the Eighth Route Army rectifying its style." Similarly, today, imperialism, modern revisionism, and the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party are most afraid of us proletarian revolutionaries mastering the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, most afraid of us smashing the 'private' character and achieving revolutionization, most afraid of us achieving the broadest and most solid great unity, and most afraid of our red mountains remaining unchanged for thousands of years. The revolutionary torrent rolls eastward, surging forward. Let those capitalist bosses tremble! Let them have hysterical fits! The wheels of history will roll forward at an even faster pace. The mighty army of the proletarian revolutionaries will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely along the course opened by Chairman Mao!

    大破“私”字，大立“公”字，夺取新的伟大胜利！
    青岛市革命造反委员会给青岛市革命造反组织的公开信
    新华社青岛二十日电　青岛市革命造反委员会向青岛市革命造反组织发出一封题为《打倒私字，整顿作风，夺取新的伟大胜利！》的公开信。全文如下：
    “一·二二”，青岛市无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下实现了大联合，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，一举夺下了青岛市党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所掌握的党、政、财、文大权。“一月革命”的狂飚，无情地摧毁了一切修正主义的老巢，一场群众性的自下而上的全面夺权斗争正在轰轰烈烈地深入开展。广大的工人革命派自从登上了政治舞台，就显示了无比的威力。他们狠抓革命，大促生产，精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量，超额完成了一月份的总产值计划，夺得了伟大胜利，给了那些“走着瞧”的资产阶级老爷们当头一棒。崂山县的贫下中农也杀出来了，革命农民运动如燎原烈火，熊熊地燃烧起来。他们正在冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。“抓革命，促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮”是他们的战斗口号。革命学生沿着毛主席指明的方向，有组织、有计划地走向工厂、农村，和工农相结合，走历史的必由之路，从而在革命化的大道上又迈进了一步。毛泽东思想光焰无际的阳光普照着新生的青岛。凯歌阵阵，烈火熊熊，一派令人欢欣鼓舞的大好革命形势展现在我们面前。
    但是阶级敌人决不会自行退出历史舞台。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派眼看失掉了自己的天堂，对无产阶级革命派恨之入骨。他们背地里煽阴风，点鬼火，费尽心机破坏生产，破坏国民经济，破坏国家财产，妄图嫁祸于新掌权的无产阶级革命派，妄图把新生的政权扼杀在摇篮里，其用心何其毒也！
    有些资产阶级反动路线的孝子贤孙们，采用了打进来，拉出去的办法，削尖了脑袋，乔装打扮一番，钻进了革命造反组织中，“拉大旗做虎皮，包着自己吓唬别人”，招摇撞骗。有些保皇的家伙在“一·二二”夺权问题上捞到了几根稻草，迫于大势所趋，喊了几句“支持”的口号，就趁机以十倍的疯狂向一些有缺点错误的革命造反组织发起了猖狂的进攻，进行反革命反扑。社会上的牛鬼蛇神蠢蠢欲动，妄图混水摸鱼，乘机翻天。他们把矛头指向街道上和生产队的广大干部，实行阶级报复，妄图全盘否定“四清”运动的伟大成果，否定毛主席的革命路线，……这一切都给我们敲响了警钟：敌人在磨刀霍霍，谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。形势虽然大好，但两条路线的阶级大搏斗还在激烈地进行。因此，整顿我们无产阶级革命派的内部，增强战斗力，团结对敌，实在是当务之急。整风是当前革命形势的需要。青岛市革命造反委员会向全市无产阶级革命派发出开展全面整风的号召是完全正确的。
    为了胜利完成无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争任务，为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，当前在无产阶级革命派内部，应着重克服以下妨碍进一步大联合的错误倾向：
    有些革命造反组织的某些负责人，存在严重的小团体主义、宗派主义、山头主义、本位主义等错误思想。他们忘记了无产阶级革命派全局的革命利益，只注意自己小团体的利益，以扩大革命队伍为名，行发展小团体之实，甚至失掉原则，把一些削尖脑袋的保字号人物，也网罗到革命组织中来，混淆了阶级阵营。他们自以为有势力，自立门户，各自为政，把一个群众性革命组织，变成独立王国。对兄弟革命组织不是平等相待，不看别人的大方向，不看人家的长处和优点，不是以人之长补己之短，而是互相猜疑，互相排斥，甚至“老子天下第一”，有己无人，独霸一切，“唯我革命”，顺我者昌，逆我者亡，甚至竟对兄弟的革命组织采取乱打、乱砸的做法。这种小团体主义，使团结涣散，关系松懈，大大削弱了革命组织的战斗力，严重阻碍无产阶级革命派的大联合。这种小团体主义发展下去就会走上邪路，被阶级敌人利用做坏事，是非常危险的。
    在一些革命造反组织中，存在着无组织无纪律的倾向。这种倾向表现为闹独立，搞分散，不讲政策，不愿统一行动，粗暴蛮干，只要民主，不要集中，只要自由，不要纪律，只要个人心情舒畅，不要统一意志，不是在大方向一致的基础上求同存异，而是在一些非原则问题、枝节问题上纠缠不清。这些错误倾向，对于当前无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，是十分有害的。
    目前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，正在同社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，同一些保字号的人物勾结起来，拚凑起反革命的组织、反革命的“联合”来攻击革命组织，来对抗革命的大联合。他们极力制造假相，制造混乱。你造反，他也“造反”；你夺权，他也“夺权”；你说你是革命造反派，他也自称是“革命造反派”。真真假假，假假真真。有些坏人，趁着无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的机会，也打着“革命造反”的旗号，钻进无产阶级革命派的队伍中来，兴风作浪，制造事端，妄图分裂和瓦解我们的阵营，破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，以达到他们夺取无产阶级大权的目的。在这种复杂的斗争中，有些革命造反组织的负责人，往往不深入群众，不调查研究，不作阶级分析，就轻率地作判断、下结论，以致作出了错误的决定，采取了错误的工作方法，使革命事业遭受损失。
    目前革命造反组织，在怎样对待领导干部的问题上，也存在着一些急待消除的错误思想。比较普遍的是，以“群众”和“干部”、“一般干部”和“领导干部”，来作为划分革命或不革命的标准，凡是干部就一律靠边站，凡是领导干部就一律打倒；对于犯过这样或那样错误的领导干部，不看他是否已经认识了错误，改正了错误，也不看他所犯错误的性质、轻重程度如何，一样地看待，一味斤斤计较，甚至抓住不放。这样对干部不作具体的阶级分析，不实行区别对待的政策，一概反对，一概打倒，是完全错误的。这对无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，是非常不利的。
    在当前夺权斗争中突出暴露出来的本位主义、小团体主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、自由主义、主观主义、个人主义等资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮这些乌七八糟的东西，万变不离其宗，归结到一点就是一个个人主义，就是一个私字。这是一种和毛泽东思想针锋相对的反动思潮，是阶级斗争在无产阶级革命派内部的反映，是我们头脑里的大敌，是实现无产阶级革命派大联合的严重障碍，必须坚决、彻底地将其打倒。
    私字挂帅，必然要争名，争位，争权，夺利，争出风头，必然是鼠目寸光，不能胸怀祖国，放眼世界。私字挂帅，革命必然不坚决、不彻底，必然成为个人和小集团的既得利益维护者。因此，在关键时刻就会是非不明，敌我不分，被敌人利用，以致迷失斗争的大方向，走向自己的反面。今天在走资本主义道路的当权派中有许多人都是当年旧世界的造反者，但这些人私字挂帅，久而久之就堕落到资产阶级的泥坑中去。这些惨痛教训，是我们今天的无产阶级革命者所必须引以为戒的。林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”这是千真万确的真理。我们每一个无产阶级革命者都应在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。对自己头脑中的资产阶级司令部要重炮猛轰，要烈火猛烧，要象雷锋同志那样：对待个人主义要象秋风扫落叶一样。要在灵魂深处闹革命，要在脑子里同私字拼刺刀，敢于刺刀见红。不下狠心，不触疼一下，是不容易夺下自己头脑里私字的权的。
    每个无产阶级革命者，都应该拿起批评与自我批评这个武器，展开积极的思想斗争，大破私字，大立公字，大学雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、麦贤得、蔡永祥等一心为公、一心为革命的英雄，真正做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。
    青岛市革命造反委员会向全市无产阶级革命派发出号召：一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮。当前要重点学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、“老三篇”等著作，毛主席的这些光辉著作是增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性的法宝。同时还要认真学习《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》等重要文章。我们一定要牢牢地掌握毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器。革命造反组织的各级领导同志，一定要以身作则，狠触自己的灵魂，成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范。
    当年，日本帝国主义者说：“不怕八路军大练兵，就怕八路军大整风。”同样，今天帝国主义、现代修正主义和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，最害怕的是我们无产阶级革命派掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，最害怕我们打倒私字实现革命化，最怕我们实现最广泛的巩固的大联合，最怕我们的红色江山千秋万代永不变色。革命的洪流滚滚东去，波涛汹涌一泻千里。让那些资产阶级老爷们发抖去吧！歇斯底里大发作去吧！历史的车轮将以更迅猛的速度向前急驰。无产阶级革命派浩浩荡荡的大军，将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席开辟的航道奋勇前进！
