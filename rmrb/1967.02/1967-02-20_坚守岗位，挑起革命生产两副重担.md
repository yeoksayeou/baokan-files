Currently, the revolutionary storm in the countryside is like a raging fire, burning the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, driving them to despair. Their doom is near. At this critical moment, these elements are stirring up a perverse wind, attempting to lead the revolutionary movement in the countryside astray. Seeing that the knowledge youth who have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside, along with the poor and lower-middle peasants, have risen up to rebel against them, they maliciously incite the knowledge youth to rush to the cities. They say things like, "Go to the cities to make trouble, that's where you can solve problems." They even say, "You came down to the countryside, it's too hard, better to be a worker in the city." Under the incitement of these bad elements, some knowledge youth who do not understand the truth blindly flow into the cities.

Facing this situation, the more than fifty knowledge youth in our brigade have repeatedly studied the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us, "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing to and actually do combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants." After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, we saw through the tricks and deceits of those who incite us to leave our production posts. Some comrades angrily said, "We responded to Chairman Mao's call and came to the countryside. Those bad elements hate us to the core precisely because they fundamentally oppose Mao Zedong Thought from the root. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Whoever opposes it, we will resolutely fight to the end!"

Through our study, we realized that this is a serious class struggle. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stop this perverse wind, and repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. No matter what tricks the enemy plays, we will not fall for them, hold fast to our posts, and make a revolution right where we are. Currently, the busy season for spring farming is approaching. We are determined to hold fast to our posts, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, take the lead in labor, and strive for victory in both revolution and production.

    坚守岗位，挑起革命生产两副重担
    山东省单县谢集公社红旗大队　五十六名下乡知识青年
    目前，农村的革命风暴象烈火一样，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子烧得焦头烂额，他们的末日到了。就在这个时候，这些家伙又煽起一股歪风，企图把农村的革命运动引到邪路上去。他们看到上山下乡知识青年和贫下中农一道起来造他们的反了，便别有用心地煽动知识青年涌到城市去。他们说什么：“你们到城市去闹吧，到那里去可以解决问题。”他们甚至说：“你们下乡来，太辛苦了，不如在城市当工人。”在这些坏家伙的煽动下，一些不明真相的上山下乡知识青年，便盲目地流进了城市。
    面对这种情况，我们这个大队的五十多个下乡知识青年反复地学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”我们学习了毛主席的指示，对那些煽动我们离开生产岗位的阴谋诡计一眼就看穿了。有的同志气愤地说：“我们响应毛主席的号召来到农村，那些坏家伙所以恨之入骨，就是因为他们从根本上反对毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，谁反对，我们就和他坚决斗争到底！”
    我们通过学习，认识到这是一场严肃的阶级斗争。我们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决煞住这股歪风，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。不管敌人耍什么鬼把戏，我们决不上他们的当，坚守岗位，就地大闹革命。当前，春耕生产的农忙季节即将到来，我们决心坚守岗位，肩负革命、生产两副重担，带头劳动，力争革命、生产双胜利。
