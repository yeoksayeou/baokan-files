In the storm of the great alliance and great seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary masses, correctly handling cadres has become the key to the development of the movement. Over half a year of struggle has taught us: only by strictly implementing Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and achieving a "triple alliance" of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, local garrison commanders of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres of party and government organs, can we accomplish a genuine seizure of power by the proletariat, consolidate the revolutionary regime, and achieve a thorough victory in the seizure of power.

The idea and practice of not distinguishing right from wrong, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything regarding leading cadres are contrary to the class standpoint of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Those in power have never been above class; they are either proletarian leaders or bourgeois leaders. Many revolutionary leading cadres in party and government organs followed Chairman Mao closely during the war years, risking their lives for the revolution. Since liberation, they have fought resolutely against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. Today, they are again resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, standing on the side of the revolutionary rebels, and fighting and winning together with the revolutionary masses. These cadres are the proletarian revolutionary rebels among the leading cadres, a precious asset of the party. Without them as the backbone of the seizure of power struggle and participating in the "triple alliance" leadership core, there is no guarantee for the great alliance and great seizure of power by the revolutionary faction.

Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for revolution." In the cultural revolution movement, we have deeply felt: a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party are our enemies. The revolutionary cadres within the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, led by Comrade Pan Fusheng, are our comrades. Although they have made various mistakes, under the great call of Chairman Mao and the impetus of the mass movement, they have resolutely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly relying on the proletarian red rebels, and fought against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee. We firmly support and fight shoulder to shoulder with such revolutionary leading cadres, seize power together, and share power together.

Our revolutionary friendship with the revolutionary cadres within the Provincial Party Committee, led by Comrade Pan Fusheng, was established in the life-and-death struggle. In mid-August last year, when a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party incited a massive attack on the red rebels, Comrade Pan Fusheng, following Chairman Mao's teachings, stood up and supported the revolutionary rebels, fighting resolutely against the capitalist-roaders. At that time, we were under attack, and Comrade Pan Fusheng was also under attack. In early September last year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party created another white terror, attacking Comrade Pan Fusheng, but he stood firm and fought his way out with us!

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the unyielding stance of the proletariat have closely united the revolutionary cadres led by Comrade Pan Fusheng with us, the red rebels. Through long-term joint struggles, we have come to understand that the revolutionary cadres within the Provincial Party Committee, led by Comrade Pan Fusheng, are completely trustworthy. Not daring to trust and support the proletarian leaders who have been tested is a typical example of being "left" in form but right in essence. The proletarian revolutionary nature of the red rebels is shown in their daring to fight resolutely against the capitalist-roaders within the party and their unity with the revolutionary cadres who adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Our process of implementing Chairman Mao's policies on cadres is also a process of struggling against the bourgeois reactionary line. When we resolutely supported the revolutionary cadres within the Provincial Party Committee, led by Comrade Pan Fusheng, the "conservative" organizations controlled by the capitalist-roaders within the party launched a fierce counterattack. They shouted: "We won't rest until we bring down Pan Fusheng!" It seems they really want to shed their conservative hats and rise up in revolution. However, using Chairman Mao's class analysis, their true colors are exposed. They stand on the reactionary bourgeois stance, opposing the proletarian leaders, protecting the bourgeois leaders, and under the pretext of attacking Pan Fusheng, they aim to undermine the "triple alliance" and seize power at an opportune moment. Those involved in this "wild bombardment" are not only class enemies but also a considerable number of confused people. They do not draw the line between revolution and counter-revolution. They do not understand: "The shortcomings of the people need to be criticized, ... but one must speak from the standpoint of protecting and educating the people with full enthusiasm. If one treats comrades as enemies, one has stood on the enemy's side."

Do we firmly implement Chairman Mao's policies on cadres? Do we dare to firmly support the proletarian revolutionary faction among the leading cadres? For those who have made mistakes, is it "learning from the past to avoid future mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient" or "mercilessly striking"? This is a severe test for the proletarian revolutionary faction. Those who do not allow revolutionary cadres to come forward and do not allow them to return to the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are definitely not genuine revolutionary rebels.

Half a year of struggle has made us deeply realize the importance of Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party." Only by firmly implementing Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and actively supporting the proletarian leaders can we combine efforts from above and below, attack from within and without, thoroughly overthrow the capitalist-roaders, and achieve victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团
    在无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的革命暴风雨中，正确对待干部已成为运动发展的关键。半年多来的斗争经验告诉我们：只有不折不扣地执行毛主席制定的干部政策，实现革命群众组织的代表、人民解放军当地驻军负责人和党政机关的革命领导干部“三结合”，才能完成真正的无产阶级大夺权，才能巩固革命政权，获得夺权斗争的彻底胜利。
    对于领导干部不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的想法和做法，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的。当权派从来没有超阶级的，不是无产阶级的当权派，就是资产阶级的当权派。党政机关中不少革命领导干部，在战争年代是紧跟毛主席，为革命不惜赴汤蹈火的。解放以来，他们和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行过坚决的斗争。今天，他们又坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，站在革命造反派一边，和革命群众战斗在一起，胜利在一起。这些干部是领导干部中的无产阶级革命造反派，是党的宝贵财富。没有他们作为夺权斗争的骨干，参加“三结合”的领导核心，革命派大联合、大夺权就没有充分的保证。
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”在文化革命运动中，我们切身体会到：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是我们革命造反派的敌人。黑龙江省委内以潘复生同志为首的革命干部，是我们的同志。尽管他们也犯过这样那样的错误，但是在毛主席的伟大号召下，在群众运动的推动下，他们毅然决然地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决依靠无产阶级红色造反者，与原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开斗争。对于这样的革命领导干部，我们坚决支持，并肩作战，共同夺权，共同掌权。
    我们和以潘复生同志为首的省委内部的革命干部的革命友谊，是在生死与共的战斗中建立起来的。去年八月中旬，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派煽动对红色造反者大围攻的时候，潘复生同志按照毛主席的教导挺身而出，站在毛主席的革命路线一边，支持革命造反派，同走资本主义道路的当权派进行坚决的斗争。那时候，我们受围攻，潘复生同志也受围攻。去年九月初，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派又一次制造白色恐怖，围攻潘复生同志，但是他顶住了，和我们一起冲杀出来了！
    毛主席的革命路线，无产阶级的坚定立场，把以潘复生同志为首的革命干部和我们红色造反者紧密地连结在一起。在长期的共同战斗的考验中，我们认识到，省委内以潘复生同志为首的革命干部是完全可以信赖的。对经过考验的无产阶级的当权派不敢信任，不敢支持，就是典型的形“左”实右。红色造反者坚定的无产阶级革命性，就表现在他们敢于和党内走资本主义道路的当权派坚决斗争，也表现在和坚持毛主席革命路线的革命干部结合。
    我们执行毛主席干部政策的过程，也是和资产阶级反动路线进行斗争的过程。当我们坚决支持以潘复生同志为首的省委内革命干部的时候，党内走资本主义道路的当权派所操纵的保字号组织又进行猖狂反扑。他们狂叫：“不把潘复生拉下马，死不瞑目！”看来，他们好象真要甩掉保守帽子，起来革命。可是，用毛主席的阶级分析观点一剖视，他们就原形毕露了。他们是站在资产阶级反动立场上，反对无产阶级当权派，保护资产阶级当权派，以炮轰潘复生之名，行搞垮“三结合”伺机进行反夺权之实。参与这种“狂轰滥炸”行径的，除了阶级敌人而外，还有相当一批糊涂人。他们不划分革命和反革命的界线，他们不懂得：“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的，……但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话。如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”
    是不是坚决执行毛主席的干部政策？敢不敢坚决支持领导干部中的无产阶级革命派？对于犯了错误的同志，是“惩前毖后、治病救人”还是“无情打击”？这是对无产阶级革命派的严峻考验。不许革命干部站出来，不准他们回到毛主席革命路线一边，这样的人决不是真正的革命造反派。
    半年来的斗争实践，使我们深刻体会到毛主席的干部政策的重要性。“政策和策略是党的生命”，只有坚决地执行毛主席的干部政策，积极支持无产阶级的当权派，才能上下结合，内外夹攻，彻底打倒走资本主义道路的当权派，取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
