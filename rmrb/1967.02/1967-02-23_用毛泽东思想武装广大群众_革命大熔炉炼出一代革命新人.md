Revolutionaries around the world have pointed out with great enthusiasm that in just over half a year, this mass movement, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, has shown an "overwhelming momentum" that can "change heaven and earth," and a "tremendous force" that can "revolutionize the world." The leader of the Belgian Communist Party, Grivas, noted that this indicates, "Once great revolutionary ideas are grasped by the masses, they will become an invincible material force." The Albanian newspaper *Voice of the People* stated: "The great revolutionary movement underway under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, which aims to uproot the sources of revisionism, is an inspiring example for all genuine revolutionaries around the world. For the true communists and revolutionary youth in the Soviet Union and other countries where revisionism has seized power, this example is particularly inspiring and motivating. It points the way to struggle against revisionism, which is the path of revolutionary mass movements, and the path of mobilizing the masses to expose revisionist betrayal and sweep away all revisionism."

An Italian revolutionary, discussing the glorious victories achieved by this mass movement, pointed out, "This proves that only by believing in the masses and implementing the policy of 'from the masses, to the masses,' can we build socialism and prepare for the transition to communism."

World revolutionaries deeply admire that in this mass revolution that touches people's souls, hundreds of millions of Chinese proletarian revolutionaries are overthrowing the bourgeois worldview in their minds and seizing the ideological power of the bourgeoisie. The Executive Committee of the Uruguayan Left Revolutionary Movement issued a statement saying: "This is a true and profound ideological revolution that turns Marxism-Leninism into the worldview of the entire Chinese people." The Albanian newspaper *Voice of the People* also pointed out in an editorial that this is an unprecedented movement where "the broad masses arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionize their thinking, and revolutionize the entire life of the country." "This powerful conscious revolutionary movement of the broad masses has immeasurable and profound historical significance." Many revolutionaries also said that this great revolution is a "great school for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought," and a "great school for the broad laboring masses, especially the new generation, to undergo revolutionary tempering." After experiencing the great storm of this mass struggle and witnessing the great spectacle of this mass struggle, a batch of revolutionary young people who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to rebel, and dare to innovate, a new generation of revolutionary successors of the proletariat, and a new type of intellectual force of the working class have been fostered and forged.

    用毛泽东思想武装广大群众 
    革命大熔炉炼出一代革命新人
    世界革命者无比热情地指出，仅仅半年多时间，这场在毛泽东思想指引下发动起来的群众运动，就显示出了一种可以“改天换地”的“磅礴气势”，一种可以“扭转乾坤”的“巨大力量”。比利时共产党领导人格里巴指出，这表明，“伟大的革命思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成不可战胜的物质力量”。阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》说：“在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下正在蓬勃发展的挖掉产生修正主义根源的这场伟大革命运动，对于全世界的所有真正革命者是具有鼓舞作用的一个范例。对于苏联及其他被修正主义篡夺了政权的国家的真正的共产党人和革命青年，这一范例尤其具有鼓舞和推动作用。它指出了同修正主义作斗争的道路，这就是采取革命的群众运动的道路，就是发动群众揭露修正主义的背叛、横扫一切修正主义的道路。”意大利一位革命者在谈到这一群众运动所取得的辉煌胜利时指出，“这证明，只有相信群众，执行从群众中来、到群众中去的政策，才能建设社会主义并为向共产主义过渡作准备。”
    世界革命者衷心钦佩，在这场群众性的触及人们灵魂的大革命中，中国亿万无产阶级革命派正在革自己头脑里资产阶级世界观的命，夺自己头脑里资产阶级思想的权。乌拉圭左派革命运动执行委员会发表声明说：这“是把马克思列宁主义变为全中国人民的世界观的一次真正的深刻的意识形态的革命。”阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》在一篇编辑部文章中也指出，这是广大群众“用毛泽东思想武装起来，使自己的思想革命化，使整个国家的生活革命化的史无前例的运动”。“广大人民群众的这一强大的自觉革命运动，具有不可估量的重大历史意义”。许多革命者还说，这场大革命，就是“学习和运用毛泽东思想的大学校”，就是“广大劳动群众，特别是新生一代经受革命锻炼的大学校”。经过这场群众斗争的大风雨，见过这场群众斗争的大世面，一批敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢造反的革命小将，一代革命化的无产阶级接班人，一支新型的工人阶级的知识分子队伍被培养和造就出来了。
