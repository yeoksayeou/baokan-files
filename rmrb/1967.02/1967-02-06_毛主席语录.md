	The rampancy of all internal and external dark forces has brought about national disasters; however, this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have some strength, but also indicates their final struggles, and signifies that the people are gradually approaching victory. This is the case in China, in the entire East, and in the world.

    毛主席语录
    一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。这在中国是如此，在整个东方也是如此，在世界也是如此。
                                        《新民主主义论》
