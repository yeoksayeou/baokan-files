The great "January Revolution" was like a thunderclap, shaking the seven hundred million people of China and the entire world!

Chairman Mao pointed out: The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the final analysis, is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for a comprehensive seizure of power.

In seizing power, we must seize the power from the capitalist roaders within the party, and also seize the power of the "self" character from our own minds. If we do not seize the power of the "self" character from our own minds, even if we seize the power from the capitalist roaders within the party, it will still not be consolidated and may even be lost again. Therefore, seizing power is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and also a struggle between the "public" and the "self" in our own minds.

Comrade Lin Biao said: We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. In the practice of great unity and seizing power, we deeply feel the correctness of this teaching. We must, while transforming the objective world, also transform our subjective world, thoroughly eliminate bourgeois thoughts, and thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must use the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to declare war on the "self" character, so that we can be invincible in great unity and seizing power and always stand unshakable.

Under the oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, we red revolutionaries did not yield. We stood firmly together and, undaunted, fought against the capitalist roaders within the party. However, in the new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, where the revolutionary masses unite and seize power, errors such as factionalism, cliquism, subjectivism, individualism, ultra-democracy, anti-organizational views, and distrust of the masses have emerged among us red revolutionaries.

These erroneous tendencies are, in the final analysis, the result of the "self" character. Why, at this critical moment of the revolution, does the "self" character stir up trouble in the minds of some red revolutionaries? Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Because of victory, arrogance, the tendency to regard oneself as a hero, the tendency to stop and not seek progress, the tendency to indulge in pleasure and not want to live a hard life, may grow." We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching and be vigilant at all times.

Facing these erroneous thoughts, we do not avoid them or fear them, but we confront them and deal with them correctly. Because Chairman Mao teaches us: "Differences and struggles between different thoughts within the party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the party, the life of the party will also stop."

How do we deal with them correctly? We follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Always pay attention to the ideological unity within the ranks." In the fiery struggle of great unity and seizing power, we launched a serious rectification movement on the front line.

In this rectification movement, we red revolutionaries studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party," the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and "Opposing Liberalism." We also studied relevant quotations from Chairman Mao according to specific ideological situations. We studied and applied them thoroughly, and practiced broad proletarian democracy among the red revolutionary ranks. Everyone adopted the attitude of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and engaged in criticism and self-criticism with the spirit of "speaking without fear, speaking without reserve," "the speaker is without guilt, the listener takes warning," and "if there is a fault, correct it; if there is none, be vigilant."

The key lies in the leadership. Therefore, this rectification first sincerely helped the core comrades among the red revolutionaries. Some comrades could not accept different opinions, so we studied with them Chairman Mao's teachings on the five conditions for cultivating successors. Some comrades believed only in their own revolution and not in others' revolution, so we studied with them Chairman Mao's quotations on the mass line. Practice has proven that studying Chairman Mao's works, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and conducting open rectification and criticism and self-criticism is the best way to seize power from the "self" character in our minds. We composed a ditty during this rectification:

	Red revolutionaries study the "Three Constantly Read Articles,"
	Cast aside selfish thoughts;
	Core comrades study the "Three Constantly Read Articles,"
	Swear to be servants of the people.

This ditty expresses the red revolutionaries' determination to study during the rectification.

Through open rectification, the thoughts of the red revolutionaries were unified, and the Foundry Workshop saw a new situation in seizing power and promoting production. In these days, our output has significantly increased.

In the struggle, we deeply felt: The key to achieving great unity among the revolutionary masses is to break with selfishness and establish public spirit; the seizure of power by the revolutionary masses is to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions. In the struggle of great unity and seizing power, the "self" character is the root of errors such as factionalism, cliquism, sectarianism, and ultra-democracy. The "self" character is the source of all evil. If we do not smash the "self" character to pieces, the revolutionary masses cannot unite, and the proletariat cannot truly seize power. The only way to smash the "self" character is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and carry out the rectification movement. The capitalist roaders within the party, who occupy the "self" character in their minds, fear the great rectification by the red revolutionaries. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must touch our souls deeply and seize power from the "self" character in our minds.

In the rectification movement on the front line, although we have achieved some results, the "self" character is very stubborn and can come out to cause trouble and counterattack us at any time!

We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must rebel against the "self" character to the end.

    火线整风　向私字夺权
    北京第一机床厂　铸工“红旗”战斗总队
    伟大的“一月革命”，犹如万钧雷霆，震动了七亿神州，震动了全世界！
    毛主席指出：革命的根本问题是政权问题。这场无产阶级文化大革命，归根结底，就是无产阶级向资产阶级进行全面大夺权的生死搏斗。
    大夺权，既要夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，也要夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，如果不把自己头脑里“私”字的权夺走，即使夺了党内走资本主义道路当权派的权，也仍然不能巩固，甚至还会得而复失。所以，大夺权，是无产阶级与资产阶级的搏斗，也是自己头脑里“公”字与“私”字的搏斗。
    林彪副主席说：我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。在大联合、大夺权的实践中，我们深深体会到这一教导的正确，必须在改造客观世界的同时，又改造自己的主观世界，大灭资产阶级思想，大树毛泽东思想，用伟大的毛泽东思想做武器，向“私”字宣战，才能在大联合、大夺权中无往而不胜，永远立于不败之地。
    在资产阶级反动路线的高压下，我们红色造反者没有屈服，我们紧紧团结在一起，百折不挠地和党内走资本主义道路的当权派进行了斗争。但在无产阶级文化大革命进入无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的崭新阶段，我们红色造反者内部却出现了山头主义、小团体主义、主观主义、个人主义、极端民主化、非组织观点、不相信群众等等错误倾向。
    这些错误倾向，归根结底，就是一个“私”字。为什么在革命发展的关键时刻，“私”字会在一些红色造反者的头脑里兴风作浪呢？毛主席早就教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”我们必须牢记毛主席的这一教导，时刻警惕。
    面对这些错误思想，我们不是回避它，害怕它，而是正视它，用正确的态度处理它。因为毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”
    怎样才能正确处理呢？我们按照毛主席的教导：“随时注意队伍内部的思想统一”，在大联合、大夺权的火热的斗争中，开展了严肃的批评和自我批评的火线整风运动。
    在火线整风中，我们红色造反者学习了毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、“老三篇”、《反对自由主义》，并且针对具体的思想情况，学习有关的毛主席语录。我们狠学狠用，在红色造反者队伍中实行广泛的无产阶级大民主，每个人都抱着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度，展开了“知无不言，言无不尽”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”的批评和自我批评。
    关键在于领导。因此，这次整风，首先是对红色造反者的核心同志进行诚恳的帮助。有的同志听不进不同意见，我们就和他一起学习毛主席关于培养接班人的五个条件。有的同志只相信自己革命，不相信别人革命，我们就和他一起学习毛主席关于群众路线的语录。实践证明，学习毛主席著作，相信群众，依靠群众，开门整风，进行批评与自我批评，这是向头脑里的“私”字夺权的最好的办法。我们曾在这次整风中编了这样一首顺口溜：
    造反者学习“老三篇”，
    私心杂念丢一边；
    核心学了“老三篇”，
    誓做人民勤务员。
    这首顺口溜表达了红色造反者在整风中学习的决心。
    通过开门整风，红色造反者的思想统一了，铸工分厂的抓革命促生产出现了新的局面。这些日子，我们的产量有了显著的提高。
    在斗争中，我们深深体会到：实现无产阶级革命派大联合的关键，就是破私立公；无产阶级革命派的大夺权，就是让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。在大联合、大夺权的斗争中，“私”字是产生风头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、极端民主化等错误倾向的根子。“私”字是一切罪恶之源。不把“私”字砸个稀巴烂，无产阶级革命派就联合不起来，无产阶级就不能真正把政权夺到手。砸烂“私”字的唯一办法，就是活学活用毛主席著作，开展整风运动。党内走资本主义道路的当权派，盘踞在自己头脑里的“私”字，就怕红色造反者大整风。我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，狠触自己的灵魂，向自己头脑里的“私”字夺权。
    我们在火线整风运动里面，虽然取得了一些成绩，但“私”字这个东西顽固得很，随时会跑出来捣乱，随时会向我们红色造反者进行反扑！
    我们一定牢记毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们要对“私”字造反到底。
