The revolutionary rebel workers of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, after seizing power, are red-hearted and bold, with high spirits and fighting spirit. They actively seize the revolution and promote production. They completed the January production plan ahead of schedule.

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory carried a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and a huge model of Chairman Mao's four-volume works, beating drums and gongs, to report to the most beloved leader Chairman Mao that after seizing power, they have seized the revolution and promoted production, completing the January production plan ahead of schedule. The facts of this factory vividly illustrate that once the revolutionary rebels seize the leadership, revolution and production will present a completely new situation.

	The revolutionary rebels of this factory, after a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, gradually formed a strong revolutionary rebel army. By the end of November last year, they had seized the leadership of the Cultural Revolution. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, unwilling to accept their defeat, used their remaining control over production management and financial power to engage in counter-revolutionary economism, corrupting and bribing workers, and inciting some who were unaware of the truth to leave their production posts and go to the leadership offices to demand solutions to issues such as the student system, aiming to achieve their evil goal of disrupting production and the Cultural Revolution. They also used tactics such as "throwing down their tools and watching the joke" to resist and disrupt Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." In the first eighteen days of January, the entire factory only completed one-third of the monthly production tasks. The revolutionary rebel workers were extremely indignant at the sabotage by the capitalist-roaders in power within the party and were determined to drive these villains off the stage. "Without you capitalist lords, we will definitely do the revolution and production even better!"

	On January 19, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, together with other revolutionary rebel organizations in the factory, completely seized the power from the capitalist-roaders. All the political, economic, production management, and technical management powers of the entire factory were seized back into the hands of the revolutionary leftists!

		For the Glory of the Revolutionary Rebels

	This seizure of power greatly suppressed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat. Due to the sabotage by the capitalist-roaders, there were indeed many difficulties in production at that time. However, the revolutionary rebels, who had taken control, were red-hearted and bold, with high spirits and fighting spirit, and rushed into the battle against the difficulties. On January 31, they presented a report of good news to Chairman Mao, which summarized their mood at that time:

		"Dear Chairman Mao, in the face of a very arduous production task, we thought of you, and we had boundless courage and strength. We must resolutely fight for you and Comrade Lin Biao! For the glory of the revolutionary rebels! We are determined, fearing no sacrifice, even if it means climbing mountains of knives or crossing seas of fire, we will strive for the double victory of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production'!"

	The "Revolutionary Rebel Workshop" (originally the Sixth Workshop), which has always dared to fight bravely in the Cultural Revolution, held a rally to pledge to complete the task three days ahead of schedule and report to Chairman Mao. This workshop, which is responsible for the final assembly, also copied Chairman Mao's relevant quotations and poems and sent them to another final assembly workshop—the "Anti-Revisionist Workshop"—to encourage comrades to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. The bold fighters of the Revolutionary Rebel Workshop took measures such as reasonable adjustment of labor organization to fully tap the production potential and finally fulfilled their pledge. The revolutionary workers of the Anti-Revisionist Workshop, facing the difficulty of delayed supply of parts caused by the capitalist-roaders, took on the heavy tasks and also completed the production plan two days ahead of schedule.

	Before the revolutionary rebels of this factory seized power, due to the capitalist-roaders' infighting for fame and profit and the implementation of the Soviet revisionists' management system, "pushing, dragging, erasing, and pulling" became the norm, and mutual support among workshops was obstructed by the capitalist-roaders. Now that the revolutionary workers have taken power, the revisionist system has been smashed, and the obstacles to cooperation have been removed. In the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers have studied Chairman Mao's works actively and thoroughly, standing higher and seeing farther. They said: whether or not the production plan is completed is not just a problem for a small group or a workshop, but a problem of whether the entire factory can implement Chairman Mao's great call of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." Whether or not the production plan is completed is not just an economic issue, but also has great political significance. In the process of completing the January tasks, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory created many moving stories of united efforts to overcome difficulties.

	The phenomenon of "each for themselves" among groups, workshops, trades, and upper and lower processes has changed. To ensure that machine tools are delivered on time, assembly workers, after completing their tasks, would actively follow the machine tools to the painting and packing section to help with painting and packing.

		New-Type Leadership Team Leads the Charge

	After the revolutionary rebels of this factory seized power, they overthrew the bourgeois "officials," broke the old frameworks of rank and seniority, and established a new leadership team that emphasizes politics from top to bottom.

	In the past, all cadres above the section chief were off-duty, and even the planners and statisticians of the sections did not participate in production. Now, the members of the "Production Service Team Preparatory Committee" at the factory level are mostly not off-duty. The work of the workshop cadres is being explored in each workshop, with some partially off-duty and others not leaving production at all. Non-production personnel have been greatly reduced. Cadres and the masses maintain close relations at all times.

	The cadres at the factory level and workshop level are collectively referred to as service personnel, who often roll with the masses and blend in with them. In the struggle to achieve the double victory of revolution and production in January, service personnel at all levels led the charge. Wherever there were problems, they appeared. Because most of the service personnel at all levels were originally workers and now most of them are not off-duty, they understand the workers the best and are the most familiar with production. They command troops and arrange work in a way that best suits the actual situation. Thus, they led the broad revolutionary workers to overcome one difficulty after another and completed two-thirds of the production tasks in one-third of the time in January.

	The broad revolutionary workers of this factory, reviewing the great achievements of January, expressed with full confidence: we can seize power, and we can hold power; we can do a good job of revolution, and we can manage production well! In the future, we will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and strive for new victories in revolution and production!

    革命造反派掌了权　革命生产双胜利
    北京第二机床厂革命造反派职工当家后，心红胆壮，斗志昂扬，积极抓革命、促生产，一月份生产计划提前完成
    本报讯　北京第二机床厂革命职工，一月三十一日抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，扛着毛主席的四卷宝书的巨大模型，敲锣打鼓，向最敬爱的领袖毛主席报喜，报告他们夺权以后抓革命，促生产，提前完成了一月份的生产计划。这个厂的事实生动地说明：革命造反派一旦掌握了领导权，革命和生产就会出现一个崭新的局面。
    这个厂的革命造反派，经过同一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的艰苦斗争，逐步形成了一支坚强的革命造反大军，去年十一月下旬，就掌握了文化大革命运动的领导权。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心自己的失败，利用他们还掌握的生产管理权和财权，大搞反革命经济主义，腐蚀、拉拢工人，并且挑拨一部分不明真相的人离开生产岗位，到领导机关要求解决学员制度等问题，以达到他们破坏生产、破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。他们还采取“撂挑子，看笑话”的手法，抵制和破坏毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。一月份前十八天，全厂只完成全月生产任务三分之一。革命造反派职工对于党内走资本主义道路当权派的破坏万分愤慨，下决心把这些坏蛋赶下台去。“没有你们这些资产阶级老爷们，我们一定能把革命和生产干得更好！”
    一月十九日，革命造反总部联合厂里其他革命造反派组织，全面夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权。全厂政治、经济、生产管理、技术管理等大权，统统夺回到革命左派手里来了！
        为革命造反派争气
    这次夺权，大灭了资产阶级的威风，大长了无产阶级的志气。由于走资本主义道路当权派的破坏，当时生产中的确存在许多困难。但是当了家作了主的革命造反派，心红胆壮，志高气昂，迎着困难投入了战斗。一月三十一日，他们献给毛主席的报喜信中，概括地反映了他们当时的心情：
      “敬爱的毛主席，在生产任务十分艰巨的情况下，想起了您，我们就有了无比的勇气和力量。我们要坚决为您和林彪同志争气！为革命造反派争气！我们下定决心，不怕牺牲，就是上刀山，下火海，也要争取‘抓革命，促生产’的双胜利！”
    在文化大革命中一直敢打敢闯的“革命造反车间”（原第六车间），首先举行誓师大会，立下了提前三天完成任务，向毛主席报喜的雄心壮志。这个担负总装任务的车间，还抄写了毛主席的有关语录和诗词，送给另一个总装车间——“反修车间”，鼓励战友们排除万难，去争取胜利。革命造反车间的闯将们采取合理调整劳动组织等措施，充分发挥生产潜力，终于实现了自己的誓言。反修车间的革命职工面对走资本主义道路的当权派造成的零件供应延迟的困难，抢着挑重担子，也提前两天完成了生产计划。
    这个厂的革命造反派夺权以前，由于走资本主义道路的当权派彼此争名夺利，以及推行了苏修的一套管理制度，“推、拖、抹、扯”成风，各车间工人之间要互相支援也受到走资本主义道路当权派的阻拦。现在，革命职工掌权了，修正主义的制度被砸烂了，妨碍协作的障碍排除了。广大革命职工在文化大革命运动中活学活用毛主席著作，站的更高，看的更远了。他们说：完不完成生产计划，不是一个小组、一个车间的问题，而是整个工厂能否贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召的问题。完不完成生产计划，不仅是个经济问题，而且有重大政治意义。全厂革命职工，在完成一月份任务过程中，创造了许多同心协力战胜困难的动人事迹。
    过去组与组、车间与车间、工种与工种、上道工序和下道工序之间“各顾各”的现象，现在改变了。为了保证机床及时出厂，装配工人完成任务以后，就主动随着机床到喷漆工段，帮助喷漆装箱。
        新型领导班子带头冲锋陷阵
    这个厂的革命造反派夺权以后，打倒了资产阶级“官老爷”，破除了级别、资历等旧框框，从上到下建立起突出政治的新的领导班子。
    过去，工段长以上的干部全部脱产，就连工段的计划员、统计员也不参加生产。现在，参加厂一级的“生产勤务员筹备委员会”成员，大部分都不脱产。车间干部的工作，各个车间正在摸索经验，有的车间部分脱产，有的全部不脱离生产。非生产人员大大减少。干部和群众之间经常保持密切的关系。
    厂一级、车间一级的干部，统称勤务员，经常和群众滚在一起，打成一片。在夺取一月份革命、生产双胜利的斗争中，各级勤务员都带头冲锋陷阵。哪里有问题，就出现在哪里。各级勤务员由于多数原来是工人，现在大部分又不脱产，所以最了解工人，最熟悉生产，他们调兵遣将，安排工作，最符合实际。这样，便带动广大革命职工战胜了一个又一个的困难，在一月份用三分之一的时间完成了三分之二的生产任务。
    这个厂的广大革命职工回顾一月份取得的巨大成绩，满怀信心地表示：我们既能夺权，也能掌权；我们既能搞好革命，也能管理好生产！今后，我们要继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，发扬革命造反的冲天干劲，去夺取革命、生产的新胜利！
