Prince Sihanouk Reiterates that China is Cambodia's Number One Friend
Cambodia-China Friendship Can Withstand Any Storm
The Cultural Revolution Will Enable China to Further Aid Peoples' Anti-Imperialist Struggles

According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 25th — Chinese Ambassador to France, Huang Zhen, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 23rd at the embassy, inviting Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk and his wife who were staying in France. The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end.

Prince Sihanouk spoke during the toast, enthusiastically praising the friendship between Cambodia and China. He said, "China is our number one friend. This friendship, like Chinese wine, the older it gets, the more it makes one's heart bloom."

Prince Sihanouk said, "Just as the leaders of China and Cambodia have frequently pointed out, the friendship between the two countries is unbreakable. No matter what difficulties arise, no matter what events occur in the world, no matter what storms come, this friendship will never waver. It shines even brighter in the eyes of the world's people." He mentioned the words of China's great leader Chairman Mao Zedong about Cambodia-China friendship. He said he felt very honored to repeat these lofty words here.

Prince Sihanouk said, "Cambodia regards China as its sister and its best friend. I can assure you that no matter what happens, the Cambodian government and the Cambodian people will forever be the most reliable and faithful friends of the Chinese people, marching hand in hand with the Chinese people."

When talking about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Prince Sihanouk said that the Cultural Revolution was decided by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao knows best the interests of the Chinese people. China's Cultural Revolution, as Ambassador Huang just mentioned, will make China stronger and more prosperous, enabling it to better aid the Vietnamese people in defeating American imperialism, better aid the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples in overcoming American imperialism, and better aid the Asian peoples in thwarting those who threaten their sovereignty, helping them to achieve prosperity and development.

Prince Sihanouk pointed out, "This year and last year are the years when China's Cultural Revolution is underway. However, in these two years, China's aid to Cambodia in all aspects has been the most effective. China has provided military aid to Cambodia, strengthening our national defense forces, and aiding Cambodia in achieving greater victories in resisting the United States, Thailand, the Saigon puppets, and the 'Free Khmer Movement.'"

Prince Sihanouk said, "All this proves that China's policy towards Cambodia has not changed, but is developing in an even better direction. The flower of friendship is blooming more beautifully, and the fruits it bears are even better. On behalf of the Khmer people and myself, I sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese people for this."

He said, "I must also point out that China will continue to aid us. In the coming months, there will be new aid projects completed. This proves that the Cultural Revolution has given China greater potential to develop itself and to aid worthy friends."

Prince Sihanouk said, "Cambodia is following China's example, practicing self-reliance. It rejects American aid and, through its own efforts, has made the argument propagated by the United States—that countries like ours must become satellites of the United States or other imperialists to achieve independence and progress—bankrupt. Cambodia, by learning from China's example, can achieve great success in resisting imperialism while practicing self-reliance."

Prince Sihanouk concluded by wishing China greater achievements in all fields, and toasted to the health and longevity of Chairman Mao, to new victories for China, and to the unbreakable and ever-growing friendship between Cambodia and China.

Before his speech, Ambassador Huang Zhen, during the toast, enthusiastically praised Prince Sihanouk for his consistent emphasis on and efforts to consolidate and develop the friendship between the governments and peoples of China and Cambodia, praising him as one of the founders of China-Cambodia friendship. He said, "The friendship between our two peoples is a great fighting friendship, one that can withstand the test of time. Cambodia's consistent sympathy and support for the just cause of the Chinese people, we will never forget."

Ambassador Huang Zhen said, China's great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles." The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have resolved to make the greatest national sacrifices to firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American, national salvation war to the end. In the struggle of the Cambodian people against the aggression and interference of American imperialism and its lackeys, the 700 million Chinese people will, as always, firmly stand on the side of the Cambodian people and will forever be the most faithful and reliable friends of the Cambodian people.

Those attending the banquet included: Cambodian Head of State's personal advisor Bin Nu and his wife, Prince Sihanouk's daughter Princess Sorya and her husband D. Phal, Cambodian Ambassador to France Song Yuxi and his wife, other members of the prince's entourage, and diplomatic staff from the Chinese embassy.

    西哈努克亲王重申中国是柬埔寨的头号朋友 
    中柬友谊经得起任何风浪
    文化大革命将使中国能进一步支援各国人民反帝斗争
    据新华社巴黎二十五日电　中国驻法国大使黄镇，二十三日晚上在大使馆举行宴会，宴请正在法国逗留的柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王和夫人。宴会自始至终充满了热烈友好的气氛。
    西哈努克亲王在祝酒时讲话，热情地赞扬柬中两国的友谊。他说：“中国是我们的第一号朋友。”“这一友谊，象中国的美酒一样，年代愈久，愈使人心花怒放。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“正象中国领导人和柬埔寨领导人经常指出的，（中柬）两国之间的友谊是牢不可破的。不管有什么困难，不管世界上发生什么事件，有什么风浪，这一友谊始终不会动摇，它在世界人民眼中更加光辉灿烂。”他谈到中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说过的关于中柬友谊的话。他说，我在这里重复这些崇高的话感到非常荣幸。
    西哈努克亲王说：“柬埔寨把中国当作自己的姊妹，自己的最好朋友。我可以向你们保证，不管发生什么情况，柬埔寨政府和柬埔寨人民将永远是中国人民最可靠、最忠实的朋友，同中国人民手携手地一起前进。”
    西哈努克亲王在谈到中国的无产阶级文化大革命时说，中国的文化大革命是毛主席决定的。毛主席最了解中国人民的利益所在。中国的文化大革命，正如黄大使刚才说的，将使中国更强大、繁荣，使中国能更好地援助越南人民打败美帝国主义，更好地援助越南人民和柬埔寨人民压倒美帝国主义，更好地援助亚洲人民挫败威胁他们主权的人，并使他们走上繁荣和发展的道路。
    西哈努克亲王指出：“今年和去年是中国文化大革命正在进行的年头，然而在这两年里，中国对柬埔寨的各方面的援助也最有效。中国给予柬埔寨以军事援助，加强了我国国防力量，援助柬埔寨在抵抗美国、泰国、西贡傀儡和‘自由高棉运动’中取得更大的胜利。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“这些都证明了中国对柬埔寨的政策不仅未改变，而且在向更好的方向发展。友谊之花开得更好，结的果实也更好。对此，我代表高棉人民和我个人衷心地感谢毛主席和中国人民。”
    他说：“我还要指出，中国将继续援助我们。在未来几个月里，还有新的援助项目将完成。这证明，中国文化大革命使中国具有更大可能性去发展自己，和援助值得援助的朋友。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“柬埔寨正在仿效中国的榜样，实行自力更生。它拒绝美援，并通过自己的努力，使美国所宣传的为了独立和进步我们这样的国家就必须成为美国或其他帝国主义的卫星的这种论调破产。柬埔寨学习中国的榜样，在反对帝国主义的同时，实行自力更生，就可以取得很大的成就。”
    西哈努克亲王最后祝中国在各个领域取得更大成就，并为毛主席的健康长寿，为中国的新的胜利，为柬中两国牢不可破的、不断增长的友谊而干杯。
    在他讲话以前，黄镇大使在祝酒时，热烈赞扬西哈努克亲王一贯重视和努力于巩固和发展中柬两国政府和人民之间的友谊，赞扬他是中柬友谊的一位奠基人。他说，“我们两国人民之间的友谊，是伟大的战斗友谊，是经得起时间的考验的。柬埔寨王国对中国人民的正义事业一贯给予的同情和支持，我们永远不会忘记。”
    黄镇大使说，中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席早就指出：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民已下定决心，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。在柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略和干涉的斗争中，七亿中国人民也必将一如既往，坚决站在柬埔寨人民一边，将永远是柬埔寨人民最忠实、可靠的朋友。
    参加宴会的还有：柬埔寨国家元首私人顾问宾努和夫人，西哈努克亲王的女儿索丽娅公主和她的丈夫狄·法利，柬埔寨驻法国大使宋云西和夫人、亲王的其他随行人员和中国大使馆外交官员。
