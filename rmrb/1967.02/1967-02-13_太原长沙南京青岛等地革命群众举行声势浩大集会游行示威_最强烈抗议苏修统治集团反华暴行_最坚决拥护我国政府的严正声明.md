Massive rallies and protests were held in Taiyuan, Changsha, Nanjing, Qingdao, and other cities to strongly condemn the anti-China atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The protesters firmly supported the stern statement issued by our government.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's fascist atrocities have sparked strong reactions among the revolutionary rebels and masses in various parts of China. Today, revolutionary rebels and masses in Taiyuan, Changsha, Nanjing, and Qingdao held massive rallies and protest marches to vehemently condemn the Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody suppression of Chinese students in the Soviet Union, their organization of thugs to storm the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union, their infringement on Chinese sovereignty, and their savage beating of Chinese diplomatic personnel. The protesters expressed their firm support for the statement issued by our government, stating that the Soviet government must comply with all the demands outlined in the statement. They also pointed out that the crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership must be brought to account. The Soviet people, who have a glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will surely rise up to thoroughly defeat this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, seize their power, and overthrow their regime, allowing the great banner of Leninism to fly high once again in the land of the October Revolution.

In Shanxi, where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, over 30,000 revolutionary rebels and masses gathered at the "May 1st" Square in Taiyuan today. The square echoed with angry slogans condemning the Soviet revisionists. Representatives from the Shanxi Red Rebel Liaison Station and workers from the Taiyuan Textile Factory, including Red Guard leader Xie Yue, spoke at the rally. Xie Yue strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China crimes, stating that their series of atrocities violated the basic principles of international relations and fully exposed their counter-revolutionary revisionist traitor faces.

Xie Yue said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' The Soviet revisionists' frenzied opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest truth, and it further proves the immense power of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We red rebels will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, making greater contributions to the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, including the Soviet people."

After the rally, a massive protest march was held. Revolutionary rebels burned effigies of Brezhnev and Kosygin.

In Changsha, 100,000 revolutionary rebels gathered at Dongfeng Square today. Speakers at the rally pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership had committed atrocities that only the most brutal imperialist countries and the most savage fascist countries could commit, and they would not meet a good end. They said: We not only need to thoroughly uproot revisionism in our country but also, together with the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union and the revolutionary people of the world, bury modern revisionism and imperialism once and for all. After the rally, the revolutionary masses held a massive protest march.

In Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, over 50,000 revolutionary rebels and masses held rallies and protest marches. Speakers at the rally strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, stating that they are traitors to Marxism-Leninism, and their fascist atrocities are a new provocation against the Chinese people and a clear exposure of their betrayal to the American imperialists. They sternly warned the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin: The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with, and all anti-China elements will not meet a good end.

In Qingdao, 100,000 red rebels held a massive denunciation rally today. Representatives from the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee and representatives from workers', peasants', and students' revolutionary organizations spoke at the rally, warning the Soviet revisionist ruling clique that they must fully implement all the stern demands proposed by our government, with no exceptions. After the rally, a massive protest march was held, stretching for dozens of miles.

In recent days, revolutionary rebels and masses in Changchun, Baoding, and the Daqing Oil Field have also held rallies and protest marches.

    据新华社十二日讯　苏联修正主义领导集团的法西斯暴行继续在我国各地的革命造反派和革命群众中激起强烈反应。太原、长沙、南京、青岛等地的革命造反派和革命群众今天都举行了声势浩大的集会和示威游行，最最强烈抗议苏修领导集团血腥镇压我国留学生和组织暴徒闯入我驻苏大使馆，侵犯我国主权，殴打我国外交人员的野蛮暴行。示威群众表示最最坚决拥护我国政府声明，他们严正指出：中国政府声明中提出的各项要求，苏联政府必须照办。他们还指出，苏联修正主义领导集团的罪行一定要得到清算，有着十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民一定会起来把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子彻底打倒，夺他们的权，专他们的政，让伟大的列宁主义旗帜重新在十月革命的故乡高高飘扬。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大胜利的山西革命造反派和革命群众三万多人，今天在太原“五一”广场举行了集会。会场上抗议苏修的愤怒口号声此起彼伏，震撼天空。山西红色造反派联络总站的代表和太原纺织厂工人、红卫队指导员解悦等人在大会上讲了话。解悦在讲话中最强烈抗议苏修统治集团反华的罪恶活动。她说，苏修领导集团的这一系列暴行破坏了起码的国际关系准则，充分暴露了他们的反革命修正主义叛徒嘴脸。
    解悦说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”苏修疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对我国的无产阶级文化大革命，愈加证明光焰无际的毛泽东思想是最伟大的真理，愈加证明我国无产阶级文化大革命强大无比的威力。我们红色造反者，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，对包括苏联人民在内的世界人民的革命斗争作出更大贡献。
    会后举行了声势浩大的示威游行。革命造反派的战士们把勃列日涅夫和柯西金的模拟像当众处以绞刑并纵火烧毁。
    长沙的革命造反派十万人今天在东风广场举行了集会。在会上发言的人指出，苏修领导集团干出了只有最残暴的帝国主义国家和最野蛮的法西斯国家才干得出来的暴行，他们是决不会有好下场的。他们说：我们不但要在我国彻底挖掉修正主义根子，而且要和苏联革命人民一道，和全世界革命人民一道，彻底埋葬美帝国主义和现代修正主义。会后，革命群众举行了声势浩大的抗议示威游行。
    江苏省和南京市的革命造反派和革命群众五万多人举行了集会和示威游行。在会上发言的人一个又一个地对苏修统治集团表示最强烈的抗议。他们指出，苏修统治集团是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，他们的法西斯暴行是对中国人民的新挑衅，是卖身投靠美帝国主义的又一次大暴露。他们严正警告以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修领导集团：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，一切反华的人决不会有好下场。
    青岛十万红色造反者今天举行了声势浩大的声讨集会。青岛市革命造反委员会代表杨保华和工人、农民、学生革命组织的代表在大会上讲话，他们一致警告苏修统治集团：必须不折不扣地实现我国政府提出的各项严正要求，差一点也不行。会后，浩浩荡荡的红色造反者队伍，举行了绵延数十里的示威游行。
