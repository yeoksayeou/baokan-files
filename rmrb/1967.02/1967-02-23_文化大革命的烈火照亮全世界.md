"Salute to the greatest leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao!" "Salute to the greatest revolutionary mass movement in the world!" "Salute to the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries!" "Unite and make revolution!" This is the common voice of revolutionaries around the world. A Japanese friend said: "This revolutionary flame in China not only illuminates China but also lights up the hearts of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world." A friend from Ceylon pointed out, "What the Chinese people are doing in this revolution today is exactly what the proletariat of the whole world will have to do in their advance toward socialism."

All the proletarians of the world, unite! All revolutionary peoples of the world, unite! Declare war on the old world and become the masters of the new world. A massive and powerful revolutionary mass movement will surely arise throughout the world. All the demons and monsters in the world will surely be drowned in the vast ocean of revolutionary masses on the five continents!

    文化大革命的烈火照亮全世界
    “向世界人民的最伟大领袖毛主席致敬！”“向世界上最伟大的革命群众运动致敬！”“向中国无产阶级革命派致敬！”“联合起来闹革命！”这就是全世界革命者的共同心声。日本一位朋友说：中国“这一革命的火焰，不仅照红了中国，而且照亮了全世界所有被压迫人民、被压迫民族的心”。锡兰一位朋友指出，“中国人民今天在这场革命中所做的，正是全世界无产阶级将来在他们向社会主义前进时要做的。”
    全世界无产者联合起来，全世界革命人民联合起来，向旧世界宣战，做新世界的主人。一个规模巨大、威力无穷的革命群众运动定将在全世界范围内兴起。世界上一切牛鬼蛇神定将被淹没在五大洲广大革命群众的汪洋大海之中！
