A Japanese worker who studies and applies Chairman Mao's works—an inspiring story

An elderly Japanese worker named Ichikawa, who loves Chairman Mao and believes in Mao Zedong Thought, always carries a bright red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a transistor radio for listening to Beijing Radio broadcasts in his bag when he goes to and from work.

Ichikawa works as a boiler operator in a steel company. Under the harsh exploitation and oppression of the capitalists, his labor is extremely demanding. After a day's work, he is so tired that his back and legs ache, but he insists on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. Whenever he has a spare moment, he takes out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and carefully reads it, understanding the spirit of the great leader Chairman Mao's words, drawing courage and strength for the struggle from it. To ensure he can listen to Chairman Mao's teachings every day, he listens to Beijing Radio broadcasts of Chairman Mao's quotations at home in the evenings when he works the day shift, and when he works consecutive night shifts, he places the slightly old radio by the boiler and listens on time. Ichikawa says, "I listen to Chairman Mao's quotations every day as if I am starving and thirsty. This has become an indispensable part of my daily life."

Unlimited Love, Unlimited Faith

When Ichikawa talks about his feelings of unlimited love and faith in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, he says: "Chairman Mao is truly a great teacher, a great leader, a great commander, and a great helmsman. Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and built China into such a beautiful place. What Chairman Mao says are the words of the hearts of the working people, they are the principles of revolution. His words are all truths. Chairman Mao's words inspire the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations."

Through his personal experiences, Ichikawa realizes that Mao Zedong Thought is the science that guides the world's proletarian revolutionary cause to victory, and is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Therefore, he not only strives to study Mao Zedong Thought himself but also actively spreads Mao Zedong Thought by recommending the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," expanding the audience for Beijing Radio broadcasts, and developing readers for the "Beijing Weekly."

Three years ago, Ichikawa first saw a Chinese-published Japanese magazine from a friend and was overjoyed. The conversation in that issue about the great leader Chairman Mao supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and for national liberation deeply moved his heart and made him remember Chairman Mao's teachings. From then on, he became an enthusiastic reader of Chinese-published magazines such as the "Beijing Weekly." At the same time, he thought that to let more people study Mao Zedong Thought and understand the tremendous changes that have taken place in China under Chairman Mao's leadership, and to further promote the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, he should not just read these magazines himself but should also actively promote them to spread the seeds of truth. To expand the subscriber base, he seized every opportunity to propagate. He not only did this in the factory but also used his spare time to visit residents door-to-door, propagating revolutionary principles and awakening their consciousness. Sometimes, because the other person's work only allows them to be free on Sundays, he would sacrifice his own rest time to do the subscription work.

Overcoming All Difficulties to Spread the Truth

What force drives Ichikawa to bravely sacrifice his personal interests, fearlessly face countless difficulties, and selflessly struggle to spread the truth of Mao Zedong Thought? It is the great thoughts shining in Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Ichikawa often uses the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to strictly demand of himself. Ichikawa says that to truly achieve "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, one must not only struggle against class enemies but also wage a tenacious struggle against the "self" in one's own thoughts.

Last summer, one afternoon, Ichikawa, in order to expand the readership, was running around everywhere. Under the scorching sun, he felt really tired and sat down to rest in the shade of a tree, thinking, "I'll stop today." But he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we shall strive for victory." He thought of the thrilling and great struggle of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's 25,000-li Long March, and he instantly became invigorated, his spirit soaring, and he was inspired with the high morale to overcome difficulties and continue forward. Ichikawa said that the spirit of Norman Bethune, who was selfless and dedicated to the people, and his internationalism are what I should learn well. For Chairman Mao's books, one must learn a bit, use a bit, and not practicing is as good as not learning.

Being Opposed by the Enemy is a Good Thing

Ichikawa's active promotion of Chinese publications and propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought has caused the factory management to be terrified. Some time ago, the management transferred him from the repair workshop, where there were many people, to the boiler room, where he worked alone, attempting to cut off his contact with the masses and obstruct his propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought. Not only that, as more and more Japanese people study and apply the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a small handful of Japanese revisionists are also terrified and do their utmost to obstruct and restrict the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. They used all sorts of despicable tricks against Ichikawa. However, all of these, Ichikawa is fearless, firmly believing in Chairman Mao's teachings: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Ichikawa said that the working class cannot do things that make the enemy happy and pleased. Therefore, we must clarify who our enemies are and who our friends are. He said that if anyone compromises with the revisionists, they are compromising with the enemy, they are compromising with American imperialism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not voluntarily disappear." They "will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history," so we must not harbor any illusions about the enemy. The Japanese people can only gain liberation through their own struggles. Although our struggles are arduous, I am convinced that with Mao Zedong Thought, our struggles will definitely be victorious.

    做毛泽东思想的宣传员
    ——一位日本工人活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹
    无限热爱毛主席、无限信仰毛泽东思想的日本老工人市川，上下班时提的布包里，总是装着一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》和一台专为收听北京电台广播用的半导体收音机。
    市川是一家钢铁公司的烧锅炉的工人。在资本家的残酷剥削和压榨下，劳动极为繁重，他干完一天活，累得腰酸腿疼，但他坚持每天学习毛主席著作。他一有空就拿出《毛主席语录》精心阅读，领会伟大领袖毛主席的话的精神，从中汲取斗争的勇气和力量。他为了每天都能够听到毛主席的教导，上白班时，坚持晚间在家里收听北京电台广播的毛主席语录，遇到连续上夜班时，就把那台半旧的收音机放到锅炉旁，按时收听。市川说：“我每天都如饥似渴地收听毛主席语录，这已成为我每天不可缺少的生活内容了。”
    无限热爱，无限信仰
    市川在谈到他对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰的心情时说：“毛主席真正是一位伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手。毛主席领导中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，把中国建设得这样美好。毛主席说的都是我们劳动人民心里的话，都是革命的道理。他的话句句是真理。毛主席的话，鼓舞着被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争。”
    市川通过他的切身体会，认识到毛泽东思想是指导全世界无产阶级革命事业走向胜利的科学，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，因此他不仅自己努力学习毛泽东思想，而且通过向人们推荐《毛主席语录》、扩大北京电台广播听众、发展《北京周报》读者等活动，积极传播毛泽东思想。
    三年前，市川在朋友那里第一次看到一本中国出版的日文杂志，他高兴极了。那一期杂志上刊登的伟大领袖毛主席支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话，强烈地打动了他的心弦，使他念念不忘毛主席的教导。从那时起，他就成为中国出版的《北京周报》等刊物的热心读者。同时他还想，为了能让更多的人学习毛泽东思想，了解在毛主席领导下发生了翻天覆地的变化的中国情况，为了进一步促进日中两国人民的战斗友谊，不能仅限于自己看这些刊物，还应当积极加以推广，以便广泛撒播真理的种子。为了扩大订户，他抓住一切机会，逢人就宣传。他不仅在工厂里，而且还利用业余时间到居民中挨门逐户访问，宣传革命道理，启发对方的觉悟。有时由于对方平日工作只有星期天空闲，他便牺牲自己的休息时间，去做征订工作。
    排除万难，传播真理
    是什么力量促使市川勇于牺牲个人利益，不怕重重困难，为了传播毛泽东思想的真理而忘我地进行斗争呢？是毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》这三篇光辉著作中闪烁着的伟大思想。市川自己经常用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神严格要求自己。市川说，真正做到“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，不仅要同阶级敌人进行斗争，还要同自己思想里的“私”字做顽强的斗争。
    去年夏天的一个下午，市川为了扩大读者，四处奔走。在炎日暴晒下，他感到实在是走累了，便在树荫下乘凉，心想：“今天就算了吧！”但是他马上想起了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”想起了中国工农红军二万五千里长征的惊心动魄的伟大斗争场面，他顿时振奋起来，精神抖擞，鼓舞起克服困难的高昂斗志，继续前进。市川说，白求恩的毫不利己专门利人的精神和他的国际主义精神，是我应当很好学习的。对于毛主席的书必须学一点，用一点，不实践等于没有学。
    被敌人反对是好事
    市川积极推广中国书刊、宣传毛泽东思想的革命行动，引起了厂方的恐惧。前些时候，厂方把他从群众较多的修理车间调到只有他一个人工作的锅炉房，企图切断他同群众的联系，阻挠他宣传毛泽东思想。不仅如此，随着越来越多的日本人民学习和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一小撮日本修正主义分子也怕得要死，百般阻挠和限制毛泽东思想的传播。他们对市川施展了种种卑鄙的伎俩。但是，所有这些，市川毫不畏惧，坚信毛主席的教导：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。市川说，我们工人阶级不能做使敌人欢迎和高兴的事。因此，必须弄清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。他说，谁如果同修正主义分子妥协，谁就是同敌人妥协，就是同美帝国主义妥协。毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”他们“都不会自行退出历史舞台”，因此，对敌人绝不能抱任何幻想。日本人民只有通过自己的斗争，才能获得解放。尽管我们的斗争很艰苦，但我确信，有了毛泽东思想，我们的斗争一定会取得胜利。　　（据新华社东京二十六日电）
