Communist Party members must not detach themselves from the majority of the masses, ignore the situation of the majority, and lead a small number of advanced forces to advance alone; they must pay attention to organizing close ties between advanced elements and the broad masses. This is the viewpoint of considering the majority.

Do Thorough Ideological Work to Unite the Majority

Beijing Hongqi Printing Factory

The revolutionary rebels of Beijing Hongqi Printing Factory, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity - criticism - unity," have conducted thorough and meticulous ideological work on those masses who were deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and on cadres who made general mistakes. This is an important prerequisite for winning over and uniting the majority. Without such painstaking ideological work, uniting the majority will become an empty slogan. Revolutionary rebels in all units should pay great attention to this work, using Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, to warmly and patiently help those who were deceived and made mistakes to draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois reactionary line, recognize the revolutionary direction, and fight against those in power who are taking the capitalist road. Only in this way can we form a vast revolutionary army and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Break with Selfishness for the Revolution

In the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, we revolutionary rebels of Hongqi Printing Factory, in response to Chairman Mao's great call, have seized power from a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road. We have won. However, while seizing power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road, we must also seize the power of the "self" in our minds and set up the battle lines in our minds for the proletariat to seize power from the bourgeoisie. Only by achieving the revolutionization of people's thinking, using the proletariat's "public" to seize the positions of the bourgeoisie's "self" in our minds, can we remain humble in victory and unyielding in defeat, and can we firmly hold onto the power we have seized.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because of victory, the emotions of arrogance within the Party, the emotion of considering oneself a hero, the emotion of stopping progress, and the emotion of seeking pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life may grow."

In the process of our victory and after seizing power, some comrades began to show signs of "swollen heads" and the thought of "I am the most revolutionary." This is clearly manifested in their cold mockery, disdain, and even labeling those who speak a few words to these people as "conciliators" and "compromisers," seriously hindering the unity between the revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses. In response to this situation, we timely studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and the editorial of the third issue of the Red Flag magazine, summarized experiences, drew lessons, and firmly grasped the direction of the movement.

Uniting the Majority is a Revolutionary Need

Chairman Mao said: "The attitude of Communist Party members towards backward people is not to look down on them, despise them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." Based on the great leader's teaching, we actively sought out those comrades who had a vague understanding of the proletarian cultural revolution, had heart-to-heart talks, shared situations, and explained policies. These comrades quickly awakened, resulting in a leap in their understanding and actions. Not only did they boldly expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, but many comrades also took big steps into the ranks of the revolutionary rebels.

We revolutionary rebel workers firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must not only unite with those who agree with us but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us. We must also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." For those who were deceived and are now dissolved in the "conservative" organizations, we conducted a thorough class analysis and believed that the vast majority of comrades have deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. They are also revolutionary. However, due to the instigation of a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, they did not recognize the situation, or had too many selfish thoughts and concerns, and thus took a detour. We should not discriminate against them, nor should we adopt an hostile attitude towards them. We should actively and proactively persuade them, help them, and encourage them to advance.

To unite the majority and make a revolution together, after seizing power, we actively convened meetings with those who were deceived, or conducted individual visits, listened to their opinions, studied their demands, and solved their problems. At the same time, we studied the Party's relevant policies with them. This effectively promoted the unification of our understanding on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. They firmly expressed their willingness to return to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, daring to stand up and expose the schemes of a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the Party and those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line to sabotage the cultural revolution. After a driver comrade exposed how those in power who are taking the capitalist road intentionally obstructed the revolutionary rebels from using their spare time to make revolutionary connections and ordered him to sabotage the car, it aroused great indignation among the broad revolutionary masses. A large number of living facts made everyone realize that revolutionary workers are all on the same vine, and they should unite to expose, accuse, and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, seize the revolution, and promote production.

Correctly Identify and Differentiate Treatment of Cadres

In dealing with cadres, we should also use the method of class analysis to identify and differentiate them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres. We must not only look at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance, but also look at the cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." The proletarian cultural revolution focuses on criticizing those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and we absolutely should not indiscriminately overthrow all cadres. This requires us to analyze, examine, and appraise each cadre to see if they truly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and work with the revolutionary rebels. Under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, many cadres have too many "frameworks" and are dominated by the word "fear." Because they have a thousand and one connections with those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they often cannot shake off the constraints of "old habits" and the influence of "self," and thus hesitate to move, putting themselves in a passive position of being beaten. For those among them who are willing to correct their mistakes, we follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "A good Communist Party member must be good at considering the overall situation, good at considering the majority, and good at working with allies." We follow the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity - criticism - unity," actively doing the work of cadres. For work-related issues, we discuss with them, respect their opinions, encourage them to take responsibility, and fully mobilize their enthusiasm. For their selfish thoughts, we use individual talks and class views to enlighten and educate them, making them realize that as long as they dare to stand up and boldly join the revolutionary masses, they will gain the understanding and trust of the revolutionary rebels. Through patient and meticulous work, the thoughts of the cadres were finally dispelled, and the vast majority of cadres stood up. Some even joined the revolutionary rebel organizations.

Those who were deceived (including cadres) know best the crimes of a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They rise up in revolution and boldly expose, which can make more people further see through the ugly faces of a handful of bad guys and further recognize the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by uniting all possible forces can we thoroughly destroy the mass base of a handful of bad guys' counter-revolutionary seizure of power and consolidate the power we revolutionary rebels have seized.

We revolutionary rebels were born in the storm and grew up in the waves. Although we were originally in the minority, because we paid attention to doing painstaking work to unite the majority, our forces quickly grew and strengthened.

Raise Revolutionary Alertness and Fight the Fallen Enemy

Currently, although we have achieved some results, this is only the beginning of the new stage of the proletarian cultural revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat, and they will make their last struggle." That handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and those stubborn elements who cling to the bourgeois reactionary line are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and they are still struggling like cornered beasts, trying to seize power back from our revolutionary rebels. There are also some jumping jacks who are typical bourgeois two-faced people. In the face of the trend, they appear in an ultra-leftist guise, attempting to sneak into our revolutionary rebel ranks. They are like horse dung covered with frost on the road in winter, inside and out are not the same. Once they see an opportunity, they will spread cold winds, ignite evil fires, spread rumors, look for their spokesmen in the revolutionary rebel ranks to cooperate with the counterattack of a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and launch an inside-outside attack to collapse our leftist camp and realize their wolfish ambitions. We revolutionary rebels must raise our revolutionary alertness, unite the majority of revolutionary masses, and at any time uncover the tricks of the class enemy's counter-revolutionary seizure of power, placing them in the sky-net and earth-net of the great alliance of revolutionaries, leaving them no place to hide. We must "sweep away all harmful insects!"

### 做好深入细致的思想工作团结大多数

专栏：

    共产党员决不可脱离群众的多数，置多数人的情况于不顾，而率领少数先进队伍单独冒进；必须注意组织先进分子和广大群众之间的密切联系。这就是照顾多数的观点。
    做好深入细致的思想工作团结大多数
    北京红旗印刷二厂红旗公社
    北京红旗印刷二厂的革命造反派，遵照毛主席指示的“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，对那些受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众和犯有一般错误的干部，进行了深入细致的思想工作。这是争取和团结大多数的重要前提。不经过这样艰苦的思想工作，团结大多数就会变成一句空话。各个单位的革命造反派，都应该十分重视这项工作，运用毛泽东思想这一强大武器，热情、耐心地帮助受蒙蔽和犯错误的同志同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，认清革命的大方向，狠斗走资本主义道路的当权派。只有这样，才能组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
                              ——编者
    破私立公为革命
    在无产阶级和资产阶级的殊死搏斗中，我们红旗印刷二厂的革命造反派职工，响应毛主席的伟大号召，夺了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。我们胜利了。但是，在向走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，也要夺我们头脑中“私”字的权，在头脑里把无产阶级向资产阶级夺权的阵势摆开。只有实现人的思想革命化，用无产阶级的“公”字，把自己头脑里资产阶级“私”字的阵地夺过来，才能胜不骄，败不馁，才能把夺过来的权，牢牢地掌握起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”
    我们在胜利前进之时和夺权以后，在某些同志当中，“翘尾巴”、“唯我最革命”的思想就开始露头。这明显地表现在对待那些被资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽过的人，以及有些对文化大革命还不理解、不热心的人，冷嘲热讽，看不顺眼，甚至看到自己队伍中有谁跟这些人说几句话，立刻就给戴上“调和”、“折衷”的帽子，严重妨碍了革命造反派职工同广大革命群众的团结。针对这种情况，我们及时地学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，和《红旗》杂志第三期社论，总结经验，吸取教训，牢牢掌握住运动的大方向。
    团结大多数是革命的需要
    毛主席说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”根据伟大领袖的这一教导，我们主动找那些对无产阶级文化大革命认识不清的同志，谈心互助，摆情况，讲政策。这些同志很快觉醒过来，从而产生了一个认识上和行动上的飞跃，不但起来大胆揭发批判资产阶级反动路线，而且有不少同志大步踏进革命造反派的行列中来。
    我们革命造反派职工牢记毛主席的教导：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”对于原来反对过我们，现在已经解散了的保字派组织中受蒙蔽的人，我们认真地进行了阶级分析，认为他们之中绝大多数同志对党、对毛主席同样有深厚的阶级感情，他们也是要革命的。但是，由于他们受了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑动，认不清形势，或者私心杂念较重，顾虑较多，因此走了一段弯路。对待他们既不能歧视，更不能采取敌对态度，要积极主动地去说服他们，帮助他们，鼓励他们前进。
    为了团结大多数，一道闹革命，在夺权后，我们主动召集受蒙蔽的同志开座谈会，或进行个别访问，听取他们的意见，研究他们的要求，解决他们的问题。同时和他们共同学习党的有关方针政策。这就有力地促进了彼此之间在毛泽东思想基础上统一认识。他们坚决表示要回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来，勇于站出来揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子破坏文化大革命的阴谋诡计。一位司机同志把走资本主义道路的当权派如何蓄意阻止革命造反派利用业余时间进行革命串连，指使他破坏汽车的反革命罪行揭发出来以后，引起了广大革命群众的极大愤慨。大量活生生的事实，使大家认识到，革命工人都是一棵藤上的苦瓜，完全应该团结在一起，共同揭发、控诉、批判资产阶级反动路线，抓革命，促生产。
    正确识别和区别对待干部
    对待干部，也应该用阶级分析的方法来识别他们，区别对待他们。毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”无产阶级文化大革命，重点是整那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，而绝不能把所有干部不分青红皂白地通通打倒。这就需要对每一个干部进行分析、考察和鉴定，看他们是不是真正站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同革命造反派一起干革命。在资产阶级反动路线的影响下，很多干部“框框”多，“怕”字当头，又因为和党内走资本主义道路当权派有着千丝万缕的联系，往往既摆脱不了“旧习惯”的束缚，又摆脱不了“私”字的作祟，因而迟迟不动，把自己置于被动挨打的地位。对于他们当中愿意改正错误的人，我们遵照毛主席的教导：“一个好的共产党员，必须善于照顾全局，善于照顾多数，并善于和同盟者一道工作。”我们遵循“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，主动地去做干部的工作。对于工作上的问题，我们和他们共同商量，尊重他们的意见，鼓励他们大胆负责，充分调动他们的积极性。对于他们的私心杂念，则通过个别交谈，用阶级观点去启发教育他们，使他们认识到，只要敢于挺起腰杆，大胆地走到革命群众一起来，就会得到革命造反派的谅解，取得信任。经过耐心细致的工作，干部中的思想顾虑终于消除了，绝大多数干部站出来了。有的还参加了革命造反派的组织。
    受蒙蔽的同志（包括干部在内）最了解那一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的罪恶，他们起来革命，大胆揭发，才能使更多的群众进一步识破那一小撮坏家伙的丑恶嘴脸，进一步认清资产阶级反动路线的实质。只有团结一切可以团结的力量，才能彻底摧毁一小撮坏家伙反夺权的群众基础，才能巩固我们革命造反派夺来的权。
    我们革命造反派是在暴风雨中生，在大风大浪中长。尽管我们原来是少数，但由于我们注意了做艰苦细致的团结大多数的工作，使我们的队伍迅速地成长和壮大起来。
    提高革命警惕性，狠打落水狗
    当前，我们虽然取得了一点成绩，但这仅仅是无产阶级文化大革命新阶段的开始。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及死抱住资产阶级反动路线不放的顽固分子，他们人还在，心不死，困兽犹斗，还企图从我们革命造反派手中反夺权。还有那么一些跳梁小丑，他们是典型的资产阶级两面派。在大势所趋的情况下，他们以极“左”的面目出现，妄图钻进我们革命造反派队伍里来。他们就象冬天马路上沾有白霜的驴粪蛋，表里不一，一旦有机可乘，就刮阴风，点邪火，造谣言，在革命造反派队伍中寻找他们的代言人，以配合一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的新反扑，来个里应外合，内外夹攻，搞垮我们左派阵营，实现他们的狼子野心。我们革命造反派必须提高革命警惕性，团结大多数的革命群众，随时识破阶级敌人反夺权的一切阴谋诡计，将他们置于革命派大联合的天罗地网之中，使他们无藏身之处。我们一定“要扫除一切害人虫”！
