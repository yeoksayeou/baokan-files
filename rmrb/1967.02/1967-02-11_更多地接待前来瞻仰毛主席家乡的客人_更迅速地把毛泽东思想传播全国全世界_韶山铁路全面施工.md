A railway connecting Changsha to the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao—Shaoshan Railway—has recently started full-scale construction. This is a great joy for the people of the entire nation.

Over the past 18 years since the founding of the country, countless international friends, filled with boundless love and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, have come from all corners of the world to visit Chairman Mao's hometown. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thousands upon thousands of Red Guards from all over the country come daily to pay homage to the place where the sun of our hearts, the reddest sun, rose.

Shaoshan has become a great school for domestic and international revolutionary people to study Mao Zedong Thought. To better receive visitors coming to pay homage to Chairman Mao's hometown and to more swiftly, extensively, and deeply spread Mao Zedong Thought across the nation and the world, the Red Guards of Changsha Railway Institute proposed the construction of the Shaoshan Railway. This proposal immediately received the support of the Party Central Committee and the broad revolutionary masses. On November 15th of last year, revolutionary workers from the Hunan Provincial Communications Department, Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from Changsha Railway Institute and Lanzhou Railway First Middle School formed the Shaoshan Railway Survey Vanguard Company and set out for the construction site. They studied Chairman Mao's works diligently on the construction site and, with a spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and rebel, broke through many of the bourgeois "authorities'" rules and regulations. In just two months, they surveyed five routes. After comparison, they selected the most economical and reasonable route (connecting from Matoupu on the Changsha-Shaoyang Railway line, passing through Shaodong to Shaoshan).

On January 25th of this year, the full-scale construction of this 21-kilometer-long Shaoshan Railway began. The broad masses of workers and peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary teachers and students participated in the construction labor and site propaganda work. With boundless love for the great leader, they felt honored to contribute their strength and sweat to this railway leading to Chairman Mao's hometown. Revolutionary rebel groups from various units united to seize the leadership of the project and established the Shaoshan Railway Revolutionary Production Committee. They actively implemented Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and are determined to build this railway to the highest standards, with the least cost, the best quality, and the shortest construction time.

    更多地接待前来瞻仰毛主席家乡的客人
    更迅速地把毛泽东思想传播全国全世界
    韶山铁路全面施工
    新华社长沙十日电　一条由长沙通往我们伟大领袖毛主席家乡的铁路——韶山铁路最近全面施工。这是全国人民的大喜事。
    建国十八年来，无数国际友人怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱和无限敬仰的心情，从全世界各个国家和地区，不远万里，远渡重洋，前来访问毛主席的家乡。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，每天都有成千上万的红卫兵小将从全国各地来瞻仰我们心中最红最红的红太阳升起的地方。
    韶山成了国内外广大革命人民学习毛泽东思想的大学校。为了更多、更好地接待前来瞻仰毛主席家乡的客人，更迅速、更广泛、更深入地把毛泽东思想传播到全国和全世界，长沙铁道学院的红卫兵提出了修建韶山铁路的倡议，这个倡议，立即得到了党中央和广大革命造反派群众的支持。去年十一月十五日，湖南省交通厅的革命工人、长沙铁道学院和兰州铁路一中的红卫兵和革命师生员工，组成了韶山铁路勘测尖兵连，开赴工地。他们在工地活学活用毛主席著作，并且发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢造反的精神，打破资产阶级“权威”的许多条条框框，在两个月时间内，勘测出五条线路。经过比较，选定了其中比较经济合理的一条线路（由长沙—邵阳铁路线上的马托铺接轨，经韶东到韶山）。
    今年一月二十五日，这条全长二十一公里的韶山铁路开始全面施工。广大工农群众、红卫兵和革命师生参加了施工劳动和工地宣传鼓动工作。他们怀着对伟大领袖的无限热爱，以能为这条通往毛主席家乡的铁路出一把力、流一滴汗而感到光荣。各单位参加施工的革命造反派联合起来，夺了工程的领导权，成立了韶山铁路革命生产委员会，他们积极贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，决心把这条铁路修成标准最高、用钱最少、质量最好、施工时间最短的铁路。
