Soviet revisionist leaders are brazenly anti-China while fawning over the US Empire. Khrushchev to London to collude with Wilson in peddling the "peace talks" scam.

LONDON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) — One of the main leaders of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, arrived in London today with a large entourage to hold a series of secret talks with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who serves the global strategy of US imperialism. Kosygin's visit comes at a time when the Soviet revisionist leadership is hastening to curry favor with US imperialism and further betray the interests of the peoples of the world in revolution.

Upon arriving at London Airport, Kosygin hurriedly declared that he had come to betray the interests of the peoples of the world in revolution. He described the current situation of the world people's revolutionary struggle as a "very serious stage" and, in tune with the American rulers, vigorously advocated the need for "relaxation." He fawned over British Prime Minister Wilson, who came to greet him, and expressed the hope that Britain would "carry on" its "tradition" of "active participation in diplomatic affairs" and "play an active role in solving some urgent problems." Observers in London generally believe that this amounts to encouraging Britain to add fuel to the fire of the US "peace talks" scam on the Vietnam issue.

After arriving, Kosygin immediately held a secret talk with Wilson. The talk lasted three hours, much longer than the originally scheduled time, and at one point only the two of them and an interpreter were present. It is reported that the Vietnam issue was the main topic of the talks; Wilson appealed to Kosygin to "cooperate" with the US and Britain in the "peace talks" scam.

It is reported that one of the important "tasks" of Kosygin's visit to London is to help US imperialism play a counter-revolutionary trick to induce the Vietnamese people to surrender to the American aggressors, so that the US imperialism, which is floundering in the vast ocean of the Vietnamese people's war, can avoid being wiped out. It is noteworthy that Kosygin arrived in London at a time when the US and its lackeys were using the "ceasefire" during the Vietnamese New Year to hype up the "peace talks" plot. Western newspapers have recently been discussing the fact that the Soviet leadership is now "more eager than ever before" for the fighting in Vietnam to stop. The Washington correspondent of the British "Observer" said that some "secret reports" from Moscow to Washington "indicate that the Kremlin is now ready to reconcile with the United States," and that "both sides know that the price of any such reconciliation must be the settlement of the Vietnam conflict."

Another important "task" of Kosygin's visit is to plot with US imperialism and its lackeys to expand and accelerate counter-revolutionary collusion, in an attempt to speed up the formation of a new "Holy Alliance" to resist the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, which is shaking the world, and to resist the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible in battle. Because the imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries are very afraid that the people of various countries will rise up against them under this influence, seize power from them, and build a brilliant new world. The British "Daily Mirror" mentioned this point on the 6th and said that what is happening in China now "is the most important thing of this century for the West and for the Kremlin"; and that "Kosygin is as worried about this as we are."

It is reported that Kosygin will also discuss with the US and Britain the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation" and "relaxation of the European situation" and further collude with them.

Kosygin will stay in Britain for eight days. This time, he followed the example of Khrushchev's visit to London 11 years ago, bringing his daughter and grandson with him.

    苏修头目一面猖狂反华一面讨好美帝
    柯西金到伦敦同威尔逊合伙推销和谈骗局
    据新华社伦敦六日电  苏联修正主义领导集团的主要头目之一、苏联部长会议主席柯西金，带着一大批随从，六日到达伦敦，前来同替为美帝国主义的侵略性全球战略效劳的英国工党政府首相威尔逊举行一系列秘密会谈。
    柯西金是在苏联修正主义领导集团加紧投靠美帝国主义和进一步出卖世界革命人民利益的时刻，前来伦敦的。这次访问是美苏共谋反华、反共、反革命、反人民的全球性大阴谋的一个重要组成部分。
    柯西金一到伦敦机场，就慌忙表白他是专为出卖世界人民革命利益而来的。他把目前世界人民革命斗争的一派大好形势说成什么“国际局势正处在一个十分严重的阶段”，并且同美国统治者唱一个调子，竭力鼓吹急需“缓和”。他媚态十足地称颂前来迎接他的英国首相威尔逊，并且期望英国“发扬”“积极参与外交事务”的“传统”，“能在解决若干迫切的问题中起积极作用”。在伦敦的观察家普遍认为，这等于鼓励英国为美国贩卖在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局再加一把力。
    柯西金到达后，立即同威尔逊密谈。会谈长达三小时，远比原订时间长得多，其中有一段时间只有他们两人和译员参加。据透露，越南问题是会谈的首要议题；威尔逊曾向柯西金呼吁，要他在“和谈”骗局上同美英“合作”。
    据透露，柯西金这次伦敦之行的一个重要“任务”，是帮助美帝国主义玩弄反革命两手，来诱迫越南人民向美国侵略者投降，使浮沉于越南人民战争的汪洋大海之中的美帝国主义免遭灭顶之灾。值得注意的是：柯西金正是在美国和它的仆从利用越南战场上春节“停火”大搞“和谈”阴谋的时候，前来伦敦的。西方报纸最近纷纷谈论苏联领导集团现在“比过去任何时候都更加热望（越南）那里的战斗停止”。英国《观察家报》驻华盛顿记者说，从莫斯科到达华盛顿的一些“机密报告”，“表明克里姆林宫现在准备同美国和解”，而“双方知道任何这类和解的代价必须是解决越南冲突”。
    柯西金此行的另一个重要“任务”，是策划同美帝国主义及其仆从扩大并加速反革命勾结，妄图加速拼凑一个新“神圣同盟”，来抵制震动全世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，抵制战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大影响，因为帝国主义者、修正主义者和一切反动派都十分害怕各国人民将在这种影响下起来造他们的反，夺他们的权，建立起一个光辉灿烂的新世界。英国《每日镜报》六日谈到这一点时说，目前中国所发生的事情，“对西方和对克里姆林宫说来，都是这个世纪最重大的事情”；对此，“柯西金同我们一样感到不安”。
    据透露，柯西金在伦敦还准备就所谓防止“核扩散”和“缓和欧洲局势”等问题，同美、英进一步勾结。
    柯西金将在英国逗留八天，他这次到英国活动还仿效了赫鲁晓夫十一年前访问伦敦的榜样，带来了他的女儿和外孙等人。
