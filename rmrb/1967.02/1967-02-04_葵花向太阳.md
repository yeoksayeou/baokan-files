Sunflowers Face the Sun

The sun, Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong, the sun!

One noon, Chinese experts working at the "Lightning" match factory in Bamako were returning home after work. As they walked out of the factory gate, an elderly Malian man who had been waiting there for a long time approached them and shook the hand of a Chinese comrade, saying, "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader we Malian people deeply respect. It is he who sent you, such good experts, to build factory after factory for us Malians." He paused briefly and then said sincerely, "I am old and do not hope for much, but I only hope that you can give me a Chairman Mao badge so that I can look at my most respected Chairman Mao more often!" The Chinese experts fulfilled his wish and immediately gave him a shiny Chairman Mao badge. The old man held the Chairman Mao badge in his hands, his eyes fixed on Chairman Mao's image, and excitedly shouted, "Mao Zedong, the sun! Mao Zedong, the sun!" (In Bambara, "sun" is called "trey.")

"I am a person of Chairman Mao"

A Chinese comrade was walking down a street in Havana when a truck suddenly stopped by the roadside. Someone inside the truck extended a hand, waving and shouting, "Great Chairman Mao!" The driver of the truck was a middle-aged Cuban friend who was waiting to speak to the Chinese comrade.

"Are you people from Chairman Mao?" he said warmly, looking at the Chairman Mao badge pinned to the Chinese comrade's chest. "I am also a person of Chairman Mao, I stand on Chairman Mao's side."

He told the Chinese comrade that he was a Cuban worker. He said he supported Chairman Mao's correct line and had boundless love for Chairman Mao. He said, "Whenever I see his portrait, I take off my hat to pay my respects."

Heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao

"Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world!" This is a sentence that the revolutionary people of Mauritania often say to Chinese friends. The revolutionary people of Mauritania regard Chairman Mao as the red sun in their hearts, and they express their boundless respect and love for Chairman Mao in various ways on various occasions.

Last year, a Chinese folk art troupe visited Mauritania and performed. The exquisite Chinese folk art, especially the revolutionary content of each performance, deeply moved the audience. Many people, after watching the performance, specially went to the artists' residence to express their thanks. They congratulated Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line on its victory and thanked Chairman Mao for sending them new art full of educational significance! By the last two performances, some young students thought of a way to express their boundless love for Chairman Mao: they tore their exercise books into single pages and made countless leaflets with "Long live Chairman Mao" written on them, which they scattered in the performance hall. The audience, after seeing these leaflets, all happily said that this was exactly what they wanted to express.

    葵花向太阳
    太阳，毛泽东！毛泽东，太阳！
    一天中午，在巴马科“闪电”火柴厂工作的中国专家下班回家。正当他们走出工厂大门的时候，一位在厂门口等候了好久的马里老人迎上前去，紧紧地握住一位中国同志的手说：“毛主席是我们马里人民心中最敬仰的伟大领袖，是他派来了你们这样好的专家，为我们马里人建设了一座又一座的工厂。”他说到这里稍微停了一下，然后十分诚恳地说：“我年纪大了，不再希望什么，只求你们给我一枚毛主席像章，让我能多看几眼我最敬仰的毛主席！”中国专家满足了他的要求，立即赠给他一枚闪闪发光的毛主席像章。老人把这枚毛主席像章捧在手里，两眼盯住毛主席像，兴奋地喊着“毛泽东，特雷！毛泽东，特雷！”（在邦巴拉语中“特雷”是“太阳”的意思。）
    “我是毛主席的人”
    一位中国同志正在哈瓦那的一条大街上行走，迎面而来的一辆卡车突然在路旁煞住，有人从车里伸出手来，向他摆动，高呼：“伟大的毛主席！”驾驶这辆卡车的是一位中年的古巴朋友，他正等着向中国同志说话。
    “你们是毛主席那里来的人吧？”他亲切地注视着中国同志胸前别着的毛主席像章说：“我也是属于毛主席的人，我站在毛主席这一边。”
    他告诉中国同志，他是一位古巴工人。他说，他支持毛主席的正确路线，对毛主席怀着无限的热爱。他说：“我一看到他老人家的像，就脱帽致敬。”
    衷心感谢毛主席
    “毛泽东不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是全世界一切革命人民的伟大领袖！”这是毛里塔尼亚的革命人民经常向中国朋友说的一句话。毛里塔尼亚革命人民把毛主席看作他们心中的红太阳，他们在各种场合用各种方式来表达对毛主席的无限崇敬和热爱。
    中国民间艺术团去年到毛里塔尼亚访问演出，带去的精湛的中国民间艺术，特别是各个节目的革命内容使观众深受感动。不少人在看了演出后专门赶到艺术团住处表示感谢。他们祝贺毛主席的革命文艺路线的胜利，感谢毛主席给他们送来的富有教育意义的新艺术！到最后两场演出时，一些青年学生想出了一个表达他们无限敬爱毛主席的感情的办法：把他们的作业练习本拆成单页，制作了许许多多写着“毛主席万岁”的传单，散发在演出大厅里。观众们看到了这些传单后，都高兴地说这正好表达了他们的心声。
