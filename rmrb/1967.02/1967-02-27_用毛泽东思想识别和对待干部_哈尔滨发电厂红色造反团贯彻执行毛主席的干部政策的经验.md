The Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Power Plant, in the struggle for great alliance and seizure of power, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. According to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, they mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to identify cadres using Mao Zedong Thought, educate cadres, and emphasize the role of revolutionary cadres in the seizure of power. They supported and relied on cadres who stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; they united with cadres who had made mistakes but were willing to revolutionize and had shown some progress; they isolated and struck at a handful of cadres who were taking the capitalist road, thus ensuring the victory of the seizure of power and the consolidation and development of the achievements of the seizure of power.

(1) Resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, treating different types of cadres differently, relying on cadres who stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; uniting with cadres who have made mistakes but are willing to revolutionize and have shown some progress; resolutely striking at a handful of cadres within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The editorial in the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine also points out: "The role of revolutionary cadres in the struggle for seizure of power must be sufficiently emphasized." The Red Rebels of the Harbin Power Plant, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, used the method of class analysis in the struggle for seizure of power to identify and deal with cadres, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and treating different types of cadres differently.

For cadres who stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they are resolutely trusted, supported, and relied upon. Li Zirong, the former shift supervisor of the plant's operation department (equivalent to the workshop director), firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As early as last August, when the Red Rebels just formed their organization, he joined the ranks of the Red Rebels. Despite the threat of being labeled a "traitor to the party," he resolutely rebelled. In the series of major struggles against a handful of cadres within the party who were taking the capitalist road, against the "Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee," a tool of the plant party committee to implement the bourgeois reactionary line, against the dissolution of conservative organizations, and against the seizure of power by the Red Rebels throughout the plant, Li Zirong stood firmly with all the Red Rebels, charging into the fray. Therefore, after the seizure of power, he was elected to the plant's production leadership core—the "Production Supervision Committee." On February 8, the old production team was thoroughly reorganized, and he was again elected to the factory's production service group. In addition, the plant's Red Rebels also fully trusted and resolutely relied on those cadres who, although made mistakes in the early stages of the movement, had returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and firmly supported the Red Rebels.

For cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who persist in their errors and are incorrigible, according to Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," they are subjected to serious criticism and patient help. They are welcomed to revolutionize, correct their mistakes, rebel, and return to Chairman Mao's correct line. As for a handful of cadres within the party who are taking the capitalist road, they are resolutely overthrown and power is thoroughly seized.

(2) Actively carrying out ideological struggle within the organization, deeply touching the soul, thoroughly eliminating the "selfish" attitude, and completely abandoning the erroneous view of "overthrowing everything" which is "left" in form but right in essence.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different ideologies and struggles within the party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection within the party of the class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things in society. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve them within the party, the life of the party would stop." The Red Rebels of the power plant, in the struggle for great alliance and seizure of power, timely grasped the two ideological trends within the organization regarding the cadre issue and actively carried out ideological struggle, which played a guarantee role in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

At the beginning of the alliance and seizure of power, the issue of how to correctly deal with cadres arose. Some units, as soon as they seized power, issued orders one after another, making all leading cadres step aside. Some units, although they did not issue orders, actually made all cadres step aside. Some people said: "Cadres are no good, all of them should be removed!" The Red Rebel Corps headquarters discovered this problem. Through studying Chairman Mao's relevant works and relevant articles in the *Red Flag* magazine, they realized that the view of opposing and overthrowing everything in the cadre issue is wrong.

Why did the erroneous view of "overthrowing everything" arise? They conducted investigations and research and realized that some people had insufficient understanding of the significance of "three-in-one combination, united seizure of power"; coupled with one-sided thinking methods and substituting emotions for policies, this was an error in understanding. At the same time, some people put "self" first; they were not seizing power for the proletariat but for small groups and individuals; some people were afraid that if they did not remove cadres from their positions, they would be subjected to retaliation in the future, and therefore also advocated overthrowing all cadres. To solve these problems, in addition to studying party policies and conducting big debates, they emphasized organizing Red Rebels to study *On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas*, carrying out rectification within the organization. The service personnel of the Red Rebel Corps and comrades within the organization together exposed their thoughts, examined the roots, fought against "self," and launched an attack on "I," establishing the idea of seizing power for the revolution and holding power for the people. They also proposed that whether one can resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy is an important sign of whether the Red Rebels truly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and it is also a matter of whether we can revolutionize to the end.

(3) The Red Rebels stepped forward to propagate the party's policies among the masses, turning the party's policies into the actions of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be good at turning the party's policies into the actions of the masses, to be good at making every movement and struggle of ours not only understood by the leading cadres but also understood and grasped by the broad masses, this is an art of Marxist-Leninist leadership. Whether our work commits errors or not, the boundary is here." The Red Rebel Corps of the power plant, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, analyzed the various views of the masses on cadres and clearly realized that an important condition for uniting revolutionary cadres to jointly seize and hold power is that the Red Rebels must step forward to propagate Chairman Mao's cadre policy among the masses, propagate the great significance of "three-in-one combination, united seizure of power," criticize the erroneous view of "excluding everything," and truly implement the party's policies among the masses, turning them into the actions of the masses. The Red Rebels of this plant, before and after the seizure of power, repeatedly propagated the party's policies to the masses, patiently explaining the great significance of revolutionary masses uniting with revolutionary cadres to seize power, making the masses fully understand Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and truly changing their minds.

In one department, when preparing to form a seizure of power small group, the service personnel of the Red Rebel Corps actively went among the masses to propagate Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the spirit of the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine, explaining that those cadres who had already rebelled should be allowed to participate in the leadership work. However, at that time, some masses had insufficient understanding of the significance of "three-in-one combination, united seizure of power," and some people said things like "cadres are no good," "it is not yet clear which cadres are proletarian authorities," advocating "excluding everything," and even criticizing the headquarters for being "rightist," "mixing things up," and "detaching from the masses." In this situation, the Red Rebel Corps headquarters conducted a specific analysis and believed that the masses proposed such criticism precisely because the headquarters' work was not done well enough and had not yet handed over the party's cadre policy to the masses. Therefore, they stepped forward, continuing to patiently and repeatedly propagate Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the spirit of the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine among the masses, and pointed out that they should be alert to the malicious intentions of others to disrupt. Through in-depth work, the vast majority of the masses realized that for cadres who have made mistakes, they should be treated differently according to Chairman Mao's teachings, especially uniting with those "revolutionary" cadres to jointly hold great power. Now, they have united with revolutionary cadres to jointly hold power and have also absorbed revolutionary cadres into the ranks of the Red Rebels.

The masses are reasonable and are the most adept at identifying and dealing with cadres according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Many facts in this plant prove that as long as cadres who have made mistakes have the determination and actual actions to correct their mistakes and truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and as long as the Red Rebels do the necessary work among the masses, then the view of "excluding everything" has no market, and the revolutionary masses can truly unite with revolutionary cadres.

(4) For leading cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who persist in their errors and are incorrigible, the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" is resolutely implemented. There is both serious criticism and patient help, making them stand up in the criticism and education of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We oppose subjectivism, sectarianism, and party jargon, and there are two principles that must be noted: first is 'punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones,' and second is 'curing the sickness to save the patient.' For past mistakes, they must be exposed without mercy, and past bad things must be analyzed and criticized with a scientific attitude to make future work more cautious and better. This is the meaning of 'punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones.' However, the purpose of exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings is, just like a doctor treating a disease, completely to save people, not to kill people." The Red Rebels of the power plant believe that due to the different degrees of mistakes made by many cadres in their past work, especially the mistakes of the bourgeois reactionary line made during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they were to a certain extent in an antagonistic position with the masses. For cadres who have made serious mistakes, if the masses are not mobilized to criticize them, their mistakes cannot be corrected, the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line cannot be eliminated, and the conditions for their unity with the revolutionary masses cannot be met. Therefore, criticizing the mistakes of cadres and making them stand up in front of the masses is an important prerequisite for uniting with cadres. The Red Rebels of this plant, after achieving the victory of the seizure of power, immediately carried out a deeper criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, launching a movement called "people's war" by the masses throughout the plant. All workshops and departments successively held meetings to "thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line," letting cadres who had made mistakes inspect their own mistakes and listen to the criticism of the masses. The eyes of the masses are the brightest, and they see the mistakes of cadres the clearest. Their one-pointed criticism deeply touched the souls of the cadres, saving many cadres. Through one criticism after another, the mistakes of the cadres and their attitudes towards their mistakes were seen more clearly, and some cadres who had basically "come out" were trusted by the masses again. Many cadres who had made line mistakes sincerely said: "The criticism of the masses is to 'beat' us into revolutionaries! The more criticism, the firmer our confidence to follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize to the end!"

The process of criticizing cadres who have made mistakes is also the process of the Red Rebels patiently helping them, in one word, it is the process of using Mao Zedong Thought to reform cadres. Some cadres, when the masses criticized them, had many worries and the word "fear" was at the forefront. They were afraid of being punished and dared not frankly inspect their mistakes and explain their problems; they were afraid that the masses would not let go and dared not go among the masses; some dared not work boldly, wanted to drop their responsibilities, and even waited to be removed. These ideological problems seriously affected their recognition, inspection, and correction of mistakes. At this time, the Red Rebels, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, with great enthusiasm for cadres who had made mistakes, used great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work for them, encouraging them to put down their burdens, remove their worries, recognize their mistakes, change their stance, stand up to rebel, pass the socialist test, and resolutely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

First, they insisted on organizing cadres who had made mistakes to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. The Red Rebels, as early as last December when preparing to seize power, insisted on organizing cadres to collectively study Chairman Mao's works and relevant documents of the Cultural Revolution. In the past month or so, the Red Rebel Corps headquarters organized them to study, with the problems of whether to insist on mistakes or correct them, whether to continue to oppose the masses or believe the masses and go among the masses, whether to be half-revolutionary or revolutionary to the end, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and relevant quotations on the mass line, as well as the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine "On the Struggle for Seizure of Power by the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat," etc. This is studying in the struggle, studying on the front line, and the problems are put very sharply, greatly touching the cadres who had made mistakes. Many people, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," realized that they had not stood on the position of defending Chairman Mao and defending Mao Zedong Thought but on the wrong position of defending the authorities who were taking the capitalist road. Therefore, they voluntarily exposed their thoughts and explained their problems. Some people, after studying "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," deeply touched their souls and decided to go among the masses, "take off their pants and cut off their tails," thoroughly criticize their own mistakes, reform their worldview, and follow Chairman Mao to make a revolution for life.

Second, they insisted on providing individual patient help. This plant has dozens of middle-level and above cadres who have made mistakes, and the Red Rebels have conducted multiple individual help sessions for them, repeatedly explaining the policies to them and patiently inspiring and guiding them to return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This work of saving cadres is not an exception even for those who have made more serious mistakes.

Third, they used typical examples to guide cadres. The Red Rebels of this plant used the examples of cadres who had made serious mistakes but had deeply inspected and firmly corrected them to organize cadres to learn, let them look in the mirror, inspect and compare themselves, and thoroughly correct their mistakes.

Through serious criticism and patient help for cadres who had made mistakes, the goals of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades were indeed achieved. Some cadres who had made mistakes worked while being criticized and educated by the masses, and many cadres indeed stood up in the criticism and education of the masses.

The Red Rebels of the Harbin Power Plant, in the struggle for united seizure of power, achieved remarkable results and had a great impact by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and combining revolutionary masses with revolutionary cadres.

The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has been further internalized. The process of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy is the process of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. The Red Rebels, through the fiery struggle practice, have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a stronger love for the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The struggle for seizure of power has achieved victory. The Red Rebels united with revolutionary cadres and, as early as January 14, seized the power of a handful of cadres within the party who were taking the capitalist road, making this enterprise embark on a new journey.

They have grown stronger and struck at the enemy. The Red Rebels united with revolutionary cadres and gained the support of the majority. Many cadres who had made mistakes launched a counterattack, exposed and criticized, making a handful of cadres within the party who were taking the capitalist road look miserable. In the struggle, the leftist forces were further strengthened, and a handful of cadres within the party who were taking the capitalist road were further isolated and struck.

"Grasp the revolution and promote production" has achieved new victories. The Red Rebels united with revolutionary cadres and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp the revolution and promote production," using revolutionary methods to smash the old management structure and establish a new revolutionary order, quickly creating a historical record of the best coal consumption and electricity saving in the plant, with production booming and the factory's appearance completely renewed.

    用毛泽东思想识别和对待干部
    ——哈尔滨发电厂红色造反团贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的经验
    《哈尔滨战报》记者
    哈尔滨发电厂红色造反团，在红色造反者大联合和夺权斗争中，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，按照毛主席制定的干部政策，发动广大革命群众，用毛泽东思想识别干部，教育干部，重视革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用，支持和依靠站在毛主席革命路线一边的革命干部；团结那些犯有错误但是愿意革命并有所表现的干部；孤立、打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从而保证了夺权斗争的胜利，保证了夺权成果的巩固和发展。
    （一）坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，对各类干部实行区别对待，依靠站在毛主席革命路线一边的干部；团结犯有错误但愿意革命并有所表现的干部；坚决打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”《红旗》杂志第三期社论还指出：“必须足够重视革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用。”哈尔滨发电厂红色造反者根据毛主席的教导，在夺权斗争中，运用阶级分析的方法，识别干部，对待干部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席制定的干部政策，对各类干部区别对待。
    对于站在毛主席革命路线一边的干部，坚决信任，坚决支持，坚决依靠。这个厂原运行四值值长（相当于车间主任）李子荣，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，早在去年八月红色造反者刚刚成立自己的组织时，就参加了红色造反者的队伍。他不顾被打成“叛党分子”的威胁，坚决起来造反。在斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、炮轰厂党委贯彻资产阶级反动路线的御用工具“文革筹委会”、瓦解保守派组织以及红色造反者全厂夺权等一系列重大斗争中，李子荣与全体红色造反者坚定地站在一起，冲锋陷阵。因此，在夺权以后，他被选入全厂的生产领导核心——“生产监督委员会”。二月八日，彻底改组旧的生产班子，他又被选入工厂生产勤务组。此外，这个厂的红色造反者对那些虽然在运动初期犯过错误，但已经回到毛主席的革命路线上来，坚决支持红色造反者的干部，也同样充分信任，坚决依靠。
    对于犯有错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，按照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，对他们进行严肃批判和耐心帮助，欢迎他们革命，欢迎他们改正错误，起来造反，回到毛主席的正确路线上来。而对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决打倒，彻底夺权。
    （二）积极开展团内的思想斗争，狠触灵魂，大破“私”字，彻底抛弃“打倒一切”的形“左”实右的错误观点。
    毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”发电厂红色造反者，在大联合和夺权斗争中，及时抓住团内对待干部问题的两种思潮，积极地开展了思想斗争，对执行毛主席的干部政策起了保证作用。
    联合夺权一开始，就遇到了如何正确对待干部的问题。有的单位刚刚夺权，就连连发布通令，让所有领导干部统统靠边站。有些单位虽然没有下通令，但是干部实际上都已经靠边站了。有人讲：“干部没好货，统统刷！”红色造反团总部发现这个问题，通过学习毛主席的有关著作和《红旗》杂志的有关文章，认识到在干部问题上，反对一切，打倒一切的观点是错误的。
    为什么产生“打倒一切”的错误观点？他们经过调查研究认识到，一些人对实现“三位一体，联合夺权”的意义认识不足；加上思想方法的片面性，以感情代替政策，这是认识上的错误。同时，也有一些人“私”字当头，他们不是为无产阶级夺权，而是为了小团体和个人夺权；有人担心不把干部整下台，将来会受到打击报复，因而也主张打倒一切干部。为了解决这些问题，他们除了学习党的政策，开展大辩论之外，突出的是组织红色造反者学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，开展团内整风。红色造反团的服务员和团内同志一道，亮思想，查根源，向“私”字斗争，向“我”字开火，树立起夺权为革命、掌权为人民的思想。他们还提出，能不能坚决按照毛主席的干部政策办事，是衡量红色造反者是不是真正站在毛主席的革命路线上的一个重要标志，也是关系到我们能否革命到底的问题。
    （三）红色造反者挺身而出，到群众中宣传党的政策，使党的政策变为群众的行动。
    毛主席教导我们：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”发电厂红色造反团，根据毛主席的教导，分析了群众对干部的各种看法，清楚地认识到，团结革命干部共同夺权掌权的一个重要条件，是红色造反者必须挺身而出，到群众中宣传毛主席的干部政策，宣传“三位一体，联合夺权”的重大意义，批判“排斥一切”的错误观点，真正把党的政策落实到群众中去，变成群众的行动。这个厂的红色造反者，在夺权斗争前后反复地向群众宣传党的政策，耐心地说明革命群众同革命干部联合夺权的重大意义，让群众充分理解毛主席的干部政策，从心里真正转过弯子来。
    有个部门筹备组成夺权小组时，红色造反团的服务员，主动到群众中去，宣传毛主席的干部政策，宣传《红旗》杂志社论精神，说明应该让那些已经起来造反的干部参加领导工作。但是，当时有些群众对“三位一体，联合夺权”的意义认识不足，有的人说什么“干部没好货”，“现在还看不出哪些干部是无产阶级当权派”，宣扬“排斥一切”，并且批评总部“右倾”、“和稀泥”、“脱离群众”。在这种情况下，红色造反团总部进行了具体分析，他们认为，群众所以提出这种批评，正是表明总部的工作做得不够，还没有把党的干部政策交给群众。于是，他们挺身而出，继续耐心地、反复地向群众宣传毛主席的干部政策，宣传《红旗》杂志社论精神，并且指出，要警惕别有用心的人阴谋破坏。经过深入的工作，绝大多数群众认识到，对犯错误的干部，应该按照毛主席的教导，根据他们的情况，实行区别对待，特别是要团结那些“亮相”的革命干部共同掌好大权。现在，他们已经和革命干部结合起来，共同掌权，并吸收革命干部参加了红色造反者队伍。
    群众是通情达理的，是最善于按照毛主席的教导识别干部、对待干部的。这个厂的许多事实证明，只要犯错误的干部有改正错误的决心和实际行动，真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来，只要红色造反者到群众中进行必要的工作，那么，“排斥一切”的观点就没有市场，革命群众就能够同革命干部真正结合起来。
    （四）对待犯了错误的领导干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就坚决实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，既有严肃批判，又有耐心帮助，使他们在群众的批判教育中站立起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们反对主观主义、宗派主义、党八股，有两条宗旨是必须注意的：第一是‘惩前毖后’，第二是‘治病救人’。对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去的坏东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些。这就是‘惩前毖后’的意思。但是我们揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好象医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死。”发电厂红色造反者认为，由于许多干部在过去的工作中，犯有不同程度的错误，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，犯有资产阶级反动路线的错误，他们便同群众在一定程度上处于对立地位。对犯有严重错误的干部，如果不发动群众对他们进行批判，他们的错误不能得到纠正，资产阶级反动路线的流毒不能肃清，他们同革命群众相结合的条件也就不可能具备。因此，批判干部的错误，使他们在群众面前站起来，是团结干部的一个重要前提。这个厂的红色造反者，在取得夺权胜利之后，立即对资产阶级反动路线进行了更深入的批判，在全厂开展了一场被群众称为“人民战争”的活动，所有车间、科室，都相继召开“彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线流毒大会”，让犯有错误的干部，检查自己的错误，听取群众的批判。群众的眼睛最亮，对干部的错误看得最清。他们一针见血的批判，狠触了干部的灵魂，挽救了不少干部。通过一次又一次的群众性批判活动，对干部的错误和他们对错误的态度，都看得比较清楚了，一些基本“亮相”的革命干部，重新得到群众的信任。许多犯路线错误的干部，发自内心地说：“群众的批判，是为了把我们‘打’成革命派！越批判，我们跟着毛主席革命到底的信心越坚定！”
    对犯错误的干部进行批判的过程，也是红色造反者向他们进行耐心帮助的过程，一句话，是用毛泽东思想改造干部的过程。一些干部在群众批判他们时，顾虑重重，“怕”字当头。他们害怕受处分，不敢大胆地检查错误和交代问题；他们害怕群众揪住不放，不敢到群众中去；也有人不敢大胆工作，想撂挑子，甚至等着下台。这些思想问题，严重影响了他们认识错误，检查错误，改正错误。这时，红色造反者根据毛主席的教导，对犯错误的干部怀着满腔热情，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，针对他们的思想问题，进行深入细致的思想政治工作，鼓励他们放下包袱，解除顾虑，认识错误，改变立场，站出来造反，过好社会主义关，坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    首先，坚持组织犯错误的干部带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。红色造反者早在去年年底准备夺权的时候，就坚持每周都组织干部集体学习毛主席著作和文化大革命有关文件。近一个多月来，红色造反团总部先后组织他们带着是坚持错误还是改正错误，是继续同群众对立，还是相信群众，到群众中去，是半截革命，还是革命到底等问题，反复学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《将革命进行到底》和有关群众路线的语录，以及《红旗》杂志社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》等文件。这是在斗争中学习，在火线上学习，问题摆得十分尖锐，对犯错误的干部触动极大。许多人学习《为人民服务》之后，认识到自己没有站在保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想的立场上，而是站在保走资本主义道路当权派的错误立场上，于是自觉地亮思想，交代问题。一些人学习《将革命进行到底》以后，狠触了灵魂，决心到群众中去，“脱下裤子割尾巴”，彻底批判自己的错误，改造世界观，跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命。
    其次，坚持进行个别的耐心帮助。这个厂有几十名犯有错误的中层以上干部，红色造反者都曾经针对他们的思想，进行过多次个别帮助，反复地向他们交代政策，耐心启发诱导他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。这种挽救干部的工作，即使对那些错误比较严重的人，也不例外。
    再次，用典型给干部引路。这个厂的红色造反者，运用犯有严重错误，但是检查深刻、改正坚决的干部的事例，组织干部学习，让他们照镜子，检查对照自己，彻底改正错误。
    经过对犯错误干部的严肃批判，耐心帮助，确实达到了既弄清思想，又团结同志的目的。一些犯有错误的干部，边做工作，边受批判教育，不少干部确实在群众的批判教育中站起来了。
    哈尔滨发电厂红色造反者，在联合夺权的斗争中，由于坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，实行革命群众同革命干部相结合，取得显著成果，产生很大影响。
    光辉的毛泽东思想更加深入人心。他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的过程，就是在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的过程。红色造反者经过火热的斗争实践，对毛主席的革命路线的理解更加深刻，对伟大的毛泽东思想的热爱更加强烈。
    夺权斗争取得了胜利。红色造反者同革命干部相结合，早在一月十四日，就夺了这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，使这个企业跨上了新的里程。
    壮大了自己，打击了敌人。红色造反者同革命干部相结合，取得了大多数人的拥护。许多犯有错误的干部，纷纷大杀回马枪，大揭大批，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭得狼狈不堪。在斗争中，进一步壮大了左派队伍，孤立和打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    “抓革命，促生产”，取得了新胜利。红色造反者同革命干部相结合，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，采取革命的方法，打碎旧的管理机构，建立起革命的新秩序，迅速创造出本厂耗煤节电的历史最好纪录，生产蒸蒸日上，工厂面貌焕然一新。
