Mao Zedong Thought is a red beacon, illuminating the path for the oppressed peoples and nations of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world in their struggle for freedom.

The peoples of the various African countries have come to understand the importance of learning Mao Zedong Thought, for without mastering and implementing this brilliant thought, it is impossible to carry out a revolution. Based on the principles of internationalism and aiding the peoples of new nations, as proposed by the world's great teacher Chairman Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people, under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao, have extended an unconditional helping hand to the peoples of the new African nations.

During our visits to some African countries, we saw how Chinese experts and technicians, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, were helping the African people build, while we also saw how imperialists and saboteurs were destroying Africa and plundering its wealth.

The Chinese government, based on the principles of internationalism and aiding new nations, has built a sugar factory in Mali. Under the guidance of the creative Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese experts have shattered the lie propagated by colonialists that sugarcane cannot grow on Malian soil. The Chinese experts, together with their Malian brothers, planted vast sugarcane fields to supply the sugar factory.

In the Guinean capital of Conakry, a magnificent building stands on a hill, let history bear witness to the aid China provides to friendly African nations! This is the "People's Palace," which includes a grand hall, a large stage, and many offices. This is a gift of unconditional aid from China to the Guinean people.

By making a simple comparison, we recognize that the aid provided by China to the peoples of the various African countries is vastly different from the so-called aid that the Soviet revisionists boast of providing us. Let us take the example of a Soviet expert. This so-called expert, before even setting out, demanded the fulfillment of many conditions: he wanted to live in a villa, each room to have air conditioning, a fancy car, and servants from the receiving country. What is even more shameful is that when these Soviet experts design and draw plans, they do not allow local workers to be present, fearing that the local workers might learn the "professional secrets."

What about the Chinese experts? In Conakry, we saw with our own eyes a Chinese expert who gathered many local workers together and sincerely explained the design plans to them, teaching them how to become self-reliant in the future. When I asked a Guinean worker about their interactions with the Chinese experts, he replied:

"You call them Chinese experts? You mean our Chinese brothers! They are our brothers, they never make us feel that what they know we do not, there has never been a barrier between us."

In Dogobugu, Mali, we visited the quarters of the Chinese experts. From a distance, none of the members of the delegation thought that such a humble hut could be the experts' quarters. However, upon closer inspection, we saw large Chinese characters on the walls, and we realized this was the Chinese experts' quarters because the walls were covered with quotes from Chairman Mao. They lived in quarters made of tin and branches. Despite the hot climate, they were full of vigor, striving to increase production. This is not surprising, because they are students of the contemporary Lenin—Mao Zedong. Their great teacher is the great leader, great teacher, and great helmsman of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world—Chairman Mao.

    中国给予非洲人民的援助最真诚
    苏丹　哈密德·马哈茂德
    毛泽东思想是红色灯塔，它照亮了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取自由的道路。
    非洲各国人民已经懂得学习毛泽东思想的重要性，因为不掌握和执行这一光辉思想就不可能进行革命。根据世界人民的导师毛泽东主席所提出的国际主义和帮助新兴国家人民的原则，伟大的中国人民在坚强的中国共产党和伟大的毛主席领导下，向非洲新兴国家人民伸出了无条件的援助之手。
    在我们访问一些非洲国家的时候，我们看到了以毛泽东思想为指导的中国专家和技工正在如何帮助非洲人民建设，同时看到了帝国主义者和破坏者是在如何摧毁非洲和掠夺它的财富。
    中国政府根据国际主义和援助新兴国家的原则，在马里建立了制糖厂。在创造性的毛泽东思想教导下的中国专家们粉碎了殖民主义者所说的甘蔗不能在马里土地上生长的谎言。中国专家们同他们的马里兄弟们一起，种植了供该糖厂生产的大面积甘蔗园。
    在几内亚首都科纳克里，一座山丘似的宏伟建筑物矗立着，让历史证明中国向友好的非洲国家所提供的援助吧！这是一座“人民宫”，里面有大会堂、大舞台、许多办公室。这是中国无条件援助几内亚人民而建筑的。
    简单地比较一下，我们认识到了中国给我们非洲各国人民所提供的援助，同那些苏联修正主义者宣扬的他们给我们提供的所谓援助之间有着很大的区别。让我们举个苏联某一个专家的例子。这个所谓的专家在他启程来到之前，就要求实现他的许多条件：他要住在别墅里，每个房间要有冷气调节设备，要一辆精巧的汽车，还要受援国的人侍候他。而比这更可耻的是，当这些苏联专家们设计画图的时候，根本不让本地工人在旁边，他们害怕本地工人掌握“专业秘密”。
    中国专家是怎样的呢？在科纳克里，我们亲眼看到一位中国专家，把当地许多工人召集在一起，真心诚意地向他们解说设计方案，告诉他们如何将来自力更生。当我向一位几内亚工人问及他们同中国专家相处的情况时，他回答我说：
  “你称谁是中国专家？你是指我们的中国兄弟吧！他们是我们的弟兄，他们从来不使我们感到他们懂得的事我们不懂得，他们和我们之间从没有障碍。”
    在马里的多加布古，我们访问了中国专家的宿舍。在远处时，代表团的成员中没有一个人认为那样简陋的茅屋竟然是专家们的宿舍。但是，在近处，我们看到墙壁上的中文大标语，才晓得这是中国专家的宿舍，因为墙壁上到处都用粗体字写上了毛主席语录。他们居住在用白铁皮和树枝架起来的宿舍里。尽管气候炎热，他们仍然干劲十足，以求增加生产。这不奇怪，因为他们是当代列宁——毛泽东的学生。他们的导师是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的伟大领袖、伟大导师、伟大舵手毛主席。
