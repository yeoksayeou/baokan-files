African youth deeply respect Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts, viewing him as the great leader of the world's people, and regarding the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding light in the struggle. They are diligently studying Chairman Mao's works and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's wise teachings and throw themselves into the fiery struggle.

One day, six young people from the Congo (Brazzaville), Cameroon, and two other African countries gathered together, but they only had two copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They began to read and study together.

One of them first read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people, full of vigor and vitality, are in the ascendant, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you. The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you."

The great leader Chairman Mao's trust and expectations for the youth stirred their hearts, and they engaged in a heated discussion. They unanimously agreed that just as the future of China belongs to the Chinese youth, the future of Africa belongs to the African youth, and the future of the world belongs to the revolutionary youth of China, Africa, and other regions of the world. They said that this passage from Chairman Mao's quotations inspires African youth to wage the struggle for national liberation against imperialism.

Finally, they read another passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the whole world should have courage, dare to fight, not fear difficulties, and press on. Then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

These six African youth, although coming from different countries, had their hearts united by the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of progressive African youth enthusiastically praise the great and boundless Mao Zedong Thought for illuminating the revolutionary path of the African people.

One African youth said: "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the oppressed peoples of the world. What he says is not only for the Chinese people but also for us, the African people. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings can our motherland, the African continent, achieve true liberation."

Another African youth said: "I love reading Chairman Mao's works very much. The more I read, the clearer my mind becomes, and the more truths I understand. Studying the great thought of Mao Zedong and putting it into practice, our future is boundless and brilliant."

    非洲青年越读毛主席的书心里越亮堂
    遵循毛主席教导，非洲就能取得解放
    据新华社开罗电　非洲青年从心底里敬爱毛主席，把毛主席看成世界人民的伟大领袖，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想看作自己斗争中的指路明灯。他们努力学习毛主席著作，决心遵循毛主席的英明教导，投入火热的斗争中去。
    一天，来自刚果（利）、喀麦隆等四个非洲国家的六位青年在一道聚会了，但是他们只有两本《毛主席语录》，于是就集体阅读和学习起来。
    其中一人先念了一段毛主席的语录：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。……世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”
    伟大的领袖毛主席对青年的信任和期望使他们的心情激动起来，展开了热烈的讨论。他们一致认为，正象中国的前途属于中国青年一样，非洲的前途属于非洲青年，全世界的前途属于中国、非洲和世界其他地区革命的青年一代。他们说，这段毛主席语录鼓舞着非洲青年去进行争取民族解放的反帝斗争。
    最后，他们又念了一段毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”这六个非洲青年虽然来自不同的国家，但是，他们的心却被伟大的毛泽东思想连结在一起了。
    广大的非洲进步青年，热烈赞扬伟大的光焰无际的毛泽东思想照亮了非洲人民革命的道路。
    一个非洲青年说：“毛主席是世界被压迫人民的伟大领袖，他所讲的不仅是为了中国人民，而且也为了我们非洲人民。只有遵循毛主席的教导，我们的母亲——非洲大陆，才能取得真正的解放。”
    还有一个非洲青年说：“我非常爱读毛主席的著作，我越读头脑就越清醒，懂得的真理就越多。学习毛泽东的伟大思想，并把它贯彻到行动中去，我们的前途是广阔无边的，是光辉灿烂的。”
