Seize power! Seize power! Seize power! Place the financial power of the state in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. This was the strong desire of the revolutionary rebels of the Ministry of Finance. On January 20, 1967, this desire was solemnly realized. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has given us boundless wisdom and strength, enabling us to dare to rebel, dare to seize power, and dare to take charge!

To seize power, we must fight against the capitalist roaders in power within the party, fight against the stubborn conservative forces, and also fight against the selfish thoughts in our own minds. Where do the revolutionary rebels' weapons of struggle come from? They come from the great Mao Zedong Thought. The focus of the struggle revolves around the following aspects.

First, daring or not daring. The handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line always try every means to poison the masses with slavery ideology. They blow cold winds, saying things like: "So and so is an 'old revolutionary,' 'old experience,' 'old status,' 'a cadre of several levels,'" and so on. They try to intimidate us so that we dare not rise up to seize power. Some deceived masses may also echo these words. No! We do not believe in that. Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The masses are the real heroes." You gentlemen who sit high above the masses, acting as officials and lords, have long since degenerated. You wear a sheep's head but sell dog meat. When your masks are torn off, you are nothing but agents of the bourgeoisie within the party. No matter how great your skills are, at best you are serving the restoration of capitalism. We have seen through you. "Pointing at the rivers and mountains, stirring up words, treating the heroes of the past as dung." We dare to despise you, dare to compete with you, and dare to seize your power. Not familiar with the work? What's the big deal. Once freed from your control, what is unfamiliar will quickly become familiar. Afraid of risks? Nonsense! Facing the rampant counter-revolutionary economism, who stood up to raise the banner of "seize the revolution and promote production," to resist the counter-revolutionary economism, and to defend the socialist economic foundation? It was the revolutionary rebels who seized power. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must eliminate all cowardly and weak thoughts within ourselves. Any view that overestimates the enemy's strength and underestimates the people's strength is wrong." Solving this problem of awareness is the prerequisite for seizing power.

Second, believing or not believing. Chairman Mao repeatedly admonishes us: "We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the party." We revolutionary rebels, in the sharp and complex class struggle, must firmly believe in Chairman Mao and firmly believe in the masses to achieve complete victory. Believing in Chairman Mao means reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line do not believe in or follow Chairman Mao's instructions. Not only that, they try every means to distort and resist, preventing the masses from hearing the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao, and attempting to use this to lead a part of the masses to follow them, striking and isolating the revolutionary rebels. At the most difficult and isolated times, we must firmly believe that the broad masses want revolution and love Chairman Mao. We must see that the masses being deceived is only a temporary phenomenon. We must keep up with the situation, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, expose the plots of the capitalist roaders in power within the party, educate and win over the broad intermediate masses, and isolate a handful of stubborn elements. In conducting ideological struggles, we must grasp the major issues and not get bogged down in minor issues. Our strength grew from small to large through three major battles. Each time, we timely exposed the plots of the capitalist roaders in power within the party and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, making the masses see their true faces and recognizing that the revolutionary rebels are the loyal defenders of Mao Zedong Thought, consciously uniting around the revolutionary rebels. In this way, the masses have the ideological foundation for seizing power.

Third, unity and struggle. Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The revolution relies on the masses, everyone should take action." Seizing power relies on the great unity of the revolutionary masses and opposes all sectarianism, small-groupism, and exclusivism. If this problem is not solved, seizing power may be reversed. "Only believing in one's own revolution, not believing in others' revolution" is one obstacle to the great unity of the revolutionary forces. "Previously, why did you stand by and watch when we rebelled? Now you come to join is opportunism." This argument is wrong. One must believe that the vast majority of the masses want revolution, and opportunists are only a handful. One must acknowledge that awareness has a process, and revolution is not divided into early and late. As long as one is sincere and daring, one should be welcomed. "Unity without conditions, the more the better" is also wrong. The premise of unity is a consistent direction. Without ideological unity, forced unity will necessarily be a "mishmash," and such unity can only ruin the organization and the revolution. There are several types of organizational unity. For those who have thorough revolutionary demands and can act on them, they should be absorbed into the rebel organization, which is one type of unity. For those who have common demands in a certain stage of struggle, temporary external unity can be achieved, which is another type of unity. Within the rebel ranks, one must oppose the one-man show, advocate great democracy, and fully carry out ideological struggles to promote the continuous revolutionization of the leadership core. Among organizations, the revolutionary rebels must have a clear banner and not yield on principle issues, using the spirit of thorough revolution and rebelling to the end to lead the intermediate masses and win over the backward layers. Against the stubborn forces, one must continuously expose and strike them, launch a fierce ideological offensive to isolate and disintegrate them. In short, without active ideological struggle, there can be no solid unity. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Seeking unity through struggle will preserve unity, seeking unity through compromise will lose unity." It is under this guiding ideology that we gradually expanded the ranks of the revolutionary rebels. It is under this guiding ideology that we, through struggle, achieved unity with the broad revolutionary masses, maintained the absolute leadership of the revolutionary rebels, and relatively smoothly carried out the seizure of power.

Fourth, thorough revolution and half-hearted revolution. Having seized power, how to maintain it is a new topic. Solving this problem can only be done by following Chairman Mao's teaching of "thorough revolution." Thorough revolution, and the power will be maintained; half-hearted revolution, and the power will be lost.

Chairman Mao warns us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggle.... They will try every day and every hour to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable, beyond doubt, and we must never relax our vigilance." This law of class struggle also applies to the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line who have been seized of power. They will certainly still play tricks, shoot dark arrows, regroup their forces, and attempt to make a comeback. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by learning from King Xiang Yu." Against them, there can be no compromise, no half-measures, no leniency or complacency, and they must be pursued to the end without mercy.

On the other hand, the revolutionary rebel fighters also have the issue of breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and thorough revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because of victory, arrogance, the sense of being a hero, the sense of stagnation and not seeking progress, the desire for enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life may grow within the party." In the short time since seizing power, the exposed bureaucratic habits, fame-seeking thoughts, and small-groupism have shown that the "self" is still prevalent within the rebel ranks. Through active ideological struggles, we must use the method of rectification to eliminate these mental garbage, otherwise, the revolutionary rebels will not be able to maintain their role as the locomotive of the Cultural Revolution. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, and continue the revolution thoroughly, until the complete liberation of humanity.

    毛泽东思想是大联合大夺权的强大武器
    财政部革命造反司令部
    夺权！夺权！夺权！把国家的财政大权掌握到无产阶级革命派手里，这是财政部革命造反派的强烈愿望。一九六七年一月二十日，这个愿望庄严地实现了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的智慧和力量，使我们敢造反，敢夺权，敢于当家作主！
    夺权，要和走资本主义道路的当权派斗，要和顽固保守势力斗，也要和自己头脑里的私心杂念斗。革命造反派的斗争武器那里来？来自伟大的毛泽东思想。斗争的焦点围绕着以下几个方面。
    第一，敢与不敢。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，总是千方百计用奴隶主义毒害群众。他们吹阴风，说什么：谁谁谁是“老革命”、“老经验”、“老资格”、“几级干部”，离开这样一些人，你们干得了吗？妄图吓唬我们，使我们不敢起来夺权。有些受蒙蔽的群众也不免随声附和。不！我们就是不信那一套。毛主席从来教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄”。你们这些先生们高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，早已蜕化变质。你们挂的是羊头，卖的是狗肉。把你们的画皮揭开，不过是资产阶级在党内的代理人。你们的本事再大，充其量还是为资本主义复辟效劳。这一点我们算看透了你们。“指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。”我们就是敢于藐视你们，敢于和你们较量，敢于夺你们的权。业务不熟吗？那有什么了不起。摆脱了你们的控制，不熟的很快就能熟起来。担不起风险么？胡说！面临反革命经济主义的泛滥，是谁挺身而出，高举抓革命、促生产的大旗，抵制反革命经济主义的逆流，捍卫了社会主义的经济基础？是夺了权的革命造反派。毛主席教导我们说：“我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高地估计敌人力量和过低地估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。”解决这个认识问题，是夺权的前提。
    第二，信与不信。毛主席谆谆告诫我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党”。我们革命造反派，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，只有坚信毛主席，坚信群众，才能取得彻底的胜利。坚信毛主席，就是要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们对毛主席的指示是不信的，不跟的。不仅如此，他们还要想尽办法歪曲抵制，让群众听不到伟大领袖毛主席的声音，妄想借此拉一部分群众跟着他们跑，打击和孤立革命造反派。我们在极端困难和十分孤立的时候，一定要坚信广大群众是要革命的，是热爱毛主席的。一定要看到群众受蒙蔽，只是暂时的现象。一定要紧跟形势，宣传毛泽东思想，揭露党内走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，教育和争取广大中间群众，孤立一小撮顽固分子。在进行思想斗争时一定要抓住大是大非，而不去纠缠小是小非。我们的力量由小变大，经过了三次大搏斗。每一次搏斗，我们都及时地揭露了党内走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的阴谋，使群众识破了他们的真面目，认识到革命造反派是毛泽东思想的忠实捍卫者，自觉地团结到革命造反派的周围。这样，在群众中才具备了实现夺权的思想基础。
    第三，联合与斗争。毛主席历来教导我们：“革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手”。夺权就要依靠革命群众的大联合，就要反对一切宗派主义、小团体主义、关门主义。不解决这个问题，夺权就可能有反复。“只相信自己要革命，不相信人家也要革命”，这是实现革命派大联合的障碍之一。“以前我们造反，你为什么袖手旁观，现在来是投机。”这种论调不对。要相信绝大多数群众是要革命的，投机分子只是一小撮。要承认，认识要有过程，革命不分先后。只要是诚心的，敢干的，就应当欢迎。“联合不要讲条件，来者不拒，多多益善”，这种观点也是不对的。联合的前提是大方向一致。没有思想上的统一，勉强凑合必然是“大杂烩”，这样的联合只能断送组织，断送革命。组织上的联合有几种。对于那些有彻底革命要求，又能见之于行动的人，把他们吸收到造反组织内部，这是一种联合。对某一阶段的斗争有共同要求的人，可以实行组织外部的暂时联合，这是另一种联合。在造反派内部，要反对一言堂，发扬大民主，充分展开思想斗争，促使领导核心不断革命化。在组织之间，革命造反派必须旗帜鲜明，在原则问题上毫不让步，用彻底革命和造反到底的精神，带动中间群众，争取落后层。对顽固势力要不断揭露、打击，展开凌厉的思想攻势，以孤立和瓦解他们。总之，不展开积极的思想斗争，就不可能有巩固的联合。毛主席教导我们：“以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡”。我们就是在这样的指导思想下，逐步扩大了革命造反派的队伍。我们就是在这样的指导思想下，通过斗争，实现了对广大革命群众的团结，保持了革命造反派的绝对领导地位，比较顺利地进行了夺权。
    第四，彻底革命和半截革命。夺了权，如何保权，这是一个新课题。解决这个问题，只有遵循毛主席的教导“彻底革命”。彻底革命，“权”就可以保住；半截革命，“权”必然丧失。
    毛主席告诫我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。……他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”这一条阶级斗争的规律也同样适用于被夺了权的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和那些顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人。他们必然还要耍阴谋、放暗箭，重新纠合力量，妄图卷土重来。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”对他们来不得半点调和、折衷，不能有丝毫的温情和麻痹松懈，对他们必须乘胜追击，一反到底。
    另一方面，革命造反派战士也有一个破“私”立“公”、彻底革命的问题。毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”夺权以后的短短时间，已经暴露出来的官僚习气、名利思想、小团体主义，说明“私”字在造反派内部仍然是有市场的。必须通过积极的思想斗争，用整风的方法扫除这些头脑里的垃圾，否则革命造反派就将不能保持文化大革命的火车头作用。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，团结广大革命群众，不断革命，彻底革命，一直到人类的彻底解放。
