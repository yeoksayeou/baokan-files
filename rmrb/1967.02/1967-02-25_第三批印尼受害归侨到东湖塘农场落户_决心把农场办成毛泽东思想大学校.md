The third batch of over a thousand Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese who returned on the Guanghua ship have settled in the Donghutang Overseas Chinese Farm in Ningde County, Fujian Province, on February 19th and 20th. They have come to participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of their motherland.

On their way from Fuzhou City to Donghutang Farm, the returnees, filled with boundless love for the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "The Great Sea Navigates by the Helmsman." Upon arriving at the farm, the farm workers eagerly helped the elderly and children, arranging accommodations for each family. They also held friendly gatherings and discussions, studying the "Three Articles" together, and organized visits to the farm's various construction projects. The returnees expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the great leader Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for their meticulous care. They repeatedly vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They will work together with the old returnees in the farm to seize the revolution and promote production, launching the first spring plowing campaign, and turning the farm into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.
