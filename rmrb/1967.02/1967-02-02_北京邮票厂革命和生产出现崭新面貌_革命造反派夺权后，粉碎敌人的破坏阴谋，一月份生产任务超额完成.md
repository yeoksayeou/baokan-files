The thunder of spring shakes the heavens, and the red victory report spreads far and wide. After seizing power, the revolutionary rebel workers of the Beijing Stamp Factory have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Filled with revolutionary passion, they have taken on the attitude of masters and thrown themselves into the battle, making both revolution and production present a new look. Under the premise of ensuring quality, the average daily output has increased by eighty-seven percent compared to before the seizure of power, and the production plan for January has been overfulfilled.

In the previous period, a handful of capital roaders within the Party and a few diehards who stubbornly insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line in the factory used various conspiratorial means to incite some deceived workers to leave their production posts, attempting to sabotage production and lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution astray. Due to the sabotage by these bad elements, the factory's production once declined, and from January 1 to 17, the entire factory only completed one-third of the month's production tasks.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the factory realized that only by resolutely seizing the power of the handful of capital roaders within the Party could the revolutionary and production situation of the factory be fundamentally changed. Therefore, they united as one, seized the Party power, political power, and financial power of the entire factory, and immediately established the "Beijing Stamp Factory Revolutionary Rebel Committee," resolutely shouldering the dual responsibilities of revolution and production.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels aroused the extreme hatred of the handful of capital roaders within the Party. They threatened, "Power can be handed over, but there are many specific tasks, and technical problems are numerous. Without us, don't even think about completing the January production tasks!" These bad elements thought that without them, the factory's production would collapse. Hearing their nonsense, the revolutionary rebel workers were furious and decisively replied, "Shut up! Let us tell you, we revolutionary rebels not only dare to destroy an old world but also know how to build a new world! Without you, we will do even better!" The Revolutionary Rebel Committee immediately held an emergency meeting. They decided to respond to the provocation of the handful of bad elements with actual actions, calling on revolutionary rebel workers to actively take the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production," continue to deeply criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, launch a new production high tide, and rearrange the production plan to make the tasks specific and fall to the people, so that everyone knows what to do.

The call of the Revolutionary Rebel Committee was warmly responded to by all the revolutionary workers in the factory. Some workers who were deceived and left their production posts also saw through the true face of the bourgeois reactionary line and decided to insist on eight-hour work and no longer leave their production posts at will. A hot and lively scene of "grasp revolution, promote production" quickly appeared in every workshop and every department.

In the struggle to "grasp revolution, promote production," revolutionary rebel workers always stood at the forefront of the battle, rushing to the most difficult places. One afternoon, the heating pipe in the second workshop suddenly broke, and a large amount of hot air gushed out from the manhole, with the temperature inside the manhole reaching over sixty degrees Celsius and the bottom filled with hot water. In such a situation, it was very difficult to go down to repair, and there was even a risk to life. If the pipe was not repaired in time and continued to leak, it would seriously affect the workshop's production. At this time, maintenance worker Zhao Yiqing thought: I am a revolutionary rebel worker and should act according to Chairman Mao's instruction: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is the good comrade." Thinking of this, he took off his cotton clothes and bravely crawled into the dark manhole, enduring the high temperature and crawling more than twenty meters, with sweat soaking his entire body. Finally, he found the leaking place and quickly repaired the pipe. The revolutionary workers in the third workshop, in order to improve the utilization rate of machinery and equipment and increase production, also proposed a reasonable suggestion to adjust the shifts, which was approved by the Revolutionary Rebel Committee. Worker Jiang Dashi was not in good health, but he was the first to volunteer for the night shift. Due to the workers' high production enthusiasm, after producing according to the new shifts, the output of the third workshop increased dramatically, the quality improved, and the output before the seizure of power was only fifty-four thousand prints (the calculation unit for color printing output) per day. Now it can produce more than eleven thousand five hundred prints per day, an increase of one hundred thirteen percent compared to before.

    北京邮票厂革命和生产出现崭新面貌
    革命造反派夺权后，粉碎敌人的破坏阴谋，一月份生产任务超额完成
    本报讯　春雷一声震天响，红色捷报传四方。北京邮票厂革命造反派职工在夺权以后，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，满怀革命激情，以主人翁的姿态投入战斗，使革命和生产都出现了崭新的面貌。在保证质量的前提下，平均日产量比夺权前增长了百分之八十七，一月份的生产计划已经超额完成。
    前一个时期，北京邮票厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，采取种种阴谋手段，煽动一些受蒙蔽的职工脱离生产岗位，妄图破坏生产，把无产阶级文化大革命引入歧途。由于这些坏家伙的破坏，使工厂生产一度下降，从一月一日到十七日，全厂仅完成全月生产任务的三分之一。
    工厂的革命造反派职工认识到，只有坚决地把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权夺过来，才能根本改变工厂革命和生产的面貌。于是，他们一致联合起来，夺了全厂的党权、政权、财权，并立即成立了“北京邮票厂革命造反委员会”，坚决挑起了革命、生产两副担子。
    革命造反派夺了权，引起了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的极度仇恨，他们威胁地说：“权交出来可以，但是具体工作很多，许多技术问题千头万绪，没有我们，一月份的生产任务甭想完成！”这些坏家伙以为，工厂离开了他们生产就会垮台了。听了他们这一派胡言乱语，革命造反派职工怒不可遏，斩钉截铁地回答：“住口！告诉你们，我们革命造反派不但敢于破坏一个旧世界，而且善于建设一个新世界！没有你们，我们会干得更好！”革命造反委员会当即召开了紧急会议，他们决心以实际行动来回答一小撮坏家伙的挑衅，号召革命造反派职工积极带头执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，继续深入批判资产阶级反动路线，掀起生产新高潮，重新安排了生产计划，使任务具体地落实到群众中去，做到人人心中有数。
    革命造反委员会的号召得到了全厂革命职工的热烈响应。一些受蒙蔽而离开生产岗位的职工，也认清了资产阶级反动路线的真面目，决心坚持八小时工作，再不随便离开生产岗位。一个抓革命、促生产的热气腾腾的新局面，迅速地出现在每一个车间，每一个科室。
    在“抓革命，促生产”的斗争中，革命造反派职工总是站在战斗的第一线，哪里最困难，他们就奔赴哪里。一天下午，二车间的暖气管道突然坏了，地沟口呼呼地冒出大量热气，地沟内温度高达摄氏六十多度，沟底积满了热水。在这种情况下，下去修理困难很多，甚至有生命危险。如果不及时下去修理，管道继续跑气，就会严重影响车间生产。这时，维修工赵义清想：我是一个革命造反派工人，应当按照毛主席的指示去做：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”想到这里，他脱掉棉衣，奋不顾身地钻进漆黑的地沟里，忍受着高温爬行二十多米，汗水湿透了全身，终于找到了漏气的地方，很快把管道抢修好了。第三车间的革命职工，为了提高机器设备的利用率，增加生产，还提出了调整班次的合理化建议，得到了革命造反委员会的批准。工人姜大石身体不好，但他第一个报名上大夜班。由于工人们生产热情高涨，在按照新班次生产以后，三车间的产量激剧增长，质量有所提高，夺权前，每天只能生产五万四千印（彩色印刷生产量的计算单位），现在每天能生产十一万五千多印，比以前增长了百分之一百一十三。
