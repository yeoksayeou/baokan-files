The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership are using the so-called 17-nation disarmament conference, which reconvened in Geneva on the 21st, to accelerate the promotion of the "non-proliferation treaty" scam. They are doing this to advance their counter-revolutionary global collusion and to adapt to their urgent need to jointly oppose China and engage in dirty deals on the Vietnam issue.

The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership have been engaged in intense activities to quickly conclude the "non-proliferation treaty." After the "disarmament conference" adjourned in August last year, especially after the U.S. and Soviet-controlled United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution advocating the acceleration of the conclusion of the "non-proliferation treaty" at the end of last year, they have conducted multiple secret negotiations. Due to the concessions and compromises made by the Soviet revisionists, significant progress has been made. Before and after the reconvening of the "disarmament conference," they have been drumming up support for the conclusion of this treaty, hoping to achieve "success" quickly.

U.S. President Johnson, in a letter to this conference, expressed his "eagerness" to soon finalize a draft treaty. He made it clear that U.S. imperialism wants to further promote its policy of nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail, so as to more freely suppress the surging national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In advocating for the "prevention of further proliferation of nuclear weapons," he said, "If we do not take immediate action, nuclear weapons will spread to regions of instability, where open wars have occurred in the past ten years."

The Soviet revisionist representative, Roshchin, on the first day of the conference, sang the same tune as the U.S. imperialists, shamelessly helping the U.S. to cover up its aggression, and absurdly claiming that the "non-proliferation treaty" can "become an important step towards eliminating the threat of nuclear war." In his speech, he did not hide his eagerness to conclude this deal, describing the conclusion of this treaty as a "mature and urgent international issue," and stating that the Soviet delegation would "spare no effort" to make the conference "progress."

Just as the U.S. imperialists are intensifying their "war for peace" plot on the Vietnam issue, the Soviet revisionists are engaging in "disarmament" deals with them, which is itself a criminal act of serving the U.S. aggressors. At this conference, the Soviet revisionist representative again openly performed a disgusting double act with the U.S. imperialist representative to peddle the "peace talks" plot. According to the U.S. News Agency, the Soviet revisionist representative Roshchin, in the meeting on the 21st, pretended to criticize the U.S.'s aggression in Vietnam, while the U.S. representatives were "well-prepared for this and did not consider this attack a threat to the prospect of concluding the treaty." Following this, the U.S. representative Foster, in "responding" to the Soviet representative, repeated the same old lies to pressure the Vietnamese people into surrender, saying that the U.S. is ready to move this "conflict" to the "peace" table, if the "other side" makes any "suggestions"—but "the other side has not made any suggestions yet." This exposes the sinister intentions of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists to use the "disarmament conference" to advance their plot to push for "peace talks" in Vietnam.

The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are hastening their collusion on the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation," and their target is also China. After China successfully conducted nuclear weapon tests last year, they are even more eager to conclude this deal.

The Soviet revisionist propaganda machine, *Pravda*, recently published an article on the "disarmament conference" that clearly exposed the Soviet revisionists' anti-China stance on this issue. The article blatantly equated the great socialist China with the West German militarist ruling clique, which harbors ambitions to seize nuclear weapons, and maliciously slandered China for exposing the U.S.-Soviet scam as being "far from the interests of peace," attempting to isolate China.

According to reports, this "disarmament conference" may continue until May of this year. France, a member of the United Nations 18-nation "disarmament" committee, as in the past, has refused to participate in this conference.

    美苏利用裁军会议大做反革命交易
    加紧推行越南“和谈”骗局，急于达成“防止核扩散”协议
    新华社二十二日讯  日内瓦消息：美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团正在利用二十一日在日内瓦复会的所谓十七国裁军会议，加速推行缔结“防止核扩散条约”的大骗局。它们这样做，是为了推进美苏反革命全球大勾结，是为了适应它们加紧联合反华和在越南问题上进行肮脏交易的需要。
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团为了早日在缔结“防止核扩散条约”问题上做成买卖，一直在进行紧张的活动。在去年八月“裁军会议”休会以后，特别是去年末美苏操纵联合国大会通过鼓吹加速缔结“防止核扩散条约”的决议以来，它们进行了多次秘密谈判，并且由于苏修的妥协和让步，取得了迅速的进展。“裁军会议”复会前后，它们更是密锣紧鼓，一唱一和地鼓吹缔结这个条约的“重要性”，希望迅速“取得成功”。
    美国总统约翰逊在写给这次会议的信中表示，他“热切地希望”不久就能搞成一项条约草案。他表明，美帝国主义要进一步推行核垄断和核讹诈政策，以便更加放手地镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲风起云涌的民族解放运动。他在鼓吹“防止进一步扩散核武器”时说，“如果我们不马上采取行动”，“核武器将扩展到潜藏着不稳定的地区，在这些地区，过去十年里已经发生了公开的战争”。
    苏修代表罗申在第一天会议上就同美帝国主义唱一个调子，无耻地帮助美帝粉饰侵略面貌，胡说什么“防止核扩散条约”可以“成为走向消除核战争威胁的道路上的重要阶段之一”。他在发言中毫不掩饰苏修急于搞成这项交易的迫切心情，把缔结这个条约说成是一个“成熟的、急迫的国际问题”，还表示苏联代表团要“不遗余力地”使会议取得“进展”。
    正当美帝国主义在越南问题上加紧推行“以战迫和”阴谋的时候，苏修同它大搞“裁军”交易，这本身就是为美国侵略者效劳的罪恶行径。在这次会议上，苏修代表又公然同美国帝国主义的代表串演了一幕令人作呕的兜售“和谈”阴谋的双簧。据美国新闻处报道，苏修代表罗申在二十一日的会上对美国的侵越战争装模作样地作了一番“指责”，而美国代表已经“对此作好了准备，他们并不认为这种攻击对缔结条约的前景是个威胁”。接着，美国代表福斯特在“答复”苏联代表时又重复了那一套诱压越南人民投降的滥调，说什么美国准备把这场“冲突”移到“和平”桌上来，如果“对方”提出任何“建议”的话——但是“（对方）还没有提出任何建议”。这就暴露了美帝和苏修企图利用“裁军会议”来推进它们大搞越南“和谈”阴谋的险恶居心。
    美帝和苏修在“防止核扩散”问题上加紧勾结，其矛头也是针对中国的。在中国去年连续成功地进行了核武器试验之后，它们更加迫不及待地要搞成这项交易。
    苏修宣传机器《真理报》不久前就“裁军会议”发表的一篇评论清楚地暴露了苏修在这个问题上的反华面目。这篇评论公然把伟大的社会主义中国同抱着染指核武器野心的西德军国主义统治集团相提并论，恶毒地诬蔑中国揭露美苏这个大骗局是什么“远远离开和平的利益”，妄图以此来孤立中国。
    据报道，这次“裁军会议”可能延续到今年五月。联合国十八国“裁军”委员会成员国的法国，同已往一样拒绝参加这次会议。
