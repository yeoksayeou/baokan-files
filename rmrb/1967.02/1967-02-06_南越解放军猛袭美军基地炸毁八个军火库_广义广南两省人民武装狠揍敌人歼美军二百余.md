West Saigon, February 4 - The liberation forces in the South Vietnamese province of Binh Duong launched a fierce attack on the Long Binh US logistics base early this morning, the fourth such assault. Initial reports indicate that the stationed US aggressor forces suffered casualties, with at least eight ammunition depots destroyed.

Western news agencies reported that a series of explosions began around 3:20 AM, shaking the windows of buildings in Saigon. The fires burned for eight to nine hours. Some US military officials in charge of the base admitted that this attack caused more damage than the previous three.

The Long Binh US logistics base is located about 20 kilometers northeast of Saigon and is one of the major ammunition depots of the US aggressor forces in South Vietnam. On October 28, November 17, and December 9 last year, the liberation forces in Binh Duong province had already attacked this base three times, achieving brilliant results. They killed or wounded over 350 US aggressor troops, destroyed eight ammunition depots storing a large number of bombs, shells, rockets, and explosives, and blew up 21 military vehicles and cranes.

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, February 4 - The liberation radio and liberation news agency of South Vietnam reported that the liberation forces in the provinces of Quang Ngai and Quang Nam in South Vietnam achieved many victories in several battles in January, dealing heavy blows to the enemy. On January 28, the guerrilla forces in the De Phu district of Quang Ngai province successfully repelled the "sweeping" operations launched by two battalions of US aggressor troops in the Phu Ninh commune, killing over 140 US troops.

The liberation forces in this province, in a counter-"sweeping" battle in the An Tien area in the northwest of the Son Ha district on January 10, completely annihilated two companies of South Korean puppet troops and severely wounded another company, killing 235 enemy troops on the spot.

The liberation forces in Quang Nam province, from the night of January 14 to the early morning of January 15, captured the Kun Ho outpost southeast of Da Nang, killing 131 US Marine Corps troops.
