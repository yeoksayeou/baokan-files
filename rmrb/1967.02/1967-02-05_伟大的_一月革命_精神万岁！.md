The great spirit of the "January Revolution" is long live!

Torrents surge, thunder roars. The great "January Revolution" has opened a new stage in the Cultural Revolution of our country.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord."

The "January Revolution" is the revolutionary masses uniting, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smashing all the plots and sabotage of the class enemy, and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The "January Revolution" is, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the revolutionary masses uniting, rallying all revolutionary masses, and creating new organizational forms of the state organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat that are more suitable for the socialist economic base.

The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. With state power, we have everything; without it, we lose everything. At this crucial moment of life and death, the class enemy has launched a frenzied counterattack!

They stir up superstition and kindle ghost fires, attempting to use counter-revolutionary economism to disrupt the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They confuse right and wrong, turn black into white, shift the direction of the struggle, set up a smokescreen to confuse the revolutionary ranks and fish in troubled waters. They play tricks, using the small-bourgeois enthusiasm of some people to incite reactionary anarchist trends, as a shield to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and negate the socialist system, and shamelessly label this bourgeois reactionary trend as a new thing, attempting to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

They disguise themselves as revolutionary masses, coming out in droves, waving the banner of rebellion, engaging in counter-revolutionary connections, organizing counter-revolutionary cliques, committing evil deeds, and doing as they please. If we allow these handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, these stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, these landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, these ghosts and monsters, to run amok like this, our Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will not be able to proceed, the lives and property of the people will not be guaranteed, and our power will be lost.

The great "January Revolution" is a resolute suppression of these class enemies and a powerful counterattack against the sabotage of the class enemy.

Those "preserve" reactionary organizations are also stirring. They shout loudly about wanting to seize power! Those who stubbornly preserve the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, those who stubbornly preserve the bourgeois reactionary line, are actually preserving their own former small official hats, seizing back the privileges given to them by the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In a word, they want to maintain the old order of capitalism and revisionism.

The great "January Revolution" is a kick in the pants to these "preserve" elements, making them stand aside, and seizing power into the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Intense class struggle inevitably reflects within the revolutionary ranks. Thus, windbaggery, sectarianism, and cliquism, etc., grow within some revolutionary organizations. This is the reflection of the bourgeois worldview within the ranks of the revolutionary rebels. If these erroneous tendencies are allowed to develop, they will inevitably turn to the opposite side—merging with the conservative forces and degenerating.

The great "January Revolution" criticized various opportunist viewpoints, achieved the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, organized a vast revolutionary army, and underwent new tests in the struggle for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize power.

The surging waves of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat are crashing against the entire old world. The new era of human history, the new era of the communist movement, will be created in our hands. The proletarians of the whole world are watching us. We must liberate all mankind. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat must have the spirit of pines and cypresses, the broad-mindedness of clouds and water—"She does not compete for spring, but only reports the arrival of spring. When the mountains are in full bloom, she smiles among the crowd." Open your eyes to the future, advance steadfastly. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite, occupy all positions, seize power for the proletariat! Seize power for Mao Zedong Thought! Seize power for all the oppressed and enslaved people of the world!

Long live the great spirit of the "January Revolution"!

    伟大的“一月革命”精神万岁！
    北京师范大学井冈山公社挺进大队
    激浪冲天，惊雷动地。伟大的“一月革命”开创了我国无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”
    “一月革命”就是无产阶级革命派联合起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。
      “一月革命”就是在无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级革命派联合起来，团结一切革命群众，创建更适合社会主义经济基础的无产阶级专政国家机构的新的组织形式。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题，有了政权就有了一切，丧失政权就丧失了一切。在这生死抉择的紧要关头，阶级敌人进行了何等疯狂的反扑！
    他们煽妖风，点鬼火，企图利用反革命经济主义破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们混淆是非，颠倒黑白，转移斗争的大方向，大摆迷魂阵，企图扰乱革命阵线，从中渔利。他们玩弄诡辩术，利用某些人的小资产阶级的狂热性，鼓动反动的无政府主义思潮，作为攻击无产阶级专政，否定社会主义制度的挡箭牌，并无耻地把这种资产阶级反动思潮，标榜为新生事物，企图把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。
    他们冒充革命群众，纷纷出笼，打着造反的旗号，进行反革命串连，组织反革命集团，为非作歹，为所欲为。如果听任这些党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这些极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，这些地、富、反、坏、右牛鬼蛇神，如此肆无忌惮地搞下去，我们的无产阶级文化大革命将无法进行，人民的生命财产将无法保障，我们的政权将要丧失。
    伟大的“一月革命”，正是对这些阶级敌人进行了坚决的镇压，对阶级敌人的破坏给予有力的回击。
    那些“保”字号的反动组织也蠢蠢欲动，他们吵吵嚷嚷地叫喊什么“要夺权！”那些死保党内走资本主义道路的当权派、死保资产阶级反动路线的家伙，就是要保他们自己从前的小乌纱帽，夺回他们从前党内走资本主义道路当权派给予他们的特权，一句话，他们就是要维护资本主义、修正主义的旧秩序。
    伟大的“一月革命”，正是一脚踢开了这些“保”字号的家伙，让他们靠边站，把权夺到无产阶级革命派手中。
    激烈的阶级斗争必然反映到革命队伍内部来。于是，风头主义，宗派主义，小团体主义等等，在一些革命组织内部滋长。这是资产阶级世界观在革命造反派队伍内的反映。这些错误的倾向，如果任其发展下去，他们必然要走向反面——与保守势力同流合污而变质。
    伟大的“一月革命”，批判了形形色色的机会主义观点，取得了无产阶级革命派的大联合，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，在无产阶级革命派大夺权的斗争中，经受了新的考验。
    汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮正在冲击着整个旧世界，人类历史的新纪元，共产主义运动的新纪元，将在我们手里开创。全世界无产者在望着我们，我们要解放全人类。无产阶级革命派一定要有松柏气节，云水胸襟——“俏也不争春，只把春来报。待到山花烂漫时，她在丛中笑。”放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进。在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，无产阶级革命派联合起来，占领一切阵地，为无产阶级夺权！为毛泽东思想夺权！为全世界被压迫被奴役的人民夺权！
    伟大的“一月革命”精神万岁！
