Chairman Mao is the great and wise leader of the world's people. The working people of Cyprus love Chairman Mao and praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nicosia, the working people of Cyprus hold great respect for the great leader Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

A common old worker in Cyprus said, "Mao Zedong's path is correct. Chairman Mao is the great and wise leader of the Chinese people and the world's people. This is my belief and the belief of my entire family." These words express the common feelings of the working people of Cyprus.

When the reporter stayed briefly in the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia, he felt everywhere the respect and love of the working people of Cyprus for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. As soon as people saw that we were wearing Chairman Mao badges, they immediately greeted us with respect, shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong!" Many people gave us thumbs up, saying, "Mao Zedong is very great, we respect him very much."

One taxi driver, full of love for Chairman Mao, asked us for a Chairman Mao badge and immediately proudly wore it on his chest. The next day, we met this driver again. He told us that when he returned home the previous day, his wife saw the Chairman Mao badge on his chest and excitedly shouted, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" His children also immediately gathered around him, eagerly looking at the badge of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, each wanting to wear this badge. When we gave him a second Chairman Mao badge, he said, "This is a big event for my family. I decided to give this badge to my child, so that they can walk the correct path."

One day, we went to the telegraph office, and a middle-aged man looked enviously at the Chairman Mao badges on our chests and requested that we give him a Chairman Mao badge. When his wish was fulfilled, he was very excited.

A Cypriot journalist told us that he treasures the Chairman Mao badge he obtained during his visit to China a few years ago. He said, "For me, having this Chairman Mao badge is a great honor."

The working people of Cyprus all yearn to obtain the works of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They regard these books as treasures in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and Soviet revisionism. Their longing for Mao Zedong Thought is like the parched land and crops yearning for timely rain.

The people of Cyprus enthusiastically praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They point out that the slanders of imperialists and modern revisionists against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China absolutely cannot deceive and mislead the people of Cyprus.

An old worker said, "We do not believe the lies of imperialism and revisionism slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are all professional liars."

A Cypriot intellectual said, "Chairman Mao initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening a new era for China and for the world's people."

    毛主席是世界人民伟大英明的领袖
    塞浦路斯劳动人民热爱毛主席，赞颂中国文化大革命
    据新华社尼科西亚电  塞浦路斯的劳动人民十分敬仰伟大的领袖毛主席，热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    塞浦路斯的一位普通老工人说：“毛泽东的道路是正确的。毛主席是中国人民和世界人民的伟大的英明的领袖。这是我的信念，也是我全家的信念。”这段话表达了塞浦路斯劳动人民的共同感情。
    当记者在塞浦路斯首都尼科西亚作短时间的逗留时，到处都感到塞浦路斯劳动人民对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的崇敬和热爱。人们只要看到我们胸前戴着毛主席像章，就立即怀着敬意高呼：“毛泽东！”许多人翘起大拇指说：“毛泽东非常伟大，我们十分尊敬他。”
    一位出租汽车司机满怀对毛主席的热爱，向我们要了一枚毛主席像章，并立即骄傲地戴在自己的胸前。第二天，我们又遇到这位司机。他对我们说，他前一天回到家中时，他的妻子一看到他胸前的毛主席像章就激动地欢呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”他的孩子们也马上围住他，争着看世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像章，谁都想戴上这枚像章。当我们送给他第二枚毛主席像章时，他说，这是我的家庭的一件大事，我决定把这枚像章给我的孩子，要他们走正确的道路。
    有一天，我们去电报局，一位中年人非常羡慕地看着我们胸前的毛主席像章，并请求我们送给他一枚毛主席像章。当他的愿望得到满足时，他十分激动。
    一位塞浦路斯的新闻工作者对我们说，他非常珍贵地保存着他几年前访问中国时得到的一枚毛主席像章，他说：“对我来说，有这枚毛主席像章是莫大的荣幸。”
    塞浦路斯的劳动人民都渴望得到毛主席的著作和《毛主席语录》，他们把这些书看成是同以美国为首的帝国主义和苏联修正主义进行斗争的宝书。他们对毛泽东思想的渴望正象久旱的土地和庄稼渴望及时雨一样。
    塞浦路斯人民热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，他们指出，帝国主义者和现代修正主义者对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诽谤，绝对欺骗和迷惑不了塞浦路斯人民。
    一位老工人说，我们不相信帝国主义和修正主义诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命的胡言乱语，他们都是说谎专家。
    一位塞浦路斯知识分子说：“毛主席发动了无产阶级文化大革命，为中国也为世界人民开创了新的纪元。”
