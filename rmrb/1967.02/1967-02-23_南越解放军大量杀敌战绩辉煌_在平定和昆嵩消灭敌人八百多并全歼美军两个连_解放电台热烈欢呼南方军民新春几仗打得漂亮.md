HANOI, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- According to reports from the Liberation News Agency and Liberation Radio Station of South Vietnam, the liberation armed forces in the provinces of Binh Dinh and Kontum recently achieved great victories in their attacks against the enemy, annihilating a total of 850 enemy soldiers and completely wiping out two companies of American invaders.

From Jan. 27 to Feb. 7, the liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province continuously smashed the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operations and launched fierce attacks on the De Thuy enemy base, annihilating a total of 850 enemy soldiers, including 550 American invaders. They also shot down, destroyed, and damaged 67 helicopters.

In the early hours of Feb. 7, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on the newly built De Thuy military base of the American puppet forces, targeting the airport, American artillery positions, and the command post of the 40th Regiment of the puppet forces.

The accurate artillery fire of the liberation armed forces frequently hit the targets, rendering 25 enemy cannons completely useless. The enemy aircraft parked at the airport and the nearby fuel depots were also hit and set on fire. As the artillery shells of the liberation armed forces rained down on the enemy, the brave assault troops quickly launched a fierce attack on the positions of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and the puppet forces, routing four battalions of American puppet forces.

According to preliminary reports, in this brilliant attack, the liberation armed forces destroyed and damaged 50 enemy helicopters, destroyed three cannons, burned down two fuel depots, and annihilated 350 enemy soldiers, including 200 American invaders.

On Feb. 15 and 17, the liberation armed forces in Kontum Province fought a brilliant battle in the Sa Thay River area. In these two days, they launched fierce attacks on two American positions and bravely intercepted the American reinforcements.

In the battle, they completely wiped out two companies of American invaders, severely injured another two companies, shot down eight helicopters, destroyed two military vehicles, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

HANOI, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Radio Station of South Vietnam recently issued a commentary, enthusiastically applauding the South Vietnamese military and civilians for taking the initiative in continuously attacking the enemy, hoisting the banner of decisive battle and victory against the American aggressors, and achieving brilliant victories in the early spring.

The commentary said that the liberation armed forces, with their fiery fighting spirit, have defeated the enemy in several engagements. They not only achieved great merits in smashing the enemy's "sweeping" operations but also deeply penetrated into the enemy's lairs, delivering thunderous blows. The main forces of the liberation armed forces fought well, and the local forces and guerrilla units also fought well.

The commentary pointed out that the victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians in the early spring demonstrated their decisive power to win the battle, embodying their unwavering resolve to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country.

The South Vietnamese military and civilians have demonstrated the mighty power of people's war, fighting independently in each village. They have fought and won repeatedly, making the American aggressors have nowhere to hide.
