Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Politburo member, Deputy Premier and Minister of Defense Beqir Balluku and the Albanian military delegation he led, were accompanied today by CPC Central Committee member and Deputy Minister of Defense Wang Shusheng, and relevant officials Chen Shigang, Song Chengzhi, and Pan Zhenwu, to watch a demolition demonstration by the Engineering Corps of the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They were warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers.

When the Albanian comrades arrived at the exercise site, the officers and soldiers beat drums and waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans such as "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Comrade Balluku also enthusiastically shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Amidst the cheers, a group of PLA soldiers stepped out of the welcoming line and pinned their beloved Chairman Mao badges on the chests of Balluku and other Albanian comrades.

After the exercise, Comrade Balluku gave an enthusiastic speech, warmly praising the achievements of this unit in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Only officers and soldiers like you, who are inspired by Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics, can perform such splendid demonstrations." He said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful tool of proletarian dictatorship armed with Mao Zedong Thought. It has a blood-and-flesh connection with the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and especially with Comrade Mao Zedong, and is ruthless towards the enemy."

Comrade Balluku said, "We are particularly pleased to see you actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a great school for learning Mao Zedong Thought, a great school and furnace for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Comrade Balluku said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong is a great contribution to the revolutionary theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism. This revolution has profound significance for the international proletarian revolutionary movement. All Marxist-Leninists should learn from this revolution."

After the speech, Comrade Balluku shouted in Chinese, "Long live the PLA! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The officers and soldiers also enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" The entire exercise site was filled with the atmosphere of combat friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries.

    巴卢库同志赞扬我解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    文化大革命是学习毛泽东思想大学校
    新华社三十一日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和他率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团，今天，由中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声和有关方面的负责人陈士榘、宋承志、潘振武等陪同，观看了中国人民解放军北京部队工程兵某部的爆破表演，受到了指战员们的热烈欢迎。
    当阿尔巴尼亚同志来到演习场地时，指战员们敲锣打鼓，挥动着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，高呼“中阿友谊万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”巴卢库同志也热情地用中国话高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”欢呼声中，一群解放军战士走出欢迎行列，把心爱的毛主席像章别在巴卢库和其他阿尔巴尼亚同志的胸前。
    演习结束时，巴卢库同志作了热情洋溢的讲话，热烈赞扬这个部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗所取得的成就。他说，只有象你们这样在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下突出无产阶级政治的干部战士，才能作出这样精彩的表演。他说，中国人民解放军，是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的强大的无产阶级专政工具。它同中国人民、中国共产党，特别是同毛泽东同志，有着血肉相连的联系，而对敌人是冷酷无情的。
    巴卢库同志说，我们特别高兴地看到你们积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经成为学习毛泽东思想的大学校，成为培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人的大学校和大熔炉。
    巴卢库同志说，毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，是对马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命实践的伟大贡献。这场革命对国际无产阶级革命运动有着深远的意义。所有马克思列宁主义者，都应该学习这场革命。
    讲话后，巴卢库同志用中国话高呼：“解放军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”指战员们也热烈高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”整个演习场充满着中阿两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊的气氛。
