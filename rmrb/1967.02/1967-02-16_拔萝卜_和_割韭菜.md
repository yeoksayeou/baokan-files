	“Uprooting Radishes” and “Cutting Leeks”
	Li Shi
	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must not only overthrow the bourgeoisie but also overthrow the selfish thoughts in our own minds. The more thorough the self-revolution to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, the more thorough we can be in overthrowing the bourgeoisie. However, when conducting the self-revolution to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, there are often two completely different attitudes.

	One attitude is to follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, to always place oneself on the starting line of ideological reform, achieving transparency in revealing one’s thoughts, fighting fiercely, and changing rapidly. It is like uprooting radishes, pulling out the selfish thoughts root and stem, without leaving any mud or half-removed roots. Many revolutionary pioneers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the face of severe class struggle, why were they able to dare to climb mountains of swords and walk through seas of fire, “willing to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse”? Why were they able to insist on the truth and resolutely expose and criticize the crimes of those within the party who take the capitalist road and stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line? It is because they always remember Chairman Mao’s teachings, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly breaking down the “self” and firmly establishing the “public,” sweeping away non-proletarian thoughts deep in the soul; daring to confront the “self” in close combat, engaging in a battle of annihilation; even if it is a fleeting selfish thought, they will not let it pass, but will pursue and attack it relentlessly, completely eliminating it. In this way, after driving the “self” out of the door, the “public” will naturally take root and settle in. The communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, who is dedicated to the public, once said: “Selfish thoughts must be fiercely fought,” and “selfishness must be deeply uprooted,” which also illustrates this principle.

	Another attitude is to reveal thoughts out of fear of appearing ugly, to fight errors out of fear of pain, lacking the determination for self-reform. They always find various excuses, being stubborn on the outside but soft on the inside, evasive and hesitant, with the word “fear” at the forefront, not daring to cut off their tails, resulting in their erroneous thoughts being like cutting leeks, cutting one batch after another, unable to uproot them. The black roots of bourgeois ideology cannot be removed, and the roots of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be firmly established. Therefore, in the Cultural Revolution, they will inevitably continue to make mistakes and fall.

	To break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness in the depths of the soul, to reform the bourgeois worldview, is indeed a long-term task. However, we must not be complacent because of this. We must, with the revolutionary spirit of “seizing the day,” fiercely uproot the roots of revisionism, and advocate for annihilation battles like “uprooting radishes,” correcting mistakes immediately, fiercely fighting against “self,” and uprooting the roots of bourgeois ideology in our minds. We should not be like “cutting leeks,” not uprooting the roots of errors, resulting in endless troubles.

	Only those without selfishness can be fearless. By discarding the “self,” we can, in the current sharp and complex great battle against those within the party who take the capitalist road, distinguish the direction and become warriors who are both wise and brave.

    “拔萝卜”和“割韭菜”
    李世
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，既要革资产阶级的命，也要革自己头脑中私心杂念的命。破私立公的自我革命搞得越彻底，就越能彻底地革资产阶级的命。然而，进行破私立公的自我革命，往往有两种完全不同的态度。
    一种，是遵照毛主席的教导，把自己经常放在思想改造的起跑线上，做到了亮思想亮得透，斗也斗得狠，改也改得快，就跟拔萝卜一样，把私心杂念连根带梢一起拔掉，不拖泥带水留半截。无产阶级文化大革命中许许多多的革命闯将，在阶级斗争严峻考验的时刻，为什么能够刀山敢上，火海敢闯，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”？为什么敢于坚持真理，坚决揭发批判党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的罪行？就是因为他们时刻记住毛主席的教导，用毛泽东思想作武器，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，横扫灵魂深处的非无产阶级思想；敢于和“私”字短兵相接，刺刀见红，打歼灭战；哪怕是一闪而过的私心杂念，也不放过，也要穷追猛打，彻底消灭。这样，把“私”字彻底扫地出门了，“公”字当然就会安家落户了。一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥曾说：“私心杂念要猛斗”，“私心要狠挖”，也同样说明了这样一个道理。
    另一种态度，是亮思想怕丑，斗错误怕疼，缺乏自我改造的决心。他们总是找出种种借口，口硬心软，躲躲闪闪，“怕”字当头，下不了狠心割尾巴，结果，他们的错误思想也就象割韭菜，割了一茬又一茬，不能连根拔。资产阶级思想的黑根子挖不掉，毛泽东思想的根子扎不牢，因此在文化大革命中，他们也就不可避免地要继续犯错误，跌交子。
    在灵魂深处破私立公，改造资产阶级世界观，固然是一个长期任务。但是我们绝不能因此而安然自得。既要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，狠刨修正主义的根子，又要提倡打“拔萝卜”式的歼灭战，知错就改，狠斗“私”字，挖自己脑子里的资产阶级思想的根子。而不要象“割韭菜”那样，不把错误的根子挖出来，以致弄得后患无穷。
    唯无私者才能无畏。丢掉了“私”字，我们就能够在当前同党内走资本主义道路的当权派进行的一场尖锐、复杂的大决战中，辨明方向，做一个智勇双全的战士。
