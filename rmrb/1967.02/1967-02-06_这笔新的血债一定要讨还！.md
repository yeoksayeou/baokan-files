Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces..."

	The Dark Hand Reaching Out

	At 18:50 on February 3, the already gloomy sky of Moscow darkened further. Four trucks covered with tarpaulins and two sedans suddenly arrived in front of the "Friendship" Road Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union. The Soviet police responsible for "guarding" the embassy waved to the vehicles, and about 160-170 burly men jumped out of the trucks and rushed towards the embassy's news picture display window. These thugs sneaked over the embassy's front yard fence, which was over a meter high, and once inside the embassy's premises, they hurriedly started to dismantle the Chinese embassy's news picture display window.

	The Soviet revisionist hooligans' act of fascist violence was meticulously planned. They took advantage of the fact that part of the embassy staff had gone to the station to see off Chinese students returning home and had not yet returned to the embassy. They used the cover of night to commit this horrifying anti-China violence. Some of the thugs used electric saws and axes to destroy the display window, while the rest guarded the ends of the sidewalk. When embassy staff rushed to the display window upon hearing the news, the thugs pushed and blocked them, punching and kicking them.

	There were about ten Soviet revisionist police on the scene. Their supposed responsibility was to "guard" the embassy, but during the half hour that these Soviet revisionist thugs were beating up our embassy staff, they not only did not stop the thugs from violating the embassy's sovereignty and brutally beating Chinese diplomatic personnel, but they also assisted the thugs in blocking embassy staff who went to reason with them, and participated in the violence.

	On this "Friendship" Road in Moscow, within the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, the plainclothes agents and thugs sent by the Soviet government went berserk, beating up our diplomatic personnel, causing another serious anti-China bloodshed incident. This is a new debt of blood that the Soviet revisionist leadership owes to the Chinese people!

	The Chinese People Are Not to Be Insulted

	Inside our embassy's display window, there were pictures of our great leader Chairman Mao inspecting the great proletarian cultural revolution army, and pictures recording the bloody suppression of our students by Soviet military police and secret agents. Could the Chinese diplomatic personnel, who are loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, stand by and watch the black hands of Soviet revisionist thugs defile the most red, most red sun in their hearts, their most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's photo? Could they tolerate this gang of fascist thugs running amok in the Chinese embassy? No! No! A thousand times no! A million times no! Faced with the fascist violence of the Soviet revisionist thugs, they stood up and, disregarding their own safety, fought resolutely to defend the dignity of our socialist motherland, which is under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They engaged in a firm struggle of reason with these heartless and insane gangsters.

	Our embassy's acting charge d'affaires, An Zhi Yuan, and second secretary Wang Jian Qing went up to the display window and sternly pointed out to the Soviet revisionist thugs that their actions trampled on the most basic principles of international relations and violated the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese embassy. Before An Zhi Yuan, the acting charge d'affaires, could finish speaking, the thugs punched him in the head. One thug even raised an axe to strike An Zhi Yuan. Wang Jian Qing immediately bravely shielded An Zhi Yuan with his body. At this moment, several thugs immediately surrounded Wang Jian Qing, pushed him to the ground, twisted his right leg, and punched and kicked him, causing him to bleed from his mouth and nose. Our embassy staff, Wang Zhuo Xian, Wang Gui Hai, Li Wei Zhong, Jia Qian Cheng, Zhang Guang You, Yu Yi Wei, Yu Yu Huan, Meng Zhao Gang, Gao Gui, Cui Wei, Wang Qi Bin, and New China News Agency staff member Zhou Yu Kang, a total of 31 people, were all beaten by the thugs for going to protect the display window. Seven of them were beaten so badly that they bled, some had their faces and ears swollen, and some had their glasses broken. The *People's Daily* reporter, Xie Wen Qing, who was on the scene, was pushed down from a more than one-meter-high step by the thugs, fell to the ground, and his right leg swelled. At this time, another thug kicked his lower abdomen hard. Xie Wen Qing's camera was broken, and his flashlight was snatched away. Our commercial counselor, Cai Xin De, saw that Xie Wen Qing was in danger and went to help him, but the thugs immediately knocked Cai Xin De to the ground and stomped on his chest several times. The New China News Agency reporter, Ding Xiang Qi, also had his head struck by the thugs. The fascist thugs did not even spare the female comrades. Our embassy's female comrades, Yang Xian Zhen, Jiang Ai Mei, and Jiang Duo Lin, were also beaten.

	Thirty-one Chinese comrades, surrounded and beaten by 160-170 Soviet revisionist thugs, fearlessly and unyieldingly persisted in their struggle. They demonstrated the great courage of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and they are truly red diplomatic workers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought!

	So Cowardly

	The fascist thugs raised by the Soviet government were so ferocious on the surface, but they were cowardly at heart. Like ghosts that cannot bear the light of day, they committed these shameful deeds in the evening and at night.

	The winter in Moscow is short, and it gets dark at around 16:00. The Soviet authorities chose to act at 18:50, fearing that the Soviet people would see their true colors and that reporters would take photos of their shameful crimes. The thugs, in their haste, used saws to cut the display window's supports in half and then loaded the window onto a truck and drove away. Later, they discovered that this crime was not cleanly executed, leaving half a support pillar buried in the ground, which could still be photographed by reporters and exposed. So, a few hours later, the thugs, under the command of police cars, sneaked into the embassy's front yard fence four more times, trying to saw off the remaining half of the display window support pillar and completely cover their tracks.

	At 2:20 on the fourth, more than ten Soviet revisionist special agents and thugs rushed into our embassy, carrying saws to try to saw off the remaining part of the display window's wooden post. Our embassy staff immediately discovered this and shouted, "Down with modern revisionism! Down with the fascists!" These special agents and thugs, fearing exposure, sawed off one wooden post and then fled in disarray.

	Our embassy staff immediately questioned the Soviet police responsible for "guarding" them, who could not deny the ironclad facts and only said, "Go to the Foreign Ministry."

	At 4:08, this group of Soviet revisionist thugs came again to cut the wooden posts, with police cars protecting them, but they were discovered by our embassy staff, rebuked, and fled.

	At 4:35, the Soviet revisionist thugs, under the command of the police, attacked our embassy again, trying to cut down the remaining wooden posts, but they failed.

	At 6:00, the thugs launched another attack on our embassy. Our embassy staff sternly rebuked them, but they insisted on continuing to cut down the remaining wooden posts in our embassy. Our embassy staff, risking their lives, engaged in a more than ten-minute struggle of reason with them, and this group of thugs was forced to retreat from the embassy.

	Oh, the pathetic and pitiful Soviet revisionist masters, look at yourselves in the mirror! How ugly you are! You claim to be doing something grand and righteous, so why do you have to act in the dead of night? Why are you so afraid of being photographed? And why can't you wait until the next day to remove the half support pillar of the display window? The evidence is irrefutable, and you will never be able to escape your crimes!

	The Light of Truth Cannot Be Blocked

	The Soviet revisionist masters in the Kremlin, for the sake of six display windows, mobilized a large number of thugs and made a big fuss. Why is this? Only by stripping off the skin of these revisionist elements can we find the answer.

	The six display windows exhibited pictures that embody the brilliance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, reflect the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, reveal the true situation of the "January 25" Red Square bloodshed incident, and powerfully refute the slanders and lies of the Soviet revisionist leadership, exposing their treacherous faces. The Soviet authorities are terrified of these pictures and have always regarded them as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their hearts.

	The pictures of the "Red Square bloodshed incident" exhibited this time were on display from 15:10 on January 28 to 18:50 on February 3, when they were forcibly destroyed and stolen by special agents and thugs sent by the Soviet authorities, for a total of six days, three hours, and forty minutes. These pictures were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Soviet people, with nearly a thousand people coming to see them every day. Among them were elderly people over seventy, primary school students aged seven or eight, workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Over the past few days, especially on January 29 (Sunday), the number of people coming to see the pictures was even more enthusiastic, sometimes with three rows of people watching at the same time. Some people watched a second time after watching once, some people came back to watch after being dispersed by the police. Some people even took taxis from far away to come and watch. An elderly woman stood for a long time in front of the display window, looking back and forth. When she saw the pictures of Chinese students being beaten by Soviet military police and secret agents in Red Square, tears welled up in her eyes, and she wiped them away with her sleeve.

	These scenes made the Soviet revisionist masters tremble with fear. They had sent a large number of police and special agents to take turns on duty in front of the display window, dispersing ordinary Soviet people who came to see the pictures. These police, under orders from their superiors, surrounded the Chinese embassy and tried to isolate it from the outside world. Their police cars were almost always on alert.

	Through the various activities of the police and special agents densely deployed on "Friendship" Road, one can see the treacherous faces of the small group of revisionist masters hiding in the Kremlin. They have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the great Lenin, and betrayed the Soviet people; they are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought and afraid that the Soviet people will master the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought and rise up to overthrow them and rebel against them. They have already reached the point of wanting to eliminate these six picture display windows at all costs. It is truly pathetic and lamentable!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "I say that all the reactionaries are paper tigers. Why? Because they are detached from the people." He also says, "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese idiom describing the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools." Listen, you miserable creatures of the Soviet revisionist leadership, these two great judgments of Chairman Mao are also a portrayal of your ugly faces. You are just a bunch of paper tigers detached from the people, a group of fools who "lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet." The more evil deeds you do, the more the Soviet people will see through your reactionary nature. The day when the Soviet people rise up to rebel against you is not far off! Your fate of complete ruin is inevitable.

### 这笔新的血债一定要讨还！

    这笔新的血债一定要讨还！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的……”
      黑暗里伸来的魔手
    二月三日十八时五十分，阴暗的莫斯科天色更加黯淡。四辆盖着油布的卡车和两辆小轿车突然开到了“友谊”路中国驻苏联大使馆前面。负责“守卫”大使馆的苏联警察向车上一招手，一百六、七十名彪形大汉就从车上跳下，直奔大使馆的新闻图片橱窗。这些家伙鬼鬼祟祟地闯过使馆前院的一米多高的围栏，到了大使馆的范围内，立即慌慌张张动手拆除中国大使馆的新闻图片橱窗。
    苏修暴徒们制造这一法西斯暴行完全是经过周密策划的。他们趁中国大使馆部分人员前往车站欢送回国的中国留学生尚未返回大使馆的时机，利用夜幕制造骇人听闻的反华暴行。这些暴徒一部分人用电锯和利斧破坏橱窗，其余的人分头把守在人行道两端。当我使馆人员闻讯赶到橱窗时，恶棍们就猛推硬阻，挥拳毒打。
    有十几个苏修警察在场，他们的责任据说是“守卫”大使馆的，但在这批苏修暴徒毒打我使馆人员约半个钟头的时间里，他们不但不制止暴徒们侵犯使馆主权，毒打中国外交人员的残暴兽行，反而协助暴徒阻挡前往说理劝阻的使馆人员，并且参与暴行。
    在莫斯科这条名叫“友谊”的路上，在中国驻苏联大使馆内，苏联政府指使的便衣特务和暴徒们丧心病狂，毒打我国外交人员，造成了又一次的严重反华流血事件，这是苏修领导集团对中国人民欠下的一笔新的血债！
        中华儿女不可侮
    在我大使馆图片橱窗里，陈列着我们伟大的领袖毛主席检阅无产阶级文化大革命大军的图片，陈列着记录苏联军警特务血腥镇压我国留学生暴行的图片。忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想的中国外交人员能够眼看着苏修暴徒的黑手沾污他们心中最红最红的红太阳、最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的照片吗？能够容忍这帮法西斯暴徒在中国大使馆内恣意逞凶吗？不行！不行！一千个不行！一万个不行！面对苏修暴徒的法西斯暴行，他们挺身而出不顾生命危险，为了捍卫伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义祖国的尊严，同这帮丧心病狂的家伙进行了坚决的说理斗争。
    我国驻苏大使馆临时代办安致远同二等秘书王荩卿一起走近橱窗向苏修暴徒严正指出，他们的暴行践踏了最起码的国际关系准则，侵犯了中国大使馆的外交特权。安致远临时代办的话还没有讲完，暴徒们就挥拳猛击他的头部，一个暴徒竟然举起斧头要砍安致远临时代办。王荩卿同志立刻奋勇以身掩护安致远同志。这时，几个歹徒马上包围了王荩卿同志，把他按在地上，扭着他的右腿拳打脚踢，打得他口鼻流血。我使馆工作人员王钊贤、王贵海、李维忠、贾潜成、张广有、余义维、余俞焕、孟昭庚、高贵、崔嵬、王其斌以及新华社工作人员周裕康等三十一人都因前去保卫橱窗而被暴徒们殴打。有七人被毒打得流血，有的脸和耳朵被打肿，有的眼镜被打碎。在场采访的《人民日报》记者谢文清被暴徒从一米多高的台阶上猛推下去，倒在地上，右腿被摔发肿。这时又有暴徒就势用脚狠踢他的下腹部。谢文清同志的照相机被打坏，闪光灯也被抢走。我商务参赞蔡新德同志一见谢文清处境危急，便前去救扶，可是暴徒们又立刻把蔡新德打倒在地，并在他的胸膛上使劲踩了几脚。新华社记者丁翔起头部也遭到暴徒们的猛击。法西斯暴徒们连女同志也不放过。我使馆女同志杨先珍、姜爱梅、凃多琳三人也遭到了毒打。
    中国同志三十一人在受到苏修暴徒一百六、七十人包围毒打的情况下，不畏强暴，英勇不屈，坚持斗争。他们表现了以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的大无畏的英勇气概，他们不愧为在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的红色外交工作人员！
      如此做贼心虚
    苏联政府豢养的这群法西斯暴徒表面上是如此凶狠，但骨子里却是作贼心虚。象见不得阳光的魔鬼，在傍晚和黑夜，干出这种见不得人的丑恶的勾当。
    莫斯科的冬天，白昼是比较短的，十六时就天色昏暗。苏联当局选择在十八时五十分动手抢劫，一怕苏联人民知道他们的贼相，二怕人们拍下他们的丑恶罪行的照片。暴徒们在匆忙中，用锯子把橱窗的支柱拦腰锯断后，就把橱窗装上卡车拉走。随后，他们又发现，这件贼案干得并不干净利落，还留下有半截橱窗支柱埋在地里，这仍可能让记者拍照揭露。于是，过了几个小时，暴徒们又连续四次在警车指挥下偷偷摸摸溜进大使馆的前院围栏内，企图把余下的半截橱窗支柱连根锯掉，彻底灭迹。
    四日凌晨二时二十分，十几名苏修特务和暴徒又冲进我大使馆，带着手锯企图锯掉剩下的橱窗最下部分的木桩。我使馆人员立即发现了，他们高呼“打倒现代修正主义！”“打倒法西斯分子！”这些特务和暴徒作贼心虚，锯去一根木桩后，即狼狈逃窜。
    我使馆工作人员当即向在场的苏联负责“守卫”警察提出严厉质问，他们无法否认铁一般的事实，只是说：“请去找外交部”。
    四时零八分，这批苏修暴徒又来砍木桩，旁边有警车保护，又被我使馆人员发现，遭到痛斥后溜走。
    四时三十五分，苏修暴徒在警察指挥下，又一次袭击我使馆，企图砍掉剩下的几根木桩，但未得逞。
    六时整，暴徒重新对我使馆发动了进攻。我使馆人员严词痛斥，但他们一意孤行，企图继续在我使馆蛮横无理地砍掉剩下的木桩，但我国使馆人员冒着生命危险，同他们展开了十多分钟的说理斗争，这群暴徒被迫退出使馆。
    可悲而又可怜的苏修老爷们，请你们拿镜子照照你们的嘴脸吧！该是多么龌龊呀！你们不是说你们干的是冠冕堂皇、正大光明的事吗？那么，你们为什么要深夜行劫呢？你们为什么那么怕拍照呢？又为什么连橱窗的半截支柱也要连夜连根拔除，而不能等到第二天呢？铁证如山，你们企图逃脱罪责，那是绝对办不到的！
      挡不住真理的阳光
    克里姆林宫的苏修老爷们，为了对付六个图片橱窗，竟然出动大批打手，大动干戈。这究竟是为什么呢？只有剥开这帮修正主义分子的画皮才能找到答案。
    这六个图片橱窗展出的图片体现了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉，反映了中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，揭示了“一·二五”红场流血事件的真实情况，有力地驳斥了苏修领导集团的诽谤、谎言，揭出了他们的丑恶的叛徒嘴脸。苏修当局对这些图片怕得要死，一直把这些图片看做是眼中钉，肉中刺。
    这次展出的“红场流血事件”的图片，自一月二十八日下午三点十分展出，到二月三日下午六点五十分被苏修当局指使的特务和暴徒强行砸坏并劫走为止，共展出了六天又三小时四十分钟。这些图片受到了苏联广大人民的热烈欢迎，每天差不多都有一千余人前往观看，他们当中有七十多岁的老人，有七、八岁的小学生，有工人，有农民，也有知识分子。几天来，特别是一月二十九日（星期日），前来看图片的更是踊跃，有时前后三排同时观看。有人看过一遍后再看第二遍，有人被警察驱散后再回去看。也有人从远处乘出租汽车赶来观看。有一位老年妇女久久地在橱窗前来回看，当她看到中国留学生在红场上遭到苏修军警毒打的图片时，泪水盈眶，用袖子去擦流下的眼泪。
    这些情景使苏修老爷们胆战心惊。他们曾经派出大批警察和特务轮流在橱窗前值班，驱散前来观看图片的普通苏联人。这些警察奉上级之命，把中国使馆包围起来，企图把它同外界隔绝。他们的警车几乎随时处于戒备状态。
    透过密布在“友谊”路上的警察、特务的种种活动，可以看清躲在克里姆林宫里的一小撮修正主义老爷们的叛徒嘴脸。他们背叛了马克思列宁主义、背叛了伟大的列宁、背叛了苏联人民；他们害怕毛泽东思想、害怕苏联人民掌握了光辉的毛泽东思想，起来革他们的命，造他们的反。他们已经害怕到了对这六块图片橱窗也必欲除之而后快的程度。真是可悲而又可叹！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我说一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。原因是他们脱离人民。”他又说“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏联修正主义领导集团的可怜虫们听着，毛主席这两段伟大的论断也是你们丑恶嘴脸的写照。你们就是这样一批脱离人民的纸老虎，就是一群“搬起石头打自己的脚”的蠢人。你们干的坏事越多，苏联人民就越清楚地看透你们反动的本质。苏联人民起来造你们的反的日子不远了！你们彻底完蛋的命运是逃脱不了的。
