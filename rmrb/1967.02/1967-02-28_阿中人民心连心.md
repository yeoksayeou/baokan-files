Our friends are everywhere in the world.
The hearts of Albanian and Chinese peoples are united.

Among the heroic Albanian people, there are many poems that enthusiastically praise the friendship between China and Albania. Here we publish one of them. May the Chinese people—our lifelong comrades—stand tall and firm like mountains for eternity! Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour have chosen true friends, and our people are overjoyed. We vow to share life and death with our friends, and we are willing to share joys and sorrows with our friends. We feel infinite happiness and honor to have true friends. The hearts of the peoples of Albania and China are connected. In the struggle against our common enemies, we will always stand shoulder to shoulder. The peoples of Albania and China, galloping on the great road to communism, will surely bury imperialism and revisionism! Let us shout together: Long live Mao Zedong and Enver!
