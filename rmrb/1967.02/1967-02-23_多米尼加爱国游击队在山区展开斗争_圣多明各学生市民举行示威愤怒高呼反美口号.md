The brave people of the Dominican Republic, undeterred by the brutal rule and bloody suppression of American imperialism and its puppet, the Balaguer dictatorship, have steadfastly continued their struggle for national liberation and democracy.

Since the large-scale anti-American patriotic armed uprising began in April 1965, which was temporarily suppressed by the direct intervention of a large number of American invading troops, the revolutionary forces of the Dominican Republic, after a period of preparation and consolidation, have recently resumed armed struggle activities.

According to a report by the Dominican Republic's *Nacional* newspaper on the 12th, Dominican guerrillas clashed with government troops in the mountainous region of San José de Ocoa, about 250 kilometers from the capital. Enrique Pérez, the Dominican Minister of Defense, admitted that many guerrilla groups are preparing to wage armed struggle against the government in the mountains. Reports indicate that there are also guerrilla bases in the regions of Bonao and Manaclara in the western part of the country, where peasants are training in guerrilla tactics.

The people of the Dominican Republic are enthusiastically supporting the brave guerrilla fighters. After hearing the news that a young guerrilla leader, Orlando Masara, had been martyred in battle, thousands of people gathered in the capital, Santo Domingo, on the 14th to hold a funeral for him, defying the bloody suppression by the military police.

In the cities, the people of the Dominican Republic have also recently launched continuous mass struggles against American imperialism and the dictatorship. On February 10th, students in the capital shouted slogans such as "Down with the dictatorship," "Against suppression," and "American imperialists, get out!" and held demonstrations in the city center and other areas to commemorate the students who were brutally killed in a fierce anti-American demonstration on February 9th of the previous year. The demonstrators bravely fought against the police who were suppressing them.

Since January of this year, students and teachers in Santo Domingo and some inland cities have been continuously holding strikes and boycotts, demanding the removal of the Minister of Education who faithfully implements the reactionary government's suppression policies, and protesting against the dismissal of teachers and the expulsion of students by the authorities. Seventy percent of the students in Santo Domingo have participated in this strike struggle.

The rekindling of armed struggle by the people of the Dominican Republic and the development of mass struggles are a signal. It shows the unshakable determination of the Dominican people to struggle against the rule of American imperialism and the reactionary government of their own country. It shows that the brutal suppression and persecution by American imperialism and the Dominican reactionaries can only further arouse the resistance of the Dominican people.

    多米尼加爱国游击队在山区展开斗争
    圣多明各学生市民举行示威愤怒高呼反美口号
    新华社二十日讯　英勇的多米尼加人民不顾美帝国主义及其走狗巴拉格独裁政权的残暴统治和血腥镇压，始终不渝地坚持争取民族解放、争取民主的顽强斗争。
    从一九六五年四月开始的大规模反美爱国武装起义，由于大量美国侵略军的直接镇压遭到暂时失败以后，多米尼加的革命力量经过一段时期的酝酿与准备，最近又重新展开了武装斗争的活动。
    据多米尼加《民族报》十二日报道，多米尼加游击队同政府军在距离首都约二百五十公里的圣何塞德奥科亚山区发生战斗。多米尼加国防部长恩里克·佩雷斯承认，有许多游击小组正准备在山区举行反政府的武装斗争。据报道，在西巴奥地区的博纳奥和马纳克拉也有反政府游击队的据点，那里的农民正进行游击战术的训练。
    多米尼加人民对英勇的游击战士是热情支持的。首都圣多明各公众听到游击队一名青年领导人奥尔兰多·马萨拉在战斗中牺牲的消息后，在十四日有好几千人集合起来，不顾军警的血腥镇压，为他举行葬礼。
    在城市里，多米尼加人民最近也连续开展了反美反独裁的群众斗争。二月十日，首都的学生高呼着“打倒独裁统治”、“反对镇压”、“美帝国主义滚出去”等口号，在市中心和其他地区举行示威，纪念去年二月九日在一次激烈的反美示威中被野蛮杀害的学生。示威者同镇压他们的警察进行了英勇的斗争。
    圣多明各和内地一些城市的学生和教师从今年一月份以来不断举行罢课罢教，要求把忠实执行反动政府镇压政策的教育部长撤职，并且抗议当局无理解雇教师和开除学生。圣多明各百分之七十的学生都投入这次罢课斗争。
    多米尼加人民武装斗争烈火的重燃和群众斗争的展开是一个信号，它表明多米尼加人民为摆脱美帝国主义和本国反动政府的统治而斗争的坚定不移的决心，表明美帝国主义和多米尼加反动派的残酷镇压和迫害只能更加激起多米尼加人民的反抗。
