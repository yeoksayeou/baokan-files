Nearly 100 Japanese friends from the trade sector in Beijing issued a statement today, pointing out: "The fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists are a challenge to the great Chinese people who are leading the worldwide struggle against imperialism and revisionism. This is also a challenge to all the people of the world, including the Japanese people."

This statement was passed at a meeting held by these Japanese friends to condemn the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in bloodily suppressing Chinese students. Five Chinese students who were persecuted by the Soviet authorities were invited to attend the meeting. When they arrived at the venue, the Japanese friends all stood up and applauded for a long time, expressing their respect to the brave anti-revisionist fighters.

The atmosphere in the venue was filled with the strong spirit of unity between the revolutionary peoples of China and Japan in their joint struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The central curtain on the stage was adorned with a portrait of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao. The venue was decorated with large banners in Japanese: "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan forged in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!"

Smallin Ryoji from the Japanese company Tohoku Butsu and Suzuki Kenjiro from the Japanese Trade Federation spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the bloody suppression in Moscow is a desperate attack and a new counteroffensive by a small group of reactionary forces worldwide who are afraid of the great proletarian cultural revolution being successfully carried out by the Chinese people and the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time—Mao Zedong Thought. They warned the Soviet fascist thugs: It is you who will inevitably be cast off the stage of history.

They said that the struggle against imperialism and revisionism is a common task for the peoples of China and Japan. We are convinced that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can we achieve victory in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The revolutionary people of Japan will study Chairman Mao's thoughts even more diligently and raise high the banner of the Japanese people's struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

Japanese peace activist Nishisonji Koji also attended the meeting and spoke. He said that the victory of the Chinese students' struggle against revisionism has greatly inspired the Japanese people. The peoples of China and Japan will be even more united in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism. He also enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people!"

Chinese student Lu Kequan was invited to speak at the meeting. She strongly denounced the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists to the Japanese friends and introduced their victorious struggle. When she spoke about their boundless love for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and their determination to fight fearlessly, even to the point of beheading and bloodshed, to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese friends applauded enthusiastically.

At the end of the meeting, everyone stood up and shouted slogans, and sang "The East Is Red" in Chinese.

    坚决保卫毛泽东思想  打退苏修疯狂新反扑
    在北京的日本朋友集会谴责苏修法西斯暴行
    新华社四日讯　近百名在北京的日本友好贸易界人士今天在一项声明中指出：“苏联修正主义者的法西斯暴行，是对高举反帝反修旗帜、站在全世界人民前头战斗的伟大中国人民的挑战，也是对包括我们日本人民在内的全世界人民的挑战。”
    这项声明是这些日本人士为谴责苏联修正主义统治集团血腥镇压中国留学生的法西斯暴行而举行的集会上通过的。受苏修当局迫害的我国五名留欧学生应邀出席集会。当他们来到会场时，日本朋友全体起立，长时间地鼓掌，向英勇的反修战士致以敬意。
    会场充满中日两国革命人民团结一致反帝反修的强烈气氛。主席台帷幕中央悬挂着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席画像，会场上悬挂着用日文写的巨幅标语：“在反帝反修斗争中结成的日中两国人民战斗友谊万岁！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”
    日本东工物产公司的小林隆治、日本贸易协同联合的铃木贤治郎在会上讲话。他们指出：在莫斯科发生的血腥镇压事件，是世界上一小撮反动势力害怕中国人民正在胜利开展的无产阶级文化大革命、害怕当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想而采取的一次疯狂进攻，一次新的反扑。他们警告苏修法西斯暴徒：从历史舞台被抛下去的必然是你们。
    他们说，反帝反修斗争是日中两国人民的共同任务。我们确信，只有活学活用毛主席著作，才能取得反帝反修斗争的胜利，日本革命人民将更加努力学习毛主席思想，高举日本人民反帝反修斗争的旗帜。
    在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一也出席集会，并讲了话。他说，中国留学生反修斗争的胜利给了日本人民极大的鼓舞，日中两国人民将更加团结在一起，进行反帝反修的斗争。他还热情地高呼：“中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    中国留学生鲁克全应邀在集会上讲话。她向日本朋友强烈控诉了苏修的法西斯暴行，并介绍了他们胜利斗争的情况。当她讲到他们无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想，下定决心，不怕断头流血，坚定地为保卫伟大的毛泽东思想而战斗的时候，日本朋友报以热烈的掌声。
    集会结束时，全场起立高呼口号，并用中国话高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
