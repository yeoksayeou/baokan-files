At the Shenyang Airport, a member of a Chinese crew, after finishing his meal, personally took his bowl and chopsticks to the kitchen. A Brazilian passenger, upon seeing this, also took his bowl and chopsticks to the kitchen after finishing his meal. The Chinese comrade went up to him and said it was not necessary for him to do so. The Brazilian passenger replied confidently: "Chairman Mao has called for learning from Comrade Lei Feng, and I also want to respond to Chairman Mao's call and learn from Comrade Lei Feng!"

    我也要向雷锋同志学习
    在沈阳机场，一个中国机组的同志吃完饭后，自己把碗筷送到厨房。一位巴西客人看到后，吃完饭也自己送碗筷。中国同志上去劝他不必送，他理直气壮地说：“毛主席号召向雷锋同志学习，我也要响应毛主席的号召，向雷锋同志学习！”
