After the publication of the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," the red rebels of the Sanqiaoshu Vehicle Depot immediately sprang into action, launching a power seizure struggle.

A small clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party at the depot, in order to resist the power seizure by the red rebels, secretly handed over the power to the core members of the reactionary organization. The red rebels promptly saw through the enemy's trick, smashed the shield of the capitalism-roaders, and declared that all power in the depot belonged to the red rebels!

This victory made the red rebels and revolutionary workers in the entire depot even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. However, those hiding in the dark corners were filled with hatred. They shouted, "We must seize the power back from the rebels!" At the same time, they secretly prepared to sabotage the railway traffic.

On the morning of January 17, they struck at the critical point—the boiler room. They incited some people in the depot to fill the boiler with water beyond the specified level, allowing water to flow into the train's air supply pipes. Their intentions were extremely malicious, as the water in the pipes would freeze, causing the air supply pipes to burst and blocking trains from traveling to various parts of the country.

The heating room had stopped supplying air for over an hour, and all the trains stopped in the depot were under the attack of the bitter cold wind. The temperature inside the carriages had dropped from the normal 18 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees. Red rebel warrior Gao Yulin discovered that the air supply pipes were soaked with cold water. They immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their power in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must not relax our vigilance." Realizing that this was sabotage by class enemies, Gao Yulin clenched his fists in anger and said, "These bastards are deliberately sabotaging production, trying to undermine our socialist foundation, and disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We red rebels will not let the enemy's plot succeed!" Saying this, he picked up a hammer and, together with a few red rebels, launched a battle to drain the water from the trains. Off-duty heating workers and red rebels Yu Linquan, Yin Jinghe, and others rushed to the boiler room, started the machines, and fired up the boilers. Soon, the huge steam heat flow was once again supplied to the trains.

The danger of the trains freezing was eliminated, and the enemy's plot failed. Train after train, under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, safely and punctually departed from the Sanqiaoshu Vehicle Depot, heading towards all parts of the motherland.

In this sharp power seizure struggle, the class enemies were defeated. Would they accept their defeat? No. "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The capitalism-roaders within the Party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line will never deviate from this logic either.

After the red rebels seized power, a small clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line at the Sanqiaoshu Vehicle Depot, with the support of the most reactionary elements in their tool—the Red Flag Army, threw down their tools and refused to work. They said, "If you seize my power, I will hand over my position. If you don't let me hand over my position, return the power to me!" At the same time, they used various baseless reasons to incite and provoke some workers to stop work and production. Facing the enemy's attack, the red rebels, on one hand, firmly exposed and fought against them; on the other hand, they firmly guarded their production posts, grasped the revolution, promoted production, and thoroughly smashed the enemy's attack. Old worker and red rebel Ren Songcheng saw these people not caring about the interests of the state and was extremely angry. He indignantly said, "If they don't do it, we will! If they don't manage it, we will! We are red rebels, the masters of the state. We must not let the state suffer any loss!" Many red rebels also confidently said, "Even if the Sanqiaoshu Vehicle Depot faces enormous difficulties, we will still be able to complete the production tasks!" Subsequently, they organized their own revolutionary production committee and worked vigorously.

With a shortage of manpower, they broke down the barriers between trades, with inspectors also repairing cars, and repair workers also inspecting cars... They helped each other and fought together; on the other hand, they actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the deceived workers, did political and ideological work, making them realize their mistakes and quickly return to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and return to the production posts.

With insufficient time, they rested less, tapped potential, and concentrated their efforts to launch annihilation battles. In this anti-stop-work struggle, the car repair group with nearly twenty people had only two red rebels guarding the post and actively producing. The foreman of the heating group, red rebel Wang Hongtu, saw that the car repair group had only two people, immediately found Qin Cheng foreman to help, and said to him, "At this critical moment, we must learn from the examples of Old Fool Yu and Zhang Side, truly embodying our red rebels' sense of responsibility to the state and the people. We study Chairman Mao's works, and we must apply them to this critical point!" Foreman Qin immediately found a few red rebels from the heating group to help the car repair group work, together completing that day's production task.

Since January 8, the red rebels of the Sanqiaoshu Vehicle Depot, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," braved the current, fought tenaciously in the sharp class struggle, insisted on production, not only repeatedly smashed the enemy's counterattacks but also, in the face of manpower shortages, shouldered the responsibilities of both revolution and production. They not only grasped the revolution but also excellently completed the production tasks, ensuring the smooth passage of every passenger train.

Why could these red rebels ride the waves and advance victoriously in the storms of class struggle and production struggle? In the words of the red rebels themselves, it is because "we have Chairman Mao as our backbone, our spines are stiff; we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, and we can overcome all enemies and difficulties."

Currently, although the enemy's counterattacks at the Sanqiaoshu Vehicle Depot have been suppressed, many deceived workers have recognized their mistakes and returned to the production posts. However, it should also be seen that the class enemies are not willing to retreat from the historical stage. They are still waiting for an opportunity to counterattack the proletarian dictatorship and the red rebels. We red rebels must raise high the banner of revolutionary rebellion, be highly vigilant, be highly alert, and be ready at any time to smash the enemy's new counterattacks.

    敢字当头，挑起革命和生产两副担子
    ——三棵树车辆段红色造反者在夺权斗争中坚持“抓革命，促生产”
    在《告上海全市人民书》发表以后，三棵树车辆段的红色造反者立即行动起来，展开了一场夺权斗争。
    车辆段党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了抵制红色造反者夺权，把大权偷偷摸摸地交给了反动组织的核心分子。红色造反者及时识破了敌人的鬼花招，捣毁了走资本主义道路当权派的护身符，宣布全段一切权力归红色造反者！
    这一胜利，使全段红色造反者和革命工人更加意气风发，斗志昂扬。但是那些躲在阴暗角落里的家伙们却恨之入骨。他们大肆叫嚣：“一定要把权从造反者手中夺回来。”同时暗中准备破坏铁路交通。
    一月十七日上午，他们在要害之地——锅炉房下了毒手。他们唆使车辆段一些人把锅炉的水上得超过了规定水位，让水流入列车的输气管内。他们的用心十分恶毒，因为管内的水结冻了，输气管就会破裂，就会阻塞列车通向全国各地。
    暖房停止供气已经一个多小时了，全段停留的列车都处在凛冽寒风的侵袭中，车厢内的温度已由正常的零上十八度下降到两度。红色造反者战士高雨林发现输气管道浸满凉水，他们立刻想到了毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”意识到这是阶级敌人的破坏，高雨林紧握双拳，愤恨地说：“这是坏蛋故意破坏生产，要挖我们社会主义的墙脚，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，我们红色造反者决不能让敌人的阴谋得逞！”说着，他拿起检点锤，同几个红色造反者一道投入了一场列车排水的激战。休班的暖气工、红色造反者于林泉、尹敬和等立即奔向锅炉房，开动机器，烧起锅炉。顿时，巨大的蒸汽暖流又输送到列车上。
    列车被冻结的危险解除了，阶级敌人的阴谋破产了。一列列红色列车，迎着毛泽东思想的阳光，安全正点地开出了三棵树车辆段，奔向祖国的四面八方。
    在这场尖锐的夺权斗争中，阶级敌人败下阵去，会甘心于自己的失败吗？不会。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，也永远不会违背这个逻辑。
    当红色造反者全面夺权以后，三棵树车辆段的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，在他们的御用工具——红旗军中的极端顽固反动分子的支持下，摔耙子，撂挑子。他们说：“你要夺我的权，我就把职一起交，你们不让我交职，就把权还给我！”与此同时，他们以种种莫须有的理由，煽动、挑唆部分工人停工、停产。面对敌人的进攻，红色造反者们一面坚决揭露，坚决斗争；一面坚守生产岗位，抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎敌人的进攻。老工人、红色造反者任松成看到这些家伙毫不顾国家利益，异常愤怒，他激愤地说：“他们不干我们干，他们不管我们管！我们是红色造反者，是国家的主人，我们决不能让国家受一点损失！”很多红色造反者也充满信心地表示：“就是三棵树车辆段出现天大的困难，我们照样能完成生产任务！”随后，他们组织了自己的革命生产委员会，轰轰烈烈地干了起来。
    人手缺少，他们一方面打破工种界限，检车员也修车，修车钳工也检车……团结互助，协同作战；一方面积极地向受蒙蔽的工人宣传毛泽东思想，做政治思想工作，使他们认识错误，迅速回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面来，回到生产岗位上来。
    时间不够，他们就少休息，挖潜力，集中力量打歼灭战。在这次反停工斗争中，近二十人工作的台车组，只有两个红色造反者坚守岗位，积极生产。给暖组老师傅、红色造反者王宏图看到台车组只有两个人，就马上找来秦成老师傅帮忙，并对他说：“咱在这个节骨眼上，就要学习老愚公、张思德的榜样，真正体现出我们红色造反者对国家、对人民的责任心。我们学习毛主席著作，就要用到这个火口上！”秦师傅立即找来给暖组几个红色造反者帮助台车组工作，共同完成了当天的生产任务。
    一月八日以来，三棵树车辆段的红色造反者，牢记毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”顶着逆流，在尖锐的阶级斗争中，顽强战斗，坚持生产，不仅多次地粉碎了阶级敌人的反扑，而且在人手少的情况下，挑起了革命、生产两副担子，既抓了革命，又出色地完成了生产任务，保证了趟趟旅客列车畅通无阻。
    这些红色造反者，为什么能在阶级斗争和生产斗争的大风大浪中乘风破浪，胜利向前？用红色造反者自己的话说，就是：我们有毛主席做靠山，我们腰杆硬；我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想做指南，能够战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难。
    目前，在三棵树车辆段，阶级敌人的反扑虽然被打下去了，许多受蒙蔽的工人，认识了错误，回到了生产岗位。但是，也应该看到，阶级敌人是不甘心退出历史舞台的，他们还在伺机向无产阶级专政，向红色造反者进行反扑。我们红色造反者，必须高举革命造反大旗，高度警惕，高度戒备，时刻准备粉碎阶级敌人的新反扑。
