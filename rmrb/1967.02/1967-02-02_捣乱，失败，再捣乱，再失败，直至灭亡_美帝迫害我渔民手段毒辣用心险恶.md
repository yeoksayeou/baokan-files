The U.S. empire kidnapped 48 of our fishermen and took them to South Vietnam, subjecting them to brutal persecution and attempting to gather intelligence on our country and incite them to betray their nation. The fishermen, through their tenacious struggle, finally returned to the embrace of their motherland.

	GUANGZHOU, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) — Forty-eight fishermen from Danzhou County, Guangdong Province, who recently returned from South Vietnam, have reported to relevant authorities the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in forcibly abducting and persecuting our fishermen. They have exposed a major political conspiracy jointly plotted by U.S. imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the South Vietnamese puppet regime.

	The 48 fishermen from our country were kidnapped by American bandits while fishing in the public seas of the Beibu Gulf in early December last year. On November 30, 1966, the Red Fish Boat No. 1056 from the Hener Brigade of Baima Well Commune and the Red Fish Boat No. 5 from the Jinxing Brigade of Xinying Commune in Danzhou County, Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, were fishing in the public seas of the Beibu Gulf when they encountered a sudden storm. The two small boats of No. 5 and the No. 1056 were blown southward by the wind. On the evening of December 5, the No. 1056 drifted to the sea off Nha Trang, South Vietnam. As the winds and waves subsided, just as our fishermen were preparing to hoist the sails and return, they were suddenly intercepted by two American military gunboats, which forcibly towed our fishing boats into Nha Trang and detained our 44 fishermen. On December 6 and 7, the two small boats of the No. 5 fishing boat from the Jinxing Brigade of Xinying Commune were also seized by the U.S. Navy stationed in Da Nang. The four fishermen on board were detained by the U.S. warship for more than ten days and were sent to the fake police station in Nha Trang on December 19, where they were imprisoned with the fishermen from the Hener Brigade. They were subjected to various forms of persecution. Due to the brave and tenacious struggle of our fishermen against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and after multiple negotiations by the Red Cross Society of China, the U.S. authorities were finally forced to send them all back on January 9.

	During the more than one month that our fishermen were illegally detained, U.S. imperialism colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's spies and the South Vietnamese reactionaries to subject them to brutal persecution. When the fishermen were first imprisoned in two prisons in Nha Trang, they were made to sleep on the floor, and they were not even allowed to go out to relieve themselves. The fishermen had to clean up the excrement in the prison cells themselves, but the enemy would not allow it, making the prison cells reek of foul odors. When they were detained in the fake police station's prison, more than 40 people were crammed into a cell measuring only 12 square meters, with no room to sit. The fake police station in Nha Trang gave them only a small bowl of rice per meal, and sometimes only one meal per day. After they were transferred to the U.S. Navy command in Nha Trang, the American invaders initially refused to give them food, claiming that the fishermen had no money to pay for it. The U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek's spies, in order to further persecute them, injected poison into all the fishermen. During the injection, blood flowed freely; after the injection, they immediately developed fevers and chills, and the next day they became swollen, with each person experiencing chills for three or four days.

	U.S. imperialism, the Taiwan bandits, and the South Vietnamese puppet regime colluded with each other, using various threats and inducements to repeatedly interrogate our fishermen, gathering military, political, and economic intelligence, and attempting to incite our fishermen to betray their country and join the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spy organizations. On the second day of their imprisonment, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spies began interrogating them one by one. Those participating in the interrogation included American military officers and South Vietnamese fake soldiers, as well as the former fake county magistrate of Danzhou, Wang Huan, who had fled to South Vietnam after the liberation of our country and whose hands were stained with the blood of the people. After the interrogation, they were forced to fill out forms, sign their names, and press their fingerprints. During the interrogation, the participating American military officers repeatedly mentioned the spy activities of U.S. aircraft frequently invading our airspace for reconnaissance flights and repeatedly asked whether U.S. warships could enter and exit various ports along the coast of Hainan Island, fully exposing the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism to invade our country.

	Under the orders of their American masters, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits sent a large number of henchmen to carry out subversive activities against our fishermen. To achieve this despicable plot, the bandits specially sent a so-called "secretary" from Taiwan to Nha Trang and a so-called "special envoy" from Saigon to Nha Trang. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits rounded up more than ten demons and monsters who had fled from Danzhou to South Vietnam before liberation, as well as landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and traitors who had killed our cadres and betrayed the country after liberation, to carry out "psychological warfare" on our fishermen, attempting to incite them to betray their country and flee to Taiwan.

	Relevant authorities in our country pointed out that this incident of U.S. imperialism kidnapping and persecuting our fishermen is a major political conspiracy jointly plotted by U.S. imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the South Vietnamese puppet regime. The so-called "rescue of Chinese fishermen in distress" propagated by U.S. imperialism is a complete lie, aimed at covering up its nefarious activities in kidnapping our fishermen and attempting to offset the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's aircraft and warships frequently invading our airspace and territorial waters, bombing and strafing our fishing boats and fishermen, and evading the just condemnation of world public opinion. This incident once again shows that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the South Vietnamese puppet regime are not willing to accept their failures. We must be a hundred times more vigilant and be prepared at any time to smash all their evil plots.

    美帝迫害我渔民手段毒辣用心险恶
    美帝把我四十八名渔民劫往南越，对他们进行残酷迫害，并妄图刺探我国情报，策动他们叛国投敌。渔民们经过顽强斗争，终于回到祖国怀抱。
    新华社广州一日电　最近从南越回到祖国的广东省儋县四十八名渔民，回国后向有关方面控诉了美帝国主义强行劫持和迫害我国渔民的滔天罪行，揭露了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮和南越傀儡当局共同策划的一个重大政治阴谋。
    我国四十八名渔民是去年十二月初在北部湾的公海上进行生产时被美国强盗劫走的。去年十一月三十日，我广东省海南岛儋县白马井公社禾能大队一○五六号红鱼船和新英公社金星大队五号红鱼船在北部湾公海上捕鱼时，忽然遇上大风，五号船的两只小艇和一○五六号船随风南飘。十二月五日傍晚，一○五六号船飘流到南越芽庄对面的海上，风浪已小，正当我渔民准备扬帆返航时，突然被两艘美军炮艇截住，强行把我渔船拖进芽庄，把我四十四名渔民禁闭起来。十二月六日和七日，我新英公社金星大队五号渔船的两只小艇也被美国驻岘港海军劫持，船上四名渔民被美国军舰扣留十多天，并于十二月十九日把他们送到芽庄伪警察局和我禾能大队渔民关在一起，进行各种迫害。由于我国渔民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了英勇顽强的斗争，并经过我国红十字会的多次交涉，美国当局才被迫于一月九日将他们全部送回。
    在我国渔民被非法劫持的一个多月中，美帝国主义勾结蒋介石特务和南越反动派，对他们进行了残酷的迫害。渔民们先后被关押在芽庄的两个监狱里时，都是睡在地板上，大小便也不准出来。渔民们自己要清理牢房里的大小便，敌人也不准，弄得牢房里臭气熏天。他们被押在伪警察局的监狱里时，四十多人挤在一个十二平方米宽的牢房间里，坐也坐不下。芽庄伪警察局每餐只给他们每人一小碗饭，有时每天只给一餐。他们被押送到美国驻芽庄海军司令部以后，美国侵略者开始时借口渔民们没有饭金，竟然不给他们饭吃。美蒋特务为了进一步迫害他们，还惨无人道地给全体渔民注射毒素。注射时，鲜血直流；注射后，他们身上马上发热发冷，第二天就水肿起来，每个人都发冷三四天以上。
    美帝国主义、台湾蒋匪帮和南越傀儡当局互相勾结，还采取种种威逼利诱的手段，反复对我渔民进行逼供，搜集我军事、政治、经济情报，策动我渔民叛国投敌，胁迫他们参加美蒋特务组织。渔民们被关进监牢的第二天，美蒋特务就对他们逐个进行审讯。参加审讯的有美国军官和南越伪军，还有我国解放初期逃跑到南越的双手沾满人民鲜血的国民党伪儋县县长王焕。审讯后，又强迫渔民们逐个填表、签名、按手印。在审讯过程中，参加审讯的美国军官曾多次提到美国飞机不断侵入我国领空进行侦察飞行的间谍活动，并且一再查问海南岛沿海各港口能否进出美国军舰，充分地暴露了美帝国主义正准备对我国进行侵略的罪恶企图。
    在美国主子的指使下，蒋介石匪帮出动大批爪牙对我渔民进行策反活动。为了实现这一卑鄙阴谋，蒋匪帮特地从台湾派了一个所谓“秘书”到芽庄，还派了一个所谓“特派员”从西贡赶到芽庄。此外，蒋介石匪帮搜罗了一批解放前从儋县逃到南越的牛鬼蛇神，以及解放后杀害我干部叛国投敌的地富反坏分子共十多个家伙，对我渔民进行“心战”，妄图策动他们背叛祖国，逃去台湾。
    我国有关方面强调指出，这次美帝国主义劫持和迫害我国渔民的海盗行为，完全是它勾结蒋介石匪帮和南越傀儡当局共同策划的一个重大政治阴谋。美帝国主义大肆宣扬的所谓“搭救中国遇难渔民”的说法，完全是骗人的鬼话，其目的无非是为了掩盖其劫持我国渔民的不可告人的勾当，妄图抵销美帝国主义飞机和军舰不断侵犯我国领空领海、轰炸扫射我渔船渔民的滔天罪行，逃避世界舆论的正义谴责。这次事件再一次表明，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮和南越傀儡集团决不甘心于他们的失败，我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，随时准备粉碎敌人的一切罪恶阴谋。
