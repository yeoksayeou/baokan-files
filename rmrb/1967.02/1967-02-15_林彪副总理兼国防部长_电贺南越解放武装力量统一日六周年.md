Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao today sent a cable to Nguyen Chi Thanh, Chairman of the Military Commission of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to congratulate the sixth anniversary of the Vietnam South Liberation Armed Forces Day. The full text is as follows:

To Nguyen Chi Thanh, Chairman of the Military Commission of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam:

On the sixth anniversary of the Vietnam South Liberation Armed Forces Day, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend our warmest congratulations to the heroic people and liberation armed forces of South Vietnam who are fighting on the frontline against U.S. imperialism.

Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Vietnam South Liberation Armed Forces have, over the past six years, waged a magnificent and arduous struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism, demonstrating the immense power of people's war. No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists expand their puppet army and recruit other lackeys to serve as cannon fodder, or how they personally intervene and continuously escalate the war, they have all been defeated. The military and civilian population of South Vietnam are growing stronger and stronger, achieving the glorious victory of annihilating 1.05 million enemy troops, liberating four-fifths of the land and one thousand people of South Vietnam, creating a favorable situation of surrounding the cities from the countryside, and firmly grasping the initiative of the war, making the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs fall into a desperate and helpless situation of being passive, beaten, and surrounded by internal and external difficulties. The military and civilian population of South Vietnam who have persisted in a long and heroic struggle are indeed heroic people and a heroic army.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." Now, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam have formed a powerful revolutionary armed force composed of their main forces, local forces, and guerrilla forces, merging into the ocean of people's war, creating a great revolutionary situation. We are fully confident that all the Vietnamese people and their armed forces will overcome all difficulties and finally drive the U.S. imperialists out of their own country completely.

I once again solemnly declare: The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will forever be the strong backing of the fraternal Vietnamese people. We have already made up our minds to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support you in carrying the anti-U.S. and national salvation war through to the end.

We wish the people and liberation armed forces of South Vietnam new and greater victories in their great struggle for national reunification and anti-U.S. and national salvation!

	Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China
	Lin Biao

	February 14, 1967, Beijing

    林彪副总理兼国防部长
    电贺南越解放武装力量统一日六周年
    我们完全相信：全体越南人民及其武装力量，必将战胜一切困难，最后把美帝国主义从自己的国土上完全赶出去
    再次郑重重申：中国人民和解放军永远是兄弟越南人民的坚强后盾，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底
    新华社十四日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪今天打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会军事委员会主任陈南忠，祝贺越南南方解放武装力量统一日六周年。全文如下：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会军事委员会陈南忠主任：
    在越南南方解放武装力量统一日六周年的时候，我谨代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向战斗在反对美帝国主义最前线的英雄的越南南方人民和解放武装力量全体战友，致以最热烈的节日祝贺。
    越南南方解放武装力量在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，为了反抗美帝国主义的侵略，六年来，进行了气壮山河、艰苦卓绝的战斗，表现了人民战争的无比威力。不管美帝国主义怎样拚命扩大伪军和网罗其它仆从为它提供炮灰，也不管它亲自出马和不断进行战争升级，都统统被打得落花流水。越南南方军民，越战越强，取得了歼灭敌人一百零五万、解放越南南方五分之四的土地和一千万人民的辉煌胜利，形成了农村包围城市的大好局面，并且紧紧地掌握着战争的主动权，使美帝国主义及其走狗陷于被动挨打、走投无路、内外交困的狼狈境地。坚持长期英勇斗争的越南南方军民，不愧为英雄的人民、英雄的军队。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”现在，越南南方军民由自己的主力部队、地方部队和游击队组成为强大的人民革命武装力量，汇合为人民战争的海洋，打出了大好的革命形势。我们完全相信，全体越南人民及其武装力量，必将战胜一切困难，最后把美帝国主义从自己的国土上完全赶出去。
    我再一次郑重重申：中国人民和中国人民解放军，永远是兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾，我们早已下定决心，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持你们把抗美救国的战争进行到底。
    祝越南南方人民和解放武装力量在争取祖国统一的伟大抗美救国斗争中取得新的更伟大的胜利！
                        中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长
                                          林　彪
                                一九六七年二月十四日　于北京
