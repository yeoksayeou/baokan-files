On February 3, an unprecedented act of barbarism in diplomatic history occurred in Moscow. Under the premeditated planning and direction of the Soviet revisionist leadership, over a hundred thugs infiltrated our embassy, destroyed the news display window, and brutally beat our acting charge d'affaires and diplomatic personnel. This is another frenzied provocation by the Soviet revisionists against the Chinese people following the "January 25" Red Square anti-China bloodshed.

Our embassy in the Soviet Union is sacred and inviolable. Our diplomatic personnel represent the dignity of our new China under the dictatorship of the proletariat and are not to be insulted. Yet, the Soviet revisionist leadership dispatched thugs to wield axes, forcibly loot, and assault within the embassy premises. The safety of our embassy personnel in the Soviet Union has lost even the most basic guarantee. Such a serious situation is absolutely intolerable for any sovereign state. This situation indicates that the Soviet revisionist authorities can no longer guarantee the legitimate activities and necessary safety of a foreign representative office. Do you still have the capability to maintain normal diplomatic relations with other countries? Do you still count as a country?

Treating the diplomatic personnel of a socialist country with such barbaric acts is something only imperialist and fascist countries can do. We recall that in the early days after the October Revolution, in countries under imperialist rule, there were incidents of assaulting and killing Soviet diplomatic personnel. This was the class revenge and deliberate provocation of international imperialism against the newborn Soviet state. In the seventeen years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our overseas missions, except in Indonesia under fascist military rule, have not experienced incidents of our diplomatic personnel being beaten and bloodied. Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership has actually attacked the diplomatic personnel of a socialist country, clearly placing themselves on par with the most barbaric imperialist countries and the most brutal fascist countries.

The shocking anti-China bloodshed incidents that have occurred in Moscow are entirely the result of the Soviet revisionist leadership's meticulous planning and deliberate fabrication. After the Soviet revisionists committed the fascist atrocity of beating our students in Europe on "January 25," the Chinese people, outraged, held protest meetings and demonstrations, which were entirely just and revolutionary actions. To be honest, in the past few days, the Chinese people's response to the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities has been quite restrained. However, you have misjudged the situation, not only refusing to admit your crimes but also escalating the situation with new and more serious bloodshed incidents. Where exactly do you intend to lead the relations between China and the Soviet Union? Now, the Chinese government has issued a statement, lodging the strongest protest and making the most serious demands against the Soviet revisionist authorities. We must warn the Soviet revisionist authorities that you must comply with this; even the slightest deviation will not be tolerated. Otherwise, you will bear all the serious consequences that follow.

The news display window of our embassy exhibits photographs of our great leader Chairman Mao, photographs of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and some related to the "January 25" incident. The photographs merely reflect objective facts. Why are these photographs so frightening to you? Why are you so afraid of the Soviet people seeing these few photographs that you dispatched over a hundred fascist thugs to commit violence? This can only prove that you traitors fear the truth, just as the devil fears sunlight. You are guilty and afraid that the Soviet people will know the truth about the "January 25" bloodshed incident that you deliberately fabricated. Do you think you can cover up old fascist atrocities with new ones? That is impossible.

The Soviet revisionists' frenzied creation of anti-China fascist atrocities precisely reveals their extreme weakness and panic.

For many years, we have engaged in a major debate with modern revisionism, thoroughly exposing the traitorous faces of the Soviet revisionist clique. Your days are getting harder and harder. You can't come up with any decent arguments, so you resort to fascist atrocities, which is just a last-ditch effort. But the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fear neither heaven nor earth. Will you be afraid of a few spies, thugs, and henchmen? Bring out all your tricks! The Chinese people are ready. No matter what anti-China measures you take, there is nothing to be afraid of. The higher you climb on the anti-China ladder of fragmentation and distortion, the harder you will fall. The bigger the anti-China stones you lift, the more you will crush yourselves. All anti-China "heroes" will meet a bad end!

The Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin cannot represent the Soviet people; they are just a handful of traitors. They have long since completely betrayed the great Lenin, completely betrayed the October Revolution, and completely betrayed the Soviet people. Their repeated creation of anti-China atrocities can only further expose their counter-revolutionary nature to the Soviet people. The Soviet people are the great people taught by Lenin and Stalin, with a glorious revolutionary tradition. They will not tolerate the Soviet revisionist clique of scoundrels continuing to run amok on their heads, desecrating the great homeland of the October Revolution, damaging the honor of the great Soviet people, and destroying the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist clique's frenzied anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people actions are only digging their own graves and accelerating their own doom. One day, the Soviet revisionist clique will be overthrown by the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, and the great banner of Leninism will once again fly high over the vast expanse of Soviet land!

Down with modern revisionism!

Long live Leninism!

### 世界外交史上罕见的野蛮暴行

    世界外交史上罕见的野蛮暴行
    二月三日，莫斯科发生了世界外交史上罕见的野蛮暴行。在苏联修正主义领导集团的预先策划和指挥下，一百多名特务暴徒闯入我驻苏使馆，捣毁新闻橱窗，毒打我国临时代办和外交人员。这是苏修继“一·二五”红场反华流血事件之后，向中国人民进行的又一次疯狂挑衅。
    我国驻苏大使馆是神圣不可侵犯的。我国外交人员，代表着我们无产阶级专政的新中国的尊严，是不容侮辱的。可是，苏修领导集团竟派遣特务暴徒，在我使馆范围之内，挥舞斧头，强行抢劫，打人行凶。我国驻苏使馆人员的安全，已经失去了起码的保障。这种严重局面，是任何一个主权国家所绝对不能容忍的。这种情况表明，苏修当局已经不能保障一个外国代表机构的正当的活动和必要的安全。你们这样的国家，还有没有能力同外国保持正常的外交关系？你们这样的国家，还算不算是个国家？
    对待一个社会主义国家的外交人员，采取象你们这样的野蛮暴行，只有帝国主义和法西斯国家才干得出来。我们记得，在十月革命胜利后的初期，在帝国主义统治的国家里，曾经发生过殴打、残杀苏联外交人员的事件。那是国际帝国主义对新生的苏维埃国家的阶级报复和蓄意挑衅。在中华人民共和国成立的十七年里，我国的驻外机构，除了在法西斯军人统治下的印尼之外，也没有发生过我国外交人员遭到毒打的流血事件。现在，苏联修正主义领导集团竟然对一个社会主义国家的外交人员下毒手，这明明是把自己置于最野蛮的帝国主义国家和最残暴的法西斯国家的同等地位。
    莫斯科连续发生的骇人听闻的反华流血事件，完全是苏修领导集团精心策划和蓄意制造的。在苏修干出了“一·二五”殴打我国留欧学生的法西斯暴行之后，我国人民激于义愤，举行抗议集会和游行示威，这完全是正义的革命的行动。老实说，在过去几天里，中国人民对于苏修的法西斯暴行所作出的反应，还是相当克制的。但是，你们却错误地估计了形势，不仅不肯低头认罪，反而变本加厉地制造了新的更为严重的流血事件。你们这样胡作非为，究竟要把中苏两国的关系引向何处？现在，我国政府已经发表声明，对苏修当局提出了最最强烈的抗议和严正的要求。我们要正告苏修当局，你们必须照此办理，差一点儿也不行。否则，你们将要承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
    我国使馆新闻橱窗里展出的，是我们伟大领袖毛主席的照片，是我国无产阶级文化大革命和有关“一·二五”事件的一些照片。照片不过是如实地反映了客观事实。为什么这些照片就把苏修吓坏了呢？为什么苏修这样害怕苏联人民去看这几张照片，竟然出动一百多名法西斯暴徒去行凶呢？这只能证明，你们这一伙叛徒害怕真理，就象魔鬼害怕阳光一样。你们作贼心虚，害怕苏联人民知道你们蓄意制造的“一·二五”流血事件的真相。你们想用新的法西斯暴行来抹掉旧的法西斯暴行的血迹吗？那是办不到的。
    苏修这样疯狂地制造反华的法西斯暴行，恰恰表明了他们的极端虚弱和恐慌。
    多年来，我们对现代修正主义进行了大论战，彻底揭露了苏修集团的叛徒嘴脸，你们的日子越来越不好混了。你们讲不出一点象样的道理，就乞灵于法西斯暴行，这不过是黔驴技穷而已。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民天不怕，地不怕，难道会怕你们几个特务、暴徒、打手吗？你们还有什么本事，就都使出来吧！中国人民是准备好了的。不管你们采取什么反华手段，都没有什么了不起。你们在反华的支离歪斜的梯子上爬得越高，就只能摔得越重。你们搬起来的反华石头越大，就只能把你们自己砸得越惨。一切反华的“好汉”们，决不会有好下场！
    以勃列日涅夫和柯西金为首的苏修领导集团，根本不能代表苏联人民，他们只不过是一小撮叛徒。他们早已彻底背叛了伟大的列宁，彻底背叛了十月革命，彻底背叛了苏联人民。他们一再制造反华暴行，只能在苏联人民面前进一步暴露他们的反革命本质。苏联人民是列宁和斯大林所教导过的、有着光荣革命传统的伟大的人民。他们决不能容忍苏修集团这一伙败类长期骑在他们头上胡作非为，糟蹋伟大的十月革命的故乡，损害伟大的苏联人民的荣誉，破坏中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。苏修集团疯狂地反华、反共、反人民，只不过是自掘坟墓，加速自己的灭亡。总有一天，苏修集团要被苏联革命人民所推翻，在辽阔广大的苏联土地上，伟大的列宁主义的旗帜将重新高高地飘扬！
    打倒现代修正主义！
    列宁主义万岁！
