After the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoted the revolution, and greatly boosted production. They curbed the counter-revolutionary economic wind, repelled the fierce counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and currently, the total industrial output value has increased compared to the same period last year. Many products have exceeded the January production plan, and production has continued to rise since February.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 26th - In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction held high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy in their own hands. They resolutely implemented the policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, curbed the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind, repelled the fierce counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieved double victories in revolution and production.

Currently, Shanghai, the oldest industrial base in our country, has a thriving revolutionary movement and prospering industrial production. Industries such as metallurgy, instruments, textiles, and light industry have all seen an increase in total industrial output value compared to the same period last year. Steel, hand-operated tractors, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paint, paper, typewriters, plastic products, and many other products necessary for national construction and people's livelihood have all exceeded the January production plan. Since February, production has continued to rise steadily.

At the beginning of this year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party and stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line stirred up a counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind, inciting a large number of workers to leave their production posts. In the first week of January, many factories in Shanghai were in a state of paralysis. At this critical moment, the proletarian revolutionary factions rose up one after another, formed a great alliance, and seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, taking control of the Party, government, finance, and cultural affairs. The proletarian revolutionary factions resolutely implemented the policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production" proposed by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They united with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, firmly guarded their production posts, and worked tirelessly to quickly restore and develop production. Many factories made up for the losses caused by the stoppage in the first ten days of January and produced many urgently needed products for the state within the following twenty days. In the first twenty days of February, the production of many industries has been higher each decade.

Looking at the entire industrial production front in Shanghai, whether it is revolution or production, the situation is excellent and getting better and better.

In the struggle to "grasp the revolution, promote production," the fighting spirit of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres is becoming more and more ardent, and their enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. After seizing power, many factories faced various obstacles set up by the conspiracies of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. However, in the face of difficulties, they showed the revolutionary heroism of fearing neither heaven nor earth, neither gods nor ghosts. They immediately took action, united with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and resolutely smashed the enemy's new counterattack.

Before the revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Plastic Factory took power, the production of phenolic resin powder was delayed for four days. After the revolutionary faction took power, a handful of people with ulterior motives in the factory deliberately created many difficulties in production management, attempting to overwhelm and intimidate the newly empowered proletarian revolutionary faction. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers, at a critical moment in the struggle, made a vow at the factory-wide rally to "grasp the revolution, promote production," determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. At the end of January, to rush the completion of the monthly production task, a hundred and eleven workers were needed on a rest day, but more than two hundred people came. The many difficulties created by a handful of people with ulterior motives in the factory were all solved through the joint efforts of the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres throughout the factory. The factory exceeded the production plan for January.

The Shanghai Tractor Factory, which specializes in the production of Type-7 hand-operated tractors, was severely affected by the counter-revolutionary economic wind that swept through the country at the beginning of this year. Some workers who were deceived left their production posts, seriously affecting the production of tractors and causing many tractors to be unable to be assembled in time. The workers of this factory, following the teachings of Chairman Mao: "To develop the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifices, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," started work at seven in the morning and finished at seven in the evening, continuing the battle for more than a week, overcoming the difficulties created by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and completing the January production task of four hundred hand-operated tractors one day ahead of schedule.

The Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction fully realized that Shanghai is one of the main industrial bases in our country, shouldering the glorious task of supporting the socialist revolution and construction throughout the country. Doing a good job in production is a great support for the revolutionary cause of the country and the world. The revolutionary workers in some key factories that provide important raw materials and materials for national agriculture and industry, such as steel and chemical plants, seriously studied and understood the strategic significance of the great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao, and their revolutionary enthusiasm further soared. The revolutionary workers in these factories spared no effort to increase production and achieved remarkable results. Some key factories in the Shanghai fertilizer industry restored production to its highest level by the end of January this year, and the production level in February was higher than in January.

After seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction quickly established revolutionary production organizations from the city to various industries, and even to factories and workshops, initially forming a new production command system, which played an important role in continuously achieving new victories in Shanghai's industrial production. The "Frontline Command for Grasping the Revolution and Promoting Production" born in the great storm of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai resolutely implemented the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp the revolution, promote production," with politics commanding the economy, going to where there are problems to solve them, often participating in the struggle among the masses, and honestly serving as the people's errand boy. The Shanghai "Frontline Command for Grasping the Revolution and Promoting Production" played a great role in counterattacking the fierce counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind launched by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee; in this class struggle, the proletarian revolutionary faction gained an important experience, which is to command production, first grasp the revolution, and firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, they believe that whether it is to grasp the revolution or promote production, it is necessary to resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Otherwise, it would be impossible to command the revolution and production of such a large industrial base. Now this command is responsible for the dispatching tasks of Shanghai's industrial, transportation, and financial and commercial economic departments, setting a good example for establishing a revolutionary production command system. In many factories, revolutionary production committees composed of the proletarian revolutionary faction have been established. This new type of leadership organization represents the broad revolutionary masses' response to Chairman Mao's great call to firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, and it has shown tremendous fighting power as soon as it appeared: many revolutionary workers in some factories said: the revolutionary production committee leads production, neither relying on coercion nor on material incentives, but relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, relying on political and ideological work, and relying on the revolutionization of people's thoughts. We must put revolution in the first place, use revolution to command production, and drive production.

The significant increase in production in many factories in Shanghai indicates: to truly grasp the revolution and promote production, it is necessary to strengthen the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. Many factories' proletarian revolutionary factions united with the broad revolutionary workers, followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The army advances, production grows by an inch, strengthen discipline, and the revolution is invincible," and after seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders, established some necessary temporary systems and regulations, and continuously criticized small-groupism and disorderly, undisciplined behavior. Due to these measures, the revolutionary and new production order in the factory is beginning to be established step by step.

Under the good situation of steadily rising industrial production, many factories' proletarian revolutionary faction workers, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "thrift for revolution," resolutely criticized various wrong thoughts that do not value thrift, and believed that such wrong thoughts are incompatible with the proletarian revolutionary faction. Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and comrades must continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." The Shanghai "Frontline Command for Grasping the Revolution and Promoting Production" followed Chairman Mao's teachings and set a good example in this regard. The command has not had a single building, a single vehicle, only three temporary borrowed offices, and the few desks and chairs in the office are also borrowed. When there are too many people coming to discuss business, the office is crowded, and everyone talks in the hallway, always maintaining a simple and frugal style.

"The Party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao." The proletarian revolutionary faction deeply felt that all victories come from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao, can the proletarian revolutionary faction always stand unshakable. Now, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai are studying the brilliant works "Old Three Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Wrong Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," establishing Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening ideological and organizational construction, continuously strengthening the leftist forces, consolidating the great alliance, resolutely smashing the counter-revolutionary sugar-coated bullets, smashing all counter-revolutionary sabotage plots, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, and ensuring the continuous achievement of double victories in revolution and production.

    革命运动蓬蓬勃勃　工业生产欣欣向荣
    上海无产阶级革命派掌权后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，大促生产，刹住了反革命经济主义的黑风，击退了资产阶级反动路线的猖狂反扑，当前工业总产值比去年同期有所增长，许多产品超额完成一月份计划，二月以来，生产继续上升。
    新华社上海二十六日电　在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，上海无产阶级革命派高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧地掌握在自己手中。他们最坚决地贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，刹住了反革命修正主义的经济主义黑风，击退了资产阶级反动路线的猖狂反扑，夺得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    当前，上海这个我国最老的工业基地，革命运动蓬蓬勃勃，工业生产欣欣向荣。冶金、仪表、纺织、轻工业等许多行业，工业总产值都比去年同期有所增长。钢材、手扶拖拉机、棉纱、棉布、油漆、纸张、打字机、塑料制品等许多国家建设和人民生活必需品，都超额完成了一月份的生产计划。二月以来，生产继续稳步上升。
    今年年初，上海市党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，大刮反革命修正主义的经济主义黑风，煽动大批工人离开生产岗位。一月上旬，上海许多工厂生产陷于瘫痪状态。在这严重的时刻，无产阶级革命派纷纷起来，实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，把党、政、财、文等大权掌握在自己手中。无产阶级革命派最坚决地贯彻我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，他们团结广大革命群众和革命干部，坚守生产岗位，艰苦奋战，使生产迅速恢复并得到了发展。许多工厂，在一月后二十天时间内，不仅补上了上旬停产所造成的损失，还为国家增产了许多急需的产品。二月份的头二十天，不少行业的生产，又一旬高过一旬。
    纵观上海工业生产战线，无论是革命还是生产，形势大好，而且越来越好。
    在“抓革命，促生产”的斗争中，上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众、革命干部，斗志越来越昂扬，干劲空前高涨。许多工厂无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，面临着党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派阴谋设置的种种障碍。但是，他们在困难面前，表现了天不怕、地不怕、神不怕、鬼不怕的革命英雄气概。他们立即行动起来，团结广大革命群众和革命干部，坚决地粉碎了敌人的又一次新反扑。
    上海塑料厂在革命派职工夺权以前，胶木粉的产量脱了四天之多。革命派夺权后，厂内一小撮别有用心的人，又故意在生产管理上制造许多难题，妄图把刚刚掌权的无产阶级革命派难倒、吓倒。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人在斗争的紧要关头，在全厂举行的抓革命，促生产誓师大会上，立下誓言，决心狠抓革命、大促生产，排除万难，去争取胜利。一月底，为了突击完成当月生产任务，有一次休假日需要增加一百一十一个工人，却一下来了二百多人。厂内一小撮别有用心的人制造的那许多难题，经过全厂革命工人和革命干部的共同奋斗，都一个个地解决了。一月份这个厂超额完成了生产计划。
  　专门生产工农七型手扶拖拉机的上海拖拉机厂，在今年年初刮起一股反革命经济主义妖风时，一些受蒙蔽的工人离开了生产岗位，严重地影响了拖拉机的生产，使许多拖拉机不能及时装配成台。这个厂的工人，按照毛主席的教导：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”每天早上七点上班，晚上七点下班，连续一个多星期，坚持战斗，克服了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派制造的困难，提前一天完成了一月份四百台手扶拖拉机的生产任务。
    上海无产阶级革命派充分认识到上海是我国的主要工业基地之一，担负着支援全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光荣任务，搞好生产是对全国和世界革命事业的巨大支持。一些为全国工农业生产提供重要原料、材料的钢铁厂、化工厂的革命工人，认真学习体会毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的战略意义，革命积极性进一步高涨。这些厂的革命工人，千方百计增加生产，取得了显著的成绩。上海化肥行业中有些重点工厂，今年一月底，化肥生产就恢复到过去最高的水平，二月份的生产水平又比一月份提高。
    上海无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权以后，从全市到各行业的许多工厂以至车间，都迅速建立起革命生产组织，初步形成了一个崭新的生产指挥系统，对上海工业生产不断取得新胜利起了重要的作用。在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中诞生的上海市“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部，坚决执行我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，以政治统帅经济，那里有问题，就到那里去解决，经常深入到群众中去参加战斗，老老实实做人民的勤务员。上海市“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部在反击旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掀起的反革命修正主义的经济主义的猖狂进攻中，立下了巨大功勋；在这一场阶级斗争中，无产阶级革命派得到了一个重要经验，就是要指挥生产，首先要抓好革命，要坚持高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。同时，他们认为，无论是抓好革命，还是促好生产，都必须坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。否则，就无法指挥好这样一个大工业基地的革命和生产。现在这个指挥部担负着上海市的工业、交通运输业、财贸等经济部门的调度任务，为建立革命生产指挥系统树立了良好的榜样。在许多工厂里，则建立了由无产阶级革命派组成的革命生产委员会。这种新型领导机构，代表了广大革命群众响应毛主席伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产的战斗意志，它一出现就显示了无比强大的战斗力：不少工厂的革命职工说：革命生产委员会领导生产，一不靠强制，二不靠物质刺激，而是依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想挂帅，靠政治思想工作，靠人的思想革命化。我们就是要把革命放在第一位，用革命统帅生产，带动生产。
    上海许多工厂生产显著上升的情况表明：真正抓好革命，促好生产，必须加强无产阶级的革命纪律性。许多工厂的无产阶级革命派团结广大革命职工，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜”，他们从一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权以后，建立了一些必要的临时制度和规定，不断地批判小团体主义和自由散漫、无组织无纪律的行为。由于采取了这些措施，工厂里的革命的、新的生产秩序正在开始逐步建立。
    在工业生产稳步上升的大好形势下，上海许多工厂的无产阶级革命派工人和革命群众、革命干部，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”指示，坚决批判各种不重视节约的错误思想，认为这种错误思想和无产阶级革命派是格格不入的。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”上海市“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部遵照毛主席的教导，在这方面作出了良好的榜样。指挥部至今没有一幢房子，没有一辆车子，只有三间临时借用的办公室，办公室的几张桌椅还是借来的，来商谈事情的人多了，办公室里挤不下，大家就站在走廊里谈，一直保持艰苦朴素的作风。
    “天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”无产阶级革命派深刻地体会到，一切胜利来源于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。只有更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，无产阶级革命派才能永远立于不败之地。现在，上海的无产阶级革命派和革命群众、革命干部，正在大学“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大立毛泽东思想，加强思想建设和组织建设，不断壮大左派的力量，巩固大联合，坚决粉碎反革命的糖衣炮弹的进攻，粉碎反革命的一切破坏阴谋，巩固无产阶级专政机构，保证不断取得革命生产的双胜利。
