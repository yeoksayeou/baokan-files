A Latin American friend, while visiting the unit where the late hero Cai Yongxiang once served in Hangzhou, met with Cai Yongxiang's younger brother Cai Yongsheng, who had just enlisted. The friend was deeply moved and said, "The Chinese people regard joining the People's Liberation Army as the greatest honor because this army was personally founded by Chairman Mao. It serves the people wholeheartedly, and the army and the common people are one family. The People's Liberation Army belongs to the Chinese people and also to the people of the world."

    中国人民解放军属于世界人民
    一位拉丁美洲朋友在杭州访问蔡永祥烈士生前所在连队时，会见了刚入伍的蔡永祥的二哥蔡永胜后，万分激动地说：“中国人民所以把参加解放军看成是最大的光荣，是因为这个军队是毛主席亲自缔造的，是全心全意为人民服务的，军队和老百姓是一家人。中国人民解放军是中国人民的，也是世界人民的。”
