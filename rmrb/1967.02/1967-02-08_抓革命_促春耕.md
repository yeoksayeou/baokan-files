Shanghai peasants' revolutionary rebel team members raise a key issue in the current rural Cultural Revolution

	Grasp the Revolution, Promote Spring Plowing

	The Wenhui Daily published an editorial stating that class enemies have picked up the "stop production, suppress revolution" trash used by a small handful of people in the city to threaten revolutionary rebels. We must counter this with actual actions to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Currently, the countryside must launch a thunderous political and ideological Great Revolution, but production must not stop.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 7th: Seven peasant revolutionary rebel team members from the Second Production Team of Chengbei Brigade, Chengxi Commune, Jiading County, Shanghai, published an article in the Wenhui Daily today, suggesting that the broad revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in the countryside, while fighting to the end and overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, as well as all the ghosts and monsters, should currently focus on seizing the agricultural season and ensuring production to achieve victory in spring plowing production. The Wenhui Daily also published an editorial titled "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Spring Plowing" when publishing this article.

	The article by Wang Jinying and others states: Our great leader Chairman Mao calls on us to "grasp the revolution, promote production." We peasant rebel team members must shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. In the previous period, the power-holders taking the capitalist road tried to hinder us by not assigning production tasks, but we revolutionary rebels arranged production perfectly. The class enemies want to hinder us in production, so we must fight a brilliant battle in production.

	The year's plan lies in spring. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and inspired by the great situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we peasant revolutionary rebel team members have focused on spring plowing preparation, field management, winter fertilization, and fertilizer accumulation. We are determined to continue our efforts to grasp the revolution and promote production, make detailed plans for fine cultivation, water conservation, and other tasks, and do everything possible to prepare for spring plowing, launch a new production upsurge, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	The Wenhui Daily's editorial states: The suggestion by seven peasant rebel team members from the Second Production Team of Chengbei Brigade, Chengxi Commune, Jiading County, to focus on spring plowing preparation work is very good. This suggestion firmly responds to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution, promote production," raises a key issue in the current rural Cultural Revolution, and should be given full attention.

	With the flourishing of the peasant revolutionary movement, the broad peasant revolutionary rebel team members have launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, the class enemies are not willing to accept their doom. They have picked up the "stop production, suppress revolution" trash used by a small handful of people in the city to threaten the revolutionary rebels. The peasant revolutionary rebel team members who have come out from under heavy pressure will not be fooled. The class enemies want to "stop production, suppress revolution," so we will "grasp the revolution, promote production," meeting them head-on and not giving an inch. If the original power-holders lie down and do nothing, we will kick them aside and take charge ourselves, arranging the revolution and production in an orderly manner.

	Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. If this year's agricultural production is not done well, it will directly affect the national economy and people's livelihood, affect industrial and other construction projects, and affect the completion of the country's construction plan. Currently, the countryside must be in great disorder, and a thunderous Great Revolution must be launched in politics and ideology; but in production, there must be no disorder, and it must not stop.

	The year's plan lies in spring. Agricultural production must not miss the agricultural season, must seize the opportunity, and especially must focus on spring plowing work. If spring plowing is done well, it will lay a solid foundation for the entire year's agricultural production. If spring plowing is neglected, one step relaxed leads to another, and the entire year's agricultural production will be seriously affected. Peasant rebel team members, you must currently firmly guard your posts, grasp the revolution with one hand and production with the other, do a good job in spring plowing preparation, and use actual actions to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

	To grasp spring plowing production, we must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought; rely firmly on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite the middle peasants, and give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. We hope that cadres who have made mistakes or have shortcomings will bravely take up their responsibilities, not leave their production posts, and under the supervision of the revolutionary rebels, grasp production and make amends for their mistakes. Students who are linking up in the countryside must participate in labor and must not interfere with spring plowing production. For those who spread rumors and cause trouble among the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, they must be firmly suppressed.

### 抓革命　促春耕

    上海农民革命造反队员提出当前农村文化大革命中的一个关键问题
    抓革命　促春耕
    《文汇报》发表社论指出，阶级敌人拾起了城市一小撮人用过的“停生产、压革命”的破烂，来威胁革命造反派。我们一定要针尖对麦芒，用实际行动打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。目前，农村必须在政治上、思想上展开轰轰烈烈的大革命，但是在生产上不能停。
    据新华社上海七日电　上海市嘉定县城西公社城北大队第二生产队王金英等七个农民革命造反队员，今天在《文汇报》发表文章，建议农村广大革命造反派和革命群众在斗臭、斗垮农村一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子以及一切牛鬼蛇神的同时，当前要特别抓紧农时季节，抓好生产这一环，夺取春耕生产的胜利。《文汇报》在发表这篇文章时，还发表了题为《抓革命，促春耕》的社论。
    王金英等人的文章说：伟大的领袖毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，我们农民造反队员就要以一副铁肩膀，挑起革命、生产两副重担。前一时期，走资本主义道路的当权派以不布置生产任务来刁难我们，但我们革命造反派将生产安排得头头是道。阶级敌人想在生产上刁难我们，我们就要在生产上打一个漂亮仗。
    一年之计在于春。我们农民革命造反队员们，在毛泽东思想的指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势鼓舞下，狠抓了春耕备耕、田间管理和冬季追肥、积肥工作。我们决心要继续努力抓好革命，促好生产，订好精耕细作、兴修水利等计划，为春耕作好一切准备工作，掀起一个生产新高潮，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    《文汇报》的社论说：嘉定县城西公社城北大队第二生产队七个农民造反队员关于抓紧春耕准备工作的建议非常好。这个建议，坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，提出了当前农村文化大革命中一个关键问题，应该引起充分重视。
    随着革命农民运动的蓬勃兴起，广大农民革命造反队员向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。但是，阶级敌人决不甘心自己的灭亡。他们拾起了城市中一小撮人用过的“停生产、压革命”的破烂，来威胁革命造反派。从重重压力下“杀”出来的农民革命造反队员，是决不会上当的。阶级敌人“停生产、压革命”，我们就来“抓革命，促生产”，针尖对麦芒，丝毫不让步。如果原来的当权派躺下不干，我们就把他一脚踢开，自己当家作主，把革命和生产照样安排得井井有条。
    农业是国民经济的基础。今年的农业生产抓不好，就会直接影响到国计民生，影响到工业和其他各项建设事业，影响整个国家建设计划的完成。目前，农村中必须大乱，必须在政治上、思想上展开轰轰烈烈的大革命；但是，在生产上不能乱，更不能停。
    一年之计在于春。农业生产要不违农时，要抓好茬口，特别要抓好春耕工作。抓好了春耕，就为全年的农业生产打下了坚实的基础。放松了春耕，一步松，步步松，全年的农业生产就会受到严重的影响。农民造反队员们，当前一定要坚守岗位，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，做好春耕的准备工作，用实际行动打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    为了抓好春耕生产，我们应当认真活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑；坚决依靠贫下中农，团结中农，充分发挥广大社员的革命积极性。我们希望犯有错误、缺点的干部，勇敢地负起责任来，不能离开生产岗位，应该在革命造反派的监督下，抓好生产，将功补罪。在农村串连的学生，一定要参加劳动，决不能妨碍春耕生产。对于乱说乱动的地、富、反、坏、右分子，一律坚决镇压。
