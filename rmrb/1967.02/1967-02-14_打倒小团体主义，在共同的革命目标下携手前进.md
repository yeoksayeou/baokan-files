In the great proletarian unity, I revisited Chairman Mao's essay "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," and found it particularly touching. Chairman Mao said, "Those who only pay attention to the interests of their own small group and not to the interests of the whole, who appear to be acting for the group but actually contain narrow individualism, have a very corrosive and centrifugal effect." These words struck my soul.

Recently, I had such thoughts when dealing with the issue of great proletarian revolutionary unity. At that time, I even had some resistance to the idea of unity. This directly contradicted Chairman Mao's teaching that "the urgent task of uniting the masses should be actively carried out."

Out of boundless loyalty and love for the great leader Chairman Mao, we, more than twenty comrades, first formed the "Red Revolutionary Rebel Corps" and launched a resolute struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. Although we suffered various persecutions, many comrades were labeled as "rightists," "extreme rightists," and "counter-revolutionaries," we were not conquered or crushed. Through more than three months of arduous struggle, we achieved one victory after another. The situation improved, our ranks expanded, and our reputation grew. At this time, sectarianism began to grow in my heart: I only saw the role of myself and my small group, and did not see the role of other comrades and other revolutionary organizations; I thought that without our "Red Revolutionary Rebel Corps," nothing could be done. Therefore, when some comrades proposed unity, I had some resistance, thinking that our "Red Revolutionary Rebel Corps" had complete personnel and strong combat effectiveness, while other revolutionary organizations were not very good, and that unity was not as good as going it alone. This was exactly as Chairman Mao criticized: "Everything is only for the Fourth Army, not knowing that arming the local masses is an important task of the Red Army." "Some comrades, confined to the local environment of the Fourth Army, think that there is no other revolutionary force besides this." My thoughts were completely wrong.

Great unity is a requirement of class struggle. If the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat do not unite, they cannot thoroughly defeat the enemy. Last year, for a period of time, our revolutionary rebel forces were small. A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, relying on their power, used the pretext of sending us out on missions to disperse our people one by one. They also sent people to attack us one by one, trying to split and disintegrate us. Why did they dare to do this? It was because our forces were small and in an inferior position. If we revolutionary rebels unite, we will turn the inferior position into a superior one and be able to more effectively strike the enemy.

"Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us a bit wiser, and our work has improved." In January of this year, various revolutionary organizations in our school, through studying Chairman Mao's works, had sufficient discussion and implemented great unity. Our forces became stronger, and our firepower became more powerful. Through joint struggle, we achieved great victories.

The practice of class struggle has educated me: all revolutionary organizations must unite and form a strong fighting collective to concentrate our forces, fiercely strike the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly grasp the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy in our own hands.

    打倒小团体主义，在共同的革命目标下携手前进
    邵永泉
    在无产阶级大联合中，重温毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》一文，感到特别亲切。毛主席说的“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”这几句话触动了我的灵魂。
    前些日子，我在对待无产阶级革命造反派大联合问题上就存在过这种思想，当时对大联合甚至有抵触情绪。这就直接违背了毛主席的“刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行”的教导。
    出于对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚和无限热爱，我们二十几个同志首先成立了“红色革命造反队”，向我校党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开了坚决的斗争。虽然我们遭受到种种迫害，很多同志被打成“右派分子”“极右分子”“反革命”，但是，我们没有被征服、被压垮。通过三个多月的艰苦斗争，我们取得了一个又一个的胜利。形势好转了，队伍扩大了，名声也大了。这时，在我的灵魂深处逐渐滋长了小团体主义：只看到自己和自己所在的小团体的作用，看不到其他同志和其他革命组织的作用；什么事情，什么行动，觉得好象离开了我们“红色革命造反队”就不行。因此，当有的同志提出大联合的建议时，我就有一种抵触情绪，认为我们“红色革命造反队”人马齐全，战斗力强，而别个革命组织都不大行，联合不如单干好。这正如毛主席所批评的那样：“一切只知道为四军打算，不知道武装地方群众是红军的重要任务之一。”“有少数同志囿于四军的局部环境，以为除此就没有别的革命势力了。”我的想法是完全错误的。
    大联合是阶级斗争的需要。无产阶级革命造反派不联合起来，就不能彻底战胜敌人。去年下半年有一段时间，我们革命造反者队伍很小。一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派依仗他们的权势，借派我们外出执行任务为名，把我们的人一个个分散调开。他们还派人用几个人围攻我们一个人，想分化瓦解我们。他们为什么胆敢这样做呢？就是因为我们力量小，处于劣势地位。如果我们革命造反派联合起来了，就会由劣势变成优势，就能更有效地打击敌人。
      “错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”今年一月，我校各革命组织通过学习毛主席著作，进行了充分的酝酿和讨论，实行了大联合。我们的队伍更强大了，火力更猛了。经过共同奋战，取得了很大的胜利。
    阶级斗争的实践，教育了我：一切革命组织只有联合起来，结成一个坚强的战斗集体，才能集中力量，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，才能把无产阶级专政的命运、无产阶级文化大革命的命运、社会主义经济的命运紧紧掌握在自己手里。
