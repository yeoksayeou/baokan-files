Exciting news has come from the front line of coastal defense in Fujian.

The genuine proletarian revolutionary forces of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, engaged in fierce struggle, and smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have bravely defended the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We warmly congratulate the brilliant victory of the proletarian revolutionary forces in Fujian!

At a critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary forces are implementing great unity and carrying out the struggle for power seizure, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee have colluded with the ghosts and snakes in society, stirring up a counterrevolutionary wind, launching a new counterattack against the proletarian headquarters, against the People's Liberation Army Fuzhou Three Services that resolutely support the revolutionary leftists, against the revolutionary masses of the old revolutionary base areas, against the genuine proletarian revolutionary forces, and against the leading cadres who adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The characteristic of this counterattack is: vehemently opposing the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" for power seizure. They spread rumors and slander, create chaos, and attempt to rescue their doomed fate.

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The class enemy's vehement opposition to the "three-in-one combination" precisely shows that they are most afraid of the "three-in-one combination," precisely shows that the "three-in-one combination" is very good and has great power! It precisely shows that we should steadfastly implement the policy of the "three-in-one combination"!

It is worth noting that some people, due to the influence of anarchist thoughts in their minds, do not put the "public" first but the "private" first; they do not raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought but are keen on small-groupism; they are not modest and prudent, advancing in victory, but are intoxicated by past achievements, arrogant and self-satisfied; they do not distinguish right from wrong, wanting to generally overthrow all authorities, exclude all leading cadres, and oppose all dictatorship. As a result, they have fallen into the trap of the enemies of the proletariat, following the enemies of the proletariat to oppose the "three-in-one combination," becoming a stumbling block in the struggle for power seizure by the proletarian revolutionary forces. If these people do not immediately correct their mistakes, they may turn from non-antagonistic contradictions into antagonistic contradictions, which is very dangerous. The genuine proletarian revolutionary forces in all parts of the country should learn from the struggle in Fujian, more firmly defend and implement the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" for power seizure, which shines with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Fuzhou Three Services have, in the complicated class struggle, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, maintained a clear mind, and firmly supported the revolutionary leftists. Together with the broad proletarian revolutionary forces, they have resolutely defeated the frenzied counterattack of the enemies of the proletariat, educated and won over the deceived masses, and strengthened military-civilian unity. This once again demonstrated the great power of the defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and powerfully proved that the People's Liberation Army is a strong pillar of the "three-in-one combination."

We warn those few people with ulterior motives: you are pointing your arrows at the genuine proletarian revolutionary forces, at the revolutionary leading cadres, at the great People's Liberation Army of China that supports the genuine revolutionary leftists, you will have no good end!

The new frenzied counterattack by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party shows that their days of doom are even closer. The proletarian revolutionary forces in all parts of the country, let us resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's correct policy of the "three-in-one combination," strive for new great victories in the struggle for power seizure by the proletarian revolutionary forces!

    坚决捍卫“三结合”的正确方针
    海防前线福建，传来了令人振奋的好消息。
    福建省、福州市真正的无产阶级革命力量，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，经过尖锐激烈的搏斗，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，英勇地捍卫了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了新贡献。
    我们热烈欢呼福建无产阶级革命派这一辉煌的胜利！
    在无产阶级革命派实行大联合，开展夺权斗争的关键时刻，福建省委和福州市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们和社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，刮起反革命妖风，向无产阶级司令部，向坚决支持革命左派的人民解放军福州三军部队，向革命老根据地的革命群众，向真正的无产阶级革命派和坚持毛主席的革命路线的领导干部，发动了新的反扑。
    这个反扑的特点是：拚命反对“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针。他们造谣诬蔑，制造混乱，妄图挽救自己灭亡的命运。
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”阶级敌人拚命反对“三结合”，这正说明他们最害怕“三结合”，正说明“三结合”好得很，威力大得很！正说明我们应当坚定不移地执行“三结合”的方针！
    值得指出的是，有些人由于头脑里无政府主义思想作怪，他们不是“公”字当头，而是“私”字当头；他们不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，而是热中于小团体主义；他们不是谦虚谨慎，乘胜前进，而是被过去的成绩冲昏头脑，骄傲自满；他们不分青红皂白，想笼统地打倒一切权威，排斥一切领导干部，反对一切专政。其结果，正中了无产阶级的敌人的奸计，跟着无产阶级的敌人反对“三结合”，成了无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的绊脚石。这些人如果不立即改正错误，那就可能从非对抗性矛盾转化为对抗性矛盾，这是很危险的。全国各地真正的无产阶级革命派，都要从福建的斗争中吸取经验教训，更加坚定地捍卫和执行闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针！
    人民解放军福州三军部队广大指战员，在错综复杂的阶级大搏斗中，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行毛主席的英明指示，保持了清醒的头脑，坚定地支持了革命左派。他们和广大无产阶级革命派一起，坚决打垮了无产阶级的敌人的疯狂反扑，教育和争取了受蒙骗的群众，加强了军民团结。这再一次显示了无产阶级文化大革命英勇保卫者的巨大威力，有力地证明了人民解放军是“三结合”的强大支柱。
    我们正告那一小撮别有用心的人，你们把矛头指向真正的无产阶级革命派，指向革命的领导干部，指向支持真正革命左派的伟大的中国人民解放军，你们是绝没有好下场的！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派新的疯狂反扑，表明他们灭亡的日子已经更加临近了。全国各地的无产阶级革命派，让我们坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的“三结合”的正确方针，争取无产阶级革命派联合夺权斗争的新的伟大胜利！
