	An endless number of new things have shocked the world. An endless number of victory reports have inspired the revolutionary people of various countries. Many revolutionaries have excitedly said, "The Chinese revolutionary masses are constantly 'creating miracles for humanity.' In 1966, they 'devoted all their hearts to the Chinese Revolution.'"

	The thunderous roar opens a new era. Since the beginning of this year, a great revolution, hailed by the world's revolutionary people as "opening a new era of international proletarian dictatorship," and an unprecedented, magnificent revolutionary mass movement, have once again flourished more vigorously across the country. This is: under the resolute support of Chairman Mao, the great "January Revolution" with Shanghai as the starting point has sounded the charge. This is: the proletarian revolutionary factions that emerged from the Cultural Revolution have united under the great call of Chairman Mao for "the great alliance of the people." They have united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is: the Chinese proletarian revolutionary factions have launched a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

	The revolutionary people of the whole world are all cheering and applauding for this "spectacular and decisive battle" in China. Revolutionary people from many countries have held meetings, made speeches, written articles and letters, expressing their most enthusiastic and resolute support and high praise for this revolutionary action by the Chinese proletarian revolutionary factions. A literary worker from Burma wrote in an article full of revolutionary passion: "Let us beat the drums and blow the horns to celebrate the revolutionary workers, peasants, and other laboring people of China, who have entered the proletarian cultural revolution with an irresistible momentum." The chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), Hill, wrote in an article titled "We Pay Tribute to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, Which Shakes the World," that the "revolutionary masses have done a good job of overthrowing!" The Singapore People's Forum pointed out, "The Chinese people have exposed the anti-socialist faces of those bourgeois representatives, careerists, and conspirators who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, one by one, under the bright sunlight, removed their 'official' status, and seized their power. This is a great thing, and all revolutionary people of the world are delighted and inspired by it." The leader of the movement for self-determination and independence of the Canary Islands in Africa issued a statement paying tribute to the revolutionary masses' organizations in Shanghai and other regions of China that have achieved the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The statement said, "The workers of Shanghai have shown to the workers of the world that as long as they grasp the future of proletarian dictatorship and the task of defending the revolution and the national economy in their own hands, they will advance resolutely on the socialist road." Japanese friends pointed out that the struggle of the Chinese revolutionary masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road from the bottom up embodies Chairman Mao's famous thesis: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." Some revolutionaries also pointed out that this struggle for seizure of power by hundreds of millions of revolutionary armies has greatly enriched and developed the principles of the Paris Commune and the experience of the October Revolution. It is a great innovation by Chairman Mao in the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, a great achievement in the international communist movement, and a great event related to the future of the world and the destiny of humanity.

    无产阶级革命派联合展开夺权斗争  开创了国际无产阶级专政的新纪元
    数不尽的新鲜事物震撼了全世界。数不尽的胜利消息鼓舞了各国革命人民。许多革命者激动地说，中国革命群众在不断“创造人类奇迹”。在一九六六年，他们“整个的心都被中国大革命吸引了”。
    千钧霹雳开新宇。今年以来，一场被世界革命人民誉为“开创国际无产阶级专政新纪元”的大革命，一个空前波澜壮阔的革命群众运动，又在大江南北、长城内外更加蓬蓬勃勃地展开了。这就是：在毛主席的坚决支持下，以上海为开端的伟大的
  “一月革命”的进军号吹响了。这就是：在文化大革命中杀出来的无产阶级革命派，在毛主席的“民众的大联合”的伟大号召下联合起来了，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下联合起来了。这就是：中国无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了夺权斗争。
    全世界革命人民无不为中国这场“蔚为奇观的决定性战斗”鼓掌欢呼。许多国家革命人民纷纷举行集会，发表谈话，写文章和写信，表示最热烈最坚决地支持和高度赞扬中国无产阶级革命派的这一革命行动。缅甸一位文艺工作者在一篇充满革命激情的文章中说：“让我们敲锣打鼓，吹响号角来欢庆中国的革命工人、农民和其他劳动人民，以排山倒海之势胜利地投入无产阶级文化大革命。”澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔在题为《我们向震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命致敬》的文章中说，中国“革命群众这个反造得好！”新加坡《人民论坛》指出，“中国人民把那些钻进革命队伍里的资产阶级代表人物、野心家和阴谋家一个个揪了出来，使他们的反社会主义面目暴露在光天化日之下，罢了他们的‘官’，夺了他们的权，这是一件大好事，全世界革命人民都为这件事而感到欢欣鼓舞。”非洲加那利群岛争取自决和独立运动领导人发表声明，向实现了无产阶级革命派大联合的上海以及中国其他地区的革命群众组织致敬。声明说，“上海的工人向全世界工人表明，只要他们把无产阶级专政的前途，把保卫革命和国家经济的任务掌握在自己手里，他们就将在社会主义道路上一往直前地迈进。”日本朋友指出，中国革命群众自下而上地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，体现了毛主席这一著名论断：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”有些革命者还指出，这种亿万革命大军的夺权斗争，大大丰富和发展了巴黎公社原则和十月革命的经验，它是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的重大发展，是国际共产主义运动中极其伟大的创举，是关系到世界前途和人类命运的大事。
