The commander of the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam emphasized in an interview with a reporter from the *Liberation Army* newspaper this Spring Festival that: "The Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam are ready at any time to overcome all difficulties and make any sacrifice to fight to the final victory. No matter how long we have to fight, no matter what brutal and savage means the American aggressors and their lackeys use, we will resolutely fight and resolutely win. We want to live an independent and free life. We would rather die than be slaves."

He pointed out that on Vietnamese soil, the United States has suffered one defeat after another, and each defeat is more severe than the last. The more it fails, the more it "escalates," and the more it escalates, the more severe its defeats become. Now, American imperialism is more than ever exposed as a paper tiger.

He said, "American imperialism is desperately struggling. It has used all inhuman and savage means against both North and South Vietnam, desperately struggling, but it will inevitably face total collapse."

He said, "The bloodthirsty American aggressors use more brutal and savage means, and shamelessly play the trick of 'peace talks' to cover up their crimes, deceive the American people and world public opinion who strongly condemn them, and shake the will of our people to fight to the end and win."

He pointed out that the Johnson clique is still babbling on about being "ready at any time to seek peace anywhere." However, it has sent over 400,000 U.S. troops to South Vietnam and is still increasing its troops and transporting large quantities of weapons. Is this not evidence that it is not seeking peace but is instead crazily expanding its aggression in South Vietnam? It has escalated the war against North Vietnam, attacking the capital Hanoi and industrial areas like Vinh and Thanh Hoa. Is this not evidence that it is not seeking peace but is instead intensifying its destructive war against North Vietnam? It uses modern warfare tools and the most vicious means to massacre the Vietnamese people. Is this its "goodwill for peace"?

Undoubtedly, the U.S. aggressors have exposed their stubborn and extremely brutal faces of aggression. They have been strongly condemned by the people of the world. Our military and civilians are even more indignant. The American aggressors must pay the blood debt.

This commander said: "All the Liberation Armed Forces, from officers to soldiers, from main forces, local forces to militia and guerrilla units, have one common resolve: to concentrate all our hatred on the gun barrels, to annihilate more American, puppet, and mercenary troops, and to make them pay a hundredfold, a thousandfold for their crimes." He said, "The history of resisting foreign invaders teaches us: to surrender to bandits means to lose everything, to perish. Only by standing tall and daring to fight, daring to win, fearlessly, can we defend our nation's legitimate right to exist. As Chairman Ho taught us: 'Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom.'"

He said, the Johnson clique should not dream of staying in South Vietnam. On the heroic soil of Vietnam, there is only the grave of the invading aggressors, including the American aggressors, and no place for them to stay. With the glorious tradition of unity against foreign invaders, with the iron will of 31 million Vietnamese people from north to south, with the experience of years of struggle against the U.S. aggressors, our military and civilians have enough strength to overthrow the shaky paper tiger—American imperialism.

He finally pointed out that justice and the conditions for victory belong to the Vietnamese people. The more brutal the American aggressors are, the more they deceive, the more they fall into a predicament and suffer heavy defeats. No matter what tricks the aggressors and traitors play, they will be punished and eliminated.

    南越解放武装力量司令员重申战斗到底的决心
    只有昂首挺身英勇战斗才能打败美国侵略
    新华社河内十三日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放武装力量司令员今年春节在回答越南南方《解放军报》记者的问题时强调说：“越南南方解放武装力量随时准备克服一切困难，不惜一切牺牲，战斗到最后胜利；不管要战斗多久，不管美国强盗及其走狗玩弄什么凶残和野蛮的手段，我们也要坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利。我们要过独立、自由的生活，我们宁死也不愿当奴隶。”
    他指出，在越南土地上，美国遭到了一个又一个，而且一次比一次惨重的失败；它越失败就越“升级”，越“升级”就遭到更加惨重的失败。现在，美帝国主义比任何时候都更加暴露出它是一个泥足巨人。
    他说，美帝国主义正在疯狂挣扎，它对越南南北两方使用了一切灭绝人性的野蛮手段，进行疯狂的挣扎，但是，它必定逃避不了彻底的崩溃。
    他说：“嗜血成性的美国强盗越采取凶残、野蛮的手段，就越厚颜无耻地玩弄‘和平谈判’的欺骗花招，妄图掩盖它的罪行，欺骗正在强烈谴责它的美国人民和世界舆论，动摇我国人民的决战决胜意志。”
    他指出，约翰逊集团仍然喋喋不休地叫嚷，它“随时准备在任何时候到任何地方去谋求和平”。但是它向越南南方派遣了四十多万美军，并且还在继续增兵和大规模增运武器，这难道是它希望和平，而不是正在疯狂地扩大侵略越南南方的战争吗？它对越南北方进行战争“升级”，袭击首都河内市和越池、太原等工业区，这难道也是它希望和平，而不是加强对越南北方的破坏性战争吗？它用现代化的战争工具和最恶毒的手段大规模地屠杀越南人民，这难道是它的和平“诚意”吗？
    他说，毫无疑义，美国侵略者已经自我暴露了它的顽固和极其凶残的侵略面目。它遭到了世界人民的强烈谴责。我们军民更加义愤填膺，美国强盗必须偿还血债。
    这位司令员说：“全体解放武装力量，从干部到战士，从主力部队、地方部队到民兵游击队，唯一的共同决心就是，把全部仇恨集中到枪口上，消灭更多的美军、伪军和帮凶军，叫它们成百成千倍地偿还血债。”他说：“抵抗外国侵略者的英勇斗争历史教导我们：凡是向强盗低头屈服，就是丧失一切，就是灭亡。只有昂首挺身地站起来，敢于战斗，敢于夺取胜利，毫无畏惧，才能维护自己民族正当的生存权利。正如胡主席教导我们的：‘没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了’。”他说，约翰逊集团不要妄想赖在越南南方。在英雄的越南土地上，只有包括美国侵略者在内的侵略强盗的坟墓，而绝没有它们的容身之地。有着团结抗击外国侵略者的光荣传统，有着从北到南的三千一百万越南人民钢铁般的决心，有着同美国侵略军进行了多年的较量的经验，我们军民拥有足够的力量，把摇摇欲坠的泥足巨人——美帝国主义打倒。
    他最后指出，正义和必胜的条件是属于越南人民的。美国侵略强盗越凶残，越进行欺骗，就越陷于窘境和遭到惨重的失败。不管侵略强盗和卖国贼玩弄什么花招，也必将遭到惩罚和被消灭掉。
