The liberation armed forces of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam bravely fought from February 17 to 19 and thoroughly smashed the "sweep" by two enemy regiments, killing and wounding nearly a thousand enemy troops and completely annihilating or severely decimating five enemy battalions.

The report said that the American aggressors and their lackeys, together with the puppet army's strategic mobile forces, formed two regiments and launched a "sweep" in the western region of Son Tinh District. On February 17, the paratrooper regiment composed of three puppet paratrooper battalions was air-dropped into the western region of Son Tinh District and the northern region of Tra Bong River. To support this paratrooper regiment, the enemy also formed a commando regiment with three puppet battalions, departing from Quang Ngai City and advancing towards the southern bank of Tra Bong River. Additionally, a contingent of American invaders was air-dropped into the left bank area of Phu My County to block the liberation armed forces in this region. However, all these cunning plots of the American aggressors and their lackeys were foiled.

On the morning of February 17, when the puppet 8th Paratrooper Battalion was air-dropped into the Xom Rang area, about 20 kilometers northwest of Quang Ngai City, the liberation armed forces immediately surrounded and launched a fierce attack on them. At this time, the enemy, on the one hand, used aircraft and artillery for cover, and on the other hand, air-dropped the 1st Battalion for reinforcement. But this battalion was also tightly surrounded and continuously attacked by local forces and guerrillas. On the 18th, the enemy air-dropped the 7th Paratrooper Battalion, which was kept in reserve, into this area, attempting to cooperate with these two battalions for a counterattack. However, before they could organize their forces, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on this paratrooper regiment that night.

On the morning of the 19th, the liberation armed forces launched a comprehensive attack on the enemy's base, completely annihilating the 7th Battalion in the areas of Tan Phu and Xom Rang, and inflicting heavy casualties on the 1st and 8th Battalions. The remnants, while fleeing to Quang Ngai City, were further annihilated by the guerrillas.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 25th, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam, in the anti-"sweep" battles in the first half of February, annihilated more than 300 American invaders (including the complete annihilation of an entire company), and shot down three helicopters.

The report said that on the 2nd, several American battalions launched a "sweep" in the small river area of D War Zone in Binh Dinh Province. The liberation armed forces, who were always vigilant, had long laid a trap for these savage invaders. As soon as the American invaders were air-dropped into this area, they were immediately met with a fierce counterattack, and an entire company was completely annihilated in the area of New Liberty Bridge. Subsequently, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce artillery attack on the enemy's forward command post, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties.

    南越广义解放军粉碎“扫荡”歼敌近千
    边和解放武装力量设下天罗地网痛击美空降兵全歼一个连
    据新华社河内二十四日电　据越南南方解放电台广播，越南南方广义省解放武装力量在二月十七日到十九日期间，英勇奋战，彻底粉碎了伪军两个战团的大“扫荡”，打死打伤敌人近千名，全歼和严重杀伤伪军五个营。
    报道说，美国强盗及其走狗纠集伪军的战略机动力量，组成两个战团，向山晶县西部地区发动“扫荡”。二月十七日，由伪军伞兵三个营组成的伞兵战团，被空投到山晶县西部和茶曲江北面地区。为配合这个伞兵战团，敌人又以伪军三个营组成别动战团，从广义市出发，向茶曲江南岸进犯。另外还有一股美国侵略军被空降到平山县左寨地区，以阻拦这个地区的解放武装力量。但是美国强盗及其走狗的所有这些狡猾阴谋都被粉碎了。
    二月十七日早晨，当伪军第八伞兵营在广义市西北约二十公里茶曲江北面的香壤地区空降的时候，解放武装力量立即把他们包围起来，发起猛烈进攻。这时敌人一方面用飞机大炮进行掩护，一方面空投第一营来增援。但这个营也被紧紧地包围住，并且遭到地方部队和游击队的连续打击。十八日，敌人又把作为后备力量的第七伞兵营空投到这个地区，企图配合这两个营举行反攻。但是，它们还来不及组织力量，解放武装力量就在当天晚上向这个伞兵战团发起了猛烈攻击。
    十九日清晨，解放武装力量又向这个战团的驻地发起全面进攻，在新福和香壤两地全歼了第七营，并给第一营和第八营以严重杀伤。残敌在向广义市逃窜途中，又被游击队消灭了一部分。
    据新华社河内二十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方边和省解放武装力量在二月上半月的反“扫荡”战斗中，消灭美国侵略军三百多名（其中包括全歼一个整连），击落直升飞机三架。
    报道说，二日，美国侵略军好几个营向边和省D战区的小河地区发动“扫荡”。时刻保持警惕的解放武装力量，早就为这批野蛮的侵略者布下了天罗地网，美国侵略军刚被空投到这个地区，立即遭到迎头痛击，仅在新利桥地区就被全歼一个连。接着，解放武装力量又猛烈炮击美军前方指挥所，使敌人遭到严重的伤亡。
