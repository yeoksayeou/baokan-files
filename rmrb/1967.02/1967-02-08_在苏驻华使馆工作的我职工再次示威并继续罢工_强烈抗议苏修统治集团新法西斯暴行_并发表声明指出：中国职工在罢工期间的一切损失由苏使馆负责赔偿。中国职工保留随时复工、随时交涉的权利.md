Workers at the Soviet Embassy in China stage another protest and continue their strike, strongly condemning the new fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. They issued a statement pointing out that the Soviet Embassy is responsible for compensating all losses incurred by Chinese workers during the strike. Chinese workers reserve the right to resume work and negotiate at any time.

	New China News Agency, February 7th - The Soviet revisionist ruling clique deliberately created a new anti-China incident on February 3rd, further infuriating all Chinese workers at the Soviet Embassy in China. On February 6th, all Chinese workers once again gathered in front of the Soviet Embassy to march and protest, continuing their strike to strongly condemn the new fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

	On the afternoon of the 6th, Chinese workers, full of fighting spirit, gathered in front of the Soviet Embassy, demanding to meet with Soviet representatives. However, the Soviet side refused to meet them unreasonably and organized about 15 or 16 burly men, one of whom held a stick and another a shovel, blocking the embassy gate and deliberately provoking a confrontation. When Chinese workers tried to enter the embassy, they closed the gate. One of the Soviet burly men even rudely punched Chinese worker Guo Junsheng from inside the iron gate. The Chinese workers were extremely indignant and immediately denounced the violent perpetrator on the spot. They also issued a statement through the loudspeaker to the Soviet Embassy in China. The statement said: "The Soviet revisionist ruling clique deliberately created the February 3rd bloody incident and the assault by Soviet Embassy personnel in China tonight, committing another heinous crime against the Chinese people and revolutionary people of the world. This is an unprecedented fascist atrocity in the history of international relations." The statement solemnly declared that they would continue their strike to strongly and severely condemn the new fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The statement emphasized: "The Soviet Embassy is responsible for compensating all losses incurred by Chinese workers during the strike. Chinese workers reserve the right to resume work and negotiate at any time."

    新华社七日讯　苏联修正主义统治集团二月三日蓄意制造新的反华事件，进一步激起在苏联驻我国大使馆工作的全体中国职工的无比愤怒。二月六日，全体中国职工又到苏联大使馆门前游行示威，继续罢工，强烈抗议苏修统治集团新的法西斯暴行。
    六日下午，中国职工斗志昂扬地来到苏联大使馆门前，要求会见苏方代表，但是苏方无理拒绝会见，并组织了十五、六个大汉，其中一人手持木棍，一人手持铁锹把住使馆大门，并且把门打开有意挑衅。当中国职工要进馆时，他们又把门关上。苏方的一个大汉还蛮横地从使馆的铁栅栏门内伸手打了中国职工郭俊生一拳。中国职工无比愤慨，当场严正地指斥那个打人的暴徒，并且通过广播喇叭对苏联驻我国大使馆发表了一项声明。声明说：“苏联修正主义统治集团蓄意制造二月三日流血事件和今天晚上苏联驻中国大使馆人员对中国职工的行凶行为，是再一次对中国人民和世界革命人民犯下了滔天罪行。这是国际关系史上罕见的法西斯暴行。”声明郑重宣布，他们以继续罢工的行动，最强烈最严重地抗议苏修统治集团的新的法西斯暴行。声明强调指出：“中国职工在罢工期间的一切损失由苏联使馆负责赔偿。中国职工保留随时复工、随时交涉的权利。”
