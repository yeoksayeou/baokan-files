We are filled with excitement and joy as we recommend to everyone a big-character poster by the "Red East" young warriors: "Where is Our Lu Xun Brigade Heading?"

This is a big-character poster brimming with proletarian revolutionary spirit, a fine article that actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle, and it is worth everyone's serious study.

This big-character poster is good precisely because these young pioneers, in the face of continuous victories, not only do not become complacent but also deeply examine the problems within their own ranks and revolutionize themselves.

"Red East" is a combat team directly under the Lu Xun Brigade in the Sports Department, consisting of young athletes around sixteen or seventeen years old. During the days when the bourgeois reactionary line's fog was thick, these young warriors, along with other comrades in the Lu Xun Brigade, followed Chairman Mao's teachings. They were unafraid of the white terror from the power-holders on the capitalist road, unafraid of the attacks and threats from the reactionaries, and dared to risk being labeled as "rightists" or "counter-revolutionaries." They raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified" and rose up in rebellion. Within the Sports Department, the Lu Xun Brigade was the first to open the doors to internal and external connections, the first to sound the call to counterattack the bourgeois reactionary line, and the first to toll the death knell for the handful of power-holders on the capitalist road within the branch committee. They have made great contributions to the cultural revolution in Shanghai's sports sector. Recently, they have also seized the power from the branch committee. Facing these brilliant achievements and rich fruits of victory, these revolutionary young warriors are not satisfied. They timely raised the slogan, "Achievements only indicate the past, everything starts from zero," using Mao Zedong Thought as a microscope to begin a deep examination and criticism of various non-proletarian thoughts within their own ranks, revolutionizing themselves. This is a truly precious spirit of thorough revolution!

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must continually regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." In the cultural revolution, we must revolutionize the handful of power-holders on the capitalist road within the party, seize their power, and fight them down, fight them to the end, and fight them into oblivion; but at the same time, we must also revolutionize the bourgeois thoughts in our own minds. The young warriors of "Red East" have begun to do this, and all our broad masses of revolutionary comrades should do the same. Currently, some comrades still have insufficient understanding of this issue, have little interest in self-revolution, have weak demands, and some even regard themselves as old revolutionaries, believing they are steadfast leftists, unwilling to engage in self-revolution, and unable to tolerate any criticism. This is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and is very dangerous if allowed to continue.

The big-character poster by the "Red East" young warriors is also good because they not only timely examined the problems within their own ranks in the face of victory but also dared to open the "door," making sharp and forthright analyses of the problems, writing them into big-character posters to be displayed for the public, allowing the broad masses to supervise and criticize.

This is also very precious. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must listen to the opinions of non-party people." Having problems and being able to make sharp and deep self-criticisms, and daring to expose them, allowing the broad masses to criticize and supervise, will be very beneficial to the transformation of our subjective world. Only in this way can we continually gain the trust of the masses and forever stand unshakable.

However, some of our comrades still have reservations about this. They fear exposing "family secrets" and fear that opening the door to problems will affect the prestige of the revolutionary faction. This way of thinking is also wrong and shows a lack of trust in the masses. The practice of the "Red East" combat team proves: when they posted big-character posters criticizing their own ranks, not only did they not lose the trust of the masses, but instead, everyone trusted them even more. Many comrades (including those who previously had some reservations about them) sincerely called for learning from the young warriors, and their prestige became even higher.

In summary, we believe that the transformation of the subjective world of the revolutionary ranks, under certain conditions, is of decisive significance. At the same time as the initial victories in the struggle for power by the united front of the proletarian revolutionaries, we must, like the young warriors of "Red East," dare to fiercely attack the "self" in our minds and within our own ranks, bravely revolutionizing ourselves.

Victory will surely belong to the proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    为“东方红”小将的一张大字报叫好
    上海《体育战报》评论员
    我们怀着激动喜悦的心情，向大家推荐“东方红”小将的一张大字报——《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》
    这是一张洋溢着无产阶级革命精神的大字报，是一篇在斗争实践中活学活用毛主席著作的好文章，值得大家认真地学习。
    这张大字报之所以好，就是因为这些年轻的闯将，在节节胜利面前不仅没有自满，而且还能深刻地检查自己队伍里存在的问题，革自己的命。
    “东方红”是运动系鲁迅兵团直属的一个战斗队，都是一些十六、七岁的年青运动员。在过去资产阶级反动路线妖雾弥漫的日子里，这些小将和鲁迅兵团的其他战士一起，听从毛主席的教导，不怕走资本主义道路的当权派的白色恐怖，不怕保皇派的围攻、威胁，冒着被打成“右派”、“反革命”的风险，高举“造反有理”的大旗，奋起造反。在运动系里，鲁迅兵团最早打开了内外串连的大门，最早吹响了向资产阶级反动路线反击的号角，最早敲响了总支内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟，为上海体育界的文化革命建立了功勋。最近，他们又把总支的权夺过来。面对着辉煌的成绩，丰硕的战果，这些革命小将毫不满足，及时地喊出了“成绩只能说明过去，一切从零开始”的口号，用毛泽东思想作显微镜，着手深入地检查批判自己队伍里的各种非无产阶级思想，革自己的命。这是多么可贵的彻底革命精神呵！
    林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”在文化革命中，要革党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的命，夺他们的权，把他们斗倒、斗臭、斗垮；但同时，又要革我们自己头脑里资产阶级思想的命。“东方红”的小将们开始这样做了，我们广大的无产阶级革命派战友都应该这样做。现在，我们还有一些同志对这个问题认识不足，对于自我革命兴趣不大，要求不强，甚至有的人还以老革命自居，自认为是坚定的革命左派，不想作自我革命，也听不得一点批评。这是不符合毛泽东思想的，发展下去是非常危险的。
    “东方红”小将的这张大字报之所以好，还因为他们不仅在胜利的面前及时地检查了自己队伍里的问题，而且还能勇敢地把“门”打开，对问题作尖锐泼辣的分析，写成大字报贴出来，公诸于世，让广大群众来监督、批判。
    这一点也是很可贵的。伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“共产党员必须倾听党外人士的意见”，有了问题能够作尖锐深刻的自我批评，并勇敢地把它亮出来，让广大群众来批判、监督，这对我们无产阶级革命派同志的主观世界改造会有很大的好处。也只有这样，我们才能不断取得群众的信任，永远立于不败之地。
    但是，现在我们有些同志对这一点还抱有顾虑，他们怕“家丑”外扬，怕“开门”把问题摆出来后，会影响革命派的威信。这种想法也是错误的，是不相信群众的表现。“东方红”战斗队的实践证明：当他们贴出批评自己队伍的大字报后，不仅没有失去群众的信任，相反，大家更相信他们了，许多同志（包括过去对他们有些看法的人）都从心底里发出了要很好地向小将们学习的呼声，他们的威信更高了。
    总之，我们认为，革命队伍的主观世界的改造，在一定的条件下，是有决定意义的。在当前无产阶级革命派大联合进行夺权斗争取得初步胜利的同时，我们一定要象“东方红”的小将一样，敢字当头，毫不留情地向自己头脑里和自己队伍里的“私”字猛烈开火，勇敢地革自己的命。
    胜利一定属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派！
