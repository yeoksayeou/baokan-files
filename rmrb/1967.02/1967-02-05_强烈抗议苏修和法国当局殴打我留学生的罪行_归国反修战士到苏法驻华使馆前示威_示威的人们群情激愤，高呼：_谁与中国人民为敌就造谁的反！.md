More than 200 of our country's students who have returned from France, Iraq, and five other countries, gathered this afternoon. They held high portraits of the red sun in our hearts, the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, and copies of the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They carried red flags and banners, and brought protest letters to the Soviet Embassy in China to hold a demonstration and march. They strongly protested the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against them.

The brave anti-revisionist fighters shouted in front of the embassy: "The Chinese people are not to be trifled with!" "The Soviet revisionists will not get away with their anti-China actions!" "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, ten thousand times, ten thousand times!" They read aloud Mao's quotes: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks as if the reactionaries are something in actual fact, they are not. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are powerful." They also wrote large character posters on the ground in front of the Soviet embassy and on the walls surrounding the embassy building: "Down with imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!"

The students' representative read a protest letter through a loudspeaker to the embassy, strongly protesting the atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and exposing the criminal activities of the Soviet Embassy in France colluding with the French authorities to beat and arrest our students. An anti-revisionist fighter who had fought with Soviet military police on Red Square in Moscow angrily said: Our blood will not be shed in vain. The revolutionary people of the world are rising up in a new wave of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. The days of the Soviet revisionists, American imperialists, and French imperialists colluding to oppose China will not last long.

In the afternoon, around four o'clock, the anti-revisionist fighters arrived at the French Embassy in China. They held copies of the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans in Chinese and French at the embassy through a loudspeaker and broadcasted the protest letter. The door of the embassy and the ground in front of it were covered with large character posters. Several students who had studied in France stood on a car, holding blood-stained clothes and handkerchiefs, and denounced the crimes of the French authorities beating our students. At that time, the demonstrators were filled with rage, raising their arms and shouting: "Whoever opposes the Chinese people, we will oppose them!" "Firmly oppose imperialism!" "Firmly oppose revisionism, oppose it to the end!"

    强烈抗议苏修和法国当局殴打我留学生的罪行
    归国反修战士到苏法驻华使馆前示威
    示威的人们群情激愤，高呼：“谁与中国人民为敌就造谁的反！”
    据新华社三日讯  从法国、伊拉克等七个国家光荣归来的我国留学生二百多人，今天下午高举着我们心中最红最红的红太阳、世界革命人民伟大导师毛主席的画像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，举着红旗和标语牌，带着抗议信，到苏修驻华大使馆门前举行示威游行，强烈抗议苏修统治集团对他们进行血腥镇压的法西斯暴行。英勇的反修战士们在大使馆门前不断振臂高呼：“中国人民不是好惹的！”“苏修反华没有好下场！”“打倒勃列日涅夫！”“打倒柯西金！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们一遍一遍地齐声朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”他们还在苏联大使馆门前的地上和使馆建筑物的围墙上，刷了许多大字标语：“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”
    留学生的代表通过扩音器向大使馆宣读了抗议信，强烈抗议苏修统治集团的暴行，揭露了苏联驻法大使馆勾结法国当局殴打和拘捕我留学生的罪恶活动。曾在莫斯科红场和苏修军警搏斗过的反修战士愤怒地说：我们的鲜血决不会白流，世界革命人民正在掀起反帝反修的新浪潮。苏修和美帝国主义、法帝国主义勾结一起反华的日子不会太久了。
    下午四点多钟，反修战士们来到法国驻华大使馆门前，他们手持鲜红的《毛主席语录》，用中国话和法语对着大使馆高呼口号和广播抗议书；大使馆的门上、门口的地上贴了许多大字标语。几位留法学生站在汽车上，拿着血迹斑斑的衣服和手绢，控诉了法国当局殴打我留学生的罪行。当时，示威的人们怒火冲天，一齐举臂高呼：“谁与中国人民为敌就造谁的反！”“大造帝国主义的反！”“大造修正主义的反，一反到底！”
