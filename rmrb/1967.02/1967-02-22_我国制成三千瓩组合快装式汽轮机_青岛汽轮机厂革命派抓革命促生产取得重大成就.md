	China Successfully Produces 3,000 Kilowatt Combination Quick-Installation Steam Turbine

	The revolutionary faction of Qingdao Steam Turbine Factory has achieved brilliant results in seizing the revolution and promoting production. They completed the production of China's first 3,000 kilowatt combination quick-installation steam turbine in just three months.

	In a previous period, a small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line in this factory openly neglected production while secretly causing trouble and sabotage. They maliciously aimed to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The criminal acts of these bad elements aroused the intense anger of the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat. In the process of trial-producing the 3,000 kilowatt combination quick-installation steam turbine, they united revolutionary workers, displayed the great, daring spirit of the proletariat, dared to think and act boldly, and overcame one difficulty after another. Under normal circumstances, at least nine months are needed to trial-produce this type of steam turbine, but they successfully manufactured it in just three short months.

	The entire trial-production process was one in which the revolutionary faction of the proletariat studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary faction workers, together with revolutionary technical personnel and production service personnel, followed the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and took the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their guiding principles. With the unyielding will of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, the scientific attitude of Dr. Bethune seeking perfection, and the high standard of Zhang Zide's complete and thorough service to the people, they displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. They smashed all the old frameworks that had constrained the workers' enthusiasm for production and waged a "people's war" in production. For example, to shorten the installation time for users and facilitate transportation, they conducted a detailed investigation and boldly reduced the design height of the original auxiliary machine from 3.7 meters to 3.41 meters while maintaining the original design power. This way, the product could be transported without disassembling or using special vehicles. Due to the change in design, some original design drawings could no longer be used. The revolutionary fighters of the proletariat broke away from the old method of first modifying the design drawings and then manufacturing according to the drawings. They adopted the method of working with the designers to install and draw the drawings according to the actual object, which greatly accelerated the production progress.

	The successful trial-production of the 3,000 kilowatt combination quick-installation steam turbine once again powerfully proved that only by seizing the revolution can production be promoted, and only by revolutionizing people's thinking can construction be carried out more, faster, better, and more economically.

    我国制成三千瓩组合快装式汽轮机
    青岛汽轮机厂革命派抓革命促生产取得重大成就
    据新华社济南十九日电　青岛汽轮机厂无产阶级革命派抓革命，促生产，取得了光辉成就。他们仅仅用了三个月时间，就制成了我国第一台三千瓩组合快装式汽轮机。
    前一个时期，这个厂的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，明里对生产撒手不管，暗中又捣乱破坏，妄想以此来达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。
    这些坏家伙的犯罪行为，激起了无产阶级革命派战士的无比愤怒。他们在试制三千瓩组合快装式汽轮机的过程中，团结革命职工，发扬了无产阶级大无畏革命精神，敢想敢干，克服了一个又一个的困难。在通常情况下，至少需要九个月才能试制成的这种汽轮机，只在短短三个月中就制造成功了。
    整个试制过程，是无产阶级革命派职工活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑的过程。革命派职工和革命的技术人员、生产服务人员一起，遵照林彪同志的指示，大学“老三篇”，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学。他们以愚公移山的坚定意志，以白求恩精益求精的科学态度，以张思德完全、彻底为人民服务的高标准要求自己，焕发出冲天的革命干劲。他们冲垮了过去束缚工人生产积极性的一切旧框框，在生产上打了一场“人民战争”。例如，他们为了缩短用户的安装时间，并便于运输，经过详细调查，大胆地把原辅机设计高度由三点七米下降为三点四一米，并且保持了原设计功率。这样做，产品在运输中就可以不必拆开装箱或用特种车辆运输。由于改变设计，一些原设计图纸已不能使用。无产阶级革命派战士就打破了过去先改设计图纸、然后照图制作的老办法，采取和设计人员一起，按照实物边安装边测绘图纸的办法，有力地加快了生产进度。
    三千瓩组合快装式汽轮机试制成功的事实，再一次雄辩地证明，只有抓革命才能促生产，只有人的思想革命化，才能又多又快又好又省地搞建设。
