The first month of the year is crucial. The spring equinox has passed, and China's vast countryside is about to enter the busy spring plowing season.

In 1945, Chairman Mao said: "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." Chairman Mao's words have equally important practical significance today.

This year's spring plowing comes at a time of unprecedented high tide in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary movement that touches people's souls and promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must make all our work better. At present, in the countryside, we should channel the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm aroused by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the preparation for spring plowing and production, and transform the great spiritual power of Mao Zedong Thought into tremendous material force.

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The good or bad harvest directly affects the national economy and people's livelihood, and also directly affects China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All revolutionary comrades, revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and middle peasants who are willing to take the socialist road must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." The attitude towards this policy is a dividing line between revolution, non-revolution, and counter-revolution. All revolutionary comrades must be pioneers in seizing the revolution and models in promoting production.

Revolutionary leading cadres at all levels in the countryside must step forward and lead the preparation for spring plowing and production well. Revolutionary cadres should always stand with the revolutionary rebels. They not only should engage in cultural revolution with the revolutionary masses but also should seize the preparation for spring plowing and production with the revolutionary masses. They should demonstrate with practical actions their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line. In this way, they will surely gain the support and endorsement of the revolutionary masses.

Cadres who have made general mistakes should not carry the burden and, even less, should not throw in the towel just because the masses have posted a few big-character posters. If they do so, they will compound their mistakes. These cadres should take an active attitude, go among the masses, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and stand with the revolutionary masses. On the one hand, they should welcome the masses' criticism of themselves; on the other hand, they should actively lead the current preparation for spring plowing and production and make amends for their mistakes. Even cadres who have made serious mistakes should work hard in the preparation for spring plowing and production and redeem themselves. As long as cadres who have made mistakes do so, the revolutionary masses should give them the conditions to work hard. The criticism of cadres who have made mistakes should be conducted in accordance with Chairman Mao's consistent teaching of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient."

A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party (including those who were removed from power during the "Four Cleanups" movement) and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society are stirring up trouble, inciting sectarian strife, launching a counterattack and seeking revenge against the "Four Cleanups," striking at revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, attempting to destroy collective property, and seize power from the revolutionary people. They use various means to sabotage the preparation for spring plowing and production, aiming to destroy China's socialist economy and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary rebels in the countryside must keep their eyes open, see through the enemy's tricks, and give them a powerful counterattack. The ringleaders must be firmly suppressed.

Each commune, production brigade, and production team should establish a leadership team for production. In places where the production leadership team is paralyzed, the revolutionary rebels should display the spirit of being masters of the house, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants who have production experience, organize temporary groups or committees to seize the revolution and promote production, and take responsibility for the leadership of the preparation for spring plowing and production, ensuring the normal progress of agricultural production.

Time and tide wait for no man. Spring plowing and production have strong seasonality. While the cultural revolution in the countryside is vigorously carried out, it is the glorious task of the revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job in the preparation for spring plowing and production this year. Knowledgeable youth who have gone to the mountains and countryside in recent years have made great achievements in combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants and building a new socialist countryside. Now that spring plowing is imminent, the knowledgeable youth who are still lingering in the cities should leave their appeals behind, immediately return to their hometowns, and join the local revolutionary masses to make revolution and actively participate in the preparation for spring plowing and production.

Doing a good job in the preparation for spring plowing and production is also the glorious task of the revolutionary rebels in the financial and commercial departments, industrial and transportation departments, and all departments related to agricultural production. All revolutionary rebels in departments related to agricultural production should make every effort to actively support the preparation for spring plowing and production.

All revolutionary rebels in the countryside, all poor and lower-middle peasants and other laboring peasants, all revolutionary cadres, and all cadres who have made mistakes but are determined to correct them must mobilize urgently and take immediate action, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out the revolution, vigorously promote production, fire the first shot for spring plowing, and strive for double victories in the revolution and production throughout the year!

### 抓革命，促生产，打响春耕第一炮

    抓革命，促生产，打响春耕第一炮
    一年之计在于春。立春已过，我国广大农村即将进入春耕的农忙季节。
    毛主席在一九四五年说：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”毛主席的这段话，在当前同样有着极为重要的现实意义。
    今年的春耕，是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中到来的。无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂、促进人的思想革命化的伟大革命运动。通过无产阶级文化大革命，要使我们的各项工作做得更好。当前，在农村中，应当把无产阶级文化大革命中所激发起来的冲天革命干劲，用到备耕工作和春耕生产中来，把毛泽东思想的伟大的精神力量，转化为巨大的物质力量。
    农业是国民经济的基础。农业收成的好坏，直接影响着国计民生，也直接影响着我国的无产阶级文化大革命运动。一切革命的同志，革命的干部，贫下中农和愿意走社会主义道路的中农，都要坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。对于这个方针采取什么态度，是拥护、还是不拥护、还是反对这个方针，就是革命、不革命和反革命的一个分界线。一切革命的同志，都要做抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。
    农村各级革命的领导干部，都必须挺身而出，领导好备耕工作和春耕生产。革命的领导干部应当和革命造反派永远站在一起。他们不但要和革命群众一起搞文化革命，也要和革命群众一起大抓备耕工作和春耕生产。他们用实际行动表明自己无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。这样，他们一定会得到革命群众的支持和拥护。
    犯有一般错误的干部，不要背包袱，更不能因为群众贴了几张大字报就想撂挑子，躺倒不干。如果那样，就是错上加错。这些干部应该采取积极的态度，到群众中间去，相信群众，依靠群众，和革命群众站在一起。一方面，要欢迎群众对自己的批评；另一方面，又要积极地领导好当前的备耕工作和春耕生产，将功补过。就是犯有严重错误的干部，也应该在备耕工作和春耕生产中，好好工作，将功赎罪。犯有错误的干部，只要这样做，革命群众就应当给以条件让他们好好工作。对于犯错误的干部的批评，要本着毛主席一贯教导我们的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针进行。
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派（包括在“四清”运动中下台的那些走资本主义道路的当权派）和社会上的地富反坏右分子，他们兴风作浪，挑起宗派纠纷，对“四清”进行反攻倒算，打击革命群众和革命干部，企图破坏集体财产，从革命人民手里夺权。他们用种种手段破坏春耕生产的准备工作，妄想达到破坏我国社会主义经济，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。农村无产阶级革命造反派，必须擦亮眼睛，识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，给以有力的反击，对于首恶分子要坚决镇压。
    各公社、各生产大队、生产队，应该健全领导生产的班子。生产领导班子瘫痪的地方，革命造反派应该发扬当家作主的精神，同有生产经验的贫下中农一起，组织起临时的抓革命、促生产的小组或委员会，切实负起备耕和春耕生产的领导工作，保证农业生产的正常进行。
    机不可失，时不再来。春耕生产有强烈的季节性。在农村文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开展起来的时候，搞好今年的备耕和春耕生产，是农村革命造反派和广大贫下中农的光荣任务。上山下乡的知识青年，近几年来，他们中间的大多数人在和贫下中农结合上，在建设社会主义新农村方面，作出很大成绩。现在春耕在即，尚逗留在城市的上山下乡知识青年，应当把自己上访的意见留下来，立即返回本地，和当地革命群众一起闹革命，积极参加备耕和春耕生产工作。
    搞好备耕和春耕生产，也是财贸部门、工业交通部门，以及一切与农业生产有关部门的革命造反派的光荣任务。一切与农业生产有关部门的革命造反派，都要尽最大努力，积极支援备耕和春耕生产。
    农村的一切革命造反派，一切贫下中农和其他劳动农民，一切革命的干部，一切犯有错误但决心改正错误的干部，要紧急动员起来，立即行动起来，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，大搞革命，狠促生产，打响春耕第一炮，夺取全年革命和生产的双胜利！
