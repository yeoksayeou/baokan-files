Refuting the "Overstepping the Tracks" Argument
Soldiers Xú Bùjiāng and Huáng Yuè

Just as the revolutionary rebels across the nation are launching a comprehensive offensive against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the demons and monsters are terrified and shouting loudly, claiming that the actions of the revolutionary rebels are "overstepping the tracks"!

Have we "overstepped the tracks"? Yes, we have. We have "overstepped" the tracks of the capitalist-roaders in power, "overstepped" the tracks of the bourgeois reactionary line. Their "tracks" are the tracks of revisionism, the tracks leading to the restoration of capitalism. If we slide down their "tracks," as Chairman Mao has pointed out, "it won't take much time, a few years or a dozen years at most, a few dozen years at least, to inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." If we slide down these people's "tracks," we will lose everything we have gained, and the country, the party, and the people will perish. These "tracks" must be "overstepped"!

We have our own tracks, which are the tracks of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the tracks of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. These tracks are the only ones we must never "overstep." Because they are the only tracks leading to communism.

Two standpoints, two tracks, two directions. The demons and monsters' so-called "overstepping the tracks" argument is completely from the standpoint of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, serving their counter-revolutionary purposes. They attempt to use the "overstepping the tracks" argument to douse the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but this is a pipe dream! All revolutionary people should resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, united in condemning their "overstepping the tracks" argument, and repel their new counter-attacks. We must resolutely put our thoughts, our actions, our country, and our world all on the tracks of the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    斥“越轨论”
    战士　徐步江　黄岳
    正当全国革命造反派向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派展开全面总攻击的时候，牛鬼蛇神们吓破了胆，大喊大叫，说革命造反派的行动“越轨”了！
    我们“越轨”了没有呢？是“越轨”了。我们“越”的是走资本主义道路当权派的“轨”，“越”的是资产阶级反动路线的
  “轨”。他们的“轨”是修正主义的“轨”，是通往资本主义复辟的“轨”。如果我们顺着他们的“轨”滑下去，正象毛主席指出的，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”顺着这些人的“轨”滑下去，我们就会失去已经取得的一切，就会亡国亡党亡头。这个“轨”一定要“越”！
    我们有自己的轨，那就是伟大的毛泽东思想的轨道，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的轨道。这个轨才是千万不能越的。因为它是我们通向共产主义的唯一轨道。
    两种立场，两条轨道，两个方向。牛鬼蛇神们所谓的“越轨论”，是完全站在一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的立场上，为他们的反革命目的服务的。他们企图用“越轨论”这盆冷水将炽烈燃烧着的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火浇灭，这是白日做梦！一切革命人民都应该坚决地站在革命造反派一边，群言痛斥他们的“越轨论”，打退他们的新反扑。我们要坚决把我们的思想，我们的行动，我们的国家，我们的世界统统纳入伟大的毛泽东思想的轨道！
