A new wave of support for spring plowing is surging in Harbin. Factories responsible for producing and repairing agricultural machinery are racing against time to repair and manufacture spring plowing equipment. Factories' Red Guards have successively dispatched vehicles, flowing in an unending stream to the suburbs to support rural areas. The Red Guards say: The factory's power is now in our hands. We must strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants. We Red Guards not only see our own factory but also see the countryside, the country, and the world. Spring plowing is imminent, and we must complete the task of supporting agriculture as an urgent mission.

Many factories in Harbin that produce and repair agricultural machinery for spring plowing are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." While actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are also actively supporting spring plowing. They have repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on agriculture being the foundation of the national economy and the central documents on supporting agricultural production. Everyone unanimously agrees that supporting agricultural production is the responsibility of the proletarian revolutionary faction to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and is their duty. Many factories treat products supporting agriculture as the most urgent tasks to complete. Some factories originally planned to complete agricultural machinery products in the second and third quarters, but have now moved up to the first quarter. The Harbin Tractor Parts Factory, which supplies tractor parts needed nationwide, produces tractor transmission pulleys, which are urgently needed for spring plowing. The factory's Red Guards first focused on producing this item. On January 14, they seized all power within the factory. Before the seizure of power, the factory's production tasks were not completed, but after the seizure of power, they completed the entire month's production tasks in just over half a month. Now they propose to "do big tasks in a small month" in February, completing in advance and exceeding the quota for various agricultural machinery parts needed for spring plowing to support the countryside.

Transporting urban manure to suburban communes to support agricultural production has become an important task for many factory Red Guards. In the past, suburban production teams would come into the city to transport manure themselves. This year, after the Red Guards seized power, this practice has changed. Many factories have dispatched vehicles to work together with commune members for transportation. Some factories have few trucks and heavy production and transportation tasks, so they use their spare time to transport manure to the countryside. Now, Harbin sends more than 70 manure transport trucks from the city to the countryside every day, continuously heading to the countryside. Drivers participating in transporting manure to the countryside all regard this work as a glorious combat mission, displaying a brave fighting spirit, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat. They endure hardships, bear heavy loads, brave the cold, seize time, take the initiative, and adopt various effective measures to rush the transport of manure. Since last winter, Harbin has transported more than 10,000 tons of manure to the countryside, more than in previous years and faster.

The railway and highway transportation departments have also opened green lights for the external transport of agricultural production materials, prioritizing the transport of materials supporting spring plowing. The Red Guards are determined to transport the materials needed for spring plowing to the countryside before spring plowing begins.

    大抓革命　猛促生产
    争分夺秒　支援春耕
    哈尔滨各工厂红色造反者赶制春耕生产机具并积极运送城肥下乡
    新华社哈尔滨十六日电　一个轰轰烈烈支援春耕生产的新高潮，正在哈尔滨市汹涌澎湃地兴起。担负生产农业机具和农机检修任务的工厂，正在争分夺秒地修理和赶制春耕生产机具。各个工厂的红色造反者先后抽出车辆，川流不息地开往郊区，支援农村运肥。红色造反者们说：工厂大权已经归我们管，我们一定要搞好工农联盟。我们红色造反者不仅要看到本厂，还要看到农村，看到全国、全世界。眼下春耕生产即将来临，我们要把支援农业当作一项紧急任务来完成。
    哈尔滨市许多为春耕生产修造农机具的红色造反者们坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在搞好无产阶级文化大革命的同时，积极投入了支援春耕的活动。他们反复认真地学习了毛主席关于农业是国民经济基础的指示和中央关于支援农业生产的文件，大家一致认为支援农业生产是工人红色造反者巩固工农联盟应尽的责任，是无产阶级革命派的天职。许多工厂都把支援农业的产品当做最急件来完成，有的工厂原来准备在二、三季度完成的农机产品，提前到第一季度来完成。供应全国各地农业机械生产需要的哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂生产的拖拉机传动皮带轮，是春耕生产急需的产品，工厂的红色造反者就先抓紧生产这项产品。他们在一月十四日夺了厂内的一切大权，在夺权前，工厂的生产任务完不成，夺权后仅用半个多月的时间就胜利完成了一月份全月的生产任务。现在他们又提出在二月份要“小月干大月活”，提前超额完成春耕生产需要的各种农机件，支援农村。
    把城市的粪肥送往郊区农村人民公社，支援农业生产，已经成为许多工厂红色造反者一项重要的任务。历年来城市粪肥下乡，都是郊区农村生产队自己出车进城来运，今年，红色造反者夺权以后，改变了这个常规，许多工厂抽出车辆，和公社社员共同运输。有的工厂汽车少，生产运输任务大，工作时间抽不出汽车，就利用业余时间给农村运肥。现在，哈尔滨市每天都有七十多辆运肥车从城里出发，络绎不绝地开往农村。参加给农村运粪的司机们，都把这一工作看作是光荣的战斗任务，发扬勇敢战斗、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，吃大苦，耐大劳，不畏寒冷，抢时间，争主动，采取各种有效措施抢运粪肥。自去冬以来，哈尔滨市运往农村的粪肥，已有一万多吨，比历年都多，运得也快。
    铁路和公路运输部门也为外调农业生产用品开绿灯，优先运输支援春耕的物资。红色造反者们决心要把春耕需用的物资，赶在春耕开始之前运到农村。
