	Albanian Comrades Witness the Fruits of China's Cultural Revolution
	Chinese People Follow Chairman Mao's Instructions to Seize the Revolution and Promote Production

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana - Recently, Muhammad Danya, the deputy editor-in-chief of Albania's "July 10th" magazine, who had visited China, wrote an article in "The Warrior" newspaper, enthusiastically praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The article says that under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised the revolutionary consciousness of the Chinese people to a new level. Armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, they have swept away all the filth of the bourgeoisie and reactionaries.

	The article says that during my visits to various places in China, I personally saw how the Chinese people enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production," achieving brilliant victories in all areas. The article introduces China's great achievements in 1966 and points out that the victories achieved by the Chinese people are the victories of the great thought of Mao Zedong.

	The article also praises the Chinese working class for their efforts to study Chairman Mao's works. The article says that Chinese workers study Chairman Mao's works every day. Through their studies, they have raised their ideological awareness and bravely defended revolutionary principles.

	The article points out that I personally saw how the Chinese working class, revolutionary cadres, youth, and all working people selflessly defended Mao Zedong Thought, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism from the harm of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power. They have resolutely fought against reactionaries and the filth left over from the old society. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people have further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, pushing the entire socialist revolution to a higher stage of development.

    阿尔巴尼亚同志亲眼看到我国文化大革命的成果
    中国人民按照毛主席指示抓革命促生产
    新华社地拉那电　不久前访问过中国的阿尔巴尼亚《七月十日》杂志副总编辑穆罕默德·达纳耶，最近在《战士报》撰文，热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章说，在毛泽东主席亲自领导下进行的无产阶级文化大革命，把中国人民的革命觉悟提高到一个新的阶段，他们以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，横扫资产阶级和反动派的一切污泥浊水。
    文章说，我在中国各地参观访问时，亲眼看到中国人民积极响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，在各方面取得了辉煌的胜利。文章介绍了中国在一九六六年所取得的伟大成就后指出，中国人民所取得的胜利是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    文章还赞扬中国工人阶级努力学习毛主席著作。文章说，中国工人每天都学习毛主席著作，他们通过学习，提高了思想觉悟，勇敢地保卫了革命原则。
    文章指出，我亲眼看到中国工人阶级、革命干部、青年以及所有劳动人民如何忘我地保卫毛泽东思想，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，使之免受一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的危害。他们为反对反动分子和旧社会遗留下来的污秽进行了坚决的斗争。通过无产阶级文化大革命，中国人民进一步巩固了无产阶级专政，把整个社会主义革命推向一个更高的发展阶段。
