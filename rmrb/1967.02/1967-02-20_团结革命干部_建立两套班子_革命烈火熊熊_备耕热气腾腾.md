	Unite Revolutionary Cadres and Establish Two Leadership Teams
	Revolutionary Fires Burn Furiously, Spring Plowing is in Full Swing

	The revolutionary rebels of Yao Wu Brigade are leading the broad masses of revolutionaries to seize the revolution and promote production, creating a thriving scene.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 19th: The revolutionary rebels of Yao Wu Brigade in Hongwu Commune, Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." They have united with revolutionary cadres to establish two leadership teams for revolution and production. They have firmly grasped both revolution and production, making the Cultural Revolution fiery and spring plowing bustling.

	The revolutionary rebels of Yao Wu Brigade have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great directive to "seize the revolution and promote production," as well as the "Sixteen Points" and the draft directive from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the rural proletarian cultural revolution. They have memorized the directives of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and put them into action. In the proletarian cultural revolution, while fighting against the capitalist-roaders within the party, they have established leadership teams for production in the brigade and production teams, consisting of revolutionary rebels, poor and lower-middle peasants with production experience, and revolutionary cadres. This has ensured that the revolutionary fires in the entire brigade burn more fiercely and that production leadership has never been interrupted. The management of over 500 mu of vegetable seedlings in greenhouses is very good, with tomatoes and peppers sprouting early and robustly. The first battle of spring and summer vegetable production has been better than last year! Over 400 mu of summer wheat fields have also been uniformly fertilized, with progress faster and quality better than the same period last year. During the Spring Festival, the members of Jia Zhuang, Gan Chang, and Miao Zhuang production teams, under the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary factions, broke the rules, braved the cold to go out and carry manure, ensuring sufficient base fertilizer for rice fields and vegetable fields.

	The revolutionary rebels of Yao Wu Brigade have always firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. They have decisively fought against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, overthrowing, smashing, and exposing them. They have firmly relied on revolutionary cadres and fought shoulder to shoulder with them. For cadres who have made mistakes, they have adopted the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," urging them to correct their mistakes, work hard, and make amends. In this way, they have struck and isolated a handful of stubborn enemies, united revolutionary cadres, and ensured normal production. Many production team cadres have also put down their mental burdens. Some stand together with the revolutionary rebels to seize the revolution and promote production, while others, under the supervision of the revolutionary rebels, have taken up the production responsibilities.

	In the two leadership teams for revolution and production in Yao Wu Brigade and production teams, the revolutionary rebels of poor and lower-middle peasants have established absolute superiority. They consult with the masses on every matter, promote production democracy, and mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionaries. In the past, the capitalist-roaders in this brigade led production in an autocratic and commanding manner, seriously dampening the masses' production enthusiasm. Now, the revolutionary rebels of poor and lower-middle peasants say that they must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, rely on the masses, and follow the mass line. When formulating short-term plans for production teams, they always conduct collective research through the production leadership teams and then mobilize the masses to discuss, so that everyone is clear, changing the past phenomenon of production team leaders taking everything upon themselves. Before the Spring Festival, 40% of the wheat fields in the entire brigade lacked top dressing. After consulting with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, many poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The capitalist-roaders have been pulled down from their positions by us. We must definitely do a good job in production and cannot be intimidated by difficulties, letting them laugh at us."

	At present, the entire brigade has uniformly applied top dressing to the three wheat crops. Many production teams have applied it twice. Previously, winter fallow fields were only plowed after the Spring Festival, but now they have been plowed twice. Vegetable greenhouse seedling management is also very good, with seedlings sprouting earlier and more robustly than last year. Livestock are well-fed and in good condition, and agricultural tools have begun to be repaired. They are determined to fire the first shot of spring plowing production and are resolved to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    团结革命干部  建立两套班子
    革命烈火熊熊  备耕热气腾腾
    要武大队革命造反派带动广大革命群众抓革命促生产一派兴旺景象
    据新华社南京十九日电　江苏省扬州市红武公社要武大队的革命造反派战士和广大贫下中农，坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，团结革命的干部，建立领导革命和生产的两套班子，紧紧抓住了革命和生产两个环子，把文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈，把备耕生产搞得热气腾腾。
    要武大队的革命造反派，反复学习了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，学习了“十六条”和中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）。他们把毛主席和党中央的指示，牢记在脑子里，落实在行动上。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们在斗争党内走资本主义道路当权派的同时，并在大队、生产队建立了由革命造反派、有生产经验的贫下中农，以及革命干部参加的领导生产的班子，使全大队革命烈火越烧越旺，生产领导始终没有中断。全大队五百多亩菜苗的温房管理工作做得很好，蕃茄、大椒出苗早、出苗足、长得壮，春夏蔬菜生产的第一仗就比去年打得好！夏熟四百多亩麦田也普遍施了一遍肥料，比去年同期进度快，质量好。春节期间，贾庄、敢闯、缪庄等生产队的社员，在无产阶级革命派带动下，打破常规，冒寒上街抬粪拖粪，备足水稻田和菜田的基肥。
    要武大队的革命造反派始终紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，他们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决斗倒斗垮斗臭；对革命的干部坚决依靠，并肩战斗；对犯有错误的干部，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，要他们改正错误，好好工作，将功补过。这样，就打击和孤立了一小撮顽固的敌人，团结了革命的干部，保证了生产正常进行。许多生产队干部也放下了思想包袱，有的和革命造反派站在一起，抓革命，促生产，有的在革命造反派的监督下，挑起了生产担子。
    在要武大队、生产队领导革命、生产的两套班子里，贫下中农革命造反派都树立了绝对优势。他们遇事同群众商量，发扬生产民主，调动广大革命群众的生产积极性。过去，这个大队走资本主义道路的当权派，领导生产独断专行，强迫命令，严重地挫伤了群众的生产积极性。现在，贫下中农革命造反派说，我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，依靠群众，走群众路线。他们在生产队制订小段计划时，都是经过领导生产的班子集体研究，然后发动群众讨论，使大家心中有数，改变了过去生产队长包办代替的现象。春节前，全大队有百分之四十的麦田缺少追肥，经过和广大贫下中农商量，许多贫下中农说：“走资本主义道路的当权派被我们揪下台了，我们一定要把生产搞得更好，决不能被困难吓倒，让他们看笑话。”
    目前，全大队三麦腊肥已普遍追过一遍。不少生产队已追过两遍。以往冬闲田过了春节才耕耖，现在已普遍耕了二遍。蔬菜温房育苗也管理得很好，菜苗比去年出得早，长得壮。耕牛养得膘肥体壮，农具开始动手整修。他们下定决心，打响春耕生产的第一炮，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。
