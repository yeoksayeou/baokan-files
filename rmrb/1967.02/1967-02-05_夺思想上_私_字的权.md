In the tumultuous struggle for power, a few individuals are not seizing power for the Party, for the people, or for Mao Zedong Thought. Instead, they engage in personal glory-seeking, factionalism, cliquism, and separatism. They act arrogantly and are untouchable.

All these issues ultimately stem from the "private" mindset.

Those who only seek to seize power from others but are unwilling and afraid to seize the "private" mindset within their own heads; who only touch the souls of others but are unwilling and afraid to touch their own souls; who only overthrow others but are unwilling and afraid to overthrow themselves—such people cannot carry the revolution to the end. They either cannot seize power or, even if they do, will lose it again.

Comrade Lin Biao said, "Each of us should see ourselves as a force for the revolution and, at the same time, continually see ourselves as the object of the revolution."

All true red rebels will consciously do the following: use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world while consciously transforming their subjective world; seize power from the bourgeoisie in power while consciously seizing the "private" mindset within their own heads. The latter is the key and guarantee for the former.

To ensure that the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is always held high by reliable successors and to ensure that revolutionary power is always in the hands of revolutionary rebels, all red rebels should, during the Cultural Revolution, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," and fiercely combat the "private" mindset within their own heads. They should thoroughly reform their worldview and forge themselves into steadfast red rebels who cannot be destroyed by heavy artillery or defeated by sugar-coated bullets.

Only in this way can Chairman Mao be at ease, the Chinese people be at ease, and the people of the world be at ease.

Red rebels must dare to touch their own souls!

"The 'Private' Mindset Must Go"

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution in which the "public" mindset achieves great victory and the "private" mindset suffers devastating blows.

If it is "private," it must go!

Those who, at the beginning of the movement, attempted to grab a straw, dreaming of capturing a few "rightists" to gain merit, promotions, and party memberships, and who stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line by protecting those above and persecuting the masses, had their sweet dreams shattered by the revolutionary rebels.

Those who, with the mindset of "rebellion is beneficial," engaged in economic opportunism, seized houses and money, abandoned their work posts, and always planned for themselves, have had their false rebel faces exposed by the masses.

Those who, with the aim of seizing power and profit, joined the revolution, used the fruits of the masses' struggle to achieve their unspoken goals.

Those who pursued fame and profit could not withstand the long-term test of class struggle and, at the critical moment of the revolution, fell to the sugar-coated bullets of victory.

The "private" mindset must go. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, anyone who joins the rebellion with private motives will inevitably be kicked out by the broad masses of revolutionary rebels.

    夺思想上“私”字的权
    勇于触及自己的灵魂
    在风起云涌的夺权斗争中，有极少数的人不是为党夺权，为人民夺权，为毛泽东思想夺权，而是搞什么风头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、分散主义。他们盛气凌人，老虎屁股摸不得。
    凡此种种，归根结底就是一个“私”字。
    这种只知向别人夺权，不愿也不敢向自己头脑里的“私”字夺权；只触及别人的灵魂，不愿也不敢触及自己的灵魂；只革别人的命，不愿也不敢革自己命的人，是不能将革命进行到底的。他们不是不能把权夺到手，就是即使夺了权，也会得而复失。
    林彪同志说，我们每一个人，要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。
    一切真正的红色造反者，都会自觉地这样做：用毛泽东思想改造客观世界的同时，自觉地改造自己的主观世界；向资产阶级当权派夺权的同时，自觉地夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。而后者又是前者的关键和保证。
    要使毛泽东思想的大旗，永远扛在坚强可靠的接班人肩上，高高飘扬，永远飘扬；要使革命的大权，永远掌握在革命造反派手中，一切红色造反者，就应当在文化大革命的运动中活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等文，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，彻底改造世界观，将自己锻炼成重炮摧不毁，糖弹打不垮的堂堂红色造反者。
    只有这样，毛主席他老人家才放心，中国人民才放心，世界革命人民才放心。
    红色造反者要勇于触及自己的灵魂！

    “私”字滚蛋
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场“公”字取得伟大胜利的革命，“私”字遭受毁灭性打击的革命。
    是“私”，就得滚开！
    那些在运动初期妄图捞根稻草的人，梦想捉几个“右派”可以取得功绩、升官晋级、入党入团……，他们对上面保呀，保呀，对群众整呀，整呀，顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线。革命造反派奋起造反，打破了他们的黄粱美梦。
    那些抱着“造反有利”思想的人，在“经济主义”黑风之中，抢房要款，擅自离开工作岗位，处处为个人打算，他们假造反的面目已经为群众所识破。
    那些抱着争权夺利投入革命的人，利用群众斗争的战果来达到不可告人的目的。
    那些追求名利的人，经不起长期阶级斗争考验，到了革命的关键时刻就拜倒在胜利的糖衣炮弹面前。
    “私”字一定要滚蛋。在无产阶级文化大革命中，谁要是带着私心杂念来造反，就必定被广大的革命造反派所踢开。
