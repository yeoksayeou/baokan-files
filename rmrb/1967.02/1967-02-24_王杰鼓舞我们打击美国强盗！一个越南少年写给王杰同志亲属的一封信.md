Dear relatives of Wang Jie comrade:

I was deeply moved when I read the article "An Excellent Child of the Chinese People—Wang Jie" in the newspaper. I mourn the loss of my comrade, who sacrificed his life for the people and the country—Wang Jie.

Wang Jie comrade, I want to learn from your example and live like you. Although you have passed away, you will forever live in my heart. Brother! You have taken the path of immortality by leaving us. Brother! Your life was dedicated to the country and the people. You truly deserve to be a soldier of the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Your family must be proud to have a son like you.

Wang Jie comrade has taken the path of immortality. This is true. Wang Jie comrade's relatives, do you know? Wang Jie comrade is visiting my country, Vietnam. He is standing shoulder to shoulder with the anti-aircraft troops on the front lines, striking American aggressor planes. He is standing shoulder to shoulder with the naval troops on the deck of the warships. Do you know? Wang Jie comrade is visiting our schools. I am determined to study hard and work diligently to be a good younger brother to Wang Jie comrade.

When Wang Jie comrade was alive, didn't he want to come to Vietnam to strike the American invaders, liberate the south of our country, and achieve the unification of our country? Now his wish has come true. I, along with millions of Vietnamese people, feel that Wang Jie comrade is with us, inspiring us to fiercely strike back against the American aggressors, liberate the south of our country, and strive for the unification of our country.

I once again thank Wang Jie comrade, who loves our country so much. I am so happy to see that Vietnam and China have such deep friendship.

May the fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China last forever!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Vietnam, Chen Wenji

    王杰鼓舞我们打击美国强盗！
    一个越南少年写给王杰同志亲属的一封信亲爱的王杰哥哥的亲人们：
    我在报纸上看到《中国人民的优秀儿女——王杰》这篇文章时，非常感动。我悼念着我的舍身为同志、为人民、为祖国而英勇牺牲的哥哥——王杰。
    王杰哥哥，我愿意学习您的榜样，象您那样地生活。您虽然已经死去，但在我的心灵里，您还是永远地活着。哥哥！您永别我们，走上了不死的道路。哥哥！您的一生是为祖国、为人民的一生。您真不愧为毛伯伯领导下的中国人民解放军战士。您的亲人为有了象您这样的儿子感到自豪。
    王杰哥哥走上了不死之路。这是千真万确的。王杰哥哥的亲人们，你们知道吗？王杰哥哥正在访问我的祖国越南，他正和空防战士们并肩站在打击美国强盗飞机的空防阵地上，他正和海防战士们并肩站在出海战舰的甲板上。你们知道吗？王杰哥哥正在参观我们的学校。我决心努力学习和好好劳动，做王杰哥哥的好弟弟。
    王杰哥哥活着的时候，不是想来到越南，打击美国佬，解放我们祖国的南方，使我们祖国能够统一吗？现在他这个心愿实现了。我和千千万万的越南人民一样，都觉得王杰哥哥和我们在一起，鼓舞着我们狠狠打击美国强盗，解放我们祖国的南方，争取我们祖国的统一。
    我再次感谢这么热爱我们祖国的王杰哥哥，我多么高兴地看到越中两国有这么深厚的友情。
    祝越中两国人民的战斗友谊万古长青！
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
                              越南　陈文纪
