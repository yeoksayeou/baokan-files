Recently, the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their lackeys have been spreading rumors, absurdly claiming that there has been an "understanding" and "tacit agreement" between China and the U.S. on the Vietnam issue. They fabricate that China has privately "guaranteed" the U.S. that as long as the U.S. adheres to certain principles, China will maintain some limits in its aid to Vietnam's anti-U.S. struggle. This is an absurd rumor. This is another evil plot by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to jointly oppose China.

The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries have the audacity to pin this absurd rumor on the Chinese people, who are holding high the banner of supporting Vietnam's anti-U.S. struggle. This is laughable. To be honest, except for those who have lost their minds, no one would believe this rumor. This once again proves that the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are a bunch of hooligans who live by spreading rumors.

Currently, the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is in a great situation. The people of North and South Vietnam are continuously achieving new victories. The U.S. imperialists are facing numerous difficulties and are at their wits' end. The U.S. and the Soviet Union are intensifying their collusion and close coordination on the Vietnam issue, and are joining forces with some reactionary countries to desperately plot "war for peace" and "bombing for peace" schemes, engaging in despicable activities to "press for peace," "entice for peace," and "persuade for peace" against Vietnam. At this time, they fabricate this new rumor to divert people's attention, muddy the waters, and cover up their own schemes to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Their fabrication of this rumor also has an extremely despicable purpose: to attempt to sabotage the fraternal combat unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. This is simply a pipe dream. The Chinese and Vietnamese peoples are as close as lips and teeth. In the long-term struggle against imperialism, they have forged a blood-like friendship. This combat unity and close friendship have been tested by storms and tempests, and how can absurd rumors shake it?

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are carrying out an unprecedented, magnificent proletarian cultural revolution and have achieved great victories. The revolutionary spirit of rebellion spread by this great revolution has greatly inspired all oppressed nations and peoples in the world. This is a revolution that shakes the world and terrifies the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are both afraid and hateful, so they rack their brains to slander the Chinese people. Their fabrication of the malicious rumor about a "tacit agreement" between China and the U.S. is an attempt to smear the faces of the great 700 million Chinese people. You, a handful of scoundrels of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, your calculations are completely wrong. All your schemes and tricks cannot harm the glorious image of the Chinese people who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Vietnamese people are not to be intimidated or crushed. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh declared in his "Call to Arms": "The U.S. imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to intensify their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. But they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation... Our entire people and army are united, fearing no hardships or sacrifices, and will resolutely fight to the end for complete victory."

The Chinese people's stance of aiding Vietnam and resisting the U.S., supporting the Vietnamese people to the end, is unshakable under any circumstances. Vice Chairman Lin Biao has stated in unequivocal terms the Chinese people's principled stance: "We have made all preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers in fighting the war of resistance against U.S. aggression to the end." Mountains may crumble, and the earth may split, but the Chinese people are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people and fight until the last U.S. aggressor is driven out of Vietnam.

    荒唐透顶的反华谣言
    本报评论员
    最近，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义领导集团和它们的走卒大造谣言，异想天开地说中美之间在越南问题上取得了“谅解”，有什么“默契”。它们胡说什么中国已私下向美帝“保证”，只要美帝遵守某几项原则，中国在援越抗美方面就将保持某种限度。这是荒唐透顶的谣言。这是帝、修、反联合反华的又一新的罪恶勾当。
    帝、修、反居然把它们合伙制造的这种荒唐谣言，加在高举援越抗美旗帜的中国人民头上，岂不令人失笑。说实在的，除了神经失常的人以外，谁也不会相信这种谣言。这再一次证明，帝、修、反是一伙靠造谣过日子的大流氓。
    目前，越南人民的抗美救国斗争是一片大好形势。越南南北方人民不断取得新的胜利。美帝国主义困难重重，走投无路。美苏在越南问题上，正加紧勾结，密切配合，并且联合一些国家的反动派，千方百计地狂热地搞“以战迫和”和“停炸诱和”的阴谋，对越南进行“压和”、“诱和”、“劝和”的卑鄙活动。在这个时候，它们制造这种新谣言，就是为了转移人们的视线，把水搅混，掩盖它们自己扼杀越南人民抗美救国斗争的勾当。
    它们制造这一谣言，还有一个极其卑劣的目的，就是妄图破坏中越人民兄弟般的战斗团结。这简直是白日作梦。中越人民唇齿相依，在反对帝国主义的长期斗争中，结成了血肉般的亲密友谊。这种战斗团结和亲密友谊是经过急风暴雨考验的，哪里是荒唐的谣言所能够动摇得了的！
    中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，正在进行史无前例的、轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，并且取得了伟大的胜利。这场大革命所传播开来的革命造反精神，极大地鼓舞了全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民。这是一场震动全世界，吓坏帝、修、反的大革命。帝、修、反又怕又恨，于是就挖空心思地对中国人民造谣中伤。它们制造中美“默契”的恶毒谣言，就是企图在伟大的七亿中国人民脸上抹黑。帝、修、反一小撮混蛋，你们的算盘完全打错了。你们的这一切阴谋诡计，丝毫也损害不了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民的光辉形象。
    越南人民是吓不倒、压不垮的。正如胡志明主席在《号召书》中所宣告的：美帝国主义“可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心……我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”
    中国人民援越抗美、支持越南人民打到底的立场，在任何情况下，都是坚定不移的。林彪副主席用斩钉截铁的语言表明了中国人民的这一原则立场：“我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。”山可崩，地可裂，中国人民誓同越南人民并肩战斗，直到把美国侵略者一个不剩地赶出越南。
