The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Heilongjiang Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displayed the heroic spirit and scientific fighting spirit of the proletariat, and created many new experiences that truly embody Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle for power. They have made precious contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The basic experiences of the struggle for power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Heilongjiang Province can be summarized in four points:

First, the revolutionary rebels, based on the specific situation of the struggle in their locality, clearly embodied the Party's policies and principles, united with the main responsible comrades in the Provincial Party Committee who implemented Chairman Mao's correct line, and with the main responsible comrades in the People's Liberation Army, forming a tripartite alliance to seize power.

Second, before seizing the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, they first seized the revolutionary organs of the proletariat—the newspapers, radio stations, and public security bureaus—and put them in the hands of the leftists. This prepared public opinion for the final seizure of the reactionary stronghold (the Provincial Party Committee, which was occupied by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party) and decisively suppressed counter-revolutionary activities, ensuring the smooth progress of the struggle for power.

Third, they firmly relied on the leftist forces within the units from which power was to be seized, united with the middle forces, and resolutely struck at the most stubborn reactionary forces to seize and consolidate power.

Fourth, the fundamental experience of the struggle for power is that Mao Zedong Thought armed the leftist forces. The leftist forces used Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and correct various non-proletarian ideas, thus successfully guiding the struggle for power.

These experiences are relatively comprehensive and successful and are worth learning from by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in other places. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in other places should, in combination with their local specific conditions, creatively apply these experiences.

The representatives of the genuine revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary leading cadres in the Party and government organs—the combination of these three aspects—are extremely important in the current struggle for power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. This is the core of the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat; this is a temporary power organ for the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers to seize power from the hands of the capitalist-roaders within the Party under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Only with the "tripartite combination" can a genuine great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat be formed; only with the "tripartite combination" can the real power of the Party, government, finance, and culture be seized from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and power can be consolidated and a thorough victory in the struggle for power can be achieved. It can be said with certainty that in the struggle between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, if this problem is not solved, the problem of seizing and holding power cannot be solved. Even if power is seized, it cannot be consolidated.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines, many strong revolutionary rebel organizations have emerged, preparing a solid class force for the struggle for power. These revolutionary mass organizations should select the most representative of the revolutionary masses' interests, the most politically far-sighted, the most considerate of the overall situation, and the most able to carry out Chairman Mao's policies and principles as revolutionary pioneers to participate in the "tripartite combination" temporary power organ. However, to lead this great struggle for power, relying solely on the representatives of these revolutionary mass organizations is not enough.

The People's Liberation Army is a proletarian revolutionary army personally created and trained by Chairman Mao, a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the most reliable guarantee for the thorough victory of this struggle for power. The participation of the representatives of the local garrison in the "tripartite combination" temporary power organ will enable the broad revolutionary rebels to cooperate more closely with the entire garrison of the local People's Liberation Army, to decisively suppress counter-revolutionaries, and to quickly defeat the enemy's counter-revolutionary plots to seize power.

There are a large number of revolutionary leading cadres in the Party and government organs. In the past arduous years of struggle, they have struggled hard for the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people and have made contributions; for a long time, they have struggled against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; today, at the decisive moment of the struggle between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their representatives, they have once again firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, on the side of the revolutionary rebels, and united with the revolutionary masses to fight together. The practice of class struggle has shown that these leading comrades have a firm proletarian stand, a thorough determination to make revolution; they have rich experience in struggle, are politically mature, and have strong organizational abilities. They are good cadres tempered and tested in the long years of struggle under the cultivation and guidance of Chairman Mao, a precious asset of the Party. Their participation in the core leadership of the "tripartite combination" is very beneficial for seizing and holding power. Therefore, the role of revolutionary cadres who have been tempered for a long time in the struggle for power must be fully valued. Leading cadres who insist on the revolutionary line of the proletariat can completely become the backbone of the struggle for power and can completely become the leaders of the struggle for power.

In the process of implementing the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat with the "tripartite combination" as the core, in the process of seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, it is necessary to implement the cadre policy formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao. It is necessary to strictly distinguish between proletarian rulers and bourgeois rulers, between those who support and implement the revolutionary line of the proletariat and those who support and implement the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. The practice of not believing in and overthrowing all rulers indiscriminately is completely wrong; the idea and practice of opposing, excluding, and overthrowing everything without distinguishing right from wrong are completely contrary to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

For cadres, for rulers, we must also use Chairman Mao's method of class analysis and treat them differently. For those rulers who insist on the revolutionary line of the proletariat and take the socialist road, we should believe in them, support them, and cooperate closely with them in the struggle for power; for those rulers who take the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, we must resolutely oppose and thoroughly overthrow them. What is particularly worth noting in the current struggle for power is how to correctly treat those cadres who have made mistakes. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres," "we must be good at using cadres," "we must be good at cherishing cadres." For cadres who make mistakes, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and repeatedly refuse to change, we should adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity—criticism—unity." This is Chairman Mao's consistent thought and also the traditional policy of our Party. Only in this way can the cadres who made mistakes be sincerely convinced, and only in this way can the revolutionary masses of the proletariat gain the sincere support of the majority, and stand unshakably. "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party; all leading comrades at all levels must fully pay attention to this and never be careless." We believe that all genuine revolutionary rebels will certainly seriously implement the cadre policy formulated by Chairman Mao for us.

All revolutionary mass organizations, the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary cadres in the Party and government organs, let us unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, complete the struggle for power victoriously, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的一个好范例
    黑龙江省红色造反者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级的革命英雄气概和科学的战斗精神，在夺权斗争中创造了许多真正体现毛泽东思想的新经验，为伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，作出了宝贵的贡献。
    黑龙江红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验，有以下四点：
    第一，革命造反派，根据当地斗争的具体情况，鲜明的体现了党的方针政策，团结省委内执行毛主席正确路线的主要负责人，同人民解放军的主要负责人，三位一体，联合夺权。
    第二，在夺取省委的领导大权之前，首先把无产阶级革命的喉舌报社、电台和专政机关公安局，掌握在左派手里，为最后夺取反动的核心堡垒（被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派盘踞的省委），作好舆论准备，坚决镇压反革命活动，保证夺权斗争的顺利进行。
    第三，坚定地依靠被夺权单位内部的左派力量，团结中间力量，坚决打击最顽固的反动力量，来夺取政权，巩固政权。
    第四，夺权斗争的根本经验，归结到一点就是，毛泽东思想武装了左派队伍。左派队伍运用毛泽东思想，批判、纠正种种非无产阶级思想，因而顺利地指导了夺权斗争。
    这些经验，是比较全面的，成功的，是值得各地无产阶级革命派学习的。各地的无产阶级革命派，应当结合本地具体情况，创造性地应用这些经验。
    革命群众组织的真正的无产阶级革命派的代表，中国人民解放军当地驻军的代表，党政机关中的革命领导干部，这三方面结合起来，在当前无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，极端重要。它是无产阶级革命派大联合的核心，它是无产阶级和广大劳动人民在无产阶级专政条件下，向走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权的一种临时权力机构。
    只有“三结合”，才会形成真正的无产阶级革命派的大联合；只有“三结合”，才能从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里真正夺得党、政、财、文的实权，才能巩固政权，获得夺权斗争的彻底胜利。可以肯定地说，无产阶级革命派在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，不解决好这个问题，就不能解决夺权和掌权的问题，即使夺了权，也不能巩固。
    在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，涌现出了许多坚强的革命造反派组织，为夺权斗争准备了坚实的阶级队伍。这些革命群众组织应该选出最能代表革命群众利益，最有政治远见，最能顾全大局的，最能贯彻毛主席的方针政策的革命闯将，参加“三结合”的临时权力机构。但是，要领导好这场伟大的夺权斗争，光靠这些革命群众组织的代表是不行的。
    人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和教导出来的一支无产阶级革命化的队伍，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是这次夺权斗争取得彻底胜利的最可靠的保证。当地驻军的代表参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，广大革命造反派就能同解放军当地驻军的全体指战员更加密切配合、共同协作，就能坚决镇压反革命，迅速击败阶级敌人反夺权的阴谋活动。
    党政机关中大量的革命领导干部，在过去的艰苦斗争的岁月里，为了党和人民的革命事业，艰苦奋斗，立过功劳；长期以来，他们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行过斗争；今天，在无产阶级革命派同资产阶级及其代表人物的决战时刻，他们又坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，站在革命造反派一边，和革命群众相结合，共同战斗。阶级斗争的实践表明，这些领导同志有坚定的无产阶级立场，有彻底干革命的决心；他们斗争经验比较丰富，在政治上比较成熟，组织能力较强。他们是在毛主席的培养教导下，在多年的斗争实践中锻炼和考验出来的好干部，是党的宝贵财富。有他们参加“三结合”的核心领导，对于夺权和掌权都是十分有利的。因此，必须足够重视久经锻炼的革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用。坚持无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，完全可以成为夺权斗争的骨干，完全可以成为夺权斗争的领导。
    在实行以“三结合”为核心的无产阶级革命派大联合的过程中，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的过程中，必须贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席所制定的干部政策。一定要严格区分是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派，是拥护和执行无产阶级革命路线，还是拥护和执行资产阶级反动路线。那种认为只要是当权派，就一概不相信，就统统打倒的作法是完全错误的；那种不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的想法和作法，是完全违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。
    对于干部，对于当权派，我们同样必须运用毛主席的阶级分析方法，区别对待。对于那些坚持无产阶级革命路线、走社会主义道路的当权派，我们应该相信他们，拥护他们，支持他们，和他们密切配合进行夺权斗争；对于那些走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，我们就要坚决反对，彻底打倒。在当前的夺权斗争中，特别值得注意的，就是如何正确对待那些犯有错误的干部。毛主席教导我们说：“必须善于识别干部”，“必须善于使用干部”，“必须善于爱护干部”。对于犯错误的干部，只要他们不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针。这是毛主席的一贯思想，也是我们党的传统政策。只有这样，才能使犯错误的本人心悦诚服，也才能使无产阶级革命派取得大多数人的衷心拥护，使自己立于不败之地。“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”我们相信一切真正的革命造反派，一定能认真地执行毛主席给我们制定的干部政策。
    一切革命的群众组织，中国人民解放军广大的指战员，党政机关的革命干部，让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，联合起来，胜利地完成夺权斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
