A thunderous spring thunder roars across the sky! The poor and lower-middle peasants are full of fighting spirit, taking the lead in the revolution, and boldly advancing production. A thunderous spring thunder roars across the sky! Revolutionary cadres stand tall, with "dare" as their motto, charging forward, setting an example in everything they do. A thunderous spring thunder roars across the sky! Spring plowing and production are on the battlefield, with countless red flags waving, and vast fields of crops being transformed. A thunderous spring thunder roars across the sky! Chairman Mao steers the ship, guiding us along the revolutionary path, and socialism shines brightly.

Under the revolutionary banner, spring plowing is in full swing. The sun warms the earth, and the revolutionary banner reddened the sky.

"Grasp revolution, promote production," the highest directive spreads across the land. Under the revolutionary banner, spring plowing is in full swing. The poor and lower-middle peasants show their skills, with a wave of the red whip, a thousand plows pass through, and songs of plenty echo everywhere.

    春雷一声震天响
    吉青山春雷一声震天响！贫下中农斗志昂，大抓革命是先锋，猛促生产当闯将。春雷一声震天响！革命干部挺胸膛，
  “敢”字当头往前闯，事事处处做榜样。春雷一声震天响！春耕生产摆战场，千军万马红旗舞，万顷良田换新装。春雷一声震天响！毛主席掌舵指航向，沿着革命路线走，社会主义放光芒。革命旗下闹春耕孙振希麦苗返青春光暖，革命大旗染红天。
  “抓革命，促生产”，最高指示天下传。革命旗下闹春耕，贫下中农把身手显，红鞭一甩千犁过，歌声阵阵兆丰年。
