Absurd "Academician"

There is an "academician" in the Soviet Union named Frantsev who played a particularly enthusiastic role in the mad chorus of anti-China propaganda orchestrated by the Soviet revisionist leadership against our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last September, Frantsev published an article in the Soviet newspaper *Izvestia* titled "Revolution and Culture." It should be pointed out that Frantsev and his ilk have no right to discuss revolution and culture. In fact, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, genuine socialist culture has been severely suppressed and destroyed, while decadent and corrupt bourgeois culture has flourished, becoming a tool for capitalist restoration. In today's Soviet Union, the cultural realm is filled with all sorts of rubbish. Where is there any revolutionary spirit to be found? For Frantsev to go on and on about "revolution and culture" is not this absurd?

Frantsev said that China's Cultural Revolution is "not guiding the people to enrich their spiritual lives to the greatest extent, but rather making them impoverished and barren." Here, we advise Mr. Frantsev to recall how you have "enriched" the people's "spiritual lives" over the years!

Those "red-hot" works of yours, such as *The Fate of a Man* and *The Living and the Dead*, do nothing but exaggerate the horrors of war, preach personal "happiness," and promote the philosophy of betrayal. What else can they "enrich" in the people's "spiritual lives"?

The ballet *Swan Lake*, which you treasure so much, has been performed for decades, and it's always the same old thing! In this era of surging worldwide anti-imperialist struggle, what can *Swan Lake* offer a revolutionary besides leading people away from reality and corrupting them?

As for the films you have shown in recent years, how many poisonous weeds and "American way of life" products, how many Hollywood-style scenes are there? We really have no interest in calculating that. If these things can "enrich spiritual life," then they can only "enrich" the empty and ugly spiritual world of you aristocratic gentlemen.

Today, under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to sweep away all the trash that poisons the people from the cultural realm, so that literature, film, drama, music, dance, and all forms of art can serve proletarian politics, serve socialism, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Practice has proven that revolutionary Peking opera, ballet, symphonic music, and other forms have been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses, and literature and art have thus been reborn, presenting a brilliant prospect for development. So, who has made culture "enter a dead end," and who has made spiritual life increasingly "impoverished and barren"? Isn't it crystal clear?

Frantsev and his ilk maliciously slander and attack our Cultural Revolution, which only proves that this small clique of revisionist spiritual aristocrats has long since deviated from the revolutionary stance of the proletariat and become traitors to the proletariat!

In his article, Frantsev also solemnly declared that China's Cultural Revolution is to "isolate itself from the culture of all mankind."

What is "the culture of all mankind"? In class society, there is no such thing as a culture shared by all mankind. In today's world, there is socialist culture and capitalist culture. The "culture of all mankind" that Frantsev and his ilk worship is nothing but pure capitalist culture, imperialist culture. Look at the Soviet Union today: abstract art, impressionism, modernism, and fauvism are rampant, and rock 'n' roll and jazz are everywhere. You peddle these decayed and corrupt "cultural" junk everywhere, and you call it "the culture of all mankind." This is shameless to the extreme.

Let us tell you frankly! We not only want to "isolate" but also to completely destroy those capitalist and revisionist cultures that are used to corrupt revolutionary masses and prepare for capitalist restoration. We firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, on the one hand, thoroughly sweeping away the corrupt culture that serves all exploiting classes, and on the other hand, absorbing the essence of the culture created by the laboring people of all ages. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will definitely create a socialist culture that is unparalleled in all previous eras and extremely brilliant.

Finally, we warn Frantsev and his ilk: China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not something that you can slander. The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will inevitably occur in all countries of the world. The Soviet Union will be no exception. At that time, whether it is Frantsev or the things that Frantsev worships and praises, they will all be discarded by the Soviet people. History will prove this, and it will definitely prove this!

### 荒谬绝伦的“院士”

专栏：红卫兵谈天下大事

    荒谬绝伦的“院士”
    苏联有个叫弗兰采夫的“院士”，在苏修领导集团导演的疯狂反对我国无产阶级文化大革命的大合唱中，扮演了一个特别起劲的角色。
    弗兰采夫去年九月在苏联《消息报》上发表了一篇文章，题目叫做《革命与文化》。应当指出，弗兰采夫之流本来根本没有资格谈论什么革命与文化。事实上，在苏修领导集团的统治下，真正的社会主义文化，受到严重的摧残和压制，而资产阶级的腐朽没落的文化则大为泛滥，成为资本主义复辟的工具。在今日苏联的文化领域内，充满着乌七八糟的东西，哪里有什么革命的味道可言？弗兰采夫居然大谈特谈什么“革命与文化”，这岂不是荒谬绝伦的事吗？
    弗兰采夫说，中国的文化大革命是“不引导人民去最大限度地丰富精神生活，而是使之贫乏和干枯”。在这里，我们奉劝弗兰采夫先生回忆一下，你们这些年是怎么“丰富”人民的“精神生活”的！
    你们那些“红得发紫”的什么《一个人的遭遇》，什么《生者和死者》之类的东西，除了大肆渲染战争恐怖、宣扬个人“幸福”、鼓吹叛徒哲学之外，又能
  “丰富”人民的什么“精神生活”呢？
    被你们视如珍宝的芭蕾舞剧《天鹅湖》，已经演了几十年了，演来演去还是那个老样子！在当前这样一个全世界反帝斗争风起云涌的时代里，对于一个革命者说来，《天鹅湖》除了把人们引向远远脱离现实生活的境界，起腐蚀作用之外，又能使人感受些什么呢？
    至于你们这几年放映的影片中，究竟有多少毒草，多少“美国生活方式”的货色，多少好莱坞式的镜头，我们实在没有兴致去计算了。如果说这些东西也能“丰富精神生活”的话，那只能说是“丰富”你们这班贵族老爷们那种空虚的丑恶的精神世界。
    今天，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的一个内容，就是要把一切毒害人民的破烂货，从文化领域中统统扫除掉，使文学、电影、戏剧、歌舞……等一切形式的艺术都能够为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义服务，为工农兵服务。实践已经证明，经过革命的京戏、芭蕾舞、交响乐，获得了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎，文学艺术也由此得到了新生，出现了光辉灿烂的发展前景。那么，到底是谁使文化“走进了死胡同”，是谁使精神生活越来越“贫乏和干枯”，岂不是一清二楚的事情吗？弗兰采夫之流对我国的文化大革命大肆诬蔑和攻击，这只能证明他们这一小撮修正主义的精神贵族早已背离了无产阶级的革命立场，成为无产阶级的叛徒！
    弗兰采夫在他的文章中，还煞有介事地说什么中国的文化大革命是要“与全人类的文化隔绝”。
    什么叫“全人类的文化”？在阶级社会中，根本没有什么全人类共有的文化。在当今世界上，有社会主义文化，有资本主义文化。弗兰采夫之流为之拜倒的“全人类的文化”，不是别的，就是地地道道的资本主义文化、帝国主义文化。请看今日之苏联，什么抽象派、印象派、现代派、野兽派大量泛滥，什么阿飞舞、爵士乐到处流行。你们把这些腐朽不堪的、没落的“文化”破烂拿来到处贩卖，还美其名曰“全人类的文化”，真是无耻到了极点。
    老实告诉你们吧！对于那些作为腐蚀革命群众，准备资本主义复辟的资本主义文化和修正主义文化，我们不仅要“隔绝”，而且要统统破坏掉。我们坚定地根据毛主席的教导，一方面彻底扫除为一切剥削阶级服务的腐败的文化，一方面吸收历代劳动人民所创造的文化的精华。经过无产阶级文化大革命，我们一定能够创造出为过去一切时代望尘莫及的极其辉煌灿烂的社会主义文化。
    最后，我们还要正告弗兰采夫之流：中国的无产阶级文化大革命，绝非你们这班家伙所能诋毁得了的。社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度。无产阶级文化大革命，也迟早要在世界各国发生。苏联也不会例外。到那时，不论是弗兰采夫还是弗兰采夫所崇拜、所吹捧的东西，都将被苏联人民所抛弃。历史将会证明这一点，也必定会证明这一点！    北京地质学院东方红公社    一兵
