The People of the World Support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Kāi'ěr, Sudan

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been going on for nine months now. During these nine months, hundreds of millions of people around the world have been watching the events unfolding in China. Revolutionary parties, revolutionary organizations, and billions of revolutionary people around the world welcome China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically support it, praise it, wish it success, and want to learn from it. Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists viciously attack it. The revolutionary people of the world stand on the side of the Chinese people, while the Soviet revisionists stand on the side of imperialism and reactionaries. Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Chairman Mao also said: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing," and "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, denounces us as worthless, that is even better, because it proves that we have not only drawn a clear line with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great success."

Chairman Mao said: "After the armed enemies are eliminated, the unarmed enemies still exist." Currently, modern revisionists are so rampant in attacking and slandering the Chinese Cultural Revolution because they fear that their fate will be the same as that of the unarmed enemies.

In the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has given the people great democratic rights, and the people have been fully mobilized. This is unprecedented in the history of the international communist movement and something that no other country has done. Only a truly great leader like Chairman Mao could propose such a great thing because he truly believes in the masses. But how can those who propose a "party of the whole people" and a "state of the whole people" give the people such democratic rights? If they did, they would immediately be overthrown by the Soviet people. Think about it, if China also believed in a "party of the whole people" and a "state of the whole people," what would happen? The answer is simple and clear: the ghosts and monsters in China would come to power, suppress the Chinese people's revolution, and change China's color. Then, what would happen to the fate of the world revolution? It is very clear. From this, we can see that the Chinese Cultural Revolution has great significance.

This Cultural Revolution is a revolution against the unarmed enemies. It is a development of Marxism-Leninism, especially in the issues of the party and the state, and a great contribution to Marxism-Leninism.

Before the Cultural Revolution, the U.S. imperialists placed their hopes on the third generation in China, hoping to restore capitalism. However, it is noteworthy that it is precisely this third generation that first fired at the capitalist roaders in power within the party during the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards are not tall, and I thought they would only change street names and cut off braids. In fact, they changed the times. Chairman Mao just chose this generation, which is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. Now it is clear what the third generation is like, and the hopes of the U.S. imperialists have been dashed. The Chinese Cultural Revolution provides a valuable experience for the people of socialist countries—to overthrow the power of the bourgeoisie in power. With the experience of the Chinese people, the struggle for other socialist countries will be easier. The Chinese Cultural Revolution has turned China into a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. The Cultural Revolution, in just a few months, has greatly popularized Mao Zedong Thought, which is something that tens of thousands of political and ideological schools cannot achieve.

Mao Zedong Thought has once again enriched Marxism-Leninism, telling the people how to prevent the country from changing color, primarily by revolutionizing people's thinking.

    全世界革命人民支持中国文化大革命
    苏丹  凯尔
    中国的文化大革命到现在已经九个月了。在这九个月中，全世界千百万人民都在注视着中国发生的事件。世界上革命政党、革命组织和亿万革命人民都欢迎中国的文化大革命，热烈地支持它、赞扬它，祝愿它成功，并且要向它学习。而美帝、苏修却恶毒攻击它。全世界革命人民都站在中国人民一边，而苏修却站在帝国主义、反动派一边。毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”毛主席还说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”。目前现代修正主义者如此猖狂地攻击和污蔑中国文化大革命，因为他们害怕自己的命运也会和不拿枪的敌人的命运一样。
    毛主席在文化大革命中给人民大民主权利，人民已经充分动员起来了，这是国际共产主义运动中史无前例的，也是任何国家所没有的事情。这样伟大的事情，只有真正伟大的领袖毛主席才能够提出，因为他是真正相信群众的。而提出“全民党”、“全民国家”的那些人怎么能给人民这样的民主权利呢？如果他们这样做的话，那他们马上会被苏联人民推翻。我们想一想，如果中国也相信“全民党”、“全民国家”，中国会发生什么事情？回答是很简单，也是很清楚的，中国的牛鬼蛇神就会掌权，镇压中国人民革命，使中国变颜色。这样，世界革命的命运将会如何，不是很清楚的吗？由此可见，中国文化大革命是具有伟大的意义的。
    这次文化大革命，是对不拿枪的敌人的革命。这是对马列主义的发展，特别是在党和国家问题上，是对马列主义的巨大贡献。
    文化大革命开始以前，美帝把希望寄托在中国的第三代身上，妄想复辟资本主义。但值得注意的是，正是这第三代，在文化大革命中首先向党内走资本主义道路的当权派开火。红卫兵个子不高，我当时只以为他们改改街道名字，剪剪辫子，其实，是他们改变了时代。毛主席刚好选中了这一代，这对美帝国主义是一个沉重的打击。现在对第三代看得很清楚了，美帝希望破灭了。中国文化大革命给社会主义国家人民提供了一个宝贵的经验——推翻资产阶级当权派的权力。有了中国人民这个经验，对其他社会主义国家来说，斗争就比较容易了。中国文化大革命使中国变成一个学习毛泽东思想的大学校。文化大革命只用几个月的时间，就使毛泽东思想大大地普及了，这是成千上万个政治科学学校所办不到的。
    毛泽东思想再一次地丰富了马列主义，它告诉人民使国家不变颜色的办法，首先是使人的思想革命化。
