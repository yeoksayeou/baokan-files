Chairman Mao has written to us!

"Chairman Mao has written to us!"

"The Central Committee of the Communist Party has written to us!"

The joyous news of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Countryside" spread rapidly throughout the entire village. People gathered around the loudspeaker, quietly listening to the broadcast from the Central People's Radio Station. At 8:30 PM on February 21st, what an extraordinary moment!

This letter is a great call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the countryside!

This letter is a great mobilization order for the entire countryside to seize the revolution and promote production, launching a spring production campaign!

This letter speaks the words in our hearts, the words in the hearts of the revolutionary cadres. Chairman Mao is with us, the Party Central Committee is with us. Our hearts are truly filled with excitement. People enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!"

"'Seize the revolution and promote production'—this is Chairman Mao's great call, the Party Central Committee's great call. We will resolutely respond and resolutely carry it out!" As people left the loudspeaker, a firm voice echoed through the crowd.

What a restless night! The enthusiastic atmosphere filled the small village of less than 200 households on the outskirts of Taiyuan City. The joyous mood surged in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Forward Brigade. They gathered in groups of five or eight, waving their strong hands, discussing and arguing, determined to fire the first shot of spring plowing as the first gift to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee this spring. Several young poor and lower-middle peasants couldn't wait, raising their voices joyfully. They wanted to unite all the youth in the village into a force to seize the revolution and promote production, proposing to establish a "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" combat team. Immediately, the brigade leader Han Fusheng, the political deputy team leader Li Xiangyang, the deputy team leader Xu Liang, the deputy platoon leader Li Yuzhen, and the secretary of the youth league Yan Yuxiang became the initiators of the "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" combat team. When they discussed drafting the manifesto, everyone said, February 21st, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee wrote to us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, this is a day of great significance. Thus, they changed the name of the combat team to the "Defend Mao Zedong Thought February 21st Combat Team." The manifesto passionately expressed their determination. They would follow Chairman Mao's words, resolutely make the revolution, trample the capitalist roaders and monsters and demons underfoot, shoulder the heavy burden, and achieve double victories in revolution and production! This is the spirit of our poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. This is the style of our poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. It is these descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants whose chests burn with the fire of revolution and whose bodies are full of boundless energy.

The night deepened. More than 40 new and old cadres of the brigade gathered in the brigade office to discuss the arrangements for spring production. This was a new response to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" among the cadres. Throughout this winter, these revolutionary cadres had always fought and labored alongside the community members, resisting the influence of the economicist black wind, actively participating in winter production, and advancing with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary community members towards the depth and breadth of production.

Fertilizing, accumulating fertilizer, leveling the land, spring planting, and the arrangement of various crops and labor force organization were all thoroughly discussed. It was proposed to mobilize community members to open up new sources of fertilizer, with each production team accumulating an additional 80 carts of fertilizer. This new production plan was once again enriched and improved. The young secretary of the party branch, Jia Zhugen, proposed to convene a community meeting the next evening to discuss and fully boost the morale of the community members. This proposal was immediately unanimously approved by everyone. This meeting was truly timely! It was truly good!

The night was very deep.

Li Baogui, the leader of the Red Guards, stepped into his home with a heart full of excitement. His father, Li Jixiu, had not yet gone to bed and was waiting by the stove, smoking. Tonight, this old poor peasant, whose family nearly starved to death before liberation, could not sleep after hearing the voice of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. He thought: Since liberation, Chairman Mao has led us in making the revolution and building the country, making us poor and lower-middle peasants hold the reins and grasp the sword, building a red homeland. Today, Chairman Mao wrote to us poor and lower-middle peasants, calling on us to "seize the revolution and promote production," truly speaking to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The revolution relies on us, production also relies on us. If we don't do it, can we let the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists do it? No, no, we must not let those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists turn things upside down. We must make production flourish!

Li Baogui entered the house, full of words to say to his father. He shared his ideas about leading the Red Guards to "seize the revolution and promote production" and the measures discussed at the brigade production meeting tonight. Thus, father and son sat by the stove, opening their hearts and chatting...

The east is red, the sun is rising. The dawn reddened the fields and the village. A tense battle day began. Spring has come. The hot scene: red flags, songs, quotations, cars and horses on the road, 95% of the male and female labor force in the entire village have joined the spring plowing production campaign, people carrying hoes and shovels, rushing to various battlefields...

    毛主席给咱来信啦！
    贺春喜
    “毛主席给咱们来信啦！”
    “党中央给咱们来信啦！”
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》的喜讯，飞快地在全村传播开来，人们集聚在喇叭筒下，静静地听着中央人民广播电台的广播。二月二十一日晚八时三十分，这是个多么不平常的时刻啊！
    这封信是毛主席和党中央对贫下中农和人民公社各级干部发出的伟大号召！
    这封信是全国农村抓革命，促生产，掀起春耕生产热潮的伟大动员令！
    这封信说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，说出了我们革命干部的心里话。毛主席跟咱们在一起，党中央跟咱们在一起。我们的心里真是激动万分。人们热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”
    “‘抓革命，促生产’这是毛主席的伟大号召，党中央的伟大号召，咱们坚决响应，坚决照办！”在离开喇叭筒时，人群中传出坚定的声音。
    这真是一个不平静的夜晚啊！热烈的气氛充满着太原市郊这个不到二百户人家的小村庄。欢腾的情绪激荡着前进大队贫下中农的胸怀。他们五个一伙，八个一簇，挥舞着粗壮的手，议论着，争辩着，要打响春耕第一炮，作为今春给毛主席、党中央的第一份礼物。几个贫下中农的后生耐不住了，欢喜地放高了声调，他们要把全村青年团结成为抓革命、促生产的突击力量，提议建立一支“抓革命，促生产”战斗队。当下，生产大队长韩福生、生产队政治副队长李向阳、生产队副队长许亮、民兵副连长李玉珍、团支部书记阎玉香，就成了“抓革命，促生产”战斗队的发起人。当他们讨论起草宣言的时候，大家说，二月二十一日，毛主席、党中央给咱贫下中农和革命干部来信，这是个非常有纪念意义的日子。于是就把战斗队的名字改称为“捍卫毛泽东思想二·二一战斗队”。宣言热情地表示了他们的决心。他们听毛主席的话，坚决闹革命，要把走资本主义道路的当权派、牛鬼蛇神踩在脚下，把重担一肩挑起来，夺取革命生产双胜利！这就是我们贫下中农和革命干部的胸怀，这就是我们贫下中农和革命干部的风格。就是这些贫下中农的后代，胸膛里燃烧着革命的火，浑身充满使不完的劲。
    夜深了。大队部里集聚了四十多名大队的新老干部，一同商量安排春季生产。这是响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，在干部中的一个新的回响。这一冬来，这些革命干部始终和社员战斗在一起，劳动在一起，抵制了经济主义黑风的影响，积极投入了冬季生产，和广大贫下中农、革命群众一起，向生产的深度和广度进军。
    送肥，积肥，平整土地，春种，各类作物种植安排和劳动力的组织，都一一作了充分的讨论。提出要发动社员开辟新的肥源，每个生产队再增积八十车肥料。这个新的生产方案又一次得到充实和提高。年轻的党支部书记贾柱根提议，明晚就召开社员大会讨论，让社员把劲头鼓得足足的。这个提议立刻得到大家的一致通过。这个会开得真及时！开得真好！
    夜，很深了。
    李宝贵这个红卫兵队长带着兴致勃勃的心情，跨进自家门槛。他的父亲李继勣还没有睡下，守候在炉边抽烟。今夜，这个在解放前全家差点儿饿死的老贫农，听到毛主席、党中央的声音，怎么也睡不着觉。他想：打解放以来，毛主席领导咱们闹革命、搞建设，就是叫咱贫下中农掌好印把子，握紧刀把子，建设红色江山。今天，毛主席给咱们贫下中农写信，叫咱们“抓革命，促生产”，可真是说到俺贫下中农心窝窝里了。革命靠咱，生产也靠咱，咱不干，还能让地富反坏右分子干吗？不能，不能，就是不准那些地富反坏右分子翻天，咱要把生产搞个热火朝天！
    李宝贵进了家，满腹心里话要跟父亲说。他把领导红卫兵“抓革命，促生产”的想法说了一遍，把今夜大队生产会议讨论的措施说了一遍。于是父子俩围在炉边，打开了话匣子，畅叙起来……
    东方红，太阳升。朝霞染红了田野、村庄。紧张战斗的一天开始了。春天来了。这热气腾腾的景象：红旗、歌声、语录牌，大路上车水马龙，全村百分之九十五的男女劳力投入了春耕生产热潮中，人们扛?荷锹，向各个战地急急奔去！……（原载《山西日报》）
