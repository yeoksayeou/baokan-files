The Revolutionary Committee of Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province issued a mobilization order on February 13, calling on all rural red rebels in the province to firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They must unite revolutionary forces from all sides, mobilize all positive factors, and with great revolutionary enthusiasm, seize the time, take the initiative, and ensure a good spring ploughing and sowing season to achieve a bumper harvest this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 13: The Revolutionary Committee of Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province issued a "Mobilization Order for Launching a Great Spring Ploughing Campaign" on February 13. The full text is as follows:

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the rural areas of our province is in a great situation. The red rebels on the agricultural front have risen up in rebellion. A historic storm of great unity and great seizure of power is sweeping across the entire province, like a sudden storm, irresistible. Under the impetus of the Cultural Revolution, spring ploughing and production have also taken comprehensive action, marking a good start. This heralds a new, comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

"Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy." The success or failure of agriculture directly affects the entire national economy. Our province is one of the major grain production bases in the country, bearing the great political task of supporting national socialist construction and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

Now that spring ploughing and sowing are approaching, spring ploughing and production must be accelerated. This is a critical moment for achieving a bumper harvest this year. Red rebels and the broad masses of revolutionary people must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and vow to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

At this critical juncture of spring ploughing and production, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have colluded with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to hatch new conspiracies, trying to sabotage spring ploughing and production with evil intentions. They are creating conditions for their own complete collapse and ultimate doom. We, the broad masses of red rebels, must timely expose any tricks and conspiracies of the class enemies, expose them under the sun, and fight them down, fight them over, and fight them to stink. To ensure the smooth progress of spring ploughing and production, the Revolutionary Committee of Red Rebels in Heilongjiang Province specially issues the following mobilization order for spring ploughing and production:

1. Firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in rural areas is the fundamental prerequisite for carrying out spring ploughing and production. Red rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implement the "Sixteen Points" of the Cultural Revolution and the "Ten Points" for rural cultural revolution, grasp the overall direction of the movement, continuously expand the leftist forces, firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite the middle peasants, actively carry out the struggle for power, thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, and complete the historical tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We vow to build the vast rural areas of our province into a world of red Mao Zedong Thought.

While carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must also focus on spring ploughing and production. A true red rebel must be both a pioneer in revolution and a trailblazer in production. Generally, production should be carried out during the day and revolution at night. Red rebels and the broad masses of revolutionary people must heighten their revolutionary vigilance and prevent a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party from inciting peasants to seize power in the cities. In the future, if such reactionary behavior is discovered, they must be firmly exposed and dealt with as active counter-revolutionaries. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must be strictly controlled, allowing them to behave only honestly and not to speak or act recklessly. Those who violate the law will be severely punished.

2. Emphasize proletarian politics and grasp living thoughts. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental changes in the social and economic system." We must always emphasize proletarian politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry out the thought revolutionization of the people.

Red rebels and the broad masses of revolutionary people must prioritize the interests of the state and the collective, consider the overall situation, obey the whole, stand high, look far, reside in the countryside, and look at the world. They must overcome selfishness and individualism. They must learn from Dazhai's spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, set ambitious goals to change the world, become masters of nature, not slaves, and overcome the idea of relying on heaven for food. They must unite revolutionary forces from all sides, mobilize all positive factors, and with great revolutionary enthusiasm, carry out spring ploughing and production.

For cadres, we must use Chairman Mao's method of class analysis to distinguish between them. Revolutionary cadres must stand out, firmly stand on the side of true red rebels, boldly carry out work, and lead spring ploughing and production. Cadres who have made general mistakes must accept criticism from the masses, actively admit their mistakes, seriously examine themselves, lighten their load, and work with red rebels and the broad masses of revolutionary people to lead production, make amends for their mistakes, and absolutely not have the idea of dropping the burden and lying down. Cadres who have made serious mistakes but are willing to repent should go to the revolutionary masses, work hard, and make amends for their mistakes. For a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they must be fought down, fought over, and fought to stink, so that they can never rise again.

The entire rural areas of the province must strictly implement the Party Central Committee's "Notice on Protecting the Achievements of the Four Cleanups in Rural Areas." The Four Cleanups carried out according to the "Ten Points" and "Twenty-Three Points" are in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad masses of rural red rebels must heighten their revolutionary vigilance, firmly defend the achievements of the Four Cleanups, and absolutely not allow those unqualified cadres and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to reverse the situation, thus sabotaging the Cultural Revolution and spring ploughing and production. Those who attempt to reverse the situation must be immediately dealt with according to law and severely punished.

3. Take active actions and concentrate forces to launch a great spring ploughing and production campaign. The characteristic of agricultural production in our province is one season per year, with a short frost-free period. Especially last winter and this spring, there was little snow, and this spring is short, with the sowing period advanced. If sowing is not carried out in time, it will affect the entire year's harvest. Therefore, red rebels and the broad masses of revolutionary people must immediately take action to carry out spring ploughing. They must use the method of great democracy to quickly implement production plans and increase production measures, and arrange crops to specific plots. Currently, all forces must be concentrated to rush the delivery of fertilizer, quickly repair water conservancy projects that benefit the current year, actively prepare for drought resistance, and focus on seed selection, germination tests, and exchange work. They must also vigorously carry out the maintenance of agricultural machinery, strengthen the feeding and epidemic prevention of draft animals, and ensure that all preparations are made before spring sowing, so that everything is ready and only waiting for the plough.

Local industries, commerce, supply and marketing, banks, transportation, and other departments must prioritize supporting agriculture and ensure the supply and allocation of all production and living materials needed for spring ploughing and production.

Government agencies, schools, and other enterprises and institutions must organize forces to systematically enter rural areas, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the Party's policies, and participate in production labor. Revolutionary teachers and students who go to rural areas for revolutionary connections must actively participate in spring ploughing and production and must not interfere with production. Knowledgeable youth who return to the cities after going to the countryside must immediately return to their production positions in the countryside, carry out revolution on the spot, and must not stay outside and affect spring ploughing and production.

4. Seize the time, take the initiative, and ensure good spring ploughing and sowing. During the spring sowing period, labor must be allocated to concentrate superior forces for annihilation battles. Sowing must be done at the right time, shorten the sowing period, strive for a full seedling rate, and achieve high quality and high standards to lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

5. Establish and strengthen the leadership of production teams. Spring ploughing is a key season for agricultural production, "seize the opportunity, time waits for no man." Local leftist revolutionary organizations must seize the power of production, strengthen the production team, and establish a production command system to ensure the orderly conduct of spring ploughing and production.

All red rebels on the agricultural front of the province, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, greet the new dawn of the Northeast, grasp revolution, promote production, launch a great spring ploughing and production campaign, and strive for a bumper harvest this year!

    黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会发布动员令
    迎着东北新曙光　掀起备耕大高潮
    全省农村红色造反者必须坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，团结各方面的革命力量，调动一切积极因素，鼓足革命干劲，抢时间，争主动，搞好春耕春播，夺取今年农业大丰收。
    新华社哈尔滨十三日电　黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会十三日发布“关于掀起备耕生产高潮的动员令”。全文如下：
    当前我省农村无产阶级文化大革命是一派大好形势。广大农业战线上的红色造反者起来造反了。一场史无前例的大联合、大夺权的红色革命风暴席卷着全省，其势如暴风骤雨、锐不可挡。在文化大革命的推动下，备耕生产也全面行动起来了，有了一个良好开端。这预示着今年农业生产将出现一个新的全面的大跃进。
    “农业是国民经济的基础”。农业搞得好坏，对整个国民经济发生直接影响。我省是全国重要的粮食生产基地之一，担负着支援全国社会主义建设、支援世界人民革命斗争的巨大政治任务。
    现在春耕播种即将到来，备耕生产急需加紧进行，这是关系夺取今年农业大丰收的关键时刻。红色造反者和广大革命群众必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，挑起革命和生产两副重担，誓夺革命生产双胜利。
    在春耕生产的紧要关头，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子，耍弄新阴谋，千方百计地妄图以破坏春耕生产的罪恶手段，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们这样干，是在为自己的彻底垮台和最后灭亡制造条件。我们广大红色造反者要及时识破阶级敌人的任何阴谋诡计，把他们暴露在光天化日之下，斗垮、斗倒、斗臭。为确保春耕生产的顺利进行，黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会，特发布备耕生产动员令：
    一、坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召：“抓革命，促生产”。搞好农村无产阶级文化大革命是搞好备耕生产的根本前提。红色造反者必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行无产阶级文化大革命的“十六条”和农村文化大革命的“十条”，掌握运动的大方向，不断地壮大左派队伍，坚定地依靠贫下中农，团结中农，积极开展夺权斗争，彻底粉碎反革命经济主义，完成一斗二批三改的历史任务，誓把我省广大农村建成红彤彤的毛泽东思想新世界。
    在搞好无产阶级文化大革命的同时，一定要抓好备耕生产。一个真正的红色造反者，必须既是革命中的先锋，又是生产上的闯将。适应当前备耕生产的特点，一般地以白天搞生产，晚上闹革命。红色造反者和广大革命群众必须提高革命警惕，严防一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派为了保自己，煽动农民进城搞反夺权斗争。今后，如发现这种反动行为，要坚决把他们揪出来，以现行反革命论处。对地、富、反、坏、右分子，要严加管制，只许他们老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动，违者依法严办。
    二、突出无产阶级政治，抓好活思想。毛主席教导我们说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”我们必须时刻突出无产阶级政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大搞人的思想革命化。
    红色造反者和广大革命群众，必须以国家、集体利益为重，顾全大局，服从整体，站得高，看得远，身居农村，放眼世界，克服自私自利的本位主义和个人主义。要学习大寨艰苦奋斗，自力更生的革命精神，树立改天换地的雄心壮志，做大自然的主人，不做大自然的奴隶，克服靠天吃饭的思想。要团结各方面的革命力量，调动一切积极因素，鼓足革命干劲，搞好备耕生产。
    对于干部，必须运用毛主席的阶级分析的方法，区别对待。革命干部要挺身而出，坚定地站在真正的红色造反者一边，大胆地进行工作，领导好备耕生产。犯有一般错误的干部，要接受群众的批评，主动承认错误，认真检查，轻装上阵，和红色造反者、广大革命群众一道革命，领导好生产，将功补过，绝不应有撂挑子、躺倒不干的思想。犯有严重错误，但是愿意改悔的干部，应该到革命群众中去，好好劳动，好好工作，将功赎罪。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，必须将他们斗垮、斗倒、斗臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    全省农村必须不折不扣地贯彻执行党中央“关于保卫农村四清运动成果的通知”。按照“前十条”和“二十三条”开展的四清运动，执行的是毛主席的革命路线。广大农村红色造反者必须提高革命警惕，坚决捍卫四清成果，绝不允许那些四不清干部和地、富、反、坏、右分子翻案，从而破坏文化大革命和春耕生产，如有反攻倒算者，立即法办，严加惩处。
    三、积极行动，集中力量掀起备耕生产高潮。我省农业生产特点是，一年一季，无霜期短，尤其是去冬今春雪少，今年春脖子短，播种期提前，如不及时播种将影响全年收成。因此，红色造反者和广大革命群众必须立即行动起来，搞好备耕。要用大民主的方法，迅速落实生产计划，落实增产措施，作物安排要落实到地块上。目前要集中一切力量，突击送粪，迅速抢修当年受益的水利工程，积极做好抗旱准备，抓紧种子精选、发芽试验和串换工作，大力进行农机具检修，加强耕畜的饲养管理和防疫，保证在春播前做好一切准备工作，万事俱备，只等开犁。
    地方工业、商业、供销、银行、交通运输等部门，要把支援农业放在首位，保证春耕生产所需要的一切生产资料、生活资料的供应和调拨工作。
    机关、学校和其他事业、企业单位，都要组织力量，有计划地深入农村，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，参加生产劳动。到农村进行革命串连的革命师生要积极参加春耕生产，绝不能妨碍生产。回到城市的上山下乡的知识青年，要立即返回农村的生产岗位，就地闹革命，绝不能停留在外面，影响备耕生产。
    四、抢时间，争主动，保证搞好春耕播种。春播时，要搞好劳力调配，集中优势兵力打歼灭战。要适时播种，缩短播期，争取一次全苗，达到高质量，高标准，为今年农业丰收打下良好基础。
    五、建立和健全领导生产的班子。春耕是农业生产的一个关键性季节，“机不可失，时不再来”。各地左派革命组织，要掌握生产大权，强化生产班子，建立起生产指挥系统，上通下达，保证春耕生产有秩序的进行。
    全省农业战线上的红色造反者，广大贫下中农、革命职工、革命干部、革命师生，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛主席和党中央的领导下，迎着东北的新曙光，抓革命，促生产，掀起备耕生产大高潮，为夺取今年农业大丰收而奋斗！
