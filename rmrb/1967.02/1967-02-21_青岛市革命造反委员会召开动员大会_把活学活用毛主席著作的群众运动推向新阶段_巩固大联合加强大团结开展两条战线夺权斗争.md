The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee held a mobilization meeting on February 17 to promote the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, conduct a rectification campaign, and eliminate all non-proletarian thoughts. The meeting called on all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city to resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and build the revolutionary rebel forces into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready army.

More than 1,300 representatives from various revolutionary rebel organizations across the city attended the meeting. The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee representative delivered a rectification mobilization speech at the meeting and read out the "Decision of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee on Conducting a Rectification Campaign in All Revolutionary Rebel Organizations in the City" and an open letter from the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee to all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city titled "Overthrow the 'self,' rectify the style, and achieve new great victories!" (see page 2).

The report, decision, and open letter presented at the meeting analyzed the current revolutionary situation in Qingdao and pointed out that as the struggle deepens and the status of the proletarian revolutionaries changes, various non-proletarian erroneous tendencies are increasingly exposed. Due to the achievements and victories, some organizations, especially some leaders, have fostered anarchism and ultra-democracy, sectarianism and factionalism, individualism, the pursuit of fame and profit, and the desire for personal glory. These erroneous thoughts are highly harmful; they are corroding the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary left, undermining the unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and seriously hindering the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. These erroneous thoughts provide openings for the enemy. The enemy is using these erroneous thoughts to infiltrate, divide, and create splits, disrupting the revolutionary ranks, and undermining the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and undermining the new proletarian power we have established. This is a major issue that we currently face and urgently need to solve in order to consolidate and expand the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, strengthen the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and consolidate the new proletarian power.

The meeting pointed out that we are currently engaged in a two-front struggle to seize power: on one hand, we are implementing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road; on the other hand, we are seizing power from the 'self' in the minds of the proletarian revolutionaries. The former is the direction of the movement; the latter is the prerequisite for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces and the most important guarantee for seizing and holding power well. The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee decided to conduct a comprehensive rectification campaign in all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city to consolidate and expand the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, strengthen the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and successfully carry out the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and consolidate the new proletarian power.

In pointing out the purpose of the rectification and proposing the requirements for the rectification, the meeting called on all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further strengthen the consciousness of class struggle, sharpen their eyes, distinguish between friends and enemies, prevent enemy sabotage, purify the revolutionary ranks, and enhance the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organizations. Break down the 'self,' establish the 'public,' unite the majority, and jointly oppose the enemy. All proletarian revolutionaries should unite and rally under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a comprehensive struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and manage and control the power that has been seized. Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instructions, seize the revolution, promote production, save money for the revolution, turn the great spiritual power of Mao Zedong Thought into great material power, and repel the counter-revolutionary economicist backlash. The meeting also called on all proletarian revolutionary fighters in the city to take Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" as mottos, and while transforming the objective world, also transform the subjective world. They should regard themselves as both a force for revolution and an object of revolution, dare to carry out a revolution in their souls, dare to seize power from the 'self' in their minds, and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions. Through the rectification, build the proletarian revolutionary forces into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready revolutionary army.

The meeting also required all revolutionary rebel organizations in the city to link the rectification and study with the actual situation of their units during the rectification and study, and achieve targeted results. They must correct the erroneous idea that the current struggle is intense and work is busy, and oppose the rectification and study to the struggle to seize power. They must ensure that the more acute and complex the class struggle is and the busier the work is, the more they must strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works.

To help the revolutionary left better link the actual situation during the rectification campaign, the meeting also made a specific analysis of the current situation of the proletarian revolutionaries in the city seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and pointed out the direction of the struggle to various revolutionary rebel organizations: (1) Those currently seizing power should first learn from others' experiences and lessons, pay attention to uniting the majority of revolutionary left organizations with clear banners, correctly handle cadres according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, learn from and promote the good experience of the "three-in-one combination" in Heilongjiang, implement true great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and seize the party, government, financial, and cultural powers held by the power-holders taking the capitalist road. (2) Those facing counter-seizure of power must use class analysis, sharpen their eyes, distinguish between friends and enemies, unite genuine revolutionary forces, isolate and strike at a handful of reactionaries, expose their plots, and condemn and overthrow them. (3) Some units have seen the power-holders taking the capitalist road and conservatives falsely seize power. Therefore, the seizure of power must first be analyzed from a class perspective to see who has seized power. If conservatives have falsely seized power, it must be firmly opposed. The erroneous metaphysical view that any seizure of power is the correct direction must be corrected. The revolutionary left forces in the unit must be organized to win over and unite the majority of intermediate forces, isolate a handful of reactionaries, and seize the power. (4) Those in the stage of consolidating the new proletarian power must sum up the experiences and lessons from the previous stage of seizing power, correctly handle revolutionary cadres and deceived masses, and promote the good experience of the "three-in-one combination." They must prevent the emergence of various non-proletarian tendencies such as arrogance and complacency after seizing power due to the change in status. They must be highly vigilant against falling into the abyss of the new bourgeois reactionary line after seizing power. They must manage and firmly hold the power that has been seized.

The meeting expressed its firm belief that under the intimate care and support of Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, the proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao will definitely, through this great rectification campaign, persist in what is good for the people and correct what is wrong for the people. The proletarian revolutionary forces will definitely become more prosperous, purer, more consolidated, and stronger, forming an irresistible cultural revolution army. This army will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further unite, thoroughly smash the old world, and build a new Qingdao that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    青岛市革命造反委员会召开动员大会
    把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段  巩固大联合加强大团结开展两条战线夺权斗争
    按照毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部，学习和推广黑龙江“三结合”的好经验；在毛泽东思想旗帜下，团结大多数，建成一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军
    新华社青岛二十日电　青岛市革命造反委员会在十七日召开了活学活用毛主席著作整风动员大会。大会号召全市各革命造反组织，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，开展整风运动，清除一切非无产阶级思想，把革命造反派队伍建设成为一支非常无产阶级化的革命大军。
    参加这次大会的，有全市各条战线各革命造反组织的一千三百多名代表。青岛市革命造反委员会代表在会上作了整风动员报告，并且宣读了《青岛市革命造反委员会关于在全市革命造反组织中开展整风运动的决定》和青岛市革命造反委员会给全市革命造反组织的一封题为《打倒私字，整顿作风，夺取新的伟大胜利！》的公开信（见第二版）。
    大会上所作的报告和宣读的决定、公开信，分析了当前青岛市大好的革命形势，并且指出，随着斗争的深入发展和无产阶级革命派的地位的改变，形形色色的非无产阶级错误思想倾向正日益暴露出来。由于取得了成绩和胜利，在一些组织中，特别是在一些领导人中，滋长了无政府主义和极端民主化，滋长了宗派主义和小团体主义，滋长了个人主义、名利观念和风头主义等等。这些错误思想危害性极大，它正在腐蚀着革命左派的革命斗志，破坏着无产阶级革命派的团结，严重地妨碍了无产阶级革命派的大联合。这些错误思想，给敌人提供了进攻的缺口。敌人正在利用这些错误思想，打进来、拉出去，挑拨离间，制造分裂，搅乱革命阵营，破坏无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，破坏我们已经建立的无产阶级新政权。这是当前巩固和扩大无产阶级革命派大联合，加强无产阶级革命派大团结，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权和巩固无产阶级新政权所面临的和急需解决的重大问题。现在我们正在进行着两条战线的夺权斗争：一方面实行无产阶级革命派大联合，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权；另一方面是夺无产阶级革命派自己头脑中私字的权。前者是运动的大方向；后者则是无产阶级革命派队伍大联合的前提，是夺好权、掌好权的最重要保证。青岛市革命造反委员会决定在全市革命造反组织中进行全面的整风运动，就是为了巩固和扩大无产阶级革命派的大联合，加强无产阶级革命派的大团结，胜利进行向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争和巩固无产阶级的新政权。
    大会在指出整风的目的和提出整风的要求时，号召全市革命造反组织高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，进一步加强阶级斗争观念，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，防止敌人破坏，纯洁革命队伍，加强革命组织的战斗力。大破私字，大立公字，团结大多数，共同对敌。一切无产阶级革命派，要在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下联合起来，团结起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开全面的夺权斗争，把夺过来的一切大权掌好管好。坚决贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，抓革命，促生产，节约闹革命，把毛泽东思想的伟大精神力量，变为伟大的物质力量，打退反革命经济主义的反扑。大会还号召全市的无产阶级革命派战士，要把毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，作为座右铭来学，在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要把自己当作革命的对象，勇于在自己灵魂深处闹革命，勇于夺自己头脑中私字的权，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地。通过整风，把无产阶级革命派的队伍，建设成为一支非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的革命大军。
    大会还要求全市各革命造反组织，在整风学习中要联系本单位的实际情况，做到有的放矢。要切实纠正那种认为当前斗争紧张，工作忙，把整风学习与夺权斗争对立起来的错误思想。一定要做到阶级斗争越是尖锐复杂，工作越是忙的时候，越要加强毛主席著作的学习。
    为了帮助革命左派在整风运动中更好地联系实际，大会还对当前全市无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的形势作了具体的分析，并给各革命造反组织指出了斗争方向：（一）正在夺权的，首先要吸收别人的经验教训，注意联合旗帜鲜明的革命左派组织的大多数，按照毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部，学习、推广黑龙江“三结合”的好经验，实行真正的无产阶级革命派大联合，把走资本主义道路当权派把持的党、政、财、文大权夺过来。（二）发生反夺权的，一定要用阶级分析的观点，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，团结真正的革命力量，孤立、打击一小撮反动分子，戳穿他们的阴谋，并把他们批臭斗倒。（三）有些单位出现了走资本主义道路当权派和保守派假夺权的情况。因此，对夺权首先要用阶级分析的观点，看一看是哪些人夺了权。如果是保守派假夺权，就要坚决反对。要纠正那种凡是夺权就是大方向正确的形而上学的错误看法。一定要组织本单位的革命左派力量，争取团结大多数中间力量，孤立一小撮反动分子，把权夺过来。（四）处于巩固无产阶级新政权阶段的，要很好地总结前段夺权斗争的经验教训，正确地对待革命干部和受蒙蔽的群众，推广“三结合”的好经验。要防止夺权后由于地位改变而产生骄傲自满等各种非无产阶级思想倾向。要高度警惕夺权后，堕落到新的资产阶级反动路线的深渊中去。要把夺得的大权管好、掌牢。
    大会表示坚信，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的亲切关怀和支持下，青岛市的无产阶级革命派一定能够通过这次伟大的整风运动，为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。无产阶级革命派的队伍一定会更加兴旺起来，一定会更加纯洁、更加巩固、更加壮大，形成一支浩浩荡荡势不可挡的文化革命大军。这支大军将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步团结起来，彻底砸烂旧世界，建设起一个闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的红彤彤的新青岛。
