Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat are a precious asset of our Party. In the long course of revolutionary struggle, they have been the backbone; in the present struggle of the revolutionary masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they should also become the backbone. At present, some people ignore the role of these revolutionary cadres in the current struggle to seize power. When revolutionary cadres stand up and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, launch a struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, some people label them as "political opportunists" and "engaging in factional struggles." This is utterly absurd! We say that revolutionary cadres, who, at this critical moment of struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, bravely step forward and lead the masses, and plan and devise for the masses, have clearly shown that they stand on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and are united with the revolutionary masses in common struggle. We must fully trust such revolutionary cadres and fight shoulder to shoulder with them.

We must see that revolutionary cadres, after long revolutionary tests, have rich experience in struggle, are politically more mature, and have stronger organizational ability. This is very beneficial for participating in the seizure of power and the exercise of power. Chairman Mao said: "If our Party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." We must not exclude them, and still less overthrow them!

    革命的领导干部是党的宝贵财富
    张黎
    无产阶级的革命领导干部，是我们党的宝贵财富。在长期的革命斗争中，他们是骨干力量；在今天无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争中，也应该成为骨干力量。现在，有些人忽视这些革命领导干部在当前这场夺权斗争中的作用。当革命领导干部站了出来，同广大革命群众一起向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开斗争的时候，有些人却把他说成是“政治投机”，“搞宗派斗争”。这真是荒唐透顶！我们说，革命领导干部，能够在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的严峻时刻，毅然挺身而出，勇敢地领导群众，为群众出谋划策，这正好说明他们是公开表明站在无产阶级革命派一边，和革命群众相结合，共同战斗的革命态度。对于这样的革命领导干部，我们一定要充分信任他们，与他们并肩战斗。
    我们必须看到，革命的领导干部，经过长期的革命考验，有着比较丰富的斗争经验，在政治上比较成熟，有着比较强的组织能力，对于参加夺权和掌权，都是十分有利的。毛主席说：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”我们决不可排斥他们，更不能打倒他们！
