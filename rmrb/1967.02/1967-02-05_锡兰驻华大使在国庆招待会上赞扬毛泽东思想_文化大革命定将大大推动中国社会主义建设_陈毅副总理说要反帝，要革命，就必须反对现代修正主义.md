Sri Lankan Ambassador to China, Gunawardena, today at the reception celebrating the 19th anniversary of Sri Lankan independence said, "The Chinese people, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong's theories and brilliant thoughts, have achieved splendid and outstanding successes in all fields, leaving all imperialist aggressors at a loss and inspiring all peoples striving for liberation and freedom. We once again raise our hands to pay tribute to the great Chinese people and their respected leaders."

The ambassador said, "We are watching with great interest the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This great revolution will undoubtedly not only greatly promote the development of socialist construction in China but also greatly promote the development of socialist construction in the entire socialist world."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and revolutionary rebel representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other units attended the reception.

Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association, Senanayake, and envoys from various countries in China also attended the reception.

Ambassador Gunawardena first spoke at the reception, introducing the efforts made by the Sri Lankan people to safeguard national sovereignty and develop the national economy. The ambassador said, "Our efforts have received the most generous and precious support from the great Chinese people."

The ambassador condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, saying, "For the peace of Vietnam, U.S. troops should withdraw. Let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems through their trusted leaders."

The ambassador said, "The peoples of Sri Lanka and China are good friends. In recent years, due to the generous support of the great Chinese people, the bonds of friendship between the peoples of Sri Lanka and China have been further strengthened. We respect each other and treat each other as equals. We sincerely hope that for the common interests of the two peoples, this respect and friendship will continue to grow and be further consolidated."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, sincerely thanked the ambassador for praising our great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in his speech. He said, "The current great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. This movement has pushed our socialist revolution to a new stage. Currently, within the Great Wall and across the rivers south of the Yangtze, a unprecedentedly good situation is unfolding. The proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought are waging an unprecedented struggle for power. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party are facing the prospect of doom. All old systems and orders are crumbling. New revolutionary systems and orders are being established. Our proletarian dictatorship has been greatly consolidated and strengthened. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which has profound and far-reaching significance for opposing and preventing revisionism and has opened a new era for the international communist movement."

Vice Premier Chen Yi condemned the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries for their shameless slander and vicious attacks on our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "We must warn these gentlemen that by doing so, you will only end up hurting yourselves, while not harming a single hair of the Chinese people. An unshakable socialist China will fight more strongly against imperialism led by the United States and its running dogs, support the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world more powerfully, and better fulfill our glorious internationalist duties to contribute to the establishment of a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation."

He said, "Currently, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation has entered a crucial period. Chairman Mao said: 'We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialist threats.' The heroic Vietnamese people are a resilient people who cannot be deceived or intimidated. They have long made up their minds to make great sacrifices and will definitely complete the great cause of national liberation and unification. No matter how the U.S. imperialists try to expand their military adventures and play 'peace talks' tricks, they cannot escape the fate of ultimate failure."

He said, "The Chinese people, like the Vietnamese people, have no illusions about U.S. imperialism. We have long been prepared. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also the best and greatest preparation for war. The seven hundred million Chinese people will definitely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression to the end and will definitely smash any plan by U.S. imperialism to expand its aggression."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "As Chairman Mao has pointed out: 'The current situation in the world is one of the final struggle between the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution.' In this struggle, modern revisionism is completely on the side of the counter-revolutionary forces led by U.S. imperialism, playing a role that imperialism and reactionaries of various countries cannot play. Recently, they have been attacking China's Cultural Revolution, frenziedly anti-China, while fishing in troubled waters and colluding with U.S. imperialism to push the 'peace talks' scam on the Vietnam issue. This fully exposes them as the special forces of U.S. counter-revolution. More and more facts show: to oppose imperialism, to make a revolution, to strive for the liberation of all the peoples of the world, it is necessary to resolutely oppose modern revisionism."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The Chinese government and people will, as always, firmly support all the just struggles of the Sri Lankan people. He expressed his belief that as long as the governments and peoples of China and Sri Lanka make sincere joint efforts, the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries will continue to develop and strengthen."

    锡兰驻华大使在国庆招待会上赞扬毛泽东思想
    文化大革命定将大大推动中国社会主义建设
    陈毅副总理说要反帝，要革命，就必须反对现代修正主义
    新华社四日讯　锡兰驻中国大使古纳瓦德纳今天在庆祝锡兰独立十九周年招待会上说，中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的理论和光辉思想的指引下，各方面取得了辉煌杰出的成就，使所有侵略成性的帝国主义者一筹莫展，给所有正在走向解放的、爱好自由的人民带来了鼓舞和希望。我们再一次举起双手，向伟大的中国人民和他们尊敬的领导人致敬。
    大使说，我们以极大的兴趣注视着当前的无产阶级文化大革命。这场大革命肯定将不仅大大地推动中国社会主义建设的发展，而且将大大地推动整个社会主义世界的社会主义建设的发展。
    国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，外交部等单位的革命造反派代表，出席了今天的招待会。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和各国驻华使节也出席了招待会。
    古纳瓦德纳大使在招待会上首先讲话，介绍了锡兰人民为维护国家主权和发展民族经济所作的努力。大使说，我们的这一努力，得到了伟大的中国人民最慷慨、最珍贵的支持。
    大使谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略，他说，为了越南的和平，美国军队应该撤走。让越南人民通过他们所信任的领导人自己解决自己的问题。
    大使说，锡中两国人民是好朋友。近年来，由于伟大的中国人民的慷慨支援，锡中两国人民友谊的纽带进一步加强了。我们相互尊重，而且彼此平等相待。我们热烈希望，为了两国人民的共同利益，这种尊重和友谊日益增长，进一步巩固。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中衷心感谢大使在讲话中赞扬我们伟大的领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，当前我国轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动是毛主席亲自发动和领导的。这个运动把我国的社会主义革命推向一个新的阶段。目前，长城内外，大江南北，都呈现着一片空前大好的形势。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，正在展开一场史无前例的夺权斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派正面临着覆灭的命运。一切旧制度、旧秩序正在土崩瓦解。革命的新制度、新秩序正在建立，我国的无产阶级政权大大巩固和加强了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，对反修防修具有伟大深远的意义，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。
    陈毅副总理谴责帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对我国无产阶级文化大革命进行无耻的诽谤，恶毒的攻击。他说，我们要正告这些老爷们，你们这样做，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，而损伤不了中国人民的一根毫毛。一个永不变色的社会主义的中国，将更坚强地进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，更有力地支援亚非拉和全世界的革命人民，更好地完成我们光荣的国际主义义务，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，作出自己的贡献。
    他说，目前，越南人民的抗美救国战争进入了一个关键的时期。毛主席说：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”英雄的越南人民是坚强不屈的人民，他们是骗不了、吓不倒的。他们早就下定决心，不怕作出重大牺牲，一定要完成祖国解放和统一的伟大事业。美帝国主义不管怎样企图扩大军事冒险和玩弄“和谈”阴谋，都逃脱不了最后失败的命运。
    他说，中国人民同越南人民一样，对于美帝国主义不抱任何幻想。我们早就作好了准备。我国的无产阶级文化大革命，也正是最大最好的战备。七亿中国人民一定要对越南人民的抗美救国斗争支持到底，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义任何扩大侵略的战争计划。
    陈毅副总理说，正如毛主席所指出：“现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面”。在这场斗争中，现代修正主义完全站在以美帝国主义为首的反革命势力方面，起着帝国主义和各国反动派所不能起的作用。最近，他们一面攻击中国文化大革命，疯狂反华，一面混水摸鱼，在越南问题上加紧勾结美帝搞“和谈”骗局。这充分暴露了他们是美帝反革命的别动队。越来越多的事实表明：要反帝，要革命，要争取全世界人民的解放，就必须坚决反对现代修正主义。
    陈毅副总理说，中国政府和人民将一如既往，坚决支持锡兰人民的一切正义斗争。他表示深信，只要中锡两国政府和人民真诚地共同努力，两国的友好合作关系必将继续发展和加强。
