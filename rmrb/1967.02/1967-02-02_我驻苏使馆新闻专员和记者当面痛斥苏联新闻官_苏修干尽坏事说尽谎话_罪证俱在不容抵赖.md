Chinese Embassy News Official and Reporters Confront Soviet News Official
Soviet Revisionists Commit Evil Deeds and Spread Lies; Evidence is Overwhelming and Indisputable

	NEW DELHI, January 31 -- The news official of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Miao Qun, made an oral statement to the assistant director of the news department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Khazov, at 1:30 PM on January 31, denouncing the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department for spreading lies and slanders against China at a press conference on January 28.

	In his oral statement, Miao Qun sternly pointed out that the press conference held by the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department on January 28 was a farce. The bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe by the Soviet revisionist leadership in front of Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square is an ironclad fact that cannot be denied.

	Miao Qun cited irrefutable facts to refute the various lies spread by the deputy director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department, Pyadyshev, at the press conference, who attempted to distort the truth and cover up the brutal suppression of Chinese students in Europe by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents.

	Khazov was at a loss for words under Miao Qun's questioning and could not defend himself, appearing flustered and embarrassed.

	According to the New China News Agency, three reporters from the People's Daily and the New China News Agency in Moscow lodged the strongest protest with the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department on January 31, denouncing the Soviet authorities for assaulting Chinese reporters, illegally detaining Chinese reporters' telegrams and photographs sent to Beijing, and insulting Chinese reporters, obstructing their normal reporting activities.

	The Chinese reporters pointed out that on January 25, two New China News Agency reporters were attacked and beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents while covering the tribute of 69 Chinese students in Europe to Lenin and Stalin's Mausoleum. New China News Agency reporter Zhang Jinghai was knocked down twice, sustaining four injuries. His left leg was kicked, causing immediate bleeding, and his right rib is still painful. His right leg was kicked in two places, causing swelling. New China News Agency reporter Ding Xiangqi was pushed down the steps by a plainclothes agent and fell to the ground, where another agent struck him in the head from behind. Several plainclothes agents then snatched his camera. Afterwards, Ding Xiangqi vomited for two days due to his head injury.

	On the morning of January 26 at 11:00 AM, New China News Agency reporter Ding Xiangqi sent six photographs to Beijing via the Moscow Central Telegraph Office, but the photographs were detained and have not been sent out to this day.

	On the evening of January 29, People's Daily reporter Xie Wenqing was covering the Chinese Embassy staff welcoming Chinese students from France passing through Moscow at the international airport when Soviet plainclothes agents insulted him, making it difficult for him to conduct his normal reporting activities. Three plainclothes agents stood in front of the reporter, blocking the camera lens. When the reporter raised the camera to take a photo, the agents waved their fur hats in front of the camera. At the same time, three agents behind the reporter caused trouble. Some used their knees to push the reporter from behind, making it difficult for him to stand. Others repeatedly pushed the reporter's head from behind with their fists.

	The Chinese reporters angrily pointed out to the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department that your use of these vicious and shameless methods against Chinese reporters proves that you are extremely weak politically and that you are extremely afraid of the truth and extremely afraid of our reporting your fascist actions to the Chinese people. However, your wishes will not be fulfilled. Chinese reporters armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless in the face of tyranny.

	The assistant director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department, Khazov, and the first secretary, Bikov, representing the Soviet Foreign Ministry's news department, listened to the Chinese reporters' protest but shamelessly denied the facts, immediately facing stern refutation from the Chinese reporters. New China News Agency reporter Zhang Jinghai even showed them the scars on his left leg, leaving them speechless and unable to defend themselves.

    我驻苏使馆新闻专员和记者当面痛斥苏联新闻官
    苏修干尽坏事说尽谎话　罪证俱在不容抵赖
    新华社莫斯科三十一日电　中国驻苏联大使馆新闻专员缪群三十一日下午一时三十分就苏联外交部新闻司在二十八日记者招待会上对我进行的造谣诬蔑向苏联外交部新闻司司长助理哈佐夫提出口头声明。
    缪群在口头声明中严正指出，苏联外交部新闻司在一月二十八日举行的记者招待会是一幕丑剧。苏修领导集团在红场列宁陵墓前血腥镇压中国留欧学生的暴行，是铁的事实，是狡赖不掉的。
    缪群列举确凿事实，严厉驳斥了苏联外交部新闻司副司长皮亚迪谢夫在记者招待会上颠倒黑白，妄图掩盖苏修军警和便衣特务血腥镇压我留欧学生真相的种种谎言。
    哈佐夫在缪群的口头声明的质问下，理屈词穷，无法辩解，狼狈不堪。
    据新华社莫斯科三十一日电　中国《人民日报》、新华社三名驻莫斯科记者三十一日上午就苏修当局殴打中国记者，非法扣押中国记者发往北京的传真照片，以及污辱中国记者、百般妨碍中国记者正常采访活动，向苏联外交部新闻司提出最强烈抗议。
    中国记者指出，一月二十五日，新华社两名记者采访中国六十九名留欧学生向列宁和斯大林墓敬献花圈时，遭到苏联军警和便衣特务围攻毒打，新华社记者张景海两次被打倒在地上，身上有四处受伤。他的左腿被踢伤后，当即流出鲜血，右肋骨，至今还在疼痛，右腿两处被踢肿。新华社记者丁翔起被便衣特务从石阶上猛推，倒在石地上，有一便衣特务从后面猛击头部，一些便衣特务上前抢他的照相机。事后丁翔起同志因头部受伤而呕吐两天。
    一月二十六日上午十一时新华社记者丁翔起把六张照片交给莫斯科中央电报局传往北京，但照片遭到扣押，至今没有传出。
    一月二十九日晚上，《人民日报》记者谢文清在国际机场候机厅采访中国使馆人员欢迎中国留法学生路过莫斯科时，苏联便衣特务，对他进行了人身侮辱，百般刁难，破坏他的正常采访活动。有三个便衣特务并列站在记者前面挡住相机镜头。记者把相机举起拍照时，特务们又手举皮帽在记者相机前摇晃不停。与此同时，还有三名特务在记者背后捣乱。有的用膝头顶撞记者后身，使记者站立不稳。有的用拳头不断顶撞记者后脑。
    中国记者愤怒地向苏联外交部新闻司指出，你们对中国记者采取这些毒辣的、无耻的手段证明你们在政治上是极端虚弱的，证明你们十分害怕真理，十分害怕我们把你们的法西斯行径向中国人民做如实的报道。但是你们的如意算盘是不会得逞的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国记者是不畏强暴的。
    苏联外交部新闻司司长助理哈佐夫和一等秘书比科夫代表苏联外交部新闻司听取了中国记者的抗议后，不顾事实地无耻狡赖，当即遭到中国记者严词驳斥。新华社记者张景海还当面把左腿上的伤痕让他们看，他们理屈词穷，无言以对。
