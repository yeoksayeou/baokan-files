According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana dated February 7, the editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article on February 5 pointing out that Podgorny, one of the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique, recently visited Italy. This visit was to adapt to the requirements of Soviet-American cooperation and further plot the treacherous "peace talks" to betray the interests of the Vietnamese people.

The article states that during his visit to Italy, Podgorny did not utter a single word condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, nor did he mention the Vietnamese people's demand that U.S. imperialist troops withdraw from South Vietnam. Podgorny's preaching about "peace" serves the "peace talks" conspiracy of Washington.

Podgorny visited Italian monopolists and lavishly praised the prosperity and progress of monopoly capital, extolling the economic system of Italian capitalist society.

During his visit, Podgorny also had a "friendly" meeting with Pope Paul VI, who actively serves U.S. imperialist aggression policies. The Soviet revisionist leadership has become increasingly mired in cooperation with international reactionaries. The purpose of this meeting was to further plot the treacherous "peace talks" to betray the interests of the Vietnamese people. They also conspired to concentrate their forces on a common anti-China front.

The current policy basis of the Soviet revisionist leadership is to rely on the global counter-revolutionary strategy of U.S. imperialism, directing their spearhead at socialist China. Podgorny's visit to Italy once again confirms that the Soviet revisionist leaders' policy in Europe is completely in line with the strategic plans of U.S. imperialism.

The article concludes by saying that all the tricks used by the Soviet revisionist leadership to cover up their conspiracies cannot deceive the peoples of various countries. Their traitorous faces are becoming increasingly clear to the people of the world.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责苏修的欧洲政策为美帝战略计划效劳
    世界人民已认清苏修叛徒嘴脸
    据新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》五日发表编辑部文章指出，苏修领导集团头目之一波德戈尔内最近访问意大利，是为了适应苏美合作的要求，去进一步策划出卖越南人民利益的“和谈”阴谋。
    文章说，波德戈尔内在访问意大利期间，没有说过一句谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的话，只字不提越南人民关于美帝国主义侵略军必须撤出越南南方的要求。波德戈尔内关于“和平”的说教，是为华盛顿的“和谈”阴谋服务的。
    波德戈尔内拜访了意大利垄断资本家，极力吹捧垄断资本的繁荣进步，并大肆赞扬意大利资本主义社会的经济制度。
    波德戈尔内在访问期间，还同积极为美帝国主义侵略政策效劳的罗马教皇保罗六世进行“友好”的会见。苏修领导集团，已越来越深地陷入了同国际反动派合作的泥坑。这一会见的目的是为了进一步策划出卖越南人民利益的“和谈”阴谋。他们还共同策划，把他们的力量集中在反华的共同阵线上。
    苏修领导集团现在的政策基础，是依靠美帝反革命的全球战略，把矛头指向社会主义的中国。波德戈尔内对意大利的访问，再次证实了苏修领导人在欧洲的政策是完全符合美帝国主义的战略计划的。
    文章最后说，苏修领导集团企图掩盖他们的阴谋的一切伎俩，是骗不了各国人民的，他们的叛徒嘴脸越来越清楚地暴露在世界人民面前。
