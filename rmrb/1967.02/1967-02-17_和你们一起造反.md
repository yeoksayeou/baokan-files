As a Japanese worker in China, I firmly support the Chinese revolutionary rebels in seizing power from the capitalist-roaders. This new victory is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. It is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The past year has been a turning point for the Japanese revolution. In Japan, a countercurrent has emerged to disrupt Sino-Japanese friendship, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has global significance. This countercurrent is led by a small clique that has banned people from participating in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival; they have done everything possible to sabotage the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Japan; they oppose Mao Zedong Thought and denigrate it.

However, their shameful actions cannot obscure the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought; they cannot disrupt Sino-Japanese friendship. In Japan, the number of visitors to the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition reached over 1.5 million in Kitakyushu and over 2.2 million in Nagoya. The Japanese edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" published by the Foreign Languages Press has been widely sold in Japan, and Japan has also published four editions of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but the demand still cannot be met.

The question is whether to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought or to oppose it? Whether to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution or to oppose it? Whether to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Marxist-Leninist Party—the Communist Party of China—or to be hostile to the Communist Party of China? Whether to promote friendship with the great Chinese people or to disrupt it? Such questions are now the fundamental issues in the struggle in Japan.

I believe that to consider the future of the Japanese revolution, one cannot separate it from the direction of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in China. China is the base of the world revolution.

I want to learn the revolutionary spirit of rebellion from the Chinese comrades. In the future, I will also fight shoulder to shoulder with the comrades and rebel together with you!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the red sun in our hearts, the great Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    和你们一起造反
    日本　高比良光司
    作为一个在中国工作的日本工作人员，我坚决支持中国革命造反派夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的革命行动。
    这一新胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    过去的一年，是日本革命处在转折点的一年。在日本国内，出现了破坏日中友好、反对毛泽东思想、反对具有世界意义的中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的一股逆流。掀起这股逆流的一小撮家伙们，禁止人们参加日中青年友好大联欢；千方百计地破坏在日本举办的中国经济贸易展览会；他们反对毛泽东思想，贬低毛泽东思想。
    但是，他们可耻的行径，决不能遮住伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉；决不能破坏日中友好。在日本，参观中国经济贸易展览会的观众，在北九州达一百五十多万人，在名古屋多达二百二十多万人。外文局出版的《毛主席语录》日文版，在日本大量销售，日本也出版了四种《毛主席语录》，但仍然不能满足需要。
    是高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，还是反对毛泽东思想的伟大红旗？是支持伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，还是反对伟大的无产阶级文化大革命？是要和马克思列宁主义的党——中国共产党并肩作战，还是要敌视中国共产党？是推进与伟大的中国人民的友谊，还是破坏与伟大中国人民的友谊？诸如此类的问题，目前，已成为在日本进行战斗的基本的大问题。
    我认为考虑日本的革命前途，不可能离开中国的社会主义革命、社会主义建设的动向来考虑日本的革命前途。中国是世界革命的基地。
    我要向中国同志们学习革命的造反精神，今后也要和同志们并肩作战，和你们一起造反！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳伟大的毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
