Edition: 4

A Japanese miner's son, Yaguchi, is a seventh-grade student who is only thirteen years old. He loves Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Since he received a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in late October last year, he always carries this precious book with him and studies it whenever he has time. He copies the sentences from the "Quotations" that he understands deeply into his notebook. When he encounters words or phrases he doesn't understand while reading, he looks them up in the dictionary or asks others for help. Mao Zedong Thought is like a golden key that has opened Yaguchi's young mind.

Yaguchi has lived in a mining area of Japanese capitalist society since he was young. He has seen with his own eyes the darkness of capitalist society, the arrogance of capitalists, and the large number of unreasonable phenomena where capitalists ruthlessly oppress and exploit miners. This has planted seeds of dissatisfaction and resistance against the evil capitalist society in his young mind. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" have greatly raised his consciousness and pointed out the direction for his struggle.

He opens the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," points to a passage, and says to a Chinese reporter, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of man's will. Whether the reactionaries like it or not, the wheel of history will roll on. Revolution is inevitable and will without fail triumph.' Yaguchi says: 'I completely understand this passage by Chairman Mao. When I grow up, I will become a revolutionary.'

He also says: "The Red Guards in China, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, care about state affairs, destroy the Four Olds, and act as little generals in the Cultural Revolution. I will take them as my example, care about the great cause of the Japanese revolution, and drive the American devils who are riding on our heads out of Japan."

    矿工儿子宝书不离身  立下雄心壮志闹革命
    一位日本矿工的儿子野口是一个初中一年级学生，他今年才十三岁。他热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想，自从他在去年十月底得到一本《毛主席语录》后，不管什么时候他总把这本宝书带在身边，抓紧时间学习。他把毛主席语录中自己体会较深的句子，一句一句地抄在笔记本上，在阅读中遇有不懂的字句，就查辞典或者向人请教。毛泽东思想就象一把金钥匙，打开了野口的幼小的心灵。
    野口从小就生活在日本的资本主义社会的矿区，亲眼看到资本主义社会的黑暗，看到资本家耀武扬威，残酷地压迫矿工、剥削矿工的大量的不合理现象，在他幼小的心灵中播下了对万恶的资本主义社会的不满和反抗的种子。《毛主席语录》大大地提高了他的觉悟，给他指出了斗争方向。
    他打开《毛主席语录》，边指给中国记者看，边说，毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”野口说：“毛主席的这段话，我完全能够懂得。我长大了，就要做一个革命者。”
    他还说：“中国的红卫兵在毛主席教导下，关心国家大事，破除中国的四旧，当文化大革命的小闯将。我要以他们为榜样，关心日本革命的大事。把骑在我们头上的美国佬赶出日本。”
