More than 170 Chinese students returning home via Moscow on February 2nd, before boarding their train at Yaroslavl Station, presented a bouquet of flowers to the statue of Lenin and loudly recited quotations from Chairman Mao.

On February 1st, Chinese students returning home via Moscow had requested through the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union to lay wreaths at Lenin's Mausoleum and Stalin's Tomb, but this request was unreasonably rejected by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Chinese students, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have an unyielding revolutionary sentiment of deep respect for the great revolutionary leader of the proletariat, Lenin, which cannot be stopped by anyone. Despite the various obstacles placed by the Soviet revisionist authorities, Chinese students still expressed their sincere remembrance to the great Lenin.

Under the tight surveillance of Soviet police, the returning Chinese students formed neat rows in front of Lenin's statue at Yaroslavl Station and presented a bouquet of fresh flowers. They then recited in unison a famous sentence from Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism": "The struggle against imperialism, if not closely linked with the struggle against opportunism, is a mere phrase."

Following this, they continued to recite loudly, "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will surely triumph." They also sang "The Internationale."

At this time, the surrounding area was filled with passersby. Soviet police formed a circle, preventing all pedestrians from passing and completely isolating the Chinese students from the crowd.

After presenting the flowers, the Chinese students marched in unison onto the platform. The entrance to the platform was crowded with people, and the police formed a human wall to keep the crowd away from the platform. The crowd repeatedly waved and nodded in sympathy and friendship. Some people, despite the police obstruction, managed to approach the Chinese students, giving them thumbs up and saying, "Well done." The Chinese students also raised their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high and waved in response.

After placing their luggage, the students continued to sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and loudly recited quotations from Chairman Mao on the platform.

In Moscow, spectators braved the cold to view the exhibition at our embassy, which exposed the Soviet revisionists' bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe.

    敌人越是害怕，我们越要干！
    我留学生在苏联火车站向列宁塑像献花  高声朗读毛主席语录引吭高唱《国际歌》
    据新华社莫斯科二日电　一百七十多名途经莫斯科回国的中国留学生，二日下午乘火车离开莫斯科前，在雅罗斯拉夫车站向列宁塑像敬献了花束，并高声朗读毛主席语录。
    二月一日，途经莫斯科回国的中国留学生，曾通过中国驻苏联大使馆向苏联外交部提出要向列宁陵墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈的要求，但遭到了苏联外交部的无理拒绝。
    以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国留学生对无产阶级的伟大革命导师列宁所怀有的无限崇敬的革命感情，是任何人也阻挡不了的。中国留学生不顾苏修当局的百般阻挠，仍然向伟大的列宁表达了他们的真切怀念。
    在苏修警察的严密包围下，中国回国留学生排成整齐的队形，站在雅罗斯拉夫车站旁的列宁塑像前，向列宁塑像敬献上了一束鲜花。然后，齐声朗读列宁在《帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段》一文中的一句名言：反对帝国主义的斗争如果不同反对机会主义的斗争密切联系起来就是一句骗人的空话。
    接着，他们继续用宏亮的声音朗读了毛主席语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”他们还高唱《国际歌》。
    这时，四周围满了过路行人，苏修警察围起一个圈子，不让所有行人通过，将中国学生完全同过路行人隔离开来。
    中国留学生献花后，以整齐有力的步伐走进月台。月台入口处挤满了人，警察拦成一道人墙把群众拦于月台一旁。群众中不断有人向中国学生招手、点头表示友好同情。有的人不顾警察拦阻设法接近中国学生，他们竖起大拇指说：“好样的”。中国学生也高高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》向他们挥动致意。
    留学生把行李安放好后，在月台上继续高唱毛主席语录歌，并高声朗读毛主席语录。（附图片）
