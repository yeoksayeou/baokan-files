A young man from Basutoland in southern Africa has already asked Chinese friends for the *Quotations from Chairman Mao* five times. He recalled that after he obtained his first red-covered treasure book, he and a friend read it together and discussed the situation in Africa based on Chairman Mao's teachings. As a result, his friend was deeply attracted by Chairman Mao's profound and correct views. After repeatedly requesting, he finally managed to obtain this treasure book. His second, third, and fourth copies of *Quotations from Chairman Mao* were also given away in similar circumstances.

    五次要宝书
    非洲南部巴苏陀兰的一位青年已经五次向中国朋友要了《毛主席语录》。他回顾说，在他喜得第一本红皮宝书之后，他和他的一位朋友一起阅读，并根据毛主席的教导讨论了非洲的形势。结果他的朋友被毛主席的透彻而正确的观点深深地吸引住了，他再三提出请求终于把这本宝书要走了。他的第二本、第三本和第四本《毛主席语录》也在同样情况下不得不割爱让给他的朋友了。
