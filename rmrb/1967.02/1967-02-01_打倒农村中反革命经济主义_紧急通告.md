	Overthrowing Counter-Revolutionary Economism in the Countryside
	Urgent Notice

	Editor's Note: Twenty revolutionary rebel organizations of the proletariat in Zhejiang Province have issued a policy notice addressing some noteworthy issues currently arising in rural areas. This notice reflects the will of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, striking hard at all forms of counter-revolutionary economism. At present, preventing the spread of counter-revolutionary economism is a pressing issue that rural areas across the country must pay attention to. The notice issued by the Zhejiang proletarian revolutionary rebels has universal significance. We urge comrades who are proletarian revolutionary rebels in rural areas to carefully read this notice, take corresponding measures based on the situation in their own regions, and resolutely repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

	Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 31st - The Revolutionary Rebel United Command Headquarters of Zhejiang Province and twenty other revolutionary rebel organizations issued the "Urgent Notice to Overthrow Counter-Revolutionary Economism in the Countryside" on January 20th. The full text is as follows:

	Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy.

	The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our proletarian dictatorship.

	Chairman Mao often teaches us: "If socialism does not occupy the rural areas, capitalism will inevitably occupy them."

	The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is being vigorously carried out in the rural areas of Zhejiang Province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are rising up to join the surging tide of the cultural revolution. They are vigorously criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, criticizing the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, and criticizing counter-revolutionary economism. The situation is excellent!

	This great revolution will thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism in our rural areas, promote the ideological transformation of the broad masses of peasants, further consolidate proletarian dictatorship, consolidate the socialist collective economy, and realize Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people."

	This great revolution is a decisive struggle and fierce battle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside, a highly acute and complex class struggle.

	At present, although the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the countryside have been surrounded by the revolutionary masses, they are not willing to accept their own demise. They collude with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside, stirring up a black wind of counter-revolutionary revisionist economism, attempting to shift the direction of the struggle. They exploit the spontaneous capitalist tendencies among some backward peasants, sabotage the rural collective economy, and promote capitalist restoration.

	In the areas of production and distribution, they are playing tricks and using deceitful methods of economism, which is the main feature of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line in the countryside at present.

	The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, under the guise of "rebellion" and "linking up," deceive some of the masses to leave their agricultural production posts. They deliberately create disputes, incite the masses to fight each other, and even instigate armed struggles; they shout slogans like "oppose over-fulfillment of procurement quotas" or unreasonably demand that the state purchase surplus grain at high prices, inciting the masses to refuse the state's procurement of surplus grain, sabotaging the completion of state procurement tasks, harming state interests, and developing a free market in the countryside; under the pretext of "caring for the masses' livelihood," they privately distribute the public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and collective reserve grain of production brigades and teams; they even use various excuses to borrow large amounts of money from the state and forcibly withdraw funds from banks and credit cooperatives. Recently, at the time of year-end distribution, some places have even put forward the capitalist slogan of "eat it all up and divide it evenly," leaving little or no public accumulation and production funds, attempting to empty the collective economy and sabotage agricultural production, in order to achieve their evil goal of strangling the peasant revolutionary movement that is rapidly developing in the vast rural areas of Zhejiang Province and leading the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to failure.

	We revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants must not allow the enemy's vicious plot to succeed!

	The struggle between the two lines and the two roads in the countryside is at a critical moment as the year-end settlement and distribution are about to begin. To thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism in the countryside, to thoroughly smash all the tricks and deceits of the class enemies, to consolidate the rural collective economy, and to ensure that the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside advances victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we issue the following notice.

	1. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres at all levels must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." On the one hand, they must actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside, break down the private and establish the public, and promote ideological transformation; on the other hand, they must firmly hold their agricultural production posts and strive for victory in both revolution and production.

	2. Strictly follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "comprehensive planning and appropriate arrangement," correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the members, ensure the timely, high-quality, and quantitative completion of state procurement tasks, and strive to complete them in advance and exceed the quota, making contributions to supporting the socialist construction of the state and ensuring market supply.

	3. The year-end settlement and distribution must emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the relevant policies on distribution in the "Sixty Articles," and not allow "eating it all up and dividing it evenly." An appropriate proportion of public accumulation and funds and materials necessary for agricultural production must be left. These funds and materials must not be privately distributed or misappropriated after being left.

	4. To maintain the collective economy and prevent bad elements from using counter-revolutionary economism to undermine the foundations of the socialist collective economy, all public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and collective reserve grain from the establishment of cooperatives to 1966 must be temporarily frozen by production brigades and teams and not included in the year-end distribution. (Personal deposits in banks and credit cooperatives are not frozen)

	5. All organizations and individuals in the countryside who have obtained property during the movement to "smash the four olds" must, except for those that should be returned to their original owners according to the Party's policies, hand over all other property to banks and public security and other relevant departments to become state property and not be privately occupied by any unit, organization, or individual. All levels of Party and government agencies, public security and other relevant departments must, under the supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants, promptly handle these properties. No production team, brigade, or commune may hide or privately distribute these properties, nor may they be used for collective production and basic construction.

	Those who, under the pretext of "smashing the four olds," loot public property, embezzle, steal, forcibly occupy collective houses, damage state property, and oppress the masses must be punished according to law.

	6. Financial and accounting personnel, custodians, bank, and credit cooperative cadres at all levels must firmly hold their posts and adhere to principles. Any financial expenditures that do not comply with the Party's policies and the provisions of this notice must be rejected, regardless of which level of leadership approves them. Agricultural loans for 1967 must be temporarily frozen before the year-end distribution, and after the year-end distribution, they must be strictly issued according to the Party's policies after investigation and research.

	The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses must exercise their spirit of being masters of the house and effectively supervise the financial approvals of Party and government organizations at all levels. Any decisions that harm the interests of the state and the collective must be firmly resisted.

	7. The masses who have been sent down to the countryside in recent years and have participated in agricultural production, as well as the sent-down educated youth, should settle down and participate in agricultural production and the cultural revolution in the countryside. Do not be deceived by the bad elements and blindly flow into the cities, so as not to cause damage to the revolution and production in the countryside.

	8. Cadres at the provincial, municipal, and county levels must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, put politics in command, go to the masses, and work with the masses to make the proletarian cultural revolution better and agricultural production better. No one is allowed to play tricks, shoot dark arrows, use economism to corrupt the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, shift the direction of the struggle, and incite the masses to fight each other. No one is allowed to use the excuse of "linking up" and "rebellion" to lie down and not work, sabotaging the cultural revolution and collective production.

	9. In the countryside, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, labor reform detainees, and those who have completed their sentences but have not been reformed well, reactionary party and league cadres, reactionary sect leaders and professional sect practitioners, enemy and puppet military (above the rank of company commander), political (above the rank of bailiff), police (above the rank of police chief), constabulary, special agents, those who have completed their sentences but have not been reformed well, speculators, and family members of counter-revolutionaries who have been killed, imprisoned, placed under surveillance, or fled abroad and insist on a reactionary stance, are not allowed to go out and link up, change their names, forge history, and infiltrate revolutionary mass organizations. They are not allowed to operate and incite from behind, and even less are they allowed to establish their own organizations. These elements, if they engage in sabotage, must be severely punished according to law.

	10. Public security organs, people's armed forces, and militia organizations at all levels in the countryside must strengthen proletarian dictatorship, protect revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations, support the revolutionary leftists, and strictly prohibit armed struggles. Anyone who violates the above provisions and engages in illegal behavior such as attacking revolutionary mass organizations, beating, and detaining revolutionary masses must be seriously investigated and dealt with. Party, government, military, and public security personnel who fabricate facts and persecute revolutionary masses must be severely punished according to law.

	Order the Party and government organs at the provincial, municipal, and county levels to, upon receiving this notice, immediately formulate specific measures based on the situation in their own regions to ensure the implementation of this notice. Send revolutionary cadres to the grassroots level and among the masses to read this notice and relevant policy regulations in their original form, making them known to every household. The situation of implementing this notice should be reported in a timely manner to the Revolutionary Rebel United Command Headquarters of Zhejiang Province. The Revolutionary Rebel United Command Headquarters of Zhejiang Province, the Revolutionary Rebel United Command Headquarters of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Zhejiang Province, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Workers of Hangzhou City, the Third Command Headquarters of Red Guards in Beijing, the Liaison Station of Hangzhou, the Liaison Station of Harbin Military Engineering Academy, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in the Suburbs of Hangzhou City, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Heavy Industry Workers of Hangzhou City, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Colleges and Universities in Hangzhou City, the Red Guard Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station of Zhejiang University, the Revolutionary Rebel United Command Headquarters of Zhejiang University, the Red Guard Combat Team of Zhejiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art Academy, the Liaison General Station of "Bombarding the Headquarters" in Zhejiang Province, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Provincial Organs in Zhejiang Province, the Revolutionary Rebel Brigade of Zhejiang Daily, the Revolutionary Rebel Brigade of Zhejiang People's Broadcasting Station, the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison General Headquarters of the Literary and Art Circles in Zhejiang Province, the New Literary and Art Combat Brigade of Zhejiang Province, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Hangzhou Daily, the Revolutionary Rebel Command Headquarters of Colleges and Universities in Jinhua, and the "November 3rd" Revolutionary Rebel Team of Jinhua Region.

    打倒农村中反革命经济主义
    紧急通告
    编者按：浙江省无产阶级革命造反派的二十个组织，针对当前农村出现的一些值得注意的问题，发出了一个政策性的通告。这个通告体现了无产阶级革命造反派的意志，狠狠打击形形色色的反革命经济主义。当前，严防反革命经济主义的泛滥，是各地农村急需注意的问题。浙江无产阶级革命造反派发的这个通告，具有普遍意义。请农村无产阶级革命造反派的同志们，认真地读一读这个通告，针对本地区的情况，采取相应的措施，坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    新华社杭州三十一日电　浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部等二十个革命造反团体二十日发出《打倒农村中反革命经济主义的紧急通告》，全文如下：
    农业是国民经济的基础。
    工农联盟是我国无产阶级专政的基础。
    毛主席经常教导我们：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正在浙江省农村中轰轰烈烈展开。广大的贫下中农纷纷起来投入文化革命的滚滚洪流，他们大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造反革命经济主义的反，形势好得很！
    这一场大革命的胜利必将在我国农村彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，促进广大农民的思想革命化，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，巩固社会主义集体经济，实现毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大号召。
    这一场大革命是农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大决战，大搏斗，是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。
    当前，农村中党内走资本主义道路的当权派虽然已陷入革命群众的重重包围之中，但并不甘心于自己的死亡。他们和农村中的地、富、反、坏、右分子互相勾结，刮起了一股反革命修正主义的经济主义的黑风，企图转移斗争的大方向。他们利用一部分落后农民中的自发资本主义倾向，破坏农村集体经济，搞资本主义复辟。
    在生产和分配问题上大搞经济主义的阴谋诡计，是资产阶级反动路线新反扑在当前农村中的主要特点。
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派借“造反”、“串连”之名，蒙蔽一部分群众离开农业生产岗位，他们故意制造纠纷，挑动群众斗群众，甚至挑起武斗；他们叫喊“造超产征购的反”，或者无理要求国家以高价来收购超产粮，煽动群众拒绝国家对超产粮的征购，破坏国家征购任务的完成，损害国家利益，发展农村的自由市场；他们以“关心群众生活”为名，大量私分生产大队和生产队的公积金、公益金和集体储备粮；他们甚至以种种借口向国家大量贷款，并到银行、信用社强行取款。最近，在年终分配到来时，有的地方还提出了“吃光分净”的资本主义口号，少留甚至完全不留公共积累和生产资金，妄图挖空集体经济，并把农业生产搞垮，以达到他们扼杀正在浙江省广大农村迅猛发展的农民革命运动的罪恶目的，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命引向失败。
    我们革命造反派，广大的贫下中农绝对不能让阶级敌人的这个恶毒阴谋得逞！
    年终决算、分配即将开始，当前农村的两条道路、两条路线的斗争进入了一个关键时刻。为了彻底粉碎农村中的反革命经济主义，彻底粉碎阶级敌人玩弄的一切阴谋诡计，巩固农村集体经济，保证农村的无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席所指引的方向胜利前进，我们特发出以下通告。
    一、广大贫下中农和各级革命干部要坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大号召，一方面要积极参加农村无产阶级文化大革命，破“私”立“公”，促进人的思想革命化；一方面要坚守农业生产岗位，争取革命和生产双胜利。
    二、坚决遵循毛主席“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的教导，正确处理国家、集体和社员的三者关系，保证按时、按质、按量地完成国家征购任务，并要力争提前超额完成，为支援国家的社会主义建设，保证市场供应作出贡献。
    三、年终决算和分配一定要突出无产阶级政治，坚持按照六十条中有关分配的政策办事，不准“吃光分净”，必须按适当的比例留下公共积累和农业生产所必需的资金和物资。这些资金和物资在留下后不得擅自私分或挪作它用。
    四、为了维护集体经济，防止坏人利用反革命的经济主义挖社会主义集体经济的墙脚，生产大队、生产队自合作化以来到一九六六年为止的全部公积金、公益金和集体储备粮一律暂时冻结，不得加入年终分配。
  （社员个人在银行、信用社的存款不冻结）
    五、农村中任何组织和个人在社会上破“四旧”中所获得的财物，除按党的政策应归还原主的以外，其它一切均应上交银行及公安等有关部门，归国家所有，而不得为任何单位、任何组织或任何个人私自占有。各级党政机关、公安等有关部门必须在贫下中农的监督下，对这些财物迅速予以处理。任何生产队、生产大队或公社，均不得将这类财物隐瞒私分，也不得用于集体生产和基本建设。
    对于借破“四旧”为名，抢掠民财，贪污盗窃，强占集体房屋，破坏国家财产和欺压群众的坏人，必须依法惩处。
    六、各级财务会计人员，保管人员，银行、信用社干部必须坚守岗位，坚持原则。凡是不符合党的政策和本通告规定的财务开支，不论是哪一级领导批准的，一律拒付。一九六七年的农业贷款在年终分配之前暂时冻结，待年终分配后，经过调查研究，再严格按照党的政策发放。
    广大贫下中农和革命群众要发扬当家作主的精神，对各级党政组织的财务审批实行切实有效的监督。对于损害国家、集体利益的错误决定，必须坚决抵制。
    七、前几年下放农村业已参加农业生产的群众和上山下乡的知识青年，应当安心参加农业生产，参加农村的文化大革命。不要听信坏人的挑动和欺骗，盲目流入城镇，以免使农村的革命和生产受到损失。
    八、省、地（市）、县各级干部要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，要政治挂帅，到群众中去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，把农业生产搞得更好。绝对不准任何人耍阴谋、放暗箭，用经济主义来腐蚀贫下中农和革命群众，转移斗争大方向，挑动群众斗群众。不准借口“串连”、“造反”，躺倒不干，破坏文化大革命和集体生产。
    九、农村中地、富、反、坏、右分子，劳动教养分子和刑满留场（厂）就业人员，反动党团骨干分子，反动道会门的中小道首和职业办道人员，敌伪的军（连长以上）、政（保长以上）、警（警长以上）、宪（宪兵）、特（特务分子），刑满释放、解除劳动教养、但改造得不好的分子，投机倒把分子，和被杀、被关、被管制、外逃的反革命分子的坚持反动立场的家属，一律不准外出串连，不准改换姓名，伪造历史，混入革命群众组织，不许背后操纵煽动，更不准他们自己建立组织。这些分子如有破坏行为，要依法严惩。
    十、农村的各级公安机关，人民武装部门和民兵组织，必须切实加强无产阶级专政，保护革命群众和革命群众组织，支持革命左派，严禁武斗。凡违反以上各条以及犯有袭击革命群众组织，殴打和拘留革命群众的不法行为的，都要严肃查处。党政军机关和公安机关人员如有捏造事实，对革命群众进行陷害和镇压的，要依法严惩。
    责令省、地（市）、县各级党政机关自接到本通告之日起，立即根据本地区的情况，制定具体措施，保证本通告的贯彻执行。并派出革命的工作人员，深入基层，到群众中去，原原本本地宣读本通告及有关的政策规定，做到家喻户晓。贯彻执行本通告的有关情况，各地要及时向浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部汇报。浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部浙江省贫下中农革命造反联合总指挥部杭州市工人革命造反总部首都红卫兵第三司令部杭州联络站哈尔滨军事工程学院杭州联络站杭州市郊贫下中农革命造反总部杭州重工业工人革命造反总部杭州市大中专院校红卫兵革命造反总部浙江大学红色造反联络站杭州大学革命造反联合指挥部浙江工农兵美术大学红卫兵战斗队浙江省“炮打司令部”联络总站浙江省省级机关革命造反总部浙江日报革命造反兵团浙江人民广播电台革命造反兵团浙江省文艺界革命造反联络总部浙江省新文艺战斗兵团杭州日报革命造反总部金华大中院校红卫兵革命造反司令部金华地区“11·3”革命造反团
