The proletarian revolutionary faction of Zhejiang Province's Agricultural Production Materials Company, after seizing power, firmly implements Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production," and does a good job of supplying agricultural production materials without missing the opportunity.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 18th: After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Zhejiang Province's Agricultural Production Materials Company, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implements Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production." With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they vigorously push forward the procurement and supply of agricultural production materials, actively supporting spring farming production.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power from the capitalist-roaders within the party, it was right in the midst of the busy pre-planting season, with extremely heavy tasks. Some comrades felt a sense of difficulty. At this time, they repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's relevant quotations, as well as editorials from the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. Many comrades said: We proletarian revolutionaries fear neither heaven nor earth. We have Chairman Mao backing us. We have the fearless spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and pull the emperor off his horse." We should have the ambition and resolve to hold power well. They said: We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning to swim while swimming." In our work, we must actively and timely study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and do a good job of supplying agricultural production materials.

This year, Zhejiang's spring grain planting area has expanded compared to previous years, and green manure has grown well. Currently, it is the critical moment for applying fertilizer, and various places especially require the supply of some chemical fertilizer. In the past, due to the capitalist-roaders within the party emphasizing the completion of so-called "profit" indicators, even if there was fertilizer in the warehouse, it was not allowed to be supplied, thus affecting production. The proletarian revolutionary faction listens to Chairman Mao the most and cares about agricultural production the most. As long as it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, they will resolutely do it. As long as it is beneficial to production, they will resolutely do it. They break down private interests and establish public interests, and carry out mutual support among various regions. With the support of the proletarian revolutionary faction in the Jin Hua prefecture-level station, 13,500 tons of phosphate fertilizer were transferred from the Jin Hua region to support the key rice-producing areas of the Hang-Jia-Hu region, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou, meeting the need for green manure application. The planning department of the provincial company also abolished the old framework of fertilizer allocation from previous years, advanced the transportation and supply, and ensured the increase of spring grain production.

Gypsum is a very important fertilizer for rice production in many mountainous and semi-mountainous areas in Zhejiang, but it needs to be procured from other provinces, making the transportation task very heavy. The warriors of the proletarian revolutionary faction dare to take on heavy tasks and actively request to complete this task. Recently, they also took Chairman Mao's works with them to go down to the countryside and production teams, living and eating with poor and lower-middle peasants, conducting in-depth investigations, strengthening connections with the grassroots communities, helping them solve difficulties, and doing a good job in the supply of spring farming tools, the allocation of oxen, and improving management in various aspects.

    无产阶级革命派要大力支援春耕生产
    浙江省农业生产资料公司无产阶级革命派夺权后，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，不失时机地做好农业生产资料供应工作
    据新华社杭州十八日电　浙江省农业生产资料公司无产阶级革命派夺权后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，狠抓农业生产资料的采购供应工作，积极支援春耕生产。
    这个公司的无产阶级革命派从党内走资本主义道路当权派手里把权夺过来以后，正处在备耕大忙季节，任务十分繁重，有些同志思想上产生了畏难情绪。这时，他们就反复学习“老三篇”和毛主席的有关语录，以及《人民日报》和《红旗》杂志的社论。许多同志说：我们无产阶级革命派天不怕，地不怕，我们有毛主席撑腰。我们既有
  “舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神，就应该有掌好权的雄心壮志。他们说：我们要牢记毛主席的“在游泳中学会游泳”的教导，在工作中活学活用毛主席著作，主动地、及时地做好农业生产资料的供应工作。
    今年，浙江的春粮种植面积比往年扩大，绿肥生长很好，目前正是需要追肥的关键时刻，各地特别要求供应一部分化肥。过去，由于党内走资本主义道路当权派强调完成所谓“利润”指标，即使仓库有化肥也不许供应，因而影响生产。无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，最关心农业生产，只要符合毛泽东思想的就坚决去做，只要有利于生产的就坚决去干。他们破私立公，在各地区之间开展了相互支援。在金华专区二级站无产阶级革命派的支持下，从金华地区调出了一万三千五百多吨磷肥，支援水稻重点产区的杭嘉湖地区、宁波、绍兴和温州等平原地区，赶上绿肥追肥的需要。省公司搞计划工作的同志，也革掉往年化肥分配上的旧框框，提早调运供应，以保证春粮增产。
    石膏是浙江许多山区半山区水稻生产中很重要的一种肥料，但要到外省采购，运输任务很重。无产阶级革命派的战士们敢于挑重担，主动要求去完成这项任务。最近，他们还带着毛主席著作分头下乡下队，和贫下中农同吃同住，深入调查研究，加强和基层社的联系，帮助他们解决困难，作好春耕农具供应、耕牛调剂和改善经营管理等方面的工作。
