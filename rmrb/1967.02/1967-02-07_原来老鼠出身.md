Title: It Turns Out the Rat is Their Origin

One debt of blood has just been incurred, and another new debt of blood has been added. The new czars of Moscow—the Soviet revisionist leadership—have, in less than ten days, orchestrated two horrifying anti-China bloodshed incidents.

In the February 3 anti-China bloodshed incident, they actually directed over a hundred special agents and thugs, armed with electric saws and wielding axes, to storm our embassy in the Soviet Union. They smashed the news display window, beat up our acting charge d'affaires and diplomatic personnel, committing a rare fascist atrocity in the history of international diplomacy!

All of this happened in the dim light of the evening and night.

In ancient China, there is a children's song about bats:

	“Who doesn’t fly by day,
	But you fly by night.
	It turns out you are a rat,
	And you are still afraid of people.”

Isn’t the Soviet revisionist leadership just like these bats!

They act like thieves, “not flying by day,” but “flying by night.” In the dim light of night, they sneak around, furtively committing their evil deeds.

Because they are afraid of their thieving faces being recorded, they also damaged our reporters’ cameras and seized the flashlights; because they are afraid of the Soviet people witnessing their fascist atrocities, they also blocked the roads leading to the Chinese embassy; because they are afraid of leaving evidence, they repeatedly rushed into our embassy, attempting to destroy the evidence…

All of this is for what purpose? It is because their evil deeds are shameful.

“It turns out you are a rat, and you are still afraid of people.” The mutant of the bourgeoisie—the modern revisionists—are most afraid of the people. Once the broad masses of the Soviet people see through their true face of revisionism and recognize their traitorous faces, these guys will be thoroughly defeated!

To commit shameful deeds and not let the people know is something that cannot succeed. No matter if you imitate the bats, sneakily and furtively commit evil deeds, or tear off your masks and commit crimes in broad daylight, you will still not escape the people’s punishment.

    原来老鼠出身
    时灭修
    一笔血债刚欠下，又添一笔新血债。莫斯科的新沙皇——苏联修正主义领导集团，在短短不到十天的时间里，紧锣密鼓地制造了两次骇人听闻的反华流血事件。
    在二月三日的反华流血事件中，他们竟然指挥一百多名特务暴徒，带着电锯，舞着斧头，闯入我驻苏使馆，捣毁新闻橱窗，毒打我国临时代办和外交人员，干下了世界外交史上罕见的法西斯暴行！
    这一切，都发生在天色黯淡的傍晚和黑夜。
    在我国古代，有一首关于蝙蝠的儿歌——
    “谁不日行，偏你夜飞。原来老鼠出身，到底只是怕人。”
    苏联修正主义领导集团，不就是这样的蝙蝠吗！
    他们作贼心虚，“不日行”，偏“夜飞”，在天色黯淡的夜晚，鬼鬼祟祟，偷偷摸摸地干他们的罪恶勾当。
    因为害怕自己的贼相被记录下来，他们还打坏了我国记者的照相机，抢走了闪光灯；因为害怕苏联人民目睹自己的法西斯暴行，他们还把通往中国大使馆的道路封锁起来；因为害怕留下罪证，他们还三番五次地冲进我大使馆，企图灭迹……。
    凡此种种，为的是什么？就因为他们的罪恶勾当是见不得人的。
    “原来老鼠出身，到底只是怕人。”资产阶级的变种——现代修正主义者，最害怕的就是人民。苏联的广大劳动人民，一旦识破了他们修正主义的真面目，认清了他们叛徒的真嘴脸，这些家伙就要彻底失败了！
    既要干见不得人的勾当，又要不让人民知道，那是绝不能得逞的。不管你们学蝙蝠的模样，鬼鬼祟祟、偷偷摸摸干坏事，还是撕破脸皮，白日行凶，都是难逃人民的惩罚的。
