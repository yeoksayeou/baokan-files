In the Pakistani city of Karachi, the largest city in the country, the exhibition showcasing China's industrial and agricultural achievements concluded on the 20th. The Pakistani people highly praised the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao.

During the week-long exhibition, large crowds of workers, students, teachers, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life flocked to the exhibition venue every day. Many visitors gathered around the exhibition staff, requesting a copy of Chairman Mao's beloved works, a Mao badge, or a portrait of Mao. Some even waited for several hours.

A female teacher brought her students to visit the exhibition. This teacher was greatly inspired by some of Chairman Mao's quotations posted in the exhibition hall. She loved these quotations and copied them down. When she received a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," she was extremely moved. She wrote in the guestbook: "Chairman Mao Zedong's words are the most inspiring."

Many visitors, after viewing the exhibition, highly praised the Mao Zedong Thought that guided the Chinese people to achieve great success. One visitor wrote: "All the successes of the Chinese people should be attributed to the great Mao Zedong Thought." Another visitor wrote: "Mao Zedong Thought has boundless power." Yet another visitor wrote: "This exhibition shows that the Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are not only diligent but also daring and capable."

A female student said: "The exhibition shows that the Mao Zedong Thought that guided the Chinese people to achieve such great success is mighty." A journalist said that the pictures introducing Dazhai Brigade and Daqing Oilfield clearly show that once the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can exert their greatest strength and wisdom to create miracles. An elderly person said that this exhibition, especially the pictures introducing Dazhai Brigade, encouraged all Asian and African countries to take the path of self-reliance in national construction.

Some audience members also highly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

    一些观众还高度赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
