The Congolese (L) patriotic armed forces are firmly holding their guns to fight to the end. The guerrilla forces led by Mulele are strengthening political work to smash the enemy's "sweeping" operations.

According to a report from the New China News Agency, Brussels: The weekly newspaper "Voice of the People," the organ of the Belgian Communist Party, recently published a letter from the editorial board of "Lightning," the organ of the Revolutionary Youth Union of the Congo (L). The letter expresses the determination of the Congolese (L) people to continue the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys to the end.

The letter quotes the following words of Chairman Mao: "'To lift a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese idiom used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries in all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various forms of oppression they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only serve to promote more extensive and more violent revolution."

It points out: "The soldiers, in order to liberate their country from the rule of the American-Belgian oppressors and their lackeys, are fighting with weapons in the forests and plains of the Congo."

The letter points out: "American imperialism is the number one enemy of the Congolese people and also the number one enemy of the people of the world."

The letter points out that American imperialism and the Soviet leadership group are closely colluding with each other.

It says, the Congolese (L) people have long seen through the true nature of the "imperialist allies" of the Soviet revisionists, who attempt to achieve "peaceful coexistence" between the exploiters and the exploited, support the United Nations' intervention in the Congo, and thus kill Lumumba and allow American imperialism to invade our country.

The letter concludes by calling on: "All the people of the world, unite to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys!"

According to a recent report from the weekly newspaper "Voice of the People," the organ of the Belgian Communist Party, the patriotic armed forces of the Congo (L) are continuing their struggle in various places, striking hard blows at the enemy.

In the western Kwilu region, the puppet regime of Mobutu, under the orders of American imperialism, has since the beginning of last year been carrying out brutal "sweeping" operations against the guerrilla forces led by Mulele, and establishing so-called "reception centers" (similar to the "strategic hamlets" established by the Americans in South Vietnam), attempting to "isolate" the local residents from the guerrillas in order to "eliminate" the guerrillas.

The guerrillas, using the vast forests as their base, have launched resolute counterattacks against the fake army's "sweeping" operations; at the same time, they are conducting political education among the people in the "reception centers" established by the enemy, mobilizing them to support the guerrillas. The villagers find ways to supply the guerrillas with food and other items. With the strong support of the local people, the guerrillas have thwarted the puppet regime of Mobutu's "pacification" plan and have launched new attacks against the fake army.

The "Voice of the People" weekly says that especially in the Kancha-Loan region of Kwilu, the guerrillas are now striking everywhere, putting the fake army in a serious predicament.

The patriotic armed forces of the Congo (L) have, since their establishment in 1964, rapidly developed from a few dozen people to tens of thousands, and the armed struggle has spread to four out of six provinces in the country.

    刚果（利）爱国武装紧握枪杆子坚决打到底
    谬勒尔领导的游击队加强政治工作粉碎敌伪“扫荡”
    据新华社讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊最近刊载了刚果（利）革命青年联合会机关刊物《闪电》编辑委员会的一封信。这封信表示，刚果（利）人民决心把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底。
    这封信引用了毛主席的下列语录“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    它指出：“战士们为了把自己的国家从美比压迫者及其走狗的统治下解放出来，手持武器在刚果的森林中和草原上进行战斗。”
    这封信指出：“美帝国主义是刚果人民的头号敌人，也是世界人民的头号敌人。”
    这封信指出，美帝国主义和苏联领导集团紧密勾结在一起。
    它说，刚果（利）人民早就看清了“帝国主义者的真正同盟者苏联机会主义者的本质，他们企图实现剥削者和被剥削者之间的‘和平共处’，支持联合国出兵刚果，从而杀害卢蒙巴和让美国佬帝国主义打进我国。”
    这封信最后呼吁：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其走狗！”
    据比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊最近报道，刚果（利）爱国武装力量在各地继续坚持斗争，狠狠打击敌人。
    在西部的克韦卢地区，蒙博托傀儡政权在美帝国主义的指使下，从去年初开始对由谬勒尔领导的游击队进行残酷的“扫荡”，并建立所谓“收容站”（类似美国在南越建立的所谓“战略村”），企图把当地居民同游击队“隔离”开来，以“消灭”游击队。
    游击队以广大森林为基地，对伪军的“扫荡”进行了坚决的反击；同时他们在敌人建立的“收容站”里，对群众进行政治教育，动员他们支持游击队。村民们设法把粮食等物品供应游击队。在当地人民的大力支持下，游击队挫败了蒙博托傀儡政权的“绥靖”计划，并重新对伪军发动进攻。
    《人民之声》周刊说，特别在克韦卢的坎查—洛昂地区，游击队现在到处出击，使伪军陷入严重的困境。（附图片）
    刚果（利）爱国武装力量从一九六四年建立以来，从几十人迅速发展到几万人，武装斗争已扩及全国六个省中的四个省。图为战斗在丛林中的爱国武装力量。　新华社发
