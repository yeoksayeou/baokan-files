The Soviet revisionist leadership's dispatch of military police and thugs to carry out fascist atrocities against personnel of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and Chinese students in Europe has aroused the indignation of Japanese friends. In recent days, they have held meetings and issued statements, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists' anti-China crimes.

Workers from the Chiyoda District of Tokyo, who are actively engaged in the Japan-China friendship movement, held a meeting on the 8th to denounce the Soviet revisionists' anti-China atrocities. The meeting passed a telegram to Chinese students in Europe and personnel of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, expressing heartfelt support for the Chinese friends' heroic struggle against the Soviet revisionists. The telegram said: The anti-China incidents created by the Soviet revisionist leadership are not only a serious provocation against the Chinese people but also a serious provocation against the Japanese people who oppose U.S. imperialism and hope for friendship with China. We absolutely cannot tolerate such anti-China atrocities.

The telegram said: The Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China atrocities further expose their cowardly nature of fearing Mao Zedong Thought, fearing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and fearing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. The telegram expressed that the workers of the Chiyoda District will further strengthen their unity and fight to smash the evil schemes of the modern revisionists.

The chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Kuroya Shoichiro, said: The Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China actions fully meet the requirements of U.S. imperialism. The deceptive arguments made by Japanese revisionists to whitewash Brezhnev and Kosygin have completely collapsed.

A member of the Tama-Kawagoe Branch of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Akamatsu Yasushi, said that the Soviet revisionist leadership's atrocities are identical to the fascist atrocities committed by the fascist regime in Indonesia, which instigated thugs to destroy the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia.

Akamatsu condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for acting as the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. He said, the counter-revolutionary global strategy of U.S. imperialism is to direct its aggression towards the People's Republic of China. Akamatsu emphasized that a resolute struggle must be waged against the Soviet revisionist leadership.

A member of the Japanese Socialist Party, Rikugetsu Kinji, said that the series of anti-China atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership are all premeditated. This once again exposes their revisionist reactionary nature to the people of the world. Their actions will, as pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao, "lift a rock only to drop it on one's own feet."

A member of the Japanese Socialist Party from Saitama Prefecture, Inoue Tadashi, said that the Soviet revisionist leadership's fascist atrocities fully expose their reactionary nature.

Inoue said, Chairman Mao teaches us, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." The Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, has betrayed the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world and beaten up Chinese friends. All this proves that it has degenerated to the enemy side and become a negative example for the revolutionary peoples of the world. We resolutely stand with the Chinese friends and fight against the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The Japanese Journalists' Union issued a statement on the 9th, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's fascist atrocities. The statement condemned the Japanese Communist Party revisionist leadership for joining forces with the Soviet revisionist leadership to oppose China.

    日本朋友对苏修领导集团的反华暴行无比愤慨
    列宁的叛徒是革命人民的反面教员
    据新华社东京十日电 苏联修正主义领导集团出动军警和暴徒对中国驻苏使馆人员和留欧学生进行的法西斯暴行，激起了日本朋友的无比愤慨。连日来，他们纷纷集会和发表谈话，强烈谴责苏修的反华罪行。
    积极从事日中友好运动的东京千代田区的工人，八日举行集会，声讨苏修的反华暴行。会上通过的给中国留欧学生和中国驻苏使馆人员的电报，对中国朋友同苏修进行的英勇斗争，表示衷心的支持。电报说，苏修领导集团制造的这些反华事件，不仅是对中国人民的严重挑衅，也是对反对美帝国主义和希望同中国友好的日本人民的严重挑衅。我们绝对不能容忍这种反华暴行。
    电报说：苏修领导集团的反华暴行，进一步暴露了他们害怕毛泽东思想、害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命、害怕世界人民革命斗争的丑恶面目。电报表示，千代田区的工人要进一步加强团结，为粉碎现代修正主义者的这种恶劣阴谋而斗争。
    日中友好协会（正统）山口县联合会理事长古谷庄一郎说：苏修领导集团的这一反华行径，完全符合美帝国主义的要求。日本修正主义者为勃列日涅夫、柯西金涂脂抹粉的种种欺骗论调，彻底地破产了。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部田无保谷支部会员赤松康稔说，苏修领导集团的暴行，同印度尼西亚法西斯当局指使暴徒破坏中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的法西斯暴行如出一辙。
    赤松谴责苏修领导集团充当美帝国主义的帮凶。他说，美帝国主义的反革命全球战略就是把侵略锋芒对准中华人民共和国。赤松强调指出，对苏修领导集团必须展开针锋相对的斗争。
    日本社会党党员力月金治说，苏修领导集团的一系列反华暴行，完全是有计划的预谋。这就再一次在全世界人民面前暴露了它们的修正主义的反动面目。它们这样做的结果，必将象伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    埼玉县的日本社会党党员井上忠夫说，苏修领导集团的法西斯暴行，充分暴露了它们的反动本质。
    井上说，毛主席教导我们，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”苏修领导集团同美帝国主义勾结一起，叛卖了世界革命人民的利益，殴打中国朋友。这一切证明它已经堕落到敌人方面，充当了世界革命人民的反面教员。我们坚决同中国朋友站在一起，同苏修领导集团进行斗争。
    日本记者同盟九日发表声明，强烈谴责苏修领导集团的这一法西斯暴行。声明谴责日共修正主义领导集团同苏修领导集团联合起来反华。
