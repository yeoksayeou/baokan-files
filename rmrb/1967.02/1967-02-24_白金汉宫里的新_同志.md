In 1844, during the time when the waves of the bourgeois revolution were striking the feudal courts of Europe, the Russian Tsar Nicholas I visited Britain.

As the "gendarme of Europe," the Russian Empire was no longer as powerful as it was in the early 19th century when the "Holy Alliance" was just established. However, Nicholas I, harboring extreme hatred and fear of revolution, desperately tried to revive the bankrupt counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" to save the feudal system from destruction. It was on this common counter-revolutionary basis that Nicholas I was lavishly entertained by Queen Victoria in the British court.

A hundred and twenty-three years have passed since then. The kings and nobles who once ruled over Europe and the world have long been thrown into the dustbin of history. A new era of world revolution has arrived. The proletariat and the people fighting for liberation around the world have launched an irresistible attack on the capitalist and imperialist system. The reactionary forces of the world, under the leadership of the "world gendarme" the United States, have formed a new counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" to save the capitalist and imperialist system from destruction.

It was at this moment that the head of the Kremlin, Khrushchev, visited Britain and was lavishly entertained by the British Queen in the British court.

Khrushchev's visit to Buckingham Palace surprised many. Agence France-Presse commented: "A leader of a communist government becoming a guest of the British monarch at a banquet is unprecedented."

In fact, birds of a feather flock together. Today's British court is merely an antique decoration of British bourgeois dictatorship, while today's Kremlin is the headquarters of bourgeois dictatorship under the banner of the proletariat. What is there to be surprised about Khrushchev becoming a guest of the British monarch?

In this regard, the British bourgeois newspaper *Daily Mirror* is quite insightful. On February 6, the day Khrushchev arrived in London, this newspaper published an article welcoming him, bluntly referring to Khrushchev as a "comrade" of the British bourgeoisie. The article, titled "Welcome, Comrade Khrushchev, to Britain," wrote with a comforting tone:

"Khrushchev shares our concerns. He lives in the same world as us. He does not want trouble. He wants peace and quiet.... Let us drink to the future. To your future and to ours."

Imperialism and modern revisionism both view the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries as "troubles" that hinder their "dominance of the world." It is in extinguishing the blazing revolutionary fires of the people of the world that the British aristocrats and the Soviet revisionist leaders have become "comrades" in the counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" led by U.S. imperialism. And it is to advance this counter-revolutionary cause that Khrushchev came to Britain.

Khrushchev did not disappoint his "comrades." His zeal in betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people won him even more favor from imperialism. The United Press International quoted a "qualified diplomat" in Britain as saying, "It seems that it (the Soviet Union) is sincerely eager to promote peace talks in Vietnam." The American *Newsweek* reported that Washington, which was "remotely controlling" this Anglo-Soviet talks, "believes that the prospect of peace is better than at any time since the war began."

But strangling the Vietnamese people's anti-American national liberation struggle is only part of the conspiracy of this counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance." On the day after the banquet at Buckingham Palace, February 10, Khrushchev showed his full counter-revolutionary frenzy. In a British television program that had been heavily publicized in advance, he viciously attacked the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Johnson in Washington specially watched this "unprecedented" event on television. This was Khrushchev's public performance to show his loyalty to the counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance."

Khrushchev finally exposed his true colors, revealing that his ultimate purpose of the London trip was to oppose China. The United Press International reporter reported that Khrushchev, in his talks with Wilson, "tried to convey the idea" that Moscow's current stance on the Vietnam issue is part of its long-term policy to isolate China.

Khrushchev's efforts to push forward the U.S. imperialism's "bombing and negotiation" plot, to ally with the U.S. to oppose China, and to kowtow and sell out to U.S. imperialism made the U.S. and British imperialists very satisfied. Therefore, when Khrushchev left on February 13, according to the British *Evening Standard*, a nauseating scene appeared at London's Gatwick Airport:

"Today, when Mr. Khrushchev left Gatwick Airport, the characteristic of the scene was: the atmosphere was extremely friendly, the sun was shining, and there were even a few affectionate calls of 'dear' at the farewell.

"Mr. Brown (British Foreign Secretary) said to Mr. Khrushchev's beautiful daughter, Mrs. Lyudmila Gvishiani, 'See you in May, dear'....

"The scene of seeing off could be described with two words: intimacy....

"Mr. Brown, in praising this genuine send-off, said, 'I hope he doesn't get on the plane, and the plane doesn't take off.'"

Khrushchev's London trip ended. Imperialism is making joyful calculations. The British *Sun* said after Wilson saw Khrushchev off: "They have opened a new path of cooperation to try to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table in the future. 'Once the Vietnam issue is resolved, the work of close relations between Russia and Western Europe can be extended across the Atlantic to America.'"

But these gentlemen are rejoicing too soon. The counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" of the 19th century was only a fleeting phenomenon, swept away by the revolutionary storms of Europe. The counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" of the 20th century, facing a revolutionary storm a thousand times greater than that of the 19th century, will it have a better fate?

"Plum blossoms bloom in the snow, freezing flies to death is nothing strange." Let those flies buzz away. Their days of freezing to death are not far off.

### 白金汉宫里的新“同志”

    白金汉宫里的新“同志”
    郭叶
    一八四四年，正当资产阶级革命的风浪冲击着欧洲的封建朝廷的时候，俄国沙皇尼古拉一世访问了英国。
    作为“欧洲宪兵”的沙皇俄国，这时已经大大不如十九世纪初期“神圣同盟”刚刚缔结的时候那样强大了。但是尼古拉一世怀着对革命的极端仇视和恐惧，竭力企图恢复早已破产了的反革命“神圣同盟”，来挽救封建制度的灭亡。正是在这个反革命的共同基础上，尼古拉一世在英国宫廷里受到了维多利亚女王的盛大款待。
    从那时以来，已经过了一百二十三年。当年在欧洲和全世界称王称霸的这些王公显贵，早都被抛进了历史的垃圾堆。一个世界革命的新时代到来了。全世界的无产阶级和争取解放的人民，向资本主义和帝国主义制度发起了势不可挡的进攻。全世界的反动势力在“世界宪兵”美帝国主义的率领下，又结成新的反革命的“神圣同盟”，企图挽救资本主义和帝国主义制度的灭亡。
    就在这个时候，克里姆林宫的头子柯西金访问了英国，并且在英国宫廷里受到了英国女王的盛大款待。
    柯西金成为白金汉宫的上宾，使一些人大为惊异。法新社评论道：“一位共产党政府首脑成为英国君主设宴招待的客人，这还是第一次。”
    其实，物以类聚，人以群分。今天的英国的宫廷不过是英国资产阶级专政的一个古色古香的点缀，而今天的克里姆林宫则是打着无产阶级招牌的资产阶级专政的总部。柯西金成为英国君主的座上客，这有什么可奇怪的呢？
    在这一点上，英国的资产阶级报纸《每日镜报》是颇有见识的。这家报纸在二月六日柯西金到伦敦那天，就在一篇表示欢迎的文章里直截了当地把柯西金引为英国资产阶级的“同志”。这篇题为《柯西金同志，欢迎你来英国》的文章，以慰勉有加的笔调写道：
    “柯西金同我们一样担忧。他同我们在同一个世界上。他不希望有麻烦。他希望和平和安静。……让我们为未来而干杯。为你们的未来，也为我们的未来。”
    帝国主义和现代修正主义都把各国人民的革命斗争看作是妨碍它们“主宰世界”的“麻烦”。正是在扑灭世界人民的熊熊革命烈火这一点上，英国的权贵和苏修的头目成了以美帝国主义为首的反革命“神圣同盟”里的“同志”。而柯西金正是为了推进这个“神圣同盟”的反革命事业来到英国的。
    柯西金没有辜负他的“同志”们的期望。他在出卖越南人民利益方面的劲头，使他更加取得了帝国主义的欢心。合众国际社引用英国“有资格外交人士”的话说，“看来它（苏联）是真心诚意地急于促进越南和谈”。美国《新闻周刊》则报道说，对这场英苏会谈进行着“遥控”的华盛顿，“相信实现和平的前景比战争开始以来的任何时候都要好”。
    但是，扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争，只是这个反革命“神圣同盟”的阴谋的一部分。就在白金汉宫赐宴以后的第二天，二月十日，柯西金表现了他的十足的反革命疯狂劲。他在事先经过大肆宣传的英国电视节目里，恶毒地攻击中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。约翰逊在华盛顿特地从电视里看了这件“空前的事”。这是柯西金为了效忠于反革命“神圣同盟”而作的一次公开的表演。
    柯西金终于暴露了，反华才是他的伦敦之行的终极目的。合众国际社记者报道说，柯西金在同威尔逊的会谈中“设法传递这样的意思”：莫斯科把它在越南问题上“现在所主张的东西，作为它的孤立中国的长期政策的一部分”。
    柯西金这样卖力地推行美帝国主义的“以炸压和”的阴谋，联美反华，卑躬屈节地向美帝国主义卖身投靠，使美英帝国主义非常满意。因此，当柯西金在二月十三日回国时，据英国《旗帜晚报》报道，在伦敦盖特威克机场出现了令人作呕的一幕：
    “今天在柯西金先生离开盖特威克机场时的情景的特征是：气氛无限亲切，阳光和煦，在告别时甚至还亲昵地叫了一两声‘亲爱的’。
    “布朗先生（英国外交大臣）对柯西金先生的漂亮的女儿柳德米拉·格维夏尼夫人说，‘五月份再见，亲爱的’……
    “可以用亲近两个字来形容送行时的情景……
    “布朗先生在称赞这次地地道道的送行时说，‘我希望他不上飞机，飞机不起飞。’”
    柯西金的伦敦之行结束了。帝国主义在进行狂喜的算计。英国《太阳报》在威尔逊送走柯西金以后说：“他们开辟了一条共同合作的新路线，以便将来设法使交战双方参加谈判。”“越南问题一解决，俄国和西欧紧密关系的工作就可以横过大西洋到美洲去了。”
    但是，这些老爷们高兴得太早了。十九世纪的反革命“神圣同盟”，只不过昙花一现，就被欧洲的革命风暴刮得无影无踪。二十世纪的反革命“神圣同盟”，面对着比十九世纪更大千百万倍的革命风暴，难道还会有什么更好的下场吗？
    “梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。”让那些苍蝇嗡嗡叫去吧。它们冻死的日子不远了。
