The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on February 18 exposing and condemning the imperialists and revisionists' intensified "peace talks" deception, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The editorial said that recent events show that Washington is making new efforts to force the Vietnamese people to accept Johnson's "peace talks." The head of U.S. imperialism sometimes claims, "From now on, we are ready to go to the negotiating table at any time," and sometimes talks about "suspension" of bombing North Vietnam. The imperialists' propaganda machine hypes these tricks of U.S. imperialism as "peaceful intentions," while the Soviet revisionists and the Tito clique also call it a "positive turn." The editorial said that to force the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks," U.S. imperialism is conducting frequent diplomatic activities, with the help of the Wilson government, the Canadian government, the Pope, and others. The traitorous Soviet revisionist clique is also actively supporting U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" deception. The Soviet revisionist leadership regards strengthening Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world as paramount, and for this purpose, it is doing everything it can to save its American partner, who has been defeated and disgraced by the Vietnamese people, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberation.

The editorial said that the facts of U.S. imperialism's intensified expansion of the war of aggression have thoroughly exposed its warlike nature and pierced the hypocrisy of the "peaceful intentions" of the Washington ruling clique. U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, continues to expand the war of aggression and intensify the bombing of North Vietnam, and on the other hand, waves the "olive branch," claiming that "the door to peace in Vietnam is open." But in reality, the door reads "American-dominated peace—submission and slavery."

The editorial pointed out that the Vietnamese people are well aware of the savagery and cunning of the U.S. aggressors. The Vietnamese people have not yielded to the brutal violence and heinous crimes of the U.S. imperialists and will not allow their freedom and independence to be traded. As long as there are occupiers on Vietnamese soil, there will be no freedom, peace, or security for Vietnam.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责美帝苏修玩弄“和谈”骗局
    越南人民决不许把自由独立当成交易品
    苏修集团为了苏美合作妄图扑灭越南人民斗争的火焰
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十八日发表评论，揭露和谴责帝国主义和修正主义加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的火焰。评论说，最近的事件表明，华盛顿正在做出新的努力，企图迫使越南人民接受约翰逊的“和谈”。美帝国主义的头子一会儿声称“从现在起我们准备随时走向谈判桌”，一会儿又搞什么“暂停”轰炸越南北方。帝国主义者的宣传机器把美帝国主义的这些阴谋诡计吹捧为“和平诚意”，而苏修和铁托集团也把它说成是“积极的转折”。评论说，为了强迫越南人民接受“和谈”，美帝国主义正在进行频繁的外交活动，得到威尔逊政府、加拿大政府、罗马教皇等等的大力帮忙。美帝国主义的帮凶苏修叛徒集团也正在积极支持美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局。苏修领导集团把加强苏美合作主宰世界看作高于一切，为此，它千方百计地拯救被越南人民打得落花流水，声名狼藉的美国伙伴，妄图扑灭越南人民解放斗争的火焰。
    评论说，美帝国主义加紧扩大侵略战争的事实彻底地暴露了它好战的本性，戳穿了华盛顿统治集团叫嚷的“和谈诚意”。美帝国主义一方面继续扩大侵略战争，加紧轰炸越南北方，另一方面又挥动“橄榄枝”，声称“越南和平的大门是敞开的”。但是实际上大门上写着“美国统治下的和平——屈服和奴役”。
    评论指出，越南人民十分清楚美国侵略者的野蛮和狡猾。越南人民没有在美帝国主义者的野蛮暴力和滔天罪行面前屈服，不容许把自己的自由和独立当成交易品。只要在越南国土上还有占领者，就绝不会有越南的自由、和平与安全。
