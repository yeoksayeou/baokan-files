We must be adept at identifying cadres. We should not only look at a cadre's actions at a particular time, but also examine the cadre's entire history and all their work. This is the primary method for identifying cadres.

We must conduct a class analysis of cadres.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the key question for the revolution." How to deal with those in power is a major issue that the proletarian revolutionary factions must address in the struggle for power through the "three-in-one combination."

Those in power, in terms of their class nature and political performance, fall into two categories: proletarian leaders and a handful of leaders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Proletarian leaders follow Chairman Mao in revolution at all times; they are good party cadres and a valuable asset to the party. They resolutely fight against the handful of leaders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Some of them, during the Cultural Revolution, once implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes, but under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, they resolutely returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The handful of leaders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists. Some of them are class enemies who have infiltrated the party, while others are degenerate elements who have been pulled out. They have usurped some of the power in the party, government, economy, and culture, attempting to restore capitalism in China.

How to deal with these two distinct types of leaders is a touchstone for distinguishing proletarian revolutionary factions from conservative factions.

We proletarian revolutionary factions must, regardless of their position, seniority, or fame, seize power from the handful of leaders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and resolutely overthrow them. This is the fundamental aspect of the movement and its main direction. At any time, we must not deviate from this main direction.

We proletarian revolutionary factions must firmly support and fully trust revolutionary leaders, unite with them, and fight together. These revolutionary leaders have more experience in struggle, are more politically mature, and have stronger organizational capabilities. If they join the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary factions, they can become the backbone and leadership of the struggle for power, which is very beneficial for the victory of the struggle for power.

However, there are those who do not understand Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They do not trust any cadre, do not distinguish between friends and enemies, do not distinguish between proletarian leaders and leaders taking the capitalist road, and do not spare anyone, overthrowing everyone and uniting with no one. In their view, if a higher-level leader makes a mistake, the lower-level leader must be bad, and if the lower level has problems, the higher level must also have problems. This approach of not conducting a class analysis, not making a comprehensive assessment, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything is extremely harmful. Because it goes against Chairman Mao's teachings on class analysis, hinders the implementation of the "three-in-one combination," and weakens the strength of the proletarian revolutionary factions. This erroneous approach must be opposed.

Some leaders, to varying degrees, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, suppressed revolutionary masses, and caused losses to the Cultural Revolution. For these leaders, we should distinguish between them based on the severity of their mistakes and their attitude towards those mistakes. Generally speaking, those who made mistakes in their line but are not anti-party, anti-socialism, or anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and are not stubborn elements who refuse to change, still belong to the contradictions within the people. We should adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" for them, allowing those who made mistakes to correct them, make amends, and stand up to make revolution again. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Past mistakes must be exposed without mercy. We must use a scientific attitude to analyze and criticize the bad things of the past so that future work can be more cautious and better. This is the meaning of 'punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones.' However, our purpose in exposing mistakes and criticizing shortcomings is, like a doctor treating a disease, completely to save people, not to kill them." Therefore, as long as they are not stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line but are willing to correct their mistakes and stand up to rebel, we should welcome them, help them become good comrades, and achieve the dual purpose of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. Doing so will not lose anything but will only make the leaders who made mistakes sincerely submit, uniting more leaders and masses around Chairman Mao and standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. However, some people take a completely negative attitude towards leaders who have made mistakes. They do not analyze the ideological, social, and historical roots of the mistakes made by cadres but instead place too much emphasis on personal responsibility, believing that anyone who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line is not a good person and should all be pushed to the enemy's side. The result of this approach is that it cannot educate cadres or the masses; instead, it loses the masses and hurts the cadres. This is a "left" in form but right in essence error that must be corrected immediately.

The development of the movement urgently requires the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and correctly dealing with revolutionary cadres is an important aspect of this. We proletarian revolutionary factions must not take this lightly. As long as we strictly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy in dealing with cadre issues, through the movement, we can unite more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses, achieving a broader unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions; we can victoriously seize power from the handful of leaders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Otherwise, it will bring losses to the party and the people's cause, and we must not be careless.

    必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。
    对干部要作阶级分析
    哈尔滨师范学院红色造反团
    毛主席教导我们说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”怎样对待当权派，是无产阶级革命派在“三结合”夺权斗争中，必须解决的一个重大问题。
    当权派，就其阶级本质和其政治表现来说，不外两种：一是无产阶级当权派，一是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。无产阶级当权派，时刻跟着毛主席干革命，是党的好干部，是党的宝贵财富。他们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，进行坚决斗争；其中有的人在文化大革命中曾一度执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，但在伟大领袖毛主席的教导下，坚决回到了毛主席的革命路线一边。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子。其中有的是打入党内来的阶级敌人，有的是被拉出去的蜕化变质分子。他们篡夺了一部分党、政、财、文大权，妄图在中国复辟资本主义。
    这两种截然不同的当权派究竟怎样对待，是检验无产阶级革命派和保守派的试金石。
    我们无产阶级革命派对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不管他地位多高，资格多老，名气多大，一律夺权，坚决打倒。这是运动的根本，是运动的大方向。任何时候，我们都不能离开这个大方向。
    我们无产阶级革命派，对革命的领导干部坚决支持，充分信任，同他们联合起来，共同战斗。这些革命的领导干部斗争经验比较丰富，政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，加入无产阶级革命派队伍，可以成为夺权斗争中的骨干力量和领导力量，这对夺权斗争的胜利是十分有益的。
    但是，也有人不懂得毛主席的干部政策。他们对一切干部都信不过，不分敌我，不分无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路当权派，一切都不饶，一切打倒，都不联合。在他们看来，上一级领导干部犯了错误，下一级领导干部肯定不会好，下级有问题，上级也不会好。这种不作阶级分析，不作全面考察，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切的做法，是极端有害的。因为它违背了毛主席所教导的阶级分析的观点，妨碍了“三结合”的实现，削弱了无产阶级革命派的力量。对这种错误的做法，必须反对。
    有些领导干部，在文化革命运动中不同程度地执行了资产阶级反动路线，压制了革命群众，给文化大革命带来了损失。对这些领导干部，要根据他们所犯错误的程度和对错误的态度区别对待。一般说来，犯了路线错误的同志，只要本人不是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的，不是坚持不改的顽固分子，还是属于人民内部矛盾。对他们应采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，允许犯错误的同志改正错误，将功赎罪，重新起来闹革命。毛主席教导我们说：“对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去的坏东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些。这就是‘惩前毖后’的意思。但是我们揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好象医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死。”因此，只要他们不是坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，而是愿意改正错误，起来造反，我们就要欢迎，帮助他们成为一个好同志，达到“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”这样两个目的。这样做，并不会失去什么，而只能使犯错误的领导干部心悦诚服，使更多的领导干部和群众团结到毛主席的周围，站到毛主席的革命路线上来。但是，有的人对犯有错误的领导干部却采取了全面否定的态度。他们不去分析干部所犯错误的思想根源、社会根源和历史根源，而是过多地追究个人责任，认为只要是执行了资产阶级反动路线的就没有好人，统统推到敌人一边。这样做的结果，既不能教育干部，也不能教育群众，相反却失去了群众，伤害了干部。这是一种形“左”实右的错误，必须迅速纠正。
    运动的发展，迫切需要无产阶级革命派的大联合，而正确对待革命干部，是其中的一个重要方面。我们无产阶级革命派决不可等闲视之。只要我们在对待干部问题上，不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策，经过运动，就能团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，实现更广泛的无产阶级革命派的大联合；就能胜利地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。否则，就会给党和人民的事业带来损失，我们务必不可粗心大意。
