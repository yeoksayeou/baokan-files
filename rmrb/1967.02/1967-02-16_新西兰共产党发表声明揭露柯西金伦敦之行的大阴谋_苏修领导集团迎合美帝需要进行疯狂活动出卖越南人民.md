The New Zealand Communist Party Political Committee member Neuns, representing the New Zealand Communist Party, issued a statement severely condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Kosygin for his visit to Britain, which betrayed the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. The statement was published today in the party's official newspaper, "The People's Voice."

The statement reads: "The visit of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Kosygin, to Britain, is part of a series of conspiracies by the Soviet government to help the United States get out of its predicament in Vietnam.

"Shortly after Wilson visited Moscow with Britain's 'peace plan' (which is essentially an American-designed plan), Kosygin went to Britain. This is certainly not a coincidence. The British 'peace plan' does not mention the withdrawal of American troops at all. Kosygin does not mention this either."

The statement points out that the Soviet leaders, while verbally expressing agreement with the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are actually conducting frantic activities behind the scenes to meet the needs of American imperialism. Kosygin's recent visit is a new example of this.

The statement says: "The limited 'aid' provided by the Soviet Union to North Vietnam is not to resist American imperialism, but because without this 'aid,' the Soviet leaders' role as American accomplices would be exposed. The statement points out that the United States regards Kosygin and his ilk as willing tools to serve them."

The statement condemns the Soviet government for acting as an accomplice to the United States on the Vietnam issue while fabricating a series of lies to incite anti-China sentiment.

The statement concludes by saying, "Despite the desperate efforts of the revisionist clique led by Kosygin to help the United States peddle the 'peace talks' fraud, the Vietnamese people have learned from bitter experience that 'as long as the imperialist troops remain on their soil, there can be no peace, and self-liberation cannot be achieved through negotiations. The right to decide their own future ultimately belongs to the Vietnamese people.'"

    新西兰共产党发表声明揭露柯西金伦敦之行的大阴谋
    苏修领导集团迎合美帝需要  进行疯狂活动出卖越南人民
    新华社惠灵顿十五日电　新西兰共产党政治委员会委员纽恩斯代表新西兰共产党发表声明，严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团头目柯西金到英国进行叛卖越南人民抗美救国斗争事业的活动。新共机关报《人民之声报》今天刊登了这个声明。
    声明写道：“苏联部长会议主席柯西金的访英之行，是苏联政府为了帮助美国摆脱在越南的困境而推行的一系列阴谋的一部分。
      “在威尔逊带着英国的‘和平方案’（实质上是美国策划的方案）访问莫斯科之后不久，柯西金就前往英国，这绝不是偶然的。英国在这项‘和平方案’中根本没提首先撤出美国军队。柯西金也根本不提这一点。”
    声明指出，苏联领导人一面在口头上假惺惺地表示同意越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，一面却在幕后进行疯狂的活动，以满足美帝国主义的需要。柯西金最近的访问就是一个新的例子。
    声明说：“苏联向越南北方提供十分有限的‘援助’，并不是为了对抗美帝国主义，而是因为，如果没有这一点‘援助’，苏联领导人作为美国帮凶的面目就将暴露无遗”。声明指出，美国把柯西金之流看作是心甘情愿替他们效劳的工具。
    声明谴责苏联政府在越南问题上充当美国帮凶的同时，还编造一系列谎言煽动反华。
    声明最后说，尽管柯西金这一伙修正主义者拚命帮助美国推销“和谈”骗局，但是越南人民从惨痛的经验中懂得，“只要帝国主义军队还赖在他们的国土上，就不可能有和平，也不可能通过谈判解放自己。决定自己未来的发言权毕竟属于越南人民。”
