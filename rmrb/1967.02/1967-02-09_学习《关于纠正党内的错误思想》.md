The editorial board of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* comments: Our great leader Chairman Mao wrote "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party" in 1929. This is a brilliant document of epoch-making significance and a great program for building the Party and the army. The principles proposed by Chairman Mao in this brilliant work have extremely important practical significance for the construction of the proletarian revolutionary forces today.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of great unity and seizure of power by the revolutionary masses. As the struggle deepens and the status of the revolutionary rebels changes, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts such as parochialism, factionalism, disintegrationism, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, liberalism, subjectivism, and individualism have begun to sprout in some revolutionary mass organizations and affect their current struggles. If we do not be vigilant and resolutely correct these erroneous thoughts, they will seriously hinder the great unity and seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels, hinder the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and hinder the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from advancing to victory.

Chairman Mao's great work is a powerful ideological weapon for us to overcome all erroneous tendencies, a treasure for us to enhance our revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and a guiding light for our victorious advance. We must study this great work as we study the "Three Articles," using it as a motto. We must, with the spirit of rectification, link it with our own thoughts and practical struggles, study it actively and apply it, and build all our revolutionary rebel forces into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready cultural revolutionary army to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To help revolutionary rebel comrades study this great work, we have compiled this guide for reference during study.

A Powerful Ideological Weapon for Strengthening the Construction of the Proletarian Revolutionary Forces

"On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party" is a part of the resolution drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao for the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army in December 1929. Since this congress was held in Gutian, Shanghang County, Fujian, it is also known as the Gutian Resolution. This resolution is the most important summary of our Party's experience in building the Party and the army since its founding. It is the product of the struggle and victory of proletarian thought, proletarian worldview, and proletarian revolutionary line against bourgeois thought, bourgeois worldview, and bourgeois reactionary line within our ranks. It is a brilliant document of great historical and practical significance.

In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao first comprehensively, correctly, and thoroughly solved the issues of direction and line in the construction of our Party and army. From the very beginning of the army's establishment, it was completely built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, fundamentally distinguishing the proletarian army from the bourgeois army, laying the foundation for political work, and becoming a guiding light for the advance of our Party and army. This resolution is a great program for building the Party and the army, shining forever and evergreen.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. Under the great call of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, a struggle for great unity and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries is sweeping across the country with the force of a mountain torrent and the power of thunder, shaking the world. At this critical moment, "our troops must be well-organized, our steps must be in unison, our soldiers must be elite, and our weapons must be good. If we do not meet these conditions, then the enemy will not be defeated by us." ("Rectifying Party Style")

However, in the revolutionary mass organizations, there still exist some erroneous tendencies that hinder the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. For example, parochialism, factionalism, disintegrationism, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, liberalism, subjectivism, individualism, etc. If these are not resolutely corrected, we will not be able to consistently adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, complete the task of great unity and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. As Chairman Mao pointed out in this brilliant work: "The Fourth Red Army's Communist Party contains various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly corrected, then the great revolutionary struggle entrusted to the Fourth Red Army by China will inevitably not be able to be shouldered."

In this work, Chairman Mao profoundly criticizes and scientifically analyzes the above erroneous tendencies and proposes methods for correction. We revolutionary rebel comrades must link it with our own thoughts and practical struggles, seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work. We must overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and at the same time overthrow the bourgeois thoughts in our own minds. We must enhance our proletarian revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, achieve ideological revolutionization, and achieve and consolidate the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought's principles. We must unite the broad masses, launch a general offensive against the crumbling bourgeois reactionary line, seize back the power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and create a new organizational form of the proletarian dictatorship state apparatus, ensuring that our proletarian state remains forever red.

Overcome Various Non-Proletarian Thoughts and Achieve Great Unity of the Proletarian Revolutionaries

In the current new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must focus on understanding the following issues when studying this great work:

1. Launch a campaign to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, eliminate individualism and factionalism.

Chairman Mao deeply analyzes and criticizes individualism and factionalism in this great work.

Chairman Mao points out: "Only paying attention to the interests of one's own small group and not paying attention to the overall interests, on the surface it is not for the individual, but in fact it contains extremely narrow individualism, which also has a great corrosive and centrifugal effect." The factionalism criticized by Chairman Mao is particularly worthy of caution for all revolutionary rebel organizations today. This factionalism will make people forget the overall revolutionary interests of the revolutionary rebels, causing mutual unwillingness, mutual suspicion, and mutual exclusion among revolutionary organizations. With this factionalism, they will occupy mountains and become kings, each ruling their own territory, each establishing their own sects, each governing themselves, each fighting their own battles, turning a revolutionary rebel organization into an independent kingdom. This factionalism will cause disunity, loose relationships, greatly weaken the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary rebel organizations, and seriously hinder the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. Factionalism is a great enemy of the proletarian revolutionaries and must be thoroughly overthrown.

Factionalism is an enlarged individualism. To overcome factionalism, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely "correct individualism in thought."

Individualism is the core of the bourgeois worldview. It is characterized by putting "self" first, reaching out everywhere, competing for fame, profit, power, position, and making a name for oneself, sacrificing revolutionary principles, not caring about the overall revolution, forgetting the 700 million Chinese people, and forgetting the 3 billion people of the world. If a person puts "self" first, they cannot truly accept Mao Zedong Thought and correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; they often cannot distinguish between friends and enemies, cannot clearly see right and wrong, are easily used by the enemy, and in the fierce and complex class struggle, lose the direction of the struggle and even go astray; they will have short-sighted views, only seeing the immediate personal interests, and not seeing the long-term overall revolutionary interests. "Self" is a harmful insect hidden in our minds, and we must root it out and let it turn to ashes in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

Only by breaking down "self" can we establish "public." This "public" is the public of the proletariat, the public of communism, the public of the great group, not the "public" of the small group. This "public" is characterized by not seeking fame, not seeking profit, not fearing hardship, not fearing death, completely selfless, and wholeheartedly for the revolution, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world with all one's heart. In the current fierce struggle between the two lines, defending and implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the greatest public interest. We revolutionary rebels must thoroughly break down "self" and establish "public," cultivate a proletarian worldview, and only then can we complete the great strategic task of the seizure of power struggle in the new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and firmly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. If we put "self" first, seize power, and want to become officials and lords, we will fall into the trap set by the bourgeois reactionary line and place ourselves in the position of new representatives of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, while seizing the power of the capitalist-roaders, we must also seize the power of "self" in our minds. Only by thoroughly seizing the power of "self" in thought can we ensure the victory of seizing the power of the capitalist-roaders. Otherwise, even if we seize the power of the capitalist-roaders, this power will still degenerate into bourgeois power.

We revolutionary rebels must, in the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, truly become "a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person free from vulgar interests, a person beneficial to the people" (In Memory of Norman Bethune), and a proletarian revolutionary who is always loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

2. Strengthen organizational discipline and oppose non-organizational views and ultra-democracy.

Chairman Mao also deeply analyzes and criticizes non-organizational views and ultra-democracy in this great work. In the current fierce and complex class struggle, revolutionary rebels must always be vigilant and seriously struggle against these erroneous thoughts.

Chairman Mao warns us: "The danger of ultra-democracy lies in damaging and even completely destroying the Party's organization, weakening and even completely destroying the Party's combat effectiveness, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, and thus causing the failure of the revolution." Currently, non-organizational views and ultra-democracy often manifest as creating independence, promoting disintegrationism, not communicating, not being satisfied, unwilling to unify actions, acting as one pleases, doing as one likes; only wanting democracy, not wanting concentration, only wanting freedom, not wanting discipline, only wanting personal comfort, not wanting unified will; not seeking common ground while reserving differences on the basis of a unified direction, but entangling in non-principled and trivial issues. These erroneous tendencies are very harmful to the current great unity and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries.

Those who only want democracy and do not want concentration think that democracy is the goal and do not admit that democracy is a means. They emphasize democracy and freedom to an inappropriate degree, absolutizing them. They think that since we advocate daring to think and act to make a revolution, we should not be constrained by any organizational discipline. This understanding is completely wrong. Democracy and freedom are class-based. For proletarian revolutionary fighters, we must smash counter-revolutionary autocracy and counter-revolutionary discipline, and at the same time consciously maintain the democratic centralism of the proletariat and consciously abide by the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Democracy, sometimes it seems to be the goal, but in fact, it is only a means. Marxism tells us that democracy belongs to the superstructure, belongs to the category of politics. This means that, in the end, it serves the economic base. Freedom is also the same." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") Every comrade must fully understand that our democracy and freedom serve the interests of the proletariat and the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship. Without the fundamental premise of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, pursuing what democracy and freedom will inevitably harm the fundamental interests of the revolution.

Currently, the proletarian revolutionary rebels are rapidly uniting, rallying all revolutionary masses, and launching a struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. When considering and handling all issues, every revolutionary comrade must start from this great direction, see the big picture, consider the overall situation, and follow this great direction. There are different opinions within and between revolutionary organizations. If they are principled disagreements, they should be clarified according to Chairman Mao's teachings, "to clarify right and wrong, not to compromise." If they are non-principled disagreements, they should seek common ground while reserving differences on the basis of a unified direction in the struggle, and not argue endlessly over trivial issues. Only in this way can we consolidate unity, enhance combat effectiveness, and jointly fight against the enemy.

The class enemy is not sleeping. They are desperately looking for every crack in our revolutionary ranks, sowing discord, trying to disrupt the revolutionary ranks, and destroy the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. All thoughts and behaviors that promote disintegrationism, liberalism, ultra-democracy, and non-organizational views that disrupt proletarian revolutionary discipline are exactly what the class enemy needs and what they want to use. We must be vigilant and never fall for their tricks.

3. Strengthen class analysis and investigation, overcome subjectivism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Subjectivism exists deeply in some Party members, which is very unfavorable for analyzing political situations and guiding work. Because the subjective analysis and guidance of political situations and work will inevitably lead to either opportunism or adventurism." Chairman Mao's teachings have extremely important significance for guiding our proletarian revolutionary rebel struggles.

Currently, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are colluding with the ghosts and snakes in society, concocting a counter-revolutionary "unity" to resist the revolutionary great unity. They are making every effort to create illusions and chaos. You rebel, they also "rebel"; you unite, they also "unite"; you seize power, they also "seize power"; you say you are a revolutionary rebel, they also claim to be "revolutionary rebels." True and false, false and true. Some bad guys, taking the opportunity of the great unity and seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries, also raise the banner of "revolutionary rebellion," infiltrate the ranks of the revolutionary rebels, sow discord, create incidents, and attempt to split and disintegrate our ranks, disrupt the great unity of the revolutionary forces, and achieve their goal of seizing the power of the proletariat. In this complex struggle, only by using Chairman Mao's method of class analysis, "using the method of Marxism-Leninism to analyze political situations and estimate class forces, to replace subjective analysis and estimation," and at the same time conducting thorough investigations, can we decide on struggle strategies and work methods, and wash away idealist spirits. Only in this way can we see through the phenomena, understand the essence, dispel the mist, and clarify the direction, not falling for the tricks of the class enemy.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: "Our main method of investigation work is to dissect various social classes. Our ultimate goal is to understand the mutual relationships of various classes, obtain a correct class estimation, and then determine our correct struggle strategy, determine which classes are the main force of the revolutionary struggle, which classes are our allies to be won over, and which classes are to be overthrown. Our goal is completely here." ("Oppose Bookism") We must learn and master Chairman Mao's theory on classes, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society in the struggle, conduct in-depth investigations among the masses, and from various opinions, judge which opinions represent the interests and demands of which classes. Only in this way can we correctly implement Party policies, strictly distinguish between enemy and people's internal contradictions, and unite all forces that can be united, thoroughly overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

Arm the Mind with Mao Zedong Thought, Focus on Worldview Reform, and Accelerate Ideological Revolutionization

Individualism, factionalism, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, subjectivism, and other erroneous thoughts are all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois currents. They are fundamentally opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. These erroneous thoughts have a great corrosive effect on our proletarian revolutionary ranks. If they are not corrected in time, we will not be able to complete the great historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The existence of these erroneous thoughts, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "is due to the fact that the largest part of the Party's organizational foundation is composed of members from peasant and other petty-bourgeois origins; but the Party's leading organs lack a consistent and resolute struggle against these incorrect thoughts, lack correct line education for Party members, which is also an important reason for the existence and development of these incorrect thoughts."

In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao profoundly criticizes the erroneous thought that military excellence is political excellence and clearly points out: "The Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks," "military work is only one of the tools for completing political tasks." Emphasizing proletarian politics and implementing Chairman Mao's line for building the Party and the army is the fundamental principle for building the proletarian revolutionary ranks. Politics is the commander, the soul, the direction, and political work is the lifeline of all work. We must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen the construction of the proletarian revolutionary ranks from a political perspective. Otherwise, we will lose our way and go astray. Some comrades think: "Whether or not to grasp ideological work does not matter, as long as we work hard, it will be fine. Being able to work is a good comrade." Some comrades think: "The struggle tasks are so heavy, and the work is so busy, where is the time to grasp ideological work?" Some comrades carry the burden of being a leftist, cannot face their own shortcomings, and neglect personal ideological reform. Under the guidance of these erroneous thoughts, they do not seriously study Chairman Mao's works, do not pay attention to grasping living thoughts, only want to work hard, and do not want to do painstaking and meticulous ideological work; only talk about being able to fight and charge, not about struggle strategies. This is not conducive to the unity and consolidation of the proletarian revolutionary ranks.

Emphasizing politics is emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the end, is to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "We must let hundreds of millions of people master Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society, let this great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought become a great material force!" We proletarian revolutionaries must, in the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, treat the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party" as mottos, while transforming the objective world, transform our subjective world, both treat ourselves as a force for the revolution and an object of the revolution, dare to make a revolution in the depths of our souls, and let Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupy all ideological positions. We must, with the spirit of rectification, carry out criticism and self-criticism, use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to rectify thoughts, rectify the ranks, focus on worldview reform, accelerate the realization of ideological revolutionization, and build our revolutionary rebel ranks into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready cultural revolutionary army, advance vigorously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》
    《解放军报》编者按：我们伟大的领袖毛主席在一九二九年写的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，是一部具有划时代意义的光辉文献，是我们建党建军的伟大纲领。毛主席在这部光辉著作中所提出的原则，对于今天无产阶级革命队伍的建设，具有非常重大的现实意义。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的新阶段。随着斗争的深入发展和革命造反派地位的改变，本位主义、小团体主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、自由主义、主观主义、个人主义等资产阶级和小资产阶级思想，在一些革命群众组织中开始滋长，并影响到他们当前的斗争。对于这些错误思想，如不及时警惕起来，坚决加以纠正，将会严重妨碍革命造反派的大联合、大夺权，妨碍毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深入贯彻，妨碍无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。
    毛主席这部伟大著作，是我们战胜一切错误倾向的强大思想武器，是我们提高革命性、科学性和组织纪律性的法宝，是照耀我们胜利前进的指路明灯。我们一定要象学习“老三篇”一样，把这部伟大著作当作座右铭来学。我们一定要以整风的精神，联系自己的思想，联系斗争实践，活学活用，把我们所有革命造反派的队伍，建设成一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的文化革命大军，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底的胜利。
    为了帮助革命造反派的同志们学好这部伟大著作，我们编写了这个辅导材料，供学习时参考。
    加强无产阶级革命队伍建设的强大思想武器
    《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，是我们的伟大领袖毛主席在一九二九年十二月，为红军第四军第九次党的代表大会起草的决议的一部分。因为这次代表大会是在福建上杭县古田镇召开的，所以又叫古田会议决议。这个决议，是我们党成立以后在建党建军方面经验的最重要的总结，是我们队伍里无产阶级思想、无产阶级世界观、无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级思想、资产阶级世界观、资产阶级反动路线进行斗争并取得胜利的产物，是一篇具有伟大历史意义和现实意义的光辉文献。
    毛主席在这篇光辉的著作中，第一次最全面、最正确、最彻底地解决了我党我军建设的方向问题、路线问题，使我军在建军之初，就完全建立在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础上，从根本上划清了无产阶级军队与资产阶级军队的界线，奠定了政治工作的基础，成为照耀我党我军前进的指路明灯。这个决议，是我们建党建军的伟大纲领，是永放光芒，万古长青的。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。在我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的伟大号召下，一场无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的斗争，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，席卷全中国，震撼全世界。在这个关键的时刻，“我们的队伍就要整齐，我们的步调就要一致，兵要精，武器要好。如果不具备这些条件，那末，敌人就不会被我们打倒。”（《整顿党的作风》）
    但是，在革命群众组织中，还存在着一些妨碍无产阶级革命派大联合的错误倾向。例如，本位主义、小团体主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、自由主义、主观主义、个人主义，等等。所有这些，如不坚决纠正，就不能始终不渝地坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就不能胜利完成无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的斗争任务，就不能将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。正如毛主席在这篇光辉的著作中所指出的：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”
    毛主席在这篇著作中，对于上述的种种错误倾向，进行了深刻的批判，作出了科学的分析，提出了纠正的方法。我们革命造反派的同志，一定要联系自己的思想，联系斗争的实践，认真地活学活用毛主席的这篇光辉著作。我们要革党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命，同时又要革自己头脑中的资产阶级思想的命。我们要提高无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，实现思想革命化，实现和巩固无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想的原则基础上的大联合，团结广大群众，向面临全面崩溃的资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击，把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所篡夺的权力，夺回到无产阶级手里，创造出一个崭新的无产阶级专政国家机构的新的组织形式，让我们无产阶级江山永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    克服各种非无产阶级思想，实现无产阶级革命派大联合
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段中，我们学习这部伟大著作，要着重领会以下几个问题：
    一、开展破私立公的斗争，清除个人主义、小团体主义
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，深刻地分析和批判了个人主义、小团体主义等错误思想。
    毛主席指出：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”毛主席所批判的这种小团体主义，当前特别值得一切革命造反组织警惕。这种小团体主义，会使人忘掉革命造反派的全局的革命利益，造成各革命组织间的互不相让，互不支持，相互猜疑，相互排挤。有了这种小团体主义，就占山为王，各霸一方，各立门户，各自为政，你打你的，我打我的，把一个革命造反组织，变成一个独立王国。这种小团体主义，会使团结涣散，关系松懈，大大削弱革命造反派组织的战斗力，严重阻碍无产阶级革命派的大联合。小团体主义是无产阶级革命派的大敌，必须彻底打倒。
    小团体主义是放大了的个人主义。我们要克服小团体主义，就应该按照毛主席的教导，坚决“从思想上纠正个人主义”。
    个人主义是资产阶级世界观的核心。它表现的特点是“私”字当头，到处伸手，争名、争利、争权、争位、争出风头，牺牲革命的原则，不顾革命的整体，忘记了七亿中国人民，忘记了三十亿世界人民。一个人如果是“私”字当头，他就不可能真正接受毛泽东思想，正确执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；他就往往分不清敌我，辨不明是非，容易被敌人利用，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，迷失斗争的大方向，以至走上邪道；他就不敢坚持真理，在严峻考验的关键时刻，退下阵来；他就会目光短浅，只看到眼前的个人的利益，看不到远大的革命的整体利益。“私”字，是潜藏在我们头脑里的一条害人虫，我们必须把它揪出来，让它在毛泽东思想的阳光下化为灰烬。
    只有破“私”，才能立“公”。这个“公”，是无产阶级的公，是共产主义的公，是大团体的公，而不是小团体的“公”。这个“公”表现的特点是不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，毫不利己专门利人，一心为革命，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。在当前两条路线激烈的斗争中，保卫和贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是最大的公。我们革命造反派只有大破“私”字，大立“公”字，树立起无产阶级的世界观，才能在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段中，胜利地完成夺权斗争这一伟大战略任务，坚定地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。如果我们“私”字当头，夺了权，就想自己当官做老爷，那就正好上了资产阶级反动路线所设下的圈套，把自己放到新的资产阶级代表人物的位置上去。因此，我们在夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，还要夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。只有在思想上彻底夺了“私”字的权，才能保证胜利地夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。否则，即使夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权，这个权也还会蜕化为资产阶级的政权。
    我们革命造反派一定要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，真正做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”（《纪念白求恩》），做一个永远忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命派！
    二、加强组织纪律性，反对非组织观点、极端民主化
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，还深刻地分析和批判了非组织观点、极端民主化等错误思想。在当前尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，革命造反派必须时刻注意同这些错误思想作严肃的斗争。
    毛主席告诫我们：“极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”目前，非组织观点、极端民主化，常常表现为闹独立，搞分散主义，互不通气，互不服气；不愿统一行动，随心所欲，爱怎么干就怎么干；只要民主，不要集中，只要自由，不要纪律，只要个人心情舒畅，不要统一意志；不是在大方向一致的基础上求同存异，而是在一些非原则问题、枝节问题上纠缠不清。这些错误倾向，对于当前无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的斗争，是十分有害的。
    只要民主不要集中的同志，认为民主是目的，不承认民主是手段。他们把民主、自由强调到不适当的程度，把它绝对化了。以为既要提倡敢想敢干闹革命，就应该不受任何组织纪律的约束。这种认识是十分错误的。民主、自由都是有阶级性的，对于无产阶级革命战士说来，必须粉碎反革命的专制，反革命的纪律，同时必须自觉地维护无产阶级的民主集中制，自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律。毛主席教导我们：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。马克思主义告诉我们，民主属于上层建筑，属于政治这个范畴。这就是说，归根结蒂，它是为经济基础服务的。自由也是这样。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）我们每个同志必须充分认识，我们的民主、自由，是为无产阶级利益、为巩固无产阶级专政服务的。离开了无产阶级革命、无产阶级专政这个根本前提，去追求什么民主、自由，那就必然要损害革命的根本利益。
    当前，无产阶级革命造反派正在迅速地联合起来，团结一切革命群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争。我们每个革命同志，在考虑和处理一切问题时，必须从这个大方向出发，识大体，顾大局，服从这个大方向。各革命组织内部和相互之间有不同意见，如果是原则性的分歧，应该按照毛主席的教导，“要把是非弄明白，不要调和敷衍”。如果是非原则性的分歧，就应当在斗争大方向一致的前提下求同存异，不要在枝节问题上争论不休。这样才能有利于巩固团结，增强战斗力，共同对敌。
    阶级敌人并没有睡大觉。他们正在拚命寻找我们革命队伍内的每一点缝隙，挑拨离间，企图破坏革命队伍，破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合。一切闹分散主义、自由主义、极端民主化、非组织观点等等破坏无产阶级革命纪律的思想和行为，正是符合阶级敌人的需要，正是他们所要利用的。我们必须提高警惕，千万不要上他们的当。
    三、加强阶级分析和调查研究，克服主观主义
    毛主席教导我们：“主观主义，在某些党员中浓厚地存在，这对分析政治形势和指导工作，都非常不利。因为对于政治形势的主观主义的分析和对于工作的主观主义的指导，其必然的结果，不是机会主义，就是盲动主义。”毛主席的这一教导，对于指导我们无产阶级革命造反派的斗争，有着极为重大的意义。
    目前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，正在同社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，拼凑起反革命的“联合”，来对抗革命的大联合。他们极力制造假象，制造混乱。你造反，他也“造反”；你联合，他也“联合”；你夺权，他也“夺权”；你说你是革命造反派，他也自称是“革命造反派”。真真假假，假假真真。有些坏家伙，趁着无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的机会，也打着“革命造反”旗号，钻进革命造反派的队伍中来，挑拨离间，制造事端，妄图分裂和瓦解我们的阵营，破坏革命派的大联合，以达到他们夺无产阶级之权的目的。在这种复杂的斗争中，只有用毛主席的阶级分析的方法，“用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量，以代替主观主义的分析和估量”，同时进行周密的调查研究，由此来决定斗争策略和工作方法，洗刷唯心精神。这样才能使我们透过现象，看清本质，拨开迷雾，辨明方向，不上阶级敌人的当。
    毛主席经常教导我们：“我们调查工作的主要方法是解剖各种社会阶级，我们的终极目的是要明了各种阶级的相互关系，得到正确的阶级估量，然后定出我们正确的斗争策略，确定那些阶级是革命斗争的主力，那些阶级是我们应当争取的同盟者，那些阶级是要打倒的。我们的目的完全在这里。”（《反对本本主义》）我们一定要在斗争中学习和掌握毛主席关于社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的理论，深入群众，调查研究，从各种各样的意见中，判断哪些意见代表哪些阶级的利益和要求。这样我们才能正确执行党的政策，严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，才能团结一切可以团结的力量，彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑，狠抓世界观的改造，加速思想革命化
    个人主义、小团体主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、主观主义等错误思想，都是资产阶级和小资产阶级的思潮。它同毛泽东思想是根本对立的。这些错误思想对我们无产阶级革命队伍有着极大的腐蚀作用，如果不及时纠正，我们就不能胜利地完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务。这些错误思想的存在，正如毛主席所指出的，“……是由于党的组织基础的最大部分是由农民和其他小资产阶级出身的成份所构成的；但是党的领导机关对于这些不正确的思想缺乏一致的坚决的斗争，缺乏对党员作正确路线的教育，也是使这些不正确思想存在和发展的重要原因”。
    毛主席在这部光辉著作中深刻批判了军事好就是政治好的错误思想，明确指出：“红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”，“军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一”。突出无产阶级政治，贯彻毛主席的建党建军路线，永远是无产阶级革命队伍建设的根本。政治是统帅，是灵魂，是方向，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。我们必须按照毛主席的教导，从政治上加强无产阶级革命队伍的建设。否则，就会迷失方向，走到邪路上去。有的同志认为：“思想工作抓不抓没有什么，只要猛干就行。能干，就是好同志。”还有的同志认为：“斗争任务这么重，工作这么忙，哪有时间去抓思想工作？”有的同志背上了左派的包袱，不能正视自己的缺点，忽视个人的思想改造。在这些错误思想的指导下，他们不认真学习毛主席著作，不重视抓活思想，只想大干，不愿意做艰苦细致的思想工作；只讲能打能冲，不讲斗争策略。这是不利于无产阶级革命队伍的团结和巩固的。
    突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。无产阶级文化大革命，归根结底就是要大立毛泽东思想。林彪同志指出：“我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！”我们无产阶级革命派一定要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》当作座右铭来学，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要把自己当作革命的对象，勇于在自己灵魂深处闹革命，让毛泽东思想牢固地占领一切思想阵地。我们要以整风精神，开展批评与自我批评，用毛泽东思想这个锐利武器，整顿思想，整顿队伍，狠抓世界观的改造，加速实现思想革命化，把我们革命造反派队伍，建设成一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的文化革命大军，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线勇猛前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
