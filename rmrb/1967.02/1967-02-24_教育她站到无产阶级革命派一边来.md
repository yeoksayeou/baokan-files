My wife, Party Aimei, is a worker at the Taiyuan Textile Factory and a member of the Communist Youth League. During the Cultural Revolution, there were two major organizations in their factory: the "Red Guards" and the so-called "Red Guards." She participated in the so-called "Red Guards." At that time, I did not fully understand the situation of these two organizations, so I did not pay much attention to her participation in the so-called "Red Guards."

It was only when the Cultural Revolution entered a new stage of revolutionary factional unity and struggle that I realized that the "Red Guards" in the Taiyuan Textile Factory were the true revolutionary rebels, while the so-called "Red Guards" organization was conservative. It was at this time that our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the left. The Shanxi Provincial Military Region firmly carried out Chairman Mao's great instructions and resolutely, wholeheartedly supported and assisted the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power. We mobilized troops and went deep into the Taiyuan Textile Factory to support and assist the "Red Guards" in their struggle to seize power.

Under these circumstances, the so-called "Red Guards," manipulated by the capitalist roaders in power, expressed dissatisfaction with the army's support for the "Red Guards." My wife, Party Aimei, was still deceived. I thought: This is a serious issue; she must be educated to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction. I told her: "Our troops are supporting your factory's 'Red Guards'; this is a revolutionary action, and the revolutionary direction of the 'Red Guards' is correct. You should immediately stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction and draw a clear line with that so-called 'Red Guards' organization in terms of ideology, action, and organization." However, due to her deep-seated misconceptions, she could not immediately change her mind. I felt that I had to patiently educate her to awaken her. In this struggle for the proletarian revolutionary factions to unite and seize power, every soldier in the Liberation Army should not only firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the proletarian revolutionary faction but also educate their family members to do the same. If my wife could quickly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, it would play a positive role in promoting the division and dissolution of the so-called "Red Guards" organization, which is a tool of the capitalist roaders in power in their factory, and in consolidating the victory of the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power. I reported these thoughts to our unit's party organization and received the party organization's support. Our department's party cell also conducted a serious study and decided to work with me to carry out in-depth and detailed persuasion and education for her.

I called her back from the factory, and our party cell, with the participation of comrades from the department party committee, had a discussion with her. Based on her thoughts, we first explained the situation of the two-line struggle. We clarified that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is to mobilize the masses to overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party and seize their power, while the bourgeois reactionary line is to suppress the masses and protect the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party. Next, we explained that the struggle between the "Red Guards" in the Taiyuan Textile Factory and the so-called "Red Guards" is a reflection of the two-line struggle. The "Red Guards" are implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They "seize the revolution and promote production," seizing the power of a handful of capitalist roaders in the factory and truly exposing the class struggle in the factory. The so-called "Red Guards," however, have long implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the manipulation of the capitalist roaders in power within the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the factory, they stopped production and always directed their arrows at the "Red Guards"; they also colluded with rightist organizations from other units to destroy the "Red Guards" headquarters, using the pretext of exposing the class struggle cover to persecute the revolutionary masses of the "Red Guards."

After presenting facts and reasoning, she began to awaken. However, she had not yet fully recognized the reactionary nature of some of the leaders of the so-called "Red Guards" organization manipulated by the capitalist roaders in the factory. We continued to point out to her that the so-called "Red Guards" organization had been openly fighting but secretly protecting those people in the factory, always keeping them hidden in the basement, and the "Red Guards" could not find them until the time of seizing power, when they were dragged out from the basement of the so-called "Red Guards" headquarters. This fact powerfully educated her, making her realize that the so-called "Red Guards" organization in the textile factory was indeed a product of the bourgeois reactionary line and a tool of the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the provincial and municipal committees and the factory. At this time, we further exposed the evil deeds of a handful of scoundrels in the so-called "Red Guards" headquarters of the textile factory, making her fully recognize the true face of the so-called "Red Guards" organization in the textile factory. She said, "It turns out to be like this. We ordinary masses did not know, and we were indeed deceived."

After the discussion, I further addressed her active thoughts of not daring to boldly admit her mistakes to the revolutionary masses and studied Chairman Mao's teachings with her: "Errors and setbacks have taught us and made us somewhat wiser, so we can do things better. Any political party or individual is bound to make mistakes. We hope to make fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we should correct them as quickly and thoroughly as possible. The quicker and more thorough the correction, the better. As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely flourish." Chairman Mao's teachings made her realize that surrendering to the truth is glorious.

After repeated education, she finally awakened. After returning to the factory, she actively propagated to the deceived masses, mobilizing more than ten people to write a statement together, announcing their withdrawal from the so-called "Red Guards" organization and requesting to join the "Red Guards," expressing their determination to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction and on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    教育她站到无产阶级革命派一边来
    山西军区司令部参谋　康伟忠
    我爱人党爱梅是太原纺织厂工人，共青团员。在文化大革命中，他们厂有“红卫队”和所谓“红卫兵”两个较大的组织，她是参加所谓“红卫兵”的。由于我当时对这两个组织的情况不很了解，所以我对她参加所谓“红卫兵”的事没有认真过问。
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入革命派大联合进行斗争的新阶段，我才弄清了太原纺织厂“红卫队”是真正的革命造反派，那个所谓“红卫兵”的组织，则是保守派。也就在这个时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出了人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召。我们山西省军区部队坚决执行毛主席的伟大指示，毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持和援助无产阶级革命派起来夺权。我们出动了部队，深入太原纺织厂，支持和援助“红卫队”的夺权斗争。
    在这种情况下，受走资本主义道路当权派操纵的所谓“红卫兵”，对解放军支持“红卫队”的行动表示不满，我的爱人党爱梅还受着蒙蔽。我想：这可是个严重问题，得认真教育她站到无产阶级革命派方面来。我对她说：“我们部队支持你们厂‘红卫队’，这是革命的行动，‘红卫队’的革命大方向是正确的，你应该立即站到无产阶级革命派一边来，和那个所谓‘红卫兵’组织从思想上、行动上、组织上划清界限。”但是由于她中毒较深，一时转不过弯。我感到必须耐心教育她觉悟过来。在这场无产阶级革命派大联合进行夺权的斗争中，我们每个解放军指战员，不但自己要坚决地站在毛主席革命路线的一边，站在无产阶级革命派的一边，而且应该教育自己的家属也这样做。如果我爱人能尽快地站到无产阶级革命派一边，对促进他们厂走资本主义道路当权派的御用工具所谓“红卫兵”那个组织的分化瓦解，对无产阶级革命派夺权胜利的巩固，会起一些积极作用。我把这些想法向我们单位的党组织作了汇报，得到了党组织的支持。我们处里的党小组还认真地作了研究，确定和我一起对她进行深入细致的说服教育工作。
    我把她从厂里叫回来，我们党小组在部党委同志的参加下，和她进行了座谈。针对她的思想情况，首先，讲了两条路线斗争的情况。说明以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是放手发动群众，斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，造他们的反，夺他们的权，而资产阶级反动路线，则是压制群众，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。接着，说明太原纺织厂“红卫队”和那个所谓“红卫兵”的斗争，正是两条路线斗争的反映。“红卫队”是执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们“抓革命，促生产”，夺了厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，真正揭开了厂里阶级斗争的盖子。所谓“红卫兵”却长期执行资产阶级反动路线，在山西省委内和厂里走资本主义道路当权派的操纵下，停止生产，始终把矛头指向“红卫队”；还勾结外单位的右派组织捣毁“红卫队”队部，借口揭阶级斗争盖子，整“红卫队”的革命群众。
    经过摆事实、讲道理，她开始有所醒悟。但是对被厂内走资本主义道路当权派所操纵的那个所谓“红卫兵”组织的少数头目的反动面目，还没有完全认清。我们继续给她指出，那个所谓“红卫兵”的组织对厂内走资本主义道路当权派是明斗暗保，他们一直把那些人保护在地下室里，“红卫队”哪儿也找不到，直到夺权的时候，才从所谓“红卫兵”总部的地下室里揪了出来。这一事实有力地教育了她，使她认识到纺织厂的所谓“红卫兵”的组织，确实是资产阶级反动路线的产物，是省、市委内和厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的御用工具。这时，我们又进一步揭发了纺织厂那个所谓“红卫兵”总部一小撮坏蛋的罪恶事实，使她完全认清了纺织厂那个所谓“红卫兵”组织的面貌。她说：“原来是这样，我们一般群众都不知道，我们的确是受蒙骗了。”
    座谈以后，我又针对她不敢大胆向革命群众承认错误的活思想，和她一起学习了毛主席的教导：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”毛主席的教导，使她认识到向真理投降是光荣的。
    经过反复教育，她终于觉悟过来了。她回厂后，积极向受蒙骗的群众宣传，动员了十几个人一起写了声明，宣布退出那个所谓“红卫兵”组织，要求加入“红卫队”，表示要坚决站到无产阶级革命派一边来，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
