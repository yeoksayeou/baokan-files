	“Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,” is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are precisely such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people.

		From the speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    毛主席语录
    “搬起石头打自己的脚”，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。
