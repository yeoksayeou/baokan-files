Lao guerrillas launched a fierce attack on a U.S. imperialist and puppet airfield in Luang Prabang, destroying and damaging eleven enemy aircraft and killing nearly twenty enemy personnel.

	According to a supplement broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on February 4, the guerrillas of Luang Prabang Province in Laos attacked the Luang Prabang airfield on February 2. The airfield is frequently used by the enemy to launch airstrikes and strafing runs on liberated areas and to provide cover for U.S. puppet forces attacking these areas.

	The broadcast said that in the early hours of February 2, the guerrillas of Luang Prabang Province launched a fierce assault on the Luang Prabang airfield. After a brief but valiant battle, they destroyed six T-28 type aircraft and two helicopters, and severely damaged three more. Nearly twenty enemy personnel on duty were killed on the spot.

	According to a supplement broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on February 2, the military and civilian population of southern Laos fought back against enemy "sweeping" operations on January 17, 18, and 20. In these three days of combat, they killed 255 enemy personnel (according to a January 30 report, 178 enemy personnel were killed), wounded many more, and almost completely annihilated an enemy company stationed in the Ban Sone area of Attapu Province. They also captured one 60mm mortar.
