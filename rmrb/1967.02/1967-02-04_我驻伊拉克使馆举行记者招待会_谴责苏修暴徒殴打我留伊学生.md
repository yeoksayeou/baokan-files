Chinese Embassy in Iraq Holds Press Conference Denouncing Soviet Revisionist Thugs' Attack on Chinese Students in Iraq

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 1—Chinese Ambassador to Iraq's cultural and press attaché, First Secretary Zhang Weiping, held a press conference on the afternoon of January 31, strongly condemning the bloody atrocity committed by Soviet personnel in Iraq against Chinese students studying in Iraq and Xinhua News Agency's correspondent in Baghdad.

	Zhang Weiping introduced to the local and foreign journalists, foreign embassy press officials, and representatives of local student organizations attending the press conference the true facts of the bloody atrocity committed by Soviet Deputy Ambassador to Iraq, A. S. Novikov, on January 28, leading a gang of more than thirty Soviet revisionist thugs against Chinese students and Xinhua correspondent. He pointed out: "Chinese students going to the Soviet embassy to hand in a protest letter is a completely legitimate action. The Chinese correspondent going to cover the news is within his professional duties. However, they were subjected to deliberate, savage, and bloody beatings. This is another blood debt, another serious incident."

	At the press conference, the Xinhua correspondent in Baghdad, as a victim and eyewitness of the Soviet bloody atrocity, made a statement. He refuted with specific facts the distorted reports by Tass and the Soviet News Agency on January 29 about this savage attack. He pointed out: "Tass and the Soviet News Agency reported that the Soviet embassy thugs' attack on Chinese students and Chinese correspondents was an act of provocation by the Chinese students and correspondents, which is a pure distortion and fabrication."

	The medical examination certificates of the five Chinese students and Xinhua correspondent who were beaten and injured, as well as the smashed cameras and flashlights displayed at the press conference, are ironclad evidence of the bloody atrocity committed by Soviet personnel in the Iraqi embassy.

    我驻伊拉克使馆举行记者招待会
    谴责苏修暴徒殴打我留伊学生
    据新华社巴格达一日电　中国驻伊拉克大使馆负责文化和新闻的一等秘书张维平一月三十一日下午在这里举行记者招待会，最强烈地谴责苏联驻伊拉克使馆人员野蛮殴打在伊拉克学习的中国留学生和新华社驻巴格达记者的血腥暴行。
    张维平向出席记者招待会的当地和外国记者、外国使馆新闻官员和当地学生组织的代表，介绍了苏联驻伊拉克大使馆参赞亚·斯·诺维科夫一月二十八日率领三十多个苏修暴徒对中国留学生和新华社记者犯下的血腥暴行的事实真相。他指出：“中国学生到苏联使馆去递交抗议信完全是正当的行动。中国记者一道前往采访消息完全是他业务范围内的事情。可是，他们却遭到苏修蓄意的野蛮血腥的毒打。这又是一笔血债，又是一个严重事件。”
    在记者招待会上，新华社驻巴格达记者作为苏联血腥暴行的受害者和目击者发表了谈话。他以具体事实有力地驳斥了苏联塔斯社和新闻社一月二十九日关于这次野蛮暴行的歪曲报道。他指出：“塔斯社和新闻社在报道中把苏联大使馆的暴徒对中国留学生和中国记者的暴行说成是中国留学生和中国记者的挑衅，纯系歪曲和捏造。”
    在记者招待会上展出的被殴打受伤的五个中国留学生和新华社记者的医院检查证书以及被砸碎了的照相机和闪光灯，是苏联驻伊拉克大使馆人员所犯下的血腥暴行的铁证。
