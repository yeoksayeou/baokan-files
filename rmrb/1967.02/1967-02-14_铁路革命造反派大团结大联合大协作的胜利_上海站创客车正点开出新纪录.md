In the newly established Shanghai Railway Bureau, the revolutionary rebels have further implemented great unity, great alliance, and great cooperation, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production. They have created a new record in the past five and a half months: from 00:15 on February 7 to 20:18 on February 9, all passenger trains at Shanghai Railway Station departed on time for a continuous 68 hours. This is a victory for the great alliance of the revolutionary rebels in the Shanghai Railway System! This is a victory for the revolutionary rebels in the Shanghai Railway System after seizing power, further uniting with the broad revolutionary masses to fight together! This is a victory for the great cooperation of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers along the route!

Since September last year, due to the sabotage by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the passenger trains departing from Shanghai Railway Station were frequently delayed. Especially during the period of the economic wind, trains were unable to depart, and Shanghai Station was in a state of paralysis. At this critical moment, the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters Railway Joint Command decisively seized power from the capitalist-roaders and immediately began to establish a new revolutionary order. They proposed: the revolutionary rebels must not only seize power for the revolution but also hold power for the class. The revolutionary rebel units of Shanghai Railway Bureau, including Shanghai Station, Dispatching Office, Locomotive Depot, Rolling Stock Depot, Train Depot, and the Dongfanghong Brigade of Tongji University, after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," united more closely, united the broad revolutionary masses, and focused on improving the punctuality of trains. In the month since the revolutionary rebels took power, the punctuality rate of trains has surged, finally reaching the record of 68 consecutive hours of full punctuality. During this period, some trains arrived late at the station, but due to the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers' efforts to seize every second, the trains still departed on time from Shanghai Station.

The on-time departure of trains is a concentrated manifestation of the normal operation of the entire railway transportation system. The extraordinary achievements created by the revolutionary rebels of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have vividly proven that: we revolutionary rebels are not only good at destroying an old world but also good at building a new world. It has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels and greatly dampened the enemy's arrogance.

Currently, the revolutionary rebels of the Shanghai Railway Bureau are striving for even higher punctuality goals.

    铁路革命造反派大团结大联合大协作的胜利
    上海站创客车正点开出新纪录
    据上海《解放日报》报道：在新生的上海铁路局里，革命造反派，进一步实行大团结、大联合，大抓革命，狠促生产，创造了近五个多月来的一项新纪录：从二月七日零点十五分起到九日二十点十八分，已经连续六十八个小时，上海火车站的客车全部准时开出。这是上海铁路系统革命造反派大联合的胜利！这是上海铁路系统革命造反派夺权以后，进一步团结广大革命职工共同战斗的胜利！这是沿途各站革命造反派和革命职工大协作的胜利！
    去年九月份以来，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在搞鬼，从上海火车站开出的客车，晚点的情况十分严重。特别是在刮经济主义妖风的时候，客车一度开不出去，上海车站处于瘫痪状态。在这个关键时刻，上海工人革命造反总司令部铁路联合指挥部果断地向走资本主义道路当权派夺回了一切权力，并且立即着手建立新的革命的秩序。他们提出：革命造反派不仅要为革命夺权，还要为阶级掌权。上海铁路局的上海站、调度所、机务段、车辆段、列车段和同济大学东方红兵团等单位的革命造反派，在学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作以后，更加紧密地联合起来，团结了广大革命职工，狠抓列车的正点率。在革命造反派掌权的一个月来，列车的正点率一跃再跃，终于达到连续六十八小时全部正点的纪录。在这期间，有的列车进站晚点了，但是，由于革命造反派和革命职工争分夺秒，从上海站开出去时，照样能达到正点。
    列车开出的正点，是整个铁路运输处于正常的集中表现。上海铁路局革命造反派创造的这一非凡成绩，雄辩地证明了：我们革命造反派不但善于破坏一个旧世界，还善于建设一个新世界。它大长了我们革命造反派的志气，大灭了敌人的威风。
    目前，上海铁路局的革命造反派正在向更高的正点目标迈进。
