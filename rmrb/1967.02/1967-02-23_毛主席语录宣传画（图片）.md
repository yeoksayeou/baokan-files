Edition: 6

Posters of Chairman Mao's Quotations are a new phenomenon that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, marking a significant innovation in the art world. We enthusiastically acclaim: Posters of Chairman Mao's Quotations are excellent! Excellent! The appearance of Posters of Chairman Mao's Quotations, like songs of Chairman Mao's Quotations, can vividly propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making Chairman Mao's teachings known to every household and sung everywhere, thus becoming more widespread and deeply ingrained in people's hearts. They will promote the nationwide movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to advance further. —Editor

    毛主席语录宣传画
    毛主席语录宣传画是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的又一新生事物，是美术界的一项创举。我们热烈欢呼：毛主席语录宣传画好得很！好得很！毛主席语录宣传画的出现，和毛主席语录歌一样，可以形象地宣传毛泽东思想，使毛主席的教导家喻户晓，到处传颂，更加普及，更加深入人心。它将促进全国活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动向前发展。——编者
