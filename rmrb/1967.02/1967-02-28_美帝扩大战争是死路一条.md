		To create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until annihilation—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the cause of the people. They will not deviate from this logic.

		The U.S. empire's expansion of war is a dead end.

		On February 22, the American aggressors fired long-range artillery from South Vietnam into areas north of the Vietnamese demilitarized zone. This is another extremely serious "escalation" of the U.S. invasion of Vietnam by the Johnson administration, and it is another desperate struggle by the U.S. in the dead-end alley of its aggression against Vietnam.

		In recent days, while the Johnson administration has been shouting about "negotiations" on the Vietnam issue, it has not stopped strengthening its war of aggression. The U.S. air pirates once again brazenly attacked the areas of Hanoi and Haiphong. McNamara openly boasted that he would add "new targets" for bombing North Vietnam. In South Vietnam, according to a U.S. news agency, the U.S. aggressors have also drawn up a plan to "intensify ground operations and expand their scale." The artillery fire in the Vietnamese demilitarized zone is another new signal of the U.S. imperialists' further escalation of the war in Vietnam. The facts show that U.S. imperialism will absolutely not lay down its butcher's knife on its own, and it will absolutely not become a Buddha. People of all countries should not harbor any illusions about it.

		Escalate the war—fail—escalate the war again—fail again. The U.S. aggressors have fallen into this vicious cycle.

		Recently, Johnson has acknowledged that they are "facing pain" on the Vietnam battlefield, while at the same time boasting about strengthening "efforts" and preparing to pay a "huge price." This outlines the ugly struggle of U.S. imperialism.

		Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialism's threats."

		The situation of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam is already on the decline. The Johnson administration's desperate attempts to peddle the "negotiation" fraud have not been successful, and it is now stepping up the "escalation" of the war, engaging in "war for peace." This fully reflects the U.S. imperialists' predicament of being stuck in a dead-end situation in South Vietnam, where they can neither fight nor deceive successfully, and are in a state of "war and peace" dilemma.

		The Chinese people firmly believe that the brave Vietnamese people are not afraid. The U.S. imperialists' criminal acts of expanding the war in Vietnam will only further strengthen the determination of the 31 million Vietnamese people to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. The Vietnamese people will certainly turn their deep hatred into actions against the enemy. The day will surely come when the Vietnamese people drive the U.S. aggressors out of their country, not leaving a single one behind.

    捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。
    美帝扩大战争是死路一条
    本报评论员
    美国侵略强盗在二月二十二日从越南南方用远程大炮轰击越南非军事区以北的地区。这是约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的又一极其严重的战争“升级”，也是它在侵略越南的死胡同中进行的又一次疯狂挣扎。
    这些天来，约翰逊政府在越南问题上大叫“和谈”的同时，一直都没有停止过加强侵略战争的这一手。美国空中强盗再次悍然袭击河内和海防地区。麦克纳马拉公然叫嚷还要增加轰炸越南北方的“新目标”。而在越南南方，据美国通讯社透露，美国侵略者也已经制订了所谓“加强地面行动的猛烈程度和扩大其规模的计划”。越南非军事区的炮声，正是美帝国主义在越南以更大规模扩大战争的又一个新的信号。事实表明，美帝国主义是绝对不会自动放下屠刀，也绝对不会成佛的。各国人民对它决不能抱任何幻想。
    扩大战争——失败——再扩大战争——再失败，美国侵略者已经陷入这一恶性循环的漩涡里。
    最近，约翰逊一方面承认在越南战场上“面临痛苦”，一方面又叫嚷加强“努力”，准备付出“巨大的代价”，这就勾划出了美帝国主义进行疯狂挣扎的丑态。
    毛主席说：“美国帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”
    美帝国主义在越南的处境，已是日薄西山。约翰逊政府拚命兜售“和谈”骗局不能如愿以偿，又加紧战争“升级”，大搞“以战压和”，这正好反映了美帝国主义在南越打又打不下去，骗又骗不成功的战“和”两难、死路一条的困境。
    中国人民坚信，英勇的越南人民是吓不倒的。美帝国主义在越南扩大战火的罪恶行径，只能进一步加强三千一百万越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的决心。越南人民一定会把满腔仇恨凝结在对敌斗争的行动上。越南人民把美国侵略者一个不剩地赶出国土的日子，是一定会到来的。
