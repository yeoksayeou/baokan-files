On the afternoon of February 16, the illegal so-called Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council, orchestrated by the Soviet revisionist leadership, had not yet concluded. At this time, four African nationalist organizations—South West Africa People's Organization, Botswana People's Party, Swaziland Progressive Party, and Basutoland Congress Party—which had bravely fought against the Soviet revisionists at the meeting and announced their withdrawal on the 15th to protest the Soviet revisionists' splitist crimes, were on their way to the airport, leaving Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. Along the way, they repeatedly waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" out of the car windows, filled with pride and a sense of victory.

It was these spirited African freedom fighters who, under the inspiration of the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, fought resolutely against the Soviet revisionists at this illegal meeting and achieved victory. Their struggle once again proved that revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. Chairman Mao's teachings gave them courage and confidence.

At this illegal meeting, the Soviet revisionists used various despicable tactics to forcefully overturn the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Winneba to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. However, the African freedom fighters saw through the tricks of the revisionists and thoroughly exposed them. In their struggle against the Soviet revisionists, they always kept "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their pockets. Whenever they encountered problems, they would find answers in "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The Soviet revisionists and their followers, in order to achieve their nefarious purposes, even tried to mobilize the Cypriot police to intimidate these freedom fighters. Faced with fascist repression, the African freedom fighters gathered together many times, reading aloud Mao's quotations: "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must have courage to fight, dare to struggle, be unafraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

It was Chairman Mao's teachings that gave them great courage and confidence. They even read collectively at night the quotations from Chairman Mao about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers and the essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "People all die, but death has different meanings. The ancient Chinese historian Sima Qian said, 'To die is a matter of necessity; but there are heavy as Mount Tai and light as a feather.' To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists and the people's oppressors is lighter than a feather." They expressed that they were prepared for arrest, beatings, and even suppression, but they would never surrender to the Soviet revisionists. They sternly denounced the Soviet revisionists' betrayal.

At the meeting, these African freedom fighters, despite the arbitrary obstruction of the illegal meeting's organizers, sternly condemned the serious crimes of the Soviet modern revisionists in splitting activities and betraying the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian-African peoples. The representative of the South West Africa People's Organization pointed out: "The entire policy, purpose, and motive of modern revisionism are contrary to the wishes and expectations of the revolutionary masses of the world. Therefore, we have reached the stage where we must draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution." The representative of the Swaziland Progressive Party, in response to the Soviet revisionists' betrayal, pointed out: "Certain big powers attempt to make the Asian-African solidarity organization deviate from the anti-imperialist path, stripping it of its revolutionary nature, which is a serious betrayal of the interests of the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." The representatives of the four African nationalist organizations that withdrew from this illegal meeting saw through the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionists and, in a joint statement, called on the Soviet people to rise up and overthrow the reactionary rule of Soviet revisionism, liberating themselves from the rule of revisionism.

The African freedom fighters firmly upheld the resolution of the Winneba Conference to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year and highly praised the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The representative of the Botswana People's Party said in his speech: "We applaud and support the Chinese people's just struggle against imperialism and revisionism led by the United States. We applaud the vigorous development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao." The representative of the Swaziland Progressive Party said in his speech, "We will praise Chairman Mao and the 700 million Chinese people at every international conference because 'today, China is a bastion of the anti-imperialist struggle.' They cheered, 'We are honored that the 700 million Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong are willing to be the hosts of the Fifth Conference. We want to go to Beijing! We want to see Chairman Mao!'"

The most moving scene occurred on the eve of their departure from Nicosia. After the representatives of the four African nationalist organizations fully exposed the Soviet revisionists' splitist activities and announced their withdrawal from the meeting at the so-called "Organizing Committee" meeting, they returned to the hotel at four in the morning. They gathered in a room, joyfully playing Chinese records "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helm." Many of them sang along in Chinese, "The East is red, the sun is rising, China has given birth to Mao Zedong. He devotes himself to the people's happiness... He is the people's great savior..." They also sang, "The boat sails on the sea depending on the helm, all things grow relying on the sun... Revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought..." These Chinese revolutionary songs obviously made the revolutionary African freedom fighters even more spirited, and their voices became louder and louder. Finally, they read aloud Mao's quotations once again: "The people of the world must have courage to fight, dare to struggle, be unafraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

These African freedom fighters were full of fighting spirit as they left Nicosia. They said, "We have won! We have exposed the Soviet revisionists' conspiracy!" They joyfully said, "We will go to Beijing to attend the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. We long to see Chairman Mao!" A Zimbabwean freedom fighter said, "Today, Chairman Mao is the great commander of the world revolutionary people."

Our red sun, Chairman Mao! It is your great thoughts that guide the African freedom fighters in their brave struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all the demons and monsters in the world. Your invincible thoughts will forever lead the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, and all the revolutionary peoples of the world, from one victory to another new victory!

    伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞非洲自由战士英勇斗争
    ——非洲自由战士在尼科西亚会议上痛斥苏修分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的新罪行
    二月十六日下午，苏联修正主义领导集团导演的非法的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议还没有收场。这时，曾在会上同苏修进行过英勇斗争，并于十五日为抗议苏修的分裂罪行宣布退出会议的四个非洲民族主义组织——西南非洲民族联盟、贝专纳人民党、斯威士兰进步党和巴苏陀兰大会党——的代表团，正乘车前往机场，离开塞浦路斯首都尼科西亚。一路上，他们从汽车窗口长时间地挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，充满了自豪和胜利的感情。
    正是这些精神焕发的非洲自由战士们，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，在这个非法会议上同苏修进行了坚决的斗争，取得了胜利。他们的斗争再一次证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民是不可战胜的。毛主席的教导给了他们勇气和信心
    在这次非法的会议上，苏修采取了种种卑鄙的手法，强行推翻了温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，但是非洲自由战士们看穿了修正主义者的阴谋诡计，并且给以彻底的揭露。他们在同苏修斗争中，时刻都把《毛主席语录》放在口袋里。一遇到问题，就从《毛主席语录》中找答案。苏修及其追随者为了达到不可告人的目的，甚至要调动塞浦路斯警察来恫吓这些自由战士。面对着法西斯高压手段，非洲自由战士们曾多次聚集在一起，一次又一次地大声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    正是毛主席的这些教导，给他们带来了巨大的勇气和信心。他们甚至在半夜里还集体朗读毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的语录和《为人民服务》一文中的语录：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”他们表示：他们做好了被捕、挨打甚至遭受镇压的一切准备，但是决不向苏联修正主义者屈服。义正词严痛斥苏修的背叛罪行
    在会上，这些非洲自由战士不顾非法会议的操纵者的专横阻挠，义正词严地谴责苏联现代修正主义者进行分裂活动和背叛亚非人民反帝斗争的严重罪行。西南非洲民族联盟代表指出：“现代修正主义的一整套政策、目的和动机违背世界革命群众的愿望和期望。因此，我们已经到了必须划清革命和反革命的界限的阶段。”斯威士兰进步党代表针对苏修的叛卖活动指出：“某些大国企图使亚非人民团结组织离开反帝道路，抽掉它的革命性，这是严重出卖亚非拉被压迫人民的利益。”退出这次非法会议的四个非洲民族主义组织的代表看透了苏修的叛徒本质，在一项联合声明中呼吁苏联人民起来大造苏联修正主义反动统治的反，使自己从修正主义统治下解放出来。
    非洲自由战士们在会上坚决维护关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的温尼巴决议，并且高度赞扬世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和中国文化大革命的伟大胜利。贝专纳人民党代表在发言时说：“我们欢呼和支持中国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和修正主义的正义斗争。我们欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃发展。”斯威士兰进步党代表在发言中说，我们就是要在一切国际会议上称颂毛主席和七亿中国人民，因为，“今天，中国是反帝斗争的堡垒。”他们欢呼：“毛泽东主席领导下的七亿中国人民愿意担任第五届大会的东道主，我们感到十分荣幸。”到北京去，见毛主席！
    最激动人心的场面发生在他们离开尼科西亚的前夕。四个非洲民族主义组织的代表团在所谓“组织委员会”会议上充分揭露了苏修的分裂活动并宣布退出会议以后，在清晨四点钟回到了旅馆。他们聚集在一个房间里，兴高采烈地放起他们特地带来的中国唱片《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。他们中许多人随着唱片的曲调齐声用中文欢唱：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。他为人民谋幸福……他是人民大救星……”。他们还高唱：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳……干革命靠的是毛泽东思想……”。这些中国革命歌曲显然使革命的非洲自由战士愈发精神抖擞，他们的歌声越来越嘹亮了。最后，他们又再一次高声朗读毛主席语录：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    这些非洲自由战士在离开尼科西亚前斗志昂扬。他们说：“我们胜利了！我们揭露了苏修的阴谋！”他们怀着无比喜悦的心情说：“我们要到北京去参加第五届亚非人民团结大会。我们渴望见到毛主席！”一位津巴布韦自由战士说：“今天，毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大统帅。”
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席啊！正是您的伟大思想在指导着非洲自由战士同美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义以及世界上的一切牛鬼蛇神进行着英勇的斗争。您的战无不胜的思想，将永远引导亚非革命人民以及全世界革命人民从一个胜利走向另一个新的胜利！
