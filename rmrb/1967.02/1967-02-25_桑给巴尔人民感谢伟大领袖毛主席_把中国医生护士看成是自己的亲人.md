The people of Zanzibar, who had long suffered under the brutal rule of British colonialism, had poor medical conditions for a long time. In response to the request of the revolutionary government of Zanzibar at that time, the Chinese government sent a medical team consisting of more than ten doctors and nurses from various specialties, crossing the vast ocean to arrive in Zanzibar in August 1964. The people of Zanzibar used a Swahili proverb to describe the arrival of the Chinese medical team as "bringing firewood during the rainy season."

The Chinese medical experts, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, regarded themselves as ordinary workers. They mingled with local medical staff, often proactively helping local nurses and workers to give injections, administer medicine, fold gauze, and clean the environment. They did not mind the working hours and often worked so hard that they missed meals and sleep. Some comrades even worked while sick. Local nurses often said, "Chinese doctors never get tired."

The Chinese medical staff were not afraid of dirt or hard work and took meticulous care of the patients, showing great concern. They often proactively fed the patients, gave them baths, and washed their clothes. Many patients praised, "The Chinese nurses are so good, they treat us like family."

One day in April last year, a Chinese obstetrician, after finishing her shift, checked the ward again and suddenly found that a patient, Asheena, had fallen into a coma due to placental abruption and massive bleeding after childbirth. At this point, the hemostatic injection was ineffective. The Chinese doctor quickly pressed both hands on the patient's lower abdomen and stood for more than two hours, finally saving the life of this African sister.

Once, a Chinese doctor saw a seriously ill old man from Zanzibar having difficulty moving, so he proactively carried him from the ground floor to the waiting room on the second floor. The old man was so moved that he could not speak, and finally he held the Chinese doctor's hand and said excitedly, "I love China." The Chinese doctor was also very moved and replied, "I love Zanzibar." Over the past two years, the Chinese medical team has saved more than 230 critically ill patients. An old doctor from Zanzibar sighed, "When the British doctors were here, many patients died mysteriously in the hospital; you came and saved so many people, truly the happiness of the people of Zanzibar!" Many people from Zanzibar, after recovering and being discharged from the hospital, often came to the hospital to visit the Chinese doctors and took photos with them. Many farmers also sincerely brought a old hen or fruits and eggs from the countryside to the city to give to the Chinese doctors. The Chinese doctors accepted the goodwill of their African brothers and sisters but politely declined all gifts, saying, "Chairman Mao taught us to come to Africa to serve the people, this is what we should do."

The people of Zanzibar thank Chairman Mao for sending them the Chinese doctors they love the most. A patient named Muhammad specially pasted a portrait of Chairman Mao by his bed. He told his roommates, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people. These Chinese doctors are so good because they are taught by Chairman Mao! We should thank the great leader Chairman Mao!"

    桑给巴尔人民感谢伟大领袖毛主席
    把中国医生护士看成是自己的亲人
    桑给巴尔人民过去遭受英国殖民主义的残酷统治，长期以来医疗条件很差。中国政府应当时桑给巴尔革命政府的要求，派出了一支由各科医生和护士十多人组成的医疗队，远涉重洋，在一九六四年八月来到桑给巴尔。桑给巴尔人民引用斯瓦希利谚语把中国医疗队的来到比喻为“雨季里，送来了柴火”。
    中国医务专家牢记毛主席的教导，把自己看成是普通的劳动者。他们同当地医务人员打成一片，经常主动帮助当地护士、工友给病人打针、喂药、折叠纱布，打扫卫生。在日常工作中从不计较工作时间，常常忙得耽误了吃饭和睡眠，有的同志还带着病坚持工作。当地护士常说：“中国医生就是不知道疲倦”。
    中国医务人员不怕脏，不怕累，对病人细心照料，体贴入微。他们经常主动给病人喂饭，擦澡，洗衣服。许多病人都称赞说：“中国护士真好，待我们象亲人一样。”
    去年四月的一天中午，一位中国妇产科医生下班时再次查看病房，突然发现产妇阿谢娜分娩后因胎盘早期剥离、大量出血而陷入昏迷。这时，打止血针已无效。这位中国医生忙用双手压住病妇的下腹部，一直坚持站了两个多小时，终于挽救了这位非洲姐妹的生命。
    有一次，中国医生看见一位病重的桑给巴尔老人行动很困难，就主动把他从楼下背到楼上候诊室。这位老人感动得说不出话来，最后他抓住中国医生的手，激动地说：“我爱中国。”中国医生也十分激动，回答说：“我爱桑给巴尔。”两年多来，中国医疗队共挽救了二百三十多个危重病人的生命。一位桑给巴尔老医生感慨地说：“过去英国医生在这里的时候，医院里好多病人死得不明不白；你们来后救活了这么多人，真是桑给巴尔人民的幸福！”许多桑给巴尔人，病愈出院后，还常到医院来看望中国医生，跟中国医生一起照个像。不少农民还情意真切地远道从乡下抱一只老母鸡，或带了水果、鸡蛋进城来送给中国医生，中国医生领受非洲兄弟姐妹的友情好意，但婉言谢绝了一切礼物，他们说：“毛主席教导我们来非洲为人民服务，这是我们应该做的事情。”
    桑给巴尔人民感谢毛主席派来了他们最爱戴的中国医生。住院病人穆罕默德特地在他的病床旁边贴上毛主席的像片。他向同房的病人说：“毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖。这些中国医生所以这么好都是毛主席教导出来的。我们要感谢伟大的领袖毛主席！”
