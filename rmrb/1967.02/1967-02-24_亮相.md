At this crucial moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses are seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, some revolutionary leading cadres in certain regions have stepped forward. They have made an appearance before the masses.

These leading cadres have openly declared their stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses. They have shown their revolutionary face. This is a good appearance!

Making such an appearance seems easy, but it is not so simple. It requires breaking through various concerns. One of these concerns is: I am a power-holder, and I have had some shortcomings and mistakes in the past. At this moment, will the masses trust me? Will the masses support me? This concern must be overcome.

One must believe in the masses. The revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought have keen eyes. They can clearly see whether you, as a power-holder, are a proletarian or a bourgeois. They can clearly see whether your appearance is genuine or false. If you are indeed a proletarian power-holder, and if you are sincerely making an appearance and proving with actual actions that you are truly standing with the proletarian revolutionary masses, then the revolutionary masses will definitely trust you and support you. They will not regard you as a power-holder taking the capitalist road, nor will they consider your appearance to be false.

The broad revolutionary masses not only know how to distinguish between enemies and friends and tell right from wrong, but they also know how to differentiate between primary and secondary issues. Of course, revolutionary cadres may have various shortcomings and mistakes; in the eyes of the revolutionary masses, these are secondary issues. As long as they seriously conduct self-examination, accept criticism from the masses, and resolutely correct their mistakes, the revolutionary masses will understand and forgive them. The revolutionary masses will never confuse primary and secondary issues, let alone reverse them. Revolutionary leading cadres should not be burdened by their own mistakes and shortcomings.

Even if some masses, due to insufficient understanding of you, temporarily do not trust you, it does not matter. Whether you are a proletarian or a bourgeois, whether you are genuine or false, the masses will eventually find out. As the saying goes, "A long journey reveals the strength of a horse, and a long time reveals the heart of a person." In the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is actually not necessary to wait for a long time to "see the heart of a person." As long as you resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, jointly rebel, fight shoulder to shoulder, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the masses will quickly recognize and trust you.

All these concerns, in the end, stem from the "self" factor. Revolutionary leading cadres who want to step forward and rebel must first rebel against the "self" in their minds, eliminate various selfish thoughts, and get rid of various mental burdens.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, over the past few months, the faces of leading cadres have basically become clear. In the previous period, due to various reasons, some revolutionary leading cadres have not yet made an appearance before the broad masses. Currently, the storm of the "January Revolution" is sweeping the nation. All revolutionary leading cadres should actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, make a decisive move, eliminate concerns, make their appearance, "go among the masses and be with the masses," and achieve new merits and make new contributions for the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    亮相
    辛午
    在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，有些地区的革命领导干部站出来了，他们在群众面前亮了相。
    这些领导干部公开表明自己站在无产阶级革命派这一边，他们亮的是革命之相。这个相亮得好！
    这种亮相，看来似乎容易，做来并不简单。它需要打破种种顾虑。顾虑之一，就是：我是一个当权派，过去也有一定的缺点和错误，此时此刻亮相，群众能信任我吗？群众会支持我吗？这种顾虑就必须打破。
    应当相信群众。毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，有一双锐利的火眼金睛，你这个当权派是无产阶级的还是资产阶级的？你的亮相是真的还是假的？他们清清楚楚，明明白白。如果你确实是一个无产阶级当权派，如果你是真心诚意地亮相，并且以实际行动证明你是真正站在无产阶级革命派这一边的，那么，革命群众就一定会信任你，就一定会支持你，决不会把你当作走资本主义道路的当权派，也不会把你的亮相看成是假的。
    广大的革命群众，不仅善于分清敌我，辨别真假，而且也善于区别主次。当然，革命干部也难免有这样那样的缺点和错误；这在革命群众看来，只是次要的方面。只要他们认真进行自我检查，接受群众批评，坚决改正，革命群众就会谅解他们。革命群众绝对不会主次不分，更加不会颠倒主次。革命的领导干部不要因为自己有错误缺点就背上包袱。
    即使有些群众由于对你了解不够，暂时不信任你，那也不要紧。是无产阶级的还是资产阶级的，是真还是假，群众迟早总会弄清楚的。俗话说：“路遥知马力，日久见人心。”在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，其实是不用“日久”就可以“见人心”的。只要你坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决站在无产阶级革命派这一边，和广大革命群众结合在一起，共同造反，并肩战斗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，群众很快就会认识你和信任你的。
    这顾虑，那顾虑，归根到底，还是一个“私”字在作祟。革命领导干部要站出来造反，首先就得在自己的头脑里造“私”字的反，破除各种私心杂念，去掉各种思想包袱。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，几个月来，领导干部的相，基本上都已经眉目清楚了。前一时期，由于各种原因，有些革命领导干部尚未在广大群众面前亮相。目前，“一月革命”的风暴正席卷全国。一切革命领导干部，都应当积极响应毛主席的号召，当机立断，消除顾虑，亮自己的相，“到群众里面去，和群众在一起”，为伟大的无产阶级文化大革命建新功立新劳！
