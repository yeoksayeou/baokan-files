A Congolese (Kinshasa) friend residing in Cuba has a deep affection for Chairman Mao. Every day, upon receiving the news bulletins published by the New China News Agency, he always reads the quotations from Chairman Mao on the cover first, before reading the news. Recently, he obtained a French edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and he was overjoyed as if he had found a treasure. Another Congolese (Kinshasa) friend who lives with him also has the same deep affection for Chairman Mao. The two of them eagerly read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together, and later, they took turns carrying it around to study.
