The Central Committee's letter has spread rapidly throughout the vast countryside via radio and newspapers. Various ethnic minority poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of people's communes have expressed their immense excitement, saying: Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao is forever in our hearts, and we will follow his words to the letter and carry out his instructions resolutely. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, to be the vanguard in seizing the revolution and promoting production, and together with the broad revolutionary cadres, to fan the flames of the Cultural Revolution and to achieve even greater success in spring plowing and production.

In regions such as Shanxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, Ningxia, Fujian, Guangdong, Anhui, and Hebei, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune and brigade cadres have all, while studying the Central Committee's letter, regarded seizing the revolution, promoting production, and immediately launching a new high tide of spring plowing and production as an important indicator of whether they are following Chairman Mao's words and acting according to his instructions.

Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Party branch of Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, said: The Central Committee's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants of the people's communes throughout the country and to cadres at all levels is timely and correct. We in Dazhai fully support it and will carry it out resolutely. Whether we can do a good job in spring plowing preparations is an important indication of whether we are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production." We in Dazhai will follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, turn Dazhai into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for victory in both revolution and production. Met Aotao, a poor peasant from Hongjin Brigade, Shaxi Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, said: We have studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production" repeatedly and deeply felt that without the revolutionary locomotive, production will derail and go down the capitalist road. We poor and lower-middle peasants must take the lead in making the revolution, defend Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to the death; at the same time, we must take the lead in preparing for spring plowing and strive to fire the first shot of spring plowing with all our might. The Central Committee's letter reached Hengshan County, where Chairman Mao surveyed the peasant movement in Hunan forty years ago. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres were overjoyed. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhurong Commune said: Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. He cares for us in every way and supports us. As early as 1927, Chairman Mao wrote in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "Without the poor peasants, there is no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution." We will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's expectations. In the cultural revolution, we will be the vanguard, and in production, we will be the pioneers, determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production. The Central Committee's letter, like a timely rain, reached the busy spring plowing season in Guangxi. Various ethnic minority poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of people's communes expressed their joy in different languages, enthusiastically shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" They unanimously expressed their determination to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter, to shoulder the double burden of revolution and production with their iron shoulders, and to fire the first shot of spring plowing. The Central Committee's letter reached Hainan Island, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres were filled with joy. They studied in the village squares and fields, igniting an unprecedented enthusiasm and vigor for seizing the revolution and promoting production, and launching a wave of seizing the opportunity, racing against the season, actively fertilizing, plowing, and rushing to transplant early rice.

The broad masses of liberated poor peasants and rural cadres in the suburbs of Lhasa, working hard in the fields despite the cold wind, said excitedly: The Central Committee's letter has sounded the drums for seizing the revolution and promoting production. Strongba, the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association in Fanzhen Township, said: "The rain from the sky only moistens the land, but the timely rain sent by Chairman Mao irrigates the red hearts of us liberated poor peasants. We will definitely do a better job of seizing the revolution and promoting production, using all our strength to do a good job in spring plowing, and strive to achieve the ninth consecutive bumper harvest since the democratic reforms." The Central Committee's letter reached the Umon Mountains, the banks of the Lancang River, and the shores of the Hong River, where the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!" echoed everywhere. An old poor peasant from Liangyuan Brigade, Dongfeng Commune, said excitedly: Chairman Mao and the Central Committee have written to us, urging us to do a good job in the revolution and spring plowing. We poor and lower-middle peasants must stand tall, seize the revolution, promote production, and fire the first shot of spring plowing. After receiving the Central Committee's letter, many poor and lower-middle peasants and brigade cadres in the suburbs of Fuzhou City immediately held a rally to seize the revolution, promote production, and fire the first shot of spring plowing. They are determined to make this year's agricultural production even better than previous years. In the revolutionary old base areas of Minxi, such as Changting and Zhangping counties, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and brigade cadres held a discussion, saying that they would listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, be the vanguard in the cultural revolution, and the spearhead in spring plowing and production, striving for a great agricultural harvest this year. After listening to the Central Committee's letter, the poor and lower-middle peasant members of the fourth production brigade of Dongwei Brigade, Weiqu Commune, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, decided to remember Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's instructions in their minds and put them into action. After studying the Central Committee's letter, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the revolutionary faction in Changjiang Brigade, Dongfanghong Commune, Changchun City, Jilin Province, said: The Central Committee's letter points out that landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must, under the supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants, continue to undergo labor reform sincerely. We poor and lower-middle peasants must hold the reins firmly. In our brigade, some bad elements are using clan relationships to disrupt the unity of the working people and stir up factional disputes. We not only have to fight them down but also dig out their backers. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Brigade, Red Flag Commune in the suburbs of Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province, expressed their determination to listen to Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, promote production, and launch a high tide of spring plowing and production. At the same time, they must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and absolutely not allow landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to cause trouble.

The Central Committee's letter inspired the cadres of people's communes at all levels to go to the production front line, discuss and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some cadres who had made mistakes in the past were all excited and expressed their determination to put down their burdens, start their engines, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and strive to make amends in spring plowing and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Wuliucun Brigade near Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia, said that Chairman Mao has spoken our hearts. Now our hearts are even brighter. The poor and lower-middle peasants, based on Chairman Mao's long-standing instructions of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," criticized some cadres for their passive thoughts of not daring to work because of their mistakes and encouraged them to stand tall, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, dare to carry out self-revolution, and do a good job in production. With the cadres having confidence, the enthusiasm of the community members was even greater. In Pinglu Brigade, Pinglu Commune, Wuming County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres said at a discussion meeting that Chairman Mao and the Central Committee have issued a great mobilization order, which we fully support and will carry out resolutely. The poor and lower-middle peasants said that we are not about overthrowing everything and negating everything. For cadres who have made mistakes, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and adopt the attitude of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." The next morning, the cadres of this brigade braved the spring rain and worked with the community members to vigorously promote spring plowing. Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's great call reached Daxinjiagou Brigade, Xiaodingjia Commune, Huang County, Shandong Province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres enthusiastically cheered and unanimously expressed their determination to carry it out resolutely. Wang Yongxing, the secretary of the brigade party committee, and Wang Wanyi, the deputy secretary, said: The Central Committee's letter points out the direction for our cadres to advance. We have made some mistakes in our work in the past. The revolutionary faction of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have criticized us sincerely according to Chairman Mao's principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," which is a great help to us. We must stand out resolutely, thoroughly criticize our erroneous thoughts, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, seize the revolution, promote production, do a good job in spring plowing, and create new achievements.

At the rally to seize the revolution and promote production in Changge County, Henan Province, some cadres said that we have shortcomings and mistakes, but as long as we listen to the Party and Chairman Mao's words and correct them well, the poor and lower-middle peasants will forgive us and support us. After seeing the Central Committee's letter, the brigade leader of the second production team of Hongcheng Commune, Qiongshan County, Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, on the one hand, examined his past mistakes to the community members, and on the other hand, earnestly promoted production. There were more than twenty mu of paddy fields that were not plowed well, so he actively organized the community members to study the Central Committee's letter and rushed to plow the fields well, so as to transplant rice seedlings as early as possible. After studying the Central Committee's letter, some cadres in Hongqi Brigade, Red Flag Commune in the suburbs of Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province, felt that the direction was clear. They criticized their erroneous thoughts of being afraid to lead production actively during the Cultural Revolution. They said excitedly that in the future, they would definitely strive to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, seize the revolution, promote production, and fight a good battle in spring plowing and production.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in factories, enterprises, finance, commerce, and supply departments in cities such as Shenyang, Hefei, Zhengzhou, and Jinan have also actively responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, mobilizing themselves to contribute to the great cause of supporting spring plowing and production.
