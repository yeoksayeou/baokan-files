China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism, and it is also a heavy blow to the entire capitalist system. The Cultural Revolution in China aims to uproot the revisionist roots that are corrupting the socialist state power of the Chinese people, so that it does not change color and degenerate into a capitalist regime like the socialist countries of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

In just nine short months, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been deeply and widely carried out among the 700 million Chinese people. The victory of the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party has driven the Red Guards and revolutionary rebels, who were established at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party, and to put the power in the hands of the great proletarian revolutionaries of China directly led by the great Chairman Mao Zedong. This great victory will enable the Chinese revolution to take a big step forward, and it will make the People's Republic of China even stronger, making China the strongest and greatest bastion against imperialism and modern revisionism, and a stronghold supporting world revolution.

The oppressed and exploited revolutionary people of Thailand remain steadfast in the face of various distortions and slanders against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The patriotic and revolutionary people of Thailand trust the great Chinese people who oppose American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries.

Chairman Mao's teachings on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and "a single spark can start a prairie fire" have been applied by the Thai people in their social struggles. In 1965, the revolutionary flames in Thailand first ignited in the northeast, then spread to the south, where they burned fiercely. In this year of 1967, the sparks from the south have spread to the central region, turning into a prairie fire that sweeps across the country. The flames of the people's revolution will surely reduce the American imperialist invaders and the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique to ashes.

    中国是反帝反修最强大的堡垒
    泰国  帕荣·朱拉暖
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命是对帝国主义和现代修正主义一个沉重打击，也是对整个资本主义制度的一次沉重打击。中国的文化大革命是要铲除腐蚀中国人民社会主义政权的修正主义根子，使之不要象社会主义国家中出现的南斯拉夫和苏联那样改变颜色和蜕化变质为资本主义政权。
    在短短九个月的时间里，中国的无产阶级文化大革命已经在七亿中国人民群众中深入和广泛地开展。毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，推动了在文化大革命初期建立起来的红卫兵和革命造反派，从一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺权，使政权掌握在伟大的毛泽东主席直接领导的中国无产阶级革命派的手里。这一伟大胜利将使中国的革命向前迈进一大步，并将使中华人民共和国更加强大，使中国成为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的最强大和最伟大的堡垒，成为支持世界革命的坚强堡垒。
    被压迫被剥削的革命的泰国人民，在各种歪曲和污蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命的宣传面前毫不动摇。爱国的、革命的泰国人民信赖反对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和一切反动派的伟大的中国人民。
    毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”和“星星之火，可以燎原”的教导，已被泰国人民运用于社会斗争的实践了。一九六五年泰国的革命烈火首先在东北部燃起，然后吹到南部，在那里燃起熊熊的烈火。在这一九六七年，南部的星火又蔓延到中部，变成燎原的烈火，席卷全国。人民革命烈火一定要把美帝国主义侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团烧成灰烬。
