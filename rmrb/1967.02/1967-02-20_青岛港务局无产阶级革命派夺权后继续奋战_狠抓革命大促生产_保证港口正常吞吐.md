The revolutionary rebels of Qingdao Port Bureau have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." After seizing power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party on January 28, they immediately formed two teams: one for revolution and one for production. In the process of focusing on revolution and boosting production, they repelled the counterattack by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, defending the power they had seized. At the same time, the revolutionary rebel workers united with all revolutionary staff to defend their production posts, smashing the sabotage plots of a small group of reactionaries.

The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary staff of the entire bureau have channeled the revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed during the Cultural Revolution into production. They fear neither the bitter cold nor the snow and work day and night to load and unload cargo, significantly reducing the time ships and trains spend in the port. In the ten days since seizing power, the time trains spend in the port has been reduced by 0.33 hours compared to January, the time domestic ships spend in the port has been reduced by 0.65 days compared to January, and the time foreign ships spend in the port has been reduced by 0.82 days compared to January. For key materials, they load and transport them as soon as they arrive, ensuring there is no backlog. They have also rushed to load over 20,000 tons of coal for power generation to Shanghai, strongly supporting the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai. On February 2, the revolutionary workers of the Fifth Loading and Unloading Team were unloading cargo for trains at the dock. During the time the trains were being moved, they proactively loaded 108 tons of cargo onto ships. On February 7, despite the rain, the revolutionary rebels, with a sense of ownership, braved the weather to unload timber, load pig iron, and other materials that are not affected by moisture, ensuring that operations were not interrupted. Thanks to the hard work of the revolutionary rebel workers, port operations have been ensured, and victories in both revolution and production have been achieved.

    狠抓革命大促生产
    保证港口正常吞吐
    新华社济南十九日电　青岛港务局无产阶级革命派坚决响应毛主席提出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在一月二十八日夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权后，立即组成了抓革命和抓生产的两套班子。他们在狠抓革命、大促生产中，打退了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一手策划的“反夺权”的围攻，保卫了已夺到的大权。在这同时，无产阶级革命派工人团结全局革命职工，坚守生产岗位，粉碎了一小撮反动家伙破坏生产的阴谋诡计。
    全局无产阶级革命派和革命职工把在文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上，不怕严寒冰雪，昼夜抢装抢卸，大大缩短了车船在港口停留的时间。夺权后十几天来，火车在港停留时间比一月份缩短了零点三三小时，国轮在港停留时间比一月份缩短了零点六五天，外轮在港停留时间比一月份缩短了零点八二天。对重点物资，他们是随到随运，决不积压。他们还抢装了两万多吨运往上海的电力用煤，有力地支援了上海的无产阶级革命派。二月二日第五装卸队的革命工人在码头为火车卸货时，利用火车调动的时间，又主动去为轮船装了一百零八吨货物。二月七日阴雨，港内许多怕湿的物资不能装卸，无产阶级革命派战士以主人翁精神，冒雨卸木材、装生铁和矾石等不怕湿的物资，使作业没有中断。由于无产阶级革命派工人艰苦奋战，有力地保证了港口吞吐正常，夺取了革命、生产双胜利。
