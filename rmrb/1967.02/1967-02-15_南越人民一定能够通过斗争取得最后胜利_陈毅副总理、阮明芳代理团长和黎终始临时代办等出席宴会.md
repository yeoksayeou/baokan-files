The people of South Vietnam will surely achieve final victory through struggle.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Deputy Head of the Mission Nguyen Minh Hoang, and Acting Charge d'Affaires Le Cong Chi attended the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, February 14th - The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a report meeting this afternoon to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the unified day of the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam.

Deputy Head of the Mission Nguyen Minh Hoang of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's Permanent Mission to China was invited to deliver a report at the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Xu Liqing. He praised the military and civilians of South Vietnam for fully demonstrating the great power of people's war in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, achieving one great victory after another.

Xu Liqing said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: 'The people of South Vietnam will surely achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and make a contribution to the peaceful reunification of the motherland.' We firmly believe that no matter how the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, or how they conspire with the Soviet revisionist leadership and their accomplices to play 'peace talks,' they cannot save themselves from complete failure. The final victory will surely belong to the heroic military and civilians of South Vietnam and all the people of Vietnam."

Xu Liqing said, "The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to continue to hold high the banner of supporting Vietnam and resisting the U.S., to make the greatest national sacrifices, and to resolutely fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers to defeat the American aggressors until the American bandits are completely driven out of Vietnam."

In the midst of warm applause, Nguyen Minh Hoang introduced the heroic struggle and experiences of the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam. He pointed out that the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have developed from being bare-handed and armed with bamboo spears into a heroic army, a steel army. Today, they are resolutely fighting against the head of the imperialist camp, U.S. imperialism, to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the motherland, making an active contribution to the revolutionary movement of the people of the world and the defense of world peace. Nguyen Minh Hoang said, "Chairman Mao Zedong has said: 'We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam.' This is the voice representing the will of 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese people and the Chinese government have consistently provided comprehensive, effective, thorough, and immense assistance to our struggle. He expressed gratitude on behalf of the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam.

Attendees included Pan Zhenwu, Xu Wenlie, and more than 800 leaders and officers from various military branches and services.
