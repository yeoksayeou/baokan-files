The poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, together with revolutionary grassroots cadres, are vigorously promoting both revolution and production, launching a new high tide in spring farming.

At present, the fields of Daqing are bustling with activity. The lands destroyed by floods last year have been rebuilt with new stone terraces and thicker soil layers. The lands on the stone slopes that need consolidation and improvement have undergone comprehensive basic construction. The peasants are diligently applying fertilizer, which is more abundant and of better quality than last year, with half of it already applied to the fields. Various spring farming tools have been repaired and are ready for use. Seeds have begun to sprout in trials. Several dozen formerly emaciated donkeys and horses have been well-fed and are now plump and strong. All these signs indicate that the heroic people of Daqing have laid a decisive foundation for this year's production.

During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing have steadfastly united with revolutionary grassroots cadres, trusting them, supporting them, and relying on them to shoulder the burden of production. The revolutionary cadres, in turn, have stood firmly with the revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, leading both revolution and production with unwavering determination. Since the beginning of the rural cultural revolution, Party branch secretary Chen Yonggui has subjected himself to criticism and has led the revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants in an uncompromising struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants have elected Chen Yonggui to the brigade cultural revolution committee and have chosen him, along with brigade leader Jia Chengran and deputy brigade leader Jia Laiheng, to lead production. After accepting the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Chen Yonggui has redoubled his efforts, emphasizing politics in leading production. He said, "We will always stand with the poor and lower-middle peasants and always stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, "We not only are good at demolishing an old world, we also are good at building a new world," Daqing brigade has, in organizing and managing production, displayed the daring and pioneering spirit of communism and the pragmatic spirit of seeking truth from facts. For example, in the past, production plans were made by the management committee and then submitted to the masses for discussion, which tended to limit the masses' enthusiasm and creativity. When drafting this year's plan, they abolished this old system and adopted a bottom-up approach, first having the masses draft their annual attendance and work plans and propose brigade production increase plans, and then consolidating these into a practical and feasible annual agricultural production plan.

Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing have stood firm against the onslaught of counter-revolutionary economism. During discussions on year-end distribution, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road incited the masses to "divide everything up and eat it all." The revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing said, "The collective economy is our backbone. Our revolution is not for enjoyment or for personal gain, but for building socialism and communism. We must always put the interests of the collective economy first, even if it means getting a little less for ourselves, we must leave more for the collective." They unanimously decided to reduce each workday's share by one jiao, accumulating an additional 3,800 yuan for the collective, and each person received a little more grain than last year, selling all surplus grain to the state. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bad elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line incited the masses to flaunt wealth and waste collective and state property.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution," the poor and lower-middle peasants are thrifty in all their undertakings, saving every penny for the collective. Red Guards from other brigades asked the brigade to provide funds for red armbands, but the Red Guards of Daqing made their own armbands. Some people from other brigades stopped production to travel around, but the Red Guards of Daqing firmly refused, saying, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'grasp revolution and promote production.' We must strike both drums of revolution and production." They correctly handled the relationship between the individual, the collective, and the state, opening up new sources of income and saving old ones, strengthening and consolidating the collective economy, and creating good conditions for this year's production investment.

Studying and applying the "Three Old Articles," eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, educating oneself, and combating bourgeois ideology in one's own mind, they further established the idea of producing for revolution. During the winter, while carrying out basic farmland construction, the poor and lower-middle peasants took Chairman Mao's works with them to the fields. During rest periods, they repeatedly studied the "Three Old Articles." They said, "We are determined, fearing no sacrifice, and forgetting personal interests. No difficulty can stop us. We must do everything for the revolution and keep the seven hundred million people and the revolutionary people of the world in our hearts!" In the bitterly cold days of the third lunar month, the peasants worked on the fields, their hands and feet cracked from the cold. They bandaged their wounds and continued working. After two snowfalls, the peasants broke through the snow twice, thawing the frozen soil and leveling the land. Despite the severe cold, many peasants working at the foot of Hu Tou Mountain did not return home for lunch, having their families bring them food to the fields, eating and resting there. After studying the "Three Old Articles," revolutionary peasants eliminated selfish thoughts, and the attendance rate was significantly higher than in previous years, making a great contribution to collective production.

Currently, the busy spring farming season has arrived. The revolutionary masses of Daqing are full of fighting spirit, pushing the spring sowing work to a new high tide, grasping revolution, promoting production, and vowing to achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year!

    大寨贫下中农坚决执行毛主席的干部政策
    坚定不移地团结革命基层干部
    把革命和生产两副重担挑起来
    革命群众斗志昂扬，正把春播工作推向新高潮，誓夺生产大丰收
    据新华社太原十四日电　山西昔阳县大寨大队的贫下中农社员，同革命的基层干部一道，大抓革命，猛促生产，掀起春耕生产的新高潮。
    目前，大寨的田野上到处呈现出一派欣欣向荣的动人景象：去年被洪水冲毁的土地，已经修起了崭新的石堾，加厚了土层；需要巩固提高的石坡上的土地，已作了全面的基本建设；社员们正冒着风寒紧张地送肥，肥料比去年积的又多又好，已把半数肥料送到地里；各种春播农具都已整修一新；种子开始发芽试验；几十头瘦弱的驴马，喂养得膘肥体壮。这一切，表明着英雄的大寨人已为今年生产打下了决定性基础。
    大寨贫下中农在文化大革命运动中，坚定不移地团结革命的基层干部，相信他们，拥护他们，依靠他们，把生产的重担交给他们去挑。革命的干部毫不动摇地和革命的贫下中农站在一起，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，积极完成领导生产的任务。农村文化革命开始以后，党支部书记陈永贵既把自己当作革命的对象，又把自己做为革命的领头人，一面引火烧身，一面和革命的贫下中农站在一起，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行不调和的斗争。革命的贫下中农把陈永贵选到大队文化革命委员会，并推选他和生产大队长贾承让、副大队长贾来恒负责领导生产。陈永贵接受了贫下中农的重托后，比往常干劲更足，突出政治，领导生产。他说：“我们永远和贫下中农站在一起，永远站在毛主席革命路线一边！”
    大寨大队遵照毛主席的教导：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”在组织、管理生产上，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格和实事求是的精神。例如，过去制订生产计划，是管理委员会先做出方案，然后交给群众讨论，容易限制群众的积极性和创造性。在制订今年计划的时候，他们废除了这个旧制度，采取自下而上走群众路线的办法，先由群众自己订出全年出勤到工计划，提出大队增产计划，然后集中起来，订出了一个积极而又切实可行的全年农业生产计划。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨贫下中农，面对反革命经济主义妖风的袭击，巍然屹立，坚不动摇。在讨论年终分配时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑动群众“分光吃尽”，大寨革命的贫下中农说：“集体经济是我们的靠山，我们革命不是为了享受，图吃图富，是为了建设社会主义，建设共产主义，要永远把集体经济的利益放在第一位，宁肯少分一点，也要多留一些。”他们一致通过每个劳动日少分一角钱，多给集体积累了三千八百元，每人比去年多分了一些口粮，把余粮全部卖给了国家。农村党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏家伙挑动群众讲阔气、闹排场，挥霍集体和国家的财产。
    贫下中农社员遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，勤俭办一切事业，能为集体节省一分钱，就省一分钱。外队不少红卫兵让队里出钱做红袖章，大寨的红卫兵都是自己拿钱做红袖章。外队有些人停止生产外出串连，大寨的红卫兵坚决不干，说：“毛主席教导我们‘抓革命，促生产’，我们要把革命、生产两面锣鼓都敲响。”他们正确处理个人和集体、国家三者之间的关系，开源节流，壮大和巩固了集体经济，为今年生产投资创造了良好条件。
    活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，自己教育自己，自己造自己头脑里资产阶级思想的反，进一步树立为革命搞生产的思想。在冬季进行农田基本建设中，贫下中农上地也带着毛主席著作，休息时就反复学习“老三篇”，学了就用。他们说，下定决心，不怕牺牲，忘了个人利益，什么困难都能排除。我们要一切为革命，要把七亿人民和世界革命人民牢记在心！在滴水成冰的三九天，社员们修田整地，手脚冻得裂开了口子，包扎好伤口，又继续干开了；下了两场雪，社员们两次破雪开道，凿开冻土整地。冒着严寒，战斗在虎头山下的许多社员，中午都不回家，让家里人把饭捎到地里，在地头吃饭、休息。革命社员学习“老三篇”以后，消除私心杂念，出勤率比往年大大提高，为集体生产作出了很大贡献。
    目前，春耕大忙已经来到，大寨的革命群众斗志昂扬，正把春耕播种工作推向新高潮，抓革命，促生产，誓夺今年农业生产的大丰收！
