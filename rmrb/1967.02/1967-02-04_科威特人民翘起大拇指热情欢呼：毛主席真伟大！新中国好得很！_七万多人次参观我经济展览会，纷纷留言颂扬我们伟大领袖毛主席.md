January is the golden season in Kuwait, much like the early spring in Beijing. It was during this time that the People's Republic of China's Economic and Trade Exhibition was held in Kuwait.

The exhibition created a sensation throughout Kuwait as soon as it opened. Visitors streamed in continuously, especially on holidays when the crowds were even more enthusiastic. In the two weeks the exhibition was on display, over 200,000 people in the city of Kuwait, with a population of more than 200,000, visited the exhibition. Many visitors, after seeing the exhibition, gave a thumbs up to the Chinese staff and said, "China is truly great, Mao Zedong Thought is truly great. I never imagined that China could achieve such great progress in such a short time. This exhibition has completely refuted all the slander and distortions about China by imperialists and reactionaries."

On the second day of the exhibition, an elderly worker brought his entire family to visit. After seeing the exhibition, he said, "I have a lot to say after seeing the Chinese exhibition. The Chinese exhibition is too wonderful, too perfect. In the past, I only heard the imperialists and reactionaries' nonsense about New China, but I knew very little about China. After seeing the exhibition, I understand why they are so desperate to oppose New China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—because they fear China's great influence and worry about their own demise." He became more and more excited: "The people of New China led by Chairman Mao Zedong are the most loyal and reliable friends of the Arab people and all the people of the world. China is the true socialism, the model for the people of the world. Please believe that the Arab people will always stand with the Chinese people."

Every day, many visitors came to inquire where they could buy Chairman Mao's works and photographs. A hotel service worker told the Chinese staff that he had a picture of Chairman Mao cut from a newspaper. He said, "I really hope to get a recent photo of him! To make a revolution, one must study Chairman Mao's works."

One day, a young student who had visited the Chinese exhibition for several days in a row told the Chinese staff that he had a photo of Vice Chairman Lin Biao. He greatly admired how Vice Chairman Lin Biao used Mao Zedong Thought to educate the Chinese army, making it a truly revolutionary force. He also said, "I really want to get a photo of Chairman Mao!" He repeatedly asked where he could buy the Arabic version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He also took several Chairman Mao badges to give to his friends.

Every day, many people brought cameras or hired photographers to take pictures in front of the large portrait of Chairman Mao and the photo of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards. Once, a young man asked to take a picture with a Chinese staff member in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. He tightly held the Chinese staff member's hand and said, "The people of New China led by Chairman Mao are the true friends of the Arab people. This photo symbolizes the friendship and unity between the Arab people and the Chinese people."

In the exhibition hall, people often took out photos they had taken in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to show the Chinese staff, then gave a thumbs up and said, "Chairman Mao is truly great, New China is excellent. Long live Chairman Mao!" One day, an elderly worker from Kuwait asked the Chinese staff to teach him to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese. After finishing his visit, he shouted in Chinese at the entrance of the exhibition hall, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

One day, six workers from Kuwait's famous oil field, Ahmadi, came to visit the exhibition. After watching the machine tool performance, they all took off their coats in front of the Chinese staff. It turned out that each of them had a shiny Chairman Mao badge on their chest. Then they pointed to their hearts and gave a thumbs up, expressing their boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The moving stories of the Kuwaiti people's love for Chairman Mao and New China can also be seen in the thousands of messages left by the visitors. One visitor's message fully expressed the feelings of the majority of visitors. He wrote: The Chinese exhibition is the best exhibition held in Kuwait. From the exhibition, one can see the victory of great Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people have turned Mao Zedong Thought into material force. The victory of China is the victory of the people of the world. I wish the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao, eternal prosperity. Long live Chairman Mao!

The exhibition team members were greatly encouraged to see the Kuwaiti people's love for New China and the great leader Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, raise their consciousness, and serve the people of China and the world.

The happiness of being able to take a photo in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait. The photo shows a Kuwaiti family taking a commemorative photo in front of Chairman Mao's portrait with boundless respect for Chairman Mao.

    科威特人民翘起大拇指热情欢呼：
    毛主席真伟大！新中国好得很！
    七万多人次参观我经济展览会，纷纷留言颂扬我们伟大领袖毛主席
    每年一月是科威特的黄金季节，有如北京的初春。中华人民共和国经济贸易展览会就在这个时候，在科威特举办了。
    展览会一开幕，就轰动了整个科威特。参观的人川流不息，特别是假日，观众更加踊跃。在展出的两周中，二十多万人口的科威特市前往参观的人数达七万多人次。许多观众在看完展览后，翘起大拇指对中国工作人员说：中国太伟大了，毛泽东思想太伟大了。真没有想到，中国在短短的时间里，在各方面都取得了这样大的进步。这次展览会，把帝国主义和反动派对中国的一切污蔑和歪曲宣传都冲垮了。
  展览会开幕的第二天，一位老工人带着全家参观了展览后说：“我看了中国展览会，有满腹心里话要说。中国展览会太精彩了，太完美了。过去我只听到帝国主义和反动派对新中国的胡说八道，但对中国了解得很少。看了展览会，我更明白它们为什么这样拚命地反对新中国和中国文化大革命，——因为它们恐惧中国的巨大影响，担心自己的灭亡。”他越说越激动：“毛泽东主席领导的新中国人民，是阿拉伯人民和全世界人民最忠实可靠的朋友，中国是真正的社会主义，是世界人民的榜样。请你们相信，我们阿拉伯人民永远是和中国人民站在一起的。”
    每天都有不少观众来打听什么地方可以买到毛主席著作，得到毛主席的照片。有一位旅馆服务员告诉中国工作人员，他有一张从报纸上剪下来的毛主席像。他说：“我多么希望得到一张他老人家最近的照片啊！要革命就要学习毛主席的著作。”
    一天，一个已经接连几天来参观中国展览会的青年学生对中国工作人员说，他有一张林彪副主席的照片，他非常钦佩林彪同志用毛泽东思想教育中国军队，使中国军队成为一支真正的革命队伍。他还说：“我多么想得到一张毛主席的照片啊！”他一再打听什么地方可以买到阿拉伯文版的《毛泽东选集》。他还要了好几枚毛主席像章去送给他的朋友。
    每天都有许多人带着照像机或请摄影师在毛主席巨幅照片和毛主席接见红卫兵的照片前照像。有一次，一个青年人要求和一个中国工作人员在毛主席像前握着手照像。他紧紧地拉着中国人员的手说：“毛主席领导的新中国人民是阿拉伯人民的真正朋友，我们这张照片，象征着阿拉伯人民和中国人民的友爱团结。”
    在展览馆里，经常有人从口袋里掏出他们在毛主席像前拍摄的照片给中国工作人员看，然后翘起大拇指说：“毛主席真伟大，新中国好得很。毛主席万岁！”有一天，一个科威特老工人要中国人员教他用中国话喊“毛主席万岁！”他参观完毕，就在展览馆门口用刚学会的中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    有一天，有六个工人从科威特著名的石油产地艾哈麦地赶来参观。看完机床表演以后，他们一起对着中国工作人员把外衣揭开。原来他们每个人胸前都戴着一枚金灿灿的毛主席像章。然后他们指着自己的心，翘起大拇指，表示对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬。
    科威特人民热爱毛主席，热爱新中国的动人事迹还可以从数千条观众留言中表达出来。其中有一位观众的留言充分表达了广大观众的心意，他写道：中国展览会，是在科威特举办的最好的展览会。从展览会上可以看出伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，中国人民把毛泽东思想变成了物质力量。中国的胜利是世界人民的胜利。祝福中国人民有伟大的毛泽东主席的英明领导。祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    展览团的工作人员，看到科威特人民对新中国，对伟大领袖毛主席这样热爱，受到很大鼓舞。他们表示要更好地学习毛主席著作，提高觉悟，为中国人民和世界人民服务。
