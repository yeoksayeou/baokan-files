	We Must Not Be Silent, We Must Act!
	– An American Woman's Protest Against the Vietnam War

	The criminal war of aggression waged by American imperialism in Vietnam has aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction and opposition among the American people. People from various strata in the United States are rising up in various ways, including demonstrations, marches, rallies, writing letters, and appeals, to protest against Johnson's policy of aggression against Vietnam. The recent example is the strong demonstration held by American women on February 15 in front of the Pentagon in Washington.

	The American weekly "National Guardian" recently published a protest letter from an American woman named Karen Babenna. She participated in a demonstration and march at the port of Chicago in California (a center for transporting military supplies to Vietnam) and was arrested along with other demonstrators. Although this protest letter only reflects the feelings of an ordinary American woman, it shows that Johnson's war of aggression against Vietnam is completely contrary to the will and interests of the American people and is unpopular among the American people. Below is an excerpt from the protest letter:

	As the wife of an air force officer, I am deeply worried about my country's (the United States) intervention in Vietnamese internal affairs. All the evidence I have obtained strongly indicates that we have no right to be there. Therefore, I cannot agree to my husband participating in a war of aggression against Vietnam.

	Reports on nuclear war as if it were a game are constantly distributed to military families. All military wives are forced to watch a film promoting chemical warfare. This film shows the effects of various toxic gases and a flock of lambs being poisoned by gas. Unbelievably, just a few months after watching this film, these chemicals are being used daily against the Vietnamese people. I tried to convey my thoughts to my husband who is fighting there, and finally I wrote a letter to him, reminding him of the Nuremberg trials of war criminals and asking him to remember the responsibility for his actions.

	When our horrifying atrocities are reported from Vietnam, our heinous crimes become crystal clear. I can no longer remain indifferent to this. I think that any effort to oppose such crimes, no matter how small, is better than allowing such crimes to continue. Therefore, I, along with my children, distributed leaflets opposing these crimes in various churches and participated in demonstrations against these crimes.

	I deeply feel that our government is using the most brutal and inhumane means we have ever seen to suppress the liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people. Killing and torturing unarmed men, women, and children... Our napalm bombs continue to wreak havoc in the Vietnamese countryside, killing innocent civilians. All these crimes are committed in the name of "freedom" and "democracy."

	However, our government is not satisfied; it has already expanded its brutal actions to North Vietnam and is preparing to expand to its ultimate goal – China. Therefore, our anguish has become unbearable.

	My conscience urges me to try to stop their crimes.

### 不能沉默，必须行动！——一个美国妇女对侵越战争的控诉

    不能沉默，必须行动！
    ——一个美国妇女对侵越战争的控诉
    美帝国主义侵略越南的罪恶战争，激起了美国广大人民日益强烈的不满和反对。美国各阶层的人民群众，正在用各种方式，包括示威、游行、集会、写信、呼吁等方式，起来抗议约翰逊政府的侵越政策。美国妇女二月十五日在华盛顿五角大楼前举行的强烈示威，就是最近的一个例子。
    美国《国民前卫》周刊不久前发表了一位名叫卡伦·巴本娜的美国妇女的控诉书。她曾在美国加利福尼亚州芝加哥港口（运送侵越军火的一个中心站）参加示威游行，并和其他示威者一起遭到当局的逮捕。这个控诉书虽然只是反映了一个普通的美国妇女的心情，但是从中可以看出，约翰逊政府侵略越南的战争，是完全违反美国人民的意志和利益的，在美国人民中是不得人心的。下面是这个控诉书的摘译：
    作为一个空军军官的妻子，我对我国（美国）政府介入越南内政深为焦虑。我所得到的一切证据，都有力地说明我们无权到那里去。因此，我不能同意我的丈夫去参加一场侵略越南的战争。
    把核战争当作儿戏的时事通讯，不断分发给军人眷属。所有军人的妻子都被强迫去看一部宣传化学战的影片。这部影片拍下各种有毒瓦斯的作用，以及一群羔羊受到瓦斯毒害的情景。想不到看完这部影片不过几个月，这些化学品已在天天对越南人民使用了。我曾设法把我的想法告诉正在那里参战的丈夫，我最后写了一封信给他，提醒他注意纽伦堡战犯法庭的审讯，并要他记住对自己的所作所为应负的责任。
    当我们的可怕的暴行从越南报道出来的时候，我们的滔天罪行已变得再清楚不过了。对此，我不能再无动于衷了。我想，任何反对这类罪行的努力，不管是多么渺小，总比默许这类罪行要好一些。因此，我带同我的孩子们，在各个教堂散发反对这类罪行的传单，参加反对这类罪行的示威游行。
    我深深感到，我国政府正在以我们有生以来所见到的最残暴和最不人道的手段，来镇压越南人民的解放斗争。对手无寸铁的男人、妇女和小孩进行屠杀和拷打……我们的凝固汽油弹继续在越南农村肆虐，杀害无辜平民。所有这些罪行，都是在“自由”和“民主”的名义下进行的。
    但是，我国政府并不满足，它已经把自己的残暴行为扩大到越南北方去了，而且正在准备扩大到它最后目标——中国去。因此，我们的苦恼已经变得难以忍受了。
    我的良心催促我起来设法制止他们的罪行。
