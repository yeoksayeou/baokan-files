To the health and longevity of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha! To the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people!

Shanghai troops hosted a banquet to see off the Albanian military delegation.

Comrade Baluku highly praised the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Comrade Wang Shusheng, on behalf of Comrade Lin Biao and the Military Commission, and representing the entire army, warmly congratulated the Albanian delegation on their successful visit. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao wished that the great beacon of socialism in Europe, Albania, would shine even brighter.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 9th - Tonight, the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Shanghai held a banquet to warmly see off Comrade Bekir Baluku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, Comrade Hito Cako, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, and the entire Albanian military delegation led by them.

Vice Chairman of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, and member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Yao Wenyuan, attended the banquet.

Comrade Wang Shusheng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of Defense, who accompanied the Albanian comrades to Shanghai, and responsible comrades of the Shanghai garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liu Wenzhi, Chen Shifa, Zhou Renjie, and Ji Yingwu, also attended the banquet.

Ambassador Vasili Nataneli of Albania to China was invited to attend the banquet.

At the banquet filled with fraternal revolutionary and combatant friendship, Comrade Baluku delivered an enthusiastic speech. He said, "During our one-month stay in fraternal China, we felt as if we were at home, among comrades-in-arms fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries. Everywhere in China, we saw men, women, old and young, soldiers and cadres of the People's Liberation Army, with pure political sentiments, reciting the words of Comrade Mao Zedong in his congratulatory message to our Party's Fifth Congress: 'We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are two-faced. Our revolutionary and combatant friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests.' 'Believe us, no matter what happens in the world, our two parties, our two peoples, will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together.' This reflects the sincere friendship between our two parties, our two peoples, and our two armies. The Albanian people and army have the same feelings for the Communist Party of China, the Chinese army, and Comrade Mao Zedong. We are proud to have such comrades and comrades-in-arms."

He said, "Our Party and Comrade Hoxha teach the people: The Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the People's Republic of China, are today, tomorrow, and in the future, a bastion of revolution. The Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong is the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism and internationalism. Every revolutionary, every true Marxist-Leninist, should defend the Communist Party of China from the attacks of imperialism and revisionism. Anyone who opposes China, attacks the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, will fall into the swamp of opportunism and revisionism, will be against Marxism-Leninism, will be counter-revolutionary."

Comrade Baluku said, "In our struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, we have received strong support from Marxist-Leninists, true revolutionaries. The Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong firmly defends the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Our Party led by Comrade Hoxha fights shoulder to shoulder with the Communist Party of China. He said, the cause of Marxism-Leninism, the cause of revolution, has tightly bound our two parties, our two peoples, and our two armies together. Our combatant friendship is built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, has withstood the test of storms and tempests, and is eternal. No force or conspiracy can destroy it. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, 'We will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together.' Therefore, the content of our friendship has common goals, common causes, and shared ideals. We are comrades and comrades-in-arms."

When talking about his impressions of visiting China, Comrade Baluku said, "All members of our delegation believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong is developing to a broader and deeper stage and has achieved victories. This cultural revolution is a broad and deep mass movement. China has indeed become a large classroom for studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This cultural revolution has raised the class consciousness of the revolutionary masses, struck down a handful of miserable creatures who oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, and thrown them into the garbage heap. Our working class fully supports the revolutionary faction in China. He said, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and youth, revolutionary cadres in China are closely connected with the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, which is the fundamental characteristic of the thriving Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Through the cultural revolution, China is cultivating a new revolutionary generation, passing down the banner of Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation."

Comrade Baluku said, "To be able to carry out such a large-scale cultural revolution shows your strength. Only a party as strong as this, a party that is closely connected with the masses, dares to initiate this cultural revolution. Let the Moscow revisionists try it, dare they initiate such a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution like China's! If they dare to try, it can be asserted that they will be finished within twenty-four hours; let them try what we two countries have done, handing over weapons to the people, it can be asserted that within twenty-four hours, these weapons will explode beside their heads. They dare not, because they fear the people, because they are anti-people groups, they have degenerated, or are on the road to capitalist restoration."

Comrade Baluku highly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army created and led by Chairman Mao. He said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army as solid as a rock. This army is led by proletarian politics, with Mao Zedong Thought as its driving force, which is its most important weapon, making it a powerful and invincible proletarian army. The People's Liberation Army is loyal to the Party and the people, acts according to the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings, actively participates in and defends the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supports the revolutionary left, and becomes a powerful weapon of proletarian dictatorship."

Comrade Wang Shusheng, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, the Central Military Commission, and representing the Ministry of National Defense and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, warmly congratulated Comrade Baluku and Comrade Cako on the success of their visit to China led by them.

He said, "Comrade Baluku and the Albanian comrades have limitless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, highly evaluate the great thought of Mao Zedong, with fiery passion and poetic language, highly evaluate our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the revolutionary rebellious actions of our hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, highly praise the brilliant achievements they have made in the cultural revolution, which makes us deeply grateful. This vividly shows the most precious and greatest proletarian internationalist friendship between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies of China and Albania."

Comrade Wang Shusheng said, "Chairman Mao said: 'The two countries of China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but our hearts are connected.' Comrade Hoxha said, we are 'comrades-in-arms in stormy weather.' The great cause of Marxism-Leninism tightly connects us together. Let us always stand shoulder to shoulder, together with the revolutionary peoples of the world, to fight against imperialism led by the United States, to fight against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, to fight against the reactionaries of all countries, to struggle together to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without the system of exploitation! The final victory will definitely be ours!"

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao also toasted at the banquet, wishing that the great beacon of socialism in Europe, Albania, would shine even brighter, wishing Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha good health and longevity, and wishing that the eternal, unbreakable friendship between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies of China and Albania would last forever.

At the beginning of the banquet, Comrade Liu Wenzhi, responsible comrade of the Shanghai garrison of the People's Liberation Army, spoke. He, on behalf of the officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison of the People's Liberation Army, extended the most cordial greetings to Comrade Baluku and Comrade Cako, and to all members of the Albanian military delegation.

    祝毛主席和霍查同志健康长寿！祝中阿战斗友谊万古长青！
    上海部队设宴欢送阿军事代表团
    巴卢库同志高度赞扬伟大毛泽东思想、中国文化大革命和中国人民解放军  王树声同志受林彪同志和军委委托并代表全军热烈祝贺阿代表团访问成功  张春桥同志祝阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义的明灯更加明亮
    新华社上海九日电　中国人民解放军驻上海部队今晚举行宴会，热烈欢送阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科同志以及由他们率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团全体同志。
    中央文化革命小组副组长张春桥同志、中央文化革命小组成员姚文元同志出席了宴会。
    陪同阿尔巴尼亚同志来上海访问的中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声同志，中国人民解放军驻上海部队负责人刘文学、陈士法、周仁杰、姬应伍等同志也出席了宴会。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利同志应邀出席了宴会。
    在充满兄弟般的革命战斗情谊的宴会上，巴卢库同志发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他说，我们在兄弟的中国的一个月，是生活在自己家里，生活在反帝反修反对一切反动派的战友中间。我们在中国到处看到男女老少、人民解放军战士和干部以纯洁的政治感情，朗读毛泽东同志给我们党第五次代表大会贺电中的话：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”这反映了我们两党、两国人民、两国军队的真挚的友谊。我们阿尔巴尼亚人民和军队对中国共产党、中国军队和毛泽东同志怀有同样的感情。我们为有你们这样的同志和战友感到自豪。
    他说，我们党和霍查同志教导人民：以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党、中华人民共和国，在今天的形势下，在明天、后天、将来，都是革命的堡垒，毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党是马克思列宁主义、国际主义的旗手。每一个革命者，真正的马克思列宁主义者，应该保卫中国共产党免受帝国主义和修正主义的侵袭。谁反对中国，攻击中国共产党和毛泽东同志，就会滑到机会主义、修正主义的泥坑中去，就是反马克思列宁主义，就是反革命。
    巴卢库同志说，我们两党在反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，得到了马克思列宁主义者，真正的革命者的有力支持。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，坚定的捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则。以霍查同志为首的我们的党，和中国共产党并肩战斗。他说，马克思列宁主义的事业，革命的事业，把我们两党、两国人民、两国军队紧紧地联结起来了。我们之间的战斗友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是经历过急风暴雨考验的，是永恒的，任何力量和阴谋都破坏不了。也正如毛泽东同志说的“一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”所以，我们友谊的内容，有着共同的目标，有着共同的事业，志同道合。我们是同志和战友。
    巴卢库同志在谈到访问中国的观感时说，我们代表团所有同志认为：毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在向更广阔更深入的阶段发展，并且取得了胜利。这场文化大革命是广泛的深入的群众运动。中国现在确实成了坚持学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大课堂。这场文化大革命提高了革命群众的无产阶级觉悟，使那些反对毛泽东同志革命路线的一小撮可怜虫遭到了打击，把他们抛到垃圾堆里去了。我国工人阶级全心全意支持中国的革命派。他说，中国的工农兵和青年、革命干部，同党、同毛泽东同志血肉相连，这是中国无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃发展的基本特点。通过文化大革命，中国培养着新的革命的一代，把毛泽东思想旗帜一代一代传下去。
    巴卢库同志说，能这样大规模进行文化大革命，表明你们力量的强大，只有这样坚强的党，同人民群众有紧密联系的党，才敢于发动这场文化大革命。让莫斯科修正主义者也来试一试，敢不敢发动象中国这样的无产阶级文化大革命！如果他们敢来试一下，可以断言，在二十四小时内，他们就完蛋；让他们试试看，象我们两国作的，把武器交给人民，也可以断言，二十四小时内，这些武器便在他们的脑袋旁爆炸。他们是不敢的，因为他们害怕人民，因为他们是反人民的集团，他们已经变质了，已经或正在走上资本主义复辟的道路。
    巴卢库同志高度评价毛主席亲手缔造和领导的中国人民解放军。他说，中国人民解放军是一支坚如磐石的军队。这支军队以无产阶级政治挂帅，毛泽东思想是她前进的动力，这是她的最主要的武器，使她成为一支强大的、战无不胜的无产阶级军队。人民解放军对党、对人民忠诚，按照党和毛主席的教导去做，积极参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命，支持革命左派，成为强有力的无产阶级专政的武器。
    王树声同志受我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志、中共中央军委的委托，并代表国防部和中国人民解放军全体指战员，热烈祝贺巴卢库同志和恰科同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团在我国访问成功。
    他说，巴卢库同志和阿尔巴尼亚战友们无限热爱我们的伟大统帅毛主席，高度评价伟大的毛泽东思想，用火一般的热情，诗一样的语言，高度评价我国的无产阶级文化大革命，坚决支持我国亿万革命群众的革命造反行动，高度赞扬他们在文化大革命中所取得的辉煌战果，使我们深为感激。这生动地表明了中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队之间最珍贵、最伟大的无产阶级国际主义的友谊。
    王树声同志说，毛主席说：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”霍查同志说，我们是“风雨同舟”的战友。马克思列宁主义的伟大事业把我们紧紧地连接在一起。让我们永远并肩携手，同全世界革命人民一起，为打倒以美国为首的帝国主义、打倒以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义、打倒各国反动派，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而共同奋斗到底！最后的胜利一定是属于我们的！
    张春桥同志也在宴会上祝酒，祝欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯更加明亮，祝毛主席和霍查同志健康长寿，祝中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队之间的永恒的牢不可破的友谊万古长青。
    人民解放军驻上海部队负责人刘文学同志在宴会开始时讲了话。他代表人民解放军驻上海部队指战员向巴卢库同志和恰科同志，以及阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团全体同志表示最亲切的问候。
