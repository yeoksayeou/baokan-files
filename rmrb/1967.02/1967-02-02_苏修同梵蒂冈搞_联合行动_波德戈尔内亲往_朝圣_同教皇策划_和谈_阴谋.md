According to a report from the New China News Agency on January 31, Vatican City: One of the top leaders of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, Podgorny, visited the Vatican on January 30 and held a lengthy discussion with Pope Paul VI.

Podgorny made his visit to the Pope at a time when the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries were intensifying their conspiracy to "negotiate" a settlement in Vietnam. The Vatican authorities, in a statement issued after the meeting, pointed out that both sides had "discussed issues related to the maintenance of peace." Although the statement did not mention the Vietnam War, it was reported that their talks focused on the Vietnam War. The Pope urged Podgorny to help bring about a peaceful end to the Vietnam War.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, in its effort to betray the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation, has not hesitated to collude with the most reactionary forces in the world and conspire to "negotiate" a settlement. In this regard, the Vatican Pope has formed a joint venture with them. It is reported that Vatican officials believe that, in light of the Pope's recent efforts to end the Vietnam War, Podgorny's visit to the Pope is of great significance.

Shortly before Podgorny's visit to the Vatican, the U.S. imperialist "ambassador" to South Vietnam, Lodge, had just visited the Vatican.

Podgorny and the Pope also discussed the issue of religious life within the Soviet Union. This indicates that they are further pushing for the restoration of capitalism within the country.

Over the past few years, leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique have increasingly frequented the Vatican for "pilgrimages." Khrushchev's son-in-law, the former editor of *Izvestia*, Adzhubei, visited the Vatican in 1963. Last spring, Foreign Minister Gromyko also went to the Vatican to see the Pope. Podgorny is the first Soviet head of state to visit the Pope.

Podgorny also visited Italy for a week and held talks with Italian officials. The communiqué issued after the talks, in the style of the Americans, claimed that the situation in Vietnam "is a serious threat to peace."

    苏修同梵蒂冈搞“联合行动”
    波德戈尔内亲往“朝圣”同教皇策划“和谈”阴谋
    据新华社三十一日讯　梵蒂冈消息：苏联修正主义统治集团大头目之一波德戈尔内，一月三十日访问了梵蒂冈，同教皇保罗六世举行了长时间会谈。
    波德戈尔内是在帝国主义、修正主义和反动派在越南问题上策动“和谈”阴谋进入新的高潮的时候晋见教皇的。梵蒂冈当局在会谈后发表的声明指出，双方在会谈中“讨论了有关维护和平的问题”。尽管声明里没有提到越南战争，但是据报道，他们的会谈集中在越南战争问题上。教皇力促波德戈尔内帮助和平结束越南战争。
    苏修统治集团为了出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争事业，不惜与世界上最反动的势力勾结在一起，策动“和谈”阴谋。在这方面，梵蒂冈教皇更是和他们结成了一个合股公司。据报道，梵蒂冈人士认为，鉴于教皇最近为结束越南战争而作的接触和努力，波德戈尔内对教皇的访问具有重大意义。
    在波德戈尔内访问梵蒂冈之前不久，美帝国主义驻南越“大使”洛奇刚刚访问了梵蒂冈。
    波德戈尔内同教皇还讨论了苏联国内的宗教生活的问题。这说明他们要在国内进一步推行资本主义复辟。
    几年来，苏修集团领导人越来越频繁地到梵蒂冈“朝圣”。赫鲁晓夫的女婿，《消息报》前主编阿朱别依曾在一九六三年访问梵蒂冈。去年春天，外交部长葛罗米柯又到梵蒂冈拜见教皇。波德戈尔内则是第一个访问教皇的苏联国家元首。
    波德戈尔内还对意大利进行了一周的访问，并且同意大利官方举行了会谈。会谈公报仿照美国的腔调，声称越南局势“是对和平的严重威胁”。
