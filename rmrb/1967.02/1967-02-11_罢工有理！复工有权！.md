In the Soviet Embassy, Chinese staff strongly protest the Soviet side's unreasonable refusal to allow workers to return to work and strongly condemn the malicious distortion of the facts by the Soviet revisionist *Pravda* correspondent in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: All Chinese staff working in the Soviet Embassy in China gathered in front of the Soviet Embassy this afternoon to strongly protest the Soviet side's unreasonable refusal to allow Chinese workers to return to work. At the same time, they strongly condemn the malicious distortion of the facts by the Soviet revisionist *Pravda* correspondent in Beijing regarding the Chinese workers' just actions of striking and demanding to return to work.

Chinese workers, in protest against the repeated atrocities of the Soviet revisionist leadership against China, have gone on strike three times since January 27th. After the strikes ended, Chinese workers repeatedly went to the Soviet Embassy to demand to return to work, but were all refused. On the 3rd, Chinese workers, with the exit and entry permits issued by the Soviet Embassy, entered the consular department to negotiate the return to work with the Soviet side. However, the Soviet revisionist *Pravda* correspondent in Beijing reported that the Chinese staff working in the Soviet Embassy had "intruded" into the consular department and "insulted" the diplomats, and that they were "instructed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry," etc. This is pure fabrication. On the 4th, Chinese workers reached an agreement with the Soviet side to continue the negotiations on the 6th. At that time, the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy, Nadashin, promised: "Soviet diplomats keep their word. If we do not negotiate on Monday (the 6th) at 3 PM, you can cut off my head!" However, when the Chinese workers arrived at the Soviet Embassy as scheduled on the 6th, the Soviet staff, using the excuse of "not receiving visitors for three days," created various obstacles and refused to meet with them. The Chinese workers expressed great anger at the Soviet side's despicable behavior.

Today, when the Chinese workers went to the Soviet Embassy to return to work, they were again rudely refused by the Soviet side. The Chinese workers, enraged by the Soviet revisionists' unreasonable actions, shouted in front of the embassy: "Strike is justified! Returning to work is a right!"

The Chinese workers expressed great indignation at the Soviet Embassy's deliberate violation of Chinese laws and the rights of Chinese citizens. They solemnly declared: The strike by Chinese workers to protest against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist leadership is a just action. We have the right to strike and the right to return to work. The Soviet Embassy's political persecution of Chinese workers is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. This account we will definitely settle.

    罢工有理！复工有权！
    在苏使馆工作的我国职工强烈抗议苏方无理拒绝复工，严重抗议苏修《真理报》驻京记者的恶意歪曲报道
    新华社九日讯　在苏联驻中国大使馆工作的全体中国职工，今天下午到苏联大使馆门前，就苏方无理拒绝中国职工复工，提出强烈抗议；同时严重抗议苏修《真理报》驻北京记者对中国职工罢工和要求复工的正义行动所进行的恶意的歪曲报道。
    中国职工为抗议苏修领导集团疯狂反华的多次暴行，自一月二十七日起，连续进行了三次罢工。罢工结束后，中国职工多次到苏联大使馆要求复工，都横遭拒绝。三日，中国职工凭苏联大使馆所发的出入证进入使馆领事部，同苏方进行复工谈判。而苏修《真理报》驻北京记者在报道中竟说什么在苏联大使馆工作的中国工作人员“闯入”领事部，“侮辱”外交官，是“受中国外交部指使”等等。这纯系捏造。四日，中国职工曾和苏方达成了六日继续进行复工谈判的协议。当时苏联大使馆二等秘书那达申提出保证说：“苏联外交官说话是算数的，星期一（六日）下午三点钟如果不谈，你们可割下我的脑袋！”但是当中国职工六日如期来到苏联大使馆时，苏方人员竟借口“三天不会客”，百般刁难，拒绝会见。中国职工对苏方的卑鄙行径表示极大的愤怒。
    今天，中国职工到苏联大使馆复工，又遭苏方横蛮拒绝。被苏修无理行径激怒了的中国职工，在大使馆门前高呼：“罢工有理！”“复工有权！”
    中国职工对苏联驻华大使馆执意破坏中国法律尊严和中国公民的权利表示异常愤慨，他们庄严宣布：中国职工为抗议苏修领导集团法西斯暴行而举行的罢工，是正义的行动。我们罢工有理，复工有权。苏联大使馆对中国工人的政治迫害，是我们绝对不能容忍的，这笔帐我们一定要清算。
