The Soviet revisionists have once again committed a shocking anti-China atrocity. They sent more than a hundred plainclothes agents and thugs to smash and steal six news display windows from our embassy in the Soviet Union. They brutally beat our acting chargé d'affaires and more than thirty diplomats, staff members, and journalists, injuring more than ten people.

	New York Times News Service, Moscow, February 4 — Following the January 25 bloodbath by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against Chinese students in Europe, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has once again incurred a new debt of blood against the Chinese people. On February 3, they blatantly violated international diplomatic conventions and used fascist methods, sending more than 160 or 170 plainclothes agents and thugs to forcibly smash and steal six news photo exhibition display windows from the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union. The Chinese embassy's acting chargé d'affaires, An Zhi Yuan, and 31 other diplomatic and staff members who were protecting the display windows and reasoning with them were all brutally beaten, with three of them sustaining serious injuries. Two of our country's *People's Daily* reporters and Xinhua News Agency reporters who were covering the scene were also severely beaten and injured.

	The six news photo exhibition display windows are all located on the territory of the Chinese embassy. The windows displayed several photos of our country's great leader Chairman Mao and pictures introducing our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as photos of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's January 25 bloodbath against our students in Red Square. The Soviet revisionist leaders are extremely afraid that the Soviet people will accept the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, that the Soviet people will know about their fascist atrocities, see through their traitorous faces of betraying Lenin and betraying Marxism-Leninism, rise up to overthrow them, and rebel against them. Therefore, they regard these six news photo display windows as extremely terrifying floods and beasts, hating them to the core, and are willing to violate international diplomatic conventions and use the most despicable fascist methods.

	At 18:50 on February 3, under the orders of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, more than 160 or 170 Soviet revisionist plainclothes agents and thugs suddenly arrived in cars in front of the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union. The agents, armed with axes and saws, jumped out of the cars and immediately invaded the territory of the Chinese embassy, heading straight for the Chinese embassy's news photo exhibition display windows. Like robbers, they hacked and sawed at the display window supports, forcibly smashing and stealing the six news photo exhibition display windows. They also brutally beat the diplomatic and staff members of our country's embassy who were protecting the great leader Chairman Mao's photos and reasoning with them. Our country's acting chargé d'affaires in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, was struck hard on the head, and after his glasses were knocked off, the Soviet agents raised an axe to chop An Zhi Yuan. Second Secretary Wang Jian Qing bravely rushed forward to block them, but was also beaten to the ground and stomped on, bleeding profusely from the mouth and nose. Commercial Counselor Cai Xin De was knocked to the ground and injured in the chest. Three female staff members of our embassy, Yang Xian Zhen, Jiang Ai Mei, and Tu Duo Lin, were also severely beaten. *People's Daily* reporter Xie Wen Qing, who was covering the scene, was pushed down from a more than one-meter-high step, knocked to the ground, and kicked in the lower body. Xinhua News Agency reporter Ding Xiang Qi was also severely beaten.

	In addition, embassy staff members Cui Wei, Wang Jian Xian, Zhang Guang You, Li Wei Zhong, Wang Gui Hai, Gao Gui, and Yu Yi Wei were all injured.

	The Soviet police responsible for "guarding" the embassy did not stop these agents and thugs who were invading the sovereignty of the Chinese embassy but instead collaborated with another group of agents to block the roads leading to our embassy and participated in the atrocity.

	The Soviet revisionists, fearing that our reporters in Moscow would take photos, not only brutally beat our reporters but also destroyed their cameras and seized their flashlights.

	After the thugs smashed and stole the exhibition display windows of our embassy, they immediately sent people to clean up the scene, attempting to cover up the evidence. The fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist agents and thugs lasted for about half an hour, during which time the embassy's phone lines to the mainland were also cut off.

	After midnight on the 4th, the thugs, under the command of police cars, sneaked back to the embassy four more times, attempting to saw off the remaining half of the display window supports to completely eliminate the evidence, but each time they were driven away in disgrace by our embassy comrades.

	The event created by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is a malicious plot carefully planned by the Soviet revisionist leaders.

	On the morning of the 3rd, the head of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Sudalikov, summoned our country's acting chargé d'affaires in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, and unreasonably demanded that the Chinese embassy immediately dismantle the news photo display windows set up on the territory of the Chinese embassy, remove the photos related to the January 25 incident of Soviet military police and plainclothes agents brutally suppressing Chinese students in Moscow's Red Square, and threatened that if the Chinese embassy did not immediately dismantle them, the Soviet side would take corresponding measures to dismantle the Chinese embassy's news exhibition display windows. An Zhi Yuan, the acting chargé d'affaires, immediately protested against such arrogant and unreasonable demands. Sudalikov, who was in the wrong, did not even wait to hear An Zhi Yuan, the acting chargé d'affaires, finish his speech before turning and walking away. On the 3rd at 18:00, the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union submitted a note to the Soviet Foreign Ministry in response, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists' nonsense and strongly protesting against their arrogant and unreasonable demands. The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has betrayed the Soviet people, is like a gang of bandits. When their extortion failed, they blocked the roads leading to the Chinese embassy at 18:50 on the 3rd, using the cover of night, and taking advantage of the fact that part of the embassy staff had gone to the station to see off Chinese students returning home and had not yet returned to the embassy, they committed this shocking fascist atrocity.

    苏修又一次制造骇人听闻的反华暴行
    派出一百多名便衣特务和暴徒砸坏并劫走我驻苏大使馆的六个新闻橱窗
    野蛮殴打我临时代办等三十多位外交官员、工作人员和记者，打伤十多人
    新华社莫斯科四日电　继一月二十五日苏修统治集团血腥镇压中国留欧学生之后，苏修统治集团又欠下了中国人民一笔新的血债。二月三日，他们公然破坏国际外交惯例，采取了野蛮的法西斯手段，派出便衣特务和暴徒一百六、七十人，强行砸坏并劫走我驻苏联大使馆的六个新闻图片展览橱窗，当场保卫橱窗和同他们说理的中国大使馆临时代办安致远等外交官员和工作人员三十一人，全部遭到残暴殴打，其中三人受重伤。在场采访的我国《人民日报》记者和新华社记者两人，也遭毒打受伤。
    这六个新闻图片展览橱窗全部位于中国大使馆领土上。橱窗里展有好几幅我国人民伟大的领袖毛主席的照片和介绍我国无产阶级文化大革命的图片，以及苏修统治集团一月二十五日在红场血腥镇压我国留欧学生的照片。苏修头目们极端害怕苏联人民接受战无不胜的毛泽东思想，害怕苏联人民知道他们的法西斯暴行，看清他们背叛列宁、背叛马克思列宁主义的叛徒面目，起来革他们的命，造他们的反，因而把这六个新闻图片橱窗看成了万分可怕的洪水猛兽，恨之入骨，不惜破坏国际外交惯例，采用最卑鄙的法西斯手段。
    二月三日十八时五十分，在苏联修正主义统治集团指使下，苏修便衣特务和暴徒一百六、七十人突然乘车来到中国驻苏联大使馆门前，特务们手持斧锯等器械，跳下汽车后，就侵入中国大使馆领土内，直奔中国大使馆的新闻图片展览橱窗，如同强盗一般，在展览橱窗支柱上又砍又锯，强行砸坏并把这六个新闻图片展览橱窗劫走，还野蛮殴打保卫伟大的领袖毛主席照片和为了保卫橱窗同他们说理的我国大使馆外交官员、工作人员。我国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远头部遭到猛击，眼镜被打落后，苏修特务还举起斧头要砍安致远临时代办，二等秘书王荩卿奋勇上去阻挡，也被打倒在地，并被用脚踩踏，当场口鼻流血不止。商务参赞蔡新德被打倒在地，胸部被踩伤。我大使馆女工作人员杨先珍、姜爱梅、涂多琳三人也被毒打。在场采访的《人民日报》记者谢文清被从一米多高的台阶上推下去，被打翻在地，下部被踢伤。新华社记者丁翔起也遭到毒打。
    此外，大使馆工作人员崔嵬、王剑贤、张广友、李维忠、王贵海、高贵、余义维等均被打伤。
    负责“守卫”使馆的苏联警察，对这些侵犯中国大使馆主权的特务暴徒不但不加制止，反而配合另一批特务，封锁了通往我国大使馆的道路，参与暴行。
    苏修作贼心虚，怕我国驻莫斯科记者拍照，不但野蛮毒打我国记者，并且打坏了他们的照相机，抢走了他们的闪光灯。
    暴徒们砸坏并抢走了我国大使馆展览橱窗后，还立刻派人来打扫现场，企图灭迹。苏修特务和暴徒的法西斯暴行，共历时约半小时，当时大使馆同国内的电话也被切断。
    四日零时以后，暴徒们又连继四次在警车指挥下偷偷摸摸来到大使馆，企图把锯剩的半截橱窗支柱连根锯掉，以便彻底消灭罪迹，但每次都在我使馆同志驱赶下狼狈逃窜。
    苏修统治集团制造的这一事件，是苏修头目们有目的、有计划地策划的罪恶阴谋。
    三日上午，苏联外交部远东司司长苏达利柯夫约见我国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远，无理要求中国大使馆立即拆除设置在中国大使馆领土上的新闻图片橱窗，取下有关一月二十五日苏联军警和便衣特务在莫斯科红场血腥镇压中国留学生事件的照片，并扬言如果中国大使馆不立即拆除，苏方将采取相应措施，拆除中国大使馆的新闻展览橱窗。安致远临时代办对苏修这种蛮横无理的要求当即提出了抗议。苏达利柯夫理亏心虚，未等听完安致远临时代办的讲话，扭身走开。三日十八时，中国驻苏联大使馆为此向苏联外交部递交照会，痛斥苏修的胡言乱语，并对苏修的蛮横无理要求提出最强烈抗议。背叛苏联人民的苏修领导集团就象一群匪徒一样，讹诈不成，便在三日十八时五十分，把通往中国大使馆的道路封锁起来，利用夜幕，趁我国大使馆部分人员前往车站为回国的中国留学生送行，尚未返回大使馆的时机，制造了这一骇人听闻的法西斯暴行。
