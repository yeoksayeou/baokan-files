The revolutionary rebels in Heilongjiang Province have gained some extremely valuable experiences in the struggle to seize power under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

1. The revolutionary rebels, based on the specific circumstances of the struggle in their locality, clearly reflected the party's policies and united with the principal responsible comrades in the provincial committee who were implementing Chairman Mao's correct line, and with the principal responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army, forming a tripartite alliance to seize power together.

Chairman Mao said, "Policy is the starting point of all practical actions of a revolutionary party and is manifested in the process and outcome of the action." The red rebels in Heilongjiang Province, in their struggle to seize power, strictly followed the thoughts of Mao Zedong and acted in accordance with the party's policies. They did not mechanically copy the experiences of other places in a metaphysical way, but started from the specific circumstances of their own locality and properly handled the extremely important issue of how to deal with cadres. The red rebels in Heilongjiang Province strictly distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and took resolute measures to strike and completely seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line. For those cadres who made general mistakes, they followed Chairman Mao's consistent teachings of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and the policy of "unity-criticism-unity." For the revolutionary cadres who stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they firmly relied on them and fought shoulder to shoulder.

Their relationship with Comrade Pan Fusheng, the first secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, and the principal responsible comrades of the military region, was formed and tested in long-term struggles. Comrade Pan Fusheng, after the Eleventh Plenary Session, examined his mistakes and firmly supported the revolutionary leftists; the revolutionary leftists also consistently supported Comrade Pan Fusheng's revolutionary actions, and together they fought resolutely against the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road and the "88 Brigade" and "Red Guards" who were deceived and manipulated by these power-holders. In this struggle, the principal responsible comrades of the provincial military region firmly stood on the side of Comrade Pan Fusheng, who was implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely suppressed the counter-revolutionary organizations that were counterattacking the revolutionary line. The revolutionary friendship forged between Comrade Pan Fusheng, the principal responsible comrades of the provincial military region, and the comrades of the revolutionary rebels in the life-and-death struggle, naturally led to joint actions when the new situation of seizing power arose. Comrade Pan Fusheng and the principal responsible comrades of the provincial military region took the initiative to meet with the Harbin City Red Rebels United Headquarters to discuss how to seize power; the Red Rebels United Headquarters, when considering the establishment of the "Heilongjiang Province Red Rebels Revolutionary Committee," took the initiative to propose that Comrade Pan Fusheng and Commander Wang Jiadao of the provincial military region participate. On the afternoon of January 30, the three sides held a meeting, drafted the first announcement, and coincidentally, the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine, emphasizing that "when revolutionary leading cadres stand up and, together with the masses, seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, revolutionary mass organizations should support them," and that "indiscriminately opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything is contrary to the class standpoint of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." This shows that the true revolutionary leftists, at the crucial moment of making revolutionary decisions, are the ones who can best understand the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. Our hearts are tightly bound with Chairman Mao's heart.

2. Before seizing the leadership of the provincial committee, the red rebels in Heilongjiang Province first took control of the proletarian revolutionary mouthpieces, the newspaper office, radio station, and the public security bureau, the organ of dictatorship, into the hands of the leftists, to prepare public opinion for the final seizure of the reactionary stronghold (the provincial committee, which was occupied by the handful of power-holders who were taking the capitalist road) and to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, ensuring the smooth progress of the seizure of power.

Chairman Mao said, "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving more than two contradictions, one must use all one's strength to find the principal contradiction. Once the principal contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved." The struggle to seize power from a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. The red rebels in Heilongjiang Province, from the complex struggle of seizing and counter-seizing power, grasped the principal contradiction. We first took control of the *Heilongjiang Daily*, the *Harbin Evening News*, the provincial and municipal radio stations, and the provincial and municipal public security departments in one day on January 12. From then on, the voices of the red rebels appeared in the newspapers and broadcasts. Then, we arrested the leaders of several counter-revolutionary organizations in Harbin City, such as the "Red Flag Army," the "War Preparedness Army," and the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," causing these counter-revolutionary organizations to quickly collapse; at the same time, we publicly held a mass meeting to struggle against the leaders of the "Red Guards," who were the main instigators of the "January 5" incident, and arrested them for trial. Under this revolutionary situation, the most stubborn royalist forces, the "88 Brigade," announced their dissolution. From then on, the situation was fundamentally reversed. The proletarian revolutionary forces were able to hold their heads high, the bourgeois reactionaries dared not raise their heads, the deceived masses quickly awakened, and the masses in an intermediate position leaned towards the leftists, laying the foundation for the overall struggle to seize power.

3. Firmly rely on the leftist forces within the units to be seized, unite the intermediate forces, and resolutely strike at the most stubborn reactionary forces to seize and consolidate power.

Chairman Mao said, "The fundamental cause of the development of things is not external but internal, lying in the contradictions within things." The red rebels in Heilongjiang Province believe that relying on the true revolutionary rebels in every unit and every department, combining internal and external forces, is an important factor in achieving victory in the seizure of power. The experience of seizing power in the provincial committee has proven this point, and many other units that have successfully seized power have also proven this point.

The seizure of power in the Harbin City Public Security Bureau was relatively thorough, with power taken over from top to bottom. The basic experience was that the leftist forces within the public security bureau and the external leftist forces formed a powerful united front, completely smashing the obstacles laid by the enemy. At the beginning, the power-holders within the public security bureau who were taking the capitalist road attempted to resist the takeover, but were smashed by the revolutionary rebels; later, they colluded with the external "Red Flag Army," "War Preparedness Army," and "Red Guards" to carry out counter-seizure struggles, but were completely defeated; finally, they attempted to use their mysterious public security business to force the revolutionary youngsters to retreat, but were overcome by the leftists within the public security bureau. The people within the public security bureau who were temporarily deceived also relied on the revolutionary leftists within to mobilize the masses, exposing the black headquarters of the counter-seizure struggle, and bringing out the big and small leaders who committed various crimes one by one, making the masses and revolutionary cadres who were willing to revolution all unite around the revolutionary takeover committee. In this way, they stood firm, consolidated their positions, and laid a solid mass foundation for establishing a completely new public security work order. The experience of the commercial system's takeover was also good.

4. The fundamental experience of the seizure of power struggle is that Mao Zedong Thought armed the leftist forces, and the leftist forces used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the seizure of power struggle.

Chairman Mao said, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing and consolidating power." From the beginning of our seizure of power struggle, we conducted an in-depth discussion on the necessity and importance of the seizure of power under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We clarified various non-proletarian thoughts and confused ideas on the issue of seizing power and unified our understanding.

We believe that if one only acknowledges the existence of class struggle in the socialist period and does not acknowledge the sharp and complex struggle to seize power in the socialist period, one cannot be a Red Guard of Mao Zedong Thought and a good soldier of Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionary forces must timely seize back the power from the hands of the bourgeois elements and the revisionist elements who have degenerated and changed quality. Otherwise, the socialist state may undergo a peaceful evolution and a complete restoration of capitalism.

Starting from this understanding, the red rebels in Heilongjiang Province carried out the most courageous and resolute seizure of power struggle, showing no mercy, no hesitation, and no fear, with broad and decisive actions. The red rebels, in the seizure of power struggle, sometimes did not eat or sleep for a day and a night, fully demonstrating their determination to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat to the death and their unlimited loyalty and faith in Chairman Mao and the party. The red rebels possess such a high degree of conscious revolutionary action precisely because they are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

At the meeting announcing the establishment of the "Heilongjiang Province Red Rebels Revolutionary Committee," more than ten thousand red rebels decided to study hard the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," and "The Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention" and other articles, to raise their ideological awareness and combat skills, and to build an extremely proletarian and extremely militant red rebel army. The red rebels issued a thunderous declaration: "Thousands of pages of history, let us red rebels rewrite! Ten thousand years of plans, let us red rebels arrange!"

"We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world."

    新华社哈尔滨九日电　黑龙江省红色造反者夺权斗争的基本经验（此文系参加夺权斗争的红色造反者的领导同志共同研究写成）全文如下：
    在无产阶级专政条件下夺权斗争，是个崭新课题。黑龙江省的革命造反派，在这场斗争中，取得一些极有价值的经验。
    一、革命造反派，根据当地的斗争具体情况，鲜明的体现了党的方针政策，团结省委内执行毛主席正确路线的主要负责人，同人民解放军的主要负责人，三位一体，联合夺权。
    毛主席说：“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿。”黑龙江省的红色造反者，在夺权斗争中不折不扣地照毛泽东思想办事，按照党的方针政策办事。他们不是形而上学地机械照抄外地经验，而是从本地具体情况出发，妥善地处理了如何对待干部这个极为重要的问题。黑龙江省红色造反者严格区分敌友我的界限，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，采取坚决打击、彻底夺权的措施，而对那些犯有一般错误的干部，则采取毛主席一贯教导的“惩前毖后、治病救人”和团结——批评——团结的方针政策。对站在毛主席革命路线一边的革命干部，则坚决依靠，并肩战斗。
    他们同黑龙江省委第一书记潘复生同志和军区负责人联合战斗的关系，是在长期斗争中考验和形成的。潘复生同志，从十一中全会之后，就检查了错误，坚定支持革命左派；革命左派，也一贯地支持潘复生同志的革命行动，双方一起同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和受这些当权派所蒙蔽操纵的八八团、赤卫队，进行了坚决的斗争。在这场斗争中，省军区的主要负责人坚定地站在执行毛主席革命路线的潘复生同志一边，坚决镇压向革命路线反扑的反革命组织。潘复生同志、省军区的负责人和革命造反派的同志，在生死与共的战斗中所结下的革命友谊，在新的夺权形势到来之际，出现联合行动，是非常自然的。潘复生同志和省军区负责人，主动找到哈尔滨市红色造反者联合总部研究如何夺权；红色造反者联合总部在考虑成立“黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会”时，主动提出让潘复生同志和省军区司令员汪家道同志参加。一月三十日下午，三方面开会，起草好第一号通告，刚好中央人民广播电台播出《红旗》第三期社论，强调指出“当革命的领导干部起来，同群众一道，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，革命的群众团体应当支持他们”，“不分青红皂白，反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级观点的”。这说明，真正的革命左派，在制定革命决策的重要关头，是最能体会毛泽东思想精神实质的，我们的心和毛主席的心是紧紧贴在一起的。
    二、在夺取省委的领导大权之前，首先把无产阶级革命的喉舌报社、电台和专政机关公安局，掌握在左派手里，为最后夺取反动的核心堡垒（被一小撮走资本主义道路当权派盘踞的省委）作好舆论准备，坚决镇压反革命，保证夺权斗争的顺利进行。
    毛主席说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”向一小撮反革命修正主义分子夺权，是一场极其尖锐而复杂的阶级斗争。黑龙江省红色造反者从纷纭复杂的夺权与反夺权斗争中，抓到了主要矛盾。我们首先在一月十二日，就把《黑龙江日报》、《哈尔滨晚报》，省、市电台和省、市公安部门在一天中接管了。从此，在报纸上和广播中，出现红色造反者的声音。接着，又把哈尔滨市的几个反革命组织“红旗军”、“战备军”和所谓“荣复军”的头子抓进监狱，使这些反革命组织迅速土崩瓦解；与此同时，还大张旗鼓地把一手制造“一二·五”事件的赤卫队头子，开群众大会进行斗争，逮捕法办。在这种革命形势的逼迫之下，使最顽固的保皇势力八八团宣布解散。从此，从根本上扭转了形势，无产阶级革命派扬眉吐气，资产阶级反动派不敢抬头，受蒙蔽的群众迅速觉醒，站在中间状态的群众向左派靠拢，为全面夺权斗争打下了基础。
    三、坚定地依靠被夺权单位内部的左派力量，团结中间力量，坚决打击最顽固的反动力量，来夺取政权，巩固政权。
    毛主席说：“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性。”黑龙江省的红色造反者认为，依靠每个单位、每个部门的真正的革命造反派，内外结合，是取得夺权胜利的重要因素。省委的夺权经验证实了这点，下面许多单位，凡是夺权夺得好的，也证实了这点。
    哈尔滨市公安局夺权比较彻底，自上而下，接管了实权。其基本经验，就是靠公安局内部的左派力量和外部的左派力量，结成强大的联合阵线，把敌人布下的层层障碍，全部摧垮了。开始，公安局内那一些走资本主义道路的当权派企图抗拒接管，被革命造反派粉碎了；后来，他们勾结外部的“红旗军”、“战备军”和“赤卫队”来搞反夺权斗争，也被彻底击溃了；最后，他们企图用那套神秘的公安业务来逼迫革命小将们退却，也靠公安局内部的左派起来战胜了。公安局内部暂时受蒙蔽的人，同样靠内部革命左派自己发动群众，大揭反夺权的黑司令部，把犯有各种罪行的大小头目一个个揪了出来，使那些愿意革命的群众、革命干部，都团结在革命接管委员会的周围。这样，就站住了脚跟，巩固了阵地，为建立一套崭新的公安工作秩序，奠定下牢固的群众基础。商业系统的接管工作比较好，其经验也是这样。 
    四、夺权斗争的根本经验，归结到一点，就是，毛泽东思想武装了左派队伍，左派队伍运用毛泽东思想指导了夺权斗争。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”我们一开始夺权斗争，便对无产阶级专政条件下夺权斗争的必要性和重要性，进行了深入讨论。澄清了在夺权问题上的种种非无产阶级思想和糊涂观念，统一了认识。
    我们认为，只承认社会主义时期存在着阶级斗争，不承认社会主义时期尖锐复杂的夺权斗争，就不能当一个毛泽东思想红卫兵和毛主席的好战士。无产阶级革命派必须及时地从资产阶级分子和蜕化变质的修正主义分子手里夺回政权。否则，社会主义江山就有可能和平演变，出现资本主义的全面复辟。
    从这个认识出发，黑龙江省的红色造反者进行了最勇敢最坚决的夺权斗争，毫不留情，毫不客气，毫不怯手，大刀阔斧，机智果断。红色造反者在夺权斗争中，有时一天一夜不吃不睡，充分体现了誓死保卫无产阶级专政的决心，充分体现了对毛主席对党无限的忠诚和信仰。红色造反者所以具有如此高度的自觉革命行动，就是因为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的结果。
    在“黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会”宣告成立的大会上，十多万红色造反者决心努力学好“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》等文章，提高思想觉悟，提高斗争艺术，建设一支非常无产阶级化非常战斗化的红色造反大军。红色造反者发出震撼山河的豪言壮语：“千篇青史，有我们红色造反者重写！万年大计，让我们红色造反者安排！”
    “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”
