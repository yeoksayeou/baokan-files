Members of the Australian and New Zealand University Student Tour Group Share Their Impressions of Visiting China
Mao Zedong's Leadership is the Fundamental Guarantee of China's Achievements

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong - "Only by following Chairman Mao can we make progress!" said Tanbu'er, a student from the University of Sydney in Australia, as he reflected on his 25-day visit to China in Hong Kong.

Tanbu'er is a member of the Australian and New Zealand University Student Tour Group. The last batch of members of this tour group arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the 13th. As they walked across the Shenzhen Bridge, Tanbu'er and many of his classmates wore shiny Chairman Mao badges on their chests, red armbands of the Red Guards, and held high a large red flag with "Red Guards" written on it, looking spirited.

Tanbu'er said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the evening of the 13th, "The biggest gain I had in China is seeing with my own eyes how the Chinese people love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China; seeing with my own eyes how Mao Zedong Thought is grasped and applied by the broad masses in their actual lives, exerting tremendous power; seeing with my own eyes the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, where the broad masses criticize high-ranking government officials and post big-character posters. This is the fundamental reason why China has made such great progress in the seventeen years since its liberation." He said, "China will definitely make great progress in the economy in the near future, but this can only be achieved by continuing to advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. I am convinced that the Chinese people will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China must be carried through to the end. In China, 95% of the people support Chairman Mao, while only 5% of the landlords, capitalists, and reactionaries attempt to restore the situation to what it was before 1949. The Cultural Revolution is to block their way and uproot revisionism."

When talking about the Soviet revisionist leadership's instigation of thugs to beat up Chinese students studying in Europe and Chinese diplomatic personnel in the Soviet Union, Tanbu'er clenched his fists and said, "This is a violent act, and I strongly protest against it!"

During his conversation with the reporter, Tanbu'er repeatedly shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and "The East is Red!"

The group leader, Malqing, and some members held a press conference here on the evening of the 13th.

Many members wore shiny Chairman Mao badges on their chests and red armbands of the Red Guards as they attended the press conference.

At the press conference, they sternly refuted some malicious slanderous and provocative questions about China posed by reporters with ulterior motives. The tour group also issued a statement on the 13th on behalf of all its members, expressing their "greatest concern and strongest condemnation of the Soviet revisionists' violent acts of beating up Chinese students."

### 澳大利亚和新西兰大学生旅行团成员谈访华观感  毛主席的领导是中国取得成就的根本保证

    澳大利亚和新西兰大学生旅行团成员谈访华观感
    毛主席的领导是中国取得成就的根本保证
    新华社香港电　“只有跟着毛主席走才能进步！”澳大利亚悉尼大学学生坦布尔在香港回顾他对中国二十五天的访问时这样说。
    坦布尔是澳大利亚和新西兰大学生旅行团的成员，这个旅行团的最后一批团员十三日从广州到达香港。当他们走过深圳桥时，坦布尔和许多同学胸前别上金光闪闪的毛主席像章，臂上戴着红卫兵袖章，高举着写有“红卫兵”的大红旗，精神抖擞。
    坦布尔十三日晚对新华社记者说：“我在中国最大的收获是亲眼看到中国人民无限热爱毛主席，热爱中国共产党；亲眼看到毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握并运用在实际生活中，发挥了巨大的力量；亲眼看到无产阶级专政下的大民主，广大群众向政府高级人员提批评，贴大字报。这是中国解放十七年来之所以取得这样伟大进步的根本原因。”他说，中国不久的将来一定会在经济方面取得巨大进步，“但这只能继续沿着毛主席指引的道路前进才能做得到。我确信中国人民一定照毛主席的指示办事。”
    他说，“中国无产阶级文化大革命是必定要进行到底的。在中国，百分之九十五的人拥护毛主席，只有百分之五的地主、资本家、反动派妄图复辟，把中国拉回到一九四九年前的状况。文化大革命就是挡住他们的路，挖修正主义的根。”
    在谈到苏联修正主义领导集团指使暴徒毒打中国留欧学生和中国驻苏外交人员时，坦布尔紧握拳头说：“这是暴行，我坚决抗议！”
    坦布尔在和记者谈话时多次用中国话高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“东方红！”
    旅行团负责人马尔昆和一些团员十三日晚上还在这里举行了记者招待会。
    许多团员胸前佩戴金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手臂戴着红卫兵袖章出席招待会。
    他们在招待会上严正驳斥了一些别有用心的记者提出的恶意诽谤中国的挑衅性问题。旅行团十三日还以全体成员的名义发表了声明，对苏修毒打中国学生的“暴力行径表示我们最大的关心和强烈的谴责”。
