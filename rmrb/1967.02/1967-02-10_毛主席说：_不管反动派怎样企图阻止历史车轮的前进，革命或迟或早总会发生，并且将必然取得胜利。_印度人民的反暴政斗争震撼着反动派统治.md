Mao said: “No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly triumph.”

The Indian people's struggle against tyranny is shaking the foundations of the reactionary regime.

The five hundred million oppressed and exploited people of India are rising up against the Indian reactionary government and its backers, American imperialism, and modern revisionism. In 1966, one wave after another of unprecedented anti-tyranny and struggle for survival swept across India. As 1967 began, the storm of mass struggle has already risen again. This storm is fiercely shaking the rule of the Indian reactionaries.

	Unprecedented in scale, sweeping the nation

Last year, the broad masses of workers, peasants, students, teachers, government employees, self-employed, and small merchants in India all rose up against the reactionary government of the Indian National Congress. The layers participating in the struggle are becoming increasingly broad. According to incomplete statistics, more than twelve million people participated in the struggle. Almost every week, there was at least one large-scale mass struggle, and almost every month, there were statewide or nationwide strikes, student protests, and market closures. Several waves of struggle, like sudden storms and lightning, swept across the country, inspiring people around the world.

Indian workers are the main force in the struggle. The statewide general strike in Kerala in January and February was unprecedented in scale since India's independence. In February, the textile workers' strike in Mumbai involved two hundred thousand people. In March, the construction workers' strike in the capital, New Delhi, involved one hundred and fifty thousand people. In August and September, several general strikes in Mumbai and West Bengal involved millions of people.

Students were particularly active in the struggle. Especially in the second half of the year, the student movement swept across the country. According to incomplete statistics, there were seven hundred major student struggles in 1964, one thousand three hundred in 1965, and two thousand two hundred by November 1966.

Currently, the struggle of the Indian people is mainly taking place in cities, but it is gradually spreading to the countryside. In some areas, peasants are opening granaries, distributing grain, refusing to pay rent, beating landlords and officials, and opposing the government's seizure of land for capitalist monopolies to set up farms. These struggles are of great significance and foreshadow that the ninety percent of India's five hundred million people who are peasants "will break through all the nets that bind them and rush forward on the road to liberation."

	Down with the Congress Party government!

It is worth noting that the struggle of the Indian people is showing a trend from economic struggle to political struggle.

The broad masses of various strata in India are increasingly recognizing in the struggle that without overthrowing the reactionary rule, the people's lives will absolutely not improve. Therefore, the masses' economic struggles are beginning to combine with political struggles. In the second half of last year, the masses in demonstrations already widely raised slogans such as "against oppression," "against tyranny," and even demanding the resignation of the Congress Party government. In many places, the masses shouted "blood debts must be repaid with blood" during demonstrations. They burned effigies of the Indian Prime Minister, Congress Party Chairman, and government ministers and state chief ministers. Government employees in Uttar Pradesh also shouted "Long live the revolution!" during their strike.

Through their personal experiences in the struggle, the Indian people gradually realize that American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist clique are the backers of the Indian traitorous and reactionary government, the mortal enemies who harm Indian national interests and threaten and infringe upon Indian sovereignty. Without their support, the reactionary rule of the Congress Party government cannot be maintained. They also realize that the socialist China led by Chairman Mao is the true friend of the oppressed and exploited masses of India. In June and July last year, anti-American demonstrations occurred in various major cities in India, with demonstrators shouting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" and "Long live Mao Zedong!"

	Taking the path of violent struggle

The Congress Party government, while singing "non-violence" and "peaceful reform" to sedate the people, is using counter-revolutionary violence to brutally suppress the people's struggles, turning India into a dark police state. According to incomplete statistics, more than eighty thousand people were arrested by the military police in one year, and countless people were beaten to death or injured. The blood of the Indian people is shed on the streets of many towns, in the soil of the countryside, and in the dark prisons.

However, the bloody suppression of the masses by the Indian reactionary government is driving the broad masses to wage broader and more intense struggles. The Indian people are indomitable and unyielding. They attack and burn the offices of the Congress Party and the government, the residences of ministers, and police stations. They attack the cars of ministers and smash prison vans. They often fight with the reactionary military police empty-handed, or armed with bricks and stones, or with bows and arrows, spears, and homemade bombs. They set up barricades. In some places, the masses have even broken into armories or seized guns from the military police. According to very incomplete statistics from Indian newspapers, violent struggle incidents increased from two hundred ninety-two in 1965 to seven hundred in 1966.

It is worth noting that some oppressed Indian ethnic minorities have raised the banner of armed resistance against the Indian reactionary government. The Mizo tribe in Assam has been waging armed struggle since the end of February last year, controlling about seven hundred scattered villages and some military outposts.

The Indian people will encounter many difficulties and twists and turns on the road to struggle. The Indian reactionaries, in collusion with American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, will continue to use the two counter-revolutionary tactics of violent suppression and conspiratorial deception against the Indian people. However, as long as the Indian people have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, are not afraid of difficulties, and go forward unyieldingly, the Indian reactionaries will one day be destroyed.

### 毛主席说：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”  印度人民的反暴政斗争震撼着反动派统治

    毛主席说：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    印度人民的反暴政斗争震撼着反动派统治
    五亿受压迫受剥削的印度人民，正在起来反对印度反动政府及其后台老板美帝国主义和现代修正主义。一九六六年，一场又一场规模空前的反暴政、争生存的斗争风暴席卷印度全国。一九六七年刚来临，群众斗争的风暴又已经掀起。这个风暴猛烈地震撼着印度反动派的统治。
      规模空前　席卷全国
    去年，印度广大工人、农民、学生、教员、政府雇员、自由职业者、小商贩等都起来反对印度国大党反动政府。参加斗争的阶层愈来愈广泛。据不完全统计，参加斗争的群众超过一千二百万。几乎每个星期都发生一两起大规模的群众性斗争，几乎每个月都发生全邦性、全国性的罢工、罢课、罢市。好几次斗争浪潮，象暴风骤雨，迅雷急电，横扫全国，鼓舞了全世界人民。
    印度工人是斗争的主力军。一、二月间喀拉拉邦的全邦性总罢工，规模是印度独立以来空前未有的。孟买市二月间发生的纺织工人大罢工，有二十万人参加。首都新德里三月发生的建筑工人大罢工，有十五万人参加。八九月间孟买和西孟加拉邦的几次总罢工，参加的人数达几百万人。
    学生在斗争中显得特别活跃。特别是下半年，学生运动的浪潮遍及全国。据不完全统计，规模较大的学生斗争，一九六四年是七百起，一九六五年是一千三百起，而一九六六年到十一月初，已发生了两千二百起。
    目前印度人民的斗争主要在城市中进行，但是已经逐步向农村发展。一些地区的农民，开仓分粮，抗缴租税，痛打地主、官吏，反对政府征收土地给垄断资本家办农场。这些斗争具有十分重要的意义，预示着占印度五亿人口百分之九十的农民，“将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。”
        打倒国大党政府！
    值得注意的是，印度人民的斗争，已经出现了从经济斗争向政治斗争发展的趋势。
    印度各阶层广大群众在斗争中日益认识到，不推翻反动统治，人民的生活是绝对不可能改善的。因此，群众的经济斗争开始同政治斗争配合进行。去年下半年，群众在示威时已经普遍提出“反迫害”“反暴政”、以至要国大党政府下台的口号。不少地方群众示威时高呼“血债要用血来还”。他们烧毁了印度总理、国大党主席和政府部长、邦政府首席部长的假人像。北方邦政府雇员在罢工中还曾高呼：“革命万岁！”
    印度人民通过斗争中的切身体会，还逐渐认识到：美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义集团，是印度卖国、反动政府的后台老板，是危害印度民族利益、威胁和侵害印度主权的死敌。没有他们的撑腰，印度国大党政府的反动统治是维持不下去的。他们还认识到，毛主席所领导的社会主义中国才是印度广大被压迫被剥削人民的真正朋友。去年六、七月间，印度各大城市普遍发生了反美示威，示威群众高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”和“毛泽东万岁！”的口号。
      走上暴力斗争的道路
    印度国大党政府，一面高唱“非暴力主义”和“和平改革”去麻醉人民，一面使用反革命暴力疯狂镇压人民斗争，把印度变成了一个黑暗的警察国家。据不完全统计，一年来被军警逮捕的群众达八万多人，被打死打伤的不计其数。印度人民的鲜血洒在许多城镇的街头上，洒在乡村的泥土里，洒在黑暗的监狱中。
    但是印度反动政府对群众的血腥镇压，促使广大人民对它进行更广泛、更激烈的斗争。印度人民是压不倒、打不垮的。他们袭击和焚烧国大党和政府办事处、部长住宅和警察局，袭击部长的汽车，砸烂囚车。他们经常赤手空拳，或者用砖石当武器，或者用弓箭、梭镖、土炸弹武装起来，设置路障，同反动军警搏斗。有的地方的群众还打开武器库，或者从军警手中夺取枪枝。据印度报纸很不完全的统计，暴力斗争事件从一九六五年的二百九十二次增加到一九六六年的七百次。
    值得注意的是，深受压迫的一些印度少数民族，已经举起了武装反抗印度反动政府的大旗。阿萨姆邦的米佐部族从去年二月底实行武装暴动以来，一直坚持武装斗争，现在控制着大约七百个分散的村庄和一些军事据点。
    印度人民在斗争的道路上还会遇到许多困难，许多曲折。同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义勾结的印度反动派，将要继续采取暴力镇压和阴谋欺骗的反革命两手，反对印度人民。但是，印度人民只要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那么印度反动派是总有一天会被消灭的。
