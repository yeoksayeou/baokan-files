French Embassy staff member rammed car into protesting crowd, creating a serious provocation incident
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs summons French Ambassador to lodge a serious protest

It was pointed out: You brutally suppressed our students in Paris and now you are creating new provocations and causing trouble in Beijing. The French Embassy must immediately order the Commercial Counselor and his wife to admit their mistake and apologize to the injured crowd. Otherwise, you will be held responsible for all consequences.

	New China News Agency, February 1st: Just as the revolutionary rebel groups in the capital were protesting in front of the French Embassy in Beijing against the French government's persecution of our students, this afternoon, French Embassy staff created a serious provocation incident. The French Commercial Counselor, Richard, and his wife drove their car recklessly, knocking down several protesters and injuring them.

	The serious provocation by the French Embassy staff has aroused strong indignation among the people of the capital. For this reason, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo summoned the French Ambassador to China, Peyre, this evening to lodge a serious protest, demanding that Richard and his wife admit their mistake and apologize to the injured people.

	At 2:55 PM today, hundreds of protesters in the capital were demonstrating in front of the French Embassy. At this time, the French Commercial Counselor, Richard, and his wife drove their car straight into the crowd, immediately knocking several people several meters away. The protesters were extremely angry at this provocation. People demanded that the counselor get out of the car and apologize to those who were knocked down. Seeing the situation was not in their favor, the counselor's wife turned the car around and tried to escape, but she knocked down several more people in the process. A woman's leg was injured, a young man's thigh was injured, and a child's foot was crushed. People could no longer endure it, stopping her car and demanding that she admit her mistake. The counselor's wife not only refused to admit her mistake but also tore the woman's clothes and tried to hit people with a stick. In this situation, our people continued to shout slogans and read Chairman Mao's quotations, while the counselor's wife acted shamelessly, trying to confuse the facts and escape responsibility.

	During the summoning, Luo Guibo sternly pointed out to Peyre: Today's incident is a serious event where you intentionally disrupted our revolutionary crowd's march. You must take full responsibility for this. You brutally suppressed our students in Paris, and now you are creating new provocations and causing trouble in Beijing against our revolutionary crowd's protest march. For this, the French Embassy should immediately order the Commercial Counselor, Richard, and his wife to admit their mistake and apologize to the injured crowd. Otherwise, all consequences arising from this should be fully borne by you.

    法驻华使馆人员竟驱车撞伤我示威群众制造严重挑衅事件
    我外交部副部长召见法大使提出严重抗议
    指出：你们在巴黎野蛮镇压我国留学生，又在北京进行新的挑衅和破坏。法大使馆应立即责成商务参赞夫妇承认错误，向受伤群众赔礼道歉。否则，应对一切后果负责。
    新华社一日讯　正当首都革命造反派群众在法国驻华大使馆门前示威游行强烈抗议法国当局迫害我留学生的暴行的时候，今天下午法国驻华大使馆人员制造了一件严重的挑衅事件。法国驻华大使馆商务参赞里沙尔和夫人开着汽车横冲直撞，我好几个示威群众被撞倒受伤。
    法国驻华大使馆人员这一严重挑衅，激起首都群众的强烈愤怒。为此，我国外交部副部长罗贵波今晚召见法国驻华大使佩耶，提出严重抗议，要求里沙尔夫妇承认错误，向我受伤人员赔礼道歉。
    今天下午二时五十五分，首都数百名示威群众正在法国驻华大使馆门前示威。这时，法国商务参赞里沙尔夫妇开着汽车向示威队伍直撞过来，当即把好几个人撞到一二米之外。示威群众对于这一挑衅无比愤怒。人们要求这个参赞下车向被撞倒的人赔礼道歉。参赞夫人见势不妙，即掉转车头准备逃跑，继而又撞倒好几个人。一位妇女小腿被撞坏，一位青年大腿受伤，一个小孩脚被压伤。人们忍无可忍，拦住她的车，要她向受伤者承认错误。参赞夫人不但不认错，反而动手把这位妇女的衣服撕碎，并拿起一根木棍企图打人。就在这种情况下，我群众仍然高呼口号，朗读毛主席语录，而参赞夫人却大耍无赖，企图混淆事实真相，逃脱责任。
    罗贵波召见时严正地对佩耶指出：今天发生的事件是你们蓄意破坏我革命群众游行的严重事件。你们必须对此负完全责任。你们在巴黎对我留学生进行了野蛮的镇压，现在你们又在北京对我革命群众的示威游行，进行新的挑衅和破坏。对此，法国大使馆应该立即责成商务参赞里沙尔夫妇承认错误，向受伤群众赔礼道歉。否则，由此而引起的一切后果，应该完全由你们负责。
