PLA soldiers and officers warmly cheer and resolutely respond to the great call of Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee

	Decide to take immediate action to vigorously support spring farming

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated February 22, the eastern wind carries good news, and the three services' soldiers are all joyful. The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Rural People's Communes, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cadres at All Levels" was transmitted to the army, navy, and air force units. Broad masses of soldiers and officers cheered loudly. Soldiers and officers enthusiastically cheered and resolutely responded to the great call of our most beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They decided to take immediate action to vigorously support and assist the rural people's communes in their spring farming work. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, they will make the spring farming work even better!

	Many units' soldiers and officers held meetings and organized discussions today after listening to the broadcast. Soldiers and officers of a certain naval unit said in a discussion that the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Rural People's Communes, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, and Cadres at All Levels" is a thunderclap in the cultural revolution that shakes the heavens. This thunderclap is so timely! So good! The class enemies oppose the revolutionary line of Great Leader Chairman Mao and the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao. We must firmly defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and firmly execute the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." A Five Good Soldier of the artillery regiment of a certain unit in Wuhan, Xue Guangzhu, said: The letter from the Party Central Committee to all rural people's communes, poor and lower-middle peasants, and cadres at all levels conveys the voice of Chairman Mao, greatly boosts the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and greatly dampens the spirits of the class enemies. It is a powerful blow to the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We are the people's army created by Chairman Mao. At any time, we are heart to heart with the masses. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly support rural spring farming, and contribute all our strength to this year's great agricultural harvest.

	The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, and to the people, execute Chairman Mao's instructions most resolutely. Many units' soldiers and officers took immediate action after listening to the broadcast. They organized propaganda teams, carrying the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, rushed to the front lines of spring farming, and actively carried out propaganda activities. Soldiers and officers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery battalion of the air force compiled short and concise cultural programs based on the spirit of the Party Central Committee's letter and performed in the fields and village heads of the local rural areas to propagate to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. More than a thousand officers and soldiers of the garrison on Hainan Island, who are propagating the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" on the front lines of spring farming, immediately propagated Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's new great call to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants after hearing the broadcast today. The leading organ of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region also recorded the radio broadcast and printed the Party Central Committee's letter into leaflets, sending them to units on duty on the seaside and in the mountains, so that soldiers and officers can quickly transmit Chairman Mao's latest instructions to remote villages. Soldiers and officers of the Sixth Company of a certain Yi Ethnic Minority Regiment of the Chengdu Military Region organized a propaganda team to go deep into nearby Yi ethnic minority communities and teams, propagating Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's latest instructions in the fields and farmlands, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the Yi ethnic minority people.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: The People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting force but also a work team and a production team. Broad masses of soldiers and officers firmly remember this teaching. Soldiers and officers of a certain reconnaissance company on the front line in Fujian carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, held quotation boards, and carried red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beating drums and gongs, going to nearby rural areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought while helping with spring farming. In their labor, they studied Chairman Mao's quotations with the poor and lower-middle peasant cadres: "Currently, it is the spring farming season. I hope that all leaders, cadres, and masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve even greater results than last year." The more they worked, the more enthusiastic they became, and the fields were full of vigor.

    解放军指战员热烈欢呼坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的伟大号召
    决心立即行动起来大力支援春耕生产
    据新华社二十二日讯　万里东风传喜信，三军战士齐欢欣。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》一传到陆海空三军各部队，广大指战员欢声雷动。指战员们热烈欢呼、坚决响应最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央发出的伟大号召，决心立即行动起来，大力支持、帮助农村人民公社春耕生产工作，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，把春耕生产搞得好上加好！
    许多部队指战员今天一听完广播，马上举行集会，组织座谈讨论。海军某部指战员在座谈中说，《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》是文化大革命中的一声响彻云霄的春雷。这声春雷响得太及时了！太好了！阶级敌人反对伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线，反对毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，我们就要最最坚定地保卫毛主席的革命路线，就要最最坚定地执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。武汉部队某炮团五好战士薛光住说：党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，传来了毛主席的声音，大长了贫下中农的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子的最有力的打击。我们是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，在任何时候都和人民群众心连心。我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，全心全意支援农村春耕生产，为今年农业大丰收贡献自己的一切力量。
    无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于党、忠于人民的人民解放军广大指战员，对毛主席的指示执行最坚决。许多部队指战员听完广播，立即行动。他们纷纷组织宣传队，带着毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，奔赴春耕生产第一线，积极开展宣传活动。空军某部高炮八连指战员根据党中央的信的精神编成短小精悍的文艺节目，到驻地农村田间、村头演出，向广大贫下中农作宣传。正在春耕生产第一线宣传“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的海南岛驻军一千多名干部战士，今天听到广播后，立即又向广大贫下中农社员宣传毛主席和党中央的新的伟大号召。广州部队某部领导机关还把电台广播录下音来，把党中央的信印成传单，送到海边和高山各分散执勤的部队，让指战员尽快地把毛主席的最新指示传送到偏僻的村寨。成都部队某彝民团六连指战员，组织宣传队深入附近彝族人民聚居的社队，在田间地头向广大贫下中农宣传毛主席和党中央的最新指示，大大鼓舞了彝族人民的生产热情。
    毛主席教导我们：人民解放军既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队。广大指战员牢牢记着这一教导。福建前线某部侦察连的干部战士，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，举着语录牌，拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，到附近农村一边宣传毛泽东思想，一边帮助春耕生产。他们在劳动中，同贫下中农干部一道，认真学习毛主席语录：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”大家越干劲头越足，田间劳动热气腾腾。
