The masses and revolutionary cadres of Wuying Production Brigade in Tongxian County, Beijing suburbs, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have strictly followed Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have used class analysis to correctly identify and treat cadres. The vast majority of revolutionary cadres have demanded of themselves with the spirit of serving the people and humbly accepted the criticisms and supervision of the masses. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have worked together to seize the revolution and promote production, swiftly launching a wave of spring ploughing and production preparations.

After the socialist education movement, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Wuying Production Brigade have, from the very beginning of the Cultural Revolution, emphasized politics and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. On the one hand, they organized the masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's quotations on class and class struggle, correctly handling contradictions among the people, and criticism and self-criticism. They also studied the decisions and relevant policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the other hand, they mobilized the masses to use big debates, big character posters, and other forms to actively criticize cadres. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of prime importance for the revolution." They conducted specific analyses of the brigade party branch secretary, brigade heads, and deputy brigade heads, and other main cadres. Everyone unanimously agreed that most of the main cadres listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely walk the socialist road, strive to consolidate the collective economy, implement the class line of the proletariat, and pay attention to uniting and connecting with the masses. Therefore, these cadres are the ruling class of the proletariat, not the ruling class of the capitalist road. In leading production and work style, although they have shortcomings and errors, these are all internal contradictions among the people. Therefore, such contradictions must be resolved according to Chairman Mao's formula of "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle to resolve contradictions, and thus achieve new unity on a new basis," and cannot be resolved with methods for handling contradictions between the enemy and us. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: The cadres of our brigade have been tested and tempered through the socialist education movement and are first and second-class cadres. We criticize them to help them. After several days of debate, everyone voted by secret ballot to elect the brigade management committee. The original brigade cadres, because they seriously conducted self-criticism, actively worked, and insisted on leading production, gained the trust of the broad masses, and most of them were re-elected.

During the big debates and big character posters, the brigade cadres insisted on leading winter production and preparation work. "All our work cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are unwilling to give up?" The great leader Chairman Mao's teaching gave the brigade cadres great encouragement. They said: "As long as we work for one day, we must strive to serve the people for one day, never slack off, or drop the burden." Initially, some cadres could not accept criticism, thinking it was an attack on themselves. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's quotations on cadre issues, they realized that the masses dared to criticize cadres, which was precisely supervision and help for themselves. As revolutionary cadres, they "must cultivate the democratic style of being good at listening to the masses' opinions."

Chairman Mao said: "If mistakes are made, then they should be corrected, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." The revolutionary cadres of Wuying Production Brigade not only humbly accepted the masses' criticisms but also quickly corrected their mistakes in action. Last year, when this brigade formulated the production plan, it did not mobilize the masses to discuss it well. This year, they adopted the method of the mass line from the bottom up to formulate the production plan. For the sowing area and production increase measures of crops, they followed the needs of the state and the collective, discussed repeatedly with the masses, and then gathered the opinions to draw up a positive and feasible annual agricultural and sideline production plan.

Seeing the brigade cadres practice democracy, listen to opinions, and correct while advancing, the community members consciously abide by labor discipline, obey production commands, actively work and attend, and enthusiastically help cadres come up with ideas and methods.

    群众听毛主席的话正确对待干部  干部虚心接受批评大胆领导春耕
    吴营大队干部和社员同心协力抓革命促生产
    本报讯　北京郊区通县马头公社吴营大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，认真遵照毛主席的干部政策办事。广大贫下中农用阶级分析的方法，正确地识别和对待干部；绝大多数革命干部用为人民服务的精神严格要求自己，虚心接受群众的批评和监督。广大革命群众和革命干部同心协力，狠抓革命，大促生产，迅速掀起备耕和春耕生产的高潮。
    经过社会主义教育运动的吴营大队，广大贫下中农在文化大革命运动中，自始至终突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作。他们一方面组织群众反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争、正确处理人民内部矛盾、批评和自我批评的语录，学习中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定和有关方针政策；一方面深入发动群众，运用大鸣、大放、大字报等形式，积极向干部提出批评意见。大家遵照毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，对大队党支部书记、正副大队长等主要干部，进行具体分析。大家一致认为，大多数主要干部听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路，努力巩固集体经济，执行无产阶级的阶级路线，注意团结和联系群众。所以，这些干部是无产阶级的当权派，不是走资本主义道路的当权派。他们在领导生产和工作作风方面，虽然有缺点错误，都是属于人民内部矛盾。因此，对于这种矛盾，必须按照毛主席提出的“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结”的公式来解决，不能用处理敌我矛盾的方法来解决。许多贫下中农说：我们大队的干部，经过社会主义教育运动的考验和锻炼，是一、二类干部。我们批评他们，是为了帮助他们。经过几天辩论，大家以无记名投票方式选出大队管理委员会。原来的大队干部，由于认真进行自我批评，积极工作，坚持领导生产，取得广大群众信任，大多数人都连选连任。
    在大鸣大放过程中，大队干部始终坚持领导冬季生产和备耕工作。“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”伟大领袖毛主席的这个教导，给大队干部以极大的鼓舞。他们说：“我们只要干一天，就要努力为人民服务一天，绝不松劲，撂挑子。”最初，有的干部听不进批评意见，认为是打击自己，后来学了毛主席有关干部问题的语录，认识到群众敢于批评干部，正是对自己的监督和帮助，作为革命干部，就“必须养成善于听取群众意见的民主作风”。
    毛主席说：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”吴营大队革命干部不但虚心听取群众批评，而且在行动上迅速改正错误。去年，这个大队制定生产计划时，没有很好地发动群众讨论。今年他们制定生产计划，采取自下而上的走群众路线的办法，对农作物的播种面积和增产措施，都按照国家和集体需要，经过群众反复讨论，然后把意见集中起来，订出了一个积极而又切实可行的全年农副业生产计划。
    社员看到大队干部发扬民主，听取意见，边整边改，都自觉地遵守劳动纪律，服从生产指挥，积极出工出勤，并热情地帮助干部出主意，想办法。
