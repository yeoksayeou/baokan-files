The Yugoslav government's tolerance of thugs smashing the news window of our embassy in Yugoslavia and insulting the portrait of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao is a serious political provocation. This event has sparked immense anger among revolutionary masses in the capital. People are filled with righteous indignation and have gathered in front of the Yugoslav embassy in China to protest, strongly condemning the increased anti-China actions of the Tito clique.

From 2 PM until late into the night, revolutionary students, workers, and cadres have been continuously arriving at the gates of the Yugoslav embassy in China to protest and demonstrate. Holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao's quotations, banners, and caricatures, they shouted slogans such as: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism!" "Smash the head of the bastard Tito!" "Down with the Yugoslav revisionist clique!" "Get out, you Yugoslav revisionist bastards!"

The walls and gates of the Yugoslav embassy in China, as well as the ground in front of it, are covered with protest letters and large banners from the revolutionary masses of the capital, strongly condemning the Tito clique. The people sternly warn the Yugoslav revisionist leadership: the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. We will definitely revolt against you! Following the U.S. and Soviet Union in their anti-China stance will not end well for you! The revolutionary people of the world will one day hang you! Revolutionary Red Guards angrily sentenced the traitor Tito's effigy to death and burned it on the spot.

Revolutionary young fighters from various organizations under the Third Command of Beijing drove several propaganda cars in front of the Yugoslav embassy in China, repeatedly broadcasting their strongest protests.

Many revolutionary foreign friends in Beijing also joined the revolutionary rebels of the capital today, marching to the gates of the Yugoslav embassy in China to protest and denounce the despicable anti-China actions of the Tito clique.
