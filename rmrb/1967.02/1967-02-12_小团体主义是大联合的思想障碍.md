Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "To pay attention only to the interests of one's own small group and not to the interests of the whole, and to appear to be acting for the collective good while actually harboring narrow personal interests, is equally corrosive and centrifugal in its effects."

Some individual leaders of revolutionary organizations are keen on promoting small groupism. They expand personal, non-principled differences into antagonisms between revolutionary organizations; they seize on minor flaws in sister organizations to deny their revolutionary essence and main trends, and launch vicious attacks; they become arrogant and self-satisfied with minor achievements, thinking they are the only ones who are right, and acting like kings and emperors, completely disregarding other revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses. In some units, the seizure of power is not carried out through revolutionary great unity, but through small groupism seizing power, using the power they have seized to control sister organizations, while they do whatever they want. This can only cause great harm to the revolutionary cause.

All these manifestations of small groupism reflect the struggle between the two lines, two worldviews, and two ideologies within the revolutionary ranks. It seriously hinders the smooth progress of the struggle for great unity and great seizure of power by the revolutionary masses. To achieve great unity, we must thoroughly overthrow small groupism, factionalism, splitism, and sectarianism!

    小团体主义是大联合的思想障碍
    山西“反修兵团”　国祥　隆笳
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”
    有些革命组织的个别领导人，热中于搞小团体主义。他们把一些个人之间的非原则分歧，扩大为革命组织之间的对立；抓住兄弟组织的一些小缺点，否认它的革命主流和本质，大肆攻击；他们有了一点成绩就居功自傲，唯我独尊，称王称霸，根本不把其他革命组织和革命群众放在眼里。在一些单位的夺权，不是实行革命的大联合，而是搞小团体“抓”权，用他们“抓”到的“权”来约束兄弟组织，自己则要怎么干就怎么干。这只能给革命事业造成极大的损失。
    凡此小团体主义的种种表现，是革命队伍内两种思想、两种世界观、两条路线斗争的反映，它严重地阻碍了无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权斗争的顺利进行。要实现大联合，就必须彻底打倒小团体主义、山头主义、分裂主义、宗派主义！
