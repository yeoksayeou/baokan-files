The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's mouthpiece, *Pravda*, published a long and stinking editorial on November 27 last year, viciously attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It also admitted that it felt "greatly distressed and uneasy" about China's Cultural Revolution.

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. The broad masses of revolutionary people and Red Guards, through tenacious struggles, have exposed and overthrown a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and all kinds of monsters and demons, big and small. They have wielded the revolutionary broom to sweep away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that have poisoned the people for many years, uprooted the source of capitalist restoration, and let the brilliant and radiant Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position. The great feat of the Chinese people in eradicating revisionism and preventing capitalist restoration has shaken the world. This has touched the ugly souls of the Soviet revisionist traitors. What is it that they feel "greatly distressed" about? It is that their dream of turning China into a revisionist state subservient to them has been shattered. What is it that they feel "uneasy" about? It is that they fear the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and that the Soviet people, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people and Red Guards in China, will rise up to rebel against them, seize power from them, and shatter their fascist rule.

In this *Pravda* article, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique claims that in order to create the "illusion that the movement (referring to the Cultural Revolution) is a mass movement from below," the Red Guards were "summoned to participate in this movement." This is sheer nonsense! We Red Guards are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have "rushed" out and "fought" our way out in the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. We harbor deep hatred towards a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and all kinds of monsters and demons, big and small, in society. We are determined to rebel against them, overthrow them, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is the common resolve of the Red Guard fighters. The Soviet revisionist traitors call us "summoned," creating the "illusion of a mass movement," which is sheer reactionary logic. We are the loyal Red Guards of Chairman Mao. We not only want to rebel against the class enemies at home and the old forces, but we also want to join the revolutionary people of the world to rebel against imperialism and its running dogs, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and send these clowns of history to their graves together.

In the *Pravda* article, the Soviet revisionist traitors also say: "What is happening in China under the guise of 'cultural revolution' has nothing to do with such a revolution." What do they consider to be a "cultural revolution"? It is "struggling to raise the cultural level of the entire nation."

The fallacy of "cultural enlightenment for all" spread by these traitors is actually advocating that the proletariat does not need its own culture; it only needs to master all the culture of the exploiting classes. According to the logic of the old men in the Kremlin, we should regard all the existing cultures of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, as treasures without distinction or criticism, allowing feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism to spread freely and corrupt the revolutionary masses, preparing the ideological ground for capitalist restoration.

Let me tell the Soviet revisionist traitors, we, the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have long seen through your evil intentions. Since the Cultural Revolution is a revolution, it is a violent action of one class overthrowing another. We must smash the rotten old culture of the exploiting classes to pieces and create a new, fighting culture of the proletariat. We must expose the true faces of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and reveal their counter-revolutionary ugliness. It is no wonder that you are shouting for those overthrown counter-revolutionary revisionists and cursing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Because you are the biggest revisionists in the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the enemy fiercely opposes us, slandering us as utterly worthless, that is even better. That proves not only that we have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great success." The frenzied curses of the Soviet revisionist traitors only prove that our Cultural Revolution is excellent! This further strengthens our resolve to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Gentlemen of *Pravda*, are you not "greatly distressed and uneasy"? We warn you traitors that the things that will make you "thousand times distressed" and "ten thousand times uneasy" are yet to come! In the great year of 1967, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, we will achieve the great unity of the revolutionary masses, launch a power struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, launch a nationwide class struggle, and definitely turn our country into a red, invincible proletarian state. We will also hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the revolutionary people of various countries, sweep away all the harmful elements.

"Ants climbing a locust tree boast of a great country, how easy can it be for a cicada to shake a tree?" Let the Soviet revisionist traitors go on feeling "distressed," "uneasy," cursing, and attacking. The revolutionary people of the world unanimously acclaim: China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent!

专栏：红卫兵谈天下大事

    蚍蜉撼树谈何易
    苏修统治集团的御用工具《真理报》，去年十一月二十七日发表了一篇又长又臭的编辑部文章，恶毒攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命，并且不打自招地说什么对中国的文化大革命“感到十分的痛心和不安”。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的。广大的革命群众和红卫兵小将，经过顽强的斗争，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和大大小小的牛鬼蛇神，统统揪了出来，打翻在地。他们挥起革命的铁扫帚，把多少年来毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯扫进了垃圾堆，铲除了资本主义复辟的祸根，让光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。中国人民根除修正主义、防止资本主义复辟的伟大创举，震撼了全世界。这就触动了苏修叛徒们丑恶的灵魂。他们“十分痛心”的是什么呢？就是他们妄图使中国变成听命于他们的修正主义国家的美梦破灭了。他们感到“不安”的又是什么呢？就是害怕毛泽东思想的传播，害怕苏联人民在中国亿万革命人民和红卫兵小将的革命造反精神的鼓舞下，起来造他们的反，夺他们的权，粉碎他们的法西斯统治。
    苏修统治集团在这篇《真理报》文章里说什么为了造成“运动（指文化大革命）是从下面起来的、群众性的运动的假象”，红卫兵是“被招来参加这一运动”的。真是一派胡言！我们红卫兵是文化大革命的闯将，是在伟大领袖毛主席的指引下，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中“冲”出来的，“杀”出来的！我们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上大大小小的牛鬼蛇神，怀着深仇大恨，我们就是要造他们的反，革他们的命，把文化大革命进行到底。这是我们红卫兵战士的共同决心。苏修叛徒们骂我们是被“招来”的，是为了造成“群众性的运动的假象”，这是地地道道的反动逻辑。我们是毛主席的忠实的红卫兵，我们不但要大造国内阶级敌人的反，大造旧势力的反，而且还要同世界革命人民一道，造帝国主义以及它的帮凶现代修正主义和各国反动派的反，把这些历史舞台上的小丑一起送进坟墓。
    苏修叛徒们在《真理报》文章里，还说：“在‘文化革命’的幌子下在中国发生的事情实际上同这种革命毫无共同之处。”什么才是他们所谓的“文化革命”呢？就是“为提高全国人民的文化水平而斗争”。
    这些叛徒们散布的“全民文化”的谬论，实际上是在鼓吹：无产阶级根本不要自己的文化，只要把一切剥削阶级的文化学到手就行了。按照克里姆林宫的老爷们的逻辑，就是要我们把古今中外的现有文化不加区别、不加批判，统统地奉为至宝，让封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的臭文化自由泛滥，腐蚀革命群众，为资本主义复辟做思想准备。
    老实告诉苏修叛徒们，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派早就看穿了你们的恶毒用心。文化大革命既然是革命，那就是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴力行动。我们就是要把那些腐朽的剥削阶级的旧文化打个稀巴烂，创立无产阶级的崭新的战斗的文化。我们就是要戳穿一小撮反革命修正主义分子的画皮，暴露他们反革命的狰狞面目。你们为那些被打倒的反革命修正主义分子鸣冤叫屈，拚命咒骂中国的无产阶级文化大革命，这并不奇怪，因为你们就是世界上最大的修正主义者。
    毛主席教导我们：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”苏修叛徒们疯狂的咒骂，只能证明我们的文化大革命好得很，好极了！这更加坚定了我们把文化革命进行到底的决心。《真理报》的先生们不是“感到十分的痛心和不安”吗？我们正告你们这些叛徒，使你们“千分痛心”，“万分不安”的事情还在后头呢！在伟大的一九六七年，我们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争，展开全国全面的阶级斗争，一定把我们国家变成红彤彤的铁打的无产阶级江山。我们还要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同各国革命人民一道，把一切害人虫扫除干净。
    “蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”让苏修叛徒们去“痛心”、“不安”、谩骂和攻击吧。全世界革命人民同声欢呼中国的无产阶级文化大革命好得很！
