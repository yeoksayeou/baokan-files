The Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble held its final performance in China at the Shanghai Cultural Revolution Square on the evening of February 21. Representatives of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction, soldiers and officers of the three armed forces stationed in Shanghai, and over ten thousand revolutionary masses attended the performance.

The Albanian comrades sang passionately about the great leader of the world revolutionary people and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and about the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. When the Albanian comrades sang "Praise to the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha" and sang "The Boat Needs a Helm" and "Long Live Chairman Mao" in Chinese, as well as songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations, the entire audience erupted in sustained applause. Shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" and slogans like "Down with American imperialism!" and "Down with the Soviet revisionist leadership!" echoed throughout the square.

After the performance, amidst the resounding song "The Boat Needs a Helm," the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction presented the ensemble with a banner, congratulating them on their successful performances in China.
