Chinese students studying in Iraq, who were brutally beaten by personnel from the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's embassy in Iraq, returned to Guangzhou today with deep indignation against the Soviet revisionist bastards. They were greeted by more than a thousand revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards in Guangzhou. The students received a warm welcome and heartfelt consolation.

The revolutionary workers, cadres, and Red Guards in Guangzhou were overjoyed at the return of the glorious anti-revisionist fighters to their homeland. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao, carrying banners that read, "Strongly Protest the Soviet Revisionists' Heinous Crime of Suppressing Chinese Students," "Down with Brezhnev," "Down with Kosygin," "We Must Demand Blood Compensation from the Soviet Revisionists," and others. Despite the drizzle, they rushed to the airport. As soon as the ten students stepped off the plane, they were surrounded by the welcoming revolutionary masses. The welcoming crowd eagerly gave them their beloved Chairman Mao badges, and the Red Guards put red armbands on them. Everyone shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

In the waiting lounge, the welcoming crowd held a get-together for the anti-revisionist fighters. Li Pengwang, a representative of the ten students, strongly denounced the Soviet revisionist bastards in his speech and expressed their determination to actively participate in the great proletarian cultural revolution upon their return to the motherland. The Chinese students in Iraq departed at midnight on the 29th.

The Chinese students studying in Europe, who were brutally suppressed by Soviet revisionist military police and plainclothes agents, heard on their way back to the country that Chinese students in Iraq had also been savagely beaten by Soviet revisionist thugs at the Soviet embassy in Iraq. They were even more outraged and immediately sent a telegram to the Chinese students in Iraq, expressing their most resolute support for their revolutionary actions and their strongest protest against the new crimes of the Soviet revisionists. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Dear Comrades,

When we heard on our way back to the country that you were beaten by Soviet revisionist fascist thugs at the Soviet embassy in Iraq for protesting the fascist atrocities of January 25, our lungs were about to burst with anger. The blood on Red Square has not dried, and now you have shed your blood in Iraq. The Soviet revisionist bastards have committed heinous crimes against us. We strongly protest against these bastards and resolutely support your revolutionary actions.

The Soviet revisionist bastards dare to defy the world and stubbornly oppose the great seven hundred million Chinese people and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are truly audacious and foolish. Brezhnev and Kosygin, you bastards, listen up: the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. If you dare to touch a hair on our bodies, we will smash your dog heads. We will definitely create a great upheaval against you and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate revisionism from the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the historical wheel, revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious."

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will be victorious! Modern revisionism will be defeated! A new world bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be established!

Down with Soviet modern revisionism!

Smash the dog heads of Brezhnev and Kosygin!

Workers of the world, unite!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

All Chinese students studying in Europe, January 30

    毛泽东思想必胜！苏联修正主义必败！
    我留伊学生回到广州受到热烈欢迎
    我留欧学生发出声援电坚决支持我留伊学生的革命行动
    新华社广州三十一日电　曾被苏联修正主义统治集团驻伊拉克大使馆人员野蛮殴打的我国留学生一行十人，怀着对苏修混蛋无比愤怒的心情，于今天下午回到广州。他们受到广州一千多革命工人、革命干部和红卫兵的热烈欢迎和热情慰问。
    广州的革命工人、革命干部和红卫兵们对光荣的反修战士回到祖国无比兴奋。他们高举毛主席像，扛着“强烈抗议苏修镇压中国留学生的滔天罪行”、“打倒勃列日涅夫”、“打倒柯西金”、“我们一定要向苏修讨还血债”等巨幅标语，冒着细雨，赶到机场。这十名留学生刚走下飞机，就被欢迎的革命群众团团围住。欢迎群众纷纷把自己心爱的毛主席像章送给他们，红卫兵们把红袖章套在他们的臂上，大家一次又一次地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在候机休息室里，欢迎的人群为反修战士举行了联欢会。这十名留学生的代表李鹏旺在讲话中强烈谴责了苏修混蛋，并且表示他们回到祖国后要积极投身到伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中去。我国留学伊拉克学生是在二十九日零时离开伊拉克的。
    新华社乌兰巴托三十一日电　遭到苏修军警和便衣特务血腥镇压的我国留欧学生，在回国途中听到我国在伊拉克的留学生又遭到苏修驻伊拉克使馆暴徒的野蛮殴打的消息后，更加义愤填膺，立即打电报给我国在伊拉克的留学生，对他们的革命行动表示最坚决的支持，对苏修新罪行提出最强烈的抗议。电报全文如下：敬爱的战友们：
    当我们在回国途中听到你们由于抗议一月二十五日苏修的法西斯暴行，在苏联驻伊拉克使馆遭到了苏修法西斯暴徒的毒打时，我们的肺都气炸了，我们在红场的血迹未干，在伊拉克又洒下了你们的鲜血，苏修混蛋们对我们犯下了滔天的罪行，我们向这些混蛋们提出最最最最强烈的抗议，我们最最最最坚决地支持你们的革命行动。
    苏修这群王八蛋，竟敢冒天下之大不韪，死心塌地的与伟大的七亿中国人民为敌，与战无不胜的毛泽东思想为敌，真是狗胆包天，不自量力。勃列日涅夫、柯西金王八蛋们，竖起你们的狗耳朵听着：用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民决不是好惹的，你们胆敢动我们身上的一根毫毛，我们就砸烂你们的狗头，我们一定要大造特造你们的反，把修正主义从全世界全部、干净、彻底消灭掉。
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想必胜！现代修正主义必败！一个毛泽东思想的阳光普照的红彤彤的新世界一定要建立起来！
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    砸烂勃列日涅夫、柯西金的狗头！
    全世界无产者联合起来！
    无产阶级革命造反精神万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                    全体留欧学生一月三十日
