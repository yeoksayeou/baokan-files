The South Vietnamese Liberation Army in Xining Province has shattered the enemy's "sweeping" operations. In fierce battles lasting half a month, they annihilated more than a thousand American soldiers.

According to a broadcast by the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio, the armed forces of Xining Province in South Vietnam have demonstrated the immense power of people's war. In the first half of February, they launched continuous and courageous attacks, smashing the second major "sweeping" operation launched by the U.S. aggressors in Xining Province since the dry season. They completely annihilated six companies, two platoons, and one squad of U.S. aggressor forces, as well as one platoon of South Korean puppet troops, totaling more than a thousand U.S. aggressors. They also destroyed or damaged 69 tanks and armored amphibious vehicles, shot down or damaged seven helicopters, and seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

After suffering a crushing defeat in the first major "sweeping" operation launched by the U.S. aggressors in Xining Province in November 1966, the U.S. aggressors, in early February this year, rallied eight thousand U.S. troops, under the cover of aircraft, artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles, to launch a "sweeping" operation in the western and northwestern regions of Xining Province, including Lo Ea and Canh Dang. The Xining Province Liberation Army and guerrilla forces, who were well-prepared, immediately launched a fierce counterattack as soon as the U.S. aggressors entered the region, achieving the brilliant victory of annihilating six companies of U.S. troops.

To reverse the situation, the American bandits launched another "sweeping" operation from February 8 to 15 in the regions north of the 20th National Highway and the Sa Mai River in Xining Province. The Liberation Army, seizing the opportunity, launched continuous attacks and once again annihilated a large number of enemy forces. On February 10 alone, the Liberation Army annihilated 100 U.S. aggressors in the Sa Mai River region. That night, the Liberation Army pursued the U.S. troops in the Lo Ea region, annihilating two enemy platoons.

According to a report by the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Army in the provinces of Thua Thien, Quang Tri, and Quang Nam in South Vietnam recently annihilated a large number of U.S. and puppet troops.

On the night of February 6, the Liberation Army in Thua Thien Province launched a fierce attack on the South Dinh shooting range southwest of Hue City. According to preliminary reports, the Liberation Army captured 10 enemy bunkers, killed or wounded more than 100 enemy troops, destroyed 50 armored vehicles and military transport vehicles, and blew up several enemy barracks. The guerrilla forces in this province shot down and damaged two enemy helicopters on February 5 in the southwest of Hue City.

On January 19, the guerrilla forces in Quang Tri Province intercepted an enemy ship convoy on the San Yen River, destroying one landing craft and killing or wounding 40 enemy troops.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army is fighting fiercely, driving the American aggressors to a humiliating defeat. This is an armored vehicle seized by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in a battle.

    南越解放军在西宁省粉碎敌人“扫荡”
    激战半月歼灭美军一千多
    新华社河内十九日电 据越南南方解放电台广播，越南南方西宁省解放武装力量，发挥人民战争的无比威力，在二月份上半月，连续英勇出击，粉碎了美国侵略军从旱季以来对西宁省发动的第二次大“扫荡”，全歼美国侵略军六个连、两个排、一个班和南朝鲜帮凶军一个排，共消灭美国侵略军一千多名，击毁击伤坦克和两栖装甲车六十九辆，击落击伤直升飞机七架，并且缴获大量武器、弹药和军用物资。

    为了挽回败局，美国强盗又在八日到十五日期间，向西宁境内第二十号公路北面地区和沙麦溪地区发动“扫荡”。解放武装力量乘胜连续出击，再次消灭敌人大批有生力量。仅十日，解放武装力量就在沙麦溪地区消灭美国侵略军一百名。当天晚上，解放军又追击罗鹅地区的美军，全歼敌人两个排。
