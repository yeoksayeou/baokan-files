	Capital Revolutionary Rebels Angrily Denounce Soviet Revisionist Fascist Atrocities
	Communiqué of the Rally

	New China News Agency, February 11th: The communiqué of the rally held by the Capital Revolutionary Rebels to angrily denounce and strongly condemn the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, which involved the bloody suppression of Chinese students and the savage beating of Chinese diplomatic representatives and embassy staff, is as follows:

	On February 11, 1967, the Capital Revolutionary Rebels held a rally to angrily denounce and strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody suppression of Chinese students and the savage beating of Chinese diplomatic representatives and embassy staff. The rally firmly supports the solemn statements issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on January 26 and by the Chinese government on February 5, and lodges the strongest and most vehement protest against the Soviet government. The rally expresses the highest respect and warmest greetings to the brave anti-revisionist fighters.

	The rally pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody suppression of Chinese students in front of Lenin and Stalin's tomb once again exposed their traitorous faces of betraying Marxism-Leninism. They organized thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, beating up Chinese diplomatic representatives and embassy staff, which is a serious crime of blatantly violating China's sovereignty and sabotaging Sino-Soviet relations. This is unprecedented in the history of international relations and is absolutely intolerable.

	The rally firmly supports the solemn demands put forward by the Chinese government in its statement, which fully represent the will of 700 million Chinese people. The blood debts owed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique to the Chinese people must be fully repaid! The Soviet government must publicly admit its mistakes, apologize to all the victims in the Chinese Embassy, severely punish all the culprits, restore the six picture windows of the Chinese Embassy, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. The Soviet government must fully accept the demands of the Chinese government; otherwise, the Chinese people will never agree, and the Soviet government must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences that may arise.

	The rally reiterates that the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable by any force. The actions of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique do not represent the broad masses of the Soviet people. Their retrograde and reactionary behavior is merely a last-ditch struggle. We must firmly uphold the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unite the people of the entire country, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Unite with the Soviet people and the people of the world, and carry on the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of all countries to the end, and carry on the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU to the end! The final victory will definitely be ours!

	Chinese students at the rally, with great indignation towards the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, raised their fists and shouted:
	“Soviet revisionism's anti-China actions will not end well!” They enthusiastically shouted: “Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!”

    首都革命造反派愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行
    大会通电
    新华社十一日讯　首都革命造反派愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行大会通电，全文如下：
    一九六七年二月十一日，首都革命造反派举行集会，愤怒声讨和强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压我国留学生、野蛮殴打我国外交代表和使馆工作人员的法西斯暴行。大会坚决拥护我国外交部一月二十六日和我国政府二月五日的严正声明，向苏联政府提出最坚决、最强烈的抗议。大会向英勇的反修战士们表示最崇高的敬意和最亲切的慰问。
    大会指出，苏联修正主义领导集团在列宁斯大林墓前疯狂镇压我国留学生，再一次暴露了他们背叛马克思列宁主义的叛徒嘴脸。他们组织暴徒闯入我国驻苏联大使馆，毒打我国外交代表和使馆工作人员，是公然侵犯我国主权、破坏中苏两国关系的最严重的罪行。这在国际关系史上是罕见的，是绝对不能容忍的。
  大会坚决支持我国政府在声明中提出的严正要求，这些要求完全代表了七亿中国人民的意志。苏联修正主义统治集团对中国人民欠下的笔笔血债，必须彻底偿还！苏联政府必须公开承认错误，向中国大使馆全体被害人员赔礼道歉，严惩全部肇事凶手，恢复中国大使馆的六个图片橱窗，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。苏联政府必须完全接受中国政府的要求，否则，中国人民是绝对不答应的，由此而引起的一切严重后果，苏联政府必须负完全责任。
    大会重申，中苏两国人民的伟大友谊是任何力量都破坏不了的。苏联修正主义统治集团的所作所为，绝不代表广大的苏联人民。他们的倒行逆施，只是一种最后挣扎。我们一定要高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，团结全国人民，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！团结苏联人民和全世界人民，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！最后胜利一定是我们的！（附图片）
    我国留学生在大会上怀着对苏修统治集团的极大愤慨振臂高呼：
  “苏修反华决没有好下场！”热情地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”　新华社记者摄
