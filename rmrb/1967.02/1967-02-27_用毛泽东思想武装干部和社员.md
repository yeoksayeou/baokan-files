The PLA responds swiftly to the call to propagate Party Central's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres, ensuring Mao's voice reaches every corner of the countryside, and actively supports spring plowing with concrete actions.

The cadres and soldiers of a certain air force depot of the Beijing Military Region have resolutely carried out the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, supporting the production brigades in their revolutionary and production efforts. In their work, they emphasize politics, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and inspire the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres, making them spirited and full of vigor, and launching a spring plowing production campaign.

Since last winter, the cadres and soldiers of this depot have followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production," actively helping the production brigades in their area to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution while diligently preparing for spring plowing. After the issuance of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas," all cadres and soldiers were even more elated. They solemnly pledged before the portrait of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, we will resolutely respond to your great call to arms, strongly support and assist in spring plowing production, and strive together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres to achieve victory in spring plowing production!"

Support in a thousand ways, ten thousand ways, the greatest support is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses. The cadres and soldiers of the depot, that very afternoon, carried Chairman Mao's giant portrait, held up the Party Central's letter and Chairman Mao's quotations on red paper, and with drums and gongs, went to the village and fields, repeatedly explaining the Party Central's letter to the masses, studying Chairman Mao's quotations with them, and performing artistic programs. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao dearly and listen to his words. The soldiers read a sentence from Chairman Mao's quotations or the Party Central's letter, and the poor and lower-middle peasants applauded. When the last sentence was read, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed across the fields. In the evening, the propaganda team went to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies. An old peasant said excitedly: "The Party Central's letter says that we poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for grasping revolution and promoting production in the countryside. Chairman Mao trusts us so much, we must make him proud! We poor and lower-middle peasants must be pioneers in grasping revolution and promoting production!"

The soldiers paid great attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the cadres in their propaganda work, helping them raise their consciousness, correct their attitudes, stand tall, and work actively. A brigade leader had made some mistakes and was criticized by the revolutionary masses, causing him to become passive. Political instructor Ye Lijian visited him several times, helping him study Chairman Mao's quotation: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be for the people's interests. If there are mistakes, they must be corrected, this is called being responsible to the people." Sincerely, he told him: The revolutionary masses criticize your mistakes to "cure the sickness and save the patient." As a revolutionary, you should correct your mistakes and not fear criticism. Encourage him to follow Chairman Mao's words, work diligently, and grasp spring plowing production. Chairman Mao's earnest teachings and comrades' sincere words made this brigade leader wake up, determined to make amends in spring plowing production. Other comrades also helped the brigade's cadres with their specific thoughts, helping them study relevant quotations from Chairman Mao with problems in mind, and established the confidence to unite and do a good job in spring plowing. The cadres took active action, which was warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone said: "Cadres who make general mistakes are our class brothers. If they can correct their mistakes and act according to Chairman Mao's words, we will forgive them and support them!"

While propagating, the cadres and soldiers also helped with spring plowing preparations. They worked side by side with the masses, taking on the heaviest tasks. On the hillside, taking soil to fill the land, the ground was frozen and hard, the shovels couldn't dig in, and the hoes couldn't cut through, so the soldiers picked up large hammers, drove steel picks, and pried out the soil block by block. Soldiers Li Chuanshen and driver Lü Xuegong and others swung the hammers, their hands blistered, but they insisted on not changing shifts. Those pushing carts and carrying baskets to transport soil were all running. After the snow, the wind was cold, but everyone took off their cotton clothes and was still sweating. The soldiers' actions deeply moved the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In recent days, the attendance rate of community members has increased several times, almost reaching one hundred percent. Even those in their sixties and seventies are eager to go to work. They said: "Chairman Mao has issued a mobilization order, the PLA is leading the charge, where can we stay? We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, learn well from the PLA, and will not rest until we achieve revolutionary and production victories in spring plowing!"

    解放军闻风而动积极向贫下中农和农村各级干部宣传党中央的信
    让毛主席的声音传遍广大农村  用实际行动大力支援春耕生产
    用毛泽东思想武装干部和社员
    本报讯　北京部队空军某仓库的干部和战士，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席的指示，支援驻地生产队狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们在工作中，大力突出政治，热情宣传毛泽东思想，使广大贫下中农和干部精神振奋，意气风发，掀起了春耕生产热潮。
    去冬以来，这个仓库的干部、战士就遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，积极帮助驻地生产队在开展无产阶级文化大革命运动的同时，努力搞好备耕工作。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发出以后，全体干部、战士更是欢欣鼓舞。他们在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席像前庄严宣誓：毛主席呀毛主席！我们坚决响应您老人家的伟大战斗号召，大力支持、帮助春耕生产工作，和贫下中农、干部在一起，为夺取春耕生产的胜利而奋斗到底！
    千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众是最大的支援。仓库的干部、战士，当天下午就抬着毛主席巨幅画像，举着用大红纸写的党中央的信和毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓来到村头、地头，一遍又一遍地给群众宣讲党中央的信，和群众一起学习毛主席语录，还演唱文艺节目。广大贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。毛主席语录、党中央的信，战士读一句，贫下中农鼓一次掌，最后一句话音没落，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，就响彻田野。晚上，宣传小组又深入到贫下中农家里，组织他们学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策。一位贫农老大爷激动地说：“党中央的信说，咱贫下中农是农村中抓革命、促生产的主力军。毛主席这样信得过咱，咱坚决给他老人家争气！咱贫下中农一定要做抓革命的闯将，促生产的先锋！”
    战士们在宣传工作中十分注意用毛泽东思想教育干部，帮助他们提高觉悟，端正态度，挺起腰杆，积极工作。一个生产队长犯过一些错误，受到革命群众的批评，产生了消极情绪。指导员叶礼珍，几次亲自登门，帮助他学习毛主席语录：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”诚恳地告诉他：革命群众对你的错误进行揭发批判，目的是为了“治病救人”。作为一个革命者，应该知错就改，而不应该害怕批评。鼓励他听毛主席的话，奋发工作，抓好春耕生产。毛主席的谆谆教导，同志的苦口良言，使这位队长猛醒过来，决心在春耕生产中将功补过。其他同志也分别针对队里干部的活思想，逐个帮助他们带着问题学习有关的毛主席语录，树立了团结一致，搞好春耕的信心。干部积极行动起来，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎，大家说：“犯有一般错误的干部，是咱们的阶级兄弟。他们能够痛改前非，按照毛主席的话去做，我们就谅解他们，支持他们！”
    干部、战士一边宣传，一边帮助备耕。他们和群众并肩劳动，专挑重担子。在山坡上取土垫地，地冻土硬，铁锹挖不下，镐头刨不动，战士们就抡起大锤，打钢钎，一块一块地往下撬。战士李传敏、驭手吕学功等同志打大锤，双手磨出了一串血泡，坚持不换人。推车、抬筐运土的，全是一蹓小跑。雪后风寒，可大家脱掉了棉衣，还是汗流浃背。战士们的行动，深深感动了广大贫下中农。近日来，社员出勤率成倍增加，几乎达到百分之百，就连六、七十岁的老大爷，也都争着上工。他们说：“毛主席下达了动员令，解放军带头打冲锋，我们那里还呆得住？！我们坚决响应毛主席的号召，好好向解放军学习，不打响春耕第一炮，不夺取革命、生产双胜利，誓不罢休！”
