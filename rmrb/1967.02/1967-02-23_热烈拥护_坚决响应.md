	Warmly Support and Resolutely Respond

	The helmsman guides the ship across the vast sea, the sun nurtures all living things, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. At every critical moment of the revolution, it is always the great leader Chairman Mao who points out the direction for us. Now, as the spring plowing season approaches and at this crucial moment for ensuring a bumper harvest in 1967, Chairman Mao, in his great wisdom, has once again timely issued a great call to us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. Chairman Mao's words resonate deeply in the hearts of us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us, and we express our warmest support and most resolute response!

	We, several cadres of the commune, declare to our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, that we will definitely follow his teachings, put politics in command, go among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with them, overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We will sincerely accept the criticism and help from the masses, thoroughly correct our shortcomings and mistakes, put down our burdens, and firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," go deep into the production frontline, quickly spread the spirit of the Party Central Committee's letter to every individual, mobilize the masses, and do all the preparatory work for the spring busy season, firing the first shot for spring plowing and production. We will also actively mobilize cadres who have made mistakes to accept criticism and education from the masses, dispel their worries, dare to "cut off their tails" and revolutionize, work actively, make amends for their mistakes, and encourage them to move forward. We must also maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, timely expose the conspiracies and tricks played by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and unqualified cadres who attempt to stage a comeback and create factional disputes to disrupt production, and wage a resolute struggle against them. We will also actively prepare for the commune, production brigade, and production team's three-level cadre meetings, concretely implement the spring plowing and production work, and while doing a good job in the rural cultural revolution, strive for a bumper harvest in 1967!

	Finally, we shout a thousand times, ten thousand times:

	Long live our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao!
	Wish our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao eternal youth and good health!

	Several cadres of Beijing Dongsheng People's Commune

    热烈拥护  坚决响应
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。每当革命的关键时刻，总是伟大领袖毛主席给我们指明航向。现在，正当春耕大忙来临之际，在保证一九六七年农业大丰收的重要关头，毛主席他老人家又及时地向我们广大贫下中农和革命干部发出了伟大号召。毛主席的话，句句说到我们广大贫下中农和革命干部心坎上。这是毛主席对我们最大的关心，我们表示最热烈的拥护！最坚决的响应！
    我们几名公社干部向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席表示：一定遵照他老人家的教导，政治挂帅，到广大贫下中农中去，和贫下中农一起，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。我们一定诚恳接受广大群众的批评和帮助，彻底改正缺点错误，放下包袱，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的革命路线一边。我们决心最坚决地响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，深入生产第一线，把党中央这封信的精神最迅速地宣传到每个群众心里，发动群众，做好春季大忙的一切准备工作，打响春耕生产的第一炮。并且积极动员犯有错误的干部，接受群众批评教育，解除顾虑，勇于脱裤子割尾巴，勇于革命，积极工作，将功补过，鼓励他们前进。我们还要保持高度的革命警惕，及时揭穿地、富、反、坏、右和企图反攻倒算的四不清干部玩弄的挑起宗派纠纷、破坏生产的阴谋诡计，并同他们作坚决的斗争。我们还要积极筹备开好公社、生产大队、生产队的三级干部会议，具体落实春耕生产工作，在搞好农村文化大革命的同时，夺取一九六七年的农业大丰收！
    最后，我们一千次、一万次地高呼：
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    敬祝我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
