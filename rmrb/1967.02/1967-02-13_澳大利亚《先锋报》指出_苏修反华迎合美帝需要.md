The official organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), the "Vanguard," published an article on the 9th emphasizing that the new anti-China incidents deliberately created by the Soviet revisionist leadership are aimed at accommodating the needs of U.S. imperialism.

The article states that the recent anti-China atrocities in Moscow are part of U.S. imperialism's preparations for war against China and are also part of the Soviet revisionists' vile plot to sell out the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to U.S. imperialism.

The article expresses the firm belief that the recent anti-China incidents will further strengthen the unity of the people of all countries and will further expose the ugly faces of the traitorous Soviet revisionist leaders.

The article points out that in the past few years, the series of anti-China activities carried out by the likes of Khrushchev have not in the slightest affected China's international prestige. China has become even stronger. The development of the situation has precisely gone in the opposite direction of the Soviet revisionist leaders' delusions. The result of their betrayal is that they have become infamous in the eyes of the oppressed people of the world.

    澳大利亚《先锋报》指出
    苏修反华迎合美帝需要
    澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》九日发表文章强调指出，苏修领导集团蓄意制造的新反华事件，是为了迎合美帝国主义的需要。
    文章说，最近在莫斯科发生的反华暴行，是美帝国主义对中国进行战争准备的一部分，也是苏修把越南人民的抗美救国斗争出卖给美帝国主义的卑劣阴谋的一部分。
    文章表示深信：最近发生的反华事件，将进一步加强各国人民的团结，将进一步暴露苏修领导集团叛徒们的丑恶嘴脸。
    文章指出，在过去几年中，赫鲁晓夫之流搞的一系列反华活动，丝毫也没有影响中国的国际威望。中国变得更加强大了。事态的发展恰恰走到了苏修领导集团的妄想的反面，他们背信弃义的结果是使自己在世界被压迫人民心目中声名狼藉。
