Any task, to be done well, cannot do without the support of the broad masses. Making revolution is like this, and so is production. The Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory has implemented Chairman Mao's great directive: "Seize the revolution and promote production," and achieved good results. Their main experience is that, based on Mao Zedong Thought, they have united the majority and given full play to the strength of the broad masses.

Believing in the masses and relying on the masses is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching, and it is also a fundamental point distinguishing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Mao Zedong from the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary faction must implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, achieve victory in seizing power from the capitalist-roaders in power, consolidate the fruits of the revolution after seizing power, and lead and organize production well. All these require that we always attach great importance to uniting the majority and mobilizing the broad masses from beginning to end.

The unity between the revolutionary leftists and the broad masses is unity based on Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve this unity, the fundamental thing is to arm the leading cadres of the revolutionary faction and the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The leading cadres of the Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory have, in the course of struggle, constantly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, acting in everything according to Mao Zedong Thought. This has ensured that they can correctly grasp the general direction of the struggle and correctly grasp the Party's policies, thus winning over and uniting the majority. At the same time, they have used Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses, doing ideological work in a targeted manner, and timely solving the ideological problems among the masses. This has powerfully promoted the great liberation of the masses' thinking and the great increase in their awareness. In short, whether before or after seizing power, we must firmly grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works and firmly grasp the ideological revolutionization of the people. Only in this way can the broad revolutionary masses have a clear direction, have true revolutionary unity, and have high initiative in engaging in revolution and production.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses have boundless creative power." With a vast revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we also have a vast production army. By fully mobilizing and giving full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses, Chairman Mao's great directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" can truly be implemented, and we will surely achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    动员广大群众抓革命促生产
    任何一项工作，要想把它办好，都离不开广大群众的支持。闹革命是这样，搞生产也是这样。哈尔滨石油机械配件厂红色造反团贯彻毛主席的伟大指示：“抓革命，促生产”，取得很好的成果。他们的主要经验就是在毛泽东思想的基础上团结了大多数，发挥了广大群众的力量。
    相信群众，依靠群众，这是毛主席的一贯教导，也是毛主席所代表的无产阶级革命路线区别于资产阶级反动路线的一个基本点。无产阶级革命派要贯彻毛主席的革命路线，要取得向走资本主义道路当权派夺权的胜利，要在夺权之后巩固革命的成果，并且很好地领导和组织生产，都必须自始至终地十分重视团结大多数，发动广大群众。
    革命左派同广大群众的团结，是在毛泽东思想基础上的团结。要搞好这个团结，根本的根本就是要用毛泽东思想去武装革命派的领导骨干以及广大群众。哈尔滨石油机械配件厂红色造反团的领导骨干，在斗争实践中不断地活学活用毛主席著作，处处按照毛泽东思想办事，这就保证了他们能够正确地掌握斗争的大方向，能够正确地掌握党的政策，从而争取和团结了大多数。同时他们用毛泽东思想教育群众，有的放矢地进行思想工作，及时地解决群众中的思想问题，这就有力地促进了广大群众的思想大解放，觉悟大提高。总之，在夺权以前也好，在夺权以后也好，都必须狠抓学习毛主席著作，狠抓人的思想革命化。只有如此，广大的革命群众才有明确的方向，才有真正的革命的团结，也才有从事革命和生产的高度积极性。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”我们有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的浩浩荡荡的革命大军，也就有了浩浩荡荡的生产大军。把广大革命群众的革命积极性充分调动起来，发挥出来，那么，毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示就可以真正得到贯彻，我们就一定能够赢得革命、生产双胜利。
