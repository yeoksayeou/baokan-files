In the storm of revolution where the proletarian revolutionary factions are implementing great unity to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels have implemented the Marxist principle of smashing the old state machine on the economic front. They have created the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department, a brand-new organizational form, tightly grasping the economic lifelines of Shanghai in their own hands. This initiative by the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels demonstrates the outstanding revolutionary genius of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will speak? If we do not act, who will act? The urgent task of mass unity, we should actively carry out!" The Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. It is precisely at the critical moment when a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are spreading the counter-revolutionary economic wind, plotting to turn Shanghai into a dead city to oppose Chairman Mao and the Party Central, and to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, that they actively unite to create the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department, launching a powerful counterattack against the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line. It is also at this critical moment that our great leader Chairman Mao personally decides to broadcast to the nation the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Announcement" issued by the Shanghai revolutionary rebel organizations, giving the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels support and courage, making them even more confident and spirited.

The "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department was established on January 8 under the initiative and leadership of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters. It consists of more than 50 representatives from various economic departments and student revolutionary rebels. This fighting collective holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes politics, relies on the masses, implements the combination of work and study, and firmly carries out Chairman Mao's directive of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production." This new organization is fundamentally different from the original Municipal People's Committee's economic leadership structure. It puts politics in command of the economy, rather than being a mere business department. It does not have the bloated and cumbersome institutions of bureaus, offices, sections, and rooms. The entire staff is fewer in number than a single office in some bureaus of the original Municipal People's Committee. They do not spend their days in offices looking at documents, listening to reports, and making phone calls, but often go deep into the masses to solve problems where they arise, working together with the masses. It is under these arduous and in-depth working conditions, in cooperation with the revolutionary rebels, that they organized and mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to successfully repel the counter-revolutionary economic wind, smash the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line, and gradually shoulder the responsibility of commanding and dispatching the vast water and land transportation, market supply, and industrial production of this large commercial city of Shanghai, establishing merits for the people of Shanghai and the nation.

Under the command and dispatch of the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department, ships now come and go like shuttles on the Huangpu River. Trains departing from Shanghai carry passengers and Shanghai's industrial products to various parts of the country. The sound of machines roars non-stop in the factories, and the market is bustling with prosperity.

The "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department is the result of numerous great struggles between the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, emerging from the midst of sword lights and shadows. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." They understand that some reactionaries have the power to counterattack because they hold party power, state power, and economic power, and they bully others with their power. Revolutionary rebels must take control of their own destiny, unite, and seize power! After its establishment on January 8, the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department, with the cooperation of revolutionary rebel organizations such as the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, has successively seized all powers from the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line in many units. Under the assistance of the Command Department, they firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," and the production situation has been completely transformed. Some factories have completed their January production plans ahead of schedule, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the revolutionary rebels who dare to change the heavens and the earth.

The "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department has four compact groups: core, propaganda, liaison, and secretariat. The core group is composed of revolutionary rebel workers from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters and some original municipal bureaus. It analyzes the class struggle situation on the economic front in the current Cultural Revolution at any time and makes decisions. The propaganda group publishes the "Frontline Bulletin," vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought and guiding actual struggles. The liaison group's liaisons go to the grassroots every day to conduct investigations and research, helping revolutionary rebel workers, uniting the majority of revolutionary employees, and together grasping revolution and promoting production. Under their assistance, many units' revolutionary employees have greatly carried forward the revolutionary rebel spirit and achieved one victory after another in revolution and production.

The members of the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department are dispatched by the grassroots units' revolutionary rebels. As Chairman Mao said, we come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. They have always used the method of rectification, using criticism and self-criticism to rectify their thoughts and organizations, to maintain the purity of the team. They "save money for revolution," no one talks about grandeur, everyone is spirited, working day and night.

From the birth of this new thing, the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" Frontline Command Department, it can be seen that as long as the workers and the broad masses of revolutionaries are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the wisdom of the masses is fully utilized, Shanghai's face can be thoroughly transformed, and a brand-new socialist Shanghai under the dictatorship of the proletariat can be established.

    上海革命造反派把经济命脉紧握在自己手中
    新创建的“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部显示威力
    据新华社上海九日电　在无产阶级革命派实行大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的革命风暴中，上海无产阶级革命造反派在经济战线上实行了马克思主义的打碎旧的国家机器的原则，创建了“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部这一崭新的组织形式，把上海的经济命脉紧紧掌握在自己的手里。上海无产阶级革命造反派的这一创举，表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海无产阶级革命造反派卓越的革命天才，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一个新胜利。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”上海无产阶级革命造反派，最听毛主席的话。他们正是在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大刮反革命经济主义黑风，阴谋把上海变成一座死城，以对抗毛主席和党中央，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，积极联合起来创建了“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部，对资产阶级反动路线的新反扑展开了有力的反击。也就在这个关键的时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海革命造反派组织发出的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，给上海无产阶级革命造反派撑了腰，壮了胆，使得他们更加信心百倍，斗志昂扬。
      “抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部，是在上海工人革命造反总司令部的发起和领导下，于一月八日由上海一些经济部门的工人革命造反派推派的代表和学生革命造反派推派的代表共五十多人联合组成的。这个战斗集体高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，依靠群众，实行工学结合，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。这个崭新的组织，同原来的市人委那一套经济领导机构有根本的区别。它以政治统帅经济，而不是一个单纯的业务部门。它也没有什么局、处、科、室等臃肿庞大的机构，全部工作人员还没有原市人委一些局的一个处的人数多。他们不是整天坐在办公室里看公文、听汇报、打电话，而是经常深入到群众中去，那里有问题就到那里去解决，同群众一起商量着办。他们就是在这样艰苦深入工作的情况下，在革命造反派的配合下，组织和动员广大革命群众，胜利地打退了反革命经济主义黑风，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，并逐步肩负起指挥和调度上海这个大工商业城市的庞大的水陆运输、市场供应和工业生产的重担，为上海和全国人民建立了功勋。
    在“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部的指挥调度下，现在黄浦江上船舶来往如梭，从上海发出的一列列火车载运着旅客和上海生产的工业品奔赴祖国各地，工厂里机器声不停地隆隆震响，市场是一片兴旺繁荣的景象。
      “抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部，是上海无产阶级革命造反派同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了无数次大搏斗，从刀光剑影中杀出来的。他们牢牢地记住毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”他们明白，一些反动分子所以有力量进行反扑，就是因为他们手里有党权、政权、财权，他们仗势欺人。革命造反派要掌握自己的命运，就要大联合，就要夺权！“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部于一月八日成立后，许多单位的革命造反派在上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命造反组织的配合下，纷纷从本单位党内走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里夺取了一切大权，并且在指挥部的协助下，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，生产面貌焕然一新，有的工厂提前完成了一月份生产计划，充分显示了革命造反派敢教日月换新天的英雄气概。
      “抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部，设有核心、宣传、联络、秘书四个精干的小组。核心组由上海工人革命造反总司令部和原市属一些局的革命造反派工人组成，它随时分析当前文化大革命中经济战线上的阶级斗争形势，作出决策。宣传组出版了《火线战报》，大力宣传毛泽东思想，指导实际斗争。联络组的联络员，每天下到基层，进行调查研究，帮助革命造反派工人，团结大多数革命职工，一起抓革命，促生产。不少单位的革命职工在他们协助下，大大发扬了革命造反精神，在革命和生产上取得了一个又一个胜利。
    “抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部的成员，是由基层单位革命造反派推派出来的。正如毛主席所说，我们来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。他们一直用整风的方法，用批评和自我批评的方法，整顿思想，整顿组织，以保持队伍的纯洁性。他们“节约闹革命”，谁也不讲排场，大家意气风发，夜以继日地工作。
    从“抓革命，促生产”火线指挥部这个新事物的诞生可以看出，只要用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起工人和广大革命群众，发挥群众的智慧，就一定可以把上海的面貌来一个彻底的改造，建立起无产阶级专政下的崭新的社会主义新上海。
