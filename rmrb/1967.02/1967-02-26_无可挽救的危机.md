The Indian elections have concluded. This election was a farce staged by the Indian reactionaries, with the support of their backers, to maintain the rule of the big bourgeoisie and landlords. The result of the election saw the Indian National Congress suffer its biggest defeat since India's independence. This reflects the fact that the rule of the big bourgeoisie and landlords in India is in a state of grave crisis.

The corrupt and reactionary rule of the Indian National Congress has lost all popular support and has provoked strong resistance from the broad masses of the people. Despite the efforts of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to boost the morale of the Indian National Congress, they could not prevent its defeat in the elections.

As Chairman Mao pointed out, the parliamentary democracy of the West is "nothing but a method for maintaining bourgeois rule. It can never guarantee the freedom and rights of the laboring people." The Indian elections were nothing but a fraud, and they could not truly reflect the will of the people. The contradictions between the Indian reactionary ruling clique and the broad masses of the Indian people are irreconcilable, and class struggle within India will inevitably intensify. The Indian people will ultimately rise up and use revolutionary violence to bury the rule of the Indian reactionaries along with their deceptive bourgeois parliamentary "democracy" once and for all.

    无可挽救的危机
    印度大选结束了。这次大选是印度反动派在它的后台老板支持下，为维持大资产阶级大地主专政而演出的一场丑剧。大选的结果，国大党遭到了印度独立以来最大的失败。这是印度大资产阶级大地主的统治陷入了极大危机的反映。
    国大党的腐朽反动统治已经失尽人心，激起了广大人民的强烈反抗。尽管美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，竭力给国大党打气，仍然挽救不了它在选举中的失败。
    正如毛主席所指出的，西方的议会民主制度，“不过是维护资产阶级专政的一种方法，它绝不能保障劳动人民的自由权利。”印度的大选，不过是一个骗局，它根本不能真正反映人民的意志。印度反动统治集团同广大印度人民之间的矛盾是不可调和的，印度国内的阶级斗争必将进一步激化。印度人民终将要起来运用革命暴力把印度反动派的统治连同它的一套骗人的资产阶级议会“民主”制度彻底埋葬掉。
