Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, Shanghai Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters (Preparatory Committee), and 29 other revolutionary organizations jointly issued an "Urgent Notice" on the 3rd, calling on revolutionary peasants to unite, smash the new plots of the class enemy, seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production!

The "Urgent Notice" first analyzed the current situation in rural areas, pointing out: The revolutionary movement of peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai is flourishing. Over three million peasant revolutionary rebels and revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants have implemented great unity, launched a comprehensive struggle for power, and achieved one victory after another. They are seizing the revolution with one hand and promoting production with the other, and the overall revolutionary production situation in the suburbs is excellent! However, our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle." A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, after the failure of their counter-revolutionary economic sabotage, continue to play new tricks and launch new counterattacks.

The "Urgent Notice" pointed out: A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, some hide in the corners, some bare-chested, spreading poisonous arrows, using all their "eighteen skills," desperately trying to shift the direction of the struggle, trying to cover up their mistakes. These villains maliciously confuse the two types of contradictions, saying, "As long as it's a cadre, they can all be fought," inciting some peasants to direct their struggle against grassroots cadres who have made general mistakes; they instigate grassroots cadres to "lie down and do nothing," "wait for a change of shift," and abandon production management and operational management. These villains use the method of sending in and pulling out to maliciously sow discord among various peasant revolutionary rebel organizations, creating divisions, disintegrating, and disintegrating, and trying to incite the masses to fight among themselves, while they "sit back and watch the tigers fight"; they incite some young peasant revolutionary rebels to leave their struggle and production posts and run to the cities to "rebel." These villains are even more vicious in colluding with local bullies, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and landlords, standing behind them to support them, spreading a "reversal wind," attempting to seize the power of the proletariat. Now, they are using the habit of peasant masses preparing for the Spring Festival to hint at peasants to engage in feudal superstitions, prepare for the New Year, visit relatives and friends, abandon the struggle, and abandon current production. These villains are so reckless and cunning, seriously affecting the development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in some areas, obstructing the struggle for power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, and seriously affecting winter production.

The "Urgent Notice" pointed out: The intentions of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line are extremely sinister. They want to sabotage the struggle for power launched by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat through great unity; they want to sabotage Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," sabotage agricultural production, and attempt to collapse the collective economy of the people's communes. Their ultimate evil purpose is to sabotage the great proletarian cultural revolution and sabotage the great proletarian dictatorship.

For this reason, the "Urgent Notice" appeals to all peasant revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai in four points:

First, all peasant revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary peasants, all revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres who go to the countryside to integrate with revolutionary peasants, must strictly distinguish between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, between bourgeois power-holders and proletarian power-holders, and must not fight indiscriminately, to prevent falling into the enemy's trap. We must concentrate our struggle on a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, on local bullies, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and snakes. We must root them out, fight them down, and fight them to the end. We must be especially vigilant against the "reversal wind" of the class enemy, allowing them to be honest and not allowing them to talk and act recklessly. We must implement proletarian dictatorship over them. In the struggle, we must pay attention to uniting the majority, and for grassroots cadres who have general shortcomings, have made general mistakes, and are willing to correct them, we must adopt the policy of unity-criticism-unity, help them correct their mistakes, distinguish between different degrees, encourage or supervise them to do a good job in production management and operational management, and welcome them to participate in the Cultural Revolution.

Second, all peasant revolutionary rebel organizations must implement and strengthen great unity and great solidarity, launch a comprehensive struggle for power, and seize the power of the bourgeois power-holders. All revolutionary rebels must study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" more diligently, establish the lofty goal of seizing power for the proletariat and for communism, and eliminate all erroneous ideological tendencies. Non-principled differences of opinion should be resolved through equal consultation. We must root out and expel the false leftists, true rightists, and die-hard royalists who have infiltrated the ranks of the revolutionary left.

Third, all peasant revolutionary rebel organizations must unite with the broad revolutionary peasants, resolutely implement the policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and establish and improve two sets of leadership. The spring equinox is approaching, and the agricultural season is very urgent. Currently, the production tasks are very heavy. Large areas of summer crops urgently need strengthening of cultivation management and sufficient fertilizer; agricultural tools, fertilizer, and seeds for spring plowing also need to be prepared immediately. Whether or not we can win the current production battle is a big issue related to achieving a bumper harvest this summer and laying a good foundation for the entire year's harvest. The opportunity must not be missed, and time must not be wasted. We must mobilize and organize all labor power to engage in agricultural production and quickly launch a new high tide of agricultural production!

Fourth, peasant revolutionary rebels and revolutionary peasants must thoroughly reform the "Spring Festival," eliminate feudal superstitious ideas, and resolutely implement the State Council's decision not to take a holiday during the Spring Festival. Those who have stopped production to prepare for the New Year must immediately resume work; those who have gone out to visit relatives and friends must be mobilized to return quickly; production teams that have decided to take a holiday for the New Year must quickly change this decision and insist on doing a good job in production. For those whose thoughts are not clear, we must strengthen education, help them raise their awareness, and mobilize them to actively participate in the Cultural Revolution and actively participate in production labor.

    上海三十一个革命组织发表《紧急通告》
    革命农民联合起来，粉碎阶级敌人新阴谋  抓革命，促生产，夺取革命生产双胜利
    新华社上海四日电　上海工人革命造反总司令部、上海农民革命造反总司令部（筹备会）等三十一个革命组织三日联名发出《紧急通告》，呼吁革命农民联合起来，粉碎阶级敌人的新阴谋，抓革命，促生产，夺取革命生产双胜利！
    《紧急通告》首先分析了当前农村的大好形势，指出：上海郊区革命农民运动正在蓬勃发展。三百多万农民革命造反派和革命的贫下中农，实行大联合，展开了全面的夺权斗争，取得一个又一个胜利。他们一手抓革命，一手抓生产，整个郊区革命生产形势好得很！但是，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在他们一手策划的反革命经济主义的阴谋破产以后，继续玩弄新的花招，实行新的反扑。
    《紧急通告》指出：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，有的躲在暗角里，有的赤膊上阵，大刮阴风，大放毒箭，使尽“十八般武艺”，拚命转移斗争大方向，力保自己蒙混过关。这些坏家伙阴险地混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，胡说“只要是干部都可以斗”，煽动一部分农民把斗争的矛头直接指向犯了一般错误的农村基层干部；他们唆使农村基层干部“躺倒不干”、“等待换班”，放弃生产管理和经营管理。这些坏家伙用打进去、拉出来的办法，恶毒地在农民革命造反派各个组织之间挑拨离间，制造分裂，分化瓦解，竭力挑动群众斗群众，自己“坐山观虎斗”；他们煽动一些青年农民造反派组织的成员，离开自己的斗争和生产岗位，跑到城镇去“造反”。这些坏家伙更毒辣的是同地、富、反、坏串通一气，站在背后撑他们的腰，大刮“翻案风”，妄图夺无产阶级的大权。眼下，他们又利用农民群众准备“过春节”的习惯，暗示农民群众搞封建迷信活动，大办“年货”，走亲访友，放弃斗争，放弃当前生产。这些坏家伙这样胡作非为，使尽奸计，不但严重地影响了某些地区无产阶级文化大革命的开展，阻挠了无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，而且严重地影响了冬季生产。
    《紧急通告》指出：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，用心是非常恶毒的。他们就是要破坏无产阶级革命派实行大联合所开展的全面夺权斗争；就是要破坏毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，破坏农业生产，妄想搞垮人民公社集体经济。他们最终的罪恶目的，就是要破坏伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，破坏伟大的无产阶级专政。
    为此，《紧急通告》向上海市郊区所有农民革命造反派组织和革命农民发出四点呼吁：
    一、一切农民革命造反派组织和革命农民，一切到农村同革命农民相结合的革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，都要严格区分是敌我矛盾还是人民内部矛盾，是资产阶级当权派还是无产阶级当权派，绝不能乱“斗”，防止中敌人的奸计。我们一定要把斗争的矛头集中地指向一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指向地富反坏等牛鬼蛇神。把它们统统揪出来，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。特别要警惕阶级敌人的“翻案风”，只许他们老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动。对他们要实行无产阶级专政。在斗争中要注意团结大多数，对于有一般缺点、犯了一般错误又愿意改正的农村基层干部，要采取团结——批评——团结的方针，帮助他们改正错误，分别不同程度，鼓励或督促他们抓好生产管理和经营管理，欢迎他们参加文化大革命。
    二、各个农民革命造反派组织之间，一定要实行并且加强大联合、大团结，全面展开夺权斗争，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。各革命造反派要加紧学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，树立为无产阶级、为共产主义而夺权的崇高目的，清除一切错误思想倾向。对存在的非原则的意见分歧要通过平等协商的办法加以解决。要把混入革命左派队伍中的假左派、真右派，铁杆保皇分子等揪出来，清除出去。
    三、一切农民革命造反派组织，要团结广大革命农民，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，建立并健全两套班子。立春将至，农时季节十分紧迫。当前，生产任务十分繁重。大面积的夏熟作物，急需加强培植管理和施足肥料；春耕生产的农具、肥料、种子，也急需着手准备。能不能打好当前生产这一仗，是关系到夺取今年夏熟丰收和为全年丰收打好基础的大问题。机不可失，时不再来，绝不可等闲视之。一定要把所有的劳动力动员起来，组织起来，投入农业生产，迅速掀起一个农业生产的新高潮！
    四、农民革命造反派和革命农民，要大革“春节”的命，破除封建迷信思想，坚决执行国务院关于春节不放假的决定。已经停止生产、准备“过年”的人，要立即恢复出勤；已经外出走亲访友的，要动员他们赶快回来；已经准备放假“过年”的生产队，要迅速改变这个决定，坚持搞好生产。对于思想不通的群众，要加强教育，帮助他们提高觉悟，动员他们积极投入文化大革命，积极参加生产劳动。
