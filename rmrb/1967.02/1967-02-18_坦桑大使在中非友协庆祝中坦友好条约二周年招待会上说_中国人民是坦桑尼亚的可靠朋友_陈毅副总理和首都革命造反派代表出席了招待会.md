More than a hundred representatives of revolutionary rebel groups from various sectors in the capital city attended a reception held by the China-Africa Friendship Association this evening, together with Tanzanian friends in Beijing, to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Treaty.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and relevant officials attended the reception. Ding Xilin, Vice Chairman of the China-Africa Friendship Association, and Paul Eliel Mwaluko, Tanzanian Ambassador to China, spoke at the friendly reception, both expressing their wishes for the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania.

Ding Xilin said in his speech that the development of friendly relations between China and Tanzania over the past two years since the signing of the friendship treaty has shown that the treaty serves the common interests of the peoples of the two countries and is beneficial to the unity of Asia and Africa and to the common cause of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism. He praised the victories achieved by the Tanzanian people under the leadership of President Nyerere in maintaining national independence, opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, and building their own country.

Ding Xilin emphasized that the Chinese people firmly support the just actions of the Tanzanian people. He expressed his belief that final victory will surely belong to the Tanzanian people.

Ding Xilin also talked about the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. He said that this cultural revolution will make our country an even stronger and unchangeable socialist country and enable our people to better support the revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world.

Ambassador Paul Eliel Mwaluko, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China, saying that it is built on a solid foundation of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, and is a genuine friendship.

The ambassador said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are implementing correct policies and carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When talking about the series of self-reliant measures recently taken by the Tanzanian government, the ambassador said that after achieving political independence, if there is no economic independence, such independence is not complete independence. He stressed that the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao understand us and are our reliable friends.
