The Soviet revisionists' anti-China crimes are indisputable. The shameless lies of the head of the news department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry cannot withstand the facts.

On February 3, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique dispatched plainclothes agents and thugs to forcibly smash and steal six news display windows of the Chinese Embassy, and brutally beat Chinese embassy diplomatic and staff personnel and Chinese journalists. After this new atrocity, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, guilty and fearful of the world knowing the truth about their new bloody crime, hastily convened a so-called press conference on the afternoon of the 4th. According to reports, the head of the news department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Zamyakin, shamelessly spread lies, distorted facts, and did everything in his power to deny the truth. He also invited so-called "witnesses" to testify, trying every means to justify the new fascist atrocity committed by the Soviet revisionist authorities and to exonerate them from their crimes.

As Chinese journalists who were beaten by Soviet plainclothes thugs on the spot and as witnesses to the entire incident, we know the truth better than anyone else. Therefore, we have the right to tell the world the facts and let the facts refute the various lies of the news department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

Zamyakin said that the news display windows of the Chinese Embassy are "anti-Soviet." What is the real truth? The Chinese Embassy has six news display windows on either side of the entrance. When these six display windows were stolen by the Soviet revisionist authorities' thugs, the pictures displayed were: Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, meeting with the Red Guards; the glorious deeds of 41 young overseas Chinese heroes; the visit of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation to China; Mao Zedong Thought is the fighting weapon of the revolutionary people of the world; Chinese experts abroad and foreign experts in China; and the truth about the January 25 Red Square bloodshed.

Look, how can these pictures be called "anti-Soviet"? If the Red Square bloodshed is "anti-Soviet," then it is not someone else but the Soviet revisionist leadership clique that planned the bloody suppression of Chinese students in front of the great Lenin Mausoleum. Chinese students mourning in front of the Lenin Mausoleum, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing "The Internationale" are all natural revolutionary actions. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique betrayed Lenin's teachings and destroyed the great friendship between the peoples of the two countries. This shameful behavior is not against the Soviet people, is it? The Soviet revisionist authorities deliberately smashed the display windows of our embassy. In short, the Soviet revisionist leadership is afraid of the truth, afraid of the facts, afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, and afraid of the Soviet people seeing their traitorous faces.

Zamyakin said that the news display windows of the Chinese Embassy were "taken down by Soviet citizens themselves." This is a complete fabrication and an insult to the great Soviet people. The facts are that on the morning of February 3, the head of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Sudalikov, met with the acting head of the Chinese Embassy, An Zhi Yuan, and unreasonably demanded that the Chinese Embassy immediately remove the news display windows set up on the territory of the Chinese Embassy, otherwise the Soviet side would take corresponding measures to remove them. After this arrogant and unreasonable demand was firmly rejected by us, at 6:50 PM that afternoon, the new fascist atrocity of Soviet thugs destroying and looting the news display windows of our country's embassy and beating Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff occurred. Who is the organizer of this fascist atrocity? Is it not clear? However, Zamyakin did not dare to touch this real process at the press conference and did not dare to explain that this fascist atrocity occurred after the Soviet Foreign Ministry made an unreasonable demand to the Chinese Embassy that morning.

The broad Soviet people are very interested in the content displayed in the news display windows of the Chinese Embassy. A set of photographs of the Red Square bloodshed was viewed by thousands of people in the six days it was on display. Why did the broad Soviet people not "remove" it in six days, but suddenly "removed" it within less than seven hours after the Soviet authorities issued a threatening notice? On the contrary, the fact is: just as the Soviet revisionist authorities were directing thugs to create a new bloody incident at our embassy, an old Soviet worker near the Yaroslavl Station, while seeing off Chinese students returning home, praised the Chinese revolutionary youth. He said, "We Russian workers support you, you are great." This old worker is most qualified to speak for the Soviet people, and who does the news department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry represent? They can only represent a few buzzing flies that have hit a wall. The Soviet revisionist authorities' attempt to shift the blame for this fascist atrocity to the great Soviet people is in vain.

Zamyakin also said at the press conference that "the Chinese personnel were injured because they cut themselves with broken glass while throwing it at the crowd." This is truly an absurd claim! If the Chinese wanted to start a fight, why would they use broken glass that could cut their own hands? Such a clumsy trick, who but a fool would believe it?

Zamyakin also "formally announced at the press conference that no Soviet citizens had entered the territory of the Chinese Embassy."

Gentlemen, those news display windows were set about two feet inside the fence of the Chinese Embassy. How could your hired thugs complete the "mission" you gave them without entering the territory of the Chinese Embassy? Do you really have some kind of magic trick? The facts are clear, you cannot deny them! On the 4th, when foreign journalists visited the scene, someone on the spot immediately judged, "If you don't go inside the fence, you can't move the display windows."

This news department head even described the news display windows located inside the embassy fence as "picture display windows on the embassy wall," which is so "clever" that it makes one want to vomit. The wall in front of the Chinese Embassy is more than ten meters away from the sidewalk. Setting up pictures on such a distant wall, do you want people to use binoculars to see them?

When "answering questions," Zamyakin even strangely said, "The father and daughter living opposite the Chinese Embassy, Lyapin, saw through the window how the Chinese beat some young people." What is the truth? Anyone who has been to the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union knows that there is only a large garden opposite the Chinese Embassy, and more than a thousand meters away is Moscow State University, with no residents at all. So isn't the "father and daughter living opposite the Chinese Embassy, Lyapin" obviously fabricated? As for saying they "saw through the window..." it is even more absurd.

The Soviet revisionist authorities' crime of directing thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, smashing and stealing news display windows, and beating Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff is indisputable. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao said, "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The Soviet revisionist authorities cannot escape this logic.

### 苏修的反华罪责不容抵赖  苏联外交部新闻司司长的无耻谎言经不起事实的驳斥

    苏修的反华罪责不容抵赖
    苏联外交部新闻司司长的无耻谎言经不起事实的驳斥
    二月三日苏修统治集团出动便衣特务和暴徒，强行砸坏并劫走我驻苏大使馆的六个新闻橱窗，残暴殴打我使馆外交人员、工作人员和我国记者的新的暴行发生后，苏修统治集团作贼心虚，害怕世界人民知道他们这一新的血腥罪行的真相，于是由苏联外交部新闻司匆匆忙忙地在四日下午举行了一个所谓记者招待会。据报道，苏联外交部新闻司司长扎米亚金在记者招待会上大肆散布谎言，颠倒黑白，极尽无耻抵赖之能事，并请了所谓“目睹者”作证，千方百计地为苏修当局制造的新的法西斯暴行进行辩解，妄图为他们开脱罪责。
    中国记者作为当场被苏联便衣暴徒们拳打脚踢的受害者和整个事件的目击者，我们比谁都了解事实的真相。因此，我们有权利把事实告诉全世界，让事实去驳斥苏联外交部新闻司的种种谎言。
    扎米亚金说，中国大使馆的新闻橱窗是“反苏的”。事实真相如何呢？中国大使馆门前左右两端，共有六个新闻橱窗，在橱窗被苏修当局指使的暴徒劫走时，这六个橱窗所展出的图片内容是：中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席接见红卫兵；四十一名华侨小英雄的光荣事迹；苏中友好协会代表团访问中国；毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的战斗武器；中国专家在国外和外国专家在中国以及一月二十五日红场流血事件真相等。
    请看，这些图片怎么能说是“反苏的”呢？如果说红场流血事件是“反苏的”话，那末反苏的不是别人，而正是策划了在伟大的列宁陵墓前血腥镇压中国学生的苏修领导集团。中国学生在列宁陵墓前默哀，读毛主席语录，唱《国际歌》，这是理所当然的革命行动。苏修领导集团背叛列宁的教导、破坏中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，这种可耻的行为不正是反对苏联人民又是什么呢？苏修统治集团蓄意砸毁我大使馆的橱窗，说穿了就是因为苏修领导集团害怕真理、害怕事实，害怕毛泽东思想，害怕苏联人民看清他们的叛徒嘴脸。
    扎米亚金说，中国大使馆的新闻橱窗是“苏联公民自己弄掉的”。这是彻头彻尾的造谣，这是对伟大的苏联人民的污辱。事实经过是二月三日上午，苏联外交部远东司司长苏达利柯夫会见中国大使馆临时代办安致远，无理要求中国大使馆立即拆除设置在中国大使馆领土上的新闻橱窗，否则苏方就要采取相应措施，予以拆除。苏联当局的这种蛮横无理的要求被我严正拒绝后，当日下午六时五十分便发生了苏联暴徒破坏和抢劫我国大使馆新闻橱窗和毒打中国外交代表和工作人员的新的法西斯暴行。谁是这一法西斯暴行的组织者难道还不清楚吗？但是，扎米亚金在记者招待会上根本不敢触及这一真实过程，不敢说明这一法西斯暴行是在当日上午苏联外交部向中国大使馆提出无理要求之后发生的。
    广大苏联人民对中国大使馆的新闻橱窗所展出的内容是怀有极大兴趣的。红场流血事件一组照片在展出的六天中就有几千人前来观看。为什么六天来苏联广大人民没有“拆除”它，而恰恰在苏联外交部发出威胁通知后不到七小时内就忽然把它“拆除”了呢？相反的事实是：正当苏修当局指使暴徒在我使馆制造新的流血事件的时候，一位苏联老工人在雅罗斯拉夫车站附近同为回国的中国留学生送行的中国同志谈话时，热烈称赞中国革命青年。他说：“我们俄罗斯的工人支持你们，你们是好样的”。这位老工人最有资格代表苏联人民说话，而苏联外交部新闻司究竟能够代表谁呢？他们只能代表几个嗡嗡叫的碰壁的苍蝇而已。苏修当局妄图把制造这一法西斯暴行的罪责转嫁到伟大的苏联人民头上，是徒劳的。
    扎米亚金还在记者招待会上说什么，“中国人员流血是因为中国人员在向人群扔碎玻璃时自己划破了手的”。这真是海外奇谈！中国人如果要动手打人的话，为什么偏偏要用能割破自己的手的碎玻璃呢？这种拙劣的手法，除了傻子以外，又有什么人会相信呢？
    扎米亚金在记者招待会上还“正式宣布，苏联人一个也没有到中国使馆的领土上去。”
    先生们，那些新闻橱窗都是设在中国大使馆围栏内约二尺远的地方，你们豢养的打手们如果不进入中国使馆领土，又如何能完成你们交给的“任务”呢？难道你们真有什么高超的魔术吗？事实俱在，你们休想抵赖！四日，当外国记者在参观现场时，就有人当场判断说：“如果不进到围栏里边，橱窗是搬不走的”。
    这位新闻司长还把位于使馆围栏内的新闻橱窗，说成是“使馆墙上的图片橱窗”，真是“聪明”得令人呕吐。中国大使馆前面的墙壁距离行人道还有十多米远，在这么远的墙壁上设置图片，难道要叫人们用望远镜去看吗？
    扎米亚金在“解答问题”时，甚至还离奇地说：“住在中国使馆对面的雷平父女通过窗户看到，中国人是怎样打一些年轻人的”。事实是怎样呢？到过中国驻苏联大使馆的人都很清楚，中国大使馆对面只有一个大花园，一千多米外是莫斯科大学，根本没有什么住户。那么扎米亚金说的“住在中国使馆对面的雷平父女”不是明显的臆造出来的吗？至于说他们“通过窗户看到……”更是无稽之谈。
    苏修当局指使暴徒闯进中国驻苏大使馆，砸毁和劫走新闻橱窗，毒打中国外交代表和工作人员的罪行是抵赖不了的。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”苏修当局是无法逃脱这个逻辑的。
