Spring Colors Fill the Factory

The red rebels of Beijing Guanghua Dyeing Factory, after seizing power, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." With the heroic spirit of "shouldering the world with iron shoulders and embroidering the mountains and rivers with skillful hands," they created one inspiring deed after another and embroidered a vibrant spring scene.

40,000 Meters of Brocade

One morning, Li from the planning department hurried into the workshop. He opened the product registration book and immediately frowned: "Why isn't the brocade in production? Such an urgent task, and it's just left aside?" He quickly walked to the finishing workshop. Seeing that there was no such product there, his heart raced like a high-speed loom. He asked impatiently, "Hey, why isn't the brocade being produced?"

The workers, seeing his anxious expression, all laughed: "Comrade Li, now that we red rebels are in charge, can we still produce according to the old capitalist roaders' methods? The brocade has already been put into storage this morning!"

"Into storage?" Li walked towards the warehouse, half-believing and half-doubting.

As soon as he entered the warehouse, Li saw piles of neatly packaged brocade, which made him both happy and surprised: "Amazing! Such a delicate and difficult product, under the old capitalist roaders' methods, 40,000 meters of brocade would take three days to complete! Now we've done it in one day!" Li's face broke into a smile, and he eagerly asked, "Hey, how did you accomplish this 'monkey king's somersault'?"

"When you truly take charge, you have boundless energy!" A young man proudly said with a smile: "Yesterday, when we heard that this batch of products was for a sister factory and they needed it urgently, everyone volunteered: Let's do it! Let's work together to create a new record and achieve a new level! As soon as the fabric arrived, everyone started working urgently! Everyone operated the machines, stopping and starting them as needed, listening to the machine sounds, watching the operation, running back and forth, sweating profusely..." Saying this, the young man stuck out his tongue: "Hey, Comrade Li! The 'monkey king's somersault' was done like this, ten thousand miles!"

After saying this, he couldn't help but sing, "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we don't say it, who will? If we don't do it, who will?" from Chairman Mao's quotations.

At this moment, the machines ran even faster, and the young man sang even louder.

Victory Reports from the Maintenance Room

In the spacious maintenance room, the red rebels were discussing the maintenance of the "three effects" (three evaporators for concentrating caustic soda) with revolutionary workers and technicians.

These "three effects" are the heart of the factory's production process. In the past, each maintenance required six days. Therefore, maintenance was usually done during the Spring Festival. This year, to grasp the revolution and promote production, the Spring Festival was decided not to be a holiday. A difficult problem was presented to the red rebels: not to maintain would mean facing potential failures by mid-year; to maintain would mean working during the Spring Festival. How to do it?

Facing this dilemma, the red rebels repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created."

Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guide for revolution, the ocean of wisdom, the weapon of struggle, and the guarantee of victory. The more they studied, the brighter their minds became.

At this moment, a vigorous rebel rolled up his sleeves, waved his arms, and shouted loudly: "Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true! Mao Zedong Thought has armed our minds. We have seized power and taken charge, so what miracles can we not create! I suggest we have a 'Monkey King's Rebellion in Heaven,' divide the personnel into three shifts, and complete this maintenance task on Sunday!"

As soon as the words were spoken, they received enthusiastic support from many people; but a capitalist roader sitting in the corner said slowly: "To complete it in one day is not simple, that is a miracle, that is a miracle!"

This was clearly pouring cold water! An old worker's eyes blazed, and he stood up to say: "We red rebels are not simple: Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! You used to use double pay on holidays to stimulate us to work, leading us confusedly down the capitalist road. How could that make us give our all! Now, we are in charge, and Mao Zedong Thought is in command. We smash the old frameworks, and it is completely possible to complete the maintenance in one day!"

After the workers firmly refuted the capitalist roaders, they collectively thought of many good ideas: to ensure manpower, each workshop sent people to support; to avoid fighting unprepared, tools were prepared in advance; the new heater was moved into the workshop, etc.

On Sunday, a maintenance battle began. The workers united as one heart, combining their efforts. Those who pulled pipes pulled, those who lifted chains lifted. Everyone competed with each other, putting their revolutionary spirit into every screw and every part, working sweatily and energetically. When facing difficulties, they recited, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." When tired, they recited, "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous battle (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After a day and a night of intense battle, the giant new heater was installed, and it once again functioned like a heart, continuously supplying a large amount of alkali to the workshop. Completing six days' work in one day is not just a simple number; it wrote a brilliant victory report for the red rebels taking charge and promoting production!

Flowers of Cooperation Bloom

One day, a comrade from the production department of Guanghua Dyeing Factory rushed into the headquarters of the red rebels after a phone call.

"Just in time, you are all here! Just now, Guanghua Weaving Factory called, asking for our help: their factory has more than ten rolls of colored woven fabric that got wet, and now they need to rush them into storage for external transfer, but those capitalist roaders not only shirk their responsibilities but also use this incident to create trouble, trying to strike at the red rebels of the weaving factory. Now, they want to borrow our drying machine to dry the fabric."

At this moment, a capitalist roader present shook his head and said, "This matter needs to be carefully considered! If the processing is not good, the density is not enough, the width is not appropriate, what should we do? Who is responsible?"

"We are responsible!" A leader of the red rebels responded with a thunderous voice: "If the sky falls, we will hold it up! If the earth sinks, we will fill it in! The revolutionary masses across the country are united, and when they encounter difficulties, we must support them!"

The red rebels fighting by the drying machine, upon hearing the news of supporting the sister factory, all rolled up their sleeves and said, "Hurry up and bring it, we will do it!"

To ensure the successful completion of this task, they increased manpower and prepared everything for the battle. As soon as the fabric arrived, everyone quickly connected the fabric ends. In an instant, the drying machine spun rapidly, and the hundreds of meters long fabric flew over the machine like a giant dragon. The red rebels were full of energy, concentrating on the operation. After a tense battle of seconds and minutes, the colored woven fabric was finally dried.

When they joyfully took down the fabric for inspection, they suddenly found that two rolls had insufficient width. What to do? Just at this moment, the slitting workers rushed over upon hearing the news, hugged the fabric, and based on their past practical experience, boldly broke the rules, pulling the slitting machine apart and creatively widening it. Under the great cooperation of the red rebels of the dyeing factory, the weaving factory's fabric was finally processed.

More than ten rolls of wet fabric were sent out intact, and the red rebels of the weaving factory tightly held the hands of the red rebels of the dyeing factory, too excited to speak...

    春色满厂
    红涛
    “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地复慨而慷。”北京光华染厂的红色造反者夺权以后，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以“一副铁肩担世界，一双妙手绣山河”的英雄气概，创造出一个个振奋人心的事迹，织绣出一幅幅色彩绚丽的春天图景……
    四万米格府绸
    一天清晨，计划科的老李匆匆忙忙走进车间，他翻开产品登记本一瞧，顿时眉头结了疙瘩：“咦，格府绸怎么不在生产过程中啊？这么紧急的任务，也撂着不干啦？”他快步向整装车间走去，一见整装车间也没有这种产品，心里急得就象飞速运转的织布机。他气鼓鼓地问道：“喂，格府绸咋不投产？”
    工人们一瞧他那副焦急相，都笑开了：“老李，咱们红色造反者掌了权，还能按老黄历搞生产？格府绸今早入库啦！”
    “入库啦？”老李半信半疑地向仓库走去。
    一进库，老李就见到一堆堆包装得齐整整的格府绸，这使他又高兴，又惊讶：“不简单！这么娇气难产的品种，要是在走资本主义道路当权派的旧章法下，四万米的格府绸，三天也完不成！现在咱们一天就拿了下来！”老李嘴角露出了笑容，他忙问道：“哎，这‘金猴’的跟斗是怎样翻的啊？”
    “真正当家作主了，就有了使不完的劲呗！”一个小伙子充满豪情地笑着说：“昨天，咱们一听这批产品是给兄弟厂加工的，他们又急着用，大家就纷纷表示：干！咱们齐心合力，干出个新纪录，闯出个新水平！等布匹一到，大家就紧张地干开啦！一个个手把电钮，随开随停，耳听机声，眼观运转，跑前跑后，汗流满脸……”说到这里，小伙子故意把舌头一吐：“嗨嗨，老李！这‘金猴’的跟斗，就这样翻了十万八千里！”说罢，他就情不自禁地唱起了“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”的毛主席语录歌。
    这时，机器转得更欢快，小伙子唱得更响亮。
    保全室里的捷报
    在宽大的保全室里，红色造反者正在与革命职工、技术员开会讨论“三效”的检修问题。
    这“三效”（把烧碱蒸浓的三个蒸发器）是全厂生产环节中的心脏。过去检修一次，需要六天时间。因此，每年总要等到春节才能进行检修。今年为了抓革命，促生产，春节决定不放假。一个困难的问题摆在红色造反者的面前：不修么，到年中出了故障怎么办？修么，春节不放假，怎么个修法？
    面对这道难题，红色造反者在会上反复地学习了毛主席语录：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”
    毛泽东思想是革命的根本，智慧的海洋，斗争的武器，胜利的保证。他们越学心里越亮堂。
    这时，一个虎虎有生气的造反者，捋起袖口，挥动手臂大声说道：“毛主席的话千真万确！毛泽东思想武装了咱们的头脑，咱们夺了权，掌了权，还有什么奇迹不能创造！我建议咱们来它个‘孙悟空大闹天宫’，把人员分成三班，就在星期日把这个检修任务夺下来！”
    话刚落，就获得了许多人的热烈赞同；可坐在角落里的一个资产阶级当权派却慢条斯理的说：“一天修好，不简单，那是奇迹，那是奇迹！”
    这分明是泼凉水！一位老工人两眼冒火，忙站起来说：“咱们红色造反者就是不简单：毛主席给咱们撑腰，咱们要给毛主席争气！你们过去用假日加双薪刺激咱们干活，把咱们迷迷糊糊地往资本主义道上领，这怎能叫咱们使出全身的劲！现在，咱们自己当家作主了，毛泽东思想挂帅了，砸碎旧框框，一天完全可以把它检修好！”
    工人们理直气壮地驳斥了资产阶级当权派之后，群策群力，想了许多好办法：为了保证人力，各车间抽人支援；为了不打无准备之仗，事先就把工具备齐；把新加热器推进车间，等等。
    星期日，一场抢修战斗开始了。工人们合成一颗心，拧成一股劲，拉管的拉管，吊链的吊链……。你赶我，我赶你，大家把自己的革命干劲使在每颗螺丝、每个零件上，个个干得汗流满面，热气腾腾。困难时，就诵读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”疲乏时，就诵读“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战
  （即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”经过一天一晚的激烈战斗，巨大的新加热器安装好了，它又象心脏一样，把大量的碱源源不断地输送到车间。一天完成六天的任务，这不是一个简单的数字，它为红色造反者掌权后写出了一张金光闪闪的抓革命促生产的大红捷报！
    协作花开
    一天，光华染厂生产科的一位同志接完电话以后，急急忙忙走进了红色造反者的大队部。
    “正好，你们都在这里！刚才光华织厂来电话向我们求援：他们厂有十多匹色织线呢被水浸湿了，现在要赶着入库外调，可是那些资产阶级当权派不仅撂挑子不干，而且还抓住这件事大作文章，企图达到打击织厂红色造反者的目的。现在，他们想借我们的烘干机把布过过水，烘烘干。”
    这时，有一个在场的资产阶级当权派摇头晃脑地说：“这事可得仔细想想！如果加工不好，密度不够，幅宽不合，怎么办？谁负责？”
    “我们负责！”一位红色造反者的负责人用洪钟般的声音压过去：“天塌了有我们顶！地陷了有我们填！全国的革命派心连心，他们遇到了困难，我们就要支援！”
    战斗在烘干机旁的红色造反者一听到支援兄弟厂的消息，个个磨拳擦掌地说：“快运来，我们干！”
    为了保证这项任务的胜利完成，他们加强了人力，作好了战斗前的一切准备工作。等线呢一运来，大家飞针走线，把布头衔接起来。刹那间，烘干机飞速转动，几百米长的线呢象巨龙一样，从机器上面翻飞过去。红色造反者个个劲头十足，聚精会神地进行着操作。经过一场争分夺秒的紧张战斗，色织线呢终于烘干了。
    当他们带着喜悦的心情把布匹拆下来进行检验的时候，突然发现其中有两匹布幅宽不够，怎么办？正在这时，分幅工人闻讯赶来，把布抱去，他们凭着以往的实际操作经验，大胆打破框框，将分幅机拉开，创造性地进行了拉宽。在染厂红色造反者的大协作之下，织厂的线呢终于处理好了。
    十多匹被水浸湿的线呢完好无损地运出去了，织厂的红色造反者紧紧握住染厂红色造反者的手，激动得说不出一句话来……。
