To seize power for the Party, to seize power for the proletariat, to seize power for communism—even if it means plunging into boiling water or being torn to pieces!

The people's army is the tool of the proletarian dictatorship and the pillar of socialism. At this critical moment in this life-and-death struggle for power, can we stand idly by? No, we cannot! We firmly support the revolutionary leftists and stand as their steadfast rear guard.

The People's Liberation Army is the pillar and important tool of the proletarian dictatorship. The great alliance of revolutionary leftists is sweeping across the country to seize power. If we do not support them, who will? If we do not aid them, who will? We resolutely unite with the proletarian revolutionary leftists, fight alongside them, and seize power for the Party, for the people, and for communism! Seize power! Seize power! Seize power!

Power is the lifeline of the proletariat and the iron rice bowl of the revolutionary people. To defend the proletarian dictatorship, we are willing to climb the knife mountain, enter the sea of fire, and be torn to pieces.

In a class society, we proletarian revolutionaries are born to seize power and consolidate it, and we die to seize power and consolidate it.

The mountains and rivers are ours. The power is ours. If we do not hold it, who will? If we do not defend it, who will? Losing power means losing the red mountains and rivers.

To make a revolution, we must seize power. To seize power, we must not fear difficulties. As long as it is for the proletariat to seize power, even if it means sacrificing our lives, we are willing.

Those who walk the capitalist road and are in power must be dealt with like poisonous snakes—we must not only kill them but also burn them to ashes and throw them into the abyss, so they never rise again.

Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, but the red power must not be lost. We will climb the knife mountain, enter the sea of fire, and be torn to pieces to seize power.

“Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” This is an absolute truth. We will use the gun to defend the red power and create a brand-new, red communist world, letting the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position.

    战士谈夺权
    为党夺权，为无产阶级夺权，为共产主义夺权，哪怕赴汤蹈火，粉身碎骨！
          ×　×　×
    人民军队是无产阶级专政的工具，社会主义的柱石。在这场你死我活的夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们能坐视不动吗？不能，决不能！我们坚决支持革命左派，做革命左派的坚强后盾。
          ×　×　×
    解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级专政的重要工具。广大革命左派大联合，在全国全面展开夺权斗争，我们不支持，谁支持？我们不援助，谁援助？我们坚决和无产阶级革命左派联合在一起，战斗在一起，为党，为人民，为共产主义夺权！夺权！夺权！
        ×　×　×
    政权是无产阶级的命根子，是革命人民的铁饭碗。为了保卫无产阶级政权，我们上刀山，入火海，粉身碎骨也心甘情愿。
          ×　×　×
    在阶级社会里，我们无产阶级革命者，就是为夺取政权、巩固政权而生，为夺取政权、巩固政权而死。
          ×　×　×
    江山，我们的江山。政权，我们的政权。我们不掌，谁掌？我们不保，谁保？失去了政权，就是失去了红色的江山。
          ×　×　×
    要革命就得夺权，要夺权就不怕困难。只要是为无产阶级夺权，哪怕是献出生命，也心甘情愿。
          ×　×　×
    对那些走资本主义道路的当权派，也要象打毒蛇一样，不但要打死，而且还要把它烧成灰烬，扔进深渊里，让它永世不得翻身。
          ×　×　×
    头可断，血可流，红色政权不可丢。上刀山，入火海，粉身碎骨夺政权。
          ×　×　×
    “枪杆子里面出政权”，这是千真万确的真理。我们要用枪杆子，保卫红色的政权，创造出一个崭新的红彤彤的共产主义新世界来，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
