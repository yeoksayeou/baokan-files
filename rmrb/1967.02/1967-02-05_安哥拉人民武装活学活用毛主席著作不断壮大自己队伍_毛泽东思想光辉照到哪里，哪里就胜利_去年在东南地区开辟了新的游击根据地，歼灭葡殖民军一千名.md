The armed struggle of the Angolan people for national independence, now in its seventh year, is developing further. The victories they have won over the past six years, especially in the past year, vividly prove that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for all oppressed peoples and nations seeking liberation.

In their six-year armed struggle, which began on February 4, 1961, the revolutionary people of Angola have gradually gained a deeper understanding of the great Mao Zedong Thought and have increasingly emphasized the study of Chairman Mao's works. They have printed Chairman Mao's famous work "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" and other military works into small booklets in Portuguese. They often use the great truths expounded by Chairman Mao to summarize their experiences in battle.

Many of Chairman Mao's famous military principles have deeply impressed the hearts of Angolan guerrillas. Angolan fighters admire and are gradually applying Chairman Mao's teachings on "learning war from war," "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," establishing rural bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and the strategy and tactics of people's war. Some of them have fluently recited the sixteen-character formula to a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." A guerrilla leader fighting in the "Mayumbe" forest of Cabinda once told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Angolan guerrillas regard Chairman Mao's military works as "sunlight in the forest," the "most precious guide to defeating a cunning enemy."

Wherever Mao Zedong Thought is applied, there is victory. The Angolan people have continuously learned from and applied the invincible Mao Zedong Thought over the past six years, and therefore, they have persisted in armed struggle under difficult conditions and won victory after victory.

On February 4, 1961, the Angolan people, who had long suffered under Portuguese colonial oppression, could no longer endure it. They launched an armed attack on the colonial prison and police headquarters in the capital, Luanda, sending out the first signal of armed struggle. Soon after, peasants in the northern part of Luanda Province took up arms to fight for land and national liberation. Guerrilla warfare quickly spread across the vast region. The enemy's brutal suppression and sabotage made the armed struggle face great difficulties, but the brave Angolan people, once they took up arms, would never lay them down. Instead, they held their guns tighter and persisted in continuing the war. They deeply felt from their own experience the truth of Chairman Mao's brilliant statement: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Now, in the vast territory of Angola, guerrilla warfare is being waged in three regions. In Cabinda, guerrilla bases have been established for several years. Angolan fighters have surrounded the Portuguese colonial army's major military center and destroyed many farms operated by colonialists. In the vast areas of North Kwanza and Luanda Provinces, not far from the capital, the first guerrilla base was established as early as 1961. The flames of guerrilla warfare have never been extinguished there and are burning more fiercely this year. Despite the Portuguese colonialists' daily bombing of villages, the revolutionary people are not intimidated. They reorganize and continue the fight with the help of the guerrillas after entering the forest. Therefore, Western newspapers have to call this region the "rotten triangle." The opening of the southeastern front in the Moxico region is a new and important development in the armed struggle last year. Guerrilla bases have been established in villages such as Cassombo and Lumbarla. Guerrilla warfare is developing rapidly in this vast area of over 80,000 square kilometers.

The development of Angola's armed struggle last year was not only reflected in the expansion of guerrilla zones but also in the significant scale of guerrilla warfare. In the southeastern region alone, about 1,000 Portuguese colonial troops were annihilated, 35 bridges and many roads were destroyed, and more than 20 trucks were blown up.

Although U.S. imperialism and other NATO aggressor countries provide the Portuguese colonialists with the latest weapons, the Portuguese colonial army is increasingly being surrounded by the revolutionary people who have taken up arms.

When reviewing the victories they achieved last year, Angolan fighters believe that an important experience is: as Chairman Mao taught, to go to the masses and mobilize them to participate in guerrilla warfare. Some guerrilla leaders often quote Chairman Mao's saying when talking about the importance of this aspect: "The great power of the people's war lies in the masses." They give examples: Portuguese colonialists, in order to separate the guerrillas in the northern region from the revolutionary masses, forcibly drove the scattered farmers to their fortified areas, just as the U.S. imperialists did in South Vietnam to build "strategic hamlets." However, their plot did not succeed. The guerrillas entered these "strategic hamlets," organized and armed the farmers inside, resulting in the enemy becoming more isolated and the guerrilla forces growing stronger.

In addition, patriotic armed forces sent political workers to the guerrilla zones to strengthen political and ideological work among the masses and raise their political consciousness.

An Angolan leader said: "We need to carry out our work abroad, but our fundamental work must be done among the masses at home, because only by mobilizing and organizing the masses in the guerrilla zones can we achieve the final victory of the people's war."

### 安哥拉人民武装活学活用毛主席著作不断壮大自己队伍  毛泽东思想光辉照到哪里，哪里就胜利  去年在东南地区开辟了新的游击根据地，歼灭葡殖民军一千名

    安哥拉人民武装活学活用毛主席著作不断壮大自己队伍
    毛泽东思想光辉照到哪里，哪里就胜利
    去年在东南地区开辟了新的游击根据地，歼灭葡殖民军一千名
    据新华社布拉柴维尔四日电　安哥拉人民争取民族独立的武装斗争，在进入第七年的时候，正进一步深入发展。六年来，特别是过去一年中，他们所取得的胜利生动地证明：毛泽东思想是一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族求解放的强大武器。
    安哥拉革命人民在一九六一年二月四日开始的六年武装斗争中，逐步对伟大的毛泽东思想有更深刻的认识，越来越重视学习毛主席的著作。他们自己把毛主席的著名著作《中国革命战争的战略问题》和其他的军事著作印成了葡萄牙文的小册子。他们还经常用毛主席所阐明的伟大真理来总结战斗中的经验。
    毛主席的许多著名军事论断已经深深地印在安哥拉游击队员的心中。安哥拉战士们无限钦佩并在逐步地运用毛主席的“从战争学习战争”、“枪杆子里面出政权”、建立农村根据地、乡村包围城市、人民战争的战略和战术等教导。他们之中有些人曾向新华社记者流畅地背诵十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”。战斗在喀奔达“马尤姆贝”密林中的一位游击队领导人有一次对新华社记者说，安哥拉游击战士把毛主席的军事著作当作“密林中的阳光”，是“战胜狡猾敌人的最珍贵的指南。”
    毛泽东思想用在哪里，哪里就取得胜利。安哥拉人民六年来不断学习和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，也就因此，他们在艰难的条件下坚持了武装斗争，并且取得了一个又一个胜利。
    一九六一年二月四日，备受葡萄牙殖民压迫的安哥拉人民，忍无可忍，武装袭击了首都罗安达的殖民监狱和警察总部，发出了武装斗争的第一个信号。接着，罗安达州北部的农民就拿起武器投入争取土地和民族解放的斗争。游击战争很快就在广大地区开展起来。敌人的残酷镇压和破坏使武装斗争遇到了极大困难，但是，英勇的安哥拉人民一旦拿起武器，就决不会放下，相反，他们把枪握得更紧，坚持把战争继续下去。他们从亲身的经历中，越来越深刻地体会到毛主席的这一英明论断：“枪杆子里面出政权”。
    现在，在安哥拉广阔的国土上，有三个地区正在进行着游击战争。在喀奔达，建立游击根据地已经有好些年了。安哥拉战士在这里曾包围过葡萄牙殖民军的大军事中心，毁坏了殖民主义者经营的大批农场。在离首都不远的北宽扎州和罗安达州的广大地区，早在一九六一年就建立了第一个游击根据地。那里游击战争的火焰从来没有熄灭过，而且今年燃烧得更加炽烈了。尽管葡萄牙殖民主义者天天滥炸村庄，但是，革命人民是吓不倒的，他们在进入森林之后，在游击队帮助下，重新组织起来，继续战斗。因此西方报纸只好把这个地区叫做“溃烂的三角地带”。在莫西哥地区开辟东南战线，是去年武装斗争新的重要进展。在卡索姆波和卢姆巴拉等乡村，已经建立了游击根据地。在这片八万多平方公里的广大地区，游击战发展得很快。
    去年安哥拉武装斗争的发展，不仅表现在游击区的扩大，而且还表现在游击战有了较大的规模。单单在东南地区，去年就歼灭了约一千名葡萄牙殖民军，破坏了三十五座桥梁和许多公路，击毁二十多辆卡车。
    尽管美帝国主义和其它北大西洋侵略集团成员国向葡萄牙殖民主义者提供各种最新式的武器，但是葡萄牙殖民军正越来越深地陷入拿起武器的革命人民的重重包围之中。
    安哥拉战士在回顾他们去年所取得的胜利时，认为一个重要经验是：象毛主席所教导的那样，到群众中去，动员他们参加游击战争。一些游击队领导人在谈到这方面的重要性时，经常引用毛主席的名言：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”他们举例说：葡萄牙殖民者为了把北方地区的游击战士同革命群众隔开，强行把分散居住的农民全部赶到他们的碉堡附近的集中地区去，就象美帝国主义者在南越那样建立“战略村”。但是他们的阴谋并没有得逞。游击队深入这些“战略村”，把里面的农民组织和武装起来，结果使敌人更加孤立，游击队的力量得到更大的发展。
    另外，爱国武装力量把政治工作人员派到游击区去，在群众中加强政治思想工作，提高他们的政治觉悟。
    一位安哥拉领导人说：“我们需要在国外开展我们的工作，但是，我们的根本工作要在我们国内的群众中进行，因为只有动员和组织游击区的群众，才能取得人民战争的最后胜利。”（附图片）
