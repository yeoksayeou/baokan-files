Comrade Chen Yi sent a telegram on the 31st to Chinese students in France who were subjected to unreasonable beatings and illegal detention by French police, expressing his heartfelt sympathy. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Embassy in the Soviet Union, to all students in France:

Dear comrades and students,

We are greatly indignant to hear that you have been subjected to unreasonable beatings and illegal detention by French police.

Your action of submitting a protest letter to the Soviet Embassy in France is a revolutionary action, and we firmly support you. Your courage to fight and overcome difficulties, ultimately achieving victory, demonstrates the heroic spirit of Chinese revolutionary youth under the guidance of Chairman Mao. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to you. Chairman Mao teaches us that "the various forms of oppression and slaughter inflicted on the people by imperialism and all reactionaries are in themselves a stimulus for the people's more extensive, more thorough, and more bitter struggle." Those who suppress revolutions will meet a bad end.

We salute you with the revolutionary greetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chen Yi

    陈毅同志电慰我留法学生
    新华社三十一日讯　陈毅同志三十一日打电报给遭到法国警察无理殴打和非法拘捕的中国留法学生，向他们表示亲切的慰问。电报全文如下：驻苏使馆转全体留法学生亲爱的同学们、同志们：
    听到你们遭到法国警察的无理殴打和非法拘捕等消息，我们十分愤慨。
    你们向苏联驻法国大使馆递交抗议书的行动是革命的行动，我们坚决支持你们。你们敢于斗争，克服险阻，终于取得胜利，表现了毛主席教导下的中国革命青年的英雄气概，我们向你们致以亲切的慰问。毛主席教导我们说，帝国主义、各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”凡是镇压革命的人，都没有好下场。
    向你们致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
                      陈毅
      一九六七年一月三十一日
