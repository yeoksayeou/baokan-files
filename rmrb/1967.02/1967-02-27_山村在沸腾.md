The village is boiling with energy. Poor and lower-middle peasants, with red hearts and full of vigor, are revolutionary pioneers and production leaders. They take Chairman Mao's words as their guiding principle. This spring plowing battle, they are determined to win. They plan at night, and the drums of battle sound. The production wave rises, and the village is boiling. They accumulate fertilizer and develop water conservancy projects, with songs reaching the clouds. They select seeds and repair farm tools, busy every moment. They irrigate fields to prevent spring droughts, and prepare the land to retain moisture. When the cuckoo calls, they start plowing and begin spring farming. Looking ahead to the new countryside, there is a bright future. The mountains and rivers are adorned with new colors, and laughter fills every corner!

    山村在沸腾
    吉显贫农下中农，心红有干劲，革命是闯将，生产带头行。毛主席的话，当作座右铭，春耕这一仗，坚决要打赢。星夜作规划，战斗锣鼓鸣，生产高潮起，山村在沸腾。积肥兴水利，歌声高入云，选种修农具，时刻忙不停。灌田防春旱，整地保墒情，布谷一声叫，开犁闹春耕。展望新农村，一片好前程，山河添新色，处处欢笑声！
