In response to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," the revolutionary rebels of the Qingdao Marine Fisheries Company who set out to sea first have achieved brilliant results after nearly ten days of hard work. On the 14th, they returned triumphantly with their holds full of fresh fish, marking the start of the spring tide production campaign.

Since the end of last year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Ministry of Fisheries and the Qingdao Marine Fisheries Company, along with diehard elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, plotted and created the incident of stopping fishing boats at the port. They attempted to use this to split the revolutionary rebels and suppress the broad masses of sailors from revolting, directly opposing Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution and promote production." However, the revolutionary rebels armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong quickly saw through their schemes and fought resolutely against them. Finally, they broke through numerous difficulties and set sail victoriously on February 5.

The revolutionary rebels who set out to sea displayed the spirit of bravery, fearlessness, and hard work. On the second day at sea, they encountered winds of seven or eight levels and a sudden drop in temperature, making fishing operations difficult. However, these warriors followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They overcame various difficulties and achieved one victory after another. The warriors on the No. 230 and No. 231 fishing boats, undaunted by the biting cold wind, fought continuously for more than seven hours in six or seven level winds and waves, creating a high-yield record of catching more than 400 boxes of fish in one net. The warriors on the No. 220 and No. 221 fishing boats, with the high enthusiasm of masters and sky-high revolutionary spirit, created a daily output record of 1,100 boxes, reaching the highest level in the same period in history. This time, the ten pairs of fishing boats that returned victorious caught a total of more than 23,000 boxes of fish in six days of operations.

The news of their victory brought joy and excitement to the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers of the Qingdao Marine Fisheries Company. On February 16, they beat drums and gongs to welcome their victorious comrades at the dock and held a welcoming ceremony. The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee, the Qingdao Red Guard Liaison Headquarters of colleges and universities, the Dongfanghong Commune of Qingdao Medical College, and other revolutionary organizations, as well as the land and naval forces stationed in Qingdao, all sent representatives to participate in the welcoming ceremony.

    鼓干劲，战风浪，打响春汛生产第一炮
    青岛海洋渔业公司首批出海的革命造反派取得辉煌战果
    新华社济南十八日电　坚决响应我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，山东省青岛海洋渔业公司首批出海捕鱼的无产阶级革命派战士们，经过近十天的奋战，取得了辉煌战果，十四日满载舱舱鲜鱼胜利归来，为迎接春汛生产高潮的到来打响了第一炮。
    去年年底以来，水产部和青岛海洋渔业公司党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，策划并制造了渔轮停港事件，妄想以此挑起无产阶级革命派内部的分裂，压制广大船员起来革命，直接与毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示相对抗。但是，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派战士们，及时识破了他们的阴谋，并且同他们进行了坚决的斗争，终于冲破重重困难，在二月五日胜利出海。
    出海的无产阶级革命派战士们，发扬了勇敢战斗、不怕艰苦的革命精神，迎着寒风巨浪英勇前进。出海第二天就遇上七、八级的大风，气温骤降，给捕捞作业带来了困难。但是，这些战士遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，克服了种种困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。二三○号和二三一号渔轮上的战士们，在六、七级的大风浪中，不畏刺骨寒风，连续奋战七个多小时，创造了一网捕鱼四百多箱的高产纪录。二二○ 号和二二一号渔轮上的战士们，以主人翁的高度热情和冲天的革命干劲，创造了日产量一千一百箱的纪录，达到了历年同期的最高水平。这次胜利返航的十对渔轮，在出海的六天作业中，共捕鱼二万三千多箱。
    喜讯传来，青岛海洋渔业公司的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，欢欣鼓舞。二月十六日这一天，他们敲锣打鼓，到码头热烈迎接胜利返航的战友，并且举行了欢迎大会。青岛市革命造反委员会，青岛大中学校红卫兵联络总部、青岛医学院东方红公社等革命组织，以及驻青岛陆、海军，都派出代表参加了欢迎大会。
