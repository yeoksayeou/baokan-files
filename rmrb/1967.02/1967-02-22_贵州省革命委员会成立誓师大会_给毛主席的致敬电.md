The establishment of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the pledge rally sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, the full text of which is as follows:

To our most, most, most, most beloved great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao:

We, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat in Guizhou, who are forever loyal to you, with hearts full of boundless love, boundless faith, and boundless reverence, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary combat salute to you, the reddest red sun in our hearts!

Today, we in Guizhou held the "Establishment of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee Pledge Rally" in Guiyang. We are extremely excited to report to you: Under your personal call and support, and under the correct guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, we, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, have achieved great unity, seized power from a handful of capitalists who were in charge, and are now advancing forward. After careful deliberation and consultation, we have established a temporary power organ—the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee—composed of leaders from revolutionary mass organizations, military representatives, and revolutionary leaders from party and government organs. This is a new great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is a tremendous joy for the 17 million people of various ethnic groups in Guizhou! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! No words can express our heartfelt love for you! We sing, we leap, and we shout a million times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!!!

Most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: You said, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it." We, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, will definitely remember your teachings. We not only have the courage to seize power but also have the determination, confidence, and ability to hold and secure it. "Beside the wrecked ship, a thousand sails pass; in front of the sick tree, ten thousand flowers bloom." After eliminating the pests, we, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, will build a new socialist Guizhou!

"Though the iron road is long and steep, we now take the first step to cross it." The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, born in the flames of the proletarian cultural revolution, and all revolutionary fighters pledge to you:

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. We will definitely hold high and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you in all our work.

You taught us: "Policy is the starting point of all practical actions of a revolutionary party, and it is manifested in the process and outcome of actions." We will definitely thoroughly, unconditionally, and comprehensively implement all the policies you have formulated.

"Grasp revolution, promote production," and "be thrifty and revolutionary," these are your great calls. We will definitely listen to your words 100%, and act according to your instructions 100%. We will mobilize the broad masses of revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the province to grasp revolution and promote production, achieving double victories in revolution and production. We will definitely resolutely strike down economism, not indulge in extravagance, not seek luxury, and "save every penny for the cause of war and revolution."

All the achievements we have made are victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless force, a powerful spiritual atomic bomb. We will definitely better study and apply your works, and push the movement of studying and applying your works to a new high, promoting the thought revolution of the people.

In the new stage of the proletarian cultural revolution, we will definitely pursue the enemy to the end, seize all power within the province, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Most beloved Chairman Mao: We know that the struggle has just begun. To consolidate the victory of seizing power, we still have a lot of painstaking and meticulous work to do and need to redouble our efforts. "The most beautiful scenery is on the dangerous peak." We firmly believe that with your personal care and support, and with the invincible and unyielding Mao Zedong Thought, "we can learn what we originally do not understand. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." We will definitely quickly establish a new revolutionary order of the proletariat, fully tap into the wisdom of the broad masses, and through transition, create a new political organizational form that is more suitable for the socialist economic base.

You warned us: "We must not relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs just because of victory." We, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, will definitely remember your teachings, be more humble, more cautious, guard against arrogance and impetuousness, and wholeheartedly serve the people. We will definitely forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, forever follow you, and sail forward against the wind and waves!

Let all enemies tremble in front of us, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, in the face of our continuous victory cheers!

Looking to the future, it is limitlessly bright. The mountains of Guizhou will be as red as a painting. Let us raise our arms high and welcome a new, red, and shining Guizhou, where Mao Zedong Thought shines everywhere!

We sincerely wish you, the reddest red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!
