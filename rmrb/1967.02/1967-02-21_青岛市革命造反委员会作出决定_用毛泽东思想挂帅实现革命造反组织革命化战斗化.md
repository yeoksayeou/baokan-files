The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee has decided to launch a rectification movement in all revolutionary rebel organizations throughout the city using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner to achieve the revolutionization and militarization of revolutionary rebel organizations.

	New China News Agency, Qingdao, February 20th — Decision of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee on Launching a Rectification Movement in All Revolutionary Rebel Organizations Throughout the City

	(I)

	On January 22nd, the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee seized all the powers previously held by the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party who controlled the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee. After crushing the frenzied counterattack by the class enemy to seize power, the committee launched a full-scale struggle to seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party at the grassroots level throughout the city. The bourgeois reactionary line has completely collapsed, and the clique of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the party is on the verge of annihilation under the relentless blows of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Driven by the revolutionary situation, the production front is also celebrating victories, with the total industrial output for January exceeding the plan; the countryside is preparing for spring plowing and sowing. Currently, the revolutionary situation in Qingdao is excellent.

	At present, the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses in our city to unite and seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party has entered a new stage focused on consolidating power. However, the class enemy, unwilling to perish, is desperately struggling in their last throes, frantically plotting new conspiracies to disrupt the unity of the revolutionary ranks, sabotage the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, disrupt production, and ultimately achieve their goal of sabotaging the new proletarian regime.

	The proletarian revolutionary masses, due to their achievements and victories, have developed a sense of complacency and arrogance in some organizations, especially among some leaders, and have fostered erroneous thoughts such as sectarianism. These erroneous thoughts have provided the enemy with opportunities to attack. The enemy is using these erroneous thoughts, employing tactics such as infiltrating, dividing, and creating schisms, to disrupt the revolutionary ranks, sabotage the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses to unite and seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, and undermine the new regime we have established. This is a major issue that we urgently need to address in order to consolidate and expand the great unity of the revolutionary left, strengthen the great unity of the revolutionary left, and successfully carry out the struggle to seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and consolidate the new proletarian regime.

	To consolidate and expand the great unity of the revolutionary left, strengthen the great unity of the revolutionary left, and successfully carry out the struggle to seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and consolidate the new proletarian regime, the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee has decided to launch a comprehensive rectification movement in all revolutionary rebel organizations throughout the city.

	(II)

	Content of the rectification: Thoroughly criticize and rectify sectarianism, dispersionism, factionalism, non-organizational views, ultra-democratism, localism, individualism, anarchism, subjectivism, arrogance, and the erroneous tendencies of excluding everything, opposing everything, and striking down everything. Correctly handle the issue of cadres.

	Focus of the rectification: Primarily target the standing committee members and committee members of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee, and the leading comrades of various revolutionary rebel organizations.

	Method of the rectification: Emphasize politics, implement Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, combine theory with practice, link it with thoughts, and repeatedly and seriously study Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party" and the "Old Three Articles," as well as the editorial "On the Struggle of the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses to Seize Power" from the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine in 1967. During the study, theory should be linked with practice, and the spirit of the documents should be deeply understood from beginning to end, with the focus on eliminating private interests and establishing public interests.

	Adhering to the principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," the rectification will be open, encouraging and welcoming everyone to offer criticism to the leadership. Leaders and comrades should adhere to the principles of being strict with oneself and lenient with others, and doing good to others, insisting on speaking without fear, speaking frankly, and having no guilt for speaking, and being cautious for hearing. Emphasize self-revolution, dare to carry out self-revolution, and cultivate the spirit of cutting off the tail, thoroughly excavating the private interests deep in the soul.

	Time: Each organization and unit will decide based on their actual situation, following the principle that non-production units should have more time than production units.

	(III)

	Each revolutionary rebel organization should, based on the open letter issued by the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee on the rectification movement, conduct thorough and in-depth mobilization, making every comrade understand the great significance of this rectification movement and understand that this rectification movement is a major issue related to whether the new proletarian regime can be consolidated and whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be carried out to the end.

	The leadership of the rectification movement should be strengthened. The main leading comrades of each revolutionary rebel organization should personally take charge and see it through to the end.

	Newspapers and radio stations should propagate and report on the rectification movement as a key content. The battle reports and radio stations of each revolutionary rebel organization should also propagate around this center. Each revolutionary rebel organization can also organize amateur propaganda teams to perform propaganda.

	This movement is a movement to combine current struggles with the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and a movement to eliminate private interests and establish public interests. Throughout the movement, the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought should be held high from beginning to end, implementing Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, and using Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for this movement.

	This rectification movement will surely achieve great victories under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Finally, a stern warning to the clique of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the party and all the ghosts and monsters in society: you are only allowed to be honest and law-abiding, and not allowed to cause trouble. If you dare to take advantage of the rectification by the proletarian revolutionary masses to stir up trouble, sow discord, and carry out sabotage, we will definitely suppress you and smash your heads!

    青岛市革命造反委员会作出决定
    用毛泽东思想挂帅实现革命造反组织革命化战斗化
    新华社青岛二十日电　青岛市革命造反委员会关于在全市革命造反组织中开展整风运动的决定
    （一）
    青岛市革命造反委员会于一月二十二日夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所把持的前青岛市委、市人委的一切大权，打垮了阶级敌人反夺权的疯狂反扑后，接着在全市基层展开了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派全面夺权的斗争。资产阶级反动路线全线崩溃，一小撮混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派在无产阶级革命派的无情打击下，已趋灭亡。在革命形势的推动下，生产战线也高奏凯歌，一月份工业生产总值超额完成了计划；农村正准备春耕春种。当前，青岛市革命形势一片大好。
    目前，我市无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，已进入了以巩固政权为主的新阶段。但阶级敌人不甘心灭亡，他们在绝望中垂死挣扎，正在拚命施展新的阴谋诡计，破坏革命队伍的团结，破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，破坏生产，企图最后达到其破坏无产阶级新政权的目的。
    无产阶级革命派，由于取得了成绩和胜利，在一些组织中，特别是在一些领导人中，滋长了骄傲自满的情绪，滋长了小团体主义等错误思想。这些错误思想，给敌人提供了进攻的缺口。敌人正在利用这些错误思想，采取打进来、拉出去，挑拨离间，制造分裂等手法，搅乱革命阵营，破坏无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，破坏我们已经建立的新政权。这是当前巩固和扩大革命左派大联合，加强革命左派大团结，进行夺权和巩固新政权所面临的和急需解决的重大问题。
    为了巩固和扩大革命左派大联合，加强革命左派大团结，胜利进行向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争和巩固无产阶级新政权，青岛市革命造反委员会决定在全市革命造反组织中进行全面整风运动。
    （二）
    整风内容：彻底批判和纠正小团体主义、分散主义、宗派主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、本位主义、个人主义、无政府主义、主观主义、骄傲自满和排斥一切、反对一切、打击一切的错误倾向，正确对待干部问题。
    整风重点：以青岛市革命造反委员会的常委、委员，各革命造反组织的领导同志为主。
    整风方法：突出政治，实行毛泽东思想挂帅，结合实际，联系思想，反复认真地学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”，及《红旗》杂志一九六七年第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》等文章。学习时，要理论联系实际，深入领会文件精神，从头至尾贯穿破私立公。
    本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”，“团结——批评——团结”的方针，实行开门整风，鼓励和欢迎大家向领导提意见。领导之间、同志之间本着对己严、对人宽和与人为善的态度，坚持知无不言，言无不尽，言者无罪，闻者足戒的原则，互相谈心，互相帮助。强调自我革命，勇于自我革命，发扬割尾巴的精神，狠挖灵魂深处的私字。
    时间：各组织、各单位根据实际情况，按照非生产单位多于生产单位的原则，自己决定。
    （三）
    各革命造反组织要根据青岛市革命造反委员会关于整风运动发出的公开信，进行充分的深入的动员，使每一个同志明确这一整风运动的重大意义，明确这一整风运动是关系到能否巩固无产阶级新政权和将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的一个重大问题。
    要加强整风运动的领导。各革命造反组织的主要领导同志要亲自动手抓，一抓到底。
    报纸和电台要把整风运动作为重点内容进行宣传和报道。各革命造反组织的战报、广播站也要围绕这个中心进行宣传。各革命造反组织还可组织业余宣传队，进行演出宣传。
    这一运动，就是结合当前斗争，活学活用毛主席著作的运动，就是破私立公的运动。在运动中要自始至终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，实行毛泽东思想挂帅，把毛泽东思想作为这一运动的指南。
    这一整风运动，必将在毛泽东思想的指引下取得重大胜利。
    最后，严厉警告混进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，及社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神，只准你们老老实实，规规矩矩，不准你们乱说乱动。你们如若胆敢乘无产阶级革命派整风之际，兴风作浪，挑拨离间，进行破坏，我们就要坚决镇压，砸烂你们的脑袋！
                                     青岛市革命造反委员会
                                     一九六七年二月十六日
