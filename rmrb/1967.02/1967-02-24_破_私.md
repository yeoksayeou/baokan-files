Title: Smashing the "Self"
Author: Wang Dalun Yao Zhenyuan

Edition: 6

With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we must proactively attack the "self," launching fierce assaults and not fighting passively.

Concentrate our forces to engage in close combat, to fight battles of annihilation, seeking total victory in every battle. If we do not achieve total victory, we will not stand down.

Adopt the "three fierce" tactics of fierce attack, fierce charge, and fierce pursuit. For fleeting selfish thoughts, we must pursue and strike them down, daring to engage in close combat, and swiftly annihilate them.

Strengthen our vigilance, be adept at discovering "enemies" in our thoughts, and resolutely eliminate them as they appear, not allowing any invading "enemies" to find a foothold or hiding place.

After each battle, we must summarize our combat experience and raise our consciousness.

After winning a battle, we must guard against arrogance and impatience, not relaxing our combat resolve in the slightest. We must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, continually transform our thoughts, and press forward with our victories.

    破“私”
    以毛泽东思想为武器，向“私”字主动进攻，猛烈开火，不打被动之仗。
    集中力量，打近战，打歼灭战，每战必求全胜，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    发扬猛打、猛冲、猛追的“三猛”战术，对于一闪而过的私心杂念，必须跟踪追击，敢于刺刀见红，迅速全歼。
    加强戒备，善于发现思想上的“敌人”，坚决做到来者即歼，决不让入侵之“敌”有立足之地，藏身之处。
    每战一次，必须总结一次战斗经验，提高一次觉悟。
    打了胜仗，戒骄戒躁，不得丝毫松懈战斗意志，要百倍提高警惕，不断改造思想，乘胜前进。
