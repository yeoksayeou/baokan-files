Our personnel stationed in France, Cambodia, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Mali, Burma, Tanzania, Tunisia, Syria, East Germany, Bulgaria, Yemen, Denmark, and Pakistan have held meetings or sent telegrams and letters in recent days to strongly protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership in instigating hooligans to attack our embassy in the Soviet Union and assault our diplomatic personnel and journalists! They have expressed warm regards and support to the red diplomats of our embassy in the Soviet Union, and have enthusiastically praised their proletarian revolutionary spirit of maintaining national dignity, fearlessly resisting aggression, and fighting tenaciously against the Soviet revisionists.

The staff of our embassy in the United Kingdom and our consulate in Zanzibar also held meetings to strongly denounce the barbaric acts of the Soviet revisionist leadership! They expressed their determination to learn from their comrades at our embassy in the Soviet Union, who are at the forefront of the anti-revisionist struggle, and to fearlessly fight and actively apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

At the same time, the staff of the Xinhua News Agency's branches in Paris, Phnom Penh, Colombo, London, Bamako, Rangoon, Dar es Salaam, Tunis, Damascus, Addis Ababa, Berlin, Sofia, Sana'a, and Rawalpindi, as well as the staff of the Civil Aviation Administration of China's office in Rangoon and the branch of the Bank of China in London, held meetings or sent telegrams to express their strong indignation and strongest protest against the new fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists. They pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's instigation of hooligans to attack our embassy in the Soviet Union and assault our diplomatic personnel and journalists is no different from the actions of the fascists and the arch-enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism.

Our comrades assisting in the economic construction of Albania, as well as our experts working in Korea, Cambodia, Ceylon, Burma, Afghanistan, Mali, Tanzania, Syria, Yemen, and Zanzibar, and our sports workers serving as coaches in Tunisia, have also sent letters or held meetings to express their warm regards to all comrades at our embassy in the Soviet Union and to strongly protest against the Soviet revisionist leadership!

They unanimously declared: "We may be killed, our blood may be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be discarded! We must be ready at any time to counter all imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries who dare to provoke us on the diplomatic front." (According to Xinhua News Agency)
