	The Asia-Africa Progressive Public Opinion Condemns the Soviet Revisionists' Class Revenge Against Our Students in Europe

	New Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, January 31st

	The Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Asia-Africa Association of Jurists issued a statement on January 31st in Conakry, strongly condemning the bloody suppression by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against Chinese students passing through Moscow.

	The statement said: "The bloody suppression of Chinese students passing through Moscow by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents is a mad fascist provocation by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against the great Chinese people. The atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique are not accidental. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, they have colluded with U.S. imperialism, mobilizing all their propaganda machines to attack and slander the great Chinese people and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The recent fascist crimes committed against Chinese youth are just another step in their dirty activities to sabotage the international communist movement."

	The statement pointed out that this heinous incident only shows that the Soviet revisionists harbor a deep hatred for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. "This is the class revenge of the international class enemy against the revolutionary people."

	The statement further said: "This bloody incident further exposes the treacherous nature of the small group of Soviet traitors who have betrayed the great Lenin, great Leninism, the Soviet people, the socialist cause, and the world revolution."

	The statement also listed numerous facts exposing the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against the liberation cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The statement pointed out: "All of this clearly shows to the peoples of the world that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has become a traitor to the liberation cause of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and other regions of the world."

	The statement concluded by expressing firm belief that the revolutionary peoples of all countries will surely defeat imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries.

	New Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 31st

	Four African nationalist parties issued statements on January 31st in Cairo, strongly condemning the bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and praising these Chinese students as "Chairman Mao's good students" who fearlessly face the atrocities of the revisionists and uphold the truth of Marxism-Leninism.

	The statement issued by the Botswana People's Party, signed by Bobbie Mark, a member of the National Executive Committee, pointed out that the unprovoked attack and savage beating of Chinese students is a fascist act that further exposes the true face of the Soviet revisionists. The statement said: "The revisionist ruling clique's arrogant behavior further shows how far the servants and lackeys of U.S. imperialism will go in their counter-revolutionary activities to please their masters."

	The statement continued: "Chinese students act according to the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, correctly applying it to actual situations. They are determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory. The statement praised: "They are Chairman Mao's good students."

	The statement said that the Botswana People's Party calls on all revolutionary and progressive people around the world to condemn the number one lackey of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionists.

	The statement of the Botswana People's Party concluded with the slogans: "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

	Representative Sitor of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, in his statement condemning the atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against Chinese students, said: "This extremely shocking event proves that the Soviet revisionist clique has taken fascist measures, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, and exposed their true face to the people of the world."

	The statement said that Chinese students have the right to read Chairman Mao's quotations because this is the truth of the revolution, so the Soviet revisionists are very afraid.

	The statement emphasized: "The internationalist actions of Chinese students are revolutionary actions. No matter how the revisionists try to sabotage the socialist revolution that the Chinese people are carrying out, the revisionists are sure to fail. We pay tribute to the Chinese students who are true Marxists-Leninists. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, their cause will surely achieve final victory."

	The deputy secretary-general of the Swaziland Progressive Party, Nkosi, said that the atrocities of the Soviet revisionist clique exposed their extremely ferocious and ugly face, exposed their erroneous line, and once again showed that the Soviet revisionists have colluded with U.S. imperialists.

	The statement said: "We pay the highest respect to the Chinese students who uphold Marxism."

	Representative Makoti of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) pointed out in condemning the actions of the Soviet revisionist clique against Chinese students: "All those who respect the immortal people's revolutionary heroes must resolutely condemn this action."

	The statement also said: "We extend warm greetings to the Chinese students who suffered the atrocities and pay tribute to their firm revolutionary spirit!"

    反修小将是毛主席的好学生
    亚非进步舆论声讨苏修对我留欧学生进行阶级报复
    新华社科纳克里三十一日电　亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处书记维扬托一月三十一日在科纳克里发表一项声明，强烈谴责苏联反革命修正主义统治集团对路过莫斯科的中国留欧学生的血腥镇压。
    声明说：“苏联军警和便衣特务对路过莫斯科的中国留欧学生的血腥镇压，是苏联反革命修正主义统治集团对伟大的中国人民的疯狂的法西斯挑衅。苏联修正主义统治集团的这种暴行绝不是偶然的。它自从中国开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，就同美帝国主义串通一气，开动了所有的宣传机器攻击和诬蔑伟大的中国人民和中国无产阶级文化大革命。最近对中国青年所犯下的法西斯罪行只是在它破坏国际共产主义运动的肮脏活动中的新的一步。”
    声明指出，这一罪恶事件只能表明，苏联修正主义者对中国文化大革命和光辉的毛泽东思想怀有刻骨的仇恨。“这是国际阶级敌人对革命人民的阶级报复。”
    声明又说：“这一血腥事件进一步暴露了已经背叛了伟大的列宁、伟大的列宁主义，背叛了苏联人民、社会主义事业和世界革命的一小撮苏联叛徒的反革命真面目。”
    声明还列举大量事实揭露苏联修正主义统治集团背叛亚非各国人民的解放事业。声明指出：“所有这一切向世界各国人民清楚表明，苏联修正主义统治集团已经成为背叛亚洲、非洲和世界其他地区各国人民解放事业的叛徒。”
    声明最后表示坚信各国革命人民必将战胜帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派。
    新华社开罗三十一日电　四个非洲民族主义政党一月三十一日在这里分别发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义统治集团血腥镇压中国留欧学生，并且称赞这些中国学生是“毛主席的好学生”，他们面对修正主义者的暴行而不惧，坚持马克思列宁主义真理。
    由贝专纳人民党全国执行委员会委员波比·马克签署的贝专纳人民党的声明指出，毫无道理地袭击和野蛮殴打中国学生“是法西斯行为，这种行为进一步暴露苏联修正主义者的真面目。修正主义统治集团的这种蛮横行为更清楚地说明，美帝国主义的仆从和走卒为了讨好他们的主子，在反革命活动方面会走得多么远。”
    声明接着说，中国学生照光辉的毛泽东思想办事，把毛泽东思想正确地运用于实际情况。他们下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。声明赞扬说：“他们是毛主席的好学生。”
    声明说，贝专纳人民党呼吁全世界革命的进步人民谴责美帝国主义者的头号帮凶苏联修正主义者。
    贝专纳人民党的声明最后高呼口号：“打倒现代修正主义”！“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    莫三鼻给革命委员会的代表西托尔在声明中谴责苏联修正主义统治集团镇压中国学生的暴行时说：“这一极为令人震惊的事件证明，苏联修正主义集团采取了法西斯措施，背弃了马克思列宁主义，在世界人民面前暴露了他们的真面目。”
    声明说，中国学生有权读毛主席语录，因为这是革命的真理，所以苏联修正主义者非常害怕。
    声明强调说：“中国学生的无产阶级国际主义行动是革命的行动。不管修正主义者怎样试图破坏中国人民正在进行的社会主义革命，修正主义者肯定要失败。我们向不愧为真正的马克思列宁主义者的中国学生致敬。在毛主席的领导下，他们的事业必将取得最后的胜利。
    斯威士兰进步党副总书记恩科西说，苏联修正主义集团的这一暴行暴露了他们十分狰狞和丑恶的面目，暴露了他们的错误路线，并再次表明，苏联修正主义者已同美帝国主义者同流合污了。
    声明说：“我们向维护马克思主义的中国学生致以崇高的敬意。”
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会的代表马科蒂在谴责苏联修正主义集团镇压中国学生的行动时指出：“所有对永垂不朽的人民革命英雄表示敬仰的人们都必须坚决谴责这一行动。”
    声明还说：“我们向遭受暴行的中国学生致以热情的问候，并且向他们的坚定的革命英雄气概致敬！”
