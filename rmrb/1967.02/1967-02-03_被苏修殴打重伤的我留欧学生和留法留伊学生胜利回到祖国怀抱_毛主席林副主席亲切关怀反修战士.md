Injured Chinese Students Studying in Europe and France Return to the Motherland

Mao Zedong and Lin Biao Personally Care for Anti-Revisionist Fighters

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport by revolutionary rebels and the masses of Beijing, as well as foreign friends, to welcome the Chinese students studying in Europe and France who were severely beaten by Soviet revisionists and returned to the motherland.

Vice Premier Chen Yi went to the airport to welcome them and praised the anti-revisionist fighters, saying, "You have fought very bravely."

An injured student with tears in his eyes said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao, thank you, the Party Central Committee. Please convey our greetings to Chairman Mao."

According to Xinhua News Agency on February 2nd, "Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The blood debts owed by the Soviet revisionists must be settled completely!" "The day when the Soviet people and revolutionary people around the world unite to seize power from this small group of reactionary revisionists is coming!" "The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high all over the world! Forever fly high!"

The revolutionary rebels and the masses of Beijing shouted these slogans today, resonating through the Beijing airport. With excited hearts, they warmly welcomed the Chinese students studying in Europe and France who were severely beaten by Soviet military police and returned to the side of our most beloved and respected great leader, Chairman Mao, overcoming numerous obstacles.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi went to the Beijing airport to welcome the glorious anti-revisionist fighters. Chen Yi, on behalf of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, expressed sincere condolences to the injured students. He said, "You have fought very bravely. You have returned victorious. I hope you will rest and recuperate well and recover your health as soon as possible."

The injured students, with tears in their eyes and choked voices, said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao, thank you, the Party Central Committee. Please convey our greetings to Chairman Mao." The glorious anti-revisionist fighters, with infinite happiness and immense excitement, shouted over and over again, "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our red sun, Chairman Mao!"

Thousands of revolutionary masses at the airport poured out their deep revolutionary friendship for the anti-revisionist fighters. They praised, "Our students are great! They spilled their blood on the Red Square in Moscow, spreading Mao Zedong Thought there, igniting the spark of revolution in the hearts of the Soviet people. They are absolutely right, and they did a great job!"

Today, the Beijing airport was adorned with red flags and the sound of drums. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses from various sectors of the capital, as well as foreign friends from more than thirty countries and regions, held up large portraits of Chairman Mao and banners, and carried a cartoon of "Hang Brezhnev and Kosygin" to the airport, giving a powerful demonstration to the evil Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

At around 4 PM, the special plane carrying the Chinese students landed at the airport. The Chinese students studying in Europe and Iraq carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held up the five-starred national flag, waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" as they stepped off the plane. The severely injured students Huang Jian, Chen Luku, and Liu Guanghui were carried off the plane on stretchers by medical personnel. They were seriously injured, in great pain, and had difficulty moving. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, they lay on the stretchers, tears streaming down their faces, and forcefully raised their hands to wave the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The other six injured students walked out of the cabin with the help of the crowd, each holding a "Quotations from Chairman Mao" tightly to their chests. Chen Yi and relevant officials walked to the side of the plane and shook hands with the anti-revisionist fighters one by one, expressing their sincere condolences.

The anti-revisionist fighters stood before the welcoming revolutionary masses, and the people waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together with the victorious comrades, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!"

The sixty Chinese students studying in Europe who had just returned to the capital also came to welcome their comrades. After the brave anti-revisionist fighters from various fronts gathered victoriously, they shook hands tightly and encouraged each other to actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, and resolutely rebel against imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Foreign friends from more than thirty countries and regions also waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Warmly welcome the anti-revisionist fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Learn from the strong anti-revisionist fighters of China!" They enthusiastically shook hands with the anti-revisionist comrades, expressing their warm greetings and determination to unite with the Chinese comrades to fight against American imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. After the entire crowd sang "The East Is Red," the welcoming people and the anti-revisionist fighters together held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read the teachings of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore our lost property on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand among the nations of the world." "This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice, of daring to fight and daring to win. It will press on under all difficulties and will never yield to the enemy no matter how strong it may be or how great the hardships it may encounter."

The representative of the revolutionary rebels of the capital first spoke, warmly praising the glorious anti-revisionist fighters for displaying the heroic spirit of overcoming all enemies and fighting to the end in the face of a small group of Soviet fascist thugs. He said, "Your blood is the blood of the Chinese people, the blood of revolutionary people around the world, and the blood of our revolutionary rebels! How can our blood be shed in vain? Blood debts must be repaid with blood!"

He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious.' Your blood was shed on the Red Square in Moscow. You spread Mao Zedong Thought and ignited the spark of revolution."

He said, "Listen, you Soviet thugs: the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The blood debts you owe, one by one, must be settled completely. Your heinous crimes will not be forgiven by the Soviet people. You wait and see! The day when the Soviet people and revolutionary people around the world unite to seize power from you, this small group of reactionaries, is coming. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high all over the world! Forever fly high!"

The nine severely injured students studying in Europe issued a written statement. The statement said, "We returned on the plane sent by Chairman Mao to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao." At this most happy moment, we are infinitely excited and deeply moved. We have a thousand words to express, and the first sentence is to wish our beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life, eternal life!

The written statement said, "The bloody crimes of the Soviet revisionists fully show that the Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed Lenin, betrayed the October Revolution, and betrayed the great Soviet people. In history, all traitors have met a bad end. We firmly believe that one day, the great banner of Leninism will once again fly over the Kremlin, and the great light of Mao Zedong Thought will surely shine all over the world."

The representative of the students studying in Iraq, Li Pengwang, said in his speech, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'To be opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' The Soviet thugs hate us, beat us, and we feel honored and comfortable. The enemy can injure our bodies, but they cannot shake our firm resolve to fight against imperialism and revisionism."

Li Pengwang said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Our victory is completely the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the credit goes to our beloved red sun, Chairman Mao."

The representative of the students studying in France, Liu Peilong, said in his speech, "We have finally returned to the side of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, returned to the capital of our great motherland. We are determined to throw ourselves into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with all our might, to defend Chairman Mao to the death, and to defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death. We must learn from the Red Guards and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." He finally shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our beloved red sun, Chairman Mao!"

After the welcoming ceremony ended, everyone sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "The Internationale" in unison. "We want to be the masters of the new society..." "Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought..." The revolutionary fighters' powerful voices echoed through the sky, shaking the earth.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Moscow on February 2nd, nine Chinese students studying in Europe who were severely beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents on January 25th on the Red Square in Moscow, as well as forty-nine Chinese students in Paris who were persecuted by French police, boarded a special plane of the Chinese Civil Aviation at dawn on February 2nd and left Moscow to return to China.

The acting head of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhiyuan, the acting military attaché, Lin Fengshan, embassy diplomats and staff, and dozens of Chinese students passing through Moscow on their way back to China went to the airport to give a warm send-off.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry staff, Zhang Dakai and Zeng Yuelan, who came with the special plane to receive the injured students, as well as two doctors and nurses who came to Moscow specially to treat the injured students, also returned to China with the plane.

The Chinese students who went to the airport to see them off read aloud in the airport waiting hall: "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism. This is an objective law independent of people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious." "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrible, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

When the glorious anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist fighters returned to China, they received unprecedented special "treatment" from the Soviet military police in Moscow.

As soon as the car carrying the Chinese students drove out of the embassy, a large number of police cars, police cars with loudspeakers, and small trucks that had been waiting around the embassy followed closely, never leaving their side. Soviet military police drove motorcycles in front to clear the way, and almost all the lights along the forty-kilometer route were green.

When the Chinese students arrived at the airport, the inside and outside were heavily guarded, with police stationed every three steps and five steps. The number of customs and border guards doubled, almost all of them were out. There were countless plainclothes "send-off people."

What was even more infuriating was that when the acting head of the Chinese Embassy, An Zhiyuan, and the acting military attaché, Lin Fengshan, arrived at the airport, the Soviet military police unreasonably did not allow them to enter the airport waiting hall. An Zhiyuan, the acting head of the embassy, immediately protested to the Soviet side, pointing out that this was an unreasonable act of discriminating against Chinese diplomatic personnel and restricting the activities of Chinese diplomats.

Chinese journalists were also only allowed to enter the waiting hall today, but not the airport. Chinese journalists also protested to the Soviet border guards on the spot.

    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志，前往首都机场迎接光荣的反修战士。陈毅同志代表毛主席、林副主席和周总理向受伤的同学表示亲切的慰问。他说：“你们斗争得很勇敢。你们胜利回来了。希望你们好好治疗休养，早日恢复健康。”
    受伤的同学，眼含热泪，哽咽着说：“感谢毛主席，感谢党中央，请转达我们对毛主席他老人家的问候。”光荣的反修战士们以无限幸福、无比激动的心情，一遍又一遍地高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    数千名革命群众在机场上倾注了他们对反修战士的深厚的革命友情。他们赞扬说：我们的留学生是好样的，他们把自己的鲜血洒在莫斯科红场上，在那里传播毛泽东思想，在苏联人民心中点燃革命的火种，真是做得对，干得好！
    今天，首都机场红旗招展，锣鼓震天。首都革命造反派和各界革命群众，以及来自三十多个国家和地区的外国朋友，高擎着巨幅毛主席像和标语牌，抬着
  “绞死勃列日涅夫、绞死柯西金”的漫画来到机场，热烈欢迎从反修前线归来的战友，向万恶的苏修统治集团又一次进行了强大的示威。
    下午四时许，载着我留学生的专机降落在机场。我留欧和留伊拉克学生捧着毛主席像，举着五星国旗，舞动着《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”走下飞机。身受重伤的黄建同、陈履奎、刘光辉三位同学，由医护人员用担架轻轻抬下飞机。他们伤势很重，伤处剧痛，行动困难。在人们的欢呼声中，他们躺在担架上，淌着热泪，用力伸出手来，向大家挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。另外六位受伤的同学在人们的搀扶下走出机舱，他们每个人都手捧《毛主席语录》，紧紧地贴在自己的胸前。陈毅同志和各有关方面负责人走到飞机旁，同反修战士们一一握手，表示亲切慰问。
    反修战士们来到欢迎的革命群众面前，人们挥动着《毛主席语录》，和胜利归来的战友们一起高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“革命无罪，造反有理！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”昨天刚刚回到首都的我六十名留欧学生，今天也来欢迎战友们。各路英勇的反修战士胜利会师以后，紧紧握手，互相勉励，要积极投身无产阶级文化大革命，努力在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，坚决造帝国主义的反，坚决造苏修的反，坚决造党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反。
    来自三十多个国家和地区的外国朋友，也挥动着《毛主席语录》高呼：“热烈欢迎用毛泽东思想武装起来的反修战士们！”“向中国坚强的反修战士学习！”他们热情地握住反修战友们的手，致以亲切问候，表示坚决要和中国战友们团结在一起，为打倒美帝和苏修进行共同的斗争。
    机场上举行了隆重的欢迎大会。全场齐唱《东方红》以后，欢迎的人们和反修战士一起手捧《毛主席语录》，朗读我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”
    首都革命造反派代表首先讲话，热烈赞扬光荣的反修战士在一小撮苏修法西斯暴徒面前，发扬了压倒一切敌人和同敌人血战到底的英雄气概。他说，你们流的是中国人民的鲜血，是世界革命人民的鲜血，是我们革命造反派的鲜血！我们的血怎么能白流呢？血债是要用血来偿还的！
    他说，毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”你们的血洒在莫斯科红场上，你们传播了毛泽东思想，你们点燃了革命火种。
    他说，苏修恶棍们听着：中国人民不是好惹的，你们欠下的一笔又一笔血债，一定要彻底清算，彻底偿还，你们犯下的滔天罪行，苏联人民是绝不会饶恕你们的，你们等着吧！苏联人民和全世界革命人民大联合，向你们这一小撮反动派夺权的日子就要来到了。毛泽东思想的红旗必将在全世界高高飘扬！永世飘扬！
    九位身受重伤的留欧学生发表了书面讲话。讲话中说，我们乘毛主席他老人家派来的飞机回来了，回到我们最最最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的身边来了。在这最幸福的时刻，我们无限兴奋，万分激动，我们有千言万语要倾诉，第一句话就是祝我们日夜想念的我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    书面讲话中说，苏修的血腥罪行充分说明了苏修领导集团背叛了列宁，背叛了十月革命，背叛了伟大的苏联人民。历史上一切叛徒都没有好下场。我们坚信，终有一天，伟大的列宁主义旗帜必将重新飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空，伟大的毛泽东思想的光芒定将普照全球。
    留伊拉克学生代表李鹏旺在讲话中说，毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”苏修恶棍仇视我们，打我们，我们感到很光荣，很舒服。敌人可以打伤我们的身体，但是丝毫不能动摇我们的反帝反修的坚强决心。
    李鹏旺说，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们的胜利，完全是毛泽东思想的胜利，胜利归功于我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    留法学生代表刘培龙在讲话中说，我们终于回到了最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边，回到了伟大祖国的首都。我们决心全力以赴地投入无产阶级文化大革命，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想。我们一定要向红卫兵学习，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他最后高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    欢迎大会结束后，全体齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《国际歌》。“我们要做新社会的主人……”“干革命靠的是毛泽东思想……”革命战士雄壮的歌声响彻云霄，震天动地。
    据新华社莫斯科二日电　一月二十五日在莫斯科红场遭受苏修军警和便衣特务殴打受重伤的九名中国留欧学生以及在巴黎受法国警察迫害的四十九名中国留法学生等，二日凌晨乘中国民航专机离开莫斯科回国。
    中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远、代理武官林峰山、大使馆外交官员和工作人员，以及数十名路经莫斯科回国的中国留学生代表前往机场热烈送行。
    随专机前来迎接受伤学生的中国外交部工作人员张大可、曾悦兰以及专程来莫斯科为受伤同学治疗的两位医生和护士也都随机回国。
    到机场送行的中国留学生在机场候机厅内齐声朗读毛主席语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”、“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    当光荣的反帝反修战士们回国时，在莫斯科受到了苏联军警史无前例的特殊“待遇”。
    当中国留学生乘坐的汽车刚驶出使馆，早已等候在使馆周围的大批警车、带扩音喇叭的警车、小卡车尾随跟踪，形影不离。苏联军警驾驶摩托车在前面开道，沿途四十多公里几乎一律开绿灯放行。
    当中国留学生抵达机场时，里里外外戒备森严，警察三步一哨，五步一岗；海关边防人员倍增，几乎倾巢出动。更有数不尽的身着便服的“送行人”。
    令人气愤的是，当中国大使馆临时代办安致远、代理武官林峰山等外交官员抵达机场时，苏联军警竟毫无道理地不让他们进入机场候机厅。安致远临时代办当即向苏方提出了抗议，指出，这是歧视中国外交人员和限制中国外交官员活动的无理行为。
    中国记者今天也只被允许进入候机厅，而不准进入机场，中国记者也当面向苏方边防人员提出了抗议。
