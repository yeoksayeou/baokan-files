The proletarian revolutionary faction must achieve victory in the struggle for power, and the key lies in achieving a broad unity. This unity must have the "three-in-one combination" of the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, the leaders of local garrison troops, and revolutionary cadres in party and government organs as its core. Currently, the primary issue in the "three-in-one combination" is correctly implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's policy on cadres.

In the question of how to deal with cadres, there are some incorrect ideas and practices in our proletarian revolutionary faction that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and must be promptly corrected.

In the current stage of the "three-in-one combination" for seizing power, there are clearly revolutionary cadres who have passed the test of the movement, but they are not distinguished between proletarian cadres in power and those who take the capitalist road, and the practice of "all cadres in power step aside" is adopted. This is a pseudo-leftist and rightist view and practice. The essence of this understanding and practice is to oppose everything, exclude everything, and overthrow everything. Under the influence of this ideology, when revolutionary faction comrades investigate and understand the situation, if they consult with revolutionary cadres, it is said to be "taking the upper-level route"; if a proletarian revolutionary organization has revolutionary cadres participating or has contact with revolutionary cadres, it is condemned as "royalist" without asking the reason, or it is said to have "backstage directors." As a result, many comrades are afraid to get involved with cadres, dare not unite with revolutionary cadres to seize power, and dare not unite with those cadres who, although they made some mistakes in the past, are not "three-anti" elements and can correct their mistakes and return to Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every cadre must be examined and assessed, but this does not mean that all cadres in power cannot be trusted and should be overthrown.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Cadres must also be analyzed in terms of class, to see whether they are enemies or our own people. Then, based on specific circumstances, they should be treated differently. For those who firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and take the socialist road, we should trust them, support them, and support their participation in the "three-in-one combination" leadership core. Revolutionary cadres are precious assets of the party and the people, and their role in the struggle for power must be sufficiently valued.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres." We proletarian revolutionaries must distinguish between the three and four types of cadres mentioned in the "Sixteen Points," and we must not confuse enemy contradictions with contradictions among the people, nor should we treat contradictions among the people as enemy contradictions. Otherwise, it will confuse the lines and be exploited by the enemy.

For cadres who have made general or serious mistakes, or who have implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as long as they are not stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, in general, the contradictions between these cadres and the party and the people are not enemy contradictions but contradictions among the people. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and adopt the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the person," and "unite-criticize-unite," to help them, educate them, and reform them. When they stand up to expose the crimes of those in power who take the capitalist road within the party, we proletarian revolutionaries should encourage them and support them. The practice of "overthrowing all cadres in power" and "overthrowing all cadres" is not in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao says: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party. All levels of leadership must pay full attention and must not be careless." We proletarian revolutionaries listen to Chairman Mao the most, and we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, distinguish between enemies and friends, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and severely strike down the handful of cadres within the party who take the capitalist road. Through the movement, ultimately unite more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres. In this way, we can forever stand unshakable.

    敢于和革命的领导干部结合
    志峰
    无产阶级革命派要取得夺权斗争的胜利，关键在于实现广泛的大联合。这种大联合，必须以革命群众组织的负责人、当地驻军的负责人和党政机关的革命领导干部的“三结合”为核心。当前，“三结合”的首要问题，就是正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。
    在如何对待干部这个问题上，我们无产阶级革命派队伍中，有一些不符合毛泽东思想的想法和作法，必须迅速纠正。
    在当前“三结合”夺权的阶段，明明经过运动的考验，有可以联合的革命领导干部，却不去区分是无产阶级当权派还是走资本主义道路当权派，实行“当权派统统靠边站”，这是一种形“左”实右的看法和作法。这种认识和作法的实质，就是反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切。有些人在这种思想的影响下，对于革命派的战士调查了解情况的时候，如果找了革命领导干部，就说是“走上层路线”；一个无产阶级革命派的组织如果有革命领导干部参加或者和革命领导干部有联系，便不问情由，斥为“保皇”，或者说是“有幕后指挥人”。结果，不少同志怕沾“保皇”的边，不敢和领导干部接触，不敢同革命领导干部联合夺权，不敢去团结那些过去虽有一些错误，但不是“三反”分子，并能检查改正，回到毛主席的革命路线上来的领导干部。
    在文化大革命中，要对每个干部进行审查和考核，但这绝不是说凡是当权派就不能相信，就该打倒。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”对于干部也要进行阶级分析，看他究竟是敌人，还是自己人。然后根据具体情况，区别对待。对于坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边、走社会主义道路的当权派，我们就要相信他，拥护他，支持他参加“三结合”的领导核心。革命的领导干部是党和人民的宝贵财富，必须足够地重视他们在夺权斗争中的作用。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。”我们无产阶级革命派要注意把“十六条”中所说的三类、四类干部区别开来，不可以把敌我矛盾当成人民内部矛盾，也不能把人民内部矛盾看作敌我矛盾。否则，就会搅乱阵线，为敌人所利用。
    对于犯有一般错误甚至严重错误，或者在文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线的干部，只要不是坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在一般情况下，这些干部同党和人民的矛盾，还不是敌我矛盾，而是人民内部矛盾。对他们，必须遵照毛主席的教导，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，帮助他们，教育他们，改造他们。当他们起来揭发那些党内走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶的时候，我们无产阶级革命派应当鼓励他们，支持他们。“打倒一切当权派”，对所有干部一律“打倒”的作法，是不符合毛泽东思想的。
    毛主席说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”我们无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，我们要最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，分清敌我友，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部。这样，我们就能永远立于不败之地。
