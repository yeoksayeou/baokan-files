As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country deepens, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's anti-China activities have become increasingly brazen, "escalating step by step." They blatantly, time and again, commit heinous anti-China atrocities in the birthplace of the October Revolution!

Why are the new tsars of the Kremlin so panic-stricken, mobilizing military police and secret agents to launch violent attacks?

It is because the 700 million people of red China are carrying out a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This irresistible revolutionary storm will thoroughly smash all old systems, uproot revisionism; it will awaken all oppressed peoples and launch the final assault on the old world.

Seeing this, they are terrified!

Thus, they are in a frenzy of anti-China hysteria, madly provoking the great people of China!

"The ant climbs the paulownia tree and boasts of its size, how easy is it for the antlion to shake a tree."

The axe cannot chop down the truth. Like all reactionaries in history, the clubs and axes wielded by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique will ultimately fall on their own heads. Their frenzy today proves their extreme weakness.

Again and again they cause trouble, again and again they incur blood debts; wave after wave of evil winds, step by step towards doom—Soviet revisionist demons will soon report to their fascist forebear, Hitler!

"Paper boats and candles burn in the sky." One day, the Soviet people will rise up in rebellion and overthrow this small clique of plague carriers!

    蚍蜉撼树谈何易
    驱虎豹
    随着我国无产阶级文化大革命的逐步深入，苏修统治集团的反华活动变本加厉，“逐步升级”。他们公然在十月革命的故乡，一次又一次地干出了骇人听闻的反华暴行！
    克里姆林宫的新沙皇为什么如此惊慌失措，出动军警特务大打出手？
    不是别的，就因为七亿人口的红色中国，正在开展轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。这场不可阻挡的革命风暴，将要彻底砸烂一切旧制度，把修正主义连根拔掉；将要唤醒一切被压迫的人民，向旧世界发动最后的冲击。
    此情此景，他们怕得要命！
    于是，他们反华的歇斯底里大发作，向伟大的中国人民进行疯狂的挑衅！
      “蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”
    斧头是砍不倒真理的。和历史上一切反动派一样，苏修统治集团所挥舞的棍棒斧头，最终将落在自己的头上。他们今日的百倍疯狂证明他们的万分虚弱。
    一次又一次捣乱，一笔又一笔血债；一阵阵刮起妖风，一步步走向灭亡——苏修恶魔到法西斯主义的祖师爷希特勒那里去报到的日子已经为期不远了！
      “纸船明烛照天烧。”总有一天，苏联人民将起来造反，将把苏修统治集团这一小撮瘟神掀倒！
