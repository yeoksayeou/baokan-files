The spring thunder roars across the sky, the earth dances with the east wind, battle hymns rise up, and the revolutionary torrent surges forward. The red storm of the "January Revolution" sweeps across our land. The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat have joined the great struggle for power! Shout with joy! Look—

The Huangpu River in Shanghai is surging with rolling spring tides; the red banners of the Taihang Mountains are held high, and Shanxi Province has regained its fighting spirit; Qingdao, Heilongjiang, Guizhou—one after another, red regimes are reborn in the revolutionary storm! See the rising red sun, dispelling layer upon layer of mist; see the blazing flames, burning down the magic palaces of the old world! We rise up in rebellion, fearless and merciless, seizing back all the power of the party, government, economy, and culture into the hands of the people! We are loyal and devoted, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought; we are passionate, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the public! We grow in the revolutionary storm, and in struggle, we forge ourselves into towering heroes!

The spring thunder has sounded, this is the call to advance for the revolution; the spring thunder has sounded, this is the death knell for the old world! The sun rises, the earth turns red, revolutionary rebel comrades, charge forward into the storm! All reactionary fortresses will be shaken down by the earth-shattering thunder, and a bright red new world will be born in the rumbling spring thunder!

  雄！春雷响了，这是革命的进军号；春雷响了，这是旧世界的丧钟！朝阳升起，大地染红，革命造反派战友们，迎着暴风雨冲锋！一切反动的堡垒，将被惊天动地的雷声震塌，一个红彤彤的新世界啊，将在隆隆的春雷声中诞生！
