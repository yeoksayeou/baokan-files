Supporting the Power Seizure Struggle at the Taiyuan Textile Factory: A Lecture Meeting of a Communication Construction Team

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 13 — The communication construction team of a certain unit, which participated in supporting the revolutionary rebel faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, to seize power, held a lecture meeting after the power seizure struggle was victorious. The following are some of the speeches made by the comrades.

The Fundamental Issue of Revolution is the Issue of Power

New soldier Chen Xianjiang: Participating in supporting the revolutionary rebel faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory to seize power has deepened my understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings on the fundamental issue of revolution being the issue of power. The Taiyuan Textile Factory was built during China's Second Five-Year Plan. A small clique of those in power within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, who were taking the capitalist road, sent their trusted followers to seize all the power within the factory, turning a socialist enterprise into a small kingdom ruled by the bourgeoisie. After the Cultural Revolution began, this small clique of those in power who were taking the capitalist road immediately organized attacks on some revolutionary comrades who exposed their crimes, labeling them as "anti-party elements," "fake leftists, true rightists," "extortionists," "ambitious individuals," and so on. The royalist faction they controlled had money, cars, and loudspeakers, while the activities of the revolutionary rebel faction faced countless obstacles, sometimes even unable to get paper for writing big-character posters. They also set up secret courts and hired thugs to suppress and persecute revolutionary masses. Why was it like this? It was because they held power. This time, the revolutionary left seized power, and the revolutionary masses truly became the masters. Who holds power is indeed a matter of life and death!

Cook Dai Shudang: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, trying to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." Since liberation, the overthrown class enemies have not slept a day, attempting to seize back the power they lost from the proletariat and restore capitalism. Indeed, in some places and departments, power has been usurped by them. The Taiyuan Textile Factory is a living example. A small clique of those in power within this factory, who were taking the capitalist road, used various tactics during the movement. They spread rumors, deceived and misled the masses, organized royalist factions, incited masses to fight against masses, and even beat and detained people. All of this was to preserve their power. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The reactionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." The revolutionary masses of the Taiyuan Textile Factory, following Chairman Mao's teachings, displayed the spirit of "daring to pull the emperor off his throne" and tenaciously fought to seize power from the small clique of those in power who were taking the capitalist road. Now, they have successfully seized the power. We cheer for their victory. However, the enemy will not be willing to give up. They will certainly continue to cause trouble and attempt to seize power again. The revolutionary left faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory still faces the arduous task of consolidating power. We must continue to support the revolutionary left. Whatever they need, we will support them, and we must firmly keep the power in the hands of the true revolutionary left.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Most Powerful Weapon in the Power Seizure Struggle

Team Leader Qiu Gang: From this struggle to support the rebel faction to seize power, I have further felt that the most powerful weapon is not cannons, machine guns, tanks, or atomic bombs. Our most powerful weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. A small clique of those in power within the party who were taking the capitalist road is very cunning. They waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, deceiving some uninformed masses to protect themselves. After we arrived at the factory, we read to the masses Chairman Mao's quotations: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Whoever only stands on the side of the revolutionary people in words but acts differently is a revolutionary in words only. If one stands on the side of the revolutionary people both in words and actions, he is a complete revolutionary." We also listed many facts of the reactionary organizations controlled by those in power who were taking the capitalist road, directing the struggle against the revolutionary masses, violating the Sixteen Points, engaging in armed struggles, and inciting strikes and stoppages. This made many comrades see clearly who the revolutionary left is, who the royalists are, who is revolutionary, and who is counter-revolutionary. Subsequently, we brought out the captured counter-revolutionaries from the basement, the confiscated weapons, and the looted property for public display, and repeatedly propagated the policies of the Cultural Revolution to the masses. This made some deceived masses awaken and take off the armbands of the royalists, standing on the side of the revolutionary faction. The facts have proven that the vast majority of the masses want revolution. As long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to do political and ideological work among them and raise their class consciousness, the enemy's disguise will be torn off, and they will reveal their true colors under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

Soldier Yang Chunheng: Chairman Mao said: "We must believe in the masses, and we must believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." In this struggle to support the revolutionary left to seize power, we firmly remembered these two principles, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses from beginning to end. As soon as we arrived at the factory gate, we saw thousands of outsiders, and we organized them through propaganda, establishing a blockade line around the factory to prevent bad elements from entering and exiting. After entering the factory, we immediately contacted the revolutionary left and organized a unified command structure. With the support of the broad revolutionary masses, we quickly controlled key points, occupied the enemy's nests, captured counter-revolutionaries, and finally, the broad masses of the revolutionary left advanced victoriously, seizing power in one fell swoop. These victories were completely due to the power of the masses. This reminded me of Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries." The revolutionary rebel faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory started with only a few dozen people. As soon as they appeared, they were attacked and suppressed, but they became stronger and stronger. On January 23, the rightist organization destroyed their headquarters, captured their people, and attempted to suppress them. However, they were not frightened but sang the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and held a grand march and demonstration, frightening the small clique of those in power who were taking the capitalist road. Why could they do this? It was because they grasped the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Through these facts, I deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for supporting the revolutionary left to seize power. In the future, I will definitely redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works and work hard on the "application" to first become a firm revolutionary leftist. Only in this way can I more effectively support the revolutionary left's power seizure struggle.

The People's Army Pledges to Be a Strong Backbone for the Revolutionary Rebels

Squad Leader Zhu Genwen: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary armed group executing political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting. In addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military force, it also has to bear the heavy tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary power, and even establishing the organization of the Communist Party." At the critical moment of the power seizure struggle at the Taiyuan Textile Factory, how could the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, stand by and do nothing? The affairs of the revolutionary rebels are our affairs. It is only natural for us to stand up and support the left to seize power. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has always been a revolutionary rebel faction. In the past, we rebelled against the three great enemies and fought for a new China; now we will support the revolutionary left to rebel against the small clique of those in power within the party who were taking the capitalist road, to protect our iron-clad proletarian state.

Squad Leader Chen Yinzuo: "Power comes from the barrel of a gun," this is a great truth. Chairman Mao said: "Anything reactionary that you do not overthrow will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." The small clique of those in power within the party at the Taiyuan Textile Factory, who were taking the capitalist road, seized the party and government power and concentrated the militia weapons in the hands of their trusted followers, sharpening their knives towards the revolutionary rebels. We revolutionary people must wield the iron broom to sweep them all away. As soon as our troops moved out, the arrogance of the small clique of counter-revolutionary rascals at the Taiyuan Textile Factory was immediately suppressed. The three iron doors with electric currents were opened by us, the weapons were confiscated by us, the counter-revolutionary organizations were destroyed, and the extremely evil counter-revolutionaries had to surrender. The revolutionary rebels raised their heads and seized all the party, government, financial, and cultural powers. We must not be lenient with the enemy because leniency towards the enemy is a crime against the people!

Squad Leader Bai Jinhai: Chairman Mao said: "Let the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters all come out, while our cadres do nothing, and many of them even do not distinguish between the enemy and us, colluding with the enemy, being corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, divided and disintegrated, pulled out and pushed in, many workers, peasants, and intellectuals are also treated by the enemy with both soft and hard methods, and if this is done, then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years, or a few dozen years, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." In the past, I did not fully understand this part of Chairman Mao's words, always thinking that class struggle exists, but can fleas topple the bed? Through participating in supporting the revolutionary rebel faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory to seize power, I was greatly shocked. We saw the scene of the destroyed headquarters of the leftist organization; we saw the knives and daggers hidden by the rascals in the basement; we saw the imprisoned revolutionary masses, which was shocking. Isn't the Taiyuan Textile Factory a unit that has changed color? If we all do nothing, then in a not too long time, it will indeed lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. In that case, the blood of the martyrs will have been shed in vain, history will regress, and the heads of thousands of people will fall, which is a very dangerous thing!

Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

Complete the Mission Assigned by History

Political Instructor Yu Junquan: The editorial of the third issue of the "Red Flag" magazine, "On the Power Seizure Struggle of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction," highly evaluates the army's support for the proletarian revolutionary faction to seize power at the critical moment, which is a great encouragement and a great impetus for us. We must hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest great instructions that the army should actively support the broad masses of the left, better carry forward the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army in doing mass work, more actively support the struggle of the revolutionary left, and always maintain the most red flag of the People's Liberation Army, completing the mission assigned by history. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Our Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of mass struggle, and this world is the great world of mass struggle." This time, I and everyone together received great education in supporting the revolutionary rebel faction of the Taiyuan Textile Factory to seize power, and my thoughts have been elevated. I will definitely continue to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat even better. We must consciously temper ourselves in the great winds and waves of class struggle, and while transforming the objective world, better transform the subjective world, making ourselves into a firm revolutionary fighter.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极支援革命左派的夺权斗争
    ——支援太原纺织厂夺权斗争的某部通信架设连的一次讲用会
    据新华社太原十三日电　参加支援山西省太原市纺织厂革命造反派夺权斗争的某部通信架设连，在夺权斗争胜利后，干部战士重温了毛主席关于政权问题的论述，召开了讲用会。下面是一部分同志的发言。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题
    新战士陈先江：这次参加支援太原纺织厂革命造反派的夺权斗争，使我进一步理解了毛主席关于革命的根本问题是政权问题的教导。太原纺织厂是我国第二个五年计划期间建成的新厂。山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，派遣了他们的亲信，窃取了厂内的一切大权，把一个社会主义企业变成了一个实行资产阶级统治的小王国。文化大革命开始后，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派对起来揭发他们罪行的一些革命同志，立刻组织围攻，把这些革命同志打成“反党分子”，“假左派、真右派”，“伸手派”，“野心家”等等。他们操纵下的保皇派，要钱有钱，要车有车，要扩音器有扩音器；而革命造反派的一切活动，却遭到百般刁难，有时连写大字报的纸都领不到。他们还私设刑堂，豢养打手，镇压、迫害革命群众。为什么会这样？就是因为他们手里有权。这次革命左派夺了权，革命群众才真正当家作主。政权掌握在谁手里，的的确确是个比天还大的大问题啊！
    炊事员代树堂：毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”解放以来，被打倒了的阶级敌人一天也没睡觉，妄想从无产阶级手中夺回他们失去的权力，复辟资本主义。的确也有一些地方、一些部门的权被他们篡夺了。太原纺织厂就是活生生的例子。这个厂的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在运动中耍了种种手段。他们刮阴风，造谣言，欺骗蒙蔽群众，组织保皇派，挑动群众斗群众，甚至打人扣人。这一切，无非是要保住他们的权。毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”太原纺织厂的革命群众遵照毛主席这一教导，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的精神，百折不挠地向那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。现在，他们已经胜利地把大权夺过来了。我们为他们的胜利而欢呼。但是，敌人是不会甘心的，他们必然还要继续捣乱，企图把权重新夺回去。太原纺织厂革命左派组织，还面临着巩固政权的艰巨任务。我们一定要继续支持革命左派，他们需要什么，我们就支援什么，一定要把大权牢牢地掌握在真正的革命左派手中。
    毛泽东思想是夺权斗争的最强大武器
    连长裘钢：从这次支援革命造反派夺权斗争中，我进一步感到：最强大的武器不是大炮、机关枪，不是坦克、原子弹，我们最强大的武器是毛泽东思想。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，是非常狡猾的。他们打着红旗反红旗，蒙蔽一部分不明真相的群众保护自己。我们到了工厂后，就向群众朗读毛主席语录：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。”并列举了许多走资本主义道路的当权派控制的反动组织把斗争矛头指向革命群众，违反十六条，进行武斗，挑动罢工停产等等事实，使许多同志认清了谁是革命左派，谁是保皇派，谁是革命的，谁是反革命的。随后，我们又把从地下室中捕获的反革命分子、缴获的凶器以及他们抢劫来的财物拿出来示众，并向大家反复宣传了文化大革命的政策。这就使一些受蒙蔽的群众觉悟过来，纷纷扯下了保皇派的袖章，站到革命派方面。事实证明，绝大部分群众是要革命的，只要用毛泽东思想去向他们进行政治思想工作，提高他们的阶级觉悟，敌人的画皮就会被剥掉，就会在毛泽东思想的阳光之下现出原形。
    战士杨春恒：毛主席说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”在这次支持革命左派夺权的斗争中，我们牢牢记住了这两条原理，自始至终相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众。我们一到工厂门口，看到数以千计的外厂群众，我们就通过宣传，把他们组织起来，在工厂周围建立了一道封锁线，防止坏人进出。进厂后，立即与革命左派联系，组织了统一指挥机构。在广大革命群众的支持下，我们迅速控制了要点，占领了黑窝，捕获了反革命分子。最后，革命左派的广大群众乘胜前进，一举夺了权。这些胜利的取得，完全是由于群众的力量。这使我想起毛主席的教导：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”太原纺织厂的革命造反派，一开始只有几十个人，它一出现就受到围攻、打击，但是它却越战越强。一月二十三日，右派组织捣毁了他们的总部，抓了他们的人，企图把他们镇压下去，可是他们不但没有被吓倒，反而高唱毛主席语录歌，举行了声势浩大的游行示威，吓破了走资本主义道路当权派的胆。他们为什么能这样，就是因为他们掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。通过这些事实，我深刻认识到，毛泽东思想是我们支援革命左派夺权斗争最强大的武器。我今后一定要加倍努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，首先使自己成为一个坚定的革命左派。这样，才能更有效地支援革命左派的夺权斗争。
    人民军队誓作革命造反派的坚强后盾
    班长朱根文：毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”在太原纺织厂的夺权斗争十分紧急的关键时刻，作为无产阶级专政柱石的中国人民解放军，怎么能不管不问？革命造反派的事就是我们的事。我们挺身出来支持左派夺权是理所当然的事。中国人民解放军在毛主席的领导下，从来就是一个革命造反派，过去我们造了三大敌人的反，打出了一个新中国；现在我们要支持革命左派造一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，保住我们无产阶级的铁打江山。
    班长陈因锁：“枪杆子里面出政权”，这是伟大的真理。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”太原纺织厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派窃取了党政大权，还把民兵武器集中在他们的亲信手中，磨刀霍霍向着革命造反派。我们革命人民就要挥起铁扫帚大扫特扫，把它们统统扫掉。我们部队一出动，太原纺织厂的一小撮反革命坏蛋的嚣张气焰立即被压下去，里外三道通上电流的铁门被我们打开了，凶器被我们缴下来了，反革命组织被摧毁了，罪大恶极的反革命分子只得俯首就擒。革命造反派扬眉吐气，把党、政、财、文等大权统统夺了过来。对敌人就是不能客气，因为对敌人仁慈，就是对人民犯罪！
    班长白金海：毛主席说：“让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”过去我对毛主席的这一段话理解不够深，总觉得阶级斗争有是有，但跳蚤还能顶得起被窝？通过参加支援太原纺织厂革命造反派的夺权斗争，我大大吃了一惊。我们看到了被砸毁的左派组织总部的现场；看到了坏家伙们窝藏在地下室里的刀子、匕首；看到了被囚禁的革命群众，真是惊心怵目。太原纺织厂不就是一个改变了颜色的单位吗？如果我们大家都不管不问，照此办理，那么，在一个不太长的时间内，确实会出现全国性的反革命复辟。那样，烈士的鲜血就会白流，历史就要倒退，成千万人民的头就会落地，这是多么危险的事情呀！
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    完成历史赋予我们的使命
    指导员于俊泉：《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》，对部队在关键时刻支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争给予的评价，是对我们极大的鼓舞，也是对我们极大的鞭策。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行毛主席关于军队应该积极支持左派广大群众的最新伟大指示，更好地发扬人民解放军做群众工作的优良传统，更积极地支持革命左派的斗争，永远保持我们人民解放军的最鲜红的旗帜，完成历史赋予我们的使命。毛主席早就教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”这次我和大家一起，在支援太原纺织厂革命造反派的夺权斗争中受到了很大教育，思想有了提高。我一定要继续遵照毛主席的教导，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。我们一定要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中自觉地锻炼自己，要在改造客观世界的同时，更好地改造主观世界，使自己成为一个坚强的革命战士。
