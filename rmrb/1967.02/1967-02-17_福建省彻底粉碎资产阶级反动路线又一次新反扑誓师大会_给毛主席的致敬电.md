Fujian Province's Rally to Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line Sends a Message of Salutation to Chairman Mao

	Fujian Province's rally to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line sends a message of salutation to Chairman Mao. The full text is as follows:

	Dearest and most respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	At this crucial moment when we are enthusiastically responding to your call to learn from the revolutionary experiences of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary faction, to unite the proletarian revolutionary factions, and to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the class enemy is once again brazenly carrying out new sabotage activities. As you have taught us, "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." You have instructed the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the left, to achieve great unity, to carry out the great struggle to seize power, and to strengthen preparations for war. However, a handful of power-holders within the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fuzhou Municipal Committee who are taking the capitalist road, in order to retain their control over the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers, have colluded with the ghosts and monsters in society, spread poisonous winds, set off ghost fires, distorted right and wrong, confused is and isn't, spread rumors and slander, diverted the direction of the struggle, directed the spearhead of the struggle against the People's Liberation Army, and attempted to sabotage the powerful tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals. They incited a group of misled masses to successively attack the meeting of active members representing the study of Chairman Mao's works by the Fuzhou troops and the command organ of the Fuzhou troops. After your forwarding of the January 28th order from the Central Military Commission and the Military Commission's forwarding of the "Notice from the Frontline Troops in Fujian," they went into a hysterical frenzy, using the propaganda tools they had usurped to carry out frenzied counter-revolutionary propaganda; using some mass organizations they had infiltrated, they manipulated some misled masses to stage counter-revolutionary rallies and parades, viciously attacking the People's Liberation Army's support for the revolutionary left's struggle to seize power, attacking the Central Military Commission, and firing cannons at the headquarters of the proletariat. After their counter-revolutionary plot was exposed, they created rumors and chaos, and for a time, the reactionary momentum was rampant.

	The revolutionary people of the old revolutionary base areas in Fujian have been clear-cut and firm in their stance during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making the Fujian Provincial counter-revolutionary revisionist clique tremble with fear. Thus, while directing the spearhead of the struggle against the Liberation Army, they furiously suppressed the revolutionary masses of the old base areas, cursing the revolutionary organizations of the old base areas as "counter-revolutionary organizations." They created various pretexts to want to put revolutionary leading cadres who insist on the proletarian revolutionary line and firmly support the revolutionary left to death! They launched a frenzied attack and persecution on revolutionary organizations that firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and steadfastly support the proletarian revolutionary line, calling them the new "royalists" and wanting to bring them down. These reactionary acts are the bourgeois reactionary line's all-out counterattack in our province!

	However, this counter-revolutionary plot was quickly seen through by the revolutionary rebels. The Red Guards of the "August 29th" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters in Fujian Province, under your and the Party Central Committee's warm care, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, armed with the "Sixteen Points" and the editorial of the third issue of "Red Flag" magazine, have displayed the dauntless spirit of daring to charge, fight, struggle, rebel, and make revolution since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They stood up first to defend the proletarian revolutionary line, withstanding this evil wind. Revolutionary workers, peasants, cadres, and Red Guard comrades united, fought bravely, and won victory after victory. These are new victories of your brilliant thoughts!

	In this battle to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, especially the brave frontline troops, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, firmly carried out your brilliant instructions, stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary left, supported the revolutionary young heroes of "August 29th" and other revolutionary leftists, launched a powerful political offensive, resolutely suppressed the enemy's counter-revolutionary momentum, educated and won over the deceived masses, and together with all revolutionary mass organizations, repelled this counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The relationship between the military and the people has become even closer in the struggle, and the prestige of the People's Liberation Army has been further enhanced!

	Various revolutionary rebel factions have been tempered in this struggle. Now we are more united and stronger. The broad masses of revolutionaries have been educated in this stage of class struggle, their class consciousness has been raised, their understanding of the bourgeois reactionary line has deepened, and the ranks of the revolutionary left have rapidly expanded. As you have taught us, bad things have turned into good things.

	Dearest Chairman Mao, we will definitely follow your teachings: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We will definitely thoroughly criticize and expose the bourgeois reactionary trend, expose the plotters behind this counterattack! Implement the dictatorship of the proletariat! Nothing can be established without destruction, and nothing can flow without obstruction. Only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing the bourgeois reactionary line can we implement the proletarian revolutionary line; only by smashing counter-revolutionary splittist activities can we achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Fujian Province is entering a new stage of great unity and great seizure of power by the revolutionary left. The revolutionary situation is excellent! The proletarian revolutionary factions are advancing victoriously along the direction you have pointed out!

	Dearest Chairman Mao, we love you immensely! We are forever loyal to you! For the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for the defense of your brilliant thoughts, for the red flag to fly all over the world, we are willing to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, shed blood, and make sacrifices!

	We wish you, dearest Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    福建省彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑誓师大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社福州十六日电　福建省彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑誓师大会给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    正当我们热烈响应您的号召，学习上海无产阶级革命派的革命经验，使无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权的重要关头，阶级敌人又猖狂地进行新的破坏活动。正如您老人家教导的那样：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”您老人家指示人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众，实行大联合，进行大夺权斗争和加强战备，而福建省委和福州市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了保住他们所霸占的党、政、财、文大权，伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，煽阴风，点鬼火，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，造谣污蔑，转移斗争大方向，把斗争矛头指向中国人民解放军，妄图破坏强大的无产阶级专政的工具，以达到他们反革命的目的。他们煽动一批不明真相的群众，先后冲击福州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会和福州部队指挥机关。在您批转的一月二十八日中央军委命令和军委批转《福建前线部队公告》之后，他们更是歇斯底里地大发作，利用他们所篡夺的宣传工具，疯狂地进行反革命宣传；利用被他们打进去了的某些群众组织，操纵不明真相的某些群众，策划了反革命集会、游行，恶毒攻击人民解放军支持革命左派的夺权斗争，攻击中央军委，炮打无产阶级司令部。当他们这个反革命阴谋被揭穿之后，又制造谣言，制造混乱，一时反动气焰嚣张。
    福建老区革命人民，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，使得福建省反革命修正主义集团胆战心惊。于是他们在把斗争矛头指向解放军的同时，疯狂地镇压老区革命群众，咒骂老区革命组织是“反革命组织”。他们制造各种借口，要将坚持无产阶级革命路线、坚决支持革命左派的革命领导干部置于死地！对紧紧掌握斗争大方向、坚定地拥护无产阶级革命路线的革命组织，进行疯狂的围攻、迫害，骂他们是新的“保皇派”，要把他们打下去。他们这些反动行为，是资产阶级反动路线在我省的又一次全面大反扑！
    但是他们这个反革命的阴谋很快就被革命造反派识破了。福建省“八·二九”革命造反总司令部的红卫兵战士，在您和党中央的亲切关怀之下，在人民解放军的大力支援之下，以《十六条》和《红旗》杂志第三期社论为武器，发扬了无产阶级文化大革命开始以来的敢冲、敢打、敢拚、敢革命、敢造反的大无畏的精神，首先站出来保卫无产阶级革命路线，顶住这一股妖风。革命的工人、农民、机关干部、红卫兵战友，联合起来，英勇奋战，夺取一个又一个胜利。这是您老人家光辉思想的一个个新胜利！
    在这次击退资产阶级反动路线新反扑的战斗中，特别是英勇的前线部队广大指战员，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行您老人家的英明指示，坚定地站在革命左派一边，支持“八·二九”的革命小将和其他革命左派，开展强大的政治攻势，坚决打击敌人的反革命气焰，教育和争取了受蒙骗的群众，同一切革命群众组织一起击退了这一次资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。军民的关系在斗争中更加密切了，人民解放军的威信更提高了！
    各革命造反派在这一斗争中得到了新的锻炼。现在我们更加团结了，更加坚强了。广大的革命群众在这一阶段的阶级大搏斗中受到了教育，提高了阶级觉悟，对资产阶级反动路线的认识更加深刻了，革命左派的队伍迅速壮大。正如您老人家教导的那样，坏事变成了好事。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们一定按照您的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要把资产阶级反动思潮彻底批倒、批臭，把这次反扑的幕后策划者揪出来！实行无产阶级专政！不破不立，不塞不流，只有大破资产阶级反动路线，才能实行无产阶级革命路线；只有粉碎反革命的分裂活动，才能进行无产阶级革命派的大联合。目前福建省的无产阶级文化大革命正在进入一个革命左派大联合、大夺权的新阶段，革命的形势好得很！无产阶级革命派正沿着您指引的方向胜利地前进着！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们无限热爱您！我们永远忠于您！为无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利、为保卫您的光辉思想、为红旗遍全球，我们上刀山、下火海、流血牺牲，在所不惜！
    敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    福建省彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑誓师大会
                                      一九六七年二月十一日
