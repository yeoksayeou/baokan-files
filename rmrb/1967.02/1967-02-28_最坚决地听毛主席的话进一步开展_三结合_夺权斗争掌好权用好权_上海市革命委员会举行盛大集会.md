The current storm of the January Revolution is sweeping across the nation, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is presenting a great situation. At this critical moment of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued many extremely important directives regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai have drawn immense inspiration and drawn boundless strength from these directives. They solemnly vow: to resolutely follow the words of our great leader Chairman Mao, to carry out Chairman Mao's latest directives without the slightest deviation, to further carry out the "three-in-one" struggle for power, to grasp and use power well, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

On February 24, the provisional highest authority in Shanghai—the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee—held a grand meeting. Workers, staff, students, soldiers, peasants, and residents from various factories, offices, schools, military units, and neighborhoods listened to and watched the live broadcast of the meeting via radio and television. When they heard Chairman Mao's latest directives, both banks of the Huangpu River were filled with joy. People felt immense happiness and excitement, repeatedly shouting enthusiastically: "Chairman Mao strongly supports the proletarian revolutionary masses!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Before this meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee convened an enlarged meeting. Based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's latest directives, they reviewed the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai since the January Revolution.

The enlarged meeting of the Revolutionary Committee believed: the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses in Shanghai was carried out from the bottom up during the January Revolution. The January Revolution is a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a great revolution led by the proletarian revolutionary masses under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

In December of last year, the proletarian revolutionary masses among workers, students, and cadres in Shanghai united and launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road. They faced a fierce counterattack from these people, who stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, directing their puppets, the heads of the "Red Guards," to incite a large number of deceived workers to plot the "three stops" incident of stopping electricity, water, and transportation, attempting to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For a short period, Shanghai's industry and transportation were paralyzed. At this time, the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai united, taking the fate of socialist economy and proletarian dictatorship into their own hands, going to the railways and docks, seizing and taking control of the great power of revolution and production.

It was in this struggle against counter-revolutionary economism and the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line that the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai truly understood a great truth taught repeatedly by Chairman Mao: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

In the great January Revolution, the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai actually seized the party power, political power, economic power, and cultural power held by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road from the bottom up. At every critical moment in this struggle for power and counter-struggle for power, our great leader Chairman Mao always gave the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of Shanghai the most affectionate care and the strongest support. Chairman Mao personally approved the publication of the "Statement to the People of the Whole City of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Notice," personally affirmed the rebirth of the "Wenhui Daily" and the "Liberation Daily," and the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai highly praised a series of revolutionary actions by the proletarian revolutionary masses in Shanghai. Chairman Mao's directive on the "three-in-one" joint struggle for power illuminated the road of the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses in Shanghai, guiding this struggle from one victory to another. On February 5, based on the initial victory of the struggle for power from the bottom up, representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, and revolutionary cadres who insisted on the proletarian revolutionary line implemented the "three-in-one" combination, seized all the power held by the handful of power-holders within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee who are taking the capitalist road, and established the provisional highest authority in Shanghai. This is a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat! This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

After the establishment of the provisional highest authority, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai entered a new high tide. The provisional highest authority, with the revolutionary leftists as the core of the "three-in-one" combination, provided strong support from the top down to the revolutionary rebels in various units and departments, creating more favorable conditions for the struggle for power from the bottom up. After the establishment of the provisional highest authority, the implementation of the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" was greatly promoted, and a great situation emerged. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres were more enthusiastic, more spirited, and more vigorous, completing their tasks actively with the clearest attitude and the most resolute actions. The leadership and advantages of the proletarian revolutionary masses became a powerful driving force for the development of production.

Based on the above analysis, the enlarged meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee unanimously adopted the draft resolution on "The Current Situation and Tasks of the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai" and decided to convene a city-wide meeting to spread Chairman Mao's voice widely among the broad revolutionary masses of the city and turn it into the practical actions of the masses. The leading members of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, including Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, attended the meeting on February 24.

At the meeting, Zhang Chunqiao reported to the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of Shanghai on the process of reporting work to Chairman Mao, conveyed the important directives of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and proposed the main tasks of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. At the beginning of his speech, he told everyone with great excitement that our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health! At this moment, the entire venue was filled with thunderous cheers, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" lasted for a long time.

Representatives of various revolutionary rebel factions in Shanghai and representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai from the army, navy, and air force spoke at the meeting. They said: Our great leader Chairman Mao has always given the closest care and greatest support to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. Recently, Chairman Mao has given the latest directives on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the proletarian revolutionary masses in Shanghai, are determined to turn it into our practical actions and use it as a guiding light in the struggle for power.

The meeting finally read out the draft resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee on "The Current Situation and Tasks of the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai" for discussion and trial implementation by various revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses throughout the city, and the entire venue applauded enthusiastically in support.

Chairman Mao's latest directives brought immense joy to the people of Shanghai. On February 24, the snowy streets of Shanghai were filled with red flags and drums, and the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of the entire city held a celebratory parade, determined to continue the spirit of the January Revolution, with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm, to continue to advance, and to definitely achieve greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the next few months, to report to Chairman Mao.

    最坚决地听毛主席的话进一步开展“三结合”夺权斗争掌好权用好权
    上海市革命委员会举行盛大集会
    张春桥同志以极其兴奋的心情告诉大家，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身体非常健康！这时全场欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    新华社上海二十七日电　当前，一月革命的风暴，正在席卷全国，无产阶级文化大革命出现了一片大好形势。在这个向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，从北京传来了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央对无产阶级文化大革命的许多极其重要的指示，上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众从中得到了极其巨大的鼓舞，汲取了无穷无尽的力量。他们庄严宣誓：最坚决地听我们伟大领袖毛主席的话，不折不扣地执行毛主席最新指示，进一步开展“三结合”夺权斗争，掌好权，用好权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    二月二十四日，上海的临时最高权力机构——上海市革命委员会隆重举行盛大集会。许多工厂、机关、学校、部队、农村以及里弄的革命群众，通过有线广播和电视，收听和收看了大会实况。当他们听到了毛主席的最新指示时，黄浦江两岸，一片欢腾。人们感到无限幸福、无比激动，一遍又一遍地热情欢呼：“毛主席最支持无产阶级革命派！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    在这个大会之前，上海市革命委员会召集了扩大会议，根据毛主席最新指示的精神，回顾了一月革命以来上海无产阶级文化大革命运动的发展。
    革命委员会扩大会议认为：上海市无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，是在一月革命的过程中自下而上地进行的。一月革命，是在无产阶级专政下的革命。它是在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展夺权斗争的一场轰轰烈烈的大革命。
  去年十二月，上海的工人、学生、干部中的无产阶级革命派联合起来，向着旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，遭到了他们的疯狂反扑。那一小撮人刮起了一股反革命经济主义的黑风，指使其御用工具“赤卫队”的头子，煽动大批受蒙蔽的工人，阴谋制造停电、停水、停交通的“三停”事件，妄图破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。在一个短时期内，使上海的工业、交通等陷入了瘫痪状态。这时，上海的革命造反派联合起来，把社会主义经济和无产阶级专政的命运掌握在自己手里，上铁路，去码头，把革命和生产的大权都夺了过来，掌了起来。
    就在这场反对反革命经济主义、粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争中，上海的革命造反派真正懂得了毛主席反复教导的一个伟大真理：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    在伟大的一月革命中，上海的革命造反派实际上已经自下而上地把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持的党权、政权、财权、文权夺到了手。在这场夺权和反夺权斗争的每一个关键时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席总是给予上海的无产阶级革命派和革命人民以最亲切的关怀和最有力的支持。毛主席亲自批准发表了《告上海全市人民书》、《紧急通告》，亲自肯定了《文汇报》《解放日报》的新生，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，高度赞扬了上海无产阶级革命派的一系列的革命行动，毛主席关于“三结合”联合夺权的指示，更照亮了上海无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的道路，引导了这场斗争从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。二月五日，在自下而上地夺权斗争已经取得初步胜利的基础上，上海各革命群众组织的代表，中国人民解放军驻沪部队的负责人和坚持无产阶级革命路线的革命领导干部，实行了“三结合”，夺取了旧上海市委和市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切权力，建立了上海市的临时最高权力机构。这是一场在无产阶级专政下的革命！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    临时最高权力机构建立以后，上海的无产阶级文化大革命出现了新的高潮。以革命左派为核心的“三结合”的临时最高权力机构，使各单位、各部门的革命造反派得到自上而下的强有力的支持，为自下而上的夺权创造了更为有利的条件。临时最高权力机构建立以后，大大地推动了“抓革命，促生产”方针的实现，出现了一片大好形势。广大工、农、兵、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，斗志更加昂扬，精神更加振奋，意气更加风发，以最明确的态度，最坚决的行动，主动地完成了任务。无产阶级革命派的领导和优势，成为推动生产发展的强大动力。
    根据上述分析，上海市革命委员会扩大会议一致通过了《当前上海文化大革命的形势和任务》的决议草案，并且决定了召开全市规模的大会，以便把毛主席的声音广泛地传播到全市广大革命群众中去，化为广大群众的实际行动。上海市革命委员会领导成员张春桥、姚文元以及其他领导成员出席了二十四日的大会。
    张春桥同志在大会上向上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众，报告了向毛主席汇报工作的经过，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的重要指示，提出了当前上海无产阶级文化大革命的各项主要任务。他在讲话开始时，以极其兴奋的心情告诉大家，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身体非常健康！这时全场欢声雷动，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声经久不息。
    上海各革命造反派代表和中国人民解放军驻沪陆、海、空三军代表，先后在会上发言。他们说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席，一直对上海的无产阶级文化大革命，给予最亲切的关怀和巨大的支持。最近，毛主席他老人家对无产阶级文化大革命作了最新指示，我们上海无产阶级革命派决心把它化为自己的实际行动，作为今后夺权斗争中的指路明灯。
    大会最后宣读了上海市革命委员会关于《当前上海文化大革命的形势和任务》的决议草案，供全市各革命组织和革命群众讨论和试行，全场热烈鼓掌表示拥护。
    毛主席的最新指示，给上海人民带来无比的欢腾。二十四日，白雪皑皑的上海街头，红旗招展，锣鼓齐鸣，全市无产阶级革命派和革命群众举行了庆祝游行，决心继续发扬一月革命的精神，以更大的革命热情，继续前进，在今后几个月内，一定要夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大的胜利，向毛主席他老人家作汇报。
