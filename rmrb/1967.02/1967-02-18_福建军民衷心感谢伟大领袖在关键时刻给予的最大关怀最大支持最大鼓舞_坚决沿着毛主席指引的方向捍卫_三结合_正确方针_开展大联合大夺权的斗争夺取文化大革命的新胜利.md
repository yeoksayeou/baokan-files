Fuzhou military and civilians heartily thank the great leader for his maximum care, support, and encouragement at the critical moment. They resolutely defend the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" as guided by Chairman Mao and launch a struggle for great unity and seizure of power to achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

The military personnel of the three services firmly grasp their rifles and declare: They will resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary new onslaught and are ready at any time to strike all enemies who dare to invade.

New China News Agency, Fuzhou, February 17th - After the "Fujian Province Swearing-in Meeting to Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" sent a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, and after other reports from the meeting and the editorial "Firmly Defend the Correct Policy of 'Three-in-One Combination'" published by the People's Daily were broadcast nationwide, the entire city of Fuzhou was in a festive mood. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres enthusiastically cheered: This is the greatest support and encouragement from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and it is also the new battle mobilization order issued by our great commander Chairman Mao to us. They solemnly swore: They will definitely follow the direction indicated by the great commander Chairman Mao, with high morale, to seize victory in the great unity and seizure of power by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

From last night to today, the entire city of Fuzhou was adorned with red flags, and the sounds of firecrackers, drums, battle songs, and slogans shook the earth. Teams of revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards from all directions, carrying giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and large red victory announcements, surged towards the reception station for revolutionary masses visiting the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fuzhou to report the good news. In front of the reception station, the sounds of firecrackers and slogans echoed through the night, and people enthusiastically shouted: "Salute to the great People's Liberation Army of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The loudspeakers of the stationed troops repeatedly transmitted the most resolute and powerful voice: "The People's Liberation Army firmly supports the seizure of power by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat! Resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary new onslaught!" At the same time, countless propaganda teams in the main streets of the city propagated the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" shining with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. All this fully shows that the true revolutionary forces of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's correct policy of "three-in-one combination," and the People's Liberation Army is a powerful pillar of the "three-in-one combination."

Last night, the "August 29th Revolutionary Rebel Command" of Fujian Province was brightly lit, and the young revolutionaries who were discussing the next battle deployment heard the broadcast and excitedly shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" They said: "This victory is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! We, the entire 'August 29th,' swear to Chairman Mao: We will study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, constantly summarize experience and lessons in the struggle, be humble and learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, unite all forces that can be united, implement the 'three-in-one combination,' launch the struggle for great unity and seizure of power, and with firm fighting will, seize new victories!" Amidst the joy, some rushed to write large red victory announcements, and others printed leaflets. They carried the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, set off firecrackers, and shouted revolutionary slogans to the reception station for revolutionary masses visiting the Fuzhou troops to report the good news to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and to the People's Liberation Army. The young revolutionaries said: The frontline troops of Fujian are not only the defenders of the country's coastal defense but also the strong backing of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. We feel proud to have a People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao himself to support our revolution.

The people of the old revolutionary base areas of Fujian, rich in revolutionary traditions, were overjoyed and spread the news when they heard the broadcast. They rushed to the reception station for revolutionary masses visiting the Fuzhou troops at night to report the good news and thanked Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for their greatest support and encouragement to the people of the old revolutionary base areas in their revolution. They excitedly said: Chairman Mao understands the feelings of the revolutionary people of the old base areas the best. We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production," carry forward the glorious tradition of holding a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other to make revolution, actively participate in the spring plowing and production, and achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

The revolutionary workers of the Fujian Provincial Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Command were overjoyed when they heard the broadcast. They exclaimed from the bottom of their hearts: "Chairman Mao's heart is forever connected with ours, the revolutionary workers." They said: Under the rule of counter-revolutionary white terror, it was Chairman Mao who supported us, enabling us to break through countless difficulties and emerge. We specially made trouble for the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. At the critical moment when the bourgeois reactionary line launched a new counterattack and attempted to disrupt the great unity and seizure of power by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, Chairman Mao once again firmly supported us and thoroughly smashed the new conspiracy of the class enemy. They resolutely declared that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by learning from the conqueror," and press on to seize new victories. Revolutionary leading cadres, member of the Secretariat of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Governor Wei Jinshui, after listening to the broadcast, excitedly said: This is the greatest support, encouragement, and care from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the responsible persons of various revolutionary mass organizations in Fujian Province, local military responsible persons, and revolutionary leading cadres to carry out the struggle for great unity and seizure of power through the "three-in-one combination." We must enthusiastically respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, put politics in command, go among the masses, and learn well from the young revolutionaries, the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary peasants. Together with the broad revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, we will launch the struggle for great unity and seizure of power.

Last night, the revolutionary comrades of the Party School of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also went to the reception station for revolutionary masses visiting the Fuzhou troops with the young revolutionaries of the "August 29th Revolutionary Rebel Command" of Fujian Province to report the good news. In the reporting team, there were also some masses who had once been misled and made mistakes. They raised their awareness and declared that they would resolutely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

New China News Agency, Fujian Front, February 17th - The military personnel of the army, navy, and air force on the Fujian front, while vigilantly guarding the coastal defense, joyfully celebrated the victory of the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Fujian Province in thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and the brilliant victory of the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" shining with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed with great excitement: They will most resolutely execute the instructions of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, strengthen war preparedness, defend the national defense, defend the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, defend the Cultural Revolution, and more firmly support and assist the true revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. They will more firmly defend and execute the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" for united seizure of power and seize new victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Today, the coastal defense front of Fujian is adorned with red flags, and the loudspeakers repeatedly broadcast the great news of Fujian military and civilians smashing the counter-revolutionary current under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the editorial "Firmly Defend the Correct Policy of 'Three-in-One Combination'" from the People's Daily. From the frontline trenches and sentry posts to the air force airfields, naval docks, and various military camps, everywhere is in a state of excitement, with cheers echoing. The soldiers waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted thousands of times: "Long live the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Many soldiers, after listening to the broadcast, faced the portrait of Chairman Mao and excitedly said: This is our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, who, at the critical moment of the great unity and seizure of power by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, gave us the greatest care, support, and encouragement. We will not disappoint the expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Li Kongque, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and the head nurse of the frontline hospital, was so excited last night after listening to the broadcast that she couldn't sleep. She said: "Not long ago, the frontline troops of Fujian held a conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. A handful of people with ulterior motives incited some uninformed masses to storm the venue, directing the spearhead of the struggle directly at the troops. We then launched a resolute struggle against them. In the sharp and complex struggle, I seemed to hear Chairman Mao's voice: 'Li Kongque, you are right!' Instantly, I felt an endless surge of strength. At the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Fujian are uniting and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, Chairman Mao's voice came again. Chairman Mao! You are forever heart-to-heart with us revolutionaries. To defend your revolutionary line and the correct policy of 'three-in-one combination,' I will resolutely fight to the end and contribute everything I have."

The soldiers of various frontline units held discussions after listening to the broadcast. They unanimously agreed that smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" shining with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically praised the "three-in-one combination" as being very good and having great power. The soldiers said that the characteristic of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line this time is to fiercely oppose the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" for united seizure of power. The enemy fiercely opposes it because the enemy is most afraid of the "three-in-one combination" policy. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We must firmly defend the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" and seize complete victory in great unity and seizure of power. Former volunteer army lone hero and deputy battalion commander of a certain unit, Shanhai Jin, said in the discussion that Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" policy is the magic weapon for great unity and seizure of power, seizing good power, and holding good power. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are most afraid of and hate the "three-in-one combination" policy. They play tricks and use deceit, attempting to disrupt the "three-in-one combination" and direct the spearhead of the struggle at the People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao, at the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and at revolutionary leading cadres. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the cause of the people, and they will never deviate from this logic." The facts completely prove that the new counterattack and new trouble-making of the class enemy will only end in complete failure in the face of the proletarian revolutionary cadres who realize the "three-in-one combination" according to Chairman Mao's teachings. We, the coastal defense soldiers, are determined to defend the "three-in-one combination" policy with our lives and blood.

The soldiers of the "Sea Tiger Boat," who have made outstanding achievements in defending the coastal frontier, solemnly promised to the great leader Chairman Mao with hearts full of excitement: At the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary cadres implement the "three-in-one combination" to seize power, they will defend the correct policy of "three-in-one combination" and the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the death.

On the coastal defense line, everywhere is filled with a revolutionary fighting atmosphere. The soldiers of the three frontline services, who are inspired by the new victories achieved by the proletarian revolutionary cadres, are full of fighting spirit, firmly grasp their rifles, and more vigilantly guard their battle positions, ready at any time to strike all enemies who dare to invade, and are determined to be faithful defenders of the Cultural Revolution. Deputy boat captain Wu Jiqi, who was awarded first-class merit in the sea battle east of Chongwu, said: We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasp revolution, promote war preparedness, work, and production," strengthen war preparedness, and be ready for battle. If the imperialists and their running dogs dare to come and disturb and sabotage, we will definitely break their backs and smash their dog heads. The soldiers of a certain observation post on the frontline of the coastal defense said: The proletarian revolutionary cadres implement the "three-in-one combination" and seize power from the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, hitting the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and hurting the hearts of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Our station is only separated by a body of water from the islands occupied by the Kuomintang bandits. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, monitor the enemy's actions, and better defend the coastal defense, so that the proletarian revolutionary cadres across the country can concentrate on making revolution and implementing the "three-in-one combination" for great unity and seizure of power. If the enemy dares to invade, we will smash them to pieces.

    从昨晚到今天，整个福州城红旗飘飘，鞭炮声、锣鼓声、战歌声、口号声震天动地，组成了欢庆粉碎资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑取得胜利的凯歌。革命工人、革命农民、革命干部和红卫兵小将们的队伍，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和大红喜报，从四面八方涌向中国人民解放军驻军部队革命群众来访接待站报喜。接待站前，鞭炮声和口号声通宵不绝，人们尽情高呼：“向伟大的中国人民解放军致敬！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”驻军部队的扩音器里一再传出最坚定的巨大声音：“中国人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派夺权！坚决镇压反革命的新反扑！”与此同时，数不清的宣传队在全市各主要街道宣传闪烁着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针。这一切充分表明福建省、福州市真正的无产阶级革命力量坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的
  “三结合”的正确方针，中国人民解放军是“三结合”的强大支柱。
    夜晚，福建省“八·二九”革命造反总司令部里灯火辉煌，正在讨论下一步战斗部署的革命小将们听到广播后，激动地齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”他们说：“这次胜利是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一次伟大胜利！我们‘八·二九’全体战士向毛主席宣誓：我们要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，在斗争中不断总结经验教训，戒骄戒躁，虚心向工农兵学习，团结一切可以团结的力量，实行
  ‘三结合’，开展大联合、大夺权的斗争，以坚定的战斗意志去夺取新的胜利！”他们在一片喜悦声中，有的赶写大红喜报，有的刻印传单。他们抬着毛主席巨幅画像，敲锣打鼓，鸣放鞭炮，高呼革命口号，到福州部队革命群众来访接待站向毛主席和党中央报喜，向人民解放军报喜。革命小将们说：福建前线三军既是祖国海防的保卫者，也是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。我们有一支由毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军支持我们闹革命，感到自豪。
    富有革命传统的福建老区人民，当他们收听到广播后，欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，连夜来到福州部队革命群众来访接待站报喜，感谢毛主席和党中央对老区人民闹革命的最大支持和鼓舞。他们激动地说：毛主席最了解我们老区革命人民的心情。我们一定牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，发扬当年一手拿枪、一手拿锄闹革命的光荣传统，积极投入春耕大生产，夺取革命、生产双丰收。
    福建省工人革命造反总司令部的革命工人一听到广播，乐得从心底迸发出一个共同的声音：“毛主席他老人家的心和我们革命工人的心是永远连在一起的。”他们说：在反革命白色恐怖的统治下，正是毛主席他老人家支持我们，使我们冲破重重困难杀了出来，大造特造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。在资产阶级反动路线实行新反扑，企图破坏无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的关键时刻，毛主席他老人家又坚决支持我们，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的新阴谋。他们坚决表示，一定要遵循毛主席的教导，“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”，乘胜追击，夺取新的胜利。革命的领导干部、中共福建省委书记处书记、省长魏金水听了广播后，激动地说：这是毛主席和党中央对福建省各革命群众组织负责人、当地驻军负责人和革命领导干部三结合进行大联合、大夺权斗争的最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大关怀。我们要热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，很好地向革命小将学习，向人民解放军学习，向革命的工人、革命的农民学习，和广大无产阶级革命派在一起，开展大联合、大夺权的斗争。
    昨夜，中共福建省委党校的革命同志，也同福建省“八·二九”革命造反总司令部的小将们一起，连夜乘车赶到福州部队革命群众来访接待站报喜。在报喜队伍中，也有曾经因受蒙蔽而犯了错误的群众。他们提高了觉悟，表示坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    新华社福建前线十七日电　福建前线陆海空三军指战员在百倍警惕守卫海防的同时，纵情欢呼福建省无产阶级革命派彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线又一次新反扑的胜利，欢呼闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的“三结合”正确方针的辉煌胜利。他们怀着无比激动的心情表示：最最坚决地执行最高统帅毛主席的指示，加强战备，保卫国防，保卫无产阶级专政下的大民主，保卫文化大革命，更加坚定不移地支持和援助真正的无产阶级革命派，更加坚定地保卫和执行“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    今天，福建海防前线到处风展红旗如画，广播喇叭一遍又一遍地广播着毛泽东思想指引福建军民粉碎反革命逆流的大喜讯和《人民日报》《坚决捍卫“三结合”的正确方针》的社论。从前沿阵地、哨所，到空军机场、海军码头和各部队营区，到处一片沸腾，欢声雷动。指战员们挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”许多指战员听完广播，面对毛主席画像激动地说：这是最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，在无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权的关键时刻，对我们的最大关怀、最大支持、最大鼓舞。我们决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的期望，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。学习毛主席著作积极分子、前线部队总医院护士长李孔雀，昨晚听了广播，激动得一夜不能入睡。她说：“不久前福建前线部队召开学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，一小撮别有用心的人煽动一些不明真相的群众冲击会场，把斗争矛头直接指向部队。我们当时对他们展开了坚决的斗争。在尖锐复杂的斗争中，我仿佛听到毛主席的声音：‘李孔雀，你做得对！’顿时浑身增添了无穷的力量。在福建无产阶级革命派大联合，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的关键时刻，又传来了毛主席的声音。毛主席呀毛主席！您永远和我们革命战士心连心。为了捍卫您老人家的革命路线，捍卫‘三结合’正确方针，我要坚决斗争到底，贡献自己的一切。”
    前线各部队指战员听完广播纷纷举行座谈，他们一致认为：粉碎资产阶级反动路线的又一次新反扑，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利，是闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的“三结合”方针的伟大胜利。他们热烈赞扬“三结合”好得很，威力大得很。指战员们说，资产阶级反动路线这次新反扑的特点，是拚命反对“三结合”联合夺权的正确方针。敌人拚命反对，是因为敌人最害怕“三结合”方针。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们一定要坚决捍卫“三结合”的正确方针，夺取大联合、大夺权的完全胜利。前志愿军孤胆英雄、某部副营长蕳海金在座谈中说，毛主席的“三结合”方针，是大联合、大夺权，夺好权、掌好权的法宝。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派最害怕、最仇视“三结合”方针，他们耍阴谋、使诡计，妄图破坏“三结合”，把斗争矛头直接指向毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军，指向无产阶级革命派，指向革命的领导干部。毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”事实完全证明，阶级敌人的这次新的反扑，新的捣乱，在按照毛主席的教导实现“三结合”的无产阶级革命派面前，它们的结局只会是彻底完蛋。我们海防战士决心用生命和热血来捍卫“三结合”方针。
    在保卫海疆的战斗中战功卓著的“海上猛虎艇”指战员，以万分激动的心情向伟大领袖毛主席保证：在无产阶级革命派实行“三结合”夺权斗争的关键时刻，誓死保卫“三结合”的正确方针，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    海防线上，到处充满了革命的战斗气氛，被无产阶级革命派取得的新胜利所振奋了的前线三军指战员，个个斗志昂扬，紧握枪杆，更加百倍警惕地守卫在战斗岗位上，随时准备狠狠打击胆敢来犯的一切敌人，誓做文化大革命的忠实保卫者。在崇武以东海战中荣立一等功的副艇长吴加溪说，我们一定遵照毛主席关于抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产的教导，加强战备，严阵以待，美帝国主义及其帮凶胆敢前来骚扰破坏，我们坚决打断它的脊骨，砸烂它的狗头。海防前沿某部观察站的战士们说：无产阶级革命派实行“三结合”，从党内走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权，打在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上，痛在帝、修、反的心上。我们的驻地和蒋匪帮盘踞的岛屿只有一水之隔，我们一定要百倍提高警惕，监视敌人的行动，更好地保卫海防，让全国无产阶级革命派放心干革命，实行“三结合”大联合大夺权。敌人胆敢来犯，我们就砸它个稀巴烂。
