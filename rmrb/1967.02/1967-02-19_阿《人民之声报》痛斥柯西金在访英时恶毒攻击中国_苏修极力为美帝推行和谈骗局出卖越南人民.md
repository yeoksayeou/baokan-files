The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* today published an editorial strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leader and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Alexei Kosygin, for his vicious attacks on China during his visit to Britain. The editorial also denounces the Soviet revisionists' efforts to push the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception and betray the Vietnamese people.

The editorial states that Kosygin, during his visit to London, became a salesman for the Soviet revisionist clique's anti-China policy. With deep hatred for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the great Chinese people who are advancing courageously on the revolutionary road under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, Kosygin made reckless remarks and launched a frenzied attack on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Chinese people. In his television interview, he openly supported the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China and expressed "sympathy" for their anti-party, anti-people, and anti-socialist crimes.

The editorial points out that the main issue discussed between Kosygin and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson was the Vietnam problem. To force the Vietnamese people to surrender to the U.S. aggressors and accept the U.S. "peace talks" deception, it was after Kosygin's speech on the Vietnam problem in London that U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson came out to help him, hastily announcing the suspension of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while suggesting that "Hanoi make a corresponding expression of goodwill." This is not coincidental but is based on a secret cooperation plan.

The editorial says that the Soviet revisionist leadership is now openly colluding with the imperialists, trying to force the Vietnamese people to accept Johnson's "bombing to force peace" talks. However, the heroic Vietnamese people will neither yield to the pressure of the Khrushchev revisionists nor surrender to the violence and deception of the U.S. imperialist bandits. The heroic Vietnamese people will continue their glorious struggle for liberation until they achieve complete victory. The editorial also denounces the collusion between imperialism and revisionism in Europe, implementing a policy of appeasement, shifting their strategic focus to Asia, and directing their main targets at the People's Republic of China.

The editorial concludes by saying that the result of Kosygin's visit to Britain once again clearly shows that the successors of Khrushchev are sinking deeper into the path of betrayal and capitulation. They are further strengthening their comprehensive cooperation with U.S. imperialism and other imperialists. The agreements and conspiracies reached and plotted by imperialism and revisionism in London are another shameful betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership of the socialist revolution, the Soviet people and the peoples of various European countries, all revolutionary peoples fighting for national freedom and independence, and all anti-imperialist forces in the world.

    阿《人民之声报》痛斥柯西金在访英时恶毒攻击中国
    苏修极力为美帝推行和谈骗局出卖越南人民
    新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》今天发表编辑部文章，严厉谴责苏修头目、苏联部长会议主席柯西金访问英国期间，恶毒攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，进一步勾结美、英帝国主义，积极为美国政府在越南问题上推行“和谈”骗局效劳。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者柯西金在伦敦成了苏修统治集团反华政策的推销员。他怀着对中国无产阶级文化大革命，对高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想红旗，正在革命道路上奋勇前进的伟大中国人民的刻骨仇恨，大放厥词，疯狂攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的中国人民。他在电视谈话中公然支持中国的反革命修正主义分子，对他们的反党、反人民和反社会主义的罪恶勾当表示“同情”。
    文章指出，柯西金和英国首相威尔逊会谈的主要问题是越南问题。为了迫使越南人民向美国侵略者投降，接受美国的“和谈”骗局，正是柯西金在伦敦发表了关于越南问题的谈话以后，美国总统约翰逊出来帮他的忙，急忙宣布暂停轰炸越南民主共和国，同时建议“河内作出相应的善良愿望的表示”。这绝不是偶然的，而是建立在秘密的合作计划的基础上的。
    文章说，苏修领导集团现在公开和帝国主义者同流合污，竭力强迫越南人民接受约翰逊的“以炸迫和”的“和谈”。但是，英雄的越南人民既不会在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的压力面前屈服，也不会在美帝国主义强盗的暴力和欺骗诱饵面前投降。英雄的越南人民将把自己的光荣解放斗争进行到取得完全的胜利。文章还谴责帝国主义和修正主义相互勾结，在欧洲执行“绥靖政策”，把战略中心移向亚洲，把它们的主要矛头指向中华人民共和国。
    文章最后说，柯西金访英的结果再次清楚地表明，赫鲁晓夫的继承人在背叛和投降的道路上陷得更深，他们正在同美帝国主义及其它帝国主义者进一步加强全面的合作。帝国主义和修正主义在伦敦达成的协议和策划的阴谋，是苏修领导集团对社会主义革命，对苏联人民和欧洲各国人民，对所有为争取民族自由和独立而斗争的各国革命人民，对全世界反帝力量的又一可耻背叛。
