Comrade Enver Hoxha Calls for Schools to Cultivate New Communist People
The Young Generation Should Become Steadfast Revolutionary Fighters
Youth Participating in Land Reclamation Receive a Statue of Ouyang Hai from Comrade Enver Hoxha

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana, on January 28, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, in a congratulatory letter to the teachers and students of the November 7th Comprehensive Technical School in Tirana on the occasion of the school's 20th anniversary of reconstruction, pointed out that the party and the people require the school to first cultivate people who are politically, ideologically, and physically tempered, and who have a communist worldview; to foster more steadfast fighters who can struggle against various manifestations of bourgeoisie and revisionism.

Comrade Hoxha, representing the Central Committee of the Party and in his personal name, sent this congratulatory letter, saying, "Our revolution is advancing irresistibly. Our country is changing rapidly. In every aspect of life, we have achieved great and extensive development. Production is increasing, the people's living standards are improving, and the thoughts of our people are becoming revolutionary. The reason we have achieved all this is our socialist system and the high level of socialist consciousness and enthusiasm of the people under the leadership of the Party of Labour."

Comrade Hoxha said, "Today, the task assigned by the Party to the schools is to make teaching closely linked with life, theory closely linked with practice, and strive to build socialism."

He pointed out, "The Party and the people require the schools not only to cultivate people with scientific knowledge and professional skills, but first and foremost to cultivate people who are politically, ideologically, and physically tempered, and who have a communist worldview. They should be ready at any time to participate in labor, make sacrifices, fully understand the meaning of serving the people, strive wholeheartedly for the great cause of socialism, and be ready to go to the borders of the motherland when life demands it."

Comrade Hoxha said, "The schools and youth organizations should continue to educate our youth with the glorious fighting traditions of our predecessors, with the revolutionary class spirit and noble morality, with the spirit of bravery and loyalty to the motherland and the revolutionary cause. Our schools and youth organizations should every day use the thoughts of Marxism-Leninism, the correct line of our Party, and the rich revolutionary experience of the Party to educate, temper, and foster the young generation, so that every young person thinks, works, and lives like a true revolutionary. The youth organizations and schools should guide the youth to actively engage in productive labor and various political activities, foster more steadfast fighters who can struggle against various manifestations of bourgeois and revisionist views and ideological consciousness, temper the youth physically and militarily, so that the youth always maintain revolutionary vigilance and are ready at any time to defend and consolidate the fruits of the socialist revolution and oppose any enemy."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana, on January 27, the youth participating in land reclamation in the Fieri district held a meeting to accept the gift recently presented by Comrade Enver Hoxha—a relief statue of Ouyang Hai.

Duka, First Secretary of the Fieri District Committee of the Albanian Labour Youth League, said in his speech, "Comrade Enver Hoxha's gift to the youth of our district is a great encouragement, filling us with new strength and revolutionary enthusiasm."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana, it was reported by local newspapers on January 28 that on January 27, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, wrote a letter to the Young Pioneers of Berat City, highly praising their revolutionary initiative and action of using their spare time to build cobblestone roads in the city.

Comrade Hoxha praised the children for learning to be bricklayers and stonemasons from a young age. He said, "Children building roads with stones will develop a great love for stones and will achieve great and glorious deeds with stones."

    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志一月二十八日在给地拉那十一月七日综合技术学校师生庆祝学校重建二十周年大会的贺信中指出，党和人民要求学校首先要培养出政治、思想和体力方面得到锻炼的、具有共产主义世界观的人；要造就更多的能够同资产阶级、修正主义的各种表现作斗争的坚强战士。
    霍查同志代表党中央和以他本人的名义发出的这封贺信说，我们的革命正在势不可挡地前进着。我们的国家正在迅速地变化着。在生活的每个方面，我们都取得了巨大和广泛的发展。生产在增长，人民生活在不断改善，我国人民的思想正在革命化，我们取得这一切成绩的原因是我国的社会主义制度和在劳动党领导下的人民群众的高度社会主义觉悟和干劲。
    霍查同志说，今天，党赋予学校的任务是使教学密切联系生活，理论密切联系实际，努力建设社会主义。
    他指出，党和人民要求学校不仅要培养出有科学知识和专业特长的人，而且首先要求学校培养出在政治、思想和体力方面得到锻炼的、具有共产主义世界观的人。他们应该是时刻准备着参加劳动，作出牺牲，充分理解为人民服务的意义，能全力为社会主义的伟大事业奋斗，一旦生活需要就能奔赴祖国边疆的人。
    霍查同志说，学校和青年组织应该继续用我们前辈光荣的战斗传统、用革命的阶级精神和高尚的道德、用勇敢和忠于祖国和革命事业的精神来教育我国青年。我们的学校和青年组织应该每天都用马克思列宁主义的思想、我党的正确路线和党的丰富的革命经验去教育、锻炼和造就青年一代，使每个青年象一个真正革命者那样思考、工作和生活。青年组织和学校应该引导青年更加积极地投入到生产劳动和轰轰烈烈的各项政治活动中去，造就更多的能够同资产阶级、修正主义观点和思想意识的各种表现作斗争的坚强战士，从体力上和军事上锻炼青年，使青年永远保持革命警惕，时刻准备着去保卫和巩固社会主义革命的胜利果实和反对任何敌人。
