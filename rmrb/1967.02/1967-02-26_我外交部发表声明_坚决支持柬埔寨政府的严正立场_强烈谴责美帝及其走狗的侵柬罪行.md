The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues a Statement:
Firmly Supporting the Cambodian Government's Just Stand, Strongly Condemning the US Imperialists' and Their Running Dogs' Invasion of Cambodia

The statement points out that the US imperialists and their accomplices' armed provocations and invasions of Cambodia can only arouse the Cambodian people's more resolute resistance. The US has done nothing but evil in Indochina and will absolutely not escape the punishment it deserves.

New China News Agency, February 25th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the 25th, strongly condemning the recent continuous crimes of the US imperialists and their running dogs invading the Kingdom of Cambodia, and expressing firm support for the Cambodian government's just stand.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

Since the beginning of this year, the US imperialists and their puppets in South Vietnam and Thailand have continuously carried out armed provocations and invasions of the Kingdom of Cambodia, violating Cambodia's sovereignty and threatening Cambodia's security. The Cambodian government has issued multiple statements and notes, expressing strong protests. The US imperialists and their South Vietnamese puppets not only do not listen to the Cambodian people's just voices but also escalate their actions. From February 18th to 21st, they continuously invaded Cambodia from the air, land, and sea, attacking Cambodia's national defense forces and militias. The Chinese people are greatly indignant about this. We strongly condemn the US imperialists' and their running dogs' aggressive behavior and firmly support the Cambodian government's just stand.

Cambodia is a neighbor of Vietnam. It has always upheld justice and maintained a policy of peace and neutrality, resisting various pressures from the US imperialists. The US imperialists have always seen Cambodia as an obstacle to their expansion of the war in Vietnam and as a thorn in their side. Now, the US imperialists are engaged in war blackmail in Vietnam, intensifying their deployment of aggression; at the same time, they are adopting more blatant high-pressure and intimidation tactics against the Kingdom of Cambodia. All of this fully shows that the US imperialists will not give up their arrogant plans to invade and enslave the peoples of the Indochina countries. What "peace talks" and "respect" for other countries' sovereignty and neutrality are all lies.

Chairman Mao Zedong said: "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their doom." The US imperialists' and their running dogs' aggressive and provocative activities against the Kingdom of Cambodia have repeatedly proven Chairman Mao Zedong's wise judgment.

We warn the US imperialists and their accomplices: the Cambodian people love peace but are not afraid of violence. Your aggression and provocation against the Kingdom of Cambodia can only arouse the Cambodian people's more resolute resistance. You have done nothing but evil in Indochina and will absolutely not escape the punishment you deserve. The 700 million Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Cambodian people and on the side of the peoples of the Indochina countries, fighting to the end to thoroughly frustrate the US imperialists' plans for aggression and war.

    我外交部发表声明
    坚决支持柬埔寨政府的严正立场  强烈谴责美帝及其走狗的侵柬罪行
    指出美帝及其同伙对柬埔寨的武装挑衅和入侵，只能激起柬埔寨人民更坚决的反抗。美帝在印度支那作尽了坏事，绝对逃脱不了应得的惩罚。
    新华社二十五日讯中华人民共和国外交部二十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗最近连续侵犯柬埔寨王国的罪行，并表示坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的严正立场。
    声明全文如下：
    今年以来，美帝国主义及其南越、泰国仆从，连续不断地对柬埔寨王国进行武装挑衅和入侵，破坏柬埔寨的主权，威胁柬埔寨的安全。柬埔寨王国政府多次发表公报，提出照会，表示强烈抗议。美帝国主义及其南越傀儡对柬埔寨人民这些正义的声音，非但根本不听，反而变本加厉，在二月十八日至二十一日，连续从空中、陆上和海面，侵犯柬埔寨王国，攻击柬埔寨的国防军和民兵。中国人民对此感到极大的愤慨。我们强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略行为，坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的严正立场。
    柬埔寨是越南的近邻。它一向主持正义，坚持和平中立政策，抵制了美帝国主义的各种压力。美帝国主义一直把柬埔寨看作为它扩大侵略越南战争的阻力，看作为它的眼中钉。现在，美帝国主义在越南正在进行战争讹诈，加紧扩大侵略的部署；与此同时，对柬埔寨王国采取更加露骨的高压和恫吓手段。这一切充分表明，美帝国主义决不会放弃侵略和奴役印度支那各国人民的狂妄计划。什么“和平谈判”，什么“尊重”别国的主权和中立，统统是骗人的鬼话。
    毛泽东主席说：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”美帝国主义及其走狗对柬埔寨王国的侵略和挑衅活动，一再证明了毛泽东主席这个英明的论断。
    我们警告美帝国主义及其同伙，柬埔寨人民是爱好和平的，也是不畏强暴的。你们对柬埔寨王国的侵略和挑衅，只能激起柬埔寨人民更坚决的反抗。你们在印度支那作尽了坏事，绝对逃脱不了应得的惩罚。七亿中国人民坚决站在柬埔寨人民一边，站在印度支那各国人民一边，为彻底挫败美帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划而斗争到底。
