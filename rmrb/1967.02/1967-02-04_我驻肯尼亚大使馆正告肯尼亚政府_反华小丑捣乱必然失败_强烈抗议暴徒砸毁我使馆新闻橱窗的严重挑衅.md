	Chinese Embassy in Kenya Warns Kenyan Government:
	Anti-China Clowns Will Surely Fail
	Strong Protest Against Vandals Destroying Embassy News Display

	NAIROBI, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Kenya issued a note to the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 2, strongly protesting the vandalism of the embassy's news display and demanding that the Kenyan government take action.

	The note stated: On the night of January 27, 1967, the news display windows of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Kenya were smashed by vandals. One of the windows displayed "People of the World Are Learning from Mao Zedong Thought," and the other displayed "Red Guards -- Vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This incident is a grave insult to the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao Zedong, to the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards, and to the great people of China. It is a serious provocation against the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China and the security of the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese government and people cannot tolerate this, and the Chinese Embassy expresses its strong indignation and protests to the Kenyan government.

	The note further stated: Chairman Mao Zedong taught us, "Make trouble, fail; make more trouble, fail again; till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries, and they are bound to follow it." Over the past two years, the reactionary forces in Kenya, instigated by imperialism, have repeatedly and recklessly engaged in anti-China activities, each time ending in failure. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is entering a new stage of comprehensive seizure of power, with a great situation. The revolutionary people of the world are rejoicing and applauding. All reactionary forces are terrified and panicked. At this time, the reactionary forces in Kenya, instigated by imperialism and modern revisionism, have once again come out to engage in new anti-China activities. It can be predicted that, like in the past, they will not gain any advantage this time. The great people of China, numbering 700 million, will not be harmed in the slightest by anyone's anti-China activities. The unprecedented influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will awaken all oppressed nations and peoples of the world. The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought will shine across the globe. We must warn the Kenyan government: The friendship between the peoples of China and Kenya is unbreakable. Those who act as imperialists' and modern revisionists' anti-China lackeys will surely meet a bad end! Whoever willingly becomes an anti-China pawn for imperialism and modern revisionism will surely reap what they sow and lift the stone only to drop it on their own feet!

	In conclusion, the Chinese Embassy's note sternly demands that the Kenyan government must severely punish the perpetrators, compensate for the damages, and take effective measures to stop anti-China activities. Otherwise, the Kenyan government will bear all the serious consequences that may arise.

    我驻肯尼亚大使馆正告肯尼亚政府
    反华小丑捣乱必然失败
    强烈抗议暴徒砸毁我使馆新闻橱窗的严重挑衅
    新华社三日讯　内罗毕消息：中国驻肯尼亚大使馆二日照会肯尼亚外交部，就暴徒砸毁中国大使馆新闻橱窗的严重挑衅，向肯尼亚政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：一九六七年一月二十七日夜，中华人民共和国驻肯尼亚大使馆新闻橱窗被暴徒砸毁。这两个橱窗，一个陈列的是“世界人民都在学习毛泽东思想”，另一个是“红卫兵——无产阶级文化大革命的闯将”。这一事件是对中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席、对中国无产阶级文化大革命的先锋红卫兵的极大污辱，是对伟大的七亿中国人民的严重挑衅，是对中华人民共和国主权和中国大使馆安全的侵犯。中国政府和中国人民对此是绝对不能容忍的，中国大使馆感到极大的愤慨并向肯尼亚政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：毛泽东主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”近两年来，肯尼亚的反动势力在帝国主义的唆使下，多次猖狂反华，每次都以失败而告终。当前，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在进入全面夺权的新阶段，形势大好。全世界革命人民为之欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快。一切反动势力为之丧魂失魄，怕得要死。在这个时候，肯尼亚的反动势力在帝国主义和现代修正主义的唆使下，又跳出来，进行反华的新勾当。可以断言，同过去一样，这次他们也决不会捞到什么便宜。伟大的七亿中国人民决不会因为任何人的反华勾当而损伤一根毫毛。史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，必将唤醒全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民。伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉必将普照全球。我们要正告肯尼亚政府：中肯两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的，凡是反华的人都没有好下场！谁甘心充当帝国主义、现代修正主义反华的马前卒，谁就必将自食恶果，搬起石头砸自己的脚！
    中国大使馆的照会最后严正要求肯尼亚政府必须严惩肇事者，赔偿损失，并且采取有效措施，制止反华活动。否则，由此产生的一切严重后果，均将由肯尼亚政府承担。
