The Soviet Revisionist Clique Will Surely Face the Just Judgment of the People of the World
The Chinese Association of Political and Legal Sciences Strongly Condemns the New Fascist Atrocities of the Soviet Revisionists

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on February 7, the Chinese Association of Political and Legal Sciences issued a statement today saying that on February 3, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique instigated thugs to storm the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, creating a shocking new bloodshed incident. They beat more than 30 of our diplomatic personnel and used various despicable methods to obstruct the normal activities of our embassy. This is a barbaric act rarely seen in the history of international diplomacy, a blatant violation of the most basic principles of international relations, a flagrant infringement on our country's sovereignty, and the most serious crime of undermining Sino-Soviet relations. It is also irrefutable evidence of their intention to further sell out to U.S. imperialism and deliberately create new anti-China incidents.

The statement warns the Soviet revisionist leadership clique: The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. The blood debt you owe the Chinese people must be repaid. The heinous crimes you have committed against the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the revolutionary people of the world will surely be judged and severely punished by the people of the world.

    苏修集团必将受到全世界人民正义审判
    我政法学会强烈谴责苏修新的法西斯暴行
    据新华社七日讯　中国政治法律学会今天发表声明说，苏联修正主义统治集团二月三日指使暴徒闯进中国驻苏大使馆制造骇人听闻的新的流血事件，殴打我外交人员等三十多人，并采用种种卑鄙手段阻碍我使馆的正常活动，这是世界外交史上罕见的、破坏最起码的国际关系准则的野蛮暴行，是对我国神圣主权的公然侵犯，是破坏中苏两国关系的最严重的罪行，也是他们进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义蓄意制造新的反华事件的铁证。中国法律工作者和中国人民最坚决支持我国政府二月五日的声明，并怀着无比愤怒的心情最强烈地谴责和声讨苏修所犯下的新的法西斯暴行。
    声明警告苏联修正主义领导集团说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不是好惹的，你们对中国人民欠下的血债一定要偿还。你们对中国人民、苏联人民和世界革命人民犯下的反共、反华、反人民的滔天罪行，定将受到全世界人民的正义审判和严厉惩罚。
