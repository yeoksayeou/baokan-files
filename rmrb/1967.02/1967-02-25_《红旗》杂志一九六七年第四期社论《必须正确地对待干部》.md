We must adhere to Mao Zedong Thought and to the cadre policy that Chairman Mao has consistently advocated, to correctly treat cadres. Only in this way can we establish the leadership core for the struggle to seize power, achieve the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and set up a genuine "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ with leadership capacity. Only in this way can we establish or strengthen the leadership teams for directing the cultural revolution and for directing production and business work, grasp all work, and truly seize power.

    我们必须按照毛泽东思想，按照毛主席一贯提倡的党的干部政策，来正确地对待干部，才能建立夺权斗争的领导核心，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，成立一个真正有领导能力的“三结合”的临时权力机构，才能建立或健全领导文化革命和领导生产、业务工作的班子，把各项工作抓起来，把权真正掌起来。
