The third batch of 1,071 Indonesian victims of persecution (including one newborn baby on the ship), who returned to the motherland aboard the Guanghua, arrived at the port of Zhanjiang this morning. Revolutionary masses of Zhanjiang and representatives of revolutionary rebels from the capital and other places who came to welcome the refugees gathered at the dock, warmly welcoming these patriotic overseas Chinese, who bravely and unyieldingly struggled under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dared to fight against the Indonesian reactionaries, and returned to the motherland's embrace in victory.

Zhanjiang, which is in the midst of the great struggle for the great alliance and seizure of power by the revolutionary masses, was today adorned with flying red flags and resounding victory songs. Revolutionary rebels, including workers, peasants, cadres, students, and other comrades from all over the country, gathered early in the morning at the dock, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, with hearts full of excitement. As the Guanghua slowly approached the dock, the revolutionary rebel masses on shore and the patriotic overseas Chinese on the ship raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically shouting: "Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" People also recited in unison the teachings of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they have no power at all. From a long-term point of view, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." At this moment, people on the ship and on shore shouted in unison: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

When the refugees disembarked, the dock loudspeaker broadcasted the welcoming speech from the Zhanjiang Revolutionary Rebel Committee for Receiving Refugees. The speech said: In the struggle against the anti-China and anti-Chinese policies of the Indonesian reactionaries, and in the extremely sharp and complex international class struggle, you fearlessly resisted violence, fought bravely and unyieldingly, united closely, maintained a righteous spirit, defended the dignity of our great motherland, and upheld the spirit of our heroic nation. You have shown the revolutionary spirit of the great Chinese people.

The speech said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are worn out and give up—the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." At present, the Indonesian reactionaries, in order to curry favor with their American imperialist masters, are colluding with the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique and are blowing even stronger anti-China and anti-Chinese winds. We solemnly warn the Indonesian reactionaries: Your evil deeds will not end well! The Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with!

Next, the dock broadcasted the written speech of the representative of the returning refugees to the welcoming relatives of the motherland. He, on behalf of the 1,071 refugees returning this time, expressed the highest respect to the relatives of the motherland! And conveyed the sincere wishes of the broad masses of refugees to our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao: Wish him eternal life! This refugee representative said, we sincerely thank Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the seven hundred million people of the motherland for their support and care, rescuing us from the white terror in Indonesia and returning us to the embrace of the brilliant and radiant socialist motherland, returning us to the world revolutionary base where the great proletarian cultural revolution is vigorously underway. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! We are liberated! We are free! We want to shout loudly: Our hearts' reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

This refugee representative expressed that after returning to the motherland, we will definitely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, and launch a comprehensive struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

At the front of the welcoming crowd at the dock, representatives of various revolutionary rebel groups in Zhanjiang, representatives of Red Guards from all over the country, representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the area, and worker representatives warmly shook hands with the refugees who were gradually coming ashore.

Upon seeing the relatives of the motherland, the persecuted overseas Chinese angrily denounced the fascist atrocities committed by the Indonesian reactionaries against the overseas Chinese. Among this batch of returning refugees, many people's bodies were severely damaged, and the number of injured and sick people increased several times compared to the previous two batches. A 60-year-old man from Sijili, Huang Duoxiang, was beaten and kicked more than 200 times by right-wing thugs in Indonesia last August, bleeding all over, with severe head and body injuries, and protruding eyeballs, and is still vomiting blood to this day.

Today, the revolutionary rebel organizations of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent congratulatory letters and telegrams, expressing warm congratulations and sincere greetings to the refugees returning to the motherland and to all the crew members of the Guanghua for completing the glorious task of transporting the third batch of refugees.

    向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗英勇不屈顽强斗争的爱国侨胞致敬！
    革命造反派热烈欢迎印尼难侨回到祖国怀抱
    难侨代表表示坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同革命造反派并肩战斗，誓把文化大革命进行到底
    据新华社湛江五日电  第三批乘光华轮回国的一千零七十一名印度尼西亚受害华侨（包括船上新生一名婴儿在内），今天上午回到湛江港。湛江市革命群众以及首都等地专程前来迎接难侨的革命造反派代表齐集港口码头，热烈欢迎这批高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、不怕牺牲、敢于造印尼反动派的反的爱国侨胞胜利回到祖国怀抱。
    正处在无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的伟大斗争中的湛江市，今天到处红旗飘扬，凯歌阵阵，广大革命造反派的工人、农民、干部、学生和其他来自全国各地的战友们，一清早就高举毛主席像，怀着激动的心情来到港口码头。当光华轮缓缓靠近码头时，岸上的革命造反派群众和船上的爱国侨胞高举起《毛主席语录》，热烈欢呼：“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“打倒印尼反动派！”人们还齐声朗读我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”这时，船上和岸上的人们齐声高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    当难侨们扶老携幼徐徐离船上岸的时候，码头广播器里传出了湛江接侨革命造反委员会的欢迎词。欢迎词说：你们在反对印尼反动派的反华排华斗争中，在异常尖锐复杂的国际阶级斗争中，不畏强暴，英勇不屈，紧密团结，正气凛然，维护了我们伟大祖国的尊严，坚持了我们英雄民族的气节，表现了伟大的中华儿女的革命硬骨头精神。
    欢迎词说，毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”目前，印尼反动派为了向他们的主子美帝国主义卖乖讨赏，联合叛徒苏修集团，还在变本加厉地吹起更大的反华排华妖风。我们严正警告印尼反动派：你们的一切罪恶行径是绝不会有好下场的！用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不是好惹的！
    接着，码头上广播了回国难侨代表向前来欢迎的祖国亲人发表的书面讲话。他代表这次回国的一千零七十一名难侨，向祖国亲人致以最崇高的敬意！并转达广大难侨对我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的最诚挚的心愿：祝颂他老人家万寿无疆！这位难侨代表说，我们最衷心地感谢毛主席，感谢党中央，感谢祖国七亿亲人对我们的支持和关怀，把我们从白色恐怖笼罩下的印度尼西亚拯救出来，胜利回到了光辉灿烂的社会主义祖国的怀抱，回到了正在轰轰烈烈地进行无产阶级文化大革命的世界革命的根据地。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们解放了！我们自由了！我们要尽情地高呼：我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    这位难侨代表表示，我们难侨们回到祖国以后，一定坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一边，站在革命造反派的一边，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开全面夺权斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在码头欢迎队伍的前头，湛江市各革命造反派的代表，全国各地红卫兵代表，中国人民解放军驻军代表，工人代表，同陆续走上岸来的难侨们热烈握手。
    受害侨胞一见到祖国亲人，就愤怒地控诉印尼反动派疯狂迫害华侨的法西斯暴行。这批回国的难侨中，许多人身体受到严重摧残，伤病员比前两批成倍增加。世居司吉利的六十多岁的老人黄度相，去年八月被印尼右派暴徒棍打脚踢了两百多下，遍体流血，头部和身部受重伤，眼球突出，直到现在还吐血。
    今天，华侨事务委员会的革命造反派组织分别发来贺信、贺电，向回到祖国的难侨们和完成接运第三批难侨这一光荣任务的光华轮全体船员，表示热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问。
