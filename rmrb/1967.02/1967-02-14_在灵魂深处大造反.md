In our struggle against class enemies, we fear neither hardship nor death. In transforming our thoughts, we must fear neither ugliness nor pain, and we must not protect our own shortcomings. Apart from the Party's cause, the people's interests, and the revolutionary situation, we have no concern for personal fame, profit, power, or position, nor for factionalism or seeking personal glory. All such trash must be swept away!

"The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to change the world includes the tasks of changing both the objective world and our subjective world..." This is the highest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao. We will resolutely carry it out and execute it!

We are revolutionaries who revolt against the objective world, and we are also revolutionaries who revolt against our subjective world. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and while transforming the objective world, we also intensify the transformation of our subjective world, becoming thoroughgoing revolutionary rebels.

A person's subjective world (that is, their thoughts) is a reflection of the objective world. Chairman Mao said: "Among these, class struggle in various forms has a profound impact on the development of human cognition. In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are imprinted with the mark of class." For example: In dealing with the masses, do we regard the masses as heroes, or do we regard ourselves as "heroes"? In dealing with victory, do we attribute it to the Party and Chairman Mao, or do we credit it to individuals or small groups? In dealing with the revolutionary rebel forces, do we see them all as Chairman Mao's soldiers, or do we see them only as "my" personal followers? In dealing with brother revolutionary organizations, do we treat them as equals and learn from them humbly, or do we take the good for ourselves and blame the bad on others, claiming "I am the greatest"? In dealing with seizing power, is it for the proletariat to seize power, for communism to seize power, or is it for individuals or small groups to seize power? In short, when faced with any issue, do we consider others or only ourselves? These specific questions reflect two kinds of thoughts: one is the new thought of the proletariat, and the other is the old thought of the bourgeoisie. The new thought is new in its "public" nature; the old thought is old in its "private" nature. These two thoughts are sworn enemies and cannot coexist. If you do not attack it, it will attack you; if you do not fight it, it will fight you; if you do not revolt against it, it will revolt against you. In our minds, it is either the proletarian thought that prevails or the bourgeois thought that prevails. Compromise and reform are not possible; peaceful coexistence and joint ventures are not feasible. We must wage a revolutionary struggle in our thoughts.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, transform people's souls, achieve the thought revolutionization of people, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system." We proletarian revolutionary rebels must make up our minds to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must wage a thorough revolution in the depths of our souls. We must revolt thoroughly, sweep away all backward, decayed, and reactionary thoughts of the exploiting classes, and establish the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

To revolt, we must prioritize breaking down barriers and daring to act without hesitation, fearlessly and boldly! In fighting the enemy, we fear neither hardship nor death; in transforming our thoughts, we must fear neither ugliness nor pain, and we must not protect our own shortcomings. Apart from the Party's cause, the people's interests, and the revolutionary situation, we have no personal gain. Whatever is beneficial to the revolution, we will do it. Personal fame, profit, power, position, glory, factionalism, and all such trash must be swept away! The class enemy tries to use various sugar-coated bullets to attack our souls and disintegrate our ranks, but that is absolutely impossible! We must firmly grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely drive out the "private" self, and let the "public" self take root. We must make up our minds to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought!

The comrades praised by Chairman Mao—Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Liu Huilan, and Lei Feng—these selfless and thorough proletarian revolutionary rebels have set a brilliant example for us. Revolutionary rebel comrades, we must strive a hundredfold!

    在灵魂深处大造反
    《新华日报》毛泽东思想战斗队争朝夕战斗组
    跟阶级敌人斗，我们不怕苦，不怕死。改造思想，我们更要不怕丑，不怕痛，不护短。我们除了党的事业，人民的利益，革命的大局以外，什么个人的名、利、权、位，什么争山头、出风头等等垃圾废物，统统叫它滚蛋！
      “无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界……”这是我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席的最高指示，我们坚决照办，坚决执行！
    我们是客观世界的革命造反者，我们也是主观世界的革命造反者。我们坚决遵循毛主席的教导，在改造客观世界的同时，加紧改造自己的主观世界，做一个完全彻底的革命造反者。
    人的主观世界（也就是思想）是客观世界的反映。毛主席说：“其中，尤以各种形式的阶级斗争，给予人的认识发展以深刻的影响。在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”例如：对待群众，把群众当作英雄呢，还是把自己当作“英雄”？对待胜利，是归功于党和毛主席呢，还是把功劳记在个人或小集团的帐上？对待革命造反派的队伍，是看作都是毛主席的战士呢，还是只看作“我”个人带起来的人马？对待兄弟革命组织，是平等相待、虚心学习呢，还是好的都归我，丑的是别人，“老子天下第一”？对待夺权，是为无产阶级夺权、为共产主义夺权呢，还是为个人夺权、为小集团夺权？总而言之，一事当前，是替别人打算呢，还是只替自己打算？从这些具体的问题上，反映了两种思想，即一个是无产阶级的新思想，一个是资产阶级的旧思想。新，就新在一个“公”字上；旧，就旧在一个“私”字上。这两种思想，冤家对头，势不两立。你不攻它，它就攻你，你不打它，它就打你，你不造它的反，它就造你的反。在我们的头脑中，不是无产阶级思想的天下，就是资产阶级思想的天下。调和、改良行不通，和平共处、公私合营办不到，必须要来一场思想上的革命大造反。
    林彪同志指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是要消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。”我们无产阶级革命造反派，要下定决心，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在自己的灵魂深处也要大闹革命。要大造其反，一反到底，横扫一切落后的、腐朽的、反动的剥削阶级旧思想，大立战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想！
    要造反，就要破字当头，敢字领先，毫无顾忌，豁出去干！对敌作战，我们不怕苦，不怕死；改造思想，我们更要不怕丑，不怕痛，不护短。我们除了党的事业，人民的利益，革命的大局以外，毫无私利。怎么样对革命有利，我们就怎么干。什么个人的名呀，利呀，权呀，位呀，风头呀，“山头”呀，等等垃圾废物，统统让它滚蛋！阶级敌人想用形形色色的糖衣炮弹轰击我们的灵魂，瓦解我们的队伍，那是绝对办不到的！我们要紧紧掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，坚决把“私”字扫地出门，让“公”字安家落户。我们一定要下定决心，学好用好毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑！
    毛主席所赞扬的张思德、白求恩、刘胡兰、雷锋，这些一心为公的、彻底的无产阶级革命造反者，他们已经为我们树立了光辉的榜样，革命造反派的战友们，我们要百倍地努力啊！
