Comrade Chen Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the rally in the capital to angrily denounce and strongly protest the Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody suppression of Chinese students and brutal beating of Chinese diplomatic personnel. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear comrades and revolutionary rebels from the front lines of the anti-revisionist struggle:

Hello!

Today, we are holding this rally to angrily denounce and strongly protest the Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody suppression of Chinese students who came to lay wreaths at Lenin and Stalin's tombs, and their savage acts of breaking into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union to commit vandalism, looting, and beating our diplomatic representatives and embassy staff. We also warmly welcome the victorious return of our students and comrades from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union. On behalf of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, I extend my warmest greetings and condolences to the heroic anti-revisionist fighters, and I salute you with the revolutionary greetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The Soviet revisionist leadership's frenzied suppression of Chinese students who came to lay wreaths at Lenin and Stalin's tombs, their organization of special agents and thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union to commit vandalism, looting, and beating our diplomatic representatives and embassy staff, is a rare fascist atrocity in the history of international diplomacy, and a serious provocation against the Chinese people. Such things happening in the homeland of the great October Revolution is a great insult to the great Soviet people and a great insult to the great Lenin!

The Soviet revisionist leadership is just a small clique of traitors to Marxism-Leninism and the number one accomplice of American imperialism. Their actions cannot represent the broad masses of the Soviet people. The Soviet people are a great people with a glorious revolutionary tradition; they want revolution and want to be friends with the Chinese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to sabotage the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union will only result in them lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet.

The Soviet revisionist leadership spreads rumors and slanders, distorts right and wrong, and attempts to sow discord between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world. However, the truth is on our side, and the people of the world have sharp eyes. The plots of the Soviet revisionist leadership are doomed to fail.

Regarding the Soviet revisionist leadership's trampling of the most basic norms of international relations and their serious sabotage of Sino-Soviet relations, our government has already issued a statement on February 5th, expressing the strongest protest and making the most solemn demands. However, in the past few days, the Soviet government has continued to take anti-China steps, provoking the Chinese people anew, and threatening to take further measures to sabotage bilateral relations. The Chinese people are closely watching the development of the situation. We must once again solemnly warn the Soviet government: the patience of the Chinese people has its limits. If you continue down the path of anti-China, you will definitely not have a good outcome.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is extremely hostile and fearful of the great Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and extremely hostile and fearful of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better, using the new victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to counter the Soviet revisionists' arrogant attacks.

Glory to the anti-revisionist fighters!

In the face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's fascist atrocities, you stood firm and fought bravely, defending the sovereignty and dignity of our great motherland, and defending the great Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. You are truly the good sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and truly loyal cadres and students to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Glory to the anti-revisionist fighters! You have just passed a severe test of international class struggle and returned to our country in the midst of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the height of the revolutionary masses uniting to seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road. New tasks of struggle lie before you. I hope you will continue to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and while transforming the objective world, strive to transform your subjective world, tempering yourselves into reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Together with the revolutionary people of the world, we will carry on the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership to the end, and make more contributions to the great cause of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Finally, let us shout:

Workers of the world, unite!

Down with American imperialism!

Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership!

Long live the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    陈毅同志在首都革命造反派愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行大会上讲话
    苏联政府妄图破坏中苏人民革命友谊
    其结果只能是搬起石头打自己的脚
    代表毛主席林副主席和党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组热烈欢迎和慰问胜利归来的反修战士
    新华社十一日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志在首都革命造反派愤怒声讨苏修法西斯暴行大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的来自反修斗争前线的同学们、同志们，革命造反派的战友们：
    你们好！
    今天，我们在这里举行大会，愤怒声讨和强烈抗议苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压我国留学生和毒打我国外交人员的野蛮暴行；热烈欢迎胜利归来的留学生和驻苏联大使馆的同志们。我代表我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委和中央文化革命小组，向英勇的反修战士们表示最亲切的慰问，并向你们致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗的敬礼！
    苏联修正主义领导集团疯狂镇压向列宁、斯大林墓献花圈的中国留学生，组织特务暴徒闯入中国驻苏联大使馆进行破坏，抢劫，毒打我国外交代表和大使馆人员，这是世界外交史上罕见的法西斯暴行，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。这样的事情，竟然发生在伟大十月革命的故乡，这是对伟大苏联人民的莫大侮辱，对伟大列宁的莫大侮辱！
    苏联修正主义领导集团只是一小撮马克思列宁主义的叛徒，是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。他们的所作所为，根本不能代表广大的苏联人民。苏联人民是具有光荣革命传统的伟大人民，他们是要革命的，是要同中国人民友好的。苏联修正主义领导集团妄图破坏中苏两国人民的革命友谊，其结果，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。
    苏联修正主义领导集团造谣诬蔑，颠倒是非，妄图挑拨中国人民同世界各国人民的友谊。但是，真理在我们这一边，世界人民的眼睛是雪亮的，苏联修正主义领导集团的阴谋是注定要失败的。
    对于苏联修正主义领导集团践踏起码的国际关系准则、严重破坏中苏两国关系的法西斯暴行，我国政府已经在二月五日发表声明，提出了最最强烈的抗议和严正的要求。但是，几天来，苏联政府还在层出不穷地采取着反华步骤，对中国人民进行新的挑衅，并且威胁要采取进一步破坏两国关系的措施。中国人民正在密切注视着事态的发展。我们要再一次严正警告苏联政府：中国人民的忍耐是有限度的。你们沿着反华的道路走下去，是绝对不会有好下场的。
    苏联修正主义领导集团极端仇视和害怕伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，极端仇视和害怕我国的无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，用无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利来回击苏联修正主义的猖狂进攻。
    光荣的反修战士们！
    你们在苏联修正主义领导集团的法西斯暴行面前，临危不惧，坚持斗争，捍卫了我们伟大祖国的主权和尊严，捍卫了伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。你们不愧是中国人民的好儿女，不愧是忠于伟大领袖毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的好干部、好学生。
    光荣的反修战士们：你们刚刚胜利地经住了一场严峻的国际阶级斗争的考验，现在，你们在我国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，在无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的高潮中，回到了祖国，回到了伟大领袖毛主席的身边。新的斗争任务摆在你们面前。希望你们进一步活学活用毛主席著作，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命，在改造客观世界的同时，努力改造自己的主观世界，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，同世界革命人民一道，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，为中国革命和世界革命的伟大事业作出更多的贡献。
    最后让我们高呼：
    全世界无产者联合起来！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！
    中苏两国人民的伟大友谊万岁！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
