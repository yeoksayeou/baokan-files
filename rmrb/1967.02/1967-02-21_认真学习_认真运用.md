Once, a delegation of Chinese students was invited by a French youth club to introduce the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They brought over a hundred copies of individual editions of Chairman Mao's works, which were immediately taken by the attendees. When they took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the audience's emotions surged, and everyone eagerly requested copies. At this moment, the club's leader stood on a stool, excitedly saying, "We must study the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' seriously and apply them seriously. We must also ensure that friends who did not get a copy can also read it."

    认真学习  认真运用
    有一次，中国学生代表团应一个法国青年俱乐部邀请去介绍中国文化大革命情况，他们带去的一百多本毛主席著作单行本，立即被到会的人索取一空。当他们拿出《毛主席语录》时，人们情绪沸腾，纷纷索要。这时俱乐部的负责人站到凳子上激动地说：“我们要认真学习《毛主席语录》，并且要认真运用，同时还要让没有得到的朋友都能读到。”
