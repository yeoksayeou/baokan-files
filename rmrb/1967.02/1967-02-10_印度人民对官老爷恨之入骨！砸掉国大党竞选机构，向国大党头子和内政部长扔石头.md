The Indian people have recently taken various actions to strongly oppose the election activities of the Congress Party, causing unprecedented chaos in the upcoming fourth general election.

In many places, the masses have smashed the election offices of the Congress Party and other reactionary parties, and thrown stones, bricks, and shoes at reactionary bureaucrats and politicians, disrupting their election speeches and rallies.

Recently, Home Minister Chavan was booed off the stage twice while delivering speeches in Jaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan. In Jodhpur, angry crowds threw stones at him and shouted, "Chavan, go back! We won't listen to you!" Chavan could only stop after speaking for three minutes.

Congress Party Chairman Kamaraj was hit on the forehead with a brick during an election rally in Tirupati in southern India. In Giridih, Bihar, some students burned down a small pavilion he had prepared to speak at a public gathering before he arrived.

Indian people demonstrated outside the Indian Parliament in New Delhi and bravely fought against reactionary police.

    印度人民对官老爷恨之入骨！
    砸掉国大党竞选机构，向国大党头子和内政部长扔石头
    据新华社八日讯　新德里消息：印度人民最近采取各种行动，强烈地反对国大党的竞选活动，使得不久就要举行投票的印度第四届大选陷入空前的混乱。
    许多地方的群众，砸了国大党和其它反动政党的竞选机构，并向那些反动官僚政客扔石块、砖头、鞋子，打断了他们的竞选演说和集会。
    内政部长恰范最近在拉贾斯坦邦的斋普尔和佐德浦尔两次发表演说时被群众轰下台。在佐德浦尔，愤怒的群众向他扔石头，并且高呼：“恰范滚回去！我们不听你讲话！”恰范讲了三分钟以后只得停止。
    国大党主席卡马拉季在印度南部的蒂鲁帕蒂地方的一次竞选集会上，被群众用砖块打中前额。在比哈尔邦的吉里德，一些学生在卡马拉季到那里去活动以前，烧掉了他准备在公众集会上讲话用的小棚。（附图片）
    印度人民在新德里印度议会外示威，并与反动警察进行英勇搏斗。
