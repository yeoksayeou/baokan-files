The Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee held a Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Great Alliance Great Seizure of Power Oath-Taking Rally on the 31st, during which a message of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao was passed. The full text of the message is as follows:

Our most, most, most, most beloved great leader, the reddest, reddest, reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao:

Today is the grandest day for the red rebels of Black Dragon River Province, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Black Dragon River Province, and the revolutionary masses. With hearts full of boundless excitement, we extend our most, most fervent greetings to you, wishing you eternal life, eternal life! We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand, ten thousand times long live!

You are our red commander, and we are your loyal little red soldiers. You have taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified" and, under your guidance, have risen up to fight. We have launched the most resolute struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and all the ghosts and monsters. We have deeply realized that if we only acknowledge the existence of class struggle in the socialist period but do not acknowledge the sharp and complex struggle to seize power in the socialist period, we cannot be a Red Guard of Mao Zedong Thought or a good soldier of Chairman Mao. Today, we have established the Black Dragon River Province Red Rebel Revolutionary Committee and seized all the powers of the Party, government, finance, and culture from the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists!

Black Dragon River Province is the eastern frontier of our country's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle and an important base for industrial and agricultural production. We have overthrown the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, removed their positions, and seized their power. A brand-new, red Black Dragon River Province has been born! The great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong shines brightly and strikes fear into the hearts of all, dealing a heavy blow to Soviet revisionism and the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, smashing their evil plot to attack the People's Republic of China from Black Dragon River Province, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and striking a heavy blow to the arrogance of the counter-revolutionary revisionists! Let the Soviet revisionists and the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, as well as the traitors within our country, cry and tremble in the face of the great victory of our heroic people!

In the struggle, we have deeply felt that, following your instructions, raising the banner of the great alliance and great seizure of power of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, uniting and combining all revolutionary forces on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible and victorious in all our endeavors.

"We should pursue the fleeing enemy with all our might, and not seek fame like the King of Chu." We are determined to hold high the torch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that you personally lit, to study diligently the "Three Articles" ("In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains") and other articles such as "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "Oppose Liberalism," and the "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," to raise our ideological awareness and improve our level of struggle, to build an extremely proletarianized and combat-ready army of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the victorious line of Chairman Mao's revolution!

Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!

Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao!

    黑龙江省红色造反者大联合大夺权誓师大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社哈尔滨一日电　黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会在三十一日举行的黑龙江省红色造反者大联合大夺权誓师大会上，通过了给我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。致敬电全文如下：我们最最最最敬爱的伟大领袖、我们心中最红、最红、最红的红太阳毛主席：
    今天是我们黑龙江省红色造反者、中国人民解放军黑龙江省驻军部队指战员和革命群众最盛大的节日。我们怀着无限激动的心情，最最热烈地祝福您万寿无疆，万寿无疆！一千遍一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
    您是我们的红司令，我们是您的忠实的红小兵。您教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们高举“造反有理”的大旗，在您的指引下，奋起战斗，向着党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，展开了最坚决的夺权斗争。我们深刻地认识到，只承认社会主义时期存在着阶级斗争，不承认社会主义时期尖锐、复杂的夺权斗争，就不能当一个毛泽东思想红卫兵和毛主席的好战士。今天我们成立了黑龙江省红色造反者革命委员会，从一小撮反革命修正主义分子手里，把黑龙江省的党、政、财、文等一切大权夺回到无产阶级革命造反派手中来！
    黑龙江省是祖国反帝反修的东北方前哨，是工农业生产的重要基地。我们斗倒了一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，罢了他们的官，夺了他们的权，一个崭新的红彤彤的黑龙江省诞生了！伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想光焰无际，威震四方，沉重地打击了苏联修正主义和美日反动派，粉碎了他们妄图从黑龙江省进攻中华人民共和国的罪恶阴谋，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了反革命修正主义分子的威风！让苏修和美日反动派以及国内那些丧心病狂的反动派在我们英雄人民的伟大胜利面前哭泣吧，发抖吧！
    我们在斗争中深深地体会到，遵照您的指示，高举无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的旗帜，在毛泽东思想的基础上，团结和联合一切革命力量，必将所向披靡，无往而不胜。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们决心高举您亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的火炬，努力学习“老三篇”（《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》）和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》等文章，提高思想觉悟，提高斗争艺术水平，建设一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的无产阶级文化革命造反大军，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    黑龙江省红色造反者大联合大夺权誓师大会
                      一九六七年一月三十一日
