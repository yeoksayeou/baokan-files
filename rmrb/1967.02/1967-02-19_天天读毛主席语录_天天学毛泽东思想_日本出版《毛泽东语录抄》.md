In the midst of the high tide of studying Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary people of Japan, the Eastern Bookstore, which specializes in selling progressive books and publications, has recently published "A Copy of Mao Zedong's Quotations" to facilitate the Japanese revolutionary people in using Chairman Mao's words as weapons of struggle, guiding lights, and guides for action every day.

To express their boundless admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, the cover of "A Copy of Mao Zedong's Quotations" features a photograph of Chairman Mao in military uniform, wearing a Red Guard armband, waving from Tiananmen Gate. Below the photograph is Chairman Mao's speech to visiting Japanese friends: "Apart from the monopolistic capitalists and militarist cliques in Japan that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends."

"A Copy of Mao Zedong's Quotations" is creatively printed by the Eastern Bookstore in response to the demands of Japanese readers who want to study Mao Zedong Thought and read Chairman Mao's quotations every day. It is about one and a half feet long and half a foot wide, making it convenient to hang on the wall and flip through every day. "A Copy of Mao Zedong's Quotations" includes a total of 31 quotations from Chairman Mao.

These quotations, which shine with the invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought, inspire the revolutionary people of Japan to fight with confidence against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, Japanese revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries.

The publisher's note in "A Copy of Mao Zedong's Quotations" states: "Let us, for 365 days a year, take Mao Zedong's words as our guiding light every day."
