The revolutionary rebels of Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, after seizing power, led all revolutionary workers in the factory to establish a new revolutionary order and achieve new production results. The entire factory made up for the losses caused by the sabotage activities of a small clique of bad elements in the previous stage within one week and overfulfilled the production plan for January.

	New China News Agency, Guiyang, February 6 – “The world belongs to us. The country belongs to us. Society belongs to us. If we do not speak, who will speak? If we do not do it, who will do it?” The proletarian revolutionary rebels of Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, following Chairman Mao’s great teachings, with the heroic spirit of proletarian revolutionary fighters, seized all the leadership powers from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the factory and led all revolutionary workers in the factory to grasp the revolution and promote production, overfulfilling the state plan for January this year.

	The Joint Command of the Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels of Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory achieved full seizure of power on January 24. Before the seizure of power, a small clique of capitalist-roaders among the leading cadres of this factory played tricks with counter-revolutionary economism, inciting a large number of workers to leave their production posts, attempting to shift the target of struggle, sabotage production, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. By January 24, the production task for the entire factory in January was only about half completed. Under these circumstances, the revolutionary rebels learned from the experience of the victorious struggle for power seizure by the proletarian revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, established the Joint Command of the Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels, and on January 24, fully seized the leadership powers of the party, government, production, finance, and other aspects of this factory.

	After seizing power, the rebel workers firmly carried out Chairman Mao’s great instruction of “grasp revolution, promote production,” announced the establishment of a new production command system and a temporary production committee, and required workers who had gone out for linking up to immediately return to their production posts. For middle-level and above leading cadres, the following policy was implemented: those who stubbornly insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution were ordered to go to the workshops to accept supervision from the masses and engage in labor; those with many problems but not very serious ones were absorbed into the production command system to work under the supervision of the revolutionary rebels. In this way, the production order of the entire factory was quickly restored. Under the unified leadership of the Joint Command of the Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels, the broad revolutionary workers raced against time, actively striving to complete the production task for January.

	After the proletarian revolutionary rebels took power, they broke through the revisionist framework that shackled productivity in production management, and eliminated formalism and bureaucratism. For example, in the past, when problems arose in production, reports had to be submitted to the section, and the section would then submit them to the factory department; many problems could not be solved in a timely manner. Now, problems are solved on the spot, quickly and effectively. In the past, if parts sent to the assembly workshop were missing or improperly processed, they had to be returned to the machine workshop for rework. Now, the broad revolutionary masses have shown high initiative, solving problems on the spot, greatly saving man-hours. In the past, if a certain type of work required additional labor, it had to be reported layer by layer to the factory department. Now, the entire factory has achieved communist cooperation, and some weak links have been quickly supported under this cooperation. The proletarian revolutionary rebels of this factory said: the past management institutions were specifically to supervise us workers, now we are the masters of the factory, we will thoroughly smash those revisionist management institutions and establish a new production order.

	After the revolutionary rebel workers of Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory took charge, they were full of enthusiasm. They made up for the losses in production in the previous stage within a short week and successfully completed the production task for diesel engines in January.

    贵州柴油机厂革命造反派夺权后带领全厂革命职工
    建立革命新秩序　创造生产新成绩
    全厂一星期内就弥补起前一阶段由于一小撮坏家伙的破坏活动造成的损失，超额完成一月份生产计划
    新华社贵阳六日电　“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命造反派遵循毛主席这一伟大教导，以无产阶级革命战士的英雄气概，夺了厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切领导大权后，带领全厂革命职工，抓革命促生产，超额完成了今年一月份的国家计划。
    贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命造反派联合司令部是在一月二十四日实现全面夺权的。在夺权以前，这个厂的领导干部中一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大肆玩弄反革命经济主义的阴谋，煽动大批职工离开生产工作岗位，企图转移斗争目标，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。到一月二十四日止，全厂一月份生产任务还只完成一半左右。在这种情况下，革命造反派学习了上海无产阶级革命造反派夺权斗争胜利的经验，成立无产阶级革命造反派联合司令部，于一月二十四日全面夺了这个厂的党、政、生产、财务等领导大权。
    夺权以后，革命造反派工人坚决贯彻毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，宣布成立新的生产指挥系统和临时生产委员会，并且要求外出串连的职工立即回到生产岗位。对于中层以上的领导干部实行了以下政策：勒令在文化大革命中顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的当权派，到车间接受群众监督，从事劳动；问题多但还不很严重的，吸收他们在生产指挥系统中，在革命造反派的监督下进行工作。这样，全厂生产秩序迅速恢复起来。广大革命职工在革命造反派联合司令部的统一领导下，争分抢秒，积极争取完成一月份的生产任务。
    无产阶级革命造反派掌权以后，在生产管理上冲破了修正主义的那一套束缚生产力的框框套套，破除了形式主义、文牍主义。比如过去生产中发生问题，要先打报告交科室，科室再提交厂部，许多问题因而不能及时解决；现在出了问题就在现场解决，又快又好。过去，送到装配车间的零件有漏加工或者加工不合格的，要退回机加工车间返修；现在广大革命群众发挥了高度积极性，就地设法返修，大大节省了工时。过去某工种要求增添劳力，必须层层上报厂部，现在全厂实现了共产主义大协作，一些薄弱环节在大协作下，得到了迅速的支援。这个厂的无产阶级革命造反派说：过去的管理机构是专门监督我们工人的，现在我们是工厂的主人，过去那些修正主义的管理机构我们要彻底砸碎，建立起新的生产秩序。
    贵州柴油机厂革命造反派工人当家作主后，干劲冲天，他们在短短一个星期内就弥补了前一阶段生产上所造成的损失，胜利地完成了一月份柴油机的生产任务。
