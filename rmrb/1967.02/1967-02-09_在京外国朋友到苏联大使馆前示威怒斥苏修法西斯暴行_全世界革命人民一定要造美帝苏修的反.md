Foreign friends in Beijing, along with revolutionary rebels and people from all walks of life in the capital, strongly condemned the savage fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist authorities. They gathered in front of the Soviet Embassy to protest and denounce the Soviet revisionists' barbaric actions.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, the Soviet revisionist leadership instigated thugs to storm the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, brutally beating Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff. This shocking anti-China incident has infuriated friends from five continents who are in Beijing. They joined the revolutionary rebels and people from all walks of life in the capital to strongly condemn the Soviet authorities' extremely savage fascist atrocities.

This evening, more than sixty revolutionary experts from over ten countries who are helping with China's construction in Beijing, held high portraits of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, carried red-bound copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and held up many anti-revisionist slogans written in various languages. They came to the front of the Soviet Embassy in China to protest. In front of the Soviet Embassy, they read out a public letter to the Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin in English, French, and Spanish.

The public letter stated: Revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists have been brutally beaten in Lenin's homeland. This action exposes the counter-revolutionary fascist nature of Soviet revisionism. You are traitors to the world revolution, traitors to Lenin's cause, and enemies of all oppressed peoples worldwide, as well as international scabs.

In front of the Soviet Embassy, friends from various countries spoke to reporters. A representative from the "Mao Zedong Thought International Prairie Fire Rebel Corps" composed of Japanese experts said in an interview that the Soviet revisionist leadership's extreme ferocity shows that they fear China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Mao Zedong Thought. It also shows that they are very weak!

French friend Anna Bahon and Swiss friend Luciette Graichbe expressed great indignation at the Soviet revisionists' continuous anti-China incidents. They pointed out that the Soviet revisionists are as bad as imperialism! They expressed their firm belief that the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought will guide the Soviet people to rise up and fight.

Brazilian expert Galiano, who works in Beijing, pointed out that the Brazilian people have already realized that regardless of whether revisionism and reactionaries want it or not, the people will definitely revolt. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will shine all over the world!

Belgian friend Be Lake came to the Soviet Embassy, filled with righteous indignation, and repeatedly led the foreign friends in chanting in Chinese and French, "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Brezhnev!"

Holding high a portrait of Chairman Mao, South African friend Land told reporters that the fate of Soviet revisionists is the same as that of all oppressors and fascists. They will definitely be trampled underfoot by the oppressed people of the world. He expressed his firm belief that the people of the world, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely rise up against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism and will definitely win.

An American friend expressed in an interview his belief that the great Soviet people will definitely rise up to overthrow the new tsars—Brezhnev and Kosygin—who are riding on their heads. Mao Zedong Thought will lead revolutionaries all over the world to victory.

    在京外国朋友到苏联大使馆前示威怒斥苏修法西斯暴行
    全世界革命人民一定要造美帝苏修的反
    据新华社八日讯　苏修领导集团指使暴徒闯进我国驻苏联大使馆毒打我国外交代表和工作人员，又一次制造骇人听闻的反华事件，激起了在北京的五大洲各国朋友的无比愤怒，他们同首都革命造反派和各界革命群众一起，强烈谴责苏修当局野蛮透顶的法西斯暴行。
    今天晚间，在北京帮助我国建设的十多个国家的六十多位革命专家，高举着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，擎着许多用各国文字写的反修标语牌，来到苏联驻我国大使馆门前示威。他们在苏联大使馆门前，用英语、法语、西班牙语宣读了他们给苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金的公开信。
    公开信说：革命者，马克思列宁主义者在列宁的故乡遭到了残暴的殴打，这一行动暴露了你们苏联修正主义的反革命法西斯的本性。你们是世界革命的叛徒，列宁的事业的叛徒，世界一切被压迫人民的敌人和国际工贼。
    在苏联大使馆门前，各国朋友纷纷向记者发表谈话。由日本专家组成的“毛泽东思想国际燎原造反队”的代表在谈话中说，苏修领导集团这样穷凶极恶，说明他们害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命，害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，也说明他们十分虚弱！
    法国朋友安娜·巴洪和瑞士朋友吕赛特·葛莱希贝对苏修连续地制造反华事件感到万分愤慨，她们指出，苏修的所作所为说明了它们和帝国主义一样坏！她们表示坚信，伟大的光芒四射的毛泽东思想，定会指导苏联人民起来进行斗争。
    在北京工作的巴西专家加里亚诺指出，巴西人民已经清楚地认识到，不管修正主义和反动派愿意不愿意，人民总是要革命的。毛泽东思想的光辉将普照全球！
    比利时朋友贝湖来到苏修使馆前，义愤填膺，不停地用中国话和法语领着外国朋友们疾呼：“打倒苏修！”“打倒勃列日涅夫！”
    高举着毛主席画像的南非朋友兰德对记者说，苏联修正主义者的命运跟一切压迫者和法西斯一样，必将被全世界受压迫的人民踩在脚下。他表示坚信，用马列主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的全世界革命人民，一定要造美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的反，而且一定会胜利。
    一位美国朋友在谈话中表示相信，伟大的苏联人民必将奋起推翻骑在他们头上的新沙皇——勃列日涅夫和柯西金。毛泽东思想将引导全世界的革命者走向胜利。
