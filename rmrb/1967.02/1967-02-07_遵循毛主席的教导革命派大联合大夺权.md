On January 22, a thunderous roar erupted on the eastern coast of China, shaking the entire city of Qingdao. The revolutionary rebels of Qingdao solemnly declared: the "Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee," with 23 revolutionary organizations at its core, had seized power from a handful of bourgeois elements in the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee. This seizure of power is correct and well-deserved! It is a great joy for the 1 million people of Qingdao and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, had implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they stubbornly pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, inciting masses to fight against each other, and practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the broad revolutionary masses, fully exposing their reactionary nature. The strength of the revolutionary rebels grew in the struggle. The conditions for seizing power were ripe.

Chairman Mao teaches us to dare to struggle and dare to win. The time for seizing power has come. Do we dare to seize power or not? This is the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones and the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and opportunism. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers of Qingdao, led by the "Qingdao Branch of the National Revolutionary Red Guards Liaison Headquarters," initiated a decisive and resolute revolutionary action, uniting with the revolutionary masses of the entire city. They did not give the enemy any breathing room, fought a brilliant battle, and seized the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers of the entire city of Qingdao. The fundamental path to the victory of the Qingdao proletarian revolutionary seizure of power is to achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

The great unity of the Qingdao revolutionary forces grew from small to large and from weak to strong, gradually developing through struggle. After Chairman Mao personally decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism nationwide, the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao burned fiercely. The student movement was the first to rise up, forming their own revolutionary organizations through struggle. They grasped the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle against the Party committees of the schools and the handful of capitalist roaders within the provincial and municipal Party committees, and withstood several encirclements planned by the provincial and municipal Party committees. They grew stronger in battle. The workers' and peasants' movements rapidly developed, like a sudden storm, irresistible. The rebel forces of the municipal organs also rapidly expanded. Various revolutionary rebel organizations sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, standing on the coast of the East China Sea, launching fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line within the Municipal Party Committee.

However, a handful of bad elements in the Municipal Party Committee were not willing to admit defeat. They planned the "August 25," "September 1," and November counter-revolutionary incidents, suppressing the student movement, encircling the revolutionary leftists, and labeling a large number of revolutionary masses who posted big-character posters against them as "counter-revolutionaries." They used their puppet organizations to do everything possible to strike at the revolutionary rebels, directing their spearheads at comrades like Deputy Mayor Wang Xiaoyu of Qingdao, who firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They attempted to reverse the wheel of history and extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Qingdao proletariat. Chairman Mao said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The conspiratorial activities of the handful of bad elements in the provincial and municipal Party committees further exposed their ugly faces of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The severe class struggle educated the revolutionary rebels, making them realize that in the struggle to seize power, the proletarian revolutionary forces must continuously expand their ranks, unite all those willing to revolutionize, achieve great unity, and form a vast proletarian revolutionary army. This great unity must be a fighting unity, a principled unity, a unity based on the common foundation of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The great unity of the Qingdao revolutionary forces went through a tortuous struggle. The white terror created by the provincial and municipal Party committees, and the two-faced, divisive, threatening, and enticing tactics adopted by the provincial and municipal Party committees, caused confusion among some revolutionary masses and created rifts between revolutionary organizations.

Within the revolutionary organizations, some wrong ideas emerged, such as localism, sectarianism, ultra-democracy, and individualism, which hindered the great unity of the revolutionary rebels. On January 5, a meeting to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of the provincial and municipal Party committees was disrupted halfway by some organizations. In mid-January, various revolutionary organizations held another meeting to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Due to the lack of true great unity of the revolutionary forces, many organizations fought individually and did not achieve the expected results.

All this deeply educated the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses. Every revolutionary or revolutionary organization must, in this soul-stirring Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fight against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, and at the same time, wage an uncompromising struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideas in their minds and ranks, and never allow them to spread freely, otherwise, they will bring incalculable losses to the revolutionary cause. The Qingdao revolutionary rebels studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, criticized and overcame those bourgeois elements, further united under the direction of seizing power, and established the unified Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee. The revolutionary rebels dared to split and break away from a few opportunistic organizations, even those that colluded with the capitalist roaders. This strengthened the purity and fighting power of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

In the struggle for the proletarian revolutionary forces to unite and seize power, it is necessary to attach importance to the role of revolutionary leading cadres. These leading comrades insisted on the proletarian revolutionary line and fought against the capitalist roaders for a long time. They stood firmly, consistently supported the proletarian revolutionary forces, fought shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses, and had high prestige, actually becoming the leaders of the revolutionary masses. Comrade Wang Xiaoyu, Deputy Mayor of Qingdao, is such a comrade. Because he firmly supported the revolutionary masses, he was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by a handful of bad elements in the provincial and municipal Party committees, illegally detained, and subjected to repeated attacks and strikes. However, he always followed Chairman Mao's instructions and revolted with the masses. Comrade Wang Xiaoyu's struggle received widespread support from the revolutionary masses and greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power, the consolidation of power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary forces must consolidate power, smash the counter-revolutionary forces' counterattacks against the proletariat, further strengthen unity, and strengthen the union, continuously develop and expand their ranks.

To unite the majority and develop the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and correctly handle the contradictions among the people. Differences of opinion among the masses or mass organizations can be united through discussion and consultation under the premise of a consistent direction. In the conservative organizations, many deceived masses have awakened or are awakening after the seizure of power. They have revolted from within and risen in rebellion, supporting the revolutionary forces' seizure of power and requesting to join the revolutionary rebel organizations. The proletarian revolutionary forces do not reject or discriminate against them but welcome them warmly. For some secondary leaders, after they admit their mistakes, they are generally not excessively pursued.

Some organizations, due to the serious development of localism, sectarianism, and sectarianism, were used by those with ulterior motives and went in the wrong direction of opposing the revolutionary forces' united seizure of power. The proletarian revolutionary forces, through mass debates, resolutely repelled their attacks on the Revolutionary Rebel Committee from a political and ideological standpoint. However, these organizations themselves have the possibility of developing in two different directions. Therefore, they are still allowed to exist organizationally and be rectified and improved.

In this way, the proletarian revolutionary forces have united and won over the majority of the masses, completely isolated a handful of stubborn elements, and expanded the mass base of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

After the proletarian revolutionary forces of Qingdao seized power, a handful of capitalist roaders and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line were terrified and hated it to the core. They incited and instigated the organizations and masses under their control, even colluded with the local, rich, counter-revolutionary, bad, and rightist elements in society, attacking and destroying the Qingdao Daily and the Qingdao People's Radio Station. They also attacked revolutionary organizations, destroyed state property, and incited workers to stop production.

The proletarian revolutionary forces of Qingdao united the broad masses and firmly implemented proletarian dictatorship against these handful of counter-revolutionary elements who operated and commanded from behind the scenes, resolutely banned reactionary organizations like the "Red Flag Army." This dictatorship is completely necessary. It is complementary to further strengthening and expanding the great unity of the revolutionary forces.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao responded to Chairman Mao's great battle call, firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces. In the struggle to repel the counterattacks of the class enemies, they showed great power. They actively supported the struggles of the revolutionary forces, guarded key departments such as water plants, power plants, and radio stations at critical moments of seizing power, ensuring revolutionary order and the normal economic life of the people.

Qingdao is located on the front line of coastal defense, with relatively concentrated industry. Doing well in industrial and agricultural production is of great significance for supporting socialist construction and national defense construction. Before the seizure of power, under the efforts of the broad revolutionary workers and peasants of Qingdao, the production situation was good. After the seizure of power, the Revolutionary Rebel Committee immediately held a citywide "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" rally, focusing on production and combating economism. The broad revolutionary rebel workers are further displaying their sense of ownership, working selflessly, and striving to overfulfill production tasks. They said they would definitely repay Chairman Mao's great concern for the revolutionary people of Qingdao with actual actions and fight a brilliant battle on the production front!

"Four seas churning, clouds and waters raging, five continents shaking, winds and thunder roaring."

The victory of the "January 22" seizure of power is a qualitative leap in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of Qingdao and a new starting point for the comprehensive development of class struggle in Qingdao. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate the achievements of the seizure of power, expand the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    遵循毛主席的教导革命派大联合大夺权
    青岛市革命造反委员会
    今年一月二十二日，一声惊雷在祖国的东海边爆发，震撼了整个青岛。青岛市无产阶级革命造反派庄严宣告：以二十三个革命组织为核心的“青岛市革命造反委员会”，夺了青岛市委、市人委一小撮资产阶级老爷们的权。这个权夺得对，夺得好！这是青岛市一百万人民的大喜事，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    前青岛市委，在一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子把持下，贯彻执行了一条反革命修正主义路线。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，对广大革命群众实行资产阶级专政，彻底暴露了他们的反动面目。革命造反派的力量在斗争中不断壮大。夺权的条件成熟了。
    毛主席教导我们，要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。夺权时机已经成熟，敢不敢夺权，是真革命和假革命的试金石，是马克思列宁主义和机会主义的分水岭。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，由青岛“全国革命造反红卫兵联络总部青岛轻工分部”革命工人首先发起的、同全市无产阶级革命派大联合，采取坚决果断的革命行动，不给敌人以喘息之机，打了个漂亮仗，一举夺取了全青岛市的党、政、财、文大权。青岛市无产阶级革命派夺权胜利的根本道路，就是按照毛主席的教导，实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    青岛市革命派的大联合，是从小到大，从弱到强，逐步在斗争中发展起来的。在毛主席亲自决定发表全国第一张马列主义大字报以后，青岛无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火迅猛地燃烧起来。最先起来的是学生运动，他们在斗争中形成自己的革命组织。他们掌握了斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头集中指向学校党委和省、市委内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，并顶住了省市委阴谋策划的数次围攻，在战斗中越战越强。工人运动、农民运动迅速发展起来，其势如暴风骤雨，锐不可当。市级机关干部造反派队伍也迅速壮大。各种革命造反组织如雨后春笋，林立在东海之滨，对市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子发起了猛烈的攻击。
    但是，市委中一小撮坏家伙不甘心他们的失败。他们有计划、有组织、有目的地策划了“八·二五”“九·一”及十一月份的反革命事件，镇压学生运动，围剿革命左派，把大批给他们贴大字报的革命群众，打成“反革命”。他们利用御用组织，千方百计地打击革命造反派，把矛头指向坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边的青岛副市长王效禹等同志。他们妄想扭转历史车轮，扑灭青岛市无产阶级的革命烈火。毛主席说，一切反动派都是“搬起石头打自己的脚”的蠢人。省、市委中一小撮坏家伙这些阴谋活动，进一步暴露了他们的反革命修正主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    严重的阶级斗争，教育了革命造反派，使他们认识到，无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中，必须不断扩大自己的队伍，团结一切愿意革命的同志，实行大联合，组成浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军。这种大联合，必须是战斗的联合，有原则的联合，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的共同基础上的联合。
    青岛市革命造反派的大联合，经历一番曲折的斗争过程。省市委制造白色恐怖，省市委所采取的两面三刀、分化瓦解、威胁利诱等手段，引起了一些革命群众的思想混乱，造成了革命组织之间的隔阂。
    在革命组织内部，产生了某些错误思想，小团体主义、风头主义、极端民主化、个人主义，妨碍了革命造反派的大联合。一月五日，全市召开批判省、市委资产阶级反动路线大会，半途被某些组织冲散了。一月中旬各革命组织又一次召开批判资产阶级反动路线大会，由于没有真正实现革命派大联合，许多组织各自为战，又未能取得预期的效果。
    这一切，深深教育了无产阶级革命派和广大群众。每一个革命者或革命组织，在这场触及灵魂的文化大革命中，都必须在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子作斗争的同时，又要向自己头脑里、队伍中的形形色色资产阶级思想作不调和的斗争，绝不能让它自由泛滥，否则，必将对革命事业带来不可估量的损失。青岛市革命造反派活学活用毛主席著作，批判和克服了那些资产阶级的东西，在夺权的大方向下，进一步联合起来，成立了统一的青岛市革命造反委员会。革命造反派对少数机会主义的、甚至与走资本主义道路的当权派同流合污的组织，敢于同它们分化、决裂。这样就加强了无产阶级革命派大联合的纯洁性和战斗力。
    在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的斗争中，必须重视革命领导干部的作用。这些领导同志坚持无产阶级革命路线，同走资本主义道路的当权派进行了长时期的斗争。他们立场鲜明，一贯支持无产阶级革命派，同革命群众并肩战斗，有较高的威信，实际上已成为革命群众的领导。青岛市副市长王效禹同志就是这样一个同志，由于他坚决支持群众革命，曾被省、市委一小撮坏人打成“反革命”，非法扣押，受过多次围攻、打击，但是，他始终按照毛主席的指示，同群众在一起闹革命。王效禹同志的斗争，得到革命群众的广泛支持，同时，也大大地鼓舞了革命群众的斗志。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”无产阶级革命派在夺权后，要巩固政权，粉碎反动势力向无产阶级的反扑，必须进一步加强团结，加强联合，不断发展和壮大自己的队伍。
    为了团结大多数，发展革命队伍，必须遵循毛主席的教导，正确处理人民内部矛盾。群众或群众组织之间持有不同意见，在大方向一致的前提下，经过讨论、协商完全可以团结起来。在保守派组织中，许多受蒙蔽的群众，在夺权以后，已经或正在觉醒，他们从内部造了反、起了义，拥护革命派夺权，要求加入革命造反派组织。无产阶级革命派对他们不是排斥、歧视，而是热烈的欢迎。对一些次要的头面人物，在他们承认错误之后，一般也不过分追究。
    一些组织由于山头主义、小团体主义、风头主义的严重发展，被别有用心的人从中利用，走到了反对革命派联合夺权的错误方向。无产阶级革命派通过群众性的大辩论，从政治思想上坚决打退了他们对革命造反委员会的进攻。但是，这些组织本身具有向两个不同方向发展的可能性。因此，在组织上还允许他们继续存在，整顿提高。
    这样，无产阶级革命派就团结争取了群众的大多数，彻底孤立了一小撮顽固分子，扩大了无产阶级革命派大联合的群众基础。
    青岛无产阶级革命派夺取大权后，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，怕得要死，恨之入骨，他们疯狂向革命造反委员会反扑。他们唆使、挑动受其控制的组织和不明真相的群众，甚至同社会上地、富、反、坏、右分子狼狈为奸，围攻、破坏《青岛日报》和青岛人民广播电台。他们还袭击革命派的组织，破坏国家财产，煽动职工停止生产。
    青岛市无产阶级革命派团结了广大群众，对这一小撮在幕前幕后操纵指挥的反革命分子，坚决实行了无产阶级专政，坚决取缔了象“红旗军”之类的反动组织。这种专政是完全必要的。这同进一步加强和扩大革命派的大联合是相辅相成的。
    人民解放军驻青岛部队，响应毛主席的伟大战斗号召，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，在打退阶级敌人反扑的斗争中，显示了巨大的威力。他们主动支援革命派的斗争，在夺权的紧要时刻，警卫了水厂、电厂、电台等要害部门，保证了革命秩序和人民的正常经济生活。
    青岛地处海防前哨，工业比较集中，搞好工农业生产，对于支援社会主义建设和国防建设，都具有重大意义。夺权前，在青岛广大革命工农群众的努力下，生产形势是好的。夺权后，革命造反委员会立即召开了全市“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会，狠抓生产，狠反经济主义。广大革命造反派职工，正在进一步发挥主人翁气概，忘我劳动，争取超额完成生产任务。他们说，一定要用实际行动报答伟大领袖毛主席对青岛革命人民的巨大关怀，在生产战线上打一个漂亮仗！
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”
    “一·二二”夺权的胜利，是青岛无产阶级文化大革命的一个质的飞跃，是青岛市全面展开阶级斗争的一个新的起点。我们一定要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，巩固夺权成果，扩大无产阶级革命派的大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
