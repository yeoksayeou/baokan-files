Edition: 2

Since the Cultural Revolution of the rural proletariat began, some regions' capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have adopted a soft and hard resistance attitude. They do not properly lead production, pushing and dodging whenever they encounter issues. In reality, these people are not unwilling to be cadres and are not genuinely willing to step down. Instead, they want to use shirking responsibilities to intimidate people, to use shirking responsibilities to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, sabotage production, and preserve their positions. This is their new crime.

The poor and lower-middle peasants are the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words. The revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought absolutely cannot let this small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party's tricks succeed. We must timely expose and give a powerful counterattack to their destructive activities.

We also warn all cadres who have made mistakes: shirking responsibilities is a crime! You should humbly accept the criticism of the masses, and at the same time, genuinely lead production well, thus making amends for your mistakes. Cadres who have made serious mistakes should also work hard to redeem themselves. If the production leadership cadre is not complete, we will complete it. If the production leadership cadre is paralyzed, we will organize our own structures to grasp revolution and promote production, taking on the leadership work of pre-spring plowing and spring production.

The spring production season is approaching. All revolutionary rebel organizations in the countryside should unite, resolutely repel the new counterattacks of the class enemy, and resolutely implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao. We will fight against all phenomena that are not conducive to the current movement and production. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, grasp the revolution, promote production vigorously, and strive for double victories in revolution and production!

    对撂挑子的行为给以有力反击
    农村的无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，有些地区的党内走资本主义道路的当权派采取软磨硬抗的态度，生产也不好好领导了，遇事能推就推，能躲就躲。其实，这些家伙并不是不愿当干部，并非真心愿意下台，而是想用撂挑子吓唬人，想用撂挑子破坏文化大革命，破坏生产，保住自己的地位。这是他们的新罪行。
    贫下中农是最听毛主席的话的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派，绝不能让这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派的阴谋诡计得逞。对于这些坏蛋的破坏活动，我们要及时识破，给以有力的反击。
    我们也要警告所有犯错误的干部：撂挑子就是犯罪！你们应当虚心听取群众的批评，同时切实领导好生产，这样来将功补过。犯有严重错误的干部，也应当好好工作，将功赎罪。生产领导班子不健全的，我们把它健全起来，生产领导班子瘫痪了的，我们就自己组织抓革命、促生产的机构，把备耕和春耕生产的领导工作担当起来。
    春耕生产季节就要到了。农村各革命造反派组织联合起来，坚决打退阶级敌人的新反扑，坚决贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，向各种不利于当前运动和生产的现象进行斗争。我们要活学活用毛主席著作，大抓革命，狠促生产，争取革命和生产的双胜利！
