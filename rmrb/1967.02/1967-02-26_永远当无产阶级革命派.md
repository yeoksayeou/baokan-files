The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanxi Province have united to seize power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. This is a heartening event. I raise my hands in joy: Excellent! Excellent! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in Shanxi Province! This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The leadership power seized by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee should have been taken away long ago. They regarded our Dazhai Brigade as a thorn in their side. During the socialist education movement, they implemented a line that was "left" in form but right in essence, spreading rumors, shooting dark arrows, holding secret meetings, writing black materials, and attempting to destroy Dazhai. We firmly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, trusted the masses, relied on the masses, and resolutely resisted their counter-revolutionary revisionist line. When they implemented the revisionist line, the revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai engaged in fierce struggles with them, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought forever occupies the Dazhai position.

The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee failed in their attempt to implement a line that was "left" in form but right in essence in Dazhai. However, they were not willing to give up. A couple of years ago, they again picked on Dazhai's problems, fabricating lies about Dazhai's per-acre yield being false, continuing to oppose the people of Dazhai, and attempting to topple the red flag of Dazhai. The revolutionary masses of Dazhai again engaged in a resolute and life-or-death struggle with them, exposing their reactionary faces to the world.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when revolutionary peasants responded to Chairman Mao's call to open fire on the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they used the excuse of being busy with production and having heavy tasks to obstruct peasants from participating in the Cultural Revolution. We broke through these obstacles and joined the Cultural Revolution battle. They then raised the banner of counter-revolutionary economism, using the pretext of caring for and supporting peasants to corrupt them with money; they also incited conflicts between workers and peasants, encouraging peasants to leave their production posts and rush to the cities. These ferocious counterattacks were all repulsed by us. Later, they incited peasants to "rebel" over the year-end distribution issue, attempting to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and agricultural production. The people of Dazhai saw through their tricks and did not fall for them.

We engage in revolution and construction to support the thorough liberation of oppressed class brothers around the world. We will not forget the billions of class brothers still suffering oppression just because we have been liberated. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolution should support the struggle of those who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Therefore, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly handle the relationships between the state, the collective, and the members, develop the socialist collective economy, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We will, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely follow the leadership of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebellion General Headquarters, and unite with revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals to seize all the party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by the capitalist-roaders. Only in this way can the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people truly become masters of the country; only in this way can we firmly grasp the seal of proletarian dictatorship in our hands.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not retreat from the historical stage of their own accord." We have implemented the "three-in-one combination" to seize back the power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, but they are not willing to admit defeat and will secretly collude to counterattack the revolutionary rebels. We will not relax our vigilance against the enemy because of victory. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," serving as both revolutionary vanguards and production pioneers. If the enemy dares to counterattack and disrupt production, we will resolutely make them perish!

    永远当无产阶级革命派
    山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵
    山西省无产阶级革命派联合起来夺了山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，这是大快人心的好事。我举起双手欢呼：好得很！好得很！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在山西省的伟大胜利！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派霸占的领导权，早就该夺。他们把我们大寨大队看作眼中钉，肉中刺。在社会主义教育运动中，他们推行形“左”实右的路线，造谣言，放暗箭，开黑会，写黑材料，妄想把大寨搞垮。我们坚决地执行了毛主席的革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，坚决抵制了他们的反革命修正主义路线。在他们推行修正主义路线的时候，大寨革命的贫下中农，同他们展开了激烈的斗争，让毛泽东思想永远占领大寨这个阵地。
    山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在大寨推行形“左”实右的路线失败了。但是他们并不甘心。前两年，又挑剔大寨的毛病，凭空捏造大寨亩产量不实，继续和大寨人为敌，企图把大寨这面红旗推倒。我们大寨的革命群众又向他们作了一次坚决的、拚死的斗争，才把他们的反动面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，当革命的农民响应毛主席的号召，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开火时，他们借口生产忙，任务大，阴谋阻止农民参加文化大革命。我们冲破了阻力，投入文化大革命战斗后，他们又打出了反革命经济主义的破旗，打着关心照顾农民的幌子，用金钱来腐蚀农民；他们还挑起工人与农民之间的矛盾，煽动农民离开生产岗位，涌向城市。这些猖狂的反扑，都被我们打退了。后来他们又煽动农民在年终分配问题上造“反”，企图达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命和农业生产的目的。我们大寨人又识破了他们的阴谋诡计，没有上他们的当。
    我们闹革命搞建设，为的是支援世界上受压迫的阶级兄弟的彻底解放，我们决不会因为自己解放了，就忘记了世界上亿万个仍在受压迫的阶级兄弟。毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”因此，我们按照毛主席的教导，正确处理国家、集体、社员的关系，发展社会主义集体经济，巩固无产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们要在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，坚决在山西革命造反总指挥部的领导下，和革命工人、革命学生、革命干部、革命知识分子联合起来，把那些走资本主义道路的当权派霸占的党、政、财、文权统统夺到无产阶级革命派手里。只有这样，我们无产阶级和广大劳动人民才能真正当家作主；只有这样，我们才能把无产阶级专政的大印牢牢地掌握在我们手里。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”我们实行“三结合”，把山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权夺回来了，但他们是不甘心失败的，他们还会暗中勾结，向革命造反派进行反扑。我们决不因为胜利而放松对敌人的警惕性。我们要坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，既作革命尖兵，又作生产闯将，如果敌人胆敢反扑，破坏生产，我们就坚决叫他灭亡！
