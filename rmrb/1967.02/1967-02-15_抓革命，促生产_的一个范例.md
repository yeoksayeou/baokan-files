The current situation in Shanghai, where the proletarian revolutionary factions have seized power comprehensively, presents a very good scenario. In this new situation, how the revolutionary rebels can grasp and use power well, and how to achieve double victories in revolution and production, has become an urgent problem to be solved. The experience of Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 provides an example for the revolutionary rebels throughout the city.

Once the working class of Shanghai seized all power from the authorities who were taking the capitalist road, the boundless socialist enthusiasm hidden within the masses erupted like a volcano, rapidly changing the face of production. The authorities within the party who were taking the capitalist road in Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 had ruined the factory's production to an unimaginable extent. In the first 14 days of January, the completed production tasks were only 9.2% of the monthly plan. However, once the revolutionary rebels seized power, the situation changed dramatically. In 16 days, they completed 90.8% of the monthly plan. Among these, they completed 50% of the monthly plan in just five days. This figure shows the sky-high enthusiasm of the Shanghai working class. It also foreshadows that after the proletarian revolutionary factions seize power, our socialist construction will enter an extraordinarily high-speed development phase.

The experience of Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 tells us that after seizing power, we must continue to grasp the revolution and never relax our criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, exposing the heinous crimes of a small clique within the party who were taking the capitalist road and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. By firmly grasping the revolution, the masses can educate themselves through struggle, making the revolutionary rebel spirit more and more accessible to the broad masses, turning their intense hatred of the bourgeois reactionary line into a powerful force to promote production.

After seizing power, we must firmly implement the policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and vigorously promote production. This meets the demands of the broad revolutionary masses and embodies the interests of the masses. Implementing the policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" and striving to improve production is an important aspect of consolidating the regime and an important guarantee for us to stand unshakable. We must never take this lightly. The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 mobilized the masses and vigorously promoted production, winning the trust of the broad revolutionary employees and gradually consolidating the regime.

Chairman Mao said: "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, avoiding problems is not an option; we must solve problems with an active attitude. Any human difficulty can be overcome." This is exactly the case. The working class has achieved remarkable results, giving the bourgeois gentlemen a resounding slap in the face. Apart from engaging in reactionary activities, the bourgeois gentlemen are good for nothing. They cannot weave a single inch of cloth or drive a single mile. Once we kick them out, our lives will be much better!

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 dared to break the old rules and regulations that shackle the development of productive forces. This revolutionary spirit is excellent! We are thorough revolutionaries. After seizing power, we do not seek easy gains or pursue a peaceful transition. All old organizational structures, old work systems, and everything that hinders the development of social productive forces, we will all smash to pieces. Break first, then establish. Only by thoroughly destroying the old system can we truly establish a new order. It is precisely because this factory changed the production relations to adapt to the development of productive forces that the face of production underwent a rapid and tremendous change.

After the revolutionary rebels seize power, there are thousands and tens of thousands of things to do, but the most fundamental thing is to study Chairman Mao's works well and arm the revolutionary rebels with Mao Zedong Thought. The worker revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 always paid attention to not being tainted by bureaucratic tendencies, maintaining close ties with the masses, and always putting national interests first, without seeking personal fame or gain. This is an important reason why they could grasp the revolution and production of the entire factory. The fortress is most easily attacked from within. After the revolutionary rebels seize power, there is still the question of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. Only by constantly revolutionizing the "private" thoughts in our minds, constantly opening the door for rectification, and further carrying forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, can we carry the revolution through to the end. If we allow the "private" thoughts in our minds to run wild, and if we detach ourselves from the broad revolutionary masses, we will inevitably be defeated by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie.

Comrades of the revolutionary rebel factions, after seizing power, we must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings on "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and resolutely implement and achieve them. Whether or not we implement the policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" is a touchstone for whether we are truly revolutionary rebels. Shanghai Camera Factory No. 2 is an example of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and it is worth our serious study.

### “抓革命，促生产”的一个范例

    “抓革命，促生产”的一个范例
    ——论夺权以后怎么办？
    上海《文汇报》二月十三日社论
    当前，上海地区无产阶级革命派的全面夺权，出现了一片大好形势。在这种新形势下，革命造反派如何掌好权、用好权，如何夺取革命和生产双胜利，成了一个急待解决的问题。上海照相机二厂的经验，给全市革命造反派提供了一个范例。
    上海工人阶级，一旦从走资本主义道路的当权派手中，夺取了一切权力以后，蕴藏在群众中无可估量的社会主义的积极性，就象火山那样迸发出来，迅速改变了生产的面貌。上海照相机二厂的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，曾经把这个厂的生产糟踏到难以想象的地步。一月份十四天中，完成的生产任务，仅仅只有全月计划的百分之九点二。然而，一旦革命造反派掌了权，情况就大变。十六天中，完成了全月计划百分之九十点八。其中仅五天的时间就完成了全月计划的百分之五十。这个数字，显示了上海工人阶级的冲天干劲。它也预示着，在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，我国的社会主义建设，即将出现一个异乎寻常的高速度。
    上海照相机二厂的经验告诉我们，夺了权以后，还要继续抓革命，一刻也不放松对资产阶级反动路线的批判，揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的滔天罪行。紧紧抓好革命，就能使群众在斗争中自己教育自己，使革命造反精神越来越多地为广大群众所掌握，把对资产阶级反动路线的强烈仇恨，变成促进生产的强大动力。
    夺了权以后，必须紧紧贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，狠狠地把生产抓起来。这符合广大革命群众要求，也体现了群众利益。贯彻了“抓革命，促生产”的方针，努力把生产搞好，是巩固政权的一方面的重要工作，是促使我们立于不败之地的重要保证。切切不可等闲视之。上海照相机二厂的革命造反派发动群众，努力把生产抓了上去，赢得了广大革命职工的信任，逐步巩固了政权。
    毛主席说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”事实正是这样，工人阶级用响当当的成绩，打了资产阶级老爷们一记响亮的耳光。资产阶级老爷们除了干反动的勾当外，什么也不会，布不会织一寸，车不会开一程。踢开了他们，我们的日子才好过哩！
    上海照相机二厂的革命造反派，在夺了权以后，还敢于破除束缚生产力发展的陈规旧章。这种革命精神好得很！我们是彻底革命者，夺权以后不图现成，不搞和平过渡。一切旧的组织机构、旧的工作制度，一切阻碍社会生产力发展的东西，我们统统都要打个粉碎。破字当头，立在其中。敢于彻底破坏旧制度，才能真正建立新秩序。这个厂正是由于改变了生产关系，使生产关系适应了生产力的发展，生产的面貌就迅速起了巨大的变化。
    革命造反派夺权以后，有千件事、万件事要做，但是最根本的一件大事是学好毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装革命造反派的头脑。上海照相机二厂的工人革命造反派，始终注意不让自己沾染官气，和群众继续保持着血肉联系，而且处处以国家利益为重，不计个人名利、地位。这是他们所以能抓好全厂的革命和生产的一个重要原因。堡垒最容易从内部攻破。革命造反派夺权以后，仍然有一个走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题。只有不断革自己头脑里“私”字的命，不断开门整风，进一步发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，才能将革命进行到底。如果听任头脑里的“私”字作怪，如果脱离了广大革命群众，那就必然会被资产阶级糖衣炮弹所打倒。
    革命造反派的战友们，在掌权后，我们一定要念念不忘毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，坚决执行，坚决做到。执行不执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，是检验是不是真正革命造反派的试金石。上海照相机二厂就是“抓革命，促生产”的一个范例，值得我们好好学习。
