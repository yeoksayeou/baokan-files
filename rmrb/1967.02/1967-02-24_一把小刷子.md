Early this morning, Old Wang hurried to the factory. The thrilling news and the call from the great leader had made him so excited that he couldn't sleep. After hearing Chairman Mao's call to "save every penny for the revolution" on the radio, he couldn't help but solemnly swear in front of the great leader's portrait: "Chairman Mao! You support us, and we will surely make you proud. Rest assured, Chairman, we revolutionaries will listen to your words and carry out your instructions to the letter." To quickly spread this great battle call to everyone, he thought he would write a big-character poster in response to this great call as soon as possible today.

As he walked, he thought about how to write it. Just as he was about to reach the factory, he remembered that the brush pen for writing big-character posters was already worn out and unusable. At that moment, he recalled the scene from last night when he and Xiao Liu were writing a big-character poster together: he saw Xiao Liu muttering as he wrote, "We've taken over the power, but still so stingy, this pen should have been replaced long ago." Old Wang patted the young man's shoulder and said sternly, "Xiao Liu, now that we have power, we must cherish state property even more, and always listen to Chairman Mao's words: 'Save every penny for the war and the revolutionary cause.' Let's not replace the pen if we can still use it." Xiao Liu picked up the worn-out pen and said, "Old Wang, but look, this pen is almost a stick!"

Old Wang was still thinking about last night's incident when he suddenly found himself next to a pile of scrap materials. He seemed to have discovered a treasure, reaching out to pull a small, used oil brush head from the scrap pile. He happily talked to the brush head, "I say, little brush, who threw you away? The revolution still needs you!" After getting this "treasure," he quickly headed towards the car shed.

Upon arriving at the shed, Old Wang immediately attached a wooden handle to the small brush head, and soon a usable small brush pen was made. Just then, Xiao Liu also arrived. Old Wang excitedly called out, "Great! You came just in time. Did you hear the broadcast? Chairman Mao has given us the great call to 'save every penny for the revolution.'"

The young man eagerly replied, "I heard it! I came to find you for this very reason. Let's write a big-character poster to firmly carry out this call." "Right, right!" Old Wang took out the small brush pen and said to Xiao Liu, "Let's use it to write a big-character poster advocating for a fierce revolution, a great increase in production, and saving every penny for the revolution." Xiao Liu looked at the small brush for a while and excitedly said, "Old Wang, this time we are immediately responding to Chairman Mao's great call to 'save every penny for the revolution' with actual actions."

Old Wang looked at Xiao Liu with joy and handed him the small brush, saying meaningfully, "Use it to write out our determination as revolutionaries to listen to Chairman Mao's words."

    一把小刷子
    洪宣
    今天一大早，老王就急急忙忙赶到工厂。激动人心的消息，伟大领袖的号召，使他兴奋得睡不着觉。他从收音机里听到毛主席号召“要节约闹革命”的消息以后，情不自禁地在伟大的领袖毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“毛主席呵！您给我们撑腰，我们一定给您争气，您老人家放心吧！我们革命造反者最听您的话，最坚决地照您的指示办事。”为了把这个伟大的战斗号召尽快地告诉大家，他想今天一早就写一张坚决响应这个伟大号召的大字报。
    他一边走，一边想着该怎样写。快到厂时，才想到写大字报的小刷子笔已经秃得不能用了。这时他又想起昨晚和小刘一起写大字报的情景：看他一边写一边嘟囔：“权都夺过来啦，还那么小气，这笔早就该换了。”老王拍拍青年人的肩膀，严肃地说：“小刘，咱们掌了权，可要更爱惜国家财产，要永远听毛主席的话：‘节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业’，这笔能不换就不换吧。”小刘拿起那支秃笔说：“老王，可你也不看看，这笔秃得都快成棍子了！”……
    老王正想着昨晚那段事，不觉走到了一个废料堆旁边，他忽然象发现什么宝贝似的，伸手就从废料堆里拔出一把车间用旧了的小油刷子头。他高兴地对着刷子头说起话来：“我说小刷子，是谁把你给扔了，革命还需要你呢！”他得了这个“宝贝”后，就蹬蹬蹬地直向汽车库走去。
    到了库里，老王马上动手在小刷子头上安了个木柄，很快一把能用的小刷子笔诞生了。正在这时，小刘也来了。老王高兴地喊：“好哇，你来得正好，听到广播了吗？毛主席向咱们提出了‘要节约闹革命’的伟大号召。”小伙子忙说：“听到啦，我就是为这事来找你的，咱们写一张坚决照办的大字报吧。”“对，对！”老王拿出那把小刷子笔来对小刘说：“就用它写一张狠抓革命，大促生产，要节约闹革命的倡议大字报吧。”小刘对着这把小刷子看了一会儿激动地说：“老王，这回咱们是马上用实际行动响应毛主席‘要节约闹革命’的伟大号召了。”老王高兴地看着小刘，把小刷子交给他，意味深长地说：“就用它写出咱们革命造反者最听毛主席话的决心吧。”
