Wearing a Chairman Mao badge is the greatest honor. Burmese friends have boundless love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world. Chairman Mao's invincible great thought illuminates the path forward for the revolutionary people of the whole world. Many Burmese friends, filled with deep feelings of reverence and love for Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao and eagerly hope to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. They regard the Chairman Mao badge as the most precious gift given to them by Chinese friends. They feel boundless pride and honor wearing the Chairman Mao badge.

Long live Chairman Mao!

A group of workers wrote in a letter to their Chinese friends that they cannot express how much they admire and love the great leader of the world proletariat in contemporary times, Chairman Mao. They long to see Chairman Mao and shake hands with him, saying, "Chairman Mao, may you live ten thousand years!" They requested that their Chinese friends send them a few Chairman Mao badges. After receiving the Chairman Mao badges, these workers jointly wrote a letter to their Chinese friends, expressing their thanks for the "most precious gift." They said: "Each of us now wears a golden Chairman Mao badge on our chests... This is our greatest pride and honor! We promise to forever advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!"

We respect and love Chairman Mao.

On the construction sites aided by China, many Burmese laborers from rural areas, with the same feelings of respect and love for Chairman Mao, also requested Chairman Mao badges from Chinese experts. Many of them wear Chairman Mao badges on their chests every day while working with Chinese experts. Some enthusiastically told the Chinese experts, "Mao Zedong, great, great!" "He is the most brilliant leader, the best comrade, and the best friend of the laboring people! We respect and love Chairman Mao!"

The reddest red sun.

Not long ago, at a reception, we met some Burmese youth. They wore shining Chairman Mao badges on their chests, and some even carried the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." These youths surrounded the Chinese friends, enthusiastically praising our great leader Chairman Mao. They said, Chairman Mao is the "reddest red sun in the hearts of the world's youth," Chairman Mao's brilliant works are the "most precious theories in the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism theory," and are the "most powerful fighting weapons of the revolutionary people of the whole world." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the "guiding light, the eternal red sun that never sets." They pointed to the Chairman Mao badges on their chests and said, "Mao Zedong is always with us," and then raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said, "We will always follow Chairman Mao's words!"

A common Burmese woman wrote in a letter requesting a Chairman Mao badge: Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of workers, peasants, students, and all oppressed people around the world. "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, will surely achieve final victory. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high over the entire globe where all humanity lives."

An educator also wrote to his Chinese friend, hoping to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. He wrote in the letter: "The great People's Republic of China, like a brilliant torch of revolution, illuminates the path of the world proletarian revolution. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world proletariat in contemporary times. I respect, admire, trust, and love Chairman Mao."

    祝毛主席万寿无疆
    一批工人在写给中国朋友的信里说，他们无法形容他们是多么敬佩和热爱当代世界无产阶级的伟大领袖毛主席，他们多么希望见到毛主席，同毛主席握一握手，说一声“毛主席，祝您万寿无疆！”他们要求他们的中国朋友送给他们几枚毛主席像章。这些工人在得到毛主席像章后，联名写信给中国朋友，感谢中国朋友送给他们的“最最珍贵的礼物”。他们说：“我们每个人胸前都戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章了……这是我们最大的骄傲和光荣！我们保证永远沿着毛主席指引的方向前进！”
    我们尊敬和热爱毛主席
    在中国援助进行建设的建筑工地上，许多来自农村的缅甸劳动人民，同样怀着尊敬和热爱毛主席的感情，向中国专家索取毛主席像章。他们之中许多人每天都在胸前戴着毛主席像章同中国专家一起工作。有些人竖起大拇指兴奋地对中国专家说：“毛泽东，好，好！”“他是劳动人民最英明的领袖，最好的同志和最好的朋友！我们尊敬和热爱毛主席！”
    最红最红的红太阳
    不久前，在一次招待会上，我们会见了一些缅甸青年，他们的胸前戴着闪闪发光的毛主席像章，他们中有些人还带着《毛主席语录》。这些青年把中国朋友包围起来，热情地颂扬我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他们说，毛主席是“世界青年心中最红最红的红太阳”，毛主席的光辉著作是“马克思列宁主义理论宝库中最宝贵的理论”，是“全世界革命人民最强有力的战斗武器”，战无不胜的毛泽东思想“是指路明灯，是永远不落的红太阳”。他们指着他们胸前的毛主席像章说：“毛泽东永远同我们在一起”，他们又举着《毛主席语录》说：“我们要永远听毛主席的话！”
    一个普通缅甸妇女在请求送给她一枚毛主席像章的来信中写道：毛主席是全世界工人、农民、学生和一切被压迫人民心中的红太阳。“由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命一定会取得最后胜利。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗一定会在我们全人类生活的地球上高高飘扬。”
    一个教育工作者也给他的中国朋友写信，希望得到一枚毛主席像章，他在信中说：“伟大的中华人民共和国，象光辉的革命火炬，照亮了全世界无产阶级革命的道路。”“毛主席是当代世界无产阶级的伟大领袖。我尊敬、钦佩、信赖和热爱毛主席。”
