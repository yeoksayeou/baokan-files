The revolutionary rebels of Yanqiao Commune in Chuan Sha County, Shanghai, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At the same time, they have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production," opening up a new situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieving new successes in production.

When a section of revolutionary peasants and children of poor and lower-middle peasants in this commune first organized to rebel, they were suppressed by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These elements said things like, "The Cultural Revolution in the countryside must be approved by higher authorities," "The Cultural Revolution will affect production, and it is not suitable for the countryside," "Members participating in the rebellion will not be credited with work points," and so on. They did not recognize the revolutionary nature of the peasants' organizations and did not provide conveniences for them to carry out their work, thereby suppressing the revolution. The revolutionary rebels and Red Guards promptly exposed these plots and engaged in a struggle against them. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?' We, the revolutionary rebels of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the Red Guards, must listen to Chairman Mao's words. We must speak, act, make revolution, and rebel. If the Cultural Revolution is not carried out in the countryside, it will change color. Only by carrying out the Cultural Revolution can we ensure that Mao Zedong Thought is passed down for generations to come and that the proletarian state will never change color. We want revolution, and not being credited with work points will not frighten us!" They persisted in their struggle, thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary rebels, rapidly expanding the ranks of the revolutionary leftist forces.

However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were not willing to admit defeat and played new tricks, stirring up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism. They used methods such as increasing the welfare benefits for commune members and adjusting the wages of workers in commune-run factories to deceive the masses. They signed documents and made promises recklessly, distributing tens of thousands of yuan in cash within a few days, attempting to divert a highly serious political struggle onto the path of economism. Just at this time, the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line—An Open Letter to the People of the Whole City of Shanghai" and the editorial notes of the People's Daily, the "Urgent Notice," and the editorial of the People's Daily and Red Flag, "Oppose Economism, Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line," were published one after another. The revolutionary rebels and Red Guards of this commune studied these important documents carefully, receiving great enlightenment and education. They immediately carried out extensive propaganda work, exposing the harmful nature of counter-revolutionary economism, raising the political awareness of the revolutionary masses, and effectively repelling this black wind.

After the counter-revolutionary economism plot was exposed, those bad elements played new tricks, feigning incapacitation and abandoning production leadership, attempting to use "stopping production" to suppress the revolution. The revolutionary rebel fighters of the peasants reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions, closely united with the revolutionary masses, and resolutely struggled against those bad elements. They said: "The world belongs to Mao Zedong Thought, it belongs to the laboring people. Those bourgeois lords who do not work, get out! Let us revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants do it!" They then established a "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production Committee" with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, on the one hand supervising cadres who were not doing a good job in production, making them correct their attitudes, take responsibility, and work seriously to make amends; on the other hand, strengthening production leadership. At present, the revolutionary rebels of the peasants in various brigades and production teams are universally holding poor and lower-middle peasant consultation meetings, doing ideological work, inspiring the enthusiasm of the members to be masters of their own house, mobilizing collective wisdom, studying winter and spring production plans, and doing a good job in agricultural and sideline production. Because winter comes early and lasts long, many vegetable seedlings and young eggplant and melon plants have been frozen to death or have not sprouted. The revolutionary rebels of the peasants immediately mobilized the masses to strengthen field management, fertilize and water the vegetables, and prevent frost and drought. They also universally adopted nylon film to cultivate vegetable seedlings and eggplant and melon seedlings in warm beds to overcome the difficulty of insufficient seedlings and young plants. The revolutionary rebels of the peasants and the poor and lower-middle peasants also braved the cold wind to harvest vegetables in time, supplying the urban consumers with a steady stream of vegetables. The revolutionary peasants who raise pigs and cattle actively did a good job in keeping them warm and feeding them, and the draft cattle and pigs were all well-fed.

The revolutionary rebels of this commune deeply felt from the struggle that to achieve double victories in revolution and production, one must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implement the great alliance of revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, and fight down, fight over, and fight to disgrace the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. They must always and in all things use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. Now, they insist on studying Chairman Mao's works every morning before the ice thaws and every evening before meetings. They remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu," analyze the current situation: Under the impact of the revolutionary torrent, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, although retreating step by step, may still resort to desperate measures for a last struggle. The revolutionary rebels firmly declare: They will definitely heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, expose these elements' plots and tricks in a timely manner, smash their challenges, and better implement Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    严桥公社革命造反派横扫经济主义黑风
    紧密团结革命农民抓好冬春生产
    建立以贫下中农为骨干的抓革命促生产委员会，加强生产领导和生产监督
    坚持学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导一切行动，夺取革命生产双胜利
    据上海《文汇报》报道：上海市郊川沙县严桥公社农民革命造反派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，同时坚决贯彻毛主席提出来的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，打开了无产阶级文化大革命的新局面，生产上也取得了新成绩。
    这个公社一部分革命农民和贫下中农子女刚组织起来造反的时候，就遭到了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的压制。这些家伙说什么“农村文化大革命要经过上级批准”，“文化大革命会影响生产，农村不适宜搞文化大革命”，“社员参加造反不能记工分”等等，不承认革命农民的组织是革命的组织，不给予开展工作的方便，以此来压革命。农民革命造反派和红卫兵小将及时揭穿了这些阴谋，进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”我们贫下中农造反派和红卫兵，就是要听毛主席的话，就是要说、要干、要革命、要造反。农村不搞文化大革命就会变颜色。只有搞好文化大革命，才能保证把毛泽东思想千秋万代地传下去，保证无产阶级江山永不变色。我们要革命，不记工分吓不倒我们！他们坚持斗争，大灭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风，大长了革命造反派的志气，迅速壮大了革命左派队伍。
    但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派并不甘心失败，又玩弄了新花招，刮起反革命经济主义妖风。他们用给社员“增加”福利待遇和给社办工厂工人“调整”工资等手段来迷惑群众。他们乱签字，乱许愿，几天中就发放了上万元钞票，想把一场极其严重的政治斗争引向经济主义的歧途。正在这个时候，《抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑——告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》编者按、《紧急通告》、《人民日报》《红旗》社论《反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑》等文件在报上陆续发表了。这个公社的农民革命造反派和红卫兵小将认真学习这些重要文件，受到了很大的启发和教育。他们立即广泛进行宣传工作，揭露反革命经济主义的危害性，提高了革命群众的思想认识，有力地击退了这股黑风。
    反革命经济主义阴谋被识破后，那些坏家伙又玩弄躺倒不干、放弃生产领导的新花招，企图以“停生产”来压革命。农民革命造反派战士重温了毛主席有关指示，紧密团结革命群众，坚决向那些坏家伙进行了斗争。他们说：“天下是毛泽东思想的天下，是我们劳动人民的天下。那些资产阶级老爷们不干，给我们滚蛋！让我们革命造反派和广大贫下中农来干！”于是，他们成立了以贫下中农为骨干的“抓革命促生产委员会”，一方面监督抓生产不得力的干部，要他们端正态度，负起责任，认认真真地工作，将功补过；一方面加强生产领导。目前，各大队、生产队农民革命造反派普遍召开贫下中农座谈会，做思想工作，启发社员发扬当家作主的精神，发挥集体智慧，研究冬春生产计划，搞好农副业生产。由于冬天冷得早、冷得长，蔬菜菜秧和茄果类幼苗冻死的冻死，不出的不出。农民革命造反派立即发动群众加强田间管理，给蔬菜施肥灌水，抗旱防冻。他们还普遍采用尼龙薄膜培育菜秧和茄果类温床预备苗，克服菜秧和茄果苗不足的困难。农民革命造反派和贫下中农，还迎着寒风及时收割蔬菜，源源不断地供应市区消费者需要。饲养猪牛的革命农民，积极做好保暖和喂料工作，耕牛、生猪都喂养得很好。
    这个公社的革命造反派从斗争中深深地体会到，要取得革命生产双胜利，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，实行无产阶级革命造反派大联合，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，时时刻刻、事事处处用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动。现在，他们每天早上冰冻开封之前，晚上开会之前，都坚持学习毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。他们牢记毛主席的“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，分析了当前的形势：在革命的洪流冲击下，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，虽然节节败退，但是还可能狗急跳墙，进行垂死的反扑。革命造反派坚定地表示：一定百倍地提高革命警惕，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，及时戳穿这些家伙的阴谋诡计，粉碎他们的挑战，更好地执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
