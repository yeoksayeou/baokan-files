In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary peasants of Shanghai's suburbs, with the strongest class feelings, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and doing a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the revolutionary peasants of Lujia Production Brigade, Malu People's Commune, Jiading County, studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Revolutionary students from Shanghai are organized and planned to participate in the revolutionary peasant movement, determined to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end with the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the revolutionary youngsters of the Dongfanghong Brigade of Tongji University discussing with the revolutionary rebels of Haimen Production Brigade, Shengang People's Commune, how to carry out the Cultural Revolution well.

Members of Lujia Production Brigade, Malu People's Commune, Jiading County, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely smashing counter-revolutionary economism. During the year-end distribution, they retained enough public accumulation and production funds. The members immediately deposited the cash they received into the bank to support national construction.

More than three million peasants in Shanghai's suburbs have risen up to make revolution. Various revolutionary rebel organizations have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, with revolutionary rebel organization flags flying in every commune and brigade. They follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "Rebellion is justified" and are determined to smash the old world and create a new world of Mao Zedong Thought.

Members of Hongqiao People's Commune in Shanghai's suburbs read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote production, striking back against the black wind of economism, and ensuring the normal supply of vegetables to Shanghai.

Revolutionary rebel peasants of Lingqiao People's Commune, Chuansha County, high up the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fight against counter-revolutionary economism, and are determined to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Revolutionary peasants in Shanghai's suburbs are implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" without any deviation. While deeply carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have launched a winter production campaign. This is the revolutionary masses of Zhangqiao People's Commune, Chuansha County, digging soil and building dikes to transform low-lying fields, full of vigor and enthusiasm.
