I Want to Be Chairman Mao's Good Student

A female teacher from Ceylon is diligently studying Chairman Mao's works. She often uses a passage from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to inspire herself to study: "The situation is constantly changing, and to make one's thinking adapt to new situations, one must study."

She said passionately, "The 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is my guide to action." She carries the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with her and often uses the time waiting for the bus to study this precious book. Her husband is also very enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao's works. He said that the vivid examples of the Chinese people using Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves and overcome selfishness and promote the public good have deeply moved him. When talking about Chairman Mao's teachings on serving and fighting for the people of the world, he said, "This is the sublime thought of Marxism-Leninism. I want to be Chairman Mao's good student."

This female teacher and her husband also copy passages from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and paste them on the walls of their home, encouraging their children to study them diligently.

    我要做毛主席的好学生
    一位锡兰女教师努力学习毛主席著作。她经常用《毛主席语录》里的一段话激励自己去学习：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”
    她满怀激情地说，《毛主席语录》是我的行动指南。她随身携带《毛主席语录》，经常利用等公共汽车的时间学习这本宝书。她的丈夫学习毛主席著作也很积极。他说，中国人民用毛泽东思想改造自己、破私立公的生动事例，使他感受极深。他在谈到毛主席关于为全世界人民服务和斗争的教导时说：“这是马克思列宁主义的崇高思想。我愿意作毛主席的好学生”。
    这位女教师和她的丈夫还抄录《毛主席语录》里的话贴在家里的墙壁上，要他们的孩子用心学习。
