The Soviet revisionist leading clique on the 9th again directed several hundred people of unknown origin to disrupt our embassy in the Soviet Union.

A small group of thugs in front of our embassy shouted hysterically, loudly chanting anti-China slogans, and viciously insulting our greatest leader, Chairman Mao.

Starting from 2 PM, these thugs surrounded our embassy for nearly three hours. The Soviet police, who were supposedly "guarding the embassy," allowed several groups of so-called "worker representatives" into our embassy's front courtyard. These so-called "worker representatives" banged on the glass of the side door of our embassy's office building and pasted anti-China materials on the door.

This is the fourth day that the Soviet revisionist authorities have organized thugs to perform anti-China farces in front of our embassy. Soviet citizens passing by our embassy were very disgusted with the Soviet revisionist authorities' anti-China schemes and looked on with anger.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Moscow on the 9th, the Soviet revisionist authorities on the afternoon of the 8th from 2:30 to 5 PM, again directed a group of thugs disguised as "worker representatives" to disrupt our embassy in the Soviet Union.

These thugs on the street in front of our embassy shouted anti-China slogans and viciously insulted our greatest leader, Chairman Mao. Two large cars, each equipped with three or four loudspeakers, were parked on the street. Several so-called "factory representatives" repeatedly shouted the anti-China resolutions of their anti-China rally. A major general and two colonels walked back and forth in front of our embassy. At the same time, groups of three to five thugs shouted that they wanted to hand over so-called "protest letters."

On the morning of the 8th, our embassy colleagues, with great indignation, removed the anti-China placards that the thugs had inserted into the fence of our embassy's front courtyard the previous afternoon and smashed them to pieces.

Our embassy in the Soviet Union has lodged a strong protest with the Far East Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this provocative incident.

The Soviet revisionist authorities' anti-China criminal activities in recent days have aroused the indignation of the Soviet people. A middle-aged Soviet woman, seeing three anti-China slogans written by thugs directed by the Soviet revisionist authorities in the snow in front of our embassy, despite the presence of Soviet police, bravely risked great danger to erase the anti-China slogans with her hands and sleeves.

    苏修策动暴徒一再到我使馆捣乱
    新华社莫斯科九日电  苏联修正主义领导集团九日又指使数百名不明来路的人到我国驻苏联大使馆捣乱。
    其中一小撮暴徒在我使馆门前，歇斯底里地大吵大嚷，大肆呼喊反华口号，并恶毒辱骂我们最伟大的领袖毛主席。
    从下午二点起，这些暴徒在使馆门前一直围了将近三个小时。“守卫使馆”的苏联警察还把几批所谓“工人代表”放进我使馆前院。这些所谓“工人代表”在我使馆办公楼侧门猛力敲打玻璃，在门上张贴反华材料。
    这已是苏修当局组织暴徒到我使馆表演反华丑剧的第四天了。路过我使馆周围的苏联群众对苏修当局这种反华勾当十分反感，怒目而视。
    据新华社莫斯科九日电　苏修当局八日下午二时半到五时，又指使一批伪装“工人代表”的暴徒到我驻苏联大使馆捣乱。
    这些暴徒在我使馆前的大街上，大肆叫嚷反华，并恶毒辱骂我们最伟大的领袖毛主席。大街上停着两辆各装着三、四个大喇叭的大轿车，由几个所谓“工厂的代表”，一遍又一遍地重复叫喊他们反华集会的反华决议。有一名少将和两名上校在我使馆前走来走去。与此同时，还有三、五成群的暴徒叫喊着要递交所谓“抗议书”。
    八日晨，我使馆同志怀着极其愤怒的心情，把七日下午暴徒们插在我使馆前院围栏内的反华标语牌拔除，并统统砸得粉碎。
    我驻苏大使馆就这一挑衅事件，向苏联外交部远东司提出了强烈抗议。
    苏修当局连日来所进行的反华罪恶活动，引起了苏联人民的愤慨。一位苏联中年妇女，见到我使馆门前雪地上有苏修当局指使暴徒们写的三条反华标语后，尽管苏联警察在场，她冒着很大风险，用手和衣袖把反华标语擦掉。（附图片）

    无耻的暴徒遵照他们主子的旨意，在我使馆的一些门和玻璃上，贴满了反华传单。
