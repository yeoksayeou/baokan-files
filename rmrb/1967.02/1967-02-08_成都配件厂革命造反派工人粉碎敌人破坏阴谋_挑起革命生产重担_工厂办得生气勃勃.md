Workers of the Chengdu Parts Factory Smash the Enemy's Sabotage Plot, Shouldering the Burden of Revolutionary Production and Making the Factory Thrive

According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 5th: The revolutionary rebel workers of the Chengdu Parts Factory, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, smashed the evil plot of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power who aimed to sabotage production and the Cultural Revolution. They shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, making the factory vibrant and full of life.

At the end of last year, when the revolutionary workers of this factory actively exposed and criticized the capitalist reactionary line, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the factory and those stubbornly implementing the capitalist reactionary line, in order to protect themselves and shift the focus of the struggle, incited some workers who were unaware of the truth to leave their production posts. On December 27th, under the leadership of the factory director and a party branch committee member, one-third of the entire factory suddenly left. They took away production tools, moved the positions of machine tools, and even mixed debris into the lubricating oil, causing the machines to stop, thus carrying out frenzied sabotage of production.

A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists thought that by doing this, they could paralyze production, intimidate the revolutionary rebels; they could sabotage the state's production plan and bring down the factory's vigorous proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary rebels, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely withstood this countercurrent. They said, "The capitalist-roaders in power want to sabotage production, they can't! They left, but we will continue to work, even if the sky falls, we will hold it up." Thus, they elected their own production leadership group, organized the remaining two-thirds of revolutionary workers, and continued to fight on their production posts. They quickly cleared all obstacles and restored normal production.

In the past, under the rule of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power, the factory had many outdated frameworks and foreign dogmas in enterprise management, greatly restricting the workers' production enthusiasm. Now, the revolutionary rebels have smashed these old rules and regulations, allowing everyone's production enthusiasm to be fully unleashed. To overcome the difficulty of insufficient personnel, some people operated two machine tools, while others maintained production during the day and guarded the factory at night.

Before December last year, this factory had not completed the production plan for four consecutive months. After the revolutionary rebel workers took charge, they quickly made up for the production arrears of the past and successfully completed the 1966 annual state plan. Following this, they completed the January production plan in excess of the target despite the heavy tasks and insufficient personnel, thus firing the first shot of 1967.

The revolutionary rebels of the Chengdu Parts Factory, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," have not relaxed their struggle against the capitalist-roaders in power within the party and the capitalist reactionary line. While continuing production, they use their spare time to write big-character posters, hold criticism meetings, and have launched a powerful counterattack against the new counteroffensives of the capitalist reactionary line. On January 25th, various revolutionary rebel organizations further united and formally seized all leadership powers of the factory. Now, they are taking measures according to Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production" to establish a new revolutionary order.

    成都配件厂革命造反派工人粉碎敌人破坏阴谋
    挑起革命生产重担  工厂办得生气勃勃
    据新华社成都五日电 成都配件厂革命造反派工人，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派破坏生产、破坏文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，挑起革命、生产两副担子，把工厂办得生气勃勃。
    去年年底，当这个厂的革命职工积极起来揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，为了保护自己，转移斗争目标，竟在工人中制造分裂，煽动一些不明真相的群众离开生产岗位。十二月二十七日，在厂长和一个党总支委员的带领下，全厂突然走了三分之一的人。他们带走了生产工具，移动了机床位置，甚至在润滑油中掺进渣子，迫使机器不能开动，对生产进行了疯狂的破坏。
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子，以为这样一来，就可以使生产瘫痪下来，把革命造反派吓倒；就可以破坏国家生产计划，把厂里轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派坚决顶住了这股逆流。他们说：“走资本主义道路的当权派要破坏生产，办不到！他们走了，我们照样干，天塌下来也能顶住。”于是，他们选出了自己的生产领导小组，把留下的三分之二的革命职工组织起来，坚守生产岗位，继续战斗。他们迅速扫清了一切障碍，恢复了正常生产。
    过去，这个厂在一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的统治下，在企业管理上沿袭了不少旧框框、洋教条，大大束缚了工人的生产积极性。现在，革命造反派起来砸碎了这些旧的规章制度，使每个人的生产积极性都得到了发挥。为了克服人员不足的困难，有的人一人看了两台机床，有的人白天坚持生产，晚上还要保卫工厂。
    去年十二月份以前，这个厂连续四个月都未完成生产计划，革命造反派工人自己当家以后，迅速补上了过去拉下的生产上的欠帐，胜利完成了一九六六年全年国家计划。接着，他们又在任务重、人员少等不利条件下，超额完成了一月份生产计划，打响一九六七年的第一炮。
    成都配件厂革命造反派遵照毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的教导，丝毫没有放松对党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的斗争。他们一边坚持生产，一边利用业余时间写大字报，开批判会，对资产阶级反动路线的新反扑进行了有力的回击。一月二十五日，各个革命造反派组织又进一步联合起来，正式夺取了工厂的一切领导权力。现在，他们根据毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，正在采取措施，建立革命的新秩序。
