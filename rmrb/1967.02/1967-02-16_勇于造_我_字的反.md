To rebel for the sake of "I" is a false rebellion; to revolutionize for the sake of "the public" is a true revolution. The transformation of one's thoughts cannot be a mere superficial change; it must be a thorough, root-and-branch transformation. Only in this way can one truly internalize Mao Zedong Thought and make it one's soul.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally, is a great revolution to break down the private and establish the public, to transform one's soul, to smash bourgeois ideology, and to promote Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, we revolutionary rebels hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, daring to rebel and daring to revolutionize, advancing bravely and unyieldingly. In the days of white terror, revolutionary rebels, relying on the Four Volumes, stood firm against the fierce winds and waves, repelling the repeated frenzied counterattacks of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They truly deserve to be called the hard bones of the revolution. However, as the movement deepens and broadens, and class struggle becomes increasingly sharp and complex, some people fail to see the situation clearly, are content with the status quo, look left and right, hesitate, and fear losing their "honor." Some people become arrogant, regarding themselves as heroes. Under the onslaught of various sugar-coated bullets, some people have disarmed themselves ideologically, thinking that "the rebellion has gone far enough" and that they can "sleep peacefully now." Others have developed serious liberalism, disregarding the overall situation, not understanding the whole, with no revolution or people in their minds. In a word, the "I" has emerged, and they no longer want to rebel! These people only remember to rebel against others and to overthrow others, but they are unwilling to rebel against the "I" in their minds and to overthrow the "private" in their heads.

To rebel for the sake of "the public" means to rebel more daringly; to revolutionize for the sake of "the private" means to revolutionize less energetically. Whether to revolutionize for the private or for the public is a fundamental contradiction between the bourgeois and proletarian worldviews.

Starting from the "I," everything is considered from the perspective of "I," striving for fame, profit, position, and to stand out, casting aside the Party and the people, forgetting all about the future of the motherland, the ideals of humanity, and the interests of the revolution. Such people, how can they dare to rebel?

Starting from the "public," with no personal gain in mind, dedicating oneself entirely to the revolution, exhausting one's efforts for the people. What personal fame or profit? All of it, away with it! We love, believe in, and worship Mao Zedong Thought without limit. As long as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will fearlessly face any danger, even if it means climbing mountains of knives or crossing seas of fire!

To rebel for the sake of "I" is a false rebellion; to revolutionize for the sake of "the public" is a true revolution. In this sharp and complex class struggle, every comrade must, while transforming the objective world, also transform the subjective world. Only when one's thoughts are revolutionized can one have boundless revolutionary enthusiasm.

The transformation of the soul is a struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews, a great ideological revolution. In the great furnace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must forge our souls, staging a great upheaval in the depths of our souls, rebelling against the "private" and overthrowing the "I" in our minds, fiercely attacking all kinds of selfish thoughts, and truly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism for transforming people's souls, the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for breaking down the private and establishing the public, and for breaking down the old and establishing the new. We must respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao: Study the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles.

To transform the soul, one must have the spirit of "seizing the day." With a high degree of revolutionary consciousness and deep proletarian revolutionary feelings, one must study Chairman Mao's works diligently and earnestly, applying what one learns, studying and applying in the struggle, and focusing on the "application."

To transform the soul, one must have the courage to "seek hardship." In one's thoughts, one must be "at odds with oneself," using the standards of "completely" and "thoroughly" to measure everything, and using the microscope of "seeking no personal gain" to examine oneself, seeing if there is any selfishness. Where there is difficulty, go there, considering it the greatest happiness to endure hardship for the people and the revolution.

To transform the soul, one must have the spirit of "blood and iron." Fearlessly exposing and fighting against the ugly and dirty things in one's mind, the transformation of thoughts cannot be a mere superficial change; it must be a thorough, root-and-branch transformation. One must not avoid the crucial points or merely give a superficial appearance of struggle; instead, one must aim at the vital points and attack fiercely.

To transform the soul, one must have the determination to "eradicate the roots." Regardless of the size of the matter, as long as the "I" appears, one must fight it fiercely, all the time, in everything, and everywhere, fighting for a lifetime, allowing no pretense.

Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress. Only by overthrowing the "I" can we revolutionary rebels truly internalize Chairman Mao's instructions, making them part of our blood and actions, and truly transforming Mao Zedong Thought into our souls. Only then can we truly unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unify our thoughts and steps, rebel against imperialism, rebel against revisionism, rebel against the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, and rebel against all private ownership ideas. We will rebel, thoroughly rebel, and rebel until we create a new world, red with Mao Zedong Thought!

    勇于造“我”字的反
    重庆大学造反战斗组
    为“我”造反，是假造反；为“公”革命，是真革命。思想改造，不能“鸭毛淋水，一晃而过”，而是由表及里，挖树刨根。只有这样，才能把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂。
    无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上来说，就是破私立公的大革命，就是改造灵魂的大革命，就是大破剥削阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的大革命。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下，我们革命造反派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢于革命，敢于造反，勇往直前，百折不挠。在白色恐怖的日子里，革命造反派战士依靠雄文四卷，顶住逆风恶浪，打退了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一次又一次的疯狂反扑，不愧是革命的硬骨头。可是，当运动更深入、更广泛，阶级斗争愈来愈尖锐复杂的时候，有的人就看不清形势，满足现状，左顾右盼，畏缩不前，生怕丢掉了“荣誉”。有的人骄傲自大，以功臣自居。在形形色色的糖衣炮弹的袭击下，有的人解除了思想武装，认为“造反造得差不多了”，“可以睡安稳觉了”。另一些人则滋长了严重的自由主义，不顾大局，不识整体，脑子里没有革命，没有人民。一句话：“我”字出来了，不想再革命了！这些人只记得造别人的反，革别人的命，不愿造“我”字的反，革自己头脑中“私”字的命。
    为“公”造反，越反越敢干；为“私”“革命”，越革越没劲。为私还是为公，是资产阶级和无产阶级两种根本对立的世界观。
    从“我”字出发，一切为“我”着想，争名、争利、争地位、争出风头，把党和人民抛于脑后，祖国的前途，人类的理想，革命的利益，全然忘得一干二净。这样的人，还敢造什么反？
    从“公”字出发，毫不利己，专门利人，鞠躬尽瘁为革命，掏尽红心为人民。什么个人的名呀、利呀，统统滚蛋！我们无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜毛泽东思想，只要毛主席一声令下，我们就是上刀山，下火海，也在所不辞！
    为“我”造反是假造反；为“公”革命，才是真革命。在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们每个同志都必须在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，只有人的思想革命化了，才会有冲天的革命干劲。
    灵魂的改造，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观的搏斗，是一场艰巨的思想革命。在无产阶级文化大革命的大熔炉中，我们就是要熔炼自己的灵魂，在灵魂深处，大闹一场天翻地覆的革命，大造“私”字的反，大革“我”字的命，向形形色色的私心杂念大砍大杀，在头脑中真正树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    毛泽东思想是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是破私立公、破旧立新的最强大、最锐利的思想武器。我们一定要响应林彪副主席的号召：把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学。
    改造灵魂，必须有“只争朝夕”的精神。以高度的革命自觉性，怀着深厚的无产阶级革命感情，如饥似渴地、认真刻苦地学习毛主席著作，学一句，用一句，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    改造灵魂，必须有“自讨苦吃”的勇气。在思想上，就是要“和自己过不去”，不管作什么事都必须用“完全”“彻底”这两把尺子来量一量，用“毫不利己”这个显微镜照一照，看究竟有没有私心。哪里困难哪里去，把为人民为革命而吃苦，当作最大的幸福。
    改造灵魂，必须有“刺刀见红”的精神。不怕丑、不怕痛，抄“我”字的家，把脑子里的脏东西、丑东西都亮出来狠狠地斗。思想改造不能“鸭毛淋水，一晃而过”，而是由表及里，挖树刨根；对“我”字“私”字，不能避重就轻，虚晃一枪，而是要对准要害，猛烈开火。
    改造灵魂，必须有“斩草除根”的决心，事不分大小，只要“我”字一冒头，就狠狠斗、时时斗、事事斗、处处斗，斗一辈子，容不得半点虚假。
    不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。只有把“我”字斗垮，斗倒，斗臭，我们革命造反派才能真正做到把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，才能真正把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，才能真正在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下联合起来，统一思想，统一步调，大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的反，大造一切私有观念的反，大反特反，一反到底，反出一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的红彤彤的新世界！
