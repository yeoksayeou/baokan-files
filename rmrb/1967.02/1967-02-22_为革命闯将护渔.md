On February 5, the weather in Qingdao was clear and sunny.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary fighters of the Red Guards of the Qingdao Marine Fisheries Company, who had won the power struggle, resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." They overcame numerous difficulties to organize the first batch of 14 fishing boats, carrying the trust of their comrades and the revolutionary people of Qingdao, and set sail at dawn.

The sailors and soldiers of a certain naval vessel, who were determined to carry out Chairman Mao's great directive that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left, were ordered to go to sea to perform the task of protecting the fishing boats.

This was an unusual mission, and the sailors and soldiers were particularly excited. Their hearts were closely linked with those of their revolutionary comrades. Political Commissar Ji Zhenqian, together with the sailors, carefully studied Chairman Mao's wise instructions on firmly supporting the revolutionary leftists, and repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force armed with weapons..." The more they studied, the more excited they became, and they spontaneously voiced the same sentiment: "Our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, you understand the revolutionary fervor of the revolutionary fighters! We revolutionary fighters will forever be loyal to you! Your instructions, we will carry out a thousand times, execute a million times." Engine room chief Gao Fengxiu said excitedly, "We protect the revolutionary comrades of the proletariat to ensure safe production, which is a concrete action to firmly support the revolutionary faction. Our hearts are connected with the revolutionary comrades of the proletariat, and we jointly carry out the great directive of the supreme commander, Chairman Mao, to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end." Gao Fengxiu expressed to the party branch that he would definitely put politics in command and ensure the completion of this glorious political task with 100% certainty.

Starting from the second day at sea, they encountered continuous 7-8 level winds, and the temperature suddenly dropped. Waves crashed fiercely against the cruising warship, causing the ship to sway heavily, and many comrades became seasick and vomited. However, the revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with Chairman Mao's great instructions in their hearts, were all spirited. They faced the rolling waves and repeatedly read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations and sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. The strongest voice of "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" drowned out the roar of the sea waves and most powerfully inspired the fighters' fighting will and courage. Signalman Jiang Xueqi, who had only been on the ship for two months, encountered such a big wave for the first time and was more seasick and vomited. He was fearless and read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "Promote the spirit of bravery in battle, fear no sacrifice, fear no fatigue, and continuous battle (i.e., fight several battles in a short period without rest)." His body immediately gained boundless strength. He said proudly, "The waves can only make me vomit, but they cannot shake the revolutionary fighter's limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao and the resolute heart to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought inspired Jiang Xueqi to excellently complete the observation and communication task.

The warship sailed day and night on the fishing protection line, and the sailors and the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat maintained close contact, encouraging and caring for each other. The revolutionary fighters of the proletariat often expressed their thanks and greetings to the sailors through light signals and gestures, and shouted, "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" The sailors also warmly congratulated the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat on their great victories in carrying out Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production." The sailors saw with their own eyes the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat bravely fighting in the waves, pulling net after net of fresh fish onto the deck, and their hearts were filled with the joy of victory. When they heard the exciting news of high production from the fishing boats on the radio, Captain Zhang Jinhua immediately broadcast the good news to every battle position through the loudspeaker. The sailors forgot their fatigue, cheered, and jumped, expressing their determination to learn from the revolutionary spirit and sky-high enthusiasm of the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, to overcome all difficulties, to guard their battle positions, to fight together with the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, and to win together.

Gunner Chi Laiqing had a waist disease, and the icy sea water soaked his clothes, and the biting cold wind made his waist ache. But he remained silent and firmly guarded his position, vigilantly watching the sea and the sky. When he heard the news of the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat overcoming difficulties and achieving high production, he said excitedly, "The Red Rebel fighters resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, make a big fuss about the revolution, and promote production. We must learn their revolutionary spirit and their tenacious fighting will. No matter how big the waves are and how many difficulties there are, our determination to protect the safety of revolutionary comrades' production will not waver. If the enemy dares to cause trouble, we will resolutely sink it to the bottom of the sea!"

On February 14, one fishing boat after another returned to the port loaded with fresh fish. The sailors cheered for the great harvest achieved by the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat in resolutely implementing the policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and felt honored to have contributed their efforts in supporting the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat with actual actions.

    为革命闯将护渔
    二月五日，青岛沿海风和日丽。
    在无产阶级文化大革命频传凯歌声中取得了夺权斗争胜利的青岛海洋渔业公司无产阶级革命派红色战士们，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，冲破重重困难，组织了首批十四对渔轮，带着战友们和青岛革命人民的重托，迎着朝霞出海了。
    坚决执行毛主席发出的人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众伟大指示的海军某舰指战员，为了确保无产阶级革命派战友们海上生产的安全，奉命出海执行护渔任务。
    这是一次不寻常的任务，指战员的心情特别激动。他们的心与无产阶级革命派战友们的心紧紧联系在一起。政委季震乾与水兵们一起再次认真学习了毛主席关于坚决支持革命左派的英明指示，一遍又一遍地重温毛主席的教导：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。……”指战员们越学越激动，不约而同发出同一个声音：最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，您老人家最了解革命战士的满腔革命热情！我们革命战士永远忠于您！您老人家的指示，我们一千个照办，一万个执行。主机班长高丰秀激动地说：“我们保护无产阶级革命派战友安全生产，就是坚决支持革命派的实际行动。我们与无产阶级革命派战友们心连心，共同执行最高统帅毛主席把文化大革命进行到底的伟大指示。”高丰秀向党支部表示，一定要政治挂帅，保证百分之百地完成这个光荣的政治任务。
    从出海第二天起，他们就接连遇上七八级大风，气温骤然下降，排排巨浪猛烈冲击着巡航中的军舰，舰体摇摆得很厉害，不少同志晕船呕吐了。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，胸怀毛主席的伟大指示，个个精神抖擞。他们面对滚滚狂涛，一遍又一遍地高声朗读毛主席语录，高唱毛主席语录歌。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的最强音，盖过了海涛的咆哮，最有力地鼓舞了战士们的战斗意志和勇气。两个月前才上舰的信号兵姜学琪，第一次遇到这样大的风浪，晕船呕吐得更厉害。他毫不畏惧，朗读毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”浑身立即增添了无穷的力量。他豪迈地说：“风浪只能使我呕吐，丝毫不能动摇革命战士无限忠于毛主席，坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命的赤胆红心。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞着姜学琪出色完成了观察通讯任务。
    军舰夜以继日地航行在护渔线上，水兵和无产阶级革命派战友们一直保持着紧密的联系，互相鼓励，互相关怀。无产阶级革命派战友们不时通过灯光信号和手势，向水兵们表示感谢和致意，并高呼：“向人民解放军学习！”水兵们也热烈地祝贺无产阶级革命派战友们坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示所取得的巨大胜利。水兵们亲眼看到无产阶级革命派战友们在狂涛中勇敢奋战，把网网鲜鱼吊上甲板，心里充满了胜利的喜悦。当从收音机里听到渔轮高产的振奋人心消息后，舰长张锦华立即通过扩音器把喜讯传到每个战位，水兵们忘记了疲劳，欢呼跳跃，表示要学习无产阶级革命派的革命精神和冲天干劲，战胜
  一切困难，坚守战斗岗位，与无产阶级革命派战友们战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    炮长迟来庆腰部患病，冰凉冰凉的海水打湿了他的衣服，刺骨的寒风吹得他腰部阵阵疼痛，但他一声不吭地坚守在炮位上，警惕地了望着海面的天空。当他听到无产阶级革命派战友们战胜困难，夺得高产的喜讯后，激动地说：“红色造反派战友们坚决执行毛主席的指示，大闹革命，大促生产，我们要学习他们的革命精神，学习他们的顽强战斗意志。不管风浪多大，困难再多，保卫革命战友生产安全的决心绝不动摇。敌人胆敢捣乱，我们坚决把它打沉海底！”
    二月十四日，一艘艘满载鲜鱼的渔船胜利返港了。水兵们为无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”方针取得的丰收而欢呼，为自己以实际行动支持无产阶级革命派贡献了一分力量而感到光荣。
