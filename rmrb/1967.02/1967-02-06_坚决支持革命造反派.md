	Resolutely Support the Revolutionary Rebels
	[Multi-verse]	Soldier Yong Xiangyang! Seize power! Seize power! Seize power! Rebel! Rebel! Rebel! Seizing power is only natural, rebelling is only right. The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we don't say it, who will? If we don't do it, who will? Look: The Yangtze River south and north, thunder roars; within and beyond the Great Wall, flames rage. Seven hundred million people in China, drums of war resound; across ten thousand miles of sky, horns blare. The revolutionary factions unite, the revolutionary factions seize power. The revolutionary factions seize power, marking a new leap in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary factions seize power, signaling the start of a great class struggle. Revolutionary people applaud, class enemies tremble in fear.

	"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." This is Chairman Mao's warm instruction, and it is our ironclad vow! We resolutely support the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat. We resolutely support the revolutionary factions uniting to seize power. Seize power! Seize power! Seize power! Rebel! Rebel! Rebel! Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. Revolution means seizing power. Without power, there is nothing. Without power, there is no today. In the past, Chairman Mao led us through countless wars and hardships, through thick smoke and gunfire. So many martyrs shed their blood. Why? To seize power! To seize power! After arduous and bloody struggles, paying a heavy price, we seized the red power of the proletariat! But: A small clique within the party, taking the capitalist road, usurped our party power, state power, and economic power. They practiced bourgeois dictatorship, attempting to drag us into the abyss of revisionism. No! No! No! A thousand times no! A million times no! The revolutionary power must not be lost, the wheel of history must not be turned back! At this crucial moment, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, has made a wise decision and issued a great call to us, urging us to firmly stand with the true revolutionaries. We are the people's army created by Chairman Mao. We swear to defend the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. We are the pillars of the proletarian dictatorship, and we will give the revolutionary factions one hundred percent support. In the past, the army braved fire and water, fought to the death, and won the vast land for the people. Today, in this great class struggle, the army will make new contributions to the people. "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," this is an unshakable truth, this is the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship. We must hold tightly to the proletarian gun, resolutely support the revolutionary factions in their struggle to seize power; we must hold tightly to the proletarian gun, and defend to the death the power already seized by the revolutionary factions. Revolutionary comrades! Dare to fight: smash the old world, build a new one. We roar: only the revolutionary factions can seize power, the reactionaries cannot rebel! If those bastards dare to touch a hair on your head, we will smash them to bits! Seize power! Seize power! Seize power! Rebel! Rebel! Rebel! We will fight side by side, we will swing our iron fists, launch a total attack on the small clique within the party that takes the capitalist road, and thoroughly smash their last rotten defense line! We must, build a bright red new world; we must, defend the iron mountains of the proletariat!

  政权！可是：党内一小撮走资本主义道

  人民军队，我们誓死保卫以毛主席为
  代表的无产阶级革命路
  线。我们是无产阶级专政的柱
  石，要给革命派以百分之百的
  支援。过去解放军赴汤蹈火，前
  赴后继，为人民打下了万里江山，今天，在这场阶级大搏斗
  中，解放军要为人民做出更新
  的贡献。“枪杆子里面出政权”，这是颠扑不破的真理，这是无产阶级专政的历史
  经验。我们要握紧无产阶级的枪
  杆子，坚决支援革命派的夺权斗
  争；我们要握紧无产阶级的枪
  杆子，誓死保卫革命派已经夺得
  的一切大权。革命派战友们！你们大胆地干吧：砸烂旧世界，建设新天地。我们大喝一声：只许革命派夺权，不许反动派翻天！那些坏家伙胆敢动你们一
  根毫毛，我们打他个稀巴烂！夺权！夺权！夺权！造反！造反！造反！我们要并肩战斗，我们要同挥铁拳，向党内一小撮走资本主义
  道路的当权派发起总攻
  击，彻底摧毁他们最后一道腐
  朽的防线！我们一定要，打出一个红彤彤的新世
  界；我们一定要，保卫好无产阶级的铁江
  山！
