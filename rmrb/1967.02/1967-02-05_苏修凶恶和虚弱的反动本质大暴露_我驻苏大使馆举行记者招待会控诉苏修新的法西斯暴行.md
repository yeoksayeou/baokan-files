The Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a press conference to denounce the new fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY MOSCOW February 4 – The Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a press conference in the embassy this morning to denounce the fascist barbaric crime committed by the Soviet revisionist authorities, who on the night of February 3 sent plainclothes agents and thugs to break into the embassy's front courtyard fence, smashing and stealing six news photo display cases set up in the embassy's front courtyard, and assaulting Chinese diplomatic personnel, embassy staff, and Chinese journalists.

	Chinese Embassy Press Officer Miao Qun gave a detailed account of the fascist atrocity to the foreign journalists attending the press conference and read out a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy on the matter.

	Miao Qun said in his speech that the Soviet revisionist leadership, with the blood of the Chinese students they brutally suppressed in front of Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square still fresh, dared to extend their blood-stained claws into the Chinese Embassy, once again creating a horrifying bloody incident. Miao Qun said that it is well known that setting up news photo exhibitions on embassy premises is a normal diplomatic activity, and no one has the right to interfere. The Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified and hates the news photo display cases to the core, which precisely exposes their weak reactionary nature. The display cases in our embassy feature photos such as "Mao Zedong Thought – The Fighting Weapon of the World's Revolutionary People," "Chairman Mao's Eight Receptions of the Red Guards," and "The Bloody Incident in Red Square." These photos fully embody the brilliance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and fully reflect the true facts of objective reality.

	Miao Qun said that our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the Soviet revisionist ruling clique fears revolution, truth, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the more determined we are to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The press conference displayed some photos of the Soviet plainclothes agents looting the Chinese Embassy's display cases and Chinese diplomatic personnel, embassy staff, and journalists being injured. It also exhibited the display case supports sawed off by the Soviet plainclothes agents, which were located on the embassy's territory.

    苏修凶恶和虚弱的反动本质大暴露
    我驻苏大使馆举行记者招待会控诉苏修新的法西斯暴行
    新华社莫斯科四日电　中国驻苏联大使馆就三日晚上苏修当局指使便衣特务和暴徒闯入中国大使馆前院围栏内，砸坏和抢走设在使馆前院围栏内的六个新闻图片橱窗，并殴打中国外交官员、使馆工作人员和中国记者这一法西斯的野蛮罪行，四日上午在大使馆内举行了记者招待会。
    中国大使馆新闻专员缪群向参加记者招待会的外国记者们详细介绍了这一法西斯暴行的经过，并宣读了中国大使馆就此事发表的声明。
    缪群在讲话中说，苏修领导集团在红场列宁陵墓前残酷镇压我留欧学生的血迹未干，又公然把它血淋淋的魔爪伸进中国大使馆，又一次制造了骇人听闻的流血事件。缪群说，众所周知，在大使馆领土上设置新闻图片展览，是正常的外交活动之一，任何人不得侵犯。苏修领导集团对我新闻图片橱窗怕得要死，恨得要命，这恰恰暴露了它虚弱的反动本质。我使馆橱窗中，展出了“毛泽东思想——世界革命人民的战斗武器”、“毛主席八次接见红卫兵”、“红场流血事件”等图片。这些图片充分体现了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉，充分反映了客观事物的真相。
    缪群说，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席指出，“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”苏修统治集团越是怕革命，怕真理，怕毛泽东思想，怕中国无产阶级文化大革命，我们就一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    记者招待会展出了苏修便衣特务抢劫中国大使馆橱窗和中国大使馆外交官员、工作人员、中国记者被打伤情况的部分照片。同时还展示了苏修便衣特务锯断的橱窗支柱，这些支柱立在使馆的领土内。
