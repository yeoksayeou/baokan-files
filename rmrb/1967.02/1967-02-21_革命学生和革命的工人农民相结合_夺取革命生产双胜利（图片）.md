Revolutionary students and revolutionary workers and peasants combine to achieve dual victories in revolution and production. Revolutionary intellectual youth respond to Chairman Mao's great call for intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants, and go deep into factories to learn from revolutionary rebel workers, uniting and fighting together with them to resolutely repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The picture shows students who have gone to the factory and Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers writing big-character posters together.

Cadets from a certain academy of the People's Liberation Army, through living and fighting together with revolutionary rebel workers in factories, deeply feel that to understand workers, one must go among the workers, share their fate, and breathe together, only then will there be a common language. The people's soldiers cannot be separated from workers and peasants, and if they do not understand workers and peasants, they will not be able to firmly support the proletarian revolutionary faction. The picture shows the cadets studying Chairman Mao's quotations together with revolutionary rebel workers.

Red Guards go deep into the countryside and, together with poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary rebels, while carrying out the cultural revolution in the countryside, also vigorously prepare for spring plowing. The picture shows the little heroes reading the newspaper in the fields with poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary rebels in Baoshan County, Shanghai. They unanimously declare their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words: "Pay attention to national affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

Revolutionary youngsters, following Chairman Mao's instructions on students to "study as the main task, and also learn other things, that is, not only study literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie," go deep into factories to learn production knowledge from revolutionary rebel workers, and together with them, grasp the revolution and promote production, achieving dual victories in revolution and production.

    人民解放军某学院学员，在和工厂的革命造反派工人共同生活和战斗中，他们深深地感到：要了解工人，就必须到工人当中去，和他们同命运，共呼吸，这样才会有共同的语言。人民战士决不能脱离工农，不了解工农，就不可能做到坚决支持无产阶级革命派。图为学员们和革命造反派工人一起学习毛主席语录。
    红卫兵小将们深入农村和贫下中农革命造反派一起，在搞好农村文化大革命的同时，大搞备耕生产。图为小将们同上海宝山县贫下中农革命造反派一起在田间读报。他们一致表示，决心听毛主席的话：“要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！” 
    革命小将们遵照毛主席关于学生“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的教导，深入工厂向革命造反派工人学习生产知识，并同他们一起，狠抓革命，大促生产，夺取革命生产双胜利。本栏照片均为本报记者摄
