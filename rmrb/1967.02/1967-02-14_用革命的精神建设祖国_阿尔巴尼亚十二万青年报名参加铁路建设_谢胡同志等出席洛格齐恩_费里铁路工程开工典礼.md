Albanian youth and other segments of the people have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, rushing to sign up for voluntary labour to build the major project of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the Logar-Zharrë-Fieri railway. The first batch of 2,400 voluntary labourers arrived at the construction site on February 1 and began work.

The Logar-Zharrë-Fieri railway construction project was formally launched at a grand ceremony held in the morning of February 3 in the city of Lushnje.

Albanian Party and government leaders Shehu, Alia, Marko, Kolega, and Peza attended the ceremony.

Comrade Shehu, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, the Council of Ministers, and the people and the Party of Labour of Albania, extended heartfelt congratulations on the commencement of the railway construction project and wished the young voluntary labourers success in their work!

Last year, the Albanian Youth League at various levels put forward a revolutionary initiative, proposing that the task of building the major project of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the Logar-Zharrë-Fieri railway, be entrusted to the youth of the whole country, to be completed through voluntary labour, and that the original four-year construction period be shortened to two years. The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Council of Ministers enthusiastically supported and approved this initiative.

So far, 120,000 young people from all districts across the country have signed up to participate in the construction of this project. In the past month, the offices of the Central Committee of the Youth League and the District Committees of the Youth League have frequently received many young people asking to participate in the railway construction. Some young people have also written letters or sent telegrams to the Central Committee of the Youth League and newspapers, asking to swing the first pickaxe on the railway construction site.

The 13-year-old daughter of the great communist fighter Adam Reka, a student of Nakos Spiru School in the District of Durres, T. Reka, wrote a letter to the newspaper saying, "I feel happy to be able to participate in the first batch of railway construction. I will work and defend the socialist motherland's property like my father, Adam Reka." The daughter of M. Taraci, who was assassinated by local reactionaries more than ten years ago for actively participating in the construction of a hydroelectric power station, a student of Shej Zeka Normal School in Shkodër, P. Taraci, picked up the pickaxe that her mother had laid down and walked onto the railway construction site. A family of five brothers and sisters held a family meeting and decided to go together to participate in the railway construction.

In addition to the youth, some retired workers, Young Pioneers, and those who had participated in the first railway construction as voluntary labourers have also written letters and sent telegrams to relevant departments, asking to participate in the railway construction. A retired female worker from Durres District, mother of five children, H. Joni, requested to go to work with her five children. An 68-year-old mother of martyrs, H. Baboci, wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Youth League requesting to participate in voluntary labour. She said in her letter: "My children shed their blood for the freedom of the people. I will resolutely follow in their footsteps."

The railway construction project headquarters, in accordance with the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, decided to strengthen revolutionary education and military training for the youth while organizing labour.

    用革命的精神建设祖国
    阿尔巴尼亚十二万青年报名参加铁路建设
    谢胡同志等出席洛格齐恩—费里铁路工程开工典礼
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚青年和其他阶层人民，热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，争先恐后地报名参加义务劳动，建设第四个五年计划的重大建设项目之一洛格齐恩—费里铁路。第一批义务劳动者二千四百人已于二月一日到达工地，开始劳动。
    洛格齐恩—费里铁路工程已于二月三日上午在卢什涅市隆重举行开工典礼。
    阿尔巴尼亚党、政领导人谢胡、阿利雅、马尔科、科列加、佩扎等出席了典礼。
    谢胡同志以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央、部长会议以及阿尔巴尼亚人民和劳动党的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的名义，衷心祝贺铁路工程开工，祝青年义务劳动者工作顺利！
    去年，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟各级组织提出革命倡议，要求把第四个五年计划的重大工程之一洛格齐恩—费里铁路的建设任务交给全国青年，由青年用义务劳动来建成，并把原计划四年建设的时间缩短到两年。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和部长会议热烈支持和批准了这一倡议。
    到目前为止，全国各区已有十二万青年报名，要求参加这一工程的建设。一个月来，在劳动青年联盟中央和劳动青年联盟区委的办公室里都频繁地接待许多要求去参加铁路建设的青年。有些青年还写信或打电报给劳动青年联盟中央和报社，要求在铁路建设工地上抡第一镐。
    伟大的共产主义战士亚当·雷卡的十三岁的女儿、都拉斯区纳科·斯皮鲁学校的学生塔·雷卡写信给报社说，我为能够第一批参加铁路建设而感到幸福。我要象爸爸亚当·雷卡那样工作和保卫社会主义祖国的财产。十几年前因积极参加水电站建设而被当地反动派暗杀的马·塔拉齐的女儿、斯库台市谢·朱卡师范学校的学生帕·塔拉齐重新拿起了母亲放下的镐，走上了铁路建设工地。有一家五个兄弟姊妹同父母亲开了个家庭会议，决定五人一起去参加铁路建设。
    除了青年以外，还有一些退休职工、少先队员和曾经参加过第一次铁路建设的义务劳动者也纷纷写信和打电报给有关部门，要求参加铁路建设。都拉斯区一名退休女工、五个孩子的母亲希·约尼要求同五个孩子们一起去劳动。六十八岁的烈士母亲哈·巴鲍奇写信给劳动青年联盟中央要求参加义务劳动。她在信里说：我的儿女们为了人民的自由流尽了鲜血。我坚决循着他们的道路前进。
    铁路建设工程总指挥部根据霍查同志的教导，在组织劳动的同时，决定加强对青年的革命教育和军事训练。
