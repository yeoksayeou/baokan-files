The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Guiyang, who have achieved victory in seizing power, held a grand pledge rally on the 12th to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new and higher stage. They solemnly pledged to the great leader Chairman Mao: We will, with a sense of urgency, advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new and higher stage. We will build our proletarian revolutionary rebels into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready revolutionary army. We will achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and ensure that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever flies high!

The rally adopted a telegram to Chairman Mao.

That afternoon, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao and plaques with Chairman Mao's quotations, gathered from all directions to the venue in front of the Telecommunications Building. The venue was adorned with red flags, filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" and revolutionary songs created a sea of joy. Many revolutionary fighters, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, exchanged their learning experiences with each other. Everyone agreed that, in the struggle between the two lines, only by striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works can we truly follow Chairman Mao and achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production.

The rally began with everyone reading Chairman Mao's quotations aloud and singing "The East Is Red" together.

Activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, including a military doctor from a certain unit of the Guiyang Military Region, a worker from the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought, and a revolutionary rebel from the Zhaiji Brigade of the Yunling Commune in Yunyan District, Guiyang City, reported on their units' experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and promoting production during the Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, to learn and use them in the struggle, and to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and to make production even better.

Representatives from the Guiyang Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, the Guiyang City Red Guards Headquarters of Mao Zedong Thought, and revolutionary students from outside who came to Guiyang for exchanges all pointed out in their speeches that small-groupism, individualism, factionalism, and ultra-democracy are erroneous thoughts that hinder the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, impede the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and weaken the combat effectiveness of the proletarian revolutionary rebels. The root of these erroneous thoughts lies in the word "self." They said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of great unity and seizure of power. The proletarian revolutionary rebels must seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Old Three Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," and "Against Liberalism." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, they must carry out two revolutions simultaneously: the revolution to change the objective world and the revolution to change the subjective world; seize two powers: seize the power of the capitalist roaders and seize the power of the "self" in one's mind. They must regard themselves as both the motive force and the object of the revolution. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, they must carry out a revolution in their souls, wage a fierce struggle against the "self," drive the "self" out the door, and let the "public" settle down, smash bourgeois ideology, and establish proletarian ideology. In short, they must firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

During the rally, people repeatedly raised their arms and shouted:

"Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

"Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    贵阳地区无产阶级革命造反派举行誓师大会
    把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向更新阶段
    把造反派建设成非常无产阶级化战斗化革命大军
    新华社贵阳电　取得夺权胜利的贵阳地区无产阶级革命造反派，十二日隆重举行把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮的誓师大会，向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：决心以只争朝夕的革命精神，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个更新、更高的阶段，把我们无产阶级革命造反派建设成为一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大军，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的完全胜利，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远高高飘扬！
    大会通过了《向毛主席致敬电》。
    这天下午，无产阶级革命造反派抬着毛主席的巨幅画像和毛主席语录牌，从四面八方汇集到电信综合大楼前的会场。会场上，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声和革命歌声，汇成一片欢腾的海洋。许多革命战士怀着对毛主席著作的深厚的阶级感情，互相交流学习心得。大家认为，当前，在两条路线的斗争中，只有努力活学活用毛主席著作，真正把毛泽东思想学到手，才能紧跟毛主席，夺取文化大革命和生产建设双胜利。
    大会在齐声朗读毛主席语录和齐声高唱《东方红》中开始。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、贵州省军区某部军医，贵阳矿山机器厂毛泽东思想红色工人战斗团战士和贵阳市云岩区黔灵公社宅吉大队革命造反派战士，在大会上介绍了他们所在单位在文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命促生产的情况。他们表示一定要更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，按照毛主席的教导，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把生产搞得好上加好。
    贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部代表、贵阳市大中学校毛泽东思想红卫兵司令部代表以及外地来贵州串连的革命师生代表在发言中一致指出，小团体主义、风头主义、山头主义、极端民主化等错误思想，妨碍无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，妨碍无产阶级文化大革命的深入开展，削弱无产阶级革命造反派的战斗力。这些错误思想的总根源在于一个“私”字。他们说，无产阶级文化大革命进入了大联合大夺权的新阶段，无产阶级革命造反派一定要认真学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《整顿党的作风》、《反对自由主义》等，按照毛主席的教导，同时进行两个革命：改造客观世界的革命和改造主观世界的革命；夺两个权：夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。既把自己当作革命的动力，又把自己当作革命的对象。要通过学习毛主席著作，在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，狠斗“我”字，让“私”字扫地出门，让“公”字安家落户，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，一句话，要大立毛泽东思想。
    在大会进行过程中，人们不断振臂高呼：
    “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    “我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
