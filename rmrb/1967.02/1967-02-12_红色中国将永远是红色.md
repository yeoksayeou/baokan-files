The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest revolution. First, this movement involves seven hundred million Chinese people, which is one-fourth of the world's population. In terms of numbers, it is also the largest revolutionary movement of the contemporary world, unprecedented in history. Second, the theoretical foundation of this revolution is the most advanced of the contemporary world, and its leader is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary world, Chairman Mao. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution provides the most precious wealth for the revolutionary people of the world.

It is clear that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only related to the destiny of the Chinese people but also to the destiny of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world. Because the leading group of the Soviet Union, the first socialist country in the world, has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and the world's revolutionary people, the significance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is even greater. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution also embodies Chairman Mao's responsibility to the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao knows that China must not follow the Soviet Union's path of revisionism but should become a stronghold to consolidate the world revolution. Now, the strongest revolutionary stronghold in the world is the People's Republic of China. What would happen to the world if China went astray? It is precisely because of Chairman Mao's responsibility to the world's revolutionary people that Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao said that at any time, it is reasonable to rebel. This is true even in socialist countries. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the revisionists are terrified to death. Chairman Mao's greatness lies not only in proposing that it is reasonable to rebel but also in supporting and encouraging this spirit of revolutionary rebellion.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has also proven Chairman Mao's assertion: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "The masses are the real heroes."

I am very honored to live in Red China. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Red China will forever be red. China will be more consolidated and more powerful. We are indeed very happy to see that through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is not only spreading in China but also throughout the world, including Indonesia.

For me, this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also a revolution that touches the depths of my soul, making me understand that to become a true revolutionary, one must first revolutionize one's thoughts. One cannot just shout slogans about supporting Mao Zedong Thought and opposing imperialism and revisionism but must put these into actual actions. Indonesian revolutionaries must resolutely grasp Mao Zedong Thought and become true revolutionaries. We not only need to revolutionize others but also ourselves, making our thoughts revolutionary. To truly revolutionize to the end and dedicate one's life to revolution, one must learn and master Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought. We know that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is personally led by Chairman Mao, so we Indonesian people are very concerned about it. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, I gradually understand that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only strengthens the world revolutionary stronghold led by Chairman Mao but also relates to the people struggling for the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." I have read this famous saying of Chairman Mao's teachings long ago, but this time, seeing with my own eyes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, I have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seven hundred million people participate in the great debate and study Mao Zedong Thought, which in itself is of great significance. The "Sixteen Points" have a point that says not to be afraid of "chaos." When I read this point, I repeatedly pondered this sentence. Only after repeatedly reading many articles did I more deeply understand Chairman Mao's great theory of fully trusting the masses. Now I understand that we must rely on the people, be self-reliant, and dare to struggle. We must learn from the masses and be the masses' little students. In the past, I always educated my children, but in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is my children who educate me. Modern revisionists distort and slander, saying that China is inciting young people to criticize "experienced cadres," using this to attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. But as Chairman Mao said, history is advancing, and we must keep learning.

    红色中国将永远是红色
    印度尼西亚  伊萨
    中国文化大革命是最伟大的革命。第一，这个运动有中国七亿人民参加，占世界人口的四分之一。从人数来说，也是当代最大的革命运动，是空前的。第二，这次革命的理论基础是当代最先进的，领导者是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席。这场文化大革命为世界革命人民提供了最宝贵的财富。
    很清楚，文化大革命不仅关系到中国人民的命运，也关系到亚非拉和全世界人民的命运。由于苏联这个世界上第一个社会主义国家的领导集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了世界革命人民，中国的无产阶级文化大革命的意义就更伟大了。文化大革命也体现了毛主席对世界革命人民的责任。毛主席知道，中国不能再蹈苏联的覆辙，而应该成为一个巩固世界革命的堡垒。现在世界上最强大的革命堡垒是中华人民共和国。如果中国走上了歧途，世界上会怎么样呢？正是由于毛主席对世界革命人民的责任，毛主席才亲自发动和领导了这场文化大革命。毛主席说，在任何时候，都是革命造反有理，即使在社会主义国家里也是如此。也许正是因为这一点，修正主义害怕得要死。毛主席的伟大，不仅提出了革命造反有理，而且支持和鼓励这种革命造反精神。
    文化大革命也证明了毛主席的论断：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄”。
    我很荣幸住在红色中国，通过文化大革命，红色中国将永远是红色。中国将更加巩固，更加强大。我们的确非常高兴看到，通过文化大革命，毛泽东思想不仅在中国传播，而且在全世界包括印度尼西亚传播。
    对我来说，这场文化大革命也是触及我灵魂深处的革命，使我懂得，要成为一个真正的革命者，首先要思想革命化。一个人不能光是在口头上喊要拥护毛泽东思想，要反帝反修，而是要表现到实际行动中来。印度尼西亚的革命者一定下决心掌握毛泽东思想，成为真正的革命者。我们不但要革别人的命，还要革自己的命，使自己思想革命化。要真正革命到底，一辈子干革命，必须学习和掌握毛泽东思想。

    中国文化大革命是毛泽东思想的体现。我们知道文化大革命是毛主席亲自领导的，因此我们印尼人民非常关心它。随着中国文化大革命的深入发展，我慢慢了解到文化大革命不仅加强毛主席领导的世界革命堡垒，也关系到为争取无产阶级专政而斗争的人民。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”过去我早就读了毛主席教导的这句名言，这次亲眼看到了中国无产阶级文化大革命，使我对毛主席的这一教导有了更深刻的体会。
    在文化大革命中，七亿人民参加大辩论、学习毛泽东思想，这本身就有非常重大的意义。“十六条”中有一条讲不要怕出“乱子”。当我读到这一条时，我反复考虑这句话。只有经过反复阅读许多文章，才更加理解毛主席关于充分相信群众这一理论的伟大。现在我理解到要依靠人民，自力更生，敢于斗争。我们要向群众学习，做群众的小学生。以前总是我教育孩子，但在这次文化大革命中，却是我的孩子教育我。现代修正主义者歪曲和诬蔑说，中国正在发动年轻人批判“有经验的干部”，以此来攻击文化大革命。但正如毛主席所说，历史在前进，我们要不断学习。
