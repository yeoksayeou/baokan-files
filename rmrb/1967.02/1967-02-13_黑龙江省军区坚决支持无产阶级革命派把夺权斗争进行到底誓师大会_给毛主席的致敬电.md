The Chinese People's Liberation Army Black Dragon River Province Military Region's troops held a grand rally to resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary faction to carry the struggle for power to the end on February 10. The rally sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, the full text of which is as follows:

Most, most, most, most respected great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao:

We, the entire cadre and soldier contingent of the Black Dragon River Province Military Region, salute you—the most red, most red red sun in our hearts—with the highest proletarian cultural revolution combat salute!

We have seen the editorial in the third issue of the "Red Flag" magazine, "On the Struggle for Power by the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction," the editorial in the "Liberation Army News," "The People's Liberation Army Resolutely Supports the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction," and the editorial in the "People's Daily," "A Good Example of the Struggle for Power by the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction," and the basic experience of the power struggle by the Red Rebels of Black Dragon River Province. We have heard your voice again and again, our hearts are extremely moved, and our blood is boiling. Respected Chairman Mao, this is the greatest concern, the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur from you to the red rebels and revolutionary cadres throughout Black Dragon River Province, as well as to us. We will surely remember your teaching, "Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind." We will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Under your thought's radiance, in the proletarian cultural revolution movement personally initiated and led by you, we resolutely stand with the red rebels and the main responsible persons executing your revolutionary line within the Black Dragon River Province Committee. We strive to win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary organizations and elements that are counterattacking the revolutionary line. In the life-and-death struggle, we have forged deep revolutionary friendship with revolutionary cadres and red rebels, implemented joint actions, and seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the hands of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. We have firmly grasped these powers in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. This is a great victory for your revolutionary line! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

Respected Chairman Mao! You are our most, most great commander-in-chief. We are your most loyal revolutionary soldiers. You say how, and we do how; you point to where, and we fight to where. At this critical moment when the red rebels and the broad revolutionary masses throughout the province are launching a comprehensive struggle for power against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, we swear to you: We will better implement your instructions on the People's Liberation Army actively supporting the broad leftist masses, and resolutely support and assist the proletarian revolutionary faction together with the revolutionary masses and cadres throughout the province. We will carry the struggle for power throughout the province to the end. Whenever the genuine proletarian revolutionary faction needs our assistance, we will immediately mobilize and provide full support. We dare to climb the knife mountain; we dare to rush into the sea of fire. We will resolutely overthrow the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and all the tricks of the class enemies; we will resolutely support and obey the correct leadership of the provisional highest authority organ of the province—the Black Dragon River Province Red Rebels Revolutionary Committee, and make greater contributions to building and consolidating the new power. We will carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. We will resolutely suppress those current counter-revolutionaries, counter-revolutionary organizations, and all ghosts and monsters that oppose the proletarian revolutionary left and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. The enemy will not surrender, so we will annihilate it!

Respected Chairman Mao, we will surely remember your teaching: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle." We will heighten our revolutionary vigilance, guard our posts, promote revolution, prepare for war, promote work, and promote production. If the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries dare to provoke us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them!

We resolutely respond to the call of your close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and study the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas in the Party" as our motto. We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will be your good soldiers.

We sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

We cheer a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定牢记您的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”提高革命警惕，坚守岗位，抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产。帝国主义、现代修正主义以及一切反动派胆敢向我们挑衅，就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭！
