Workers of Workshop 201 at Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory No. 2 carry forward revolutionary spirit and fully overfulfill state plan for three consecutive months

According to Xinhua News Agency Shanghai: The revolutionary rebel workers of Workshop 201 at Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory No. 2 have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production." With a fearless revolutionary spirit and boundless enthusiasm for production, they have simultaneously carried out the Cultural Revolution and promoted production, achieving double victories in revolution and production. The revolutionary leftist ranks have greatly expanded, and production has fully overfulfilled the state plan for three consecutive months (last November, December, and this January).

The leftist revolutionaries in this workshop resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, standing at the forefront of both revolutionary struggle and production struggle. They make every effort not to leave production and use their spare time to engage in the movement, thus setting an example for the masses.

Precisely because the revolutionary rebels in this workshop have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production," the entire workshop's Cultural Revolution has been carried out with great fervor, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people. As the movement deepens, production has also improved. Taking last October as the dividing line, the average monthly output for November, December, and this January is 2.43 percent higher than the average for January to October last year. The average monthly output for November, December, and this January is 36.8 percent higher than the average for January to September last year. Quality has also steadily improved. The proportion of high-quality products in November, December, and this January reached 96 percent of the total output, far exceeding the actual level and planned requirements for the same period last year.
