Deputy Director of Workshop Eleven, Li Youzhi of the Harbin Electric Machine Factory, has undergone numerous tests during the Cultural Revolution and has always stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary rebels. He is an ordinary member among millions of revolutionary cadres. From his struggles over the past few months, one can see that many of our cadres are good, daring to revolt and daring to rebel; it also shows how our revolutionary rebels seriously examine cadres and warmly support and protect revolutionary cadres.

Li Youzhi is a young Communist Party member. During the Four Cleanups movement, he underwent the test of class struggle and was promoted from a worker to the deputy director of the workshop. Not long after the Cultural Revolution began, the Red Rebels raised the banner of "Rebellion is Justified" and fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Their daring and fearless revolutionary spirit greatly inspired Li Youzhi, and he wrote the first application to join the Red Rebel Corps.

The Red Rebels, holding Li Youzhi's application, engaged in heated discussions. They believed that since the "Four Cleanups," Li Youzhi had worked diligently and responsibly, was hardworking, and had a decisive style. However, the movement had just begun, and it was not yet possible to fully affirm that he was a genuine revolutionary. Therefore, the Red Rebel Corps decided to continue testing him.

The flames of the mass movement burned more fiercely. Some people threw down their tools and refused to work, seriously threatening production. The Red Rebels stepped forward, taking on the heavy responsibility of production.

At the same time, the Red Rebel Corps found Li Youzhi and urged him to come out and jointly manage production. Li Youzhi said with full confidence: "I am the son of a poor peasant, a cadre educated by Chairman Mao. I must actively participate in the revolution and must do a good job in production."

In Workshop Eleven, the Assembly Group and the Electric Welding Group are key to production and directly affect the completion of the entire factory's tasks. He personally took charge of these two groups. Chairman Mao said: "The masses harbor a tremendous socialist enthusiasm." Li Youzhi firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, believing that the masses are the true heroes. As long as we rely on the masses, we will be invincible. He united with the Red Rebels and other veteran workers, working tirelessly. The Electric Welding Group had few people and diverse tasks, so he personally picked up the tools and worked.

Under Li Youzhi's leadership, through the arduous efforts of the Red Rebels, they completed the entire year's production tasks one quarter ahead of schedule. The Red Rebels were all jubilant.

In terms of production management, Li Youzhi passed the test. However, a cadre should be identified and tested more in the storms of class struggle.

The exposure and criticism meeting of Workshop Eleven began. A surge of hatred against the capitalist-roaders in power burned in Li Youzhi's heart. He stood up and engaged in a face-to-face struggle with a bad element in the Party branch committee, exposing that person's ugly face with ironclad facts.

Just as the Red Rebels were considering accepting Li Youzhi into the Red Rebel Corps, Li Youzhi came forward again with his application. All the Red Rebels in the workshop unanimously applauded and approved his joining the ranks of the Red Rebels.

Li Youzhi excitedly said: "I applied to join the Red Rebel Corps to do the revolution. Now that I have joined the Red Rebel Corps, I will work with tenfold, hundredfold effort to do the revolution and will not rest until we achieve victory in both revolution and production!"

On January 18, Li Youzhi and the Red Rebels of Workshop Eleven raised the banner of "Seizing Power is Justified," seizing all leadership powers from the hands of the capitalist-roaders in power, firmly grasping the fate of the Cultural Revolution and production in the hands of the revolutionary faction.

Seizing power is just the first step of the long march. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are not willing to accept their defeat and always try to counterattack the revolutionary rebels. Li Youzhi said: "We must be determined! We must not let the enemy laugh at us." The Red Rebels resolutely said: "Right! We dare to seize power and we dare to hold it, and we must hold it even better!"

"Rouse the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants to work with one heart!" Li Youzhi and the Red Rebels closely united, did meticulous ideological work among the deceived workers, and formed a powerful revolutionary army.

In the face of the Red Rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all difficulties will be overcome. In the last eight days of January, production surged and exceeded the monthly production target.

The Red Rebels of Workshop Eleven deeply felt: "Revolutionary cadres are the Party's precious wealth. United with them and fighting together will make our revolution and production advance by leaps and bounds."

    坚定地和革命群众一起战斗 
    ——记车间副主任李有志同志
    哈尔滨电机厂十一车间副主任李有志，在文化大革命运动中，经历了多次考验，始终坚定地站在革命造反派一边。他是千万个革命干部中的普通一员，从他这几个月的斗争中可以看出，我们的许多干部是好的，是敢于革命，敢于造反的；也可以看出我们革命造反派又是怎样认真地考察干部，热情地爱护和支持革命的干部的。
    李有志，是个年青的共产党员。他在四清运动中，经历了阶级斗争风雨的考验，由一个工人提拔为车间副主任。文化大革命开始不久，红色造反者高举着“造反有理”的大旗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了斗争。他们那种敢打敢冲的革命精神，强烈地鼓舞着李有志，他写出了第一份要求加入红色造反团的申请书。
    红色造反者拿着李有志的申请书，展开了热烈的讨论。他们认为，李有志从“四清”以来，工作认真负责，踏实肯干，有雷厉风行的作风。但是，运动刚刚开始，还不能充分肯定他是个真正的革命者。于是，红色造反团决定，对他还要进行考验。
    群众运动的烈火烧得越来越旺了。有的家伙撂挑子不干了。生产受着严重的威胁。红色造反者挺起胸脯，挑起了生产的重担。
    同时，红色造反团找到李有志，动员他出来共同抓生产，李有志满怀信心地说：“我是贫农的儿子，是毛主席教导出来的干部，一定要积极参加革命，一定要搞好生产。”
    在十一车间，装配组和电焊组是生产上的关键，直接关系到全厂任务的完成。牵牛要牵牛鼻子，他亲自来抓这两个组。毛主席说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”李有志牢牢记住了毛主席的教导，坚信群众是真正的英雄，只要依靠群众，就会无往而不胜。他和红色造反者以及其他老工人团结在一起，紧张地进行工作。电焊组人少活杂，他就自己拿起工具来干。
    在李有志带动下，经过红色造反者的艰苦奋斗，终于提前一个季度完成了去年全年的生产任务。红色造反者无不欢欣鼓舞。
    在抓生产方面，李有志经受住了考验。但是对一个干部，更应该在阶级斗争的风浪中去识别，去检验。
    十一车间揭发批判大会开始了。一股对走资本主义道路当权派的仇恨怒火，燃烧在李有志心头。他跳起来，同党支部委员会中的一个坏家伙进行了针锋相对的斗争，用铁的事实揭露了那个家伙的丑恶嘴脸。
    正当红色造反者酝酿接受李有志加入红色造反团的时候，李有志又拿着他的申请书走来了。全车间的红色造反者一致鼓掌通过，欢迎他加入到红色造反者的行列。
    李有志兴奋地说：“我要求加入红色造反团，是为了干革命。我加入了红色造反团，就要以十倍、百倍的努力来干革命，不夺取革命、生产双胜利誓不罢休！”
    一月十八日，李有志和十一车间的红色造反者高举着“夺权有理”的大旗，把一切领导大权从走资本主义道路当权派的手里夺回来了，把文化大革命的命运，把生产的命运牢牢掌握在革命派的手中了。
    夺权，只是万里长征走完了第一步。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并不甘心自己的失败，他们总想向革命造反派反扑。李有志说：“我们要争气啊！千万不能让敌人看我们的笑话。”红色造反者们斩钉截铁地说：“对！权，我们敢夺就敢掌，而且要掌得更好！”
    “唤起工农千百万，同心干”！李有志和红色造反者紧密地团结起来，对受蒙蔽的职工作了细致的思想工作，组成了一支强大的革命大军。
    在用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色造反者面前，一切困难都会被克服，在一月份最后的八天中，产值猛增，并超额完成了全月的生产任务。
    十一车间的红色造反者深有感受地说：“革命的干部是党的宝贵财富，同他们团结起来，共同战斗，就会使我们的革命和生产突飞猛进。”
