The Zhejiang Province Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Revolutionary Rebel Joint Command has issued an emergency notice, calling on all revolutionary rebels in the countryside, revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are urged to immediately launch a new high tide of spring plowing production and strive for a greater and more comprehensive leap in agricultural production this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 15th: The Zhejiang Province Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Revolutionary Rebel Joint Command has issued an emergency notice, calling on all revolutionary rebels in the countryside, revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres to intensify the revolution and promote spring plowing. The full text of the emergency notice is as follows:

"Currently, during the spring plowing season, I hope that all comrades, cadres, and masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year."

Mao Zedong

Under the personal leadership and direction of our great leader Chairman Mao, the peasant class cultural revolution in our province, like in other parts of the country, is surging forward with an irresistible momentum. Our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have formed a vast revolutionary rebel army and bravely "come out" to fight. We have displayed the spirit of being masters of the house, shouldering both the burdens of revolution and production, intensifying the revolution, and vigorously preparing for plowing. The countryside is in a great situation!

However, "the enemy will not perish of itself." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the countryside will not readily accept their defeat. They will make desperate struggles. They use various vile and malicious means to suppress the revolutionary peasant movement. They promote counter-revolutionary economism, attempting to divert this serious political struggle onto the wrong path. More seriously, to pressure the rural cultural revolution, they even lie down and do nothing during the busy spring plowing season, abandoning their responsibilities. They even collude with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to sabotage production and the collective economy, aiming to sabotage socialist construction and the rural cultural revolution. If we do not expose their evil plots in time and give them a powerful counterattack, we will not be able to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The editorial in the February 11th issue of the People's Daily pointed out: "Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The good or bad harvest of agriculture directly affects the national economy and people's livelihood, and also directly affects the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country." We must seriously understand the spirit of the editorial in the People's Daily, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and while focusing on the cultural revolution, immediately launch a new high tide of spring plowing production, striving for a greater and more comprehensive leap in agricultural production this year.

The year's plan lies in spring. Currently, the spring has already passed, and the busy season for spring plowing production is about to arrive. We must seize the opportunity and act without delay. We issue this notice to call on all revolutionary rebels in the countryside, revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres to resolutely implement it.

1. The more intense the struggle, the more we must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary rebel organizations in various rural areas should, together with the masses, seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." We should study the "Old Three Articles" with problems in mind, carry out a thorough revolution in our souls, overthrow the "self," and establish the "public." We should arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. This is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in both revolution and production.

2. Revolutionary cadres in various rural areas should always stand with the revolutionary rebels, firmly supporting the rebels in their revolutionary struggles, and boldly taking the lead in guiding the preparation for plowing and spring plowing production. Revolutionary rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants should firmly support them and fight side by side. For cadres who have made general mistakes, we should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's consistent teaching of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," supervise them to do a good job in production and work, allowing them to make amends. Even for cadres who have made serious mistakes but are willing to repent, we should supervise them to participate in production and work, allowing them to redeem themselves. For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the few stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, we should mobilize the masses to resolutely strike them down and seize power from them.

3. Revolutionary rebel organizations in various rural areas should unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve great unity. Only by achieving great unity among the revolutionary masses can we truly seize the power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We must resolutely oppose clanism, factionalism, and other wrong tendencies. At the same time, we must also oppose the hodgepodge of various elements. Revolutionary rebel organizations in various rural areas that have achieved great unity should display the spirit of being masters of the house, together with revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants with production experience, quickly establish small groups or committees to grasp revolution and promote production, and ensure the normal progress of agricultural production.

4. We must resolutely implement the Party's class line and class policy in the countryside. Both revolution and production must firmly rely on poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, unite middle peasants, and gradually achieve the unity of more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, not allowing the struggle to be directed at middle peasants, nor allowing the struggle to be directed at general cadres of production teams and brigades.

5. In areas with conditions, revolutionary rebel organizations of communes and brigades can each send an observer to participate in production and inspect the situation of the cultural revolution and production, exchange experiences, and timely report the situation to the higher-level revolutionary rebel organizations. The work points of the observers should be taken care of by the brigades.

6. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction of "comprehensive planning and proper arrangement," we should immediately inspect the year-end distribution work to ensure a good start and finish. We should correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the members, oppose dividing and using up everything, ensure sufficient funds for spring plowing production, oppose counter-revolutionary economism in distribution, strictly prohibit private division of public accumulation and reserve grains, prohibit slaughtering draft animals, prohibit private felling of trees and bamboo, oppose dividing small production teams, and oppose all behaviors that sabotage production and the collective economy.

7. Revolutionary rebels in rural industries, handicrafts, transportation, commerce, supply and marketing, credit, and banking, and all departments related to agricultural production should immediately take action, regarding supporting spring plowing production as their glorious task. Through investigation and research, we should understand the situation and satisfy the rural demand for production materials, production funds, and other materials as much as possible.

8. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary students in the countryside should blend in with the poor and lower-middle peasants, carrying out revolution while engaging in production. Rural revolutionary rebels and poor and lower-middle peasants should unite with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary students under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and should not listen to the slander and provocation of a few bad elements. Knowledgeable youth who have gone to the countryside but are still lingering in the cities should leave their opinions behind and immediately return to their hometowns, carry out revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and actively participate in the preparation for plowing and spring plowing production.

9. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "save on revolution" and "run the commune thriftily," carry forward the spirit of Dazhai, be self-reliant, strive hard, and save on preparation for plowing. Members of revolutionary rebel organizations at all levels of communes, brigades, and production teams should actively participate in the preparation for plowing and spring plowing production and should not leave production; all agricultural labor force should not leave their production posts at will. The rural cultural revolution should, as much as possible, not occupy production time.

10. We must strengthen proletarian dictatorship. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside, and those who have been removed from power during the Four Cleanups and are capitalist-roaders, should be allowed to behave themselves and not cause trouble; if they are found to have counterattacks, sabotage production, and sabotage the cultural revolution, the revolutionary rebels should resolutely strike them down and implement dictatorship over them.

11. Revolutionary rebel leadership teams at all levels in the countryside should immediately mobilize the masses to inspect the current production. We should focus on cultivating spring flowers and green manure, vigorously accumulate and produce fertilizer, do a good job in spring water conservancy, raise draft animals well, and inspect the preparation of seeds and tools. Mountainous areas should immediately close mountains for afforestation and vigorously promote greening. In the evaluation of work points, we should insist on highlighting politics, oppose work points being the boss, not allow work points to be raised, and not allow work points to be supplemented without reason.

12. In accordance with the policy of "grain as the key link and diversified operations," we should fully carry forward democracy, formulate spring plowing production plans and the 1967 production plan. The production plan should be implemented to the production team, and everyone should have a clear understanding.

"Many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, all revolutionary rebels in the countryside, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," seize the opportunity, take immediate action, intensify the revolution, vigorously promote preparation for plowing, and launch the first shot of spring plowing to achieve double victories in revolution and production!

    浙江省贫下中农革命造反联合总指挥部发出紧急通告
    大抓革命　狠促春耕
    呼吁全省农村革命造反派同志、革命的贫下中农和革命群众、革命干部，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，立即掀起一个春耕生产新高潮，争取今年农业生产有一个更大的更全面的跃进。
    新华社杭州十五日电　浙江省贫下中农革命造反联合总指挥部发出紧急通告，呼吁全省农村革命造反派同志、革命的贫下中农和革命群众、革命干部，大抓革命，狠促春耕。紧急通告全文如下：
      “目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”
                              毛泽东
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导下，我省农村无产阶级文化大革命和全国各地一样，正以排山倒海之势向前发展。我们广大贫下中农组成了浩浩荡荡的革命造反大军，勇敢地“杀”出来了。我们发扬了当家作主精神，挑起了革命和生产两副担子，大抓革命，狠搞备耕。农村是一片大好形势！
    但是，“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，决不会甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。他们采取各种卑鄙恶毒的手段，镇压革命农民运动。他们大搞反革命经济主义，企图把这场严肃的政治斗争引向邪路。更严重的是，他们为了对农村文化大革命施加压力，竟在备耕生产紧张的时候躺倒不干，撒手不管。他们甚至勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子破坏生产，破坏集体经济，以达到他们破坏社会主义建设、破坏农村文化大革命的目的。我们如果不及时戳穿他们的罪恶阴谋，不对他们给予有力的反击，就不可能取得革命、生产的双胜利。
    《人民日报》二月十一日的社论指出：“农业是国民经济的基础。农业收成的好坏，直接影响着国计民生，也直接影响着我国的无产阶级文化大革命运动。”我们要认真领会《人民日报》社论精神，坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，在抓好文化大革命的同时，立即掀起一个春耕生产新高潮，争取今年农业生产有一个更大的更全面的跃进。
    一年之计在于春。目前立春已过，春耕生产大忙的季节就要到来，机不可失，时不再来。我们特发出这一通告，呼吁农村革命造反派同志、革命的贫下中农和革命群众、革命干部坚决贯彻执行。
    一，越是斗争紧张的时候，越是要活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗举得更高。农村各地革命造反派组织要和广大群众一起，认真学习毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”等指示。要带着问题活学活用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处闹革命，打倒“私”字，大立“公”字，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，促进人的思想革命化。这是搞好革命和生产的最根本的保证。
    二，农村各地革命的领导干部应当永远和革命造反派站在一起，既要坚决支持革命造反派闹革命，又必须挺身而出，大胆领导好备耕工作和春耕生产。革命造反派同志和广大贫下中农应当坚决支持他们，和他们并肩战斗。对于犯有一般错误的干部，要本着毛主席一贯教导的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，督促他们搞好生产，搞好工作，要他们将功补过。就是对于犯有严重错误而又愿意悔改的干部，也应当监督他们参加生产和工作，允许他们将功赎罪。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，应当发动群众坚决打击，彻底夺权。
    三，农村各地革命造反派要在毛泽东思想的旗帜下实行大联合，要在革命农民运动的大风大浪中实行大联合。只有实行了无产阶级革命派大联合，才能真正把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃据的权力统统夺过来。坚决反对宗族主义、小团体主义等等错误倾向。同时也要反对杂七杂八的大杂烩。农村各地革命造反派实行了大联合，要发扬当家作主的精神，同革命干部和有生产经验的贫下中农一起，迅速建立抓革命、促生产的小组或委员会，切实挑起备耕和春耕生产的担子，保证农业生产的正常进行。
    四，坚决贯彻执行党在农村中的阶级路线和阶级政策，革命和生产，都必须坚定地依靠贫农、下中农，团结中农，逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部。要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，决不允许把斗争的矛头指向中农，也决不允许把斗争的矛头指向大队的一般干部和生产队干部。
    五，在有条件的地方，公社、大队的革命造反派组织可以相互派一名观察员，一面参加生产，一面检查了解文化大革命和生产情况，互相交流经验，及时向上一级革命造反派组织反映情况。观察员的工分由大队负责。
    六，要根据毛主席“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的指示，立即检查一次年终分配工作，保证善始善终搞好年终分配。要正确处理国家、集体和社员三者之间的关系，反对分光用光，保证有充足的春耕生产资金，反对在分配中的反革命经济主义。严格禁止私分公共积累和储备粮，禁止宰杀耕牛，禁止私自上山砍伐树木、毛竹，反对分小生产队，反对一切破坏生产、破坏集体经济的行为。
    七，农村工业、手工业、交通运输、商业、供销、信用、银行等一切与农业生产有关部门的革命造反派，要立即行动起来，把支援春耕生产当作自己的光荣任务。要通过调查研究，摸清情况，尽可能地满足农村对生产资料、生产资金和其它物资的需要。
    八，在农村的革命干部、革命学生，要和贫下中农打成一片，一边闹革命，一边搞生产。农村革命造反派和贫下中农，要同革命干部、革命学生在毛泽东思想的旗帜下团结起来，决不要听一小撮坏人的挑拨离间。尚逗留在城市的上山下乡知识青年，应当把自己上访的意见留下来，立即返回本地，和贫下中农一起闹革命，积极参加备耕和春耕生产。
    九，坚决响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”和“勤俭办社”的伟大号召，发扬大寨精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭闹备耕。公社、大队、生产队各级革命造反派组织的成员，要积极参加备耕和春耕生产，不要脱离生产；所有农业劳动力不得随意离开生产岗位。农村文化大革命，尽量不占用生产时间。
    十，要加强无产阶级专政。农村中的地、富、反、坏、右分子和四清运动中下台的那些走资本主义道路的当权派，只许他们老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动；如果发现他们有反攻倒算，破坏生产，破坏文化大革命的行为，革命造反派要对他们坚决打击，实行专政。
    十一，农村各级抓革命、促生产的领导班子，要立即发动群众检查一次当前生产。要抓紧培育春花、绿肥，大搞积肥造肥，搞好春修水利，养好耕牛，检查一下良种和农具的准备情况。山区要立即封山育林，大搞绿化。在评工记分中，要坚持突出政治，反对工分挂帅，不准抬高工分，不准无故补贴工分。
    十二，要根据“以粮为纲，多种经营”的方针，充分发扬大民主，制订春耕生产计划和一九六七年生产规划。生产规划要落实到生产队，要做到人人心中有数。
      “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”革命的贫下中农们，农村一切革命造反派同志们，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，抓紧时机，立即行动，大搞革命，狠促备耕，打响春耕第一炮，夺取革命和生产双胜利！
