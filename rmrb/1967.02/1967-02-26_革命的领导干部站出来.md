Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao teaches us: “After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor.”

Most of our cadres at all levels have come through the stormy seas of class struggle, following our great supreme commander Chairman Mao, and have made contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people and to socialist revolution and construction. They have rich experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They are politically mature and have strong organizational abilities. They resolutely step forward to rebel and unite with the broad revolutionary masses, which is an important condition for the victory of the proletarian revolutionary forces in the struggle for power.

We are the loyal defenders and resolute executors of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: “One must be good at identifying cadres. One must not only look at a cadre’s single action or single event, but must also look at the cadre’s entire history and entire work, which is the main method for identifying cadres.” We must act according to Chairman Mao’s teachings. For cadres, we must strictly distinguish between those who are in power for the proletariat and those who are in power for the bourgeoisie; we must strictly distinguish between those who formulate and those who execute the bourgeois reactionary line, and between those who are deceived and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. The facts prove that those in power who take the capitalist road are a small minority, and the majority of cadres resolutely execute Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and have resisted and fought against the bourgeois reactionary line. Although some people were temporarily deceived and executed the wrong line, making this or that mistake, they love Chairman Mao. Once they become aware, they will unhesitatingly stand on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Therefore, in the struggle, we must firmly rely on cadres who have consistently executed Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, unite more than 95% of the cadres, and isolate and strike at a small handful of those in power who take the capitalist road. For those who were temporarily deceived and executed the wrong line, making this or that mistake, we must resolutely follow the policy of “punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient” and “unity-criticism-unity,” and enthusiastically and actively help them step forward to rebel.

At the same time, we call on all revolutionary cadres not to lie on their past merits and sleep, nor to bear the burden of mistakes and lie down. For the revolution, for the people, make new contributions! Break with selfishness and establish public spirit! Bravely step forward to rebel to defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line! Respond to Chairman Mao’s great call, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better!

    革命的领导干部站出来
    北京医学院井冈山
    我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”
    我们的各级领导干部大多数是从阶级斗争的险风恶浪中，跟随着我们伟大的统帅毛主席冲杀过来的，他们为中国人民的解放事业和社会主义革命与建设立过功劳。他们进行阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的经验比较丰富；他们政治上比较成熟；组织能力比较强。他们坚定地站出来造反，和广大革命群众结合在一起，这是无产阶级革命派能否取得夺权斗争胜利的重要条件。
    我们是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的忠实捍卫者和坚决执行者。毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”我们一定要按照毛主席的教导办事。对于领导干部，必须严格区分是无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路当权派；严格区分是制定还是执行资产阶级反动路线的，是受蒙蔽还是顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的。事实证明，走资本主义道路的当权派是极少数，大多数干部是坚决执行毛主席的革命路线的，对资产阶级反动路线进行过抵制和斗争。虽然有的人一时受蒙蔽，或多或少地执行了错误路线，犯了这样或那样的错误。但是，他们是热爱毛主席的，一旦觉悟了，就会毫不犹豫地站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。因此，我们在斗争中，必须坚决依靠一贯执行毛主席的革命路线的领导干部，团结百分之九十五以上的干部，孤立和打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。对于一时受蒙蔽执行了错误路线，犯了这样或那样的错误的同志，坚决按着“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，热情地主动地帮助他们站出来造反。
    同时，我们呼吁一切要革命的领导干部不要躺在过去的功劳上睡大觉，也不要因为犯了错误而背上包袱躺倒不起，要为革命，为人民立新功！破私立公，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，勇敢地站出来造反！响应毛主席的伟大号召，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好！
