	The Chinese people are not to be intimidated or deceived!

	Forty-eight of our fishermen were forcibly seized by American imperialism for more than a month. American imperialism, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the South Vietnamese puppet regime, subjected the seized fishermen to brutal persecution and used coercion and enticement to extract military, political, and economic intelligence from them. This is a major political conspiracy jointly plotted by American imperialism and its lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the South Vietnamese puppet regime. It is another serious provocation by American imperialism against the great Chinese people. The Chinese people express strong indignation over this and have lodged a serious protest with the U.S. government!

	The Johnson administration has recently been spreading the word that it is willing to "ease" relations with China. Johnson himself, in this year's State of the Union address, talked at length about achieving "reconciliation" with China. After the incident of American warships seizing our fishermen, American imperialism has been loudly propagating that it "rescued" the Chinese fishermen in distress. This is sheer shamelessness! But how can a pair of white gloves hide the blood-stained hands of a murderer? What is clearly a barbaric act of piracy, American imperialism can describe as an act of "benevolence" towards the Chinese people. What is clearly a devil can pretend to wear a human skin. This is, of course, futile. We warn Johnson to put away his tricks!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not reconcile themselves to their defeat in China. They will still collude with each other and use every possible means to oppose the Chinese people. ... We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the imperialists and their running dogs' desperate plots of revenge."

	This incident of American imperialism seizing our fishermen once again proves the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have long seen through the true nature of American imperialism. We are always ready to seriously deal with American imperialism's armed aggression. If the enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely annihilate it! This is the pledge of the great Chinese people.

    中国人民是吓不倒，骗不了的！
    本报评论员
    我国四十八名渔民，被美帝国主义强行劫持达一个多月之久。美帝国主义勾结蒋介石匪帮和南越傀儡集团，对被劫持的我国渔民进行了残酷的迫害，并采取逼供利诱等等卑鄙手段，搜集我国军事、政治、经济情报。这是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮和南越傀儡集团共同策划的一个重大政治阴谋，是美帝国主义对伟大的中国人民的又一次严重挑衅。中国人民对此表示强烈的愤慨，并且向美国政府提出严重抗议！
    约翰逊政府最近不断放出空气，表示愿意同中国“缓和”关系。约翰逊本人在今年的国情咨文里，就大谈要同中国“实现和解”。在美国军舰劫走我国渔民事件发生以后，美帝国主义又大肆宣传什么它“搭救了中国遇难渔民”。真是无耻到了极点！但是，一副白手套怎么能够掩藏得了杀人强盗的血淋淋的双手呢？明明是野蛮的海盗行为，而美帝国主义却可以把它说成是对中国人民的“仁慈”。明明是鬼，却偏偏要披上一件人的画皮。这当然是徒劳的。正告约翰逊，还是收起你的那一套鬼把戏吧！
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。……我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”。
    这次美帝国主义劫持我国渔民的事件，又一次证明了毛主席指出的这个真理。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民早就看透了美帝国主义的本性。我们时刻准备着认真对待美帝国主义的武装侵略。敌人胆敢来侵犯，就坚决消灭它！这就是伟大中国人民的誓言。
