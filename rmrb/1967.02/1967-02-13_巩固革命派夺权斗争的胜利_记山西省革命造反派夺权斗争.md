In the thunderous roar of revolutionary rebellion, the revolutionary masses of Shanxi have achieved great unity based on Mao Zedong Thought, forming a powerful revolutionary force, and seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party!

The great victory of the revolutionary masses' seizure of power in Shanxi has written a glorious chapter in the annals of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It provides new experience for the proletarian revolutionary seizure of power ongoing in various parts of the country and makes a new contribution to China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieving great unity among the revolutionary masses, and implementing the "three-in-one combination"

Chairman Mao says: "Organize tens of thousands, even millions of people, and mobilize a vast revolutionary army—this is the need of the revolution today as it advances against the counter-revolution."

For a long time, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee has inflicted various cruel persecutions on the revolutionary masses. This has made the broad revolutionary masses see more clearly the ferocious face of the enemy. Common struggles, common destinies, and common feelings have made the revolutionary masses quickly unite and rally under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This great unity includes revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and general revolutionary cadres, as well as revolutionary military personnel and revolutionary leading cadres. This broad unity has isolated the enemy to the greatest extent, surrounding the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Provincial Party Committee.

	Under the banner of revolutionary great unity, batch after batch of revolutionary rebel forces have stood up.

	Within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, a group of revolutionary leading cadres have stood up. Led by Comrade Liu Ge Ping, five leading cadres have firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in the life-and-death struggle between the two lines. On January 10, they posted a big-character poster fiercely attacking the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Provincial Party Committee. This action won the enthusiastic support of the broad revolutionary masses. Some of these revolutionary leading cadres have long been in uncompromising struggle with the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, both at the central and local levels. During the Cultural Revolution, they have undergone the test of the mass movement. At the critical moment of the seizure of power, they fearlessly stood up, not afraid of being labeled as "ambitious" or "puppet masters," not afraid of temporary misunderstandings or distrust from the masses, not afraid of attacks and curses from the royalists, and resolutely joined the revolutionary masses in battle and victory. The broad revolutionary masses, through long-term struggles, have recognized these cadres. They use the class analysis viewpoint to see that these cadres stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line. Thus, the revolutionary masses, disregarding some people's gossip, fearlessly united with these leading cadres, opening up a new situation for the Cultural Revolution.

	The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, has also given strong support to the broad revolutionary masses. The second political commissar of the Shanxi Military Region, Comrade Zhang Ri Qing, and the broad cadres and soldiers consciously and faithfully executed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, broke through the various restrictions hindering the revolution, and firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary masses, directly participating in the seizure of power on January 12. This greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary masses and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the counter-revolutionary revisionists and the bourgeois royalists.

	Some reactionaries are terrified of the revolutionary masses' great unity and spare no effort in spreading rumors and slanders.

	"You are being manipulated by those in power and used by bad elements." This is their attempt to slander the revolutionary masses with a dagger.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." To assume that all those in power are bad and to distrust and overthrow them all is a thought that completely contradicts the class analysis viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought. A handful of cunning elements attempt to sow discord, separate the revolutionary masses from the revolutionary leading cadres, and achieve the goal of destroying the great unity of the revolutionary left. We must not let their plots succeed. It is an urgent task to struggle against the petty-bourgeois and anarchist ideologies. This is the key to whether we can persist in Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the end. The revolutionary masses must decisively break with anarchist ideologies.

	"You do not believe in the masses liberating themselves."

	Strange! When revolutionary leading cadres and the broad revolutionary masses jointly seize power, is this called not believing in the masses liberating themselves? In fact, it is precisely because the revolutionary leading cadres support and execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and have relatively rich experience in struggle and strong organizational abilities that they can more fully mobilize the masses and arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.

	"The military supporting the local Cultural Revolution is illegal."

	What nonsense! In the past, the handful of bourgeois gentlemen in the Provincial Party Committee used the political and public security organs to suppress the revolutionary masses, sent armed spies to tail the revolutionary masses, and you did not utter a word; at the critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the great People's Liberation Army stood up, sided with the revolutionary masses, resolutely suppressed the counter-revolution, and implemented proletarian dictatorship, and this became a great crime, a violation of law and discipline! What a reactionary logic!

	The reactionary attacks have made the great unity of the revolutionary masses more solid and their combat effectiveness stronger. In the midst of the enemy's curses, the revolutionary masses of Shanxi have further seen who their enemies are and who their comrades are, purged the dregs within their own ranks, and united more closely.

	Thoroughly smash the bourgeois dictatorship organs controlled by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and establish proletarian revolutionary power organs

	At the critical moment of the revolutionary masses' great unity and great seizure of power in Shanxi, the "Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" was born, taking over all the power of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee and managing the provincial party and government affairs.

	The establishment of the "Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" is of great significance. It is the embryonic form of a new organizational form of the proletarian dictatorship organs.

	The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, under the long-term control of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, has rotted away. They practiced bourgeois dictatorship instead of proletarian dictatorship. Such power organs must be thoroughly smashed and new power organs created to replace them. Only in this way can the revolutionary masses truly consolidate the power they have seized and ensure that the revolution develops in the correct direction.

	The members of the "Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" are elected by a representative congress jointly composed of revolutionary mass organizations, Shanxi garrison troops, and revolutionary leading cadres. All major and principled issues are discussed and decided by the representative congress. Daily affairs are handled by the General Headquarters. The General Headquarters includes workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, as well as revolutionary military personnel and revolutionary leading cadres. They are all revolutionary pioneers who have emerged in the intense class struggles of the Cultural Revolution. They have relatively close ties with the masses and are trusted by the masses. The revolutionary leading cadres working in the General Headquarters follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." They put down their airs and sit on the same level with ordinary "common people," discussing problems together. As one member of the Headquarters said: "We are both the masses and the leaders, and we are all servants of the people." The revolutionary masses supervise and criticize the staff of the General Headquarters, and if they are unqualified, they can be replaced at any time. The broad revolutionary masses expressed their firm support for the leadership of the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, saying: "This is our own power, we trust it, we support it!" Under the leadership of the General Headquarters, many places have established regional "Seizure of Power Committees." The "Seizure of Power Committees" are jointly composed of representatives of local revolutionary rebel organizations, with representatives from the General Headquarters participating. This further consolidates and strengthens the great unity of the revolutionary left and ensures the rapid development of the seizure of power struggle throughout the province. The General Headquarters firmly implements Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production" and establishes a "Production Committee" to lead the industrial and agricultural production construction of the entire province.

	Fully utilize revolutionary authority to launch a comprehensive seizure of power struggle

	The "Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" pays great attention to the role of revolutionary authority, fully utilizes the power seized, and resolutely implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The comrades of the General Headquarters say: "Our power is granted by the people of Shanxi and affirmed by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. The responsibility of leading the revolution of the entire province, we revolutionary rebels will take it! The weapons to suppress counter-revolutionaries, we revolutionary rebels will wield them! We have the courage to seize power, and we have the determination to hold power! If we only occupy a few empty buildings and seize a few seals, that is only seizing empty power. We must mobilize the revolutionary masses in various organs, factories, and rural areas to exercise the revolutionary power we have seized and launch a comprehensive seizure of power struggle throughout the province." On January 14, representatives of the General Headquarters went to the "Shanxi Provincial Proletarian Cultural Revolution Reception Station" where economicism was rampant, first announced the takeover of the reception station, and then jointly established a management committee with the revolutionary rebels within the station, fully controlling the political and economic power of the reception station. In the Taiyuan Textile Mill where the royalist forces were rampant, representatives of the General Headquarters and PLA soldiers helped the mill's revolutionary rebels—the "Red Guards" seize the power of the entire mill and implemented dictatorship over a handful of reactionaries who opposed the General Headquarters and resisted the revolutionary seizure of power. In the judicial departments, representatives of the General Headquarters, revolutionary workers, peasants, students, soldiers, and rebels within the judicial departments combined to form a "Proletarian Dictatorship Committee," unifying the power of the original Provincial Public Security Bureau, Court, and Procuratorate, strongly supporting the revolutionary rebels, and ruthlessly suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

	Now, under the leadership of the General Headquarters, the revolutionary rebels of the entire Shanxi Province are launching a new offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, like a sudden storm, driving one after another counter-revolutionary revisionist off their thrones, and their counter-revolutionary organizations are collapsing one after another. The experience of Shanxi shows: it is necessary to establish an authoritative revolutionary organ to lead the seizure of power struggle throughout the province and fully utilize the role of revolutionary authority to suppress the struggles and counterattacks of reactionary forces. Only in this way can the seizure of power struggle be ensured to develop victoriously.

	The proletarian revolutionary rebels of Shanxi, under the brilliant guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, are advancing victoriously. They will break through all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and truly become the masters of Shanxi. A bright red new Shanxi will surely appear before the people of the entire country!

    巩固革命派夺权斗争的胜利
    ——记山西省革命造反派夺权斗争
    本报太原讯　在惊天动地的革命造反声中，山西的革命造反派实现了在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合，形成了强大的革命力量，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中，把大权夺过来了！
    山西省革命造反派夺权斗争的重大胜利，在无产阶级文化大革命的史册上写下了光辉的一页。它给全国各地正在进行的无产阶级革命夺权斗争提供了新的经验，为我国无产阶级文化大革命作出了新的贡献。
      高举毛泽东思想的伟大红
  旗，实行无产阶级革命派的大联
  合，实行“三结合”
    毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”
    长期以来，山西省委内的反革命修正主义集团向革命造反派施加了种种残酷迫害，这使广大革命造反派愈来愈清楚地看透了他们的狰狞面目。共同的斗争、共同的命运、共同的感情，使革命造反派在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，迅速地联合起来，团结起来了。这个大联合不仅包括革命工人、革命农民、革命学生、革命知识分子和一般革命干部，而且包括了革命军人和革命的领导干部。这个广泛的大联合，最大限度地孤立了敌人，使省委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子陷入了革命群众的重重包围之中。
    在革命大联合的旗帜下，一批又一批的革命造反队伍站出来了。
    山西省委内一批革命的领导干部站出来了。以刘格平同志为首的五位领导干部，在两条路线的生死搏斗中，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，一月十日贴出了向省委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子猛烈开火的大字报。他们这一行动获得了广大革命造反派的热烈支持。这些革命的领导干部中的一部分同志，长期以来在中央和地方就同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作过不调和的斗争。在文化大革命中，他们经受了群众运动的考验。在夺权斗争的关键时刻，他们不怕戴上“野心家”、“幕后操纵”的大帽子，不怕群众暂时的不理解、不信任，不怕保皇派的围攻咒骂，毅然决然站出来，和革命造反派战斗在一起，胜利在一起。广大的革命造反派战士，在长期的斗争中，也识别了这些干部。他们用阶级分析的观点，看清了他们是站在无产阶级革命路线一边的。于是，革命造反派不顾一些人的风言风语，不怕扣“走上层路线”、
  “脱离群众”的帽子，毅然决然地和这些领导干部们结合在一起，给文化大革命开创了一个新的局面。
    无限忠于毛主席的中国人民解放军也给了广大革命群众以有力的支援。山西军区第二政委张日清同志和广大指战员，自觉地忠实地执行了毛主席的革命路线，打破了阻碍革命的条条框框，坚决站在革命造反派一边，直接参与了一月十二日的夺权斗争。这样就大长特长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭特灭了反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级保皇派的威风。
    一些反动家伙对革命派大联合害怕得要死，极尽其造谣污蔑之能事。
    “你们受当权派操纵，被坏人利用了。”这是他们企图中伤革命造反派的一把匕首。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”以为凡是当权派都不是好东西，就一概不信任，就一概打倒，这种否定一切、排斥一切的思想是根本违背毛泽东思想的阶级分析的观点的。一小撮阴险的家伙，妄图播弄是非，离间革命造反派和革命领导干部之间的关系，达到破坏革命左派大联合的目的，我们决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。同小资产阶级思潮、无政府主义思潮作斗争，是当前迫在眉睫的任务。这是能否把毛主席的革命路线坚持到底的关键。革命造反派一定要和无政府主义思潮决裂。
      “你们不相信群众自己解放自己。”
    奇怪！革命的领导干部和广大革命群众一齐起来夺权，就叫不相信群众自己解放自己吗？其实，正是由于革命的领导干部拥护和执行毛主席的革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，他们又有比较丰富的斗争经验和较强的组织能力，就能更充分地发动群众，调动群众的革命积极性。
      “军队支持地方文化大革命是非法的。”
    岂有此理！过去，省委里那一小撮资产阶级老爷们动用政法、公安等专政机器镇压革命造反派，派遣武装特务对革命造反派进行盯梢，你们吭也不吭一声；在两个阶级决战的关键时刻，伟大的人民解放军挺身而出，站在革命造反派一边，坚决镇压反革命，实行无产阶级专政，倒成了大逆不道，违法乱纪了！真是反动的逻辑！
    反动的围攻使革命派的大联合更加巩固，战斗力更强了。山西的革命造反派在敌人的咒骂声中，进一步看清了谁是自己的敌人，谁是自己的同志，清除了自己队伍中的渣滓，更加紧密地团结起来了。

    彻底打碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派控制的资产阶级专政机构，建立无产阶级的革命权力机构
    在山西革命造反派大联合、大夺权的关键时刻，“山西革命造反总指挥部”诞生了，它接管了山西省委和省人委的一切权力，掌管全省的党政大权。
      “山西革命造反总指挥部”的成立具有重大意义。它是无产阶级专政机构的新的组织形式的萌芽。
    山西省委在一小撮反革命修正主义分子的长期盘踞下已经烂掉了，他们实行的不是无产阶级专政而是资产阶级专政。对于这样的政权机构必须彻底打碎，并创造新的政权机构来代替。只有这样，革命造反派才能把夺到手的权力真正巩固起来，才能保证革命沿着正确的方向发展。
      “山西革命造反总指挥部”的成员是由革命群众组织、山西驻军和革命领导干部共同组成的代表大会选举产生的。一切重大的、原则性的问题都交代表大会讨论决定。日常事务由总指挥部处理。总指挥部中有工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子，也有革命军人和革命的领导干部。他们都是在文化大革命的激烈阶级斗争中涌现出来的革命闯将，他们和群众有比较密切的联系，得到群众的信任。那些在总指挥部工作的革命的领导干部，遵循毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”放下架子，和普通的“老百姓”平起平坐，共同商量问题。正如指挥部一个成员说的：“我们既是群众，又是领导，大家都是人民的勤务员。”革命群众对总指挥部的工作人员进行监督和批评，如果不称职，可以随时撤换。广大革命群众表示坚决拥护革命造反总指挥部的领导，他们说：“这是我们自己的政权，我们信任它，我们支持它！”在总指挥部的领导下，许多地方成立了地区性的“夺权委员会”。“夺权委员会”由当地的革命造反派代表联合组成，总指挥部派代表参加。这就进一步巩固、壮大了革命左派的大联合，保证全省范围的夺权斗争的迅速发展。总指挥部坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，成立了“生产委员会”，领导全省的工农业生产建设。
      充分运用革命的权威，展开
  全面的夺权斗争
    “山西革命造反总指挥部”十分注意发挥革命权威的作用，充分利用夺到手的权力，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线。总指挥部的同志说：“我们的权力是山西人民授予的，是毛主席、党中央肯定了的。领导全省革命的担子，我们革命造反派不挑谁挑！镇压反革命分子的武器，我们革命造反派不拿谁拿！我们有胆量夺权，更有魄力掌权！如果只是占了几座空楼，拿了几个大印，那只是夺了虚权。我们要发动各机关、工厂、农村的革命群众，行使夺到手的革命权力，展开全省的全面夺权斗争。”一月十四日，总指挥部的代表到经济主义大肆泛滥的“山西省委无产阶级文化大革命接待站”，首先宣布接管接待站，然后和接待站内部的革命造反派联合成立了管理委员会，全面控制了接待站的政治、经济大权。在保皇势力猖獗的太原纺织厂，总指挥部的代表、解放军战士帮助这个厂的革命造反派——“红卫队”夺了全厂的大权，对一小撮反对总指挥部、抗拒革命夺权的反动分子实行了专政。在政法部门，总指挥部的代表、革命的工农商学兵代表和政法部门内部的造反派相结合，组成了“无产阶级专政委员会”，统一行使原省公安厅、法院、检察院的一切权力，大力支持革命造反派，无情镇压反革命分子。
    现在，山西全省的革命造反派在总指挥部的领导下，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开的新攻击，其势如暴风骤雨，一个个反革命修正主义分子正在从他们的宝座上滚下来，他们御用的反革命组织也纷纷瓦解。山西的经验表明：必须建立有权威的革命机构，来领导全省的夺权斗争，必须充分发挥革命权威的作用，镇压反动势力的挣扎和反扑。这样才能保证夺权斗争胜利发展。
    山西的无产阶级革命造反派，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，正乘胜前进。他们将冲破一切困难，战胜一切敌人，真正地成为山西的主人。一个鲜红鲜红的新山西必将出现在全国人民的面前！
