Winter in the Lesser Khingan Mountains
Yong Jin

At the end of October, when chrysanthemums in Beijing's parks are just beginning to bloom, goose feather-like snowflakes are already dancing in the Lesser Khingan Mountains' forest region. In winter, the working people of the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest region do not sit in warm houses. Instead, they go into the ice and snow to fell, transport, and plant. They love winter and they love ice and snow. Because they know that to build a beautiful motherland, they must complete the task of producing large quantities of timber with the greatest energy. And winter is the decisive season for them to complete this task.

	In the Miaoling Logging Area

Before dawn, snowflakes flutter in the air. Loggers carry saws and axes to the logging site. From their residence to the logging site, they have to walk several miles, jumping over many sawn trees and rugged rocks. People who have not been to the logging site cannot appreciate the arduousness of this journey.

However, the people living in the Miaoling logging area are excited. You can often hear bright whistles from people on the road in the forest, and young men happily sing love songs: "Advise my husband to go up the mountain to log, to fell large trees to build a new country. Husband, go ahead, the flat ground is easy to walk, but I fear the valleys; Husband, be careful where you step. We have houses and land, and plenty to eat and wear, Husband, don't forget Chairman Mao."

They walk to the logging site talking and laughing.

Team leader Dai Gelian looks at the tall red pines and says: "This forest aspect (i.e., the appearance of the forest) is still energetic!" They put down their axes and saws and hold a quick meeting under the trees, and then the work begins.

Dai Gelian and Su Guisheng fell trees. Several other people make skidding paths (to make it easier to move the sawn trees). In that dense red pine forest, Dai Gelian and Su Guisheng choose a standard pine tree and clean the area within two meters around it. Dai Gelian says: "We have never had an accident!" Su Guisheng, who is sawing with him, adds: "Not to mention accidents, we haven't even gotten a splinter in our hands!" In the severe winter, they take off their cotton coats and some even remove their leather hats. Beads of sweat roll down their heads as they kneel in the deep snow, sawing close to the ground. They strive to lower the stump as much as possible so that it does not exceed the prescribed twenty centimeters. In fact, due to their hard work, they have reduced the stump to zero centimeters, from sawing while standing in the past to sawing while kneeling now. The snow falls heavier and heavier, but the snow that falls on them melts immediately.

They saw more and more intently. When the tree is about to fall, Dai Gelian shouts "Downhill fall" several times, while telling Su Guisheng the safe place to go when the tree falls. They saw intently for a while longer and shouted "Downhill fall" several more times. This is the strict rule for loggers when felling, to tell everyone not to enter the area where the tree is about to fall. In his final shout of "Downhill fall," the red pine, which is thirty meters tall, falls down the slope without harming the mother tree or the young trees. This is Lao Dai's skill. In recent years, Lao Dai has quickly taught many new workers the felling techniques. He always tells new workers to stay in safe places when sawing dangerous trees. Not only has there been no casualties in their team, but they have also not damaged a single tool belonging to the public.

After they saw down the first tree, they use axes to chop off the knots of bark on the tree, because not chopping off the knots of bark easily causes the trees to suffer from diseases and insect pests. This is how they care for the motherland's forests.

Dai Gelian's team is the backbone team of the fourth work team of Miaoling. The fourth work team will complete the task of felling 70,000 cubic meters in 1953. This is just a small operation in the Yichun forest region. In the entire Yichun forest region, this operation is naturally not the slowest in completing its task, but it cannot be said to be the fastest either. Dai Gelian says that the reason they did not complete the task earlier is mainly because they lacked tools for a long time in the past. Forty percent of the entire work team did not have tools, and grain and vegetables could not be transported in. Of the sixty or so workers, forty were new. Initially, each person could only fell three cubic meters per day, but now each person can fell four to five cubic meters per day.

In less than two hours, the two of them felled five trees. In the past, people always felled trees casually and then cut them off casually. Now, they are responding to the instructions of the superiors to implement rational timber production, trying their best to make first-class timber into special-class timber, second-class timber into first-class timber, and throwing away trees into third-class timber. When Dai Gelian is sawing the treetops, he also says: "This kind of material would have been thrown away in the past, but it would be great to transport it to the mines to be used as mine props!" Timber is second only to steel, and without a large amount of timber, there is no way to build our new country. When they finish sawing the trees, they carefully pick up the pine cones. He says that their team has already picked up 13,000 this year. When he rests, he sits on the sawn trunk, opens his smiling face, and speaks of the wish he had expressed to the Party branch not long ago. He says that under the leadership of the Party, he is willing to work in the forest for life.

	Ice Roads

In winter, there is a unique and beautiful road in the Yichun forest region, which is called an ice road by the locals. Tractors and horse-drawn sleds transporting timber must rely on this ice road to pull more and run faster. If the ice road is not repaired well, it will be difficult for the Yichun forest region to complete the transportation task under the current conditions. In 1950, the Wudaoku branch of the Yichun Administration failed to complete its task because the waterways were not repaired well.

The ice roads in the Yichun forest region are about 500 li long. The lifespan of the ice roads is very short, but they bear the serious task of transporting timber from the mountains to the foot of the mountains. Therefore, people cherish them very much.

I walked a long way on the ice road and saw that after the sleds passed, the workers immediately cleaned the ice road. Not even a bit of manure or grass is allowed on the ice road. Every night, the workers carry lanterns, drive horse-drawn sleds, and pull large water tanks to sprinkle water on the ice road, making the tracks of the ice road more solid and smoother. They sprinkle water and sweep the ice road day and night. Neither violent winds nor heavy snow can stop their work.

Such a long and wide ice road is not easy to build. I have seen the construction of ice roads in several areas.

One moonlit night, I followed several night-shift workers repairing the ice road southward for more than ten li. When we had walked five or six li on the ice road, the worker named Wang Tingjin (who was still a farmer last year) suddenly stopped. He raised his iron shovel and shoveled a few times at an ice pile next to the ice road, and said to me: "This is a 'water diversion,' we rely on this trick to complete our task." It turns out that "water diversion" is a major creation of the workers in last year's campaign to find tricks. This creation reduced the hard labor of pulling water and carrying ice blocks when workers were building ice roads, and made it possible to use very little manpower to change the course of the water in nearby small rivers to flow to the route of the ice road. The use of "water diversion" to build ice roads has been widely promoted in the Yichun forest region.

It is certainly not easy to make the water from a low-lying area flow to a high-lying ice road. The completion of this "water diversion" that appeared before my eyes had caused Wang Tingjin and his colleagues to suffer three failures. On the coldest days, they opened up a meter-thick ice, and then stood in the ice water to drive piles, lay grass, and plug the gaps in order to divert the small river. When the small river was diverted for the third time, Wang Tingjin bared his arms and reached into the ice hole to plug the gaps with grass. Cold water froze into ice blocks in their shoes and socks. They used such hard work to make the water flowing under the ice flow onto the ice, make the water flowing from a low-lying area flow to a high-lying area, and make the small river change its original course.

It is impossible to let the water flow down naturally. The severe cold causes the water to freeze again in a very short time. Therefore, the people who build the ice road have to go back and forth to break and retrieve ice. This more than ten-li-long ice road has to be broken and retrieved four times a night to prevent the water flow from freezing to death.

Not far from the ice road, there are many wells. These wells are not specially for the people in the forest region to drink water, but for watering the ice road.

In summer and autumn, there are streams everywhere in the forest region. In winter, many rivers dry up. Therefore, in many places, watering the ice road has to rely on wells. Digging wells is mostly not done in summer or autumn, because wells dug in summer and autumn dry up in winter.

Next to a Manchurian oak tree, I saw the people digging a well for building the ice road. A lively young man was digging mud and drawing water in the well, and his hair was covered with ice. The person on the well asked him: "Jie Shijia, are you cold?" He said: "I'm not cold, I'm still hot!" Others wanted to go down to replace him, but he firmly refused to change shifts. He said that even if it was difficult, it was not as difficult as the front lines in Korea! This twenty-one-year-old Communist Youth League member once told me about his work in the well. He said: "At that time, I only thought that if the well was not dug well, the task of watering the ice road could not be completed, and if the ice road was not watered well, the timber could not be transported down. How can our country carry out construction if the timber cannot be transported down?" The ice roads in the Yichun forest region were created through such hard work.

	Tractor Drivers and Heroes of the Hudu River

In mid-November last year, I visited the Mechanization Branch of the Yichun Forest Region Administration—the Shuangzi River Branch. The task of the tractors in the forest is not to plant and harvest, but to transport timber. Day and night, it is filled with the roar of tractors, showing an atmosphere of intense labor.

One evening at eight o'clock, tractor team leader Ma Zhongxiao led me into a workshop where tractor drivers and soldiers lived together. At this time, the landing (i.e., the place where the timber is parked) and the dense forest were still radiating the light of the electric lights on the tractors. Ma Zhongxiao said: "It was long overdue to stop work, but the workers just won't go down the mountain. In the Lesser Khingan Mountains, the sun sets after 3 pm, and the tractor drivers insist on working in the dark for more than four hours. In the morning, some of them get up at 3 am to start the machines. Once the machine of this car is started, others can't hold back. The superiors stipulate that they can only work ten hours a day, but the workers and soldiers insist on working twelve to sixteen hours."

The tractor drivers and soldiers who have just come to the forest region are very serious and hardworking about the tasks assigned to them by the country. They had already finished work several hours late, but after returning to the garage, they did not rest or eat, and immediately inspected and repaired the locomotives. The tractor drivers explained in detail to the soldiers how to drive. They did not seem to know fatigue. After returning to the workshop, they ate, and then started playing the huqin and harmonica.

In Ma Zhongxiao's team, there is a tractor driver who always pulls the most and goes the farthest. His name is Guan Shixiang, and he is a tractor team leader. He leads three tractors to pull timber on mountain ridges that have to climb more than seven li. The superiors stipulate that each machine has to pull 32 cubic meters per day, but each of their machines has reached 40 cubic meters per day. When he pulls timber from nearby, he sometimes reaches 70 or 80 or even 100 cubic meters. Guan Shixiang is a Communist Party member, and the superiors often give him the most difficult tasks. A thin, tall soldier sitting on Guan Shixiang's bed said: "Comrade Guan Shixiang is very united with the soldiers. Every day when the tractor returns to the garage, he always teaches us again and again. Now we have learned almost everything." Guan Shixiang pointed to the thin soldier and said: "Comrade Zhao Shenghe is a hero of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion!" Indeed, he is one of the heroes from the Hudu River. In the tense labor of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion project, they all lost more than ten to twenty pounds of weight. The titles of heroes and models are not easy to obtain, but there are more than 780 of them in this regiment. During our conversation, Zhao Shenghe clearly recited Chairman Mao's order during the Jingjiang Flood Diversion. He said that the superiors have assigned us the task of logging the forest, and we must guarantee to learn the technology and complete the task. He familiarly recited their three guarantees: study well, unite well, and complete the production task well.

The heroes of the Hudu River brought their good style to the tractor drivers, changing the past bad habits of those who did not work hard.

	Farmers Support the Forest Region

When winter comes, farmers from Fujin, Huachuan, Bayan, Hulan, Lalin, Boli and other counties in Songjiang Province drive fat horses in groups to support the construction site in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. Their task is arduous. The entire timber collection work in the Yichun forest region, except for the Shuangzi River Branch, is mostly borne by them. In addition, they are also responsible for transporting timber and watering ice roads. Without their support for the Yichun forest region, it would be difficult for the Yichun forest region to complete its timber production task. Like other workers in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, they have to operate the most intensive labor in the coldest three months.

One morning, I walked into a warm work shed. The blazing flames in the stove were burning, and there was boiling water and soybean cakes for feeding livestock on the stove. People were concentrating on listening to a young man speaking. The young man said: "There are six large stoves in our work shed, we must be careful to prevent fires, otherwise, if a fire breaks out, these two doors will be difficult to walk out of." Speaking of transporting timber, he said: "We must ensure that there are no accidents." He strictly criticized those who whipped their horses desperately, saying: "We must take care of the horses, don't beat them randomly, and train them well." This young man is the team leader of this work team, Li Liancheng. He used to be a gunner in the Fourth Field Army. He participated in the battles of Sipingjie, Jinzhou, Tianjin, and Taiyuan, and later marched south to Changsha. During the Taiyuan battle, he destroyed nine bunkers with twelve shells. Later, he was wounded and returned home in accordance with the order of the superiors. Now he serves as a member of the Chinese Communist Party branch and deputy village chief in the village. Two years ago, he responded to the Party's call and led Matangzi (a local term for a team with horses) to support the forest region. Last year, in accordance with the opinion of the superiors, he led Matangzi to the forest region again. Last year, the superiors assigned them a task of 11,000 cubic meters, and they completed 12,000 cubic meters. He said that this year's task is even less of a problem. In the logging yard, a person drove a horse-drawn sled, pulling heavy red pines, walking out of the rugged and narrow road, and behind him were several other horse-drawn sleds. Li Liancheng pointed to him and said: "This is Lin Guangfu from Toulin Village." More than forty horses came from their village. Lin Guangfu said to me that now the people listen to the government the most. When the government called for increased production, a high-yield village appeared in their village. The high-yield village harvested an average of more than five shi per hectare (each shi is more than 600 jin to 700 jin), and some harvested more than 1,000 jin of sorghum per mu. He said: "This time the government called us to pull timber. As soon as the letter came, some bought horses, and some rushed to thresh the grain and deliver public grain, preparing to come to the forest region early." Li Liancheng, Lin Guangfu and other farmers who talked to me all said: "The task of transporting timber is more important than planting a few acres of land. The country is building, and can it be done without such timber!" Their many words cannot be separated from the country, because the construction of the country means their own beautiful hope.

	The Old Man in the Ice River

In a blizzard, a seventy-six-year-old man is walking in the ice river. Long icicles are hanging from his two-inch-long silver-white beard. He is carrying a crutch in his hand, and sometimes he slips on the ice road, gets up by himself and continues to walk forward. He is going to the Wolong River Dam to direct the workers there to repair the dam. According to the weather, this is the final and most intense stage of repairing the dam.

Most of the timber production task in the Yichun forest region has to rely on river water to transport it down. If the dam is not repaired, the felled timber can only lie in the deep mountains and rot. Timber floating is carried out in spring and summer, but the preparation work for timber floating—repairing the dam, clearing the river, etc.—must be done in winter or before winter.

This old man's name is Jiang Changan. Thirty years of life in the forest region has accumulated rich floating experience for him. Repairing a floating dam is not an easy task. The flow rate, flow velocity, and how much timber and stone are needed must all be carefully calculated. However, Jiang Changan has rich experience in this complex engineering. The newly established Dafeng Branch wants to repair eleven dams in order to complete the floating task of 180,000 cubic meters. This important task has to rely on Jiang Changan's help in many aspects. Although Jiang Changan does not work in the Dafeng Branch, he cares about the Dafeng Branch as much as he cares about the Wudaoku Branch. He often arranges his own branch's work and then goes to other branches to take a look. The workers fighting in the ice and snow jump up to welcome him as soon as they see old man Jiang coming. He not only tries his best to impart his skills to cadres and workers, but also personally works with the workers. Also in a winter, the Wumin River Branch wanted to repair six dams, and the director of the branch handed over this work to Jiang Changan. At that time, there was no dynamite. He said that if there was no dynamite, use a hammer. Stones were needed to repair the dam, but there were no stones nearby. They opened the ice and retrieved stones from the river. Straw bags were needed to repair the dam, but there were no straw bags. He led the workers to the forest to cut dry grass and solved this problem. The ice froze the project they were going to repair, and they used fire to thaw it. If anyone mentioned the word "difficult" to this old man, he would immediately bounce it back at you. He said to the workers in the snowy weather: "If we can't do this little work, how are the comrades on the front lines fighting!" This old man said to me: "The country is really too good! When I got on the train, the comrades supported me. The minister walked with me and helped me. I have been in the forest region for so many years, and I have never seen the workers live in a good house. Now we have built so many buildings in the forest region, we are gradually getting better and better. As long as I can crawl, I will work for the country."

In recent years, under his guidance, thirty-eight large dams have been repaired (each dam requires three to four thousand workers). Because of his contribution to the country, the workers and cadres respect and love him.

In July last year, the Yichun Administration wanted to send labor models to Harbin for recuperation. At that time, the director of the branch also mobilized old man Jiang to go to Harbin. Old man Jiang said: "It's almost time to repair the dam. I'm not going." The director of the branch repeatedly mobilized him, saying, "You can come back when it's time to repair the dam." He went to Harbin, and asked to come back after a few days. He said, "What is this! Just rest and don't work." The staff didn't let him go, but he still asked to go again and again. In the first few days of his arrival in Harbin, his weight increased, but later he couldn't eat during the day or sleep at night, and his weight slowly decreased again. He sneaked back after all. There are more than 100 li of ice river in the territory of the Wudaoku Branch. He always goes to check the river course cleaning and dam construction every few days. He and the workers are working hard for the floating work next year. Severe cold and ice and snow cannot threaten them.

	The Sowers

The sowers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains have not stopped their work in the severe winter.

In the middle of the night, on the warm kang, Sun Zhiqi's wife patted him and said: "Get up and go to work! If you go a little earlier, everyone will have to do a lot of work." They have to finish eating before dawn and walk to the logging site seven or eight li away from their residence. Their task is to clean up the forest farm in the area where logging has been carried out, preparing for sowing and transplanting trees.

Because the forest farm is too far from home, lunch has to be eaten outside. They are afraid that the steamed buns will freeze, so they bury them in the snow. When they are thirsty, they open the ice eye and drink a few mouthfuls of clear spring water. I walked seven or eight li with Sun Zhiqi and arrived at the top of Nanshan. A large number of timber felled last year were abandoned here. Without the work of cleaning up the forest farm, these timber would have been abandoned on the top of the mountain. Sun Zhiqi pointed to these timber and said: "This year, we have not only completed the task of transplanting 150,000 seedlings and sowing 180,000 holes, but also cleaned up 3,000 cubic meters of timber, completing the task of increasing production and saving 900 million yuan for the country." This honest forestry worker said: "If the forest farm is not cleaned up, the area of natural seeding cannot be expanded, and it is easy to cause diseases and insect pests in the mountain forest."

Sun Zhiqi is the site worker of the Xiying Nursing Station. He travels through the mountain farm from morning to night, directing the workers to clean up the forest farm. The branches and twigs of the felled trees are arranged in the forest in piles in an orderly manner, which creates good conditions for natural seeding. However, there were great difficulties in the initial stages of the nurturing and renewal work. The workers had no experience in planting trees and cleaning up the forest farm. Many people thought that the branches would rot whether they were cleaned up or not. No one cared about it in the past, and the trees in the forest grew so dense and so large, so why bother now? When transplanting trees, everyone said that red pines cannot be transplanted alive. After many educations, the workers slowly realized the importance of this work and became interested in this nurturing and renewal work. In order to prevent the seeds from being eaten by squirrels, they carefully guarded the sowing place day and night, using the method of knocking gongs and shouting to scare the squirrels, just like the farmers in North China scare the crows when planting peanuts. They also adopted another method for sowing, putting the bad seeds in the top layer of soil and the good seeds in the bottom layer. This method did not yield much, so they adopted the method of sowing and transplanting seedlings at the same time.

Transplanting seedlings is not easy either. They searched for red pine seedlings in the large mountain forest, and could not eat oil and vegetables for two months. There were very few tools, and the mosquitoes bit their faces swollen. However, they launched a patriotic competition, ensuring that the survival rate of the seedlings was between 80% and 98%.

The developers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains are also the nurturers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. In addition to logging trees, they also collected a large number of red pine seeds. In just one small operation, they collected more than 17,000 jin. Many workers broke open the snow next to the felled trees, split the hard soil, buried pine seeds on the spot, and then covered them with snow to prevent squirrels from stealing them. Sun Zhiqi led me to patrol the logged forest farm. The deep white snow revealed the emerald green little red pines. Sun Zhiqi looked at the little red pines that they had planted by hand, touched them, smiled, and cared for them like his own children. The sowers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains care for and nurture the forests of the motherland in this way.

    小兴安岭的冬天
    勇进
    十月底，北京的公园里的菊花刚刚开放，小兴安岭林区已经飞舞着鹅毛般的雪花了。冬天，小兴安岭林区的劳动人民并未坐在暖和的房屋里，他们走到冰雪中，采伐、运送和播种。他们喜欢冬天，喜欢冰雪。因为他们知道，要想建设美好的祖国，必须以最大的精力完成生产大批木材的任务。而冬天，是他们完成这种任务的决定性的季节。
        在庙岭伐区
    天不明，空中飘着雪花。采伐的人们背着锯、斧到山场上去。从住地到山场采伐的地方，要走好几里路，要跳过很多锯倒的树木和崎岖不平的岩石。没有到过山场的人们，是不能体会这段路程的艰巨的。
    但是，生活在庙岭伐区的人们是兴奋的。你可以在森林中时常听到路上的人吹着嘹亮的口哨，年青小伙子们愉快地唱着情歌：劝丈夫上山去采伐，伐下大木建设新国家。丈夫你去吧，平地还好走，就怕山洼洼；丈夫呀！小心脚底下。分房又分地，吃的穿的都有余，丈夫呀！别忘毛主席。
    他们说说笑笑地走到采伐的山场上了。
    组长戴阁连看着那高大的红松说：还是这林相（即森林的相貌）来劲呀！他们放下斧、锯，用几分钟的时间开了个树下会，工作就开始了。
    戴阁连和苏贵生伐树。其他几个人吊卯（使锯倒的树木易于搬运）通道。在那稠密的红松林里，戴阁连和苏贵生挑了一棵标准的松树，在它的周围两公尺内打扫得干干净净。戴阁连说：我们从来没有发生过事故哩！和他一块拉锯的苏贵生接上去说：别说发生事故啦，我们手上连个刺也没扎过呀！他们在严寒的冬天里，脱下了上身的棉衣，有的人摘掉了皮帽，头上滚着汗珠，跪在深雪里贴着地皮拉锯。他们尽力争取把伐根降低，以便不超过规定的二十公分。事实上由于他们的艰苦努力，从过去站着锯，到现在跪下锯，已经使伐根降低到零公分了。雪愈下愈大，但落在他们身上的雪马上就溶化了。
    他们愈锯愈紧张，锯到快要倒的时候，戴阁连亮着嗓子喊了几声“下山倒”，同时，告诉苏贵生在树倒时应该去的安全的地方。他们又紧张地锯了一会，又喊了几声“下山倒”。这是伐木人采伐时的严格规定，这是告诉所有的人们不许进入这棵树要倒的地方。在他最后呼喊“下山倒”的声音里，那棵高达三十公尺的红松向山的下坡倒下去了，既没有伤害母树，也没有伤害幼树。这就是老戴的本事。这几年来老戴使不少的新工人很快地学会了采伐的技术。锯危险的树，他总叫新工人在安全的地方。他们组里不仅没有伤亡事故，连公家的一件工具也没有损坏过。
    他们锯倒了第一棵树后，又把这棵树上的疙瘩皮用斧子砍去。因为不砍树疙瘩皮就容易使树木发生病虫害。他们对祖国的森林就是这样关心的。
    戴阁连小组是庙岭第四工队的骨干小组。第四工队将在一九五三年完成采伐七万立方公尺的任务。这仅仅是伊春林区的一个小小的作业所。在整个伊春林区，这个作业所在完成任务上自然不是最慢的，但也不能说是最快的。戴阁连说，他们没有更早地提前完成任务的原因，主要是过去很长一个时期缺乏工具。全工队百分之四十的人没有工具，粮食、蔬菜也运不上来。六十多个工人，四十个是新来的，最初每人每日只能采伐三立方公尺，现在每人每天可采伐四到五立方公尺了。
    不到两个钟头的时候，他们两个人伐倒了五棵树。在过去，人们总是将树木随便伐倒又随便截断。现在他们响应上级实行合理造材的指示，尽量把一等材造成特等材，把二等材造成一等材，把扔掉的树木造成三等材。戴阁连在锯树梢的时候，还说：这样的材料在过去早就扔掉了，其实运到矿山当矿柱有多好呀！木材仅次于钢铁，没有大量的木材，就没法建设我们的新国家。他们在锯完树木的时候，把松塔仔细地拾起来，他说他们小组今年已经拾到一万三千个。他在休息的时候，坐在锯倒的树干上，张开了笑脸，说出他不久前曾经向党支部表示的愿望。他说在党的领导下，他愿终身在森林里工作。
        冰道
    冬天，在伊春林区有一种奇特而美观的道路，被当地的人们叫做冰道。拖拉机和马爬犁运送木材，都要靠这种冰道，才能拉多跑快。如果不修好冰道，在目前的条件下，伊春林区是很难完成运送任务的。在一九五○年，伊春管理局的五道库分局曾因水道没有修好而未能完成任务。
    伊春林区的冰道大约有五百里长。冰道的寿命很短，但要担负着把山上的木材运到山下的严重任务。因此人们也就十分爱护它。
    我在冰道上走了很远的路程，看见爬犁过后，工人们立刻把冰道打扫一番。冰道上连一点粪、草也不许有。每天夜里，工人都提着灯笼，赶着马爬犁，拉着大水箱，在冰道上洒水，使冰道的道辙更坚固更光滑。他们日日夜夜地在冰道上洒水、打扫。狂风大雪也不能使他们的工作停息。
    这样远、这样阔的冰道，是不容易修成的。我曾经在若干地区看见了修筑冰道的情形。
    在一个月夜里，我随几个修冰道的夜班工人沿冰道南行十数里。在冰道上走了五、六里路的时候，那个名叫王廷金的工人（去年还是个农民）突然不走了。他举起铁锨在冰道旁的一个冰堆上铲了几下，对我说：这是“水别”，我们完成任务全靠这个窍门。原来“水别”是去年找窍门运动中工人的一个大创造，这个创造使工人在修冰道时减少了拉水、扛冰块的艰苦劳动，用很少的人力就可使附近小河里的水，改变道路，流到冰道的路线上来。利用“水别”修筑冰道，在伊春林区已普遍推广了。
    使低处的水流向高处的冰道，当然是不容易的。出现在我眼前的这个“水别”的修成，曾经使王廷金他们遭受了三次失败。在最严寒的日子里，他们打开一公尺厚的冰，然后站在冰水里打桩、铺草、堵缝，以便使小河改流。当第三次使小河改流的时候，王廷金曾赤着胳膊伸进冰窟窿里用草堵缝。冷水在他们的鞋袜里冻成了冰块。他们就用这样的艰苦工作，使冰下的流水流到冰上来，使低处的流水流向高处，使小河改变了它原来的道路。
    让水自然地流下去，是不可能的。严寒使水流在很短的时间里就又冻上了。因此修冰道的人们要来来回回地打冰捞冰，这十多里的冰道一夜要来回打捞四次，才不至把水流冻死。
    在离冰道不远的地方，有很多的井。这些井并不是专门供林区的人们吃水用的，而是为了浇冰道用的。
    在夏天和秋天，林区到处是水流，到了冬天，很多河流都干涸了。因此有很多地方浇冰道就要靠井。挖井多不在夏天或秋天，因为夏天秋天挖的井，一到冬天就要干涸。
    在一棵柞树旁，我看到为修冰道而挖井的人们。一个活泼的青年人在井里挖泥打水，他的头发上结了冰块。井上的人问他：解士家你冷吗？他说：不冷，还热呢！别人要下去替换他，他坚决拒绝换班，他说，再艰苦也没有朝鲜前线艰苦呀！这个二十一岁的青年团员曾经告诉我他在井底下工作的情形。他说：当时只想到井挖不好就不能完成浇好冰道的任务，而冰道浇不好，木材就运不下来。运不下木材，我们的国家怎样进行建设呢？伊春林区的冰道，就是用这样艰苦的工作造成的。
    拖拉机手和虎渡河的英雄
    去年十一月中旬，我访问了伊春林区管理局的机械化分局——双子河分局。拖拉机在森林里的任务不是播种与收割，而是搬运木材。日日夜夜，这里充满了拖拉机的吼叫声，显示出紧张劳动的气氛。
    一天晚上八点钟的时候，拖拉机队长马忠孝领着我进入一个拖拉机手和战士们在一起合住的工房里。这时?场（即停放木材的地方）上和密林里还在放射着拖拉机上的电灯的光芒。马忠孝说：早就该收工了，工人就是不下山。在小兴安岭，太阳下午三点多钟就落山了，拖拉机手硬要摸四个多钟头的黑。早晨，他们有的三点钟就爬起来发动机器。这个车的机器一发动，别的人也就沉不住气了。上级规定他们每天只能做十个钟头的工，但工人和战士们偏偏要做十二个到十六个钟头。”
    拖拉机手和初来林区的战士们，对于国家交给他们的任务，是很认真努力的。他们收工已经晚了几个钟头，但在回到车库以后，还不休息吃饭，又马上检修机车。拖拉机手详细地给战士讲解如何开车，他们似乎不知道疲倦，回到工房里，吃吃饭，又拉起胡琴，吹起口琴来了。
    在马忠孝这个工队里有个拖拉机手，他每次都拉得最多，走得最远。他叫关世祥，是个拖拉机小组长。他率领三台拖拉机，在要爬过七里多路的山岗上拉木头。上级规定每台机器每天要拉三十二立方公尺，他们每台机器每天已达到四十立方公尺。他拉近处木材的时候，有时候达到七、八十直到一百立方公尺。关世祥是个共产党员，上级常常把最艰难的任务交给他。坐在关世祥床上的一个瘦瘦的高个子战士说：“关世祥同志和战士团结得可好了，每天拖拉机回库的时候，他总是一遍又一遍地教我们，现在我们已经学得差不多了。”关世祥指着那个瘦瘦的战士说：赵生和同志是荆江分洪的功臣！真的，他是来自虎渡河上的英雄之一。他们在荆江分洪工程的紧张劳动中，体重都减轻了十几斤到二十几斤。功臣和英雄的头衔是不容易获得的，但他们这一个团里就有七百八十多个。我们谈话时，赵生和清楚地背诵了荆江分洪时毛主席的命令。他说，上级把采伐森林的任务交给我们，我们一定保证学好技术，完成任务。他熟悉地背诵了他们的三项保证：学习好，团结好，完成生产任务好。
    虎渡河上的英雄们把自己良好的作风带给拖拉机手，使那些不好好工作的人改变了过去的不良作风。
    农民支援林区
    冬天来了，松江省富锦、桦川、巴彦、呼兰、拉林、勃利等县的农民，赶着肥壮的马，成群结队地来支援小兴安岭工地。他们的任务是艰巨的。整个伊春林区的集材工作，除了双子河分局外，绝大部分都要他们担负。此外，他们还担负着运材和浇冰道等任务。没有他们来支援伊春林区，伊春林区的木材生产任务是难以完成的。他们和小兴安岭的其他劳动者一样，要在最严寒的三个月里操作最紧张的劳动。
    一天的早晨，我走进一个暖和的工棚里。火炉里熊熊的火焰在燃烧着，炉上放着开水和喂牲口的豆饼。人们在集中精力听一个青年人讲话。这个青年人说：我们工棚里有六个大火炉，我们一定要好好防火，不然发生火灾，这两个门就很难走出去。讲到运木材，他说：我们一定要保证不出事故。他严格地指责那些拚命打马的人说：我们要爱护马，对马不要乱打，要好好地训练它们。这个青年人就是这个工队的工队长李连成。他过去是第四野战军的
    一个炮手，他参加了四平街、锦州、天津、太原等战役，后来又南征到长沙。太原战役时他以十二发炮弹摧毁了九个堡垒。后来他负伤了，遵照上级的命令复员回家。现在他在村里担任中共支部委员和副村长。前年他响应党的号召，带领马套子支援林区。去年他遵照上级的意见，又带领马套子来到林区。去年上级分配给他们一万一千立方公尺的任务，他们完成了一万二千立方公尺。他说，今年的任务更不成问题。在楞场上，一个人赶着马爬犁，拉着沉重的红松，从崎岖狭窄的道路上走出来，他的后面又是几付马爬犁。李连成指着他说：这就是头林村的林广福。他们村里来了四十多匹马。林广福对我说，现在老百姓最听政府的话，政府号召丰产，他们村上就出现了丰产屯；丰产屯每垧地平均收获五石多（每石六百多斤到七百斤），有的每亩收高粱一千多斤。他说：这次政府号召我们来拉木头，信一传来，有的买马，有的赶早打场送公粮，准备早来林区。和我谈话的李连成、林广福以及其他的农民都说：运木头的任务比种几亩地还重要；国家大建设哩，离了这样的木材还行呀！他们的很多话里离不开国家，因为国家的建设，就是意味着自己的美好的希望。
        冰河中的老人
    暴风雪里，一个七十六岁的老人在冰河里行走。他那两寸长的银白色的胡须上结了长长的冰柱，他手里提着拐杖，有时滑倒在冰路上，自己爬起来又继续往前走。他要到卧龙河大水闸上去，指挥那里的工人们修理水闸。按天气来说，这已是修理水闸的最后最紧张的阶段了。
    伊春林区的木材生产任务，大部是要靠河水流送下去的。如果不把水闸修好，采伐的木材只能躺在深山里烂掉。流送木材是在春天和夏天进行，但流送木材的准备工作——修水闸、清理河道等等，一定要在冬季或冬季以前作好。
    这个老人叫姜长安。三十年的林区生活，使他积累了丰富的流送经验。修一个流送水闸，并不是一件容易的事。流量、流速以及需要多少木材、石头，都要作周密的计算。但姜长安对这种复杂的工程，具有丰富的经验。今年才成立的大丰分局要修十一道水闸，以便完成十八万立方公尺的流送任务。这个重大任务，在许多方面要依靠姜长安的帮助。姜长安虽然不在大丰分局工作，但他关心大丰分局像关心五道库分局一样，往往把自己分局的工作安排好了，就到别的分局看看。那些在冰雪里战斗的工人们，一见姜老头来了，就跳起来欢迎他，他不但尽量地把自己的技术传授给干部和工人，还亲自下手和工人们在一块儿工作。也是一个冬天，乌敏河分局要修六道水闸，局长把这件工作交给了姜长安。那时要炸药没有炸药，他说没炸药用铁锤打。修水闸要用石头，但附近没有石头，他们打开冰，从河里捞石头。修水闸要用草袋子，但没有草袋子，他领着工人到树林里割干草，解决了这个问题。冰把他们要修的工程冻住了，他们用火烤开。如果谁向这个老人提个“难”字，他马上会给你碰回来。他在雪天里向工人们说：我们这点活还干不了，前线的同志怎样打仗呀！这位老人对我说：国家实在太好啦！我上火车时同志们架着我，部长和我一块走路还扶着我，我在林区多少年，没见工人住过一座好房子；现在我们在林区里修了这样多的大楼，我们一步步地过好了，我只要能爬动，就要为国家工作。
    几年来，在他指导之下，修好了三十八个大水闸
    （每个水闸要用三四千个工）。由于他对国家的贡献，工人和干部都尊敬他，爱戴他。
    去年七月间，伊春管理局要送劳动模范去哈尔滨休养，当时分局长也动员姜老头去哈尔滨去。姜老头说：快到修水闸的时候了。我不去。分局长再三地动员他，说，到修水闸的时候就可以回来了。他到了哈尔滨，没几天就要求回来。他说，这算什么呀！光休息不工作。工作人员不让他走，他还是三番两次地要求走。他到哈尔滨的开始几天，体重增加了，后来他白天吃不下饭，晚上睡不着觉，体重又慢慢地减轻了。他毕竟偷偷地溜回来了。五道库分局境内有一百多里的冰河，他隔不了几天，总会去检查河道的清理和水闸修建的情形。他和工人们在一起为来年的流送工作而努力，严寒与冰雪是不能威胁他们的。
    播种者
    小兴安岭的播种者，在严寒的冬天并没有停止自己的工作。
    天才半夜，在暖和的炕上，孙志起的妻子拍着他说：起来上工吧！你一个人早去一点，大家就要做很多工作。他们要在天明前吃完饭，并且走到离住地七八里路的山场上。他们的任务是到采伐过的地方清理林场，准备播种和移植树木。
    因为林场离家太远，中午饭只得在外面吃。他们怕馒头冻了，就埋在雪里。他们渴了，就打开冰眼，喝几口清泉。我和孙志起走了七八里路，到了南山顶。这里遗弃着大批去年采伐的木材。如果没有清理林场的工作，这些木材就被抛在山顶上了。孙志起指着这些木材说：我们今年不但完成了移苗十五万株、播种十八万穴的任务，还清理了三千立方公尺木材，完成给国家增产节约九亿元的任务。这个老实的林业工人说：不清理林场就不能扩大天然下种的面积，又容易使山林发生病虫害。
    孙志起是西营抚育站的现场员，他从早到晚地穿行在山场里，指挥工人清理林场。被伐倒的树木的枝桠一堆一堆地有秩序地安排在树林里，这给天然下种造成良好的条件。可是，抚育更新的工作，在最初是有很大困难的。工人们对种树、清理林场的工作还没有经验，很多人认为树枝清理也是烂，不清理也是烂；过去没人管，森林的树木也长得这样稠这样大，现在何必费事呢？移树时，大家又说，红松移不活。经过多次的教育，工人慢慢地认识了这个工作的重要性，对这抚育更新的工作发生了兴趣。为了防止种籽被松鼠吃掉，他们白天夜里在播种的地方小心看守，用敲锣叫喊的办法来惊吓松鼠，像华北的农民在种花生时惊吓老鸦一样。他们还采取另一种办法进行播种，把坏种籽放在上面一层土里，而把好种籽放在最下层。这样的办法收获也不大，他们又采取了播种与移苗同时进行的办法。
    移苗也是不容易的。他们在大山林里寻找红松幼苗，曾经两个月吃不上油和菜，工具很少、蚊子把他们的脸都咬肿了。但他们开展了爱国主义竞赛，保证了幼树的成活率在百分之八十到百分之九十八。
    小兴安岭的开采者，也是小兴安岭的抚育者，他们除了采伐树木以外，还采集了大量的红松种籽，仅一个小小的作业所里，就收集了一万七千多斤。很多工人们在伐倒的树木旁边，扒开雪，劈开坚硬的土地，就地埋上松籽，然后再用雪盖上，以免松鼠偷食。孙志起领着我在伐过的林场上巡行，那深厚的白雪里露着翠绿的小红松，孙志起看着他们亲手栽活的小红松，摸一摸，笑一笑，像对他的亲生子女一样地关心。小兴安岭的播种者们，就是这样来关心着祖国的森林，抚育森林的。
