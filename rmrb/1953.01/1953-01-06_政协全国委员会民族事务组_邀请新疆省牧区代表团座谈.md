Xinhua News Agency Report: The Nationalities Affairs Group of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee invited the Xinjiang Province Pastoral Area Visiting Delegation to a discussion meeting on December 29th of last year. The meeting was presided over by Zhu Zaoguan, head of the Nationalities Affairs Group of the CPPCC National Committee, and Gan Chunlei, deputy head. At the meeting, the head of the Xinjiang Province Pastoral Area Visiting Delegation, Batihan (Kazak nationality), reported on the delegation's gains from visiting the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places, as well as the warm and cordial welcome and reception they received from the people of all ethnic groups in various locations. The deputy head, Ge Erxia (Mongolian nationality), introduced the production and living conditions of the herdsmen in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang. Batihan used vivid and specific examples to illustrate the new atmosphere of prosperity for both people and livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the greatness and loveliness of the motherland.

The Xinjiang Province Pastoral Area Visiting Delegation included representatives of thirteen ethnic groups from various pastoral areas in Xinjiang, including pastoral owners, pastoral workers, and ordinary herdsmen, as well as cadres of various ethnic groups working in the pastoral areas. The delegation visited Gui Sui city, where the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is located, and factories, schools, and advanced rural areas in Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places, before arriving in Beijing on December 18th of last year. They gained a deep understanding and appreciation of the policies implemented by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the pastoral areas, such as not conducting struggles or land redistribution, not classifying class components, ensuring mutual benefit for pastoral workers and owners in labor-capital relations, implementing free grazing, mutual aid in labor, and settled nomadism among herdsmen, as well as various specific measures to promote the prosperity of both people and livestock. They unanimously agreed that the rapid increase in the number of various livestock and the general improvement in the economic life of herdsmen in the five years since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were the result of the correct implementation of the ethnic and production policies of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.

    邀请新疆省牧区代表团座谈
    据新华社讯：中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会民族事务组，在去年十二月二十九日邀请新疆省牧区代表参观团举行座谈会。座谈会由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会民族事务组组长朱早观、副组长甘春雷主持。会上，新疆省牧区代表参观团团长巴提汉（哈萨克族）报告了该团这次参观内蒙古自治区牧区及天津、沈阳等地的收获，及各地各族人民热烈亲切欢迎和招待他们的情况。副团长格尔夏
    （蒙古族）介绍了新疆牧区牧民的生产与生活情况。巴提汉用生动具体的事例说明了内蒙古自治区各族人民人畜两旺的新气象，与祖国的伟大和可爱。
    新疆省牧区代表参观团，包括有新疆各个牧区的十三个民族的代表，其中有牧主、牧工和一般牧民，以及在牧区内工作的各民族干部。参观团曾前后参观了内蒙古自治区人民政府所在地的归绥市，和天津、沈阳等地的工厂、学校及先进农村，于去年十二月十八日抵北京。他们对内蒙古自治区人民政府在牧区内实行不斗不分、不划分阶级成份、牧工牧主劳资两利的政策，在牧民中实行自由放牧、劳动互助、定居游牧的生产方式，以及促进人畜两旺的各种具体措施，有了深切的体会和了解。他们并一致认为：内蒙古自治区成立后的五年当中，各种牲畜数目的飞跃增加和牧民经济生活的普遍改善，是正确执行毛主席和中央人民政府民族政策与生产政策的结果。
