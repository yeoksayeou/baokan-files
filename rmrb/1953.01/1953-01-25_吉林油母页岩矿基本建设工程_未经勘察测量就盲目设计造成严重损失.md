The basic construction project of the Jilin Oil Shale Mine last year suffered serious losses to the state due to the irresponsible behavior of the design personnel, who blindly designed without conducting prior surveying and mapping. For example, they designed the water source wells on the rocky base of a mountain corner. When the construction department received such a design, they did not raise any objections to the design department, but instead used explosives to blast open the rocks and then used concrete and stones to build up the structure (over seven meters deep), wasting more than 1,200 man-days, over 200 meters of electrical conduit, over 60 kilograms of explosives, 200 cubic meters of stone, and 33 tons of cement. The boiler room was designed on a high mountain, completely equivalent to moving the mountain by manual labor. Soviet experts said that this was like putting the cart before the horse. The project for a 500-ton water tank was designed with 30-centimeter thick concrete, plus a double layer of rebar, tied very densely. In fact, this was not necessary. In addition, problems in the design of the oil tank foundation and concrete ditch covers resulted in the waste of materials worth over 100 million yuan. Due to the lack of prior surveying and mapping, there were also many instances of rework in the design.

    吉林油母页岩矿基本建设工程
    未经勘察测量就盲目设计造成严重损失
    吉林油母页岩矿去年的基本建设工程，由于设计人员不负责任，事先没有进行勘察测量，就盲目设计，造成了很多荒谬的错误，使国家受到了严重的损失。例如他们把水源地的水井设计在山角上的石岩上。施工部门接到了这样的设计，也不向设计部门提出意见，就将岩石用炸药崩开，再用混凝土与石头砌上（约七公尺多深），浪费人工一千二百多个，电管二百多公尺，炸药六十多公斤，石头二百多立方公尺，洋灰三十三吨。锅炉房设计在高山上，完全等于用人工将山挪走。苏联专家说，这就像不先牵马套车，而是用车套马。五百吨水池子的工程，设计了三十公分厚的混凝土，加上双层铁筋，绑得又密。其实并不需要这样。此外，像油灌基础、混凝土沟盖，都因设计中有毛病，浪费了一亿元以上的材料。由于事先没勘测，设计中返工也很多。
