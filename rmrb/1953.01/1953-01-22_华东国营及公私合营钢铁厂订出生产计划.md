    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 21st: State-owned and joint state-private steel factories in East China have formulated their production plans for this year. The most significant feature of this year's plan is the implementation of the central government's requirement to strictly improve quality and reduce costs, in order to better support national economic construction. This year's output plan for East China's steel factories represents a 38% increase over last year's actual output. The proportion of special grade and premium grade steel ingots and steel products will nearly double compared to last year, and costs will also be significantly reduced.
    According to the strict requirements of this year's plan, starting from January, unqualified products cannot be included in the output figures. Additionally, substandard products cannot be counted as qualified. Last year, the Third Factory of the Shanghai Steel Company made efforts to increase the proportion of special grade and premium grade steel ingots to about 50% of all steel ingots, while reducing the proportion of second-grade products to about 40%. Further improvement was possible, but many workers believed that a slight deficiency did not matter, as second-grade products could still be considered qualified and leave the factory, making completion of the output target the priority. This year's plan compels them to quickly improve the quality of steel, otherwise they will not be able to complete the steel output target. Currently, the employees of the smelting department are working hard to improve operations and strengthen the finishing of steel ingots, transforming many second-grade products into special grade and premium grade products. At the same time, they have improved the "aluminum addition to molten steel" method, reducing air pockets in the steel ingots. As a result, in less than ten days, the factory's special grade and premium grade steel ingots rapidly increased from 50% in December last year to 80%, with the highest reaching 90%, gradually approaching the national requirement of 95% or more. The special grade and premium grade steel ingots produced by the First Factory of the Shanghai Steel Company have also increased from 50-60% to 85%, with the highest even reaching over 93%. Currently, the East China Branch of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry will lead the factories in launching a mass movement to improve quality, using methods such as learning from advanced Soviet experiences, improving technology, and strictly implementing operating procedures, to further improve quality and complete the plan.
    This year's plan also requires factories to strictly reduce costs. Recently, the East China Steel Branch Bureau is leading the factories in revising the cost plans in this year's plan. It is estimated that the average cost plan targets for the factories this year can be increased from a reduction of 2.3% compared to last year's actual costs to a reduction of about 3.8%. In meticulously calculating how to reduce costs, the First Factory of the Shanghai Steel Company decided to work hard this year to improve operations to reduce the consumption quotas for raw materials and coal. For example, the consumption of scrap steel raw materials for each ton of steel produced by open-hearth furnaces will be reduced by another 50 kilograms compared to the original plan, and coal consumption will be reduced by another 28 kilograms. Because this year's cost target is lower than last year's, the factory can save the country about 60 billion yuan this year. The Xinhu Steel Factory decided to strive to further improve the quality of cold-cast wheels by 5% to reduce costs.

### 华东国营及公私合营钢铁厂订出生产计划

    华东国营及公私合营钢铁厂订出生产计划
     【新华社上海二十一日电】华东各国营、公私合营钢铁工厂，已制订出今年的生产计划。今年计划的最大特点是贯彻了中央要求的严格提高质量、降低成本的精神，以便更好地支援国家经济建设。华东各钢铁厂今年的产量计划，比去年的实际产量增加百分之三十八，其中特级和优级的钢锭、钢材所占比重，比去年增加近一倍，成本也要降低很多。
    按照今年计划的严格规定，各厂从一月份开始，不合格的产品，不能计算入产量中去；同时，次品也不能算为合格品。上海钢铁公司第三厂在去年曾努力把特级、优级钢锭，提高到占全部钢锭的百分之五十左右，次一级品减少到百分之四十左右。本来还可以再提高，但是许多职工认为：差一点没关系，反正次一级也算合格、可以出厂，完成产量任务要紧。今年的计划迫使他们不得不赶紧提高钢的质量，否则就不能完成钢的产量任务。现在冶炼部职工努力改进操作，加强钢锭的整理工作，使许多次一级品变成了特级、优级产品；同时他们又改进了“钢水中加铝”的方法，减少了钢锭中的气孔毛病。因此，不到十天，该厂的特级、优级钢锭，就由去年十二月份的百分之五十，迅速上升到百分之八十，最高上升到百分之九十，逐渐接近到国家规定的百分之九十五以上的要求。上海钢铁公司第一厂生产的特级、优级钢锭，也由百分之五、六十，提高到百分之八十五，最高甚至已达到百分之九十三以上。目前中央重工业部钢铁工业局华东分局将领导各厂开展一个提高质量的群众性运动，用学习苏联先进经验，改进技术，严格执行操作规程的办法，来进一步提高质量，完成计划。
    今年的计划还要求各厂严格降低成本。最近，华东钢铁分局正在领导各厂修订今年计划中的成本计划，估计各厂今年的成本计划指标，平均可由原计划比去年的实际成本降低百分之二点三，增加到降低百分之三点八左右。上海钢铁公司第一厂在精细计算如何降低成本中，决定今年要努力改进操作，来降低原料和燃煤的耗损定额，如平炉每一吨钢水用的废钢原料，决定比原计划再减少五十公斤，燃煤再减少二十八公斤。由于今年成本指标比去年降低，该厂今年可为国家节约的资金约六十余亿元。新沪钢铁厂决定努力把冷铸车轮的质量再提高百分之五，来减低成本。
