    To the Editor: The situation mentioned in the opinion "The broad masses of soldiers urgently demand that publishing and distributing agencies supply a large number of popular reading materials," published in the "Reader's Letters Page" of the People's Daily on September 10, 1952, is consistent with the facts. Indeed, there are still many shortcomings in our publishing and distribution work. The Second National Publishing Administration Conference recently convened has proposed some improvement measures in this regard, and various books and periodicals will be gradually published and distributed in a planned manner in the future to meet the needs of readers in all aspects.

    The problems existing in the work of supplying popular reading materials to the troops are: on the one hand, there are not many popular reading materials published to cooperate with the rapid literacy campaign that are suitable for the broad masses of soldiers to read, and there is a large gap between them and the requirements of the broad masses of soldiers; on the other hand, there are still major problems in distribution work. In the past, the East China and North China branches of the Xinhua Bookstore established mobile bookstores in the troops to serve the soldiers. However, after the mobile bookstores were withdrawn, the distribution problem in the troops was not well resolved. Recently, the Xinhua Bookstores in Northeast China and Fujian have strengthened their ties with the troops stationed there and made some efforts; but on a national scale, it is still far from meeting the needs.

    Recently, our agency has initially consulted with the General Political Department of the Military Commission and has obtained their verbal agreement, preparing to establish a distribution network in the troops. A set of reading materials for soldiers has been selected to supply to the troops' cultural centers for purchase. As for the publication of popular reading materials, in addition to our efforts to gradually improve it in the future, we also hope that the propaganda and education departments of the troops will pay attention to solving it.

    出版总署将逐步加强部队读物的出版发行工作
    编辑同志：一九五二年九月十日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表的“广大战士迫切要求出版发行机关供给大量通俗读物”的意见中所指的情况，是符合事实的。的确我们在出版、发行工作中还存在很多缺点。最近召开的第二届全国出版行政会议对此已提出一些改进办法，今后将逐步有计划地出版和发行各种书刊，以供应各方面读者的需要。
    供应部队通俗读物的工作中存在的问题是：一方面，配合速成识字运动出版的能适合广大战士阅读的通俗读物不多，与广大战士的要求距离很远；另一方面是在发行工作上还存在很大的问题。过去新华书店华东、华北等总分店都在部队中建立随军书店，专为战士们服务。但随军书店撤销后，部队中发行问题就没有很好解决。最近东北、福建的新华书店都与驻军加强了联系，作了部分的努力；但在全国范围说来，与需要相差还很远。
    最近我署已与军委总政治部初步洽商，并已取得他们的口头同意，准备在部队中建立发行网。目前已选好士兵读物一套，供给部队文化室采购。至于通俗读物的出版问题，除我们今后努力逐步改善外，并望部队的宣教部门注意解决。  中央人民政府出版总署
