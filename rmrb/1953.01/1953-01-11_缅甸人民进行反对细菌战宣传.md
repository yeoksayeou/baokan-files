    Burmese People Conduct Anti-Bacterial Warfare Propaganda
    The Burmese government unreasonably confiscated films about opposing bacteriological warfare that were brought back by Burmese representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. However, the Burmese people, regardless of government obstruction, continue to carry out anti-bacterial warfare propaganda. The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace has printed 5,000 copies of the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war Quinn and Enock and distributed them throughout Burma. The report of the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China has also been sent to doctors throughout Burma.

    缅甸人民进行反对细菌战宣传
    缅甸政府无理地没收了出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议缅甸代表带回去的关于反对细菌战的影片。但是缅甸人民不顾政府阻挠继续进行反对细菌战的宣传。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会已将美国空军战俘奎恩和伊纳克的供词刊印五千本分发缅甸各地。调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会的报告书，也分送到了缅甸各地的医生手里。
