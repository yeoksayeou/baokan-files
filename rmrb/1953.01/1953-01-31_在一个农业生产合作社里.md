    In an Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Gu Weijin
    Last November, a heavy snow fell on the Taihang Mountains. As dusk approached in the snow-covered mountains, I arrived at Dongzhuang Village in Qin County, Shanxi Province, nestled among the mountains. It was a natural village with twenty households.
    Zhang Tuxiao led me into the village, saying as we walked:
    "Our place is remote, with high mountains and narrow roads. If it weren't for the cooperative (agricultural production cooperative), outsiders would rarely come here."
    Zhang Tuxiao is the Communist Party branch secretary of Dongzhuang Bian Village and also a member of the agricultural production cooperative. Speaking of the cooperative, he continued enthusiastically:
    "Since our cooperative was established last spring, we've had many visitors during the spring, summer, and autumn harvest appraisals: members of mutual aid teams from the whole village, representatives of mutual aid teams from various villages in the county, cadres sent by the province, the special commissioner's office, and the county government, and now you've come too. Are you planning to publish this in the newspaper?" I asked, "What did the visitors say?" He said, "Everyone said our crops were growing well. And indeed they were! All 177.6 mu of autumn land had increased production!" As we walked towards the east end of the village, Zhang Tuxiao excitedly discussed the increase in production: In 1951, within the mutual aid teams, the average yield per mu of autumn land was 329.6 jin. In 1952, after the agricultural production cooperative was established, the average yield per mu of autumn land was 415.38 jin, an increase of 85.78 jin compared to 1951. This exceeded the village's average yield in 1952 by 62 percent, exceeded the average yield of the best mutual aid team in the village by 48 percent, and exceeded the average yield of the best individual farmer in the village by 149 percent. For all twenty households in the cooperative, based on the 1951 grain harvest, five households increased grain production by 15 to 20 shi in 1952, five households increased by 10 to 15 shi, four households increased by 7 to 10 shi, and six households increased by 5 to 7 shi (income from private plots not included). Adding the surplus grain accumulated in the mutual aid teams in 1951, each household now has an average surplus of about 14 or 15 shi to 20 shi.
    At this time, the village was quiet, and many houses were already locked up. I asked Zhang Tuxiao, "The mountains and fields are covered in snow, where have the villagers gone?" An old man nearby replied, "They've all gone to Qi Village to attend the material exchange fair."
    In the evening, I stayed at Li Tongsuo's home. He had bought large floral blankets, gray serge fabric, and cigarettes, etc., at the material exchange fair. Li Tongsuo said that at the material exchange fair, each member of their cooperative had bought daily necessities worth several tens of thousands of yuan, and he himself had already bought more than one hundred thousand yuan worth of daily necessities.
    Under the lamplight, Li Tongsuo repeatedly admired his newly bought floral blanket. Suddenly, he happily said, "If we hadn't established the land cooperative, how could our lives have become like this?" I asked, "What was your life like before?" He said, "I used to do odd jobs, gamble, smoke opium, and steal things. But since the land reform and the distribution of land, and after joining the mutual aid team, I've lived a life with plenty to eat and wear. This year, after joining the land cooperative, life has become even better. I personally received 20 shi of grain, and after deducting what we eat and wear, I can save more than 10 shi."

                ×    ×    ×

    The next day, I visited many members of the agricultural production cooperative. Knowing that I was from Beijing, the members enthusiastically inquired about Chairman Mao's recent situation, the construction of the capital, and the Korean War. Afterwards, I talked with the members about the bumper harvest of the agricultural production cooperative in 1952 and the lives of the members. They all connected these achievements with the branch secretary Zhang Tuxiao, the branch committee member Li Furong (the director of the cooperative), and Li Xinghai (the production team leader and village head). They said that these outstanding Communist Party members led them to continue to advance on the basis of organization, which is why they have such good times today.
    That day, I was assigned to eat at the home of Li Fuhe, the deputy leader of the production team. Li Fuhe talked to me about this problem: When the idea of establishing the cooperative was first being considered, many people had the idea that "production had reached its limit" and did not advocate establishing the cooperative. "What was the matter?" Li Fuhe said:
    "Our village has twenty households. Since 1942, we have organized mutual aid teams, and we have been helping each other until 1951. During these ten years, especially after the land reform five years ago, each household was allocated land and livestock, and the mutual aid teams emphasized farming techniques, so production developed very quickly. Before the war, each mu of land yielded an average of nine dou of grain. Now, each mu of land yields an average of one shi and six dou. Each household has a surplus of grain every year. The life of 'half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain' before the war has become a life where we have enough to eat and wear. At this time, many people felt that this was what being organized was all about, and there would be no greater prospects. But the higher authorities called on us to further organize and try out land cooperatives. Many people couldn't understand this idea." Li Fuhe stopped talking here. I said, "Is it possible that you couldn't understand it either?" He said, "That's right, I had the same idea as everyone else: Our land in this mountain gully is stony and the soil is thin. If one mu of land can yield one or two shi, and everyone has enough to eat and wear every year, that's enough. How much better can our lives get if we establish a land cooperative? Later, the county committee sent cadres to work with Branch Secretary Zhang Tuxiao, Branch Committee Member Li Furong, and Li Xinghai. Every day, they repeatedly explained the nature and future of land cooperatives at various meetings, talking about the road of collectivization and the wealthy and happy lives of Soviet farmers, and the achievements of Li Shunda's agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative and the Chuandi Village agricultural production cooperative. In this way, everyone's minds slowly turned around, and they understood that society had to move forward and that life could be further improved, and that establishing agricultural production cooperatives was guiding everyone to walk this road. As for our mountain land, although we cannot use tractors, forestry and animal husbandry can be developed. In this way, everyone understood the benefits of establishing the cooperative."

                ×    ×    ×

    In the evening, the members finished their literacy classes at the cooperative school (a school run by the agricultural production cooperative) and returned one after another. Some people ran to Li Tongsuo's house. They knew that a comrade from Beijing was staying here, and they all wanted to ask what new things were happening in Beijing. I told them the new things I knew and talked with them about the issue of joining the cooperative. They were very interested in this issue.
    They said that after everyone understood the benefits of establishing the cooperative, it did not mean that there were no problems. Many people still worried about whether things would be as good as they said after joining the cooperative. At this time, Branch Secretary Zhang Tuxiao, Branch Committee Member Li Furong, Li Xinghai, and others took the lead in joining the cooperative. They said, "There is nothing wrong with listening to Chairman Mao." Then, some Party and League members followed suit, also saying, "There is nothing wrong with listening to Chairman Mao." This sentence was like a beacon, reminding everyone. Anti-traitors, anti-bullies, rent reduction, interest reduction, land reform, organizing mutual aid - which of these things didn't lead to our liberation and the good lives we have today because we listened to Chairman Mao? So people gradually followed and joined the cooperative. However, some people had not yet figured it out.
    In the village, mobilization work for joining the cooperative was underway here and there.
    Branch Committee Member Li Xinghai went to Li Haizhen's house. They had just held a family meeting. Li Haizhen said, "Our land in the mutual aid team can yield one shi and six or seven dou per mu. It's not certain that it will yield more if we join the cooperative. Joining the cooperative or not doesn't mean anything." Li Xinghai understood Li Haizhen's meaning: he put a lot of effort into planting and added more fertilizer than others. He was afraid that after joining the cooperative, others would not work hard and everyone would not be able to increase production. Li Xinghai said, "In the mutual aid team, adding effort and fertilizer is done by each person individually. Whoever has the ability invests as much as they can. When we get to the cooperative, we will add effort and fertilizer in a unified way, pay attention to scientific techniques, and tap the potential of the land. There is no problem in increasing production." Li Haizhen looked at Li Xinghai without saying a word, indicating that he agreed with his statement. But he raised another question: "Land cooperatives mainly distribute dividends based on labor. Our family has five people, and besides my wife and daughter-in-law, I am the only one who can contribute labor. What will happen if we don't get enough grain in the future?" Li Xinghai told him that the cooperative pays men and women equally for equal work, and women who participate in production can also earn labor days and receive grain like men. Li Haizhen was happy. He said, "If that's the case, four of the five people in our family will be able to work." At the second family meeting, they unanimously agreed to join the cooperative.
    At Li Ailiu's house, Li Ailiu disagreed with his wife Zhang Yuexian's suggestion and did not want to join the cooperative. He felt that the current situation was good. His son-in-law often had surplus labor and livestock to help him do work in the mutual aid team. He felt that it was already very difficult for his weak body to benefit from this. If he joined the cooperative, his son-in-law would not be able to help in this way, and he would have to do everything himself. He was already over forty years old and did not have a son. He thought it might be because his body was too weak. Therefore, he was unwilling to work too hard, fearing that it would ruin his health and affect his future ability to have children. He felt that his wife's proposal to join the cooperative completely failed to understand his difficulties. But Zhang Yuexian had her own ideas. She thought, the family had been helping each other with the whole village for ten years, and in this long period, there were so many things worth cherishing! During the War of Resistance Against Japan, everyone farmed while fighting guerrilla warfare with the enemy. When the enemy burned, killed, and looted in the village, everyone helped each other and overcame difficult times together. During the land reform, everyone was allocated land. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production, everyone often studied together how to add effort and fertilizer and improve farming techniques. When the crops were harvested well, everyone celebrated the bumper harvest together. Zhang Yuexian cherished these deep feelings of labor that had grown stronger over the years of mutual assistance. When she heard people promoting the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, thought about the future of her mutual aid team moving towards collectivization, and saw the old partners who had been helping each other for ten years joining the cooperative one after another, these feelings of labor burned in her heart. She couldn't wait to join the cooperative immediately. But her husband, like a piece of wood, completely failed to understand her feelings.
    Branch Committee Member Li Furong helped the couple resolve this dispute. Their dispute had developed to such a serious extent that the impatient Zhang Yuexian, unable to persuade her husband, had already proposed to divorce him. Li Furong criticized her for this rash behavior and told her that she must persuade him patiently. Then, Li Furong participated in their family meeting. Li Furong first explained to Li Ailiu, "Your body is weak, so naturally you have to take care of it, but you can't rely on your son-in-law to help you with work for the rest of your life. His hometown is in She County, Hebei Province. His family has already been allocated land. He will eventually return to his hometown one day. Who will you rely on for help then?" Zhang Yuexian said, "That's right, relying on yourself is the most reliable. Don't worry if your body is not good. The cooperative said that it will use labor rationally and allocate work according to each person's strengths. If you are weak and cannot carry things, then manage the plow - aren't you a good plowman?" Li Ailiu felt that their words made sense, but he continued to defend himself, saying, "It sounds so good, but I see that if we join the cooperative, we will become one big family, and eating and wearing will not be free. How can that be better than the mutual aid team? We can do whatever we want with the grain we harvest. In my opinion, let's not join if we can avoid it." Zhang Yuexian became agitated again when she heard these words. She said, "Every household has joined the cooperative, and we won't join. Then let's go it alone. Chairman Mao told us to organize, and we want to go it alone. How can we be worthy of Chairman Mao?" Saying this, she suddenly felt the discomfort of being an individual farmer - just take these few days, for example. People who have joined the cooperative are enthusiastically holding meetings every day to discuss the establishment of the cooperative. They have not joined the cooperative, so no one pays attention to them, and they just stay at home. And this unpleasant feeling is only the beginning. What will happen in the future? Zhang Yuexian thought of this, and a crystal tear welled up in her eyes. Li Furong said, "What Yuexian said makes sense. Everyone has joined the cooperative. What can you achieve by going it alone? Have you forgotten the situation when we went it alone before we organized mutual aid? As for the issue of not being free to eat and wear after joining the cooperative, that's not a problem. If you are short of food and clothing, can everyone watch you go hungry and freeze? We had to help each other in the mutual aid team. How much more so in the land cooperative now!" After ten years of training in organization, Li Ailiu understood these principles, but he was temporarily blinded by the veil of selfishness. Now that they have helped him peel it off layer by layer, he completely understood. He said with shame, "To be honest, I didn't want to join the cooperative because I had a personal plan. It was so dangerous, I almost took the wrong path."
    The work of mobilizing people to join the cooperative continued from household to household. All twenty households joined the cooperative.

    On the third day in Dongzhuang, I visited to learn about the situation after the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative. Branch Secretary Zhang Tuxiao said that after the establishment of the cooperative, the struggle between individualistic ideology and collectivist ideology was still very intense. Strengthening the leadership of the Party, giving play to the exemplary role of Party members, overcoming individualistic ideology, and establishing collectivist ideology are very important. He said, "When livestock was priced for joining the cooperative, there was a lot of debate - last year, ten households in the mutual aid team bought four horses. At that time, the price of horses was 20 percent higher than the current price. They wanted to sell them to the cooperative at last year's price. Other members disagreed, insisting on calculating according to the current market price. Both sides argued endlessly. Later, some members said, 'Why bother, let's just use cows, that's all.' But then there wouldn't be enough livestock." Zhang Tuxiao talked about the process of resolving this problem: Seven of the ten households with horses were Party and League members, and three were ordinary people. The branch educated the Party and League members that it was fair to price the horses according to the current market price and that a minority must not allow everyone to suffer. Otherwise, if everyone didn't buy horses, there wouldn't be enough livestock, which would affect production. The seven Party and League members understood the problem and helped the three ordinary households to understand the idea. The four horses were then entered into the cooperative at the current market price.
    "The issue of land shares and assessing yields was also a matter of contention," Zhang Tuxiao said, talking about the second thing. The process was as follows: When discussing land shares and assessing yields, some members, because they had worked hard and applied fertilizer on their land, and the grain they harvested was more than others, advocated assessing land grades according to actual yields. Other members disagreed. Their land was not well planted and the yields were relatively low. They advocated assessing land grades according to expected yields. Both sides argued endlessly, and no one wanted to suffer losses. The branch studied a way to solve this problem: The majority of those with good land were Party members. The reason why their land was good was because they had more actively responded to the government's call to increase production in recent years and vigorously added effort and fertilizer. It was reasonable for them to propose assessing land grades according to actual yields. But since the masses' thinking was blocked, Party members should yield to the masses and agree to assess land grades according to expected yields. The branch educated Party members, explaining the importance of temporary interests obeying long-term interests. The reason why the masses' land was not well planted was because there was little manure and the livestock was small. After their land was put into the cooperative, the cooperative would uniformly use labor and livestock, and uniformly add effort and fertilizer. These poor lands would slowly become better. When the land became better and more grain was harvested, wouldn't everyone be able to share more grain? The branch's education made Party members realize the importance of temporary interests obeying long-term interests. Li Xinghai said, "The purpose of establishing the cooperative is to move towards the road of collectivization, but it is not enough to rely on a few Communist Party members to walk this road. Communist Party members must lead the masses forward together. It is precisely in order to unite the masses to walk together towards the road of collectivization that we are willing to suffer a little loss in the current assessment of production." Li Xinghai's words inspired many Party members, and they all agreed with the branch's method of assessing land grades according to expected yields.
    Zhang Tuxiao is a talkative person. Now he talked about the third thing: how the branch led the masses to fight against natural disasters and ensure that the agricultural production cooperative achieved a bumper harvest.
    In May, more than 120 mu of autumn crops in the agricultural production cooperative were damaged by hail. These crops were lying on the ground, and the leaves were submerged in the thin mud. When the members saw this situation, they lost confidence in striving for a bumper harvest in 1952, and some even complained about the cooperative, saying, "Last year, the mutual aid team only applied 50 or 60 loads of manure per mu, but this year the cooperative applied more than 90 loads of manure per mu. We invested so much money. Now everyone will lose out!"
    Zhang Tuxiao said, "At this time, the cooperative convened a Party group meeting and decided to first straighten up the seedlings. Under the leadership of Party members, the seedlings were straightened up. But the second step was difficult to handle." At the Party group meeting, everyone saw that the seedlings had been straightened up and decided to strive to complete the original plan of increasing grain production by 60 jin per mu. The key issue at the time was to vigorously apply topdressing fertilizer. However, the masses and some Party members resolutely opposed applying topdressing fertilizer. They said: The crops have already been damaged, and applying topdressing fertilizer is equivalent to waste. They planned to secretly sell the originally prepared topdressing fertilizer - 3,500 jin of soybean cake. They said, "The crops are hopeless, this soybean cake is worth 15 or 16 shi of rice. If we sell it, everyone will get one shi and eight dou, which can be used to get through a famine in the future." The branch discovered this problem and decided to patiently persuade the masses to change this wrong approach. The branch pointed out: applying topdressing fertilizer is in line with scientific principles and will definitely increase grain production. If, in any case, the amount of grain produced is not enough to repay the county supply and marketing cooperative for the soybean cake, the cooperative can sign a contract with the county supply and marketing cooperative to postpone repayment until 1953. At the same time, it pointed out: "The county selected our village to establish a cooperative in order to set an example for the whole county and promote everyone to move towards the road of collectivization. If we don't do a good job in production, how can we set an example? Our mutual aid team used to be a model team in the whole county and overcame countless natural disasters. Does it mean that after establishing a cooperative today, we don't have the courage to overcome natural disasters?" The branch's opinion persuaded everyone, and everyone decided to apply all the soybean cake as topdressing fertilizer, and also added 30 loads of sheep manure. Soon after applying the topdressing fertilizer, there was a heavy rain, and the crops went from a state of decline to being very lush. At the time of harvest, everyone saw that the crops in 1952 yielded almost twice as much grain as in previous years, and they happily said, "If our cooperative did not have the leadership of the branch, it would not have yielded so little grain, how could we have had a bumper harvest!" (To be continued)

    在一个农业生产合作社里
    古维进
    去年十一月间，太行山下了大雪。在白茫茫的雪山里，快要黄昏的时候，我走到群山环抱的山西沁县东庄。这是一个自然村，有二十户人家。
    张秃小领着我走进村子，他边走边道：
    “咱这地方，山高路窄，十分偏僻，要不是办了个合作社（农业生产合作社），外面的人是很少到来的。”
    张秃小是东庄编村的中共支部书记，也是农业生产合作社的社员。提起合作社，他兴致勃勃地继续说道：
    “咱社自今年春天办起来之后，在春夏秋三季丰产评比当中，来参观的人实在多：有全村互助组员，有全县各村的互助组代表，有省里、专署和县里派来的干部，现在你们也来了。打算登报吗？”我说：“参观的人说了些什么呢？”他说：“大家都说我们的庄稼长得好，可不是嘛，一百七十七亩六分秋地全部增产啦！”我们向着村子的东头走去，张秃小兴奋地谈着增产的情形：一九五一年在互助组里，每亩秋地平均产量三二九点六斤，一九五二年成立了农业生产合作社，每亩秋地平均产量四一五点三八斤，比一九五一年增产八五点七八斤。超过全村一九五二年的平均产量百分之六十二，超过本村最好的互助组的平均产量百分之四十八，超过本村最好的单干户的平均产量百分之一百四十九。全社二十户人家，若以一九五一年收粮为基数，一九五二年增产粮食十五石至二十石的有五户，增产十石至十五石的五户，增产七石至十石的四户，增产五石至七石的六户（自留地的收入尚未计算在内）。加上一九五一年在互助组积下的余粮，现在每户平均有余粮十四、五石至二十石左右。
    这时村子静悄悄的，有许多人家的门已经锁起来了。我问张秃小道：“满山遍野都是大雪，村里人那里去了呢？”旁边一个老汉答道：“都去气村参加物资交流大会去了。”
    晚上，我住在李同锁的家里。他在物资交流大会上买回了大号花线毯子、灰斜纹布和纸烟，等等。李同锁说，在物资交流大会上，他们这个合作社的社员每个人都买了好几万元的日用品，至于他，已经买了十几万元日用品了。
    灯光下，李同锁反来覆去地欣赏他新买的花线毯子。忽然，他高兴地说：“要不是办了土地社，咱的生活还能变成这样？”我说：“你从前的生活呢？”他说：“打忙工，赌钱，抽大烟，偷东西。可是自从土地改革分了地，入了互助组，就过起吃穿有余的日子来了。今年入了土地社，生活越发好，咱个人就分了二十石粮食，除去吃穿，能余下十多石。”
                ×    ×    ×
    第二天，我访问了农业生产合作社的许多社员。社员们知道我从北京来，都热情地打听毛主席的近况、首都的建设和朝鲜的战争。之后，我和社员谈起一九五二年农业生产合作社的丰产和社员的生活。他们都把这些成绩和支部书记张秃小、支部委员李富荣（社长）、李兴孩（社里的生产小组长兼村长）联系起来。他们说，这些优秀的共产党员领导他们在组织起来的基础上继续前进，才有了今日的好时光。
    这一天，我被分派到生产副小组长李富和家里吃饭。李富和给我谈到这样一个问题：当开始酝酿办社的时候，许多人存在“生产到顶”的思想，不主张办社。“这是怎么一回事情呢？”李富和说：
    “咱村二十户人家，自从一九四二年组织互助组，一直互助到一九五一年。在这十年里边，特别是在五年前土地改革以后，每户都分到土地、牲口，互助组又讲究耕作技术，生产发展的很快。战前每亩地平均打九斗粮，现在每亩地平均打一石六斗左右。每户每年都有多少余粮。战前‘半年糠菜半年粮’的生活，已经变成吃穿不缺的生活了。这时候，许多人都感到组织起来就是这个样，不会有更大的前途。可是上级却号召进一步组织起来，试办土地社。许多人都打不通思想。”李富和说到这里，忽然缄默起来。我说：“是不是你也打不通思想呢？”他说：“可不是嘛，咱也和大家一个想法：咱这山凹凹地，石厚土薄，一亩地能打下一两石，大家每年吃穿有余，也就够了。办土地社还能使咱们的生活好到那里去呢？后来县委会派来干部，和支书张秃小、支部委员李富荣、李兴孩一起，每天在各种会议上反复解释土地社的性质和前途，讲苏联农民走向集体化的道路和富裕幸福的生活，讲李顺达的农林畜牧生产合作社和川底村农业生产合作社的成绩，这样，大家的脑筋才慢慢转过来，了解社会还要往前走，生活还能再提高，办农业生产合作社就是引导大家向着这条道路走。至于说到咱这个山地，虽然不能使用拖拉机，造林和畜牧却是能发展的。这样，大家都了解办社的好处了。”
                ×    ×    ×
    晚上，社员们在社校（农业生产合作社办的学校）上完速成识字课，陆续回去了。有的人跑到李同锁的家里。他们知道这里住了一个北京来的同志，都想从这里问问北京有些什么新鲜的事情。我把所知道的新事情都告诉他们，就和他们谈起入社的问题。他们对于这个问题很有兴趣。
    他们说，当大家了解了办社的好处以后，并不等于没有问题了。许多人还顾虑入社以后是不是就像说的这样好。这时候，支部书记张秃小、支部委员李富荣、李兴孩等带头入社。他们说：“听毛主席的话没有错。”接着，一些党团员跟着入社，他们也说：“听毛主席的话没有错。”这句话像一盏明灯，提醒了所有的人。反奸反霸，减租减息，土地改革，组织互助，那一件不是听了毛主席的话，才有今天的翻身生活呢！于是人们逐渐跟着入了社。但是，有一部分人还没有想通。
    村子里，这里那里进行着动员入社的工作。
    支部委员李兴孩到了李海珍家里。他们刚开过家庭会议。李海珍说：“咱的地在互助组里，一亩就能打一石六七，入了社不见得能多打。入社不入社没甚意思。”李兴孩了解了李海珍的意思：他种地下工夫，比别人多加工加肥，他害怕入社以后，别人不好好劳动，大家不能增产。李兴孩说：“在互助组里，加工加肥是各管各，谁有多少能力投多少资。到了社里，统一加工加肥，又讲究科学技术，发挥土地潜力，增产不成问题。”李海珍望着李兴孩没有作声，表示同意他的说法。但是他又提出另一个问题：“土地社以劳力分红为主，咱家五口人，除了老婆、儿媳妇，就我一个人能顶个劳动力，将来分不下几颗粮食怎么办？”李兴孩告诉他：社里男女同工同酬，妇女参加生产，同样能顶劳动日，和男人一样分粮食。李海珍高兴了，他说：“要是这样，咱家五口人就有四口人能劳动了。”在第二次家庭会议上，他们一致同意入社。
    在李爱留家里，李爱留不同意他妻子张月仙的主张，不想入社。他觉得现在的情况就不错。他女婿经常有剩余的劳力和畜力帮助他在互助组里做活，他感到能够沾上这份光，对于他的孱弱的身体说来，已经是很难得的了。如果入了社，女婿就不能这样帮忙，一切都得自己去干了。他今年已经四十多岁，还没有一个男孩，他考虑可能是自己的身体太弱的缘故。因此他不愿过份的劳动，怕把身体累坏，影响将来的生孩子。他感到妻子主张入社，完全不理解他这个苦衷。但是张月仙有她自己的想法。她想，家里已经和全村人家互助十年了，在这漫长的岁月中，有多少值得留恋的东西啊！在抗日战争时期，大伙曾经一边种地，一边和敌人打游击；敌人在村里烧杀掳掠，大伙在一起互借互济，度过艰难的岁月；土地改革时，大伙分了土地；为了响应毛主席增产的号召，大伙时常在一块研究怎样加工加肥，提高耕作技术；庄稼收成好了，大伙共同庆祝丰年。张月仙非常珍惜这些由于长年互助而日益增长起来的深厚的劳动感情。她听到人们宣传农业生产合作社的优越性，想到自己的互助组将要走向集体化的前途，又看见十年来在一块互助的老伙伴纷纷入了社，她这种劳动感情在心底里燃烧起来了，她巴不得马上入社。但是丈夫像一块木头似的完全不理解她这种感情。
    支部委员李富荣帮助这对夫妇解决了这个争执。他们的争执已经发展到这样严重的程度：性急的张月仙说服不了丈夫，已经提出要和丈夫离婚了。李富荣批评了她这种鲁莽的作法，告诉她必须耐心进行说服。接着，李富荣参加了他们的家庭会议。李富荣首先给李爱留解释道：“你身体弱，自然要爱护身体，可是你不能一辈子依靠女婿帮你做活。他老家住在河北涉县，他家已经分了土地，他总有一天要回到老家去。那时候你靠谁帮忙呢？”张月仙道：“这话顶真，靠自己才牢靠。你身体不好，不怕，社里说过合理使用劳动力，按照特长分配工作，你力薄不能担，就管犁吧——你不是犁地的好把式吗？”李爱留觉得他们的话有道理，但是继续辩护道：“说的那么好，我看入了社，成了一大家，吃穿都不自由，那能比互助组？打下粮食自己要怎样处理就怎样处理。依我说，能不入咱就不入。”张月仙听了这话，又激动起来了。她说：“家家户户都入了社，咱们就不入，那就单干吧。毛主席叫咱们组织起来，咱们就要单干，这对得起毛主席吗？”说到这里，她忽然感觉到当单干户的难受——就说这几天吧，入了社的人每天都在热烈地开会讨论建社的问题，他们没有入社，没有人理睬，自己就呆在家里。而且这种不好受的滋味才只是开始，将来怎么办呢？张月仙想到这里，眼眶噙着一颗晶莹的泪珠。李富荣道：“月仙说的都是道理，大家都入了社，单干还能干成个甚呢？你忘记咱们没有组织互助时候那种单干的情形吗？至于说到入社以后吃穿不自由，这就不是一个问题。你缺吃缺穿，大伙还能看你饿着冻着？咱在互助组的时候，还要互借互济，何况现在是土地社呢！”李爱留经过十年来组织起来的锻炼，是明白这些道理的，只不过一时被自私的纱幕蒙住罢了。现在他们帮助他把它一层层地揭掉之后，他完全明白过来了。他惭愧地说：“说实在话，咱不愿入社，是有个个人打算，好危险，差点儿走错了道路。”
    动员入社的工作一户一户地进行下去。二十户人家都入了社。
    在东庄的第三天，我访问了农业生产合作社建社以后的情形。支部书记张秃小说，建社以后，个体主义思想与集体主义思想的斗争仍然是很激烈的，加强党的领导，发挥党员的模范作用，克服个体主义思想，树立集体主义思想，是非常重要的。他说：“当牲口作价入社的时候，大家争论很厉害——去年互助组有十户人家买了四匹马，那时马的价钱比现在的价钱大百分之二十。他们要照去年的价钱卖给社里。旁的社员都不同意，坚持要照现在的市价计算。双方争执不下。后来有的社员说：‘这么麻烦，干脆不用马，光用牛好了。’但是这样牲口就不够用了。”张秃小谈到解决这个问题的经过：这十户有马户有七个人是党团员，有三个人是群众。支部教育党团员说，照现在的市价作价才公道，少数人决不能让大家吃亏。要不然，大家不买马，牲口不够用，就要影响生产。七个党团员把问题想通了，帮助三户群众打通思想，四匹马便照现在的市价入了社。
    “土地入股，评定产量，也是一个争论的问题。”张秃小谈到第二件事情。这件事情的经过是这样的：讨论土地入股，评定产量的时候，有一部分社员因为在自己的土地上加了工，上了粪，打的粮食比旁人多，就主张按实产量评地等。另外一部分社员不同意。他们的土地种的不大好，产量比较低，他们主张按应产量评地等。双方争执不下，谁都不愿意吃亏。支部研究了解决这个问题的办法：地好的人绝大部分是党员，他们的地所以好，是因为他们这几年比一般群众更积极地响应了政府增加生产的号召，大力加工加肥。他们提出按实产量评地等是合理的。但是群众的思想既然打不通，党员就应该向群众让步，同意按应产量评地等。支部向党员进行了教育，说明群众的地所以种的不好，是因为粪土少，牲口小。他们的土地入社以后，社里统一使用劳力畜力，统一加工加肥，这些不好的地慢慢就能变好了。地变好了，粮食打多了，大家不是都能多分粮食吗？支部的教育使党员认识到暂时利益服从长远利益的重要。李兴孩说：“办社是为了走向集体化的道路，但是要走这条道路，光靠几个共产党员是不行的。共产党员必须带领群众一块前进。目前评产吃点亏，正是为了团结群众一块走向集体化的道路。”李兴孩的话启发了许多党员，他们都同意支部按应产量评地等的办法。
    张秃小是一个健谈的人。现在他又谈到第三件事情：支部怎样领导群众与自然灾害作斗争，保证农业生产合作社得到丰产的问题。
    五月间，农业生产合作社有一百二十多亩秋庄稼给冰雹打坏了。这些庄稼东倒西歪，叶子漫在稀泥里。社员看见这种情况，失去争取一九五二年的丰产的信心，有的人还埋怨合作社说：“去年互助组每亩地才上五六十担粪，今年社里每亩地就上九十多担粪，下了这样大的本钱，这一下可把大家都亏啦！”
    张秃小说：“这时候，社里召开了党组会，决定先把苗子扶起来。在党员带头下，把苗扶起来了。但是第二步就不好办了。”在党组会上，大家看见苗已扶起来，决定争取完成原定每亩地增产粮食六十斤的计划。当时的关键问题就是大力上追肥。但是群众和一些党员坚决反对上追肥。他们说：庄稼已经打坏了，上追肥等于浪费。他们计划偷偷地把原来准备的追肥——三千五百斤豆饼——卖掉。他们说：“庄稼没有指望了，这些豆饼值十五六石米，卖掉它，大家分得一石八斗，将来可以过饥荒。”支部发现了这个问题，决定耐心说服群众，改变这种错误的作法。支部指出：上追肥合乎科学的道理，一定可以多打粮食；如果万一打的粮食不多，还不起县供销社的豆饼，社里可以和县供销社定合同，延期到一九五三年还账。同时指出：“县里挑选咱村办社，为的是在全县起示范作用，推动大家走向集体化的道路，如果搞不好生产，怎样起示范作用呢。咱们的互助组曾经是全县的模范组，战胜过无数次的自然灾害，难道今天办了社，反倒没有战胜自然灾害的勇气了吗！”支部的意见说服了所有的人，大家决定把全部豆饼上了追肥，另外还添了三十担羊粪。上过追肥不久，就下了一场大雨，庄稼从衰颓的状态变得十分茂盛。收割的时候，大家看见一九五二年的庄稼比往年几乎多打了一倍粮食，都高兴地说：“咱社要是没有支部的领导，不少打粮食就好了，那还能丰产呢！”（未完）
