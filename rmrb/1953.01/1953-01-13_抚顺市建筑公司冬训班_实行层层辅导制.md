    Fushun City Construction Company Winter Training Class
    Implements a Layered Tutoring System

    [This newspaper reported] The winter training class of the Fushun City Construction Company in Northeast China has implemented a layered tutoring system, solving the difficulties of having few tutors and low levels of education. The learning results of the trainees are good.

    Most of the company's fixed workers are of peasant origin with low levels of education. At the beginning of the training class, during political study discussions, everyone was reluctant to speak. Some said the topics were too deep, others said, "It goes in one ear and out the other." Some didn't even understand the meaning of the discussion topics. In such a situation, it was extremely necessary to strengthen learning guidance. However, at that time, the training class had more than 1,400 students but only ten formal tutors. The political and cultural level of the tutors was also not high. During discussions, they didn't know who was speaking correctly and who was speaking incorrectly. No one summarized the discussion results, and there was no conclusion to the arguments. Some workers reflected, "After discussing for half a day, we're left confused!"

    In order to solve this problem, the company adopted a method of layered tutoring: senior tutors training junior tutors, and junior tutors training group leaders. Tutors from each team jointly organized a study group. They first understood the discussion topics themselves and reached a consensus, and then uniformly arranged the discussion. Before the discussion, the director tutor (team leader) of each team would use 30 to 50 minutes to explain the basic spirit of each topic to the tutors (class leaders, group leaders) of the class. Then, the class leaders and group leaders would discuss it once, and the director tutor would then point out the key to the problem, affirm the correct ones, and criticize the incorrect ones, so that the class leaders and group leaders would have a clear idea. After the class tutors understood the problems, they provided tutoring work at any time during group discussions. After the group discussions, each group leader reported the difficult problems to the class tutor, and the class tutor then summarized the correct opinions of each group and told them to the workers, giving a correct answer. The use of this layered tutoring method not only expanded the tutoring force but also ensured the tutoring effect. For example, when discussing "What is the working class?" many workers did not have a clear understanding, but because the class tutor was well prepared in advance, he quickly explained the problem clearly. With good tutoring work, the workers' enthusiasm for learning also increased. Previously, the first class of the first team spoke the least during discussions. Now, as soon as the meeting starts, more than 80% of the students can speak enthusiastically and can actively raise questions, thus effectively ensuring the learning effect.

    Editor's note: In the political study of winter training for basic construction workers, strengthening the tutoring work for students is one of the important conditions for ensuring the learning effect. The role of tutors is: to actively reflect the students' ideological situation, acceptance ability, etc. to the teachers before the lectures; after the lectures, to repeat what the teachers said in a popular and specific way to the students to help them understand the content of the courses they have heard. At present, the tutoring work in many winter training units is still very weak, with a small number of tutors and poor quality; some tutors even explain the problems incorrectly. This affects the learning effect. The layered tutoring system of the Fushun City Construction Company Winter Training Class is a good way to solve this problem and is worthy of reference by various units.

### 抚顺市建筑公司冬训班  实行层层辅导制

    抚顺市建筑公司冬训班
    实行层层辅导制
    【本报讯】东北抚顺市建筑公司冬季训练班实行层层辅导制，解决了辅导员人数少、文化水平不高的困难，学员学习效果良好。
    该公司固定的工人大部系农民出身，文化水平很低。训练班开学初期，在政治学习讨论会上，大家都不爱发言。有人说题太深，有人说：“这个耳朵听，那个耳朵就冒了。”有的甚至对讨论题的意思都不懂。在这样的情况下，极需加强学习辅导。但当时训练班一千四百多名学员，却只配备了十名正式辅导员。辅导员的政治、文化水平也不高，在讨论会上不知道谁说得对，谁说得不对。讨论结果也没人归纳，争论意见也没有结论。有的工人反映：“讨论了半天，闹个稀里糊涂！”
    为了解决这一问题，该公司采取了大辅导员培养小辅导员、小辅导员培养小组长的层层辅导的办法。各队辅导员共同组织了一个学习研究组，自己先把讨论题搞通，并取得一致的认识，然后统一布置讨论。在讨论会前利用三十分至五十分钟的时间，由各队主任辅导员（队长）对班的辅导员（班长、组长）解释每道题的基本精神，然后让班长、组长讨论一遍，主任辅导员再指出问题关键所在，肯定正确的，批判错误的，使班长、组长心里有数。班的辅导员们把问题弄通以后，在各学习小组讨论时就随时做辅导工作。小组讨论后，各小组长把疑难问题汇报给班辅导员，班辅导员再把各小组的正确意见归纳起来讲给工人听，作出正确的答案。采用了这种层层辅导的办法，不但扩大了辅导力量，而且保证了辅导效果。如讨论“什么是工人阶级”时，很多工人认识不明确，但班辅导员因为事前准备充分，很快就把问题讲清楚了。辅导工作搞得好了，工人的学习情绪也提高了。从前第一队第一班开讨论会时发言最少，现在，一开会，百分之八十以上的学员都能热烈发言，并能主动提出问题，因而切实保证了学习效果。
    编者按：在基本建设工人冬季训练的政治学　习中，加强对学员的辅导工作，是保证学习效
    果的重要条件之一。辅导员的作用是：在讲课前把学员思想情况、接受能力等，主动反映给教员；讲课之后把教员讲的东西通俗地、具体地向学员重述，帮助学员理解所听的课程内容。目前许多冬训单位的辅导工作还很薄弱，辅导员的数量少、质量差；有的辅导员甚至把问题解释错了。这就影响了学习效果。抚顺市建筑公司冬季训练班的层层辅导制，是解决这一问题的好办法，值得各单位参考。
