    The Chinese People's Acrobatic Troupe, dispatched by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles at the invitation of Northern European countries to perform, returned to Beijing on December 27, 1952, after completing its performance mission. The troupe went to Finland in July 1952 at the invitation of the Finnish-Chinese Association to perform. Subsequently, at the invitation of prominent figures and cultural figures in Danish society, they went to Denmark in September. Then, at the invitation of the Swedish-Chinese Friendship Association, they transferred to Sweden in October. During the five months, they performed a total of 120 large and small performances in 67 cities in the three countries of Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. The troupe was warmly welcomed and praised by the broad audience and people from all walks of life in the three countries.

    This trip left a deep and good impression on the people of various countries, and the people of all places called the troupe benevolent and peaceful cultural envoys sent by the Chinese people. A physician from a royal hospital in Copenhagen thanked the troupe for their performance, saying: The arrival of the Chinese People's Acrobatic Troupe has aroused the local people's interest in increasing their understanding of New China and has changed the views of some people who have always believed that only Western culture leads the world's culture.

    中国人民杂技团由北欧返京
    据新华社讯：由中华全国文学艺术界联合会派出应邀赴北欧表演的中国人民杂技团，在演出工作结束后，已于一九五二年十二月二十七日返抵北京。该团在一九五二年七月间应芬兰“芬中协会”的邀请前往芬兰表演，随后又应丹麦社会名流及文化界知名人士的邀请，于九月间赴丹麦，再应瑞典瑞中友好协会的邀请于十月间转赴瑞典。五个月期间，共在芬兰、丹麦、瑞典三个国家的六十七个城市作了大小一百二十次的演出。该团在演出中受到三国广大观众和各界人士的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    该团此行给各国人民留下了深刻的良好的印象，各地人民都称该团为中国人民派出来的善意的、和平的文化使者。哥本哈根一位皇家医院的医师对该团的演出致谢说：中国人民杂技团的到来，引起了当地人民提高对新中国认识的兴趣，并且改变了一些向来以为只有西方文化才是领导着全世界文化的人的看法。
