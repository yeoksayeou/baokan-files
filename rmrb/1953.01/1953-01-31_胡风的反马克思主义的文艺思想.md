Editor's Note: When this newspaper reprinted Shu Wu's "Learning 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' from Scratch" on June 8, 1952, the editor's note pointed out that the literary thought of Hu Feng and his small group "is essentially a bourgeois and petty-bourgeois individualistic literary thought." This kind of literary thought, because it is covered by some "leftist" and "Marxist-Leninist" rhetoric, has a confusing effect on some petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Therefore, it must be criticized fundamentally. Lin Mohan's "Hu Feng's Anti-Marxist Literary Thought" (originally published in the second issue of "Literary Gazette" this year) reveals the essence of Hu Feng's literary thought from some basic issues and points out the fundamental difference between this literary thought and Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong literary thought, which is helpful to the current development of literary thought work. This article is now reprinted here for the reference and research of literary workers.

Many comrades have criticized Hu Feng's erroneous literary thoughts. On June 8th last year, when the "People's Daily" reprinted Shu Wu's self-criticism article "Learning 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' from Scratch," the editor's note clearly and concisely pointed out the erroneous nature of the literary thought of Hu Feng and his small group, believing that it "is essentially a bourgeois and petty-bourgeois individualistic literary thought." However, these criticisms have not caused Hu Feng to face and examine his mistakes squarely. In order to help Hu Feng recognize his erroneous thoughts, a number of comrades and Hu Feng held several symposiums some time ago to discuss his literary thoughts. After these symposiums, although Hu Feng began to make some self-criticisms on individual issues, he still did not thoroughly recognize his erroneous viewpoints on fundamental issues.

Before criticizing Hu Feng's literary thought, it should be stated that Hu Feng had long been engaged in literary activities in the Kuomintang-ruled area, and politically he stood on the side of progress and fought against the Kuomintang's reactionary fascist culture. Hu Feng has made his contributions in this regard. His literary thought is not entirely wrong, and it also contains correct elements on certain individual issues. However, certain correct views on individual issues cannot change the fundamentally erroneous nature of his literary thought. Hu Feng's literary thought is anti-Marxist in essence and runs counter to the literary and artistic policies indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong. However, Hu Feng has consistently regarded himself as a Marxist literary theorist and has consistently believed that his literary thought is in line with Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policies. Precisely because of this, his erroneous literary thought, which is often decorated with Marxist rhetoric, has played a certain confusing role among some people. At the same time, although this kind of literary thought is not very common, it may also exist among other literary workers. Therefore, it is still necessary today to clarify the essence of Hu Feng's literary thought and point out the fundamental errors of this kind of literary thought.

Our criticism intends to focus on Hu Feng's literary theory after the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," because from here we can clearly see the fundamental difference between Hu Feng's literary thought and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy. However, Hu Feng's erroneous literary thought has its consistent roots and has been developing all along. Therefore, we cannot but trace back to some of Hu Feng's papers before the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The root cause of Hu Feng's erroneous literary thought lies in his consistent adoption of a non-class viewpoint to treat literary and artistic issues. He does not examine various literary and artistic phenomena from the root of class, but seeks the causes of literary and artistic phenomena apart from class relations. However, in a class society, leaving the class viewpoint will inevitably lead oneself into error.

Hu Feng's error is significantly manifested in his view of realism. Hu Feng has always regarded himself as a supporter and protector of realism, but what kind of realism does Hu Feng understand? In his theory, there is no fundamental difference between old realism and socialist realism. In Hu Feng's view, what is the fundamental problem of realism? That is what he has consistently advocated as the writer's so-called "subjective fighting spirit" and the combination of this "subjective fighting spirit" with objective reality. According to him, the strength or absence of the writer's "subjective fighting spirit" is the sign of the strength or absence of realism. Here, first, Hu Feng one-sidedly and inappropriately emphasizes the so-called "subjective fighting spirit" without emphasizing the more important faithfulness to reality, which is fundamentally anti-realist; second, the "subjective fighting spirit" mentioned by Hu Feng is an abstract thing without class content, so the realism he said is also just an abstract thing without class content. However, such realism does not actually exist. In a class society, all realism has its class nature. Leaving the class viewpoint and leaving the historical concreteness of realism in various eras, it is impossible to correctly understand realism. The fundamental problem of realism is definitely not the abstract "subjective fighting spirit" as Hu Feng said, because any writer has his own certain nature and certain degree of "subjective fighting spirit," and this "subjective fighting spirit" is first determined by his class stand. Old realism, such as critical realism, because it can face and criticize the reality at that time, expose the shortcomings and ugliness of the bourgeoisie, this realism has a great progressive role, but its reflection of reality and criticism of reality cannot but be limited by the class stand and world outlook on which it is based, so it is impossible to fully reflect the struggle of the working class and the laboring people. Obviously, this is not a question of the writer's "subjective fighting spirit," but first of all a question of the writer's class stand. Similarly, for socialist realists, the fundamental problem is not whether there is an abstract "subjective fighting spirit," but first of all to have the stand of the working class and the communist world outlook; without this stand and world outlook, no matter how strong your "subjective fighting spirit" is, it is impossible to correctly and fully reflect today's reality. Hu Feng's error is that he always leaves the class viewpoint and does not see the class nature of various realisms, so he does not see the fundamental difference between old realism and socialist realism.

This kind of thought is expressed very clearly in his article "A Brief Discussion on Literature Being Without a Gate":

	If a writer is faithful to art and strives wholeheartedly to
	seek the most authentic, the most vibrant, and the most
	capable of expressing the living content he wants to capture,
	then even if he, like Shiga (Naoya Shiga, a Japanese old
	realist writer - note by the translator), has not experienced
	great life waves, his works can still achieve a high degree of
	artistic truth. Because, when the author painstakingly
	pursues the expression that is seamlessly integrated with the
	response of his own body and mind, he is also pursuing life.
	The result of this pursuit is the embrace of the author and
	life, and at the same time, it is the embrace of life and art.
	This is a matter of the author's essential attitude, which
	absolutely cannot be achieved by the effort of hammering
	words and refining sentences. If we put it in abstract terms,
	that is, the real realistic creation method can make up for
	the writer's lack of life experience and the shortcomings of
	the world outlook. ("Notes on Misty Weather" page 99)
This is what Hu Feng said in 1937, but Hu Feng did not change this view later. Here, Hu Feng regards the so-called faithfulness to art as an absolute thing, believing that as long as the writer is faithful to art, he "can achieve a high degree of artistic truth," without asking about the writer's class stand, nor asking about which class's art he is faithful to. Hu Feng completely ignores the influence of the writer's class stand on his artistic activities. He believes that as long as the writer is faithful to art, he does not need any progressive political ideas and a progressive world outlook. This is precisely the hypocritical artistic theory of the bourgeoisie. The realistic creation method can make up for the writer's shortcomings in the world outlook, only for the old realists who cannot have the correct world outlook. Among the old realists, there are examples of making up for the shortcomings of the world outlook with the realistic creation method, such as Balzac (Balzac must of course be learned, but we must remember that even Balzac, due to the shortcomings of the world outlook, limited his understanding of reality, and did not become and could not become a socialist realist); but there are even more countless examples of reactionary world outlook damaging realism and damaging art. For today's socialist realists, if we still separate the world outlook and the creation method, or even abandon the world outlook, it is an unimaginable thing. Socialist realism itself requires that the authenticity and historical concreteness of artistic description must be combined with the task of educating the people ideologically with the socialist spirit. Then, without a progressive world outlook and socialist consciousness, how can one become a socialist realist? For socialist realists, the creation method and the world outlook cannot be split but can only be unified. But in Hu Feng's "theory," the critical realism of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois and socialist realism are always confused, because he always wants to steal the proletariat's literature and art and literary and artistic theory with the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literature and art and literary and artistic theory.

Confusing old realism and socialist realism, not critically studying and inheriting old realism, but regarding old realism as equal to socialist realism, its essence is to deny the role of the writer's world outlook, to deny that revolutionary writers must obtain a revolutionary class stand; naturally, it also denies the principle of party spirit in literature and art. Starting from such an erroneous viewpoint, Hu Feng cannot but make a series of errors on many issues.

Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle. The past disputes, differences, oppositions, and disunity among some comrades were not on this fundamental question of principle, but on some relatively secondary or even unprincipled questions. But on this question of principle, the two sides of the dispute did not have any differences, but were almost consistent, and both had some degree of contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers and a tendency to detach themselves from the masses. I say some degree, because generally speaking, the contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers and detachment from the masses of these comrades is different from the contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers and detachment from the masses of the Kuomintang. But in any case, this tendency exists. If this fundamental problem is not solved, many other problems will not be easily solved. ... Lu Xun once said: The disunity of the revolutionary literary and artistic front is because of the lack of a common goal, and this common goal is for the workers and peasants. This problem existed in Shanghai at that time, and it exists in Chongqing now. In those places, this problem is difficult to solve thoroughly, because in those places, some people oppress revolutionary literary and artistic workers and do not allow them to have the freedom to go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." This is the fundamental problem that has always existed among revolutionary literary and artistic workers. To solve this problem, we can only make literary and artistic workers go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, participate in the actual struggle of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and change from despising workers, peasants, and soldiers to loving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and from detaching themselves from the masses to approaching the masses. In a word, literary and artistic workers must transform their thinking, change their stand, and shift their stand from the petty-bourgeois side to the workers, peasants, and soldiers side. Of course, this problem was not easy to solve or not easy to solve thoroughly in the Kuomintang-ruled area at that time, but we cannot deny that this is a fundamental problem because there are many difficulties in solving this problem.

However, Hu Feng's view is not like this. Hu Feng also believes that there are shortcomings in revolutionary literature and art, which is the so-called tendency of subjective formulism and objectivism that he denounces. What are subjective formulism and objectivism? According to Hu Feng, realism is the "embrace" or combination of the writer's subjective fighting spirit and objective reality. The disconnection between subjective fighting spirit and objective reality produces either subjective formulism lacking objective reality, or objectivism lacking subjective fighting spirit. He believes that objectivism was the main trend in literary and artistic creation in the Kuomintang-ruled area during the Anti-Japanese War, and the way to overcome this trend is to strengthen the writer's subjective fighting spirit. Did those tendencies that Hu Feng denounced exist in the Kuomintang-ruled area at that time? We do not intend to discuss this issue here. But here we see two answers to the fundamental problem of revolutionary literature and art: According to the instructions of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the fundamental problem is that literary and artistic workers lack the common goal of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and despise the workers, peasants, and soldiers and detach themselves from the masses. The solution is to go deep into the masses and transform their own thinking. According to Hu Feng's theory, the fundamental problem is that the writer's subjective fighting spirit is not strong enough or has declined, and the solution is to strengthen the writer's subjective fighting spirit. Which of the two answers is correct? Obviously, the wrong one is Hu Feng. The error of this theory lies in the fact that it does not recognize that the fundamental problem of our literature and art is the problem of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thus denies that the fundamental problem of literary and artistic workers is ideological transformation, which is the problem of changing from one class to another; on the contrary, it abstractly requires writers to strengthen the so-called subjective fighting spirit, not to transform the writer's subjectivity first, but to strengthen their subjectivity. Obviously, this is a principled difference.

Comrade Mao Zedong sharply explained in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" why petty-bourgeois writers must transform their thinking, because

	"People from petty-bourgeois backgrounds always stubbornly
	express themselves and promote their own views through
	various methods, including literary and artistic methods,
	demanding that people transform the Party and transform the
	world according to the image of petty-bourgeois
	intellectuals." And following them, "is actually following
	the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is a danger
	of losing the Party and the country." Therefore, "we literary
	and artistic workers from intellectual backgrounds, in order
	to make our works welcomed by the masses, must make a
	change in our thoughts and feelings, and make a
	transformation. Without this change, without this
	transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything
	will be incompatible."
However, Hu Feng not only does not recognize the extremely important principled significance of this kind of ideological transformation, but on the contrary, he used a lot of space in his papers to defend petty-bourgeois intellectuals. He cannot see or does not admit that petty-bourgeois intellectuals generally have the problem of despising workers and peasants and detaching themselves from the masses, but excessively emphasizes that "they originally had or have some connection with the working people in life,"

	"They originally had or have various states of integration with
	the advanced people" ("On the Road of Realism").
From this, Hu Feng came to the following conclusion:

	Even if they have not yet accepted this revolutionary thought,
	before the struggle guided by this revolutionary thought
	occurs, intellectuals and writers who are connected with the
	people in a certain connection, due to the "observation" of
	reality, that is, "due to the lessons of facts" as Lu Xun said,
	although it is more difficult, they can still enter the content
	of the people to a corresponding extent, absorb the demands
	of the people into themselves, and thus grasp the true
	essence of historical reality. "A History of Literature"
	provides abundant examples, and Lu Xun stood out in Chinese
	history in this way. Because, revolutionary thought is formed
	by elevating the content of historical reality. Otherwise,
	there would be no historical materialism and no realism in
	the world. ("On the Road of Realism" page 80)
The meaning of this passage is very clear, which is that petty-bourgeois intellectual writers can not transform their thinking, and realism does not need a revolutionary stand and world outlook. Hu Feng's statement is a one-sided and erroneous explanation of "literary history." It is true that there are some great writers in literary history who, although they do not have correct revolutionary ideas, can write out the truth of history to some extent, even to a great extent, because they can face reality squarely. However, a certain ideological limit ultimately makes it impossible for him to completely "grasp the true essence of historical reality." In this situation, the writer often cannot help but fall into a contradiction, which will become more and more intense as the writer delves deeper into reality. For some writers, if they cannot resolve this contradiction (due to historical reasons or other reasons), the intensification of this contradiction may even form a crisis in life and creation. For some other modern writers, if he can resolve this contradiction, that is to say, if he can further break through the original ideological restrictions and obtain the revolutionary thought of the proletariat, he can greatly advance his creation, so that he can truly "grasp the true essence of historical reality." Lu Xun is the best example. He was not a socialist realist from the beginning, just as he was not a Marxist in his thinking from the beginning. He went from evolutionism to class theory, from the rebellious son and traitor of the gentry class to the friend and soldier of the proletariat. Correspondingly, in literature, he went from critical realism to socialist realism. In the middle of this, Lu Xun obviously experienced a profound process of self-ideological transformation. Lu Xun himself has narrated the process of this ideological transformation more than once. However, Hu Feng has always refused to admit that Lu Xun has experienced such a leap in his thinking. His actual intention is nothing more than to prove that petty-bourgeois intellectual writers are originally in the people, and there is no need to go through any ideological transformation, and there is no need to stand on the stand of the working class.

Perhaps Hu Feng will say: "The writer's subjective fighting spirit that I am talking about refers to the writer's class stand. However, because in the Kuomintang-ruled area, I cannot say it clearly, so I have to use this kind of 'slave language'." In fact, Hu Feng has changed "subjective fighting spirit" to "subjective ideological stand" in his book "On the Road of Realism" published in 1951. He said: "The central point is to strive to strengthen the subjective ideological stand or ideological requirements." However, the essence of things will not change because of a change of name. Hu Feng's so-called "subjective fighting spirit" is not a synonym for "class stand." This is very clear in his "Development of Literary and Artistic Work and Its Direction of Effort." It is difficult to swap the concept.

In this article, Hu Feng analyzes the characteristics of creation after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, believing that it is "the separate and simultaneous development of the elevation of subjective spirit and the flooding of objective spirit." "If these two spirits are not separated, but are integrated and permeated with each other, they will definitely produce true artistic life; in fact, some individual writers have done it at that time, and now there are a few writers who are working hard." However, because "the war has become a continuous daily life, literary and artistic workers have to engage in creation in the situation of managing a daily life, or strive to manage a daily life for the sake of engaging in creation. ... This has the possibility of being surrounded, fatigued, corroded, and captured by this daily life. ... The result will of course cause the decline of subjective fighting spirit, and the decline of subjective fighting spirit is also the decline of the ability to grasp, embrace, and attack objective reality at the same time." ("Days of Adversity" pages 2, 4, 7, 8)

That is to say, the literary and artistic workers' subjective fighting spirit was originally very strong, but it declined later, and the reason for the decline is that the war has become a continuous daily life, and the writers have been surrounded and captured by this stagnant daily life. Among this part of the writers, there have been works that are denounced by Hu Feng as having an objectivist tendency. And in another part of the writers, specifically, on the body of people such as Lu Ling, who are praised by Hu Feng, there has always been a strong subjective fighting spirit. Then, it is very clear that Hu Feng's so-called writer's subjective fighting spirit does not refer to the writer's "class stand," because firstly, those writers are not as Hu Feng said that they originally had the stand of the working class, but suddenly declined later; secondly, if it is a question of class stand, then it is impossible as Hu Feng said that it is only a problem of a part of the writers, but it is a common problem that generally exists among the writers from petty-bourgeois origin who have not been transformed. Did people like Lu Ling already have the stand of the working class at that time (even later)?

The problem is not in the noun, but in the substance. Of course, the writer has his subjective fighting spirit. Is there a writer in the world who does not have subjective fighting spirit? However, the subjective fighting spirit of any writer is first and foremost inseparable from his class stand. Reactionary fascist writers also have a strong "subjective fighting spirit," which is determined by their reactionary class stand. Writers with a firm working-class stand have the subjective fighting spirit to struggle for the cause of the working class, while writers standing on the petty-bourgeois stand, their subjective fighting spirit cannot but be petty-bourgeois, and they must stubbornly promote the views of the petty-bourgeois and demand that people transform the world according to the image of the petty-bourgeois. Therefore, for petty-bourgeois writers, their fundamental problem and primary problem is to transform their thinking and make themselves stand on the stand of the working class. However, Hu Feng requires them to have a "subjective fighting spirit" that has nothing to do with the class stand and transcends class relations. This kind of spirit cannot but seem to be innate. Here, Hu Feng obviously fell into the quagmire of idealism.

The actual effect of Hu Feng's theory is to hinder literary and artistic workers from recognizing the necessity of ideological transformation. Because according to Hu Feng, the fundamental problem of revolutionary literary and artistic workers is not to transform themselves to turn to the stand of the working class, but to strengthen the abstract and trans-class so-called subjective fighting spirit. This theory cannot solve any problems for the writers criticized by Hu Feng, but can only cause confusion. For the few writers belonging to his own small group who are praised by Hu Feng, this theory happens to defend their petty-bourgeois ideological stand, so that they regard that petty-bourgeois individualistic "subjective fighting spirit" as the revolutionary fighting spirit, and regard their situation of being detached from the masses as reasonable, and do not admit that they need to transform their thinking, and need to change from one class to another. Hu Feng's theory in fact plays such a role.

Ideological transformation of literary and artistic workers is carried out from two aspects, namely, learning Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and participating in the actual struggle of the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art that writers must study Marxism-Leninism and study society, and refuted the erroneous theory that Marxism-Leninism would destroy creative emotions. He said: "A revolutionary writer who calls himself a Marxist-Leninist, especially a Party member writer, must have common sense of Marxism-Leninism, but now some comrades lack the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism." Without studying Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to master the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to observe the world and observe society. However, Hu Feng regards revolutionary theory as cold and lifeless dogma. In all of Hu Feng's papers, he has never said that literary and artistic workers should study revolutionary theory. On the contrary, he only one-sidedly emphasizes the life practice he talks about, as if all problems will be solved as long as there is the life practice he talks about. In Hu Feng's view, one can grasp the true essence of historical reality without accepting revolutionary ideas (see the passage quoted earlier from "On the Road of Realism"). This is inseparable from Hu Feng's thought of despising the role of the world outlook. Here, Hu Feng again takes Lu Xun as an example, as if Lu Xun recognized reality completely from the intuitive experience of life, but completely ignores Lu Xun's painstaking study of Marxism-Leninism and the profound Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation he obtained as a result. It is this study and cultivation that essentially helped the great development of Mr. Lu Xun's later thoughts and creations.

In this way, it seems that Hu Feng attaches great importance to life practice. Is this really the case? Let's take a look at what Hu Feng understands as life practice.

Hu Feng believes that there is life everywhere, there are people everywhere, and the petty-bourgeois is also a member of the people, and is the vast majority of the people. He lumps all peasants into the petty-bourgeois class. He only sees that peasants are small private owners, but he does not see that they are more importantly laborers. What he sees in the peasants is almost only some feudal and backward things, in his terminology, a so-called "mental slavery trauma." He actually despises the peasants. This is another important source of errors in his literary thought. Among all kinds of petty-bourgeois, he particularly praises the intellectuals who belong to the petty-bourgeois category. He inappropriately and excessively emphasizes their consistent progressiveness and emphasizes their natural connection with the people. For our writers, what help can this theory give, and what problems can it solve? Isn't their shortcoming precisely the lack of close connection with the working people, and isn't it precisely the unfamiliarity with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that their thoughts and feelings and the objects they describe always cannot go beyond the narrow circle of the petty-bourgeois? Isn't what they urgently need to jump out of this narrow circle and go deep into the lives of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers? The people that revolutionary writers want to connect with are not any member of the people, such as the writer's own wife and friends, but the broad working people; the life that revolutionary writers need to delve into is not the life of any individual in any small room, but must first be the life of the broad working people. Hu Feng's deliberate mystification of the people and life is only to express his attempt to obliterate the difference between the few petty-bourgeois intellectuals and the broad working people, and to obliterate the difference between the lives of the two, which is precisely the logical result of his obliteration of the difference between bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literature and art and proletarian literature and art. Of course, in the Kuomintang-ruled area at that time, it was somewhat difficult for writers to connect with the working people, but it was not impossible to do so, and it could not be denied that writers had the necessity to do so. But Hu Feng's view is different. He said: "It is not necessarily that there is poetry after walking among the people who are moving forward. The people who are moving forward and any specific environment cannot be insulators." ("For Tomorrow" page 138) No matter what Hu Feng's motive was for saying these words at that time, this theory actually made those petty-bourgeois writers comfortable in their original narrow circle of life, rather than striving for various possibilities to go deep into the masses of workers and peasants. Hu Feng believes that our writers have long been closely combined with life, and the problem is only that writers will not absorb life. He has repeatedly quoted the words of a writer who has sacrificed, Dongping, to promote his point of view. Dongping said: "Chinese writers still say today that they have not recognized life and have not been related to life. I think this will inevitably be a kind of hippy and smiley attitude. In fact, Chinese writers (especially young ones) have long been closely integrated with life. The problem is that there are many brains that can dialectically absorb like magnets." The fact is not so. Our writers have not long been closely combined with life. On the contrary, they are generally detached from the life of the people, especially the life of the working people. And the ability of writers to absorb life can only be cultivated by constantly exercising in life for a long time. Without going deep into life, they can never absorb life. Dongping said: "How many dock workers, how many cooks on ships, how many vagrants were there in Russia at that time? Why did only one Gorky come out of them?" This is also obviously a one-sided view. Not all dock workers become Gorky, but Gorky's becoming Gorky is inseparable from the fact that he had been a dock worker and had experienced such a complex and rich life. It should be pointed out that these opinions of Dongping are one-sided, and therefore they are also wrong, and Hu Feng used these words of Dongping to promote his erroneous viewpoints.

Hu Feng is like this, when despising the role of revolutionary theory, he emphasizes life practice, and when he comes into contact with the relationship between writers and life, he actually makes writers comfortable in the existing circle of life with the argument that there is life everywhere and there are people everywhere, and denies that writers have the necessity to go deep into the workers and peasants and participate in actual struggles. This is Hu Feng's erroneous view of revolutionary theory and of life practice.

Because Hu Feng refused to use the Marxist method of class analysis to look at problems, serious errors also occurred in his view of the "May Fourth" literary and artistic movement. In his "On the Question of National Form," Hu Feng made the following evaluation of the "May Fourth" literary revolution movement: "The Chinese people's 'May Fourth' literary revolution movement, with the citizens as the leader, is a newly expanded tributary of the world's progressive literary and artistic tradition that has accumulated for hundreds of years after the rise of civil society." Here, Hu Feng clearly believes that the leaders of the "May Fourth" literary revolution movement were the bourgeoisie, and that this literary revolution belonged to a part of the world's bourgeois literature and art, and was a tributary of it. Hu Feng's view reflects his own deep bourgeois viewpoint. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in "On New Democracy" that the "May Fourth" new cultural revolution was led by proletarian thought, and it belonged to a part of the world's proletarian socialist cultural revolution. The literary revolution movement, as the main component of the "May Fourth" new cultural revolution, cannot be an exception. To say that the "May Fourth" literary revolution movement was led by proletarian thought does not mean that the "May Fourth" new literature was proletarian literature. Many of the main figures who participated in the literary revolution movement at that time were petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and their works were not written from the stand of the proletariat, but the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideas that were the basic spirit of the literary revolution were led by the proletariat. After the "May Fourth," the bourgeois cultural thought has lost its leading role, and the task of leading the cultural revolution of the people against imperialism and feudalism has had to fall on the shoulders of the proletariat.

Since Hu Feng believes that the "May Fourth" literary revolution movement was led by the bourgeoisie and belonged to a part of the world's bourgeois literature and art, and he is bowing down before the bourgeois literature and art, he cannot see the shortcomings of the "May Fourth" new literature and art, and regards the "May Fourth" literary and artistic tradition as completely correct without any criticism. This also shows what Hu Feng's class stand actually is. We believe that the "May Fourth" new literary and artistic movement was led by proletarian thought, and it played a great role in the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. However, the proletariat's leadership of literature and art also has its own history of development, and it is not that the leaders can realize and implement their leadership without struggle and without education, and make the led consciously accept the leadership. Therefore, although the main trend of the "May Fourth" new literature and art was revolutionary in opposing imperialism and feudalism, and although it was led by the proletariat, it was not without shortcomings and without serious shortcomings. For example, the ranks of this new literature and art were mainly composed of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, who tended to be revolutionary and sympathized with the workers and peasants, but at the same time had the serious shortcomings of being detached from the masses of workers and peasants. To inherit and develop the "May Fourth" new literary and artistic tradition, it is obvious that we cannot inherit even this serious shortcoming, and it is obvious that we should not let literature and art always remain in the small circle of a few intellectuals as it was at that time, but should be closely integrated with the masses of workers and peasants. Hu Feng's error is that he made a bourgeois judgment on the "May Fourth" new literature and art, and thus denied that it still had the serious shortcomings of being detached from the masses of the people. This viewpoint is of course inseparable from his viewpoint of denying that the new literature and art and literary and artistic workers need to be transformed.

Another serious error of Hu Feng is that he completely severed the new literature and art since the "May Fourth" from the national literary and artistic tradition. He said: "The new literary and artistic requirements and the forms that existed before it are completely different in the sudden 'leap' ... It requires transferring forms (and methods) from other nations with similar social foundations." That is to say, the new literary and artistic forms since the "May Fourth" were completely transferred from foreign countries and had nothing to do with the literary and artistic forms of their own nation. Hu Feng also believes that this is a completely correct, reasonable, and should be the case. It must be pointed out that the "May Fourth" new literature and art opposed the classical Chinese language and opposed feudal ideas and feudal literature, and made great contributions. However, because "many of the leading figures at that time did not have the critical spirit of Marxism, and the methods they used were generally the methods of the bourgeoisie, that is, the methods of formalism ... They did not have the dialectical materialism and historical materialism critical spirit for the status quo, for history, and for foreign things. Bad is absolutely bad, everything is bad; good is absolutely good, everything is good. This method of looking at problems formalistically affected the development of this movement (referring to the "May Fourth" movement - translator)." (Mao Zedong: "Oppose Party Eight-legged Essays") Expressed in the new literature and art, it is that in order to oppose the old literature and art, there has been a tendency to blindly deny the national literary and artistic tradition. This is one of the shortcomings of some authors and works in the "May Fourth" new literary and artistic movement. This shortcoming, when developed, made some works in the new literature and art after the "May Fourth" detached from the national form and lacked "fresh, lively, and Chinese style and Chinese spirit that are loved by the Chinese people." (Mao Zedong: "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War") This situation also expanded the distance between the new literature and art and the broad working people. But despite this, the new literature and art since the "May Fourth" is by no means as Hu Feng said that there is no inherited relationship with the national literary and artistic tradition. The "May Fourth" new cultural movement itself occurred on the national basis. It was precisely the "May Fourth" new literary and artistic movement that liberated the excellent works and writers with democratic colors in Chinese history, from Dream of the Red Chamber, The Scholars, Water Margin, The Romance of the West Chamber to Du Fu, Qu Yuan, The Book of Songs, from the long-term feudal oppression and distortion, and gained new meaning, new life, and new connection with the people in literature. Mr. Lu Xun, the representative of the revolutionary new literature and art, not only accepted the influence of foreign progressive literature, but also inherited and developed the characteristics of his own national literary and artistic heritage. He not only theoretically advocated that the national form of literature and art can be produced in the adoption of old forms, but also diligently devoted himself to the research, sorting out, and publishing work of our country's literary, artistic, and other national heritages, and called on young literary and artistic workers to learn from these heritages. From the language, structure, and expression methods of his own works, it can be seen that he is the best in inheriting and developing the characteristics of the national literary tradition. Hu Feng described Mr. Lu Xun as if he was a denier of national heritage in "On the Question of National Form," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. This is not only arbitrary, but simply an insult to Mr. Lu Xun. Contrary to Mr. Lu Xun, what is still preserved today by those

    胡风的反马克思主义的文艺思想
    林默涵
    编者按：一九五二年六月八日本报转载舒芜的“从头学习‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’”时，曾在编者按语中指出胡风及其小集团的文艺思想“是一种实质上属于资产阶级、小资产阶级的个人主义的文艺思想”。这种文艺思想，因为在一些“左”的、“马列主义”的词句掩盖之下，对于部分小资产阶级知识分子就有迷惑的作用，因此，必须从根本上加以批判。林默涵同志的“胡风的反马克思主义的文艺思想”一文（原载本年第二期“文艺报”），从一些基本问题上揭露了胡风的文艺思想的实质，指出这种文艺思想与马克思列宁主义——毛泽东文艺思想的根本区别，这是有助于目前文艺思想工作的开展的。现将此文转载于此，以供文艺工作者的参考和研究。
    对于胡风的错误的文艺思想，曾经有好些同志提出过批评。去年六月八日“人民日报”在转载舒芜的检讨文章“从头学习‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’”时，也曾在编者按语中明确而扼要地指出胡风及其小集团的文艺思想的错误性质，认为“是一种实质上属于资产阶级、小资产阶级的个人主义的文艺思想”。但这些批评，还没有引起胡风去正视和检讨自己的错误。为了帮助胡风认识自己的错误思想，不久以前，曾由一部分同志和胡风举行过几次座谈会，讨论他的文艺思想；经过这几次座谈会，胡风虽然开始在个别问题上作了一些检讨，但在根本问题上，仍然没有彻底认识自己的错误观点。
    在批评胡风的文艺思想之前，应该说明：胡风曾经长期在国民党统治区从事文艺活动，在政治上他是站在进步方面，对国民党反动的法西斯文化作过斗争。在这方面，胡风有他的贡献。他的文艺思想，也不是全部错误的，在某些个别的问题上，也含有正确的成分。但个别问题上的某些正确看法，并不能改变他的文艺思想的根本性质的错误。胡风的文艺思想，在实质上是反马克思主义的，是和毛泽东同志所指示的文艺方针背道而驰的。但胡风却一贯地以马克思主义的文艺理论家自居，一贯地认为他的文艺思想是符合毛泽东同志的文艺方针的。正因为这样，他的经常用了马克思主义的言词装饰起来的错误的文艺思想，在一部分人中间就起了若干的迷惑作用。同时，这种文艺思想，虽然不是很普遍，但在其他文艺工作者中间也是可能存在的。因此，弄清楚胡风的文艺思想的实质，指出这种文艺思想的根本性质的错误所在，在今天仍有必要。
    我们的批评，打算着重于毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后的胡风的文艺理论，因为从这里可以明显地看出胡风的文艺思想和毛泽东同志的文艺方针的根本区别。但是胡风的错误的文艺思想，是有其一贯的根源的，是一直发展下来的，因此，也就不能不远溯到“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以前的胡风的某些论文。
        ×    ×    ×
    胡风文艺思想的错误根源，是在于他一贯采取了非阶级的观点来对待文艺问题。他不是从阶级的根源去考察各种文艺的现象，而是离开了阶级关系去寻求文艺现象的原因。可是，在阶级社会中，离开了阶级观点，就不可避免地会使自己陷于错误。
    胡风的这一错误，显著地表现在他对于现实主义的看法上。胡风是一向以现实主义的坚持者和保护者自任的，但是，胡风所理解的现实主义是什么样的现实主义呢？在他的理论中，旧现实主义和社会主义的现实主义并没有什么根本的区别。在胡风看来，现实主义的根本问题是什么呢？那就是他所一贯地主张的所谓作家的“主观战斗精神”和这种“主观战斗精神”与客观现实的结合。照他看来，作家的“主观战斗精神”的强弱或有无，就是现实主义的强弱或有无的标志。这里，第一，胡风片面地不适当地强调所谓“主观战斗精神”，而没有强调更重要地忠实于现实，这根本上就是反现实主义的；第二，胡风所说的“主观战斗精神”是没有阶级内容的抽象的东西，因而他所说的现实主义也就只是一种没有阶级内容的抽象的东西。但是，这样的现实主义实际上是不存在的。在阶级社会里，无论怎样的现实主义都有它的阶级性的。离开了阶级的观点和离开了现实主义在各时代中的历史具体性，必然不能正确地了解现实主义。现实主义的根本问题，决不是如胡风所说的那种抽象的“主观战斗精神”，因为任何作家都有他的某一种性质和某一种程度的“主观战斗精神”，而这种“主观战斗精神”，首先是由他的阶级立场所决定的。旧现实主义，例如批判的现实主义，由于它能够正视和批判当时的现实，揭露资产阶级的缺点和丑恶，这种现实主义有很大的进步作用，但它的反映现实和批判现实，却不能不受它所依据的阶级立场和世界观所限制，因此不可能充分反映工人阶级和劳动人民的斗争。显然地，这不是什么作家的“主观战斗精神”问题，而首先是作家的阶级立场问题。同样，对于社会主义的现实主义者，根本问题也不是有没有抽象的“主观战斗精神”，而是首先要具有工人阶级的立场和共产主义的世界观；没有这种立场和世界观，那就不管你的“主观战斗精神”怎样强烈，也不可能正确地充分地反映今天的现实。胡风的错误，就是始终离开阶级的观点，看不到各种不同的现实主义的阶级性，因此也就看不到旧现实主义和社会主义现实主义的根本区别。
    这种思想，在他的“略论文学无门”一文中，表现得很明白：
    如果一个作家忠实于艺术，呕心镂骨地努力寻求最无
    伪的、最有生命的、最能够说出他所要把捉的生活内容
    的表现形式，那么，即使他像志贺（志贺直哉，日本的一
    位旧现实主义作家——引者注）似地没有经过大的生活
    波涛，他的作品也能够达到高度的艺术的真实。因为，
    作者苦心孤诣地追求着和自己的身心的感应融然无间的
    表现的时候，同时也就是追求人生，这追求的结果是作者
    和人生的拥合，同时也就是人生和艺术的拥合了。这是
    作家的本质的态度问题，绝对不是锤字炼句的功夫所能够达到的。如果用抽象的话说，那就是，真实的现实主义的创作方法，能够补足作家的生活经验上的不足和世界观上的缺陷。（“密云期风习小记”第九十九页）这是胡风在一九三七年说的话，但这个观点，胡风在后来并没有改变。在这里，胡风把所谓忠实于艺术看成是绝对的东西，认为作家只要忠实于艺术，就“能够达到高度的艺术的真实”，既不问作家的阶级立场，也不问他是忠实于什么阶级的艺术。胡风完全忽视了作家的阶级立场对于他的艺术活动的影响。他认为作家只要忠实于艺术，不需要有什么进步的政治思想和进步的世界观。这正是资产阶级的虚伪的艺术理论。现实主义的创作方法可以补足作家世界观上的缺陷，只能是对于不能有正确的世界观的旧现实主义者而言。旧现实主义者中间，有以现实主义的创作方法而补救了世界观的缺陷的例子，如巴尔扎克就是（巴尔扎克当然是必须学习的，但我们必须记住，即使是巴尔扎克，也因世界观的缺陷而限制了他对现实的认识，更没有成为也不可能成为社会主义的现实主义者）；但更有因反动的世界观而损害了现实主义、损害了艺术的多到不可计数的例子。对于今天的社会主义现实主义者，如果还把世界观和创作方法分开来看，甚至抛开世界观，那就是不可想像的事情了。社会主义现实主义本身就要求艺术描写的真实性和历史的具体性必须和以社会主义的精神在思想上教育人民的任务相结合，那么，没有进步的世界观和社会主义的意识，又怎么能成为社会主义的现实主义者呢？对于社会主义现实主义者，创作方法和世界观是不可能分裂而只能是一元的。但在胡风的“理论”中，资产阶级小资产阶级的批判的现实主义和社会主义现实主义却始终混淆不清，因为他始终想以资产阶级小资产阶级的文艺和文艺理论来偷换无产阶级的文艺和文艺理论。
    把旧现实主义和社会主义现实主义加以混淆，不是批判地学习和继承旧现实主义，而是把旧现实主义看成等于社会主义现实主义，其实质就是否认作家的世界观的作用，否认革命的作家必须取得革命的阶级立场；自然也就是否认文学艺术中的党性的原则。从这样的错误观点出发，胡风就不能不在许多问题上犯了一连串的错误。
                ×    ×    ×
    毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中明确地指出：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。过去有些同志间的争论、纷歧、对立、不团结，并不是在这个根本的原则的问题上，而是在一些比较次要的甚至是无原则的问题上。而对于这个原则问题，争论的双方倒是没有什么纷歧，倒是几乎一致的，都有某种程度的轻视工农兵、脱离群众的倾向，我说某种程度，因为一般地说，这些同志的轻视工农兵、脱离群众，与国民党的轻视工农兵、脱离群众，是不同的，但是无论如何，这个倾向是有的，这个根本问题不解决，其他许多问题也就不易解决。……鲁迅曾说：革命文艺战线的不统一是因为缺乏共同的目的，而这个共同目的就是为工农。这个问题那时上海有，现在重庆也有，在那些地方，这个问题很难彻底解决，因为那些地方有人压迫革命文艺家，不让他们有到工农兵群众中去的自由。”　这就是革命文艺工作者中一直存在的根本问题。要解决这个问题，只有使文艺工作者到工农兵群众中去，参加工农兵群众的实际斗争，从轻视工农兵变为喜爱工农兵，从脱离群众变为接近群众。一句话，就是文艺工作者必须改造思想，改变立场，把立场从小资产阶级方面移到工农兵方面来。当然，这个问题，在当时的国民党统治区是不容易解决，或不容易彻底解决的，但是不能因为解决这个问题时有许多困难，就不承认这是根本问题。
    但是，胡风的看法不是这样。胡风也认为在革命文艺中存在着缺点，这就是他所指斥的所谓主观公式主义和客观主义的倾向。什么是主观公式主义和客观主义呢？按照胡风的说法，现实主义就是作家的主观战斗精神和客观现实的“拥抱”或结合，主观战斗精神和客观现实的脱节，就产生了或者是缺乏客观现实的主观公式主义，或者是缺乏主观战斗精神的客观主义。他认为，客观主义是抗战时期国民党统治区文艺创作中的主要倾向，克服这种倾向的办法，就是加强作家的主观战斗精神。在当时的国民党统治区是否存在着如胡风所指斥的那些倾向呢？我们不打算在这里来讨论这个问题。但我们却在这里看到了对于革命文艺的根本问题的两种答案：依照“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的指示，根本问题是文艺工作者缺乏为工农兵的共同目标，是轻视工农兵，脱离群众；解决的办法，是深入群众，是改造自己的思想。依照胡风的理论，根本问题，是作家主观战斗精神不够强烈或者衰落了，解决的办法是加强作家的主观战斗精神。两个答案，那一个正确呢？显然，错误的是胡风。这种理论的错误，就在于它不承认我们的文艺的根本问题是为工农兵的问题，由此也就否认文艺工作者的根本问题是思想改造，是由一个阶级变为另一个阶级的问题；相反地，却抽象地要求作家去加强所谓主观战斗精神，不是首先改造作家的主观，而是加强他们的主观。显然地，这是一个原则性的分歧。
    毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中尖锐地说明了小资产阶级作家为什么必须改造思想，因为
    “小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。”而依了他们，“实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。”所以“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”但是，胡风不但不承认这种思想改造的极端重要的原则意义，相反地，在他的论文中倒是用了很多的篇幅来为小资产阶级知识分子作辩护，他看不见或者不承认小资产阶级知识分子普遍存在着轻视工农、脱离群众的毛病，却过分地强调“他们在生活上和劳苦人民原就有过或有着某种联系”，
    “他们和先进的人民原就有过或有着各种状态的结合”（“论现实主义的路”）。由此，胡风就得出了这样的结论：
    就是还没有接受这个革命思想，在被这个革命思想所
    引导的斗争发生之前，在某一关联上和人民有着联系的
    知识分子作家，由于对实际的“观察”，即鲁迅所说的
    “由于事实的教训”，虽然更为艰难，但依然有可能在
    相应的程度上进入人民的内容，汲取人民的要求流在自
    己身里，因而把握到历史现实的真实的本质的。“一部
    文学史”就提供了丰富的例证，鲁迅就是这样在中国历
    史上站了出来的。因为，革命思想正是提升了历史现实
    的内容所形成的，否则，世界上就不会有什么历史唯物
    论，也不会有什么现实主义了。（“论现实主义的路”
    第八十页）
    这一段话的意思很明白，就是认为小资产阶级知识分子作家，可以不必改造思想，现实主义可以不需要革命的立场和世界观。胡风的这种说法是对于
    “文学史”的片面的、错误的解释。诚然，文学史上确有些伟大作家，虽然没有正确的革命思想，但由于他能正视现实的原故，他能够在某种程度，甚至在很大程度内写出了历史的真实。但是，一定的思想限度终究使他不可能完全地“把握到历史现实的真实的本质”。在这种情形下，作家就往往不能不陷入一种矛盾，这种矛盾会随着这个作家愈深入到现实中而愈强烈起来。对于某些作家，如果不能解决这个矛盾（由于历史原因或其他原因），这种矛盾的激化甚至会形成一种生活和创作上的危机。而对于现代的另一些作家，如果他能够解决这个矛盾，那就是说如果能够进一步突破原来的思想限制，取得无产阶级的革命思想，那就能使自己的创作大大地前进一步，以至能够真正“把握到历史现实的真实的本质”。鲁迅就是一个最好的例子，他并不是一开始就是社会主义现实主义者，正和他在思想上并不是一开始就是马克思主义者一样；他由进化论进到阶级论，由绅士阶级的逆子贰臣进到无产阶级的友人和战士，与此相应，在文学上他是由批判的现实主义进到社会主义的现实主义的。这中间，鲁迅显然经历过一个深刻的自我思想改造的过程。鲁迅自己就曾经不止一次地叙述过他这一思想转变的经过情况。而胡风却始终不承认鲁迅在思想上经历过这样一个飞跃的变化，其实际用意，无非企图证明小资产阶级知识分子作家本来就在人民中，用不着经过什么思想改造，用不着站到工人阶级的立场上去。
    也许胡风会说：“我讲的作家的主观战斗精神，就是指的作家的阶级立场。不过，因为在国民党统治区，不能明说，只好使用这种‘奴隶的语言’罢了。”实际上，胡风在他的一九五一年出版的“论现实主义的路”一书中，已经把“主观战斗精神”改为“主观的思想立场”了，他说：“中心点是争取主观的思想立场或思想要求的加强。”但是，事物的实质并不会因为换了一个名称而变化，胡风的所谓
    “主观战斗精神”并不是“阶级立场”的代名词，这在他的“文艺工作的发展及其努力方向”一文中表现得很明白，要掉包是很困难的。
    在这篇文章中，胡风分析抗战爆发后创作上的特征，认为是“主观精神的高扬和客观精神的泛滥分离地同时发展”“如果这两种精神不是分离地，而是彼此融合，彼此渗透，一定能够产生真的艺术生命；事实上，当时已有个别的作家做到了，现在正有少数的作家在艰苦地努力。”可是，由于“战争变成了持续的日常生活，文艺家就要在经营一种日常生活的情况下从事创作，或者为了从事创作而勉力地经营一种日常生活。……这就有了被这种日常生活包围、疲乏、腐蚀、俘虏的可能。……结果当然会引起主观战斗精神的衰落，主观战斗精神的衰落同时也就是对于客观现实的把捉力、拥抱力、突击力的衰落。”（“逆流的日子”第二、四、七、八页）
    这就是说，文艺家的主观战斗精神本来是很强烈的，只是后来衰落了，而衰落的原因是由于战争变成了持续的日常生活，作家受了这种沉滞的日常生活的包围和俘虏。在这一部分作家中，就产生了被胡风所指斥为具有客观主义倾向的作品。而在另一部分作家中，具体地说，就是胡风所赞扬的如路翎等人的身上，则是一直有着强烈的主观战斗精神的。那么，这就很明白了，胡风的所谓作家的主观战斗精神并不是指的作家的“阶级立场”，因为第
    一、那些作家们，并不是如胡风所说的本来有了工人阶级的立场，而后来忽然衰落了的；第二、如果是阶级立场问题，那就不可能如胡风所说的，仅是一部分作家的问题，而是在未经改造的小资产阶级出身的作家中普遍存在的共同的问题，难道像路翎等人在当时（甚至在后来），就已经有工人阶级的立场了吗？
    问题不在名词，而在实质。作家当然有他的主观战斗精神，世界上难道有一种没有主观战斗精神的作家吗？但是，任何作家的主观战斗精神，首先就是和他的阶级立场分不开的。反动的法西斯主义作家也有强烈的“主观战斗精神”，那是由他们的反动的阶级立场所决定的。具有坚定的工人阶级立场的作家，就有为工人阶级的事业奋斗的主观战斗精神，而站在小资产阶级立场的作家，他的主观战斗精神就不能不是小资产阶级的，就必然是顽强地宣传小资产阶级的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级的面貌来改造世界。因此，对于小资产阶级作家，他们的根本问题和首要问题，是改造思想，使自己站到工人阶级的立场上来。而胡风却要求他们具有一种和阶级立场无关的超越于阶级关系之上的“主观战斗精神”，这种精神就不能不好像是天生的东西了。在这里，胡风就显然陷进了唯心主义的泥潭。
                ×    ×    ×
    胡风这种理论的实际效果，就是阻碍文艺工作者认识思想改造的必要性。因为依照胡风看来，革命的文艺工作者的根本问题，不是改造自己，以转入工人阶级的立场，而是加强那种抽象的超阶级的所谓主观战斗精神。这种理论，对于胡风所指责的作家，不能解决任何问题，而只能引起混乱。对于胡风所赞扬的属于他自己那一个小集团的少数作家，这种理论就恰好为他们的小资产阶级的思想立场辩护，使他们把那种小资产阶级的个人主义的“主观战斗精神”看成就是革命的战斗精神，把自己脱离群众的状况视为合理，而不承认需要改造自己的思想，需要由一个阶级变为另一个阶级。胡风的理论事实上正是起了这样的作用。
    文艺工作者改造思想，不外是从两个方面来进行，即学习马克思列宁主义革命理论和参加群众的实际斗争。毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上指出，作家必须学习马克思列宁主义和学习社会，并且驳斥了那种认为马克思列宁主义会破坏创作情绪的错误理论。他说：“一个自命为马列主义的革命作家，尤其是党员作家，必须有马列主义常识，但是现在有些同志，却缺少马列主义的基本观点。”不学习马克思列宁主义，就不可能掌握辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点去观察世界，观察社会。但是，胡风却把革命理论一概看成是冷冰冰的教条。在胡风的全部论文中，从来没有说过文艺工作者应该学习革命理论，相反地，只是片面地强调他所说的生活实践，仿佛只要有了他所说的生活实践就一切问题都解决了。在胡风看来，不接受革命思想，也可以把握到历史现实的真实本质（见前引“论现实主义的路”里面的一段话）。这和胡风的轻视世界观的作用的思想是分不开的。在这里，胡风又以鲁迅为例子，仿佛鲁迅是完全从生活的直觉经验去认识现实似的，却完全抹煞鲁迅对于马克思列宁主义的刻苦学习和因此而得到的深刻的马克思列宁主义理论修养，正是这种学习和修养，从本质上帮助了鲁迅先生后期的思想和创作的伟大发展。
    这样看来，仿佛胡风是很重视生活实践的了，果真如此吗？让我们来看看胡风所理解的生活实践又是什么吧。
    胡风认为到处都有生活，到处都有人民，小资产阶级也是人民的一分子，并且是人民中的绝大多数。他把农民笼统地都算作小资产阶级，他只看到农民是小私有者，而没有看到更主要的他们是劳动者，他在农民身上所看到的，几乎只是一些封建的落后的东西，用他的术语来说，就是一种所谓“精神奴役创伤”的东西。他对农民实际上是轻视的，这是他的文艺思想错误的又一重要根源。在各种小资产阶级中，他特别颂扬的是属于小资产阶级范畴的知识分子，他不适当地过分地强调他们的一贯的进步性，强调他们和人民的天然联系。对于我们的作家来说，这种理论能有什么帮助，能解决什么问题呢？难道他们的缺点不正是缺乏和劳动人民的密切联系，不正是不熟悉工农兵的生活，因此，他们的思想感情和他们所描写的对象，都始终越不出小资产阶级的狭隘圈子吗？难道对于他们，迫切需要的不是跳出这个狭隘的圈子，而深入到工农兵群众生活中去吗？革命作家所要联系的人民，并不是人民中间的任何一分子，例如作家自己的妻子朋友，而是广大的劳动人民；革命作家所需要深入的生活，并不是任何小房间里任何个人的生活，而必须首先是广大的劳动人民的生活。胡风对于人民和生活的这种故弄玄虚，不过是表示他企图抹煞少数小资产阶级知识分子和广大劳动人民两者之间的区别，抹煞两者的生活之间的区别，而这正是他抹煞资产阶级小资产阶级文艺和无产阶级文艺的区别的逻辑的结果。当然，在当时国民党的统治区域，作家要联系劳动人民是有某些困难的，但并不是不可能做，更不能否认作家有这样做的必要。但胡风的看法不同，他说：“并不一定是走在前进的人民中间了以后才有诗，前进的人民和任何具体的环境也不能够是绝缘体。”（“为了明天”一三八页）不管胡风当时说这些话的动机如何，这种理论，实际上是使那些小资产阶级作家安于原来狭小的生活圈子，而不是争取各种可能深入到工农群众中去。胡风认为我们的作家早就和生活紧紧结合了，问题仅是作家不会吸取生活。他不止一次地引用一位已经牺牲的作家东平的话来宣传他的这种论点。东平说：“中国的作家直到今天还说自己没有认识生活，没有和生活发生关系，我觉得这将不免是一类嘻皮笑脸的态度。其实，中国作家（尤其是年青的）早就和生活紧紧配合了，问题是缺少许多像磁石一般能够辩证法地去吸收的脑子。”事实不是如此，我们的作家并没有早就和生活紧紧结合，相反地，是普遍地脱离人民群众的生活，特别是劳动人民的生活。而作家吸取生活的能力，只有长期在生活中不断地锻炼才能养成，不深入生活，就永远不能够吸取生活。东平说：“俄罗斯当时有多少码头工人，多少船上伙夫，多少流浪子，为什么在这之中只出了一个高尔基？”这也显然是片面的看法，并不是所有码头工人都成为高尔基，但高尔基之成为高尔基，和他曾经做过码头工人，曾经经历过那样复杂丰富的生活是分不开的。应该指出，东平的这些意见是片面的，因而也就是错误的，而胡风就利用了东平的这些话来宣传他的错误观点。
    胡风就是这样地，在轻视革命理论的作用时，强调生活实践，在接触到作家和生活的关系时，又以所谓到处都有生活，到处都有人民的论调，来实际上使作家安于现有的生活圈子，否认作家有深入工农、参加实际斗争的必要。这就是胡风对于革命理论和对于生活实践的错误看法。
            ×    ×    ×
    由于胡风拒绝用马克思主义的阶级分析的方法去看问题，因此，在对于“五四”文艺运动的看法上，也就产生了严重的错误。在他的“论民族形式问题”一书中，胡风对“五四”文学革命运动作了这样的估计：“以市民为盟主的中国人民大众底五·四文学革命运动，正是市民社会突起了以后的、累积了几百年的、世界进步文艺传统底一个新拓的支流。”这里，胡风显然认为“五四”文学革命运动的领导者是资产阶级，而且这个文学革命是属于世界资产阶级文艺的一部分，是它的一个支流。胡风的这
    一看法反映了他自己的深刻的资产阶级观点。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中明确地指出“五四”新文化革命是无产阶级思想所领导的，它是属于世界无产阶级社会主义文化革命的一部分。作为“五四”新文化革命的主要构成部分的文学革命运动也不能是例外。说“五四”文学革命运动是无产阶级思想领导的，并不是说“五四”新文学就是无产阶级文学。参加当时的文学革命运动的许多主要人物，是小资产阶级知识分子，他们的作品也并不是站在无产阶级的立场上写作的，但作为文学革命的基本精神的反帝反封建的思想，是为无产阶级所领导的。在“五四”以后，资产阶级的文化思想，已经丧失领导作用，领导人民大众反帝反封建的文化革命的担子，已不得不落在无产阶级的肩上了。
    胡风既然认为“五四”文学革命运动是资产阶级领导的，是属于世界资产阶级文艺的一部分，而他是拜倒于资产阶级文艺之前的，因此他就看不到
    “五四”新文艺所具有的缺点，而毫无批判地把
    “五四”文艺传统看成是完全正确的。这也就表现了胡风的阶级立场实际上是什么了。我们认为，“五四”新文艺运动，是无产阶级思想领导的，它在中国人民反帝反封建的斗争中，起了伟大的作用。但是无产阶级对于文艺的领导，它本身也有它的发展的历史，并不是不需要斗争、不需要教育，领导者就可以实现和贯彻自己的领导，并使被领导者自觉地接受领导。因此，“五四”新文艺的主潮在反对帝国主义封建主义这一点上虽然是革命的，虽然是受无产阶级领导的，但并不是因此而没有缺点，没有严重的缺点。例如，这个新文艺的队伍，主要是由小资产阶级知识分子构成的，他们倾向革命，同情工农大众，但同时又具有脱离工农群众的严重缺点。要继承和发展“五四”新文艺传统，显然不能连这种严重缺点也继承下来，显然不能让文艺始终像当时一样停留在少数知识分子的小圈子里，而应该和工农大众密切结合。胡风的错误，就是对“五四”新文艺作了资产阶级的武断，因而否认它还有和人民群众脱离的严重缺点。这个观点，当然是和他否认新文艺和文艺工作者需要进行改造的观点分不开的。
    胡风的另一严重错误，是把“五四”以来的新文艺和民族的文艺传统完全割断。他说：“新的文艺要求和先它存在的形式截然异质的突起的‘飞跃’，……它要求从社会基础相类似的其他民族移入形式
    （以及方法）。”这就是说，“五四”以来的新文艺形式，是完全从外国移入而和自己民族的文艺形式截然无关的。胡风并且认为这是完全正确的、合理的、应该如此的事情。必须指出，“五四”新文艺反对了文言文，反对了封建思想和封建文学，有伟大的功绩。但由于“许多那时的领导人物，还没有马克思主义的批判精神，他们使用的方法，一般地还是资产阶级的方法即形式主义的方法。……他们对于现状，对于历史，对于外国事物，没有辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的批判精神，坏就是绝对的坏，一切皆坏；好就是绝对的好，一切皆好。这种形式主义地看问题的方法，就影响了后来这个运动（指“五四”运动——引者）的发展。”（毛泽东：“反对党八股”）表现在新文艺方面，就是为了要反对旧文艺，却产生了一种盲目否定民族文艺传统的偏向。这正是“五四”新文艺运动中一部分作者和作品的缺点之一。这个缺点，发展起来，就使“五四”以后新文艺中的有些作品脱离了民族的形式，缺乏
    “新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派。”（毛泽东：“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）这种情况，同时也扩大了新文艺和广大劳动人民的距离。但尽管如此，“五四”以来的新文艺却绝不是如胡风所说，和民族的文艺传统完全没有继承关系的。“五四”新文化运动本身，就是在民族基础上发生的。正是“五四”新文艺运动，使中国历史上优秀的有民主色彩的作品和作家，从红楼梦、儒林外史、水浒、西厢记到杜甫、屈原、诗经，解脱了长期的封建主义的压制和歪曲，在文学上得到了新的意义，新的生命，和人民的新的联系。革命的新文艺的代表者鲁迅先生，就是一方面接受了外国进步文学的影响，同时又继承和发展了自己民族文艺遗产的。他不但在理论上主张在旧形式的采用中可以产生文艺的民族形式，而且曾勤劳地致力于对我国文学和美术等等民族遗产的研究、整理和出版工作，号召青年文艺工作者向这些遗产学习。从他自己的作品的语言、结构和表现方法，更可以看出他是最好地继承并且发扬了民族文学传统的特色的。胡风在“论民族形式问题”中，把鲁迅先生描写为仿佛是民族遗产的否定者，这是完全不合事实的。这不仅是武断，简直是对于鲁迅先生的
    一种侮辱。和鲁迅先生相反，那些拒绝民族遗产、主张“全盘西化”的人物和他们的作品，在今天还有什么保留下来的呢？它们早已被人民忘记得干干净净了。因为他们的作品没有民族的特色，人民是不喜欢的。一个不敬爱自己的民族、不尊重自己的民族遗产的人，也不可能得到人民的敬爱和尊重的。
    胡风自己却正是民族遗产的极端否定者。由于他缺乏阶级分析的观点，对于民族文艺传统也就不可能有正确的认识。在“论民族形式问题”一书中，胡风用了很多的篇幅来攻击民间文艺，不加分析地把民间文艺一概看成封建文艺，他的公式是民间文艺等于封建文艺，包括“水浒”在内，在他看来，都没有丝毫的革命性民主性，“甚至略略带有民主主义观点的要素的反映也很难被我们发现”。这是完全违反马克思列宁主义对于民族文化的观点的。列宁说过：“在每一个民族文化里面，都有着即使是没有发展出来的民主主义和社会主义的文化的成分；因为在每一个民族里面，都有劳动和被剥削的群众，这些群众的生活条件，不可避免地会滋生出民主主义和社会主义的意识形态来。”毛泽东同志也说过：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”（“新民主主义论”）胡风的错误，就是不了解在阶级社会中存在着两种不同的文化，看不到劳动人民的革命要求必然通过种种方式——正面地或者曲折地在文艺中反映出来。这是一种对于人民、对于民族文化的虚无主义的观点。
    斯大林同志指示我们：“每一个民族，不论大小，都有它自己的根本特性，都有那种只能为它所有而为其他民族所无的特色。这些特性乃是每一个民族带到共同的世界文化宝库中使之充实及丰富起来的贡献。”又说：“社会主义内容的无产阶级文化，在各个不同的、埋头进行社会主义建设的民族那里，是随着语言及生活等的不同而采取各不相同的表现形式与表现方法的，……无产阶级文化不取消民族文化，而是给它以内容。反过来说，民族文化也不取消无产阶级文化，而是给它以形式。”胡风机械地理解“内容决定形式”这一命题，认为相同的内容只能有相同的形式，因此以人民民主革命为内容的中国新文艺，只能从所谓其他“先进国”
    （指资本主义国家——引者）移入文艺形式，却不能从自己的民族遗产中去继承和接受文艺形式。这是一种抹煞民族特性的世界主义的思想。苏联各民族的文学，就社会主义内容这一点说是统一的，但每个民族的文学各有其不同的民族形式，形式的不同，并不妨害内容的统一，相反地，是使内容更丰富、更充实。依照胡风的理论，这岂不是不可思议的事情吗！
    胡风的这一错误，是由于他不能正确地理解作为上层建筑的文学艺术以及其他意识形态的发展的特点。因为由经济基础所产生的上层建筑是随着基础一同消失、更替的缘故，便认为过去各个历史时代所创造出来的一切宝贵遗产都会灭亡，或者都不适用于今天了。这是割断历史传统的错误理论。“恩格斯早就解释过，意识形态的上层建筑不是由新经济、新的基础完全从新创造出来，因为不论是文学、艺术或是哲学等等，都不能够在光秃的地面上发生。它们是在旧社会范围内所已造成的思想材料和观念的基础上产生出来的。起而代替旧基础之新的经济基础，只是规定着适合于这一基础的利益与需要之意识形态的新的发展方向。”（尤金：“关于语言学问题的著作对于社会科学发展的意义”）起来代替反动旧阶级的先进的工人阶级，仍然继承着和发展着自己民族的文化遗产中最可宝贵的东西，他们和无祖无宗的资产阶级世界主义者相反，是人类文化所创造出来的一切优良成果的最合法的继承者和保护者。

    以上所说，就是胡风文艺思想的主要错误。
    很明显，胡风的文艺思想，正如“人民日报”的编者按语所指出的，是一种实质上属于资产阶级、小资产阶级个人主义的文艺思想，它和马克思主义的文艺思想、和毛泽东同志的文艺方针没有任何的相同点；相反地，是反马克思主义的、反社会主义现实主义的。
    以这种错误的文艺思想为中心，在胡风周围曾结成了一个文艺上的小集团。这个小集团的特点就是严重地脱离政治、脱离群众，而醉心于他们的自我欣赏和互相标榜。我们说这是一个文艺上的小集团，并不是说他们有什么严密的组织，不，这只是一种思想倾向上的结合。他们的小集团作风的表现，是在于他们的强烈的排外性，凡是跟他们不同的意见，不论来自何方，都加以排斥和打击。自我批评对他们是根本不适用的。把自己一小伙人的利益，看成最高的利益。这不是小集团是什么呢？而这种小集团的形成，正如毛泽东同志所指出的，是因为他们脱离了群众，缺乏一个不是在口头上、而是在实际上为工农服务的目的。
    解放以后，胡风写了一些较好的通讯报告，虽然其中流露的思想意识还有不健康的地方，但也起了
    一定的积极作用，这是值得欢迎的。可是，对于他的错误的文艺思想，虽然我们曾经期待而且帮助他、由他自己来彻底认识和检讨，却直到今天还没有什么动静。为了帮助他和受他影响的一小群人脱离错误，我写了这一篇文章，希望能得到文艺工作者的指正。（一月十九日写完）
