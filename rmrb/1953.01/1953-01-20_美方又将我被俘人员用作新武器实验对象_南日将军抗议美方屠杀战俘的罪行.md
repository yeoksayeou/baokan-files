    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th] The U.S. side has once again blatantly used our captured personnel as experimental subjects for new weapons. According to the U.S. announcement, on January 13th, the U.S. side attempted to capture and mistreat a prisoner of war in Prisoner of War Camp No. 1 on Geoje Island. When the prisoners of war resisted, the U.S. side surrounded them on three sides and then sprayed them with a so-called "non-toxic irritant." Although the U.S. side is deceiving the world by saying that this "non-toxic irritant" is similar to tear gas, the fact that the U.S. side is furtively unwilling to announce the name and nature of this weapon shows that the U.S. side is continuing to inhumanely use prisoners of war to experiment with new weapons. This is another serious crime by the U.S. side in violating the Geneva Convention.
    In addition, the U.S. side continues to kill prisoners of war who resolutely demand repatriation. On January 15th, in the Sangmudae prisoner of war camp on the Korean mainland, another prisoner of war was beaten to death by so-called "anti-communist prisoners of war" for having "pro-communist suspicions." The U.S. side has always claimed that the prisoner of war camps they set up on the Korean mainland detain so-called "prisoners of war who would rather die than be repatriated," but the fact is that even under the terroristic rule of the U.S. special agents disguised as "anti-communist prisoners of war," the forcibly detained prisoners of war still resolutely demand repatriation even at the cost of their lives. The U.S. side is now clearly stepping up the secret transfer of prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to serve as cannon fodder, and those prisoners of war who resolutely resist are murdered by U.S. special agents. This is the truth of this bloody incident.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th] On January 15th, the U.S. side again beat to death one of our captured personnel in the Sangmudae prisoner of war camp. General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side in the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a serious protest to the U.S. side on January 19th, pointing out that the U.S. side cannot escape full responsibility for the war crimes of slaughtering prisoners of war.

### 美方又将我被俘人员用作新武器实验对象  南日将军抗议美方屠杀战俘的罪行

    美方又将我被俘人员用作新武器实验对象
    南日将军抗议美方屠杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城十九日电】美方竟又公然将我方被俘人员充作新武器的实验对象。据美方宣布，一月十三日，美方在巨济岛第一号战俘营中要将一名战俘捕去加以虐待，遭到战俘们的反对，美方就将他们三面包围，然后向他们喷射一种所谓“无毒刺激品”。虽然美方欺骗世界说，这种“无毒刺激品”和催泪瓦斯相似，但是从美方鬼鬼祟祟地不敢宣布这种武器的名称和性质，就可以看出美方继续在惨无人道地拿战俘来实验新的武器。这是美方破坏日内瓦公约的又一个严重罪行。
    除此之外，美方继续杀害坚决要求遣返的战俘。一月十五日，在朝鲜大陆上的尚武台战俘营中，又有一名战俘因有“亲共嫌疑”而被所谓“反共战俘”打死。美方一向宣称他们设在朝鲜大陆上的战俘营中拘留的是所谓“宁死也不愿遣返”的战俘，但是事实却是：即使在那些“反共战俘”扮成的美方特务的恐怖统治之下，被强迫扣留的战俘们仍然宁死也坚决要求遣返。美方现在显然正在加紧将战俘偷偷移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰，而那些坚决表示抗拒的战俘就遭到了美方特务的杀害。这就是这一血腥事件的真相。
    【新华社开城十九日电】一月十五日美方在尚武台战俘营中又打死我方被俘人员一名。朝鲜停战谈判我方首席代表南日将军在一月十九日向美方提出严重抗议，指出美方决不能逃脱屠杀战俘的战争罪行的完全责任。
