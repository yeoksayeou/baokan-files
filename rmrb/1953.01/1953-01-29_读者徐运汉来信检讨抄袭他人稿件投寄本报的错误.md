    Editor's Note: On November 20th of last year, the "Reader's Letters" page published a letter from Xu Yunhan (pen name Shi Zhongfang), a student at Hunan Provincial Second Normal School, titled "Two Children on a Long-Distance Train." This letter was plagiarized from "Hengyang News." Hunan Provincial Second Normal School has already criticized Xu Yunhan, helping him to recognize his mistake; Xu Yunhan has also made a self-criticism. We believe that Hunan Provincial Second Normal School's approach is correct; Xu Yunhan's self-criticism is also relatively sincere and profound. We now publish the letter from Hunan Provincial Second Normal School and Xu Yunhan's self-criticism below.
    To the Responsible Comrades of the Reader's Letters Group: Our school's student, Xu Yunhan (pen name Shi Zhongfang), plagiarized a manuscript from "Hengyang News" and submitted it to your newspaper for publication, fraudulently obtaining payment. This is a very egregious act. Our ideological education in ordinary times is insufficient, which is one of the reasons why this incident occurred. In the future, in addition to continuing to strengthen ideological education for students, we will also help Xu Yunhan to recognize his mistakes ideologically and make a self-criticism. We are sending his self-criticism along with this letter. Hunan Provincial Second Normal School
    Dear Editors: I should make a profound self-criticism to you: The reader's letter published on the "Reader's Letters" page on November 20th – "Two Children on a Long-Distance Train" – was plagiarized by me from "Hengyang News" in Hengyang City, Hunan. When I received the payment you sent, I felt very ashamed. My classmates and teachers criticized me and helped me recognize my mistake. The main ideological source of my mistake is: I still harbor the corrupt bourgeois ideology of being profit-driven. In order to fraudulently obtain payment, I actually stole the fruits of other people's labor, and at the same time deceived the Party newspaper and the vast number of readers of the Party newspaper, damaging the Party newspaper's prestige among the masses. This behavior is something that a new Chinese person should never have. I have recognized my mistake and guarantee never to commit it again. In the future, I must strengthen my study, transform my ideology, and thoroughly eliminate corrupt bourgeois ideology. The payment is the blood and sweat of the people, and I have absolutely no right to use it. I am returning it now, hoping that you will check and accept it. Xu Yunhan (Shi Zhongfang)

    读者徐运汉来信检讨抄袭他人稿件投寄本报的错误
    编者按：去年十一月二十日“读者来信专页”发表了湖南省立第二师范学校学生徐运汉（笔名石中方）寄来的“两个孩子在长途列车上”一信。这篇来信是从“衡阳新闻”上抄袭来的。湖南省立第二师范学校已对徐运汉提出了批评，帮助他认识自己的错误；徐运汉也已作了检讨。我们认为：湖南省立第二师范学校这种做法是正确的；徐运汉的检讨也是比较诚恳而深刻的。现将湖南省立第二师范的来信和徐运汉的检讨发表于后。
    读者来信组负责同志：我校学生徐运汉（笔名石中方）抄袭“衡阳新闻”稿件，寄给你报发表，骗取稿费。这是很恶劣的行为。我们平时的思想教育不够，是发生这件事的原因之一。今后我们除了对学生继续加强思想教育外，并帮助徐运汉从思想上认识自己的错误，作出检讨。现将他的检讨寄上。  湖南省立第二师范学校
    编辑同志：我应该向你们作深刻检讨：十一月二十日“读者来信专页”所刊的一封读者来信——“两个孩子在长途列车上”，是我从湖南衡阳市的“衡阳新闻”上抄袭来的。当我接到你们寄来的稿费时，惭愧得很。我的同学、老师给我提出了批评，帮我认识了错误。我犯错误的主要思想根源是：我还有着腐朽的资产阶级唯利是图的思想。为了要骗取稿费，我竟盗窃了别人的劳动果实，同时又欺骗了党报和党报的广大读者，损害党报在群众中的威信。这种行为是一个新中国人民决不应该有的。我认识了自己的错误，并保证决不再犯。今后，我一定要加强学习，改造自己的思想，把腐朽的资产阶级思想肃清。稿费是人民的血汗，我根本没有权利使用它，今退回，望你们查收。徐运汉（石中方）
