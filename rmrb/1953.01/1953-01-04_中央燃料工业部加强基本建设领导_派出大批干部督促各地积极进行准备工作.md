The Central Fuel Industry Ministry Strengthens Leadership in Capital Construction
Sends Large Number of Cadres to Supervise and Urge Active Preparations in Various Regions

    In order to strengthen leadership in capital construction, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has successively convened the National Electricity Industry Capital Construction Conference, the Coal Mine Planning and Capital Construction Conference, and the Coal, Electricity, and Other Design Conferences in the past three months. Through these conferences, the thinking of cadres, especially leading cadres, has further recognized the necessity of placing capital construction in a primary position, resolving to transfer personnel from production departments to strengthen the capital construction force, and concentrating the use of funds and carrying out focused construction. For example, it was decided that the focus of coal mine capital construction should be placed in the regions with the most developed heavy industry. In addition to considering the need to renovate some old mines to expand production to meet the demand for coal before 1957, the focus is on the construction of new mines and open-pit coal mines, and other projects that can be postponed will be suspended. One-quarter of the 1953 coal mine capital construction investment will be used for drilling engineering and cadre training, with an emphasis on areas within the customs for these two investments.
    In order to better implement the leadership's intentions, after the meetings, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government also sent a large number of cadres with a focus to coal mines such as Fuxin, Huainan, and Fengfeng, and electricity bureaus and factories such as Shenyang, Changchun, Fushun, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an to check the completion of the 1952 capital construction projects, summarize the gains and reasons for non-completion of the projects, and convey the spirit of the capital construction conference, urging the establishment and strengthening of capital construction organizations to prepare for the 1953 capital construction. In addition, a group of cadres (including bureau-level cadres) were sent to East China, North China, Central South, and other regions, focusing on checking the reactions and thoughts of various factories and mines regarding the transfer of cadres. This inspection found that some factories and mines have made certain achievements due to the importance attached by the leadership. For example, the Xi'an Power Plant, although the conditions in all aspects are poor, the leadership of the plant, with the help of Soviet experts, can actively and proactively create conditions and overcome difficulties, thus completing the tasks given by the state. Another example is the Fuxin Mining Bureau, which has overfulfilled the total amount of capital construction work in 1952 by 1.1 percent. This is because the bureau started to prepare the plan and design work as early as August 1951, seized the preparation of materials at the beginning of last year, implemented the instruction to strengthen capital construction in April last year, adjusted the organization, and transferred more than 2,200 people to strengthen the capital construction force. In addition, the bureau also established a set of special responsibility systems and promptly checked and solved problems, ensuring the quality of work. However, many factories and mines still do not have a sufficient understanding of the complexity and arduousness of capital construction work, and some factories and mines even casually pile up very important materials in open spaces without anyone responsible for management, and the strengthening of capital construction only remains on the plan. For example, the Zhengzhou Power Plant, although the conditions are better than the Xi'an Power Plant, the water pump for the construction site's water source has not yet been installed, the highway has not yet started construction, and the power line project has only just begun; the Huainan Mining Bureau has also delayed in conveying the spirit of the capital construction conference and has not carried out preparations. For these serious situations, the负责人 of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has given severe criticism, pointing out that if they are not quickly corrected, it will cause political mistakes.
    Regarding the transfer of cadres, the coal mine sector has transferred 64 percent of the planned transfer, and the electricity sector has transferred 71 percent. In the transfer work, many factories and mines still have the idea of not wanting to transfer the best engineering and technical personnel to the capital construction department, and individual factories and mines even have the phenomenon of casually sending some people to make up the numbers. These biases must be resolutely corrected.
    Recently, at an important meeting, Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, pointed out that the leadership work of fuel industry capital construction still has many weaknesses, specifically manifested in the poor preparation work and insufficient attention. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels of the fuel industry system must pay special attention to capital construction, conduct a good inspection, and do a good job in preparing for 1953.

### 中央燃料工业部加强基本建设领导  派出大批干部督促各地积极进行准备工作

    中央燃料工业部加强基本建设领导
    派出大批干部督促各地积极进行准备工作
    中央人民政府燃料工业部为加强基本建设领导，最近三个月来曾连续召开了全国电业基本建设会议、煤矿计划及基本建设会议和煤、电等设计会议。通过这几次会议，干部特别是主要领导干部的思想进一步认识了必需把基本建设放在首要地位，下决心从生产部门抽调人员来充实基本建设力量，并集中使用资金和进行有重点的建设。例如决定煤矿基本建设的重点放在重工业最发达的地区；除考虑为了一九五七年以前的需煤情况，必须改建一部分旧井扩大生产外，重点放在新井和露天煤矿的建设上，其余可以暂缓的工程都停止进行；一九五三年煤矿基本建设投资的四分之一用在钻探工程和培养干部方面，这两项投资又以关内为重点。
    为了更好地贯彻领导意图，会议以后，中央人民政府燃料工业部又派出大批干部有重点地到阜新、淮南、峰峰等煤矿和沈阳、长春、抚顺、郑州、西安等电业局、厂，检查一九五二年基本建设工程的完成情况，总结工程中的收获和未完成的原因，并传达基本建设会议精神，督促建立和加强基本建设机构，以做好一九五三年基本建设的准备工作。另外又派出一批干部（包括局长级干部在内）分赴华东、华北、中南等区，着重检查各地厂矿对于抽调干部的反应和思想情况。这次检查发现：某些厂、矿由于领导重视，已作出一定成绩。例如西安发电厂，各方面条件虽然较差，但该厂领导方面在苏联专家帮助下能积极主动地创造条件，克服困难，因此完成国家给予的任务。又如阜新矿务局已超额百分之一点一完成一九五二年基本建设工作总量，这是因为该局早在一九五一年八月就着手进行编制计划和设计工作，去年年初抓紧了器材准备工作，去年四月贯彻执行加强基本建设的指示，调整了机构，调配了二千二百多人充实基本建设力量。此外，该局还建立一套专责制度，并及时检查解决问题，使工作质量得到保证。可是，还有不少厂、矿对基本建设工作的复杂性、艰巨性认识不足，甚至有的厂、矿把很重要的器材随便堆在空场上，没有专人负责管理，对于加强基本建设只停留在计划上。例如郑州电厂，虽然条件比西安发电厂好，但至今工地水源水泵尚未安装，公路尚未动工，电源线路工程也才开始；淮南矿务局也迟迟未把基本建设会议精神传达下去，更未进行准备工作。对于这些严重情况，中央人民政府燃料工业部负责人已给予严厉批评，指出如不很快纠正，将造成政治上的错误。
    关于抽调干部工作，煤矿部分已抽调计划抽调的百分之六十四，电业部分已抽调百分之七十一。在抽调工作中，不少厂矿也还存在着不愿把最好的工程技术人员输送到基本建设部门的思想，个别厂矿甚至有随便送些人来充数的现象。这些偏向必须坚决纠正。
    最近在一次重要会议上，中央人民政府燃料工业部陈郁部长指出目前燃料工业基本建设的领导工作还有不少弱点，具体表现是准备工作做得差，抓得还不够紧。因此，燃料工业系统各级领导干部必须特别重视基本建设，很好地进行检查，并做好一九五三年的准备工作。
