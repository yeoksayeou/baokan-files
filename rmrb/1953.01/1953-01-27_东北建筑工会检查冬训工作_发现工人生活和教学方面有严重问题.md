The Northeast Construction Workers Union organized seven working groups in mid-January to inspect the winter training work of construction workers in Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Harbin, Qiqihar, Jilin, Changchun, Dalian, and other places. They discovered many urgent problems that need to be solved.

The winter training work in the above-mentioned areas began in early December last year. After political studies such as contrasting the old and new societies, the consciousness of the workers has been initially raised. Many units have paid attention to organizing cultural and recreational activities for workers, appropriately solving some of the workers' living problems, and some units have also launched a mass movement of "signing covenants and making guarantees." The workers' enthusiasm for learning has gradually stabilized and is beginning to turn to a climax. However, there are still many serious problems that need to be solved urgently. These problems are mainly:

I. Many units lack experience in such large-scale centralized training work. At the same time, they did not fully recognize the importance of this work at the beginning, and the preparation work was not sufficient, especially the solutions to workers' lives and welfare problems were very unsatisfactory. The more common phenomena are that workers are not eating well, dormitories are too cold, and sanitary conditions are poor. For example, the dormitory of the Harbin Trade Department Construction Site can only accommodate 200 people, but it houses more than 500 people, and the sanitary conditions are bad. In the dormitory of the third construction site of the fifth engineering office of the First Engineering Company, the northwest wind blows directly in, and many workers are unwilling to live there. They said, "As long as you sleep here for one night, you won't be able to get out of bed tomorrow morning." The canteen is so cold that the chopsticks freeze into ice sticks; there are only two windows for selling food, and it takes half an hour to wait, so the workers are unwilling to go to the canteen to eat. Some winter training classes in Changchun do not have classrooms, so they have to pull the loudspeakers to the narrow dormitories and let the workers listen to the lectures in the dormitories. Sometimes the loudspeakers are broken, and the workers can't hear anything. These serious situations have not been improved in time. Workers at the construction site of the Heilongjiang Provincial Trade Company reported that the stoves in the dormitories were difficult to burn and there were too few odd-job workers (only one worker for more than 300 people in the dormitory), but the director of the construction site said, "What if the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is so difficult?" The above situation has affected the workers' learning mood, and some do not want to study and want to go home.

II. Some units believe that they have solved the problems of teachers, classrooms, dormitories, and canteens, and it is "all is well," so they have relaxed their leadership over winter training. Therefore, there are also many problems in teaching. Many units have low-quality teachers and do not prepare their lessons carefully. Some teachers make mistakes in their lectures, and some teachers only read from books. Therefore, many workers are unwilling to listen to the lectures, some sleep in the classroom, some play poker, and some simply slip away. Some units have not yet established a counselor system, and some have counselors, but the quality is too poor. For example, when workers in the training class of the Fushun City Real Estate Office asked the counselor what "three evils" and "five poisons" were, he said nonsense that land reform was one of the three evils. Some units have issued discussion topics that workers cannot discuss, such as "What stages should the new democratic revolution go through, and how is it different from the Soviet Union?" "What is the basic experience of the Chinese revolution?" and so on. Many leading cadres of winter training classes have a very poor understanding of the specific situation below. For example, Su Changyou's group in Harbin did not study very well, and some workers played poker during discussions; the average score of the group in the December exam was less than 20 points, and four or five people got zero points, but the trade union leaders of the office still thought that Su Changyou's group was one of the best groups in learning.

III. Some municipal trade unions and grassroots trade unions mistakenly believe that the Party committee is mainly responsible for winter training, and the trade union is only cooperating, and do not regard winter training as the focus of the current trade union work, but adopt a laissez-faire attitude. For example, the Fushun and Dalian Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, although some people participated in the leadership of winter training, no one did specific work. The Shenyang, Jilin, and other municipal federations of trade unions did not even have anyone participating in the leadership of winter training. Some grassroots trade unions did not actively participate in winter training work, so they could not grasp the ideological situation of the masses well, reflect the opinions of the masses in time, and urge the administration to actively solve the above-mentioned problems.

In addition, the cultural and recreational activities of many units cannot meet the needs of the workers.

At present, the Northeast Construction Workers Union is assisting the Party committees in various places to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings and overcome the bureaucratic leadership style in the winter training work in various places.

### 东北建筑工会检查冬训工作  发现工人生活和教学方面有严重问题

    东北建筑工会检查冬训工作
    发现工人生活和教学方面有严重问题
    东北建筑工会一月中旬组织了七个工作组，分赴沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、吉林、长春、旅大等地检查建筑工人冬训工作，发现了很多亟需解决的问题。
    上述各地的冬训工作，从去年十二月上旬开始。经过新旧社会对比等政治学习，职工觉悟已有初步提高。不少单位都注意组织了职工的文化娱乐活动，适当解决了一些职工的生活问题，有的单位还开展了群众性的“订公约、提保证”运动，职工的学习情绪已逐渐稳定，并开始转向高潮。但是也还存在着很多严重问题亟待解决。这些问题主要是：
    一、不少单位因为对这样庞大的集中训练工作缺乏经验，同时开始时对这一工作的重要性认识不足，准备工作做得不够充分，特别是对工人生活、福利问题解决得很不能令人满意。比较普遍的现象，是工人吃得不好，宿舍太冷，卫生条件恶劣。如哈尔滨贸易部工地只能住下二百人的宿舍，却住了五百多人，卫生条件又坏。第一工程公司第五工程处第三工地宿舍，西北风直往里吹，许多工人都不愿住在里面。他们说：“只要在这里睡一宿，明天早晨都起不来床。”食堂里冷得筷子都冻成了冰棍；卖饭的地方只有两个窗口，一等就是半个钟头，工人都不愿到食堂去吃饭。长春有的冬训班没有教室，只好把扩音器拉到狭小的宿舍去，让工人在宿舍里听课。有时扩音器坏了，工人什么也听不到。这些严重情况，都没有及时改进。黑龙江省贸易公司工地工人反映，宿舍里炉子不好烧，勤杂人员太少（三百多人的宿舍只有一名工友），工地主任却说：“抗美援朝那样艰苦怎么办？”以上情况影响了工人的学习情绪，有的已不愿学习想回家去。
    二、有些单位认为有了教员，初步解决了教室、宿舍、食堂等问题，已是“万事大吉”，便放松了对冬训的领导，因此教学方面也存在着很多问题。不少单位教员质量低，又不认真准备功课。有的教员讲课时错误百出，有的教员只照书本宣读。因此许多工人不愿听课，有的在课堂上睡觉，有的打扑克牌，有的干脆溜走了。有些单位还没有建立辅导员制度，有的虽配备了辅导员，但质量太差。如抚顺市房产处训练班工人问辅导员什么叫“三害”、“五毒”时，他竟信口开河地说土地改革是三害之一。有些单位出的讨论题目使工人无法讨论，如“新民主主义革命要经过什么阶段，和苏联有什么不同？”“中国革命的基本经验是什么？”等等。不少冬训班的领导干部对下边的具体情况了解得很差。如哈尔滨苏长有小组学习不很好，有的工人在讨论时打扑克；十二月份考试时小组平均分数不到二十分，有四、五个人得零分，而该处工会领导干部还认为苏长有小组是学习最好的一个小组。
    三、有些市工会和基层工会错误地认为冬训工作主要是党委负责，工会只是配合，不把冬训工作当作当前工会工作的重点，而采取了似管不管的态度。如抚顺、旅大市总工会，虽有人参加冬训领导工作，但无人作具体工作。沈阳、吉林等市总工会连参加冬训领导工作的人也没有。有的基层工会没有主动地参加冬训工作，因此就不能很好掌握群众思想情况，及时反映群众意见，督促行政积极解决上述存在的问题。
    此外，不少单位的文化娱乐活动，也还不能适应职工的需要。
    目前，东北建筑工会正协助各地党委改正上述缺点，克服各地冬训工作中的官僚主义领导作风。
