    A Record of the Yellow River Source Exploration
    Xiang Lizhi, Dong Zaihua
    In order to completely eradicate the Yellow River's flood disasters and develop the resources of the Yellow River basin, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, in conjunction with the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, organized the Yellow River Source Exploration Team in August 1952. The team delved deep into the grassland areas of Qinghai Province, explored the source of the Yellow River along the Yellow River valley, surveyed the hydrological conditions of a section of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Tongtian River, between the Se Wu Qu (River) and the Qumalai (River), and discovered several misunderstandings in the past regarding the geographical situation of this area.
    I. Under What Circumstances Did We Conduct
        the Source Exploration Work?
    We departed from Kaifeng on August 2, 1952, and returned to Kaifeng on December 23 of the same year, lasting four months and twenty-two days. We carried out our work under very difficult conditions. The areas we surveyed were all within Qinghai Province, mostly uninhabited or sparsely populated areas. The terrain here is very high, starting from the Yellow River bank, all above 4,000 meters above sea level, and the highest reaching 4,900 meters. Due to the high terrain, low air pressure, and thin air, we sometimes felt difficulty breathing. The climate here is very cold, often below -20 or -30 degrees Celsius at night, and the coldest reached -36 degrees Celsius. The wind would pick up after 12 noon every day, comrades looking in the mirror often had tears in their eyes, and everyone's hands were often chapped.
    The differences in ethnic languages also caused some difficulties. Qinghai Province has a total of six ethnic groups. The areas we surveyed were mostly inhabited by Tibetans, who still lead a nomadic life. Transportation was also difficult, with grain, horse feed, and equipment all carried by yaks.
    We were not intimidated by these difficulties. We had all undergone "Three-Anti" studies, and whenever we faced difficulties, we immediately felt endless strength when we thought of the Red Army's Long March and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea against America.
    An important reason why we were able to successfully complete our mission was the strong support and guidance from the Party, the People's Government, and the Military Region of Qinghai Province. Therefore, we did not feel any major difficulties in our work and material life. This is something we are grateful for.
    II. The Route of the Exploration and the Discoveries
    We started from the Yellow River bank in Qinghai Province, passed through Zhaling Lake, Eling Lake, Starry Sea, followed the Yellow River to Zuomo Yalang (tributary on the right bank of the Yellow River), then crossed the Bayan Har Mountains (Zuomo Mountains) along Zuomo Yalang to the Kara Qu source. Then we crossed the Gaqu Helang Gola Pass at 4,670 meters, went up to Se Wu Qu (tributary of Tongtian River), descended along Se Wu Qu to the Tongtian River, and then along the left bank of the Tongtian River to the Qiang Seng Duo Lai Bu Yong (place name) Qumalai (River) to the entrance of the Tongtian River. From there, we returned via a section of the Qumalai River called "Maizhu Jiayi" (place name), the north and south of Labuze, Yuegu Zonglie Qu, the Zuomo Yalang River, the Zuomo Mountains, "Kara Qu", Eling Lake, Duo Qu, Zhaling Lake, to the Yellow River bank. The total journey was about 10,000 li (approximately 5,000 kilometers).
    Our first discovery was the correct location of Zhaling Lake and Eling Lake. On most maps, Zhaling Lake is upstream and Eling Lake is downstream. This time, we traveled upstream from the Yellow River bank, roughly in a northwest to west direction, for about 60 kilometers, then turned south, and reached the lower entrance of a large lake. The Tibetans call this lake "Cuo Jialang" (Tibetan, transliteration). In Tibetan, "Cuo" means "lake", and "Jialang" is the name of the lake, which is similar to the sound of "Zhaling Lake". It is said that it takes three "horse stations" (one horse station is 40 to 50 kilometers) to go around the lake. The upper entrance of the lake is on the south side of the lake. The Yellow River turns west to north along the Bayan Langma Mountains for 28 kilometers, and reaches the lower entrance of another lake, which the Tibetans call "Cuo Elang", which is similar to the sound of "Eling Lake". It takes two and a half "horse stations" to go around the lake. Thus, the Zhaling Lake and Eling Lake marked on general maps may be reversed. We conducted multiple investigations to clarify the locations and names of these two lakes, and the results were as described above.
    Our second discovery was finding the source of the Yellow River. In the past, Chinese geography books said that the Yellow River originated from the Starry Sea under the Gedasu Qi Lao Mountains in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai; maps also showed the source of the Yellow River as a small sea, labeled as the Starry Sea. After this exploration, we first found that the location of the Starry Sea was problematic. The Starry Sea is directly connected to the upper entrance of Eling Lake and is a series of pools of different sizes located on a wide grassland of five or six kilometers. The larger ones are several hundred square meters; the smaller ones are only one or two square meters. The Tibetans call this area "Cuo Gashi Ze", which means Starry Sea. Above the Starry Sea is a large grassland, about 20 kilometers wide, which the Tibetans call "Ma Yong" ("Yong" means "beach", "Ma" means "Yellow", the Tibetans call the Yellow River "Ma Qu"). The Yellow River flows through here in a meandering way. Above "Ma Yong" is Yuegu Zonglie Qu (transliteration). Further west is the watershed. About 30 kilometers west of the watershed is a large mountain named "Yahe Ladada Heze", about 5,440 meters high (measured by barometer), with a magnificent shape that stands out above the mountains. This mountain is the central hub of the Qinghai water system. The water flowing northwest from this mountain enters the Qaidam Basin, the water flowing south enters the Tongtian River in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the water flowing east enters the Yellow River. The Tibetans have two very common folk songs: "Ma Sai Ba, Yada Yuegu Sai; Yue Sai Ba, Yara Dada Heze" (transliteration), meaning that the source of the Yellow River comes from "Yuegu Zonglie". The source of "Yuegu Zonglie" is in "Yahe Ladada Heze". Thus, the Yellow River does not originate from the Starry Sea under the Gedasu Qi Lao Mountains, but from "Yuegu Zonglie" east of "Yahe Ladada Heze". "Yuegu Zonglie" is a large basin at the very source of the Yellow River, with a total area of about 200 square kilometers, and there are also many small lakes of varying sizes inside.
    As for the Gedasu Qi Lao Mountains here, we never found them. After we passed Eling Lake, we began to pay attention to this famous mountain. All the way from the Tongtian River around the source of the Yellow River - Yuegu Zonglie, passing through "Zuomo Yalang", "Zuomo Malang", "Kara Qu", "Ruima Qu", "Duo Qu" (Qu, Tibetan, means river or water), and the mountains on both sides of the southern tributaries of the Yellow River, there was no mountain called "Gedasu Qi Lao Mountain". South of the Starry Sea is a Zuomo Mountain, with one peak in the middle, surrounded by mountains, with a magnificent shape. The mountain top is covered with snow all year round. According to the location on the map, it seems to be "Gedasu Qi Lao Mountain", but the Tibetans call it "Kara Oga Zuoma", which means "White-faced Goddess" mountain. According to the Tibetans: This used to be the place where the Mongolian people grazed. They migrated away several years ago. The Tibetans do not know the mountain name "Gedasu Qi Lao Mountain".
    III. The Life of the Tibetan People
    The Tibetan people were helpful to our work. After we departed from the Yellow River bank, we only met two people passing by in twenty-two days. They answered all our questions and were of great help. When we arrived at the Se Wu Qu, a tributary of the Tongtian River, we found most of the Tibetan tents. The Qumalai Administrative Bureau's tents were on the south bank of the Se Wu Qu, which is the autonomous government of the Tibetan area. We paid a cordial visit to the Administrative Bureau and were very excited to see the five-star national flag flying on the Administrative Bureau's tent. In the center of the tent hung a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, with portraits of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Premier Zhou on both sides, as well as handwritten inscriptions from Chairman Mao and the Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government to the ethnic minorities. When we visited, Chairman Mi (Tibetan) of the Administrative Bureau and other staff (mostly Tibetans) talked with smiling faces about the Central People's Government's concern for the ethnic minorities. They were always responsive to our requests for assistance, such as asking for guides, buying sheep, and buying butter. They also gave us two sheep and a lot of butter and milk as a gesture of appreciation. When we gave them portraits of Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically hugged and kissed the portraits. Although they all spoke Tibetan, they could understand the three Chinese characters "Mao Zhuxi" (Chairman Mao). Whenever they heard us mention Chairman Mao, they invariably raised their thumbs to express their infinite respect. They also asked us to report to Chairman Mao about their happy life after liberation and asked the government to eliminate the remaining bandits. Due to the Tibetan people's meticulous hospitality, we felt great warmth in the desolate grassland.
    Secretary Hu Shanba (transliteration) of the Qumalai Administrative Bureau also told us about their living conditions. He said: "The warlord Ma Bufang completely ruled our ethnic minorities by means of massacre and persecution, making us live like cattle and horses. Our main product here is wool, but at that time, we had to travel hundreds of miles to carry a load of wool (about 120-130 jin carried by a yak), and we could only sell it for two hard coins. Sometimes, Ma Bufang would steal it." He then raised his thumb and said: "Now we are very different from the past. The People's Government takes care of the lives of the people of ethnic minorities, and has established a trading company here, bringing us daily necessities from remote cities. The price of wool has increased, and now each jin of wool can be sold for more than 7,000 yuan."
    The Tibetans in the Yellow River source area and the Tongtian River area all believe in Lamaism, worship the Panchen Lama, and have temples. The temples here do not have courtyards or tents, but are piles of stone slabs engraved with scriptures on the open ground of the hillside. There are four such temples on the right bank of the Se Wu River, presided over by a Living Buddha. Some Tibetans enshrine the spiritual seat of the Panchen Lama in their tents. Many lamas wear the image of the Panchen on their chests.
    The lives of the Tibetans in the Tongtian River basin are completely adapted to the special environment of the grassland plateau. Every household has a yak hair tent, which is moved according to the different seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The tent has a door in the front and a skylight at the top, and is supported by ropes all around. White cloth or flags are hung on the top of the tent. A stove is set up in the tent, with men on the left and women on the right, each with their own seat. There are no beds, tables, or chairs. The ground is covered with felt blankets, sheepskins, and other items. They worship gods and Living Buddhas in the right corner, and guests stay in the left corner. Tibetans do not use quilts when sleeping, but lie on the blanket with their clothes on, while the young and strong sleep outside the tent. Generally, every Tibetan has a sheepskin coat, and the edges of the coat are lined with wide borders of black, purple, or red cloth or silk. Tibetans with better living conditions have cloth shirts and felt hats, leather boots, or felt boots.
    Tibetan women like to decorate themselves. They have dozens of small braids on their heads, with the ends of the braids connected to form a braid net, with tassels hanging behind, sometimes decorated with silver bowls, gemstones, or silver coins.
    Both men and women often expose their right arm, with the empty sleeve hanging down. This is for the convenience of labor.
    The diet of the Tibetans here mainly consists of beef, mutton, milk, and butter. Fried noodles and rice are relatively noble foods.
    Women take the lead in the labor of the Tibetans. The main tasks in the home, such as cooking, picking up cow dung, milking, herding cattle and sheep, and making butter, are all done by women. Men mainly hunt, sew clothes, go out to do business, and sometimes also take on the task of herding cattle and sheep. In the past, robberies often occurred between tribes, but now they have been greatly reduced. (Attached pictures)

    黄河河源勘查记
    项立志  董在华
    黄河水利委员会为了彻底根绝黄河水患，开发黄河流域资源，特会同中央燃料工业部在一九五二年八月组织了黄河河源查勘队，深入青海省草原地带，沿黄河河谷，查勘了黄河河源的情况，并且查勘了长江上源通天河的色吾渠（河）和曲麻莱（河）之间的一段河势的水文情况，还发现了过去人们对这一带地理形势上的若干误会。
    一、我们是在什么情况下进行
        河源勘查工作的
    一九五二年八月二日，我们由开封出发，同年十二月二十三日返回开封，前后历时四个月零二十二天。我们是在十分困难的条件下进行工作的。我们所查勘的地区全部在青海省境内，大部是无人区和少人区。这里的地势很高，从黄河沿岸算起，都在拔海四千公尺以上，最高的到四千九百公尺。由于地形高、气压低、空气稀薄，有时竟感到呼吸困难。这里的气候很冷，夜晚经常在零下二、三十度，最冷时到过零下三十六度。每天十二时以后就要起风，看镜子的同志眼睛经常流着泪，大家的手经常裂着口子。
    由于民族言语不同，也造成了若干困难。青海省共有六种民族，我们查勘的地区，绝大部分住的是藏民，他们都还过着游牧生活。交通运输也很困难，粮食、马料和用具都是用毛牛驮着。
    我们没有被这些困难所吓倒。我们都经过“三反”学习，我们在困难时，一想到过去红军的长征和志愿军在朝鲜抗美援朝的情况，立刻涌来无限的力量。
    我们能顺利完成任务的一个重要原因，是青海省的党、人民政府和军区对我们的大力帮助和指导，因此，我们在工作上和物质生活上，都未感受到大的困难。这是我们值得感谢的。
    二、勘查经过的路线和发现
    我们由青海省的黄河沿出发，经过扎陵湖、鄂陵湖、星宿海，沿黄河至左谟雅朗（黄河右岸支流），再沿左谟雅朗越巴颜喀喇（左谟山）至喀喇渠源。再越四千六百七十公尺的尕曲合朗各拉山口，上至色吾渠（通天河支流），沿色吾渠下至通天河边，再沿通天河左翼的加强僧多来不涌（地名）曲麻莱
    （河）进入通天河的入口处。由此返回，经曲麻莱河的一段“麦诸甲夷”（地名）、拉不泽南北、约古宗列渠、左谟雅朗河、左谟山、“喀喇渠”、鄂陵湖、多渠、扎陵湖，至黄河沿。行程共约一万华里。
    我们第一个发现是扎陵湖和鄂陵湖的正确位置。在一般的地图上，都是扎陵湖在上游，鄂陵湖在下游。我们这次从黄河沿逆流向上走，大致成西北转西的方向，约有六十余公里，再向南一转，就到了一个大湖的下口。藏民把这个湖叫“错加朗”
    （藏语，音译）。藏语“错”是“湖”的意思，
    “加朗”是湖名，正和“扎陵湖”的音差不多。据说绕该湖一周须三“马站”（一马站四至五十公里）。湖上口在湖的南面。黄河沿着巴颜朗马山向西转北二十八公里，就到了另一个湖的下口，藏民把这个湖叫做“错鄂朗”，正和“鄂陵湖”的音差不多。绕湖一周须两个半“马站”。这样，一般地图上所印注的扎陵湖和鄂陵湖可能是颠倒了。我们为了弄清这两个湖的位置及名称，曾进行了多次考查，结果还是如前面所说。
    我们第二个发现是找到了黄河的水源。以前我国地理书都说黄河发源于青海巴颜喀喇山葛达素齐老山下的星宿海；地图上也是把黄河源头上画成一个小海子的形状，注名星宿海。我们经过这次查勘，首先发现星宿海的位置有问题。星宿海紧接于鄂陵湖的上口，是位于一个宽广五、六公里的草滩上的大小不同的水池。大的有几百平方公尺；小的只有
    一、二平方公尺，藏民把这片地方叫作“错尕世泽”，就是星宿海的意思。星宿海的上面是一片大草滩，宽约二十余公里，藏民叫它作“马涌”（“涌”是“滩”的意思，“马”是“黄”的意思，藏民把黄河叫“马渠”）。黄河从这里弯曲通过。在“马涌”以上，是约古宗列渠（译音）。再西是分水岭。在分水岭以西约三十公里，有一座大山名“雅合拉达合泽”，高约五千四百四十公尺（气压计引测），形状雄伟，突出群山之上，此山为青海省水系的中枢。从这个山向西北流的水入柴达木盆地，向南流的水入长江上游的通天河，向东流的水入了黄河。藏民有两句很普通的民谣：“马塞巴，雅达约古塞；约塞巴，雅拉达合泽”（译音），意思是黄河的来源出自“约古宗列”。“约古宗列”的来源是在“雅合拉达合泽”。这样说来，黄河不是发源于葛达素齐老山下的星宿海，而是发源于“雅合拉达合泽”以东的“约古宗列”了。“约古宗列”是黄河顶源的一个大盆地，总面积约有二百平方公里，里边也有很多大小不一的小湖。
    至于这里的葛达素齐老山，我们始终没有找到。我们过了鄂陵湖就开始注意这座名山。一直从通天河绕黄河源头——约古宗列，经过了“左谟雅朗”、“左谟马朗”、“喀喇渠”、“瑞马渠”、“多渠”
    （渠，藏音，是河或水的意思）、黄河南岸各支流两岸的山，并没有一个山叫“葛达素齐老山”。在星宿海以南有一座左谟山，中有一峰，被群山环绕，形势雄壮。山顶常年积雪。按地图上的位置，好像是
    “葛达素齐老山”，可是藏民叫它“喀喇哦尕左马”，意思是“白脸女神”山。据藏民说：从前这里都是蒙古民族游牧的地方。他们在若干年前就迁移走了。藏民都不知道“葛达素齐老山”这个山名。
    三、藏族人民的生活
    藏族人民对我们的工作是有帮助的。我们从黄河沿出发，走了二十二天，仅遇到两个过路的人，他们对我们是有问即答，帮助很大。到了通天河支流色吾渠上，才发现多数的藏民帐篷。曲麻莱设治局的帐篷就在色吾渠的南岸，这是藏区的自治政府。我们到设治局作了一次亲切的访问，看到五星国旗飘扬在设治局的帐篷上，感到非常兴奋。帐篷内正中悬着伟大领袖毛主席像，朱总司令和周总理的像挂在两旁，还有毛主席和中央人民政府各副主席对少数民族的亲笔赠言。当我们访问时，设治局米主席（藏民）和其他工作人员（多是藏民），都是满脸笑容地谈着中央人民政府对少数民族的关怀。我们请求他们协助的事情，如请向导、买羊、买酥油等等，他们都是有求必应。他们还慰劳我们两只羊和许多酥油、牛奶。当我们把毛主席的像送给他们时，他们都热情地抱着像接吻，他们虽然都说藏语，但是能听懂汉语“毛主席”三个字音。他们每听到我们说到毛主席，总是无例外的伸出大指来表示无限的崇敬。他们并要我们向毛主席反映他们解放后的美满生活，要求政府给他们消灭残留的土匪。由于藏族人民对我们无微不至的热情招待，使我们在荒寂的草原上感到极大的温暖。
    曲麻莱设治局的胡山吧（译音）秘书，还把他们的生活情形告诉我们。他说：“马匪步芳对我们少数民族完全是用残杀迫害的办法统治着，使我们过着牛马一般的生活。我们这里主要的出产是羊毛，
    可是那时我们跑几百里，驮一驮羊毛（一个毛牛约驮一百二三十斤），只能卖两块硬币。有时还要被马匪步芳抢走。”他接着又举起大拇指来说：“现在我们已和过去大不相同了，人民政府照顾少数民族人民的生活，在我们这里设立了贸易公司，由遥远的城市给我们运来了生活必需品。羊毛的价格提高了，现在每斤羊毛能卖七千多元。”
    黄河河源及通天河一带的藏民都信奉喇嘛教，崇拜班禅活佛并设有寺宇。这里的寺宇没有院房，也没有帐篷，是在山坡空地上用刻着经文的石片堆成的垛。这种寺宇在色吾河右岸有四处，由一位活佛主持。有的藏民在帐篷内供奉着班禅活佛的神位。许多喇嘛在胸前都佩带着班禅的龛像。
    通天河流域的藏民生活，是完全适应草地高原的特殊环境的。每家都有一顶牛毛帐篷，随着春夏秋冬不同季节来转动。帐棚前敞一门，上开天窗，四外用棒绳支系。帐棚上边挂着白布或旗。帐棚中设炉灶，男左女右，分别两席，没有床铺桌椅，地上铺毛毡毯、羊皮等物。他们供神及活佛均在右角，有客宿在左角。藏人睡觉不用被褥，合衣躺在毛毯上，壮年的人则睡在帐棚外。一般藏民每人都有老羊皮衣一件，衣上喜用黑色、紫色或红色布或绸子镶成宽边。生活比较好的藏民有布制衬衣和毡帽、皮靴或毡靴。
    藏民妇女喜装饰，头上有扎成的小辫数十根，辫稍相连成辫网，背后垂绦，有时上缀银碗、宝石或银币等。
    无论男女常把右臂露在外边，空袖偏垂着。这是为的便于劳动。
    这里的藏民以牛羊肉、牛奶、酥油等为主食。炒面和大米，是比较高贵的食品。
    藏民的劳动，妇女占先。家中主要的工作如：做饭、拾牛粪、挤奶子、放牛羊、做酥油都是妇女。男人主要是打猎、缝衣服、出外经商，有时也担任放牛放羊的任务。过去部落与部落之间经常发生互相抢夺事件，现在已大大减少了。（附图片）
