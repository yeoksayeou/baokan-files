	On the Problem of Anglo-American Competition in India
	Soviet Union  Viktorov

	The increasing intensification of Anglo-American contradictions is a characteristic of modern capitalism.

	As early as 1928, Stalin pointed out that "the contradiction between American capitalism and British capitalism has become the fundamental contradiction among all contradictions within the capitalist camp." In 1930, at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, Stalin re-emphasized the significance of Anglo-American contradictions when discussing the characteristics of the sharpening of the inherent contradictions of world capitalism due to the global economic crisis. He pointed out that among the contradictions between the most important imperialist countries, the Anglo-American contradiction was the main one. "The main struggle, whether in terms of commodity exports or capital exports, is between Britain and the United States. This is not difficult to understand by looking at any economic newspaper or document on commodity and capital exports. The main areas of their struggle are South America, China, and the colonies and protectorates of the old imperialist countries."

	After World War II, as a result of the war, six European countries and three Asian countries, including China, broke away from the capitalist system, and thus, the competition between Anglo-American imperialism became more acute. The contradictions between American imperialism and British imperialism took on a more brutal nature because this struggle occurred within a shrinking and disintegrating capitalist system. The policies of aggression and war launched jointly by the American and British ruling groups not only did not weaken but strengthened the contradictions between them, causing conflicts of their imperialist interests.

	In the struggle between these two imperialist rivals, Asian countries, especially India, occupy a most important position. This struggle has been going on for decades, and has unfolded with particular intensity in the post-war period. In discussing the post-war period, it should be noted that the most important factor determining the overall situation in Asian countries is the powerful upsurge of the national liberation movement, which is destroying the cornerstones of imperialism in colonies and dependent countries.

	It goes without saying that whether it is the policy of American imperialism or that of British imperialism, both aim to suppress the national liberation movement and enslave the peoples of Asia. This commonality of purpose of the imperialists absolutely does not eliminate the contradictions between them. It is precisely because of the development of these contradictions, the development of the struggle between imperialist powers, that the roles played by the imperialist countries in implementing their policies of suppressing national liberation movements are exposed.

	What is the situation in India? There is no doubt that both British imperialism and American imperialism are attempting to enslave this country. British capitalists, pursuing their imperialist aims, are trying to maintain and consolidate their position in India. American capitalists and American diplomacy have also launched frantic activities in order to further penetrate the Indian market and seize economic and political positions in India. However, it absolutely cannot be said that British and American imperialists occupy equal positions in India.

	Gyan Chand, who served as India's Commissioner to the International Monetary Fund, said this in a speech to students at Patna City College last December about the situation in India. He said that Britain "continues to occupy a leading position in the most important sectors of the Indian national economy. Britain controls the Indian jute, petroleum, coal, matches, mica, manganese, copperware, and shipbuilding industries. Britain occupies a dominant position in the banking sector and in import and export trade."

	Figures are often the best illustration. Let us talk about figures.

	According to official materials from a memorandum published by the Secretariat of the Indian Government in July 1951, enterprises controlled by foreign capital account for 97 percent of enterprises in the Indian oil industry, 93 percent in the rubber industry, 90 percent in the match industry, 89 percent in the jute industry, 86 percent in the tea manufacturing industry, 73 percent in the mining industry, 62 percent in the coal industry, 54 percent in rubber plantations, 46 percent in banking, 43 percent in the electrical industry, 33 percent in machinery manufacturing, and 21 percent in the textile industry.

	The register of foreign securities and assets published by the Reserve Bank of India based on the situation as of June 30, 1948, gives us a clear picture of the extent of British and American capital control over the Indian economy.

	According to the materials in the register, the total amount of foreign private investment was 5.96 billion rupees (at the most recent exchange rate, one rupee equals 0.201 US dollars). Of this total amount of foreign private investment (many Indian newspapers believe that the figure of 5.96 billion rupees is an underestimation), Britain accounted for 72.4 percent and the United States accounted for 6.5 percent.

	This relationship between British and American investment indicated by the 1948 materials has not undergone any significant changes. According to the statement of the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Krishnamachari, on June 12, 1952, the amount of foreign investment in the recent four-year period was 300 million rupees, of which British companies accounted for 244.9 million rupees and American companies accounted for 32 million rupees.

	The figures in the Reserve Bank register on individual economic sectors provide an even clearer concept of the proportion of British and American capital in the Indian economy. Here are a few examples: of foreign investment in the processing and manufacturing industry, Britain accounts for 69.4 percent and the United States accounts for 7.3 percent; the figures for municipal utilities enterprises are even more obvious, with 94.8 percent of foreign investment being in the hands of Britain and the United States' share accounting for only 0.1 percent; in the transportation industry, Britain accounts for 74 percent and the United States accounts for 0.3 percent; in trade, Britain accounts for 78.8 percent and the United States accounts for 6 percent; in the mining industry, Britain accounts for 83.8 percent and the United States accounts for 1.8 percent.

	It is obvious that British capital controls the lifeline of the Indian economy. It should be noted that the materials cited above are not sufficient to exhaustively illustrate the scale of foreign, especially British, control over the Indian economy.

	As is well known, the method of controlling Indian enterprises through so-called "managing agencies" from abroad is very prevalent, and these "managing agencies" control a large amount of Indian capital and major economic sectors of India.

	In order to maintain and strengthen its position in India, British imperialism organizes a large number of joint British-Indian companies. The contract signed between the Imperial Chemical Trust and the Indian monopoly capitalist Tata for the manufacture of dyes is an example.

	Finally, this situation cannot be ignored either, namely, British financial capital maintains its dominant position in the Indian banking system. The largest British banks, such as the Imperial Bank of India, the Mercantile Bank of India, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, continue their activities in India.

	American imperialism has consistently attempted to undermine the position of British imperialism in India, striving to bring India under its sphere of influence. The more stubbornly the British Empire struggles to maintain its dominance in India, the more intense the offensive of American capital becomes. To judge what significance India has in the plans of American imperialism, one can refer to the statement made by US Supreme Court Justice Douglas in the summer of 1951 after traveling to Asian countries. He said: "India is now the key to opening Asia."

	In order to infiltrate India, American capital uses the same methods used by Britain, such as creating a large number of joint ventures with Indian capital. It is known that the American "Brannerd International Company" signed a contract with the Indian government for a joint venture company to build a manganese-iron factory in Orissa Province. According to this contract, American capital accounts for 51 percent of the shares and Indian capital accounts for 49 percent. The contract stipulates that 80 percent of the factory's products must be shipped to the United States. It is also known that two American oil companies have obtained leases for exploration and processing of petroleum.

	In order to consolidate its influence in India and expand the possibility of American capital expansion, the American ruling group provides extensive loans based on the policy of so-called technical "assistance" in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Point Four of the "Truman Doctrine." Regarding this point, the American ruling group adopts blackmail and coercive measures in order to force India to accept enslaving conditions and to make India's policies subordinate to American control.

	During the post-war period, American capital has sharply strengthened its offensive against the trade position of Britain. The United States has very significantly increased its proportion in the total value of India's foreign trade. According to materials from the first half of 1951, Britain accounted for 20 percent of the total value of India's foreign trade, exceeding the United States by only 0.1 percent.

	The strengthening of the role of the United States in India's foreign trade greatly troubles British imperialism. British newspapers have become alarmed, calling for urgent measures to counter the export of the dollar area. The question of these measures is the main subject discussed at the Imperial Conference currently being held in London (referring to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in December 1952 – translator).

	British imperialism possesses a very powerful tool in the struggle to counter the expansion of American foreign trade into the markets of the British Empire, especially the Indian market. This tool is first and foremost the imperial preference system, through which British goods imported into India bear less tax than American goods. The fact that India is a member of the Sterling Area also plays a significant role, and this makes it possible for the "City of London" to broadly influence India's foreign trade policy and monetary policy.

	What conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of the proportion of British capital and American capital in the Indian economy? The materials cited above convince us that, despite the strengthening of the offensive of American imperialism against British positions, British capital still occupies a dominant position in the Indian economy, and this situation provides a basis for the inference that Britain still occupies an overwhelming advantage in the Indian economy, despite the continuous infiltration of American capital into the Indian economy, and the facts show precisely this.

	This is the situation in India. Therefore, it should be admitted that there is a serious error in the article "Anglo-American Competition in India" published in the "New Times" magazine (September 3, 1952, No. 36). The authors of this article, Comrades Kuchinkov and Litov, cited materials on the strengthening penetration of American capital into India and presented a situation as if it could already be said that the influence of Britain and the United States in India was almost equal.

	Another conclusion can also be drawn, namely, because of the strengthening of the offensive of American capital against British positions in India, because of the stubborn attempts of the American ruling group to subject India to its influence and control, this offensive foreshadows the further intensification of Anglo-American contradictions, and thus, it also foreshadows the further intensification of Anglo-American competition.

    论英美在印度竞争的问题
    苏联  维克托罗夫
    英美矛盾的日益尖锐化是现代资本主义的特征。
    斯大林还在一九二八年就指示说，“美国资本主义和英国资本主义之间的矛盾，已成为资本主义阵营内种种矛盾的根本矛盾了”。一九三○年，斯大林在联共第十六次代表大会上谈到由于世界性的经济危机而使世界资本主义固有的矛盾尖锐化的特点时，曾重新强调了英、美矛盾的意义。他指示说，在最重要的帝国主义国家之间的矛盾中，美英矛盾是主要的矛盾。“无论在商品输出方面或资本输出方面，主要的斗争，都是英、美中间的斗争。对于这一点，拿关于商品和资本输出的任何一种经济报纸或文件来看，都不难明了。他们中间的斗争和主要的地方，就是南美洲、中国和老帝国主义国家的殖民地和被保护国。”
    在第二次世界大战以后，因战争的结果，欧洲的六个国家和包括中国在内的亚洲三个国家摆脱了资本主义体系，因而，英美帝国主义的竞争更加尖锐化了。美帝国主义和英帝国主义之间的矛盾获得了更残酷的性质，因为这种斗争是在缩小了的和解体了的资本主义体系中发生的。美国和英国统治集团所共同推行的侵略和发动战争的政策，不仅没有减弱而是更加强了它们之间的矛盾，引起了它们之间的帝国主义利益的冲突。
    在这两个帝国主义对手的斗争中，亚洲各国，特别是印度，占有最重要的地位。这个斗争进行了几十年，在战后时期特别猛烈地展开了。在谈到战后期间时，应当注意具有决定亚洲各国总情况的最重要的因素：即是在殖民地和附属国中摧毁帝国主义基石的民族解放运动的强有力的高涨。
    不言而喻，无论美帝国主义的政策或英帝国主义的政策，都是压制民族解放运动、奴役亚洲各民族的。帝国主义分子的这种目的的共同性，绝对不会消灭他们之间的矛盾。正是由于这些矛盾的发展，帝国主义之间斗争的发展，使帝国主义国家在执行镇压民族解放运动的政策中所担负的角色被揭露了。
    印度的情况是怎样的呢？毫无疑问，无论英帝国主义或美帝国主义都企图奴役这个国家。英国资本家追求着自己的帝国主义的目的，力图保持和巩固自己在印度的地位。美国资本家、美国的外交也展开了狂热的活动，以便能够更进一步深入印度市场，在印度夺取经济和政治地位。但是，绝对不能说，英美帝国主义者在印度拥有同等的地位。
    曾任印度在国际货币基金委员会中的委员的格扬·昌德去年十二月对巴特那城大学生演说时，曾这样谈到印度的情况。他说，英国“在印度国民经济中最重要的部门仍占有领导地位。英国控制着印度的黄麻、石油、煤炭、火柴、云母、锰、铜器和造船等工业。英国在银行界、在出入口贸易方面都占有主导的地位。”
    数字时常是最好的说明。我们谈谈数字吧。
    根据印度政府秘书处一九五一年七月所公布的备忘录的官方材料，由外国资本控制的企业，在印度石油工业企业中占百分之九十七，橡胶工业中占百分之九十三，火柴工业中占百分之九十，黄麻工业中占百分之八十九，制茶工业中占百分之八十六，采矿工业中占百分之七十三，煤炭工业中占百分之六十二，橡胶园中占百分之五十四，银行业中占百分之四十六，电气工业中占百分之四十三，机器制造业中占百分之三十三，纺织工业中占百分之二十一。
    印度储备银行根据一九四八年六月三十日的情况所公布的外国债券和资产登记表，给我们一幅鲜明的图画，说明英国资本和美国资本对印度经济控制的程度。
    根据登记表的材料，外国私人投资总计为五十九亿六千万卢比（按最近的行市一卢比等于零点二○一美元）。在这个外国私人投资的总额中（许多印度报纸认为五十九亿六千万卢比这个数字是缩小了的数字）英国占百分之七十二点四，美国占百分之六点五。
    一九四八年的材料所指出的英美投资之间的这种关系，没有发生任何巨大的变化。按照印度工商部长克里施纳马查里一九五二年六月十二日的声明，在最近四年期间，外国的投资额为三亿卢比，其中英国公司的数额为二亿四千四百九十万卢比，美国公司为三千二百万卢比。
    在储备银行登记表中关于个别经济部门的数字，给英国和美国资本在印度经济中的比重提供了更加鲜明的概念。这是几个例子：在加工制造业的外资中英国占百分之六十九点四，美国占百分之七点三；关于市政公用设备企业的数字更是明显，外国投资的百分之九十四点八是在英国的手中，美国的股份仅占百分之零点一；在运输业中，英国占百分之七十四，美国占百分之零点三；在贸易中英国占百分之七十八点八，美国占百分之六；在采矿工业中英国占百分之八十三点八，美国占百分之一点八。
    很明显，英国资本掌握了印度经济的命脉。应当注意，上面所引证的材料还不足以详尽无遗地说明外国，首先是英国，对印度经济控制的规模。
    如所周知，通过来自外国的所谓“管理处”控制印度企业的这种方式非常盛行，“管理处”控制着大量的印度资本及印度主要的经济部门。
    为了保持和加强自己在印度的地位，英帝国主义大量地组织合办的英印公司。帝国化学托拉斯和印度垄断资本家塔塔之间所签订的制造染料的合同，就是一个例子。
    最后，这种情况也是不容忽略的，即英国的金融资本在印度的银行系统中保持着自己的统治地位。最大的一些英国银行如印度帝国银行、印度麦加利银行、汇丰银行等在印度继续着自己的活动。
    美帝国主义一贯地企图破坏不列颠帝国主义在印度的地位，竭力要使印度处于自己的影响范围之内。不列颠帝国为保持自己在印度的统治地位的斗争愈是顽强，美国资本的进攻也就愈激烈。要判断印度在美帝国主义计划中有着怎样的意义，可以参照一下美国最高法院大法官道格拉斯一九五一年夏天在亚洲各国旅行后所发表的声明。他说：“印度现在是开启亚洲的钥匙”。
    为了渗入印度，美国资本使用着英国所使用的那套方法，如大量创办有印度资本参加的合办公司之类。大家知道，美国的“布瑞纳德国际公司”与印度政府签订了为在奥里萨省建设锰铁工厂的合办公司的合同。按照这个合同，美国资本的股份占百分之五十一，印度的股份占百分之四十九。在这个合同中，规定该厂生产品的百分之八十都要运到美国去。大家也知道，两个美国石油公司获有勘察和加工制造石油的租借权。
    为了巩固自己在印度的影响和扩大美国资本扩张的可能性，美国统治集团根据国际复兴银行和“杜鲁门施政方针”第四点中所谓技术“援助”的方针，广泛地给与贷款。关于这一点，美国统治集团采取了敲诈和强迫的手段，以便迫使印度接受奴役的条件和使印度的政策屈服于美国的支配之下。
    战后期间，美国资本急剧地加强了自己对英国贸易地位的进攻。美国非常显著地提高了自己在印度对外贸易总值中的比重。根据一九五一年前半年的材料，英国在印度对外贸易总值中的占百分之二十，仅超过美国百分之零点一。
    美国在印度对外贸易中的作用的加强，使英国帝国主义大感烦恼。英国的报纸惊慌不安起来，它们呼吁采取紧急措施以对抗美元区域的输出。关于这些措施问题，就是现在在伦敦召开的帝国会议（指一九五二年十二月召开的英联邦总理会议——译者）所讨论的主要对象。
    英帝国主义在对抗美国向不列颠帝国市场，特别是向印度市场的对外贸易的扩张的斗争中，拥有一个很有力的工具。这个工具首先就是帝国的特惠制，借助这种特惠制输入印度的英国商品，比美国负担较少的税额。印度是英镑集团成员的这一事实也起着不小的作用，而且这使“伦敦城”有可能广泛影响印度的对外贸易政策和货币政策。
    从印度经济中英国资本与美国资本的比重的对比中，将会得出怎样的结论呢？上面引用的材料使我们确信，尽管美帝国主义加强对英国地位的进攻，英国资本在印度经济中仍然占有统治的地位，这种情况对于在美国资本不断渗入印度经济的情况下，英国在印度经济中仍占有压倒优势的这种推断提供了根据，而事实所表明的也正是如此。
    印度的情况就是这样。因此，应当承认“新时代”杂志（一九五二年九月三日，第三十六期）所发表的“英、美在印度的竞争”一文的严重错误。该文作者库秦科夫同志和里托夫同志引证了关于美国资本加强渗入印度的材料，提出了好像已经能够说几乎英国和美国在印度的影响趋于相等的情况。
    由于美国资本加强对不列颠在印度的地位的进攻，由于美国统治集团顽强地企图把印度屈服在自己的影响下和支配下，也得出了另一个结论，即是这种进攻预兆着英、美矛盾的进一步尖锐化，因而，也预兆着英、美的竞争的进一步尖锐化。
