    North China People's Revolutionary University Concludes Operations

    The North China People's Revolutionary University has completed its historical mission and, in accordance with instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced its closure on January 13.

    The North China People's Revolutionary University was established in January 1949 in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Since its establishment, under the direct leadership of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, it has adhered to the principle of striving for, uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals with Marxism-Leninism. By February 1952, it had trained four classes of young intellectuals, and ran three sessions of the Political Research Institute, and one session of the Administrative College, initially educating and transforming more than 22,000 old intellectuals of various types. At the time of graduation, approximately 95 percent of the students obeyed organizational assignments and happily participated in the country's various construction works. More than 400 people voluntarily participated in the front-line and logistics work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea upon graduation. These graduated students have continued to receive training and education in various revolutionary work positions, and the vast majority have worked actively, some have become model workers, and some have made meritorious service and received awards on the Korean front. This is inseparable from the school's diligent education and transformation. After the school was officially announced to be closed, all staff members held a closing meeting on the 13th of this month. Comrade Liu Lantao, the president of the university, attended and delivered a speech. Everyone discussed Liu's speech separately and unanimously expressed their support for the decision of the CPC Central Committee and guaranteed to meet the new tasks given by the Party with redoubled confidence and courage.
