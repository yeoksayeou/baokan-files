Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 26th: According to TASS, Soviet newspapers published editorials on the 23rd commenting on the communique issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the USSR regarding the results of the implementation of the 1952 National Economic Development Plan. The "Pravda" editorial pointed out: "The annual plan for the total industrial output in 1952 was fulfilled by 101 percent. It should be remembered that the plan for the total industrial output in 1951 was also overfulfilled. Therefore, the targets for the first two years of the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan have been overfulfilled, thus creating favorable conditions for completing the entire Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule." The editorial pointed out: "Comrade Stalin taught us that the purpose of socialist production is not profit, but man and his needs, that is, satisfying the material and cultural needs of man. The achievements in all sectors of the national economy have further improved the material life and cultural level of Soviet society. This is a vivid proof of the operation of the basic socialist economic law."

The "Izvestia" editorial said: "All our achievements have been obtained thanks to the wise leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin in building communism, thanks to the ever-increasing political and production activity of the working people and their enthusiastic labor. The amazing production enthusiasm of the working masses is vividly manifested in the nationwide socialist competition to fulfill and overfulfill the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan."

The "Trud" editorial pointed out: "The achievements of the Soviet Union have inspired the working people of the people's democratic countries who are building socialism, and also inspired all progressive mankind who are fighting for peace, democracy, and against capitalist enslavement. The communique of the Central Statistical Bureau is a convincing document showing the great power of the basic socialist economic law revealed by Comrade Stalin." The editorial also urged people's organizations and trade union organizations to improve the leadership of socialist competition, support and promote various advanced production methods and the valuable suggestions put forward by production innovators.

    苏联新五年计划头两年超额完成
    社会主义基本经济法则发生作用的明证
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十三日苏联各报纷纷发表社论，评论苏联部长会议中央统计局发表的一九五二年发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报。真理报社论指出：一九五二年工业全年总产量计划完成了百分之一○一。应当记得，一九五一年工业总产量计划也是超额完成的。因此，第五个斯大林五年计划头两年的目标已经超额完成了，这样就为提前完成整个五年计划创造了良好的条件。社论指出：斯大林同志教导我们说，社会主义生产的目的不是利润，而是人及其需要，即满足人的物质和文化的需要。国民经济各部门的成就使得苏维埃社会的物质生活和文化水平有了进一步的提高。这是社会主义基本经济法则发生作用的生动证明。
    消息报发表社论说：我们的一切成就之所以能够获得，都由于有了列宁和斯大林的党在建设共产主义中的英明领导，由于劳动人民不断增长的政治和生产积极性和他们的热情充沛的劳动。在争取完成和超额完成第五个斯大林五年计划的全国规模的社会主义竞赛中，生动地表现了劳动群众的惊人的生产热情。
    劳动报发表社论指出：苏联的成就鼓舞了各个正在建设社会主义的人民民主国家的劳动人民，也鼓舞了全体为和平、民主、反对资本主义奴役而斗争的进步人类。中央统计局的公报是一个令人信服的文件，显示了斯大林同志所揭示的社会主义基本经济法则的伟大力量。社论并敦促各人民团体和工会组织改善社会主义竞赛的领导工作，支持并推广各种先进生产方法和生产革新者们所提出的宝贵建议。
