Welcoming the Victorious Year of 1953
Female Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Guo Junqing

    The year 1952 has passed in victory, and the new year of 1953 has arrived.
    At this important moment, people always like to look back on the past days. Like the people of the whole country, I recall the past three years with extremely happy and excited feelings. Because these three years are the happiest three years of my life; our beloved motherland has achieved amazing and great accomplishments.
    I am the daughter of a poor peasant family in the old days. I still clearly remember the dilapidated and impoverished scene of old China, and the days of swallowing chaff and eating bran. But since the founding of the new China three years ago, new changes have taken place every minute on every inch of the motherland's land. Every year brings the people a better life and greater happiness. Take the Huai River, for example. When we went south in 1949, we watched its flood like a fierce dragon drowning thousands of villages of all sizes on both sides, blocking our troops there. But when I took the train there in 1951, where was the shadow of the flood? The banks of the Huai River were already a boundless expanse of golden wheat waves. Especially when I received letters from my hometown in the Northeast, one good news after another. The place that used to be a wilderness has now established a lively collective farm, and the rumbling tractors are running all day long; the sandy land that used to be considered useless has now been planted with hundreds of miles of forest. Some places have changed so much that I can hardly believe it. For example, Yichun City, a few years ago there were only a few broken thatched houses there, now there are streets, buildings, and schools, it's really prosperous. It was built so fast that I flipped through several maps, and they haven't had time to mark it on them. I opened a few newspapers of the last month of the year, and every page was full of reports of victories in production and construction. From the banks of the Songhua River to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, from state-owned farms in Xinjiang to textile factories in Shanghai, news of production victories are being sent everywhere. In the past three years, the motherland has been full of brilliant achievements until the last minute!
    I am even more excited when I think of the greater strength of our troops in the past three years. We have achieved great results in training, suppressing bandits, and cultural studies. Half a year ago, I was still in the third grade of elementary school, but after less than four months of study, my Chinese proficiency reached the level of graduating from higher elementary school. In the past, I couldn't even take notes, but today I can not only take notes, but also write manuscripts, and I can also make preliminary work plans and summary reports. What excites me is not my own achievements, but that every comrade in the army has achieved such amazing progress. The level of education has improved so rapidly, and military technology and political level have been accelerated even more. As the soldiers said: Now our People's Liberation Army is like a tiger with wings, and every one of us deeply feels that the motherland's national defense has become an impregnable fortress, unprecedentedly consolidated!
    Three years is just a blink of an eye in history, but in such a short period of time, and while carrying out the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the motherland has completed great undertakings that have never been done in history! I have personally experienced the boundaries between the new and old societies. Looking back on these glorious achievements, I feel even more deeply: how superior our people's democratic dictatorship system is, how correct our Party is, and how lovely and great our motherland is!
    The victorious and glorious three years have passed, and the new year of 1953 will be even more glorious and brilliant. The large-scale construction of the motherland that we have been looking forward to in arduous battles and selfless labor for many years will begin in this new year. The further prosperity and strength of the motherland has been determined in Chairman Mao's great plan, and the beautiful prospects of the motherland can already be seen in this year. In order to defend the happy life and large-scale construction of the motherland, I will definitely, together with all comrades of the People's Liberation Army, further improve our military and political level and work hard to learn culture in 1953. I am a glorious soldier of the national defense army, and every one of our soldiers bears the important responsibility of defending the motherland on our shoulders. We must do our best to make the motherland's national defense more consolidated and reliable. If any aggressor dares to invade the motherland, we will resolutely wipe them out under our feet.
    On this bright morning of the first day of 1953, let us first congratulate our most beloved father and leader—the great Chairman Mao—with infinite gratitude. All our achievements are inseparable from his name. I sincerely wish him good health and longevity!
    Friends! I wish you all progress in the New Year, and I wish the great motherland infinite prosperity! I wish the cause of world peace a glorious victory!

    迎接胜利的一九五三年
    中国人民解放军女战斗英雄  郭俊卿
    一九五二年在胜利中过去，新的一九五三年来到了。
    在这重要的时刻，人们总爱回顾一下已往的日子。我和全国的人民一样，是带着极快乐激动的心情回想过去的三年的。因为这三年是我一生中最幸福的三个年份；我们亲爱的祖国获得了惊人的、伟大的成就。
    我是旧时一家贫农的女儿，旧中国破烂贫困的景象，和吞糠咽菜的日子，我现在还清楚地记得。但是从三年前新中国成立以后，每一分钟，在祖国的每一寸土地上都起了新的变化。每一年总给人民带来更好的生活和更大的幸福。就拿淮河说吧，一九四九年我们南下的时候，还眼看着它的洪水像条凶龙似的把两岸的几千个大小乡村给淹了，把我们的队伍也堵在那儿，但是一九五一年我坐火车经过那儿，哪里还有洪水的影子？淮河两岸已是望不到边的、滚滚的一片金黄色麦浪了。特别我接到从家乡东北来的信，喜事一串一串的。从前是一片荒野的地方，现在已经建立了热闹的集体农场，轰隆隆的拖拉机成天跑个不停；从前觉得没用的沙地里，现在已经种上了几百里长的树林。有些地方更变的几乎使我不敢相信了。比方伊春城吧，几年前那儿还只有几间破草房，现在又是街道楼房，又是学校，真繁荣呢。它建设得这么快，我翻了几本地图，上面都还没来得及把它标出来。我翻开了一年中最后一月的几份报纸，每版上都满满地挤着生产建设胜利的报道。从松花江岸到云贵高原，从新疆的国营农场到上海的纺织工厂，到处都发出生产胜利的消息。祖国过去三年，到最后一分钟都是充满着光辉成就的！
    我回想到三年来我们部队的更加强大，心里更是兴奋。在练兵、剿匪、文化学习中，我们都取得了巨大的成绩。半年前，我还在初小三年级，但经过不到四个月的学习，我的语文程度就达到了高小毕业的水平。过去我连笔记都不能记，今天不但能记笔记，还能写稿，而且可以初步作工作计划和总结报告了。使我兴奋的不是我自己的成绩，而是全军每一个同志，都获得了这样的惊人进步。文化程度这样迅速地提高，军事技术和政治水平更是加速地提高了。像战士们说的：现在咱们解放军好比老虎又长上了翅膀，我们每一个同志都深深地感到：祖国的国防已经成了铜墙铁壁，空前地巩固了！
    三年时间在历史上，只不过是一转眼间，可是祖国在这样短促的时间里，而且在进行着抗美援朝战争的情况下，却完成了历史上从没能做到的伟大事业！我亲身经历过新、旧社会的界限，回顾这些光辉的成就，我更加深深感到：我们的人民民主专政制度多么优越，我们的党多么正确，我们的祖国是多么可爱和伟大啊！
    胜利辉煌的三年过去了，新的一九五三年将更加光辉、更加灿烂。多少年来我们在艰苦战斗中，在忘我劳动中所一直盼望着的祖国大规模建设，将要在这新来的一年中开始。祖国的进一步富强和繁荣，已经在毛主席的伟大计划中确定，祖国美丽的远景在这一年中已经可以望得到了。为了保卫祖国的幸福生活和大规模建设，我一定和人民解放军的全体同志一道，在一九五三年中，要更加提高军事、政治水平，努力学习文化。我是个光荣的国防军战士，在我们每个战士的肩上担负着保卫祖国的重大责任，我们一定要尽全力来使祖国国防更加巩固牢靠。如果任何侵略者敢来侵犯祖国，就坚决地把它消灭在我们脚下。
    在这一九五三年的第一个光明的清晨，让我们以无限感激的心情，首先祝贺我们最敬爱的父亲和领袖——伟大的毛主席，所有我们的一切成就都是和他的名字分不开的，我衷心地祝贺他身体健康！万寿无疆！
    朋友们！祝大家新年进步，祝伟大祖国无限富强！祝世界和平事业光辉胜利！
