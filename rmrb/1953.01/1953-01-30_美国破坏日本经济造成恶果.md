Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. F. Kudryavtsev wrote in "Izvestia": American imperialists, taking advantage of their occupation of Japan, established control over Japan's major industries. They deliberately isolated Japan from its historically traditional markets for purchasing raw materials and selling goods—such as China—forcing Japan to purchase raw materials and food from the United States at high prices, thereby subordinating it to the American economy. This helped the American ruling group develop the Japanese economy in a one-sided way through military procurement orders. Kudryavtsev recalled: After the war, the Japanese ruling group was overjoyed to receive large numbers of American military orders due to the Korean War. But this does not mean the revitalization of the Japanese economy, which was destroyed by the war and years of tyranny by the American occupiers. Despite the development of heavy industry due to military orders, unemployment is becoming increasingly serious throughout the country. The number of unemployed is increasing due to the reduction in civilian production and currently stands at ten million. Even according to the exaggerated official figures, the people's living standards are only 80% of the pre-war level.

Kudryavtsev continued: American imperialists are not only aggressors against Japan but also its economic destroyers. The destructive role of American imperialism is particularly evident in Japan's foreign trade, which has always been very important to Japan. The direct result of American imperialists' sabotage of Japanese foreign trade is that Japan's foreign trade position is very unstable. American monopoly capitalists dump goods that they cannot sell elsewhere in the Japanese market. They also use their special position in the Japanese market to arbitrarily raise prices. At the same time, high U.S. tariffs prevent Japanese goods from entering the U.S. market. The result is that Japan has to buy large quantities of food and raw materials in dollars, while having to sell its goods to the sterling area. This is clearly beneficial to American monopoly capitalists, as they can use Japan as a battering ram to attack Britain's traditional markets, especially in Southeast Asia. But it is equally obvious that this greatly increases Japan's dollar deficit.

Kudryavtsev pointed out that Japan has already made significant concessions to Britain in the Southeast Asian market; he also pointed out that it is now difficult to further expand trade in this region, as Japanese goods imports to many sterling areas are greatly restricted. In addition, Japan's traditional export goods (textiles) to some underdeveloped country markets are facing increasing competition from local products in the post-war years. In terms of increasing exports of heavy industrial products, Japan is facing fierce competition from British companies.

Kudryavtsev said: In this regard, those more far-sighted Japanese businessmen have repeatedly raised the issue of conducting normal trade with the People's Republic of China. The pressure exerted by the Japanese public on this issue is so great that the U.S. authorities recently had to lift the ban on certain minor Japanese goods on the embargo list to appease the people. Needless to say, this cannot solve the complex problem of foreign trade on which most of the entire Japanese economy depends. Kudryavtsev concluded: When Japan has to rely on American war orders and American imports, its happiness is bound to be unstable and false; similarly, its economy will inevitably fall into a deep state of crisis.

    美国破坏日本经济造成恶果
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：弗·库德里雅夫采夫在“消息报”写道：美帝国主义者利用对日本的占领建立对日本主要工业的控制权。他们故意把日本跟它在历史传统上购买原料和销售商品的市场——例如中国——隔离开来，迫使日本以高价在美国购买原料和粮食，从而使它从属于美国的经济。这帮助了美国统治集团用订购军用品的办法使日本经济得到片面的发展。库德里雅夫采夫追述说：战后日本统治集团对于由于朝鲜战争而获得大批美国军事订货高兴得要命。但这并不意味着因战争和美国占领者的几年暴政而遭到破坏的日本经济的复兴。尽管重工业由于军事订货而有所发展，但失业现象在全国越来越严重。失业人数由于民用生产的减少而日益增加，目前已高达一千万人。即使根据官方夸大的数字，人民生活水平也不过只有战前水平的百分之八十。
    库德里雅夫采夫继续说：美帝国主义者对日本不仅是侵略者，并且还是它的经济的破坏者。美帝国主义者的这个破坏者的作用在日本对外贸易方面特别明显，而对外贸易对日本一向是非常重要的。美帝国主义者破坏日本对外贸易的直接结果，使得日本对外贸易的地位很不稳固。美国垄断资本家把他们在旁的地方推销不了的东西拿到日本市场上来倾销。他们还利用他们在日本市场上的特殊地位任意抬高价格。同时，美国高额关税使日本货物无法进入美国市场。结果便是：日本一方面要以美元购买大宗食粮和原料，同时却不得不以它的货物向英镑区出售。这显然对美国垄断资本家有利，因为他们这样就能利用日本做为攻打英国传统的市场首先是在东南亚的市场的攻城槌。但是这样就足以大大地增加日本的美元亏空，这也是同样明显的事。
    库德里雅夫采夫指出，日本已使英国在东南亚市场作了很大的让步；同时他还指出，现在要在这个区域进一步扩大贸易已不大行了，因为日本货向许多英镑地区的进口大大地受了限制。此外，日本对于一些经济落后国家市场的传统的出口货（纺织品）在战后年代正受到当地产品的日益增加的竞争。在增加重工业产品的出口方面，日本又受到英国公司的激烈竞争。
    库德里雅夫采夫说：在这方面，那些比较有远见的日本商人都屡次提出要和中华人民共和国进行正常贸易的问题。日本公众在这个问题上施加的压力很大，以致美国当局为了笼络人心起见最近不得不解除对中国禁运单中的某些次要的日本货的禁令。不用说，这决不能解决整个日本经济大部分所依赖的对外贸易那样复杂的问题。库德里雅夫采夫在结语中说：当日本必须依靠美国战争订货和美国进口货的时候，它的幸福就必然是不稳定的和虚伪的，同样，它的经济就不可避免地要陷入一种深重的危机状态中。
