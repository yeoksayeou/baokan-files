Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th. The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Finance and Economics Committee focused on inspecting capital construction work in the Southwest Region and Chongqing Municipality last December. This inspection identified the reasons for the slow progress of capital construction projects and the large accumulation of materials and funds in the inspected units, providing a reliable basis for improving future work. For example, during this inspection, it was discovered that the No. 610 Cotton Mill was seriously affected by the unclear purpose of the new construction project. The No. 610 Cotton Mill only knew that it was going to build a cloth factory, but it did not consider the various equipment needed in the factory building (such as ventilation equipment) in advance. As a result, the design work, which was originally scheduled to be completed in April 1952, is still questionable whether it can be completed by June 1953; the cloth machines that need to be installed have already been shipped, but the factory building construction project has not yet been able to sign a complete contract with the construction unit. Another example is that 30 percent of the design blueprints of the No. 101 Factory contained errors. The construction of workers' residences in Xiaolongkan was reworked more than 40 times. In terms of material supply, due to the lack of necessary plans, there were both work stoppages waiting for materials and material accumulation.

To ensure project quality, project progress, rational use of funds, and correct completion of the state's capital construction plan, the Southwest Finance and Economics Committee has decided to strengthen the inspection of capital construction work and regard inspection work as a regular and important leadership method. The Capital Construction Department of the Southwest Finance and Economics Committee has established four inspection groups for heavy industry, machinery industry, fuel industry, and light industry and textiles, which regularly go deep into the field to understand the situation, analyze and study the problems existing in capital construction, and provide opinions on improving work, which has played a certain role in promoting capital construction work.

This inspection was carried out by five inspection groups composed of cadres drawn from the Southwest Finance Department, the Capital Construction Department of the Southwest Finance and Economics Committee, the Southwest Iron and Steel, Textile, and Electric Power Administrations, the Southwest District Branch and Chongqing Branch of the Bank of Communications, and relevant units in Chongqing Municipality. The inspection groups adopted methods such as holding cadre symposiums, visiting workers, checking accounts, and inspecting construction sites, focusing on inspecting six capital construction units.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th. The Southwest Region is actively carrying out the work of returning technical personnel to their units. The Personnel Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and the Organization Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee have jointly formed a working group for the return of basic construction science and engineering technical cadres to handle the work of quickly returning technical cadres to their units. At the same time, another working group was formed to go to Yunnan, Xikang and other places to conduct in-depth investigations and understand the situation of technical cadres, and accelerate the assistance in the transfer.

Since the People's Daily published an editorial on June 14th, "Put Specialized Technical Talents in the Posts Most Needed for Economic Construction," the Personnel Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and the Organization Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee have successively issued three instructions on the rational use and investigation and registration of technical personnel, and invited responsible cadres from the Southwest first-level organs to a meeting, emphasizing the great significance of the return of technical cadres to their units; then convened a meeting of personnel cadres from the Southwest first-level organs to deeply understand the use of technical cadres; and held a symposium of technical cadres to encourage them to return to their technical work posts. Due to the close attention of the leadership, the technical cadres who have returned to their units at the Southwest first-level organs have accounted for 65 percent of those who should return, and the Southwest Water Conservancy Department and the Southwest Finance Department quickly transferred more than 30 technical cadres.

However, in the process of registration and transfer, the leading personnel of many units in various parts of the Southwest had serious departmentalism and took various measures to delay. A mechanical technician working in the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance requested to return to his unit, but the department firmly refused and ordered him to make a self-criticism. The Inland Navigation Bureau of the Southwest Ministry of Communications even refused to register technical cadres and did not allow the technical cadres of the bureau to participate in the symposium of returned cadres from the Southwest first-level organs. Then, it transferred four technical personnel who had studied hydropower to other places to do purchasing work. Some units verbally agreed to transfer, but delayed on various pretexts.

Recently, in order to resolutely correct the above situation and complete the return work quickly, the Organization Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee once again issued instructions on the method of supplementing the registration and handling the return of cadres, and plans to complete the transfer work in the first quarter of this year. Now, in addition to the rapid progress of the transfer work in the Southwest first-level organs, many departments in the Southwest provinces have also grasped the work and completed the investigation, registration, and review stages, and have begun to actively carry out the transfer work.

    西南区重点检查基本建设工作
    全区技术人员归队工作正在积极进行
    【新华社重庆十日电】西南军政委员会财政经济委员会去年十二月重点检查了西南区和重庆市的基本建设工作。这次检查找出了所检查的各单位基本建设工程进展迟缓、材料资金大量积压的原因，为改进今后工作提供了可靠的根据。如在这次检查中，发现六一零纱厂因新建工程目的性不明确，严重地影响了工程的进展。六一零纱厂只知道要建布厂，但对厂房内所需各种设备（如通风设备），事先却没有考虑，结果，原定一九五二年四月完成的设计工作，到一九五三年六月能否全部完成还是问题；需要安装的布机早已运到，而厂房修建工程到现在还不能与承建单位全部签订合同。又如一零一厂设计蓝图发生错误的有百分之三十。小龙坎工人住宅的建筑，返工达四十余次。在器材供应方面，由于缺乏必要的计划，同时出现了停工待料和器材积压的现象。
    西南财政经济委员会为了保证工程质量、工程进度、合理使用资金、正确完成国家基本建设计划，已决定加强基本建设的检查工作，把检查工作作为经常的重要领导方法之一。西南财政经济委员会基本建设处已成立了重工业、机械工业、燃料工业、轻工纺织等四个检查组，经常深入现场了解情况，分析研究基本建设中存在的问题，提供改进工作的意见，对基本建设工作已起了一定的推动作用。
    这次检查由西南财政部、西南财政经济委员会基本建设处、西南钢铁、纺织、电业等管理局，交通银行西南区行和重庆分行，以及重庆市有关单位抽调干部组成五个检查小组，负责进行。各检查小组采取了举行干部座谈会、访问工人、查对账目、视察工地等方式，重点检查了六个基本建设单位。
    【新华社重庆九日电】西南区正在积极进行技术人员归队工作。西南军政委员会人事部和中共中央西南局组织部已联合组成基本建设理工技术干部归队工作组，专门处理技术干部迅速归队工作；同时又另外组成工作组赴云南、西康等地深入调查了解技术干部情况，加速协助抽调。
    自去年六月十四日人民日报发表“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论后，西南军政委员会人事部和中共中央西南局组织部就先后三次发出关于合理使用和调查登记技术人员的指示，并邀集西南一级机关负责干部开会，强调说明技术干部归队的重大意义；然后召集西南一级机关人事干部会议，深入了解技术干部使用情况；又召开技术干部座谈会，鼓励他们回到技术工作岗位上去。由于领导方面抓得紧，西南一级机关已归队的技术干部已占应归队的百分之六十五，西南水利部和西南财政部很快就调出技术干部三十多人。
    但是，在登记和抽调过程中，西南各地许多单位的领导人员曾产生严重的本位主义思想，采取各种办法拖延。在四川省财政厅工作的一个机械技术人员要求归队，该厅坚不允许，反令其作检讨。西南交通部内河航务局甚至拒绝登记技术干部，不许该局技术干部参加西南一级机关归队干部座谈会，接着又把四个学水力发电应该归队的技术人员调到外地去作采购工作。有的单位口头答应抽调，但又借故拖延。
    最近，为了坚决纠正上述情况，使归队工作迅速完成，中共中央西南局组织部再次发出补行登记和处理归队干部的办法指示，并拟在本年第一季度全部完成抽调工作。现在，除西南一级机关抽调工作进展很快外，西南各省的许多部门也已抓紧完成了调查、登记、审核阶段，开始积极进行抽调工作。
