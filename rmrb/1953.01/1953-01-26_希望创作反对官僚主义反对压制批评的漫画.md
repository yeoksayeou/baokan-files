    Hope for Creation of Cartoons Opposing Bureaucratism and Suppressing Criticism

    To the Editor: The several cartoons from the Soviet magazine "Crocodile" reprinted in the "People's Daily" on December 23, 1952 – "Portraits of Suppressors of Criticism" – vividly, profoundly, and sharply satirized and criticized those who suppress criticism. After reading them, the readers felt disgusted and hateful toward these suppressors of criticism, thereby greatly encouraging the readers' emotions to resolutely fight against them. These highly ideological works powerfully cooperated with the current political tasks, clearing the road for the country's construction cause. Therefore, I am reminded that in the motherland, which is now entering large-scale capital construction, aren't there also all kinds of suppressors of criticism and bureaucrats? They are hindering our great construction cause, causing incalculable losses to the country and the people! For example, the recently handled case of Wang Jingrong, stationmaster of the Tongchuan Transfer Station of the Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau Transportation and Sales Company, and personnel officer Ma Guorong, who suppressed criticism and took extremely vile actions of retaliation against Comrade Zhu Min, who offered criticism. Shouldn't this be criticized with the weapon of cartoons? I hope that our cartoonists will pick up their brushes and actively create cartoons with high ideological content.

    希望创作反对官僚主义反对压制批评的漫画
    编辑同志：一九五二年十二月二十三日“人民日报”上转载苏联“鳄鱼”杂志的几幅漫画——“压制批评者群像”，生动地、深刻地而又尖锐地讽刺和批评了压制批评者，使读者看了之后，对这些压制批评者感到厌恶和憎恨，从而大大地鼓舞了读者们对他们进行坚决斗争的情绪。这些有高度思想性的作品，有力地配合了当前的政治任务，为国家的建设事业扫清道路。因此联想到正进入大规模基本建设的祖国里，不是也存在着形形色色的压制批评者和官僚主义者吗？他们正在阻碍我们伟大的建设事业，给国家、人民造成难以估计的损失！如最近处理的西北石油管理局运销公司铜川转运站站长王景荣和人事员马国荣压制批评，对批评者朱珉同志采取了极端恶劣的打击和报复行为，这难道不该用漫画这个武器来进行批评吗？我希望我们的漫画家们拿起画笔，积极地创作有高度思想性的漫画。    崔光仁
