Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization issued a joint notice on publicizing the Spring Festival solar eclipse. The full text is as follows:

On the morning of February 14th this year (i.e., the first day of the lunar new year), a partial solar eclipse can be seen in vast areas of our country (except Xinjiang and Tibet). In order to popularize scientific knowledge and eliminate the superstition about solar eclipses among some of the people, the local committees of the Youth League, cultural centers, cultural stations, and science and technology popularization associations in the partial solar eclipse areas should unite and mobilize scientific workers, cultural and educational workers, and Youth League members to carry out scientific publicity about solar eclipses from now until the solar eclipse occurs. This is to make the broad masses of the people know that a solar eclipse is an ordinary natural phenomenon whose occurrence time can be calculated in advance according to scientific knowledge, to understand why solar eclipses occur and other related astronomical knowledge, and thus improve the people's (especially young people's and children's) understanding of science and their desire to understand natural phenomena and natural laws. The specific methods are as follows: 1. According to the稿件(drafts) of Xinhua News Agency and the materials for publicizing solar eclipses published in the second issue of the 1953 Current Affairs Handbook, use reports, broadcasts, blackboards, etc.; and use existing solar eclipse wall charts, slides, and models in various places, or make simple instruments to explain solar eclipses and the structure of the solar system, to organize exhibitions or performances, etc.; local youth and children's newspapers and periodicals should publish popular articles explaining the solar eclipse phenomenon to generally publicize the Spring Festival solar eclipse and the reasons for solar eclipses. In the publicity, efforts should be made to seek the guidance of local scientists, and to ensure that all Youth League members participate in the publicity and that all Young Pioneers receive education. 2. If the weather is clear during the Spring Festival, small-scale solar eclipse observations can be organized to observe the time of the initial eclipse, the end of the eclipse, and the solar eclipse situation to confirm the correctness of scientific predictions. Local committees of the Youth League should organize Young Pioneers and primary and secondary school students to observe this solar eclipse. 3. There will be a total lunar eclipse on the morning of January 30th, which can be explained in conjunction with the publicity of the solar eclipse.

    发出宣传春节日食的联合通知
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府文化部、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国科学技术普及协会发出宣传春节日食的联合通知。全文如下：
    今年二月十四日（即阴历元旦）的早晨，在我国的广大地区（除新疆、西藏外）都能看到日偏食。为了普及科学知识，消除一部分人民群众中关于日食的迷信，在日偏食区的各地团委、文化馆、文化站和科学技术普及协会应联合起来，发动科学工作者、文教工作者和青年团员，从现在起到日食前进行关于日食的科学宣传，使广大人民知道日食是一个可以按照科学知识预先算出发生时间的普通自然现象，知道为什么发生日食和其他有关的天文知识，从而提高人民（尤其是青年和少年）对科学的认识和了解自然现象、自然规律的要求。具体办法如下：一、根据新华社的稿件和时事手册一九五三年第二期刊载的宣传日食的资料，通过报告、广播黑板报等方式；并利用各地原有的日食挂图、幻灯片和模型、或自制简单的说明日食和太阳系构造的仪器，组织展览会或表演会等；各地青年、少年儿童报刊要刊载解释日食现象的通俗文章，普遍宣传春节日食情况及日食原因。在宣传中应当努力争取当地科学家的指导，并且要做到青年团员都能参加宣传，少年儿童队员全体受到教育。二、如春节天气晴朗，可组织小规模的日食观测，观测日食的初亏、复圆的时间和日食情况，以证实科学预见的正确。各地团委要组织少年儿童队员和小学初中学生观测这次日食。三、一月三十日的早晨有月全食，在宣传日食时可结合进行解释。
