    Anshan Steel Promotes Mass Mechanization Movement in Small Rolling Mills
    Awarding Advanced Producers Zhang Mingshan and Over 100 Others
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a promotion and awards conference on January 30th to promote the advanced experience of the mass mechanization movement in the company's small rolling mill and to reward advanced producers such as Zhang Mingshan, who have made creative achievements in the mass mechanization movement. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the National Committee of the China Metal and Smelting Workers' Union, and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions sent telegrams or letters to congratulate the conference. The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Anshan Municipal People's Government presented banners to the small rolling mill as awards. At the meeting, Han Tianshi, secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and others spoke, calling on all factories and mines to learn from the small rolling mill and promote this mass mechanization movement. Zhang Mingshan, a special-class labor model of Anshan City and creator of the anti-circumferential disc of the rolling mill, stated on behalf of all workers in the small rolling mill that they are determined to strive to fully mechanize and automate the entire production process of the plant within six months.
    The mass mechanization movement carried out by the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill is a successful experience in fully mobilizing the masses of workers and technical personnel to systematically transform the old rolling mill. The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill is an old-fashioned rolling mill, and most of the production processes in the past were operated manually, resulting in low production efficiency. Workers had to work at temperatures of over 1,200 degrees Celsius, which was not only extremely tiring but also often caused accidents. Since liberation, although the small rolling mill has made great improvements in equipment and welfare, 102 workers have still been scalded, crushed, and suffered from occupational diseases such as back pain and leg pain during operation. Old worker Zhang Mingshan, who has worked in the small rolling mill for more than 20 years, knows the dangers and pain of rolling mill workers in their work. After liberation, under the education of the Party, Zhang Mingshan's enthusiasm was greatly enhanced, and he was determined to find a way to change this harsh production situation. After more than three years of painstaking research, with the help of Soviet experts, he finally succeeded in trial-producing the anti-circumferential disc of the rolling mill on September 14, 1952. Zhang Mingshan's creation not only saved 70% of the labor force, greatly increased the output and quality of steel, but also paved the way for the complete mechanization of the small rolling mill's production process. After Zhang Mingshan's successful creation of the anti-circumferential disc, the small rolling mill established an automation working group, went deep into the workshop, mobilized workers to propose suggestions for mechanization and automation, and organized multi-trade technical groups to mobilize workers to solve various technical difficulties. From the factory director to the workers, the entire factory participated in this mechanization and automation movement. During the movement, new inventions and creations continued to emerge. Advanced electrical worker Sun Shiping created an automatic iron-picking machine, heating worker Lu Naitao and technician Wu Liangya and others created a steel-pushing machine for the heating furnace, Zhang Zhushan improved the vertical circumferential disc, and welder Han Changxin and technician Miao Zhiming created a rough-rolling steel turning machine, etc. On January 29th of this year, workers in the second workshop of the plant created a sliding plate for the roughing mill and a vertical circumferential disc. In total, from January to September 1952, the employees of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill created 15 mechanical equipment for production mechanization and improved 23 mechanical equipment. Through this mass mechanization movement, several major processes of the plant, such as heating furnace, rough rolling, light rolling, and shearing, have been completely mechanized. Calculating only one of these items, the factory can create 74.2 billion yuan of wealth for the country in one year. This year, the factory's production task for January was completed two days ahead of schedule.

    鞍钢推广小型轧钢厂群众性机械化运动
    奖励先进生产者张明山等一百多人
    【本报讯】国营鞍山钢铁公司，在一月三十日举行推广小型轧钢厂群众性机械化运动及奖励大会，推广该公司小型轧钢厂群众性机械化运动的先进经验，并奖励在群众性机械化运动中有创造成绩的先进生产者张明山等一百多人。中华全国总工会、中国五金冶炼工会全国委员会和东北总工会等分别致电或写信向大会祝贺。中央人民政府重工业部和鞍山市人民政府等分别赠旗奖励小型轧钢厂。会上，中共鞍山市委员会书记韩天石等先后讲话，号召各厂矿向小型轧钢厂学习，推广这一群众性机械化运动。鞍山市特等劳动模范、轧钢机反围盘创造者张明山，代表小型轧钢厂全体工人在会上表示，他们决心争取在半年内使全厂的生产过程完全达到机械化和自动化。
    国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂开展的群众性机械化运动，是充分发动工人群众和技术人员有系统地改造旧的轧钢工厂的成功的经验。国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂是一个旧式的轧钢厂，过去大部分的生产过程都是用人力操作，生产效率很低。工人们必须在一千二百多度高温下进行工作，不但感到极度劳累，而且经常发生事故。解放以来，小型轧钢厂虽然在设备方面和福利方面有了很大的改进，但仍然有一百零二名工人在操作过程中被烫伤、轧伤、并患腰痛、腿痛等职业病。老工人张明山，在小型轧钢厂工作了二十来年，深知轧钢工人在工作中的危险和痛苦。解放后，在党的教育下，张明山的积极性大为提高，决心要设法改变这种恶劣的生产状况。经过三年多的苦心研究，在苏联专家的帮助下，他终于在一九五二年九月十四日试制轧钢机反围盘成功。张明山的这一创造，不但节省了百分之七十的劳动力，使钢材的产量和质量大大提高，并为小型轧钢厂生产过程全部机械化开辟了道路。张明山创造反围盘成功后，小型轧钢厂成立了自动化工作小组，深入车间，发动工人提机械化和自动化的建议，并组织多工种的技术小组，发动工人解决各种技术上的困难。全厂从厂长到工人都参加了这一机械化自动化的运动。运动中，新的创造发明不断涌现。先进电气工人孙世平创造了自动拨铁机，加热工人卢乃滔和技术员吴良亚等创造了加热炉推钢机，张祝山改进了立围盘，电焊工人韩长信和技术员苗志明创造了毛轧翻钢机等。今年一月二十九日，该厂第二车间工人又创造了毛轧机滑下板和立围盘。总计从一九五二年一月到九月，国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂的职工共创造了十五件生产机械化的机械设备，改进了二十三件机械设备。通过这一群众性机械化运动，该厂的几个主要工序，如加热炉、毛轧、光轧、剪断等，都已完全机械化。仅就其中的一项计算，一年就可以为国家创造七百四十二亿元的财富。今年该厂一月份的生产任务已提前两天完成。
