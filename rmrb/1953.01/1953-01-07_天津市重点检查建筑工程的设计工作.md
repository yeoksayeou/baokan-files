    Tianjin: The Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau's affiliated Construction Design Company began a focused inspection of past design work in late December. The goal is to summarize the problems and experiences of past design work to prepare for this year's capital construction design.
    The main content of this inspection by the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau's affiliated Construction Design Company is to investigate whether the viewpoint of serving production and serving the working people was clear in the past design of projects and whether the designs complied with the principles of practicality, solidity, economy, and aesthetics. Through this inspection, the aim is to analyze the principal problems and ideological roots existing in the design from general technical issues, thereby affirming experiences, criticizing shortcomings, improving the ideological level of designers, and finding some reference materials and formulating a set of relatively scientific design specifications to improve future design work.
    The company selected eight larger projects as the focus of the inspection, including the local state-owned Industrial Bureau's Model Machine Factory, the Grain Company's Ziya River Flour Mill, the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School, and the First Hospital of the North China Textile Administration Bureau. Engineers, technicians, and technical staff participated in the inspection work. The inspection method involved soliciting opinions from owners and users, as well as conducting on-site and "illustrated" inspections. A detailed inspection outline was also prepared before the inspection.
    After several days of inspection, more than 1,000 technical problems in the designs were identified. Preliminary synthesis and analysis revealed that the design work of the eight key projects generally suffered from a lack of in-depth investigation and research, construction being carried out without precise drilling and surveying, and an unclear viewpoint of serving production and serving workers. For example, the Tianjin Second Workers' Cultural Palace, due to the lack of scientific and thorough drilling and surveying during the design stage, discovered after construction that the ground was two meters deep with wells, mud pits, and coffins, making the foundation extremely unstable. Furthermore, the flour building of the Grain Company's Ziya River Flour Mill was originally intended to install sixteen machines, but due to inadequate design, only eight machines could be installed, which affected the factory's production.
    Currently, the inspection work of the company's eight key focus areas has been completed and is now entering the analysis and summary phase. Some technical personnel have also begun to ideologically criticize past incorrect design viewpoints and attitudes.

    天津市重点检查建筑工程的设计工作
    【本报讯】天津市建筑工程局所属建筑设计公司，于去年十二月下旬开始重点检查过去的设计工作，总结过去设计工作中的问题及经验，以便做好今年基本建设设计方面的准备工作。
    天津市建筑工程局所属建筑设计公司这次检查的主要内容，是调查研究过去设计的工程中为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的观点是否明确，是否符合实际需用、坚固、经济、美观的设计原则。通过这次检查，要求从一般的技术问题中分析出设计中存在的原则问题及思想根源，从而肯定经验，批判缺点，提高设计人员思想水平，并找出一些参考资料及制订一套比较科学的设计规格，以改进今后的设计工作。
    该公司这次选择了包括地方国营工业局示范机器厂、粮食公司子牙河面粉厂、工农速成中学、华北纺织管理局第一医院等八个较大工程作为检查的重点。参加检查工作的有工程师、技师、技术员等。检查方法是向业主及用户征求意见，并做现场及“图说”的检查。检查前还拟出了详细的检查提纲。
    经过几天的检查，共查出设计的技术问题一千余件。经过初步综合、分析，发现在八个重点工程的设计工作中，普遍存在着缺乏深入的调查研究、未进行精确钻探及勘测即行施工的现象，以及为生产服务、为工人服务观点不明确等问题。如天津市第二工人文化宫由于在设计时没有进行科学的、周密的钻探及勘测，在施工后发现地下两公尺就是水井、泥坑及棺材等，地基极不坚固。又如粮食公司子牙河面粉厂的粉楼，原来打算安装十六部机器，因为设计不周密，只能安装八部机器，使该厂的生产受到了影响。
    目前，该公司八个检查重点的检查工作已告完毕，正进入分析、总结的阶段。部分技术人员也开始从思想上批判了过去不正确的设计观点和态度。
