Editor's note: The People's Government of Bachu County, Xinjiang Province, the Democratic Women's Federation, cooperatives, the Public Security Bureau, the Health Center, the First Elementary School, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce wrote letters to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the leaders of the Central People's Government during the National Day celebration last year to express their respect. Although the letters, written in Uyghur, were received relatively late, we are publishing translations of two of them below because they come from the far western frontier of the motherland, far from Beijing, and reflect the love of the people of ethnic minorities in the border regions for the motherland.

    Respected and wise great leader Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and esteemed leaders of the Central People's Government: As the people of the whole country celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled enthusiasm and joy, we, on behalf of all the people of Bachu County, extend our heartfelt respect to you.
    Our country is one of the greatest countries in the world, with a large population, abundant resources, and is beautiful and lovable. However, in the past, under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the country was poor and the people lived a life of suffering.
    The sun of the East, the savior of the Chinese people, the respected and wise leader—Mao Zedong, for the freedom and bright and splendid life of the people, led the Chinese working people, unafraid of any difficulties and hardships, in a long struggle. In this way, the Chinese people can live a happy and joyful life. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China three years ago, under the leadership of the respected leader and the Chinese Communist Party, we, the people of Bachu County, have established our own government, carried out great social reform movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, rent reduction and anti-despotism, and the "Three-Anti" campaign. Now we have begun the great land reform movement, fundamentally overthrowing the feudal forces that have lasted for thousands of years, liberating agricultural productivity, and paving the way for the industrialization of the motherland.
    Chairman Mao, we will always miss you and wish you good health forever with heartfelt respect!
     　Bachu County People's Government

    Respected and wise great leader Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, esteemed leaders of the Central People's Government, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army:
    Today is the third anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China. All ethnic groups of China and the working people of the world are welcoming and celebrating this great day with boundless enthusiasm. We, the people of Bachu County, held a grand mass meeting. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the motherland has achieved vigorous development in all aspects. After the production movement and various great social reform movements, the local order in Bachu County, Xinjiang, has been stabilized, and the people's lives have been greatly improved. We know that the reason why we can enjoy a happy and joyful life today is because Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and you, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, fought heroically, drove the forces of imperialist aggression out of China, destroyed the reactionary rule of bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism in China, eliminated bandits and secret agents, and also helped our people of all ethnic groups create brilliant achievements on the production front. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the future of the Chinese people is bright and promising. On this great day, we assure you that we will, on the basis of past great achievements, work even harder to complete the great land reform movement that is underway, and actively complete our work tasks in various positions, closely unite around Chairman Mao, and strive for a better future! Finally, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to you!　Democratic Women's Federation of Bachu County, Xinjiang Province

    编者按：新疆省巴楚县人民政府、民主妇女联合会、合作社、公安局、卫生所、第一小学校和工商联合会各机关团体，在去年国庆节写信向毛主席、朱总司令和中央人民政府各位首长致敬。来信是用维吾尔文写的；虽然收到较迟，但因来自远离北京的祖国极西陲，反映了边疆地区少数民族人民对祖国的热爱，特译出两封发表于后。
    敬爱的英明伟大的领袖毛主席、朱德总司令和中央人民政府各位首长：在全国人民以无比热烈愉快的心情来欢庆中华人民共和国成立三周年的时候，我们代表巴楚县全体人民向您们致衷心的敬意。
    我们的国家是世界上最伟大的国家之一，人口众多，物产丰富，美丽可爱。但过去在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治下，国家贫困，人民过着痛苦的生活。
    东方的太阳，中国人民的救星，敬爱的、英明的领袖——毛泽东，为了人民的自由和光辉灿烂的生活，领导着中国的劳动人民，不怕任何艰难困苦，作了长期的斗争。这样，中国人民才能过着幸福愉快的生活。中华人民共和国成立三年来，我们巴楚县人民在敬爱的领袖和中国共产党领导下，建立了自己的政权，进行了镇压反革命、减租反霸、“三反”等伟大的社会改革运动，现在并已开始了伟大的土地改革运动，从根本上推翻延续数千年的封建势力，解放农业生产力并为祖国工业化开辟道路。
    毛主席，我们永远怀念您，并以衷心的敬意祝您身体永远健康！
     　巴楚县人民政府
    敬爱的英明伟大的领袖毛主席、朱总司令、中央人民政府各位首长并转人民解放军全体指战员：
    今天是我们中华人民共和国成立三周年纪念日，全中国各族人民以及全世界的劳动人民都以无限的热情来迎接和庆祝这个伟大的日子。我们巴楚县人民举行了隆重的群众大会。在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导下，祖国各方面都有了蓬勃的发展。我们新疆巴楚县经过生产运动和各种伟大的社会改革运动以后，地方秩序已经安定，人民生活大大改善。我们知道，我们今天所以能够得到幸福快乐的生活，是因为毛主席、朱总司令和您们领导的人民解放军全体指战员英勇战斗，把帝国主义的侵略势力赶出中国去，摧毁了官僚资本主义和封建主义在中国的反动统治，肃清了土匪、特务，并且还在生产战线上帮助我们各族人民创造了辉煌的成绩。在毛主席的领导下，中国人民的前途是光明远大的。在今天这个伟大的日子，我们向您们保证：一定在过去伟大成就的基础上，更加努力地来完成正在进行着的伟大的土地改革运动，并在各种不同的岗位上积极完成自己的工作任务，紧密地团结在毛主席的周围，为争取更加美好的将来奋斗！最后谨向您们致衷心的祝贺！　新疆省巴楚县民主妇女联合会
