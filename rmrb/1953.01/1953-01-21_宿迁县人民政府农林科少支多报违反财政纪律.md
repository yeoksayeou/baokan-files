    Suqian County People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Section Underreports Expenditures and Overreports Reimbursements, Violating Financial Discipline

    To the Editor: The Agricultural and Forestry Section of the Suqian County People's Government, Jiangsu Province, convened a cooperation and mutual aid conference in late September of last year. After the meeting, when compiling the final accounts, the section reported a reimbursement of 26 million yuan (RMB) to the Finance and Grain Section under the pretext of an overdraft on food expenses. The auditing comrade of the Finance and Grain Section discovered that there were no original vouchers in the receipt book and asked the Agricultural and Forestry Section for them. However, Comrade Zhang Mingxian, who handled the matter, said that the original vouchers had been given to a leading comrade by Comrade Yuan Qiyou and had been lost and could not be found. The auditing comrade formally pointed out to the leaders of the Agricultural and Forestry Section that without the original vouchers, the reimbursement procedures were incomplete and could not be reimbursed. At this point, Comrade Yuan Qiyou produced the original vouchers. The audit revealed that the actual expenditure vouchers totaled 22 million yuan (RMB), and more than 4 million yuan had been overreported. According to Comrade Yuan Qiyou, this amount was intended to purchase a batch of folding mats, tables, basins and other utensils.

    It is clear that the practice of underreporting expenditures and overreporting reimbursements by the Agricultural and Forestry Section demonstrates a complete lack of overall perspective and a serious violation of financial discipline. Such behavior is unacceptable, especially after the "Three-Anti" movement. It should also be pointed out that Comrade Yuan Qiyou is a financial inspector of Suqian County. He not only failed to stop this illegal behavior by the Agricultural and Forestry Section, nor did he report it to the leading authorities, but instead covered it up. This is extremely inappropriate. I suggest that the leadership of the Suqian County People's Government criticize the Agricultural and Forestry Section and Comrade Yuan Qiyou, urge them to make profound and public self-criticisms, and ensure that they correct this erroneous behavior in future work.
                                                                                                            Su Ren

### 宿迁县人民政府农林科少支多报违反财政纪律

    宿迁县人民政府农林科少支多报违反财政纪律
    编辑同志：江苏省宿迁县人民政府农林科在去年九月下旬召开合作互助会议。会议结束后，该科编报决算时以伙食费透支为名，向财粮科报销人民币二千六百余万元。财粮科审计同志发现单据簿内没有原始凭证，就向农林科索取。而经办人张名贤同志说：原始单据由袁启友同志交给一位领导同志，已被遗失无法寻找。审计同志又向农林科领导方面正式提出：没有原始凭证是不合报销手续的，不能报销。这时袁启友同志才将原始凭据拿出来。经审查结果，实际支出凭证计人民币二千二百余万元，多报销了四百多万元。据袁启友同志谈：此款是准备购买一批折席、桌、盆等用具的。
    很明显，农林科这种少支多报的做法是完全缺乏整体观念并严重违反财政纪律的。这种行为发生在“三反”运动以后更是不能允许的。还应该提出：袁启友同志是宿迁县的财政监察员。他对农林科这种违法行为不但不加制止，也不向领导机关反映，反而代为掩护。这是极不应该的。我建议宿迁县人民政府领导方面对农林科和袁启友同志提出批评，督促他们公开作深刻检讨，并在今后工作中切实纠正这种错误行为。　苏人
