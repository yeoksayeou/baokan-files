Since September 1952, the first-level organs in the Southwest Region and various organs in Chongqing City have successively established 108 spare-time political schools, accommodating a total of 80,739 cadres participating in the first and second levels of study. The spare-time political schools have hired 520 part-time theory teachers, equipped with 1,957 part-time or full-time study tutors, and assigned a considerable number of part-time or full-time cadres to the teaching affairs office of the spare-time schools. This has enabled the political theory study of in-service cadres to proceed systematically according to a certain plan, changing the past phenomenon of lacking systematic content and a sound organizational system.

In early 1951, a spare-time political school was established within the Southwest Industry Department, establishing various systems and improving teaching work, so that the political theory study of cadres working in the organs could proceed normally. In August 1952, the Southwest First-Level Organs Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department studied their experience and selected the spare-time political schools jointly established by the Municipal Finance Bureau, Personnel Bureau, and Labor Bureau for key experiments. In the key trials, three basic experiences were initially obtained: First, the advantage of adopting the form of a spare-time political school to organize the political theory study of in-service cadres is that each organ has a special institution, under the leadership of the Party committee, to specifically manage cadre study. Because the spare-time political school has necessary and relatively formal study organizations and systems, each unit of study can be organized and led through steps such as previewing, attending class, reviewing, classroom discussion, answering questions, and summarizing, thus consolidating and expanding the learning effect. Second, establishing a sound and effective teaching affairs office is an important link in running a good spare-time political school, because this institution is the hub for helping teachers teach and guiding students to learn well. For this reason, it is necessary to equip cadres with considerable theoretical level and teaching experience to serve as directors of teaching affairs, and at the same time, a certain number of full-time cadres must be assigned under the teaching affairs office to become capable assistants to the director of teaching affairs. Third, the attention and support of the Party committee and administrative leadership of this organ is extremely important. If the responsible comrades can personally undertake the necessary school work or teaching, ensure study time and systems, make up their minds to allocate a certain number of cadres to manage study, and provide regular guidance to their work, then the school can be established and run well.

Last September, the Southwest First-Level Organs Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee made separate decisions, stipulating that "organizing the political theory study of in-service cadres is the central task of the organ's Party branch"; "senior cadres are responsible for lecturing to general cadres at the second and third levels, and general cadres at the third level are responsible for lecturing to the first level," etc. Each unit carried out preparatory work for establishing schools based on this decision and the experience of key trials. Some units, such as the Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China, also held short-term training courses for study tutors. On October 6th last year, the first-level organs in the Southwest and various organs in Chongqing City uniformly held opening ceremonies for political schools, and Comrades He Long, Song Renqiong, Zhang Jichun, and Zhang Ziyi made important instructions.

The first-level spare-time political schools are mostly organized separately by each unit, with branches set up in units with too many people; units with too few people are merged to form one school. The learning content is "Political Common Sense Reader." The school teachers are all concurrently held by responsible comrades of each unit. The second level studies "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" and selected readings from Chairman Mao's works. Because the number of people is smaller and teachers are not as easy to resolve as the first level, the method of several units jointly establishing schools (such as the Southwest Military and Political Committee establishing seven second-level spare-time political schools) or joint classes (such as Chongqing City dividing all schools into two major academic districts for classes) is adopted, and the principals and teachers are also concurrently held by responsible comrades of each unit.

In addition, two lecturer groups were established as the core for guiding and promoting cadre study. The first-level lecturer group in the Southwest was composed of 19 comrades, including Song Renqiong, deputy secretary of the Southwest Bureau, and Zhang Ziyi, minister of propaganda, responsible for lecturing to senior cadres in the city and general cadres participating in the third level of study. The Chongqing Municipal Lecturer Group was composed of 26 comrades, including Cao Diqiu, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Ren Baige, minister of propaganda, responsible for lecturing to the city's general cadres at the second level, and for preparing lessons for the theory teachers of the first-level spare-time political schools and the study tutors of the first and second levels.

After the spare-time political schools were organized, a new atmosphere appeared in the entire cadre political theory study. The cadres participating in the study are in high spirits. In the past, it was believed that the mobility of work was very high, and the units that were most difficult to persist in learning have now undergone great changes. For example, among the twelve cadres participating in theory study in the Wangyeshibao police station in the first district of the Public Security Bureau, 100% took self-study notes in the past month, and more than two-thirds of them sorted out the notes after listening to the lectures; the district and township cadres in the third district of Ba County not only organized regular theory study, but also persisted in a system of six hours of study per week. However, to maintain and consolidate this enthusiasm for learning on a regular basis, it is necessary to strengthen the guidance of learning, improve the quality of teaching, and gradually improve their thinking in the process of learning to improve their work. In spare-time political schools, the combination of class, discussion, and self-study is combined, and the key link is to give good lectures. According to the four-month work experience of the spare-time political schools in various organs, these three problems must be solved well.

First, the lecture problem. Because all the theory teachers are part-time administrative comrades from various units, they are all very busy, and some of them have a lower theoretical level. Therefore, only a few lectures can satisfy the students. According to the experience of some spare-time political schools with better teaching results, overcoming the above-mentioned difficulties should be approached from two aspects: (1) Teachers should be fully prepared. As long as teachers attach importance to lecturing and improve their work methods, it is possible to be fully prepared. For example, Xin Yizhi, Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, strives to take two afternoons to prepare for each lecture. In addition to carefully preparing the course himself, he also takes time to find comrades with a higher theoretical level to jointly study the central content of the course, revise his lecture outline, and find students of various levels to understand the difficult problems in learning and their requirements, so the lecture effect is better. (2) The teaching affairs office of the spare-time school should take helping teachers prepare lessons as the center of regular work. Do your best to collect relevant reference books for teachers, draw up lecture outlines for teachers' reference, and have a deeper understanding of the students' ideological situation and existing difficult problems, conduct intensive research and provide them to teachers for reference, or assist teachers in holding investigation meetings to understand the situation. The Southwest Military and Political Committee and Chongqing City also invited some comrades from the lecturer group to give preparatory lessons to theory teachers, which also greatly helped improve the lecturing level of theory teachers.

Second, the classroom discussion problem. Because the vast majority of study tutors have not received professional training and have poor theoretical levels, the classroom discussions in many schools have actually formed casual small-group discussions, and have not achieved the desired results. The fundamental way to solve this difficulty is to gradually cultivate and improve the working ability of study tutors. Some schools have established guidance groups under the teaching affairs office, regularly convene tutor meetings, and allow tutors to learn one step ahead. Before holding classroom discussions, convene tutors to study how to come up with discussion topics, how to answer these topics, and introduce reference materials to each other (some schools have also held demonstrative classroom discussions by theory teachers themselves, so that they can gain experience). At the same time, before conducting classroom discussions, the tutor checks the students' speech outlines and studies possible problems in the discussion, so that he has a good idea in his mind in order to prepare in advance. These methods are helpful for improving the tutor's ability to lead classroom discussions. For this reason, administrative leaders must appropriately reduce the administrative work of part-time study tutors, so that they have time to prepare.

Third, the self-study problem. In general cadres, past learning is generally accustomed to listening to lectures and chatting casually, and not accustomed to looking carefully and thinking more. Therefore, in addition to trying to give good lectures and doing a good job in classroom discussions, it is also necessary to promote serious reading, especially first carefully studying the text of the course, so that the comrades who study can truly gain something.

At present, the spare-time political schools for in-service cadres in the first-level organs in the Southwest and Chongqing City have been opened universally, and the students are also very enthusiastic about learning. However, because we were not prepared enough for teaching power when the school started (such as not training theory teachers, and the training of study tutors was also very little) and the cadre strength of the education departments of various units is weak, the guiding force cannot keep up with the needs of the work. We are starting to study and improve from this aspect.
