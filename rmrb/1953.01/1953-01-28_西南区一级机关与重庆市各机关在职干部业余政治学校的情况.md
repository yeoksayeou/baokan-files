The Theory and Education Section of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

Since September 1952, the first-level organs in the Southwest Region and various organs in Chongqing City have successively established 108 spare-time political schools, accommodating a total of 80,739 cadres participating in the first and second levels of study. The spare-time political schools have hired 520 part-time theory teachers, equipped with 1,957 part-time or full-time study tutors, and assigned a considerable number of part-time or full-time cadres to the teaching affairs office of the spare-time schools. This has enabled the political theory study of in-service cadres to proceed systematically according to a certain plan, changing the past phenomenon of lacking systematic content and a sound organizational system.

In early 1951, a spare-time political school was established within the Southwest Industry Department, establishing various systems and improving teaching work, so that the political theory study of cadres working in the organs could proceed normally. In August 1952, the Southwest First-Level Organs Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department studied their experience and selected the spare-time political schools jointly established by the Municipal Finance Bureau, Personnel Bureau, and Labor Bureau for key experiments. In the key trials, three basic experiences were initially obtained: First, the advantage of adopting the form of a spare-time political school to organize the political theory study of in-service cadres is that each organ has a special institution, under the leadership of the Party committee, to specifically manage cadre study. Because the spare-time political school has necessary and relatively formal study organizations and systems, each unit of study can be organized and led through steps such as previewing, attending class, reviewing, classroom discussion, answering questions, and summarizing, thus consolidating and expanding the learning effect. Second, establishing a sound and effective teaching affairs office is an important link in running a good spare-time political school, because this institution is the hub for helping teachers teach and guiding students to learn well. For this reason, it is necessary to equip cadres with considerable theoretical level and teaching experience to serve as directors of teaching affairs, and at the same time, a certain number of full-time cadres must be assigned under the teaching affairs office to become capable assistants to the director of teaching affairs. Third, the attention and support of the Party committee and administrative leadership of this organ is extremely important. If the responsible comrades can personally undertake the necessary school work or teaching, ensure study time and systems, make up their minds to allocate a certain number of cadres to manage study, and provide regular guidance to their work, then the school can be established and run well.

Last September, the Southwest First-Level Organs Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee made separate decisions, stipulating that "organizing the political theory study of in-service cadres is the central task of the organ's Party branch"; "senior cadres are responsible for lecturing to general cadres at the second and third levels, and general cadres at the third level are responsible for lecturing to the first level," etc. Each unit carried out preparatory work for establishing schools based on this decision and the experience of key trials. Some units, such as the Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China, also held short-term training courses for study tutors. On October 6th last year, the first-level organs in the Southwest and various organs in Chongqing City uniformly held opening ceremonies for political schools, and Comrades He Long, Song Renqiong, Zhang Jichun, and Zhang Ziyi made important instructions.

The first-level spare-time political schools are mostly organized separately by each unit, with branches set up in units with too many people; units with too few people are merged to form one school. The learning content is "Political Common Sense Reader." The school teachers are all concurrently held by responsible comrades of each unit. The second level studies "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" and selected readings from Chairman Mao's works. Because the number of people is smaller and teachers are not as easy to resolve as the first level, the method of several units jointly establishing schools (such as the Southwest Military and Political Committee establishing seven second-level spare-time political schools) or joint classes (such as Chongqing City dividing all schools into two major academic districts for classes) is adopted, and the principals and teachers are also concurrently held by responsible comrades of each unit.

In addition, two lecturer groups were established as the core for guiding and promoting cadre study. The first-level lecturer group in the Southwest was composed of 19 comrades, including Song Renqiong, deputy secretary of the Southwest Bureau, and Zhang Ziyi, minister of propaganda, responsible for lecturing to senior cadres in the city and general cadres participating in the third level of study. The Chongqing Municipal Lecturer Group was composed of 26 comrades, including Cao Diqiu, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Ren Baige, minister of propaganda, responsible for lecturing to the city's general cadres at the second level, and for preparing lessons for the theory teachers of the first-level spare-time political schools and the study tutors of the first and second levels.

After the spare-time political schools were organized, a new atmosphere appeared in the entire cadre political theory study. The cadres participating in the study are in high spirits. In the past, it was believed that the mobility of work was very high, and the units that were most difficult to persist in learning have now undergone great changes. For example, among the twelve cadres participating in theory study in the Wangyeshibao police station in the first district of the Public Security Bureau, 100% took self-study notes in the past month, and more than two-thirds of them sorted out the notes after listening to the lectures; the district and township cadres in the third district of Ba County not only organized regular theory study, but also persisted in a system of six hours of study per week. However, to maintain and consolidate this enthusiasm for learning on a regular basis, it is necessary to strengthen the guidance of learning, improve the quality of teaching, and gradually improve their thinking in the process of learning to improve their work. In spare-time political schools, the combination of class, discussion, and self-study is combined, and the key link is to give good lectures. According to the four-month work experience of the spare-time political schools in various organs, these three problems must be solved well.

First, the lecture problem. Because all the theory teachers are part-time administrative comrades from various units, they are all very busy, and some of them have a lower theoretical level. Therefore, only a few lectures can satisfy the students. According to the experience of some spare-time political schools with better teaching results, overcoming the above-mentioned difficulties should be approached from two aspects: (1) Teachers should be fully prepared. As long as teachers attach importance to lecturing and improve their work methods, it is possible to be fully prepared. For example, Xin Yizhi, Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, strives to take two afternoons to prepare for each lecture. In addition to carefully preparing the course himself, he also takes time to find comrades with a higher theoretical level to jointly study the central content of the course, revise his lecture outline, and find students of various levels to understand the difficult problems in learning and their requirements, so the lecture effect is better. (2) The teaching affairs office of the spare-time school should take helping teachers prepare lessons as the center of regular work. Do your best to collect relevant reference books for teachers, draw up lecture outlines for teachers' reference, and have a deeper understanding of the students' ideological situation and existing difficult problems, conduct intensive research and provide them to teachers for reference, or assist teachers in holding investigation meetings to understand the situation. The Southwest Military and Political Committee and Chongqing City also invited some comrades from the lecturer group to give preparatory lessons to theory teachers, which also greatly helped improve the lecturing level of theory teachers.

Second, the classroom discussion problem. Because the vast majority of study tutors have not received professional training and have poor theoretical levels, the classroom discussions in many schools have actually formed casual small-group discussions, and have not achieved the desired results. The fundamental way to solve this difficulty is to gradually cultivate and improve the working ability of study tutors. Some schools have established guidance groups under the teaching affairs office, regularly convene tutor meetings, and allow tutors to learn one step ahead. Before holding classroom discussions, convene tutors to study how to come up with discussion topics, how to answer these topics, and introduce reference materials to each other (some schools have also held demonstrative classroom discussions by theory teachers themselves, so that they can gain experience). At the same time, before conducting classroom discussions, the tutor checks the students' speech outlines and studies possible problems in the discussion, so that he has a good idea in his mind in order to prepare in advance. These methods are helpful for improving the tutor's ability to lead classroom discussions. For this reason, administrative leaders must appropriately reduce the administrative work of part-time study tutors, so that they have time to prepare.

Third, the self-study problem. In general cadres, past learning is generally accustomed to listening to lectures and chatting casually, and not accustomed to looking carefully and thinking more. Therefore, in addition to trying to give good lectures and doing a good job in classroom discussions, it is also necessary to promote serious reading, especially first carefully studying the text of the course, so that the comrades who study can truly gain something.

At present, the spare-time political schools for in-service cadres in the first-level organs in the Southwest and Chongqing City have been opened universally, and the students are also very enthusiastic about learning. However, because we were not prepared enough for teaching power when the school started (such as not training theory teachers, and the training of study tutors was also very little) and the cadre strength of the education departments of various units is weak, the guiding force cannot keep up with the needs of the work. We are starting to study and improve from this aspect.

    西南区一级机关与重庆市各机关在职干部业余政治学校的情况
    中共中央西南局宣传部理论教育处
    西南区一级机关及重庆市各机关，自一九五二年九月以来，先后设立了一百零八所业余政治学校，容纳了全部参加第一、二两级学习的干部八万零七百三十九人。各业余政治学校聘请了五百二十位兼职理论教员，配备了一千九百五十七位兼职的或专职的学习辅导员，并在业余学校教务处下配备相当数量的兼职或专职的干部。这样就使得在职干部的政治理论学习能按照一定的计划循序渐进，改变了过去缺乏系统的内容、缺乏较好的组织制度的现象。
    一九五一年初，西南工业部机关内成立了业余政治学校，建立了各种制度，改进了教学工作，使机关工作干部的政治理论学习得以正常地进行。一九五二年八月间，西南一级机关党委和重庆市委宣传部研究了他们的经验，并分别选定市府财政局、人事局、劳动局等单位联合成立的业余政治学校进行重点实验，在重点试办中，初步取得三个基本经验：第一，采取业余政治学校的形式、组织在职干部政治理论学习的优点是：使各机关均有专门的机构，在党委领导下，具体管理干部学习。由于业余政治学校有必要的、比较正规的学习组织与制度，使每个单元的学习，均能按预习、上课、复习、课堂讨论、解答问题及总结等步骤，有组织有领导地进行，因而可以巩固和扩大学习效果。第二，建立一个健全有力的教务处是办好业余政治学校的一个重要环节，因为这一机构是帮助教员教学，指导学员学好的枢纽，为此就须要配备有相当理论水平和教学经验的干部充当教务主任，同时在教务处下面还须配备一定数量的专职干部，使之成为教务主任的得力助手。第三，本机关的党委与行政领导上的重视与支持是极端重要的。如果负责同志能亲自担任必要的学校工作或教员，保证学习时间和制度，下决心配备一定数量的管理学习的干部，并对他们的工作经常予以指导，则学校是可以成立起来并办好的。
    去年九月，西南一级机关党委与重庆市委分别作出了决定，规定“组织在职干部的政治理论学习为机关党支部的中心任务”；“高级干部均有为一般干部第二、三两级讲课之责，一般干部第三级均有为第一级讲课之责”等。各单位根据这一决定和重点试办的经验，分别进行了创校筹备工作，有些单位如中国人民银行重庆分行还举办了学习辅导员的短期训练班。去年十月六日西南一级机关及重庆市各机关政治学校统一举行开学典礼，贺龙、宋任穷、张际春、张子意等同志均作了重要指示。
    第一级的业余政治学校，多系由各单位分别组成，人数过多的单位下设分校；人数过少的单位，合并成立一个学校。学习内容为“政治常识读本”。学校教员皆由各单位负责同志兼任。第二级学习“中国共产党的三十年”并选读毛主席著作，因人数较少，教员又不如第一级容易解决，故采取几个单位联合成立学校（如西南军政委员会所有单位共成立七个第二级业余政治学校）或联合上课（如重庆市把所有学校分成两大学区上课），校长、教员亦系各单位负责同志兼任。
    此外，还成立了两个讲师团，作为指导和推动干部学习的核心。西南一级的讲师团由西南局副书记宋任穷、宣传部长张子意等十九位同志组成，负责给全市高级干部和参加第三级学习的一般干部讲课。重庆市讲师团由市委书记曹荻秋、宣传部长任白戈等二十六位同志组成，除为市的一般干部第二级讲课外，并负责为第一级业余政治学校的理论教员和第一、二两级学习辅导员备课。
    业余政治学校组织起来后，整个干部政治理论学习出现了新的气象。参加学习的干部情绪很高，过去认为工作流动性很大，最难坚持学习的单位，现在也有了很大改变，如公安局一区王爷石堡派出所十二个参加理论学习的干部中，一个月来记自修笔记的占百分之百，听课后把笔记整理出来的占三分之二强；巴县第三区的区乡干部不但组织起来进行经常的理论学习，而且每周坚持了学习六小时的制度。但要使这种学习积极性经常保持和巩固，就必须加强学习指导力量，提高教学质量，使他们在学习过程中能逐步提高思想，以改进工作。在业余政治学校中，上课、讨论与自修三者是相结合的，而其中又以讲好课为中心环节。根据各机关业余政治学校四个月来的工作经验，这三个问题必须很好的加以解决。
    第一，讲课问题。由于全部理论教员都是聘请各单位行政上较负责的同志兼任，他们工作都很忙，其中并有少数理论水平较低，因此，讲课能使学员满意的是少数。根据一些教员讲课效果较好的业余政治学校的经验，克服上述困难应从两方面着手：（一）教员应有充分准备，只要教员重视讲课工作、并改进工作方法，是可以做到有充分准备的，如重庆市委秘书长辛易之同志每讲一次课，总要争取两个下午的时间进行准备，他除了自己认真准备课程外，还抽时间找理论水平较高的同志共同研究课程中心内容，修改自己的讲授提纲，又找各种水平不同的学员来了解学习中存在的疑难问题与他们的要求，因而讲课效果较好。（二）业余学校教务处应把帮助教员备课作为经常工作的中心。尽力为教员搜集有关参考书籍，拟就讲授提纲供教员参考，并须较深入地了解学员的思想情况与存在的疑难问题，加以集中研究后提供教员参考，或协助教员开好了解情况的调查会。西南军政委员会及重庆市并请讲师团的某些同志专为理论教员上预备课，这对提高理论教员的讲课水平也有很大帮助。
    第二，课堂讨论问题。由于学习辅导员绝大部分未经专业训练，理论水平差，因而许多学校的课堂讨论实际上形成漫谈式的小组讨论，没有收到应有的效果。解决这一困难的根本办法，是逐步培养与提高学习辅导员的工作能力。某些学校在教务处下成立辅导组，定期的召集辅导员会议，并使辅导员先学一步，在举行课堂讨论之前，召集辅导员研究如何出讨论题目，应如何解答这些题目，并互相介绍参考材料（有些学校并曾由理论教员亲自召集辅导员进行示范性的课堂讨论，使之取得经验）。同时，在进行课堂讨论之前，由辅导员抽查学员的发言提纲，研究讨论中可能发生的问题，使自己心中有数，以便事先准备，这些办法对于提高辅导员领导课堂讨论的能力是有帮助的。为此，行政领导上必须适当减轻兼职学习辅导员的行政工作，使之有时间进行准备工作。
    第三，自修问题。在一般干部中过去学习一般是习惯于听讲与漫谈，而不习惯于细看与多想，因此，在尽力讲好课、作好课堂讨论之外，还须提倡认真读书，特别是首先认真研读课程的正文，这样才能使学习的同志真正有所收获。
    目前西南一级机关及重庆市在职干部业余政治学校是普遍开办起来了，学员学习情绪也很高，但由于开学时我们对教学力量的准备不够（如未训练理论教员，学习辅导员的训练也很少）和各单位教育部门的干部力量较弱，因此，指导力量还赶不上工作的需要。我们正从这方面着手研究改进中。
