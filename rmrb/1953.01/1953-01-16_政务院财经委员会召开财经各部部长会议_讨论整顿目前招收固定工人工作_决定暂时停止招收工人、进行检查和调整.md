    [This Newspaper's Report] The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council convened a meeting of ministers of financial and economic departments on the 13th to discuss reducing the construction plans of each department for this year and rectifying the current work of recruiting permanent workers. Comrade Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, presided over the meeting.

    After comparing the construction plans proposed by each department with the current construction capacity and material situation, Comrade Jia Tuofu pointed out that the construction plans of each department must be reduced due to insufficient construction capacity and materials. The principle of construction should be: factories first, warehouses second, and dormitories and offices last. Based on this principle, the Financial and Economic Committee reviewed the plans of each department and believed that about 30 percent should be cut from the total number of projects. He also read out the reduced construction quantities of each department at the meeting, asking each department to reconsider this year's construction plans accordingly.

    Next, the meeting discussed the rectification of the recruitment of permanent workers. Comrade Jia Tuofu pointed out that the current work of recruiting permanent workers has reached a considerable quantity due to everyone starting at the same time, but the situation is very chaotic due to the lack of a unified plan. On the one hand, there has been a phenomenon of snatching workers, and on the other hand, there is a lack of good investigation and overall planning regarding how many permanent workers are needed and what types of workers are needed. In order to rectify the current situation, the Financial and Economic Committee has decided to temporarily suspend the recruitment of workers from today, and then conduct inspections and adjustments. After inspection, if there are too many permanent workers, they will be transferred to each other; if there are not enough, recruitment will be carried out in a planned manner. In the future, the recruitment of workers should be handled in accordance with the methods of Beijing Municipality approved by the Government Administration Council. This method is: all units that need to recruit workers should recruit uniformly through local people's governments, labor bureaus, and trade unions, and it is absolutely forbidden to snatch workers from each other. The principle of adjusting permanent workers is first to check whether the existing number of permanent workers is too high or too low based on the amount of work. According to preliminary estimates, each square meter of steel structure construction project requires about ten man-days, reinforced concrete structure construction project requires about six man-days, mixed structure construction project requires about 4.8 man-days, and brick-wood structure construction project requires about four man-days. According to the calculations of the Northeast Civil Engineering and Building Engineering Company, an average of 300 to 350 man-days is required for every 10,000 square meters of construction. Each department can refer to these statistics for inspection. Secondly, it is necessary to adjust the permanent workers according to different types of work. According to the statistics of the Northeast Civil Engineering and Building Engineering Company, except for steel structure projects, the percentages of various types of workers required for the other three types of structure construction projects are as follows: carpenters and tilers account for about 35 percent, plumbers, cement workers, tinsmiths, and steel bar workers account for about 25 percent, and laborers account for 40 percent. Among them, laborers and some carpenters and tilers can be employed as temporary workers, so permanent workers should be limited to skilled workers or other types of workers as much as possible, totaling about 40 to 50 percent of the workers needed for construction. If it is a general brick-wood structure project, only about 30 percent of the workers need to be permanent. Other workers can be employed as fixed-term contract workers and temporary workers. Thirdly, there must be a backbone among the permanent workers, so that it is easy to lead learning and carry out management. The Northeast region has decided to transfer 4,000 to 5,000 Party members and League members from the countryside to participate in the construction worker team. This measure is very necessary. This experience in Northeast China can be used for reference in various regions.

    In addition, Comrade Jia Tuofu pointed out that the wage standards of construction workers must also be unified by region. The phenomenon of arbitrarily raising wages during the recruitment of workers has already occurred in Beijing Municipality. This bias must be checked and corrected. For this reason, the Financial and Economic Committee has decided to entrust the Central Construction Engineering Department, the Ministry of Labor, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to jointly study and propose a control standard. When training permanent workers, attention should also be paid to training construction site managers, and the number can be calculated according to the construction plan. Each department should also conduct an inspection and improvement of the safety issues in construction.

    At the meeting, exchanges were also conducted on issues such as planning and cadre training.

    政务院财经委员会召开财经各部部长会议
    讨论整顿目前招收固定工人工作
    决定暂时停止招收工人、进行检查和调整
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会十三日召开财经各部部长会议，讨论削减各部今年建筑计划，整顿目前招收固定工人的工作。会议由政务院财政经济委员会副主任贾拓夫同志主持。
    贾拓夫同志在将各部所提建筑计划和目前施工力量及材料情况作了比较后指出：由于施工力量和材料的不足，各部建筑计划必须缩减。建筑的原则，应该是厂房第一，仓库其次，宿舍和办公室再次之。根据这项原则，财政经济委员会审核各部计划的结果，认为应从计划总数中削减百分之三十左右。他并在会上宣读了核减后的各部建筑数量，请各部依此重新考虑今年建筑计划。
    接着，会议讨论了整顿招收固定工人工作的问题。贾拓夫同志指出：目前招收固定工人的工作，由于大家一齐下手，已经达到相当的数量，但因没有统一的计划，情况非常混乱。一方面发生了抢拉工人的现象，另一方面对于究竟需要固定多少工人、固定什么工种的工人，还缺乏很好的调查研究和通盘计划。为了整顿目前的情况，财政经济委员会决定即日起先暂时停止招收工人，然后进行检查和调整。经过检查，固定的工人如果多了，要互相调剂；如果不足，再有计划地进行招收。今后招收工人应按照经过政务院批准的北京市的办法办理。这个办法就是：所有需要招收工人的单位，应通过各地人民政府、劳动局和工会统一招收，绝对禁止互相拉夺。调整固定工人的原则，首先是根据工程数量，检查现有固定工人是多是少。根据初步估算，每平方公尺的钢铁结构建筑工程约需十个人工，钢筋混凝土结构建筑工程约需六个多人工，混合结构建筑工程约需四点八个人工，砖木结构工程约需四个人工。根据东北土木建筑工程公司的计算，平均每一万平方公尺的建筑，约需三百至三百五十个人工。各部可参考这些统计数字，进行检查。其次，必须根据不同工种，调整固定工人。根据东北土木建筑工程公司的统计，除去钢铁结构的工程而外，其它三种结构的建筑工程，综合起来，所需各工种工人的百分比如下：木瓦工人约百分之三十五，管道、洋灰、白铁、钢筋等类工人约百分之二十五，小工百分之四十。其中小工及部分木瓦工，都可采用临时工，因此固定工人应尽量限于技术工人或其它工种工人，总计约占建筑所需工人的百分之四十至五十左右。如系一般砖木结构工程，则只固定百分之三十左右的工人即可。其他工人，可以采用定期合同制工人和临时工人解决之。再次，固定工人中，必须要有骨干，这样才便于领导学习和进行管理。东北地区已决定从农村中抽调四千至五千名党员和团员参加建筑工人队伍，这一措施是十分必要的。东北地区的这一经验，可供各地参考。
    另外，贾拓夫同志指出：建筑工人的工资标准也必须按地区加以统一。北京市已发生在招收工人时任意提高工资的现象。这种偏向必须检查纠正。为此，财政经济委员会决定委托中央建筑工程部、劳动部和全国总工会共同研究，提出一个控制的标准。在训练固定工人时，也应注意训练工地管理人员，其数量可根据工程计划加以计算。对于施工中的安全问题，各部也应检查一次加以改进。
    会上，并对编制计划、培养干部等问题进行了交谈。
