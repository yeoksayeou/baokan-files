    The contrast between the old and the new can help us more deeply understand our current life.

    If the machine industry of old China, even in Shanghai, the most developed and outstanding city in the machine industry, was of a colonial nature, with most machine factories only able to do repair work for imported British and American machines, and at most only able to make small, ordinary machines, but not independently manufacture complete or complete sets of heavy machinery, then today, we must decisively change our tune when evaluating the machine industry of New China. A new heavy machinery plant, capable of systematically manufacturing heavy machinery to serve heavy industry, is being built in Taiyuan. The construction of this plant also lays the foundation for the establishment of more heavy machinery plants currently being planned.

    I visited this machine factory with an excited heart.

    I walked from the factory gate along a road, and after eight minutes, I arrived at the door of a small hardware warehouse. Diagonally opposite this "small house" (even this small house is larger than an ordinary auditorium) is the tall factory building. Here, forging, cold working, and primary processing workshops several meters high have already been built. This spring, as soon as the land thaws, a cast iron workshop of over 10,000 square meters capable of casting 75-ton components, and a metalworking assembly workshop of over 20,000 square meters, will continue to be built. Even last winter, workers (many of whom came from the Yangtze River basin) braved the fierce wind and snow, which they had never experienced in the South, and erected part of the steel frame for the steel casting workshop on more than 10,000 square meters of land. This steel structure, over 30 meters high, is painted in bright red, which contrasts beautifully with the snow-covered mountains and the earth. People are thinking that perhaps in less than a year, new open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces will be built in this field that was once connected by fields, and dozens of tons of steel parts will be continuously cast.

    With heavy-duty machine tools, we can talk about the manufacturing of heavy machinery such as smelting, chemical, and mining machinery equipment. Here, we can clearly see this possibility. Three years ago, when the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry held the first national machine industry conference, the representatives from various regions also considered the establishment of a heavy machinery plant as just a beautiful ideal. A considerable part of the machines ordered by the factory from abroad have not yet been delivered. Of those that have been delivered, most are smaller in terms of the total order. But for the general domestic machine factories, these are already large enough. In the primary processing workshop, I saw a planer with a gate width of six and a half meters. It is said that this is only considered a smaller one among the ordered but not yet delivered gantry planers. I also saw a five-meter vertical lathe, a behemoth weighing about 150 tons and occupying an area of 100 square meters. With such a large lathe, the factory building feels too small. Although the factory building is tall enough. This is a lathe that can be disassembled for transportation. Before this lathe was transported, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry had allocated two vertical lathes of the same size but only transportable as a whole to the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. Because the Zhengtai Railway tunnel was too small to transport, it had to be abandoned. Small tunnel, big machine, cannot be transported, this is the new problem we are facing today. However, isn't this a pleasant "difficulty" on the road to industrialization?

    An engineer comrade led me into a forging workshop. In this workshop, two five-ton steam hammers and a thousand-ton hydraulic press are being gradually installed. Looking at these devices, people can't help but feel a strong sense of power. Just how powerful are these things? Perhaps many people have been to ordinary machine factories and have personally seen the forging of steel by steam hammers. The sound of the steam hammer hitting can even hurt the eardrums. However, general steam hammers are only a quarter or half a ton. One ton or two tons can really be considered remarkable. However, here, that can only be considered a little brother. Here, an even larger forging workshop is being planned.

    After I had seen all the existing buildings, I repeatedly examined the projects that will be started this year according to the factory's general layout plan. I think the transportation network under construction in this factory is a great system. In the west of the factory is a dedicated station for this factory, with seven branch lines totaling about 20 kilometers connecting to various workshops. All raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products in various workshops are transported by trains, trams, and a small number of automobiles. Here, we can fully imagine that it is difficult for human hands to directly handle steel castings weighing dozens or hundreds of tons. And the semi-finished products from the steel casting, cast iron, forging, cold working, and primary processing workshops are summarized and sent to the metalworking assembly workshop by an outdoor overhead crane that is 700 meters long. This crane is like a mother with many children, picking up each child—the product of the workshop—and merging them into a large basket—the core metalworking assembly workshop. So that it is finally assembled into finished products one by one. The characteristics of this transportation network are: 1. Generally, manual handling is not used, but mechanical force is used instead of manpower. 2. The use of cranes to connect various workshops reduces the transportation lines of trains and trams, shortens the running time of semi-finished products, and reduces transportation costs. 3. The train and tram roads are below, and the cranes are in the air, so that the workshops will not interfere with each other when transporting semi-finished products to the metalworking assembly workshop.

    This is a factory built with the help and guidance of Soviet experts using advanced socialist technology and experience, and designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel. For the top-notch mechanical experts in the country, building such a heavy machinery plant is still a completely new topic. Many domestic mechanical experts have studied or interned in capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and Germany. However, what they can come into contact with is often only a small part of a factory, and there are very few or none who can see or become familiar with the entire factory. Engineer Su Zhijian, who is the director of the technical department of this factory, told me that he had interned in an Austrian munitions factory for six months, but the place where he interned was at most the size of the current hardware warehouse of this factory. In this way, in the face of the task of building my country's unprecedented heavy machinery plant, from design to construction, there are many difficulties that cannot be ignored. For example, how should such tall factory buildings be designed correctly, how many machines should be installed in each workshop, and how should economic rationality be achieved? None of these have been experienced before and are sure of success. In this way, we must use our brains. Therefore, in the autumn of 1950, hundreds of engineering and technical personnel gathered in Shanghai to conduct design in a collective discussion. Even if these preliminary designs have been changed more than ten or eight times later, we should admit that this is undoubtedly a bold and historically significant attempt in the Chinese engineering and technical community.

    For example, in the preliminary design, many people thought that the bigger the better; all machines should be the first- or second-class in the world, with a wide variety of products, all-encompassing; the remaining space between and within the factory buildings should be larger for expansion, but without carefully considering the economic rationality and technical advancement of a factory, so that it becomes a harmonious and rhythmic organism. Under the several enthusiastic and unforgettable assistance of Soviet experts, many errors and shortcomings caused by wrong ideas have been corrected. For example: the general layout of the factory was greatly changed, and the factory buildings that should not be so large were reduced; the distance between the factory buildings was reduced from the original 150 meters to 60 meters. This not only greatly reduced production costs, but also increased the utilization area of ​​the land. And the most important thing is that Soviet experts helped us establish the socialist economic accounting ideology. That is, the scale and product types of the factory should be determined based on the current technical conditions; the equipment of each workshop should be balanced with the quantity of products, so that they can fully exert their efficiency.

    In the past few years, the war-mongers such as Truman and Acheson, who resented New China, have shouted and threatened their vassal countries in every possible way to stop exporting so-called strategic materials to our country, in an attempt to economically suffocate our country. However, after we have seen the mechanical equipment of this factory with our own eyes, we can say this: your shameless conspiracy has been a complete failure. The working class of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe and the German Democratic Republic have given us selfless assistance. New, large-scale machines of various types are constantly being shipped in. And the advantages of these machines are far beyond the reach of machines manufactured by some capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain. The machines from these countries have a common feature: the machines are precise; the structure is reasonable; the electrical operation departments are concentrated, and the use is safe; the production efficiency is high. I have visited a Soviet-made radial drilling machine. The designer of that lathe can be said to have thought of everything for the safety of the workers. When the worker using it, due to a moment of negligence, forgets to turn on the electrical automatic tightening mechanism, and directly turns on the power switch of the control panel, the machine will automatically loosen the mechanism, and then allow the worker to move it. This device demonstrates the high level of today's Soviet machine manufacturing industry. With this device, even if the drill is aimed at a very small point, there will be no slight movement when the car is started.

    In December, Taiyuan is already snowing. The Fen River, without rapids and without huge waves. But on the long Fen River Bridge, it is a tense scene. Trucks and horse-drawn carts carrying materials often crowded the bridge road. The roar of cars and the shouts of the coachmen collided and intertwined. Empty and heavy cars are running for the first heavy machinery plant in New China. And looking at the train walking at the foot of the mountain with a trail of snow-white steam, with one roar after another, it unloaded piles of machines and steel materials. The first heavy machinery plant in New China is being built at a faster pace than most people imagine.

    新中国的第一座重型机器厂
    本报记者  李翼
    新旧情况的对比，能使我们更深刻地认识现时生活。
    如果说，旧中国的机器工业，即使是机器工业最发达最出色的上海，也是带有殖民地性质的，大多数机器工厂只能为英美进口机器做些修补性的工作，最多也只能做些小的普通的机器，而不能独立地制造成部的或成套的重型机械的话，到今天，我们就必须断然地改换话头来评价新中国的机器工业了。新的，能够系统地制造重型机械，为重工业服务的重型机器厂，正在太原创建中，这一座工厂的创建，同时亦为正在筹划中的更多的重型机器厂的建立打下了基础。
    我带着一颗兴奋的心，访问了这一座机器工厂。
    我徒步从工厂大门沿着一条马路走进去，八分钟以后，到达一所小型五金库门前。斜对着这一所“小屋”（就是这小屋也比普通的礼堂大），就是高大的厂房。在这里，已经建筑起来的有高达数公尺的锻压、冷作和初加工车间。在今春，土地一解冻，一座一万余平方公尺可以翻铸七十五吨部件的铸铁车间，和一座二万余平方公尺的金工装配车间，还将继续着手建造。就是在去年冬天，工人们（这儿的工人很多来自长江流域）在凛冽的、在南方从未经受过的风雪里，已经在一万余平方公尺的土地上，树起了铸钢车间的部分钢架。这高达三十余公尺的钢结构，被漆以鲜红色，它与漫布皑皑白雪的山峦与大地相衬托，更显得十分美观。人们在想，也许不要一年的时间，就会在这昔日阡陌相连的田野里，建立起新式的平炉、电炉，几十吨重的钢件，将源源不断地被铸造出来。
    有了重型工具机，才能谈得上重型机械如冶炼、化工、矿山机械等设备的制造问题。在这里，我们已经很清楚地看到这种可能性了。而在三年以前，当中央重工业部举行第一次全国机器工业会议时，与会的各地代表，对于建立一座重型机器厂，也还只是一项美好的理想。这厂向国外订购的机器，有相当一大部分尚未运到，已经运到的，就全部订货来说，多是一些较小型的。但就国内一般机器工厂说来，这些已是够大的了。在初加工车间，我看到一部六公尺半的龙门刨。据说，这在已订购而尚未运来的龙门刨中，只能算是较小型的。我又看过一部五公尺的立式车床，这是一个重约一百五十吨，占地竟达一百平方公尺的庞然大物。有了像这样大的车床，反而觉得厂房太小了。虽然厂房已是够高的。这是一部可以拆开来搬运的车床。在这部车床运来以前，中央重工业部曾调拨给太原重机厂两部同样大小但只能整运的立式车床。由于正太铁路隧道太小，不能搬运，只好做罢。隧道小，机器大，运不来，这就是今天我们面临着的新课题。然而，这又何尝不是迈向工业化途中一项令人愉快的“困难”呢？
    工程师同志把我带进一座锻压车间里来。在这一车间里两部五吨汽锤和一部一千吨的水压机，正在逐步的安装。看了这些设备，人们禁不住要发生强烈地力的感觉。那是究竟有多大力气的东西？也许很多人到过普通的机器工厂，亲自看到过汽锤锻压钢铁的情形，汽锤的锤击声连耳膜都会感到疼痛的。但是，一般的汽锤，也才只有一吨的四分之一或二分之一。一吨或两吨的，可就真算是了不起的了。然而，在这里，那就只能是小弟弟。在这里，一座更大的锻压车间，已在筹划中。
    当我把整个已有的建筑都看过之后，又数次地依照工厂的总布置图察看了今年即将着手兴建的工程。我觉得这个工厂正在兴建中的交通运输网，是一个伟大的体系。在工厂的西部，是一座本厂专用的车站，另有七道总共约二十公里的支线通达各个车间。各个车间的原料、半成品和成品，全部用火车、电车和少部分的汽车运送。这里，我们完全可想像得到，那样重几十吨或成百吨的钢铁铸件，人的两手是难以直接为力的。而把铸钢、铸铁、锻压、冷作以及初加工车间的半成品汇总起来送往金工装配车间的，是一道长达七百公尺的室外空中大吊车。这吊车就好像是一位多孩子的母亲，提起每一个孩子——车间的产品，归汇入一个大的框篮——核心的金工装配车间去。使它最后装配成一件一件的成品。这一交通运输网的特点是：一、一般地不使用体力搬运，而是用机械替代了人力。二、使用吊车联系各个车间，减少了火车和电车的运输线路，缩短了半成品的运转时间，减低了运输成本。三、火车电车路在下，吊车在空中，使各车间在将半成品运往金工装配车间时，不致发生互相扰乱的情况。
    这是一座在苏联专家用社会主义先进技术经验帮助与指导，由中国工程技术人员设计而兴建的工厂。建筑这样一座重型机器厂，就国内的第一流机械专家说来，也还完全是一个崭新的课题。国内的不少机械专家，是曾经到英、美、德等资本主义国家留过学或实习过的。但是，他们所能接触到的常常仅是一座工厂的一小部分，能看到或摸熟一座工厂全部的，是绝少的或没有的。在这座工厂担任技术室主任的苏知俭工程师对我说，他曾在奥地利的一座军火工厂中实习六个月，然而，他实习的地方最多也只有现今这座工厂的五金库房那么大小。这样，在建设我国空前未有的重型机器厂的课题面前，从设计到施工，是有着许多不容轻视的困难的。例如，像这样高大的厂房究竟应该怎样正确地设计，各个车间里的机器应该安多少部，应该如何做到经济上的合理等等，没有一项是早先经历过而胸有成竹的。这样，就非得大开脑筋不可了。于是，一九五○年秋，在上海就聚集了成百的工程技术人员，采取集体研讨的方式进行设计。纵然这些初步设计后来不只更改过十次八次，但是，我们应该承认，这在中国工程技术界来说，不能不说是一次大胆而有历史意义的尝试。
    例如，初步设计时，不少人认为应该越大越好；所有机器都应该是世界上第一二流的，产品样数繁多，兼容并包；厂房之间和厂房以内遗留的余地应该大些，以便扩充，而没有周密地考虑到一座工厂在经济上的合理性和技术上的先进性，使其成为一个谐合地、有节奏的有机体。在苏联专家数次热心地、令人难以忘却的帮助下，这些由错误思想而产生的不少错误和缺点，都得到了纠正。例如：将工厂的总布置图来了一次大更改，把不该有那样大的厂房缩小了；厂房之间的距离由原来的一百五十公尺缩改为六十公尺。这样不仅大大减低了生产成本，而且提高了土地的利用面积。而最重要的，是苏联专家帮助我们树立了社会主义的经济核算思想。即应以现实技术条件，决定工厂的规模和产品种类；各车间的设备应该与产品数量取得平衡，使其充分发挥效率。
    这几年，怀恨新中国的杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流的战争贩子们，曾大喊着并百般威胁着他的一些附庸国家，停止向我国输出所谓战略物资，企图从经济上窒息我国。但是，当我们亲眼看到了这一座工厂的机械设备之后，我们可以这样说：你们这些无耻之流的阴谋诡计是彻头彻尾的失败了。苏联和东欧人民民主国家以及德意志民主共和国的工人阶级，给了我们以无私的援助。新的，大型的各种机器正在不断运来。而这些机器所具有优点，又远非美英等一些资本主义国家所制造的机器所能赶得上的。来自这些国家的机器有一个共同的特点是：机器精密；结构合理；电气操作部门集中，使用安全；生产效率高。我曾参观过一部苏联制造的摇臂钻床。那车床的设计者，为着工人的安全，可以说想的无微不至。当使用它的工人，由于一时的疏忽、忘记了打开电气自动松紧机关，而直然开动操纵盘的电门时，机器就会自动地把机关松开，然后再听任工人的摆布移动。这一项装置，正表明了今天苏联机器制造业的高度水平。有了这一装置，即使钻头对准极小的一点，一开车也不致于发生丝毫的移动。
    十二月在太原，已是雪花纷飞的时候了。汾河，没有激流，没有巨浪。但在长长的汾河桥上，却是一幅紧张的图景。载料的汽车与马车常常把桥道挤得水泄不通。汽车的鼻声和马车夫的叱喝声互撞着，交织成一片。空车和重车都在为新中国的第一座重型机器厂而奔驰。而放眼看那行走在山脚下拖着一道雪白蒸气的火车，随着一次又一次的吼声，而卸下了成堆的机器和钢料。新中国的第一座重型机器厂，正以较一般人的想像为快的速度建设中。
