    At a time when our country's large-scale economic construction is beginning, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has made some revisions to the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China," appropriately expanding the scope of implementation of the labor insurance regulations, increasing labor insurance benefits, and deciding to implement them from January 1, 1953. This move once again demonstrates how much the Chinese Communist Party, headed by our great leader Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government care about the lives of our workers and staff. At the same time, it also shows that as a result of our efforts in production over the past three years, we have a material foundation for further improving the labor insurance system. The entire working class of the country should warmly support this measure by the Central People's Government and strive for its implementation.
    It has been almost two years since the promulgation of the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China." During this period, the implementation of labor insurance has achieved considerable success. According to the statistics of the Labor Protection Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as of the end of November 1952, a total of 3,861 enterprises across the country had implemented the labor insurance regulations, and a total of 3,200,2147 workers and staff enjoyed labor insurance benefits, including approximately 10 million people including workers and staff dependents. Due to the implementation of the labor insurance regulations, special difficulties in the lives of workers and staff have been resolved or alleviated, playing a significant role in improving the material lives and labor protection of workers and staff, thereby profoundly educating all workers and staff, inspiring everyone's enthusiasm for work, and strengthening the relationship between the Communist Party and the People's Government and the broad masses of workers and staff.
    However, the labor insurance regulations were formulated during the period of national economic recovery. At that time, the national financial and economic situation had not fundamentally improved, and there was a lack of experience. Therefore, some benefits (such as medical treatment for illness) were set relatively low, and only key pilot programs could be adopted. With the development of production and the fundamental improvement of the national financial and economic situation, it is entirely necessary and possible to appropriately expand the scope of implementation and moderately increase the benefit standards based on the needs of national economic construction and the demands of workers and staff.
    In terms of the scope of implementation, since basic construction work has been elevated to the top priority of the entire national economic construction work, and the basic construction team is about to expand unprecedentedly and rapidly, the revised labor insurance regulations will expand the scope of implementation to basic construction units of factories, mines, and transportation industries, as well as state-owned construction companies.
    In terms of benefits, based on more than a year of experience in implementing labor insurance, the issues of illness and medical treatment are of the greatest concern to workers and staff. The revised regulations focus on solving this problem. The provision that "the period of medical treatment during work stoppage is limited to six months" has been cancelled; although the cost of expensive medicines is in principle borne by the workers and staff themselves, those with economic difficulties can apply for subsidies; the benefits for medical treatment during work stoppage for more than three months have generally been doubled. Secondly, the original regulations stipulated that the length of service in the enterprise for old-age care was ten years, which has now been reduced to five years, so that workers and staff whose age and general length of service meet the conditions but whose length of service in the enterprise is less than ten years can enjoy old-age care benefits. The benefits for retirement pensions have also increased from 35% to 60% of wages to 50% to 70% of wages. In addition, maternity benefits, funeral expenses, funeral subsidies, and family relief funds for non-work-related deaths have also been appropriately increased based on actual circumstances.
    Obviously, this revision of the labor insurance regulations will further enhance the superior role of the labor insurance system in improving the material and cultural lives of workers and staff, thereby further promoting the political consciousness and enthusiasm for work of the broad masses of workers and staff, mobilizing them to actively participate in the great construction cause of the motherland, and striving for a happy future of socialism and communism. It is in this sense that this revision of the labor insurance regulations once again demonstrates the superiority of our country's new democratic social system and state system.
    Nevertheless, since our country's economy has only recently recovered, large-scale economic construction has just begun, and the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea is still ongoing, this revised labor insurance regulation cannot completely and thoroughly solve all the difficulties of workers and staff. Over the past two years, the state's expenditure on labor insurance has reached more than two trillion yuan. If this money were used to build factories, it could build seven to eight new-style spinning mills with 50,000 spindles. After the regulations are revised, the labor insurance expenses of enterprises will increase by about one-quarter compared to before. Under such circumstances, if we demand to expand the scope of implementation or increase labor insurance benefits, it will undoubtedly excessively increase the state's financial burden and affect the country's economic construction. For the fundamental and long-term interests of the working class and the people of the whole country, the revised regulations can only expand the scope of implementation to a certain limited extent, and can only appropriately increase the benefits based on the situation. This approach is entirely correct.
    Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must repeatedly explain to the masses of workers and staff that living standards can only be gradually improved on the basis of developing production. Enterprises that are not within the scope of implementation should, as in the past, conclude labor insurance contracts or take other measures based on specific circumstances to alleviate or resolve special difficulties in the lives of workers and staff, instead of waiting for the future. Enterprises and units that should implement the labor insurance regulations, trade union organizations, and the administrative or capitalist side of enterprises should not think that "with the regulations, everything is fine" and rely solely on the labor insurance regulations to solve all problems. Instead, they should deeply understand the difficulties of the masses, combine them with the specific circumstances within the enterprise, and take some other measures, primarily the method of mass mutual assistance, to solve the special difficulties of workers and staff outside the scope of the regulations.
    Regarding the method of implementing the revised labor insurance regulations, trade union organizations at all levels should summarize their past experiences to guide the work of grassroots organizations. Generally speaking, the following issues should be paid special attention to:
    1. It is necessary to conduct extensive publicity work in enterprises implementing labor insurance, so that every worker and staff member can understand the main spirit and implementation content of this revision of the regulations. Then, in units where labor insurance committees have been established, reorganize or strengthen the organization; in units where labor insurance committees have not been established or have been established but are only a formality, organizations should be established as soon as possible, and activists who are most closely connected with the masses and enthusiastic about labor insurance work should be elected to take on this work. Units that are within the scope of this expanded implementation should prepare well, hold short-term training courses, study the labor insurance regulations and related documents, and carry out labor insurance card registration work (in enterprises that have already implemented the regulations, workers and staff who have not been registered should also be registered retroactively). If it is difficult to concentrate on registration at one time, the method of reviewing and registering workers and staff when they apply for labor insurance benefits can be adopted to ensure that workers and staff can enjoy the rights they deserve in a timely manner, and then labor insurance committees should be established in accordance with the organizational rules of the labor insurance committees. This is an important condition to ensure the implementation of the labor insurance regulations.
    2. To ensure the implementation of the labor insurance regulations, there must be a sound system. In the past, some units were enthusiastic when they first started, but because there was no sound system, the work of the labor insurance committee turned into one labor insurance accountant handling everything in less than a few months. Therefore, whether it is a unit that has already implemented or is preparing to implement, it is necessary to pay attention to establishing a sound application and payment procedure for labor insurance, a labor insurance accounting system, a reporting and reporting system, and various meeting systems, and adhere to them to ensure that workers and staff can enjoy various labor insurance benefits in a timely and correct manner.
    3. The issue of employee illness is the most important issue in labor insurance. How to supervise and assist the administrative or capitalist side of the enterprise to improve and enrich medical and health work, pay attention to health publicity and sanitation campaigns, on the one hand, enable employees who are already ill to receive treatment quickly and recover quickly, and on the other hand, implement the principle of prevention first, is the main task of implementing the labor insurance regulations. Furthermore, according to the urgent needs of workers and staff, and the economically possible conditions of the enterprise, to realistically organize some collective labor insurance undertakings that are easy to organize (such as spare-time sanatoriums, sanatoriums, nutritional canteens, nurseries, etc.) is one of the important methods to effectively prevent the development of diseases and solve the health problems of workers and staff. Therefore, those who have already done so should strive to consolidate their past achievements and establish a rational management system to further improve it; those who have not yet done so should also organize it in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the conditions.
    Through this revision of the labor insurance regulations, the labor insurance system of New China has taken a step forward. With the continuous development of the national production cause, the continuous improvement of the degree of national industrialization, and the continuous growth of national income, the labor insurance system will also become increasingly perfect, and will inevitably be gradually promoted to other factories and mining enterprises that have not yet implemented this system. Let our working class across the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, further develop their enthusiasm and creativity in production, and ensure the completion of the national economic construction tasks. This is the best way for us to realize national industrialization and further improve our material life and continue to improve the labor insurance system.

### 为贯彻劳动保险条例而努力

    为贯彻劳动保险条例而努力
    正当我国大规模的经济建设开始的时候，中央人民政府政务院对“中华人民共和国劳动保险条例”作了若干修正，适当地扩大了劳动保险条例的实施范围，提高了劳动保险待遇，并决定自一九五三年一月一日起实施。这一措施，再次说明了以我们伟大领袖毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府是如何关心我们工人职员的生活。同时，也说明了由于我们三年来努力生产的结果，我们已有了进一步改进劳动保险制度的物质基础。全国工人阶级应热烈拥护中央人民政府这一措施，并为其贯彻执行而努力。
    “中华人民共和国劳动保险条例”的颁布，已经快两年了。在这一期间，劳动保险的实施，取得了不少的成绩。根据中华全国总工会劳保部的统计，到一九五二年十一月底止，全国实行劳动保险条例的企业共计三千八百六十一个单位，享受劳动保险待遇的职工共计三百二十万零二千一百四十七人，连同职工家属在内，约有一千万人以上。由于劳动保险条例的实施，解决了或减轻了职工生活中的特殊困难，对改进职工物质生活和劳动保护起了很大的作用，因而深刻地教育了全体职工，鼓舞了大家的劳动热情，密切了共产党及人民政府和广大职工群众的关系。
    但劳动保险条例是在国家经济恢复时期制订的，当时国家财政经济尚未根本好转，加以经验缺乏，因此有些待遇（比如疾病医疗待遇）规定得比较低，并只能采取重点试行的办法。随着生产的发展，随着国家财政经济状况的根本好转，根据国家经济建设发展的需要及职工的要求，适当地扩大实施范围及酌情提高待遇标准，是完全必要的，也是可能的。
    以实施范围论，由于基本建设工作已提到整个国家经济建设工作的首位，基本建设的队伍即将空前地迅速地扩大起来，修改后的劳动保险条例，就将实施范围扩大到工厂、矿场和交通事业的基本建设单位及国营建筑公司。
    从待遇方面说，根据一年多来实行劳动保险的经验，疾病及医疗问题，最为职工所关切。修改后的条例就着重地解决了这一问题。“停工医疗期间以六个月为限”的规定取消了；贵重药费虽原则上由职工本人负担，但经济困难的可以申请补助；停工医疗在三个月以上的待遇，一般都增加了一倍。其次，原条例规定养老的本企业工龄为十年，现降低为五年，使年龄和一般工龄都符合条件而本企业工龄不满十年的职工可以享受养老待遇。退职养老金的待遇也由工资的百分之三十五至六十增为工资的百分之五十至七十。此外，生育待遇，丧葬费，丧葬补助费，非因工死亡的家属救济费，也均酌量实际情况而有所增加。
    显然，这次劳动保险条例的修改，将更加发挥劳动保险制度在改善职工群众物质文化生活上的优越作用，从而更加促使广大职工的政治觉悟和劳动热情，动员他们积极参加祖国的伟大建设事业，并努力争取社会主义和共产主义的幸福前途。正是在这个意义上，这次劳动保险条例的修改，再一次显示了我国新民主主义社会制度和国家制度的优越性。
    尽管如此，由于我们国家的经济还恢复不久，大规模的经济建设刚刚开始，抗美援朝的斗争还在继续进行，所以这次修改的劳动保险条例，还不可能全部地、彻底地解决职工的所有困难。两年来国家支出的劳动保险费用，达两万多亿元，如果拿这些钱去兴办工厂，可以修建新式的五万纺锭的纱厂七个到八个。在修改条例后，企业方面的劳动保险费用的开支将比以前增加四分之一左右。在这样的情况下，如果再要求扩大实施范围或提高劳动保险待遇，无疑即将过分增加国家的财政负担，影响国家的经济建设事业。为了工人阶级和全国人民的根本利益和长远利益，修改后的条例，只能把实施范围作一定限度的扩大，也只能酌量情况将待遇予以适当的提高。这种作法是完全正确的。
    因此，各级工会组织，必须反复地向职工群众说明只有在发展生产的基础上才能逐步改善生活的道理。不属于实施范围以内的企业，应当像过去一样，根据具体情况，订立劳动保险合同或采取其他的办法，来减轻或解决职工生活中的特殊困难，不能坐等将来。应当实行劳动保险条例的企业单位，工会组织及企业的行政方面或资方，也不要以为“有了条例，万事大吉”，一切问题都靠劳动保险条例来解决，而应该深入地了解群众的困难，结合企业内的具体情况，采取一些其他的方法，首先是群众互助的方法，替职工解决条例范围以外的特殊困难。
    关于贯彻执行修改后的劳动保险条例的方法，各级工会组织都应当总结一下过去的经验，用以指导基层组织的工作。一般说来，以下几个问题是应当特别注意的。
    一、必须在实行劳动保险的企业中，进行广泛宣传工作，使每一个职工都能明了此次修改条例的主要精神及实施内容。然后在已建立劳动保险委员会的单位中整顿组织或加强组织；没有建立劳动保险委员会或虽已建立但流于形式的单位，应从速建立组织，选举最能密切联系群众热心劳动保险工作的积极分子担任这项工作。属于此次扩大实施范围内的单位，基层工会要做好准备工作，举办短期训练班，学习劳动保险条例及有关文件，进行劳动保险卡片登记工作（在已实行条例的企业内，未登记过的职工，也要补行登记），如果集中一次登记有困难，可采取职工在申请享受劳动保险待遇时即予审查登记的办法，以保证职工及时享受应得的权利，然后根据劳动保险委员会组织通则成立劳动保险委员会。这是保证劳动保险条例实施的重要条件。
    二、保证劳动保险条例的贯彻执行，必须有健全的制度。过去，有些单位开始实行时轰轰烈烈，但由于没有健全的制度，不到几个月，劳动保险委员会的工作变成了劳保会计一人办事。因此，无论已实行或准备实行的单位，必须注意建立健全的劳动保险的申请支付手续、劳动保险会计制度、表报、报告制度及各种会议制度，并坚持下去，以保证职工及时地并正确地享受各项劳动保险待遇。
    三、职工疾病问题是劳动保险中最主要的问题，如何督促、协助企业行政方面或资方改进充实医疗卫生工作，重视卫生宣传及清洁运动，一方面使已患病的职工能够迅速地得到治疗并迅速地恢复健康，一方面贯彻以预防为主的方针，是贯彻实施劳动保险条例的主要工作。还有，根据职工的迫切需要，和本企业经济可能的条件，实事求是地举办某些易于举办的集体劳动保险事业（如业余疗养所、疗养所、营养食堂、托儿所等），是有效地预防疾病的发展及解决职工疾病问题的重要方法之一。所以已办的要努力巩固过去的成绩，建立合理的经营管理制度，把它进一步办好；未办的也应根据条件，有计划、有步骤地举办起来。
    经过这次劳动保险条例的修改，新中国的劳动保险制度已经向前迈进了一步。随着国家生产事业的不断发展，国家工业化的程度的不断提高，国民收入的不断增长，劳动保险制度也将日趋完善，并且必将一步一步推行到其他尚未实行这一制度的厂矿企业中去。让我们全国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，更加发挥生产上的积极性和创造精神，保证国家经济建设任务的完成。这就是我们实现国家工业化和进一步改善物质生活及达到继续改进劳动保险制度的最好办法。
