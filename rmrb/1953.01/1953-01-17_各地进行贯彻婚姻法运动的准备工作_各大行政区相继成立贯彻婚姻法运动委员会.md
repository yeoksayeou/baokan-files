    Xinhua News Agency reports: A large-scale Marriage Law implementation movement will be launched nationwide in March this year. To carry out this movement in a planned and step-by-step manner, various regions are actively making preparations.

    The major administrative areas of North China, Northeast China, Central-South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and the two municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin have successively established Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees. In North China, Zhang Panshi is the director; in Northeast China, Li Zhuoran is the director; in Central-South China, Li Xiannian is the director; in Southwest China, Wang Weizhou is the director; and in Northwest China, Ma Xiwu is the director. In Beijing and Tianjin, the deputy mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu De serve as directors, respectively. Some of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees in provinces (cities) under the major administrative areas have already been established, while others are in preparation. All levels of Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees have established offices to conduct research, exchange experiences, compile propaganda materials, and receive the masses.

    To gain an in-depth understanding of the situation, create experience to guide the movement, and ensure the healthy progress of the Marriage Law implementation movement, the major administrative areas and provincial (municipal) Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees have dispatched cadres to delve into counties, townships, and urban streets to conduct investigations and pilot work for the Marriage Law implementation movement. North China has already organized three work teams to conduct investigations and pilot work in Hebei, Shanxi, and Tianjin. The Northwest has also organized two work teams, which departed for Shaanxi and Gansu provinces on the 11th of this month to conduct pilot work in conjunction with provincial, municipal, and county leading bodies. They plan to select one or two townships in Xianyang, Shaanxi, and Lanzhou and Yuzhong, Gansu, for key pilot projects, with an estimated trial period of twenty days. East China has begun pilot projects for the Marriage Law implementation movement in key districts, townships, and streets of Minqing and Hui'an in Fujian Province, Qingpu and Wuxi in Jiangsu Province, and Wendeng and Dezhou in Shandong Province. The Tianjin Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee inspection team has systematically investigated marriage issues in four streets and eighteen large and small factory systems. The committee recently transferred more than forty cadres to carry out key pilot work. Henan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces, where pilot work started earlier, have announced the completion of pilot projects in seventy-nine townships. Recently, the Central-South China Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee Office initially summarized the experience of the pilot work.

    The administrative regions and provincial Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees and relevant agencies have begun or are preparing to train cadres and cultivate key workers for the Marriage Law implementation movement in various ways. Guangdong Province has begun holding Marriage Law training classes. The Hubei Provincial Party School of the Communist Party of China, the Hubei Provincial School of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Workers' Cadre Training Class have also studied the Marriage Law. The Hubei Provincial Party School of the Communist Party of China and the Hubei Provincial School of the Youth League will send students to participate in the Marriage Law implementation work.

    Propaganda work is a major task in the Marriage Law implementation movement. Various regions are actively preparing to formulate propaganda plans and compile propaganda materials. The Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has convened a Marriage Law propaganda work conference, which determined the propaganda's direction and plan. The Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau plans to organize and train various propaganda teams in a planned manner, mobilize clubs, literacy classes, reading groups, and blackboards to focus on publicizing the Marriage Law in March. The Southwest People's Publishing House has decided to publish a large number of Marriage Law propaganda materials, with an estimated circulation of more than one million copies. Jiangxi Province has already printed 120,000 copies of propaganda materials such as Q&As on marriage issues. The Northwest is actively preparing to hold a Marriage Law exhibition. Tianjin has also decided to hold a Marriage Law exhibition around the Spring Festival, and at the same time mobilize the city's literary and drama workers to participate in the Marriage Law propaganda activities.
