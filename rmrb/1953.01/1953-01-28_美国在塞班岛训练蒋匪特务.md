Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 26th: According to a report from Guam by "Chicago Tribune" reporter Simmons, the US Navy took over Saipan and Tinian Islands, formerly administered by the Department of the Interior, on January 1st. Simmons pointed out that after the Navy took over these islands, it prohibited journalists from going there, and even restricted Navy personnel from going to Saipan.

According to Simmons, Saipan has become a training ground for Chiang Kai-shek bandits engaged in terrorist activities, who are transported by plane from Taiwan. Simmons continued: "General Chennault's Civil Air Transport planes transport Chinese to Saipan. Explosions and the sound of small arms fire can be heard from the training grounds on the island... Small groups of Chinese can occasionally be seen in the countryside, but they are always accompanied by Americans."

    美国在塞班岛训练蒋匪特务
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：“芝加哥论坛报”记者西蒙斯发自关岛的消息说，美国海军已于一月一日接管了以前由内政部管辖的塞班岛与提尼安岛。西蒙斯指出，海军接管这些岛屿后，就禁止新闻记者前往，甚至海军人员前往塞班岛也予以限制。
    据西蒙斯说，塞班岛已变成从台湾用飞机运来的从事恐怖活动的蒋介石匪徒的训练场。西蒙斯继续说：“陈纳德少将的民航队飞机把中国人运往塞班岛。从岛上的训练场中传出爆炸巨响与轻型武器的射击声……在乡村中偶尔可以看到小群的中国人，但是经常有美国人陪着。”
