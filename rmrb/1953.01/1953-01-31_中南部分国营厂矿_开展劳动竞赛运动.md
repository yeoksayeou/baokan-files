Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 30th: Thirty-five state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Central and South China region have launched labor emulation campaigns starting in January this year. Other factories and mines are actively preparing for labor emulation. This labor emulation campaign is being conducted on the basis of the initial success of the first step of the production reform movement in factories and mines throughout the region. The main purpose of this competition is to further improve labor productivity to ensure the completion of the 1953 production and financial plan, formulate advanced average quotas, and lay the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system. To achieve the above objectives, the labor emulation campaign in factories and mines will focus on promoting advanced working methods and advanced working experience. The Central and South Coal Industry Administration Bureau and the Electricity Administration Bureau will soon hold advanced experience exchange conferences. To strengthen the leadership of promoting advanced experience, Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally went deep into the cotton mill to investigate and research. In terms of competition methods, in order to overcome the past problem of rushing into action all at once, factories and mines emphasize carrying out the competition in groups, gradually spreading from point to area. At the same time, the issues of safe production and quality assurance were raised from the beginning to prevent the tendency of only paying attention to increasing quantity and neglecting quality and increasing accidents after the competition was launched. Before launching the labor emulation campaign, all factories and mines followed the decision of the Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made at the industrial and mining work conference held in August last year, and initially carried out production reform work. Many factories and mines have cleared their assets, verified their funds, and reformed the bloated management organizations, reducing levels, and making management work face production. When carrying out preliminary reform work, factories and mines mobilized the masses of workers to discuss and formulate production and financial plans. The plans formulated by many workshops and groups have exceeded the factory's set targets. In the discussion of the plan, the masses of workers have actively sought shortcuts, tapped potential, and put forward rationalization proposals. The Central China Iron and Steel Company, Pingxiang Coal Mine, and other twelve units have put forward more than 6,900 rationalization proposals, many of which have solved key problems in production after being adopted.

    中南部分国营厂矿
    开展劳动竞赛运动
    【新华社武汉三十日电】中南区已有三十五个国营和地方国营厂矿职工，在今年一月开始展开劳动竞赛：其他工厂矿山也在积极地进行劳动竞赛的准备工作。这次劳动竞赛运动，是在全区各厂矿生产改革运动的第一步工作已获得初步成果的基础上进行的。这次竞赛的主要目的是进一步提高劳动生产率，以保证完成一九五三年的生产财务计划和制订平均先进定额，为实行经济核算制打下基础。为了达到以上目的，各厂矿的劳动竞赛运动将以推广先进工作方法和推广先进工作经验为中心环节，中南煤业管理局和电业管理局最近都要召开先进经验交流大会。为了加强对推广先进经验的领导，中共武汉市委第一副书记李尔重亲自深入纱厂调查研究。在竞赛的方法上，各厂矿为克服过去一轰而起的毛病，强调以小组为单位展开竞赛，由点到面逐渐铺开；同时一开始就提出安全生产和保证质量的问题，防止竞赛展开后只顾提高数量忽视质量和事故加多的偏向。在开展劳动竞赛运动以前，各厂矿都遵照中共中央中南局去年八月召开的工矿工作会议的决定，初步进行了生产改革工作。许多厂矿清理了资产，核定了资金，改革了臃肿庞大的管理机构，减少层次，做到了管理工作面向生产。各厂矿在初步进行改革工作时，发动职工群众讨论制订生产财务计划。许多车间、小组订出的计划都突破了厂定指标。职工群众在讨论计划中纷纷找窍门、挖潜力，提出合理化建议。华中钢铁公司、萍乡煤矿等十二个单位提出的合理化建议达六千九百多条，其中有许多建议被采用以后，解决了生产上的关键问题。
