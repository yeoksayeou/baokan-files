The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant actively cultivates cadres and workers during its basic construction work, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient staff.

At the beginning of the plant's construction, there was only one repair group, and the construction force was extremely weak, unable to cope with the needs of large-scale construction projects. The plant leadership adopted a self-reliance policy, recruiting and entrusting other agencies to introduce staff on the one hand, and using methods such as establishing various training classes, establishing technical schools, and launching apprenticeships led by masters to cultivate and train employees and expand their strength on the other hand. Now, the plant has established a civil engineering team of more than 1,600 people, and the 238 staff members recruited and entrusted to introduce have been assigned to various jobs. A cold work workshop capable of undertaking all metal structure roof truss projects has been established. From December of the year before last to November of last year, four training classes were held for accounting statistics, electrical engineering, labor wages, and planning, with a total of 93 participants. Now the accounting statistics and electrical engineering training class students have graduated and been assigned to various departments to work. In order to train skilled workers, a technical school for 480 people was established in May 1950. 90% of the 92 graduates from the first phase of the school can reach the third-grade technician level. There have also been significant achievements in apprenticeships; in the cold work workshop alone, 30 out of 200 odd-job workers can now participate in production work, and 40 can perform auxiliary work.

    太原重型机器厂培养训练大批建设人材
    太原重型机器厂在基本建设工作中积极培养干部、工人，克服了职工不足的困难。
    该厂在建厂开始时，只有一个修缮组，施工力量极为薄弱，应付不了大规模建设工程的需要。该厂领导方面采取了自力更生的方针，一方面招聘、委托其他机关介绍工作人员，一方面用创办各种训练班、建立技工学校、发动师傅带徒弟等办法培养训练职工，扩大自己的力量。现在该厂已经成立了一千六百余人的土木工程队，招聘、委托介绍来的二百三十八个职员已分别担任了各种工作。一个可以担负全部金属结构屋架工程任务的冷作车间已经建立起来。从前年十二月至去年十一月举办了会计统计、电气、劳动工资、计划等四个训练班，参加学习的共九十三人。现在会计统计和电气两个训练班的学员已经毕业，分配到各部门工作。为了培养技术工人，一九五零年五月创办了一个四百八十人的技工学校。该校第一期毕业的九十二个学员，有百分之九十能达到三级技工。在带徒弟方面也有显著成绩，单冷作车间二百个杂工现在就有三十个人能参加生产工作，有四十个人能进行辅助工作。
