    The Mudanjiang Railway Factory is Too Irresponsible: Bad Locomotives Go In, and Bad Locomotives Come Out
    Editor: The Mudanjiang Railway Factory is slipshod in repairing locomotives, and the quality is too poor. This not only causes waste from rework and re-repair, but also has a very bad impact on the normal operation of the railway.
    Last November, the Jilin Railway Administration handed over four locomotives to the factory for repair. After they left the factory, three of them were returned for re-repair; the other one could only be used after three repairs. For example, a certain locomotive of the Tumen section was found to have cracks in the frame beam after it was overhauled and left the factory, making it unusable. A certain locomotive of the Jilin section leaked from the bottom of the water tank due to corrosion after running only eight kilometers after being repaired at the factory. What is particularly intolerable is that when these locomotives were sent back to the factory for re-repair, the factory refused to let them enter, claiming that there was no space in the factory.
    This slipshod practice of the factory not only causes waste from rework and re-repair, but also sometimes affects the normal operation of the railway. For example, after a certain locomotive was overhauled at the factory on November 18, when it was pulling the 568th freight train to Ludao, the driver found that the exhaust was not correct and could not continue to pull the train, so he had to return it to the factory for re-repair. The train was delayed at Ludao for four hours and twenty-one minutes, disrupting the tight schedule. After inspection, it was found that the steam chamber body of this locomotive was cracked for three hundred millimeters. Fortunately, the driver discovered it early, otherwise it might have caused a major accident.
    This slipshod and irresponsible work style of the factory is consistent. We have repeatedly raised opinions, but they have not accepted them. Section Chief Kong of the factory's inspection section even sophistically said: "Small locomotives are difficult to repair!" In fact, among the four locomotives sent by the Jilin Railway Administration for repair in November, only one was a small locomotive. We believe that the Mudanjiang Railway Factory should carefully check its work and correct this irresponsible work style.

### 牡丹江铁路工厂太不负责坏机车进厂还是坏机车出厂

    牡丹江铁路工厂太不负责坏机车进厂还是坏机车出厂
    编辑同志：牡丹江铁路工厂修理机车时粗制滥造，质量太糟，不仅造成返工重修的浪费，而且对铁路正常运行有很不好的影响。
    去年十一月，吉林铁路管理局交由该厂修理了四台机车，出厂后就有三台返厂重修；另外一台也是经三次修理后才能运用。如图们段某号机车在该厂大修出厂后，经检查车架横梁有裂纹，不能用。吉林段某号机车在该厂修理后刚运行八公里，水柜底部就腐蚀漏水。而尤其令人不能容忍的是：当这些机车送回该厂重修时，该厂竟借口厂里没地方，不让入厂。
    该厂这种粗制滥造的做法，不但造成返工重修的浪费，而且有时还会影响铁路的正常运行。如某号机车十一月十八日在该厂大修出厂后，牵引五六八次货物列车运行到鹿道时，司机就发现排汽不正，不能继续牵引，只好又退回该厂重修。列车因在鹿道停留了四点二十一分，打乱了紧密运行图。后经检查，原来这台机车的汽室体裂了三百公厘，幸而司机及早发现，否则可能造成重大事故。
    该厂这种粗制滥造、不负责任的作风是一贯的。我们曾不断地提出意见，他们一直不接受，该厂检查科的孔科长还强词夺理地说：“小型机车不好修理！”事实上，十一月份吉林铁路管理局送去修理的四台机车中，只有一台是小型机车。我们认为：牡丹江铁路工厂应当很好地检查工作，改正这种不负责任的工作作风。
