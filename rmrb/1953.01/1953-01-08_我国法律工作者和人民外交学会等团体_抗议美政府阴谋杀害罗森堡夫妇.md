Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Chinese legal workers, the People's Diplomatic Association and scientific workers, are united in expressing their angry protest against the U.S. government's barbaric trampling of human rights in sentencing American peace activists Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to death on trumped-up charges, and its intention to carry out this shameful verdict next week. They demand that the U.S. government immediately halt the execution of the Rosenbergs and restore their freedom.

Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 7th: "The U.S. government, disregarding the protests of progressive people in the U.S. and around the world, has sentenced peace-loving, innocent Rosenbergs and his wife, Ethel, to death on fabricated 'espionage' charges. This despicable crime of fabricating facts and persecuting progressive people by the U.S. government cannot but arouse our great anger. We firmly oppose and protest this barbaric act of the U.S. government that violates human justice and tramples on human rights!"

Throughout the trial of the Rosenbergs, the U.S. judicial authorities lacked any credible evidence and absurdly and shamefully concluded that political or social opinions were sufficient to constitute the crime of "espionage." This is a flagrant violation of fundamental legal principles and, as the American Civil Rights Congress pointed out, lacks even a semblance of legality. Undoubtedly, this verdict by the U.S. judicial authorities has torn off the mask of so-called "democracy" and "human rights" in the eyes of peace-loving and democratic people around the world, and nakedly exposed the U.S. judiciary as a killing machine of the U.S. rulers.

The U.S. government deliberately created this miscarriage of justice as a pretext to incite anti-Soviet and anti-Communist sentiment, intensify the suppression of the peace and democratic forces of the American people, and pave the way for their plans to expand their military, prepare for war, and launch further wars of aggression. However, this extremely vicious and evil fascist face of the U.S. government can only further arouse the hatred of peace-loving people all over the world, and the U.S. government's despicable and shameful criminal conspiracy is bound to fail.

As a legal worker, for the sake of justice, and in order to defend the peace, democracy, and freedom of the American people and the people of the world, we fully sympathize with the American people's struggle to protect human rights and to free the unjustly accused Rosenbergs. We resolutely express our righteous support for the Rosenbergs and demand that the U.S. government overturn the illegal verdict against them and immediately restore their freedom.

Chinese jurist and former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Dr. Mei Ru'ao, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: "The so-called 'Rosenberg spy case' is a naked and malicious conspiracy by the reactionary American authorities to frame peace and democracy fighters. As a legal worker, I fully sympathize with and support the appeals of the American Civil Rights Congress and the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, demanding the immediate release of the Rosenbergs or a retrial."

Mei Ru'ao continued: "After carefully reading all the documents and materials I could obtain regarding the Rosenberg case, I believe that the judgment of the U.S. Federal Court is an absurd and unprecedented judgment. Regarding the charge that Rosenberg 'leaked atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union,' the U.S. government has consistently failed to produce any conclusive or direct evidence. The evidence relied upon by the court was merely some 'confessions' from Rosenberg's brother-in-law, Greenglass, and 'testimony' from several professional agents hired by the FBI. Even from the perspective of traditional American evidence jurisprudence, the value of this evidence is equal to zero. Even the most reactionary American magazine, 'Time,' understands this, and therefore it also admits that they are 'scientifically meaningless.' The U.S. Federal Court sentenced a kind, innocent young couple to death based on some 'scientifically meaningless' fabricated evidence. What is this if not premeditated murder? The main reason why the Rosenbergs were sentenced to death is because they insisted on their belief in peace and democracy, and refused to betray themselves and serve the war profiteers, and therefore they incurred the jealousy of the U.S. ruling clique. As the Rosenbergs said in their letter:

"We want to live, we want to be reunited with our children. But we are unwilling to pay the price they are extorting from us to betray our belief in a peaceful world, in friendship and democracy." However, the Rosenbergs' belief is incompatible with the U.S. government's policy of aggression and its plans to expand its military and prepare for war, and it is incompatible with the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist hysteria that the U.S. war profiteers want to create. This is the real reason why they were sentenced to death by the U.S. court. Undoubtedly, the reactionary U.S. government wants to intimidate the growing number of Americans who support peace and democracy by killing the Rosenbergs. But this attempt will not succeed. On the contrary, it can only arouse greater anger among the American people and make the camp of American people striving for peace and democracy stronger."

Mei Ru'ao continued: "In the more than 170 years of U.S. history since its founding, U.S. courts have never sentenced any 'spy' to death in non-wartime. This time, the New York Federal Court hastily sentenced the Rosenbergs to death without any evidence, and arbitrarily rejected their legitimate request for a retrial. The U.S. Supreme Court unreasonably upheld the New York Court's unreasonable judgment. This series of absurd acts completely proves that the U.S. judicial organs are the murder tools of the U.S. monopoly capitalists and war profiteer groups. As Paul Robeson, chairman of the American Civil Rights Congress, said: 'Never in our history has a government committed such a vile crime. The whole case has proceeded in a kind of blind hatred, and the verdict lacks even a semblance of legality.'"

Mei Ru'ao finally pointed out: "Due to the corruption of the U.S. courts, all legal avenues for rescuing the innocent Rosenbergs have now been blocked. The only hope is for the U.S. President to exercise his power of pardon. If the U.S. President ignores the protests that have swept the world and stubbornly carries out the original verdict, it will only arouse greater anger among the American people and all peace-loving and just people around the world, and accelerate the collapse and demise of the U.S. reactionary ruling clique itself."

The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 7th saying: "The U.S. government has falsely accused the Rosenbergs of being the masterminds behind the theft of atomic bomb secrets, but the entire trial process has made it clear to people all over the world that this is entirely fabricated by the U.S. government and that there is no credible evidence whatsoever. People all over the world know that the Rosenberg case is part of the U.S. government's entire anti-people and anti-peace conspiracy. It shows that the U.S. government is doing everything in its power to incite anti-Soviet sentiment in order to create a new war that will allow capitalists to reap huge profits; at the same time, the U.S. government is also using the most brutal means to trample on the most basic human rights of the American people, in order to establish a fascist rule that will allow capitalists to do whatever they want. We resolutely demand that the U.S. government immediately halt the execution of the Rosenbergs, overturn this unjust verdict, and restore their freedom."

The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, and the All-china Association for Science and Technology Popularization jointly cabled U.S. President Truman on the 7th, protesting the U.S. judicial authorities' conspiracy to brutally murder the Rosenbergs. The cable reads as follows:

"When the news came that young scientists Julius Rosenberg and his wife, Ethel, had been falsely accused of 'espionage' and sentenced to death on the basis of flimsy evidence, natural scientists throughout China felt immense indignation. We believe that this is a cruel, inhumane and barbaric act. We cannot tolerate the existence of such facts that frame human lives in the world, and we cannot tolerate such an unreasonable verdict that is harmful to nature and reason. The people of the world are against this evil act, and everyone involved in the murder of Julius and Ethel must bear serious responsibility. For justice, for the freedom and right to life of the people, we protest to you and demand that you immediately release Julius and Ethel, and hope that no innocent people will be persecuted in the future!"

    抗议美政府阴谋杀害罗森堡夫妇
    据新华社讯：美国政府野蛮地蹂躏人权，以虚构的罪名，判处美国和平人士朱利叶斯·罗森堡夫妇以死刑，并将于下周执行这个可耻的判决。我国著名法律工作者、人民外交学会和科学工作者，一致表示愤怒抗议，要求美国政府立即停止对罗森堡夫妇判决的执行，恢复他们的自由。
    国际民主法律工作者协会副主席沈钧儒在七日对新华社记者发表谈话说：美国政府不顾美国及世界进步人民的抗议，以莫须有的“间谍”罪名，对爱好和平的、善良无辜的罗森堡及其妻子伊斯尔判处死刑。美国政府这种捏造事实迫害进步人民的卑劣罪行，不能不引起我们极大的愤怒。我们坚决反对并抗议美国政府这种违反人类正义、蹂躏人权的野蛮暴行！
    美国司法当局在审判罗森堡夫妇的全部过程中，缺乏任何令人置信的证据，竟认为政治或社会见解便足以构成“间谍”的罪名，从而作出荒谬可耻的判决，这是对基本法律原则的粗暴违反，亦正如美国民权保障大会所指出的，连表面的合法都没有了。无疑地，美国司法当局这样判决，已在全世界爱好和平、民主人们的面前，撕下了所谓“民主”和“人权”的外衣，赤裸裸地暴露了美国司法机关是美国统治者的杀人机器。
    美国政府故意制造出这个冤狱案件，企图作为借口来煽动反苏反共的情绪，加紧镇压美国人民的和平民主力量，为他们扩军备战、进一步发动侵略战争的计划铺平道路。然而美国政府这种穷凶极恶的法西斯面目，只能更进一步地引起全世界爱好和平人民的憎恶，美国政府的卑鄙可耻的罪恶阴谋必然遭受失败。
    作为一个法律工作者，为了正义，为了保卫美国人民同时也是全世界人民的和平、民主与自由，我们完全同情美国人民为保障人权，争取释放蒙受冤屈的罗森堡夫妇而进行的斗争，我们坚决地对罗森堡夫妇表示正义的声援，并要求美国政府撤销对罗森堡夫妇的非法判决，立即恢复他们的自由。
    我国法学家、前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈博士向新华社记者发表谈话说：所谓“罗森堡间谍案”是一个赤裸裸的美国反动当局陷害和平民主战士的恶毒阴谋。作为一个法律工作者，我完全同情并拥护美国民权保障大会和争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会的呼吁，要求立刻释放罗森堡夫妇或交付重审。
    梅汝璈继续说：在细心阅读了我所能得到的关于罗森堡案的一切文件和资料之后，我认为美国联邦法院的判决是一个荒谬绝伦、史罕前例的判决。对罗森堡的所谓“将原子弹秘密泄露给苏联”的罪名，美国政府始终提不出任何确凿的或直接的证据。法院所依靠的证据只是罗森堡妻弟格林格拉斯的一些“口供”和联邦调查局雇用的几个职业特务的“证言”。这种证据，即使就传统的美国证据法学的观点看来，其价值也是等于零的。关于这一点，连美国最反动的“时代”周刊都懂得，因此它也承认它们是“毫无科学意义的”。美国联邦法院拿一些“毫无科学意义”的虚构的证据去判处一对善良无辜青年夫妇的死刑，这不是蓄意的谋杀是什么？罗森堡夫妇被判死刑的主要原因是因为他们坚持他们对于和平民主的信心，不愿出卖他们自己而为战争贩子们服务，因此他们便招致了美国统治集团的嫉恨。正如罗森堡夫妇在他们的信中所说：
    “我们要活，我们要重新与孩子们聚在一起。可是我们不愿付出人家对我们勒索的代价，来出卖我们对一个和平世界的信心，对友好和民主的信心。”然而罗森堡夫妇的这种信心是和美国政府所要推进的侵略政策和扩军备战计划是不相容的，是和美国战争贩子们所要制造的反苏反共歇斯底里亚气氛不相容的，这便是他们所以被美国法院判处死刑的真正原因。无疑地，美国反动政府妄想要以杀害罗森堡夫妇去恫吓日益众多的美国拥护和平民主的人民。但是他们这种企图是不会成功的。相反地，它只能激起美国人民更大的愤怒，使美国人民争取和平民主的阵营更加壮大起来。
    梅汝璈继续谈称：在美国建国以来一百七十余年的历史上，美国法院从来没有在非战争期间判处过任何“间谍”的死刑。这次纽约联邦法院毫无证据地草草率率地判决罗森堡夫妇的死刑，并横蛮地拒绝了他们请求重审的合法要求，美国最高法院又毫无理由地维持了纽约法院的无理判决，这一系列的荒谬行为完全证明着美国的司法机关是美国垄断资本家和战争贩子集团的杀人工具。正如美国民权保障大会主席帕特逊所说：“在我国历史上，从来没有一个政府的罪行是如此卑劣。整个案件就在一种盲目的仇恨中进行，而这个宣判更连表面的合法都没有。”
    梅汝璈最后指出：由于美国法院的堕落，现在营救无辜的罗森堡夫妇的一切法律途径都被封锁了。惟一的希望是美国总统行使他的赦免权。倘使美国总统竟不顾弥漫全世界的抗议呼声，悍然执行原判，那只有引起美国人民和全世界一切爱好和平及有正义感的人民更大的愤怒，加速美国反动统治集团自己的崩溃和灭亡。
    中国人民外交学会七日发表声明说：美国政府把罗森堡夫妇诬为偷窃原子弹秘密的主犯，但案件的整个审讯过程使全世界人民都知道这完全是美国政府凭空捏造出来的，并没有任何可以令人置信的证据。全世界人民都知道罗森堡夫妇的案件是美国政府整个反人民反和平阴谋的一部分，它说明美国政府正在极尽其卑污的能事来煽动反苏空气，以利于制造使资本家获得暴利的新战争；同时美国政府也在极尽其残暴的手段蹂躏美国人民最起码的人权，以利于建立使资本家得以为所欲为的法西斯统治。我们坚决要求美国政府立即停止对罗森堡夫妇判决的执行，取消这个不公正的判决，恢复他们的自由。
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会及中华全国科学技术普及协会七日联合致电美国总统杜鲁门，抗议美国司法当局阴谋残杀罗森堡夫妇。电文如下：
    当青年科学工作者朱利叶斯·罗森堡和他的妻子伊斯尔在不足为信的证据下被诬陷为“间谍”并判处死刑消息传来，全中国的自然科学工作者都感到无比的愤慨。我们认为这是残酷、惨无人道和野蛮的行径。我们不能容忍世界上有这样陷害人类生命的事实，不能容忍这样伤天害理的无理判决。全世界的人民都反对这种丑恶行为，每一个参与谋害朱利叶斯和伊斯尔的人，都必须担负严重的责任。为了正义，为了人民的自由和生活权利，我们向你提出抗议，并要求你立即释放朱利叶斯和伊斯尔，并希望以后不再有无辜的人被迫害！
