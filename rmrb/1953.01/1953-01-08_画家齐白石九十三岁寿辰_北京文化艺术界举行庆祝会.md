Painter Qi Baishi Celebrates His 93rd Birthday
    Beijing's Cultural and Art Circles Hold Celebration

    On the 7th, it was the 93rd birthday of the famous Chinese painter Qi Baishi. The All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers and the Central Academy of Fine Arts jointly held a celebration for him. At the meeting, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government awarded him an honorary certificate.

    On the evening of the 7th, the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers and the Central Academy of Fine Arts jointly held a banquet to celebrate Qi Baishi's birthday. Premier Zhou Enlai of the Government Administration Council attended to congratulate him.

    Qi Baishi was born into a peasant family in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. Due to family poverty, he only studied for half a year. At the age of nine, he began herding cattle and cutting grass. After the age of eleven, he worked as a carpenter and woodcarver for fifteen years. He loved painting from a very young age. During his cattle herding and carpentry periods, he often studied painting late into the night after a day's work. After decades of uninterrupted and astonishingly diligent study, he finally overcame all difficulties and became a famous painter.

    Among those attending today's celebration were Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; Xu Beihong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers and President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts; and over two hundred people from cultural and art circles in the capital, as well as Qi Baishi's friends Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Shao Lizi, Lao She, Ye Gongchuo, Ouyang Yuqian, Zheng Zhenduo, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Chen Banding, Pu Xuezhai, Sun Songzhao, Wang Aishi, Hu Peihang, Yu Pingbo, Jiang Feng, Cai Ruohong, Wang Chaowen, and Gu Yuan.

    At the celebration, young art workers from the capital presented Qi Baishi with birthday gifts and flowers, expressing their respect for this veteran painter.

    Li Jishen, Xu Beihong, Lao She, Tian Han, Ye Gongchuo, and others spoke at the meeting, unanimously praising painter Qi Baishi's brilliant artistic achievements and his spirit of engaging in artistic work seriously and diligently for decades.

    Zhou Yang, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, awarded Qi Baishi an honorary certificate and spoke at the meeting. He said: "Mr. Qi Baishi is an outstanding artist of the Chinese people. He has made unique contributions to Chinese art creation. His art inherits the realistic tradition of Chinese painting and develops the characteristic of 'combining form and spirit.' Because he came from the working people, his works mostly draw on natural objects close to the daily life of ordinary people, with healthy and simple colors. The painter actively supports the People's Government and has recently used his works to participate in the movement to defend world peace." Zhou Yang also pointed out in his speech: China's artistic heritage is rich. Art workers should value and sort out these heritages and promote their excellent traditions. The characteristics of line drawing and ink painting in Chinese painting should be carefully studied and developed. All new art creations should have their own national style. Zhou Yang pointed out that comrades in the Chinese painting circles have done a lot of work beneficial to the people in the past three years, and in the future, they should unite more closely and work together to improve and develop Chinese painting, and learn from Mr. Qi Baishi's art and his spirit of hard work.

    Finally, Qi Baishi stood up to express his thanks, and his student Hu Jieqing delivered a reply on his behalf, expressing heartfelt gratitude to the People's Government, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. More than forty of Qi Baishi's works were exhibited at the celebration. (Xinhua News Agency)

    画家齐白石九十三岁寿辰
    北京文化艺术界举行庆祝会
    七日是我国著名画家齐白石九十三岁的生日。中华全国美术工作者协会、中央美术学院联合为他举行了庆祝会。会上，中央人民政府文化部授予他以荣誉奖状。
    七日晚，中华全国美术工作者协会和中央美术学院又联合举行宴会，为齐白石祝寿。政务院总理周恩来曾出席祝贺。
    齐白石出生在湖南省湘潭县一个农民家里，因家庭贫苦，只读过半年书，九岁开始放牛、打草，十一岁后，作了十五年的木匠和雕花木工。他很小的时候就喜欢画画，在放牛和作木工时期，经常是劳作一天后又学画到深夜。经过数十年的不间断的惊人的苦学，他终于突破了一切困难而成为著名的画家。
    参加今天庆祝会的有中央人民政府文化部副部长周扬，中华全国美术工作者协会主席、中央美术学院院长徐悲鸿，和首都文化艺术界人士以及齐白石的友好李济深、何香凝、邵力子、老舍、叶恭绰、欧阳予倩、郑振铎、田汉、洪深、陈半丁、溥雪齐、孙诵昭、汪蔼士、胡佩衡、俞平伯、江丰、蔡若虹、王朝闻、古元等二百多人。
    在庆祝会上，首都的年青美术工作者们曾向齐白石献寿礼，献花，表示对这一老画家的敬意。
    李济深、徐悲鸿、老舍、田汉、叶恭绰等先后在会上讲话，对画家齐白石在艺术上的光辉成就和数十年如一日的严肃刻苦地从事艺术工作的精神，一致予以极高的推崇。
    周扬在会上代表中央人民政府文化部授予齐白石以荣誉奖状，并在会上讲话。他说：“齐白石先生是中国人民卓越的艺术家、他在中国美术创造上有特异的贡献。他的艺术继承了中国绘画的现实主义传统，发挥了‘形神兼备’的特色。由于他出身劳动者，他的作品多取材于与一般人民日常生活相接近的自然风物，具有健康、朴素的色彩。画家积极地拥护人民政府，最近还用自己的作品参加了保卫世界和平的运动。”周扬还在讲话中指出：中国的美术遗产是丰富的。美术工作者应当重视和整理这些遗产，发扬其中的优良传统。对于中国画的线描和水墨等特点，应当认真地研究、发挥。一切新的美术创作，均应具有自己民族的风格。周扬指出三年来国画界的同人作了很多对人民有益的工作，今后应更加亲密地团结一致，共同为改进和发展中国画而努力，并向齐白石先生的艺术和他的刻苦劳动的精神学习。
    最后，齐白石起立致谢，并由他的学生胡洁青代致答词，表示对人民政府、共产党和毛主席的衷心感谢。庆祝会上，并展览了齐白石的作品四十多幅。  （新华社）
