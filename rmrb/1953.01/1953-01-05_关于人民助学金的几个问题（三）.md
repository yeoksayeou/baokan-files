    Several Questions Regarding People's Scholarships (3)

    Q: Should priority be given to cadre students who are transferred to universities for study when assessing People's Scholarships?

    A: The People's Scholarship standard for current staff members transferred and recommended to universities for study should be higher than that of general students. In addition to covering their personal living and study expenses, appropriate consideration should also be given to the difficulties of their families and children.

    Q: What kind of students can have their People's Scholarship calculated according to the treatment of cadre students who have left their jobs for study?

    A: Those who were originally current staff members of government agencies, military units, and people's organizations, who were transferred and recommended to universities by the respective agencies, military units, and organizations for planned cadre training and with the approval of the Ministry of Education; or those who were uniformly assigned to various universities by the Ministry of Education in 1952, can be treated as cadre students who have left their jobs for study.

    Q: Why can't some current staff members who pass the entrance examination to universities also have their People's Scholarship calculated according to the treatment of cadre students who have left their jobs for study?

    A: Staff members who originally worked in government agencies, military units, and people's organizations, who were directly introduced to schools by their original units without the approval of the Ministry of Education; or who voluntarily took the entrance examination and were admitted after the agencies, military units, and organizations issued certificates; regardless of whether they are newly enrolled or returning to school, and regardless of whether they were originally on a salary system or a supply system, their People's Scholarship is calculated according to the standard for ordinary students.

    Q: What kind of treatment should students who originally enjoyed cadre supply system treatment or student supply system treatment in other universities receive if they transfer to general universities?

    A: Students who originally enjoyed cadre supply system treatment or student supply system treatment in other universities should, in principle, maintain their original treatment until graduation when transferring to a new school, provided they obtain a supply certificate from the original school. The new school will include them in the corresponding level for calculating their People's Scholarship. However, supply system students who graduated from secondary schools and took the entrance examination cannot maintain their original treatment and must be handled according to the People's Scholarship regulations for universities.

    关于人民助学金的几个问题（三）
    问：对抽调到高等学校中学习的干部学生，在评定人民助学金时应否首先照顾？
    答：抽调保送入高等学校学习的现职工作人员，他们的人民助学金标准应该高于一般学生，除解决其个人生活学习费用外，还应适当照顾其家属子女生活的困难。
    问：什么样的学生才能按调干离职学生待遇计算其人民助学金？
    答：原为政府机关、部队及人民团体的现职工作人员，经各该机关、部队、团体为了有计划地培养干部而抽调保送至高等学校学习并经教育部同意者；或一九五二年由教育部统一分配至各高等学校学习者，可按调干离职学生待遇。
    问：为什么有的现职工作人员投考入高等学校学习的，也不能按调干离职学生待遇计算其人民助学金？
    答：原为政府机关、部队及人民团体的工作人员，未经教育部同意即由原单位直接介绍至学校学习者；或由个人志愿自行投考，考取后经机关、部队、团体出具证明者；不论其新入学及复学，不分其原为工资制或供给制，一律按普通学生计算人民助学金。
    问：原在其他高等学校享受干部供给制待遇或学生供给制待遇的同学，现转入一般高等学校学习，他应该享受什么待遇？
    答：原在其他高等学校享受干部供给制待遇或学生供给制待遇的学生，转入新学校时，取得原学校之供给证明，原则上仍维持其原待遇至毕业为止，由新校列入相当等级计算其人民助学金。但中等学校毕业投考之供给制学生不能照原待遇维持，须按高等学校人民助学金办法办理。
