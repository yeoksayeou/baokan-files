    Tianjin Municipal People's Government Transfers Cadres
    To Strengthen Basic Construction Forces
    In order to strengthen basic construction forces, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government has planned to transfer 1,061 cadres from the local state-owned industrial bureau, the municipal government system, the public security bureau, and the People's Bank of China to the municipal basic construction departments to serve as leading backbones. The local state-owned industrial bureau completed the first batch of cadre transfers before the new year, with more than 90 of them (including 29 cadres at the county level and above) being transferred to the municipal basic construction departments. The remaining cadres were assigned to the bureau's internal basic construction institutions. The leading cadres of most units in the municipal government system overcame departmentalism and conservative thinking and completed the cadre transfer plan. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce not only completed the cadre transfer task on schedule according to the requirements of the leadership but also transferred the backbone cadres originally planned to be assigned to other departments of the bureau to the basic construction departments.
    In this cadre transfer to participate in basic construction, the leading cadres of a few units did not have enough understanding of the importance of basic construction and showed serious departmentalism that disregarded the overall situation. The Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education initially ignored the instructions of the Personnel Department of the Municipal People's Government and failed to complete the task of transferring cadres on schedule. Some units lacked a sense of responsibility for national economic construction and transferred some old, weak, and less capable cadres from the organs to make up the numbers. These erroneous ideas seriously affected the smooth completion of the cadre transfer work.
    In this cadre transfer to participate in basic construction, most units attached importance to ideological mobilization, which made all cadres realize that basic construction is the key to national industrialization. The enthusiasm of the transferred cadres was extremely high. They all expressed that they would humbly learn, resolutely overcome difficulties, and complete the glorious tasks given by the Party and the government in their new work posts. Cadres who were not transferred also guaranteed that production would not be delayed due to the transfer of cadres. Some units have supplemented new cadres after transferring cadres according to the list of cadres to be trained.
    In order to continue to enrich the strength of the basic construction departments, the city is vigorously carrying out the adjustment of technical personnel. Units with surplus technical personnel or unreasonable use of technical personnel will reallocate technical personnel and concentrate their use. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is also preparing to transfer a group of trade union work cadres to strengthen the leadership of the construction trade union.

### 天津市人民政府抽调干部  加强基本建设力量

    天津市人民政府抽调干部
    加强基本建设力量
    天津市人民政府为了加强基本建设力量，已有计划地由地方国营工业局、市人民政府系统、公安局和人民银行等单位，抽调干部一千零六十一人，分配到市属基本建设部门中去，充当领导骨干。地方国营工业局已在年前完成了第一批抽调干部的工作，其中有九十余名（内有县级以上干部二十九人）被输送到市属基本建设部门。其余的干部则分配到局内的基本建设机构。市人民政府系统大部分单位的领导干部克服了本位主义和保守思想，完成了输送干部计划。市工商局不仅按照领导上要求的条件，按期完成了干部输送任务，而且又将该局原准备分配到其他工作部门的骨干干部，也输送到基本建设部门中去。
    在这次抽调干部参加基本建设工作中，也有少数单位的领导干部，对基本建设的重要性认识不足，表现了严重不顾整体的本位主义思想。市文化事业管理局，开始时对市人民政府人事处的指示，竟采取置之不理的态度，没有按期完成输送干部的任务。也有少数单位对国家经济建设缺乏责任心，在输送干部时，把机关中的一些老弱和能力较差的干部输送出去充数。这些错误思想，严重地影响输送干部工作的顺利完成。
    在这次抽调干部参加基本建设工作中，大部单位由于重视了思想动员，使全体干部认清基本建设是国家工业化的关键，被抽调的干部情绪极为高涨。他们都表示到了新工作岗位一定要虚心学习，坚决克服困难，完成党和政府给予的光荣任务。没有被抽调的干部，也保证决不因抽调干部而耽误生产。有些单位已根据培养干部名单，在输送干部之后，补充了新的干部。
    为了继续充实基本建设部门的力量，全市正大力进行技术人员调整工作，凡技术人员有敷余，或使用不合理的单位，都要将技术人员进行重新调配，集中使用。市总工会最近也准备输送一批工会工作干部，加强建筑工会的领导力量。
