    National state-owned coal mines overfulfilled the production plan for 1952. As of the end of December last year, 105.4% of the plan had been completed, an increase of 28.7% compared to 1951. If the planned output of local state-owned, jointly state-private, and private coal mines is added, the total is more than double that of 1949.
    In terms of safety, due to the fundamental resolution of ventilation problems and the initial resolution of roof management problems, gas explosions and roof collapse accidents in mines have been greatly reduced. According to preliminary statistics, the number of deaths in coal mine accidents nationwide has decreased by 75% compared to 1949.
    Over the past year, the production efficiency of coal mines across the country has increased quarter by quarter. Taking 1949 as 100, the first quarter of 1952 was 196, the second quarter was 213, the third quarter was 227, and the fourth quarter was 260. The production efficiency of many relatively advanced mines in Northeast China and North China has increased by 400% to 500% compared to the average efficiency in 1949. For example, the Hegang Mining Bureau improved its labor organization and reduced idle time. Its production efficiency in September increased by 34.2% compared to the first half of the year. Hongshan Coal Mine implemented the "double-cycle" coal mining method, which generally increased the daily advance of the working face from 3.6 meters to 15 meters.
    Due to the extensive and in-depth study of advanced Soviet experience, production efficiency has continuously improved, and labor organization has also been improved accordingly. Various mines have transferred a large number of workers from production to participate in study or to basic construction. In the three regions of Northeast China, North China, and East China alone, tens of thousands of people have left production to participate in various studies, which has prepared a strong force for the country to build new mines and develop new coalfields.

    National railways overfulfilled the 1952 freight tonnage task seven days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 0.7%. The tonnage overfulfilled in 1952 increased by 15.7% compared to the actual tonnage completed in the entire year of 1951.
    Starting in May 1952, the national railways launched the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, and widely promoted a series of advanced experiences such as the Yang Maolin loading method, the Li Xikui shunting method, the Sudenikov dispatching method, and tight operation diagrams, which greatly improved transportation efficiency and cargo loading volume. Compared with the same period in 1951, the average vehicle load in October 1952 increased by 10.9%, train marshalling time was shortened by 14%, vehicle turnaround time was shortened by 3.1%, and locomotive daily car kilometers in November increased by 16.4%.
    In 1952, the national railways also launched work to open up sources of goods and organize freight transportation, which strengthened the connection between railways and cargo owners and promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, which also played a significant role in completing the annual freight tonnage task. The former China Changchun Railway Administration used methods such as holding cargo owner meetings and investigating and mastering sources of goods to actively solicit sources of goods, ensuring that the bureau completed the annual freight tonnage task half a month ahead of schedule.
    In addition, the early completion of the national new vehicle manufacturing task provided sufficient locomotives and vehicles for completing the annual freight transportation task. As of mid-December last year, locomotives had overfulfilled the task by 150%, and vehicles had also overfulfilled the task by 104%. The early completion of new line projects has also created favorable conditions for opening up sources of goods and increasing freight volume.

    Xinhua News Agency: Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, Tan Guangting, Director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, and Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, jointly sent a telegram to congratulate railway workers across the country, calling on them to guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and labor enthusiasm, further promote the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, further study advanced Soviet experience, especially the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway, and strive for greater achievements.

### 全国煤矿、铁路完成去年生产及货运任务

    全国煤矿、铁路完成去年生产及货运任务
    全国国营煤矿一九五二年超额完成生产计划。截止去年十二月底，已完成百分之一○五点四，比一九五一年提高了百分之二八点七。如果加上地方国营、公私合营与私营煤矿的计划产量合计，比一九四九年增加一倍以上。
    在安全方面，由于基本上解决了通风问题和初步解决了顶板管理问题，使矿山的瓦斯爆炸与冒顶事故大为减少，全国煤矿事故的死亡人数初步统计比一九四九年减少了百分之七十五。
    一年来全国煤矿生产效率逐季上升，如以一九四九年为一○○，则一九五二年第一季为一九六，第二季为二一三，第三季为二二七，第四季为二六○。东北、华北很多比较先进矿的生产效率，较一九四九年平均效率已提高了百分之四百至五百。例如鹤岗矿务局改善了劳动组织，减少了窝工现象，九月份生产效率就比上半年提高了百分之三十四点二，洪山煤矿实行“双循环”采煤法，一般日进工作面由三点六公尺提高到十五公尺。
    由于广泛深入的学习了苏联先进经验，生产效率不断提高，劳动组织随之获得改进，各矿曾从生产方面抽调了大批工人参加学习或转到基本建设方面。仅东北、华北、华东三区脱离生产参加各种学习的就有数万人，这就为国家建设新矿山、开采新煤田准备了强大的力量。    （钟    然）
    全国铁路提前七天超额百分之零点七完成了一九五二年货物运输吨数的任务。一九五二年超额完成的吨数比一九五一年全年实际完成的吨数增加了百分之十五点七。
    一九五二年五月开始，全国铁路展开了满载、超轴、五百公里运动，并且普遍地推广了杨茂林装车法、李锡奎调车法、苏德尼果夫调度法、紧密运行图等一系列的先进经验，使运输效率和货物装载量大大提高。与一九五一年同时期比较，一九五二年十月份车辆平均载重提高了百分之十点九，列车编组时间缩短了百分之十四，车辆周转时间缩短了百分之三点一，十一月份机车日车公里提高了百分之十六点四。
    一九五二年全国铁路还开展了开辟货源、组织货运的工作，密切了铁路和货主间的联系，促进了城乡物资交流，这对完成全年货物运输吨数任务也起了很大作用。原中长铁路管理局用召开货主会议，调查和掌握货源等办法，主动招揽货源，保证该局提前半个月完成全年货物运输吨数任务。
    另外，全国新造车任务的提前完成，为完成年度货物运输任务提供了足够的机车和车辆。截至去年十二月中旬，机车已超额完成任务百分之一百五十，车辆也超额完成任务百分之一百零四。新线工程的提前完成，也为开辟货源、增加货运创造了有利条件。
    中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远、铁道部政治部主任谭光廷、中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯联合致电向全国铁路员工祝贺，号召他们戒骄戒躁，继续发扬爱国主义精神和劳动积极性，更深入地开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，进一步学习苏联先进经验特别是中长铁路的先进经验，争取更大的成绩。    （新华社）
