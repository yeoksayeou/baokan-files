    Racial Discrimination and Terror in the United States Escalates Daily
    In Los Angeles, USA, at two o'clock one morning, two policemen broke into the home of a seventy-two-year-old black worker named Scruggs. Because this deaf worker could not hear what the police were saying and failed to follow their orders, he was shot dead on the spot. This was the twelfth incident of police officers shooting black people without cause in less than a year.
    On December 13th of last year, during an air raid drill in New York, a policeman shot and killed a Puerto Rican worker named Flores because he did not immediately obey the policeman's order to enter the bomb shelter.
    Racial discrimination and terror in the United States are escalating daily. This is one of the signs that the United States is moving towards a fascist police state.

    美国种族歧视的恐怖行动与日俱增
    在美国洛杉矶一天早晨两点钟，有两名警察闯入一个七十二岁的黑人工人斯克鲁格斯的家里。这个耳聋的工人听不见警察说什么，未能执行他们的命令，因此就被当场枪毙了。这是不到一年时间所发生的第十二次警察无故枪杀黑人的事件。
    在去年十二月十三日纽约举行防空演习时，一个警察打死了一个波多黎各工人弗洛雷斯，因为他没有立刻执行警察叫他进入避弹室的命令。
    美国的种族歧视的恐怖行动正与日俱增。这是美国走向法西斯警察国家的标志之一。
