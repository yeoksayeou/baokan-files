    "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" is a New Tool for the U.S. to Enslave Japan
    The so-called "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," which the Japanese Yoshida government and the U.S. government began negotiating in February of last year, has recently completed a draft and will soon be ready for signing. According to the draft treaty, Americans will enjoy "national treatment" with the same rights as Japanese citizens in Japan. Americans can freely engage in various commercial activities in Japan, freely open banks, mine mines, buy shares in Japanese companies, remit investment profits back to their home country without restriction, and occupy real estate in Japan. It is very clear that this is a new shackle for the U.S. to enslave Japan, a new tool for U.S. monopoly capitalists to carry out large-scale plunder of Japan, and a new deed of sale for Japan, rather than an equal "Treaty of Commerce and Navigation." After the implementation of this treaty, U.S. monopoly capitalists will further control Japan's industry, trade, and shipping, causing Japan to completely lose its economic autonomy; more cruelly exploit the Japanese people, and make the Japanese people increasingly impoverished.
    Just as the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" is a supplement to the U.S.'s separate "peace treaty" with Japan in military and political terms, the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" is an economic supplement to the U.S.'s separate "peace treaty" with Japan. The separate "peace treaty" with Japan is the main tool for the U.S. to enslave Japan. Using this tool, the U.S. can create all kinds of shackles that harm the Japanese people. As long as this "peace treaty" exists, there will be more "Administrative Agreements" and "Treaties of Commerce and Navigation" appearing one after another. The Japanese people are increasingly aware of this. The implementation of the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" will not only sharpen the contradictions between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese people, but will also promote the contradictions between U.S. monopoly capitalists and the Japanese bourgeoisie. Because this treaty will cause great damage to the Japanese bourgeoisie. Therefore, serious differences of opinion have also arisen within the Yoshida government. According to a Kyodo News Agency report on January 10, when the Yoshida cabinet meeting studied the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," the Ministry of Finance, headed by Mitsui zaibatsu representative Tadaharu Mukai, submitted a written opinion, expressing "difficulty in accepting" six clauses such as Americans being able to freely purchase stocks in Japan and remit profits back to their home country without restriction, and said that these opinions "leave no room for compromise." Kyodo News Agency admitted that "this treaty will affect the Japanese economy for the next ten years," and said that in this treaty, "nationalism has been swept away." Under these obstacles, Yoshida, a loyal lackey of U.S. imperialism, could not help but pretend to bargain with his master for more than a year. But these "cries" from the Japanese bourgeoisie are very weak, and now the reactionary Yoshida government is working hard to "eliminate opposing opinions" in order to formally sign this treaty in the near future. But the Japanese people will never agree, and they will unite more closely to fight against the American occupiers who are trying to step up their enslavement of the Japanese people, and against the reactionary Yoshida clique that is further auctioning off Japan's national sovereignty.

### “美日通商航海条约”是美国奴役日本的新工具

    “美日通商航海条约”是美国奴役日本的新工具
    日本吉田政府和美国政府之间从去年二月开始谈判的所谓“美日通商航海条约”，最近已完成草案，不久就准备签订。根据条约草案的规定，美国人在日本享有和日本人同等权利的“国民待遇”，美国人在日本可以自由从事各种商业活动，任意开办银行，开采矿山，购买日本公司的股票，把投资的利润无限制地汇回本国，并可以在日本占有不动产。事情很明白，这是美国奴役日本的新枷锁，是美国垄断资本家对日本实行大掠夺的新工具，是日本的新卖身契，而不是什么平等的“通商航海条约”。这一条约实行后，美国垄断资本家将更进一步控制日本的工业、贸易和航运，使日本完全丧失经济自主权；更残酷地剥削日本人民，使日本人民日益贫困化。
    正如同美日“行政协定”是美国单独对日“和约”在军事和政治方面的补充一样，“美日通商航海条约”是美国单独对日“和约”在经济方面的补充。单独对日“和约”是美国奴役日本的主要工具，使用这一工具美国可以制造出各种各样危害日本人民的枷锁来。只要这个“和约”还存在，便会有更多的“行政协定”和“通商航海条约”接二连三地出现。这一点，日本人民是越来越看得清楚了。实行“美日通商航海条约”，不仅将使美、日反动派和日本人民之间的矛盾更加尖锐化，而且也将促进美国垄断资本家和日本资产阶级之间的矛盾。因为这个条约将给日本资产阶级带来很大的损害。因此，在吉田政府内部，也引起严重的意见分歧。据一月十日共同社消息，吉田内阁会议研究“美日通商航海条约”时，以三井财阀代表向井忠晴为首的大藏省提出书面意见，对美国人在日本可以随便购买股票，无限制地把利润汇返本国等六项条款表示“难予承认”，并说这些意见“已经是毫无妥协的余地”。共同社承认，“这个条约将影响以后十年的日本经济”，并说，在这个条约里，“民族主义色彩是一扫而空了”。在这些阻力下面，使美帝国主义的忠实走狗吉田也不能不装腔作势地和他的主子进行了一年多的讨价还价。但是日本资产阶级的这些“呼声”是非常微弱的，现在吉田反动政府正在努力“消除对立的意见”，以便于最近期间正式签订这个条约了。但是日本人民决不会答应，他们必将更紧密地团结起来，和企图加紧奴役日本人民的美国占领者作斗争，和正在进一步拍卖日本民族主权的吉田反动集团作斗争。
