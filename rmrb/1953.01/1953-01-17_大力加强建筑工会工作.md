    A key to thoroughly reforming the old construction industry lies in strengthening leadership in this sector from all aspects. Only in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm of workers and technicians to complete the current and future construction tasks. This is the policy put forward by the First National Construction Union Work Conference in 1951. For more than a year, the Party committees and trade unions in some regions have not paid enough attention to this policy, resulting in the construction union organizations in many regions remaining very weak to this day.
    The construction industry is one of the most important undertakings during the national construction period and an important link in national industrialization. However, due to the backward handicraft production methods of the construction industry, the guild and factional ideas among construction workers are very serious. In addition, the seasonal, dispersed, and mobile nature of construction workers' work means they do not have many opportunities for organization and education. Therefore, construction workers are generally relatively backward. How to solve this problem? The only way is to educate construction workers, raise their class consciousness, and gradually organize them. This is the responsibility of the construction union. However, if the Party committee does not strengthen its leadership over the construction union and does not send capable cadres and outstanding Communist Party members to participate in the work of the construction union, the construction union will not be able to complete this task alone. Facts have proved that the construction unions in Northeast and North China, under the leadership of the Party, have strengthened organizational and educational work. Therefore, they not only ensured the completion of last year's project tasks but also trained cadres and improved the political awareness and technical level of construction workers, creating favorable conditions for larger-scale construction in the future.
    The Party committees in East China, Central South, and Northwest China did not fully follow this policy and did not strengthen the work of the construction union in a timely manner. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they also failed to seize the opportunity to establish and improve the organizations of construction unions. Until last November, when the slogan "Give priority to capital construction" was clearly put forward, the Party committees in these regions still did not pay attention, making the construction unions weak and powerless in the face of new tasks. The reason for this situation can only be explained by the fact that the Party committees in these regions did not give due attention to the work of trade unions in capital construction. The National Construction Union Work Committee has not thoroughly inspected the work in these regions in the past year or so and has not corrected shortcomings and errors in a timely manner. Therefore, it must also bear some responsibility for the current situation.
    Currently, construction departments in various places are carrying out winter training and other preparatory work. This is a tense period. If the preparatory work is not done well, the entire year's capital construction work will face great difficulties. The Party committees in East China, Central South, and Northwest China should immediately seize the opportunity to vigorously lead the winter training work and actively cultivate and train cadres. As long as there are cadres and a worker contingent armed with advanced ideology and technology, and based on the size of the capital construction tasks and the concentration of construction workers, the construction unions in some places should be established and improved first, with emphasis. In this way, the past situation can be gradually changed, the strength of construction work can be strengthened, and the main and urgent tasks for 1953 can be completed. The National Construction Union Work Committee should also conduct more inspections, put forward policies and methods, and urge this work to be accelerated.

### 大力加强建筑工会工作

    大力加强建筑工会工作
    彻底改革旧建筑业的关键，在于从各方面加强对这个部门的领导。这样，才能发动工人和技术人员的积极性，完成目前和将来的建设任务。这是一九五一年第一次全国建筑工会工作会议所提出来的方针。一年多以来，有些地区的党委和工会对这个方针没有重视，致使许多地区的建筑工会组织至今依然十分薄弱。
    建筑工业是国家建设时期最重要的事业之一，是国家工业化的重要环节。但是，由于建筑工业落后的手工业的生产方式，建筑工人中的行会、帮派思想很严重；加上建筑工人工作的季节性，分散性和流动性较大，受组织和教育的机会不多，所以，建筑工人一般是比较落后的。怎样解决这个问题呢？唯一的办法，就是要在建筑工人中进行教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟，把他们逐步组织起来。这是建筑工会的责任。但是，如果党委不加强对建筑工会的领导，不派得力的干部和优秀的共产党员参加建筑工会的工作，建筑工会也是没法单独来完成这个任务的。事实证明：东北和华北的建筑工会在党的领导下，加强了组织和教育工作。因此，不仅保证了去年工程任务的完成，而且培养了干部，提高了建筑工人的政治觉悟和技术水平，为今后更大规模的建设创造了有利的条件。
    华东、中南和西北的党委没有完全按着这个方针进行，没有适时加强建筑工会工作。在“三反”“五反”运动中，他们也没有抓紧时机建立和健全建筑工会的组织。直到去年十一月，“把基本建设放在首要地位”的口号已被明确地提出来了，这些地区的党委还是不加重视，致使建筑工会在新的任务面前软弱无力。产生这种情况的原因，除了这些地区的党委对基本建设中工会工作没有予以应有的重视以外，是不能用任何理由来解释的。全国建筑工会工作委员会在这一年多以来，没有深入检查这些地区的工作，并及时纠正缺点和错误，因此，对目前的情况也是要负一些责任的。
    目前，各地建筑部门都在进行冬训和其他的准备工作。这是一个紧张的时期。准备工作搞不好，全年的基本建设工作就会发生极大的困难。华东、中南和西北等地的党委，应立即抓住时机，大力领导冬训工作，积极培养和训练干部。只要干部有了，又有了被先进思想和先进技术武装了的工人队伍，再根据基本建设任务的大小、建筑工人集中的多少，有重点地把一些地方的建筑工会首先建立和健全起来。这样，就可以逐渐改变过去的情况，加强建筑工作的力量，完成一九五三年度的主要的和紧急的任务。全国建筑工会工作委员会也应该多加检查，提出方针和办法，督促这一工作加速进行。
