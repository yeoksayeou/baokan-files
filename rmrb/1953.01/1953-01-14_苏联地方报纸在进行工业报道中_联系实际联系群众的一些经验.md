Some Experiences of Soviet Local Newspapers in Industrial Reporting, Connecting with Reality and the Masses
Bao Ding, Jiang Hong

II. Competition Among Regional Newspapers

The newspapers of Omsk Oblast and Novosibirsk Oblast, in another way, extensively connected with the working masses of the two oblasts, coordinated the development of the production competition of the working masses of the two oblasts, and enabled the advanced experience in production to be exchanged between the two oblasts.

In the second year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the laborers of the above two oblasts launched a socialist competition to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

A competition was also launched between the two regional newspapers, "Omsk Pravda" and "Soviet Siberia." The conditions of their competition were: to systematically report on the process of socialist labor competition, to publish articles by advanced workers and their achievements, and to exchange the experiences of Stakhanovite workers in industry and agriculture in the newspapers.

"Omsk Pravda" first organized a meeting in the editorial department between Comrade Sakharov, a famous Novosibirsk lathe operator, and lathe operators in the Omsk industrial sector. Comrade Sakharov's report on his working methods and the speeches of the participants at this meeting were published in the newspaper. At the same time, the editorial department conducted extensive coverage of the competition between individual workers and technicians and between regions in Omsk and Novosibirsk. A special column entitled "Novosibirsk People, Please Accept the Call of the Omsk People" was published simultaneously in the two newspapers. "Soviet Siberia," in response to this call, also published its own column: "Novosibirsk People Respond to the Call of the Omsk People."

Due to the extensive publicity of the socialist competition, the interest of the workers in communications grew. Letters and articles on competition issues were constantly sent to the editorial departments of the two newspapers. Effective competition was carried out between technicians Comrades Telenburg and Leutov, between lathe operators Comrades Jie Lieping and Sakharov, between work teams Comrades Minshkot and Chekachiv, between locomotive depot workers Comrades Stanbanov and Gaoliuk, and between many other Stakhanovite workers in the two oblasts.

The combatant and effective competition promoted the close friendship between the workers of Omsk and Novosibirsk Oblasts and prompted them to exchange experiences frequently. Experts from Omsk enterprises provided their articles to "Soviet Siberia" through "Omsk Pravda." Comrade Harin, one of the engineers of the Omsk factory and director of a rationalization and invention bureau, in his letter published in "Soviet Siberia," told how the rationalization workers in Omsk were fighting to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and told about the experience of organizing collective work groups of rationalization workers. "Soviet Siberia" also organized many such materials to supply "Omsk Pravda."

What good things did the workers of the two oblasts learn from each other? For example, the Omsk people learned from the experience of the Novosibirsk people and implemented the method of establishing worker registered accounts in their own enterprises; the Novosibirsk people accepted the experience of organizing collective work groups of rationalization workers in Omsk enterprises; applied the method of establishing personal work plans for workshops initiated by the old technician Comrade Maksimov, implemented the method of formulating daily income and expenditure balance sheets, and so on. The vast working masses of the two oblasts were concerned about the progress of the socialist competition. The workers' aspirations to strive for victory in the competition were reflected in the "decisions," "oaths" and all other documents that appeared in factories, collective farms and state farms. People paid close attention to everything new, carefully studied and learned advanced experiences, and turned these experiences into the property of the workers of their own oblast.

III. Labor Echo

The industrial products of Vladimir Oblast are scattered in every corner of the Soviet Union. A large number of tractors, excavators, textile machines and other machines are transported to the Central Asian republics. Based on this situation, the editorial department of "Call Newspaper" organized Vladimir workers and cotton planting workers in the republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan to carry out labor echo. The journalists of Vladimir Oblast made requests to the editorial departments of "Truth of the East," "Turkmen Spark," and "Tajik Communist," asking them to report on the agricultural workers of the republics' reflections on the quality of tractors manufactured by Vladimir factories. The editorial departments of these newspapers enthusiastically responded to this request and provided a lot of material.

"Call Newspaper" published a special column entitled "Friends, we are talking to you!" under the masthead of "'Turkmen Spark' in Vladimir." The mechanical workers and cotton planters of Turkmenistan gave high praise to the tractors of Vladimir. An old mechanical worker of a cotton planting tractor station, Pobe Yinghev, wrote: "What a good machine this is." Tractor worker Bede Kelmarmandov said: "Comrade workers of Vladimir, please manufacture more such machines." But they also pointed out many shortcomings of the tractors and raised important questions to the Vladimir workers. The mechanical workers pointed out: "We hope that the tillage tractor with the trademark of 'Vladimir Tractor Factory' will become a machine that is impeccable in all aspects."

These communications published in the regional newspaper received a lively response from the tractor manufacturers in Vladimir Oblast. The suggestions and hopes of those cotton planters were discussed at workers' meetings. The director of the tractor factory issued a special instruction on how to implement the suggestions of the Turkmen laborers.

Soon, the exchange page column of "Call Newspaper" appeared in "Turkmen Spark." In this column, the director, the chief designer of the Vladimir Tractor Factory, the chief engineer, the director of the technical management department, Stakhanovite workers, craftsmen, and work team leaders reported their work plans to the cotton planters and mechanical workers of Turkmenistan.

When the cotton harvest season was approaching in the Central Asian republics, "Call Newspaper" published an open letter from the workers of the cotton textile industry department of Vladimir Province to the cotton planters of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. The textile workers of Vladimir called on them to successfully complete the cotton picking work, improve the quality of cotton, and deliver it to the state early. The cotton planters immediately responded to the call of the Vladimir textile workers with facts. In the Vladimir newspaper appeared a new exchange page column of "Turkmen Spark," and its title was: "Vladimir textile workers! Your call will definitely be fulfilled. Your dear Turkmen cotton planters will guarantee to provide your factory with high-quality cotton." (End of this section, to be continued)

    苏联地方报纸在进行工业报道中 联系实际联系群众的一些经验
    鲍碇　江虹
    二、州报之间的竞赛
    鄂木斯克州和诺沃西比尔斯克州两个州报以另一种方式，广泛地联系两州的劳动群众，配合了两州劳动群众生产竞赛的开展，使生产中的先进经验在两个州之间互相交流。
    在战后五年计划的第二年，上述两州的劳动者为提前完成战后五年计划掀起了社会主义竞赛。在
    “鄂木斯克真理报”和“苏维埃西伯利亚报”两州报之间也展开了竞赛。他们的竞赛条件是：有系统地报道社会主义劳动竞赛的过程，登载先进者的文章和他们的成绩，在报纸上交换工业和农业的斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验。
    “鄂木斯克真理报”首先在编辑部组织著名的诺沃西比尔斯克镟工萨哈尔夫同志和鄂木斯克工业部门中的镟工的会面。萨哈尔夫同志关于他的工作方法的报告和在这个见面会上与会者的讲话，都在报上发表了。编辑部同时进行了广泛的关于鄂木斯克和诺沃西比尔斯克个别工人和技师之间和地区之间竞赛的报道。题名为“诺沃西比尔斯克人请接受鄂木斯克人的号召”的专栏同时在两个报上刊出了。“苏维埃西伯利亚报”为了回答这个号召起见，还出版了自己的专栏：“诺沃西比尔斯克人响应鄂木斯克人的号召”。
    由于广泛地宣传了社会主义竞赛，使得劳动者对于通讯的兴趣日益增长。关于竞赛问题的信件和通讯稿不断地投到这两个报的编辑部去。有效的竞赛在技师特伦堡同志和莱乌托夫同志之间，在镟工介列平同志和萨哈洛夫同志之间，在工作队明施高特同志和契卡乞夫同志之间，在机车场工人斯丹巴诺夫同志和高柳克同志之间以及在两州的其它许多斯塔哈诺夫工作者之间进行着。
    战斗的、有效的竞赛促进了鄂木斯克和诺沃西比尔斯克两州工人间密切的友谊的联系，并促使他们经常交换经验。鄂木斯克企业里的专家们通过“鄂木斯克真理报”向“苏维埃西伯利亚报”供给自己的文章。一个合理化与发明局局长——鄂木斯克工厂工程师之一哈林同志，在他的发表在“苏维埃西伯利亚报”上的信中，讲述了鄂木斯克合理化工作者怎样为提前完成五年计划而斗争，讲述了组织合理化工作者集体工作组的经验。“苏维埃西伯利亚报”方面也组织了许多这样的材料供给“鄂木斯克真理报”。
    这两个州的劳动者相互之间学会了什么好的东西呢？举例来说，鄂木斯克人学习诺沃西比尔斯克人的经验，在自己的企业中实行了订立工人记名帐的办法；诺沃西比尔斯克人接受了鄂木斯克企业中组织合理化工作者集体工作组的经验；应用了老技工马克西姆夫同志所倡议的订立工场个人工作计划的方法，实行了制订每天收支对照表的办法以及其他等等。两个州的广大劳动群众关心着社会主义竞赛的进展。劳动者在竞赛中争取优胜的志愿，反映在“决定”“誓言”和其他一切在工厂、集体农庄和国营农场里出现的文件中。人们注意地关心着一切新事物，仔细研究和学习先进经验，并把这些经验变成本州劳动者的财产。
    三、劳动的呼应
    弗拉吉米尔州的工业生产品，散布在苏联的每个角落里。大量的拖拉机、开凿机、纺织机以及其它机器运往中亚细亚各共和国。“号召报”编辑部根据这一情况，组织弗拉吉米尔的工人和乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克各共和国的植棉工人一起进行劳动的呼应。弗拉吉米尔州的新闻工作者向“东方真理报”、“土库曼火星报”和“塔吉克共产党人报”编辑部提出了要求，请他们报告关于各共和国农业工作者对弗拉吉米尔工厂制造的拖拉机质量的反映。这些报纸编辑部热情地响应了这个要求，并提供了许多材料。
    “号召报”以“‘土库曼火星报’在弗拉吉米尔”作报头，发表了以“朋友们，我们向你们讲话！”为题的专栏。土库曼的机械工人和植棉工人对弗拉吉米尔的拖拉机给予很高的评价，一个植棉拖拉机站的老机械工人波贝日英夫写道：“这是多么好的机器。”拖拉机工人贝德·柯尔玛曼多夫说：“弗拉吉米尔工人同志们，请更多地制造这样的机器。”但是他们也指出了拖拉机的许多缺点，并向弗拉吉米尔工人提出了重要的问题。机械工人们指出：“我们愿望以‘弗拉吉米尔拖拉机工厂’为商标的耕作拖拉机成为各方面都无缺点的机器。”
    发表在州报上的这些通讯，获得了弗拉吉米尔州拖拉机制造人员生动的响应。那些植棉工人的建议和希望在工人会议上讨论着。拖拉机工厂的厂长发布了专门的关于实现土库曼劳动者建议之方法的指令。
    很快地，“号召报”的交换之页专栏在“土库曼火星报”上出现了。在这个专栏上，厂长、弗拉吉米尔的拖拉机工厂总设计师、总技师、技术管理部主任、斯塔哈诺夫工作者以及工匠、工作队队长们，向土库曼的植棉工人和机械工人们报告自己的工作计划。
    当中亚细亚各共和国快到棉花收获季节的时候，“号召报”发表了弗拉吉米尔省棉织工业部门工人给乌兹别克、塔吉克以及土库曼植棉工人的公开信。弗拉吉米尔的纺织工人号召他们胜利完成采棉工作，提高棉花的质量，提早向国家交货。植棉工人们即以事实回答弗拉吉米尔纺织工作人员的号召。在弗拉吉米尔的报纸上出现了“土库曼火星报”的新的交换之页专栏，它的标题是这样的：“弗拉吉米尔纺织工人们！你们的号召一定能够完成。你们的亲爱的土库曼的植棉工人，将保证给你们的工厂以高等质量的棉花。”（本节完，全文未完）
