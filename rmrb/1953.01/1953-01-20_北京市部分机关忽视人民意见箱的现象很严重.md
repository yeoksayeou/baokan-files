Beijing Municipal Agencies Seriously Neglect People's Suggestion Boxes

By our reporter Xi Ping

Recently, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, and other relevant agencies, under the direction of Comrade Peng Zhen, organized several groups to conduct a spot check of the people's suggestion boxes throughout Beijing. I, the reporter, also participated in this inspection. A total of one hundred and sixty suggestion boxes were inspected, of which only forty-nine had people genuinely responsible for them and were regularly opened and checked. The remaining one hundred and eleven were regularly left unattended and unchecked, and were forgotten. The various opinions submitted by the people into these suggestion boxes were left there for a long time, unattended. Some letters were put into the boxes in March of last year, and now the letters are moldy, and the handwriting is illegible.

A staff member of the Municipal Public Security Bureau named Pan Yongzeng said when introducing us to the Qianmen Public Security Branch for inspection: "Now each of our police stations has a suggestion box, and we can guarantee that the suggestion boxes are regularly opened and checked, and there is no backlog of letters." I was very convinced by Comrade Pan's words. As soon as I arrived at the Qianmen Branch, I asked the secretary, Zhang Naizhi, to tell me the total number and locations of the suggestion boxes belonging to the branch's police stations. However, things were completely unexpected. Zhang Naizhi said: "I only know that there is a suggestion box at the entrance of the branch." He seemed a little uneasy about our visit. He said: "Would you like to go to other districts to take a look first?" We disagreed with his suggestion and repeatedly asked for his assistance. He finally inquired from the district people's government and found out that there were a total of eight suggestion boxes in the district and told us the locations (after the inspection, the Qianmen District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Beijing, reported to the higher authorities that there were twenty-nine boxes). We started the inspection from the suggestion box at the entrance of the Qianmen Branch. When the box was opened, we only saw a pile of paper shrinking in the black ash. When we pushed away the mud with our hands, we found two letters. The letter paper was corroded by rain, and some parts were stuck together, and the handwriting was sometimes illegible. The names of the informants and the year and month the letters were written were also incomplete. The content of the letters was to report local bullies and hooligans. Zhang Naizhi frankly admitted that this box had not been opened for half a year. When we went to the Xuejiawan Police Station in Qianmen District to investigate, the internal household registration police officer of the police station, Xu Shilan, first showed us a ballot box placed on the office cabinet. She said: "Is this the box?" Judging from the color and style of the box, it did not look like a people's suggestion box. So we asked her to find another one. She said that she had been working at this police station for less than three months and had not seen any suggestion boxes. We asked her to ask other comrades. She called the external affairs officer, Wang Huaqing. Wang Huaqing told Xu Shilan on the phone that the suggestion box was hanging on the outside wall. However, when Xu Shilan led us to open the box, there was only a nail on the wall, and there was no sign of the box. "When was the box lost?" Even Xu Shilan and Wang Huaqing could not answer this question. Xu Shilan said: "The box may be lost, or it may be this ballot box." The suggestion box of the Qianmen District People's Government has also been left unattended. Later, a staff member named Qiao Juqing simply took the lock off the box and locked his office door.

The people's suggestion boxes have been left unopened for a long time, stifling many voices, criticisms, and suggestions from the masses. During this spot check, a total of ninety-six backlogged letters were found. Some of these letters expressed the masses' enthusiastic support for the various policies of the People's Government, some raised their own pressing difficulties and requested the government to help solve them, and some reported the "five poisons" behavior of unscrupulous merchants and local bullies, landlords, and counter-revolutionaries. There were also letters from the masses who sharply criticized the government for failing to handle their letters in a timely manner. In the suggestion box set up at the Yamenkou Police Station in Shijingshan, there were two letters: one letter reported a counter-revolutionary element, which the police station estimated had been in the box for more than a month. The second letter was from the original informant expressing dissatisfaction with the failure to process his letter. The letter said: "Why do the comrades of the Public Security Bureau ignore it? ... Aren't your local public security (personnel) the defenders of the people's interests? ... Don't be too bureaucratic! Is there any personal affection here?" These two letters were taken out by the police station itself four days before this spot check of the suggestion box. According to the police station, after they took out these two letters, they investigated the matter among the masses. However, because the days had been long, the person who was reported was no longer at the original address, and it was difficult to make a satisfactory disposition. Before this spot check, some cadres had said: the masses are not used to using suggestion boxes, suggestion boxes are not useful, and therefore it is not worth checking. These comrades should take a look at the criticism in the previous letter, how much enthusiasm and hope the masses have for the people's suggestion boxes! And bureaucracy has stifled this precious enthusiasm and hope of the masses!

The main reason for the above serious neglect of the work of the people's suggestion boxes is that the Beijing Municipal People's Government has not seriously and responsibly led this work. In the past year or so, the government agencies at all levels in Beijing have made great progress and achievements in handling the people's letters, and have also been well received by the masses. But now it seems that they only paid attention to the letters from the masses that were directly mailed to the government or the letters from the masses that were forwarded by the higher authorities, and they did not pay enough attention to the letters in the suggestion boxes. On August 19 last year, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on strengthening the people's supervisory correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms, which pointed out: "In coordination with the development of the people's supervisory correspondents, people's suggestion boxes should be set up in a planned way and managed by the people's supervisory correspondents. The people's suggestion boxes must be opened and checked regularly every day and handled quickly to avoid accumulating the opinions of the people." Although the Beijing Municipal People's Government discussed this instruction at the Municipal Government Administrative Meeting and decided to hand over the suggestion boxes set up by the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee during the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements to the People's Supervisory Committee, the People's Procuratorate, and the Public Security Bureau for management, and if it was not enough, they could be added, many units believed that the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements were over, and the suggestion boxes were not needed at all. They regarded listening to the people's opinions as a temporary task. Among the more than one hundred suggestion boxes inspected this time, only more than ten were managed by the people's supervisory correspondents. The Municipal Government did not promptly check and correct the above situation.

In order to correct this serious situation, at the 144th Administrative Meeting of the Beijing Municipal Government on January 16, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu focused on reviewing the shortcomings of the Municipal Government's leadership in this work, and proposed to commend those who have done well based on the inspection results, criticize those who have done poorly, quickly handle the delayed letters, and apologize to the letter writers. At the same time, the meeting also made a decision on the addition and management of suggestion boxes: each agency should set up suggestion boxes internally to solicit the opinions of staff members. The people's suggestion boxes on the streets should be set up uniformly in each district by the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee and managed by a person specially responsible for the Supervisory Committee. The suggestion boxes of the Procuratorate and the Public Security Bureau system should be retained, and the Municipal People's Court should set up a people's suggestion box in front of the court. Whether it is necessary for other agencies to set up additional suggestion boxes should be studied immediately. The meeting also instructed the Municipal Supervisory Committee and the Municipal Government Secretariat to regularly check and supervise the work of each agency in handling the people's letters and managing the people's suggestion boxes.

    北京市部分机关忽视人民意见箱的现象很严重
    本报记者  习平
    最近，北京市人民政府、北京市人民监察委员会及其他有关机关，在彭真同志指示下，组织若干小组，对北京市各处的人民意见箱作了一次抽查。记者也参加了这次检查。被抽查的意见箱共有一百六十个，其中只有四十九个意见箱有人切实负责，经常开检。其余一百一十一个，则经常无人负责开检，被遗忘了。人民群众投入这些意见箱中的各种意见，被长期搁置在那里，无人理睬。有的信是去年三月份投入箱里的，现在信已霉烂，字迹也看不清了。
    市公安局一个名叫潘永增的工作人员在介绍我们去前门公安分局抽查时说：“现在我们每个派出所都有一个意见箱，意见箱能做到经常开检，积压信件的事现在可以保证是没有了。”我很相信潘同志的话，一到前门分局，就请秘书张乃之把分局所属各派出所意见箱的总数和地点告诉我。可是事情完全出乎意外。张乃之说：“我只知道分局门口有一个意见箱。”他对我们的来访似乎有些不安。他说：“你是不是先到别的区去看看？”我们不同意他的建议，一再请他协助，他才从区人民政府打听出全区共有八个意见箱，并告诉了设置的地点（检查以后，中共北京市前门区委员会向上级报告的数字是二十九个箱）。我们从前门分局门口的意见箱开始检查。箱子一打开，只见一团纸头缩在黑灰里。用手拨开灰泥，才发现是两封信。信纸因被雨水浸蚀，有的地方已沾连在一起，字迹有的已分辨不清。检举人的姓名和写信的年月也已残缺不全。信的内容是检举恶霸和流氓。张乃之坦白承认这个箱子有半年没有开了。我们到前门区薛家湾派出所调查的时候，派出所的内勤户籍警徐世兰先把放在办公室橱子上的一个票箱给我们看。她说：“是不是这只箱子？”从箱子的颜色和式样看，不像是人民意见箱。我们就请她另外找一找。她说，她到这个派出所工作还不到三个月，没有看到过什么意见箱。我们请她问一问别的同志。她就打电话问外勤干事王华清。王华清在电话里告诉徐世兰说，意见箱挂在门外墙上。可是当徐世兰领着我们去开箱子的时候，墙上只有一只钉子，连箱子的影子也没有。“箱子到底是在什么时候丢掉的呢？”这个问题连徐世兰、王华清也答不出来。徐世兰说：“箱子可能是丢了，也可能就是这只票箱。”前门区人民政府的意见箱，也是一直没人过问。后来一个名叫乔巨卿的工作人员干脆把箱子上的锁拿下来锁了他的办公室大门。
    人民意见箱长久无人开检，窒息了许多来自群众的呼声、批评和建议。在这次抽查中，一共查出积压信件有九十六封。这些来信有的是群众对人民政府各种政策表示热情拥护的，有的是提出自己切身的困难要求政府帮助解决的，有的是检举奸商“五毒”行为和恶霸地主、反革命分子的。还有的来信，是群众对政府不能及时处理他们的来信提出尖锐批评的。在石景山衙门口派出所设立的意见箱里有两封来信：一封信是检举一个反革命分子，这封信据派出所估计，大概在箱内放了有一个多月。第二封信，是原检举人对不处理他的信件表示不满。信中说：“为什么公安局同志置之不理呢？……难道你们地方公安（人员）不是人民利益的保卫者？……不要太官僚啦！是不是这里有私人感情？”这两封信是这次抽查意见箱以前四天由派出所自己拿出的。据派出所说，他们拿出这两封信后，曾在群众中调查此事。但因日子久了，被检举的人已经不在原址了，很难再作出令人满意的处理。此次抽查以前，有的干部曾说：群众还不习惯用意见箱，意见箱没有什么用处，因而不值得检查。这些同志应该看一看前一封信中的批评，群众对待人民意见箱是抱着多大的热情和希望！而官僚主义却扼杀了群众这种可贵的热情和希望！
    造成以上严重忽视人民意见箱工作的原因，主要是北京市人民政府对这一工作没有认真负责地进行领导。一年多来，北京市各级政府机关在处理人民来信工作上有很大的进步和成绩，亦曾得到群众的好评。但现在看来，只是注意了群众直接邮寄到政府里来的信或上级转来的群众信件，对于意见箱中的信件则注意得十分不够。去年八月十九日，中央人民政府政务院颁布的关于加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的指示中曾指出：“配合人民监察通讯员的发展，有计划地设置人民意见箱，由人民监察通讯员掌管。人民意见箱必须每日定时开检，迅速处理，以免积压人民群众的意见。”北京市人民政府虽然对这个指示在市府行政会议上作了讨论，并决定将市节约检查委员会在“三反”“五反”运动期间设置的意见箱交由人民监察委员会、人民检察署、公安局分别管理，如不敷用可以增设，但不少的单位却认为“三反”“五反”运动结束了，意见箱根本不需要了。他们把听取人民意见当作临时任务。在这次抽查的一百多个意见箱中，仅仅有十多个意见箱是人民监察通讯员掌管的。市府对上述情况也没有及时检查纠正。
    为了纠正这个严重情况，一月十六日北京市府第一百四十四次行政会议上，张友渔副市长着重检讨了市府领导上对这一工作的缺点，并提出要根据检查结果，对做得好的进行表扬，对坏的进行批评，对拖延下来的信件作迅速处理，并向来信人道歉。同时，会议对意见箱增设和管理也作了决定：各机关应在内部设置意见箱，征求工作人员的意见。街头的人民意见箱由市人民监察委员会统一在各区设置，由监察委员会专人负责管理。检察署和公安局系统的意见箱仍然保留，市人民法院应在该院门前设置人民意见箱。其他机关有无必要另行设置，应立即加以研究。会议并责成市监察委员会和市府秘书厅定期检查和督促各机关处理人民来信和人民意见箱的管理工作。
