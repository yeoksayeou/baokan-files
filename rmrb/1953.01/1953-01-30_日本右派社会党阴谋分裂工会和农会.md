The labor-traitor elements of the Japanese right-wing Socialist Party have recently intensified their divisive activities against Japan's largest trade union federation, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo). Right-wing socialists controlling the National Federation of Textile Industry Workers' Unions, the All-Japan Seamen's Union, the Japan Broadcasting Labor Union, and the National Cinema and Theater Workers' Union jointly issued a statement at the end of 1952, wantonly attacking the leadership policy of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, advocating the "reorganization of the General Council." On January 11th of this year, they openly prepared to organize the so-called "National Democratic Labor Movement Liaison Council" to engage in activities against the General Council. At the same time, the leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party are undermining Japan's peasant movement. On January 21st, they established the so-called "Farmers' Association General Alliance," with war criminals such as Rikizo Hirano participating, to counter the left wing of the Japan Farmers' Association. All these activities are being carried out at the instigation of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. When the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries cannot suppress the democratic movement of the Japanese people, which is mainly composed of Japanese workers and peasants, from the outside, they are increasingly trying to undermine the unity of the Japanese people from the inside. The splittists of the right-wing Socialist Party are playing the role of lackeys of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in this shameful collusion. It is known that at the "Asian Socialist Party Conference" held not long ago, some leaders of the Japanese right-wing Socialist Party sang the tune of cooperating with Western European right-wing socialist parties, exposing their reactionary face of supporting imperialist war policies and colonial policies. Now, the actual activities of the leaders of the Japanese right-wing Socialist Party in undermining the unity of the people further prove this point.

The splittists of the Japanese right-wing Socialist Party are also carrying out despicable deceptive activities against the Japanese people. They have wildly attacked the headquarters of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan for being "indulged in political struggle," in an attempt to weaken the fighting spirit of the Japanese people against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people know very well that in order to improve their lives and circumstances, they must unite and wage a strong struggle against the American occupiers and the Yoshida reactionary clique, because the evil rule of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is the root cause of the Japanese people's disaster today. The "theory" of the right-wing Socialist Party that Japanese trade unions should not engage in political struggle has long been bankrupt in the eyes of the Japanese people.

Similarly, the "Farmers' Association General Alliance" organized by the splittists of the right-wing Socialist Party and war criminals such as Rikizo Hirano is also a deception. In the program of this "Farmers' Association General Alliance," they hypocritically want to "formulate countermeasures" for the second and third sons in rural areas who have no property inheritance rights, and advocate formulating plans to increase food production. It seems that they are thinking about the peasants, but the fact is that they not only want to organize the second and third sons in rural areas into so-called "industrial development youth teams" and drive them to serve as American cannon fodder, but also want to serve Yoshida's government's food production increase plan for war preparedness and intensify the exploitation of peasants.

These conspiratorial activities of the splittists of the right-wing Socialist Party cannot but arouse the vigilance and opposition of the Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on January 13, denouncing the rebellious behavior of the National Federation of Textile Industry Workers' Unions and other four trade unions. The left-wing Socialist Party and many trade unions have expressed their intention to strengthen unity and defeat the divisive activities of the labor-traitor elements. The second meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the Japan Farmers' Association, held in December 1952, discussed the issue of the united front of farmers and particularly emphasized that farmers should unite with workers to fight. All these are in line with the demands of the broad masses of the Japanese people. As long as the Japanese people unite closely and converge into a torrent under the general goal of striving for independence, democracy, and peace, any countercurrent of divisive activities can be repelled.

### 日本右派社会党阴谋分裂工会和农会

    日本右派社会党阴谋分裂工会和农会
    日本右派社会党的工贼分子，近来正对日本最大的工会联合会——日本工会总评议会加紧进行分裂活动。控制着全国纤维产业工会同盟、全日本海员工会、日本广播工会和全国电影戏剧工会的右派社会党人，于一九五二年底联合发表了一个声明，滥肆攻击日本工会总评议会的领导方针，主张“重组总评议会”。今年一月十一日他们并公开准备组织所谓“全国民主主义劳工运动联络协议会”，从事反对总评议会的活动。与此同时，右派社会党的首领们正在破坏日本的农民运动。他们在一月二十一日成立了有平野力三等战犯参加的所谓“农民组合总同盟”，以与日本农民协会的左派相对抗。所有这些活动，都是在美、日反动派的唆使下进行的。当美、日反动派从外部无法镇压以日本工人和农民为主体的日本人民的民主运动时，他们就越来越处心积虑地想从内部来破坏日本人民的团结。右派社会党的分裂分子，正是在这种可耻的勾当中，充当了美、日反动派的奴才。人们知道，在不久以前召开的“亚洲社会党会议”上，日本右派社会党的某些首领们曾高唱和西欧右翼社会党合作的论调，暴露了他们支持帝国主义战争政策和殖民政策的反动面目。现在日本右派社会党首领们破坏人民团结的实际活动，更加证明了这一点。
    日本右派社会党的分裂分子并对日本人民进行卑鄙的欺骗活动。他们大肆攻击日本工会总评议会的总部“耽迷于政治斗争”，企图以此来削弱日本人民反对美、日反动派的斗志。但是日本广大人民都深深知道，要改善自己的生活和处境，就必须团结起来向美国占领者和吉田反动集团进行坚强斗争，因为美、日反动派的罪恶统治乃是日本人民今日灾难的总根源。右派社会党主张日本工会不应当进行政治斗争的“理论”，在日本人民面前是早已破产了的。
    同样地，右派社会党的分裂分子和平野力三等战犯所组织的“农民组合总同盟”也是一个骗局。他们在这个“农民组合总同盟”的纲领中，假仁假义地要为农村中没有财产继承权的次子和三子“制订对策”，并主张制订增加粮食生产的计划。看来他们似乎在为农民着想，但事实是，他们不但要把农村中的次子和三子组成所谓“产业开发青年队”，驱使他们充当美国炮灰，而且还要为吉田政府的备战的粮食增产计划效劳，加紧剥削农民。
    右派社会党的分裂分子的这些阴谋活动，不能不引起日本人民的警惕和反对。日本共产党在一月十三日曾发表声明，斥责了全国纤维产业工会同盟等四个工会的叛变行为。左派社会党及许多工会都纷纷表示要加强团结，击败工贼分子的分裂活动。一九五二年十二月召开的日本农民协会中央常任委员会第二次会议，讨论了农民统一战线问题，并特别强调农民要和工人联合进行斗争。所有这些都是符合广大日本人民的要求的。只要日本人民紧密地团结起来，在争取独立、民主与和平的总目标下汇成
    一支巨流，任何分裂活动的逆流都是可以打退的。
