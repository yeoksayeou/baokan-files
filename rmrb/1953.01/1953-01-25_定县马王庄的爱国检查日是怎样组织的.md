    How the Patriotic Inspection Day is Organized in Ma Wangzhuang, Ding County
    Ge Shuhua
    Ma Wangzhuang Village, Ninth District, Ding County, Hebei Province, is a village with remarkable achievements in implementing the patriotic inspection day system. Their patriotic inspection day was established on the basis of mass current affairs and policy learning organizations. In the winter of 1951, because some elderly people in the village who had not attended civil schools asked village cadres to regularly explain current affairs to them, the village established a "Political Class" for them, with classes held every three days. Elderly people and young and middle-aged men and women who had not attended civil schools in the village all participated in this "Political Class" for learning, with the number of participants reaching as high as 245 (nearly one-third of the village's population). Throughout the winter, several pamphlets such as "Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries," "Marriage Law," and "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Member Textbook" were taught, and issues such as resisting America and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and revising patriotic pacts were explained based on newspapers and propaganda worker manuals, which greatly promoted various tasks at that time.

    After the Spring Festival, in order not to delay production, the "Political Class" was changed to classes once every five days; from the spring plowing season, it was changed again to once every ten days, and it was named "Patriotic Inspection Day." In addition to explaining current affairs and policies at each meeting, work such as inspecting and arranging spring plowing and drought resistance was also carried out. This system has been maintained ever since. After October 1952, according to the unified regulations of the whole county, Ma Wangzhuang changed the Patriotic Inspection Day to be held on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month.

    The Patriotic Inspection Day activities in Ma Wangzhuang are closely integrated with the activities of the village's Party, government, and Communist Youth League, and women's work also revolves around the Patriotic Inspection Day activities. Two nights before each Patriotic Inspection Day, the Party's小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) in the village hold小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) meetings to inspect work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and plan for the next stage of work. For example, at the小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) meeting held by the Wang Laobei Production Cooperative Party member小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) on November 15, 1952, they first inspected the cotton field autumn plowing, cotton stalk removal, and autumn grain collection work. During the inspection, it was found that individual Party members had not completed their work tasks, and criticism was carried out at the meeting, and those who made mistakes also made self-criticism. The meeting also discussed the work of autumn plowing, manure accumulation, flour milling, charcoal pulling, and attending civil schools in the second half of the month, and studied how Party members could lead the masses to complete these tasks.

    The night before the Patriotic Inspection Day, a joint meeting of village propagandists and heads of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is held. The main purpose is to check the completion of work in the first half of the month, understand the ideological trends of the masses, and then study the work plan and propaganda tasks for the second half of the month. For example, the joint meeting on the evening of November 16 last year found during the inspection that some people thought that the tense production season had passed and had the idea of relaxing winter production; it was also found that some elderly people had negative emotions such as "the future society is good, but we can't catch up" after listening to the propaganda about Sino-Soviet friendship. Therefore, the meeting decided to give a good explanation to the masses on these ideas at the Patriotic Inspection Day meeting the next day.

    After this meeting, the village's "Patriotic Inspection Committee" (all兼 (jiān; concurrent) Party branch committee members) stayed to continue the meeting. Based on the results of the Party小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) meetings and this meeting, they made a work summary, proposed a draft work plan for the second half of the month, and determined which people and things should be commended and which behaviors should be criticized at the Patriotic Inspection Day meeting. These are all preparations for the Patriotic Inspection Day.

    On the day of the Patriotic Inspection Day, the national flag is raised on the roof of the elementary school, and flags are also hung at the entrances of various production cooperatives. Drums are beaten twice as a signal for preparing to meet and starting the meeting. The masses of the whole village quickly gather in units of production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. At the beginning of the meeting, the village chief and Party branch secretary explain the content of the meeting that day. Then, a responsible cadre working in the village (selected people with relatively high political and cultural levels and strong propaganda work ability) makes a report. Generally, they first briefly introduce national events (such as the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference held in Beijing and the strength of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance at the meeting on November 17 last year), and then report on the work summary of the first half of the month, combined with commendation and criticism (commendation is the main focus). For example, in the Patriotic Inspection Day大会 (dàhuì; general assembly) report on November 17, when talking about the autumn grain collection, it was explained that all the cotton collected in the village was of the highest quality. Because the quality of the cotton was good, it exceeded the autumn grain collection task, and the excess was more than 4,000 jin of 合米 (hémǐ; polished rice). The report commended the Wang Deyu Production Cooperative for its spirit of mutual assistance and love in the collective cotton delivery in the whole village, and unreservedly criticized the backward behavior of three or four households who handed in inferior cotton. After reporting the work summary, time is left for everyone to solicit opinions. Then, the draft work plan for the second half of the month is reported; then, they are dispersed to hold小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) discussions in units of production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Finally, another大会 (dàhuì; general assembly) is continued, where representatives from each社 (shè; cooperative) and组 (zǔ; team) speak, put forward opinions, and challenge each other. The central work for the second half of the month determined at the meeting is written on the "Patriotic Literacy Plaques" at the doors of each household after the meeting, reminding everyone to pay attention regularly.

    In order to implement the work plan set out at the Patriotic Inspection Day大会 (dàhuì; general assembly), after the Patriotic Inspection Day, each社 (shè; cooperative) and组 (zǔ; team) immediately go back to hold meetings of members and team members. Based on the overall plan of the whole village, they formulate detailed and specific plans for each社 (shè; cooperative) and组 (zǔ; team) and revise the patriotic pact. Criticism and self-criticism are also carried out in the meeting. Party members and Communist Youth League members also hold separate meetings after the Patriotic Inspection Day to discuss how to play a leading and exemplary role in their work to ensure the realization of the plan. The village women's federation mobilizes women to work actively in each社 (shè; cooperative) and组 (zǔ; team). They have established fourteen mutual aid childcare groups, so that mothers with children can also participate in production with peace of mind. The village's Young Pioneers team also participates in propaganda work.

    In the work of preparing for the Patriotic Inspection Day大会 (dàhuì; general assembly) and implementing the resolutions of the大会 (dàhuì; general assembly), propaganda work has played an extremely important role. The Party members and propagandists in Ma Wangzhuang implement the method of "contracting" propaganda by dividing into片 (piàn; zones), dividing into组 (zǔ; teams), and dividing into households. The Party branch has a "Propagandist Question and Answer Room," which contains newspapers and propaganda worker manuals. It is a place for propagandists to study and also a place to answer people's questions. Propagandists take turns on duty there during the midday break every day, and the masses often go to ask questions. When propagandists encounter difficulties in their work, they also discuss and solve them collectively there. In addition to oral propaganda, the most important form of propaganda is reading newspapers. In winter, each社 (shè; cooperative) and组 (zǔ; team) has sixteen newspaper readers who read newspapers when members and team members meet every night; during the busy farming season, they are divided into eleven "field newspaper reading组 (zǔ; teams)" and read newspapers in three places for midday breaks in the village. In addition, the village has seven blackboards, one rooftop broadcast, and a 快板 (kuàibǎn; clapper talk)小组 (xiǎozǔ; group) composed of seven people. Propaganda is often carried out based on current events and central work.

    Over the past year or so, with the implementation of the Patriotic Inspection Day, the political awareness level of the masses in the village has been greatly improved. For example, during the autumn grain collection in 1952, even children knew that "we must hand in clean and white cotton, which will top up the rice and also be patriotic." More than 30,000 jin of cotton to be paid were delivered early in the morning the day after receiving the notice. For example, regarding the future of agricultural development, the old ladies in the village also know that in the future, we will move towards collectivization, establish collective farms, use machines to farm, and people's lives will be happier, and they also know that collectivization is not "eating from the big pot." Agricultural socialist thought has been eliminated among the masses. All 151 households in the village have been organized. There are seven production cooperatives, nine year-round mutual aid teams, and one seasonal mutual aid team. The village's patriotic production increase movement and various tasks have been completed very well. In 1952, because the work of cultivation, drought resistance, fertilization, weeding, and pest control was done well, the average yield of谷地 (gǔdì; grain land) per mu increased by 107 jin. This village has become an advanced village with a strong political atmosphere and full of vitality.

    定县马王庄的爱国检查日是怎样组织的
    葛叔华
    河北省定县九区马王庄，是实行爱国检查日制度有显著成绩的一个村庄。他们的爱国检查日是在群众的时事、政策学习组织的基础上建立起来的。一九五一年冬天，因为村里有一些未入民校学习的老年人要求村干部经常给他们讲解时事，于是村里为他们成立了一个“政治班”，每三天上课一次。村里的老年人和未入民校学习的壮年男女都参加了这个“政治班”学习，人数最多时达二百四十五人（将近全村人口三分之一）。整个冬天讲授了“坚决镇压反革命”、“婚姻法”、“中苏友协会员课本”等几个小册子，并根据报纸和宣传员手册讲解了抗美援朝、增产节约、修订爱国公约等问题，给当时各项工作起了很大的推动作用。
    春节以后，为了不误生产，“政治班”改为五天上课一次；春耕时起又改为十天一次，并定名为“爱国检查日”，每次会上除了讲解时事、政策之外，并检查、布置春耕、抗旱等工作。这种制度一直坚持下来了。一九五二年十月以后，根据全县统一的规定，马王庄把爱国检查日改在阴历每月初一、十五举行。
    马王庄的爱国检查日活动，是和村里党、政府、青年团的活动密切结合的，妇女工作也围绕着爱国检查日活动。每次爱国检查日举行前两天晚上，村里党的各小组都举行小组会议，检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，并酝酿下一阶段的工作。例如王老北生产合作社党员小组在一九五二年十一月十五日举行的小组会议上，首先检查了棉田秋耕、拔棉秸和秋征等工作。检查中发现个别党员没有完成他的工作任务，在会上进行了批评，犯错误的人并作了自我批评。会上又商量了下半月的秋耕、积肥、磨粉、拉炭、上民校等工作，并研究了党员如何带动群众完成这些任务。
    爱国检查日举行前一天晚上，村里宣传员和农业生产合作社社长、互助组长举行联席会议。主要是检查上半月的工作完成情况，了解群众思想动态，然后研究下半月的工作计划和宣传任务。例如去年十一月十六日晚上的联席会议，在检查中发现了部分群众认为紧张的生产季节已过，有放松冬季生产的“歇一歇”思想；又发现部分老年人听了关于中苏友好的宣传以后，有“将来的社会是好，就是我们赶不上”的消极情绪。于是会中决定在第二天的爱国检查日大会上要针对这些思想向群众作很好的解释。
    　这次会议举行之后，村里的“爱国检查委员”
    （都是党支部委员兼的）留下来继续开会，他们根据党的各小组会议和这次会议的结果，作出工作总结，提出下半月工作计划草案，并确定在爱国检查日会议上那些人、那些事应受表扬，那些行为要批评。这些都是爱国检查日的准备工作。
    爱国检查日这一天，小学屋顶上升起国旗，各生产合作社门口也挂起旗子。打鼓两次作为预备开会和开会的信号。全村群众以生产合作社、互助组为单位迅速地集合起来。开会时首先由村长和党支部书记说明当天会议内容。接着即由一个村工作的负责干部（推选政治、文化水平比较高，宣传工作能力比较强的人）作报告。一般首先扼要介绍一下国家大事（如去年十一月十七日会议上介绍了在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就和中苏友好同盟力量的强大），接着报告上半月的工作总结，结合进行表扬和批评（表扬为主）。如十一月十七日的爱国检查日大会报告中，谈到秋征这项时，就说明全村缴的都是上等棉，因为棉花质量好，超过了秋征任务，超过的部分合米四千多斤；报告中表扬了王德玉生产合作社在全村集体送棉中的互助互爱精神，并对三、四户缴次等棉的落后行为不指名地提出了批评。报告工作总结后，留出一个时间征求大家的意见。然后又报告下半月的工作计划草案；以后即分散以生产合作社、互助组为单位举行小组的讨论。最后又继续开大会，由各社、组代表发言，提出意见并相互进行挑战竞赛。会上所确定的下半月中心工作，会后写在各家各户门口的“爱国识字牌”上，提起大家经常注意。
    为了贯彻爱国检查日大会上定出的工作计划，各社、组在爱国检查日举行以后立即回去召开社员、组员会议，根据全村总的计划，订出各社、组的详细具体的计划并修订爱国公约，开会中也进行批评与自我批评。党员和青年团员在爱国检查日以后也分别召开会议，讨论怎样在工作中起领导、带头作用，保证计划的实现。村妇女联合会则动员妇女在各社、组内积极工作。她们成立了十四个互助托儿组，使有孩子的母亲也都能放心参加生产。村里的少年儿童队也参加宣传工作。
    在准备爱国检查日大会并贯彻大会决议的工作中，宣传工作起了极重大的作用。马王庄的党员和宣传员，实行分片、分组、分户的“包干”宣传的办法。党支部设有“宣传员问答室”，内有报纸和宣传员手册，是宣传员的学习场所，也是解答群众疑难的场所。每天歇晌时有宣传员轮流在那里值班，群众时常去问问题。宣传员在工作中遇到疑难，也在那儿集体讨论解决。宣传形式除了口头宣传外，最重要的是读报。在冬季，各社、组内设有十六个读报员，在社员、组员每晚碰头的时候读报；农忙时，则分成十一个“地头读报组”和在村内三处歇晌地方读报。此外，村里还有七块黑板报、一处屋顶广播和一个由七人组成的快板小组。经常根据当前时事和中心工作进行宣传。
    一年多来，随着爱国检查日的实行，村里群众的政治觉悟水平大大提高了。如一九五二年秋征时，连小孩子都知道“要交干白净，既多顶米，又是爱国”。三万多斤应缴纳的棉花，在接到通知的第二天一个早晨就交齐了。又如对农业发展的前途，村里老太太们也知道将来要走到集体化，建立集体农庄，用机器种地，人民生活会更幸福，而且知道集体化并不是“吃大锅饭”。农业社会主义思想在群众中已消除了。全村一百五十一户已全部组织起来。计有七个生产合作社、九个常年互助组和一个季节性互助组。村里的爱国增产运动和各项工作，都完成得很好。一九五二年因为耕作、抗旱、施肥、锄草、除虫等工作都做得好，每亩谷地平均增产一百零七斤。这个村已经变成了一个政治空气浓厚、生气勃勃的先进村了。
