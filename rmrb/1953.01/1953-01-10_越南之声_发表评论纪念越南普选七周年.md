Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 9th: The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station broadcast a commentary on January 7th entitled "Our People's Government is Growing Stronger," commemorating the seventh anniversary of the Vietnamese general election. The commentary stated: "On January 6, 1946, the Vietnamese people joyfully held their first general election, electing the National Assembly to formulate a constitution and elect the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This achievement was the result of the long-term struggle of the Vietnamese people against the enslavement of the French colonialists. Leading this struggle was the Vietnamese working class and its general staff – the former Indochinese Communist Party."

The commentary pointed out: "Since then, the Vietnamese army and people have annihilated 250,000 French troops in the war of resistance, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy. While the French government has collapsed and reorganized seventeen times, the prestige of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been growing at home and abroad. The Vietnamese government has established embassies in the Soviet Union and China and has been recognized by the people's democratic countries. The friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of friendly countries has been further strengthened."

The commentary continued: "The strength and prestige of our people's government are growing because it is a truly people's government, elected by the people and always striving to serve the people. The government implemented policies of rent reduction and interest rate reduction in rural areas, and distributed more than 250,000 hectares of land formerly belonging to French colonialists and traitors to more than 420,000 farmers for their use; it implemented correct financial and economic policies, stabilizing prices. The production increase and conservation plan of 1952 promoted the production increase movement. Nearly 14 million people have learned to read and write. Currently, every village in the liberated area has a school. Since its establishment, the people's government has overcome many difficulties, brought practical benefits to the people, and won the enthusiastic support of the people."

The commentary concluded: "Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam National United Front, our people have become an invincible force. Encouraged by the military victories in the Northwest and the North Vietnam Plain last year and the brilliant achievements of the World People's Peace Congress, the Vietnamese people commemorate the seventh anniversary of the first general election in Vietnamese history, determined to more actively strike at the enemy and increase production to defend their government, built by the blood and flesh of countless heroes, and strive for the complete victory of the long and arduous struggle."

    “越南之声”发表评论纪念越南普选七周年
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：“越南之声”广播电台七日以“我们的人民政权日益壮大”为题，评论越南大选七周年纪念。评论说：一九四六年一月六日，越南全国人民兴高彩烈地举行了第一次普选，选出了国民大会来制定宪法和选举越南民主共和国政府。这一成就是越南人民反对法国殖民者的奴役进行长期斗争的结果。领导这一斗争的是越南工人阶级和它的参谋部——前印度支那共产党。
    评论指出：从那时候以来，越南军队和人民在抗战中歼灭了二十五万法军，给予敌人以沉重的打击。在法国政府倒台和重组了十七次的同时，越南民主共和国政府在国内和海外的威望日益提高。越南政府建立了驻苏联和中国的大使馆，获得了人民民主国家的承认。越南人民和友好国家人民的友谊进一步加强了。
    评论接着说：我们人民政权的力量和威望之所以日益增长，是由于这个政权是真正的人民的政权，它是由人民选举出来并始终努力为人民服务的政权。政府在农村中实行减租减息的政策，并把以前属于法国殖民者和卖国贼的二十五万公顷以上的土地分给了四十二万以上的农民使用；执行了正确的财政经济政策，使物价稳定。一九五二年的增产节约计划推进了增产运动。差不多一千四百万人学会了读书和写字。目前解放区的每一个村庄都有学校。人民政权自成立以来，克服了许多困难，给人民带来了实际的利益，得到了人民的热烈拥护。
    评论最后说：在胡志明主席、越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和越南国民联合战线的领导下，我国人民已成为一支不可战胜的力量。在去年西北部和北越平原的军事胜利和世界人民和平大会的辉煌成就的鼓舞之下，越南人民纪念越南历史上第一次大选的七周年，决心更积极地打击敌人，增加生产，以保卫他们的由无数英雄的血肉建立起来的政权，争取长期而艰苦的斗争的彻底胜利。
