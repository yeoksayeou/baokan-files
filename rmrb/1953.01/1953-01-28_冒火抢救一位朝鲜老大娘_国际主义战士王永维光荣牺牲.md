Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th: Another internationalist fighter in the style of Luo Shengjiao has emerged in the Chinese People's Volunteers: Wang Yongwei. He gloriously sacrificed himself during an enemy air raid while rescuing a 73-year-old Korean woman.

Wang Yongwei was a nurse at a field hospital of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. On the evening of November 20th of last year, while he was on duty patrolling near the ward, the village where he was stationed was suddenly bombed and set ablaze by many bombs dropped by enemy planes. He immediately braved the danger and rushed into the fire to rescue the wounded and supplies. He first carried out a wounded soldier of the People's Army and then rescued four packages of grain from the home of a local villager. Finally, ward number six caught fire, and he knew that a 73-year-old Korean woman, Song Dong, was still inside. He braved the raging fire to rescue her; unfortunately, just as he carried her to the door, a heavy bomb landed in front of him. Wang Yongwei and the elderly Korean woman, Song Dong, both sacrificed themselves on the spot. After his death, Wang Yongwei's two hands were still tightly holding Song Dong on his back, and Song Dong was motionless on Wang Yongwei's back. The blood of the Korean mother and the blood of the young Chinese people's fighter flowed together.

Wang Yongwei was from Daqiao Township, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, and was 22 years old at the time of his sacrifice. In 1950, he joined the Volunteers after graduating from middle school. In the army, he received the education and training of the Communist Party and quickly transformed from an ordinary young intellectual into a strong people's fighter. He often used the Party's good daughter, Zhao Guilan, to educate himself and wrote in his diary: "Comparing myself to the qualities of Communist Party member Zhao Guilan makes me deeply realize that being an accomplished youth does not depend on the size of his power or the height of his position, but on whether he is loyal to the Party and the people's revolutionary cause, whether he works hard and diligently, and whether he strives to work hard on every specific matter."

After Wang Yongwei's sacrifice, the Korean people in the village where the hospital was located deeply mourned him. On December 1st, the people of a certain county held a public memorial meeting for martyr Wang Yongwei and moved Comrade Wang Yongwei's coffin to be buried in the Korean People's Cemetery. The Chairman of the County People's Committee, the person in charge of the Labor Party, the Chairman of the Fatherland Unification Front, and representatives from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers all paid tribute at the martyr's tomb. Song Genyu, the grandson of Song Dong, stood solemnly in front of the tomb of martyr Wang Yongwei and declared in grief: "You are our loved one, and we will commemorate you for generations to come."

In order to commend the immortal internationalist spirit of martyr Wang Yongwei, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers specially awarded martyr Wang Yongwei a first-class merit and posthumously awarded him the honorary titles of "Second-Class Model" and "Model League Member."

    冒火抢救一位朝鲜老大娘
    国际主义战士王永维光荣牺牲
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军中又出现了一个罗盛教式的国际主义战士王永维。他在一次敌机的轰炸中，为抢救一位七十三岁的朝鲜老大娘而光荣牺牲。
    王永维是志愿军某部野战卫生所护士，中国新民主主义青年团团员。去年十一月二十日晚上，他担任值班员在病房附近巡逻时，忽然他所在的村庄被敌机投下的许多炸弹炸起火了。他立即冒着危险冲进火里去抢救伤员和物资。他首先把人民军的一个伤员背了出来，接着又到老乡家里抢出四包粮食。最后六号病房着火了，他知道里面还有一位七十三岁的朝鲜老大娘宋东氏没有出来，便又冒着烈火冲进去抢救；不幸刚背到门口，一颗重磅炸弹落在面前，王永维和朝鲜老大娘宋东氏当场都牺牲了。死后，王永维的两只手仍紧紧地背着宋老大娘，宋老大娘一动不动地伏在王永维背上。朝鲜母亲的血和中国年青的人民战士的血流在一起。
    王永维是四川省南部县大桥乡人，牺牲时二十二岁。一九五零年他由中学校毕业后参加了志愿军。在部队中他受到共产党的教育和培养，很快就由一个普通青年知识分子锻炼成坚强的人民战士。他常拿党的好女儿赵桂兰来教育自己，并在日记上写着：“用共产党员赵桂兰的品质来对照我使我深深感到：作一个有为的青年，不在于他的职权大小、地位高低，而在于他对党对人民的革命事业是否忠心耿耿，是否任劳任怨地埋头苦干，是否对每件具体事情都是努力工作。”
    王永维牺牲后，卫生所所在村庄的朝鲜人民都沉痛地哀悼他。十二月一日，某郡人民召开了公祭王永维烈士大会，将王永维同志的灵柩移葬在朝鲜人民公墓里。郡人民委员长、劳动党负责人、祖国统一战线委员长及志愿军某部代表等都到烈士墓前致祭。宋老大娘的孙子宋根玉肃立在王永维烈士墓前沉痛地宣誓说：“你是我们的亲人，我们要子子孙孙永世相传地纪念你。”
    中国人民志愿军政治部为了褒扬王永维烈士不朽的国际主义精神，特给王永维烈士追记一等功，并追授予“二级模范”和“模范团员”的光荣称号。
