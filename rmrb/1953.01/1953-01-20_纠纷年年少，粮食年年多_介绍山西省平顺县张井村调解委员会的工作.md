    Fewer Disputes Each Year, More Grain Each Year
    —Introducing the Work of the Mediation Committee of Zhangjing Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province
    Xiong Xianjue
    The Mediation Committee of Zhangjing Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, was established in 1942 on the basis of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement. Because the village's political power was usurped by the landlord class at that time, the mediation committee, controlled by the village government, not only failed to resolve disputes for the peasants but also oppressed them. After the land reform in 1946, the broad masses of peasants seized political power. Under the task of ensuring the development of production, the Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee was reorganized. The reorganized Mediation Committee had eighteen members, all of whom were elected by the masses, including five party cadres and thirteen impartial farmers. These mediation committee members were active elements among the masses, who were very concerned about the interests of the masses and enthusiastic about serving the masses. In recent years, under the care of the county and district leading organs, the mediation work in Zhangjing Village has achieved remarkable results. As the peasants of Zhangjing Village said: "Fewer disputes each year, more grain each year!"
    The mediation work in Zhangjing Village has the following two characteristics:
    First, the mediation work is closely integrated with the central work and serves production. For example, after the end of the land reform in Zhangjing Village in 1948, when land certificates were issued and property rights were determined, the peasants' enthusiasm for production was high, but there were many disputes. Disputes often arose over land, houses, and other large and small properties where property rights had not been clearly defined. The Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee took the initiative to actively publicize the land reform policy, educate the peasants to unite, and mediate disputes among the masses, so that the work of issuing land certificates was successfully completed. In the half-year period from the winter of 1948 to the spring of 1949 alone, it mediated more than 360 property disputes in the issuance of land certificates. For example, four years ago, the peasants of two small natural villages, Huiyuanjiao and Muguanya, wanted to dig a canal to irrigate their fields. The canal had to pass through the land of Liu Jinkui in Zhangjing Village. Although the two villages were willing to pay four dan of rice to buy the land for the canal, it was not completed because Liu Jinkui did not agree. In the drought resistance movement in 1952, the Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee educated Liu Jinkui with the principle of patriotism and increased production, as well as the idea that all peasants in the world belong to one family. The two small natural villages also agreed to give Liu Jinkui five dou of grain each year as compensation, and the canal was agreed upon, turning the forty-four mu of dry land in the two small natural villages into paddy fields. The people of the two villages were very grateful and called the director of the Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee "the people's judge." In the past, the crops in Zhangjing Village were often eaten by cattle and sheep in entire plots and acres, and disputes between peasants and herdsmen constantly occurred. According to the spirit of increasing production and saving, the Mediation Committee held a meeting of herdsmen and educated them on the principles of patriotism and increasing production. After several meetings, the herdsmen all expressed that they would be careful in herding cattle and sheep in the future and ensure that cattle and sheep would no longer damage crops and forests. Later, one herdsman accidentally let his sheep eat five or six pumpkins of Cui Genming. He immediately apologized and said: "Uncle Genming, I was careless, and the sheep ate your pumpkins. Let me pick up two loads of manure for you!" When Genming saw the herdsman’s automatic self-criticism, he didn’t get angry and didn’t ask the herdsman for compensation. Because the herdsmen were careful in herding, no incidents of cattle and sheep damaging crops and forests occurred by last autumn.
    Second, the Mediation Committee not only actively resolves disputes that have already occurred among the masses, but also actively publicizes the government's policies and laws, educates the masses, and prevents the occurrence of disputes. In particular, it has achieved the greatest success in publicizing marriage policies and mediating family disputes. For example, the woman Fang Yuanhua was a child bride for seven or eight years and suffered from oppression and pain. The Mediation Committee and the village women's association encouraged Fang Yuanhua to participate in the people's school and supported her in dissolving the painful marriage. Since then, Fang Yuanhua has taken the lead in production and study, and everyone praises her. Yang Liujiang did not support his parents, so the Mediation Committee took the initiative to mediate at Yang's home, explain the Marriage Law, and explain that children have the obligation to support their parents, so that Yang Liujiang made a self-criticism to his parents on the spot, expressing that he would take good care of his parents in the future. His parents said with emotion: "I just thought that the old people had no way to survive, who would have thought that the new society also called for respecting and caring for the elderly, Chairman Mao is so good!"
    From the reorganization of the Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee in 1946 to the end of September last year, it has mediated more than 700 various disputes. Each dispute, at the lowest estimate, can save the peasants four days of labor, a total of 2,800 days of labor; calculated at five jin of millet per day of labor, it can save the peasants 14,000 jin of millet. The Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee not only resolved many disputes, but more importantly, publicized policies, educated the masses, prevented many disputes from occurring, and enhanced the strength of unity and production. Before 1946, more than 60 families in Zhangjing Village were at odds with their neighbors and did not speak to each other when they met, but now they get along well. Because there were not many problems in the village, some members of the Mediation Committee felt that this organization was no longer needed last spring. After hearing this, the peasants expressed their opinions in the people's school: The Mediation Committee has resolved 700 or 800 disputes for our village and has done so many good things, it must not be cancelled! Villager Liu Jianyuan said: "In the old society, we had problems and no one cared about them. If we looked for the village 'Litigation Resolution Association' (organized by the Yan Xishan bandit gang), we had to pay a silver dollar first, and the matter would not be resolved well; now the Mediation Committee led by the Communist Party is really good. When something happens to someone's family, the mediation committee members will find the door to reconcile it, and they don't even eat. Last year, my family was not in harmony, and the director of the Mediation Committee came to my house three times to reconcile it, and the whole family was more harmonious than before."
    Judging from the work of the Zhangjing Village Mediation Committee in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, the Mediation Committee is indeed needed by the masses. It can both resolve internal conflicts among the people and publicize policies. It is an important institution for the root of the people's judicial work among the masses and therefore needs to be further strengthened.

    纠纷年年少，粮食年年多
    ——介绍山西省平顺县张井村调解委员会的工作
  　熊先觉
    山西平顺县张井村调解委员会是在一九四二年减租减息运动的基础上建立起来的。由于当时该村的政权被地主阶级篡夺，在村政权支配下的调解委员会，不但不给农民解决纠纷，反而欺压农民。一九四六年土地改革以后，广大农民掌握了政权，张井村调解委员会在保证发展生产的任务下，又经过整顿，重新组织起来。重新组织起来的调解委员会有十八个委员，都是由群众选举产生的，其中党员干部五人，公正农民十三人。这些调解委员是群众中的积极分子，非常关心群众利益、热心为群众服务。几年来，张井村调解工作在县区领导机关的关怀下获得了显著成绩。正如张井村农民所说：“纠纷一年比一年少，粮食一年比一年多！”
    张井村的调解工作有以下两个特点：
    首先，调解工作紧密地结合中心工作并为生产服务。例如，一九四八年张井村土地改革结束，颁发土地证，确定产权时，农民的生产热情虽高，但纠纷很多，对未划清产权的土地、房屋及其他大小财物，往往发生争执。张井村调解委员会便主动地积极地宣传土地改革政策，教育农民团结，调解群众间的纠纷，使颁发土地证的工作顺利完成。仅在一九四八年冬到一九四九年春的半年时间，即调解了颁发土地证中的财产纠纷三百六十余件。又如，四年前，回元郊、木柧涯两个小自然村的农民，想开渠灌田，水渠须经过张井村刘进魁的土地，两村虽愿出四石米买地开渠，但因为刘进魁不同意，而未办成。在一九五二年抗旱运动中，张井村调解委员会以爱国增产及天下农民是一家的道理对刘进魁进行教育；两个小自然村又确定每年给刘进魁五斗谷子作为补偿，开渠达成了协议，使两个小自然村的四十四亩旱地变成了水地。两村人民非常感激，称张井村调解委员会主任是“人民的审判员”。过去，张井村的庄稼，常整块整亩地被牛羊吃光，农民与牧工不断发生纠纷。调解委员会根据增产节约的精神，召开了牧工会议，教育牧工懂得了爱国增产的道理；经过几次会议，牧工们都表示今后一定小心放牧牛羊，保证不再让牛羊损害庄稼和树林。后来有一个牧工，一时不小心，他放的羊吃了崔根明的五、六棵南瓜，他便马上去道歉说：“根明叔叔，我一时不小心，羊吃了你的瓜，我给你拾上两担粪吧！”根明见牧工自动检讨，也未发脾气，也不要牧工赔偿了。由于牧工小心放牧，到去年秋天，再没有发生牛羊损害庄稼、树林的事情。
    其次，调解委员会不但主动地解决群众已发生的纠纷，而且积极地宣传政府的政策法令，教育群众，预防纠纷的发生。特别是在宣传婚姻政策，调处家庭纠纷方面成绩最大。如妇女方元花当了七八年童养媳，受尽了压迫与痛苦，调解委员会和村妇女会鼓励方元花参加了民校，并支持她解除了痛苦的婚姻。以后，方元花生产学习样样带头，人人称赞。杨六江不供养父母，调解委员就主动到杨家调解，讲解婚姻法，说明子女有供养父母的义务，使杨六江当面向父母作了检讨，表示今后要好好奉养父母。他的父母感动地说：“我只想老人没活路了，谁想到新社会也叫敬养老人，毛主席真好！”
    张井村调解委员会自一九四六年改组到去年九月底，共计和解了各种纠纷七百余件。每件纠纷，最低估计可省农民日工四个，共可省工二千八百个；每工以五斤小米计算，即可节省农民小米一万四千斤。张井村调解委员会不仅解决了许多纠纷，更重要的是宣传了政策，教育了群众，防止了不少纠纷的发生，增强了团结生产的力量。张井村在一九四六年以前，有六十多家和街邻不和，见面不说话，现在则和好相处。由于村中问题不多，去年春天调解委员会有些委员便觉得这个组织不需要了。农民听说后，在民校纷纷提出意见：调解委员会给咱村解决了七、八百件纠纷，办了这样多的好事，万万不能取消！村民刘尖元说：“在旧社会，咱们有了问题没人管，找村中‘息讼会’（阎锡山匪帮组织的），先得出一块现洋，事也和解不好；现在共产党领导的调解委员会真好，谁家出了事，调解委员就找到门上给和解，连饭也不吃。去年我家不和气，调解委员会主任到我家和解了三次，给和解得全家比以前还和睦。”
    从山西省平顺县张井村调解委员会的工作情况来看，调解委员会确是群众所需要的，它既能解决人民内部纠纷，又可宣传政策，是人民司法工作在群众中生根的重要机构，因而有进一步加强的必要。
