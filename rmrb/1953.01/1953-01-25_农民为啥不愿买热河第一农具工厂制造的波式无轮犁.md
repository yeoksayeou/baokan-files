    Why Farmers Are Unwilling to Buy the Wave-Type Wheelless Plow Manufactured by the First Agricultural Implement Factory in Rehe

    Editor: The wave-type wheelless plow manufactured by the First Agricultural Implement Factory in Rehe Province is of very poor quality and easily damaged, which has affected the autumn plowing work of many farmers and the promotion of new agricultural implements in the future.

    During last year's autumn plowing, farmers in various regions reported that the beam of the wave-type wheelless plow manufactured by the factory would be straightened after plowing only a small amount of land. According to reports from Ningcheng, Luanping, Xinglong, Kazuo, and Kalaqin counties and banners alone, seventeen wave-type wheelless plows were damaged. In addition, the plowshare of this type of plow is not hard enough, wears out easily, and the parts are also prone to damage.

    The wave-type wheelless plow can indeed be promoted. However, due to the shoddy workmanship of the First Agricultural Implement Factory, many farmers are unwilling to use this plow. As some people said: "This plow is not durable, I'm not going to waste money buying this toy!" The Cao Zhe Mutual Aid Team in the Fourth District of Xinglong County bought this kind of plow, but as soon as they heard others say that this plow was easily damaged, they immediately returned it. In order to enable new agricultural implements to be widely promoted and play their due role in improving agricultural production, I suggest that the First Agricultural Implement Factory in Rehe Province should pay attention to product quality, strictly implement product inspection systems, and eliminate the phenomenon of shoddy workmanship in the production of new agricultural implements.　Yin Zhong

    农民为啥不愿买热河第一农具工厂制造的波式无轮犁
    编辑同志：热河省第一农具工厂制造的波式无轮犁质量很差，极易损坏，以致影响了很多农民的秋耕工作和今后新式农具的推广。
    在去年秋耕中，各地农民反映：用该厂制造的波式无轮犁，犁不了好多地，犁辕就被拉直了。仅据宁城、滦平、兴隆、喀左和喀喇沁等县旗反映，波式无轮犁损坏的就达十七台。此外，这种犁的犁尖硬度不够，经不住磨，零件也容易损坏。
    波式无轮犁确是可以推广的。但是，由于第一农具工厂的粗制滥造，很多农民就不愿意使用这种犁了。像有的群众说：这犁不结实，可不花钱买这个玩艺儿！兴隆县四区曹哲互助组买了这种犁，一听别人说这种犁容易坏，马上就把犁退回了。为了使新式农具能够大量地推广并对提高农业生产起应有的作用，我建议热河省第一农具工厂应该重视产品质量、严格产品检查制度，消灭生产新式农具时粗制滥造的现象。　尹忠
