Xinhua News Agency report: The Second National Health Conference was recently held in Beijing. He Cheng, Vice-Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, delivered a report at the conference entitled "Strive to Continue the Patriotic Health Campaign" (see page three of today's newspaper). In his report, He Cheng summarized the achievements and experiences of the national patriotic health campaign in 1952 and proposed the guiding principles and tasks for continuing the patriotic health campaign in 1953. Twelve representatives of national health model units and model workers made typical reports at the conference. After group discussions, the attending representatives unanimously agreed that to do a good job in health work, it is necessary to combine health work with the broad masses and carry out mass patriotic health campaigns. The attending representatives studied in detail the deeds and experiences of model units and model individuals in various regions. For example, in Beijing, due to the mobilization of the masses to carry out the patriotic health campaign, a large amount of garbage left over from before liberation was removed, the Longxugou, which was full of foul-smelling water, was transformed into a sewer, and the Taoranting and Longtan were built into beautiful scenic spots, creating the miracle that flies almost disappeared. The Second Company of a certain army of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army killed a total of 85,483 rats by mobilizing all its commanders and fighters. Shang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, mobilized the masses to carry out the patriotic health campaign, increasing fertilizer by one-third and grain production by 26,400 jin in 1952 compared to 1951, and reducing the incidence of disease by 98.7 percent compared to 1951. These experiences show that the tremendous achievements of the 1952 patriotic health campaign were mainly due to relying on the masses. It was precisely because the masses were mobilized to carry out the great patriotic health campaign that the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism was crushed. After this conference, the participants fully recognized this truth and stated that after returning, they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilize a broader mass base, consolidate the achievements of the 1952 patriotic health campaign, strive to continue the 1953 patriotic health campaign, and achieve even greater results to completely crush the bacteriological war of American imperialism.

During the conference, expert symposiums, people's organization representative symposiums, traditional Chinese medicine symposiums, and ethnic minority representative symposiums were also held. These symposiums put forward many valuable suggestions on how to combine health work with mass movements.

On the afternoon of December 11, Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government specifically gave a report to the attendees of this National Health Conference. In his report, Premier Zhou emphasized the principle that health work must be combined with mass movements. He pointed out that the great achievements of the 1952 patriotic health campaign were mainly due to the efforts of the broad masses of the people and the leading role of health models. In addition, the research and guidance of experts, the leadership of party organizations and people's governments at all levels, the cooperation of troops, people's organizations, and enterprise institutions, and the efforts of health workers, their contributions are also indelible. Because American imperialism is still continuing bacteriological warfare in Korea and our country, in order to continue to defeat the bacteriological warfare waged by the United States, and in order to enhance the physique of our people to ensure the economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction of the motherland, we must not be complacent because of the achievements of 1952, and we must not have the slightest relaxation, and we must continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign to achieve universality, depth, and regularity. Premier Zhou emphasized that health work must be combined with mass movements in order to consolidate achievements and move forward. If health work is not combined with mass movements, the three major principles of health work, "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers," "prevention first," and "unity of Chinese and Western medicine," cannot be well implemented. In order to ensure production construction and national defense construction, and to do a good job in the health work of ethnic minorities, it is necessary to mobilize the masses. Therefore, Premier Zhou instructed that a principle should be added to the future health work policy: "Health work must be combined with mass movements." Premier Zhou encouraged all health workers to develop a democratic work style, learn to do mass work, avoid simplicity and impatience, rely solely on administrative orders, and not consult with the masses, be satisfied with superficial achievements, and not conduct in-depth research. Premier Zhou said that as long as health work is combined with mass movements, health workers will be able to transform themselves well and seek progress.

The national health models, attendees, and observers who participated in this National Health Conference attended the opening ceremony of the National Patriotic Health Movement Exhibition at the Working People's Cultural Palace on the afternoon of the 12th and visited the exhibition.

At the meeting on the morning of December 13, He Cheng, Director of the National Patriotic Health Movement National Health Model Award Committee, presented awards to representatives of national health model units and model workers. Scientific research experts Fang Shishan, Chen Wengui, Wei Xi, and others, who made outstanding achievements in the fight against American imperialist bacteriological warfare, also received honorary awards. The meeting on the afternoon of the 13th was summarized by He Cheng, Vice-Minister of Health of the Central People's Government. He explained that the meeting accepted Premier Zhou's instructions and added the principle of "combining health work with mass movements" to the three major principles of health work, "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers," "prevention first," and "unity of Chinese and Western medicine," as the direction of efforts for future national health work. Regarding the tasks of the 1953 patriotic health campaign, it was decided that each region should formulate specific plans based on general requirements and local specific conditions.

The meeting adopted congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao and congratulatory telegrams to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and medical and health workers on the front lines of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

The meeting lasted six days and closed on the afternoon of December 13, 1952.

    第二届全国卫生会议闭幕
    周总理指示卫生工作要与群众运动相结合
    贺诚副部长提出今年继续开展爱国卫生运动的方针与任务
    据新华社讯：第二届全国卫生会议于最近在北京召开。中央人民政府卫生部副部长贺诚在会议上作了题为“为继续开展爱国卫生运动而斗争”的报告（见本报今日第三版），贺诚在报告中总结了一九五二年全国爱国卫生运动的成绩和经验，提出一九五三年继续开展爱国卫生运动的方针与任务。全国卫生模范单位代表及模范工作者十二人在会议上作了典型报告。经过分组讨论以后，到会代表一致认为：要做好卫生工作，必须使卫生工作与广大群众相结合，开展群众性的爱国卫生运动。到会代表详尽地研究了各地模范单位和模范人物的事迹及其经验。例如：北京市由于发动了群众开展爱国卫生运动，铲除了解放以前遗留下来的大量垃圾，把满蓄臭水的龙须沟修成下水道，把陶然亭与龙潭修筑成美丽的风景区，出现了苍蝇几乎绝迹的奇迹。中国人民志愿军某军二连由于发动了全连指战员，共捕杀老鼠八万五千四百八十三只。陕西省长安县尚村，由于发动了群众开展爱国卫生运动，使全村一九五二年比一九五一年增加肥料三分之一，增产粮食两万六千四百斤，发病率比一九五一年减少百分之九十八点七。这些经验说明：一九五二年爱国卫生运动之巨大成绩，主要是由于依靠了群众而获得的。也正是因为发动了群众进行了伟大的爱国卫生运动，才把美帝国主义所进行的细菌战粉碎了。与会人员经过这次会议，充分认识到这一真理，纷纷表示：会后回去，一定依照毛主席的指示，动员更广大的群众，把一九五二年的爱国卫生运动成绩巩固起来，为继续开展一九五三年的爱国卫生运动而斗争，并使它获得更大的成绩，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战争。
    会议期间并举行了专家座谈会、人民团体代表座谈会、中医座谈会以及少数民族代表座谈会，这些座谈会，就如何使卫生工作与群众运动相结合的问题，提出了许多宝贵的意见。
    中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理于十二月十一日下午，专门对出席这次全国卫生会议的人员作了一次报告。周总理在报告中着重地说明卫生工作必须与群众运动相结合的道理。他指出：一九五二年爱国卫生运动之所以取得这样伟大的成就，主要是依靠了广大人民群众的努力和卫生模范的带头作用；此外，专家们的研究、指导，各级党组织和各级人民政府的领导，部队、人民团体和企业机关的配合，以及卫生工作者的努力，他们的功绩也都是不可磨灭的。由于美帝国主义还继续在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战，为了继续打败美国所进行的细菌战，为了增强我国人民的体质，以保证祖国经济建设、国防建设与文化建设的进行；我们绝不能因有一九五二年的成绩而自满，更不能有丝毫的松懈，必须把爱国卫生运动继续开展下去，达到普遍深入和经常化。周总理强调指出：卫生工作必须与群众运动相结合，才能将成绩巩固起来并向前发展。如果卫生工作不与群众运动结合起来，卫生工作“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”的三大原则，就不可能很好地贯彻。为了保证生产建设与国防建设，为了作好少数民族的卫生工作，都必须发动群众。因此，周总理指示：今后卫生工作方针应增加一条“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的原则。周总理勉励所有卫生工作者要发扬民主的工作作风，学会作群众工作，切忌简单、急躁，单靠行政命令行事，而不去和群众商量，满足于表面的成绩，而不去深入研究。周总理说，只要卫生工作与群众运动相结合，卫生工作者就能够很好地改造自己，求得进步。
    参加这次全国卫生会议的全国卫生模范，出席和列席人员，在十二日下午到劳动人民文化宫参加全国爱国卫生运动展览会开幕式，并参观了展览会。
    在十二月十三日上午会议上，爱国卫生运动全国卫生模范评奖委员会主任贺诚向全国卫生模范单位代表及模范工作者发奖。在反对美国帝国主义细菌战工作中成绩卓著的科学研究专家方石珊、陈文贵、魏曦等，也分别得到了荣誉奖。十三日下午会议由中央人民政府卫生部副部长贺诚作总结，他说明会议接受周总理的指示，在卫生工作“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”三大原则外，增加“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的一条原则，作为今后全国卫生工作努力的方向；关于一九五三年爱国卫生运动的任务，决定由各地根据一般要求结合当地具体情况制订具体计划。
    会议通过了向毛主席致敬电、向中国人民志愿军及抗美援朝前线医药卫生工作者致敬电。
    会议历时六天，在一九五二年十二月十三日下午闭幕。
