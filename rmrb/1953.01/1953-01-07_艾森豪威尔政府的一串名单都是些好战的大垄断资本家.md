Xinhua News Agency, 6th: New York dispatch, American monopoly capitalists are elated because Eisenhower, immediately upon being elected President of the United States, proved his loyalty to the interests of big business. Eisenhower's important government appointments announced to date indicate that he intends to hand over power directly to big capitalists, no longer going through professional politicians.

An Associated Press news item used the following lead: "Big Businessmen are Concentrating in Washington."

The news item continued: "The business community is very pleased to see prominent managers from its major corporations, major banks, and major corporate law firms—many of whom have personal incomes reaching six figures annually—obtaining positions in the Eisenhower administration. Since the election, the industrial and financial sectors have generally expressed confidence, often talking about doing good business in the future." Because—the Associated Press news explained—it is "much better" for the capitalists themselves to handle government affairs directly than to go through professional politicians, because this "allows the business community to do things in a way closer to its liking."

To prove the assertion in its lead, the news item listed a string of names from Eisenhower's senior government appointments, including:

Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson—General Manager of General Motors Corporation, the largest manufacturing company in the United States. General Motors Corporation belongs to the DuPont Consortium, but also has Morgan's shares.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Roger M. Kyes—Deputy General Manager of General Motors Corporation.

Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens—Chairman of Stevens & Co., Inc.

Secretary of the Navy Robert Bernerd Anderson—Texas oil and banking magnate.

Secretary of the Air Force Harold E. Talbott—Director of Chrysler Corporation and a major investment banker.

It is evident that Eisenhower has directly handed over the power of U.S. military decision-making and the authority to spend three-quarters of the national budget to those bloodthirsty monopoly capitalists who make huge profits from war and slaughter. General Motors Corporation is the largest contractor for U.S. government military orders.

In addition, Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey is a giant in the coal, iron, steel, chemical, transportation, and banking industries. These industries have all benefited greatly from the war. Humphrey belongs to the Cleveland Consortium but also has close ties with the DuPont and Rockefeller consortia.

Secretary of State John Foster Dulles—One of the key figures in the Rockefeller Consortium.

Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich—Chairman of Chase Bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, and a key member of the Rockefeller family. It is reported that his appointment was not even consulted with the British government in advance.

Thus, the major U.S. military, diplomatic, and financial powers are directly handed over to the two most aggressively expansionist American consortia, the DuPont Group and the Rockefeller Group. They are particularly enthusiastic about expansion and wars of aggression.

In addition, the Special Assistant responsible for handling the huge federal debt of $267 billion is W. Randolph Burgess of Citibank, one of the largest banks in the United States; the Chairman of the Committee responsible for coordinating government administrative departments is Nelson A. Rockefeller—a member of the Rockefeller Consortium's royalty; Secretary of the Interior Douglas McKay—a major dealer for General Motors Corporation; Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks—a Boston banker and industrialist; Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield—Manager of a real estate company and automobile dealership in Michigan.

    艾森豪威尔政府的一串名单都是些好战的大垄断资本家
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息，美国垄断资本家因为艾森豪威尔刚一当选美国总统就证明他忠实于大企业的利益而兴高采烈。艾森豪威尔迄今已发表的政府重要任命表明他打算把政权交给大资本家直接掌握，而不再经过职业政客转手。
    美联社的一则新闻用了这样的导语：“大企业家都集中到华盛顿去了。”
    这则新闻接着说：“企业界看见自己的大公司、大银行和大公司法律事务所的著名经理——他们许多人的个人收入每年都达到六位数字——获得了艾森豪威尔政府里的职位，大为满意。自从大选以来，工业和金融界普遍表示有信心，时常谈起今后好作生意了。”因为——美联社的消息解释说——由资本家自己直接来处理政务比经过职业政客转一道手要“好得多”，因为这样“使企业界可按照更接近于它所喜欢的方式做事了”。
    为了证明自己导语的论断，这则消息列举了艾森豪威尔的政府高级人员任命中的一串名单，包括：
    国防部长查里斯·欧文·威尔逊——美国最大的制造公司通用汽车公司的总经理。通用汽车公司属于杜邦财团，但也有摩根的股份。
    副国防部长罗奇·姆·凯斯——通用汽车公司的副总经理。
    陆军部长罗伯特·勒·斯蒂文斯——斯蒂文斯公司的董事长。
    海军部长罗伯特·勃纳德·安德逊——得克萨斯州石油和银行界巨子。
    空军部长哈罗德·埃·泰尔波特——克莱斯勒汽车公司董事，又是大投资银行家。
    由此可见，艾森豪威尔已把美国的军事决策和占国家预算四分之三的开支的权力直接交给了那些从战争和屠杀中大发其财的渴血的垄断资本家。通用汽车公司是美国政府军事订货的最大承造者。
    此外，财政部长乔治·汉弗莱是煤、铁、钢、化学、运输和银行业的巨子。这些工业都是因战争而利市百倍的部门。汉弗莱属于克里夫兰财团，但和杜邦及洛克菲勒二大财团也有密切关系。
    国务卿约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯——洛克菲勒财团的要角之一。
    驻英大使温思罗普·吴·阿尔德里治——美国最大的银行之一大通银行董事长，洛克菲勒家属的要员。据悉他的任命甚至事先未征求英国政府的同意。
    这样，美国军事、外交和财政大权是直接交给了美国最富侵略性的两个财团杜邦集团和洛克菲勒集团了。它们对扩张和侵略战争特别热中。
    此外，还有负责处理数达二千六百七十亿美元的巨大联邦债务的特别助理是美国最大银行之一花旗银行的吴·伦道夫·伯吉斯；负责调整政府行政部门的委员会的主席纳尔逊·阿·洛克菲勒——洛克菲勒财团的王族；内政部长道克拉斯·麦凯——通用汽车公司的一个大代理商；商务部长辛克莱尔·威克斯——波士顿的银行家和工业家；邮政总长阿瑟·萨来菲尔德——密执安州的地产公司和汽车经售公司的经理。
