Yunnan Provincial Party and Government Leading Organs Seriously Handle the "Dou Duanxiao Incident"
Luo Shilin Has Been Sentenced to Death, and Mou Meisheng Has Been Expelled from the Party

Editor's Note: After the "Reader's Letters" column published reader Wen Tianying's letter reporting the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" on December 10th last year, more than a thousand readers from all over the country and the Korean front wrote letters expressing their opinions on the handling of this matter. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a "Decision on Punishing Relevant Party Cadres for the Murder of Comrade Dou Duanxiao" on December 27th last year, deciding to expel Mou Meisheng, the former Secretary of the Luxi County Party Committee, from the Party. The Yunnan Provincial People's Supervisory Committee also made a "Decision on Punishing Relevant Cadres for the Murder of Comrade Dou Duanxiao." The Yunnan Provincial People's Court sentenced the murderer Luo Shilin to death on January 4th. The Yunnan Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a decision on January 3rd, posthumously recognizing Comrade Dou Duanxiao as a member of the Youth League. The Yunnan Daily published the above documents on January 4th and published an editorial calling on everyone to "deeply learn from the lessons of the murder of Comrade Dou Duanxiao." Now, we are publishing the decision of the Yunnan Provincial Committee and the Yunnan Provincial People's Court's verdict on the murderer Luo Shilin below.

Decision of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Punishing Relevant Party Cadres for the Murder of Comrade Dou Duanxiao

Comrade Dou Duanxiao, a female youth cadre of the Luxi County Health Center, consistently demanded progress and loved the Party and Chairman Mao. She insisted on opposing the reactionary and illegal acts of reactionary element Luo Shilin (former director of the Luxi County Health Center) and was openly murdered by Luo Shilin during the "Three-Anti" movement. This is a serious political incident that is intolerable. However, the leading Party cadres in Luxi County were extremely wrong in condoning the enemy's persecution of revolutionary comrades throughout the entire incident, causing irreparable losses to the Party and the country. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and educate all Party members, the Provincial Committee has decided to handle the relevant Party cadres as follows:

Mou Meisheng, the former Secretary of the Luxi County Party Committee, should bear serious political responsibility for the murder of Comrade Dou Duanxiao. Mou Meisheng had long known about Luo Shilin's reactionary history before he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, but he did not consider the issue politically. When Luo Shilin openly murdered Comrade Dou Duanxiao, Mou Meisheng turned a blind eye and did nothing, failing to deal with it in a timely manner or report it to higher authorities; he even personally went to "watch," which was simply a serious degeneration to the point of not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, or right and wrong. Before and after the incident, some Party cadres had put forward correct opinions; however, Mou Meisheng refused to accept them. Afterwards, he even advocated not arresting the murderer. When the editorial department of the Yunnan Daily and the Yiliang Prefectural Committee repeatedly urged the Luxi County Committee to handle this incident, he still treated it with indifference. It should be said that he adopted an unforgivable and sinful attitude of condoning and supporting the reactionary elements' crime of murdering revolutionary cadres. Mou Meisheng joined the Party in 1939, had worked for the Party, and had made certain achievements; however, after the victory of the revolution and entry into the cities, he did not seek progress, gradually degenerated, and lost the essence of a Communist Party member. In the early stage of the "Three-Anti" movement, he did not actively lead the movement, but instead engaged in improper relationships between men and women; in the incident of the murder of Comrade Dou Duanxiao, he committed such a serious political error, causing irreparable losses to the Party and the people. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline, enhance the Party's combat effectiveness, and educate him personally, the Provincial Committee has decided, and has submitted to the Southwest Bureau for approval, to give him the punishment of expulsion from the Party.

Comrade Yang Fengtong, member of the Luxi County Party Committee and County Head, was participating in land reform in Luliang County when the incident occurred. After returning to Luxi, although he advocated arresting the murderer Luo Shilin and expressed dissatisfaction with Mou Meisheng's attitude, he did not wage a struggle and did not earnestly supervise the County Public Security Bureau and the County People's Court to quickly handle this incident. This is an act of dereliction of duty lacking principle and irresponsibility to the people. It is decided to give a public warning within the Party and to suggest appropriate administrative punishment.

Communist Party members Yang Chujiang (Director of the Yiliang Special District Health Section), Wang Ming (Director of the Luxi County People's Government Personnel Section), Ma Biao (Secretary of the Luxi County People's Government), and Shao Guanghua (Acting President of the Luxi County People's Court), etc., after learning about this incident, failed to earnestly investigate and handle it, nor did they promptly report it to the leadership, showing political paralysis, irresponsibility to the people, and a lack of organization and discipline. They should be criticized and ordered to make profound self-criticisms.

Other comrades who adopted a liberalist attitude and stood idly by in this incident should be educated to improve their political thinking. Comrades who actively put forward opinions to leading cadres and adhered to a correct stand before and after the occurrence of this incident should be commended.

Although the Yiliang Prefectural Committee has made a public self-criticism for the bureaucratic attitude it adopted in this incident, it should earnestly correct its mistakes in future work.

In order to educate the entire Party and all cadres, Party organizations at all levels throughout the province should organize discussions on this incident and the Provincial Committee's decision to punish the relevant cadres, conduct self-examinations in light of the situation in their own units, so as to overcome bureaucratism and liberalism in their work, and achieve the goal of strengthening political, ideological, and organizational work. As for the murderer Luo Shilin, the Provincial Committee has suggested that the People's Government severely punish him according to law.

Verdict of the Yunnan Provincial People's Court on the Murderer Luo Shilin Who Killed Comrade Dou Duanxiao

Defendant Luo Shilin, 35 years old, is from Mianyang County, Hubei Province. Before liberation, he successively served as a major military doctor, a lieutenant colonel director, and the director of the Sixth Training Office in Beijing for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In 1948, he was captured in Beijing, and after being educated and released, he fled to Hong Kong, attempted to go to Taiwan but failed, and then fled back to Yunnan.

After the counter-revolutionary criminal Luo Shilin arrived in Yunnan, he disguised himself as progressive, infiltrated the Luxi County People's Government, usurped the leading position of the director of the county health center, and used his public authority to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. He once colluded with the counter-revolutionary element Wang Wenliang, using the opportunity of medical treatment to conspire to use poison to kill Comrade Zhang Xixian, the Organization Minister of the Luxi County Party Committee, and other comrades, but failed. He also colluded with Zhang Zhengmin, a backbone member of the bandit Youth Party, to continue to carry out sabotage activities, spreading rumors to confuse the public; subsequently, due to Zhang's arrest, Luo's conspiracy failed. ... (Editor's note: The following paragraph describes the facts of the murderer Luo Shilin's persecution of Comrade Dou Duanxiao, omitted.)

The above facts have been verified by the Yunnan Provincial People's Procuratorate, which has filed a public prosecution requesting that the criminal be punished with the death penalty.

After investigation, the counter-revolutionary element Luo Shilin infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and repeatedly carried out sabotage, using various sinister methods to kill our revolutionary cadres in order to achieve his counter-revolutionary destructive purpose, which ultimately led to the death of our excellent revolutionary youth, which is truly heinous. In order to uphold national laws and discipline and safeguard the interests of the people, according to Article 9, Paragraph 4 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, Luo is sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life. It is now designated that the Luxi County People's Government will convene a mass rally on January 5, 1953, to publicly try and execute the sentence.

    云南省党政领导机关严正处理“窦端孝事件”
    罗时霖已被判处死刑牟梅生已被开除党籍
    编者按：去年十二月十日“读者来信专页”发表了读者文恬英报告“窦端孝事件”经过的来信后，有一千多个读者从全国各地和朝鲜前线来信，提出他们对这件事的处理意见。中共云南省委在去年十二月二十七日已经作出“关于窦端孝同志被杀害事件对有关党员干部的处分决定”，决定开除前泸西县委书记牟梅生党籍。云南省人民监察委员会也作出了“关于窦端孝同志被杀害事件对有关干部的处分决定”。云南省人民法院在一月四日已判处凶犯罗时霖死刑。中国新民主主义青年团云南省工作委员会在一月三日发出决定，追认窦端孝同志为青年团员。云南日报在一月四日刊载了以上文件，并发表社论，号召大家“深刻接受窦端孝同志被杀害事件给我们的教训”。现在，我们把云南省委的决定和云南省人民法院对凶犯罗时霖的判决书发表于后。
    中共云南省委关于窦端孝同志被杀害事件对有关党员干部的处分决定
    泸西县卫生院女青年干部窦端孝同志，一贯要求进步，热爱党和毛主席。她坚持反对反动分子罗时霖（泸西县卫生院前院长）的反动违法行为，在“三反”运动中竟被罗时霖公开杀害。这是一个使人不能容忍的严重政治事件。而泸西县党的领导干部在整个事件中竟极端错误地纵容敌人残害革命同志，造成党和国家不可弥补的损失。为了严肃党的纪律、教育全体党员，省委决定对有关党员干部分别作如下处理：
    前泸西县委书记牟梅生，对窦端孝同志的被害事件应负严重的政治责任。牟梅生早已知道罗时霖混进革命队伍前的反动历史，但没有从政治上来考虑问题。罗时霖公开杀害窦端孝同志时，牟梅生竟熟视无睹、无动于衷，没有及时处理并向上级报告；甚至亲自前去“观看”，这简直蜕化到敌我不分、是非不明的严重地步了。事件发生前后，有些党员干部曾经提出过正确的意见；但牟梅生拒不接受。事后他居然还主张不逮捕凶手。在云南日报编辑部和宜良地委几次催促泸西县委处理这个事件时，他仍然以漠视态度对待。应该说：他对反动分子杀害革命干部的罪行，采取了纵容和支持的不可饶恕的罪恶态度。牟梅生在一九三九年入党，曾经为党做过工作，有过一定成绩；但在革命胜利进入城市后，不求进步，逐渐蜕化，丧失了共产党员的本质。在“三反”运动初期，他不积极领导运动，反而搞不正当的男女关系；在窦端孝同志被杀害的事件中，他又犯了这样严重的政治错误，造成了党和人民不可弥补的损失。为了严肃党纪、提高党的战斗力并教育其本人，省委决定并呈经西南局批准，给以开除党籍的处分。
    泸西县县委委员、县长杨凤桐同志，当事件发生前后，他正在陆良县参加土地改革。他回泸西后，虽曾主张逮捕凶犯罗时霖，并对牟梅生的态度表示不满；但不进行斗争，未认真督促县公安局和县人民法院迅速处理这个事件。这是一种缺乏原则性和对人民群众不负责任的失职行为。决定党内给予当众警告的处分，并建议行政上给予适当处分。
    共产党员杨楚江（宜良专署卫生科长）、王明（泸西县人民政府人事科长）、马彪（泸西县人民政府秘书）、邵光华（泸西县人民法院代理院长）等同志，在知道这个事件后，均未认真检查处理，也不及时报告领导，表现了政治麻痹、对人民不负责任与无组织无纪律。应予批评，并令各作深刻检讨。    对这个事件采取自由主义和袖手旁观态度的其他同志，应该进行教育，提高他们的政治思想。对在这个事件发生前后积极向领导干部提出意见并坚持正确立场的同志，应予表扬。
    宜良地委对在这个事件中采取的官僚主义态度虽已作了公开检讨，但还应在今后工作中切实纠正错误。
    为了教育全党及全体干部，全省各级党的组织应将这个事件及省委对有关干部的处分决定组织讨论，联系本单位情况进行检查，以克服工作中的官僚主义与自由主义，达到加强政治性、思想性、组织性的目的。至于凶犯罗时霖，省委已建议人民政府依法严厉制裁。
                    中国共产党云南省委员会
    云南省人民法院对残杀窦端孝同志的凶手罗时霖的判决书
    被告罗时霖，三十五岁，湖北沔阳县人。他在解放前历任蒋匪帮少校军医、中校主任及北京第六训练处处长等职。一九四八年在北京被俘，经教育释放后逃到香港，企图到台湾未成，又逃回云南。
    反革命罪犯罗时霖到云南后，即伪装进步，混入泸西县人民政府，窃踞该县卫生院院长的领导地位，利用公开职权进行反革命活动。他曾勾结反革命分子王文亮，藉诊病之机阴谋使用毒药杀害中共泸西县委组织部长张希先等同志未遂。他又曾勾结匪青年党骨干分子张正敏继续进行破坏活动，造谣惑众；嗣因张匪被捕，罗犯阴谋未逞。……（编者按：以下一段叙述凶犯罗时霖残害窦端孝同志的经过事实，从略。）
    以上事实经省人民检察署检察属实，提出公诉，要求处罪犯以极刑。
    查反革命分子罗时霖混入革命阵营后，屡次进行破坏，用各种阴狠手段杀害我革命干部，以达其反革命的破坏目的，卒使我优秀的革命青年被害身死，实属罪大恶极。为申国家法纪，维护人民利益，根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例第九条第四款将罗犯判处死刑，褫夺政治权利终身。现指定于一九五三年元月五日由泸西县人民政府召开群众大会公审执行。
                云南省人民法院副院长　曹理周
