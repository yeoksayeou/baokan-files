    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: "Pravda" published an article by its New York correspondent, Filipov, summarizing the discussions among American economists, business figures, and journalists regarding the new economic crisis in the United States. Filipov wrote:

    Most American bourgeois economists no longer discuss whether or not there will be an economic crisis; now, the questions they are debating are when the crisis will occur, how severe it will be after it occurs, and how long the crisis will last. Many economists and business figures cite the following signs to illustrate that the U.S. economy is ailing:

    1.  There is an imbalance between the production capacity and order volume of many industries. The most typical example is the steel industry. Currently, the steel industry is in danger of having to further reduce the operating rate of its production equipment. American newspapers predict that more than 100,000 steelworkers will lose their jobs.

    2.  Newspaper reports prove that other enterprises will also inevitably reduce their operating rates. Newspapers also report that in the automotive industry, machine tool manufacturing, mining, agricultural machinery manufacturing, and some other industries, many people will lose their jobs.

        In the last few months of 1952, orders in many manufacturing industries decreased significantly.

    3.  The quantity of unsold inventory is increasing. According to estimates in mid-December 1952, the value of manufactured goods piled up in wholesale and retail was $1 billion more than in the same period in 1951.

    4.  Credit sales have increased significantly. The amount of credit sales in recent months has been unprecedented. At the end of 1952, the total amount of credit sales was $2.6 billion more than at the end of 1951.

    5.  Wholesale prices are falling. In 1952, wholesale prices of meat, flour, corn, cotton, wool, and other agricultural raw materials and agricultural products all fell. Last December, wholesale prices of agricultural products were an average of 10 percent lower than at the beginning of 1951. At the beginning of 1953, wholesale prices further declined.

    6.  Retail business is contracting. According to official sources, retail business in the first ten months of last year was 3 percent higher than in the same period of the previous year. However, if the high prices are taken into account, the actual retail business decreased.

        Since the New Year, retail business has decreased even more. According to official figures, in the week ending on the 10th of this month, the sales of department stores decreased by 3 percent compared with the same period last year.

    7.  The amount of basic construction is decreasing. Some economists believe that in 1953, the amount of capital investment will decrease by an average of 10 percent compared with last year. According to these economists and some newspapers, in some sectors of industry, the funds used for new construction will be further reduced.

    8.  Exports are decreasing. Last year, the U.S. export trade had a significant drop. According to preliminary figures published in "The New York Times," the export volume of U.S. non-war materials in 1952 was 7 percent lower than in 1951.

    Filipov concluded that the more the U.S. ruling clique intensifies its arms expansion movement, the greater the distance between its expanding production potential and the shrinking purchasing power of the people. According to preliminary figures, they earned profits of $41 billion to $42 billion in 1952. At the same time, the prices of consumer goods further increased. The living standards of the working people further declined. Their purchasing power decreased. Even according to the figures published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, at the end of 1952, the income of American farmers had fallen to the lowest level in the last ten years (except for 1950). The U.S. Department of Agriculture's publication "Agricultural Income Situation" recently wrote that next year, the net income of farmers may decrease by at least another 5 percent.

    The future of American industrial workers and office workers is equally bleak.

    “真理报”记者论述美国经济情况日益恶化
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：“真理报”刊载该报驻纽约记者费利波夫的一篇文章，综论美国经济学家、工商界人士及新闻界关于美国新的经济危机的议论。费利波夫写道：
    美国资产阶级经济学家大部分已不再讨论有无经济危机的问题；现在他们所争论的问题是危机在什么时候发生、发生之后它的严重程度怎样及危机将存在多久的问题。很多经济学家及工商界人士举出下面的征象来说明美国经济有毛病：
    一、很多工业的生产能力和定货量之间不平衡。最典型的例子是钢铁工业。目前炼钢工业已有不得不进一步减低生产设备的开工率的危险。美国报纸预测将有十万余炼钢工人失业。
    二、报纸的报道证明还有其他企业也不可避免地要减低开工率。报纸并报道，在汽车业、工作母机制造业、采矿业、农业机器制造业及另外一些工业中，都将有很多人失业。
    一九五二年最后几个月中，许多制造工业中的定货都大大地减少了。
    三、卖不出去的存货的数量增加。据一九五二年十二月中旬的估计，批发和零售中积压的制造品的价值比一九五一年的同期增加十亿美元。
    四、赊账生意有显著增加。最近几月来赊账生意之大是从来没有过的。一九五二年年底赊账生意总额比一九五一年年底多二十六亿美元。
    五、批发价格下降。一九五二年，肉类、面粉、玉蜀黍、棉花、羊毛及其他农产原料和农产品的批发价格都有跌落。去年十二月，农产品的批发价格比一九五一年年初平均低百分之十。一九五三年年初，批发价格进一步下降。
    六、零售生意紧缩。据官方说，去年头十个月零售生意比上一年的同期高百分之三。但是，如果考虑到物价的高涨，就知道实际的零售生意是减低了。
    新年以来，零售生意更减少了。根据官方数字，到本月十日截止的这一星期内，百货公司的售货额比去年同期减少了百分之三。
    七、基本建设数量减少。有些经济学家认为，一九五三年内，资本投资数量将比去年平均减少百分之十。据这些经济学家及某些报纸说，工业方面的某些部门，用于新建设的经费将进一步减少。
    八、出口减低。去年内，美国出口贸易有显著的跌落。根据“纽约时报”刊载的初步数字，一九五二年美国非战争物资的出口额比一九五一年低百分之七。
    费利波夫总结说：美国统治集团愈是加紧扩军运动，它的扩张中的生产潜力和萎缩的人民购买力之间的距离便愈大。据初步数字来看，他们在一九五二年赚得了四百一十亿到四百二十亿美元的利润。同时，消费品的价格进一步增加。劳动人民的生活水准进一步降落。他们的购买力减低了。即使根据美国农业部公布的数字，一九五二年年终时，美国农民的收入已降落到最近十年来的最低水平（一九五零年除外）。美国农业部的机关刊物“农业收入情况”最近写道，明年，农民的纯收入可能至少还要减低百分之五。
    美国产业工人与机关职工的前途也同样恶劣。
