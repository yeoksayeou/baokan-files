    Jilin Wholesale Station Blindly Processes and Stockpiles Large Quantities of Inferior Socks
    The Jilin Regional Department Store Wholesale Station, disregarding the actual needs of consumers, blindly organized local knitting industries to process and produce socks, resulting in over 20,000 dozens of socks being stockpiled for six months to a year.
    The socks produced locally in Jilin are made of coarse yarn and are of poor quality. Local people now need fine-grid or linen socks. However, the Jilin Regional Department Store Wholesale Station did not recognize this change in people's lives and continued to organize local knitting industries to process large quantities of poor-quality socks. By the second quarter of last year, nearly 10,000 dozens of these poor-quality socks had already been stockpiled. The warehouse keepers urged for them to be allocated for distribution, but the allocation personnel were at a loss because they couldn't distribute them. The business section suggested to the processing section that if they couldn't produce good products, they should reduce the production of inferior products. However, the person in charge of the processing section said, "The processing plan was approved by the district company. Even if you don't want it, you still have to process it. This is a task!" They also said, "Factories don't have the conditions to change production, and reducing production would mean shutting down. Supporting production is also a task." In the third quarter, they continued to process over 18,000 dozens, but the city and county department stores didn't want a single pair (the city and county company warehouses were already stockpiling a lot). Thus, over 20,000 dozens of socks were stockpiled in the wholesale station's warehouse, occupying 800 million yuan of capital that couldn't be circulated.
    The socks processed locally in Jilin are not only of poor quality but also have high costs. Coarse-yarn socks with 140 needles have an allocation price of 38,000 yuan per dozen, and city and county companies have to sell them for over 4,000 yuan per pair, so they always remain unsold.
    The Commercial Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered the phenomenon of the wholesale station stockpiling socks. In addition to instructing the wholesale station to revise the processing plan, it emphasized that in the future, producers should improve the quality and specifications of products according to the needs of consumers. The Jilin Municipal State-Owned Knitting Factory has now installed a new machine to produce 6,000 dozens of cotton socks according to residents' winter needs. At the same time, it is also preparing to install equipment for producing mercerized socks to produce high-quality socks. (Li Jiyao)

### 吉林批发站盲目加工积压了大批次等袜子

    吉林批发站盲目加工积压了大批次等袜子
    吉林地区百货批发站不依照消费者的实际需要，盲目地组织本地针织业加工生产，使两万多打袜子积压了半年至一年。
    吉林本地生产的袜子都是粗线的，质量较次。当地群众现在需要的是细格线或是麻纱袜子。但是，吉林地区百货批发站并没看见群众生活的这种变化，仍然组织本地针织业加工了大批质量很次的袜子。这些质量次的袜子，在去年第二季度已经积压了近万打。保管员催着调拨出库，调拨员因为分拨不出去而束手无策。业务股向加工股提出意见：不能生产好的就应减少次品的生产。而加工股的负责人员却说：“加工计划是区公司批准了的，你不要，也得加工，这是任务！”又说：“改产工厂没条件，减产要停业，扶植生产也是任务。”第三季度继续加工了一万八千多打，但市县百货公司一双也不要（市县公司仓库里也已积压了很多），两万多打袜子就这样积压在批发站仓库里，占用了八亿元的资金不能周转。
    吉林本地加工出来的袜子不但质量次，而且成本高。一百四十针的粗线袜子调拨价三万八千元一打，市县公司售价要四千多元一双，总是卖不出去。
    中共吉林省委商业部发现了该批发站积压袜子的现象，除指示该批发站修改加工计划外，并强调今后生产者要按照消费者的需要，改进产品的质量规格。吉林市地方国营针织厂现已新装了一台机器，按照居民冬季的需要生产棉毛袜子六千打。同时还准备安设生产丝光袜子的设备，生产质量好的袜子。　（李继尧）
