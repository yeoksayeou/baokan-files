    Tianjin Railway Administration
    Formulates Methods to Improve Design Work

    In order to accelerate the preparatory work for capital construction, the Tianjin Railway Administration, based on the principle of unified allocation and centralized use of technical personnel, has transferred more than 20 technical personnel (including engineers, technicians, and draftsmen) from its subordinate sections, offices, and transportation sub-bureaus to strengthen the design institutions and quickly put them into design work. It has also formulated four methods to improve design work: First, strengthen work planning and implement rhythmic design work according to indicated charts. The Capital Construction Office, Construction Office, and various business offices of the administration will first carry out project prioritization according to the degree of importance and urgency. Then, the Design Section will formulate quarterly and monthly design plans and work progress schedules for each specific project based on the project prioritization, intersperse and allocate design forces, implement rhythmic design according to indicated charts, and conduct regular inspections to solve problems in a timely manner. Second, implement scientific division of design labor. Scientifically organize the division of labor and rationally use manpower based on each person's work ability and expertise. Engineers should only do preliminary design, technical design, stress analysis, and other work. Semi-technical or non-technical work such as drawing, preparing budgets, tracing, and copying should be assigned to technicians, draftsmen, and apprentices as much as possible. This will enable everyone to maximize their work effectiveness. Third, adopt standard designs to reduce design duplication and improve design work efficiency. In early January this year, the design sections of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan Railway Administrations held a joint meeting in Tianjin, and tentatively determined that 95 projects could adopt standardized designs, of which only 16 were assigned to the Tianjin Railway Administration for design. Due to the cooperation of the design sections of the three railway administrations, the workload of each unit can be greatly reduced. Fourth, prepare labor and material quotas and unit price analyses in advance. For example, how much labor is required to make a certain type of window; how much wood is required per square meter to lay a certain type of floor; how much rebar and cement is required per square meter to repair a certain type of wall; and the unit prices of these wood, rebar, and cement should all be listed in advance. When preparing a detailed budget, many calculation procedures can be saved. The design personnel of the administration are determined to complete the annual design tasks before the end of June.

    天津铁路管理局
    订办法改进设计工作
    天津铁路管理局为了加紧进行基本建设的准备工作，根据技术人员统一调配、集中使用的原则，已从所属各段、处及运输分局等单位抽调了二十多名技术人员（包括工程师、技术员、绘图员），充实了设计机构，迅速投入设计工作，并订出了改进设计工作的四点办法：一、加强工作计划性，按指示图表实行有节奏的设计工作。该局所属基本建设处、施工处、各业务处，首先按照轻重缓急，共同进行工程排队，然后由设计科根据工程排队订出每季、每月的设计计划及每一具体对象的工作进度表，穿插配备设计力量，按指示图表实行有节奏的设计，经常检查，及时解决问题。二、实行科学的设计分工。根据每个人的工作能力、特长，科学地组织分工，合理使用人力。工程师只做初步设计、技术设计、应力分析等项工作，关于绘图、编造预算、描图、抄写等半技术性或非技术性的工作，尽量交给技术员、绘图员和练习生去做。这样就可以使每一个人都能发挥他的工作效能。三、采用标准设计，减少设计重复，提高设计工作效率。今年一月初，北京、天津、太原三个铁路管理局设计科在天津召开了一次联席会，拟定可以采用定型设计的工程有九十五件，其中分配给天津铁路管理局设计的仅十六件。由于三个铁路管理局设计科的合作，就可以大大减少各单位的工作量。四、提前编制工料定额及单价分析。如做一个某种类型的窗子，需要几个人工；铺某种类型的地板，每平方公尺需要若干木材；修某种墙壁，每平方公尺需要若干钢筋洋灰，以及这些木材、钢筋、洋灰单价若干，都事先列表载明，待编制详细预算时，就可以省去很多计算手续。该局设计人员决心在六月底以前完成全年设计任务。
