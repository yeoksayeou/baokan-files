According to American news agencies, American air bandits, piloting planes riddled with holes, would say upon "luckily" returning to the airport, "The sky north of Jinhua is terrifying!"

On the ground beneath that sky north of Jinhua, which struck terror into the American air pirates, Chinese People's Volunteer Army trucks laden with ammunition, pack animals carrying ammunition, entire transport teams, and stretcher-bearers tirelessly traveled day and night on the roads leading from the rear to the Shangganling front.

This is a new situation on the Korean battlefield. This new situation was created by the heroic anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Since Van Fleet recklessly launched the so-called "Jinhua Offensive," American air bandits, in order to coordinate with the ground offensive, dispatched an average of more than 70 sorties per day to indiscriminately bomb the Shangganling area,妄想妄想切断妄想切断我军的运输线和摧毁我军的炮兵和步兵阵地。妄想切断我军的运输线和摧毁我军的炮兵和步兵阵地。
But the Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft artillery units had already laid down a dense network of anti-air fire in the high mountains and deep valleys of this area. From October 14th to November 25th of last year, in just over 40 days, they shot down or damaged 274 enemy aircraft in this narrow area, causing the American Air Force to suffer a tragic defeat just like its ground forces.

The anti-air battle at Shangganling was extremely fierce. The anti-aircraft gunners had to engage in intense combat not only with enemy aircraft but also with enemy artillery at the same time. They defeated the enemy in such battles with the greatest courage and outstanding combat skills.

On October 20th, our powerful artillery was fiercely bombarding the enemy's positions when a large number of enemy planes flew in. The enemy's air force and artillery simultaneously launched a frantic bombardment of our artillery positions and anti-aircraft artillery positions. Thus, an extremely fierce battle unfolded between the enemy and us.

Enemy shells exploded around the anti-aircraft artillery positions, dust flew on the positions, and gravel and shrapnel hit the gunners. But these brave soldiers did not leave their anti-aircraft guns for a moment. They put on the steel helmets that had been blown off by the blast of the shells and fired fiercely at the enemy planes. Some gunners were buried in the collapsed fortifications. As soon as they were pulled out, they immediately climbed back onto the gun platform to continue fighting when they heard the sound of enemy planes.

Dense anti-aircraft fire forced enemy planes to avoid low-altitude bombing, and our various calibers of artillery continued to bombard the enemy's infantry units non-stop.

The American air bandits were enraged and, following the target indicated by the enemy artillery smoke shells, swooped down on the anti-aircraft artillery positions. At this moment, Deputy Squad Leader Wang Zhenghai was about to fire, but a bomb exploded next to his gun, and shrapnel hit his head. He sacrificed himself, but his hands were still tightly gripping the steering gear, his foot was on the firing pedal, and his eyes were staring fiercely at the enemy in the sky. Second Gunner Wang Jiuzhou immediately carried this fallen comrade to the shelter, then immediately returned to the gun, clenched his fist, and raised it to the sky, saying, "Fire, avenge the deputy squad leader!" Ammunition Handler He Youde immediately jumped into Wang Zhenghai's position and opened fire fiercely at the enemy planes again. At this moment, an enemy plane swooped down again and was hit by a shell fired by He Youde.

On this day, three enemy planes were shot down or damaged on this position alone. After this, the anti-aircraft gun that Martyr Wang Zhenghai had been assigned to while alive shot down or damaged two enemy planes each in four days.

In the high mountains of the Shangganling front, various anti-air warfare weapons were scattered, including the most powerful anti-aircraft guns, small anti-aircraft guns, and many anti-aircraft machine guns, forming a tight network of fire that made it a dead end for enemy planes no matter where they tried to escape.

One day, an enemy artillery spotting plane was flying at an altitude of over 5,000 meters, out of range of the small anti-aircraft guns. Suddenly, the most powerful anti-aircraft gun on the hilltop "spoke" and shot down the spotting plane.

Later, the enemy's artillery spotting planes dared not easily intrude into the "terrifying sky" north of Jinhua. The enemy artillery, with the spotting plane as its eyes, became blind from then on, and its firing became extremely inaccurate.

On October 30th, our army recovered "Red Mountain Top" – the entire ground position of the high ground on the right side of Shangganling, north of Jinhua. Then the enemy launched a frantic offensive against this position.

Our artillery units immediately launched a fierce bombardment of the enemy. At that time, the enemy sent sixteen light bombers to bomb our artillery positions.

But as soon as the enemy planes flew into the airspace above our positions, fierce anti-aircraft fire erupted from all directions, and the shell bursts in the sky, like white flowers, surrounded the enemy planes.

The first enemy plane, before it could even swoop down on the target, hurriedly dropped its bombs and fled for its life. The second was shot down as soon as it entered the fire net. The third enemy plane was about to turn around and escape, but another shell happened to meet it on its way.

Deputy Squad Leader Liu Jingwu and Communications Officer Wang Shenggui rushed to the place where the enemy plane fell and saw that the plane was burning, and the pilot had fallen to his death beside the plane. They picked up the pilot's copper helmet and a parachute and brought them back.

On this day, they shot down a total of three enemy planes and damaged four.

At that time, the homeland people's慰问團visiting group was conducting a慰问visit on the front lines. In order to thank the people of the motherland for donating the anti-aircraft guns to them, the Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft gunners entrusted the visiting group to bring the American pilot's copper helmet back to the motherland as a gift to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland.

Under the heavy blows of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army anti-aircraft artillery units, the American air bandits painstakingly came up with a way to escape for their lives. Each time they flew from high altitude to the north of the anti-aircraft artillery positions, then swooped down from north to south, so that if the plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, it could use its final gliding force to fly back to its own positions. But this "clever" method was rendered useless by the enormous destructive power of our anti-aircraft shells. Most of the hit enemy planes fell before they could fly to their own positions, some pilots fell to their deaths on the cliffs, and some were pierced through the stomach by treetops and hung on the trees on the hillside.

Our heroic anti-aircraft gunners greatly despised the enemy. On the afternoon of November 22nd, before the sun had set, the gunners had just happily finished eating dumplings when four enemy jet fighters came again. The gunners smiled and said, "You've come at a good time. Have some ‘canned goods’!" They immediately jumped onto the gun platform to prepare for battle.

The enemy artillery fired a smoke shell to indicate the target, and the enemy planes began to swoop down. However, the first enemy plane was shot down by dense shells on the front lines of our infantry positions. As the second enemy plane swooped down, Squad Leader Xi Guichen stepped on the firing pedal, and three out of five shells hit the enemy plane. The two enemy planes behind were so frightened that they hurriedly dropped their bombs and turned around and fled south.

This enemy plane, having eaten three tubes of "canned goods," exploded on the spot in the air. In a flash of light, the entire plane instantly turned into countless fragments, falling like autumn leaves. Passing transport team members were all happy and shouted, "So powerful! One big plane gave birth to dozens of small planes!"

The wreckage of this enemy plane landed near the anti-aircraft artillery position, and the pilot was blasted with a scorched head and face, looking inhuman. He wore a copper plate on his chest, engraved with the name of this robber: Robert James, military number 1911049.

The heroic anti-aircraft artillery units made a significant contribution to the victory of the Shangganling campaign. The anti-aircraft gunners believe that America's "air superiority" should now be called "air force worry to death."

### 上甘岭前线对空作战的胜利

    上甘岭前线对空作战的胜利
    新华社记者  李翼振
    据美国通讯社报道，美国空中强盗驾驶着弹穴累累的飞机“幸运地”回到机场时，一跳下飞机就说：“金化以北的天空可怕极了！”
    就在使美国空军强盗丧胆的金化以北的天空底下的地面上，中国人民志愿军满载着弹药的汽车，驮着弹药的牲口、整批的运输队和担架队，昼夜不息地往返于由后方通向上甘岭前线的公路上。
    这是朝鲜战场上的一个新情况。这个新情况是中国人民志愿军英勇的高射炮部队创造出来的。
    自从范佛里特冒险发动所谓“金化攻势”以后，美国空中强盗为了配合地面进攻，平均每天出动飞机七十多架次滥施轰炸上甘岭地区，妄想切断我军的运输线和摧毁我军的炮兵和步兵阵地。
    但是志愿军的高射炮部队早在这一带的高山深谷间布下了密密层层的对空射击的火网。他们在去年十月十四日到十一月二十五日的四十多天中，就在这一狭小的地区击落击伤了二百七十四架敌机，使美国空军和它的地面部队一样地遭到了极其悲惨的失败。
    上甘岭的对空战斗是非常激烈的。高射炮手们不但要和敌机作紧张的战斗，而且同时还要和敌人的炮兵作战。他们在这样的战斗中用最大的勇敢精神和杰出的战斗技巧打败了敌人。
    十月二十日的那一天，我军强大的炮兵正向敌人阵地猛烈轰击，大批的敌机飞来了。敌人的空军和炮兵同时向我炮兵阵地和高射炮阵地进行疯狂的轰击。于是敌我双方展开了一场极其猛烈的战斗。
    高射炮阵地周围爆炸着敌人打过来的炮弹，阵地上尘土飞扬，碎石子和弹片打在炮手们的身上。但是这些勇敢的战士一刻也不离开他们的高射炮，他们戴上被炮弹爆炸的气浪掀去的钢盔，向着敌机猛烈射击。有的炮手被压在炸塌的工事里，当他们刚被别人从那里拉出来，一听见敌机的响声，立即又爬上炮盘继续战斗。
    密集的高射炮火迫使敌机不敢低空轰炸，我军各种口径的大炮仍然不停地轰击着敌人的步兵部队。
    美国空中强盗恼羞成怒了，朝着敌炮烟幕弹指示的目标向着高射炮阵地俯冲下来。这时，一炮手副班长王正海正要发射，炸弹却在他的炮旁爆炸了，弹片击中了他的头部。他牺牲了，但他两手仍然紧握着方向转动机，脚踏在发火机上，两眼狠狠地仰望着天空中的仇敌。二炮手王九洲马上把这位至死不倒的战友背到掩蔽部里，然后马上回到炮上，握紧拳头对着空中一扬说：“打，替副班长报仇！”弹药手何有德立刻跳上王正海的位置，又向敌机猛烈开火。这时有一架敌机再次俯冲下来，正好被何有德打上去的炮弹击中了。
    这一天仅在这个阵地上就击落击伤了三架敌机。在这以后，王正海烈士生前所在的那门高射炮，在
    四天中击落击伤了敌机各两架。
    在上甘岭前线的高山峻岭间，散布着各种对空作
    战的武器，有最大威力的高射炮、小型的高射炮和许许多多高射机关枪，它们组成了严密的火网，使敌机逃东逃西都是死路。
    有一天，一架敌人的炮兵校正机在五千多公尺高空飞行，小型的高射炮打不着它，突然山顶上威力最大的高射炮“发言”了，一下就把这架校正机打了下来。
    到后来，敌人的炮兵校正机再也不敢轻易地侵入金化以北“可怕的天空”了。把校正机当作眼睛的敌人炮兵从此变成瞎子，发射就极不准确了。
    十月三十日，我军收复了“红山顶”——金化以北上甘岭右侧的高地的全部地面阵地，接着敌人又向这个阵地发动了疯狂的进攻。
    我军炮兵部队立即向敌人进行猛烈轰击。当时敌人就用十六架轻轰炸机飞来轰炸我军的炮兵阵地。
    但当敌机刚刚飞进我军阵地的上空时，四面八方马上发出了猛烈的高射炮火，在天空中爆炸开来的像一朵朵白花似的弹烟把敌机包围起来了。
    头一架敌机还没有俯冲到目标上空就慌张地把炸弹丢掉逃命。第二架刚进入火网就被打了下来。第三架敌机正想扭头逃跑，可是另一颗炮弹正好在它的去路上和它碰上了头。
    副班长刘景午和通讯员王生贵飞奔到敌机落下的地方一看，飞机正在燃烧，驾驶员跌死在飞机旁边。他们就拾了一顶驾驶员的铜壳帽子和一顶降落伞回来。
    这一天，他们共打落了三架敌机、打伤了四架敌机。
    当时祖国人民慰问团正在前线进行慰问。志愿军的高射炮手们为了感谢祖国人民捐献给他们的高射炮，就把那顶美国驾驶员的铜壳帽托慰问团带回祖国，作为向毛主席和祖国人民的献礼。
    在中国人民志愿军高射炮部队的惨重打击下，美国空中强盗们煞费苦心地想出了一种逃命的办法。他们每一次从高空飞到高射炮阵地的北方，然后从北向南俯冲，这样如果飞机被高射炮火击中，就可利用最后的滑翔力飞回到他们自己的阵地上去。可是这个“聪明”的办法由于我军高射炮弹的巨大破坏力而失去了作用，被击中的敌机大多还没有飞到自己阵地就落了下来，有的驾驶员跌死在山岩上，有的被树梢戳穿肚皮挂在半山的树上。
    我军英勇的高射炮手们十分蔑视敌人。十一月二十二日下午，太阳还没有落山，炮手们刚高高兴兴地吃罢饺子，又来了四架敌人的喷气式战斗机，炮手们笑着说：“来得真好，请你吃‘罐头’！”他们立即跳上炮盘准备作战。
    敌炮打来一发烟幕弹指示目标，敌机就开始俯冲了。但是，第一架敌机就被密集的炮弹击落在我军步兵阵地的前沿。第二架敌机刚向下俯冲，班长郗贵臣一踏火，五发炮弹就有三发和敌机碰上了头。后面二架敌机吓得连忙扔掉炸弹，回过头去一直向
    南逃走了。
    这架吃了三筒“罐头”的敌机，当场在空中爆炸，火光一闪，整个飞机瞬时变成无数的碎片，像秋天树叶一样的纷纷地落了下来。过路的运输队员都乐得个个喊好：“好厉害呀！一个大飞机生下好几十个小飞机啦！”
    这架敌机的残骸就落在高射炮阵地附近，驾驶员被炸得焦头烂额，不像人样子了。他的胸前挂着一
    块铜牌，刻着这个强盗的姓名：劳伯·詹姆斯，军
    号一九一一零四九。
    英勇的高射炮部队对上甘岭战役的胜利作了重大
    的贡献。高射炮手们认为美国的“空军优势”现在
    应该叫做“空军忧死”了。
