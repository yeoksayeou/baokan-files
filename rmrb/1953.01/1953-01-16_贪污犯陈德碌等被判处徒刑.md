    Corrupt Officials Chen Delu and Others Sentenced to Imprisonment
    Editor: The Qian County People's Court of Shaanxi Province recently held a sentencing rally of over a thousand people to deal with corrupt elements, sentencing corrupt elements such as Chen Delu to imprisonment in accordance with the spirit of "leniency in the past, strictness in the future." Chen Delu joined the work of the cooperative in the Ninth District of the county in April of last year and began embezzling in May. Until August, he used despicable means such as issuing false receipts and giving farmers less money when purchasing wheat, embezzling a total of 720,000 yuan. The criminal Chen even used these embezzled funds to seduce three women. Another corrupt element, Zhang Wenhua, joined the Guantou District Cooperative in the county in July of last year. In less than fifteen days, he used methods such as using large scales when purchasing wheat and issuing false receipts to embezzle four times, totaling 380 jin of wheat, equivalent to about 300,000 yuan. There was also elementary school teacher Su Zhenhai, a landlord by class background, who had a close relationship with Zhang Wenhua. When Zhang told Su Zhenhai that he had used large scales to purchase more than 200 jin of wheat, Su not only did not stop him or report it to the People's Government, but instead said to Zhang, "You don't have any clothes; you can sell the extra wheat to make clothes." Finally, the two colluded to embezzle: Su Zhenhai was responsible for issuing false receipts, and Zhang promised to share the embezzled money. Although the amount of embezzled money by the above three criminals was not large, the circumstances were egregious. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of "leniency in the past, strictness in the future," Chen Delu was sentenced to two years of imprisonment; Zhang Wenhua to one year of imprisonment; and Su Zhenhai, although his embezzled money had not yet been obtained, already had the idea and behavior of embezzlement, and showed no remorse during the trial, so he was also sentenced to one year of imprisonment.　Wang Debo

    贪污犯陈德碌等被判处徒刑
    编辑同志：陕西省乾县人民法院于不久前召开了一个一千多人的处理贪污分子的宣判大会，根据“过去从宽，今后从严”的精神，判处贪污分子陈德碌等徒刑。陈德碌去年四月参加该县第九区合作社工作，五月开始贪污，直到八月，先后四次以开假条，收购小麦少给农民钱等卑鄙手段，共贪污七十二万元。陈犯曾经用这些赃款诱奸了三个女人。另一贪污分子张文华，去年七月参加该县关头区合作社工作，不到十五天，用收购麦子时使用大称、开假条等办法先后贪污四次，共得三百八十斤麦子，约合三十万元。还有小学教师苏振海，地主成份，和张文华关系密切。当张犯把已用大称收购二百多斤麦子的事告诉苏振海时，苏不但不加阻止或反映给人民政府，反向张说：“你没有衣服，长下的麦子卖了就可以缝衣服。”最后，二人合谋贪污：苏振海负责开假条，张犯言定分给赃款。上述三犯，贪污赃款虽不多，但情节恶劣。所以根据“过去从宽，今后从严”的原则，判处陈德碌徒刑二年；张文华徒刑一年；对苏振海，其赃款虽未到手，但已经有了贪污的思想和行为，且在审讯中无悔过诚意，所以也判处徒刑一年。　王德博
