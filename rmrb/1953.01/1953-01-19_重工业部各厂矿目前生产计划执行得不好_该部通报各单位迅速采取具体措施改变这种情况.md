The execution of production plans in factories and mines under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry is currently very poor. On the 10th of this month, the ministry issued a circular demanding that all bureaus, factories, and mines swiftly change this situation.

According to the Ministry's December 1952 Daily Output Report, the completion of production plans was very poor. Of the 21 major products, only 11 fulfilled their plans, while 10 failed to do so. For example, iron concentrate only completed 85.7% of the monthly plan, steel 90.2%, coke 92.8%, ammonium sulfate 70.1%, synthetic ammonia 56.2%, sulfuric acid 91%, copper 93.9%, aluminum 91.7%, zinc 72.8%, and cement 87.7%. At the same time, among the products that did meet their plans, there were serious shortcomings in the balance of production. For example, in the production of flat glass at the Northeast No. 1 Glass Factory, if the average daily output in the first ten days of the month is taken as 100, then the middle ten days were 120 and the last ten days were 170. In the production of steel at Anshan Iron and Steel, the first ten days were 100, the middle ten days decreased to 96.7%, and the last ten days increased to 120. For electric furnace steel ingots at Taiyuan Iron and Steel, the first ten days were 100, the middle ten days were 124, and the last ten days were 154.

Another serious situation in production at the end of last year was the increase in production accidents. For example, at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, No. 2 blast furnace had dozens of serious grate hanging and explosion accidents starting from December 11th, and had not resumed iron tapping by January 7th. Yangquan No. 2 and No. 3 blast furnaces had grate furnace accidents starting from December 5th and only resumed on December 24th. At the Dalian Chemical Plant, the crankshaft of No. 1 raw material compressor broke on November 26th and has not yet been repaired, seriously affecting the production of synthetic ammonia.

This situation has not improved in January of this year. As of January 5th, according to the normal production progress, each product should have completed 16.5% of the monthly plan, but the actual situation is that the numbers completed for many products are far from the normal progress. For example, molybdenum concentrate only completed 5.4%, zinc completed 1.04%, and caustic soda completed 7.3%.

The Ministry pointed out in the circular that in order to ensure the completion of this year's production tasks, it is necessary to first ensure the completion of the production plan for the first month of the year, so as to lay a foundation for the whole year's production. According to past experience, the production situation in January and February of each year is often in an abnormal state. On the one hand, it is easy to have a general relaxation of production around the New Year and Spring Festival; on the other hand, because of rushing to complete tasks and shock production before the New Year, there are many accidents and no preparations are made for the beginning of the year's production, resulting in a decline in production. This year is the same as in previous years, and the above-mentioned situation has already begun to appear. Therefore, the leading cadres of enterprises at all levels must pay attention to this and quickly take effective measures to establish the view that "the state plan is the law" and "safe production," ensure balanced production, and strive to complete the plan daily, monthly, and quarterly.

The circular further pointed out that in order to ensure the completion of the 1953 state plan, the following work must be personally attended to by the factory (mine) director or deputy factory (mine) director:

	One, check the reserve status of raw materials, auxiliary materials, and semi-finished products to ensure timely supply of raw materials to avoid work stoppages waiting for materials.
	Two, check the equipment status, carry out necessary repairs in a timely manner, and strictly prevent the occurrence of production accidents.
	Three, check and overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible in production, in order to ensure the daily completion of the production plan.
	Four, enterprises with a certain foundation in production management should promote operation according to instruction charts and organize balanced production.
	Five, educate employees to strictly abide by labor discipline, and take concrete measures to ensure that attendance rates and labor productivity continue to rise.

### 重工业部各厂矿目前生产计划执行得不好  该部通报各单位迅速采取具体措施改变这种情况

    重工业部各厂矿目前生产计划执行得不好
    该部通报各单位迅速采取具体措施改变这种情况
    中央重工业部所属各厂矿目前对生产计划的执行情况很不好，本月十日该部特发布通报，要求各局及各厂矿迅速改变这一情况。
    根据该部一九五二年十二月份产量日报的统计，生产计划完成的情况很不好，二十一种主要产品中完成计划的只有十一种，没有完成计划的有十种。如铁富矿只完成月计划的百分之八十五点七，钢材百分之九十点二，焦炭百分之九十二点八，硫铵百分之七十点一，合成氨百分之五十六点二，硫酸百分之九十一，铜百分之九十三点九，铝百分之九十一点七，锌百分之七十二点八，水泥百分之八十七点七。同时在完成了计划的几种产品中，生产的均衡性也有严重的缺点。东北第一玻璃厂平板玻璃的生产，如以上旬平均日产量作为一百，则中旬为一百二十，下旬为一百七十。鞍钢钢材的生产上旬为一百，中旬减至百分之九十六点七，下旬又增至一百二十。太原电炉钢锭上旬为一百，中旬为一百二十四，下旬则为一百五十四。
    去年年底生产中的另一严重情况是生产事故增多。如太原钢铁厂二号交炉自十二月十一日起发生严重栅挂、爆炸事故数十次，至一月七日止仍未恢复出铁。阳泉二、三号高炉，自十二月五日起发生栅炉事故，迄十二月二十四日始恢复。大连化学厂自十一月二十六日起，一号原料压缩机曲轴裂断，至今仍未恢复，严重地影响了合成氨的生产。
    至今年一月，这种情况并未好转。截至一月五日止，按正常的生产进度，每种产品都应完成月计划的百分之一百六十五，但实际情况是许多产品完成的数字与正常进度相差很多，如钼精矿只完成百分之五十四，锌完成百分之十点四，烧碱完成百分之七点三。
    该部在通报中指出，为了保证今年生产任务的完成，必须首先保证完成一年开始的第一个月的生产计划，以便为全年生产打下基础。根据以往几年经验：每年一、二月份生产情况经常处于不正常状态。一方面是因为在新年和春节前后，容易发生普遍的生产松懈现象；另一方面则因为年前赶任务，突击生产，所以事故繁多，没有做好年初生产的准备工作，以致生产下降。今年和往年相同，已开始出现了上述情况。因此必须引起各级企业领导干部注意，迅速采取有效措施，树立“国家计划就是法律”和“安全生产”的观点，保证均衡生产，争取逐日、逐月、逐季完成计划。
    通报继又指出，为了保证完成一九五三年的国家计划，在目前须由厂（矿）长或副厂（矿）长亲自注意下列工作：
    一、检查原材料、辅助材料、半成品的储备状况，保证原材料及时供应，以免停工待料。
    二、检查设备情况，及时加以必要的检修，严防生产事故的发生。
    三、检查与克服生产中无人负责现象，以保证逐日完成生产计划。
    四、凡生产管理有一定基础的企业，应推行按指示图表作业，组织均衡生产。
    五、教育职工严格遵守劳动纪律，并采取具体措施，保证出勤率及劳动生产率不断上涨。
