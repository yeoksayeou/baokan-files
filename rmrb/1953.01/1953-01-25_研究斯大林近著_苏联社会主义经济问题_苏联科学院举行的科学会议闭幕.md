    Xinhua News Agency, January 24th, Moscow Dispatch: The scientific conference on Stalin's recent work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," held by the Department of Economics and Law and the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow on the 7th, closed on the 10th.
    During the four days of the conference, attendees listened to twelve reports and organized sixteen discussions. They discussed the nature of socialist economic laws and Comrade Stalin's discoveries and arguments on the basic economic law of socialism and the basic economic law of modern capitalism, and on socialist commodity production and the law of value. Three reports discussed the transition from socialism to communism. Attendees enthusiastically exchanged views, and some questions arising from the study of Stalin's brilliant work were raised in the reports and discussions. This helped everyone to understand its basic principles more deeply.
    The meeting pointed out the shortcomings in the work of the Institute of Economics and the "Economic Problems" magazine, and criticized some economists' subjective and idealistic errors. The meeting criticized the authors of certain articles who, after the publication of Comrade Stalin's works, remained silent about their serious mistakes in political economy. The meeting determined the urgent tasks of various scientific research works of the Institute of Economics, and suggested that the Institute of Economics pay attention to extensively studying the problems arising from the study of Stalin's brilliant works, deeply explore the essence of the phenomena it studies, conduct large-scale research work on socialist economics, and study the problems of modern capitalism arising from the disintegration of the unified world market and the deepening of the crisis of the world capitalist system.
    The conference was closed by K. V. Ostrovityanov, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Director of the Institute of Economics, who summarized the work of the conference and talked about the shortcomings in the reports and speeches. He particularly criticized the ambiguities in the report of Academician V. S. Nemchinov.

    苏联科学院举行的科学会议闭幕
    【新华社二十四日讯】莫斯科消息：七日在莫斯科举行的苏联科学院经济与法律部和经济研究所关于斯大林近著“苏联社会主义经济问题”的科学会议，已于十日闭幕。
    在会议进行的四天内，到会者听取了十二个报告，组织了十六次讨论。他们讨论了社会主义经济法则的性质和斯大林同志关于社会主义基本经济法则和现代资本主义基本经济法则、关于社会主义商品生产和价值法则等问题的发现和论证。有三个报告论述由社会主义过渡到共产主义的问题。到会者热烈交换了意见，在报告和讨论中提出了一些由于研究斯大林的天才著作而产生的问题。这帮助了大家更深刻地理解它的基本原理。
    会上指出了经济研究所和“经济问题”杂志工作中的缺点，并对一些经济学家的主观和唯心的错误展开了批评和自我批评。会议批评了某些文章的作者，他们在斯大林同志的著作发表后，对自己在政治经济学方面的严重错误还默不作声。会议确定了经济研究所各种科学研究工作的迫切任务，并建议经济研究所注意去广泛地研究由于研讨斯大林的天才著作而产生的问题，深入地探讨其所研究的现象的本质，对社会主义经济学进行大规模的研究工作，研究由于统一的世界市场的瓦解、世界资本主义体系危机的加深而产生的现代资本主义的问题。
    会议由苏联科学院通讯院士、经济研究所所长康·维·奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫致闭幕词，他就会议工作作了总结，并谈到了报告和发言中的缺点。他特别批评了瓦·斯·涅姆钦诺夫院士的报告中不明确的地方。
