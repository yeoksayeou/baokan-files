We Peasants Must Strive for the Overall Goal of Industrialization
Qu Yaoli

The cotton my mutual aid team and I planted has achieved high yields for three consecutive years. These three years of high-yield experience have made me realize that industrialization is crucial for developing agricultural production. Without the support of industry and the help of our worker brothers, I could not have achieved high yields for three consecutive years, nor could I strive for even higher yields in the future. In 1950, I had two mu of cotton, with an average yield of 745 jin per mu. That year was a good year, and some people in our village even harvested 600 to 700 jin per mu. 1951 was different. Those who harvested 600 to 700 jin per mu dropped to 300 to 400 jin, but my two mu of high-yield cotton land created a new national record of an average of 912 jin of cotton per mu. Why this change? In a word, it was thanks to the worker brothers. In 1951, our mutual aid team bought two new-style walking plows and two Liberation-style waterwheels. I had never seen the new-style walking plow before, and people in the village were reluctant to use it. However, I believed in the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and I knew that the furniture made by the worker brothers for us would not break. I was the first to use it. It plowed deeper, flatter, and faster. The soil was loose, so the cotton was not afraid of drought. The Liberation-style waterwheel weighed only a little over 200 jin, which was two-thirds lighter than the old-style waterwheel, making it very convenient to carry around. Our mutual aid team used it to irrigate 20 mu of paddy fields back and forth, and it was very effective, so there was no drought. These two treasures became the guarantee of high yields, helping me create a new national cotton high-yield record and earn a reward from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. The team members recognized the benefits of new-style farm tools and were very fond of the two new-style walking plows awarded to us by the government. They also bought another waterwheel. Under the influence of our mutual aid team, the whole village bought more than 50 new-style walking plows and 70 waterwheels, and everyone's production improved. This year, we encountered four major disasters: drought, flood, insects, and frost. Especially in July, we successively encountered 13 kinds of insect pests, such as cotton bollworms, corn earworms, blind bugs, and measuring worms, which came in large numbers and ate the cotton bolls one by one, causing people both heartache and anxiety. Fortunately, we had sprayers and medicines manufactured by our worker brothers. We mobilized 32 people to go to the fields. Within four days, we universally treated 22 mu of cotton fields two to four times, spraying more than 11,000 jin of pesticide made of "1605" and "DDT." Although we started late, and each cotton plant had already lost an average of five and a half peaches, we finally extinguished the insect pests and still achieved a high yield. My nine mu of high-yield land averaged 816 jin of cotton per mu. I can't remember if it was 1944 or 1945, but after a year of hard work, just as the cotton was about to be harvested, we suddenly encountered a disaster, and in the end, we didn't even harvest 30 or 50 jin. The disaster in 1952 was even more serious than that year. Without the support of our worker brothers, how could we have achieved a high yield? Now, our mutual aid team has developed into an agricultural production cooperative, and we have more new-style farm tools: waterwheels, walking plows, sprayers, as well as new-style drills, straw cutters, and corn threshers. In addition, there are sewing machines specially designed to solve difficulties for women. However, this is still far from enough. We must step up production and construction to realize the country's industrialization as soon as possible. By then, plowing will be done with machines, harvesting will be done with machines, and even picking cotton will be done with machines, so that we can truly achieve high yields every year, and even higher yields year after year.

At the Provincial Agricultural High-Yield Labor Model Representative Conference in Shanxi Province before the New Year, Wu Chunan from Yicheng, Yao Wenzhang from Jiangxian, Liu Haiyue from Yuxian and I jointly challenged all cotton high-yield models and all cotton-growing brothers in the province, guaranteeing that the area of high-yield paddy cotton land in 1953 would be three times larger than in 1952, with an average yield of 1,000 to 1,150 jin per mu; the area of dry land would be more than doubled, with an average yield of 550 to 1,000 jin per mu; and we also guarantee to lead the cotton production increase in the village by 30% to 35%, and the cotton production increase in the nearby 34 administrative villages by 20% to 30%. Producing one more jin of cotton is adding one more share of construction power to the country. The time for national industrialization and collectivization and mechanization will come sooner. 1953 is the first year of our motherland's Five-Year Construction Plan. All of us peasants must strive to achieve the overall goal of industrialization. (Written by Wu Xiang)

    我们农民要为工业化的总目标努力

    我和我们互助组种的棉花，已经连着三年获得了高额丰产。这三年丰产的经验，使我认识工业化对发展农业生产实在太重要了。如果没有工业的支援，没有工人老大哥的帮助，我决不能连着三年得到高额丰产，更不能在今后争取更高的丰产。一九五○年我有两亩棉花，每亩平均收到七百四十五斤。那年年成很好，我们村里还有人每亩收到六七百斤。一九五一年就不同了，那些每亩收六、七百斤的都降到了三四百斤，我的两亩棉花丰产地，却创造了每亩平均收棉花九百一十二斤的全国新纪录。为什么会有这样的变化呢？一句话，是沾了工人老大哥的光。一九五一年我们互助组买了两张新式步犁，又买了两部解放式水车。新式步犁过去没有见过，村里人都不乐意用，但是我相信共产党和人民政府的号召，我知道工人老大哥专为我们造的家具坏不了。我就第一个用开了。犁起来果然又深、又平、又快，地是虚的，不怕棉花受旱。解放式水车，只有二百多斤，比旧式水车要轻三分之二，抬来抬去非常方便。我们互助组用它在二十亩水地上来回浇，实在得劲，啥时候也旱不了。这两件宝，成了丰产的保证，帮助我创造了全国棉花丰产新纪录，使我得到中央人民政府农业部的奖励。组员们认识了新式农具的好处，对于政府奖给我们的两张新式步犁，都非常喜爱，并且又添买了一架水车。在我们互助组影响下，全村买了五十多张新式步犁、七十辆水车，大家的生产也都提高了。今年，遇到了旱、涝、虫、冻四大灾害，特别是七月里，一连发生了棉铃虫、玉米食穗虫、盲椿象、造桥虫等十三种虫害，来得又多又猛，把棉桃一个一个吃掉了，人们又心痛又着急。幸亏我们有工人老大哥制造的喷雾器和药剂。我们动员了三十二个人下地，四天之内，在二十二亩棉花地里普遍治了两次到四次，喷洒了“一六○五”和“滴滴涕”拌成的药水一万一千多斤。虽然我们动手晚了，每棵棉花平均已经损失了五个半桃子，但到底扑灭了虫害，仍然争取到了丰产。我的九亩丰产地，平均每亩收棉八百一十六斤。记不清是一九四四年还是一九四五年，辛苦了整整一年，眼看棉花要丰收了，突然遇上了灾害，结果连三、五十斤也没收下。一九五二年灾害比那一年都严重，如果没有工人老大哥的支援，怎么能丰产呢？现在，我们互助组已经发展成农业生产合作社，新式农具也多了：有水车、步犁、喷雾器，还有新式耧、铡草机和玉米脱粒机，此外还有专为妇女解决困难用的缝纫机。但是，这还差得远哩。我们一定要加紧生产、加紧建设，使国家工业化早日实现。到那时候，犁地用机器，收割用机器，连摘棉花也用机器，才能真正做到年年丰产，一年比一年更丰产。
    年前山西省开全省农业丰产劳动模范代表会议的时候，我和翼城吴春安、绛县姚文章、盂县刘海悦四人联名向全省棉花丰产模范和全体棉农兄弟提出挑战，保证一九五三年的水地棉花高额丰产地要比
    一九五二年扩大三倍，每亩平均要产棉一千斤到一千一百五十斤；旱地要扩大一倍以上，每亩平均要产棉五百五十斤到一千斤；并保证带动所在村棉花增产百分之三十到三十五，附近三十四个行政村棉花增产百分之二十到三十。多生产一斤棉花，就是多给国家增加一分建设力量，国家工业化和集体化、机械化的时间就会来得更早一些。一九五三年是我们祖国实行五年建设计划的第一年。我们全体农民，都要为实现工业化的总目标而努力。  （吴象代笔）
