    All Employees of the Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant
    Report New Production Achievements to Chairman Mao Zedong
    General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Sends Letter of Commendation

    [This newspaper reports] The Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant successfully test-rolled 0.3 mm thin plates at the end of last December. All employees wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong to report this new achievement and sent representatives to deliver two samples of the thin plates. The General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a letter on January 7 to encourage all employees of the Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant.

    The letter from all employees of the Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant to Chairman Mao:
    Dear Chairman Mao:
    On the eve of the motherland's entry into large-scale economic construction and at the time of the New Year, we would like to report to you the news of the production victory of our Thin Plate Department. Our department is a new workshop that was only built in August 1952. Originally, there were no thin plate technicians, and we had never seen such a new and modern production process. However, under the correct leadership of the Party, with the direct help of Soviet experts and the leadership of veteran technicians from the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company, after two months of operation, more than 100 technicians have been trained. At the same time, new records have been created in terms of output and quality. In October, when test-rolling thin plates, the output per shift was four tons, which increased to 13 tons and 440 kilograms in December, an increase of 92 percent compared to November; the finished product rate also increased from 75 percent to 85 percent. In order to welcome the New Year, we created a new record on December 28; we are now able to roll 0.3 mm thick thin plates and are testing the rolling of 0.3 mm thick silicon steel sheets. This new achievement has created conditions for the motherland's large-scale economic construction. However, we will never be proud or complacent. We will further unite, learn modestly, summarize experience, continue to move forward, and strive to meet the great economic construction tasks of 1953!
    We wish you good health and pay our highest New Year's greetings!

                All Employees of the Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant
                December 31, 1952

    The reply letter from the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the comrades of all employees of the Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant:
    Congratulations on your successful rolling of 0.3 mm thin plates with creative labor under the help of Soviet experts. It is hoped that you will seize the trial production of silicon steel sheets in the future, continue to improve the quality and finished product rate of thin plates, and improve the surface quality of silicon steel sheets to support the great economic construction of 1953. We wish you continuous new victories in production.
    With best regards!

            General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                    January 7, 1953

    太原钢铁厂薄板部全体职工
    向毛泽东主席报告生产新成就
    中国共产党中央委员会办公厅复信嘉勉
    【本报讯】　太原钢铁厂薄板部在去年十二月底试轧零点三公厘的薄板成功，全体职工写信向毛泽东主席报告这一新的成就，并派代表送上薄板样品两件。中国共产党中央委员会办公厅在一月七日复信勉励太原钢铁厂薄板部全体职工。
    太原钢铁厂薄板部全体职工给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席：
    在祖国开始进入大规模经济建设的前夕和时值新年之际，我们特向您报告我们薄板部生产胜利的消息。我部是于一九五二年八月才建设起来的一个新车间，原来没有一个薄板技术工人，对这样新的近代化的生产过程也从来没有见过，但在党的正确领导下，在苏联专家的直接帮助与国营鞍山钢铁公司老技术工人的带领下，经过两个月的操作，现在已培养出一百多名技术工人，同时在产量和质量上创造了新纪录。十月份试轧薄板，每班产量为四吨，到十二月份则提高为十三吨又四百四十公斤，比十一月份提高了百分之九十二；成品率也由百分之七十五提高到百分之八十五。为了迎接新年，我们于十二月二十八日又创造了新纪录；我们已能轧零点三公厘厚的薄板，并正在试轧零点三公厘厚的矽钢板。这一新的成就，给祖国大规模经济建设创造了条件。但我们绝不骄傲自满，我们要进一步团结一致，虚心学习，总结经验，继续前进，为迎接一九五三年伟大的经济建设任务而奋斗！  谨祝您身体健康并致崇高的新年敬礼！
                太原钢铁厂薄板部全体职工
                一九五二年十二月三十一日
    中国共产党中央委员会办公厅的复信太原钢铁厂薄板部全体职工同志：
    庆贺你们在苏联专家的帮助下，以创造性的劳动轧制零点三公厘的薄板成功。希今后抓紧矽钢片的试制工作，继续提高薄板的质量与成品率，改善矽钢片的表面质量，来支援一九五三年伟大的经济建设。祝你们生产上不断获得新的胜利。
    此致敬礼！
            中国共产党中央委员会办公厅
                    一九五三年一月七日
