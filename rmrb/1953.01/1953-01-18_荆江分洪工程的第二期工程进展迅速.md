Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th. The second phase of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is progressing rapidly. Since construction began in mid-November last year, as of January 5th this year, 65 percent of all earthwork and stonework has been completed. Currently, the 180,000 laborers participating in this phase of the project are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters and launching a patriotic labor competition movement on the more than 100-kilometer-long construction site to "welcome large-scale economic construction in 1953." At the current rate, the projects in the second phase, including reinforcing and rebuilding the large and small surrounding dikes, demolishing the shoals upstream and downstream of the intake and control gates, and preliminary dredging of channels, can be completed half a month ahead of schedule.

During the construction of the second phase of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the enthusiasm of the laborers was high due to the attention paid to ideological education. Under the requirements of "good, fast, and economical," a labor competition was launched on the construction site between individuals, groups, and teams. The laborers overcame many difficulties in the construction process, ensuring that the project could continue in the harsh winter climate and improving work efficiency. The Min Gong Brigade of Zhangjin District, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, participating in the drainage channel dredging project within the flood diversion area, under the leadership of Brigade Leader Liu Zhengang, found methods and came up with a series of excellent work methods, overcoming the difficulties of digging silt in the water, turning difficult work into easy work. This Min Gong Brigade, consisting of more than 6,300 people, initially completed one cubic meter of earthwork per person per day, which gradually increased to two cubic meters, with the highest individual record reaching 9.7 cubic meters. The entire team completed all assigned tasks twelve days ahead of schedule, and the project quality also met the standards. Currently, throughout the construction site, the construction efficiency of earthwork projects has generally increased by more than 50 percent.

In the second phase of the project, responsible cadres of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters have been stationed at the construction site for extended periods, going deep among the masses to strengthen specific leadership: on the one hand, inspecting the project quality of each construction site according to the principle of "good, fast, and economical"; on the other hand, urging each construction site to speed up construction in order to complete the project as scheduled and avoid affecting spring plowing production. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hubei Provincial People's Government, and the Hubei Military Region Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army jointly formed a delegation to visit the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project construction site, bringing a large number of medicines, cotton clothing, and two theatrical troupes, to comfort the laborers and technical personnel, further boosting their enthusiasm for work.

    荆江分洪工程的第二期工程进展迅速
    【新华社武汉十六日电】　长江中游荆江分洪工程的第二期工程进展迅速。自去年十一月中旬开工，至今年一月五日止，全部土方、石方工程已完成百分之六十五。目前，参加这期工程的十八万劳动人民热烈响应荆江分洪工程总指挥部的号召，在长达一百多公里的工地上，展开了“迎接一九五三年大规模经济建设”的爱国劳动竞赛运动。按目前的进度，第二期工程中的培修和翻筑大小围堤、刨毁进洪闸、节制闸的上游和下游的滩地和初步疏通渠道等工程，可以提前半个月完成。
    荆江分洪工程的第二期工程施工中，由于注意了对民工的思想教育工作，民工劳动热情高涨。在“好、快、省”的要求下，工地上展开了人与人、组与组、队与队之间的劳动竞赛。民工们克服了施工中的许多困难，保证工程能在严冬气候下继续进行，同时提高了工作效率。参加分洪区内疏浚排水渠工程的湖北省江陵县张金区民工大队，在大队长刘振岗的领导下，找窍门，想办法，创造了一系列优良工作法，克服了水里挖淤泥的困难，使难工变为易工。这个民工大队共六千三百多人，每人每天开始时做一公方土，以后逐渐提高到两公方土，个人纪录最高达到九点七公方土；全队提前十二天完成了所分配的全部任务，工程质量也合乎标准。现在，整个工地上，土方工程的施工效率已普遍提高百分之五十以上。
    第二期工程中，荆江分洪工程总指挥部的负责干部长驻工地、深入群众，加强具体领导：一面依据“好、快、省”的原则，检查各个工地的工程质量；一面督促各工地加紧施工，以求工程能如期完成，避免影响春耕生产。中国共产党湖北省委员会、湖北省人民政府和人民解放军湖北军区司令部联合组成慰问团，带了大批的医药、棉衣，并有两个剧团随行，到荆江分洪工程工地慰问民工和技术人员，更加鼓舞了他们的劳动热情。
