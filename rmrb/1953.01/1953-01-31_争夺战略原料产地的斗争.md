    The struggle for sales markets and investment scope in the capitalist world is becoming increasingly acute. The fierce conflicts between imperialist blocs in capitalist countries for oil, rubber, non-ferrous and rare metals, and other types of strategic raw materials are manifestations of this struggle.

    As everyone knows, American monopoly organizations control the resources of Latin American countries in an almost monopolistic manner. American oil monopolies have consolidated their position in Near Eastern countries, greatly squeezing out their British competitors. American imperialists have intervened in the Belgian Congo and are getting involved in French African territories, while also strengthening their penetration into the raw material resources of Southeast Asia.

    However, these do not satisfy American monopoly capitalists. They are determined to completely occupy all strategic raw material production areas in the capitalist world. To achieve this, they resort to any means. American monopoly capitalists demand that countries receiving American "aid" grant them the right to establish land, sea, and air military bases on their territories. They demand that these countries not only completely open up their own raw material production areas to the United States, but also those in their colonial territories.

    For the same purpose, American capitalist monopolies use agreements on "technical assistance" imposed on backward countries. Under the guise of providing so-called technical and economic assistance, American imperialists brutally interfere in the internal affairs of countries receiving American loans. For example, according to the terms of a loan to India, India can only build new power stations in areas producing manganese, copper, bauxite, and mica, which are of interest to American monopoly capitalists. According to the so-called "technical assistance plan," materials obtained by India from the United States are not under the control of Indian government agencies as Washington demands, but are controlled by American "experts." The number of these "experts" in India is constantly increasing, and they have the right to supervise the activities of Indian agencies, determine the amount of investment in various industrial sectors in India, and so on.

    In January 1951, half a year after the American invasion of Korea, Truman established the so-called "International Materials Policy Commission," which was composed of representatives of monopoly organizations, government agencies, and scientific institutions. In 1952, the commission submitted a lengthy report to Truman, which is further proof that the aggressive intentions of billionaires determine the policies of the American ruling group.

    This report concretely reflects the purpose of the 25-year expansion plan of American monopoly organizations: to seize world raw material production areas and hoard strategic raw materials in order to realize the aggressive plans of American imperialism. The report arbitrarily states that under modern conditions, it seems that there is no longer "a simple national raw material policy that should be implemented by individual countries, but only an international raw material policy..." The report further declares that the United States should assume the "responsibility for mobilizing raw material resources."

    The list of raw material production areas coveted by Wall Street proves the scope of the aggressive ambitions of American billionaires. The authors of the report demanded an increase in the copper and cobalt obtained by the United States from the Congo and Northern Rhodesia, the asbestos and chromium obtained from the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, and the technical diamonds obtained from the Congo, British West Africa, and French Equatorial Africa. The United States regards African colonies as a source of supply for minerals such as iron, tin, lead, zinc, manganese, and cadmium. The agents of American monopoly capitalists, the writers of the report, also did not forget the oil resources of the Near East and the minerals of tin, rubber, mica, and tungsten ore in Southeast Asia.

    In order to facilitate the expansion of monopoly organizations abroad, the American ruling group is doing its best to encourage private capital to invest in countries rich in raw materials and to increase the import of raw materials into the United States at the lowest prices.

    As everyone knows, the United States has greatly increased its capital exports in the post-war period. By the end of 1951, American private and national investments abroad reached 36 billion US dollars, exceeding the investments of all other capitalist countries. At least 20 billion US dollars of this amount belonged to American private investments, and 70-80 percent of this amount was invested in colonies and dependent countries.

    According to the obviously reduced statistical materials published by the United States, American private investment in the foreign mining sector has now reached 6 billion US dollars, of which 4 billion US dollars are invested in oil exploration and processing, and 1.3 billion US dollars are invested in mining and metallurgy. According to statistics from the US Department of Commerce, in recent years, US direct investment in Latin American countries alone has increased by more than two-thirds. Investment in the oil and mining industries in Canada, Venezuela, and Brazil has more than doubled. There has also been a significant increase in American direct investment in Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the Near East and Middle East, and other countries and regions.

    Exporting capital to backward countries brings mythical profits to American monopoly organizations. Even according to the official statistical materials forged by American statistical agencies, the profits earned by American companies on foreign investments are: 17.4 percent in Latin America, 20 percent in the colonies of Western European countries, 31.3 percent in the Near East and Middle East countries, while investments in the United States itself only have a profit of 13.8 percent. The American magazine "Modern Business Overview" reported that the income from foreign investments of American companies and their branches has doubled in five years (from 1946 to 1951).

    Because the pursuit of maximum profits is the driving force of monopoly capitalism and the essence of the basic economic law of modern capitalism, it determines the direction and scope of American investment abroad, and is by no means the hypocritical "concern" for developing the economies of backward countries, as asserted by the Wall Street press servants.

    When describing the notorious "Truman's Point Four Program" on "aid" to backward areas, US Secretary of State Acheson openly admitted: "It is not charity that is driving us. We have our own practical interests in this plan."

    Representatives of "big business" stated the true purpose of the United States even more bluntly. At the meeting of representatives of American monopoly capital giants held in New York last November under the name of "National Foreign Trade Issues Congress," Jack Camp, the deputy manager of "International Harvester Company," openly declared in his speech: "The main purpose of all private investment is profit. Our government can put forward excuses for obtaining this kind of profit, such as 'aiding backward countries,' 'aiding friendly countries,' 'eliminating communism,' and so on. However, whether you and I put dollars into a certain business... then we will get income in the form of profits and dividends."

    The inspirers of American aggressive policy know that the anger and hatred of the people everywhere, including those in colonies and dependent countries that have become raw material appendages of the "American World Empire," against imperialist enslavement is rising day by day. Therefore, they use all kinds of methods to disguise their aggressive plans. They demand to use American-controlled "international organizations," such as the United Nations "Technical Cooperation Office" or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development under Washington's jurisdiction, to cover up the invasion of backward countries by American monopoly capital.

    When implementing the policy of hoarding raw materials, American monopoly capitalists are primarily concerned with hoarding strategic raw materials necessary for the realization of their military aggression plans. But they are also pursuing certain economic goals, which are inseparable from the fierce disputes between British and American monopoly organizations for raw material production areas and investment scope.

    The United States, which possesses a large number of various raw materials, has the possibility of not ordering these raw materials for a long period of time and can manipulate its prices in the capitalist market (the United States has adopted this strategy for the price of tin). In another case, American monopoly capitalists sell a large batch of their hoarded raw materials to the market, causing great losses to the countries producing the raw materials.

    The more raw materials that American imperialism seizes in the colonies of Britain, France, and other Western European countries, the more the high profits of the capitalists of these countries are threatened with collapse. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in his classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," capitalist Britain, followed by capitalist France, will ultimately have to break away from the embrace of the United States and conflict with the United States in order to ensure its own independent status and, of course, its own high profits.

    British monopoly capitalists are currently engaged in a desperate struggle to maintain their position. Regardless of the pressure exerted by the United States, Britain still did not agree to the establishment of a rubber committee and a tin committee within the scope of the so-called international raw material issue conference, because the production of these commodities is now mostly under the control of British capitalists and brings them high profits. The wool committee established by this organization failed to start work due to the resistance of the British and was recently announced to be abolished. American monopoly capitalists attempted to use the activities of the international raw material issue conference to seize the supervision rights of the production and distribution of important strategic raw materials, which fell into a stalemate due to the irreconcilable contradictions among the participants of the conference, especially between the United States and Britain.

    The Imperial Economic Conference held in London at the end of last year once again showed that British monopoly capitalists are strengthening their struggle to preserve their basic sales markets and raw material production areas. As everyone knows, the Imperial Economic Conference formulated a plan to protect the basic strategic and economic position of the British Empire to prevent the attacks of overseas "friends" who want to divide the British Empire.

    Therefore, the facts prove that the policy of American billionaires to seize the raw material production areas of other capitalist countries, primarily Britain and France, leads to a further intensification of the struggle among the accomplices of the imperialist aggression camp.

    争夺战略原料产地的斗争
    苏联  斯潘达里扬  包里沙可夫
    资本主义世界争夺销售市场与投资范围的斗争日益尖锐起来了。资本主义国家中帝国主义集团间争夺石油、橡胶、有色及稀有金属和其他种类的战略原料的剧烈冲突，是这个斗争的表现之一。
    大家都知道，美国垄断组织差不多是以独占方式控制着拉丁美洲各国的资源。美国石油垄断组织在近东各国巩固了自己的地位，使那里的英国竞争者大受排挤。美帝国主义者插手于比属刚果并染指于法属非洲领地，同时也正加强侵入东南亚的原料资源。
    但是，这些都不能使美国垄断资本家满足。他们蓄意要将资本主义世界所有的战略原料产地完全据为己有。为了达到这点，他们便不择手段。美国垄断资本家要求接受美“援”的各国给他们以在其领土上建立陆、海、空军事基地的权利。他们要求这些国家不但将自己领土上的，而且将其殖民地领土上的原料产地对美国完全开放。
    为了同样的目的，美国资本主义的垄断组织便利用强加于落后国家的关于“技术援助”的协定。美帝国主义者在给予所谓技术与经济援助的形式之下，粗暴地干涉着接受美国贷款国家的内政。例如，按照给印度贷款的条件，印度只能在美国垄断资本家发生兴趣的，出产锰、铜、铁矾土、云母的地区建设新的动力站。根据所谓“技术援助计划”，印度由美国所得到的物资，按华盛顿的要求，是不交由印度政府机关支配，而是归美国“专家”支配。在印度这些“专家”的数目不断地增加着，他们有权监督印度机关的活动，决定向印度各工业部门投资的数额等等。
    一九五一年一月间，即美国进攻朝鲜半年之后，杜鲁门成立了所谓“国际原料政策委员会”，该会系由垄断组织、政府机关与科学机关的代表合组而成。一九五二年该委员会向杜鲁门提出了一份长篇报告，这个报告是亿万富翁的侵略意图决定美国统治集团政策的又一明证。
    这个报告具体反映了以二十五年为期的美国垄断组织扩张计划的目的是在夺取世界原料产地和囤积战略原料，以便实现美帝国主义的侵略计划。该报告武断地说，在现代条件下好像已经没有“个别国家所应实行的单纯的一国原料政策，而仅有国际原料政策了……”在报告中更宣布，美国应当负起“动员原料资源事业的责任”。
    华尔街所觊觎的原料产地的清单，证明了美国亿万富翁侵略野心的范围。报告的作者要求增加美国由刚果及北罗得西亚取得的铜及钴，由南非联邦及南罗得西亚取得的石绵及铬，由刚果、英属西非及法属赤道非洲取得的技术钻石。美国把非洲殖民地看作是给它供应铁、锡、铅、锌、锰、镉等矿产的来源地，美国垄断资本家的代理人，报告的编写者，同时也丝毫没有忘记近东的石油富源、东南亚的锡、橡胶、云母、钨砂等矿产。
    美国统治集团为了便利垄断组织在国外的扩张起见，竭力鼓励私人资本向原料丰富的国家投资并增加向美国输入最低价格的原料。
    大家知道，美国在战后时期大大地增加了资本输出。到一九五一年底，美国在国外的私人和国家投资达到了三百六十亿美元，超过了所有其余资本主义国家的投资。这个数目中间至少有二百亿美元是属于美国私人投资的，而这数额的百分之七○—八○是投到殖民地与附属国去的。
    根据美国公布的显然缩小的统计材料，美国在国外采矿业部门中的私人投资，在现时达到了六十亿美元，其中投入石油开采与加工方面的是四十亿美元，投入矿山与冶金方面的为十三亿美元。根据美国商务部的统计材料，最近几年来，美国仅对拉丁美洲国家的直接投资已增加了三分之二以上。对加拿大、委内瑞拉及巴西的石油及采矿工业的投资增加了一倍以上。美国在非洲、澳大利亚、新西兰、近东与中东以及其他国家及地区的直接投资也有显著的增加。
    向落后国家输出资本给美国垄断组织带来了神话般的利润。甚至根据美国统计机关伪造的官方统计材料，美国公司在国外投资所获利润：在拉丁美洲是百分之一七·四，在西欧国家的殖民地是百分之二○，在近东及中东国家是百分之三一·三，而在美国本国的投资却只有百分之一三·八的利润。美国“现代商业一览”杂志报道，美国各公司及其分公司的国外投资的收入，在五年中（由一九四六年至一九五一年）增加了两倍。
    因为追逐最大限度的利润是垄断资本主义的推动力，是现代资本主义的基本经济法则的本质，所以它决定着美国在国外投资的方向和范围，而绝不是华尔街报界奴仆们所断言的什么关于开发落后国家经济的虚伪的“关心”。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊在描绘臭名昭著的关于“援助”落后地区的“杜鲁门第四点计划”时公开地承认：“不是慈善事业在推动着我们。在这个计划中，我们有自己的实际利益”。
    “大企业”的代表们把美国的真正目的说得更为露骨。去年十一月在纽约召开了以“全国对外贸易问题代表大会”为名的美国垄断资本巨头代表的会议，在该会上，“国际收割机公司”的副经理杰克·康普在其演讲中公开宣称：“所有私人投资的主要目的是利润。我们的政府可以提出获得此种利润的借口，如‘援助落后国家’、‘援助友邦’、‘消灭共产主义’等等。但是，无论你和我要是把美元投入某一种事业中去，……那么我们便要得到以利润和股息为形式的收入”。
    美国侵略政策的鼓舞者知道，包括成为“美国世界帝国”原料附属品的殖民地与附属国在内的各处的人民，对帝国主义奴役的愤怒与仇恨正日益高涨。因此，他们用尽各种方法来伪装自己的侵略计划。他们要求用美国管制的“国际组织”，如，联合国的“技术合作处”或华盛顿管辖的国际复兴开发银行的帷幕，来掩盖美国垄断资本对落后国家的入侵。
    美国垄断资本家在执行囤积原料物资政策时，首先关心为实现其军事侵略计划所必需的战略原料的囤积。但他们同时也追求着一定的经济目的，这个目的和英美垄断组织之间为争夺原料产地与投资范围的剧烈争吵是分不开的。
    拥有多种很大数量原料的美国，它有可能在很长的时期内不定购这些原料，并且可在资本主义市场上操纵它的价格（美国对于锡矿的价格已采用了此种策略）。在另一种情况下，美国垄断资本家把自己囤积的一大批原料抛售到市场上，给生产原料的国家造成很大的损失。
    美帝国主义在英、法及其他西欧国家的殖民地攫取的原料愈多，这些国家的资本家的高额利润便愈受到崩溃的威胁。正如斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”这一经典著作中所指示的，资本主义的英国，接着还有资本主义的法国，归根到底将不得不从美国的怀抱里挣脱出来，同美国发生冲突，以便保证自己有独立地位，当然也保证自己有高额的利润。
    英国的垄断资本家目前正在进行拚命的挣扎，以便保持自己的地位。不顾美国所施行的压力，英国还是没有同意在所谓国际原料问题会议的范围内成立橡胶委员会与锡矿委员会，因为这些商品的生产，现在大部分还在英国资本家控制之下，并给他们带来高额利润的缘故。这个组织所成立的羊毛委员会，由于英国人的反抗未能展开工作，并在不久以前宣告撤销。美国垄断资本家企图借国际原料问题会议的活动来夺取重要战略原料的生产与分配的监督权，由于该会议参加者之间，特别是美英间的不可调和的矛盾而陷入了僵局。
    去年年底在伦敦召开的帝国经济会议又一次地表明了英国垄断资本家正在为保存自己的基本销售市场和原料产地而加强斗争。大家知道，在这次帝国经济会议上拟订了保护英帝国基本战略与经济地位的计划，以防止分割英帝国的海外“朋友”的进攻。
    因此，事实证明了美国亿万富翁夺取其他资本主义国家的，首先是英法的原料产地的政策，导使帝国主义侵略阵营同伙间的斗争进一步地尖锐化。
