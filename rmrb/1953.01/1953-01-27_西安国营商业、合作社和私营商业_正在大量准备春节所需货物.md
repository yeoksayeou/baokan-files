    Xi'an State-owned commercial enterprises, cooperatives, and private businesses are accelerating the preparation of large quantities of goods to ensure a sufficient supply for the needs of citizens during the Spring Festival. State-owned grain companies and oil companies are continuously transferring large quantities of rice, flour, and cooking oil. The meat company has purchased 350,000 jin of pork from Gansu, Yan'an and other places. The Monopoly Company has ordered 250,000 jin of Baijiu. The Trade Company has successively transported a large number of non-staple foods, seafood, and dried fruits. Department stores and cotton cloth companies are also fully preparing various items to supply the market. This Spring Festival, state-owned specialized companies will implement the operating policy of wholesale as the main focus, and retail companies will fully supply various major commodities to stabilize retail prices. The Xi'an Cooperative Federation convened a meeting of responsible persons from various grassroots cooperatives on January 17 to discuss the supply of Spring Festival needs for cooperative members and formulate a supply plan for the Spring Festival.
    In order to meet the market needs before the Spring Festival, the People's Bank of Xi'an City began handling short-term revolving loans on January 8, so private businesses are preparing large quantities of festival goods. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    西安市国营商业、合作社和私营商业正在加速准备大量货物，保证充分供应春节期间市民的需要。国营粮食公司、油脂公司正在源源调运大量的米、面和食用油，肉业公司已从甘肃、延安等地购买了三十五万斤猪肉，专卖公司订购的白酒有二十五万斤，贸易公司已陆续运到大批副食品、海味和干果。百货公司、花纱布公司也都正在充分准备各种物品供应市场。今年春节，各国营专业公司都将贯彻以批发为主的经营方针，零售公司将充分供应各项主要商品，以稳定零售价格。西安市合作社联合社在一月十七日召集各基层社负责人开会，讨论供应社员春节需要问题，并订出春节期间的供应计划。
    西安市人民银行为适应春节前市场需要，从一月八日开始办理短期周转贷款，因而私商都大量备办节货。（据新华社讯）
