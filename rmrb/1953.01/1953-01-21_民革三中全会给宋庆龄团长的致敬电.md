To Comrade Song Qingling, Head of the Delegation:

    As you are on your victorious return trip representing the Chinese people from the World People's Peace Congress, we—the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang—are assembled at the Peace Mansion in the capital. Comrades, we extend to you our warmest respect!

    Our meeting has focused on discussing how to meet the three major political tasks of the country. We unanimously recognize that we must emulate the spirit of continuous progress of our great revolutionary pioneer, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and follow his teaching of "taking Russia as a teacher." We must educate all comrades in the Party to love the Soviet Union and learn from its advanced experience, and under the unified leadership of the great Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, strive to build our great motherland.

    You are the inheritor of Mr. Sun's spirit of continuous progress. For many years, you have been fighting tirelessly alongside the people of the whole country for the growth of New China. Your great spirit is a shining example for us comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. We are willing to learn from your spirit and work hard to defend the motherland and defend peace.

    While you are still on your way back, our meeting will conclude today, and we will not be able to hear you personally convey the great achievements of the World People's Peace Congress. However, your solemn speech at the Peace Congress correctly expressed the just voice of the Chinese people and also pointed out to the world the bright future that "the people will surely be able to reverse the situation." We once again express our highest respect to you!

    We sincerely hope that you will guide our work in the future! We wish you eternal health! Long live people's peace!

        The Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
                    January 19, 1953
