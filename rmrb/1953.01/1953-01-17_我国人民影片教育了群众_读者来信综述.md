    Chinese People's Films Educate the Masses
    --A Summary of Reader's Letters
    Recently, we have received more letters from readers reflecting the educational role of Chinese People's films on the masses. Tian Lan from the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' Film Team wrote that after the film "High-Speed Advance" was screened in factories, the innovative spirit of Xiao Meng in the film inspired the workers' production enthusiasm and determination to overcome difficulties. Xiao Fuli, a lathe operator in the Machine Tool Department of the Jinan No. 2 Machine Manufacturing Plant of the East China Industrial Department, had failed several times in creating an automatic tool holder for lathes, and he was very discouraged. The innovative spirit of Xiao Meng in the film "High-Speed Advance" moved him deeply. He plucked up his courage, determined to study hard, and finally succeeded. Gong Fuqing, a worker at the Yantai Private Yongye Clock Factory, after watching "High-Speed Advance," broke through his ideological concerns that "inventions and creations in private factories would lead to wage reductions or even job losses." With the support of the trade union, he finally created a balance wheel mold for alarm clocks, which meant that the balance wheel, which previously required four procedures, could now be made in one go, with no defective products. After the film "Steel Warrior" was screened in factories, the heroic deeds of the soldiers enhanced the workers' patriotic sentiments, and employees in many factories and mines became more actively involved in the increase production and practice economy campaign. Workers at the Tushan Salt Works in Yexian County, Shandong Province, said, "Platoon Leader Zhang and Xiao Liu protected the machines and grain with their lives under such difficult circumstances. We, in a peaceful environment, should be even more willing to work hard and sweat to actively produce." The workers put forward the slogans: "Eliminate third-class salt" and "No matter how heavy the rain, we will never lose a single dou of salt." Yexian County as a whole set a target of increasing production and practicing economy by 10 billion, and the salt factory employees volunteered to complete 8 billion. Many primary school teachers undergoing centralized training in Yexian and Huangxian Counties, Shandong Province, were reluctant to work. After watching the film "Steel Warrior," some teachers said, "This is better than attending two political classes." Many people solved the problem of being unwilling to work. The director of the Culture and Education Section of Huangxian County said, "Movies are really good; they have solved our ideological problems."

    Qu Rongfa from Muping County, Shandong Province, said: After the film "Steel Warrior" was screened in Daxi Village, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, the masses strengthened their work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. They said, "The people's soldiers shed blood and sacrificed for us like this; we should do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers."

    Gong Shuxing and Feng Peng from the former Chahar Provincial Cultural Bureau Film Team wrote: The film team greatly boosted the masses' production enthusiasm by screening films in various places. After the students of Xingzai Village, Yingxian County, former Chahar Province, watched "Pastoral Song of Northern Shaanxi," they wanted to learn from the guerrillas in the film and ensure that each person would catch two jin of pests every day during the pest control and seedling protection work. After the women of the people's school in Xingzhai Village, Shanyin County, watched this film, they gained a deeper understanding of the Marriage Law. Li Yumei, a woman from the village whose marriage was arranged by her parents, was very dissatisfied. After watching the film, she said, "I must get a divorce."

    Li Xishi from Pingnan County, Guangxi, reflected that when the Guangxi Rongxian Special District Film Team went to Daxin Market in Pingnan to screen the film "The White-Haired Girl," the local area was conducting land review work, and farmers from more than a dozen miles around came to watch.

    The film "The White-Haired Girl" left a deep impression on the masses. Many farmers discussed: "The landlords in our neighborhood also abuse women like Huang Shiren, and they also demand rent like Huang Shiren, and many farmers are also forced to death by the landlords like Yang Bailao. Landlords all over the world are equally vicious." Everyone's understanding of the landlord class became clearer, and the screening of the film powerfully promoted the land review work.

    Reader Xuan Ming from the Northeast reflected that the Northeast Film Screening Team went deep into the vast rural areas of the Northeast and was warmly welcomed by the farmers. After the film "Glorious Family" was screened in the countryside, it educated certain military dependents and resolved their mentality of simply relying on government care. Some military dependents expressed that they would do whatever they could themselves in the future and would no longer rely on the government. Once, when the film "The Victory of the Chinese People" was screened in the countryside, Mao Zedong appeared on the screen. An emancipated old farmer woman, seeing Chairman Mao, stood up and ran towards the screen. By the time she got there, the shot of Chairman Mao had already passed. She shouted loudly, "Why did Chairman Mao leave!" After the film screening team explained to her, she expressed her gratitude to Chairman Mao. She had nothing to eat or wear in the past, but now she has a house and land, and she can also watch movies. She said that all this was brought to her by Chairman Mao.

    我国人民影片教育了群众
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们又陆续收到一些读者的来信，反映我国人民影片对群众的教育作用。山东省总工会文教部电影队田岚来信说，影片“高歌猛进”在工厂放映后，影片中小孟的创造精神鼓舞了工人的生产情绪，和克服困难的决心。华东工业部济南第二机器制造厂机工部车工萧福利，过去创造车床自动刀架，几次都失败了，他很灰心。影片“高歌猛进”中小孟的创造精神使他很受感动，他鼓起勇气，下决心钻研，终于成功了。烟台私营永业造钟厂工人龚福庆，看了“高歌猛进”后，打破了“在私营厂有发明创造，会降低工资，甚至打掉饭碗”的思想顾虑，在工会的支持下，他终于创造出背铃闹表摆轮模子，使过去必须经过四遍手续才能制成的摆轮，现在一遍就可以了，而且不出废品。影片“钢铁战士”在工厂放映后，战士们的英雄事迹，提高了工人的爱国主义思想，不少厂矿的职工，更加积极地投入了增产节约运动。山东掖南县土山盐业工人说：“张排长和小刘在那么艰苦的情况下，用生命保护了机器和粮食，咱们在和平的环境中，要更不怕出力和流汗积极生产。”工人们提出了：“消灭三等盐”和“不管天下多大雨，绝不损失一斗盐”的口号。掖南全县提出增产节约一百亿的目标，盐厂的职工自愿完成八十亿。山东掖县和黄县集中学习的小学教员，有许多是不安心工作的，看了影片“钢铁战士”后，有些教员说：“这比上两堂政治课还强。”许多人解决了不安心工作的问题，黄县的文教科长说：“电影真好，给我们解决了思想问题。”
    山东牟平县曲荣法说：“钢铁战士”影片在山东荣成县大西庄放映后，群众对拥军优属的工作加强了，他们说：“人民的战士这样为咱们流血牺牲，我们应该作好拥军优属的工作。”
    原察哈尔省文化局电影队龚书行、冯彭来信说：电影队在各地放映电影，大大鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。原察哈尔省应县杏塞村的学生看了“陕北牧歌”后，要向影片中的游击队员学习，保证在除虫保苗工作当中，每人每天捉二斤害虫。山阴县杏寨村的民校妇女看了这部影片后，对婚姻法有了更进一步的认识。该村妇女李玉梅的婚姻是父母包办的，她很不满意，看了影片后，她说：“我一定要退婚。”
    广西平南县李熙世来信反映，广西容县专区电影队到平南大新墟放映“白毛女”影片时，该地正在进行土地复查工作，附近十几里的农民都跑来看。
    “白毛女”影片在群众中留下了深刻的印象。许多农民谈论着：“我们附近的地主也像黄世仁一样的虐待妇女，也像黄世仁一样的恶要田租，许多农民也像杨白劳一样被地主逼死，天下地主都是一样的恶毒。”大家对地主阶级的认识更清楚了，影片的放映，有力地推动了土地复查工作。
    东北读者萱明反映，东北区电影放映队深入东北地区的广大农村，受到农民的热烈欢迎。影片“光荣人家”在农村放映后，教育了某些军属，给他们解决了单纯依靠政府照顾的思想，有些军属表示：今后自己能干的活一定自己干，不再依靠政府了。有一次“中国人民的胜利”影片在农村放映时，银幕上出现了毛主席，一个翻身农民战老大娘，看见了毛主席，站起来就往银幕那里跑，等她跑到了，毛主席的镜头已映过去了，她大声喊：“毛主席怎么走啦！”当电影放映队向她解释后，她说出了她对毛主席的感激心情。她过去无吃无穿，现在有了房子和地，又可以看到电影，她说这都是毛主席给她带来的。
