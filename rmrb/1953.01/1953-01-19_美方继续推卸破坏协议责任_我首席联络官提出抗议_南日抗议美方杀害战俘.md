Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 17th. Since the U.S. side unilaterally interrupted the Korean armistice talks, U.S. military aircraft have continuously violated the agreement between the two sides, constantly intruding into the airspace over the Panmunjom meeting area. Our delegation liaison officer has repeatedly protested to the other side, demanding that the other side take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of violations of the agreement. However, the other side's chief liaison officer even further attempted to tear up the agreement, claiming that the incidents of military aircraft intruding into the meeting area were "trivial" and did not harm the maintenance of the meeting area.

At the liaison officer meeting on January 16th, the other side's liaison officer once again shamelessly claimed that the U.S. military aircraft flying over the meeting area on January 7th was "harmless," and attempted to shirk the responsibility for violating the agreement with the baseless excuse that climate and technical conditions could not be controlled. Our chief liaison officer immediately sternly pointed out: The agreement and understanding between the liaison officers of the two sides on October 22, 1951, clearly stipulate that military aircraft are prohibited from flying over the meeting area, and the other side is absolutely not allowed to regard the continuous violation of the agreement as "trivial" and "harmless" incidents; when the security officers of the meeting area of both sides jointly investigated the violation of the agreement by the other side on January 7th, the testimonies of both sides fully demonstrated that the weather was clear at that time, and there was no situation where climate conditions and technical conditions could not be controlled. Furthermore, the other side is not allowed to frequently use the excuse that climate conditions and technical conditions cannot be controlled without any concrete factual basis, fundamentally negating the practical significance of the agreement between the two sides.

Our liaison officer finally pointed out that the other side's behavior of violating the meeting area agreement and further attempting to completely tear up the agreement will make it impossible to guarantee the maintenance of the meeting area at all, and will inevitably cause serious consequences. The other side must strictly abide by the agreement and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of violations of the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 17th. On January 12th, the U.S. side killed another of our captured personnel in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp. General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, lodged a serious protest to the other side on January 16th, pointing out that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the war crimes of massacring prisoners of war.

    美方继续推卸破坏协议责任
    我首席联络官提出抗议
    南日抗议美方杀害战俘
    【新华社开城十七日电】自从美方片面中断朝鲜停战谈判以来，美方军用飞机连续违反双方协议，不断侵犯板门店会场区上空，我方代表团联络官曾屡次向对方提出抗议，要求对方采取确实有效措施，使违反协议的事件不再发生。但对方首席联络官竟进一步地企图撕毁协议，声称军用飞机侵犯会场区的事件是“琐屑”的事件，无损于会场区的维持。
    一月十六日双方联络官会上，对方联络官对于一月七日美方军用飞机侵犯会场区的事件又一次无耻地声称军用飞机飞越会场区是“无害的”，毫无事实根据地企图以气候与技术条件无法控制为借口，推卸破坏协议的责任。我方首席联络官当即严正指出：一九五一年十月二十二日双方联络官间的协议与谅解，明确规定禁止军用飞机飞越会场区，决不容许对方将连续破坏协议的事件当作“琐屑”与“无害”的事件；一月七日双方会场区安全军官共同调查对方违反协议的事件时，双方的作证都充分说明当时天气晴朗，根本不存在着气候条件与技术条件无法控制的情况，更不能容许对方毫无具体事实根据地经常以气候与技术条件无法控制为借口，根本取消双方协议的实际意义。
    我方联络官最后指出：对方破坏会场区协议，并进而企图彻底撕毁协议的行为将使会场区的维持根本无法保证，并将必然引起严重后果。对方必须严格遵守协议，采取确实有效的措施，使违反协议的事件不再发生。
    【新华社开城十七日电】一月十二日美方在济州岛战俘营中又害死我方被俘人员一名，朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在一月十六日向对方提出严重抗议，指出美方对屠杀战俘的战争罪行必须负完全责任。
