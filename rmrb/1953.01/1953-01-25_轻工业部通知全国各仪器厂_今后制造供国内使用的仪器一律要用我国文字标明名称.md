    Ministry of Light Industry Notifies All Instrument Factories Nationwide:
    Instruments Manufactured for Domestic Use Must Hereafter Have Their Names Marked in Chinese Characters

    Editor: On December 31st of last year, the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published a suggestion from reader Zhong Sheng entitled "Domestically Manufactured Physics and Chemistry Instruments Should Have Their Names Marked in Chinese Characters." This suggestion is correct. On January 8th, our ministry issued a notice to the industry bureaus (departments) and metrological industry offices of all provinces (cities) stipulating that, henceforth, all instruments manufactured by instrument factories nationwide for domestic use must have their names marked in Chinese characters; for instruments that do not yet have a unified name in China, foreign language notations may be added after the Chinese name for reference. Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    轻工业部通知全国各仪器厂
    今后制造供国内使用的仪器一律要用我国文字标明名称
    编辑同志：去年十二月三十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了读者钟声提出的“国内制造的物理、化学仪器应该用我国的文字标明名称”建议。这个建议是正确的。我部已于一月八日给全国各省（市）工业厅（局）、度量衡工业处发出通知，规定今后全国各仪器厂所制供国内使用的仪器，一律用我国文字标明名称；国内尚无统一名称的仪器，可参注外文于我国文字名称之后。  中央人民政府轻工业部
