    Watching the Performances of "The Peaches are Ripe" and "Little White Rabbit"

    The establishment of the Affiliated Chinese Children's Theater Troupe of the China Youth Art Theater and its recent performances in Beijing indicate that our younger generation is beginning to establish and will gradually expand their own rich spiritual life.
    The Chinese Children's Theater Troupe is currently performing two children's plays - "The Peaches are Ripe" and "Little White Rabbit." The former is a script written by Ren Dalin and revised by Lu Yanong, while the latter is adapted from the Soviet fairy tale play "The Smug Little Rabbit" by Sergei Mikhalkov. The actors in these two plays are mostly children. They act very seriously, as if they are not acting, but living. This is because the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the characters in the play have a consistent place with the children's actual lives, thoughts, and feelings, thus naturally having a harmonious resonance.
    "The Peaches are Ripe" depicts the excellent qualities of several rural Young Pioneers and their social activities, which are precisely the qualities and social activities of the young generation of New China that are growing universally. "Little White Rabbit" depicts the brave, resourceful, lively, and innocent character of the little rabbits, as well as their shortcomings, which are precisely the general advantages and easily occurring shortcomings shown in the character of our children. Because of this, not only are the children as actors able to understand the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the characters in the play, but the child audience members can also understand every action and every word of the characters in the play, merging their thoughts and feelings into one, sharing their joys, sorrows, and accepting their experiences and lessons of success and failure, receiving significant education. When
    "The Peaches are Ripe" shows the children rescuing the ripe peaches on the tree for Uncle Sun in the storm, the young audience burst into enthusiastic applause. This applause is not simply an expression of their gratitude for the actors' serious performance, but an approval and encouragement of the actions of these characters in the play. When Uncle Sun finds the peaches in the baskets in the shed, and the children come out from their hiding places, the children in the audience laugh happily. How earnestly the children are savoring the joy and happiness of doing good deeds. When the Little White Rabbit gets the shotgun and proudly says to the rabbits in the house he personally snatched back from the fox: "This feather pillow is mine. This stool and table are mine. This shotgun is also mine," the children in the audience immediately emit dissatisfied jeers; but when the Little White Rabbit is chatting happily with the cunning red fox while holding the shotgun, and the gray wolf secretly approaches from behind, the little audience members immediately forget the Little White Rabbit's shortcomings and can't help but loudly remind the Little White Rabbit, "The wolf is coming! The wolf is coming!" This not only shows that the children can distinguish the Little White Rabbit's kind nature and his shortcomings, but also fully expresses their hatred and anger towards the brutal and greedy (specifically embodied in the fox and wolf). They will never tolerate any good characters being harmed and will not hesitate to express their clear attitude towards all things. When seeing these scenes, who can not be moved by the frankness and sincerity of the children (including actors and audience)?
    The performance of the Chinese Children's Theater Troupe is good. These two plays, especially "Little White Rabbit," are extremely beautiful and moving in terms of music and dance. The dance movements of the rabbits and the fox not only show the characteristics of these animal movements, but also portray their different personalities. The scenery and lighting can also skillfully depict the beautiful fairy tale world, so that when the curtain opens, the young audience is immediately attracted. All of this is quite important for child audiences who are full of fantasy, curiosity, and impatient with tedious and lengthy dialogues.
    If there are shortcomings in this performance, then the main shortcoming lies in the selection and adaptation of the script. "The Peaches are Ripe" is not a very good children's play. It emphasizes the older generation's (through the military dependent Uncle Sun) lack of understanding of the younger generation, reducing the expression of the new qualities of the younger generation to a secondary position, thereby weakening the play's educational power for children. Secondly, it is also unreasonable to inappropriately give the military dependent Uncle Sun a particularly conservative character. A volunteer soldier's father, who has deeply experienced the glory and concern the people give him, and has also often received the enthusiastic help and love from the Young Pioneers, yet he always maintains an unbreakable prejudice and suspicion against them, even treating them as thieves. Strictly speaking, this is uglifying the image of the military dependent.
    There are also some shortcomings in the adaptation of "Little White Rabbit." Usually, in all fairy tales (including fairy tale plays), in addition to "personification" of birds and animals—that is, giving birds and animals human nature—they still conform to certain natural laws. The natural laws in fairy tales are manifested in two aspects. The first is that although animals are personified, they still retain their animal nature. For example, its characteristics in terms of life, personality, hobbies, habits, etc. The second is that it does not violate the natural relationship between animals and animals. For example, it is acceptable to say that a fox eats "braised rabbit meat," but it is not acceptable to say that a rabbit eats "braised fox meat." It is acceptable to say that a hunter wants to hunt rabbits, but it is unnatural to say that rabbits ask a hunter to be their protector, because rabbits will never be friends with hunters. The original play "The Smug Little Rabbit" handles the hunter differently: "To the director" says this: "The author calls the hunter 'the poor hunter,' which clearly shows this character. On the stage, he should be portrayed as definitely not a professional hunter, but an inexperienced hunting enthusiast, a fool who wastes bullets." "The poor hunter" also says when he appears: "I have suffered a lot, I am exhausted, but I have not hunted anything." That is to say, the hunter has not forgotten to hunt the little rabbit, he just hasn't hunted it. This does not obliterate or cover up the inherent contradiction between the hunter and the rabbit. Now, in "Little White Rabbit," the hunter is treated as the rabbit's protector, and in order to make the hunter protect the rabbits, he is even allowed to sleep in the forest for a nap, from noon until the next morning. This shapes the hunter into an incredible character, and it is difficult to understand such a hunter in the children's life experience.
    After watching the performance of the Chinese Children's Theater Troupe, I thought of two issues related to developing children's theater work:
    1. Children's theater has a great educational effect, because children's theater activities can not only help cultivate the "little actors'" abilities in language and activities, but also play a significant role in cultivating the qualities of children (including the audience and actors), and even have an undeniable educational power for adult audiences. There is no doubt that in the future, children's theater activities will gradually and universally expand as all aspects attach importance to children's work; therefore, theater workers and children's literature and art workers should unswervingly support this work, creating more and better scripts for children to meet the needs of performances, and pay special attention to creating more scripts suitable for small-scale performances in general schools. Theater workers and children's literature and art workers must contact children more and understand their lives, thoughts, and feelings in order to do this work well.
    2. China's children's theater work is still in its infancy and experimental stage. This performance by the Chinese Children's Theater Troupe provides good experience for developing children's theater work. It is hoped that the Chinese Children's Theater Troupe will not only perform regularly, but also pay attention to guidance work and promote children's theater activities in schools.

### 看“桃子熟了”和“小白兔”的演出

    看“桃子熟了”和“小白兔”的演出
    贺宜
    中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团的成立以及它最近在北京的演出，说明我们的幼年一代正在开始建立并将逐步扩展他们自己的丰富精神生活的领域。
    中国少年儿童剧团最近正在演出两个儿童剧——“桃子熟了”和“小白兔”。前者是任大霖编、鲁亚农修改的剧本，后者则是根据苏联谢·米海尔柯夫的童话剧“神气活现的小兔子”改编的。这两个戏的演员，绝大多数都是小朋友。他们演得很认真，好像他们不是在演戏，而是在生活。这是因为剧中人物的生活、思想和感情和孩子们实际的生活、思想、感情有其一致的地方，因而很自然地有了和谐的共鸣。
    “桃子熟了”所表现的几个农村少年队员们的优秀品质，和他们的社会活动，正是新中国年幼一代在普遍地成长着的品质和他们的社会活动。“小白兔”所表现的小兔子们的勇敢、机智、活泼、天真的性格以及他们的若干缺点，也正是我们的孩子们在性格上所表现的一般的优点和容易发生的缺点。就因为这样，不仅作为演员的孩子们易于体会剧中人物的生活、思想、感情，儿童观众们也能够理解剧中人物的每一个举动和每一句话，和剧中人物的思想感情融合成一片，分享他们的喜怒哀乐，并接受他们成功和失败的经验和教训，受到显著的教育。当
    “桃子熟了”演到孩子们在暴风中，紧张地为孙大伯抢救满树成熟的桃子时，小观众们爆发了热烈的掌声，这掌声并不是单纯表示他们对演员们认真表演的感谢，而是批准和鼓励这些剧中人的行为。在孙大伯发现桃子都在窝棚的篮子里，而孩子们都从隐蔽处走出来时，台下的孩子们都愉快地笑起来。孩子们是多么认真地在咀嚼着做了好事情以后的喜悦和幸福。当小白兔获得了猎枪以后，在亲自从狐狸那里夺回的屋子里骄傲地对兔子们说：“这羽毛枕头是我的。这凳子和桌子是我的。这猎枪也是我的”的时候，台下的孩子们立刻发出不满的讥笑；可是当小白兔拿着猎枪，满意地和刁滑的红毛狐狸聊天，而灰毛狼从背后偷偷近前的时候，台下的小观众们又立刻忘记了小白兔的缺点，情不自禁地大声提醒小白兔说：“狼来了！狼来了！”这不仅是孩子们能分清小白兔善良的本质和他的缺点，而且也充分地表示了他们对残暴贪婪（具体的形象是狐狸和狼）的憎恨和愤怒。他们决不容忍任何善良的人物受到损害，毫不犹豫地表示他们对一切事物的鲜明态度。当看到这些地方，谁能不为孩子们（包括演员和观众）的坦率、真诚所感动呢？
    中国少年儿童剧团的演出成绩是好的。这两个戏，特别是“小白兔”，在音乐舞蹈方面是极优美的，动人的。兔子们和狐狸的舞蹈动作，不但表现了这些动物动作的特点，而且还刻划出他们的不同性格。在布景和灯光方面也能很巧妙地把美丽的童话世界描绘出来，因而当幕一揭开的时候，小观众们就立即被吸引住了。所有这些，对于富于幻想的、好奇的、不耐枯燥冗长的对白的儿童观众们说来，是相当重要的。
    如果说这个演出有缺点的话，那么，主要的缺点是在剧本的选择和改编上。“桃子熟了”并不是一个很好的儿童剧本。它强调年老一代（通过军属孙大伯）对幼年一代的不了解，把表现幼年一代的新品质降低到次要地位，从而削弱了这个剧本对儿童的教育力量。其次，把军属孙大伯不适当地赋予特别保守的性格，也是不合情理的。一个志愿军的父亲，他曾经深切体会到人民给他的光荣和关切，也曾经经常接受少年队员们对他热情的帮助和爱戴，而他却始终对他们保持牢不可破的成见和怀疑，甚至把他们当作小偷。严格地说，这是把军属的形象丑化了。
    在“小白兔”一剧的改编上面也存在一些缺点。通常在所有的童话（包括童话剧）中间，鸟兽在“人格化”——就是说赋予鸟兽以人性——以外，仍然符合一定的自然规律。童话中的自然规律，表现为两方面，第一是动物虽然人格化，但仍保留它自己的动物性。例如它在生活、性格、嗜好、习惯等等方面的特点。第二是不违反动物与动物之间的自然关系。例如说狐狸吃“红炖兔子肉”则可，说兔子吃“红炖狐狸肉”则不可。说猎人要打兔子则可，说兔子请猎人做保护人，就不自然了，因为兔子决不会和猎人做朋友的。原剧“神气活现的小兔子”里对猎人的处理是不同的：“给导演者的话”中这样说：“作者把猎人叫做‘苦猎人’，这一来就把这人物明白地表明出来了。在舞台上，应该把他演成决不是一个职业的猎人，而是一个没有经验的打猎迷，一个白白浪费子弹的笨家伙”。 “苦猎人”出场的时候也说：“我吃尽了苦，我累得要命，可是什么东西也没打到。”就是说，猎人没有忘记要打小兔子，只是没有打到而已。这样就没有抹煞或掩盖猎人和兔子中间应有的矛盾。现在，在“小白兔”中间，猎人被处理成为兔子的保护人，并且为了要使猎人保护兔子们，竟让他在森林里睡的午觉，从中午一直睡到次日早晨。这样就把猎人塑造成为一个不可思议的人物，在孩子们的生活经验里也很难理解这样的猎人。
    在看了中国少年儿童剧团的演出以后，我想起了两个有关开展儿童戏剧工作的问题：
    一、儿童戏剧有很大的教育作用，因为儿童戏剧活动不仅能帮助培养“小演员”在语言和活动方面的能力，而且在培养儿童（包括观众和演员）的品质方面也有重大的作用，甚至对于成人观众也有不可忽视的教育力量。没有疑问，今后儿童戏剧活动，必将随着各方面对儿童工作的重视而逐渐普遍展开；因此，戏剧工作者和儿童文艺工作者应该义不容辞地支持这个工作，为儿童们创作更多更好的剧本，以应演出的需要，特别要注意多创作一些适于一般学校小规模演出的剧本。戏剧工作者和儿童文艺工作者为了要做好这一工作，必须多接触儿童，了解他们的生活思想和感情。
    二、中国的儿童戏剧工作尚在草创和实验阶段。此次中国少年儿童剧团的演出，提供了开展儿童戏剧工作的良好经验。希望中国少年儿童剧团除了经常演出以外，还能注意辅导工作，推动学校中的儿童戏剧活动。
