    Opinions on Winter Training Work in the Construction Department
    Zhang Tan, Manager of the Construction Engineering Company of the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department
    In the basic construction departments, earnestly carrying out winter training for workers, cadres, and technical personnel is the most effective way to solve the current major contradiction in basic construction—the heavy and arduous tasks and the insufficient construction force. Therefore, we must pay great attention to this work. Regarding the winter training work of the Northeast Industrial Department's Construction Engineering Company, I would like to offer a few opinions for reference.
    1. Worker Training
    In 1952, the company had a large number of permanent workers, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of workers used this year. Most of these workers are new, with low political awareness and technical level, unfamiliar with advanced experiences, and do not have a sufficient grasp of the new technical operating procedures, but they have to construct newly designed standard buildings. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to conduct political and technical training for workers. The main goal of political training is to improve workers' class consciousness. Through communist education, they should have a clear understanding of the prospects of national construction and understand the important significance of basic construction. This education should be carried out through lectures, reports, discussions, seminars, visits to Soviet films and pictures, and holding life reminiscence meetings. Technical training should be given on the basis of improved political awareness.
    Technical training should include the following aspects:
    (1) Organize the study of operating procedures and quality standards. Most workers are still unfamiliar with these aspects, and some old skilled workers have deep-rooted habits and stick to conventions; some new workers cannot master them due to their low technical level. Therefore, in order to make workers comply with operating procedures and ensure project quality, it is necessary to vigorously conduct education in winter training so that they are familiar with and understand the principles involved. The leadership should summarize the experience of technical operations over the past few years, first draft a draft, and then conduct education, organize discussions, and turn it into regulations.
    (2) Promote advanced experience. In recent years, there have been many relatively mature advanced experiences, such as masonry, carpentry, rebar, concrete, plastering, plumbing and electrical aspects, all have better experience. These experiences should be reported, performed, operated, and discussed in various types of work in order to be widely promoted. In general, existing ones should be promoted first, and after mastering the existing ones, promote creation, invention, and improvement, but prevent the tendency of disliking to learn from others and creating behind closed doors. The second is to conduct education on segmented parallel flow operation, so that workers know its content, the relationship between various types of work, responsibilities, and division of labor, and so on.
    (3) On the basis of operating procedures, quality standards, and advanced experience education, carry out actual operation training, so that workers not only understand and know, but also become proficient. Experience has proved that unskilled apprentices cannot fill the heart well when building bricks; if they are not proficient in squeezing the mortar with both hands, they will not be able to squeeze the clear water wall. After winter training, third-class technicians should become second-class workers, and second-class workers should become first-class workers.
    (4) According to operating procedures and advanced experience, study the organization, division of labor, group system, how the group formulates plans, and how to ensure quality and complete plans. The group plan should be formulated according to parallel flow operation and production instruction diagrams, which is the grassroots plan for parallel flow operation.
    (5) Conduct technical safety education. Judging from the situation in 1952, workers still lack sufficient understanding of the importance of technical safety work, and they also have very little knowledge of safety technology. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen education in this area so that they know the basic knowledge of technical safety in their own type of work and know that doing a good job in safety work is an important method to ensure safe operation and accelerate progress.
    In addition, the proportion of mechanized construction will increase even more in the future, and there is a great shortage of technicians who master machinery. Therefore, it is also urgently necessary to train mechanics in winter.
    2. Training of Cadres and Technical Personnel
    First of all, cadres must summarize the experience of the past year. The experience in basic construction in 1952 is relatively rich. Good summaries will be of great benefit to winter training and the work in 1953. After summarizing the experience, it is necessary to conduct democratic make-up lessons and ideological criticism. This is to raise the advantages and disadvantages of one year's work to the height of thought and improve ideologically. In terms of ideological criticism, the focus should be on examining issues such as a responsible attitude towards national construction, the mass viewpoint, and the mass line. On this basis, communist education will be carried out. In technical business education, the following objects should be distinguished:
    (1) Construction workers. Construction workers and small and medium-sized captains are grassroots leading cadres. They are not only administrative leaders, but also concrete technical leaders. Technical management, plan management, and promotion of advanced experience on the construction site all need to rely on them to implement it to the workers. Therefore, the quality of the work of construction workers and captains is directly related to the quality of the project. Therefore, the technical business training requires: 1. They should learn what workers do not understand. Construction workers should be familiar with and master the content and basic principles of quality standards, advanced experience, technical safety, parallel flow operation, etc. 2. Improve technical level, such as making them learn simple calculations, read drawings in their own responsibility, and be able to copy, set out and turn over the materials. If you do not know, or can not skillfully master the above basic technology, is not enough construction qualification. However, it is not difficult for people with low education to learn these. As long as the old workers can operate, find more old drawings and explain more, they will understand. Using a slide rule, they can learn it with a single teaching.
    (2) Construction site director. The construction site is the grassroots leadership unit for construction. It not only simply leads the construction, but more importantly, it must also carry out a series of complex and detailed organizational work. Because the construction site is scattered and complex, the solution of problems also needs to be relatively fast and correct. The quality of the construction site director is closely related to the quality of the project. The director of a relatively major construction site should select a part from the party member cadres who are strong in politics and a part from the technical personnel. A larger construction site (around 10,000 square meters) should have three construction site directors: one who is politically strong, one who manages technology and planning, and one who is an old technician. If they can cooperate well, the construction site will be well led.
    Technical business education should be carried out according to the summary of one year's experience. The leadership should prepare, then report and explain, and then discuss. The discussion should be combined with checking the work. The content of business education is:
    1. Plan management: The main focus is on learning how to organize segmented parallel flow operations according to project instruction diagrams, and learning how to formulate and implement project plans. 2. Technical management: The main focus is on learning new design standards, how to implement new technical operating procedures to workers, and establishing a series of technical quality responsibility systems and inspection systems. 3. Promotion of advanced experience: Focus on criticizing the idea of not paying attention to the promotion of advanced experience, and learn how to master and lead the promotion of various advanced experience. 4. Construction organization design: Learn to do a good job of construction organization design before construction in order to implement economic accounting. The above-mentioned content should be implemented with the education of democratic management, combined with the study of workers' welfare facilities, technical safety, and relevant important policies and regulations.
    (3) Other material staff, tool staff, construction machinery management staff, salary staff, technical safety staff, accountants, statisticians, etc., should also be trained separately. After this training, it is required to achieve: The material staff can identify material specifications, performance, and quality, and can store and supply materials according to project instruction diagrams, as well as be familiar with the transportation, receipt, dispatch, and storage of materials. The tool staff can identify the types, uses, and quality of tools, and can store and supply tools according to project instruction diagrams, as well as be familiar with the transportation, receipt, dispatch, and storage of tools. Construction machinery management personnel can identify the types, performance, and simple structure of machinery, schedule machinery according to the machinery and equipment usage instruction diagram, and should also understand machinery maintenance knowledge and simple principles. Some of the salary staff should be able to master and implement the country's salary policy, and some should understand the general knowledge of salaries and be able to perform salary standard setting. Technical safety staff should be familiar with and master all the technical safety measures necessary for the progress of various projects and implement the relevant technical safety regulations. Accountants should be able to master cost management and economic accounting, as well as salary distribution. Statisticians should be good at analyzing and researching statistical data, that is, analyzing the economic activities of enterprises and raising questions.
    In addition, there is now a general shortage of technical cadres. One of the solutions is: select a group from young employees with secondary school degrees and workers with higher education levels, and give them three or four months of training in mathematics, blueprint reading, budgeting, and engineering common sense, etc. After the start of construction in 1953, they will be assigned to help engineers and construction site directors work, and then given training in winter. In this way, after a few years, a group of technical talents can also be cultivated.
    3. Organizational Leadership Issues in Winter Training
    Winter training is a very heavy and meticulous organizational work. How the organizational leadership is conducted and how the time is allocated are closely related to the effectiveness of the winter training work.
    (1) Time allocation. Workers participating in winter training will gradually enter the construction site in February in the spring of 1953. Therefore, the actual training time is only more than three months. If you don't grasp it tightly, it will definitely be too late. Although some projects are still under construction, such as some carpenters, plasterers, plumbers, electricians, etc. are still working, accountants need to calculate accounts, projects need to be settled, etc., they can still be trained for two or three hours every morning and evening. After two or three months, although they enter the construction site, they can also be trained in the morning and evening.
    Generally speaking, it is best to concentrate efforts on summarizing and political study at the beginning, and switch to technical business study and research on the basis of improving political awareness. Before the start of construction, time should also be taken to adjust the organization, arrange the work in 1953, and other preparatory work, such as materials, plans, temporary projects, familiarizing with drawings, and technical business preparation, etc.
    (2) The training objects should focus on workers, construction site directors, and construction workers.
    (3) In terms of leadership methods, the company or department/team should organize a unified winter training committee, and then lead and conduct inspections separately. In terms of management methods, democratic management should be carried out. It is best for teachers to receive short-term training before teaching workers, or teachers with higher quality should give preparation lessons first, and then go to class separately after discussion. Teachers should participate in and lead workers' discussions.

    关于建筑部门冬季训练工作的意见
    东北人民政府工业部建设工程公司经理  张潭
    在基本建设施工部门中，认真地进行对工人、干部和技术人员的冬季训练，是解决目前基本建设中主要矛盾——任务重大艰巨而施工力量不足的最有效的办法。因此，我们必须十分重视这一工作。现就东北工业部建设工程公司冬季训练工作情况，提出几点意见，以供参考。
    一、工人的训练
    该公司一九五二年固定工人的数字很大，占今年使用工人总数百分之五十以上。这些工人大半是新的，政治觉悟和技术水平都不高，对先进经验不熟，对新的技术操作规程也掌握不够，而他们却要在新设计的标准建筑物上施工。因此，对工人进行政治和技术训练，是迫切需要的。在政治训练上，主要是提高工人的阶级觉悟，通过共产主义教育，使之对国家建设的远景有清楚的认识，对基本建设的重要意义有所了解。这种教育，应以讲解、报告、讨论、座谈、参观苏联电影图片、举行生活回忆会等方式进行。在政治觉悟提高的基础上再给予技术训练。
    技术训练上应包括以下几个方面：
    （一）组织学习操作规程、质量标准。大部分工人对于这方面仍是不熟不懂，有的老技术工人积习较深，墨守成规；有的新工人因技术水平低掌握不了。因此，欲使工人遵守操作规程，保证工程质量，在冬季训练中大力进行教育，使他们熟悉并明白其中的道理是很必要的。领导上应总结几年来技术操作方面的经验，先拟定草稿，然后进行教育，组织讨论，变成法规。
    （二）推广先进经验。几年来已经有了许多较成熟的先进经验，如砌砖、木工、铁筋、混凝土、抹灰、水暖电气等方面，都有较好的经验。这些经验，应在各工种中进行报告、表演、操作、讨论，以便普遍推广起来。一般地应首先推广现有的，精通现有的以后，再进而推动创造发明和提高，但要防止不喜欢学别人的、关门创造的偏向。其次就是进行关于分段平行流水作业的教育，使工人知道它的内容，各工种之间的关系、职责和分工等等。
    （三）在操作规程、质量标准和先进经验教育的基础上，进行实际操作的训练，使工人不但要懂、要会，而且要熟练。经验证明：非熟练徒工砌砖就填不好心；双手挤浆不熟练，清水墙就挤不了。经过冬季训练，应使三等技工变成二等工，二等工变成一等工。
    （四）依操作规程和先进经验研究工人的组织、分工、小组制度、小组如何制订计划、如何保证质量、保证完成计划等。小组计划应依平行流水作业、生产指示图来制订，它是平行流水作业的基层计划。
    （五）进行技术保安的教育。从一九五二年的情况来看，工人对技术保安工作的重要性，仍是认识不足的，保安技术的知识也很少。因之要加强这方面的教育，使他们知道本工种技术保安方面的基本知识，知道做好保安工作，是保证安全操作、加速进度的重要方法。
    此外，今后机械化施工的比重更要增高，而掌握机械的技工却很缺乏，因此在冬天训练机械工，也是迫切需要的。
    二、干部和技术人员的训练
    干部首先要总结一年来的经验。一九五二年基本建设中的经验是比较丰富的，总结得好，对冬季训练和一九五三年的工作都会有极大好处。总结经验之后，要进行民主补课、思想批判，这样就是把一年工作的优缺点提到思想高度来认识，在思想上提高一步。在思想批判方面，应着重从国家建设的负责态度、群众观点、群众路线等问题进行检查。在这个基础上再进行共产主义的教育。在技术业务教育上，应分清下列对象：
    （一）施工员。施工员和中小队长是基层领导干部，他们不单是行政领导，而且是具体技术的领导人，工地的技术管理、计划管理以及推广先进经验，都需要依靠他们贯彻到工人中去。因此，施工员和中队长工作质量，直接关系着工程的好坏，因而在技术业务训练上就要求：1、工人不懂的东西，他们应当学会。质量标准、先进经验、技术保安、平行流水作业等，施工员均应熟悉掌握它们的内容和基本原理。2、提高技术水平，如使他们学会简单的计算、会看本人专责中的图纸、会抄平、放线和翻样配料。如果不会或者是不能熟练掌握上述基本技术，就不够施工员资格。不过，文化程度低的学这些也并不难，凡是老工人会操作的，多找些旧图纸，多讲解，即能懂，使用计算尺，一教也能会。
    （二）工地主任。工地是施工的基层领导单位，它不仅单纯领导施工，更重要的还要进行一系列复杂而细致的组织工作。由于施工现场分散、复杂，所以解决问题也需要比较迅速和正确，工地主任的好坏就密切关系着工程的好坏。较为重大工地的主任，应从政治上强的党员干部中选择一部分，从技术人员中选择一部分，较大的工地（在一万平方公尺上下），就应有三个工地主任：政治上较强的一个，管技术计划的一个，老技术工人出身的一个，能配合好，工地就会领导好。
    技术业务教育，应当根据总结一年的经验来进行，领导上准备好，再报告、讲解，而后讨论，讨论中要联系检查工作。业务教育的内容是：
    1、计划管理：主要是学习按工程指示图组织分段平行流水作业的方法，学会如何制订与贯彻工程计划。2、技术管理：主要是学习新设计标准，如何将新技术操作规程贯彻到工人中去，以及建立一系列的技术质量责任制、检查制等。3、推广先进经验：着重批判不重视推广先进经验的思想，以及学会如何掌握领导推广各项先进经验。4、施工组织设计：学会在施工前做好施工组织设计，以贯彻经济核算制。上述各项内容中，应贯彻民主化管理的教育，结合工人的福利设施、技术保安及有关重要政策法令的学习。
    （三）其他材料员、工具员、施工机械管理员、工资员、技术保安员、会计员、统计员等，亦应分别进行训练，经过这次训练，要求达到：材料员能识别材料规格、性能、质量，并能按照工程指示图储备和供应材料，以及熟悉材料的运输、收发和保管等工作。工具员能识别工具的种类、用途、质量，能按照工程指示图储备和供应工具，以及熟悉工具的运输、收发、保管等工作。施工机械管理员能识别机械类型、性能和简单构造，按机械设备使用指示图进行机械的调度，并应懂得机械的保养知识和简单的原理。工资员应有一部分能掌握与贯彻国家的工资政策，也应有一部分能懂得工资的一般常识，能进行工资标定。技术保安员能熟悉掌握在各项工程进行中所必需的一切技术保安措施，执行有关技术保安的各项规定。会计员应能掌握成本管理与经济核算，以及工资发放等工作。统计员则应善于分析研究统计资料，也就是作企业经济活动的分析，提出问题。
    此外，现在技术干部普遍不足，解决的办法之一是：从中学程度的年轻职员中、文化程度较高的工人中选择一批，给以三四个月的数学、看图、预算及工程常识等业务的训练，一九五三年开工后分配他们帮助工程师、工地主任工作，冬天再给以训练，这样经过几年，也可以培养出一批技术人才来。
    三、冬季训练中的组织领导问题
    冬季训练是一件十分繁重而细致的组织工作，组织领导得如何，时间分配得如何，和冬季训练工作的效果有密切关系。
    （一）时间分配，参加冬季训练的工人在一九五三年春二月，即要陆续进入施工现场，因此实际训练时间，只有三个多月。如抓的不紧，绝对来不及。目前虽有些工程仍在施工，如有些木工、抹灰、水暖、电气等工人还在工作，会计要算账，工程要结算等等，但每天早晚仍可对他们进行二三小时的训练工作，二三月后虽进入工地，但早晚亦可进行训练。
    一般说来，一开始最好集中力量进行总结及政治学习，在提高政治觉悟的基础上转入技术业务的学习研究。在开工之前还要拿出时间调整组织，布置一九五三年工作及其他准备工作，如材料、计划、暂设工程、熟悉图纸及技术业务上的准备工作等等。
    （二）训练对象应以工人、工地主任、施工员为主。
    （三）在领导方法上，应由公司或处、队组织统一的冬季训练委员会，而后分别领导与进行检查。在管理方法上，则应进行民主化管理。教员最好先受短时期的训练，再给工人上课，或先由质量较高的教员上准备课，经过讨论后再分头上课去，教员最好参加并领导工人讨论。
