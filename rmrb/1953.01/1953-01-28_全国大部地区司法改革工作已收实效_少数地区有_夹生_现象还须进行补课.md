Most areas nationwide have basically concluded the organizational consolidation and ideological remolding phase of the judicial reform movement and have entered a new construction phase. Only a few areas have seen slower progress in the movement; for example, in the Central-South region, half of the areas will not complete this phase until January or February. There are also a few areas with "half-baked" phenomena that require further in-depth work.

The judicial reform movement across the country is generally normal and healthy, and has basically achieved the goals of consolidating organizations and transforming ideologies. In most areas, the movement punished a small number of bad elements who had seriously harmed the people in the past, reassigned some old judicial personnel who had made mistakes or were incompetent, and at the same time, transferred a large number of outstanding cadres, workers, peasants, youth, and women to work in the People's Courts. In the East China region alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,100 people were newly added to the judicial organs. In the Southwest region, in order to strengthen the leadership of the People's Courts, more than 75% of the counties in the region have been equipped with full-time presidents of the People's Courts. Most of these people's judicial cadres, who were directly promoted from the masses or transferred from other work posts, have clear positions and views, are enthusiastic about their work, and are good at contacting the masses. Through learning and mobilizing the masses to participate in handling cases, they have quickly become familiar with the work. Many original judicial cadres in various places have greatly strengthened their work confidence because they have clarified the boundaries between the old and new laws, clarified the path of the people's judicial work, and gained profound experience in the practice of relying on the masses to handle cases, feeling that they have "found the door" in their work. This practical reform of the People's Courts has enabled the broad masses of the people to begin to actively participate in the people's judicial activities. In Chongqing, many citizens not only assist the People's Courts in investigating and mediating cases, but also automatically take responsibility for supervising the execution of cases mediated by the People's Courts.

During the construction phase of the movement, various localities generally relied on the masses to clear backlog cases and handle newly received cases, achieving remarkable results and creating many good experiences. The People's Courts above the provincial and municipal levels in the Northeast region adopted a method of combining on-site trials, collective mediation, and court trials appropriately, which not only changed the past phenomenon of back-and-forth correspondence between People's Courts at different levels and delays, but also made judgments more accurate than in the past due to the assistance and supervision of the masses. In East China, case-clearing committees were organized, case-clearing work groups were dispatched, and cadres from districts and townships and activists from the masses were organized into case-clearing teams to successfully resolve more than 150,000 cases. In the process of relying on the masses to handle cases, the masses were further mobilized. In Nanhui County, Jiangsu, the judicial work group reversed a case that the masses were most concerned about in Chengbei Township, and after suppressing the local tyrant landlord Zhu Bingchu in the case, the masses were generally mobilized. Many courts in various places also invite relevant agencies and organizations to participate in jury trials and cooperate in handling cases, changing the past phenomenon of "handling cases on a case-by-case basis" and enabling cases involving more problems to be thoroughly resolved. For example, when the Changsha Municipal People's Court handled the case of Xia Zhengxing Pharmacy owing rent for thirteen months due to a shortage of funds, if the case was handled simply by judging the pharmacy to pay the rent, it would inevitably lead to the unemployment of the pharmacy's employees. This time, in order to solve this problem, the court specially invited the Labor Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Trade Union, and both parties to jointly study the handling of the case. After analyzing the overall situation, everyone unanimously agreed that the pharmacy could not continue to operate, so the Industry and Commerce Bureau approved its closure, and the Trade Union and the Labor Bureau agreed that the employer would pay the dismissal fees in full before dismissing the employees, and the Labor Bureau would be responsible for solving the employees' future employment problems. The rent arrears were then cleared by auctioning off the furniture and inventory. This solved all the problems involved.

In the past, the People's Courts in some areas had created working methods to connect with the people. During the construction phase of the judicial reform movement, the People's Courts in various localities conscientiously summarized and learned from these advanced working experiences. For example, each village in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, established a mediation committee after 1946, which achieved many successes in its work and was well received by the masses. During the summer harvest period in May last year, the Chang'an County People's Court in Shaanxi Province, in order not to affect the production of the masses and to understand the mediation work in districts and townships, used the method of going to the countryside for circuit trials to clear a large number of backlog cases, while handling cases accurately and quickly, and being able to publicize policies and regulations to the masses at any time. According to the "Provincial Plan for Clearing Backlog Cases" formulated by the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government in June last year, the People's Courts at all levels in Jiangxi Province implemented circuit trials, going deep into the countryside and villages, "going to the homes," "going to the fields," and "going to the threshing grounds," using slack farming time to conduct investigations and interrogations, and absorbing the masses to participate in handling cases, solving the time conflict between handling cases and production. At the same time, new cases were handled in a timely manner, changing the past situation of treating clearing backlog cases as a purely crash task and accumulating them again after clearing them. These advanced working methods are being gradually promoted throughout the country. Now, the People's Courts in various places have begun to widely organize mass mediation and implement circuit trials.

In order to consolidate the achievements of judicial reform, the People's Courts in various localities have also carried out organizational and institutional construction during the construction phase of the movement. East China, Central-South, and other regions have decided to establish mediation committees in districts and townships. East China has now universally established democratically elected township mediation committees composed of five to nine people who do not leave production. Fujian Province has not only universally established mediation institutions, but is also vigorously training mediation committee members. While dealing with problems exposed by the masses, the Wuzhong City People's Court in Ningxia Province democratically elected 367 mediators and established 48 mediation groups based on administrative villages and 24 district and township mediation committees. The Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court decided to change the original organizational form of the court, spending two-thirds of its time and efforts going to the countryside for trials. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Court, from 1,500 letters of suggestions from the masses and rationalization proposals from internal staff of the court, gathered the opinions of the people and decided to handle cases in groups according to the nature of the cases; and established district People's Courts, street mediation groups, and inquiry offices, established people's jurors, and determined in the system to hold a mass representative symposium every three months to listen to the opinions of the masses. The court also decided to abolish the old summons and replace it with a three-part notice and use a tabular judgment; and strengthen publicity and education in judicial work through public trials, public pronouncements, and exhibitions. The People's Courts in various counties of the Chuxiong Prefecture in Yunnan Province also established a people's judicial representative conference system, regularly inviting activists, mediation committee members, and security committee members from the masses to hold meetings to solicit opinions on judicial work. In order to establish the banner of the people's judicial workers, some courts have also carried out the work of evaluating models. For example, the Nanjing Municipal People's Court selected 15 model workers at the meeting to summarize the judicial reform movement.

However, at present, the judicial reform movement in some areas, such as the Central-South region, is progressing slowly and has not yet achieved the expected results. The main reason is that some leading cadres in the Central-South judicial organs, such as Xu Fengxiao, Deputy Minister of the Central-South Ministry of Justice, and Lei Jingtian, President of the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, have old legal views and failed to take the lead in self-criticism, or their self-criticism was not thorough, which prevented them from guiding the movement well, thus causing the movement to be entangled in leadership for a long time and unable to be fully launched; or like Hunan, some leading cadres, such as Hu Guang, Vice President of the Provincial People's Court (now transferred), did not conduct self-criticism well and were "afraid of affecting the central work," and did not grasp judicial reform tightly, which led to the backwardness of the movement. On a national scale, there are still a few areas where the judicial reform movement has a "half-baked" phenomenon. The judicial organs in these areas only studied the documents in a formalistic way, or put on some empty labels, or made some general discussions, without mobilizing internal and external masses to thoroughly expose and criticize the old legal views; bad elements or even criminals who caused great public outrage who should have been cleared were not dealt with or brought to justice; at the same time, no new cadres were added, or the added cadres were very weak; and no new systems were established. As a result, these judicial organs were not strengthened. For example, most areas of Hunan, many areas of Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Rehe, 23 county People's Courts in North China, 16 county People's Courts in Northwest China, and some county People's Courts in Anhui and Sichuan all have this "half-baked" phenomenon. The higher-level leading organs of these courts must order them to conduct remedial lessons to seek the complete victory of judicial reform.

    全国大部地区司法改革工作已收实效
    少数地区有“夹生”现象还须进行补课
    现在全国大部分地区，司法改革运动的组织整顿与思想改造阶段已经基本结束，进入新的建设阶段；只有少数地区运动进展较慢，如中南区尚有一半地区须待一、二月间始能陆续完成。也有少数地区有“夹生”现象，需要继续深入进行。
    全国各地的司法改革运动，一般是正常的和健康的，基本上达到了整顿组织与改造思想的目的。大部地区在运动中惩办了少数过去曾经严重危害人民的坏分子，调动了一些犯有错误或不称职的旧司法人员的工作，同时把大批优秀的干部和工人、农民、青年、妇女调配到人民法院中工作。仅华东区不完全的统计，新补充到司法机关来的即有二千一百多人。西南区为了加强人民法院的领导力量，全区已有百分之七十五以上的县配备了专职的人民法院院长。这些从人民群众中直接提升起来或从其他工作岗位调来的人民司法干部，大部分都有明确的立场、观点，对工作积极热情，善于联系群众。他们经过学习和发动群众参加办案的实际工作，已迅速地熟习了业务。各地许多原有的司法干部由于划清了新旧法律的界限，明确了人民司法工作的道路，并在依靠群众办案的实践中得到了深刻的体会，工作信心也大为加强，觉得在工作上“摸着门了”。人民法院的这种实际的改革，使广大人民群众开始积极参加人民司法活动。重庆市有不少市民一面协助人民法院调查和调解案件，一面对人民法院调解成立的案件自动负责监督执行。
    各地在运动的建设阶段，一般都曾依靠群众清理积案和处理新收案件，获得了显著的成绩，并创造了许多好的经验。东北区省、市以上人民法院采用就地审判、集体调解和法庭审判适当结合的方法，不仅改变了过去上下级人民法院文来文往、拖延时日的现象，且由于获得了群众的协助和监督，判案也比过去准确了。华东各地组织了清案委员会，派出清案工作组，联合区、乡干部及群众中的积极分子组织清案队伍顺利地解决了十五万多件案件。在依靠群众办案的过程中，又进一步发动了群众。江苏南汇县司法工作组在城北乡改判了一件群众最关心的案件，镇压了案中恶霸地主朱丙初以后，群众就普遍地被发动起来。各地还有不少法院在办案中邀请有关机关、团体参加陪审和配合办案，改变了过去“就案办案”的现象，使牵涉问题较多的案件得到了彻底的解决。如长沙市人民法院处理夏正兴药铺因资金短绌，亏欠房租十三个月，房东诉请追租的案件时，如按过去的审判方法“就案办案”，简单判决药铺清付房租，则势必引起药铺职工失业。这次该院为解决这一问题，特邀集劳动局、工商局、工会及双方当事人共同研究处理。分析了全盘情况后，大家一致认定药铺无法继续维持，遂由工商局批准歇业，工会、劳动局同意由资方发足解雇费后将职工解雇，职工以后工作问题则由劳动局负责解决，房租欠额则尽拍卖家具及存货清还。这就使所有牵涉的问题，都得到了解决。
    一部分地区的人民法院在过去工作中曾创造了联系人民群众的工作方法。在司法改革运动的建设阶段，各地人民法院认真地总结和学习了这些先进的工作经验。如山西省平顺县各村从一九四六年以后即建立了调解委员会，工作中有很多成绩，深受群众欢迎。陕西省长安县人民法院在去年五月夏收期间，为了不影响群众生产并了解区、乡调解工作情况，曾用下乡巡回就审的方法，清理了大批积案，同时办案准确迅速，并能随时向群众宣传政策法令。江西省各级人民法院根据去年六月江西省人民政府所订的“全省清理积案工作计划”，实行巡回就审，深入乡、村，“上家”、“上田”、“上场”，利用农闲空隙进行调查、讯问，并吸收群众参加办案，解决了办案与生产在时间上的矛盾。同时及时处理了新收案件，改变了过去把清理积案作为单纯的突击工作、清理后又积压的情况。以上这些先进的工作方法，正在全国逐步推广。现在，各地人民法院已开始广泛地组织群众调解和实行巡回就审。
    为了巩固司法改革的成果，各地人民法院在运动的建设阶段，又进行了组织与制度的建设。华东、中南等区都决定在区、乡设立调解委员会。华东现已普遍建立了民选的、不脱离生产的五人至九人组成的乡调解委员会。福建省不仅普遍建立了调解机构，并正大力训练调解委员。宁夏省吴忠市人民法院在处理群众揭发出来的问题的同时，即以民主选举方式选出了三百六十七个调解员，成立了四十八个以行政村为单位的调解小组和二十四个区、乡调解委员会。石家庄市人民法院决定改变法院原来的组织形式，以三分之二的时间和力量下乡就审。广州市人民法院从一千五百件群众建议性函件及法院内部工作人员的合理化建议中，集中了人民群众的意见，决定按案件性质分组办案；并建立区人民法院、街调解组及问事处，设立人民陪审员，在制度上确定每三个月召开一次群众代表座谈会，听取群众意见。该院还决定废除旧传票，改用三联通知单和使用表格式的判决书；并将通过公审、公开宣判和举办展览会等方式，加强司法工作中的宣传教育工作。云南省楚雄专区各县人民法院还建立了人民司法代表会议制度，定期邀请群众中的积极分子、调解委员、治安委员等开会，征集对司法工作的意见。为了树立人民司法工作者的旗帜，有些法院还进行了评选模范的工作。如南京市人民法院在总结司法改革运动的会议上，选出模范工作者十五人。
    但是，目前有一些地区，如中南区的司法改革运动进展较慢，仍未取得预期的成效。其主要原因，是由于中南司法机关中某些领导干部，如中南司法部副部长徐风笑及最高人民法院中南分院院长雷经天等，自己有旧法观点，又未能带头检讨，或检讨不彻底，致不能很好地指导运动，因而使运动长期纠缠在领导上面，不能全面展开；或者像湖南那样，由于某些领导干部，如省人民法院副院长胡光（现已调工作）自己未好好检讨，又“怕影响中心工作”，对司法改革抓得不紧，以致运动落后。在全国范围内，还有少数地区的司法改革运动发生“夹生”现象。这些地区的司法机关仅形式主义地学习了一下文件，或空扣了一些帽子，或泛泛作些讨论，而未发动内外群众对旧法观点作彻底的揭露和批判；对应清除的坏分子甚至民愤大的犯罪分子也未予处理或法办；同时没有补充新的干部或补充的干部能力很弱；更未建立新的制度。结果这些司法机关就没有加强。如湖南的大部地区，广西、浙江、热河的许多地区，华北有二十三个县人民法院，西北有十六个县人民法院，以及安徽和四川的一些县人民法院，都有此类“夹生”现象。这些法院的上级领导机关必须责令他们切实进行补课，以求司法改革的彻底胜利。
