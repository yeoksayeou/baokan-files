Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: American aggressors are actively organizing an Asian aggression bloc and stepping up preparations for military adventures. Under American direction, the South Korean puppet Syngman Rhee, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang are colluding. Syngman Rhee has already visited Japan. In a statement he issued upon leaving Japan, he admitted that, under the supervision of U.S. Far East Commander Clark and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Murphy, he discussed "major issues" with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida that "the United States also attaches great importance to." According to Agence France-Presse, this so-called "major issue" is how to "assume joint responsibility for defense against the Communists."

While in Japan, Syngman Rhee met with Tung Hsien-kuang, the Chiang Kai-shek gang's ambassador to Japan, at Clark's headquarters. Agence France-Presse reported that the two men discussed the issue of the Chiang Kai-shek gang "contributing to the Korean War." After Syngman Rhee left Japan, Yoshida summoned Japan's ambassador to the Chiang Kai-shek gang, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, back to Japan to discuss the Far East "situation"; at the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek gang's Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao also rushed to Japan from the United States. Yeh Kung-chao held talks with Yoshida and Japanese Foreign Minister Okazaki. According to Agence France-Presse, Yeh Kung-chao has reached an agreement with the Japanese government to "strengthen their cooperation in the future" between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

The purpose of the American aggressors directing the reactionary Japanese government, Syngman Rhee, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to engage in such collusion is to organize them into an aggression bloc in order to use them to continue and expand the Korean War and implement Eisenhower's plan of "using Asians to fight Asians." An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th pointed out: The U.S. directing this puppet show shows that Eisenhower's guiding strategic plan in the Far East—establishing a "Far East anti-Communist united front"—is already underway. Encouraged by the United States, this group of puppets is eager to try. According to the Associated Press, Shigeru Yoshida has openly stated that he guarantees Japan will conduct "unlimited cooperation" to help resolve the Korean War. The Chiang gang also clamored that Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang "must cooperate."

In addition, according to British sources, American aggressors are also preparing to establish an aggression organization throughout Southeast Asia. Britain's "Daily Mail" recently reported that since U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force attachés in Taiwan visited Indochina and Malaya, the United States has directed the proposal to establish a so-called "Southeast Asia Allied Military Committee." The United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and France will send representatives to participate, and the headquarters may be located in Singapore. The British official propaganda organ, the British Information Service, confirmed this news on the 9th, quoting an "authoritative source" who said, "Britain will soon invite Australia and New Zealand to participate in a council for unified planning of the anti-Communist war in the Far East. The countries participating in the council are France and the United States. … It may be a military organization with political advisors attached."

Simultaneous with all these conspiracies, American aggressors are stepping up preparations for military adventures to continue and expand the Korean War. According to the Associated Press, ten senior U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force generals in Korea, including Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet, Fifth Air Force Commander Barcus, Seventh Fleet Commander Clark, and U.S. Amphibious Operations Force Far East Commander Wissington, held a military conference on the U.S. battleship "Missouri" in Incheon, Korea, on the 5th to discuss "important combat issues." American aggressors, with the assistance of the British government, are also plotting a conspiracy to launch an invasion of our country from the south. Chase, the head of the U.S. military advisory group stationed with the bandit gang in Taiwan, suddenly went to Hong Kong on the 6th, followed by British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald, and French Far East Naval Commander Auboyneau. Also arriving in Hong Kong were U.S. Far East Naval Aircraft Carrier Fifth Division Commander Hickey and British Far East Naval Deputy Commander Clifford. Although Hong Kong officials tried their best to block the news, Agence France-Presse revealed that "Chase went to Hong Kong to discuss with the British authorities the issue of the U.S. Navy blockading the Chinese mainland." According to Hong Kong newspapers, Chase also inspected the British military facilities in Kowloon and the New Territories, and visited the Tiu Keng Leng "refugee camp" that houses Kuomintang remnants. All these conspiratorial activities by American aggressors to expand the Far East war cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the Chinese people and the Asian people.

### 美国侵略者积极筹组亚洲地区侵略集团  指使李承晚、吉田及国民党匪帮进行勾结

    美国侵略者积极筹组亚洲地区侵略集团
    指使李承晚、吉田及国民党匪帮进行勾结
    【新华社十三日讯】美国侵略者正在积极筹组亚洲地区的侵略集团，并加紧准备军事冒险。在美国导演之下，南朝鲜傀儡李承晚、日本吉田反动政府和国民党匪帮之间正在进行勾结。李承晚已经访问了日本，他在他离开日本时发表的声明中承认，他在美国远东总司令克拉克和美国驻日大使墨菲的监督之下，和日本首相吉田商谈了“美国也很重视”的“重大问题”。这个所谓“重大问题”，据法新社透露，就是如何“对防御共产党方面负起共同责任”。
    李承晚在日本的时候，曾经和国民党匪帮驻日本的大使董显光在克拉克总部举行了会谈，法新社报道说，他们两人谈到了国民党匪帮“对朝鲜战争出力的问题”。在李承晚离开日本以后，吉田召日本驻在国民党匪帮的大使芳泽谦吉回国，讨论远东“大局”；同时国民党匪帮的外交部长叶公超也由美国赶到日本。叶公超和吉田以及日本外相冈崎举行了会谈。据法新社报道，叶公超已经和日本政府获得协议，决定日本和国民党匪帮“在将来加强他们的合作”。
    美国侵略者指使日本反动政府和李承晚以及国民党匪帮进行这种勾勾搭搭，其目的是要把他们组织成一个侵略集团，以便在继续和扩大朝鲜战争中使用他们，实现艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划。美联社东京八日电指出：美国导演这一幕傀儡戏，说明艾森豪威尔在远东的主导的战略计划——建立“远东反共联合战线”——已经在着手进行。在美国的鼓励之下，这一帮傀儡正在跃跃欲试。据美联社报道，吉田茂已经公开表示他保证日本进行“无限的合作”以帮助解决朝鲜战争。蒋匪也叫嚣日本、南朝鲜与国民党匪帮之间“必须合作”。
    除此之外，据英国方面透露，美国侵略者还准备建立整个东南亚地区的侵略组织。英国的“每日邮报”最近报道说，自从美国在台湾的陆、空、海军武官访问印度支那和马来亚以后，美国已经指使提议设立所谓“东南亚盟国军事委员会”。美国、澳大利亚、新西兰、英国和法国都将派代表参加，总部可能设在新加坡。英国官方宣传机关英国新闻处在九日引一位“权威人士”的话证实了这个消息，这个人说，“英国不久即将邀请澳大利亚和新西兰参加一个统一策划远东的反共战争的理事会。参加理事会的国家有法国和美国。……它可能是一个附有政治顾问的军事组织。”
    与所有这些阴谋活动同时，美国侵略者正在加紧准备继续和扩大朝鲜战争的军事冒险。据美联社报道，美国在朝鲜的十名陆海空军高级将领，包括第八军军长范佛里特，第五航空队司令巴喀斯，第七舰队司令克拉克，美国两栖作战部队远东司令威辛顿等，曾于五日在朝鲜仁川海面美国“密苏里”号战舰上举行军事会议，讨论“重要的战斗问题”。美国侵略者也正在英国政府的协助下，策动一种从南面对我国进行侵略活动的阴谋。美国派在台湾匪帮的军事顾问团团长蔡斯，在六日突然前往香港，接着英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳，和法国远东海军司令奥布瓦诺也到了香港。到达香港的还有美国驻远东海军航空母舰第五分队司令希凯，和英国驻远东海军副司令克利弗德。虽然香港官方竭力封锁消息，但是法新社透露，“蔡斯到香港去是为了和英国当局商谈有关美国海军封锁中国大陆的问题”。据香港报纸报道，蔡斯还曾经视察了九龙新界的英军军事设备，并访问了收容国民党残匪的调景岭“难民营”。美国侵略者这一切扩大远东战争的阴谋活动，不能不引起中国人民和亚洲人民的高度警觉。
