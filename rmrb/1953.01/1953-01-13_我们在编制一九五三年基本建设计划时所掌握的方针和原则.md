As of the end of 1952, the general situation of factory and mine construction within the scope of the Ministry of Heavy Industry was: the restoration and adjustment of old factories had basically ended, and large-scale key construction had begun. However, leading cadres at all levels had not paid enough attention to basic construction, had not paid attention to the training of design and construction forces, and had not vigorously prepared for the construction conditions of new factories, such as resource exploration, transportation, and electricity. On the other hand, the state's requirements for us were very urgent, requiring us to quickly concentrate our forces on basic construction and engage in large-scale factory and mine construction, so that the production level of means of production, which is the foundation of industry, could be multiplied in a few years.

Based on the state's requirements and on the existing foundation, our guiding principle for compiling the 1953 basic construction plan was: 1. Quickly prepare conditions for the construction of new factories, first of all resource exploration, transportation, and electricity; 2. Strive to strengthen design forces and construction forces, and pay attention to the training of reserve forces; 3. Concentrate manpower and material resources on key construction.

Based on the above guidelines, we have determined the following principles for compiling the plan:

	1. The design and preparatory workload cannot be included in the plan if the construction conditions are not complete: For example, to build a new factory, resource exploration must be done first, and there must be sufficient geological data for design needs; otherwise, the design cannot be started. In addition, electricity and transportation conditions must also be considered. If there is a problem with transportation, equipment cannot be transported in. Without power, not only can production not be carried out, but construction cannot be carried out in the first place. Therefore, electricity and transportation conditions, as well as the timing of coordination with construction, have become important conditions for us to build new factories. If resource exploration and electricity and transportation conditions are not available, we should start by preparing these conditions.

	2. Construction workload shall not be included in the plan if the design work has not been completed and the construction force has not been prepared. Without design, there can be no construction. With design, without construction force, there can be no construction either. Such units should actively do a good job in design and preparation of construction forces, and should not be busy asking for construction investment.

	3. Regardless of the renovation of large or small factories, no construction should be carried out arbitrarily within the original site before the overall design is made. Adhering to this principle means adhering to thrift. Because if it is built now, it may have to be demolished in the future. Every factory that has been decided to be renovated must first make an overall design; this is for better and more rational construction. Secondly, in the past two years, almost every factory and mine under the Ministry of Heavy Industry has had some investment every year. That is to say, each production unit is also a basic construction unit at the same time. In the future, it is determined that except for a few old factories that are planned to be renovated, the issues related to production technology improvement in general production units will be included in the production technology organization plan for resolution.

	4. Sufficient conditions should be given to resource exploration work to ensure its smooth progress and to obtain the greatest results.

	5. The greatest attention must be paid to the training of reserve forces, especially secondary technical schools and technical worker schools. This is very important to whether construction can be carried out in the future and whether factories can start production after completion.

	6. Conditions must be given to design companies and engineering companies for rapid growth and development.

	7. Financial resources, material resources, and human resources must be concentrated on a few decisive construction units so that they can complete the construction tasks on time or ahead of schedule and put them into production as soon as possible; so that the country can obtain the most urgently needed means of production as soon as possible to facilitate future construction.

The above explains what kind of construction to invest in, what kind of construction not to invest in; what kind of construction to invest more in, what kind of construction to invest less in; what kind of construction to invest in early, what kind of construction to invest in late. Solving these problems ideologically will help us correctly implement the 1953 basic construction plan.

    我们在编制一九五三年基本建设计划时所掌握的方针和原则
    重工业部计划司司长　徐驰
    截至一九五二年底，重工业部范围内厂矿建设的总情况是：旧厂的恢复与调整工作已基本上结束，较大规模的重点建设已经开始。但是，各级领导干部对基本建设还没有予以足够的重视，对设计和施工力量还没有注意培养，对新厂的建设条件，如资源勘探、交通及电力等还没有大力准备。而另一方面，国家对我们的要求又十分迫切，要求我们把力量迅速集中到基本建设方面来，从事大规模的厂矿建设，以便在几年后使作为工业基础的生产资料的生产水平成倍地增长。
    根据国家这样的要求，在已有的基础上，我们编订一九五三年基本建设计划的方针是：一、迅速为新厂建设准备条件，首先是资源勘探、交通和电力；二、努力壮大设计力量和施工力量，并注意后备力量的培养；三、集中人力物力于重点建设。
    根据上述方针，我们确定了下列几个编订计划的原则：
    一、建厂条件不完备的，不能将设计和筹备的工作量列入计划：如建设新厂，必须首先做过资源勘探工作，有足够的设计需要的地质资料，否则不能动手设计。此外，还需考虑电力与交通条件。交通有问题，设备运不进去。没有动力，则非但不能生产，首先就不能建设。所以电力与交通条件，以及配合建设在时间上的先后，都成为我们建设新厂的重要条件。没有具备资源勘探和电力交通条件的，应该先从准备这些条件着手。
    二、没有做完设计工作和没有准备好施工力量的，概不能将施工工作量列入计划。没有设计，不能施工。有了设计，没有施工力量，也不能施工。这样的单位应该积极做好设计和准备施工力量的工作，不要忙于要求施工投资。
    三、无论大厂或小厂的改建，没有做出总体设计之前，不应在原厂址内随意进行建筑。坚持这个原则，就是坚持节约。因为现在盖了，将来可能还要拆除。每个已决定要改建的工厂，必须先作总体设计；这是为了更好地、更合理地进行建筑。其次，两年来重工业部所属各厂矿，几乎每个单位每年都多少有些投资。也就是说，每个生产单位同时又是基本建设单位。今后确定除了几个有计划改建的旧厂外，一般生产单位有关生产技术改进的问题一律列入生产技术组织计划内解决。
    四、对资源勘探工作，应给予充足的条件，保证其顺利进行和求得最大的成果。
    五、对后备力量的培养，特别是中等技术学校和技工学校，必须给以最大的注意。这和今后能否建设和工厂建成后能否开工生产有很重要的关系。六、要给设计公司和工程公司以迅速生长与壮大的条件。
    七、要集中财力、物力与人力于少数有决定意义的建设单位，使能按时或提前完成建设任务，早日投入生产；使国家早日获得最急需的生产资料，以利今后的建设。
    上面说明了对什么样的建设投资，什么样的建设不投资；什么样的建设多投资，什么样的建设少投资；什么样的建设早投资，什么样的建设晚投资。从思想上解决了这些问题，将有助于我们正确地执行一九五三年基本建设计划。
