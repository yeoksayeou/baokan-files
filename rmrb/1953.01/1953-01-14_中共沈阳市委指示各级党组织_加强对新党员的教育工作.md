The Organization Department of the CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee promptly presented its opinions to the affiliated party organizations regarding strengthening the education of new party members during the period of party building. The Shenyang Municipal Committee pointed out: Conducting Marxist-Leninist education for new party members is one of the most important tasks of party organizations. The Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates that "the role of the probationary period for probationary members is to enable probationers to receive preliminary party education and to ensure that the party organization examines the political qualities of the probationers in their work." This means that party organizations must, from the day a new party member joins the party, constantly care for their political and ideological growth and help them improve their Marxist-Leninist level, so that they can become staunch communist fighters. However, in the past, some party organizations paid very little attention to the political and ideological education of new party members, and many probationary members had already passed their probationary period without completing the procedures to become full party members. This shows that there are shortcomings in the work of these party organizations. In the current process of accepting a large number of new party members, the number of new party members is increasing day by day, so strengthening their education and inspection work has become an important task of party organizations that cannot be ignored.

How to strengthen it? The Shenyang Municipal Committee put forward the following opinions: First, use spare time to run short-term training classes for new party members, or use weekly party days to give party lessons, to systematically educate new party members on basic party knowledge. Shenyang Machinery Factory No. 1 and Factory No. 7, after developing a group of new party members, adopted the method of running training classes for new party members, systematically explaining the Program and Constitution of the Communist Party of China. After such education, the organization and discipline of the new party members were strengthened, enabling them to consciously play an active role in various tasks. Second, in accordance with the principle of assigning party work to each party member, assign them certain work tasks to train their spirit of overcoming difficulties in their work and strengthen their sense of responsibility for party work. After assigning tasks, the branch should pay attention to checking the completion of their work tasks and provide concrete help in a timely manner. Third, designate formal party members (or introducers) to provide individual assistance to probationary members, teach them work methods at any time, improve their work ability, and practically examine their performance and political qualities in various tasks and movements. Fourth, strengthen organizational life. It is necessary to hold group meetings and branch meetings frequently so that each probationary member lives a strict organizational life from the day they join the party. Through meetings, use the method of criticism and self-criticism to cultivate their uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings and a high degree of strict self-discipline, and constantly urge themselves to play a exemplary role in various tasks.

The Shenyang Municipal Committee also particularly pointed out: The probationary period of probationary party members is by no means a formality, but is intended to subject probationary party members to extremely strict tests during this period. Therefore, party committees at all levels must urge their affiliated branches to improve various systems and to regularly check and summarize the work of educating and inspecting new party members.

    中共沈阳市委指示各级党组织
    加强对新党员的教育工作
    中共沈阳市委组织部曾在建党期间及时地向所属的党组织提出了关于加强对新党员教育的意见。沈阳市委指出：对新党员进行马克思列宁主义的教育是党组织最重要的工作之一。中国共产党党章上规定：“候补党员候补期的作用，是使候补人接受初步的党的教育，并在工作中保证党的组织考察候补人的政治品质。”这就是说，党组织必须从新党员入党那一天起，就对他们在政治上、思想上的成长，给予不断的关怀，并帮助他们提高马克思列宁主义水平，使他们成为坚强的共产主义战士。但是，过去有的党组织对新党员的政治思想教育工作注意很差，许多候补党员早已过了候补期，还没有办理转为正式党员的手续。这说明了这些党组织的工作是存在着缺点的。在目前大量接收新党员的过程中，新党员的数量日益增多，因此加强对他们的教育与考察工作已成为党组织一项重要的不容忽视的工作。
    如何加强呢？沈阳市委提出了如下的意见：第一、利用业余时间开办短期的新党员训练班，或利用每周的党日讲党课，对新党员进行系统的关于党的基础知识的教育。沈阳机械一厂和七厂在发展一批新党员以后，采取开办新党员训练班的方式，系统地讲解了中国共产党党纲和党章。经过这样的教育以后，加强了新党员的组织性和纪律性，使他们在各种工作中自觉地发挥了积极性。第二、按照分配每个党员作党的工作的原则，分配给他们一定的工作任务，以锻炼他们在工作中克服困难的精神，加强他们对党的工作的责任感。分配任务后，支部应注意检查他们完成工作任务的情况，并及时给予具体帮助。第三、指定正式党员（或介绍人）对候补党员进行个别帮助，随时教给他们工作方法，提高他们的工作能力，并在各种工作和运动中切实地考察他们的表现与政治品质。第四、加强组织生活。要经常开小组会、支部大会，使每个候补党员从入党那一天起，就过着严格的组织生活。通过会议，以批评和自我批评的方法，养成他们对缺点不妥协的作风和高度的严格要求自己的精神，时刻促使自己在各种工作中起模范作用。
    沈阳市委并特别指出：候补党员的候补期绝不是一种形式，而是要使候补党员在这一期间受到极严格的考验。所以各级党委必须督促所属支部，健全各种制度，并要经常对教育、考察新党员的工作加以检查和总结。
