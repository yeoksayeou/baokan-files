Six, "Engineers' and Technicians' Club"

In the provisions of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan, the following task was put forward: "To ensure the continuous advancement of technology in all sectors of the Soviet national economy is a necessary condition for a powerful surge in production and an increase in labor productivity. For this reason, technological progress must not only catch up with but also surpass foreign scientific achievements in the near future."

The Five-Year Plan included a concrete and scientifically grounded program for developing technology. It raised the issue of mastering new machines, mechanizing various heavy labor tasks, automating production processes, and continuing to develop the electrification of industry and agriculture.

Technological progress promoted the improvement of production organization, shortened production processes, promoted the use of automatic conveyors and other advanced technologies, increased the production volume of individual machines, and laid the foundation for high-speed machine tool operations, etc.

Soviet local newspapers played an important role in promoting technological progress. The newspapers tirelessly strived to promote the implementation of the latest technological achievements in production. While widely publicizing the importance of technological progress and improving technical experience, the newspapers also waged a resolute struggle against backwardness and individual leaders in enterprises who stubbornly clung to old technologies.

The "Pacific Star" newspaper in the Khabarovsk Territory paid close attention to the issues of technological improvement and development, and added a "Engineers' and Technicians' Club" column.

The "Pacific Star" newspaper required engineers and technicians in various enterprises in the territory to write articles for the newspaper on new creations in production technology, new methods of labor organization, experiences in technical norms, and organizational methods of Stakhanovite collective work, etc.

Comrade Galyankin, a teacher and engineer from the Department of Metalworking Technology at the Khabarovsk Railway Transport Engineering Institute, was the first to publish an article in the "Engineers' and Technicians' Club" column. He pointed out that engineers in Khabarovsk factories were showing a lack of initiative in adopting new production methods that were already well-known domestically.

Comrade Kachilin, the chief engineer of the Khabarovsk Assembly and Design Management Office, Comrade Chenigin, an engineer from the "Fisheries Industry Machinery Corporation," a famous inventor of fishing pumps and winner of the Stalin Prize, and others, published articles in the "Engineers' and Technicians' Club" column about their experiences in the struggle for technological progress. Engineer Alexandrovsky raised the issue of the role of workshop directors and their initiatives in striving for technological progress. Engineer Kuznetsov analyzed the work experience of a factory's technical research office...

In many enterprises in the territory, great achievements were made in the adoption of high-speed metal cutting methods. Comrade Shulemetov, the head of the technical department of a factory, published his views on this issue in the "Engineers' and Technicians' Club" column. He described the method of using high-speed cutting on lathes and provided the theoretical basis for the new method. This article attracted the attention of a large number of readers. Good methods of using high-speed cutting in other enterprise departments in the territory were also quickly reported to the editorial department. Soon, Engineer Grachev also wrote an article on this issue in the column, reporting on the experience of high-speed technical workers.

The articles published in the "Engineers' and Technicians' Club" column had various forms and expressions. For example, under the title "Technical Experience Exchange," short news items were published on various industrial technological improvement processes that had been implemented in various enterprise departments in the territory. For example, after a news item about rationalization proposals for applying metal cutting methods using electric arcs was published, Comrade Krivobalov, an engineer from the Zavyazkinsky Locomotive Depot, wrote a communication to the newspaper in response to this short news item, describing how the metal cutting method using electric arcs was applied in the locomotive depot. Subsequently, this method was rapidly and systematically applied to metal cutting in locomotive depots of the Far Eastern Railway and in other enterprise departments in the territory.

The column also published communications such as "Methods for Preventing Metal Corrosion," "Mechanized Painting Methods," and "Improvements in Oil Filtration," each occupying forty to sixty lines, reporting to workers in enterprise departments on improved working methods and explaining how these improvements led to increased labor productivity and reduced costs.

The "Engineers' and Technicians' Club" column also used the title "Communications from Enterprises and New Construction Projects" to publish communications from technical personnel, and also opened a "Our Mailbox" column, in which technical personnel's communications on various production work issues were published.

Seven, "Fulfill Promises!"

The workers and activists in the scientific and technological fields of the industrial sector of Leningrad City and Leningrad Oblast, in a letter to Comrade Stalin in April 1949, stated that they would achieve continuous development of advanced technology on the basis of the solid friendship between scientific and production workers.

The letter to Comrade Stalin became the fighting program of all workers, farmers, engineers, technicians, scholars, and scientific workers in Leningrad Oblast.

The "Leningrad Truth" newspaper explained to the laborers the political and economic significance of the Leningraders' initiative on developing advanced technology, and the newspaper carried out enormous work for unfolding the competition between production and scientific workers to victoriously realize their important obligations.

The newspaper raised various different issues. The editorial department was concerned about the improvement and role of design offices, technical departments, experimental workshops, factory laboratories, and so on. At the same time, the editorial department paid close attention to the issue of rapidly implementing the suggestions of inventors and rationalization proposers into production to rapidly design and manufacture the latest technically advanced machines and equipment.

The "Leningrad Truth" newspaper called on the workers in the industrial sector to fight for the adoption of assembly line operations, high-speed metal cutting, high-speed smelting, and the application of advanced technologies such as highly efficient production equipment and tools. The newspaper supported and promoted the lofty efforts of Soviet scholars and scientific workers to strengthen ties with enterprise workers, help production innovators to improve technical work and improve the economic indicators of factory work.

The scientific and technological conference at the Kirov Electric Power Plant to discuss the issue of friendship and cooperation between workers and scientific activists was a significant event. Representatives from thirty-seven of the largest universities and scientific research institutes in Leningrad and Moscow participated in the work of the conference. Before the opening of the conference, the scholars systematically learned about the situation of the factory and studied the status quo in this regard, and they also went to the workshops to visit. Famous scientific activists—nearly one hundred doctors and masters of technical science, physical-mathematical science, and chemical science—gave speeches at the conference, recounting the future prospects of the factory. A total of one thousand three hundred and seven people participated in the conference. The "Leningrad Truth" newspaper reported on their work. The experience of the electric power plant workers was conveyed to the enterprises of many other cities at the conference.

The activities of the academic conferences of the research institutes were also significantly improved, and engineers and Stakhanov workers in industry participated in their conferences. The "Leningrad Truth" newspaper reported on such academic conferences of the research institutes in many articles. The newspaper wrote: "Last April, for the first time in the history of higher technical education, an academic report was given by a Stakhanov worker from a sowing machine manufacturing factory to the students of the Lin Suwei Institute."

Since then, the reports of the Stakhanov workers have become an integral part of the curriculum of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Comrade Bolatnov, a famous Stakhanov-style mechanical worker, and Comrade Temitriev, a designer, have become lecturers teaching students.

The newspaper's coverage of this report aroused the attention of workers in higher education institutions in other cities across the country. Higher education institutions in Moscow, Kiev, Sverdlovsk, and Kuibyshev also followed the example of Leningrad and regularly invited innovators in industry and agriculture to give reports. The Soviet Minister of Higher Education approved this initiative and introduced this method widely to various higher education institutions.

The movement to strive for the establishment of a creative friendship between scientific and production workers raised the enthusiasm of various engineering and technical academic groups, and the members of these societies helped the implementation of technical improvements in enterprises and participated in the work of production technology conferences and factory and workshop technical meetings. The scholars of Leningrad also helped technical work cadres to improve their professional level in every way. Doctor of Mathematics Polo Gofeyev proposed a meaningful initiative. According to his proposal, a study class on the spectral analysis of ferrous and non-ferrous metals was organized in the "Technicians' Home" for technical workers in enterprises.

The newspaper editorial department promoted new technological progress in enterprises and made the experience of production innovators its own thing for the broad masses. Under the topic of "New Things in the Struggle for Technological Progress," the newspaper reported various materials. At the same time, the editorial department received letters from workers and scientific workers in the industrial sector responding to articles and new suggestions published in the newspaper every day.

The editorial department also specially opened a column called "Following the 'Leningrad Truth' speech, expand the front line of technological progress."

The newspaper wrote: "In this column, many letters sent to the editorial department are published. These letters involve issues in various aspects. One of them recounts advanced production experience; another part points out the phenomenon of technological backwardness, conservatism, and stubbornness, and sharply criticizes the work of some enterprise leaders; the third aspect raises new questions to scientific and production workers. All these communications are permeated with one idea: that we must not be satisfied with the initial achievements, and we should use all methods to expand the front line of struggle for technological progress!

"These letters are a reflection of the recent articles published in the 'Leningrad Truth,' such as the communication on the rapid smelting method of steelmaking technician Mishina, the communication on the outstanding achievements of ironworkers Krasnoumov and Chigalev; such as the communication on the mechanization of casting work by Hua Xilie·Odinchaev, the special article on 'Spectral Analysis Laboratory in the Factory'; and Professor Lebedev's communication 'Why is the mastery of new and reviewed technologies so slow,' etc. "Every enterprise should greatly open its doors to welcome all new and progressive things. This is what every article in the readers' letters published in the newspaper calls for. Their ideas and suggestions should be vividly reflected by scientific and technological workers, engineers and technicians, craftsmen, and Stakhanov workers. Now, for the people of Leningrad, no task is more important than fulfilling the promise of the tasks put forward in the letter to Comrade Stalin." The newspaper ended its article with these words.

Three days later, the newspaper returned to the issue it had raised. The "Leningrad Truth" newspaper reminded everyone in its "Should Practice Promises" column: Fair criticism helped enterprise leaders to explore correct practical conclusions. Valuable suggestions were discussed or adopted. Their replies to recent published articles and their promises have been published in the "Leningrad Truth".

The articles published in the newspaper are powerful public opinion. For example, Solovyov, the director of the steel melting workshop of the Kirov Factory, Garminsky, the workshop engineer, and Murchizhi, the steelmaking technician, raised specific requirements to the factory leaders in the communication "What Hinders Rapid Smelting". Professor Polo Gofeyev wrote a letter "Talking About Spectral Analysis Again", hoping to hear the opinions of many leaders in Leningrad enterprises and universities. Now, it is important to make this public opinion not only play a constant supervisory role, but also effectively help enterprise leaders implement their obligations.

"Practice Promises!" This sentence calls for a struggle for technological progress in the Leningrad industrial production sector, and calls for the completion of the tasks put forward in the letter written by the people of Leningrad themselves to Comrade Stalin.

The creative friendship of scientific and production workers fighting for technological progress is growing vigorously and achieving good results. Readers of the "Leningrad Truth" reported on the achievements made in this great cause.

Factories and workshops in the Kirov District of Leningrad have established contacts with twenty-four universities and many scientific research institutes. The people of the Kirov District are mastering new combined machines, new machines, new equipment, and various new tools for mass production day by day. They have adopted rapid and assembly line operations on a wider scale, and have mechanized and automated the production process.

The Kirov Electric Power Plant required scientific research institutes and vocational schools to help them draft a grand plan for the development of the factory. The scholars enthusiastically responded to this request. Two corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences, twenty-six scientific doctors, fifty-six scientific masters, and seventy-eight scientific workers participated in the design work for the development of the factory. Scientific workers provided many valuable instructions and opinions. The factory has formulated a precise plan to adopt new technologies in all production sectors.

    苏联地方报纸在进行工业报道中联系实际联系群众的一些经验
    鲍碇　江虹
    六、“工程师与技师俱乐部”
    在苏联战后五年计划的规定中，提出了这样一个任务：“在苏联国民经济一切部门中保证技术的不断的进步，是强大的生产高涨和提高劳动生产率的必要条件，为此必须使技术的进步不仅赶上而且要在最近期间超过国外的科学的成就。”
    在五年计划里，包含了具体而有科学根据的发展技术的纲领。这里提出了掌握新机器的熟练程度问题，各种沉重劳动的机械化问题，以及生产过程自动化和继续发展工业与农业电气化的问题。
    技术的进步促进了生产组织的改善，缩短了生产过程，促进了自动传带和其他先进技术的运用，提高了单个机器的生产量，奠定了机床工作的快速制度等等。
    苏联地方报纸在宣传技术进步方面，起了重要的作用。报纸不屈不挠地为在生产中实施最新的技术成就而努力进行宣传。和广泛宣传技术进步的重要性及提高技术的经验同时，报纸和一切落后性以及对于新技术抱顽固态度的企业中个别的领导人，进行了坚决的斗争。
    伯力边区报纸“太平洋之星”报非常注意技术的改进与发展问题，报纸上增辟了“工程师与技师俱乐部”栏。
    “太平洋之星”报要求边区各企业里的工程师和技师们给报纸撰写关于生产技术的新创造，劳动组织的新方法，技术定额的经验和斯塔哈诺夫式集体工作的组织方法等等问题的文章。
    伯力铁路运输工程师研究所五金工艺学系的教员、工程师加良金同志第一个在“工程师与技师俱乐部”栏里发表文章。他指出：伯力的工厂的工程师对于已在国内闻名的新生产方法的采用，表现得没有力量。
    伯力装配设计管理处总工程师卡乞林同志、“渔业工业机器总公司”的工程师、著名的捕鱼唧筒发明者、斯大林奖金获得者车尼金同志等，都在“工程师与技师俱乐部”栏里发表了关于争取技术进步的斗争经验。工程师亚历山大罗夫斯基提出了关于车间主任的作用和他的争取技术进步的倡议等问题，工程师库兹湼佐夫分析了一个工厂技术研究室的工作经验……。
    在边区不少的企业里，关于金属快速切削法的采用，获得了巨大的成就。一个工厂的技术部部长舒莱美脱也夫同志就此问题在“工程师与技师俱乐部”栏里发表了意见。他讲述了在镟床上运用快速切削的方法，并作出了新的方法的理论根据。这篇文章得到了广大读者的注意。边区其他企业部门里运用快速切削的好方法，也很快地报道到编辑部来了。不久，工程师格拉却夫同志也就此问题在该栏里写了文章，报道了快速技术工作者的经验。
    在“工程师与技师俱乐部”栏内发表的文章，有着各种各样的形式和表现方法。例如用“技术经验交流”的标题，登载了各种工业技术改进过程的短讯，这些改进是在边区各企业部门里已经实现了的。例如某次登载了应用借助于电弧的金属切削法的合理化建议者的通讯后，查维金斯基机车场工程师克里伏巴洛夫同志为了响应这个短讯给报纸写了通讯，讲述在机车场里如何应用借助于电弧的金属切削法。接着，在远东铁道的机车场内以及在边区的其他企业部门内，这种方法很迅速地、有组织地被应用到金属切削中去了。
    该栏还发表了“防止金属的浸蚀法”、“机械化涂漆法”、“滤油的改进”等等每篇占四十行到六十行篇幅的通讯，向企业部门内的工人报道关于工作的改进方法，阐明这些改进使劳动生产率得以提高，成本得以降低。
    “工程师与技师俱乐部”栏也用了“企业和新建筑工程通讯”的标题，发表关于技术工作人员的通讯，同时还开辟了“我们的信箱”栏，在这一栏内发表技术人员关于各种生产工作问题的通讯。
            七、“实践诺言！”
    列宁格勒城和列宁格勒州工业部门的工作者和科学与技术部门的活动家，在一九四九年四月给斯大林同志的信中，说明他们要在科学与生产工作者的巩固的友谊的基础上，获得进步技术的不断发展。
    给斯大林同志的信，成为列宁格勒州一切工人、农民、工程师、技师、学者以及科学工作者的战斗的纲领。
    “列宁格勒真理”报向劳动者说明了列宁格勒人关于发展进步技术的倡议的政治和经济意义，报纸并为开展生产与科学工作者之间胜利实现他的重要义务的竞赛而进行了巨大的工作。
    报纸提出了各种不同的问题。编辑部关心着关于设计处、技术部、实验车间、工厂实验室工作的改进和作用的提高等等问题。同时编辑部极注意将发明家和合理化建议者的建议迅速贯彻到生产中去以迅速设计和制造最新的技术上完善的机器、器械的问题。
    “列宁格勒真理”报号召工业部门的工作者，为采用流水作业法、金属快速切削、快速冶炼以及应用有高度效能的生产设备和工具等先进技术而斗争。报纸对于苏维埃学者和科学工作者巩固与企业工作者联系，帮助生产革新者为改进技术工作和改善工厂工作的经济指标等高尚的努力，予以支持和宣传。
    基洛夫电力厂为讨论工人和科学活动家友谊合作问题的科学技术大会，是一桩有重大意义的事件。列宁格勒和莫斯科三十七个最大的高等学校和科学研究所的代表，参加了大会的工作。在大会开幕之前，学者们有计划地了解了工厂的情况，研究了这方面的现状，他们还到车间里去作了访问。著名的科学活动家——将近一百个技术科学、物理—数学科学和化学科学的博士和硕士，在大会上作了演说，讲述工厂的不久将来的远景。参加大会的一共有一千三百零七人。“列宁格勒真理”报报道了他们的工作。大会上把电力厂工作者的经验对许多其他城市的企业作了传达。
    研究所的学术会议的活动，也得到了显著的改进，工程师、工业中的斯塔哈诺夫工作者去参加他们的会议。“列宁格勒真理”报以不少篇幅报道了这种研究所的学术会议。报纸写道：“去年四月，在高等技术教育的历史上，第一次由播种机斯塔哈诺夫工作者在播种机制造工厂向林苏维也研究所的学生做了学术报告。”
    此后，斯塔哈诺夫工作者的报告变成了机械工程学系课程的一个组成部分，著名斯塔哈诺夫式机械工人伯拉脱诺夫同志、设计员特米脱里也夫同志成为向学生上课的讲师了。
    报纸关于这种报告的报道，引起了全国其他城市高等学校工作者的注意。在莫斯科、基辅、斯威特洛夫斯克、古比雪夫的高等学校也仿效列宁格勒的榜样，经常请工业和农业的革新者作报告。苏联高等教育部长赞成这种倡议，并向各高等学校介绍广泛实行这种方法。
    争取科学与生产工作者间建立创造性的友谊的运动，提高了各工程技术学术团体的积极性，这些社团的会员帮助了企业中技术改进的实施，参加了生产技术大会和工厂、工场内技术会议的工作。列宁格勒的学者并用一切方法帮助技术工作干部提高业务水平。数学博士波洛哥费也夫提出了一个有意义的倡议，根据他的提议在“技师之家”内为企业技术工作者组织了一个黑色和有色金属的光谱分析的研究班。
    报纸编辑部宣传企业中技术方面新的进步，并使生产革新者的经验成为广大群众自己的东西。在“为技术的进步而斗争中的新事物”的题目之下，报纸报道了各种材料。同时，编辑部每天要收到来自工业部门工人和科学工作者响应报纸上已发表的文章和新的建议的信件。
    编辑部还特辟这么一个栏，叫做“追随‘列宁格勒真理’报的讲话，扩大技术进步的战线。”
    报纸写道：“在这栏里，公布了寄到编辑部的许多信件。这些信件涉及各方面的问题。其中之一讲述了生产先进经验；其另一部分指出了技术的落后、保守和顽固的现象，并且尖锐地批评了一些企业领导者的工作；第三方面，向科学与生产工作者提出了新的问题。所有这些通讯，贯穿着一个思想，即：不能满足于开始的一些成就，应该用一切方法去扩大为技术的进步而斗争的战线！
    “这些信件是读者们对于最近一个时期在‘列宁格勒真理’报上发表的文章的反映，如像关于炼钢技工米希纳快速冶炼法的通讯，关于铁工克拉斯诺乌莫夫和契高莱夫卓越成就的通讯；如像关于华西列·奥金柴夫将铸型工作机械化的通讯，关于‘工厂中的光谱分析实验室’的专论；以及列别捷夫教授‘为什么对于新的、审查过的技术的掌握如此迟缓’的通讯等。“每一个企业应大大地打开大门，欢迎一切新的进步的事物。这就是发表在报上的读者来信的每一篇文章所号召的事情。他们的思想和建议，应该在科学与技术工作者、工程师与技师、工匠和斯塔哈诺夫工作者那里，得到生动的反响，现在对于列宁格勒人来说，没有一件任务比完成给斯大林同志的信中所提出的任务的诺言更重大了。”报纸以这些话结束了自己的文章。
    三天之后，报纸又重新回到它所提出的问题上来。“列宁格勒真理”报在它的“应该实践诺言”栏里提醒大家：公正的批评帮助了企业领导者去探究正确的实际的结论。有价值的建议被讨论或被采纳了。他们对于最近发表的文章的答复、他们的诺言已在“列宁格勒真理”报发表了。
    报上发表的那些文章是有力的舆论。例如基洛夫工厂熔钢车间主任索洛维也夫、车间工程师加明斯基和炼钢技工摩尔齐支在“什么东西阻碍了快速熔炼”的通讯中，对工厂的领导人提出了具体的要求。波洛哥费也夫教授写了“再谈光谱分析法”的信，希望听取列宁格勒企业和高等学校中许多领导人的意见。现在重要的是要使这些舆论不仅发挥不断的监督的作用，而且要有效地帮助企业中的领导人实行他们的义务。
    “实践诺言！”这句话要求为列宁格勒工业生产部门的技术进步而展开斗争，要求完成列宁格勒人自己写给斯大林同志的信中所提出的任务。
    为技术的进步而斗争的科学与生产工作者的创造性的友谊，蓬蓬勃勃增长着，获得了良好的成效。“列宁格勒真理”报的读者报道了在这个巨大事业中所获得的成就。
    列宁格勒基洛夫区的工厂与工场，和二十四个高等学校及许多科学研究所建立了联系。基洛夫区人一天一天地掌握了新的联合机、新机器、新器械以及各种大规模生产的新工具。他们在更广大的范围内采用了快速和流水作业法、使生产过程机械化和自动化。
    基洛夫电力厂要求科学研究所和专科学校帮助他们草拟发展工厂的远大计划。学者们热情地响应了这个请求。两个科学院通讯会员、二十六个科学博士、五十六个科学硕士及七十八个科学工作者参加发展工厂的设计工作。科学工作者提供了许多有价值的指示和意见。厂内制定了在一切生产部门里采用新技术的精确的计划。（本节完，全文未完）
