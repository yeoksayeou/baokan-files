The Tianjin Railway Bureau systematically conducts technical and professional education for its employees, cultivating a large number of talents for the country's large-scale economic construction in the past year.

The Bureau's technical and professional education for employees is mainly divided into two aspects. One aspect adopts the following three methods to organize on-the-job employees to study: First, establish various types of employee training classes, such as running locomotive, train operation, and dispatching training classes, as well as training classes for learning various advanced working methods, and rotate on-the-job employees to temporarily leave production (or not leave production) for training. Second, organize on-the-job employees to conduct general and regular professional learning, such as each unit universally organizing its technical personnel and administrative management cadres to learn the economic accounting system. Third, sign master-apprentice contracts to organize masters to teach apprentices skills. The other aspect is to transfer outstanding workers to leave production for a long time and recruit students to enter various technical schools to study. Currently established are railway schools, driver training centers, etc.

In 1952, the Tianjin Railway Bureau trained more than 15,000 employees who temporarily left production, exceeding the original plan by more than one time; among the apprentices trained through signing master-apprentice contracts, 1,008 were qualified for promotion after the skill assessment; more than 15,000 employees in various units participated in economic accounting system business learning; the three railway schools in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan cultivated a total of more than 1,100 junior technical talents, and have already participated in locomotive, civil engineering and other work; the four driver training centers have also trained more than 360 young drivers. After the employees have gone through the training, their technical level and business level have been improved. They have played a great role in reforming production and developing production, and have become a new force in the country's large-scale construction. For example, after studying, 106 out of 110 apprentices in a certain vehicle section have been promoted to third-grade workers and become backbone members in production.

The leadership of the bureau attaches great importance to the technical and professional learning of employees, which is the main reason for achieving the above results. The Bureau, sub-bureaus, and sections have all established specialized institutions, assigned professional cadres, and led employees to study. The Director of the Bureau personally grasped and led the formulation of plans to transfer employees to study advanced working methods and to organize on-the-job cadres to study the economic accounting system. In the teaching work, the personnel, education, and business departments of the Bureau jointly research and clarify the teaching objectives according to work requirements and student conditions, so that the teaching plan adapts to the needs of production and achieves the requirements of "short period, great effect".

With the start of the country's large-scale economic construction, the Bureau has now further strengthened the work of conducting technical and professional education for employees, and increased the number of students in various schools, training centers, and training classes to improve the technical and professional level of employees and adapt to the growing needs of the people's railway cause.

    天津铁路管理局有计划地对职工进行教育
    一年来为国家经济建设培养大批人材
    天津铁路管理局有计划地对职工进行技术和业务教育，为国家进行大规模经济建设培养了大批人材。
    该局向职工进行技术和业务教育，主要分两方面。一方面采用下列三种方式组织在职职工进行学习：第一种是成立不同性质的职工训练班，如开办机务、车务、调度等训练班，以及学习各种先进工作法的训练班，轮流抽调在职职工暂时脱离生产（或者不脱离生产）进行训练。第二种是组织在职职工进行一般的经常的业务学习，如各单位普遍组织本单位的技术人员和行政管理干部学习经济核算制。第三种是签订师徒合同，组织师傅教给徒工技术。另一方面是抽调优秀工人长期脱离生产并招收学生进入各种技术学校学习。现在成立的有铁路学校、司机养成所等。
    在一九五二年内，天津铁路局训练了暂时脱离生产的职工一万五千多人，超过原计划一倍以上；通过签订师徒合同训练出来的徒工，经考工合格应升职的达一千零八人；各单位职工参加经济核算制业务学习的达一万五千多人；天津、石家庄、太原三个铁路学校培养出的初级技术人材共一千一百多人，并已参加了机务、工务等工作；四个司机养成所也培养出青年司机三百六十多人。职工经过学习后，技术水平和业务水平都提高了。他们在改革生产、发展生产上都起了很大作用，并成为祖国进行大规模建设的新生力量。例如，某车辆段一百一十名徒工经过学习，已有一百零六名升为三等工，成为生产中的骨干分子。
    该局领导方面对职工技术和业务学习极为重视，是取得上述成绩的主要原因。管理局、分局、段等都设立专门机构，指定专业干部，领导职工学习。管理局局长亲自掌握和领导制订了抽调职工学习先进工作法和组织在职干部学习经济核算制的计划。在教学工作中，管理局的人事、教育、业务各部门共同研究，根据工作要求和学员条件，明确教学目的，使教学计划适应生产需要，达到“期间短、效果大”的要求。
    随着国家大规模经济建设的开始，现在该局已进一步加强了对职工进行技术和业务教育的工作，增加了各学校、养成所、训练班的学员名额，以提高职工技术业务水平，适应人民铁道事业日益发展的需要。
