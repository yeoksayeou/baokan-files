Japanese Progressive Filmmakers
Strive to Produce Progressive Films Despite Difficulties
While poisonous American films are flooding Japan, Japanese progressive filmmakers, with the active support of the Japanese people, are striving to produce excellent films despite numerous difficulties.

The Japanese progressive films that have already been completed include "No, We Want to Live," "Mother, Woman," "Hakone Fūunroku," "Yamabiko School," "Children of the Atomic Bomb Catastrophe," and "Vacuum Zone," and have been successively screened in various parts of Japan.

Recently, coal miners in Hokkaido also used funds they donated to produce a film, "A Woman Who Lives Independently," which is about to be released.

This film depicts the life of Japanese coal miners. The staff of the "Kinuta" Film Studio, who were responsible for the production, visited various mines in Hokkaido last summer and autumn, held five hundred symposiums, and listened to the talks of thousands of workers and their families in order to produce this film.

In the process of filming, the film was sabotaged and obstructed by Japanese monopoly capitalists. They prevented the film crew from shooting necessary scenes, drove the film crew out of the workers' dormitories, and instructed scabs to carry out sabotage activities.

However, the workers waged a resolute struggle against the reactionaries' despicable measures. At the Yūbari mine, the workers organized to ensure the smooth progress of the film crew's work. A large number of miners and their families actively assisted and participated in the production work. During the two months of shooting on location, 20,000 people enthusiastically participated.

    日本进步电影工作者
    不顾困难努力拍制进步影片
    正当充满毒素的美国电影充斥日本的时候，日本的进步电影工作者在日本人民积极支持下，不顾重重困难，努力拍制优秀影片。
    目前已经摄制完成的日本进步影片有：“不，我们要活下去”、“母亲、女人”、“箱根风云录”、“山彦学校”、“原子弹灾难下的孤儿”和“真空地带”等，并已陆续在日本各地放映。
    最近，北海道的煤矿工人也以自己捐助的款项摄制了一部影片——“一个独立谋生的女人”，即将放映。
    这部影片是描写日本煤矿工人生活的。负责担任拍制工作的“砧”电影制片厂的工作人员，为了拍制这部影片，在去年夏天和秋天曾遍访北海道的各矿山，举行了五百次座谈会，听取了数千名工人和他们家属的谈话。
    影片在摄制的过程中遭到日本垄断资本家的破坏与阻挠。他们阻止摄影队拍摄必要的镜头，把摄影队从工人的宿舍中赶走，并指使工贼进行破坏活动。
    但是工人们对反动派的卑鄙措施进行了坚决的斗争。在夕张矿上，工人们组织起来保证摄影队工作的顺利进行。大批的矿工和他们的家属积极协助和参加拍制工作。在拍摄外景的两个月中，有两万人热情地参加了进来。
