    The People's Government of Shou County, Anhui Province Improves Handling of People's Letters
    Editor: In the past, the People's Government of Shou County, Anhui Province, did not pay enough attention to handling letters from the people. When letters from the people were received, they were simply "approved" and passed on to the relevant departments, and the relevant departments adopted methods of procrastination and backlog. Before April of last year, the county People's Government did not know how many letters from the people it had received, nor how many had been processed. The masses were very dissatisfied.
    Under repeated questioning from the masses and repeated urging from higher authorities, the leadership of the Shou County People's Government began to pay attention to this work. Starting in April of last year, the people's letters were uniformly controlled by the secretariat of the county People's Government and then distributed to the relevant units for processing, which was relatively organized. However, because of insufficient supervision and inspection, the various units still did not pay enough attention to it. Of the forty-eight letters from the people handled in April, May, and June of last year, only eight had results. Starting in August of last year, the county People's Government decided to assign full-time personnel to handle them. This work was also arranged at the enlarged meeting of district and township cadres. In addition, the county head personally convened a meeting of the persons in charge of the relevant units and arranged for inspection. After this, there was significant improvement in the handling of people's letters. Of the thirty-four letters from the people handled by the county People's Government in July and August of last year, seventeen had results. In September of last year, the county People's Government, at a secretarial meeting of various districts and directly subordinate units, arranged for the work of handling letters from the people, and formulated a system for the registration, study, transfer, follow-up, reporting, and inspection of letters from the people. Only then did it basically arouse the attention of the relevant departments. For example, the Zhuangmu District People's Government not only completed the existing letters from the people, but also cleared the backlog of seven items before February of last year. Of the forty-eight letters from the people received in the county in September of last year, twenty-seven were completed that month. Of the eighteen in October of last year, twelve were completed that month. From April to the end of November of last year, the county received a total of 239 letters from the people. Except for 76 letters with duplicate content, the actual number was 163, and 127 have been completed.
    After attaching importance to the handling of letters from the people, there were the following gains: (1) The relationship between the People's Government and the masses was strengthened. For example, Wang Zhiguo, a Hui military family member in Yankou District, wrote a letter reflecting that Township Head Zhu Junchang did not take care of military families. After investigation by the county People's Government, it was confirmed that this was the case, and the township head was asked to make a review and the relevant military families were given the care they deserved. After the matter was dealt with, Wang Zhiguo said: "The People's Government cares about me so much, I will definitely write a letter to my son on the front line in Korea and kill more American robbers to repay the People's Government."
    (2) The counter-offensive conspiracy of illegal landlords was exposed. For example, Zhang Junran, a landlord in Wabu District, applied to change his landlord status. After several investigations by the county People's Government and the Lu'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office, it was proved that he was indeed a landlord. He also colluded with relatives and friends to "prove" that he was not a landlord, and falsely accused village cadres of "beating" his daughter-in-law, resulting in a "miscarriage." After further investigation, his conspiracy was also exposed one by one. The district and township People's Governments paid attention to strengthening control over him. (3) The illegal and undisciplined behavior of some cadres was exposed, and the cadres' policy awareness was strengthened. Of the 130 letters from the people handled by the county party committee, the county People's Supervisory Committee, and the county People's Government regarding accusations against cadres, 85 were completely correct. Through the handling of these letters, a total of 38 cadres were punished: one was sentenced to death, five were expelled, thirteen were dismissed from their posts, and the rest were given warnings and demerits; twelve of them were expelled from the party. After such handling, discipline was tightened, cadres were educated, and the prestige of the Party and the People's Government was greatly enhanced. Of course, due to insufficient supervision and inspection, individual cadres and units still do not pay enough attention to the handling of letters from the people. At the same time, from April to November of last year, there were still 36 letters from the people that had not been dealt with.
    In response to the above situation, the county has taken the following measures: (1) In addition to arranging at the county, district, and township three-level cadre anti-coercion and anti-illegal discipline conference on December 8 to clear all letters from the people before the end of December of last year, the county party committee and the county People's Government jointly instructed various districts to organize forces and combine with the central work to carry out a concentrated clean-up. (2) The county transferred cadres from relevant departments to form an inspection team to focus on checking the handling situation. (3) Through this inspection, the system for handling letters from the people was improved. It is stipulated that the relevant units directly under the county will conduct centralized research and handling once every half month; the county party committee and the county People's Government will report briefly once a month; and each district will report one matter at a time. (4) Letters from the people reporting district cadres will be handled by the county; letters from the people reporting township cadres will be handled by the district, and no further transfer downwards is allowed. (5) For general incidents, a time limit is set, and a report is submitted after handling; if the deadline is exceeded by five days, a reminder is issued; important incidents are handled and urged at any time.

### 安徽寿县人民政府改进处理人民来信工作

    安徽寿县人民政府改进处理人民来信工作
    编辑同志：安徽省寿县人民政府过去对处理人民来信工作不重视。当收到了人民来信，只“批”给有关部门就算了事；有关部门也采取了拖拉、积压的办法。去年四月份以前，县人民政府不知收到多少件人民来信，也不知处理了多少件。群众很不满意。
    在群众的一再追问下，在上级的一再督促下，寿县人民政府领导方面才开始重视这一工作。从去年四月份起，人民来信由县人民政府秘书室统一掌握，再分交有关单位处理，比较有了头绪。但因为督促检查不够，各单位仍不够重视。去年四、五、六月份中所处理的四十八件人民来信，仅八件有了结果。从去年八月份起，县人民政府又决定配备专人处理。在区、乡干部扩大会议上，也布置了这一工作。另外，县长亲自召开了有关单位的负责人会议，并布置检查。这样以后，处理人民来信工作有了较显著的改进。去年七、八月份县人民政府处理的三十四件人民来信，已有十七件有了结果。去年九月间，县人民政府在召开各区、各直属单位秘书会议上，又布置了关于处理人民来信的工作，并制订了关于人民来信的登记、研究、交办、催办、汇报、检查等制度。这才基本上引起了各有关部门的重视。如庄墓区人民政府，不仅办结了现有的人民来信，并清结了去年二月份以前积压的七件。全县去年九月份所收到的人民来信四十八件，当月办结了二十七件。去年十月份的十八件，当月办结了十二件。由去年四月到十一月底，全县共收到人民来信二百三十九件，除了七十六件内容重复的以外，实际是一百六十三件，已办结一百二十七件。
    重视处理人民来信工作以后，有了这样几点收获：（一）密切了人民政府与群众的联系。如堰口区回民军属王治国来信反映乡长祝君昌不照顾军属。经县人民政府调查属实，即让该乡长作检讨，并对有关军属作了应有的照顾。处理以后，王治国说：“人民政府这样关心我，我一定写信给在朝鲜前线的儿子，多杀美国强盗，来报答人民政府。”
    （二）揭发了不法地主的反攻阴谋。如瓦埠区地主张君然，申请改地主成份。经县人民政府和六安专署的几次调查，证明他确实是地主。他又拉拢亲友“证明”他不是地主，并诬告村干部“殴打”他儿媳以致“落胎”。继经调查，也一一揭穿了他的阴谋。并由区、乡人民政府注意对他加强管制。（三）揭发了部分干部的违法乱纪行为，加强了干部的政策观念。县委会、县人民监察委员会和县人民政府所处理的一百三十件关于控告干部的人民来信，有八十五件完全正确。通过处理这些来信，共处分了三十八个干部：一人判死刑，五人被开除，十三人撤职，余为警告、记过等；其中十二人开除党籍。这样处理后，严肃了法纪，教育了干部，也大大提高了党和人民政府的威信。当然，由于督促、检查还不够，个别干部、单位仍不重视处理人民来信工作。同时，自去年四月到十一月这一期间，还有三十六件人民来信没办结。
    针对以上情况，县里又采取了如下措施：（一）除去年十二月八日在县、区、乡三级干部反强迫命令反违法乱纪大会上布置去年十二月底以前清结所有的人民来信以外，县委会和县人民政府又联合指示各区组织力量，结合中心工作突击清理。（二）县里由有关部门抽调干部组织检查组，重点检查处理情况。（三）通过这次检查，健全处理人民来信制度。规定县直属各有关单位半月集中研究、处理一次；县委会、县人民政府一月简报一次；各区一事一报。（四）检举区干部的人民来信，由县里掌握处理，检举乡干部的人民来信，由区里掌握处理，不得再往下转。（五）一般事件，规定时间，处理后上报，逾期五天催一次；重要事件，随时催办。
