    Housing Problems in the United States and the Soviet Union

    The United Nations Secretariat recently published a preliminary report on the world social situation prepared by the Social Welfare Division of the UN Department of Social Affairs. One fact in this 615-page report is particularly noteworthy. The report states that if the housing shortage in the United States is to be eliminated, 1.5 million public housing units must be built each year for ten years. The report naturally does not mention that the US government is not as interested in eliminating the housing shortage as it is in producing armaments.

    As everyone knows, in the post-war years, the Soviet Union built 155 million square meters of new housing and 3.8 million new houses in rural areas.

    Two worlds, two paths of development.

    Complaints from US Soldiers in the Korean War

    The Pittsburgh "Sun-Telegraph" published a letter from Frank Reynolds, an American soldier in Korea, to his mother. Reynolds said in the letter: "The situation in Korea is terrible. Many American men are currently making great sacrifices because the State Department made the most absurd and stupid decision in our history. The stupidity of this decision is so obvious that it cannot be described in words... Acheson's best policy right now is to send thousands of Americans—not hundreds of Americans—to their deaths every month...."

    Clearly, these words not only represent the general cry of ordinary American soldiers, but also the beginning of their awakening.

    Arms Race Movement in the United States

    According to official US figures, the total profits of US monopoly capital in 1951 reached as high as 42.9 billion US dollars. The profits of arms manufacturers have increased particularly rapidly. For example, in the third quarter of last year, the revenue of Douglas Aircraft Company—whose military production accounts for 90 percent of its total production—almost exceeded its revenue in the same quarter of 1951 by 150 percent.

    And in the 1952-1953 fiscal year, the military expenditure borne by each person in the United States was more than 60 times that of 1939. The ever-increasing wartime taxes are suffocating American taxpayers.

    This fact aptly answers the question: who benefits from the US arms race movement and who is harmed.

    住宅问题在美国和苏联
    联合国秘书处最近将联合国社会事务部社会福利司所准备的关于世界社会情况的初步报告予以公布。这篇长达六百一十五页的报告中，有一件事实很引人注意。报告说，如果要消除美国的房荒，在十年中间每年必须建造一百五十万幢公共住宅。这个报告自然没有提到美国政府对于消除房荒是不如对于生产军火有兴趣的。
    大家知道，在战后年代中，苏联新建了一亿五千五百万平方公尺面积的住宅，此外在农村中也新建了三百八十万幢住宅。
    两个世界，两条发展路线。
    美国侵朝军士兵的怨言
    美国匹兹堡“太阳电讯报”刊载了在朝鲜的美国士兵弗兰克·雷诺兹寄给他母亲的一封信。雷诺兹在信里说：“朝鲜的情况糟透了。由于国务院作出了我国历史上最荒唐的和愚蠢的决定，因此许多美国男儿目前正在作重大的牺牲。这种决定的愚蠢极其明显，它简直无法用言语来形容……艾奇逊目前最拿手的政策是每月使成千的美国人——不是成百的美国人——去送死……。”
    显然的，这几句话不仅代表了美国普通士兵的普遍呼声，而且也是他们觉醒的开始。
    扩军备战运动在美国
    根据美国官方数字，在一九五一年，美国垄断资本的总利润已经高达四百二十九亿美元。军火制造商的利润增加得更是特别迅速。例如，在去年的第三季，道格拉斯飞机公司——军备生产占它的总生产量的百分之九十——的收入几乎超过它在一九五一年同一季的收入的百分之一百五十。
    而在一九五二—一九五三会计年度，美国每人所负担的军事开支为一九三九年的六十多倍。不断加重的战时赋税把美国纳税人压得喘不过气来。
    这一事实就很恰当地回答了一个问题：美国的扩军备战运动对谁有利，对谁有害。
