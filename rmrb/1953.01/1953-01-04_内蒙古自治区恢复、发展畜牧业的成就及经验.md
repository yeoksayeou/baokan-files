Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Achievements and Experiences in Restoring and Developing Animal Husbandry
　　Ulanhu
　　(I)
　　Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry is an important part of China's economy, especially the animal husbandry economy, and is the main production of most people in Inner Mongolia. Before the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, imperialism, the Manchu government, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the reactionary feudal rulers within the nation successively or simultaneously carried out cruel oppression and plunder of the people of Inner Mongolia, causing serious disasters to the people of Inner Mongolia. As a result, animal husbandry gradually declined, and livestock decreased sharply year by year. According to the statistics of the former Hulunbuir League, the league's sheep decreased by two-thirds and cattle decreased by three-quarters in the more than twenty years from 1919 to the liberation in 1945.
　　After liberation, in response to this situation, the Inner Mongolia Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region pointed out that all work in pastoral areas should proceed from the interests of restoring and developing animal husbandry production and improving people's lives, and stipulated the general policy of actively developing the pastoral economy, including the herdowner economy, and put forward the call for prosperity for both people and livestock, and formulated the policies of "free grazing, increasing and protecting livestock" and preserving the herdowner economy, "no division, no struggle, no class division," and implementing mutual benefit for herdowners and herders in pastoral areas. At the same time, in accordance with the demands of the people of Inner Mongolia, democratic political power at all levels was established, a united front policy was implemented that broadly united people from all walks of life, and social democratic reforms were steadily carried out, abolishing feudal privileges, eliminating bandits and special agents, and consolidating social order. This liberated the productive forces bound by the feudal system and laid a good foundation for the stable development of animal husbandry production. After this, in order to further develop animal husbandry production, in 1949, the policy of experimenting with and promoting mutual aid organizations and appropriately organizing production cooperation among herdsmen was proposed; in 1951, it was advocated to settle nomadic people and continue to formulate policies to protect pastures and prohibit wasteland reclamation in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, correcting the tendency of some areas to emphasize agriculture over animal husbandry; in terms of taxation policy, a light tax policy was adopted to allow herdsmen to recuperate; in terms of commercial trade, state-owned trading companies were universally established in pastoral areas and supply and marketing cooperatives were organized, which unprecedentedly increased the price of animal husbandry products. For example, in 1947, one jin of wool could only be exchanged for one jin of millet, but now it can be exchanged for ten jin. After strengthening political education, herdsmen have improved their political awareness and enthusiasm for production, and launched a patriotic movement to increase and protect livestock, and animal husbandry production has rapidly recovered and developed. Up to now, the number of livestock in various regions of Inner Mongolia has generally increased. According to a survey, the four leagues in the eastern region increased by 110.35% from 1948 to 1952. The Hulun Nur League, which has the fastest development, increased by 193.4% from 1947 to 1952; the Xilingol League in the pure pastoral area increased by 129% from 1948 to 1952. The total number of livestock in Inner Mongolia has doubled compared with the time of liberation.
　　With the increase in livestock, the lives of herdsmen have also been significantly improved. According to statistics, the average purchasing power of each herdsman in pastoral areas in 1951 was 433,000 yuan in RMB, which increased to 500,600 yuan in 1952. This can be seen from the actual lives of herdsmen. For example, most of the yurts in the pastoral area of the Hulun Nur League have now been replaced with new felt. At the Nadaam conference (an annual gathering of herdsmen) in the Hulun Nur League in 1950, most of the things herdsmen bought were coarse cloth, millet, and foxtail millet. Only 2,400 bags of wheat flour were sold, but in 1951, the things they bought not only greatly increased in quantity, but were mostly silk and wheat flour. According to statistics, during the six-day Nadaam conference, trading companies and cooperatives sold more than 6,000 bolts of silk and more than 4,600 bags of wheat flour, and even then, the supply could not meet the demand.
　　The improved living conditions of herdsmen can also be explained by what Zhongdui, a model worker in animal husbandry in the Hulun Nur League, said: "Before the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, I herded horses for others, living a life of not having enough to eat or wear, being beaten and scolded, and not having the basic freedom of being a human being. I never dreamed of having such a good life today. Since the Communist Party came, we poor people have turned over and can live freely. My life has improved year by year. In 1946 and 1947, my family could only eat three bags of wheat flour and seven or eight bricks of tea each year, and we could only make one new set of clothes every other year. Since 1950, it has increased to ten bags of wheat flour and thirteen bricks of tea, and everyone can make new clothes every year. My livestock only had ten horses, eighteen cattle, and twenty-four sheep at the time of liberation, but now it has increased to thirty-eight horses, forty-four cattle, and three hundred and sixty-six sheep."
　　All these facts show that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great success in animal husbandry production in the past five years. The reason for achieving these results is inseparable from the correct leadership and support of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, the selfless assistance of neighboring regions, and the active efforts of party and government cadres at all levels and all herdsmen in the region.
　　(II)
　　Restoring and developing animal husbandry is a mass production movement, which not only requires correct policies and guidelines, but also requires extremely complex organizational work and a series of specific measures. In the past five years, the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have made many efforts in animal husbandry production.
　　1. Prevention and control of livestock diseases. Since its establishment in 1947, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has paid great attention to the prevention and control of livestock diseases. From 1948 to the present, a large number of veterinary technical personnel have been trained; in 1950, epidemic prevention stations were established in various leagues one after another; in 1951, a mobile epidemic prevention team was established; in 1952, 40 epidemic prevention stations were established in various banners, counties, and cities, and Chinese and Western veterinarians were organized in some areas, and mass-based grassroots epidemic prevention organizations were universally organized in agricultural and pastoral areas where the epidemic situation was relatively serious. With such a relatively sound epidemic prevention organization and a strong epidemic prevention team, coupled with the active assistance of the broad masses, it has ensured that several major livestock diseases that have long existed in various parts of Inner Mongolia, such as rinderpest, anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, and mange, have been prevented and controlled. For example, rinderpest was once the most harmful infectious disease. According to the statistics of the four eastern leagues on rinderpest in 1942, 10,690 heads were infected and 3,383 heads died. After liberation, due to the adoption of prevention and control methods such as sealing off the epidemic area, implementing serum prevention and treatment, and carrying out universal preventive inoculation in non-epidemic areas, rinderpest has been significantly reduced. In 1950, only 19 heads died in the whole region, and in 1951, it was reduced to 4 heads. Now it has basically been eliminated. The same results have also been achieved in the prevention and control of other livestock diseases.
　　2. Eliminating wolf harm. Wolf harm in Inner Mongolia is second only to livestock infectious diseases, which seriously affects the development of animal husbandry. According to incomplete statistics, the average number of livestock eaten by wolves in the whole region in the past years was more than 50,000 heads, excluding pigs. Therefore, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has attached great importance to wolf hunting in recent years, actively mobilizing and organizing the masses to carry out regular and frequent wolf hunting campaigns, helping the masses to equip themselves with wolf hunting tools such as enclosing guns and wolf traps, and distributing pamphlets to widely introduce wolf hunting experience and methods, and formulating measures to reward wolf hunting. After the masses had a very good understanding of "killing wolves to protect livestock," the enthusiasm for wolf hunting generally increased, and many women and lamas also participated in wolf hunting. According to incomplete statistics, from 1948 to the end of June 1952, more than 40,000 wolves of all sizes were killed in Inner Mongolia, which greatly reduced wolf harm. In the wolf hunting campaign, many wolf hunting experts and wolf hunting models emerged.
　　3. Preventing wind and snow disasters. The climate in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia is severely cold in winter and spring. Herdsmen mainly graze nomadically by water and grass, and most of them do not have enough feed and insulation equipment. On the other hand, due to feudal rule, livestock were not allowed to cross the banner boundaries, so many pastures could not be fully utilized. After enduring the harsh winter, most of the livestock are weak. Once they encounter a spring blizzard, they are easily killed in large numbers. Generally, herdsmen regard spring as a difficult time to protect livestock. In recent years, the People's Government has implemented a free grazing policy, breaking down banner boundaries, uniformly adjusting pastures, advocating the grazing method of walking Aoter (that is, moving to places with good grass), and calling for grasping autumn fat, which has achieved remarkable results in preventing wind and snow disasters. For example, in the Hulun Nur League pastoral area, due to the unified adjustment of pastures and good fat grabbing in 1950, the average reproduction rate of various livestock in 1951 reached 86%. Among them, the unprecedented increase in twin lambs was about 15% of the breeding ewes. Herdsmen used to think that the death of livestock in winter and spring was inevitable, but now they firmly believe that "man can conquer nature." The People's Government has also called on herdsmen to organize mutual aid groups to resist disasters and protect livestock in winter and spring, which has solved the difficulties of shortage of labor and lack of tools, and has achieved great results.
　　4. Organize regular mating and allocate flocks to receive lambs. In the past, herdsmen in Inner Mongolia did not separate rams and ewes, so the lambing time was very long, and lambs were produced at any time in winter and spring, which was difficult to take care of and resulted in great losses. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, it immediately led herdsmen to implement the method of separating rams and ewes for grazing and regularly mating them in groups, controlling the lambing period to about 30 days around Qingming in spring. At that time, herdsmen can find spring camps that can prevent wind and snow, and concentrate their efforts to receive lambs. Since the number of livestock and the amount of labor vary from household to household, the method of allocating flocks for lamb reception under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit has been proposed, allocating the sheep of herders with more livestock to herders with surplus labor to receive lambs on their behalf, and stipulating reasonable remuneration. This method has been accepted by the vast number of herdsmen, thus greatly improving the survival rate of young animals. In the spring of 1952, herdsmen in the New Barag Right Banner of the Hulun Nur League implemented this method, and the average lamb survival rate in the banner reached 95%. The lamb survival rate in the Solon Banner of the Hulun Nur League was as high as 97.9%.
　　5. Improve feeding management. In the past, many excellent pastures in Inner Mongolia could not be used due to lack of water, while the grass volume decreased and the grass quality declined due to overgrazing in the pastures near rivers and water bubbles. Livestock in pastoral areas mainly eat snow in winter and spring, and mainly drink river water and bubble water in summer and autumn, which causes many livestock diseases. In dry years, it is even more difficult for livestock to drink water, and they often have to go to places dozens of miles away to drink water, which often leads to miscarriages and weakness. In order to strengthen feeding management, the People's Government first pays attention to the allocation, improvement and full utilization of pastures to give full play to the potential of pastures. In recent years, the results of pasture division and adjustment have saved the use of old pastures and opened up new pastures. In order to protect pastures and solve the difficulty of livestock drinking water, the People's Government has called on and helped herdsmen to dig wells, focusing on promoting waterwheels. According to incomplete statistics, in 1951 alone, 2,250 wells were dug and 2,270 old wells were repaired in the pastoral areas of the whole region.
　　In addition, attention is also paid to fire prevention. There have been no fires on the grasslands for two years. The People's Government has also called on herdsmen to harvest grass and build corrals to protect livestock during winter and spring, which is welcomed by herdsmen.
　　6. Implement a light tax policy and a trade policy that serves the vast number of herdsmen. The People's Government originally determined that the unified progressive tax rate with an exemption point and a progressive maximum amount was only 0.5% to 5%, and it was only changed to 1% to 10% this year with the development of production. However, the government's expenditure on the development of animal husbandry production far exceeded the revenue from animal husbandry tax. This not only stabilized the herdsmen's production sentiment, but also made the herdsmen feel the deep concern of the country for them and feel infinite warmth. Therefore, their patriotic enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, which can be clearly seen from the herdsmen's enthusiastic donation of airplanes and cannons in 1951. In recent years, the People's Government has also worked hard to narrow the scissors difference between industrial, agricultural and animal husbandry products, abolished the super-economic exploitation of illegal Mongolian merchants in the past, and implemented equal exchange. This made the herdsmen unprecedentedly love and cherish their livestock. Wool is no longer discarded everywhere as it used to be, and they are trying their best to make all kinds of livestock reproduce and grow rapidly.
　　7. Implement production assistance. Some herdsmen in pastoral areas lack the means of production (mainly livestock) and have difficulties in life, which also affects the development of production. In recent years, the People's Government has issued animal husbandry loans to help poor herdsmen solve the difficulties of lacking female livestock, breeding livestock, grass cutting machines, wood for wells, yurts, bean cakes, waterwheels, etc. For example, in 1950, the government lent 7,000 sheep to herdsmen who had no or lacked sheep in the Chen Barag Banner of the Hulun Nur League. After nine months, according to a survey, the average increase was 44.9%, and the living conditions of the loan households were generally improved.
　　8. Promote and implement mutual aid and cooperation movements in animal husbandry production. Primitive forms of mutual aid originally existed in animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia. In recent years, due to the rapid development of the animal husbandry economy, under the advocacy of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, mutual aid and cooperation movements have been developed among working herdsmen on a voluntary basis.
　　At present, there are three types of mutual aid groups: one is disaster prevention mutual aid groups and lambing mutual aid groups, which are organizations that exist in large numbers in pastoral areas and have a certain seasonality. The second is group grazing mutual aid groups, which are mutual aid organizations organized by herdsmen with fewer livestock to save manpower, and are quite common in pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. The third type is a higher form of mutual aid group with a certain division of labor and production plan for the whole year, which has a certain nature of production cooperative. Although this kind of mutual aid organization is not large in number at present, it is the most advanced form. For example, the Huheletai cooperative mutual aid group of herdsmen in the Chen Barag Banner of the Hulun Nur League has a total of four households, with four male and female laborers each. They have three horses, thirty-two cattle, and six sheep. In 1950, the People's Government lent them 401 sheep and two horses as their public property, and signed a cooperative production agreement. The group was divided into grazing group and sideline group, which greatly improved labor efficiency. For example, when harvesting grass in 1950, the average herdsman in the local area could only harvest 16,000 jin per person in a grass harvesting season, while the group could harvest 32,000 jin per person. By 1952, the group's livestock had developed to 1,164 heads, and they had dug two wells, built two livestock sheds, and purchased one grass cutting machine and one hay rake each, which played a certain pioneering role among the herdsmen.
　　9. Establish state-owned pastures and breeding farms. In order to develop livestock breeding enterprises in pastoral areas, absorb good grazing experience from herdsmen, gradually use scientific methods to improve breeds and improve feeding management methods, and improve livestock reproduction and conservation rates, so as to play a demonstration role for herdsmen in developing animal husbandry production, since 1949, the People's Government has successively established one state-owned pasture each in the Hulun Nur League, Jirem League, Zhaowuda League, Xilingol League, Xing'an League, and Chahar League. In 1952, it also established one state-owned pasture in the Xicha area and one livestock breeding farm in the Xilingol League. In order to improve the horses in agricultural areas and meet the needs of large-scale promotion and use of horse-drawn farm tools, one stallion farm was established in the Buteha Banner of the Hulun Nur League in 1949, and five breeding stations were established in the Arong Banner in 1950. In July 1952, a patriotic horse breeding competition was held to summarize the breeding work in the past three years, reward horse breeding models and excellent foals, etc., which greatly improved the masses' understanding of horse breed improvement and artificial insemination, changed the masses' view that artificial foals are not strong, and laid a good foundation for future horse breed improvement work.
　　10. Advocating settled nomadism is also one of the tasks currently being carried out by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In the past, settled nomadism and nomadism each had their own advantages. Settled nomadism is good for prosperous people, but because the grass production of natural pastures is limited, it is not conducive to the development and reproduction of livestock; nomadism can enable livestock to always eat good grass, which is good for livestock reproduction, but the whole family moves with the livestock all year round, which is extremely unfavorable to prosperous people. Therefore, it is advocated to settle nomadism, taking the advantages of each and making up for the shortcomings; young and strong people go out for nomadism and the old, weak, and children build their homes in settled places, with a certain division of labor. At the same time, herdsmen can also carry out mutual aid and cooperation and organize together. This will fundamentally change the face of pastoral areas and achieve the goal of prosperity for both people and livestock. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is easier to advocate nomadism for those who have already settled, while it is very difficult to advocate settlement for nomads. This requires a long period of propaganda and education and practical demonstration process to achieve, and it cannot be done too hastily.
　　(III)
　　Several main experiences:
　　When determining the policies and guidelines for various tasks in pastoral areas, we must proceed from the actual situation in pastoral areas and the urgent demands of herdsmen, and move forward steadily.
　　The policy of free grazing, increasing and protecting livestock, and no division, no struggle, and no class division in pastoral areas is determined by the Inner Mongolia Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region after careful research based on the above principles. The research results show that although the herdowner economy has feudal exploitation, it also has the nature of wage labor. After the abolition of feudal privileges, it can become a component of the new democratic economy. Therefore, the herdowner economy should be preserved, but its feudal privileges should be abolished, and a policy of mutual benefit for herdowners and herders should be implemented, and its enthusiasm for developing production should be encouraged. For herders and poor herdsmen, their wages should be appropriately increased, and the state should provide loans and assistance to improve the lives of herders and poor herdsmen through the development of production. The fact that animal husbandry has developed rapidly in recent years and the lives of the vast number of herdsmen have been improved proves that the policy of no division, no struggle, and no class division in pastoral areas and the policy of actively protecting and rewarding the development of animal husbandry are completely correct.
　　In semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, according to the actual situation in Inner Mongolia, a policy of protecting pastures, prohibiting wasteland reclamation, and developing animal husbandry in a planned and step-by-step manner has been adopted. The semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia are mostly caused by the "development" and "reclamation" policies of the Qing government, the Northern Warlords, the Japanese invaders, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In these areas, the Mongols and Han Chinese live together and agriculture and animal husbandry are intertwined for a long time, and there are contradictions in agricultural and animal husbandry production and ethnic disputes. These areas have extremely inconvenient transportation, it is difficult to transport food out, and the soil and climate are not suitable for agriculture. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to prohibit unlimited wasteland reclamation and delineate pastures in order to develop animal husbandry in a planned manner. Facts have proved that the determination of this policy has brought practical benefits to the people in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, not only overcoming the contradictions in agricultural and animal husbandry production and developing production, but also resolving the ethnic disputes left over from history.
　　Organizing mutual support between industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, animal husbandry must be developed with the help of industry and agriculture, and cooperate with the development of industry and agriculture to serve the country's industrialization. This is also one of the important experiences of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in developing animal husbandry in recent years.
　　In the past, herdsmen lacked national financial resources and assistance from agricultural areas, and the operation of animal husbandry was very limited. In recent years, the People's Government has issued a large number of animal husbandry loans. The Central People's Government issued 2 billion yuan of animal husbandry loans to Inner Mongolia in 1951. In addition, it also transferred a lot of food to pastoral areas every year, so that herdsmen had food to eat, which greatly reduced the consumption of livestock. A large number of feed such as bean cake in agricultural areas are imported into pastoral areas, and industrial production supplies pastoral areas with some production tools and daily necessities. On the other hand, pastoral areas have also transported a large number of livestock to agricultural areas in recent years, supplying the agricultural production with the necessary plowing livestock and helping the development of agriculture. At the same time, they have also supplied industrial production with a large number of industrial raw materials such as fur. The production of pastoral areas has thus been sold. The development of industry and agriculture has opened up broad avenues for the development of animal husbandry.
　　Widely absorbing and promoting the advanced experience of the masses in feeding management and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and combining technology with the masses is also the experience gained by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in developing animal husbandry in recent years.
　　The development of animal husbandry production originally required extremely complex technical work to cooperate with, but Inner Mongolia lacked such technical cadres in the past. Therefore, in addition to actively trying to train a group of cadres, working with the masses to find ways, absorbing and promoting the inherent experience of the masses, and appointing technical talents among the masses has become a very important working method. In recent years, mass-based epidemic prevention organizations have played a good role in reporting epidemics, sealing off and isolating, burying corpses, and timely treatment. Livestock feeding management has also benefited from this working method. In 1951, in order to do a good job in winter and spring, the Hulun Nur League found eight "Nutukqi" (herdsmen who can survey pastures), equipped them with five cadres, and organized a survey team to survey the winter pastures of the four banners. After 35 days of work, they surveyed the main winter pastures and made a plan to adjust pastures, solving the winter pastures for 1,142,400 livestock, which greatly reduced the situation that livestock were weak and died due to insufficient pastures in previous years.
　　Doing a good job in winter and spring is an important key to increasing and protecting livestock, and adjusting breeding livestock to implement large group separation, small group combination, flock allocation for lamb reception, and group foster care is the most effective method to improve reproduction rate and conservation rate at present. In order to do these tasks well, it is necessary to implement unified pasture allocation; organize disaster resistance mutual aid groups; implement Aoter grazing; grasp autumn fat and prepare a certain amount of foreign grass and bean cake; plan to retain spring camps; and maintain a certain ratio between breeding livestock and female livestock (such as 1:15 for horses and cattle, 1:35 for sheep, and 1:10 for camels). The best size of the herd is 250 to 300 horses, 150 to 200 cattle, 300 to 500 sheep, and 30 to 50 camels; implement flock allocation for lamb reception and organize herdsmen. Experience has proved that through these organizational tasks, herdsmen can also be guided to gradually move from individual production to cooperation and mutual aid. As long as the leadership pays attention to cultivation and assistance, it is entirely possible to move towards higher forms of mutual aid.
　　Finally, strengthening patriotic education and carrying out livestock increase and protection competition campaigns are effective methods to improve labor efficiency and increase production. For example, since last year, herdsmen in the West Soned Banner of the Xilingol League have launched a patriotic production competition campaign between Zuo and Zuo to compete for red flags, and the pure reproduction rate of livestock has rapidly increased from 0.3% to 23%. The pure reproduction rate of livestock in the Shabulaga Gacha of the Balin Right Banner of the Zhaowuda League reached 42.2% as a result of carrying out the patriotic livestock increase competition. Furthermore, using mass gatherings such as Nadaam conferences and Aobao meetings to reward model workers, compare excellent livestock, exchange production experience, and announce competition results often plays a great role in encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for production.

    内蒙古自治区恢复、发展畜牧业的成就及经验
    乌兰夫
    （一）
    内蒙古的畜牧业是我国经济、特别是畜牧经济的重要部分，是内蒙古大多数人民的主要生产。在内蒙古自治区人民政府成立以前，帝国主义、满清政府、北洋军阀、国民党反动派和民族内部的反动封建统治者，它们相继或同时对内蒙古人民进行残酷的压迫与掠夺，给内蒙古人民造成了严重的灾难，畜牧业因而日趋衰落，牲畜一年一年地急剧减少。据原呼伦贝尔盟的统计，该盟从一九一九年到一九四五年解放时，二十余年中，羊减少了三分之二，牛减少了四分之三。
    解放以后，针对这种情况，中国共产党内蒙古工作委员会与内蒙古自治区人民政府指出，在牧业区的一切工作要以有利于恢复和发展畜牧业生产，有利于改善人民生活为出发点，规定了积极发展包括牧主经济在内的牧业经济的总方针，提出了人畜两旺的号召，并制订了在牧业区“自由放牧、增畜保畜”及保存牧主经济，“不分不斗、不划阶级”，实行牧主牧工两利等政策。同时，根据内蒙古人民的要求，建立了各级民主政权，实行了广泛团结各阶层人民的统一战线的政策，并稳步地进行了社会民主改革，废除了封建特权，肃清了土匪特务，巩固了社会秩序。这样就解放了为封建制度所束缚的生产力，给畜牧业生产的稳定发展打下了良好的基础。在此以后，为了进一步发展畜牧业生产，在一九四九年提出了试行推广互助组织、适当组织牧民间的生产合作政策；一九五一年又提倡定居游牧并继续制订了在半农半牧区保护牧场禁止开荒的政策，纠正了个别地区重农轻牧的偏向；在税收政策上采取了轻税政策，使牧民得以休养生息；在商业贸易方面则在牧业区普遍建立了国营贸易公司和组织了供销合作社，使牧业产品的价格空前提高了，如一九四七年一斤羊毛仅换一斤小米，而现在已能换到十斤。再经过加强政治教育，牧民提高了政治觉悟和生产积极性，开展了爱国增畜保畜运动，畜牧业生产便迅速地恢复和发展起来。到现在，内蒙各地区牲畜数目已普遍增加，据调查，东部区四个盟从一九四八年到一九五二年增加了百分之一百一十点三五，发展最快的呼纳盟牧业区从一九四七年到一九五二年增加了百分之一百九十三点四；纯牧区的锡林郭勒盟从一九四八年到一九五二年增加了百分之一百二十九，全内蒙的牲畜总数较解放时已经增加了一倍。
    随着牲畜的增加，牧民的生活也有了显著的提高与改善，据统计，一九五一年牧业区每一个牧民的平均购买力是人民币四十三万三千元，一九五二年则增到五十万零六千元。这从牧民的实际生活中可以看出，如呼纳盟牧业区的蒙古包现在大部分都已换上了新毡子。在一九五○年呼纳盟的那达慕大会（牧民们一年一度的大集会）上，牧民们买的多数还是粗布、小米和稷子米，白面仅卖出二千四百袋，而到一九五一年，他们买的东西不但数量大大增加，而且多是绸缎和白面，据统计，在六天的那达慕大会上，贸易公司和合作社共卖出了六千多匹绸缎和四千六百多袋白面，就这样还是供不应求。
    牧民生活获得改善的情况，还可以用呼纳盟牧业劳动模范忠对的话来说明，他说：“在内蒙古自治区人民政府成立以前，我是给人家放马的，过着吃不饱穿不暖的生活，挨打受骂，没有做一个人的起码自由，当时做梦也没有想到会有今天这样的好日子。自从共产党来了以后，我们穷人都翻了身，能自由自在的过日子了，我的生活一年比一年改善了，一九四六、一九四七那两年全家每年只能吃到三袋白面，七、八块砖茶，隔年才能做一件新衣服，从一九五○年以来，就增加到十袋白面和十三块砖茶，而且每年每人都能做新衣服了。我的牲畜在解放当时只有十匹马、十八头牛、二十四只羊，现在已经增加到三十八匹马、四十四头牛、三百六十六只羊了。”
    所有这些事实，都说明内蒙古自治区五年来在畜牧业生产上已经获得了很大的成绩。所以取得这些成绩，是与共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导与扶植、邻区的无私的帮助、以及全区各级党政干部与全体牧民的积极努力分不开的。
    （二）
    恢复与发展畜牧业是一种群众性的生产运动，它不但需要有正确的政策与方针，而且需要有极其复杂的组织工作和一系列的具体措施。五年来中共中央内蒙古分局和内蒙古自治区人民政府在畜牧业生产上曾作了多方面的努力。
    一、防治牲畜病疫。内蒙古自治区人民政府自一九四七年成立以来，就极注意牲畜疫病的防治工作。从一九四八年起到现在，已训练了大批兽医技术人员；一九五○年各盟都先后建立了防疫所；一九五一年成立了机动防疫队；一九五二年各旗、县、市建立了四十个防疫站，并在部分地区将中西兽医组织起来，又在疫情比较严重的农、牧业区普遍组织了群众性基层防疫组织。有了这样一个比较健全的防疫机构与强大的防疫队伍，再加上广大群众的积极协助，就保证了以前长期存在于内蒙各地的几种主要的牲畜疫病如牛瘟、炭疽、口蹄疫、疥癣等得到防治。例如，牛瘟曾是危害最大的一种传染病，根据一九四二年东部四盟关于牛瘟的统计，患病达一万零六百九十头，死亡达三千三百八十三头，解放后由于采取了封锁疫区，施行血清防治和非疫区进行普遍预防注射的防治办法，牛瘟已显著减少，一九五○年全区仅死亡十九头、一九五一年又减到四头，现在已基本上被扑灭。在其他牲畜疫病的防治工作上，也获得同样的成绩。
    二、扑灭狼害。内蒙地区的狼害，仅次于家畜传染病害，严重地影响着畜牧业的发展。据不完全统计，全区以往每年被狼吃掉的牲畜平均都在五万头以上，其中还不包括猪。因此，内蒙古自治区人民政府几年来极重视打狼工作，积极发动与组织群众进行定期与经常性的打狼运动，帮助群众备置围枪、狼夹子等打狼工具，并印发小册子广泛介绍打狼的经验和方法，制订了奖励打狼办法。群众对“灭狼保畜”有了极好的认识后，打狼情绪普遍高涨，有很多妇女和喇嘛也都参加了打狼工作。据不完全统计，由一九四八年到一九五二年六月末，内蒙全区共打大小狼四万余只，使狼害大大减少了。在打狼运动中，出现了不少的打狼能手和打狼模范。
    三、防止风雪灾害。内蒙古牧业区冬春两季气候严寒，牧民主要逐水草而游牧，多数没有足够的饲料及保温设备。另一方面，由于封建统治，牲畜不得越过旗界，使很多草场不能充分利用。牲畜经过严冬折磨，大部身体瘦弱，一遇春季大风雪，就很容易大批死亡，一般牧民都视春季为保畜难关。几年来，人民政府实行自由放牧政策，打破旗界，统一调剂牧场，提倡走敖特尔（即游动到有好草的地方放牧）的放牧方法，号召抓好秋膘，在防止风雪灾害方面收到了显著的成绩。如呼纳盟牧业区由于统一调剂牧场和一九五○年抓膘抓得好，一九五一年各种牲畜繁殖率平均达到百分之八十六，其中绵羊下双羔的空前增多，约占繁殖母羊的百分之十五左右。牧民过去认为冬春两季死牲畜是不可避免的事，现在深信“人定胜天”了。人民政府并号召牧民组织过冬过春抗灾保畜互助小组，解决了劳动力少、工具缺乏的困难，收到了很大的成绩。
    四、组织定期交配，拨群接羔。过去内蒙地区的牧民养羊，公母向不分群，因此产羔时间拖得很长，冬春两季随时随地产羔，顾此失彼，损失很大。自治区人民政府成立后，即领导牧民实行公母分群放牧，定期合群交配的办法，把产羔期间控制在春季清明前后约三十日内，到时牧民均可找到能防风雪的春营地，集中力量进行接羔。由于各户牲畜数量与劳动力多寡不同，又提出了在自愿两利原则下进行拨群接羔办法，把牲畜多的牧户的羊拨给有剩余劳动力的牧户代为接羔，并规定合理报酬。这一办法为广大的牧民所接受，因而大大提高了幼畜成活率。一九五二年春季，呼纳盟新巴尔虎右翼旗的牧民实行这一办法，该旗羊羔成活率平均达到百分之九十五，呼纳盟索伦旗的羊羔成活率更高达百分之九十七点九。
    五、改进饲养管理。在内蒙地区过去有很多优良的草场因缺水不能利用，而在河流与水泡子附近的草场则因放牧过度，草量减少、草质下降。牧业区牲畜冬春两季主要吃雪，夏秋两季主要喝河水与泡子水，许多牲畜疾病即由此发生；每逢旱年，牲畜饮水更为困难，往往每天要到几十里以外的地方去饮水，因而常常发生流产与瘦弱现象。为了加强饲养管理，人民政府首先注意牧场的调剂、改良与充分利用，以发挥牧场的潜在力。几年来，牧场划分调剂的结果，已节省了旧牧场的使用，开辟了新牧场。为了保护草场与解决牲畜饮水困难，人民政府号召并帮助牧民打井，重点推广水车，据不完全统计，仅一九五一年全区牧业区即打井二千二百五十眼，修复旧井二千二百七十眼。
    此外还注意防火工作，草原已两年没有发生过火灾；人民政府并号召牧民打草和搭盖圈棚，以保护牲畜过冬过春，牧民对这些措施都很表示欢迎。
    六、实行轻税政策和为广大牧民服务的贸易政策。人民政府原来确定有免征点与累进最高额的统一累进税的税率仅为百分之零点五至百分之五，随着生产的发展，今年才改为百分之一到百分之十。而政府用在发展畜牧业生产上的费用却大大超过了牧业税的收入。这样，不仅安定了牧民的生产情绪，同时还使牧民感到了国家对他们的深切关怀，感到无限温暖，因而爱国情绪空前高涨，这一点从一九五一年牧民热烈捐献飞机大炮的举动中可以看得很清楚。几年来，人民政府并努力缩小了工农牧业产品的剪刀差，取缔了过去不法的旅蒙商人超经济的剥削，实行了等价交换。这样，便使牧民对自己的牲畜空前的爱护与珍贵起来，羊毛再不像过去那样随地丢弃了，对各种牲畜无不想尽办法来使之迅速繁殖生长。
    七、实行生产扶助。牧业区有一部分牧民缺乏生产资料（主要是牲畜），生活困难，同时影响生产的发展，人民政府几年来曾发放牧业贷款，帮助贫苦牧民解决缺乏母畜、种畜、打草机、井用木材、蒙古包、豆饼、水车等的困难问题。如一九五○年政府贷给了呼纳盟陈巴尔虎旗无羊或缺羊的牧民绵羊七千只，经过九个月以后，据调查平均增殖了百分之四十四点九，贷畜户的生活普遍得到了改善。
    八、提倡与推行牧业生产中的互助合作运动。内蒙地区的牧业生产中原存在有原始形式的互助。近几年来，由于牧业经济的迅速发展，在中国共产党和人民政府的提倡下，劳动牧民间已在自愿的基础上发展了互助合作运动。
    目前，互助组的类型计有三种：一种是防灾互助组与接羔互助小组，这是在牧业区大量存在的组织，带有一定的季节性。其次是合群放牧互助组，这是牲畜较少的牧民间为节省人力而组织起来的互助组织，在牧业区和半农半牧区组织的都相当普遍。第三种是常年的有一定分工和生产计划的较高形式的互助组，带有一定的生产合作社性质，此种互助组织虽然在目前还不是大量的，但却是最前进的形式。如呼纳盟陈巴尔虎旗牧民胡和勒泰合作互助组，他们一共四户，有男女劳动力各四个，自己有马三匹、牛三十二头、羊六只，一九五○年人民政府贷给他们羊四百零一只、马二匹，作为他们的公共财产，并订立合作生产公约，组内又分为放牧组和副业组，这便大大的提高了劳动效率，如一九五○年打草时，当地一般牧民在一个打草季节每人只能打一万六千斤，而该组每人能打三万二千斤。到一九五二年，该组的牲畜已发展到一千一百六十四头，又打了二眼井，建筑畜舍二栋，购买打草机、搂草机各一架，在牧民中起了一定的先驱作用。
    九、建立国营牧场与种畜场。为了在牧业区发展牲畜繁殖企业，吸收牧民好的牧养经验，逐步引用科学方法改良品种、改善饲养管理方法，提高牲畜繁殖率与保育率，在发展畜牧业生产上给牧民起示范作用，人民政府自一九四九年起先后在呼纳盟、哲里木盟、昭乌达盟、锡林郭勒盟、兴安盟、察哈尔盟建立了国营牧场各一处，一九五二年又建立了锡察区国营牧场及锡盟种畜繁殖场各一处。为了改良农业区的马匹、适应大规模的推广使用马拉农具的需要，一九四九年在呼纳盟布特哈旗设立种马场一处，一九五○年迁到阿荣旗建立了五所配种站，并于一九五二年七月召开了一次爱国增畜产驹比赛大会，总结了三年来的配种工作，奖励了配马模范及优良马驹等，大大地提高了群众对改良马种及人工受精的认识，改变了群众对人工驹不硬实的看法，给今后的马匹改良工作打下了良好的基础。
    十、提倡定居游牧，也是内蒙古自治区人民政府目前正在进行的工作之一。过去定牧与游牧各有好处，定牧对人旺好，但因天然牧场产草量有一定限制，对牲畜发展与繁殖不利；游牧能使牲畜经常吃到好草，对牲畜繁殖有好处，但全家老小一年四季随着牲畜搬家，对人旺说来极为不利。因此提倡定居游牧，取长补短；青壮年出去游牧与老弱小孩在定居地方建设家园，有所分工，同时牧民还可以进行互助合作，组织起来。这将可以达到根本改变牧业区的面貌和达到人畜两旺的目的。就目前情况说，已经定居者提倡游牧还比较容易，游牧者提倡定居则很困难，这要经过一个相当长时期的宣传教育和实际示范过程，才能达到，不能过急。
    （三）
    几条主要经验：
    在确定牧业区各项工作的政策方针时，必须从牧业区的实际情况和牧民的迫切要求出发，稳步前进。
    在牧业区自由放牧、增畜保畜及不分不斗、不划阶级的政策，是中国共产党内蒙古工作委员会与内蒙古自治区人民政府根据上述原则经过缜密研究确定下来的。研究的结果认为牧主经济虽有封建剥削，但也带有雇佣劳动的性质，在废除封建特权后，它可以成为新民主主义经济的一个组成部分。因此，应该是保存牧主经济，但取消其封建特权，实行牧主牧工两利的政策，并鼓励其发展生产的积极性。对于牧工和贫苦牧民，则适当提高其工资，国家贷款给以扶助，从发展生产中来改善牧工和贫苦牧民的生活。几年来畜牧业的迅速发展和广大牧民生活获得改善的事实，证明了在牧业区不分不斗不划阶级的政策及积极保护与奖励发展畜牧业的方针是完全正确的。
    在半农半牧区，根据内蒙地区的实际情况，则采取了保护牧场，禁止开荒，有计划有步骤的发展畜牧业的政策。内蒙地区的半农半牧区多系满清政府、北洋军阀、日寇及国民党反动派的“开拓”与
    “垦殖”政策所造成。在这些地区大部是蒙汉杂居与农牧交错，长久存在着农牧生产的矛盾和民族纠纷。这些地区交通极为不便，粮食很难外运，土质与气候又多不适宜于农业。因此，禁止无限制的开荒与划定牧场，以便有步骤的发展牧畜业，是极为必要的。事实证明：这一政策的确定，已使半农半牧区人民得到实际利益，不但克服了农牧生产中的矛盾，发展了生产，而且使历史上遗留下来的民族纠纷也得到了解决。
    组织工农牧业的相互支援，牧业必须在工业和农业的帮助下，与工业农业的发展配合，为国家的工业化服务，才能发展，这也是内蒙古自治区几年来发展畜牧业的重要经验之一。
    过去牧民缺少国家财力与农业区的援助，畜牧业的经营很有限。近几年来，人民政府曾发放大批牧业贷款，中央人民政府一九五一年发给内蒙的牧业贷款即达二十亿元，此外每年还调剂很多粮食到牧业区，使牧民有了粮食吃，大大的减少了牲畜的消耗。农业区的豆饼等饲料大批输入牧业区，工业生产供给了牧业区以若干的生产工具和生活必需品。另一方面，牧业区这几年也将大量的牲畜输送到了农业区，供应了农业所需要的耕畜，帮助了农业的发展，同时还以大量的皮毛等工业原料供应了工业生产。牧业区的出产由此得到销路。工业和农业的发展为牧业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    广泛吸取、推广群众饲养管理与畜牧兽医的先进经验，使技术与群众相结合，也是内蒙古自治区几年来发展畜牧业所获得的经验。
    发展畜牧业生产，本来需要极其复杂的技术工作来配合，但是内蒙地区过去非常缺乏这样的技术干部，因而除了积极设法训练一批干部外，与群众一起想办法，吸收推广群众中的固有经验，任用群众中的技术人材，便成了一条很重要的工作方法。几年来，群众性的防疫组织，在报告疫情、封锁隔离、掩埋尸体、及时治疗等工作上都起了很好的作用。牲畜的饲养管理，也得助于这一工作方法。一九五一年呼纳盟为了做好过冬过春工作，找了八名“努图克其”（会勘查草场的牧民），配备五名干部，组织了勘查游牧四旗过冬牧场小组，经过三十五天的工作，勘查了主要过冬牧场，并做了调剂牧场计划，解决了一百一十四万二千四百头牲畜的过冬牧场，使牲畜历年因草场不足而瘦弱死亡的情形大大减少。
    做好过冬过春工作是增畜保畜的重要关键，而调剂种畜实行大群分群、小群合群、拨群接羔、分群寄养是目前提高繁殖率与保育率的最有效办法。为了做好这些工作，就必须实行统一调剂牧场；组织抗灾互助小组；实行敖特尔放牧；抓好秋膘，并准备一定数量的洋草和豆饼；有计划的保留春营地；再就是种畜与母畜保持一定的比例（如马牛要一比十五，羊一比三十五，驼一比十），牧群最好是马二百五十至三百，牛一百五十至二百，羊三百至五百，驼三十至五十；实行拨群接羔，把牧民组织起来。经验证明，通过这些组织工作，还可以引导牧民由个体生产逐步走向合作互助，只要领导上注意培养与帮助，就完全可能走向更高的互助形式。
    最后，加强爱国主义教育，开展增畜保畜竞赛运动，是提高劳动效率增加生产的有效办法。如锡林郭勒盟西苏尼特旗牧民，自去年起，佐与佐间展开争夺红旗的爱国生产竞赛运动，牲畜的纯增殖率迅速的由百分之零点三提高到百分之二十三。昭乌达盟巴林右翼旗沙布拉嘎查因开展爱国增畜竞赛的结果，使牲畜的纯增殖率达到百分之四十二点二。再如利用那达慕大会及敖包会等群众集会，进行奖励劳模，评比优良牲畜，交流生产经验，宣布比赛结果等，对提高群众生产情绪常常起很大的鼓舞作用。
