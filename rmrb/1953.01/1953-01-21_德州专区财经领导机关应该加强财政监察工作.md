To the Editor:

Many government departments and units in Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, continue to violate financial discipline after the "Three-Anti" Movement, resulting in serious losses of state property.

Last autumn, Qihe County Middle School carried out construction. The Prefectural Education Section’s school construction plan was very cursory, and it allocated 300 million yuan without waiting for the budget to be approved or the basic construction engineering department's consent. Some people in the school also had serious ideas about extravagance, wasting resources on unnecessary equipment. For example, the school purchased so many chairs that there was an average of two chairs per teacher, staff member, and handyman, with some left over. There were also more than one washbasin and teapot per person on average. Waste in these areas amounted to over 60 million yuan. In terms of housing construction, the school arbitrarily changed the school construction plan drafted by the Prefectural Education Section, reducing the number of houses that should have been built; at the same time, waste and losses in housing construction also amounted to more than 40 million yuan. Furthermore, the unauthorized diversion of working capital by the factories under the Dezhou Industrial Company is also very serious. For example, the Zhenye Iron Factory, without asking for instructions, arbitrarily diverted 25 million yuan of working capital in late June of last year to buy 170,000 adobe bricks in preparation for construction. However, their basic construction plan only began in late August. By this time, one-third of the adobe bricks had been damaged by rain, resulting in a loss of more than 8 million yuan; as a result, the basic construction plan was not approved, leading to the accumulation of state assets. The total value of leftover materials from basic construction at the Dezhou Industrial Company's Power Company two years ago was 980 million yuan. When the Dezhou Industrial Company wanted to allocate these last year, it was discovered that the Power Company had already diverted more than 300 million yuan of materials without authorization. The Jianhua Iron Factory produces machines for its own use without going through the company.

It is worth noting that some units knowingly violate financial discipline, even repeatedly; and afterwards, they simply conduct a self-criticism and that is the end of it. The leading organs and discipline inspection departments do not pay any attention to it.

In order to better accumulate state funds and meet the large-scale national economic construction, the central government has stipulated that financial and economic departments should establish supervision agencies. I hope that the financial and economic leading organs of Dezhou Prefecture will quickly strengthen the inspection and supervision of financial discipline.

    德州专区财经领导机关应该加强财政监察工作
    编辑同志：山东德州专区不少机关单位，在“三反”运动后仍旧违反财政纪律，因而造成国家财产的严重损失。
    齐河县中学去秋进行建设，专署教育科做建校计划时就很潦草，并且没有等预算通过和基本建设工程部门的同意就拨款三亿元。该校某些人员又有着严重的铺张思想，滥置不必要的设备。如该校所置椅子，全校教职员和勤杂人员每人平均两把还有剩余。洗脸盆、茶壶等每人平均一个还多。这方面的浪费达六千万元以上。房屋建设方面，则随便变动了专署教育科拟订的建校计划，少建了应建的房屋；同时，建房中的浪费和损失也达四千余万元。再如德州实业公司所属各厂擅自挪用流动资金的情况也很严重。如振业铁工厂未经请示，在去年六月下旬擅自挪用流动资金二千五百万买土坯十七万个，准备建设。而他们的基本建设计划却在八月底才开始做，这时土坯已被雨淋坏了三分之一，损失八百余万元；结果基本建设计划未被批准，又造成了国家资财的积压。德州实业公司所属电力公司前年基本建设剩余材料总值九亿八千万元。去年当德州实业公司要调拨时，才发现电力公司已擅自挪用了三亿余元的料。建华铁工厂自己生产了机器自己用，也不通过公司。
    值得注意的是，有些单位对财政纪律是明知故犯，甚至一犯再犯；而事后只检讨一下就了事，领导机关和纪律检查部门也不加过问。
    为了更好地积累国家资金，迎接国家大规模的经济建设，中央已规定财经部门设立监察机构，我希望德州专区财经领导机关迅速加强财政纪律的检查、监察工作。　范凌
