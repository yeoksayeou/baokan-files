    When We Read Letters of慰问
    Political Worker, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, Jiang Hong
    In the days of fighting on the Korean front, we often receive letters of慰问 from the people of the motherland. These letters, like thousands of threads, connect the hearts of the people of the motherland with us across mountains and rivers.
    One early winter afternoon, after an intense battle that lasted for more than four hours, there was a temporary lull. Comrades from the transportation team braved the enemy's artillery blockade and brought a batch of letters of慰问 that had just arrived from the motherland. After reading one, a young soldier smiled and asked the squad leader, "Squad leader, let me read this letter to everyone! It's from a little brother in the motherland, it's great." The squad leader agreed, and everyone applauded. He began to read:
    "…Volunteer Army uncles! The teacher said that you are fighting very bravely, wiping out many American devils, and also captured the devils' carbines. I hope the uncles will leave me one! We now do morning exercises every day and participate in sports. When we grow up, we will also be soldiers like the uncles who defend the motherland….”
    Before the letter was finished, the enemy began to attack again. The soldiers calmly lay in their fortifications, their hearts pounding: "For the motherland, for the children." An infinite force encouraged the soldiers, and time and again they drove back the attacking enemy.
    A few days later, we received another batch of letters of慰问 from the motherland. I opened one, which was written by a comrade named Hui Shuqin from the Zhongnan Electric Factory. First, she said in the letter: "Our factory has added new factory buildings and employee residences. This December, I can bring my mother to live in the factory. My family was originally a poor peasant family who suffered all kinds of bullying from landlords. My mother is an honest and loving working woman. My mother hates landlords very much. She loves me, loves the motherland, and also loves the Volunteer Army comrades..." I felt happy from the bottom of my heart after reading this. Then she wrote: "In the production reform, our factory will increase production and save 160 billion yuan by the end of 1952. When the factory's Increase Production and Savings Committee announced this figure to everyone, it also calculated that 160 billion yuan could buy 106 airplanes, or 200 cannons. If it were bought as grain, it could supply tens of thousands of people for a year. If we use our brains more to increase production and save a little more, we can give our Volunteer Army more good weapons and eat more dumplings and meat. Once this account was calculated, everyone's enthusiasm came, and everyone applauded enthusiastically..." What enthusiastic support this is for us!
    Reading the letter, I thought: It is not just one child, one mother, who loves our Volunteer Army, but countless children and mothers; it is not just one factory, one village, one school that supports us, but all the factories, villages, and schools that are all over the motherland. How warm our hearts are, how strong our strength is!
    I read a letter from the remote southwest of the motherland, from a minority brother. This was written by a young man named Yang Kexiong. He said: "I am a Miao youth from the Guizhou Plateau in the southwest of the motherland, and I am now studying at the Southwest Nationalities Institute. The school takes care of us in every possible way. Just take the matter of wearing clothes, for example. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, we are given the clothes for the current season in advance. Now we have put on new winter cotton clothes. Our study life is full of joy and happiness. There are more than 700 people in our five institutes, from 49 ethnic groups. In this revolutionary school, this warm family, we help each other, unite, love each other, cooperate, like brothers and sisters. The estrangement and hatred that the reactionary rulers created among our ethnic groups have gone forever. This is a great achievement of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. At the same time, we also know that our happy life today is inseparable from the Volunteer Army's hard work and heroic fighting. Recently, I received a sum of royalties, and I will use it as the fee for writing to you to express my heartfelt love to you." Reading the letter, I shared the happiness of this Miao youth. Brothers and sisters of countless ethnic groups in the motherland, live more happily! We will never allow American imperialism to invade you again!
    There are even letters that come from even farther away! This was written by Comrade Zhang Guolong, an old brother of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang. He told us a story:
    "…The People's Liberation Army comrades on the border are all working with the spirit of resisting America and aiding Korea. During the spring plowing and planting, they worked with the lights on at night. Some comrades made plans to intensify their labor to support the Volunteer Army. They drew a map, marked the distance from Xinjiang to Korea, and put a 'car' on it; when labor achieved results, the 'car' would move forward little by little until the plan was completed and the 'car' was driven to Korea." I seemed to see the heroic People's Liberation Army brothers working selflessly on the vast Xinjiang grasslands today, and saw their "cars" moving on the map. The heroic brothers' love and support for us not only gives us great strength, but also gives us lofty honor.

### 当我们读着慰问信的时候

    当我们读着慰问信的时候
    志愿军某部政治工作人员　江洪
    在朝鲜前线的战斗的日子里，我们时常收到祖国人民寄来的慰问信。这些信，像千万根线，通过千山万水，把祖国人民的心和我们联结在一起。
    初冬的一个下午，激烈的战斗进行了四个多钟头，暂时静下来了。运输组的同志们通过敌人的炮火封锁线，捎来了刚从祖国寄来的一批慰问信。一个青年战士看了一封，笑着向班长要求说：“班长，让我给大家念念这封信吧！是祖国小弟弟写来的，太好了。”班长允许了，大家也鼓掌欢迎。他念起来了：
    “……志愿军叔叔们！听老师说，你们打的很勇敢，消灭了好多美国鬼子，还缴了鬼子们的卡宾枪。希望叔叔们要给我留下一支呀！我们现在天天早操，参加运动，将来长大了，也要做一个像叔叔们一样的保卫祖国的战士………”
    信还没有念完，敌人又开始进攻了。战士们从容地爬在自己的工事里，心激烈地跳动着：“为了祖国，为了孩子们。”一股无穷的力量鼓舞着战士们，一次再一次地把进攻的敌人打下去了。
    过了几天，我们又收到了来自祖国的一批慰问信。我打开了一封，是中南电工厂里一位名叫惠书琴的同志写来的。首先她在信中说：“我们厂里又添盖了新的厂房和职工住宅，今年十二月我就可以把我的妈妈接到厂里来住了。我的家原来是受尽地主欺凌的贫农家庭，我的妈妈是一个诚朴而又慈爱的劳动妇女，妈妈非常恨地主，她爱我，爱祖国，也爱志愿军同志……”我看了从心眼底下冒出了高兴劲。接着她又写道：“生产改革中，我们厂中要在一九五二年底增产节约一千六百亿元。厂中增产节约委员会在向大家宣布这个数字时还算了一下，一千六百亿元能买一百零六架飞机，或二百门大炮，要买成粮食，可供给十几万人吃一年。我们多动点脑筋增产，多节约一点，就可以让我们的志愿军有更多的好武器，多吃饺子、肉。这账一算，大家的劲头都来了，一齐热烈地鼓掌……”这是对我们多么热情的支援呵！
    读着信，我想着：热爱我们志愿军的，不只是一个小孩、一个母亲，而是无数的小孩和母亲；支援我们的，不只是一个工厂、一个乡村、一个学校，而是遍布祖国各个角落的所有工厂、乡村、学校。我们的心是多么温暖，我们的力量是多么强大！
    我读到了一封来自祖国遥远的西南，来自一位少数民族兄弟的信。这是一位名叫杨科雄的青年写的。他说：“我是祖国西南贵州高原的一个苗族青年，现在西南民族学院学习。学校里对我们的照顾无微不至。就拿穿衣服这件事来说吧，春、夏、秋、冬四季，每季都提早发给了我们本季的衣服，现在我们已穿上了冬季的新棉衣。我们的学习生活充满了愉快和幸福。我们五院七百多人，来自四十九个民族。在这个革命的学校、温暖的大家庭里，我们互助、团结、友爱、合作，像兄弟姐妹一样。反动统治者给我们各民族制造的隔阂、仇视，已经一去不复返了。这是毛主席民族政策伟大的成就。同时，我们也知道，我们今天的幸福生活是和志愿军的艰苦奋斗、英勇战斗分不开的。最近我得到一笔稿费，我将它作为向你们写信的费用，以表达我对你们的衷心热爱。”读着信，我分享了这位苗族青年的幸福。祖国各民族无数万兄弟姊妹们，你们更幸福地生活吧！我们决不允许美帝国主义再来侵犯你们！
    还有来得更远的信哩！这是进驻新疆的解放军老大哥张国隆同志写来的，他告诉了我们一个故事：
    “……边疆的解放军同志，都是以抗美援朝精神进行工作。在春耕抢种时，夜晚点着灯劳动。有的同志订出了计划，要加紧劳动来支援志愿军。他们画了一张地图，把由新疆到朝鲜的路程标出来，上面放一‘汽车’；劳动有了成绩，‘汽车’就一点点往前挪，直到完成计划，把‘汽车’开到朝鲜去。”我仿佛看到了这些英雄解放军老大哥们今天在辽阔的新疆草原上忘我地劳动的情景，看到了他们的“汽车”在地图上移动。英雄兄弟们对我们的热爱和支援，不只是给我们巨大的力量，而且是给我们的崇高的荣誉。
