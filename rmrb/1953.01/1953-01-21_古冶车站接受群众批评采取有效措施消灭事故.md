To the Editor: On August 12th of last year, your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column published my letter criticizing the Guye Station of the Tianjin Railway Administration for insufficient safety education for employees and for the fact that some operating procedures and safety regulations were merely formalities, leading to a series of injuries and deaths. The Tianjin Railway Administration and Guye Station have taken this issue very seriously. Guye Station launched a "Safety Production Campaign Month" in August. First, the station's administrative leaders held a mobilization meeting, where they made a self-criticism to the employees regarding their bureaucratic style and their erroneous thinking of neglecting safety in production. They also mobilized the masses to examine the causes of past accidents. Finally, after mass discussion, they re-established safety operation rules and technical operation rules. This not only corrected the past erroneous thinking of the station's administrative leaders, who "only cared about tasks and neglected safety," but also ensured that the safety system was truly grasped by the masses. As a result, from August to October of last year, the station did not have a single accident. Although an accident occurred in early November in which a worker's foot was crushed, the administrative leaders took it very seriously and conducted a major safety and sanitation inspection in mid-November.
    In general, Guye Station has seriously accepted the criticism from the Party newspaper and has taken effective measures to improve its work, thus basically eliminating accidents, which has made the criticism have a very good effect.

    古冶车站接受群众批评采取有效措施消灭事故
    编辑同志：去年八月十二日你报“读者来信”栏发表了我对天津铁路管理局古冶车站对职工安全教育不够，一些操作规程及安全制度流于形式，以致连续发生伤亡事故的批评信。天津铁路管理局和古冶车站对这个问题都很重视。古冶车站在八月份就展开了“安全生产运动月”。首先，该站行政领导干部召开了动员大会，向职工检讨了官僚主义作风和忽视安全生产的错误思想，并动员群众检查了过去发生事故的原因。最后，又经过群众讨论，重新制订了安全作业制度和技术作业制度。这样，不但纠正了过去该站行政领导干部“只顾任务、忽视安全”的错误思想，也使安全制度真正被群众所掌握。因此，去年八月至十月，该站未发生一次事故。十一月初旬，该站虽然发生了一件工人脚被轧伤的事故，但行政领导干部十分重视，在十一月中旬又进行了安全卫生大检查的工作。
    总的说来，古冶车站已认真接受了党报的批评，采取了改进工作的有效措施，因而基本上消灭了事故，使批评有了很好的效果。
