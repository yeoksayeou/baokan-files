    The East China Construction Engineering Department and the Industrial Department exhibit considerable and serious bureaucraticism in the allocation of cadres to support national infrastructure construction. In September of last year, the East China Military and Administrative Committee received instructions from the Central People's Government to allocate a group of civil engineering and construction personnel from East China to support the infrastructure construction of a certain unit under the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The East China Military and Administrative Committee decided to allocate six technical personnel from the Construction Engineering Department. However, up to now, after a full one hundred days, the Construction Engineering Department has not allocated even one person. The Personnel Department of the Military and Administrative Committee has sent multiple official documents and made numerous phone calls urging the allocation, but the Construction Engineering Department has consistently adopted a delaying tactic, unwilling to provide personnel. The responsible cadres of the Construction Engineering Department responded to the Personnel Department of the Military and Administrative Committee's request for cadres by saying, "Our technical personnel cannot be transferred under any circumstances." Their reason is: the department has a large workload. The Construction Engineering Department bears significant infrastructure construction tasks, which is a fact. Precisely because of this, the leading organs previously transferred three hundred technical personnel from various regions to supplement the construction engineering departments. However, when the more important areas of national construction needed to transfer some technical personnel from the Construction Engineering Department, certain responsible cadres of the Construction Engineering Department, proceeding from the partial interests of their own unit, were unwilling to obey the overall interests of the state.
    The East China Industrial Department has also adopted the same attitude as the Construction Engineering Department in the issue of allocating cadres to support national infrastructure construction. In August of last year, the East China Military and Administrative Committee decided to allocate ten electrical technology personnel from the Industrial Department to support the infrastructure construction of the Central Fuel Industry Department. To this end, the East China Military and Administrative Committee also sent multiple official documents, made numerous phone calls, and sent people to the Industrial Department to urge the allocation, but up to now, the Industrial Department has not allocated a single person. The initial response from certain responsible cadres of the Industrial Department was: "Our organization is constantly expanding, and we do not have enough technical personnel"; later they said: "When our department goes to the bureaus below to allocate personnel, the bureaus are unwilling to allocate"; on November 3rd of last year, they sent an official document to the Personnel Department of the Military and Administrative Committee, which stated: "We will make unified adjustments when we adjust the organization to avoid internal emotional turmoil." Now, the organization of the Industrial Department has been adjusted, but not only have the ten electrical technology personnel to be transferred not been allocated, but on the contrary, they have repeatedly requested sixty technical personnel from higher-level organizations; and according to investigations, the Industrial Department itself also has thirty-two technical personnel who are placed in non-technical positions such as clerical, personnel, and labor unions, where their skills are not being used appropriately.

### 华东建筑工程部和工业部  在抽调干部中存在本位主义

    华东建筑工程部和工业部
    在抽调干部中存在本位主义
    华东建筑工程部和工业部，在抽调干部支援全国基本建设上存在着相当严重的本位主义。去年九月间，华东军政委员会接到中央人民政府的指示，要从华东抽调一批土木建筑工程人员支援中央第二机械工业部所属某单位的基本建设。华东军政委员会曾决定从建筑工程部抽调六个技术人员。可是直到现在，经过整整一百多天的时间，建筑工程部连一个人也没有抽调出来。军政委员会人事部曾给建筑工程部去过多次公文催调，也去过很多次电话催调，但建筑工程部还是采取拖延态度，迟迟不肯拿出人来。建筑工程部的负责干部对军政委员会人事部抽调干部的回答是：“我们的技术人员无论如何也不能调出去”。他们的理由是：这个部门的任务大。建筑工程部负有重大的基本建设任务，这是事实。正因为如此，领导机关过去曾从各地抽调了三百个技术人员，补充到建筑工程部门去。可是当国家建设更重要的地方需要从建筑工程部抽调几个技术人员时，建筑工程部的某些负责干部，却从本单位的局部利益出发，不肯服从国家整体的利益。
    华东工业部在抽调干部支援全国基本建设的问题上，也采取了与建筑工程部同样的态度。去年八月间，华东军政委员会曾决定从工业部抽调十个电业技术人员支援中央燃料工业部的基本建设。为此，华东军政委员会也向该部去过多次公文、打过多次电话，并且派人去工业部催促，可是直到现在，工业部也没有抽调出一个人来。工业部某些负责干部最初的回答是：“我们的机构不断扩大，技术人员不够”；以后又说：“我们部里到下面局里去调，局里不肯调”；到去年十一月三日，他们又送给了军政委员会人事部一个公文，这个公文里说：“待我们调整机构时统一调动，以免内部情绪混乱”。现在，工业部的机构已经调整完毕，但是要调的十个电业技术人员不但一个也没有抽调出来，相反的，他们却三番五次地向上级组织要六十个技术人员；而据调查，工业部本身还有三十二个学非所用的技术人员被安置在文书、人事、工会等非技术岗位上，没有合理地使用。    （新华社）
