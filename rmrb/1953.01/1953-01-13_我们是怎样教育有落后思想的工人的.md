    How We Educate Workers with Backward Thinking
    Zhang Zongquan, Secretary of the Party Branch of Workshop 1, Factory 724 of the Chinese Communist Party
    Our factory attaches great importance to learning from the advanced propaganda and education work experience of the Party Branch of Workshop 2 of Factory 321 in Shenyang. In order to learn this experience well, we first held an enlarged meeting of the branch committee to examine the reasons why advanced production experience could not be widely promoted in our workshop in the past. The reasons are threefold: First, the promotion of advanced production experience was limited to general appeals, and no serious technical summary was made; second, the specific ideological situation of the workers was not grasped, and the ideological problems in their learning of advanced production experience were not solved; third, some cadres in the workshop had conservative ideas, believing that the products of the repair workshop were scattered and complex, and it was not suitable to promote advanced experience. In view of the above situation, the branch organized cadres above the level of workshop foreman to study the working methods of Factory 321 in promoting advanced production experience. During the study, they criticized the erroneous view of some foremen that the experience of Factory 321 was not suitable for implementation in the repair workshop. At the same time, they specifically analyzed the ideological situation of all the workers in the workshop and discussed the correct attitude towards backward thinking among the workers. Then, the branch mobilized all the workers to summarize the advanced production experience and advanced thinking of the advanced figures recognized by everyone—lathe operator Tang Yuren and fitter Chang Baokun—and Tang Yuren and others made systematic reports to everyone. At this time, most of the workers used these advanced ideas to compare themselves and examine their own erroneous ideas, determined to learn advanced experience and create more wealth for the country. In this way, the thinking of most workers has made significant progress.
    The branch committee further studied the issue of improving the workers who were still in a backward state. The branch believed that it was first necessary to select typical figures who "resolutely" did not learn advanced experience for patient education, so that they would consciously learn advanced experience and advanced thinking. Then, they would use them to drive other workers who were still in a backward state, and promote workers in the intermediate state to move forward. Therefore, the branch chose Sun Shunji, who had more prominent ideological problems at the time, as the object of education.
    Sun Shunji, 36 years old, has 15 years of work experience. He has been working in Factory 724 since liberation. For the past four years, his performance has been consistently poor, so everyone calls him "old backward" and "everyone's headache." Sun Shunji originally worked in Workshop 1. When the factory department uniformly adjusted workers, the workshop cadres, in order to "push him out to save trouble," sent him out. Sun Shunji was transferred to Workshop 6, but his work was still not active, and no one wanted him, so he was transferred to Workshop 12. Later, he was transferred to the cleaning brigade. After the cleaning brigade was cancelled, he returned to Workshop 1. Because Sun Shunji did not work well, the workers in his group raised this opinion: "Please transfer Sun Shunji away, otherwise, he will affect the production of the whole group."
    Before educating Sun Shunji, the branch learned about his ideological and work situation from the workshop where Sun Shunji had worked and the workers who knew him well.
    The branch secretary talked with Sun Shunji a total of five times.
    The first conversation was after the report meeting on advanced figures and advanced ideas. The branch secretary asked Sun Shunji what he had learned from advanced experience and advanced ideas. Sun Shunji replied: "What advanced experience, advanced ideas, have nothing to do with me!" "I am old and backward, and I cannot learn advanced ideas. I am considered backward to the end." The branch secretary asked him why he didn't want to make progress? He said: His father is old and no one takes care of him, and no one washes or makes clothes for him (he is not married yet); he hasn't had a raise in four years and is still a fourth-grade worker. He also said: "Even if these difficulties are solved, it is not guaranteed that I can make progress, and it is not guaranteed that I can learn advanced experience." The branch secretary criticized him: "It's been more than four years since liberation, everyone else is making progress, why aren't you making progress?" Sun Shunji said: "I am just like this. If you don't want me, just fire me." At this time, the branch secretary patiently explained to him the difference between the new society and the old society, but he was unwilling to listen.
    This conversation was a failure. The reason for the failure was that he could not be enlightened about his class consciousness from Sun Shunji's personal experience. Based on this situation, the branch decided to start by understanding his background and the actual difficulties of his current family life.
    After learning from various sources, the branch learned that Sun Shunji and his father were both old workers. Sun Shunji became an apprentice in a factory in Shanghai at the age of 16, and was often beaten and scolded by the capitalists. After three years as an apprentice, his father lost his job, and the whole family depended on the four silver dollars he earned each month for a living. However, Sun Shunji was also often unemployed, making the family life even more difficult. After the Japanese occupied Shanghai, Sun Shunji escaped from the factory and lived a life of begging. Later, he went to the Northeast. Although Sun Shunji had also been a technician in the old society, he had never saved any money and could not even marry a wife or bring his begging father over. Later, he wanted to save money and accumulate two sacks of sorghum rice to exchange for two taels of gold (at that time, it was during the rule of the Chiang bandits, and there was a severe food shortage, and grain was very expensive) to pick up his father. Before he had accumulated enough grain, the Northeast was liberated. After liberation, workers' wages increased, and Sun Shunji brought his father over. But he has always been dissatisfied with the fact that the sorghum rice was not exchanged for gold, and attributed this matter and the past suffering of the whole family to "bad luck." At the same time, because the capitalists of the joint private factory said they would give him "high wages" to lure him to be a technician, he was not active in his work and wanted to go out to be a technician. For example, Sun Shunji originally didn't smoke, but he made a pipe and smoked while working. When others asked him why he did this? He said, "Can't I even smoke?" When drinking water, he specifically poured a bowl of boiling water and drank it slowly, wasting time. Sun Shunji wanted to use these methods to achieve the goal of jumping factories. At the same time, he also had some opinions on the fact that the leaders did not solve his family difficulties for him.
    After learning about Sun Shunji's specific situation, the branch decided to have the trade union solve his actual difficulties first. For example: mobilizing female workers to help him with some housework. Before he got married, he was lent mutual aid funds to buy wedding supplies. When the wedding ceremony was held, waist drum teams and propagandists were organized to congratulate him. Sun Shunji felt that everyone was "too kind" to him, and the Party was "too concerned" about him. At the same time, the branch secretary patiently conducted ideological education for him. In each conversation, he guided him to recall the tragic life of his family in the past and compare it with the specific facts that his family was reunited and his life was greatly improved in front of him, to realize that the status of the working class had changed and to establish the concept of being the master of the country. He also explained that the suffering of workers in the old society was caused by the oppression and exploitation of the reactionaries and capitalists; in the new society, the lives of workers have improved because our country is led by the working class, and it is not because of "good luck." He also used the fact that the factory's production has developed and the lives of workers have improved in the past few years to make him realize that active labor now is for the country and also for himself. He also guided him to realize that in the old society, workers developed the labor attitude of "goofing off" because they were subjected to extremely heavy exploitation and oppression. Today, they should learn the advanced ideas of advanced figures, learn advanced experience, and develop production. Only in this way can they be worthy of the glorious title of the working class.
    After each individual conversation, as long as he showed even a little progress, the branch immediately organized propagandists to publicize it widely in the workshop. For example, when Sun Shunji was listening to the first article of the standard of a Communist Party member, he walked from the back row to the front row and listened attentively (in the past, Sun Shunji always squatted aside and was unwilling to listen to classes and meetings). The branch immediately praised this. For example, when Sun Shunji voluntarily formulated a personal "progress plan," the propagandist used the blackboard newspaper to publicize it. When he had difficulties in learning advanced experience, the branch appointed someone to provide specific help. When his products doubled compared to the past, the branch praised him again.
    After such a series of vivid and concrete ideological and political education work, Sun Shunji felt that "the Communist Party's education of me is too patient and the help is too thoughtful." Therefore, he took the initiative to find the branch secretary and asked to review his past mistakes at the workshop mass meeting. The branch expressed its welcome to him doing so and helped him prepare the content of the report. The branch also considered that it was not appropriate to use the name "review" meeting and that it should use the name "Sun Shunji's Report Meeting on Learning Advanced Ideas." In this way, it can further educate him and also educate all the workers.
    At the meeting, Sun Shunji sincerely reviewed his past backward actions and thoughts, reported on his transformation process, and announced his specific plan for learning advanced ideas and advanced production experience. After the meeting, the branch arranged for party members and propagandists to publicize to the masses, mobilized workers to compare themselves with Sun Shunji's thoughts, improve their consciousness, learn from advanced figures, and better promote advanced experience.
    In this way, all the workers in the workshop, especially the workers who were still in a backward state, compared themselves with Sun Shunji's thoughts. Jia Mingyue said: "Sun Shunji was more backward than me, but now he has run to the front, I can't fall behind, I must study advanced ideas well." Sui Kejian said: "Sun Shunji's progress woke me up. As long as a person is determined to make progress and learn from advanced figures, they can definitely make rapid progress." Moreover, the workers' understanding of the Party is more profound, and the Party's prestige has been further enhanced. Hou Yongxing said: "The Communist Party is too great. It can educate Sun Shunji well, proving that it can educate all backward people well; all backward people can make progress under the leadership of the Communist Party."
    Under the influence of Sun Shunji's progress, the atmosphere of the workshop demanding progress, demanding to learn advanced experience, and learning from advanced figures is getting higher and higher every day. The Party branch organized technical performances and specifically conducted education on new technologies to meet the urgent demand of workers to improve their skills after improving their ideological awareness. In carrying out technical performances and publicizing advanced experience, the branch continued to pay attention to helping typical figures such as Sun Shunji to improve, in order to drive all workers to continue to move forward. Under the cultivation of the Party branch, Sun Shunji won the "Second Class Award for Learning Advanced Experience."
    After such meticulous political and ideological work, the advanced experience to be promoted in the first workshop was fully realized. Among the 143 workers directly involved in production, 51 fitters found tricks; 26 lathe operators implemented high-speed cutting methods; 37 lathe operators implemented multi-tool and multi-blade cutting methods; 10 lathe operators implemented single-tool and multi-blade cutting methods; 28 workers implemented the advanced experience of multi-milling and multi-planing (some of the workers also learned several advanced experience).
    From the entire process of educating Sun Shunji's transformation, the workshop cadres, especially the branch secretary, the chairman of the trade union, and the secretary of the Youth League branch, deeply felt that only by using such patient and meticulous democratic and persuasive education methods can we truly guide the workers who are still in a backward state to move forward. The simple and rude methods of the past were wrong.

    我们是怎样教育有落后思想的工人的
    中共七二四工厂一车间支部书记　张宗权
    我们厂十分重视学习沈阳三二一厂第二车间党支部的先进的宣传教育工作经验。为了很好地学习这一经验，我们首先召开了支委扩大会议，检查了本车间过去不能普遍推广先进生产经验的原因。其原因有三：一、推广先进生产经验，只限于一般号召，没有认真地从技术上加以总结；二、没有掌握职工的具体思想情况，解决他们在学习先进生产经验中的思想问题；三、车间某些干部有保守思想，认为修理车间产品零星复杂，不宜推广先进经验。根据上述情况，支部组织车间工长以上干部学习三二一工厂推广先进生产经验的工作方法，在学习中，批判了某些工长认为三二一厂经验不适合在修理车间推行的错误看法。同时具体分析了全车间职工的思想情况，讨论了对待职工中落后思想的正确的态度。接着，支部发动全体职工总结了大家所公认的先进人物——车工唐玉仁、钳工常宝坤的先进生产经验和先进思想，并由唐玉仁等向大家作了系统的报告。这时，大部职工用这些先进思想对照自己，检查自己的错误思想，决心学习先进经验，为国家创造更多的财富。这样大多数职工思想有了显著的进步。
    支部委员会进一步研究了提高还处在落后状态的职工的问题。支部认为必须首先选择“坚决”不学习先进经验的典型人物，进行耐心的教育，使其自觉地学习先进经验先进思想。然后再用他们去带动其他尚处在落后状态的职工，并推动处在中间状态的职工前进。于是支部选择了当时思想问题较突出的孙顺吉为教育对象。
    孙顺吉，三十六岁，已有十五年工龄。解放后就在七二四工厂做工。四年来，一贯表现不好，因此大家叫他为“老落后”“万人烦”。孙顺吉原在一车间做工，厂部统一调整工人时，车间干部为了
    “推出去省心”，就把他送出去了。孙顺吉调到六车间，工作仍不积极，大家不要他，又被调到十二车间。以后又调到清扫大队。在清扫大队取消后，又回到了一车间。因为孙顺吉不好好工作，和他一个小组的工人提出了这样的意见：“请把孙顺吉调走，否则，他会影响全组生产。”
    支部在对孙顺吉教育之前，曾在孙顺吉工作过的车间和熟悉他的职工中了解了他的思想工作情况。
    支部书记和孙顺吉共谈过五次话。
    第一次谈话是在开了先进人物先进思想报告会以后。支部书记问孙顺吉对先进经验先进思想有什么体会。孙顺吉回答说：“什么先进经验，先进思想，与我无关！”“我是老落后了，不能学习先进思想。我算落后到底了。”支部书记追问他为什么不想进步呢？他说：父亲年老没人照顾，衣服没人洗也没人做（他还没结婚）；四年没长工资，还是四级工。并说：“即使解决了这些困难，也不保准能进步，也不保准能学习先进经验。”支部书记就批评他：“解放四年多，别人都进步，你为什么不进步？”孙顺吉说：“我就这样。不要我，开除好了。”这时支部书记就耐心地向他说新社会和旧社会不一样的道理，但他不愿意听。
    这次谈话是失败的。失败的原因是还不能从孙顺吉的切身经历去启发他的阶级觉悟。支部根据这种情况，决定先从了解他的出身和他现在的家庭生活的实际困难着手。
    经过多方面了解，支部知道了孙顺吉和他的父亲都是老工人。孙顺吉十六岁就在上海一家工厂中当学徒，经常受资本家的打骂。三年满徒以后，父亲失业，全家就靠他每月赚的四块大洋生活。可是孙顺吉也经常失业，以致家庭生活更加困难。日寇占领上海后，孙顺吉从工厂中逃出来，过着乞讨的生活。以后到了东北。虽然孙顺吉在旧社会里也当过技师，可是没有剩过钱，连个老婆也娶不上，乞讨的父亲也接不来。后来想省吃俭用积存两麻袋高粱米，换二两金子（当时正是蒋匪统治时期，粮荒严重，粮食很贵）去接父亲。在他的粮食还没有积蓄够数时，东北解放了。解放后，工人增加了工资，孙顺吉接来了父亲。但他一直对高粱米没换成金子的事感到不满，并把这件事和全家过去受尽的痛苦，都归结为“命不好”。同时因为私营联合工厂资本家说给他“高额工资”拉他去当技师，所以他工作不积极，想出去当技师。比如孙顺吉本来不会抽烟，他却做个旱烟袋，在做活时抽烟。别人问他为什么这样作？他说“还能不让抽烟吗？”在喝水时，他专门倒碗滚开的水，慢慢喝，磨时间。孙顺吉想用这些办法达到跳厂的目的。同时他对领导干部不给他解决家庭困难也有些意见。
    支部了解到孙顺吉这些具体情况后，便确定由工会先解决他的实际困难。例如：动员女工帮助他做些家务。在他结婚前，借给他互助基金办结婚用品。举行结婚典礼时，又组织腰鼓队、宣传员去贺喜。孙顺吉感到大家对他“太亲了”，党对他“太关心了”。同时，支部书记耐心地向他进行了思想教育。在每次谈话中，都引导他回忆过去全家悲惨的生活，和眼前家庭团圆、生活大大改善的具体事实作比较，认识工人阶级的地位已经变化，树立起国家主人翁的观念。又说明工人在旧社会受到痛苦，是反动派和资本家的压迫和剥削造成的；在新社会工人生活改善了，是因为咱们的国家是工人阶级领导的，都不是什么“命”的好坏。又用这几年工厂生产发展了，工人生活改善了的事实，使他认识了现在积极劳动是为了国家，也是为了自己。又引导他认识：在旧社会里，工人因为受极重的剥削和压迫，养成了“磨洋工”的劳动态度。在今天应该学习先进人物的先进思想，学习先进经验，发展生产，只有这样，才能对得起工人阶级的光荣称号。
    在每一次个别谈话后，只要看他有一点点进步表现，支部便马上组织宣传员在车间里广泛宣传。例如孙顺吉在听讲共产党员标准的第一条时，从后排走到前排，听得入神（过去上课、开会，孙顺吉总是蹲在一边不愿听）。支部对此即加以表扬。又如孙顺吉自动制订个人“进步计划”时，宣传员便利用黑板报予以宣传。在他学习先进经验有困难时，支部便指定专人具体帮助。当他的产品比过去提高了一倍时，支部又进行表扬。
    经过这样的一系列的生动的具体的思想政治教育工作后，使孙顺吉感到“共产党对我的教育太耐心了，帮助太周到了”。因此他就主动地找支部书记，要求在车间群众大会上检讨自己过去的错误。支部表示欢迎他这样做，帮助他准备报告内容。支部并考虑到用“检讨”大会的名义不合适，应当用“孙顺吉学习先进思想报告会”的名义。这样，既可进一步教育他本人，又可教育全体职工。
    孙顺吉在大会上诚恳地检讨了过去的落后行动和思想，报告了他的转变过程，并宣布了自己学习先进思想、先进生产经验的具体计划。会后，支部布置党员、宣传员向群众宣传，发动职工用孙顺吉思想对照自己，提高觉悟，向先进人物看齐，更好地推广先进经验。
    这样，全车间的工人，特别是尚处在落后状态的工人，都用孙顺吉思想对照了自己。贾明月说：“孙顺吉原比我落后，现在人家跑到前面去了，我不能落后，一定要好好学习先进思想。”隋克俭说：“孙顺吉这一进步，把我惊醒了，一个人只要决心进步，学习先进人物，一定可以很快进步。”而且工人对党的认识更深刻了，党的威信更加提高了。侯永兴说：“共产党太伟大了，能把孙顺吉教育好，证明它能把所有落后的人教育好；所有落后的人都能在共产党领导下进步。”
    在孙顺吉进步的影响下，车间要求进步、要求学习先进经验、学习先进人物的空气一天天高涨。党支部组织了技术表演，具体地进行了新技术的教育，满足工人在提高了思想觉悟之后，迫切要求提高技术的要求。在进行技术表演，宣传先进经验中，支部继续注意帮助提高孙顺吉等典型人物，以带动全体职工继续前进。在党支部的培养下，孙顺吉得到了“学习先进经验二等奖”。
    经过这样细致的政治思想工作，准备在第一车间推广的先进经验，就全部实现了。直接生产的一百四十三个工人中，有五十一个钳工找到了窍门；二十六个车工实行了高速切削法；三十七个车工实行了多刀多刃切削法；十个车工实行了单刀多刃切削法；二十八个工人实行了多铣多刨的先进经验（其中有的工人还学会了几种先进经验）。
    从教育孙顺吉的转变的全部过程中，车间干部，特别是支部书记、工会主席、青年团支部书记等人，都深切地感到，只有使用这样耐心细致的民主说服的教育方法，才能真正引导尚处在落后状态中的工人前进。过去那种简单的粗暴的方法是不对的。
