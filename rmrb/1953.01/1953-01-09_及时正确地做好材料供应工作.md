    Do a Good Job in Timely and Correct Material Supply
    Central Railway Ministry Materials Supply Bureau
    In the past few years, the material supply of the railway system has mainly relied on a large amount of reserves to meet the needs of material-using departments. However, due to many shortcomings in the work of the material supply department, on the one hand, supply and demand are often out of sync, resulting in work stoppages and waiting for materials; on the other hand, due to the great blindness of material preparation, it does not fully meet the needs of material-using units, resulting in a large number of materials being stagnant, accumulating a large amount of funds, and causing difficulties in capital turnover, which seriously affects the supply work. The construction of new railway lines and the replenishment of existing lines in 1953 have not only increased in quantity but also improved in quality requirements. If the old management methods are still used, it will not be able to adapt to the needs of the development of the objective situation. Therefore, the material supply work must not only ensure timely supply but also not allow the accumulation of large amounts of funds again. It is necessary to complete the maximum amount of tasks with the minimum amount of funds under the principle of economic accounting.
    The following are some of the experiences we have initially explored from studying the advanced work methods of the Soviet Union and the work process of the past three years:
    First: Ideologically, it must be clear that ensuring timely supply is the primary task of the materials department. Especially in large-scale economic construction, railway basic construction projects are the foundation for the future development of railways. In the material supply work, the material supply work of basic construction projects should be raised to a primary position, listed as the main object of supply, and planning and coordination should be strengthened in actual work to ensure the required quantity and quality.
    Second: In terms of working methods: 1. It is necessary to prepare material preparation plans based on the annual tasks of each material-using department and the material application forms submitted by them, and sign agreements with each competent department before applying to the state or ordering from the competent industrial departments, to enhance the correctness of material preparation and prevent new stagnant materials. 2. Adopt a contract system in the supply method. That is, according to the agreement, sign material supply contracts with each material-using unit on a quarterly and monthly basis. The material-using unit guarantees to receive and use the materials in full and does not accumulate the funds of the material department, and the material department guarantees to supply them on time without delaying the work needs. If some materials are difficult to produce at home and abroad, alternative materials can be agreed upon in advance to ensure the needs of the project. At the same time, a stagnant and old material exchange meeting can be organized when signing the contract to exchange what each unit has for what it needs, which is not only conducive to the capital turnover of each unit but also can be used to solve the difficulties that the supply department temporarily cannot raise certain materials. 3. Implement a sending system to ensure timely supply. According to past experience, material-using units temporarily request transportation without a plan, and it is difficult to get vehicles first; and the material plant (warehouse) cannot predict the types and dates of material withdrawal, and material distribution and delivery will inevitably be delayed. The most advanced method in the Soviet Union is to implement a sending system, in which the supply department proposes a vehicle demand plan according to the contract and transports the materials to the factory (warehouse) or construction site of each material-using department on time. In particular, direct trains should be organized as much as possible, and the materials should be shipped directly from the producing factory without going through the factory (warehouse), which is both timely and saves costs.
    Timely supply, for the material department, is only a part of the work completed, and the other part must have correct supply to truly implement the spirit of economic accounting; otherwise, although timely supply is achieved, a large amount of materials are accumulated in the warehouse, or the management is not strengthened, resulting in increased expenses, and the quality of the supplied materials is inappropriate, all of which will directly affect the cost. Therefore, first, the application forms of the material-using units should be thoroughly reviewed, the unreasonable parts should be reduced, and the excessively high-quality material standards should be reasonably lowered. Second, the material consumption standards should be regularly studied at the material-using places, the progress of the project (or production) and the quality of the supplied materials should be understood, and the real situation of the on-site needs should be discerned in a timely manner. If a department will complete the task ahead of schedule due to competition or improved operation methods, the remaining unsupplied materials should be prepared as soon as possible; if the plan is changed midway during production or construction, some materials can be prepared less or delayed. In this way, the overall material consumption dynamics can be controlled proactively and with emphasis, and funds can be used correctly and flexibly. If it is found that the quality of the supplied materials is too high, the quality should be lowered in the future. If the consumption quota is higher than the actual consumption, the consumption quota should be lowered. Third, the material technology should be further improved, alternative materials should be studied, and their use range should be expanded, and their service life should be extended, and stagnant and old materials should be utilized as much as possible. Under the premise of ensuring project quality, strict economy should be practiced to reduce project costs. Fourth, strictly implement the plan. After the contract is signed, it must not be increased or decreased casually. In this way, the supply department's orders will not be accumulated, the supply cost can be reduced, and the material-using units are also promoted to have precise calculations in advance.
    In addition, in order to supply in a timely and correct manner, a production reform centered on economic accounting must also be carried out within the material supply organizations at all levels to gradually realize quota management and achieve the purpose of reducing supply costs and accelerating capital turnover.

    及时正确地做好材料供应工作
    中央铁道部材料供应局
    过去几年来铁路系统的材料供应，主要是依靠了大量的储备来满足用料部门的需要的。但由于材料供应部门的工作有许多缺点，一方面经常产生供需脱节、停工待料的现象；另一方面，因为备料的盲目性很大，不完全适合用料单位需要而造成大批材料呆滞，积压了大量资金，以致资金周转困难，严重地影响了供应工作。一九五三年新修线路的建设与旧有线路的补给，不惟在量的方面增大了，而且质的要求也提高了。如果仍沿用旧有经营管理方法，就不能适应客观形势发展的需要。因此，材料供应工作，既要保证及时供应，也不允许再积压大量资金，要在经济核算的原则下面，以最低限度的资金来完成最高限度的任务。
    下面是我们从学习苏联先进工作方法与过去三年的工作过程中初步摸索到的一些经验：
    第一：在思想上必须明确，保证及时供应是材料部门的首要任务。特别是在大规模经济建设中，铁路基本建设工程是今后铁路发展的基础，在材料供应工作上就要把基本建设工程的材料供应工作提高到首要地位，列为供应的主要对象，并在实际的工作中加强计划与联系以保证其需要的数量与质量。
    第二：在工作方法上：一、必须根据各用料部门的全年任务及其所提出的用料申请书编制备料计划，并与各主管部门签订协议再分别向国家申请或向主管工业部门订购，以增强备料的正确性，防止新的呆料。二、在供应方式上采取合同制度。即根据协议按季分月与各用料单位签订用料供应合同，用料单位保证如数领用，不积压材料部门的资金，材料部门保证如期供应不误工需。如果某些材料国内外生产都感困难时，事先即可商定代用材料以保证工程的需要，同时在签订合同时又可组织呆旧物资交流会，互换有无，既有利于各单位的资金周转，又可借以解决供应部门暂时对某些材料不能筹措的困难。三、实行发送制度，保证供应及时。根据过去经验，用料单位不按计划临时提运，要车就首先遭到困难；而材料厂（库）对提料的种类与日期又无法预计，配料发料势必稽延时日。苏联最先进的办法就是实行发送制度，由供应部门根据合同提出要车计划，按时运到各用料部门厂（库）或工地，特别应该尽量组织直发列车，由所生产的工厂直接发运，不再经过厂（库），既能及时又节省费用。
    供应及时在材料部门来说，只是完成了工作的一部分，另一部分还要有正确的供应，才算是真正贯彻了经济核算的精神；否则虽然做到及时供应，但仓库积压了大量材料，或者本身不加强管理以致增大开支，以及供应材料质量不适当等，这都会直接影响成本。因此，第一，应切实审核用料单位的申请书，削减其不合理的部分，并合理地降低过高品质的材料标准。第二，经常到用料处所研究材料消费标准，了解工程（或生产）进度及供料的品质，及时洞悉现场需要的真实情况。如某一部门由于竞赛或改进操作方法将提前完成任务，则其余未供应材料应及早准备；如果生产或工程中途改变计划，则某些材料可以少备或缓备，这样才能主动的、有重点的控制全面用料动态，正确的、机动的运用资金。如发现供料质量过高，以后即应降低质量。消耗定额高于实际消耗，应降低消耗定额。第三，在材料技术上再提高一步，研究代用材料，并扩大其使用范围，延长其使用寿命，尽力利用呆旧材料。在保证工程质量下面，厉行节约以降低工程费用。第四，严格执行计划。签订合同以后不得随便增加或减少。这样供应部门订货不致积压，供应成本得以降低，也促进用料单位在事前有精密计算。
    另外，为了及时而正确的供应，在各级材料供应机构内部还必须进行一次以经济核算为中心的生产改革，逐步实现定额管理，达到降低供应成本、加速资金周转的目的。
