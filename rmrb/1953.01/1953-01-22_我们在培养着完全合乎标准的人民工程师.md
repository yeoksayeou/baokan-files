    We Are Cultivating People's Engineers Who Fully Meet Standards
    Li Jiabao, Assistant Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology

    The task of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology is to cultivate people's engineers who fully meet standards. This task requires us to adopt correct teaching methods. Our teaching work has two characteristics: First, it implements the spirit of combining theory and practice; second, it has clear objectives and a high degree of planning. Our course internships, graduation thesis design, and the work of the department and teaching and research sections fully reflect these two characteristics.

    Now, let me first talk about the curriculum. Our curriculum is formulated according to the Soviet teaching plan. Each specialized group has a different teaching plan. The teaching plan specifies in detail the courses that the students in that group must study, the study time for each course, the total number of hours, and the number of hours per week; it also stipulates the allocation of lecture hours, experiment hours, and classroom discussion hours for each course. The courses are entirely based on the knowledge that engineers in that specialty should possess, and they are all compulsory courses. This is completely different from the old-style universities where courses were set up based on individuals, or where only the names of courses were listed without considering the actual content of the courses, and the teaching objectives were unclear. Taking myself as an example, I used to study specialized courses such as railway engineering, automotive engineering, steam turbines, hydraulic machinery, manufacturing methods, and tool science in university. In addition, I also studied general professional courses such as kinematics, mechanical design, thermodynamics, and factory practice. However, there was no organic connection between these professional courses. For example, there was very little connection between railway engineering, automotive engineering, and steam turbines, and these three courses were completely unrelated to manufacturing methods and tool science. Moreover, manufacturing methods and tool science lacked the necessary prerequisite courses, so after graduation, I seemed to understand everything but actually understood nothing. Today, the courses in the mechanical manufacturing group's teaching plan in our mechanical engineering department are completely different. In five years, a total of thirty-three courses are studied, including professional courses such as metal science, tolerances and technical measurement, metal cutting and cutting tools, machine tools, mechanical manufacturing technology, fixture design (or auxiliary device design), forging and pressing, welding, mechanical factory design principles, safety and fire prevention technology, enterprise organization, planning, and economics. Each course has a specific purpose and role, and none can be missing. For example, the course on tolerances and technical measurement tells students how to calculate and select tolerance fits, how to inspect tolerance fits, and what measuring tools and precision measuring instruments are generally used. Therefore, it is an indispensable basic knowledge, but there was no such course in old-style universities. Similarly, metal science, metal cutting, and cutting tools are also basic courses. The former briefly introduces knowledge of metal smelting, metallography, metal cold and hot working, and welding, enabling students to have a preliminary understanding of metal smelting, etc., and laying the foundation for their first "introductory internship" and factory internship on campus. The same is true for cutting principles and tools, which did not exist in old-style universities in the past. Another example is safety and fire prevention technology, which is also an important course; it tells students how to pay attention to safety devices when designing machine factory buildings. However, universities in capitalist countries do not value this course because capitalists only consider how to increase the labor intensity of workers in order to obtain greater profits. The fixture design course tells students how to design and use fixtures or auxiliary devices to mechanize and automate the entire production process, in order to reduce auxiliary device time and worker labor time. This course is only fully valued in socialist or new democratic countries.

    The above examples illustrate that each course stipulated in the teaching plan of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology (and the same goes for other departments) has a clear purpose and cannot be missing; and each course is closely linked before and after, as well as between courses. Therefore, all courses are compulsory and cannot be elective. Teaching according to such a teaching plan ensures that graduates can become qualified engineers in factories and lead production well. For example, when students from the 1951 class went to factories for internships, many students made many valuable rationalization proposals to the factory leadership. This proves that our learning meets actual needs.

    Let's talk about internships. In our teaching plan, internships are an indispensable part, and they have the same importance as theoretical courses. Our teaching plan clearly stipulates that in five years, students must undergo four internships, totaling twenty-three weeks, with a ratio to class weeks of about one to six. The first internship is an "introductory internship," which takes place at the end of the second academic year and lasts for three weeks. Its main purpose is to give students a general understanding of the various workshops in the factory. The second (at the end of the third academic year) and third internships are both production internships, each lasting six weeks. Their main purpose is to enable students to study certain important issues in production in depth and practice the design of production processes; at the same time, they conduct critical research on the organization of production, the mechanization and automation of production processes. The last internship is a pre-graduation thesis internship (during this internship, students must collect materials and conduct research on their graduation thesis topic). After these four internships, students are very familiar with all parts of the factory and already know how to apply theory to practice.

    How is the graduation thesis design carried out? Students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering complete their theoretical courses at the end of the first semester of the fifth year; at this time, the teachers guiding the graduation thesis design assign graduation thesis topics according to the students' situation. The students then go to the designated factory to conduct internships based on their thesis topics. During this period, students conduct thorough research on issues related to the graduation thesis topic and collect materials. After the students return to school, they conduct graduation thesis design under the guidance of teachers, for a period of fourteen weeks (approximately equivalent to one semester). Students can discuss problems in the thesis design with their supervisors at certain times each week. Graduation thesis design can be said to be a summary of the entire learning process. Therefore, in the design process, students generally have to apply all the courses they have learned in the past. Graduation thesis design not only requires the designer to master the theoretical knowledge they have learned, but also to fully understand the specific problems existing in the factory. This is a test for the author, that is, whether they can truly be an engineer in a mechanical factory. For example, the graduation thesis topics of students in the mechanical manufacturing group generally involve the design of various manufacturing workshops. The thesis topics of the students who graduated in the summer of 1952 included: the design of broach manufacturing workshops and various types of tool workshops, etc. In this design, the author is required to design the shape, working drawings, etc. of the broach or tool according to the annual production volume, and explain which machine tools are selected for manufacturing, the manufacturing process to be followed, and the appropriate fixtures to be selected to make the work as mechanized and automated as possible. In addition, it is also necessary to design the arrangement of machines in the manufacturing workshop, the size of the factory building, the manufacturing cost, the personnel required, and safety issues, as well as the organization system of the workshop.

    Let's take the 1952 graduation thesis design as an example. The design content includes the following items: 1. Production task. 2. Technical operation and design section: (1) Working drawings of parts and blanks; (2) Several simplified diagrams of the adjustment work of the parts processing operation process; (3) Fixture drawings: Several processing fixture drawings; Several inspection fixture drawings; (4) Working drawings of cutting tools and inspection measuring tools; (5) Operating procedures, analysis of parts processing and equipment selection. 3. Calculation section (various calculations proposed in the thesis instructions). 4. Equipment plan and workshop layout, with several cross-sectional drawings of the workshop. 5. Production organization. 6. Economic section. 7. Safety technology: Design... safety devices for the process. 8. Design description (attached design original data). In short, the requirement of the graduation thesis design is: all design problems related to the workshop should be considered. In this way, the students who are doing the graduation thesis must apply the mechanical manufacturing technology, factory design principles, fixture design, safety and fire prevention technology, tool design, enterprise organization economics, and planning courses they have learned to practice; at the same time, they must be able to criticize the existing shortcomings in the factory and consider how to simplify the manufacturing process so that workers feel the most convenient during labor and the productivity is maximized. After completing the graduation thesis, it must first pass a preliminary examination before the graduation examination (or called "preliminary defense"). When holding the "preliminary defense," the supervisor, the director of the teaching and research section, the head of the department, and related teachers all participate to jointly check the student's thesis design. After the "preliminary defense" is over, if the teachers think that the student's graduation thesis preparation work has been completed and they can participate in the graduation examination (or called "graduation defense"), the student's graduation thesis will be sent to the factory where the student interned and the engineers and chief engineers in the factory are responsible for giving evaluations (at the same time, the supervisor also gives evaluations), and then the examination committee is organized to conduct the graduation examination. The examination committee is generally composed of off-campus experts, on-campus teachers, the president of the school, and the heads of the department and the teaching and research section. The chairman of the examination committee is held by off-campus personnel. During the examination, the author of the graduation thesis first reports the main content of the thesis, and then the examination committee raises questions (the content of the questions is relatively broad and not limited to the scope of the thesis). After such a rigorous examination, the examination committee evaluates the score and decides whether to allow graduation.

    Such a rigorous graduation thesis design and strict examination ensure that the graduating students can completely combine theory and practice and become engineers suitable for modern factories. For example, when we held the graduation examination last summer, we invited the chief engineers of Harbin Machinery Tenth Factory, Fourteenth Factory, and Electrical Engineering Fourth Factory to participate. They were all very satisfied with the graduating students, because the theses of several graduating students were useful and could be adopted. For example, the cemented carbide tool designed by student Zhou Guodong is not only practical but also reduces product costs; and some factories are considering partially adopting the graduation thesis designs of students Xu Fuge, Li Qingchun, and others.

    Finally, I will talk about the role of the department and the teaching and research section. The teaching and research section is the most basic organization of teaching work. It is not divided according to administrative systems or specialized groups, but according to one or several courses of the same nature. The teaching and research section is responsible for the entire teaching problem related to this one or several courses. The head of the department leads the teaching work of the entire department through the teaching and research section, and checks the teaching work of teachers and the homework of students. The teaching and research section regularly reports to the head of the department on the teaching situation of teachers, teaching methods, and the progress of scientific research; and ensures the completion of the teaching calendar and teaching plan for the relevant courses; in addition, the teaching and research section leads teachers to carry out scientific research work and does a good job of student scientific research groups. The head of the department is responsible for ensuring the completion of the teaching plan of the entire department.

    In addition to checking the teaching work of teachers and understanding the learning, homework, and course design of students, the head of the department is also responsible for conducting life and political and ideological education for students. This work is carried out through the class monitor. The class monitor regularly reports to the head of the department on the learning and life of the students in the class. If the head of the department finds that a student is not working hard or is absent without reason, they will talk to the student separately to understand the reasons for the above phenomenon and educate the other party; if it is found that a student is not keeping up with their studies, they will try to help them.

    According to our experience, only with the strong leadership of the department and the teaching and research section can we ensure the successful completion of teaching work.

    We are cultivating the people's engineers of New China in this way, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    我们在培养着完全合乎标准的人民工程师
    哈尔滨工业大学机械系助理系主任　李家宝
    哈尔滨工业大学机械系的任务，是培养完全合乎标准的人民工程师。这个任务要求我们采取正确的方法进行教学。我们的教学工作有两个特点：第一，它贯彻了理论和实践相结合的精神；第二，它有着明确的目的性和高度的计划性。我们的课程实习、毕业论文设计以及系和教研室的工作，就充分地体现了这两个特点。
    现在，我先来谈谈课程问题。我们的课程是按照苏联的教学计划制定的。每个专业组都有不同的教学计划。在教学计划中详尽地规定了该组同学必须学习的课程、每一课程的学习时间，总共时数和每周时数等；也规定了每门课程的讲课时数、实验时数和课堂讨论的时数分配。课程完全是按着该专业工程师应具有的知识而制定的，都是必修课程，这和旧型大学中因人设课，或只顾虚排课程名目而不考虑课程的实际内容、教学目的不明确的情况是完全不同的。拿我自己来说，我从前在大学里曾学过火车工程、汽车工程、汽轮机、水力机械、制造方法、工具学等专门课，另外还学过机动学、机械设计、热工和工厂实习等一般性专业课程，而这些专业课程之间是没有有机的联系的。如火车工程、汽车工程和汽轮机之间的关联就很少，而这三门课和制造方法、工具学则完全没有关系；制造方法、工具学又缺乏必要的先修课程，因此毕业后什么都似懂非懂，实际上是什么都不懂。今天，我们机械系机械制造组教学计划中的课程则完全不同，五年中共学三十三门课程，其中专业课有金属工学、公差和技术测量、金属切削及切削刀具、机床、机械制造工学、夹具设计（或称辅助装置设计）、锻工和压工、焊工、机械工厂设计原理、保安和防火技术、企业组织、计划和经济等。每一门课都有其一定的目的和作用，决不能缺少。如公差及技术测量这一门课程，它告诉同学怎样计算及选择公差配合，怎样检验公差配合，一般应用些什么量具及精密测量仪器。因此，它是不可缺少的基础知识，但在旧型大学里就没有这门课。同样，金属工学、金属切削及刀具，也是基础的课程，前者简要地介绍了金属冶炼、金相、金属冷热加工及焊接等等的知识，能够使同学对金属冶炼等具有初步的认识，同时给他们的第一次“认识实习”和校内工厂实习奠定基础。切削原理及刀具，同样如此，在过去的旧型大学里是没有的。再如保安及防火技术，也是一门重要的课程；它告诉同学们在设计机器厂房时应该怎样注意保安装置。但在资本主义国家的大学里是不会重视这门课的，因为资本家只考虑如何加强工人的劳动强度，以便获得更大的利润。夹具设计一课，告诉同学们怎样设计，并利用夹具或辅助装置使整个生产过程达到机械化、自动化，以便减少辅助装置时间和工人的劳动时间。这一课程同样只有在社会主义或新民主主义国家才会得到充分的重视。
    以上几个例子，说明了哈尔滨工业大学机械系
    （其他系也一样）的教学计划中所规定的每一门课程都有着明确的目的性，不能缺少；而且每一门课的前后，以及各课程间也都有着紧密的联系。因此，各门课程都是必修，不能选修。按照这样的教学计划进行教学，毕业同学到了工厂中都能成为合格的工程师，很好地领导生产。如一九五一年度同学到工厂中去实习时，有很多同学曾向工厂领导方面提了不少宝贵的合理化建议。这就证明我们的学习是符合实际需要的。
    再来谈谈实习吧。在我们的教学计划中，实习是不可缺少的一部分，它和理论课程有着同等的重要性。我们的教学计划明确规定，在五年中，同学必须经过四次实习，总共需时二十三周，和上课周数之比约为一比六。第一次实习为“认识实习”，在第二学年完了时进行，一共需时三周，其主要目的在于使同学对工厂各车间具有一般的认识。第二次（在第三学年完了时进行）和第三次实习都是生产实习，时间都是六周。其主要目的在于使同学深入地研究生产中的某些重要问题，并练习生产过程的设计；同时对生产的组织、生产过程的机械化和自动化进行批评性的研究。最后一次实习为毕业论文前实习（在这次实习中，同学们必须就自己的毕业论文题搜集材料，进行研究）。每次实习都有详尽的实习提纲，并有实习指导教师（由学校指定），同时厂里还派工程师担任指导教师。经过这四次实习，同学们对工厂的各部分都已经很熟悉了，已经知道如何把理论运用到实际中去。
    毕业论文设计是怎样进行的呢？机械系同学到第五年级上学期末即结束了理论课程的学习；这时指导毕业论文设计的教师就根据同学的情况分别指定毕业论文题目。而同学们则依据论文题目到指定的工厂里去进行实习。在这一段时间中，同学们对和毕业论文题有关的问题做充分的研究，并搜集材料。同学们回学校后即在教师的指导下，专门进行毕业论文设计，时间为十四周（约相当于一个学期的时间）。同学们每周可以在一定的时间内和指导教师共同讨论论文设计中的问题。毕业论文设计，可以说是整个学习过程的总结，因此在进行设计中，同学们一般都要应用到过去所学过的各门课程。毕业论文设计不仅要求设计者掌握自己所学到的理论知识，还必须完全了解工厂中存在的具体问题。这对于作者说来是一个考验，即能否真正担当一个机械工厂的工程师的考验。例如机械制造组同学的毕业论文题所涉及的，一般都是各种不同制造车间的设计问题。一九五二年暑期毕业同学的论文题有：拉刀制造车间以及各种类型车刀车间的设计等。在这次设计中，要求作者必须根据每年度的生产量，设计出拉刀或车刀的形状、工作图等，并说明选用那些机床来进行制造，设计应经过的制造程序，选用适当夹具以使工作尽量机械化、自动化等。此外，还要设计该制造车间中机器的排列、厂房的大小、制造成本、需要的人员和保安问题以及该车间的组织系统等。
    还是拿一九五二年度毕业论文设计来作一个例子，设计内容包括下列几项：一、生产任务。二、技术操作和设计部分：（一）零件和毛坯的工作图；
    （二）零件加工操作过程的调整工作简图若干张；
    （三）夹具图：加工夹具图若干张；检验夹具图若干张；（四）切削刀具和检验量具的工作图若干张；（五）操作规程，零件加工和设备选择的分析。三、计算部分（有关论文指示中所提出的各项计算）。四、设备计划和车间布置，附车间横断面图若干张。五、生产组织。六、经济部分。七、保安技术：设计……工序的保安装置。八、设计说明
    （附设计的原始资料）。总之，毕业论文设计的要求就是：凡有关车间的一切设计问题都应该加以考虑。这样，作毕业论文的同学就必须把他所学过的机械制造工学、工厂设计原理、夹具设计、保安和防火技术、刀具设计、企业组织经济及计划等课程运用到实际中去；同时，必须能够批评工厂中现有的缺点，并考虑怎样简化制造过程，使工人劳动时感到最方便，而生产率又最大。做完毕业论文以后，必须先经过一次毕业考试前的预备考试（或称“预备答辩”）。举行“预备答辩”时，指导教师、教研室主任、系主任和有关教师都参加，共同检查同学的论文设计。“预备答辩”结束后，如果教师认为同学的毕业论文准备工作已经完成，可以让他参加毕业考试（或称“毕业答辩”）时，就将同学的毕业论文送到该同学实习的工厂里去，请该厂内的工程师、总工程师负责给予评价（同时指导教师也给予评价），然后组织考试委员会进行毕业考试。考试委员会一般由校外专家、校内有关教师、校长以及系和教研室的负责人等共同组成。考试委员会的主席则由校外人士担任。考试时先由毕业论文的作者报告论文的主要内容，随后由考试委员会提出问题（问题的内容是比较广泛的，不仅仅限于论文范围之内）。经过如此严格的考试后，才由考试委员会评定分数，决定是否准予毕业。
    这样严密的毕业论文设计和严格的考试，保证了毕业同学能把理论和实际完全结合起来，成为适合于现代工厂所要求的工程师。例如去年暑期举行毕业考试时，我们曾聘请哈尔滨机械第十厂、第十四厂和电工四厂的总工程师来参加，他们对毕业同学都非常满意，因为好几个毕业同学所作的论文都是有用的，可以采用。如周国栋同学所设计的硬质合金车刀，不仅切合实用，而且可使产品减低成本；又如徐福格、李庆春等同学的毕业论文设计，某些工厂正在考虑部分地采用。
    最后，我来谈谈系及教研室的作用。教研室是教学工作最基本的组织，它不是按行政系统或专业组来划分的，而是按一门或几门同样性质的课程来划分的。教研室负责有关这一门或几门课程的整个教学问题。系主任则通过教研室来领导全系的教学工作，并检查教师的教学工作和同学的作业情况等。教研室要定期向系主任汇报教师的教学情况，教学方法以及科学研究等工作的进行情况；并保证有关课程的教学日历和教学计划的完成；此外，教研室要领导教师进行科学研究工作，搞好同学的科学研究小组。系主任则要保证全系教学计划的完成。
    系主任除检查教师的教学工作和了解同学的学习、作业、课程设计等情况外，还要负责对同学进行生活、政治思想教育。这一工作是通过班长来进行的。班长要经常向系主任报告班里同学的学习、生活等方面的情况。系主任如果发现同学有不努力学习或无故缺席的现象，就要分别找同学谈话，了解发生上述现象的原因，并向对方进行教育；若发觉某一个同学赶不上功课时，就设法进行帮助。
    根据我们的经验，只有有了坚强的系和教研室的领导，才能保证很好地完成教学工作。
    我们就是这样地根据苏联的先进经验，来培养着新中国的人民工程师的。
