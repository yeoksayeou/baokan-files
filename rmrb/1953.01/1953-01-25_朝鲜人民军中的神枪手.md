    Snipers in the Korean People's Army
    Chen Weiren
    Since January of last year, the soldiers of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, like their Chinese brothers-in-arms guarding the front lines, have enthusiastically engaged in the cold-blooded sniper campaign to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds. This movement has made the officers and soldiers of the American and Rhee bandit troops on the Korean front feel the threat of death at any time. By the end of September last year, according to incomplete statistics, they had killed or wounded more than 7,880 enemy soldiers. A large number of snipers have emerged from this movement.
    After a certain unit of the People's Army turned to this position for defensive operations, initially because the fortifications were not yet stable, the enemy's arrogance was quite high. Enemy planes often flew low to strafe, and the enemy often walked around on the position.
    Last January, the higher authorities called for a shift to active defense, and thus a sniper movement was launched among the soldiers of the People's Army to use cold shots to strike at the enemy's arrogance. This movement first unfolded in the first company of the first battalion, whose position was only forty meters away from the enemy. The position of the first company was lower than that of the enemy, and the soldiers called it "Shoe Hill." The first platoon was in the front, and the enemy chopped firewood, boiled water, and cooked meals in front of them every day, sometimes even cursing. The soldiers were really angry. One soldier said, "Shoot! Let's shoot!" He killed two American soldiers with one shot, so the soldiers rushed to fire. On another occasion, an enemy observer was shot down, and the enemy was baffled, not knowing where the bullets came from. From then on, they always stuck their feet out to test before going out. If there was no movement, they would run away for their lives, but often they would be shot down before they could run far, and they would die silently without even groaning. Some were shot dead, and no one dared to drag away their bodies.
    Snipers must not only be brave and diligent, but also patient, calm, and study the regularity of enemy activities. Squad Leader Che Xianglu of the first company is such an outstanding sniper. He has already killed many American soldiers, but he is not satisfied. He wants to shoot American officers. He studied the regularity of American officers' actions. He often lurked in front of the enemy's position at night, waiting for dawn to shoot them. Once he really waited for one. An American officer stood on the hillside looking around very proudly.
    "Bang!" With one shot, the officer somersaulted down the hillside, and the accompanying devils were so frightened that they ran away. Two hours later, another enemy helicopter came, planning to transport the officer's body back. Che Xianglu carried a light machine gun and hurried back, opening fire at a place seventy meters away from the body. As a result, the helicopter could no longer "helicopter." It had to lie in front of the People's Army position with the officer. By the end of September last year, Che Xianglu had killed or wounded 105 enemy soldiers and destroyed one helicopter. He was awarded the First Class National Flag Medal for this. Under his influence, two other outstanding snipers emerged in this unit: Zheng Bingdou, who killed or wounded 129 enemy soldiers, and Luo Yingkui, who killed or wounded 110 enemy soldiers.
    When this movement first started, it was still sporadic shooting, but later it became organized shooting. And the organization became more and more meticulous, and the experience became more and more abundant. Of course, the enemy quickly became vigilant, and they also wanted to shoot us. But our soldiers made full use of their wisdom and adopted various ingenious methods to strike at the enemy.
    A prisoner said: Some American soldiers were shot dead and wanted to get their bodies back, but no one was willing to do such a risky thing. So the higher authorities stipulated that whoever could bring back a body shot dead by a sniper of the People's Army would be rewarded with 2,000 to 3,000 US dollars, and would also be specially allowed to go to the rear for two to three days of rest; the bodies of officers were of course priced even higher. But even with such a high price, very few money-loving American soldiers were willing to do it, because going would surely lose their own lives.
    The bosses on Wall Street use money to buy American soldiers to come to Korea. After they are shot dead by the cold shots and cold guns of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the front lines, they must use money to buy the lives of those who share the same fate as the dead to "pull the corpses." But, at this time, money is also useless.

    朝鲜人民军中的神枪手
    陈维仁
    从去年一月份起，朝鲜人民军某部的战士们，和其他守卫着前沿阵地的中、朝兄弟部队一样，热烈地投入冷枪杀敌立功运动里去。这个运动已使朝鲜前线美李匪军的官兵们随时感到死亡的威胁。到去年九月底止，据不完全统计，他们已打死打伤敌人七千八百八十多名。大批的神枪手从这个运动中涌现出来。
    人民军某部在转入这个阵地进行防御作战之后，起初因为工事还不稳固，敌人的气焰相当高，敌机常常低飞扫射，敌人常常在阵地上走来走去。
    去年一月上级号召转入积极防御，于是在人民军战士中间，就展开了狙击手运动，用冷枪打击敌人的气焰。这个运动首先在阵地离敌人仅四十公尺远的一营一连里展开。一连的阵地比敌人的低，战士们把它叫做“鞋子高地”。一排在最前面，敌人每天在他们前面砍柴、烧水、做饭，有时竟还谩骂。战士们真气坏了。一个战士说：“打！打打看！”他一开枪两个美国兵就没了命，于是战士们就争先恐后地打起来。又有一次敌人的一个观测兵给打倒了，敌人莫名其妙，不知枪弹是从那儿来的。从那时起，他们出门总是先伸出脚试试，没有动静，就没命地飞跑，但常常跑不多远，就被打倒，连哼也不哼一声就无声无息地毙命了。有的被打死了连尸首也没有人敢来拖。
    狙击手不仅要勇敢、勤快，还要有耐心，要沉着，要研究敌人活动的规律性。一连的一个班长车相律就是这样一个出色的狙击手。他已经打死了不少美国兵；但他并不满足，他想打美国军官。他研究了美国军官行动的规律，他常在夜间就潜伏到敌人阵地前面去，等着天明好打他们。有一次真给他等到了，一个美国军官很神气地站在山坡上张望，
    “叭！”一枪，这个军官一个筋斗就从山坡上栽了下来，随行的鬼子吓得回头就跑。过了两个钟头，又来了一架鬼子的直升飞机，打算把这位军官的尸体运回去。车相律又扛着一挺轻机枪连忙赶回去，在离这个尸体七十来公尺的地方开了枪，于是这架直升飞机再也“直升”不起来了，它只好陪着这位军官躺在人民军的阵地前面。去年九月末，车相律已经打死打伤敌人一百零五名，打坏直升飞机一架。他因此获得了一级国旗勋章。在他的影响下，这个部队还出现了另外两个出色的狙击手：一个是打死打伤敌人一百二十九名的郑炳斗，一个是打死打伤敌人一百一十名的罗应奎。
    当这个运动刚开始时，还是零星地打，后来就成为有组织的打了。并且组织也愈来愈周密，经验也愈来愈丰富。当然敌人很快就警惕起来了，而且他们也想打我们。可是我们的战士充分地运用自己的智慧采取各种巧妙的方法打击敌人。
    一个俘虏说：有的美国兵被打死了，想把尸首弄回来，但谁也不肯去干这种冒险的事。于是上级就规定谁要能弄回一具被人民军冷枪打死的尸体，就赏美金二千至三千元，而且还可以特许到后方去休息两天至三天；军官的尸体当然出价更高些。但就是这样高的价格，爱钱如命的美国兵也很少有人愿意去干，因为去干就必定会把自己的性命丢掉。
    华尔街的老板们用钱把美国兵买到朝鲜来，等他们在阵地上被中、朝人民军队的冷枪冷炮打死之后，又必须用钱去买那些与死者命运相同的人们的命去“拉尸”。但是，到了这个时候，钱也有不中用的时候。
