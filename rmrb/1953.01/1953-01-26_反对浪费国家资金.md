    Oppose Wasting State Funds
    Today, this newspaper published news that several departments in the East China provinces were unwilling to hand over their budget surpluses to the state treasury and were instead rushing to spend the money at the end of last year. Their rush to spend money was, of course, not to purchase anything particularly necessary, but to purchase electric fans, or penicillin that exceeded the normal needs of the unit by more than ten times and was prone to lose its effectiveness. Some even engaged in deals with private merchants for delayed delivery or indefinite delivery, or had private merchants issue blank invoices in order to reimburse expenses under the 1952 budget.
    The responsible personnel of these units may verbally say that our country's large-scale economic construction has already begun, and that the greatest interest of our people at present is industrialization. But when they are so recklessly wasting state funds, they have completely forgotten about national industrialization. If it is said that they are intentionally or unintentionally hindering national industrialization, they have nothing to say. Because their erroneous practices absolutely cannot be concealed by terms such as "departmentalism" or "local perspective."
    Now, the East China Financial and Economic Committee has taken effective measures to correct the above-mentioned errors and has ordered the higher-level organs of the relevant units to seriously inspect and deal with these incidents that violate state financial discipline. This is completely correct.
    At the end of last year, similar situations also occurred in other regions. In some places, this even caused chaos in the market and created extremely bad impressions among the people. It is hoped that the financial and economic committees and financial supervision departments in various regions will conduct in-depth inspections and, with reference to the practices of the East China Financial and Economic Committee, effectively correct them in order to recover the state funds that should not have been lost. Appropriate punishment should also be given to staff members who violate state financial discipline. All regions should use these typical examples to educate all staff members to resolutely fight against phenomena that violate state financial discipline and waste state funds.

### 反对浪费国家资金

    反对浪费国家资金
    本报今天发表了华东各省若干部门不肯把预算的结余上缴国库，而在去年年底抢着把钱花掉的消息。他们抢着花钱，当然不是为了购买什么特别必要的东西，而是购买电扇，购买超过该单位正常需要十几倍而又易于失掉时效的青霉素等等。有的甚至去和私商作延期交货和无期交货的买卖，或者让私商开给空头发票，以便在一九五二年预算项下报销。
    这些单位的负责人员，口头上也许会说我们国家大规模经济建设已经开始，我国人民当前最大的利益是工业化。但他们在这样放肆地浪费国家资金的时候，却把国家工业化忘得无影无踪了。如果说他们是在有意无意地阻碍国家工业化，他们是无话可说的。因为他们的错误作法，绝对不能用“本位主义”、“局部观点”等说法加以掩饰。
    现在华东财政经济委员会已采取有效措施，纠正上述错误，并责令各有关单位的上级机关，认真检查、处理这些违反国家财政纪律的事件。这是完全正确的。
    在去年年底，其他地区也曾经发生类似情况。有的地方甚至因此引起了市场上的混乱，在人民群众当中造成极恶劣的印象。希望各地财政经济委员会和财政监察部门深入进行检查，并参考华东财政经济委员会的作法，有效地加以纠正，以挽回国家资金不应遭受的损失。并应给予违反国家财政纪律的工作人员以适当的处分。各地更应以这些典型事例，教育所有的工作人员，坚决与违反国家财政纪律、浪费国家资金的现象作斗争。
