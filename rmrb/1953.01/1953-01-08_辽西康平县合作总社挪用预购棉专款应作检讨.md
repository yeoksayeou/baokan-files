    Liaoxi Kangping County Cooperative Headquarters Should Self-Critique for Misappropriating Special Funds for Advance Cotton Purchases

    Editor: In order to solve the difficulties faced by farmers during spring plowing, the Kangping County Cotton Company of Liaoxi Province allocated 2,564,416,000 yuan to the county cooperative headquarters as special funds for advance cotton purchases on May 13th of last year, to be distributed to farmers by the cooperatives. However, the headquarters did not sign contracts with the grassroots cooperatives until August. Not only did the headquarters delay the allocation of funds, but they also deducted a large sum from the advance cotton purchase funds to settle the outstanding debts for pesticides owed by the grassroots cooperatives over the years. For example, the advance cotton purchase contract signed between the headquarters and the Guantun Cooperative in the First District was for 378,360,000 yuan, but the actual amount allocated to the Guantun Cooperative was only 56,750,000 yuan, with the remainder being deducted to offset debts for pesticides, etc. Similarly, the contract for the Hei'yatun Cooperative in the Tenth District was for 41,000,000 yuan, but they only received 3,000,000 yuan, with the remainder being deducted to offset outstanding pesticide debts. However, after deducting these funds, the headquarters concealed the fact and did not report it. When the county cotton company inquired about it, they claimed the funds were still with the lower levels. Later, when comrades from the provincial cotton company who were supervising advance purchases raised objections to their actions, they refused to disclose the actual amount deducted and insisted that their actions were correct. I believe that the Kangping County Cooperative Headquarters' egregious behavior is intolerable and should be subject to self-criticism.

    辽西康平县合作总社挪用预购棉专款应作检讨
    编辑同志：辽西省康平县棉花公司为了解决农民春耕困难，于去年五月十三日拨给该县合作总社预购棉花专款二十五亿六千四百十六万元，由合作社发给农民。但该社一直到八月才与各基层社签订合同。该社不但拖延了拨款时间，而且还从预购棉花款中扣出了一大笔作为结清与各基层社历年的农药尾欠之用。如该社与一区关屯社订的预购棉花合同是三亿七千八百三十六万多元，实际拨给关屯社的只五千六百七十五万多元，其余都被扣顶农药等欠款；又十区黑鸦屯社的合同是四千一百万元，实际领到的只三百万元，其余也被扣顶农药尾欠了。但该社扣除这批款后，一直隐瞒不报，等到县棉花公司来找，他们还说在下边。后来省棉花公司督促预购的同志，向他们提出意见，他们还拒绝谈出扣款实数，并认为他们这种做法是对的。康平县合作总社这种恶劣的行为，我认为是不能容忍的，应作检讨。    李玉贞
