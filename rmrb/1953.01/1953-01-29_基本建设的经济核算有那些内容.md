    What are the Economic Accounting Contents of Basic Construction?
    Question: What are the economic accounting contents of basic construction? How can we do a good job in the economic accounting work of basic construction?
    Answer: According to the current situation, the economic accounting in basic construction should have the following three important contents:
    I. Financial supervision and investment management. Through the review of investments, control the use of investments, and stipulate indicators for reducing construction and installation costs in basic construction; through financial management and supervision, ensure the correct use of investments. This is an important measure in the economic accounting work of basic construction, which should be continuously strengthened and appropriate systems should be added. In order to do this work well, we should continuously and resolutely fight against all views that violate financial regulations and disregard financial supervision.
    II. Repeatedly review the design to achieve the greatest economic accounting in basic construction. At present, the biggest economic accounting problem in basic construction is first and foremost the quality of each engineering design. If a design is unreasonable or does not adopt the advanced technical achievements that can be achieved, even the strictest financial supervision during construction will still cause huge waste of national investment; experience has proven that factories producing the same quantity and quality of products may have vastly different investments if the technical standards adopted in the design are different. Moreover, errors, faults, and shortcomings in the design can lead to long-term unreasonable conditions in the production of a factory or mine - low output, poor quality, and high costs. Therefore, carefully reviewing the conditions for site selection, raw material usage, determination of production scale, and technical conditions adopted in the design of a factory, mine, or other project encompasses the greatest significance of economic accounting; neglecting this work is equivalent to abandoning the most serious economic accounting work in basic construction.
    III. Discover and promote advanced experiences in the design and construction of basic construction. Paying attention to improving the political consciousness of technical personnel and workers, and supporting them in creating and promoting various advanced working methods in design and construction, can increase the speed of construction and greatly reduce construction costs. For example, the emergence of the "sectional assembly line operation method" in housing construction last year greatly increased the speed of housing construction. This is a huge economic accounting in basic construction.
    At present, some enterprise leaders, when talking about the economic accounting of basic construction, often only pay attention to investment management and financial supervision, and do not recognize the great significance of the two economic accounting measures of reviewing engineering designs and discovering and promoting advanced experience in design and construction for current basic construction. Therefore, we believe that in addition to continuing to strengthen the first type of economic accounting measures, we must also pay more attention to and seize the latter two tasks.

    基本建设的经济核算有那些内容
    问：基本建设的经济核算有那些内容？怎样才能做好基本建设的经济核算工作？
    答：根据目前情况，基本建设中的经济核算应该有下列三个重要内容：
    一、财政监督和投资管理。经过对于投资的审核，控制投资的使用，规定基本建设中降低建筑安装成本的指标；经过财务管理与监督，保证投资的正确运用。这是基本建设的经济核算工作中的一项重要措施，应该继续加强，并增订适当的制度。为了做好这个工作，我们应该不断地对一切违反财务制度、轻视财政监督的观点进行坚决的斗争。
    二、对设计加以反复的审核，来达到基本建设中最大的经济核算。目前基本建设中最大的经济核算问题，首先在每一工程设计的质量如何。假如一个设计不合理或者没有采取可能达到的先进技术成就，那么在施工中即使有最严格的财政监督，同样会造成国家投资的巨大浪费；经验证明：生产同等数量、同等质量产品的工厂，如果设计所采取的技术标准不同，投资可能相差很远。而且，设计上的错误、毛病和缺点，还会造成一个工厂、矿山长期生产上的不合理状况——产量低、质量坏、成本高。因此，认真审查一个工厂、矿山或其它工程设计的地址选择的条件、使用原材料的条件、生产规模的确定、采用的技术条件等等，包含了最大的经济核算的意义；如果忽视了这一工作，就等于放弃了基本建设中最严重的一项经济核算工作。
    三、在基本建设的设计与施工中，发现及推广先进经验。注意提高技术人员与职工的政治觉悟，支持他们在设计与施工中创造和推广各种先进工作方法，就可以增加建设的速度，大大降低建设成本。例如去年房屋建设中的“分段流水作业法”的出现，就使房屋建设的速度大大提高。这是基本建设中一种巨大的经济核算。
    目前某些企业领导干部在谈到基本建设的经济核算时，往往只注意了投资管理和财政监督，而没有认识对工程设计的审核以及在设计施工中发现和推广先进经验这两种经济核算措施对于目前基本建设的重大意义。因此，我们认为：除了应该继续加强第一种经济核算的措施外，还必须更加重视和抓紧后两项工作。
