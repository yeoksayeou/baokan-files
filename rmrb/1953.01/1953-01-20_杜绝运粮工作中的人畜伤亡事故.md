    Eliminate Human and Livestock Casualties in Grain Transportation Work
    Today, this newspaper published news of human and livestock casualties in grain transportation work in some areas of Northeast China. This should attract everyone's attention, because similar accidents also exist in other areas.
    Why do human and livestock casualties occur every year in grain transportation work? The main reason is that some cadres with bureaucratic work styles believe that such accidents are unavoidable. Therefore, they do not take necessary measures or provide specific leadership to prevent these accidents from happening. After human and livestock casualties occurred in Yongji County, Jilin Province, the People's Government convened an emergency meeting. The district chief of the Sixth District of the county even said: "Last year (1951), Yongji County had 49 human and livestock casualties, and no meeting was held. This year (1952), only nine occurred, and now we are having a meeting." According to this person, since the human and livestock casualties in 1952 were fewer than in 1951, this is already a great "progress," or even a great "achievement." They simply do not realize that even one human or livestock casualty in grain transportation is an unacceptable fault and mistake. Precisely because they believe that human and livestock casualties are unavoidable, they do not properly organize the grain transportation and storage work. They do not check the attendance of people and livestock, allowing the elderly, young children, and pregnant women to carry grain or drive carts to deliver grain, or allowing timid and easily frightened livestock to drive carts to transport grain. They do not set up people to stand guard and direct traffic at dangerous road crossings; they do not repair damaged roads and bridges; they just sit there, waiting for "unavoidable" human and livestock casualties. This is completely wrong. Now, the Northeast People's Government has conducted serious and conscientious handling of the relevant leading cadres in areas where human and livestock casualties have occurred in grain transportation work, and has given the district chief of the Sixth District of Yongji County, Jilin Province, a demotion, which is entirely correct.
    At present, the national autumn grain collection work has been largely completed, and grain transportation work is underway in many places. We suggest that the leading cadres in these areas pay close attention to the organization and inspection of grain transportation work, and completely eliminate human and livestock casualties. Areas that have completed grain transportation work should conduct serious inspections and summaries. Units and relevant cadres that ensure safe storage should be commended and rewarded; units and relevant cadres where human and livestock casualties occurred should be investigated to determine the causes, and those who are negligent should be given the punishment they deserve; farmers who have suffered losses due to human and livestock casualties should be compensated for their losses and properly handled in the aftermath; and these specific examples should be used to educate cadres and farmers to resolutely eliminate the occurrence of human and livestock casualties in grain transportation work.

### 杜绝运粮工作中的人畜伤亡事故

    杜绝运粮工作中的人畜伤亡事故
    今天本报发表了东北部分地区在运粮工作中发生人、畜伤亡事故的消息，应该引起大家高度的注意。因为同样的事故在其他地区也是存在的。
    为什么每年在运粮工作中都要发生人、畜伤亡事故呢？主要的原因在于某些有官僚主义作风的干部认为这种事故是不可避免的。因此，他们就不去采取必要的措施，进行具体的领导，以防止发生这种事故了。吉林省永吉县人民政府在发生人畜伤亡事故后召开了紧急会议，该县第六区区长竟说：“去年（一九五一年）永吉县发生人畜伤亡事故四十九件都没有开会，今年（一九五二年）仅发生九件倒开会了。”照这种人看来，一九五二年发生的人、畜伤亡事故既然比一九五一年少，这已是很大的“进步”，甚至是很大的“成绩”了。他们根本没有认识即使在运粮中发生一件人畜伤亡事故，都是不可容许的过失和错误。正因为他们认为人畜伤亡事故不可避免，所以就不去很好地组织运粮入库工作了。他们不去检查人畜出勤的情况，让老头、幼童、孕妇背粮或赶车送粮，让胆小好惊的牲口去驾车运粮；在险要道口不设人站岗指挥；对损坏了的道路桥梁又不加修理；只是坐在那里，等待“不可避免”的人畜伤亡事故。这是完全错误的。现在东北人民政府对于在运粮工作中发生了人、畜伤亡事故地区的有关领导干部，分别进行了严肃认真的处理，给吉林省永吉县第六区的区长以撤职处分，这是完全正确的。
    目前，全国秋征工作已大部完成，许多地方的运粮工作正在进行。我们建议这些地区的领导干部，要十分注意运粮工作的组织和检查，完全杜绝人畜伤亡事故。已经完成运粮工作的地区，应该认真进行检查和总结，对于安全入库的单位和有关干部，应该表扬和奖励；对于发生人畜伤亡事故的单位和有关干部，应该追究原因，给失职者应得的处分；对于发生了人畜伤亡事故损失的农民，应该赔偿损失，很好地进行善后工作；并应以这些具体事例教育干部和农民，坚决杜绝运粮工作中人畜伤亡事故的发生。
