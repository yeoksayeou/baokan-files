    Central Textile Industry Ministry Holds Another Capital Construction Meeting
    Determines to Accelerate the Completion of All Important Preparatory Work for Capital Construction
    In order to rapidly complete the preparatory work for capital construction in 1953, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government held another capital construction meeting from December 15th to 23rd, 1952. The meeting summarized the experiences and lessons learned from capital construction over the past three years; reviewed the current situation of various textile administration bureaus establishing capital construction organizations and concentrating capital construction forces; specifically studied the implementation methods for various capital construction tasks in 1953, and determined the important preparatory work that should be accelerated at present.
    The Central Textile Industry Ministry has achieved considerable success and learned valuable lessons in its past capital construction work. Over the past three years, six modern textile factories and a large-scale textile machinery manufacturing factory have been built in various parts of the country, with a total construction area of 600,000 square meters. Most of the cotton textile factories were designed by Chinese designers and all used domestically produced materials and machinery. This is a major event in the history of China's textile industrial construction. In the construction of the Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory, thanks to the efforts of the factory construction cadres and workers, as well as the assistance of local Party and government organs and brother factories, it only took one year from construction to formal production, and the civil engineering and installation projects generally met the standards. After the factory started operation, its output has reached the level of general advanced factories. The Harbin Flax Factory, designed and constructed with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, adopted the most advanced technical standards. However, due to the past leadership cadres' insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of capital construction, many shortcomings and errors occurred. First of all, many factory construction cadres had a mentality of eagerness for quick success, which led to some factories not being thorough enough in surveying and design, and some factories being sloppy in construction. For example, when constructing the factory buildings for the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory, the phenomenon of subsidence of the factory building column foundation occurred because insufficient attention was paid to site selection and geological survey beforehand. During the construction of the Wuhan First Cotton Textile Factory, problems such as cracks in the columns and insufficient water sources occurred, causing unnecessary losses to the country. Secondly, some cadres had a dependency mentality, and all surveying, design, and construction were outsourced, so they could not accumulate strength and experience well through factory construction work.
    In order to do a good job in capital construction in 1953, after the Ministry of Textile Industry held a capital construction meeting at the end of October 1952, various textile administration bureaus actively transferred cadres from the production side to establish and improve capital construction organizations. At present, units with new factory construction tasks have already carried out comprehensive surveying work. The newly formed five civil engineering construction companies now have nearly 10,000 permanent workers. Under the unified leadership of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee, the Harbin Engineering Company began winter training on December 15th, and the remaining companies will also begin successively in the near future. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the ministry's design company is studying the design standards for various new factories and will soon be able to compile preliminary designs. The business personnel required for construction management in 1953 also began training in Tianjin in early December, and 500 people will be transferred to various places to participate in the work in March 1953. The construction personnel training class is scheduled to begin on January 15th, 1953.
    In order to do a good job in capital construction in 1953, the meeting decided
    The tasks for the winter of 1952 and the first quarter of 1953 are as follows:
    (1) Strengthen the design company, and accelerate the design of new factories based on the principles of technical feasibility and economic rationality. (2) Strengthen the winter training of permanent workers, improve workers' political awareness, and learn advanced technologies; improve organizational leadership, and overcome the waiting mentality of relying solely on external assistance. (3) Strengthen capital construction management, and establish financial, material and other systems. (4) Fully prepare plans for the supply of materials related to construction, and formulate systems for construction management and economic accounting. (5) The administration bureaus with factory construction tasks must enrich and strengthen the capital construction organizations. (6) Strengthen the connection between factory construction units and local Party and government organs and various aspects, and obtain strong local assistance. (Quan Wu)

    中央纺织工业部再次召开基本建设会议
    确定加速完成基本建设各项重要准备工作
    中央人民政府纺织工业部，为迅速完成一九五三年基本建设的准备工作，在一九五二年十二月十五日到二十三日，再次召开基本建设会议。会议总结了三年来基本建设的经验教训；检查了目前各地纺织管理局建立基本建设机构和集中基本建设力量的情况；具体研究了一九五三年基本建设各项工作的实施方法，确定当前应加速完成的各项重要准备工作。
    中央纺织工业部在以往基本建设工作中，取得了不少成绩和经验教训。三年中，在全国各地，先后建设了六个现代化的纺织厂，一个规模巨大的纺织机器制造厂，建筑面积总数达六十万平方公尺。其中多数棉纺织厂，是中国设计人员设计的，而且全部采用国产材料与机器。这是中国纺织工业建设史上的一件大事。西北第一棉纺织厂在建厂中，由于建厂干部和职工的努力，及地方党政机关和兄弟厂的帮助，从施工到转入正式生产，只用了一年的时间，土木及安装等工程一般合乎标准。该厂在开工之后，产量已达到一般先进厂的水平。哈尔滨亚麻厂，在苏联专家热情帮助下设计和施工，都采用了最先进的技术标准。但是，由于过去领导干部对基本建设的艰巨性与复杂性认识不够，产生了不少缺点和错误。首先，不少建厂干部，存在着急于求成的思想，以致有些厂勘测和设计不够周密，有些厂施工草率。如建设经纬纺织机器制造厂厂房时，因为事先对厂址选择和地质勘测重视不够，发生厂房柱基下沉现象。武汉第一棉纺织厂在建厂中，曾发生柱子裂缝和水源不足等情况，给国家造成不应有的损失。其次，有些干部存在着依赖思想，勘测、设计和施工都外包了，因而不能通过建厂工作，很好地积蓄力量，积累经验。
    为做好一九五三年基本建设工作，各地纺织管理局，在纺织工业部于一九五二年十月底召开基本建设会议后，都积极从生产方面抽调干部，建立和健全基本建设机构。目前，有新建厂任务的单位，已经进行全面的勘测工作。新组成的五个土木建筑工程公司，现已固定工人将近一万名。哈尔滨工程公司已在中共哈尔滨市委统一领导下，于十二月十五日开始进行冬季整训工作，其余各公司亦将在最近陆续开始。该部设计公司，在苏联专家指导下，正在研究各新建厂的设计标准，不久即可编绘初步设计。一九五三年施工管理所需要的业务人员，十二月初也开始在天津训练，一九五三年三月即可调出五百人，分派各地参加工作。施工人员训练班，定于一九五三年一月十五日开始。
    为做好一九五三年的基本建设工作，会议决定
    一九五二年冬和一九五三年第一季的任务如下：
    （一）加强设计公司，根据技术可能与经济合理的原则，加速新建厂设计工作。（二）加强固定工人的冬训工作，提高工人政治觉悟，学习先进技术；健全组织领导，克服单纯依靠外力援助的等待思想。（三）加强基本建设管理工作，建立财务、材料等制度。（四）充分做好施工方面有关材料供应的计划等工作，制定关于施工管理及经济核算等制度。（五）有建厂任务的管理局，必须充实和加强基本建设机构。（六）加强建厂单位与当地党政机关以及各方面的联系，取得地方上的大力援助。  （全吾）
