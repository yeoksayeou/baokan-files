(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 31st) General Nam Il, chief delegate of our side to the Korean armistice talks, protested to the other side on December 30th regarding the incidents of the US side killing our captured personnel in the POW camps on Jeju Island, Busan, and Geoje Island on December 24th and 25th. General Nam Il pointed out that since the start of the armistice talks, according to the other side's own public reports, they have killed or wounded more than 3,059 of our captured personnel. Our side has lodged 45 protests regarding this, but the other side has never provided any explanation for our protests. The other side uses the brutal means of massacring POWs to create the absurd excuse of detaining POWs and interrupting the armistice talks. By rejecting the Soviet Union's absolutely fair and reasonable peace proposal at the United Nations, based on the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, to first achieve a ceasefire in Korea, their purpose is clearly to prolong and expand the Korean War, and further undermine peace in the Far East and the world. General Nam Il solemnly pointed out: The other side will never escape the historical responsibility for this series of war crimes.

On the same day, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, on the order of General Nam Il, demanded that the other side strictly abide by the agreements between the two sides regarding the Korean armistice talks conference area, neutral zone, etc., and cease the various incidents violating the agreements that the other side has continuously created since the interruption of the armistice talks on October 8th. Colonel Zhang Chunshan solemnly warned the other side that the continued destruction of these agreements would lead to very serious consequences.

On the same day, at the liaison officers' meeting, our side informed the other side that Colonel Zhu Ran of the Korean People's Army had been appointed as the chief liaison officer of our delegation, replacing Colonel Zhang Chunshan. The full texts of the two protests from General Nam Il and Colonel Zhang Chunshan are as follows:

General Nam Il's protest to Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation:

On December 24th, your side killed two of our captured personnel in the POW camps on Jeju Island and Busan. On December 25th, your side killed one more of our captured personnel in the POW camp on Geoje Island. This is yet another sinful act of your continued massacre of POWs following the large-scale massacre in the Pongam-do POW camp, and I lodge a serious protest to you regarding this.

Since the beginning of the armistice negotiations, according to your own public reports and the reports of the International Committee of the Red Cross, your side has killed or wounded more than 3,059 of our captured personnel. In reality, the number of our unarmed captured personnel who have died or been injured by your bloody hands far exceeds this number. Regarding your side's endless stream of such crimes, since February 23, 1952, I have lodged 45 protests to your side, but your side has never provided a single explanation. Your side dares not explain, your side cannot explain, and your side has no way to explain. You think that you can shirk your serious responsibility for massacring POWs with this shameful silence. However, the heroic and unyielding resistance of our captured personnel and the public confessions of your former POW camp commanders Dodd and Colson have long exposed to the people of the world your cruel face of massacring POWs in order to detain POWs. Since the discussion of the POW issue began, your side has used the absurd excuses of so-called voluntary repatriation, so-called non-forcible repatriation, and so-called non-use of force for repatriation to obstruct the reasonable resolution of the POW issue in every possible way. Facts have proven that it is your side that has consistently used violence, violated international law, and adopted inhumane and barbaric methods to carry out so-called "screening," "re-screening," "persuasion," and "consultation" on our captured personnel, coercing them to betray their motherland, express "unwillingness to return home," and be willing to be detained by your side to serve as so-called cannon fodder for "Asians fighting Asians." The principle you adhere to is the principle of massacring and detaining POWs, and you should know that this is absolutely not permissible. In fact, your side is only creating these absurd excuses for detaining POWs in order to prolong and expand the Korean War. Your side interrupted the armistice talks and rejected the absolutely fair and reasonable peace proposal put forward by the Soviet Union at the United Nations to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire in Korea on the basis of the agreements already reached by both sides, and to hand over the issue of complete repatriation of POWs to the committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and has further increasingly seriously undermined the agreements concerning the conference area and neutral zone for the armistice talks, shaking the foundation of the armistice talks. Your true intention is to prolong and expand the Korean War, and further undermine peace in the Far East and the world. Any atrocity of massacring POWs and any proposal for detaining POWs is not permissible. To prolong and expand the Korean War under the pretext of the absurd claim of detaining POWs is even more impermissible to the peace-loving people of the whole world. Your side will never escape the historical responsibility for this series of war crimes.

December 30, 1952

Colonel Zhang Chunshan's protest to Colonel McColaugh, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Since your side unilaterally adjourned the armistice talks on October 8th, your side has disregarded the conference area and neutral zone agreements and continuously created incidents that violate the agreements. In less than three months, your side shelled the Panmunjom conference area three times, and distributed slanderous leaflets in the conference area twice. Your military aircraft have flown over the conference area 27 times, frequently and continuously intruding into the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone, and even bombed and strafed vehicles of our delegation, injuring staff members of our delegation. Although your side has repeatedly claimed that it has taken necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of incidents that violate the agreements, in fact, your side's acts of violating the agreements still occur one after another. Even on December 26th, from 14:10 to 14:20, your military aircraft violated the agreement again and intruded into the airspace of the conference area twice. It must be reminded to your side that the agreements between the two sides on the conference area, neutral zone, etc. are the only valid agreements currently concerning the Korean armistice talks. The continued destruction of these agreements will lead to very serious consequences. On the order of our chief delegate, I once again solemnly demand that your side strictly abide by the agreements and take concrete and effective measures to prevent the recurrence of incidents that violate the agreements.

    南日将军抗议美方继续屠杀战俘
    我联络官警告对方不要再破坏会场区协议
    【新华社开城三十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军十二月三十日向对方抗议美方在十二月二十四日及二十五日又在济州岛、釜山和巨济岛各战俘营中杀害我方被俘人员的事件。南日将军指出，自停战谈判开始以来，仅据对方公开报道对方已杀伤三千零五十九名以上我方被俘人员，对此我方提出四十五次抗议，而对方对我方历次抗议始终未作任何交代。对方以屠杀战俘的残暴手段，来制造扣留战俘的荒谬借口，中断停战谈判，在联合国拒绝苏联绝对公平合理的根据双方协议的停战协定草案首先在朝鲜停战的和平建议，其目的显然在于延长和扩大朝鲜战争，进一步破坏远东与世界和平。南日将军严正指出：对方将永远不能逃脱这一系列战争罪行的历史责任。
    同日，我方首席联络官张春山上校奉南日将军之命，要求对方严格遵守双方对朝鲜停战谈判会场区、中立区等协议，中止对方自十月八日中断停战谈判以来所连续制造的各种违反协议的事件。张春山上校郑重警告对方对于这些协议的继续破坏将引起甚为严重的后果。
    同日双方联络官会上，我方通知对方，朝鲜人民军朱然上校被任命为我方代表团首席联络官，以代替张春山上校。南日将军与张春山上校的两项抗议全文如下：
    南日将军的抗议联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    十二月二十四日你方在济州岛战俘营与釜山战俘营害死我方被俘人员两人，十二月二十五日你方又在巨济岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员一人，这是你方继蜂岩岛战俘营大屠杀以后继续屠杀战俘的又一次罪恶行为，对此我向你提出严重抗议。
    自从停战谈判开始以来，仅据你方公开报道和红十字国际委员会的报告，你方已经打死打伤三千零五十九名以上的我方被俘人员，实际上我方手无寸铁的被俘人员死伤于你方血手之下的远超过此数。对你方此类层出不穷的罪行，从一九五二年二月二十三日起，我向你方提出过四十五次抗议，而你方从未作过一次交代。你方不敢交代，你方不能交代，你方也无从交代。你们以为用这种可耻的沉默就可以推卸你方屠杀战俘的严重责任。但我方被俘人员英勇不屈的反抗和你方前任战俘营长官杜德和柯尔生的公开招供，早就在全世界人民面前揭穿了你方为扣留战俘而进行的屠杀战俘的凶残面貌。自从战俘问题开始讨论以来，你方就假借所谓自愿遣返，所谓不得强迫遣返和所谓不得使用武力进行遣返的荒谬借口，百般阻挠战俘问题的合理解决。事实证明正是你方一贯使用暴力，违反国际公法，采取灭绝人性的野蛮手段，对我方被俘人员进行所谓“甄别”、“再甄别”、“劝导”、“征询”，胁迫他们背叛祖国，表示“不愿回家”而愿意被你方扣留充当你方的所谓以“亚洲人打亚洲人”的炮灰。你方所坚持的原则就是屠杀和扣留战俘的原则，而你方应该知道这是绝对不能容许的。其实你方只是为了延长和扩大朝鲜战争，才造出这些扣留战俘的荒谬借口的。你方中断停战谈判，并在联合国拒绝苏联所提在双方已达成的协议的基础上实现朝鲜全面停火，将战俘全部遣返问题交由和平解决朝鲜问题委员会解决的绝对公平合理的和平建议，并进而日益严重地破坏有关停战谈判会场区与中立区的协议，动摇停战谈判的基础。你方的真正目的是延长和扩大朝鲜战争，进一步破坏远东与世界和平。任何屠杀战俘的暴行和扣留战俘的主张是不能容许的。以扣留战俘的荒谬主张为借口延长并扩大朝鲜战争，更为全世界爱好和平的人民所不许。你方将永远不能逃脱这一系列战争罪行的历史责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
    首席代表南日将军
    一九五二年十二月三十日
    张春山上校的抗议联合国军代表团首席联络官麦卡塞上校：
    自从十月八日你方片面休会中断停战谈判以来，你方无视会场区与中立区协议，连续造成了破坏协议的事件。在不到三个月的时间内，你方三次炮击板门店会场区，两次在会场区内散发诬蔑性的传单。你方军用飞机飞越会场区达二十七架次，经常不断地侵入开城中立区上空，更轰炸扫射我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团工作人员。你方虽然屡次声称已采取必要措施使违反协议的事件不再发生，而事实上你方破坏协议的行为却仍然层出不穷地发生。即在十二月二十六日十四时十分至十四时二十分，你方军用飞机又违反协议，两次侵入会场区上空。必须提醒你方，双方对会场区中立区等协议是有关朝鲜停战谈判事宜的目前唯一有效的协议。对于这些协议的继续破坏，将引起甚为严重的后果。我奉我方首席代表之命，再次郑重要求你方严格遵守协议，采取确实有效措施，使违反协议的事件不再发生。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席联络官张春山上校
    一九五二年十二月三十日
