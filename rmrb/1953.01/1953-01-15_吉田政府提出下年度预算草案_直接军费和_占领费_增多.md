Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Yoshida government has preliminarily drafted a general accounting budget proposal for the 1953 fiscal year (April 1953 to March 1954). This budget proposal demonstrates that Japan's finances are serving the policy of re-militarization.

According to the decision of the Yoshida Cabinet's regular meeting on the 13th, the total budget for the new fiscal year is initially set at 950 billion yen (360 yen to one US dollar). This is the largest budget since the war, exceeding the total budget for the 1952 fiscal year (including supplementary budgets) of 932.5 billion yen. It is particularly noteworthy that the Yoshida government plans to allocate at least 220 billion yen in the new fiscal year for direct military spending and the maintenance costs of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, including the disguised "occupation costs" for the U.S. occupation forces, the so-called "Defense Expenditure Fee" of 62 billion yen, the "Security Agency" funding of 93 billion yen, "Allied Property Compensation Fee" and "Post-War Restoration and Settlement Fee" of 20 billion yen, and old soldiers' subsidies – "Pensions" – of 45 billion yen.

The "Security Agency" funding has increased significantly. In the 1952 fiscal year, the "Security Agency" funding was over 59.1 billion yen, and now it has increased by more than 57 percent. Kyodo News Agency revealed that the Yoshida government plans to use part of the new appropriation to build a total of fifteen escort frigates and minesweepers, as well as approximately fifty land and naval aircraft each. The Yoshida government also plans to transfer more than 100 billion yen in surplus funds from the 1951 and 1952 fiscal years to the 1953 fiscal year as part of the military spending.

The "occupation costs" under the name of "Defense Expenditure Fee," although superficially reduced by 3 billion yen compared to the 65 billion yen in the 1952 fiscal year, Kyodo News Agency revealed that "in addition to this amount (62 billion yen), Japan is expected to pay approximately 6 billion yen in purchase fees, rental fees, and compensation fees for the land and buildings required by the U.S. military." Japan's continued burden of "occupation costs" once again illustrates the hypocrisy of Japan's "independence."

During the process of drafting the budget proposal by the Yoshida government, the U.S. authorities repeatedly advocated for even greater increases in military spending. However, the Yoshida government, plagued by the depletion of financial resources and the opposition of the people, was unable to fully satisfy the demands of its American masters. As the Yoshida government's rearmament policy has been opposed by the broad masses of the people and dissatisfied with by opposition parties, it is expected that the Yoshida government's budget proposal will face strong opposition in the Diet.

    吉田政府提出下年度预算草案
    直接军费和“占领费”增多
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：吉田政府已经初步拟就了一九五三会计年度（一九五三年四月到一九五四年三月）一般会计预算草案。这个预算草案显示，日本的财政是服务于重新军国主义化政策的。
    根据吉田内阁十三日例会的决定，新会计年度的预算总额，初步定为九千五百亿日元（三百六十日元合一美元），这是战后最庞大的预算，超过了包括补充预算在内的一九五二会计年度的预算总额（九千三百二十五亿日元）。特别值得注意的是，吉田政府准备在新会计年度中至少拨款二千二百亿日元充当直接军费和驻日美国占领军的维持费，其中包括拨给美国占领军的变相“占领费”所谓“防御支出费”六百二十亿日元，“保安厅”经费九百三十亿日元，“盟国财产补偿费”和“恢复和平善后处理费”二百亿日元，旧军人的补助费——“年金”——四百五十亿日元。
     “保安厅”的经费有了显著的增加。在一九五二会计年度，“保安厅”的经费是五百九十一亿多日元，现在增加了百分之五十七以上。共同社透露，吉田政府准备将新拨款的一部分建造护航快舰和扫雷艇共十五艘以及陆、海军飞机各五十架左右。吉田政府还准备将一九五一和一九五二两个会计年度的余款一千多亿日元，转帐到一九五三会计年度充当军费的一部分。
    以“防御支出费”为名义的“占领费”，虽然表面上比一九五二会计年度的六百五十亿日元减少了三十亿日元，但是，共同社透露，“在这个数目（六百二十亿日元）以外，预料日本将为美国驻军所需要的土地及建筑物付出购买费、租费及赔偿费约六十亿日元”。日本继续负担“占领费”，再次说明了日本“独立”的虚伪本质。
    在吉田政府编制预算草案的过程中，美国当局曾经一再主张把军事费用增加得更多。但是，吉田政府苦于财源的枯竭和人民的反对，没有能够完全满足它的美国主子的要求。由于吉田政府的备战政策已经遭到广大人民的反对和在野党派的不满，预料吉田政府的预算草案将在国会中遭到强烈的反对。
