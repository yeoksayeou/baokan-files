    Beijing Garment Factory Actively Solves Employee Welfare Problems
    The Beijing Garment Factory is actively resolving employee welfare issues. To ensure that employees have sufficient rest and study time, the factory has changed from a nine-hour work system to an eight-hour work system. Fifteen hundred new employee dormitories have been built, and many employees' families have moved into the new housing. In terms of safety and hygiene, protective equipment such as work clothes, gloves, goggles, and masks have been issued, and female employees have been given sanitary napkins and bean paper. To increase the nutrition of employees suffering from chronic diseases, a milk station has been added, where each person can drink half a pound of milk every morning. The factory has also built a nursery that can accommodate one hundred children and a primary school for the children of employees. Currently, the factory's attendance rate has greatly improved. In November 1952, the employee absenteeism rate decreased by 2.49 percent compared to June 1952. At the same time, workers' enthusiasm for production has also increased. Wang Yujing, a maintenance worker, and Yang Peilin, a technician, successfully researched a two-needle quilting machine, which doubled the output of quilting work.

    北京被服厂积极解决有关职工福利的问题。为使职工有充分的休息和学习时间，该厂已将原来九小时工作制改为八小时工作制。现已新建了一千五百间职工宿舍，许多职工家属都已搬进新房居住。在安全卫生方面，现已发了工作服、手套、风镜、口罩等防护用品，还给女职工发了卫生棉和豆纸。为了增加患慢性疾病的职工的营养，已添设了牛奶站，每人每天早晨可以喝到半磅牛奶。该厂还新建了可容纳一百名小孩的托儿所和子弟小学。目前该厂的出勤率大大提高了，一九五二年十一月份，职工缺勤率较一九五二年六月份降低百分之二点四九。同时，工人们的生产积极性也提高了。保全工王玉景和技术人员杨培林等，研究两针行棉机成功，使行棉活的产量提高一倍。
