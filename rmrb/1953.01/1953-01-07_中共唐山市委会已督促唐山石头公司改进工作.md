Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of People's Daily

    To the People's Daily Reader's Letters Group: After the "Reader's Letters Page" published the letter "Tangshan Public Stone Company Should Not Deduct Workers' Wages in Disguise" on June 25th last year, we failed to promptly supervise and inspect, causing the problem to not be resolved in a timely manner. On November 5th, the "Reader's Letters Page" published the letter "Tangshan Public Stone Company Failed to Improve Actual Work After Accepting Criticism." On the same day, we instructed the General Branch Committee of the CCP Tangshan Stone Company to conduct an inspection; on November 10th, we held an industrial conference, and the full text of the letter of criticism was conveyed at the meeting. A special inspection team was immediately formed to conduct an inspection. We are now informing you of our inspection results and handling opinions:

    The company originally paid each worker 16.5 jin of corn for chiseling one meter of stone, which included wages, tool costs, tool loss fees, and expenses for digging soil, buying gunpowder, and fuses. From October 1951, the company was responsible for digging soil, buying gunpowder, and fuses; therefore, workers received 14 jin of corn (equivalent to 4.5 fen) for chiseling one meter of stone. We believe that tool and tool loss fees should be separated from wages and not confused. Tools can be the responsibility of the company, with unified allocation and use. As for whether wages should be reduced or by how much, it should be calculated based on the company's profit principle and the city's wage standards, and worker representative meetings should be convened for specific research and discussion to resolve the issue, which is conducive to production.

    The problem of over-measuring stone and underpaying was caused by unscientific stone measurement methods, simply measuring it on the truck with a ruler, which is not easy to measure accurately. At the same time, some measurers and receivers have the idea of "rather more than less" when receiving stones, fearing that if they receive less, they will not be able to account for it when they are transported to the construction site. In order to measure the stone accurately, the company should use the scientific "weighing" method for receiving and measuring. However, this requires some expenses. If the company's economic conditions are insufficient, it can be gradually resolved. Before it is fully resolved, the company should strengthen the education of measurers and receivers, and improve the technology and accuracy of receiving and measuring stone materials.

    The problem of the company's backlog of stone debris is relatively common and serious, which has a bad influence on production and workers' lives. We should actively plan and try to solve it.

    Finally, the company should strengthen ideological education for medical personnel and change the working hours of the clinic to meet the needs of workers. The company's original decision to build a canteen, auditorium, and tool room, and the decision to issue wages for holidays, had been approved by relevant superiors, but were not implemented. Now that winter has arrived, the canteen, auditorium, and tool room cannot be built. The company's administrative cadres should review their work shortcomings with the workers and tell them that construction will be carried out in 1953. The method of issuing wages for holidays should be implemented according to the approved date.

    We have instructed the Party organizations of the Municipal Committee's Industrial Department and the Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau to urge the Party organization of the Tangshan Stone Company to ensure the implementation of the above improvement measures.

### 中共唐山市委会已督促唐山石头公司改进工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共唐山市委会已督促唐山石头公司改进工作
    人民日报读者来信组：去年六月二十五日“读者来信专页”发表了“唐山公营石头公司不该变相尅扣工人工资”的来信后，我们未能及时督促检查，致使问题不能及时解决。十一月五日“读者来信专页”又发表了“唐山公营石头公司接受批评后却未改进实际工作”的来信。当日，我们即责成中共唐山石头公司总支委员会进行检查；十一月十日我们召开工业会议，又将批评信全文在会上作了传达，并立即组成专门检查小组进行检查。现将我们的检查结果及处理意见告诉你们：
    该公司每个工人凿一公尺石头，原来可得十六斤半玉米，其中包括工资、工具费、工具损失费以及起土、买炮药、炮信等费用。一九五一年十月份起，起土、买炮药、炮信由公司负责；因此，工人凿一公尺石头得十四斤玉米（合四分半）。我们认为：工具和工具损失费应与工资分开，不应混淆。工具可由公司负责，统一调拨使用。至于工资是否减少或减少多少，应根据公司利润原则和本市工资标准计算，召开工人代表会议具体研究讨论解决，以利生产。
    关于多收石、少给钱的问题，发生原因是量石头的办法不科学，只是装在车上用尺量一下，不易量准，同时，有些量收员收石时有“宁多勿少”的思想，怕少收了运到工地交代不下去。为了使石料量得准确，该公司应用科学的“过磅”办法收量。但这需要一部分开支，如公司经济条件不足，可以逐渐解决。在未全部解决前，该公司应加强对量收员的教育，提高收量石料的技术和准确性。
    该公司积压毛碴问题是比较普遍而严重的，这对生产和工人生活都有不好的影响。应该积极筹划，设法解决。
    最后，该公司应该对医务人员加强思想教育，并且改变医疗所的工作时间，以符合工人需要。该公司原定修建食堂，礼堂和工具房以及决定假日补发工资的问题，已经有关上级批准，但未执行。现在已到冬季，食堂、礼堂和工具房已不能修建，公司行政干部应向工人检讨工作缺点，并告诉工人一九五三年进行修建。假日补发工资的办法应按批准日期执行。
    以上改进工作的办法，我们已指示市委工业部和市人民政府企业局党组织督促唐山市石头公司党组织保证执行。
