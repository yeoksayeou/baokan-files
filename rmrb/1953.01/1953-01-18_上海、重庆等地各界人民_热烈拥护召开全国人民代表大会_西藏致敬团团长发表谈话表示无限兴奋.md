Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: People from all walks of life in Shanghai, Chongqing, Changsha, and Lanzhou unanimously and enthusiastically endorse the convening of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, and have resolved to take practical actions to welcome this historically significant undertaking.
    Sheng Pihua, the first convener of the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: "Convening the National and local people's congresses at all levels at the beginning of national economic construction will more effectively unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the people. Our democratic parties will work hard to make all preparations to welcome the upcoming election work." Zhong Min, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, stated: "Shanghai's workers will, together with people from all walks of life, continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, guarantee the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of the first year's construction plan, and actively participate in the general election work." Chen Wangdao, President of Fudan University, who has fought for democratic causes for many years, said: "For half a century, countless people have shed blood and sacrificed their lives for the cause of democracy. But in the past, all efforts failed. Only today, when the people are in power, can we achieve true democracy. Therefore, we must cherish it and do a good job in the election work." Yang Xingfen, a representative of the Baxianfang Family Women's Federation in Songshan District, Shanghai, said: "I must do a good job in propaganda work so that every family woman can understand the significance of the general election and elect the best people to be people's representatives with a sense of ownership and responsibility."
    The Chongqing Municipal Committees of the democratic parties held a symposium on the 16th to discuss the issue of convening the National People's Congress. Zhang Pingjiang, Standing Committee member of the Preparatory Committee of the Chongqing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "In the past three years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the efforts of the people throughout the country, our country has achieved great successes in all aspects. Convening the National People's Congress and formulating a constitution on this basis is completely correct, timely, and in line with the demands of the people throughout the country." Pan Dakui, Chairman of the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic League, said: "The Chinese people began striving for democratic constitutionalism in the late Qing Dynasty. For half a century, they have been deceived and suffered countless sacrifices, without ever seeing a people's constitution. Now, only three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are going to hold a general election and formulate a constitution. This is the result of the people's victory under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." Everyone unanimously expressed that they would earnestly strengthen propaganda work among the people and strive together with practical actions to complete the great task of convening the National People's Congress.
    Yuan Xuezhi, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The convening of the National and local people's congresses at all levels is a great encouragement to the workers of Hunan Province, who are participating in large-scale economic construction. The workers of the province guarantee to do a good job in production and prepare for the general election to welcome this great event." Zhou Huaxiang, a student at Changsha No. 3 Middle School, said: "In the era of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, secret agents persecuted progressive students everywhere. There was no talk of democracy or freedom. Today, the people are truly masters of their own country. For the prosperity of the motherland, I must study hard to welcome the convening of the National People's Congress." Xiang De, Chairman of the Changsha Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and Manager of the New China Machinery Factory, said: "Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party have we obtained democratic political life and the prosperity of industry and commerce. We industrialists and businessmen in Changsha will definitely guarantee the successful completion of the general election."
    Ma Hongbin (Hui nationality), Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government and Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, said: "The convening of the People's Congress will further strengthen the unity among all nationalities." Zhang Quancai (Tibetan nationality), a member of the Consultative Committee of the Gansu Provincial People's Representatives Conference, used the achievements of the Tianzhu Autonomous Region in various fields over the past three years to illustrate the superiority of the people's democratic system. He said: "The convening of the People's Congress will further unleash the enthusiasm of the minority nationalities in the large-scale economic construction of the motherland." More than 280 students from Northwest Middle School (a Hui school) in Lanzhou held a symposium to study and discuss the resolution passed by the Central People's Government Committee. They decided to publicize the work related to the convening of the People's Congress to the citizens during the upcoming winter vacation.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: Local organizations of various democratic parties and consultative committees of various provinces (cities) have sent telegrams to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government, endorsing the convening of the National and local people's congresses at all levels.
    In a telegram to the Central People's Government, the democratic parties in the Southwest Region and Chongqing said: "The convening of the general election of the People's Congress is an unprecedented major event in Chinese history. The Chinese people, after half a century of struggle, fully understand that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the people's revolution and the overthrow of the reactionary rule, can the National People's Congress be convened and a truly democratic constitution be formulated. All members of our democratic parties in the Southwest resolutely guarantee to take active action, to strive for the final victory in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, to complete the national economic construction plan, and to welcome this democratic election movement together with the people of the whole country, and to work hard to implement the People's Congress system."
    The Guangdong and Guangzhou Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committees and local organizations of various democratic parties in South China jointly sent a telegram to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government Committee, saying:
    "The convening of the National and local people's congresses at all levels will further strengthen the great revolutionary unity of all nationalities, all democratic classes, and all democratic parties in our country. The enthusiasm of the people throughout the country will be better unleashed, so that our national construction work can proceed smoothly and achieve great victories. All our members resolutely guarantee to contribute our strength together with the people throughout the country to prepare for the convening of the People's Congress and to actively participate in the large-scale economic and cultural construction of the country."
    In a telegram to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the democratic parties in Wuhan said: "In the past three years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has victoriously completed a series of social reform movements, fundamentally consolidating the central and local people's democratic power. The resolution on the convening of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels recently passed by the Central People's Government Committee is timely, completely correct, and in line with the demands of the people throughout the country. We warmly endorse this decision and guarantee to actively participate in and promote the preparatory work for the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and under the leadership of our central organizations."
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 17th: Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabar, head of the Tibetan delegation currently visiting Lanzhou, on behalf of all members of the delegation, made a statement to reporters of this agency, warmly endorsing the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee on the convening of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels.
    Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabar said: We were so happy to hear this news in the northwest of our motherland. I believe that the Tibetan people will feel as happy as we do when they hear this news. In the past, our Tibetan people were oppressed by the great-Han chauvinism of the Manchu Qing and the reactionary Kuomintang, and we could not even talk about the right to participate in national affairs. Today, we Tibetan people enjoy the same rights of freedom and equality as all the fraternal nationalities in the country, and we deeply feel the infinite warmth of the national family. Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabar cited many examples they saw during their visits throughout the country, illustrating that the unity and political consciousness of the people of all nationalities have been unprecedentedly enhanced, and that the conditions for convening the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels are indeed fully met. He said: Tibet has lagged behind fraternal national regions in various construction undertakings due to the long-term oppression and exploitation of imperialist aggressive forces. However, we have full confidence that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and with the fraternal assistance of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet to consolidate national defense and the people of all nationalities throughout the country, our Tibetan people must further unite with the people of all nationalities throughout the country, victoriously complete the work of the People's Congress, further promote people's democracy, further strengthen national construction, and strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and jointly build our motherland into an incomparably powerful country, and build Tibet into a prosperous and affluent new Tibet.
