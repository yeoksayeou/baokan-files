    Learning from the Example of Soviet Farmers, Supporting National Industrialization
    —Record of the Beliefs of Members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Luo Yingmin
    On a road in Jiaohe County, I came across a series of rubber-wheeled carts loaded with firewood and grain, heading towards Baotun Village. These were farmers from Xinli Village sending their surplus grain and straw from 1952 to Baotun Village as shares for joining the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative. The crops of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative suffered hail damage in 1952, but were not "beaten down." The power of the collective overcame the natural disaster. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations of all 25 households in the cooperative amounted to more than 406,000 catties of grain, and the income of the members was generally 50 to 80 percent higher than that of individual farmers. This encouraged the members' confidence in moving forward and illuminated the path forward for the surrounding farmers. After Han En returned from the Soviet Union, he told everyone about what he had seen in the Soviet Union, and everyone became even clearer about the bright and happy future. Fifteen farmers in Xinli Village repeatedly requested to join the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baotun Village, and the cooperative approved their request.
    There was an old man in Xinli Village named Zhang Fu. In the past, when someone told him how good collective farms were, he would say, "Who has seen it? No matter how good it is, isn't it the same amount of work?" This time, after listening to Han En's talk, he also said to everyone he met, "The Soviet collective farms are good!" He said, "Collective farms also require work, but with machines, the work is very different!" In the past, when someone tried to persuade him to join the agricultural production cooperative, he said "no" eight times in a row, but this time he automatically requested to buy shares. Wang Zhonghe from Xinli Village used to be afraid of "joining the big pile" in the future, and his production had not been active for several years. This time, after listening to Han En's talk about the situation in the Soviet Union, he went 50 li away overnight to bring back a horse he had hidden at a relative's house to join the cooperative. Chi Dianwu, a member of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baotun Village, used to be afraid of having his property divided equally when collective farms were established, and always thought that after settling accounts in the autumn of 1952, he would not work in the cooperative anymore. After listening to Han En's words, he no longer wanted to work alone. He calculated his own accounts and immediately mobilized his daughter-in-law, Li Wenlian, who had never worked in the fields, to join the cooperative; the whole family expressed their determination to go to the collective farm with the entire cooperative.
    Han En was very excited when he talked to me about the changes in the thinking and actions of the people in the village after he returned from the Soviet Union. He said: Seeing such high enthusiasm among the masses, I have also been further educated. If it were not for the leadership of the working class, the peasants would not know what path they would have taken. Many facts I saw in the Soviet Union also clearly show that the happy life of farmers is inseparable from the industrialization of the country.
    Han En said: We visited an "unmanned factory" in the Soviet Union, which was completely automated. Only a few people sat in front of the electrical equipment that managed the machines, controlling the buttons. Raw materials kept jumping from one machine to another, and finally they were assembled into machines. We also saw a very large transfer machine that sent aluminum blocks to the furnace to be melted into aluminum water, and then automatically poured them out to cast piston blanks for engines in cars and tractors. The blanks were drilled, turned, and polished on automatic machines in sequence, and soon became pistons. A car factory could produce a car in six minutes; a tractor factory could produce a tractor in seven minutes. It was the machines and cars made by the working class that brought happiness to the Soviet farmers. The more developed and advanced the industry, the happier and more joyful the workers and peasants will be. We also visited the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal in the Soviet Union. One dam on the canal was dozens of feet high. There were very large locks that could make the river flow backwards and make ships climb mountains. This not only facilitated transportation and reduced transportation costs, but also provided irrigation and power generation. The water diversion irrigation system of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal could make all the land in the Rostov Oblast and the Stalingrad Oblast free from drought and have a bumper harvest every year. Soviet friends told us that the grain on this land could be increased nine times, and the production of fruits, cattle, and sheep could be increased three times. The electricity generated by the hydropower station is supplied to factories and cities, as well as to collective farms. With electricity, the life of the farm has changed greatly: tractors use electricity, "threshing" uses electricity, watering the land uses electricity, feeding livestock (chopping grass, supplying water) uses electricity, milking cows uses electricity, and there are also electric lights, movies, radio broadcasts, electric irons, electric flour mills, electric oil presses, and so on. Electricity has taken on many heavy tasks and made the lives of farmers brighter. This grand canal, this irrigation system, this electricity—all of them were created by the working class. If the Soviet state had not been industrialized, no one would have been able to do these things; even if they had been done, it would not have been the farmers' turn to benefit.
    Han En said: The Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union said in his report to us: "Soviet industry is not for making money, but for improving the material life of the people and reducing people's physical labor; industry supplies agriculture with machines and chemical fertilizers in order to enable agriculture to obtain more products." Han En said that from the actual situation in the Soviet Union, this is indeed the case. Soviet industry supplies agriculture with the latest machines every year; if the old machines are not easy to use, they are replaced with new ones. If double-wheeled tractors are not efficient enough, various tracked tractors are built. Soviet factories also continue to produce many new machines to replace more of the farmers' physical labor. Not only are machines used for plowing, harrowing, sowing, weeding, harvesting, and mowing, but machines are also used for planting tobacco, planting trees, picking cotton, applying fertilizer, digging radishes, shearing sheep, digging ditches, and repairing roads. The Stalin No. 80 tractor is really powerful! Using it to plow the soil with a plow can turn it three feet deep; using it to pull a harvester to cut wheat can harvest 30 hectares a day (including cutting and threshing). How can we not produce more grain! How can people not be energetic when they work!
    In the past, when old cooperative member Niu Defang heard about "the working class being the leading class," he would disapprovingly say, "No matter how good the industry is, if we don't farm the land, the workers won't have food to eat!" After listening to Han En's report, he understood that if industry does not develop, farmers will not eat well either. Female cooperative member Niu Guizhi used to say, "Workers make machines, we farm the land, what does it have to do with us?" Now, she says, "I understand now: we cannot have good clothes to wear or good things to use without the working class; in the future, as production develops and life improves, we will be even more inseparable from industry." Old cooperative member Gao Wenming said, "After listening to Han En's report and watching the movie 'Happy Life,' I really understood that if industry does not develop, if there are no tractors to 'pull' us forward, we will never be able to reach the collective farm."
    Han En said: I used to promote the wrong things to the villagers. At that time, I said, "Work hard, and in a few years we can buy a tractor." After visiting the Soviet Union, I realized that if industry develops, the state will give us machines to use. We cannot get many large machines on our own. Now our entire cooperative understands that without national industrialization, farmers would never be able to separate from the clumsy plow and cattle and horses. Without industry, not to mention using tractors, even new-style farm implements cannot be used. Our income increased in 1952, which is closely related to the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative and the use of new-style farm implements! Han En also said: We also had a wrong idea in the past. When new-style farm implements first came to our village, we were not familiar with the technology and always thought: Why doesn't the government send an expert to help us? After visiting the Soviet Union, we realized that technology should be learned by the farmers themselves. Most of the tractor drivers in the Soviet Union are members of the farm. They make parts and repair machines in the repair shop in winter, and drive machines to the fields to produce from spring to autumn. Farmers are also gradually becoming "workerized." Now we have decided to establish a technical team to train young men and women so that they can learn to master new-style farm implements and further train them to be tractor drivers in the future. Even the old men feel that they cannot do without learning. Old man Liang Naitang said, "If I don't even know the letters, how can I use machines to farm in the future?" He is sick, but he still asks his daughter at home to teach him to practice pinyin. With the promotion of the quick literacy method, most of the men and women in the village already know more than a thousand characters.
    One evening, Han En convened a meeting of cooperative members to formulate the cooperative's 1953 production and construction plan, discussing how to welcome the country's large-scale planned economic construction and how to support the industrial production front. Han En talked about the fact that our country will begin to implement the Five-Year Plan in 1953, and everyone was very excited. Female cooperative member Niu Guizhi said, "I have been looking forward to this day every day, and this day is coming soon! In a few years, we will definitely be able to build tractors. I must study hard, learn to use new-style farm implements now, and learn to drive tractors in the future."
    As a result of the discussion, it was decided to use these practical actions as a gift to the country's large-scale economic construction:
    1. Expand and consolidate the agricultural production cooperative, and organize the entire village within three years to create superior conditions for the transition to collective farms.
    2. Increase the yield per unit area and supply the country with more grain. Grain production should be increased by 10% in 1953. (The actual output in 1952 was about 400,000 catties, and it is planned to produce 440,000 catties in 1953.) Twenty-five hectares of the cooperative's 90 hectares of land should be increased by 100%.
    3. Conclude a combined contract with the supply and marketing cooperative. Combine agricultural production and industrial production through the supply and marketing cooperative.
    4. All young people in the cooperative guarantee to eliminate illiteracy and semi-illiteracy this year, learn agricultural technology, and train a labor reserve for factories.
    Liang Naitang, Niu Defang, and several other old men added one more item: Industry cannot develop without wood. In order to support industry, we must expand the forest nursery to four hectares. All members of the cooperative applauded their proposal.
    Han En also told everyone: Planting trees can also transform nature, prevent wind and drought. We must plant trees on mountain land and alkaline land within five years. In order to increase production, we must also build canals, open meadows, and dig ponds. In addition, we must also develop animal husbandry and produce more milk, meat, and eggs. He said: This is also supporting industry; these are also very much needed in factories.
    Everyone unanimously expressed that they must complete these plans and compete with the working-class elder brothers.
    The next morning, Chi Dianwen, deputy director of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative, pointed to the large meadow south of the village and said to me: "When the country is industrialized and agriculture is collectivized, and tractors come, this large area of wasteland will be turned over and become fertile land. The South Mountain will become a pasture, where large herds of cattle and sheep can graze. At that time, when industry develops, electrification will not be difficult."
    We looked at the open fields around us; this large piece of land became even more lovely in my eyes. With the victory of national industrialization, this will become a large farm with a bumper harvest of grains every year.

    学习苏联农民的榜样，支援国家工业化
    ——记韩恩农业生产合作社社员们的信念
    罗颖民
    在蛟河县的一条大路上，我碰到一辆一辆的胶轮车，载着柴草和粮食，赶向保安屯去。这是新立屯的农民把一九五二年的余粮和谷草送到保安屯去，作为加入韩恩农业生产合作社的股金。韩恩农业生产合作社的庄稼一九五二年遭了雹灾，但没有被“打伤”。集体的力量战胜了天然灾害。全社二十五户，农业副业总收入合计四十万六千多斤粮食，社员的收入比单干农民的收入一般要高百分之五十到八十。这鼓舞了社员们前进的信心，也照亮了周围农民们前进的道路。韩恩从苏联回来以后，把他在苏联见到的情形对大家一讲，大家更加看清了美满幸福的前途。新立屯有十五户农民，一再要求加入保安屯的韩恩农业生产合作社，合作社批准了他们的要求。
    新立屯有个老头叫张富，以前，有人向他说集体农庄怎么好，他就说：“谁看见了？再好，不是一样干活吗？”这回听了韩恩的谈话，他也见人就说“苏联的集体农庄好”了，他说：“集体农庄是也要干活，可是使上了机器，干活可就大不相同了！”以前有人劝他加入农业生产合作社，他一连说八个“不”字，这次他却自动要求入股了。新立屯王中和以前老怕将来“归大堆”，几年来生产一直不积极，这次听了韩恩谈苏联的情形，连夜到五十里外把自己藏在亲戚家的一匹马也牵回来入到合作社里了。保安屯韩恩农业生产合作社的社员迟殿武，过去也老害怕到成立集体农庄时把财产平分了，总想一九五二年秋后算完帐，就不在合作社里干了。听了韩恩的话以后，再也不想单干了。他自己算了一下帐，马上动员他的一年也没下过地的儿媳妇李文莲参加了合作社；全家都表示一定要跟全社一同走到集体农庄去。
    韩恩和我谈着他从苏联回来以后屯子里的人们的思想上行动上的变化时，非常兴奋。他说：看到群众这样高的情绪，我也进一步受到了教育。要不是有工人阶级领导着，农民不知道会摸到什么道上去了。我在苏联看到的许多事实，也清楚地说明了，农民的幸福生活，和国家的工业化是分不开的。
    韩恩说：我们在苏联参观了一个“无人工厂”，完全是自动化的，只有几个人坐在管理机器的电气装置前面，管着电钮。原料不停地从这个机器蹦到那个机器，最后就装配成了机器。我们还看到一个很大的转运机，把铝块送到熔炉里化成铝水，然后自动倒出来，铸成汽车和拖拉机上发动机里用的活塞坯子，坯子在自动的机器上按着次序钻孔、镟光、磨光，一会儿就成了活塞。一个汽车工厂，六分钟就能出一辆汽车；一个拖拉机工厂，七分钟就能出一架拖拉机。就是工人阶级造的这些机器和汽车，把幸福带给了苏联农民。工业越发达、越进步，工人和农民就都越幸福、越快乐。我们在苏联还参观了列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河。运河上的一条坝，有几十丈高。有很大很大的水闸，能叫河水倒流，能叫轮船爬山。这不但便利了交通，减低了运输成本，还能溉灌、发电。列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的引水灌溉系统，就能够使罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州两个州的全部土地不受旱灾，年年丰收。苏联朋友告诉我们，这块土地的谷物因此可以增产九倍，水果、牛、羊可以增产三倍。水电站发的电，供给工厂、城市用，也供给集体农庄用。有了电，农庄的生活就大大变了样：开拖拉机用电力、“打场”用电力、浇地用电力、喂牲口（铡草、供水）用电力、挤牛奶用电力，还有电灯、电影、无线电广播、电熨斗、电力磨面、电力榨油等等。电力把许多重劳动都担当起来了，把农民们的日子照得更亮堂了。这大运河，这灌溉系统，这电力，那一样都是工人阶级造出来的。要不是苏联国家工业化了，这些事情谁也做不到；就是做到了，也轮不到农民沾边。
    韩恩说：苏联农业部部长给我们做报告时说：“苏联的工业不是为了赚钱，而是为了提高人民的物质生活，为了减轻人们的体力劳动；工业把机器和化学肥料供给农业，是为了使农业得到更多的产品。”韩恩说，我从苏联的实际情况看，确实是这个样子。苏联工业年年把最新式的机器供给农业；老的机器不好使了，就给换了新的。双轮式拖拉机效力不够高，就给造出了各种履带式的拖拉机。苏联工厂还不断造出许多新机器，代替农民更多的体力劳动。不光犁地、耙地、播种、除草、收获、割草用机器，连栽烟、栽树、摘棉花、上粪、刨萝卜、剪羊毛、挖渠、修路也都用机器。斯大林八十号拖拉机的劲真大！用它带着犁翻土，能翻三尺深；用它拉收割机割麦子，一天能收三十垧（连割带打）。这怎么能不多打粮食！人们干起活来怎么能不带劲！
    过去，老社员牛德芳一听到讲“工人阶级是领导阶级”，就不服气地说：“不管它工业怎么样好，咱们不种地，工人也吃不上饭！”听了韩恩的报告，他明白了：要是工业不发展，农民的饭也吃不怎么好。女社员牛桂芝过去说：“工人造机器，我们种地，我们和他们有什么关系呢？”现在，她说：“我现在明白了：我们离开工人阶级就没有好布穿，就没有好东西用；到将来，生产越发展，生活越要提高，就越离不开工业了。”老社员郜文鸣说：“听了韩恩的报告，又看了‘幸福的生活’那个电影，我才算真明白了，要是工业不发展，没有拖拉机‘拖’着咱们走，咱们怎么也走不到集体农庄去。”
    韩恩说：我过去向老乡们宣传错了。那时我说：“你们好好劳动，过几年咱们好买个拖拉机。”到苏联参观后我才明白：工业发展了，国家就会给我们机器使。只靠自己的力量，是弄不来许多大机器用的。现在我们全社都明白：要是没有国家工业化，农民八辈子也不会和笨犁、和牛马分家。要是没有工业，别说拖拉机使不上，就是新式农具也使不上。一九五二年我们收入多了，和成立农业生产合作社有很大关系，也和使用新式农具分不开啊！韩恩还说：我们过去还有一个错误想法，当新式农具才来到我们屯子里的时候，我们不大熟悉技术，老是想：政府为什么不派一个专家来帮助我们呢？到苏联参观以后才知道，技术应该是农民自己好好学才行。苏联的拖拉机手大部分就是农庄庄员。他们冬天在修理厂做零件，修机器，春天到秋天就开着机器下地生产。农民也渐渐“工人化”了。现在我们已经决定成立一个技术队，训练男女青年，让他们学会掌握新式农具，将来进一步培养他们当拖拉机手。连老头子们都觉得不学习不行了。老汉梁乃堂说：“连个字码都不认识，将来怎样能使机器种地呢？”他病着，还在家里要他姑娘教他练习拼音。推行了速成识字法，全村大部分男女都已经认识一千字以上了。
    在一个晚上，韩恩召开了一个制订一九五三年全社生产建设计划的社员大会，讨论怎样迎接国家大规模的有计划的经济建设，怎样支援工业生产战线。韩恩讲到一九五三年我们国家就要开始实行五年建设计划，大家非常兴奋。女社员牛桂芝说：“我天天盼着这一天，这一天可快要来了！再过几年，我们一定能造出拖拉机来。我一定要好好学习，现在学会用新式农具，将来学开拖拉机。”
    大家讨论的结果，决定用这些实际行动作为给国家大规模经济建设的献礼：
    一、扩大和巩固农业生产合作社，三年以内把全村都组织进来，为转变到集体农庄创造优越的条件。
    二、提高单位面积产量，供给国家更多的粮食。一九五三年粮食要增产一成。（一九五二年实产量约为四十万斤，一九五三年要产四十四万斤。）全社九十垧地中，有二十五垧地要增产一倍。
    三、和供销合作社订结合合同。通过供销合作社把农业生产和工业生产结合起来。
    四、全社青年保证在今年消灭文盲、半文盲，要学习农业技术，并为工厂培养劳动后备军。
    梁乃堂、牛德芳等几个老头又补充了一条：工业要发展，离不开木材。为了支援工业，我们要把育林苗圃扩大为四垧。全社社员都鼓掌响应他俩的建议。
    韩恩又告诉大家：植树还能改造自然、防风防旱。我们要在五年以内把山地、碱地都种上树。为了增产，还要修水渠、开草甸子、挖池塘。此外，还要发展牧畜业，多出牛奶、肉、鸡蛋。他说：这也是支持工业；这些也是工厂里很需要的。
    大家一致表示，一定要完成这些计划，和工人老大哥进行竞赛。
    第二天上午，韩恩农业生产合作社副主任迟殿文指着屯子南边的大草甸子对我说：“等国家工业化了，农业集体化了，来了拖拉机，这一大片荒地，都要翻过身来，变成肥地。南山做牧畜场，能放牧大群大群的牛羊。那时，工业发展了，要电气化也不难。”
    我们望着四周的开阔的原野；这一大片土地，在我眼里变得更加可爱了。随着国家的工业化的胜利，这里将成为年年五谷丰收的大农庄。
