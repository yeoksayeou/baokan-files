Xinhua News Agency, New York, 31st Dispatch: The year 1952 brought huge excess profits to American monopoly capitalists, while making the American people, especially the working class, even poorer.

    The "Wall Street Journal" said that the 727 largest American companies earned the highest profits in American history in the first nine months of 1952, exceeding the profits earned in the same period of 1951 by 5.2 percent. The profits earned by aircraft factories even exceeded 96.7 percent.

    On the other hand, real wages were further reduced in 1952. According to a bulletin published by the American Labor Research Association, as long as the increase in taxes and the rise in prices of food and consumer goods are taken into account, the real wages of American workers in 1952 were on average $148 lower than in 1949. This figure does not include the increase in rent, medical expenses, education expenses, etc. The bulletin said that due to tax increases and price increases since 1950, an average working-class family now falls short by $422 a year to pay for the minimum living expenses said by the US government. Unskilled workers' families have even less income, and the mothers in the families of blacks and other ethnic minorities often struggle to earn a loaf of bread.

    According to the reduced official figures of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the reduction in the consumption of various foods by workers in 1952 compared with the consumption in 1946 is as follows: milk reduced by 5.3 percent, butter by 13.9 percent, vegetables by 7.4 percent, and flour by 14.7 percent.

    The American working people are being forced into debt. "Business Week" pointed out that by the end of this year, the debts owed by the American people will reach 23 billion US dollars. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said that in 1952, more than 10 million American families owed doctors' consultation fees.

    The American monopoly capitalists' attack on the workers' living standards and workers' rights has sharpened the class struggle. The American strike movement and other events fully prove this point. A bulletin from the Department of Labor stated that in 1951, a total of 3,910 strikes occurred in the United States, resulting in a loss of 17.5 million workdays; in the first nine months of 1952, a total of 4,075 strikes occurred, resulting in a loss of 48.5 million workdays.

    American workers are welcoming 1953 with great anxiety about their future. Even the reactionary chairman of the American Federation of Labor, Meany, warned in his New Year's message that in order to prevent a large-scale economic depression and a huge increase in the number of unemployed, certain measures should be taken immediately to prevent it.

    一九五二年的美国
    劳动人民更贫困资本家利润更高
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：一九五二年给美国垄断资本家带来了巨大的超额利润，同时使美国人民，首先是工人阶级，更为贫困。
    “华尔街日报”说，七百二十七家最大的美国公司在一九五二年头九个月中获得了美国历史上最高额的利润，超过了一九五一年同期所获得的利润百分之五点二。各飞机厂所获得的利润更是超过百分之九十六点七。
    另一方面，在一九五二年内，实际工资却进一步减低了。据美国劳工研究协会发表的公报说，只要把赋税的增加和食物及消费品价格上涨这两个因素计算在内，一九五二年美国工人的实际工资就平均比一九四九年降低一百四十八美元。这个数字还没有把房租，医药费，教育费等的上涨计算在内。该公报说，由于一九五○年开始的增税与物价上涨，一个普通工人家庭现在为了支付美国政府说的最低限度需要的生活费用，平均一年也短少四百二十二美元。非熟练工人的家庭的收入更少，黑人和其他少数民族的代表们的家庭中的母亲们经常为谋取一块面包而挣扎。
    根据美国劳工统计局缩小了的官方数字，一九五二年工人们的各种食物消费量比一九四六年的消费量减少的情况如下：牛奶减少百分之五点三，牛油百分之十三点九，蔬菜百分之七点四，面粉百分之十四点七。
    美国劳动人民正被迫负债。“商业周刊”指出，到今年年底，美国人民所负的债务将达二百三十亿元。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，在一九五二年内，有一千万以上的美国家庭欠医生的诊疗费。
    美国垄断资本家对工人的生活水准与工人权利的进攻使阶级斗争更形尖锐化。美国的罢工运动与其他事件就充分地证明了这一点。劳工部的公报说，一九五一年，美国共发生了三千九百一十次罢工，共损失一千七百五十万个工作日；一九五二年的头九个月中共发生了四千零七十五次罢工，共损失四千八百五十万个工作日。
    美国工人正抱着对他们的前途十分担忧的心情来迎接一九五三年。甚至美国劳工联合会的反动的主席米尼，在他的新年祝辞中也提出警告说，为了防止大规模的经济萧条与失业人数的巨大增加，应该立即采取某些措施来加以防范。
