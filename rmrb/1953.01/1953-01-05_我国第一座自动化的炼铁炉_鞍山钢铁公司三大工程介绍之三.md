China's First Automated Blast Furnace
--Introduction to the Three Major Projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company (3)
Ai Zhi, Chang Gong

The renovation of the No. 8 blast furnace at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works was one of the three major projects undertaken in Anshan in 1952. The main purpose of the renovation project was to revive the No. 8 blast furnace, which had been out of production since 1949, and to transform the blast furnace into China's first automated blast furnace without making major changes to its structure and auxiliary equipment. In the future, the production volume of this blast furnace will greatly exceed the highest level during the enemy and puppet regime. This renovation project will also provide successful experience for the renovation of other blast furnaces in China in the future.

The renovation of the No. 8 blast furnace involved a series of changes in factories and mines: In order to supply power and raw materials to the No. 8 blast furnace, the ore dressing plant had already repaired the third ore dressing site; the thermal power plant renovated two steam boilers and installed a blower with a blowing capacity of 2,000 cubic meters per minute; the Ministry of Chemical Industry also repaired two coking furnaces with an annual output of 400,000 tons of coke, as well as a recovery plant that uses blast furnace gas and coal gas discharged daily from the coking furnace to produce various chemical products… These dozens of large and small projects, connected to the No. 8 blast furnace project, are called the No. 8 blast furnace system project. The No. 8 blast furnace project is the main project in this system project, and it is large in scale and technically complex. It needs to modify and add more than 2,000 types of parts, totaling more than 730 tons. In addition, it also needs thousands of tons of refractory bricks, thousands of tons of metal structural products, 980 tons of mechanical equipment, more than 11,000 meters of cable pipes, 20 communication equipment platforms, and 16 motors. These materials and equipment, plus other accessories, weigh more than 10,000 tons. After the renovation, when it starts production, this blast furnace will need to consume 4,000 tons of ore, coke, and flux, as well as more than 3 million cubic meters of air every day.

The No. 8 blast furnace is equipped according to Soviet advanced designs and with the latest Soviet-made equipment and instruments. When it starts production, automated operation will completely replace strenuous labor. For example, in the past, weighing, hooking, opening the hoist, and opening the large and small covers of the furnace top were inseparable from people, and people did not know whether the material was enough, so the amount of iron produced often varied. After the renovation, it will be completely different. When the automatic weighing car sends the raw materials to the side of the furnace, the hoist will automatically hook up and send the raw materials to the top of the furnace. At this time, the large and small covers on the furnace have automatically opened, swallowing a huge amount of raw materials. Then, two probes automatically enter the furnace to detect whether the raw materials are sufficient, and report the results to the duty personnel through instruments.

For example, when mastering the production process of the blast furnace, most of it used to rely on experience. Workers often wear colored glasses, climb here to take a look, and climb to another place to take a look, busy all day long, but still cannot grasp the situation in the furnace, resulting in many accidents and affecting normal production. After the renovation, this has completely changed. As long as the duty personnel sit in the instrument control room, they can know everything in the furnace without going out. Because after the renovation, it does not rely on experience, but on automatic instruments to master. The amount of material in the furnace, the size of the wind temperature, the time of tapping, etc., all have signals to regularly report to the duty personnel, or automatically record them.

Also, in terms of tapping iron and slag, in the past, opening and closing the tap hole were inseparable from people. What will be the situation in the future? When the furnace needs to tap iron, just press a button, and the opening machine will automatically go to open the tap hole. After the iron is tapped, press the button again, and the mud gun will automatically seal the tap hole. Therefore, with these automated equipment, the renovated No. 8 blast furnace is like a living person, knows cold and heat, and also knows hunger and fullness, and of course knows how to work better.

According to the current situation, the No. 8 blast furnace and its system project have basically been completed. The No. 8 blast furnace is only waiting for a few complete sets of equipment to be put into production soon. Among the auxiliary projects, the two steam boilers of the thermal power plant have long been repaired; the new blower has also been installed and is being test-run. The furnace bodies of the two coking furnaces of the chemical plant have been dried. The recovery plant, etc. in the blast furnace system project have also been completed one after another according to the predetermined plan, and are undergoing final inspection, and will be put into production soon. From these situations, the progress of this project is also very fast. Although our engineering and technical strength is still very weak, the fact of this project, like other huge and complex projects, once again proves to us a truth: with the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, with the people who love the motherland and love labor, plus the Soviet Union's help to us, all difficulties can be overcome, and our motherland is rapidly moving towards a bright future of industrialization.

    我国第一座自动化的炼铁炉
    ——鞍山钢铁公司三大工程介绍之三
    爱芝  常工
    改建鞍钢炼铁厂第八号高炉，是鞍山一九五二年进行的三大工程之一。改建工程的主要目的，是要把从“九三”以来即已停止生产的八号高炉复活，并在结构与附属设备不大变动的条件下，把高炉改建成为我国的第一座自动化的高炉。将来，这座高炉的生产量，将大大超过敌伪时期最高水平。这一改建工程，也将为今后我国改建其他高炉取得成功的经验。
    改建八号高炉的工程，牵联到一系列厂矿的改变：为了供应八号高炉的动力和原料，选矿厂早已把第三选矿场修复了；火力发电厂改修了两座蒸气锅炉，安装了每分钟鼓风二千立方公尺的鼓风机；化工部也修复了年产焦炭四十万吨的两座炼焦炉，以及利用高炉瓦斯和炼焦炉每日排出的煤气制作各种化学产品的回收厂……，这些大小数十件工程，和八号高炉工程连在一起，人们便把它们称为八号高炉系统工程。八号高炉工程是这个系统工程中的主要工程，它的规模宏大，技术复杂。它要改添的部件有两千多种，共七百三十余吨。另外，它还需要用数千吨耐火砖、上千吨的金属结构品、九百八十吨机械设备、一万一千余公尺电缆管道、二十座通讯设备台和十六台马达。这些物资、器材，再加上其它附属品，共重万余吨。而改建以后，当它开始生产时，这座高炉每天需要吞食四千吨矿石、焦炭和熔剂以及三百余万立方公尺空气。
    八号高炉是按照苏联的先进设计和用苏联制造的最新式的设备与计器装备的，它开始生产时，自动化的操作将完全代替费力的劳动。例如，过去过称、挂钩、开卷扬机、打开炉顶的大盖和小盖，都离不开人，而且，装的料够不够，人还不知道，以致出铁的数量常有差别。改建以后，就完全不一样了。当自动称量车把原料送到炉旁，卷扬机就自动挂钩，把原料送上炉顶。这时，炉上的大盖和小盖已自动打开，吞食着巨量的原料，随后，两根探尺自动地走进炉内去探测原料是否足够了，并将结果经过计器向值班人员报告。
    又如掌握高炉生产过程时，过去大部分都靠经验。工人们经常戴着有色眼镜，一会爬在这儿看看，一会又爬到另一个地方看看，整天忙忙碌碌，仍然不能掌握炉内情况，以致事故很多，影响正常生产。改建以后，这也完全改变了，只要值班人员坐在计器操纵室内，不用出门，就可以知道炉内的一切情况。因为改建以后，不是靠经验，而是靠自动计器来掌握。炉内的料多料少、风温的大小、出铁的时间等等，都有信号向值班人员经常报告，或自动地记录下来。
    还有，在出铁出渣方面，过去开口、塞口，都离不开人。今后又将是怎样的情况呢？炉子要出铁，只要按一下电纽，开口机便自动地前去开口。铁出完后，再按一下电纽，泥沦机就自动地把口封上。因此，改建后的八号高炉，有了这些自动化的设备，它就像一个活人一样，知道冷热，也知道饥饱，当然也就更知道工作了。
    根据目前的情况来看，八号高炉和它的系统工程，基本上已算完成了，八号高炉只等待几项设备齐全了就能很快开始生产。辅助工程中，火力发电厂的两个蒸气锅炉，早已修复完毕；新式的鼓风机也已安装停当，都正在试行运转。化工厂的两座炼焦炉，炉身已经烘干，高炉系统工程中的回收厂等，也都按照预定计划先后完成，正进行最后的检验，不久就可以开始生产。从这些情况来看，这个工程的进度也是很快的。尽管我们的工程技术力量还十分薄弱，但是这一工程的事实，也像其它巨大复杂的工程一样，再度向我们证明了一个真理：我们有着共产党和人民政府的领导，有着热爱祖国和热爱劳动的人民，再加上苏联对我们的帮助，一切困难是可以战胜的，我们的祖国正迅速地走向美好的工业化的前途。（附图片）
