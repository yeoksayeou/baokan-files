The Northwest Industrial Department Strengthens Basic Construction Organizations and Cultivates Talent

[This Newspaper News] Various professional bureaus under the Northwest Industrial Department are actively strengthening basic construction organizations and cultivating technical cadres and skilled workers.

The various professional bureaus under the Northwest Industrial Department have respectively established specialized organizational structures to undertake this year's basic construction tasks. The Northwest Industrial Department's Electricity Administration has established a preparatory office for new factories, and also established the Northwest Thermal Power Engineering Company and the preparatory office for power transmission and transformer projects, specifically responsible for the installation of power generation equipment and the construction of power transmission and transformer projects. The bureau also plans to establish a civil engineering construction organization to undertake large-scale construction tasks. The main task of coal industry basic construction in the Northwest this year is to carry out drilling work. The preparatory office of the Northwest Industrial Department's Coal Mine Administration has established a drilling team and has made preliminary plans for geological survey, drilling, and material supply this year. New factory preparatory organizations and drilling teams in the machinery field have also been established, and drilling machines and various necessary instruments are basically complete, and geological surveys of new factory sites will begin soon. The Northwest Industrial Department's Textile Administration has also established preparatory organizations for new factories.

In addition to transferring capable cadres to strengthen the leadership of basic construction, the professional bureaus of the Northwest Industrial Department are carrying out a large amount of work to train technical cadres and skilled workers. The preparatory office of the Northwest Industrial Department's Coal Mine Administration will focus on training technical workers in the first half of this year. Combining labor employment work, the preparatory office has recruited a large number of unemployed workers and young students, and after a short period of political study, they have been sent to North China and Southwest China to study technology. A group of automobile drivers have been recruited to be trained as diesel engine workers. In addition, training classes for drilling workers have also been organized. The coal mine workers' school is also actively being prepared. This school will not only prepare talents for large-scale drilling work, but also cultivate talents for the construction of new mines. In order to meet the needs of the development of the machinery industry in the Northwest, the preparatory office of the Northwest Industrial Department's Machine Industry Bureau has taken over a mechanical workers' school and established a machine industry manufacturing school to train skilled workers and technicians. The two schools have a total of more than 1,000 students. Another technical school is in the process of selecting a site. In addition, the preparatory office of the industrial bureau has decided to promote active members from workers in existing factories to serve as deputies. Recently, five technicians and five cadres have been drawn from the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Machine Factory to work in the new factory construction unit.

In order to facilitate the learning of the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union and the construction experience of various parts of the country, all cadres of the preparatory office of the Northwest Industrial Department's Machine Industry Bureau spend half a day each week learning Russian, and also conduct reviews in their spare time at night. The Northwest Industrial Department's Electricity Administration has recruited dozens of young students and sent them to Northeast China to study. The Northwest Industrial Department's Textile Administration has also recruited hundreds of business personnel in East China and North China, and will soon establish training classes for statistics, accounting, original records, and planning, preparing to equip basic construction units. The bureau also drew a group of employees from the bureau and the state-owned Northwest No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory and other places to Qingdao to learn technology; other textile factories are also cultivating workers for new factories.

    西北工业部加强基本建设机构和培养人材
    【本报讯】西北工业部所属各专业局积极加强基本建设机构和培养技术干部与技工。
    西北工业部所属各专业局分别成立了承担今年基本建设任务的专业组织机构。西北工业部电业管理局成立了新建工厂的筹建处，并成立了西北火电工程公司和送电、变电工程筹建处，专门负责发电设备安装工程和送电、变电工程的施工。该局还计划成立土木建筑工程机构，承担大规模的建筑任务。西北今年煤业方面基本建设的主要任务是进行钻探工作，西北工业部煤矿管理局筹备处已成立了钻探队，初步作出了今年地质勘察、钻探、物资供应等计划。机械方面的新厂筹建机构和钻探队也已成立，钻探机及各种需用仪器已基本齐备，即将开始新厂址的地质勘察工作。西北工业部纺织管理局也成立了新厂的筹建机构。
    西北工业部各专业局除抽调得力干部加强基本建设的领导外，正进行大量培养技术干部和技工的工作。西北工业部煤矿管理局筹备处今年上半年以培养技术工人为主要任务。该筹备处结合劳动就业工作，招收了大批失业工人和青年学生，经过短期的政治学习后，已分送华北及西南等地学习技术；招收了一批汽车司机，准备培养成开柴油机的工人；另外还举办了培养钻探工人的训练班。煤矿工人学校也正积极筹备中，这个学校不仅要为大规模钻探工作准备人材，并要为新井的建设工程培养人材。为适应西北机器工业发展的需要，西北工业部机器工业局筹备处已接办了一个机械工人学校并成立了一个机器工业制造学校，培养技术工人和技术员。两校共有一千多名学员。另一个技工学校，正在选择校址。此外，该工业局筹备处并决定在现有工厂中从工人中提拔积极分子担任副职，最近已在国营西北第一机器厂抽出技术人员五人，干部五人到新厂筹建单位工作。
    为便于学习苏联先进的建设经验和国内各地的建设经验，西北工业部机器工业局筹备处全体干部每周以半天的时间学习俄文，另外还在夜间业余时间进行复习。西北工业部电业管理局招收了数十名青年学生派到东北学习。西北工业部纺织管理局也在华东、华北招考数百名业务工作人员，即将成立统计、会计、原始记录、计划等训练班，准备配备到基本建设单位去。该局并在局里和国营西北第四棉纺织厂等处抽调了一批职工派赴青岛学习技术；其他各纺织厂也正在为新厂培养工人。
