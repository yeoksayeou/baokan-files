Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: The Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), lasting eleven days, victoriously concluded on the 19th. This session summarized the work of the RCCK over the past two years, determined the direction of coordinating with and implementing the three major central tasks of the state this year, further clarified the nature and tasks of the RCCK, and laid a good foundation for future work.

The meeting listened to the work report of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee. After repeated discussions in plenary and small group meetings, the content of the report was unanimously approved. The meeting held that in the two years since the Second Plenary Session in November 1950, the RCCK had participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign and various social reform movements alongside the people of the whole country, gained experience, and strengthened its organization. The number of party members had increased two and a half times compared to two years ago, and a number of bad elements had been purged, and ideological remolding education had been carried out within the RCCK. The meeting pointed out that these achievements were mainly due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the implementation of the correct policies of the RCCK Central Committee by the entire party. The meeting also reviewed the shortcomings that still existed in the work of the past two years and put forward directions for improvement.

The meeting pointed out that the three major central tasks of the state this year are the political tasks of the entire RCCK. In the future, it should mobilize, educate, and organize all party members and the masses they connect with to fight for their thorough completion. First, political and ideological education combining Resist America, Aid Korea, patriotism, and internationalism should be carried out more universally and deeply among RCCK members and the masses they connect with. The tasks stipulated by the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch should be earnestly implemented. Second, in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's instruction to "take Russia as a teacher" and Chairman Mao's "lean to one side" policy, RCCK members and the masses they connect with should be called upon to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, concentrate wisdom, tap potential, actively participate in the state's large-scale construction work, and ensure the good performance of their jobs. Third, RCCK members and the masses they connect with should be mobilized to study documents related to democratic nation-building and prepare to welcome the convening of the National People's Congress and people's congresses at all levels.

Regarding the nature, tasks, and organizational work guidelines of the RCCK, the meeting held that the RCCK is a member of the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Its task in the division of labor in the united front is mainly to unite, educate, and transform former Kuomintang members and people who have historical connections with the Kuomintang. The meeting held that in order to strengthen the organization, it is necessary to implement the principle of "combining consolidation with development," strengthen New Democratic political and ideological education, and continue to strictly draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves.

The meeting pointed out that in order to do a good job in the three major tasks entrusted by the state, it is necessary to strive to carry out ideological education and ideological remolding. It is necessary to implement the Common Program as the unified standard for remolding the thinking of the entire party. Hostile thoughts that oppose the Common Program should be resolutely eliminated and not allowed to remain within the party. Erroneous thoughts with vague understanding should be criticized and corrected based on facts.

More than 40 people, including Xiong Kewu, Li Zhangda, Li Renren, Sun Weiru, Ning Wu, Cai Tingkai, and representatives of grassroots organizations from various regions, spoke at the meeting. They introduced the work experience of various regions and put forward many valuable suggestions for future work. They unanimously believed that the RCCK should play an active role in carrying out the three major tasks of the state. RCCK members should obey the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government in their respective work positions, study their professions diligently, transform their thinking, and strive to completely fulfill the state's great tasks.

During the meeting, all the attendees and observers participated in the study report meeting hosted by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, where they listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the international situation. They also participated in a tea party held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee.

The meeting closed on the afternoon of the 19th. At the closing meeting, everyone unanimously adopted the "Resolution of the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the Report of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee," and the "Resolution of the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the General Organizational Charter." They unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Song Qingling, the head of the Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress. At the meeting, Chairman Li Jishen proposed that the Presidium recommend that Central Committee member Zhu Xuefan fill the vacancy of Central Standing Committee member Guo Chuntao (deceased), which was unanimously approved.

Chairman Li Jishen delivered a closing speech. He called on all RCCK members to understand the spirit of the resolutions of the meeting, strictly draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, ensure the completion of the state's construction tasks, strictly abide by national discipline, and strengthen the inspection of party work and test party cadres during the national general election.
