They expressed their indignation at the crimes of those feudal remnants and counter-revolutionary elements in Linfen County and their intolerance of the bureaucracy of relevant authorities. They also requested information on the Party disciplinary actions against erring Party members and the administrative and legal punishments for other cadres and saboteurs/counter-attackers. This newspaper immediately forwarded the readers' opinions to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for a response. The following is that response.
