The phenomenon of indiscriminate recruitment of construction workers is extremely serious in Nanjing.
Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau Construction Units Disregard the Overall Situation and Illegally Recruit Workers

    In the preparatory work for capital construction, Nanjing City has discovered that certain enterprises, proceeding from departmentalism, are indiscriminately recruiting workers, disrupting the state's unified plan for labor allocation.
    There are four types of indiscriminate recruitment of capital construction workers: First, enterprises from other areas send people to Nanjing to recruit workers and use acquaintances to poach workers. For example, Xi'an Construction Company, State-owned Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, State-owned Anhui Machine Factory, East China Design Company, East China Military Region Construction General Factory, East China Installation Company, and other units have all used methods such as issuing travel expenses, settlement allowances, and guaranteeing no unemployment, to poach a number of technical workers through private relationships without going through organizational channels. In September of last year, Xi'an Construction Company poached more than sixty workers through an accountant from Nanjing. In December of last year, the Construction Committee of the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant allowed workers from Nanjing to recruit workers. The first batch recruited fourteen people without being discovered by the relevant departments in Nanjing City. The second batch recruited another twenty-nine people and were preparing to leave for Shanxi on December 29 when they were discovered by the Labor Allocation Group of the Nanjing City Capital Construction Office and were prevented from leaving.
    Second, state-owned enterprises in Nanjing City go to other areas to poach workers. For example, the Nanjing Electric Porcelain Factory of the East China Industrial Department lacked lathe operators and fitters, so it indiscriminately poached eight workers from Wuxi.
    Third, private enterprises in Nanjing City poach workers from state-owned enterprises. For example, Nanjing Private Junji Hydropower Company poached Ma Longxiang, an outside electrician from the Nanjing Electric Power Bureau of the East China Industrial Department, with high wages.
    Fourth, state-owned enterprises in Nanjing City poach workers from state-owned enterprises. For example, Factory 511, in order to establish a construction team, recruited technicians in Nanjing City through Xu Jitai (who had previously run a construction factory), openly advertising that anyone with skills, even those with unclear histories, would be accepted, except for the fixed workers of the state-owned construction company. As a result, the morale of some employed workers fluctuated, especially the temporary workers of the Nanjing City Construction Company who all wanted to go. For example, nearly a thousand workers from the Third Engineering Office of the Nanjing City Construction Company, who were building a certain secondary technical school and other projects, were preparing to take the test. After the Nanjing City Capital Construction Office Labor Allocation Group stopped Factory 511's unauthorized public recruitment of workers, it secretly used workers to poach workers, causing some employed workers to be unable to concentrate on their work. Four paint workers insisted on leaving the Nanjing City Construction Company to go to Factory 511; the Nanjing City Capital Construction Office Labor Allocation Group introduced bricklayer Yang Huowang to work at the construction company, but he refused to go and wanted to go to Factory 511. At present, this chaotic phenomenon of indiscriminate recruitment of workers is continuing to develop, making the unified organization and allocation of labor difficult, and some employed workers are not concentrating on their work. The aforementioned relevant leading departments should immediately effectively check and stop this illegal behavior stemming from departmentalism. Furthermore, the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau Housing Construction Committee and Construction Section illegally recruit capital construction workers without going through organizational procedures, hindering the work of other construction units in securing fixed long-term workers. On October 14th of last year, the Anhui Provincial Labor Bureau and the Bengbu Municipal People's Government announced the establishment of a unified allocation station for construction workers in Bengbu City, stipulating that all state-owned, private enterprises, and construction units must apply for hiring long-term and temporary construction workers, and be unifiedly called and allocated by the allocation station. However, in order to do a good job in its own construction, the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau did not notify the allocation station, the Municipal Labor Section, and the Construction Workers' Union, and carried out activities among the workers, promoting that their wages were higher than other units, they had holidays on Sundays, they had workers' dormitories to live in, and they implemented labor insurance regulations, etc. This caused the workers' morale to fluctuate, abandoning work in other construction units and entering the Railway Bureau. As of January 16th, the Housing Construction Committee had recruited sixteen carpenters and forty bricklayers. The Construction Section recruited eighteen carpenters and seventy bricklayers. The ongoing work of other construction units to secure fixed long-term workers has been greatly affected. This departmentalist approach of the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau is wrong, and the Ministry of Railways should stop it. (Qiu Jinyu)

    乱拉建筑工人的现象在南京极为严重
    蚌埠铁路分局建筑单位不顾整体违法招收工人
    在基本建设的准备工作中，南京市发现某些企业单位从本位主义出发，乱拉工人，破坏国家统一调配劳动力的计划。
    乱拉基本建设工人的情况有四种：一、外埠企业单位派人去南京招聘和利用熟人拉工人。如西安建筑公司、国营山西经纬纺织机械制造厂、国营安徽机器厂、华东设计公司、华东军区营建总厂、华东安装公司等单位，都曾以公家发路费、发安家费以及保证不失业等办法，不通过组织，利用私人关系拉去不少技术工人。西安建筑公司在去年九月间，通过该公司南京籍会计拉去六十多个工人。去年十二月，国营经纬纺织机械制造厂建厂委员会让该厂南京籍工人来招聘工人，第一批招去十四人，没有被南京市有关部门发觉；第二批又招了二十九人，准备在十二月二十九日动身去山西时，才被南京市基本建设办公室劳动调配组发现，没有去成。
    二、南京市国营企业到外埠去拉工人。如华东工业部南京电瓷厂缺乏车工和钳工，就到无锡去乱拉了八个工人。
    三、南京市的私营企业拉国营企业工人。如南京私营俊记水电行，曾以高额工资拉去华东工业部南京电业局外线电工马龙翔。
    四、南京市国营企业拉国营企业工人。如五一一工厂为了成立工程队，即通过该厂许基泰（过去曾经营过营造厂）在南京市内招聘技工，公开宣传除国营建筑公司的固定工人以外，只要有技术，甚至历史不清的也要，结果弄得部分在业工人思想波动，特别是南京市建筑公司的临时工人都想去。如南京市建筑公司第三工程处正在建筑某中等技术学校等工程的近千工人都准备去考。五一一工厂私自公开招聘工人的行为被南京市基本建设办公室劳动调配组阻止后，又秘密利用工人拉工人，弄得有些在业工人不能安心工作。曾有四个油漆工人硬吵着要离开南京市建筑公司去五一一厂；南京市基本建设办公室劳动调配组介绍瓦工杨火望去建筑公司工作，他不肯去，而要去五一一厂。目前，这种乱拉工人的紊乱现象还在继续发展，劳动力的统一组织和调配已感困难，部分在业工人不安心工作。上述各有关领导部门，应即有效地检查与制止这种从本位主义出发的违法行为。又讯：蚌埠铁路分局房屋建筑委员会及建筑段不通过组织手续，违法招收基本建设工人，妨碍其他建筑单位进行固定长期工人的工作。去年十月十四日，安徽省劳动局及蚌埠市人民政府公布成立了蚌埠市建筑工人统一调配站，规定各国营、私营企业及建筑单位雇用长年及临时的建筑工人必须申请，统一由调配站调用及分配。但蚌埠铁路分局为了搞好本单位的建设，未通知调配站、市劳动科及建筑工会就在工人中进行活动，宣传他们的工资比其他单位的高，星期有休假，有工人宿舍住，实行劳动保险条例等。这样便使工人思想波动，放弃其他建筑单位工作进入铁路局。到一月十六日止，房屋建筑委员会已招收了木工十六名，瓦工四十名。建筑段招收了木工十八名，瓦工七十名。其他建筑单位正在进行的固定长期工人的工作受到很大影响。蚌埠铁路分局这种本位主义的做法是错误的，铁道部应予以制止。　（邱金玉）
