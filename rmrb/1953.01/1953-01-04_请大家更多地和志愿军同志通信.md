Editor's Note: The letters of comfort from the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army have greatly encouraged them at the Korean front. The commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army cherish these letters. Many keep the letters of comfort close to them, reading them over and over again, and often use the love and expectations of the people of the motherland to encourage themselves. Similarly, the letters written back by the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army have also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the initiative in production and study of the people of the motherland. Therefore, we believe that Comrade Ji Guangzhong's suggestion is very good. We hope that the broad masses of readers can communicate more frequently with the Volunteer Army comrades and learn from the Volunteer Army. In particular, we hope that readers will write more letters to their relatives, friends, or fellow villagers in the Volunteer Army. In the past, many letters of comfort written by the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army were very vivid and specific. The writers, based on their own personal experiences, reported to the Volunteer Army the achievements of the motherland's construction, the new atmosphere of the motherland, or their own work, study, and life situations. These types of letters were most loved by the Volunteer Army comrades. However, some writers, although very enthusiastic, wrote many words of comfort and respect in their letters, but lacked other specific content, and therefore could not express their thoughts and feelings. Therefore, we hope that everyone will try to be as specific as possible when writing letters of comfort to the Volunteer Army. In addition, some domestic units have established fixed connections with certain units of the Volunteer Army in the past, communicating regularly and on time, reporting on work and combat situations, and some even proposing revolutionary competitions with each other. This approach is worthy of emulation.慰问信件，可以交由各地抗美援朝分会转寄朝鲜前线，用不着贴邮票。
    Please Communicate More with Volunteer Army Comrades
    Editor: The youth soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a movement to communicate with the youth of the motherland during the National Day in 1951. The leading organs of the unit called on each youth league branch to write a letter to the domestic youth workers, farmers or students. The Volunteer Army soldiers were eager to understand the achievements of the motherland on all fronts, so this call was enthusiastically responded to by the youth soldiers. At that time, the unit organized and sent more than 900 letters to domestic youth. Many youth league branches have organized to write letters to the youth of the motherland five or six times, and still maintain contact with the youth in some factories, rural areas or schools in China. In the letters, they each reported the specific situation of combat or production and study, expressed their determination, and made requests to each other, and were greatly encouraged by each other. The Youth League branch of a certain company also wrote its own merit-making plan in a letter to the domestic youth. The young soldiers said: Our merit-making plan has been sent back to the motherland, this is our guarantee to the motherland, and we will never fire blanks! Everyone is determined to use practical actions to strive for the realization of the merit-making plan. The young soldiers often said when they received the reply letters from the youth of the motherland: Seeing the great victory in the construction of the motherland, we feel infinitely happy even if we are more difficult in Korea. Similarly, the letters of the Volunteer Army's young soldiers have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of domestic youth for labor and study. A glass factory in Dalian framed the letter from the Youth League branch of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army and placed it on the blackboard newspaper for a long time for everyone to discuss, which promoted the factory's patriotic production increase and economy campaign. Gu Tonglin, a student at Nanyang Senior Vocational School in Henan, carried the letter from the Volunteer Army youth with him, and he said: "When I encounter difficulties, as long as I look at the examples of the heroic struggle of the Volunteer Army soldiers, I can increase my courage and strength." Many vivid examples have proved that organizing workers, peasants, students and Volunteer Army soldiers to communicate is one of the effective ways to carry out patriotic, internationalist and revolutionary heroism education, which is an experience worth promoting. Therefore, I suggest that trade unions, youth leagues, student unions and other organizations in factories, rural areas and schools in various places can appropriately and systematically promote this work. If labor models and learning models can be organized to communicate with Volunteer Army combat heroes and launch revolutionary competitions, it will have a greater role in promoting the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, the ideological transformation campaign, and the Volunteer Army soldiers' campaign to defend the motherland and defend peace by killing enemies and making meritorious service.

专栏：

    编者按：祖国人民写给志愿军的慰问信，在朝鲜前线起了很大的鼓舞作用。志愿军指战员们热爱这些信件，许多人把慰问信揣在身边读了再读，经常以祖国人民对他们的热爱和期望来勉励自己。同样地，志愿军指战员们写回来的信，也大大地鼓舞了祖国人民的爱国热情和生产、学习的积极性。因此，我们认为读者季光中同志的建议是很好的。我们希望广大读者能更多地和志愿军同志经常通信，向志愿军学习。尤其希望读者给在志愿军的亲友或同乡多写信。过去祖国人民写给志愿军的慰问信，有许多写得很生动具体。写信人根据自己的切身经验，向志愿军报告祖国建设的成绩，报告祖国的新气象，或者报告自己工作、学习和生活的情况，这种信最为志愿军同志所喜爱。但也有一些写信人虽然热情很高，在信里写了许多慰问、致敬的话，可是缺乏其他的具体内容，因此不能够把自己的思想感情表达出来。所以我们希望大家给志愿军写慰问信时尽量写得具体一些。另外，国内有一些单位过去和志愿军的一定部队建立了固定的联系，经常地、按期地通信，互相报告工作、战斗的情况，有的还互相提出革命的竞赛。这样作是值得大家仿效的。大家写的慰问信件，可以交由各地抗美援朝分会转寄朝鲜前线，用不着贴邮票。
    请大家更多地和志愿军同志通信
    编辑同志：中国人民志愿军某部的青年战士们在一九五一年国庆节时开展了一个和祖国青年通信的运动，该部领导机关号召每个青年团支部给国内青年工人、农民或学生写一封信。志愿军战士们都渴望着了解祖国在各个战线上的成就，因此这一号召得到青年战士的热烈响应，当时该部有组织地发给国内青年的信件就达九百余封。许多团支部有组织地与祖国青年写过五、六次信，至今仍与国内的某些工厂、农村或学校中的青年保持着书信联系。在信中，他们各自报告了战斗或生产、学习的具体情况，表达了自己的决心，并向对方提出要求，相互间得到很大鼓舞。某连青年团支部在给国内青年的信上还写着自己的立功计划。青年战士们说：我们的立功计划已经寄回祖国，这就是我们对祖国提出的保证，决不放空炮！大家都决心用实际行动来争取立功计划的实现。青年战士们接到祖国青年的复信时常说：看到祖国建设方面的伟大胜利，我们在朝鲜就是更艰苦一些也感到无限愉快。同样，志愿军青年战士的信也大大鼓舞了国内青年的劳动和学习的热情。大连有一个玻璃工厂把志愿军某单位的青年团支部的来信做上镜框，长期放在黑板报上，让大家讨论，推动了该厂的爱国增产节约运动。河南南阳高级职业学校同学顾同林把志愿军青年的来信随身带着，他说：“当我碰到困难时，只要看一看志愿军战士们英勇斗争的事例，就能给自己增加勇气和力量。”许多生动的事例证明了组织工人、农民、学生和志愿军战士通信是进行爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义教育的有效方式之一，这是一个值得推广的经验。因此，我建议各地工厂、农村、学校的工会、青年团、学生会等组织，能适当地有计划地来推行这一工作。如果能组织劳动模范、学习模范与志愿军战斗英雄通讯，挑起革命竞赛，对于爱国增产节约运动、思想改造运动，对于志愿军战士们保卫祖国、捍卫和平的杀敌立功运动都会有更大的推动作用。季光中
