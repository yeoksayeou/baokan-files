    China Coal Construction Company, Baoding Branch,
    Fails to Deliver Bricks According to Contract

    To the Editor: I am a staff member of the Materials Section of the Civil Engineering Construction Company of the Central Fuel Industry Department's Electricity Management Bureau. I am writing to expose the fact that the Baoding Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has failed to deliver goods according to the contract, causing serious losses to the state's basic construction projects.

    Our company signed a contract with the Baoding Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company on July 15 last year, approved by the Baoding Municipal People's Government, to purchase 10 million blue bricks. However, the bricks they delivered later did not meet the specifications and quality standards stipulated in the contract. When the bricks were first delivered at Liangxiang Railway Station, we noticed that the brick quality was poor and the specifications were inconsistent. At that time, due to the urgent need for the project, we had no choice but to accept them for use. Subsequently, the company delivered bricks again at Xizhimen Railway Station, and this batch of bricks was of even lower quality and more varied in specifications than those delivered in Liangxiang. Our company immediately notified them to quickly replace them with good bricks. The Coal Construction Company sent personnel to inspect and also admitted that the brick quality was poor and promised to replace them with good bricks, but the bricks delivered later were still substandard. Taking the more than 4 million bricks received at the Mining College construction site as an example, more than 80% of them were substandard bricks that were underfired, hollow, black, and uneven. Because of the poor brick quality, the construction site was afraid of affecting the lifespan of the buildings and was unwilling to use them. However, the project was progressing rapidly, and repurchasing good bricks would inevitably lead to work stoppages and waiting for materials. Therefore, under unavoidable circumstances, we reluctantly used more than 2 million bricks. During use, more than 580,000 of them broke. The more than 1.5 million bricks transported to the Electrical Industry School construction site were unusable due to their poor quality and were all stored at the site.

    The bricks delivered by the Baoding Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company did not meet the contract specifications and affected the progress of the project. We have repeatedly asked them to deal with it promptly, but they have always adopted a delaying attitude. Now that the blue bricks are stored at the construction site for a long time, they are prone to natural losses and are tying up state funds. The longer this drags on, the greater the losses to the state. I hope that the company will immediately correct this error. Meng Lian

### 中国煤建公司保定支公司  不按合同规定交砖

    中国煤建公司保定支公司
    不按合同规定交砖
    编辑同志：我是中央燃料工业部电业管理总局土木建筑公司材料科的工作人员。现在我来揭发中国煤业建筑器材公司保定支公司不按合同交货造成国家基本建设事业严重损失的事实。
    我公司于去年七月十五日经保定市人民政府核准，和中国煤业建筑器材公司保定支公司签订购买青砖一千万块的合同。但后来他们所交的砖，规格及质量均和合同规定标准不符。开始在良乡车站交砖时，我们已发觉砖质次、规格不一致。当时因工程需要紧急，只好勉强收下来使用。其后该公司又在西直门车站交砖，这批砖较在良乡交的质量更为低劣，规格更为参差不一。我公司即通知他们迅速改交好砖。煤建公司曾派员查验，也承认砖质次，并保证要改交好的砖，但是后来交的仍是次砖。拿矿业学院工地收的四百余万块砖来说，其中欠火的、空心的、黑的、不平的等次砖占百分之八十以上。因为砖的质量不好，工地怕影响建筑物寿命，不愿使用。但工程进度很快，重新购买好砖势将造成停工待料，所以在不得已的情况下勉强用了二百余万块。使用时其中即碎了五十八万余块。运至电气工业学校工地的一百五十余万块砖，因质量太坏不能使用，均存放在工地。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司保定支公司交的砖既与合同规定不符，影响工程进度，我们屡次要求他们迅速处理，但他们又始终采取拖延态度。现在青砖长久存放在工地，既容易造成自然损耗，又积压国家资金。这样拖的日子越长国家的损失就越大。我希望该公司立即纠正这种错误。　孟　廉
