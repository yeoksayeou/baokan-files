    The Facts of Lushan County Changed My Understanding of the Marriage Law

    Editor: After reading the vivid facts reported in the People's Daily on January 6, "How Lushan County, Henan Province, Implemented the Marriage Law," my understanding of the Marriage Law has changed. I used to think, "There are not many people who marry freely among the farmers; most of them do not know how to love." Now, the facts of Lushan County are before my eyes: farmers not only know how to love, but also the objects they choose are very good: they all love labor, love learning, love progress, and love serving the people. The new families they have established are very happy. Around me, it is easy to hear such words as: "Officials rely on seals, tigers rely on mountains, and women rely on men." "Ghosts and gods are not gods, and women are not people." Now, these absurd words are not worth refuting. As long as we act in accordance with the Marriage Law, women will not only be able to exert their labor power like men, but also work side by side with men to create greater happiness. After seeing the facts of Lushan County, everyone should shout: The Marriage Law is really good, and the happiness that Chairman Mao has brought us is endless. I suggest that relevant departments quickly make materials like those from Lushan County into movies or comic strips, etc., and go deep into the countryside and factories to publicize them, laying the foundation for the implementation of the Marriage Law.

### 鲁山县的事实改变了我对婚姻法的认识

    鲁山县的事实改变了我对婚姻法的认识
    编辑同志：我读了人民日报一月六日报道的“河南省鲁山县是怎样贯彻执行婚姻法的”活生生的事实后，使我改变了对婚姻法的认识。从前我想：“农民中自由结婚的人并没有几个；大多数都不会恋爱。”现在鲁山县的事实摆在我面前：农民不但会恋爱，而且他们所选择的对象都很好：都是爱劳动、爱学习、爱进步、爱为人民服务的。他们所建立的新家庭很幸福。在我的周围很容易听到这样的话：“官凭印，虎凭山，妇女凭的男子汉。”“鬼神不算神，女人不算人。”现在，这些荒唐话都不值得一驳了。只要按婚姻法办事，女人不仅能和男人一样发挥她们的劳动力，并且她们将和男人并肩为创造更大的幸福而努力。看了鲁山县的事实，任何人都应该高呼：婚姻法真是好，毛主席带给我们的幸福真是说不完。我建议有关部门快把鲁山县这一类的材料制成电影或连环画等，深入农村、工厂去宣传，为贯彻执行婚姻法打下基础。  王向光
