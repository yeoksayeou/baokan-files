    Qu Yaoli's Cotton Planting Method Has Stood the Test
    Ren Zhihao, Wu Gang
    In southern Shanxi, if you ask "Why was there a bumper cotton harvest last year?" every farmer will tell you: "We organized and learned from Qu Yaoli's advanced experience." Indeed, those who correctly learned Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience achieved higher yields than before. The average cotton harvest per mu in the Yuncheng area was 126 jin the year before last; although there were four types of disasters last year – floods, droughts, pests, and frost – the average cotton yield still increased to more than 150 jin per mu; more than 40 jin more than the average before the War of Resistance Against Japan.
        Tan Xiaoan's Story
    Farmers must go through many struggles to abandon old farming habits and accept advanced cotton planting techniques.
    Tan Xiaoan, a farmer in Longju Village, Jie County, has been a cart driver with Qu Yaoli for more than 20 years. However, in 1950, when Qu Yaoli created a new record of more than 700 jin of seed cotton per mu, Tan Xiaoan neither believed it nor was he convinced. He said: "I know all about Qu Yaoli's tricks! He doesn't have any amazing techniques. There's no trick to growing crops, just plenty of manure and saturated soil. I can get a bumper harvest by applying more manure." In 1951, he decided to compete with Qu Yaoli secretly, determined to surpass Qu Yaoli. Therefore, he desperately applied manure to his fields. To avoid being said to have achieved a bumper harvest just because of the excessive manure, he did it secretly. In the dead of night, when everyone was asleep, he quietly hitched up the cart and sent manure to the fields. He applied six large cartloads of stable manure, six dou of black beans, and 200 jin of sesame seed cake as base fertilizer to one mu of land. When the cotton grew to seven or eight fruiting branches, he secretly applied 40 jin of fertilizer powder as topdressing. In total, the fertilizer investment alone was 480,000 yuan per mu. Tan Xiaoan really expected his cotton to get a good harvest and surpass Qu Yaoli. His cotton plants did indeed grow taller than anyone else's. His neighbors said, "Xiaoan's cotton will need a ladder to pick the flowers!" Tan Xiaoan also boasted, "People can stand on my cotton stalks!" However, neglecting technology will never work. Tan Xiaoan's cotton only grew some tall stalks, but there were not many cotton bolls. Each mu yielded only about 500 jin of seed cotton, including frost-damaged flowers and cotton bolls that rotted due to excessive leaves blocking sunlight. This was not considered a very low yield in the local area. However, the quality of the cotton was too low to be sold to the supply and marketing cooperative. Tan Xiaoan said dejectedly, "My cotton can only be used for firewood." That year, Qu Yaoli created a new national record for cotton production, with each mu of two high-yield fields yielding 912 jin.
    The fact that Qu Yaoli's cotton achieved a bumper harvest educated Tan Xiaoan and other farmers. They began to realize that farming also requires technology and learning from advanced experience. Therefore, when Tan Xiaoan drew up a high-yield plan last spring, he did not send it to the district first, nor did he announce it in the village to launch a challenge. Instead, he rode his cart to Qu Yaoli first. He said to Qu Yaoli, "If you teach me all your cotton planting experience, I will send the plan to the district to challenge all cotton farmers in the district; if you don't tell me, I won't send it." Qu Yaoli gave him a satisfactory answer. Tan Xiaoan's spirit of learning was also very good. He went to Qu Zhuangtou Village five times to learn experience, from land preparation and fertilization, warm soup seed soaking, pest control, to pruning and topping. The members of Qu Yaoli's mutual aid team were very happy to see Tan Xiaoan so enthusiastic and active, and everyone was willing to help Tan Xiaoan. During the critical period of cotton growth in the second volt of the lunar calendar, they ran to Tan Xiaoan's place to see if there were any problems without waiting for Tan Xiaoan to come; Deputy Team Leader Gao Jindong went twice. Humble learning and enthusiastic help resulted in a bumper cotton harvest. Tan Xiaoan's mutual aid team planted a total of 57 mu of cotton last year, all of which exceeded the production increase plan. The average yield per mu of irrigated and dry land was 357.7 jin, exceeding the village's average yield by 75.86% and exceeding the average yield of the year before last by 85.1%.
    According to Qu Yaoli's memory, there were more than 400 people like Tan Xiaoan who personally sought Qu Yaoli to learn cotton planting experience. And these more than 400 people were all representatives sent by mutual aid teams or natural villages, and they led more people to learn Qu Yaoli's cotton planting method. Many people who were still making sarcastic remarks in 1951 also learned Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience in 1952.
    Enthusiastic Correspondence, Universal Transmission
    In the office of Qu Yaoli's mutual aid team, there are very high stacks of letters. These letters are mostly written on rough hemp paper, and many characters are written crookedly; however, it can be clearly seen that the letter writers have made painstaking and respectful efforts. Zhang Xingjiu, a farmer from Yanjiazhuang Village, Yi County, wrote in a letter: "The cotton planted in our village has been done according to the methods you told us. The cotton seedlings are dark green, vigorous, and the tips have been topped. Each plant has an average of more than 40 bolls. A bumper harvest in autumn is very promising. In the past two or three days, there has been a phenomenon of boll drop. I don't know if it is due to dense seedlings, drought, pests, or other special reasons. Please tell me how to prevent and control it immediately." There are many such enthusiastic letters to Qu Yaoli learning experience and also telling Qu Yaoli what they have done. Among them are letters from distant Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi, and of course, there are more from various counties in southern Shanxi. From the beginning of thinning seedlings to the end of September, they received a total of 227 such letters. These many letters gave Qu Yaoli great encouragement and enlightenment. He treasured these many letters very much, and "always replied patiently."
    From summer to the end of October, a total of 13 units, 1,476 people, visited Qu Yaoli's cotton fields; in addition, 14 discussion meetings were held, with more than 2,000 people participating. Under the enthusiastic encouragement of the masses, Qu Yaoli personally conducted many transmissions. He has reported six times in the county and district alone, with a total of more than 1,660 people participating in the study. Under the organization and promotion of the Party and the government, and under the publicity and education of the technical transmission stations in various counties and the technical committees in various villages, nearly all of the more than one million cotton farmers in the Yuncheng area directly and indirectly learned Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience. At the beginning of last year, the Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office formulated a plan to promote Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience; and held a training class of more than 600 people, which was personally taught by Qu Yaoli. Various counties have conducted training for technicians and mutual aid team leaders and exhibitions of cotton planting experience. Yuxiang County has trained and transmitted more than 50,000 people, and Jie County has held an exhibition for more than a month, with more than 12,000 visitors.
    Qu Yaoli's Experience Has Been Tested
    Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience has been repeatedly tested in actual production. It can be said that Qu Yaoli's cotton fields last year suffered from many disasters. From the emergence of cotton seedlings to boll formation, natural disasters have not stopped. Following cotton aphids, wind disasters, and freezing disasters, blight also occurred. In particular, the pest disaster and continuous rain and flood disaster that started in early July lasted for more than 50 days, with corn borers, bridge worms, and cotton bollworms constantly invading the cotton bolls. Qu Yaoli's mutual aid team fought against the disaster again and again. They sprayed medicine, but the rain washed it away; they sprayed again, and it was washed away again, and sprayed again. When the cotton boll drop rate was 42.2%, it was estimated that his best cotton fields could harvest 728 jin of cotton; people worried about him, but he was not discouraged; after overcoming the disaster, he strengthened the later pruning and late topping, increasing each plant from nine cotton bolls to fifteen, and finally the highest yield still reached 814 jin. His mutual aid team averaged 530 jin per mu. In the test of practice, some shortcomings in Qu Yaoli's cotton planting have also been corrected. For example, his method of using "stepping on" (that is, stepping on the roots of cotton) to prevent cotton from growing wildly has proven to be useless and harmful. In the actual promotion, the broad masses of cotton farmers have also developed Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience.
    The facts of many high-yielders have proved the benefits of close planting. Last year, when a large number of cotton bolls fell in southern Shanxi due to excessive rain, the cotton farmers in the entire southern Shanxi area clamored, saying that the boll drop was due to close planting, saying that they were harmed by following Qu Yaoli's close planting method. By the time of the final cotton picking, their arguments had changed. Almost all high-yield households implemented Qu Yaoli's close planting method. In Jiang County, the cotton plants per mu in 63 high-yield units were all above 3,500; in Wanquan County, the average cotton plants per mu of the 38 high-yielders who harvested 400 jin of cotton per mu were also above 3,500. The average number of cotton plants per mu in the entire Yuncheng area increased by 20% to 25% compared to the year before last.
    The facts of many high-yielders also consistently illustrate the importance of pruning techniques in Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience. Yao Wenzhang of Huanwangzhuang, Jiang County, is a prominent example. Last year, his dryland cotton high-yield record was second only to Qu Yaoli's irrigated land, with the highest mu yielding 804 jin. In addition to close planting and sand mulching with sufficient fertilizer, he also divided Qu Yaoli's five prunings into two rounds each, plus one additional round, for a total of eleven rounds, which was more detailed. He also clearly affirmed that early pruning is to promote cotton growth, and late pruning is to help cotton bolls mature earlier. Many farmers in Dongguan Village, Ruicheng County, and Wuting Village, Wanquan County, only harvested 20 to 30 jin of ginned cotton per mu because they did not prune.
    Many examples also repeatedly illustrate that to achieve high yields, it is necessary to comprehensively and completely learn Qu Yaoli's experience; it is impossible to achieve high yields by extracting only one point from it. Some cotton farmers who did not fully understand Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience often unilaterally understood that Qu Yaoli's high yield was only due to sufficient water, abundant fertilizer, and close planting. Many cotton fields in Southeast Street Village, Jie County, did apply a lot of fertilizer, had sufficient rainwater, and were also densely planted, but the cotton grew like grape vines, and the cotton harvest was very small. Some farmers said, "We have suffered from Qu Yaoli's disaster!" However, after visiting the cotton fields in Yanjia Village in the neighborhood, they realized that this was because they had not managed the pruning well. Yanjia Village also implemented close planting, and the rainfall and fertilizer conditions were the same as those in Southeast Street Village, but the cotton in Yanjia Village did not grow madly, and the entire village achieved high yields.
    High Yield and Getting Organized are Inseparable
    To comprehensively implement Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, there must be sufficient labor to engage in complex labor with meticulous division of labor. In this way, the organized mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have become an important foundation for learning Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience. Zhang Zhongxiao of Jie Village, Anyi, relied on his six mu of good irrigated land. Last year, he planned to harvest 1,000 jin or at least 800 jin of seed cotton per mu. In addition to applying 1,000 jin of horse manure per mu, he also applied 200 jin of soybean cake, but because he did not have enough labor to carry out complex labor such as pruning, he only harvested more than 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. On the contrary, the 9.8 mu of alkaline land in a mutual aid team in the same village harvested 361 jin of seed cotton per mu. The reason was that after they were organized, they had enough labor to carry out cotton field processing. Agricultural production cooperatives have shown even greater advantages in implementing Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience. In the past, when the households of the Li Jingcai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongji County were not yet established, they planted more than 70 mu of cotton, and each mu only harvested 345 jin; last year, after the agricultural production cooperative was established, they planted 150 mu of cotton, and the average yield of each mu of cotton field was 405 jin. In the high-yield units in Yuncheng area, individual households accounted for a tiny proportion. In the 163 high-yield units in Yongji and Yuanqu counties, there were only 23 individual households. At the same time as promoting Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, mutual aid teams have developed unprecedentedly. Xia County had only 210 mutual aid teams the year before last; by the fall of last year, it had developed to 3,048 teams.

    曲耀离的植棉方法经受了考验
    任志浩  吴钢
    在晋南，如果你要问“去年棉花为什么会丰产”，每个农民都会告诉你：“组织起来了，学习了曲耀离的先进经验。”确实，正确地学习了曲耀离植棉经验的人，都获得了比以往要高的收成。前年全运城专区平均每亩棉花收获一百二十六斤；去年虽然发生了水、旱、虫、霜四种灾害，棉花平均产量仍提高到一百五十斤以上；比抗日战争前每亩平均多收四十多斤。
        谭小安的故事
    农民抛弃旧的耕作习惯，接受先进的植棉技术，是要经过许多斗争的。
    解县龙居村农民谭小安，是和曲耀离在一起赶车二十多年的老朋友。但是，一九五○年，当曲耀离创造了每亩地收籽棉七百多斤的新纪录时，谭小安既不相信，又不服气。他说：“曲耀离的那两下我还不知道！他还能有什么了不起的技术。种庄稼没巧，粪大墒饱。我多上粪也能丰产。”一九五一年他决心背地和曲耀离比赛，一心一意要压倒曲耀离。因此，他就拼命往地里上粪。为了怕人说他也是下粪多才丰产，他就偷偷地干。夜半更深，人们都睡熟了，他却悄悄地套起大车往地里送粪。他在一亩地里上了六大车厩肥、六斗黑豆和二百斤大麻饼的底肥。在棉花长到七八个果枝时，他又偷偷地上了四十斤肥田粉做追肥。总计每亩地光肥料投资就有四十八万元。谭小安实指望他的棉花能得到好收成，超过曲耀离。他的棉花棵子也确实比谁家的都长得高。他的地邻们说：“小安的棉花，摘花的时候还得架梯子哩！”谭小安也夸口说：“我的棉花秆上能站住人！”可是，不讲究技术总是不行。谭小安的棉花空长了些秆子，棉桃并不多，每亩地连霜后花和因为叶子太多不见阳光而沤烂了的棉桃子，一共收了五百来斤籽棉。这在当地还不算是太低的产量。但是，就是棉花质量太低，拿到供销合作社卖不了。谭小安泄气地说：“我的棉花只能烧火啦。”这一年，曲耀离却又创造了全国棉花丰产的新纪录，二亩丰产地每亩收到了九百一十二斤。
    曲耀离棉花丰产的事实教育了谭小安，也教育了其他农民。他们开始认识到种地也需要讲技术，学习先进经验。因此，谭小安在去年春天订出丰产计划时，不先把它送到区上，也不在村里公布发起挑战，却骑上车子先去送给曲耀离。他对曲耀离说：“如果你把全部植棉经验教给我，我就把计划送到区上向全区棉农挑战；你要不告诉我，我就不送了。”曲耀离给了他以满意的答复。谭小安学习的精神也真好，从整地施肥、温汤浸种、治虫到整枝、打顶，就去曲庄头村学习了五次经验。曲耀离互助组的组员看到谭小安这样热情积极，都很高兴，谁都愿意帮助谭小安。在二伏天棉花生长的决定关头，他们不等谭小安来，就亲自跑到谭小安那里去看有什么毛病没有；副组长高进东就去过两次。虚心的学习和热情的帮助，换来了棉花的丰收。谭小安互助组去年一共种了五十七亩棉花，都超额完成增产计划，水旱地每亩平均收到三百五十七斤七两，超过全村平均产量的百分之七十五点八六，超过前年平均产量的百分之八十五点一。
    像谭小安这样亲自找曲耀离学习植棉经验的，从曲耀离记忆里能够算起来的就有四百多人。而这四百多人，都是互助组或自然村派来的代表，他们带动着更多群众学会了曲耀离的植棉法。许多一九五一年还在说风凉话的人，一九五二年也都学习了曲耀离的植棉经验。
    热情的通信，普遍的传授
    在曲耀离互助组的办公室里，有很高的一叠一叠的信件。这些信大都是写在粗糙的麻纸上，许多字写得歪歪扭扭的；但是，可以明显地看出写信的人费力而恭敬的心情。猗氏县阎家庄农民章星九的来信说：“我村种的棉花都照你告给的办法做了。棉秧黑绿，精神旺盛，顶尖已打过，每株平均有四十多个桃子，秋季丰收大有把握。近两三天来有落蕾现象，不知是苗稠天旱、虫害或其它特殊原因。如何防治，请即告知。”有许多这样向曲耀离学习经验、同时又把他们的做法告给曲耀离的充满热情的信件。其中有来自遥远的福建、江西、陕西的，晋南各县来的当然就更多了。从开始间苗到九月底，他们一共收到二百二十七封这样的信件。这许多信给了曲耀离以极大的鼓舞和启示。他很珍贵这许多来信，而且“有来必往，耐心答复”。
    从夏季到十月底，参观曲耀离棉花的共有十三个单位，一千四百七十六人；另外，开过十四次座谈会，有二千多人参加。曲耀离在群众热情的鼓舞下，又亲自进行了许多次传授。仅在本县和本区就报告过六次，共有一千六百六十余人参加学习。全运城专区一百多万棉农，在党和政府的组织推动下，在各县技术传授站和各村技术委员会的宣传教育下，差不多都直接间接学习了曲耀离的先进植棉经验。去年一开春，运城专署就制订了推广曲耀离先进植棉经验的计划；并举办了六百多人的训练班，由曲耀离亲自传授。各县都进行了技术员、互助组长的训练和植棉经验的展览。虞乡县就训练传授过五万余人，解县并开了一个多月的展览会，参观人数在一万二千人以上。
    曲耀离的经验受到了考验
    曲耀离先进植棉经验，在实际生产中一再受到考验。曲耀离的棉田去年的棉花可说是多灾多难，从棉苗出土直到结桃，自然灾害就没有间断过。紧接着棉蚜、风灾、冻灾之后，又发生了立枯病。尤其是七月初起的虫灾、霪雨涝灾，为害竟达五十余天，玉谷螟、造桥虫、棉铃虫不断侵害着棉桃。曲耀离互助组一次又一次地和灾害斗争。他们喷上药，雨冲了；再喷又被冲了，再喷。当棉花落铃在百分之四十二点二时，估计他最好的棉田能收花七百二十八斤；人们为他担忧，但他并没有灰心；战胜灾害以后，又加强了后期的整枝和晚打顶，每株由九个棉桃增到十五个，最后最高产量还是达到了八百一十四斤。他的互助组每亩平均产五百三十斤。在实践的考验中，曲耀离植棉中的某些缺点也得到了修正。如他用“踩一脚”（即用脚踩一下棉花根部）的办法防止棉花狂长，事实证明这是无益而且有害的。在实际的推广中，广大的棉农们也发展了曲耀离的先进植棉经验。
    许多丰产者的事实，证明了密植的好处。在去年晋南因多雨而致棉花大批落铃时，整个晋南棉农们都吵嚷起来，他们说落铃起于密植，说他们跟上曲耀离的密植法受了害。到最后摘花的时候，他们的论调才改变了。凡是丰产户几乎都是实行了曲耀离的密植法。绛县六十三个丰产单位，每亩棉株均在三千五百株以上；万泉县的三十八个每亩收棉四百斤的丰产者，每亩平均也在三千五百株以上。全运城专区每亩平均棉花株数，比前年增加了百分之二十至二十五。
    许多丰产者的事实，也一致说明曲耀离植棉经验中的整枝技术的重要。绛县郇王庄姚文章便是一个突出的例子。他去年旱地棉花丰产纪录仅次于曲耀离的水地，最高的一亩收到八百零四斤。他除了密植和铺沙并有足够的肥料等以外，又把曲耀离五次整枝每次都分成两回进行，外加一次，共十一次，更为细致了。他并且明确地肯定了：先期整枝是为了促进棉花生长，后期整枝是为了帮助棉桃早熟。芮城县的东观村和万泉县的乌亭村的许多农民，因为不整枝，结果每亩地只收了二、三十斤皮棉。
    许多事例还一再说明：要达到丰产必须全面地完整地学习曲耀离的经验；单只抽出其中的某一点，也不可能丰产。没有全面了解曲耀离植棉经验的一些棉农们，往往片面地了解为曲耀离之所以丰产，只不过是水足、粪大、密植。解县东南街村的许多棉田，粪倒是上的多，雨水也足，而且也密植了，可是棉花却长得像葡萄蔓一般，收花很少。有些农民就说：“遭了曲耀离的祸了！”但是，他们在参观了邻村阎家村的棉田后，才知道这是没有很好地进行整枝管理的缘故。阎家村也实行了密植，雨量和肥料条件也和东南街村相同，但阎家村的棉花并没有长得发狂，全村都丰产了。
    丰产和组织起来是分不开的
    要全面的实行曲耀离植棉经验，便要有足够的劳动力从事有细密分工的复杂劳动，这样，组织起来的互助组、农业生产合作社便成为学习曲耀离植棉经验的重要基础。安邑界村张忠孝自恃自己有六亩好水地，去年计划每亩要收到一千斤少至八百斤的籽棉，他除每亩地上了一千斤马粪外，又上了二百斤豆饼，但因他没有足够的劳动力进行整枝等复杂的劳动，每亩只收了一百余斤籽棉。相反，同村的
    一个互助组的九亩八分碱地，每亩却收籽棉三百六十一斤，原因便在于他们组织起来后有足够的劳动力去进行棉田加工。农业生产合作社在实行曲耀离植棉经验中更显示出了优越性。永济县李敬才农业生产合作社的各户，前年未成立合作社时，共种七十多亩棉花，每亩地只收了三百四十五斤；去年成立起农业生产合作社后，种了一百五十亩棉花，每亩棉田平均产棉四百零五斤。运城专区丰产单位中，单干户占着微小的比例，永济、垣曲县的一百六十三个丰产单位中，单干户只有二十三个。与推广曲耀离植棉经验的同时，互助组空前发展起来。夏县前年还只有二百一十个互助组；到去年秋季，已发展到三千零四十八个组。
