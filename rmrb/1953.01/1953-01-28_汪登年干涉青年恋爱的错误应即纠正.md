    Wang Dengnian's Mistake of Interfering with Young People's Love Affairs Should Be Corrected Immediately
    Editor: My name is Zhang Fan, I am 29 years old, and I work in the CPC Huaibei Salt Special District Committee. My love affair with Sun Zhanzhong (a member of the Communist Youth League) from the Chengang Office of the People's Bank of China, Xin Hailian Branch, was illegally interfered with by Wang Dengnian, the director of the office. Comrade Ai Ming criticized this issue on October 21st of last year in the People's Daily under the title "The Chengang Office of the People's Bank of China, Xinpu County, Has a Wrong Understanding of the Marriage Law." However, there has been no response. To clarify the issue, I will add some more information.
    On October 7th of last year, I reported this matter to the three leading bodies of the CPC Xin Hailian Municipal Committee, the Communist Youth League Xin Hailian Municipal Work Committee, and the People's Bank of China, Xin Hailian Branch, requesting them to handle it. Later, I inquired about it about ten more times, but the answer I received was always "We are preparing to handle it immediately," etc. However, after a month, Comrade Wang Dengnian not only did not make any self-criticism, but also made an "assessment" of Sun Zhanzhong:
    "He does not trust the organization, does not rely on the leadership or comrades, acts arbitrarily, and lacks organizational concept...; liberalism is quite serious, and he does not trust the leadership." I believe this is an act of retaliation, a manifestation of being irresponsible to revolutionary comrades based on personal preferences. At the same time, Comrade Wang Dengnian also used the name of the "masses" to "accuse" me to our organization, saying that I have "1. a consistently bad ideology; 2. consistently contacting and establishing relationships with immoral women; 3. using material things to lure women (I gave my lover a few books), which is a hooligan tactic, a bourgeois view of love, and a typical figure of playing with women;" He also said: 4. Sun Zhanzhong's appeal and accusation against him was "instigated" by me, "creating" their "division"; 5. Our love affair "affected the progress of the 'Three-Anti' Movement"; 6. "Sun Zhanzhong has no desire to divorce," which I "sabotaged"; 7. We "corrupted the revolutionary ranks." On November 27th of last year, I submitted my opinions to the above three leading bodies in written form. I requested them to send someone to investigate. After a few days, there was still no response, so I went to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Xin Hailian Municipal Committee to inquire in person. The responsible comrade only "explained" to me and then ignored it. When Comrade Tian, the secretary of the Communist Youth League Xin Hailian Municipal Work Committee, met me, he sternly accused me, saying: "There are inappropriate words in the letter (the written material I went to on November 27th of last year)." There was also no result. On the bank side, because it was difficult to meet, I did not go.
    Up to now, this matter has not been dealt with. I ask the People's Daily to help us solve it. In addition, it is said that the female comrades in the Chengang Office are being restricted from contacting the outside world by a method of surveillance. Please also help the People's Daily to solve this matter.　Zhang Fan
    Editor's Note: According to the situation reflected by the reader Zhang Fan, the situation of Wang Dengnian, the director of the Chengang Office of the People's Bank of China, Xin Hailian Branch, interfering with young people's love affairs is serious. The CPC Xin Hailian Municipal Committee, the Communist Youth League Xin Hailian Municipal Work Committee, and the People's Bank of China, Xin Hailian Branch should quickly handle it and inform this newspaper of the handling results as soon as possible.

### 汪登年干涉青年恋爱的错误应即纠正

    汪登年干涉青年恋爱的错误应即纠正
    编辑同志：我叫张范，年二十九岁，在中共淮北盐特区委会工作。我和中国人民银行新海连支行陈港办事处孙展中（青年团员）恋爱被该办事处主任汪登年非法干涉的问题，曾经艾明同志于去年十月二十一日在人民日报上以“人民银行新浦县陈港办事处对婚姻法的认识有错误”为题批评过。但一直没有答复。为了把问题弄清，我再补充一些情况。
    这件事，去年十月七日我已经分别向中共新海连市委会、青年团新海连市工作委员会、中国人民银行新海连支行三个领导机关报告请求处理。后来我又曾经催问约十次之多，但得到的答复总是“马上即准备处理”等等。但过了一个月，汪登年同志不但没有作任何检讨，反而对孙展中作了一次“鉴定”：
    “不相信组织，不依靠领导或同志，独断独行，更缺乏组织观念……；自由主义相当严重，不信任领导。”我认为这是一种报复行为，是以个人好恶为出发点、对革命同志不负责任的表现。同时，汪登年同志还借“群众”名义向我们机关“控告”我，说我“一、一贯的恶劣思想；二、一贯和不正派妇女接触并建立关系；三、用物质引诱女性（我送过几本书给我爱人），是流氓手段，资产阶级恋爱观点，是玩弄女性的典型人物；”又说：四、孙展中上诉控告他，是我“挑拨”他们“团结”，“造成”他们“对立”；五、因我们恋爱“影响了‘三反’运动的进行”；六、“孙展中并无离婚要求”，是我 “破坏”的；七、我们“腐蚀了革命阵营”。去年十
    一月二十七日，我又用书面材料把我的意见向上述三个领导机关提出。我请求他们派人调查。过了几天仍然没有答复，我就到中共新海连市委会纪律检查委员会去当面催问，负责同志仅向我“解释”了一番，就不管了。青年团新海连市工作委员会书记田同志见我时，严厉地指责我说：“信（去年十一月二十七日我去的书面材料）中有词句不妥。”也没有结果。银行方面，因接见困难，我没有去。
    直到现在，这件事还没有处理。我要求人民日报帮助我们解决。另外，据说陈港办事处的女同志，被用一种监视的方法限制和外界接近。这事也请人民日报帮助解决。　张　范
    编者按：据读者张范反映的情况来看，中国人民银行新海连支行陈港办事处主任汪登年干涉青年恋爱的情况是严重的。中共新海连市委会、青年团新海连市工作委员会和中国人民银行新海连支行应该迅速加以处理，并尽快把处理结果告知本报。
