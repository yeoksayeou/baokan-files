Respected Chairman Mao:

We, in Duyun County, Guizhou Province, held an agricultural bumper harvest model worker conference. The People's Government awarded us bumper harvest model workers many prizes such as oxen, plows, plowshares, harrows, hoes, and sickles. We, the fifty-seven bumper harvest model workers from various ethnic minority groups, have decided to write you a letter to express our heartfelt feelings.

This time, when we went to the county to attend the conference, as we wore big red flowers, held prizes in our hands, and looked at your portrait, we felt indescribable joy and honor in our hearts. Looking back, the Kuomintang reactionary ruling class did not treat us, the people of ethnic minorities, as human beings. We didn’t even dare to pass in front of their gates, fearing some disaster would befall us. Exorbitant taxes and levies rained down on us like hail; the oppression and exploitation by the local bullies and landlords weighed on us like boulders, preventing us from lifting our heads or breathing freely. In 1949, you liberated us. We, the people of various ethnic minority groups, together with the Han people, under your wise leadership, organized ourselves to eliminate the landlord class and were distributed land, houses, livestock, and farming tools. We also established our own joint governments of all ethnic groups to manage our own affairs. In the past, we had no place to speak our minds; now we can speak on the stage. In the past, we had no opportunity to study; now the People's Government helps us establish people's schools and night schools, and our men, women, old, and young can all go to school. In the past, we couldn't even exchange a dou of rice for a jin of salt; now the People's Government fairly and reasonably supplies us with salt and even delivers it to our doorsteps. In short, only under your leadership can we, the ethnic minorities, have food to eat, clothes to wear, salt to eat, and a good life. Only then can we work diligently and actively in production, be selected as model workers, and receive today's glory and the love of the masses. We discussed: Why was this year's (1952) harvest so good? Why could we become model workers? We believe there are only two reasons: first, with your wise leadership, we have a guide. You are like a bright light in the night, illuminating our path forward. In addition, the Chinese people are diligent and brave. Under your call for "increasing production and practicing economy," we cultivate carefully, apply fertilizer, fight disasters, and select seeds, which allowed us to achieve a bumper harvest. We think of the countless hardships and difficulties that you and countless revolutionary heroes went through for our liberation, and we feel that our struggle against natural disasters in production today is much easier. Moreover, the People's Government helps us very thoughtfully. We were able to obtain land because countless revolutionary martyrs shed their blood, and we must cultivate it with all our hearts. The second reason is that we responded to your call to "organize" and joined mutual aid teams. Collective labor allows three people’s work to be completed by two. The strength of the masses is great, guaranteeing that we can overcome difficulties, defeat natural disasters, and increase production.

Chairman Mao, the glorious title of model worker that we have obtained is inseparable from your wise leadership; this glory should be attributed to you. Although we have been praised and rewarded by the County People's Government, we will never be arrogant; we will further learn from the masses and learn various advanced production techniques. We will also never be conservative; we must honestly publicize and promote our experiences to the masses. Not only must we be model workers in everything, but we must also enable more people to achieve bumper harvests. We will also strive to become national bumper harvest model workers and come to Beijing to see you. We will definitely work a hundred times harder and guarantee that we will do what we say!

    贵州都匀县少数民族五十七个丰产模范
    决心学习先进生产技术争取更大丰产敬爱的毛主席：我们贵州省都匀县开了一个农业丰产模范大会，人民政府给我们丰产模范发了耕牛、犁头、铧口、钉耙、锄头、镰刀等很多奖品。我们各少数民族的五十七个丰产模范商量，要给您写封信来表达我们的心意。
    这回我们到县里开会，当我们身上戴上大红花、手里拿着奖品、眼睛看到您的像的时候，心里感到有说不出的快乐和光荣。回想过去，国民党反动统治阶级不把我们少数民族的人民当人看，我们连他们大门口都不敢过，怕受到什么灾难。苛捐杂税像冰雹一样打在我们的头上；恶霸地主敲诈盘剥，像大石头一样压得我们抬不起头、出不得气。一九四九年，您解放了我们。我们各少数民族人民和汉族人民一道，在您英明领导下，组织起来消灭了地主阶级，分得了田地、房屋、耕畜、农具；又成立了各族人民自己的联合政府，来管理自己的事情，过去我们有话无处说，现在我们能上台说话了。过去我们没有读书的机会，现在人民政府帮助我们成立了民校、夜校，我们男女老少都能进学堂了。过去我们一斗米都换不到一斤盐巴，现在人民政府公平合理地供给我们盐巴，还把盐巴送到我们的家门口。总而言之，只有在您的领导下，我们少数民族才有饭吃，有衣穿，有盐巴吃，有好日子过；也才能安心积极生产，当选模范，得到今天的光荣和群众的热爱。我们讨论：为什么今年子（一九五二年）的庄稼收得这样好？为那样我们能当上模范？我们认为原因只有两个：头一个，有了您英明的领导，我们就有了带路人。您好像晚上的明灯，照耀着我们前进的方向。加上我们中国人民是勤劳勇敢的，大家在您“增产节约”的号召下，精耕细作，加工施肥，抗灾选种，才能得到丰收。我们想起您和无数革命英雄们为了我们的翻身事业所经过的无数艰苦困难，就觉到我们今天在生产中向自然灾害作斗争是容易得多了；何况人民政府又十分周到地帮助我们。我们能得到土地，是无数革命先烈用血换来的，我们一定要用心去耕作。第二点原因，我们响应了您“组织起来”的号召，参加了互助组，集体劳动，三个人的活两个人就可以做完。人多力量大，保证了我们能克服困难，战胜自然灾害，提高产量。
    毛主席，我们得了模范的光荣称号，是与您英明的领导分不开的；这个光荣应该归于您。虽然我们得到了县人民政府的表扬和奖励，但决不骄傲，还要进一步向群众学习，学习各种先进的生产技术。我们也决不保守，一定要把我们的经验老老实实向群众宣传推广。我们不但自己要事事做模范，并且要使更多的人得到丰产。我们还要争取做全国丰产模范，到北京来看看您老人家。我们一定百倍努力，保证说到做到！  贵州省都匀县苗族、水族、彝族丰产模范五十七人
