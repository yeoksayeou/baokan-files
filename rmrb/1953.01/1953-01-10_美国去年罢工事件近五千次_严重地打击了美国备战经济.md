Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: The American working class's struggle for higher wages, improved working conditions, and workers' welfare reached its peak since 1946 last year.

According to figures from the U.S. Department of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a total of 4,950 strike incidents occurred in the United States in 1952, only 35 fewer than in 1946, which had the highest number of strikes in American history. Obviously, if the Truman government had not been constantly suppressing strikes based on the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law enacted in 1947, the number of strikes last year would have been even higher than in 1946. Approximately 3.5 million workers participated in strikes last year, about 60 percent more than in 1951. The total loss of working days due to all strikes reached 55 million.

According to statistics released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 34 large-scale strikes in the United States in 1952, each involving more than 10,000 participants. The largest of these was the steelworkers' strike, with 650,000 participants, lasting for two months. In last year's strike struggles, American workers persisted for more than a month in eleven instances, with two strikes involving tens of thousands of people lasting for almost three months.

Despite Truman's ban on strikes that supposedly affected "national defense," last year's strikes by American workers severely hit the U.S. war economy, affected U.S. munitions production, and even directly threatened the supply of weapons to U.S. troops invading Korea.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's plan to build atomic bomb factories was also affected by five major strikes.

    美国去年罢工事件近五千次  严重地打击了美国备战经济
    【新华社九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国工人阶级去年争取提高工资、改善工作环境及工人生活福利的罢工斗争，达到了一九四六年以来的最高峰。
    根据美国劳工部及劳工统计局的数字，一九五二年美国一共发生了四千九百五十次罢工事件，比美国历史上罢工次数最多的一九四六年只少三十五次。显然，如果不是杜鲁门政府根据一九四七年制定的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法进行不断的压迫，去年罢工的次数将比一九四六年还多。去年参加罢工的工人约有三百五十万，比一九五一年约多百分之六十。全部罢工所造成的工作日的损失达五千五百万个。
    根据劳工统计局公布的统计，美国一九五二年发生了三十四次上万人参加的大规模的罢工。其中最大的一次是钢铁工人罢工，参加者六十五万人，历时两个月之久。美国工人在去年的罢工斗争中有十一次坚持到一个月以上，其中有两次上万人的罢工几乎达三个月之久。
    尽管杜鲁门禁止所谓影响“国防”的罢工，但美国工人去年的罢工严重地打击了美国的备战经济，影响了美国的军火生产，甚至曾直接威胁了侵略朝鲜美军的武器供应。
    美国原子能委员会建筑原子弹工厂的计划，也先后受到五次大罢工的影响。
