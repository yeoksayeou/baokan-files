    All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Decision on Strengthening Trade Union Work in Basic Construction

    Basic construction is the fundamental link in our country's construction endeavors, and its quality and speed will determine the degree and pace of national industrialization. However, the most important part of basic construction—the construction industry—faces many problems: production methods are very backward; civil engineering and installation work are complex; old management methods, foreman-style practices, and guild ideologies have not been completely eliminated; many technical workers who should be fixed are not yet fixed, and so on. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen trade union work in basic construction. To this end, the following decisions are made:

    I. The basic tasks of trade union organizations in basic construction departments are, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to organize workers, technicians, and staff in basic construction, continuously improve their class consciousness, and ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of various planned targets in basic construction; assist industrial and engineering departments in improving the working conditions of the masses of employees to the extent possible and raising their technical level; care for the lives of the masses and run welfare programs well. To ensure the achievement of these tasks, the following tasks must be carried out:

    (1) Mobilize employees to discuss the engineering plans of the construction site or section to which they belong, and put forward various rationalization proposals to ensure quality, shorten construction periods, and reduce costs; organize mass labor competitions, summarize and promote advanced work experience, continuously improve technology, improve labor organization, and increase labor productivity, so as to achieve fast, good, and economical results, strengthen organizational leadership, implement the production responsibility system, and overcome the chaotic phenomenon of construction sites; and assist industrial and engineering departments in formulating reasonable technical norms and wage standards, and systematically make technical workers fixed according to a certain ratio, so as to lay the foundation for the factoryization of construction workers.

    (2) Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, trade union organizations in basic construction departments should organize employees to carry out political study, pay attention to overcoming various non-working-class ideas, improve class consciousness, strengthen organization and discipline, and, in coordination with industrial and engineering departments, organize technical study. At the same time, in accordance with the characteristics of the mobility of construction workers, where necessary and possible, organize mobile cultural troupes, film projection teams, and mobile book boxes to strengthen the cultural and recreational activities of the masses of employees. In some construction sites with the necessary conditions, work to eliminate illiteracy can be carried out.

    (3) Construction projects often involve outdoor and high-altitude operations, and casualties and illnesses often occur. Therefore, trade union organizations should pay special attention to labor protection and welfare work. In the construction preparation stage, issues such as employees' diet, housing, and medical care should be appropriately resolved; assist industrial and engineering departments in running canteens, drinking water stations, and cooperatives, and solving the needs of employees in life such as haircuts, baths, clothing repairs, shoe repairs, postal services, remittances, and other issues.

    II. In order to make good preparations for basic construction in 1953, it is necessary to assist industrial and engineering departments in grasping the winter training work of the masses of employees, strengthening political education, paying special attention to summarizing and learning various advanced experiences, and improving the political consciousness and technical level of the masses of employees. Summarizing and learning advanced experiences should not be limited to civil engineering projects, but also to mechanical and electrical installation, metal structure, and other types of work, to facilitate promotion. At the same time, attention should be paid to strengthening ideological education for engineering and technical personnel. Construction trade unions and local and industrial trade unions with larger basic construction tasks should also, based on possible conditions, use the winter off-season to run basic construction grassroots trade union cadre training classes, summarize the experience of grassroots trade union work, and rectify grassroots organizations. And prepare cadres for new factories and mines.

    III. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of trade union work in basic construction, trade union organizations should add or strengthen special management agencies for basic construction, and appropriately solve the division of labor and cooperation in work between industrial and local construction trade unions or other industrial trade unions:

    (1) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions shall establish a Basic Construction Committee under the Standing Committee, with the participation of relevant industrial trade unions, to be responsible for guiding all matters related to trade union work in basic construction.

    (2) Local trade unions at all levels with basic construction tasks should establish Basic Construction Committees to be responsible for exchanging advanced experiences related to basic construction between various industries and conducting regular inspections and supervision. The director of the committee shall be concurrently held by the chairman or vice-chairman of the local trade union at each level, and one or two full-time deputy directors may be appointed according to work needs; members shall be responsible personnel from relevant industrial trade unions at each level in charge of basic construction.

    (3) All industrial trade unions corresponding to industrial and engineering departments with basic construction tasks should establish special management agencies for basic construction. The industrial trade union organizations in the areas where their projects are located should also establish special management agencies for basic construction and should equip them with stronger cadres who are responsible for leading trade union work in basic construction in their respective industries.

    (4) Construction trade unions at all levels are responsible for leading the trade union work of various companies and construction sites under the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government, and, as needed, cooperate with the trade union work of basic construction sites of other industrial departments.

    IV. The staffing of grassroots trade union organizations in various construction areas is generally stipulated that one cadre detached from production may be set up for every 200 or more workers. If the income from membership dues is small, the grassroots trade union organization's various funding issues, in addition to being allocated by the industrial and engineering departments in accordance with government regulations, any shortfall shall be negotiated by the local trade union and the local industrial and engineering departments, and specific measures shall be formulated and reported to the relevant central departments for approval and implementation; whether the cultural, educational, and labor protection expenses are managed by the local trade union or the industrial trade union can also be resolved through consultation based on specific circumstances.

    V. Trade union work in basic construction is important and also a new and unfamiliar task, and we lack the necessary knowledge and work experience. Therefore, trade union cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, should pay attention to learning various basic knowledge related to basic construction and summarizing on-site work experience in order to gradually explore a set of methods for doing a good job in trade union work in basic construction.

    VI. All industrial, large administrative region, provincial, and municipal trade union organizations related to the national basic construction task should conduct research based on this decision and their own tasks, put forward specific measures and plans, and report them to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions level by level.

    中华全国总工会
    关于加强基本建设中工会工作的决定
    基本建设是我国建设事业上目前的根本环节，它的质量好坏，进度快慢，将决定国家工业化的程度与速度。而基本建设中最重要的部分——建筑工业，却存在着很多问题：生产方法很落后；土建、安装工种复杂；旧的管理方法、把头作风、行会思想尚未彻底清除；很多应该固定的技术工人尚未固定等等。因此，加强基本建设中的工会工作，是十分必要的。为此特作如下决定：
    一、基本建设部门的工会组织的基本任务，是在中国共产党的领导下，组织基本建设中的工人、技术人员、职员，不断提高阶级觉悟，保证完成与超额完成基本建设中的各项计划指标；协助工业工程部门在可能范围内改善职工群众的劳动条件，提高技术水平；关心群众生活，办好福利事业。为保证达成这些任务，就必须进行以下几项工作：
    （一）发动职工讨论所属工地或工段的工程计划，提出保证质量、缩短工期及降低成本的各种合理化建议；组织群众性的劳动竞赛，总结与推广先进工作经验，不断地改进技术，改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，做到又快、又好、又省，加强组织领导，贯彻生产责任制，克服工地的混乱现象；并协助工业工程部门制定合理的技术定额和工资标准，有计划有步骤地作好技术工人按比例的固定化的工作，为建筑工人工厂化奠定基础。
    （二）基本建设部门的工会组织，应在中国共产党的领导下，组织职工群众进行政治学习，注意克服各种非工人阶级的思想，提高阶级觉悟，加强组织性与纪律性，并与工业工程部门配合组织技术学习。同时，适应建筑工人流动的特点，在必要与可能的条件下，组织流动的文工队、电影放映队、流动图书箱，以加强职工群众的文化娱乐活动。在某些条件具备的工地，可以进行扫除文盲工作。
    （三）建筑工程多为露天作业与高空作业，伤亡事故和疾病是常常发生的。因此，工会组织应特别注意劳动保护与福利工作。在施工准备阶段，就应该适当地解决职工的饮食、居住、医疗等问题；协助工业工程部门办好食堂、饮水站、合作社，解决理发、洗澡、缝补衣服、钉鞋、邮寄、汇兑以及职工群众生活上需要解决的其他问题。
    二、为了做好一九五三年基本建设的准备工作，应协助工业工程部门，抓紧冬季职工群众的训练工作，加强政治教育，特别注意总结与学习各种先进经验，提高职工群众的政治觉悟与技术水平。总结与学习先进经验不应仅限于土建工程方面，也要注意机电安装、金属结构等项工种，以利推广。同时，应注意加强对工程技术人员的思想教育工作。建筑工会及基本建设任务较大的地方工会和产业工会，还应根据可能条件，利用冬季休工时期，举办基本建设基层工会干部训练班，总结基层工会工作的经验，整顿基层组织。并为新建厂、矿准备干部。
    三、为了加强基本建设中工会工作的组织与领导，工会组织应增添或充实基本建设的专管机构，并适当解决产业与地方建筑工会或其他产业工会之间的工作上的分工与配合问题：
    （一）中华全国总工会，在常委会下设立基本建设委员会，吸收有关产业工会参加，负责指导基本建设中工会工作的一切事宜。
    （二）有基本建设任务的各级地方工会，应建立基本建设委员会，负责交流各产业之间有关基本建设的先进经验，进行经常的检查与督促。委员会的主任由各该级地方工会的主席或副主席兼任，根据工作需要，可设专任的副主任委员一至二人；委员由各该级有关产业工会管理基本建设的负责人员充任。
    （三）凡与有基本建设任务的工业工程部门相应的各产业工会，应设立基本建设的专管机构。其工程所在地区之产业工会组织内也应设立基本建设的专管机构，并应配备较强的干部，负责领导各该产业基本建设中的工会工作。
    （四）各级建筑工会，负责领导中央人民政府建筑工程部所属各个公司及施工现场的工会工作，并根据需要，配合其他产业部门基本建设施工现场的工会工作。
    四、各施工地区工会基层组织的编制，一般规定凡有工人二百以上者得设脱离生产干部一人。会费收入较少，工会基层组织各项经费问题除按政府规定请工业工程部门拨付外，不敷之数由地方工会与所在地工业工程部门协商，拟定具体办法报中央有关部门批准实行；文教、劳保费用究归地方工会或产业工会掌管，也可根据具体情况协商解决。
    五、基本建设中的工会工作是重要的也是新的生疏的工作，我们十分缺少必要的知识和工作经验。因此，各级工会干部，特别是领导干部，应注意学习有关基本建设的各种基本知识，总结现场工作经验，以便逐步地摸索出一套搞好基本建设中工会工作的办法。
    六、与国家基本建设任务有关的各产业、大行政区、省、市工会组织，应根据本决定和自己的任务，进行研究，提出具体的措施计划，层报中华全国总工会。
                一九五二年十二月二十三日
