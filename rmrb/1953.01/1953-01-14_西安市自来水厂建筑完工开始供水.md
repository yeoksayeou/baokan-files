    Xi'an Water Plant Completed Construction and Begins Water Supply
    The first water plant in the Northwest region—the Xi'an Water Plant—has completed its construction and has begun supplying water to some government organizations, schools, and residents. Currently, the plant is working diligently to install water equipment and establish collective water stations for users throughout the city, striving to provide a large-scale water supply to residents throughout the city this summer. The water in Xi'an's wells is mostly bitter water, so solving the drinking water problem for the city's 700,000 residents is very important. The Xi'an Municipal People's Government allocated more than 10 billion yuan in April 1950 to begin the construction of this water plant.

    西安市自来水厂建筑完工开始供水
    西北区第一个自来水厂——西安市自来水厂的建筑工程已经完工，并开始对部分机关、学校和住户供水。现在，该厂正紧张地为全市用户安装用水设备和成立集体水站，争取在今年夏天向全市居民大量供水。西安市水井中的水，绝大部分是苦水，所以，解决全市七十万居民的饮水问题是很重要的。西安市人民政府在一九五零年四月即拨款一百多亿元开始建造这个自来水厂。
