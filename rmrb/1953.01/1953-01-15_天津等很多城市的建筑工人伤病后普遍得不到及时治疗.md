To the Editor: We completely agree with the opinions expressed in the letter "Construction Workers Request Resolution of Medical Problems" by comrades Jue Min and Lan Xiu in the "Letters from Readers" column on December 22nd of last year, and the editor's note. The serious situation of a lack of medical institutions and medical personnel for construction workers and construction sites also exists in our Tianjin.

    There are now more than 50,000 construction workers in Tianjin. Larger construction sites are scattered in the suburbs, and the sanitary conditions are very poor: some construction sites were originally graveyards, and corpses and rotten flesh are often dug up during construction, emitting a foul odor; many construction sites have ditches and puddles nearby, with many mosquitoes and fleas. However, some administrative leaders of the construction sites do not pay attention to workers' health issues, and the sanitary facilities on the construction sites are very poor. Therefore, from the start of construction last spring to July and August, the injury and illness rate at each construction site was between 6% and 10%.

    However, our city's construction units only have five clinics, twelve infirmaries, twenty-three doctors, and four contracted hospitals. Clinics and infirmaries are mostly scattered in larger construction sites, but the equipment, medicines, and medical personnel cannot meet the actual needs; it is a common phenomenon in Tianjin that workers with injuries and illnesses do not receive timely treatment. The Dingzigu and Tangjiakou construction sites of the Workers' Construction Company have nearly 2,000 workers, but only one doctor, who only holds clinic hours for three hours a day. Workers have to wait very early to register for treatment, and some haven't even managed to register before the doctor has gone off duty. There are also many units that have no medical institutions at all. The Municipal Housing Construction Engineering Office has hundreds of construction sites, but not even one doctor; it has only established a contracted relationship with the Beimalu Dazhong Hospital in the eighth district. Some construction sites are far from Beimalu, and a round trip requires a lot of travel expenses, which is also detrimental to the sick. For this reason, the trade union has raised objections to the administration, and the administration has also contacted the health authorities, but the result has not been resolved in a timely manner.

    These situations not only affect the health of the workers, but more importantly, to some extent, affect the workers' enthusiasm for production. Some workers say:

    "If we are sick and cannot be treated, we can only watch production suffer losses without being able to do anything." Therefore, we completely agree with the opinions of comrades Jue Min and Lan Xiu and the editor, and request the Central Ministry of Health to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

    In addition, many injuries among construction workers are bone injuries. It is suggested that areas with a large number of construction tasks should pay special attention to increasing orthopedic medical equipment.

Editor's Note: According to many letters from readers we have recently received, the lack of medical equipment and medical personnel for construction workers in large and medium-sized cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Jinan, Wuhan, and Anshan is quite serious. More than 60% of construction sites in Shandong Province now have no medical organizations. Many construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company were transferred from production departments. If they got sick or injured in their original departments, they could get treatment relatively easily, but after going to construction units, there is no way to solve it. At present, many technicians and managers have been transferred from various production departments to strengthen the basic construction departments. We believe that some medical personnel from the production departments should also be transferred to the basic construction departments.

    We believe that in the current situation of a shortage of medical personnel, to solve this problem we must use the method of mobilizing the masses. It is suggested that when the Central Ministry of Health solves this problem, it should strive for the assistance of the medical workers' trade union and other mass organizations of medical workers, jointly mobilize medical workers in various places to conduct discussions, and mobilize them to use appropriate methods, within the possible conditions, to solve the lack of medical care for construction workers, in order to welcome the large-scale economic construction of the motherland.

### 天津等很多城市的建筑工人伤病后普遍得不到及时治疗

    天津等很多城市的建筑工人伤病后普遍得不到及时治疗
    编辑同志：我们完全同意去年十二月二十二日
    “读者来信”栏所载觉民、兰秀二同志关于“建筑工人要求解决医疗问题”的来信和编者按语中提出的意见。建筑工人及建筑工地缺乏医疗机构和医务人员的严重情况，同样存在在我们天津市。
    天津市现在有五万多建筑工人。较大工地都分散在郊区，卫生条件很坏：有些工地原是坟地，施工时经常挖出尸骨烂肉，臭气扑人；很多工地附近有沟渠水坑，蚊蝇跳蚤很多。而有些工地的行政领导干部却不重视工人卫生问题，工地卫生设备很差。因此，从去年春季开工到七、八月份，各工地伤病率都在百分之六到百分之十。
    但是，我们全市各建筑单位却只有诊疗所五处，医务所十二处，大夫二十三人和四个嘱托医院。诊疗所和医务所大都散布在较大的工地中，但设备、药品和医务人员都赶不上实际需要；工人伤病得不到及时治疗，在天津市是个普遍现象。工人建筑公司的丁字沽、唐家口两工地，工人都近两千人，但仅有大夫一人，每天只门诊三个钟头。工人治病要很早等着挂号，有的还没挨上挂号，大夫已经下班了。还有好多单位根本没有医疗机构。市房屋修建工程处有好几百个工地，连一个大夫也没有，仅与八区北马路大众医院建立了嘱托关系。有的工地离北马路很远，往返一次，就要好些路费，对病体也不利。为此，工会曾向行政上提过意见，行政上也同卫生机关联系过，但结果仍未及时解决。
    这些情况不仅影响了工人的健康，更重要的是在某种程度上影响了工人的生产热情。有的工人说：
    “有病不能治，眼看着生产受损失也没办法。”因此，我们完全同意觉民、兰秀二同志和编者的意见，要求中央卫生部及早解决这个问题。
    此外，建筑工人受伤有很多是骨伤，建议有大量建筑任务的地区应该特别注意增加骨科医疗设备。      秋南行
    编者按：根据我们最近收到的许多读者来信看来，像重庆、成都、济南、武汉以及鞍山等大中城市建筑工人缺乏医疗设备和医务人员的问题都是相当严重的。山东全省现在有百分之六十以上的工地没有医疗组织。鞍山钢铁公司的许多建筑工人是从生产部门调去的。他们在原来的部门得了病或受了伤，都能比较容易地得到治疗，但到建筑单位后就没法解决了。目前从各生产部门抽调了很多技术人员和管理人员去加强基本建设部门，我们认为也应该把生产部门的医务人员抽调一些到基本建设部门去。
    我们认为：在目前医务人员缺乏的情况下，要解决这个问题必须运用发动群众的方法。建议中央卫生部在解决这个问题时，争取医务工作者工会及医务工作者的其他群众性组织的协助，共同发动各地医务工作者进行讨论，发动他们在可能的条件下，用适当的方法为建筑工人解决缺乏医疗的问题，以迎接祖国的大规模经济建设。
