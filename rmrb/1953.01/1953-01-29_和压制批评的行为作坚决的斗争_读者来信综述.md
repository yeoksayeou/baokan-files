Recently, we have received a number of letters from readers complaining that they have been subjected to various forms of attack and retaliation for writing letters to newspapers criticizing the shortcomings and errors of leading cadres in their organizations: some have been struggled against, some have been forced to make self-criticisms, some have been transferred to other jobs, some have been denied opportunities to study, and some have had the label of "undisciplined and unorganized" attached to their organizational evaluations.... This shows that the illegal act of suppressing criticism is still seriously prevalent in many places; we must resolutely fight against this phenomenon and severely punish all those who suppress criticism in order to ensure that bottom-up mass criticism can be fully and correctly developed.

Reader Li Yuan from the Civil Affairs Section of the Jinjiang Special Prefecture in Fujian wrote to complain that he used to work in the Civil Affairs Section of Dehua County. On June 13, 1951, the Xiamen Daily published his criticism of Sun Anguo (a Party member and the former head of the county's Civil Affairs Section, now the deputy county head) for sending cadres from the section and misappropriating public funds to Hunan to pick up his wife. Sun Anguo retaliated against him by trying to transfer him while he was ill. After he exposed this in the Xiamen Daily on August 18, the transfer did not happen. On October 12 of the same year, Sun Anguo invited Luo Jintian (a Party member and secretary of the Public Security Bureau), who had been criticized by Li Yuan and was dissatisfied with him, to participate in the Civil Affairs Section's "self-criticism meeting" to jointly struggle against Li Yuan and decided to dismiss him from his position as a section member. On the evening of the 14th, Li Yuan was again struggled against at the "Anti-Unhealthy Tendencies Conference" convened in the name of the county's Youth League Committee. A few days later, Li Yuan was ordered to stop working and reflect on his mistakes; in December, he was transferred to the Construction Section. The Dehua County Committee was aware of all of the above. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, Li Yuan, under the education of the movement, actively offered many opinions to leading cadres such as Lu Xiangyun, the secretary of the county committee, and Li Wenhua, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and exposed the behavior of Sun Anguo, Luo Jintian, and others in suppressing criticism. Unexpectedly, during the ideological review phase of the "Three-Anti" campaign in May 1952, he was again struggled against at the group meeting and was accused of "deliberately attacking leaders" and being "undisciplined and unorganized," and this was used as the basis for his evaluation. In February 1952, Li Yuan wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting the circumstances of being attacked for writing a letter of criticism. After the county committee received the letter from the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructing them to investigate, they asked the Youth League branch where Li Yuan was located to investigate. All the Youth League members believed that Li Yuan's accusations were true; however, the county committee has never dealt with it since. (Editor's note: It is understood that after receiving Li Yuan's letter, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the Jinjiang Prefectural Committee to investigate and deal with it in early March of last year, but so far the Jinjiang Prefectural Committee has not reported the results of the investigation and handling.)

Reader Zhang Mujun from the former Sunan branch of the People's Bank of China wrote to complain that in the early stages of the "Three-Anti" campaign in December of the year before last, he wrote letters to newspapers such as the Shanghai Jiefang Daily criticizing the bank's president, Xin Yuanxi, for misappropriating public funds and other issues. In early January of last year, he was forced to make a self-criticism at a group meeting. Leading Party member cadres such as He Chen, the head of the secretariat section, Lin Maoxin, the head of the document stock, and Zhu Jun, the head of the security section, all said that Zhang Mujun's criticism was "impure in motive, attacking leaders, and showing off individual achievements"; some even said that it was a serious political issue. At that time, embezzlers also took the opportunity to sabotage, saying that they were unwilling to confess their embezzlement because they were afraid of being written about in the newspaper. After the end of the "Three-Anti" campaign, the leading cadres of the bank still discriminated against Zhang Mujun. Zhang Mujun was very distressed and asked to talk to the leading comrades, but no one paid attention to him. Once, when he took sick leave, he went to Wu Tiepeng, the head of the salary and welfare stock of the personnel section. He wanted to talk about ideological issues, but Wu Tiepeng sarcastically called him a "red reporter" and said, "The leaders just don't want to talk to you!" When Zhang Mujun was nominated as a candidate for the trade union committee member by some comrades in August of last year, Lin Maoxin, the head of the document stock, said, "Zhang Mujun didn't raise his opinions to the organization but directly wrote letters of criticism to the newspaper. As a revolutionary cadre, this is not good and is an undisciplined and unorganized political mistake!" In order to reach a consensus with the leading comrades on the issue of treating criticism, Zhang Mujun wrote more than ten reports in a row, but the problem has never been resolved.

Sun Fengming, a mover (Youth League member) from the Sixth Team of the Northeast District of the Suzhou Moving Company in Jiangsu, wrote to complain that he had written a letter to the New Suzhou News reflecting that Comrade Pei Yuezhong, the director of the Northeast District Office of the Moving Company, was not fair and reasonable in allocating workers. The newspaper forwarded this letter to Jiang Chunkun (a Party member), the manager of the Moving Company, for handling. In mid-September of last year, Sun Fengming, with the consent of the trade union and the Youth League organization, went to apply for the former Sunan Technical Workers School and took the application form to Jiang Chunkun for approval. Jiang Chunkun, based on the handwriting on the application form, matched it with the letter of criticism against Pei Yuezhong forwarded by the New Suzhou News and found that it was written by Sun Fengming. He slammed the table and scolded Sun Fengming as "what kind of thing," "not qualified to study, let alone a Youth League member!" Finally, he also said that Sun Fengming had "political problems" and should be dealt with properly. As a result, Sun Fengming was unable to register for study.

After suffering these attacks, these readers were all fearful and distressed. Only after seeing that the local party committees and party newspapers had dealt with some typical cases of suppressing criticism did they dare to expose the facts of their attacks. Another reader wrote to reflect on the situation of being labeled as "undisciplined and unorganized" on the administrative leaders' evaluation for writing a letter of criticism, and also asked the editorial department to keep his name secret and dared not disclose his name publicly.

This phenomenon of suppressing criticism is intolerable. What is especially worth pointing out is that most of the suppressors of criticism reported in the above readers' letters are Communist Party members; the problem is even more serious. The Party has repeatedly educated us that correctly carrying out bottom-up criticism is a necessary method to consolidate the ties between the Party and the people, to guarantee the democratization of the Party and the country, and to accelerate social progress. Therefore, for the active criticism of the people, even if it is not completely correct, we must adopt a revolutionary attitude of warm welcome and resolute protection; suppressing criticism is an anti-Party style. However, those who suppressed criticism reported by the readers above completely violated the teachings of the Party. As soon as they saw the masses raising criticisms to them in the newspapers, they felt that their "dignity" was damaged, became very angry, and did not hesitate to use illegal acts such as holding struggle meetings, forcing critics to examine their motives, and randomly adding "crimes" to the organizational evaluation of the critics to suppress and retaliate. Obviously, this kind of wrong behavior has seriously damaged the Party's prestige, suppressed the enthusiasm of the masses, and hindered the connection between the Party and the masses.

The reason why this situation of suppressing criticism is so serious at present is also because some Party leading organs turn a blind eye to the behavior of suppressing criticism and do not pay attention to it. For example, when the Jinjiang Prefectural Committee of Fujian was instructed by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to investigate and deal with the facts revealed by Li Yuan, it arbitrarily transferred the original letter to the criticized party—the Dehua County Committee—and never asked or heard about it again. This makes the illegal cadres who suppress criticism even bolder and unscrupulous. Some newspapers also have serious shortcomings in handling readers' letters of criticism, failing to fully guarantee and strongly support the active criticism of readers, and failing to wage an uncompromising struggle with those who suppress criticism; this also gives some suppressors of criticism opportunities to take advantage of, and many incidents of suppressing criticism cannot be exposed and dealt with in a timely manner.

We must wage a relentless struggle against acts of suppressing criticism. Party committees at all levels should repeatedly educate Party members to correctly understand the important political significance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, so that they can treat criticism and self-criticism with a correct attitude. Those Party members who suppress criticism must be given serious treatment. In this way, the broad masses of the people can be sure that their criticisms can be effectively guaranteed and supported, dare to actively carry out bottom-up criticisms, and persist in fighting against those who suppress criticism. This newspaper published an editorial on the 23rd, "Those Who Suppress Criticism Are the Party's Deadly Enemies," hoping that cadres at all levels will study it carefully. We hope that the broad masses of readers will actively and boldly expose the behavior of suppressing criticism and widely launch a mass struggle against bureaucracy!

    和压制批评的行为作坚决的斗争
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们连续收到一些读者来信，控诉他们因为给报纸写了批评本机关领导干部缺点和错误的信，而受到了各种打击和报复：有的被斗争，有的被迫作检查，有的被调动工作，有的被不许学习，有的在组织鉴定上被加上“无组织无纪律”的帽子……。这说明：压制批评的非法行为目前在好些地方还是严重存在的；我们必须坚决地和这种现象作严肃的斗争，严厉制裁一切压制批评的人，以保证自下而上的群众性的批评能够充分而正确地展开。
    福建晋江专署民政科读者李原来信控诉说：他原在德化县民政科工作。一九五一年六月十三日，厦门日报上登载了他批评该县前民政科长孙安国（党员，现任该县副县长）派科内干部并挪用公款到湖南接妻子的错误行为。孙安国就对他施行报复，趁他生病时要调动他的工作，经他在八月十八日厦门日报上揭发，才未成事实。同年十月十二日，孙安国请曾被李原批评而不满的公安局秘书罗金田（党员）等参加民政科“检讨会”，共同斗争李原，并决定撤销其科员职位。十四日晚上，李原又在以县青委名义召开的“反不良倾向大会”上被斗争。过几天，李原就被明令停职反省；到十二月才被调到建设科工作。以上情况，德化县委会都是知道的。“三反”运动中，李原在运动的教育下又积极向县委书记路湘云、公安局长李文华等领导干部提了不少意见，并揭发了孙安国、罗金田等压制批评的行为。不料在
    一九五二年五月“三反”运动检查思想阶段中又被在小组会上斗争，被加上“有计划地打击领导”、“无组织无纪律”等罪名，并据此作了鉴定。李原在
    一九五二年二月间，曾把因写批评信而被打击的情况写信报告毛主席。县委接到中共中央办公厅转嘱调查的信，就让李原所在的团支部调查。全体团员都认为李原控告的是事实；但以后县委却一直没有处理。（编者按：据了解，中共中央办公厅接到李原来信后，在去年三月初即责成晋江地委调查处理，但至今晋江地委尚未把调查和处理的结果上报。）
    原苏南中国人民银行分行读者张牧军来信控诉：前年十二月“三反”运动初期，他给上海解放日报等报纸写信批评该行行长忻元锡挪用公款等问题。去年一月初，他就在小组会上被迫作检查。党员领导干部秘书科科长何辰、文书股股长林茂信、保卫科科长朱君等都说张牧军批评“动机不纯，打击领导，个人出风头”；有的还说这是一个严重的政治性问题。当时贪污分子也趁机破坏，说不愿坦白贪污行为就为了怕被写稿登报。“三反”运动结束后，该行领导干部仍十分歧视张牧军。张牧军思想很痛苦，要求找领导同志谈话，但却无人理睬。有一次他因生病请假找了人事科工资福利股股长吴铁鹏，他想谈谈思想问题，吴铁鹏就讽刺他是“红记者”，并说：“领导上就是不愿意和你谈话！”去年八月张牧军被一些同志提名为工会委员候选人时，文书股股长林茂信就说：“张牧军没向组织上提意见而直接给报纸写批评信，作为一个革命干部来说是不好的，是一种无组织、无纪律的政治性错误！”张牧军为了和领导同志在对待批评问题上取得一致的意见，连续写了十张以上的报告，但问题始终没有得到解决。
    江苏苏州市搬运公司东北区第六中队搬运工人孙凤鸣（青年团员）来信控诉：他曾写信给新苏州报反映搬运公司东北区办事处主任裴月中同志在调配工人时不够公平合理。报社将这封信转请搬运公司经理姜春坤（党员）负责处理。去年九月中，孙凤鸣经工会和青年团组织的同意去投考原苏南技术工人学校，拿了报名单去请姜春坤核准。姜春坤根据报名单的笔迹，对出新苏州报转来对裴月中的批评信是孙凤鸣写的，就拍桌子骂孙凤鸣是“什么东西，”“没有资格去学习，更不够青年团员资格！”最后还说孙凤鸣有“政治问题”，要好好处理。孙凤鸣因此没能去报名学习。
    以上这几个读者在遭受打击后都曾恐惧苦恼，直到看到各地党委和党报处理了一些压制批评的典型事件后，才敢来揭发他们受打击的事实。而另外一位读者写信来反映因为写批评信而被行政领导干部在鉴定上加上“无组织无纪律”一条的情况时，还要求编辑部代他保守秘密，不敢公开他的姓名。
    这种压制批评的现象是令人不能容忍的。尤其值得指出的是，上述读者来信检举的压制批评者大部分是共产党员；问题就更为严重。党再三教育我们：正确地开展自下而上的批评是为了巩固党与人民群众的联系、保障党和国家的民主化、加速社会进步的必要方法。因此，对于人民群众积极性的批评，纵然并非完全正确，也必须采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度；压制批评是一种反党的作风。但是，上面读者所检举的那些压制批评者却完全违反了党的教导。他们一见到群众在报纸上向他们提出批评，就认为有损“尊严”，大为生气，并不惜用开斗争会、强使批评者检查动机、在批评者组织鉴定上乱加“罪状”等非法行为来进行压制和报复。显然，这种错误行为已经严重地损害了党的威信，压抑了群众的积极性，使党和群众的联系受到阻碍。
    这种压制批评的情况在目前所以严重存在，还因为某些党的领导机关对压制批评的行为熟视无睹，不加重视。像福建晋江地委在中共中央办公厅责成他们调查和处理李原所揭发的事实时，就随意把原信转给被批评者——德化县委，再也不问不闻了。这就使得压制批评的违法干部越发大胆，无所顾忌。而某些报纸在处理读者批评信时也有着严重的缺点，没有充分地保障和有力地支持读者积极性的批评，没有和压制批评者作不妥协的斗争；这也使有些压制批评者有机可乘，使很多压制批评事件不能及时被揭发并受到处理。
    必须和压制批评的行为作无情的斗争。各地党委应该反复地向党员进行教育，让他们正确认识开展批评和自我批评的重要政治意义，使他们能用正确的态度来对待批评和自我批评。对于那些压制批评的党员，必须给予严肃的处理。这样，才能使广大群众确知他们的批评能够得到有力的保障和支持，才敢于积极开展自下而上的批评，并坚持和压制批评者进行斗争。本报二十三日发表了“压制批评的人是党的死敌”的社论，希望各级干部认真学习。希望广大读者积极大胆地揭发压制批评的行为，广泛地展开群众性的反对官僚主义的斗争！
