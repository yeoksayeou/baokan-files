    Graft of American Government Officials
    According to American newspapers, the notorious reactionary Senator McCarthy is preparing to summon Truman to court after he steps down to answer questions about his graft.
    But what about McCarthy himself? His hands aren't exactly clean either. According to a Reuters report in early January, the US Senate received a report that he used funds raised under the banner of anti-communism for speculative trading. The report said that McCarthy received a $10,000 check from two people in September 1950 and deposited the money in a bank, but in less than a month, he withdrew the money from the bank to engage in lucrative soybean speculation.
    In fact, they are all the same in a den of vipers!
    Churchill's Entourage Subjected to Examination by American Special Agents
    British Prime Minister Churchill arrived in New York on the ship "Queen Mary" on the 5th of this month. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London, Churchill and his entire entourage were examined on board by US immigration officials under the McCarran Immigration Act. Only Churchill himself was exempt from inspection as a "diplomatic official." Churchill, in answering a reporter's question about this matter, replied: "They told me I had no problems."

    国际简讯
    美国政府官员的贪污
    据美国报纸报道，臭名昭著的反动人物、参议员麦卡锡准备在杜鲁门下台后传讯他到法庭上，要他答复关于他贪污的问题。
    但这位麦卡锡自己呢？手上也不见得干净。据路透社一月初的报道，美国参议院收到一份报告，内中谈到他把打着反共旗子筹集到的款项做投机买卖。报告说，麦卡锡在一九五○年九月由两个人手里得到一万美元的支票，并将该款存入一银行，但不到一个月的工夫，便由银行取出该款从事利润丰厚的大豆投机买卖。
    其实，一窝蛇蝎，都是一样！
    邱吉尔一行受了美国特务的审查
    英国首相邱吉尔本月五日乘坐“玛利皇后号”轮船到了纽约。据法新社伦敦消息透露，邱吉尔一行全体随员在船上曾被美国移民局官员根据麦卡伦移民法进行审查。仅邱吉尔本人以“外交人员”身份免验。邱吉尔在回答新闻记者的关于这一件事情的询问时回答说：“他们告诉我我没有问题。”
