Xinhua News Agency, January 21st:

    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, issues a statement protesting the U.S. government's dispatch of special agent aircraft to intrude into our country's Northeast airspace for strategic reconnaissance:

    On January 12, 1953, at 21:15 local time, a U.S. aircraft invaded the airspace over Andong area in Northeast China. After being engaged by our air force, this invading aircraft was shot down. Eleven U.S. Air Force personnel on board—including Colonel Arnold, commander of the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force—were captured, and the remaining three were killed. This aircraft, number 44-62217, was a B-29 bomber converted for strategic reconnaissance, airdropping special agents, and communication liaison. Its intrusion into our Northeast airspace is clearly a serious provocative act by U.S. imperialism attempting to further conduct sinister strategic reconnaissance against our country in order to expand its war of aggression. The Chinese people express extreme anger at this.

    Encouraged by the illegal Indian proposal passed by the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. government has been intensifying its active planning for expanded war adventures in Asia for the past two months. On the one hand, it continues to slaughter prisoners of war in Korea, continues to wage bacteriological warfare, continues to indiscriminately bomb peaceful residents and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, and unilaterally tears up the agreement on not attacking the supply vehicles of the Korean-Chinese delegations between Pyongyang and Kaesong, attempting to completely sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. On the other hand, it increasingly frequently uses its air force invading Korea to violate Chinese airspace, carrying out bombing and strafing, and slaughtering Chinese people. In the past two months, the U.S. Air Force has invaded our Northeast airspace on November 28, December 8, and December 13, 1952, carrying out bombing, resulting in the death and injury of many of our residents. This time, the U.S. aggressors have even sent special agent aircraft to conduct sinister strategic reconnaissance over Northeast China, attempting to organize sabotage activities within our country to facilitate their military actions for expanding aggression. It can be asserted that this series of crazy conspiracies by the U.S. government to expand the war will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the anger and opposition of the Chinese people. The downing of the U.S. RB-29 aircraft over Andong is a harbinger of this defeat that will inevitably befall the U.S. aggressors.

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the various preparatory steps taken by the U.S. government to expand the Korean War have already formed a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China authorizes me to lodge a strong protest against the serious provocative act of the U.S. government in dispatching special agent aircraft to invade our airspace and conduct strategic reconnaissance, and warns the U.S. government: This series of violent aggressive actions by the U.S. Air Force is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, and the U.S. government must bear absolute responsibility for all the consequences of these aggressive actions.

    周恩来外长发表声明
    抗议美国派遣飞机侵入我国进行战略侦察
     【新华社二十一日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来关于抗议美国政府派遣特务飞机侵入我国东北领空进行战略侦察的声明：
    一九五三年一月十二日当地时间二十一时十五分，美国飞机一架侵入我国东北安东地区领空。经我空军迎击后，这架侵略飞机即被击落，机上美国空军人员十一人——包括美国第十三航空队五八一空中补给通讯联队上校司令官阿诺德在内——被俘，其余三人摔死。这架飞机，号码为四四—六二二一七，是由B—29型轰炸机改装的飞机，是专供战略侦察、空投特务和通讯联络之用的；其侵入我东北领空显然是美国帝国主义企图进一步对我国进行罪恶的战略侦察，以便扩大侵略战争的严重挑衅行为。中国人民对此表示极大的愤怒。
    美国政府在联合国大会非法通过的印度提案的鼓励之下，两月以来，正在变本加厉地积极策划在亚洲从事扩大战争冒险的准备工作。它一方面在朝鲜继续屠杀战俘，继续进行细菌战，继续滥炸朝鲜后方和平居民与和平设备，片面撕毁关于不袭击平壤、开城间朝中代表团供应车辆的协议，企图把朝鲜停战谈判彻底破坏；另一方面则日益频繁地以其侵朝空军侵犯中国领空，施行轰炸扫射，屠杀中国人民。最近两月来，美国空军曾先后于一九五二年十一月二十八日、十二月八日和十二月十三日侵入我国东北领空，施行轰炸，致我国居民死伤多人。这次美国侵略者更派特务飞机到我国东北上空进行罪恶的战略侦察，妄图在我国内部组织破坏活动，以便利它的扩大侵略的军事行动。可以断言，美国政府这一系列扩大战争的疯狂阴谋，在中国人民的愤怒和反对之下，一定要遭受到可耻的失败；在安东上空美国RB—29型飞机之被击落，正是这种失败必将降临到美国侵略者头上的预兆。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，美国政府所采取的各种扩大朝鲜战争的准备步骤，业已形成了对于远东和世界和平的严重威胁。中华人民共和国中央人民政府授权本人对于美国政府这次派遣特务飞机侵犯我国领空、进行战略侦察的严重挑衅行为提出强硬抗议，并警告美国政府：美国空军这种一连串的横暴侵略行动，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的，美国政府对于这种侵略行动的一切后果必须负起绝对的责任。
    一九五三年一月二十一日
