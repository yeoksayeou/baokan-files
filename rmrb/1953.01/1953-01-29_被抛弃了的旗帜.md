    The Abandoned Banner
    Soviet Union Yeshakov
    There was a time when the young bourgeoisie held high the banner of bourgeois-democratic freedom. Lenin said, "To understand the struggle against world capitalism, to understand the essence of capitalist countries, we must know that the wars launched by capitalist countries against feudal countries were launched under the slogan of freedom." The banner of bourgeois-democratic freedom, marked with the words "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," was extremely attractive at that time.

    But now, in a country where factories, banks, and land are the property of the wealthy, what has become of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"? It has become nothing more than hypocritical deception. "Words, words, words," and it was precisely these same words that once enabled the bourgeoisie to gain prestige among the masses. Factory owners, bankers, and landlords are the masters and rulers of bourgeois society, leaving the despoiled in the cities and countryside only to console themselves with the thought that they, too, can breathe the same "free" air and are "equal" to the wealthy in words only.

    Even after the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the bourgeoisie attempted to play their old, worn-out trump card. The warriors of the dollar, the pound, and the franc swore allegiance to freedom, declaring the capitalist world as the "free world." Eisenhower and Truman, Acheson and Dulles, Churchill and Adenauer never tired of shouting these words, and particularly enthusiastic in boasting about the "free world" were the lackeys of the right-wing social democratic parties.

    For them, the "free world" is synonymous with capitalism, that is, enslaving laborers; it is also synonymous with the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which the American imperialists organized as a tool for preparing a new world war in the name of their mad ideal of establishing world hegemony. Isn't this an insult to common sense?

    Let's take a look behind this so-called "free world"!

    Take the United States, for example, whose big bosses consider themselves leaders in this "free world." In this country under extremely reactionary rule, millionaires and billionaires indeed enjoy unlimited freedom to exploit and plunder the people, and they deceive the people for the sake of even greater capitalist profits, driving them towards war. In the words of the American bourgeois writer Washington Irving, money is "the most worshiped thing in the world," and it is even more so now than ever before. Woe to those who do not have huge deposits in the banks!

    In the Morgan-Rockefeller-DuPont empire, the working people have only one right—to serve as human raw material for exploitation. In its frenzied pursuit of maximum profits, Wall Street has stripped the working people of even the meager rights they had gained through long and arduous struggles. The Taft-Hartley Act and other anti-labor laws arbitrarily passed by the U.S. Congress have deprived workers of the right to strike and freely organize trade unions. In recent years, there has not been a single strike of any kind in the United States that has not been subjected to interference by government authorities represented by governors, judges at all levels, or the president himself, clearly speaking on behalf of the capitalists.

    Human rights are being ravaged and trampled upon at will in the world of gold and money, and individual rights are being mocked as never before. The measures taken by the government authorities to shackle ordinary Americans are on par with the barbarism of the Middle Ages. Hundreds of millions of people are forced to undergo humiliating fingerprinting for one thing.

    A series of concentration camps have been established. Camps are located in Tule Lake, California; El Reno, Oklahoma; Avon Park, Florida; Allenwood, Pennsylvania; and Eloy and Florence, Arizona. A reporter from the New York "Compass" vividly described a concentration camp he visited, explaining that the American authorities are imitating Hitler's style in setting up hells. In Washington, everyone knows that the concentration camps are not for the thugs that are everywhere in America, although crime in America is becoming increasingly prevalent and more serious than anywhere else in the world; these concentration camps are for progressive people, labor leaders, and peace fighters.

    Tens of thousands of Americans have been excluded, fired, and deprived of the right to live, simply because Wall Street disapproves of their views. People are arrested, tried, and imprisoned for agreeing with and propagating the scientific principles of Marxism-Leninism, which explain the laws of nature and human social development and are recognized by the civilized world. This is like the Catholic Inquisition persecuting Copernicus, Giordano Bruno, and Galileo, who declared that the Earth revolves around the Sun.

    During the trial of the leaders of the American Communist Party in Foley Square, Judge Medina admitted that he knew nothing about Marxism-Leninism. In an anti-communist trial in California, the prosecutor declared that he did not know the contents of the Marx and Stalin works presented as "evidence" and could only distinguish them by the color of the covers. But the appalling ignorance of the high priests of the American Themis did not prevent them from throwing into prison those with ideals far beyond their comprehension. The ignorant inquisitors of the Middle Ages did the same.

    Political trials in the United States are powerful examples of how the most basic principles of bourgeois law are mocked. All jurors are selected from among those who are prejudiced; defense witnesses are intimidated, threatened, and forbidden to speak; the evidence of the most stupid secret agents is irrefutable, and defendants are sentenced to severe penalties even without the slightest evidence of guilt; especially noteworthy is the fact that the defense lawyer performing his duties is also sent to prison along with the defendant. The tyrannical laws of the dollar are nothing more than a hypocritical deception of the sacred rights of the individual.

    The infamous House Un-American Activities Committee has become the highest spiritual legislator in the United States. It plots the arrest of intellectuals who are actively engaged in opposing extreme reaction and war policies; conducts open spiritual torture of writers, actors, teachers, scientists, government employees, and trade union leaders. The continuous activities of this committee are a terrible event that is an insult to the name of the United States of America.

    When the famous American playwright Lillian Hellman refused to name the communists she knew, the bosses of the committee threatened her. Another playwright, Clifford Odets, lacked the civic courage to resist this pressure and became an informer, but a few days later, this same Odets fainted next to the coffin of John Garfield, an excellent actor who was hunted down by the House Un-American Activities Committee. When the playwright came to, he told the people around him that the committee's persecution had ruined Garfield.

    This is America today!

    In bourgeois America, the terror that surrounds those who are subjected to political persecution also has its economic roots. Steele, a progressive radio broadcaster who was fired like many others, wrote in his diary:

     "According to a rough estimate, I can say that approximately half a million American writers, scientists, artists, doctors, trade union leaders, and general progressives have lost their jobs and are in dire economic straits because they insisted on their opinions, and this number will probably double in the next twelve months."

    In such circumstances, what freedom of speech, publication, assembly, freedom of belief, or other bourgeois-democratic freedoms are there? Journalists, editors, and writers are thrown into prison, members of the clergy who possess progressive publications are fired or blacklisted, and workers who have attended peace conferences or collected signatures for the Stockholm Appeal calling for a ban on the use of atomic weapons are deprived of their livelihoods.

    So-called "individual freedom" no longer exists in the world of gold and money. But those who own capital enjoy all the rights and freedoms.

    Suppose a drunk broke into Rockefeller's mansion and beat up his little daughter. Then, the defenders of bourgeois law and order would be very strong against this perpetrator! The newspapers would inevitably roar! The person who violated the sacred rights of the Rockefeller family would immediately be locked up in Sing Sing Prison.

    But when a drunken secret agent named Beck broke into the home of Robert James, a lawyer defending a Communist leader, and attempted to rape James' young daughter, causing the girl severe fright, nothing happened. The perpetrator left calmly, and society caused not the slightest disturbance. The matter was covered up and forgotten.

    This shows that unequal rights are an unwritten law in the United States. Mr. Rockefeller has one set of rights, while ordinary Americans like James have another set.

    "Everyone has equal rights, no one has privileges." Thomas Jefferson, the main author of the American Declaration of Independence, once said this.

    In the United States, not only individual equality but even national equality is wantonly trampled upon. The remnants of the Native Americans, who were once a thriving race, are living in designated areas and are on the verge of extinction. This is the most obvious example of collective extermination. Other victims of collective extermination are the fifteen million Black Americans. It is very common for a lynching mob, a domineering policeman, or just an occasional passerby to kill Black people.

    The nearly extinct Red Indians and a group of Black leaders have repeatedly filed complaints with the United Nations organization about the racial discrimination prevalent in the United States, but to no avail. In addition to Indians and Black people, Jews, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and other minorities also suffer from racial discrimination.

    This is Truman and Eisenhower's "free world."

    Gold-money imperialism is also cultivating the same shameless reactionary forces in its servant countries, establishing police terror rule against progressive groups everywhere, plotting the persecution of leaders of progressive groups, and constantly employing professional murderers to carry out its orders.

    The electoral law frauds in Western European countries are the most obvious portrayal of the lack of rights of the vast exploited in bourgeois society.

    In the past, the bourgeoisie was still able to deceive liberals. It announced the principle of universal suffrage and repeatedly praised it. There was also the constant portrayal of proportional representation as the greatest achievement.

    How many sweet words the working people have heard about this! They have been repeatedly told that with universal suffrage and proportional representation, there is no need to rely on revolutionary action. It is enough to elect appropriate people to the parliament, and since the working people are the majority of the population, they will certainly be able to ensure a majority parliament. The leaders of social democratic parties, from Kautsky to Blum, were particularly eloquent in defending this. At that time, the bourgeoisie was trying to maintain contact with the people, and the social democratic parties echoed, attempting to gain prestige among the masses.

    To quote an old Latin proverb: Times change, and the bourgeoisie changes with them. Due to the active activities of the Communist Party and democratic parties for a long time, an alliance of many advanced people who resolutely defend the interests of the working people has won seats in the parliaments of several Western European countries. As a result, the bourgeoisie has abandoned proportional representation and replaced it with a majority system, which is nothing more than a trick whose sole purpose is to deprive the representatives of the working people of all or part of their seats in the parliament.

    One of the best examples of the implementation of this system is the recent election in the Greek parliament. Even in the elections held under bloody terror, the left-wing parties still received more than ten percent of the total votes, but did not get a single seat. What is this if not a despicable fraud? And there are some hired writers in capitalist newspapers who fabricate articles talking about the "failure of the left" in the Greek elections!

    Therefore, the rulers of capitalist countries themselves are exposing the true nature of the bourgeois parliamentary system, fully telling the people that the parliamentary system is just a lie and deception.

    The people can personally see that even the slightest shadow of the bourgeoisie's past liberalism cannot be found now.

    Life itself shows that in our time, the bourgeoisie has lost contact with the people and has also lost the trust of the people. Mao Zedong, the leader of the new China, quoted a famous saying of Confucius in one of his works: "A man cannot stand without faith." So what is there to say about a class that has lost the trust of the people?

    Joseph Stalin recently said the following to the representatives of fraternal parties in bourgeois countries in his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The banner of bourgeois democratic freedom has been thrown aside. I believe that it is you, the representatives of the communist and democratic parties, who must raise this banner and move forward under it, if you want to gather the majority of the people around you. No one else will raise this banner except you."

    The banner of bourgeois-democratic freedom that has been abandoned by the bourgeoisie is now being held high by reliable hands, who will confidently hold it towards a system that will guarantee the true freedom of society, while destroying all oppression and exploitation of man by man.

    被抛弃了的旗帜
    苏联  叶沙可夫
    有一个时期，年青的资产阶级高举过资产阶级—民主自由的旗帜。列宁说过：“要了解反对世界资本主义的斗争，要了解资本主义国家的本质，我们必须知道，资本主义国家进攻封建主义国家的战争是在自由的口号下发动的。”标上了“自由、平等、博爱”字样的资产阶级—民主自由的旗帜，在那个时候是有极大的吸引力的。
    但是现在在工厂、银行和土地都是富翁们的财产的一个国家里面，“自由、平等、博爱”成了什么呢？成了一种虚伪的欺骗，除此而外再没有什么了。“字眼、字眼、字眼”，而正是这些同样的字眼曾一度使资产阶级在人民群众中获得威望。工厂主、银行家和地主是资产阶级社会的主人和统治者，留下给城市和乡村中的被掠夺者的，是他们也可以呼吸同样的“自由”空气，并在口头上与富翁们“平等”，他们只能以此聊以自慰。
    甚至在苏联社会主义胜利之后，资产阶级还企图玩弄他们的这一张陈腐不堪的老王牌。美元、英镑和法郎的勇士们，宣誓忠诚于自由，把资本主义世界宣称为“自由世界”。艾森豪威尔和杜鲁门，艾奇逊和杜勒斯，邱吉尔和阿登纳从不倦于叫嚣这些字眼，而特别热中于夸耀“自由世界”的，是资产阶级右翼社会党的走狗们。
    对于他们来说，“自由世界”是资本主义的同义字，就是奴役劳动者；也就是北大西洋侵略集团的同义字，美帝国主义者以建立世界霸权的疯狂理想为名，组织了这个集团作为准备新的世界战争的工具。这不是对普通常识的一种侮辱吗？
    让我们看看这个所谓“自由世界”的背后吧！
    拿美国来说，它的大老板在这个“自由世界”中自居领导地位。在这个极端反动统治下的国家里，百万富翁和亿万富翁的确享有剥削和掠夺人民的无限自由，他们并且为了更庞大的资本主义利润而欺骗人民，把他们驱向战争。用美国资产阶级作家华盛顿·伊尔文的话来说，钱是“全世界所最受崇拜的东西”，现在比以前任何时候更加是如此了，在银行里没有巨额存款的人就该倒霉！
    在摩根—洛克菲勒—杜邦帝国里，劳动人民只有一种权利——作为人类原料以供剥削。华尔街在猛烈追求最大限度的利润中，把劳动人民过去长期艰苦斗争所得来的极少的一点权利也剥夺殆尽，美国国会随意通过的塔夫脱法案和别的一些反劳工法案，剥夺了工人们罢工和自由组织工会的权利。近年来在美国就没有过一次任何性质的罢工不遭受以州长、各级法官或总统本人为代表的政府当局的干涉，显然他们是替资方说话的。
    人权在金元世界遭受摧残，被任意践踏，个人权利受到从来未有过的愚弄。政府当局为了束缚普通美国人民而采取的措施，与中世纪的野蛮行为不相上下。为了一件事情，就有好几百万人被迫进行屈辱的指纹登记。
    一连串的集中营建立起来，在加利福尼亚州的土尔湖、俄克拉何马州的艾尔伦诺、弗罗里达州的亚王公园、宾夕凡尼亚州的阿楞坞及亚里桑那州的魏肯伯和弗洛伦斯，都设有集中营。纽约“指南针日报”的一位记者有声有色地描述了他所参观过的一个集中营，说明美国当局正在仿效希特勒的样式设立地狱。在华盛顿人人都知道，集中营并不是为美国到处皆有的匪徒而设的，虽然美国的犯罪行为正日益普遍流行，比世界上任何地方都厉害；这些集中营是为进步人士、工人领袖和和平战士设立的。
    成千成万的美国人民被排斥、被解雇，被剥夺了生活权利，都只是因为华尔街不赞成他们的观点。人民由于同意和宣传马克思—列宁主义的科学原则而被逮捕、审讯、下狱。而马克思—列宁主义阐释了自然和人类社会发展的规律，已为文明世界所公认。这就好像天主教的异教裁判所迫害宣布地球是围绕太阳而旋转的哥白尼、吉尔旦诺、布鲁诺和迦利略一样。
    在福莱广场对美国共产党领袖的审讯中，麦迪纳法官承认他对马克思—列宁主义一无所知。在一次加利福尼亚的反共审讯中，检察官宣布他根本不知道那些被提出为“证据”的马克思和斯大林著作的内容，而只能根据封面的颜色来辨别。但是美国的德米士（译注：希腊神话中司法律的女神）的大祭司的惊人的无知，并未能阻止他们把那些具有远非他们所能领悟的理想的人们投入监狱。中世纪无知的异教裁判者也作过同样的事情。
    在美国的政治审判就是有力的例证，说明资产阶级法律的最基本的原则是如何地被嘲弄。全体陪审官都是从那些有偏见的人中挑选来的；辩护的证人被恐赫、威胁和禁止发言，那些最愚蠢的特务的证据却不容辩驳，被告没有丝毫罪证也被判处重刑；尤其特殊的是履行职务的辩护律师也竟和被告一同被送入监狱。美元的暴虐法律不过是对个人的神圣权利的虚伪欺骗。
    臭名昭著的非美活动委员会已变成了美国最高的精神上的立法者，它策划逮捕那些积极从事反对极端反动和战争政策的知识分子；对作家、演员、教员和科学家、政府职员和工会领袖等进行公开的精神拷问，它的连续不断的活动的可怖的事件，是对美利坚合众国这个名字的一种污辱。
    著名的美国剧作家赫尔曼拒绝说出她所知道的共产党员时，委员会的老板就威吓她。另一位剧作家奥德斯缺乏反抗这种压力的公民勇气，而成了告密者，但是在数天之后，就是这一个奥德斯，晕倒在加尔费尔德的棺材旁边，加尔费尔德是被非美活动委员会搜捕的一个优秀演员。这位剧作家清醒过来后，向周围的人们说：委员会的迫害把加尔费尔德毁了。
    这就是今天的美国！
    在资产阶级的美国，这种笼罩着遭受政治迫害的人们的恐怖，也是有其经济根源的。和其他许多人
    一样被解雇的进步的无线电广播员斯梯尔在他的日记上写着：
     “根据粗略的估计，我可以说大概有五十万美国的作家、科学家、艺术家、医生、工会领袖和一般进步人士由于坚持他们的意见而失了业，并且陷于经济毁灭的困境，在以后的十二个月中，这个数字大概会增加一倍。”
    在这样的情况下还有什么言论、出版和集会自由、信仰自由或别的资产阶级—民主自由呢？记者、编辑和作家被投进监狱，持有进步出版物的公教人员被开除或被录入黑名单，参加过和平会议或为号召禁止使用原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言征集过签名的工人被剥夺了生计。
    所谓“个人自由”已不复存在于金圆世界了。但是那些拥有资本的人享有着一切的权利和自由。
    假设有一次一个醉汉闯入洛克菲勒的华厦，殴打他的小女儿。那么，资产阶级法律和秩序的保卫者对于这位肇事者可有劲了！报纸也必然会大肆咆哮！这个侵犯洛克菲勒家庭神圣权利的人立刻会被关进辛辛监狱。
    但是当一个喝醉酒的名叫卑克的特务破门闯入共产党领袖的辩护律师罗勃特·詹姆生的家中，企图强奸詹姆生的幼女，使那个女孩子受到极严重的惊吓，却什么事也不会有。行凶者从容而去，社会上没有引起半点骚动。这件事就被掩盖和遗忘了。
    这说明不平等权利在美国是一种不成文法。洛克菲勒先生有一套权利，像詹姆生这样的一般美国人有的却是另外的一套。
    “大家都有平等的权利，谁也没有特权。”美国独立宣言的主要执笔者汤姆士·杰弗逊曾经这样说过。
    在美国不仅个人的平等而且连民族的平等也被肆意践踏。那曾经是种族繁衍的印第安人的遗族，正住在被圈定的地区濒于灭种，这是集体屠杀最明显的例证。集体屠杀的另一些牺牲者是美国的一千五百万黑人。一个用私刑的暴徒，一个狐假虎威的警察、或仅仅是一个偶尔过路的人，杀死黑人是很平常的事情。
    快绝种的红印第安人和一群黑人领袖曾多次对美国流行的种族歧视向联合国组织提出控诉，但毫无结果。除了印第安人和黑人之外，犹太人、墨西哥人、波多黎各人和其他少数民族，也遭受种族歧视之害。
    这就是杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔的“自由世界”。
    金圆帝国主义也正在它的仆从国家培植同样无耻的反动势力，到处建立反对进步团体的警察恐怖统治，并策划对进步团体的领袖的迫害，不断地雇用职业杀人犯来执行它的命令。
    西欧国家的选举法的骗局是资产阶级社会中广大的被剥削者毫无权利的最明显的写照。
    以前，资产阶级还能够愚弄自由主义者。它宣布普选权的原则，并一再加以颂扬。还有就是经常把比例代表制说成是最大的成就。
    劳动人民听了他们多少关于这方面的甜言蜜语啊！他们一再被告诉说有了普选权和比例代表制就不需要靠革命行动了。只要选举适当的人到议会就成，而且既然劳动人民是人口中的多数，他们就一定能保证有一个占多数的议会。社会民主党的领袖们，从考茨基到勃鲁姆，特别在这方面口若悬河似地进行辩护。那时候是资产阶级正想设法维持和人民的联系，社会民主党就随声附和，企图在广大群众中获得威信。
    引一句古老的拉丁谚语来说：时代变了，资产阶级也随着变了。由于长久以来共产党和民主党派的积极活动，很多坚决维护劳动人民利益的先进人们的联盟在若干西欧国家的议会中取得了席位。于是资产阶级就废弃了比例代表制，而代之以一种多数制，而这种多数制只不过是一种骗术，其唯一的目的，就是要剥夺劳动人民的代表在议会中的全部或一部分的议席。
    这项制度的施行的一个最好的例子，就是最近希腊议会的选举。即使在血腥的恐怖下举行的选举中，左翼政党仍然获得超过总票数百分之十的选票，但是没有得到一个议席。这不是一种卑劣的骗局是什么？而还有些受雇佣的文人在资本家的报纸上捏造一些文章大谈其希腊选举中“左派失败”！
    因此，资本主义国家的统治者本身正在暴露资产阶级议会制度的真实性质，充分地告诉民众，议会制度只是谎言和欺骗。
    人民可以亲自看到现在连资产阶级过去的自由主义的一点影子都找不到了。
    生活本身就显示出，在我们的时代中，资产阶级已经失去了与人民的联系，同时也失去了人民的信任。新中国的领袖毛泽东在他的一部著作中引用了孔子的一句名言：“人无信不立”。因此一个已失却人民信任的阶级还有什么值得说的呢？
    约瑟夫·斯大林最近在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的演说中对资产阶级国家兄弟党的代表们说过如下的话：“资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了。我认为，正是你们，共产主义和民主的政党的代表们，必须举起这面旗帜，打着这面旗帜前进，如果你们愿意把大多数人民集合在自己周围的话。除了你们以外，再没有人会举起这面旗帜了。”
    已经为资产阶级所抛弃了的这面资产阶级—民主的自由的旗帜，现在正由可靠的手继续高举着，他们将满怀信心地举着它向着一种制度前进，这种制度将保障社会的真正自由，同时要摧毁一切人对人的压迫和剥削。（孟洪定、朱钦儒译自苏联“新时代”一九五二年第四十九期）
