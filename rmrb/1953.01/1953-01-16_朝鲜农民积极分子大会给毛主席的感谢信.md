(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th) The Korean National Farmers' Activists Congress wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong expressing their gratitude. The letter said:

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong! In the flames of the just Fatherland Liberation War to defend the freedom, independence and honor of our country and to oppose the American aggressors and their running dogs, we, the participants of the National Farmers' Activists Congress of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, would like to express our deepest gratitude and warmest congratulations to you, our respected leader, and through you to the fraternal Chinese people.

The American and British imperialist armed aggressors, in an attempt to turn our country into their colony and military base and to provoke a new war in Asia, launched a brutal war of aggression against our country, which has now entered its fourth year. Last year, the enemy carried out devastating bombings of our peaceful cities and villages, massacred large numbers of our innocent parents, brothers and wives, and even used bacteriological weapons, bombing our power plants and cutting off water for irrigation facilities, in an attempt to turn our rear into an abyss of hunger, disease and death.

We Korean farmers did not succumb to any of the enemy's atrocities. We overcame all difficulties and rose up together to increase agricultural production. As a result, we achieved a bumper harvest rarely seen in decades.

In our just struggle against the common enemy of the people of Korea and China – the American armed aggressors – the great Chinese people under your leadership, holding high the banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend the Nation," sent their beloved sons and daughters to the Korean battlefield, and when we were in a difficult situation with food, sent us tens of thousands of tons of grain and food.

The incomparably heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, in the fierce battle environment of eliminating and sweeping away the American armed aggressors together with our Korean People's Army, not only demonstrated unparalleled heroism and indomitable tenacity and made great and outstanding achievements, but also saved grain and shared it with us Korean farmers, and used the gaps after completing combat missions to help us labor and help us increase grain production. This is a true manifestation of the proletarian internationalism of the great Chinese people, and a demonstration of the brotherly friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China forged in history.

Today, the American armed aggressors, disregarding the ardent desire for peace of the people of Korea and China and the peace-loving people of the world, are doing everything possible to frantically sabotage the armistice negotiations, and to further prolong and expand the Korean War.

However, the Korean people, tempered in the just struggle to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland, are capable of coping with any long-term war conspiracy of the enemy, capable of fighting to the end, and are determined to completely defeat and smash any aggressive attempt of the enemy.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong: We Korean farmers, following the instructions of our respected leader General Kim Il-sung: "The struggle for food is the struggle for the motherland," will spare no effort to ensure that no inch of land is left uncultivated and that more grain is produced. We will widely use advanced farming methods to ensure higher yields this year. We will devote all our enthusiasm and strength to further cherish and support the heroic People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers.

For the glorious victory of the people of Korea and China and the prosperity and development of the People's Republic of China and lasting peace in Asia, we wish you, our respected leader, a long life.

    朝鲜农民积极分子大会给毛主席的感谢信
    【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜全国农民积极分子大会写信给毛泽东主席表示感谢。信中说：
    敬爱的毛泽东主席！在保卫我们祖国的自由独立和荣誉、反对美国侵略者及其走狗的正义的祖国解放战争的火焰中，出席朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全国农民积极分子大会的我们，谨向敬爱的您、并通过您向兄弟般的中国人民致深深的感谢和热烈的祝贺。
    美英帝国主义武装侵略者为了企图把我们祖国变为它的殖民地和军事基地并在亚洲挑拨新战争，发动了对我们祖国的野兽般的侵略战争，这个战争现在已进入第四年了。敌人在去年曾对我们的和平城市和农村肆行毁灭性的轰炸，大量地屠杀我们无辜的父母兄弟和妻子，甚至于使用了细菌武器，轰炸了我们的发电厂，中断灌溉设备的用水，企图把我们后方造成饥饿疾病和死亡的深渊。
    我们朝鲜农民没有在敌人任何暴行面前屈服。我们克服了一切困难，一致奋起进行农业增产，结果，我们获得了数十年来少有的大丰收。
    在我们反对朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美国武装侵略者的正义斗争中，您所领导的伟大的中国人民，高举着“抗美援朝保家卫国”的旗帜，把自己的亲爱的儿女派到朝鲜战场，并在我们粮食情况困难的时期，给我们送来了数万吨粮食和食物。
    英勇无比的中国人民志愿军，在和我们朝鲜人民军一道消灭和扫荡美国武装侵略者的激烈战斗环境中，不但发挥了无比的英雄主义和不屈不挠的顽强性，建立了巨大的卓著的功勋，而且，节省出粮食，分给我们朝鲜农民，利用完成战斗任务后的空隙，帮助我们劳动，帮助我们增产粮食。这是伟大的中国人民的无产阶级国际主义的真正表现，是朝中两国人民在历史上结成的兄弟般的友谊团结的示威。
    今天，美国武装侵略者无视朝中两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民对和平的热烈愿望，在千方百计地疯狂地破坏停战谈判，进一步延长和扩大朝鲜战争。
    但是，在捍卫自己祖国的独立自由的正义斗争中锻炼出来的朝鲜人民，能够对付敌人任何长期战争的阴谋，能够战斗到底，并一定要彻底击破和粉碎敌人的任何侵略企图。
    尊敬的毛泽东主席：我们朝鲜农民遵循着我们敬爱的领袖金日成将军的指示：“为食粮的斗争，就是为祖国的斗争”，将为不荒一寸土地，增产更多的粮食而尽一切努力。我们将广泛地运用先进的农作方法，保证在今年获得更高的产量。我们要尽一切热情和力量，进一步爱护和支援英雄的人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军。
    为了朝中两国人民的光辉胜利和中华人民共和国的隆盛发展及亚洲的持久和平，谨祝敬爱的您万寿无疆。
