Xinhua News Agency, 28th—In order to plan new military adventures, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins arrived in Korea on the 26th along with Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Korea, Clark. Collins will hold a series of meetings with Van Fleet, who has been relieved of his command of the Eighth Army, and other senior U.S. military commanders. Although Collins pretended that his trip to Korea was only a "routine, regular visit," the Associated Press revealed that Collins' trip to Korea was related to the U.S. aggressors' active deployment to expand the war of aggression. The Associated Press reported from Seoul that "Collins' arrival in Korea at a time when battlefield commanders are being replaced may have a great impact on the Korean War situation." The Associated Press also quoted so-called Seoul "observers" as saying that "this may be the beginning of President Eisenhower's plan to resolve the war stalemate with 'action rather than words.'"

    美陆军参谋长柯林斯和克拉克
    到朝鲜布置新军事冒险
    【新华社二十八日讯】为了布置新的军事冒险，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯已在二十六日和侵朝美军总司令克拉克一道到达朝鲜。柯林斯将要和已被撤销第八军军长职务的范佛里特以及其他美军高级指挥官举行一连串会议。虽然柯林斯装假说他这次来朝鲜只是一种“例行的、定期的访问”，但是合众社却透露了柯林斯的朝鲜之行与美国侵略者积极部署扩大侵略战争有关。合众社从汉城报道说，“柯林斯正当撤换战地司令的时候到朝鲜来，对于朝鲜战局可能会有很大的影响。”合众社并引用所谓汉城
    “观察家”的话说，“这可能是实行艾森豪威尔总统的‘用行动而不是用言词’解决战争僵持局面计划开始的信号。”
