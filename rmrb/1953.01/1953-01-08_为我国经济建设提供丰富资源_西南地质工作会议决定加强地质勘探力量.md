To Provide Abundant Resources for China's Economic Construction
Southwest Geological Work Conference Decides to Strengthen Geological Exploration Forces
Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau Discovers More Than 3,000 Mineral Outcrops; Mineral Reserves in the Longyan Iron Ore Area are Several Times Higher Than Original Data
    The Southwest Geological Bureau convened a geological work conference in mid-December last year. Based on the spirit of Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech at the National Geological Work Conference, the conference focused on discussing how to overcome the difficulties of having large tasks but limited resources. In the past, the Southwest Geological Bureau had shortcomings in the rational use of geological talent. For example, eight geological workers were assigned to library management, procurement, and transportation, and some technical cadres also performed administrative work, which prevented concentration of forces. In light of these circumstances, the conference decided to first adjust cadres, assigning more than 95% of technical cadres to field geological work positions, and also planned to transfer more than 100 veteran cadres to take on major administrative work. To increase new strength, the conference decided to run training courses in a planned manner in 1953. Currently, the Southwest Geological Bureau has already started drilling personnel training courses and geological personnel training courses, with a total of more than 1,000 students. In 1953, the number of students and the scope of teaching will be further expanded. Many technicians guaranteed at the meeting that each of them would train at least three apprentices in 1953. Departments such as drafting and chemical testing are also prepared to absorb a large number of new cadres to participate in the work, in order to cultivate six to ten times more new technical talents than the current number of people.
    Regarding how to improve the abilities of existing geological personnel, the representatives at the meeting thoroughly discussed the three learning methods instructed by Vice Premier Chen Yun. Most technicians reviewed their past errors of arrogance and mutual disdain and assured that they would learn from each other with humility and strengthen unity in the future. Many technicians strictly criticized the idea of blindly worshiping British and American technology and proposed specific measures for learning advanced Soviet technology in the future. The technical personnel of the geological group decided that each person would study an advanced Soviet working method and, after successful research and experimentation, would give lectures to each other.
    Through this conference, the cadres of the Southwest Geological Bureau greatly improved their ideological understanding and confidence in completing tasks. Each field work team and each department made guarantees at the meeting to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the central government in 1953. Old technicians who had been doing indoor work for a long time also actively strived to participate in field geological work. Le Senxun, an old engineer in his fifties, said in his speech: "For the needs of national construction, I request to be assigned to work in difficult areas for exploration work."
    Furthermore, the Northeast Industrial Department's Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau used mobile mineral outcrop investigation teams to mobilize the masses to actively report mineral discoveries, which has achieved good results. In the past two years, the mineral outcrop investigation teams have relied on the strength of the masses in the three provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe to discover more than 3,000 mineral outcrops, of which more than 100 have been identified as having mining value.
    In the spring of 1951, the bureau accepted the suggestion of Soviet geological expert Biemas and established twelve mobile mineral outcrop investigation teams in its affiliated mines. Each team consisted of four to six people, and the team members were all workers with mining experience and local educated youth who had undergone short-term training. Every time they went to a village, they took the initiative to contact the village cadres, combined with the central work of the rural areas to convene village cadre meetings and mass meetings, publicized the significance of mass reporting of mineral discoveries, and understood the local rock and ore conditions. In the past two years, the investigation teams have convened a total of more than 600 mass meetings with more than 100 people. The experience of the investigation teams proves that the broad masses who love the motherland after liberation, as long as they understand the significance of reporting mineral discoveries, can actively assist the investigation teams in their work. For example, Yang Zhanshan, a farmer in Jinxi County, Liaoxi Province, dug up a pile of metal ore ten years ago and kept it hidden at home. After hearing the publicity about reporting mineral discoveries, the next morning he carried more than 100 kilograms of metal specimens from 30 miles away to the investigation team's camp, and then led the investigation team to climb mountains and ridges to survey the site where the ore was discovered and the surrounding areas, finally discovering a metal deposit.
    In addition to giving oral publicity to the masses, the mineral outcrop investigation teams also carried a large number of publicity charts and mineral specimens to hold small-scale exhibitions in the villages to increase the masses' interest and knowledge of mineral resources. This method has played a great role in promoting mass reporting of mineral discoveries. Xing Wenguo and Liu Chunyou, farmers in Tieling County, found some ore on the mountain after visiting the exhibition, which was similar to one of the ores on display. Therefore, the two took specimens and took a train to Shenyang City to report to the Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau.
    Before leaving a village, the mineral outcrop investigation teams must post many publicity materials for reporting mineral discoveries and the reward methods formulated by the bureau in places where the masses gather, and take the initiative to find local activists for reporting mineral discoveries or village cadres to serve as mineral information reporters, so that the mineral outcrop investigation teams can get timely feedback when mineral outcrops are discovered in various places.
    Based on these experiences, the Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau has established a geological survey school to train a large number of mineral outcrop investigation team members. After graduation, they are prepared to go to various places in Northeast China to universally mobilize the masses to report mineral discoveries, in order to facilitate the national resource survey work.
    Furthermore, the geological survey of the Longyan Iron Ore Area in North China has ended, and it has been preliminarily confirmed that the mineral reserves are several times higher than the original data.
    In order to provide resources for the development of China's steel industry, the central geological department sent a geological survey team to the mining area in May 1952 to undertake resource survey work. The geological personnel and surveying personnel who participated in the work did not avoid hardship and displayed a high degree of enthusiasm. They often went up the mountain under the stars and only returned in the dark. They only ate some dry food on the mountain at noon, and they persisted in working even in heavy snow, and finally successfully completed the geological survey task. This work has been actively supported by the local people, and many farmers have automatically led the geological staff, and vacated their houses for them to live in. In order to provide various accurate indicators such as quantity and quality for the design of new mines, the mining area is conducting various preparatory projects such as erecting high-voltage power lines, laying water pipes, building offices, dormitories, and stabilizing drilling rigs according to the survey conclusions. A larger-scale detailed geological survey work of drilling, trenching, grooving, and physical prospecting will be fully launched.

    为我国经济建设提供丰富资源
    西南地质工作会议决定加强地质勘探力量
    东北有色金属管理局发现矿苗三千多处，龙烟铁矿区矿藏量比原有资料数字多几倍
    西南地质局在去年十二月中旬召开了地质工作会议。根据陈云副总理在全国地质工作会议上的讲话的精神，会议着重讨论了如何克服任务大、力量小的困难问题。西南地质局过去在合理使用地质人才方面曾存在着缺点，如有八个地质工作人员被分配作图书管理、采购、转运等工作，有些技术干部兼作行政工作，使力量不能集中。根据这些情况，会议决定首先调整干部，把百分之九十五以上的技术干部，分配到野外地质工作岗位上去，另外准备调一百多名老干部担负主要行政工作。为了增加新的力量，会议决定在一九五三年有计划地开办训练班。目前，西南地质局已经开办了钻探人员训练班和地质人员训练班，共有学员一千多名，一九五三年学员人数和教学范围都要更加扩大。许多技术人员在会上保证一九五三年每人至少带出三个徒弟。绘图、化验等部门也准备大量吸收新干部参加工作，以便培养出六倍到十倍于现有人数的新技术人才。
    对于如何提高现有地质人员的本领问题，到会代表深入讨论了陈云副总理指示的三种学习方法。大多数技术人员都检查了过去自高自大，彼此看不起的错误思想，保证今后互相虚心学习，加强团结。许多技术人员严格批判了盲目崇拜英美技术的思想，并提出今后学习苏联先进技术的具体办法。地质组技术人员决定每人钻研一种苏联先进工作法，待研究试验成功后，彼此进行讲授。
    通过这次会议，西南地质局干部大大提高了思想认识和完成任务的信心。各野外工作队、各部门都在会上提出保证完成中央分配的一九五三年的光荣任务。过去长期作室内工作的老技术人员，也都主动地争取参加野外地质工作。五十多岁的老工程师乐森浔在发言时说：“为了国家建设的需要，我要求分配到艰苦的地区作探勘工作。”
    又讯：东北工业部有色金属管理局运用流动的矿苗调查队发动群众积极报矿，收到很好的效果。两年来，矿苗调查队在辽东、辽西、热河三省依靠群众力量，已发现矿苗三千多处，其中已经判明有采矿价值的达一百多处。
    一九五一年春，该局接受苏联地质专家别马斯的建议，在所属各矿山建立了十二个流动的矿苗调查队，每队人数四人到六人，队员都是经过短期训练的有采矿经验的工人和当地知识青年。他们每到一个乡村，就主动地和村干部联系，结合农村中心工作召开村干部会议和群众大会，宣传群众报矿的意义，了解当地岩石和矿石的情况。调查队在两年来，一共召开了六百多次一百人以上的群众大会。调查队的经验证明：解放后热爱祖国的广大群众，只要明了报矿意义，都能积极协助调查队进行工作。如辽西省锦西县农民杨占山在十年前掘出了一堆金属矿石，一直藏在家里，听了报矿宣传以后，第二天一清早，就背着一百多斤重的金属标本从三十里路外送到调查队的宿营地，接着又领调查队员翻山越岭去勘测发现矿石的现场和附近地区，终于发现了一个金属矿床。
    矿苗调查队除向群众作口头宣传外，还携带了大批宣传图表和矿石标本在乡村举行小型展览会，以提高群众对矿藏的兴趣和知识。这个办法对推动群众报矿起了很大作用。铁岭县农民邢文国和刘春友参观展览会以后，在山上发现了一些矿石，和展览的一种矿石相似，于是，两人就带了标本，坐火车到沈阳市，报告给东北有色金属管理局。
    矿苗调查队在离开一个乡村以前，一定在群众集中的地点张贴许多报矿宣传品和该局制订的报矿提奖办法，并主动找当地报矿积极分子或村干部担任矿情报告员，以便各地发现矿苗时，矿苗调查队能及时得到反映。
    根据这些经验，东北有色金属管理局已举办地质勘测学校，培养大批矿苗调查队队员。准备学成后到东北各地普遍发动群众报矿，以利于国家资源调查工作的进行。
    又讯：华北龙烟铁矿区的地质普查工作已经结束，初步证实矿藏量要比原有资料数字多好几倍。
    为了给我国钢铁工业的发展提供资源，一九五二年五月，中央地质部门就派出地质勘测队到该矿区担任资源勘测工作。参加工作的地质人员和测量人员，不避艰苦，发挥了高度的积极性。他们经常顶着星星上山，摸黑才回来，中午只在山上吃些干粮，即使在大雪天也坚持工作，终于胜利完成了地质普查的任务。这次工作受到当地人民群众的积极支持，许多农民都自动地给地质工作人员带路，给他们腾房子住。为了给新矿山的设计提供数量、质量等各种精确的指标，该矿区正根据普查结论，紧张地进行架设高压电线，铺设自来水管，建筑办公室、宿舍以及稳装钻塔等各项准备工程。一个更大规模的钻探、坑探、槽探、物理探矿等地质详查工作，就要全面展开。
