    Expose the Crimes of American Bacterial Warfare Criminals to the People of the World
    Shi Dongshan, Chief Editor of the Film "Oppose Bacteriological Warfare"
    "Oppose Bacteriological Warfare" is a large-scale documentary. It is a true record of the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare on the Korean battlefield and in Northeast China. It also reflects the powerful strength of the Korean and Chinese people in defending against bacteriological warfare and the glorious victory of the struggle against bacteriological warfare.

    The crimes of American imperialists in carrying out bacteriological warfare shocked and angered the Chinese and Korean film workers. In order to defend human civilization and security, we felt that we must use the powerful tool of film to expose the crimes of bacterial warfare criminals to the people of the world.

    The American government had long prepared for the heinous bacteriological warfare. Not long after the flames of World War II were extinguished, the American government spread reactionary ideas of bacteriological warfare everywhere through various reactionary newspapers and magazines. They even used cartoons of "bacterial weapons mocking atomic weapons" to arrogantly promote the "power" of bacterial weapons. Many reactionary newspapers and magazines in the United States have publicly reported that there are bacterial testing grounds near Washington, as well as in Pascagoula, Dugway, and other cities. As early as March 12, 1949, the then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal publicly clamored that they would use bacterial weapons if the situation required it.

    After suffering repeated defeats on the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors brazenly violated international law and disregarded human dignity by using bacteriological weapons in Korea and then in Northeast China, widely spreading deadly germs. When you witness the heartbroken lament of Mrs. Han of Pyongyang City, recounting how the germs produced by the American bacterial warfare criminals killed her husband and two lively grandsons, and all the crimes of the American bacterial warfare criminals, how can you suppress your anger?

    The American war criminals who spread germs have truly become the most vicious public enemies of mankind. Their cruel intentions have far surpassed those of their predecessor, the fascist leader Hitler. They originally thought that this would make the Korean and Chinese people fear and shrink back, but this was entirely their dream. The criminal acts of American imperialism ignited the raging fire of anger in the people of China and Korea. A strong people's epidemic prevention team was organized, and a large number of disinfection equipment and medicines were transported to the affected areas. Patriotic scientists and medical and health workers went to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare one after another... The people's strong will and effective epidemic prevention measures controlled the poisonous insects and poisonous substances spread by the United States and prevented the spread of the epidemic.

    Countries around the world have issued condemnations against the U.S. government for carrying out bacteriological warfare, and voices of justice have come from all corners. Masses in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, and other countries held demonstrations against the U.S. carrying out bacteriological warfare. Fair-minded newspapers in the United States also exposed the U.S. government's responsibility for carrying out bacteriological warfare; fair-minded newspapers in the United Kingdom, France, India, and Australia unanimously severely condemned the U.S. government's brutal behavior. The criminal acts of American imperialism have made it even more isolated in front of the people of the world, which will inevitably accelerate its failure.

    We have faithfully filmed all of this. This film also records: many on-site situations where American imperialism spread bacterial poisons; the on-site investigations of various investigation teams and fair-minded people from various countries; the scientific inspection process of many poisonous insects and poisonous substances spread by American imperialism, as well as the testimonies of four American Air Force prisoners who personally threw bacterial bombs... These are all true records of activities at that time and place. Korean and Chinese film workers are engaged in this work with a very objective attitude. All the materials used have the most conclusive evidence. Because this film maintains the absolute authenticity of the event reporting, it can withstand any factual and scientific verification. This is a solemn accusation by Korean and Chinese film workers against the bacteriological warfare crimes of the United States.

    American criminals are very afraid of this kind of truthful reporting. The U.S. government once instructed the Costa Rican government to confiscate another film brought back by peace fighter Eduardo Mora about the U.S. carrying out bacteriological warfare, and imprisoned Mora; at the 18th International Red Cross Conference, the U.S. government also manipulated the conference to prevent our delegation from showing a film about the U.S. carrying out bacteriological warfare at the conference. However, crimes cannot be covered up. The crimes of the U.S. in carrying out bacteriological warfare have been fully confirmed by the evidence announced by China and Korea and the investigations by fair-minded people and scientists from various countries. The facts recorded in this film will more forcefully expose the crimes of the United States to the just people of the world. The towering crimes of the American aggressors can absolutely not be covered up.

    Now, this film has been screened in Beijing and will soon be screened throughout the country and abroad. Dear viewers, dear friends, let us further recognize the ugly and vicious face of American imperialism, let us transform anger into strength, stand at our respective posts, and dedicate more of our strength to strengthening the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and to defend human security and world peace!

    把美国细菌战犯的罪行揭露在世界人民面前
    影片“反对细菌战”主编　史东山
    “反对细菌战”是一部大型纪录片，这是美帝国主义在朝鲜战场和我国东北进行细菌战罪行的真相实录，同时也反映了朝、中人民强大的防御细菌战的力量，和反对细菌战斗争的辉煌胜利。
    美帝国主义者进行细菌战的罪行，使中、朝电影工作者感到震惊和愤怒，为了保卫人类的文明和安全，我们感觉到必须用电影这个有力的工具，把细菌战犯们的罪行揭露在世界人民的面前。
    美国政府对罪恶的细菌战是早有准备的。第二次世界大战的战火熄灭不久，美国政府便通过各种反动书报杂志，到处传播着细菌战的反动思想。他们甚至用“细菌武器在嘲笑原子武器”的漫画，狂妄地宣扬着细菌武器的“威力”；美国的许多反动报章杂志都曾公开报道，在华盛顿附近，以及在巴斯卡高拉城、得格威城等地设有细菌试验场。早在一九四九年三月十二日，美国国防部长福莱斯特尔便公开叫嚣着：一旦情况必要，他们就会使用细菌武器。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场接二连三失败之后，便悍然违犯国际公法并不顾人类的尊严，在朝鲜，继而又在我国东北地区使用了细菌武器，广泛地散布致人死命的病菌。当你目睹平壤市韩老太太悲愤地诉说美国细菌战犯制造的病菌害死了她的丈夫和两个活泼的小孙子和美国细菌战犯一切罪行的时候，怎能遏止自己的愤怒呢？
    散布病菌的美国战犯们已名符其实地成为人类最凶恶的公敌，它们的狠毒心肠已远远超过它的前辈——法西斯头子希特勒了。　它们原想就此可以使朝、中人民畏惧退缩，但，这完全是它们的梦想。美帝国主义的罪恶行为，点燃起了中朝两国人民愤怒的烈火。强大的人民防疫队伍组织起来了，大批消毒器材和药品运往受灾的地区，爱国的科学家、医药卫生工作者，一队一队地走上反细菌战的最前线……人民的坚强意志，有效的防疫措施，控制了美国所撒布的毒虫、毒物，防止了疫病的蔓延。
    世界各国发出对美国政府进行细菌战的声讨，正义的声音从各个角落传来。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、波兰等国的群众为反对美国进行细菌战，举行了示威游行；美国的公正报纸也揭露了美国政府进行细菌战的罪责；英国、法国、印度、澳大利亚等国的公正报纸一致严厉谴责美国政府的残暴行为。美帝国主义的罪恶行为，使它在世界人民面前更加孤立了，这必将加速它的失败。
    我们已把这一切，忠实地摄入影片。这部影片所记录的，还有：许多美帝国主义撒过细菌毒物的现场情况；各个调查团和各国公正人士在现场调查的情况；许多对美帝国主义所撒毒虫毒物的科学检验经过，以及四个曾亲手投掷细菌弹的美国空军俘虏亲口供述的证词……这都是当时当地活动的实录。朝、中电影工作者是以十分客观的态度来从事这项工作的。所用一切材料，都有最确凿的证据。因为这部影片保持了事态报道的绝对真实性，所以它经得起任何事实的和科学的考证。这是朝、中电影工作者对美国细菌战罪行的严正控诉。
    美国罪犯们是十分惧怕这种真实的报道的。美国政府曾指使哥斯达黎加政府没收了和平战士艾杜亚多·莫拉所带回国的关于美国进行细菌战的另一部影片，并曾将莫拉关入监狱；在第十八届国际红十字会大会上，美国政府也曾操纵大会阻止我国代表团在大会上放映关于美国进行细菌战的影片。但是，罪行是掩盖不住的。美国进行细菌战的罪行已为朝、中两国所公布的罪证和各国公正人士及科学家的调查所完全证实，这部影片所记载的事实将使美国的罪行在全世界正义人民的面前更有力地揭露出来。美国侵略者的滔天罪行已绝对无法掩盖了。
    现在，这部影片已在北京放映，不久就要在全国各地并在国外放映。亲爱的观众，亲爱的朋友们，让我们进一步认清美帝国主义丑恶狠毒的面貌，让我们化愤怒为力量，站在各自的岗位上，为加强抗美援朝斗争，为保卫人类安全与世界和平，更多地献出自己的力量吧！
