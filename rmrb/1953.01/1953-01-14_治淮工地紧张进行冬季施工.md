Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, January 13th: The third year of the Huai River project has now entered the intense phase of winter construction. The number of civilian laborers on the dikes of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River has reached 1.05 million. By the end of 1952, approximately 16 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed. Currently, laborers in the upper reaches are excavating the water diversion tunnels for the Nanwan Reservoir and the Boshan Reservoir. In the massive Foziling Reservoir construction project in the middle reaches, laborers are continuing to clear the reservoir dam foundation and pour concrete for the six dam piers of the continuous arch dam in the harsh winter weather. In the diversion projects of the Huai River's main stream and tributaries within the Su County area of Anhui Province, a total of 1.5 million cubic meters of earthwork has been completed in dredging the Chong River, Tong River, cutting the Fengshan Ridge, and excavating the Bogang Diversion Canal. Preparations for the North Fei River's canal improvement project are being intensified, and it is expected to officially commence after the Spring Festival. The large-scale Sanhe Sluice Gate project controlling Hongze Lake in the lower reaches had its gate base slab poured ahead of schedule in mid-December last year, and the pouring of the gate piers and bridge piers has now begun. A drainage canal more than 130 kilometers long, excavated north of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, has completed 85 percent of the entire project.

During the winter construction of the third year of the Huai River project, the quality and efficiency of work have been significantly improved due to the active promotion of advanced Soviet experience and the experience of advanced workers in the Huai River project. The reason why the laborers building the Foziling Reservoir are able to continue pouring concrete in the severe winter is because they have adopted the Soviet winter operation method. In the construction of the Sanhe Sluice Gate base slab, cement workers learned the Soviet "assembly line operation method," reducing the time required to pour each base slab from the initial 29 hours to 16 hours, and completed the entire gate base slab pouring project ahead of schedule; they poured approximately 20,000 cubic meters of concrete in more than 450 hours. In the Bogang Diversion Canal project in northern Anhui, the efficiency of earthwork has been greatly improved due to the promotion of the earthwork method created by Zhu Huai-shun, a model laborer in the Huai River project; some labor teams have increased their average daily earthwork from 0.75 cubic meters per person to 0.95 cubic meters, with the highest reaching 1.3 cubic meters.

In the planning, design, and construction of the third year of the Huai River project, the procedures for national capital construction were strictly followed. At the beginning of construction, the Huai River Commission carefully reviewed the project plans and decided to postpone or cancel 28 projects that were poorly designed, had insufficient manpower, or had little effect. The leading authorities of various construction sites have also successively submitted their "technical designs" for some projects that were originally reported with only "preliminary designs."

    治淮工地紧张进行冬季施工
    【新华社蚌埠十三日电】第三年度治淮工程现已进入冬季施工的紧张阶段。淮河上、中、下游上堤民工已达一百零五万人，到一九五二年底，共完成土方工程约有一千六百多万公方。现在上游民工正在开凿南湾水库和薄山水库的输水隧洞。中游巨型的佛子岭水库建库工程中，民工们正在严寒的气候下，一面继续清理水库坝基，一面浇灌连拱坝中六座坝垛的混凝土；在安徽省宿县专区境内的淮河干流和支流的分流工程中，疏浚漴河、潼河、峰山切岭和开挖泊岗引河等土方工程，共已完成一百五十万公方。北淝河的沟渠整理工程，准备工作已更为加紧，春节后就可正式开工。下游规模庞大的控制洪泽湖的三河闸工程，去年十二月中旬已提前浇好闸基底板，现正开始浇灌闸墩和桥墩。在苏北灌溉总渠以北开挖的一条一百三十多公里长的排水渠，已完成全部工程的百分之八十五。
    第三年度治淮工程冬季施工中，由于积极推广了苏联的先进经验和治淮先进工作者的经验，工作质量和工作效率都有显著提高。修建佛子岭水库的民工所以能在严冬继续作浇灌混凝土的工作，就是因为采用了苏联冬季作业法的缘故。浇筑三河闸闸基底板工程中，水泥工人学习苏联的“流水作业法”，使每浇好一块底板从最初需要二十九个小时缩短到十六个小时，提前完成了全部浇闸基底板工程；他们在四百五十多个小时内，浇筑了约两万立方公尺的混凝土。皖北泊岗引河工程中，由于推广了治淮模范民工祝怀顺创造的土工工作法，土方工程效率已大为提高；有些民工小队从原来每人每天平均做零点七五公方提高到零点九五公方，最高的达到一点三公方。
    第三年度治淮工程在规划、设计和施工方面，严格地执行了国家基本建设的程序。开工之初，治淮委员会慎重地审查了工程计划，对设计不周密、人力不足或作用不大的二十八个工程，已决定缓办或不办。各工地领导机关对原来上报的只有“初步设计”的一些工程，也都陆续补报了它们的“技术设计”。
