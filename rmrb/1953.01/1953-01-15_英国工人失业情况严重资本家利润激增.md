    British Workers' Unemployment Serious, Capitalists' Profits Soar
    The British "Scotsman" reported that the number of unemployed in Scotland is "alarmingly high." The Stornoway fishing area has the highest number of unemployed, accounting for 30 percent of the fishing workers. The number of unemployed textile workers in Glasgow and other areas is also increasing.
    As a result of unemployment, workers' living standards are getting lower and lower, but capitalists' profits are constantly increasing. The "Daily Worker" wrote: "Among the five major banks, two more banks have announced a significant increase in their profits for 1952. The profit of Midland Bank is £2,074,887, compared to £1,925,316 in 1951. The profit of Lloyds Bank is £1,964,665, compared to £1,815,858 in 1951."

    英国工人失业情况严重资本家利润激增
    英国“苏格兰人报”报道说：苏格兰失业人数“多得惊人”，斯托尔瑙威捕渔区的失业人数最多，占渔业工人百分之三十。格拉斯哥及其他地区的纺织工人失业的人数也在增加。
    由于失业的结果，工人的生活水平愈来愈低，但资本家的利润却在不断增加。“工人日报”写道：“在五大银行中，又有两家银行宣布它们一九五二年的利润大大增加。密德兰银行的利润是二百零七万四千八百八十七英镑，它在一九五一年的利润是一百九十二万五千三百十六英镑。罗伊兹银行的利润是一百九十六万四千六百六十五英镑，一九五一年的利润是一百八十一万五千八百五十八英镑。”
