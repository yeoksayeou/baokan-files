Why the Beijing Company of China National Department Store Has 45.2 Billion Yuan of Goods Stockpiled
    Shen Wenyin
    The Beijing Company of China National Department Store (hereinafter referred to as Beijing Department Store Company) currently has a backlog of more than 92,200 dozen of elasticated socks, more than 150,000 dozen of towels, more than 96,600 pieces of matches, more than 32,000 reams of typing paper, and a batch of glazed paper, Hercules shoes, and domestically produced wool serge. These slow-moving and substandard products occupy a total of 45.2 billion yuan in capital, and the interest and storage costs due to long-term stockpiling have reached 9.18 billion yuan.
    Most of the more than 150,000 dozen of towels and more than 92,200 dozen of elasticated socks stockpiled by the Beijing Department Store Company were purchased from, entrusted for processing, or ordered from private knitting businesses in Beijing; a portion of the elasticated socks were entrusted for processing or ordered from the state-owned Qinghe United Factory.
    When the Beijing Department Store Company conducted inventory and sorting work in the third quarter of last year, it did not know the specific figures of the stockpiled goods because the inspection of goods was not thorough. Some cadres believed that it was a seasonal stockpiling phenomenon and could definitely be allocated in winter; some cadres believed that most of the towels and socks produced in Beijing could be sold to the rural areas of Northeast and North China. When state-owned department store enterprises in Northeast, North China, and other regions were unwilling to purchase, the cadres of the Beijing Department Store Company began to feel the seriousness of stockpiling these goods. The company sent five sales teams to major cities in Northeast, Central South, Northwest, and other regions to find sales channels. The two teams going to North China and Northeast focused on selling towels and socks. During the sales process, they found that the patterns of Beijing towels were monotonous and the quality was too poor. The quality of towels produced by general small and medium-sized city handicraft industries has already exceeded that of Beijing products. Therefore, Beijing towels had no market. Beijing's elasticated socks were neither long nor short, and were very unsuitable. Generally, citizens like to wear sock liners in summer and flat socks in winter, and very few wear elasticated socks; farmers simply do not like to wear elasticated socks, because elasticated socks worn on the calves will fall down without garters. When people in Northeast wear riding breeches and cotton trousers in winter, they like to wear elasticated socks, but they want double-thread soles and good colors. Many of the elasticated socks in the Beijing Department Store Company's inventory are woven with yarn batches, the sock openings become larger and larger as they are worn, the soles break after only a few wears, and the colors are dull and dim. People in Northeast are unwilling to buy this kind of low-quality elasticated socks.
    The facts fully demonstrate that the batch of towels and elasticated socks produced in Beijing that the Beijing Department Store Company blindly purchased and blindly entrusted for processing and ordering were stockpiled because they did not meet the needs of the masses.
    The Beijing Department Store Company's practice of blindly purchasing and blindly entrusting processing and ordering is also reflected in the company's purchase of typing paper and guaranteed sales of matches. The company thought that there were many government offices in Beijing, and typing paper would definitely sell well. Therefore, in July 1951, the company bought a large batch of typing paper. In the spring of 1952, the company bought another batch of typing paper, and in the summer, it exchanged for another batch of typing paper at the materials exchange conference, so it purchased a total of more than 43,000 reams of typing paper. Recently, the company checked the sales situation and found out that only a quarter of the typing paper had been sold in the past year and a half, and the existing typing paper could still be sold for more than four years. For example, the company did not understand the production and sales situation of matches. In May and July 1952, it signed match guaranteed sales contracts with Housheng Match Factory and Danhua Match Factory respectively, but the sales of matches have been sluggish. After the company's sales team went to various places to understand the production and sales situation in November last year, it realized that major sales markets such as Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, and Tongxian have now had match factories, and their match packaging is simple, the price is low, and the sales are very good. The matches produced in Beijing are expensive and have a small market. The Beijing Department Store Company's inventory of matches occupies 11.1 billion yuan in capital, and the interest and storage costs paid since the matches were stockpiled have reached more than 880 million yuan. The company does not have a dangerous goods warehouse and has to send people to the Tianjin dangerous goods warehouse to store these matches.
    The view of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee and the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce of supporting the production of industries and handicrafts whose products do not meet the needs of the people is an important factor causing the large-scale stockpiling of goods by the Beijing Department Store Company. For example, in November last year, in order to "take care" of the Qinghe United Factory's financial difficulties, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee instructed the Beijing Department Store Company to purchase 5,000 dozen of its low-quality single-batch yarn elasticated socks. At that time, the Beijing Department Store Company refused to purchase, and the person in charge of the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee said that the cadres of the Municipal Department Store Company had a weak production viewpoint, a low level of policy understanding, and were not enthusiastic about supporting production, and had serious capitalist business thinking. Under such circumstances, the leaders of the Beijing Department Store Company did not dare to refuse to purchase. They thought: It is impossible not to purchase. Let’s buy it. Anyway, the public is stockpiling, anyway, "the meat rots in the pot!" Last summer, the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, on the grounds of "avoiding workers' unemployment," asked the Municipal Department Store Company to purchase substandard products from more than 100 private knitting factories. In this way, a large number of low-quality, unsaleable towels and socks were put into warehouses, causing long-term stockpiling of large amounts of capital, and a batch of interest and storage costs had to be paid. Recently, the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce again instructed the Beijing Department Store Company to continue to sign a guaranteed sales contract for 80,000 pieces of matches with the Danhua Match Factory. The Beijing Department Store Company has expressed its disagreement, but the problem has not been resolved. The Qinghe United Factory's elasticated socks have been stockpiled in the Beijing Department Store Company's warehouse in large quantities, and the Municipal Department Store Company is unwilling to entrust processing and ordering again, but the Qinghe United Factory has been requesting entrusted processing. The Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has adopted a compromise approach, requiring the Municipal Department Store Company to continue to entrust processing of a part; for the problem that the Qinghe United Factory continues to produce low-quality elasticated socks, it does not take effective measures to solve it. The processing and ordering problem
    "Negotiations" have been going on for many days, but it has not been resolved.
    The China National Department Store Beijing Company has not timely and deeply understood the production and sales situation, and blindly purchased goods without considering the people's needs for goods, causing a large number of goods to be stockpiled and causing huge waste of state funds. This supply-based thinking and conservative thinking in management must be seriously examined and vigorously corrected. On the other hand, the leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee and the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce are afraid that these factories whose products do not meet the needs of the people will stop production, and are afraid that the workers in these factories will lose their jobs, so they instruct state-owned department store companies to purchase and entrust processing and ordering, treating state-owned department store companies as relief agencies to solve workers' unemployment, which is also wrong. They did not consider the losses suffered by the state's capital being stockpiled in large quantities, and blindly supported the backward industries and handicrafts whose products do not meet the needs of the people, which is essentially a manifestation of irresponsibility to state property. The leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee and the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce should review and correct this mistake, and should use appropriate methods to solve the production problems of these industries and handicrafts whose products do not meet the needs of the people.

    中国百货公司北京市公司为什么积压了四百五十二亿元的商品
    沈文英
    中国百货公司北京市公司（以下简称北京市百货公司）现在积压了罗口袜子九万二千二百多打，毛巾十五万多打，火柴九万六千六百多件，打字纸三万二千多领，另外还积压了一批有光纸、黑力士鞋和国产毛哔叽。这些滞销品和次品总计共占用资金四百五十二亿元，因长期积压而付出的利息和保管费用已达九十一亿八千多万元。
    北京市百货公司积压的十五万多打毛巾和九万二千多打罗口袜子，大部分是向北京市的私营针织业收购和委托加工、订货的；一部分罗口袜子是向地方国营的清河联合工厂委托加工、订货的。
    北京市百货公司在去年第三季度进行清仓排队工作时，因对商品的清查不彻底，还不知道积压商品的具体数字。有的干部认为那是季节性的积压现象，冬季一定能调拨出去；有的干部认为北京出产的毛巾、袜子大部分可以推销到东北和华北农村。等到东北、华北等区的国营百货企业不愿进货时，北京市百货公司的干部才开始感到积压这些商品的严重性。该公司曾派了五个推销组，分赴东北、中南、西北等区的主要城市去找销路。去华北、东北的两组重点推销毛巾、袜子。他们在推销过程中发现：北京毛巾的花式单调，质量太差，现在一般中小城市手工业生产的毛巾，质量已超过北京产品。因此，北京的毛巾就没有销路。北京的罗口袜子既不长，又不短，很不适用。一般市民夏天喜欢穿袜套，冬天喜欢穿平口袜，穿罗口袜子的很少；农民根本不喜欢穿罗口袜，因为罗口袜子穿到腿肚子上，不用吊袜带就会往下掉。东北人民冬天穿马裤、绒裤时，喜欢穿罗口袜子，但要双线底和颜色好的。北京市百货公司库存的罗口袜子，其中有很多是纱批子织的，袜口越穿越大，底子穿不了几次就破了，而且颜色暗淡无光，东北人民不愿买这种质量低劣的罗口袜子。
    事实充分地说明了：北京市百货公司盲目收购和盲目委托加工、订货的这一批北京出产的毛巾和罗口袜子，是由于不适合群众的需要而积压下来的。
    北京市百货公司这种盲目收购和盲目委托加工、订货的作法，还表现在该公司收购打字纸和包销火柴的问题上。该公司以为北京机关多，打字纸一定好销。因此，一九五一年七月，该公司买进了大批打字纸。一九五二年春季，该公司又买进一批打字纸，夏季又在物资交流大会上换进一批打字纸，这样就一共收购了四万三千多领打字纸。最近该公司检查销售情况，才知道一年半以来，打字纸只销售了四分之一，现存的打字纸还可销售四年多。再如该公司不了解火柴的产销情况，在一九五二年五月和七月分别与厚生火柴厂、丹华火柴厂签订了火柴包销合同，但火柴销路一直不畅。去年十一月份该公司推销组到各地了解产销情况后，才发觉主要销售市场如张家口、太原、通县等地，现已有了火柴厂，而且他们的火柴包装简单，价格低，销路很好。北京出产的火柴价格贵，销路很小。北京市百货公司库存火柴占用资金达一百一十一亿元，火柴积压以来所付利息和保管费用达八亿八千多万元。该公司没有危险品仓库，还要专门派人到天津危险品仓库保管这些火柴。
    北京市人民政府财政经济委员会和市工商局存在着扶持产品不适合人民需要的工业和手工业生产的观点，是造成北京市百货公司商品大量积压的重要因素之一。例如去年十一月份，北京市人民政府财政经济委员会为了“照顾”清河联合工厂开支困难的情况，就指示北京市百货公司收购其质量低劣的单批纱罗口袜子五千打。当时北京市百货公司不肯收购，市财政经济委员会的负责人就说市百货公司干部生产观点不强，政策水平低，对扶持生产情绪不高，资本主义经营思想严重。北京市百货公司的领导人在这种情况下，就不敢再拒绝收购了。他心想：不收购是不行的，收下来吧，反正是公家积压，反正是“肉烂在锅里”！去年夏天，北京市工商局以“免得工人失业”为理由，要市百货公司收购一百多家私营针织厂的次品。就这样，大量品质低劣的没有销路的毛巾、袜子被放进了仓库，造成大批资金的长期积压，还要付出一批利息和保管费用。最近，北京市工商局又指示北京市百货公司继续和丹华火柴厂签订八万件火柴的包销合同，北京市百货公司已表示不同意，但问题还未得到解决。清河联合工厂的罗口袜子，北京市百货公司仓库里已积压很多，市百货公司不愿再委托加工、订货，但清河联合工厂一直要求委托加工。北京市工商局则采取折衷办法，要市百货公司再继续委托加工一部分；对于清河联合工厂继续生产品质低劣的罗口袜子这一问题，则不采取有效措施加以解决。加工订货问题
    “谈判”了好多天，也一直没有得到解决。
    中国百货公司北京市公司没有及时深入地了解产销情况，不考虑人民对商品的需要而盲目进货，造成大批商品积压，使国家资金遭受巨大浪费，这种经营上的供给制思想和保守思想是必须认真检查和努力纠正的。另一方面，北京市人民政府财政经济委员会、北京市工商局的领导干部怕这些产品不适合人民需要的工厂停工，怕这些厂的工人失业，就指示国营百货公司收购和委托加工、订货，把国营百货公司当成解决工人失业的救济机关，也是错误的。他们没有考虑到国家资金大批遭受积压所受到的损失，盲目去扶持那种落后的、产品不适合于人民需要的工业和手工业，这实质上是对国家财产不负责任的表现。北京市人民政府财政经济委员会和市工商局的领导干部应该检讨和纠正这种错误，并且应该用适当的办法去解决这些产品不适合人民需要的工业和手工业的生产问题。
