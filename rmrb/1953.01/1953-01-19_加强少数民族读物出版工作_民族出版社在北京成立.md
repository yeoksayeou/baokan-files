    Strengthen the Publication of Reading Materials for Ethnic Minorities
    Nationalities Publishing House Established in Beijing
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 15th] The Central People's Government Publishing Administration and the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, in order to strengthen the publication of reading materials for ethnic minorities, established the Nationalities Publishing House in Beijing on January 15th. Sa Kongliao (Mongolian), a member of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, serves as the director of the publishing house. The main task of the publishing house is to translate and publish books, pictorials in the languages of various ethnic minorities in China, and to provide reading materials on ethnic policies and ethnic work for cadres working on ethnic affairs.
    Due to the ethnic oppression policies implemented by successive reactionary rulers, especially the Kuomintang reactionary government, which restricted the development of cultural and educational undertakings of ethnic minorities, the cultures of various ethnic minorities were very underdeveloped. After the liberation of the whole country, the Central People's Government attached importance to the development of the cultures of ethnic minorities, and the Nationalities Affairs Commission and the cultural publishing institutions in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities successively compiled and printed many reading materials in the languages of fraternal ethnic groups. In 1951, a total of 176 kinds of books and textbooks were published in ethnic minority languages, with more than 2.2 million copies; in 1952, this increased to 376 kinds, with more than 4.3 million copies. In the past three years or so, the Nationalities Affairs Commission alone has translated and published more than one million copies of Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur books and periodicals. The Xinjiang People's Publishing House has translated "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" into Uyghur and Kazakh for publication. The establishment of the Nationalities Publishing House will further strengthen publishing work in this regard.

    加强少数民族读物出版工作
    民族出版社在北京成立
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府出版总署和中央人民政府民族事务委员会为了加强少数民族读物的出版工作，已于一月十五日在北京成立民族出版社，由民族事务委员会委员萨空了（蒙族）担任社长。该社的主要任务是：翻译和出版国内各少数民族语文的图书、画刊及供给民族工作干部关于民族政策和民族工作方面的读物。
    由于历代反动统治者特别是国民党反动政府实行民族压迫政策，限制少数民族文化教育事业的发展，使各少数民族文化很不发达。全国解放后，中央人民政府重视发展少数民族文化的工作，民族事务委员会和各少数民族聚居地区的文化出版机关，便陆续编印了许多兄弟民族语文的读物。在一九五一年用少数民族文字出版的图书、课本共一百七十六种，二百二十多万册；一九五二年就增加到三百七十六种，四百三十多万册。单是民族事务委员会三年多来翻译出版的蒙文、藏文、维吾尔文的书刊就有一百余万册。新疆人民出版社已将“毛泽东选集”译成维吾尔文和哈萨克文出版。民族出版社的成立将会更加加强这方面的出版工作。
