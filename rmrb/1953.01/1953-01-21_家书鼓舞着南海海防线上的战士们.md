Letters from Home Inspire Soldiers on the South China Sea Defense Line
Editor: Before the New Year, the soldiers who vigilantly guard the motherland day and night on the South China Sea defense line joyfully circulated and read precious letters from home.

Tens of thousands of letters brought the yearning and hopeful hearts of relatives to the soldiers. Good news of industrial construction and agricultural harvests came from thousands of cities and villages across the country. Wang Zhanshan, the squad leader of the Ninth Squad of the "Golden Soup Bridge Hero Company," a people's hero who has been awarded the Medal for Combat Bravery and has performed three major meritorious services, received a letter from his brother-in-law, Tian Wangang, who works as a steelworker in the Tangshan Steel Plant. The letter said, "Our factory's steel ingot production has increased by 28 and a half times compared to the Kuomintang's rule, and steel bars have increased by 35 and a half times. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, we have found 900 more tricks, creating 1.1 billion yuan of wealth for the country. We can produce with peace of mind in the rear because you are guarding the national defense. To make the national defense of the motherland more consolidated, we must produce more actively and support you with practical actions!" Tian Wangang's letter was passed from squad to squad, from platoon to platoon. A letter from the snow-covered rural area of Heilongjiang Province was sent to Cheng Jilu, the deputy squad leader of the First Company of a certain unit, written by his brother, Cheng Jifu. The letter stated, "In the past few years since liberation, our family has added three children. Everyone in the village has joined mutual aid groups, and we have had good harvests every year. The year 1952 was particularly good. We are currently digging wells to prepare for drought prevention next year (1953) and strive for increased production. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, people are not only well-fed and clothed, but also their cultural level has greatly improved. Currently, winter schools have been established throughout the province, and all the young people in our family have gone to school and become literate." Xin Zhi Guang, the machine gun squad leader of the Second Squad of the Seventh Company of a certain unit, received a letter from his fiancée, Xin Yuxian, from the rich grasslands of the Kalaqin Banner in Rehe. Xin Yuxian, who used to live in a cave dwelling and lead a hard life, was illiterate, but now she can write letters in her own handwriting. After talking about many aspects of her increasingly better life in the letter, she said, "I will wait for you for several years while you are away. I only hope that you will work and study hard in the army and protect our good life." This letter spread throughout the company, and comrades asked Xin Zhiguang if he had replied every time they saw him. Xin Zhiguang's Chinese language proficiency has improved to the level of a higher elementary school graduate in his cultural studies. He said, "I am about to reply to her, telling her that I must be a good soldier in a modernized national defense force, and I hope that she will learn to drive a tractor."

Letters from home have become a force to inspire the soldiers to move forward. The soldiers have made up their minds not to let any enemy destroy the labor and happy life of the people of the motherland. In order to tell their relatives about their determination, tens of thousands of letters have been sent from the South China Sea defense line to relatives in various places. Sun Jingrui Liu Tianye

    家书鼓舞着南海海防线上的战士们
    编辑同志：新年前，在南海海防线上日日夜夜警惕地守卫着祖国的战士们，欢乐地传阅着珍贵的家信。
    千万封家信给战士们带来了亲人的千万颗怀念和希望的心，从祖国千万个城市和乡村，传来了工业建设和农业丰收的佳音。“金汤桥英雄连”九班班长王占山，是得过战斗勇敢奖章和立过三大功的人民功臣。他接到了在唐山钢厂当炼钢工人的姐夫田万钢的信。信上说：“我们工厂钢锭的生产量比国民党统治时期提高了二十八倍半，钢条提高了三十五倍半。在增产节约找窍门运动中，又找了窍门九百多件，为国家创造财富十一亿元。我们能在后方安心生产，都是因为你们守卫着国防。为了使祖国国防更加巩固，我们一定更积极生产，用实际行动支援你们！”田万钢的信从这班传到那班，从这排又传到那排。还从盖满白雪的黑龙江省的农村，寄给某部一连副班长程吉禄的一封信，是他哥哥程吉福写的。信上写着“解放后这几年，咱家已添了三个小孩。全村人都加入了互助组，年年丰收。一九五二年年景特别好。现下正在打井，准备明年（一九五三年）防旱，争取增产。在毛主席领导下，人们不但丰衣足食，而且文化水平也大大提高了。目前全省都办了冬校，咱全家年轻人都已经上学，识字了。”某部七连机枪二班班长信志广的未婚妻辛玉贤，从热河喀喇沁旗那富饶的草原上，寄来了一封信。本来是住窑洞过苦日子的辛玉贤，大字不识一个，现在能亲笔写信了。信上谈了许多生活日益美好的情形后，说：“你在外几年我等你几年。只希望你在部队中好好工作和学习，保卫咱们的好日子。”这封信传遍了全连，同志们一见信志广，就问回信了没有。信志广在文化学习中，语文程度已提高到高小毕业的程度。他说：“我正要回信给她，告诉她我一定要做一个现代化国防军的好战士，希望她去学习驾驶拖拉机。”
    家信成为鼓舞战士们前进的一种力量。战士们纷纷下定决心，坚决不让任何敌人破坏祖国人民的劳动和幸福生活。战士们为了把自己的决心告诉给亲人们，千万封信又纷纷从南海海防线上寄到各地各亲人手中去。　孙景瑞　刘天野
