    Congratulating Painter Qi Baishi on His Ninety-Third Birthday
    Today is the ninety-third birthday of the Chinese painter Mr. Qi Baishi. China's art circles are holding a celebration for him. Mr. Baishi was born into a working people's family. He loved painting from an early age, studied diligently, and finally became an outstanding Chinese painter.
    Mr. Baishi's name is Huang. He was born in 1861 in Xingdoutang, Xiangtan, Hunan Province, to a peasant family. Due to the poverty of his family, when he was eight years old, his mother used the money from selling the remaining grains from threshing rice to pay for him to study for half a year. After that, he herded cattle and gathered firewood at home. At the age of eleven, his father taught him to farm, but because his physical strength could not support it, he switched to carpentry, working as a carpenter for fifteen years.
    When he worked as a carpenter, he often traveled with his master to work at employers' homes in distant villages. In the tool basket he carried, in addition to knives and axes, he also placed small cans of tung oil, paper, and brushes. After a day's work, he would light an oil lamp in the evening and practice painting until late at night, without resting. He painted everything in nature: landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects, and fish.
    After the age of twenty, he became a skilled flower carving expert in fine carpentry, and the figures, flowers, and birds he carved were ingenious and vividly portrayed. His reputation as a painter gradually became known, and as a result, he was able to study portraiture from two folk painters, Xiao Xianghai and Wen Shaoke, and also worked as a painting craftsman. He learned the sketching methods of "conveying spirit" and "capturing likeness." At the same time, he began to associate with some local literati, writing classical poetry and coming into contact with the freehand works of Ming Dynasty loyalists, which gave him great inspiration and influence in his creation.
    After the age of forty, he traveled extensively to the north and south five times. In seven or eight years, he traveled almost all over China, visiting Mount Hua, Mount Song, Mount Lu, Mount Shu, the Wuxia Gorges, Yangshuo, Guilin, the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, Dongting Lake, and the Yellow River. These magnificent rivers and mountains of the motherland gave him infinite nourishment, not only enriching his descriptive realm but also broadening his mind and spirit. After returning, he spent several years at the "Jieshan Hall" at the foot of Mount Heng, sorting out what he had gained from his travels and creating "Jieshan Tu," a total of fifty paintings, which are important works of his landscape paintings. At the same time, he planted flowers, fruits, and trees, and raised insects and birds, observing them morning and evening, repeatedly depicting them, and mastering the typical characteristics of these flowers, fruits, and small animals, so he could vividly reproduce the transparent shrimp swimming in the water on paper. From then on, he left the clichés of his predecessors and embarked on a path of originality. This year, the old man Baishi has reached the age of ninety-three, but he is still hale and hearty, and continues to carve seals and paint as usual.
    Qi Baishi's works come from his profound observation of natural scenery and have the characteristics of being both lifelike in form and spirit. From his works, we can clearly see the diligent and tireless labor enthusiasm of a true artist, his delicate and careful ability to observe the scenes of life, and the ingenuity of his skill in expressing the scenes with refined creativity. It should be particularly pointed out that Mr. Qi Baishi's works have absorbed the excellent elements of Chinese folk art and creatively developed the expressive techniques of our national traditional ink painting, giving his works a clear, healthy, fresh, pleasant, and vibrant national style and spirit. This is the artistic value of Qi Baishi's works. (Attached pictures)

### 祝贺画家齐白石九十三岁寿辰

    祝贺画家齐白石九十三岁寿辰
    今天是国画家齐白石先生九十三岁寿辰。我国艺术界特为他举行庆祝会。白石先生出生于劳动人民的家庭，自幼爱好绘画，专心学习，终于成为我国杰出的国画家。
    白石先生名璜，一八六一年出生在湖南湘潭星斗塘地方一个农民家里。由于家庭的穷苦，八岁时，他的母亲把椎稻草上剩余的谷粒，换得钱，积存下来，供给他读了半年书，以后就在家里放牛打柴。十一岁时，他的父亲教他耕田，因体力不能支持，改学木工，做了十五年的木匠。
    他做木匠时，常随师傅远走外村，到雇主家里做工，在提着的工具篮子里，除了刀斧之外，还放着小小的桐油罐子及纸笔。一天工作完毕，便在晚间燃点油灯练习作画，直至深夜不知休息。凡是自然界的景物、山水、人物、花鸟、虫鱼无所不画。
    二十岁后，他成为精细木工的雕花名手，所雕的人物花鸟，能匠心独运，刻画入神。他的画名也渐为人知，因之得从两位民间画师萧芗陔、文少可学习画像，兼做了画工。他学会了“传神”“写照”的写生方法；同时他开始结识了一些当地文人，写作古典诗词，并接触了明遗民的写意作品，这给他在创作上很大的启发和影响。
    四十岁后，他曾五次远游南北各地，在七八年间，几乎走遍了半个中国；游历过华山、嵩山、庐山、蜀山、巫峡、阳朔、桂林、长江、珠江、洞庭、黄河。这些祖国雄伟的河山，都给他以无限的滋养；不仅丰富了他的描写境界，也壮阔了他的胸襟气派。回来后在南岳山下的“借山馆”，整理数年游历所得，作“借山图”，共五十图，是他山水画的重要作品。同时手植花卉果木，养虫养鸟，朝夕观摩，反复描绘，掌握了这些花果和小动物的典型性，所以能把浮游在水里透明的虾子，栩栩如生地再现在纸上。从此以后，他离开了前人的窠臼，走向独创的道路。今年白石老人已届九十三岁的高龄，但仍精神矍铄，照常刻印作画。
    齐白石的作品是从对自然景物精深的观察中来，具有形神兼备真实生动的特色。从他的作品中，我们能够清楚地看到一个真正艺术家的勤朴不倦的劳动热情，和对生活景物的细腻精心的观察能力，以及表现景物的那种富有精练创造才能的匠心。特别应当指出的，齐白石先生的作品是接受了我国民间艺术的优良成分，并创造性地发挥了我们民族传统水墨画的表现技法，使他的作品具有明朗、健康、清新、愉快、生气勃勃的民族风格和气魄。这就是齐白石先生作品中所具有的艺术价值。（附图片）
