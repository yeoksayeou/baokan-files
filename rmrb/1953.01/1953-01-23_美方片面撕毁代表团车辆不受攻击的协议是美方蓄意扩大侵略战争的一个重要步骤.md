    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 22nd: This correspondent reports: After Washington interrupted the armistice negotiations on October 8th of last year and closed the door to resuming negotiations at the United Nations General Assembly, the US side has now unilaterally torn up the agreement regarding the non-attack of representative delegation vehicles. This action marks a new stage in the US's conspiracy to undermine the remaining foundations of the armistice negotiations. Our chief liaison officer, Zhu Ran, emphasized this point in a letter delivered to the US liaison officer on the 21st. The letter pointed out that these recent provocative actions are "a planned action on your part to practically undermine the various administrative agreements related to the armistice negotiations, and then to openly tear up these agreements, in order to ultimately completely destroy the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations."
    When Harrison interrupted the armistice negotiations, the Truman government wanted the world to believe that this action was "a definite step towards achieving an armistice agreement." Now everyone can see that this was a step in deliberately expanding the war. Negotiations have been stalled for three months and fourteen days, and now there are various signs showing that the Eisenhower government wants to sweep away the remaining parts of the agreement related to the armistice negotiations.
    As can be seen from the recent situation of the liaison officer meetings held in Panmunjom, the means adopted by the US side are: 1. Openly tear up the agreement; 2. Refuse to acknowledge responsibility for tearing up the agreement.
    These new provocative actions by the US side followed a significant increase in incidents of undermining the agreement after the negotiations were interrupted. Since the interruption of the negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side has lodged protests with the US chief liaison officer regarding nineteen incidents of violating the agreement. These incidents include shelling the conference area, US aircraft intruding over the conference area, dropping hostile leaflets, and bombing and strafing representative delegation vehicles. The number of incidents of violating the conference area agreement alone increased to seven last month, setting a new record. The recent US action of tearing up the agreement is to admit that American aircraft intruded into the airspace over the conference area, but to refuse to acknowledge the responsibility for undermining the agreement and the understanding between liaison officers.
    A US military headquarters spokesman in Tokyo threatened that "intrusion into the airspace over the conference area is inevitable." What he means is that the hostile flights of the US Air Force threatening the Panmunjom conference area and the Kaesong neutral zone will continue regardless of the agreement. American jets leave several white streaks in the sky over Kaesong every day, and low-flying aircraft circle over Kaesong for reconnaissance.
    It is clear that after interrupting the negotiations, the US's sabotage tactics have reached the point where it is not enough to undermine the agreement, but it must tear up the agreement to completely break the negotiations. Since the start of the negotiations, American aircraft have strafed and bombed representative delegation vehicles nine times. Last year, sixteen members of the representative delegation vehicle team were injured by American aircraft, and one person was killed. The US's unilateral tearing up of the agreement on non-attack of representative delegation vehicles means that the US Air Force will openly bomb and strafe representative delegation supply vehicles and murder representative delegation personnel in the future, in order to more tightly close the door to resuming negotiations.
    Well-informed sources here pointed out that, as in the past, all the provocative actions of the United States will not affect the Kaesong Korean-Chinese delegation's firm struggle for a reasonable and fair Korean armistice. The only result of these provocative actions will be to further expose the US government to the world as the evil saboteur of armistice negotiations. These actions can only make the Korean and Chinese people more determined to fight to the end for the repatriation of all prisoners of war and the final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 美方片面撕毁代表团车辆不受攻击的协议是美方蓄意扩大侵略战争的一个重要步骤

    美方片面撕毁代表团车辆不受攻击的协议是美方蓄意扩大侵略战争的一个重要步骤
    【新华社开城二十二日电】本社特派记者报道：在华盛顿于去年十月八日中断停战谈判并在联合国大会上关闭了恢复谈判的大门之后，美方又片面地撕毁关于不得攻击代表团车队的协议，这种行动标志着美方破坏停战谈判的残存基础的阴谋的新阶段。我方首席联络官朱然在二十一日交给美方联络官的一封信中强调了这一点。信上指出，最近的这种挑衅行动是“你方从实际上破坏有关停战谈判的各项行政协议，进而公开撕毁这些协议，以便最后完全破坏朝鲜停战谈判基础的一个有计划的行动。”
    当哈利逊使停战谈判中断时，杜鲁门政府想要全世界相信这种行动是“取得停战协议的一个肯定的步骤”。现在大家都能看见，这是蓄意扩大战争的一个步骤。谈判已停顿了三个月又十四天，现在还有种种迹象显示艾森豪威尔政府要把有关停战谈判的协议的残存部分一扫而光。
    从最近在板门店举行的联络官会议的情形可以看出，美方采取的手段是：一、公然撕毁协议，二、拒绝承认撕毁协议的责任。
    美方这些新的挑衅行动，是在谈判中断后破坏协议的事件显著增加后接着采取的。自从谈判中断以后，朝中方面已就十九件破坏协议的事件向美方首席联络官提出抗议，这些事件包括炮击会场区、美机侵越会场区上空、投掷有敌意的传单和轰炸扫射代表团车队。仅仅破坏会场区协议的事件，在上月就增加到七件而创了新纪录。最近美国撕毁协议的行动，就是承认美国飞机侵越会场区上空，但拒绝承认这种行动对破坏协议和联络官之间的谅解所应负的责任。
    在东京的一个美军司令部的发言人扬言，“侵越会场区上空是不可避免的。”他的意思是说美国空军威胁板门店会场区和开城中立区的敌意飞行还要不顾协议而继续下去。美国喷气机天天在开城上空留下几条白雾，低飞的飞机在开城上空盘旋侦察。
    很清楚，美方在使谈判中断后，它的破坏策略已到了破坏协议还不够，非要撕毁协议使谈判完全破裂不可的地步。自从谈判开始以来，美国飞机已扫射并轰炸了代表团车队九次。在去年，有十六名代表团车队的人员被美国飞机击伤，另有一人牺牲。美方片面撕毁关于代表团车队不受攻击的协议，意味着美国空军在将来还要公开地轰炸、扫射代表团供应车辆和谋杀代表团人员，以便更紧地关闭恢复谈判的大门。
    此间的消息灵通人士指出，正如过去一样，美国的一切挑衅行动丝毫不致影响开城朝中代表团坚决争取合理而公正的朝鲜停战的斗争。这些挑衅行动的唯一结果，将是美国政府进一步在世界面前暴露出它是停战谈判的罪恶的破坏者。这些行动只能使朝中人民更坚决地为遣返全部战俘和最后和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争到底。
