Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 24th: The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 20th that Sri Lankan officials recently said that the United States' threat to prevent Sri Lanka's rice-rubber trade with China "is tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of an independent and sovereign country." The Sri Lankan officials were referring to the statement made by Harriman, then head of the U.S. Mutual Security Agency under the Truman administration. In his final report to the U.S. Congress on the U.S. trade "blockade" against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, Harriman stated that the five-year trade agreement between China and Sri Lanka on the sale of rubber and rice has caused the United States "serious concern" and that action should be taken to prevent the implementation of this agreement and to impose stricter controls on shipping to China.
The "Daily Worker" of the same day published an editorial entitled "Extortion," condemning "Harriman's arrogant statement that no country can act without the permission of the United States." The editorial said that Britain should now give the United States the same answer as Harriman received from Sri Lankan officials - he has no right to interfere in Sri Lanka's internal affairs. The editorial also condemned the British Conservative Party for continuing to comply with the bans and restrictions imposed by the United States on trade between Britain and the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and China.

    锡兰官员指责
    美国企图阻挠中锡贸易
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】伦敦“工人日报”二十日报道：锡兰官员最近说，美国扬言要阻止锡兰与中国的大米—橡胶贸易，这是“等于干涉一个独立自主国家的内政”。锡兰官员所指的是杜鲁门任内的美国共同安全署署长哈里曼的声明。哈里曼在他向美国国会提出的关于美国对苏联和人民民主国家实行贸易“封锁”的最后报告中所说，中锡关于买卖橡胶和大米的五年贸易协定引起了美国的
    “严重关切”，应当采取行动来阻止这种协定的实施，对通往中国的航运施行更严密的管制。
    同日的“工人日报”发表了题为“讹诈”的社论，谴责“哈里曼所谓任何国家未得美国的允许不能擅自有所作为的这种傲慢无礼的说法”。社论说，英国现在应当给美国一个同样的答复，像哈里曼从锡兰官员方面获得的答复那样——他没有权利干涉锡兰的内政。社论并谴责英国保守党继续遵守美国对英国和东欧人民民主国家及中国之间的贸易所实施的禁令和限制。
