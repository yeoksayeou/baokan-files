Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 5th: In the last six days of 1952, short but quite intense battles occurred on the Korean front every day, three to five times a day. In numerous attacks, ambushes, and engagements, our army's infantry and artillery eliminated more than 1,600 enemies.

　　On the evening of the 26th, a night raid team of our army on the western front operated between enemy and our positions in Songhyeon and Jusazhao north of Cheorwon. When advancing near Songhyeon, they discovered a company of enemies lying in ambush not far ahead. Taking the enemy by surprise, our army immediately opened fire and divided into three groups to attack the enemy from the front and rear. In less than twenty minutes, forty-eight enemies were killed or wounded, and the enemies fled in panic. At a little past one o'clock on the 28th, a night raid team of our army on the eastern front attacked an unnamed highland northwest of Highland 883.7, annihilating an entire search platoon of the puppet 3rd Division's 22nd Regiment. Late at night on the 31st, a night raid team of twelve soldiers of our army, under the cover of artillery fire, launched an attack on a fortified platoon position of the puppet 12th Division south of Changseong-ri, northeast of Mundeung-ri. The battle lasted about an hour, completely annihilating the defending enemy, killing or wounding a total of seventy-eight enemies, while our army only sacrificed one soldier.

　　In these six days, our army's snipers killed and wounded a total of 562 enemies according to incomplete statistics, and our army's mobile artillery fire killed and wounded 894 enemies.

　　In the six days from December 26th to 31st, our army's frontline anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down a total of 15 enemy aircraft and damaged 22 enemy aircraft.

    一九五二年末六天中
    朝中部队歼敌千六百多名毁伤敌机卅七架
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】在一九五二年的最后六天中，朝鲜前线每天都发生三、五次短促的但相当激烈的战斗。在许多次的袭击、伏击和遭遇战中，我军步兵和炮兵共歼灭了一千六百多名敌人。
    二十六日晚上，西线我军一支夜袭队到铁原以北松岘、朱士沼一带敌我阵地之间活动，前进到松岘附近时，发现前面不远处有一连埋伏的敌人，于是我军乘敌人不备，即先向敌人开火，并分成三路前后夹击敌人。打了不到二十分钟，打死打伤敌人四十八名，敌人仓皇逃跑。二十八日一点多钟，东线我军一支夜袭队袭击八八三点七高地西北的无名高地，将伪三师二十二团的一个搜索排全部歼灭。三十一日深夜，东线我军一支十二人的夜袭队在炮火掩护下向文登里东北长承里以南的伪十二师一个加强排阵地袭击，战斗约一小时即将守敌全歼，计毙伤敌七十八名，而我军只牺牲一人。
    我军狙击手们在这六天中据不完全统计共打死和打伤敌人五百六十二名，我军游动炮火击毙击伤敌人八百九十四名。
    从十二月二十六日至三十一日的六天中，我军前线高射炮火共击落敌机十五架、击伤敌机二十二架。
