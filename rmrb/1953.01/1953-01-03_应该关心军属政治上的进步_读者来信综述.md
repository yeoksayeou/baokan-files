    We Should Care About the Political Progress of Military Dependents
    ——Reader Letters Summary

    Our newspaper frequently receives letters from revolutionary soldiers, requesting local governments to care about military dependents politically and help them improve their political consciousness. They believe that when the revolution needed them, revolutionary soldiers' families resolutely handed over their loved ones to the revolution and the motherland, which shows that their political awareness was high at the time. However, with the continuous advancement of the revolutionary situation, their relatives in the revolutionary ranks are receiving the Party's cultivation and revolutionary training, and their political consciousness is rapidly improving. In contrast, their families, due to the lack of regular political education, have a significant gap politically. Guo Mingxiao from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "Thank you, dear government! Every time letters from home mention the government's care for military dependents, it gives great comfort to us soldiers defending the border of the motherland. We must work and study more attentively. In addition, I have a suggestion that the government does not do enough to educate our families politically, helping them to study and improve their political awareness. Sometimes, the words in the letters from home are very inappropriate for us revolutionary soldiers. We can only secretly tear up those backward words when we see them. You should know that what we soldiers care about regarding our families is not as important as caring about their political and ideological progress." Li Yan from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "Military dependents should write letters to soldiers with a responsible attitude towards the country and the people, and should not completely start from personal plans and selfish ideas. Village cadres should help and educate military dependents." Deng Chongming from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "Letters from backward family members sometimes cause ideological confusion among individual comrades in the army and hinder work." Readers unanimously requested that the People's Government should strengthen education for military dependents to improve their political awareness.

    On this issue, readers also reflected on the situation of the "Beijing Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, and Disabled Soldiers Political Study Class" held by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau, which used the method of rotating and transferring martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled soldiers to study politics in a short period of time, which achieved very good results. In 1951, the class was held for a total of five sessions. In 1952, starting from August 30, one session was held every half month, and by November 24, five sessions had been held. The number of participants in each session was about 300. The learning content included political common sense, domestic and international current affairs, and preferential treatment policies. The students were enthusiastic about learning and all made learning covenants. After learning, many military dependents recognized the future of the revolution, the relationship between individuals and collectives, and overcame the past idea of ​​simply relying on government relief. According to the bureau's investigation, the students generally have high work enthusiasm after graduation and can help the district people's government with many tasks. Pan Shuqin, a military dependent in Chongwen District, Beijing, used to think that "eating your own food and working for others is a waste." After studying, she realized her wrong thoughts and rushed to do street work. Many military dependents wrote letters to encourage their children on the front lines in Korea to bravely kill the enemy and strive for merit.

    We believe that Beijing's method of transferring martyrs' and soldiers' families for short-term political education is one of the good ways to improve the political awareness of martyrs' and soldiers' families. Other effective methods include organizing martyrs' and soldiers' families to participate in various social activities, and organizing the masses to visit martyrs' and soldiers' families during the New Year and festivals so that they can recognize their glorious status. It is recommended that the preferential treatment departments in various places should give the same importance to caring about the political and ideological progress of military dependents as to caring about the lives and production of military dependents. According to the specific conditions and circumstances of each place, choose appropriate and effective methods to strengthen the political education of military dependents.

### 应该关心军属政治上的进步——读者来信综述

    应该关心军属政治上的进步
    ——读者来信综述
    本报经常接到革命军人来信，他们要求各地政府从政治上关心军属，帮助军属提高政治觉悟。他们认为：革命军人家属在革命需要的时候，毅然把自己的亲人交给革命，交给祖国，这说明他们在当时的政治觉悟是高的。但是，在革命形势不断向前发展的情况下，他们的亲人在革命队伍中，受着党的培养和革命的锻炼，政治觉悟很快地提高着，而他们的家属，因为缺少经常的政治教育，相形之下，在政治上就有了很显著的距离。解放军某部郭明孝来信说：“感谢亲爱的政府！每次家里来信时，都提到政府对军属的关心，这给我们保卫祖国边疆的战士很大的安慰，我们一定要更专心地工作和学习。另外我还有点意见，就是政府对我们家属在政治上进行教育，帮助他们学习，提高他们的政治觉悟，还做得不够。有时家里来信所说的话，对我们革命军人说来，很不相称。我们看到那些落后话，只有偷偷地把它撕掉。要知道，我们军人关心家庭的生活，是没有关心他们的政治、思想的进步来得更要紧。”志愿军某部李焰来信说：“军属给军人写信，应抱着对国家人民负责的态度，不应完全从个人打算和自私自利的想法出发。村干部应该对军属进行帮助和教育。”志愿军某部邓崇明来信说：“落后家属来的信，有时会引起部队中个别同志思想的混乱，妨碍工作。”读者一致要求人民政府应对军属加强教育，以提高他们的政治觉悟。
    在这个问题上，读者也反映了北京市人民政府民政局举办的“北京市革命烈属军属残废军人政治学习班”，用轮流抽调烈属、军属、残废军人短期集中学习政治的办法，收到了很好效果的情况。一九五一年该班共开办五期。一九五二年自八月三十日开始，每半月一期，到十一月二十四日止，已开办了五期。参加学习的人数每期约三百余人。学习内容是政治常识、国内外时事、优抚政策等。学员的学习情绪饱满，都订了学习公约。学习后，许多军属认清了革命的前途，个人和集体的关系，克服了过去单纯依赖政府救济的思想。据该局调查证明，学员结业回去后，一般工作热情都很高，能帮助区人民政府作许多工作。北京崇文区军属潘淑琴，过去认为“吃自己的饭，给别人干活，是冤枉事。”经过学习后，他认识了自己的错误思想，抢着干街道工作。许多军属都写信鼓励在朝鲜前线的子女英勇杀敌，争取立功。
    我们认为，北京市抽调烈军属集中进行短期的政治教育，是提高烈军属政治觉悟的好办法之一。其他如组织烈军属参加各项社会活动，过年过节时组织群众访问烈军属，使他们认识到自己的光荣地位等，也都是有效的办法。建议各地优抚工作部门，应该把关心军属在政治思想上的进步，提到和关心军属的生活、生产同等重要的地位。根据各地的具体条件和情况，选择适当而有效的方法，来加强军属的政治教育。
