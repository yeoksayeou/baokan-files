At the conference, we summarized the rich experience of the Patriotic Health Campaign over the past year and decided on the guidelines and tasks for continuing to carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign in the future. In order to inflict a heavier blow on the enemy, to strengthen our support for your victory on the front lines, and to further improve the health level of the people of the motherland, we will strive with greater strength to realize the decisions of this conference.
