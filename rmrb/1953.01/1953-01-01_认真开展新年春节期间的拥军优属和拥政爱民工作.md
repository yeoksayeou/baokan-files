    Conscientiously Carry Out the Work of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families and Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People During the New Year and Spring Festival
    Supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families and supporting the government and cherishing the people has become a fine tradition of our revolutionary army and people. During the period of celebrating the New Year and welcoming the Spring Festival every year, when all the soldiers and civilians are keenly aware that their struggle has brought them a happier life year after year, they naturally carry out this "support and love movement" more enthusiastically year after year. After the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated all of China, the Chinese People's Volunteers shattered the new aggression of the American imperialists against our country, stabilized the war front on the 38th parallel for a long time, and ensured that our people could rapidly carry out various social and political reforms and economic recovery work in the newly liberated land. As we enter 1953 more happily and are about to begin large-scale economic construction, and as American imperialism is plotting to expand the war of aggression, all revolutionary soldiers and civilians feel the preciousness of the fighting friendship between the people's army and the revolutionary people, so the "support and love movement" in 1953 has its special and significant meaning, and it has become an important part of our current continued efforts to strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea. Because through this work, it can improve the patriotic and internationalist political consciousness of our army and people, strengthen the unity between the army and the people, advance the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, and inspire the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to defend the motherland and fight bravely, so as to strengthen and consolidate the national defense, completely crush the American imperialist conspiracy to expand the war of aggression, ensure the safety of the motherland and peace in Asia, and enable the motherland to carry out large-scale economic construction smoothly.
    On December 29th last year, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission issued a joint directive, requiring people's governments at all levels to lead the broad masses of the people to enthusiastically launch the work of supporting the people's army and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers during the New Year to Spring Festival period in 1953. At the same time, it is also necessary to widely carry out the work of supporting the people's government and cherishing the people among all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This is very important. To carry out this work well, we should continue to carry out propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the military and civilians, publicize the current situation and tasks, the brilliant victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea, the great achievements of various constructions in the motherland, the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, their participation in production and construction, and their love for the people, as well as the active support of the people for resisting America and aiding Korea and the enthusiastic support for the army and preferential treatment to families. This should be given attention by all localities, because only through these propaganda and education will the military and civilians better recognize the development of the situation and understand their responsibilities, and will the military and civilians truly realize each other's respect and love, so as to strengthen the concept of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families and supporting the government and cherishing the people. Otherwise, it is easy to treat it as a routine matter, making these works formalistic. When carrying out these propagandas, localities can adopt the method of mutually inviting typical figures and the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to make reports. All those who have the conditions to do so should strive to do so, because it will not only strengthen the feelings between the military and civilians, but also these typical figures will make reports based on their personal experiences and what they have seen and heard, which will surely be vivid and specific, so that the other party can receive a deeper education. In particular, the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea once again personally saw many moving facts of the Chinese People's Volunteers. These facts have brought infinite enthusiasm and strength to the people of the motherland, and will greatly promote various works. Therefore, we should organize workers, peasants, students, shop assistants, staff of institutions, etc. to listen to their reports, and organize dissemination and discussions to make it known to every household.
    In order to strengthen and improve the "support and love" work, people's governments at all levels should conduct a major inspection of the work of giving preferential treatment, and the troops should conduct an inspection of the implementation of mass discipline. Of course, in terms of the work of giving preferential treatment, since the launch of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, after several large-scale movements to support the army and give preferential treatment to families and inspections of the work of giving preferential treatment, the work of giving preferential treatment has been widely and deeply developed. In particular, significant achievements have been made in improving the work of substituting cultivation, helping families of martyrs and military dependents in production and employment, and settling and organizing disabled revolutionary soldiers to study. However, we have not studied enough of some advanced experiences and methods created in the work. For example, the method of combining substituted cultivation with cooperative mutual aid organizations and the successful experience of selecting models for giving preferential treatment need to be summarized and promoted. There are still many problems that need to be solved vigorously, such as adjusting the burden of substituted cultivation and helping the children of poor martyrs and soldiers to attend school, which must be solved. In some new areas, although the work of substituted cultivation has been established, it has not formed a system, so it cannot be maintained regularly or the substituted cultivation is regarded as a errand. These shortcomings should be overcome quickly. Therefore, all localities must conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work of giving preferential treatment in accordance with the items and spirit specified in the instructions. At the same time, in order to achieve universality and depth, it should be combined with all possible works and forms that can be used, such as military-civilian get-togethers, small-scale investigation seminars, model meetings for giving preferential treatment, group visits, visits, etc., to go deep into the lower levels, listen more to the reflections and opinions of the masses, and conduct serious research and treatment, so as to make an overall plan for the work of giving preferential treatment in 1953 and strive to push the work of giving preferential treatment further forward. In the troops, our army has always been good at implementing mass discipline, and the exemplary deeds of loving and helping the people have been praised by the people of the world. This is the result of Chairman Mao's direct cultivation and education, and it is also the essential manifestation of our people's army. However, because the general troops have been stationed for a long time in the past three years, the phenomenon of borrowing houses and furniture from the masses for a long time has increased, especially the troops stationed in ethnic minority areas, due to different customs, the situation is more complicated. These will more or less affect the normal relationship between the military and civilians. There are also a few people in the troops who have developed a meritorious ideology, cannot correctly treat the government and the masses, and even have illegal and undisciplined behaviors. Therefore, the troops must also conduct an in-depth inspection of the implementation of mass discipline in accordance with the instructions, and make appropriate treatment of the problems found.
    Finally, during the New Year and Spring Festival, military-civilian get-togethers can be held to organize the people to comfort or salute the army, the sick and wounded soldiers, the disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the families of martyrs and military dependents, so as to further strengthen the fighting feelings between the military and civilians and welcome the victorious 1953.

### 认真开展新年春节期间的拥军优属和拥政爱民工作

    认真开展新年春节期间的拥军优属和拥政爱民工作
    拥军优属和拥政爱民，已经成为我国革命军民的优良传统，在每年庆贺新年和迎接春节的时期，全体军民在亲切地感到自己的斗争换得了一年比一年更幸福的生活的时候，就很自然地一年比一年更热烈地来开展这个“拥爱运动”。在中国人民解放军解放了全中国以后，中国人民志愿军又粉碎了美帝国主义对我国的新的侵略，使战争前线长期稳定在三八线，保证了我国人民能够在刚刚获得解放的国土上迅速进行各项社会政治改革工作和经济恢复工作。当我们更幸福地进入一九五三年，即将开始大规模经济建设的时候，当美帝国主义正在阴谋扩大侵略战争的时候，全体革命军民就更加感到人民军队与革命人民的战斗友谊的宝贵，因而一九五三年的“拥爱运动”就有其特殊重大的意义，就成为我们目前继续加强抗美援朝工作的重要部分。因为通过这一工作，可以提高我军民爱国主义和国际主义的政治觉悟，加强军民团结，使拥军优属的工作前进一步，鼓舞中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军捍卫祖国和英勇作战的情绪，从而加强和巩固国防，彻底粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，确保祖国的安全和亚洲和平，使祖国顺利地进行大规模的经济建设。
    去年十二月二十九日，中央人民政府内务部和人民革命军事委员会总政治部已发出联合指示，要各级人民政府领导广大人民群众，在一九五三年新年至春节期间，热烈展开拥护人民军队和优待烈属、军属及革命残废军人的工作，同时，也要在中国人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员中，广泛开展拥护人民政府和爱护人民群众的工作。这是十分重要的。要很好地开展这一工作，就应在军民中继续进行抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，宣传目前的形势和任务，抗美援朝战争的辉煌胜利，祖国各种建设的伟大成就，中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军英勇作战、参加生产建设、爱护人民群众等各种伟大事迹，人民群众积极地支援抗美援朝和热烈拥军优属的情况等。这是应引起各地重视的，因为只有通过这些宣传教育，才会使军民更加认清时局的发展和了解自己的责任，也才会使军民真正认识到彼此的可敬和可爱，以相互加强拥军优属和拥政爱民的观念。否则，很容易把它当成例行公事，使这些工作流为形式。各地在进行这些宣传时，可以采用互相邀请典型人物和中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团做报告的办法。凡有条件这样做的尽量争取这样做，因为它不但会加强军民感情，而且这些典型人物以自己的亲身经历和目睹耳闻作报告，一定讲得生动具体，使对方得到更深入的教育。特别是中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团，他们又一次亲眼看见了中国人民志愿军许多可歌可泣的事实，这些事实给祖国人民带来了无限的热情和力量，对各种工作将起很大的推动作用，所以应该很好地组织工人、农民、学生、店员、机关工作人员等听取他们的报告，并组织传达和讨论，做到家喻户晓。
    为了加强和改进“拥爱”工作，各级人民政府应就优抚工作，部队应就执行群众纪律进行一次大检查。当然，在优抚工作方面，自从抗美援朝运动开展以来，经过几次大规模拥军优属运动和对优抚工作的检查，使优抚工作有了广阔深入的发展，特别是对改进代耕工作、帮助烈属、军属生产就业、安置和组织革命残废军人学习等方面，都获得了显著的成绩。但是，工作中创造的一些先进经验和办法，我们还研究得不够，举凡有些地方实行的代耕与合作互助组织相结合的办法，评选优抚模范的成功经验等，都有待我们总结后加以推广。还有许多需大力解决的问题，如调剂代耕负担，帮助贫苦烈士、军人子弟入学等，必须设法解决。有个别新区代耕工作虽已树立，但未形成制度，因而不能保持经常或者把代耕看成支应差事。这些缺点都应迅速克服。因此，各地必须按照指示所指的项目和精神，认真地对优抚工作进行全面检查。同时，为求做到普遍和深入，应结合一切可以结合的工作，利用
    一切可以利用的形式，如军民联欢、小型调查座谈会、优抚模范会、团拜、访问等，深入到下层，多多倾听群众的反映和意见，并作认真的研究和处理，据以做出一九五三年优抚工作的全盘计划，争取优抚工作再向前推进一步。在部队方面，我军对执行群众纪律向来就是好的，并且爱护和帮助人民群众的模范事迹已为世界人民所赞叹，这是由于毛主席直接培养和教育的结果，也是我人民军队的本质表现。但由于三年来一般部队定居的时间较久，长期借用群众住屋和家具的现象加多了，特别是进驻少数民族地区的部队，由于风俗习惯互不相同，面临的情况较为复杂，这些，都会或多或少地影响到军民的正常关系。在部队中也有少数人员滋长了功臣思想，不能正确地对待政府和群众，甚至有违法乱纪的行为。因而部队也必须按照指示，严肃地对执行群众纪律情况进行深入的检查，并对发现的问题作适当的处理。
    最后，在新年春节期间，可举行军民联欢，组织人民对军队、伤病员、革命残废军人及烈属、军属进行慰问或慰劳，更加加强军民的战斗感情，迎接胜利的一九五三年。
