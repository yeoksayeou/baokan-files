    Sanction and Strike Back at Bad Elements Who Suppress Criticism

    Today, this newspaper publishes two letters from readers Zhang Huaidao and Zhang Guanwu, exposing the serious illegal actions of the People's Court of Pingyin County and certain district and township cadres in Pingyin County in arbitrarily infringing upon human rights and suppressing criticism. It also reveals the bureaucratic attitude of the local Party organization in not seriously struggling against the phenomenon of suppressing criticism. In a people's democratic dictatorship, why should the people, as masters of the country, such as Zhang Huaidao, be suppressed for expressing dissatisfaction with illegal and undisciplined phenomena and reflecting this dissatisfaction to the newspapers for handling? What reason do cadres like Zhang Erzhu of Pingyin County, district, and township have to use the power given to them by the people to arbitrarily bully the people? The seriousness of the problem lies here. But what is especially serious is that this situation is not an isolated case, but a rather common problem among district and township cadres. This poses a serious political task for Party organizations at all levels: that is, we must continue to correct and eliminate this anti-people bureaucratic style; otherwise, it will inevitably affect the people's concern and love for the country, affect the correct implementation of national policies, and affect the seriousness of national law and Party discipline, the result of which will be the Party's detachment from the masses of the people, which is the greatest danger.

    How to fight against this bad style of violating laws and discipline and destroying the connection between the Party and the masses of the people? One of the most effective methods is to mobilize the masses to expose and report a large number of cases, and to carry out mass criticism from the bottom up. It should be pointed out that mass criticism from the bottom up cannot be carried out automatically in a spontaneous manner. The responsibility of the leadership lies in: giving strong support to every healthy criticism; and dealing seriously with the phenomenon of suppressing criticism and attacking critics. Judging from this incident published in today's newspaper, the Pingyin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has major shortcomings in this regard. They not only failed to promptly deal with the illegal and undisciplined behavior and suppression of criticism by district and township cadres such as Zhang Erzhu, but also failed to inspect and correct the Pingyin County People's Court's behavior of attacking critics and making distorted replies to the newspaper. What is especially serious is that when the "Rural Masses" newspaper forwarded the letter from Zhang Guanwu reflecting the attacks and retaliation to the County Party Committee, the County Party Committee still did not pay attention to it, and instead forwarded the letter to the suppressors of criticism for continued handling. This shows an intolerable serious bureaucratic style.

    According to the materials we have learned, this bureaucratic style of suppressing criticism exists in various places. In addition to hoping that the Pingyin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Pingyin People's Court, and the Jinan Rural Masses Newspaper will be responsible for handling this case, we also hope that the vast number of readers will boldly expose this bureaucracy and launch a mass anti-bureaucracy struggle!

    制裁打击批评的坏分子
    今天本报发表的读者张怀道和张冠五两封来信，揭发了平阴县人民法院和平阴县某些区乡干部任意侵犯人权和压制批评的严重违法行为，同时也暴露了当地党组织对压制批评的现象不作严肃斗争的官僚主义态度。在人民民主专政的国家里，作为国家主人的人民张怀道等，对违法乱纪的现象表示不满，并把这种不满的情况反映给报纸请求处理为什么会受到压制呢？平阴县、区、乡张尔朱等干部有什么理由可以借用人民给予他的职权来任意欺压人民呢？问题的严重性就在这里。但尤其严重的，是这种情况并非个别，而是区乡干部中一个相当普遍的问题。这就给各级党组织提出了一个严重的政治任务：就是我们必须继续纠正和肃清这种反人民的官僚主义作风；否则，势必影响到人民群众对国家的关心和热爱，影响到国家政策的正确贯彻，影响到国法和党纪的严肃性，其结果将会使党脱离人民群众，这是最大的危险。
    怎样向这种违法乱纪、破坏党和人民群众联系的恶劣作风进行斗争呢？最有效的方法之一，就是发动群众大量揭发和检举，开展自下而上的群众性的批评。应该指出，群众性的自下而上的批评，是不可能以自流的方式自动开展的。领导的责任就在于：对每一个健康的批评都应该给予有力的支持；对压制批评和打击批评者的现象，则必须进行严肃的处理。从本报今天发表的这一事件来看，中共平阴县委会在这一方面是有重大缺点的。他们不仅对张尔朱等区乡干部违法乱纪和压制批评的行为未及时处理，对县人民法院打击批评者和向报社作歪曲答复的行为又没有检查和纠正；尤其严重的是，当“农村大众”报把张冠五反映遭受打击和报复的信转到县委后，县委依然没有重视，又把信转给压制批评者去继续处理。这就表现了不能容忍的严重的官僚主义作风。
    根据我们了解的材料，这种压制批评的官僚主义作风，在各地都有，今天本报发表这两件来信，除了希望中共平阴县委、平阴人民法院和济南农村大众报负责处理这案而外，更望广大读者大胆地揭发这种官僚主义，展开群众性的反官僚主义斗争！
