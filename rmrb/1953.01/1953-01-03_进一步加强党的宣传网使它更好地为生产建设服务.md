Party Life

    The Party Central Committee issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses Throughout the Party" on January 1, 1951. Two full years have passed since then. Over the past two years, the propaganda network has greatly developed nationwide. According to incomplete statistics made in early December 1952, there are more than 3.79 million propagandists and more than 75,000 speakers across the country. That is to say, the party's propaganda network, composed of propagandists and speakers, has now developed into a strong propaganda force of nearly 4 million people. It is precisely because of such an organized, regularly functioning, and powerful propaganda force that the party's mass propaganda work has gradually overcome the shortcomings of lacking regularity and organization that existed in the past, and has been rapidly strengthened and developed. The facts of the past two years have fully proved that the Party's decision to establish a propaganda network is a decisive step in strengthening and improving the Party's mass propaganda work.
    In the past two years, the Party has led the people of the whole country in carrying out many great patriotic movements and democratic reform movements, such as the Resist America, Aid Korea, Land Reform, Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, Increased Production and Economy Practice, and the Patriotic Health Campaign. These movements were also great political propaganda movements. The scale of these propaganda movements and their profound and wide-ranging impact are unprecedented in the history of our Party's mass propaganda work. Relying on propagandists, speakers, and the broad masses of propaganda forces, the Party has successfully carried out these propaganda movements. In every movement, in every place, tens of thousands of propagandists were mobilized to carry out propaganda activities among the masses. As a result of these propaganda movements, the vast majority of the country's population has received propaganda and education. The achievement of such great results in these propaganda movements is inseparable from the activities of the Party's propagandists and speakers. Without the establishment of the Party's propaganda network and the active participation of speakers and propagandists, it would be difficult to imagine that these propaganda movements could reach such a wide and deep level. In every propaganda movement, as well as in daily political and production propaganda, the Party's propagandists and speakers play a leading and backbone role, and they are constantly active among the people of all strata and in various work positions together with members of various mass propaganda teams. Wherever speakers and propagandists are regularly active, the political consciousness of the masses can be continuously improved, the reactionary rumors of enemy agents can be quickly suppressed, the calls of the Party and the government can be implemented, and various tasks can be completed smoothly and quickly. Because of this, the activities of propagandists and speakers have been valued by Party organizations in various places and warmly welcomed by the people.
    Today, our Party's mass propaganda work is facing new and huge tasks. From this year on, our country has entered a period of large-scale planned construction and has begun to implement the first five-year construction plan. The goal of large-scale construction is to realize the industrialization of China. Our country's large-scale construction has begun under the circumstances of continuing the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. We must ensure that economic construction and resistance to America and aid Korea both achieve great victories in 1953. In addition, in order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction, the Communist Party of China has proposed to convene the National People's Congress and people's congresses at all levels this year. Carrying out and completing these tasks, which are of great significance to the future of our country, are the glorious and great tasks of our Party and the people of the whole country in 1953. Like many other work fronts, the Party's mass propaganda work front must also serve these work tasks well, especially the large-scale national economic construction.
    Due to the establishment and development of the propaganda network, our Party's mass propaganda work has been greatly strengthened and has achieved great results. This is a fact. However, we cannot be satisfied with this. At the same time, we must also pay attention to some serious shortcomings and weaknesses that exist in the current propaganda network work. These shortcomings and weaknesses are: First, the phenomenon of formalism in the propaganda network work is still very serious. In many places, propagandists and speakers cannot regularly play their role, or do not play their role at all, due to the lack of serious leadership from the Party committees. According to surveys in many areas, such propagandists and speakers account for almost half of the total. In addition, the quality of work of propagandists is generally still relatively low and needs to be continuously improved. Second, the development of propagandists is very uneven. In some areas, the number of propagandists is still very small; in many industrial and mining enterprises, the number of propagandists cannot meet the needs; in the basic construction departments and commercial and trade systems, the propaganda network has not been established at all, and the mass propaganda work in urban streets is also relatively weak. Third, the Party organizations in various places have relatively weak leadership over various mass propaganda and education forces (such as cultural centers, film projection teams, slide projection teams, radio stations, etc.), and have not organized them into the propaganda network to give full play to their role in propaganda and education for the people. Fourth, in the past two years, because the main force of our country has been used in social and political reforms and economic recovery and transformation, the content of our mass propaganda work has also been more focused on general political propaganda. Although some specific production propaganda has also been done, many places have done less, so there is relatively little experience in production propaganda. Obviously, if we do not quickly overcome these shortcomings and weaknesses and further strengthen and improve the work of the propaganda network, we will not be able to make our mass propaganda work fully adapt to the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction.
    In order to overcome some of the existing shortcomings and weaknesses in the propaganda network work, and to further strengthen the Party's mass propaganda work, what steps should be taken in 1953 to improve the propaganda network work?
    First, the basic principle of the propaganda network work in 1953 should be to consolidate first, and then continue to develop steadily on the basis of consolidation. In North China, Northeast China, and East China, because the number of propagandists is already relatively large, the focus this year can be on consolidation, but Party branches of propagandists that have not yet been established should be established as soon as possible; many industrial and mining enterprises and other production units, as well as basic construction departments, state-owned trade and supply and marketing cooperative systems where propagandists have not yet been established, should also be gradually established. In Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China, because the number of propagandists is still small, while carrying out consolidation work, attention should be paid to appropriate development. This development work can be carried out in conjunction with the land reform review work and the Party rectification and construction work. On a national scale, we should strive to have speakers in Party organizations at all levels above the district committee. In factories and mines, every workshop and production team should have propagandists, and in rural areas, every mutual aid team and production cooperative should have propagandists in every production team or production brigade. In this way, the activities of propagandists can be more in-depth and can be more closely integrated with production activities. At the same time, in accordance with the conditions of propagandists, the heads and activists of various mass propaganda organizations, such as reading group leaders, readers, blackboard newspaper team leaders, cultural center directors and other main staff of cultural centers, captains and backbone members of mass propaganda teams, main members of amateur theater troupes, rural and street librarians, radio operators, and projectionists of film and slide projection teams should be gradually absorbed to serve as Party propagandists, so that the activities of speakers and propagandists can be directly combined with the activities of these mass propaganda organizations. Propagandists should be quickly established in basic construction units and commercial and trade systems to strengthen the Party's mass propaganda work in these departments.
    Second, Party committees at all levels should conscientiously strengthen their leadership and assistance to propagandists, and strive to make propagandists and speakers universally play their role. In this regard, the most important thing is to do the following three things: 1. Persist in implementing various systems. In accordance with the decision of the Central Committee, various systems such as branch propagandist meetings, propagandist representative meetings, and transmission stations should be conscientiously established. The county should regularly convene propagandist representative meetings, but there is no need to open too many meetings, so as not to delay production too much. According to the experience of various places, it can be convened once every three months. In the past, some counties convened it once a month. The propagandist needed a total of five days to go back and forth to attend a meeting, which required 60 days per person per year, which hindered production too much. In the future, all localities should pay attention to this issue. In addition to convening propagandist representative meetings in the county, the county party committee can also send people to the district to convene propagandist representative meetings separately when necessary. Because urban areas have convenient transportation conditions, propagandist representative meetings can still be convened on a monthly basis. In addition, the province can convene a provincial model propagandist representative meeting once a year to exchange and summarize the experience of propagandist work. For the work of speakers, we must implement the reporting card system, the party committee secretary must personally lead the work of the speakers, and the propaganda department of the party committee must assist the party committee secretary to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the work of the speakers. 2. Train propagandists. Efforts should be made to train propagandists universally this year. The county party committee can adopt a centralized training method to give short-term training to the backbone of the propagandists (including branch secretaries). Other propagandists can be trained in short-term training by the district party committee through amateur training (that is, without leaving production). In industrial and mining enterprises, the party committee should be responsible for training. The purpose of the training should be to enable propagandists to understand the basic tasks of propagandists, the basic methods of propaganda work, the current situation, national tasks and basic policies. In addition, some technical education on advanced production experience can also be carried out. Many places have already done this in the past, and their experience has proved that this is an important method to improve the level of propagandist work. 3. Systematically supply propaganda materials. All localities must do a good job in publishing the propagandist handbook. The propagandist handbook published by each province should be specifically for rural propagandists. Provinces that have not yet published the propagandist handbook should set up a regular column of propagandist speaking materials in the provincial newspaper or provincial peasant newspaper. Where there are provincial peasant newspapers, there is no need to publish the propagandist handbook, but strengthen the work of the peasant newspaper, and the task of supplying materials to propagandists can be borne by the peasant newspaper. The task of supplying materials to propagandists in industrial and mining areas can be borne by newspapers in cities and industrial and mining areas. These newspapers should also open a regular column for workers' propagandist speaking materials.
    Third, Party committees at all levels should pay serious attention to the political and ideological leadership of various mass propaganda and education organizations such as cultural centers, film projection teams, slide projection teams, and radio stations. Party committees must not push the responsibility for this ideological leadership to the government's business departments, nor should they confuse the responsibility for this ideological leadership with the administrative leadership responsibility of relevant government departments. In order to strengthen the leadership over these mass propaganda organizations, the provincial party committee should regularly convene some professional propaganda work meetings to study the work of these mass propaganda education organizations separately. For example, the provincial party committee can convene a meeting on the work of cultural centers every year to study and improve the work of cultural centers; convene a meeting of all film projection team personnel in the province every year to check and study their work, and conduct certain political and ideological education for them to improve the propaganda work in film projection. In addition, in cities, attention should be paid to strengthening the leadership of street mass propaganda teams to gradually strengthen the Party's propaganda work in the streets.
    Fourth, in future mass propaganda work, special attention must be paid to strengthening production propaganda and putting production propaganda, especially the propaganda of production technology, in an important position. Because only in this way can our propaganda work have a more practical role in promoting production and construction. To this end, propagandists in factories and mines and in rural areas should pay attention to learning production technology, mastering advanced production experience, and strengthening the propaganda of popularizing advanced production experience. Whether in industry or agriculture, the popularization of advanced production experience is of paramount importance for improving production and improving product quality. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of propagandists in factories and mines and in rural areas is to strive to master and publicize these advanced experiences and play a practical leading role in learning and popularizing advanced experiences. In order to improve the propaganda of production technology and advanced production experience, in addition to urging young propagandists to work hard to learn production technology, in the future, we should also pay attention to absorbing some industrial and agricultural labor models, skilled technical workers, farmers with production experience, and technicians who meet the conditions of propagandists to serve as Party propagandists, or try to get their assistance when propagandists carry out propaganda about production technology. In addition, some propaganda forms suitable for production propaganda have been created in various places, such as the red flag competition in industrial and mining enterprises, the advanced production experience performance meeting, the technical summary meeting, and the production comparison movement in rural areas, and on-the-spot visits. These forms should be well promoted and improved. While strengthening production propaganda, we should continue to pay attention to carrying out political propaganda, especially paying attention to strengthening the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea. In rural and urban residents, the "Patriotic Inspection Day" gathering system should be gradually and universally promoted once every week or half a month; in factories, schools, and institutions, the work of speakers should also be seriously strengthened, so that all personnel in factories, schools, and institutions can often hear the reports of speakers, so as to establish regular current political learning. It is necessary to closely integrate political propaganda with production propaganda, both to politically inspire the enthusiasm of workers and peasants for production and construction, and to promote advanced production experience in production. In mass propaganda work, we should not only oppose the doctrinaire tendency of only doing general political propaganda without being able to connect to production tasks and specific problems in production, but also oppose the empiricist tendency of only doing simple production technology propaganda without being able to point out the political significance of production. In 1953, the political content of our mass propaganda was to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and strive for a greater victory in resisting America and aiding Korea; it was to begin the implementation of the country's first five-year plan for construction and complete and overfulfill the 1953 construction plan; it was to convene the National People's Congress, draft the election law draft and the constitution draft, and pass the national construction plan. Our daily production propaganda among workers and peasants should be closely linked to the above-mentioned current political tasks of the people of the whole country, so as to unite and mobilize the people of the whole country, and through their active production activities and social activities, to implement and complete these major national tasks.
    The above are some issues that must be paid special attention to in the future work of the propaganda network. We believe that the smooth resolution of these problems can further strengthen the Party's propaganda network work, so as to better serve the country's tasks in 1953, first of all, economic construction tasks.

    进一步加强党的宣传网使它更好地为生产建设服务
    一九五一年一月一日党中央发布了“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，从那时到现在，已经整整两年了。两年来，宣传网在全国已有极大的发展，据一九五二年十二月初所作的不完全统计，全国共有宣传员三百七十九万多人，报告员七万五千多人。这就是说，党所建立的宣传员、报告员网现在已发展成为一支拥有近四百万人的强大的宣传队伍。正是因为有了这样一支有组织的经常起作用的强有力的宣传队伍，党的群众宣传工作才能逐渐克服了过去所存在着的缺乏经常性和组织性的缺点，而迅速地加强和发展起来。两年来的事实已充分证明，党关于建立宣传网的决定，是加强和改进党的群众宣传工作的一个决定性步骤。
    两年来党领导着全国人民进行了许多伟大的爱国运动和民主改革运动，如抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”、增产节约、爱国卫生等运动，这些运动同时也就是伟大的政治宣传运动。这些宣传运动的规模之大及其影响之深和广，在我们党的群众宣传工作的历史上是空前的。党依靠着宣传员、报告员和广大的群众宣传力量，胜利地进行了这些宣传运动。在每一个运动中，在每一处地方，都是动员了成千上万的宣传人员向群众进行宣传活动。这些宣传运动的结果，都使全国绝大多数人口受到了宣传教育。这些宣传运动之所以能获得这样巨大的成绩，是和党的宣传员、报告员的活动分不开的。假如没有党的宣传网的建立，没有报告员、宣传员的积极活动，我们就很难设想，这些宣传运动能够达到如此广泛深入的程度。在每一个宣传运动中，以及在日常的政治和生产的宣传中，党的宣传员和报告员都起着带头和骨干的作用，他们和各种群众宣传队伍的成员在一起，经常地在各阶层人民群众中，在各种工作岗位上活动着。凡是有报告员和宣传员经常活动的地方，群众的政治觉悟都能不断地提高，敌人特务的反动谣言都能迅速地扑灭，党和政府的号召都能贯彻执行，各种工作都能顺利地和迅速地完成。正是因为这样，所以宣传员、报告员的活动才受到各地党的组织的重视，并受到人民群众的热烈欢迎。
    我们党的群众宣传工作，今天又面临着新的巨大的任务。从今年起，我们的国家已进入大规模的有计划的建设时期，开始实行第一个五年建设计划。大规模建设的目标就是实现中国的工业化。我们国家的大规模建设是在继续进行抗美援朝斗争的情况下开始的，我们必须使经济建设和抗美援朝在一九五三年同时都取得伟大的胜利。此外，为了适应国家经济建设的需要，中国共产党已提议在今年召开全国人民代表大会和各级人民代表大会。进行和完成这些对于我们国家的未来前途有着伟大意义的工作，就是我们党和全国人民在一九五三年的光荣而伟大的任务。和其他许多工作战线一样，党的群众宣传工作战线也必须很好地为这些工作任务特别是为国家大规模经济建设服务。
    由于宣传网的建立和发展，我们党的群众宣传工作已极大地加强起来，并获得了巨大的成绩，这是事实。但是我们并不能因此而满足。我们同时必须注意到目前宣传网工作中存在的一些严重的缺点和弱点。这些缺点和弱点：是第一，宣传网工作中的形式主义现象还很严重。很多地方的宣传员、报告员，由于党委缺乏认真的领导，以致不能经常起作用，或者根本不起作用。据许多地区的调查，这样的宣传员、报告员几乎占了总数的一半。此外，现在宣传员的工作质量一般还比较低，还需要继续加以提高。第二，宣传员的发展还很不平衡，有些地区宣传员数量还非常少；有许多工矿企业中的宣传员数量也还不能满足需要；在基本建设部门和商业贸易系统中，还根本未建立起宣传网来，城市街道的群众宣传工作也比较薄弱。第三，各地党的组织对于各种群众宣传教育力量（如文化馆、放映队、幻灯队、收音站等）的领导比较薄弱，没有把它们组织在宣传网中，充分发挥它们对人民的宣传教育作用。第四，过去两年来，由于我们国家的主要力量是用在社会政治改革及经济的恢复和改造方面，所以我们的群众宣传工作的内容也比较偏重于一般性的政治宣传，具体的生产宣传虽也做了一些，但许多地方做得较少，所以在生产宣传方面比较缺少经验。很显然，如果我们不迅速克服这些缺点和弱点，进一步加强和改进宣传网工作，我们就无法使我们的群众宣传工作充分适应国家大规模经济建设的需要。
    为了克服宣传网工作中现存的一些缺点和弱点，以进一步加强党的群众宣传工作，在一九五三年内对改进宣传网工作应当采取一些什么步骤呢？
    第一，在一九五三年内宣传网工作的基本方针应是以巩固为主，在巩固的基础上继续稳步地发展。华北、东北及华东等地因宣传员数量已较大，在今年内可着重于巩固，但尚未建立宣传员的党支部则应尽快建立起来；尚未建立宣传员的许多工矿企业单位及其他生产单位，以及基本建设部门、国营贸易及供销合作社系统，也应逐步地建立起来。中南、西南和西北等地，因宣传员数量尚少，在进行巩固工作的同时，应注意适当地发展，这种发展工作可结合土地改革复查工作和整党建党工作去进行。就全国范围说，应争取在区委以上的各级党组织中都有报告员。在工矿中，使每一个车间及生产小组都有宣传员，在农村中每一个互助组和生产合作社里的每个生产小组或生产队都有宣传员。这样就可以使宣传员的活动更加深入，并可以和生产活动更密切地结合起来。同时应按照宣传员条件逐步吸收各种群众宣传组织的负责人和积极分子，如读报组长、读报员、黑板报小组长，文化馆长及文化馆的其他主要工作人员，群众宣传队的队长和骨干分子，业余剧团的主要人员，农村及街道的图书馆长，收音员，电影队和幻灯队的放映员等，充当党的宣传员，以便使报告员、宣传员的活动和这些群众宣传组织的活动直接结合起来。应该迅速地在基本建设单位和商业贸易系统中建立起宣传员来，以加强党在这些部门的群众宣传工作。
    第二，各级党委应认真加强对宣传员的领导和帮助，争取使宣传员、报告员普遍发生作用。在这方面，最主要的是做好下列三件事 ：一、坚持实行各项制度。应该遵照中央的决定，认真建立起支部宣传员会议、宣传员代表会议及传授站等各项制度。县要经常召开宣传员代表会议，但也不需开得过多，以免过多地耽误生产，按照各地经验，每三个月召开一次即可。过去有些县每月召开一次，宣传员为参加一次会议，连往返共需五天时间，一年每人即需六十天，这样就过多地妨碍了生产，今后各地应注意这一问题。除在县召开宣传员代表会议外，必要时，县委还可派人到区分别召开宣传员代表会议。城市因交通条件方便，宣传员代表会议仍可按月召开。此外，省每年可召开一次全省的模范宣传员代表会议，以交流和总结宣传员工作的经验。对报告员工作，一定要实行报告卡片制度，党委书记一定要亲自领导报告员的工作，党委宣传部一定要协助党委书记加强对报告员工作的督促和检查。二、训练宣传员。应该争取在今年内将宣传员普遍地加以训练。县委可采取集中训练的办法，将宣传员的骨干（包括支部书记）加以短期训练。其他宣传员，可由区委采取业余训练（即不脱离生产）的办法，轮流加以短期训练。在工矿企业中，应该由党委负责加以训练。训练的目的应该是使宣传员了解宣传员的基本任务、宣传工作的基本方法、当前形势、国家任务和基本政策，此外，还可进行一些有关先进生产经验的技术教育。过去有许多地方已经这样做，他们的经验证明，这是提高宣传员工作水平的一个重要方法。三、有系统地供给宣传材料。各地一定要把宣传员手册办好。各省出版的宣传员手册应专以农村宣传员为对象。尚未办宣传员手册的省，应在省报或省农民报上辟定期的宣传员讲话材料专栏。有省农民报的地方，可不再出版宣传员手册，而加强农民报的工作，供给宣传员材料的任务可交由农民报负担。供给工矿宣传员材料的任务，可由城市和工矿区的报纸去负担，这些报纸也应辟出定期的工人宣传员讲话材料专栏。
    第三，各级党委应当认真注意对文化馆、电影放映队、幻灯放映队、收音站等各种群众宣传教育组织的政治思想领导。党委不能把这种思想领导的责任推给政府的业务部门去管，也不应把这种思想领导的责任和政府有关部门的行政领导责任混同起来。为了加强对这些群众宣传组织的领导，省委应经常召开一些专业性的宣传工作会议，分别研究这些群众宣传教育组织的工作。例如，省委每年可召开一次关于文化馆工作的会议，研究和改进文化馆的工作；每年召开一次全省电影放映队人员的会议，检查和研究他们的工作，并对他们进行一定的政治思想的教育，改进电影放映中的宣传工作。此外，在城市中，应注意加强对街道群众宣传队的领导，以逐步加强党在街道中的宣传工作。
    第四，在今后的群众宣传工作中，必须特别注意加强生产宣传，把生产宣传特别是生产技术的宣传提到重要地位上来。因为只有这样，我们的宣传工作才能对生产建设起更实际的推动作用。为此，工矿和农村中的宣传员应当注意学习生产技术，掌握先进生产经验，加强推广先进生产经验的宣传。无论在工业和农业中，推广先进生产经验，对于提高生产和改进产品质量都是具有头等重要意义的事情。所以工矿和农村中的宣传员最重要的任务之一，就是努力掌握和宣传这些先进经验，并在学习和推广先进经验中起实际的带头作用。为了改进对生产技术和先进生产经验的宣传，除了督促青年宣传员努力学习生产技术以外，今后并应注意吸收一部分够宣传员条件的工业和农业的劳动模范、熟练的技术工人、有生产经验的农民以及技术人员充当党的宣传员，或设法使宣传员在进行关于生产技术的宣传时取得他们的协助。此外，现在各地已创造了一些适于进行生产宣传的宣传形式，如工矿企业中的红旗竞赛、先进生产经验表演会、技术总结会及农村中的生产评比运动、实地参观等，这些形式应很好地加以推广和提高。在加强生产宣传的同时，应继续注意进行政治的宣传，特别是注意加强抗美援朝的宣传。在农村和城市居民中，应逐步普遍地推行每一周或半个月一次的“爱国检查日”集会制度；在工厂、学校和机关中，也应当认真加强报告员的工作，使工厂、学校、机关的全体人员经常听得到报告员的报告，借以建立经常的时事政治学习。必须使政治的宣传和生产的宣传密切结合起来，既在政治上鼓舞工人农民的生产建设热情，又在生产上推广先进生产经验。在群众宣传工作中，应该既要反对只作一般的政治宣传而不能联系到生产任务和生产中的具体问题的教条主义倾向，又要反对只作单纯的生产技术宣传而不能指明生产的政治意义的经验主义倾向。在一九五三年，我们的群众宣传的政治内容，就是继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，争取抗美援朝的更大胜利；就是开始执行国家建设的第一个五年计划，完成和超额完成一九五三年度建设计划；就是召集全国人民代表大会，起草选举法草案和宪法草案，并通过国家建设计划。应当使我们在工人农民中的日常的生产宣传密切联系到上述全国人民的当前政治任务，以便团结和动员全国人民，经过他们的积极的生产活动和社会活动，去执行和完成这些重大的国家任务。
    以上就是今后宣传网工作中必须特别注意的一些问题。我们相信，这些问题的顺利解决，就可以使党的宣传网工作进一步加强起来，以便更好地为一九五三年的国家任务首先是经济建设任务服务。
