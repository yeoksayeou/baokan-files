    Cooperatives Should Continue to Strengthen the Autumn Grain Procurement Work
    In 1952, agricultural production across the country generally achieved a bumper harvest, and farmers had more grain to sell than in previous years. The country's large-scale economic construction has begun, the urban population is gradually increasing, and urban and industrial and mining areas need a large amount of grain. Farmers in cash crop areas also urgently need grain. At the same time, we must also export some grain in exchange for some necessities. This situation most powerfully demonstrates that we must increase the quantity of commodity grain and that it is possible to increase the quantity of commodity grain.
    In order to ensure that the state can control enough commodity grain and meet the grain sales requirements of the vast number of farmers, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives across the country have comprehensively and actively launched grain procurement work. Cooperatives have played a significant role in the grain procurement work. The number of grain purchase points of cooperatives in Guannei (inside the passes, i.e., inland China) is 2.3 times that of state-owned grain companies. The proportion of grain purchased by cooperatives generally accounts for 40% to 50% of the amount purchased by state-owned grain departments. In some places, the proportion of cooperative purchases has reached about 70%. According to statistics as of mid-December last year, cooperatives in Guannei had completed 151.99% of the annual plan for rice purchases and 109.88% of the annual plan for coarse grain purchases. However, this is still not enough to fully meet farmers' grain sales requirements, the state's need for grain, and the needs of farmers in economic crop areas. The fact that grain market prices are higher than listed prices in some economic crop areas where the grain supply falls short of demand is a powerful illustration of this.
    At present, the collection of agricultural tax for 1952 has been largely completed. Farmers are actively preparing for reproduction. In addition, with the Spring Festival approaching, farmers need to sell grain to exchange for means of production and New Year goods. Moreover, according to general practice, farmers always leave 30% to 40% of the autumn grain to be sold in the second year. This requires cooperatives in various places to accept the experience of grain purchase in 1952 and vigorously purchase grain starting from 1953, and strive to complete the new grain purchase tasks.
    Past experience in grain procurement work has proven that improving procurement methods and simplifying procurement procedures are effective ways to facilitate farmers' grain sales and accelerate the progress of procurement work. In order to facilitate farmers' grain sales, the Xihetou Cooperative in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, invited local farmers to select representatives from each mutual aid team on the basis of natural villages to contact the cooperative and notify the cooperative of the amount of rice to be sold within the team. The cooperative then went to the countryside for procurement on the agreed date. The procurement was carried out by team, and after weighing, the farmers carried the grain to the boat, and the team leader settled the accounts uniformly. The advantages of adopting this method are: after the cooperative purchases the grain, it can directly send the grain to the grain company's warehouse, saving transportation costs and reducing storage consumption. At the same time, it can also save farmers' time and manpower. Cooperatives in various counties in Jiangsu Province and some county-level cooperatives in Hunan Province use uniform grain containers when weighing, which greatly saves the time for returning the skin and increases the weighing efficiency by one to two times. Kunshan County Cooperative in Jiangsu Province adopted the method of registered registration and weighing according to the number, which made the grain purchase work well-organized. These grain purchase methods should be promoted in order to correct the current phenomenon of cumbersome grain purchase procedures and low efficiency in some areas.
    Secondly, in the grain procurement work, it is necessary to conscientiously grade and price the grain and master the quality of the grain. In order to improve the quality of grain purchased, many cooperatives in various places have not only strengthened publicity and education to farmers, so that farmers consciously dry and clean the grain, but also actively improved the acceptance technology. However, some cooperative cadres have not mastered the quality of grain well and have not graded and priced it well, which has made some farmers feel dissatisfied. For example, cooperatives in Xindeng and Cixi counties in Zhejiang Province calculate the intermediate price as the highest price; the Zhengge, Zhongbao, and Liujiang cooperatives in Hongya County, Sichuan Province, do not carry out purchases according to the principle of grading and pricing, and so on. The cadres of these cooperatives have not fully realized that grading and pricing is the key to doing a good job in procurement. Of course, cooperatives in various places lack inspection instruments, and there are many difficulties in inspecting grain grades, but the phenomenon of lowering the purchase grade and not carrying out purchases according to the principle of grading and pricing is not caused by the lack of inspection instruments, but by the simple task perspective and irresponsible work style of the cooperative cadres. This phenomenon cannot be allowed to continue, and various places should immediately correct it.
    Third, grain procurement must be combined with the supply of materials. Many cooperatives in various places have paid attention to organizing the supply of various living materials and means of production, and have met the needs of farmers after selling grain. For example, cooperatives in northern Jiangsu Province supplied various commodities in rice purchase areas, and the amount of currency withdrawn generally accounted for 50% to 70% of the amount put in, thus making the grain purchase work proceed smoothly, and the farmers were very satisfied. However, in some grain purchase areas, the failure of cooperatives to attach importance to the supply of materials or the untimely supply has affected the development of grain purchase work. Cooperatives in southern Jiangsu Province failed to complete the task of purchasing rice due to the lack of bran and rice bran supply to farmers. This shows that if the procurement work is separated from the supply of materials, it will not meet the needs of farmers and will also affect the progress of the procurement work. Cooperatives in various places must attach importance to the supply of materials in the future.
    Finally, attention should be paid to strengthening the transportation and storage of grain. In the past, in many areas, due to insufficient warehouses and lack of transportation capacity, after purchasing grain, a large amount of grain was accumulated in cooperatives. Huanggang in Hubei, Pingjiang and Hanshou in Hunan and other counties had stopped purchasing due to excessive accumulation of grain and few warehouses. Yingshan Cooperative in Sichuan proposed three "no purchases" because of few warehouses and difficulties in storage: "no purchase in rain, no purchase in the market, no purchase when there are many people," which aroused great dissatisfaction among local farmers. In individual areas, due to excessive accumulation of grain and poor storage, the phenomenon of grain mildew has occurred, causing unnecessary losses to state property. In the future, cooperatives in various places should vigorously strengthen transportation and warehousing work in grain purchase work to ensure that grain is transported as soon as it is purchased and avoid accumulation. In addition to timely cooperating with the grain department for transportation, cooperatives in various places must also actively seek the assistance of local party and government leading organs in order to solve the problems of warehousing and transportation in a timely manner.

### 合作社应继续加强秋粮收购工作

    合作社应继续加强秋粮收购工作
    一九五二年全国各地农业生产普遍丰收，农民有比往年更多的粮食需要出售；国家大规模的经济建设已经开始，城市人口逐渐增加，城市和工矿区域需要大量粮食；经济作物地区的农民需粮也很迫切；同时，我们还要出口一部分粮食，换回一些必需品。这种情况，最有力地说明了我们必须增加商品粮食的数量，也可能增加商品粮食的数量。
    全国各地国营粮食部门和合作社，为了保证国家能掌握足够的商品粮食，满足广大农民售粮的要求，曾经全面地积极地展开购粮工作。在购粮工作中，合作社发挥的作用很大。关内各地合作社的粮食收购点相当于国营粮食公司收购点的二点三倍。合作社收购粮食的比重一般占国营粮食部门收购量的百分之四十到五十。有的地方合作社收购比重已达百分之七十左右。截至去年十二月中旬的统计，关内合作社收购大米已完成去年全年计划百分之一五一点九九，收购杂粮完成去年全年计划百分之一零九点八八。但是，这还不能完全满足农民售粮的要求，还不能完全满足国家对粮食的需要，也还不能满足经济作物区农民对粮食的需要。部分经济作物地区粮食供不应求，因而发生了粮食市价高于牌价的现象，就是有力的说明。
    目前，一九五二年农业税的征收工作已大体完成，农民正在积极准备进行再生产，加以春节在即，农民需要售粮换购生产资料和年货。而且根据一般的习惯，农民每年总要留下百分之三十至四十的秋粮在第二年出售。这就要求各地合作社接受一九五二年购粮的经验，从一九五三年开始即大力收购粮食，为完成新的购粮任务而努力。
    过去购粮工作的经验证明，改进购粮方法和简化收购手续，是便利农民售粮，加速购粮工作进行的有效方法。江苏省无锡西河头合作社为便利农民售粮，请当地农民以自然村为单位、由每个互助组选出代表与合作社联系，把组内需要出售的稻谷数量通知合作社，由合作社按约定日期下乡收购；收购时按组进行，过磅后由农民挑送上船，小组长统一结账。采用这一办法的好处是：合作社收购后可以直接把粮食送到粮食公司仓库，节省调运运费，减少保管仓耗，同时还可以节省农民的时间和人力。江苏省各县合作社及湖南省有些县级合作社，在过秤时采用统一的盛粮器具，大大节省了回皮时间，使过秤效率提高了一倍至两倍。江苏省昆山县合作社采用挂号登记、按号过磅的办法，使购粮工作井然有序。这些购粮方法均应推广，以便纠正目前有些地区购粮手续繁琐、效率不高的现象。
    其次，在购粮工作中要认真地分等论价，掌握粮食品质。各地不少合作社为了提高收购粮食的品质，除对农民加强宣传教育，使农民自觉地把粮食晒干扬净外，并积极改进了验收技术。但是有些合作社的干部还没有很好掌握粮食品质，没有很好地分等论价，使部分农民感到不满。如浙江省新登、慈溪县合作社以中间价作为最高价计算；四川省洪雅县的正戈、中保、柳江合作社不按分等论价的原则进行收购，等等。这些合作社的干部还没有充分认识到分等论价是作好收购工作的关键。固然，各地合作社缺乏检验仪器，在检验粮食等级时有不少困难，但是这种压低收购等级、不按分等论价的原则进行收购的现象，却不是没有检验仪器造成的，而是合作社干部的单纯任务观点和不负责任的作风所造成的。这种现象是不能允许继续存在的，各地应即加以纠正。
    第三，收购粮食必须与物资供应工作相结合。各地不少合作社已注意组织各种生活资料与生产资料的供应，满足了农民售粮后的需要。例如江苏北部各地的合作社在购稻区供应了各种商品，回笼货币一般占投放数的百分之五十至七十，因而使购粮工作顺利展开，农民很是满意。但是有些购粮地区，因为合作社不重视物资供应工作或供应得不及时，都曾影响了购粮工作的开展。江苏南部各地合作社由于缺乏麸皮和米糠供应农民，没有完成收购稻谷任务。这说明了收购工作如果与物资供应工作脱节，就不能满足农民需要，也会影响收购工作的进行。各地合作社今后必须重视物资供应工作。
    最后，应注意加强粮食的运输与保管工作。过去不少地区因为仓库不足，运输力缺乏，收购粮食以后，大量积压在合作社里。湖北的黄冈，湖南的平江、汉寿等县曾因积压粮食过多、仓库很少而停止收购。四川营山合作社因仓库少，保管有困难，提出三不收：“下雨不收，赶场不收，人多不收”，引起当地农民的很大不满。个别地区因粮食积压过多，保管不善，已发生粮食霉烂现象，造成国家财产不应有的损失。今后，各地合作社在购粮工作中应大力加强调运和仓储工作，保证随收随运，避免积压现象。各地合作社除应及时配合粮食部门调运之外，还必须主动地争取当地党政领导机关的协助，以便及时解决仓储与运输问题。
