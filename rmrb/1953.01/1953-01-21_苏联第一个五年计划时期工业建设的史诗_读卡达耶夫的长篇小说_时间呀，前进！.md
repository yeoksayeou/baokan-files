    An Epic of Industrial Construction During the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan
    --Reading Katayev's novel "Time, Forward!"
  　Lu Xizhi
    Katayev's novel "Time, Forward!" is a vivid record of the great days of the Soviet people implementing the first Five-Year Plan.

    What were the tasks of the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction? "The fundamental task of the Five-Year Plan is to create in our country a heavy industry capable of reorganizing and restructuring not only the entire industry, but also the transport system and agriculture, on socialist principles." (Stalin, "Problems of Leninism," p. 495) To ensure the completion, even ahead of schedule, of such a plan, a high speed of construction was required, a "militant Bolshevik tempo." Stalin said at the First All-Union Conference of Workers in Socialist Industry: "People sometimes ask: Cannot the speed be reduced somewhat, the rate of progress slowed down? No, it is impossible, comrades! Absolutely impossible to reduce the speed! ... To slow down means to lag behind. And those who lag behind get beaten. ... There is one point in the history of old Russia, and that is that it was constantly beaten because of its backwardness." ("Problems of Leninism," p. 443) Stalin emphasized that the distance of fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced capitalist countries should be covered within ten years. Therefore, Mayakovsky's line of poetry "Time, Forward!" became a powerful slogan in the construction at that time. Katayev used this slogan as the title of his novel.

    Katayev expresses the theme of "speed" profoundly and fully in this novel. He demonstrates the heroic spirit of the Soviet working class in striving to accelerate the speed of construction through a socialist competition in a construction zone. The entire book is filled with the boiling scene of the large-scale economic construction of the Soviet state. The construction zone is changing its face every moment. New miracles are constantly emerging, and new figures are constantly emerging and growing. "Statistics cannot keep up with life, and time leaves rows of numbers behind." The main project of the construction zone—the iron-smelting furnace—"In the morning, it had only eight floors. Now, it has nine. The tenth floor is under construction." What a powerful and truthful description!

    The story takes place in a great construction zone—the famous Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine (the novel does not mention this location, but according to Katayev's own account recorded in Comrade Kang Zhuo's "Notes on Katayev"[Note], the construction zone described in the novel is this location). A shocking message reached this construction zone: the concrete workers in the city of Kharkov had created a world record by completing 306 batches of concrete in one shift. The best concrete workers in this construction zone, however, only made 200 batches per shift.

    Beat Kharkov? Or not?

    A struggle between two ideologies unfolds in the novel. The conservative, represented by the chief engineer on duty, Nalbandov, the supervisor of the construction zone, spread the idea of opposing acceleration and opposing competition: construction is not a competition! The conservative's "scientific basis" was: textbooks say that it is against the rules to make one batch of concrete in less than two minutes (Kharkov's record was ninety seconds per batch), and the concrete mixer's manual also has restrictions on speed. Nalbandov was a stickler for the rules, and he believed that the attempt to defeat Kharkov was a violation of all traditions and was utter foolishness and technical ignorance.

    The one who resolutely fought against Nalbandov was Megali, the young engineer and section chief of the sixth section of the construction zone.

    Megali understood: construction is certainly not a competition, but what is important is: the industrial construction plan must be completed, and the furnaces must be started within forty-six days—that is the significance of the competition. He proposed "We can try to defeat Kharkov."

    The struggle between Megali and Nalbandov represents the struggle between two old and new ideologies, which has profound significance in the entire socialist construction. Nalbandov repeatedly emphasized the "accepted traditions" of science, but Megali believed: "Science should be viewed with a dialectical eye. Some scientific hypotheses of yesterday have become accepted facts today; and some accepted facts of today are not applicable to tomorrow and become relics of the past." He believed that the rule stipulated in textbooks that one batch of concrete could not be made in less than two minutes was not very important. Textbooks are revised and supplemented every year, and the manuals of machines in capitalist countries are even less reliable.

    Megali represented the thinking of an advanced Soviet engineer. He was by no means a "blindly doing fellow" as Nalbandov said. He did not ignore science at all; on the contrary, he emphasized that experiments must be carried out according to strict scientific rules and on a strict scientific basis in order to achieve high speed. He made a long-distance call to Moscow to ask for a copy of the "latest analytical algorithm." Before he received the "latest analytical algorithm," he refused to issue the order for the competition. Through the long-distance call, Moscow gave him something even better: the content of an article published in a Soviet newspaper that day, "Accelerating the Preparation and Production of Advanced Concrete." This article pointed out: "The achievements of some shock worker teams in some construction areas, who have brought the efficiency of machines to the fullest, are phenomena of great social and economic significance. These achievements refute all conservative ideas on this issue." The article then provided a detailed and precise scientific analysis of the increase in concrete production speed and the guarantee of quality. It was from this article that Megali obtained the theoretical basis for "We can try to defeat Kharkov."

    Megali made full preparations before starting the competition. He prepared the supply of materials, he rationally arranged transportation and material handling, he correctly allocated manpower, he arranged for emergency repairs, and then the competition began. After the competition was won, he stipulated restrictions on the speed for the next shift's work team. Before he was sure that the quality of the concrete produced at this high speed was qualified (the quality of the concrete would be determined by the laboratory in seven days), he did not allow an increase in production, he "must be responsible to the Party for his orders."

    Megali also deeply understood the great significance of increasing the productivity of a machine. All the machines in the Soviet Union form a complex chain system. To increase the speed of any department in this system, the speed of the entire system must be increased. Increasing the productivity of a concrete mixer may seem like a small thing at first glance, but it is actually related to the entire huge, complex, important, and interacting system of the Five-Year Plan—it is, to a certain extent, getting closer to the socialist era.

    Through the thoughts, feelings, and actions of this young engineer, Megali, Katayev created an image of a heroic Soviet industrial builder. "To him, time is not an abstract concept. He and time are not really incompatible. They move forward together, with no one lagging behind or going ahead, knee to knee, like two runners, or like a runner and his shadow, recognizing seconds by fleeting eyes and palms."

    In contrast to Megali, the conservative Nalbandov despised the new forces. "He hated Megali. People regarded Megali as the best leader, as the idol of the workers, as the darling of the construction zone, and he could not forgive this reputation. Because compared to Nalbandov, what was Megali after all?" He had no enthusiasm for the earth-shaking socialist construction, and he even eagerly hoped that Megali's significant experiment would fail. He was such a decadent, selfish person, and this conservative, decadent ideology was a serious obstacle to construction.

    The "Concise History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" quoted Stalin's words when discussing socialist competition: "Socialist competition demonstrates a brilliant model of striving for labor and a new attitude towards labor. Workers and collective farmers...demonstrated a model of heroic work. They not only implemented but also exceeded the socialist construction plans formulated by the Party and the government. People's views on labor have changed. Under the capitalist system, labor is a compulsory and forced obligation, but now labor has become a 'glorious cause, a glorious career, a heroic and courageous cause'." (Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, p. 364)

    The novel fully demonstrates this "glorious cause, glorious career, heroic and courageous cause."

    All the supervisors, shock brigade leaders, and members of the shock brigades on the construction site eagerly hoped that their shift would receive the order to compete with Kharkov and receive the honor of creating a world record. Supervisor Kornyev simply couldn't spare any time to persuade his wife, who wanted to leave the construction zone, to stay. Shock brigade leader Ishuchenko hardly had time to take his wife, who was about to give birth, to the hospital. The workers in the shock brigade competing worked nervously, it rained, they insisted on working in the rain, a storm came, they insisted on working in the storm. We must win the competition!

    When Ishuchenko's team was competing with Kharkov, Hanumov, the leader of another shock brigade, saw a trick from the side: if two levers were simply connected with a wire, the time to make one batch of concrete could be reduced by ten seconds. Hanumov initially kept this secret, and he wanted to use this trick to create a higher record when his team was working—"What a color he would show to everyone! What success he would achieve!" But in the intense and heated competition, what Hanumov valued more was no longer the "color" he wanted to show to everyone. He told Ishuchenko this trick, saying, "I would beat you even without this secret."

    The spirit of revolutionary heroism is brilliantly demonstrated here. People raised their class consciousness in the heat of construction. The ideological feelings of collectivism defeated the remnants of individualistic ideological feelings. In the great furnace of production and construction, many new people were trained.

    Countless new people grew noble and strong in construction and in labor. You can see it clearly from the Communist Party application of shock brigade leader Ishuchenko:

    "I request to join the Party. My six-month probationary period has ended. I came to the socialist construction zone from the countryside, from the collective farm, and was illiterate. Here I learned to read and write, raised my political level, and started working as a cleaner. Now I am the leader of the invincible concrete worker's third team, and I am a shock brigade leader. The work I have done has exceeded the plan by 20 to 25 percent. Here, I and the children (referring to the members of the shock brigade) defeated Kharkov and Kuznetsk and broke the world record for concrete production. Here, I understand that all the workers working for the socialist construction zone are building for themselves, so I think I should join the Party, and my children should join the Communist Youth League to help and practice the Party's overall policy."

    Countless new people grew rapidly in construction and in labor.

    The novel writes: "Time flew past them. They changed in time, as if in marching. The recruits became old soldiers, the soldiers became heroes, and the heroes became leaders."

    Millions of the working class masses grew nobler and stronger in construction and in labor, and they promoted the progress of the Five-Year Plan construction with their heroic spirit of labor.

    In the heroic labor of the working class and in the labor enthusiasm unfolded by the working class on the basis of socialist competition, the Soviet Union completed the industrial aspect of the first Five-Year Plan "in four years."

    苏联第一个五年计划时期工业建设的史诗
    ——读卡达耶夫的长篇小说“时间呀，前进！”
  　陆希治
    卡达耶夫的长篇小说“时间呀，前进！”，是苏联人民执行第一个五年计划的伟大日子的生动实录。
    苏联的社会主义建设第一个五年计划的任务是什么呢？“五年计划的基本任务，就是要在我国创立一种不仅能把全部工业，而且能把运输业和农业都按社会主义原则改造改组过来的重工业。”（斯大林：“列宁主义问题”第四九五页）要保证这样计划的完成甚至提前完成，就需要一种建设的高速度，需要“战斗性的布尔什维克的速度”。斯大林在第一次全苏联社会主义工业工作人员代表会议上说：“人们有时发问：难道不可稍许减低速度，延缓进展速率么？不行的，不可以的，同志们！决不可减低速度！……延缓速度，就是落后。而落后者是要挨打的。……旧俄罗斯的历史，其中有一点就是常因落后而挨打。”（“列宁主义问题”第四四三页）斯大林强调说，应当在十年以内跑完落后于先进资本主义国家的五十年至一百年的距离。因此，马雅可夫斯基的一句诗“时间呀，前进！”，就成为当时建设中的有力口号。卡达耶夫就把这个口号用作他的小说的题名。
    卡达耶夫在他的这部小说中把“速度”这一主题表现得深刻而丰满。他通过一个建设区的社会主义竞赛，表现了苏联工人阶级争取加快建设速度的英勇精神。全书充满着苏维埃国家大规模经济建设的沸腾的景象。建设区每时每刻都在改变着自己的面貌。新的奇迹不断产生，新的人物不断涌现、成长。“统计学追赶不上生活，时间把成行的数字丢在后边。”建设区的主要工程——熔铁炉，它“早晨，还只有八层。现在，有九层了。第十层正在建造中。”这是多么有力的真实描写！
    故事发生在一个伟大的建设区——有名的马格尼托哥尔斯克城的冶金联合工厂（小说中没有提出这个地点，据康濯同志的“记卡达耶夫”一文〔注〕中所记载的卡达耶夫的自述，小说中所写的建设区就是这个地点）。一个惊人的消息传到了这个建设区：哈尔科夫城的混合土工人们创造了世界纪录，一班完成了三百零六作混合土。而这个建设区的最优秀的混合土工人每班不过做二百作。
    战胜哈尔科夫呢？还是不？
    小说里展开了两种思想的斗争。以建设区总监——值日总工程师纳尔盆杜夫为代表的保守主义者向建设区散布了反对加快速度、反对竞赛的思想：建设不是竞技！保守主义者的“科学根据”是：教科书上说不满二分钟做一作混合土是不合规则的（哈尔科夫的记录是九十秒做一作混合土），混合土制造机的说明书也同样有限制速度的说明。纳尔盆杜夫是个墨守陈规的人，他认为战胜哈尔科夫的尝试是违反一切传统，是全然的愚蠢和技术的无知。
    坚决和纳尔盆杜夫作斗争的是建设区第六段段长——年青的工程师麦加利。
    麦加利明白：建设当然不是竞技，但重要的是：必须完成工业建设计划，必须在四十六天内开始建立炉灶——竞赛的意义是在这里。他提出“可以试一试战胜哈尔科夫。”
    麦加利和纳尔盆杜夫的斗争，代表了新旧两种思想的斗争，在整个社会主义的建设中是有深刻意义的。纳尔盆杜夫一再强调科学的“公认的传统”，可是麦加利认为：“科学应该用辩证法的眼光去看。昨天某些科学假设，今天已经成为公认的事实了；而今天某些公认的事实又不适用于明天，成为过去的陈迹了。”他认为教科书所规定的不能在不满两分钟内做一作混合土的规则，并不十分重要，教科书每年都被修正着，补充着，而资本主义国家的机器说明书更是不足为信。
    麦加利代表了先进的苏维埃工程师的思想。他决不像纳尔盆杜夫所说的那样，是一个“盲干的脚色”。他完全没有忽视科学，相反的，他强调一定要根据严格的科学规则，在严格的科学基础上进行实验，才有可能获得高速度。他打长途电话到莫斯科要一本“最新解析推算法”，在没有拿到“最新解析推算法”以前，他不肯发出竞赛的命令。通过长途电话，莫斯科给了他更好的东西：发表在当天苏联一个报纸上的“加速高等混合土的准备和生产”一文的内容。这篇文章指出：“把机器的效用发挥尽致的某些建设区域的若干工人突击队所获得的成就，是极富有社会意义和经济意义的现象。这些成就反驳了一切关于这一问题的保守观念。”文章接着对混合土生产速度的提高和对质量的保证作了详细精密的科学的分析。正是从这篇文章里，麦加利得到了“可以试一试战胜哈尔科夫”的理论根据。
    麦加利在开始竞赛以前作了充分的准备。他准备好材料的供应，他合理地安排了运输和材料的搬运，他正确地配置了人力，他安排了紧急修理，然后开始了竞赛。而在竞赛得到胜利以后，他对下一班的工作队规定了对速度的限制。在他没有确实知道在这种高速度下制造的混合土的品质是否合格以前（混合土的品质如何，要在七天后由实验所来判定），他不准增加产量，他“要对党替自己的命令负责任”。
    麦加利也深知提高一架机器的生产力的重大意义。苏联的全部机器相互形成一种复杂的连锁体系，要提高这个体系中任何部门的速度，就必须提高整个体系的速度。提高一架混合土制造机的生产力，初看起来，好像是很小的事情，其实是和全部庞大的、复杂的、重要的、有相互作用的五年计划的体系有关联——是在某种限度内更逼近了社会主义时代。
    通过这个年青的工程师麦加利的思想、感情和行动，卡达耶夫创造了一个英雄的苏维埃工业建设者的形象。“在他，时间不是抽象的观念。他和时间没有真正不协调的地方。他们俩一同前进，没有谁落后，也没有谁上先，膝头并着膝头，像两个奔跑者一样，或像奔跑者和他的影子一样，凭飞闪过去的眼睛和手掌认识秒数。”
    和麦加利相反，保守主义者纳尔盆杜夫却轻视新生的力量。“他痛恨麦加利。人家把麦加利看作最好的首长，看作工人们的偶像，看作建设区的宠儿，他不能原谅这种名誉。因为跟纳尔盆杜夫比较起来，麦加利到底算什么东西呢？”他对翻天覆地的社会主义建设没有丝毫热情，他甚至迫切希望着麦加利的具有重大意义的试验失败。他就是这样一个腐朽的、自私自利的人，这种保守的、腐朽的思想，正是建设中的严重障碍。
    “联共党史简明教程”在论述社会主义竞赛时引用斯大林的话：“社会主义竞赛表现了努力劳动和新劳动态度的灿烂模范。工人和集体农民……表现出英勇工作的模范。他们不仅执行而且超过执行了党和政府所拟定的社会主义建设计划。人们对于劳动的观点改变了。在资本主义制度下，劳动是一种强迫性和苦役式的义务，而现在劳动却变成了‘光荣的事业，荣耀的事业，豪迈和英勇的事业’”。（莫斯科外国文书籍出版局印行版，第三六四页）
    小说将这个“光荣的事业，荣耀的事业，豪迈和英勇的事业”，作了充分的表现。
    建设区工地上所有的监工、突击队长、突击队的队员们都殷切地盼望自己的一班得到和哈尔科夫竞赛的命令，得到创造世界纪录的荣誉。监督科尔尼耶夫简直抽不出一点时间去劝留他的要离开建设区的妻子。突击队长伊舒勤珂几乎没有时间把他的快要生产的妻子送到医院去。竞赛中的突击队的工人们紧张地劳动着，下雨了，他们在雨中坚持工作，风暴来了，他们在风暴中坚持工作。一定要竞赛得胜！
    当伊舒勤珂的一班在和哈尔科夫进行竞赛的时候，另一班的突击队队长哈奴摩夫在一旁看出了一个窍门：如果用一根铁丝把两根杠杆简单地联结起来，制造一作混合土的时间就可减少十秒钟。哈奴摩夫起初保守着这个秘密，他要在他的一班工作时利用这个窍门来创造出更高的纪录——“他会给大家怎样的颜色看！他会获得怎样的成功！”但在竞赛的紧张热烈的进行中，哈奴摩夫更重视的终于不是自己要给大家看的“颜色”了。他把这个窍门告诉了伊舒勤珂，说道：“没有这个秘密，我也会战胜你的。”
    革命的英雄主义精神在此得到了光辉的表现。人们在建设的热潮中提高了自己的阶级觉悟。集体主义的思想感情战胜了个人主义的思想感情的残余。在生产建设的伟大熔炉中，锻炼出了许多新人。
    无数的新人在建设中、在劳动中成长得高贵和坚强。你从突击队长伊舒勤珂的入党申请书里可以看得明白：
    “我请求入党。我的六个月候补期间已经结束了。我从乡村，从集体农庄来到社会主义建设区，目不识丁。我在这里学会了文字，提高了我的政治水准，开始作清道夫的工作。现在我是无敌的混合土工人第三班班长，我是一个突击队长。我所做的工作已经超过计划百分之二十到二十五。在这里，我同孩子们（按指突击队的队员们）战胜了哈尔科夫和库士纳茨克，突破了混合土生产的世界纪录。在这里，我懂得了一切为社会主义建设区工作的工人都是为着自己而建设，因此我认为自己应该入党，我的孩子们应该入青年团，帮助和实践党的全盘方针。”
    无数的新人在建设中、在劳动中迅速地成长起来。
    小说写道：“时间飞过他们。他们在时间中变化着，像在进军中变化着一样。新兵变成了老战士，战士变成了英雄，英雄变成了领袖。”
    千百万的工人阶级群众在建设中、在劳动中成长得更为高贵和坚强，他们以他们的英勇的劳动精神推动着五年计划建设的行进。
    在工人阶级的英勇劳动中，在工人阶级在社会主义竞赛基础上展开的劳动热潮中，苏联的第一个五年计划工业方面作到了“五年计划四年完成”。
