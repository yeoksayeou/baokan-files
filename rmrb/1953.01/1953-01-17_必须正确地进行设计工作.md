    Once the nation's basic construction plan is determined, the primary task, besides geological work, is to carry out correct design. This ensures that every newly built or renovated enterprise meets national requirements, adopts rational and advanced technical standards and norms, and rationally utilizes national investment and underground resources.
    If a factory or mine has errors in its design, even if they are only local errors, no matter how high the quality of construction, it will be impossible to compensate for the mistake. If the design progress is slow and delays the construction time, it will also affect the speed of national industrial construction. Therefore, the design of any large enterprise must take into meticulous consideration geological resources, transportation, product variety, quantity and quality, enterprise location and layout, development prospects, and coordination with other industries, from political, economic, and technical perspectives. Otherwise, it will cause huge losses to the country. The idea that basic construction is simply "building houses and installing machines" and that design is merely "drawing pictures according to patterns," and therefore neglecting and failing to strengthen leadership over design work, is wrong and harmful.
    Judging from the current situation, the contradiction between the heavy task and weak strength of national basic construction is most evident in design work. In some important industrial sectors, the existing design capacity only reaches one-fifth of the engineering needs for 1953, and some units are even less than one-fifth. This shows that increasing design capacity is urgently needed.
    To enhance design capacity, we must actively adopt a combination of long-term training and short-term training methods to cultivate design talents in a planned and large-scale manner. Long-term training is for long-term benefits, but this is too slow to address the current urgent tasks. Therefore, we must rationally use existing design cadres and give full play to their potential strength.
    In order to give full play to the existing design forces, we must oppose the departmentalism of some production units. They emphasize local needs, do not obey the unified allocation of the state, and are unwilling to concentrate their design personnel and those who can do design work in basic construction departments or important leading departments. This phenomenon is intolerable. In order to give full play to the existing design forces, we must also oppose the passive waiting mentality of some cadres. They do not actively seek ways to increase design capacity, but only hope and wait for higher authorities or personnel departments to send enough design cadres, or place their hopes on college students who have not yet graduated. There are even a few people who have no hope at all, saying: "Just do as much as you can with the available resources, why worry!" Although there are not many such people in our ranks, if we act according to their ideas, our country will not be able to start large-scale construction. This passive waiting mentality must be overcome and corrected. To enhance design capacity, we must also oppose the waste of manpower. If we do not understand how to use manpower in a concentrated and rational manner, but disperse the limited design forces, putting a few here and a few there, each place has some, but none can work independently. If we do not adopt the principle of specialization when using design personnel, and frequently change the design types of design personnel, then the design of each project cannot be completed on time; even if it is barely completed, the quality is not high, or small and minor projects are completed while large and major projects are abandoned. Therefore, we must concentrate the use of design forces, especially focusing on important engineering projects, concentrating the design of projects with similar nature and conditions, gradually implementing standard design, and specializing design personnel.
    In order to complete the current design tasks and improve design quality, we must also solve the issue of design ideology. That is to say, the design of newly built important factories and mines should resolutely adopt the Soviet Union's advanced technical standards, establish the idea of economic accounting and a global perspective in design.
    Some unit leaders and designers do not proceed from the long-term interests of the country, do not design according to the advanced standards of the Soviet Union, but continue to adopt the backward design standards of the United Kingdom and the United States. They blindly expand safety factors; only talk about appearance and do not seek practical results; do not plan product varieties and quantities according to national needs; do not pay attention to the safety of workers during operations; do not consider the rational utilization of national resources and coordination with other industries; so that newly built or renovated enterprises are mired in a state of low output, poor quality, and high costs for a long time, and accidents occur frequently, wasting national resources and causing great losses. This phenomenon is still common in our design work.
    Although our designers, after these years of education, especially after ideological transformation, have made great progress for the most part, are generally responsible in their work, and have made certain contributions to the country; however, there are still some people (including a few administrative management cadres) whose ideological transformation is very incomplete, and who still have very serious remnants or influences of bourgeois ideology. They refuse to learn or doubt the advanced design standards of the Soviet Union, and still worship the design standards of the United Kingdom and the United States; their carelessness and irresponsibility are still very serious; they ignore advanced experience in production and are indifferent to the creativity of the working masses. These ideas and styles not only greatly hinder their own progress, but also cause significant losses to the country. For example, in the design of the No. 11 Machinery Factory in Northeast China, despite discovering that the entire factory area had a layer of mobile silt underground, they still designed according to assumed calculations, so that the foundations of the buildings that had already been constructed had to be revised and strengthened, and the factory was forever trapped in an unreasonable state. Such examples exist not only in the Northeast, but also in other regions and other departments.
    Therefore, constantly educating designers, helping them to realize the importance of their responsibilities, eliminating bourgeois design ideas, conscientiously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, combining their technology with the creative labor of the working masses, and constantly summarizing the lessons of failure and the experience of success, has become an extremely important issue in improving design quality. Of course, some of the errors that occur in design work are also caused by the lack of experience of the designers, and we should patiently help them to continuously improve their technical level. It is also wrong to make general accusations without analyzing the roots and nature of the errors.

### 必须正确地进行设计工作

    必须正确地进行设计工作
    当国家的基本建设计划确定之后，除了地质工作以外，首要的问题是进行正确的设计，使每一个新建的或改建的企业都能合乎国家的要求，都能采用合理的和先进的技术标准和技术定额，都能合理地运用国家投资和地下资源。
    一个工厂或矿山，如果在设计上有错误，即使是局部的错误，那么，无论施工的质量怎样高，也无法弥补这个错误。如果设计进度迟缓，拖延了施工时间，也会影响国家工业建设的速度。因此，任何一个较大企业的设计，都必须就地质资源、交通运输、产品的品种、数量和质量，到企业的地址和布局，发展前途及与其他工业的配合等问题，从政治、经济和技术三方面作精密的考虑。否则，就会给国家招致巨大的损失。那种认为基本建设只是“盖房子、安机器”，设计不过是“照样子画图”，因而对设计工作不加重视和不加强领导的思想和做法，都是错误和有害的。
    从目前情况看来，国家基本建设中任务重、力量弱这一矛盾，在设计工作上表现得最为明显。在某些重要的工业部门中，现有的设计力量只达到一九五三年工程需要量的五分之一，某些单位还不足五分之一。这就说明了增强设计力量是迫不及待的。
    要增强设计的力量，就要积极采取长期培养和短期训练相结合的方法，有计划地大量地培养设计人材。长期培养是为了长远的利益，但这对于当前的紧急任务来说是缓不济急的。因此，我们必须合理地使用现有的设计干部，充分发挥他们的潜在力量。
    为了充分发挥现有的设计力量，必须反对某些生产单位的本位主义思想。他们强调局部需要，不服从国家的统一分配，不愿将本单位的设计人员和可以做设计工作的人员集中到基本建设部门或重要的领导部门去。这种现象是不能容忍的。为了充分发挥现有的设计力量，还必须反对某些干部中的消极等待思想。他们不积极设法增长设计力量，而只是盼望和等待上级或人事部门送来足够的设计干部，或者把希望放在还未毕业的大学生身上。还有个别的人，甚至连希望都没有了，他们说：“有多少力量就办多少事好了，何必着急呢！”这样的人在我们队伍里虽然为数不多，但如果按照他们的想法去做，我们国家就无法开始大规模的建设。这种消极等待的思想，必须加以克服和纠正。为了增强设计力量，还必须反对浪费人力的现象。如果不懂得集中地和合理地使用人力，而把有限的设计力量分散使用，这里放几个，那里放几个，每个地方都有一些，但都无法独立工作。如果在使用设计人员时不采取专业化的原则，而经常变更设计人员的设计种类，那么，每项工程的设计也都无法按时完成；即使勉强完成也是质量不高，或者是完成了小的次要的工程，放弃了大的主要的工程。因此，我们必须集中使用设计力量，特别是抓住重要的工程项目，使性质相同、条件类似的工程设计集中起来进行，逐步实行标准设计，并使设计人员专业化。
    为了完成当前的设计任务，并提高设计质量，还必须解决设计思想问题。这就是说，新建的重要厂矿的设计应当坚决采取苏联的先进技术标准，树立设计中的经济核算思想和全局观点。
    有一些单位的负责人和设计人员，不从国家的长远利益出发，不按照苏联的先进标准进行设计，而继续采取英美的落后的设计标准。他们盲目扩大安全系数；只讲外表，不求实效；不根据国家需要来计划产品品种和数量；不重视工人作业时的安全；不考虑国家资源的合理利用及与其他工业的配合；以致新建或改建的企业长期陷于产量低、质量坏、成本高的状态，经常发生事故，浪费国家的资源，造成极大的损失。这种现象，在我们的设计工作中仍然是屡见不鲜的。
    虽然我们的设计人员，经过了这几年的教育，特别是经过思想改造，绝大多数有了很大进步，在工作上一般地是负责的，对国家有一定的贡献；但是，也还有一些人（包括少数行政管理干部），由于思想的改造很不彻底，还有很严重的资产阶级思想的残余或影响。他们拒绝学习或怀疑苏联先进的设计标准，仍旧崇拜英美的设计标准；他们的草率大意和不负责任的作风还很厉害；他们忽视生产中的先进经验，对工人群众的创造表示冷淡。这些思想和作风，不但大大地妨碍了他们自己的进步，并且使国家受到重大的损失。例如在东北机械十一厂的设计中，既然发现了整个厂区地下有流动性的淤泥层，却仍然按照假定的推算进行设计，以致已经施工的建筑物的基础都得进行修正与加强，并使该厂永远陷于不合理的状态。这样的例子，不仅在东北存在，在其他地区和其他部门也是存在的。
    因此，经常地对设计人员进行教育，帮助他们认识自己责任的重大，肃清资产阶级的设计思想，认真学习苏联先进经验，使自己的技术与工人群众的创造性劳动相结合，并经常总结失败的教训和成功的经验，这就成了我们提高设计质量中的一个极重要的问题。当然，在设计工作中发生的错误，也有
    一些是设计人员缺乏经验所造成的，这就应该耐心地帮助他们不断提高技术水平。不分析错误的根源和性质而笼统地加以指责，也是不对的。
