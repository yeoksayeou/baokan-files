Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: State-owned and local state-owned industries in the North China region victoriously exceeded their 1952 production increase and savings plan of 6 trillion yuan by 24.9% at the end of December. According to incomplete statistics, the entire region completed 7,497.5 billion yuan (excluding the original Pingyuan Province areas which have not yet reported, calculated according to the original plan, other provinces and cities have exceeded the plan).

The significant achievements above were primarily due to the efforts of the broad masses of workers and the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. After democratic reforms, the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, and the "Three-Anti" movement, the class consciousness of workers in North China's factories and mines was generally enhanced. On this basis, a region-wide production competition movement was launched in a timely manner; at the same time, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed Party committees at all levels to shift the focus of their leadership to economic construction and industrial construction, and established the North China Patriotic Production Increase and Savings Competition Movement Committee. Such leadership measures played a significant role in unifying thought and action. During the competition, the three main links of revising plans, promoting advanced experiences, and determining work quotas were clearly grasped, thereby guaranteeing the completion of the production increase and savings plan and further promoting a series of production reforms.

At the start of the competition, the region's plan was increased from 4 trillion yuan to 6 trillion yuan through mass discussions and revisions to the production increase and savings plan. This played a positive role in breaking the conservative thinking of the leadership and clarifying the goals for the masses' own struggle. This was followed by three consecutive months of work to promote advanced experiences, which significantly improved production technology. For example, after the promotion of Ma Liu Hai's rapid tunneling method throughout the region, it was estimated that more than 400,000 workdays could be saved annually in the Datong and four other mining areas; the use of low-quality coal in power plants reduced costs by 20% to 40%; "front-end flour extraction" in the flour industry increased output by 40% to 100%; and the work efficiency of advanced bricklaying teams in the construction industry increased by an average of 127% throughout the region. The promotion of these decisive advanced experiences brought about a new look in factories and mines.

The widespread technical assessment work that began in October played a significant role in changing the entire production landscape and comprehensively, prominently, and deeply solving problems. In order to ensure the rapid and smooth development of the movement, sufficient preparations were made in advance, cadres were trained, typical experiments were conducted, and the concerns of the masses were dispelled. Leaders took charge and personally took action, with the Party, government, labor union, and youth league acting in unison with unified leadership, and workshop cadres providing specific leadership; in the assessment, the method of "identifying and solving problems simultaneously" was implemented, achieving great success. What is particularly worth mentioning is that: 1. The assessment work was made a mass movement, with technical personnel, assessors, and workers organized together under the leadership of the factory director to jointly assess, jointly analyze problems, and jointly solve them; the masses were mobilized to conduct their own assessments, solve their own problems, and provide clues for the leadership's assessment. Through this method, the boundary between assessment and being assessed was broken, the unity between technical personnel and workers was strengthened, knowledge of factory management was enriched, and the internal situation of the enterprise was further understood. 2. The purpose of the assessment was clarified: first, to discover and solve key problems in production in order to more effectively tap potential and improve production efficiency; and on the basis of solving problems, to formulate advanced technical norms. 3. The results of assessing advanced workers and general workers revealed and discovered advanced experiences, and further promoted these experiences in the process of solving problems. 4. Emphasis was placed on systematically solving problems, especially key problems, so it was treated as a region-wide movement universally conducted in all industries, which enabled the assessment to better concentrate its strength, achieve great success, and significantly improve production efficiency. For example, No. 1 paper machine of the Tianjin Paper Mill had failed to complete its task from March to September, but in the assessment work in October, due to the solution of key problems, it completed the entire month's task four days ahead of schedule. The fact that various localities overfulfilled their annual production increase and savings plans was inseparable from the conscientious assessment work.

Due to the implementation and strengthening of the above-mentioned work, the figures for the completion of the plan throughout the region rose month by month, such as an increase of 19% in November compared to October, and an increase of 25% in December compared to November. Therefore, the entire region not only exceeded the 6 trillion yuan production increase and savings plan, but also further promoted production reform through the promotion of advanced experiences and the conduct of assessment work, making a leap forward in all aspects of planning management, technical management, and cost and financial management, laying a good foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the economic accounting system and large-scale economic construction.

    华北区国营工业去年增产节约七万多亿元
    【新华社九日讯】华北全区国营及地方国营工业一九五二年增产节约六万亿元的计划，于十二月底超额百分之二十四点九胜利完成。据不完全统计，全区共完成七万四千九百七十五亿元（除原平原省所属地区尚未报到按原计划计算外，其他省市均已超过）。
    取得以上重大的成绩，首先是由于广大职工群众的努力和共产党与人民政府的正确领导。华北厂矿企业经过民主改革、抗美援朝、“三反”运动以后，工人的阶级觉悟普遍提高，在这一基础上，及时地展开了全区性的生产竞赛运动；同时中共中央华北局指示各级党的领导重点转向经济建设、工业建设，成立了华北爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会。领导上采取这样的措施，对于统一思想、统一行动起了重大的作用。在竞赛运动中，明确抓住了修订计划、推广先进经验、查定工作这三个主要环节，从而保证完成了增产节约计划，进一步推动了一系列的生产改革工作。
    竞赛运动开始，通过群众讨论修订增产节约计划，使全区计划由四万亿元增加到六万亿元，这对于打破领导上的保守思想，明确群众自己的奋斗目标都起了良好的作用。接着是连续三个月推广先进经验的工作，使生产技术普遍地有了显著的提高。如马六孩快速掘进在全区推广后，据大同等五个矿区计算，全年即可节省四十余万个工；发电厂烧低质煤，使成本降低百分之二十至四十；面粉业的“前路出粉”，提高产量百分之四十至一百；建筑业先进砌砖小组的工作效率，全区平均提高百分之一百二十七。这些有决定意义的先进经验的推广，使厂矿面貌为之一新。
    从十月份开始了普遍的技术查定工作，对于改变整个生产面貌，全面、突出、深入地解决问题起了很大作用。为了使运动迅速顺利地开展，事先做了充分的准备工作，训练了干部，作了典型试验，解除了群众的顾虑。由首长负责、亲自动手，党政工团统一步调、统一领导，车间负责干部具体领导；在查定中，贯彻了“边查边解决问题”的方法，获得了很大的成绩。特别值得提出的是：一、把查定工作成为群众性的运动，在厂长领导下，技术人员、查定员同工人群众组织在一起，共同查，共同分析问题与解决问题；并发动群众自己查，自己解决问题和提供领导上查的线索。通过这种方法，打破了查与被查的界限，加强了技术人员与工人的团结，丰富了管理工厂的知识，进一步了解了企业的内在情况。二、明确了查定的目的，首先是为了发现并解决生产中的关键问题，以便于更有力的挖掘潜力，提高生产效率；在解决问题的基础上，制订出先进的技术定额。三、查先进工作者与一般工人的结果，检查与发现了先进经验，并在解决问题中，进一步推广了经验。四、强调系统地解决问题特别是关键性的问题，所以把它当做一个全区性的、各行各业普遍进行的运动，这就使查定的力量更好地集中起来，收到了很大的成绩，使生产效率突出地提高起来。如天津造纸总厂一号造纸机，三至九月份一直没有完成任务，在十月份进行查定工作中由于解决了关键性的问题，即提前四天完成了全月任务。各地超额完成全年增产节约计划，都和认真地进行查定工作是分不开的。
    由于以上各项工作的推行和加强，使全区完成计划的数字逐月上升，如十一月比十月提高百分之十九，十二月比十一月提高百分之二十五。因之，全区不仅超额完成了六万亿元的增产节约计划，而且由于推广先进经验和进行查定工作，进一步推动了生产改革，使计划管理、技术管理、成本财务管理各方面都跃进了一步，为全面实行经济核算制与大规模的经济建设打下了良好的基础。
