Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 25th: Since the victorious conclusion of the Battle of Shangganling, the enemy on the "Little Red Hill" position, covering an area of only 1,700 square meters, has been subjected to five consecutive attacks by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, resulting in the total annihilation of two reinforced platoons and three squads.

    In early January, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units in the Shangganling area braved wind and snow to launch two surprise attacks and one assault on the enemy defending "Little Red Hill" to the left of Height 597.9 in Shangganling, north of Jinhua.

    On the evening of the 5th, two squads of soldiers from a certain company of our army, under the slogan of "Realizing the New Year's Plan to Kill the Enemy and Achieve Meritorious Service," launched a strong attack on the enemy on "Little Red Hill." The temperature at the time was minus twenty degrees Celsius. The artillerymen excitedly removed the cold-weather covers from their cannons and began a fierce bombardment of the enemy's position. The enemy's artillery only returned fire with five shells before being silenced by our army's powerful artillery fire.

    As our artillery fire extended deep into the enemy's position, the infantrymen leapt out of the tunnels and rushed towards the enemy's position, destroying the enemy's remaining bunkers and blasting the resisting enemies to death inside. Soldier Wang Yuben continuously destroyed eight bunkers, then aimed his submachine gun at the bunker entrances, riddling the enemies inside. When one enemy tried to escape, our combat team leader Zhang Fengchun captured him alive. In less than six minutes of combat, the brave men of our two squads annihilated 55 enemies, capturing one American-style light machine gun and four automatic rifles. After the battle, both squads were commended by the command.

    Before and after this assault—on January 2nd and 9th—our army launched two night attacks on "Little Red Hill," annihilating a total of three enemy squads without suffering any casualties.

    Before carrying out these attacks, our army made full preparations. The commanders repeatedly observed the terrain, selected the best routes of attack, and studied methods of fighting the enemy together with the soldiers. Therefore, whenever the brave men rushed into the enemy's position, the enemies shivering with cold in their bunkers were immediately annihilated.

    According to a captured Rhee (South Korean) soldier, the enemies on "Little Red Hill" were afraid to show their heads during the day due to our army's snipers, and dared not sleep at night for fear of our army's attacks, sometimes even going without food or water. Therefore, they called this position "the position of death."

    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 25th: The transporters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are braving the severe cold and wind and snow to continuously transport large quantities of grain, ammunition, and other supplies from the rear to the front lines.

    One morning after a heavy snowfall, the temperature dropped to minus thirty-seven degrees Celsius. A certain transportation company of our army on the Yuyin Mountain front received the task of transporting rice to the front-line positions. The transporters immediately shouldered their rice sacks and set off for Yuyin Mountain, which is more than 1,000 meters above sea level.

    The heavy snow covered the roads, and each step sank past the knees. But the transporters were not afraid of difficulties. They moved forward step by step and climbed over one icy mountain ridge after another. When climbing steep slopes, even their anti-slip "foot-horses" (crampons) lost their effectiveness, and they would slide down several steps for every step they took. At this time, everyone shouted: "Conquer the ice and snow, climb up!" "Create a steel transportation company!" They grabbed onto branches and rocks to continue climbing. Their hands were numb with cold, and their eyebrows and mustaches were covered with ice, while the sweat on their bodies soaked through their clothes. When they reached the top of the mountain, the north wind froze their sweat-soaked clothes stiff.

    Soldier Zeng Yi's "foot-horse" got caught on a piece of wood. When he pulled his leg, he fell with his load, sliding more than ten meters. His nose was bruised, and he bled profusely. Everyone urged him to go back and rest, but he said, "What's the point of going back? I must deliver the supplies to the front!" He stuffed his nose with cotton and continued to advance with the ammunition on his back.

    The diligent transportation of the transporters ensures that our front-line positions are always well-stocked with grain and ammunition, and that the soldiers receive many daily necessities and cultural and entertainment equipment.

    上甘岭我军歼“小红山”守敌两个排三个班
    志愿军运输员冒大雪严寒源源不断把物资送到前沿阵地
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】自从上甘岭战役胜利结束以来，在面积不过一千七百平方公尺的“小红山”阵地上的敌人，已连续遭到中国人民志愿军五次打击，共被全部歼灭两个加强排和三个班。
    一月上旬，上甘岭地区的中国人民志愿军部队冒着风雪，向金化以北上甘岭的五九七点九高地左边“小红山”上守敌进行了两次袭击和一次强攻。
    五日晚上，我军某连两个班的战士们在“实现新年杀敌立功计划”的口号下，向“小红山”上的敌人发起强攻。当时气温在零下二十度，炮兵们兴奋地解下了大炮上的防寒炮衣，就向敌人阵地开始猛烈的轰击。敌人的炮群只还击了五发炮弹，就被我军强大的炮火打哑了。
    当我军炮火向敌人阵地纵深进行延伸射击时，步兵战士们便跃出坑道扑向敌人阵地，炸毁了敌人残存的地堡群，把企图抵抗的敌人都炸死在地堡里。战士王玉本连续炸毁了八个地堡以后，端着冲锋枪对准地堡口扫射，打得里面的敌人哇哇叫。有一个敌人想逃跑，我军战斗组长张凤春把他活捉了。在不到六分钟的战斗中，我军两个班的勇士们歼灭敌人五十五名，缴获美式轻机枪一挺，自动步枪四枝。战后，这两个班都受到了指挥机关的表扬。
    在这次强攻前后——一月二日和九日，我军曾两次夜袭“小红山”，共歼灭敌人三个班，而自己没有一人伤亡。
    在进行这些攻击以前，我军都做了充分的准备，指挥员反复观察了地形，选择好攻击道路，并和战士们共同研究打敌人的方法。所以，每当勇士们冲进敌军阵地时，在地堡里冻得发抖的敌人便被一下子歼灭掉。
    据一个被俘的李伪军士兵说，在“小红山”上的敌人，白天被我军狙击手打得不敢露头，晚上因为恐惧我军的袭击而不敢睡觉，有时甚至吃不上饭，喝不上水，所以他们把这块阵地叫做“送死的阵地”。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】中国人民志愿军的运输员们冒着严寒和风雪，源源不断地把大批粮食、弹药和其他物资从后方运到前沿阵地。
    　在大雪后的一个早晨，气温降到零下三十七度。我军鱼隐山前线某运输连接受了运送大米到前沿阵地去的任务。运输员们立即背起米袋向拔海一千多公尺高的鱼隐山进发。
    大雪掩盖了道路，一脚踩下去就没过膝盖。但是运输员们不怕艰难，他们步步前进，并且翻过了一座座冰山雪岭。他们在爬陡坡的时候，防滑的“脚马”也失掉了作用，甚至走一步要滑下来好几步。这时大家喊道：“战胜冰雪，爬上去呀！”“创造钢铁运输连呀！”他们抓住树枝和石头继续往上爬进。他们的手冻麻木了，眉毛、胡髭上都结了冰花，而身上的汗水却湿透了衣裳。当他们爬到山顶以后，北风又把他们汗湿的衣服吹得冻成硬梆梆的了。
    战士曾义宽的“脚马”绊在一块木头上，他一拔腿，连人带东西都摔倒了，一下子滑出去三丈多远。他的鼻子碰青了，鼻血流个不止。大家劝他回去休息，他说：“回去干什么，一定要把物资送到前沿！”他用棉花把鼻子一塞，又背起弹药继续前进了。
    运输员们辛勤地运输的结果，使我军前沿阵地上经常保持着粮满仓、弹满库，并且使战士们得到了许多日用品和文化娱乐器具。
