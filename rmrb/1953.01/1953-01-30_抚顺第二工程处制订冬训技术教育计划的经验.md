    Fushun Second Construction Engineering Office's Experience in Formulating a Winter Training Technical Education Plan
    Xiao Ding
    Whether the winter training technical education plan is appropriate directly affects whether the 1953 capital construction plan can be successfully completed. After extensively soliciting opinions from employees and repeated discussions, we formulated a winter training technical education plan. Our experience is:
    First, the plan must be closely integrated with actual needs. This is a principle we adhere to when dividing classes and determining teaching material content. We divided the trainees into eight classes: bricklayers, carpenters, concrete workers, painters, electricians, steel bar workers, plumbers, and scaffolders; we grouped together trades with similar natures and close connections between them into one class, such as bricklaying, plastering, pointing, and tile hanging. These trades are similar in nature. At the same time, bricklaying is mostly done in the second and third quarters, while pointing and plastering are mostly done in the third and fourth quarters. Combining these four trades into one class allows them to learn operations of a similar nature. This can reduce the phenomenon of idleness caused by seasonal restrictions on the one hand, and increase a portion of construction technical strength on the other. For example, for trades with similar natures such as steel bar work, plumbing, and sheet metal work, we also combined them into one class for the same reason.
    In terms of teaching material content, we plan to divide it into seven units: blueprint reading and layout, operating procedures and quality standards, advanced experience, instruction charts, technical safety, labor organization and wage policies, and special reports. Units one and six were determined based on workers' opinions. Because in general, workers find it difficult to understand blueprints during construction operations, they are not sure if what they are doing is right or wrong, they are not familiar with layout and material preparation, and they do not understand the conversion between metric and customary systems. Therefore, we made blueprint reading and layout a teaching unit in order to further improve the level of technical workers. In addition, in terms of labor organization and wage policies, because workers generally do not understand the principles of organization, division of labor, wages, and wage calculation, unreasonable labor organization and wage disputes are very common. Therefore, we also made this part a unit, with the aim of correcting some deviations in wage work and stabilizing the learning mood through teaching. This unit is planned to begin after the political education is completed.
    Second, the plan should be combined with the direction of development. This is an important task of this year's winter training technical education, because in the future, reinforced concrete factory buildings will be more common than brick and wood structures in terms of architectural design, and in terms of construction technology, it is developing towards factoryization and mechanization. Therefore, we particularly emphasize that in each unit of technical education, we must especially strengthen teaching in this area. For example, in the four major trades of tile laying, carpentry, steel bars, and concrete, we must increase the learning time of engineering instruction charts, parallel flow operations, and group work instruction charts. In addition to learning general group instruction charts, we especially emphasize learning handover inspections to ensure quality and contract links to ensure the completion of tasks according to instruction charts, to meet the requirements of fully promoting the advanced experience of engineering instruction charts in 1953. In the advanced experience unit for the reinforced concrete trade, we particularly emphasize learning prefabrication and installation to meet the requirements of increasing mechanized operation this year. For example, in carpentry, in addition to discussing general flow operation methods, we focus on the advanced experience of factoryization in order to transform carpentry groups into carpentry workshops this year, each process into a process group, and then develop to factoryization.
    Third, an education method based on discussion and practice, supplemented by lectures should be adopted. Generally, lecture time accounts for 20 percent of the total learning time, and at most does not exceed 50 percent; while the main learning methods are discussion, demonstration, and practice. Through learning, discussion, and practice, each trade must develop a more complete set of operating procedures. For example, the conclusions from learning and demonstration by the tile and carpentry trades will serve as the blueprint for future revisions of operating procedures; the electrical and plumbing aspects will develop a set of operating procedures based on learning conclusions; and the advanced experience aspect will determine the direction of promoting advanced experience in 1953 through learning, demonstration, practical discussion.

    抚顺第二工程处制订冬训技术教育计划的经验
    晓丁
    冬训技术教育计划拟订得是否合适，直接影响一九五三年基本建设计划能否顺利完成。我们经过广泛征求职工意见和反复讨论，拟订了冬训技术教育计划。我们的体验是：
    第一、计划与实际需要必须密切结合。这是我们在分别班次和确定教材内容时掌握的一个原则。我们把受训职工分为瓦工、木工、混凝土、油漆、电气、铁筋、水暖、架工等八班；把工种性质相近和工种之间联系较密切的归并在一个班次，如砌砖、抹灰、抅缝、挂瓦四个工种编在一起。这几个工种性质接近，同时，砌砖多在第二、第三季度，而抅缝、抹灰多在第三、第四季度，把这四个工种合并为一个班次，彼此可以学习性质相似的操作。这样一方面可以减少因季节限制而窝工的现象，另一方面可以增加一部分施工技术力量。又如铁筋、水暖、白铁等性质相近的工种，我们同样把它们合并为一个班次，也是这个原因。
    在教材内容方面，我们计划分成看图放样、操作规程和质量标准、先进经验、指示图表、技术保安、劳动组织和工资政策、专题报告七个单元。其中一、六两项是根据工人的意见确定的。因为一般工人在施工操作时感到困难的是不懂图纸，做得对或错心里没底，对放样下料不熟，公制、市用制的换算都弄不清楚，因此，我们把看图放样作为一个单元教学，以便进一步提高技术工人的水平。另外，在劳动组织和工资政策方面，由于一般工人不了解组织分工、工资以及工资计算等原则，劳动组织不合理、闹工资的情况很普遍。所以，我们把这一部分也作为一个单元，目的是通过教学，纠正工资工作中的一些偏差，稳定学习情绪。这一单元准备在政治教育结束后就开始。
    第二、计划要与发展方向相结合。这是今年冬训技术教育的重要任务，因为今后在建筑造型上是钢筋混凝土厂房建筑多于砖木结构的建筑，在施工技术上，是向着工厂化、机械化的方向发展。因此，我们特别强调在每一单元的技术教育中，都要特别加强这一方面的教学。例如在瓦、木、钢筋、混凝土四个主要工种中，要增加工程指示图平行流水作业、小组工作指示图等的学习时间，除了学习一般的小组指示图以外，特别强调学习保证质量的交接检查和保证按指示图表完成任务的联系合同，以适应一九五三年全部推广工程指示图先进经验的要求。钢筋混凝土工种在学习先进经验的单元里，则特别强调学习预制安装，以适应今年增加机械化操作的要求。又如在木工中除讲一般的流水作业法以外，着重讲工厂化的先进经验，以求得今年木工小组变成木工车间，每个工序变成工序小组，进而发展到工厂化。
    第三、应采用讨论实习为主、讲课为辅的教育方式。一般讲课时间占全部学习时间的百分之二十，最多不超过百分之五十；而主要的学习方式是讨论、表演、实习。通过学习讨论、实习，各工种都要订出一套比较完整的操作规程。如瓦木工种把学习、表演得出的结论，作为今后修正操作规程的蓝本；电气、水暖方面要根据学习结论制订出一套操作规程；先进经验方面则通过学习、表演、实习讨论，决定一九五三年推广先进经验的方向。
