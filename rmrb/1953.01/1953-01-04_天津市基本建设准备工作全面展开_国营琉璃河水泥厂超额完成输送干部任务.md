Tianjin Launches Full-Scale Preparations for Basic Construction; State-Run Liulihe Cement Plant Exceeds Quota for Transferring Cadres

In order to meet the needs of large-scale basic construction, relevant departments in Tianjin are actively carrying out a series of preparatory work.

The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has established a Basic Construction Department to strengthen leadership over basic construction work. The Construction Engineering Bureau, the Municipal Engineering Bureau, and other units are preparing to establish two design companies and eight engineering companies according to the needs of basic construction in 1953, striving for specialization in design and construction. To enhance basic construction strength, a large number of outstanding cadres and technical personnel are now being transferred from various agencies and enterprises to basic construction departments; some departments are using technical personnel irrationally, and registration and transfer work has begun.

Since October last year, construction departments and municipal construction departments have been systematically carrying out the work of fixing long-term construction workers. In two months, nearly 20,000 construction workers have been fixed. Under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Basic Construction Workers Winter Training Committee was established at the end of November. After nearly a month of active preparation, most of the winter training classes started on schedule on December 25, with 10,000 fixed construction workers participating in the study; it is estimated that more than 10,000 people will also participate in the study in the coming days. In order to better learn advanced experience, the Construction Engineering Bureau and other units have selected 50 workers to participate in the advanced experience training class for the construction industry jointly organized by the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. It has also been decided to open four types of business cadre training classes in January this year, with 1,500 people participating in the study.

In order to complete the basic construction tasks in 1953 in an organized and planned manner, the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee is reviewing and arranging the design and construction sequence according to the priority of basic construction tasks, so as to carry out the design in advance. In order to summarize past experience, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed relevant departments to conduct a major inspection of basic construction throughout the city. All basic construction departments should, through this inspection, summarize experiences and lessons, educate cadres, improve their ideological and technical levels, and improve future design and construction work. At the same time, the Municipal People's Government will also organize inspection teams to conduct key inspections. The design company under the Construction Engineering Bureau began inspection on December 22. The designers will go to the construction site to inspect the projects they designed, and solicit opinions from the owners and construction departments, so as to absorb experience and lessons, improve design technology, and further establish correct design ideas. The inspection and summary work of the 1952 projects of various construction departments will also begin one after another.

Furthermore, after the Ministry of Heavy Industry held a meeting of factory directors and mine managers, the Liulihe Cement Plant conscientiously implemented the principle of "putting basic construction in the primary position," and immediately held a meeting of party and administrative responsible cadres to convey and discuss Minister Wang Heshou's report. After reaching a consensus on the ideological understanding of the responsible cadres, various meetings were held to publicize and explain to the masses. With emphasis, serious and repeated discussions were held among cadres at the section chief level on how to transfer cadres, especially regarding the conservative, localist, and disregard for the overall situation erroneous thoughts that had occurred in the past allocation of cadres, giving them forceful criticism. The tendency of not paying attention to basic construction and vague understanding was also universally examined among the masses, so that all employees understood that basic construction is the main key to the country's economic construction and the fundamental problem of the country's industrialization, correcting the past view that basic construction was just building houses. As a result, the idea that "it is glorious to go to basic construction jobs" was established among the employees, and most comrades expressed their willingness to unconditionally obey the organization's transfer.

At present, according to the instructions of the higher authorities to "transfer heads but not tails" and "transfer the strong but not the weak," the plant has transferred more than 80% of the section chief-level cadres, more than 50% of the engineering and technical personnel, 81 other cadres, and 36 technical workers to basic construction jobs, not only exceeding the transfer task indicated by the bureau in terms of quantity, but also ensuring the quality of the cadres.

In order not to affect production work, the plant has adopted the method of "taking materials locally" on the existing basis, and promoted a large number of new cadres. Three section chief-level cadres have been promoted, seven professional cadres have been promoted from workers, and it is planned to promote another eleven responsible cadres (already sent to the bureau for approval).

Due to the leadership's bold and unreserved promotion of a group of new cadres, not only has the shortage of cadres been supplemented, but also a new atmosphere has emerged in production. For example, Li Jingzhang (worker), the newly promoted deputy director of the sintering workshop of the plant, led workers and united technical personnel to promote the rapid kiln firing method, which increased the hourly output by 9.5% compared to before.

### 天津市基本建设准备工作全面展开  国营琉璃河水泥厂超额完成输送干部任务

    天津市基本建设准备工作全面展开
    国营琉璃河水泥厂超额完成输送干部任务
    为了迎接大规模基本建设任务，天津市各有关部门正积极地进行着一系列的准备工作。
    天津市财政经济委员会为加强对基本建设工作的领导，已成立基本建设处。建筑工程局、市政工程局等单位根据一九五三年基本建设的需要，准备建立两个设计公司、八个工程公司，力求设计及施工专业化。为增强基本建设力量，现已开始由各机关、企业中抽调大批优秀干部、技术人员，输送到基本建设部门去；有些部门使用技术人员不合理，已开始进行登记及抽调工作。
    各建筑部门和市政建设部门由去年十月份开始有计划地进行固定长期建筑工人的工作，两个月已固定建筑工人近两万名。在中共天津市委统一领导下，市基本建设工人冬季训练委员会已于十一月月底成立，经近一个月来的积极筹备，十二月二十五日大部冬训班已按期开学，参加学习的固定建筑工人达一万人；预计还有一万余人日内也将参加学习。为了更好地学习先进经验，建筑工程局等单位已选派工人五十人参加了中央人民政府建筑工程部和中华全国总工会联合举办的建筑业先进经验训练班。并决定在今年一月开办四种性质的业务干部训练班，将有一千五百人参加学习。
    为了有组织有计划地完成一九五三年基本建设任务，天津市财政经济委员会正分别基本建设任务的轻重缓急，审查与排列设计施工顺序，以便提前进行设计。中共天津市委为了总结过去的经验，特指示有关部门在全市范围内进行一次基本建设大检查，各基本建设部门均要通过此次检查，总结经验教训，教育干部，提高干部的思想水平和技术水平，改进今后的设计、施工工作。同时，市人民政府并将组织检查组，进行重点检查。建筑工程局所属设计公司，已于十二月二十二日开始检查，设计人员将亲赴工地检查自己设计的工程，并征求业主和施工部门的意见，以便吸取经验教训，提高设计技术，并进一步树立正确的设计思想。各施工部门对一九五二年工程的检查总结工作，也将陆续开始。
    又讯：自重工业部召开厂矿长会议后，琉璃河水泥厂认真执行“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，立即举行了党、行政负责干部会议，传达与讨论了王鹤寿部长的报告。在负责干部思想认识上取得一致后，又召开了各种会议向群众宣传解释。并有重点地在科长级干部中结合如何输送干部问题从思想上作了认真的反复的讨论，特别是对于以往调配干部时所发生的保守、本位、不顾全局等错误思想给以有力的批判。在群众中也普遍的检查了对基本建设不重视和认识模糊的倾向，使全体职工明确了基本建设是关系国家经济建设的主要关键，是国家工业化的根本问题，纠正了过去认为基本建设只是盖房子的看法。因而在职工中树立了“到基本建设工作岗位是光荣的”思想，大部分同志表示愿意无条件服从组织的调动。
    现该厂已根据上级“调头不调尾”、“调强不调弱”的指示，抽调了百分之八十以上的科长级干部、百分之五十以上的工程技术人员，八十一名其他干部和三十六名技术工人输送到基本建设工作岗位，不仅在数量上超过了局指示的抽调任务，同时还保证了干部的质量。
    为了不使生产工作受到影响，该厂又在现有基础上采取“就地取材”的方法，大量的提拔了一批新干部。现已提拔了科长级干部三名、从工人中提拔了专业干部七名，另外还计划再提拔负责干部十一名（已送局审批）。
    由于领导上大胆、放手的提拔了一批新干部，不仅补充了干部的缺额，而且在生产上出现了新气象。例如该厂烧成车间新提拔的副主任李敬章（工人）领导工人、团结技术人员，推行了快速烧窑法，使每小时产量较前提高了百分之九点五。
