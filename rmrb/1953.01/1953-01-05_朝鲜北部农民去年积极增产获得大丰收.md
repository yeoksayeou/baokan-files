Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th – North Korean farmers in the northern regions achieved a bumper harvest in 1952. Many veteran farmers say that the autumn harvest last year was the best in decades. A large number of high-yield farmers emerged in the mass movement for increased production in various places, creating new high-yield records. The highest rice yield per unit area reached 39,600 jin per chō (approximately 1.487 acres), and the highest millet yield reached 18,000 jin per chō.

The agricultural productivity of northern Korea suffered severe damage due to the burning, killing, looting, and subsequent indiscriminate bombing by the American aggressors during their occupation. There was a severe lack of labor, draught animals, farm implements, fertilizer, and seeds. The massive flood in 1951 added even more difficulties. However, the farmers responded to General Kim Il-sung's call in February last year: "Produce more grain, don't leave any land uncultivated, and guarantee to supply more grain and raw materials to the front and rear." They organized various forms of mutual aid groups, displayed high patriotic enthusiasm, and launched challenge competitions between individuals, households, mutual aid groups, and villages. Lacking fertilizer, they carried out large-scale grass cutting, composting, and soil improvement work. When dams were destroyed by enemy aircraft, they braved the severe cold and went into the water to repair them. During the busy farming season last year, enemy aircraft bombed power plants, and many irrigation pumps could not operate. The farmers organized water-drawing teams and well-digging teams, carrying water day and night with buckets, even using ladles to scoop water to irrigate the fields. Ignoring the enemy aircraft's planned harassment during the busy farming season, they camouflaged both people and cattle to continue cultivation. Some transported manure at night and weeded in the moonlight, and in many places, they weeded four times. Some fields were riddled with bomb craters by enemy aircraft, but they repaired them immediately and continued to cultivate.

In the increased production competition, the farmers, following the instructions of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, broke with conservative views, studied and adopted various advanced experiences and methods, such as selecting seeds using scientific methods, cultivating seedlings using the "dry seedbed" method (using dry land as a seedbed), transplanting seedlings according to the "sparse planting method" and the "bird's foot transplanting" method, using the "direct dry seeding method" (sowing on dry land without going through the transplanting stage) in areas with insufficient water, and fertilizing according to the "three-layer fertilization method." This was an important reason for their bumper harvest. For example, farmer Li Changjing from Jiachuan County, Pingan South Province, planted one chō (3,000 pyong) of rice this year. He transplanted seedlings using the sparse planting method in 300 pyong of paddy fields, harvesting 2,800 jin; the remaining paddy fields yielded only 1,600 jin per 300 pyong.

The farmers received assistance from all sides. Thanks to the concern of the Korean government and the help of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, the farmers' difficulties in lacking grain, seeds, and draught animals were resolved. Labor assistance teams organized by urban workers, staff, and students, especially the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, helped the farmers overcome labor shortages.

The Korean farmers overcame numerous difficulties and achieved a brilliant victory. In various places, a large number of farmers achieved yields of 15,000 to 16,000 jin of rice per chō of paddy field. In Pingan North Province, 209 farmers created a record of harvesting more than 36,000 jin of rice per chō, among them, farmer Jin Daesik from Dingzhou County even reached 39,600 jin per chō, which was the highest rice yield in the Republic in 1952. Farmer Yu Run from Bukcheong County, Hamgyong South Province, harvested 18,000 jin of millet per chō, which was the highest millet yield in the Republic in 1952.

While busily and happily carrying out the autumn harvest, farmers in various places selected good grain and hurried to weave straw bags and straw ropes for storing grain, preparing for the payment of in-kind taxes, and then launched a competition for early grain delivery. By early December, farmers in various provinces had almost entirely completed the payment of in-kind taxes. The farmers also actively donated rice to support the front line, fully demonstrating the patriotic enthusiasm of the Korean farmers.

After the end of the autumn harvest, the farmers immediately turned to autumn plowing. They also formulated increased production plans for 1953, held various meetings, learned and summarized advanced farming experiences, and welcomed the new victorious year.

    朝鲜北部农民去年积极增产获得大丰收
    【新华社平壤四日电】朝鲜北部农民在一九五二年获得大丰收。许多老农民说，去年的秋收是几十年以来未曾有过的丰收。各地在群众性的增产竞赛运动中涌现了大批丰产农民，创造了丰产新纪录。最高的水稻单位面积产量达一町步（合一四点八七市亩）收获三万九千六百市斤，最高的小米产量达一町步收获一万八千市斤。
    朝鲜北部的农业生产力，由于美国侵略者侵占时期的烧杀抢掠和其后的狂轰滥炸，遭受了严重破坏。劳动力、耕畜、农具、肥料、种籽等都十分缺乏。一九五一年的大水灾又增加了更多的困难。但是，农民们响应了金日成将军在去年二月发出的号召：“丰产粮食，不荒一块地，保证供给前后方更多的粮食和原料”。他们组织起各种形式的互助组织，发挥了高度的爱国热情，展开了个人与个人、户与户、互助组与互助组、村与村之间的挑战竞赛。缺乏肥料，他们就进行大规模的割草、堆肥和改良土壤的工作。水坝被敌机炸毁了，他们不顾严寒，下水修坝。去年农忙期间，敌机轰炸了发电厂，许多灌溉用的抽水机不能转动了，农民们就组织戽水班和打井班，日夜用水桶挑水，甚至用水瓢戽水灌田。他们不顾敌机在农忙时期有计划的骚扰，把人和耕牛都伪装起来坚持耕作，有的在夜间送粪，在月夜锄草，不少地方都锄草四次。有些田地被敌机炸了许多弹坑，他们随即修好继续耕种。
    在增产竞赛中，农民们按照朝鲜劳动党和政府的指示，打破保守观点，研究和采用了各种先进经验和方法，如用科学方法选种、用“陆床苗”（以干地为苗床）方法培苗，按“少株密植法”和“鸟足式移秧”的方法插秧，在水量不足的地带使用“干直播栽培法”（在干地上播种，不经过移秧阶段），以及按照“三层施肥法”施肥等。这是他们取得丰收的重要原因。例如，平安南道价川郡农民李昌敬今年种了一町步（合三千坪）稻子，他在三百坪水田里以少株密植的方法移秧，收获二千八百市斤；其余的稻田，每三百坪只收获一千六百市斤。
    农民们得到了各方面的帮助。由于朝鲜政府的关心以及苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民的帮助，农民们缺乏粮食、种籽和耕畜的困难才得以解决。城市工人、职员、学生组织的劳动协助队，特别是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的协助帮助农民们克服了劳动力的困难。
    朝鲜农民克服了重重困难，取得了辉煌的胜利。各地大批农民一町步稻田的产量都达到了一万五、六千市斤。平安北道有二百零九个农民创造了一町步收获稻子三万六千市斤以上的纪录，其中，定州郡农民金大植一町步的产量甚至达到了三万九千六百市斤，是共和国一九五二年稻子的最高产量。咸镜南道北青郡农民鱼润一町步的小米收获一万八千市斤，是共和国一九五二年小米的最高产量。
    各地农民们早在紧张、愉快地进行秋收的同时，就选出好粮食，并赶着编制装粮食的草袋与草绳，作了缴纳现物税的准备，接着就展开了提前缴粮的竞赛。到十二月上旬，各道农民已将近全部交完了现物税。农民们并纷纷捐献支援前线米，这充分表现出朝鲜农民的爱国热情。
    农民们在秋收结束后，立即转入秋耕。他们并订出了一九五三年的增产计划，举行各种集会，学习和总结先进的农作经验，迎接新的胜利的一年。
