    Victories of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Autumn-Winter Offensive

    In the past year, the Vietnamese liberation war has seen even greater development. Following the liberation of Hoa Binh and the victory in the counter-"sweeping" campaigns, the Vietnamese People's Army launched the Autumn-Winter Offensive, winning significant victories in various battles in the Northwest. During this offensive, the People's Army advanced from the Red River to the Black River and Ma River, successively capturing key towns and strongholds such as Nghia Lo, Quynh Nhai, Van Yen, Moc Chau, Son La, Dien Bien Phu, and Ma River, besieging Na San and Lai Chau City, eliminating more than 14,000 French invading troops, and liberating over 80 percent of the land and three-quarters of the people in the Northwest. Prior to this, the French invaders had boasted, "We have seized the initiative, and the Viet Minh army is absolutely incapable of attacking our Northwest base." The iron fist of the Vietnamese People's Army completely shattered this shameless lie.

    The victories of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Northwest of North Vietnam have brought about new changes in the situation of the Vietnam War. Currently, on the 270-kilometer front from south of Lai Chau to Moc Chau along the Black River, the French army has only one isolated stronghold left, Na San; the entire former French Ma River military sub-district, from Dien Bien Phu to the Ma River, has been completely liberated; the People's Army also controls the two highways leading from Dien Bien Phu and Moc Chau to Laos. Therefore, the People's Army has not only expanded and consolidated the North Vietnamese liberated area but can also connect with the liberated areas and guerrilla zones in Central Vietnam to the south, strengthening the threat to enemy forces in the Red River Delta; to the west, it can connect with the Laotian liberated area, increasing the difficulties for the French invaders on the Laotian battlefield.

    On the Vietnamese and even the entire Indochinese battlefield, the French invading forces are increasingly falling into a passive and vulnerable position.

    The victory of the Autumn-Winter Offensive demonstrates that the Vietnamese People's Army is becoming stronger. They can not only defeat the enemy in guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare but also have greatly strengthened their ability to attack fortified positions. Nghia Lo, Don Giao, Moc Chau, and Son La were all important strongholds of the French army, but the People's Army was able to quickly remove them; in the attack on An Chau, they advanced 30 kilometers in 24 hours, demonstrating strong combat capabilities. The People's Army, whose equipment has been enhanced through combat, has mastered more heavy weapons, causing the French army to exclaim that "the Viet Minh army's firepower is fierce." At the same time, the People's Army's continuous combat capability has also been significantly improved. Since the liberation of Nghia Lo, the People's Army has maintained the offensive for nearly three months, giving the French army no chance to catch its breath. In various battles, the People's Army fully demonstrated its flexibility and mobility. After suffering a disastrous defeat in the Nghia Lo area, the French army ventured to invade the Phu Tho area, attempting to salvage its precarious situation in the Northwest; at this time, while the People's Army heroically resisted in Duan Hung, it seized the weakness of the enemy's rear being empty and took the initiative to attack in the areas of Phat Diem, Hung Yen, and Nam Dinh south of Hanoi, shaking the enemy's heartland, forcing the French army to retreat in disarray from the Phu Tho area, thereby ensuring the victorious crossing of the Black River by the People's Army in the Northwest. When the French forces besieged in Na San relied on air reinforcements to struggle desperately, the People's Army tightened the encirclement on one hand and suddenly advanced to the Laotian border, capturing the French strongholds of Muong Khoua, Muong Sai, and Na Le, and liberating the entire Ma River area.

    During the Autumn-Winter Offensive, the Vietnamese People's Army also achieved important political victories. In order to realize their conspiracy of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," the French invaders forcibly conscripted young men in the occupied areas to serve as cannon fodder for the invasion, imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, sucking the people's marrow, and established so-called autonomous regions (such as the "Thai Autonomous Region" in the Northwest), attempting to divide the unity of the various ethnic groups of Vietnam. However, this shameless conspiracy has repeatedly failed. Due to the continuous victories of the Vietnamese People's Army and the influence of the correct implementation of the policy of lenient treatment of prisoners, the phenomenon of puppet troops surrendering to the People's Army in platoons and companies has become increasingly common. In the battles in the Northwest, the puppet troops fired into the air, and large numbers surrendered their weapons as soon as they were surrounded, with 80 percent becoming prisoners of war. The situation of French soldiers of European and African origin is also the same, and anti-war movements such as desertion, mutiny, and surrender are growing. At the same time, due to the resolute implementation of President Ho Chi Minh's policy of uniting the people of the whole country by the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Democratic Government, and the People's Army, in the enemy-occupied areas, the Vietnamese people, in addition to actively participating in the guerrillas, also dug secret tunnels to resist the French invaders and the puppet government's frantic conscription. They broke through the French army's blockade, used materials to support the People's Army and the guerrillas, and fought alongside the people in the liberated areas for national liberation. Before liberation, the Thai people secretly cared for the wounded and sick personnel of the People's Army; after liberation, they returned home to produce one after another, living a free life under the democratic regime, and actively launched work to support the front lines.

    On the other hand, the losses of the French invaders in the war of aggression against Vietnam are becoming increasingly large. The French army suffered 80,000 casualties throughout 1952, almost equal to one-half of the total casualties of 170,000 in the past five years. According to official French announcements, the French military expenditure in Vietnam in 1951 cost more than 283 billion francs, and by 1952, it had increased to 569 billion francs. This is obviously a deliberately reduced figure, and in reality, it is much larger than this figure. This is the price the French invaders are paying for conducting the "dirty war."

    The great victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Autumn-Winter Offensive has caused panic among the French ruling clique. French Defense Minister Pleven exclaimed, "The burden of Indochina is too heavy, and France cannot afford it alone!" In addition to increasing the military budget for the invasion of Vietnam in 1953 to 589 billion francs, the French government is also preparing to expand the Bao Dai puppet army from 120,000 to 160,000 to make up for the difficulty in finding French soldiers. At the same time, the French government is begging the United States for more "aid," and even sounding the alarm to the North Atlantic Group. The United States has agreed to bear half of France's war expenses in Vietnam in 1953, totaling 500 million U.S. dollars. The United States is also instructing the council of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc to pass a proposal to "continuously support" France's invasion of Vietnam, plotting to strengthen armed intervention in Vietnam. Under the urging of the United States, British munitions and military supplies to aid the French invading forces in Vietnam are being shipped to Vietnam; Thai reactionary dictator Luang Phibunsongkhram has also openly clamored that he will send seven battalions of Thai troops to Vietnam as scapegoats. All of these indicate that the U.S. and French imperialists have not learned their lesson from failure and are still preparing to use more cannon fodder and money as a bet to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    However, "U.S. aid" cannot save the failure of the French invaders. According to French President Vincent Auriol, the American interventionists have given the French invading forces 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in "aid" over the years, but the French army has repeatedly been defeated and is becoming more and more miserable, and they transfer "U.S. aid" military supplies to the Vietnamese People's Army in a turn of the hand. In the Autumn-Winter Offensive, the People's Army seized enough firearms to equip five regiments and hundreds of tons of ammunition and other military supplies, almost all of which were "U.S. aid" materials. Facts have proven that "U.S. aid" will only strengthen the United States' intervention in Vietnam and deepen the contradictions between U.S. and French imperialism. The U.S. interventionists are using the magic claw of "aid" to seize Vietnam's economic monopoly and seize control and command of the Bao Dai puppet regime and the puppet army. Because the French invaders are unable to carry out the war of aggression against Vietnam alone, they have to "quench their thirst with poison" and accept U.S. "aid" and intervention, but the contradictions of this bandit-style "cooperation" are developing more and more.

    Greater victories await the Vietnamese People's Army; complete failure awaits the French invaders and the U.S. interventionists.

### 越南人民军在秋冬攻势中的胜利

    越南人民军在秋冬攻势中的胜利
    在过去一年中，越南解放战争有了更大的发展。随着和平城的解放，反“扫荡”战的胜利，越南人民军展开了秋冬攻势，赢得了西北部各次战役的重大胜利。在这一攻势中，人民军从红河打到黑水江、马江，连续攻下义路、琼崖、万安、木州、山萝、奠边府和马江等重要城镇据点，包围了那岑和莱州城，歼灭了法国侵略军一万四千多人，解放了西北部百分之八十以上的土地和四分之三的人民。在此之前，法国侵略者曾经自吹自擂地说：“我们已取得主动，越盟军绝对无力进攻我们的西北基地。”越南人民军的铁拳彻底粉碎了这种无耻的谎言。
    越南人民军在北越西北部的胜利，使得越南战争形势发生了新的变化。目前，从莱州以南到木州沿黑水江的二百七十公里战线上，法军只剩下那岑一个孤立据点；从奠边府到马江的整个前法军马江军分区，已完全解放；人民军还控制了由奠边府和由木州通往寮国的两条公路。因此，人民军不但扩大并巩固了北越解放区；而且向南可以和中越的解放区、游击区连成一片，加强对红河三角洲敌军的威胁；向西可以和寮国解放区接连起来，增加法国侵略者在寮国战场的困难。
    在越南以至整个印度支那战场上，法国侵略军是越来越陷入被动挨打的境地了。
    秋冬攻势的胜利，说明越南人民军愈为强大了。他们不仅可以在游击战和运动战中战胜敌人，而且在攻坚能力方面也大大加强了。义路、敦交、木州、山萝都是法军的重要据点，但人民军都能很快地把它们拔除；在进攻安州时，二十四小时前进了三十公里，表现了坚强的战斗力。从战斗中增强了装备的人民军，已掌握了较多的重武器，而使法军惊呼“越盟军炮火猛烈”了。同时，人民军的连续作战能力也显著地提高了。自解放义路后，将近三个月来，人民军一直保持攻势，打得法军得不到喘息的机会。在各次战役中，人民军充分发挥了灵活性和机动性。法军在义路区遭到惨败后，曾冒险进犯富寿地区，企图挽救它在西北区的危局；这时人民军一面在端雄英勇阻击，一面抓住敌人后方空虚的弱点，在河内以南的发艳、兴安和南定等地区主动出击，震动了敌人的心腹重地，使法军首尾不能兼顾，不得不从富寿地区狼狈溃退，从而保证了西北区人民军胜利渡过黑水江。当困守那岑的法军依靠空中增援进行垂死挣扎时，人民军一面紧缩包围圈，一面突然挺进到寮国边境，攻克法军据点芒匈、芒林、那勒，解放了全部马江区。
    秋冬攻势中，越南人民军在政治上也取得重要胜利。法国侵略者为了实现其“以战养战”、“用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，在占领区强拉壮丁，充当侵略炮灰；苛征暴敛，吮吸人民膏髓；并建立所谓自治区（如在西北区的“泰族自治区”），企图分化越南各族人民的团结。但是，这种无耻的阴谋已一再破产了。由于越南人民军的不断胜利和正确执行宽待俘虏政策的影响，伪军成排成连地向人民军投降的现象，已经愈来愈多了。在西北区战斗中，伪军向空中放枪，一受包围就大批缴枪，有百分之八十做了俘虏。欧非籍法军的情形也是一样，逃跑、哗变和投降等等反战运动正在日益增长中。同时，由于越南劳动党、民主政府和人民军坚决执行胡志明主席的团结全国人民的政策，在敌占区，越南人民除了积极参加游击队之外，还挖掘秘密地道，反抗法国侵略者和傀儡政府的疯狂抓丁。他们突破法军的封锁，用物资支援人民军和游击队，与解放区人民共同为民族解放而斗争。泰族人民在解放前秘密护养人民军伤病人员，解放后纷纷回家生产，在民主政权下过着自由的生活，并积极展开支援前线的工作。
    另一方面，法国侵略者在侵越战争中的损失愈来愈大。法军在一九五二年全年伤亡八万人，几乎等于过去五年伤亡总和十七万人的二分之一。根据法国官方公布：法国侵越军费在一九五一年花费了二千八百三十亿多法郎，到了一九五二年，就增加到五千六百九十亿法郎了。这显然是有意缩小了的数字，实际上要比这个数字大得多。这就是法国侵略者进行“肮脏战争”的代价。
    越南人民军在秋冬攻势中的巨大胜利，引起了法国统治集团的惊慌。法国国防部长普利文叫嚷“印度支那的负担太沉重了，法国一国负担不起！”法国政府除了将一九五三年侵越军事预算增加到五千八百九十亿法郎之外，并准备将保大伪军从十二万人扩充到十六万人，以弥补法军兵源枯竭的困难。同时，法国政府又向美国乞求更多的“援助”，甚至向北大西洋集团告急。美国已答应在一九五三年负担法国侵越战费的一半，总数将达五亿美元。美国并指使北大西洋侵略集团的理事会通过一个“不断支持”法国侵越的提案，阴谋加强对越南的武装干涉。在美国的督促下，英国援助侵越法军的军火和军事供应品正在运往越南；泰国反动独裁者銮披汶也公开扬言将派出七营泰军到越南做替死鬼。所有这些，说明美法帝国主义还没有从失败中得到教训，还在准备用更多的炮灰和金钱作为扩大侵越战争的赌注。
    然而，“美援”并不能挽救法国侵略者的失败。据法国总统阿里奥尔供认，连年来，美国干涉者已给予侵越法军二十二亿美元的“援助”，但法军仍然屡战屡败，愈败愈惨，并且一转手就把“美援”军火“输送”给越南人民军。人民军在秋冬攻势中就缴获了足够装备五个团的枪械和成百吨的弹药及其他军事供应品，这些几乎全部都是“美援”物资。事实证明，“美援”只会加强美国对越南的干涉，并加深美法帝国主义间的矛盾。美国干涉者就是利用“援助”这双魔爪来攫取越南的经济垄断权，并夺取对保大傀儡政权和伪军的控制权和指挥权。法国侵略者由于无力单独进行侵越战争，不得不“饮鸩止渴”接受美国的“援助”和干涉，但这种强盗式“合作”的矛盾是越来越发展了。
    更大的胜利在迎接越南人民军；彻底的失败在等待法国侵略者和美国干涉者。
