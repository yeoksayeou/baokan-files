    To the Central People's Government, the Great Chairman Mao: On the joyous occasion of the New Year of 1953, I, on behalf of all the monks and laypeople of Tibet, extend to you my New Year's greetings. Under your leadership, Tibet has achieved peaceful liberation, all fraternal nationalities of China have united as never before, and the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality has also been unprecedentedly strengthened. In order to consolidate national defense and help build a new Tibet, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has established hospitals in Lhasa and other places over the past year, relieving countless monks and laypeople in Tibet from the suffering of illness; it has also reclaimed many barren lands for production, and the highway from Taizhao to Lhasa has begun construction; Lhasa Elementary School has been established and houses have been built and other construction work has been carried out, achieving great results in a very short period of time. The Tibetan Local Government has done everything possible to help with the above construction projects. We hope that the Central People's Government will provide greater assistance in 1953, and the Tibetan Local Government will also do its best to do a good job in various construction tasks. We firmly believe that the future prosperity of Tibetan religion, the prosperity of the region, the happy lives of monks and laypeople, and the construction of a new Tibet will surely be realized. Finally, I wish the Central People's Government longevity! Long live the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China, Chairman Mao! Long live the great unity of all fraternal nationalities in China!

    Respectfully, the Dalai Lama of the Tibetan Local Government

    Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, January 1st: Panchen Erdeni sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on New Year's Eve to congratulate him on the New Year. The telegram reads as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

    As the fourth New Year of New China is about to arrive, Panchen respectfully leads all the political, religious, monastic and secular officials and people of Tashilhunpo in Rear Tibet in extending our New Year's greetings to you from afar!

    Recalling the past year, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army, the lives of the people in Rear Tibet have become increasingly prosperous. Farmers along the Yarlung Tsangpo River achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1952. Herdsmen in the north drove herds of cattle and sheep to the agricultural areas to exchange for grain; handicraftsmen received loans from banks; merchants were able to remit money through banks; and in particular, medical teams cured many patients. The people of Rear Tibet all know that "Chairman Mao is our savior!" Every household has hung up your photo; this unexpected new atmosphere is entirely the result of your wise inspiration and the leadership of the Central People's Government. In addition to my heartfelt gratitude, I will resolutely further strengthen unity under the leadership and assistance of Representative Zhang Jingwu of the Central Government and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, and strive to welcome the large-scale economic construction of the country in 1953 and gradually do a good job in various tasks in Rear Tibet. Finally, I respectfully wish you boundless blessings and longevity.

    Panchen Erdeni

    【新华社拉萨二日电】西藏地方政府达赖喇嘛于新年前夕，致电毛主席庆贺新年。电文如下：
    中央人民政府、伟大的毛主席：当此一九五三年新年佳节，我谨代表西藏全体僧俗人民向您祝贺新禧。在您的领导下，西藏得到了和平解放，中国各兄弟民族空前的团结起来了，西藏民族内部也得到空前的团结。为了巩固祖国国防，帮助建设新西藏，进驻西藏的人民解放军一年来在拉萨和各地设立医院，使西藏的无数僧俗人民减除了疾病的苦难；并开垦了许多荒地，进行生产，从太昭到拉萨的公路已开始修筑；设立了拉萨小学以及修建房屋等建设工作，在很短的时间内，取得了很大的成绩，西藏地方政府对上述各项建设事业均尽了一切可能的帮助。希望中央人民政府在一九五三年给以更大的帮助，西藏地方政府亦将尽全力做好各项建设工作。我们坚决相信今后西藏宗教的兴隆，地方的繁荣，僧俗人民的幸福生活，新西藏的建设等一定能够实现。最后祝中央人民政府万岁！中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！中国各兄弟民族大团结万岁！
    西藏地方政府达赖喇嘛敬上
    【新华社日喀则一日电】班禅额尔德尼于新年前夕，打电报给毛主席祝贺新年，电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    新中国第四度新年行将届临，班禅恭率后藏札什伦布全体政教僧俗官员民众，向您遥叩新年之喜！
    回忆过去一年来，在解放军热情的帮助下，后藏人民的生活已日渐向荣。雅鲁藏布江沿岸农民一九五二年获得了空前未有的大丰收。北方牧民赶着成群集队的牛羊到农区交换粮食；手工业者得到银行的贷款；商民办货得到银行的汇兑；尤其是医疗队治好了很多病人。后藏人民都知道了“毛主席是我们的救星！”家家户户都挂了您的照片；这种想不到的新气象，完全是您英明的感召和中央人民政府领导的结果。我除衷心感谢外，今后决在中央张经武代表与驻藏人民解放军的领导和帮助下，进一步加强团结，为迎接一九五三年全国大规模的经济建设与逐步做好后藏的各种工作而奋斗。最后敬祝您福寿无疆为祷。
    班禅额尔德尼
