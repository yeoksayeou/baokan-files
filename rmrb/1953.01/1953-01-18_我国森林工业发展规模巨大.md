China's forest industry is developing continuously with the development of large-scale national economic construction and the large demand for timber. In the past three years, the number of timber production has increased year by year. For example, if the timber production figure in 1950 is 100, it increased to 184 in 1951; it is expected to increase to 198 in 1952. In order to cooperate with the large-scale national economic construction in the future, the timber production in 1953 will increase by more than 40% compared with the estimated completion amount in 1952.

At present, forest industrial organizations and workers are also increasing day by day. The Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions, which are the richest in forest resources, only had scattered forest industrial units during the period of Japanese and puppet occupation. However, after the liberation of the Northeast, the General Bureau of Forest Industry was established in 1950. Currently, under the leadership of the Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government, six forest industry administrations, twenty-nine sub-bureaus, and one forest industry experimental bureau have been established. Many regions within the customs have also successively established forest industrial organizations due to the needs of national economic construction. For example, the Southwest Region established a logging company in 1950; the Northwest Region also established a logging farm in the same year; the Central South Region established the Central South China Timber Company and branch companies in various provinces at the beginning of 1951; Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui provinces in East China, which produce timber, all established logging companies in 1952.

Due to the development of the forest industry, some cities serving forestry construction have gradually formed in and near forest areas. Yichun in the south-central part of the Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeast China is one of them. Hundreds of trains transport valuable timber to factories, mines, and other construction sites in this emerging forestry city every day.

The development of the forest industry is also reflected in the mechanization of production equipment and the improvement of operating techniques. In the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, the main bases for timber supply in China, there are currently thousands of kilometers of narrow-gauge forest railways and flatcar routes. Large railways specially designed for transporting timber are also extending to forest areas.

In the main forest areas of Northeast China, new-style machinery—electric saws and power saws—has begun to be used experimentally in logging operations, and tractors are used for transporting timber. The number of mechanical river outlets in rafting is also increasing day by day. Last year, the number of mechanical river outlets increased by more than two and a half times compared with 1949. Changing from handicraft production to mechanized production is a pioneering work in the history of Chinese forestry, which brings unlimited brilliant prospects to the forest industry.

The development of China's forest industry is inseparable from the help of Soviet forestry experts. Taking the Northeast forest area as an example, since Comrade Dainov, a Soviet expert, arrived in 1949, great improvements have been made in logging and transportation operations. Under his guidance and help, the forest industry in the Northeast region has implemented rational logging, rational timber production, ice-breaking operations (that is, breaking the ice in the river before thawing to advance the rafting time), and fixed-point rafting. This has greatly improved the timber production rate and product quality, so that about 600,000 cubic meters of timber can be saved every year. At the same time, the difficulty of rafting due to small water volume has been overcome, and the rafting loss rate has been reduced from 7% in 1949 to 1.022% in 1952. In some areas of Northeast China, the work method of year-round operation has begun to be tried out in logging, which has found a new direction for the development of the logging industry.

The broad masses of forestry workers are constantly improving their operating methods in their work, which also plays a significant role in the development of the forest industry. For example, the "mixed grouping" labor organization created by forestry workers in Northeast China organically coordinates the specific division of labor in logging, delimbing, and clearing forest farms, which increases labor productivity by more than 50%. In order to overcome the difficulty of transporting timber in mountainous areas, forestry workers in Northeast China have also created many rationalized timber transport tools—various styles of wooden tracks and wooden carts, which have created favorable conditions for transforming seasonal operations into year-round operations.

The biggest problem currently facing the forest industry is the shortage of forest resources. Therefore, in the future, we must plan to cultivate and expand forest resources and strengthen basic forestry construction. In terms of the technology of the forest industry itself, we must solve the difficulty of timber transportation, strengthen the proportion of mechanization in logging, timber transportation, and timber production, gradually stabilize the forestry workers who used to be mobile, improve technology, improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and gradually realize year-round operations to meet the needs of the motherland's large-scale economic construction.

    我国森林工业发展规模巨大
    【本报讯】　随着国家大规模经济建设的开展和对木材的大量需要，新中国的森林工业正在不断的发展中。三年来，木材生产数量已逐年增加，如以一九五○年的木材生产数字为一百，一九五一年就增为一百八十四；一九五二年预计增加为一百九十八。为了配合今后国家大规模经济建设，一九五三年木材的生产量，将比一九五二年预计完成的数量还要增加百分之四十以上。
    目前森林工业的机构和工人也日渐增多。森林资源最丰富的东北和内蒙地区，在日伪侵占时期只有分散经营的森林工业单位，但在东北解放后，一九五○年就成立了森林工业总局，目前在东北人民政府林业部领导下，已成立了六个森林工业管理局，二十九个分局，和一个森林工业实验局。关内许多地区由于国家经济建设的需要，也相继成立了森林工业机构。如西南区在一九五○年成立了伐木公司；西北区也在同年成立了伐木场；中南区在一九五一年初建立了中南区木材公司和各省的分支公司；华东区生产木材的浙江、福建、安徽三省在一九五二年都成立了伐木公司。
    由于森林工业的发展，林区和林区附近也逐渐形成了若干服务林业建设的城市。东北小兴安岭中南部的伊春，就是其中的一个。这个新兴的林业城市，每天有数百辆列车把珍贵的木材输送到工厂、矿山和其他建设工地。
    森林工业的发展还表现在生产设备的机械化和作业技术的改进上。在我国木材供应的主要基地东北和内蒙，目前已有数千公里的窄轨森林铁路和平车路线。专为运输木材的大铁路也正在向林区延伸。
    东北各主要林区在采伐作业中已开始试用新式机械——电锯、动力锯伐木，拖拉机运材。在流送中的机械出河数量也在日渐增加中。去年机械出河数量，比一九四九年增加两倍半以上。由手工业生产改变为机械化生产是中国林业史上的创举，它给森林工业带来了无限光辉的前途。
    我国森林工业的发展是和苏联林业专家的帮助分不开的。以东北林区说，自从一九四九年苏联专家达依诺夫同志到达以后，采运作业上有了很大的改进。东北区的森林工业在他的指导和帮助下，实行了合理采伐、合理造材、刨冰作业（即在开冻前，把河里的冰刨开，提前流送时间）和定点流送等。这样就大大提高了造材率和产品的质量，因而每年可以节约木材约六十多万立方公尺，同时克服了水小不能流送的困难，流送损失率也由一九四九年的百分之七降低到一九五二年的百分之一·○二二。东北少数地区在采伐中已开始试行常年作业工作法，给采伐工业找到了新的发展方向。
    广大的林业工人在工作中不断地改进作业方法，对发展森林工业上的作用也是很大的。例如东北林业工人创造的“混合编组”的劳动组织，把伐木、打桠、清理林场等工作具体分工有机配合起来，使劳动生产率提高百分之五十以上。为了克服山地集运木材的困难，东北林业工人还创造了许多合理化的运材工具——各种式样的木轨道和木车，为转变季节性的作业成为常年作业创造了有利条件。
    目前森林工业所遇到的最大问题是森林资源的不足。因此今后必须有计划地努力培养与扩大森林资源，加强林业基本建设。在森林工业本身技术上，要解决木材运输困难，加强伐木、运材和造材工作中的机械化比重，使过去流动的林业工人逐步固定起来，提高技术，提高劳动生产率，降低成本，逐步实现常年作业，以满足祖国大规模经济建设的需要。
