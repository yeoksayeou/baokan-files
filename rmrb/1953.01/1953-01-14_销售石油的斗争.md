    The Struggle to Sell Oil
    Qián Chéngdá
    China's oil industry is developing rapidly, with oil production increasing day by day and quality improving day by day. The oil we purchase from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries is also being shipped to our country in a steady stream. Therefore, the China Petroleum Company has sufficient oil to supply the needs of various production and consumption sectors in our country. In the past six months, oil sales have increased month by month. Sales in August last year increased by 48% compared to July, September by 20% compared to August, October by 9% compared to September, and November by 12% compared to October. The oil sales volume in the five months from July to November 1952 reached 81% of the total sales volume for the entire year of 1951, an increase of more than 70% compared to the same period in 1951. This achievement was primarily obtained after struggling against and overcoming the ideas of worshiping American and British companies.
    Correcting the Superstition of "Three Foreign Firms" Oil and the Ideology of Worshiping the United States and Britain
    In our country, some people were quite stubbornly superstitious about the "Three Foreign Firms" oil of American and British imperialism. The so-called "Three Foreign Firms" are the American Standard Oil Company of New York (Mobil), the American Texaco Company, and the Asiatic Petroleum Company. In the past, China's oil market was monopolized by these "Three Foreign Firms." Before liberation, when many American and British machinery and automobile merchants shipped machinery, automobiles, and even some simple components to China, they always specified in the usage instructions that Mobil (or Texaco, or Asiatic) oil must be used for smooth operation. They even deliberately stipulated that a certain part of a certain machine could only use a certain type of oil from a certain one of the "Three Foreign Firms." This type of advertising had deeply poisoned some oil users, and they were accustomed to it, to the point where they had to use oil from the "Three Foreign Firms." Therefore, the process of China Petroleum Company selling oil after liberation was also a process of struggling against the superstition of "Three Foreign Firms" oil and the ideology of worshiping the United States and Britain. Here is a real example:
    Dozens of textile factories in Shanghai needed a large quantity of spindle oil. They would rather pay a high price to search for spindle oil from the "Three Foreign Firms" than use the inexpensive and high-quality Soviet spindle oil. Some people said that Soviet spindle oil was dark in color, thick in texture, and high in viscosity, which would affect the rotation speed of the spindles. At the end of July 1952, the East China District Company of China Petroleum Company formed a test group to conduct comparative experiments of Soviet spindle oil and "Three Foreign Firms" spindle oil at the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory and the privately-owned Shenxin No. 9 Factory in order to refute this nonsense. After two months of continuous use, it was proven that Soviet spindle oil applied to spindles with speeds of 12,000 rpm and 8,000 rpm had completely normal rotation speeds, which shows that the claim of dark color, thick texture, and high viscosity affecting rotation speed was utter nonsense. At the same time, it was also proven that Soviet spindle oil had more advantages: 1. It has less acid than the "Three Foreign Firms" spindle oil, does not corrode the spindles, and can prolong the life of the machine parts. 2. Tube spindles originally needed oiling every eight days with "Three Foreign Firms" spindle oil, but can be oiled every twelve days with Soviet spindle oil, increasing the safe period by 50%. 3. The evaporation loss rate of "Three Foreign Firms" spindle oil is 2.5%, while the evaporation loss rate of Soviet spindle oil is 0.16%, which can reduce production costs. More importantly, Soviet spindle oil is cheap, has ample inventory, and can be supplied continuously. At the end of September last year, the China Petroleum Company invited representatives from eighteen large textile factories in Shanghai to a symposium, where representatives from the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory and the privately-owned Shenxin No. 9 Factory reported the results of two months of trial use of Soviet spindle oil. Faced with these vivid facts, the representatives of each factory began to discover and review the past erroneous thinking of superstition about "Three Foreign Firms" spindle oil, and successively signed oil use contracts with the China Petroleum Company.
    Mobilizing Charcoal Vehicles to Switch to Gasoline
    In the past, the source of gasoline was not smooth and the price of oil was very expensive, so many cars were converted into charcoal cars. Now, China Petroleum Company can supply a large amount of gasoline, and there are more places across the country that need wood, so wood should be used sparingly. When the petroleum company mobilized charcoal vehicles to switch to gasoline, many people insisted that using charcoal was cheaper than using gasoline and were unwilling to convert. These people did not calculate the accounts clearly, and they did not understand that the operating costs of gasoline cars and charcoal cars have been balanced or close to balanced. According to statistics from Sichuan Province: the operating cost per ton-kilometer for charcoal vehicles is 1,248 yuan, while the operating cost per ton-kilometer for gasoline vehicles is 1,249 yuan. Using gasoline is not only safer and more stable, but also extends the life of the car, increases the load capacity, facilitates engine starting, saves engine oil, saves manpower, accelerates travel speed, and is beneficial to the health of drivers and passengers. According to statistics from Shandong Weifang Private Automobile Company: for every 10,000 kilometers of travel, gasoline cars can reduce one major repair and two intermediate repairs compared to charcoal cars. The annual utilization rate of gasoline cars is generally 300 days, while charcoal cars are only 200 days. Petroleum companies in various places held symposiums with public and private transportation industries, systematically comparing the operating costs, utilization rates, repair rates, and labor safety for porters and drivers of gasoline cars and charcoal cars, and launched a campaign to convert charcoal cars into gasoline cars. The public and private transportation industries in many regions have done this, and all those who have converted charcoal cars into gasoline cars have been very popular with passengers.
    Promoting Kerosene to the Countryside
    In the vast rural areas of our country, except for Shandong, Guangdong, and other places, farmers mostly use vegetable oil for lighting. People call kerosene foreign oil and think it is too expensive and are unwilling to spend money to buy it for lighting. Therefore, to promote kerosene to the countryside, it is necessary to give farmers a detailed calculation to see what kind of oil is beneficial to themselves and the country. At the same time, it is also necessary to break the ideology of worshiping the United States and Britain that is superstition about "Three Foreign Firms" oil. Efforts should also be made to solve the problem of kerosene lamps. Petroleum companies have organized more than 200 mobile teams to go to the countryside to promote kerosene sales. According to experiments in Etang Village, Linyi County, Shandong, one catty of kerosene can replace two catties of soybean oil or three catties of peanut oil for lighting. The price of each catty of kerosene is equivalent to 0.765 catties of peanut oil in Tianjin, 0.827 catties of peanut oil in Shanghai, and 1.37 catties of rapeseed oil in Chongqing. Lighting with kerosene lamps is bright, clean, and cheap, and saving vegetable oil can not only be used for food, but also can be sold in small quantities to purchase machines, which is beneficial to the country and oneself. These facts and principles are easily accepted by farmers. Explaining that the "Three Foreign Firms" are tools of American and British imperialism's economy and aggression makes it easier for farmers to break the superstition about "Three Foreign Firms" kerosene. Regarding the issue of kerosene lamps, on the one hand, old stocks can be collected and utilized, but more importantly, new, inexpensive, and high-quality kerosene lamps must be manufactured, and cooperatives and private peddlers must be mobilized to promote kerosene and kerosene lamps to the countryside.
    Getting through the minds of cooperative cadres and rural party and government work cadres, so that they understand the importance of kerosene going to the countryside, and asking them to assist in publicizing to the peasants and calling on the peasants to use kerosene is the key to kerosene going to the countryside. Therefore, their thinking must be straightened out before kerosene can smoothly go to the countryside. Henan Province's reliance on cooperatives and obtaining the support of rural party and government work cadres, after two months of work, increased the proportion of the rural population using kerosene from 30% in September 1952 to 60% in November, which is a good example.
    Now, there are still many places in the vast rural areas that do not use kerosene. Oil trade workers and cooperative staff still need to work hard to eliminate these "blank spots."

    销售石油的斗争
    钱承达
    我国石油工业的发展是很迅速的，石油产量一天比一天多，质量一天比一天好。我们从苏联和各人民民主国家购买的石油，也源源运到我国。因此，中国石油公司有充足的石油，能够供应我国各生产部门和消费部门的需要。近半年来，石油的销售量逐月增加，去年八月比七月增销百分之四十八，九月比八月增销百分之二十，十月比九月增销百分之九，十一月比十月增销百分之十二。一九五二年七月至十一月五个月中的石油销售量，达一九五一年全年销售量的百分之八十一，比一九五一年同期增加了百分之七十以上。这种成绩，首先是和某些人崇拜美英的思想作斗争，并战胜这种思想以后取得的。
    纠正迷信“三行”石油、崇拜美、英的思想
    在我国，若干人曾经相当顽固地迷信美英帝国主义的“三行”石油。所谓“三行”，就是美国的美孚洋行，美国的德士古洋行和亚细亚洋行。过去我国的石油市场，是被这“三行”垄断的。解放以前，许多美、英的机器商人和汽车商人把机器、汽车、甚至一些简单的机件运到中国时，总要在用途说明书中规定：必须用美孚行（或德士古行，或亚细亚行）的油脂，才能运转自如。甚至故意规定某一机器的某一部分，只能使用“三行”中某行某号的油品。这种广告术，使若干用油者中毒很深，他们习以为常，大有非“三行”石油不用之势。因此，解放以后中国石油公司销售石油的过程，也就是和迷信“三行”石油、崇拜美、英的思想作斗争的过程。这里先举一个现实的例子：
    上海的几十家纺织厂需要用大批的锭子油，他们曾经宁愿出高价去搜罗“三行”的锭子油，而不愿用价廉物美的苏联锭子油。有人说，苏联锭子油色深、质厚、粘度大，会影响纺锭的转动速度。一九五二年七月底，中国石油公司华东区公司为了打破这种胡说，特组成试验小组，到国营上海第十七棉纺织厂和私营申新九厂进行苏联锭子油和“三行”锭子油的对比实验。经过两个月连续试用，证明苏联锭子油应用在每分钟一万二千转速和八千转速的纱锭上，转动速度完全正常，这说明所谓色深、质厚、粘度大，影响转动速度的说法，是彻头彻尾的胡说。同时还证明了苏联锭子油有更多的优点：一、它比
    “三行”锭子油的酸质小，对纱锭无腐蚀作用，能延长机件寿命。二、管式纱锭原来用“三行”锭子油须八天加油一次，用苏联锭子油可十二天加油一次，安全期增加百分之五十。三、“三行”锭子油的蒸发损耗率为百分之二点五，苏联锭子油的蒸发损耗率为百分之零点一六，可以降低生产成本。更重要的是苏联锭子油的售价低廉，存货充足，并可源源供应。去年九月底，中国石油公司邀请了上海十八家大纺织厂的代表开座谈会，由国营上海第十七棉纺织厂和私营申新九厂的代表报告了两月来试用苏联锭子油的结果。各厂代表在这种活生生的事实面前，开始发现并检讨了过去迷信“三行”锭子油的错误思想，相继和中国石油公司签订了用油合约。动员木炭汽车改烧汽油
    过去，汽油来源不畅，油价很贵，不少汽车改装成木炭汽车。现在，中国石油公司能够供应大量的汽油了，而全国需要木料的地方更多，应该大大节用木料。石油公司在动员木炭汽车改烧汽油时，许多人硬说用木炭比用汽油便宜，无论如何不愿改装。这些人没有算清帐目，他们不懂得汽油车和木炭车的行车成本已经平衡或接近平衡了。据四川省的统计：木炭汽车每吨公里的行车成本为一二四八元，汽油汽车每吨公里的行车成本为一二四九元。用汽油不但行车安全稳妥，而且能延长汽车寿命，加大载重量，便利引擎发动，节约机油，节用人力，加快行车速度并且有益于司机和乘客的卫生。据山东潍坊私营汽车公司的统计：每一万公里行程中，汽油汽车比木炭汽车可减少一次大修，二次中修。每年的出车率，汽油车一般是三百天，木炭车只有二百天。各地石油公司召开了公私运输业座谈会，把汽油汽车和木炭汽车的行车成本、出车率、整修率和对搬运工人、司机的劳动安全作了系统的对比，发动了把木炭汽车改装为汽油车的运动。许多地区的公私运输业都这样作了，凡是把木炭汽车改成汽油汽车的，都很受乘客的欢迎。
    推动煤油下乡
    我国广大农村中，除山东、广东等地以外，农民点灯多用植物油。人们把煤油称为洋油，认为它价钱太贵，不愿花钱买它点灯。因此，推动煤油下乡，必须给农民算细帐，看看到底点什么油对自己和对国家有利。同时也要击破迷信“三行”油的崇拜美、英的思想。还应设法解决煤油灯的问题。石油公司曾经组织了二百多个流动小组下乡推销煤油。根据山东临沂县莪堂村的实验，点灯时一斤煤油可顶二斤豆油或三斤花生油。而每市斤煤油的价格，在天津等于零点七六五市斤花生油，在上海等于零点八二七市斤花生油，在重庆等于一点三七市斤菜油。点煤油灯又亮又干净又便宜，省下植物油不仅可供食用，而且可以小销，购买机器，这对国家对自己都有好处。这些事实和道理，农民是很容易接受的。说明“三行”是美、英帝国主义的经济和侵略的工具，农民更易破除对“三行”煤油的迷信。关于煤油灯的问题，一方面可以搜集利用旧存的，但更重要的是还须制造新的价廉物美的煤油灯，并且要发动合作社和私商小贩把煤油、煤油灯往乡下推销。
    打通合作社干部、农村党政工作干部的思想，使他们认识煤油下乡的重要意义，请他们协助向农民作宣传，号召农民使用煤油，这是煤油下乡的关键。所以必须打通他们的思想，煤油才能顺利下乡。河南省依靠合作社，并取得农村党政工作干部的支持，经过两个月的工作，使全省农村人口用煤油的比例，由一九五二年九月的百分之三十增至十一月的百分之六十，就是很好的例子。
    现在，广大农村没有用煤油的地方还多得很，还待石油贸易工作者和合作社工作人员大大努力，去消灭这些“空白点”。
