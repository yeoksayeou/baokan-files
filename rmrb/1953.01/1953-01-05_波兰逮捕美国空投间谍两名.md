Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: The Polish Press Agency reported on December 27th that Poland captured two spies and saboteurs airdropped by American aircraft, who confessed in detail the evil sabotage activities the American intelligence agencies wanted them to carry out.

On November 4, 1952, an American aircraft that took off from Wiesbaden in the American occupation zone of West Germany, after passing through West Germany, Bornholm Island, and Sweden, intruded into Polish airspace about 20 kilometers from Darłowo, Poland, and continued 70 kilometers inland, dropping two spies and saboteurs and equipment near Miasteczko Krajeńskie district, Mzdów, Koszalin Province. Subsequently, the aircraft returned along the original route.

The spies and saboteurs airdropped by the American aircraft, Stiepan Skrzyszowski and Dionizy Sosnowski, had received specialized training in sabotage, espionage, and radio operator training classes organized by the American intelligence agencies. Their mission when airdropped into Poland was to gather intelligence and engage in sabotage activities that would harm the Polish state. The equipment dropped by the American aircraft included a radio transceiver, a camera, weapons, instructions, codes, etc. All of these things were used to carry out espionage and sabotage missions.

The Warsaw "People's Tribune" published an editorial on December 29th stating: This action by American imperialism against a country that maintains normal diplomatic relations with the United States is a brazen act of shameless violation of international law. This action eloquently proves the anti-Polish conspiracy of the American ruling clique. The editorial emphasized that only murderers who massacre unarmed prisoners of war on Koje-do Island and Geoje Island would commit such deeds. The People's Tribune continued: The American imperialists have prepared everything for the saboteurs, except one thing, namely "the support of the Polish people." This explains why the "reception" the saboteurs airdropped by the American aircraft received in Poland was arrest by the public security organs, and this is the "reception" prepared in People's Poland for all other foreign spies and all domestic traitors.

### 波兰逮捕美国空投间谍两名

    波兰逮捕美国空投间谍两名
    【新华社三日讯】据波兰通讯社十二月二十七日讯：波兰捕获了美国飞机空投的间谍与破坏分子两名，他们详细供认了美国情报机关要他们进行的罪恶的破坏活动。
    一九五二年十一月四日，一架自西德美国占领区的威斯巴登起飞的美国飞机经过西德、波荷尔姆岛和瑞典、在距离波兰达尔洛沃约二十公里处侵入波兰领空，并继续深入七十公里，在柯萨林州米亚斯特科夫区米兹多夫附近投下两个间谍和破坏分子及装备，随后，该机即沿原来航路折返。
    美国飞机投下的间谍和破坏分子斯梯潘·斯克齐斯佐夫斯基和迪奥尼齐·索斯诺夫斯基曾在美国情报机关所组织的破坏分子、间谍及无线电报务员训练班受过专门训练。他们被空投到波兰境内所奉的使命就是刺探情报和从事危害波兰国家的破坏活动。美国飞机投下的装备有一个无线电收发报机、摄影机、武器、指示、电码等。所有这些东西都是用来执行刺探情报及破坏的任务的。
    华沙“人民论坛报”十二月二十九日为此发表社论说：美帝国主义对于一个与美国保持着正常外交关系的国家采取这种行动，是肆无忌惮地破坏国际法的无耻行为。这种行动雄辩地证明了美国统治集团的反波阴谋。社论强调指出，只有屠杀蜂岩岛上和巨济岛上赤手空拳的战俘的凶手们才会干出这种勾当来。人民论坛报继续说：美帝国主义给破坏分子们准备的东西，件件俱全，只是缺少一件，那就是“波兰人民的支持”。这一点就说明了为什么被美机空投下来的破坏分子在波兰所受到的“接待”就是公安机关的逮捕，在人民波兰境内准备好了的对于其他一切外国间谍分子和国内一切卖国贼的“接待”，也是这样。
