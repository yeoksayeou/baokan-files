Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Shanghai's democratic parties have telegraphed the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), warmly endorsing the proposal put forward by the Chinese Communist Party to convene the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels this year, and to begin preparations such as drafting the election law and the draft constitution. The text is as follows:

To the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

Your Standing Committee's 43rd meeting heard the Chinese Communist Party propose convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels this year and beginning preparatory work such as drafting the election law and the draft constitution. This shows that our great motherland is about to enter a new historical period. We, the entire membership of the democratic parties in Shanghai, unanimously and enthusiastically hail this great proposal and express our sincere support.

For more than three years, under the correct leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country have carried out political and social reforms and economic recovery work, and have also carried out the sacred War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and have achieved brilliant achievements and great victories. On the basis of these glorious victories, our country will begin its first national five-year construction plan this year. In order to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, so as to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the national construction cause, convening people's congresses at all levels is completely correct and in line with the requirements of the people of the whole country. The people's congress system is the basic political system of our country and the best and most basic organizational form of people's democratic power. We, all members, guarantee to stand firmly with the people of the whole country, work hard to prepare for the convening of the People's Congress, and work hard to cooperate with and participate in the large-scale economic construction of the country!
