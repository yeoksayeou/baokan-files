Editor's Note: After the publication of Cui Bawa's "Selling a Child to Repay a Debt" on the third page of this newspaper on January 8th, many readers wrote to praise this work and expressed a desire to see his other works and learn about his writing process. Today, we are publishing "How Cui Bawa Writes" and "The Dogs are Biting Again" (originally published in the "Masses Daily" in Xi'an on January 19th). The former vividly introduces Cui Bawa's process of learning culture and writing, as well as his gains, which is very enlightening and encouraging for the children of workers and peasants to learn culture and writing; The latter is another good work by Cui Bawa.

The quick literacy method created by Comrade Qi Jianhua solved the problem of cultural learning for millions of cadres and soldiers of worker and peasant origin in the army; the emergence of the long novel by literary soldier Comrade Gao Yubao gave them great encouragement and help in their creative work. In the literary and sports review of our unit on October 1st last year, we received more than 500 poems, quick talks, communications, autobiographies, and short and long novels written by comrades. According to the results of the selection by the regiments, fifteen articles were awarded first prizes and thirty-nine articles were awarded second and third prizes. Ninety percent of these works were written by comrades of worker and peasant origin in our unit, and the vast majority were written by comrades who had just learned more than 2,000 characters after the unit promoted the quick literacy method. A relatively successful work is the nine novels, including "The Dogs are Biting Again" and "Selling a Child to Repay a Debt," written by Comrade Cui Bawa, a correspondent from our hospital. He is still continuing to create, and has completed a draft of nearly 40,000 words. Everyone who has read Comrade Cui Bawa's works praises them, so he is called the second "Gao Yubao" by his comrades.

Comrade Cui Bawa is twenty-four years old this year and is from Ankang County, Shaanxi Province. He joined our army in 1949 and is a member of the Communist Youth League. His family background is that of a farm laborer. He lived a life of hardship from an early age. He did odd jobs for the landlord at the age of six and herded cattle for the landlord's family from the age of thirteen. No matter how heavy the rain or snow, how strong the cold wind, or how hungry he was, he couldn't go back until the cattle had eaten their fill. Sometimes when the wind and snow were too heavy and his tattered clothes couldn't keep him warm, he would cover his body with straw to herd cattle for the landlord. At that time, he ate wild vegetables, coarse bran, tree roots, and bark. During famine years, he even ate "Guanyin clay" to fill his stomach. One year, because he couldn't pay the landlord's rent grain, his family sold him to the landlord, and he had to part with his own parents in pain. ... His life can be said to have been subjected to the cruel oppression and exploitation of landlords and despots, and he lived an extremely poor and painful life.

It was absolutely impossible for Cui Bawa to go to school in the old society. One day when he was nine years old, he was just standing at the entrance of a school listening to the sound of reading in the school, when he was seen by the landlord. The landlord went up and slapped him a few times, scolding him: "Damn it! If you come here again, I'll beat you to death. Hmm! Piss in your own bladder and see what kind of person you are!" At that time, Cui Bawa retorted a couple of times. The next day, Cui Bawa's father kowtowed many times and said many good words in front of the landlord to get him to let it go. Therefore, when Cui Bawa first joined the army, he didn't even know the three characters "Cui Bawa."

After joining the army, under the constant education of the Party and superiors, Cui Bawa has always been active and diligent in his work and study. During production in 1950, he was a hero and made meritorious contributions. In the cultural study movement in 1952, he was elected as the division's meritorious model representative and attended the Northwest Military Region's meritorious model representative meeting. Even so, he still hadn't learned much. Before participating in the quick literacy method study, he had only learned 528 characters, and most of them he didn't know how to use or write. He often heard some comrades talk about the contents of novels and dramas such as "Turning Over a New Leaf," "Blood and Tears of Vengeance," and "Avenging Hatred." At that time, he also thought: if I knew how to read, I would write about my past suffering so that everyone would know. At the same time, he deeply felt that lack of culture had a great impact on his work as a correspondent. For example, once he went to the Organization Section of the Political Department to deliver a letter and passed the Organization Section office five times, but he still didn't know where the Organization Section was. Also, once the instructor asked him to notify the time of the meeting, but because he couldn't read, he mistook the morning meeting for the afternoon, which caused a loss to the work. Usually, when superiors gave lectures and reports, he couldn't take notes. Because of these reasons, coupled with the task put forward by the superiors to build a modern national defense army and the need to learn culture and master modern weapons, this further strengthened his determination to learn culture.

The introduction of the quick literacy method in the army brought great excitement to Cui Bawa. He was so happy that he couldn't sleep for several nights and bought a notebook and ink a few days earlier, preparing to study hard. At first, the leadership also regarded Cui Bawa as a typical example of the quick literacy method and designated the director instructor, Comrade Zhang Jiaxian, to specifically help Cui Bawa. After the hospital convened a mobilization meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists for cultural learning, Cui Bawa first made up his mind: to ensure that he would not fall behind, to learn wherever the instructor taught, and to complete the task of 2,300 characters. He also proposed to do his best to complete the tutoring task in the quick literacy method, to help comrades who were slow in learning to keep up with the team, and to carry out learning competitions with other comrades.

On the first day, he spent only two hours and forty minutes learning the phonetic symbols, and he moved all thirty-six letters home and his pronunciation was also very accurate. In the phonetics stage, in addition to completing his own tasks of single, double, and triple phonetics within the specified time, he also helped seven comrades learn phonetics. In the blitz of learning new characters, the instructor required the completion of 350 characters every day, and he successfully completed them before 12:00 noon on the same day.

Just as Cui Bawa was actively studying, no one in the animal husbandry squad was feeding the horses, so the superiors transferred him to feed the horses. Cui Bawa thought at the time whether this would affect his studies, but he also thought that he was a member of the Communist Youth League and a people's soldier, and as long as he had determination and confidence, there were no difficulties that could not be overcome. So he bravely accepted the task assigned by his superiors. Another comrade in the animal husbandry squad named Xiong Mingyou did not participate in all the learning because of feeding the horses. Therefore, he complained to the leaders all day long, saying: "Feeding the horses! It's really unlucky. If you want to learn, don't call me to feed the horses. If you call me to feed the horses, I'll never learn well in my life!" Cui Bawa was not only not affected by this in the slightest, but he used his own practical actions to solve Comrade Xiong Mingyou's ideological problems. On the one hand, he explained to Comrade Xiong that as long as he had determination, there was no reason not to learn well. On the other hand, he offered to feed more horses himself so that Xiong Mingyou would have more time to study. In this way, in less than a week, he turned a Xiong Mingyou who was passive in his work and unwilling to study into a comrade who was active in his work and determined to study. One day, the instructor Zhang Jiaxian called Cui Bawa to his room and said to him: "The comrades in the hospital have all caught up with the team in the blitz of learning new characters, but Guo Juqing is the only one who has fallen behind. Many comrades have tutored him but haven't solved the problem. I wanted to ask you to tutor him, but I'm afraid that you have a lot of work and it will delay your own studies..." Before the instructor finished speaking, Comrade Cui Bawa immediately replied: "Can I just recognize the characters myself and just watch the comrades fall behind?" He also said: "Although I have a lot of work, I have this determination and I guarantee that the tutoring will be successful..." After the instructor agreed, Cui Bawa quickly signed a contract with Guo Juqing to guarantee teaching and learning, and they studied together all day long. He learned that Guo Juqing thought that the blitz of learning new characters was very difficult, and he couldn't remember too many characters in a day. He then introduced his own learning situation and methods to Guo Juqing, so that Guo Juqing quickly completed the task of blitzing new characters. During reading, he read a sentence and had Guo Juqing read a sentence, and also completed the task of tutoring Guo Juqing in reading. Shi Shuyin and Wang Fucang of the communications squad reflected: "It's so tight every day, even if you cut off my head and pour it in, it won't go in." After learning about these situations, he used his own example of how to study attentively to explain to these comrades and break through their thinking. In language learning, the superiors asked him to serve as the leader of the study group. He first solved the problems of comrades in the group who were afraid of learning and those who caused disunity, so that all the comrades in the group could complete the reading tasks designated by the superiors before 12:00 noon every day. During the reading process, he also went on business trips four times, driving a large cart to pull coal forty miles away from the garrison. In order to consolidate and familiarize himself with the new characters, he used his horsewhip to draw the characters he had learned in the sky while driving the cart. Once, while he was drawing and writing like this, a branch on the side of the road scratched his face. Twice he returned from business trips late, and everyone had gone to class. In order not to miss class, he did not go to eat first, but picked up his textbook and homework and went to the classroom to listen to the instructor's lecture. Although he was on business trips, he never lacked his daily homework. Many comrades in the hospital said: "Comrade Cui Bawa is really good at learning, no matter how busy he is, it will not delay his studies. We should learn from his spirit of hard study!"

During reading, Cui Bawa paid special attention to the ideological content of the text or the application of every word and sentence. He always read each article several times, then closed the book, recalled and understood the central meaning and ideological feelings of the article, memorized the main words and sentences in the text, and repeatedly thought about why the author wrote it this way and what the advantages of writing it this way were. Sometimes he would circle good words and sentences with a pen, or specifically copy them into a notebook, preparing to use them in the future. If he encountered a sentence he didn't understand, he would also write it down and ask the instructor to explain it in detail afterwards. This is how Cui Bawa studied carefully and diligently.

After the composition began, although he had a foundation in language learning, he also felt the same difficulties: "No way to start," "Nothing to write," and even if he wrote an article, he couldn't grasp the center, the words and sentences were not smooth, and he couldn't distinguish the paragraphs. He believed that the main reason was that he hadn't studied enough, so he continued to work hard. Once, after reading the article "Because I am a Member of the Communist Youth League" in the sixth volume of the national language textbook, he repeatedly thought about how this article was written? What were the main things it wrote about? Why didn't it write about other things? In particular, when everyone discussed the article "Seventeen Warriors Crossing the Dadu River" in the national language textbook, Cui Bawa raised many questions for discussion, such as why this article only wrote about the bravery of the seventeen warriors in crossing the Dadu River, and not about their previous experiences? After a thorough understanding, he also proposed that the reason why this article was written well was also because it wrote about the power of the enemy and the strictness of the enemy's firepower, but at the same time it also wrote that the heroic seventeen warriors were even more powerful than the enemy and fought regardless of sacrifice. If we only wrote about our bravery without writing about the ferocity of the enemy, then this article would be weak, and our warriors would appear ordinary and commonplace. ... The discussion of language learning was of great help to Cui Bawa's writing. In particular, after Cui Bawa clearly understood how to grasp the center of the article, it increased his confidence in writing boldly, and Cui Bawa's manuscripts gradually appeared on the wall newspaper.

When he entered the formal language learning course, Cui Bawa sat in the yard one day and wanted to find a theme to write a manuscript, but he couldn't find any material after thinking about it again and again. Later, when he saw an umbrella, he thought about what the umbrella looked like? What was its use? How good it would be to have this umbrella when he went to deliver letters in the rain, so that he wouldn't get the documents wet, and he wouldn't get his clothes wet. ... After thinking for a long time, Cui Bawa didn't dare to pick up his pen. At this time, he saw some bullets basking in the sun, and he thought about the bullets: What is a bullet? What is its use? What contribution has it made to the revolution in the past and today? What happens to American imperialism when it encounters bullets? ... This is how he thought more and more, and he always felt that writing about bullets was more valuable than writing about umbrellas. Just as he was about to ask the instructor for advice, the instructor Zhang Jiaxian happened to come to understand what difficulties he had in learning to write. Cui Bawa told the instructor about these two ideas, and Zhang Jiaxian explained the principle that writing articles should first find things that are meaningful and that you are familiar with. At the same time, he talked about the use of bullets and umbrellas, and which was bigger and smaller for the interests of the revolution and the people, and enlightened Cui Bawa. So he followed the instructor's words and wrote a quick report on "Bullet Head." The first time, he wrote it very long, even writing about where the bullet was born and grew, who used it, how it was used, how it got to the front line ... etc., without a center. After the instructor gave his opinions, pointed out the advantages and disadvantages, and asked him to rewrite it, Cui Bawa was not discouraged and continued to write. By the time he wrote it for the third time, Cui Bawa's "Bullet Poem" was already very good, and the structure of the paragraphs and sentences was very clear and concise. Since then, Cui Bawa has written more quick talks, poems, and short articles one after another, which have all been well received by everyone. At this time, he also thought how good it would be to write about his past suffering, but when he thought about the fact that there were so many things in the old society, thousands of threads and ends, what should he write about? He couldn't make up his mind at all. After Zhang Jiaxian learned about this situation, he helped him and slowly enlightened his memories. Sometimes when Cui Bawa thought about the pain, he would sob. Zhang Jiaxian tried various ways to help him restrain his emotions and encouraged him to turn hatred into strength. On the other hand, he asked many questions to increase his knowledge and gain much enlightenment. In this way, after more than a month of specific help, Cui Bawa had greatly improved his political ideology, and he had more confidence and determination in his writing. When he started writing his first novel, he wanted to write about the sound of "dog bites" that he was most afraid of at home. He wrote a few paragraphs and took them to the instructor to ask for his opinion. After reading it, the instructor pointed out that the reasons for "being afraid of dog bites," why the dog bites, and why other people are not afraid were not clearly written, and asked him to rewrite it. He also told him many reasons why dogs bite in the old society. The next day, when practicing composition, Zhang Jiaxian told everyone about the article "Afraid of Dog Bites" written by Cui Bawa and gave a composition topic based on the content of the article written by Cui Bawa: "The Dogs are Biting Again," and asked all the comrades in the hospital who were learning culture to try to write it. On the same day, Cui Bawa wrote the article "The Dogs are Biting Again" and handed it over to the instructor for revision. After reading it, Zhang Jiaxian felt that it was well written, the events were very real, and the words and sentences were also very colloquial, but it lacked the depiction of characters. He immediately pointed out these advantages and disadvantages to Cui Bawa and asked him: "When the dog bites, the village chief and landlord come, what are the expressions of your parents and brothers? What are some of their actions?" Cui Bawa gestured while talking: "The village chief and landlord are really evil, they angrily opened the door, and our whole family was so scared that we didn't know what to do. We wanted to run, but there was nowhere to go. My younger brother was trembling and crying under my mother's clothes ... My father sighed, and my mother was so scared that she couldn't speak ..." Zhang Jiaxian immediately told him that writing articles was the same as speaking, and to write about whatever situation there was. He also said that it would be even better to write about the actions and expressions he had just mentioned. Cui Bawa immediately returned to the dormitory and slowly recalled the situation at that time, and rewrote it according to the instructor's opinion. After writing it for the fourth time, the content of the article, the language, and the characters were all used and expressed appropriately. In particular, the language was very colloquial and popular, and the things written were very realistic and moving. After reading it, Zhang Jiaxian immediately read the article to everyone and posted it for everyone to read. He also encouraged him to continue writing like this and talked to him about the topic selection for the second article. The hospital's Party branch also decided to give him convenience in terms of time so that he could engage in writing. Encouraged and helped by the Party and his comrades, Cui Bawa became even more motivated, so he worked even harder to write his novels.

Before the literary and sports review of our unit on October 1, 1952, Cui Bawa's two articles, "The Dogs are Biting Again" and "Selling a Child to Repay a Debt," had been sent to the division. After some responsible comrades read them, they all felt that the content of Cui Bawa's works was educational, and the language was also real, vivid, and colloquial, and they were very good soldier works. The director of the Political Department of the division, the head of the Culture Section, and others personally asked Cui Bawa to talk about the situation before and after writing. Comrade Liu Sanduo, head of the Culture Section, also introduced Gao Yubao's arduous writing situation to him, and gave Cui Bawa a copy of "Liberation Army Literature," Volume 1, Issue 6 (which contained an article introducing Gao Yubao's writing process), as well as pens, ink, and paper needed for writing. At the same time, he also told the leaders and instructors of the hospital on the phone to specifically help and cultivate Comrade Cui Bawa. During the literary and sports review on October 1st last year, Cui Bawa's work was rated first and won a first prize. Since then, the division has also specially compiled Cui Bawa's learning methods and writing situation into Shandong quick talks to publicize to the comrades of the army at opportunities such as holding large meetings, and invited him to give reports in various units. All of this has given Cui Bawa's writing great encouragement. As Cui Bawa said: "Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I would never have dreamed that I could receive such great education and honor." The Culture Section of the division also specially convened a meeting of cadres from relevant departments and decided that Comrade Duan Xinghua of the section would be responsible for cultivating this "Gao Yubao-style" Cui Bawa's creation. Now Comrade Cui Bawa has also completed the first drafts of more than a dozen articles such as "Cowherd," "A Wine Pot," "Revenge," "Building an Airport," and "Going on Assignment." Although his works still have many shortcomings, with Cui Bawa's efforts, coupled with the leadership's attention and cultivation, we believe that he will definitely have better and more literary works appear, and he will definitely be able to complete the long novel that he is currently writing.

We hope that Cui Bawa will continue to work hard and create boldly and courageously, and learn from Comrade Gao Yubao!

    崔八娃是怎样进行写作的
    西北军区某部  柳三朵整理
    编者按：一月八日本报第三版登载了崔八娃的“卖子还账”后，许多读者来信称赞这篇作品，并希望看到他的其他作品和他学习写作的经过。今天在这里发表的“崔八娃是怎样进行写作的”和“狗又咬起来了”（原载一月十九日西安“群众日报”），前者具体生动地介绍了崔八娃学习文化和写作的经过和收获，对于工农子弟学习文化和写作有很大的启发和鼓舞作用；
    后者是崔八娃的另一篇好作品。
    祁建华同志创造的速成识字法，解决了部队中千百万工农出身的干部和战士学文化的问题；文艺战士高玉宝同志长篇小说的出现，更给予他们创作上以极大的鼓舞与帮助。我部在去年十月一日文艺体育检阅中，收到五百多篇同志们写的诗歌、快板、通讯、自传以及长短篇小说等。根据各团评选结果，曾有十五篇被评为一等奖，三十九篇评为二、三等奖。这些作品百分之九十是我们部队工农出身的同志们的，其中绝大多数又是部队在推行速成识字法后刚认识两千多字的同志们所写。比较成功的作品要算是我部医院通讯员崔八娃同志所写的“狗又咬起来了”“卖子还账”等九篇小说。他现在还继续进行创作，并且已经完成了将近四万字的文章底稿。凡是看过崔八娃同志的作品的人无不连连称赞，因此，他被同志们称为第二个“高玉宝”。
    崔八娃同志今年二十四岁，陕西省安康县人，一九四九年参加我军。是一个青年团员。家庭是雇农成分，从小就过着牛马生活，六岁就给地主做小活，十三岁起给地主家放牛。不论是雨雪下的再大，冷风刮的再厉害，肚子再饿，反正牛吃不饱，他是不得回去的。有时风雪太大了，身上的破烂单衣无法御寒，他便用稻草遮着身体，为地主放牛。那时，他吃的是野菜粗糠、树根树皮，灾荒年间还以“观音土”来充饥。有一年，因还不起地主的租稞，家里就将他卖给地主，与自己的亲生爹妈忍痛分离。……他的一生可以说是受尽了地主恶霸的残酷压榨与剥削，过着极其穷困痛苦的生活。
    崔八娃在旧社会想上学读书是万万不可能的。九岁那年，有一天他刚站在一个学校门口听学校里读书的声音，谁知被地主看见，地主上去就是几个耳光，并大骂着说：“他妈的屁！你再到这来非打死你不成。嗯！尿泡尿看看你是啥人！”当时，崔八娃顶了两句，第二天，崔八娃的父亲因此还在地主面前磕了许多头，说了许多好话，才算饶了过去。因此，崔八娃刚参军时，连“崔八娃”三个字都不认识。
    参军后，在党和上级不断教育下，崔八娃工作、学习一贯积极努力。一九五○年生产时，当过英雄立过功。一九五二年文化大学习运动中，又当选为师的功臣模范代表，出席了西北军区功臣模范代表大会。虽然如此，他还是学的不多，在未参加速成识字法学习以前，他只学会了五百二十八个字，绝大多数还不会用，不会写。他时常听一些同志们谈到“翻身记”“血泪仇”“雪恨”等小说剧本的内容，当时他也想：自己要认识字的话，把自己过去受苦的事也写出来，叫大家知道。同时他深感到没有文化对通讯员工作有很大的影响，如某次他到政治部组织科送信，从组织科办公室前过了整五次，但还不知道组织科在那里。又如某次指导员让他通知开会时间，因他不识字把上午开会看成下午，使工作受到损失。平时上级给讲课、做报告时，想记点笔记也没法记。由于这些原因，加上上级又提出建设现代化的国防军，必须学好文化掌握现代武器的任务，这就更坚定了他学习文化的决心。
    速成识字法在部队介绍后，给崔八娃带来了极大的兴奋。他喜得几晚上都睡不着觉，在早几天就买了本子和墨水，准备好好学习。当时领导上一开始也把崔八娃当做速成识字法典型培养的对象，并指定主任教员张家先同志专门帮助崔八娃。当医院召开了党、团、积极分子动员文化学习会议以后，崔八娃首先下定决心：保证不掉队，教员教到那里学到那里，一定完成两千三百字的任务。并提出在速成识字中要尽力去完成辅导任务，帮助学习慢的同志跟上队，并与其他同志展开学习竞赛。
    第一天，在学注音符号中，他只用了两点四十分，就把三十六个字母全部搬了家，发音也很准确。拼音阶段他除了在规定时间完成自己的单拼双拼三拼音的任务外，还帮助七个同志也学会拼音。突击生字中，教员每天要求完成三百五十个字的任务，他都在当天十二点钟前胜利完成。
    正当崔八娃积极学习的时候，饲养班里没人喂马，上级就调他去喂马，崔八娃当时曾想到这是否对学习有影响，但他又想到自己是个青年团员，是一个人民战士，只要有决心有信心，没有克服不了的困难。于是他勇敢地接受了上级指示的任务。饲养班里另一个叫做熊名友的同志，因为喂马没有全部参加学习，因此，整天埋怨领导说：“喂马！真他妈倒霉，要学习就不要叫喂马，叫喂马就一辈子也学不好！”崔八娃不但没有因此受到丝毫影响，反而用自己的实际行动解决了熊名友同志的思想问题。他一方面给熊同志说明只要有决心没有学不好的道理，另方面又提出自己多喂马，让熊名友有更多时间去学习。就这样，不到一礼拜，就使一个消极工作，不安心学习的熊名友变成了一个工作积极而又有决心学习的同志了。有一天，教员张家先将崔八娃叫到自己屋里给他说：“医院的同志在突击生字中都赶上队，就是郭巨卿一个人掉队了，好多同志辅导都没解决，想让你去辅导，又怕你的工作多，耽误自己的学习……”教员话还没说完，崔八娃同志立即回答说：“单是自己认识了字，还能睁眼看着同志们掉队？”并说：“我工作虽多，可我有这个决心，保险辅导成功。……”教员允许后，崔八娃很快就和郭巨卿订立了包教保学条约，整天在一块学习。他了解到郭巨卿认为突击生字难得很，一天认的太多记不下。他便针对这问题给郭巨卿介绍了自己的学习情形和方法，使郭巨卿很快就完成了突击生字任务。阅读中间，他读一句，让郭巨卿念一句，又完成了辅导郭巨卿阅读的任务。通讯班的石书印、王复仓反映说：“一天这么紧，割了脑袋往内灌，也灌不进去。”他了解了这些情况后，便用自己如何专心学习的例子来向这些同志解释，打通了他们的思想。语文学习中，上级让他担任学习组长，他首先解决小组内怕学和闹不团结的同志的问题，使全小组同志在每天十二点前即能完成上级指定的阅读任务。在阅读中，他还曾出差四次，赶大车到离驻地四十里的地方拉煤，在拉煤中他为了巩固与熟悉生字，赶车时用马鞭子在天上划着已往学过的生字。有一次，正在这样画写时，路旁的树枝竟将他的脸挂破了。有两次出差回来较晚，大家都上课去了，他为了不误课，不是先去吃饭，而是拿起课本、作业先到课堂听教员讲课。虽然他出差，但是他每天的作业却从没有欠缺过。医院许多同志说：“崔八娃同志学习真好，再忙也不会耽误他的学习，我们应该学习他的刻苦学习的精神！”
    在阅读中，崔八娃对课文的思想内容或一字一句的应用都特别注意，每篇文章他总要阅读好几次，然后把书本合上，回忆和体会文章的中心大意和思想感情，牢记文中的主要词句，并反复思考作者为什么要这样写，这样写有什么优点等。有时他读到好的词句就用笔把它圈起来，或者专门抄在笔记本上，准备将来用。假若遇到文句不懂的地方，他也将它记下来，过后，请教员详细解释。崔八娃就是这样细心钻研地学习着。
    习作开始后，虽然他在语文学习中有了基础，但同样感到困难：“没法下手”，“没啥写的”，即是作一篇文也抓不住中心，词句也不通，段也分不清。他认为主要原因还是学习不够，于是便继续努力。有一次，他读了国语六册上“因为我是个青年团员”一篇文章后，他又反复思索这篇文章怎样写的？主要写了什么东西？为什么没写其他事情等。特别是大家讨论国语上“十七勇士抢渡大渡河”文章时，崔八娃提出了许多问题进行讨论，如提出这篇文章为啥只写在抢渡大渡河中十七勇士的勇敢，而不写他们以前的事情？经过深入的体会，他又提出这篇文章所以写的好也在于它写出敌人的厉害，敌人的火力射击严密，但同时也写出英勇的十七勇士比敌人更厉害，不顾一切牺牲进行战斗。假若只写我们勇敢，而没有把敌人的凶恶处写出来，那么这篇文章就没力，我们勇士也会表现得一般、平常。……语文学习的讨论，对崔八娃的写作有很大帮助，特别是崔八娃明确认识如何掌握文章的中心后，更增加了大胆写作的信心，墙报上也逐渐出现崔八娃的稿子了。
    当进入正规语文学习课程后，崔八娃有一天坐在院内想找个题材写稿子，可是想了又想找不到材料。后来他看到一把雨伞，他就想着雨伞像什么？他有什么用处？下雨时自己去送信有了这雨伞多么好，淋不湿文件，也淋不湿衣服。……想了很长时间后，崔八娃还没敢执笔。这个时候，他又看见一些子弹在太阳光下晒，他又想到子弹方面去：子弹是个啥东西？他有什么用处？过去与今天对革命有什么贡献？美帝国主义碰到子弹怎么样？……就是这样他越想越多，总觉得写子弹比写雨伞有价值。他正要请教教员时，教员张家先恰巧也来了解他学习写作有什么困难，崔八娃将这两个想法告诉教员，张家先就将写文章应先找意义大、自己熟悉的事物去写等道理讲了一番。同时又将子弹与雨伞的用处，对革命对人民利益那个大那个小讲了一下，启发崔八娃。于是他就照着教员的话去写“子弹头”的快报。第一次，他写得很长，连子弹生在那里长在那里，谁用它，怎样用，怎样到了前线……等都写上去，没有中心。经教员提了意见，指出优缺点后，让他重写，崔八娃毫不灰心，仍然继续写下去。直到第三次写出时，崔八娃的“子弹诗”已很不错，在段落、语句的结构上，都很明确、精练。此后，崔八娃接二连三写了更多的快板、诗歌与短文，都得到大家的好评。这时他也曾想着把自己过去受苦的情形写出来该多好，但是他一想到旧社会的事特别多，千头万绪，究竟写啥呢？自己一点也作不了主。张家先了解到他这个情况后，就进行帮助，慢慢启发他的回忆，有时崔八娃想到痛苦时，就泣不成声，张家先就一方面想各种办法去帮助他克制感情，鼓励他要把仇恨变成力量，另方面提出许多问题使他增加了许多知识，得到许多启发。就这样，经过一个多月的具体帮助，崔八娃在政治思想上有很大提高，对自己写作也更增加了信心和决心。开始写第一篇小说时，他想写自己以前在家最怕的“狗咬”声音，写了几段便拿去叫教员提意见，教员看后，提出文中对“害怕狗咬”的原因，狗为什么咬，别的人为啥不怕等问题写得不明确，让其重写，并又告诉了些旧社会狗咬的许多原因。第二天练习作文时，张家先就将崔八娃写的“害怕狗咬”这个文章告诉大家并按崔八娃写的这个文章内容出了一个习作题：“狗又咬起来了”，让医院全体学文化的同志都来试作。当天崔八娃就将“狗又咬起来了”这个文章写好交给教员修改。张家先看后感到写的还好，事情很真实，词句也很通俗，但是还缺乏人物性格的描绘，当即将这些优缺点给崔八娃提出来，并问他：“狗一咬，保长地主来了，你家里的爹妈兄弟都是怎样的表情？有些什么动作？”崔八娃就边说边比划：“保长地主实在恶，他们气冲冲地把门打开，我们一家人都吓的不知怎样才好，想跑了可没有地方去，弟弟在妈的衣服下叫着打颤……爹唉声叹气，妈吓的话也说不出来……”张家先立即告诉他写文章和说话是一样，有啥情形就写啥，并说刚才他所说的动作、表情要写上就更好了。崔八娃马上回到宿舍里慢慢回忆当时的情形，并按照教员的意见再写。第四次写好后，在文章内容上、语言上以及人物性格上都运用和表现得很恰当，特别是文字很通俗，大众化，写的事情也很逼真动人。张家先看后马上将这个文章读给大家听，并贴出来让大家看，还鼓励他继续这样写下去，并和他交谈写第二篇文章的取材问题。医院党支部并研究决定给他在时间上以便利，以便从事写作。崔八娃在党与同志们的鼓舞帮助下，劲头更大了，于是，更刻苦地写自己的小说。
    一九五二年十月一日我部文艺体育检阅前，崔八娃的“狗又咬起来了”“卖子还账”两篇文章，已送到师里，经过一些负责同志看后，都深感崔八娃写的作品内容有教育意义，语言也真实、生动、通俗，是很好的战士作品。师政治部主任、文化科长等都亲自叫崔八娃谈写作前后的情况，文化科长柳三朵同志并向他介绍了高玉宝艰苦写作的情形，给了崔八娃“解放军文艺”一卷六期一本（上边有介绍高玉宝写作经过的文章）和写作需用的笔、墨水、纸张等。同时又在电话上告诉该院领导同志和教员，要具体帮助和培养崔八娃同志。去年十月一日文艺体育检阅中，崔八娃的作品被评为第一，得了一等奖。此后，师内还专门将崔八娃的学习方法、写作情况编成山东快书利用开大会等机会向部队同志宣传，并请他本人在各单位作报告。这一切，都给予崔八娃的写作上以极大的鼓舞，正如崔八娃所说的：“不是共产党，毛主席，做梦也想不到我能得到这样大的教育和荣誉。”师文化科还专门召集有关部门干部会议，决定科内段星华同志负责培养这位“高玉宝式”的崔八娃的创作。现在崔八娃同志又已完成“放牛人”“一把酒壶”“复仇”“修机场”“支差”等十几篇文章的初稿。虽然他的作品还有许多缺点，但在崔八娃的努力下，加上领导上的重视和培养，我们相信他一定有更好更多的文艺作品出现，他一定能完成他现在正在进行写作的长篇小说。
    我们希望崔八娃继续努力，大胆地勇敢地创作下去，向高玉宝同志学习！
