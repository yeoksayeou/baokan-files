Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: The Chinese Red Cross Society issued the following statement on January 8th regarding the issue of assisting Japanese nationals in China to return to their home country:

    Regarding the issue of assisting Japanese nationals to return to their home country, since our society agreed to the joint organization of a delegation by the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee to come and negotiate, we have successively received telegrams from various Japanese parties other than the aforementioned three organizations, requesting that they send representatives to accompany the three organizations' delegation to China for negotiations. The task of the three organizations' delegation this time is limited to discussing with our society the procedures for Japanese ships and various specific issues related to the repatriation of Japanese nationals. Our society believes that in order to solve the difficulty of the lack of ships for Japanese nationals to return home, it is sufficient for representatives from the above three organizations to come and negotiate. As for the issue of wanting to visit China, it should be handled separately from the issue of negotiating the repatriation of Japanese nationals. After the above-mentioned three organizations have completed their negotiations on the issue of the repatriation of Japanese nationals, if the Japanese people wish to promote friendly relations between the people of China and Japan, organize an appropriate delegation to visit China, and are willing to receive a delegation sent by the Chinese people for the same purpose to visit Japan, then this matter will be considered by relevant people's organizations in our country.

    我红十字会就协助日侨回国问题发表声明
    【新华社八日讯】中国红十字会于八日就协助在中国的日本侨民回国问题，发表声明如下：
    关于协助日侨回国问题，自本会同意由日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络委员会共同组织代表团前来接洽后，我方又曾先后收到上述三团体以外日本若干方面来电，要求派遣代表随同三团体代表团前来我国接洽。此次三团体代表团前来，其任务仅限于与本会商谈日本来船手续以及日侨回国各项具体问题。本会认为：为了解决日侨回国缺乏船只的阻难，由上述三团体派遣代表前来接洽即已足够。至于欲来中国访问问题则应与接洽日侨返国问题分别办理。在上述三团体关于日侨返国问题接洽完毕以后，日本人民方面如愿促进中日两国人民间的友好关系，组织适当的代表团前来中国访问，并愿接待中国人民方面为了同一目的派遣代表团赴日本访问，那么此事将会受到我国有关人民团体的考虑。
