    On the Position of a North Korean Female Anti-Aircraft Machine Gun Platoon
    Chen Weiren
    October 25, 1952, somewhere on the eastern front in Korea, I visited two female anti-aircraft machine gun platoons of the Korean People's Army. In the Korean People's Army, many women, in order to strive for victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, demonstrated a high degree of ingenuity and courage, fighting on the front lines just like the men.

    The positions of these two platoons were on a steep and narrow mountain ridge. Standing here, countless large and small mountain peaks were all within sight. The winding road appeared and disappeared between the mountains, snaking its way up a thousand-meter-high mountain to the front lines. This was a newly built road by the People's Army, one of the countless supply lines from the rear of Korea to the front lines. This group of female anti-aircraft machine gunners were guarding the skies of their homeland here, protecting a section of this supply line. The youngest among them was only nineteen years old, and the oldest did not exceed twenty-five, most of whom had only enlisted when the war began. Most of them had previously worked as nurses in the People's Army, with a few coming from south of the 38th parallel, officially transferring from the guerrillas into the regular army when the People's Army launched a large-scale counterattack against the Syngman Rhee puppet army, advancing south. Now, many of them have become glorious members of the Korean Workers' Party.

    When we climbed up to their position along the sloping hillside, we were warmly welcomed by them.

    Life in the position was intense and arduous, but each of them was healthy, strong, and full of endless youthful vitality. On this day, they were all wearing neat new cotton military uniforms, and their red epaulettes shone in the sunlight, making them appear particularly heroic. Each of them had branches inserted into their belts, making it clear that they were in a combat environment.

    This place was very close to the front-line positions, and the sounds of artillery fire from the front lines were constantly heard, and the sound of heavy machine guns could also be faintly heard. The sound of artillery fire had not stopped all day; enemy shells screeched through the sky, exploding in a green vegetable field five hundred meters away from the road. Comrade Jin Changhai, who accompanied us and could speak Chinese, pointed to the smoke column and said, "Look, that is the enemy's bombing target; their indiscriminate shooting is just to embolden themselves." During the three hours that we stayed at the position, we encountered enemy aircraft more than five times, each time with three to five planes. These female anti-aircraft machine gunners did not bother with them every time. When we asked them if our conversation was hindering their combat, they smiled and said, "That's just passing through; it doesn't dare to fly low, so we don't shoot it!" These anti-aircraft machine gunners are old adversaries of the American planes, and they are already very familiar with the enemy's pulse.

    A year ago, enemy planes often flew low, skimming the treetops, but now they are afraid of not flying high enough, which seems to have become the enemy's "flying discipline." This change shows how timid the American air bandits are in front of these female anti-aircraft machine gunners!

    Regarding their heroic combat achievements and why they have become so firm and brave, one can fully understand what they are all like by simply looking at the experiences of their platoon leader and one of the gunners, Park Jin-ok. My conversation with her began with her expressing gratitude for the visit of Chinese friends.

    Park Jin-ok's home is in Najin, North Hamgyong Province, and she just turned twenty this year. Her father and mother were both revolutionaries who engaged in revolutionary activities for a long time. As soon as she was born, her father left her mother and her to live in exile, only returning to the country in 1940; because he continued to engage in the struggle against Japan, he was arrested by the Japanese invaders in 1944 and died in prison. Her mother was also arrested by the Japanese invaders in 1943 for participating in revolutionary work and only regained her freedom when the Soviet army liberated Korea.

    Because her family had so many unfortunate experiences, she said, "I didn't go to school during the Japanese puppet rule; in fact, it was impossible. During that period, I supported myself by helping people take care of children, guarding doors, and other labor. Especially after my father and mother were killed and arrested, life became even more difficult."

    In days when the fighting is so intense, and victory is increasingly heartening, a strong soldier will not be troubled by those past events.

    "So what happened after liberation? When did you become a soldier of the People's Army?" We changed the subject in this way.

    "Of course, it was completely different." A relaxed and happy expression flashed across her face, she regained her composure, and continued, "First of all, I was reunited with my mother, and in 1946, I was sent to Pyongyang Mangyongdae Revolutionary Martyrs' Children's School to study for three years."

    She left school in January 1949 to join the army. At first, she was a soldier in the guard unit of the People's Army Navy Headquarters. She was only seventeen years old at the time. The reason she joined the army was entirely of her own volition. Because her hometown was on the east coast, she loved the ocean since she was a child, so she joined the navy.

    After the outbreak of the Fatherland Liberation War on June 25, 1950, Comrade Park Jin-ok, in order to meet the needs of the war, joined a reconnaissance unit of the army as a scout. Being a scout requires political firmness, as well as fearless courage, resourcefulness, and a high degree of self-sacrifice. Obviously, she possessed these qualities and excellently completed the tasks assigned to her by her superiors. She has three military service medals, two of which were obtained at that time. Later, she followed the army south, liberating Daejeon and crossing the Nakdong River; she was a member of the vanguard force. During the battle to cross the Nakdong River, she was wounded in the leg and was sent to the rear for recuperation. After recovering from her injury, she was kept in the hospital as a nurse.

    At the beginning of 1952, when the People's Army prepared to systematically train a group of female anti-aircraft machine gunners, she was the first to sign up to participate. After a period of study, on June 14, she was assigned to her current position to shoot down planes. When we visited, their two machine gun platoons had already shot down one enemy plane each.

    During the learning process, her only difficulty was her shallow foundation in mathematics. But later, she squeezed more time to study on her own, and when her comrades were asleep at night, she quietly got up by herself to study. In order to quickly master the technology, she sometimes got up at night and disassembled and reassembled the machine gun over and over again on her own; sometimes she disassembled the machine gun, carried it on her back, and ran and climbed mountains. By the time of the summary in early June, she had become one of the best students. It was because of this that the superiors decided that she should be the main shooter.

    When they arrived at the position, their only thought was to shoot down more enemy planes. But after ten days had passed, they had not shot down any enemy planes, and they began to feel anxious; another month passed, and there were still no results. When they summed up their work, they found that the main reason for not being able to shoot accurately was that they were not calm, and their eyes closed as soon as they fired. After another period of hard training, they were slowly able to achieve not blinking when the gun fired. In order to strive for more practice opportunities, they aimed at the stars on clear nights and corrected deviations with each other. Sometimes they practiced until late at night.

    On the morning of August 10, nine enemy planes came to bomb the nearby anti-aircraft artillery position, and the leading plane had just tilted its body and was preparing to dive when Park Jin-ok's anti-aircraft machine gun roared, and watching the enemy plane, a flash of fire appeared on its body, and the fuselage crookedly dragged a trail of black smoke and crashed into the back of the mountain to the left. She said, "From this time on, I have become even more confident." Park Jin-ok's machine gun had shot down seven enemy planes in the hands of the Republic's hero, Wu Zhuzhe, and this was the eighth.

    Park Jin-ok is only one of the countless Korean women who are living and fighting so heroically and tenaciously for the victory of the Fatherland Liberation War.

    The thirteen female soldiers here, just as I saw in several other places, in addition to faithfully carrying out their combat missions, also cut down trees to build shelters, earthen houses, and dig tunnels themselves. They must take turns carrying their ammunition and food from more than twenty li away. The eastern front in Korea is a series of mountains, and twenty li cannot be without climbing mountains and crossing ridges.

    Park Jin-ok once led us to visit their residence, which was an ordinary earthen house built of pine wood and mud. There was a heated kang, and their luggage was neatly arranged on the head of the kang, and a row of PPSh submachine guns was hanging on a wooden frame. They also decorated the walls with pictorials, including a color photo of Chairman Mao reviewing troops at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. This was the fifth time I had seen these pictures in the homes of People's Army soldiers. The soldiers of the People's Army are extraordinarily concerned about China's prosperity, progress, and strength. I also saw a pile of newspapers and several very old books on one of their small tables. I asked her what they did besides shooting down planes during the day? She told me that they guarded the skies of their homeland while reading books and newspapers every day. These books were so old precisely because they had been read over and over by each of them.

    Brave Korean women live like this. When we left this position, Park Jin-ok and her comrades repeatedly told us that they very much hoped that Chinese friends would write letters to them, especially Chinese women, because they knew that women in New China, after liberation, also appeared in large numbers in various combat positions, which they were particularly happy about.

    在朝鲜女高射机枪班的阵地上
    陈维仁
    一九五二年十月二十五日，在朝鲜东部前线的某地，我访问了朝鲜人民军的两个女高射机枪班。在朝鲜人民军中，有不少妇女为了争取祖国解放战争的胜利，表现了高度的机智和勇敢，她们和男子一样战斗在最前线。
    这两个班的阵地，是在一座陡峻而狭长的山梁上。站在这里，无数大小山峰尽在眼底。蜿蜒的公路时隐时现在山峦之间，一直盘上千余公尺的高山通到最前沿。这是人民军新修筑的公路，是朝鲜后方到前线的无数条供应线之一。这群女高射机枪手，就在这里警卫着她们祖国的天空，保护这条供应线的一段。她们中年龄最小的只有十九岁，最大的也不超过二十五岁，大都是战争开始时才入伍的。她们大多数原来在人民军中做过护士工作，有少数人家在“三八线”以南，在人民军对李承晚伪军实行反击大踏步南进时，才从游击队正式转入正规部队来。现在她们许多人已经成为光荣的朝鲜劳动党党员了。
    当我们沿着倾斜的山坡爬上她们的阵地时，受到她们热情的欢迎。
    阵地生活是紧张而艰苦的，但是她们一个个都健康、结实，全身充满着无穷尽的青春的活力。这一天，她们都穿着整齐的新棉军装，红色的肩章在阳光下闪耀着光辉，她们显得特别英武。她们每个人的腰带上都插着树枝，一看就明白这是在战斗的环境里。
    这里离前沿阵地很近，前线的炮声不断地传来，重机枪声也隐约可闻。这一天炮声就没有断过，敌人的炮弹怪声怪气地划过天空，落在离公路五百公尺以外的一块青青的菜地里爆炸。同去的金长海同志会说中国话，他指着烟柱说：“你看，那就是敌人的轰炸目标，他们这种盲目的射击，只是为了自己壮壮胆色。”当我们在阵地上停留的三个钟头内，曾经遇到五次以上的敌机，每次三五架不等。这些女高射机枪手们并没有每次都理会它。当我们问她们是不是谈话妨碍了她们的战斗时，她们笑了笑说：“这是过路的，它不敢低飞，不打它！”这些高射机枪手和美国飞机是老对头了，她们已经非常熟谙敌人的脉搏了。
    一年前，敌人的飞机常擦着山顶树梢低飞，现在却是唯恐飞得不够高，这似乎已经成了敌人的“飞行纪律”了。这种变化，说明美国空中强盗在这些女高射机枪手的面前是多么胆怯！
    关于她们的英雄战斗事迹和她们为什么会变得这样坚定和勇敢，只要看看她们的班长和射手之一的朴金玉的经历，就完全可以明白她们全体是怎样的了。我和她的谈话是她以对中国友人的访问表示感谢而开始的。
    朴金玉的家在咸镜北道的罗津，今年刚满二十岁。她的父亲和母亲都是革命者，长期从事革命活动。她刚出生，父亲就离开母亲和她流亡在外，一九四○年方回国；因为继续从事反对日本的斗争，于一九四四年被日寇逮捕，死于狱中。她的母亲也因为参加革命工作，在一九四三年被日寇逮捕，直到苏军解放朝鲜才恢复了自由。
    因为她的家庭有那许多不幸的遭遇，她说：“在日伪统治时代，我是没有念过书的，事实上也不可能。那个时期，我是靠帮人家带小孩、看门等劳动来维持生活的。特别是父亲母亲被害被捕以后，生活就更加困苦了。”
    在战斗那样紧张，而胜利又是愈来愈振奋人心的日子里，一个坚强的战士是不会为那些往事所烦恼的。
    “那么解放以后怎么样呢？你什么时候成为人民军战士的？”我们就这样转换了话题。
    “当然就完全不一样了。”一种轻松愉快的情绪从她的脸上掠过，她恢复了平静，继续说：“首先是又和母亲在一起，一九四六年并被送往平壤万景台革命烈士子弟学校去读了三年书。”
    她是一九四九年一月离开学校参加部队的。开初是在人民军海军司令部的警卫部队里当战士。那时她只有十七岁。她所以要参加部队，完全出于她的志愿。因为她的家乡正在东海岸上，她从小就爱好海洋，所以她参加了海军。
    一九五○年六月二十五日卫国战争爆发后，朴金玉同志为了战争的需要，参加了陆军某侦察部队作侦察员。做侦察员特别需要政治上坚定，并具备大无畏的勇敢、机智和高度的自我牺牲精神。显然她是具备这些条件的，并且卓越地完成了上级所交给她的任务。她有三枚军功章，其中两枚就是在那时获得的。以后随军南下，人民军解放大田，横渡洛东江，她都是先头部队的一员。在强渡洛东江的战役中，她腿部负了伤，就被送往后方休养。伤愈以后，就被留在医院当护士。
    一九五二年初人民军准备有计划地培养一批女高射机枪手，她首先报名参加。经过了一个时期的学习，于六月十四日被派到现在这个阵地上来打飞机。我们去访问时，她们两个机枪班，已经各击落一架敌机了。
    在学习过程中，她的唯一困难是数学根底浅。但后来，她自己多挤时间学，晚上同志们睡了，就悄悄地一个人起来学。为了很快掌握技术，她有时夜间起来，自己摸索着一遍又一遍地把机枪拆开又装上；有时把机枪拆开背着跑步，爬山。到六月初总结时，她成为最优等的学员之一。就因为这样上级决定她当正射手。
    到了阵地上，她们唯一的想法就是希望多打下敌人的飞机。可是十天过去了，没有打下敌人的飞机来，心里就开始着急了；一个月又过去了，还是没有结果。她们总结工作时，发现打不准的主要原因，是不沉着，一开枪眼睛就闭了。又经过一番苦练，才慢慢地能够做到枪响不眨眼。为了争取更多的练习机会，在晴天的晚上，就瞄准星星，互相校正偏差。有时一直练习到深夜。
    八月十日的早晨，敌机九架来炸附近的高射炮阵地，为首的一架刚刚身子一斜，准备俯冲，朴金玉的高射机枪就吼叫了，眼看着敌机身上火花一闪，机身歪斜着拖着一道黑烟往左边山后栽了下去。她说：“从这次以后，就更加有信心了。”朴金玉的机枪曾经在共和国英雄吴柱哲烈士的手里击落过七架敌机，现在是第八架了。
    朴金玉只是无数的朝鲜妇女中的一个，她们为了祖国解放战争的胜利，就是这样英勇顽强地生活着和战斗着。
    这里的十三位女战士，正如我在另外几个地方看到的情况一样，她们除了忠实地执行自己的战斗任务之外，还自己伐木盖掩蔽部、地屋子、挖坑道。她们的弹药和粮食，必须自己轮流着到二十华里以外去背。朝鲜的东部战线是山连山的，二十里路也少不了要爬山过岭。
    朴金玉曾引我们去参观她们的住处，那是一座普通的用松木和泥土盖成的地屋子。有热炕，炕头整齐地摆着她们的行装，一个木架上长长地挂着一排转盘冲锋枪。她们还用画报把墙壁装饰起来，其中有毛主席在北京天安门检阅时的彩色画片。这是我第五次在人民军战士的屋子里看到这些图片了。人民军战士们对中国的繁荣进步和强大，是异常关心的。我还在她们的一个小桌上看到一堆报纸和几本已经十分破旧的书。我问她白天除打飞机外，还做些什么？她告诉我，她们每天一面警卫着祖国的天空，一面读书、读报。这几本书正是因为她们每个人都翻来覆去的看，才那样破旧了。
    勇敢的朝鲜妇女，就是这样生活着。我们离开这个阵地时，朴金玉和她的战友们一再嘱托：她们非常希望中国的朋友们给她们写信，特别是中国的妇女，因为她们知道新中国的妇女，在解放后，也像她们一样大量出现在各种战斗岗位上，这是她们特别引为高兴的。
