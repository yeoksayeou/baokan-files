    Oppose the American Conspiracy to Expand the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    In the six-year war of aggression against Vietnam, French imperialism has suffered significant defeats. In the last two months especially, the Vietnam People's Army has won new and enormous victories in northwestern Vietnam and the Viet Bac plains, eliminating 14,000 French aggressors and liberating 28,500 square kilometers of land and three-quarters of the people of the Northwest, plunging the French aggressors into an even more miserable situation.
    In this situation, the French aggressors are still trying to rely on American aid to salvage their irretrievable failure. American imperialism is not only preparing to further intervene in Vietnam, but also plotting to expand this war of aggression. At the December 1952 meeting, the North Atlantic aggressive group council, under American manipulation, passed the so-called "Proposal Regarding Indochina." In this "proposal," the North Atlantic aggressive group council stated that France's "war in Indochina should receive the continuous support of the North Atlantic governments." This fully exposes America's conspiracy to drag the North Atlantic group countries into the war of aggression against Vietnam. At the same time, the Thai reactionary government, which participated in the American war of aggression against Korea, openly promised the United States that it would send five battalions of infantry and two battalions of marines, approximately seven or eight thousand men, to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam in the first few months of 1953. The United States is also preparing to use the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The United Press said that Taiwan's Kuomintang's "concern for the current war in Indochina is probably second only to that of France." These all prove that the United States is also plotting to gather its vassal states in Asia and the reactionary forces it supports to expand its intervention in Vietnam.
    While the United States plans to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, it is also preparing to squeeze French forces out of Vietnam. The British "Times" stated that Eisenhower and Dulles both believe that France has a greater "defense mission" in Europe, therefore France's burden in Asia should be lessened. This means that the United States is demanding that France abandon its colonial privileges in Vietnam and be replaced by the United States. This attempt by the United States contradicts the interests of the French ruling clique. French Minister for Relations with Associated States in Indochina Letourneau recently stated that France only requests more assistance and does not agree to "internationalize" the Vietnam War, "because it would reduce France's freedom of action." With the further intervention of the United States in Vietnam, and with the strengthening of American "aid" to France, the contradictions between the United States and France will inevitably develop further.
    Neither French aggression nor American intervention can prevent the victory and liberation of the heroic Vietnamese people. The six-year history of the Vietnamese people's resistance war has already proven this. In fact, France's war of aggression against Vietnam has always been carried out with the active assistance of the United States. The intensified intervention by the United States is only using ineffective medicine to treat a more serious illness, and is destined to fail. The Vietnamese people and the people of the world will heighten their vigilance, oppose America's criminal plan to expand the war, and strengthen their struggle to defend peace and freedom.

### 反对美国企图扩大侵越战争的阴谋

    反对美国企图扩大侵越战争的阴谋
    法帝国主义在侵略越南的六年战争中，遭受了重大的失败，尤其在最近两个月中，由于越南人民军在越南西北部和越北平原又获得新的巨大胜利，歼灭了法国侵略军一万四千人，解放了二万八千五百平方公里土地和四分之三的西北部人民，而使法国侵略者陷入了更为悲惨的处境。
    在这种情况下，法国侵略者还企图依靠美国的援助，来挽救它已无可挽救的失败；而美帝国主义不但准备进一步干涉越南，并且阴谋把这个侵略战争扩大。一九五二年十二月召开的北大西洋侵略集团理事会，在美国操纵下通过了所谓“关于印度支那的提案”。在这个“提案”中，北大西洋侵略集团理事会表示，法国“在印度支那的战争应当受到北大西洋政府的不断的支持”。这充分暴露了美国企图把北大西洋集团国家拖进侵越战争的阴谋。与此同时，参加美国侵朝战争的泰国反动政府，竟公然答应美国在一九五三年头几月内派遣五营步兵和两营海军陆战队约七、八千人参加侵越战争。美国也准备利用台湾蒋介石匪帮的残余力量，参加侵越战争。合众社说，台湾国民党“对目前印度支那战争的关怀，恐怕仅次于法国”。这些都证明美国还阴谋纠集它在亚洲的附庸国家和它所扶植的反动势力，扩大干涉越南。
    美国一边策划把侵越战争扩大，一边准备把法国势力从越南排挤出去。英国“泰晤士报”称，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯都认为，法国在欧洲负有较大的
    “防御任务”，因此法国在亚洲的负担应减轻。这就是说，美国要求法国放弃它在越南的殖民地特权，而由美国来接替。美国的这一企图和法国统治集团的利益发生了矛盾。法国印度支那成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺最近就曾表示，法国只要求更多的援助，而不同意把越南战争“国际化”，“因为它会减少法国的行动自由”。随着美国对越南的进一步干涉，随着美国对法国的加强“援助”，美国和法国的矛盾必将更加发展。
    不论是法国的侵略，不论是美国的干涉，都不可能阻止英雄的越南人民的胜利和解放。越南人民抗战六年的历史已经证明了这一点。事实上，法国侵略越南的战争始终就是在美国的积极援助下进行的。美国的加紧干涉，只是用失效的药去救治更加沉重了的病，注定是要失败的。越南人民和全世界人民都将提高警惕，反对美国扩大战争的罪恶计划，而为保卫和平与自由加强斗争。
