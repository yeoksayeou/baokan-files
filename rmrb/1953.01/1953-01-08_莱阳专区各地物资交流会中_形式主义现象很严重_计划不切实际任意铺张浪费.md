According to correspondents Fan Zizhen and Sun Yigong: In October and November of last year, more than 40 primary market material exchange meetings were held successively in various parts of Laiyang Special District, Shandong Province. The total transaction volume increased significantly compared with the summer, and the business enthusiasm of private businesses was brought into play. These achievements should be affirmed. Before compiling the material exchange plans, various places had conducted investigations on the purchasing power of local farmers, and generally knew how much purchasing power the farmers had. However, they were clueless as to what, how much, what, and how much farmers currently needed to sell and buy in the local primary market. Therefore, the exchange plans were generally set very large and could not be completed. Some exchange meetings only completed one-third of the plan. Due to unrealistic plans, many commodities were out of stock at the exchange meetings. Iron farm tools, flashlights, and flashlight batteries were generally in short supply. On the other hand, many commodities were unsalable: such as fresh ginger from Zhaoyuan County and sweet potato dried from Qixia County, could not find buyers in the market. The situation of peanut oil and soybean oil being unsalable was also very serious.

Many cadres believed that the more people participated in the exchange meeting, the greater the achievements. Some counties deliberately exaggerated the number of people participating in the material exchange meeting when making summary reports. Some cadres, in order to mobilize the masses to participate in the exchange meeting, irresponsibly said that anything could be bought and sold in the exchange meeting. When the cadres of Wan'di District in Laiyang County went to mobilize the masses to participate in the exchange meeting, they said: "The public buys whatever the farmers sell, and the public guarantees whatever cannot be sold, and the public can also help buy whatever cannot be bought." The farmers complained when the native tobacco in Laiyang County could not be sold: "The cadres are just deceiving people, they don't want it after we bring it." Cadres in the Chengxiang District of Pingdu County told the masses: "There are operas and circuses at the exchange meeting, it is crowded and lively, everyone should go to participate." Therefore, many farmers and primary school students went to "go to the fair to watch the excitement" without buying or selling anything. In the Longkou exchange meeting, there were more people watching the opera than buying and selling goods. Restaurants, steamed bun shops, and food stalls were particularly prosperous, and the food was in short supply. Many people were very unhappy because they could not buy anything to eat.

It was common to stage operas and perform circuses at exchange meetings in various places, and the waste was very serious. Laixi County wanted to build a stage in the market, but could not find wood, so they cut down a batch of live trees in the countryside to build the stage. Zhaoyuan County planned to spend 14 million yuan to invite people from Longkou to perform operas at the exchange meeting in the city, but it was discovered and stopped by the higher authorities.

Some places scheduled the time of the primary market material exchange meetings too close together, and the locations were too close. For example, as soon as the material exchange meeting in Chengxiang, Huang County, was over, and there was not even time to make a summary, another material exchange meeting was held in Longkou, 35 miles away from Huang County. After Longkou was over, another material exchange meeting was held in Huangchengji, more than 30 miles away from Huang County. As a result, the transaction volume in Longkou and Huangchengji was very small. Furthermore, some exchange meetings were held for too long. For example, the exchange meeting in Hetoudian, Laixi County, lasted for six days. There were not many transactions in the last two or three days, and there were not as many people attending as on a normal market day, and many people attended to watch the opera.

The above-mentioned phenomena should be corrected in various places.

### 莱阳专区各地物资交流会中  形式主义现象很严重  计划不切实际任意铺张浪费

    莱阳专区各地物资交流会中
    形式主义现象很严重
    计划不切实际任意铺张浪费
    据通讯员范子真、孙翼功报道：山东省莱阳专区各地在去年十、十一两月先后召开了四十多个初级市场物资交流会，总交易额较夏季大有增加，并且发挥了私营商业的经营积极性，这些成绩都是应该肯定的。各地在编造物资交流计划前，对当地农民的购买力曾作过调查，大体上知道农民的购买力有多大；但对农民当前需要在本地初级市场上卖什么，卖多少，买什么，买多少，则是心中无数，因此交流计划一般都订得很大，不能完成。有些交流会只完成计划的三分之一。由于计划不切实际，在交流会中有许多商品脱销了，铁农具、手电筒、手电池普遍是供不应求。另一方面，也有许多商品滞销：如招远县的鲜姜、栖霞县的地瓜干，在市场上找不到买主。花生油、豆油滞销的情况也很严重。
    不少干部认为交流会上人越多成绩越大。有的县在作总结报告时就故意夸大参加物资交流会的人数。有的干部为了动员群众参加交流会，竟不负责任地说交流会中什么也能买得到，什么也能卖得出。莱阳县万弟集区干部去发动群众参加交流会时说：“农民卖什么，公家买什么，卖不出去的公家包，买不到的公家也能帮着买”。莱阳县的土烟销不出去，农民就埋怨说：“干部净欺骗人，我们拿来又不要了。”平度县城厢区的干部向群众说：“交流会上有大戏、马戏，人多、热闹，大家都应该去参加。”因此，许多农民和小学生不买不卖也去“赶会看热闹”。龙口交流会中，买卖货的人没有看戏的人多。饭馆、包子铺、食品摊的生意特别兴隆，食物供不应求，许多人买不到东西吃很不高兴。
    各地交流会中唱大戏、耍马戏是普遍的，这当中的铺张浪费现象很严重。莱西县要在市场上搭戏台，找不到木头，竟到农村砍了一批活树去搭戏台。招远县城开交流会时打算花一千四百万元到龙口请人去唱戏，后经上级发觉制止了。
    有的地方把初级市场物资交流会的时间排得太挤，地点相距太近。如黄县城厢的物资交流会刚开完，总结都来不及作，就又在距黄县城三十五里的龙口召开物资交流会，龙口开完，又在距黄县城三十多里的黄城集召开物资交流会，结果龙口和黄城集的交易额很小。再就是有的交流会时间开得太长，如莱西河头店的交流会开了六天，最后两三天的交易不多，到会的人还不及平常赶集的人多，而且到会的人多是为了看戏。
    上述种种现象，各地应注意纠正。
