To the Editor:

    In the three years since liberation, the safety conditions for various construction workers have greatly improved during their work, and the number of casualties has been greatly reduced. Taking Beijing as an example, the number of casualties in 1952 decreased by 90% compared to 1951. However, some leading cadres of construction units still have a serious, purely task-oriented viewpoint and neglect worker safety. Therefore, many work-related injuries that should not have occurred continue to happen. As the motherland is carrying out large-scale capital construction, this issue should attract our serious attention.

    Some units do not pay attention to workers' labor protection conditions and do not fully equip them with the minimum labor protection equipment, which frequently leads to accidents. For example, when workers are working on upper and lower levels, the construction unit does not provide tool bags, which frequently results in lower-level workers being injured by bricks, tiles, hammers, and axes falling from the upper level. Furthermore, when workers come into contact with toxic substances, the construction unit does not provide masks, glasses, and rubber shoes or provides poor-quality protective equipment, making it easy for workers to be poisoned. The Sixth Construction Division of the Central Construction Engineering Ministry's Directly Subordinate Engineering Company has had three consecutive worker poisoning incidents as a result of this, with dozens of workers poisoned. According to materials from the Basic Construction Engineering Company of the Shanxi Provincial Industry Department, the various units under the company had a total of 114 accidents from June to October of last year, of which 50 were due to unsafe equipment, inadequate protection, and negligent inspection.

    Failure to pay attention to safety education for workers is also a reason why accidents frequently occur in some units. Many construction workers are newly arrived from rural areas and lack common sense regarding safe production. Some workers still retain some fatalistic or superstitious ideas and are unwilling to use the safety protection equipment issued by the construction unit. Therefore, strengthening safety education is a very important task. Accidents caused by insufficient safety education are quite alarming in some places and units. According to statistics from the Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company before October of last year, out of 394 accidents in the company, 330 were due to insufficient safety education.

    In addition, the serious bureaucratic work style of some on-site construction personnel has also caused some unnecessary accidents. For example, a certain engineering company in Jiangxi Province was unwilling to buy ropes and insisted on having workers nail scaffolding. Later, the scaffolding collapsed, and two workers were seriously injured. An administrative staff member of a certain engineering company in Hunan Province insisted on having workers carry planks on their shoulders. The workers raised objections, saying that the planks were too heavy and should be carried with ropes, but the staff member firmly refused. As a result, when the workers carrying the planks switched shoulders midway, the planks fell, and a worker was fatally injured.

    It is worth noting that the above-mentioned serious situation has not yet attracted the attention it deserves from the leading cadres of certain construction units, so that the accidents occurring in these units have increased in certain periods. Taking the First Construction Division of the Central Construction Engineering Ministry's Directly Subordinate Engineering Company as an example, the division had five work-related injuries in July of last year, which suddenly increased to 46 in September, and reached as high as 92 in November. This phenomenon is completely unacceptable.

    Facts have proven that work-related accidents in construction units can be greatly reduced and effectively prevented. The problem lies in whether the leading cadres attach importance to labor protection and safety education. For example, before National Day last year, the task at the Tiananmen Square construction site was very urgent, there were many high scaffolding structures, the construction site was small, and the number of workers was large. However, because the leadership attached great importance to safety in production, only three minor injuries occurred during the three-month construction period.

    Based on the above situation, we believe that local construction administrative organs, labor departments, and trade union organizations should pay great attention to the issue of safety in production in construction units. The problems that have already occurred must be dealt with strictly, lessons must be learned from them, and future work must be improved to ensure a reduction in the occurrence of work-related accidents in the motherland's large-scale capital construction efforts.

### 某些建筑单位忽视安全生产经常造成不应有的工伤事故

    某些建筑单位忽视安全生产经常造成不应有的工伤事故
    编辑同志：解放三年多以来，各种建筑工人在工作中的安全条件已经有了很大的改善，伤亡事故大大减少。以北京为例，一九五二年发生的伤亡事故比一九五一年减少了百分之九十。但是，某些施工单位领导干部还有着严重的单纯任务观点，忽视工人安全，因此很多不应发生的伤亡事故仍不断发生。在祖国进行大规模基本建设工作的今天，这个问题应该引起我们的严重注意。
    某些单位不重视工人的劳动保护条件，不把最低限度的劳动保护品设备齐全，因此就经常发生事故。如工人分上下两层作业，施工单位却不给预备工具袋，以致经常发生因上层滑落砖头、瓦块和钉锤、斧头而打伤下层工人的事。再如工人接触有毒物品时，施工单位不发口罩、眼镜和胶鞋等防护用具或者发质量很坏的防护用具，工人就很容易中毒。中央建筑工程部直属工程公司第六施工所曾因此连续发生三次工人中毒事件，中毒工人达数十人。据山西省工业厅基本建设工程公司材料：去年六至十月份该公司所属各单位共发生事故一百一十四起，其中由于设备不安全、防护不周和疏于检查所发生的事故就有五十起。
    不注意对工人进行安全教育，也是某些单位经常发生事故的原因。现在很多建筑工人是刚从农村出来的，缺乏安全生产的常识，有些工人现在还残存着一些命运观念或迷信思想，不肯使用施工单位发下的安全防护用具；因此，加强安全教育就是一个十分重要的工作。由于安全教育不够而发生的事故，在某些地方和某些单位是相当惊人的。据太原市建筑工程公司去年十月以前的统计：在该公司三百九十四件事故中，由于安全教育不够而发生的竟达三百三十件。
    此外，某些现场施工人员的严重官僚主义作风也造成了一些不应有的事故。如江西省某工程公司舍不得买绳子，硬让工人用钉子钉脚手架；后来架子塌下，两个工人摔得重伤。湖南省某工程公司一个事务员硬让工人用肩抬跳板。工人提出意见，说板太重，应用绳子抬；这个事务员坚决不接受。结果抬跳板的工人中途换肩时，跳板脱落，一个工人被砸重伤致死。
    值得注意的是：上述严重情况至今仍然没能引起某些建筑单位领导干部应有的注意，以致这些单位发生的事故在某些时期有增无已。以中央建筑工程部直属工程公司第一施工所为例，该所去年七月份工伤五人，九月份骤增为四十六人，到十一月份竟高达九十二人。这种现象是完全不能允许的。
    事实证明：建筑单位的工伤事故是可以大大减少和有效防止的；问题在于领导干部是否重视劳动保护和安全教育工作。如去年国庆节前天安门工地的任务十分紧急，架子又多又高，施工现场不大，而工人人数却很多，但是因为领导方面十分重视安全生产问题，在三个多月的施工期间仅仅发生了三件轻伤事故。
    根据以上情况，我们认为各地建筑行政机关、劳动部门和工会组织应该十分重视建筑单位的安全生产问题；对已经发生的问题，必须严正处理，从中接受教训，改进今后工作，以保证在祖国大规模基本建设工作中减少工伤事故的发生。李天珉　李成杰
