    Northeast Economic Planning Committee Instructs Relevant Departments
    to Conduct Thorough Preparations for Basic Construction
    to Ensure Full Satisfaction of Needs for Commencement on Schedule
    [By Our Correspondent] The Northeast region has made preliminary achievements in the preparations for basic construction in 1953. The Northeast People's Government Economic Planning Committee recently issued instructions requiring relevant departments in Northeast China to continue to conduct thorough preparations for basic construction in 1953 to ensure full satisfaction of the needs for commencement on schedule.
    Since August 1952, while striving to complete the 1952 basic construction plan, provinces and cities in Northeast China and relevant departments have actively carried out many preparations related to basic construction in 1953. Preliminary achievements have been made in design work. At present, ministries, bureaus, provinces, and cities are further concentrating design forces and establishing specialized design management institutions. Construction organizations have been rectified; design and construction tasks have been preliminarily balanced and allocated. The total number of fixed construction workers in the region has reached 120,000, and winter training has been universally launched. The main materials required for large-scale construction commencement in the region are also basically ready. The total reserves of red bricks, wood, and cement can meet the needs of the first phase of construction commencement and are being successively transported to the sites. The processing and ordering of other equipment and materials have also begun at home and abroad. This provides some favorable conditions for basic construction work in 1953.
    However, the progress of preparatory work in various regions and departments is uneven and not thorough enough. Some construction units, even individual key construction units, have not yet grasped specific construction tasks, and, apart from control indicators, the specific engineering projects and content are unclear. In terms of design, the collection and analysis of survey, design, geological, and hydrological data are generally not thorough enough, and not enough attention has been paid to the problems that have arisen, nor have active measures been taken to solve them. In terms of construction, little has been done to actively expand, cultivate, and train technical forces, and many units still have a dependent mentality of asking from above and finding more engineering departments to contract with. Some units have not yet formulated phased construction plans, on-site construction organizations, and design plans, resulting in the loss of accurate basis for preparatory work. In terms of preparing equipment and materials, many units lack supply and demand plans that closely match the construction progress, only shout that equipment is a problem and no one is undertaking it, without actively putting forward specific requirements and consulting with relevant departments to solve them; serious losses and waste have occurred due to poor planning and improper storage of equipment and materials that have been transported to the sites. For example, a factory in Harbin lost more than 20% of the 22 million red bricks it transported. Based on the above situation, continuing to conduct thorough preparations for basic construction in the first quarter of 1953 remains a very heavy and complex task for all levels of organs in Northeast China, and it is also a key issue in whether the basic construction tasks for this year can be completed.
    To this end, the Northeast People's Government Economic Planning Committee issued the "Instructions on Continuing to Conduct Thorough Preparations for Basic Construction in 1953" on January 5, requiring all units to continue to conduct thorough preparations, and leaders at all levels to closely supervise and inspect, and promptly discover and solve problems existing in the preparatory work, to ensure that the needs for commencement on schedule can be met in terms of quantity, quality, and time in terms of planning, design, construction forces, material preparation and ordering, and organizational leadership.
    The instructions believe that in order to do a good job in preparing for basic construction in 1953, all departments should pay attention to the following tasks:
    1. Grasp the design work and ensure the quality of design. (1) It is necessary to attach importance to the collection and analysis of design data and geological survey and drilling, and quickly and effectively solve the problems existing in them to ensure that the 1953 design meets the actual situation of the site and strive to eliminate errors and rework in the design. (2) It is necessary to concentrate design forces and complete the design of important and complex projects as soon as possible. Provinces and cities should implement the resolutions of the Northeast Design Conference, and try to adopt standard designs or modify existing design drawings as standard designs. (3) It is necessary to strengthen design review and improve the efficiency of review work. (4) For projects requiring foreign design, it is necessary to submit the information required for foreign design as soon as possible to ensure that the design progress closely matches the construction progress.
    2. Actively cultivate technical forces from multiple aspects. All departments and regions must use all methods to adjust, cultivate, and train technical forces, and special attention should be paid to the cultivation of workers with special skills and high technical requirements, as well as technical management cadres such as site directors and construction workers. The winter training work in various places will soon enter the technical education stage, and technical education should be carried out in a planned and focused manner; various places should conduct education on advanced experience operation methods, operation regulations, and responsibility systems, as well as education on quota standards and quality requirements through practical operation, summarizing work, and other methods. Winter training in Northeast China can end political study in mid-January, enter the technical study stage in late January, and basically end at the end of February, in order to prepare for on-site construction. For individual projects that start later or are technically complex, the winter training time can be appropriately extended according to the specific situation.
    3. Quickly determine the phased commencement plan, conduct detailed calculations, formulate a specific supply plan for equipment and materials, and actively carry out material preparation and processing and ordering work. (1) Departments with foreign orders should have dedicated personnel to monitor the ordering and arrival of foreign equipment and materials. (2) Organize the transportation of equipment and materials in a meticulous and rational manner to ensure the needs of the project to commence on schedule. (3) Strengthen and pay attention to the storage of equipment and materials, such as cement storage and wood drying. It is necessary to avoid waste and losses caused by improper transportation and storage.
    In addition, the instructions pointed out that leading organs at all levels in Northeast China should conduct a systematic and in-depth inspection of the preparatory work of their subordinate construction units from top to bottom in the first quarter of 1953. Various inspection methods should be adopted, such as convening reports, sending people to inspect, and conducting surveys and statistics, to combine the upper and lower levels, points and areas. In particular, help them solve problems in a timely manner for their subordinate key construction units and key projects. A universal inspection from bottom to top should also be carried out before the start of construction. Provinces and cities should focus on checking the supply and demand balance and transportation problems of regional labor, bricks, tiles, sand, stone, small hardware, and plumbing equipment, and take effective measures to solve them in a timely manner to ensure that construction can generally start in April. In order to grasp the preparation situation in a timely manner, all departments should also establish a reporting system.

    东北经济计划委员会指示有关部门
    深入进行基本建设准备
    保证充分满足如期开工的需要
    【本报讯】东北区一九五三年基本建设的准备工作已有初步成绩。东北人民政府经济计划委员会最近发布指示，要求东北各有关部门继续深入进行一九五三年基本建设的准备工作，保证充分满足如期开工的需要。
    从一九五二年八月开始，东北各省、市和各有关部门在争取完成一九五二年基本建设计划的同时，积极进行了许多有关一九五三年基本建设的准备工作。设计工作已有初步成绩，目前各部、局和各省、市正在进一步集中设计力量，成立专管设计的机构。施工组织已进行了整顿；设计施工任务已经初步平衡分配。全区固定建筑工人达十二万人，并普遍开始进行冬季训练。全区在大规模施工开始时所需的主要材料也基本上准备就绪。红砖、木材、水泥总的储备数量，可供应第一期开工的需要，现正陆续运往现场。其他器材及设备也已开始在国内外组织加工订货。这对一九五三年的基本建设工作提供了一些有利的条件。
    但是，各地区、各部门的准备工作的进行是不平衡的，而且也不够深入。部分建设单位，甚至个别重点建设单位，到现在还没有掌握具体建设任务，除控制指标以外，具体工程项目及内容都弄不清楚。在设计方面，一般的对于勘察、设计、地质水文资料的搜集和分析还不深入，对于其中发生的问题，还没有十分注意和积极设法解决。在施工方面，对于积极主动地扩大和培养训练技术力量还作得很差，不少单位还有向上要、多找工程部门承包的依赖思想。有些单位到现在还没有订出分期施工计划、现场施工组织及设计计划，以致使准备工作失掉准确依据。在准备设备材料方面，很多单位缺乏与施工进度密切配合的供需计划，只喊设备成问题，无人承担，而不积极提出具体要求与有关部门协商解决；已运到现场的设备材料，由于计划不周、保管不当，已发生严重的损失浪费现象。如哈尔滨某工厂搬运两千二百万块红砖，损失率竟达百分之二十以上。根据以上情况，在一九五三年第一季度内继续深入进行基本建设的准备工作，依然是东北各级机关的一项十分繁重复杂的任务，同时也是能否完成今年基本建设任务的一个关键问题。
    为此，东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会于一月五日发出“关于继续深入进行一九五三年基本建设准备工作的指示”，要求各单位继续深入进行准备，各级领导要抓紧督促检查，及时发现和解决准备工作中存在的问题，以保证从计划、设计、施工力量、备料订货、组织领导等方面，在数量、质量及时间上，都能满足如期开工的需要。
    指示认为，为了做好一九五三年基本建设的准备，各部门应注意进行以下几项工作：
    一、抓紧设计工作，保证设计质量。（1）必须重视设计资料的搜集分析及地质勘察钻探工作，并迅速切实解决其中存在的问题，以保证一九五三年设计切合现场实际情况，争取消灭设计中的错误和返工。（2）必须集中设计力量，尽先完成重要而复杂的工程设计。各省、市应贯彻东北设计会议的各项决议，尽量采用标准设计或修改已有的设计图纸，作为标准设计。（3）必须加强设计审核工作和提高审核工作的效率。（4）需要国外设计的工程，须尽速提出国外设计所需资料，做到设计进度与施工进度密切配合。
    二、积极地从多方面培养技术力量。各部门、各地区必须利用一切方法进行技术力量的调整和培养与训练，尤应特别重视对特种技工和技术要求高的工种的工人，以及工地主任、施工员等技术管理干部的培养。各地冬训工作即将转入技术教育阶段，技术教育应有计划、有重点地进行；各地应通过实际操作、总结工作等方法，进行先进经验操作方法、操作规程、责任制的教育，并进行关于定额标准与质量要求的教育。东北各地冬训工作可在一月中旬结束政治学习，一月下旬开始进入技术学习阶段，并于二月末基本结束，以便进行现场施工的准备工作。个别开工较晚或技术复杂的工程，冬训时间可根据具体情况适当延长。
    三、迅速确定分期开工计划，进行详细计算，拟出设备器材的具体供应计划，积极进行备料和加工订货工作。（1）有国外订货的部门，要有专人掌握国外设备器材订货和到货情况。（2）周密合理地组织设备材料的运输工作，保证工程如期开工的需要。（3）加强与注意器材的保管工作，如水泥贮存，木材干燥等。必须避免由于运输保管不善而造成的浪费和损失。
    此外，指示指出：东北各级领导机关应在一九五三年第一季度内，对所属建设单位的准备工作，自上而下地进行系统的深入的检查。并应采取多种检查方式，如召集汇报，派人检查，调查统计等，以作到上下点面结合。特别是对所属重点建设单位及重点工程，应及时帮助他们解决问题。在开工前并应进行一次普遍的自下而上的检查。各省、市并应着重检查地区劳动力、砖、瓦、砂、石、小五金、水暖器材的供需平衡及运输中存在的问题，及时采取有效措施予以解决，以保证在四月份内能普遍开工。为了及时掌握准备情况，各部门并应建立汇报制度。
