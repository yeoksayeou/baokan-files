    Making Friends with Volunteer Army Comrades
    Chang Rong
    This year during the New Year, Zhang Chunfeng, a Young Pioneer from the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School, meticulously made a colorful New Year's card. She drew four peace doves in the four corners, pasted her own photo in the middle, and wrote these enthusiastic words: "Volunteer Army Uncles guarding Shangganling, please remember me, a fourteen-year-old girl wearing a red scarf, embracing you from afar, kissing you. Uncles, a thousand words cannot express my love for you!"
    Zhang Chunfeng carefully put this New Year's card into a comfort bag, along with the Soviet famous novel "Days and Nights" given to the Volunteer Army by her classmates, several copies of "People's Songs," a "Good Student" medal, and stationery, envelopes, and soap... This comfort bag, along with 78 similar comfort bags and more than 1,900 letters of appreciation made by all the students in the school before the New Year, were all sent to the Korean front.
    The letters of appreciation written by the students of the Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School to the Volunteer Army have one characteristic: most of these letters are addressed to specific units or comrades of the Volunteer Army, because they have established a close friendship with more than 460 units and individuals of the Volunteer Army, frequently corresponding with each other, and mutually reporting on combat and study situations. More than ten thousand letters have been exchanged.
    Among the Volunteer Army friends with whom they frequently correspond is the nationally famous Volunteer Army Yang Lian Di Hero Company. Before his martyrdom, Yang Lian Di frequently corresponded with the students of the Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School, encouraging them to study hard and prepare to contribute to the country in the future. The students also frequently wrote letters to comfort and encourage Comrade Yang Lian Di, expressing their intention to learn from him. In May 1952, when the news of Yang Lian Di's glorious sacrifice reached the school, many students cried. But they quickly wiped away their tears, transformed grief into strength, and continued to write letters to the comrades of the Yang Lian Di Company, expressing to the martyr's comrades: We will always remember Comrade Yang Lian Di's words and continue to move forward. At the same time, many students wrote letters to comfort the family of Martyr Yang Lian Di and sent their own photos. Zhu Zunying wrote in her letter: "One hero has fallen, but thousands of heroes have stood up." To comfort the martyr's family, she wrote: "I would like to be a member of your family, but I don't know what to call you..." Upon receiving the students' letters, Yang Yu Pu, Yang Lian Di's father, replied: "On the front wall of my house, there are many photos sent by you. Although I have never seen you, I understand your feelings. Zhu Zunying wrote in her letter, wishing to be a member of my family, and asked if I would like that. Why wouldn't I! The letter asked me what to call me, I think calling me Uncle is fine. Because there is not only one child like Yang Lian Di in the country, and there is not only one father like me in the country. Chairman Mao has already led us to become one family, our hearts are one..."
    "Our hearts are one!" The students will always remember this sentence. On the eve of the New Year, they made many New Year's cards and sent them to the home of Martyr Yang Lian Di. Zhu Zunying also used the money her brother sent to buy something for her grandmother to buy some gifts for Yang Lian Di's father and children. Several students are planning to visit Grandpa Yang Yu Pu during the winter vacation.
    The comrades of the Yang Lian Di Company also frequently remember them. In November 1952, they entrusted the Second Delegation to Korea to bring back two precious gifts for them. One was a silk banner made of captured American parachutes, which was given to all the students of the school. It read: "Study diligently, and dedicate yourselves to the motherland." The other was an aluminum triangle ruler. This was given to Young Pioneer Zhu Zunying by soldier Jin Fugui. Jin Fugui wrote in his letter:
    "One day, we went to repair the line, and the American aerial bandits came again. After circling in the air a few times, our anti-aircraft machine guns shot them down. I ran to pick up a piece of aluminum and made a triangle ruler for you as a souvenir."
    The students were moved by these two precious gifts. They said, "This was exchanged with blood, we must cherish the comrades' blood." They discussed and enriched their study plans. Zhu Zunying had never liked science since she was a child, and her grades were not good in every exam. This time, she was determined to study science well. She said, "In my future studies, I must live up to this triangle ruler!"
    Almost every letter from a Volunteer Army comrade vividly reported their combat and life situation, and instructed them: Study hard and prepare to take on the great construction tasks of the motherland. The students wrote these words in their diaries or pencil cases as a force to constantly encourage themselves to move forward. Young Pioneer Feng Yaoping said, "When we encounter difficulties, we feel as if Yang Lian Di, Guo Zhongtian, and Zhang Jihui are standing in front of us, and we immediately gain strength." Her ambition is to become an air force soldier in the future. To make herself brave, she and her classmates organized the "Zoya Reconnaissance Team" and went on trips to the suburbs with compasses on cold nights. Li Tongren's algebra grades were not good last semester, and she did not receive the Good Student Medal, so she felt that she could no longer write to her Volunteer Army friends. This semester, she studied hard, and in the two unit tests, she got full marks in algebra. Young Pioneer Li Ning used to have poor science grades. Once, she received a letter from Ma Zhesheng from a Volunteer Army unit. The letter wrote: "Recently, I went to a village to perform a task and saw a Korean female student washing tree bark, her hands were frozen red. I knew this was her dinner. At that time, I thought, if the United States hadn't launched the war, wouldn't this girl be the same as Li Ning? How can we allow the children of our country to suffer the same fate as this Korean girl?..." This letter moved Li Ning, and she studied even harder. Now, her science scores have all reached over ninety.
    Frequently writing letters to comfort the Volunteer Army, learning from the Volunteer Army, and making friends with the Volunteer Army have become an indispensable part of many students' lives. They all like to tell the Volunteer Army about their study, life, and thoughts, and give them their most beloved things. Young Pioneer Mi Ning said, "Every Sunday, I naturally think about writing to the Volunteer Army. Writing a letter is like checking my own study, thoughts, and work, because the Volunteer Army is most concerned about these." As soon as they received the Good Student Medal, they quickly sent it to their Volunteer Army friends; some students joined the Party or the League, and immediately wrote to tell the Volunteer Army, and some even sent photos of when they joined the Party or the League. Young Pioneer Gao Xiumin and others wrote in a recent letter to a Volunteer Army unit: "We are actively preparing precious gifts for you. But, we will never let you wait too long..." This precious gift is their group photo when they joined the Party!
    These cordial and enthusiastic letters and photos,慰问items, etc. from the students, after being sent to the Korean front, also inspired the combat enthusiasm of the Volunteer Army. The Third Company of the First Battalion of a certain Volunteer Army unit, when they received the letter of appreciation, red scarf, and Good Student Medal from the Second Detachment of the Third Brigade of the Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School Young Pioneer Team, coincided with their victory in a counterattack battle. That night, they held a conference in the tunnel. It was decided to use the received red scarf and Good Student Medal as rewards in the next battle, awarding them to those who had made special contributions in the battle, and to snipers who hit the target every time. At the meeting, the soldiers shouted: "Kill more enemies and strive for the red scarf and Good Student Medal!" Each class and platoon added this to their meritorious service plan. The anti-aircraft artillery company of a certain Volunteer Army unit responded to the Young Pioneer First Group of the Senior Three Class of the Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School with the combat record of damaging and shooting down 25 enemy planes. The Junior Three Class Two received a letter from Yang Hao, a comrade from the company of their Volunteer Army friend Wang Jingye, in November 1952. The letter wrote:
    "Dear students, the last letter you gave to Comrade Wang Jingye has been received. However, he has shed the last drop of blood for the people of the motherland and cannot write to you personally anymore.
    "In a recent battle, our company was tasked with attacking the enemy's self-proclaimed 'steel position.' Comrade Wang Jingye stuffed two explosive packs into his waist and said to me: 'This time I will use practical actions to respond to the children's hopes!' In the fierce artillery fire, we launched a fierce attack on the enemy. In just twenty minutes, we took the 'steel position.' The dying enemy tried to recapture the position, and launched counterattacks on us in succession. A shell landed next to Comrade Wang Jingye, and his leg was blown off. However, he struggled to get up, picked up the grenade next to him, and threw it at the incoming enemy, repelling several enemy attacks in succession. But when he threw the last grenade, he finally couldn't stand up anymore due to excessive exertion and blood loss. He sacrificed like this. Before he died, he shouted loudly: 'Beloved motherland, respected Chairman Mao, dear students, although my leg has been broken, I will use my own blood to defend the position, I will never take a step back for you!'"

    和志愿军同志做朋友
    长荣
    今年过年的时候，北京师范大学附属女子中学的少年儿童队员张春凤，精心地做了一张彩色的贺年片，四角画着四只和平鸽子，中间贴着自己的照片并写着这样热情的话：“守卫在上甘岭的志愿军叔叔们，请记住我，一个十四岁的围着红领巾的女孩子，在千里之外拥抱你，亲吻你。叔叔啊，千言万语说不尽我热爱你的心！”
    张春凤小心地把这张贺年片装进一个慰问袋里，还装上她们班上的同学们送给志愿军的苏联著名小说“日日夜夜”、几本“人民歌声”、一个学习优良奖章、还有信纸、信封、肥皂……。这个慰问袋，连同她们全校同学在新年前赶做的这样的慰问袋七十八个和一千九百多封慰问信，都寄到朝鲜前线去了。
    师大女附中同学们写给志愿军的慰问信有一个特点，这些信的大部分是写明了寄给志愿军的那个单位或那个同志的，因为她们已经和志愿军的四百六十多个单位和个人建立了亲切的友谊，彼此经常通信，互相报告战斗和学习的情况。来往的信件已经有一万封以上了。
    在和她们经常通信的志愿军朋友中，有为全国闻名的志愿军杨连第英雄连。杨连第烈士生前，就经常和师大女附中的同学们通信，勉励她们好好学习，准备将来为祖国贡献力量；同学们也经常写信去慰问和鼓励杨连第同志，并表示向他学习。一九五二年五月，杨连第烈士光荣牺牲的消息传到学校，许多同学都哭了。但她们很快就揩干眼泪，化悲愤为力量，并且不断地给杨连第连的同志们写信，向烈士的战友们表示：我们永远记住杨连第烈士的话，继续前进。同时，许多同学写信去慰问杨连第烈士的家属，并寄去自己的照片。朱尊英同学的信上写道：“一个英雄倒下去了，但千万个英雄站了起来。”为了安慰烈属，她写道：“我愿意做为你家中的一个人，可是不知道应该叫什么。……”接到了同学们的信，杨连第的父亲杨玉璞回信说：“我的房子的正墙上，贴着不少你们寄来的照片。我虽然没有看到过你们，但你们的心情我全都明白。朱尊英来信说，愿做为我家的一个人，还问我愿意不愿意。我为啥不愿意！信中问我称呼什么好，我想一样地称呼伯伯就很好。因为像杨连第这样的孩子全国不只一个，像我这样的父亲全国也不只一个。毛主席已经领导我们成为一家人了，我们的心只有一条……”
    “我们的心只有一条！”同学们永远记着这句话。新年前夕，她们做了许多贺年片寄到杨连第烈士的家里。朱尊英还把哥哥寄来给奶奶买东西的钱，买了一些礼物送给杨连第的父亲和孩子。好几个同学都准备在寒假去看看杨玉璞老伯伯。
    杨连第连的同志们也经常记着她们。一九五二年十一月，他们托第二届赴朝慰问团给她们带回来了两件珍贵礼品，一件是一面用缴获的美国降落伞做成的锦旗，是送给全校同学的。上面写着：“勤于学习，将献身于祖国”。另一件是一块铝制的三角板。这是战士金富贵送给青年团员朱尊英的。金富贵在信上写着：
    “一天，我们去抢修线路，美国空中强盗又来了。在空中盘旋不到几圈，就叫咱们的高射机枪给揍下来。我跑去拣了块铝片，做了个三角板送给你做为纪念吧。”
    同学们为这两件珍贵礼品所感动。她们说：“这是用鲜血换来的，我们要珍惜同志们的鲜血。”她们讨论、充实了自己的学习计划。朱尊英从小就不喜欢理科，每次考试成绩都不好。这次，她下决心把理科学好。她说：“我在今后的学习中，一定要对得起这块三角板！”
    每一个志愿军同志的来信，差不多都是生动地报告了自己的战斗、生活情况，并嘱咐她们：要好好学习，准备担当起祖国的伟大建设任务。同学们都把这些话写在自己的日记本或文具盒里，做为不断鼓舞自己前进的力量。青年团员冯姚平说：“我们遇到了困难，就觉得好像杨连第、郭忠田、张积慧站在自己跟前似的，劲头马上就来了。”她的志愿是将来当一个空军战士。为了使自己勇敢起来，她和同学们一块组织了“卓娅侦察小组”，在严寒的夜晚，带着指南针到郊外去旅行。李同仁在上学期代数成绩不好，没有得到学习优良奖章，就觉得没有办法再给自己的志愿军朋友写信了。这学期她努力学习，在两次单元考试中，代数都得到满分。青年团员李宁过去理科成绩不好。有一次，她接到了志愿军某部马哲生的来信。信上写着：“最近我到一个村子里去执行任务，看到一个朝鲜女学生在洗树皮，两手冻得通红。我知道这是她的晚餐。当时我想，要不是美国发动战争，这个女孩子不是也和李宁一样吗？我们怎能允许祖国的孩子遭到这个朝鲜女孩子一样的命运呢？……”这封信感动了李宁，她学习得更有劲了。现在，她的理科各门功课成绩都达到了九十分以上。
    经常写信慰问志愿军，向志愿军学习，和志愿军做朋友，已经成了许多同学生活中不可缺少的一项。她们都喜欢把自己的学习、生活和思想情况告诉志愿军，把自己最心爱的东西送给他们。青年团员米宁说：“每到礼拜日，就很自然地想起来和志愿军写信。写一次信，就等于检查一次自己的学习、思想和工作，因为志愿军最关心我们的是这些。”她们一得到了学习优良奖章，就很快寄给自己的志愿军朋友；有的同学入了党、入了团，也马上写信告诉志愿军，有的还把入党入团时的照片寄去。青年团员高秀民等，在最近给志愿军某部的一封信上写着：“我们正在积极筹备送给你们的珍贵礼品。但，绝不会让你们等得太久……”这一珍贵礼品，就是她们入党时的合影啊！
    同学们的这些亲切的、热情的信件和照片、慰问物品等，寄到朝鲜前线以后，也同样地鼓舞了志愿军的战斗热情。志愿军某部一营三连，在接到师大女附中少年儿童队三大队二中队的慰问信、红领巾和学习优良奖章时，正碰上他们在一次反击战斗的胜利之后。当晚，他们就在坑道中举行了大会。决定把收到的红领巾和学习优良奖章当做下次战斗中的奖励品，奖给在战斗中有特殊功勋的人，奖给百发百中的狙击手。会上，战士们高呼：“多杀敌人，争取红领巾和学习优良奖章！”各班、排都在立功计划中加上了这一条。志愿军某部高射炮连则以击伤、击落敌机二十五架的战绩，回答了师大女附中高三一班青年团第一小组的团员们。初三二班，于一九五二年十一月接到了一封她们的志愿军朋友王敬业所在连队的杨浩同志的来信。信上写着：
    “亲爱的同学们，你们给王敬业同志的最后一封信，已经收到了。可是，他已经为祖国人民流尽了最后的一滴血，不能够再给你们亲自写信了。 “在最近的一次战斗中，我连担负了攻打敌人自夸为‘钢铁阵地’的任务。王敬业同志把两个爆破筒塞在腰里，对我说：‘这回我要用实际行动来回答孩子们的希望！’在激烈的炮火声中，我们向敌人发起了猛攻。只二十分钟，我们就拿下了这座‘钢铁阵地’。垂死的敌人，妄图重新夺回阵地，连续向我们发起了反扑。一颗炮弹落在王敬业同志的身旁，他的腿被炸断了。但是，他又挣扎起来，拿起身旁的手榴弹就向着扑来的敌人摔去，连续打退了敌人的好几次进攻。但当他扔出最后的一颗手榴弹时，终因用力过猛，流血过多，再也没有站起来。他，就这样地牺牲了。临死前，他还高声喊着：‘可爱的祖国，敬爱的毛主席，亲爱的同学们，我的腿虽然被打断了，但是我要用自己的鲜血守住阵地，为了你们我决不后退一步！’”
