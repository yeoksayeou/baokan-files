Chinese films have been screened in over fifty countries in the past three years, receiving enthusiastic welcome from people and overseas Chinese in various countries.

The first to welcome Chinese films were the broad working people of the Soviet Union. From August 1950 to April 1951, films such as "Daughters of China," "Boundless Radiance," "The Invisible Front," "The Victory of the Chinese People," and "Liberated China" were successively screened in various parts of the Soviet Union, with an audience of 20 million people. From October 1, 1951, the Soviet Union also held a ten-day "Chinese Film Festival" in the capitals of sixteen union republics and other major cities. During this period, the audience in Moscow alone reached more than one million people. Later, cinemas throughout the Soviet Union and cultural palaces in major factories regularly screened Chinese films translated into Russian.

Audiences in various People's Democratic countries also welcomed Chinese films with great interest. Hungary and Romania both held "Chinese Film Weeks" in 1951. When "Daughters of China" was screened in Pyongyang in July 1950, it attracted 38,000 viewers in four days. Major newspapers in Pyongyang published special articles about it. From 1950, Chinese films that won awards at several "International Film Festivals" held in Czechoslovakia included "Daughters of China," "Millions of Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "Steel Warrior," "The White Haired Girl," "The People's Warrior," and "Resist America, Aid Korea."

Overseas Chinese watch every film from their motherland with boundless love for their country. When "The Birth of New China" was screened in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, many overseas Chinese living more than 100 kilometers away also rushed to watch it. When "Daughters of China" and "Zhao Yiman" were screened in Southeast Asia, they caused a surge of enthusiastic viewing among overseas Chinese. Many elderly overseas Chinese in India were moved after watching films such as "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" and expressed that they only now felt the glory of being a Chinese person.

When Chinese films were screened in various capitalist countries, they also gave great encouragement to progressive audiences. They saw in the films the Chinese people's will to defend peace and the Chinese people's path and achievements of struggle. "The Victory of the Chinese People" was screened at the Seventh National Congress of the Italian Communist Party. After watching "The White Haired Girl," the Japanese people associated the film with the suffering of the Japanese people currently oppressed by American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary regime, thus increasing their courage to struggle and their confidence in victory. Many representatives of the people from various capitalist countries who came to China to participate in various international conferences requested to take some Chinese films back to their countries to conduct propaganda and education among their people.

By the end of 1952, the countries that had screened Chinese films included fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Albania, North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, as well as more than forty other countries including Indonesia, Burma, India, Pakistan, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Australia, Ceylon, the United States, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, Iran, Turkey, Chile, Brazil, Israel, Mexico, Iceland, and Colombia.

The films screened in these countries included thirty feature films such as "The Bridge," "Daughters of China," "Zhao Yiman," and "Steel Warrior," twenty-six documentaries such as "Millions of Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "The Victory of the Chinese People," and "The Army Liberates Tibet," and nineteen medium and small documentaries. Nearly seven hundred copies were exported, many of which were translated, dubbed, and subtitled in various countries for mass reproduction.

    五十多个国家放映了我国影片
    三年来我国人民电影影片已在五十多个国家上映，受到各国人民和华侨的热烈欢迎。
    首先欢迎我国影片的，是苏联的广大劳动人民。从一九五○年八月到一九五一年四月，苏联各地曾陆续上映“中华女儿”、“光芒万丈”、“无形的战线”、“中国人民的胜利”、“解放了的中国”等影片，观众达两千万人。一九五一年十月一日起，苏联又在十六个加盟共和国的首都和其他各大城市举行了为期十天的“中国电影节”。在此期间，仅莫斯科一地的观众就达一百多万人。以后苏联各地的影院和各大工厂的文化宫都经常上映译成俄语的中国影片。
    各人民民主国家的观众也以极大的兴趣欢迎我国影片。匈牙利和罗马尼亚都在一九五一年举行过“中国电影周”。一九五○年七月，“中华女儿”在平壤上映时，四天即有三万八千观众。平壤各大报都为此发表专文。从一九五○年起，我国影片在捷克斯洛伐克举行的几届“国际电影节”上获奖的有“中华女儿”、“百万雄师下江南”、“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“人民的战士”、“抗美援朝”等。
    海外华侨怀着对祖国无限的热爱来看祖国每一部影片。“新中国的诞生”在印度尼西亚首都雅加达上映时，许多住在一百多公里以外的华侨也赶去观看了。“中华女儿”、“赵一曼”在南洋上映时，都在华侨中引起一种争相观看的热潮。许多在印度的老年华侨在看了“中国民族大团结”等影片后，都感动地表示：只有现在才感到作一个中国人民的光荣。
    我国影片在各资本主义国家上映时，也给了进步观众以莫大的鼓舞。他们在影片中看到了中国人民保卫和平的意志，看到中国人民斗争的道路和斗争的成果。“中国人民的胜利”曾在意大利共产党第七次全国代表大会中上映。日本人民看了“白毛女”之后，把影片和日本人民目前受美帝国主义和日本反动政权压迫的苦难联系起来，因而增加了他们斗争的勇气和胜利的信心。许多来我国参加各种国际性会议的各资本主义国家人民的代表，返国时都要求带些中国影片回去，向本国人民进行宣传教育。
    到一九五二年年底，先后放映过我国影片的国家，除苏联、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、蒙古、越南等兄弟国家外，还有印尼、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、瑞典、丹麦、芬兰、瑞士、英国、法国、奥地利、澳大利亚、锡兰、美国、意大利、日本、菲律宾、伊朗、土耳其、智利、巴西、以色列、墨西哥、冰岛、哥伦比亚等四十多个国家。
    在这些国家上映的影片，计有故事片“桥”、“中华女儿”、“赵一曼”、“钢铁战士”等三十部，记录片“百万雄师下江南”、“中国人民的胜利”、“解放西藏大军行”等二十六部，中小记录片十九部。输出拷贝近七百部，其中有很多拷贝经各国翻译配音和加印字幕后大量复制。
