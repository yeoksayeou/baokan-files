    Do not dump coal ash in shallow waterways and port areas of the Yangtze River
    To the Editor: The Yangtze River is a major artery of our motherland. Especially today, as the motherland is launching large-scale economic construction, the Yangtze River will have even greater value in transportation. In order to utilize the Yangtze River more effectively, we will have to do a lot of dredging work in the future. However, large and small ships sailing on the river have often dumped burnt coal ash into the river. This is very bad. Especially in shallow waterways and port areas, the accumulation of coal ash over the years will undoubtedly raise the riverbed year by year, increasing the difficulty of shipping traffic. Therefore, I suggest that the dumping of coal ash into the river should be prohibited. This coal ash can be transported to land when ships are docked, and can also be used to pave roads and dry the ground, which is also useful.  Li Xiaohai

    不要在长江的浅水航道和港区以内倾倒煤灰
    编辑同志：长江是祖国的一条大动脉。特别是祖国展开大规模经济建设的今天，长江在交通运输上将有更大的价值。为了更有效地利用长江，我们今后要做很多的疏浚工作。但是，历年来在江上行驶的大小轮船，却经常把烧下的煤灰倒在江里。这是很不好的。尤其在浅水航道和港区内，积年累月地倾倒煤灰，无疑地将使河床逐年淤高，增加航运交通的困难。因此，我建议应该禁止往江内倾倒煤灰。而这些煤灰在船只靠岸时运上陆地，还可以铺垫道路、干燥地面，也是有用处的。  李孝海
