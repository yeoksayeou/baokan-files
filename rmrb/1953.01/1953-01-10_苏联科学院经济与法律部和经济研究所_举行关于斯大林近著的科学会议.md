Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: A scientific conference on Stalin's recent work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" held by the Department of Economics and Law and the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, opened in Moscow on the 7th. The presidium of the conference consisted of Alexander N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Alexander Topchiev, Secretary of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, S.G. Strumilin, Academician of the Academy of Sciences, and others. Nearly one thousand people attended the conference, including famous economists from Moscow and Leningrad, as well as representatives from the Academies of Sciences of the various Union Republics and famous institutions of higher education.

The conference was opened by Konstantin V. Ostrovityanov, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Director of the Institute of Economics. He pointed out that Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. It is a significant milestone in the development of Soviet economic science and opens up vast prospects for scientific activities. Soviet scientists should write works based on Comrade Stalin's theories on the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned development of the national economy, and should pay special attention to studying the socialist construction problems of people's democratic countries and the unprecedented new economic relations between socialist and democratic camp countries. Ostrovityanov pointed out that we must publish a large number of textbooks and popular readings to help the broad masses of workers and collective farmers understand the economic laws of socialism and apply these laws in communist construction. He emphasized that economists have a major task in studying the disintegration of the unified world market and the deepening crisis of the world capitalist system.

At the first meeting, attendees listened to Fei. Samokhvalov's report "Stalin's Work is a New Stage in the Development of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy" and Academician Vasily Nemchinov's report "Stalin on the Economic Law that Relations of Production Must Suit the Nature of the Productive Forces."

    苏联科学院经济与法律部和经济研究所
    举行关于斯大林近著的科学会议
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院经济与法律部和经济研究所关于斯大林近著“苏联社会主义经济问题”的科学会议，已于七日在莫斯科揭幕。会议主席团由苏联科学院院长亚历山大·纳·涅斯米扬诺夫、科学院主席团秘书阿历山大·托普切夫、科学院院士斯·格·斯特鲁米林及其他等人组成。参加会议的有莫斯科和列宁格勒的著名经济学家以及各加盟共和国科学院和著名高等教育机关的代表，将近一千人。
    会议由苏联科学院通讯院士、经济研究所所长康斯坦丁·维·奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫主持开幕。他指出：斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，是对马克思列宁主义宝库的伟大的贡献。它在苏联经济科学的发展中是一个意义重大的界标，为科学活动开辟了广大前途。苏联科学家们要根据斯大林同志关于社会主义基本经济法则、国民经济有计划发展法则的学说撰写著作，并要特别注意研究人民民主国家的社会主义建设问题以及社会主义与民主阵营各国间空前的新的经济关系问题。奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫指出：我们必须出版大批教科书和通俗读物，协助广大的工人和集体农民群众理解社会主义经济法则，并且在共产主义建设中运用这些法则。他强调说：经济学家们在研究关于统一的世界市场的瓦解与世界资本主义体系危机加深的问题方面有着重大的任务。
    在第一次会议上，到会者听取了费·萨摩赫瓦洛夫的报告“斯大林的著作是马克思列宁主义政治经济学发展中的一个新阶段”和瓦西里·涅姆钦诺夫院士的报告“斯大林论生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的经济法则”。
    科学会议将举行三天，讨论十三篇科学论文。
