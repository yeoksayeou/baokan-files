Some Basic Construction Units in Beijing and Guihua
Randomly Recruit Construction Workers, Causing Serious Chaos

[This newspaper reports] Some basic construction units in Beijing, proceeding from their own departmental interests, have been competing for construction workers everywhere by means of raising welfare benefits and increasing wages. This has caused chaos in the flow of workers and disrupted the state's plan for fixed workers.

Bi, the section chief of the Basic Construction Section of Factory 45333 of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government, once publicized to the workers of the 5235 work area of the Beijing Construction Company that those who worked at the factory would receive the highest wages in Beijing (currently, the daily wage of a technician at the factory is 25,300 yuan, which is about 2,000 yuan higher than that of the same level of worker at the Beijing Construction Company). He also promoted the factory's high welfare benefits, saying that if they came to work at the factory, everyone would have a dormitory (those who did not live in the dormitory would receive a monthly housing subsidy of 90,000 yuan), a bunk board, a stove, a table, and two chairs, as well as 1.5 tons of coal. Using this method, the factory lured about 100 workers from the Beijing Construction Company to the factory. When the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau sent people to the factory to investigate this issue, Section Chief Bi actually gathered these workers for a meeting and said to them: "Now the Labor Bureau wants you to return to the Beijing Construction Company. Are you willing?" After the workers expressed their unwillingness to return, Section Chief Bi said to the cadres sent by the Labor Bureau: "The workers are willing to come here, so we have to keep them; if the workers want to return to their original units, we have no objection." Under his influence, some workers ran to the cadres sent by the Labor Bureau and made a big fuss, expressing their determination not to return.

In order to recruit more workers, Factory 45333 of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government and the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company and other units also sent people to Tianqiao in Beijing on Sundays to publicize to the workers of the Beijing Construction Company. Gao Xiufeng, a cadre of the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company, even said to the workers: "Come on, everyone can be registered as a long-term worker in our company." Qiu Jingshan, a material clerk of Factory 45333 of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government, also said to worker Jia Zhenming: "Come to our place, and we will give you 30,000 yuan a day." In early November of last year, the Beijing Shijingshan Construction Company sent people to Baoding City, Hebei Province, to recruit workers. Without the consent of the Baoding Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, they privately approached long-term workers of the Hebei Provincial Construction Company. The highest daily wage for construction workers in Baoding City was 20,000 yuan. The cadres of the Shijingshan Construction Company told the workers: "As long as you can use a trowel, you will get 25,000 yuan in Beijing, and the round-trip expenses will be borne by our company." In this way, they lured away all the more than 50 long-term workers of the Third Team of the Hebei Provincial Construction Company.

In order to recruit more workers, the Electricity Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central Government excessively stipulated four major welfare benefits: housing for workers' families would be provided; in addition to wages, each person would receive a site allowance of up to 6,000 yuan per day; a family subsidy of 13% would be issued each month; and a coal and fire allowance of 130,000 yuan would be issued to each person in winter. The basic construction office of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the temporary construction office of the Central Ministry of Railways and other units also offered excessively high welfare benefits when recruiting workers. These units, relying on excessively high welfare benefits, lured away construction workers from other units. The temporary construction office of the Central Ministry of Railways lured away eight long-term workers, Yan Shufang and Song Ying, and basic workers Yang Zhitong, Xiao Jianze, and Li Fuhai, etc., from the directly subordinate engineering company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, and has not yet returned these workers to the directly subordinate engineering company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering. The civil construction company of the Electricity Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central Government lured away twelve workers from the directly subordinate engineering company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, and also recruited some workers from Shanghai by lowering technical standards (promoting first-level workers to second-level workers). The basic construction office of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry lured away eight workers, Zhuang Younian and Zhang Zhipeng, etc., from the Beijing Construction Company. The engineering team of the Central Ministry of Public Security also lured away more than 30 workers from the Beijing Construction Company. The treatment was: a daily wage of 25,000 yuan; after one week of study, one month's salary would be paid, and they would be given a vacation to go home. After they returned, vacation pay would also be supplemented.

Because these units arbitrarily increased wages and welfare benefits in such a wrong way, many construction workers in Beijing were unwilling to work in their original units and jumped factories one after another, disrupting Beijing's plan for training workers and fixing workers. The Beijing Construction Company received five or six letters of resignation from long-term workers every day, and received as many as twenty letters of resignation on one day. The work of the company's fixed workers has been seriously affected. Many workers said, "We won't work without high wages!" Dozens of workers in the company's Fifth Engineering Department asked for wage increases every day. Just two days after the winter training of workers began in the company's Fourth Engineering Department, 31 long-term workers requested to resign and go to work in other units. Worker Cui Shufa said: "I am only willing to stay if the wages are increased." Some workers whose resignations were not approved said: "We are not allowed to leave now. If wages are not increased in the future, we will still leave." When the company's First Engineering Department gave a major lesson to the workers on December 22 last year, the workers were not at ease listening to the lesson and handed notes to the rostrum one after another, requesting more wages, requesting resignation, and requesting leave. The Beijing Construction Company originally decided to train 10,000 workers in winter, but because workers are mobile and not at ease at work, training has not yet fully begun. Due to the sudden departure of some workers from the site of some basic construction units, the emotions of other workers also fluctuated, affecting the work. Because more than 30 workers from the construction engineering office of the Beijing Institute of Technology transferred to the Guihua Municipal People's Construction Company in Suiyuan City, other workers were not at ease at work, and work efficiency suddenly dropped. In the past, the engineering office plastered eight square meters per worker per day, but now it can only plaster six square meters per day. More than 40 plasterers plastered more than 900 square meters less in half a month, forcing the project to postpone its completion date.

[Another News Item] The Guihua Municipal People's Construction Company in Suiyuan Province randomly recruited construction workers, affecting agricultural production work. On August 26 last year, the company sent Song Chaoqing and Lv Zhenkai to Qingxian County and Jianguo County in Hebei Province to recruit construction workers. Song and Lv openly set up construction worker recruitment stations at Qingxian County Railway Station. Through the personal relationships of Ji Genfeng, Ji Genyuan, Pan Guangpu, and Huang Ziqing, they mobilized construction workers from all over to go to Suiyuan, claiming: "Suiyuan Province has high wages, there is work to do, and transportation is taken care of." Ji Genfeng also planned to recruit all the employed construction workers in Yangliuqing to work in Suiyuan. Pan Guangpu also prepared to send out invitations, inviting construction workers from various villages. Some local farmers, hearing that Suiyuan Province was recruiting workers at Qingxian County Railway Station, even left the autumn harvest mutual aid teams they had organized and signed up to work in Suiyuan. Some farmers traveled from 70 to 80 miles away to Qingxian County Railway Station to sign up, affecting agricultural production work. The company originally stipulated that more than 390 workers would be recruited before September 3 last year, but they did not stop recruiting in time. By now, the number of registered applicants has reached 627. When the registered workers had already set off for Suiyuan, the company said: "Our company has recruited enough workers, and those recruited will be sent home." This caused great dissatisfaction among the workers. Some workers had already traveled to Beijing and were preparing to transfer to Suiyuan, but the company asked them to go home and issued them travel expenses. After receiving the travel expenses, some workers ran around, looking for jobs in Beijing, affecting labor employment work and social order in Beijing.

    北京、归绥部分基本建设单位
    乱拉建筑工人造成严重混乱现象
    【本报讯】北京市部分基本建设单位从本位利益出发，竟以提高福利待遇、增高工资的方法，到处争夺建筑工人，造成了工人流动的混乱现象，打乱了国家固定工人的计划。
    中央第二机械工业部四五三三三厂基本建设科毕科长曾经在北京市建筑公司五二三五工区，向工人宣传：到该厂工作的，将得到全北京最高的工资（现在该厂技工每日工资二万五千三百元，比北京市建筑公司的同级工人高两千元左右）。他并且宣传该厂的福利待遇高，如果到该厂工作，每个人有宿舍（不住宿的，每月补助房租九万元），有一付铺板，一个火炉，一张桌子，两把椅子，还有一吨半煤。该厂就利用这种办法，把北京市建筑公司一百名左右的工人，拉到该厂去。当北京市人民政府劳动局派人到该厂调查这个问题时，毕科长居然召集这些工人开会，向工人说：“现在劳动局要你们回到北京市建筑公司去，你们愿意不愿意？”工人表示不愿回去后，毕科长遂向劳动局派来的干部说：“工人愿意到我们这里来，我们只好留下；如果工人要回到原单位去，我们没意见。”在他的影响下，有些工人就跑来向劳动局派来的干部大吵大闹，表示决不回去。
    中央第二机械工业部四五三三三厂及华北基本建设工程公司等单位为了多招收工人，在星期天，还专门派人到北京天桥，向北京市建筑公司工人宣传。华北基本建设工程公司干部高秀峰竟然向工人说：“你们来吧，到我们公司都能登记为长期工人。”中央第二机械工业部四五三三三厂材料员邱景山也向工人贾振明说：“你到我们那儿去吧，每天给你三万元。”去年十一月上旬，北京石景山建筑公司派人到河北省保定市招收工人。他们未经保定市人民政府劳动局同意，就私自到河北省建筑公司的长期工人中活动。保定市建筑工人每日最高工资是两万元，石景山建筑公司的干部对工人说：“只要是能拿瓦刀的工人，到北京就给二万五千元，来回路费由本公司负担。”这样，他们就把河北省建筑公司第三中队的五十多个长期工人全部拉走了。
    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局为了能多招收工人，曾过高地规定了四大福利待遇：一律管工人家属住房；除工资外，每人每日另发工地津贴最高六千元；每月发家庭补助费十三分；冬季每人发煤火津贴十三万元。中央重工业部基本建设处和中央铁道部临时建筑处等单位招收工人的福利待遇也过高。这些单位凭着过高的福利待遇，把其他单位的建筑工人拉过去。中央铁道部临时建筑处从中央建筑工程部直属工程公司拉走了长期工人阎树芳、宋英和基本工杨志通、萧建则、李福海等八人，至今未将这些工人送还中央建筑工程部直属工程公司。中央燃料工业部电业管理总局土木建筑公司从中央建筑工程部直属工程公司拉走了十二名工人，还以降低技术标准的办法（把一级工人抬高为二级工人），从上海招收了一部分工人。中央重工业部基本建设处从北京市建筑公司拉走了庄有年、张志鹏等八名工人。中央公安部工程队也从北京市建筑公司拉走了三十多名工人，待遇是：每日发工资二万五千元；学习一星期后，发一个月工资，放假回家，回来后，还要补发假期工资。
    由于这些单位这样错误地任意提高工资和福利待遇，北京市建筑工人很多都不安心在原单位工作，纷纷跳厂，打乱了北京市训练工人和固定工人的计划。北京市建筑公司每天都接到五、六件长期工人的辞职信，最多一天收到了二十封辞职信。该公司固定工人的工作受到了严重的影响。很多工人说：“没有高的工资，我们就不干！”该公司第五工程处每天有几十个工人要求增加工资。该公司第四工程处冬季训练工人工作刚开始两天，就有三十一名长期工人请求辞职到别的单位去工作。工人崔树发说：“如果增高了工资，我才愿留下来。”有些辞职未被批准的工人说：“现在不准走。将来不提高工资，我们还要走。”该公司第一工程处在去年十二月二十二日给工人上大课时，工人不安心听课，纷纷向主席台递条子，要求增多工资，要求辞职、请假。北京市建筑公司原来决定在冬季训练一万名工人，因为工人流动，不安心工作，至今未能全部开始训练。有些基本建设单位由于部分工人突然离开现场，其他工人的情绪也随着发生波动，影响了工作。北京工业学院修建工程处，因为有三十多名工人转到归绥市人民建筑公司去工作，其他工人不安心工作，工作效率突然下降。过去该工程处每工每日抹灰八平方公尺，现在每天只能抹灰六平方公尺。四十多个抹灰工人在半个月内，少抹灰九百多平方公尺，使得该处工程被迫推迟了完工的日期。
    【又讯】绥远省归绥市人民建筑公司，随便招收建筑工人，影响了农业生产工作。该公司在去年八月二十六日派宋潮清、吕振铠两人到河北省青县、建国县招收建筑工人。宋、吕两人在青县车站公开设立建筑工人招收站。他们通过纪根风、纪根元、潘光谱、黄自清等私人关系到各地动员建筑工人去绥远，声言：“绥远省工资大、有活做，管接管送。”纪根风还计划把杨柳青的在职建筑工人，全部招到绥远作工。潘光谱还准备下请帖，约请各村建筑工人。当地有些农民听说绥远省在青县车站招收工人，竟脱离了已组织好的秋收互助组，报名去绥远作工。有些农民从七、八十里以外赶到青县车站报名，影响了农业生产工作。该公司原来规定在去年九月三日前招收工人三百九十多名，但他们没有及时停止招收工作，到现在，报名登记的已达六百二十七名。当报名的工人已经动身往绥远时，该公司却说：“本公司工人已招足，招收来的遣送回家。”这样，引起工人极大的不满。有些工人已行至北京，准备换车赴绥远，该公司又要他们回家，发给路费。有的工人领到路费后，东奔西跑，在北京市内找职业，影响了北京市劳动就业工作和社会秩序。
