Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The peoples of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic commemorated the 29th anniversary of the passing of Lenin, the immortal leader of the world's working people.

On the 20th, a commemorative meeting was held in the Hall of the Council of Ministers in Warsaw, the Polish capital, under the auspices of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. Attending the meeting were party and government leaders headed by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, representatives from all walks of life in Warsaw, and more than 1,500 people, including the envoys of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to Poland. Władysław Matwin, First Secretary of the Warsaw Municipal Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a lengthy report at the commemorative meeting. He pointed out the enormous help of the world worker movement leaders Lenin and Stalin to the Polish worker movement. Matwin said that thanks to the victory of the Lenin-Stalin party and the establishment of the Soviet state, the Polish people gained freedom twice. Under the guidance of Lenin-Stalinism, the Polish United Workers' Party defeated opportunists like the right-wing Polish Socialist Party members and the Gomułka faction, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The Polish people are realizing Lenin's ideas and are victoriously building socialism.

People in towns and villages throughout Poland also held commemorative meetings or lectures. Many places also organized exhibitions introducing Lenin's works and life.

The people of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, held a grand meeting on the 21st at the "Krastyo Sarafov" National Theatre to commemorate Lenin's death. Present were Vulko Chervenkov, General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, other party and government leaders, representatives of mass organizations, and labor heroes. Nako Babazov, Secretary of the Sofia City Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out: The longer the time passes since the death of the great Lenin, the closer progressive humanity becomes to his name. Now there is no place in the world that does not feel the influence of Lenin's thought. Now more than ever, it can be said that Lenin lives forever, he lives in the writings of Comrade Stalin, he lives in the great projects already created by the Soviet people, he lives in the victory of Leninism in the people's democratic countries, he lives in the growing international communist and worker movement, he lives in the rising worldwide movement to defend peace and oppose war.

Many towns and villages in Bulgaria organized lectures and symposiums introducing the Soviet state and the victories of Soviet communist construction. Workers in factories also widely launched labor competitions in commemoration of Lenin.
