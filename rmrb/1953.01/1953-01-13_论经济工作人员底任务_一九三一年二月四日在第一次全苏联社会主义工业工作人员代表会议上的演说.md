Comrades! Your delegates' meeting is coming to a close. Now you are about to pass resolutions. I believe that your draft resolutions will be unanimously adopted. In these resolutions—of which I know a rough outline—you will approve the industrial development program for 1931 and assume responsibility for completing it.

What Bolsheviks say is not just for fun. Bolsheviks always deliver on their promises. But what does it mean to take responsibility for completing the 1931 program? It means guaranteeing a 45 percent increase in total industrial production. And this is a very big task. Not only that. By taking on this responsibility, you are not only promising to complete our Five-Year Plan in four years—that is already decided, and there is no need for any resolutions—but also promising to complete the Five-Year Plan in three years for the decisive basic industrial sectors.

It is of course a good thing that the delegates' meeting promises to complete the 1931 plan and the Five-Year Plan in three years. But we have already learned from "bitter experience." We know that promises are not always kept. In early 1930, there were also promises to complete the plan for that year. At that time, it was necessary to increase our industrial production by 31 percent, 32 percent. But this promise was not fully fulfilled. In fact, industrial production increased by only 25 percent in 1930. We should ask: Will this situation be repeated this year? Now, our industrial leaders, our industrial workers, are promising to increase industrial production by 45 percent in 1931. But what can guarantee that this promise will be fulfilled this time?

What conditions are necessary to complete the program, to increase production by 45 percent, to complete the Five-Year Plan in the decisive basic sectors in three years instead of four?

For this, there are two basic conditions:

First, there must be real possibilities, or what we usually call "objective" possibilities.

Second, there must be the will and skill to lead enterprises, so as to turn these possibilities into reality.

Did we have the "objective" possibilities to complete the plan last year? Yes, we did. There are many irrefutable facts to prove this. These facts are that in March and April of last year, industrial production exceeded the previous year by 31 percent. We ask why we did not complete the annual plan? What hindered this? What was lacking? The skill to utilize existing possibilities was not enough. The skill to correctly lead factories and mines was not enough.

We had the first condition, that is, the "objective" possibilities necessary to complete the plan. But we did not fully possess the second condition, that is, the skill to lead production work. And precisely because the skill to lead production work was not enough, the plan was not completed. We did not increase industrial production by 31 percent, 32 percent, but only by 25 percent.

Of course, a 25 percent increase is already a big thing. In 1930, no capitalist country had any increase in production, and there is no increase now. On the contrary, the production of every capitalist country is plummeting. Under such conditions, a 25 percent increase is a great progress. But we could have increased it even more, because we had all the necessary "objective" conditions.

Then, how can we guarantee that the strange things of last year will not be repeated, that the plan will be fully completed, that all the possibilities will be fully utilized by us, that your promises will not remain partly empty words on paper?

In the history of all countries, in the history of all states, in the history of all armies, there are often such situations: when there are all the possibilities for victory, but these possibilities are not utilized, because the leaders did not see these possibilities, did not know how to use these possibilities, and the army suffered defeat.

Do we have all the possibilities necessary to complete the 1931 program?

Yes, we have this possibility.

What is this possibility, and what conditions are necessary to turn this possibility into reality?

First of all, our country must have sufficient natural resources: iron ore, coal, oil, grain, and cotton. Do we have these things? Yes, we do. And more than any other country. Take the Urals, for example, the Urals are a collection of resources that no country has. Iron ore, coal, oil, grain, everything is complete, everything is available! Our country has everything except rubber. And in another year or two, we will even have rubber. In this regard, in terms of natural resources, we are fully guaranteed, even more than enough.

What else is needed?

Also needed is a regime that is willing and able to promote the utilization of these huge natural resources for the benefit of the people. Do we have such a regime? Yes, we do. Of course, in our work of utilizing natural resources, we sometimes encounter friction among our own staff. For example, the Soviet regime had to fight some battles last year on the issue of establishing a second coal and iron base, and we cannot continue to develop without a second coal and iron base. But we have overcome these obstacles. We will have this base in the near future.

What else is needed?

Also needed is that this regime is supported by millions of workers and peasants. Is our regime supported by this support? Yes, it is supported by this support. There is no regime in the world that is as deeply supported by workers and peasants as the Soviet regime. I will not cite various facts, such as the growth of socialist competition, the development of shock work, and the movement of workers to fight for the industrial and financial plan. All these facts that prove that millions of people support the Soviet regime are well known. What else is needed to complete and exceed the 1931 program? Also needed is a system that does not suffer from the incurable diseases of capitalism, and is far superior to capitalism. Crisis, unemployment, waste and mass poverty are the incurable diseases of capitalism. Our system does not suffer from these problems, because power is in our hands, in the hands of the working class, because we are carrying out a planned economy, planning to accumulate resources, and allocating them correctly to the various sectors of the national economy. We do not suffer from the incurable diseases of capitalism. This is what distinguishes us from capitalism, this is our advantage over the capitalist system, and this advantage is of decisive significance. Look at how capitalists are trying to get rid of the crisis. They try to reduce workers' wages as much as possible. They try to reduce the prices of raw materials and grain as much as possible. But they are unwilling to seriously reduce the prices of industrial products. This means that they want to get rid of the crisis by exploiting the main consumers of commodities, by exploiting the workers and peasants of their own country, and by exploiting the laboring people of the countries that produce raw materials and grain. The capitalists are digging the foundation of their own. So the result is not to get rid of the crisis, but to deepen the crisis, creating a new prerequisite for brewing a new and more severe crisis. Our advantage lies in the fact that we have no crisis of overproduction at all, we have no and will not have millions of unemployed workers, we have no anarchy of production, because we are carrying out a planned economy. Not only that. Our country is the most industrialized country. This means that we can build our industry with the best technology, thus ensuring unprecedented labor productivity and unprecedented accumulation speed. Our past weakness was that our industry was based on scattered and small-scale agriculture. But this is in the past. The situation is different now. In the near future, maybe in another year, we will become the country with the largest scale of agriculture in the world. The Soviet farms and collective farms—which are also large-scale agricultural forms—produced half of the total national grain commodities this year. This means that our system—the Soviet system—enables us to move forward at a speed that no bourgeois country can dream of.

What else is needed to move forward rapidly?

Also needed is a party that is fully united, able to concentrate the efforts of all the outstanding members of the working class on one goal, experienced, not afraid of difficulties, and able to consistently implement the correct revolutionary Bolshevik policy. Do we have such a party? Yes, we do. Is its policy correct? Yes, it is correct, because this policy has brought us great success. This is now acknowledged not only by the friends of the working class, but even by the enemies of the working class. Look at how the well-known "noble" gentlemen—America's Fish, Britain's Churchill, and France's Poincaré—are frantically barking at our party. Why are they barking so frantically? It is because our party's policy is correct, because this policy has brought us continuous victories.

Comrades, these are all the possibilities that make it easy for us to realize the 1931 program, so that we can complete the Five-Year Plan in four years, and even in three years in the decisive sectors.

In this way, we have the first condition necessary for completing the plan, that is, "objective" possibilities.

Do we have the second condition, that is, the skill to utilize this possibility?

In other words, do we have the correct leadership for factories and mines? Is everything going well here?

Unfortunately, everything is not going well. Since we are Bolsheviks, we should say this frankly and openly.

What is leading production? Some of us do not always look at the issue of enterprise leadership from a Bolshevik perspective. Some of us often think that leadership is just signing documents. This is of course regrettable, but it is the truth. Sometimes it is impossible not to think of the blind governor in Shchedrin's novel. Do you remember how the blind governor's wife taught her blind governor son? The wife said to her son: Don't study hard, don't understand things, let others do this, it's not your business—your business is to lead, to sign documents. What shames us is that even among us Bolsheviks, there are many people who rely solely on signing documents to lead. If you want them to understand things, to be proficient in technology, to become experts, then they will say "no" several times.

We ask: Why are we Bolsheviks, who have carried out three revolutions, who have won victory in the cruel civil war, who have solved the biggest industrial construction tasks, who have led the peasants onto the socialist road, why have we succumbed to documents in the leadership of production work?

The reason is that signing documents is much easier than actually leading production work. So many economic workers have taken the path of least resistance. There is also our fault here, the fault of the central organs. Ten years ago, a slogan was put forward: "Since the Communist Party members do not yet fully understand production technology, since they still need to learn how to manage the economy, then let the old technicians, old engineers, and old experts manage production, and you Communist Party members should not interfere in technical work; however, although you do not interfere, you must also strive to study technology, strive to study production management, so that in the future you can become real production leaders, real experts, together with the experts who are loyal to us." The slogan was like this. But what actually happened? As a result, the latter part of this formula was abandoned, because learning is more difficult than signing on paper, and the former part of this formula was vulgarized, and the words "do not interfere" were misinterpreted as refusing to study production technology. As a result, a nonsense, a dangerous and harmful nonsense, was created, which should be gotten rid of as soon as possible.

Actual life itself has repeatedly warned us that the situation in this regard is not good. The Shakhty case was the first warning sign. The Shakhty case has pointed out that the revolutionary vigilance of party organizations and trade unions is not enough. This event pointed out that our economic workers are really far behind in technical knowledge; many old engineers and old technicians are more likely to go down the road of sabotage because no one is supervising their work, especially because foreign enemies are constantly entangling them with various "suggestions." The "Industrial Party" public trial was the second warning sign.

The basic reason for sabotage is of course class struggle. The class enemies are of course frantically resisting the socialist offensive. However, it is not enough to explain the fact that sabotage is so rampant and prevalent with this alone.

How can sabotage be so rampant and prevalent? Who should be blamed for this? We should blame ourselves. If we had not handled the leadership of production affairs in that way, if we had started studying work technology much earlier, started to be proficient in technology, if we had interfered more often and appropriately in economic leadership, then the saboteurs would not have been able to do so much sabotage.

We ourselves must become experts, become experts in work, we ourselves must turn to strive to learn technical knowledge—this is what actual life is pushing us to do. However, neither the first warning sign, nor even the second warning sign, has guaranteed the necessary transformation. It is already, and long has been, the time to face technology. It is already the time to abandon the old slogan of not interfering with technology, which is outdated, and to become experts ourselves, to become knowledgeable people, to become complete experts.

People often ask: Why is there no one-man management in our enterprises? Before we have mastered technology, we will not have one-man management, and there will be no one-man management. Before we have a sufficient number of talents among us, among the Bolsheviks, who are familiar with technical issues, economic issues, and financial issues, we will not have real one-man management. If you are not proficient in the technology, economy, and finance of factories and mines, then no matter how many resolutions you write, no matter how you swear, it will be useless, and there will be no one-man management.

Therefore, the task is that we must be proficient in technology ourselves, we must become experts in work ourselves. Only in this way can we guarantee that our plan is fully completed; only in this way can we guarantee that one-man management can be realized.

This is of course not an easy thing, but it is a completely solvable thing. Science, technical experience, knowledge—all of these things can be obtained. If you don't have it today, you will have it tomorrow. The main point here is to have the Bolshevik's fervent will to be proficient in technology and to be proficient in production science. As long as there is a fervent will, then everything can be done, everything can be solved.

People sometimes ask: Can't we slow down a little bit, delay the progress rate? No, we can't, comrades! We must never slow down! On the contrary, we must try our best to increase the speed as much as possible. The obligations we owe to the workers and peasants in the Soviet Union require us to do so. The obligations we owe to the working class all over the world require us to do so.

Slowing down means falling behind. And those who fall behind will be beaten. But we don't want to be beaten. No, we absolutely don't want to! In the history of old Russia, one of the things is that it was often beaten because it was backward. The Mongol Khans beat it. The Turkish aristocrats beat it. The Swedish feudal lords beat it. The Polish and Lithuanian landlords beat it. The British and French capitalists beat it. The Japanese lords beat it. Everyone beat it, because it was backward. Because its military equipment was backward, its culture was backward, its state affairs were backward, its industry was backward, and its agriculture was backward. Everyone beat it, because this was both profitable and would not be retaliated against. You remember the words of a poet before the revolution: "Mother Russia, you are rich, you are thin; you are strong, you are weak." These gentlemen know this passage of the old poet very well. While beating, they scolded: "Since you are rich," it is okay to make a fortune on you. While beating, they scolded:

"Since you are thin and weak," you can be beaten and robbed at will. Hitting the backward, hitting the weak—this is the law of the exploiters. This is the law of the capitalist jungle. If you are backward, if you are weak, then you are unreasonable, so you can be beaten and enslaved. If you are strong and powerful, then you are reasonable, so you must be treated with caution.

Precisely because of this, we must not fall behind again.

In the past, we did not have and could not have a motherland. But now, when we have overthrown capitalism, and our regime is the workers' regime, we already have a motherland, and we will insist on its independence. Do you want our socialist motherland to be broken and lose its independence? If you don't want to, then you should eliminate its backwardness in the shortest possible time and carry out the real Bolshevik speed in its socialist economic construction. There is no other way. Precisely because of this, Lenin said at the time of the October Revolution: "Either perish, or catch up with and surpass the advanced capitalist countries."

We are fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries. We should run through this distance within ten years. Either we can do this, or we will be beaten.

This is what our obligations to the workers and peasants in the Soviet Union require of us.

However, we have another obligation, a greater and more important obligation. This is our obligation to the world proletariat. This obligation is consistent with the first obligation. But we value this obligation even more. The Soviet working class is a part of the world working class. We have won, not only because of the efforts of the Soviet working class, but also because of the support of the world working class. Without this support, we would have been crushed long ago. People say that our country is the shock force of the world proletariat. This is of course very good. But precisely because of this, we have a very heavy obligation. Why does the international proletariat support us? Why do we deserve this support? It is because we were the first to fight against capitalism, we were the first to establish a workers' regime, and we were the first to start socialist social construction. It is because once what we do succeeds, it will turn the whole world over and liberate the entire working class. But how can we achieve this success? It is necessary to eradicate our backward situation and strengthen the Bolshevik's high construction speed. We should move forward in such a way that workers all over the world can look at us and say: Look, this is our vanguard, this is our shock force, this is our workers' regime, our motherland, they are doing their own things, which is also doing everyone's things for us, they are doing well, let us all help them against the capitalists, and promote the cause of world revolution. Should we live up to the expectations of the world working class, should we fulfill our obligations to them? Yes, we should, if we don't want to completely lose face. This is our obligation, our domestic obligation and our international obligation.

You see, it is these obligations that require us to adopt the Bolshevik development speed.

I am not saying that we have not made any achievements in the leadership of economic work in recent years. There are, and many. We have increased industrial output to more than double the pre-war level. We have created the world's largest agricultural production. However, if we had seriously and diligently mastered production, mastered production technology, and mastered the finance and economy of production during this period, then we would have been able to make more achievements.

At most, we will have to run through the distance we are behind the advanced capitalist countries in ten years. We have all the "objective" possibilities to do this. What is lacking is just the skill to truly utilize these possibilities. And this depends on ourselves. And only depends on ourselves! It is already time to learn how to utilize these possibilities. It is already time to abandon that corrupt policy of not interfering in production work. It is already time to understand another policy, that is, the new policy of interfering in everything, which is suitable for the present period. If you are a factory manager, you have to interfere in everything, you have to be familiar with everything and not neglect anything, you have to study, study again and again. Bolsheviks should be proficient in technology. It is already time for Bolsheviks themselves to become experts. During the transformation period, technology determines everything. It is a joke, not an economic worker, for someone who is engaged in economic work to be unwilling to study technology and unwilling to be proficient in technology.

Some people say that mastering technology is a difficult thing. This is wrong! Bolsheviks are invincible and invincible. We have solved many of the most difficult tasks. We have overthrown the capitalist system. We have seized power. We have created a huge socialist industry. We have led the middle peasants onto the socialist road. We have done the most important things in construction. There is not much left for us to do: it is to study technology and be proficient in science. And when we do this, we will have a speed that we cannot dream of now. As long as we really want to do this, we will definitely do this!

    论经济工作人员底任务
    ——一九三一年二月四日在第一次全苏联社会主义工业工作人员代表会议上的演说
    斯大林
    编者按：本报元旦社论中曾引述斯大林同志“论经济工作人员底任务”的演说中的论点；今天本报发表的中央财政经济委员会召开所属各部部长会议的消息中，薄一波同志也引述了斯大林同志在这一篇演说中的论点。这一篇演说的内容，对于我们目前的情况来说，也是重要的指示。现在我们把斯大林同志的这一篇演说的全文转载在这里，希望我们所有的经济工作人员，特别是领导干部，仔细地加以阅读，并认真地加以讨论，使它成为我们的有力武器，来彻底肃清我们的许多领导机关和领导干部的一般化领导作风，树立深入的具体的领导作风，以改进我们的经济工作。
    同志们！你们的代表会议工作快要结束了。现在你们要通过决议了。我相信你们的决议草案一定会一致通过的。在这些决议中——你们的决议，我是略知大概的——你们将赞同一九三一年工业发展大纲，并担负起完成这个大纲的责任。
    布尔什维克所说的话，不是说得好玩的。布尔什维克总是约许了就要执行的。可是，担起完成一九三一年大纲的责任，这是什么意思呢？这就是说保证把工业生产总量增加百分之四十五。而这乃是一个很大的任务。不仅如此。你们担起这样的责任，那就是说你们不仅约许要在四年内完成我们的五年计划，——这是已经解决的事情，再不须要有什么决议，——而且约许要在三年内完成有决定意义的基本工业部门方面的五年计划。
    代表会议约许完成一九三一年计划，约许在三年内完成五年计划，这当然很好。但我们已经受过“辛酸经验”的教训。我们知道，约言并不是时常都被履行的。在一九三○年初，也曾约许过完成该年度的计划。当时必须把我们的工业生产额增加百分之三十一，百分之三十二。但这个约言是没有完全履行的。事实上，一九三○年的工业生产额只增加百分之二十五。我们应当问一问：今年不会重复这种情形么？现在，我们的工业领导者，我们的工业工作人员约许在一九三一年度把工业生产量增加百分之四十五。可是，有什么东西能担保这次约言一定会实现呢？
    为要完成大纲，为要把生产额增加百分之四十五，为要不是在四年内，而是在三年内完成有决定意义的基本部门方面的五年计划，就要有什么条件呢？
    为此就要有两个基本条件：
    第一是要有实在的可能性，或如我们通常所谓“客观的”可能性。
    第二是要有领导各企业的志愿和技能，以便把这些可能性变为现实。
    我们去年有过完成计划的“客观的”可能性么？是的，是有过的。关于这一点，有许多不容置辩的事实可以证明。这些事实就是去年三四月间，工业生产额超过前年百分之三十一。试问我们为什么没有完成全年计划呢？什么东西阻碍了这一点呢？什么东西不够呢？就是利用现有可能性的技能不够。正确领导工厂矿井的技能不够。
    我们有了第一个条件，即完成计划所必要的“客观的”可能性。可是我们却没充分具备有第二个条件，即领导生产工作的技能。而正因为领导生产工作的技能不够，所以计划也就没有完成。我们没有把工业生产额增加百分之三十一，三十二，而仅仅增加了百分之二十五。
    当然，百分之二十五的增长额已算是一件很大的事情。在一九三○年，任何一个资本主义国家底生产量都没有什么增长，而且现在也没有什么增长。相反的，无论那一个资本主义国家底生产都是一落千丈的。在这样的条件下，百分之二十五的增长额已算是一大进步。可是，我们本来能够增加得更多，因为我们曾有一切必要的“客观”条件。
    那末，要怎样才可担保不致又重复去年的怪事，才可担保完全完成计划，才可使所有的可能性都被我们尽量利用，才可使你们的约言不致有一部分仍旧成为纸上空文呢？
    在各国家历史中，在各国度历史中，在各军队历史中，往往有这样一种情形：当时虽有得胜奏捷的一切可能性，可是这些可能性并没有加以利用，因为领导者没有看见这些可能性，没有善于利用这些可能性，于是军队也就遭受了失败。
    我们有为完成一九三一年大纲所必需的一切可能性么？
    是的，我们有这种可能性。
    这种可能性是什么呢，要有什么条件才可把这种可能性变为现实呢？
    首先，就要我国具备有充足的天然富源：铁矿，煤炭，石油，粮食和棉花。我们有这些东西么？是有的。而且比任何其他国家都多些。就拿乌拉尔来说吧，乌拉尔是任何一国都没有的富源汇集区。铁矿，煤炭，石油，粮食，都是样样俱全，应有尽有！我国除橡皮以外，是连什么都有的。而且再过一两年，我们就连橡皮也会有了。在这方面说来，就天然富源来说，我们是完全有保障，甚至绰绰有余的。
    还要有什么呢？
    还要有一个愿意而且能够推动利用这些巨大天然富源来谋人民福利的政权。我们有这样一个政权么？是有的。固然，我们在利用天然富源方面的工作，有时不免遇到我们自己工作人员中间的磨擦。譬如，苏维埃政权去年在建立第二个煤铁根据地的问题上，不得不作一些斗争，而我们没有第二个煤铁根据地，是不能继续向前发展的。可是我们已把这些障碍克服了。我们在最近将来就会有这个根据地了。
    还要有什么呢？
    还要这个政权受着千百万工农群众的拥护。我们的政权受着这种拥护么？是的，受着这种拥护。在全世界上再没有那一个政权，是如苏维埃政权这样深受工农拥护的。我不来援引种种事实，如社会主义竞赛的增长，突击运动的发展，以及工人群众为迎展工业财政计划而奋斗的运动。所有这些显然证明千百万群众拥护苏维埃政权的事实，是尽人皆知的。为要完成并超过一九三一年大纲，还要有什么呢？还要有一个不患资本主义那种无可医治的病症，而又大大优越于资本主义的制度。危机，失业，浪费和大众贫困，这就是资本主义无可医治的病症。而我们的制度却不患这种毛病，因为政权是握在我们手里，握在工人阶级手里，因为我们进行着计划经济，有计划地积累资源，并按国民经济各部门来加以正确分配。我们不患资本主义所患的那种无可医治的病症。这就是我们和资本主义不同的地方，这就是我们优胜于资本主义制度的地方，而这种优胜处是有决定一切的意义的。请看资本家是想怎样摆脱危机吧。他们尽量减低工人工资。他们尽量减低原料和粮食价格。可是他们不愿多少认真减低工业品价格。这就是说，他们想用剥削主要商品消费者，用剥削本国工农群众，剥削原料粮食出产国的劳动群众的办法来摆脱危机。资本家自己掘毁自己立足的基地。所以结果就不是摆脱危机，而是加深危机，造成一种新的前提来酿成新的更剧烈的危机。我们的优胜处就在于我们根本没有什么生产过剩危机，我们没有而且不会有几百万失业工人，我们没有生产无政府状态，因为我们进行着有计划的经济。不仅如此。我们的国家是工业最集中的国家。这就是说，我们能够用最优良的技术来建设我们的工业，因而保证空前未有的劳动生产率，空前未有的积累速度。我们过去的弱点就在于我国工业是以涣散狭小农业为根据的。可是这已成为过去了。现在情形已经不同了。在不远的将来，也许再过一年，我们就会成为世界上农业规模最大的国家。苏维埃农庄和集体农庄——而它们也就是大农业形式——在今年出产的谷物商品，已等于全国谷物商品总额半数。这就是说，我们的制度——苏维埃制度——使我们能按任何一个资产阶级国家都梦想不到的速度前进。　为要一日千里地向前猛进，还要有什么呢？　还要有一个充分团结一致，能把工人阶级一切优秀分子底努力都集中于一个目标上去，富有经验，不会见难而退，而能一贯实行正确的革命的布尔什维主义的政策的政党。我们有这样一个政党么？是的，是有的。它的政策正确么？是的，是正确的，因为这个政策使我们获得重大的成功。这一点，现在不仅是工人阶级底朋友，就连工人阶级底敌人也承认了。请看吧，大家皆知的“高贵”先生——美国的菲诗，英国的邱吉尔，法国的普恩加赉是如何向我们党拚命狂吠呀。为什么他们这样拚命狂吠呢？就是因为我们党底政策正确，因为这政策使我们获得节节不断的胜利。
    同志们，这就是使我们易于实现一九三一年大纲，使我们能在四年内，而在有决定意义部门中，甚至能在三年内完成五年计划的一切可能性。
    这样，为完成计划所必需的第一个条件，即“客观的”可能性，我们是具备了。
    我们有没有第二个条件，即利用这种可能性的技能呢？
    换句话说，我们有对于工厂矿井的正确领导么？在这里是百事大吉么？
    可惜不是百事大吉。我们既是布尔什维克，就应当爽直而坦白地说出这一点。
    什么是领导生产呢？我们有些人并不是常常用布尔什维克观点来看待企业领导问题的。我们有些人往往以为领导就是签署文件。这当然是令人痛心的，但这是事实。有时候令人不得不想起谢德林小说中的瞎知事。你们记得瞎知事太太怎样教训瞎知事儿子的故事吧。太太对儿子说：不要用功学习呵，不要谙通事理呵，让别人去干这种事情吧，这不是你的事情呀，——你的事情就是领导，就是签署文件。使我们丢脸的，就是甚至在我们布尔什维克中间，也有不少的人是专靠签署文件来进行领导的。如果你要他们谙通事理，精通技术，变成内行，那他们就会连说几个“不”字了。
    试问：我们布尔什维克是干过三次革命的人，是在残酷国内战争中获得了胜利的人，是把最大的工业建设任务解决了的人，是把农民引上了社会主义道路的人，为什么在领导生产工作方面竟会屈服于文件呢？
    原因就在于签署文件要比切实领导生产工作容易得多。于是许多经济工作人员也就走上这条阻力最少的道路。这里并且有我们的过咎，中央机关底过咎。在十年以前提出了一个口号：“既然共产党员还不充分了解生产技术，既然他们还须要学习管理经济，那末就让旧技师、旧工程师和旧专门家去管理生产吧，而你们共产党员则不要去干预工作技术；可是，虽说不干预，但同时务必努力研究技术，努力研究生产管理学，以便将来能与忠于我们的专门家一同成为真正的生产领导者，真正的内行”。口号曾是这样。而在实际上又是怎样呢？结果，这个公式后一部分是被抛弃了，因为学习是比纸上署名难些，而这个公式前一部分则被人庸俗化了，“不干预”几字竟被人曲解为拒绝研究生产技术。结果竟酿成一种胡说，危险而有害的胡说，这种胡说是摆脱得愈快愈好的。
    实际生活本身再三警告过我们说，在这方面的情形不好。沙赫特案件就是第一个警号。沙赫特案件已经指明党组织和职工会底革命警觉性是不够的。这一事件指明我们经济工作人员在技术知识方面，实在是落后得不成样子；许多旧工程师和旧技师，因为没有人监督他们的工作，就比较容易滚入暗害道路，尤其是因为国外敌人又不断用种种“建议”来缠绕他们。“工业党”公审案就是第二个警号。
    暗害勾当底基本原因当然是阶级斗争。阶级敌人当然是疯狂反抗社会主义进攻的。可是，单用这一点来解释暗害勾当如此猖獗盛行的事实，那就不够了。
    暗害勾当怎么会能这样猖獗盛行呢？这应归咎于何人呢？这应归咎于我们自己。如果我们不是那样处理生产领导事情，如果我们在更早得多以前就已开始研究工作技术，开始精通技术，如果我们更时常而恰当地干预过经济领导工作，那么暗害分子就会作不出这样多的暗害事情了。
    要我们自己变成专门家，变成工作内行，要我们自己转而努力学习技术知识，——这就是实际生活推动我们来干的事情。可是，无论第一个警号，甚至第二个警号，都还没有保证发生必要的转变。已经是，而且早已经是面向技术的时候了。已经是抛弃那种过时的不干预技术的旧口号，而要自己成为专门家，成为谙通事情者，成为完全内行的时候了。
    有人时常问道：为什么在我们企业里没有一长制呢？在我们尚未有精通技术以前，我们就没有一长制，而且不会有一长制。在我们中间，在布尔什维克中间，还没有充分数量熟悉技术问题、经济问题以及财政问题的人材以前，我们就不会有真正的一长制。如果你们不精通工厂矿井底技术、经济以及财政，那么随便你们写多少决议，随便你们怎样宣誓，也是无济于事的，也不会有一长制的。
    因此，任务就是要我们自己精通技术，要我们自己成为工作内行。只有如此，才可以保证我们的计划完全完成；也只有如此，才可以保证一长制能见诸实现。
    这当然不是容易的事情，但这是完全可以解决的事情。科学，技术经验，知识，——凡此种种都是可以求得的东西。今天没有，明天就会有了。这里的主要点就是要有布尔什维克的热烈志愿去精通技术，精通生产学。只要有热烈志愿，那就一切都可办到，一切都可解决了。
    人们有时发问：难道不可稍许减低速度，延缓进展速率么？不行的，不可以的，同志们！决不可减低速度！恰巧相反，还必须竭力和尽可能增加速度哩。我们在苏联工农面前所负的义务要我们这样做。我们在全世界工人阶级面前所负的义务要我们这样做。
    延缓速度，就是落后。而落后者是要挨打的。但我们不愿挨打。不，我们绝对不愿意！旧俄罗斯底历史，其中有一点就是常因落后而挨打。蒙古的可汗打过它。土耳其的贵族打过它。瑞典的封建主打过它。波兰和立陶宛的地主打过它。英法的资本家打过它。日本的爵士打过它。大家都打过它，就是因为它落后。因为它的军备落后，文化落后，国政落后，工业落后，农业落后。大家都打过它，就是因为这既可获利，又不致受到报应。你们记得革命前期的一位诗人底语句吧：“罗斯妈妈呵：你又丰富，你又单薄；你又强大，你又软弱”。这些老爷们是把旧时诗人底这一段话背得很熟的。他们一面打着，一面又笑骂道：“你既然丰富”，那就不妨靠你发财。他们一面打着，一面又笑骂道：
    “你既然单薄软弱”，那就可以随便打你抢你。打击落后者，打击弱者，——这就是剥削者底法则。这就是资本主义弱肉强食的法则。你落后了，你软弱无力么，那你就算是无理，于是也就可以打你，可以奴役你。你强大有力么，那你就算是有理，于是就得小心对待你。
    正因为如此，所以我们不可再落后。
    在过去，我们是没有而且也不能有祖国的。但是现在，当我们已推翻资本主义，而我国政权又是工人政权时，我们已有祖国，而且我们将坚持其独立。你们愿不愿让我们社会主义祖国被人打破而丧失独立呢？如果你们不愿意，那你们就应当在最短时期内消灭它的落后状况，而开展其社会主义经济建设中的真正的布尔什维克的速度。除此而外，再没有别的办法。正因为如此，所以列宁在十月革命时说过：“或是灭亡，或是赶上并超过先进资本主义国家”。
    我们比先进国家落后了五十以至一百年。我们应当在十年以内跑完这个距离。或者是我们能做到这一点，或者就是我们会被人打翻。
    这就是我们在苏联工农面前的义务所要求于我们的。
    可是，我们还有其他一种义务，更巨大更重要的义务。这就是我们在世界无产阶级面前的义务。这种义务是与第一种义务相符合的。但我们却把这种义务看得更高。苏联工人阶级是世界工人阶级中的
    一部分。我们所以胜利了，不仅是由于有苏联工人阶级努力，而且是由于有世界工人阶级拥护。如果没有这种拥护，那我们就会早被粉碎了。人们说，我国是全世界无产阶级底突击队。这当然说得很好。但正因为如此，所以我们就担负有极重大的义务。国际无产阶级为什么拥护我们呢？我们为什么配受这种拥护呢？就是因为我们最先动手去与资本主义交锋，我们最先建立了工人政权，我们最先开始了社会主义社会建设。就是因为我们所做的事情一经成功，就会翻转整个世界而解放全体工人阶级。可是要怎样才能达到这个成功呢？就是要铲除我国落后情况，加强布尔什维克高度建设速度。我们应当如此前进，使全世界工人可以望着我们说道：看哪，这就是我们的先锋队，这就是我们的突击队，这就是我们的工人政权，我们的祖国，他们干着他们自己的事情，也就是干着我们大家的事情，他们干得好，让我们大家来帮助他们反对资本家，并促进世界革命事业吧。我们应当不辜负世界工人阶级这种厚望么，应当履行我们在他们面前的义务么？是的，是应当的，如果我们不愿完全丢脸的话。这就是我们的义务，我们的国内义务和国际义务。　你们看，就是这些义务要我们采取布尔什维克的发展速度。
    我并不是说我们近几年来在经济领导工作方面没有丝毫成绩。有的，而且很多。我们已把工业出产量增加到超过战前一倍了。我们已创立起世界上最大的农业生产。可是，如果我们在这个时期中努力认真精通了生产，精通了生产技术，精通了生产底财政和经济，那我们就会能作出更多的成绩来。
    我们至多是在十年当中就要跑完我们落后于先进资本主义国家的距离。我们有一切“客观的”可能性来做到这一点。所缺乏的，只是真正利用这些可能性的技能。而这是取决于我们自己的。并且只是取决于我们自己的！已经是学会利用这些可能性的时候了。已经是抛弃那不干预生产工作的腐败方针的时候了。已经是领会另一个方针，即适合现时期的要干预一切的新方针的时候了。你既是个工厂经理，就得干预一切事务，就要熟悉一切而连什么也不要忽略过去，就得学习，再三学习。布尔什维克应当精通技术。已经是布尔什维克自己成为专门家的时候了。在改造时期，技术决定一切。一个担任经济工作的人，竟不愿意研究技术，不愿意精通技术，那就是闹笑话，而不是经济工作人员了。
    有人说，精通技术是一件困难事情。这是不对的！布尔什维克是无坚不摧，无攻不克的。我们已解决了许多最困难的任务。我们已推翻了资本主义制度。我们已取得了政权。我们已创立了极大的社会主义工业。我们已把中农引上了社会主义道路。建设方面最重要的事情，我们已经做成了。剩下来要我们做的事情，已经是不多了：就是要研究技术，精通科学。而当我们做到这步时，我们就会有我们现在梦想不到的速度。只要我们真正愿意这样干，我们是一定会做到这步的！
