How Shenyang City's Seventy-Seven Spare-Time Party Schools Were Established
The Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Brief Overview
Shenyang City's cadre spare-time party schools have grown to seventy-seven, with most of the city's cadres participating in elementary and intermediate theoretical study. The establishment of cadre spare-time party schools has greatly changed the situation of a lack of organization in cadres' political theory learning.

From the liberation of Shenyang in 1948 to 1951, the main method of learning for on-the-job cadres was self-study organized by each department, supplemented by large reports and listening to the radio. The learning content at that time was mainly basic political education, combined with the study of the Party's policies. By 1951, the ideological level of cadres had improved to a certain extent, and the previous method of all cadres learning the same course and listening to the same report could no longer meet the different requirements of cadres. However, various work and mass movements were very urgent, and many cadres did not fully recognize the significance of learning, so the learning situation of cadres was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, sometimes intermittent.

In order to strengthen Marxist-Leninist theoretical education to meet the needs of economic construction and work development, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee studied the central government's instructions on strengthening cadre education and the Northeast Bureau's instructions in 1951, and decided to establish spare-time party schools. Before opening, the Municipal Party Committee criticized the empiricist tendency of many cadres to neglect politics and be busy with affairs, and stipulated that responsible Party cadres in each department must attach importance to the leadership of cadres' political theory learning. The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and Party committees at all levels carried out in-depth ideological mobilization and made relatively thorough concrete preparations (training teachers, organizing groups, compiling and printing teaching materials, etc.) before formally establishing spare-time party schools in May 1951. At that time, 25,100 Party and non-Party cadres participated in the study. One of the characteristics of Shenyang City's spare-time party schools is that the schools are basically established according to production units or organs, trying not to have joint schools between different organs, so that teaching can be carried out according to the specific conditions of each unit.

In October 1951, in order to cooperate with the Party rectification movement, the elementary and intermediate spare-time party schools switched from studying social development history and political common sense to studying the eight conditions for a Communist Party member. Theoretical study was temporarily suspended during the Three-Anti movement, and the spare-time party schools suspended work. After the Three-Anti movement, the enthusiasm of cadres for studying political theory generally increased. By early September of last year, spare-time party schools had gradually resumed and developed. At present, there are seventy-seven spare-time party schools in the city, with 29,650 students (accounting for 41 percent of the city's total of 71,367 cadres). Among them, there are three intermediate spare-time party schools: one for the Municipal Party Committee, with 734 students; one for the Municipal Government, with 588 students; and one for the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions (including cadres from various mass organizations and enterprises), with 426 students. The above three schools have a total of 1,748 students. There are seventy-four elementary spare-time party schools, distributed in fourteen municipal-level organs, with 6,909 students; thirty factories, with 12,301 students; and thirty districts, with 8,892 students; for a total of 28,102 students.

According to the experience of the 1951 pilot program and the feedback after the restoration this time, adopting the form of spare-time party schools to organize general cadres for theoretical study is an effective method and is generally welcomed by cadres. Everyone said: "Since the establishment of spare-time party schools, learning can be carried out regularly, unlike in the past when it was 'three ups and three downs'." "Learning has become systematic and regular." "It can be done step by step, and you can really learn something systematically." "There are teachers giving lectures on schedule, unlike before when relying solely on group discussions was very slow." Facts have proved that this method is worth adhering to and promoting.

The Concern and Support of the Leading Organs Played
        A Huge Role
The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and the attention and specific leadership of Party organizations at all levels are important keys to running spare-time party schools well.

The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee regards leading the political theory learning of on-the-job cadres as a major task and stipulates that responsible Party cadres in each department must make leading political theory learning and strengthening their own learning as one of their main tasks. The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee formally raised the issue of political theory learning for cadres at all levels to the Municipal Party Committee meeting for research and discussion. Responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee, such as Comrade Kai Feng, the former First Secretary, and Comrade Huang Oudong, the Second Secretary and Mayor, were very concerned about the work of cadre theory learning. After the spare-time party schools opened, the Municipal Party Committee and responsible cadres of each unit personally led the learning or gave lectures to the teachers. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee personally served as the principal of the intermediate spare-time party school. They and more than 70 senior cadres, such as members of the Municipal Party Committee and directors of municipal-level bureaus, served as teachers or learning consultants. These responsible cadres carefully prepared whether they were lecturing or answering questions.

When the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee opened the spare-time party schools in 1951, it approved 1.1 billion RMB of funding and established a library and reference room for the theoretical study of members of the Municipal Party Committee, and ten small libraries in each district and municipal-level organ. In September of last year, in order to restore the spare-time party schools, another 400 million RMB budget was approved. Comrades Kai Feng and Huang Oudong proposed that "we must supply cadres with the books they need for learning as fully and adequately as possible." In order to ensure cadres' learning time, the Municipal Party Committee stipulated that in addition to the two hours of daily learning time, the system stipulated by the Northeast People's Government of Wednesday afternoon as a learning day must also be implemented, and no meetings should be held during this time. The Municipal Party Committee also made more specific provisions for factory meetings and Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League activities in light of the work situation in factories and enterprises.

Party organizations at all levels also helped the spare-time party schools solve various difficulties. For example, the Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, the Municipal Public Enterprise Administration Bureau, and Factory 53 helped cadres solve specific difficulties such as transportation to and from class, meal times, and funding. This further encouraged cadres' enthusiasm for learning.

How the Teacher Problem Was Solved
Whether a spare-time party school can be established, or whether it can achieve good teaching results, one of the keys is whether it can organize a certain number and quality of teachers with relatively good levels. Only with a sufficient number of competent teachers can the spare-time party school have a solid foundation to persist.

Since Shenyang is the location of the Northeast Bureau, cadres are relatively concentrated, so it also has favorable conditions for solving the teacher difficulty. In addition to requesting the Northeast Bureau to assist in hiring teachers, the Municipal Party Committee also stipulated that it is the undeniable responsibility of all Party member cadres with a certain theoretical level to serve as teachers. The Municipal Party Committee stipulated that serving as a teacher is to complete the work of the Party. In this way, the teacher problem was solved, and enough teachers were organized to meet the needs of more than 70 schools. The Municipal Party Committee also adopted many of the following methods in organizing the daily work of teachers and helping them teach:

1. Lecturers composed of municipal-level responsible cadres specialize in lecturing to intermediate spare-time party schools. These responsible comrades are very busy, but each teacher only lectures once or twice in half a year, and they are notified two or three months in advance, so these responsible comrades can still serve as lecturers. Since there are few members of the lecturer group, they jointly run large joint spare-time party schools with various organs. At the same time, in order to help these responsible comrades prepare lessons, the study room of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department (formerly the theoretical research group) wrote brief teaching outlines for teachers' reference based on the content of the course. This includes the teaching focus, what main problems to solve, what to criticize, and what to connect with. The study room also pointed out the main and general reference books and specifically indicated the chapters of the reference books for explaining a certain issue. Secondly, introduce to the teachers the students' level and ideological situation, the difficulties and disputes that occurred in the preview, and sometimes introduce some teaching methods and experiences of the teachers. Thirdly, require teachers to write detailed popular outlines before class and submit them to the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department for review. Finally, a teacher meeting is held one or two weeks before the teacher lectures. In the meeting, the teacher first reports how they are preparing to teach, and then discussions are held to help the teacher further improve the teaching quality. After these processes, the teacher's lesson preparation time can be shortened, they can be helped to clarify the teaching focus, and the correctness of the content can be guaranteed. Many teachers feel that this is very helpful to them.

2. Run teacher training classes to train teachers of theoretical common sense and political common sense. The students participating in this training class are mainly teachers of spare-time party schools who cannot prepare lessons independently or have difficulty preparing lessons. The training class also absorbs outstanding learning activists from the Communist Youth League members and the masses to participate. Classes are concentrated in the Municipal Party Committee Auditorium every Sunday morning or every Wednesday afternoon. The role of the teacher training class has proven to be extremely great. It can help many teachers improve themselves while teaching, and implement the
    method of "learning while teaching." Some comrades can also do a better job of tutoring after studying. In 1952, a total of 718 people in the city participated in the teacher training class, including 356 teachers and 362 tutors; 665 Party member cadres and 53 non-Party cadres. After training, the general comrades have increased confidence in the work of being a teacher. This training class has also cultivated some excellent young lecturers, which is a very important gain.

3. Form a network of 428 teachers throughout the city, use them centrally, and distribute them uniformly. This is of great significance for improving teaching effectiveness. Although each factory, enterprise, organ, and school has hired some teachers, the number and quality of teachers vary greatly due to the different conditions of cadres in each department. General organs are stronger than factories, and large organs are stronger than small organs. Therefore, concentrating the use of teachers and uniformly allocating them can solve the difficulty of some units having few teachers and low quality. In terms of the use of teachers, it can be more planned. For example, it is not necessary for teachers to prepare all the content of a certain course, but several teachers can be responsible for certain chapters, and one teacher can specialize in lecturing on a certain chapter, adopting the method of circuit lectures, in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. This can reduce the burden of lesson preparation and facilitate the accumulation of experience.

4. Regularly provide teachers with learning materials. Strengthen teacher research.
    In 1951, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department compiled and wrote 40 kinds of reference materials and 28 kinds of reference outlines. In 1952, it compiled and issued 20 kinds of reference outlines and 8 kinds of reference materials. In addition, it also subscribed to "Learning Translation Series," "Learning" magazine, and "Learning Elementary Edition" for teachers.

In terms of teaching research, three teaching experience introduction conferences and two teaching observation meetings were held, and teachers were organized to observe Comrade Zhang Xiushan's lectures. Everyone felt that it was very helpful.

Thanks to the above many tasks, the teacher problem, which had always been considered difficult to solve, has been preliminarily solved. Naturally, the teaching level of many teachers is still very insufficient, and the problem of improving teaching quality still requires long-term efforts.

Institutions, Tutoring, and Learning Systems
First of all, spare-time party schools should establish certain institutions. Although spare-time party schools do not need to have as complete an organization as regular schools, precisely because theoretical learning for cadres in the past and in organs has often been in a state of no one being responsible (or nominally the learning committee or branch is responsible, but in fact no one specifically cares), spare-time party schools must gradually establish certain institutions and have someone specifically in charge, so that it can persist. The intermediate and elementary spare-time party schools in Shenyang City have a principal, a director of teaching affairs, and a secretary each. One-third of the spare-time party schools have also set up deputies. The principal mainly mobilizes and calls for learning and solves important problems in learning, and can be concurrently held by responsible comrades of each unit. The director of teaching affairs can be concurrently held by the head of the Party committee's propaganda department. The secretary does specific affairs and should try to be a full-time person or be held by the branch propaganda and education cadre, but the person holding the concurrent position should use their main strength to do this work. At present, there are only seven full-time secretaries in the intermediate and elementary spare-time party schools, and the institutions should be gradually enriched as necessary in the future.

Secondly, tutoring work. In order to enable students to digest the courses taught by the teachers, the tutoring work of the branch is very important. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee's draft plan for cadre education in March 1951, Party organizations in each unit have regarded leading cadres' theoretical learning as a regular task, and one of the general branch secretaries or deputy secretaries is specifically responsible for leading it. According to a survey of seventeen units, the branch's tutoring mainly plays the role of supervision, inspection, and reflecting the situation. A few can help students with auxiliary classes, answer certain questions, or organize discussions in conjunction with the actual situation and ideological problems of the organs. Tutors who enter the teacher training class generally play a greater role in tutoring. Therefore, it is wrong to no longer care after a tutor is hired, and they must be helped and improved in order to enable them to play a greater role.

Thirdly, establish and adhere to necessary learning systems. The established systems for school advancement, transfer, suspension, demotion, examinations, and graduation all have a certain promoting effect on learning. In particular, the examination system can not only promote review and further digest the teaching content, but also check the teaching effect and improve teaching leadership. The summer test held in July and August 1951 first raised discussion questions (these questions were as related as possible to actual work and thinking), gave a month for general review, and announced that the questions for the test would be drawn from the discussion questions later. The elementary spare-time party schools adopted the method of drawing questions for oral answers, and the intermediate spare-time party schools adopted the method of drawing questions for written answers. The advantage of this test method is that it gives everyone a chance to generally review the courses taught, and because the questions can be related to reality, it guides students out of the circle of books and prevents the dogmatic learning method of memorizing and copying books. From review to testing, learning is very intense. At this time, all the relevant reference books in the library are borrowed, and people are talking about learning issues in the dining hall, cinema, theater, during rest, and while taking a walk. Some people are still studying until midnight. Therefore, the appropriate use of the test system can have a very good effect.

Two Issues
First, the level of cadres participating in learning varies, which affects the teaching effect and cadres' learning enthusiasm. Taking the statistics of cadres from three spare-time party schools, such as the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Nan District, as an example, those whose education level only reaches elementary school account for about one-third. Due to the low education level and lack of basic knowledge in various aspects, it is very difficult to learn. Some people say that they "don't understand" in class and "can't chew" in self-study. Some people say, "If there were a cultural school, I would definitely go to learn culture." However, some cadres with higher education levels feel that learning political common sense is too low, are not satisfied with the teachers' general lectures, and require new things to be taught. Some people have also spontaneously organized themselves to study the courses of the intermediate spare-time party school. These situations show that cadres with elementary and junior high school levels should focus on remedial culture, and appropriately teach some simple political common sense in cultural learning. Some cadres with high education levels and a solid foundation in political common sense should be absorbed into the intermediate spare-time party school. In order to solve this problem, the Municipal Party Committee plans to run three or four more intermediate spare-time party schools. For cadres who need to focus on remedial culture, since there are only three cultural spare-time schools (2,810 people) in the city at present, which are far from meeting the needs of cadres, the Municipal Party Committee plans to gradually run a large number of cultural spare-time schools in 1953 to strengthen the cultural learning of this group of cadres.

Second, the issues of funding, housing, and full-time cadres for spare-time party schools should be further resolved. At present, there are only seven full-time secretaries in the seventy-seven spare-time party schools, and the rest are part-time, which naturally affects the improvement of work. In addition, the issues of classroom rent, libraries, winter heating equipment, and lack of tables and chairs must also be appropriately resolved.

    沈阳市七十七个业余党校是怎样办起来的
    中共沈阳市委宣传部
    简略的情况
    沈阳市的干部业余党校已发展到七十七所，全市参加初级和中级理论学习的干部大部分都在其中学习。举办干部业余党校，就能使干部政治理论的学习缺少组织性的情况得到很大的改变。
    从一九四八年沈阳解放到一九五一年，在职干部学习方式主要是由各机关组织干部自修，并辅以大报告和听广播。当时的学习内容主要是基础的政治教育，并结合学习党的政策。到了一九五一年，干部思想水平已有一定提高，以前那种全体干部学同一种课程、听同一个报告的方式，已不能适合干部不同的要求了。可是，各种工作和群众运动很紧迫，又加上许多干部对学习的意义认识不够，干部的学习情况是时紧时松，时断时续。
    沈阳市委为了加强马克思列宁主义的理论教育，以适应经济建设和工作发展的需要，研究了一九五一年中央关于加强干部教育的指示和东北局的指示，决定开办业余党校。在开办之前，市委针对着许多干部忽视政治、忙于事务的经验主义倾向做了批评，规定各部门党的负责干部必须重视干部政治理论学习的领导。沈阳市委和各级党委进行了深入的思想动员，又经过较充分的具体准备（训练教员、编组、编印教材等）之后，在一九五一年五月正式成立业余党校。当时参加学习的有二五一○○名党与非党干部。沈阳市业余党校的特点之一，就是学校基本上按照生产单位或机关设立的，尽量不使各机关合办，这样可以根据各单位的具体情况进行教学。
    一九五一年十月为了配合整党运动，初、中两级业余党校由学习社会发展史、政治常识转入学习共产党员标准的八项条件。三反运动中理论学习暂时停止，业余党校暂停工作。三反以后，干部要求学习政治理论的情绪普遍高涨，到去年九月上旬业余党校已陆续恢复，并有了发展。目前全市共有业余党校七十七所，学员二九六五○人（占全市干部总数七一三六七人的百分之四十一）。其中中级业余党校三所：计市委一所，七三四人，市政府一所，五八八人，市总工会一所（包括各群众团体干部和企业干部），四二六人。以上三校共一七四八人。初级业余党校七四所，分布于市级机关的一四所，六九○九人；工厂三十所，一二三○一人；各区三十所，八八九二人；共二八一○二人。
    根据一九五一年试办的经验和这次恢复后的反映证明，采取业余党校的形式组织一般干部进行理论学习是一种有效的方式，并受到干部普遍的欢迎。大家说：“自从办了业余党校，学习能够经常进行，不像过去那样‘三起三落’了。”“学习有制度了，正规了。”“能够循序渐进，真正能系统地学点东西了。”“有教师按期讲课，不像以前只靠小组讨论收效很慢了。”事实已经证明，这种方式是值得加以坚持和推广的。
    领导机关的关心和支持起了
        巨大的作用
    沈阳市委及各级党组织的重视和具体领导是搞好业余党校的重要关键。
    沈阳市委把领导在职干部的政治理论学习作为一项主要的工作任务，并且规定各部门党的负责干部必须把领导政治理论学习和加强自己的学习做为主要任务之一。沈阳市委把各级干部的政治理论学习问题正式提到市委会议上研究和讨论。市委的负责同志，如以前的第一书记凯丰同志和第二书记兼市长黄欧东同志都很关怀干部理论学习工作。业余党校开课以后，市委和各单位负责干部，亲自领导学习或给教员讲课。市委秘书长亲自兼任中级业余党校的校长。他们和市委委员、市级局处长等七十多高级干部都担任了教员或学习顾问。这些负责干部无论讲课或解答问题，都认真准备。
    一九五一年业余党校开办时，沈阳市委批准了十一亿人民币的经费，并建立了供市委委员理论学习使用的图书馆、资料室，和各区和市级机关的十个小型图书馆。去年九月为恢复各业余党校，又批准了四亿人民币的预算。凯丰和黄欧东两同志提出“要尽量地足够地供给干部学习所必需的书籍。”为了保证干部学习时间，市委规定除每日两小时的学习时间外，又保证执行东北人民政府所规定的星期三午后为学习日的制度，在这一时间内不召开任何会议。市委又针对工厂企业的工作情况，将工厂会议，党、政、工、团的活动做了较具体的规定。
    各级党的组织也帮助业余党校解决了各种困难，如化学制药厂、市政企业管理局、五三工厂，帮助干部解决上课时的交通、吃饭时间、经费等具体困难。这就更鼓舞了干部的学习情绪。
        教员问题是怎样解决的
    业余党校能否开办，或能否收到良好的教学效果，关键之一是能否组织到有一定数量和质量水平较好的教员。只要有了足够数量能胜任的教员，业余党校才有了坚持下去的巩固的基础。
    由于沈阳是东北局所在地，干部比较集中，因而也具备了解决教员困难的有利条件。市委除要求东北局协助聘请教员外，并规定担任教员是一切具有一定理论水平的党员干部不可推诿的责任。市委规定担任教员即是完成党的工作。这样，就解决了教员问题，组织了足够的教员来满足七十多个学校的需要。市委在组织教员的日常工作和帮助教员教学方面，还采取了以下的许多办法：
    一、市级负责干部组成的讲师，专给中级业余党校讲课。这些负责同志很忙，但是每一个教员在半年中只讲一两次课，而且在早两三个月前通知，这样，这些负责同志仍可能担任讲师。由于讲师团人数少，就联合各机关办联合的大业余党校。同时为了帮助这些负责同志进行备课，市委宣传部设立的学习室（原来是理论研究组）根据课程的内容写出供教员参考的简要讲授提纲。其中包括讲授重点、解决几个什么主要问题，批判什么、联系什么。学习室还指出主要的与一般的参考书，并具体指明讲某一问题参考书的章节。其次，向教员介绍学生的水平及思想情况、预习中所发生的疑难和争论的问题，有时还介绍些教员讲课的方法和经验。再次，要求教员在课前写详细的通俗提纲，交市委宣传部审查。最后，是在教员讲课的一两周前召开教员会议。会中先由教员报告准备如何讲授，然后进行讨论，以帮助教员进一步改进教课质量。经过这些过程，就可以缩短教员备课时间，帮助他们明确教学重点，并能保证内容的正确性。许多教员感到这样做对自己很有帮助。
    二、办好教员训练班，培养理论常识与政治常识教员。参加这一训练班学习的学员，主要是不能独立备课或备课有困难的业余党校的教员。训练班还吸收青年团员与群众中优秀的学习积极分子参加。每星期日上午或每星期三下午集中在市委礼堂上课。教员训练班的作用已证明是极大的，它可以帮助许多教员一面提高自己，一面进行教课，实行
    “边学边教”的方法。有一部分同志经过学习，也可把辅导工作担负得更好。一九五二年全市参加教员训练班的共七一八人，其中教员三五六人，辅导员三六二人；党员干部六六五人，非党干部五三人。经过训练后，一般同志对担任教员工作增强了信心。这一训练班还培养出了一些优秀的青年讲师，这是很重要的收获。
    三、把全市四二八名教员组成一个教育网，集中使用，统一分配。这对提高教学效果有重要的意义。虽然各工厂企业、机关、学校都各自聘请了一些教员，但由于各部门干部条件不同，教员的数量质量相差很大。一般机关要强于工厂，而大机关又强于小机关。因此，将教员集中使用，统一调配，就能解决某些单位教员数量少，质量低的困难。就教员的使用说，因此可以更有计划性。例如不必由教员准备某一课程的全部内容，而由几个教员分别担任某几章节，某一教员可以专门讲授某一章，采用巡回讲课的方法，以收分工合作的功效。这样就可以减轻备课的负担，并便于积累经验。
    四、经常供给教员学习资料。加强教员研究工作。
    一九五一年市委宣传部编印了与编写了参考材料四十种，参考提纲二十八种，一九五二年编写和印发了参考提纲二十种，参考资料八种。此外还给教员订阅“学习译丛”、“学习”杂志、“学习初级版”等。
    在教学研究工作方面，举行过三次教学经验介绍大会，两次教学观摩会，并组织教员观摩张秀山同志讲课。大家感到帮助很大。
    由于以上许多工作，使得一向认为很难解决的教员问题得到了初步的解决。自然，许多教员的教学水平还很不够，提高教学质量的问题还待长期的努力。
    机构、辅导和学习制度
    首先，业余党校应设立一定的机构。业余党校固然不必有像正规学校那样完备的组织，但正因为过去和机关干部理论学习经常处于无人负责的状态（或者名义上由学委会或支部负责，但实际上无专人过问），所以业余党校必须逐渐设立一定的机构，有人专司其事，才能使它坚持下去。沈阳市中、初两级业余党校均设校长、教导主任、秘书各一人，有三分之一的业余党校还设了副职。校长主要是动员号召学习与解决学习中的重要问题，可由各单位负责同志兼任。教务主任可由党委宣传部长兼任。秘书是作具体事务的，应尽量设专任的，或由支部宣教干事担任，但兼任者要以主要力量来做这一工作。现在中、初级业余党校中仅有专职的秘书七名，今后应逐渐把机构作必要的充实。
    其次是辅导工作。为了使学员把教员讲授的课程加以消化，支部的辅导工作是很重要的。各单位的党组织根据市委一九五一年三月干部教育草案指示，已把领导干部的理论学习当做经常工作之一，并由总支书记或副书记一人专门负责领导。据十七个单位调查，支部的辅导主要可起督促检查和反映情况的作用，少数能帮助学员上辅助课、解答某些问题或结合机关实际情况与思想问题组织讨论。进入教员训练班学习的辅导员，一般在辅导中作用较大。所以，聘定了辅导员就不再过问是不对的，必须帮助他们、提高他们，才能使他们起更大的作用。
    其三，建立与坚持必要的学习制度。现已建立的升学、转学、休学、降级、考试、毕业等制度，对学习都有一定的推动作用。特别是考试制度，既能推动复习，进一步消化讲授内容；并能检查教学效果，藉以改进教学领导。一九五一年七八月举行的暑期测验，先提出讨论题（这些题尽可能的与实际工作和思想相联系），给予一个月的总复习时间，并宣布以后即从讨论题中出题测验。初级业余党校，采取抽题口答办法，中级业余党校采取抽题笔答办法。这样测验方式的好处是使大家对所讲课程有一个总复习机会，并由于题目能联系实际，因而就引导学员跳出了书本的圈子，防止了背书、抄书的教条主义的学习方法。从复习到测验，学习是非常紧张的，这时图书馆有关参考书都借完了，不管在饭堂、影院、戏院、休息和散步都在谈论着学习的问题，有的人直到午夜还在学习。因此，测验制度的适当运用，能起很好的效果。
    两个问题
    第一、参加学习的干部的水平参差不齐，影响到教学效果和干部的学习情绪。试举市总工会及南市区等三个业余党校的干部统计，文化程度只达到小学水平的均占三分之一左右，由于文化程度低，各方面的基础知识缺乏，因而学习起来很吃力。有的人说上课“听不懂”，自修“啃不动”。有的人说“要有文化学校，我就一定去学文化”。但另一些文化程度高的少数干部则又感到学政治常识太低，对教员一般的讲授不满意，要求讲新鲜东西。也有一些人自动组织起来学习中级业余党校课程的。这些情况说明了初中以下程度的干部应以补习文化为主，在文化学习中适当地讲一些简明的政治常识。对一些文化程度高并确实具有政治常识基础的干部，应吸收到中级业余党校来。为了解决这一问题，市委拟再办三、四个中级业余党校。对需要以补习文化为主的干部，由于目前全市仅有文化业余学校三所（二八一○人），远不能满足干部的需要，市委拟于一九五三年逐步大量的举办文化业余学校，加强这批干部的文化学习。
    第二、业余党校的经费、房屋和专职干部问题应进一步解决。现在七十七所业余党校仅有专职秘书七人，其余都是兼职，这自然影响工作的改进。又上课的教室租金、图书室、冬季取暖设备和桌椅缺少等问题也须适当解决。
