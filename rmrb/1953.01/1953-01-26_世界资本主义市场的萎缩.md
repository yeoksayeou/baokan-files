The Shrinking of the World Capitalist Market
By I. Dukinsky and F. Arkhimov, Soviet Union

Comrade Stalin pointed out in his new classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that the disintegration of the unified world market determines the further deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system.

As early as 1927, Comrade Stalin instructed us that the market issue is a fundamental issue of modern capitalism. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report to the 15th Party Congress: "The intensification of the problem of the general sales market, especially the problem of the foreign market, especially the problem of the capital export market—this is the current situation of capitalism." ("Complete Works of Stalin," Russian edition, Volume 10, page 275.)

After World War II, the problem of commodity sales became a more acute issue in capitalist society. The scope of capitalist exploitation has shrunk dramatically. China and the People's Democratic countries of Europe broke away from the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, formed a unified and powerful socialist camp, which is opposed to the imperialist camp. The economic result of the existence of two opposing camps is the disintegration of the unified and all-encompassing world market, thereby forming two mutually opposing world markets. As Stalin pointed out, this disintegration is the most important economic result of World War II.

The End of Relative Stability of the Capitalist Market

The emergence of a new parallel world market, namely the market of the socialist camp countries, has caused extremely significant changes in international trade. The attempts by the United States, Britain, and France to strangle this new world market have completely failed. In fact, not only did they fail to strangle it, but they also consolidated the new world market. As for the capitalist market, its possibilities for activity have been reduced, and the relative stability it had before World War II has ended.

Due to the disintegration of the unified world market, the scope of the major capitalist countries (the United States, Britain, and France) to seize world resources has been sharply reduced, the capacity of the capitalist countries' markets has shrunk, the field of investment has narrowed, and the phenomenon of undercapacity operation of enterprises in these countries continues to expand.

At present, the total volume of foreign trade of capitalist countries is almost the same as it was twenty years ago. At the same time, the development of foreign trade in capitalist countries has an extremely unbalanced nature. When the monopoly capitalists of the United States, taking advantage of the weakness of their competitors after the war, seized most of the world capitalist market and were able to increase their commodity exports in 1951 by double compared to 1937, the export volume of Belgium, Sweden, Brazil and several other countries remained at the level of 1937. India's export volume in 1951 was almost only one-third of that in 1937, and Argentina's and Myanmar's export volume in 1951 was more than half lower than that in 1937.

In the new world market, namely the market of the democratic camp countries, the situation is completely different. This market includes: the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic. The residents of these countries account for one-third of the world's population. The countries of the socialist camp have been economically integrated and have established fraternal cooperation. The basis of this cooperation is mutual assistance to develop productivity and a sincere desire to seek common economic upswing. At the same time, it is important to emphasize the fact that the Soviet Union, which leads the democratic and socialist camp, is a powerful industrial country. Not only can it successfully develop without importing industrial equipment and machinery from capitalist countries, but it also supplies these commodities to friendly countries in large quantities. The Soviet Union's supply of the latest equipment and machinery to the People's Democratic countries has increased ninefold in the past five years. Thanks to the extremely cheap and technically first-class assistance provided by the Soviet Union to the People's Democratic countries, the speed of production in these countries is increasing year after year.

The economies of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are constantly developing. This economy has no economic crisis of overproduction. Its development is to maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society, ensure a systematic increase in the living standards of the people, and ensure full employment of the labor force.

Mutual trade between the countries of the socialist camp is an important part of their planned economy. Commodity circulation in the new world market is developing according to plan. It is not affected by the inherent crises, anarchy and market fluctuations in the foreign trade of capitalist countries. Therefore, the capacity of the new world market and the export possibilities of the friendly countries participating in this market are constantly expanding year after year. From 1948 to 1952, the volume of commodity circulation between democratic countries increased more than twofold. In the first nine months of 1952, the volume of commodity circulation between European People's Democratic countries in the new world market increased by 24 percent compared to the same period in 1951.

The production of all countries in the socialist camp is increasing at a high speed without exception, which is one of the main reasons for the continuous expansion of the volume of commodity circulation in the new world market.

Comrade Stalin pointed out in his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "It can be said with confidence that at such a high speed of industrial development, these countries will soon not only not need to import goods from capitalist countries, but they themselves will feel the need to export their surplus goods to other countries."

The impoverishment of the masses is shrinking the market capacity left to capitalism

The reduction in the scope of commodity sales in capitalist countries due to the emergence of a new world market is not enough to summarize the intensification of the problem of sales markets in the capitalist camp.

The problem is that the characteristic of modern capitalist economy is that the relations of production are significantly contradictory to the nature of the productive forces. This contradiction is manifested in the intensification of economic decay, the increase in the destructive effect of economic crises, the militarization of industry, the intensification of competition, the enslavement of some countries by other countries, and the continuous deepening of the poverty of the masses. And these all mean the further disintegration of modern capitalism.

The destructive effect of the basic economic law of capitalism has been strengthened. Therefore, the development of the capitalist economy is not conducive to society, but only to ensure that capitalists obtain maximum profits. Imperialists strive to ensure that maximum profits are obtained, thereby strengthening the exploitation and plunder of the people of various dependent countries, which inevitably leads to a reduction in the capacity of the already narrowed world market left to capitalism.

An important factor in reducing the capacity of the world capitalist market is the fundamental deterioration of commodity sales conditions in imperialist countries. Due to the increasing impoverishment of the masses, who are ultimately the basic purchasers, the contradiction between the level of capitalist production, which hopes to obtain maximum profits, and the low level of purchasing power becomes more acute. Now, the poverty of the broad masses of the people has reached such a degree that even the official statistics of the bourgeoisie cannot cover it up. In France and Italy, the real wages of workers in 1952 were less than half of what they were before the war, and in Britain, they were 20 percent lower than before the war. The masses of people in imperialist countries are unable to purchase the most necessary consumer goods.

The existence of large-scale unemployment is also accelerating the decline in the purchasing power of the working people. At present, in the United States, Britain, West Germany, Italy, and Japan alone, there are nearly 32 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people.

The low level of purchasing power not only deteriorates sales conditions in imperialist countries, but also limits the possibility of import trade in imperialist countries.

Another important factor in reducing the capacity of the capitalist market is the reduction in the sales of goods in colonies and dependent countries. When pursuing maximum profits, imperialists have intensified the enslavement and plunder of the people in these countries. In India, Indonesia, Iran, and various countries in Africa, millions of people live on the verge of starvation, and millions of people have already starved to death. The result of the brutal exploitation of colonies and dependent countries by imperialists has hindered the development of productive forces in these countries, and the purchasing power of residents has plummeted.

Here is a representative example. The American monopoly capitalists rampant in Saudi Arabia make more than six times the profit from mining each ton of oil than they spend mining it. However, the total amount of money that the workers directly involved in mining oil at the mining site receive from the monopoly capitalists in the form of wages is less than 2 percent of the oil price, and the remaining 98 percent is stuffed into the capitalists' pockets!

According to the statistics on the world economic situation for 1949-50 published by the United Nations Secretariat, the national income of countries accounting for almost one-third of the world's population (including the people of Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, Ecuador, Abyssinia, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and other dependent countries) is less than 5 percent of the total world income.

The unscrupulous plunder of colonies and dependent countries by a small group of imperialist countries has further reduced the capacity of the world capitalist market. Africa, with a population of 198 million, has a much smaller commodity import volume than Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, which have a total population of 23 million. India and Pakistan, with a population of 470 million, import only the equivalent of one Switzerland's commodity import volume, but Switzerland has only one percent of the residents of India and Pakistan.

The intensified oppression of colonies by imperialism in the post-war period has led to a further sharpening of contradictions between colonies and suzerain states and a surge in the national liberation struggles of oppressed nations. All of this will inevitably make it more and more difficult for imperialists to sell goods and export capital in colonies and dependent countries.

The sharp decline in the purchasing power of the broad masses of the people in capitalist countries will inevitably lead to a reduction in the quantity of consumer goods in foreign trade. The International Food Committee of the United Nations admitted in its 1950-1951 report: "Most of the people who were on the verge of starvation before the war are in a worse situation today," and pointed out: "Compared with the pre-war level, the world food trade volume has been reduced by almost one-third."

The arms race exacerbates the difficulty of sales

As Comrade Stalin pointed out, imperialists are trying to use the "Marshall Plan," the war of aggression against Korea, the arms race, and the militarization of industry to compensate for the difficulties suffered by the capitalist economy due to the disintegration of the unified world market. But this is like a drowning person grabbing at a straw.

Militarization has expanded the trade in weapons, strategic raw materials, and equipment needed for military factories. This one-sided development of foreign trade is not related to the normal process of reproduction. In the capitalist camp, more and more finished products and raw materials are consumed in unproductive military consumption or accumulated in the form of large strategic reserves. This prosperity that has been achieved will not last long, because militarization, which is linked to a large amount of unproductive consumption and a sharp decline in the purchasing power of the masses, is destroying the economy of capitalist countries and is deteriorating the possibility of commodity sales in domestic and foreign markets.

In fact, the slight increase in the foreign trade volume of capitalist countries, which was achieved on the basis of the increase in arms trade in 1950, is extremely unstable and not solid. Some figures indicate that the foreign trade volume of capitalist countries has begun to shrink since the end of 1951.

The trade volume of civilian goods has been reduced particularly severely. For example, in the United States, as "Fortune" magazine pointed out, from January to July 1952, the export of civilian consumer goods fell by 35 percent.

Due to the imperialist countries' pursuit of militarism and aggression, and their self-isolation from the world democratic market, it has deepened the commodity sales difficulties they are suffering. The United States has torn up the trade agreements it previously signed with various democratic countries, and has, in fact, prohibited the countries dependent on it from trading with the countries of the socialist camp.

The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France intend to use such policies to undermine the economic development of the countries of the socialist camp. However, their wishful thinking has failed. The economy of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is steadily rising and strengthening. On this basis, the world democratic market is being further consolidated. However, in imperialist countries, this policy has made the market problem more acute, further expanded the phenomenon of undercapacity operation of industrial institutions, and led to a further increase in the unemployment ranks and a decline in mass purchasing power.

The deterioration of commodity sales conditions in the capitalist market has already caused a reduction in production in capitalist countries. In the United States, the most powerful capitalist country, the total level of industrial production in the first nine months of 1952 was nearly 3 percent lower than in the same period in 1951; in Britain, it was nearly 5 percent lower; in Belgium, it was more than 4 percent lower; in Denmark, it was 5 percent lower. In the production sectors that produce consumer goods for the working people, the production volume has fallen particularly sharply.

Facts have proved that the arms expansion policy pursued by the imperialist camp is deepening the difficulties and contradictions that are sufficient to split this camp every day, and is leading it to an economic crisis. The rise in the production of military industrial sectors has not been able to compensate for the fall in production in the peace industrial sectors. The reduction in production has already encompassed these sectors in heavy industry, such as the chemical industry, the machine manufacturing industry, and part of the metallurgical industry. In the first half of 1952, the total amount of orders received by the American processing industry decreased by 17 billion US dollars compared to the same period in 1951, which is a decrease of 10 percent.

Reality has shattered the theories of bourgeois apologists, who asserted that it seems that "crisis-free development" of the capitalist economy can be guaranteed by means of arms expansion. Due to the growth of economic difficulties, the tone of panic in bourgeois newspapers is becoming more and more intense. The bulletin of one of the five major banks in Britain, "Westminster Bank," wrote: "At present, the entire world economy, especially the British economy, is more vulnerable to the forces of crisis than it was only a year ago."

The struggle for markets among imperialist plunderers is becoming increasingly acute

The struggle for foreign markets among imperialists is becoming more and more brutal. Striving to expand the sales of their commodities in foreign markets, imperialist countries have used all the means of trade wars: adopting various methods to restrict imports, implementing export subsidies, establishing high tariffs that prohibit commodity imports, and selling their commodities in foreign markets at auction prices (dumping).

The struggle between the United States and Britain for sales markets is the most intense.

Although British capitalists are struggling desperately to expand the export trade volume of their commodities, Britain's role in world trade is shrinking. The proportion of Britain's export trade volume in the total world export trade of capitalist countries has fallen from 10.7 percent in 1937 to 9.4 percent in 1951. In the same period, the proportion of the United States rose from 13.4 percent to 19.4 percent. Using dumping and other trade war methods, American imperialists have even pushed Britain out of its traditional market.

In the struggle against British competitors, American imperialists have utilized the monopoly capitalists of West Germany and Japan, who are fostered by them. The latter are transporting commodities in large quantities into the market that Britain once considered its inherent market. Thus, in the first half of 1952, the total amount of cotton fabrics and rayon fabrics that Japan exported to the countries of the British Empire exceeded the amount that Britain itself exported to these countries.

However, British monopoly capitalists are unwilling to give up their traditional market without resistance. They are launching a tenacious struggle to oppose the arbitrary power of the United States in international trade, and are making more stubborn efforts to preserve and consolidate its position in the British Empire market. The British Empire Federal Prime Ministers' Conference, which was held in London not long ago, was for this purpose. At this conference, British imperialism attempted to unite the autonomous territories around Britain, thereby resisting American expansion.

While the contradiction between Britain and the United States—the main contradiction in the imperialist camp—is intensifying, the contradictions between the United States and other capitalist countries, especially the United States and France, the United States and some defeated countries (West Germany, Japan, Italy), are also sharpening. These countries cannot endure the rule and oppression of the United States forever. Their attempts to break free from American enslavement and restart independent life will be increasingly strengthened.

American imperialists have carried out a frantic struggle to seize foreign sales markets, and prohibit the entry of other countries' commodities into their own domestic market. It attempts to use this method to alleviate the difficulties in the American domestic economy. It is enough to point out the following: The average annual export volume of the United States in the post-war period is 12.5 billion US dollars, while the average import volume is only 7.3 billion US dollars, which means that the United States' annual export balance exceeds 5 billion US dollars.

However, the unlimited expansion implemented by American imperialism has not solved the domestic economic contradictions in the United States, but has instead led to further chaos in the world capitalist market. Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report to the 19th Party Congress: "American imperialism is now not only an international exploiter and enslaver of the people of all countries, but also a force that destroys the economies of the remaining capitalist countries." As a result of the United States' expansion in foreign markets, the trade balance of capitalist countries has generated a constant imbalance, and the US dollars needed to pay for imported goods from the United States are even more lacking. According to the statistics of the European Economic Cooperation Organization, the dollar deficit of Western European countries in 1951-1952 was 1.7 billion US dollars, and this year it will increase to 3-4 billion US dollars. Therefore, Western European countries are only forced to either reduce the number of imports, or pay for imported goods with gold, thereby depleting their own gold reserves.

American imperialists are formulating plans to further enslave their satellite countries. More than 2,000 representatives of the largest monopoly capitalists in the United States—that is, the participants in the "National Foreign Trade Conference" held in New York not long ago—have formulated the United States' new expansion plan. This robber plan of American imperialism stipulates that it will deprive the countries dependent on American imperialism of their sovereignty, ensure that American monopoly capital can freely enter the areas of raw material production and various investments, and eliminate all economic barriers that hinder the United States from seizing new markets.

It is very obvious that the implementation of this plundering program will be met with fierce resistance from Britain and other American cronies in the Atlantic aggressive bloc, and will also be met with fierce resistance from colonies and dependent countries.

Everyday facts prove with ruthless logic that due to the disintegration of the unified world market in the post-war period, the contradictions inherent in the capitalist economy have become more acute. The struggle between imperialist countries has become more intense. The contradiction between the relations of production and the nature of productive forces has reached such a degree that the capitalist system as an economic system can no longer have the prospect of a general economic upswing. Compared with the pre-war period, the world system of the entire capitalist economy is much narrower, weaker, and more unstable.

    世界资本主义市场的萎缩
    苏联  伊·杜金斯基  弗·阿尔希莫夫
    斯大林同志在他的新的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出，统一的世界市场的瓦解，决定了世界资本主义体系总危机的进一步加深。
    还在一九二七年，斯大林同志就指示我们说，市场问题是现代资本主义的基本问题。斯大林同志在党的十五次代表大会的报告中指出：“一般销售市场问题的尖锐化，特别是国外市场问题、尤其是资本输出市场问题的尖锐化——这就是资本主义现今的情形。”（“斯大林全集”俄文版第一○卷，第二七五页。）
    在第二次世界大战以后，商品销售问题成为资本主义社会更为尖锐的问题。资本主义剥削的范围急遽地缩小了。中国和欧洲的各人民民主国家脱离了资本主义体系，和苏联一起形成了统一的和强大的社会主义阵营，而与帝国主义阵营相对立。两个对立阵营存在之经济结果，就是统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解，从而形成了两个互相对立的世界市场。正如斯大林所指出，这个瓦解是第二次世界大战在经济方面的最重要的结果。
    资本主义市场相对稳定的终结
    新的平行的世界市场的出现，即社会主义阵营国家市场的出现，引起了国际贸易方面的极重大的变化。美国、英国、法国想窒杀这个新的世界市场的企图完全失败了。事实上不仅没有窒杀得了，反而巩固了新的世界市场。至于资本主义市场，则它的活动的可能性缩小了，它在第二次世界大战以前所有的相对稳定性已经结束。
    由于统一的世界市场的瓦解，急遽地缩小了各主要资本主义国家（美、英、法）攫取世界资源的范围，资本主义国家市场的容量萎缩，投资领域缩小，而这些国家的企业开工不足的现象则继续扩大。
    目前资本主义国家的对外贸易总额，与二十年以前的水平相差无几。同时在资本主义国家对外贸易的发展中，具有极度不平衡的性质。当美国的垄断资本家，趁着战后自己的竞争者削弱的机会，夺取了世界资本主义市场的极大部分，并能以此使得其一九五一年的商品出口额比一九三七年增大一倍的时候，比利时、瑞典、巴西及其他若干国家的出口额却仍旧停滞在一九三七年的水平上下。印度在一九五一年的出口额差不多只有一九三七年的三分之一，阿根廷和缅甸在一九五一年的出口额比一九三七年低落了一半以上。
    在新的世界市场、即民主阵营国家市场上，情形却完全不同。这个市场所包括的成员是：苏联，中华人民共和国，波兰，捷克斯洛伐克，匈牙利，罗马尼亚，保加利亚，阿尔巴尼亚，德意志民主共和国，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，蒙古人民共和国。这些国家的居民，占全世界人口的三分之一。社会主义阵营各个国家在经济上已经结合起来，并且建立好了兄弟般的合作。这个合作的基础是互相帮助以发展生产力和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。同时，重要的是必须强调指出这一事实，即领导民主和社会主义阵营的苏联是一个强大的工业国家。它不仅能不需要资本主义国家进口的工业装备和机器而成功地发展，而且，它自己还把这些商品大量供应各友好国家。苏联供给人民民主国家的最新构造的装备和机器，在最近五年中，增加了九倍。由于有了苏联给予人民民主国家以极度便宜的和技术上的头等的帮助，这些国家的生产速度正在年复一年地提高着。
    苏联和人民民主国家的经济正在不断地发展。这种经济没有生产过剩的经济危机。它的发展是为了最大限度地满足社会的物质和文化的需要，保证有系统地提高人民群众的生活水平和保证劳动力的充分就业。
    社会主义阵营各国间的相互贸易，是它们的计划经济的重要组成部分。新的世界市场上的商品流通是按着计划发展的。它不受资本主义国家对外贸易中有机地固有的危机、无政府状态和行情的波动所影响。因此，新的世界市场的容量，以及参加这个市场的各友好国家的出口可能性，年复一年地不断扩大。从一九四八年到一九五二年，民主国家之间的商品流通额增加了二倍以上。在一九五二年头九个月这段时间内，欧洲人民民主国家之间在新的世界市场上的商品流通额，与一九五一年度同一时期相比，增加了百分之二十四。
    社会主义阵营内各个国家的生产，都无例外地以快速度增加着，这就是新的世界市场上商品流通额不断扩大的主要原因之一。
    斯大林同志在其著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出：“可以满怀信心地说，在这样高的工业发展速度之下，很快就会使得这些国家不仅不需要从资本主义国家输入商品，而且它们自己还会感到必须把自己生产的多余商品输往他国。”
    人民群众的贫困化正在缩减留给资本主义的市场的容量
    因新的世界市场的出现而使资本主义国家商品销售范围缩小，还不足以概括资本主义阵营中销售市场问题的尖锐化。
    问题在于，现代资本主义经济的特征是生产关系显著地与生产力的性质相抵触。这种抵触表现在经济的腐朽性的加剧，经济危机的破坏作用的增加，工业的军事化，竞争的剧烈和一些国家奴役其他国家，以及人民群众的贫穷不断加深等方面。而这些都意味着现代资本主义的更进一步的解体。
    资本主义基本经济法则的破坏作用已经在加强，因此，资本主义经济的发展已不利于社会，而只有利于保证资本家获得最大限度的利润。帝国主义者力图使最大限度的利润获得保证，因而加强剥削和掠夺各附属国家的人民，这就不可避免地导致剩给资本主义的那个已经缩小了的世界市场的容量的缩减。
    缩小世界资本主义市场容量的重要因素，是帝国主义国家内商品销售条件的根本恶化。由于那些终归是基本购买者的人民群众的日益贫困化，于是，指望获取最大限度利润的资本主义的生产水平与购买力的低下水平之间的矛盾，就更加尖锐了。现在，广大人民群众的贫困已达到如此程度，以致资产阶级的官方统计也无法加以掩饰。在法国和意大利，一九五二年工人的实际工资不到战前的一半，在英国则比战前减少了百分之二十。帝国主义国家的人民群众已无力购买生活最必需的消费品。
    大量失业现象的存在，也加速着劳动人民购买力的跌落。目前，仅仅在美国、英国、西德、意大利和日本，失业和半失业的就差不多近三千二百万人。
    购买力的低下水平不仅恶化了帝国主义国家内的销售条件，而且也限制了帝国主义国家的进口贸易的可能性。
    缩小资本主义市场容量的另一个重要因素，是殖民地和附属国内商品销路的缩小。帝国主义者在追逐最大限度利润的时候，更加加紧了对这些国家人民的奴役和掠夺。在印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗和非洲的各个国家内，千百万人民都生活在饿死的边缘，并且已有数百万人民被饿死。帝国主义者对殖民地和附属国残暴剥削的结果，阻碍了这些国家生产力的发展，而居民的购买力则急遽下跌。
    这里是一个代表性的例子。横行于沙特阿拉伯的美国垄断资本家们，开采每一吨石油，所获得的利润超过了他们开采这一吨石油费用的六倍。但是，在开采场中直接从事开采石油的工人们以工资的形式从垄断资本家手中所取得的全部总和，却不到石油售价的百分之二，其余的百分之九十八就是这样由资本家塞到自己的荷包中去了！
    按照联合国秘书处所发表的一九四九年—五○年度的世界经济状况的统计数字，差不多占地球上居民三分之一的国家的国民收入（其中包括缅甸、印度尼西亚、菲律宾、厄瓜多尔、阿比西尼亚、海地、沙特阿拉伯、泰国和其他附属国的人民）少于全世界总收入的百分之五。
    一小撮帝国主义国家对殖民地和附属国进行的毫无顾忌的掠夺，进一步缩小了世界资本主义市场的容量。有一亿九千八百万居民的非洲，它的商品输入额却大大地少于人口总数为二千三百万的比利时、荷兰和瑞士的商品进口额。有四亿七千万人口的印度和巴基斯坦、它们所输入的商品数额只相当于一个瑞士的商品运入量，但瑞士的居民人数却只有印度和巴基斯坦两国居民的百分之一。
    战后时期帝国主义在殖民地的加紧压迫，导致了殖民地和宗主国之间矛盾的进一步尖锐化和被压迫的各个民族的民族解放斗争的高涨。这一切都必然使得帝国主义者在殖民地和附属国中的商品销售和资本输出的条件愈益困难。
    资本主义世界各国中广大人民群众购买力的急遽跌落，必然导致对外贸易中消费品数量的缩减。联合国所属国际粮食委员会在其一九五○年—一九五一年度的报告中，承认：“在战前即辗转于饥饿线上的大多数人民，他们今天的处境更为恶劣，”并且指出：“与战前的水平相比，世界粮食贸易额差不多削减了三分之一。”
    军备竞争加重了销售的困难
    正如斯大林同志所指出，帝国主义者竭力想用
    “马歇尔计划”、侵朝战争、军备竞争和工业军事化来弥补因统一的世界市场的瓦解而使资本主义经济所遭受的困难。但是这很像快要淹死的人抓住一根草一样。
    军国主义化扩大了对武器，战略原料和军事工厂所需装备的贸易。对外贸易的这种片面发展，与再生产的正常过程不相联系。在资本主义阵营内，越来越多的成品和原料消耗在非生产性的军事消费上，或者以大量战略储备形式积压起来。已达到的这种景气是不会维持多么长久的，因为与大量非生产性的消耗和人民群众购买力的急遽跌落联系着的军国主义化，正在破坏资本主义国家的经济，正在使国内市场和国外市场上商品销售的可能性恶化。
    事实上，在一九五零年以军火贸易的增加为基础而达到的资本主义国家对外贸易额的少许增加，表现得极不稳定和极不牢固。一些数字指出，资本主义国家的对外贸易额自一九五一年末已开始萎缩。
    缩减得特别厉害的是民用商品的贸易额。例如，在美国，正如“幸福”杂志所指出，从一九五二年一月到七月，民用消费品的输出，跌落了百分之三十五。
    由于帝国主义国家走上军国主义和侵略的道路，并自绝于世界民主市场，这就更加深了它们正在遭受着的商品销售困难。美国已撕毁了它早先与各民主主义国家所签订的贸易协定，并于事实上禁止依附于它的各国与社会主义阵营各国进行贸易。
    美国、英国和法国的统治集团打算借助于这样的政策，来破坏社会主义阵营各国的经济发展。但是，它们的如意算盘落空了。苏联和人民民主国家的经济正在稳步上升和增强着。在这一基础上，世界民主市场正在进一步的巩固着。但在帝国主义国家里，这一政策却使得市场问题更趋尖锐化，使工业机构开工不足的现象更为扩大，导致了失业队伍的进一步增多和群众购买力的下降。
    资本主义市场上商品销售条件的恶化，已经引起资本主义国家内生产的缩减。在最强大的资本主义国家的美国，一九五二年头九个月的工业生产总水平，比一九五一年同时期内差不多降低了百分之三；在英国则是差不多降低了百分之五；在比利时，降低了百分之四强；在丹麦，降低了百分之五。而在生产劳动人民消费品的生产部门，其生产额降落得特别急遽。
    事实证明，帝国主义阵营所奉行的军备扩张，每天都在加深足以分裂这个阵营的困难和矛盾，并把它导向经济危机。军事工业部门生产的上升，已经不能够补偿和平工业部门中生产的跌落。生产的缩减已经囊括了重工业内这些部门，如化学工业、机器制造工业和一部分冶金工业。在一九五二年上半年内，美国加工工业所收到的定货总额，比一九五一年同时期减少了一百七十亿美元，即减少了百分之十。
    现实生活粉碎了资产阶级辩护人的理论，这些资产阶级的辩护人肯定说借助于军备扩张，似乎就可以保证资本主义经济的“没有危机的发展”。由于经济困难的增长，在资产阶级的报纸上，惊惶的调子是愈来愈响得厉害了。英国五大银行之一“威斯特明斯特银行”的公报写道：“目前，整个世界经济，特别是英国的经济，比较仅仅一年以前所表现的可能性更容易为危机力量所创伤。”
    帝国主义掠夺者们争取市场的斗争日益尖锐化
    帝国主义者为争取国外市场而进行的斗争，愈来愈残酷了。竭力想在国外市场上扩充自己商品的销路，帝国主义国家使用了一切贸易战争的手段：采用限制进口的各种办法，实行了出口补贴，建立了禁止商品进口的高额关税，在国外市场上以拍卖的价格出售自己的商品（倾销）。
    美国和英国争夺销售市场的斗争，最为剧烈。
    虽然英国资本家拚命挣扎，以图扩大自己商品的输出贸易额，但是英国在世界贸易中所起的作用却在缩小着。英国的出口贸易额在资本主义各国的世界出口贸易总额中所占的比重，已从一九三七年的百分之一○·七，降到一九五一年的百分之九·四。而在同一时期内，美国所占的比重却从百分之十三·四上升到百分之十九·四。美帝国主义者利用倾销和其他贸易战的手段，甚至把英国从它的传统市场中排挤了出去。
    美国帝国主义者在反对英国竞争者的斗争中，利用了由其扶植起来的西德和日本的垄断资本家。后者正在把商品大量运入那曾被英国认为是它所固有的市场中去。这样，在一九五二年的上半年内，日本向不列颠帝国各个国家所输出的棉织品和人造丝织品的总额，超过了英国自己向这些国家所输出的数额。
    然而，英国的垄断资本家是不肯无抵抗地把自己的传统市场让出来的。他们正在展开顽强的斗争以反对美国在国际贸易中的专横势力，正在更加倔强地努力设法保存和巩固它在不列颠帝国市场上的地位。不久以前，在伦敦所召开的不列颠帝国联邦总理会议，就是为着这个目的。在这次会议上，英帝国主义企图把各自治领团结到英国的周围，而以此来抗御美国的扩张。
    与英美之间的矛盾——帝国主义阵营中的主要矛盾——加剧的同时，美国和其他资本主义国家，特别是美国和法国，美国和一些战败国（西德、日本、意大利）的矛盾也尖锐化起来。这些国家不能够永无终止地忍受美国的统治和压迫。它们想挣脱美国奴役和重新开始独立生活的企图，将日益加强。
    美帝国主义者为争取国外销售市场进行了狂热的斗争，并禁止其他国家的商品进入自己的国内市场，它企图以这种办法来和缓美国国内经济的困难。只要指出下列一点就够了：美国在战后时期每年平均输出额为一百二十五亿美元，而平均进口额却只有七十三亿美元，这就是说，美国每年的出口余额超过了五十亿美元。
    但美帝国主义所实行的无限度的扩张，并没有解决美国国内的经济矛盾，却反而招致了世界资本主义市场的进一步混乱。马林科夫同志在党的第十九次代表大会上的报告中指出：“美帝国主义现在不仅是各国人民的国际剥削者和奴役者，而且也是破坏其余资本主义国家经济的一种势力。”美国在国外市场上扩张的结果，使资本主义国家的贸易差额产生了经常的不平衡性，并使为支付从美国进口商品所需的美元更为缺乏。按照欧洲经济合作总署的统计，一九五一年—一九五二年度西欧各国的美元赤字是一十七亿美元，而本年度将增加到三十—四十亿美元。因此，西欧各国便只有被迫，或者削减进口数额，或者用黄金支付进口商品，从而枯竭其本国的黄金储备。
    美帝国主义者正在制订进一步奴役其仆从国的计划。美国最大的各个垄断资本家的二千多名代表——即不久前在纽约举行的“全国对外贸易大会”的参加者们，曾制订了美国的新的扩张计划。美帝国主义的这个强盗计划规定了要剥夺依附于美帝国主义的各个国家的主权，保证美国垄断资本可以自由进入原料产地和各种投资的领域，消除一切阻碍美国夺取新市场的经济壁垒。
    十分明显，实行这个掠夺纲领，将遭到英国和大西洋侵略集团中其他美国伙友的激烈反抗，同时也会遭到殖民地和各附属国的激烈反抗。
    每天的事实都以铁面无情的逻辑证明，战后时期由于统一的世界市场的瓦解，资本主义经济所固有矛盾已经更加尖锐化了。帝国主义国家之间的斗争已经变本加厉了。生产关系与生产力性质的抵触已达到如此程度：作为一种经济体系的资本主义制度已经不能再有经济总高涨的远景。比起战前时期来，整个的资本主义经济的世界体系已是更加大大地狭窄、软弱和更加不牢固了。
