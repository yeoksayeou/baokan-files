Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: Moscow has begun the work of nominating candidates for the local Soviets. Now, tens of thousands of workers in Moscow's factories and institutions are holding meetings to nominate candidates for the Moscow Oblast Soviet.

    In the Stalin electoral district, a grand nomination meeting was held in the large conference hall of the Electrical Equipment Factory. Thousands of workers, engineers, technicians, and other staff members, amid warm cheers, passed the proposal of assembly worker V. Budarin, unanimously nominating the leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, as a candidate for the Moscow Oblast Soviet. In his speech, Budarin said: In the hearts of all Soviet people, in the hearts of millions of ordinary people around the world, is the name of the great Stalin. The most beautiful things in our lives are inseparable from the glorious name of our beloved father and teacher, Stalin.

    Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms and outstanding leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have also been nominated as candidates by the masses. The staff of the Moscow Spotlight Factory unanimously nominated Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Moscow Oblast Committee, as a candidate. V. Kirilov, an outstanding turner at the factory, said: Our local Soviet election is a major national event. In any capitalist country, there is not and cannot be such widespread popular participation in elections. This year, inspired by the historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin's speech at the closing meeting of the Congress, and his great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the Soviet working people will vote with unprecedented political and labor enthusiasm.

    Many Party and non-Party workers, scientists, and artists have also been nominated as candidates. For example, A. Smirnov, an advanced turner at the Ilyich Factory who was elected as a deputy to the Moscow Oblast Soviet last time, has been nominated again this time. At a meeting of the staff of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, attendees warmly nominated the outstanding biochemist, active peace fighter, and member of the World Peace Council, A. Oparin, as a candidate for the Moscow Oblast Soviet.

    莫斯科开始地方苏维埃候选人提名工作
    斯大林被提名为莫斯科州候选人
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：莫斯科已开始地方苏维埃候选人的提名工作。现在莫斯科各工厂、机关中成千成万的劳动者们纷纷举行集会，提出莫斯科州苏维埃候选人。
    在斯大林选区，盛大的提名集会在电工器材厂的大会议厅中举行。数以千计的工人、工程师、技师和其他职员在热烈的欢呼声中通过了装配工人维·布达林的建议，一致提名全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林为莫斯科州苏维埃的候选人。布达林发言时说：在所有苏联人民的心中，在全世界千百万普通人的心中，都想着伟大的斯大林的名字。我们生活中最美好的事物都是与我们敬爱的父亲和导师斯大林的光辉的名字分不开的。
    斯大林的最亲密的战友、苏联共产党的优秀的领袖们也被群众提名为候选人。莫斯科探照灯工厂的工作人员一致提名苏联共产党中央委员会和莫斯科州委员会的书记尼基塔·谢尔基耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫为候选人。该厂优秀旋工维·基里洛夫说：我国的地方苏维埃选举是一件全国范围的大事。在任何资本主义国家，没有也不可能有这样广泛的人民参加选举。今年，苏联劳动人民受到苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的历史性决议、斯大林同志在代表大会闭幕会议上的演说和他的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的鼓舞，将在空前的政治和劳动热情中投票。
    许多党和非党的工人、科学家、艺术家也被提名为候选人。例如，上次当选的莫斯科州苏维埃代表、伊里奇工厂先进旋工亚·斯米尔诺夫这次又被提名出来。在苏联科学院主席团工作人员的集会上，到会者热烈地提出杰出的生物化学家、积极的和平战士和世界和平理事会理事亚·奥巴林为莫斯科州苏维埃的候选人。
