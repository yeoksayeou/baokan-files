    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan -- In its basic construction work in 1952, the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company implemented prefabrication construction methods, which played a decisive role in ensuring project quality and accelerating progress.

    Prefabrication is an advanced and scientific construction method from the Soviet Union. Its main characteristic is establishing specialized processing plants in suitable locations to prefabricate movable work objects into finished or semi-finished products. These are then transported to the construction site for installation or use according to the overall construction sequence of the project, thereby shortening on-site construction time and ensuring project quality. Accepting this advanced experience, Anshan Iron and Steel implemented this advanced Soviet construction method in 1952 during the construction of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant, two major projects. They successively established five processing plants for concrete mixing, wood molds, rebar, riveting, and sanitary pipes. From August 1952 to the present, in just over five months, these processing plants have mixed over 70,000 cubic meters of concrete, processed and installed 130,000 square meters of formwork, over 5,000 tons of rebar, nearly 10,000 tons of steel structure frames, crane steel beams, and foundation bolt fixing frames, and laid over 30,000 meters of sanitary pipes. The project quality fully met specifications. The amount of work they completed in five months would have taken about two years to complete in the past.

    Implementing prefabrication in basic construction is one of the important conditions for moving from decentralized small-scale production to centralized large-scale production. It opens up broad avenues for implementing mechanized construction, winter construction, specialized division of labor, and promotion of advanced experiences. The five processing plants mentioned above have now mechanized most of their processes. Taking the concrete mixing plant as an example, due to the implementation of mechanization in the material batching, transportation, and mixing processes, it promptly supplied over 60,000 cubic meters of concrete from September to December 1952, according to the needs of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant projects. This equals 90 percent of their total task for 1952. Anshan's winter temperatures often fall below freezing. In such a climate, construction was impossible in the past due to the freezing of concrete mortar. Because civil engineering construction could not be carried out in winter, the construction of mechanical installation and other projects was also hindered. However, Anshan implemented prefabrication, and heating equipment was installed in the factory buildings. Although it was a severe winter, civil engineering construction could still proceed as usual, breaking the seasonal restrictions on basic construction in the Northeast region and greatly accelerating the speed of basic construction. All processing plants now implement detailed division of labor and assembly line operations. The rebar processing plant divided the rebar processing process into five steps: batching, straightening, cutting, marking, and forming, and implemented assembly line operations. As a result, despite a shortage of technicians and a material transportation distance exceeding the quota set by the Northeast Industrial Department by three times, production efficiency still increased by 40 percent compared to the Northeast Industrial Department's quota. Since their establishment, the processing plants have promoted many advanced experiences with significant impact. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the wood mold plant designed 11 types of "standard formwork" based on the commonalities of the foundation engineering of the two major projects and the dimensions of China's board materials, simplifying the complexity of formwork construction and increasing work efficiency by two times. In terms of metal joining, the second riveting branch plant increased labor efficiency by two and a half times by changing riveting to welding and promoting advanced working methods such as short-arc rapid welding.

    Prefabrication also provides a reliable guarantee for ensuring project quality. The more than one hundred foundations of the seamless steel tube plant and the large-scale rolling mill required rebar in as many as 1,000 specifications, and there were nearly 100 different mixing ratios of concrete. Some foundation engineering sections had as many as 39 sections, and the rebar construction drawings alone numbered more than 40. To ensure project quality, each processing plant established sound construction design and quality inspection organizations. The quality inspection and mix design laboratory established by the concrete mixing plant conducted chemical analyses of existing stored cement, sand, and stone before mixing each type of concrete, based on the scientific theory of Soviet concrete mixing. It then determined the concrete mixing ratio and began large-scale mixing only after trial block testing met the design requirements. Trial block testing was also carried out on time during on-site pouring. Therefore, the project quality of the concrete can fully meet the design standards. Rebar, wood mold, and other plants also learned from advanced Soviet experiences, creating an engineering model for each project to be constructed in advance, organizing workers and technicians to repeatedly observe and study it. This allowed them to familiarize themselves with the complex projects being carried out in advance to avoid errors during formal installation. It also allowed them to discover unreasonable areas in the drawings from the creation and study of the model, which were then corrected by the construction design personnel. In addition, the processing plants formulated technical operating procedures and established a technical responsibility system, which also played a significant role in ensuring quality. The establishment of these processing plants at Anshan went through a relatively long period of planned preparation. The rebar plant and others with simpler equipment began preparations in August 1951 and were completed in February and March 1952. The concrete mixing plant, with more complex equipment, began preparation work as early as 1950 and only began formal production in June 1952. This was the first time that Anshan had adopted large-scale factory forms for basic construction, so some leading cadres and workers doubted this advanced construction method. Individual leading cadres and technicians worried that the processing plants would not be able to complete their tasks in time during large-scale construction, leading to delays. Individual workers did not understand the role of prefabrication and once mistakenly believed that building processing plants was a waste.

    鞍钢基本建设采用先进的工厂化施工方法
    对保证工程质量和加快工程进度起了决定作用
    【新华社鞍山讯】国营鞍山钢铁公司在一九五二年基本建设中推行工厂化施工，对于保证工程质量和加快工程进度起了决定性的作用。
    工厂化施工，是苏联先进的科学的基本建设施工方法。它的主要特点是：在适当的位置设立专门加工厂，把可以搬动的工作对象，预先做成成品或半成品，按照整个工程的施工程序运到现场装置或使用，以缩短现场施工时间，并保证工程质量。接受这个先进经验，鞍钢在一九五二年建设大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的两大主要工程时，曾经推行了苏联这一先进的施工方法。他们先后建立了混凝土搅拌、木模、钢筋、铆造、卫生管道等五个加工厂。从一九五二年八月到现在，只五个多月，这些加工厂就搅拌混凝土七万多立方公尺，加工和安装模板十三万平方公尺、钢筋五千多吨、钢结构房架、吊车钢梁和地脚螺丝固定架等近万吨，铺设卫生管道三万多公尺。工程质量完全合乎规格。他们五个月所作的工程量，在过去需要两年左右才能完成。
    在基本建设中实行工厂化施工，是由分散的小量生产走向集中的大规模生产的重要条件之一。它可以给实行机械化施工、冬季施工、劳动专业化分工和推广先进经验开辟广阔的道路。上面说的这五个加工工厂，到现在大部分工序都已实行了机械化作业。以混凝土搅拌厂为例，由于在配料、运料、搅拌等生产过程中都实行了机械化作业，在一九五二年九月到十二月的四个月中，就根据大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂两大工程的需要，及时地供应了六万多立方公尺的混凝土，等于它们一九五二年总任务的百分之九十。鞍山冬季气温常在冰点以下，在这样的气候下，因混凝土灰浆冻结，过去是无法施工的；由于土木建筑工程在冬天不能施工，机械安装等工程的施工也要受到阻碍。但鞍钢实行了工厂化施工，在厂房内装置了采暖设备，虽然在凛冽的寒冬，土木建筑工程仍能照常施工，打破了东北地区基本建设施工的季节性限制，大大地加速了基本建设的速度。各加工厂现在都实行了细密的劳动分工和流水作业法。钢筋加工厂把钢筋加工过程划分为配料、矫正、剪断、划线和成型五个工序，并实行了流水作业法，结果在技工不足、材料运输距离超过东北工业部定额三倍的情况下，生产效率仍较东北工业部的定额提高了百分之四十。各加工厂成立以来推广了许多有重大作用的先进经验。木模厂接受苏联专家建议，根据两大工程设备基础工程共同点和我国板材的尺寸，设计出十一种“标准模板”，统一进行制作，大大简化了模板施工的复杂性，使工作效率提高了两倍。铆造第二分厂在金属结合方面，由于把铆接变成了焊接，并推广了短弧快速焊接法等先进工作方法，劳动效率提高了两倍半。
    工厂化施工也给保证工程质量提供了可靠的保证。无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂两项基本建设工程的一百多个基础，所需钢筋的规格多至一千种以上，各种不同配合比例的混凝土也近百种。其中有的基础工程断面多至三十九个，仅钢筋的施工图纸就有四十多张。为了保证工程质量，各加工厂都设立了健全的施工设计和检查质量的机构。混凝土搅拌厂所设立的检查质量和设计配合比例的试验所，每在搅拌一种混凝土之前，都根据苏联混凝土配合的科学理论，对现储水泥、砂、石进行化验，然后确定混凝土的配合比例，并在经过试块检验达到设计要求后，才开始大量搅拌。在现场浇灌时，也按时作出试块检验。因此使混凝土的工程质量能完全合乎设计标准。钢筋、木模等厂也学习了苏联先进经验，对所施工的每个工程都事先制出一个工程模型，组织工人和技术人员反复观摩研究，这样一方面使他们事先熟悉所进行的复杂工程，以免在正式安装时发生错误；另一方面也从制作和研究模型中，发现图纸上不合理的地方，由施工设计人员进行修正。此外，各加工厂还制订了技术操作规程，并建立了技术责任制，也对保证质量起了很大作用。鞍钢成立的这些加工厂，经过了较长时间的有计划的筹备过程。其中设备比较简单的钢筋厂等，在一九五一年八月间就开始进行筹备工作，一九五二年二、三月间才告完成。设备比较复杂的混凝土搅拌厂远在一九五○年就着手筹建工作，一九五二年六月才开始正式生产。这样采用大规模的工厂形式进行基本建设施工，在鞍山还是初次，因此曾引起部分领导干部和职工对这种先进施工方法发生怀疑。个别领导干部和技术人员耽心加工厂到工程大规模施工时不能完成任务而误事。个别工人不了解工厂化施工的作用，并曾经错误地认为建设加工厂是一种浪费。
