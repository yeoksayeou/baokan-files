　　Last year on December 28th, before breakfast, Du Bailing, a fifteen-year-old student at our school, suddenly fell ill. The school medical room was not fully equipped, and it was impossible to diagnose the illness for a while; the patient was already limp, pale, and constantly spitting up green saliva. The workers were busy preparing breakfast for the students, so I and a dozen students carried Du Bailing to the county People's Hospital.

　　After a doctor's diagnosis, it was determined that Du Bailing was suffering from acute collapse and encephalitis, which was very dangerous and required immediate rescue. But one kind of medicine needed to be injected mixed with blood. I asked the doctor to draw my blood, but the doctor solemnly said, "I know your heart is weak, and it is not suitable to be stimulated again." Time was pressing, and I could not argue any further. I hurried out of the clinic. The students anxiously asked about Du Bailing's condition in unison. I explained to them about the need for a blood transfusion. Before I could finish speaking, the students shouted together, "I'll do it! I'll do it!"

　　"Teacher Chen, you have to transfuse mine!" Sixteen-year-old Tian Yiling squeezed to the front and said, "They are not as healthy as I am!" Not allowing anyone else to argue, he nimbly ran into the treatment room.

　　I and a dozen students nervously waited outside the door. Patients waiting for consultations and convalescents who came out for a walk were also moved by this incident.

　　When Tian Yiling came out rubbing his arm, the students flocked to comfort him. He smiled innocently and said, "I thought it would be like Dr. Bethune, and a lot would be drawn! Who knew only a little bit was drawn!"

　　In an instant, I thought of how deeply moved the students were when I talked about "Dr. Bethune giving blood to save Chinese wounded soldiers" in class. That day, Tian Yiling also said, "I want to learn the spirit of Dr. Bethune!" And today, this lovely child has already put his determination into practice with practical actions.

    田宜玲的决心实现了
    去年十二月二十八日早饭前，我们学校一个十五岁的学生杜柏皊突然病倒了。学校医疗室设备不全，一时诊断不出来是什么病症；而病人已经身体瘫软，面色发白，不断吐绿色的口水。工友们都忙着给学生开早饭，我就和十几个同学一起把杜柏皊抬送县人民医院。
    经医师诊断，知道杜柏皊患的是急性虚脱与脑炎，很危险，要马上进行抢救。但有一种药剂需要和血液混合注射。我要求医生抽我的血，但医生郑重地说：“我知道你的心脏很弱，不便再受刺激。”时间急迫，不容我再争执。我急忙走出门诊室。同学们焦灼地异口同声地询问杜柏皊的病情。我向他们说明要抽血的情况。没等我说完，“我来！我来！”同学们一起嚷了起来。
    “陈老师，得输我的！”十六岁的田宜玲挤到前面说：“他们都不如我健康！”不让别人再争，他已矫捷地跑进了治疗室。
    我和十几位同学紧张地守在门外。在门外候诊的病人和出来散步的疗养员们也都被这件事情感动了。
    等到田宜玲揉着胳膊走出来的时候，同学们拥上去慰问他。他天真地笑着说：“我以为像白求恩医生似的，要抽得很多呢？谁知就抽了一点点！”
    刹那间，我想到过去讲课时讲到“白求恩医生输血救中国伤员”一文时，同学们都深深受到感动。那天，田宜玲还发言说：“我要学习白求恩医生的精神！”而今天，这个可爱的孩子已经用实际行动来实践自己的决心了。          江苏睢宁中学教员　陈宏举（附图片）
