Editor's Note: Currently, a large number of basic construction workers in various regions are undergoing political study. A practical difficulty is the lack of political instructors. The Changchun City Construction Workers' Winter Training Committee in Northeast China established a central classroom, which solved this difficult problem. At present, many units in various regions only complain about the difficulties without actively trying to solve them, or adopt an irresponsible attitude, casually finding some people to teach a few classes, resulting in poor results. Winter training is an important part of the preparatory work for basic construction, and conscientiously solving the various specific problems in winter training is a concrete way to strengthen the leadership of basic construction. Winter training committees in various regions should conscientiously find ways to solve the difficulty of insufficient instructors so that the short winter training can achieve the expected results.

Northeast China's Changchun City Construction Workers' Winter Training Committee
Establishes Central Classroom to Solve the Difficulty of Insufficient Winter Training Instructors

[This newspaper reported] The Changchun City Construction Workers' Winter Training Committee established a central classroom and adopted a teaching method of transmission, which solved the difficulty of lacking instructors in winter training. Before the start of winter training for construction workers in Changchun City, various units generally felt the difficulty of lacking instructors and teaching materials. Some units could only find one or two instructors, and some could not find any at all. The city's seventeen training classes lacked a total of twenty-five full-time instructors. At the same time, since the unified compiled teaching materials had not yet been distributed, teachers felt that they had nothing to base their lesson preparation on, which further deepened this difficulty. In order to solve this problem, the Changchun City Winter Training Committee established a central classroom, hired responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and other units to give lectures, and invited instructors and tutors from various units to attend the lectures. The content of each lesson taught by the central classroom instructors was used as an outline for the instructors to teach. The instructors from various units then supplemented some specific materials based on the specific conditions of their own units to make it compatible with the acceptance ability of the students, and then taught the workers separately. In this way, some comrades in each unit could take on the work of full-time instructors. As a result, the problems of instructors and teaching materials were solved. An instructor from Changchun Construction Company reflected: "At the beginning of the school year, I felt unsure and didn't know where to start. With this central classroom, I have something to rely on." Pan Fulun, an instructor from the Fourth Construction Team of the Construction Engineering Bureau, said: "I was always afraid of saying something wrong about some principles and policies. With the central classroom, I have a guarantee. Otherwise, there is a lot of material, and I don't know where to start." The workers also believe that in the past, when leaders gave reports directly, it was too deep and difficult to understand. The transmission method is easier to understand. For example, Yao Wancai, a carpenter from the Twelfth Group of the Third Construction Team of Changchun City, said: "I didn't like to study before because I didn't understand. After the tutor gave me a small class, I listened carefully, and I can also speak at the discussion meetings."

    编者按：各地现有大量基本建设职工正在进行政治学习。政治教员缺乏是个实际困难。东北长春市建筑工人冬训委员会成立中心课堂，解决了这个困难问题。目前各地有不少单位，光喊困难却不积极设法解决，或者采取不负责任的态度，随便找些人兼兼课就算了，以致效果很不好。冬训是基本建设准备工作的一项重要内容，认真地解决冬训中的各项具体问题，就是具体地加强对基本建设的领导。各地冬训委员会都应认真想法解决教员不足的困难，使为期很短的冬季训练达到预期的效果。

    建立中心课堂解决冬训教员不足的困难
    【本报讯】长春市建筑工人冬训委员会，创办中心课堂，采取传授方式教学，解决了冬训中缺乏教员的困难。长春市建筑工人冬训开始之前，各单位普遍感到缺乏教员和教材的困难。有的单位只能找出一两个教员，有的根本找不出来，全市十七个训练班共缺少二十五名专职教员；同时由于统一编印的教材尚未发下，教师备课感到无所依据，因而更加深了这一困难。为了解决这一问题，长春市冬训委员会成立了中心课堂，聘请市委、市府及其他单位负责同志讲授，请各单位教员和辅导员来听课，以中心课堂教员所讲每课内容作为教员讲课的提纲，各单位教员再结合本单位具体情况补充一些具体材料，使之与学员接受能力相适应，然后再分别向工人讲授。这样各单位就有一些同志可以担当专职教员的工作。因而教员、教材问题得到解决。长春建筑公司一个教员反映：“开学时我心里没底，不知道从哪里下手，有了这个中心课堂可就有了本钱。”建筑工程局第四施工队教员潘福伦说：“有些原则、政策问题总怕讲错了，有了中心课堂就有了保障，不然材料一大堆不知从哪里下手好。”工人也认为过去请首长直接作报告太深，听不明白，传授方式容易懂。如长春市建筑第三中队木工十二组姚万才说：“我以前因为听不懂就不爱学习，辅导员给上了小课，我就听入耳了，在讨论会上也能发言了。”
