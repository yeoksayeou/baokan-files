Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing. Deng Fangzhi, mother of Huang Jiguang, a second-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, recently wrote letters to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reporting on the warm care she has received from the people of the whole country and her living conditions.

    Deng Fangzhi's letter to Chairman Mao:

    Respected Chairman Mao:

    My name is Deng Fangzhi, I am sixty-one years old this year, and I live in the third village of Shimaxiang, Tongshan District, Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province. Huang Jiguang, the special-class hero and second-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, is my third son.

    After Guang'er's glorious sacrifice, the third sub-delegation of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, led by Deputy Head Yin Chaofan, as well as representatives from the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, the Sichuan Provincial Anti-US and Aid Korea Branch, the Sichuan Provincial People's Comfort Group, the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Southwest Regional Work Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, came from far away to Zhongjiang to attend Guang'er's memorial service. They also brought many慰问品 (consolation items) to comfort me. Everyone affectionately called me "Mother Huang." Everyone said they wanted to be my children and invited me to visit their factories, offices, schools, and villages. Yin Chaofan also told me that the volunteer soldiers at the front all wanted to recognize me as their mother. I really felt unspeakably honored. At this time, I thought of you, and I understood in my heart that today's glory was given to me by you.

    Respected Chairman Mao: Our ancestors were all farmers who suffered. Before liberation, landlords exploited us, and the township, bao, and jia leaders rode on our heads. The few acres of ancestral farmland were also forced into pawn, and the family had little to eat or wear. It was really hard! In the 1942 drought, my sons were so hungry and weak that they couldn't move in bed. In February 1949, when there was nothing to eat at home, Jiguang went to the ditch to catch shrimp and came across the dead dog of a puppet jia leader that had been beaten to death in the ditch. The puppet jia leader, without distinguishing right from wrong, insisted that Jiguang had killed it, ordered him to parade the dead dog through the streets, and even demanded that my family buy a coffin and hold a Taoist ceremony for the dog. At that time, there was simply no way for us poor people to live!

    Great Chairman Mao: Thank you for leading us to liberation. We turned ourselves over, distributed land, settled down, and started living a good life.

    Respected Chairman Mao: We know how to defend our good life. On the day Jiguang left home, he told me that he was going to Korea to fight the evil American devils and would not return home until the American devils were wiped out. He told me to do a good job in production in the rear and produce more grain to support the front. I was really happy to hear Guang'er speak with such ambition. But I understood even more that this was because you and the Communist Party had educated him well.

    Now, although Jiguang has gloriously sacrificed himself, thousands upon thousands of young people are willing to be my children. They have all expressed their willingness to learn from Jiguang's spirit, to do a good job in combat, work, and study to defend and build our great motherland, which is my greatest comfort. I must encourage them to continue to bravely kill the enemy and work hard in production to defend the motherland and world peace, defeat the American devils as soon as possible, and avenge Jiguang. At the same time, I will educate my youngest son, Jishu, well, teach him to learn from his brother, and strive to become a national hero and model.

    Respected Chairman Mao: My life is very good now. The leaders of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, the Suining Special District, and the Zhongjiang County People's Government have taken very good care of me. I must invest the慰问金 (consolation money) in production, do a better job in production, and produce more grain to support my relatives – the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Only in this way can I be worthy of my heroic son, worthy of the entire Chinese people, and worthy of you – the great Chairman Mao! I am now the women's representative in the village. I must respond to all your calls and take the lead among the masses, striving to be a model revolutionary martyr's family member and come to Beijing to see you.

    I wish you good health!

           Respectfully, Deng Fangzhi

    Deng Fangzhi's letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    Brave Volunteer Army Comrades – My dear children:

    I am Huang Jiguang's mother. Jiguang is my beloved third son. On December 26th last year, I went to the market and learned that Guang'er had sacrificed himself on the Korean front. At that time, it felt like a piece of flesh had been cut from my body. What mother in the world doesn't love her children!

    From that day on, people from the village and township kept coming to see me. District Chief Cha and Deputy County Chief Zhang, as well as Commissioner Lan of Suining Special District, all traveled over mountains and rivers from far away to comfort me. They all said: Jiguang blocked the enemy's machine-gun nest with his own body in the Battle of Shangganling, allowing his comrades to rush up and annihilate more than 1,200 American devils, making a great contribution to the motherland. Everyone said that it was a great honor for me to have raised such a hero, and told me not to be too sad.

    Everyone's concern educated me and reminded me of what Guang'er said when he left home: "Mom, this time I volunteer to go to the front line to defend the victorious fruits of our liberation and to defend the peace of the motherland and the world. I will always remember what Mom said and kill more American devils!" Now, Guang'er has done what he said he would do. He sacrificed himself for the happiness of the majority. He had ambition.

    Now, wherever I go, people call me "Hero's Mom," "Glorious Mom," "Dear Mom." Young students from Beijing, Harbin, and Haicheng in Liaodong... in many, many places, are writing letters of condolence to me, asking me to accept them as my children. Li Jingquan, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, also wrote a letter of condolence to me in his own handwriting and sent a comfort group. Also, Yin Chaofan, Deputy Head of the Third Sub-Delegation of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, personally came to comfort me. He brought your regards and said that you all wanted to recognize me as your mother and bravely advance in Guang'er's footsteps. I lost one son, but now I have thousands upon thousands of sons. Dear children, I love you as much as I love Guang'er. I hope that you, like Guang'er, under the guidance of Commander Peng, will fight bravely, annihilate more American devils, avenge Guang'er, and let people all over the world live peaceful and happy lives.

    Dear children, please don't worry about my life. The People's Government and the villagers are taking good care of me. The People's Government has issued me a pension. People from all walks of life in Sichuan Province have also sent me many慰问金 (consolation money) and 慰问品 (consolation items), from clothes to wear and fire tongs for burning firewood, to fertilizers for production.

    Although I am already sixty-one years old, I don't think I am too old. I still have a lot of strength to dedicate to the motherland. I am now the women's representative in the village. I will actively respond to the government's various calls and take the lead in work. I plan to use the慰问金 (consolation money) for production and produce more grain for the country to support you. I will also educate my youngest son, Jishu, well, teach him to learn from his brother, and strive to become a hero and a model.

    I hope you will write often so I don't worry!

    I am waiting for your victory!

    黄继光烈士的母亲写信给毛主席和志愿军
    【新华社重庆讯】中国人民志愿军二级战斗英雄黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝最近写信给毛主席和中国人民志愿军，报告她受到全国人民的热切关怀和她的生活情况。
    邓芳芝给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我叫邓芳芝，今年六十一岁，家住四川省中江县通山区石马乡第三村。中国人民志愿军特等功臣、二级战斗英雄黄继光就是我的三儿。
    光儿光荣牺牲以后，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第三分团尹超凡副团长和四川省人民政府、四川省抗美援朝分会、四川省各界人民慰问团、中国人民解放军西南军区和中国新民主主义青年团西南区工作委员会都派代表从很远的地方到中江来参加光儿的追悼大会。他们还带了许多慰问品来慰问我。大家亲切地喊我“黄妈妈”。大家都说愿作我的儿女，请我到他们工厂、机关、学校、乡村去耍。尹超凡也告诉我说，前方志愿军战士都愿认我做他们的妈妈。我真感到说不出的光荣。这时我就想起了您，我心里明白，今天的光荣，是您给我的。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们祖祖辈辈都是受苦受难的农民。解放前，地主剥削我们，乡、保、甲长骑在我们的头上，祖传的几亩田地也被迫典当了，一家人少吃无穿，实在苦啊！一九四二年旱灾，我的几个儿子，都饿困在床上动也动不得。一九四九年二月，家里没有吃的东西，继光到河沟里捞虾子，碰着伪甲长的一条毛狗被人打死在河沟里。伪甲长不分青红皂白就一口咬定是继光打死的，叫他背死狗游街，还要我家给狗买棺材、做道场。那时，简直是没有我们穷人的活路啊！
    伟大的毛主席：感谢您领导我们得到了解放、我们才翻了身，分了土地安了家，过起好日子来。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们懂得怎样来保卫我们的好日子。继光在离家那天，就曾经告诉我说，他要到朝鲜去打万恶的美国鬼子，不消灭美国鬼子决不回家。他叫我在后方把生产搞好，多打粮食支援前线。听光儿说话这样有志气，我心里真是高兴。但我更明白这是您和共产党把他教育好的。
    现在，继光虽然光荣牺牲了，但千千万万的青年都愿作我的儿女。他们都表示要学习继光的精神，为保卫和建设我们伟大的祖国，把战斗、工作和学习搞好，这就是我最大的安慰。我一定要鼓励他们为保卫祖国和世界和平，继续英勇杀敌和努力生产，早日打垮美国鬼子，为继光报仇。同时，我还要把我的小儿继恕教育好，教他学哥哥的样子，争取当国家的英雄和模范。
    敬爱的毛主席：现在我的生活很好。四川省人民政府、遂宁专署、中江县人民政府的首长对我的照顾很周到；我一定要把慰问金投入生产，把生产搞得更好，多打粮食，支援我的亲人——中国人民志愿军。这样才对得起我英雄的儿子，对得起全中国人民，对得起您——伟大的毛主席！我现在是村上的妇女代表，我要响应您的一切号召，在群众中起带头作用，争取当一个革命烈士家属模范，到北京来见您。
    祝您健康！
           邓芳芝敬上
               一月二十二日
    邓芳芝给中国人民志愿军的信英勇的志愿军同志们——我亲爱的儿女们：
    我是黄继光的妈妈。继光是我心爱的三儿。去年十二月二十六日，我去赶集，知道光儿在朝鲜前线牺牲了，当时我身上像割了一块肉，天下母亲谁不疼她的儿女！
    就在这天以后，村里、乡里的人不断来看我，查区长、张副县长、遂宁专区兰专员都从很远的地方翻山越岭来慰问我。他们都说：继光在上甘岭战斗中，用自己身体堵住敌人的机关枪眼，让战友们冲上去，消灭了一千二百多个美国鬼子，为祖国立了大功。大家都说我养育了这样一个英雄，是很光荣的，叫我不要过分伤心。
    大家对我的关心，教育了我，使我记起了光儿离家时说的话：“妈妈，这回我志愿到前线去，要保卫我们翻身的胜利果实，保卫祖国和世界的和平。我一定时时记着妈妈的话，多杀美国鬼子！”现在，光儿是做到了他自己说过的话了。他为了多数人过幸福日子，牺牲自己，他有志气。
    现在我走到那里，人们都称呼我“英雄的妈妈”、“光荣的妈妈”、“亲爱的妈妈”。北京、哈尔滨和辽东的海城……很多很多地方的青年学生们，都写慰问信给我，要我接受他们做我的儿女。四川省人民政府李井泉主席也亲笔写信慰问我，还派来了慰问团。还有中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第三分团副团长尹超凡，也亲自跑来慰问我，他带来了你们的心意，他说你们都要认我做妈妈，要踏着光儿的血迹勇敢前进。我失掉了一个儿子，现在却有了千千万万个儿子。亲爱的儿女们，我像爱光儿一样地爱着你们。我希望你们也像光儿一样，在彭司令员的教导下，英勇作战，更多地消灭美国鬼子，为光儿报仇，叫全世界的人都过和平、幸福的好日子。
    亲爱的儿女们，请不要记挂我的生活，人民政府和乡亲们对我照顾得很好。人民政府给我发了抚恤金。四川省各界人民还给我送来了许多慰问金和慰问品，从穿的衣服，烧火用的火钳，到生产上用的肥料，都给我送来了。
    我虽然已经六十一岁了，但我觉得我并不算老，还有很多力量要献给祖国。我现在是村上的妇女代表，我要积极响应政府的各种号召，在工作中起带头作用。我准备把慰问金用到生产上去，为国家多打些粮食来支援你们。我还要把我的小儿继恕教育好，教他学哥哥的样子，争取当英雄和模范。
    望你们常常来信，免得我挂念！
    我等着你们胜利的消息！
          邓芳芝
          一月十八日
