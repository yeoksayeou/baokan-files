(Editor's Note: The experiences gained by the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee in its Party rectification experiment are worth referencing for all regions. The most important experience is that it is necessary to conduct a thorough education for all Party members, so that Party rectification becomes a self-ideological transformation movement for all Party members. The Party rectification method of simple, impatient, and all-encompassing substitution by work teams is incorrect.)

CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee Summarizes Rural Party Rectification Experiment

The CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee convened a summary meeting on Party rectification experiments in early December last year after the conclusion of the Party rectification experiment in rural areas throughout the province. The meeting summarized experiences in order to better lead the province's rural Party rectification work.

A total of 341 Party branches in Heilongjiang Province conducted Party rectification experiments, with 4,852 Party members participating in Party rectification studies. Each experimental area was personally led by county Party committee members and heads of county committee departments. In this Party rectification experiment, the principle of "leadership, planning, and steady progress" was implemented, and Party rectification cadres deeply realized that sufficient ideological education work must be carried out in rural Party rectification; otherwise, it would be impossible for rural Party members to ideologically draw a clear line between the working class and the exploiting classes, and to clearly understand the direction of rural production development; nor would it be possible for the broad masses to understand the significance of Party rectification, voluntarily participate in Party rectification studies, and help the Party branch rectify itself. According to incomplete statistics: In this Party rectification experiment, a total of 1,550 Youth League members and 2,077 mass activists participated in Party rectification studies, and more than 10,000 people spontaneously came to listen to Party lectures, receiving education on communism and the direction of rural economic development.

Many Party members consciously introduced their gains in Party rectification at mass meetings after returning to the village, and reviewed their mistakes of not leading mutual aid teams well or using coercive methods to lead mutual aid teams. These reviews were very educational for the masses. Zhang Xiang, a Party member from the eighth village in the third district of Zhaodong, reviewed to the masses that he had not implemented the Party's policy well, which resulted in no great improvement in the lives of the masses in his group. The masses present were very moved and said: "This cannot be blamed solely on the Party members. Some of us are really difficult to lead. We all have to be conscious in the future."

Through Party rectification, the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation has been further implemented. According to statistics from five villages including Guoyu Village in Nehe County and the eighth village in the third district of Zhaodong, permanent mutual aid teams increased from nine to forty-two, and seasonal mutual aid teams increased from thirty-nine to fifty-eight.

In this Party rectification experiment, the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee realized that the following three issues must be grasped in Party rectification.

First, in the guiding ideology of Party rectification work cadres, it must be clearly recognized that Party rectification is a self-ideological transformation movement for all Party members. Only by fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all Party members, being good at cultivating activists among Party members, and organizing them to form the core of leading Party rectification work can Party rectification work be done well. Therefore, in Party rectification training, the original Party branch should be taken as the unit. Except for individual Party committee members with bad ideology and work style who must be replaced, generally the original Party committee should lead the Party rectification work. Before the start of the training, solicit the opinions of the Party branch to establish a general branch. Three-fifths of the members of the general branch should be composed of Party branch secretaries, outstanding Party members, model Party member cadres, Party member labor models, and Party member people's heroes from grassroots organizations. Through them, mobilize Party rectification, understand the situation, take the lead in making self-criticisms, help each other, organize discussions, give full play to the internal strength of the general branch and Party branch, and rely on all Party members to do a good job in Party rectification. At the same time, county and district Party rectification cadres can concentrate on ideological leadership work.

Party rectification experience in various places proves that whenever this is done, the rural Party rectification work truly becomes a conscious and voluntary ideological transformation movement of the broad masses of rural Party members, and the Party rectification work is smoothly carried out. Conversely, if the Party rectification work team does everything for them, it will lead to formalism and even create a bad influence among the masses, causing losses to the work.

Second, the central issue of rural Party rectification is to conduct class education for rural Party members, that is, to conduct communist education, and to positively establish the thinking of the new road of cooperation and mutual assistance. Party rectification education can be roughly divided into the following steps: (1) Conduct communist education to enable Party members to recognize the beautiful prospects of communism from the positive aspect, firmly establish a communist outlook on life from their personal experience, and encourage Party members to strive for the realization of cooperation and collectivization. (2) On the basis of establishing new understanding, enlighten Party members to gradually expose and criticize the exploitation thinking and exploitation behavior of rich peasants, and recognize the harmfulness and root causes of this thinking, and further improve the Party members' level of awareness. (3) According to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau and the actual situation of Party members, draw a clear line between exploitation and non-exploitation and non-exploitation theory, prevent the expansion of the scope of exploitation; and specifically help Party members solve practical problems, such as establishing credit cooperatives, actively brewing among Party members how to implement the Party's rural production policies and tasks, and organizing and consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations. (4) To further consolidate and improve the results of Party rectification, it is necessary to combine educating Party members with educating the broad masses, and combine Party rectification education with improving branch leadership and improving rural leadership. For this reason, democratic remedial lessons must be conducted after returning to the village after training, which is an important step to further consolidate ideological work from actual work.

Some areas, when examining their thinking, used methods such as leadership demonstrations to enlighten the vast number of rural Party members to consciously examine their own erroneous thinking. For example, when the Keshan County Party Committee announced the Five-Year Construction Plan to Party members, it took the lead in examining its leadership attitude towards mutual aid groups. In the Party rectification, they also organized Party members to visit the Heping Collective Farm and listen to the reports of the visiting Soviet farmers' delegation, so that the Party members felt that "this time we have a goal to strive for," and "the county Party committee has made self-criticisms, so we have to work hard to correct our shortcomings." Kedong County also invited Fang Zhaozhong to report on the situation of their agricultural cooperative and answer the questions raised by everyone. Some Party members said: "Brother Lao Fang, he is also a Party member, and we are also Party members. He leads everyone to take the new road of agricultural cooperatives, and everyone lives a prosperous life. But what about us? We have not yet joined the mutual aid group."

In the Longjiang Party rectification experiment, due to the adoption of positive education methods, after the Party rectification, Party members consciously and actively reorganized mutual aid organizations, made plans, and prepared for the large-scale production in 1953. In other places, due to the initial criticism or just finding some trivial matters to criticize, the Party members were burdened with heavy ideological burdens, their morale was low, and even individual places had the phenomenon of avoiding Party rectification.

Third, in Party rectification, it is necessary to do a good job in preparing for the large-scale production in 1953 and lay the foundation for further developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The entire Party rectification process is also an ideological education process for further realizing and improving agricultural cooperation, and it is also a process of improving and improving mutual aid and cooperation organizationally. How should Party rectification be combined with production? It can be roughly divided into the following steps: (1) When widely mobilizing Party rectification and publicizing the significance of Party rectification, we should start to understand the leadership of Party branch members over mutual aid groups. (2) During the training, we should combine ideological criticism to expose the actual problems existing in mutual aid and cooperation work, and further brew the consolidation and improvement of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After ideological self-criticism, many Party members treated the masses' production problems with a positive attitude. Some wrote letters to let their family members join the group, some discussed with the masses in the village how to improve the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the village, and some wrote letters to encourage the cadres of the village temporary work committee to seize the leadership of winter production. In this way, it directly promoted rural production. (3) When returning to the village to conduct democratic remedial lessons, we should also summarize the experience of high-yield and mutual aid cooperation. Calling people's representatives' meetings and re-electing village committees must also be carried out around production.

Experience proves that whenever the above steps are followed, not only the mutual aid and cooperation movement is deeply examined, but also the rich peasant ideology is specifically and thoroughly criticized, thereby improving and improving the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Conversely, if the examination of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is abandoned and the rich peasant ideology is criticized in isolation, the main energy of Party members will be entangled in other trivial matters, and they will not be able to grasp the edge.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee believes that the main shortcomings in this stage of the Party rectification pilot are: in some places, the criticism of rich peasant ideology is not deep and thorough enough, and the problem has not been completely solved, or it is not combined with production enough, and there is a phenomenon of all-encompassing substitution in the leadership style. The reasons for these shortcomings are: some leading cadres do not have a comprehensive understanding of the rich peasant ideology; some also regard the criticism of the rich peasant ideology as easy, so the education is not practical and the effect is not great.

Now, the first phase of Party rectification work in rural areas of Heilongjiang Province is being carried out on the basis of the above experience. A total of 26 counties, 1,148 Party branches, and 15,700 Party members are participating in this Party rectification. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee believes that after the full launch of the Party rectification work in the province, it must seize the leadership and strictly control it. To this end, Zhao Dezun, Chen Lei, Zhang Shiying, Li Jianbai and other ten members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee went to various counties to conduct inspections.

### 中共黑龙江省委总结农村整党试验工作

    编者按：中共黑龙江省委整党试验工作所取得的经验是值得各地参考的。最主要的经验就是一定要向全体党员进行一次深入的教育，使整党成为全体党员自我思想改造运动。那种由工作组简单急躁进行包办代替的整党办法，是不对的。
    中共黑龙江省委总结农村整党试验工作
    中共黑龙江省委在全省农村整党试验工作结束后，于去年十二月上旬召开了整党试验总结会议，总结经验，以便更好地领导全省农村整党工作。
    黑龙江全省进行整党试验的支部共有三百四十一个，参加整党学习的党员共有四千八百五十二名。各试验地区均由县委委员和县委会部长一级干部亲自领导。在这次整党试验中，贯彻了有领导、有计划、稳步前进的方针，并使整党干部深刻地体会到在农村整党中必须进行充分的思想教育工作；否则就不可能使农村党员从思想上划清工人阶级和剥削阶级的界限，明确认识农村生产发展方向；也不可能使广大群众认识整党的意义，自动参加整党学习，帮助支部整党。据不完全的统计：此次整党试验中，共有一千五百五十名团员和二千零七十七名群众积极分子参加整党学习，并有一万多群众自动来听党课，受到了共产主义和农村经济发展方向的教育。
    许多党员回村后自觉地在群众大会上介绍自己在整党中的收获，检讨了自己没有很好地来领导互助组或用强迫命令的方法来领导互助组的错误。这些检讨，对群众教育很大。肇东三区八村党员张祥向群众检讨自己没有很好执行党的政策，致使本组的群众生活没有很大改善。到会的群众很受感动，并说：这不能光怨党员，咱们里边有的人实在不好领导，今后咱们都得自觉才好。
    经过整党，党的互助合作政策得到了进一步的贯彻。据讷河县国裕村、肇东三区八村等五个村统计，常年互助组由九个发展到四十二个，季节性互助组由三十九个发展到五十八个。
    在这次整党试验中，中共黑龙江省委体会到整党必须掌握以下三个问题。
    第一，在整党工作干部的领导思想上，必须明确认识整党是全体党员自我思想改造运动，只有充分发挥全体党员的积极性，善于培养党员中的积极分子，把他们组织起来，形成领导整党工作的核心，才能把整党工作做好。因此，整党集训中应以原支部为单位，除了个别思想作风恶劣的支委，必须更换外，一般的由原来的支委会领导整党工作。在集训开始前，征求支部意见建立总支。总支委员应有五分之三是基层组织中的支部书记、优秀党员、模范党员干部、党员劳动模范和党员人民功臣担任。通过他们进行整党动员，了解情况，在集训中由他们带头检讨，进行互助，组织讨论，充分发挥总支和支部的内在力量，依靠全体党员做好整党工作。同时县区整党干部可以集中注意于思想领导工作。
    各地整党经验证明，凡是这样做的，使农村整党工作真正成为广大农村党员的自觉自愿的思想改造运动，整党工作就顺利地展开。反之，由整党工作组包办代替，就产生形式主义，甚至在群众中造成不好影响，使工作受到损失。
    第二，农村整党的中心问题，就是对农村党员进行阶级教育，就是进行共产主义教育，从正面积极地树立合作互助新道路的思想。整党教育大致可分以下几个步骤进行：（一）进行共产主义教育，使党员从积极方面认清共产主义美好的远景，从切身体验中坚定共产主义的人生观，鼓舞党员为实现合作化、集体化而奋斗的热情。（二）在树立新的认识的基础上，启发党员逐步暴露和批判富农剥削思想和剥削行为，并认识这种思想的危害性和产生根源，进一步提高党员的觉悟程度。（三）根据东北局的指示和党员的实际情况，划清剥削与非剥削和不以剥削论的界限，防止扩大剥削范围；并具体帮助党员解决实际问题，如成立信贷部，积极地在党员中酝酿如何执行党的农村生产政策和任务，组织和整顿互助合作组织。（四）要进一步巩固和提高整党成果，必须将教育党员和教育广大群众结合起来，把整党教育与提高支部领导、改进农村领导结合起来。为此必须在集训后回村进行民主补课工作，它是进一步从实际工作中巩固思想工作的重要步骤。
    有些地区在检查思想时，又以领导示范等方法启发广大农村党员自觉地检查自己的错误思想。例如克山县委在向党员宣布五年建设计划时，就带头检查了自己对互助组的领导态度。在整党中又组织了党员参观了和平集体农庄，听访苏农民代表团的报告，使党员感到“这回可有了奔头”，“县委都检讨了，咱们得好好整缺点”。克东县还请房照忠报告了他们的农业合作社的情况，解答了大家提出的问题。有的党员说：“老房大哥，人家也是党员，咱也是党员，人家领导大家走农业合作社的新道路，都过着富裕的日子，可是咱呢？还没有参加互助组。”
    龙江整党试验中，由于采取了正面教育的方法，整党后，党员自觉地、积极地整理了互助组织，订计划，准备一九五三年的大生产。另有些地方由于一开始就批评一顿，或者只找一些生活琐事来批评。结果使党员思想负担很重，情绪低落，甚至个别地方发生了躲避整党现象。
    第三，在整党中必须做好一九五三年大生产的准备工作，打下进一步开展互助合作运动的基础。整个整党过程也即是进一步实现和提高农业合作化的思想教育过程，也是从组织上提高和改进互助合作的过程。整党如何结合生产呢？大致分以下几个步骤：（一）在广泛地进行整党动员，宣传整党意义时，就应着手了解支部党员对互助组领导的情况。（二）在集训时，应结合思想批判，揭发互助合作工作中存在的实际问题，并进一步酝酿巩固和改进互助合作运动。许多党员在思想检讨后，以积极的态度对待群众生产问题。有的写信让家里人插组，也有的和本村群众研究如何提高本村的互助合作组织，也有的写信鼓励村临时工作委员会的干部，抓紧领导冬季生产。这样，直接对农村生产起了推动作用。（三）回村进行民主补课时，还应总结丰产和互助合作经验。召开人民代表会，改选村委员等工作，也都必须围绕生产进行。
    经验证明：凡是按上述步骤做的，不仅深刻地检查了互助合作运动，而且也具体深入地批判了富农思想，从而提高和改进了互助合作运动。反之，离开了互助合作运动的检查，孤立地去批判富农思想，结果使党员的主要精力纠缠到其他琐碎的事件里，摸不着边际。
    黑龙江省委认为这一段整党试点中的主要缺点是：某些地方对富农思想还批判的不深不透，没有彻底解决问题，或与生产结合不够，在领导作风上则有包办代替现象。产生这些缺点的原因是：有些领导干部对富农思想的认识不全面；也有的把批判富农思想看得轻而易举，因而在教育中不切合实际，收效不大。
    现在，黑龙江省农村第一期整党工作，正在上述经验的基础上进行，参加这次整党的共有二十六个县，一千一百四十八个支部，一万五千七百名党员。黑龙江省委认为全省整党工作全面展开以后，必须抓紧领导，严格控制，为此，黑龙江省委赵德尊、陈雷、张士英、李剑白等十人分赴各县进行检查。
