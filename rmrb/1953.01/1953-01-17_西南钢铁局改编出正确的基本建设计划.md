Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th. The Southwest Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry conscientiously implemented the Central Committee's policy of "Concentrating Efforts on Building Key Factories," criticized the idea of rash advance, and reorganized and produced a correct basic construction plan for 1953.

    In compiling the basic construction plan for 1953, the Southwest Steel Industry Administration Bureau resolutely overcame the idea of not fully considering subjective strength and being greedy for quick results. When the bureau began discussing national investment targets and compiling the basic construction plan last fall, it did not consider whether the work in resource exploration, design, materials, and personnel was done well. It did not fully realize that rashly carrying out engineering construction without prior preparation would have very bad results for the country's construction cause. Therefore, the initial plan was relatively large. For example, the plan proposed to build a large blast furnace and coking oven at a certain factory, but the source and reserves of iron ore had not been clearly explored. Later, when the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry saw this plan, it immediately pointed out that the plan was inappropriate and too risky. Investment should be reduced, and preparatory work such as geological exploration and personnel training should be done first. The funds should be freed up and used in a concentrated manner for important projects that the country needs most and for which preparatory work has been done. After receiving the instructions from the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Southwest Steel Industry Administration Bureau conscientiously understood the spirit of the Central Committee's "Concentrating Efforts on Building Key Factories" and criticized the idea of rashly compiling construction plans without doing a good job of surveying and designing. It immediately began the re-compilation of the 1953 basic construction plan. Therefore, after the bureau recompiled the plan four times and reduced investment projects, it finally correctly compiled the basic construction plan for 1953. The basic construction plan that has now been compiled has been reduced by 68% compared to the original investment amount, and the number of investment projects has also been reduced considerably. All unrealistic and risky projects in the original plan have been removed from the 1953 plan, which ensures that the country can use funds in a more concentrated manner for the most important projects.

    In the newly compiled 1953 basic construction plan, the bureau reduced many engineering projects and concentrated its efforts to clearly grasp the two tasks of first doing a good job in the exploration of underground resources and the growth of personnel. In the plan now compiled by the bureau, 50% of the investment is used for geological exploration, and 28% is used for running technical schools and personnel training. For example, the original plan to build a large blast furnace and coking oven at a certain factory has been reduced. The new plan decides to first do a good job in the geological resource exploration of large blast furnaces and coking ovens in 1953. At the same time, preliminary designs for blast furnaces and coking ovens will be made, and drilling work for the foundation engineering of blast furnaces and coking ovens and preparation of transportation equipment will be done. This ensures that the construction plan is prudent, reasonable, and meets the needs. The bureau also paid attention to summarizing past basic construction experience; adjusted its organization, established a design office to concentrate designers; established an engineering company to train fixed workers; established a geological office and drilling team, and sent a large number of exploration personnel to work in various parts of the southwest; organized transportation teams to transport wood in the mountains; and also ran a large number of training courses and schools, and organized technicians and workers to study in advanced areas, actively preparing for work.

    In the process of re-compiling the plan, the leading cadres of the bureau conscientiously established a global perspective and a long-term perspective. After the new plan was determined, they temporarily transferred many excellent technicians, skilled workers, and administrative personnel to the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, where they were centrally used in the most important construction positions at present. They will be transferred back to the southwest when the bureau begins large-scale construction. The leading cadres of the bureau convened meetings of responsible cadres of various factories several times, explaining in detail the general spirit of national construction, and requiring the factory directors to have a global perspective and a long-term perspective. Therefore, when compiling the plan, leaders at all levels were able to implement the Central Committee's policy and concentrate their efforts to do a good job in preparation.

    西南钢铁局改编出正确的基本建设计划
    【新华社重庆十六日电】中央重工业部西南钢铁工业管理局认真贯彻执行中央“集中力量建设重点厂”的方针，批判了冒进思想，改编出正确的一九五三年基本建设计划。
    西南钢铁工业管理局在编制一九五三年基本建设计划中，曾坚决克服了不充分考虑主观力量、贪多冒进的思想。去年秋季该局开始讨论国家投资指标编制基本建设计划时，没有考虑到资源勘察、设计、材料、人材等各方面的工作做好没有，没有充分认识到事先不做好准备工作就贸然进行工程建设将对国家建设事业造成很坏的结果，所以最初的计划订得比较大。比如，计划拟建设某厂的大型炼铁高炉和炼焦炉，但是铁矿的矿源和蕴藏量都没有勘探清楚。后来，中央重工业部看到这个计划后，立即指出计划订得不恰当、太冒险，应该削减投资，先做好地质勘探工作和人材培养等准备工作，把资金腾出来集中使用到国家最需要而准备工作又已做好的重要工程上去。西南钢铁工业管理局接到中央重工业部指示后，认真领会了中央“集中力量建设重点厂”的精神，批判了不做好勘察、设计工作就编制施工计划的冒进思想；并立刻开始一九五三年基本建设计划的重编工作。因此，该局在四次重编计划、削减投资工程项目后，终于正确地编出了一九五三年的基本建设计划。现在编出的基本建设计划比原来投资额削减了百分之六十八，投资项目也削减了不少。凡是原计划中不切合实际、带有冒险性的项目都在一九五三年计划中除去，这样就保证了国家可以把资金更集中使用到最重要的工程上去。
    该局在新编的一九五三年基本建设计划中把许多工程项目削减了，集中力量明确抓住了先做好地下资源的勘探和人材的生长两项。该局现在编出计划中的投资有百分之五十是用在地质勘探，百分之二十八是用在办技术学校及人材培养方面。比如原计划中的建设某厂的大型高炉和炼焦炉这两项都削减了，在新计划中决定首先在一九五三年做好大型高炉和炼焦炉的地质资源的勘察工作，同时，把高炉和炼焦炉的初步设计作出来，把高炉和炼焦炉的地基工程钻眼工作和运输设备准备好，这样就保证了建设计划的慎重、合理、合乎需要。该局还注意了总结过去基本建设经验；调整了机构，成立设计处集中设计人员；成立工程公司训练固定的工人；成立地质处和钻探队，派大批勘探人员深入西南各地去工作；组织运输队到山上去运木材；并又大量办训练班、办学校，组织技术人员和工人到先进地区去学习，积极作好准备工作。
    在重编计划中，该局领导干部认真确立了全局观点和长远观点。在新计划确定后，他们把许多优秀的技术人员、技术工人、行政人员都暂时输送给中央重工业部，由中央重工业部集中使用到目前最重要的建设岗位上去，待该局开始大规模施工时，再调回西南来。该局领导干部曾数次召集各厂负责干部会议，详细说明国家建设的总的精神，要求各厂长要有全局观点和长远观点，因此，在编制计划时，各级领导干部都能贯彻中央的方针，集中力量把准备工作做好。
