Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 17th: The US liaison officer, Calk, in a notice delivered on the 15th, attempted to unilaterally tear up the agreement on not attacking the supply convoys of the delegation traveling daily between Kaesong and Pyongyang. As everyone knows, since the beginning of the negotiations, both sides had long reached an agreement stipulating that supply convoys serving the delegation in Kaesong would be exempt from attacks. However, the notice from the US liaison officer stated that from January 25th, these convoys would only be immune from attacks one day a week, on Sundays. This action by the US side, which effectively tears up the agreement, marks a perfidious move from deliberately undermining existing agreements towards completely abolishing them.
    Prior to this, the US side had been continuously violating this agreement. Since the beginning of the negotiations, American aircraft have perfidiously strafed or bombed our delegation's convoys no less than nine times, and these vehicles were clearly marked with the agreed-upon symbols. In the past year alone, sixteen people in the delegation convoys were injured, and one died. And the US side has still not responded to the recent incident in which American aircraft strafed our delegation convoy, injuring five people.
    Observers point out that this latest attempt by the US side to unilaterally tear up the agreement on not attacking the delegation's supply convoys is a further development of Washington's plan to gradually abolish all existing agreements maintaining the Panmunjom meeting area and neutral zone, and to completely sabotage the armistice negotiations. The US side's series of actions illustrate their purpose. Before the US side interrupted the Panmunjom negotiations last October, they first used a similar tactic, unilaterally adjourning for three days, a week, and ten days, and then indefinitely interrupting the negotiations. Clark refused to resume negotiations, and the United Nations' American voting machine rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for an immediate ceasefire and peaceful settlement of the Korean question, passing an illegal proposal that facilitated the American aggressors to continue a long-term and larger-scale war in Korea. After this whole set of procedures was completed, the American aggressors proceeded to unscrupulously destroy the agreements on the meeting area and neutral zone, and the agreement on delegation supply vehicles, in order to implement their plan to prolong and expand the war. Although the US side's notice still pays lip service to deceiving the world with false promises of being "ready to reconvene at any time," their open tearing up of existing agreements and threatening the existence of the meeting area and neutral zone have once again shown the world that in order to implement Eisenhower's military adventures in Asia, they will spare no effort to tear up solemn agreements and completely obliterate the armistice negotiations.

### 美方企图完全撕毁不袭击代表团车队协议

    美方企图完全撕毁不袭击代表团车队协议
    【新华社开城十七日电】　美方联络官卡洛克在十五日交来的一个通知中，企图片面撕毁关于不袭击每天来往于开城与平壤之间的代表团供应车队的协议。大家知道，自从谈判开始以后，双方早就获致协议，规定对每天为开城的代表团服务的供应车队免予袭击。可是，美方联络官的通知上说，从一月二十五日起，这种车队每星期只有星期日一天不受袭击。美方这一实际上是撕毁协议的行动，标志着美方正在背信弃义地从故意破坏现有的协议，走向完全取消这些协议。
    在此以前，美方就曾不断地破坏这项协议。自从谈判开始以来，美国飞机曾背信弃义地扫射或轰炸我方代表团的车队达九次之多，这些车辆都明显地设有双方协议了的标志。单在去年，代表团车队中就有十六人受伤，一人死亡。而对于最近美机扫射我方代表团车队打伤五人的事件，美方一直到现在都还没有答复。
    观察家指出，美国最近这一次企图片面撕毁关于代表团供应车队不受攻击的协议的行为，是华盛顿的逐步取消维持板门店会场区和中立区的现有一切协议并完全破坏停战谈判的计划的进一步发展。美方的一系列行动说明了他们的这个目的。美方在去年十月中断板门店谈判以前，先就要了一套类似的手法，他们片面休会三天、一星期、十天，然后就是无限期中断谈判，克拉克拒绝恢复谈判，联合国的美国表决机器拒绝了苏联的立即停战并和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，通过了便于美国侵略者继续在朝鲜进行长期的、更大规模的战争的非法提案。在这一整套手续办完之后，美国侵略者就来放手破坏关于会场区和中立区的协议和关于代表团供应车辆的协议，以利于他们实行延长并扩大战争。虽然美方的通知书中还口口声声地想用“随时准备复会”的虚伪诺言来欺骗全世界，但是他们的公开撕毁现有协议，威胁会场区和中立区的存在的行为，却已再一次向世界表明：他们为了实行艾森豪威尔在亚洲的军事冒险，将不遗余力地去撕毁庄严的协议，把停战谈判完全勾消。
