    Make Good Design Plans to Ensure On-Time Delivery of Quality Drawings to Construction Sites
    To do a good job in design work, just like doing other work, a plan must be made in advance. This involves, based on a comprehensive study of the design object, a thorough consideration of the conditions and necessary data for the design, and a detailed calculation of one's own design capabilities, correctly arranging the progress and steps of the work. Only in this way can the leadership have a clear understanding, proactively and predictably overcome difficulties in the work; can rationally organize design forces, and lead design work in a planned and step-by-step manner. Only then can the designers have clear goals to strive for, in order to proactively consider problems and arrange work, and also strengthen their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, improve design efficiency, and reduce rework and waste of manpower in the design process. When designing the No. 8 blast furnace, Anshan Iron and Steel Company did not make a design plan and used 8,000 workdays; when designing the No. 7 blast furnace, they made a design plan and launched a competition, using only 3,000 workdays. This example powerfully illustrates the importance of making a design plan.
    However, except for individual units, many design departments have not yet paid attention to this work, and design work is still blindly and passively "pushed forward." There is no certainty as to when the design task can be completed; the priority of design objects is not pre-arranged, and often secondary, easy-to-do designs are completed, while important engineering designs cannot be delivered on time. Design personnel lack clear responsibilities, the work is chaotic, efficiency is low, and quality cannot be guaranteed. Sometimes, halfway through the design, it is discovered that data is missing or other parts have not been coordinated well, and work has to be stopped midway, or even completely redone. In short, due to the lack of careful planning, the phenomenon of wasting design resources, delaying or disrupting construction is very common and serious. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leading comrades in many design departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of design progress plans. Therefore, they believe that the current design force is weak, and design data and design experience are very lacking. Under such conditions, it is impossible to formulate accurate design plans. In fact, this only sees the difficult side of this work, but fails to understand that it is precisely because our design force is small, data is scarce, and experience is insufficient that we need to formulate design plans to guide our work and overcome these objective difficulties. The experience of the Design Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has proved that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, mobilizes all personnel to participate in discussions, pays attention to collecting and sorting out design norms, and gradually establishes a responsibility system for design work, a relatively accurate design plan can be formulated. Design departments in various places should learn from the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, improve their work, and formulate advanced and practical design progress plans in order to ensure that quality drawings are delivered to the construction site on time!

### 做好设计计划，保证按时把质量良好的图纸送到工地

    做好设计计划，保证按时把质量良好的图纸送到工地
    要做好设计工作，应该和做其它工作一样，事先必须有一个计划。这就是根据对设计对象的全盘研究，对设计所具备的条件和必需资料的周密考虑，对自己设计能力的详细计算，正确地安排出工作的进度和步骤。只有这样，领导上才能心中有数，主动地、有预见地克服工作中的困难；才能合理地组织设计力量，有计划、有步骤地领导设计工作。设计人员才能有明确的奋斗目标，以便主动地考虑问题、安排工作，也才能加强责任心和发挥积极性，提高设计效率，减少设计中的返工现象和人力浪费。鞍山钢铁公司在设计八号高炉时，没有做设计计划，用了八千个工日；设计七号高炉时，订了设计计划，发动了竞赛，只用了三千个工日。这个例子充分有力地说明了制订设计计划的重要。
    但是，除了个别单位以外，很多设计部门都还没有重视这一工作，设计工作还是盲目自流地“推着干”。设计任务究竟何时能够完成，心里没有底；设计对象的轻重缓急也没有预先安排，往往是次要的、容易做的设计完成了，重要的工程设计反而不能按时交出。设计人员责任不明，工作忙乱，效率低，质量不能保证。有时设计到中途才发现缺少资料或其他部分没有配合好，不得不中途停止，甚至全部返工。总之，由于没有周密的计划，因而浪费设计力量，延误或打乱施工的现象是非常普遍而严重的。产生这种现象的原因，主要是因为很多设计部门的领导同志对设计进度计划的作用认识不足。因而认为目前设计力量薄弱，设计资料和设计经验都十分缺乏，在这样的条件下，制订确切的设计计划是不可能的。其实，这是只看到了这一工作困难的一面，却没有了解正是因为我们的设计力量小，资料少，经验不够，才更需要制订设计计划来指导工作，来克服这些客观困难。鞍山钢铁公司设计处的经验就证明了，只要领导上重视，发动全体人员参加讨论，注意搜集、整理与制订设计定额，逐步建立设计工作的责任制，比较准确的设计计划是完全可以制订出来的。各地设计部门应该学习鞍山钢铁公司的经验，改进工作，制订出先进的、切实可行的设计进度计划，以便保证按时把质量良好的图纸送到工程现场去！
