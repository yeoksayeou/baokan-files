The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Convenes a Meeting on State-Owned Farms
Determines This Year's Production Tasks and Steps to Improve Management and Operation

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting on state-owned farms on December 16th of last year (a special meeting was held separately for mechanized farms) to implement the decision of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on state-owned farms. The meeting reviewed the work of the farms and determined this year's production tasks for the province's state-owned farms and the steps to improve their management and operation.
    Over the past few years, the province's state-owned farms have grown from scratch to 141; in the process of building these farms, cadres have been trained, some production technologies and management experience have been accumulated, laying a favorable foundation for further development in the future. Some farms have gradually improved their farming techniques and produced more grain, playing a certain demonstration role among the masses. Currently, 32 farms have achieved "profitable production," and 21 farms have achieved a balance between income and expenditure. However, most farms are not well managed, and there are still capitalist management ideas and supply system ideas. Therefore, the farms have low yields, high costs, and significant waste. Some farms are losing money, and political work on the farms is weak. Some farms do not have basic Party or Communist Youth League organizations or Party members or Communist Youth League members. Union members account for only one-third of the farm's employees.
    The meeting discussed the above situation and, based on the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's meeting on state-owned farms, determined that the main tasks of the province's state-owned farms this year are to consolidate and improve, further play a demonstration role, and achieve the principle of profitable production, generally no longer expanding. The main criteria for judging whether a state-owned farm is well-run are whether it produces more grain and whether it plays a demonstration role in agricultural production. Therefore, all farms must actively improve agricultural techniques, use new agricultural implements, set up examples, and educate farmers. It is necessary to overcome the tendency to neglect improving agricultural technology, blindly expand cultivated land area, and not attach importance to increasing yield per unit area. At the same time, state-owned farms should, as far as possible, assist and guide mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives in technical aspects, summarize the masses' experience in high-yield technology, and guide the technical extension work of the entire county where they are located. State-owned farms should also establish close contact with agricultural technology extension stations, regularly organize the masses to visit demonstration farms, organize material exhibitions, hold forums and technical research meetings, and sign technical guidance contracts with surrounding mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives to spread technical experience.
    Secondly, it is necessary to improve management and operation, improve production efficiency, reduce costs, and overcome waste. 1. This winter, each farm, in conjunction with Party rectification and training, will conduct a thorough inventory of assets to determine the scope of operation, determine fixed assets and working capital, reduce unnecessary operating parts and dispose of inventory goods, supplement the shortage of working capital, and the scope of land management should also be initially determined. Establish a cost management system based on the inventory of assets. The cost per hectare must not exceed 60% of the harvest. To ensure cost reduction, it is necessary to implement quota management and increase the utilization rate of machinery and equipment. 2. Improve labor organization, implement a permanent fixed contracting system, and determine output targets based on fixed farming areas and fixed production teams. If there is a surplus at the end of the year, bonuses will be given. After fixing the sub-teams, it is necessary to carry out necessary exchange of labor and mutual assistance, and carry out production competitions. 3. Establish a responsibility system. First, establish a responsibility system for the breeding, management, and use of draft animals, and establish books for grain, farm implements, and forage. Assign special personnel to keep them, and implement acceptance, handover, transfer, and borrowing procedures for storage and retrieval.
    Third, strengthen political work. After Party rectification and winter training, each farm will establish or improve Party and Communist Youth League general branches (or branches) and trade union organizations based on the foundations of the Party, Communist Youth League, and mass organizations, and actively and cautiously develop Party and mass organizations. At the same time, establish a Party propaganda network. It is necessary to equip cadres who specialize in political work, enrich the content of the Party and Communist Youth League organizations, strengthen leadership, and ensure that the Party on the farm will truly play the role of a fortress in supervising enterprises and ensuring production. Strengthen the county Party committee's political and ideological leadership over the farms, regularly discuss and send people to inspect the work of the farms, absorb farm cadres to participate in necessary meetings, and combine the leadership of the farms with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The farm itself must strengthen the political and ideological leadership of its employees and carry out criticism and self-criticism.
    The management and operation of the farm must be democratized. Leading cadres must establish the idea of relying on all employees to run the farm well and have a strong sense of enterprise, and overcome the patriarchal and supervisory leadership style. Farm leading cadres must go deep into production, learn agricultural technology, and become experts. Improve the democratic management committee, which must have one-third of agricultural worker representatives participating. The management committee regularly discusses major issues such as the farm's production plan, financial plan, production competition, collective contract, wages, and benefits. Hold employee conferences or representative conferences every quarter to review leadership and mobilize production. It is necessary to pay attention to employees' rational suggestions. Launch patriotic production increase competitions and give full play to the labor enthusiasm of employees.
    All farms are currently undergoing Party rectification and winter training. The content of Party rectification education mainly includes implementing the principles of socialist enterprise management, establishing the idea of economic accounting, establishing the idea of resolutely relying on all farm employees to run the farm well, and implementing the principles of democratic management. Educate employees to establish a long-term commitment to building the farm's cause and a sense of ownership, as well as a new attitude towards labor. Mobilize employees to check waste and phenomena of irresponsibility and bureaucracy.
    All farms should do a good job in preparing for increased production this winter, and intensively carry out manure delivery and fertilizer accumulation to ensure that the amount of manure applied to cultivated land reaches more than 70% in 1953. Demonstration farms should carefully select improved varieties with a purity of more than 95%. (Zhou Hai)

    中共黑龙江省委召开国营农场会议
    确定今年生产任务和改进经营管理的步骤
    中共黑龙江省委在去年十二月十六日召开国营农场会议（机械农场另外举行了专门会议），贯彻中共中央东北局关于国营农场的决定。会议检查了农场工作，并确定了今年全省国营农场的生产任务和改进经营管理的步骤。
    该省国营农场几年来从无到有，现在已发展到一百四十一处；在进行农场建设中，培养了干部，积    累了一些生产技术和经营管理的经验，为今后进一步发展打下有利基础。部分农场逐步改进耕作技术，多打了粮食，在群众中起了一定的示范作用。目前已有三十二处农场做到“生产有利”，有二十一处农场达到收支平衡。但是大部农场经营的不够好，还有资本主义经营思想和供给制思想。因此，农场的产量低、成本较高、浪费较大，有部分农场赔钱，农场政治工作薄弱，有的农场没有党、青年团的基层组织或党员、青年团员。工会会员只占农场职工的三分之一。
    会议针对以上情况进行了讨论，并根据东北局国营农场会议的精神，确定今年全省国营农场的主要任务是：巩固提高，进一步发挥示范作用，达到生产有利的方针，一般不再扩大。国营农场办得好坏的主要标准是，是否多打粮食和在农业生产上是否起到示范作用。各农场因此要积极改进农业技术，使用新农具，树立榜样，教育农民。必须克服忽视改进农业技术，盲目扩大耕地面积，不重视提高单位面积产量的偏向。同时，国营农场应尽可能在技术方面帮助和指导互助组及农业生产合作社，总结群众丰产技术经验，指导所在县的全县技术推广工作。国营农场并且要与农业技术推广站取得密切联系，定期组织群众到示范农场参观，组织实物展览，召开座谈会和技术研究会，与周围互助组、农业生产合作社订技术指导合同，传播技术经验。
    其次，要改善经营管理，提高生产效率，降低成本，克服浪费。一、冬季各场结合整党、整训，进行一次彻底的清产核资，确定经营范围，确定固定资金和流动资金，缩减不必要的经营部分和处理库存商品，补充流动资金的不足，经营土地的范围也要初步确定。在清产核资基础上建立成本管理制度。每垧成本不得超过收获量的百分之六十。为保证降低成本，必须实行定额管理，提高机械设备运用率。二、改进劳动组织，实行常年固定包耕制，在固定耕作区，固定生产队基础上确定产量指标，如年终有超额，实行奖励。在固定分队后，要进行必要的换工互助，开展生产竞赛。三、建立责任制，首先要建立耕畜饲养管理使用责任制和建立粮食、农具、草料账簿，指定专人保管，入库、出库实行接交验收转借等手续。
    第三，加强政治工作。经过冬季整党、整训，各农场根据党、青年团、群众组织的基础，建立或健全党、青年团总支（或支部）与工会组织，并积极慎重地发展党群组织，同时建立党的宣传网。要配备专作政治工作的干部，充实党、青年团组织的生活内容，加强领导，使今后农场的党切实起到监督企业、保证生产的堡垒作用。加强县委对农场的政治思想领导，定期讨论和派人检查农场工作，吸收农场干部参加必要的会议，把领导农场和互助合作运动结合起来。农场本身要加强对职工政治思想的领导，开展批评与自我批评。
    农场经营管理必须民主化，领导干部要建立依靠全体职工办好农场的思想和坚强的事业心，克服家长制和监工式的领导作风。农场领导干部必须深入生产，学习农业技术，变成内行。健全民主管理委员会，必须有三分之一农业工人代表参加。管理委员会定期讨论农场的生产计划、财务计划、生产竞赛、集体合同、工资福利等重大问题。每季召开职工大会或代表会，检查领导，动员生产。必须重视职工合理化的建议。要开展爱国增产竞赛，充分发挥职工的劳动积极性。
    各农场目前一律进行整党、冬训。整党教育内容主要是贯彻社会主义企业管理原则，建立经济核算制思想，树立坚决依靠全场职工办好农场的思想，贯彻民主管理化原则；教育职工树立长期建设农场事业心和主人翁的思想与新的劳动态度。发动职工检查浪费和无人负责、官僚主义的现象。
    各农场在冬季要做好增产准备工作，紧张地进行送粪、积肥，保证一九五三年上粪达到耕地面积百分之七十以上；示范农场要精选优良品种，纯度达百分之九十五以上。（周海）
