Soviet Hemolytic Therapy Cured My Hypertension

To the Editor:

I am a middle-aged man who has suffered from arteriosclerotic hypertension since the spring of 1949. At that time, my blood pressure was 170-210 mmHg systolic and 120-140 mmHg diastolic (my usual blood pressure was above 180 mmHg). As a result, my head always felt abnormally heavy, and my ventricles were enlarged and hypertrophied. The doctors in the hospital only gave me injections of antihypertensive drugs, internal iodine preparations, bloodletting, and bed rest. But all were ineffective. In 1952, I returned to work at the Hegang Mining Bureau from the Xi'an Cadre School of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration. At that time, the Hegang Mining Bureau Miners' Hospital was experimenting with the Soviet advanced medical hemolytic therapy, which cured many patients with hypertension (it is only ineffective for kidney-related hypertension). So I tried this therapy too. After two courses of treatment (each course lasting ten days), my blood pressure dropped from 204 mmHg to 150 mmHg. Now, I have recovered my health and returned to my job.

The process of hemolytic therapy is as follows: a certain amount of distilled water is drawn into a syringe, and then the needle is inserted into the patient's vein, a certain amount of blood is drawn out, and after the blood cells are destroyed, it is injected back into the vein. The ratio of distilled water to blood is as follows for each course of treatment: Day 1: 3 ml of distilled water, 7 ml of blood; Day 2: 4 ml of distilled water, 6 ml of blood; Day 3: 5 ml of distilled water, 5 ml of blood; Day 4: 6 ml of distilled water, 4 ml of blood; Day 5: 7 ml of distilled water, 3 ml of blood; Day 6: 7 ml of distilled water, 3 ml of blood; Day 7: 6 ml of distilled water, 4 ml of blood; Day 8: 5 ml of distilled water, 5 ml of blood; Day 9: 4 ml of distilled water, 6 ml of blood; Day 10: 3 ml of distilled water, 7 ml of blood. After one course of treatment, the doctor should check whether the patient's blood pressure has decreased. If it is found that the patient's blood pressure has not decreased, it can be determined that there are other causes or that this method is ineffective for him. If the blood pressure has decreased, but has not reached the normal value, then a second course of treatment can be continued.

I hope that hospitals in various places will study this method and promote it.

### 苏联的溶血疗法治好了我的高血压症

    苏联的溶血疗法治好了我的高血压症
    编辑同志：我是一个中年人，从一九四九年春就患有动脉硬化性的高血压症。当时的血压，高压是一百七十度至二百一十度，低压是一百二十至一百四十度（平时血压也在一百八十度以上），因此，我的头部总是感到异常沉重，心室也因而扩张肥大。医院里的大夫只是给我注射降血压的药品，内服碘剂，泄血，进行卧床疗养。但是都无效。一九五二年，我由东北煤矿管理局西安干部学校回到鹤岗矿务局工作。这时鹤岗矿务局矿工医院正在试行苏联先进医学的溶血疗法，治好了许多高血压症患者（它仅对肾脏性的高血压症无效）。于是我也试用了这一疗法。经过两个疗程（每一疗程为十天），我的血压已由二百零四度下降到一百五十度，现在，我已恢复健康，走上工作岗位。
    溶血疗法的过程是这样的：把一定数量的蒸馏水吸入注射器内，然后把针头插入病人的静脉内，吸出一定量的血，俟血球破坏后，再注回静脉。蒸馏水和血的溶合量的比例，每个疗程的分配是这样的：第一日，三公撮蒸馏水、七公撮血；第二日，四公撮蒸馏水、六公撮血；第三日，五公撮蒸馏水、五公撮血；第四日，六公撮蒸馏水、四公撮血；第五日，七公撮蒸馏水、三公撮血；第六日，七公撮蒸馏水、三公撮血；第七日，六公撮蒸馏水、四公撮血；第八日，五公撮蒸馏水、五公撮血；第九日，四公撮蒸馏水、六公撮血；第十日，三公撮蒸馏水、七公撮血。经过一个疗程，医师就要检查病人的血压是否下降，如果发现病人的血压没有下降，即可判定其另有其它病因，或此法对他无效；如果血压已见下降，但未达到正常数，则可继续进行第二个疗程。
    希望各地医院对此法进行研究，并予以推广。
