Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Vietnamese and Chinese People
Shishan, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association

On January 18, 1950, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was the first to recognize the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as the legal government representing the will of the Vietnamese people, and officially established diplomatic relations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Subsequently, the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries established diplomatic relations with the Vietnamese government. The Vietnamese people cherish and value this historic day, because it marks a new stage in the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people.

Vietnam and China have had a close relationship of interdependence since ancient times. For thousands of years, the people of both countries suffered under the cruel exploitation of the feudal system, and in the past century, they have both been ravaged by imperialism. Therefore, they can deeply understand the pain of being oppressed, and in the long struggle against imperialism and feudalism, they have often supported each other. For decades, every major revolutionary movement in China has directly influenced the revolutionary struggle in Vietnam. The glorious victory of the Chinese people in 1949 strengthened the Vietnamese people's belief in the success of their own revolutionary cause. At the same time, it gave Vietnam a vast, powerful, and friendly neighbor, guaranteeing the final victory of Vietnam's national liberation struggle. In addition, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of fraternal diplomatic relations between the governments of Vietnam and China greatly inspired the more than 800,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, who gave even more sympathy and support to the Vietnamese resistance.

In his New Year's Day telegram to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in 1950, President Ho Chi Minh said:

"The brotherly friendship between the people of Vietnam and China has a history of thousands of years. In the future, this friendship will become even closer, further developing the freedom and happiness of the people of both countries and safeguarding lasting peace in the world."

Chairman Mao Zedong said in his reply: "The people of China and Vietnam stand on the front line against imperialism. With the victory of the people of both countries, the friendship between the people of both countries will become increasingly consolidated."

The facts are indeed so. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and China, the friendship between the people of Vietnam and China has been consolidated day by day.

In early 1950, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association was established. Its purpose is to exchange information and experiences about the construction and struggles of the people of Vietnam and China, and to enhance the friendship and cooperation between the people of the two countries.

In early 1951, President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam specially appointed Comrade Hoang Van Hoan as the Ambassador-level representative of the Vietnamese delegation to China.

In July 1951, the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, led by Comrade Hoang Quoc Viet, visited New China. For major festivals such as the National Day of the People's Republic of China on October 1st and International Labor Day on May 1st, the Vietnamese people sent delegations to New China to attend the celebrations. These delegations visited various parts of China, learned from the Chinese people's experiences, and further strengthened the friendship between the people of the two countries. These delegations were honored to receive warm and friendly receptions from the Chinese government and the Chinese people, making each of the delegates feel as warm as if they were in their own country during their stay in China.

The Vietnamese people deeply understand the sincere friendship of the Chinese people. In early 1952, when the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China returned home to report to various places, the people in various parts of Vietnam sincerely expressed their brotherly love and affection for the great Chinese people. In many areas, people temporarily put down their work in order to personally hear the delegation's report on their visit to China, walking 60 to 80 li, crossing mountains and rivers, and bringing dry food. What was particularly moving was that the people in the enemy-occupied areas risked their lives to cross the enemy's blockade line to listen to the reports. In the reports, every time they heard the news of the Chinese people's victory, or heard about the Chinese people's sincere friendship towards the Vietnamese people, the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people!" and the storm of applause lasted for a long time.

The Vietnamese people are always concerned about the construction achievements of the Chinese people, especially the glorious victories constantly achieved by the Chinese people in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in the past two years, the great achievements of land reform, the remarkable achievements of the nationwide patriotic health campaign, and the great achievements of starting the first five-year plan in large-scale economic construction today. Some of the valuable films given by the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people have been shown in many places and have received the highest praise. Vietnamese translations of Chinese books and plays are enthusiastically loved by the broad masses of the Vietnamese people. Because these works with high ideological and artistic value fully illustrate that the Chinese people are vigorously moving forward in culture. From these works, the Vietnamese people further understand the source of the Chinese people's heroic struggle and great victory. The Vietnamese people clearly see that the Chinese people are exerting infinite creative abilities and potential strength, and are actively building a prosperous and strong New China. The Vietnamese people are determined to learn from the Chinese people's fighting spirit and rich experience on all fronts.

All these facts show that the brotherly friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people is becoming increasingly close. In the enemy-occupied areas, French colonialists and traitors often spread lies. They often make trouble over those disputes that occurred between Vietnam and China in the feudal era, in an attempt to alienate the long-standing friendly feelings between the people of the two countries. They fabricate out of thin air that Vietnam is being threatened by red China, in an attempt to split the friendship and cooperation between the people of the two countries. However, due to the continuous great victories of the Vietnamese and Chinese people, and due to the increasingly consolidated friendship between the people of Vietnam and China, these cunning slanders of the enemy and puppets have been shattered, and their evil conspiracy to occupy Vietnam as a springboard for attacking New China has also been shattered. We are convinced that the friendship between the people of Vietnam and China is an important force for striving for peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Celebrating the establishment of friendly diplomatic relations between the people of Vietnam and China, the Vietnamese people sincerely express their infinitely deep feelings for the Chinese people. We thank our closest and always supportive dear friends—the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people.

Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese government, the Vietnamese people are determined to rely on their own efforts and wage a long-term resistance war to win complete independence and unity, and to build a free and happy new democratic Vietnam. The friendship between the people of Vietnam and China, built on this foundation, will be permanent and unbreakable!

    越中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁
    越中友好协会会长　诗山
    一九五○年一月十八日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府首先承认越南民主共和国政府是代表越南人民意志的合法政府，并和越南民主共和国政府正式建立邦交。接着苏联和各人民民主国家相继和越南政府建立外交关系。越南人民非常珍爱和重视这个具有历史性的日子，因为这标志着越中两国人民的友谊已进入一个新的阶段。
    越中两国很早以来就有唇齿相依的密切关系。几千年来两国人民都在封建制度残酷的压榨下，近一世纪来两国人民都同样备受帝国主义的蹂躏，所以彼此能深刻地体会到被压迫的痛苦，因而在反帝反封建的长期斗争中，能经常互相支援。几十年来，中国每一次轰轰烈烈的革命运动，都直接影响到越南的革命斗争。一九四九年中国人民光辉的胜利，加强了越南人民对自己的革命事业成功的信念，同时也使越南有一个幅员广阔、无比强大的友好的邻邦，保证了越南的民族解放斗争获得最后的胜利。此外，中国人民革命的胜利和越中两国政府建立兄弟般的邦交，使为数八十多万的旅越华侨无限振奋，对越南的抗战更加予以同情和支援。
    在一九五○年元旦，胡志明主席致中华人民共和国中央人民政府的贺电说：
    “越中两国人民兄弟般的友谊已有数千年的历史，今后这个友谊将更加紧密起来，进而发展两国人民的自由和幸福，并保卫世界的持久和平。”
    毛泽东主席在复电中说：“中越两国人民都站在反帝国主义的战线上，随着两国人民的胜利，两国人民之间的友谊将日趋于巩固。”
    事实确系如此，自越中建交这一天起，越中两国人民的友谊正一天比一天巩固起来。
    一九五○年初，越中友好协会成立了。它的目的是交流越中两国人民的建设和战斗的情况和经验，增强两国人民间的友好与合作。
    一九五一年初，胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府特委任黄文欢同志为驻华代表团大使衔代表。
    一九五一年七月间，以黄国越同志为首的越南人民访华代表团到新中国访问，重大的节日如十月一日中华人民共和国国庆节、五月一日国际劳动节，越南人民都派出代表团赴新中国观礼。这些代表团曾到过中国各地参观，学习了中国人民的各种经验，并进一步地密切了两国间人民的友谊。这些代表团都很荣幸地得到中国人民政府和中国人民热烈地、友爱地招待，使这些代表们个个都感到在中国期间所受到的温暖，无异于在自己的国内。
    越南人民是深切地了解了中国人民真挚的友谊的。一九五二年初，当越南人民访华代表团返国分赴各地作报告的时候，越南各地人民真诚地流露出对伟大的中国人民兄弟般的爱戴。许多地区的人民为要亲自听到代表团作访问中国的报告，特暂时放下工作，步行六十至八十华里的路程，翻山越岭、涉溪渡河，带着干粮赶来。尤其令人感动的是敌占区的人民，不惜冒着生命的危险，越过敌军封锁线去听报告。在报告中，每次听到中国人民胜利的消息、或是听到叙述中国人民对越南人民真挚的友谊的时候，“毛泽东主席万岁！越中人民友好万岁！”的欢呼声和暴风雨般的鼓掌声经久不息。
    越南人民经常关心着中国人民的建设成就，特别是两年来中国人民在抗美援朝运动中不断获得的光辉的胜利，土地改革的巨大成就和全国规模的爱国卫生运动的卓越的成绩、以及今天在大规模经济建设中开始第一个五年计划的伟大业绩。中国人民送给越南人民的一些名贵影片，在许多地方放映，都获得最高的评价。中国书籍和剧本的越文译本得到越南广大人民群众热烈的爱好。因为这些具有高度思想性和艺术性的作品，充分说明中国人民在文化方面正在有力地迈步前进。越南人民从这些作品中，更进一步地了解到中国人民英勇的斗争和伟大胜利的泉源。越南人民清楚地看到中国人民正在发挥着无穷的创造能力和潜在力量，积极地在建设一个繁荣富强的新中国。越南人民决心学习中国人民在各条战线上的战斗精神和丰富的经验。
    以上这些事实，正说明着越中两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊日益密切。在敌占区，法国殖民者和叛国分子经常散布谎言，它们时常把越中两国在封建时代里发生的那些纷争事件，兴风作浪，妄图离间两国人民久已存在的友好感情，它们凭空捏造地说什么越南正受着赤色中国的威胁，想借此来分裂两国人民的友好和合作。但由于越中两国人民不断地获得巨大的胜利，由于越中两国人民间友谊的日趋于巩固，已粉碎了敌伪这些狡诈的谰言，同时也粉碎了它们梦想占领越南作为进攻新中国的跳板的罪恶阴谋。我们确信：越中两国人民之间的友谊是争取东南亚与世界的和平的重要力量。
    庆祝越中两国人民建立友好邦交，越南全国人民真情流露地表示着他们对中国人民无限深厚的感情。感谢我们最亲密的、一向支持我们的挚友——中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席、中国共产党、中国人民政府和中国人民。
    越南人民在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南政府的领导下，正在自力更生的基础上，决心长期抗战争取完全的独立和统一，来建设一个自由、幸福的新民主主义的越南。在这样的基础上建立起来的越中两国人民间的友谊，将是永久的、牢不可破的！
