Xinhua News Agency, 29th: As the Spring Festival is approaching, the Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce issued instructions on January 24th to fully meet the people's needs for various festival goods during the Spring Festival. The instructions stipulated that state-owned commercial departments in all regions must supply a large quantity of Spring Festival materials to ensure the people's needs during the festival. The instructions stated: All regions must fully prepare their forces to prepare for major festival materials such as flour, rice, pork, eggs, and daily-use industrial products. With the close cooperation of state-owned companies and cooperatives, materials should be prepared and arranged properly according to the needs of the masses in various regions to ensure a sufficient supply and strictly prevent any out-of-stock situations. At the same time, attention should also be paid to organizing and mobilizing private businesses to actively participate in the transportation and supply of festival goods. However, it is necessary to strictly restrict behaviors such as raising prices and speculation. Speculators who attempt to disrupt the market should be managed. The instructions also pointed out that commercial administrative departments at all levels should immediately conduct inspections on the supply of goods to the market by various specialized companies, retail companies, cooperatives, and private merchants. It is also necessary to prevent the negligence of insufficient attention to market supply that may occur due to the state-owned commercial institutions implementing an economic accounting system, verifying funds, and clearing assets. It is also important to overcome the erroneous thinking among some leading cadres of state-owned commercial institutions, which may arise due to the implementation of the economic accounting system, that they are not responsible for market supply. The instructions finally require all commercial administrative departments, state-owned commercial institutions, cooperatives, and private merchants to attach importance to the Spring Festival supply work, ensure the sufficient supply of people's daily consumer goods, and enable the people of the whole country to spend the Spring Festival happily with completely stable prices.

    中央商业部指示各地国营商业部门
    充分供应春节物资保证人民需要
    【新华社二十九日讯】春节即将到来，中央人民政府商业部为了充分满足春节期间人民对各种应节商品的需要，特于一月二十四日发出指示，规定各地国营商业部门必须大量供应春节物资，保证人民节期需要。指示说：各地必须充分准备力量，对应节主要物资如面粉、大米、猪肉、鸡蛋、以及日用工业品等做好准备工作，在国营公司与合作社的密切配合下，根据各地群众需要，把物资准备、摆布妥当，进行充分供应，严防任何脱销现象。同时并应注意组织、动员私营商业积极参加应节物资的贩运和供应工作，但须严格限制哄抬价格、投机居奇的行为，对企图波动市场的投机商人，应加管理。指示并指出各级商业行政部门，应立即对各专业公司、零售公司、合作社与私商组织货源供应市场的情况，进行检查，并须防止由于国营商业机构正在推行经济核算制，核定资金，清理资产，因而可能发生的对市场供应注意不足的疏忽现象，并克服由于实行经济核算制，在某些国营商业机构领导干部中可能产生的对市场供应不负责任的错误思想。该指示最后要求所有的商业行政部门、国营商业机构、合作社与私商重视春节供应工作，保证人民日用消费品的充分供给，使全国人民能够在物价的完全稳定中愉快地度过春节。
