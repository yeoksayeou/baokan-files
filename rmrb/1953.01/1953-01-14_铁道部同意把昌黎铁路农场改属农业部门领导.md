Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published letters on November 20th and December 3rd, 1952, from twelve agricultural workers, including Yu Yongzhong, and farmer representatives from the Song De'en mountain fruit region, suggesting that the Changli Railway Farm be transferred to the leadership of the agricultural department. We believe that the suggestion to hand over this farm to the leadership of the agricultural department is reasonable. We specifically conducted research with the Tianjin Railway Administration and the leaders of the Changli Railway Farm. Considering that the fruit tree varieties of this farm are among the best in North China, transferring it to the leadership of the agricultural department will allow for greater promotion of excellent varieties, which is beneficial for the country's large-scale economic construction. Therefore, we agree with everyone's suggestion and have decided to transfer the farm to the leadership of the agricultural department. However, we would like to state here that, according to our understanding, the staff of the farm have been working hard in recent years, and the farm has developed. Of course, the purpose of the railway operating this farm is different from the purpose of the agricultural department, and it has not been able to reach the ideal level of specialization. However, it must be stated that all income of the farm since liberation has been turned over to the state treasury, and it is not an ordinary agency production. Because of this matter, it took some time to understand and exchange opinions back and forth, and the reply in the newspaper is very late. We hope that the comrades and readers who made the suggestions will forgive us.
    Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    铁道部同意把昌黎铁路农场改属农业部门领导
    编辑同志：一九五二年十一月二十日、十二月三日人民日报连续刊登了于用中等十二位农业工作者及宋德恩等山果区农民代表的信，建议昌黎铁路农场改属农业部门领导，我们认为将这一农场交给农业部门领导的建议是合理的。我们专门和天津铁路管理局以及昌黎铁路农场领导人作了研究。鉴于该农场果木品种在华北为有数之品种，改归农业部门领导以后，可收更大地推广优良品种之效，这对于国家大规模经济建设，是有利的。因此我们同意大家的建议，决将该农场移交农业部门领导。但我们附带在此声明：据我们了解，几年以来，该农场的职工们的工作是努力的，农场是有发展的。当然，铁路经营这个农场的目的和农业部门的目的不同，未能在专业化上达到理想的程度。但该农场从解放以来，所有收入均缴国库，不是一般的机关生产，这一点是要加以说明的。因为这件事情，往返了解和交换意见，费了一些时间，在报上答复很迟，希望提意见的同志和读者们加以原谅。
