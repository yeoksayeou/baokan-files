Xinhua News Agency, London, January 27th:  British newspapers are increasingly frequently carrying news about British monopoly capitalists attempting to regain the position they have lost in competition with American monopoly capitalists.  Recently, the chief designer of the Bristol Aircraft Factory told the factory's shareholders meeting that in planning aircraft production, the British aircraft industry must take drastic measures sufficient to shake the export position of the United States.  The "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of London business circles, pointed out that sharp competition exists between British and American aircraft manufacturers.
    British monopoly capitalists are desperately striving to seize territory from American monopoly capitalists in the Canadian market. In 1951, the number of British machine tools imported by Canada accounted for about one-seventh of the total number of machine tools imported, while in 1952, the proportion of British-made machine tools increased to one-sixth. The "Financial Times" pointed out that Canadian orders were obtained in an exceptionally fierce competition with the United States.

    英垄断资本家拚命努力
    企图从美国夺回销货市场
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国报纸上越来越经常地刊载关于英国垄断资本家企图恢复他们在与美国垄断资本家竞争中所失去的地位的消息。最近布利斯托尔飞机厂的首席设计师在该厂股东大会上说：英国飞机工业在计划飞机生产方面，必须采取足以动摇美国出口地位的激烈手段。伦敦商业界的喉舌“金融时报”指出：英美两国飞机制造商之间正存在着尖锐的竞争。
    英国垄断资本家们正在拚命地努力，企图在加拿大市场上从美国垄断资本家手里夺取地盘。在一九五一年，加拿大输入的工作母机总数中，英国工作母机的数量大约占七分之一，而在一九五二年，英国制造的工作母机所占的比率已增加到六分之一了。“金融时报”指出：加拿大的定货是在与美国进行异常剧烈的竞争中得到的。
