Soil and Water Conservation is a Long-Term Work of Transforming Nature

Some people say, "Zha Shan Gou is soil and water conservation work." Some people say, "Building terraces is soil and water conservation work." Still others say, "Closing hillsides for afforestation is soil and water conservation work." Yes, these are all soil and water conservation work. But if you isolate one item as soil and water conservation work and think that the others are not soil and water conservation work, then this is wrong, because this will not truly achieve the purpose of maintaining soil and water. The scope of soil and water conservation work is very wide. According to the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Mobilizing the Masses to Continue to Carry out Drought Prevention and Resistance Movements and Vigorously Promote Soil and Water Conservation Work," it should include "afforestation and grass planting on mountainous hills and plateaus with a plan to close hillsides, and prohibit opening steep slopes, so as to conserve water flow and consolidate topsoil. At the same time, advanced farming methods should be promoted, such as building terraces, picking dry canals, contour planting and pasture rotation, so that the rainwater that falls will be infiltrated in place as much as possible, slowing down the flow, so as not to form a scouring flow and flow rate. For mountain streams and gullies that have been scoured, silt dams and slow-flow dams should be built from top to bottom, from small to large, first the tributaries and then the main gullies, to change the longitudinal slope of the gullies, delay the speed of flood discharge, intercept the sediment carried by the discharge, and the silted land can increase production." The purpose of soil and water conservation work is to prevent soil erosion, maintain soil and water, and fundamentally overcome natural disasters such as water and drought, so that the bare rocky mountains and the increasingly barren gullies and ravines will become mountains protected by forests and pastures, and fertile fields; and to turn mountain torrents and rivers that breach their banks into clear water rivers with a steady flow. In short, we must truly achieve that all mountains are green and all water is clear. This is a long-term work of transforming nature that must be implemented step by step from now on to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction.

The Causes and Consequences of Soil Erosion

Due to the long-term destruction of mountain forests in the past and the unplanned cultivation of hills and mountains, many areas have exposed soil and rocks, losing the ability to conserve rainwater, resulting in serious soil erosion. This is not only the main cause of mountain floods and river siltation in various places, but also makes the soil in mountainous plateau areas increasingly barren and production increasingly declines. According to a survey by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the tributaries of the Yellow River from Tuoketuo to Mengjin: the Wuding River, Yan River, Jing River, Wei River, and Luo River, etc., carry 800 million cubic meters of soil into the Yellow River every year. Because these rivers all flow through the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi and Gansu, loess has special physical properties and is most easily eroded by running water. The water flow in the slope can flow down along the vertical cracks between the loess, causing sinkholes and finally collapsing into soil ditches. The soil ditches develop to both sides year after year, and finally become gully-like valleys. The thousands of gullies and ravines in the Loess Plateau area today are the result of years of soil being eroded by rainwater. At present, nearly one-third of the fertile loess in the Northwest region has become gullies. In northern Shaanxi, where scouring is particularly severe, 50% of the area has become gullies. If this erosion phenomenon is not stopped, not only will the area of gullies continue to expand and increase, and the area of farmland will be reduced day by day, but also the surge of mountain floods will become more serious. If the mountain flood problem is not solved, the water disaster cannot be eradicated, and even the life of the mountain valley reservoirs we are now building will be affected.

How to Do a Good Job in Soil and Water Conservation

There are many ways to maintain soil and water. In order to prevent soil erosion in farmland, it is first necessary to reduce surface runoff (running water). Deep plowing in fields with thicker soil can help rainwater infiltrate and retain moisture; applying more organic fertilizer and rational crop rotation can increase the organic matter contained in the soil, improve the soil's aggregate structure, and increase the soil's water infiltration and water storage capacity. Northwest farmers often rotate alfalfa with crops, which not only provides a large amount of feed for livestock, but also improves the soil structure. The second is to prevent rainwater from directly impacting the ground. The degree of erosion in fields planted with millet and beans is often smaller than that in fields planted with sorghum and corn. Intercropping sorghum, corn and beans is an effective way to prevent soil erosion in many areas of our country. The third method is to build ditches and ridges in the fields to hold rainwater. Farmers in Renshou, Sichuan, dig flat ridges along the contour direction of sweet potato fields and practice contour farming. Farmers in Guizhou divide sloping land into many small areas with soil ridges to plant sugarcane, so that all rainwater can be stored in the fields, and crop yields are greatly increased.

On gentle slopes, the slope of runoff must be changed to reduce the scouring force of water. Northwest farmers often dig slightly inclined diversion ditches horizontally on slopes to intercept rainwater flowing down from the slopes and then discharge it along the ditches. Digging "dry canals" by farmers in the mountainous areas of western Henan is also a measure to reduce flow velocity and scouring force. However, on steeper slopes, the slopes must be terraced. Many terraces in the Taihang Mountains are built extremely flat, with field ridges made of stone or soil; the outer edges of the terraces in Mixian County, Henan, are raised and slightly inclined inward, forming dish-shaped fields. In such fields, soil and water loss can be avoided. The rice terraces in Sichuan are world-renowned soil and water conservation projects. Because they are very flat, erosion can be almost completely avoided.

On steep slopes exceeding 30 degrees, or slopes and barren hills that have been eroded to the point where they cannot be cultivated, forests or turf should be used to protect them. Dense forests and pastures are a powerful weapon to prevent soil erosion. Stopping cultivation on steep slopes and returning forests to plant grass is an important step in soil and water conservation. The Dabie Mountains in northern Anhui have gained good experience in returning cultivated land to forests. In the past three years, we have closed off more than 54 million mu of barren hills and cultivated them into young forests. Many steep slopes and barren hills that were cultivated in the past have begun to be afforested or converted into pastures. Many soil-retaining plants, such as Vitex, kudzu, sweet clover, Amorpha fruticosa, and alfalfa, are being used to green barren hills and change the natural appearance of mountainous areas.

In gullies, valley workshop projects should be built, dams should be built section by section to change the longitudinal slope of the gullies, and floods should be intercepted and water stored. Shandong's "Zha Shan Gou" and northern Shaanxi's "Dam Nian" have become mass movements. After the valley workshop is built, it can also be silted to increase production. The land silted up in the dam and Nian in northern Shaanxi is often the first-class farmland, and its yield is five to ten times higher than that of ordinary slopes. However, relying solely on valley workshop projects cannot completely control the expansion of gullies. It is also necessary to plant soil-retaining plants such as kudzu, Imperata cylindrica, Vitex, and Robinia pseudoacacia on the gully banks and gully tops. The valley workshop project in the Raoyang River Basin in Northeast China is a very prominent example, because the forestry department did not cooperate with the water conservancy department to plant forests in the areas where the valley workshops were built, so that the completed valley workshop projects could not achieve the desired results.

    什么叫水土保持，怎样做好水土保持工作

    水土保持工作是长期改造自然的工作
    有人说：“闸山沟是水土保持工作”。有人说：“修梯田是水土保持工作”。还有人说：“封山育林是水土保持工作”。是的，这些都是水土保持工作。但是如果孤立地认为某一项是水土保持工作，其他的就不是水土保持工作，这就是错误的，因为这样就不能真正达到保持水土的目的。水土保持工作的范围很广，根据政务院“关于发动群众继续开展防旱、抗旱运动并大力推行水土保持工作的指示”，它应包括“在山区丘陵和高原地带有计划地封山、造林、种草和禁开陡坡，以涵蓄水流和巩固表土，同时应推行先进的耕作方法，如修梯田、挑旱渠、等高种植和牧草轮作等办法，期使降落的雨水尽量就地渗入，缓和下流，不致形成冲刷的流势和流量。对于已经冲刷的山溪沟壑，即应先支沟，后干沟，自上而下，由小而大地修筑拦沙坝和缓流坝，以改变沟壑纵向的坡度，延缓洪水下泄的速度，截留其挟带下泄的泥沙，淤出的土地并可增加生产”。水土保持工作的目的，是要防止土壤侵蚀，保持水土，从根本上克服水、旱等自然灾害，使岩石裸露的童秃的山岭、日益瘠薄的沟壑纵横的原野，变成有林木、牧草保护的山岭和肥沃的原野；把洪水横流的山洪和决堤泛滥的河流变成细水长流的清水河，总之，要真正做到有山皆绿，无水不清。这是随着国家大规模经济建设的需要，必须从现在起就按部就班逐步实现的长期的改造自然的工作。水土流失的原因和后果
    由于过去山林长期被破坏，丘陵山地无计划的垦植，使很多地区土石裸露，失去涵蓄雨水的能力，造成了严重的土壤侵蚀现象。这不但是各地山洪为害和河道淤塞的主要原因，而且使山陵高原地带土壤日益瘠薄，生产日益衰退。据黄河水利委员会调查，黄河由托克托到孟津的支流：无定河、延水、泾水、渭水、洛水等河流，每年流进黄河的泥土就有八万万立方公尺。因为这些河流都流经陕甘黄土地带，黄土具有特殊的物理性质，最容易受流水侵蚀。坡地中的水流能顺着黄土间直立的缝隙下流，造成陷穴，最后崩溃成土沟。土沟年复一年地向两旁发展，最后就变成了沟壑式山谷。现在黄土地区中的千沟万壑，都是历年土壤被雨水冲刷侵蚀的后果。目前西北地区肥沃的黄土，已有近三分之一的面积成了沟壑，冲洗特别厉害的陕北地区，已有百分之五十的面积变成了沟壑。这种冲刷侵蚀的现象，如不设法制止，不但沟壑面积仍将日渐扩展增加，农田面积日见缩减，同时山洪的汹涌也将更形严重。山洪问题不得解决，就不能根除水患，连我们现在兴修的山谷水库的寿命，也将受到影响。
    怎样做好水土保持工作
    保持水土的方法是多种多样的。为了防止农田土壤冲刷，首先要减少地面的迳流（流水）。在土层较厚的田地上实行深耕，可以帮助雨水的渗透，保持水分；多施有机肥料和合理轮作，能增加土壤里包含的有机质，改良土壤的团粒构造，增加土壤渗水和蓄水的能力。西北农民常把紫花苜蓿和作物轮作，不但供给牲畜大量的饲料，同时也改良了土壤结构。其次就是防止雨水直接冲击地面。种植谷子、豆类的田地的冲刷程度常较种植高粱、玉米的田地为小，我国许多地区的高粱、玉米和豆类间作，这是一种防止土壤冲刷的有效办法。第三种办法是在田地中修筑沟垅，容蓄雨水。四川仁寿等地农民把甘薯地按横坡方向挑成一条平垅，实行等高耕作；贵州农民把坡地用土埂分成许多小区种植甘蔗，使全部雨水能贮蓄在田地里，作物产量大大提高。
    在缓坡地上必须改变迳流的坡度，以减少水的冲刷力。西北农民常在坡地上横挖略带倾斜的分水沟，拦截坡上流下来的雨水，然后顺沟排出。豫西山地农民挑挖“旱渠”，也是减缓流速和冲刷力的措施。但在较陡的坡地上必须把坡地修成梯田。太行山区许多梯田砌得极为平整，并有用石埂或土培成的地埂；河南密县的梯田外缘抬高，略略向内倾斜，形成碟状的田地，在这样的田地中，水土流失可以避免。四川的水稻梯田，是世界驰名的水土保持工程，由于它很平整，几乎可以避免冲刷现象。
    在超过三十度的陡坡，或已经冲刷到不能种作物的坡地和荒山，要用森林或草皮来保护它。茂密的森林和牧草是防止土壤侵蚀的一个有力武器。停垦陡坡还林种草，是水土保持中一项重要步骤。皖北大别山区在停垦还林方面，已取得了很好的经验。三年来我们已有五千四百余万亩荒山经过封禁，培育成了幼林。有不少过去垦种的陡坡和荒山，已在开始造林或改为牧场。许多保土植物，如荆条、葛藤、草木樨、紫穗槐、紫花苜蓿，正在被用来绿化荒山，改变山区自然面貌。
    在沟壑里要修筑谷坊工程，节节筑坝，改变沟壑纵向的坡度，拦洪蓄水。山东的“闸山沟”和陕北的“打坝埝”，已成为群众性的运动。谷坊修筑后，还可以淤地，增加生产。在陕北的坝埝留淤地，往往是头等的庄稼地，它的产量要比一般坡地高出五至十倍。然而单靠谷坊工程，还不能完全控制沟壑的扩展，还需要在沟岸上、沟顶上，种植葛藤、斑茅、荆条、洋槐等保土植物。东北饶阳河流域的谷坊工程是一个很显著的例子，因为林业部门没有配合水利部门在修建谷坊的地区造林，使已完成的谷坊工程不能收到应有的效果。
