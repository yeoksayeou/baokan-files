To Commander Peng of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and all commanders, fighters, staff officers, political workers, logistics personnel, and cultural and health workers:
On this New Year's Day of 1953, we extend our warmest congratulations and highest respect to you on behalf of the people of the whole country, and express our sincere condolences to the comrades who were gloriously wounded or sickened by overwork.
For more than two years, in order to defend the independence and freedom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to defend the security of the motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, you have fought bravely and incomparably with the Korean People's Army, and have won great victories. The people of the whole country thank you from the bottom of their hearts, love you, and cheer for your great victory!
However, the American aggressors are still continuing and conspiring to expand the Korean War. Therefore, we must continue to fight to completely defeat the American's evil plan to continue and expand the war of aggression, to strive for the final victory of the Korean War, and to realize peace in Korea and the Far East.
Dear comrades, the people of the whole country assure you: We will continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea with all our strength, strengthen national economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction, and support you with greater strength! We believe that with the strong support of the people of the whole country, and with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, you will surely be able to achieve greater victories in the war against aggression together with the Korean People's Army.
We wish you a Happy New Year and good health!
