    Recently, U.S. military aircraft invading Korea have repeatedly violated our Northeast China's airspace, carrying out bombing raids, and sending special agent aircraft to conduct strategic reconnaissance of our country. At the same time, U.S. naval aircraft and warships have been intruding into our South China Sea for days. The intensified aggressive activities of U.S. aircraft and naval vessels in invading our country are clearly a prelude to the U.S. aggressors' long-prepared actions to expand the Korean War. This cannot but arouse the anger and animosity of our people. The statement issued by our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai on the 21st of this month fully expresses this anger of our people.
    The United States unilaterally announced the suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations three and a half months ago. During this period, the United States ordered its negotiating representatives to continue to suspend the Korean armistice negotiations; at the same time, it rejected the Soviet Union's just proposal for an immediate ceasefire and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the United Nations General Assembly, and manipulated its voting machine to pass the Indian proposal that facilitates the United States' expansion of its war of aggression. At the same time, the new U.S. President Eisenhower, who used the promise of "ending the Korean War" to win votes, openly clamored in his inaugural address: "We must be prepared to dare to do everything for our country," and he also asked the American people to "gladly accept any sacrifice that is asked of us." This makes it even clearer that neither the Truman administration nor the Eisenhower administration has any intention of "ending the Korean War." On the contrary, they are doing their utmost to undermine all possibilities and hopes for ending the Korean War.
    Harboring such malicious intentions, the U.S. aggressors are willing to "do everything." The U.S. aggressors have long violated the neutral zone agreement of the Korean armistice negotiations, constantly sending U.S. military aircraft to intrude into the Panmunjom meeting area, and on the 15th of this month, they openly tore up the agreement on the non-attack of delegation supply vehicles by means of a unilateral notification, attempting to use this to completely break down the armistice negotiations so that they could expand the Korean War. Nokes, the former official spokesman for the U.S. delegation, stated to reporters on the 19th of this month: "The Korean armistice negotiations will absolutely not resume in the same place." The U.S. aggressors' ambition to completely destroy the Korean armistice negotiations is no longer concealable.
    Now, U.S. military aircraft invading Korea have repeatedly violated our Northeast and other regions' airspace and are conducting strategic reconnaissance of our Northeast region, which further exposes the U.S.'s sinister ambition to expand the war. This is a further act of barbarous provocation taken by the U.S. aggressors when they have suffered heavy defeats on the Korean battlefield, when their tricks to force our side to submit in the Korean armistice negotiations have also failed, when even their inhuman germ warfare has failed, and when even their manipulation of the United Nations to pass the illegal resolution on forcibly detaining prisoners of war has been of no avail. The U.S. aggressors believe that this will force us to compromise with their violence, so as to restore their prestige in the capitalist world, especially in their Asian client states, which is declining due to the failure of the Korean War, and to achieve their goal of further plundering and suppressing the people of Asian countries.
    Our people must not ignore this sinister conspiracy of the U.S. aggressors, and must fully recognize the serious significance of the U.S.'s new provocations against our country. According to a dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th from the China News Agency, the commander of the U.S. invading army's Far East Air Force, Weyland, openly clamored in Tokyo that he "is prepared to bomb the Chinese mainland if Eisenhower orders him to do so." It can be seen from this that the recent continuous bombing of our Northeast by the U.S. invading Korean Air Force and the intrusions of U.S. naval aircraft and warships into our South China Sea are precisely the prelude to this kind of aggressive behavior. U.S. officials, congressmen, and reactionary American newspapers have recently been making arrogant propaganda about the various secret deployments and actions of the Eisenhower clique in preparing to expand the war of aggression, without any concealment. This is something that all peace-loving and kind people around the world and the people of Asian countries absolutely cannot ignore.
    The Chinese people, who have been fighting for a long time, cannot be intimidated by any of the imperialists' conspiracies and aggressive actions. The U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to expand the Korean War and attack our country will only be met with more resolute blows from the Chinese and Korean people. Since our people have been able to carry out the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea while accelerating the completion of the restoration of industry and agriculture for more than two years, then our people are now even more confident that they can carry out economic construction while intensifying the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In the past two years of the Korean War, the U.S. aggressors used one-third of their army, one-quarter of their air force, and most of their navy, and gathered the forces of more than a dozen client states, and still suffered heavy defeats in the war, causing the U.S. and its vassal troops to suffer more than 736,000 casualties, including more than 320,000 U.S. troops. The U.S. aggressors are therefore facing numerous difficulties, their morale is extremely low, and soldiers are deserting in large numbers. The various client states are therefore even more hesitant and unwilling to continue to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the U.S. aggressors. Under these circumstances, the U.S. aggressors' plan to expand the war of aggression is completely a dead end of their own making. The U.S. aggressors' attempt to use the Li Chengwan puppet army and the Kuomintang remnant bandit army as their capital to reverse their defeat and expand the war of aggression fully demonstrates the serious difficulties facing the sinister conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.
    The current task of our people is to vigorously carry out national construction while remaining highly vigilant against the enemy's conspiracy to expand the war and attack our country, which they are intensifying day and night. We must become more vigilant and continue to strengthen the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. If the enemy dares to take risks, we must ensure that the enemy suffers the most serious defeat.

### 高度警惕美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋

    高度警惕美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋
    侵朝美军飞机最近又连续侵犯我国东北领空，施行轰炸，并派遣特务飞机对我国进行战略侦察。与此同时，美国海军飞机和舰艇也连日窜扰我国南海。美国飞机和海军舰艇加紧侵犯我国的这种侵略活动，显然是美国侵略者久已准备的扩大侵朝战争行动的先声，这不能不引起我国人民的愤怒和敌忾情绪。我国外交部部长周恩来本月二十一日所发表的声明，充分表达了我国人民的这种愤怒情绪。
    美国片面宣布停止朝鲜停战谈判已经三个半月了。在这期间，美国一面令其谈判代表继续中止朝鲜停战谈判；一面在联合国大会上拒绝了苏联的立即停战并和平解决朝鲜问题的公正建议，而操纵其表决机器通过了便于美国扩大侵略战争的印度提案。同时，以“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言骗取了选票的美国新任总统艾森豪威尔，在他的就职演说中已经公然叫嚣：“我们必须准备为了我们的国家敢于做一切事情”，他还要美国人民“必须欣然接受要求我们所作的任何牺牲”。这就使人们更加清楚地看出：不论是杜鲁门政府还是艾森豪威尔政府，他们不但都毫无“结束朝鲜战争”的意思，而且相反的，他们都在极力破坏结束朝鲜战争的一切可能和希望。
    怀抱着这样恶毒的意图，美国侵略者是不惜“做一切事情”的。美国侵略者早已破坏了朝鲜停战谈判的中立区协议，不断派遣美军飞机侵越板门店会场区，并于本月十五日以片面通知的方式，公然撕毁关于代表团供应车辆不受攻击的协议，企图借此使停战谈判完全破裂，以便他们扩大侵朝战争。美方代表团前官方发言人纳科斯于本月十九日对记者的谈话中就曾表示：“朝鲜停战谈判绝对不会在原地恢复。”美国侵略者企图彻底破坏朝鲜停战谈判的野心已是无法掩饰的了。
    现在侵朝美军飞机又连续侵犯我国东北等地领空，并对我东北地区进行战略侦察，这就更加暴露了美国企图扩大战争的罪恶野心。这是美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭受到惨重的失败、在朝鲜停战谈判中企图迫使我方屈服的诡计也遭到了失败、连他们灭绝人性的细菌战也遭到了失败、一直到他们操纵联合国通过了强迫扣留战俘的非法决议案也无济于事的时候所采取的进一步的横暴挑衅行动。美国侵略者以为这样就可以迫使我们对它的暴力实行妥协，以便于它恢复它在资本主义世界、尤其是在它的亚洲的仆从国家中因侵朝战争的失败而日益低落的威望，并达到它进一步掠夺与镇压亚洲各国人民的目的。
    我国人民决不可忽视美国侵略者的这个罪恶阴谋，而必须充分认识美国向我国进行新的挑衅的严重意义。据国新社东京十五日的电讯透露，美国侵略军远东空军司令威兰在东京公开叫嚣，他“已准备轰炸中国大陆，如果艾森豪威尔下令这样做的话”。由此可见，美国侵朝空军最近连续轰炸我国东北和美国海军飞机和舰只窜扰我国南海的行动，正是这种侵略行为的先声。对于艾森豪威尔之流准备扩大侵略战争的种种秘密的部署和行动，美国的官员、国会议员和美国的反动报刊近来都毫不讳言地进行着狂妄的宣传。这是全世界爱好和平的善良人民与亚洲各国人民绝对不能熟视无睹的。
    久经战斗的我国人民是帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计和侵略行动所吓不倒的。美国侵略者企图扩大侵朝战争和进攻我国的阴谋，只会遭到我国人民和朝鲜人民更加坚决的打击。过去两年多以来，我国人民既然能一面进行抗美援朝的伟大斗争，一面加速完成工农业的恢复工作；那末，现在我国人民就更有信心能够一面进行经济建设，一面加紧抗美援朝的斗争。美国侵略者在过去两年多的侵朝战争中，以其三分之一的陆军、四分之一的空军和大部分的海军的力量，并纠集了十几个仆从国家的兵力，依然不免在战争中遭受惨重的失败，使美国及其附庸军队伤亡达七十三万六千多人，内中美军占三十二万多人。美国侵略者因此而困难重重，士气极度低落，士兵大批逃亡。各仆从国家也因此而更加裹足不前，不愿为美国侵略者继续火中取栗。在这种情况下，美国侵略者要实行扩大侵略战争的计划完全是自取失败的绝路。美国侵略者企图以李承晚伪军和国民党残匪军队作为他们挽回失败、扩大侵略战争的赌本，这就完全说明美帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋面临着何等重大的困难。
    我国人民当前的任务，就是在大力进行国家建设的同时，丝毫不放松地警惕敌人正在日夜加紧准备着的扩大战争和进攻我国的阴谋。我们必须更加紧张起来，继续加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争。如果敌人敢于冒险，我们就一定要使敌人遭到最严重的失败。
