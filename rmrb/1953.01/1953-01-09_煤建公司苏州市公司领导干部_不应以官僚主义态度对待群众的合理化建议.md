    Leading Cadres of the Suzhou Company of the Coal Construction Company
    Should Not Treat the Rationalization Proposals of the Masses with a Bureaucratic Attitude
    Comrade Editor: Leading cadres of the Suzhou Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company, in carrying out the labor emulation campaign, have treated the rationalization proposals of the masses with a bureaucratic attitude, causing the movement to stagnate. For example, Comrade Shi Ding'an of the company suggested that the gate of the bamboo fence warehouse be moved to the corner at the end of September last year to shorten the distance from the railway station to the warehouse. This would not only shorten the handling time but also save manpower and costs. However, when the proposal reached the competition office, the deputy director of the office endorsed it like an official document with "Hand it over to the Equipment Section for handling." After receiving it, the head of the Equipment Section stuffed it into a drawer. When someone asked him about it, he dug it out and wrote on it, "Can be tried, please Secretary Section to handle," but in the end it was still "filed away here" and not adopted. Another example is Comrade Cui Hengkang, who used his spare time and worked hard for twenty-six days to create an automatic coal sifting machine. The test results showed that it increased work efficiency by three times. However, when this proposal was sent to the office, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. In short, in the three months of September, October, and November last year, the comrades put forward no less than four hundred rationalization proposals, but except for some small issues of living welfare, none of the others were adopted, thus affecting the comrades' work enthusiasm. Some said: "The door of the competition office is set up but often closed." Some said: "Rationalization proposals are a waste of paper and brainpower." It is hoped that the leading cadres of the company will properly handle these rationalization proposals.  You Houcheng

    煤建公司苏州市公司领导干部
    不应以官僚主义态度对待群众的合理化建议
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司苏州市公司领导干部在开展劳动竞赛中，以官僚主义态度对待群众提出的合理化建议，致使运动停滞不前。如该公司施定安同志建议在去年九月底将竹篱笆仓库的栅门移到弯角处，以缩短火车站至仓库的距离，这样不但会缩短搬运的时间，且节省人力和费用。但建议到了竞赛办公室，办公室副主任就像公文一样批上“交器材科办”。器材科科长接到后，就向抽屉内一塞，等到人家问他，他才翻出来，并在上面写上“可以试用，请秘书科办理”，但最后还是“到此归档”，没有采纳。又崔恒康同志，利用业余时间，经过二十六天的苦心钻研，创造了一个自动筛煤机。试验结果，提高了工作效率三倍。但当这一建议送到办公室后，却如石沉大海。总之，在去年九、十、十一三个月中，同志们提出的合理化建议不下四百多件，结果除了一些生活福利的小问题外，其余都没有被采纳，因而影响了同志们的工作情绪，有的说：“竞赛办公室的门虽设而常关。”有的说：“合理化提了白费纸张，伤脑筋”。希望该公司领导干部正确处理这些合理化建议。  尤后承
