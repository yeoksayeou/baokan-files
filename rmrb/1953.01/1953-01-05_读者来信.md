    The Number and Chaos of Meetings in Shangrao City Factories

    Comrade Editor: In many factories and enterprises in Shangrao City, there is a lack of unified planning for employees' spare time activities, and meetings are numerous and chaotic. The content of meetings often overlaps, and the timing of meetings clashes. The reason for this is that they are not good at using scientific methods to work, but try to solve everything through meetings; however, they lack preparation for the meetings, and each one takes up most of the day. This seriously affects the rest, study, and production of employees.

    In addition, there is a great waste of time in the timing of mass rallies and general meetings in the city. Meetings usually cannot be held on time; sometimes, due to a lack of planning on the part of the leadership, meetings are announced, the crowds are assembled, and then the meeting time is changed. The masses are very dissatisfied with this situation.

    I believe that saving time is a very important issue. I hope that the Party, government, and trade union leaders of Shangrao City will attach importance to this issue ideologically, unify the regulations for various meeting activities, and strictly adhere to meeting times.

    Tangshan Municipal Party Committee Further Rationally Allocates Employees' Spare Time Activities

    Comrade Editor: Tangshan City made a decision as early as July 15, 1952, to rationally resolve the issue of spare time activities for employees in factories and mines, instructing all factories and mines in the city to implement it. However, according to our recent inspection, the city's decision has not been universally implemented, and the phenomenon of employees' excessive spare time activities and cadres holding too many concurrent positions still exists. This has seriously affected the health of employees and the maintenance of normal production order.

    After the city committee's decision was issued, various factories and mines formulated methods for rationally allocating employees' spare time activities, and some factories have achieved good results. For example, at the Tangshan Power Plant, 96% of employees spend an average of nine and a half hours per day at the factory. However, most of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the factories and mines did not go deep into the workshops to promptly check the root causes of improper allocation of spare time activities, specifically help workshop leaders understand and implement the spirit of the decision, and propose methods for improving work. Therefore, many workshop leaders in factories and mines have not correctly recognized the importance of rationally resolving the issue of employees' spare time activities, nor have they seriously corrected the phenomenon of excessive spare time activities for employees. After arranging the time for various meetings, some cadres feel that "the restrictions are too strict, and we cannot work without meetings." Therefore, they arbitrarily convene meetings without the approval of the Party committee. For example, the mechanical workshop of the railway factory felt that the time in the morning and evening was not enough, so they used the lunch break every day in the first week of November to hold meetings. Workers reflected: "We always have meetings at noon, our club and reading room are built for nothing." The situation in steel plants and Huaxin textile mills is also the same. In this way, workers regard meetings as a burden. Some people take leave of absence on the grounds of "having something to do" as soon as they hear about meetings, and some workers, although they participate in the meetings, become dizzy and cannot accept the content of the meetings, reducing the effectiveness of the meetings.

    Another situation is that the leadership's work arrangements are not unified, and the phenomenon of frequent contradictions still exists. For example, the steel plant's trade union arranged to discuss the 1953 plan, and the Party Committee's Organization Department notified them to attend Party classes; the administrative department of the railway factory's tool workshop discussed the red flag reward method on November 8th, and the Safety Committee arranged for safety and hygiene inspections.

    In addition, the phenomenon of cadres in various factories and mines, especially labor models and activists, holding many concurrent positions is still very serious. They generally hold three or four concurrent positions, and some hold as many as eight or nine positions, and they are busy every day, which has a great impact on their health and production. Zhao Xu, Chen Fugui and others from the model group of the steel plant's casting department spent nearly half a month in October attending meetings and visiting, which affected the group's production performance, and the workers were dissatisfied.

    In order to rationally allocate employees' spare time activities, we have decided to take the following measures: First, the spare time activities of employees in each factory and mine should not exceed ten hours per week. Second, each unit should uniformly and rationally allocate spare time activities, establish strict systems, under the unified control of the Party committee, and pay attention to reducing unnecessary meetings. Various meetings should be as brief and concise as possible and solve problems. This system should be conscientiously implemented under the supervision of all employees, and employees have the right to protest against those who violate the regulations. Third, starting from the large-scale cultivation and promotion of cadres, solve the problem of cadres holding many concurrent positions. Generally, employees should not hold more than two concurrent positions, and the concurrent positions of labor models should be especially controlled. Fourth, visits to labor models must be approved by the factory Party committee to reduce excessive visits. General visits can be assigned to agents to talk, to ensure that labor models put their main energy into production.

    Streamlining Unnecessary Organizational Structures is an Important Method to Solve the Problem of Employees Holding Many Concurrent Positions

    Comrade Editor: The problems of long spare time activities for employees, many meetings, and cadres holding many concurrent positions at the Shijingshan Power Plant were basically resolved in October 1952. In the process of solving this problem, we realized that in order to make the effect of this work permanently consolidated, in addition to taking measures such as controlling meetings, stipulating meeting times, and reducing the number of concurrent positions held by cadres, we must further study and solve the following practical problems:

    Streamline unnecessary organizational structures. The trade union organization in our factory has 13 committees, and according to the current situation of our factory, some of these organizational structures can indeed be merged, and some can be cancelled. For example, the work of the Living and Housing Committee is only to hold meetings to study the allocation of houses after new houses are built; and this is a work related to the welfare of workers, so it can be incorporated into the Labor Protection Committee. The central tasks of the Production Committee and the Rationalization Proposal Committee are all to do a good job in the production competition movement, so these two organizations can also be merged into one committee. The Club Committee can now be cancelled, because at present our factory does not have a large-scale club like the Soviet factories, so it is completely possible to do a good job under the leadership of the Culture and Education Committee. The personnel of each organizational structure have also been appropriately streamlined. In the past, in our factory, only the cadres in various work committees in the trade union system numbered 143. The committee with the most cadres had 19 people, and the committee with the fewest had 9 people. Now each committee has been reduced to five to seven people. For example, the Rationalization Proposal Committee used to have 19 members; now, after merging with the Production Committee, it has only five members, and it can do a good job. In this way, the trade union system has reduced cadres by 66.3%. Streamlining organizational structures and reducing the number of cadres not only adapts to the current conditions of insufficient cadres, but also fundamentally streamlines meetings and solves the problem of cadres holding many concurrent positions and too many meetings.

    Closely following the streamlining of organizational structures, reducing meetings, and shortening meeting times, it is necessary to immediately strengthen the education of cadres. In our factory, the first step is to reduce unnecessary meeting levels and strengthen workshop activities to cultivate and improve cadres through practical work. Any detailed work in production management, such as division of labor and specialization, cannot be solved by holding mass rallies and putting forward slogans, and can be directly relied on by the workshop. For example, planning, inspection of plans, and production meetings can generally be resolved by workshop meetings. In this way, on the one hand, the working ability of workshop cadres is trained and their initiative is brought into play; on the other hand, the level of meetings is reduced. Therefore, the grassroots work of each system must be strengthened. In each group, there should generally be an administrative group leader, a trade union group leader or a Communist Youth League group leader to establish a leadership core and exert a leadership role.

    上饶市各工厂会议既多又乱
    编辑同志：在上饶市许多工厂、企业中，职工业余活动时间缺乏统一安排，会议又多又乱，经常发生会议内容重复和会议时间抵触的现象。所以发生这种现象，是因为他们不善于用科学的方法进行工作，而是事事都要通过开会来解决；但开会又缺乏准备，一开就费去大半天的时间。这就严重地影响了职工的休息、学习和生产。
    另外，在该市召开群众大会和一般会议的时间上也有着很大的浪费。会议通常都不能按时举行；有时由于领导上缺乏计划，刚通知开会，群众队伍也集合好了，又要更改会议时间。群众对这种情况很不满意。
    我认为，节约时间是一个非常重要的问题，希望上饶市党、政、工会领导方面从思想上重视这个问题，统一规定各种会议活动，并严格遵守开会时间。

    中共唐山市委进一步合理支配职工业余活动时间
    编辑同志：唐山市早在一九五二年七月十五日就作出合理解决各厂矿职工业余活动时间的决定，指示全市各厂矿贯彻执行；但据我们最近检查，市委的决定并没有普遍贯彻，各厂矿职工业余活动时间过长，干部兼职过多的现象仍然存在。这就使职工身体健康和正常生产秩序的维持受到严重的影响。
    在市委决定发出以后，各厂矿都规定了合理支配职工业余活动时间的办法，个别厂并收到了良好效果，如：唐山发电厂有百分之九十六的职工平均每日在厂时间为九小时半。但多数厂矿党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部都没有深入车间及时检查业余活动时间支配不当的根源，具体帮助车间领导干部领会并贯彻决定的精神，提出改进工作的办法。因此，很多厂矿的车间领导干部没有正确认识到合理解决职工业余活动时间问题的重要意义，也没有认真纠正职工业余活动时间过长的现象。在安排各种会议时间后，有些干部觉得“限制的严，不开会就无法工作。”于是，不经党委批准就任意召开会议。如：铁路工厂机械车间嫌早晚时间不够用，在十一月份第一周就利用每天中午休息时间开会。工人们反映：“中午总开会，咱们的俱乐部、阅报室白盖了”。钢厂、华新纱厂等情况也是这样。这样，工人们就把开会当做负担，有的人一听说开会就以“有事”请假，有些工人虽然参加了会，也弄得头昏脑胀，接受不了会议的内容，减弱了会议的作用。
    另一个情况是，领导方面布置工作不统一，经常发生矛盾的现象依然存在。如：钢厂工会布置讨论一九五三年计划，党委组织部又通知上党课；铁路工厂工具车间行政在十一月八日讨论红旗奖励办法，安全委员会又布置进行安全卫生检查。
    此外，各厂矿车间干部特别是劳动模范、积极分子兼职多的现象仍然十分严重。他们一般都兼三、四职，多的则兼八、九职，每天忙忙碌碌，对身体健康及生产等都有很大影响。钢厂铸造部模范小组赵旭、陈富贵等人，在十月份有近半月的时间因为开会、访问，以致影响了小组生产成绩，工人们都不满意。
    为了合理支配职工业余活动时间，我们决定采取如下措施：一，各厂矿职工业余活动时间每周不能超过十小时。二，各单位应统一合理地分配业余活动时间，建立严格制度，由党委统一掌握，并注意减少不必要的会议，各种会议应力求简短、紧凑，能解决问题。这一制度，应在全体职工监督下认真贯彻，职工对违犯规定者，有权提出抗议。三，从大量培养、提拔干部着手，解决干部兼职多的问题，一般职工兼职最多不超过两职，对劳动模范的兼职问题更应特别控制。四，访问劳动模范必须经工厂党委同意以减少过多的访问。一般访问可指定代理人接谈，以保证劳动模范把主要精力用在生产上。

    精简不必要的组织机构是解决职工兼职多的重要方法
    编辑同志：石景山发电厂的职工业余活动时间长、会议多和干部兼职多的问题，已于一九五二年十月间基本上解决了。在解决这个问题的过程中，我们体会到要使这一工作效果永久巩固下去，除了采取控制会议、规定会议时间和减少干部的兼职等方法以外，必须进一步研究解决以下几个实际问题：
    精简不必要的组织机构。我们厂的工会组织就有十三个委员会，而这些组织机构，根据我厂当前的实际情况，确是有的可以合并，有的可以取消。如生活居住委员会的工作，只是在盖成了新房子后，开会研究分配房子；而这是一项关系工人福利的工作，因此，它可以并入劳动保护委员会。生产委员会和合理化建议委员会的中心工作，都是为了搞好生产竞赛运动，因此，这两个机构也可以合并为一个委员会。俱乐部委员会现在可以取消，因为目前我们厂里还没有像苏联的工厂那样大规模的俱乐部，所以在文教委员会的领导下是完全可以作好工作的。对各组织机构的人员，也进行了适当的精简。过去我厂仅在工会系统中各种工作委员会里的干部，就有一百四十三人。一个委员会的干部最多的达十九人，最少的也要九人。现在各委员会都减为五人到七人。如合理化建议委员会过去有十九个委员；现在与生产委员会合并后，只有五个委员，而且可以作好工作。这样，工会系统中就减少了干部百分之六十六点三。组织机构精简了，干部减少了，这不但适应于目前干部不足的条件，而且从根本上精简了会议，解决干部兼职多和会议多的问题。
    紧跟着精简了组织机构、减少会议和缩短了会议时间以后，必须立刻加强对干部的教育。在我们工厂里，首先是减少不必要的会议层次，加强车间活动，通过实际工作来培养和提高干部。凡是布置生产管理上的细致的工作如劳动分工、专业化等，不是开大会动员、提出口号所能解决的问题，可以直接依靠车间来进行。如订计划、检查计划和生产会议，一般也可以由车间会议来解决。这样，一方面锻炼了车间干部的工作能力，发挥其工作的主动性；另一方面减少了会议的层次。因此，各个系统的基层工作都必须加强，在每一小组内，一般均应有一个行政小组长、工会小组长或青年团的小组长，以建立领导核心，发挥领导作用。
