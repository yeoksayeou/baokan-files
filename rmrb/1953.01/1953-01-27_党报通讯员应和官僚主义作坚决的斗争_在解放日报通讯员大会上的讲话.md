Editor's Note: The Shanghai Liberation Daily held a conference of more than 1,800 correspondents from all over Shanghai on January 18th, calling on correspondents to actively respond to the Party's call, carry out criticism and self-criticism more vigorously in the newspapers, especially bottom-up criticism, and fully expose and correct the current suppression of criticism, bureaucracy, coercion, and illegal and undisciplined behavior of certain cadres in Party organizations, People's Governments, people's organizations, and enterprises. At the meeting, Comrade Hu Lijiao, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau, and Comrade Pan Hannian, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC and Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, both expressed their full support for the struggle of correspondents in response to the Party's call. Below is the speech given by Comrade Hu Lijiao at the conference, originally published in the Shanghai Liberation Daily on January 22nd.

Comrades of the Party Newspaper Correspondents:

After the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers have become more widespread and more valued than before. Our newspapers exposed many bad people and bad deeds during the "Three-Anti" movement, and gave them serious criticism and treatment. However, even so, some bureaucrats within the Party and government still exhibit serious phenomena of suppressing criticism and retaliating against critics. This anti-Party wrongdoing must be taken seriously by the entire Party. Because, first of all, our Party has seized national power, and every move affects the interests of the broad masses of people throughout the country. Any mistake or shortcoming in our work will have great harm. Secondly, because our Party is in a leading position, and because the Party's prestige among the broad masses of people has been unprecedentedly enhanced, it is easy for some leading cadres to develop complacency and unwillingness to listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses. Therefore, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, maintaining and promoting democratic life inside and outside the Party, supporting mass-based bottom-up criticism, and closely linking the Party with the people, so that all Party members and cadres can better serve the country and the people under the constant supervision of the broad masses, has become a serious political task for the entire Party at present, and the widespread promotion of criticism and self-criticism in newspapers has become even more important.

Comrade Malenkov, in his report to the 19th Congress of the CPSU, particularly emphasized the development of bottom-up criticism. Comrade Malenkov emphasized that this is "the main method for exposing and overcoming our mistakes and shortcomings, our weaknesses and faults..." We can understand that without developing bottom-up criticism, our cause and the interests of the people will be ruined by bureaucrats!

Recently, we have found that many Party organizations and government agencies, including some responsible cadres, are adopting an incorrect attitude towards carrying out criticism and self-criticism. When they are criticized, they resort to vile means of suppressing, attacking, and retaliating against the critics. For example, the Huang Yifeng incident in the East China-level organs is one example. This incident also shows that carrying out criticism and self-criticism is not a simple matter, but must go through serious struggles.

What methods do these anti-Party old masters, these bureaucrats who suppress criticism, take to deal with critics? They are nothing more than the following:

First, labeling the critics with big hats. For example, Huang Yifeng said that Xue Chengfeng was a "saboteur." Another example is that a comrade in the Ministry of Justice wrote to the Party newspaper criticizing Comrade Li Shi for not attending Party meetings. Comrade Li Shi not only did not accept the criticism, but instead labeled the Party member who wrote the article as "undisciplined and unorganized."

Obviously, this behavior violates the Party Constitution. Because the Party Constitution stipulates:

"The Communist Party of China should not conceal the errors and shortcomings in its work. The Communist Party of China should use the method of criticism and self-criticism to regularly review the errors and shortcomings in its work to educate its members and cadres, and to correct its errors in a timely manner. The Communist Party of China opposes arrogance and complacency, fear of admitting its mistakes, and fear of criticism and self-criticism." Article 3 of the Party Constitution stipulates that the first right of a member is: "To participate freely and effectively in discussions on the implementation of Party policies at Party meetings or in Party publications." The same article also stipulates that members have the right to criticize any staff member at Party meetings. If the Party does not sanction these bureaucratic elements who violate the Party Constitution and Party discipline, the Party will become confused about right and wrong, become divorced from the masses, and the cause of the Party and the people will suffer significant losses.

Because some critics understand some principles and will not be easily subdued by the "big hats" of bureaucrats. Thus, bureaucrats change their tune and say: "You are also one of the cadres (or 'you are also one of the Party members'). If the work is done wrong, you are also responsible!" They try to intimidate the critics in order to suppress criticism. Or they say:

"Why didn't you offer your opinion face-to-face, but wrote about it behind our backs? You don't seem like a revolutionary comrade!" In fact, these bureaucrats do not accept verbal criticism or opinions offered face-to-face. For these people, the only effective way is to publish the criticism in the newspaper. For example, some localist bureaucrats who were recently criticized for refusing to transfer cadres to participate in basic construction had been previously criticized by their superiors, but they simply did not listen. However, once it was published in the newspaper, they changed their attitude.

Second, feigning to cover up mistakes and glossing over the essence of mistakes. For example, some bureaucrats say: "This is an internal matter of the agency and can be resolved internally, why publish it in the newspaper?" Or they say: "This matter should be kept secret for the time being and cannot be publicly criticized." Some play a trick, saying: "You can write the稿子, but let me see it, I can help you revise and supplement it." Still others who are criticized say to the critics: "Our work achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings are secondary. Your criticism is one-sided and won't work." No matter how cleverly these words are spoken, their purpose and essence is only one: to cover up mistakes. However, covering up mistakes cannot be allowed. Because if we cannot expose and correct shortcomings and mistakes, the cause of the Party and the people will be harmed. Therefore, specialized supervision agencies have been established in our Party organizations and government agencies to regularly assign personnel to conduct inspection work, and especially emphasize mobilizing mass inspections, so that the top and bottom can be combined to discover shortcomings and errors and overcome them. Some of our personnel engaged in inspection work adopt an uncompromisingly serious attitude towards shortcomings and errors, and sometimes even argue with some responsible cadres until their faces turn red. We believe that this is a good phenomenon, because it is most likely to prevent the occurrence of errors and shortcomings. However, some people have such a argument that "You are just nitpicking, not looking at the achievements." Just like the aforementioned argument of emphasizing achievements and covering up shortcomings to suppress critics. For this kind of person, we want to tell them: "Judging from the facts today, there are too few people who are nitpicking at you, and too many people who are talking about achievements."

Of course, "nitpicking" is not fabricating something out of nothing, but seeking truth from facts. Since what is found is fact, then the person who is "nitpicking" is not wrong.

Third, in order to facilitate the suppression of criticism, some bureaucrats say: We now need to establish a "system" called a "review system," and all稿子 written for newspapers must be reviewed. In fact, their intention is not about the system itself, but about covering up errors and shortcomings, and about suppressing criticism. We must declare: This "system" is illegal, and anyone has the right to revoke it.

Fourth, some units or comrades, after being criticized by the Party newspaper, dare not resist on the surface and express acceptance; but behind their backs, they say to the people who write the criticism稿子 in a cold and sarcastic tone: "Our activists are really popular, they really have a bright future!" Or, they accept criticism on the surface, but secretly seize on some shortcomings of the critics, even small details in their lives, and make a big deal out of them. This is called retaliation.

The above four manifestations of suppressing criticism are concretely and centrally expressed in Huang Yifeng.

But problems like Huang Yifeng are not isolated among our agency staff. Bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and regulations can be found in many places. This is a reflection of the remnants of the Kuomintang style in our Party and government. We must resolutely fight against this anti-Party wrongdoing! Our Party newspapers also bear a great responsibility, and all of our Party newspaper correspondents also bear a significant responsibility. Comrade correspondents must strengthen their determination and confidence and shoulder this important task. The Huang Yifeng incident tells us that without a high degree of Party principles and without the determination and confidence to fight tenaciously to uphold the Party's principles, it is impossible to defeat the sophistry of bureaucrats.

So, how should our Party newspaper correspondents carry out criticism?

First, we must resolutely and tenaciously safeguard the interests of the Party, the country, and all the people. We must boldly and unreservedly undertake the political tasks of correspondents. Only in this way can we wage an irreconcilable struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of laws and regulations.

This is a question of the interests of the Party, the country, and the people, not a question of personal gain or loss. Even if individuals are subjected to attacks and retaliation in this struggle, do not be afraid, do not have concerns.

Second, every Party newspaper correspondent must fight to the end to uphold the truth. It must be recognized that in your future work, it is very likely that you will be obstructed by bad elements, and it is also very likely that the truth will be obscured, thus temporarily isolating you, but this isolation is glorious, and will eventually be supported by the entire Party and the people of the whole country. There have been people in history who have been wronged temporarily, but they will never be wronged for long. The truth cannot be buried.

Every Party newspaper correspondent must not only stand on the side of the Party and the people to expose bureaucracy, coercion, and all violations of laws and regulations, but also has the responsibility to educate the people around them, cultivate assistants, and expand our ears and eyes so that all bad people and bad deeds have nowhere to hide. We must always remember Comrade Stalin's instructions: "...we should persistently arouse millions of workers and peasants to carry out criticism from below and supervision from below as a disinfectant against bureaucracy."

Comrades: The struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against law-breaking and discipline-violating elements is a major task of our entire Party for a certain period of time. It is also the task of the Party newspapers, and the task of the Party newspaper correspondents. Let us work together to complete this glorious and great task entrusted to us by the Party!

### 党报通讯员应和官僚主义作坚决的斗争——在解放日报通讯员大会上的讲话

    党报通讯员应和官僚主义作坚决的斗争
    ——在解放日报通讯员大会上的讲话
    胡立教
    编者按：上海解放日报社在一月十八日召开了全上海市一千八百多人的通讯员大会，号召通讯员积极响应党的号召，在报纸上更有力地开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，充分揭发与纠正目前党组织、人民政府，人民团体和企业中的某些干部的压制批评、官僚主义、强迫命令、违法乱纪等恶劣行为。在会上，中共中央华东局组织部副部长胡立教同志和中共上海市委员会副书记、上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年同志，都表示全力支持通讯员为响应党的这一号召而进行的斗争。下面是胡立教同志在大会上的发言，原载一月二十二日上海解放日报。党报通讯员同志们：
    伟大的“三反”“五反”运动以后，在报纸上的批评与自我批评，是比以前更开展了，更被重视了。我们的报纸在“三反”运动中，曾揭露了许多坏人、坏事，并予以严肃的批判与处理。但是，虽然如此，党和政府内部的某些官僚主义者仍然存在着压制批评，对批评者施行打击、报复的严重现象。这种反党恶行，必须引起全党的重视。因为，首先，我们的党已取得了全国的政权，一举一动都会影响到全国广大人民的利益，任何一件工作犯了错误发生了缺点，其危害性都是很大的。其次，由于我们的党是处于领导地位，并由于党在广大人民中的威信空前提高，就容易在某些领导干部中产生骄傲自满情绪，不愿听取群众的意见和批评。因此，开展批评与自我批评，维护和发扬党内外的民主生活，支持群众性的自下而上的批评，密切党与人民群众的联系，使全体党员与干部，经常在广大群众的监督之下，更好地为国家与人民服务，就成为全党当前的严重的政治任务，而在报纸上广泛开展批评与自我批评，也就具有更加重要的意义。
    马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告中，特别强调开展自下而上的批评。马林科夫同志强调指出：这是“作为揭露并克服我们的错误与缺点、我们的弱点和毛病的主要方法，……”我们可以理解：不开展自下而上的批评，我们的事业，人民的利益，就会被官僚主义者所葬送！
    最近，我们发现许多党的组织和政府机关中，包括某些负责干部在内，对待开展批评与自我批评是采取一种不正确的态度的。当他们受到批评时，采取了压制、打击和报复批评者的恶劣手段。如在华东一级机关中发生的黄逸峰事件，就是一个例子。这一事件也说明了：开展批评与自我批评不是一件简单的事情，而必须经过严重的斗争。
    官僚主义者，压制批评的这些反党的老爷们采取些什么办法来对待批评者呢？不外乎下列几种：
    一、给批评者扣大帽子。如：黄逸峰说薛承凤是“破坏分子”。又如司法部有一位同志向党报写稿批评李式一同志不参加党的会议，李式一同志不但没有接受批评，反而给那位写稿的党员，扣上“无组织无纪律”的帽子。
    显然这种行为是违反党章的。因为党章中规定：
    “中国共产党应该不掩盖自己工作中的错误与缺点。中国共产党应该用批评和自我批评的方法，经常检讨自己工作中的错误与缺点，来教育自己的党员和干部，并及时纠正自己的错误。中国共产党反对那种自高自大、害怕承认自己错误、害怕批评与自我批评的情绪。”党章的第三条规定党员的第一项权利就是：“在党的会议或党的刊物上，参加关于党的政策的实施问题之自由的切实的讨论。”同条又规定党员有权在党的会议上批评任何工作人员。党对这些违反党章、党纪的官僚主义分子，如不加以制裁，党就会是非不明，脱离群众，就会使党与人民的事业受到重大的损失。
    由于有些批评者懂得一些道理，不会轻易为官僚主义者的“大帽子”压服。于是，官僚主义者就改口说：“你也是干部之一（或者说‘你也是党员之一’），工作做错了，你也有责任呀！”企图以此来恐吓批评者，达到压制批评的目的。或者说：
    “你为什么当面不提意见，背后乱写？真不像一个革命同志的样子！”事实上这些官僚主义者对口头的批评、当面提意见，是不接受的。对于这些人，唯一有效的办法就是登报批评。如最近有一些因拒绝抽调干部参加基本建设而被批评的本位主义者，事先都曾被上级指责过，但他们就是不听。可是，一登报，他们就改变了态度。
    二、装腔作势地掩盖错误，粉饰错误的本质。例如，有的官僚主义者说：“这是机关内部事情，可在内部解决，何必登报呢？”或者说：“这事情暂时应保守秘密，不能公开批评。”有的则玩一个圈套，说是：“稿子可以写，但要给我看看，我可帮你修改、补充。”也还有些被批评的人对批评者说：“咱们工作的成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的。你的批评带有片面性，不行。”不管这些话说得多么巧妙，他们的目的，实质只有一个：掩饰错误。但是，掩饰错误是不能容许的。因为如果不能揭发和纠正缺点与错误，那么党与人民的事业就会受到损害。所以，在我们党的组织与政府机关中，设立了专门的监察机构，经常指派人员去进行检查工作，并且特别强调发动群众性的检查，使上下结合起来，以便发现缺点和错误，并加以克服。我们有些搞检查工作的人员对待缺点与错误采取毫不放松的严肃态度，有时候，甚至和某些负责干部争得面红耳赤，我们认为这是好现象，因为，这是最能制止错误和缺点的发生的。但是，有的人却有这样一种论调，说“你专找岔子，不看成绩。”正如上述的强调成绩、掩饰缺点的那种压制批评者的论调一样。对于这种人，我们要告诉他们：“从今天的事实看，对于你们是找岔子的人太少，而谈成绩的人太多了”。
    当然，“找岔子”并不是无中生有，而是实事求是。既然找到的是事实，那么“找岔子”的人就没错。
    三、为了便于压制批评，有些官僚主义者说：我们现在要建立一种“制度”，这个“制度”叫做
    “审稿制度”，对所有写给报纸的稿件，都要进行审查。实际上，他们的用意不在于制度问题，而在于掩饰错误和缺点，在于压制批评。我们必须宣布：这种“制度”是非法的，任何人都有权撤销它。
    四、有的单位或有的同志，在受到党报批评后，表面上不敢抗拒，表示接受；但背后却冷言冷语地对写批评稿的人说：“我们的积极分子真吃得开呀，真有前途呀！”或者，他们表面上接受批评，暗地里抓住批评者的一些缺点，甚至是生活小节上的缺点大做文章。这文章叫做报复。
    以上这四种压制批评的表现形式，具体地、集中地表现在黄逸峰身上。
    但类似黄逸峰这样的问题在我们的机关工作人员中并不是个别的。官僚主义、命令主义以及违法乱纪的现象在很多地方都可以找到，这是国民党作风的残余在我们党和政府中的反映，我们必须坚决地与这种反党的恶行进行斗争！我们党报也负有很大责任，我们全体党报通讯员也负有重大的责任。通讯员同志们必须坚定自己的决心和信心，担负起这个重大的任务。黄逸峰的事件就告诉我们：没有党的高度原则性和没有为坚持党的原则而顽强地进行斗争的决心和信心，是不能战胜官僚主义者的狡辩的。
    那么，我们党报通讯员同志们要怎样来展开批评呢？
    第一，我们要坚决地、顽强地维护党与国家和全体人民的利益，我们要大胆无虑地担负起通讯员的政治任务。只有这样，才能够对官僚主义、强迫命令和违法乱纪的现象作不调和的斗争。
    这是一个关系着党、国家和人民的利益的问题，而不是个人得失的问题。在这一斗争中，即使个人会受到打击、报复，也不要害怕，不要顾虑。
    第二，每一个党报通讯员都要为坚持真理而奋斗到底。必须认识到，在你们今后的工作中，很可能受到坏分子的阻挠，也很可能使事实真相被蒙蔽因而使你暂时陷于孤立，但这种孤立是光荣的，最后必将得到全党和全国人民的支持。一时受委屈的人，在历史上是有的，但决不会长期受委屈，真理是不可能被埋没的。
    每一个党报通讯员不仅要自己站在党和人民的立场上，揭露官僚主义、强迫命令和一切违法乱纪的现象，而且有责任教育周围群众，培养助手，扩大我们的耳目，使一切坏人坏事无处藏身。我们要时刻记住斯大林同志的指示：“……我们应顽强地唤起千百万工人和农民群众来进行从下而上的批评，从下而上的监督，以作为对官僚主义的消毒剂”。
    同志们：反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪分子的斗争，是在一定时期内我们全党的重大任务，也是党报的任务、党报通讯员的任务，让我们在共同努力之下，完成党所交给我们的这个光荣、伟大的任务！
