    Reader Letters
    Congratulating the Soviet Union on the Victory of Security Work, Raising Vigilance, and Defending National Construction
    --A Summary of Reader Letters
    The recent news of the Soviet Union's cracking down on a sabotage gang of spies has caused a great reaction among the broad masses of readers. Many readers wrote to this newspaper, expressing their great anger at the imperialists' plot to assassinate Soviet leaders by using spies and secret agents disguised as professors and doctors, and their excitement at the Soviet Union's major victory in its national security work. Readers also unanimously expressed in their letters that they must learn from this lesson, raise their vigilance, and strengthen the protection of the safety of our people and the great construction work of our motherland.
    Wang Qi and Pang Shuge from the Beijing Public Security Bureau wrote: The fact that the Soviet Union cracked down on a spy and sabotage gang "has great educational significance for us... In order to welcome the large-scale economic construction that is about to come, everyone should raise their vigilance and eliminate carelessness and complacency. The enemy will not give up their sabotage plots because our strength is growing." Another public security officer, Comrade Ma Fu, wrote that the fact that the Soviet Union cracked down on a sabotage gang of spies "makes me realize once again the importance of the public security work in the construction of the motherland... We know that the greater our victory, the more despicable and vicious the enemy's sabotage activities will be, and the more concealed their sabotage schemes will be." He also said, "With the start of large-scale national construction, public security work is even more important. We must use increased vigilance to protect our production and construction." Shou Henian from Beijing Machine Manufacturing Industrial School wrote: "As long as the imperialist aggressive forces have not been eliminated, we should never neglect the struggle against imperialist spies and all counter-revolutionary elements." "Everyone has a responsibility to protect the safety of the motherland, the leaders, and the people, and must never allow spies, secret agents, and counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage."
    Some readers also put forward specific suggestions. For example, Chen Buxiang, a post office worker, wrote, "Every one of us must raise our vigilance at all times. Whether at work or in life, we must be careful and cautious, and must not be negligent in the slightest, so as to give the enemy a chance to exploit." He cited an example that many people often lose very important things in the post office, such as work permits, entry and exit permits, letters of introduction, household registration forms, badges, armbands, diaries, etc. Some diaries also contain very important addresses and phone numbers. "If these things fall into the hands of bad people, they may be used to do bad things and cause losses to the country and the people." Therefore, Chen Buxiang said, "We must overcome the wrong idea of 'revolutionary victory, carefree life' and always be vigilant against the enemy in order to protect the safety of the motherland and the beautiful life of the people."
    Two Demands of Herdsmen in the Ikzhao League Area
    Editor's Note: The following is a letter from Ulanda Lai and Mishigeer, herdsmen in the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region of Suiyuan Province. They raised two issues: changing black goats to white goats and providing herdsmen with tools to catch and shear wool. According to the investigation by our newspaper reporter, they are indeed common demands of local Mongolian and Han herdsmen in animal husbandry production. Our reporter immediately contacted the People's Government of the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region, and they believed that these two demands were reasonable and should be taken seriously, and proposed preliminary solutions. Regarding the issue of changing black goats to white goats, the People's Government of the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region has decided to first vigorously use the white male goats in the league to breed with black female goats, and contact other regions to purchase white male goats; of course, this issue will take a long time to be completely resolved. Regarding the herdsmen's request to provide tools for self-catching and shearing cashmere wool, the People's Government of the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region has studied with the local Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office and decided that the cooperative will do a good job in surveying and counting the tool needs and preparing for purchase and transportation (with loans from the People's Bank), and the grabs and scissors can be lent out before the spring wool is caught and sheared this spring; in about three years, herdsmen in the entire league will be able to catch and shear cashmere wool themselves.
    We rarely receive letters from ethnic minority areas, especially letters from ethnic minorities in remote areas. In order to strengthen the connection between our newspaper and various ethnic minorities, we hope to receive letters that reflect the lives, production, and various demands of the people in ethnic minority areas.
    Raising Black Goats is Too Uneconomical
    Comrade Editor: Most of the goats currently owned by Mongolian and Han herdsmen in the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region are black. For example, in the Junwang Banner, among the existing 210,000 goats, there are less than 400 white goats. Whether it is black goats or white goats, the cost and labor we spend on grazing are the same, but because the cashmere and wool of black goats cannot be dyed other colors, the industrial use is small, and the price is low. The income from raising black goats is almost half less than that from raising white goats. For example, last year, black cashmere was 35,000 yuan per catty, and wool was 6,700 yuan, while white cashmere was 55,000 yuan per catty, and wool was 11,200 yuan. There is also a large difference in the price of black goat skins and white goat skins. Therefore, we feel that raising black goats is too uneconomical and want to change all black goats into white goats. But because we have too few white goats now, it is not easy to buy good breeding goats, so it is very difficult to change. It is said that there are many white goats in the Ulanqab League not far from us and other leagues in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which are farther away. Our neighboring province, Ningxia, also has a white sheep with long hair and more meat. As long as the People's Government and the trade and cooperative departments pay attention to helping us, this problem is not difficult to solve. In order to enable our animal husbandry to better serve the industry, and also in order for our herdsmen to increase their income, I suggest that the People's Government of the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region and the People's Government of Suiyuan Province find ways to help us gradually realize this wish.
                        Mongolian Herdsman Ulanda Lai
    Herdsmen Need Tools to Catch and Shear Cashmere Wool
    Comrade Editor: We are herdsmen in the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region of Suiyuan Province, and we request the People's Government to assist us in solving the problem of tools needed to catch and shear cashmere wool ourselves.
    Before liberation, we always contracted the catching and shearing of cashmere wool to border merchants. Border merchants often kept the price of cashmere wool very low; and they did not cherish our sheep very much, and every year they would catch and shear many sheep to death. Herdsmen suffered considerable losses.
    After liberation, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives took over most of the work of catching and shearing cashmere wool, which reduced a lot of our losses. For example, in the spring of the year before last, many private merchants only gave 6,000 yuan for catching and shearing the cashmere wool of one sheep, while the cooperative gave 8,000 yuan. Our herdsmen at that time were very supportive of this correct approach by the People's Government.
    However, with the development of animal husbandry production, we gradually feel that this approach can no longer meet our requirements. Because the number of workers in cooperatives and trading companies who catch and shear cashmere wool is limited, and the pastoral area is vast and the herdsmen live scattered, their catching and shearing work has to start early and end late. In this way, many sheep are caught too early, and the cashmere is still very firm on the sheepskin, and it is not easy to catch it all down; if it is forced to be caught and sheared down completely, the sheep will not be able to withstand the cold wind and die. Some sheep are caught too late, and part of the cashmere will fall off on its own. For example, in Hangjin Banner, it was not finished catching and shearing until June last year, and more than 100,000 sheep lost more than 10 million yuan of cashmere wool. Sheep that are caught late are prone to illness and death because of the hot weather, a lot of cashmere wool, and long hair; and because herdsmen do not have money to buy single clothes before the cashmere wool is sold, some people still wear old sheepskins in the hot weather. Everyone reflects that both people and sheep cannot change the season. In addition, some workers who catch and shear cashmere wool catch and shear very roughly in order to save time; some lose a lot of cashmere wool, and some use too much force to injure or kill the sheep. For example, the four sheep of Sagerlu, a herdsman in an administrative village in the fifth district of Junwang Banner, were caught by the cooperative, and she caught half a catty of cashmere wool (one sheep can only produce six ounces of cashmere wool in total). In the entire Junwang Banner, 98 sheep were injured and killed last year.
    Even so, herdsmen have to pay nearly 900 yuan in wages for catching and shearing each sheep. Therefore, herdsmen generally feel that if they catch and shear themselves, and the cooperatives and trading companies do a good job in purchasing, then not only can the above shortcomings be avoided, which is conducive to the development of animal husbandry; but also our herdsmen can relatively increase a lot of income.
    According to our understanding, many of our herdsmen can catch and shear cashmere wool; those who cannot can help each other with those who can, and they will quickly master this skill. Therefore, the only problem for our herdsmen to catch and shear cashmere wool themselves is the lack of tools - two grabs and one pair of scissors. But we think this is easy to solve. The three tools are only worth about 30,000 yuan in total. They can be made locally. There are many old ones in the cooperatives, and our herdsmen do not need to have a set of tools for every family. Therefore, we jointly suggest that the People's Government of the Ikzhao League Autonomous Region, cooperatives, and trading companies can help us solve this problem, so that animal husbandry can be further developed, and the lives of our herdsmen can be improved.

    The Happiness of Model Military Dependent Liu Zhongkun
    Comrade Editor: My name is Liu Zhongkun, from Gaoting Township, Third District, Yongxing County, Hunan Province. Since the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, after my third son Liu Sanfu joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, I became a glorious military dependent. During the land reform, my family was allocated 24 dan of paddy fields. The villagers wanted to farm it for me, but I thought that although I was over fifty years old, I could still work, so I resolutely refused to have it farmed for me. Last year, when we launched the patriotic bumper harvest movement, everyone said that I was old and experienced, so they elected me as the water conservancy committee member. I managed a total of four ridges of water, which was related to 600 dan of paddy fields. At the beginning, I paid attention to storing field water, checking leaks, and patching gaps. Every day I went out early and returned late, trying not to waste a drop of water. Last June, although there were some days of drought, not a single rice plant died. As a result, we had a bumper harvest. My mutual aid group increased production by 30% compared to the original plan. My family's life is very good, and the People's Government insisted on giving me 100 jin of preferential grain for military dependents. I don't know how to thank Chairman Mao. Sanfu is now on the front line in Korea, and he often writes letters saying: "The life in the army is good, and I am also learning culture. The comrades are as dear as brothers. Don't worry, old man." I also wrote back to tell him: "Life at home is very good. As a child on the front line, be brave and go forward, and don't miss home." At the county's conference of representatives of military families and martyrs, I participated as a model military dependent. The happiness in my heart is really unspeakable! Narrated by Liu Zhongkun (Recorded by Li Hui)
    Main Situation of Reader Letters in a Week
    From January 11th to 17th, the Reader Letters Group of this newspaper received a total of 1,243 letters, and various agencies investigated, processed, and responded to 220 letters.
    (1) The broad masses of people support the launching of a nationwide movement to implement the Marriage Law:
    Wang Xiaoqin from Guangxi wrote to reflect that the Guangxi Provincial Democratic Women's Federation had sent four investigation teams to Nanning and Guilin cities and Laibin and Yongning counties to investigate the implementation of the Marriage Law and understand the masses' understanding of the Marriage Law. Zhu Xue from the Xin'an District Democratic Women's Federation in Huaining County, Anhui Province, wrote to reflect the situation of their key implementation of the Marriage Law in Wayao Township, and reported their preparations for welcoming the movement to implement the Marriage Law. At the same time, readers Hao Ran and Zheng Sicai wrote to expose the illegal acts of certain district and village cadres who forced marriages and abused women, and demanded that they be inspected and corrected during the movement to implement the Marriage Law, and be dealt with according to law. In addition, many other readers wrote to support the launching of a nationwide movement to implement the Marriage Law.
    (2) After this newspaper published the news of "Soviet Union Cracks Down on Spy and Sabotage Gang" and the editorial "A Major Victory of Soviet National Security Work" on the front page on January 16th, it aroused the attention of the broad masses of readers. The next day, we received ten letters from readers expressing their opinions (some of which were collectively signed); after that, we received a large number of letters from the masses for several consecutive days. In their letters, the masses unanimously expressed their indignation at the despicable conspiracy of American and British imperialism, and expressed that they would be more vigilant and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries in the future; some readers especially pointed out that the motherland is currently starting large-scale basic construction, and it is necessary to strengthen security work, and promptly inspect and correct paralysis of thought, in order to ensure that the motherland smoothly moves towards industrialization.
    In addition, we also received letters reflecting the current situation that students in universities and middle schools have excessive homework, lack of rest and exercise time, which affects students' health. Some readers also wrote to reflect the serious situation in some areas where primary schools are taking commandist approaches to force over-age children to drop out of school.

    祝贺苏联保安工作胜利提高警惕保卫祖国建设
    ——读者来信综述
    苏联最近破获特务暗害集团的消息，在广大读者中间引起了很大的反应。许多读者写信给本报，他们一方面对帝国主义利用披着教授与医生外衣的特务间谍企图暗害苏联领袖的阴谋表示极大愤怒，一方面为苏联国家保安工作这次获得重大胜利而兴奋。读者们并且在信里一致表示，一定要接受教训，提高警惕，加强保卫我国人民的安全与祖国伟大的建设工作。
    北京市公安局王起、庞淑阁来信说：苏联破获特务间谍暗害集团的事实，“对我们的教育意义很大。……为了迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设，我们人人都应提高警惕，消除马虎态度和高枕无忧的思想。敌人是不会因为我们的力量日渐强大而放弃它们的破坏阴谋的。”另一位公安人员马夫同志来信说：苏联破获特务暗害集团的事实，“使我再一次认识到公安工作在祖国建设中的责任的重大。……我们知道，我们的胜利越大，敌人的破坏活动也就会更加卑鄙和恶毒，他们的破坏勾当也就更加会隐蔽起来。”他又说，“随着国家大规模建设的开始，公安工作是更加重要了，我们要以加倍的警惕来保卫我们的生产建设。”北京机器制造工业学校寿鹤年来信说：“只要在帝国主义侵略势力还没有被消灭的时候，我们就一刻也不应该忽略对帝国主义的特务间谍和一切反革命分子的斗争。”“每一个人都有责任来保卫祖国、保卫领袖与人民的安全，决不容许间谍、特务和反革命分子来破坏。”
    还有的读者并且提出了具体的建议，如邮局工作人员陈步湘来信说，“我们每一个人必须随时提高警惕，不论在工作中，生活中，都要谨慎小心，绝不能有一丝一毫的疏忽大意，让敌人来钻空子。”他举例说，许多人常常在邮局里丢失很重要的东西，如工作证、出入证、介绍信、户口单、证章、臂章、日记本等，有的日记本上还有很重要的地址和电话号码。“要是这些东西落在坏人手里，就可能用来干坏事，给国家和人民造成损失”。因此，陈步湘说，“我们一定要克服‘革命胜利，高枕无忧’的错误思想，时刻谨防敌人，以保卫祖国的安全和人民的美好生活。”
    伊克昭盟区牧民的两个要求
    编者按：下面发表的是绥远省伊克昭盟自治区牧民乌兰达赖和米什格尔等来信，他们提出了把黑山羊改种为白山羊以及供给牧民抓剪羊毛工具等两个问题，据本报记者调查，确是当地蒙汉牧民在牧业生产中的共同要求。本报记者当即和伊克昭盟自治区人民政府联系，他们认为这两个要求都是合理的、应该重视的，并且提出了初步解决的办法。关于把黑山羊改种为白山羊的问题，伊克昭盟自治区人民政府已决定首先大力使用盟内白公山羊和黑母山羊配种，并向外区联系购买白公山羊；当然，这个问题需要较长时间才能彻底解决。关于牧民要求供给工具自行抓剪羊绒羊毛的问题，伊克昭盟自治区人民政府已与当地供销合作总社研究，决定由合作社作好工具需要量的调查统计和购运等准备工作（由人民银行贷款），在今春抓剪春毛前即可把抓子、剪刀贷放下去；约在三年内，全盟牧民都可自己抓剪羊绒羊毛。
    我们很少接到少数民族地区的来信，特别是边远地区的少数民族的来信。为了加强本报和各少数民族的联系，我们希望能经常接到反映少数民族地区人民生活、生产和各方面要求的来信。
    养黑山羊太不合算了
    编辑同志：伊克昭盟自治区蒙汉牧民们现有的山羊，绝大部分是黑色的。如郡王旗在现有的二十一万多只羊中，只有不足四百只的白山羊。不管是黑山羊和白山羊，我们放牧时所花费的本钱和劳动力是一样的，但因黑山羊的绒和毛都不能染其他颜色，工业上的用量小，价格就低。我们养黑山羊的收益比养白山羊的收益几乎少一半。如去年的黑山羊绒每斤是三万五千元，毛是六千七百元，白山羊 绒每斤是五万五千元，毛是一万一千二百元。黑羊皮和白羊皮的价格也有很大的差额。因此，我们就感觉到放黑山羊太不合算，想把黑山羊都改种成白山羊。但因我们现有的白山羊太少，不容易买到好羊种，改起来也就非常困难。听说离我们不远的乌兰察布盟以及较远的内蒙古自治区的其他各盟，白山羊非常多。我们邻省宁夏，也有一种毛长肉多的白羊。只要人民政府和贸易、合作社部门注意帮助我们，这个问题是不难解决的。为了使我们牧业能够更好地为工业服务，也为了我们牧民能够增加收入，我建议伊克昭盟自治区人民政府和绥远省人民政府设法帮助我们逐步实现这个愿望。

    牧民需要抓剪羊绒羊毛的工具
    编辑同志：我们是绥远省伊克昭盟自治区的牧民，我们要求人民政府协助我们解决自己抓剪羊绒羊毛所需的工具问题。
    解放前，我们一向把羊绒和羊毛包给边商抓剪。边商经常把绒和毛的价格压得很低；并且很不爱惜我们的羊，每年总要抓死剪死不少羊。牧民们受损失相当大。
    解放后，国营贸易公司和合作社把抓剪绒毛的工作大部承揽了下来，使我们减少了不少损失。如前年春天，许多私商抓剪一只羊的绒毛只给价六千元，合作社就给八千元。我们牧民当时都十分拥护人民政府这种正确的做法。
    但是，随着牧业生产的发展，我们逐渐感觉这种作法已不能满足我们的要求。因为合作社和贸易公司抓剪羊绒和羊毛的工人人数有限，而牧区辽阔、牧民居住分散，他们的抓剪工作就只好早下手、晚收兵。这样，有许多羊抓得太早，羊绒还在羊皮上长得很结实，不容易全部抓下来；假若勉强全部抓剪下来，羽羊就会禁不住冷风的侵袭而死亡。有些羊抓得太迟，羊绒就会自行脱落一部分。像杭锦旗去年一直到六月间还没有抓剪完，十万多只羊就损失一千多万元的绒。晚抓的羊因为天热、绒多、毛长，还容易生病致死；而牧民因为在绒毛卖出以前没有钱添置单衣，大热天还有人翻穿着老羊皮。大家都反映说：人和羊都换不了季。此外，有一部分抓剪绒毛的工人为了赶时间，就抓剪得很粗糙；有的丢掉不少绒，有的用力太大把羊抓伤或抓死了。如郡王旗五区一行政村牧民撒格陆家的四只羊，经合作社抓过后，她又抓出来半斤绒（一只羊总共才能产绒六两）。全郡王旗去年被抓伤致死的羊就有九十八只。
    就是这样，每抓剪一只羊，牧民们还要负担近九百元的工资。因此，牧民们普遍觉得如果由自己下手抓剪，合作社和贸易公司作好收购工作，那末，不但可以避免以上缺点，以利畜牧业的发展；而且还可以使我们牧民相对的增加很多收入。
    据我们了解，我们牧民有很多会抓剪绒毛的；不会的可以同会的人变工互助，而且也会很快地掌握这个技术。因此，我们牧民自己抓剪绒毛，唯一的问题就是缺乏工具——两把抓子和一把剪子。但我们认为这也是容易解决的，三件工具总共才值三万元左右，当地就可以制作，合作社里原来就有很多旧的，而且我们牧民并不需要家家有一套工具。因此我们共同建议伊克昭盟自治区人民政府、合作社和贸易公司，能够帮助我们解决这个问题，使畜牧业得到更大的发展，我们牧民的生活再提高一步。

    模范军属刘忠昆的愉快
    编辑同志：我叫刘忠昆，湖南省永兴县三区高亭乡人。自从抗美援朝运动开始，我的三儿子刘三富参加中国人民志愿军后，我就成了光荣的军属。土地改革时，我家分到二十四石谷的田。村里人要给我代耕，我想，我虽五十多岁了，但还可以劳动，所以我坚决不要代耕。去年搞爱国丰产运动，大伙说我年老有经验，选我做水利委员。我一共管了四垅水，关系着六百石谷的田。一开始，我就注意存田水、查漏洞、补缺口等工作。每天我早出晚归，设法不浪费一滴水。去年六月间，虽然天旱了一些日子，但没有干死一棵稻禾。结果丰产了。我的那
    一个互助组即比原计划增产百分之三十。我一家人的生活都过得很好了，人民政府硬还要发一百斤军属优待粮给我。我不知该如何感谢毛主席。三富现在朝鲜前线，时常写信来说：“部队里生活好，又学文化。同志们像兄弟样亲爱。老人家莫挂念。”我也回信告诉他：“家里日子过得很好。孩子在前方，要勇敢向前，千万莫想家。”在县里的军工烈属代表大会，我是以模范军属的名义参加的。我内心的愉快真是说不完呵！ 刘中昆述（李徽记）
