    Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly passed a vote on January 6th, approving Radical Socialist leader René Mayer as the new Prime Minister of France.
    In order to gather the necessary "parliamentary majority" to form a new government, Mayer guaranteed that the new government would seek to amend the "European Army" treaty through an "additional protocol" to "limit the extent to which French troops are incorporated into the European Army." He also guaranteed that he would not ask the parliament to approve the "European Army" treaty if it was not amended. After Mayer made the above guarantees, the National Assembly passed the authorization for Mayer to form a cabinet by a vote of 389 to 205. Those who supported Mayer included 81 of the 85 members of the French People's Rally (Gaullist party).
    After Mayer was approved as the new Prime Minister, French Foreign Minister Schuman, who was touted by the United States as the "living symbol of European unity," announced that he was not prepared to serve as Foreign Minister in the new government.
    Mayer's compromising guarantees and Schuman's announcement that he would no longer serve as Foreign Minister illustrate that the United States' "United Europe" plan, especially the "European Army" plan, is facing increasing difficulties. The London "Times" commented on Mayer's authorization to form a cabinet, believing that it was now extremely unlikely that the French National Assembly would approve the "European Army" treaty. An Associated Press dispatch from Paris on January 7th commented on the guarantees Mayer made upon taking office:
    "This means at least a further delay in the US-backed plan to recruit 500,000 West German troops to join Western defense." The Associated Press also reported: "French parliamentarians generally hope to postpone the approval of the European Army treaty indefinitely. ... If this negative attitude continues to develop, then at the meeting of the North Atlantic countries scheduled for this spring, relations between France and the United States will encounter a crisis, because Washington firmly supports this plan."

    迈耶勉强组成法国内阁
    【新华社九日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会于一月六日通过由激进社会党领袖雷纳·迈耶担任法国新总理。
    迈耶为了凑足组成一个新政府所必要的“议会多数”，曾保证新政府将谋求以“附加议定书”的方式修改“欧洲军”条约，以“限制法国军队并入欧洲军的程度”。他并且保证，“欧洲军”条约如果没有经过修改，他决不要求议会批准。在迈耶作了上述保证后，国民议会就以三八九票对二○五票通过了授权迈耶组阁，支持迈耶的包括法兰西人民联盟（戴高乐党）八十五个议员中的八十一人。
    在迈耶被通过为新总理后，被美国捧为“欧洲统一的活的象征”的法国原任外交部长舒曼宣布他不准备再在新政府中担任外交部长。
    迈耶的妥协的保证和舒曼宣告不再担任外交部长，说明美国的“统一欧洲”的计划特别是“欧洲军”计划遭到了愈来愈大的困难。伦敦“泰晤士报”评论迈耶受权组阁事件时，认为法国国民议会在最近批准“欧洲军”条约已是极不可能的了。美联社巴黎七日电评论迈耶上台时所作的保证说：
    “这意味着至少要进一步拖延美国所支持的征募五十万西德军队参加西方防务的计划。”美联社的消息并说：“法国议员普遍希望把批准欧洲军条约问题无限期拖延下去。……假如这种消极的态度继续发展下去，那么，在北大西洋各国预定今春举行的会议上，法国和美国的关系将要遭遇危机，因为华盛顿是坚决支持这个计划的。”
