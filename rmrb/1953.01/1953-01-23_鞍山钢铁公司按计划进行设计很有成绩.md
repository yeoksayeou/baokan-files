Xinhua News Agency: The design work of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company has made great achievements, and is gradually entering a stage of planned execution. Since July of last year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department has formulated plans for design progress, labor allocation, and technical measures; by carrying out design work according to the plan, the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department completed major design tasks last year. They completed the design for the renovation of the No. 7 and No. 8 blast furnaces into automated systems, and also completed the design of a series of projects to support the production of the blast furnaces, such as coke ovens, power plant boilers, blowers, and gas scrubbing chambers. The design work they did for the No. 7 and No. 8 blast furnace systems included fifty items, compiling a total of four volumes of preliminary design books, twenty-two volumes of technical design books, and drawing more than four thousand construction drawings. Over the past year, in terms of collecting original data in coordination with foreign designs, the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department has sent more than three hundred copies of data and more than eight thousand seven hundred drawings to design locations, and translated more than nine million words of the overall preliminary design of Anshan Iron and Steel and the technical design books of other new factories, traced more than twenty thousand drawings, reproduced more than ten thousand drawings, and taken more than one thousand photographs. The Design Department also designed forty-four temporary projects and conducted reviews of more than ninety projects. These achievements have never been seen before in the history of metallurgical engineering design in China.

In their work, the Anshan Iron and Steel design personnel have initially learned from the advanced Soviet design standards. For example, the No. 8 blast furnace was designed once in 1951 using capitalist country standards. According to the capacity of that design, it required 1.3 cubic meters of effective volume to produce one ton of iron. However, after redesigning it last year according to Soviet standards, it now takes less than one cubic meter to produce one ton of iron. In terms of administrative management of design, according to Soviet experience, the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department has established a system of overall responsible persons for each engineering design, and has universally promoted advanced methods such as "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" and assembly line operations in design work. These have laid a good foundation for the future massive design tasks of Anshan Iron and Steel.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department has already sorted out and analyzed this year's design projects in early January, and determined the order of priority according to their importance and urgency. Currently, they have begun to consider the design projects for 1954. Planning will be further improved in their design work.

    鞍山钢铁公司按计划进行设计很有成绩
    国营鞍山钢铁公司设计工作有了很大成绩，逐步走上有计划进行的阶段。从去年七月起，鞍钢设计处就定出了设计进度、劳动力调配和技术措施等计划；按照计划进行设计工作，所以去年鞍钢设计处完成了重大的设计任务。他们完成了改建成自动化的第七、第八两炼铁炉的设计，同时完成了配合炼铁炉生产的一系列工程，如炼焦炉、发电厂锅炉、鼓风机、煤气洗涤室等的设计。他们所作的第七、第八两炼铁炉系统的设计工作计有五十项，共编制初步设计书四卷，技术设计书二十二卷，绘制施工图四千多张。一年来，在配合国外设计收集原始资料方面，鞍钢设计处先后发往设计地点的资料有三百多份，图纸八千七百多张，并翻译了鞍钢总体初步设计及其他新建工厂的技术设计书九百多万字，描图二万多张，复印图十多万张，拍照一万多张。设计处还设计了四十四项临时工程，进行了九十多项工程的审查工作。这些成绩在我国黑色冶金工程设计史上是从来没有过的。
    鞍钢设计人员在工作中初步学习了苏联先进的设计标准。如第八炼铁炉在一九五一年曾用资本主义国家标准设计过一次，根据那次设计的能力，要一点三立方公尺有效容积才能出一吨铁，而去年根据苏联标准重新设计后，现在不到一立方公尺就能出一吨铁了。在设计的行政管理方面，根据苏联经验，鞍钢设计处建立了每项工程设计的总负责人制，并普遍推行了设计工作“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”和流水作业等先进方法。这些，都为今后鞍钢庞大的设计任务打下了良好的基础。
    鞍钢设计处已于一月初整理和分析了今年的设计项目，分别轻重缓急定出了次序。目前，他们已开始考虑一九五四年的设计项目。计划性将要在他们的设计工作中更加提高。    　（新华社）
