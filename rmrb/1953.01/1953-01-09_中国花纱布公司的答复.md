    China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Reply
    People's Daily Reader Letters Group: Reader Yu Dianshi's suggestion regarding not cutting the ends of processed (bleached, printed, and dyed) whole cloth is correct. In June 1952, a conference convened by the Central Textile Industry Department studied the method of not limiting the length of cloth, but it was not implemented due to difficulties in acceptance and allocation. In order to avoid the loss of cutting the ends of finished cloth, it is now decided to stipulate the length and width of various white-ground cloths (grey cloth) based on the production equipment conditions and finished cloth specifications when weaving them. In addition, it has been decided to change to weaving double-linked, triple-linked, or quadruple-linked grey cloth in the future, in order to reduce the time spent on sewing heads and the loss of sewing thread during the dyeing and finishing production process, and to improve production efficiency.

    中国花纱布公司的答复
    人民日报社读者来信组：读者于殿试提出的关于加工（漂印染）后的整布不要剪头的建议是正确的。在一九五二年六月中央纺织工业部召开的一个会议上曾研究了布匹不限长度的办法，但因考虑到验收、调拨时的困难，未能实施。为了避免成品布匹剪头的损失，现决定在织制各种白地布（坯布）时，根据生产设备条件和成品布匹规格来规定其长宽度。此外，并决定今后改织双连、三连或四连的坯布，以便在加染生产过程中减少缝头时间和缝头线的损耗，提高生产效率。
