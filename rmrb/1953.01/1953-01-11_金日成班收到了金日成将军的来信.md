    Received a Letter from General Kim Il-sung

    “To all the comrades of the Kim Il-sung Class of Beijing Yucai Middle School, China: I thank you on behalf of all the comrades of the Korean People's Army for your resolute opposition to the American aggressors, your great concern for the liberation war of the Korean nation, and your active support and sincere condolences to the Korean People's Army.

    Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
                    November 20, 1952"

    The class president's voice was drowned out by a sudden burst of cheers, applause, and singing. Gloves, scarves, and hats flew into the air. Students hugged each other, sang, and shouted, and no one heard the content of the letter clearly. They were asking the class president to read it again when the class bell rang. They quickly returned to their seats, but they couldn't calm down. When they saw the teacher enter, they couldn't help but shout, "General Kim Il-sung sent us a letter!" With the teacher's permission, the class president read General Kim Il-sung's letter again in class.

    How should we respond to General Kim Il-sung's concern?

    The next day, the class meeting issued a call: to complete all extracurricular assignments, not to bring the 1952 assignments into 1953; to consolidate study order, not to talk or be late in class, to respect teachers, and to strive for everyone to pass every subject… At the end of 1952, they gloriously reported to General Kim Il-sung: for four consecutive weeks, the entire class had 100% completion of extracurricular assignments; the class’s average grade in the first quarter was 81.6, making it the best-performing class in the senior high school; physical exercise, recreational activities, and cleanliness were all rewarded and commended. They assured General Kim Il-sung: "In the future, we will study even more diligently and become useful talents for the construction of our motherland."

    The Origin of the Kim Il-sung Class

    The origin of the Kim Il-sung class dates back two years. After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the students of Class C of the second year of senior high school at Yucai Middle School (now renamed Beijing No. 25 Middle School) closely watched the development of the Korean war situation, just like all the young students in China; they loved the Korean people fighting to defend their national independence, and they also loved General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people in their struggle for freedom and liberation. The entire class went to the Korean Embassy to meet with the then Ambassador Li Zhouyuan, sent a telegram to Korea, and obtained the consent of General Kim Il-sung to name their class the Kim Il-sung Class. Since then, they have regularly reported their learning progress to General Kim Il-sung and maintained close contact with some students of Kim Il-sung University who were studying in Beijing. Encouraged by General Kim Il-sung's name, the academic performance of this class has greatly improved. When they were about to graduate last summer, the entire class discussed that they must maintain the honor of the Kim Il-sung class in the school. They decided to find the best class in the school to pass on this glorious title to them. Class A of the second year of senior high school was relatively outstanding in their studies. They held a transfer ceremony and invited a counselor from the Korean Embassy to speak. During the transfer, all the students swore: "From today onwards, I am a member of the Kim Il-sung Class… I guarantee that in future study, life, and various activities, I will never tarnish the glorious title of the Kim Il-sung Class, and I will resolutely be a good student of General Kim Il-sung." Cherishing the Honor of the Kim Il-sung Class

    Young people love honor, cherish honor, and especially love and cherish collective honor. General Kim Il-sung's concern for them has become a driving force for their progress. They received the "Advance News" of the People's Army sent from Korea, apples sent from Korea, and also paintings sent from Korea. This was the only one of the many posters sent by the Korean people to the Chinese people, and it was designated to be sent to the Kim Il-sung Class. When the comrades of the Korean Embassy handed the painting to the class president of the Kim Il-sung Class, they specifically told him: "General Kim Il-sung has read the letters and telegrams from the Kim Il-sung Class to him, but he is busy and doesn't have time to reply. But General Kim Il-sung is very concerned about you, and he also asked: 'How are the students of the Kim Il-sung Class studying?'"

    The class president stood in front of all the students holding the painting, and he conveyed General Kim Il-sung's question: "How are the students of the Kim Il-sung Class studying?" Many students lowered their heads. Huo Chunzhuang remembered that he had not completed his extracurricular assignments on time, Huang Chuandi thought that his foreign language was not good, Xie Shouchun remembered that he did not obey the rules in class and often joked with others, Ren Xuan remembered that he liked to talk in class, Zhang Cunji remembered that he was often late… At this time, the class president spoke again: "General Kim Il-sung is concerned about our studies, how should we answer him?" A voice rang out: "Only the best class is qualified to accept this precious gift. Our class is not qualified to hang this painting now. I suggest we hang it up when our class becomes the best class."

    The next day, a rolled-up painting appeared on the back wall of the classroom. The blackboard newspaper on the right showed the class meeting's specific call.

    From then on, everyone often heard the phrase: "How are the students of the Kim Il-sung Class studying?" They knew that General Kim Il-sung's concern for them was also a concern for all the young students in China; they had to represent all the young students in China to answer this question. The school was inspecting the completion of extracurricular assignments in each class. The situation was not good. Some classes completed 40% or 50%, some 60% or 70%, and they, the class that had always been ahead, had only reached 60%. To reach 100%, for all students to complete all extracurricular assignments, was not easy. It required mutual assistance, and it required everyone to cultivate a conscious study habit: to complete the day's homework on the same day, and never fall behind. Everyone thought: "Never tarnish the honor of the Kim Il-sung Class." In winter, skating was a tempting sport, but when the homework was not finished, and the students clamored to go skating, they would hear: "How are the students of the Kim Il-sung Class studying?" The extracurricular assignments were finally completed.

    A week later, the class meeting's call was fulfilled. In the song of "General Kim Il-sung," sung by them in Korean, the painting slowly unfolded. Before them, General Kim Il-sung's solemn and gentle face appeared, and below were groups of jet planes, moving tanks, and firing cannons. The flags of the evil aggressors fell to the ground. "For the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland," General Kim Il-sung pointed to the direction of the Korean People's Army's attack, and also pointed out the direction for the students to study hard.

    金日成班收到了金日成将军的来信

    接到了金日成将军的来信
    “中国、北京市育英中学金日成班
    全体学员同志：你们坚决反对美国侵略者，对我朝鲜民族的解放战争抱着极大关怀，对我朝鲜人民军给以积极支援与诚挚的慰问，我兹代表朝鲜人民军全体同志们表示谢意。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相    金日成
                    一九五二年十一月二十日”
    班主席的声音，被淹没在一阵突然迸发的欢呼、掌声和歌声里，手套、围巾和帽子飞向半空，同学们拥抱着、唱着、叫着，谁也没有听清楚信的内容。他们正要求班主席再念一遍，上课的钟声响了。他们迅速地回到座位上，却无论如何安静不下来。看到老师进来都忍不住嚷了起来：“金日成将军给我们来信啦。”得到老师的允许，班主席把金日成将军的来信又在课堂上念了一遍。
    怎样来回答金日成将军的关怀呢？
    第二天，班会提出了号召：全部完成课外作业，不把一九五二年的作业带到一九五三年去；巩固学习秩序，上课不说话，不迟到，对老师尊敬，争取每个人每门功课都及格……。一九五二年底，他们光荣地向金日成将军报告：接连四个星期，全班百分之百完成课外作业；全班第一季度学业平均分数是八十一点六，是高中部成绩最优良的一个班；体育锻炼、文娱活动和清洁卫生都受到了奖励和表扬。他们向金日成将军保证：“今后要加倍顽强地学习，成为建设祖国有用的人才。”
    金日成班的来历
    要说起金日成班的来历，已经是两年以前的事了。一九五○年朝鲜战争爆发后，当时还是育英中学（现改为北京市立第二十五中学）高二丙班的学生，和全中国青年学生一样，密切地注视着朝鲜战局的发展；他们热爱着为保卫祖国独立而斗争的朝鲜人民，也热爱着领导朝鲜人民争取自由、解放斗争的朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军。他们全班到朝鲜大使馆去，与当时的李周渊大使见面，打电报到朝鲜，取得金日成将军的同意，把他们这个班命名为金日成班。以后他们经常把学习情况向金日成将军汇报，又和在北京学习的金日成综合大学的一部分学生保持密切联系。在金日成将军名字的鼓舞下，这一班的学习成绩都有很大提高。当他们去年夏天要毕业的时候，全班商量一定要把金日成班的荣誉在学校保持下来。他们决定要找一个全校最好的班来把这个光荣的称号转给他们。当时的高二甲班在学习中是比较突出的。他们举行了转班仪式，还请朝鲜大使馆一位参赞来讲了话。在转班时全体学员都宣誓：“从今天起我是金日成班的一个成员……保证在今后的学习生活及各种运动中，决不沾污金日成班这光荣的称号，坚决做金日成将军的好学生。”珍惜金日成班的荣誉
    青年都热爱荣誉，珍惜荣誉，特别热爱和珍惜集体的荣誉。金日成将军对他们的关怀，更成了推动他们前进的力量。他们收到从朝鲜寄来的人民军的“前进报”，收到从朝鲜寄来的苹果，还收到朝鲜寄来的画。这是朝鲜人民送给中国人民许多招贴画中仅有的一张，是指定送给金日成班的。朝鲜大使馆的同志将画交给金日成班的班主席时，特别告诉他：“金日成班给金日成将军的信和电报他都看过了，因为忙，没有时间答复。但是金日成将军是很关心你们的，他还问起：‘金日成班的学生学习得怎么样？’”
    班主席拿着画站在全班同学的面前，他转达了金日成将军的问话：“金日成班的学生学习得怎么样？”许多同学的头低了下来，霍春庄想起他的课外作业没有按时完成，黄传第想他的外国语文学得不好，谢寿椿想起他在上课时不遵守秩序，老爱跟人开玩笑，任萱想起他上课爱说话，张存济想起他常迟到……这时候，班主席又说话了：“金日成将军在关心着我们的学习，我们怎样回答他呢？”一个声音响了起来：“只有最优秀的班才能接受这珍贵的礼物，现在我们班没有资格挂这幅画，我建议等我们班成为最优秀班的时候再挂起来。”
    第二天，在教室后面墙上出现了一幅卷起的画。右面黑板报上出现了班会的具体号召。
    从此，每个同学的耳边常常响着这句话：“金日成班的学生学习得怎么样？”他们知道金日成将军对他们的关怀，也就是对全中国青年学生的关怀；他们必须代表全中国的青年学生来回答这个询问。学校正在检查各班完成课外作业的情况。情况不大好，有的班完成百分之四十、五十，有的百分之六、七十，他们，这一向走在前面的班，也不过到达百分之六十。要达到百分之百，全部同学完成全部的课外作业，这不是很容易的。需要互助，需要每个人培养自觉的学习习惯：当天功课当天作完，决不拉下来。每个人都想着：“决不沾污金日成班的荣誉。”冬天，溜冰是诱人的运动，但是作业没有做完，同学们嚷着去溜冰的时候，他们耳边会响起：“金日成班的学生学习得怎么样？”课外作业终于坚持完成了。
    一星期以后，班会的号召都做到了。在他们用朝鲜文唱着的“金日成将军之歌”的歌声中，画幅徐徐展了开来。在他们面前，赫然出现了金日成将军庄严而温和的脸容，下面是喷气机群、开动的坦克和发射的大炮，罪恶的侵略者的旗帜倒在地下。“为了祖国的独立、自由和荣誉”，金日成将军用手指着朝鲜人民军进攻的方向，也指出了同学们努力学习的方向。
