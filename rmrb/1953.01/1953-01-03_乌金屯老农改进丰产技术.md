    Old Farmers in Wujintun Improve High-Yield Techniques
    To the Editor: Nineteen old farmers in Wujintun, Shaojia Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, went to the fields to measure ridges, check stubble, and examine plant spacing. Using examples, they studied high-yield experiences, breaking the conservative thinking of many people.

    They went to Zheng Fuhai's sorghum field, which had the highest yield in the village (795 jin per mu), measured the ridge width, and determined the number of plants per square meter, and the distance between plants. They also went to Wang Jian's sorghum field, which they determined represented the general yield of the village (245 jin less per mu than Zheng Fuhai's), and carefully conducted on-site measurements. The soil quality of these two plots was similar, and the number of sorghum plants per square meter was the same (seven seedlings each). The distance between the stubble of Zheng Fuhai's sorghum was mostly about six inches; the distance between the stubble of Wang Jian's sorghum was as close as four inches, and as far as one foot eight inches to two feet, and in some places, there were no seedlings for several feet. They also measured the best and general millet and soybean fields. At this point, everyone understood somewhat: If you want to harvest more grain, it's not enough to just apply fertilizer, it's not enough to just select seeds, and it's not enough for the seedlings to be sparse or dense. You must combine all aspects to increase yield.

    Some people also thought: This year (1952) was a good year, with favorable rainfall, so we could harvest this much grain; in another year, we wouldn't be able to. Some also believed: This land can only yield this much; it's difficult to get more. For example, Zheng Fuhai said: "My sorghum doesn't lack seedlings, doesn't lack fertilizer, and is carefully managed. I spent twelve workdays just thinning the seedlings on that large field, and there were no problems with uneven density, and there were no disasters. That's why I harvested so much. It's difficult to harvest more!" Is Old Zheng's sorghum yield really at its "limit"? This question sparked another debate among everyone. Finally, they marked the ridge length on the ground and determined the most suitable plant spacing and sowing width. Using corn kernels, they placed them on the ground, and the result was that, in the form of "dog bite marks," each plant was six inches apart, and exactly ten kernels could be placed in one square meter. After this arrangement, everyone understood that Zheng's sorghum could have three more plants per square meter. This means that a large field was short of 30,000 seedlings. At this point, those who thought that production could not be increased any further nodded and admitted that production could be increased. Old Zheng said: "If you calculate it that way, then there's no doubt! I didn't think of it that way before."

    Everyone spent three days discussing the planting methods for sorghum, millet, and soybeans, and unanimously agreed that increasing production was certain. Old farmer Long Weichuan said: "In the past, we only looked at the small things and not the big things. We were afraid of wasting labor when planting, and we were always calculating on saving labor, but in the end, we suffered losses ourselves." Sun Changshan said: "We must correct the problem of 'being stingy in the spring (afraid of wasting labor) and regretting in the fall (staring with wide eyes)!" The more they talked, the more energetic they became. Sun Changshan suddenly stood up and said to everyone: "Planting is really as rough as a large vat, and as fine as cow's hair. In the future, we must plant carefully and evenly!" Everyone felt that they had solved a problem that had not been solved for a long time, and felt that Chairman Gao Gang's call to double agricultural production within five years was achievable.

    乌金屯老农改进丰产技术
    编辑同志：吉林省舒兰县邵家村乌金屯十九个老农，到地里实地量垅、查槎、看株距，用实例研究丰产经验，把许多人的保守思想打破了。
    他们到了全屯产量最高的郑富海的高粱地里（每亩打了七百九十五斤），量了垅宽，测定了每平方公尺的棵数，量了棵与棵的距离。又到大家确定能代表全屯一般产量的王俭的高粱地里（比郑富海每亩少打二百四十五斤），仔细地进行了实测工作。这两块耕地的土质差不多，每平方公尺内高粱棵数相等（都是七棵苗）。老郑的高粱槎的距离多是六寸左右；王俭的高粱槎的距离最近的是四寸，远的是一尺八到二尺，还有的地方好几尺远没有苗。他们又量了最好的和一般的谷子地、豆子地。这时大家有些明白了：要想多打粮，光上粪不行，光选种不行，苗稀了厚了都不行，必须各方面结合起来，才能增加产量。
    有的人又想到：今年（一九五二年）年头好，雨水调和，才能打这些粮；换个年成说啥也不能。有的又认为：这样地也就打这些了，再多也很难了。例如郑富海说：“我那高粱，一不缺苗，二不缺粪，整得也仔细，一垧多地光间苗就用了十二个工，没有稀稠不匀的毛病，又没啥灾害，才打了那么多。再想多打，难哪！”老郑的高粱产量究竟是不是
    “顶天”了呢？这个问题又引起了大家的争论，最后他们在地上划了垅长，并确定了最合适的株距和播幅，用苞米粒往上摆起来，摆的结果，用“狗咬纹”的形式，每株距离六寸远，一平方公尺正好可以摆十粒。经过这样一摆，大家就明白了，老郑的高粱每平方公尺还可以再加三棵。这样一垧地就少三万棵苗。这时，那些认为不能再增加产量的人，也点头承认可以再增产了。老郑头说：“这么算，那可没跑！我原先没这么想。”
    大家用三天工夫把高粱、谷子、豆子的种法都讨论了，一致认为：增产是有把握的。老农龙蔚川说：“我们过去都看小头不看大头，种地怕费工，老在使工上打算盘，最后还是自己吃亏。”孙长山说：“可得改正‘春天小心眼（怕费工）秋天瞪大眼（后悔）’的毛病了！”他们越谈越有劲。孙长山猛地站起来向大伙说道：“种地可真是粗如大缸，细如牛毛。以后一定要细致地种，把地种匀！”大家感到解决了一件好久没有解决的问题，觉得高岗主席号召五年内农业生产增加一倍，是有把握办到的。  刘继勋
