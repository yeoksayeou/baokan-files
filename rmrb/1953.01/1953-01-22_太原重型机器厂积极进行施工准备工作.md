    Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is actively carrying out preparatory work to welcome large-scale construction this year.
    The plant's construction preparation work this year is being carried out based on a comprehensive summary of the past two and a half years of work, and in accordance with the requirements of this year's engineering tasks. It is roughly divided into three aspects: First, the adjustment of the organizational structure. The main shortcoming last year was the unsoundness of the organization. For example, the planning department could not truly undertake the task of formulating plans and supervising the implementation of the plans; there was no organization specifically responsible for ordering machines. Although the domestic and foreign equipment orders had been sent out, there was no one specifically in charge of whether these equipment could arrive on time; there was no special organization or manpower responsible for installing equipment, and many urgently needed equipment, such as the domestically rare 1,000-ton hydraulic press, could not be installed in time, causing a disconnect with civil construction; the technical force was already weak, but it was dispersed and used in a decentralized manner, resulting in the phenomenon that the design lagged behind the construction and delayed the start date. This year's engineering tasks exceed twice that of last year. Based on this requirement and the lessons learned last year, in addition to expanding the departments directly under the original preparatory office into divisions, the plant has particularly strengthened the following five organizations: First, expand and improve the construction organization, establish a Civil Engineering Division, under which are three sections: Design Supervision, Construction Management, Accounting and Statistics, and an Engineering Brigade; Second, establish a Political Division to strengthen the political education of employees, and is currently concentrating on winter training; Third, establish an Equipment Installation Workshop, organize installation forces, and has now transferred cadres and workers; Fourth, concentrate design forces to strengthen the Technical Division. The forces have now been fully concentrated and are carrying out professional division of labor, implementing a design responsibility system, and unifying design plans; Fifth, improve the economic accounting system in order to implement the economic accounting system this year. All the above-mentioned organizational adjustments were completed in late December last year.
    Second, fix construction workers and conduct winter training. The plant has fixed more than 900 technicians as long-term workers, and has signed seasonal contracts with more than 700 workers. The Winter Training Work Committee has been established, and more than 70 cadres have been transferred to be specifically responsible for winter training. The training class started in mid-December last year, with more than 900 technicians participating in the study, including concrete, water supply, electrical, heating, bricklaying, and carpentry workers. At present, political education is being carried out. After learning about the "Comparison of the Status of the Working Class in the Old and New Societies," the students have corrected their learning attitudes and settled down to study. More than 60% of the students have already made study plans and launched a learning competition. In addition, training classes for material storage, original records, and supervisors have been held, with a total of 120 students. The Civil Engineering Division organized cadres to study the "Parallel Flow Operation Method Organized According to Instruction Charts" in order to fully implement this advanced construction method this year.
    Third, direct preparation work for construction. The Technical Division is now concentrating on the comprehensive technical design work and the design of equipment installation, the design of self-made equipment such as gas generators, cranes, and open-hearth furnaces, the design of construction machinery - equipment for driving concrete piles, and detailed construction drawings for civil engineering. All detailed construction drawings can be completed by the end of February. The main building materials have been basically prepared. For example, the steel transported to the construction site has reached one-third of the annual requirement; half of the wood has been transported, and is now being mechanically processed; there is no problem with cement, bricks, tiles, and rubble. The preparation work for industrialized construction is about to be completed. The vacuum operation for prefabricating concrete floor slabs has been successfully tested and will soon be mass-produced. In terms of the preparation of construction forces, under the unified leadership of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, four working groups have been sent to rural areas to find labor. At present, in addition to continuing winter training and the above-mentioned construction preparation work, the plant has begun to make detailed construction plans for each project and specific arrangements for site construction. For example, the bricks, tiles, and rubble required for some plant buildings have been placed according to the design drawings and construction plans. As long as the construction season arrives, construction can be started step by step and in a planned manner. (Liu Deliang)

    太原重型机器厂积极进行施工准备工作
    太原重型机器厂积极进行准备工作，迎接今年大规模的施工。
    该厂今年的施工准备工作，是在全面总结了过去两年半的工作以后，根据今年的工程任务要求进行的。大致分三个方面：第一、组织机构的调整。去年主要的缺点是机构不健全，如计划部门不能真正负起制订计划和监督计划的实现的任务；没有专门负责订购机器的组织，国内、国外订购的设备订单虽已送出，但这些设备能否按期到达，则无专人掌握；没有专门负责安装设备的机构和力量，许多急需安装的设备，如国内少有的一千吨水压机未能及时安装，造成与土木建筑脱节的现象；技术力量本来就很弱，却采取分兵把守的办法分散使用，因而造成设计落后于施工的现象，推迟了开工日期。今年的工程任务超过去年的两倍以上。根据这一要求和去年的教训，该厂除把原来筹备处直属的各科扩大为处以外，特别加强了下面五个机构：一、扩大并健全施工组织，成立土木工程处，下设设计监工、施工管理、会计统计三个科和工程大队；二、成立政治处，加强对职工的政治教育工作，目前正集中力量进行冬训工作；三、成立设备安装车间，组织安装力量，现已调配了干部和工人；四、集中设计力量，加强技术处，现在力量已集中完毕，正在进行专业分工，实行设计责任制，统一设计计划；五、健全经济核算系统，以便今年实行经济核算制。上述全部的组织机构的调整工作，已于去年十二月下旬完成。
    第二、固定建筑工人，进行冬训。该厂已经固定了九百多技工为长期工人，并与七百多个工人订立了季节合同。冬训工作委员会已经成立，抽调了七十多个干部专门负责冬训工作。训练班于去年十二月中旬开学，参加学习的有混凝土、给水、电气、暖气、泥瓦、木工等技工九百余人。目前正在进行政治教育，经过了“新旧社会工人阶级地位对比”的学习以后，学员们已经端正了学习态度，安心下来学习。现在已有百分之六十以上的学员订了学习计划，并开展了学习竞赛运动。此外还举办了材料保管、原始纪录、监工人员等训练班，共有学员一百二十人。土木工程处组织干部学习“按指示图表组织平行流水作业法”，以便今年全面实行这一先进的施工方法。
    第三、施工的直接准备工作。技术处现在正集中力量作技术设计的全面综合工作，和制作设备安装设计，自己制造的煤气发生炉、行车、平炉等设备的设计，施工机械——打混凝土桩的设备的设计以及土木工程的施工详图。全部施工详图可在二月底全部完成。主要的建筑材料已基本上准备就绪。如运到工地的钢材已达全年所需的三分之一；木材运到了二分之一，现正进行机械加工；水泥、砖、瓦、片石等都没有问题了。工厂化施工的准备工作即将完成，运用真空作业预制混凝土楼板已经试验成功，不久即可大量生产。施工力量的准备方面，在山西省人民政府统一领导下，已派了四个工作组到农村去找劳动力。现在，该厂除继续进行冬训和上述的施工准备工作外，已经开始作每项工程的详细施工计划和工地施工的具体布置，如部分厂房所需的砖、瓦、片石等已按照设计图和施工计划摆放。只要施工季节来临，就可以有步骤有计划地开工了。    　（刘德良）
