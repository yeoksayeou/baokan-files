    "I have restored my ethnic identity"
    By our correspondent Shen Shi
    When the news of the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government in Guangxi Province was published in the Guangxi Daily, Wei Tianyou, of the Public Security Bureau of the Yao Autonomous Region People's Government in Dayao Mountain, was both happy and astonished. He was happy that the Zhuang people were truly in charge, and astonished that the area inhabited by the Zhuang people extended to 34 counties (including one autonomous region), with a population of over 4.2 million. This was something he had never heard of before.

    At the same time, Wei Tianyou saw that many people who had previously claimed to be Han Chinese were now admitting that they were Zhuang. This reminded him of his own experiences. Last August, when he was transferred from the Pingluo Prefectural Office of Guangxi to the Public Security Bureau of the Yao Autonomous Region in Dayao Mountain, the personnel department asked him to fill out a cadre resume form. After he submitted the completed form, Comrade Deng Huaxiong saw it and said to him, "Tianyou! You are Zhuang, why did you fill in Han on the form?" Deng Huaxiong was his former primary school teacher and also lived in the same village as him, so he knew his situation quite well.

    "Isn't Zhuang and Han the same anyway?" Tianyou replied.

    "How can they be the same? Since you are Zhuang, why don't you admit you are Zhuang? Comrade! Today is no longer the era of the Kuomintang reactionary rule! Chairman Mao's sunshine has brought warmth to our minority nationalities. Are you still afraid of being discriminated against, are you still afraid to say what ethnicity you are?"

    After hearing these words, Wei Tianyou lowered his head and silently took the completed form and left.

    Speaking of filling out forms, it touches some of Wei Tianyou's inner pain. After he joined the revolutionary work, whenever he filled out forms and wrote autobiographies, he would stop writing when he came to the question of his ethnicity, and ask himself, "Should I fill in Han? Or Zhuang?..." At this time, the scenes in his hometown would flash through his mind one by one.

    Shanglong Village, Dumo Township, Mengshan County, is inhabited by Zhuang people. Wei Tianyou grew up in this village. His mother was a Han Chinese, and her family lived in Mengshan City. When Tianyou was seven or eight years old, his mother took him to his maternal grandmother's house. The grandmother held her grandson in her arms, patted his shoulder, and said affectionately, "Tianyou! My Zhuang grandson..." Tianyou's uncles and aunts sometimes joked to scare him, "Let's take this 'Zhuang kid' and sell him..." When Tianyou heard them call him "Zhuang kid" and say they would sell him, he dared not go to his grandmother's house again after returning home.

    Shanglong Village is only a few dozen miles away from Mengshan County, but during the reactionary rule, some residents never went to the city once in their lives. Tianyou's uncle was one of them. One day, his uncle wanted to carry a load of sweet potatoes into the city. Tianyou's father told him, "When you get to the city, remember not to speak the Zhuang language. If the people in the county government hear you, you will suffer." Because Zhuang people from Shanglong Village had suffered a lot for speaking Zhuang in the city. When the personnel of the puppet government heard people speaking Zhuang, they would scold them as "Zhuang kids" or "Zhuang old men." Sometimes when they went to the city to buy things, the merchants would charge them higher prices when they heard them speaking Zhuang. Sometimes they bought back a basket of oil, and when they took it out to use, they found that there was only a thin layer of oil floating on the top, and the rest was all water. When they carried things to the city to sell, the merchants would "greet" them outside the city long ago. After they sold things to these merchants, they would inquire about the market price and find that they had been cheated again. At that time, the Zhuang people were truly "eating bitter herbs like a mute, unable to express their suffering."

    Before liberation, the Zhuang residents of Shanglong Village lived a very hard life. Sometimes they had nothing to eat and had to fry rice until it was burnt, grind it into powder, mix it with water, and stir it into a paste to eat. But the landlords and rich peasants mocked them, saying, "Zhuang people don't follow etiquette, they eat rice with water."

    A custom called "Brother gives cakes on the fifteenth of August, sister gives shoes on the Double Ninth Festival" is popular among the Zhuang people. Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, young men and women from the Zhuang communities sing love songs to each other, choosing their favorite partner. When a girl chooses a boy, they find a secluded place and express their love for each other. At this time, the boy gives the girl a packet of glutinous rice cakes; on the Double Ninth Festival in September, the couple meets at the agreed place again, and the girl gives the boy a pair of handmade cloth shoes. But this custom was ridiculed as "barbaric" by the personnel of the puppet government and the landlords.

    What Wei Tianyou cannot forget most is the scar on his forehead. When he was in elementary school, he was beaten by the children of the landlords for speaking Zhuang, leaving a scar on his forehead. Whenever he touched this scar, he hated the ethnic discrimination he had suffered.

    The ethnic segregation and ethnic discrimination caused by the reactionary rulers' ethnic oppression policy wounded the young Wei Tianyou's heart. After leaving home, Wei Tianyou stopped speaking Zhuang and stopped saying that he was Zhuang. In society, Wei Tianyou felt the ethnic oppression policy of the reactionary rulers even more deeply and dared not say his ethnicity. Since liberation, although he understood the policy of ethnic equality, he still did not admit that he was Zhuang, so he wrote "Han" when filling out the form.

    After Deng Huaxiong talked to him, he decided never to hide his ethnicity again. At the same time, from the letters from his family, he learned that the residents of Shanglong Village and the neighboring Han farmers had united to overthrow the landlords and divide the land; he also saw the changes in the lives of the Yao people in Dayao Mountain. All of this made him feel that the times had changed drastically, and it was completely unnecessary to hide that he was Zhuang. So he took out the cadre resume form again and changed the word "Han" to "Zhuang" in the "Ethnicity" column. He handed the form to the personnel department and happily said to his comrades, "This time I have restored my ethnic identity."

    The Zhuang people have long been forced to hide their ethnicity. Some cadres from minority nationalities often reflected their lingering doubts when filling out registration forms. Wei Tianyou filling out the cadre resume form is just one example of many similar things in minority areas. During the preparation for the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, due to the widespread and in-depth publicity of ethnic policies, people from a village or a township often said that they were Zhuang. From this, people can understand how deep the sins committed by the Kuomintang reactionaries were. Today, a brand-new ethnic relationship has emerged, and millions of Zhuang people have their own political power, and they no longer need to hide their ethnicity. This is because all ethnic groups have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

### “我恢复了自己的民族面目”

    “我恢复了自己的民族面目”
    本报记者  沈石
    广西省桂西僮族自治区人民政府成立的消息在广西日报发表后，大瑶山瑶族自治区人民政府公安局的韦天佑又快乐，又惊异。快乐的是僮族人民真正当家作主了，惊异的是僮族人民聚居的范围竟达三十四县（包括一个自治区），人口竟有四百二十余万，这是他从来没有听到过的事情。
    与此同时，韦天佑看到许多原来说自己是汉族的人现在都承认自己是僮族了，他不禁联想到自己的经历。去年八月，他从广西平乐专署调到大瑶山瑶族自治区公安局工作时，人事科叫他填写干部简历表。他将填好的表交上去后，邓华雄同志看到了，对他说：“天佑！你是僮族，为什么在表上填的汉族呢？”邓华雄是他从前的小学教师，又和他同住在一个村子里，因此对他的情形知道得相当清楚。
    “半斤八两，僮族、汉族还不是一样吗？”天佑回答。
    “怎么说是一样？既然是僮族，为什么不承认是僮族呢？同志！今天已经不是国民党反动统治的时期了！毛主席的阳光已经给我们少数民族带来了温暖，你难道还害怕受到歧视，难道还不敢说出自己是那一种民族吗？”
    韦天佑听了这一番话，低着头，默不作声地拿着填好的表离开了。
    提起填表来，就触到韦天佑内心的一些隐痛。他参加革命工作以后，每当填表和写自传时，一接触到自己的民族成份问题，便将笔停下来，反问着自己：“我到底填汉族呢？还是填僮族？……”这时候，他在家乡的情景，便一幕一幕地翻腾在他的脑海了。
    蒙山县杜莫乡上龙村住的是僮人，韦天佑生长在这村里。他的母亲是汉人，娘家住在蒙山城。天佑七、八岁时，他母亲带着他到外婆家。外祖母把外孙抱在怀里，拍拍他的肩膀，亲切地说：“天佑！我的‘僮崽’外孙……”天佑的舅父、舅母看到外甥，有时也开玩笑吓唬他：“把你这‘僮崽’抱出去卖了……”天佑听到叫他做“僮崽”，还要卖掉他，回家以后，再也不敢上外婆家了。
    上龙村离蒙山县城只有几十里路，但是在反动派统治时期，有的居民一生就没有到城里去过一趟，天佑的叔父便是其中的一个。一天，他叔父要挑一担红薯进城，天佑的父亲叮嘱他说：“你到了城里，切记不要说僮话，县衙门的人听了，你要吃亏的。”因为到城里说僮话，上龙村的僮人曾因此吃过不少苦头。伪政府的人员一听到说僮话的，便骂他们“僮崽”、“僮古佬”，有时他们上城买东西，商人听到是说僮话的，价钱也特别要得贵些。有时他们买回一篓油，取出来使用，发现油篓里只浮着一层薄薄的油，下面尽是水。他们挑东西到城里去卖，商人老早就“迎候”在城外，他们将东西卖给这些商人以后，一打听市价，发觉又吃了亏。那时候，僮族人民真是“哑子吃黄连，说不出的苦。”
    解放前，上龙村的僮族居民生活很苦。他们有时吃不上饭，不得不将米炒焦，磨成粉，掺上水，搅成糊糊来吃。但地主和富农们却讥笑他们说：“僮人不讲礼，吃饭水送米”。
    僮族人民中流行着一种“八月十五哥送饼，九月重阳妹送鞋”的风俗，每当农历八月中秋，僮族聚居地区的年轻男女，这个村子的和那个村子的，对唱着情歌，挑选自己中意的对象。某个少女选中了某个男的，他们便找个僻静的地点，相互谈出爱慕的话。这时候，男的送给女的一包糯米饼；到了九月重阳，这双情侣又到约定的地点相会，女的送给男的一双亲手做的布鞋。但这种风俗，被伪政府的人员和地主们讥笑为“野蛮”。
    最使韦天佑不能忘怀的，是他额上的伤痕。他在小学时，因为说僮话，遭受了地主们的小孩的殴打，额上留下一道伤痕。每当他抚摸这道伤痕时，就痛恨自己所遭受的民族歧视。
    反动统治者的民族压迫政策所造成的民族隔阂和民族歧视，使幼年的韦天佑在心灵上就受到了创伤。离开家庭以后，韦天佑便不说僮话，不说出自己是僮人。在社会上，韦天佑更深刻地感觉到反动统治者的民族压迫政策，就更不敢说出自己的民族成份了。解放以来，虽然他懂得了民族平等的政策，但仍旧不承认自己是僮人，填表时也就写上了“汉族”。
    邓华雄和他谈过以后，他就决心再也不隐瞒自己的民族成份了。同时从自己家人的来信里，他知道上龙村的居民和邻近汉族农民已经团结起来，斗倒了地主，分得了田地；大瑶山瑶民生活上所起的变化，他也看到了。所有这些，都使他感到时代大变了，隐瞒自己是僮族已经完全不必要了。于是他重新将干部简历表拿出来，在“民族”栏内将“汉”字改正为“僮”字了。他把表交给人事科，高兴地对同志们说：“这次我恢复了自己的民族面目。”
    僮族人民曾长期地被迫隐瞒他们的民族成份。某些少数民族的干部在填写登记表格时，时常反映出他们遗留下来的疑虑。韦天佑填写干部简历表，只不过是少数民族地区许多类似事情中的一个例子。在桂西僮族自治区成立的筹备过程中，由于普遍地和较深入地宣传了民族政策，常有一个村、一个乡的人民说出了他们自己是僮族的。从这里，人们可以了解到国民党反动派所造成的罪孽是如何的深重。今天，崭新的民族关系出现了，数百万僮族人民有了自己的政权，他们再不需要隐瞒自己的民族成份了。这就是由于各族人民有了共产党，有了毛主席。
