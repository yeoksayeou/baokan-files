Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 9th:

The Southwest region has successively transferred over 700 outstanding technical workers, technicians, and administrative management cadres to support capital construction throughout the country. Among them are nearly 100 factory directors and cadres at the engineer level and above. In order to meet the needs of national key construction projects, the Southwest region has not only transferred a large number of skilled technical personnel but also some excellent heat treatment workers, furnace builders, and crane operators, who were already in short supply in various factories and mines in the Southwest.

In the transfer process, leading cadres of the Southwest Industrial Department, various industrial bureaus, and various factories and mines attached great importance to this work and personally led its implementation, thus ensuring the smooth and rapid completion of the transfer work. To ensure that cadres at all levels understood the great significance of transferring personnel, the Southwest Industrial Department held several meetings of directors of various industrial bureaus and personnel workers, repeatedly emphasizing the importance of the overall concept of supporting national capital construction; it commended units that resolutely complied with the transfer and set deadlines for units that did not pay enough attention and delayed the work. In the transfer process, individual units had departmentalism, such as the Southwest Machinery Industry Administration, which emphasized heavy production tasks and production reform tasks, and was unwilling to transfer people. However, because the Southwest Industrial Department insisted on the transfer decision and criticized the bureau's departmentalism, the bureau finally transferred people.

In the transfer process, all units conscientiously implemented the principle of "transferring the best, not the worst, and transferring the leaders, not the followers." After receiving the instructions to transfer people, the Southwest Iron and Steel Industry Administration immediately studied the personnel situation of various factories and mines, ranked the personnel, and then registered the best personnel in various factories and mines for transfer, successfully transferring more than 50 people at one time.

After transferring personnel, all units quickly promoted a large number of new cadres and workers, ensuring that production continued as usual. All units also formulated plans for training cadres and universally promoted the signing of apprenticeship contracts for teaching and learning. Many factories and mines also opened a large number of technical training classes to actively train technical workers.

### 西南抽调优秀技术人材支援全国基本建设

    西南抽调优秀技术人材支援全国基本建设
    【新华社重庆九日电】西南区已先后调出优秀的技术工人、技术人员和行政管理干部共七百多人支援全国各地基本建设。其中有厂长、工程师以上干部近百人。为了服从全国重点建设中的需要，西南区不仅抽出了大批熟练的技术人员，并且抽出了西南各厂矿中本来就很缺少的一些优秀的热处理工、砌炉工、起重工等技工。
    在抽调中，西南工业部、各工业管理局、各厂矿领导干部都十分重视这一工作，并亲自领导这一工作的进行，因而保证了抽调工作顺利迅速完成。为使各级干部明了抽调人员的重大意义，西南工业部曾几次召开各工业管理局局长会议和人事工作人员会议，反复强调指出支援全国基本建设的整体观念的重要；对坚决服从抽调的单位进行了表扬，对于重视不够和拖延的单位，指定限期完成抽调工作。在抽调中，也有个别单位有本位主义思想，如西南机械工业管理局强调生产任务大、生产改革任务重，不愿抽人。但是，由于西南工业部坚持了抽调的决定，批判了该局的本位主义思想，该局终于调出人来。
    在抽调中，各单位都认真贯彻了“抽优不抽劣，抽头不抽尾”的原则。西南钢铁工业管理局在接到调人的指示后，立即研究各厂矿人员情况，进行人员排队，然后登记抽调各厂矿中最好的人员，一次就顺利调出五十多人。
    各单位在抽调人员后，都迅速提拔了大批新的干部和工人，保证了生产照常进行。各单位并订出培养干部的计划，普遍推行订立包教包学的师徒合同。许多厂矿又大量开办技术训练班，积极培养技术工人。
