    The People's Bank of China, Gyantse Branch Established
    The Gyantse Branch of the People's Bank of China was formally established on the 2nd of this month. In the future, the bank will unite local private industry and commerce to jointly strive for the development of local agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry and commerce.
    Gyantse is the center of woolen handicraft production in Tibet, and its carpets, pulu and other products are famous throughout Tibet. In the past, it gradually declined due to imperialist economic aggression. During the preparation period, the Gyantse Branch of the People's Bank provided loans and orders to support the development of Gyantse's handicraft industry, helping handicraft workers overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds, and was warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people.

    中国人民银行江孜支行成立
    中国人民银行江孜支行于本月二日正式成立。该行今后将要团结当地私营工商业，共同为发展当地的农、牧业和工商业而努力。
    江孜是西藏毛织手工业生产的中心，所产地毯、氆氇等产品闻名全藏。过去因受帝国主义的经济侵略，以致日渐衰落。人民银行江孜支行在筹备期间，曾以贷款、订货等方式，扶助江孜手工业的发展，帮助手工业者克服了资金不足的困难，受到藏族人民的热烈欢迎。
