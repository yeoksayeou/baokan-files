International Briefs

The Prearranged Future of US Soldiers Invading Korea

	An Associated Press reporter dispatched a telegram from the western part of the Korean central front in 1952, reporting: On New Year's Eve, Army Chaplain Field, knowing that three American soldiers had been killed on patrol, said, "Others will die. We hope they don't die, but we know they will."
	This is the fate of the US soldiers invading Korea.

American Thugs and Senators

	American Senator and Chairman of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, McCarran, recently became more famous as America's "Number One Special Agent" after being a defendant in court. The reason was that the "Sun" revealed his privacy, and he planned to send thugs to destroy the newspaper office. Faced with undeniable facts, McCarran had nowhere to escape and had to make some interesting confessions in court. He admitted that he was supported by casino bosses and lived for a long period in hotels opened by gangster syndicates without paying a penny. To show his "gratitude," he requested many senators to reduce the taxes of casino bosses.
	Of course, there are many things about McCarran that have not been revealed. Because the gangster syndicates would never have given him just a bottle of whiskey for such a major contribution. But this incident vividly exposes the darkness and ugliness of American politics.

British People Are Unwilling to Engage in War Preparations

	The British government has repeatedly mobilized the British people to participate in the so-called "civil defense" work. A recent Associated Press dispatch from London, talking about this work, said: "The civil defense situation in England, Wales, and Scotland is very bad. People pay too little attention to this work, and the delays are very serious." The Associated Press report said that two years ago, the British government stipulated that 66,000 firefighters be recruited for so-called "civil defense," but only 13,900 have signed up so far. The Associated Press report also said: "The situation in Scotland is even worse. England and Wales have not reached half of their target in various civil defense works, while Scotland has only achieved 37 percent."
	This not only shows that the British people are unwilling to engage in any war preparations, but also proves that the purpose of the British government's so-called "civil defense" work is not "defense" but preparing for a war of aggression.

    国际简讯
    侵朝美军士兵的被安排好的前途
    美联社记者一九五二年从朝鲜中线西部发出的电讯报道：在大除夕，军队牧师菲尔德知道有三个美国兵在巡逻时被打死后，牧师说：“还有别的人要死去。我们希望他们不致于死，但是我们知道他们是会死的。”
    这就是侵朝美军士兵的命运。
    美国的流氓和参议员
    美国参议员兼参议院国内安全小组委员会主席麦卡伦最近因在法院当了一次被告，而使他这个美国的“天字第一号特务”更为有名了。原因是“太阳报”揭露了他的隐私，他就打算发动流氓去捣毁这个报社。由于无可置辩的事实逼得麦卡伦无路可逃，他不得不在法院作一些有趣的供认。他承认他受赌场老板们的供养，并且在流氓帮会开设的旅馆住了一段很长的时期，而没有付过一文钱。为了表示“感谢”起见，他曾请求许多参议员削减赌场老板的捐税。
    当然麦卡伦还有许多事情没有被揭发出来。因为流氓帮会为了酬劳麦卡伦的这样重大的功绩，所给他的绝不会只是一瓶威士忌酒而已。可是这件事情却维妙维肖地把美国政治中的黑暗与丑恶揭发出来了。
    英国人民不愿从事备战工作
    英国政府曾一再发动英国人民参加所谓“民间防务”工作。美联社最近从伦敦发出的一条消息中谈到这个工作时说：“英格兰、威尔士和苏格兰三岛的民间防务情形很不好，人们对这种工作太不注意，拖延的情况非常严重。”美联社的这条消息说：两年前英政府曾规定为所谓“民间防务”招消防队员六万六千人，但到现在报名的只有一万三千九百人。美联社的消息还说：“苏格兰的情况更坏。英格兰和威尔士在各种民间防务工作中尚未达到目标的一半，而苏格兰只实现了百分之三十七。”
    这不仅说明英国人民不愿意从事任何备战工作，也证明了英国政府所谓“民间防务”工作的目的不是“防御”，而是准备侵略战争。
