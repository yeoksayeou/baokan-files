Technical Education Begins in Some Winter Training Classes in Taiyuan and Other Places
Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company Withdraws Winter Training Cadres, Affecting the Progress of Technical Education
The winter training work for basic construction workers in various construction units in Taiyuan City, Zhangjiakou City People's Construction Company, the First Engineering Department of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Construction Engineering Company, and the Fifth Engineering Department of Harbin, has successively entered the technical education stage.

The technical education in the aforementioned units is being conducted on the basis of political education. After political education, the workers participating in winter training have mostly overcome the free, undisciplined, conservative, and backward thinking, overcome regionalism, initially recognized the consistency between national interests and individual interests, recognized the importance of basic construction and the future of basic construction workers, and established the idea of being a worker for the long term. This has laid a certain ideological foundation for carrying out technical education. Veteran technical workers of the Taiyuan City Construction Enterprise Company proposed: "Guarantee that one person will bring two apprentices, and build the motherland well!"

The purpose of technical education is to universally improve the technical level of workers. The teaching content focuses on various advanced operational experiences, while also combining the teaching of various operating procedures and quality standards. The First Engineering Department of the Heavy Industry Ministry's Construction Engineering Company also uses some time to teach blueprint reading (mainly for veteran technicians), assembly line operations, the responsibility system, and economic accounting system.

All units have adopted practical teaching methods. For example, the First Engineering Department of the Heavy Industry Ministry's Construction Engineering Company divides workers into teams according to the nature of their work, establishes a teaching group for each team, equips each group with certain technical cadres as teachers, and equips certain construction workers as teaching assistants; for general technical workers, it adopts a teaching method based on classroom lectures and group discussions, combined with operational demonstrations; for apprentices, it focuses on operational practice. In addition to unified lectures by trade, Taiyuan Construction Enterprise Company organizes technical guidance groups mainly composed of veteran technical workers. Workers carry out a mutual teaching and learning movement in groups. Sixth-grade workers guarantee to teach fifth-grade workers, and fifth-grade workers guarantee to teach fourth-grade workers. In this way, every technician is a student and a tutor, thus strengthening the guidance force of technical education.

In order to strengthen the political and ideological leadership in technical education, the Taiyuan City Construction Enterprise Company and the Zhangjiakou City People's Construction Company have also called on political work cadres who do not understand technology to do a good job in political work on the one hand, and to humbly learn from technical personnel and technical workers on the other, so that they can gradually become experts in the construction industry.

Furthermore, the Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company withdrew the cadres leading the workers' winter training class to the company to participate in business studies, which left the winter training class in a state of no leadership in technical education and affected the completion of the technical education plan.

After the company's workers' winter training class switched to technical study on January 9, under the direct leadership of the General Company's Winter Training Committee, it promptly corrected the leadership cadres' tendencies of mutual dependence and slackness, and relied on veteran technical workers to improve teaching methods and strengthen guidance. However, just as the workers' enthusiasm for learning was high, the company, in order to allow cadres to participate in business studies, withdrew many capable cadres who directly led the winter training class without careful planning, and relaxed the leadership of technical education. On January 18, the company transferred the two main responsible cadres of the Winter Training Committee to other work and decided to have the political instructor of the Second Team replace them. As a result, other cadres were affected and developed a sense of relief, with some saying, "The main responsible cadres have left, winter training is not important anymore." On January 22, the company's Labor Organization Section transferred many cadres responsible for leading technical studies back to the company for study. The Third Team previously had twelve technical instructors, now only two with poor technical skills are left. After this transfer, the emotions of the remaining cadres fluctuated. Most of the cadres and instructors of the Seventh Team heard that they would return to the company to study and did not go to the groups. There were no instructors to lead the group discussion during the discussion time on the afternoon of the 23rd; no one organized mutual teaching and learning during the carpentry trainees' practice; in nine out of the thirteen bricklaying groups, some trainees were sleeping, playing chess, or playing billiards.

The Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company should immediately take effective measures to correct the above situation. (Ren Feng)

    太原等地部分冬训班开始进行技术教育
    太原市建筑工程公司抽走冬训干部影响技术教育的进行
    太原市各建筑单位、张家口市人民建筑公司、中央重工业部建设工程公司第一工程处和哈尔滨第五工程处等单位的基本建设工人冬季训练工作，已经先后进入技术教育阶段。
    上述单位的技术教育是在政治教育的基础上进行的。经过政治教育以后，参加冬季训练的工人，大都初步克服了自由散漫保守落后的思想，克服了地域观念，初步认识了国家利益与个人利益的一致性，认识了基本建设的重要和基本建设工人的前途，树立了长期当工人的思想。这就给进行技术教育打下了一定的思想基础。太原市建筑企业公司的老技术工人提出：“保证一人带两个徒弟，好好建设祖国！”
    技术教育的目的是把工人技术水平普遍提高一步。教学内容以各种先进操作经验为主，同时结合着讲授各种操作规程和质量标准。重工业部建设工程公司第一工程处还以一部分时间讲授看图纸（主要对象是老技工）、流水作业、责任制和经济核算制等问题。
    各单位都采取了切合实际的教学方法。如重工业部建设工程公司第一工程处把工人按照工种性质分队，每队成立教学组，每组配备一定的技术干部当教员，配备一定的施工员为教学辅导员；对一般技术工人采取课堂讲授、小组讨论为主并结合操作表演的教学方法；对徒工则着重操作实习。太原建筑企业公司除以工种为单位统一讲课外，以老技术工人为主组织技术辅导组。工人以小组为单位，开展互教互学运动，六级工人保证教五级工人，五级工人又保证教四级工人。这样，每一个技工都是学生，又是辅导员，因而加强了技术教育的辅导力量。
    太原市建筑企业公司和张家口市人民建筑公司为了加强技术教育中的政治思想领导，还号召不懂得技术的政治工作干部，一方面做好政治工作，一方面虚心向技术人员和技术工人学习，使自己逐渐成为建筑业的内行和专家。
    又讯：太原市建筑工程公司把领导工人冬季训练班的干部抽回公司参加业务学习，使冬训班技术教育陷于无人领导的状态，影响了技术教育计划的完成。
    该公司工人冬训班于一月九日转入技术学习后，在总公司冬训委员会直接领导下，曾及时纠正了领导干部互相依赖和松劲的偏向，并依靠老技术工人改进了教学方法，加强了辅导力量。但正当工人学习情绪高涨的时候，该公司为了让干部参加业务学习，没有周密计划就把直接领导冬训班的许多得力干部抽回去，放松了技术教育的领导。一月十八日，该公司把冬训委员会两个主要负责干部调去作其他工作，决定由第二队政治指导员代替他们。因此，影响其他干部产生了松一口气的情绪，如有的人说：“主要负责干部都走了，冬训不要紧了。”一月二十二日，该公司劳动组织科又把许多负责领导技术学习的干部调回公司学习。三中队以前有十二个技术辅导员，现在仅留下技术能力较差的两个人。这样调动后，留下来的干部情绪就波动起来。七中队大部分干部和辅导员听说将回公司学习，就不到小组里去了。二十三日下午的讨论时间就没有辅导员去领导小组讨论；木工学员作实习也没有人组织互教互学；十三个瓦工小组中有九个小组有部分学员睡觉、下象棋或打康乐球。
    太原市建筑工程公司应即采取有效措施纠正上述情况。　（任峰）
