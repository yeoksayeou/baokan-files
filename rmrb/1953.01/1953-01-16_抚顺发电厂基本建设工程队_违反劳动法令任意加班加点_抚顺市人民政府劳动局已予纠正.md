To the Editors:

    The Fushun Power Plant Basic Construction Engineering Team in Northeast China arbitrarily requires workers to work overtime, seriously affecting their health. I suggest that the Fushun Municipal Labor Bureau quickly correct this situation.

    In May of last year, the Northeast People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Restricting Overtime Work in Factories and Mines," which stipulates that, except for urgent national defense tasks, employees "should not work more than two hours of overtime per day," and "the total amount of overtime per month should not exceed forty-eight hours." This regulation is extremely supported by all workers in Northeast China. However, our team leaders have a very serious, purely task-oriented perspective, so the phenomenon of workers working overtime is still very serious. In May, June, and July of last year, many people worked a total of sixty to seventy hours of overtime per month. Some workers at the boiler construction site worked a total of more than one hundred hours of overtime in July. Even more frightening is that in June, individual workers in the dispatch section worked a total of thirty-two shifts of overtime, which is six and a half shifts more than the monthly basic working days (the average working day in Northeast China is stipulated as twenty-five and a half days per month). Although the situation has improved slightly since August, it is still common for people to work fifty to sixty hours of overtime each month. If this situation is not corrected in time, the health and work of the workers will be damaged. I hope the Fushun Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau will deal with it promptly.

            A Worker from the Fushun Power Plant Basic Construction Engineering Team

    Editor's Note: The issue raised by a worker from the Fushun Power Plant Basic Construction Engineering Team, which we forwarded to the Fushun Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau for investigation, has been proven to be true. Relevant leaders at all levels of the Fushun Power Plant Basic Construction Engineering Team have made self-criticisms and promised to earnestly implement labor laws in the future. According to our understanding, the phenomenon of excessive overtime work for employees in basic construction work is indeed not isolated. With the increasing number of construction projects in various places in the future, the practice of appropriately restricting overtime work will be even more necessary. Therefore, we are publishing the letter from a worker of the Fushun Power Plant Basic Construction Engineering Team here for the attention of labor authorities in various regions.

### 抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队  违反劳动法令任意加班加点  抚顺市人民政府劳动局已予纠正

    抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队
    违反劳动法令任意加班加点
    抚顺市人民政府劳动局已予纠正
    编辑同志：东北抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队任意让工人加班加点，严重影响工人健康；建议抚顺市劳动局迅速纠正这种情况。
    去年五月间，东北人民政府曾颁布“关于限制工厂矿场加班加点的暂行规定”，除因国防紧急任务外，职工“每日加点最多不得超过两小时”，“全月加班加点总数，不得超过四十八小时”。这个规定是全东北工人所极端拥护的。但我队领导干部单纯任务观点很严重，所以工人加班加点现象仍然非常严重。去年五、六、七三个月，全月加班加点总数达六、七十小时的人很多。锅炉工地某些工人七月全月加班加点总数竟在一百小时以上。更可怕的是六月份调度股个别工人加班加点总数竟达三十二个工，比每月基本工作日还多六个半工（东北规定每月工作日平均为二十五天半）。八月份起，情况虽然好一点了，但是每月加班加点五、六十小时的情况还是很普遍的。这种情况如果不及时纠正，工人的健康和工作都将受到损失。希望抚顺市人民政府劳动局迅速进行处理。
            抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队一职工
    编者按：抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队一职工来信提出的问题，经我们转请抚顺市人民政府劳动局调查，证明情况属实。抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队各级有关领导干部都已作了检讨，并保证今后一定认真执行劳动法令。据我们了解，基本建设工作的职工加班加点过多的现象的确不是个别的。今后各地建筑工程任务日益增多，适当限制加班加点的做法就更为必要。因此，我们把抚顺发电厂基本建设工程队一职工的信发表在这里，请各地劳动机关注意。
