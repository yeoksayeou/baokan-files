TASS dispatch: "Pravda" editorial
    TASS announced today the arrest of a group of doctors-saboteurs. Some time ago, the state security organs cracked a terrorist group whose aim was to shorten the lives of Soviet activists through health-damaging treatment. After interrogation, it has been determined that the members of this group, using their positions as doctors and abusing the trust of patients, deliberately and maliciously damaged the health of patients, made incorrect diagnoses, and then killed the patients with incorrect treatments. These thugs and murderers trampled the sacred banner of science under the guise of the noble and lofty title of doctor-scientist. After embarking on the path of heinous crimes, they disgraced the honor of scientists. Comrades A.A. Zhdanov and A.S. Shcherbakov were victims of this gang of human-faced beasts. The criminals confessed that they took advantage of the opportunity to treat Comrade Zhdanov, deliberately concealing his myocardial infarction, prescribing a prescription that was detrimental to this serious illness, thus killing Comrade Zhdanov. The doctor-murderers incorrectly applied potent drugs and prescribed a harmful prescription, shortening the life of Comrade Shcherbakov, causing his death.
    The criminals first attempted to damage the health of Soviet military leaders, rendering them unable to work, thereby weakening the country's defense capabilities. However, the arrest of the criminals foiled their malicious plans and prevented them from achieving their sinister goals.
    Who do these thugs serve? Who directs these despicable traitors of the motherland in their criminal terror and sabotage activities? What goals do they want to achieve by murdering activists of the Soviet state?
    It has been determined that all members of this doctor terrorist group served foreign intelligence agencies, selling their souls and bodies, and becoming agents employed and supported by foreign intelligence agencies.
    Most members of this terrorist group (M.S. Vovsi, B.B. Kogan, A.I. Feldman, A.M. Grinstein, E.G. Etinger, etc.) were bought by American intelligence agencies. They were recruited by a branch of the American intelligence agencies - the international Jewish bourgeois nationalist organization "Joint" (Jewish Joint Relief Committee, the same below). The dirty face of this "Zionist" organization, which engages in despicable activities under the guise of charity and espionage, has been thoroughly exposed.
    These professional spies and terrorists of the "Joint" organization, relying on a group of degenerate Jewish bourgeois nationalists, carried out their subversive activities in Soviet territory according to the tasks instructed by the American intelligence agencies and under its leadership. As the arrested Vovsi confessed during interrogation, he received instructions from the United States to "murder the lives of Soviet leaders." This instruction was conveyed to him by Dr. Shimeliovich and the famous Jewish bourgeois nationalist Mikhoels on behalf of the espionage terrorist organization "Joint".
    The cracking of the doctor-poisoner gang is a blow to the international "Zionist" organization. Now, everyone can see what kind of people the "philanthropists" and "friends of peace" hiding behind the signboard of the "Joint" organization are.
    It has now been determined that the other members of this terrorist group (V.N. Vinogradov, M.B. Kogan, P.I. Yegorov) are veteran agents of the British intelligence agencies, who have long served the British intelligence agencies and carried out its most criminal and despicable tasks. The American rulers and their British "partners" know that it is impossible to achieve domination over other countries by peaceful means. They are frantically preparing for another world war, so they are stepping up the dispatch of spies to the rear of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and want to accomplish what the Hitler bandit gang failed to do—to establish their "fifth column" in the Soviet Union to engage in subversive activities. It is enough to mention that the US government openly and shamelessly allocated 100 million US dollars for subversive, terrorist and espionage activities in the countries of the socialist camp, not to mention the billions of US dollars that the United States and Britain secretly use for this purpose.
    The Soviet people should never forget that they must do their best to improve their vigilance, vigilantly guard against all conspiracies of the warmongers and their agents, and tirelessly strengthen the armed forces and intelligence agencies of our country. Comrade Stalin has reminded us more than once that our achievements also have a dark side, and these achievements have made many of our staff complacent and careless. This emotion has not been overcome yet. There are still quite a few careless people. It is precisely this carelessness of our people that constitutes the soil suitable for others to carry out malicious sabotage.
    In the Soviet Union, socialist relations occupy a comprehensive and dominant position. The Soviet people have achieved unprecedented victories in the Great Patriotic War. The serious wounds of war have been restored in an unprecedentedly short period of time. We have made achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural construction. Due to these facts, some people have come to the conclusion that there is no longer any danger of sabotage, subversion, and espionage, and that the rulers of the capitalist world may abandon their attempts to subvert the Soviet Union. However, those who hold this idea and this argument can only be those right-leaning opportunists who hold the anti-Marxist view that the class struggle is "extinguished." They do not understand, or cannot understand, that our success will not extinguish the struggle, but will sharpen the struggle. The more smoothly we develop forward, the more intense the struggle of the enemies of the people who are doomed to perish and are in despair. The immortal Lenin taught this, and Comrade Stalin also taught this. Lenin pointed out: "Our revolution has confirmed more than any other revolution that the strength of the revolution, the strength of the offensive, the energy, determination, and victory of the revolution simultaneously strengthen the resistance of the bourgeoisie."
    When exposing the opportunist theory that the class struggle also "extinguishes" with our victory, Comrade Stalin warned:
    "This is not only a decadent theory, but also a dangerous theory, because it paralyzes our people, leads them into a trap, and allows the class enemies to reorganize and fight against the Soviet regime." The exploiting classes have long been defeated and eliminated in the Soviet Union, but there are still remnants of bourgeois ideology, remnants of private psychology and morality, and there are still hidden living enemies of the people who spread bourgeois views and bourgeois morality. It is these hidden enemies supported by the imperialist world who will continue to do evil. All this requires the Soviet people to do their best to improve their revolutionary vigilance and pay vigilant attention to the enemy's conspiracies. The fact that a despicable bunch of "scientific personnel" can operate with impunity for a period of time shows that some of our Soviet organs and their leaders have lost their vigilance and have been infected with carelessness. The state security organs did not promptly crack down on this sabotage terrorist organization among doctors. These organs should have been particularly vigilant, because there have been such examples in history. For example, despicable murderers and traitors like Levin and Pletnev "doctors" carried out activities under the guise of doctors. According to the tasks instructed by the enemies of the Soviet Union, they deliberately killed the great Russian writer Gorky, the outstanding activist of the Soviet state Kuibyshev, and V.R. Manzhinsky, with incorrect treatment. The leaders of the Soviet Ministry of Health also failed to fulfill their responsibilities. They did not see the sabotage and terrorist activities of the despicable degenerates who sold themselves to the enemies of the Soviet Union.
    The cracking of the doctor-poisoner gang is a fatal blow to the American and British warmongers. Their spy agencies have been cracked and are unable to do harm. The true face of the American and British slave owners and cannibals has once again been revealed to the world. The Soviet people angrily and indignantly condemn the criminal gang of murderers and their foreign masters. The Soviet people suppress the humble lackeys who sell themselves for dollars and pounds like hateful pests. As for the instigators of these murderous lackeys, they can believe that they cannot escape punishment and will be held accountable one day. All this is of course correct. However, there is another thing that is equally correct: besides these enemies, we also have an enemy, and that is the carelessness of our people. There is no doubt that as long as carelessness exists here, sabotage will also exist. Therefore, to eliminate sabotage, we must eliminate carelessness in our ranks.

    披着教授与医生外衣的卑鄙的间谍和杀人犯
  　苏联“真理报”社论
    塔斯社今天发表了关于逮捕一批医生—破坏者的消息。若干时以前，国家保安机关破获了一个恐怖集团，这个集团的目的就是以有损健康的治疗来缩短苏联活动家的生命。经过讯问，已经确定：这个集团的成员利用他们的医生地位并妄用病人的信任，处心积虑地、恶毒地毁坏病人的健康，给他们作出不正确的诊断，然后以不正确的治疗杀死病人。这些暴徒和杀人犯在医生—科学人员这一高尚崇高的称号掩饰下践踏了神圣的科学旗帜。他们走上滔天罪行的道路之后，就玷辱了科学家的荣誉。安·亚·日丹诺夫和亚·塞·谢尔巴科夫同志成了这帮人面野兽匪帮的牺牲者。罪犯们供认，他们曾利用为日丹诺夫同志诊病的机会，故意隐瞒他所患的心肌梗塞症，开了一个对这种重病不利的处方，从而害死了日丹诺夫同志。医生—杀人犯不正确地应用烈性药剂，开了一个有害的处方，缩短了谢尔巴科夫同志的生命，引起了他的死亡。
    罪犯们首先企图毁坏苏联军事领导干部们的健康，使他们失去工作能力，从而削弱国家的防御能力。但是罪犯们的被捕使他们的恶毒计划遭到失败，使他们无法达到他们的罪恶目的。
    这些暴徒是为谁服务呢？是谁指导着这些祖国的卑鄙叛徒们进行罪恶的恐怖和破坏活动呢？他们杀害苏维埃国家的活动家想达到怎样的目的呢？
    已经确定：这个医生恐怖集团的全体成员都是为外国情报机关服务的，出卖了他们的灵魂和肉体，当了外国情报机关雇佣和豢养的特务。
    这个恐怖集团的大多数成员（麦·斯·沃夫西，勃·勃·科甘，阿·伊·费德曼，阿·麦·格林希坦因，叶·格·艾丁格尔等）都被美国情报机关收买了。他们被美国情报机关的分号——国际犹太资产阶级民族主义者组织“联合”（犹太联合救济委员会，下同）组织招募去了。这个披着慈善外衣从事卑鄙活动的间谍“犹太复国主义”组织的肮脏面貌给彻底揭露了。
    这些“联合”组织的职业间谍和恐怖分子依靠着一批堕落的犹太资产阶级民族主义者，根据美国情报机关指示的任务并在它的领导下，也在苏联领土上展开了他们的颠复活动。如被捕的沃夫西在讯问时所供认，他从美国得到“谋害苏联领导干部的生命”的指示。这一指示是医生希麦里奥维奇和著名的犹太资产阶级民族主义者米贺耶尔斯代表间谍恐怖组织“联合”组织转给他的。
    医生—施毒犯匪帮的破获是对国际“犹太复国主义”组织的一个打击。现在，所有的人都可以看到躲在“联合”组织招牌后面的“慈善家”与“和平友人”是些什么样的人。
    这个恐怖集团的其他成员（维·恩·维诺格拉多夫，麦·勃·科甘，普·伊·叶高罗夫）现在已经确定就是英国情报机关的老牌特务，老早就一直为英国情报机关服务，执行着它的最罪恶的和卑鄙的任务。美国统治者和他们的英国“小伙计”知道不可能用和平手段取得对其他国家的统治。他们疯狂地准备另一次世界大战，因此加紧把特务派到苏联和人民民主国家的后方，并想完成希特勒匪帮没有做到的事——在苏联建立他们从事颠复活动的“第五纵队”。美国政府公然无耻地拨款一亿美元用于在社会主义阵营的国家从事颠复、恐怖和间谍活动，只消提一提这件事就够了，且不说美国和英国偷偷摸摸用于这个目的的成亿成亿的美元了。
    苏维埃人民一刻也不应忘记必须尽力提高自己的警惕性，警觉地提防战争贩子和他们的特务的一切阴谋，不倦地加强我们国家的武装力量和情报机关。斯大林同志不止一次地提醒我们说，我们的成就也有着阴暗的方面，这些成就使我们许多工作人员产生了自满自足、漫不经心的情绪。这种情绪还远没有克服。马马虎虎的人为数还不少。正是我们的人的这种马马虎虎的作风构成了适于别人进行恶毒破坏的土壤。
    在苏联，社会主义关系占着全面的统治地位。苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争中取得了史无前例的胜利。在空前短的时间内就恢复了严重的战争创伤。在经济和文化建设的各个方面我们都作出了成绩。由于这些事实，一些人就得出结论：现在已经没有破坏、颠覆和间谍活动的危险了，资本主义世界的统治者可能放弃他们进行颠复苏联的活动的企图。然而作这种想法和有这种论调的只能是那些右倾机会主义者，那些持阶级斗争“熄灭”这种反马克思主义观点的人。他们不明白，或者不能明白：我们的成功不会使斗争熄灭，而会使斗争尖锐，我们向前发展得越是顺利，那么注定灭亡的、陷于绝望的人民之敌的斗争就越加激烈。不朽的列宁这么教导着，斯大林同志也这么教导着。列宁指出：“我们的革命比任何其他的革命都更加证实了：革命的力量，进攻的力量，精力，决心和革命的胜利同时加强着资产阶级方面的反抗力。”
    斯大林同志在揭露机会主义的关于随着我们的胜利阶级斗争也跟着“熄灭”这种理论时警告说：
    “这不仅是一种腐朽的理论，而且也是一种危险的理论，因为它麻痹我们的人，把他们引入陷井，而让阶级敌人能重整旗鼓作反对苏维埃政权的斗争。”剥削阶级在苏联早已被击溃和消灭了，但是仍然有着资产阶级思想的残余、私有心理和道德的残余，仍然有着资产阶级观点和资产阶级道德的传播者这些暗藏的活的人民之敌。正是这些帝国主义世界所支持的暗藏的敌人将来还会为非作歹。这一切使苏联人民必须尽力提高革命警惕性，警觉地注意敌人的阴谋。一批“科学人员”的卑鄙败类能在若干时间内不受惩罚地活动，这说明我们苏联的一些机关和它们的领导者失去警惕性，感染了马马虎虎的作风。国家保安机关没有及时在医生中间破获这种破坏恐怖组织。而这些机关本应该是特别警惕的，因为历史上已经有过这种例子，例如，像列文、普列特湼夫“医生”这些卑鄙的杀人犯和卖国贼就是披着医生的外衣进行活动，他们根据苏联敌人指示的任务，故意用不正确的治疗害死了伟大的俄罗斯作家高尔基，苏维埃国家出色的活动家古比雪夫和维·尔·曼仁斯基。苏联卫生部的领导者也没有尽到职责。他们竟没有看出卖身给苏联敌人的卑鄙败类的破坏恐怖活动。
    医生—施毒犯匪帮的破获是对美英战争贩子一个致命的打击。他们的特务机关被破获了，无能为害了。美国和英国的奴隶主与吃人野兽的真面目再一次显露在全世界的面前。苏联人民忿怒与愤慨地谴责罪恶的杀人匪帮和他们的外国主子。苏联人民像对待可恶的蟊虫一样，镇压着为美元和英镑而出卖自己的卑贱走狗。至于说到这些杀人走狗的教唆者，他们可以相信：他们是逃不脱惩罚的，总有一天跟他们算账的。这一切当然是对的。不过，还有一点同样也是对的：就是除了这些敌人以外，我们还有一种敌人，这就是我们的人的马马虎虎作风。不用怀疑，只要马马虎虎的作风在我们这里存在一天，那么破坏行为也就会存在。因此，要消灭破坏行为，就得铲除我们队伍中的马马虎虎作风。
