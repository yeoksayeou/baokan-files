    People's Volunteer Army Soldier Cui Xianjiang's Letter to Qi Yue of the Central People's Broadcasting Station
    Dear Comrade Qi Yue: Although I have never met you, your name is familiar to me. Your voice is my favorite and one I hear often. Far away from the motherland, how much I want to know everything about it! You are the one who often introduces us to the situation in the motherland. Of course, we love you. Although the fighting here is frequent and the work is intense, we still make time every night to cross a hill and run to the radio operator to listen to news from the motherland. After listening, we should rest, but we are always excitedly talking about the present of the motherland and thinking about the bright future of the motherland. All this encourages me to fight bravely.
    When we achieved a major victory in the Battle of Shangganling, the people of the motherland sent a慰问团 (comfort mission), bringing us many慰问品 (gifts of comfort) and the hearts of the people of the motherland who love the Volunteer Army. These made us very excited. We have nothing else but to fight more bravely, annihilate more enemies, and strive for the complete victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, to answer Chairman Mao and the concern of the people of the motherland.
    A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Cui Xianjiang

    人民志愿军崔鲜疆给中央人民广播电台齐越的信
    亲爱的齐越同志：我和你虽然没有见过面，可是，你的名字是我所熟悉的。你的声音是我最喜欢而又经常听到的。远离祖国的我，是多么想了解祖国的一切啊！你就是经常给我们介绍祖国情况的人。我们当然热爱你。我们这里虽然战斗是频繁的，工作是紧张的，但我们每晚都要挤出时间来，翻过一个山岗，跑到收音员那里，听听来自祖国的消息。听完之后，应该休息了，可是我们总是兴奋地谈着祖国的现在，想着祖国美好的将来，这一切都鼓舞着我勇敢地战斗下去。
    当我们在上甘岭战斗中取得了重大胜利的时候，祖国人民派来了慰问团，给我们带来了很多慰问品，带来了祖国人民热爱志愿军的心。这些都使我们太激动了。我们没有别的，只有更加勇敢地战斗，歼灭更多的敌人，争取抗美援朝的彻底胜利，来回答毛主席和祖国人民的关怀。
    中国人民志愿军某部  崔鲜疆
