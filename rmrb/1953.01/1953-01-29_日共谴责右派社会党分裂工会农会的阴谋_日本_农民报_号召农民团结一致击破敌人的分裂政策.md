Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: In view of the increasing unity and strength of the Japanese working class in the struggle against the revival of militarism and against low wages, the American and Japanese reactionaries, under the instruction of right-wing Socialist Party splitters, are carrying out shameful splitting activities against Japan's largest trade union organization, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo"), in an attempt to sabotage the unity of the Japanese working class from within and organize puppet trade union organizations.

In the autumn of 1952, Japanese trade unions, mainly the Electrical Industry Workers' Union and the Coal Miners' Union belonging to "Sohyo," launched a large-scale and long-term strike struggle. In the strike struggle, the Japanese working class demonstrated their spirit of unity, and some trade unions that did not belong to "Sohyo" joined "Sohyo," strengthening the united front of the Japanese working class. Under these circumstances, the American and Japanese reactionaries increasingly felt the need to destroy "Sohyo" from within, weaken the unity of the Japanese working class, and clear the way for them to pursue their enslavement policies. The so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" representative in Japan, the American Federation of Labor Executive Committee member, Tangson, and the Japanese Ministry of Labor designated right-wing socialists who controlled the National Federation of Textile Industry Workers' Unions, the All-Japan Seamen's Union, the Japan Broadcasting Labor Union, and the National Federation of Film and Theater Workers' Unions to carry out this shameful task. At the end of last year, these four trade unions belonging to "Sohyo" jointly issued a statement, wantonly attacking "Sohyo's" leadership policy. On January 11 this year, they openly announced that they would launch a "movement" to "organize a front against the General Council of Trade Unions." At the same time, they also openly colluded with the Japanese Confederation of Labor directly controlled by the right-wing Socialist Party to organize the so-called "National Liaison Council for Democratic Labor Movement" to engage in activities against "Sohyo."

The splitting behavior of the right-wing Socialist Party exposed their ugly faces. The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on January 13, condemning the splitting activities of the National Federation of Textile Industry Workers' Unions and other four trade unions, and pointed out that the purpose of this splitting activity was to facilitate the implementation of the policies of the Japanese reactionaries who have close ties with the United States. The statement also announced that the Japanese Communist Party supports the "Sohyo" headquarters in opposing this betrayal. On the 14th, the left-wing Socialist Party also issued a statement condemning the collusion of these four trade unions and right-wing socialists with the Yoshida government and capitalists in a conspiracy to split "Sohyo." At the same time, many trade unions expressed their opposition to the splitting activities and demanded strengthening unity.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th: TASS dispatch: According to Tokyo news, the leaders of the Japanese right-wing Socialist Party have taken a step to split the peasant movement. On January 21, they established a so-called General Federation of Farmers' Unions to confront the left wing of the Japan Farmers' Association. This newly established alliance includes farmer organizations controlled by right-wing socialists, such as the National Farmers' Association, the National Farmers' League, and the right wing of the Japan Farmers' Association.

Japanese democrats pointed out: The right-wing socialists' establishment of the General Federation of Farmers' Unions is to undermine the unity of the broad masses of Japanese farmers in their struggle for land, democratic rights, and national independence.

It must be pointed out that the growing strength of the Japanese people's resistance to American occupation and opposition to the Yoshida government's traitorous policy has caused serious confusion in the reactionary camp.

Since the police suppression has failed to break this resistance, the American occupiers and the Japanese ruling group have ordered their right-wing Socialist Party agents to try to undermine the increasingly consolidated unity of the working people from within. After creating a split within the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the right-wing Socialist Party leaders are now trying to do the same in the peasant movement.

It is worth noting that right-wing Socialist Party leaders who were previously purged from the party for engaging in militarist activities are actively participating in this splitting conspiracy.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Tokyo dispatch: Since the Sixth National Congress held in August 1952, the Japan Farmers' Association has been working hard to implement the policy of opposing militarism and feudal forces, defending the interests of laboring farmers, and strengthening unity.

On December 5 and 6, 1952, the Japan Farmers' Association convened the Second Meeting of the Central Standing Committee. The meeting resolved to demand that the general grain purchase price be raised from the current 7,500 yen per koku, which is far below the cost of production, to more than 10,000 yen, and to demand fair handling of grain purchase quotas and quality inspection of purchased grain, while allowing farmers to retain grain fees for their own use. The resolution specifically pointed out that on the issue of grain prices, farmers must unite with workers to struggle together. The meeting also decided to strengthen ties with people all over the world, further strengthen the peace movement and the struggle against military bases, and launch the Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese trade movements. The meeting also discussed the issue of the House of Councillors election and the unification of the farmers' front.

The First Meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held on October 15 and 16, 1952. This meeting affirmed the organizational policy of revolutionary peasant mass organizations that fight against landlord forces and are based on poor and hired peasants. The meeting also decided to eliminate the middle-peasantry that obscures the significance of the revolutionary land reform, based in the Johto area.

The Japan Farmers' Association's newspaper, "Farmers' Newspaper," published an editorial entitled "Smash the Splitting Conspiracy and Strive for the Unification of the Farmers' Front," calling on Japanese farmers to unite and fight against the enemy's splitting policy and the conspiracy to militarize agriculture.

    日共谴责右派社会党分裂工会农会的阴谋
    日本“农民报”号召农民团结一致击破敌人的分裂政策
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：鉴于日本工人阶级在反对军国主义复活和反对低微工资的斗争中日益团结和强大，美、日反动派指使日本右派社会党分裂分子对日本最大的工会联合组织——日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）——进行可耻的分裂活动，阴谋从内部破坏日本工人阶级的团结，组织御用的工会团体。
    一九五二年秋季，日本工会以属于“总评”的电气产业工会和煤矿工会为主力，展开了大规模的长期的罢工斗争。在罢工斗争中，日本工人阶级显示了他们的团结精神，并且有一些不属于“总评”的工会参加了“总评”，加强了日本工人阶级的统一战线。在这种情况下，美、日反动派日益感到有必要从内部来破坏“总评”，削弱日本工人阶级的团结力量，为他们推行奴役政策扫清道路。所谓“国际自由工会联合会”在日本的代表、美国产联执行委员会委员唐森和日本劳动省就指派把持着全国纤维产业工会同盟、全日本海员工会、日本广播工会、全国电影戏剧工会的右派社会党人，来执行这个可耻的任务。去年年底，这四个属于“总评”的工会联合发表声明，滥肆攻击“总评”的领导方针。今年一月十一日，他们公开宣布要发起一个“运动”，“组织反对总评议会的阵线”。同时，他们并公开和右派社会党直接控制的日本工会总同盟相互勾结，组织所谓“全国民主主义劳工运动联络协议会”，从事反对“总评”的活动。
    右派社会党的分裂行为，使他们的丑恶面目暴露出来。日本共产党在一月十三日发表声明，斥责全国纤维产业工会同盟等四个工会的分裂活动，并指出这种分裂活动的目的是要使得和美国具有密切联系的日本反动派的政策便于执行。声明并宣布，日共支持“总评”总部反对这种叛变的行为。十四日，左派社会党也发表声明谴责这四个工会和右派社会党人勾结吉田政府和资本家阴谋分裂“总评”。同时，许多工会纷纷表示反对分裂活动，要求加强团结。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社讯：据东京消息，日本右派社会党首领们采取了一个分裂农民运动的步骤。他们在一月二十一日成立了一个所谓农民组合总同盟，和日本农民协会的左派相对抗。这个新成立的同盟包括了受右派社会党人控制的农民组织，如全国农民协会、全国农民联盟和日本农民协会的右派。
    日本民主方面人士指出：右派社会党人成立农民组合总同盟是为了要破坏日本广大农民在争取土地、民主权利和国家独立的斗争中的团结。
    必须指出：日本人民反抗美国占领和反对吉田政府卖国政策的力量的日益增长，引起了反动阵营的严重混乱。
    由于警察的镇压并没有能打破这种反抗，于是美国占领者和日本统治集团就命令他们的右派社会党代理人设法从内部破坏劳动人民的日益巩固的团结。右派社会党领袖在日本工会总评议会内部制造了分裂之后，现在又要在农民运动中来这一手了。
    值得注意的是：以前因为曾从事军国主义活动而被清除出党的右派社会党首领们，正在积极参加这种分裂阴谋。
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日本农民协会在一九五二年八月间举行了第六届全国代表大会以后，正在为贯彻反对军国主义和封建势力、保卫劳动农民的利益和加强团结的方针而努力。
    一九五二年十二月五日和六日，日本农民协会召开了中央常任委员会第二次会议。会议决议要求将一般的征粮价格从现在的远低于生产成本的一日石七千五百日元提高到一万日元以上，并要求公平处理征粮摊派和被征的粮食的品质检查问题，同时要允许农民保留自用的粮费。决议特别指出，在粮食价格问题上，农民必须联合工人共同斗争。会议并决定要加强和世界各地人民的联系，进一步加强和平运动和反对军事基地化的斗争，展开日中、日苏贸易运动。会议也讨论了参议院选举问题和农民战线的统一问题。
    中央常任委员会第一次会议是在一九五二年十月十五日和十六日举行的。这一次会议肯定了和地主势力作斗争、以贫雇农为主的革命的农民群众团体的组织方针。会议并决定肃清以常东地区为据点的抹煞革命的土地改革的意义的中农主义。
    日本农民协会机关报“农民报”曾经发表题为“击破分裂阴谋，争取农民战线的统一”的社论，号召日本农民团结一致，和敌人的分裂政策和农业战时体制化的阴谋进行斗争。
