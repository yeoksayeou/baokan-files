    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: The Japanese government has openly violated international law by handing over Chinese POWs who escaped from US POW camps on Koje Island to the American aggressors. According to Kyodo News, Japanese police captured ten POWs on Tsushima Island who had escaped from the US POW camp on Koje Island. According to the Japanese newspaper "Asahi Shimbun," the Japanese police captured a total of five POWs who had escaped from Koje Island by boat and drifted to Tsushima Island. The newspaper reported that the authorities on Tsushima Island, under Japanese jurisdiction, have handed these POWs over to the United States. The Japanese government's act of handing over successfully escaped POWs to the United States is completely illegal. Article 91 of the 1949 Geneva Convention stipulates that escaped POWs should be considered to have completed their escape if they "have left the territory under the control of the detaining power or its allies." Up until now, the Japanese government has not dared to openly participate directly in the Korean War; therefore, the Japanese government is directly violating the "Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in War on Land," which it signed and recognized at the 1907 Hague Conference. Article 13 of that treaty stipulates: "A neutral power which receives prisoners of war who have escaped shall leave them at liberty; if it permits them to remain in its territory it may assign them a place of residence." This illegal act by the Japanese government completely serves the interests of American imperialism, violating the interests of the Japanese people. It fully proves that the Japanese Yoshida government is a loyal running dog of the American aggressors.

    日本政府公然破坏国际公法
    将脱逃成功的我被俘人员非法移交给美方
    【新华社二十九日讯】日本政府公然破坏国际公法，将从巨济岛美方战俘营中逃出的我方被俘人员移交给美国侵略者。据共同社报道，日本警察在对马岛捕获了十名从巨济岛美方战俘营中逃出的战俘。另据日本报纸“朝日新闻”报道，被日本警察捕获的战俘一共五名，他们是从巨济岛上乘船逃出，漂流到对马岛上去的。该报报道说，在日本管辖下的对马岛当局已经将这些战俘交给了美国方面。日本政府这种将脱逃成功的战俘交给美国方面的行为，是完全非法的。一九四九年日内瓦公约第九十一条规定，脱逃的战俘如果“已离开拘留国或其盟国所控制之领土”，就应认为脱逃已经完成。到现在为止，日本政府还没有敢明目张胆地直接参加朝鲜战争，因此，日本政府直接违犯了它在一九零七年海牙会议上签字承认的“陆战时中立国及其人民之权利义务条约”。该条约的第十三条规定：“中立国收容逃亡之战俘，应听其自由；倘准其在境内逗留，可指定其住处。”日本政府这一非法行为完全是违反日本人民的利益，来为美帝国主义的利益服务的。它充分证明日本吉田政府是美国侵略者的忠顺走卒。
