East China Transfers Cadres to Support Key National Capital Construction Areas.
Units Expedite Promotion and Training of Technical Cadres After Transferring Cadres

The East China Branch of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the East China Branch of the Machinery Industry Administration Bureau of the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry, the Shanghai Railway Administration, and the East China Textile Administration Bureau, among other units, are actively transferring technical personnel to support key national capital construction projects and to strengthen capital construction institutions in the East China region under the Central Government.

According to preliminary statistics, the East China Branch of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the East China Branch of the Machinery Industry Administration Bureau of the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry have already transferred 417 technical personnel from their affiliated factories and sent them to the Central Government in batches. Among them, the cadres transferred from the steel sector account for 70% of the total number of existing technical personnel. The Shanghai Railway Administration also transferred 100 technical personnel to the Northeast on December 24th of last year, and the East China Textile Administration Bureau has decided to transfer a complete set of 1,200 cadres from its affiliated factories to support the whole country. Capital construction institutions in the East China region under the Central Government have also been strengthened. The three design offices under the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry, namely East China Machinery, Electrical Appliances, and Capital Construction, have been established, and the East China Machinery Design Office has transferred more than 200 engineers and technical personnel. In addition, the construction, electromechanical installation, and management personnel of various capital construction departments in East China have also been strengthened.

When transferring cadres, various units encountered some ideological obstacles. For example, the leadership of a certain steel plant was initially afraid that production would be impossible after the technical personnel were transferred. The factory actually had eight engineers, but when the East China Iron and Steel Branch went to transfer them, they concealed the situation and only reported six engineers. In addition, many technical personnel initially had concerns about participating in capital construction. For example, Sun Dehe, the chief engineer of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, initially felt that "the burden of participating in capital construction was too heavy" and that he was "a little unfamiliar with modern technology and design work." However, these situations were quickly reversed after patient education and persuasion by the leadership and self-ideological struggle.

After a part of the cadres were transferred, the leadership of each factory stepped up the work of promoting and training technical cadres. After Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Plant transferred a large number of technical personnel, new achievements continued to emerge in production through the joint efforts of new cadres and workers. Last year's production task of the open hearth furnace was completed ahead of schedule on December 21st. After Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 Plant transferred a group of cadres, the employees remaining in the plant launched a wave of technical learning, and their technical level was improved.

In addition, some units lacked an overall perspective and were unwilling to return technical personnel to their original units. For example, the Nanjing Municipal Enterprise Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had eight electrical personnel, and the United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had two technical personnel studying electrical appliances who were doing other work, but they were unwilling to quickly transfer them to the East China Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, which affected the establishment of the bureau's design institutions.

    华东抽调干部支援全国重点基本建设地区
    各单位抽走干部后加紧提拔和培养技术干部
    中央重工业部钢铁工业局华东分局、中央第一机械工业部机械工业管理局华东分局、上海铁路管理局及华东纺织管理局等单位积极抽调技术人员，支援全国重点基本建设工程及充实中央所属华东地区的基本建设机构。
    据目前初步统计，中央重工业部钢铁工业局华东分局和第一机械工业部机械工业管理局华东分局已从所属各厂中抽调出四百一十七名技术人员，分批输送至中央。其中钢铁部门抽调的干部占现有技术人员总数的百分之七十，上海铁路管理局也已在去年十二月二十四日抽调一百名技术人员赴东北，华东纺织管理局已决定在所属各厂中抽调成套的干部一千二百人支援全国。中央所属华东地区的基本建设机构也已得到充实。中央第一机械工业部所属华东机械、电器和基本建设三个设计处已经成立，华东机械设计处已抽调工程师、技术人员二百多人。此外，华东地区各基本建设部门的施工、机电安装及管理人员也已加强。
    各单位在抽调干部时，曾遇到某些思想障碍，如某钢铁厂领导方面起初恐怕技术人员调走后，生产将无法进行。厂里实际上有八名工程师，但当华东钢铁分局去抽调时，却打埋伏，只报了六个工程师；另外，很多技术人员起初对参加基本建设也有顾虑，如上海钢铁公司总工程师孙德和开始时感觉“参加基本建设担子太重”，“对近代化的技术和设计工作还有点陌生”。但这些情况经过领导方面耐心教育说服，和自己进行思想斗争后，都很快扭转过来。
    在抽走一部分干部后，各厂领导方面都加紧进行了提拔和培养技术干部的工作。上海钢铁公司第一厂抽调大批技术人员后，在新干部和职工共同努力下，生产上仍不断出现新的成绩，平炉去年生产任务，在十二月二十一日就提前完成。上海钢铁公司第三厂抽走一批干部后，留厂职工掀起了学习技术的热潮，技术水平都得到提高。
    此外，也有些单位缺乏整体观念不愿技术人员归队，如中共南京市企业委员会有八个电业人员，中共上海市委统一战线工作部有两个学电器的技术人员都在作别的工作，而不肯迅速调给中央燃料工业部华东电业管理局，以致影响该局设计机构的建立。
