    The World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna in December 1952 was a historically significant congress against war and for the defense of peace.

    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, having heard the report of the Chinese People's Delegation attending the Congress on the spirit and resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress, believes that the Congress was very broadly representative and that its achievements and impact were enormous and far-reaching. The two documents, the "World People's Peace Congress Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers" and the "World People's Peace Congress Declaration," and the three attachments adopted by the Congress, fully conform to the will and aspirations of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world and are an action program for easing the current international tension. We are determined to support and uphold them with unparalleled enthusiasm.

    At this Congress, the representatives of the people of all countries unanimously agreed that the root cause of the increasingly tense international situation and the crisis of world war is the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism. US imperialism is engaged in frantic war propaganda and arms expansion in order to maximize the profits of arms merchants, forming a serious threat to peace in Asia, Europe, and the whole world. The convening of the World People's Peace Congress is timely, and the resolutions it has passed will play a huge role in mobilizing and encouraging the further expansion of the movement to defend peace and oppose war.

    The Congress resolution emphasizes that in order to ease international tensions, the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France should immediately begin consultations and conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact. The people and governments of China and the Soviet Union have expressed their full support for this demand representing the will of all mankind and have made great efforts to achieve this goal. However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have consistently ignored the urgent demands of the people of the world for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Treaty. This shows that the aggressive bloc headed by the United States refuses the method of peaceful consultation and attempts to resolve international disputes by force. The current international tension continues to develop, and the World People's Peace Congress has once again put forward the demand that the governments of the five major powers immediately negotiate and conclude a peace pact, which is completely correct and necessary. We should make great efforts to realize this demand.

    The Congress demands the immediate cessation of all hostilities in Korea, which is the first step to ending the current war in Korea. After unilaterally announcing the suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations, the United States is continuing and attempting to expand the Korean War. Encouraged by the "Indian proposal" illegally passed by the United Nations General Assembly, it created a bloody massacre in the Koje-do prisoner-of-war camp, continues to conduct bacteriological warfare in northern Korea, and recently even used American aircraft to invade our Northeast airspace for strategic reconnaissance and repeatedly carried out bombing raids. All this shows that the American aggressors are blatantly disregarding the unanimous demand of peace-loving people all over the world for an immediate end to the Korean War and are plotting to prolong and expand this war of aggression.

    We believe that "the people can turn the tide." As long as the people of the world unite and work together to defend peace and strive together to implement the resolutions of the Congress, peace in Asia and the world can be defended, and the conspiracy of the warmongers to expand the war of aggression will surely fail. We fully support the Congress's demand for an immediate end to the Korean War and are convinced that as long as the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people all over the world can unite and persevere in their efforts to achieve it, this demand will certainly be realized.

    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace calls on the people of the whole country to enthusiastically support the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress and to strive to realize the various resolutions of the Congress.

    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace calls on the people of the whole country to launch the struggle to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression by striving to achieve the three great tasks of 1953, which are to continue to strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, while carrying out the country's planned construction, and to support the convening of the National People's Congress and people's congresses at all levels. Only in the effort to successfully complete the three major tasks can the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress be guaranteed.

    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace hopes that the local organizations of democratic parties, people's organizations, and local branches of the Committee will convene representative gatherings of people from all walks of life and, where possible, convene mass rallies to convey the resolutions and spirit of the Congress, and further mobilize and organize the people of the whole country to strive for the realization of the various resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    关于拥护世界人民和平大会决议的决议
    一九五二年十二月在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，是一个具有历史意义的反对战争、保卫和平的大会。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会听取了出席大会的中国人民代表团关于世界人民和平大会的精神和决议的报告，认为这次大会的代表性非常广泛，会议的成就和影响十分巨大而且深远，大会所通过的
    “世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书”和“世界人民和平大会宣言”两项文件及三项附件，完全符合中国人民和世界爱好和平人民的意志和愿望，是缓和目前国际紧张局势的行动纲领，我们决以无比的热诚，坚决地加以支持和拥护。
    在这次大会上，各国人民的代表一致认为造成日益紧张的国际局势和世界战争危机的根源，就是美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。美帝国主义为了使军火商人获得最大限度的利润而进行疯狂的战争宣传和扩军备战，形成了对亚洲、欧洲和全世界和平的严重威胁。世界人民和平大会的召开是及时的，它所通过的各项决议，对进一步扩大保卫和平、反对战争的运动将起巨大的动员和鼓舞的作用。
    大会决议强调提出为了缓和国际紧张局势，要求美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国五大国政府立即开始举行协商，缔结五大国和平公约。对于这个代表全人类意志的要求，中苏两国人民和政府均曾表示完全支持，并曾为达此目的进行了极大的努力。但是，美、英、法三国政府对全世界人民关于缔结五大国和平公约的迫切要求却一贯地置之不理。这说明了以美国为首的侵略集团拒绝和平协商的方法，妄图以武力解决国际争端。目前国际紧张局势仍在继续发展，世界人民和平大会再度提出五大国政府立即协商缔结和平公约的要求，是完全正确的和必要的，我们应该为实现这一要求尽极大的努力。
    大会要求在朝鲜立即停止一切敌对行动，这是停止朝鲜现行战争的首要步骤。美国在片面宣布中止朝鲜停战谈判之后，正在继续进行并妄图扩大朝鲜战争。它在联合国大会所非法通过的“印度提案”的鼓励之下，在蜂岩岛战俘营制造了血腥的大屠杀，在朝鲜北部继续进行着细菌战，最近更以美国飞机侵入我国东北领空，进行战略侦察，并多次施行轰炸，这一切都说明美国侵略者正悍然不顾全世界爱好和平人民对于立即停止朝鲜战争的一致要求，阴谋延长和扩大这一侵略战争。
    我们相信“人民能够扭转局势”，只要世界人民团结一致，共同起来保卫和平，共同努力实现大会决议，亚洲和世界的和平必能保卫，战争贩子扩大侵略战争的阴谋必将失败。我们完全拥护大会立即停止朝鲜战争的要求，并且确信只要中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人士能团结一致坚持不懈地为其实现而努力，这个要求就一定能够实现。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会号召全国人民热烈地支持世界人民和平大会的各项决议，并为实现大会的各项决议而奋斗。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会号召全国人民以努力实现一九五三年的三项伟大任务，来开展保卫和平反对侵略战争的斗争，这就是继续加强抗美援朝工作，同时进行国家的有计划建设，并拥护召开全国人民代表大会及各级人民代表大会。只有在胜利地完成三大任务的努力中，才能有保证地实现世界人民和平大会的决议。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会希望全国民主党派的地方组织、各人民团体和本会各地分会召开各界人民代表性的集会，并在可能的条件下召开群众大会来传达大会的决议和精神，进一步动员和组织全国人民为争取实现世界人民和平大会的各项决议而奋斗。
                中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
                        一九五三年一月二十六日
