Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: The National Working Conference of the Red Cross Society of China was recently held in Beijing. The conference started on December 15, 1952, and ended on December 21. More than 140 people attended the conference, including heads of local branches of the Red Cross Society of China, directors and staff of the General Association in Beijing. Representatives from the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, and relevant national people's organizations also participated.

Based on Premier Zhou's instructions at the Second National Health Conference on "Combining Health Work with Mass Movements" and the advanced experience of the Soviet Red Cross, the conference particularly emphasized the importance of the Red Cross's role in "mobilizing and organizing the masses to do popular work with prevention as the primary focus." This helped everyone to initially clarify the direction of the Red Cross's work, changing the viewpoint of some branches that only focused on medical work and simply requested the addition and expansion of hospitals and clinics. It also corrected the attendees' attitude towards developing membership, criticizing the attitude of blindly developing and acting rashly in some places. The conference also proposed the focus of work for 1953: extensively carrying out health publicity and education, actively conducting training in first aid, home nursing, new midwifery methods, childcare, etc.; organizing the masses in factories, mines, schools, and among women to carry out epidemic prevention, healthcare, and other work.

In order to do the above work well, the conference believed that the Red Cross branches throughout the country must closely cooperate with the various activities of the health departments under the leadership of the People's Government; strengthen ties with various people's organizations; further study the advanced experience of the Soviet Red Cross, exchange the experiences of various branches, in order to improve the technical level of medical and health personnel, and cultivate the mass perspective and in-depth mass style of Red Cross work cadres.

    中国红十字会总会
    在京召开全国工作会议
    【新华社十一日讯】中国红十字会总会最近在北京召开了中国红十字会全国工作会议。会议从一九五二年十二月十五日开始，到十二月二十一日结束。出席这次会议的有中国红十字会各地分会的负责人及总会在京理事、工作人员等共一百四十多人，中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会、中央人民政府内务部、中央人民政府卫生部、中央人民政府水利部及各有关的全国性人民团体都派了代表参加。
    大会根据周总理在第二届全国卫生会议上所作的“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的指示和苏联红十字会的先进经验，特别强调红十字会“动员和组织群众做好预防为主的普及工作”的重要性，使大家初步明确了红十字会工作的方向，改变了某些分会只着眼于医疗工作、单纯要求增设和扩充医院、诊疗所的观点；并端正了与会者对发展会员的态度，批判了有些地方盲目发展和草率从事的态度。会议并提出了一九五三年工作的重点：广泛开展卫生宣传教育，积极进行急救、家庭护理、新法接生、保育等训练；在工矿、学校、妇女中组织群众进行防疫、保健等工作。
    为了作好上述工作，会议认为：全国各地红十字会分会必须在人民政府领导下紧密配合卫生部门的各项活动；加强与各人民团体的联系；进一步学习苏联红十字会的先进经验，交流各分会的经验，以提高医药卫生人员的技术水平，培养红十字会工作干部的群众观点与深入群众的作风。
