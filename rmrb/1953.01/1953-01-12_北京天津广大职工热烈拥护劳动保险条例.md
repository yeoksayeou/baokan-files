    [By Our Newspaper] The broad masses of workers in Beijing and Tianjin were very happy to hear the news after the revised and promulgated "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China." They expressed their desire to improve the national construction in the future to thank Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government for their concern.
    The new Labor Insurance Regulations expanded the scope of implementation to basic construction units of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, and state-owned construction companies. Construction workers who are undergoing winter training particularly expressed their warm support. Ma Mingde, director of the Winter Training Class of the Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government, went to the workers' dormitory to congratulate the workers as soon as he saw the newspaper. His words were interrupted by enthusiastic applause before he could finish. When the news reached the various training classes of the Beijing Construction Company, the workers jumped with joy. The First Engineering Office's winter training class held a celebration meeting for more than 1,800 people that day, at which the workers shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Representatives from various classes of the Seventh Engineering Office's winter training class expressed their determination to study advanced experience and do a good job.
    The Beijing Garment Factory broadcast the news to everyone at noon. A female sewing worker in the Third Sewing Department said happily: This time, even the delivery and examination fees for our female workers' childbirths are covered by the public. Seventy days of rest are stipulated for twins and difficult births. Chairman Mao is really taking good care of us!
    The revised Labor Insurance Regulations were announced when the Fourth Congress of Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions was opened. Before the opening of the congress, the "Decision on Several Amendments to the Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" of the Government Administration Council was first read out, and the whole audience burst into warm applause. Fu Hongbin, a famous labor model in the construction industry, was also a representative to the congress. He said: Our construction workers have long been looking forward to the implementation of labor insurance, and now we have finally waited for it. In the future, the country will build many factories and mines. Our construction workers have important and glorious tasks. We must learn advanced experience and do a good job to repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their concern.
    When the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Workers' Sanatorium held a forum, Li Zhenzhou, a worker from the Tianjin Garment Factory, said: "I was hospitalized in the sanatorium for gastritis and have been here for almost six months. Some time ago, I was worried about what to do after the six-month medical period expires. Now the new method extends the medical period until the doctor decides to stop the treatment. I am really happy to hear that. I will definitely rest assured and strive to recover my health as soon as possible and contribute my strength to the motherland." When the newspaper was delivered to the Tianjin Post Office, Liu Yuansen of the Finance Section saw that the previous requirement of ten years of work experience in this enterprise to be eligible for retirement has now been changed to five years. He said with emotion: "It is only on the basis of the development of production that labor insurance benefits can be gradually improved in this way. We must strive to realize the first five-year plan ahead of schedule!" Workers from other factories also held forums to express their support and promised to do a good job in production to thank Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government for their concern.

    北京天津广大职工热烈拥护劳动保险条例
    【本报讯】中华人民共和国劳动保险条例修正公布以后，北京市和天津市广大职工听到这个消息，都非常高兴，纷纷表示要把今后的国家建设事业搞好，来感谢毛主席、共产党和人民政府的关怀。
    新的劳动保险条例把实施范围扩大到工矿交通事业的基本建设单位和国营建筑公司，正在进行冬季训练的建筑工人，特别表示热烈拥护。中央人民政府建筑工程部直属工程公司工人冬季训练班主任马明德一看到报纸，就到工人宿舍去向工人道喜。他的话还没说完，就被热烈的掌声打断了。当消息传到北京市建筑公司各个训练班时，工人们也欢喜得跳了起来。第一工程处冬训班当天就开了一千八百多人的庆祝大会，会上工人们高呼：“毛主席万岁！”第七工程处冬训班各班代表纷纷表示要努力学习先进经验，搞好工作。
    北京被服厂在中午利用广播把这个消息传给了大家。第三缝纫部一个锁缀女工高兴地说：这次连我们女工生孩子的接生费和检查费公家都给负担了，双生、难产还规定了七十天的休息日，毛主席真是照顾的周到呵！
    修改后的劳动保险条例公布的时候，正赶上天津市总工会第四届会员代表大会开幕。大会开幕前，首先宣读了政务院“关于中华人民共和国劳动保险条例若干修正的决定”，全场报以热烈的掌声。著名的建筑业劳动模范傅鸿宾也是大会代表，他说：我们建筑工人早就盼着实行劳动保险，现在可盼到了。今后国家要建设许多工厂矿山，我们建筑工人的任务重大，也很光荣，我们一定要学习先进经验，把工作搞好，报答毛主席、共产党对我们的关怀。
    天津市总工会工人疗养院开座谈会时，天津被服厂工人李振洲说：“我得胃炎住到疗养院，已经快六个月了，前些日子我正担心：六个月医疗期满后生活该怎么办。现在新办法把医疗期延长到医生决定停止医疗时为止，我听了真高兴。我一定安心疗养，争取早些恢复健康，为祖国贡献自己的力量。”报纸送到天津邮局，财务科的刘元森看到过去本企业工龄十年才够养老条件，现在改为五年，他感动地说：“都是在生产发展的基础上，才能这样逐步改善劳保待遇。我们一定要争取第一个五年计划提前实现！”其他各厂工人也纷纷举行座谈会，表示拥护，并保证拿搞好生产来感谢毛主席、共产党和人民政府对他们的关怀。
