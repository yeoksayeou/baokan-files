    "I don't want the fare, this is the twenty-seventh time."
    In the morning, the clock on the table had just struck eight when the guard squad leader Fu Baosheng came in to report: "A female family member has arrived, looking for Jin Datao. Does our company even have such a person?"
    "You have a good memory! Our company's bugler is named Jin Datao, don't you know that?" Instructor Xu Fangmao said, standing up to greet the female family member.
    A pedicab was parked outside the gate. A rural working woman was standing beside it. The pedicab driver was standing on the other side, smoking a cigarette. Xu Fangmao walked over and asked, "Are you Comrade Jin Datao's family member?" Then he took down the luggage and said, "Come on, let's go inside." He turned to the pedicab driver and said, "You pedaled from there? How much is the fare?" The pedicab driver said, "From Dazhimen to the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army, then pedaled here. I don't want the fare, just please write a few words in this diary of mine." He took out a red-covered diary and handed it to Instructor Xu. Xu Fangmao was a bit puzzled when he heard the words "don't want the fare." He asked Fu Baosheng to take the family member to the company headquarters first, and he opened the diary to take a look. Hey! A picture of Chairman Mao was neatly pasted on the first page. On the second page, the four characters "Patriotic Pact" were drawn in pen, and on the third page, eight smaller characters were written: "When drinking water, don't forget the well-digger; supporting the army and cherishing their families is our duty." Below were lines of patriotic covenants. Further down were records of each instance of supporting the army and cherishing their families. The pedicab driver saw him flip to this page and said, "I don't want the fare, this is the twenty-seventh time. Please leave a few words so I can go." Instructor Xu asked him why he didn't charge family members of soldiers for rides. He said, "We pedicab drivers don't have much strength to contribute to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, only this little ability to express my love for the motherland and my support for the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army. You are working hard every day to protect the people's happiness; the Volunteer Army is fighting desperately with the American devils on the Korean front day and night. The people of the whole country regard you as the most lovable people. It's nothing for the comrades' families to take a ride in my pedicab when they come from afar to visit. Comrade, leave a few words and go back to work!" Instructor Xu felt in his pocket and realized he didn't have a pen. He said to him, "Wait a few minutes, I'll go back and get a pen."
    After Instructor Xu entered the room, he read the book in detail again. It turned out that this pedicab driver's name was Chen Chunbao, and he lived at No. 105 Duofu Lane, Hankou. The book was full of his records of each time he volunteered to pull family members of soldiers and wounded and sick Volunteer soldiers. Some unit leaders or parties involved had written words of praise and gratitude on it. Comrades from the Women's Cultural School of the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army wrote: "...Your actions demonstrate the noble qualities of loving the motherland and loving the people. All the comrades in our team express our sincere thanks to you. We must learn from your spirit..."
    It turned out that Chen Chunbao had established this patriotic pact since the beginning of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" movement. He said, "I feel more honored to have the opportunity to serve the People's Liberation Army, the Volunteer Army, and the revolutionary families of soldiers than anything else. They are sacrificing their lives to protect our peaceful life. Can't I sacrifice one or two hours of labor?" Before leaving, he shook Comrade Xu Fangmao's hand and said, "I haven't done enough in supporting the army and cherishing their families, please forgive me! I will definitely study your spirit of serving the people better in the future."   Third Battalion, Public Security Regiment of the Central South Military Region Jiang Sanyuan (image)

### “我不要车钱，这是第二十七次了”

    “我不要车钱，这是第二十七次了”
    早晨，桌上的时钟刚敲过八点，卫兵班长傅保生进来报告：“来了位女家属，要找靳大套。咱连到底有没有这个人？”
     “你真好记性！咱连的司号员就叫靳大套，你都不知道吗？”指导员徐芳茂说完就站起身来，出门去迎接那位女家属。
    大门外停着一辆三轮车。旁边站着一个农村劳动妇女。三轮车工人站在另一边吸着纸烟。徐芳茂边走边问：“你就是靳大套同志的家属吗？”接着就把行李拿下来说：“走，到屋里去吧。”又回头对三轮车工人说：“从那儿蹬到这里的？要多少车费？”三轮车工人说：“从大智门到第四野战军后勤部，又蹬到这里。我不要车费，只请你在我这个日记本上写下几个字就行。”说着就拿出一个红皮日记本递给徐指导员。徐芳茂一听“不要车费”这句话就有点莫名其妙。他让傅保生先把家属领到连部去，自己把日记本打开一看，嘿！毛主席的像片端端正正地贴在第一页，第二页上用钢笔描绘了“爱国公约”四个大字，第三页上写着八个小一点的字：“喝水不忘挖井人，拥军优属是本分。”下面就是一条条的爱国公约。再往下是每次拥军优属的事实记载。三轮车工人看他翻到这里便说：“我不要车钱，这是第二十七次了。请你留个字我好走。”徐指导员问他为什么军属乘车就不要钱。他说：“我们蹬三轮的没有好大力量贡献给抗美援朝运动，只有这点能耐来表示我对祖国的热爱和对解放军、志愿军的拥护。你们为了保卫人民的幸福，天天艰苦地工作着；志愿军日日夜夜在朝鲜前线和美国鬼拚命。全国人民都把你们当成最可爱的人。同志们的家属老远地来探望，坐了我一回车算不了什么一回事。同志，你留下几个字就回去工作吧！”徐指导员摸了一下口袋里，没带笔。就对他说：“你再等几分钟，我回去拿笔去。”
    徐指导员进屋后又把本子详细地看了一遍。原来这个三轮工人名叫陈春保，家住汉口多福巷一百零五号。本子上面全是他每次义务拉军人家属和志愿军伤病员的记载。有的部队首长或当事人在上面写着称赞和感激他的话。第四野战军后勤部妇女文化学校的同志就这样写：“……您这一行动表现了爱祖国爱人民的高贵品质。我队全体同志对你表示十分感谢。我们要学习你这种精神。……”
    原来陈春保自从“抗美援朝”开始后，他就订下这条爱国公约。他说：“有机会为解放军、志愿军、革命军属服务，我感觉比什么都光荣。人家为了保卫我们过和平日子，把生命都贡献出来。难道我就不能牺牲一两个钟头的劳动吗？”临走时他握着徐芳茂同志的手说：“我对拥军优属工作做得还不够，请原谅吧！我今后一定更好地学习你们为人民服务的精神。”  中南军区公安团三营  江三源（图片）
