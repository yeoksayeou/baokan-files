The Ryukyu Islands are scattered on the sea between northeast of Taiwan, China and southwest of Kyushu Island, Japan, including seven groups of islands: the Senkaku Islands, the Sakishima Islands, the Daito Islands, the Okinawa Islands, the Amami Islands, the Tokara Islands, and the Osumi Islands. Each group has many large and small islands, with a total of more than fifty named islands and more than four hundred unnamed islets, with a total land area of 4,670 square kilometers. The largest island in the archipelago is Okinawa Island (i.e., Greater Ryukyu Island) in the Okinawa Islands, with an area of 1,211 square kilometers; the second largest is Amami Ōshima in the Amami Islands, with an area of 730 square kilometers. The Ryukyu Islands stretch for 1,000 kilometers, with the East China Sea on its inner side and the open Pacific Ocean on its outer side.

After the United States occupied the Ryukyu Islands in June 1945, it began to build military bases on the islands. As the United States' plans for aggression on the Asian continent failed, the construction of bases in the Ryukyu Islands became even more active. Even before the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, military projects in the Ryukyu Islands had already occupied one-third of the land, with over $200 million spent on base construction. Subsequently, the base construction plan was repeatedly expanded and carried out at an even greater pace. On June 22, 1951, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine revealed the ambitions of the American aggressors: "America's goal in Okinawa is to dominate Asia with its air force, making it the largest base in the Pacific. From Okinawa, B-29 bombers can reach most of the Asian mainland, with a bombing radius that may include all of China and most of Siberia—including the Trans-Siberian Railway. B-36 bombers can reach even greater distances." On September 8th of last year, American officials in Okinawa openly declared: "Nearly $480 million will be used to transform Okinawa into the 'Gibraltar of the Pacific.' Construction is proceeding according to plan, and typhoon-proof highways, airfields, barracks, command posts, and other military facilities will spread throughout the island." On the other hand, according to recent Japanese newspaper reports, the United States has built three underground oil depots with a capacity of 80,000 tons under the Ukishima Shrine at the entrance of Naha Port in Okinawa, bases are scattered around the islands surrounding Okinawa, with more than twenty large airfields built, and radar has been installed on Amami Ōshima, Miyako Island, and Okinoerabu Island. Many islands have military roads that also serve as airstrips. American news agencies have also admitted more than once: "American B-29 bombers take off from Okinawa every day to attack North Korea."

Simultaneous with the construction and use of military bases in the Ryukyu Islands, American aggressors are actively plotting to permanently occupy the Ryukyu Islands. Soon after the United States occupied the Ryukyu Islands, it monopolized all political power. Since last year, the American aggressors, disregarding the fact that no international agreement, including the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," stipulated the trusteeship of the Ryukyu Islands, disregarding the repeated statements of the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China, and disregarding the resolute opposition of one million Ryukyu people, colluded with the Japanese Yoshida government to stipulate unilaterally in its one-sidedly formulated "peace treaty" with Japan: "Japan will agree to any proposal by the United States to the United Nations to place the Ryukyu Islands south of 29 degrees north latitude... under the United Nations trusteeship system, with the United States as the sole administering authority. Before such a proposal is made and affirmative action is taken on such a proposal, the United States shall have the right to exercise all and any administrative, legislative, and judicial powers over the territory and residents of such islands, including their territorial waters." After the United States used such despicable means to unilaterally cloak its aggressive act of indefinitely occupying the Ryukyu Islands with a "legal" cloak, it established the Ryukyu puppet government headed by Hidehei Higa on the island on April 1st of last year.

For more than seven years, American aggressors have used extremely barbaric and tyrannical means to turn the Ryukyu Islands into an American military base; one million Ryukyu people, under American enslavement and exploitation, have fallen into deep water and are living an extremely miserable life. All residents of land designated by the U.S. military as military targets have been driven out of their homelands. Now, in Okinawa alone, two-thirds of the land has been requisitioned for military use. The Ryukyu people have not only had their land seized, but also most of the young people with labor power have been forced to participate in the slave labor of building American military bases. American aggressors cruelly force the Ryukyu people to destroy their peaceful homes and fishing villages on which they depend for their livelihoods with bayonets, resulting in the abandonment of farmland, lack of food, stagnation of the fishing industry, and the sugar industry, which was quite large before the war, has not yet recovered. At the same time, the U.S. military uses a reign of terror to suppress the resistance of the Ryukyu people. Since 1947, the U.S. military has prohibited residents from traveling throughout the island under the pretext of keeping military secrets. American military police and their running dogs, the Ryukyu police (all local ruffians who used to serve as pawns of Japanese warlords and are now being re-employed by the U.S. military), are all over the island. Villages are separated by barbed wire fences, and villagers from two villages must report to the police and obtain permission before they can visit each other, otherwise they will be punished for "illegally crossing the border." Highways are also lined with barbed wire, some of which are even electrified. As a result, the Ryukyu people are prohibited from foreign trade, transportation is obstructed, farming and fishing are restricted, and all freedom rights are deprived by the U.S. military. Moreover, 90 percent of the houses on the island were destroyed by artillery fire during the war, and the vast majority of Ryukyu people still have no place to live. Last year, when the northern part of Ryukyu suffered a famine, the victims were forced to eat lizards and snakes to prolong their lives. Ryukyu workers who work for the U.S. military earn only one-ninetieth of the wages of American workers, and Ryukyu women employed in U.S. military bars, restaurants, and agencies earn a maximum of only four U.S. dollars per month. The licentious and shameless U.S. military has also brought a large number of "Jeep girls" to Ryukyu, and the U.S. military stationed in the Ryukyu Islands barbarously humiliates Ryukyu women. The atrocities of U.S. troops shooting Ryukyu people at will are also common.

The Ryukyu Islands used to be an area of fierce fighting between the United States and Japan, and the local residents suffered heavy casualties. The wounds of war are deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Ryukyu people. The Ryukyu people hate war and fervently demand peace. The postwar policy of American aggressors to turn Ryukyu into a military base and enslavement and exploitation colony has forced the Ryukyu people to stand up and launch struggles against the American occupiers in various ways. Initially, the Ryukyu people, driven by hunger, began to seize U.S. military supplies, and later gradually developed into openly attacking U.S. troops and seizing large quantities of military supplies. According to Japanese newspaper reports, 97 pieces of military supplies were seized from the Ta Bas (transliteration) barracks of the Kadena Air Base Air Force in Okinawa Island in January of the year before last. On January 21st of last year, 7.5 tons of gunpowder were lost from the No. 18 gunpowder depot of the Kadena Air Base Air Force. The U.S. military's ammunition depots on the island often explode "for no reason." For example, in August 1948, on a small island near Okinawa Island, the U.S. military's ammunition depot exploded for a day and a night, destroying all the ammunition stored by the U.S. military on the island. Last year, U.S. news dispatches from Taiwan revealed that Ryukyu people's guerrillas launched fierce struggles against the U.S. occupying forces, and the Ryukyu people had even sneaked into the Kataena (transliteration) airport on Okinawa Island to destroy the airport.

Ryukyu workers who are forced to work for the U.S. military constantly carry out strikes and go-slows to resist the enslavement of the U.S. military. In June of last year, Ryukyu workers building U.S. military projects on Okinawa Island held a struggle demanding higher wages, despite the U.S. military's ban, and received the support of workers throughout the island. In July, workers from the Matsumura contracting group on the island held a strike against layoffs, and demonstrations in support of the strike were held throughout the island. The Ryukyu people's struggle against the American occupation has been combined with the movement against war and for the defense of peace, and is developing more vigorously. On May Day last year, workers, staff, and citizens of Okinawa Island, under the call of the Ryukyu People's Party, held a meeting and demonstration to guarantee the right to life, despite the suppression of the U.S. military. Recently, the people of Okinawa Island have also widely launched a movement against the Ryukyu puppet government's conscription for the Japanese Yoshida government.

The Ryukyu people's struggle against the United States turning Ryukyu into a military base, against American enslavement and rule, and for freedom, liberation, and peace is not isolated. It is inseparable from the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace, and it is also inseparable from the struggle of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions and the people of all countries in the world to defend peace. Therefore, although the American occupiers are carrying out barbaric suppression against the Ryukyu people, final victory will surely belong to the Ryukyu people.

### 琉球群岛人民反对美国占领的斗争

    琉球群岛人民反对美国占领的斗争
    琉球群岛散布在我国台湾东北和日本九洲岛西南之间的海面上，包括尖阁诸岛、先岛诸岛、大东诸岛、冲绳诸岛、大岛诸岛、土噶喇诸岛、大隅诸岛等七组岛屿，每组都有许多大小岛屿，总计共有五十个以上有名称的岛屿和四百多个无名小岛，全部陆地面积为四千六百七十平方公里。群岛中最大的岛是冲绳诸岛中的冲绳岛（即大琉球岛），面积一千二百十一平方公里；其次是大岛诸岛中的奄美大岛，面积七百三十平方公里。琉球群岛绵互达一千公里，它的内侧是我国东海，外侧就是太平洋公海。
    美国在一九四五年六月占领了琉球群岛后，就着手在该岛建筑军事基地。随着美国在亚洲大陆上侵略计划的破产，琉球基地的建筑工程也就更趋积极起来。远在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争前，美国在琉球群岛的军事工程就已占用了琉球三分之一的土地，用作建造基地的费用超过了两亿美元。其后，琉球基地的建造计划一再扩大，而且以更大的速度进行着。一九五一年六月二十二日“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志曾透露出美国侵略者的野心：“美国在冲绳岛的目标是用空军独霸亚洲，要使它成为太平洋的最大基地。由冲绳岛起飞，B二十九型轰炸机能达到亚洲大部分内陆地区，轰炸半径可能包括中国全部和西伯利亚大部地区——包括西伯利亚大铁路。B三十六型轰炸机则可达到更远的距离。”去年九月八日，冲绳岛的美国官员竟公然宣布：“用来将冲绳岛改变成‘太平洋的直布罗陀’的全部经费将近四亿八千万美元。建筑工作正在按计划进行，防台风的公路、飞机场、兵营、司令部以及其他军事设备，将遍布全岛。”另一方面，据不久前日本的报纸消息称：美国在冲绳岛那霸港入口处的浮岛神社下，已修建了具有八万吨容量的三个地下油库，冲绳岛周围各岛都散布着基地，共修建有二十几个大型飞机场，并且在奄美大岛、宫古岛、冲之永良部岛等岛屿上都装置了雷达。许多岛上都建成了兼作飞机跑道用的军用公路。而美国通讯社也早经不止一次地承认：“美国B二十九型轰炸机，每天都从冲绳岛起飞去袭击北朝鲜”。
    与建筑及使用琉球军事基地同时，美国侵略者积极阴谋永久霸占琉球群岛。美国占领琉球后不久，就独揽了琉球的一切政权。去年以来，美国侵略者竟不顾“开罗宣言”、“波茨坦公告”等各项国际协议中都没有规定托管琉球群岛的决定，也不顾苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府的一再声明，更不顾
    一百万琉球人民的坚决反对，竟勾结日本吉田政府，擅自在它片面制订的对日“和约”中规定：“日本对于美国向联合国提出将北纬二十九度以南的琉球群岛……置于联合国托管制度之下，而以美国为唯
    一管理当局的任何提议，将予同意。在提出此种建议，并对此种建议采取肯定措施以前，美国将有权对此等岛屿之领土及其居民，包括其领水，行使一切及任何行政、立法与司法权力。”美国以这样卑鄙的手段擅自为其无限期霸占琉球群岛的侵略行为披上“合法”的外衣后，并于去年四月一日在岛上建立了以比嘉秀平为首的琉球傀儡政府。
    七年多以来，美国侵略者用极其野蛮横暴的手段，把琉球群岛变成了美国的军事基地；一百万琉球人民在美国的奴役与剥削下，已陷在水深火热中，过着极为悲惨的生活。凡是被美军圈定为构筑军事目标的土地，全部居民便被赶出自己的乡土，现在仅冲绳岛就有三分之二的土地被征作军用。琉球人民不仅土地被强占，而且有劳动力的年青人大部被强迫去参加建筑美国军事基地的奴隶劳动。美国侵略者用枪刺残酷地逼迫琉球人民自己去毁灭赖以为生的和平家园与渔村，以致全岛农田荒芜、食粮缺乏、渔业不振，战前颇具规模的糖业也迄未恢复。同时，美军用恐怖的警察统治压制琉球人民的反抗。从一九四七年起，美军就借口保守军事机密，禁止居民旅行全岛。美国宪兵及其走狗琉球警察（都是过去充当过日本军阀的爪牙现在被美军起用的当地流氓）布满全岛。村落和村落之间布有铁丝网，两村的村民来往必须先向警察报告并获得允许，否则就要以“偷越界线”治罪，公路旁也布有铁丝网，有的甚至通有电流。因而，琉球人民对外贸易被禁止，交通被阻挠，耕种和捕鱼被限制，一切的自由权利全被美军剥夺。而且，战争中炮火损毁了全岛房屋的百分之九十，迄今绝大部分琉球人民无处栖身。去年琉球北部一带遭受饥荒时，灾民竟被迫吃蜥蜴、蛇等以延续生命。在美军中做工的琉球工人，工资只及美国工人的九十分之一，受雇在美军酒吧间、饭馆及机关中的琉球妇女，每月工资最多只有四块美元。荒淫无耻的美军，也给琉球带来了大批的“吉普女郎”，驻在琉球群岛的美军野蛮地凌辱琉球妇女。美军随便枪杀琉球人民的暴行也屡见不鲜。
    琉球群岛曾经是美国和日本激战地区，当地居民死亡惨重，战争创伤深深烙印在琉球人民心中。琉球人民痛恶战争，热烈要求和平。战后美国侵略者变琉球为基地和奴役剥削的军事殖民地政策，逼得琉球人民不得不挺身起来用各种方式展开反对美国占领者的斗争。最初，为饥饿所迫的琉球人民，开始夺取美军物资，后来逐渐发展为公开袭击美军并大量夺取军用物资。据日本报纸消息：前年一月冲绳岛嘉手纳机场航空队的太巴斯（译音）兵营就被夺去了九十七件军火物资。去年一月二十一日，嘉手纳机场航空队第十八号火药库又丢失了火药七吨半。岛上美军的军火仓库，经常“无故”爆炸。例如一九四八年八月，在冲绳岛附近的一个小岛上，美军的军火库就爆炸了一天一夜，把美军储藏在该岛的军火全部炸毁。去年从台湾传出的美国新闻电讯中，曾透露琉球人民游击队和美国占领军展开了激烈斗争，琉球人民且曾潜入冲绳岛的卡台那（译音）机场中将机场破坏。
    被迫为美军工作的琉球工人不断地进行罢工、怠工以反抗美军的奴役。去年六月，冲绳岛建筑美国军事工程的琉球工人，不顾美军的禁令，举行了要求提高工资的斗争，得到了全岛工人的支持。七月，岛上松村包工组的工人举行反对解雇的罢工，全岛各地都举行了支持罢工的示威。琉球人民反对美国占领的斗争已和反对战争、保卫和平的运动结合起来，并正在更有力地向前发展着。去年的五一节，冲绳岛的工人、职员和市民，在琉球人民党的号召下，不顾美军的镇压，举行了保障生活权利大会和示威大游行。最近，冲绳岛人民又广泛地展开了反对琉球傀儡政府为日本吉田政府征兵的运动。
    琉球人民反对美国变琉球为军事基地、反对美国奴役统治争取自由解放与和平的斗争不是孤立的，它是和日本人民争取独立、民主与和平的斗争分不开，也是和亚洲及太平洋区域人民以及全世界各国人民保卫和平的斗争分不开的，因而，虽然美国占领者对琉球人民实行野蛮镇压，但最后胜利必定是属于琉球人民的。
