    Grasp Leadership in Technical Education During Winter Training
    The winter training work in some units in the Northeast and North China regions has entered the stage of technical education.
    The success or failure of technical education is directly related to whether this year's construction tasks can be guaranteed to be completed, whether the quality of projects can be guaranteed, and whether construction costs can be reduced. Because this year's engineering tasks are larger than last year, more complex and modern factories are being built than last year, and factory-style and mechanized construction methods are gradually increasing. If the technical level of workers is not improved, the construction force is not strengthened, and the construction level is not raised, it will not be possible to guarantee the completion of this year's tasks.
    The time for technical education is short, but the requirements are high. At the same time, workers' technical levels are different, their types of work are different, their requirements are different, and teaching methods are also different. Therefore, the organization and leadership of technical education are extremely complex and detailed. Leading cadres of all units must take effective measures to overcome the shortcomings that exist in political education, such as weak organization and leadership, a small number of low-quality teachers, teaching content that is divorced from reality, and generalized teaching methods. The idea that technical education is a matter for technical personnel, and that non-technical cadres of the Party, government, and trade unions can ignore technical education, is extremely wrong and must be corrected. In the technical education stage, in addition to continuing to strengthen political and ideological leadership, as many technical personnel and workers with good skills as possible should be assigned to do tutoring work, and as much practical operation performance and mutual teaching and learning as possible should be organized among workers, so as to achieve more practical results in a short period of time.
    Now the construction time is very short. All units that have not entered the stage of technical education should immediately do all the preparatory work. All units that have already carried out technical education should conduct in-depth and specific leadership, and discover and solve problems at any time.

    抓紧冬训中技术教育的领导
    东北、华北地区部分单位的冬训工作已经进入技术教育阶段。
    技术教育的成败是直接关系着今年能否保证完成施工任务、保证工程质量和降低工程成本的关键。因为今年工程任务比去年大，复杂的现代化的工厂建设比去年更多，工厂化、机械化的施工方法也逐渐增加，如果不提高工人的技术水平，加强施工力量，提高施工水平，就不能保证今年任务的完成。
    技术教育的时间短促，而要求又高；同时，工人的技术水平不同，工种不同，要求不同，教学方法也不同。因此，技术教育的组织领导工作是极其复杂细致的。各单位的领导干部必须采取有效的措施，克服在政治教育中存在的组织领导薄弱、教员量少质低、教学内容脱离实际、教学方法一般化的缺点。那种认为技术教育是技术人员的事，认为党、行政、工会的非技术干部可以不管技术教育的思想，是极端错误的，必须纠正。在技术教育阶段中，除了继续加强政治思想领导外，应尽量多派技术人员和技术好的工人作辅导工作，尽量多组织工人实际操作表演和互教互学，才能在短期内收到更多的实效。
    现在离施工时间已经很短，凡是没有进入技术教育阶段的单位，应即做好一切准备工作；凡是已经进行技术教育的单位，应该深入具体领导，随时发现问题，解决问题。
