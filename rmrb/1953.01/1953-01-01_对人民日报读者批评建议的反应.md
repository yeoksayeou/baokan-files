Concerning the Case of Nie Wenying's Death in Custody:
    Responsible Cadres of the Tongxian Special District Have Been Seriously Dealt With

    Editor: Regarding the case of Nie Wenying's unreasonable detention and death by the Changping County People's Court of Hebei Province (as reported on the readers' letters page on August 23, 1952), the Hebei Provincial People's Supervision Committee previously notified the Tongxian Special District to investigate the responsibilities of the relevant cadres in the case and deal with them seriously. Now, the Tongxian Special District has submitted to and been approved by the Provincial People's Supervision Committee to make the following decisions: Ren Zuoshuang, Deputy President of the Changping County People's Court, is dismissed from his post; Liu Wan'an, surveyor, is dismissed and held legally responsible; Li Yu, cadre of the detention center, is dismissed; and Kang Yongshun, acting Deputy President, is given a major demerit.

    The Changping County People's Court conducted a profound review of this incident during the judicial reform movement to learn from the lessons and improve its future work.

The Publishing Administration of the General Administration of Publications Has Urged its Subordinate Units to Improve Mail Order Services

    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" page on August 13, 1952, published a summary of readers' letters requesting book distribution organizations to improve mail order services. The situations mentioned therein truthfully reflected the current chaotic phenomena and serious shortcomings existing in mail order services. Readers' opinions are of great help in improving mail order services.

    After seeing the readers' criticisms published in the newspaper, our office instructed the responsible comrades of relevant units to conduct in-depth inspections and study ways to improve this work. On August 18, our office convened a meeting of responsible personnel from several distribution units handling mail order services, requiring them to conduct serious self-criticism and propose improvement suggestions. Under our supervision, the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch, the China International Bookstore, and the Beijing Branch of the China Book Distribution Company successively conducted mass and relatively comprehensive inspections of mail order services within their organizations and wrote written self-criticism reports. We believe that the key to improving mail order services is, first and foremost, to strengthen the political education of staff and enhance their sense of responsibility. This inspection was a profound and effective education for the staff of each mail order unit. As for specific improvement measures in business systems and technology, this Administration issued a resolution on December 28, 1952. We hope that readers will continue to offer opinions on bookstore distribution work in the future, so that our office can promptly urge various distribution units to improve their work.

    出版总署发行管理局已督促所属单位改进邮购代办工作
    编辑同志：一九五二年八月十三日“读者来信专页”发表了读者要求图书发行机构改进邮购代办工作的来信综述。其中提出的情况，真实地反映了目前存在于邮购代办工作中的混乱现象和严重缺点。读者的意见对于改进邮购代办工作有很大的作用。
    我处见到报上发表读者的批评后，就指示有关单位负责同志深入检查，并研究改进这一工作的办法。八月十八日，我处召集有关的几个发行单位办理邮购代办工作的负责人员座谈，要求他们认真进行检讨，并提出改进意见。新华书店北京分店、国际书店总店和中国图书发行公司北京分公司三个单位，在我们的督促下，先后在机关内部对邮购代办工作作了群众性的和比较全面的检查，并写了书面的检讨报告。我们认为：改进邮购代办工作的关键，首先是加强工作人员的政治教育，提高他们的责任心。这次检查，对各邮购代办单位的工作人员是一个深刻而有效的教育。至于业务制度和技术方面的具体改进办法，本署已在一九五二年十二月二十八日发表决议。我们希望读者今后对书店发行工作经常提出意见，帮助我处能及时地督促各发行单位改进工作。
