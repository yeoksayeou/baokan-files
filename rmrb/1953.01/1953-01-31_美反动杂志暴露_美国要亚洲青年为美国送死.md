    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 28th (TASS dispatch): American political circles and newspapers and magazines have recently been widely discussing the so-called "Asian Defense Force." A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" published an article that clearly reveals the hidden purpose of the American aggressors' new plans for Asia.
    The author of the article's interest in Asian countries stems from the perspective of "sources of combat power." The article says, "Asian countries have millions of able-bodied men of fighting age." It is these millions of people who attract the U.S.'s cannon fodder seekers.
    "U.S. News & World Report" shamelessly and blatantly estimated how much cannon fodder could be provided to the American aggressors from those Asian countries that, according to Washington's plans, must be drawn into the scope of American policy. The article pointed out that Indochina could provide 2.7 million people; the Philippines—2 million; Japan—nearly 9 million; Thailand—nearly 2 million; Malaya—625,000, etc. The magazine similarly estimated the war potential of Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and Burma. The magazine concluded: "The non-communist countries of Asia have a total population of more than 700 million. Among them, there are 70 million able-bodied men aged 20 to 34, who are the main manpower for Asian self-defense." But even the author of the article seemed to think this figure was arrogant. The author felt that the growing anti-imperialist movement in Asian countries could not be ignored, so he did not include the able-bodied men of India, Pakistan, Burma, and Indonesia in the calculation. The magazine pointed out that these countries "may be unwilling to join together to establish" the notorious "Asian Defense Force." After considering this point, and then calculating according to arithmetic, the following conclusion was obtained: In any case, the United States can obtain "nearly four million soldiers" from Indochina, the Philippines, Japan, Thailand, and Malaya.
    The magazine pre-assigned tasks to the American organizers of the "Asian Defense Force" and those who must be included in this "force" to serve as American cannon fodder. It wrote: "The mission of the new Asian army will be ground combat..." As for the United States, the magazine believes that its contribution to the above "force" will include bombers, fighters, warships, and military delegations.
    The article published in "U.S. News & World Report" shows that although the American aggressors failed in their war gamble in Korea, they have not abandoned their plans to expand the war in Asia. However, they want to use the people of other countries as cannon fodder in this war. The magazine openly pointed out that the composition of this "Asian Defense Force" will "greatly reduce the danger to which American youth who have to fight in large numbers in that area are subjected."
    The magazine believes that the "millions of able-bodied men of fighting age" in Asian countries must fight and die for the benefit of Americans.

### 美反动杂志暴露  美国要亚洲青年为美国送死

    美反动杂志暴露
    美国要亚洲青年为美国送死
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日电：美国政界和报章杂志近来都在广泛地讨论着所谓“亚洲人防御部队”的问题。最近一期“美国新闻与世界报道”刊载了一篇文章，清楚地显示出美国侵略者对亚洲的新计划所隐含的目的。
    该文作者对亚洲国家发生兴趣，是从“战斗力量来源”的观点出发的。该文说：“亚洲国家有千百万正当战斗年龄的壮丁。”就是这千百万人吸引着美国的炮灰觅取者。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”厚颜无耻地、露骨地估计了一下从那些根据华盛顿计划必须被拉入美国政策的范围内的亚洲国家，能够为美国侵略者提供多少炮灰。该文指出，印度支那可以出二百七十万人；菲律宾——两百万；日本——近九百万；泰国——近二百万；马来亚——六十二万五千等等。该杂志以同样的方式估计了印尼、印度、巴基斯坦和缅甸的战争潜力。该杂志总计道：“亚洲的非共产党国家中总共有七亿多人口。其中二十岁到三十四岁的壮丁有七千万人，这是亚洲自卫的主要人力。”但是即使该文的作者也似乎觉得这个数字是狂妄的。该文作者觉得不能忽视亚洲国家中日益壮大的反帝国主义运动，因此他把对印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸和印尼的壮丁没有计算在内。该杂志指出，这些国家“可能不愿意一同来建立”声名狼藉的“亚洲人防御部队”。该杂志考虑到了这点之后，再根据算术来计算，获得了这种结论：无论如何，美国能从印度支那、菲律宾、日本、泰国和马来亚得到“近四百万士兵”。
    该杂志预先对“亚洲人防御部队”的美国组织者以及那些必须被包括在这支“部队”中充当美国炮灰的人指派了任务。它写道：“新的亚洲人军队的任务，将是地面战斗……。”至于美国，该杂志认为它对上述“部队”的贡献，将包括轰炸机、战斗机、军舰和军事代表团。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”所刊载的这篇文章显示出，美国侵略者虽然在朝鲜的战争赌博中失败了，但是他们还没有放弃他们在亚洲扩大战争的计划。不过他们要想利用他国人民充当这个战争中的炮灰。该杂志公然指出，这支“亚洲人防御部队”的组成，将“大大地减少不得不大批在该地作战的美国青年所受的危险”。
    该杂志认为，亚洲国家的“千百万正当战斗年龄的壮丁”必须为美国人的利益去战斗和送死。
