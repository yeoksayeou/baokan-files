Farmer Zheng Huai'en from Wujiazi Village, Eighth District, Fuxin County, Liaoxi Province, reported to the CCP Fuxin County Committee during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the transformation of village political power in the northeastern countryside in January 1952, accusing the village chief Ding Wanshan of losing his stance, shielding counter-revolutionaries, and engaging in corruption, as well as the Eighth District Party Committee Secretary Wang Dianlu of shielding Ding Wanshan and suppressing democracy. Wang Dianlu, Ding Wanshan, and others, in order to cover up their mistakes, fabricated many facts and used various crude methods to retaliate against Zheng Huai'en. During this period, although the Fuxin County leading organs sent investigation teams to the village twice, the participating cadres did not conduct thorough work, and the county leaders had serious bureaucratic work styles, failing to conduct serious research and analysis. Deceived by Wang Dianlu and others, they not only failed to support Zheng Huai'en's correct actions but instead considered Zheng Huai'en to be "falsely accusing cadres" and "overthrowing village political power," leading to the serious incidents of illegally arresting and detaining Zheng Huai'en twice, and driving Zheng Huai'en's younger brother, Zheng Huai'an, to his death. The matter lasted a total of ten months from its occurrence to its final resolution. Zheng Huai'en went to Fuxin County twice, appealed to the relevant organs of Liaoxi Province eight times, and wrote to Liaoxi Daily and Northeast Daily requesting support, wandering outside for three months, traveling more than 7,000 li. In mid-October of last year, Zheng Huai'en again wrote to Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government and personally went to the Northeast People's Supervision Committee to recount the whole situation. Finally, after in-depth investigations by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Supervision Committee of the Northeast People's Government, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, the People's Supervision Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, and relevant party and government organs of Fuxin County, the matter was resolved. The cadres who violated the law and neglected their duties have been punished accordingly.

Ding Wanshan, the village chief of Wujiazi Village, Eighth District, Fuxin County, originally came from a hired peasant background and once showed enthusiasm in the land reform struggle and joined the Communist Party of China. However, from 1950 onwards, he gradually became arrogant and complacent and embarked on the road of corruption and degeneration. He and Yang Qinghai, the village public security committee member, often ate and drank at the home of counter-revolutionary Ma Changlin (who had been executed during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries). At the beginning of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, he also said to Ma: "With me, Village Chief Ding, here, you, Old Ma, are okay!" and threatened the masses not to "talk nonsense." He was also very close to another counter-revolutionary, Zhao Weiyi. After Zhao was arrested, he personally delivered noodles and meat to Zhao. Usually, Ding Wanshan and Yang Qinghai never participated in labor production, relying entirely on assigning work to the masses for cultivation. He also embezzled more than one million yuan of the fruits of the land reform struggle and had raped women and beaten the masses, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the villagers. In January 1952, when the Northeast carried out the work of rectifying village political power, the masses exposed Ding Wanshan's illegal activities. The work team sent to the village by the People's Government accepted the opinions of the masses and presided over the election of village people's representatives. Out of more than 120 households in the village, Ding Wanshan only received six votes and had already lost the election. However, Wang Dianlu, the Secretary of the Eighth District Party Committee, because he often ate and drank with Ding Wanshan at the landlord's house, and because Wang Dianlu himself had shielded his father-in-law, the local tyrant and landlord Lü Wenzhong, hinting to the village cadres to change Lü Wenzhong's class status, and his own hands were not clean, he tried in every possible way to protect Ding Wanshan. He said to the work team that those who raised opinions were bad people who were "specifically targeting cadres," that "Ding Wanshan had some minor problems that had already been overcome," and that "Ding Wanshan could be re-elected." Based on Wang Dianlu's opinion, the work team forced the masses to elect Ding Wanshan as village chief again; and under Wang Dianlu's instruction, canceled the people's representative qualifications of farmers Zheng Huai'en, Ge Xianhui, and others. The villagers were very dissatisfied with this. Zheng Huai'en went to the CCP Fuxin County Committee to accuse Ding Wanshan of his illegal activities and also exposed Wang Dianlu's mistake of shielding Ding Wanshan. After Zheng Huai'en returned from the county, Yu Xianrui, the leader of the work team working in the village, interrogated Zheng Huai'en as to why he went to the county to raise opinions. Then, a meeting was held in the evening, falsely claiming that the puppet Baichang Bai Shusen (who committed suicide out of fear of punishment during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries) was "incited to death" by Zheng Huai'en, threatening Zheng Huai'en to "behave himself." Also, because Wang Dianlu had beaten the masses when he collected grain in Wujiazi Village in 1951 and had been anonymously accused, Wang suspected that Zheng Huai'en had made the accusation and had repeatedly threatened and satirized Zheng Huai'en in the name of checking the night. This time, Zheng Huai'en accused him of his mistakes, and he was even more dissatisfied, deliberately wanting to retaliate.

After receiving Zheng Huai'en's accusation, the CCP Fuxin County Committee criticized Wang Dianlu at a joint meeting of district party committee secretaries and sent Duan Zhihui, the secretary of the county committee, and Huang Xiuchun, the public security assistant of the district, and four others to Wujiazi Village to investigate. At this time, Yang Qinghai, the public security committee member of the village, and others fabricated charges against Zheng Huai'en, saying: "Zheng Huai'en wants to overthrow the village political power." They also falsely accused Zheng Huai'en of forcing Bai Shusen to accuse Village Chief Ding, but Bai did not dare to accuse him and hanged himself. In this way, Duan Zhihui, the secretary of the county committee, surrounded by district and village cadres, believed the facts fabricated by the village cadres, saying that Ding Wanshan's "mistake was not big" and that he "could still be the village chief." At that time, the masses had concerns and no one dared to tell the truth. After Duan Zhihui returned to the county from the investigation, he reported to Zhao Qi, the secretary of the county committee, that Zheng Huai'en had exaggerated the facts and should be dealt with, otherwise it would affect the morale of the cadres. Wang Dianlu also added from the side: "Zheng Huai'en specializes in targeting cadres and wants to overthrow the village political power." At that time, Zhao Qi, the secretary of the county committee (who was also acting as the county head because the county head was away on official business), blindly agreed with Duan Zhihui and Wang Dianlu's opinions and instructed Wang Dianlu to verify the facts clearly and that Zheng Huai'en could be arrested.

After Wang Dianlu returned to the village, he arrested Zheng Huai'en and personally tied him tightly and hung him on the beam. At the same time, he also summoned eleven other farmers who intended to accuse him to a meeting, mobilizing them to "clear their names." He threatened: "Have you seen Zheng Huai'en? Otherwise, you will be the same as him!" That night, Zheng Huai'en took the opportunity to escape overnight. The next day, Wang Dianlu was furious when he saw that Zheng had escaped, scolding the militiamen and giving them five days to find Zheng Huai'en. So the militiamen set up sentry posts at all intersections and searched everywhere, threatening Zheng Huai'en's younger brother Zheng Huai'an: "If Zheng Huai'en is not found in five days, you will all be guilty of the same crime." Zheng Huai'an did not know what serious crime Zheng Huai'en had committed and, unable to bear the pressure, hanged himself to death.

After Zheng Huai'en escaped, he went to the Liaoxi Provincial People's Supervision Committee to accuse them. The Provincial People's Supervision Committee ordered the Fuxin County People's Supervision Committee to conduct an investigation and asked Zheng Huai'en to go home and wait for processing. The Fuxin County People's Supervision Committee, together with the County Public Security Bureau, formed an inspection team consisting of Bu Ren, the section chief of the first section of the Public Security Bureau, and Sun Fengge of the County Supervision Committee, to go to Wujiazi Village for a second inspection. However, during the inspection, they still believed the facts fabricated by the district and village cadres and subjectively believed that Zheng Huai'en did have "false accusations," "overthrowing village political power" and other behaviors, and asked the Provincial People's Supervision Committee to approve the arrest. Before the Provincial Supervision Committee gave instructions, Huang Xiuchun, the public security assistant of the district, called the County Public Security Bureau again, falsely accusing Zheng Huai'en of having "illegal activities" after returning home. Yu Chengfu, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, advocated arresting him. After contacting Zhang Fenglin, the deputy director of the County Supervision Committee, and obtaining the consent of Zhao Qi, the secretary of the County Party Committee, they arrested Zheng Huai'en again and detained him for forty-eight days until the Liaoxi Provincial People's Supervision Committee discovered it and released him. During this arrest, Huang Xiuchun, the public security assistant of the district, handcuffed Zheng Huai'en. During the detention in the Public Security Bureau, Bu Ren also forced Zheng Huai'en to admit to "false accusations," "overthrowing village political power," and other crimes. Because Zheng did not admit it, he was handcuffed again. When Zheng Huai'en was finally released, he was forced to write a "repentance."

After Zheng Huai'en was released, Zhang Fenglin, the deputy director of the Fuxin County People's Supervision Committee, according to the instructions of the Provincial People's Supervision Committee, went to Wujiazi Village again to investigate and initially discovered the illegal activities of Wang Dianlu, Ding Wanshan, and others and reported them to the Provincial People's Supervision Committee. In order to handle the matter cautiously, the Provincial Supervision Committee, together with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, wrote a letter instructing the Fuxin County Committee of the CPC to investigate and deal with it. After the County Committee sent cadres to conduct an in-depth investigation, the basic situation was clarified. However, during the research and handling process by the relevant organs at the provincial and county levels, Yang Qinghai, the public security committee member of Wujiazi Village, was still secretly active in the village, attempting to attack Zheng Huai'en. Therefore, Zheng Huai'en still did not dare to go home and wandered outside for another three months. During this period, Zheng Huai'en went to the Provincial People's Supervision Committee four more times to appeal, but because the work of the Provincial Supervision Committee was slow, it was not handled in a timely manner. Finally, Zheng Huai'en wrote to Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government and went to the People's Supervision Committee of the Northeast People's Government to accuse them. After the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the People's Supervision Committee of the Northeast People's Government sent personnel to cooperate with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Fuxin County Committee and the Provincial and County People's Supervision Committees to conduct a review, the entire facts were clarified. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Supervision Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government gave the cadres who violated the law and made mistakes punishments respectively and, on November 1 last year, held a mass meeting in Wujiazi Village to publicly announce the decision to punish the cadres who violated the law and neglected their duties: Wang Dianlu, the former Secretary of the Eighth District Party Committee, and Ding Wanshan, the village chief of Wujiazi Village, were expelled from the Party, dismissed from their posts, and prosecuted according to law; Yang Qinghai, the public security committee member of Wujiazi Village, was dismissed from his post and prosecuted according to law; Huang Xiuchun, the public security assistant of the district (member of the District Party Committee of the CPC), was removed from his work within the Party and dismissed from his administrative post; Duan Zhihui, the secretary of the Fuxin County Committee, Zhao Qi, the secretary of the County Party Committee, Bu Ren, the section chief of the first section of the County Public Security Bureau, and Yu Chengfu, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, were given warnings respectively; Zhang Fenglin, the deputy director of the Fuxin County People's Supervision Committee, should conduct a profound self-criticism. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the CPC also ordered the Fuxin County Committee of the CPC to conduct a serious and conscientious self-criticism and write a written report. The Party and the People's Government praised and encouraged Zheng Huai'en, and the People's Government allocated one million yuan to compensate him for his economic losses. At the same time, condolences were given to the family members of the deceased Zheng Huai'an, and 1.5 million yuan was disbursed from the social relief fund to take care of their living difficulties and ordered the District People's Government to take appropriate measures to provide assistance in production.

    农民郑怀恩控告坏干部受到重重阻难
    郑怀恩层层上告坚持斗争到底终于得到胜利
    辽西省阜新县八区五家子村农民郑怀恩，在一九五二年一月东北农村进行镇压反革命改造村政权工作时，向中共阜新县委会检举了该村村长丁万山丧失立场、包庇反革命分子、贪污腐化等违法行为和第八区区委书记王殿禄包庇丁万山、压制民主等错误。王殿禄、丁万山等为掩盖自己的错误，竟捏造很多事实，使用各种蛮横手段，对郑怀恩实行报复。在这期间，阜新县领导机关虽两次派检查组到该村调查，但由于参加调查的干部工作不深入，以及县领导上有严重的官僚主义作风，没有认真研究分析，受了王殿禄等的蒙蔽，结果，不但没有支持郑怀恩的正确行动，反认为郑怀恩是“诬告干部”
    “推翻村政权”，以致造成两次非法逮捕扣押郑怀恩，逼死郑怀恩之弟郑怀安的严重事件。此事从发生到最后解决共历十个月。郑怀恩曾两次到阜新县，八次到辽西省的有关机关申诉，并写信给辽西日报、东北日报要求支持，在外流浪三个月，往返行程七千多里。到去年十月中旬，郑怀恩又上书东北人民政府高岗主席，并亲赴东北人民监察委员会历诉全情。最后经中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会、东北人民政府监察委员会、中共辽西省委纪律检查委员会、辽西省人民政府人民监察委员会及阜新县党政有关机关派人深入调查，才获得解决。违法失职的干部已分别受到处分。
    阜新县八区五家子村村长丁万山，原是雇农出身，在土地改革斗争中曾一度表现积极，并参加了中国共产党。但从一九五○年起就逐渐骄傲自满起来，走上腐化堕落的道路。他和村公安委员杨青海时常到反革命分子马长林（镇压反革命时已被处死刑）家里吃吃喝喝。镇压反革命运动开始时，还对马说：“有我丁村长在，你老马没关系！”并威吓群众“不能乱说”。他和另一个反革命分子赵维一也很要好。赵被捕后，他还亲自给赵送面送肉。平时，丁万山和杨青海一向不参加劳动生产，全靠向群众派工耕种。他还贪污过土地改革斗争果实一百多万元，并曾奸污妇女，打骂群众，引起该村群众普遍的不满。一九五二年一月，东北进行整顿村政权工作时，群众揭发了丁万山的违法行为。人民政府派到该村的工作组接受了群众意见，主持选举村人民代表。全村一百二十多户，丁万山仅得六票，已经落选。但是第八区区委书记王殿禄因为和丁万山经常一起在地主家吃吃喝喝，王殿禄自己也曾包庇他的岳丈恶霸地主吕文忠，暗示村干部给吕文忠改了成分，自己手脚不净，因此就多方包庇丁万山。他对工作组说：“提意见的人坏”，是“专门整干部”，“丁万山有点小毛病已经克服了”，“丁万山可以连选连任”。工作组根据王殿禄的意见，就强迫群众把丁万山又选为村长；并在王殿禄的授意下，取消了农民郑怀恩、葛显惠等人的人民代表资格。该村群众对此非常不满。郑怀恩即到中共阜新县委会控告丁万山的违法行为，同时也揭发了王殿禄包庇丁万山的错误。郑怀恩由县回来后，在该村工作的工作组组长于显瑞就逼问郑怀恩为什么到县去提意见。接着就在晚间开会，诬说伪保长白树森（镇压反革命时畏罪自杀）是郑怀恩给“煽动死的”，威胁郑怀恩“要老实些”。又因为王殿禄一九五一年在五家子村征粮时，曾打骂群众，被人匿名控告过，当时王就怀疑是郑怀恩控告的，曾多次以查夜为名，到郑家对郑怀恩威胁讽刺。这次郑怀恩检举他的错误，他就更加不满，蓄意要实行报复。
    中共阜新县委会接到郑怀恩的控告后，在区委书记联席会议上批评了王殿禄，并派县委秘书段致辉、区公安助理黄秀春等四人到五家子村调查。这时，该村的公安委员杨青海等就给郑怀恩捏造罪状说：“郑怀恩要推翻村政权。”又诬指郑怀恩逼白树森告丁村长，白不敢告，就上吊自杀了。就这样，县委秘书段致辉在区村干部包围下，相信了村干部捏造的事实，说丁万山“错误不大”，“仍可做村长”。当时群众有顾虑，没人敢说真话。段致辉调查回县后，即向县委书记赵琪汇报说，郑怀恩扩大事实，应当处理，否则影响干部情绪。王殿禄也从旁补充说：“郑怀恩专整干部，要推翻村政权。”当时县委书记赵琪（因县长公出，他还代理县长职务）竟盲目地同意段致辉和王殿禄的意见，并指示王殿禄把事实对证清楚，可以逮捕郑怀恩。
    王殿禄回村后，即把郑怀恩逮捕起来，并亲手把郑怀恩捆紧吊在梁上。同时他又召集其他有意控告的十一名农民开会，发动他们“洗清身”。并威胁说：“你们看见郑怀恩了吗？不然你们和他一样！”当晚，郑怀恩趁机连夜逃走。第二天，王殿禄见郑逃走，即大发雷霆，斥骂民兵，限五天把郑怀恩找回。于是民兵就在各道口布满岗哨，到处搜索，并威胁郑怀恩的弟弟郑怀安说：“如果五天找不回郑怀恩，一律同罪。”郑怀安不知郑怀恩究竟犯了什么大罪，被逼不过，就上吊自杀身死。
    郑怀恩逃出后，即到辽西省人民政府人民监察委员会控告，省人民监察委员会责成阜新县人民监察委员会进行调查，并让郑怀恩回家等候处理。阜新县人民监察委员会联合县公安局，由公安局一科科长布仁、县监委会孙凤阁等人组成检查组，第二次去五家子村检查。但他们在检查时，还是相信区村干部捏造的事实，主观地认为郑怀恩确有“诬告”、
    “推翻村政权”等行为，并请示省人民监察委员会批准逮捕。未等省监委会批示，区公安助理黄秀春又给县公安局打电话，捏告郑怀恩回家后又有“非法活动”。县公安局长于成福即主张予以逮捕。经与县监委会副主任张凤林联系，并得到县委书记赵琪同意，就又把郑怀恩逮捕起来，扣押了四十八天，直到辽西省人民监察委员会发现后，才予释放。这次逮捕时，区公安助理黄秀春曾给郑怀恩带手铐。在公安局扣押期间，布仁又强逼郑怀恩承认
    “诬告”、“推翻村政权”等罪，因为郑不承认，又给带上了手铐。最后释放郑怀恩时，还强迫郑写了“反省悔过书”。
    郑怀恩被释放后，阜新县人民监察委员会副主任张凤林根据省人民监察委员会的指示，又重新去五家子村调查，才初步发现王殿禄、丁万山等人的违法行为，并报告了省人民监察委员会。省监委会为了慎重处理，又联同中共辽西省委纪律检查委员会写信指示中共阜新县委会调查处理，经县委派干部深入调查，才把基本情况调查清楚。但在省、县各有关机关研究处理过程中，五家子村公安委员杨青海等仍在村里暗中活动，企图打击郑怀恩。因此郑怀恩仍不敢回家，又在外面流浪了三个月。在这期间，郑怀恩又曾四次到省人民监察委员会申诉，但因省监委会工作拖拉，仍未及时处理。最后郑怀恩又上书东北人民政府高岗主席，并到东北人民政府人民监察委员会控告。经中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会和东北人民政府人民监察委员会派员协同中共辽西省委、阜新县委纪律检查委员会和省、县人民监察委员会进行了复查，查清了全部事实。中共辽西省委纪律检查委员会和辽西省人民政府监察委员会即对违法和犯错误的干部分别给予处分，并在去年十一月一日，在五家子村召开群众大会，公开宣布对违法失职干部处分的决定：前八区区委书记王殿禄、五家子村村长丁万山被开除党籍，撤职法办；五家子村公安委员杨青海被撤职法办；区公安助理黄秀春（中共区委委员），党内撤销工作，行政上撤职；阜新县委会秘书段致辉、县委书记赵琪、县公安局一科科长布仁、县公安局局长于成福分别受到警告处分；阜新县人民监察委员会副主任张凤林应深刻进行检讨。中共辽西省委纪律检查委员会并责令中共阜新县委会严肃认真地进行检讨，并写出书面报告。党和人民政府对郑怀恩进行了表扬和鼓励，人民政府并拨款一百万元，补偿他在经济上的损失。同时对死难者郑怀安的家属也进行了安慰，并由社会救济费中支给一百五十万元，以照顾他们生活上的困难，并责成区人民政府采取适当办法，在生产上给予帮助。
