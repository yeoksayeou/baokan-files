The resource situation of the Daye Iron Mine in Hubei has been further understood after systematic exploration by the 429 Geological Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government last year. It is estimated that the resource survey work of the entire mining area can be basically completed by the end of this year.

In the eight months beginning in May last year, the 429 Geological Exploration Team conducted detailed geological surveys, precise geological surveys, trenching, geophysical prospecting, and drilling in six areas within the 1,000-square-kilometer Daye Iron Mine area. Their workload greatly exceeded the total geological workload in the more than 60 years since the Daye Iron Mine was first mined. During the entire period of Kuomintang rule, only three boreholes were drilled in the Daye area, while in the eight months of last year, the 429 Geological Exploration Team drilled more than 50 boreholes with a total depth of more than 9,000 meters. 30,000 cubic meters of trenching was carried out, nearly 3,000 mineral samples were collected, detailed surveys covered an area of 130 square kilometers, precise surveys covered an area of 20 square kilometers, and the geological survey tasks for 1952 were completed, partially or even overfulfilled.

This young geological exploration team is large in scale, complete in work types, and relatively well-equipped. The team is equipped with geological, geophysical prospecting, topographic surveying, and drilling teams, as well as a field laboratory, testing laboratory, and a repair factory dedicated to servicing drilling rigs; some important equipment such as electric balances, photoelectric colorimeters, polarizing microscopes, rock core splitters, slicing machines, grinding machines, magnetic balances, etc., are also available. Such a geological exploration team with complete work types and well-equipped equipment and the work they are carrying out is unprecedented in our country. They received tremendous help from the local people and Soviet experts in their work. Many young peasants also signed up to join the drilling team and worked hard to learn technology. Some became third-grade technicians after three months, strengthening the ranks of drilling workers. Soviet experts also personally went to the site to provide guidance in the hot weather of July, which greatly helped the progress of the exploration work.

The geological exploration task of the Daye Iron Mine is very large, but more than half of the exploration team members were originally amateurs. In order to improve technology and strengthen the team, the exploration team adopted the method of taking on a large number of apprentices in their work. Experienced geological personnel shouldered even greater responsibilities in this regard. They squeezed out time to write lectures, give classes, work tirelessly, and rarely rest. Most of the members of the geophysical prospecting team were young students who had just graduated from universities, colleges, or senior high schools. Under the guidance of veteran exploration personnel, they worked hard in field and indoor practice and finally successfully completed the national task. In the eight months, the exploration team actively improved working methods and operating techniques, so that the efficiency and quality of work were generally improved. For example, they established a contact and mutual assistance system between geological, geophysical prospecting, and surveying work types, so that the entire work could be closely coordinated and carried out rhythmically. The laboratory implemented assembly line operations, which increased work efficiency by more than two times. In terms of drilling, they learned the Soviet mud slurry automatic well-washing method, established a shift system, equipped core recorders, and leveled the foundation of the next borehole in advance, etc., which greatly improved the drilling progress and created a new record of drilling 5.3 meters every eight hours in magnetite. The total average core recovery rate in the entire mining area has also increased from the initial 20% to 60%. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    大冶铁矿区资源勘探工作成绩很大
    湖北大冶铁矿的资源情况，经过中央人民政府地质部四二九地质勘探队去年系统地勘探以后，已经进一步了解；预计到今年年底，全矿区的资源勘测工作可以基本完成。
    四二九地质勘探队在去年五月开始的八个月中，对大冶铁矿区一千平方公里内的六个地区进行了地质详查、地质精查、槽探、物理探矿、钻探等工作。他们的工作量，大大超过了大冶铁矿开采以来六十多年中地质工作量的总和。国民党整个统治时期，只在大冶区打过三个钻眼，而去年的八个月中，四二九地质勘探队就打了五十多个钻眼，总深九千多公尺。槽探作了三万立方公尺，采集矿样近三千个，详查面积一百三十平方公里，精查面积二十平方公里，完成了、部分并超额完成了一九五二年的地质勘测任务。
    这支年青的地质勘探队规模庞大，工种齐全，设备也较完善。全队配备有地质、物理探矿、地形测量、钻探等工作队，还有野外化验室、试验室和专门为钻探机服务的修理工厂；一些重要设备如电动天平、光电比色计、偏光显微镜、劈岩心机、切片机、磨片机、磁秤等，也都具备。这样工种齐全、设备完善的地质勘探队和他们所进行的工作，在我国是史无前例的。他们在工作中得到当地人民群众和苏联专家的巨大帮助。许多青年农民还报名参加钻探队，努力学习技术，有的在三个月后就成了三级技工，壮大了钻探工人的队伍。苏联专家则在七月炎热的天气里，也亲自到现场指导，大大地帮助了勘探工作的进行。
    大冶铁矿的地质勘探任务是很大的，但勘探队人员中，有半数以上的人原来都是外行。为了提高技术，壮大力量，勘探队采取了在工作中大量带徒弟的办法。有经验的地质人员们在这方面担负了更重大的工作，他们挤出时间编写讲义，上课，孜孜不倦，很少休息。物理探矿小队中绝大多数都是刚从大学、专科或高级中学毕业的青年学生，他们在老勘探人员指导下，努力进行野外和室内的实习工作，终于胜利完成了国家的任务。勘探队在八个月中积极改进工作方法和操作技术，使工作效率和质量普遍提高。例如，他们在地质、物理探矿、测量等工种之间建立了联系互助制度，使整个工作能紧密配合，有节奏地进行。化验室实行流水作业，使工作效率提高了两倍多。钻探方面，他们学习了苏联黄泥浆自动洗井法，订立了交接班制度，配备了岩心记录员，预先平好下一个钻眼的地基等，使钻探进度大大提高，创造了在磁铁矿内每八小时钻进五点三公尺的新纪录。全矿区总平均的岩心采取率也已由最初的百分之二十提高到百分之六十。 （据新华社讯）
