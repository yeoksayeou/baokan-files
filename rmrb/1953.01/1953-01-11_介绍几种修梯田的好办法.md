    Introducing Good Methods for Building Terraces

    Editor: Building terraces is a good method for conserving water and soil and increasing production. However, many farmers in mountainous areas still do not understand the significance of building terraces, lack experience and methods, and are afraid that building terraces is too labor-intensive. In this regard, farmers Han Yifu and Zhao Jinfu in Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province, have some good experiences. Now, I will introduce them for reference in various regions.

    When Han Yifu of Hanjialou Village, Third District, Wuzhai County, began mobilizing the masses to build terraces in early 1952, the vast majority of farmers in the village could not accept his opinion. For example, Yang Wu, a farmer in the village, said, "Why not plant on the good mature soil, but dig it all up into raw soil? Nothing will grow there." The members of the mutual aid team led by Han Yifu also said, "Building terraces is nonsense." In this situation, Han Yifu was not discouraged. He first took the lead in building terraces on his own land and assigned two surplus laborers from the team to help him, building a total of seven mu of terraces. He planted millet, and the millet grew very strong. In 1950, these seven mu of land only yielded one stone of naked oats. After being terraced, planting millet yielded seven stones. Han Yifu used this vivid fact to publicize the principle of "converting slopes into flat land, conserving water and fertilizing the soil" to the masses. Under his patient education and leadership, all the team members and the villagers finally recognized the benefits of building terraces. In 1952 alone, the Han Yifu mutual aid team built a total of 31 mu of terraces, and the villagers built a total of 340 mu of terraces.

    When the Zhao Jinfu mutual aid team in the Fourth District of Wuzhai County began to build terraces in 1952, they first built three mu by hand. After the completion, Zhao Jinfu called on everyone to continue building, but the team members said, "Our village is all hillside land, and it will be too labor-intensive to build by hand." Everyone was unwilling to continue building. At this time, Zhao Jinfu immediately led everyone to hold a meeting to find a shortcut. After research, everyone came up with a new method: using a wooden board three feet long and one foot wide, tied with a rope. First, loosen the soil in the field, then have one person press down on the wooden board and two people pull it from top to bottom. In this way, four workers can build one mu of terraces, greatly saving labor.

    Also, the Bu Guifeng mutual aid team in the Fourth District of Wuzhai County also created a method for building terraces. When they were building terraces on 30-degree slopes, they used three teams of oxen pulling plows to plow from the bottom up, while three people built the embankments below. Using this method, they can build three mu of terraces in one morning. Hou Yaoxian

### 介绍几种修梯田的好办法

    介绍几种修梯田的好办法
    编辑同志：修梯田是保持水土增加生产的好办法，但现在还有很多山区农民不了解修梯田的意义，缺少经验和办法，害怕修梯田太费工。在这方面山西五寨县农民韩义富、赵金福等都有些好经验，现在介绍出来供各地参考。
    五寨县三区韩家楼村韩义富一九五二年初开始发动群众修梯田时，村内绝大多数农民还不能接受他的意见，如该村农民杨五说：“好好的熟土不种，都掏成生土，屁也不会长的。”韩义富领导的互助组组员也说：“修梯田是胡闹。”在这种情况下，韩义富并不灰心。他首先带头在自己地里修，并抽出组内两个剩余劳动力来帮助他，共修成七亩梯田，种了谷子，结果谷子长得很壮。一九五零年这七亩地种莜麦只打了一石，修成梯田后，种谷子就打了七石。韩义富拿这个活生生的事实，向群众宣传了“坡地变平地，养水又养肥”的道理。全组组员和全村农民在他耐心教育和领导之下，终于都认识了修梯田的好处。一九五二年一年内，韩义富互助组共修梯田三十一亩，全村群众共修梯田三百四十亩。
    五寨县四区赵金福互助组一九五二年开始修梯田时，先用人工修了三亩，修完后，赵金福号召大家继续修时，组员们说：“咱村都是山坡地，都要用人工修太费工了。”大家都不愿继续再修。这时赵金福即领导大家开会找窍门。经过研究，大家想出了新办法：用三尺长一尺宽的一块木板，拴上绳子，先把地内土壤翻松，然后用一人把木板压住，二人拉上，由上而下的一层层往下刮。这样用四个工就可修成一亩梯田，大大节省了劳动力。
    又五寨县四区卜贵丰互助组也创造了一种修梯田的办法。他们在三十度的坡地上修梯田时，用三犋牛拉犁从下往上耕，同时用三个人在下面修畔。他们用这种办法，一上午可修成三亩梯田。侯耀先
