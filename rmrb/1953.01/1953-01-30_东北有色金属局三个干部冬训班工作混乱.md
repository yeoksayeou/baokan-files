The Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau's three cadre winter training classes are experiencing chaotic work, and the winter training is not very effective. Leading cadres of the Bureau should immediately conduct inspections and strengthen leadership.

The Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau's construction machinery, wage, and security cadre winter training classes all lacked sufficient preliminary preparation. All three training classes were delayed in starting due to uncertain address selections. The construction machinery training class moved from Harbin to Shenyang, and then from Shenyang back to Harbin. This back-and-forth movement not only wasted over 100 million yuan in transportation costs but also delayed political study time by twenty days. The wage and security training classes were originally scheduled to start in early November of last year, with a study period of two months, but relocation took up almost half the time. Students referred to them as "relocation training classes." At the same time, since the start of the training classes, staff have not been assigned, and cadre allocation is incomplete. The two political instructors of the construction machinery training class were transferred away, and the eight missing cadres had not been assigned by January 14th. The director of the training class was repeatedly called to the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau and the Harbin Company to discuss other work issues for ten days in early January, and many problems in the training class were left unresolved. After the political study of the wage training class ended, the director of the training class was transferred to the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau to take on a new job, leaving the training class without a responsible person. The next stage of professional study was left unmanaged, and they had to wait, which greatly affected the progress of learning.

Leading cadres of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau exhibit serious departmentalism in leading the work of the cadre winter training classes, further creating chaos in the winter training classes. The original decision of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry on the enrollment policy of the construction machinery training class was: to train 400 outstanding technicians and workers sent by the national heavy industry system, who would return to their original units after studying. However, leading cadres of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau disregarded the overall interests and failed to implement this decision from higher authorities, arbitrarily reducing the number of students sent by various units. For example, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Construction Engineering Company originally decided to send 75 students, but leading cadres of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau wanted the training class to accept only 30 people, and used 200 material clerks from the Bureau's affiliated engineering offices to fill the remaining slots. As a result, a group of technicians and skilled workers sent from various places were unable to attend the training class. This problem dragged on until the end of last year, when the Bureau finally withdrew 60 material clerks and accepted the students sent by the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Construction Engineering Company and other units, but this had already reduced the study time by almost a month.

The chaotic situation of the above three cadre winter training classes is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic work style of the leadership. The main responsible cadres, such as the director of the Harbin Company Office and the Party Committee Secretary of the Bureau stationed in Harbin, who directly lead the winter training work of the Bureau, did not go to the training class once from the beginning of preparation to the start of the classes, nor did they convene a meeting for this purpose. The leaders of the Bureau did not even know the name of the person in charge of the construction machinery training class. The Party Committee Secretary of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau stationed in Harbin did not even know where the construction machinery training class was located. This chaotic situation has seriously affected the learning effectiveness of the students. When the political studies of the wage and security training classes ended, a test was conducted, and the failure rate was as high as over 80%.

The Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau's organization of these three cadre training classes is of great significance. The Bureau faced many problems in construction in 1952. The efficiency of construction machinery was not fully utilized. The mechanical efficiency of the Fourth Engineering Office of Harbin was only 30%. Concrete mixers that could mix 40 cubic meters of concrete actually mixed less than 15 cubic meters; excavators often idled. Because workers lacked scientific knowledge, machinery frequently broke down and was repaired, affecting the progress of the project. In four months, only 40% of the project progress was completed, which was criticized by the Northeast Industrial Department. The problems in wages and security were also very serious. Wages were often paid incorrectly and delayed. The Sixth Construction Site once affected the competition because of this. In terms of security, the First Construction Site of the Fourth Engineering Office had five accidents in one day; the Second Construction Site had four workers fall from high altitudes in half a month. This shows that it is imperative to run the above three training classes well. The leadership of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau should quickly inspect the cadre winter training work in the Harbin area, strengthen leadership, and correct the current chaotic situation to ensure the successful completion of the winter training work.

    东北有色金属局三个干部冬训班工作混乱
    东北有色金属管理局哈尔滨地区干部冬季训练班存在很多问题，冬训工作收效不大。管理局领导干部应即进行检查，加强领导。
    东北有色金属管理局所办施工机械、工资、保安三个干部冬季训练班事先准备工作都不够充分。三个训练班都因为地址选择不定，推迟了开学时间。施工机械训练班从哈尔滨搬到沈阳，又从沈阳搬到哈尔滨，南北一搬，不仅浪费运输费一亿余元，而且延迟了政治学习时间二十天。工资与保安两训练班原定去年十一月初开学，学习时间两个月，但搬家就几乎占去了一半时间，学员们都说是“搬家训练班”。同时，训练班开学到现在，工作人员还没有派定，干部配备不全。施工机械训练班的两个政治教员被调走了，缺少的八名干部到一月十四日还没有配备。训练班主任在一月初的十天中间，接连三次被调到东北有色金属管理局和哈尔滨公司谈别的工作问题，训练班里很多问题无人解决。工资训练班政治学习结束后，训练班主任被调到东北有色金属管理局担任新的工作，训练班陷于无人负责状态，下一阶段的业务学习无人掌握，只好等待着，学习进程受了很大影响。
    东北有色金属管理局领导干部在领导干部冬训班的工作中存在着严重的本位主义思想，使冬训班的工作更加混乱。中央重工业部原决定施工机械训练班招收学员的方针是：培养全国重工业系统送来的优秀技术人员和工人四百名，学习后仍分送原单位工作。但东北有色金属管理局领导干部不顾整体利益，不执行上级这一决定，擅自缩减各单位送去的学员的名额。如中央重工业部建设工程公司原决定送去七十五名学员，但东北有色金属管理局领导干部要训练班只收三十人，余出来的名额，以该局所属工程处的二百名材料员来顶替。结果使各地送去的一批技术人员和熟练工人不能到训练班学习。这一问题一直拖到去年年底，该局才抽回材料员六十人，将中央重工业部建设工程公司等单位送去的学员收下，但已使学习时间几乎减少了一个月。
    上述三个干部冬训班的混乱情况，是和领导方面严重的官僚主义作风分不开的。直接领导该局冬训工作的管理局驻哈尔滨公司办公室主任和党委书记等主要负责干部，从开始筹备到开学，都没有到训练班去过一次，也没有为此召开过会议。管理局领导人甚至不知道施工机械训练班负责人的姓名。东北有色金属管理局驻哈尔滨公司的党委书记还不知道施工机械训练班设在那里。这种混乱情况，已严重影响了学员的学习效果。工资、保安两训练班政治学习结束时举行测验，不及格的竟达百分之八十以上。
    东北有色金属管理局举办这三个干部训练班，意义是很大的。该局在一九五二年施工中问题很多。施工机械效能没有充分发挥。哈尔滨第四工程处机械效率只发挥了百分之三十。可以搅拌四十立方公尺混凝土的搅拌机，实际搅拌不到十五立方公尺；挖土机经常睡觉。因为工人缺乏科学知识，机械常坏常修，影响了工程的进行，四个月只完成工程进度百分之四十，受到东北工业部的批评。工资和保安方面的问题也很严重。工资经常发错和拖延，第六工地曾因此影响过竞赛。在保安方面，第四工程处第一工地一天中曾发生五次事故；第二工地半个月中从高空掉下来四个工人。这说明办好上述三个训练班是刻不容缓的事情。东北有色金属管理局领导方面应迅速检查哈尔滨地区干部冬训工作，加强领导，纠正目前的混乱状况，以保证冬训工作的胜利完成。
