	Meeting with General Kim Il-sung
	October 26th of last year was the most memorable day of our Second Delegation to Korea for Comfort Visits during our visit to Pyongyang: we met with General Kim Il-sung.

	When General Kim Il-sung smiled and shook hands with us, I immediately recalled a happy time in 1951: It was a warm spring night, and the representatives of our First Delegation to Korea for Comfort Visits went to meet General Kim Il-sung. We walked across a small river with clear water, and a tall man in a wool overcoat and worker's cap was waiting for us at the edge of the village. He shook hands with all of us and said in fluent Chinese: "Comrades, you've worked hard!" Only then did people discover with delight: "It's him, General Kim Il-sung."

	In that meeting, General Kim Il-sung's steadiness, fortitude, composure, and enthusiasm left an indelible impression on us. This time, although it was also a brief meeting, the impression he gave us was even deeper. This leader of the Korean people seemed even younger, more optimistic, and happier. From him, we saw the great image of the Korean people, and we saw the Korean people's infinite confidence in the just war waged by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies.

	He received us in a quiet, spacious living room.

	"Comrades, please fill your glasses!" He enthusiastically raised his glass first. He said: "I first celebrate the great victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese armies fighting side by side for two years. Over the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers have aided us with blood and sweat, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. The behavior of the great immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao and the just actions of thousands of volunteer soldiers can only be produced under the shining light and education of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, this glass of wine should be for the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, and I wish him good health! Please everyone drink up!"

	General Kim Il-sung spoke in fluent Chinese throughout, which made us feel especially cordial. From his brief and heartfelt remarks, we further realized the depth and sublimity of the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples forged with blood.

	We raised our glasses to salute General Kim Il-sung. Ma Hengchang, a well-known industrial labor model in our country, toasted General Kim Il-sung on behalf of the workers of our country, and reported to General Kim Il-sung on the achievements of their production team in increasing production and resisting America and aiding Korea. General Kim Il-sung listened with a smile, and then shook Ma Hengchang's hand tightly and said: "I thank the Chinese working class for their assistance! I have long seen your name and your model deeds in the newspapers. I congratulate you! And through you, I pay tribute to the Chinese working class who are working hard on the production front!" Immediately afterwards, Zhang Benzhou, the father of Zhang Jihui, an agricultural labor model from Shandong and a hero of the Volunteer Air Force, toasted General Kim Il-sung on behalf of the Chinese peasants. He said: "We will work harder in the future to produce more grain to support Korea." General Kim Il-sung said: "The comrades of the Volunteer Army not only support us with blood, but also save on food and clothing to relieve the Korean disaster victims. We know that the grain is cultivated by the Chinese peasants with hard work, especially the agricultural labor models who take the lead in cultivating, which is even more hard work. Therefore, I also return the toast to you and pay tribute to the Chinese peasants!"

	We presented flags, gifts, and toasts to General Kim Il-sung. A harmonious, pleasant, and friendly atmosphere filled the entire living room. It was very late before we said goodbye to General Kim Il-sung. The image of this great leader and this warm scene left a deep impression on us. This is a symbol of unity and friendship, a symbol of victory.

	On Moranbong Hill
	In the morning, a female soldier of the Korean People's Army, Comrade Kim Jinzi, who was in charge of entertaining us, accompanied us to visit Moranbong Hill in Pyongyang. Our jeep sped north along Stalin Street, and then turned onto an asphalt road leading to Moranbong Hill. Soon, we arrived at this sacred place.

	The Liberation Tower, towering more than seventy feet high on Moranbong Hill, first came into our view. This tower was built by the Korean people to commemorate the great "August 15th" Liberation Day, to commemorate the Soviet army liberating them from the oppression of Japanese imperialism and making Korea free and independent. American aerial bandits have carried out crazy bombings of this peace tower, and even now there are still bullet marks around the tower; however, the tower still stands majestically on Moranbong Hill. Comrade Kim Jinzi said well: "Bombs cannot bring down truth and peace." She added: "I believe that after the war, the Korean people will definitely build another monument here to commemorate the Chinese People's Volunteers."

	Standing on Moranbong Hill, you can overlook Pyongyang. The calm and waveless Daedong River flows through the middle of the city, and the glow of the morning sun shines red in the river. The famous Stalin Street was built along the Daedong River, but now this street has been destroyed by American invaders. From here, the wreckage of those tall buildings can be seen clearly. The northwest district of Pyongyang, which was originally a commercial district, is bathing in the beautiful morning glow. I visited the market there when I came last year, but now it is a pile of rubble. The left bank of the Daedong River used to be the industrial area of Pyongyang, with many factories and hospitals. When we saw the remaining large chimneys, we immediately thought of our beloved motherland, the factories that are being built in our motherland, and the large chimneys that are smoking.

	Not far from the Liberation Tower, a group of children were sitting on the hillside attending classes. They are students from the Fourth People's Primary School in Pyongyang. The teacher, Zhuo Jinhua, told us: "The school was bombed by American planes, and some of the young students were also killed. The children have no school, so they run to the hillside to attend classes. When enemy planes come, they hide; when enemy planes leave, they continue to attend classes."

	Another group of children were working at the foot of the hillside, some digging soil and some carrying soil. At first, I thought they were digging air-raid shelters, but then Zhuo Jinhua told us that they were building a ball field. She said: "This is temporary. After the war, we will build many stadiums and cultural palaces."

	When we said goodbye to these lovely Korean children, they jumped up and shouted to us:

	"When you go back, please say that the Korean children send their regards to Chairman Mao!"

	"Greetings to the Chinese people!"

	"Greetings to the Chinese children!"

    平壤纪事

    会见金日成将军
    去年十月二十六日，是我们第二届赴朝慰问团访问平壤期间最值得纪念的一天：我们会见了金日成将军。
    当金日成将军微笑着和我们握手的时候，我立刻忆起了一九五一年的一个幸福时光：那是一个暖和的春夜，我们第一届赴朝慰问团的代表们去会见金日成将军。我们走过一条流水清清的小河，一位穿着呢大衣、戴着工人帽、身材魁伟的人正在村边迎接我们，他和我们所有的人握手，并且用熟练的中国话说：“同志们，辛苦了！”这时，人们才惊喜地发现：“是他，金日成将军。”
    在那次会见里，金日成将军的稳健、刚毅、沉着和热情，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。这一次，虽然也是一个短促的会见，但是他给我们的印象却更加深刻了。这位朝鲜人民的领袖越发显得年青、乐观、愉快。从他身上我们看到了朝鲜人民的伟大形象，看到朝鲜人民对于朝中人民军队所进行的正义的战争具有无限的信心。
    他在一个安静的宽大的客厅里接见我们。
    “同志们，请把酒斟满！”他热情地第一个举起杯来。他说：“我首先庆祝朝中两国军队并肩作战两周年所获得的伟大胜利。两年来，中国人民志愿军用血和汗援助了我们，表现了高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。像伟大的不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教的行为和千万个志愿军战士的正义行动，只有在马克思列宁主义光辉照耀之下、教育之下才能产生。因此，这杯酒应该为了毛泽东同志的思想的胜利，并祝他身体健康！请大家干杯！”
    金日成将军一直用熟练的中国话讲话，使我们感到格外亲切。从他的简短而情意深长的讲话里，我们更加体会到用鲜血结成的中朝人民友谊的深厚和崇高。
    我们举杯向金日成将军致敬。我国著名的工业劳动模范马恒昌一面代表我国工人向金日成将军敬酒，一面向金日成将军报告他们生产小组增加生产、抗美援朝的成绩。金日成将军一直微笑地听着，然后紧紧地握着马恒昌的手说：“我感谢中国工人阶级的援助！你的名字，你的模范事迹，我在报纸上早就看到了。我向你祝贺！并且通过你向在生产战线上辛勤劳动的中国工人阶级致敬！”紧接着，山东农业劳动模范、志愿军空军英雄张积慧的父亲张本周，代表中国农民向金日成将军敬酒。他说：“我们今后要更加努力生产，多打粮食来支援朝鲜。”金日成将军说：“志愿军的同志不但用血来支援我们，并且还节衣缩食来救济朝鲜灾民。我们知道，那些粮食是中国农民辛辛苦苦耕种的，尤其是农业劳动模范们带头耕作，更是辛苦。因此，我也回敬你，并向中国农民致敬！”
    我们向金日成将军献旗、献礼、敬酒，和谐、愉快、友爱的气氛充满了整个客厅。直到时间很晚了，我们才向金日成将军告别。这位伟大领袖的形象和这个热烈的场面，给我们留下了深刻的印象。这是团结友爱的象征，这是胜利的象征。
    在牡丹峰上
    早晨，朝鲜人民军的一位女战士、负责招待我们的金真子同志，陪同我们到平壤的牡丹峰去参观。我们的吉普车沿着斯大林大街向北急驰，然后又转到通往牡丹峰的一条柏油马路上前进。不久，我们就到达了这个圣地。
    耸立在牡丹峰上、高达七十余尺的解放塔，首先映入我们的眼里。这座塔是朝鲜人民为了纪念伟大的“八、一五”解放日，纪念苏联军队把他们从日本帝国主义的压迫下解放出来，使朝鲜获得自由和独立而建立的。美国空中强盗们曾对这个和平之塔进行了疯狂的轰炸，至今塔的周围还弹痕累累；然而这座塔依然雄伟地屹立在牡丹峰上。金真子同志说得好：“炸弹是炸不倒真理与和平的。”她又接着说：“我相信战争结束之后，朝鲜人民一定会在这里再修一个纪念塔，来纪念中国人民志愿军。”
    站在牡丹峰上可以俯视平壤。平静无波的大同江从这座城市中间流过，朝霞的光辉在江中闪耀着一片红光。有名的斯大林大街就是沿着大同江建筑的，如今这条大街已被美国侵略者炸坏了。从这里看去，那些高大建筑物的残骸可以看得清清楚楚。原来是商业区的平壤西北区，正浴在美丽的朝霞的光辉里，我前年来时还参观过那里的市场，可是现在那里却已是一片瓦砾了。大同江的左岸原来是平壤的工业区，有很多工厂和医院。我们看到那些残留下来的大烟囱，立刻想起我们可爱的祖国，想起我们祖国土地上那些正在建筑着的工厂，和那些正在突突冒烟的大烟囱来了。
    在离开解放塔不远的地方，有一群孩子坐在山坡上上课。他们是平壤市第四人民小学的学生，教员卓金花告诉我们：“学校被美国飞机炸毁了，有些小同学也被炸死了。孩子们没有学校了，就跑到山坡上来上课。敌机来了，他们就隐蔽起来；敌机走了，他们又继续上课。”
    另外一群孩子正在山坡下面劳动，有的挖土，有的背土。起初我以为是在挖防空洞呢，后来卓金花告诉我们那是在修筑一个球场。她说：“这是临时的，战后我们要修很多的体育场和文化宫。”
    当我们和这些可爱的朝鲜孩子们告别的时候，他们跳跃着向我们喊道：
    “你们回去就说朝鲜儿童问毛主席好！”
    “问中国人民好！”
    “问中国儿童好！”
