Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 13th: The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee convened the Southwest Region Economic Work Conference on Minority Areas in mid-December of last year to further develop the economy of minority areas in the Southwest Region and gradually improve the living conditions of minority peoples. The meeting summarized the economic work in minority areas over the past three years, studied the current economic situation in minority areas, and defined specific guidelines and tasks for further developing economic work in minority areas.

The meeting believed that due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, all aspects of economic work in minority areas have developed. In particular, material exchanges have initially improved the living conditions of minority peoples and strengthened ethnic unity. The meeting believed that the central task for the future is to develop production. It was also considered that doing a good job in minority economic work requires efforts in two aspects: First, developing agricultural production. The key issue in developing production in minority areas is how to overcome the difficulty of lacking agricultural tools and gradually change primitive farming methods. The meeting required that the problem of production tools in minority areas be basically resolved in about three years, while developing the production of tools, processing local products, and producing handicrafts needed for the daily life of local people, so that they complement the development of agricultural production. Second, vigorously carrying out trade work. The meeting believed that vigorously carrying out trade work can further promote material exchange between ethnic regions and stimulate production. The meeting studied trade issues by region. In border areas, the main task is to enrich material strength and strengthen market leadership. In minority areas close to the interior, the organization and leadership of relatively developed Tibetan merchants should be strengthened, so that they can unite well with state-owned trading organizations, develop various local trade businesses, and jointly run local enterprises. In minority areas without business habits, such as the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region in Xikang, state-owned trading companies in various places should set up more branches and vigorously help local people establish fixed markets and operate businesses. The meeting criticized the purely profit-seeking view and the one-sided mass view in carrying out trade work.

The meeting also discussed the issue of training minority economic work cadres, and required the economic departments in various minority areas to formulate specific plans for training minority economic work cadres.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 13th: The minority areas of Southwest China reaped a bumper harvest of crops last year. Eight counties in Yunnan Province, including Cheli, Fohai, and Nanqiao, increased rice production by more than 4 million jin; the Lu Mountain Miao Autonomous Region in Guizhou Province, despite suffering from various disasters, also increased production by 2 to 20 percent compared with the previous year; the grain production increase in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province exceeded the original plan by more than 21 percent; and various crops in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and other areas also generally increased in production.

Responding to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift, people of all ethnic groups in the Southwest Region launched a patriotic production increase movement in the spring of last year under the leadership of local people's governments, actively improving farming techniques and building water conservancy projects. People of all ethnic groups in Jinghua, Sichuan Province, united and helped each other, and successively renovated and newly built water dikes and ponds that could irrigate more than 6,800 mu of paddy fields, and turned 619 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Under the leadership of the work teams sent by the people's government, Yi farmers in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province organized nearly 400 production teams of about 20,000 people to participate in the production increase movement and began to improve farming methods, thereby achieving a bumper harvest. Encouraged by the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government's policy of rewarding wasteland reclamation and production, the people of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region cultivated more than 27,000 mu of land and sowed seeds last year alone, greatly increasing the region's grain output. In Danzhai, Guizhou Province, the Miao people, who used to farm with primitive farm implements, are now producing with plows, harrows, and hoes.

During the production campaign, the unity among the various ethnic groups became more consolidated as the people of all ethnic groups helped each other in their labor. In Geshibao Village, Daofu County, Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, there are more than 300 mu of dry land, which is surrounded by water on three sides, but in the past, the Tibetan and Han people in the area were not united, and had not irrigated it for decades, resulting in very poor harvests. Last year, due to the education received in the patriotic movement, the Tibetan and Han people jointly repaired a ditch, which allowed the 300 mu of dry land to be irrigated. In the Lu Mountain Miao Autonomous Region of Guizhou Province, when a pest infestation occurred, the Han people spontaneously organized teams of hundreds of people to catch insects and help the Miao people. When the fields of the Han compatriots dried up, the Miao farmers spontaneously helped the Han people carry water to irrigate the fields. In ethnic mixed areas, farmers of all ethnic groups have organized agricultural production mutual aid groups.

Due to the development of production, the living conditions of minority peoples have gradually improved. In Luohuo County, Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, more than 30 Tibetan families moved back during the spring plowing season last year because they produced grain and re-established their homes. The start of the cultivation of wheat, and the bumper harvest that ensued, in the Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County, Yunnan Province, eliminated the severe summer famine that had existed for many years. Many minority peoples who used to be unable to afford oil, salt, or clothing throughout the year now not only have enough food and oil, salt, but also purchase calico, rubber shoes, towels, and other daily necessities, and have added livestock and farm implements.

Now, people of all ethnic groups in the Southwest Region have begun plowing, hoeing, accumulating fertilizer, and other tasks, and are actively preparing for this year's agricultural production campaign.

### 西南区召开少数民族地区经济工作会议  去年西南各少数民族地区农作物普遍丰收

    西南区召开少数民族地区经济工作会议
    去年西南各少数民族地区农作物普遍丰收
    【新华社重庆十三日电】为进一步发展西南区少数民族地区的经济，逐步改善少数民族人民的生活状况，西南军政委员会财政经济委员会于去年十二月中旬召开了西南区少数民族地区经济工作会议。会议总结了三年来少数民族地区的经济工作，研究了少数民族地区当前的经济情况，并确定了进一步开展少数民族地区经济工作的具体方针和任务。
    会议认为：由于贯彻执行了毛主席的民族政策，少数民族地区的各项经济工作都有了发展，尤其通过物资交流，已初步改善了少数民族人民的生活状况，加强了民族团结。会议认为今后的中心任务是发展生产。并认为作好少数民族经济工作必须从两方面努力：第一，发展农业生产。发展少数民族地区生产的关键问题是如何克服缺乏农具的困难，逐渐改变原始的耕作方法。会议要求在三年左右，基本解决少数民族地区的生产工具问题，同时发展制造生产工具、进行土产品加工和当地人民生活必需的手工业品的生产，使其与发展农业生产相辅而行。第二，大力开展贸易工作。会议认为大力开展贸易工作才能进一步促进各民族地区的物资交流，并刺激生产。会议曾分别地区研究了贸易工作问题。在边疆地区主要是充实物资力量，加强对市场的领导；在接近内地的少数民族地区，应加强对商业比较发达的藏族商人的组织领导，使其与国营贸易机构很好地团结起来，发展当地的各种贸易业务和合办地方性的企业；在无经商习惯的少数民族地区，如西康凉山彝族自治区等地，各地国营贸易公司应多设分支机构，并大力帮助当地人民建立固定的集市与经营商业。会议批判了在开展贸易工作中的单纯营利观点与片面的群众观点。
    会议对培养少数民族经济工作干部问题，也作了讨论，要求各少数民族地区的经济部门作出培养少数民族经济工作干部的具体计划。
    【新华社重庆十三日电】西南区各少数民族地区去年农作物丰收。云南省车里、佛海、南峤等八县增产大米四百余万斤；贵州省鑪山苗族自治区虽遭受各种灾害，也比前年增产百分之二至二十；西康藏族自治区粮食增产量超过原计划的百分之二十一强；西康凉山彝族自治区和其他地区各种作物也普遍增产。
    西南区各族人民响应毛主席增产节约的号召，去年春天，在当地人民政府领导下，开展了爱国增产运动，积极改进耕作技术、兴修水利。四川省靖化各族人民团结互助，先后整修和新修的水堰、水塘，可灌溉六千八百多亩水田，并把六百一十九亩旱地变成水田。西康凉山彝族自治区的彝族农民，在人民政府派去的工作队领导下，组织了近四百个约两万人的生产小组，投入增产运动，并开始改进耕作方法，因而得到丰收。西康藏族自治区人民，在自治区人民政府奖励开荒生产政策的鼓舞下，仅在去年开荒下种的田地即达两万七千多亩，该区粮食产量已大大增加。贵州丹寨过去用原始农具耕作的苗民，现在也用犁、耙、锄头生产了。
    在生产运动中，由于各族人民在劳动中互相帮助，使各民族间的团结更加巩固。西康藏族自治区道孚县格西保村有三百多亩旱地，虽然三面靠水，但过去该地藏、汉两族人民不团结，几十年来从没灌过水，以致收成很坏。去年由于接受了爱国运动的教育，藏、汉人民共同修好了一条水沟，使三百多亩旱地得到了灌溉。贵州鑪山苗族自治区，在发生虫灾时，汉族人民自动组织了几百人的捉虫队，帮助苗族人民捉虫。汉族同胞的田干了，苗族农民自动帮助汉族人民挑水灌田。在民族杂居区内，各族农民都组织了农业生产互助组。
    由于生产的发展，逐渐改善了少数民族人民的生活状况。西康藏族自治区鑪霍县去年春耕时迁回来了三十多家藏民，因为生产了粮食，重新建立了自己的家园。云南碧江县傈僳族自治区因开始试种了小麦并得到丰收，使多少年来严重存在的夏荒一去不返。过去许多常年吃不上油盐、穿不上衣服的少数民族人民，现在不仅有足够的粮食和油盐，而且还购置花布、胶鞋、毛巾等生活必需品，并增添了耕畜和农具。
    现在，西南区各少数民族人民又开始了耕锄、积肥等工作，积极准备今年的农业生产运动。
