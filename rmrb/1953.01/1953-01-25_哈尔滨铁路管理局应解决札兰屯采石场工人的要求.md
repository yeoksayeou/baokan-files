    Harbin Railway Administration Should Address the Demands of Workers at Zhalantun Quarry

    To the Editor: The workers at our Zhalantun Quarry of the Harbin Railway Administration urgently request improvement in the quality of production tools. This would increase production and lower costs; however, the administrative leaders do not support this, and the problem cannot be solved. Our main production tool is the drill steel used for drilling holes. These drill steels used to be made of hexagonal steel. Hexagonal steel is soft, and the drill steels are thin and long, so they bend easily and can only drill holes one meter deep. If octagonal steel were used, it would be possible to drill holes one and a half meters deep. A blast using holes drilled with octagonal steel can collapse nine to ten cubic meters of rock; holes drilled with hexagonal steel can only collapse four cubic meters of rock. This means that our quarry's production efficiency is more than half lower with hexagonal steel than with octagonal steel. As a result, in the single item of explosives, from May to December 1952, more than 1,500 kilograms were wasted, equivalent to 115 million RMB. The quarry has repeatedly reported this situation to the higher-level administration and the trade union, requesting a change to octagonal steel. But they have delayed and failed to resolve it. Is it that octagonal steel cannot be purchased? No. Quarries such as Nianzishan and Jilin all use octagonal steel. Recently, Sun Yaodong, a worker at the quarry, went to the material factory to collect steel, and the people at the material factory even said: "Octagonal steel cannot be bought; we only have hexagonal steel, take it or leave it." Sun Yaodong said, "If you can't buy it, we'll buy it ourselves." But the material factory did not agree. In 1953, the country's economic construction requires even more stone. If this problem is not resolved, it will cause even greater losses to the country.
                                                 Chairman of the Zhalantun Quarry Trade Union, Harbin Railway Administration, Wang Wenzhong

### 哈尔滨铁路管理局应解决札兰屯采石场工人的要求

    哈尔滨铁路管理局应解决札兰屯采石场工人的要求
    编辑同志：我们哈尔滨铁路管理局札兰屯采石场的工人迫切要求改善生产工具的质量。这样可以提高生产，降低成本；可就是行政领导上不支持，问题不能解决。我们的主要生产工具是打眼用的钎子。这些钎子过去都是用六角钢。六角钢的质软而钎子细长，一打就弯，而且只能打一公尺深的眼；如果改用八角钢，就能打一点五公尺深的眼。使用八角钢打的眼一炮能崩九至十立方公尺石头；用六角钢打的眼只能崩四立方公尺石头。就是说，我们采石场用六角钢生产效率比用八角钢低一半以上。这样，仅炸药一项，自一九五二年五月到十二月，就多浪费了一千五百公斤，折合人民币一亿一千五百余万元。采石场把这一情况一再反映给上级行政及工会，要求改用八角钢。但他们拖延不给解决。是不是八角钢买不到呢？不是的。碾子山、吉林等采石场都用八角钢。最近采石场工友孙耀东到材料厂去领钢，材料厂的人还说：“八角钢买不到，要就是六角钢，不要就拉倒。”孙耀东说：“你们买不到我们自己去买。”但是材料厂又不答应。一九五三年国家经济建设更需要大批石材，如果这个问题不解决，将会给国家造成更大的损失。哈尔滨铁路管理局札兰屯采石场工会主席　王文忠
