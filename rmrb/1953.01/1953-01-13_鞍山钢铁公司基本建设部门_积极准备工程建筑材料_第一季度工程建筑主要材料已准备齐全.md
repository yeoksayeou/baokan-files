Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th. The capital construction department of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel) is actively preparing a large number of engineering construction materials to supply large-scale industrial construction. The main materials needed for engineering construction in the first quarter of this year have been fully prepared.

In order to ensure the timely supply of various materials needed for engineering construction, Ansteel's capital construction department compiled a plan for ordering goods from abroad and materials requiring national allocation as early as September last year, and stored materials that are frequently used this year but are difficult to purchase temporarily. Now, from morning to night every day, a large number of trains fully loaded with materials transported from all over the country or abroad arrive at Ansteel. Electrical and steam materials, non-ferrous metal materials, tools, cement, mechanical oil, screws and rivets, and other special material warehouses are fully stocked. In order to ensure timely supply and strengthen material management, warehouse management departments take out some of the complex and precise materials from the material boxes and place them on shelves with glass and printed cloth covers. In this way, materials can be quickly issued when the construction site claims them; and it can prevent materials from getting damp or dusty.

Ansteel's material preparation work this year is carried out under the guiding principle of "facing the project" and "changing from passive to active". In the situation where construction drawings could not be designed early, the Materials Department first sent various special material teams to take the initiative to investigate the project situation at the design, planning, and engineering companies, and even went up the mountains to find exploration teams. Then, based on the workload of each capital construction unit in 1953 and the budget quota for construction projects, as well as the actual experience of material consumption in the past year, it served as the basis for formulating the material supply plan. At the same time, the Ansteel Materials Department also sent people to various equipment companies in the Northeast region to inspect their existing goods, and requested catalogs and drawings of material products manufactured by local and national factories. This will gradually change the past situation of blind procurement, so that this year's material preparation plan is close to the actual needs of various units, and further achieve local sourcing to save a lot of freight and foreign exchange. The Ansteel Materials Department also carried out warehouse cleanup work, using the previously stagnant materials for this year's engineering construction.

In order to advance from simple material supply to material management, the material supply work of Ansteel's capital construction department has also newly established many scientific systems. For example, each engineering unit must make material plans on a monthly and quarterly basis. This will gradually change the supply system thinking of "one hand opening the list, one hand asking for materials" and the unplanned situation of the engineering department, so as to prepare in time, actively check, and gradually establish the idea of economic accounting. In addition, the warehouse management department has also simplified the acceptance, issuance, and other procedures, and established a system for directly delivering large quantities of materials from other places to the construction site, which is convenient for supply and reduces a lot of freight.

### 鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门  积极准备工程建筑材料  第一季度工程建筑主要材料已准备齐全

    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门
    积极准备工程建筑材料
    第一季度工程建筑主要材料已准备齐全
    【新华社鞍山十二日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司（以下简称鞍钢）基本建设部门正积极准备大量工程建筑材料供应大规模的工业建设。今年第一季度工程建筑所需要的主要材料已经准备齐全。
    为了保证及时供应工程建筑需要的各项材料，鞍钢基本建设部门早在去年九月，就编制了向国外订货和需要国家调拨的材料计划，并贮备了今年经常使用而一时难以购制的材料。现在，每天从早到晚，都有大批火车满载着从全国各地或国外运来的材料到达鞍钢。电汽材料、有色金属材料、工具、水泥、机械用油、螺丝和铆钉等各专材仓库，都已贮备满仓。为了及时供应和加强材料管理，仓库管理部门把规格繁杂而精密的材料，从材料箱内取出一部分放到装有玻璃和花布罩的货架上。这样，工地领料时就能迅速发出；并可防止材料受潮湿或落上灰尘。
    鞍钢今年的材料准备工作，是在“面向工程”、
    “从被动争取主动”的指导方针下进行的。材料处在施工图还不能及早设计出来的情况下，曾首先派出各种专材小组，主动到设计、计划、各工程公司，甚至上山找钻探队调查工程情况，然后根据一九五三年各基本建设单位的工作量和建筑工程概算定额，以及去年工程用料的实际经验，作为制订材料供应计划的根据。同时，鞍钢材料处又派人到东北区各器材公司，巡察了他们现存的货色，并函索了当地和全国各工厂所制造的材料产品目录和图样。这样就可以逐渐改变过去盲目采购的情况，使得今年的材料准备计划和各单位实际需要的数字相接近，进一步作到就地取材，以节省大量的运费和外汇。鞍钢材料处还进行了清理仓库的工作，把过去呆滞的材料，用于今年的工程建筑。
    为了从单纯的材料供应进到材料管理，鞍钢基本建设部门的材料供应工作，还新建立了许多科学的制度。如各工程单位必须按月按季作出材料计划，这样，将逐步改变工程部门那种“一手开清单，一手要材料”的供给制思想和没有计划的状况，做到及时准备，主动检查，逐步树立经济核算思想。此外，仓库管理部门又简化了验收、领发等手续，建立了外地运来的大批材料直送工地的制度，既便于供应又减少了大量运费。
