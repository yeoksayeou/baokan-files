    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Petőfi Bridge in Hungary
    On November 22, 1952, the opening day of the Third Hungarian National Peace Congress, a new bridge over the Danube River in Hungary was completed and officially opened to traffic. This was a gift from the Hungarian workers to the congress and a new contribution to the cause of peace.
    Seven years ago, in the spring when Hungary was first liberated, there was not a single complete bridge over the Danube River in Hungary that could be used for traffic; all the bridges had been destroyed by the German fascist bandits before their retreat. The broken steel frames and beams lay in the water like piles of tangled firewood. The destruction caused by the war left scars on the beautiful Danube and Budapest.
    However, the liberated Hungarian people, with their strong will and redoubled efforts, engaged in the arduous task of reviving and building their motherland. In the past seven years, they have built seven large bridges over the Danube with their own hardworking hands. To eternally commemorate their great patriot and talented poet, Sándor Petőfi, the Hungarian people named the new steel bridge completed last November 22nd the Petőfi Bridge.
    Building the Petőfi Bridge on the rapidly flowing Danube River was a huge project. Hungarian workers experienced numerous difficulties and dangers in this work, fully demonstrating their love for the motherland and their heroic spirit of peaceful labor.
    The Petőfi Bridge is located at the southern end of the center of Budapest, where there used to be a narrower old bridge, but it was destroyed in the war. According to the engineering design, the Petőfi Bridge is 515 meters long, but it can only be supported by two stone piers, and the construction period is only one and a half years, half the construction time of the old bridge. In order to drive fewer piles during bridge construction and avoid hindering Danube traffic, the bridge pavement project was not started from the river bank but extended to the left and right from the large stone piers that had already been built. This construction method requires highly precise technology and effective machinery and equipment to ensure that the steel beams extending to both sides of the pier are as balanced as a balance, otherwise the pier and the bridge piles used during construction will bear too much weight due to tilting. When installing steel beams, the workers adopted a segmented operation method. Unlike the construction of the old bridge, where parts were shipped in batches and assembled temporarily, many steel beams 16 to 32 meters long and weighing 50 to 100 tons were prefabricated on the shore, and then hoisted to the piers for installation by cranes.
    Last spring, workers began construction of the second bridge pillar for the project. When the wooden piles had been driven into the riverbed but had not yet stabilized, the Danube River level suddenly rose during the spring flood. The torrential river water surged from the upper reaches. If the bridge piles could not be reinforced quickly at that time, they would immediately be in danger of being washed away.
    At this time, several excellent divers volunteered to undertake this arduous and seemingly impossible task. They tied many things to their bodies to increase their weight to more than 200 kilograms, and then clung to the bridge piles and dived to the bottom of the river. They fought the flood for two days and finally reinforced the wooden piles, which allowed the entire bridge construction project to proceed smoothly. Hungarian workers are using such a heroic fighting spirit to build their motherland.
    Today, the Petőfi Bridge stands firmly and majestically across the Danube River. Vehicles travel back and forth on the bridge like shuttles, and pedestrians can lean on the bridge railings in the evening when the sun sets to look at the panoramic view of the Danube and the colorful clouds on Freedom Mountain. People have already enjoyed the fruits of their labor. Petőfi once expressed such a great ideal during his lifetime:
    I yearn for the days of bloodshed,
    It will destroy the old world,
    On the ruins of the past,
    Build a brand new world.
    Now, Petőfi's tens of thousands of sons and daughters have realized his ideals. The Hungarian people have used their hands to build a "brand new world" on the ruins and are living a peaceful and happy new life. (With picture)

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    匈牙利的裴多菲桥
    一九五二年十一月二十二日，匈牙利第三届全国和平大会开幕的那一天，匈牙利境内的多瑙河上又有一座新的大桥建筑完工并正式通行了。这是匈牙利工人给大会的礼物，也是他们对和平事业的新贡献。
    在七年前的春天，当匈牙利刚解放的时候，匈牙利境内的多瑙河上没有一条完整的可以通行的桥梁；所有的桥梁都被德国法西斯匪徒在溃逃前破坏了。折断了的钢架和钢梁，像一堆堆的乱柴那样倒在水里。战争造成了破坏的景象，给美丽的多瑙河和布达佩斯留下了斑斑伤痕。
    但是，解放了的匈牙利人民以坚强的意志和千百倍的努力来从事复兴与建设祖国的艰巨工作。七年多来，他们已经用自己勤劳的双手，在多瑙河上建起了七座大桥。为了永恒纪念他们伟大的爱国者、天才的诗人裴多菲·山陀尔，匈牙利人民把在去年十一月二十二日完工的这座新的钢桥命名为裴多菲桥。
    在流水湍急的多瑙河上，建造斐多菲桥是一项巨大的工程，匈牙利工人们在这个工作中历尽困难和险阻，充分表现了他们对祖国的热爱与和平劳动的英勇气概。
    斐多菲桥座落在布达佩斯市中心的南端，在那里，从前本有一座比较窄一些的旧桥，但在战争中被破坏了。按照工程的设计，裴多菲桥长达五百十五公尺，但却只能用两个石桥墩来支持，而且建筑期限只有一年半，比那座旧桥的建筑时间减少一半。为了在造桥时少打桥桩，以免妨碍多瑙河的交通，桥梁的铺架工程不是从河岸开始而是在已经建造好了的大石桥墩上向左右两旁伸展进行的。这种建造方法需要高度精确的技术和有效的机器设备，务使向石墩两旁伸展的钢梁像天平那么平衡，否则就会因倾斜而使桥墩与建筑时所用的桥桩担负过多的重量。在装置钢梁时，工人们采用了分段作业的方法，不像建造旧桥那样把零件分批运来临时装配，而是预先在岸上造好许多长十六至三十二公尺、重五十至一百吨的钢梁，然后再用起重机把它们吊运到桥墩上去安装。
    去年春天，工人们开始建筑第二个工程用的桥柱，当木桩已打入了河底，但尚未稳固的时候，春汛期间的多瑙河的水位突然高涨了。奔腾湍激的河水自上游汹涌而来，当时如果桥桩不能赶紧加固，它们就立刻有被冲断的危险。
    这时候，几个优秀的潜水工人自告奋勇，愿意担负这一个艰巨的看来没有把握完成的任务。他们在身上绑了许多东西，把体重增加到二百多公斤以上，然后紧扶着桥桩潜入河底。他们和洪水搏斗了两天，终于把木桩加固了，这样，就使得整个桥梁的建造工程顺利进行。匈牙利工人们就是用这样英勇的战斗精神来建设他们的祖国的。
    今天裴多菲桥已稳固地雄伟地横跨在多瑙河上了，车辆已在桥上穿梭似地来往行进，行人们可以在夕阳西下的傍晚凭着桥栏眺望多瑙河的远景和自由山上的彩霞，人们已享受到了自己的劳动成果了。裴多菲在生前曾经表示过这样的伟大理想：
    我渴望着流血的日子，
    它会将旧的世界毁坏，
    在那过去的废墟上，
    建设起崭新的世界。
    现在，裴多菲的成千成万的儿女们已经实现了他的理想，匈牙利人民已经用他们的双手在废墟上建设起了一个“崭新的世界”，过着和平、幸福的新生活了。（附图片）
