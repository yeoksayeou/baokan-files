The alignment survey work for the Lanzhou to Jiehe (25 kilometers west of Wuwei) section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was completed on schedule on December 11, 1952, with the enthusiastic assistance of people of all ethnic groups along the route. This section of the line is 330 kilometers long.

In April 1952, the employees of the various detachments of the Lanzhou-Suzhou Survey and Design Headquarters began surveying on the Hexi Corridor and enthusiastically launched a production increase and economy campaign, proposing to "resolutely overcome all natural difficulties and complete the survey tasks on schedule while ensuring quality." Employees of the First Detachment consistently conducted fixed-point measurement work on the Wushaoling Mountains in the severe cold of around minus 20 degrees Celsius, increasing the daily progress from 2 kilometers per worker to 3.04 kilometers. In their work, the employees of each detachment displayed initiative and creativity. Comrade Wang Lin of the traverse group found that single-mirror traverse surveying was slow, so he researched a double-mirror traverse method, saving time in repeatedly adjusting the mirror, increasing the progress from a maximum of 4 kilometers per day to 12 kilometers.

During the survey work, enthusiastic support was received from the masses along the route. When the drilling team was drilling at a certain location on the Wushaoling Mountains, the location was 20 *li* away from the highway, and trucks fully loaded with machinery could not enter the valley. After more than 200 Tibetan men and women near Jile Township in the Tianzhu Autonomous Region learned of this, they immediately mobilized all the men and women and carts in the township to transport machinery for the drilling team. The Tianzhu Autonomous Region People's Government also organized a team of more than 200 Tibetan men and women, who traveled from 20 to 30 *li* away to a certain location to build roads for the drilling team free of charge. A 53-year-old Tibetan woman, Jia Chaina, said, "Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, 100 *jin* of wool could only be exchanged for three bricks of tea. After liberation, 100 *jin* of wool can be exchanged for more than 30 bricks of tea. Now Chairman Mao has sent people to build railways for us, and in order to make our future life better, we should do this."

After the Fifth Detachment of the Lanzhou-Suzhou Survey and Design Headquarters completed the fixed-point measurement work from Wuwei to Yongchang, Lu Yufan, a local farmer, proposed a new line. He said that the originally measured section of the road from Yongchang to Zhangye was not good, and it would be better to go from Wuwei through Jiehe to Zhangye, which would be flatter. After everyone discussed it at a technical meeting, it was decided to survey a comparison line for this section of the road. The survey results showed that the route mentioned in farmer Lu Yufan's suggestion would shorten the route by 13 kilometers compared to the originally selected route. Calculated solely on the basis of railway construction costs, this could save the motherland 40 billion yuan.

    兰新铁路兰州界河段完成定线测量工作
    农民陆毓藩建议改变线路仅工费一项即为国家节省四百亿元
    兰新铁路兰州至界河（武威西二十五公里）的定线测量工作，在沿线各族人民的热烈协助下，已于一九五二年十二月十一日按期完成。这段线路共长三百三十公里。
    兰肃勘测设计总队各分队职工一九五二年四月间就在河西走廊上开始勘测，并热烈展开增产节约生产竞赛运动，大家提出：“坚决克服一切自然困难，在保证质量的要求下，按期完成勘测任务”。第一分队职工始终在零下二十度左右严寒的乌鞘岭上，进行定测工作，从每个工每天进展二公里提高到三点零四公里，在工作中各队职工都发挥了积极性与创造性。导线组王霖同志发现单镜打导线测量进度很慢，便研究出双镜打导线的办法，节省反复摆镜子的时间，由原来最高每日进展四公里提高到十二公里。
    在勘测工作中，得到沿线群众的热烈支援。钻探队在乌鞘岭上某地钻探时，该地离公路二十华里，满载机器的汽车开不进山谷中去。天祝自治区极乐乡附近二百多藏民知道后，立即发动了全乡男女藏民和大车，替钻探队运输机器。天祝自治区人民政府并组织了一支二百多男女藏民的队伍，从二、三十里以外赶到某地，义务地给钻探队修筑公路。五十三岁的藏民老妈妈加柴娜说：“解放前由于国民党反动派统治，一百斤羊毛才换三块砖茶，解放后一百斤羊毛可换三十多块砖茶了，现在毛主席又派人来给我们修铁路，为了使今后的日子过得更好，我们应该这样做。”
    兰肃勘测设计总队第五分队在完成了由武威到永昌一段的定测工作后，当地农民陆毓藩又提出一条新线，他说经过永昌到张掖原测那段路不好，不如从武威出来经过界河再到张掖那段平坦，后经大家在技术会议上研究，决定勘测这段路的比较线。勘测结果，农民陆毓藩的这个意见中所说的线路比原来所选的线路要缩短十三公里。仅按修建铁路工费计算，就可替祖国节省四百亿元。
