    People Across the Country Write Letters to Report Mineral Deposits

    Since this newspaper published news and an editorial on December 19th last year regarding the National Geological Work Plan Conference, which called for the launch of mass mineral reporting work, readers from all over the country have written to report on the mineral deposits they know of or have discovered. As of the 6th of this month, we have received a total of twenty-one letters of this kind. These letters report on thirty-seven mineral deposits. The types of mineral deposits include gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, petroleum, mica, and marble, etc. These letters come from nearby provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi, and from more distant provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang, as well as from Gansu and Fujian. The letter writers include workers, students, government employees, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and convalescents. This shows that mineral reporting work has initially attracted the attention of the broad masses of the people.

    These letters fully reflect the patriotic enthusiasm of the people who care about the economic construction of the motherland. For example, Ding Riqiang of the Military Supplies Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, in a letter reporting on mineral deposits in Laiyang and Rushan counties in Shandong Province, described it this way: "After seeing the news about the Geological Work Plan Conference in the newspaper, I felt very excited. This news means that the motherland's infinite treasures will no longer sleep underground from now on. I care about the construction of the motherland as much as I care about my parents and brothers, so I am willing to quickly tell you all the little things I know for the reference of the glorious geological workers." Shi Yingjie, a student at a certain school of the People's Liberation Army, was lying ill in a sanatorium. After seeing the newspaper publish "Carry out mass mineral reporting work," he said: "As a people's soldier, not only must I defend the motherland's large-scale economic construction, but also excavating the motherland's underground mineral deposits is my duty." Therefore, he wrote to this newspaper while ill, reporting a certain mineral deposit in his hometown of Cixi, Zhejiang. For the convenience of geological personnel's investigation, he also recommended his relatives Han Weikun and Lou Daowen as guides. Li Dianxiong, an employee of the Dong Mine in Fangshan, Beijing, wrote to report that there are iron mines in his hometown, and said that his sixty-year-old uncle, Li Huaxing, "knows the mine in great detail and is willing to do his best to assist if an investigation is needed." Li Runtang, a cadre of the Shanxi Military Region Cadre School, wrote to report that there are coking coal mines in his hometown of Echeng County, Hubei, and attached a sketch map of the mine. This provides convenient conditions for investigators and surveyors. Wang Yi of the Hebei Advanced Studies College wrote to report on the valuable mineral deposits in Minxian and Zhangxian counties in Gansu, and also suggested that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government instruct geography teachers in various schools to consciously teach students to report minerals, and at the same time, when teaching about the motherland's mineral resources, teach students general knowledge of how to recognize the main ores. In this way, a force will be added to the geological front of the motherland.

    The great concern of the broad masses of the people for the economic construction of the motherland is of great benefit to discovering the motherland's underground resources and carrying out large-scale exploration work. Now, we have forwarded these letters to the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, and requested that they conduct research or exploration separately according to the actual situation, and publish a comprehensive response to the research results in the newspaper.

### 各地群众纷纷来信报矿

专栏：读者来信综述

    各地群众纷纷来信报矿
    去年十二月十九日本报发表了关于全国地质工作计划会议的新闻和社论，提出开展群众性报矿工作的号召后，各地读者纷纷来信报告他们所知道的或发现矿藏的情形。截至本月六日止，我们共收到此类来信二十一封。其中报告的矿藏达三十七处。矿藏的种类包括金、银、铜、铁、煤、石油、云母和大理石等。这些信，近的来自河北、河南、山东、山西，稍远的来自湖南、湖北、浙江，也有来自甘肃和福建。写信的人有：工人、学生、机关工作人员、人民解放军和休养员。由此可见，报矿工作已经初步引起广大人民群众的注意。
    这些来信充分反映了人民群众关心祖国经济建设的爱国热忱，如：人民革命军事委员会军需部丁日强在报告山东省莱阳、乳山等县有矿藏的来信中，是这样叙述的：“看到报上登载地质工作计划会议的消息后，心里十分兴奋。这一消息意味着祖国无穷的宝藏从今以后不再长睡在地下了。我像关怀自己的父母兄弟一样关怀着祖国的建设，因此我愿意把我所知道的点滴情况都赶紧说出来，供光荣的地质工作者们参考。”人民解放军某学校学员施英杰正卧病在休养所，见到报上登载“开展群众性报矿工作”后，他就说：“作为一个人民战士，不但要保卫祖国大规模的经济建设，而且发掘祖国地下的矿藏也是我应尽的责职。”因此他抱病给本报写信，报告他家乡浙江慈溪的某种矿藏。为了地质人员调查方便，他并且推荐他的亲戚韩维锟、楼道文作为向导。京西房山东矿职工李殿雄来信除报告他的家乡有铁矿外，并说他的六十岁的叔父李化兴“对该矿知之甚详，如果需要勘察的话，他愿尽力协助。”山西军区干部学校李润堂来信报告他故乡湖北鄂城县有焦煤矿的同时，并附来该矿略图。这就给调查勘察人员提供了便利的条件。河北省进修学院王毅来信报告甘肃岷县、漳县的宝贵矿藏后，还建议中央人民政府教育部指示各学校的地理教员有意识地教导学生报矿，同时在讲祖国的矿物资源时，应教给学生认识主要矿石的一般常识。这样在祖国地质战线上就会增加一批力量。
    广大人民群众这样关心祖国的经济建设事业，这对发现祖国的地下资源，开展大规模的勘察工作是有很大的好处的。现在，我们已把这些来信转给中央人民政府地质部，请他们根据实际情况分别进行研究或勘察，并将研究结果在报上作综合答复。
