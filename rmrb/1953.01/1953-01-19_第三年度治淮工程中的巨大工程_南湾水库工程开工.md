A huge project in the third year of the Huai River harnessing:
	Nanwan Reservoir Project Begins Construction

Of the six valley reservoirs to be built in the third year of the Huai River harnessing project, the Nanwan Reservoir on the Shi River, a tributary of the upper reaches of the Huai River, is one of them. After a year of preparation, the construction of the Nanwan Reservoir project officially began on December 18th of last year; the entire project is expected to be basically completed by the end of this year, and water storage will begin before the flood season next year.

The Nanwan Reservoir is being built in Nanwan Village, southwest of Xinyang County, Henan Province. A 721-meter-long earth dam will be built between the valleys on both sides of the Shi River. In addition, a water conveyance tunnel and a branch tunnel connecting the water conveyance tunnel and the power plant will be built. The Nanwan Reservoir is a multi-objective, beneficial project. After the reservoir is completed, the storage capacity will reach 910 million cubic meters, which can control mountain floods in the upper reaches of the Shi River during the flood season, and protect 300,000 mu of farmland along the Shi River and the Huai River from floods; in the dry season, 6.5 cubic meters per second of water can be released to irrigate farmland. A power plant will also be built next to the reservoir, guaranteeing an annual supply of 9.07 million kilowatt-hours of electricity; the tailwater from power generation can also be used to improve navigation in the lower reaches of the Shi River and increase the amount of irrigation water in the main stream of the Huai River. The construction of the Nanwan Reservoir is divided into three construction phases. The current key projects are excavating the dam foundation and excavating the water conveyance tunnel.

    第三年度治淮工程中的巨大工程
    南湾水库工程开工
    第三年度治淮工程中要修六座山谷水库，淮河上游支流溮河上的南湾水库是其中的一座。经过一年的准备，修建南湾水库工程已于去年十二月十八日正式动工；全部工程预计可在今年底基本完成，明年汛前开始蓄水。
    南湾水库修建在河南省信阳县西南的南湾村。在溮河两岸的山谷间，修筑一条长七百二十一公尺的拦河土坝。另修建一个输水隧洞和一个接连输水隧洞和电厂的支洞。南湾水库是一个多目标兴利的工程。水库修成后，蓄水量达到九亿一千万立方公尺，洪水期内可以控制溮河上游山区的山洪，使溮河和淮河沿岸的三十万亩农田免去水灾；干旱季节又可放出六点五个秒公方的水灌溉农田。水库旁还要修建一座电厂，保证每年可供应九百零七万度电；发电尾水又可用以改善溮河下游航运，增加淮河干流的灌溉水量。修建南湾水库共分三个施工阶段，目前的重点工程是开挖坝基，开凿输水隧洞。
