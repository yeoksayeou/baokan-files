    War Merchant Dulles to Engage in Conspiracy in Europe and Asia
    Eisenhower headquarters announced on the 13th: The new U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and the new director of the "Mutual Security Agency," Stassen, will leave the United States at the end of January for a ten-day visit to Western Europe. According to Agence France-Presse's Washington dispatch quoting "well-informed sources," after inspecting the preparedness of Western Europe, Dulles will also visit Asian countries such as India and Pakistan this spring. His main purpose is to win over India and Pakistan to "help" in establishing an aggressive bloc "against communism" and to find ways to expand the existing U.S. military alliance in the Pacific.
    Undoubtedly, the people of Asia will treat the pig-nosed intruder from across the ocean with a heavy blow.

    战争贩子杜勒斯将赴欧亚地区进行阴谋活动
    艾森豪威尔总部十三日宣布：美国新国务卿杜勒斯和“共同安全署”新署长史塔生将于一月底离美赴西欧作十天的访问。据法新社华盛顿消息引“消息灵通人士”的话透露，杜勒斯在考察西欧备战情况以后，还将在今年春天访问印度、巴基斯坦等亚洲国家，其主要目的是拉拢印度和巴基斯坦在建立“反对共产主义”的侵略集团方面加以“帮助”，以及设法扩大美国在太平洋方面的现有军事联盟。
    无疑地，亚洲人民将以狠狠的打击对待闯进亚洲地区的大洋彼岸的猪鼻子。
