    Why Has the Changzhi Municipal People's Government Delayed Handling the Case of Kong Qingfeng Forcing a Shop Assistant to Death?
    Editor: The serious incident in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, where the illegal capitalist Kong Qingfeng forced shop assistant Han Guole to death after the "Five-Anti Campaign," was reported by the People's Daily on August 27th and September 1st of last year. The former report stated that the Changzhi Municipal People's Government had arrested the criminal Kong Qingfeng and decided to punish him severely according to the law. Five months have passed since this event, and no final action has been taken. The masses reflect: "According to the policy of 'leniency in the past, strictness in the future,' the criminal Kong should have been severely punished long ago, but why is it still being delayed?" The deceased's brother, Han Renle (also a shop assistant), said: "The illegal capitalist Kong Qingfeng forced my brother Han Guole to death, and I hate him to the extreme. Moreover, this is not just a matter of forcing my brother to death, but a matter of retaliation against our working class. I support the People's Government's arrest of the criminal Kong. However, I don't understand why it has been delayed for so long without any action being taken. Now, our whole family's thoughts are focused on the People's Government, hoping to redress the grievances of my deceased brother and punish the criminal Kong severely as soon as possible." The Changzhi Municipal People's Government's delay in handling such an important event is indeed unsatisfactory. I suggest that the higher-level People's Government promptly investigate and handle it.

### 长治市人民政府为何迟迟不处理孔庆丰逼死店员案

    长治市人民政府为何迟迟不处理孔庆丰逼死店员案
    编辑同志：山西省长治市违法资本家孔庆丰，在“五反”后逼死店员韩过乐的严重事件，曾经人民日报于去年八月二十七日和九月一日先后报道过。前报道中说，长治市人民政府已把孔犯庆丰逮捕，并决依法严办。这一事件到现在已经五个月了，一直还未见作最后处理。群众反映：“依据‘过去从宽，今后从严’的政策，对孔犯早应该严办了，但为什么还拖延不理呢？”死者的哥哥韩仁乐（也是店员）说：“违法资本家孔庆丰逼死我弟弟韩过乐，我痛恨到了极点。并且，这不只是逼死我弟弟一人的问题，而是向我们工人阶级报复的问题。人民政府逮捕了孔犯，我很拥护。但是，我不了解为什么拖了这样长的时间还不处理？现在，我们全家人的心思都集中在人民政府身上，希望为我死去的弟弟伸冤，赶快严办孔犯。”长治市人民政府这样拖延重要事件，的确不能令人满意。我建议上级人民政府迅速检查处理。    　曹华
