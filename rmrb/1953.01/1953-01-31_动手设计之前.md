    Before starting the design, it is essential to do a good job of design preparation. The quality and progress of the design will be directly affected by how well this work is carried out. This is a theorem that has been proven by many facts. However, for a considerable period in the past, due to our insufficient understanding of this issue, the design of some projects was repeatedly delayed or fraught with errors. In recent years, many facts in Anshan have told us that even for relatively simple designs such as building residences, sufficient preparation must be made, otherwise many errors will inevitably occur. For example, the residential construction project in Anshan in 1952 was revised as many as five times because the preparation work was not done well! As for the design of larger projects, that goes without saying. For example, in the design of a certain hot blast stove renovation project, the furnace wall condition was not thoroughly investigated before the design. After the design was completed, cracks were found in the furnace wall, so the design had to be delayed for another month. With the help of the Party and superiors, we corrected these shortcomings and errors in time and did not bring them into the construction; however, the experience and lessons it gave us are worth remembering forever.
    Based on the experience and lessons of Anshan in recent years, we believe that in order to do a good job of design work, after gathering relatively sufficient design forces -- of course, this is the most important and decisive part of doing a good job of design work -- the following four preparatory tasks should be done before starting the design:
    First, establish a basic construction plan as early as possible to create favorable conditions for starting the design as early as possible; never count the days backwards and squeeze the design time too short. Because we lack experience in large-scale construction and have insufficient understanding of the complexity of design work, we often do not calculate and determine the start and completion dates based on how long the design requires, how long the preparation requires... when determining the construction plan of a certain project, but instead, we work backward to first determine the construction and completion dates, and then leave the remaining time for preparation and design. The result of this reverse calculation often squeezes the design time too short, forcing the design work to be carried out in a rush. In this way, coupled with our weak design strength and lack of experience, it will inevitably cause many difficulties for the design work.
    So, how early should the basic construction plan be established, and what should be paid attention to in the formulation process? From the perspective of design work, the following four points must be noted when formulating the basic construction plan: (1) According to the current situation, if a system project like the No. 8 blast furnace is to be renovated, its specific construction plan should be determined at least eight months before construction, provided that a preliminary design is already available. Otherwise, the technical design will be difficult to complete on time. (2) If a project that takes a long time to build is to be built, it is best to make a specific, annual construction plan, provided that a preliminary design is already available. Never finish one section and then propose another section, because the engineering design of this year is often linked to the design of next year or the year after. Without this year's plan, and without next year's or the year after's plan, many major design problems often cannot be considered. Blind design will inevitably lead to confusion in the design process and irreparable economic losses. For example, according to this year's engineering requirements, 3 billion yuan will be used to build a processing plant, but next year it will be completely useless. This will result in a great waste. If next year's plan is known in advance, a more economical method can be adopted. (3) As far as the current situation is concerned, it is still difficult to completely avoid certain specific items being added, deleted, or changed in the basic construction plan, but the internal connections of the design of each project are very complex; the increase or decrease of many project items often affects the overall design. Therefore, when the planning department proposes to change project items, it must notify the design department as early as possible, and at the same time propose new measures after the change, so as not to increase the difficulty of the design department. (4) The design department should understand the design capabilities and how long it generally takes for what kind of design, so as to correctly arrange the entire plan, so as to avoid the phenomenon of counting the days backwards. According to our experience, if the above four points are achieved, the problems between planning and design can be largely solved.
    Second, in the case of an existing preliminary design, when starting the technical design, it is necessary to carefully study the specific plan of national capital construction, so as to formulate an accurate design plan. If there is no such plan, or the plan is not accurate, then the finished product of the design will inevitably have errors. Therefore, after the specific plan of the national design is determined, how to formulate an accurate design plan has become the most important design preparation work.
    It is not easy to compile this plan accurately, because it not only needs to stipulate the correct design procedure and arrange the design steps, but also needs to correctly determine how to specifically realize the various advanced technical standards that have been determined in the preliminary design. Anshan's experience proves that in order to compile this plan correctly, at least the following should be done: (1) Seriously and responsibly study the basic construction plan items proposed by the planning department. Because in the current situation, some plan items proposed by the planning department may have unreasonable phenomena in terms of economy and technology. For example, in Anshan's construction project plan in 1952, it unreasonably proposed that a certain factory should add a continuous heating furnace project, but this is actually not necessary. If the original plan is not studied, it is impossible to discover this unreasonable phenomenon. Of course, the planning department should try its best not to make mistakes, but therefore the design department should not study the plan, but adopt the method of taking it and using it, which is not right. In addition, another purpose of studying the plan is to further understand the plan, so as to lay the foundation for reflecting this plan in the design. (2) A responsibility system must be established when studying and compiling the plan. The method is: according to the number of plan items proposed by the planning department, take the project as a unit, determine an appropriate number of general design负责人 and professional design 负责人, and the general 负责人 organizes the professional 负责人 and other relevant designers to study each project plan and compile each project design plan. This will not only avoid the shortcomings of emptiness and untimelyness that occurred in the past when the design planning department compiled the plan alone, but also because the designers participated in the compilation of the design plan, it is easier to grasp the various principles stipulated in the plan in the design. (3) In the compilation of this plan, it is necessary to specifically study how to embody the various advanced standards stipulated in the preliminary design, and at the same time, according to the needs of construction, correctly stipulate the design order. Only in this way will the design work not make mistakes, and will not be out of touch with the needs of construction. (4) If the technical design is done abroad, of course we don't need to make a design plan, but in addition to clearly proposing the start and end dates of the design, the handover time, and the order of arrival, our design must also carefully consider the requirements of foreign designers for us, and formulate a plan to meet these requirements. For example, when do foreign designers require us to provide what information; according to their requirements, when do we submit what information, and so on. It should be particularly pointed out here that it is absolutely impossible to simply do things. If you do not consider things carefully in advance, it will not only add to the trouble of contact, but more importantly, it will inevitably affect the normal progress of foreign design, delay the completion date of the design, and even cause errors in foreign design.
    Third, after the design task book is approved, it is necessary to vigorously organize the investigation and surveying work of various original data.
    The relationship between original data and design is like the relationship between rice and food. Without rice, of course, food cannot be cooked. Therefore, after the design task book is compiled, vigorously organizing the investigation and surveying work of data has become an important key to the design preparation work. In the past, because we lacked sufficient understanding of this issue, the design work has suffered many difficulties, and even made some designs completely invalid. For example, in the design of a certain cooling tower renovation project, because the elevation of the original return water pipe was mistaken when collecting data, the entire design was invalidated.
    How can we do a good job of the original data? (1) To do a good job of the investigation and surveying of the original data, in addition to first formulating a unified and detailed investigation and surveying plan by the design department according to the needs of the design, so as to prevent confusion and omissions, it is also necessary to organize a special agency to bear this work, and should be equipped with sufficient technical personnel. If it is not necessary to establish a special institution because the project is not too large, it is also necessary to designate a special person to be responsible. Never let someone concurrently take on this important and complex work, or hand it over to someone who does not have this experience. (2) In addition to establishing a series of responsibility systems and review systems, it is also necessary to formulate work disciplines and regulations for collecting original data, and strictly prohibit bad phenomena such as hearsay and randomly quoting old drawings, so as to ensure the correctness of the original materials. Last spring, the thousands of drawings surveyed and mapped by the Anshan Capital Construction Design Office had an average of eight errors per sheet. The main reason was that there was no series of systems and disciplines such as responsibility systems, review systems, and work discipline regulations. Now that these work systems and disciplines have been established, this kind of phenomenon rarely occurs. (3) The main design person in charge must not only participate in the formulation of the plan for collecting original data, but also personally participate in the leadership of this work after the collection of original data begins. This approach has the following three benefits: First, it strengthens the leadership of this work; second, it becomes more familiar with the actual situation; and third, it creates better conditions for reviewing the correctness of the original data. (4) In the case of our insufficient technical strength today, it is very necessary to vigorously organize relevant agencies, factories, and mines to participate in the collection of original data. But when doing this, special attention must be paid to: 1. Explain the survey and surveying items, point out the methods, and set the completion date, so as not to have items but no methods, and have methods but not know when to complete them, so as to delay the design. 2. Special attention should be paid to strengthening the review of these original data. Because the comrades in these departments are not familiar with this work, they may make more mistakes than professional departments. If the review is not strengthened, these mistakes will inevitably slip through the net. 3. Provide more help to them.
    Fourth, collecting the technical data required for the design is an important item in the design preparation work.
    The rulers of the decadent and rotten old China did not even leave us many basic technical data; however, when carrying out larger designs, these data are indispensable. For example, China did not have a national product catalog in the past, so in design, we don't know what products can be used in China; nor do we know where to solve what technical problems. And this kind of product catalog cannot be compiled by our country for a while. Therefore, it is very necessary for each design department to collect these materials as early as possible according to its own needs. For example, in order to solve the problem of the material and waterproofing agent for the roof of a certain project in Anshan, it investigated the production technology capabilities of relevant factories in eight cities before finally solving the manufacturing problem of these materials.
    Of course, only domestic technical data cannot meet the needs of large-scale design, and foreign technical data, especially Soviet technical data, must be collected. Because their technical standards are the most advanced. In addition, we should also pay special attention to collecting various typical designs, so that they can be used at any time, and to lay the foundation for promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in using standard designs, so as to partially solve the current difficulty of our insufficient design strength. In order to make this work more organized, it is best to establish a technical library or technical archive room.
    Naturally, Anshan's experience in design preparation is still incomplete. But we believe that as long as we can do the above four points, it will make our design work take a step forward on the existing foundation.

    动手设计之前
    鞍山钢铁公司设计处处长　王金栋
    动手设计之前，必须做好设计的准备工作。这种工作进行得好坏，将直接影响设计的质量与进度。——这是已经为许多事实所证明了的一条定理。但在过去一个相当长的时期内，由于我们对这一问题没有足够的认识，致使某些工程的设计一再拖期，或错误百出。几年来，鞍山的许多事实告诉我们，那怕是像建筑住宅等比较简单的设计，亦必须进行充分的准备，否则亦必发生很多错误。比如，鞍山在一九五二年所建筑的住宅工程，因为准备工作作得不好，使设计修改了五次之多！至于较大工程的设计，当然更不必说了。比如某号热风炉改建工程的设计，因为在设计之前没有详细调查炉壁情况，及至设计完了之后，又发现炉壁有裂缝，以至设计不得不又拖了一月。这些缺点和错误，我们都在党和上级的帮助之下，及时改正了，没有把它带到施工中去；但是它所给予我们的经验和教训却是值得永远记取的。
    根据鞍山几年来的经验教训，我们认为，要把设计工作做好，在集结了比较充裕的设计力量之后，——当然，这是作好设计工作最重要的决定的一环——应在开始设计之前，做好下列四件准备工作：
    第一，及早订好基本建设计划，为及早动手设计创造有利条件；万万不可倒算时日，把设计时间挤得太短。由于我们对大规模的建设缺乏经验，对设计工作的复杂性认识不足，以至往往在确定某工程建设计划的时候，不是从设计需要多久，准备需要多久……来计算和确定动工与竣工日期，而是倒过来先确定施工与竣工日期，最后再把剩下的时间留给准备和设计。这种逆向推算的结果，往往把设计时间挤得太短，致使设计工作不得不被迫突击进行。这样，再加上我们的设计力量薄弱与经验不足，便必然给设计工作造成很多困难。
    那么，基本建设计划要订得多早、在制订中要注意些什么呢？从设计工作的角度看来，以下四点是在制订基本建设计划时必须注意的：（一）按照目前情况，如果要改修像八号高炉那样一个系统工程，在已有了初步设计的条件下，其具体的建设计划，最晚应在施工前八个月确定。否则，技术设计即难以按时完成。（二）如果修建一个需时较长的工程，在已有初步设计的情况下，最好能订出具体的、逐年的建设计划。千万不可干完一段，再提出一段。因为这一年的工程设计，往往和明年或后年的设计联系着。只有今年的计划，而无明年或后年的计划，设计上的许多重大问题往往无法考虑。若盲目设计，将必然招致设计程序上的混乱和经济上不可挽救的损失。譬如，根据今年工程要求，应用三十亿元建设一个加工厂，但明年它便完全没有用了。这样，就会形成很大浪费。如果预先知道明年的计划，便可以采用另外比较节省的办法。（三）就目前看来，基本建设计划之某些具体项目的增减变动，一时尚难完全避免，但每一工程项目设计的内部联系，又非常复杂；许多工程项目的增减，常常牵动设计的全局。因之在计划部门提出改变工程项目时，必须及早通知设计部门，并同时提出改变后的新措施，以免增加设计部门的困难。（四）设计部门应当了解设计能力与什么样的设计大体需时多少，从而正确的安排整个计划，以免产生倒算时日的现象。根据我们的经验来看，如果做到上述四点，计划与设计之间的问题，即可大体获得解决。
    第二，在已有初步设计的情况下，开始技术设计时，必须认真研究国家基本建设的具体计划，从而制订精确的设计计划。如果没有这种计划，或计划不精确，那么设计的成品便必然发生错误。因之在国家设计的具体计划确定之后，如何制订精确的设计计划，就成了最重要的设计准备工作了。
    要把这种计划编制得精确，不是一件容易事，因为它不仅要规定正确的设计程序，安排设计步骤，而且要正确地确定如何具体实现初步设计中早已确定了的各种先进的技术标准。鞍山的经验证明，要使这种计划编制得正确，起码应作到：（一）认真负责地研究计划部门提出的基本建设计划项目。因为在目前情况下，计划部门提出的某些计划项目中，很可能在经济上与技术上存在着不合理的现象。比如：鞍山一九五二年建设工程计划中，便不合理的提出了某厂要增建连续加热炉工程，而实际上这是不需要的。如果对原来计划不加研究，便不可能发现这种不合理现象。当然计划部门应当尽量不发生错误，但因此设计部门便不去研究计划，而采取拿来就用的办法，就不对了。此外，研究计划的另一目的是进一步了解计划，从而为在设计上体现这个计划打下基础。（二）在研究编制计划时，必须建立责任制。办法是：按照计划部门提出的计划项目的多少，以工程为单位，确定适当数量的设计总负责人及专业设计负责人，由总负责人组织各专业负责人和其他有关设计人员，研究各工程计划与编制各工程设计计划。这样，不但会避免过去单纯由设计计划部门编制计划时所产生的空洞和不及时等缺点，同时设计人员也因参加了设计计划的编制，在设计中更容易掌握计划中所规定的各种原则。（三）在编制这种计划中，必须对于如何体现初步设计中所规定的各项先进标准，加以具体研究，同时并根据施工需要，正确地规定设计次序。只有这样，设计工作才不会发生错误，才不会与施工需要脱节。（四）如果是国外做技术设计时，当然用不着我们做设计计划，但是我们的设计除了必须根据施工需要、明确提出设计的起止日期、交接时间、先后到达次序之外，还必须周密考虑国外设计者对我们的要求，制订出满足这些要求的计划。比如国外设计者要求我们在什么时候供给些什么资料；根据他们的要求，我们在什么时候提交什么资料等等。这里应当特别指出，万万不可简单从事，如果事先考虑不周，不仅会增添来往联络的麻烦，更重要的是必然影响国外设计的正常进行，迟延设计的完成日期，甚至造成国外设计的错误。
    第三，在设计任务书被批准之后，必须大力组织各种原始资料的调查、勘测工作。
    原始资料和设计的关系，就好像米与饭的关系，没有米当然煮不成饭。因此，在设计任务书编好之后，大力组织资料的调查与勘测工作，就成了设计准备工作的重要关键了。在过去一个时期中，因为我们在这个问题上缺乏足够的认识，因而曾使设计工作遭受过许多困难，甚至使某些设计全部作废。比如在某冷却塔改建工程的设计中，因为搜集资料时把原回水管的标高弄错了，致使整个设计全部作废。
    怎样才能作好原始资料呢？（一）要作好原始资料的调查勘测工作，除了首先由设计部门根据设计的需要，制订统一的详细的调查、勘测计划，从而防止混乱及遗漏外，还必须组织专门的机构负担这
    一工作，并应配备足够的技术人员。如果因为工程不太大，而无须成立专门机构时，也必须指定专人负责，千万不可把这一重大而复杂的工作随便让人兼任，或把它交给没有这种经验的人去作。（二）除了建立一系列的责任制及审查制度之外，还必须制订搜集原始资料的工作纪律及规程，严格禁止道听途说及随便引用旧图等不良现象，从而保证原始材料的正确性。去年春天，鞍山基本建设设计处所测绘的千余张图纸，平均每张存在八个错误，主要的原因便是没有建立责任制、审查制及工作纪律规程等一系列的制度、纪律。现在建立了这些工作制度与纪律，已经很少产生此种现象了。（三）各主要设计负责人员不仅必须参加制订搜集原始资料的计划，而且在搜集原始资料开始之后，必须亲自参加这一工作的领导。这种做法有以下三个好处：一、加强了对这一工作的领导；二、更加熟悉了实际情况；三、为审查原始资料的正确与否创造了更好的条件。（四）在我们今天技术力量十分不足的情况下，大力组织有关机关、厂、矿人员，参加原始资料的搜集工作是十分必要的。但在这样做时，必须特别注意：一、交清调查勘测项目，指出进行办法，定出完成日期。以免有了项目没办法，有了办法又不知何时完成，以致耽误设计。二、应特别加强对这些原始资料的审查工作。因为这些部门的同志不熟悉这一工作，可能比专业部门发生更多的错误。如果不加强审查，势必使这些错误漏网。三、多多对他们进行帮助。
    第四，搜集设计所需之技术资料是设计准备工作的重要项目。
    腐朽透顶的旧中国的统治者，连许多起码的技术资料都没有给我们留下；然而在进行较大的设计时，这些资料又是不可缺少的。比如中国在过去就没有全国的产品目录，这样，在设计时我们就不知在国内可以采用什么产品；也不知道什么地方可以解决什么技术问题。而这种产品目录目前我们国家又不可能一时编出。因此各设计部门，根据自己的需要，及早搜集这些材料是十分必需的。比如鞍山为了解决某工程房顶的材料和防水剂的问题，曾经调查了八个城市有关工厂的生产技术能力，才最后解决了这些材料的制造问题。
    当然，仅有国内的技术资料，仍不能满足大规模设计的需要，还必须搜集国外的技术资料，特别是苏联的技术资料。因为他们的技术标准是最先进的。除此之外，我们还应特别注意搜集各种典型设计，以便随时采用，和为推广苏联使用标准设计的先进经验打下基础，从而部分的解决目前我们设计力量不足的困难。为了使得这一工作进行得更有组织，最好能成立技术图书馆或技术档案室。
    自然，鞍山在设计准备工作方面的经验还是不完整的。但我们相信，只要能够做到上述四点，将会使我们的设计工作在现有基础上向前迈进一步。
