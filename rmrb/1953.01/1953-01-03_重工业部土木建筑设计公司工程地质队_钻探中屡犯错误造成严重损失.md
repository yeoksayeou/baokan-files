The Engineering Geology Team of the Civil Construction Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry (formerly under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government) has repeatedly made mistakes in surveying, causing serious losses.

Since the establishment of the Engineering Geology Team of the Design Company, drilling work has been very backward and chaotic. For example, in a 150-meter deep drilling project in a certain area, one borehole was drilled for more than a year from 1950 to 1952, with five reworkings, and twice the steel pipe was dropped into the hole. Finally, a malfunction occurred at a depth of 81 meters, so it was stopped halfway, costing 700 million yuan and delaying the task for more than a year without completion. Another example is the former team leader Zhao Wanfeng, who did not listen to the opinions of Soviet experts in drilling work and insisted on the old theories of the British and Americans, which caused great losses to the work.

In the past year, in order to cultivate the strength of the engineering geology team, the state has concentrated a large amount of manpower, invested tens of billions of funds, purchased a large number of new drilling tools, established a modern soil analysis laboratory, and armed this team with advanced Soviet engineering geological technical specifications, hoping that it can become the main force of engineering geology. However, the work of this team is still unsatisfactory, and the same mistakes are repeatedly made, causing many unnecessary losses. For example, the analysis of the allowable bearing capacity of the soil for the Angang dormitory project was initially said to be 25 tons per square meter, but after the wall was built, it was said to be only 18 tons, so the wall had to be thinned to reduce the load. Another example is the Northeast Electric Engineering Fourth Factory project, which underwent five drillings. The figure for the allowable bearing capacity of the soil was changed from 13 tons to 17 tons, and then to 15 tons, making the designers at a loss.

The reason why this team repeatedly makes mistakes in its work is mainly due to the lack of a high sense of responsibility for the national construction cause among the staff. The key to the failure to improve for a long time lies in the leadership. For example, in the engineering geological survey of the Songjiang Provincial Party School of the Communist Party of China, the comrade in charge of making conclusions picked up a piece of soil and said that the bearing capacity was 20 tons, and the design work was carried out according to this figure. However, after the soil analysis experimental results were obtained, it was found that the bearing capacity could only reach 15 tons, and the comrade who made the conclusion, in order to save face, actually altered the scientific analysis conclusion and still proposed it as 20 tons! When this mistake was found out, the foundation of the engineering building had already been completed and could not be salvaged. Despite the seriousness of the problem, the leaders of the design company have not paid due attention to it, have not taken active measures to improve the situation, have not taken effective steps to strengthen the leadership of technical personnel, and have not thoroughly checked and dealt with the mistakes that have been made. So far, no systematic summary has been made of the mistakes that have been made, so that the mistakes are repeated again and again.

### 重工业部土木建筑设计公司工程地质队  钻探中屡犯错误造成严重损失

    重工业部土木建筑设计公司工程地质队
    钻探中屡犯错误造成严重损失
    中央人民政府重工业部土木建筑设计公司工程地质队（前属东北人民政府工业部），勘测中屡犯错误，造成严重损失。
    设计公司工程地质队成立以来，钻探工作一直是十分落后而混乱的。如在某地一百五十公尺的深钻工作中，一个钻孔从一九五零年到一九五二年，钻了一年多之久，前后返工五次，并有两次将钢管掉在孔内，最后钻到八十一公尺深处又出故障，于是中途停止，损失七亿元，拖延一年多的时间始终未完成任务。又如前队长赵万丰，在钻探工作中不听苏联专家的意见，坚持英美一套的旧理论，使工作受了很大的损失。
    近一年来，国家为了培养工程地质队的力量，集中了大批人力，投入几百亿的资金，购买了大批新式钻探工具，建立了现代化的土壤分析实验室，并用苏联先进的工程地质技术规范来武装了这支队伍，希望它能成为工程地质的主力。但是，该队的工作仍然是不能令人满意的，一次再次地重犯同样的错误，造成许多不应有的损失。如对鞍钢宿舍工程土壤许可耐压力的分析，最初说是每平方公尺二十五吨，在墙砌起之后，又说只有十八吨，因而不得不把墙改薄以减轻荷重。又如东北电工四厂工程经过五次钻探，对土壤许可耐压力提出的数字由十三吨改为十七吨，随后又改为十五吨，使设计人员无所适从。
    该队所以在工作中屡犯错误，主要是工作人员缺乏对国家建设事业的高度责任感；而长久以来没有改进，关键则在于领导。如中共松江省委党校工程地质勘测中，该队负责做结论的同志随手拾起一块土来，捏了一捏，就说耐压力是二十吨，设计工作也就照着这个数字进行了。但土壤分析实验结果做出以后，发现耐压力只能达到十五吨，而这个做结论的同志为了顾全个人的脸面，竟涂改科学分析的结论，仍提为二十吨！当查出这项错误时，该工程建筑基础早已竣工，无法挽救了。问题尽管如此严重，而设计公司的领导人一直未予以应有的重视，没有用积极的办法改善这种情况，也没有采取有效步骤来加强对技术人员的领导，对已犯的错误更未彻底检查和处理，到目前为止也没有对已犯的错误进行有系统的总结，以致错误一犯再犯。
