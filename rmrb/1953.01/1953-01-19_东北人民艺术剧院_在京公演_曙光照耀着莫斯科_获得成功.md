The Northeast People's Art Theater's performance of the famous Soviet play "Dawn Over Moscow" in Beijing, as part of the capital's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, has been a great success. The performance began on November 26th of last year and ended on January 17th of this year, with nearly 60 shows and an audience of over 50,000. The communist morality of the Soviet people, and the close relationship between communist labor and the happy life of the people, as portrayed in the play, aroused great interest among the thousands of audiences in the capital. Many viewers believe that the play gave them a profound and vivid communist education, making them love life and work even more. They wrote letters and sent gifts to the drama workers of the Northeast People's Art Theater to express their gratitude for this excellent performance. One viewer wrote in a letter: "You have shown us the youth of communism and added luster to the capital's cultural activities." Many factory Party organization workers and trade union cadres saw a model for their work in Kulepin (the factory Party secretary in "Dawn Over Moscow"). A railway trade union cadre said in a letter: "In the past, I separated life from work and did not see the relationship between them. I didn't know that loving work also requires loving life. This play made me understand the relationship between work and life. I will enthusiastically embrace the new life and work and struggle for a better life for the people."

The capital's literary and art circles also attached great importance to this performance. The All-China Drama Workers Association, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration, and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers jointly held a forum to discuss the creation and performance of the play. Many literary and art workers also published articles in the newspapers praising the performance. Famous playwright Lao She said at the forum: This play is set in a factory, but it does not limit the play to the workshop and the director's office, but writes about the thoughts of people moving towards a communist society and their lives in various aspects, which is worth learning from. Playwright Cao Yu also said: After watching this play, I feel the importance of comprehensively and deeply understanding life even more.

Due to the success of the Northeast People's Art Theater's performance, drama work groups from East China, Central South, Northwest, Southwest, North China and other regions, as well as Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces, as well as literary and art groups from the military and trade unions in some regions of Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Harbin, sent people to Beijing to observe the performance and learn from the experience of this rehearsal. Currently, more than a dozen literary and art groups across the country are rehearsing and performing this play. The Literary and Art Troupe of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission and the North China People's Literary and Art Troupe have also rehearsed "Dawn Over Moscow" and are scheduled to perform in the capital around the Spring Festival.

    东北人民艺术剧院
    在京公演“曙光照耀着莫斯科”获得成功
    东北人民艺术剧院为参加首都“中苏友好月”活动来京公演苏联名剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”，获得了极大的成功。这一公演从去年十一月二十六日开始，到今年一月十七日结束，演出将近六十场，观众达五万多人。这个戏里所表现的苏联人民的共产主义道德，和共产主义劳动与人民幸福生活的密切关系，引起了首都千千万万观众很大的兴趣。很多观众都认为这个戏剧给了自己一次深刻而生动的共产主义教育，因此更热爱生活，深爱工作。他们纷纷给东北人民艺术剧院的戏剧工作者写信，送礼物，表示对这一卓越演出的感谢。一个观众在信中说：“你们使我们看到了共产主义的青春，也给首都的文艺活动增加了光彩。”很多工厂共产党组织的工作者和工会干部从库列聘（“曙光照耀着莫斯科”剧中的工厂党委书记）看到了自己工作的榜样。一个铁路工会干部在信中说：“我过去把生活和工作分开，看不出它们之间的关系。我不知道热爱工作也必须热爱生活。这个戏使我懂得了工作和生活的关系。我将热情投入新的生活的怀抱中，为人民更美好的生活而工作、而斗争。”
    首都的文艺界也非常重视这次演出。中华全国戏剧工作者协会、北京市人民政府文化事业管理处、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会曾联合举行座谈会讨论这个戏的创作和演出。许多文艺工作者也在报上发表文章，赞扬这次演出。名剧作家老舍在座谈会上说：这个戏以工厂为背景，但并没有把戏限制在车间和厂长室，而是写走向共产主义社会的人们的思想和他们各方面的生活，这是值得我们学习的。剧作家曹禺也说：看了这个戏，更感觉到全面而深入地了解生活的重要。
    因为东北人民艺术剧院的演出的成功，华东、中南、西北、西南、华北等区和湖北、湖南、山西、山东、四川、河北、浙江、安徽等省以及上海、天津、重庆、哈尔滨等市的戏剧工作团体，与一部分地区的军队和工会的文艺团体，都曾派人到北京来观摩这次公演，学习这次排演的经验。现在全国各地已经有十几个文艺团体正在排演和上演这个剧。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部文艺工作团和华北人民文艺工作团也分别排演了“曙光照耀着莫斯科”，并且都定于春节前后在首都公演。
