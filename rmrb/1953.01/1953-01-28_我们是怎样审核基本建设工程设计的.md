    How We Review Basic Construction Engineering Designs
    Gu Maozhang, Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, Central People's Government
    When creating preliminary designs, when deciding on design principles, and especially when entering the technical design phase, there are often numerous drawings, complex content, and a wide range of implications. To ensure "drawings leave the door without errors," a strict review system must be implemented.

    Strictly reviewing the engineering design of basic construction projects is one of the important methods to ensure design quality. However, this work is very arduous. Without a certain basis for review, it is often overwhelming to start the review work. Often, errors are still discovered after the review, and sometimes the drawings are returned from the site, and part of the design is reworked, causing a lot of loss of manpower, material resources, and time, and delaying the construction date.

    We have encountered many such problems in our past design work. During the quality inspection and summary last year, many errors were found in the designs of 1952. There were more than 50 cases of omissions alone. Most of them were caused by carelessness during the review.

    Later, we summarized the past experiences and lessons, and mobilized technical personnel to actively study and create, and explored some ways to strengthen the review work.

    One method is to formulate a review outline, according to the design sequence, to determine several principles and details in the preliminary design, technical design, and construction design. The design personnel then use this as a yardstick to conduct a review item by item. This method has played a great role in ensuring design quality. Before we had the review outline, the design was often done by one engineer and reviewed by the same engineer, wasting a lot of design power. When reviewing, design personnel with lower technical levels also felt difficult and did not know where to start. Taking the plumbing and heating group as an example, in the past, the team leader personally reviewed it. When reviewing the design of standard dormitories, it took half a month. Although many problems were found, the quality could not be guaranteed due to manpower constraints. Since the creation and application of the plumbing and heating review outline, not only can technicians take on this work, but also improve design efficiency and ensure design quality. For example, the plumbing and heating equipment in a factory design was 13,000 square meters. According to the past method, it would take at least half a month for three technicians to conduct the review. According to the plumbing and heating review outline, it only took one and a half days to complete, and the quality was guaranteed.

    Currently, we have formulated review outlines for architecture, structure, plumbing and heating, civil buildings, and electrical lighting design. During the review, we adopted the methods of first review, second review, and cross-review. Although these review outlines are not perfect enough and need to be supplemented and revised in the future, this review method is indeed a relatively suitable and good method to ensure design quality at present.

    The second method we use to strengthen the review work is joint review. When an engineering design enters the technical design or the construction design is completed, relevant design personnel and persons in charge of various types of work gather together to jointly review the drawings. Because an engineering design is divided into architecture, structure, plumbing and heating, electrical lighting, etc., each design may be correct when viewed in isolation, but when these drawings are put together, the phenomenon of disconnection is often found. The contradictions can be resolved by having the personnel responsible for each design concentrate on reviewing the drawings together. The procedure for conducting a joint review is: first, the original designer spreads out the drawings and explains the design intention one by one according to the design content, and then everyone expresses opinions, finds out problems, and puts forward suggestions for modification or supplementation. By using this method, we have timely discovered problems in the design and modified or supplemented them in time, ensuring the design quality.

    To do a good job in the joint review, our experience is that the following points should be noted: 1. Make full preparations before the joint review. The original designer or the person in charge of the work type must first collect review opinions before the meeting. In this way, problems can be raised and conclusions can be drawn at any time during the joint review, and time can be saved. 2. The personnel participating in the joint review must be personnel engaged in the design of the project and must have a certain amount of design experience, because only in this way can they put forward pertinent and practical opinions. 3. The person in charge of the original design must humbly accept everyone's opinions. If changes are made to the location, size, or replacement of equipment, it must be timely researched and jointly solved with various work types to obtain the correct solution. 4. The most important thing is that the participants in the joint review must provide opinions based on design principles and from the perspective of economic accounting, otherwise it is easy to be biased.

    我们是怎样审核基本建设工程设计的
    中央人民政府重工业部设计公司　顾懋璋
    当制作初步设计，要决定设计原则时，特别是进入技术设计时，往往图纸繁多，内容复杂，牵涉面很广。若要保证“图纸出门，不出差错”，就必须严格执行审核制度。
    严格审核基本建设的工程设计，是保证设计质量的重要方法之一。但是，这个工作是很艰巨的。在没有一定的审核依据的情况下，进行审核工作，往往会感到千头万绪，无从着手。常常审核完了，还发现错误，有时图纸被现场退回，部分设计重新返工，使人力、物力、时间蒙受不少损失，耽误了施工日期。
    我们在过去的设计工作中，曾遇到过不少这样的问题。去年进行质量检查总结时，在一九五二年的设计中，发现许多错误。单是漏写漏填的就有五十多件。其中大部分是审核时粗心大意造成的。
    以后，我们总结了以往的经验教训，并发动技术人员积极钻研创造，摸索出了一些加强审核工作的办法。
    一种是制订复核提纲，根据设计顺序，确定初步设计、技术设计、施工设计中的若干原则及枝节问题。设计人员即以此为准绳，逐条进行复核。这种方法在保证设计质量上起了很大作用。我们没有复核提纲前，往往是由这个工程师设计，同时又由这个工程师审核，浪费很大的设计力量。技术水平低一些的设计人员审核时，又感到困难，不知从何审起。以水暖组为例：过去他们是由组长亲自审核。在审核标准宿舍的设计时，花了半个月时间，虽然发现了不少问题，但因人力牵制，质量仍然不能保证。自从创造和应用了水暖复核提纲以后，不但技术员就能担当这一工作，同时，提高了设计效率，保证了设计质量。例如某厂设计中水暖设备有一万三千平方公尺，若按过去的办法，以三个技术人员进行审核，起码要半个月，根据水暖复核提纲来复核，只花一天半时间就完成了，而且保证了质量。
    目前我们已经制订出来的有建筑、结构、水暖、和民用建筑、电照设计的复核提纲。进行复核时，采用了一复、二复和交差复核的办法。虽然这些复核提纲还不够完善，还有待今后继续补充和修正，但是这一审核方式在目前确是一个比较合适的能够保证设计质量的好方法。
    我们加强审核工作的第二个方法是会审。当一个工程设计进入技术设计或施工设计完了时，由各工种有关设计人员和负责人聚集在一起，会审图纸。因为一个工程设计分建筑、结构、水暖、电照等多种，每种设计，孤立起来看，本身可能是正确的，但将这些图纸对在一起，往往就会发现互相脱节的现象。负责各项设计的人员将各种图纸集中在一起审核，这个矛盾就可解决。进行会审的程序是：首先由原设计人摊出图纸，根据设计内容，逐一讲解设计的意图，然后大家发表意见，找出问题，提出修改或补充的建议。我们运用这个方法，及时发现了设计中的问题，及时加以修改或补充，保证了设计质量。
    要做好会审工作，我们的体会，应该注意下面几点：一、会审前做好充分的准备工作。原设计人或工种负责人必须在开会前先搜集审核意见。这样，会审进行时，就能随时提出问题，得出结论，并且节省时间。二、参加会审的人员，必须是从事该工程设计的人员，并且要具有一定的设计经验，因为这样才能提得出中肯而又切合实际的意见。三、原设计负责人必须虚心接受大家的意见。如变更位置、尺寸，改换设备等，必须及时和各工种共同研究，求得正确的解决。四、最主要的是，参加会审人员必须根据设计原则，从经济核算观点出发来提供意见，否则容易发生偏向。
