Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 24th: The Central-South Construction Engineering Bureau has arranged all of this year's design tasks according to priorities within the first three quarters of the year. Based on the gradual increase in design capabilities, this year's design work will be carried out in progressively increasing amounts each quarter. The first quarter will complete slightly more than 22.2% of the total design tasks, the second quarter will complete slightly more than 33.3%, and the third quarter will complete slightly more than 44.4%. The fourth quarter will then concentrate on commencing next year's design work.

The Central-South Construction Engineering Bureau and the engineering bureaus of various provinces and cities currently have only over 500 design personnel, which is insufficient to complete the aforementioned design tasks. Therefore, the bureau has decided to add approximately 500 more design personnel in the first and second quarters of this year. In addition to first transferring a group of technically skilled personnel with design capabilities from the various construction departments within the system to strengthen the design departments, the main approach is to recruit a group of young students to participate in the work, learning while doing, to train a new batch of technical personnel in three to six months.

The Central-South Construction Engineering Bureau has been promoting standardized design. Currently, the main focus is on revising old drawings, starting with producing over thirty standard reference drawings for nine types of buildings, including single dormitories, offices, auditoriums, classrooms, and warehouses. In the future, efforts will be made to have the construction engineering bureaus of various provinces further produce a set of standard unit combination drawings for various types of houses, as well as designs for various standard design components. The work of revising old drawings will be completed before February 15th, and the work of producing standard unit combination drawings for various types of houses will be completed by the end of June. It is estimated that after this batch of standardized design drawings is produced, it can save approximately 10% to 20% of the design workload.

The Central-South Construction Engineering Bureau has conducted a general "scheduling" of the design work for the first quarter and has made proper allocations. Various units are forming specialized teams to engage in design work. At the same time, the bureau is placing a significant portion of its efforts on increasing design personnel in the first quarter. Whether they can complete this task is a crucial key to completing the annual tasks.

    中南建筑工程局分别缓急安排设计工作
    【新华社武汉二十四日电】中南建筑工程局已把今年全部设计任务按轻重缓急安排在今年的前三个季度内。根据设计力量逐步增长的情况，今年各季的设计工作将依次递增地进行，第一季度完成总设计任务的百分之二十二点二强，第二季度完成百分之三十三点三强，第三季度完成百分之四十四点四强。第四季度则集中力量着手进行明年的设计工作。
    中南建筑工程局及各省、市工程局现有设计人员仅五百多名，要完成上述设计任务，力量很不够。因此，该局决定在今年第一、二季度内再增加设计人员约五百名，除从本系统各施工部门有设计能力的技术人员中首先调集一批加强设计部门外，主要的办法是吸收一批青年学生参加工作，边学边做，以三个月到六个月的时间培养出一批新的技术人员。
    中南建筑工程局已在推行标准化设计。目前主要是翻改旧图，首先作出单人宿舍、办公室、大礼堂、教室、仓库等九种三十多幅标准参考图，以后争取各省建筑工程局进一步作出各类房屋标准单元组合图各一套，以及各种标准设计配件的设计等。翻改旧图的工作，将在二月十五日前完成，各种房屋标准单元组合图样工作将在六月底完成。估计这批标准化设计图作出后可以节省占工作总量百分之十到二十左右的设计力量。
    中南建筑工程局已把第一季度的设计工作，进行了总“排队”，分配停当。各单位正组成专责小组从事设计工作。同时该局正把很大一部分力量放在第一季增长设计力量工作上，他们这一任务能否完成，是完成全年任务的重要关键。
