    Publication and Distribution Organs Are Gradually Solving the Problem of Book Shortage in Ethnic Minority Areas

    People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: The "Readers' Letters Page" on December 18th of last year published letters from people in ethnic minority areas of Xinjiang and the Ikzhao League of Suiyuan, requesting publication and distribution organs to help solve the problem of book shortage. The situation reflected in these two letters and the opinions in the editor's note are correct.

    In the past, too few publications were published in ethnic minority languages, which is one of the problems that needs to be solved urgently in today's publishing work. According to incomplete statistics from our office: in 1951, a total of 176 types of books and textbooks were published in ethnic minority languages (Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Uyghur, etc.), totaling more than 2.22 million copies; in 1952, a total of 376 types of books, textbooks, picture albums, and pictures were published, totaling more than 4.39 million copies; a large increase is planned for 1953. In the past, our office paid attention to the publication of ethnic minority reading materials; but as the editor's note pointed out, due to subjective conditions, especially the limited translation and compilation forces, the number of books in ethnic minority languages cannot be increased a lot all at once. In order to strengthen the publication of ethnic minority reading materials in the future, the Nationalities Publishing House was established in Beijing on January 15th, responsible for translating and publishing books, pictorials in the languages of various ethnic minorities in China, and providing reading materials on ethnic policies and ethnic work for ethnic work cadres. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the distribution work in ethnic minority areas, so that appropriate and sound distribution networks have not been established in those places, and ethnic minority cadres have not been trained to undertake this work. In addition, the blindness in the distribution work in the past and the inconvenient transportation in many ethnic minority areas have also affected the minimum supply of books and periodicals in ethnic minority areas. However, since the second half of last year, Xinhua Bookstore has gradually strengthened its work in this area. For example, in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu and other places, mobile supply teams have been organized to go deep into ethnic minority residential areas with trade teams to supply books and periodicals; and it is planned to add more than 20 branches or outlets in ethnic minority areas in 1953 to gradually improve the supply of books and periodicals in these areas. We believe that the opinions in the editor's note are correct. In the future, we should further strengthen the education of distribution workers, promote the hard-working style of going deep into the masses, overcome the difficulties in the distribution work in ethnic minority areas, and meet the cultural needs of ethnic minority people.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    少数民族地区书籍缺乏问题出版发行机关正在逐步解决
    人民日报读者来信组：去年十二月十八日“读者来信专页”刊登了新疆和绥远伊克昭盟少数民族地区人民要求出版发行机关协助解决书籍缺乏问题的来信。这两封来信中反映的情况和编者按语中的意见都是正确的。
    过去用少数民族文字出版的读物的确太少，这是今天出版工作中急需解决的问题之一。据我署不完全的统计：一九五一年用少数民族文字（蒙、藏、哈、维吾尔文等）出版的图书课本共一百七十六种，计二百二十二万余册；一九五二年出版的图书、课本、画册、图片等共三百七十六种，计四百三十九万册；一九五三年计划大量增加。过去我署对少数民族读物的出版工作是注意的；但正像编者按语中指出的，因限于主观的条件，特别是限于编译力量，少数民族文字的书籍尚不能一下子增加得很多。为加强今后少数民族读物的出版工作，已于一月十五日在北京成立了民族出版社，负责翻译和出版国内各少数民族语文的图书、画刊及供给民族工作干部关于民族政策和民族工作方面的读物。对少数民族地区的发行工作，过去我们的确重视不够，以致在那些地方一直没有建立起适当的、健全的发行网和培养这方面的少数民族干部来担负这一项工作。而过去发行工作尚存在着盲目性及很多少数民族地区交通不便等原因，也使得少数民族地区最低限度的书刊供应受到影响。但自去年下半年来，新华书店对这方面的工作已逐步加强。如在新疆、青海、甘肃等地组织了流动供应组，随贸易小组深入少数民族居住区域供应书刊；并计划在一九五三年内在少数民族地区增设支店或门市部二十余处，以逐渐改善这些地区的书刊供应工作。我们认为编者按语中的意见是正确的，今后我们当更加强对发行工作者的教育，发扬深入群众的艰苦的工作作风，克服少数民族地区发行工作的困难，以满足少数民族人民的文化需要。  中央人民政府出版总署办公厅
