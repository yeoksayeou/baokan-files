    Proofs Should Not Be Issued Randomly
    Editor: I am a student at a military school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In our school, we have constantly received proof letters from some district and village (street) people's governments saying: "An emergency illness or death has occurred in the family of a certain student." Or simply: "So-and-so in the family of so-and-so student has passed away." They want the students to go home quickly. These letters, as proven by the facts, are often untrue. For example, after comrades Song Xiaowen, Peng Rongwen, and others returned to their homes thousands of miles away, they learned that their family members had not only not "passed away," but were not even sick. Not long ago, Tong Zhenqing successively received double-registered letters from his family bearing the official seal of the local street people's government saying: "His father (Tong Zhenqing) is very seriously ill and must return home immediately, otherwise it will be difficult to see him." After investigation, it was learned that his father was indeed ill, but not as serious as the original letter stated. This irresponsible phenomenon of randomly affixing official seals and issuing proof letters not only affects the work and study of revolutionary soldiers, but also undermines the prestige of the people's government. It is hoped that the people's governments of various districts and villages (streets) will pay attention to correcting this undesirable practice.

    不应该乱开证明信
    编辑同志：我是中国人民解放军某军事学校的学员。在我们学校里，曾经不断地接到某些区、村（街）人民政府的证明信说：“某某学员家中发生紧急病故。”或干脆说：“某某学员家中某某去世了。”他们要学员赶快回家。这些信，经事实证明，许多是不真实的。如宋效文、彭荣文等同志回到远离千里的家中后，知道家属不但没“去世”，而且连病也没有。不久以前，童震清连续接到他家中寄来的盖着当地街人民政府公章的双挂号信说：“他父亲（童震清）病势很严重，要即速回家，否则见面很难了。”经调查后，知道他父亲虽有病，但不像原信说的那么严重。这样不负责任地乱盖公章，乱开证明信的现象，不但影响了革命军人的工作和学习，而且破坏了人民政府的威信。希望各区、村（街）人民政府注意纠正这种不良作风。
