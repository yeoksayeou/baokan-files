The great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, who together account for one-third of the world's population, was further consolidated in 1952. The Soviet government's transfer, on the last day of 1952, of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the government of the People's Republic of China without compensation is a significant contribution to the development of the brotherly cooperation between the two peoples. In accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian of February 14, 1950, and the announcement of September 15, 1952, regarding the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway, the Government of the People's Republic of China received from the Soviet Government on December 31 all rights and all property belonging to the jointly managed Sino-Soviet Chinese Changchun Railway.

The property of the Chinese Changchun Railway, which the Soviet government transferred without compensation to the Government of the People's Republic of China in its entirety, includes: the main railway lines from Manchouli Station to Suifenhe Station and from Harbin to Dalian and Port Arthur, together with the land serving the railway, railway buildings and equipment, rolling stock – locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars, repair factories for internal combustion engine trains, locomotives and cars, power stations, telephone and telegraph offices, communication equipment and communication lines, auxiliary railway branch lines, official technical buildings and residential buildings, economic organizations, subsidiary enterprises and other enterprises and institutions, as well as property purchased, restored, and newly built during the period of Soviet-Chinese joint management.

The Soviet government's complete transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China vividly demonstrates the Soviet Union's extreme respect for the national independence, national rights, and interests of the Chinese people, and demonstrates the sublimity of the principles of Soviet foreign policy. This historically significant action is of great significance in strengthening the friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

The consolidated alliance and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples play a most important role in international life. This alliance and friendship is a powerful force for consolidating world peace.

Stalin wrote: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is the reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression, and a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and the world."

The alliance and friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples show the world a model of a completely new type of international relations that has emerged between countries of the socialist camp, a relationship based on complete and genuine equality, safeguarding the sovereignty and independence of all countries, mutual respect for national interests, close cooperation and mutual assistance, and joint efforts to strive for peace.

The great alliance of the Soviet and Chinese peoples consolidates the historical relations they established long ago. The Soviet people have deep friendship and respect for the Chinese people and for their heroic liberation war against feudal and imperialist oppression under the leadership of their long-tested leader Mao Zedong.

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly emphasized that the historical victory of the Soviet people greatly facilitated the liberation struggle of the Chinese people. Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese people's liberation movement was raised to a new and higher level. The victory of the Russian working people illuminated the path for the Chinese people to liberate themselves from imperialist and feudal landlord oppression. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the war against fascist Germany and imperialist Japan. The victory of this war greatly influenced the destiny of China. The Chinese people, taking advantage of the favorable international situation brought about by this victory, smashed the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group supported by American militarists under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, thus achieving a great victory in the struggle that had lasted for many years.

The Soviet people warmly welcomed the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China and establish diplomatic relations with it. The wishful thinking of the American ruling group to isolate this young republic internationally was thus thwarted.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950 opened a new era for consolidating the friendly relations between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. This treaty powerfully demonstrated the great Leninist-Stalinist principles of Soviet foreign policy and fully demonstrated the depth and strength of the fraternal friendship of the peoples of the two great countries.

The fundamental changes in the Far East brought about by the defeat of imperialist Japan, the defeat of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, which is friendly to the Soviet Union, have created new conditions that make it possible to resolve the issue of the Chinese Changchun Railway in a new way.

As everyone knows, this railway has been under the joint management of the Soviet Union and China until now. The Sino-Soviet Joint Commission for the Chinese Changchun Railway established for this purpose has been working on the principle of equality and mutual respect for sovereignty. The railway has achieved great economic success. The railway equipment damaged by Japanese militarists and Kuomintang elements has been rapidly restored and developed. According to Chinese newspapers, more than 1,000 Soviet experts have worked on the Chinese Changchun Railway in the past three years, and they have trained about 20,000 railway management personnel and technicians. The joint work of railway workers from the Soviet Union and China in an atmosphere of friendly cooperation is a major contribution to the further consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship based on the principles of equality and mutual assistance. The Chinese Changchun Railway has truly become a road of friendship between our two peoples.

Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Zhou Enlai, at the signing ceremony of the final protocol between the Soviet Union and China regarding the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China, expressed deep gratitude on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to the great Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin. He emphasized that the gratuitous transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China proves the Soviet government's boundless loyalty to the Sino-Soviet alliance. Zhou Enlai said: "This completely new type of fraternal cooperative relationship is undoubtedly a brilliant example unparalleled in the history of international diplomacy."

This unprecedented, new, and equal relationship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is in line with the principles of sincere cooperation established between countries of the democratic camp. This cooperation is based on mutual assistance and the sincere desire to promote the progress of the peoples of both countries.

Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, spoke about the great significance of this cooperation in a telegram to Comrade J.V. Stalin on February 11, 1952. He said: "We thank the Soviet government and people for the warm and generous assistance given to the Chinese government and people in the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its related agreements over the past two years. This assistance has greatly helped the recovery and development of the economy and the consolidation of the state in the new China."

Thanks to the friendship and support of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people have successfully implemented fundamental social and economic reforms in a very short period of time and have solved many major economic and political problems.

As the recent session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference pointed out, today's People's China has entered a period of large-scale, planned economic construction. The first five-year plan for building People's China will be implemented in 1953.

The Soviet people warmly welcome the news that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and their leader Mao Zedong, are confidently building a new life. They sincerely hope that the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union—a reliable guarantee of peace and security in the Far East and the world—will be further consolidated and developed.

    伟大人民的伟大友谊
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    在一九五二年，总共占全世界人口三分之一的苏联和中国两国人民的伟大友谊进一步巩固了。苏联政府已在一九五二年最后一天将中国长春铁路无偿地移交给中华人民共和国政府，这件事情对苏中两国人民兄弟般合作的发展，是一个重大的贡献。依照一九五○年二月十四日苏中两国关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定以及一九五二年九月十五日发表的关于移交中国长春铁路的公告，中华人民共和国政府在十二月三十一日从苏联政府手里接收了苏中共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该铁路的全部财产。
    苏联政府无偿地移交给中华人民共和国政府完全归其所有的中国长春铁路的财产中包括：从满洲里站到绥芬河站及从哈尔滨到大连及旅顺口的铁路基本干线连同服务于该路的土地，铁路建筑物与设备，车辆——机车、货车及客车车厢，内燃发动机列车、机车及车厢的修理工厂，发电站，电话所与电报所，通讯器材与通讯线路，铁路辅助支线，公务技术建筑物与居住建筑物，经济组织，附属企业及其他企业与机关，以及在苏中共管期间内购置、恢复和新建的财产。
    苏联政府将中国长春铁路完全移交给中华人民共和国政府这一行动，生动地证明了苏联对中国人民的民族独立、国家权利和利益极为尊重，证明了苏联外交政策原则的崇高性。这个具有历史意义的行动对于加强苏联和中华人民共和国的友谊是有巨大意义的。
    苏中两国人民的巩固的联盟和牢不可破的友谊在国际生活中起着最重要的作用。这种联盟和友谊是巩固全世界和平的强大力量。
    斯大林写道：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    苏中两国人民之间的联盟和友谊向世界显示了已在社会主义阵营国家间产生的一种全新的国际关系的范例，这种关系的基础是完全和真正的平等，维护各国的主权和独立，互相尊重国家利益，紧密的合作和互助以及为争取和平而共同努力。
    苏中两国人民的伟大联盟巩固了他们早就建立了的历史关系。苏联人民对中国人民、对他们在久经考验的领袖毛泽东的领导下进行的反对封建和反对帝国主义压迫的英雄的解放战争有着深厚的友情和尊敬。
    毛泽东同志一再着重指出，苏联人民的历史性的胜利大大地便利了中国人民的解放斗争。在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下，中国的人民解放运动提高到了一个新的、更高的水平。俄国劳动人民的胜利照亮了中国人民从帝国主义和封建地主压迫下解放出来的道路。在击败法西斯德国和帝国主义日本的战争中，苏联起了决定性的作用。这个战争的胜利大大地影响了中国的命运。中国人民利用这个胜利所引起的有利的国际局势，在光荣的共产党的领导下打垮了受美国军国主义者支持的蒋介石反动集团，从而使进行了许多年的斗争取得了伟大的胜利。
    苏联人民热烈欢呼中国人民革命的胜利。苏联是第一个承认中华人民共和国并与它建立外交关系的国家。美国统治集团企图使这个年青的共和国在国际上陷于孤立的如意算盘就这样被打乱了。
    一九五零年二月签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，为巩固苏中两国人民的友好关系开辟了一个新的纪元。这个条约特别有力地显示了苏联外交政策的伟大的列宁—斯大林的原则，充分表现了这两个伟大国家的人民的兄弟般的友谊的深度和力量。
    由于帝国主义日本的被击败、国民党反动政府的被打垮与对苏联友好的中华人民共和国的成立而在远东引起的根本变化已创造了新的条件，这种条件使得以新的方式解决中国长春铁路问题成为可能。
    大家知道，这条铁路至今是在苏中两国的共同管理之下。为这个目的而设立的中国长春铁路中苏联合委员会是根据平等与互相尊重主权的原则而进行工作的。这条铁路在经济方面取得了巨大的成就。被日本军国主义者和国民党分子所破坏的铁路设备迅速地恢复和发展了。据中国报纸指出，在过去三年中，在中国长春铁路上工作的有一千多名苏联专家，他们训练了约二万名铁路管理人员和技术人员。苏中两国的铁路工作人员在友好合作的气氛中共同完成的工作，对于以平等互助原则为基础的苏中友谊的进一步巩固是一个重大的贡献。中国长春铁路已真正成为我们两国人民之间的友谊的大道。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来同志在苏中关于苏联政府将中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府最后议定书的签署仪式上，代表毛泽东主席和中华人民共和国中央人民政府向伟大的苏联人民、苏联政府和斯大林同志表示深切的感谢。他强调指出，中国长春铁路无偿地移交给中华人民共和国政府证明了苏联政府对中苏友好同盟的无限忠诚。周恩来说：“这种完全新型的兄弟般的合作关系，毫无疑义地是国际外交史上无可比拟的光辉榜样。”
    苏联与中华人民共和国之间这种史无前例的、新的、平等的关系是符合民主阵营各国之间建立的真诚合作的原则的。这种合作的基础就是互相帮助和促进两国人民的进步的真诚愿望。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志在一九五二年二月十一日致约·维·斯大林同志的电报中谈到这种合作的伟大意义。他说：“我们感谢两年来苏联政府和人民依照中苏友好同盟互助条约及其有关各协定的精神，给予中国政府和人民热诚的、慷慨的援助，这些援助大大帮助了新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固。”
    由于苏联的友谊和支持，中国人民在很短的时期内就胜利地实行了根本的社会和经济改革，并解决了许多重大的经济和政治问题。
    正如最近中华人民共和国人民政治协商会议全国委员会会议指出的，今天的人民中国已进入一个大规模的、有计划的经济建设的时期。建设人民中国的第一个五年计划在一九五三年开始实施了。
    苏联人民热烈欢迎关于中国人民在中国共产党和他们的领袖毛泽东的领导下满怀信心地建设新生活的消息。他们热诚地希望中华人民共和国和苏联之间的伟大友谊——远东和全世界和平及安全的可靠保证——得到进一步的巩固和发展。
