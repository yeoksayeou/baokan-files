    Lenin on Opposing Bureaucracy
    Wang Ruoshui
    Bureaucracy has its social and historical roots. When analyzing the economic roots of bureaucracy in "On the Food Tax," Lenin pointed out: "The developed bourgeoisie needs a bureaucratic apparatus to oppose the revolutionary movement of workers (and partially peasants), first of all a military bureaucracy, and secondly a judicial bureaucracy, etc." Lenin inherited and developed Marx's revolutionary theory, and in "State and Revolution" and "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," he repeatedly emphasized the need to "destroy the bureaucratic-military state machine."
    Revolutionary democratic political organization is fundamentally opposed to bureaucracy. In "State and Revolution," Lenin said: "Bourgeois parliamentarism combines democracy (not for the people) with bureaucracy (anti-people), while proletarian democracy will immediately take measures to fundamentally eliminate bureaucracy, and can implement this method to the end, until bureaucracy is completely eliminated and democracy for the people is fully realized."
    The opportunist representative Kautsky believed that even under socialism, officials would still be necessary, and therefore bureaucracy would still exist. In "Report on the Party Program at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party," Lenin ridiculed Kautsky's attitude of "superstition" toward bureaucracy, and pointed out that Marxists had long found a way to eliminate bureaucrats: "Marx pointed out, based on the example of the Commune, that under socialism, public servants will no longer be 'bureaucrats,' will no longer be 'officials,' because in addition to implementing the election system, they also implement a system of dismissal at any time, and also implement reducing salaries to the level of the average worker's wage, and also replace parliamentary institutions with agencies that 'simultaneously perform legislative and administrative work.'" ("State and Revolution")
    The October Revolution shattered the old reactionary state machine, along with all its bureaucratic institutions. In March 1919, Lenin said: "In the struggle against bureaucracy, we have done something that no other country has done. That bureaucratic and bourgeois-oppressive apparatus, which remains such even in the most free bourgeois republic, has been uprooted by us."
    Thus, the political foundation of bureaucracy has been fundamentally eradicated. However, this is far from saying that bureaucracy has been completely eliminated. The remnants of bureaucratic poison still exist widely, and the remnants of this reactionary style are constantly reflected in the Party and Soviet organs. Under the new revolutionary regime, one of the sources of bureaucracy was the officials of the old reactionary government. This group of people entered the Soviet power organs and still retained the old style. Lenin spoke of them in the same report mentioned above:
    "We have driven out these old bureaucrats, exposed them, and then started assigning them to new positions. The bureaucrats of the Tsarist era gradually turned to the Soviet organs, practiced bureaucracy, disguised themselves as communists, and tried to obtain membership cards of the Russian Communist Party in order to gain promotion. So just after driving them out the door, they crawled in through the window! This is mainly due to the lack of talent in cultural work. These bureaucrats could have been dispersed, but they could not be transformed all at once."
    In the article "Better Fewer, But Better," Lenin said when discussing the issue of improving state organs: "Incidentally, we have bureaucrats not only in the Soviet organs, but also in the Party organs." Of course, these bureaucrats are not entirely old officials from the reactionary regime, but also some original revolutionary workers. As early as before the October Revolution, Lenin pointed out in "State and Revolution" that cadres within proletarian organizations may also be influenced by the capitalist environment and become infected with bureaucracy:
    "Under capitalism, democracy is curtailed, suppressed, and mutilated by the entire environment of wage slavery and mass poverty and misery. Therefore, and only therefore, the staff in our political and trade union organizations are corrupted by the capitalist environment (or, to put it more correctly, there is a tendency to be corrupted), and show a tendency to become bureaucrats, that is, to become privileged people who are divorced from the masses and ride on top of the masses. This is the essence of bureaucracy, and until the capitalists have been expropriated, until the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, even proletarian public servants will inevitably be quite 'bureaucratized'."
    People's consciousness changes often lag behind objective existence. Therefore, even after the bourgeoisie is eliminated and the economic roots of bureaucracy are eradicated, the bureaucratic style inevitably continues to exist for a long period of time. And the reason why bureaucracy has become a long-term problem is also because it is often related to scattered and conservative small production.
    In "On the Food Tax," Lenin pointed out that the economic roots of bureaucracy mainly have two aspects. In addition to the one mentioned above, Lenin said: "Our bureaucracy has another economic root: the scattered state of small producers, their poverty, ignorance, poor transportation, illiteracy, the lack of circulation between agriculture and industry, and the lack of connection and assistance between the two." Therefore, here, Lenin called bureaucracy "the superstructure of the small producer's disorganization and demoralization."
    At the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, Lenin said: "We must understand that the struggle against bureaucracy is an absolutely necessary struggle, which is as complex as the task of fighting against petty-bourgeois spontaneity. In our state organs, bureaucracy has become such a scabies that it must be mentioned in our Party program, because it is related to this petty-bourgeois spontaneity and its disorganization."
    This kind of bureaucracy based on small production is mainly manifested in following old ways, being unconcerned, not being eager to learn, not studying business, perfunctorily doing things, being lax and disorganized, and being blindly subjective.
    Lenin deeply hated these bureaucratic phenomena and advocated resolutely eradicating them. In "On the Food Tax," Lenin said: "Our central organs, in these three and a half years, have already acquired certain harmful habits of following old ways... Among us, all those who must remain working in the central organs, even within a fairly narrow and directly achievable scope, must continue to carry out this work of improving the organs, cleaning up the bureaucracy within them." In the article "On Cleansing the Party," he also said: "Those who deceive, bureaucrats, dishonest elements, wavering communists, and those who have changed their 'facades' but are still Mensheviks in their hearts should be purged from the Party."
    Bureaucracy can be manifested as working hard all day but accomplishing nothing. In the "Political Report of the Central Committee at the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party," Lenin described a "very typical phenomenon." The Moscow Consumer Cooperative accused the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade of bureaucracy. The matter happened with canned goods. There was no food in Moscow. The Consumer Cooperative needed to buy canned goods. The ship carrying the canned goods was docked in Libava. But the comrades in Moscow were crying: "We can't buy canned goods." In order to buy some canned goods, there were two investigations, and even the problem was moved to the Central Political Bureau. No one knew how to do this, and no one could take responsibility. "No thinking, no preparation, just rushing around, several committees, making everyone tired, exhausted, and sick," but the canned goods still did not arrive. Only when two members of the Political Bureau personally intervened did things progress. Lenin said that such things would be done by any clerk trained in a large capitalist enterprise, but 99% of responsible communists would not be able to do it. Why is this? Not because they are not loyal, not because there is no money, and not because there is no political power, but simply because of "a lack of cultural talent—they cannot accurately handle business." Lenin criticized them for "not being willing to understand that they do not have this skill and should start learning from scratch."
    Bureaucracy is inseparable from arrogance and a pompous attitude. Lenin said: "This quality, which the French call Pruderie, and we call ridiculous affectation or ridiculous arrogance, will completely contribute to the bureaucrats in our Soviet or Party organs." ("Better Fewer, But Better") Lenin once regarded "communist conceit," "illiteracy," and "corruption" as the three main enemies. A communist with conceit is a person who fantasizes about "solving all his tasks by issuing communist orders." ("The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department")
    Lenin believed that expanding democracy, expanding contact with the people, carrying out supervision from the bottom up, and extensively absorbing the masses to participate in management are the fundamental means to eliminate bureaucracy. In 1918, he said: "The firm connection between the Soviets and the 'people,' that is, with the exploited laborers, and the flexible and elastic connection, is enough to prevent the phenomenon of bureaucracy from deteriorating the Soviet organization... Now, the more firmly we advocate a ruthless and tough regime, the more firmly we advocate personal dictatorship in a certain work process and in a certain purely executive function, the more varied forms and methods of supervision from below we should have, in order to prevent any possibility of deteriorating the Soviet regime, in order to tirelessly eradicate the weeds of bureaucracy." ("The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime") He also said: "Only when all residents participate in management can the struggle against bureaucracy be carried out thoroughly and bureaucracy can be completely defeated." ("Report on the Party Program at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party") Under Lenin's suggestion, the program of the Russian Communist Party also stipulated: "The participation of trade unions in economic management and the absorption of the broad masses to participate is also the main weapon in the struggle against bureaucracy in the economic organs of the Soviet regime, and provides the possibility of implementing genuine people's supervision over production results."
    In order to fully absorb workers and the people to participate in management and supervise the government, popularizing education and improving culture are very important. Lenin pointed out: "Even in the best bourgeois republic, no matter how developed democracy is there, there are countless legal obstacles that prevent the working masses from participating in management. We have completely eliminated these obstacles, but we have not yet reached the point where the working masses can participate in management—because in addition to the law, there is also the level of culture, and you cannot make it subject to any law. This low level of culture has made the Soviets, although in principle they are organs that are managed by the working masses, in practice they are managed by the advanced class of the proletariat for the working masses, but not by the working masses themselves. The task before us here can only be solved by long-term educational work... The bureaucrats have been defeated. The exploiters have been eradicated. But the level of culture has not yet been raised, so the bureaucrats have occupied their old positions again. To push them out, we can only organize the proletariat and the peasants on a larger scale than ever before, and at the same time truly implement various methods to attract workers to participate in management." ("Report on the Party Program at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party")
    In October 1921, at the Second All-Russian Congress of the Political Education Department, Lenin reiterated this point: "The Soviet laws are very good, because these laws give everyone the opportunity to oppose bureaucracy and procrastination; no capitalist country has given workers and peasants this opportunity. But who has used this opportunity? Almost no one! Not only the peasants, but also a very large percentage of communists, will not use Soviet laws to oppose bureaucratic habits and bureaucracy, or to oppose corruption, which is a real Russian phenomenon. What hinders the struggle against this phenomenon? Is it our law? Is it our propaganda? On the contrary! Enough laws have been written! Why is there no success in this struggle? Because this struggle cannot be carried out only by propaganda. It can only be accomplished when the people themselves help in this struggle." ("The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department")
    China's current situation is similar to that of the Soviet Union shortly after the October Revolution in many respects. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was overthrown only three years ago, and a large number of old officials from the Kuomintang era continued to work in the people's government organs. Many of them have undergone ideological transformation, but many still maintain the old bureaucratic style. Moreover, China is a country where small production accounts for a very large percentage. Although there has been great improvement in the past three years, cultural backwardness is still a common phenomenon, and democratic life still needs to be further developed. The reactionary style of the Kuomintang reactionary ruling class towards the people, that is, the anti-people style, still has many remnants in our people's power organs and is reflected everywhere. This is even more clearly the social root cause of many of our bureaucratic phenomena today, which must be eradicated. On the occasion of commemorating the 29th anniversary of Lenin's death, carefully understanding these instructions of Lenin will undoubtedly be of great significance to our struggle against bureaucracy.

    列宁论反对官僚主义
    王若水
    官僚主义有它的社会历史根源。列宁在“论粮食税”中分析官僚主义的经济根源时，曾指出：“已臻发展的资产阶级，正为了反对工人（局部地反对农民）的革命运动，需要官僚机关，首先是军事的，其次是法庭等等的官僚机关。”列宁继承和发挥了马克思的革命学说，在“国家与革命”“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”中，曾再三强调了“毁坏官僚军事国家机器”的必要。
    革命民主的政治组织是和官僚制度根本对立的。列宁在“国家与革命”中说：“资产阶级国会制是把民主制（不是供人民享用的）与官僚制（反人民的）联成一气，而无产阶级的民主制则会立即采取办法来根本铲除官僚制，且能够把这种办法实行到底，一直到把官僚制完全消灭，把供人民享用的民主完全实现为止。”
    机会主义的代表考茨基认为即使在社会主义下，官吏还是非有不可的，因而官僚制也将仍然存在。列宁在“俄国共产党第八次代表大会上关于党纲的报告”中讥诮了考茨基的这种“迷信”官僚主义的态度，并且指出，马克思主义者老早已找到了消灭官僚的办法：“马克思正是按公社的实例而指明在社会主义之下，公务人员将不复是‘官僚’，将不复是‘官吏’，其所以如此，是因为除实行选举制以外，还实行随时撤换制，并且还实行使薪俸减到工人平均工资的水准，并且还以‘同时兼任立法和行政的工作的’机关去代替国会机关。”（“国家与革命”）
    十月革命粉碎了旧的反动的国家机器，连带着它的一切官僚机构。列宁在一九一九年三月说：“我们在反官僚主义的斗争中，作到了任何一个国家都没有作到的事情。那种彻头彻尾都是官僚主义的和带资产阶级压迫性的机关，甚至在最自由的资产阶级共和国中都仍旧是这种性质的机关，已经被我们连根带蒂铲除了。”
    这样，官僚主义的政治基础，已经根本铲除掉了。然而，这还远不是说，官僚主义已经完全消灭。官僚主义的遗毒还普遍存在着，这种反动作风的残余还不断反映到党和苏维埃机关里来。在新的革命政权下，官僚主义的来源之一是旧的反动政府的官吏，这一批人进入了苏维埃政权机关，依然保留旧的一套作风。列宁在上述同一个报告中谈到他们的时候说：
    “我们已经把这种旧官僚主义分子赶走掉，检举过，然后又开始委派他们担任新的职务。沙皇时代的官僚渐渐转入苏维埃机关，实行官僚主义，装扮为共产主义者，并且为了钻营升迁起见，设法取得俄国共产党的党证。所以刚刚把他们赶出大门之后，他们又从窗户里钻进来了！这里主要是由于文化工作人材不够。这些官僚本来可以驱散，但是决不能一下子把他们改造过来。”
    列宁在“宁肯少些，但要好些”的文章中谈到改善国家机关的问题时又说：“附带说说，我们这里，不仅在苏维埃机关内，而且在党的机关内也有官僚分子。”当然，这些官僚分子不完全是反动政权时代的旧官吏，而也有些原来的革命工作人员。早在十月革命前，列宁在“国家与革命”中就指出无产阶级组织内的干部也可能受资本主义环境的影响，而沾染上官僚主义：
    “在资本主义下，民主制是被雇佣奴隶制和群众贫乏困苦的全部环境所缩小，压抑和割削得残缺不全。因此，而且仅仅因此，在我们的政治组织和工会组织内的职员就被资本主义环境所腐化（或者说得更正确些，有一种被腐化的趋势），以及表现出变为官僚的趋势，就是说变为脱离群众而驾于群众之上的特权者的趋势。这就是官僚主义的实质所在，而当资本家没有被剥夺以前，当资产阶级没有被推翻以前，甚至无产阶级公务人员都不免会相当‘官僚化’的。”
    人们的意识的变化往往是落后于客观存在的。因此，即使在消灭了资产阶级，铲除了官僚主义的这种经济根源以后，官僚主义作风仍不免在很长的时期内继续存在。而官僚主义之所以成为一个长期的问题，还因为它往往是和分散保守的小生产相联系着的原故。
    列宁在“论粮食税”中，指出了官僚主义的经济根源主要有两方面，除了上举的一个方面外，列宁说：“我国的官僚主义具有另一种经济根源：小生产者的零散状态，他们的贫困，不开化，交通闭塞，文盲现象，农业与工业间缺乏周转，两者间缺乏联系和协助作用。”所以在这里，列宁把官僚主义叫做“小生产者之散漫与萎靡状态的上层建筑物”。
    在俄共第十次代表大会上，列宁又说： “我们必须明白，同官僚主义作斗争乃是一种绝对必要的斗争，这与同小资产阶级自发性作斗争的任务，是同样复杂的。在我们的国家机构当中，官僚主义已成为这样一种癣疥，以致于在我们的党纲中也要讲到它，这是因为它是同这种小资产阶级的自发性及其散漫性相联系着的。”
    这种基于小生产的官僚主义主要表现为因循守旧，无所用心，不虚心学习，不钻研业务，敷敷衍衍，松懈散漫，盲目主观等。
    对于这些官僚主义现象，列宁深恶痛绝地主张加以坚决的铲除。在“论粮食税”中，列宁说：“我们的中央机关在这三年半来，居然已经拥有某些有害的因循惯习……我们中间，凡属必须留在中央机关工作的人，即令是在相当狭小和直接能做到的范围内，也得继续进行这改善机关的工作，清洗其中的官僚主义。”在“论清党”一文中他又说：“应该把欺骗分子，官僚化分子，不诚实的分子，不坚定的共产党员，以及虽然改装过‘门面’，但内心里还照旧是孟什维克的那些人，从党内清洗出去。”
    官僚主义可以表现为辛苦终日，而一事无成。列宁在“俄国共产党第十一次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告”中曾叙述一件“极标本式的现象”。莫斯科消费合作社曾控告对外贸易人民委员部的官僚主义。事情发生在罐头上面。莫斯科没有粮食。消费合作社需要买罐头。装罐头的轮船就停在利巴瓦。但莫斯科的同志在号泣：“我们买不到罐头。”为了买点罐头，经过了两次调查，甚至把问题搬到了中央政治局。大家都不会做这件事，大家都负不了责。“没有任何思考，毫无准备，徒事奔忙，好几个委员会，弄得大家都疲倦了、困惫了、病倒了”而罐头还是没有到手，只当两个政治局委员亲自出来过问时，事情才有进展。列宁说，这样的事，任何一个经过资本主义大企业训练的店员都会做的，而百分之九十九的负责共产党员却不会做。这是因为什么呢？不是由于他们不忠实，也不是由于没有钱，更不是由于没有政治权力，而只是由于“缺乏文化才干，——他们不能精确地来处理业务。”列宁批评他们“不愿意了解到，自己没有这种技巧，应该从头开始学习”。
    官僚主义和倨傲、摆架子的态度是分不开的。列宁说：“这种品质，法国人叫它是Pruderie，我们称之为可笑的装模作样或可笑的自尊自傲，这种品质会完全助长我国苏维埃机关或党机关内的官僚分子。”（“宁肯少些，但要好些”）列宁曾把“共产主义的自高自大”“文盲”“贪污”作为三个主要的敌人。共产主义的自高自大者是这样一种人，他幻想“用颁布共产主义命令的方法解决他一切的任务”。（“新经济政策与政治教育部的任务”）
    列宁认为，扩大民主，扩大与人民群众的联系，开展自下而上的监督，广泛地吸收群众参加管理工作，是肃清官僚主义的根本手段。他在一九一八年说：“苏维埃与‘人民’，即是与被剥削劳动者之间有巩固的联系，有着灵活的和伸缩自如的联系，这就足以防止官僚主义恶化苏维埃组织的现象。……现在，我们愈坚决主张无情强硬的政权，愈坚决主张在某种工作过程中，在某种纯粹执行的职能方面实行个人独裁制，则我们便应该有愈加纷繁的自下的监督形式和方法，以便杜绝恶化苏维埃政权的任何可能性，以便再三不倦地铲除官僚主义的莠草。”
    （“苏维埃政权的当前任务”）又说：“只有当全体居民都参加管理工作时，才能彻底进行反官僚主义的斗争，才能完全战胜官僚主义。”（“在俄国共产党第八次代表大会上关于党纲的报告”）在列宁的提示下，俄共党纲并规定：“职工会参与经济管理并吸收广大群众参加，这又是与苏维埃政权经济机关中官僚主义作斗争的主要武器，并提供出对生产结果实行真正的人民监督的可能性。”
    为了要做到充分吸收工人和人民群众参加管理工作，监督政府，普及教育，提高文化是有很重要的作用的。列宁指出：“那怕在最好的资产阶级共和国内，尽管那里民主制如何发展，还是有无数法律上的障碍，阻碍着劳动群众去参加管理工作。我们已经彻底扫除了这些障碍，可是我们至今还没有达到使劳动群众能够参加管理工作的地步，——因为除了法律之外，还有文化水准，而这你是不能使之服从任何法律的。这种低度的文化水准遂使苏维埃虽然在纲领上是经过劳动群众来实行管理的机关，而在实际上，却是经过无产阶级先进阶层来为劳动群众而实行管理的机关，但不是经过劳动群众本身来从事管理。这里摆在我们面前的任务，只有用长期教育工作才能解决。……官僚已被打败了。剥削者已被铲除了。但是文化水准还没有提高，所以官僚们又占据了旧有的位置。要把他们排挤出去，只有把无产阶级和农民比迄今以前更大规模地组织起来，同时真正实行吸引工人来参加管理的种种办法才能作到。”（“在俄国共产党第八次代表大会上关于党纲的报告”）
    一九二一年十月列宁在政治教育部第二次全俄代表大会上，又重复强调了这一点：“苏维埃的法律是很好的，因为这些法律给予每一个人以反对官僚主义及拖延习气的机会；在任何资本主义国家里面，都没有给予工人和农民以这种机会。然而有什么人利用了这种机会呢？差不多没有一个人！不仅是农民，就是极大百分比的共产党员，也不会利用苏维埃的法律去反对官僚习气与官僚主义，或反对像贪污这种真正的俄罗斯的现象。什么东西妨碍了反对这种现象的斗争呢？是我们的法律吗？是我们的宣传吗？恰恰相反！写了足够的法律！为什么在这种斗争中没有成绩呢？因为这种斗争不能够仅仅由宣传来进行。只有人民大众自己帮助这种斗争的时候，才能够完成它的。”（“新经济政策与政治教育部的任务”）
    中国的现时情况，在很多地方是与十月革命后不久的苏联类似的。国民党的反动统治被推翻只不过三年多，国民党时代的旧官吏也有很大一批继续留在人民政府机关内工作，他们很多经过了思想改造，但也有不少仍然保持了旧日的官僚作风，而中国又是一个小生产占极大百分比的国家，虽然三年来已有很大改进，但文化落后仍是普遍现象，民主生活也还待进一步发扬。国民党反动统治阶级对待人民的反动作风，即反人民的作风，在我们人民政权机关中还有许多残余，并且到处反映出来。这更显然是我们今天的许多官僚主义现象发生的社会根源，必须加以铲除。在纪念列宁逝世二十九周年的今天，仔细体会列宁这些指示，对我们反对官僚主义的斗争，无疑是会有极大意义的。
