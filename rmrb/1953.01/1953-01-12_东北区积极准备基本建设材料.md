Xinhua News Agency Report:

The basic construction units in the Northeast region are actively preparing materials. Currently, the reserves of key materials needed for the large-scale construction commencement in the region are basically ready. For example, the red brick reserve has exceeded the original plan by 60%; the reserves of cement, wood, and rebar have reached 30% to 50% of the total annual demand for this year. These materials will be transported to the construction sites in batches before construction begins.

The basic construction departments have started material preparation since October 1952, and have signed supply and transportation contracts with supply and transportation departments respectively. Many units have now begun transportation. In Liaoxi Province, for all projects with preliminary designs completed and construction sites determined, the amount of materials used has been calculated and material allocation maps have been made, and materials are being vigorously transported to the construction sites. Most of the basic construction units in Harbin have also started transportation according to the order of materials allocated by the state. In order to solve the problem of insufficient urban transportation capacity, the Harbin Municipal People's Government has specifically established a transportation team, organizing automobiles, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts throughout the city to carry out transportation during the winter slack season. The Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has basically completed the procurement of major materials from Northeast China, within China, or from abroad, and is now actively organizing transportation forces to prepare for the timely delivery of materials to various construction sites.

The factories, mines, and companies that supply basic construction materials have also made full preparations to ensure that basic construction starts on schedule this year. For example, the cement plants under the Northeast Architectural Industry Administration prepared the cement needed for the start of construction this year in the fourth quarter of 1952, and five cement plants are adding equipment to expand production. Factories and mines in various places are using the winter slack time to organize farmers to carry out sideline production of sand hauling and stone breaking to store sand and stone. A certain area in Liaoxi Province has stored 200,000 cubic meters of sand. A certain local state-owned sand and soil mining company has stored more than 100,000 cubic meters of crushed stone and 600,000 cubic meters of sand. In terms of small hardware and plumbing equipment, the Northeast Region Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company has prepared all the raw materials according to the needs of the entire region, and has coordinated with the economic planning commissions, industry and commerce bureaus, and industry and commerce federations of various provinces and cities to organize state-owned, local state-owned, and private small hardware and plumbing equipment factories with processing and ordering capabilities to process and order according to unified new specifications. Shenyang City has mobilized more than 660 private small hardware and plumbing equipment factories to specialize in processing small hardware and plumbing equipment for basic construction.

[Additional Report] The Shenyang Transportation Company has organized more than 10,000 rubber-wheeled horse-drawn carts and trucks to participate in winter material transportation work to support the city's basic construction units. This strong transportation force completed the monthly material transportation tasks of 56 basic construction units in December last year alone.

In order to encourage various basic construction units to submit transportation plans as early as possible, the Shenyang Transportation Company has stipulated preferential measures for winter material transportation. At present, 104 basic construction units have signed transportation contracts with the company. In order to ensure the completion of the transportation tasks of major projects first, the company changed the past practice of accepting goods and allocating vehicles by its subordinate offices, starting in December last year, to centralized management and unified allocation by the company's business section. In this way, the utilization rate of vehicles has been greatly improved, and the serious phenomenon of vehicles returning empty, which was caused by decentralized allocation of vehicles in the past, has been changed.

    东北区积极准备基本建设材料
    【新华社讯】东北各基本建设单位正积极进行材料准备工作。目前全区在大规模施工开始时所需的主要材料已基本上准备就绪。如红砖储备量已超过原计划的百分之六十；水泥、木材、钢筋的储备量已达到今年全年需要量的百分之三十到五十。这些材料将在施工前陆续运到现场。
    各基本建设施工部门从一九五二年十月份起就开始了材料的准备工作，分别和供应、运输等部门签订了供应和运输合同。现在不少单位已开始运输。辽西省凡是做出初步设计、建筑地点已确定的工程，都已计算好材料使用量和作出材料配置图，开始大力往工地运料。哈尔滨市大部分基本建设单位也已根据国家调拨材料的顺序开始运输。哈尔滨市人民政府为了解决城市运输力不足的困难，专门成立了运输小组，组织全市汽车、马车和手推车，利用冬闲期间进行运输。鞍山钢铁公司基本建设材料处向东北、关内或国外采购的主要材料，已基本上采购齐全，现在也正积极组织运输力量，准备把材料按期运送到各工地。
    各供应基本建设材料的厂矿、公司，为了保证今年各地基本建设如期开工，也都做了充分准备。如东北建筑工业管理局所属各水泥厂，在一九五二年第四季度的生产中就准备好了今年开工时所需的水泥，并有五个水泥厂正添置设备，扩大生产。各地厂矿都利用冬闲时间组织农民进行搬砂、打石的副业生产，以储备砂、石。辽西省某地已储备砂子二十万立方公尺。某地方国营砂土矿公司已储备碴石十余万立方公尺，砂子六十万立方公尺。在小五金和水暖器材方面，中国工业器材公司东北区公司根据全区需要量已准备好了全部原料，协同各省市的经济计划委员会、工商局、工商业联合会等部门组织有加工订货力量的国营、地方国营以及私营小五金和水暖器材各工厂，按统一的新规格进行加工订货。沈阳市就动员了六百六十多家私营小五金和水暖器材工厂专为基本建设加工小五金和水暖器材。
    【又讯】沈阳市运输公司组织一万余辆胶轮马车和装货汽车，投入冬季运料工作，支援全市基本建设施工单位。这一强大的运输力量在去年十二月一个月中，就完成了五十六个基本建设单位全月的运料任务。
    沈阳市运输公司为鼓励各基本建设单位尽早提出托运计划，特规定了优待冬季运料的办法。目前已有一百零四个基本建设单位与该公司签订运输合同。为了保证首先完成主要工程的运输任务，该公司在去年十二月份起，把过去由所属各办事处受理货物、调配车辆的办法，改由公司业务科集中管理统一调配。这样，就大大提高了车辆的利用率，改变了过去由于分散调配车辆而造成的严重的车辆回空现象。
