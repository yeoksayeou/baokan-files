    Korean Central News Agency Publishes Commentary
    Denouncing US for Tearing Up Armistice Negotiation Agreement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 27th] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 25th, denouncing the American aggressors' plot to tear up the agreements already reached, in order to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression against Korea. The commentary pointed out: The US side unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations on October 8th of last year, and subsequently rejected the Soviet representative's proposal for an immediate ceasefire at the current UN General Assembly. On January 15th, the US side again declared that it would tear up the agreement reached by liaison officers of both sides on November 25th, 1951, not to attack the vehicles of both delegations, starting from January 25th. At the same time, the US side not only created a series of provocative incidents violating the neutral zone, but also carried out even more frantic bombing of our rear peaceful residential areas. The US side's purpose is clearly to completely destroy the armistice negotiations and expand the war. The commentary pointed out: The Korean people, together with the people of the world, are monitoring with the greatest vigilance the US side's actions of openly starting to expand the war. The commentary finally warned: The US side must understand that they absolutely cannot shirk the serious responsibility for openly destroying the agreement and the basis of the armistice negotiations, and must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    斥责美方撕毁停战谈判协议
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜中央通讯社在二十五日发表评论，斥责美国侵略者撕毁双方已经达成的协议，以便破坏朝鲜停战谈判、扩大侵朝战争的阴谋。评论指出：美方在去年十月八日片面中断了停战谈判，随后在本届联合国大会上拒绝了苏联代表关于立即停战的建议，一月十五日，美方又声明要从一月二十五日起撕毁一九五一年十一月二十五日双方联络官所达成的不袭击双方代表团车辆的协议。同时，美方不仅制造了一连串侵犯中立区的挑衅事件，而且又对我后方和平居民区施行更加疯狂的滥炸。美方的目的显然是要完全破坏停战谈判，扩大战争。评论指出：朝鲜人民和全世界人民在一起，正以最大的警惕监视着美方公然开始扩大战争的行动。评论最后警告说：美方要明白：它们绝对推卸不了公然破坏协议和停战谈判基础的严重责任，而且要对由此产生的一切后果负完全责任。
