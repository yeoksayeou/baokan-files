Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 7th: Increasingly, news is surfacing that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are stepping up activities to remilitarize Japan. However, this rearmament measure is meeting with increasing resistance due to strong opposition from the Japanese people.

Yoshida Cabinet Secretary-General Taketora Ogata recently admitted while meeting with reporters in Osaka that he knew, "the United States is urging Japan to openly accelerate rearmament." "The Japan Economic Newspaper" further revealed on the 3rd that although the Yoshida government denies rearmament, it has secretly drafted two rearmament plans. The newspaper said that these two plans are called the "Y Committee Plan" and the "Godo Plan." The former plan was formulated under the supervision of Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki by some former Japanese military experts and senior staff officers; the latter plan was drafted by Takao Godo, former Japanese Navy Vice Admiral (Technical Vice Admiral) and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Minister of Commerce and Industry of the wartime Abe Cabinet, who was personally and secretly invited by Yoshida. The "Y Committee Plan" calls for the formation of a new Japanese army of 300,000 men before 1955, and the "Godo Plan" also advocates the establishment of 15 divisions, 290,000 men, of the new Japanese army. As everyone knows, at present, the Yoshida government is actively preparing to expand the disguised army "Security Force" from 110,000 to 180,000 men this year.

Nevertheless, the Yoshida government is facing a serious crisis and difficulties in implementing the U.S. plan to openly accelerate Japan's rearmament. According to a Reuters Tokyo report, the rearmament issue "could cause Prime Minister Yoshida's government to collapse and be unable to recover." At present, the Yoshida government is already unstable. "Since the Yoshida government was elected with a narrow majority on October 1, opposition forces within Yoshida's own Liberal Party and external pressure have almost caused the government to collapse several times." Even if the American occupiers attempt to prop up another puppet to replace Yoshida in implementing the U.S. plan to remilitarize Japan, it will inevitably fail. The Reuters report said: "If the opposition party and the opposition within the Liberal Party bring down the government, then in the new election, that party will definitely fail if it openly raises difficult issues such as rearmament or seeks the electorate's mandate to implement the rumored U.S. demands." Because, among the Japanese people, "the majority still oppose rearmament" -- "Young people are very unwilling to be soldiers, and women voters -- who are the majority -- oppose conscription. Many ordinary voters are also afraid of anything that might revive extreme wartime militarism."

### 吉田执行美国重整军备计划阻力越来越大  路透社消息透露日本人民中多数反对重整军备

    吉田执行美国重整军备计划阻力越来越大
    路透社消息透露日本人民中多数反对重整军备
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：愈来愈多的消息暴露出来美、日反动派正在加紧进行使日本重新军国主义化的活动。但是，这一备战措施在日本人民的强烈反对下，所遭到的阻力也愈来愈大。
    吉田内阁书记长官绪方竹虎最近在大阪接见记者时承认，他知道，“美国催促日本公开地加速重整军备”。“日本经济新闻”在三日进一步透露，吉田政府虽然否认重整军备，但已秘密地拟制了两个重整军备的计划。该报说，这两个计划被称之为“Y·委员会计划”和“伍堂计划”。前一个计划是在外务相冈崎胜男监督下，由一些前日本军事专家和高级参谋军官制订出来的；后一个计划是吉田亲自秘密邀请前日本海军造兵中将（技术中将）、战时阿部内阁农林相兼商工相伍堂卓雄拟订的。“Y·委员会计划”要求在一九五五年以前组成一支三十万人的日本新陆军，“伍堂计划”也主张建立日本新陆军十五个师，二十九万人。大家知道，在目前，吉田政府正在积极准备在今年把变相的陆军“保安队”从十一万人扩充到十八万人。
    虽然如此，吉田政府在执行美国公开加速日本重整军备的计划上，正面临严重的危机和困难。据路透社东京消息说，重整军备问题“可以使吉田首相的政府垮台而且是一蹶不振”。在目前，吉田政府已经是基础不稳。“自从十月一日吉田政府以微弱多数当选以来，吉田自己的自由党内部的反对势力和外边的压力已有好几次几乎使政府垮台。”即使美国占领者企图另外抬出一具傀儡来代替吉田执行美国使日本重新军国主义化的计划，也必然会遭到失败。路透社的消息说：“如果反对党和自由党内的反对派把政府搞垮，那么在新的选举中，那一个党要把重整军备那样的难题公开提出来或者要争取选举人关于实现传说中的美国要求的委托，这个党就一定会失败。”因为，在日本人民当中，“反对重整军备的还是多数”——“青年都是很不愿当兵的，妇女选举人——她们是占多数的——是反对征兵的。许多普通选举人对于可能使极端的战时军国主义复活的任何东西也都害怕。”
