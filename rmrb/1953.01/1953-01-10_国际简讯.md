    The Number of U.S. Predatory Investments Abroad Soars

    The American magazine "Current Business," published in late December 1952, printed materials from the first post-war U.S. Department of Commerce table of direct U.S. foreign investment compiled in 1951. According to the published materials, at the end of 1950, direct U.S. foreign investment was $11,804,100,000, compared to $7.9 billion in 1943 and $6.7 billion at the end of 1936.

    Undoubtedly, every dollar of these investments is stained with the blood and sweat of the working people in capitalist countries and the people in colonial territories.

    The Outrageous and Shameless Behavior of U.S. Troops Stationed in Iceland

    Icelandic newspapers of various leanings are increasingly reporting on the arrogant behavior of U.S. troops stationed in Iceland and their outrageous and shameless American lifestyle. The newspapers write that U.S. soldiers are corrupting Icelandic girls, teaching young people to drink strong liquor and use narcotics. "Tíminn" complains that the presence of U.S. soldiers in Iceland "has increased the number of crimes committed by Icelandic youth." The paper writes: "Keflavik (the site of the U.S. military base) is a den of vice, and moral degradation will spread throughout the country within two or three years." "Fjallskugginn" reports that prostitution has appeared in Reykjavík.

    Icelandic patriots will deal with these purveyors of "American lifestyles" in an appropriate manner.

    Exposing Attlee's Lies

    British Labour Party leader Clement Attlee, on his way from London to Rangoon in early January to attend the Asian Socialist Conference, delivered speeches in Karachi, Delhi, and Calcutta, touting the "democracy" and "love of freedom" of the British Labour Party, insisting that the British Labour Party had transformed the British Empire into a federation, which meant cooperation among "equal partners."

    This is a complete and utter lie.

    The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article by Prishevsky, exposing Attlee's lies. He wrote, does Attlee really think that the people of Asian countries have forgotten the oppression of British imperialism, forgotten the prisons of British colonizers, and forgotten the rivers of blood caused by British suppression of popular uprisings for independence?

    The author pointed out that Attlee attended the Asian Socialist Conference in Rangoon to persuade them to join the "Socialist International." Attlee attempted to influence Asian socialists with sensationalist remarks, directing them to carry out activities against the progressive forces fighting for national independence and national sovereignty.

    国际简讯
    美国在海外掠夺性投资数目激增
    一九五二年十二月下旬出版的美国“商业现况”杂志刊载了美国商务部在一九五一年所作的战后第一个美国国外直接投资表的材料。根据公布材料，到一九五○年年底，美国国外直接投资是一百一十八亿零四百一十万美元，而在一九四三年是七十九亿美元，在一九三六年年底是六十七亿美元。
    无疑地，在这些投资的每一块美元上，都沾满了资本主义国家劳动人民与殖民地人民的血和汗。
    驻冰岛美军的荒淫无耻行为
    冰岛具有各种不同倾向的报纸，都愈来愈频繁地报道驻在冰岛的美军的傲慢行为及其荒淫无耻的美国生活习惯。报纸写道：美国兵使冰岛少女堕落，教青年人饮烈性酒和服用麻醉剂。“提明报”控诉说：美国兵留驻在冰岛国内“已使冰岛青年人犯罪的数目增加了。”该报写道：“凯夫拉维克（美军驻地）是万恶之薮，精神上的堕落在两三年内就会蔓延全国。”“夫里雅尔斯·特约得报”报道，雷克雅未克地方已出现私娼。
    冰岛爱国者是会以适当的方式来对待这些“美国生活方式”的传播者的。
    揭穿艾德礼的谎言
    英国工党领袖艾德礼在一月初从伦敦到仰光出席亚洲社会党会议的途中在喀喇蚩、德里和加尔各答曾发表演说，鼓吹英国工党的“民主”和“热爱自由”，硬说英国工党已把大英帝国变成了一个联邦，而这就意味着“平等伙友”的合作。
    这完全是弥天大谎。
    苏联“真理报”上发表了普利舍夫斯基的专文，揭穿了艾德礼的谎言，他写道，艾德礼果真以为亚洲各国人民已经忘记了英帝国主义的压迫，忘记了英国殖民者的监狱和英国镇压人民独立起义时所造成的血流成河的惨象吗？
    作者指出：艾德礼到仰光出席亚洲社会党会议是为了去劝使他们参加“社会党国际”。艾德礼企图用哗众取宠的言论影响亚洲社会党人，指使他们进行活动，反对为民族独立和国家主权而战斗着的进步力量。
