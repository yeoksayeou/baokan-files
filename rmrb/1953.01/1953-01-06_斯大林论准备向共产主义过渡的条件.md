    Stalin on the Conditions for Preparing the Transition to Communism
    Soviet Union, Sijiepan Ning
    The Soviet people, full of vitality and deeply convinced of the victory of their cause, are building the magnificent edifice of communism under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party.
    All the practical activities of our Party and its plans for the future rely on the knowledge of economic laws, and on the science of communist social construction formulated by Comrade Stalin.
    Stalin, the great master of science, summarized the experience of the revolutionary creation of the masses and constantly developed and enriched the theory of scientific communism. A new era in the development of Marxism-Leninism—the era of the victory of socialism and the construction of communism in the Soviet Union, and the era of the victory of the people's democratic system in many countries in Europe and Asia—is inseparable from the name of Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is an outstanding contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and a programmatic document of scientific communism. This book summarizes the great experience of the victorious construction of socialism in the Soviet Union and provides a profound scientific argument for the gradual transition from socialism to communism.
    The principles expressed by Comrade Stalin in his works are the theoretical foundation of the historic resolutions of the 19th Party Congress. The congress stipulated the main tasks of the Party at the present stage, and adopted the instructions for the Fifth Five-Year Plan; and the realization of this plan is a new and great step on the road of the Soviet society's development towards communism.
    The Lenin-Stalin Party is organizing the victorious construction of communism by relying on the socialist mode of production that has been established and consolidated in our country, and on the superiority of the Soviet social and state system. Comrade Stalin taught that in order to reach the higher stage of communism, society must go through a series of stages of economic and cultural transformation. Comrade Stalin, for the first time in the history of Marxism, expressed those programmatic principles regarding the three basic prerequisites for preparing the transition to communism.
    These programmatic principles, which reflect the mature tasks of the material development of Soviet society, take as their starting point the fundamental economic law of socialism discovered by Comrade Stalin. As Comrade Stalin pointed out, the main characteristics and requirements of this law can be roughly expressed as follows: to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of advanced technology.
    The Continuous Growth of All Social Production
    Comrade Stalin taught that in order to prepare for the transition to communism, the first thing that must be "effectively guaranteed...is the continuous growth of all social production, with the growth of the production of the means of production taking precedence."
    The starting point of Marxism is that production plays a major and decisive role in the development of any society, including socialist society.
    One of the most important characteristics of socialist society is the continuous growth of all social production. While capitalist production develops extremely unevenly, and is subjected to the destructive influence of competition and production anarchy and crises, socialist production is constantly developing along an upward path. During the period from 1929 to 1951, the total output of Soviet industrial products increased almost thirteen times.
    Such a high rate of production growth is unprecedented in world history. For example, in the United States, during the period from 1929 to 1939, industrial production remained stagnant; later, only due to the rapid expansion of military production did industrial production increase, thus in 1951, industrial production doubled compared to 1929. However, this one-sided growth, generated on the basis of militarization and unrelated to the consumption of residents, will inevitably lead to a new economic crisis.
    Under the socialist system, social production obtains comprehensive development in accordance with the basic economic law of socialism. The Fifth Soviet Development Five-Year Plan, which stipulates the new and huge development of all sectors of the national economy and culture, is a vivid confirmation of this matter.
    Stalin's program for communist construction starts from the point that it is necessary to give priority to the growth of the production of the means of production, which is the most important condition for expanded reproduction. In order to guarantee the machinery equipment of the departments that produce the means of production and all the departments that produce consumer goods, the priority growth of the production of the means of production is necessary.
    The priority growth of the means of production, and above all the production of the machine-building industry, is the basis of all the Five-Year Plans (including the Fifth Five-Year Plan). In the new Five-Year Plan, the overall level of industrial production will increase by approximately 70 percent, while the production of machine-building products will increase by approximately 200 percent. The growth rate of those types of machine-building industry that are directly related to the establishment of advanced communist technology is particularly rapid. For example, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the production of hydraulic turbines will increase by 330 percent. The most important link in establishing the material production base of communism is the electrification of the country. In realizing the magnificent program of electrification, the Party starts from Lenin's only correct formula, which is: communism is Soviet power plus nationwide electrification.
    Continuous technological progress requires the replacement of old technology with new technology, and the replacement of new technology with the latest technology. As everyone knows, in the recent five or six years, all departments of the machine-building industry have almost completely renovated the types of machinery and equipment they produce. In the struggle to further improve technology, Soviet science plays an important role. Our scholars, in creative friendship and cooperation with production department staff, help discover and better utilize the resources and power of nature with their own discoveries, and push forward all sectors of the national economy.
    The priority growth of the production of the means of production guarantees the expansion of reproduction, guarantees the continuous growth of all social production, and prepares the prerequisites for the transition from the two basic production sectors in the national economy—the state-owned and the collective farm-owned—to a unified, all-inclusive production sector.

    Raising Collective Farm Ownership to the Level of Ownership by the Whole People
    When stipulating the second basic condition for preparing the transition to communism, Comrade Stalin instructed that, secondly, it is necessary "to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people by implementing gradual transitional methods that are beneficial to the collective farms and thus also beneficial to the entire society, and also to replace commodity circulation with a gradual transition to a system of product exchange..."
    The mission of this condition, in conjunction with other conditions, is to advance the productive forces, develop and improve production relations, and guarantee the economic transformation of society.
    Our current production relations are fully adapted to the growth of the productive forces, thereby advancing the productive forces by leaps and bounds. But this does not mean that there is no contradiction between production relations and productive forces, because even under socialist conditions, production relations still lag behind the development of productive forces.
    At present, collective farm ownership and commodity circulation are being successfully used to develop the socialist economy. Even in the near future, they will still benefit our country. Therefore, the Party is struggling to consolidate and maximize the development of collective farm production as a necessary prerequisite for the transition to a higher form of economic development. However, at present, collective farm ownership and commodity circulation are beginning to hinder the strong development of productive forces.
    The narrow scope of collective farm group ownership does not provide the necessary broad space for the further comprehensive development of productive forces, it limits the possibility of applying large-scale machinery and equipment, and it limits the realization of full electrification of the entire national economy.
    The contradiction between the growth of productive forces and the current production relations is also specifically reflected in planning. Within the scope of ownership by the whole people, we use state planning to fully include all aspects of production and distribution. Within the scope of collective farm group ownership, state planning does not have this all-inclusive situation.
    In order to overcome this contradiction, it is necessary to gradually transform collective farm ownership into ownership by the whole people, and to replace commodity circulation with a system of product exchange. Comrade Stalin wrote:
    "In order to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, it is necessary to exclude the surplus products of collective farm production from the commodity circulation system and include them in the product exchange system between state industry and collective farms. The essence of the problem lies here."
    If the building of socialism requires the establishment of public ownership not only in industry but also in agriculture, then the building of communism requires the establishment of unified, all-inclusive production by raising collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people.
    Among all the measures to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, the most important link is to develop the product exchange system on the basis of the continuous rise of all social production. The product exchange system is a higher form of economic connection between industry and agriculture. Stalin foresightedly saw the seeds of the future product exchange system in the existing practice of "barter", and saw the progressive tendency of economic development on the road to communism. Comrade Stalin instructed that the product exchange system requires a large increase in the products sent by cities to rural areas, therefore, there is no need to be particularly hasty in implementing this system, which should depend on the degree of accumulation of manufactured products in the city. But this system should be implemented unswervingly and without hesitation, gradually narrowing the scope of commodity circulation and expanding the scope of product exchange.
    In this discovery, we once again see the power of Stalin's scientific foresight.
    Raising collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people is the most important condition for eliminating the essential differences between cities and villages. If the victory of socialism eliminates the historical contradictions between cities and villages, then the victory of communism is unimaginable if the essential differences between cities and villages are not eliminated.

    The Cultural Development of Society
    Comrade Stalin taught that in order to prepare for the transition to communism, thirdly, it is necessary "to bring society to such a high level of cultural development as will ensure all members of society the all-round development of their physical and mental powers, so that the members of society may be in a position to receive an education sufficient to become active agents of social development, and be able freely to choose their occupations and not be tied down for life, owing to the existing division of labor, to some one occupation."
    The completion of this task will mean that the spiritual preconditions have been created for the transition to the higher stage of communism.
    Comrade Stalin instructed that in order to achieve this, it is necessary to reduce the daily working hours to at least six hours, and then to five hours, so that members of society have sufficient free time necessary to obtain a comprehensive education. Communism presupposes this reduction in working hours, because this reduction is necessary for the all-round development of the individual. Marx pointed out long ago that under the future system, everyone's "free time will increase" and "by then, the mark of wealth will not be working time, but free time." Under the socialist system, the increase in free time and the growth and improvement of all social production are directly linked together.
    In order to enable the masses to obtain further strong cultural development, it is also necessary to implement universal compulsory polytechnical education so that members of society can freely choose their occupations. In the resolution of the 19th Party Congress, the issue of transitioning to universal ten-year education and implementing universal polytechnical education in schools was considered a mature practical task.
    Comrade Stalin instructed that fundamentally improving living conditions, increasing the real wages of workers and staff by at least doubling them by directly increasing monetary wages, and especially by continuing to lower prices, is of the most important significance for the cultural development of society. The resolution of the 19th Party Congress, fully in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions, provided a plan for further improving the material welfare and culture of laborers, and widely expanding housing construction.
    The victory of socialism has eliminated the opposition between manual labor and mental labor. The practice of socialist construction has raised a new issue—the elimination of the essential difference between mental labor and manual labor. With the resolution of this issue, the difference between the working class, the peasantry and the intellectuals on the other hand will also disappear.

    ×××
    In the process of realizing all the prerequisites for the transition to communism, labor productivity will continue to increase, the material production base will have huge growth, and material data will truly become enriched.
    In the future, the Party will also implement Stalin's policy of further consolidating the economic strength of the Soviet state and increasing domestic productive forces in order to create abundant material data.
    Stalin's discussion on the prerequisites for preparing the transition to communism has great theoretical and practical significance. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the transition from socialism to communism requires gradual preparation. He insisted on warning against rashly running too far ahead and transitioning to a higher economic form without creating the necessary prerequisites in advance.
    When revealing the prospects for the transition to the higher stage of communism, Comrade Stalin instructed that only after all these prerequisites have been fully realized can we hope that labor will become the first need in life in the face of society, and can we hope that public ownership will be regarded by all members of society as an unshakable and inviolable foundation of social existence.
    "Only after all these prerequisites have been fully realized can we transition from the socialist formula 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work' to the communist formula 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.' This will be a fundamental transition from one economy, namely the socialist economy, to another higher economy, namely the communist economy."
    Our country's communist construction is of great international significance; it consolidates the strength of democracy and socialism throughout the world, and accelerates the forward development of society.
    The Party, armed with the ever-victorious doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, is unswervingly implementing the correct policy that conforms to the vital interests of Soviet society. It is consolidating the power of the Soviet state, which is the main tool for building communism, in every possible way.
    The Lenin-Stalin Party knows how to lead professionals and is successfully leading its cause forward.
    Stalin's genius has illuminated the road to the victory of communism for the Soviet people.

    斯大林论准备向共产主义过渡的条件
    苏联  斯杰潘宁
    充满了生命力并对本身事业之胜利抱有深刻信念的苏维埃人民，正在列宁—斯大林党的领导下建筑着宏壮的共产主义的殿堂。
    我党的全部实际活动，它对于未来的计划所依靠的就是经济法则的知识，就是斯大林同志所制定的关于共产主义社会建设的科学。
    科学的伟大匠师斯大林同志综括了群众革命创造的经验，而把科学的共产主义的理论不断地加以发展和丰富。马克思列宁主义发展中的新时代——在苏联、社会主义胜利和共产主义建设的时代，在欧洲和亚洲的许多国家中、人民民主制度取得胜利的时代——是和斯大林同志的名字分不开的。斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是对于马克思列宁主义宝库的一个杰出的贡献、是科学的共产主义的纲领性的文献。在这本书里综括了苏联胜利地建设社会主义的巨大经验，对于从社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡的道路作了深刻的科学论证。
    斯大林同志在他的著作中所表述的那些原理是第十九次党代表大会的历史性决议的理论基础。大会规定了党在现阶段的主要任务，通过了对于第五个五年计划的指示；而这一计划的实现就是苏维埃社会向共产主义发展道路上的新的、巨大的一步。
    列宁—斯大林党依靠着在我国已经确立并巩固了的社会主义生产方式，依靠着苏维埃社会和国家制度的优越性而在组织着胜利的共产主义建设。斯大林同志教导说，为了要达到共产主义的更高的阶段，社会必须经过一系列的经济改造和文化改造阶段。斯大林同志在马克思主义的历史中第一次表述了关于准备向共产主义过渡的三个基本先决条件的那些纲领性的原理。
    反映了苏维埃社会物质发展的已经成熟的各项任务的这些纲领性的原理，是以斯大林同志所发现的社会主义根本经济法则为出发点的。正如斯大林同志所指出的，这一法则的主要特点和要求可以大致表述如下：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    全部社会生产的不断增长
    斯大林同志教导说，为了准备过渡到共产主义，首先必须“切实加以保证的……是全部社会生产的不断增长，而生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位”。
    马克思主义的出发点就是，生产在任何社会（其中也包括社会主义社会）的发展中都起着主要的、决定性的作用。
    社会主义社会最重要的特点之一，就是全部社会生产的不断增长。正当资本主义的生产发展得极不均衡，受着竞争和生产无政府状态以及危机的破坏性的影响时，社会主义的生产却在沿着上升的路线不断发展着。在一九二九年到一九五一年的这一阶段当中，苏联工业产品的总产量差不多增加到十三倍。
    生产增长上的这样高的速度在世界历史上是空前的。例如在美国，在一九二九年到一九三九年这一阶段当中，工业生产始终是停滞在原来的地方；后来只是由于军事生产的急剧扩大工业生产才提高，从而在一九五一年比起一九二九年来工业生产增加了一倍。但是这片面的、在军事化基础上产生的而且是和居民的消费无涉的生产的某些增长，不可避免地又会引起新的经济危机。
    在社会主义制度下，社会生产适应着社会主义的基本经济法则而获得全面的发展。规定了国民经济和文化的一切部门的新的巨大发展的第五个苏联发展五年计划，就是这件事的一个鲜明的证实。
    斯大林的共产主义建设纲领是从这一点出发的，那就是必须要优先地使作为扩大再生产的最重要条件的生产资料底生产获得增长，为了要保证生产生产资料的部门和生产消费品的一切部门以机器装备，生产资料生产的优先增长是必要的。
    生产资料、而首先是机器制造业生产的优先增长就是历次五年计划（其中包括第五个五年计划）的基础。在新的五年计划里面，工业生产水平总起来大约要提高百分之七十，而机器制造业产品的生产大约要增加为百分之二百。直接与共产主义高度技术的建立有关的那些种类的机器制造业的增长速度则又特别迅速。例如，在第五个五年计划当中，水力透平的生产要增加百分之三百三十。在建立共产主义物质生产基础时，其最重要的一个环节就是国家的电气化。在实现电气化的宏伟纲领时，党是从唯一正确的列宁的公式出发的，这公式是：共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化。
    技术上不断的进步，要求用新的技术代替旧的技术，要求用最新的技术来代替新的技术。大家知道，在最近的五六年当中，机器制造业的一切部门把所生产的机器设备的名目差不多全部革新了。在争取进一步改善技术的斗争中，苏维埃科学起着重要的作用。我国的学者们，在与生产部门工作人员创造性的友谊合作之下，以其本身的发现帮助发现并更好地利用自然界的富源和力量，把国民经济的一切部门向前推进。
    生产资料生产的优先增长保证了再生产的扩大，保证了全部社会生产的不断增长，准备了从国民经济中的两个基本生产部门——国家的与集体农庄的——向统一的、无所不包的生产部门的过渡的前提。
    把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平
    斯大林同志在规定准备向共产主义过渡的第二个基本条件时，指示说，第二，必须“用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使产品交换制来代替商品流通……”
    与其他条件相配合的这一条件的使命，就是要把生产力向前推进，发展并改善生产关系，保证社会的经济改造。
    我国现在的生产关系完全适合于生产力的增长，从而就一日千里地把生产力向前推进。但这决不是说在生产关系和生产力之间就并不存在着某种的矛盾，因为就是在社会主义的条件下，生产关系还是落后于生产力的发展的。
    现在集体农庄所有制和商品流通是顺利地被利用来发展社会主义经济。就是在最近的将来，它们还会给我国带来利益。因此党便为了争取巩固和尽量发展作为向经济发展更高形态过渡的必要前提的集体农庄生产而进行着斗争。但是现在集体农庄所有制和商品流通却在开始阻碍着生产力的强力发展了。
    集体农庄集团所有制的狭窄范围并没有为生产力的进一步的全面发展提供必要的广阔场所，它限制了应用大规模机器设备的可能性，限制了全部国民经济充分电气化的实现。
    生产力的增长和现在的生产关系中间的矛盾也具体地反映在计划化方面。在全民所有制的范围以内，我们是由国家计划化来完全包括生产与分配的一切环节。在集体农庄集团所有制的范围以内，国家计划化便没有这种包括一切的情形。
    为了要克服这一矛盾，就必须要逐渐地把集体农庄所有制变成全民所有制，并且用产品交换制来代替商品流通。斯大林同志写道：
    “为了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的
    水平，必须将集体农庄生产的剩余品从商品流通
    系统中排除出去，把它们列入国家工业和集体
    农庄间的产品交换系统中。问题的实质就在这
    里。”
    如果社会主义的建成要求不单是在工业，而且是在农业里建立公有制时，那么共产主义的建成就要求用提高集体农庄所有制到全民所有制水平的办法来建立统一的、无所不包的生产。
    在提高集体农庄所有制到全民所有制水平的一切措施中，最重要的一个环节就是在全部社会生产不断高涨的基础上发展产品交换制。产品交换制是工业与农业之间经济联系的更高的形态。斯大林就在现存的“换货”的实践中先见之明地看到了未来产品交换制的萌芽，看到了向共产主义道路的经济发展的进步倾向。斯大林同志指示说，产品交换制度需要大量增加城市送交农村的产品，所以，推行这种制度无需特别急忙，要随着城市制成品的积累的程度而定。但是应该一往直前、毫不犹豫地推行这种制度，一步一步地缩小商品流通的活动范围，扩大产品交换的活动范围。
    在这一发现中，我们再度看到了斯大林的科学预见的力量。
    把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，是消灭城市和乡村之间本质差别的最重要的条件。如果社会主义的胜利消灭了城市与乡村间的历来矛盾的话，那么城市与乡村之间的本质差别如不消灭，共产主义的胜利就是不可想像的。
    社会的文化发展
    斯大林同志教导说，为了准备过渡到共产主义，第三，必须“使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的体力和智力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的劳动分工而终身束缚于某一种职业”。
    这一任务的完成，将表示已经为向共产主义更高阶段的过渡，创造了精神上的前提。
    斯大林同志指示说，要作到这点，就需要把每天的劳动时间至少缩短到六小时，然后再缩短到五小时，以便使社会成员有为获得全面教育所必需的充分的自由时间。共产主义预先规定了工作时间的这种缩短，因为这种缩短对于个人的全面发展是必要的。马克思早就指出说，在未来的制度下大家的“自由时间都会增加”而“到那时，财富的标志将不是工作的时间，而是自由的时间了”。在社会主义制度下，自由时间的增加和全部社会生产的增长与改进是直接地联系在一起的。
    为了使群众获得进一步的强力的文化发展，此外就需要实行普及义务的综合技术教育，以便使社会成员有可能自由选择职业。在第十九次党代表大会的决议中，关于向普及十年制教育的过渡和学校中实现普及综合技术教育的问题，被认为是成熟了的实际任务。
    斯大林同志指示说，根本改善居住条件，用直接提高货币工资，而且特别是用继续不断地降低物价的办法，把工人和职员的实际工资至少提高一倍，对于社会的文化发展，具有最重要的意义。第十九次党代表大会的决议，完全遵照着斯大林同志的指示，提供了进一步提高劳动者的物质福利和文化、广泛展开住宅建设的计划。
    社会主义的胜利使体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的对立消灭了。社会主义建设的实践提出了一个新的问题——脑力劳动和体力劳动之间本质差别的消灭。随着这一问题的解决，一方面工人阶级、农民和另一方面知识分子之间的差别也就会消失了。
            ×××
    在向共产主义过渡的全部先决条件的实现过程中，劳动生产率将要一直不断地继续提高，物质生产基础将要有巨大的增长，物质资料将要真正地丰富起来。
    党在今后也要执行进一步巩固苏维埃国家的经济实力，为了创造富裕的物质资料而提高国内生产力的斯大林政策。
    斯大林关于准备向共产主义过渡的先决条件的论述，具有巨大的理论和实践的意义。斯大林同志指出说，从社会主义向共产主义的过渡，需要逐步的准备。他坚持地警告说不要轻率地跑得太前了，不要在没有预先创造必要前提的时候就过渡到更高级的经济形态上面去。
    斯大林同志在揭示向共产主义更高阶段的过渡的远景时指示说，只有把这一切先决条件全部实现以后，才可以希望，劳动将在社会面前变成生活的第一需要，才可以希望公有制将被社会全体成员看作是社会存在的不可动摇和不可侵犯的基础。
    “只有把这一切先决条件全部实现之后，才可
    以从社会主义的公式‘各尽所能，按劳取酬’，
    过渡到共产主义的公式‘各尽所能，各取所需’。
    这将是从一种经济即社会主义经济到另一种更
    高的经济即共产主义经济的根本过渡”。
    我国的共产主义建设是具有重大国际意义的；它巩固了全世界民主与社会主义的力量，加速了社会的一往直前的发展。
    为马克思列宁主义百战百胜的学说武装起来的党，始终不渝地在实现着符合于苏维埃社会切身利益的正确政策。它用一切方法巩固着作为建成共产主义的主要工具的苏维埃国家的威力。
    列宁—斯大林的党知道怎样领导专业，并且正在顺利地领导着自己的事业前进。
    斯大林的天才为苏维埃人民照明了通向共产主义胜利的道路。
