    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. TASS reports: On the 27th, the newspaper Labor published an article by A. Manukyan commenting on the development of the Soviet and capitalist countries' national economies in 1952.

    The author pointed out that the Soviet Union's total industrial output in 1951 was 1266 percent of that in 1929, an increase of almost twelve times. In contrast, the industrial output of the two major capitalist countries, the United States and Britain, in 1951 was only 200 percent and 160 percent of the 1929 level, respectively. Even at this level, capitalist countries could only achieve it through frantic military expansion, a predatory intervention in Korea, and preparations for a new world war. Taking 1929 as 100, the Soviet Union's industrial output reached 1405 in 1952. However, the industrial output of the United States and Britain was even lower than in 1951. According to preliminary estimates, with 1929 as 100, the United States was about 198 and Britain was about 156 in 1952. The enormous gap created by the rapid development of Soviet industrial production and the stagnation of industrial production in capitalist countries became even more significant in 1952. Due to the increased production of armaments failing to compensate for the reduction in civilian production, the total industrial output of the United States not only did not increase but decreased. In contrast, the output of all kinds of industries in the Soviet Union continued to increase.

    Manukyan then discussed the inevitable consequences of the world's two parallel lines of development. He said that these two lines of development are, on the one hand, the rapid and steady progress of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and on the other hand, the capitalist countries, after temporary and insignificant progress, are followed by a sharp decline and long-term stagnation.

    When talking about the situation in capitalist countries, Manukyan pointed out that, on the one hand, the imperialist countries' arms expansion movement not only could not increase industrial production, but even failed to prevent the reduction of industrial production. On the other hand, the arms expansion movement brought maximum profits to the monopoly capitalists. In 1952, the profits of American companies reached 41 to 42 billion US dollars, the same as the previous year, an increase of 75 percent compared to the maximum profits in 1943. American monopoly capitalists made a large amount of bloody profits in the two and a half years after the start of the Korean War, the amount of which was almost equal to the profits obtained during the five years of the Second World War. American and British monopoly capitalists seek maximum profits by exploiting the majority of residents in the United States and Britain and bankrupting and impoverishing them, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially backward countries, and finally by war and the militarization of the national economy. In 1952, the constantly increasing military expenditures of various capitalist countries reached a very high level. At the same time, 1952 was also the year when retail prices reached the highest level, the year when devalued paper money was issued the most, and the year when taxes and national debts reached the highest level. According to officially published statistics, since the start of the war of aggression against Korea, the retail prices (i.e., the cost of living) in various capitalist countries have risen without exception. The degree of retail price increases varies, from 10 percent in the Netherlands to 73 percent in Argentina. If we remember that bourgeois statistics often fabricate a set of unprecedented deceptive lies in this regard in order to cover up the truth, then we can easily appropriately estimate the full significance of the figures cited. In addition, monopoly capitalists are not satisfied with various indirect methods of intensifying exploitation, they directly targeted wages.

    Manukyan then cited some figures to illustrate that, contrary to the situation in various capitalist countries, the Soviet Union further greatly improved the material and cultural living standards in 1952 on the basis of the development and improvement of socialist production.

    Manukyan concluded by writing that the constructive labor achievements made by the Soviet people in 1952 clearly proved the decisive superiority of the socialist economic system over the decadent and inevitably dying capitalist system. The Soviet people greet the future with confidence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are methodically improving the productivity of their free and creative labor, and are constantly strengthening the power of the world's peace fortress—the Soviet Union.

    社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度的证明
    苏联国民经济不断向上发展
    美英等资本主义国家工业生产长期停滞
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十七日劳动报发表了阿·马努基扬评论一九五二年苏联和资本主义国家国民经济发展的一篇文章。
    作者指出：苏联一九五一年的工业总产量为一九二九年的百分之一千二百六十六，差不多增加了十二倍。而美英两大资本主义国家一九五一年的工业产量各为一九二九年水平的百分之二百和百分之一百六十。然而即使是这样的水平，资本主义国家还只有通过疯狂的扩张军备、在朝鲜进行掠夺性的干涉和准备新世界大战才能获得。如以一九二九年为一百，苏联在一九五二年的工业产量达到了一千四百零五。而美国和英国的工业产量却比一九五一年更低了。据初步的估计，以一九二九年为一百，一九五二年美国约为一百九十八，英国约为一百五十六。苏联工业生产的飞跃发展和资本主义国家工业的停滞不前所造成的巨大的距离，在一九五二年变得更为显著了。由于军备生产的增加补偿不了民用生产的削减，美国工业总产量不但没有增加而且减少了，与此相反，苏联的各种工业的产量却都继续增加了。
    马努基扬接着谈述了世界上两条平行发展路线的必然后果。他说：这两条发展路线是，一方面是苏联和人民民主国家的迅速稳步的进展，另一方面是资本主义国家在暂时的、微不足道的进展后，就继之以急剧的下降和长期的停滞不前。
    马努基扬谈到资本主义国家的情况时指出：一方面，帝国主义国家的扩张军备运动不但不能提高工业生产，甚至无法防止工业生产的减缩。另一方面，扩张军备运动为垄断资本家带来了最大限度的利润。一九五二年，美国各公司的利润和前一年一样达到了四百一十亿——四百二十亿美元，比一九四三年的最大限度的利润增加了百分之七十五。美国垄断资本家在朝鲜战争开始后的两年半中，捞了一大笔血腥的利润，其数额差不多等于第二次世界大战中五年期间所取得的利润。美英垄断资本家用剥削美英两国大多数居民并使之破产和穷困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家、特别是落后国家的人民的办法，最后用战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来谋取最大限度的利润，一九五二年，各资本主义国家不断增加的军事费用已达到非常高的水平。同时，一九五二年还是零售价格达到最高水平的一年，贬值纸币发行得最多的一年，赋税和国债达到最高水平的一年。根据官方公布的统计数字，自从侵朝战争开始以来，各资本主义国家的零售价格（即生活费用）都毫无例外地上涨了。零售价格上涨的程度各有不同，从荷兰上涨百分之十到阿根廷上涨百分之七十三。如果我们记得，资产阶级的统计为了掩饰真相往往在这一方面编造一套破天荒的骗人谎言，那末，我们就不难于适当地估计所举出的数字的全部意义了。此外，垄断资本家还并不满足于各种加紧剥削的间接办法，他们更直接在工资上打了主意。
    马努基扬接着举出了一些数字来说明：与各资本主义国家的情况相反，苏联一九五二年在社会主义生产的发展和趋于完善的基础上，进一步大大提高了物质生活和文化水平。
    马努基扬最后写道：苏联人民在一九五二年所取得的建设性的劳动成果清楚地证明了：社会主义经济制度，较之腐朽的必然灭亡的资本主义制度所具有的决定性的优越性。苏联人民满怀信心地迎接将来。苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下正在有步骤地提高他们自由的、创造性的劳动的生产率，正在不断加强世界和平堡垒——苏联的力量。
