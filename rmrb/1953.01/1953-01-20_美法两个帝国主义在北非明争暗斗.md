    The United States and French Imperialism Struggle Overtly and Covertly in North Africa

    According to the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" correspondent in Tangier, "In French North Africa, relations between the United States and France have deteriorated." The reporter wrote, "It seems that the French suspect that the Americans intend to squeeze them out...The French have informally protested against the work of our intelligence agencies in Morocco, demanding that we collect intelligence from the French secret police. French officials have hinted that the United States is encouraging nationalists to revolt against French rule not only in French Morocco but also in Tunisia."

    As the crisis of the colonial system deepens, this overt and covert struggle within the imperialist bloc will become more and more intense day by day.

    美法两个帝国主义在北非明争暗斗
    据美国的“纽约世界电讯太阳报”驻丹吉尔记者指出：“在法属北非，美、法两国关系已经日益恶化。”这个记者写道：“看来法国人在怀疑美国人打算把他们挤出去……法国人非正式地抗议我国的情报机关在摩洛哥工作，要求我们从法国秘密警察手里搜集情报。法国官吏已经暗示说：美国不但在法属摩洛哥而且在突尼斯鼓励民族主义者反抗法国的统治。”
    随着殖民制度危机的加深，帝国主义集团的这种明争暗斗还会一天比一天更激烈。
