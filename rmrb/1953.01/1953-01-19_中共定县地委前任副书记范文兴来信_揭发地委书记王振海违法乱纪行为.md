    Former Deputy Secretary of the CPC Ding County Prefectural Committee, Fan Wenxing, Writes a Letter
    Exposing Illegal and Disciplined Behavior of Prefectural Committee Secretary Wang Zhenhai
    Editor's Note: The facts exposed by Comrade Fan Wenxing, former Deputy Secretary of the CPC Ding County Prefectural Committee, regarding the shielding of landlord in-laws and the plot to harm Comrade Li Xiaoliu, a member of the Dongniu Village branch in Wuji County, by Prefectural Committee Secretary Wang Zhenhai, should be brought to our serious attention. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC should immediately and severely deal with Wang Zhenhai's illegal and undisciplined behavior and publish the results in the newspaper.

    To the Editor: I am the former Deputy Secretary of the CPC Ding County Prefectural Committee in Hebei Province and have now been transferred to work in Beijing. During my time working at the Ding County Prefectural Committee, I had a long-standing dispute with several members of the Prefectural Committee over a major issue that remains unresolved. The issue in dispute is truly appalling. That is the serious incident of Wang Zhenhai, Secretary of the CPC Ding County Prefectural Committee, colluding with and shielding landlord element Li Baixue, and plotting to murder Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu. I am now raising this matter with you and request that the relevant authorities resolve it promptly.

    Why did Prefectural Committee Secretary Wang Zhenhai try so hard to collude with landlord Li Baixue to frame Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu? To better explain the issue, I will first introduce the situation of Comrade Li Xiaoliu.

    Comrade Li Xiaoliu is from Dongniu Village, Wuji County, Hebei Province (the same village as landlord Li Baixue). He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1929. As early as when he was studying at Ding County Simple Teachers School, he led students in revolutionary work and was arrested and imprisoned by the Kuomintang for several years. In 1931, he re-established contact with local revolutionary comrades and carried out temple fair propaganda. In 1939, he was introduced by Comrade Niu Zhen (Chief of Staff of the Hebei Provincial Military Region) to do intelligence reconnaissance work in the 7th Military Sub-district of the former Ji-Zhong District. He worked very actively, but unfortunately, he was captured by the Japanese invaders in 1942 and imprisoned for several years, eventually being sent to Japan for several months before being released after Japan's surrender. After returning to China, he continued to actively participate in revolutionary work. In 1947, he was re-admitted to the Party by Ma Yinhu, a Party member from Dongniu Village, and later participated in land reform work, serving as the village head of Dongniu Village. Within the Party, he was elected as a member of the Dongniu Village Branch Committee of the CPC, and he actively led the village's poor peasant association in the struggle against landlords.

    Wang Zhenhai's father-in-law, Li Baixue, is a landlord in Dongniu Village. Li Xiaoliu once led the poor peasant association to struggle against Li Baixue. At that time, Wang Zhenhai's wife, Zhang Ying (a pseudonym), was the Organization Committee Member of the Chengguan District Committee of the CPC in Anguo County, and she tried her best to protect her landlord family, using despicable means such as fake divisions of property and transfers of assets to evade mass struggle. She even registered Wang Zhenhai to receive land from the landlord's family (Wang Zhenhai received three shares of land: one from his landlord father-in-law's family and two from his own village). During the re-examination of the land reform, Zhang Ying made a self-criticism under mass pressure, but from then on, she harbored prejudices against Comrade Li Xiaoliu and threatened him, saying, "Do you think you can be the village head forever!? If I can't bring you down, I'm not a Li!" At this time, landlord Li Baixue often came to the Prefectural Committee offices to find Wang Zhenhai. Wang Zhenhai was very dissatisfied with the Party organization in Dongniu Village, especially with Li Xiaoliu. He often said to us members of the Prefectural Committee, "The Dongniu Village Party branch in Wuji County is impure and controlled by traitors and feudal forces!" He maliciously fabricated facts to slander Li Xiaoliu as a major traitor, falsely accusing Li Xiaoliu of murdering our Party cadres, murdering our primary school teachers, attacking our district squad, and having seven lives on his hands, etc. At the time, the Prefectural Committee members did not promptly realize Wang Zhenhai's despicable intentions. It was not until Wang Zhenhai secretly instructed the Wuji County Committee to notify the County Public Security Bureau to arrest Li Xiaoliu that Comrade Liao Dinglin, Commander of the Ding County Military Sub-district, discovered it and reported the situation to the Prefectural Committee, and the Prefectural Committee became aware of it.

    It turned out that Wang Zhenhai's plot to frame Li Xiaoliu was long premeditated and a planned and organized action. In 1948, Wang Zhenhai personally went to the Wuji County Committee and instructed them to expel Li Xiaoliu from the Party and remove him from his position as village head. The County Committee did not carry out the instructions because it did not have any materials on Li. During the Party rectification in 1948, Jin Yangxian, Deputy Minister of the Prefectural Committee's Organization Department, went to Wuji County to inspect the Party rectification work, and Wang Zhenhai again told Jin Yangxian the long-fabricated false information, asking him to immediately deal with the Li Xiaoliu issue. When Zhang Jishi, Minister of the Organization Department of the Wuji County Committee, came to the Prefectural Committee for a meeting, Wang Zhenhai again instructed him to expel Li Xiaoliu from the Party and arrest him. Later, Wang Zhenhai's wife, Zhang Ying, personally, as a "Communist Party member," carried a letter of accusation written by the landlord and went to the Wuji County Public Security Bureau to find the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Zhichao, falsely claiming that Li Xiaoliu was a traitor and accusing Li Xiaoliu of killing her brother Li Shiyan... etc. (The County Public Security Bureau has Zhang's indictment on file). Based on Wang Zhenhai's previous instructions and his wife's accusations, the Wuji County Committee finally expelled Li Xiaoliu from the Party in August 1948, removed him from his position as village head in 1949, and the Wuji County Public Security Bureau issued the first order to arrest Li Xiaoliu in March 1950. Because Comrade Li Xiaoliu had prestige among the masses in his village, the masses immediately helped him escape. After Li Xiaoliu fled, he first found Comrade Niu Zhen of the Hebei Provincial Military Region and Comrade Liu Hongtao, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Committee, and then found Comrade Liao Dinglin mentioned above. Comrades Niu, Liu, and Liao all testified to the Prefectural Committee that Li Xiaoliu was an old Party member before "July 7th" and had made great contributions to revolutionary work and should not be arrested. However, Wang Zhenhai ignored them all.

    In order to thoroughly understand the truth, the Prefectural Committee instructed the Prefectural Committee Organization Department to send a letter to the Wuji County Committee, questioning why Li Xiaoliu was expelled from the Party, why he was removed from his position as village head, and why he was arrested. The content of the Wuji County Committee's reply was roughly the same as Wang Zhenhai's instructions to them. The letter stated that this was done according to the instructions of Comrade Wang Zhenhai of the Prefectural Committee, and for specific details, please ask Comrade Wang Zhenhai (this letter is kept in the Prefectural Committee Organization Department)! At that time, I also talked to Wang Zhenhai, pointing out that this was an egregious act of violating laws and discipline and should be stopped immediately and a self-criticism made. However, Wang still insisted that Li Xiaoliu was a counter-revolutionary and attempted to continue the error to the end. Seeing that persuasion was ineffective, I reported the situation to the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC. The Provincial Committee Organization Department asked Wang Zhenhai to reflect on this matter. Upon receiving the letter from the Provincial Committee, Wang Zhenhai was dissatisfied with me and scolded me twice. At that time, the majority of the members of the Ding County Prefectural Committee did not criticize or stop this act of losing their stand and violating Party discipline, and they shielded Wang Zhenhai, causing Wang Zhenhai's mistakes to grow.

    After the national campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched, Wang Zhenhai took the opportunity to secretly go to Wuji County to instruct the County Committee to arrest and kill Li Xiaoliu. The Wuji County Committee knew that this was wrong, but under Wang Zhenhai's coercion, they carried out Wang Zhenhai's extremely erroneous instructions on July 2, 1951, arresting Comrade Li Xiaoliu, adding handcuffs and shackles, and imprisoning him for a year. [Note]

    Originally, Wang Zhenhai instructed the Wuji County Committee to notify the County People's Government to sentence Li Xiaoliu to death immediately, attempting to kill Li Xiaoliu to silence him. After Wang Zhenhai's instructions were issued, he heard inquiries from all sides about this incident and temporarily changed it to a suspended sentence. He also personally secretly reported to the Hebei Provincial Committee, deceiving the Provincial Committee into approving it.

    Although Wang Zhenhai's malicious methods deceived people in the short term, the members of the Prefectural Committee soon discovered it. At that time, I also reported the true situation of Li Xiaoliu to the Provincial Committee, and the Provincial Committee sent Comrade Guo Fengchi of the Provincial Committee Discipline Inspection Committee to Wuji County Dongniu Village, Gaocheng, Zhengding, Shijiazhuang and other relevant parties to conduct an investigation in coordination with Comrade Jia Bingxiang of the Prefectural Committee Organization Department.

    When Comrade Guo Fengchi was conducting the investigation, Wang Zhenhai provided false information to Guo in order to cover up his crimes. However, Wang Zhenhai could not completely hide the truth from everyone. Later, when Comrades Guo Fengchi and Jia Bingxiang went to Wuji County to investigate and questioned the Wuji County Committee why they had dealt with Li Xiaoliu, Zhang Jishi, Minister of the Organization Department of the Wuji County Committee, and Zhang Zhichao, Director of the Public Security Bureau, said: We did not have any materials on hand when dealing with Li Xiaoliu. We sentenced him to death based on Wang Zhenhai's instructions and opinions. We had concerns in the past and dared not say so. Now let's confess to you. If we are wrong, we are wrong. We should reflect on ourselves and accept punishment!

    After the matter was clarified, Wang Zhenhai still insisted on his error, fabricating out of thin air that two cadres could testify that Li Xiaoliu had committed murder. After investigation by the Prefectural Committee Organization Department, it was proved to be completely fabricated. At this point, Wang Zhenhai still refused to admit his mistake in the face of many facts, saying that Li Xiaoliu was a counter-revolutionary.

    It should also be pointed out that members of the Ding County Prefectural Committee such as Lin Dayu, Shen Xiangshan, Li Tai, Li Guoqing, and Zhao Shuguang, in the face of such a serious event that lost their stand and harmed the interests of the Party, they did not adhere to the Party's principles and wage a firm struggle against Wang Zhenhai's erroneous behavior. On the contrary, they used vulgar personal feelings, localism (Zhao and Wang are fellow villagers), and sectarianism and other non-Party attitudes to forcibly defend Wang Zhenhai. They mistakenly organized small groups to attack individual comrades who adhered to principles and persisted in the struggle. For example, after I reported Wang Zhenhai's situation to the Provincial Committee, Lin Dayu, a member of the Prefectural Committee and Secretary-General of the Prefectural Committee, and others convened a small Party group meeting to criticize me, questioning me, "Do you want to usurp Wang Zhenhai's 'position' and become the full secretary..." When the Provincial Committee sent a letter to Wang Zhenhai asking him to reflect, Lin Dayu and others privately made a false report to the Provincial Committee in the name of the Prefectural Committee. Zhao Shuguang and Li Guoqing also gave false testimony for Wang Zhenhai, saying that Comrade Wang Zhenhai did not instruct the killing when he went to Wuji County. Later, the investigation by Comrades Guo Fengchi and Jia Bingxiang proved that Comrades Zhao Shuguang and Li Guoqing were clearly covering up Wang Zhenhai's mistakes.

    I believe that Wang Zhenhai and his landlord father-in-law Li Baixue's act of launching a counterattack against Comrade Li Xiaoliu, who was once the backbone leader of the poor peasant association and a Communist Party member, is completely standing on the side of the landlords. From the content of Wang Zhenhai's several instructions to the Wuji County Committee, from the content of the materials of his wife Zhang Ying's accusation against Li Xiaoliu to the Director of the Wuji County Public Security Bureau, from the content and circumstances of the "crimes" accused by Wang Zhenhai's father-in-law's family to the County People's Government, all this clearly shows this point.

    Wang Zhenhai's efforts to collude with and shield landlords, create conspiracies, and frame Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu are by no means accidental, but a consistent, long-planned conspiracy, especially since he personally went to instruct the Wuji County Committee seven or eight times. This is definitely not due to his leadership's subjectivism and bureaucratism, only listening to the one-sided words of his wife and father-in-law, because many people have proved that Li Xiaoliu is not only a good person but has always worked for the revolution. At the same time, after repeated investigations, the Prefectural Committee has also continuously struggled over this issue. Wang Zhenhai actually used the power of the Party to seek personal revenge, not only losing the proletarian stand, but also being the most conspiratorial and vicious class enemy, and should be subject to the strictest punishment of Party discipline.

    I suggest that the higher-level Party conduct appropriate rectification of the Ding County Prefectural Committee, and those who have consistently echoed and supported Wang Zhenhai, such as Lin Dayu, should also be given appropriate punishment to purify the Party's organization and ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies.

    The details of Wang Zhenhai's egregious behavior that I have exposed are all factual. If there is any falsehood or fabrication, I am willing to be punished by the Party.

                                    Fan Wenxing

    [Note] After Comrade Li Xiaoliu was sentenced to death with the approval of the Provincial Committee, Zhao Shuguang, seeing that the struggle over this issue in the Prefectural Committee had grown, was afraid that this incident would be unfavorable to Wang Zhenhai in the future. Therefore, in the summer of 1951, he personally went to Wuji County to notify the Public Security Bureau to temporarily release Li Xiaoliu. However, the original judgment remained unchanged and was not corrected.

    中共定县地委前任副书记范文兴来信
    揭发地委书记王振海违法乱纪行为
    编者按：中共定县地委前任副书记范文兴同志所揭发的地委书记王振海庇护地主丈人，谋害无极县东牛村支部党员李小六同志的事实，是应该引起我们严重注意的。对于王振海这样违法乱纪的行为，中共河北省委应即严正地加以处理，并将结果在报上公布。
    编辑同志：我是前中共河北省定县地委会的副书记，现已调来北京工作。我在定县地委会工作期间，为着一个重大问题，曾与几个地委委员长期争论至今仍未解决。争论的问题说出来实在骇人听闻。这就是中共定县地委会书记王振海，勾结并包庇地主分子李白雪，阴谋杀害共产党员李小六的严重事件。现向你们提出，并请有关方面迅予解决。
    为什么地委书记王振海竭力勾结地主李白雪陷害共产党员李小六呢？为了便于说明问题，我首先介绍一下李小六同志的情况。
    李小六同志是河北省无极县东牛村人（和地主李白雪同一个村子），他在一九二九年加入中国共产党。早在定县简易师范学校读书期间即领导同学进行革命工作，曾被国民党逮捕入狱达数年之久。一九三一年又同当地革命同志取得联系进行庙会宣传。一九三九年经牛真同志（河北省军区参谋长）介绍在前冀中区第七军分区做情报侦察工作；工作很积极，不幸于一九四二年被日寇捕获，监禁数年，最后又解送到日本数月，日本投降后才释回。回国后，他继续积极参加革命工作。一九四七年由东牛村党员马银虎介绍重新入党，后又参加土地改革工作，担任东牛村村长，党内被选为中共东牛村支部委员会委员，他积极领导本村贫农团向地主进行斗争。
    王振海的岳父李白雪是东牛村的地主。李小六曾领导贫农团斗争了李白雪。当时王振海的爱人张英（系化名），在中共安国县城关区委会任组织委员，竭力庇护她的地主家庭，用假分家和转移财产等卑劣手段，逃避群众斗争，并将王振海也报名在地主家分地（王振海一人分了三份土地，在他的地主丈人家里分了一份，在他的本村分了两份）。在土地改革复查中，张英虽在群众压力下作了检讨，但从此对李小六同志就存有成见，并恐吓李小六说：“你想当一辈子村长吗！？弄不倒你我就不姓李了！”这时，地主李白雪经常到地委机关中来找王振海，王振海对东牛村党组织很不满意，特别是对李小六；并经常对我们地委委员们说：“无极县东牛村党支部不纯，被汉奸封建势力掌握着哩！”他恶毒地捏造事实诬蔑李小六是个大汉奸，诬栽李小六杀害过我们党的干部，杀害过我们的小学教员，攻击过我们的区小队，有七条人命的血债等等。当时地委委员们没有及时发觉王振海的卑劣意图，及至王振海以秘密的方式指示无极县委，通知县公安局逮捕李小六时，才被定县军分区司令员廖鼎林同志发觉，廖鼎林把这个情况报告地委会，地委会才知道了。
    原来王振海陷害李小六的诡计是蓄谋已久的，是有计划有组织的行动。一九四八年王振海曾亲自去无极县委会，指示无极县委开除李小六的党籍，撤销其村长职务。县委因未掌握李的任何材料，也就没有执行。在一九四八年整党期间，地委副组织部长晋仰贤同志赴无极县检查整党工作时，王振海又将久已捏造的虚伪情况告诉晋仰贤，要他立即处理李小六的问题。无极县委组织部长张济世同志到地委开会时，王振海又指示他开除李小六党籍和逮捕李小六。后来王振海的爱人张英又亲自以“共产党员的身份”，携带地主所写的控告信，到无极县公安局找公安局长张志超，诬称李小六是汉奸，并控诉李小六杀死过他哥哥李世岩……等等（县公安局有张的控诉状可查）。无极县委根据王振海的前后指示及其爱人的控诉，卒于一九四八年八月间开除李小六的党籍，一九四九年撤销其村长职务，一九五○年三月间无极县公安局即第一次下令逮捕李小六。由于李小六同志在本村群众中有威信，群众立即把他放跑了。李小六逃走后，先找到河北省军区牛真和省委统一战线工作部部长刘鸿涛二同志，后又找到以上说的廖鼎林同志，牛、刘、廖三同志都先后向地委证明李小六是“七七”前的老党员，曾对革命工作有过大的贡献，不应逮捕他。但王振海均置之不理。
    地委会为彻底了解真相，即责成地委组织部去信责问无极县委，为什么开除李小六的党籍，为什么撤他村长的职务，又为什么逮捕他？无极县委回答内容大体上和王振海给他的指示差不多；信后并说明这是地委王振海同志指示我们这样做的，具体事情请你们问王振海同志吧（此信在地委组织部留存）！当时我又找王振海谈，指出这是违法乱纪的恶劣行为，应该立即停止并作检讨，结果王仍坚称李小六为反革命分子，企图继续错误到底。我看劝阻无效，即将此情况向中共河北省委组织部反映；省委组织部要王振海对这事进行反省，王振海一见省委来信，即对我不满，前后大骂了我两次。当时定县地委的大部分委员们，对这种丧失立场，违反党纪的行为，竟不加批判，也不制止，并包庇王振海，致使王振海的错误日益发展。
    在全国镇压反革命工作布置后，王振海又乘此时机秘密亲身赴无极县指示县委捕杀李小六；无极县委明知不对，但在王振海的威逼下，于一九五一年七月二日执行了王振海个人极错误的指示，将李小六同志逮捕起来，加铐加镣，监禁一年之久。〔注〕
    原来王振海指示无极县委通知县人民政府对李小六判处死刑立即执行的，企图杀死李小六消声灭迹，王振海的指示发出后，听到各方面对这一事件的现询，临时改为缓期执行，又亲自秘密报告河北省委，骗取了省委的批准。
    王振海的恶毒手段，虽然在短时间内瞒过了，但不久地委委员也就发觉了；当时我又把李小六的真实情况反映到省委，省委即派省委纪律检查委员会的郭凤池同志协同地委组织部贾丙祥同志赴无极县东牛村以及藁城、正定、石家庄各有关方面进行调查。
    当郭凤池同志进行调查时，王振海为了掩饰罪过，曾向郭供给假情况。但是，王振海终于不能一手掩尽天下人的耳目，后来郭凤池、贾丙祥二同志去无极县调查，质问无极县委你们为什么处理李小六？无极县委组织部长张济世、公安局长张志超二同志说：处理李小六这一问题，我们没有掌握着任何材料，我们是按王振海的指示和意见判处他的死刑的。过去我们有顾虑不敢这样说，现在我们向你们坦白了吧，错就错了，该反省我们反省，该受处分我们就受处分吧！
    在问题调查清楚后，王振海仍然坚持错误，无中生有地编造某某两个干部可作李小六杀人的见证。后经地委组织部调查，结果证明完全虚构。至此，王振海在许多事实面前还是不承认错误，仍说李小六是反革命分子。
    这里同时要提出的是定县地委委员如林达宇、申向山、李太、李国庆、赵树光等同志，在如此严重丧失立场违害党的利益的事件前面，他们没有坚持党的原则，和王振海的错误行为作坚决的斗争，相反地他们是以庸俗的私人感情、乡里观念（赵和王是老乡）及宗派主义等非党态度为王振海强加辩护。他们错误地组织小的集团，打击个别坚持原则坚持斗争的同志，如我将王振海的情况反映到省委后，地委委员兼地委秘书长林达宇等曾召开党的小组会斗争我，责问我“你是否想篡王振海的‘位’、想当正书记……。”当省委给王振海来信要王反省时，林达宇等曾私自以地委会的名义给省委做了假报告。赵树光、李国庆也替王振海做假证，说王振海同志到无极县去并没有指示杀人情事。后来郭凤池、贾丙祥二同志调查证明赵树光和李国庆同志显然是给王振海的错误作掩护。
    我认为王振海和地主岳父李白雪一道向着曾经是贫农团的领导骨干、共产党员李小六同志打反攻的行为，是完全站在地主立场上。从王振海数次指示无极县委的内容来看，从他的爱人张英向无极县公安局长控诉李小六材料的内容来看，从王振海他岳父家向县人民政府控诉李小六的“罪行”内容及其情形来看，都非常明显地说明了这一点。
    王振海极力勾结和包庇地主、制造阴谋、陷害共产党员李小六决不是偶然的，而是一贯的，长期蓄谋的，特别是他亲自出马指示无极县委七八次之多，这决不是由于他领导上的主观主义和官僚主义只听其爱人和岳父一面之词所致，因为有很多人证明李小六不但是好人，而且始终为革命工作，同时经过了反复的调查，地委会也为此问题又不断地进行了斗争。王振海竟利用党的职权，以公报私仇，不仅丧失了无产阶级立场，而且是最阴谋最毒辣的阶级敌人，应当受到党的纪律的最严格的处分。
    我建议上级党应对定县地委会作适当整顿，并对一贯附和支持王振海的人如林达宇等均应予以适当处分，以纯洁党的组织，保障党的政策正确地贯彻执行。
    我所揭发的王振海恶劣行为各节，均属事实，如有虚伪或捏造之处，甘愿受到党的处分。
                                    范文兴
    〔注〕李小六同志自经省委批准判处死刑后，因赵树光看到地委会中对此问题的斗争发展大了，恐怕此事件将来对王振海不利，因此，即于一九五一年夏亲自赴无极县通知公安局暂时把李小六放出来。但原判决始终保持原样，并未纠正。
