    To summarize and exchange the experiences of various places in North China in studying the history of the Chinese Communist Party in 1952, improve study leadership, and welcome the theoretical study of on-the-job cadres in 1953, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a regional theoretical education work conference in late November 1952. Thirty-one cadres in charge of theoretical education work from various provinces and cities attended the meeting. The meeting lasted ten days.

    The conference first summarized the gains made in the past six months by various localities in studying the history of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's works "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." More than 160,000 cadres in the North China region participated in the study in 1952. The cadres who participated in this study had a relatively systematic understanding of the basic problems of the Chinese revolution and Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology for the Chinese revolution. Because the vast number of cadres realized from their studies that learning Marxist-Leninist theory can improve their awareness and improve their work, their consciousness and enthusiasm for studying theory were very high. Various localities have also made many creations and improvements in teaching organization and teaching methods. Full-time and part-time teachers and study tutors have been widely equipped. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 1,725 teachers (including 251 full-time) and 6,011 tutors (including 99 full-time) in the region. Many places have established more formal theoretical schools for on-the-job cadres. Teaching work also has a more systematic and regular system and procedures.

    The conference focused on the issue of linking theory with practice. The main experiences of various places in North China in implementing the principle of linking theory with practice are as follows: 1. Theoretical study must be subordinate to and serve the current general work tasks, and must theoretically improve the policy and ideological level of cadres in order to achieve the effect of improving current work. The gains from studying the history of the Chinese Communist Party and "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" in the past six months have been great, mainly because attention was paid to linking the study with the work and thinking of cadres during the study process, meeting the needs of the vast number of cadres to "study theory, improve awareness, and improve work." 2. Linking theory with practice should be to understand the spiritual essence of theory, use it to improve thinking, and improve work. Some cadres are eager to use each paragraph or each theoretical principle in the documents they have studied to directly solve all specific problems in their work, which is impossible. Such "connection" is a far-fetched and stiff connection, and cannot truly improve the ideological level of cadres. In addition, some cadres use the theory they have learned to connect with trivial matters that have nothing to do with work or thinking, instead of connecting with important issues in revolutionary movements and policies. Such "connection" is a vulgarized connection, and cannot solve the problem. Some cadres, when talking about the issue of linking theory with practice, asked: "Which is more important, linking with work or linking with thinking?" This statement is also inappropriate. Because this statement separates thought from work. In fact, when linking theory with practice, one must discover ideological problems from actual work, and improve actual work by improving thinking. Experience has shown that only by paying attention to correcting these erroneous understandings at any time during the teaching process can the study achieve the desired effect. 3. In order to implement the principle of linking theory with practice, it is necessary to start from two aspects: on the part of the learners, they must pay attention to correcting their learning attitude, delving into the documents, and delving into the problems in practical work. At the same time, they must also clarify their position, exercise their ideological awareness, and criticize their own erroneous ideas, so that they can truly understand the spiritual essence of the documents and gradually improve their class consciousness and working ability; in terms of learning guidance, they must pay attention to helping everyone solve the problem of how to link with reality, and there should be different focuses and requirements for cadres of different departments and different levels; it is necessary to go deep into typical cases, create learning experiences that link theory with practice, and promote them.

    Regarding the organizational form of on-the-job cadre study, the conference focused on introducing the theoretical schools for on-the-job cadres in Tangshan and Shijiazhuang. These two schools use their spare time in the morning for teaching. Their characteristics are centralized management, unified leadership, and relatively complete plans, teaching procedures, and various systems, which can improve teaching quality and ensure that regular learning is carried out step by step. The conference believes that this form of learning organization can be gradually promoted in places where conditions permit. However, due to different conditions in various places, it is impossible to force the adoption of the same organizational form and leadership methods.

    Finally, the conference studied the learning issues for 1953. In order to cooperate with the national large-scale economic construction, it was determined that all cadres would generally undergo theoretical and policy study related to economic construction in 1953. Senior cadres will study "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Chapters 9 to 12 of the Short Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the basic issues of China's economic construction. The intermediate group is divided into two groups, higher and lower, according to their theoretical level. The higher group will study Chapters 9 to 12 of the Short Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in conjunction with the problems of China's economic construction; the lower group will study the Economic Construction Reader (primary edition of Learning Magazine), or compile a study outline on economic construction issues. Urban working cadres participating in the primary group can study the Economic Construction Reader, and rural working cadres will use the rural mutual aid and cooperation textbook as the basic reader, and add some issues related to economic construction. Some departments and cadres may stipulate their own learning content due to different work requirements, and there is no need to force consistency. However, the leadership focus of the propaganda departments of the Communist Party committees at all levels should be placed on the study of economic construction issues, and special studies by a few departments should be taken care of as much as possible.

    In order to prepare for studying theoretical knowledge of economic construction, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to hold a research class, drawing 40 cadres with higher levels from various provinces and cities to study intensively for two or three months. After they have studied well, they will return to their respective provinces and cities to train middle and primary level teachers. In order to help teachers strengthen theoretical guidance in their studies, the conference suggested that each province and Beijing, Tianjin, and provincial-level cities with conditions establish research offices.

    华北局宣传部召开全区理论教育工作会议
    确定一九五三年所有干部一般都进行有关经济建设的理论和政策学习
    为了总结和交流华北各地一九五二年学习中共党史的经验，改进学习领导，并迎接一九五三年在职干部理论学习，中共中央华北局宣传部在一九五二年十一月下旬召开了全区理论教育工作会议。到会的有各省、市负责理论教育工作的干部三十一人。会议历时十天。
    这次会议首先总结了半年来各地学习中共党史和毛泽东同志的著作“矛盾论”“实践论”的收获。华北全区一九五二年参加学习的干部有十六万多人。参加这次学习的干部，都比较系统地了解了中国革命的基本问题与毛泽东同志对中国革命的指导思想。由于广大干部从学习中体会到学习马克思列宁主义的理论能够提高觉悟、改进工作，因而学习理论的自觉性和学习热情都很高。各地在教学组织与教学方法上也有很多创造与改进。普遍配备了专职和兼职的教员与学习辅导员，据不完全统计，全区目前有教员一千七百二十五人（内专职的二百五十一人），辅导员六千零十一人（内专职的九十九人）。不少地方设立了较正规的在职干部理论学校。教学工作也有了较系统正规的制度与程序。
    会议着重研究了理论联系实际的问题。华北各地在贯彻理论联系实际的学习方针中，主要经验有以下三点：一、理论学习必须服从和服务于当前总的工作任务，必须从理论上提高干部的政策思想水平，以达到改进当前工作的效果。半年来中共党史和“矛盾论”、“实践论”的学习收获很大，主要是由于在学习过程中注意了联系干部的工作和思想，满足了广大干部“学习理论，提高觉悟，改进工作”的要求。二、理论联系实际应是领会理论的精神实质，用以提高思想，改进工作。有些干部急于要求用所学文件中的每一段或每一个理论原则来直接解决工作中的一切具体问题，这是不可能的。这样的“联系”是牵强生硬的联系，并不能真正提高干部的思想水平。另有些干部把所学的理论去联系一些与工作、思想无关的琐事，不是联系革命运动和政策中的重要问题，这样的“联系”是一种庸俗化的联系，也是不能解决问题的。也有些干部在谈到理论联系实际的问题时，提出：“联系工作和联系思想那一个是主要的？”这种提法也是不妥当的。因为这种提法，是把思想和工作割裂开了。实际上在理论联系实际时，必须从实际工作中去发掘思想上的问题，并从提高思想来达到改进实际工作的效果。经验证明：只有在教学过程中随时注意纠正这些错误的认识，才能使学习取得应有的效果。三、为了贯彻理论联系实际的方针，要从两方面着手：在学习者方面，必须注意端正学习态度，深入钻研文件，钻研实际工作中的问题。同时还要明确立场，锻炼自己的思想意识，批判自己的错误思想，这样才能真正领会文件的精神实质，并逐渐提高自己的阶级觉悟和工作能力；在学习指导方面，必须注意帮助大家解决如何联系实际的问题，对不同部门和不同程度的干部应有不同的重点和要求；要深入典型，创造理论联系实际的学习经验，加以推广。
    关于在职干部学习的组织形式问题，会议着重介绍了唐山和石家庄的在职干部理论学校，这两个学校都是利用早上的业余时间进行教学。其特点是管理集中，领导统一，有比较完整的计划、教学程序和各种制度，可以提高教学质量，并保证按步就班地进行正规学习。会议认为这种学习组织形式可以在有条件的地方逐步推行。但由于各地的情况不同，因之不能强求采取一样的组织形式和领导方法。
    最后，会议研究了一九五三年的学习问题。为了配合全国大规模的经济建设，确定所有干部一九五三年一般都进行有关经济建设的理论和政策的学习。高级干部学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”和联共党史简明教程第九章至十二章及中国经济建设的基本问题。中级组按理论水平分编为较高和较低两种小组，较高的小组结合中国经济建设问题学联共党史简明教程第九章至十二章；较低的小组学经济建设读本（学习杂志初级版），或另编经济建设问题学习提纲。参加初级组的城市工作干部可学经济建设读本，农村工作干部以农村互助合作教材为基本读本，另增加有关经济建设的一些问题。有些部门和干部由于工作要求不同，也可自行规定学习内容，不强求一致。但各级中共党委宣传部的领导重点应放在经济建设问题的学习方面，对少数部门的特殊学习尽量予以照顾。
    为了做好学习经济建设理论知识的准备工作，中共中央华北局宣传部已决定举办研究班，抽调各省、市水平较高的干部四十人集中学习两、三个月。他们学好后，再回各省、市训练中、初级教员。为了帮助教员加强学习中的理论指导，会议建议各省和北京、天津二市以及有条件的省辖市建立研究室。（新华社）
