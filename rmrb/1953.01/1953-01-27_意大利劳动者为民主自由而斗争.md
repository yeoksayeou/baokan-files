    Italian Workers Fight for Democratic Freedom
    By Dé Xièfúliā jīn, Soviet Union
    Recently, all sectors of Italian society have been closely watching the struggle in Parliament against the election system reform bill proposed by the Gasperi government. Italian workers have held meetings and strikes, and have sent telegrams to Parliament, advocating the rejection of this "deceptive bill." The Italian people protested against the authorities' conspiracy to restrict their constitutional rights, expressing support and solidarity with the Communist, Socialist, and independent democratic parliamentarians who exposed the authorities' trampling of democratic freedoms.

    What is the content of this deceptive bill? Why is it that only five years after the Republic's Constitution came into effect, the Italian reactionaries are seeking to abolish one of its provisions concerning democratic freedoms?

    The first Republican parliamentary elections in 1948 were conducted using a proportional representation system. The Christian Democratic Party, i.e., the Catholic Democratic Party, gained a majority in the elections. It has used this majority to dominate the country, seeking benefits for U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and dragging Italy into the Atlantic aggressive bloc.

    Five years ago, in December 1947, the last troops of the U.S. occupying forces left Italy. Now, U.S. troops are once again all over the country: the headquarters of the U.S. military are stationed in Verona, Florence, and Naples. Numerous large-scale arsenals, ammunition depots, supply depots, and napalm depots have been built in Livorno and along the Adriatic coast. In Apulia, Pompei, Tuscany, Veneto, and other regions, U.S. officers arbitrarily requisition farmers' land and destroy buildings and crops to build military airfields. According to representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Paris headquarters, this aggressive bloc has built a total of one hundred air bases in Western Europe; as of November 1952, twelve air bases had been built in Italy. Ports such as Naples, Augusta, and Taranto have become anchorages for the U.S. fleet.

    In economic terms, the damage to Italian national independence is even greater. The Italian ruling clique has forced the country to accept a series of enslaving treaties and agreements with the United States. These treaties and agreements give U.S. monopoly capitalists extensive opportunities to control various sectors of the Italian national economy. For example, according to the agreement of September 26, 1951, U.S. capitalists have the right to acquire any enterprise and real estate, can invest without any obstacles, and can transport the loot they obtain out of Italy. U.S. merchants are exempt from taxes and customs duties and receive various other exemptions and privileges. These rights are generally only enjoyed by imperialists in colonies.

    Due to Italy's obligations to the Atlantic Pact and the so-called "Schuman Plan," U.S. monopoly capitalists have effectively controlled Italy's financial, credit system, and the entire economic activity. The head of the U.S. "Mutual Security Agency" mission in Italy, Dayton, and his staff interfere with Italy's national expenditures and production scales, and so on.

    This policy has caused a profound crisis in the Italian economy. Peaceful production is declining. Vittorio, the General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, pointed out in his report at the Third Congress of the General Confederation of Labor at the end of November 1952: in the first six months of 1952 alone, Italy closed 53 textile factories, the shipbuilding industry operated at only 33 percent of capacity, locomotive and carriage manufacturing plants at 13 percent, and machine tool manufacturing plants at 50 percent. The total number of machine tools in the country has decreased by 26 percent since 1938. The number of unemployed people in the country is increasing day by day, and now totals 2,147,000. According to materials from the Central Bureau of Statistics, the cost of living in Italy increased by 15 percent between June 1950 and June 1952. As for the level of per capita demand for major foods (meat, fats, sugar, etc.), Italy ranks last in Europe.

    The ruling Christian Democratic Party's policy of rearming and turning Italy into a U.S. aggression base has aroused the indignation and alarm of the broad masses of Italian workers.

    In the municipal elections of 1951 and 1952, the Italian people convincingly expressed their opposition to the policies of the Christian Democratic Party. Compared with the 1948 parliamentary elections, the party lost four million votes in the municipal elections. This shows that in the upcoming parliamentary elections, the Christian Democratic Party can hardly expect to win a majority of seats.

    The electoral system "reform" is a trick of the Italian reactionaries, the purpose of which is to force the people to let the Gasperi party stay in power for another four years. The content of this reform is as follows: if a party or coalition of parties wins more than 50 percent plus one vote of the total votes in the election, the number of seats it gets in parliament will not be half - 295 seats - but 385 seats. Thus, even a one-vote advantage would have the right to an extra 90 seats as a "bonus"; to obtain so many seats under proportional representation, one would have to get at least 3.8 million votes. The purpose of this conspiracy to abolish the constitutional provision that all citizens have "equal voting rights" is to reduce the number of representatives of the Communist and Socialist parties, the political organizations of the working people, in parliament. Because the Communist and Socialist parties have won 40 percent of the total votes in municipal elections, and even 50 percent in individual provinces.

    According to this new bill, the extremely complex machine for calculating votes guarantees that if the Christian Democrats receive 40 percent of all votes, they can get a simple majority in parliament, and if they alone, or together with their allies, get more than half plus one vote, they can get 65 percent of all seats.

    Relying on its slim parliamentary majority, the Gasperi government has consistently suppressed the demands of the masses, refusing to implement the social and economic reforms stipulated in the Constitution, such as limiting land ownership, nationalizing monopolies, and reforming the tax and loan system. Government agencies are constantly undermining the most basic civil rights stipulated in the Constitution, such as freedom of speech, assembly, demonstration, strike, and other democratic rights.

    However, the ruling clique and reactionary forces have consistently failed to pass their anti-democratic bills in parliament. In fact, their destruction and trampling of democratic freedoms and civil rights is a clear violation of the Constitution. And the Italian working masses, under the leadership of their parties and trade unions, are legally carrying out the struggle for their rights, the struggle to defend the Constitution. In this way, the Constitution has become a stumbling block for the reactionary groups, so the main purpose of the reactionaries now is to eliminate this obstacle by promulgating anti-democratic laws.

    For example, the Gasperi government has long formulated bills on trade unions, bills on prohibiting strikes, inspecting newspapers, intensifying the suppression of peasants seizing landlords' land and workers seizing factories (in order to continue production), and bills restricting many other basic rights of workers. However, the resistance organized by the Communist and Socialist parties throughout the country has greatly influenced the legislature, which has made even the right-wing socialists of the Saragat and Sherba type, who have always supported Gasperi, afraid to openly support these anti-democratic bills.

    The Italian reactionaries want to completely destroy the Constitution, first of all in order to "legalize" the U.S. occupation of Italy, to hand over the Italian army to U.S. generals, and to step up preparations for war, all of which are prohibited by the current Constitution. On the one hand, due to the prohibitions of the Constitution, and on the other hand, due to fear of collapse, Gasperi has never dared to submit the treaties and agreements he signed to please the United States to Parliament for approval, treaties and agreements which would take away Italy's most important rights, such as national independence.

    From this, it can be seen that the current movement in Italy against the reactionary conspiracy of electoral system "reform" goes far beyond the scope of a general election campaign. The broad masses are actively participating in this struggle, holding strikes and demonstrations every day, protesting against this "deceptive law." This shows that Italian workers have realized the threat this bill poses to their freedom and the independence of their country.

    It is impossible not to notice that the Italian bourgeoisie's offensive against the democratic freedoms of the working people is adopting the old method of establishing a fascist dictatorship.

    Although Mussolini came to power in 1922, it was not until 1924 that he obtained a majority for his party in parliament with the help of the "Acerbo Election Law." The Gasperi-Sherba bill is now a replica of the "Acerbo Election Law." Immediately after Mussolini's election conspiracy, emergency laws appeared, democratic parties were declared "illegal," and later even the parliament was dissolved. According to Italian newspapers, the offices of Interior Minister Sherba and the secretary of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, Gonella, have prepared or are preparing such bills.

    The current ruling party's adoption of the methods of the Mussolini clique has even made Gasperi's political allies uneasy. Recently, famous activists and entire local organizations have withdrawn from Saragat's right-wing Socialist Party. Ordinary party members in factories, after learning that their leaders Saragat and Romita were colluding with Gasperi to carry out a conspiracy to undermine the Constitution, angrily tore up their party cards. Some factions of the Republican Party and many activists of the Liberal Party have also expressed protests. The emergence of the threat of a new dictatorship has even aroused dissatisfaction within the Christian Democratic Party. At the party's November congress, more than one-third of the delegates voted against Gasperi's policies.

    Now, unlike in 1922-1924, the Italian reactionaries' actions to trample on democratic freedoms have been met with a powerful counterattack from the masses organized under the efforts of the Communist Party. During these days when debates continue in Parliament, the movement throughout the country to protest this anti-democratic bill is growing stronger. In December, 100,000 farm laborers in the province of Siena went on strike, and tens of thousands of workers in Rome, Reggio, Catania and many other cities also went on strike. This widespread protest movement proves that the political consciousness of the working masses has been raised, and proves their determination to defend their freedom and the independence of their country. It is the Communists who are tirelessly and enthusiastically organizing this movement.

    Togliatti pointed out at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party on November 10: "We should raise the banner of our country's independence and bourgeois democracy and freedom, and show the world that today we are the people who defend this independence and this freedom, we will not allow these banners to be thrown aside, and we will do everything in our power to reunite all the Italian people around these banners."

    Due to the efforts of the Communist Party, the struggle to defend democratic freedoms and national independence has become the focus of attention for the Italian democratic forces. More and more people in Italy realize that active participation in this struggle is the main condition for increasing their happiness and maintaining peace.

    意大利劳动者为民主自由而斗争
    苏联  德·谢夫利亚金
    最近意大利各界密切注意议会中反对加斯贝利政府的选举制改革法案的斗争。意大利劳动者纷纷举行会议和罢工，并且打电报给议会，主张拒绝这个“欺骗的法案”。意大利人民抗议当局阴谋限制他们的宪法权利，表示支持和声援在议会里揭露当局蹂躏民主自由行为的共产党、社会党、独立民主分子议员。
    这个欺骗法案的内容怎样？为什么共和国宪法生效后只不过五年，意大利反动派就要取消其中关于民主自由的一项规定呢？
    一九四八年第一届共和国议会选举是按比例制进行的。天主教党，即天主教民主党，在选举中获得多数，它就利用这个多数独霸全国，为美帝国主义和国内反动派谋取利益，并且把意大利拖入大西洋侵略集团。
    五年以前，一九四七年十二月，美国占领军的最后部队离开了意大利。现在美军又布满全国了：美国军队的司令部驻扎在味罗那、佛罗伦萨和那不勒斯。在里窝那和亚得里亚海沿岸一带建造了许多庞大的兵工厂、军火库、军需库、凝固汽油弹库。在阿浦利亚、波曼尼耶，杜斯坎尼、维尼托以及其他地区，美国军官任意征用农民的土地，任意毁掉建筑物和农作物，来建设军用飞机场。据北大西洋联盟巴黎总部的代表说，这个侵略集团在西欧一共建造了一百个空军基地；到一九五二年十一月为止，在意大利建造了十二个空军基地。那不勒斯、奥古斯塔、大兰多等港变成了美国舰队的停泊处。
    在经济方面，意大利民族独立受到的损害更大。意大利统治集团强迫本国接受了和美国订立的一连串奴役条约和协定。这些条约和协定使美国垄断资本家有广泛的可能去统治意大利国民经济的各部门。例如按照一九五一年九月二十六日的协定，美国资本家有权收购任何企业和地产，可以不受任何阻碍地进行投资，并且把掠夺得来的东西从意大利运出去。美国商人免征赋税和关税，还获得其他各种豁免权和特权。这些权利一般地只有帝国主义者在殖民地才能享受得到。
    由于意大利承担了对大西洋公约和所谓“舒曼计划”的义务，美国垄断资本家就在实际上控制了意大利的财政、信贷系统和整个经济活动。美国“共同安全署”驻意大利使团团长戴东和他的工作人员干涉着意大利的国家开支以及生产规模等等。
    这种政策使意大利经济遭到深刻的危机。和平生产日趋萎缩。意大利总工会总书记维多里奥在一九五二年十一月末总工会第三次代表大会上作报告时指出：仅仅一九五二年前六个月，意大利就关闭了五十三家纺织工厂，造船厂开工率只达百分之三十三，机车和车厢制造厂为百分之十三，母机制造厂为百分之五十。全国的母机数目从一九三八年以来减少了百分之二十六。全国失业人数一天天增加，现在已达二百一十四万七千人。根据中央统计局的材料，意大利的生活费用在一九五○年六月到一九五二年六月这一段期间增加了百分之十五。至于按人口计算主要食品（肉类、脂肪、糖等）需求量的水平，意大利在欧洲居于末位。
    执政的天主教民主党重新武装和变意大利为美国侵略根据地的政策，引起了意大利广大劳动群众的愤慨和惊慌。
    在一九五一年和一九五二年的市政选举中，意大利人民令人信服地表示了他们反对天主教民主党的政策。和一九四八年的议会选举比较，该党在市政选举中丧失了四百万票。这件事表明：在将来的议会选举中，天主教民主党很难指望获得大多数议席。
    选举制“改革”是意大利反动派的一种诡计，其目的在于硬要人民再让加斯贝利党执政四年。这种改革的内容如下：某一党或党派联盟在选举中获得的选票，只要比总票数百分之五十多一票，在议会获得的席位就不是半数——二百九十五席，而是三百八十五席。因此，甚至一票的优势，就有权获得额外九十席的“奖励”；而在比例制下要获得这么多的席位，至少要得到三百八十万票。要取消宪法中关于一切公民有“平等选举权”的规定的这个阴谋，其目的在于减少劳动人民的政治组织共产党和社会党在议会里的代表数目。因为共产党和社会党在市政选举中曾经获得占总票数百分之四十的选票，在个别省份甚至占百分之五十。
    根据这个新法案，十分复杂的计算选票的机器保证天主教民主党人如果获得全部选票百分之四十就可以在议会得到简单多数，如果它单独地或者和它的联盟者共同获得比半数多一票的选票，就可以得到全部议席的百分之六十五。
    加斯贝利政府依靠它的微弱的议会多数，一直到现在始终压制着群众的要求，拒绝实行宪法所规定的社会改革和经济改革，如限制土地所有制，把垄断企业收归国有，改革税收和贷款制度等等。政府机关不断破坏着宪法所规定的最起码的公民权利，如言论、集会、示威游行、罢工自由以及其他民主权利。
    不过统治集团和反动力量始终无法在议会通过他们的反民主的法案。实际上，他们破坏和蹂躏民主自由与公民权利，显然就是破坏宪法。而意大利劳动群众就在自己的党派和工会领导下依法进行着争取自己的权利的斗争，进行着维护宪法的斗争。这样，宪法就成了反动集团的绊脚石，所以反动派现在的主要目的就是要用颁布反民主法的办法来消灭这种障碍。
    例如，加斯贝利政府早已制订了关于工会法案，关于禁止罢工、检查报纸、加强镇压农民夺取地主土地和工人夺取工厂（为了继续进行生产）的法案以及限制劳动者其他许多基本权利的法案。但是共产党和社会党在全国组织的反抗，对立法机关影响很大，这使得一贯支持加斯贝利和谢尔巴的右翼社会党人之流，也不敢公开支持这些反民主的法案了。
    意大利反动派要彻底破坏宪法，首先是为了要使美国占领意大利这件事“合法化”，要把意大利军队交给美国将领指挥，要加紧准备战争，而这些都是受到现在的宪法禁止的。一方面由于宪法的禁止，一方面由于害怕垮台，加斯贝利始终没敢把他为讨好美国而签订的条约和协定交给议会批准，这些条约和协定要把意大利的像国家独立这样最重要的权利夺去。
    由此看来，现在在意大利进行的反对反动派选举制“改革”阴谋的运动，就远远超出了一般竞选斗争的范畴。广大群众积极参加这个斗争，每天不断举行罢工和示威，抗议这个“欺骗法”。这就说明了意大利劳动者已经认识到这个法案对他们的自由和他们祖国的独立有着怎样的威胁。
    不能不注意的是：意大利资产阶级进攻劳动人民的民主自由，是采用建立法西斯独裁的老办法的。
    虽然墨索里尼一九二二年就执了政，可是一直到一九二四年藉助于“阿切波选举法”才给他的党在议会取得了多数。现在加斯贝利—谢尔巴的法案就是“阿切波选举法”的副本。紧接着墨索里尼的选举阴谋，就出现了紧急法，就宣布民主党派为“非法”，后来索性连议会也解散了。据意大利报纸报道，内政部长谢尔巴和执政的天主教党书记龚涅尔的办公室已经准备好了或者正在制订着这种法案。
    现在的执政党采用墨索里尼集团的办法，甚至使加斯贝利的政治同盟者也忐忑不安了。最近有名的活动家和整个整个地方组织退出了萨拉盖特的右翼社会党。该党在工厂里的普通党员知道其领袖萨拉盖特和罗米塔跟加斯贝利勾结起来进行破坏宪法的阴谋以后，就愤慨地撕毁了党证。共和党的一些派别和自由党的许多活动家也表示抗议。新独裁威胁的出现甚至在天主教民主党内部也引起了不满。在该党十一月的代表大会上，三分之一以上代表投票反对加斯贝利的政策。
    现在和一九二二年—一九二四年不同了，意大利反动派蹂躏民主自由的行动，已遭到了在共产党的努力下组织起来的群众的有力的反击。在议会继续进行辩论的这些日子里，全国抗议这个反民主法案的运动越来越壮大了。十二月份西埃那省有十万雇农罢工，罗马、勒佐、喀大尼亚及其他许多城市成千上万的工人也罢了工。这种广泛的抗议运动证明劳动群众的政治觉悟已经提高，证明他们决心捍卫自己的自由和国家的独立。不倦地、热心地组织这个运动的，是共产党人。
    陶里亚蒂十一月十日在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上指出：“我们应该举起我国的独立和资产阶级民主、自由的旗帜，向世人表明：今天我们是保卫这种独立和这种自由的人，我们不容许把这些旗帜抛在一边，并且要竭尽我们的一切力量，把全体意大利人民再度团结在这些旗帜的周围。”
    由于共产党的努力，维护民主自由和国家独立的斗争成了意大利民主力量注意的中心问题。意大利越来越多的人认识到：积极参加这个斗争，是增进他们的幸福和维护和平的主要条件。
