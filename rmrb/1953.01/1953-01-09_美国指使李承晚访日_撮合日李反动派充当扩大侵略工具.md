Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: Tokyo Dispatch: Under the direction of Clark, the commander of the US invading forces in Korea, the South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee flew to Tokyo on the 5th for a "visit" and left Japan on the 7th to return to South Korea. During his stay in Tokyo, Syngman Rhee held secret talks with Clark, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida, and Dong Xian Guang, the "ambassador" to Japan of the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan. Many sources indicate that the purpose of Clark's instigation of Syngman Rhee's "visit" to Japan was to bring together the US's two puppets in the Far East, Syngman Rhee and Yoshida, as tools for the US to expand its war of aggression, in order to promote the US's conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians."

Before Syngman Rhee's arrival in Japan, an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st stated that Syngman Rhee "intends to negotiate the issue of Japanese troops participating in the Korean War" during his visit to Japan. Agence France-Presse reported on the day Syngman Rhee arrived in Tokyo that Syngman Rhee was in Tokyo to discuss the "future of establishing a Pacific Collective Defense Treaty." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 6th, after Syngman Rhee's meeting with Yoshida, the main issue they discussed was "establishing a collective security system." Syngman Rhee suggested during the meeting that Japan "undertake joint responsibility for defending against communism." The "Mainichi Shimbun" reported that Syngman Rhee and Yoshida "both agreed to cooperate in fighting communism." An Agence France-Presse dispatch also stated that Syngman Rhee and Yoshida had "stipulated some measures" in accordance with the "joint defense plan" drafted by Washington to establish a "three-nation alliance of Japan, Korea, and Nationalist China," and that "this system will be parallel to the three-nation system of the US, Australia, and New Zealand and will eventually be merged into the Pacific Pact." However, these conspiracies are not proceeding smoothly, facing the strong opposition of the Korean people to the revival of Japanese militarism, coupled with the conflicting interests of the Japanese and Rhee reactionaries themselves, Yoshida and Syngman Rhee's "cooperation" is obviously facing great difficulties. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 7th already admitted that "the half-century of simmering differences between these two countries still exist."

Another conspiracy of Syngman Rhee's visit to Japan is to force the 600,000 to 700,000 Korean residents in Japan to join the Rhee puppet army. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 1st, Syngman Rhee will request "General Clark to mobilize Koreans living in Japan to join the South Korean army" during his visit to Japan. In this regard, the Yoshida government had already made preparations according to the instructions of the US master. In October 1952, the Yoshida government attempted to force a large number of Korean residents to be handed over to Syngman Rhee as cannon fodder under the pretext of renewing foreign resident registration cards.

The conspiracy of Syngman Rhee and Yoshida has aroused strong protests from Korean residents in Japan. The Democratic United Front of Korean Residents in Japan sent more than 100 representatives on the 6th to protest to the US authorities and the Yoshida government. The protest letter expressed resolute opposition to the secret talks between Syngman Rhee and Yoshida, and declared that it would not be bound by any agreement that would force the repatriation and conscription of Korean residents in Japan. Korean residents in Tokyo also held rallies and demonstrations to protest against the US's conspiracy to persecute Korean residents by directing its lackeys Syngman Rhee and Yoshida.

### 美国指使李承晚访日  撮合日李反动派充当扩大侵略工具

    美国指使李承晚访日
    撮合日李反动派充当扩大侵略工具
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：在侵朝美军总司令克拉克的导演下，南朝鲜傀儡总统李承晚在五日飞抵东京“访问”，七日离日本返回南朝鲜。李承晚在逗留东京期间曾与克拉克、日本首相吉田和台湾国民党残匪驻日“大使”董显光等人举行密谈。许多消息表明：克拉克这次指使李承晚“访问”日本的目的，在于撮合美国在远东的一对傀儡李承晚和吉田，作为美国扩大侵略战争的工具，以便推行美国的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。
    在李承晚到日本以前，合众社东京一日消息就说：李承晚到日本时“打算就日本军队参加朝鲜战争的问题进行谈判”。法新社在李承晚到达东京的那天报道说：李承晚到东京要商谈“建立太平洋集体防御公约的前途”问题。李承晚与吉田会谈之后，据法新社六日消息说，他们谈的主要问题是
    “建立集体安全系统”，李承晚在会谈中曾建议日本“对防御共产党方面负起共同的责任”。“每日新闻”报道：李承晚与吉田“都同意共同合作对共产主义作战”。法新社的消息又说：李承晚和吉田已按照华盛顿所草拟的“联防计划”“规定了一些措施”，以建立“日本、朝鲜和国民党中国三国同盟”，“这个系统将和美澳新的三国系统平行，并且最后合并到太平洋公约中去”。但是，这些阴谋进行得并不顺利，面临着朝鲜人民强烈反对日本军国主义复活的情绪，加上日、李反动派本身的利益矛盾，吉田和李承晚的“合作”显然还存在着很大的困难。美联社东京七日电就已承认：“这两个国家间半世纪以来沸腾着的分歧仍旧存在着”。
    李承晚到日本的另一个阴谋是要强迫在日本的六七十万朝鲜侨民参加李伪军。据合众社一日消息说：李承晚访日时将请求“克拉克将军动员住在日本的朝鲜人参加南朝鲜军”。在这一方面，吉田政府早已根据美国主子的指示作了准备，吉田政府在
    一九五二年十月曾假借更换外国侨民登记证的名义企图强迫将大批朝鲜侨民交给李承晚去当炮灰。
    李承晚和吉田这种阴谋已引起了在日本的朝鲜侨民的强烈抗议。旅日朝鲜侨民民主统一战线在六日派出一百多个代表向美国当局和吉田政府提出抗议。抗议书对李承晚和吉田的秘密谈判表示坚决反对，并声明决不受任何规定强迫遣返和征募旅日朝鲜侨民的协定的约束。东京的朝鲜侨民并纷纷集会示威，对美国指使它的走狗李承晚和吉田迫害朝鲜侨民的阴谋表示抗议。
