    East China Construction Engineering Bureau Design Company Establishes Professional Responsibility System
    East China Machinery Industry Bureau Transfers Cadres to Establish Design Institutions
    [This newspaper dispatch] To meet the needs of huge design tasks, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau Design Company has initially adjusted its organization, established a professional responsibility system, and is actively training design personnel to enhance its design strength.
    In the early stage of its establishment last year, the design efficiency of the Design Company was lower than that of the Northeast region. Unclear division of labor and lack of individual responsibility in design work were among the main reasons. In order to solve this problem, the company established a responsibility system. The company's original design force was divided into three departments according to the work process: architecture, civil engineering structure, and mechanical and electrical equipment, with several groups under each department. Every engineering design, even a simple toilet design, had to go through these three departments. Therefore, in the design work, there was a phenomenon of multiple handovers, mutual constraints, and waste of effort. Because each group had no fixed design object, they would design workshops one day and schools the next, which affected the improvement of design technology. Also, due to the imbalance of strength in each department, disconnections often occurred, and when problems arose, they were shirked to each other, and no one took responsibility. In November of last year, in order to overcome this shortcoming, the company leadership absorbed advanced experience from the Northeast and established a professional responsibility system. According to the design object, design offices for factories, culture and education, medicine and health, and residence were established respectively, and the design objects of each office were determined and responsible for respectively. For example, the Culture and Education Design Office specializes in the design of schools, cultural centers, auditoriums, theaters and other cultural and educational aspects. In this way, the phenomenon of unclear division of labor and lack of individual responsibility in the past has been overcome, and work efficiency has gradually improved.
    The company also paid attention to solving the problem of too much wasted work in design work. In the past, there were many phenomena of wasted work in design. According to the company's statistics, most of the 214 preliminary design documents completed in the past six months have undergone one or two rework revisions. Among them, 69 were designed by the company because the basic construction unit only started from subjective wishes and commissioned the company to design before the basic construction plan was approved by the higher authorities. Later, the design was completed, but the plan was not approved, and the design drawings were all scrapped. On the other hand, because the company is an enterprise unit, it can only design according to the requirements of the owner—the basic construction unit—and failed to assume the responsibility of design supervision according to the country's entire construction plan, resulting in one-third of the design force being wasted in vain in the past six months. In November of last year, the company adjusted its organization and set up a planning office to review according to the following four conditions before deciding whether to contract the design task entrusted by the unit. These four conditions are: the basic construction unit must have a planned task book approved by the higher authorities, a certificate of property rights, a guarantee of reliable source of funds, and the ability to provide the design data required by the company. If the above conditions are not met, the design will not be carried out. This avoids the continued waste of design power. For example, in November and December of last year, the company received 100 design commissions from various units. After review, 40 of them were returned because they did not meet the conditions.
    At the same time, the design company is also taking various measures to enhance the design force. In addition to successively transferring nearly 100 technical personnel who were originally in non-technical positions in various agencies and organizations, in early December of last year, it also organized more than 120 private architects in Shanghai to study. Recently, more than 40 private architectural technicians have participated in the work of state-owned design companies. In addition, the primary designer training class will also be opened at the end of this month to train a large number of primary staff who can be engaged in tracing, drawing, surveying, and exploration to enhance the design force.
    Furthermore: The East China Machinery Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central Government, in order to strengthen the design force of basic construction and strictly separate design from construction, has decided to transfer 600 engineering and technical personnel from the Bureau headquarters and its affiliated factories who are familiar with production conditions and have a certain technical foundation to form the East China Machinery Design Office, which is specifically responsible for factory design work. By the end of last year, the Bureau had concentrated more than 200 engineering and technical personnel.
    In order to further unify understanding and specifically study the organizational system and working methods, the Bureau convened a forum of engineers from the Bureau headquarters and various factories on the 22nd of last month. Vice Minister Wang Daohan of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central Government and Director Qian Min of the East China Office of the Ministry gave detailed instructions, emphasizing the following points: 1. In the current situation where cadres are lacking, in order to ensure the completion of the basic construction task in 1953, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research and meticulous division of labor on the organizational system. 2. Strictly implement the responsibility system: the planned task book and original design data for each basic construction should be the responsibility of the Bureau and the factory; the actual construction should be the responsibility of the construction and installation organizations; all factory design and construction detailed drawings and necessary start-up guidance should be the responsibility of the Design Office. 3. Correct design attitude: first of all, special attention should be paid to the collection and selection of original data, and the design should consider how to maximize the use of national resources and property, and adopt Soviet or other advanced quotas as much as possible, and pay close attention to working conditions. Through this forum, the engineers generally improved their work confidence and sense of responsibility.

### 华东建筑工程局设计公司建立专业专责制  华东机械工业管理局抽调干部建立设计机构

    华东建筑工程局设计公司建立专业专责制
    华东机械工业管理局抽调干部建立设计机构
    【本报讯】华东建筑工程局设计公司为适应巨大设计任务的需要，已初步调整机构，建立专业专责制，并积极训练设计人员，增强设计力量。
    设计公司在去年成立初期，设计效率较东北地区为低。设计工作中分工不明、无人负责是主要原因之一。该公司为了解决这个问题，建立了专责制。该公司原来的设计力量是按照工作程序分成建筑、土木结构、机电设备等三部门，下设若干小组。每一件工程设计，即使是一个简单的厕所设计，也必须经过这三部门。因此，在设计工作上就产生了转手多，互相牵制，浪费力量的现象。每个小组由于无一定的设计对象，今天设计工房，明天又设计学校，因而影响设计技术的提高。又由于各部门力量不平衡，常常发生脱节现象，出了毛病则互相推诿，无人负责。去年十一月，公司领导上为了克服这个缺点，吸收东北先进经验，建立专业专责制，根据设计对象分别成立工厂、文教、医药卫生、居住等设计室，并确定各室的设计对象，分别负责。如文教设计室专门负责学校、文化馆、大礼堂、戏院等文教方面的设计。这样，就克服了过去分工不明、无人负责的现象，工作效率逐渐提高。
    该公司还注意解决设计工作中的废工太多的问题。过去，设计中的废工现象很多。据该公司统计，半年来完成的二百十四件的初步设计文件中，大部分都经过一、两次返工修改。其中有六十九件，因为基本建设单位只从主观愿望出发，在基本建设计划未经上级批准以前就委托公司设计，后来设计完成，而计划却未得批准，结果设计图样全部作废。另一方面也由于公司是个企业单位，只能按照业主——基本建设单位的要求设计，未能根据国家整个建设计划，负起设计监督责任，以致半年来白白浪费了三分之一的设计力量。去年十一月，该公司调整机构，专门设立一个计划室，根据下列四个条件进行审查以后，再决定是否承包委托单位的设计任务。这四个条件是：基本建设单位必须具备经过上级批准的计划任务书，具有地产权的证件，保证可靠的经费来源，能供给公司要求的设计资料。如果不具备上述条件，就不予设计。这就避免了设计力量的继续浪费。如在去年十一、十二两个月中，公司接到各单位委托的一百件设计，经审查结果，有四十件因不符合条件而退回。
    同时，设计公司还正在采取各种方法增强设计力量，除陆续抽调近百名原在各机关、团体非技术岗位上的技术人员外，去年十二月初，又组织上海市私营建筑师一百二十多人进行学习。最近，已有四十多个私营建筑技师参加国营设计公司工作。此外，初级设计人员训练班亦将在本月底开办，训练大批能担任描图、绘图、测量、钻探等工作的初级工作人员，以增强设计力量。
    又讯：中央第一机械工业部华东机械工业管理局为了加强基本建设的设计力量，并使设计与施工严格分开，决定从局本部及所属各厂调集熟悉生产情况、在技术上有一定基础的工程技术人员六百人，组成华东机械设计处，专门负责工厂设计工作。到去年底为止，该局已集中了二百多工程技术人员。
    为了进一步统一认识，并具体地研究组织制度和工作方法，该局又于上月二十二日召集局本部及各厂有关工程师进行座谈，由中央第一机械工业部汪道涵副部长及该部华东办事处钱敏主任作了详细的指示，着重说明以下几点：一、在目前干部感到缺乏的情况下，为了保证完成一九五三年基本建设任务，必须在组织制度上深入研究、细致分工。二、厉行责任制：各项基本建设的计划任务书及设计原始资料，应由局和厂负责；实际施工由建筑和安装机构负责；全部工厂设计施工详图以及必要时的开工指导，统由设计处负责。三、端正设计态度：首先应特别重视原始资料的搜集与选择，设计中应考虑如何使国家资源和财产得到最大限度的利用，并尽可能采用苏联或其他先进定额，密切注意劳动条件。通过这一座谈，各工程师普遍提高了工作信心和责任感。
