    The Idea of Economic Accounting Must Be Established in Design Work
    Zhu Guoping, Manager of the Civil Construction Design Company of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government
    How to implement the idea of economic accounting in capital construction, so as to save the state's investment as much as possible and maximize the effectiveness of the state's investment, is an important responsibility of comrades engaged in capital construction work. At present, the most important economic accounting in capital construction is in the design aspect. If the design is correct, it can not only reduce construction costs but also reduce future production costs. From our work over the past three years, we have deeply realized the significant role of design work in the overall economic accounting of capital construction.
    In 1952, due to our implementation of new structural design standards, the design of employee dormitories saved an average of at least 100,000 yuan per square meter compared to using the old standards; calculated on the basis of constructing one million square meters, this could save over 100 billion yuan. The employee dormitories of the Harbin Flax Factory, which were built with very little investment into very beautiful buildings, were mainly due to the adoption of the new Soviet design standards. We used these practical examples to educate the design personnel, so that everyone realized the important role of adopting new design standards in saving state investment. As a result, not only were the new standards successfully implemented in all of the designs in 1952, but also some of the designs completed in 1951 were revised. For example, the Industry Department's children's school saved 600 million yuan after being revised according to the new standards, compared to the original design.
    In the past, the design of building foundations was based on the subjective assumptions of the design personnel. They often underestimated the soil bearing capacity and unnecessarily enlarged the foundations, burying valuable state assets underground. In 1952, we determined the soil bearing capacity and the size and depth of the foundations based on scientific soil analysis, overcoming the waste in foundation engineering design. For example, in the design of the Tiexi Workers' Village in Shenyang, according to the past habits of Shenyang, the soil bearing capacity was generally calculated as eight to ten tons; however, after soil analysis, the soil bearing capacity in most areas was above twenty tons. The design made based on this calculation saved half of the materials and labor compared to the old method. In another dormitory, the original design foundation was 2.3 meters deep. After drilling, it was found that the underground was a slightly weathered rock formation, so the foundation was changed to 50 centimeters, saving three-quarters of the materials and labor compared to the original design. Now these projects have been completed without any problems.
    In the past, the design of heating was also mostly based on the assumptions of the design personnel, overestimating the heat consumption and unnecessarily increasing the pipe diameter and the number of radiators. For example, the employee dormitories we designed in 1951 and 1950, due to the excessively large heating equipment, caused headaches and dizziness when the heating was on, and the employees had to open the windows to sleep; after the heating was turned off, they would catch colds; this wasted resources and was not hygienic. This year, we learned the Soviet heating calculation method, which can save 10 million yuan on heating engineering for every 1,000 square meters of building. If this calculation method is universally implemented in the country's large-scale capital construction, the amount saved will be very large.
    However, due to our past lack of the idea of implementing economic accounting in design work, we blindly carried out designs, which caused great losses to the country. For example, the adobe dormitories we designed in 1951 were temporary buildings, and we should have strived to save costs; however, we did not pay attention. We should have used a relatively simple A-frame, but instead designed a very complex mortise-and-tenon frame, which used twice as much wood as the A-frame. The walls were uniformly plastered with cement and then lime. The roofs were uniformly covered with cement tiles. In short, the various materials were extremely disproportionate to the nature of the buildings. According to regulations, this type of dormitory should cost 500,000 yuan per square meter, but after construction, many units actually spent 800,000 yuan. In addition, in terms of material specifications, we did not study the wood production situation and blindly stipulated that small round wood should be used uniformly. In order to carry out construction according to the design, many units had to cut down young trees. This design not only caused waste in construction but also damaged the country's afforestation efforts.
    There were many similar phenomena in the design of factory buildings. For example, the factory building of a medium-sized factory under the Electrical Industry Administration had two types of cranes, 2.5 tons and 5 tons. The crane columns and foundations should have been designed according to different weights; however, the design personnel, in order to save trouble, designed them uniformly according to 5 tons, wasting twice the materials and labor. The factory's research room was an ordinary two-story building, and it would have been perfectly fine to use a brick structure; however, the design personnel adopted a reinforced concrete frame, wasting more than 600 million yuan and prolonging the construction period. The auxiliary buildings of the factory should have been placed outside the factory building, with doors connecting them, in order to save the usable area inside the factory building; however, the design personnel adopted the extremely uneconomical method of large rooms enclosing small rooms, placing some small buildings inside the large factory building that was built at a high price. Moreover, because the auxiliary buildings were inside the factory building, steel roof trusses were uniformly used for fire prevention purposes. Another example is a new factory we designed in Harbin in 1951. In addition to calculating all the floors and columns according to the old method, we also added 8% of steel reinforcement without any principle. When designing doors and windows, we did not pay attention to the specifications of glass production, and had to cut large pieces of glass during installation, causing great waste. We have also seen this phenomenon in the designs of other units. For example, we once saw a Soviet expert reviewing the design of an ordinary warehouse. When he examined that the walls of this warehouse were more than three bricks thick, he asked: "What is this warehouse used to store?" The designer said, "It is used to store iron pipes." The expert said, "Are the iron pipes afraid of freezing?" The designer said, "They are not afraid of freezing." The expert said: "Since the iron pipes are not afraid of freezing, this warehouse design has no other meaning than waste." All these examples show how much loss to the country can be caused if design workers do not have the idea of economic accounting.
    How to strengthen economic accounting in design work? I think the main thing is to improve the ideological awareness of our design personnel. Design personnel should clearly realize: The state's requirements for design work are not only to build houses and factories, but also require our technology to be advanced and economical in use. Some people have the idea of being afraid of "getting involved" and being responsible, thinking that as long as there are no problems, wasting some materials and labor doesn't matter. Some people think that if the design is wrong, it can be revised again. They do not realize how much the mid-term modification of the design affects the construction. The employee dormitories designed in 1952 had problems with the cavity walls, and the design was modified in the middle of the process. As a result, dozens of buildings in a construction site in Harbin, which had already been built to the first floor, had to be demolished and rebuilt, making the labor of several thousand people for dozens of days come to naught. At present, our country is about to start large-scale economic construction. The state requires us to design the most advanced and reasonable factories and houses with the most economical investment. Therefore, implementing the idea of economic accounting in design work, so as to maximize the effectiveness of the state's investment, should be a glorious and serious task for our design personnel.

    必须确立设计工作中的经济核算思想
    东北人民政府工业部土木建筑设计公司经理  朱国平
    如何在基本建设中贯彻经济核算思想，以求得尽量节省国家的投资和使国家的投资发挥最大的效能，乃是从事基本建设工作同志们的一项重要责任。目前基本建设当中最重要的经济核算是在设计方面，如果设计得正确，不但可以降低建筑成本，而且可以使以后的生产成本降低。从三年来的工作中，我们深深体会到了设计工作在整个基本建设经济核算中的重大作用。
    一九五二年，由于我们推行了新的结构设计标准，职工宿舍的设计比使用旧标准平均每平方公尺至少节省十万元；以修建一百万平方公尺计算，可节省一千亿元以上。哈尔滨亚麻厂的职工宿舍，以很少的投资修起了很漂亮的大楼，主要是采用了苏联新设计标准的缘故。我们用这种实际例子向设计人员进行教育，使大家都认识了采用新设计标准对节省国家投资的重要作用以后，不但在一九五二年的设计当中顺利地全部推行了新标准，而且对一九五一年已完成的设计也进行了部分的修改。譬如工业部子弟学校按照新标准修改以后，较原设计节省了六亿元。
    对建筑物基础的设计，过去都是凭设计人员的主观臆断。他们往往过低地估计了地耐力，无原则地把基础加大，使国家的宝贵财产无必要地埋在地下。一九五二年我们根据科学的土壤分析来确定地耐力和基础的大小与深度，克服了基础工程设计上的浪费。譬如沈阳市铁西工人村的设计，按照沈阳市过去的习惯，地耐力一般是算做八吨到十吨；但是经过土壤分析，大部地区的地耐力都在二十吨以上。根据这样计算做出的设计，就比旧办法节省一半材料和人工。另外一处宿舍，原设计基础为两公尺三，经过钻探以后，知道了地下是风化得不厉害的岩盘，于是便把基础改为五十公分；比原设计节省了四分之三的材料和人工。现在这些工程都已完工，没有发生任何问题。
    对取暖的设计，过去也是多凭设计人员的臆断，过高地估计了热量的消耗，无原则地加大管径和增加暖气片。譬如我们在一九五一年和一九五○年设计的职工宿舍，由于暖气设备太大，暖气来了，头疼眼花，职工们不得不开窗睡觉；暖气停后，便弄得伤风感冒；既浪费了资财，又不合乎卫生要求。今年我们学习了苏联的采暖计算法，每一千平方公尺的建筑，在暖气工程上可以节省一千万元。在国家大规模的基本建设中，如果普遍推行这种计算方法，节省的数目将是很大的。
    但是，由于过去我们缺乏在设计工作中贯彻经济核算的思想，盲目地进行设计，也曾给国家造成了很大的损失。譬如我们一九五一年设计的土坯宿舍，是一种临时性的建筑物，应该力求节省；但是我们没有注意。本来应该用比较简单的人字架，却设计了非常复杂的穿斗式的房架，比人字架多用了一倍的木材。墙壁上一律是洋灰抹面，又抹石灰。屋顶一律使用洋灰瓦。总之，各种材料与建筑物的性质极不相称。按规定，这种宿舍每平方公尺应该用五十万元，但修起以后，不少单位竟用了八十万元。另外，在材料规格上，不研究木材出产的情况，而盲目地规定一律使用小圆木。许多单位为了按照设计施工，不得不去砍伐幼林。这种设计不仅在建筑上造成浪费，而且使国家的造林事业受到损失。
    在厂房的设计上也有许多类似的现象。譬如电器工业管理局某中型厂的厂房内有两吨半和五吨的两种吊车，吊车柱子和基础应该按不同的重量设计；但设计人员为了省事，一律按五吨设计了，浪费了
    一倍的材料和人工。该厂的研究室是一个二层楼的普通建筑，使用砖结构完全没有问题；但设计人员却采用了钢筋混凝土的构架，浪费了六亿多元，又延长了施工期。该厂房的附属建筑应该放在厂房之外，开门贯通，以节省厂房内的使用面积；但设计人员却采用了大房套小房的极不经济的办法，在以高价修起来的大厂房内摆进了一些小型建筑物。而且由于附属建筑在厂房之内，为了防火起见，也一律使用了钢屋架。再如一九五一年我们在哈尔滨设计的一个新建工厂除了所有的楼板和立柱都按旧方法计算以外，又毫无原则的加了百分之八的钢筋。设计门窗时，没有注意到玻璃生产的规格，安装时不得不把大片的玻璃切掉，造成很大浪费。在其它单位的设计上，我们也看到过这种现象。如我们曾看到苏联专家审核一个普通仓库的设计。当他审查到这个仓库的墙壁有三砖多厚时，便问：“这个仓库是存什么的呢？”设计者说“是存铁管子的。”专家说“铁管子怕不怕冻呢？”设计者说“不怕冻。”专家说：“既然铁管子不怕冻，这个仓库的设计，除了浪费以外，就没有其它意义了。”以上这些例子都说明设计工作者如果没有经济核算的思想，会给国家造成多么大的损失。
    如何加强设计工作中的经济核算呢？我认为主要的是提高我们设计人员的思想觉悟。设计人员应该明确认识：国家对设计工作的要求，不仅是要把房子盖起来，工厂修起来，而且要求我们技术要先进，在使用上要经济。有些人存在怕“沾包”，怕负责的思想，认为只要不出问题，浪费点材料人工没有啥。有的人认为设计错了没关系，可以再修改。他们没有认识到中途修改设计对施工的影响有多大。一九五二年设计的职工宿舍，由于空心墙发生了问题，中途进行修改，结果哈尔滨某工地的几十栋楼房，已经修起一层了，不得不拆掉重盖，使几千人数十天的劳动化为乌有。目前我们国家即将开始大规模的经济建设，国家要求我们，要以最节省的投资，设计最先进最合理的工厂和房舍。因此，在设计工作中贯彻经济核算思想，使国家的投资发挥最大的效能，应该是我们设计人员的一个光荣的严重的任务。
