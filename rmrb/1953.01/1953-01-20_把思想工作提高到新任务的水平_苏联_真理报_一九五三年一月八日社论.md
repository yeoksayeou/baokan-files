    Elevating Ideological Work to the Level of New Tasks
    -- Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda," January 8, 1953
    The historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Party, Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and his speech at the Congress, arming our Party and the entire Soviet people with a grand program for building communism, mark a new stage in the ideological life of the great Lenin-Stalin Party. After defining the main tasks of the Party during the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, the Congress strongly re-emphasized the great significance of ideological work as the Party's primary responsibility.

    The Communist Party, founded and nurtured by the genius of revolution, the master of Marxist science, Lenin and Stalin, is powerful because it is guided in all its activities by the most advanced theory – Marxism-Leninism. Our Party tirelessly raises the level of ideological work, arming cadres and all Party members with Marxist-Leninist theory and knowledge of the laws of social development.

    The issue of ideological work, of raising the ideological and political level of cadres and enabling them to master the great teachings of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, and the issue of the communist education of the masses have always been central to the attention of our Party. Back in 1934, Comrade Stalin, in defining the tasks of the Party in the field of ideological and political work, said:
    To raise the Party's theoretical level to the required height;
    To strengthen ideological work in all links of the Party;
    To tirelessly promote Leninism among Party members;
    To educate Party organizations and the non-Party activists around them in the spirit of Leninist internationalism;
    Not to conceal, but to boldly criticize individual comrades' deviations from Marxism-Leninism;
    To systematically expose the ideology and ideological remnants of anti-Leninist factions.

    Tremendous work has been done to implement these instructions of Comrade Stalin. In modern conditions, these instructions define the path of struggle to further improve the ideological work of the Party and all its local organizations.

    The 19th Congress of the Party demanded that Party organizations resolutely eradicate the harmful phenomenon of neglecting ideological work, strengthen this work in all links of the Party and government, and tirelessly expose various ideological manifestations that run counter to Marxism.

    In implementing the resolutions of the Congress, our Party organizations have implemented many measures to resolutely improve ideological work. Party organizations have widely discussed the issue of ideological work at meetings of activists summarizing the 19th Congress. Recently, in the largest Party organizations – Moscow, Leningrad, and Ukraine – these issues have become the object of comprehensive discussion at plenary sessions of the Party committees. The task of further improving ideological work has also been discussed at the plenary sessions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and at the plenary sessions of the Party committees of Sverdlovsk, Saratov, and many others.

    The plenary session of the Moscow Party Committee held a few days ago comprehensively discussed the current state of ideological work of the Moscow Oblast Party Organization and measures to improve it. The plenary session showed that the criticism of the ideological work of the Moscow Party Organization in Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Party was justified.

    After the 19th Congress of the Party, the Party organizations of Moscow City and Moscow Oblast strengthened their attention to ideological issues, and launched an explanation and study campaign among the working people regarding the documents and resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Party and Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Millions of Party members and non-Party masses began to study these historic documents in political schools, groups, research classes, Marxist-Leninist evening universities, and evening Party schools.

    At the same time, the plenary session of the Moscow Oblast Committee also showed that there are serious shortcomings in the ideological work of the Moscow Oblast Party Organization. Many Party organizations have not yet overcome the phenomenon of neglecting ideological work, and have not given the necessary attention to improving the organization of Party propaganda, especially the content of Party propaganda.

    At the plenary sessions of the Moscow and Leningrad Oblast Committees, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, and many other Party committees that discussed the issue of ideological work, the focus of attention was on the issue of raising the ideological and theoretical level of our cadres. This is entirely reasonable. Comrade Stalin instructed that if we can ideologically cultivate the personnel in all our work departments to such an extent, and politically temper them to such an extent, that they can readily recognize the domestic and international situation, if we can make them highly mature Marxist-Leninists who can solve the problems of state leadership without making any serious mistakes, then we have every reason to believe that nine-tenths of all our problems have been solved.

    The heroic history of our Party teaches us that the strength of the old cadres of the Party lies in their familiarity with Marxist-Leninist theory and in their profound knowledge of Marxist political economy. The Party is powerful precisely because its basic cadres resolutely, consciously, and consistently stand on the position of Marxism-Leninism. The task is to ensure that the young staff who are constantly replenishing the cadres of the Party and the state do not lag behind the old cadres in terms of ideological theory, that they deeply study Marxist-Leninist theory, especially economic theory. All our cadres, without exception, should improve their ideological and theoretical level and master the Party's rich political experience so that they do not fall behind life and can be competent in the Party's tasks.

    As indicated at the plenary sessions of the various Party committees, by no means all Party, Soviet, economic, trade union, and Youth League workers fully realize and practically implement the Party's primary obligation – to persist in continuously improving their ideological and theoretical level and mastering Marxist-Leninist theory. The participants of the plenary sessions rightly recalled the Party's warning: those who lag behind in ideological and political terms cannot correctly analyze the domestic and international situation, and cannot at the same time be worthy of standing at the forefront of the movement. Such people will sooner or later be eliminated by life.

    Making every effort to improve Party education and raise its ideological and theoretical level should be a constant concern of every Party organization. At present, the most important task in all propaganda work of the Party organization is to publicize and deeply study the historic resolutions of the 19th Congress, Comrade Stalin's speech at the Congress, and his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Millions of Party members and non-Party members are now studying these historic documents.

    In order to ensure that the lessons in political schools, groups, research classes, Marxist-Leninist evening universities, and evening Party schools have a high ideological and theoretical level, we must first strengthen the cadre of propagandists with Communists who are theoretically well-trained, have prestige within the Party organization, and can successfully carry out the great and noble cause of propagating the victorious ideas of Marxism-Leninism. Propagandists and agitators are the Party's ideological fighters and should be nurtured and educated with concern. Now, when the Party education system is facing particularly important tasks, Party organizations need to pay constant attention to propagandists and provide them with concrete assistance.

    To concretely lead the cause of Party education means to resolutely oppose the incorrect working methods of many of our local Party committees and their propaganda departments, and to resolutely oppose the method of putting the "scale" of participation in learning and the statistics of attendance at groups and schools in the first place, while postponing the main issues – the theoretical level of a certain group's course, the ideological direction of these courses, and the ideological growth of each Party member – to the second place. Party workers should regularly attend classes in groups and schools, deeply study the content of the lessons, urge propagandists to improve the theoretical level of propaganda work, and teach them to creatively connect the propaganda of Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's policies with the specific tasks of communist construction. We should help propagandists connect the practical work of everyone studying theory with the struggle of the whole people for communism, guide students from understanding small things to understanding big things, educate them to be uncompromising in the face of any manifestation of hostile ideology, and cultivate in them the outstanding qualities of a fighter for the cause of the Lenin-Stalin Party and an active builder of communism.

    In the struggle to improve ideological work, the powerful weapon of Party organizations is the press. Party organizations can skillfully use newspapers and magazines to concretely and effectively lead all areas of the ideological front, promote our Soviet ideology, fight against the manifestations of anti-Leninist views, and expose the misanthropic ideology of imperialism. However, as was correctly expressed at the recent plenary sessions of the Moscow and Leningrad Party Oblast Committees and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, our newspapers and magazines are still not performing this important and responsible task well enough. At some of the above-mentioned plenary sessions, the shortcomings in the work of the magazines "Moscow Propagandist," "Propaganda and Agitation," "Communist of Ukraine," and the newspapers "Moscow Truth," "Leningrad Truth," "Ukrainian Truth," and "Dear Ukraine" were severely criticized. One of the biggest shortcomings of these magazines and newspapers is that their elaboration of ideological work issues is still weak. They publish few authoritative articles, speeches, and answers on Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues, and do not give Party organizations the due help in summarizing and disseminating the experience of propaganda work and in launching self-criticism and criticism from below.

    At the plenary sessions of the Party committees, great importance was attached to the work of creative organizations, universities, and scientific institutions, and to the task of the ideological and political education of writers, artists, and scientific workers. It was pointed out that the role of literature and art must be enhanced in the communist education of the working people, in the struggle against bourgeois ideology and the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, in cultivating the new and bright and in eradicating the stale and stagnant in social life. Workers in literature and art should study the life of Soviet society more deeply, should bring to the masses the noble ideas of Lenin-Stalin's internationalism, the ideas of Soviet patriotism, and the ideas of friendship among all nationalities, and they should create great works of art worthy of our great people and our great era.

    Not all local Party organizations have overcome the phenomenon of neglecting ideological work. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan does not delve deeply enough into various ideological issues. As early as the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan in the spring of last year, some serious shortcomings and mistakes in leading the republic's ideological work were pointed out. The plenary session adopted a resolution on strengthening ideological work. Much time has passed since then, but there has been no significant change in leading this cause in the republic. The issue of ideological work is rarely heard at the meetings of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, and it is usually without any serious discussion. The facts show that the staff of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan are only one-sidedly immersed in current economic issues, and have almost no interest or taste in ideological issues.

    The ideological work of the Party's Gorky Oblast Committee still has many shortcomings to date. In Gorky City, one of the country's major industrial and cultural centers, there are all the conditions to widely launch ideological work and raise it to a high level. However, neither the Party's Oblast Committee nor the Gorky City Committee has expressed genuine concern for this work. The following fact can fully prove the neglect of ideological work: the plenary session of the Gorky Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was convened after the 19th Congress of the Party, did not discuss any ideological issues, just like the plenary session of the Gorky City Committee that was convened not long ago. Can we no longer tolerate this attitude towards ideological work, is it not clear yet?

    The 19th Congress of the Party demanded that this phenomenon of neglecting ideological work be eliminated, and instructed that it is necessary to carry out a resolute struggle against liberalism and indifference towards ideological errors and distortions; to constantly raise and improve the ideological and political cultivation of our cadres; to use all the tools that influence ideology, our propaganda, agitation, and the press, in the cause of the communist education of the Soviet people; to raise Soviet science to a higher level, to launch criticism and debate in scientific work, and to remember that only in this way can Soviet science fulfill its mission – to occupy the first place in world science.

    The task of Party organizations is to tirelessly arm cadres, all Party members, and the broad masses of working people with the knowledge of the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Party and Comrade Stalin's doctrine on building communism. In order to implement the great program of communist construction, such a demand is put forward to Party organizations – to raise ideological work to the level of the historic tasks facing our Party and our Soviet people.

    把思想工作提高到新任务的水平
    ——苏联“真理报”一九五三年一月八日社论
    党的第十九次代表大会的历史性决议，斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和他在代表大会上的演说，以建设共产主义的巨大纲领武装着我们的党和全体苏联人民，标志着伟大的列宁—斯大林党的思想生活中的新阶段。代表大会在确定了党由社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡的时期中的主要任务后，重新有力地强调指出作为党的首要职责的思想工作的巨大意义。
    为革命的天才、马克思主义科学的巨匠列宁和斯大林所创立和抚育起来的共产党之所以有力，因为它在自己的全部活动中，都是以最先进的理论——马克思列宁主义为指南的。我党不倦地提高着思想工作的水平，以马克思列宁主义的理论、以社会发展法则的知识来武装干部，武装全体共产党员。
    思想工作问题，提高干部的思想政治水平和使他们掌握马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的伟大学说的问题，群众的共产主义教育问题，始终都是我党注意的中心。还在一九三四年时，斯大林同志在确定党在思想政治工作方面的任务时，就说过：
    要把党的理论水准提到应有的高度；
    要在党的一切环节中加强思想工作；
    要在党员中间努力不倦地宣传列宁主义；
    要用列宁的国际主义精神来教育党组织及其周围的非党积极分子；
    不要掩饰，而要大胆批评个别同志离开马克思列宁主义的偏向；
    要有系统地揭露反列宁主义派别的思想和思想余毒。
    为了实现斯大林同志的这些指示进行了巨大工作。在现代条件下，这些指示确定着争取进一步提高党及其全部地方组织的思想工作的斗争道路。
    党的第十九次代表大会要求党组织坚决铲除有害的不重视思想工作的现象，要在党和政府的各个环节中加强这一工作，不倦地揭露与马克思主义背道而驰的各种思想表现。
    我们的党组织在实现代表大会的决议时，实行了许多坚决提高思想工作的措施。各党组织都在关于第十九次代表大会总结的积极分子会议上，广泛地讨论了思想工作问题。最近，在各个最庞大的党组织——莫斯科、列宁格勒和乌克兰的党组织内，这些问题成为了党委会全会全面讨论的对象。进一步提高思想工作的任务，也在格鲁吉亚、阿塞拜疆共产党的中央委员会全会上，在斯维尔德洛夫斯克、萨拉托夫和许多其他党委会全会上讨论过。
    前几天举行的莫斯科党委会全会，全面讨论了莫斯科州党组织的思想工作现状及其改善措施。全会表明，莫斯科党组织的思想工作，在马林科夫同志在党的第十九次代表大会上的报告中所受到的批评是公正的。
    莫斯科市和莫斯科州的党组织，在党的第十九次代表大会之后，加强了对思想问题的注意，在劳动人民之间展开了对党的第十九次代表大会的文件和决议、斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的解释和研究工作。千百万的共产党员和非党群众开始在政治学校、小组、研究班、马克思列宁主义夜大学和夜党校中研究这些历史性的文件。
    同时，莫斯科州委会的全会也表明了，在莫斯科州党组织的思想工作中，存在有严重的缺点。许多党组织还未克服不重视思想工作的现象，对于改善党的宣传组织、特别是党的宣传内容方面，没有给予必要的注意。
    在讨论思想工作问题的莫斯科和列宁格勒州委会、乌克兰共产党中央委员会以及其他许多党委会的全会上，关于提高我们干部的思想理论水平问题，是会议注意的重心。这是完全合理的。斯大林同志指示说，如果我们能把我们所有各工作部门中的干部人员在思想上造就到这样的程度，在政治上把他们锻炼到这样的程度，使得他们能够随时认清国内环境和国际环境，如果我们能够把他们造成为十分成熟的马克思列宁主义者，使得他们能够解决国家领导问题而不犯什么严重错误，那么我们就有一切根据，认为我们所有的问题十分之九都已经解决了。
    我们党的英勇历史教导我们，党的老干部的力量就在于他们熟知马克思列宁主义的理论，在于他们对马克思主义的政治经济学有深邃的知识。党之所以有力，正是因为它的基本干部坚决地、自觉地和始终不渝地站在马克思列宁主义的立场。任务在于使不断地补充着党和国家的干部的年青工作人员，在思想理论方面不落后于老干部，使他们深刻研究马克思列宁主义理论，首先是经济理论。我们的全体干部，毫无例外，都应该提高自己的思想理论水平，掌握党的丰富的政治经验，这样才不会落在生活后面和能够胜任党的任务。
    正如在党的各委员会的全会上所表明的，远非全体党的、苏维埃的、经济的、职工会的和青年团的工作人员，都充分认识到并在实际上执行党的首要义务——坚持不断地提高自己的思想理论水平，掌握马克思列宁主义理论。各全会的参加者正确地想起了党的这一警告：在思想政治方面落后的人，便不能正确分析国内外的形势，便不能同时也不配站在运动的前列，这样的人迟早会被生活淘汰的。
    尽力改善党教育，提高其思想理论水平，应该是每一党组织经常关怀的事情。目前在党组织的全部宣传工作中，最重要的是宣传和深刻研究第十九次代表大会的历史性决议、斯大林同志在代表大会上的演说和他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。现在数以百万计的共产党员和非党员都正在研究这些历史性的文件。
    为了保证政治学校、小组、研究班、马克思列宁主义夜大学和夜党校中的功课有高度的思想理论水平，首先必须以理论修养好的，在党组织内有威信的，能够成功地进行宣传马克思列宁主义这一常胜思想的伟大而高贵事业的共产党员，来加强宣传员干部。宣传员和鼓动员是党的思想战士，应该关切地培养和教育他们。现在，当党教育系统面临着特殊重大的任务时，党组织需要对宣传员经常注意并给以具体帮助。
    具体地领导党教育的事业，就是说要坚决反对我们许多地方党委会及其宣传部的不正确的工作方法，坚决反对把关于参加学习的“规模”和出席小组和学校听讲的次数的统计材料提到第一位，而把主要的问题——某一小组课程的理论水平、这些课程的思想方针和每个共产党员的思想成长推延到第二位的这种方法。党的工作人员应当经常出席小组和学校听课，深刻研究功课的内容，使宣传员努力提高宣传工作的理论水平，教导他们创造性地与共产主义建设的具体任务密切联系着来宣传马克思列宁主义的理论和党的政策。应当帮助宣传员把每一个研究理论的人的实际工作与争取共产主义的全民斗争联系起来，引导学员从理解小事情到理解大事情，教育他们对敌对思想的任何表现决不妥协，陶冶他们为列宁—斯大林党的事业而斗争的战士和共产主义积极建造者的卓越品质。
    在争取提高思想工作的斗争中，党组织的强大武器就是报刊。党组织巧妙地运用报纸和杂志，便能够具体地和有成效地领导思想战线的各个领域，宣传我们的苏维埃思想体系，与敌视列宁主义的观点的表现进行斗争，揭露帝国主义的仇视人类的思想体系。但是，正如在莫斯科和列宁格勒党的州委会以及乌克兰共产党中央委员会最近举行的全会上所正确表现出来的，我们的报纸和杂志对这一重要的和责任重大的任务仍然执行得不够好。在上述的一些全会上，“莫斯科宣传员”、“宣传与鼓动”、“乌克兰共产党人”杂志和“莫斯科真理报”、“列宁格勒真理报”、“乌克兰真理报”和“亲爱的乌克兰”等报纸工作中的缺点，都曾遭受了严厉的批评。这些杂志和报纸的最大缺点之一，就是他们对于思想工作问题的阐述仍是软弱的，它们发表的权威性的文章、演讲和关于马克思列宁主义理论问题的解答很少，在总结和传播宣传工作的经验方面，在展开自我批评和来自下面的批评方面，没有给党组织以应有的帮助。
    在党委会的全会上，对创作组织、高等学校和科学机关的工作，对作家、艺术与科学工作者的思想政治教育的任务，都是十分重视的。指出了在劳动人民的共产主义教育中，在反对资产阶级思想和人们意识中资本主义残余的斗争中，在培养新的、光明的和铲除社会生活中的陈腐的和停滞的斗争中必须提高文学与艺术的作用。文学和艺术工作者应当更深刻地研究苏维埃社会的生活，应当把高贵的列宁—斯大林的国际主义的思想、苏维埃的爱国主义思想和各族友爱的思想带到群众中去，文学和艺术工作者应当创作堪配我们伟大人民和我们伟大时代的巨大艺术作品。
    并非所有的地方党组织都克服了对思想工作轻视的现象。乌兹别克斯坦共产党中央委员会对各种思想问题钻研得不够。还在去年春季的乌兹别克斯坦共产党中央委员会的全会上，就指出了在领导共和国的思想工作中的一些严重缺点和错误。在全会上曾通过了关于加强思想工作的决议。从那时起已过了许多时日，但是在领导共和国内的这一事业方面，还没有显著的变化。思想工作问题在中央委员会常委会上很少听到，而且通常是没有经过任何认真的讨论。事实说明，乌兹别克斯坦共产党中央委员会的工作人员，只单方面地醉心于当前的经济问题，而对于思想问题几乎是没有任何兴趣，任何口味。
    党的高尔基州委会的思想工作中迄今仍有许多缺点。在国内大工业和文化中心之一的高尔基市，具有一切条件来广泛展开思想工作并把它提到高度水平。但是，无论党的州委会，无论高尔基市委会对这一工作都没有表示真正的关怀。下面的这个事实可以充分证明对于思想工作轻视的情况，在党的第十九次代表大会后召开的苏联共产党高尔基州委会全会，也和不久以前召开过的高尔基市委会全会一样，没有讨论任何一个思想问题。我们再不能忍受对待思想工作的这种态度，还不清楚吗？
    党的第十九次代表大会要求消灭这种对思想工作不重视的现象，指示出必须与对待思想错误和歪曲的自由主义和漠不关心的态度进行坚决的斗争；经常提高和改善我们干部的思想政治的修养；把一切影响思想的工具，我们的宣传、鼓动和报刊用在苏联人民共产主义教育的事业上；把苏联的科学提到更高的水平，在科学工作中展开批评与辩论，要记住，只有用这种方法，苏联科学才能完成自己的使命——在世界科学中占第一位。
    党组织的任务，就是用党的第十九次代表大会决议的知识和斯大林同志的关于建设共产主义的学说，不倦地来武装干部、全体共产党员和广大的劳动群众。为了实现伟大的共产主义建设纲领而给党组织提出了这样的要求——把思想工作提高到摆在我们党、我们苏联人民面前的历史性任务的水平。
