Central Industrial and Transportation Departments Strengthen Design Institutions

[Report from this newspaper] Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government decided last October to prioritize basic construction, the central industrial and transportation departments have vigorously strengthened design departments, the most important and relatively weak link in basic construction.

The First Ministry of Machine Building is a newly established ministry and originally had no specialized design institutions. It began establishing a design department in early December. By the end of the year, the ministry and its subordinate bureaus had gathered nearly 1,500 direct design personnel in machinery, electrical engineering, and automobiles. The leadership of the ministry attaches great importance to design work. Minister Huang Jing and Vice Minister Wang Daohan personally went to Shanghai to organize design forces. The Ministry of Heavy Industry originally had only four or five people in the Planning Department managing design work. Now the ministry has established a design department, and each administration bureau has established a design division. It is also preparing to transfer 1,200 to 1,400 technical personnel from the production sector to strengthen the design departments. The design strength of the Ministry of Fuel Industry has grown significantly in the past two months, with the power system increasing by more than 70 percent and the coal mining system by 160 percent. Most of the personnel transferred from the production sector this time have been assigned to the design departments. The Ministry of Railways has greatly strengthened its design institutions since October of last year, with the number of design personnel in the design bureau increasing from more than 600 to more than 1,200. A relatively large number of cadres have been transferred to the design departments this time. Currently, technical personnel in civil engineering and construction in the design departments of the ministry account for 30 percent of the entire railway system. In the past, the Ministry of Communications did not separate design and construction departments. Now, departments at the level of major administrative regions under the Ministry of Communications have established or are in the process of establishing design companies. When the Ministry of Textile Industry transferred cadres, it gave the best to the design departments. The Ministry of Construction Engineering has also vigorously strengthened its design institutions.

In addition to strengthening design forces and establishing and improving design institutions, each department generally tries to concentrate the direct production part of design, that is, the forces directly engaged in design, and prepare to gradually transition to establishing separate and unified design institutes. This will avoid the waste of design forces due to repeated designs in different locations and will help improve the quality of design. Some departments concentrated their efforts earlier, such as the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which has concentrated all its design personnel. Most departments are still in a transitional stage. Although the main design forces and the design tasks of important projects are concentrated in the ministry and bureaus, the institutions are still relatively dispersed from an organizational perspective. For example, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has merged the original design department and directly affiliated design companies to form a design institute and design branch institutes, and most of the design forces are concentrated at the ministry and major administrative region level. However, a considerable amount of strength remains in various provinces and cities that has not been organized. The design forces in the machinery section of the First Ministry of Machine Building are dispersed in the Northeast region and in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing. The design forces in the electrical engineering section are dispersed in the Northeast and Northwest regions, as well as in Shanghai and Hunan provinces. Some departments have basically not concentrated their forces. For example, the design forces of the Petroleum Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Highway General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications are still dispersed at various construction sites and in various provinces.

Departments that have gathered design forces, in order to further improve design efficiency and design level, some have established specialized organizations according to the principle of professional division of labor. For example, the design department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has established twelve specialized design groups for mining, ore dressing, iron smelting, chemical industry, steelmaking, steel rolling, equipment, civil engineering, electrical engineering, power, water and heating, and general layout. The design offices of the Ministry of Railways are also divided into professional departments to handle important designs such as large bridges, large railway factories, large stations, and communication signals. The design departments of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Heavy Industry, as well as the Ministry of Textile Industry, are also divided into professional departments; however, due to insufficient manpower, the division is not detailed enough.

Although the leaders of each department have spent great efforts to strengthen design institutions, compared with the requirements of national construction tasks, the design forces are still far from sufficient. Except for the number of design personnel in the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the coal mining system, which can roughly meet the requirements of the 1953 design tasks, most other departments cannot meet the needs. According to the 1953 tasks and the requirements of the national long-term plan, the Ministry of Heavy Industry lacks more than 3,400 design personnel. The Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau lacks nine-tenths of the personnel needed to cooperate with foreign experts in design. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has the strongest design force, but it is still short by half. At the same time, the quality of the existing design force is not high. Among the design personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, those with one or two years of design experience account for only 22 percent, and students who graduated less than half a year ago account for 57 percent. Except for the two design offices in the Northeast for machinery and electrical engineering, which have some experience, the other nine units of the First Ministry of Machine Building have no design experience. Many design personnel are still fascinated by British and American technical standards, and bourgeois design thinking is still very strong.

In order to solve the contradiction between force and demand, various ministries have thought of many ways. For example, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has begun to organize design personnel to study Soviet design experience. In addition to organizing design personnel to study Soviet and domestic advanced design experience, the First Ministry of Machine Building is also preparing to adjust the design forces in various regions and industries according to the requirements of the tasks. In addition, various ministries have established or are preparing to establish various schools and training classes to cultivate reserve forces in design. The Ministry of Railways has established geology training classes, surveying and mapping training classes, and testing training classes. The Ministry of Construction Engineering has opened training classes for heating and sanitary equipment and soil testing training classes, and is also preparing to open secondary technical schools in Beijing and major administrative regions. The First Ministry of Machine Building has opened a drawing school. However, most units have not yet formulated long-term plans on how to increase design forces.

    中央工业交通各部加强设计机构
    【本报讯】自去年十月中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会决定把基本建设提到首要地位之后，中央各工业、交通部门都大力加强了基本建设中最重要而又比较薄弱的环节——设计部门。
    第一机械工业部是新成立的一个部，原来没有专门的设计机构。去年十二月初开始成立设计司；到年底，该部及所属各局已集结了机械、电工、汽车等方面的直接设计人员近一千五百人。该部领导方面十分重视设计工作。黄敬部长和汪道涵副部长曾亲自到上海去组织设计力量。重工业部原来只在计划司下有四、五个人管理设计工作。现在部里成立了设计司，各管理局都成立了设计处，并准备继续从生产方面抽调一千二百名至一千四百名技术人员充实设计部门。燃料工业部的设计力量在最近两个月中增长了很多，电业系统增加了百分之七十以上，煤矿系统增加了百分之一百六十。这次从生产方面抽调的人员，大部分充实了设计部门。铁道部在去年十月以后，设计机构大大加强，设计局的设计人员从六百多人增加到一千二百多人。此次抽调的干部，分配到设计部门的也比较多。现在该部设计部门中土木建筑方面的技术人员已占全铁道系统的百分之三十。交通部过去设计和施工部门不分，现在交通部所属各大行政区一级的部门都已经或正在成立设计公司。纺织工业部在抽调干部时，把最好的都给了设计部门。建筑工程部也大力加强了设计机构。
    各个部门除了加强设计力量，建立和健全设计机构外，对设计中的直接生产部分，即直接进行设计的力量，一般都尽量加以集中，准备逐步过渡到成立单独的统一的设计院。这样，就可以避免各地重复做同样的设计，浪费设计力量，并有助于提高设计的质量。有些部门集中得比较早，如重工业部化学工业管理局已将所属全部设计人员集中起来。多数部门还处在过渡阶段，虽然主要设计力量和重要工程的设计任务都集中到部与局，但从机构上看，还比较分散。如建筑工程部已将原设计处和直属设计公司合并成立了设计院和设计分院，设计力量大部集中在部与大行政区一级，但各省、市还保有相当大的力量未组织起来。第一机械工业部机械部分的设计力量分散在东北区及北京、上海、武汉、重庆等市；电工部分的则分散在东北区与西北区以及上海市和湖南省等四处。有些部门基本上没有集中。如燃料工业部的石油工业管理局、交通部的公路总局，设计力量至今还都分散在各工程现场和各省。
    已经集结了设计力量的部门，为了便于进一步提高设计效率和设计水平，有的已按专业分工的原则分别成立了专门的组织。如鞍山钢铁公司的设计处就成立了矿山、选矿、炼铁、化工、炼钢、轧钢、设备、土木建筑、电气、动力、水暖、总图等十二个专业设计组。铁道部的设计事务所也按专业分科，分别担任大桥、大的铁路工厂、大车站和通讯信号等重要设计。第一机械工业部和重工业部所属各局，以及纺织工业部的设计部门，也都是按专业分科的；只是由于人力不足，分得还不够细致。
    各部门的领导方面虽然花了很大力量来加强设计机构，但与国家建设任务的要求相比，设计力量仍然十分不足。除纺织工业部、铁道部与煤矿系统的设计人员数量可以大体满足一九五三年设计任务的要求外，其他部门大都还不能满足需要。重工业部设计人员按照一九五三年的任务和国家长远计划的要求，还缺少三千四百余人。有色金属管理局只是配合国外专家进行设计的人员，即缺少十分之九。鞍山钢铁公司设计力量是最强的，也还缺少一半。同时，现有设计力量的质量也不高。鞍山钢铁公司设计人员中有一二年设计经验的只占百分之二十二，毕业不到半年的学生占百分之五十七。第一机械工业部除东北的机械与电工两个设计处还有一些经验外，其他九个单位都没有设计经验。有不少设计人员还迷恋于英美的技术标准，资产阶级的设计思想还很浓厚。
    为了解决力量与要求不相适应的矛盾，各部都想了很多办法。如燃料工业部已开始组织设计人员学习苏联设计经验。第一机械工业部除了组织设计人员学习苏联和国内先进设计经验外，并准备根据任务的要求，调整各地区和各行业的设计力量。此外，各部还设立了或正在筹备设立各种学校和训练班，培养设计方面的后备力量。铁道部已成立了地质训练班、勘测训练班和化验训练班；建筑工程部开办了暖气、卫生设备训练班和土壤试验训练班，还准备在北京和各大行政区开办中等技术学校；第一机械工业部已开办了绘图学校。但如何增长设计力量的长期计划，大部单位尚未制定。
