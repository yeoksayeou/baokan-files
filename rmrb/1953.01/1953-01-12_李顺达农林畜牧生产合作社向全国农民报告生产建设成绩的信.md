To agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, labor models, and farmer brothers and sisters across the country who have accepted our challenge:

    Our patriotic production increase plan for 1952 has been basically victoriously completed. The average yield per mu of all autumn crops was 442 jin, exceeding the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan yield by 143%, exceeding the 1951 yield (average yield per mu of 370 jin) by 19.46%, and exceeding the 1952 production increase plan (average yield per mu of 423 jin) by over 4%. The yield of 28.1 mu of high-yield land reached the high-yield reward standard set by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Labor models from the Yuncheng Special Zone who came to our village to visit said: "Even rocky land can produce a thousand jin!" Truly, there is only backward farming technology, and no land that cannot achieve high yields! Our entire cooperative distributed grain, and every household has full granaries. The production team leader, old man Song Jinshan, said with emotion: "Cooperative members are all treasures, and the agricultural production cooperative is a treasure bowl; collective management leads to higher yields, enriching the country and the people with no one left poor." Everyone felt that this was very true. If each family managed their own affairs, it would be impossible to achieve a bumper harvest for every household.

    The above is only about our achievements in agriculture; more importantly, in the spring of 1952, we jointly formulated a three-year construction plan with the masses of the entire village (Note: "The Three-Year Construction Plan of Xigou Village" was published in this newspaper on page 2 on November 5, 1952). In this plan, in addition to continuing to comprehensively improve the yield per unit area of grain, we also established methods for developing forestry and animal husbandry. Everyone in our village cares about this three-year construction plan. Old and young throughout the village collectively created a folk song, singing: Focus on characteristics when building in the mountains, develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry together. Grain yield must be increased, aiming for 530 jin per mu. The yield of terraced fields on mountain slopes is low, so stopping cultivation and returning to forest is most important; afforesting one thousand mu in three years, planting ten thousand trees must be achieved. Plant mulberry trees for silkworms around houses and villages, plant pine and cypress trees and willows by the river on the back of the mountain, plant fruit trees on the sunny slopes, and green the whole gully for beautiful scenery. Develop livestock to one hundred and twenty, and let nine hundred sheep roam the mountains; move the members of the cooperative from the back gully to the village, and turn the mountain houses into cattle pens. Raise one hundred pigs in three years, turning the poor gully into a livestock farm; raise small ones and sell old ones for great income, ensuring manure for the fields. First repair one hundred mu of river beaches, turning the bluestone river beaches into fertile fields; then build sixty houses, and move all the members into new houses. Build reservoirs in the mountain gullies to irrigate the fields and raise ducks, with fish playing among the lotus flowers; build two vehicle roads for smooth transportation, making it convenient to transport manure and harvest crops. Implement a consistent system in primary schools, widely spread literacy through accelerated courses; build health and maternity stations, so that both people and wealth flourish and everyone is happy. Listen to the radio in the club, and go to the library to read books; work well and play happily, greatly developing culture and entertainment. Surplus labor is not surplus, men and women, old and young, work together with one heart, write names on the merit book, and glorious deeds will be passed down through the ages. Once the three-year plan is realized, we will have more than enough red meat and white flour to eat; young men and women will wear wool sweaters, and the elderly will also wear fur coats. Even with endless food and clothing, we will not be complacent; we will keep Shunda's words in mind and continue to learn from the Soviet Union.

    Formulating the plan allowed us to see a bright future and dispelled the confused thinking of those who originally believed that mountain areas had no prospects for development and wanted to move down the mountain. We all feel that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the sun shines red everywhere, even the black mountain gullies are bright, and socialism can be realized everywhere. We are working according to this plan and have already made considerable achievements in animal husbandry and forestry. We originally had only one hundred sheep, but now we have increased to six hundred and fourteen; in the spring of 1953, we will breed about three hundred lambs. In this way, the plan to raise nine hundred sheep in three years can be completed ahead of schedule. Animal husbandry can not only increase our income but also increase fertilizer, supporting agriculture. Therefore, we have selected six experienced cooperative members to specialize in animal husbandry, achieving division of labor, specialization, and responsibility.

    In implementing the three-year plan, we adhered to the principle of combining current and long-term interests, and decided to first build water conservancy projects and then build houses and move. In one year, we used a total of more than 1,200 workdays in basic construction, accounting for 36% of all workdays throughout the year. Before the plan was formulated, surplus labor had nothing to do, but now there is not enough labor. If it were not for collective management, some of the larger construction projects could not be done at all.

    We were able to invest a lot of effort in basic construction for two reasons. One is that this year (1952) we implemented the method of "four fixings for living work" (fixing quality, quantity, work, and time) and contracting production, which improved labor efficiency and saved more than 500 workdays; the other is that we attached importance to mobilizing women to participate in major labor. We conscientiously implemented equal pay for equal work for men and women, and all 24 women in the cooperative participated in production. In addition to their family work, they did more than 870 workdays, accounting for 35% of the total agricultural work. After women participated in production, they changed their position in the family; six model families of democracy, harmony, unity, and production have emerged in the village. This shows that women's participation in production is the only way to truly liberate themselves and also a huge force in the country's large-scale economic construction.

    How are your bumper harvests and basic construction work in 1952 going? We hope to see your good news.

    Sincerely,

    Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative

### 李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社向全国农民报告生产建设成绩的信

    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社
    向全国农民报告生产建设成绩的信全国各地向我们应战的农业生产合作社、互助组、劳动模范和农民兄弟姐妹们：
    我们一九五二年的爱国增产计划基本上胜利完成了。全部秋田每亩平均产量是四百四十二斤，超过了抗日战争以前产量百分之一百四十三，超过一九五一年产量（每亩平均产粮三百七十斤）百分之十九点四六，超过一九五二年增产计划（每亩平均产粮四百二十三斤）百分之四强。有二十八亩一分丰产地的产量达到了中央人民政府农业部规定的丰产奖励标准。来我们村参观的运城专区的劳动模范们说：石头圪垃产千斤！真是只有落后的种地技术，没有不能丰产的土地！我们全社分配了粮食，家家户户都是柜平囤满。生产队长宋金山老汉感动地说：“社员都是活宝贝，农业生产合作社是聚宝盆；集体经营产量多，富国裕民没穷人。”大家都觉得这话真是在理。要是各家管各家的话，怎样也做不到家家庆丰收。
    上面说的还只是我们在农业方面的成绩；更重要的是我们在一九五二年春天和全村群众共同订了个三年建设计划（按：“西沟村的三年建设计划”本报已在一九五二年十一月五日第二版发表）。在这个计划里，我们除了继续全面提高粮食的单位面积产量以外，并且定出了发展林业和畜牧业的办法。我们村子里的人没有不关心这个三年建设计划的。全村老少你一句我一句集体创作了一个歌谣，唱了起来：建设山地抓特点，农林畜牧齐发展。粮食产量要提高，每亩要产五百三（斤）。山坡梯田产量少，停耕还林最重要；三年造林一千亩，植树一万要做到。家前屋后养蚕桑，山背松柏河柳杨，阳坡栽种五果树，全沟绿化好风光。发展牲口一百二，九百只羊放满山；后沟社员搬村里，山庄窝铺做牛圈。三年喂猪一百口，穷沟变成畜牧场；养小卖老收入大，保证地里有粪上。百亩滩地先修建，青石河滩变良田；然后盖房六十间，社员都往新房搬。山沟闸起蓄水池，浇地养鸭鱼戏莲；两条车路修通达，运粪收秋都方便。小学实行一贯制，速成识字普遍传；建设卫生接产站，人财两旺都喜欢。俱乐部听无线电，看书就到图书馆；劳动得好玩得欢，文化娱乐大发展。剩余劳力不剩余，男女老少齐心干，名字写上功劳簿，光荣事迹万古传。三年计划一实现，红肉白面吃不完；青年男女穿毛衣，老人也把皮袄穿。吃不尽来穿不完，我们可也不自满；顺达的话记心间，还要好好学苏联。
    订计划使我们看到了美好的远景，也打消了那些原来认为山地没有发展前途，想搬下山去的人的糊涂思想。我们都感到：在毛主席的领导下，太阳照得遍地红，黑山沟里也光亮了，那里都能实现社会主义。我们照着这个计划干，在畜牧业和林业方面已经做出了不少成绩。我们原来只有一百多只羊，现在已增加到六百一十四只；一九五三年春天，将要繁殖小羊约三百只。这样，三年养到九百只羊的计划就可以提前完成了。畜牧业不但可以使我们增加收入，而且增加了肥料，支援了农业。因此，我们抽出有经验的社员六个人专做畜牧工作，做到了分工分业专职专责。
    在实行三年计划中，我们本着当前利益和长远利益相结合的方针，确定先兴修水利后盖房搬家。一年里我们用在基本建设方面的人力共计有一千二百多个劳动日，占全年各种劳动日的百分之三十六。没有订计划以前，剩余劳力没事干，现在倒是劳力不够用了。如果不是集体经营，一些比较大的建设工作一项也办不到。
    我们能在基本建设方面投入很大力量，一个原因是今年（一九五二年）我们实行了按活四定（定质、定量、定工、定时）、包工生产的办法，提高了劳动效率，省工五百多个；另一个原因是重视了发动妇女参加主要劳动。我们切实实行了男女同工同酬，全社二十四个妇女都参加了生产，她们除家庭工作外，做了八百七十多个劳动日，占农业总工数的百分之三十五。妇女参加生产后就改变了自己在家庭中的地位；全村已出现了六户民主和睦团结生产的模范家庭。这说明了，妇女参加生产是真正解放自己的唯一道路，也是国家大规模经济建设中的巨大力量。
    你们一九五二年的丰产结果和基本建设工作做得怎样？希望看到你们的喜讯。此致敬礼
