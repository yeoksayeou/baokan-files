    I Learned an Important Lesson
    ——Reflections on Playing the Role of Kulepin in "Dawn Over Moscow"
    Li Meran
    When our theater decided to stage the play "Dawn Over Moscow," the leadership assigned me the task of playing Kulepin, the factory Party secretary. I was too young and lacked stage experience, making it difficult to grasp the thoughts and feelings of the character in the play. There were many difficulties. Kulepin is a character cultivated under socialist education. In the great Patriotic War, he engaged in Party work in the army. He understands the people, knows what the people oppose, and what they pursue. Under the guidance and inspiration of Director Yan Zheng, I worked hard to overcome the difficulties of playing this role.
    Kulepin stands at the forefront of contradictions and struggles at all times, grasping and resolving them. In accordance with Party principles, he optimistically and unwaveringly leads the masses in a tireless struggle against conservative ideas that are divorced from the masses, and always supports the workers' labor and creation. He is not afraid of attacks from the female factory director, Kabitilina, nor the sarcasm of Bashlykov, the representative of the Ministry of Textile Industry, and specifically helps Sanya print new fabrics. He is not only brave enough to criticize others, but also good at self-criticism. For example, after Sanya's first attempt to produce new fabrics failed, he reviewed his own mistakes, believing that Snachkovsky (the chief engineer) should not have been in charge of the experiment. But he was not discouraged by this, he continued to do it bravely. He is so humble and optimistic.
    Regarding this character, I firmly grasped the following characteristics:
    First, he deeply understands the needs of the people. Kulepin's argument with the female factory director Kabitilina in the first scene of the first act shows this characteristic.
    Kab: But what's the point of arguing about this? Kulepin! Our only purpose is to give the people more, cheaper, and more durable things, isn't it?
    Kul: Am I against that? The people are expecting durable and cheap fabrics, there is nothing to argue about at all.
    Kab: Thank goodness, you finally understand. What we want to report to Comrade Bashlykov is the work done to achieve this goal.
    Kul: No! What we want to report is not this, we want to report to him something more important, that is: the workers in the factory are not satisfied with the products they make with their own hands, they want to make colorful and beautiful fabrics, I can even say beautiful fabrics, beautiful fabrics like the dawn.
    Kulepin deeply understands the demands and needs of the people, and he struggles to meet the people's correct demands, so his struggle has a solid foundation and a clear goal.
    Second, he gives unlimited trust to the creative labor of the workers. If Kulepin only verbally opposed Kabitilina's conservative ideas, but lacked a deep understanding and sufficient trust in the creative labor of the masses, and therefore did not specifically and deeply lead the masses to carry out innovation and creation, then his "opposition" would have no practical significance. Let's look at his conversation with the female factory director:
    Kab: (Laughing) You're running to the clouds again, beautiful like the dawn, you're really as bad as Anyuda, you all seem to think that life in the factory is too boring, you should become singers or dancers.
    Kul: Anyuda is an artist when it comes to her work. Do you remember the ten-color printed fabric she printed? That's something that would make the great painters Repin and Surikov happy to see.
    This is not only Kulepin's view of Anyuda alone, but also his trust and praise for the labor and creation of the masses. For example, when Sanya's first trial production of printed fabric failed, the chief engineer rashly ordered the restoration of the original pattern, but Kulepin said to Sanya: "Restoring yesterday's, you can continue to think about tomorrow's!" "...Things are always a little uneasy at the beginning, but slowly they will calm down." He supported Sanya at all times, because "he likes all beautiful labor." Because of this, he can always move forward optimistically and confidently.
    Third, Kulepin's attitude towards comrades who make mistakes is very correct. His unwavering struggle with Kabitilina is aimed at helping her and saving her. Kulepin did not stand on Kabitilina's head to teach and accuse her, he valued this old Bolshevik very much, this strong and powerful factory director, this experienced textile expert. He wants to use all his enthusiasm and Bolshevik heart to help Kabitilina open her eyes and present the bright and splendid prospects and beautiful future in front of her. When Kabitilina's daughter Sanya expressed doubt about whether she could recognize her mistakes, Kulepin said to Sanya: "It doesn't matter, Sanya, she will admit her mistakes." Look, how much trust he has in Kabitilina's essence!
    Although I have understood Kulepin's characteristics in terms of reason, it is still very difficult to play this role well on the stage. First of all, I should thank the great ideological transformation movement. The Party helped me criticize my individualistic consciousness, which shortened the distance between me and Kulepin. Secondly, the director and other comrades constantly helped me get closer to this character in the rehearsal, which gradually deepened my understanding of the character. I also read Babayevsky's novel "Gold Star Hero" and "Light on the Earth," and watched several Soviet films. These works also helped me approach Kulepin. At the same time, my contact with certain leading comrades also gave me great inspiration. Many leading comrades work selflessly for the Party, care about the masses at all times, and have a very strong sense of principle and struggle. I have learned many valuable things from them.
    In the process of playing the role of Kulepin, I further understood the Party.
    We often say: the Communist Party is great, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no victory that cannot be achieved. But my understanding of this sentence is still very superficial. Through the creation of Kulepin's image, I realized that if Sanya left the Party, she would not have achieved victory; if Kabitilina left the Party, she would not have realized her mistakes; without the Party, the people would not be able to realize their beautiful wishes. If I did not have the Party's constant education, I would not have been able to complete this glorious task.
    In the past, I seemed to know in terms of reason that the final appraiser of works of art is the vast audience, but I did not deeply understand this in terms of emotion. This time I got the help of many dear viewers. Sanya once asked Kulepin: "If you were not a Party worker, what kind of work would you like to do?" Kulepin replied: "It's hard to say, one occupation is really too little for me, I love machines, I don't object to being a carpenter or a musician, I am also very willing to educate naughty children like Makarenko, I like all beautiful labor, so I do Party work." At first, I not only didn't understand this passage, but on the contrary, I found it boring, but during the first performance, this passage aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience, which really surprised me. Afterwards, I realized that the audience was not welcoming my performance, but welcoming Kulepin's kind and respectable thoughts. The audience is not only the appraiser, but also my best teacher. If there is any achievement in the creation of Kulepin's character, then it is inseparable from the education given to me by the vast audience. Many viewers pointed out that the character is not cheerful enough and is dull. I realized that this is related to my thoughts, feelings, and life experiences. I have not loved life and work as much as Kulepin.
    The Soviet Zamansky once said in "The Bolshevik Party Spirit in Actors' Creation": "The most valuable and touching thing in Soviet actors' creation - is the deep connection between actors and the people, and the consistency of actors' thoughts and interests with the people." I am willing to study hard and strive to improve myself. Like all my dear viewers, through the performance of "Dawn Over Moscow" and through the creation of Kulepin, I have learned an important lesson.

    我上了重要的一课
    ——对饰演“曙光照耀着莫斯科”中库烈聘这一角色的体会
    李默然
    当我们剧院决定排演“曙光照耀着莫斯科”这个剧本时，领导方面分配我饰演工厂党委书记库烈聘的任务。我太年轻，舞台经验不多，很难掌握剧中人物的思想感情，困难是很多的。库烈聘是在社会主义教育下培养起来的人物。在伟大的卫国战争中，他从事部队党的工作。他理解人民，懂得人民反对什么，追求什么。在导演严正同志的提示和启发下，我努力克服饰演这一角色的困难。
    库烈聘无时无刻不站在矛盾和斗争的前列，掌握并解决它们。他按照党的原则，乐观地、毫不动摇地带领着群众，向脱离群众的保守思想进行不倦的斗争，始终支持工人们的劳动创造。他不怕女厂长卡碧特丽娜的攻击，不怕纺织工业部代表巴施里柯夫的冷嘲，具体地帮助了桑妮亚印染新花布。他不仅敢于批评别人，而且善于自我批评，例如桑妮亚第一次试制新花布失败之后，他就检讨了自己的错误，认为不应该让司那奇柯夫斯基（总工程师）来主持这次试验。但他并不因此而气馁，他继续勇敢地做下去。他是那样虚心和乐观。
    对这个人物，我紧紧把握住如下几个特点：
    首先，他是深刻地了解人民需要的。库烈聘在第一幕第一场跟女厂长卡碧特丽娜的争论，就表现了这个特点。
    卡：可是这又有什么好争论的呢？库烈聘！我们唯一的目的是给人民更多更便宜更结实的东西，不是吗？
    库：难道我反对这一点吗？人民在期待着结实的廉价的布料，这根本没有什么要争论的。
    卡：谢天谢地，你总算明白过来了。我们要向巴施里柯夫同志报告的，就是为达到这个目的所做的工作。
    库：不！我们要报告的不是这个，我们要报告他更重要的那就是：厂里的工人不满意他们亲手制造的出品，他们要制造五彩的美丽的花布，我甚至可以说是漂亮的花布，漂亮的要像曙光一样的花布。
    库烈聘那样深切地了解人民的要求和需要，他为满足人民的正确要求而斗争，因此他的斗争便有了坚实的基础和明确的目标。
    其次，他对工人群众的创造性劳动给予无限的信任。假如库烈聘只在口头上反对卡碧特丽娜的保守思想，而对群众的创造性劳动缺乏深刻的理解和足够的信任，因而不具体地、深入地领导群众进行革新创造，那么他的“反对”就没有实际的意义。我们看看他跟女厂长的对话吧：
    卡：（大笑）你又跑到云彩上面去了，漂亮的像曙光一样，你真是安妞达一样的糟糕，你们好像都觉得厂里的生活太枯燥了，你们应当去做个歌唱家或是舞蹈家才对。
    库：安妞达对她的工作来说，是个艺术家。你记得她印出来的十色的印花布吗？那是能叫大画家列滨和苏利柯夫看了都高兴的。
    这不仅是库烈聘对安妞达一个人的看法，而是对群众劳动创造的信任和赞扬。又如桑妮亚第一次试制印花布失败时，总工程师轻率地命令恢复原来的花样，而库烈聘却对桑妮亚说：“恢复昨天的，还可以继续想着明天的呀！”“……事情开始的时候总是不大平静的，但慢慢地终归会平静下来的。”他时时刻刻支持着桑妮亚，因为“一切美丽的劳动他都喜欢”。正因为如此，他才能永远乐观地、满怀信心地前进。
    第三，库烈聘对待犯错误的同志的态度是非常正确的。他坚定不移地跟卡碧特丽娜斗争的目的是为了帮助她，挽救她。库烈聘并没有站在卡碧特丽娜头上进行教训和指责，他非常看重这位老布尔什维克，这位坚强有力的厂长、这位经验丰富的纺织专家。他要用自己的全部热情和布尔什维克的心，去帮助卡碧特丽娜睁开眼睛，把光辉灿烂的远景，美妙的前途呈献在她的面前。当卡碧特丽娜的女儿桑妮亚对她能否认识自己的错误，表示怀疑的时候，库烈聘对桑妮亚说：“不要紧的，桑妮亚，她会承认她的错误的。”你看，他对卡碧特丽娜的本质给予多么大的信任！
    我虽然在理性上认识了库烈聘的特点，但要在舞台上演好这个角色，仍然有很大的困难。首先我应当感谢伟大的思想改造运动，党帮助我批判了我的个人主义的意识，这使我和库烈聘之间的距离缩短了一些。其次导演和其他同志们在排演中不断帮助我靠近这个人物，使我对人物的理解逐渐加深。我又看了苏联巴巴耶夫斯基的小说“金星英雄”和“地上的光明”，还看了若干苏联电影。这些作品也帮助了我接近库烈聘。同时我跟某些领导同志的接触也给了我很大启发。许多领导同志忘我地为党工作，时时关心群众，原则性和斗争性非常强。我从他们身上吸取了许多宝贵的东西。
    在饰演库烈聘这一角色的过程中，我进一步地认识了党。
    我们经常讲：共产党伟大，在共产党的领导下，无往而不胜利。但我对这话的理解还很肤浅。通过库烈聘形象的创造，我认识到，假如桑妮亚离开了党，就不会获得胜利；卡碧特丽娜离开了党就不会认识到自己的错误；人民没有党，就无法实现自己美好愿望。我自己如果没有党的不断教育，就不会完成这次光荣任务。
    我过去在理性上好像也知道：艺术品的最后鉴定者是广大的观众，但在情感上却对此体会不深。这一次我得到了许多亲爱的观众的帮助。桑妮亚有一次问库烈聘：“如果你不是一个党的工作者，你喜欢做什么工作呢？”库烈聘回答说：“很难说，一种职业对我来说那实在是太少了，我爱机器、我也不反对做个木匠或者音乐家，我也很愿意像马卡伦柯一样去教育顽皮的孩子，一切美丽的劳动我都喜欢，所以我才做党的工作。”起初我对这一段话不仅没有理解，而相反地却觉得枯燥，但第一次演出时，这段话在观众中引起了热烈的掌声，这确实使我吃了一惊。过后我意识到，观众不是欢迎我的表演，而是欢迎库烈聘可亲可敬的思想。观众不仅是鉴定者，而且是我最好的老师。如果说，在库烈聘这一人物的创造上，还有一点成绩，那末这是与广大观众给我的教育分不开的。很多观众提出人物还不开朗、沉闷，我就意识到这是和我的思想情感、生活体验有关。我还没有像库烈聘那样热爱生活，热爱工作。
    苏联札曼斯基在“演员创造中的布尔什维克党性”中曾说过：“在苏联演员创造中，最有价值、最动人的地方——就是演员和人民的深切的联系，演员与人民思想志趣的一致。”我愿好好学习，努力提高自己。我和所有亲爱的观众们一样，通过“曙光照耀着莫斯科”的上演，通过库烈聘的创造，上了重要的一课。
