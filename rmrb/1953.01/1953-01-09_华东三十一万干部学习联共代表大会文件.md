In East China, cadres in provinces and cities and at the East China level have been studying the documents from the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union since the beginning of November last year, and this study is now being carried out in depth throughout the region.

More than 310,000 cadres above the special district level from government organs, factories, enterprises, and schools are participating in this study (including 1,790 senior cadres). This includes 46,570 people from East China-level organs, 54,514 people in Shandong Province, more than 45,000 people from county-level and above organs in Fujian Province, 34,280 people in Anhui Province, more than 60,070 people in Jiangsu Province, and more than 71,600 people in Shanghai. In addition, the general cadres of Zhejiang Province, excluding 130 senior cadres, have not yet been included in the statistics.

Currently, the study in various regions generally concluded the study of the part of Malenkov's report on the international situation around the end of November last year. From the beginning of December, it has moved into the study of the internal situation of the Soviet Union and the Party. In order to make the study more in-depth, Party organizations at all levels, after inspecting the study situation in the first stage, made further arrangements, requiring all study units to combine theory with practice and delve into the study in light of their business needs. During this period, senior cadres generally read and discussed the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Individual units have begun to study Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" as the main text, and combined it with relevant chapters of the CPSU Congress documents for further in-depth research. The study time is set for two months to two and a half months. To ensure the implementation of the above study, in addition to individual self-study time, a unified collective study time is generally stipulated, such as twice every Wednesday and Saturday, or half a day every Saturday. In addition, many regions and departments have also formulated study covenants.

In this study, the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the responsible comrades of the Party committees of various provinces and cities attached great importance to it. Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau, and Comrade Shu Tong, Minister of Propaganda, in addition to making study arrangements at the enlarged meeting of the East China Bureau, also organized the East China Bureau's study center group, and personally served as the group leader and deputy group leader. The main responsible comrades of various ministries and commissions and East China-level organs also served as the leaders of the study center groups or directors of the study committees of various departments, directly leading and controlling the cadre study. Party committees of various provinces and cities also successively established central study groups. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee was headed by Comrade Chen Pixian, Fourth Secretary, and Comrades Pan Hannian and Gu Mu, Deputy Secretaries; the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee was headed by Comrade Jiang Hua, Deputy Secretary, and Comrade Lin Hujia, Minister of Propaganda; the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee was headed by Comrades Ke Qingshi and Guan Wenwei, Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, and Comrade Shi Ximin, Minister of Propaganda; the joint conference of senior study group leaders in Fujian Province became the core of guiding the study of all cadres. At the same time, in order to better help the vast number of cadres to study in greater depth, the East China Bureau recently appointed 21 comrades to form a study advisory group, with Comrade Kuang Yaming, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, as the group leader, responsible for regular study guidance. In addition, lectures and radio lectures were widely used in various places, inviting responsible cadres to give lectures and make reports on answering study questions. For example, the East China-level organs and Shanghai jointly organized radio lectures, and also invited Comrade Feng Ding, Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the East China Bureau, to give an answer report on the study of the international situation part at a cadre conference of more than 13,000 people. Comrade Niu Shucai, Deputy Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, gave lectures to the cadres of directly affiliated organs, and also organized several responsible comrades to convey the spirit separately according to the four major systems of Party-masses, politics, culture and education, and finance and economics. Comrade Shi Ximin, Minister of Propaganda of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, made a mobilization report to the cadres of provincial-level organs; Comrade Jiang Hua, Deputy Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, also made a study report to the cadres of provincial-level organs. Due to the importance attached by Party committees at all levels, this study has become a more extensive and more organized political theory study.

In this study, it can be seen that there are several issues that deserve attention in guiding future studies: The first is the issue of linking theory with practice and linking it with business work. At the beginning of this study, leading cadres emphasized linking theory with practice and linking it with business work. Therefore, the study is closely combined with the activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month". Many units organized special reports on visiting the Soviet Union, and held discussions on the experiences of their units in learning from the Soviet Union, which greatly helped to understand the study of Soviet construction. In the study of documents, each unit consciously combined it with current work and determined the focus of study: for example, the East China Finance Committee, the East China Branch of the People's Bank, and other organs combined the "law of value" issue with the task of adjusting prices for study; the organization department specifically combined cadre work and discipline inspection work in the study of Party construction issues; and the propaganda department specifically combined ideological work for study. All departments paid attention to combining the examination of their own policies, ideas, and work style in their studies in order to further improve the policy and theoretical level of cadres and improve their work. However, on the other hand, there are also some deviations. Some abstractly debated current contradictions and neglected the current tasks of struggle when studying the international situation part; some units still cannot combine Soviet experience with their own work for study. Some trade organs believe that their current task is to adjust prices and criticize the idea of the supply system, which is not related to Malenkov's report. Some comrades also do not make specific analyses when checking their work in combination with their studies, and completely deny their work achievements. Another tendency is: linking theory with practice means abandoning documents, specializing in talking about one's own work, or turning study into ideological inspection. Therefore, how to correctly link theory with practice in study and make the study more in-depth still requires greater efforts from some units. Second, senior cadres often cannot persevere regularly in the past due to busy work. The experience of this study proves that if the following points are grasped, study can not only be persisted, but also be effective:
(1) Study is closely combined with business, so that the study achieves the due effect. (2) The main responsible cadres personally serve as the leaders of the study group and lead the study. (3) Establish the necessary systems (such as the half-day collective study system) and strictly implement them. (4) Strengthen the responsibility of senior cadres to guide the study of general cadres, so that cadres up and down promote each other's study. In the future, we should continue to consolidate and improve the study of senior cadres from these aspects. Third, county and district general cadres mainly rely on listening to several popular reports to study the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and cannot require too much to delve into the documents. For example, Shandong made reports on studying the documents of the CPSU Congress at the provincial propaganda work conference to the propaganda ministers of the prefecture and county party committees, and then they went back to convey and organize the study. Anhui's use of radio lectures is an effective method. In addition, some organs have experienced slackness in learning due to the year-end summary work and the development of labor competitions, which is worthy of attention. Leading cadres must plan their time, and must not allow the study to be interrupted. It would be better if the study could be combined with the labor competition. For example, the commercial organs of Anhui Province listed study as one of the contents of the labor competition, and used this to promote study, which is a better experience.

    华东三十一万干部学习联共代表大会文件
    华东区各省、市及华东一级机关干部，在去年十一月初开始学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会各项文件，现学习正在全区范围内深入开展中。
    这次参加学习的，专区一级以上的机关干部和工厂、企业、学校的工作干部，约在三十一万人以上
    （包括高级干部一千七百九十人）。华东一级机关四万六千五百七十人，山东全省五万四千五百十四人，福建全省县以上机关四万五千余人，安徽全省三万四千二百八十人，江苏全省六万零七十余人，上海市七万一千六百余人。此外，浙江省除高级干部一百三十余人外，一般干部尚未统计在内。
    目前各地的学习，一般在去年十一月底前后就结束了马林科夫报告关于国际形势部分的学习。从十二月初开始转入苏联内部情况和党的部分的学习。为了使学习更深入一步，各级党的组织在检查了第一阶段学习情况后，接着作了进一步的布置，要求各学习单位联系实际结合业务需要，深入钻研。这一时期，高级干部对苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件，一般也都进行了阅读和讨论，个别单位已开始转入以斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”为主的学习，并结合联共代表大会文件的有关章节作进一步深入研究，学习时间订为两个月到两个半月。为保证上述学习的贯彻，除个别自学的时间外，一般均规定了统一的集体学习时间，如有的是每星期三、六两次，有的是每星期六的半天。此外并有不少地区与部门订出了学习公约。
    在这一次学习中，中共中央华东局及各省市党的负责同志都很重视，华东局第三书记谭震林同志、宣传部长舒同同志除在华东局扩大会议上作了学习布置以外，并组织了华东局的学习中心组，亲任正副组长。各部委及华东一级机关主要负责同志亦都担任了各部门的学习中心组长或学委会主任，直接领导与掌握干部学习。各省、市党委也先后成立了中心学习组。如上海市委由第四书记陈丕显同志及副书记潘汉年、谷牧等同志分任正副组长；浙江省委由副书记江华同志及宣传部长林乎加同志担任正副组长；江苏省委由正副书记柯庆施、管文蔚同志及宣传部长石西民同志任正副组长；福建省的学习高级组组长联席会成为指导全体干部学习的核心。同时为了更好地帮助广大干部学习深入一步，最近华东局指定了二十一位同志组成学习顾问组，以宣传部副部长匡亚明同志为组长，负责经常的学习指导工作。此外，各地还广泛地采用了演讲会、广播讲座等方式，请负责干部讲课和做学习问题的解答报告，如华东一级机关与上海市统一举办了广播讲座，并又请华东局宣传部副部长冯定同志在一万三千余干部大会上作了关于国际形势部分学习的解答报告。安徽省委副书记牛树才同志给直属机关干部讲课，并又组织了几位负责同志按党群、政治、文教、财经四大系统分别进行传达。江苏省委宣传部长石西民同志向省级机关干部作了动员报告；浙江省委副书记江华同志亦向省级机关干部作了学习报告。由于各级党委的重视，使得这次学习成为更广泛更有组织的一次政治理论学习。
    在这次学习中可以看出：有几个问题在今后指导学习中是值得注意的：首先是联系实际、联系业务工作的问题。在这次学习开始时，领导干部便强调了联系实际、联系业务工作。因此，学习与“中苏友好月”的活动是密切结合的。许多单位组织了参观苏联的专题报告，座谈了本单位学习苏联的经验，因而大大有助于认识苏联建设的学习。在文件学习中，各单位又有意识地结合当前工作，分别确定了学习重点：如华东财委、人民银行华东区行等机关将“价值法则”问题与调整物价的任务结合学习；组织部门在党的建设问题中特别联系干部工作、纪律检查工作进行学习；宣传部门特别联系思想工作进行学习。各部门在学习中都注意结合检查自己的政策思想与工作作风，以求进一步提高干部政策理论水平和改进工作。但在另一方面，也存在着一些偏向，有的在学习国际形势部分时，抽象争论当前矛盾而忽视了目前的斗争任务；有些单位还不能将苏联经验与自己的工作结合起来进行学习，某些贸易机关认为自己的当前任务是调整物价和批判供给制思想，与马林科夫报告联系不上。也有些同志在结合学习检查工作时，不加具体分析，将自己的工作成就完全否定了。另一种倾向表现在：联系实际，便丢开文件，专门去讲自己的工作，或使学习变成为思想检查。因此，如何在学习中正确地联系实际，使学习更深入一步，有些单位还待更大的努力。其次，高级干部的学习过去常因工作较忙，而不能经常坚持。这次学习的经验证明：如果掌握住下面几点，学习不但可以坚持，而且行之有效：
    （一）学习密切结合业务，使学习获得应有的效果。（二）主要负责干部亲自担任学习组长，领导学习。（三）建立必要的制度（如半日集体学习制），并严格的执行。（四）加强高级干部指导一般干部学习的责任，使上下干部互相推动学习。今后仍应从这几个方面去巩固与提高高级干部的学习。第三、县、区一般干部学习苏联共产党十九次代表大会文件，主要靠听几次通俗的报告，不能要求太多的去钻研文件，如山东在全省宣传工作会议上向地、县委宣传部长做学习联共代表大会文件的报告，然后由他们回去传达和组织学习。安徽利用广播讲解，都是有效的方法。此外，某些机关，曾因为年关总结工作与开展劳动竞赛，学习有松懈现象，这是值得注意的。领导干部必须有计划地支配时间，绝不能使学习中断，若能使学习与劳动竞赛结合起来就会更好。如安徽省的商业机关将学习列为劳动竞赛的内容之一，借此来推动学习，就是较好的经验。
