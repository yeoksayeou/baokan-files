Should Look Further Ahead
—Agricultural Labor Model Chen Shuangtian Talks About National Industrialization and Democratic System
Zhang Ruohuang

Chen Shuangtian, a Zhejiang agricultural labor model, recently participated in the first session of the Second Zhejiang Provincial People's Representative Conference and elected the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the provincial people's government. This event gave him a deep impression: He associated it with everything he saw in the Soviet Union when he participated in the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to the Soviet Union, and further realized that national industrialization and the democratic system are inseparable.

He said: Organizing is the "inevitable path from poverty to prosperity." He understood this truth somewhat before going to the Soviet Union, and had already started on this path. In 1950, he organized a mutual aid team, and in March 1952, he upgraded the mutual aid team to an agricultural production cooperative; he saw the benefits of organizing with his own eyes. But after visiting the Soviet Union, he realized even more profoundly that farmers can only carry out large-scale production with machines by organizing, and can only achieve a thorough turnaround. There is no other way. He said, "In the collective farms of the Soviet Union, I only saw machines running. Not only is everything from plowing to harvesting done with machines, but also planting trees and picking cotton are done with machines, and even airplanes are used for fertilization. Think about it, individual farmers not only can't afford so many machines, but they also wouldn't know how to use them even if they were given to them. Our land is like tofu, small pieces here and there, and the tractor can't turn around, and the combine harvester can't even be placed properly!" Originally, he thought that organizing an agricultural production cooperative was not bad; but compared with the collective farms of the Soviet Union, he realized that he was far behind. Currently, he is preparing to further expand and consolidate the agricultural production cooperative, so that it can move forward another step when conditions are ripe.

He had heard people say before that there would be no farmers in the future, only agricultural workers; at the time, he couldn't quite understand it. He thought: No matter what society it is, the rice for eating is always grown by farmers, so how can there be no farmers? Everything he saw in the Soviet Union solved this problem. He said, "In the collective farms of the Soviet Union, almost every job is inseparable from machines, and everything is inseparable from electricity. Shearing sheep and milking cows are the kinds of jobs that we always think can only be done by hand, but in the Soviet Union they are also done by machines. We can't know when it will be sunny or rainy, but in the Soviet Union, every collective farm has weather forecasting instruments. All kinds of farming machines have several wheels and several discs. Do you think you can push them without technology? Although these people are producing food, they are actually workers operating machines." From here, he further realized the importance of the worker-peasant alliance, not only that farmers produce raw materials for workers and workers manufacture machines for farmers, but more importantly: Under the leadership of the worker elder brothers, with the development of agricultural mechanization, farmers will also become agricultural workers who can master machines in the future. In the Soviet Union, Chen Shuangtian personally saw that the reason why the Soviet people have what they have today is inseparable from the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government.

Before Chen Shuangtian went to the Soviet Union, he thought: Now that the enemies have been defeated, the land has returned home, and there is no need to worry about food and clothing, it doesn't matter if the leadership of production and construction is relaxed a little in the future. But the facts in the Soviet Union told him: The more construction there is, the more leadership from the Party and the People's Government is needed. He talked about such a thing: "When we first organized the agricultural production cooperative, someone asked where the machines would come from in the future? At that time, everyone said without hesitation: We have 4% of the public accumulation fund. After accumulating for a few years, our cooperative can buy a tractor and use machines to produce like the Soviet Union. Now that I think about it, this statement is really funny. The large machines for cultivating in the Soviet collective farms all belong to the state machine stations. Relying on our own public accumulation fund can only solve part of the difficulties at most. We should look further ahead. Only when the entire country is industrialized can the problem of collective farms using large machines for cultivation be fundamentally solved."

Recently, he participated in the first session of the Second Zhejiang Provincial People's Representative Conference. He believes that this meeting is of great significance. He said, "When we visited the 'Communist Lighthouse' collective farm in the Soviet Union, I asked them: Why do you have such good results? They replied: The biggest guarantee for achieving results is the democratic system. The chairman of their farm is elected by all the members, so the person elected is the most able to work for the whole farm. Because their farm has always had a good chairman leading it, it has guaranteed the continuous development of the farm's cause and the continuous improvement of production. We are the same. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and our own People's Government, we will definitely be able to complete our new construction tasks!"

    应该把眼光放远点
    ——农业劳动模范陈双田谈国家工业化和民主制度
    张若煌
    浙江农业劳动模范陈双田最近参加了浙江省第二届第一次各界人民代表会议，选举了省人民政府的主席、副主席和委员。这件事给予他深刻的印象：他联想到参加中国农民访苏代表团时在苏联看到的一切，进一步认识到国家工业化和民主制度是分不开的。
    他说：组织起来是“由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”，这个真理在未去苏联之前是有些懂得的，并且早在开始走这条路。一九五○年组织了互助组，一九五二年三月里又把互助组提高为农业生产合作社；组织起来的好处是亲眼看到了。但是到苏联参观以后，才更深刻地认识到：农民只有组织起来才能用机器进行大生产，才能得到彻底翻身，除此以外没有别的道路。他说：“在苏联的集体农庄里只看见机器在奔跑，不但从耕种到收割都用机器，就是种树、采棉花也都用机器，并且还用飞机施肥。你想，这么多的机器，单干的农民不但买不了，就是送给他也没法用。像我们现在这样豆腐干一样一小块一小块的田地，拖拉机掉不过屁股，康拜因机连摆也不好摆！”本来他以为已经组织了农业生产合作社，也不错了；但和苏联的集体农庄一比，才知道自己还差得远。目前，他正在准备把农业生产合作社更加扩充和巩固起来，以便在条件成熟时再向前发展一步。
    以前他曾经听到人家说：将来就没有农民了，只有农业工人；当时有些想不通。他想：不管进到什么社会，吃饭的米总是农民种出来的，怎么会没有农民呢？在苏联看到的一切，把这个问题解决了。他说：“在苏联的集体农庄里几乎样样工作离不了机器，样样离不了电。剪羊毛、挤牛奶这一类工作，照我们想总是非用手不行，但是在苏联也是用机器的。天晴天雨我们没法知道，但在苏联每一个集体农庄里都有预测气象的仪器。各种耕作的机器都是几个轮子几个盘，你说没有技术推得动吗？这些人虽然在生产粮食，其实都是开动机器的工人。”从这里，他就更进一步认识到工农联盟的重要性，不单是农民生产原料供给工人、工人制造机器供给农民，更重要的是：农民在工人老大哥的领导之下，随着农业机械化的发展，将来也要成为能够掌握机器的农业工人。在苏联，陈双田亲眼看到苏联人民所以会有今天，是和苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导分不开的。
    陈双田在没有去苏联以前，曾经想：现在敌人打倒了，土地回家了，吃饭穿衣不用发愁了，以后对生产建设的领导放松一点也没关系了。但是苏联的事实告诉我：越是在大建设的时候，越需要党和人民政府的领导。他谈起这样一件事：“当我们刚组织农业生产合作社的时候，有人问起以后机器从什么地方来？当时大家毫不犹豫地说：我们有百分之四的公积金，积上几年，我们合作社就可以买一部拖拉机，像苏联一样用机器生产了。现在想想这种说法真好笑。在苏联集体农庄里耕作的大机器都是属于国家机器站的，靠自己的公积金最多只能解决一部分困难。应该把眼光放得远些。只有整个国家工业化了，才能根本解决集体农庄用大机器耕作的问题。”
    最近他参加了浙江省第二届第一次各界人民代表会议。他认为这次会议意义十分重大。他说：“我们参观苏联‘共产主义灯塔’集体农庄时，我曾经问过他们：为什么有这么好的成绩。他们回答说：获得成绩的最大保证是民主制度。他们农庄的主席是由全体庄员选举的，因此选出来的人就是最能够为全庄办事的人。正因为他们农庄一直有着好的主席在领导，所以才保证了农庄里的事业不断发展，生产不断提高。我们也是一样，在毛主席、共产党和我们人民自己的政府的领导下，我们一定能够完成我们的新的建设任务！”
