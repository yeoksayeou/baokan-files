Industrial and mining enterprises should vigorously lead the technical education of employees
The fact that the leadership of industrial and mining enterprises in Anshan and Fushun are using great efforts to cultivate technical cadres and conducting large-scale technical education for on-the-job employees is completely correct and in line with the current objective needs.

Large-scale economic construction has already begun. The lack of technical employees has become one of the most important problems that must be solved on the road to China's industrial development. Many factories and mines not only need to increase technical personnel to meet the needs of production development, but also need to transfer a large number of technical employees to basic construction, and in the future, they must also prepare to transfer personnel to support the establishment of new industrial centers. If we cannot solve the task of cultivating technical employees in a timely manner, it will inevitably reduce the speed of industrial development; and this is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, we must make the greatest possible efforts to cultivate technical personnel earnestly and in large quantities.

The state is already holding various industrial schools on a large scale, which is the main method of cultivating technical cadres. However, we should never rely solely on this method. The experience of Anshan and Fushun proves that industrial centers like them have huge potential to cultivate technical employees. Because many engineers and technicians concentrated here can be hired as teachers, and the actual production process and various equipment provide the best conditions for practice. As long as we are good at developing this potential, we can, like Anshan and Fushun, enable thousands of on-the-job employees to improve their technical capabilities through various means and take on the task of technicians. Conversely, if we neglect or discard this potential without fully developing it, it would be a huge loss.

Although the technical education work in Anshan and Fushun has not been established for long, the experience is not yet complete, and there are many difficult problems that have not yet been resolved; however, their work has achieved many results and has been welcomed by the majority of employees. What is particularly important is that their experience has initially proved that it is entirely possible for factories and mining enterprises to cultivate new technical cadres and improve the technical level of on-the-job employees on a large scale through technical schools and other various methods. Their approach has provided us with an important and auxiliary method of cultivating technical forces.

In their experience, the following three points are worth noting:

First, the leadership's determination is the prerequisite for doing this work well. Due to the heavy production and construction tasks, the leaders of many enterprises often easily regard the cultivation of reserve forces and the improvement of the technical level of on-the-job employees as insignificant matters, or even as an extra burden. They emphasize that they cannot spare the strength, but in reality, this is often just a manifestation of being afraid of trouble and wanting to rely on higher authorities to transfer people. Therefore, we must constantly explain to all enterprise leaders the great significance of developing potential, strengthening the cultivation of technical reserve forces, and improving the technical level of on-the-job employees, and criticize all kinds of ideas that only care about the present and are afraid of trouble. Only when the leadership's thinking is straightened out can the difficulties of teachers, equipment, funding and other difficulties be solved smoothly.

Second, this work should be carried out in a planned manner and on a larger scale. At present, various employees are very eager to improve their skills. Leading cadres should, according to the urgent needs of the enterprise and the long-term needs of the enterprise's future development, grasp the key points and carry out technical education in a prepared and planned manner in order to achieve the greatest results and avoid the shortcomings of blindly grasping. This work should be carried out on a larger scale, not only because the majority of employees have a high enthusiasm for learning technology, but also because the scale and tasks of our national industrialization are very huge.

Third, specialized institutions should be established to manage this work. The management of technical education is a complex and heavy organizational task. In today's industrial and mining enterprises, whether it is a cadre who has just started working in the industrial and mining post, a new or old technician who has a certain amount of production experience and cultural level, or a new worker who has just come from the countryside, they all have different learning requirements; moreover, the content of industrial technology is also diverse, so the methods and content of education must be diverse, and the duration of learning must be different. In order to do a good job in the management of technical education, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has specially established an education department and equipped it with a certain number of cadres, which is absolutely necessary.

The experience of Anshan and Fushun is also applicable to other industrial and mining enterprises. Although the conditions of each industrial and mining enterprise are different, the task of cultivating technical forces is the same. In order to meet the future of national industrialization, all enterprises should vigorously complete the huge task of cultivating technical cadres.

### 工矿企业应大力领导员工的技术教育工作

    工矿企业应大力领导员工的技术教育工作
    鞍山和抚顺的工矿领导方面用大力培养技术干部，大规模进行在职员工技术教育，是完全正确的，符合当前客观需要的。
    大规模的经济建设已经开始。技术员工缺少已经成为我国工业发展道路上必须解决的最重要的问题之一。许多厂矿不仅要增加技术人员以满足发展生产的需要，还要大量抽调技术员工到基本建设方面去，将来还要准备抽调人员去支援建立新的工业中心。如果我们不能及时解决培养技术员工的任务，就必然会降低工业发展的速度；而这是绝对不可以的。因此，必须尽可能以最大的努力来认真地、大量地培养技术人材。
    国家已在大规模举办各种工业学校，这是培养技术干部的主要方法。但是，决不应该只依靠这一种方法。鞍山和抚顺的经验证明，像它们这样的工业中心，具备有培养技术员工的巨大潜力。因为，集中在这里的许多工程师、技术员可以被聘请为教员，而实际的生产过程和各种设备又为实习提供了最好的条件。我们只要善于发挥这种潜力，就可以像鞍山、抚顺那样，使成千成万的在职员工通过各种方式提高自己的技术能力，担任起技术员的任务。反之，如果忽视或弃置这种潜力而不使它充分发挥起来，那就是巨大的损失。
    鞍山和抚顺的技术教育工作，虽然建立还不久，经验还不完整，有许多困难问题尚未获得解决；但是，他们的工作已获得许多成绩，并受到广大员工的欢迎。特别重要的是他们的经验已经初步证明：由厂矿企业采取技术学校和其它各种方式大规模地培养新的技术干部和提高在职员工的技术水平，是完全可能的。他们的作法，已经给我们提供了培养技术力量的一种重要的、辅助的方法。
    在他们的经验中，以下三点是值得重视的：
    首先，领导上的决心是做好这一工作的前提。由于生产和建设任务的繁重，许多企业的领导者往往容易把培养后备力量和提高在职员工的技术水平，看成不关痛痒的事情，甚至是额外的负担。他们强调抽不出力量，而实际上，这往往只是怕麻烦和想依靠上级调人的表现。因此，必须不断地向一切企业领导人说明发挥潜力加强培养技术后备力量、提高在职员工技术水平的重大意义，批判各种只顾目前和怕麻烦的思想。只有领导思想打通了，教员、设备、经费和其它的困难才能顺利解决。
    其次，应该有计划地、并在较大的规模上进行这项工作。目前各种员工对提高技术的要求都是很迫切的，领导干部应根据企业的迫切需要和今后企业发展的长远需要，抓住重点，有准备、有计划地进行技术教育，才能收到最大效果并避免盲目乱抓的缺点。这一工作之所以应该在较大的规模上进行，不仅因为广大员工要求学习技术的热情很高，而且因为我们的国家工业化的规模和任务都是十分巨大的。
    第三，应该设立专业机构来管理这项工作。技术教育的管理，是一件复杂繁重的组织工作。在今天的工矿企业中，不论是刚走上工矿岗位的干部，已具备一定生产经验和文化水平的新老技工，或是刚从农村来的新的工人，都有不同的学习要求；而且，工业技术的内容也是多种多样的，因此，进行教育的方式和内容必须是多种多样的，学习的期限必须是长短参差的。为了把技术教育的管理工作做好，鞍山钢铁公司专门设立了教育处，配备了一定数量的干部，这是完全必要的。
    鞍山和抚顺的经验，对于其它的工矿企业也是适用的。各个工矿企业尽管条件不同，而培养技术力量的任务则是共同的。为了迎接国家工业化的前途，一切企业都应该大力完成培养技术干部的巨大工作。
