    Beijing Holds Construction Workers' Congress
    Mayor Peng Zhen Attends and Directs the Efforts of All Workers
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Construction Workers' Union convened a construction workers' congress on January 30th. Attending were cadres and workers, totaling more than 2,400 people, from 17 construction engineering units including the Beijing Construction Company, the Central Government Directly Subordinate Engineering Company, and the North China Directly Subordinate First Engineering Company. The congress was presided over by Li Yu, Chairman of the Beijing Construction Workers' Union. Mayor Peng Zhen and Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, attended and delivered speeches. In their speeches, Mayor Peng and Deputy Chairman Liu provided a detailed analysis of the chaotic phenomena that existed in some construction engineering units in Beijing in the past and pointed out the direction for the future efforts of all cadres and workers in the various construction units. Everyone in attendance was greatly educated and encouraged.
    In his speech, Mayor Peng Zhen first congratulated the construction workers for successfully completing the national tasks of the past year and for making contributions on the national construction front. He also expressed his gratitude for the opinions and suggestions that the construction workers had put forward to the government in order to overcome the chaotic phenomena in the various construction units and improve their work. When Mayor Peng pointed out the reasons for the recent chaotic phenomena in the various construction units, he said that the first reason was that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government had a bureaucratic work style in their leadership and had not managed the work of the various construction units well, and that the various construction units did not have unified leadership. The second reason was that the leading cadres of some construction units had serious shortcomings and mistakes in their work. They did not understand the work situation, did not understand the living conditions of the workers, and did not correctly handle the opinions put forward by the workers. For example, some things that should have been done and could have been done were not done, such as the method of calculating wages. Some things that could not be done now but could only be done after work started were not clearly explained to the worker comrades. Such as the issue of wage assessment, it should have been told to the worker comrades long ago that technical standards must be agreed upon first, and wage assessment can only be done after work starts, etc. There are also some things that can be done this way now, but must be changed in the future. Such as extending the holiday to go home for the Spring Festival in addition to the three days of statutory holidays. He pointed out that at present, we cannot carry out construction in winter, and construction workers usually have one day off every two weeks, and some workers' families are still in the south. Under these circumstances, it is permissible to allow workers to extend their holidays to go home in accordance with the contract or agreement. However, it should be made clear that this kind of holiday cannot be regarded as a permanent system, because according to the regulations of the Government Administration Council, the statutory holiday for the Spring Festival is three days, and doing so is reasonable. At the same time, for the sake of the workers' health, it is better to have one day off a week. There are also some things that the workers have asked to be done that are simply impossible to do, and our cadres have not clearly explained why they cannot be done, and even made promises indiscriminately about things that cannot be done, which is wrong. Therefore, he said, the occurrence of these chaotic phenomena is primarily the fault of the municipal leadership, and secondarily the fault of the leadership of some engineering units, and the worker comrades should not be blamed. However, there are also a very small number of workers whose actions are incorrect, such as beating people, molesting women, and even wanting to beat people's police and cadres. He asked: Do you all think this kind of behavior is right? The audience answered in unison: "No!" Mayor Peng said, everyone must never do this again in the future.
    Speaking about the issue of workers raising opinions, he said: There are many workers who are highly skilled and do a good job, and who raise many opinions on the shortcomings in the work. Such workers are good workers and should be welcomed, such as Comrade Lu Wenbin. Some workers usually do a very bad job, and it is said that some people only lay two bricks a day, and they just make trouble and create a ruckus. He asked: Are such workers good? The audience answered loudly: "No!" Mayor Peng said that such workers should correct their mistakes. He went on to point out that some cadres do not understand technology and do not study hard, and not only do they not accept the opinions put forward by the worker comrades, but they also dislike them, which is not allowed. These cadres should make self-criticisms to the masses and correct their mistakes, otherwise they will only be dismissed. Mayor Peng Zhen earnestly hoped that everyone would try their best to raise any opinions on work and treatment before going home for the Spring Festival, so that the leadership of each unit can study them during the holidays and prepare to deal with them after work starts.
    The various engineering units are currently discussing technical standards. Mayor Peng pointed out that this work must be done well. If technical standards are agreed upon, it will be easier to assess wages after work starts.
    Regarding the issue of strengthening the backbone of the construction industry, Mayor Peng said: All construction engineering units should select a group of workers with technology, experience, and a correct work style to be promoted to cadres. Only when the original veteran cadres and technical experts are combined with these worker cadres can the work be done well.
    Mayor Peng Zhen finally said: The state's large-scale economic construction has begun, and the glorious task of basic construction falls on our construction workers. We must rectify our construction workers' ranks and make the capital's construction workers an excellent team, so that we can undertake the great task of building the capital.
    The workers and cadres who attended the meeting were very excited after listening to the speech. Seven worker representatives from the Civil Engineering and Construction Company of the North China Electric Power Administration all guaranteed that they would bring the spirit of the congress back to the construction site. Zhai Jianzhang, a bricklayer from the Third Brigade, said: "I will definitely come back early from the holiday and study hard to ensure the completion of the 1953 task." Li Rui, a worker from the Fifth Construction Site of the Second Engineering Department of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry, said: "I am convinced by what Mayor Peng said, and we will help the leadership in the future and do a good job in completing the construction tasks." Gao Fenglai, from the Third Class of the Winter Training Class of the First Engineering Department of the Beijing Construction Company, took notes non-stop from the beginning of the meeting to the end of Mayor Peng's speech. After listening to Mayor Peng's report, he said excitedly: "The government takes such good care of us that they have thought of problems that we ourselves have not even thought of." The Second Group of the Second Class used to be an advanced bricklaying group. In the past, due to improper work of cadre transfers, the workers' morale was somewhat low. After listening to Mayor Peng's report, they all unanimously stated: If we have any opinions on our work in the future, we must raise them more often and never affect our work. Sun Derong, a worker from the Winter Training Class of the First Engineering Department of the Beijing Construction Company, kept urging the literate workers next to him to take notes while listening to the speech. He said: "Mayor Peng really understands the workers! What he said today is exactly what we workers have in mind, and he has spoken out what we have wanted to say for a long time. I am really happy in my heart." He excitedly told others that after he brings his family to Beijing from the south this time, he will live in Beijing forever and will devote all his energy to building the great capital.

    北京市召开建筑工人大会
    彭真市长到会指示全体工人的努力方向
    【本报讯】一月三十日，北京市建筑工会召开建筑工人大会。到会的有北京市建筑公司、中央直属工程公司、华北直属第一工程公司等十七个建筑工程单位的干部和工人，共两千四百多人。大会由北京市建筑工会主席李育主持。彭真市长和中共北京市委副书记、市总工会副主席刘仁都出席讲了话。彭市长和刘副主席在讲话中，对于过去一个时期北京市某些建筑工程单位所存在的混乱现象，作了详尽的分析，并且指出了各建筑单位的全体干部和工人今后努力的方向。每个到会的人都受到极大的教育和鼓舞。
    彭真市长在讲话中，首先祝贺建筑工人胜利地完成了去年的国家任务，在国家建设战线上立了功；并对建筑工人为了克服各建筑单位混乱现象和改进工作向政府提出的意见，表示感谢。彭市长指出最近各建筑单位发生混乱现象的原因时说，头一个原因是中共北京市委和市人民政府在领导上存在官僚主义作风，对各建筑单位的工作没有很好地管，各建筑单位没有统一的领导。其次是有些建筑单位的领导干部在工作中有严重的缺点和错误，他们不了解工作情况，不了解工人的生活情况，不正确地处理工人提出的意见。例如，有的事情应该办也可能办的没有办，如工资的计算方法问题。有些事情现在不能办，开工后才能办的，也没有好好向工人同志们解释清楚。如评定工资的问题，早就应该告诉工人同志们必须先商定技术标准，等开工后才能评定等。还有些问题现在可以这样做，将来一定要改的。如春节时除三天例假外，还要延长假期回家过年等。他指出：目前冬天我们还不能施工，建筑工人平日又是两星期休息一天，有些工人家属还在南方。在这种情形下，按照合同或约定允许工人延长假期回家，是可以的。但是应该说清楚，不能把这种假期作为永久的制度，因为按照政务院规定，春节的例假是三天，这样做才是合理的。同时为了工人的健康，平日还是一星期休息一天好。还有些工人要求办的事情是根本办不到的，我们的干部也没有明确解释清楚为什么办不到，甚至对不可能办的事情也乱许愿，这都是不对的。因此，他说，发生这些混乱现象，第一是怨市的领导，第二是怨有些工程单位的领导，不能怨工人同志们。但也有很少数工人的行动是不对的，如打人、调戏妇女、甚至要打人民警察和干部等。他问：大家说这种行为对不对呢？会场同声回答说：“不对！”彭市长说，以后大家决不要这样做了。
    谈到工人提意见的问题，他说：有很多工人技术高、工作好，对工作中的缺点提意见很多，这样的工人是好工人，应该欢迎，例如陆文斌同志。有的工人平日工作很坏，据说有的人一天只砌两块砖，就是会捣乱起哄。他问：这样工人好不好呢？全场高声回答：“不好！”彭市长说，这样的工人应该好好改正错误。他接着指出：有些干部不懂技术又不好好学习，对工人同志们提的意见不但不接受反而讨厌，这是不许可的。这些干部应该向群众进行检讨、改正错误，否则只有撤职。彭真市长殷切地希望大家在回家过春节以前，如果对工作和待遇等有意见尽量提出来，好使各单位领导方面在假期中加以研究，准备开工后处理。
    各工程单位目前正在讨论技术标准，彭市长指出：这个工作一定要搞好，技术标准商订好，开工后才好评定工资。
    关于加强建筑业的骨干力量问题，彭市长说：各建筑工程单位应该选择一批有技术的、有经验的、作风正派的工人提拔为干部。原来的老干部和技术专家只有和这些工人干部相结合，才能把工作做好。
    彭真市长最后说：国家大规模经济建设开始了，基本建设的光荣任务落在我们建筑工人身上，我们一定要把我们建筑工人的队伍整顿好，使首都建筑工人成为一支优秀的队伍，才能担负起伟大的首都的建设任务。
    到会的工人、干部听了讲话以后，都非常兴奋。华北电业管理局土木建筑公司的七个工人代表，都保证要把大会的精神带回工地去。第三大队瓦工翟建章说：“我一定在假期提前回来，好好学习，保证完成一九五三年的任务。”中央第二机械工业部第二工程处第五工地工人李锐说：“彭市长说的我心服口服，以后我们要帮助领导，好好完成建设任务。”北京市建筑公司第一工程处冬训班第三班高凤来从开会到彭市长讲完话，一直手不停笔地记笔记。听完彭市长的报告后，他兴奋地说：“政府照顾我们太周到了，连我们自己没想到的问题都给我们想到了。”二班二组原是瓦工先进小组，从前由于干部调动工作不当，工人情绪有些低落，听了彭市长报告以后，都一致表示：以后对工作有意见，一定多提，绝不影响工作。北京市建筑公司第一工程处冬训班工人孙德荣在听讲话时，连连督促身旁会写字的工人记笔记。他说：“彭市长真了解工人呵！他今天说的话，正对我们工人的心眼，替我们说出了早就想说的话。我心里真是痛快得不得了。”他兴奋地告诉别人，他这次回到南方把家眷接到北京来以后，就永远住在北京了，一定要用自己全副精力来建设伟大的首都。
