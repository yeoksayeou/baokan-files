    China Coal Construction Company Beijing Branch
    Fails to Execute Timber Supply Agreement

    To the Editor: The large-scale national basic construction will begin in 1953. It is very important to properly classify timber and supply timber that meets specifications and quality in a timely manner. However, the supply work of the Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company last year was unsatisfactory. The company failed to execute the timber supply agreement, thereby damaging the quality of the project, delaying the progress of the project, and causing undue losses to the country's basic construction. Therefore, I would like to bring it to their attention.

    Our company's Second Engineering Office purchased over 110 cubic meters of first-class miscellaneous wood rafters and over 200 cubic meters of red and white pine scaffolding boards from the Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company last year. Thirty percent of them were so rotten that they would break at the slightest touch. Under the urgent need for materials, we had to use the poor-quality timber reluctantly, and those that were really unusable were treated as firewood. The Fifth Engineering Office bought 60 cubic meters of third-class red and white pine thin boards from the company, intending to use them for building materials. Later, because this batch of thin boards completely failed to meet the specifications, we had to convert the better 60 percent into shed sheathing, and the remaining 40 percent was treated as waste. The Sixth Engineering Office purchased a total of 388.423 cubic meters of red and white pine squared timber from the company, of which 60 percent of the third-class pine timber used for sawing sheathing at the Yuanmingyuan construction site did not meet the specifications. Our company purchased 38,000 fir poles and 1,300 cubic meters of scaffolding boards from the company, and both parties signed an agreement. However, when the goods were delivered, it was found that many scaffolding boards had ant nests and wormholes, and 20 percent were unusable. We lost over 300 million yuan on this batch of scaffolding boards alone. The fir poles we needed should be 10 meters long and 5 centimeters in diameter, but the company sold us fir logs of 10 meters long and 8-9 centimeters in diameter instead of fir poles. This was inconvenient to use, and this batch of fir timber wasted us a total of 240 million yuan. Due to the poor quality of the scaffolding boards, incidents of scaffolding boards breaking and workers being injured occurred at the Huimin College and the No. 13 District Primary School construction sites.

    In summary, in the past year alone, according to the statistics of the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Engineering Offices of the Beijing Construction Company, the amount of timber purchased from the Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company that did not meet quality specifications reached over 700 cubic meters, with losses of around 800 million yuan. The damage suffered by the construction projects is incalculable. In order to complete the great construction tasks of the motherland this year, the company should quickly and thoroughly change this bad work style.

### 中国煤建公司北京分公司  不执行供应木材协议书

    中国煤建公司北京分公司
    不执行供应木材协议书
    编辑同志：一九五三年国家的基本建设要大规模地开始了，做好木材的定级和及时供应合乎规格质量的木材工作，是十分重要的。但中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司去年的供应工作却是不能令人满意的。该公司不按照供应木材协议书执行，以致损害了工程质量，推迟了工程进度，使国家的基本建设受到不应有的损失。因此我愿意提出来引起他们的注意。
    我们公司的第二工程处，去年向中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司购入的一等材杂木椽子一百一十余立方公尺，红白松脚手板二百余立方公尺中，有百分之三十是腐朽到一碰就断的。在用料急迫的情况下，只好将质量不好的木材勉强使用，实在不能用的就当木柴处理了。第五工程处向该公司买了六十立方公尺三等材的红白松薄板，拟作建筑器材用。后来因为这批薄板完全不合乎规格，只好将其中较好的百分之六十改做工棚望板，其余百分之四十作废物处理了。第六工程处购自该公司的红白松方木总计三百八十八点四二三立方公尺，其中运到圆明园工地锯望板用的三等松木，有百分之六十不合规格。我公司向该公司购买杉槁三万八千根，脚手板一千三百立方公尺，双方并订有协议书。但交货时发现很多脚手板都是有蚂蚁哨及虫眼的，有百分之二十不能用。仅这批脚手板，我们损失达三亿余元。我们需要的杉槁应该是十公尺长和五公分直径的，但该公司却以十公尺长和八九公分直径的杉元木代替杉槁售给我们。这样就不便于使用，这批杉木就使我们共浪费二亿四千万元。因脚手板质量不好，在回民学院及十三区小学两工地，都发生过脚手板折断，摔伤工人的事故。
    总之，去年一年，仅北京市建筑公司二、五、六三个工程处的统计购买中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司不符质量规格的木材，就达七百余立方公尺，损失在八亿元左右，至于建设工程蒙受的损害就无法计算。为了完成祖国今年的伟大建设任务，该公司应该迅速彻底地改变这种恶劣作风。
