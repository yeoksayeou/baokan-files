Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 30th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Military Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a decision on January 22nd regarding strengthening wartime anti-espionage struggle and the work of the People's Self-Defense Forces.

The decision pointed out: The American and British aggressors and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee clique, have suffered repeated shameful defeats militarily and politically. On the one hand, they use all kinds of unprecedentedly barbaric warfare methods, and on the other hand, they send various secret agents to sneak into the northern part of the Republic to carry out sabotage and assassination activities such as spying on military secrets, spreading rumors, arson and robbery, and guiding enemy aircraft to bomb. Therefore, strengthening the anti-espionage struggle and the work of the People's Self-Defense Forces, preventing the infiltration of special agents and saboteurs, and promptly reporting and arresting those who have infiltrated have become the most important tasks for ensuring victory at the front and further consolidating the rear.

The decision stipulates that propaganda and education on anti-espionage struggle should be widely carried out among the people so that the anti-espionage struggle becomes a struggle of the entire people. Those who have made contributions to the anti-espionage struggle will be commended and rewarded, and those who hide and harbor special agents will be punished. Special agents who surrender themselves will be treated leniently, and special agents who are unrepentant will be subject to on-the-spot public trials and severely punished in accordance with wartime laws. The decision also stipulates that the security work of organs and factories and the work of the self-defense forces should be strengthened, and the work of local self-defense forces should be further strengthened.

    朝鲜军事委员会决定
    加强战时反特务斗争
    【新华社平壤三十日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军事委员会二十二日通过了关于加强战时反特务斗争和人民自卫队工作的决定。
    决定指出：美英侵略者和它们的走狗李承晚匪帮，由于在军事上和政治上接连遭到可耻的失败，一方面使用各种空前野蛮的战争方法，一方面又派遣各种特务潜入共和国北部，进行刺探军事机密、散布谣言、放火抢劫和指引敌机轰炸等破坏暗害工作。因此，加强反特务斗争和人民自卫队工作，防止特务破坏分子潜入，并及时告发和逮捕潜入者，已成为保障前线胜利和进一步巩固后方的最重要的任务。
    决定中规定，要在人民群众中广泛展开反特务斗争的宣传教育工作，使反特务斗争成为全体人民的斗争。对在反特务斗争中有功的给予表扬和奖励，对隐藏和包庇特务分子的给予惩罚。对于自首的特务分子予以宽待，对于怙恶不悛的特务分子将组织现地公审，按照战时法令严惩。决定中并规定要加强机关、工厂的保卫工作和自卫队工作，并进一步加强地方的自卫队工作。
