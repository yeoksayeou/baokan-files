　　Beijing is actively preparing for large-scale capital construction scheduled to begin in the spring.

　　In early January of this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee and the building materials and transportation departments jointly organized the "Beijing Municipal Local Building Materials Allocation Joint Office" to overcome the chaotic phenomenon of material preparation for construction projects in the past and to achieve planned supply of materials and rational use of transportation resources. After the establishment of the "Beijing Municipal Local Building Materials Allocation Joint Office," it first consulted with various construction units of the central government and North China in Beijing to formulate the "Beijing 1953 Brick, Tile, and Lime Distribution Method." It stipulates that the bricks, tiles, and lime required for each construction project shall be uniformly distributed by the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee. All bricks, tiles, and lime produced by state-owned, local state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private enterprises shall be controlled by the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, and no unit shall sell them without authorization. The products of private kilns are controlled by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and are also included in the distribution plan, in addition to supplying civilian use. If local production cannot meet the demand, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee will contact other places to transfer them in, and construction units shall not purchase them from outside without approval. When public and private kilns from other places come to Beijing to promote the sale of bricks, tiles, and lime, they must also make a plan and obtain approval from the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and shall not sell directly to construction units. After these measures were formulated and implemented, the chaotic phenomenon of blind rush purchases of bricks and tiles by various construction units in the past was overcome, and the smooth progress of the supply of building materials was guaranteed. Secondly, the Joint Office uniformly controls the transportation resources of public and private cars, carriages, and other industries in the city. In the past, due to the lack of unified leadership, unreasonable phenomena such as "transportation towards each other" occurred. For example, bricks, tiles, and lime produced in the eastern suburbs of Beijing were transported to projects in the western suburbs, while bricks, tiles, and lime produced in the western suburbs were transported to projects in the eastern suburbs, resulting in a waste of limited transportation resources. Since the unified scheduling of transportation forces began in early January this year, not only has the transportation cost been reduced, but also the material preparation process for construction projects has been accelerated.

    北京市为大规模基本建设作准备
    统一调配建筑材料和运输力量
    北京市正积极为春季行将动工的大规模基本建设作准备工作。
    今年一月初，北京市人民政府财政经济委员会和建筑材料、运输部门共同组织“北京市地方建筑材料调配联合办公室”，用以克服过去建筑工程备料时的混乱现象，达到有计划的供应材料和合理的使用运输力量的目的。“北京市地方建筑材料调配联合办公室”成立后，首先和中央及华北在北京的各个建筑单位商讨，制订了“北京市一九五三年砖、瓦、石灰分配办法”。规定各建筑工程所需砖、瓦、石灰，一律由北京市财政经济委员会统一分配。国营、地方国营、合作社以及公私合营企业所生产的砖、瓦、石灰，全部由市财委会掌握，各单位不得擅自出售。私营窑厂的产品，则由北京市人民政府工商局掌握，除供应民用外，其余也统一列入分配计划之中。如本市生产供不应求时，统由市财委会向外地接洽调入，各建筑单位未经批准不得私自到外面采购。外埠公、私营窑厂来京推销砖、瓦、石灰时，也须作出计划由市财委会批准，不得直接向各建筑单位销售。这些办法制订并付诸实施后，克服了过去各建筑单位盲目的抢购砖、瓦的混乱现象，保证了建筑材料的供应工作顺利地进行。其次，联合办公室统一地掌握了全市公私营汽车、马车等业运输力量。过去因为没有统一的领导，产生了“相向运输”的不合理现象，例如出产在北京东郊的砖、瓦、石灰往西郊的工程上运，出产在西郊的砖、瓦、石灰却往东郊的工程上运，致使有限的运输力量浪费了不少。自从今年一月初统一调度运输力量后，不但减低了运输费用，而且加速了建筑工程的备料进程。　（据新华社讯）
