Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th: TASS Moscow, January 19th: Grigoryan published an article in "Pravda" commenting on the results of the Asian Socialist Conference held in Rangoon from January 6th to 15th.

Grigoryan wrote that the recent conference of right-wing socialist parties in Asian countries held in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, once again demonstrates the unease felt by imperialist blocs regarding their position in Asia.

British imperialists have long been alarmed by the sharp rise of the national liberation movement in the East, the enormous appeal of the Chinese revolution, the awakening of the broad masses in colonial countries, and the growing strength of communist parties in these countries.

American imperialist groups, who are increasingly and forcefully infiltrating Asian regions that until recently were the hunting grounds of British monopoly groups, are equally alarmed.

We should examine the purpose of the Asian Socialist Conference organized by imperialist reactionaries in light of these developments.

The Socialist Parties of Burma, India, and Indonesia, which played the role of initiators of the Rangoon Conference, published a joint statement shortly before the conference opened under the appealing title of "Socialist Principles and Objectives." What is the real situation concealed by this lengthy statement, and what is the true value of the promises of the right-wing socialist leaders, can be seen from the actions of the authors of the above statement, the servants and running dogs of imperialism.

Narrating their actions, Grigoryan spoke of the organization of the armed forces by the right-wing socialist traitors in Burma, which under the guidance of the right-wing socialists brutally suppressed the people's resistance forces; he spoke of the Indonesian right-wing socialist party, under the leadership of its leader Sjahrir—one of the active members of the Rangoon Conference—pursuing a policy of compromise with the Dutch colonialists. Finally, he spoke of the activities of Indian Socialist Party leaders Asoka Mehta and Dr. Lohia.

Grigoryan pointed out that these facts expose the many statements of the right-wing socialist parties, from which it can be seen what they actually do and their role as agents of imperialism, striving to crush the rising national liberation movement, destroy workers' organizations, and betray the struggle of the Asian people for national freedom and independence at any time.

The collusion between the reactionary leaders of the right-wing socialist parties of Asian countries and the American and British imperialist blocs, as well as the servile behavior of these leaders in front of the imperialist reactionaries, has aroused great dissatisfaction among the party members of these parties. Under pressure from below, those attending the Rangoon Conference had to adopt left-wing "revolutionary" rhetoric in order to deceive the socialist party members. On the other hand, the discussions of the main agenda (international situation, land issues, and the relationship between Asian socialist parties, etc.) were held in secret meetings, mostly in special committees, because they wanted to hide the true opinions of those reactionary leaders who were trying to achieve the main purpose of this conference, and not let public opinion know. This purpose was to establish pillars in Asian countries to serve imperialist reactionaries in order to suppress the rising national liberation movement and crush the progressive forces fighting for the national and democratic interests of the Asian people.

Although almost all the work of this conference was carried out in secret, and journalists could not obtain detailed information about the conference, it is known that there were great differences of opinion between them on many issues. The discussion of many issues was fruitless, and the general resolutions passed on the main issues did not specify concrete action plans, but only helplessly described the situation and made some comforting promises.

Grigoryan wrote when talking about the so-called "Socialist International's" attempt to pull the participants of the Rangoon Conference into its organization that the "true face of the Socialist International" had long been exposed in front of the broad party members of the Asian socialist parties: the "Socialist International" is a component part of the American aggressive bloc. The Asian socialist party members are increasingly clearly aware of the pure futility of "democratic socialism" and the comforting tricks of the West European right-wing socialist leaders who pretend to be a "third force." They are convinced that the reactionary leadership of the right-wing socialist parties also pursues a policy of oppressing backward countries and colonial countries, which is the same as the policy pursued by the imperialist blocs in the countries where these socialist parties are located. Therefore, the Asian socialist party members spurn this so-called "International."

Therefore, the reactionary leaders of the right-wing socialist parties in Asian countries, taking into account the mood of the masses, did not dare to openly participate in the European "International" of socialist traitors, and decided to establish their own organization, however, this organization will maintain close ties with the "International."

Grigoryan concluded by saying that, in this way, Attlee, who repeatedly spoke at the conference wanting to pull the Asian socialist parties into the "International," failed in his mission. Of course, this failure does not mean that the leaders of the "Socialist International" will stop trying to influence the activities of the Asian socialist parties.

Grigoryan finally said that the Rangoon Conference once again shows how the imperialists of the United States, Britain, and other countries, in the current international situation, are trying to undermine the maintenance and consolidation of peace, mobilize the institutions they have pieced together, and use these institutions to carry out their criminal plans to launch another war.

    苏联“真理报”发表专文
    揭穿帝国主义组织“亚洲社会党会议”的阴谋
     【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：格里戈里扬在“真理报”发表一篇文章，评论一月六日到十五日在仰光举行的亚洲社会党会议的结果。
    格里戈里扬写道，亚洲国家的右翼社会党最近在缅甸首都仰光举行会议这件事，又一次表明帝国主义集团对他们在亚洲的地位感到不安。
    英帝国主义者对东方民族解放运动的急剧高涨、中国革命的巨大吸引力，殖民地国家中广大群众的觉醒以及这些国家中共产党力量的日益增长，长久以来就感到惊慌不安。
    正在愈加有力地渗入直到最近以前还是英国垄断集团的猎场的亚洲地区的美帝国主义集团，也同样感到惊慌。
    我们应当参照这些发展来研究帝国主义反动派组织亚洲社会党会议的目的。
    扮演着仰光会议发起者的缅甸、印度和印尼的社会党，在会议开幕前不久用动听的题目“社会主义的原则和目的”发表了一项联合声明。这篇冗长的声明所掩饰的真实情况是什么，以及右翼社会党领袖们诺言的真正价值是什么，可以由上述声明的作者、帝国主义的仆从和走狗们的行径中看出来。
    格里戈里扬叙述他们的行径时，讲到缅甸的右翼社会党卖国贼在缅甸的武装部队组织，这种部队在右翼社会党人的指导下残忍地镇压人民抵抗部队；讲到印尼右翼社会党在它的领袖沙利尔——仰光会议的活跃分子之一——的领导下执行和荷兰殖民者妥协的政策。最后，讲到印度社会党领袖阿索卡·梅达和洛希亚博士的活动。
    格里戈里扬指出，这些事实揭露了右翼社会党的许多声明，从这里可以看出他们实际上的所作所为和作为帝国主义代理人的角色，他们力图粉碎日益高涨的民族解放运动，击破工人的组织，随时背叛亚洲各国人民为争取民族自由与独立而进行的斗争。
    亚洲各国的右翼社会党的反动领袖和美英帝国主义集团狼狈为奸以及这些领袖在帝国主义反动派面前的奴颜婢膝，已引起这些党的党员群众的极大不满。由于受到下面的压力，出席仰光会议的人不得不采用左的“革命的”辞句，以便哄骗社会党的党员群众。另一方面，他们讨论主要议程（国际形势、土地问题和亚洲社会党之间的关系等问题）时是举行的秘密会议，而大都是在特别委员会中讨论的，这是因为他们想要掩盖那些图谋达到这次会议主要目的的反动领袖的真正意见，不让公共舆论知道。这个目的是要在亚洲各国建立为帝国主义反动派服务的支柱，以便镇压日益高涨的民族解放运动，粉碎为争取亚洲人民民族利益和民主利益而斗争的进步力量。
    虽然这次会议差不多全部工作都是秘密进行的，新闻记者们得不到会议的详细情况，但是大家已知道，在许多问题上，他们之间有很大的分歧意见。许多问题的讨论都毫无结果，同时对主要问题所通过的一般性决议，也没有指出具体的行动计划，只是无能为力地把形势叙述了一下，并作一些笼络人心的诺言。
    格里戈里扬谈到所谓“社会党国际”想把仰光会议的参加者拉进它的组织的企图时写道，但是“社会党国际的真面目”早就在亚洲的社会党广大党员群众的面前暴露了：“社会党国际”是美国侵略集团的一个构成部分。亚洲的社会党党员群众愈来愈明确地认识到“民主社会主义”的纯粹虚妄和那些装做“第三种力量”的西欧右翼社会党领袖的笼络人心的把戏。他们深信，右翼社会党的反动领导机构也是奉行压迫落后国家和殖民地国家的政策的，和这些社会党所在国的帝国主义集团所奉行的政策一样。因此，亚洲社会党的党员群众唾弃这个所谓“国际”。
    因此，亚洲国家的右翼社会党的反动领袖们考虑到群众的情绪，不敢公开参加社会党卖国贼的欧洲“国际”，而决定设立他们自己的组织，然而，这个组织将和“国际”保持密切的联系。
    格里戈里扬总结说道，这样，在会议上一再发言要想把亚洲社会党拉入“国际”的艾德礼，他的使命是失败了。当然这种失败并不意味着“社会党国际”的领袖们将就此不再努力影响亚洲社会党的活动。
    格里戈里扬最后说道，仰光会议又一次显示美国、英国和其他国家的帝国主义者如何在目前的国际局势中，力图破坏和平的保持和巩固、动员他们所拼凑的机构，利用这种机构来进行他们发动另一次战争的罪恶计划。
