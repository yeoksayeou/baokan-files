    Urban Construction Should Closely Coordinate with Industrial Construction
    Gu Ming
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel) encountered many new problems in the process of large-scale construction, one of which is how to coordinate urban construction and industrial construction. Not only Anshan City, but all cities with industrial construction will encounter this new problem. Whether this problem can be solved in a timely and appropriate manner affects the development of capital construction and the speed of industrialization. Here I provide some relevant information on this issue for reference in order to study and improve our current construction work.
    The Issue of Unified Leadership in Urban Construction
    Large-scale industrial construction has begun nationwide. With the emergence of new industrial areas or the restoration, renovation, and expansion of existing industrial areas, there will inevitably be large-scale construction of new urban areas, including residential buildings, schools, shops, cooperatives, hospitals, bathhouses, cultural palaces, and hotels, as well as municipal facilities such as transportation roads, trams, trolleybuses, water and sewage systems, electric lights, gas, and telephones. In other words, old industrial cities need to be renovated and expanded, and new cities will be born in various places. We lack experience in large-scale industrial construction, and we also lack experience in urban construction. Now we are faced with the question: What kind of city should we build? What will be its scale of development in five or ten years? To solve these problems, the first step is to determine a long-term industrial construction plan and an urban construction plan that is compatible with it. Ansteel's experience in 1952 proved that without a unified urban construction plan, it is not only impossible to build a new city well, but it will also greatly hinder the development of industrial construction. With the help of Soviet experts, Ansteel has formulated a long-term plan for renovation and expansion, but Anshan City's municipal construction has not yet developed a corresponding plan to match Ansteel's construction. Therefore, when Ansteel built hundreds of thousands of square meters of residential buildings in 1952, Anshan City only had a pseudo-Manchukuo "Metropolitan Construction Plan Configuration Map" for reference. This configuration map was obviously not in line with our construction needs: it divided Anshan City into a Japanese residential area east of the railway, a Chinese residential area west of the railway, and the urban area was configured as a capitalist-style commercial area. However, there was no time for temporary measurement and reconfiguration, so we had to adopt an improved method, spending a lot of time changing the streets in the residential area. In addition, due to the lack of a unified plan for municipal construction, the construction of water and sewage systems, roads, electric lights, gas, etc., was not able to keep pace with the construction of new residences in a timely manner, resulting in a waste of transportation capacity, labor, temporary water and electricity, and engineering costs for temporary roads during the residential construction period. Such situations also exist in other cities. Based on the construction experience of Ansteel and Anshan City, we believe that for urban construction in both new and old industrial areas, it is necessary to establish a unified urban construction committee, composed of the main responsible persons and experts from the local Party, government, and enterprise organs, with the construction bureau of the municipal people's government or other equivalent institutions as the daily administrative body, to carry out the following tasks:
    I. Formulate urban development plans, based on the industrial and commercial development situation within five to ten years, appropriately estimate the needs of various buildings, public facilities, and urban transportation, predict the construction area, land area, and urban layout, and make a comprehensive development plan.
    II. According to the municipal construction development plan, the state should uniformly approve municipal construction investment so that municipal construction can uniformly and systematically build roads, water and sewage systems, flood control dikes and canals, electrical lines, trams, trolleybuses, hospitals, shops, police stations, and other public facilities before residential construction, in advance to serve engineering construction. Otherwise, the simultaneous construction of municipal construction projects and industrial construction projects will hinder each other, prolong the construction period, and increase costs.
    III. According to the urban development plan, conduct general topographic surveys, draw general layout plans for urban development, and specifically determine the location and distribution maps of streets, factories, schools, residences, and their public buildings.
    IV. All public buildings, buried objects, and public and private property rights within the urban planning area must be uniformly investigated, registered, mapped, and numbered for future processing.
    V. In accordance with the municipal construction investment plan, and according to the size of the engineering tasks, supplement and equip the municipal construction construction departments with corresponding technical forces (including civil engineering, water, electricity, surveying, etc.), tools, equipment, and investment, and organize professional engineering teams.
    How to Solve Design Problems
    The renovation and construction of large cities are closely related to the lives of the people. It is best to invite Soviet urban construction experts to provide guidance, absorb the advanced experience of Soviet urban construction, eliminate the influence of capitalist urban construction ideas, and correct design ideas in order to build new cities for the people and better serve economic construction.
    The overall design of municipal construction must precede the architectural design. The architectural design for each year must also determine the design mission statement half a year before the construction year, stipulating the total area, nature, purpose, materials used, cost estimate, start and completion dates of the building, and notify the municipal construction committee. After approval, the construction area is delineated, and topographic surveys and geological surveys are carried out to obtain reliable data such as soil quality, soil bearing capacity, groundwater, and weather conditions, prepare an engineering budget, and draw a general layout plan and construction drawings. The municipal aspect will coordinate with the design and construction. The following issues should be noted in the design:
    I. General architectural design should use standard designs as much as possible. Based on the development of the national economy, the people's living standards, the availability of building materials in a certain area, as well as climate, customs, and living habits, formulate multiple types of standard designs. According to advanced Soviet experience, staff and worker housing, schools, canteens, clubs, hospitals, etc., can be divided into several standard designs such as A, B, and C. When applied in different areas, they can be applied with slight modifications according to the actual situation.
    II. Multi-story buildings are more economical than single-story buildings. The working areas of urban residents are concentrated. If there are many single-story buildings, the transportation distance will inevitably be extended, commuting costs will increase, and time will be wasted, which is extremely uneconomical. However, due to technical conditions and the difficulty of obtaining building materials such as steel and cement, buildings should not be too high at present, because high-rise buildings require conditions such as steel bars, concrete, and elevators to cooperate. The design and construction require higher technology, so general residences and schools should be three or four stories high. Secondly, compared with single-story buildings, multi-story buildings can save land area. In 1952, Ansteel built 100,000 square meters of three-story residential buildings, occupying a total area of ​​more than 300,000 square meters, of which the building configuration only accounted for 13%, roads accounted for 17%, and green area reached 70%; while another 100,000 square meters of single-story residential buildings occupied 630,000 square meters, of which the residential buildings accounted for 20%, roads accounted for 31%, and the green area only reached 49%. The large land area requires a large municipal investment, such as roads, electric wires, and water and sewage systems, which need to be built twice as much; on the other hand, it also increases the transportation difficulties for the employees in the residential area. In addition, when carrying out single-story construction, in order to save land, the houses are inevitably configured crowdedly, which is not conducive to hygiene and fire prevention. Finally, the cost of multi-story buildings is also lower. Due to the influence of climatic conditions in the Northeast, the depth of the ground freezing line in winter is more than one meter, and the foundation of buildings must be built on the non-frozen layer (according to Soviet experience, an exception can be made if the groundwater level is lower than three meters) to avoid cracks in the walls due to soil freezing and thawing expansion and contraction. Therefore, the foundation used for single-story and three-story buildings is similar. Moreover, three-story buildings save labor and materials compared with single-story buildings, which can reduce costs by 11% and save 2% of skilled workers.
    III. Welfare facilities should be appropriately dispersed. For example, primary schools, bathhouses, hospitals, clubs, cooperatives, and shops should be appropriately distributed according to residential area, traffic population, households, and living standards in a planned manner. In today's situation where the country has just begun construction, extravagance and luxury are not allowed.
    Establish a professional construction engineering company, uniformly accepting the leadership of local construction departments
    Based on Ansteel's three years of experience in civil engineering construction, especially the experience of the two major projects in 1952, general residential building construction and factory building construction are completely different in nature. Factory building construction is mainly a large amount of concrete foundation engineering and steel structure frame engineering; while general residential building construction is brick, wood, and tile engineering. Although there is concrete engineering, it is relatively simple. At the same time, there are also great differences in the technical requirements of the two. Therefore, in order to quickly cultivate the construction force for factory buildings and foundation engineering, the factory building foundation engineering and general building engineering should be separated, and two professional engineering companies should be established (also separated in the Soviet Union). The advantage of this is specialization, which is convenient for cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to improve their business and technical level, so as to accelerate the speed of industrial construction. In addition, the most ideal situation is that the housing engineering company is led by the local urban construction department, so that it can directly obtain the cooperation of local industries under unified leadership, such as the supply of bricks, tiles, stones, sand, lime, small hardware, and plumbing equipment, which is more convenient. It is also convenient to carry out municipal construction uniformly, consider the balance of urban construction forces, and the growth of reserve forces.

    城市建设应与工业建设密切配合
    顾明
    鞍山钢铁公司（以下简称鞍钢）在大规模的建设过程中，碰到许多新的问题，其中之一便是城市建设和工业建设如何配合的问题。不仅是鞍山市，凡有工业建设的城市都会遇到这一新问题。这个问题能否及时地适当解决，影响着基本建设的发展，影响着工业化的速度。这里我特提供一些有关这个问题的参考资料，以便研究改进我们当前的建设工作。
    统一城市建设的领导问题
    全国性的大规模工业建设已经开始，随着新工业区的出现或原有工业区的恢复、改建与扩充，必将大兴土木，建设新的市区，包括住宅、学校、商店、合作社、医院、澡塘、文化宫和旅馆等建筑物，以及交通道路、有轨电车、无轨电车、上下水道、电灯、煤气、电话等市政设施。也就是说，旧的工业城市需要改建与扩大，新的城市将在各地诞生。我们对大规模工业建设缺乏经验，对于城市建设也同样没有经验，现在就碰到了这样的问题：建设一个什么样的城市？五年或十年之内它的发展规模又是怎样？解决这些问题，首先便要确定一个长远的工业建设计划，以及一个与之相适应的城市建设计划。鞍钢一九五二年的经验证明，没有统一的城市建设计划，不仅建设不好一个新城市，且将大大妨碍工业建设的发展。鞍钢在苏联专家帮助之下，已订出了一个改建扩大的长远计划，但鞍山市政建设方面却还没有与鞍钢建设相适应的配合计划。因此一九五二年鞍钢修建几十万平方公尺的住宅时，鞍山市方面仅有一个伪满“都邑建设计划配置图”作为参考。这个配置图显然是不合我们建设需要的：它将鞍山市分成铁路东日本人住区，铁路西中国人住区，市街是按资本主义式商业区配置的。但要临时测量重新配置，时间又不允许，后来只好采取改良的办法，耗费很长时间变更住宅区的街道。此外，由于市政建设没有统一的计划，因此在上下水道、道路、电灯、煤气等建设方面，也都没有能及时配合新住宅的建筑，以致在住宅修建期中浪费了许多运输力、人工、临时水电、临时道路的工程费用。像这样的情况，其他城市也是存在的。根据鞍钢和鞍山市的建设经验，我们认为不论新旧工业区的城市建设，都必须成立统一的城市建设委员会，由当地的党、政府和企业机关的主要负责人和专家组成，以市人民政府的建设局或其他相当机构作为日常办事机关，进行下列工作：
    一、制订城市发展计划，根据五年到十年之内工商业发展的情况，适当估量各种建筑物、公共设施与市内交通的需要，预计建筑面积、占地面积、市街布置，作出全面发展计划。
    二、根据市政建设发展计划，由国家统一核定市政建设投资，以便市政建设方面在住宅建筑之前统一地、有步骤地建设好道路、上下水道、防洪堤渠、电气线路、有轨电车、无轨电车、医院、商店、派出所等公共设施，提前为工程建设服务。否则，市政建设工程与工业建设工程同时施工，就会互相妨碍，延长工期，提高成本。
    三、根据城市发展计划，进行总平面地形测量、绘制城市发展计划总平面配置图，具体测定市街、工厂、学校、住宅和其公共建筑物的位置分布图。
    四、凡属城市计划区域内的公共建筑物、埋设物、公私地产权，必须统一调查登记，绘图编号，以便以后处理。
    五、必须按照市政建设投资计划，根据工程任务大小，给市政建设施工部门补充配备相适应的技术力量（包括土木、水道、电气、测量等）、工具设备和投资，组织专业工程队。
    如何解决设计问题
    大城市的改建、新建和人民生活的关系极大，最好能聘请苏联城市建设专家指导，吸收苏联城市建设的先进经验，肃清资本主义城市建设思想的影响，端正设计思想，以便建设好人民的新城市，更好地为经济建设事业服务。
    市政建设的总体设计，必须先于建筑设计。每年的建筑设计也须要在施工年度半年以前确定好设计任务书，规定出建筑的总面积、性质、用途、用材、造价概算、开工竣工日期，通知市政建设委员会，经批准后划定建筑区域，再进行地形测量与地质勘测，取得土质、地耐力、地下水、气象等可靠资料，编制工程预算，绘制总平面图、施工图；市政方面则与该项设计和施工进行配合。在设计问题上应注意以下几个问题：
    一、一般建筑设计应尽量采用标准设计。根据国民经济的发展，人民的生活水平，某一地区便于取得建筑材料，以及气候、风俗与生活习惯等条件，制订多种类型的标准设计。根据苏联先进经验，职工住宅、学校、食堂、俱乐部、医院等均可分甲、乙、丙等数种标准设计，在不同地区应用时，只要结合实际情况略加修改，即可应用。
    二、单层建筑物与多层建筑物比较，多层建筑物较为经济。城市人民工作地区集中，如单层建筑多，交通距离势必延长，通勤费用增大，时间浪费也多，这是极不经济的。但限于技术条件、钢筋水泥等建筑材料的困难，目前楼房不宜太高，因为高楼大厦必需钢筋、混凝土、电梯等条件来配合，设计、施工均需较高的技术，所以一般住宅、学校以三、四层为好。其次，与单层建筑比较，多层建筑可节约用地面积。鞍钢一九五二年建筑十万平方公尺三层楼住宅，共占地三十余万平方公尺，其配置建筑只占地百分之十三，道路占百分之十七，绿化面积达百分之七十；而另一个十万平方公尺单层住宅建筑，用地六十三万平方公尺，住宅占地百分之二十，道路占地百分之三十一，绿化面积只达百分之四十九。用地面积大，耗费市政投资就大，如道路、电线、上下水道就需要多建一倍；另一方面，又增加该住区职工交通困难。此外，在进行单层建筑时，为了节省地皮，势必使房屋之间配置拥挤，对卫生、防火等方面也不利。最后，多层建筑成本也较低，东北因气候条件影响，冬季地面冰冻线深度达一公尺以上，建筑物基础必须建筑在不冻层上（根据苏联经验，如果地下水位低于三公尺时可例外），以免因土壤冻溶涨缩而造成墙壁裂缝，因此，单层和三层建筑所用地基相差无几。而且三层又比单层节约人工、材料，可降低成本百分之十一，节省技术工人百分之二。
    三、福利设施以适当分散为好。如子弟小学、澡塘、医院和俱乐部、合作社、商店，应有计划地按住区面积、交通人口、住户、生活水平，作适当分布。在今天国家刚开始建设的情况下，不容许铺张和奢华。
    成立专业建筑工程公司，统一接受地方建设部门领导
    根据鞍钢三年来土木建筑工程的经验，特别是一 九五二年两大工程的经验，一般住宅建筑和厂房建筑工程性质绝然不同，厂房建筑主要是大量混凝土基础工程、钢结构房架工程；而一般住宅建筑则是砖木瓦工程，混凝土工程虽有，也比较简单。同时，两者的技术要求，也有很大差别。因此，为了迅速培养厂房和基础工程的施工力量，应该把厂房基础工程和一般建筑工程分开，成立两种专业工程公司（在苏联也是分开的）。其好处是专业化，便于干部、技术人员、技工提高业务和技术水平，以加速工业建设的速度。此外，最理想的是：住宅工程公司受地方城市建设部门领导，这样可以在统一领导下直接取得地方工业的配合，如砖、瓦、石、砂子、石灰、小五金、水暖管器材等的供应就比较方便，也便于统一地进行市政建设，考虑城市建设力量的平衡，以及后备力量的生长。
