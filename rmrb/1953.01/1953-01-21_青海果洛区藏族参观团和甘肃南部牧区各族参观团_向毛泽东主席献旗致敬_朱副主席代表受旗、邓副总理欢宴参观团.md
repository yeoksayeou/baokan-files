Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: The Qinghai Province Golog Tibetan Delegation and the Southern Gansu Pastoral Area Ethnic Groups Delegation presented flags to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government on the afternoon of the 20th. Vice-Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government accepted the flags on behalf of Chairman Mao.

    Present at the flag presentation were Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Vice-Chairmen Ulanhu, Liu Geping, and Liu Chun, members of the Nationalities Affairs Commission Zhu Zaoguan, and Deputy Director of the General Office of the Central People's Government Committee Yu Xinqing.

    After the flag presentation, Vice-Chairman Zhu held a tea party. At the meeting, Kang Keming, Deputy Head of the Qinghai Province Golog Tibetan Delegation, and Daji, Head of the Southern Gansu Pastoral Area Delegation, expressed their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Central People's Government. Finally, Vice-Chairman Zhu encouraged everyone to strengthen unity and work hard to improve production, trade, medicine, health, and transportation in ethnic minority areas, and gradually improve the living standards of all ethnic groups.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping of the State Council of the Central People's Government hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM on the 20th to entertain all members of the Qinghai Province Golog Tibetan Delegation and the Southern Gansu Pastoral Area Ethnic Groups Delegation.

    At the welcoming banquet, Vice-Premier Deng delivered a welcome speech, saying: The Golog area and the Southern Gansu pastoral area have long suffered from the cruel rule and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. The Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandit gangs directly slaughtered and plundered the Tibetan people on the one hand, and on the other hand, they provoked relations between the Tibetan people and other fraternal ethnic groups, as well as internal relations within the Tibetan ethnic group, to facilitate their rule. This resulted in a decline in the Tibetan population, a decline in production, and the people's lives falling into poverty and backwardness.

    Vice-Premier Deng continued: In the past three years, thanks to the implementation of Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy by the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly united. Chairman Mao's ethnic policy requires that all our ethnic groups be treated equally, implement unity and mutual assistance, and build our own happy and fulfilling lives. Only with good unity can all construction undertakings proceed smoothly. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a good example of this, because of good unity, coupled with other conditions, the population has increased and animal husbandry has developed rapidly in the past five years, achieving "prosperity for both people and livestock," becoming a model for the development of all pastoral areas. Our staff in the Tibetan areas have helped everyone to do a good job in unity in the past, and in the future, we must continue to work hard to help the Tibetan people further strengthen unity and advance towards the development path of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    Vice-Premier Deng finally pointed out: Imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are not reconciled to the unity of our people of all ethnic groups, nor are they reconciled to our people of all ethnic groups living a good life. They always use all means to provoke the unity between our ethnic groups, and I hope everyone will be vigilant.

    The welcoming banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of close unity.

    【新华社二十日讯】青海省果洛区藏族参观团和甘肃南部牧区各民族参观团，在二十日下午向中央人民政府毛泽东主席献旗。中央人民政府朱德副主席代表毛主席受旗。
    献旗时，在场的有中央人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉，副主任委员乌兰夫、刘格平、刘春，民族事务委员会委员朱早观和中央人民政府委员会办公厅副主任余心清。
    献旗完毕，朱副主席举行茶会。会上，青海省果洛区藏族参观团副团长康克明和甘肃南部牧区参观团团长达吉，先后表示向毛主席和中央人民政府各首长致谢。最后，朱副主席勉励大家加强团结，努力做好少数民族地区的生产、贸易、医药卫生和交通等工作，逐步提高各族人民生活水平。
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府政务院邓小平副总理，在二十日下午七时设宴招待青海省果洛区藏族参观团和甘肃南部牧区各民族参观团全体人员。
    招待宴会上，邓副总理致欢迎词说：果洛地区和甘南牧区，过去曾长期地遭受国民党反动派的惨酷统治和压迫，蒋介石和马步芳匪帮一方面直接屠杀和掠夺藏区人民，一方面挑拨藏族同其他兄弟民族的关系以及藏族内部的关系，以利于他们的统治。这样就使得藏区人口减少、生产衰退、人民的生活陷入贫困和落后的境地。
    邓副总理接着说：三年来，由于人民政府实行了毛主席伟大的民族政策，各民族人民已经空前地团结起来了。毛主席的民族政策是要我们各民族一律平等、实行团结互助，建设自己幸福美满的生活。只有团结得好，一切建设事业才能顺利地进行，内蒙古自治区就是因为团结得好，再加上其他的条件，所以五年来人口增加、牧畜业发展很快，做到了“人畜两旺”，成为各牧区向前发展的榜样。我们在藏区的工作人员，过去是帮助大家做好团结工作，今后更要继续努力，帮助藏区人民进一步加强团结，向着内蒙古自治区的发展道路前进。
    邓副总理最后指出：帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮是不甘心我们各民族人民团结，不甘心我们各民族人民过好日子的，他们总是用尽一切办法，挑拨我们各民族间的团结，希望大家严加警惕。
    招待宴会在亲密团结的空气中进行。
