To the Editor:
I want to accuse Zhou Ziping, cultural and educational assistant in the Third District of Pingyin County, Shandong Province, Meng Xianting, clerk of Longwa Township, and village cadres such as Zhang Erzhu of serious illegal acts of suppressing criticism and violating human rights. I hope you will assist in handling this matter.

Last May and June, I went to participate in the river repair project. Village head Zhang Erzhu (a Communist Party member) overstated the amount of wheat from my family when collecting food grain for the laborers. My wife raised objections, and he held a grudge. He insulted my wife and even wanted to tie her up (but neighbors persuaded him not to). The next day, it rained heavily, and the river repair work was temporarily suspended. I and thirty-odd laborers asked for leave to go home to change clothes and get things. That night, militiamen Zhang Erying and others came to my house with guns, saying they were ordered by the village head to arrest me. They took me to the township, where township clerk Meng Xianting said I was "stealing home" and detained me, saying they would send me to court. The third day, I wanted to go back to work, but they wouldn't let me; they neither sent me to court nor paid attention to me. So I went out to resume work myself. Just as I reached the village entrance, village head Zhang Erzhu led the militiamen to chase after me and wanted to tie me up. My wife found out and rushed to plead with them. Militiaman Zhang Erying even jabbed her stomach with a gun butt, knocking her unconscious. At this time, Zhang Erzhu and others told me to go to the river section to resume work. The leaders of the river section, considering that my wife needed someone to take care of her, let me go home. After I got home, my wife had a miscarriage (she was four or five months pregnant). I reported this situation to district cadre Sang Yinpu. Comrade Sang sent Zhang Erying to the county People's Court; but the People's Court did not handle the matter and released Zhang Erying. Zhang Erying and others even said they would retaliate against me. I had no choice but to ask elementary school teacher Zhang Guanwu to write a letter reflecting this situation to the Jinan "Rural Mass" newspaper. The "Rural Mass" newspaper published my letter on August 13th and pointed out that it was wrong for the county People's Court to release the assailant carelessly. However, after this letter was published, I suffered a series of blows.

Village head Zhang Erzhu and township clerk Meng Xianting threatened me after seeing the newspaper, saying they would "fix" me. The county People's Court called me in, and a cadre (whose name I don't know) said I should not criticize the People's Court and scolded me, slamming the table, scaring me into silence. They also forced me to put my fingerprint on a statement admitting that the situation I reported to the "Rural Mass" newspaper was untrue. Last September, district cultural and educational assistant Zhou Ziping illegally interrogated me several times. On September 6th, he sent militiamen with guns to illegally interrogate me and Zhang Guanwu in the township late at night, glaring at me and scolding me for talking nonsense.

Later, because the masses in my village had opinions about this matter, and the doctor who treated my wife also suggested dealing with the assailant, the county People's Court had to arrest the assailant Zhang Erying and sentenced him to one and a half years in prison, but continued to protect the principal offender Zhang Erzhu. On December 1st, the "Rural Mass" newspaper published a reply from the county People's Court, admitting that the previous handling was incorrect. However, the self-criticism was extremely insincere, and it distorted the facts, saying that my return home while digging the river was without approval, that my wife's miscarriage had no connection with village head Zhang Erzhu, and that Zhang Erying's use of a gun butt to hit my wife was not intentional. The reply did not mention their suppression of criticism.

I request the People's Daily to assist me in ensuring that the illegal cadres who suppressed criticism and violated human rights receive the due punishment.

To the Editor:
After a letter of criticism I wrote on behalf of farmer Zhang Huaidao was published in the Jinan "Rural Mass" newspaper, I suffered many blows. Now I will tell you the situation.

On September 2nd last year, the cultural and educational assistant of the Third District called me in, ordered me to examine my motives for writing the letter, and scolded and satirized me, saying that giving the letter to the newspaper without review was "disrespectful of organization and disregard for leadership." On the night of September 6th, Zhou Ziping again sent militiamen with guns to summon me for illegal interrogation, saying that there were problems with my history and that I was not qualified to be a member of the Youth League, and forcibly ordered me to write a self-criticism. Afterwards, when I went to the county for a meeting, he sent people to scold me at any time, forcing me to "reflect."

The township and village cadres were also extremely hostile to me. During the summer vacation, I went home to see my grandfather. They summoned my grandfather to the township, saying that I was乱criticizing the court and should not have been allowed to go home; and illegally detained my grandfather for more than half a day. As a result, my grandfather was old and could not withstand the shock, so he became seriously ill and has not recovered to this day.

I suffered these blows, which were very painful, so my old illness relapsed, I coughed up blood three or four times, and often suffered from insomnia. I once worried so much that I wanted to commit suicide, but the belief that I "believed in Chairman Mao" supported me, so I wrote a letter to the "Rural Mass" newspaper reflecting the situation of Zhou Ziping and others attacking me. However, the newspaper forwarded this letter to the county party committee, which then forwarded the letter to the county cultural and educational section. Zhou Ziping knew about it and held even more resentment, and instructed some people to find fault with me and "fix" me.

My health is getting worse and worse, and I take medicine all day and suffer from insomnia every night. I ask you to help me and support me so that those who illegally attack people can receive a proper punishment.

### 山东平阴县三区张尔朱等干部打骂关押批评者严重侵犯人权  平阴县委、人民法院、济南农村大众报处理此事有严重缺点

    山东平阴县三区张尔朱等干部打骂关押批评者严重侵犯人权
    平阴县委、人民法院、济南农村大众报处理此事有严重缺点
    （一）
    编辑同志：我要控诉山东省平阴县人民法院以及三区文教助理员周子平、龙洼乡文书孟宪亭和村干部张尔朱等压制批评、侵犯人权的严重违法行为，希望你们协助处理。
    去年五六月间，我去参加修河工程。村长张尔朱（共产党员）在代收民工伙食粮时多称我家麦子。我妻提出意见，他怀恨在心，就辱骂我妻，还要把我妻捆起来（经邻居劝说才没捆）。第二天下大雨，修河暂时停工，我和三十来个民工一起请假回家换衣服、取东西。当天夜里，民兵张尔英等带枪到我家，说是奉村长之命来绑我。他们把我带到乡里，乡文书孟宪亭说我“偷逃回家”，把我押起来，还说要送法院。第三天我要去复工，他们不许；他们既不把我送法院，也不理我。我就自己出去复工。刚走到庄头上，村长张尔朱领着民兵追来要拴我。我妻知道后赶来向他们哀求。民兵张尔英竟在她肚子上捣了一枪托，把她打晕了。这时，张尔朱等却叫我上河段去复工。河段领导同志考虑我妻需人照顾，让我回家。我到家后，妻子流产了（怀孕已四五个月）我就向区干部桑寅甫报告这个情况，桑同志把张尔英送到县人民法院；但人民法院竟不处理这件事，把张尔英释放了。张尔英等还说要报复我。我没法，就请小学教员张冠五代笔，把这个情况写信反映给济南“农村大众”报。“农村大众”报在八月十三日发表了我的信，并指出县人民法院把打人犯马虎地释放是不对的。但是，这封信发表后，我又受到了一连串的打击。
    村长张尔朱、乡文书孟宪亭看到报纸后就威胁我，说是要“整”我。县人民法院找我去，有一个干部（不知姓名）说我不应批评人民法院，并拍着桌子向我发脾气，吓得我不敢作声。他们又强迫我盖了手印，承认向“农村大众”报反映的情况不真实。去年九月间，区文教助理员周子平又连续几次非法审讯我。九月六日那天，他深夜派遣民兵持枪把我和张冠五押到乡里非法审讯，瞪圆眼睛骂我胡说八道。
    后来，因为我村群众对这件事都有意见，为我妻看病的医生也提议要处理凶犯，我县人民法院才不得不逮捕了打人犯张尔英，判处徒刑一年半，但对主犯张尔朱仍加袒护。十二月一日，“农村大众”报发表了我县人民法院的答复，承认上次处理是不对的。但检讨极不深刻，又歪曲事实，说我挖河时回家未经批准，村长张尔朱和我妻流产并无关系，张尔英用枪托捣我妻子不是故意的。而答复中对他们自己压制批评的事实却一字不提。
    我要求人民日报协助我，使压制批评、侵犯人权的违法干部受到应有的处理。
     张怀道（张冠五代笔）
    （二）
    编辑同志：我替农民张怀道代笔写的一封批评信在济南“农村大众”报发表后，受到了很多打击。现在我把情况告诉你们。
    去年九月二日，三区文教助理员把我叫去，命我检查写信动机，并大发脾气地训斥我、讽刺我，说我给报社写信不经审查是“目无组织，轻视领导”。九月六日深夜，周子平又让民兵持枪把我传去，非法审讯，说我历史有问题，不够团员资格，并强令我写反省书。其后我到县里去开会，他又派人随时训斥我，逼我“反省”。
    乡村两级干部也对我极端仇视。暑假时我回家去看祖父。他们就把我祖父传到乡里，说我乱批评法院，不该让我回家；并非法把我祖父扣押了多半天。结果，我祖父年老，禁不起惊吓，就得了重病，至今未好。
    我受到这些打击，非常痛苦，因而旧病复发，吐血三四次，经常失眠。我曾一度愁得想自杀，但“相信毛主席”的信念支持着我，我就把周子平等打击我的情况写信向“农村大众”报反映。但该社把这封信转给我县县委，县委又把信转给县文教科。周子平知道了，更加怀恨，又指使一些人来找我的毛病，“整”我。
    我现在身体愈来愈坏，整天吃药，连夜失眠。我要求你们帮助我、支持我，使这些非法打击人的人能受到严正的处理。　张冠五
