According to recent statistics, the total value of increased production and savings in state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private industrial and mining enterprises in the East China region in 1952 reached 69.843 billion yuan, exceeding the planned target by nearly one time.

The campaign for increased production and savings in East China's factories and mines was launched in a planned and step-by-step manner on the basis of democratic reform and the "Three-Anti" movement, with the implementation of production reform as the central content, and the promotion of advanced experience and the development of rationalization proposals as basic links. Starting in June last year, East China's factories and mines carried out production reforms, starting with a major safety and hygiene inspection. Workers and staff of the first batch of 183 factories in Shanghai put forward more than 460,000 opinions on improving safety and hygiene work during the safety and hygiene inspection. Based on these opinions, all factories and enterprises greatly improved safety and hygiene and working conditions for workers, providing favorable conditions for completing the increased production and savings plan. Subsequently, most factories and mines in East China also carried out a democratic inspection of production management, improved management institutions and labor organization, adjusted wages, and conducted a survey of production capacity. These efforts increased the production efficiency of various factories and mines by two to four times. For example, after the above-mentioned reforms, the state-owned Shanghai Qiujiang Machine Factory increased its production capacity by three to four times, equivalent to building three or four new machine factories of the same scale. The Shanghai textile factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau, on the basis of labor emulation, carried out time reform and wage reform, clarifying that reducing yarn breakage rate was the key to continuously improving textile production. The promotion, consolidation, and creation of advanced experiences had a clear direction, and the output of yarn and cloth was greatly increased, thus completing the task of increasing production and saving 15.4 billion yuan, and the profits turned over to the state also increased by more than 30 percent compared with the original plan.

On the basis of overfulfilling last year's increased production and savings plan, state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private industrial and mining enterprises in East China have now preliminarily proposed a 1953 production plan that increases actual output by 30 percent compared with 1952, and are preparing to manufacture a large number of new products and high-quality products to support the large-scale economic construction of the country.

Except for a few factories and mines, state-owned and local state-owned industries in the Southwest region had overfulfilled the 1952 annual production plan by 12 percent by the end of last year, and also completed the annual increased production and savings plan. In 1952, the total industrial output value of the Southwest region increased by 98 percent compared with 1951. The costs of various major products have generally been reduced. For example, the cost of steel rails was reduced by 29 percent compared with 1951.

The main reason why state-owned and local state-owned industries in the Southwest region completed the plan is that after a series of political movements, the consciousness of the working class has been generally improved, and production enthusiasm has been very high. Especially in the "Three-Anti" movement, factories, mines, and enterprises in the Southwest region resolutely implemented the policy of "'Three-Anti' and production are both important," and achieved great achievements in production. After July last year, the broad masses of workers in the Southwest region, on the basis of high political enthusiasm, deeply launched a region-wide production emulation campaign, resolutely overcame conservative ideas, and further revised the increased production and savings plan. In the fourth quarter of last year, many factories and mines also carried out production reforms, further improving production management and business management, and promoting the production emulation campaign.

Another important reason why state-owned and local state-owned industries in the Southwest region completed the plan is that most factories and mines paid more attention to improving the welfare and safety of workers and staff in the production emulation campaign, carried out major security inspections, and paid special attention to tapping potential, finding tricks, making rationalization proposals, and summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. Employees of the 101 Steel Plant submitted more than 5,000 rationalization proposals in the third quarter alone, solving many key problems. The promotion of many advanced experiences, such as the rapid steelmaking method, the Hao Jianxiu work method, and the Chen Shulan fine yarn doffing method, played a great role in promoting production. The "double steel feeding method" created by Cheng Helong's group at the 101 Steel Plant greatly increased the output of steel rails, saving the country more than 100 billion yuan in the past year.

Some factories and mines in the Southwest region failed to complete the production and increased production and savings plans because their production management and business management were too backward, which affected the normal progress of production.

### 华东区国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿  去年增产节约六万九千八百多亿元  西南区去年工业生产总值比前年提高百分之九十八

    华东区国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿
    去年增产节约六万九千八百多亿元
    西南区去年工业生产总值比前年提高百分之九十八
    据最近统计，华东区国营、地方国营、公私合营工矿企业一九五二年增产节约总值达六万九千八百四十三亿元，超过预定计划近一倍。
    华东各厂矿增产节约运动是在民主改革和“三反”运动的基础上，以贯彻生产改革为中心内容，以推广先进经验和开展合理化建议为基本环节，有计划有步骤地展开的。去年六月开始，华东各厂矿企业进行了生产改革，首先是安全卫生大检查。上海市第一批一百八十三个工厂的职工群众，在安全卫生大检查中提出改善安全卫生工作的意见就有四十六万多条。根据这些意见，各工厂企业都大大改善了安全卫生和工人的劳动条件，为完成增产节约计划提供了有利的条件。接着，华东区大部分厂矿又进行了生产管理民主大检查，改进了管理机构和劳动组织，调整了工资，进行了生产能力的查定。这些工作，使各厂矿的生产效能提高了一倍到四倍以上。如国营上海虬江机器厂经过上述各项改革以后，全厂的生产能力提高三倍到四倍，等于新建了三、四个同等规模的机器厂。华东纺织管理局所属上海各纺织厂在劳动竞赛的基础上，进行了工时改革和工资改革，明确了以减少断头率为不断提高纺织业生产的关键后，推广、巩固和创造先进经验有了明确的方向，纱布的产量大大提高，因而完成了一万五千四百亿元的增产节约任务，上缴国家的利润也比原订计划增加了百分之三十以上。
    在超额完成去年增产节约计划的基础上，华东区国营、地方国营和公私合营工矿企业现已初步提出比一九五二年实际产量增加百分之三十的一九五三年生产计划，并准备制造大批新的产品和优等质量的产品来支援全国大规模的经济建设。

    西南区国营和地方国营工业除少数工厂矿山外已在去年年底超额百分之十二完成了一九五二年的全年生产计划，同时也完成了全年增产节约计划。一九五二年西南区工业的生产总值比一九五一年提高了百分之九十八。各种主要产品的成本一般都降低了。如钢轨成本比一九五一年降低了百分之二十九。
    西南区国营和地方国营工业完成计划的主要原因，是经过一系列政治运动后，工人阶级觉悟普遍提高，生产热情十分高涨。特别是在“三反”运动中，西南区工厂矿山企业坚决执行了“‘三反’和生产两不误”的方针，在生产上取得了很大的成就。去年七月以后，西南广大工人在高涨的政治热情基础上，深入展开了全区性的生产竞赛运动，并坚决克服了保守思想，进一步修订了增产节约计划。在去年第四季度，许多工厂矿山还开展了生产改革，进一步地改进了生产管理和经营管理，推进了生产竞赛运动。
    西南区国营和地方国营工业完成计划的另一重要原因，是由于大多数工厂矿山在生产竞赛运动中比较注意了改善职工的福利与安全，开展了保安大检查；特别注意了挖掘潜力、找窍门、提合理化建议、总结与推广先进经验。一零一钢铁厂职工只第三季度就提出合理化建议五千多件，解决了许多关键问题。许多先进经验，如快速炼钢法，郝建秀工作法，陈树兰细纱落纱工作法的推广对生产起了很大的推动作用。一零一钢铁厂程和龙小组创造的“双钢喂钢法”，大大提高了钢轨产量，在过去一年中为国家节约了一千多亿元。
    西南区有些工厂矿山没有完成生产和增产节约计划，是因为生产管理和经营管理太落后，影响了生产的正常进行。    　（新华社）
