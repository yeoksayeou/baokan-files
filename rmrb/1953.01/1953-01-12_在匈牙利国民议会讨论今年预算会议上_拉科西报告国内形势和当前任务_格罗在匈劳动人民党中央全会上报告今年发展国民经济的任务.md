Xinhua News Agency: According to news published in the eleventh issue of "Hungarian News," issued by the Embassy of the Hungarian People's Republic in China: At the meeting of the Hungarian People's Republic's National Assembly on December 15, 1952, to discuss the 1953 budget, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mátyás Rákosi delivered a report.

After analyzing the international situation, Rákosi emphasized that the 1953 national revenue budget is 52.739 billion forints (Hungarian currency), which is almost 10 billion forints more than the 1952 fiscal year. Hungary's budget has no deficit, and revenue exceeds expenditure by 875 million forints. Moreover, the purchasing power of the forint has remained stable. Rákosi said: By January 20, 1953, we will have paid off the reparations to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union generously waived a large part of the reparations and extended the repayment period for the remaining reparations from six to eight years. At the same time, thanks to the Soviet Union's friendly and selfless assistance, we have been able to victoriously accelerate the construction of socialism. In the past eleven months of this year (1952, same below), our industrial production has greatly developed. Compared with last year (1951, same below), our coal production increased by 22.2 percent, bauxite production increased by 58 percent, crude oil production increased by 18.4 percent, aluminum production increased by 16.2 percent, steel production increased by 14.1 percent, and electricity production increased by 20.3 percent. Compared with 1951, our total industrial output will increase by 22 percent this year. Our coal production overfulfilled the expanded plan, producing 3.2 million tons more than last year; next year (1953, same below) it will increase by 4.6 million tons compared to 1951. The production of other basic materials is also similar. On a per capita basis, the amount of coal obtained per person has doubled compared to 1938. At the same time, although the coal mines in the United Kingdom have not been damaged by the war, they have not yet reached the level of 1938. The coal mine industry in West Germany is only below 75 percent of the level of the last year before the war. We have 40 percent more coal per capita than France. The growth of the industry producing means of production is much faster than the increase in the production of consumer goods, and the ratio between the two will be 60 to 40 in 1953. In 1938, an average factory had only 91 workers, but now it has 525. The development of industry in various states is also very significant. In 1938, 62.3 percent of manufacturing workers were concentrated in Budapest, but now this number has dropped to 36.7 percent. Next year, we will increase industrial output by 16 percent. The amount of coal production increased in these two years is more than the total coal production in 1939. Next year, our production of steel, crude oil, and aluminum will increase by 25 to 51 percent. A prerequisite for achieving these significant achievements is regular production. The development of our economic life requires us to establish new government departments. We must pay special attention to large factories manufacturing export products to ensure they complete their production plans. Due to the drought, we have reduced agricultural exports and imported feed. To ensure the import of raw materials and machinery, we must export industrial products to make up for the shortfall.

Next, Rákosi reminded everyone of the importance of adhering to planned discipline. He said: Hungary needs to increase 146,000 workers next year, while in the United Kingdom, 100,000 people migrated abroad in the first half of this year because they had no jobs. Rákosi also said: "When we summarize these achievements, we must gratefully remember the multifaceted friendly assistance given to us by the Soviet Union. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union is an inexhaustible treasure and an invaluable help. In addition, the constantly developing mutual assistance between the people's democratic countries is also a very significant and increasingly important help to our economy."

Rákosi then spoke about the development of Hungarian agriculture. He said: In Yugoslavia, drought and frost have become disasters, and famine has impoverished thousands of farmers; but in our country of the working people, despite the bad weather, we have prepared everything in advance for the development of the national economy. We have reduced the export of grain, imported feed from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and reduced the collection of corn and potatoes, thereby improving the situation of the working farmers. We issued agricultural loans, gave farmers millions of forints to buy seeds, and guaranteed the country's food supply. We must better use agricultural technology. The German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia have achieved better results than us by adhering to the principles of agricultural technology. Our livestock has increased, and the current task is to carefully conserve all our feed. This year, production cooperatives have greatly developed, with 658 new ones added, currently totaling 5,315, covering 33.8 percent of the total cultivated land. State-owned farms cultivate 13.7 percent of the country's cultivated land. Production cooperatives and state-owned farms cultivate a total of 37.4 percent of the country's cultivated land. The number of pigs in production cooperatives has increased more than elevenfold since 1950, cattle have increased nearly eightfold, and sheep have increased nearly sevenfold. The number of villages and towns with production cooperatives has increased from 489 to 665 this year. Next year, the number of various tractors at agricultural machinery stations will double, and the number of combine harvesters will triple. Currently, the area of ​​irrigated land is six times that of pre-war, and next year, the area of ​​irrigated land will increase by 56 percent. By the end of November, working farmers had completed 99 percent of the wheat delivery quota.

After explaining the significance of thrift, Rákosi said: The development of our public health is very rapid. Compared with 1938, the birth rate has increased by 47 percent this year per thousand people. The number of marriages per thousand people has increased by 20 percent. The infant mortality rate has been reduced to half of that in 1938. The tuberculosis mortality rate has been reduced by 57 percent compared to 1938. Calculated per thousand population, we have more hospital beds than France or Belgium. Our national education has greatly developed. This year, there are 100,000 students in eight-year public schools. Adult schools equivalent to eight-year schools established for the working people have 30,000 students. The number of middle school students is 119,000. In addition, there are 19,300 working people studying in adult middle school classes. Universities have 46,000 students, and the number of correspondence students exceeds 3,000. In the Horthy era, there were only sixteen college students for every 10,000 residents. This October, the number of college students increased to fifty-one per 10,000 people. We far exceed the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria in this regard. Our Academy of Sciences has made a five-year plan. There are currently 1,640 regional cultural palaces and 2,426 rural areas with cinemas. Rural theaters performed in 3,025 rural areas. A total of 3.4 million working farmers participated in the "Winter Nights of the Free Homeland" program. The number of libraries nationwide has increased to 16,000 to 17,000, roughly one library for every six hundred people. This year, cinemas had a total audience of 85 million people, and the number of people going to the theater increased by 42 percent compared to last year.

Rákosi emphasized: Our most important tasks are as follows: develop our economic strength, resolutely implement the discipline of planning, pay special attention to the production of basic materials and metallurgy, increase our production cooperatives, fight for thrift, strengthen leadership, develop culture, education, and public health, consolidate people's discipline and national order, consolidate national defense, improve political awareness and promote patriotism, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen ties with the peace camp, and strengthen the front of the peace struggle. Finally, Rákosi reminded everyone to work hard, strive to defend peace, and strengthen proletarian internationalism, so as not to be unworthy of the name of a revolutionary shock brigade.

According to news published in the same issue of "Hungarian News": At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party on November 29, 1952, Ernő Gerő, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat, delivered a report on the development of Hungary's national economy in 1952 and the tasks of developing the national economy in 1953. In his report, Gerő pointed out the tasks for the end of 1952 and 1953 as follows:
    1. We must ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the 1952 industrial production plan;
    2. We must ensure that industrial production continues to increase continuously. The industrial production in January 1953 must increase in all aspects compared with the last month of 1952, especially coal mining and metallurgy;
    3. We must concentrate greater efforts than in 1952 to accelerate the development of basic materials industries, such as coal mining, metallurgy, and electricity, and rapidly complete the various industrial construction projects that have already begun according to plan;
    4. The work of the machine manufacturing industry is related to our infrastructure construction and export tasks, but the work of some factories is not satisfactory and must be thoroughly improved;
    5. In agriculture, we must victoriously complete the autumn work and better prepare for the spring work of 1953;
    6. For the development of the entire agriculture and the socialist construction of agriculture, our central task is to increase the harvest of agricultural products and improve the breeding of livestock;
    7. In order to eliminate the adverse consequences of the poor agricultural harvest in 1952 and to generally develop our national economy, we must eradicate waste in all aspects of our lives and practice thrift;
    8. In coal mines, metallurgy, the largest machine manufacturing plants, collective farms, and state-owned farms, we must vigorously strengthen the economic leadership of the Party and the state, and accelerate the technical education of economic cadres and Party cadres.

These are our main tasks. Completing these tasks will promote the socialist construction of our country, which is also our most effective contribution to strengthening the great world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    在匈牙利国民议会讨论今年预算会议上
    拉科西报告国内形势和当前任务
    格罗在匈劳动人民党中央全会上报告今年发展国民经济的任务
    【新华社讯】据匈牙利人民共和国驻我国大使馆发行的“匈牙利新闻”第十一期刊载的消息：在匈牙利人民共和国国民议会一九五二年十二月十五日讨论一九五三年预算的会议上，部长会议主席马蒂亚希·拉科西作了报告。
    拉科西在分析国际形势之后着重指出：一九五三年国家岁入预算是五百二十七亿三千九百万福林（匈币），这比一九五二年会计年度几乎要多一百亿福林。匈牙利的预算没有赤字，而且，收入要比支出多八亿七千五百万福林。而福林的购买力一直是稳定的。拉科西说：到一九五三年一月二十日我们就要付清给苏联的赔款了。苏联曾慷慨地免除了赔款的一大部分，并且把偿还其余赔款的期限由六年延展到八年。同时由于苏联的友好无私的援助，我们得以胜利地加速建设社会主义。在今年（一九五二年，下同）过去十一个月中，我们的工业生产有了很大的发展。和去年（一九五一年，下同）相较，我们的煤产量提高了百分之二十二·二，铁矾土产量提高百分之五十八，原油产量提高百分之十八·四，铝产量提高百分之十六·二，钢产量提高百分之十四·一，电力产量提高百分之二○·三。和一九五一年相较，今年我国工业总产量将提高百分之二十二。我们的煤产量超额完成扩大了的计划，比去年多生产了三百二十万吨；明年（一九五三年，下同）将比一九五一年增加四百六十万吨。其他基本材料的生产也是这样的。按人口计算，平均每人所得的煤量比一九三八年增加了两倍，同时，英国的煤矿虽未受战争的破坏，却还没有达到一九三八年的水平。西德的煤矿工业只是战前最后一年水平的百分之七十五以下。我们每人平均所得煤量比法国的多百分之四十。制造生产资料工业的增长比消费品生产的增加迅速得多，一九五三年两者的比例将是六十比四十。一九三八年平均每个工厂只有九十一个工人，现在已有五百二十五人了。各州工业的发展也是很显著的，一九三八年制造工业的工人有百分之六十二·三是集中在布达佩斯，现在这个数目降低到百分之三十六·七了。明年，我们要把工业产量提高百分之十六。今年明年两年产煤量增加的数量比一九三九年全部的产煤量还要多些。明年我们的钢、原油、铝的产量将要增加百分之二十五到五十一。获得这些意义重大的成绩的一个先决条件是有规律地进行生产。我们经济生活的发展使我们必须设立新的政府部门。我们必须特别注意制造输出品的大工厂，使之完成生产计划。由于天旱的原因，我们减少了农业输出品，并且输入饲料。为了保证原料及机器的输入，我们必须输出工业产品来填补不足。
    接着，拉科西提醒大家注意遵守计划纪律的重要性。他说：明年匈牙利需要增加十四万六千工人，而在英国，在今年上半年有十万人因为没有工作而迁徙到外国去。拉科西又说：“当我们总结这些成就的时候，我们必须感激地记着苏联所给我们的多方面的友好援助。苏联先进经验是取之不尽的宝藏，是难以估价的帮助。此外，各人民民主国家之间不断地发展着的互助，对于我们的经济也是极有意义的日益重要的帮助。”
    拉科西随后谈到匈牙利农业的发展。他说：在南斯拉夫，天旱和降霜成为灾难，饥荒使成千上万的农民穷困了；但在我们劳动人民的国家，尽管天时不好，可是我们事先为国民经济的发展准备了一切。我们减少了粮食的输出，从苏联及其他兄弟国家输入饲料，减低了玉米和马铃薯的收集量，因而改善了劳动农民的处境。我们发放农业贷款，给农民数百万福林购买种籽，并且保证了全国的粮食。我们必须更好地运用农业技术。德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克由于坚持农业技术的原则，因而获得了比我们更好的成就。我们的牲畜增加了，目前的任务是好好地节约我们所有的饲料。今年生产合作社有了很大的发展，新增加了六百五十八个，目前共有五千三百十五个，耕地面积占全部耕地的百分之三十三·八。国营农场则耕种着全国耕地的百分之十三·七。生产合作社和国营农场一共耕种全国耕地的百分之三十七·四。生产合作社的猪自一九五○年以来增加了十一倍多，牛增加将近八倍，绵羊增加接近七倍。我们有生产合作社的村镇的数目今年从四百八十九个增加到六百六十五个。明年，在农业机器站上的各种拖拉机的数目将增加到两倍，联合机将增加到三倍。目前我们灌溉的田地的面积是战前的六倍，明年，受灌溉的田地面积将增加百分之五十六。十一月底，劳动农民完成了缴纳小麦量的百分之九十九。
    拉科西在说明了节约的意义之后说：我国公共卫生的发展是很迅速的，和一九三八年比较，今年一千个人当中，出生率增加了百分之四十七。每千人中，结婚人数增加了百分之二○。婴儿死亡率降低到一九三八年的一半。结核病死亡率比一九三八年减少了百分之五十七。按每一千人口计算，我们的医院病床比法国或比利时都多。我们国民教育有了很大的发展，今年八年制公立学校有十万个学生。为劳动人民设立的相当于八年制学校的成人学校有三万学生。中学生人数是十一万九千，此外，在中学成人班里有一万九千三百个劳动人民在学习。大学有四万六千学生，函授学生人数在三千以上。在霍尔梯时代，每一万个居民中仅有十六个大学生，今年十月，每一万人中大学生增加到五十一个，我们在这一点上远远地超过了英国、法国、荷兰、瑞士及奥国。我们的科学院作出了五年计划。全国现有一千六百四十个地区文化宫，二千四百二十六个农村有了电影院。农村剧院在三千零二十五个农村里作了演出。共有三百四十万劳动农民参加了“自由国土的冬夜”的节目。全国图书馆数目增加到一万六千到一万七千，大约差不多六百人就有一个图书馆。今年电影院的观众共有八千五百万人，到剧院看戏的人比去年增加了百分之四十二。
    拉科西着重说：我们最重要的任务如下：发展我们的经济力量，坚决地执行关于计划的纪律，特别注重基本材料和冶金的生产问题，增加我们的生产合作社，为节约而斗争，加强领导，发展文化、教育及公共卫生，巩固人民的纪律和国家的秩序，巩固国防，提高政治觉悟和发扬爱国主义，加强工农联盟，加强与和平阵营的联系，加强和平斗争的阵线。最后拉科西提起注意，必须努力工作，努力保卫和平并加强无产阶级的国际主义，这样才不愧一个革命突击队的名称。
    据“匈牙利新闻”同期刊载消息：在一九五二年十一月二十九日匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议上，政治局委员兼书记处书记埃诺·格罗作了关于匈牙利一九五二年国民经济发展情况和一九五三年发展国民经济的任务的报告。格罗在报告中指出一九五二年年底和一九五三年的任务如下：一、必须保证一九五二年度工业生产计划的完成与超额完成；
    二、必须保证工业生产继续不断地提高。一九五三年一月的工业生产在各方面都要比一九五二年最后一个月有所增加，尤其是采煤及冶金；
    三、我们必须比一九五二年集中更大的力量来加速基本材料工业的发展，如采煤、冶金、电力，并按照计划迅速完成已经开始了的各种工业建设；
    四、机器制造工业的工作，关系着我们的基本建设和输出任务，但是有些厂的工作不能令人满意，必须彻底加以改善；
    五、在农业方面，我们必须胜利地完成秋季的工作，更好地准备一九五三年的春季工作；
    六、为了整个农业的发展和农业的社会主义建设，我们的中心工作是增加农产品的收获及增进牲畜的饲养；
    七、为了消除一九五二年由于农产歉收而产生的不良结果，并普遍地发展我们的国民经济，我们必须根除我国生活各方面的浪费，并厉行节约；
    八、在煤矿、冶金、最大的机器制造厂、集体农庄及国营农场，我们要大力加强党和国家在经济上的领导，加速经济干部及党的干部的技术教育。
    这些就是我们的主要任务，完成这些任务，就会促进我国的社会主义建设，也就是我们对于加强以苏联为首的伟大的世界和平阵营的最有效的贡献。
