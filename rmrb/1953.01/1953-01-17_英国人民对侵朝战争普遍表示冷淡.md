    British People Generally Indifferent to the War of Aggression Against Korea

    According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 15th, "The vast majority of British people consider the Korean War to be an American war." Although the current Conservative government and the previous Labor government, like lackeys, followed the orders of their American masters and "have tried to draw people's attention to the Korean issue," they have still not changed this situation. The news also mentioned the British "Commonwealth Division" participating in the war of aggression against Korea, saying that "this division is truly a forgotten army. The most concerning question in most people's minds is what it has been doing in Korea for so long."

    The British people's general indifference to the war of aggression against Korea not only strikes a blow to the British reactionary ruling clique, which is keen on selling itself out, but also, as UPI admits, forces Eisenhower to consider this "unpleasant but undeniable" "fact" when "establishing his foreign policy."

### 英国人民对侵朝战争普遍表示冷淡

    英国人民对侵朝战争普遍表示冷淡
    据美国合众社十五日发自伦敦的消息说，“绝对大多数英国人认为朝鲜战争是美国人的战争”。虽然英国现任的保守党政府和前任的工党政府奴才似地奉行美国主子的命令“都曾经努力使人民注意朝鲜问题”，也依然没有改变这种情况。这一则消息还提到参加侵朝战争的英国的“联邦师”，说“这一师军队是名副其实的被人遗忘了的军队。大多数的人民心中最关心的问题是它在朝鲜这么久是在作什么”。
    英国人民对侵朝战争普遍表示冷淡，不仅打击了热中于卖身投靠的英国反动统治集团，而且也正如合众社所承认的，艾森豪威尔“在确立他的外交政策时”，也不得不考虑一下这一个“不愉快的但是也是无可争辩的”“事实”。
