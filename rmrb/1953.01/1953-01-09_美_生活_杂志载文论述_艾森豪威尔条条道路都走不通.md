Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The American "Life" magazine, which has close ties with the monopoly capital groups that supported Eisenhower's rise to power, published an article by Charles Murphy on December 1st last year, discussing the "military way out" facing Eisenhower. This article revealed the anxious mood of the American ruling group as it ran out of options.

In his article, Murphy argued that the Korean War had bogged down a large number of American troops. He said that the American forces currently in Korea, or those used to support them, accounted for more than 30 percent of the U.S. Army's "combat-ready" military strength, at least one-fifth of the Air Force's combat power, and a large portion of the Navy's strength. After using such a large force to fight for more than two years on the small Korean Peninsula, and after paying a heavy price in casualties, the result was only a "stalemate."

Murphy believed that Eisenhower might take five "military ways out" to break this "stalemate," but he believed that none of these five ways would work.

The first way out is for the U.S. military to "immediately withdraw from Korea." Murphy said that this is "an unthinkable thing." Anyone can see that if the United States wants to avoid suffering a greater defeat in Korea, this is the only way out, but the American monopolists refuse to stop the war and withdraw their troops from Korea, lest they lose such a situation that can stimulate arms production.

Murphy said that the second way out is to transfer the war to the Syngman Rhee puppet army as soon as possible. However, the staff of this army "has never had experience in managing the army," it still has to rely on the fire support of the U.S. military, and its air force "can only make the weakest gestures." Therefore, if the Rhee puppet army is allowed to fight alone, the result will inevitably be the "collapse" of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang.

The third way out is to "attempt a breakthrough to advance to the shorter defense line across the narrow 'waist' of Korea." But Murphy said that breaking through the defensive positions of the Korean and Chinese People's forces "may cost the Eighth Army 25,000 to 40,000 casualties." Moreover, he said: "Unless the Chinese army is defeated in a compression war, reaching this line will still not mean winning the war."

Then how about "advancing to the Yalu River"? Murphy believed that this offensive would shorten the transportation lines of the Korean and Chinese sides and lengthen the transportation lines of the U.S. military. He said: "Moreover, the most serious problem is: the battle line here is four hundred and fifty miles wide. This will not end the stalemate."

The last resort: "Expand the war to the Chinese mainland." This is also not feasible. Murphy said, "Any plan to bring the war to Red China would immediately cause the most intricate diplomatic and military problems. Such a plan could plunge the North Atlantic Alliance into a state of great division. Moreover, if we divert more of our military resources to the Far East, ... it would dangerously, even fatally, affect the strategic deployment currently being planned for building the defense of Western Europe." Moreover, even at the risk of such danger, China could never be subdued. Murphy admitted that "history does not provide any basis for optimism that China can be made to surrender by simply applying a little pressure."

Then what about using the Kuomintang bandit troops in Taiwan? Murphy believes that starting up this small group of bandits "will not substantially improve the prospects for any large-scale mainland operations. Their size is too small to be a sustained fighting force."

Use the navy to blockade China! Murphy admitted that this would not scare China either, because China does not rely on maritime transportation, so "naval power has little opportunity to implement a blockade system." If a blockade is imposed on the interior of China, large-scale air force activities will be required, but Murphy admitted that the U.S. Air Force, which has already been frightened in Korea, has "little enthusiasm" for this. Moreover, even under the most favorable circumstances, this air force activity would exhaust the U.S. strategic air force.

With all five roads blocked, Murphy had to play his last card - using the atomic bomb. But Murphy also believed that "the dangers involved are appalling." While Eisenhower and his gang of bandits are actively arranging and clamoring to prolong and expand the Korean War, Murphy carefully calculated for Eisenhower, and the final conclusion is: "All the ways out in the Korean issue - things are obvious - are serious in nature. No road is without danger, and no road does not involve extremely complicated situations."

### 美“生活”杂志载文论述  艾森豪威尔条条道路都走不通

    美“生活”杂志载文论述
    艾森豪威尔条条道路都走不通
    【新华社八日讯】与支持艾森豪威尔上台的垄断资本集团有密切关系美国的“生活”杂志，在去年十二月一日发表了却尔斯·墨菲的一篇文章，论述艾森豪威尔面临的“军事出路”，这篇文章透露了美国统治集团走头无路的焦急心情。
    墨菲在他的文章中认为朝鲜战争拖住了美国的大量兵力，他说，目前美国在朝鲜的力量或用作支援他们的力量，占了美国陆军“有作战准备的”军力的百分之三十强，空军战斗力的至少五分之一，和海军力量的一大部分。使用了这么大的兵力，在小小的朝鲜半岛上打了两年多，付出了重大的伤亡，结果只得到了一个“僵局”。
    墨菲认为艾森豪威尔为了打开这个“僵局”可能采取五条“军事出路”，可是他认为这五条出路一条都走不通。
    第一条出路是美国军队“马上撤离朝鲜”，墨菲说，这是“一件不可想像的事”。谁都可以看得出来，美国如果要想避免在朝鲜遭遇更大的失败，这是唯一的一条出路，但是美国的垄断资本家们却不肯停止战争，把军队撤出朝鲜，以免丧失这么一个能够刺激军火生产的局面。
    墨菲说，第二条出路是尽速把战争移交给李承晚伪军。但是这支军队的参谋部“向来没有管理军队的经验”，它仍然要依靠美军的炮火支援，它的空军“只能作最微弱的姿态”。因此，如果让李伪军单独作战，其结果必然是李承晚匪帮的“崩溃”。
    第三条出路是“试图突破，以推进到横跨朝鲜狭窄‘腰’部的那条较短的防线上去”。但是墨菲说，要突破朝中人民部队的防御阵地，“可能使第八军付出二万五千名至四万名伤亡的代价”。而且，他说：“除非中国军队在一次压缩战中便被击溃，否则到达这条战线仍然不会意味着赢得战争”。
    那么“向鸭绿江推进”又怎样呢？墨菲认为这种进攻将会缩短朝中方面的交通线而拉长美军的交通线。他说：“而且，最严重的问题是：这里的战线有四百五十哩宽。这将不能结束僵局。”
    最后一着：“把战争扩大到中国大陆上去”。这也是一样行不通。墨菲说，“把战争带给红色中国的任何计划会立刻引起最最错综复杂的外交问题和军事问题。这种计划可能使北大西洋联盟陷入巨大的分裂状态。而且，如果把我们的军事资源更多地挪用到远东方面去，……便会危险地、甚至致命地影响目前为建立西欧防务而策划的战略部署。”而且，即使冒着这样的危险，也决不能使中国屈服。墨菲承认，“历史上并没有提供什么根据可以使人乐观地认为，只要略施压力，便能使中国人投降。”
    那么，使用台湾的国民党匪军又如何呢？墨菲认为，起用这一小撮匪徒，“在实质上不会改善任何大规模大陆作战的前景。他们的规模太小了，不能作持久的战斗”。
    用海军封锁中国吧！墨菲承认，这也吓不倒中国，因为中国并不依赖海上交通，所以“海军力量很少有机会去施行封锁制度”。如果对中国内部施行封锁，就需要进行大规模空军活动，可是墨菲承认，已经在朝鲜被打得心惊胆战的美国空军却对这一点“很少表示热情”。而且，即便在最有利的情况下，这种空军活动也会将美国的战略空军消耗净尽。
    五条路都走不通，墨菲只好打出最后一张牌——使用原子弹。但是墨菲也认为这张牌“所牵涉的危险是可怕的”。 当艾森豪威尔及其同伙匪徒正在积极布置并大声叫嚣延长并扩大朝鲜战争的时候，墨菲为艾森豪威尔周密地盘算了一番，最后的结论是：“在朝鲜问题上的所有各条出路——事情是明显的——都是性质严重的。没有一条路不带有危险，没有一条不牵涉到极其复杂的情况。”
