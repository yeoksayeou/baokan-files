Lin Qixiang, a technician in the true air furnace workshop of Shenyang Smelting Plant, summarized and improved the workers' operational experiences to derive a relatively complete advanced operational method of "High Airflow Slag Fast Copper Smelting Method," which made the direct recovery rate of the backward true air furnace copper smelting approach the level of the Soviet mechanized converter. Before implementing this method, the copper recovery rate in the workshop was only 82% to 85%. Now, the direct recovery rate of copper smelting in many furnaces in the workshop has reached over 90%, exceeding the highest level during the puppet Manchurian regime by more than 20%. At the same time, the smelting time has been shortened by about 25% compared to before the implementation of this method.

The "High Airflow Slag Fast Copper Smelting Method" is an example of the combination of workers' labor creation and technicians' scientific theory. Lin Qixiang delved into the workshop for more than two months to understand the entire operation process. He first carefully observed the operation at each stage from charging to discharging copper, and at the same time, paid special attention to the operations of the fourth, fifth, and sixth groups, which had better production results. However, after observing dozens of furnaces, he only felt that the operation methods of each group were chaotic and could not see any obvious differences. Therefore, he adopted a new method, using various ways to talk and hold meetings with workers with good production results, asking them to talk about how they operate themselves, and then, according to the operation principle of the converter, conduct research, analysis, and comparison to find out advanced experience. At the meetings, he often tried to let the workers with relatively poor production results speak first, so that the experienced workers would naturally put forward different opinions to prove the rationality of their own operations. This method played a great role in discovering advanced experience among the workers. For example, Zhang Maozeng, a worker in the fourth group, used to turn on the air and add heavy oil to burn the empty furnace for a while before feeding the furnace, but some people criticized him for this practice as wrong. Because once a furnace was too hot, and when the copper matte was poured into the furnace, it sprayed out immediately, like pouring cold dishes into a frying pan, almost causing a burn accident. However, Zhang Maozeng insisted that his method was correct. This time, when Lin Qixiang summarized the advanced experience, it aroused controversy again. After theoretical analysis, Lin Qixiang made a conclusion on Zhang Maozeng's operation method. He believed that Zhang Maozeng's practice was reasonable, as long as the temperature was controlled according to the melting situation in the furnace to prevent it from being too high, the copper matte would not spray out.

When summarizing the operation methods, Lin Qixiang not only paid attention to discovering advanced experience, but also paid attention to discarding some unscientific parts that coexisted with advanced experience. For example, when Zhen Deshan of the sixth group increased the furnace temperature, he installed the tuyere and oil pipe closer to the bottom of the furnace, which could increase the temperature faster. However, Zhen Deshan was afraid that the material would bury the tuyere, so he raised the tuyere as the material increased, which increased the labor intensity. The fourth group raised the tuyere after feeding the material. When Lin Qixiang summarized, he absorbed the advantages of Zhen Deshan's handling of the tuyere and discarded the disadvantages of his handling of the tuyere. As a result, the past few operation procedures can be concentrated into the time of feeding, greatly shortening the operation process.

Lin Qixiang was very serious about the summary work. For an operational experience, he had to conduct research from both practical effects and technical theory before affirming that it was an advanced operational experience. After the "High Airflow Slag Fast Copper Smelting Method" was summarized and officially named by the leadership as operating regulations, Lin Qixiang was not complacent. He continued to pay attention to discovering new problems so that he could supplement and correct them at any time.

In this way, Lin Qixiang went deep into the masses, relied on the workers, and gradually summarized the advanced operational experience scattered among the workers bit by bit, from not knowing what advanced experience was, and gradually integrated it into a relatively complete "High Airflow Slag Fast Copper Smelting Method," which greatly improved production efficiency and made the old-fashioned equipment approach the level of mechanized converters in operation.

The emergence of the "High Airflow Slag Fast Copper Smelting Method" powerfully criticized the one-sided "pursuit of perfection and pursuit of greatness" ideology of some leading cadres in factories and mines in Northeast China in summarizing advanced experience. Since the launch of the increased production and conservation movement in some factories and mines in Northeast China, workers have made many technical creations, but the leadership has done very poorly in timely summarizing and improving these creations, especially the thousands of small creations; what they want to summarize is the advanced experience that "makes a splash." Some leaders, while shouting loudly to summarize the "key" advanced experience, in fact turn a blind eye to the many "key" technical improvements that have already appeared, and the rationalization proposals sent by workers are left unattended on the desk. Some factories have not summarized experience even once in two or three years in order to wait for the appearance of "big" advanced experience. The true air furnace workshop of Shenyang Smelting Plant has also not discovered "big" advanced experience for two years and five months. Lin Qixiang's successful summary of the "High Airflow Slag Fast Copper Smelting Method" this time once again provides a correct method for summarizing workers' advanced experience.

### 林其梖总结出“大风流渣快速炼铜法”  使真吹炉炼铜的直接实收率接近苏联机械化转炉的水平

    林其梖总结出“大风流渣快速炼铜法”
    使真吹炉炼铜的直接实收率接近苏联机械化转炉的水平
    沈阳冶炼厂真吹炉车间技术人员林其梖，把工人们的点滴操作经验加以总结和提高，得出比较完整的“大风流渣快速炼铜法”的先进操作方法，使落后的真吹炉炼铜的直接实收率接近了苏联机械化转炉的水平。在实行这个操作法以前，该车间铜的实收率只有百分之八十二到八十五，现在该车间很多炉子的炼铜的直接实收率已达到百分之九十以上，超过伪满统治时期最高水平百分之二十强。同时，冶炼时间也比实行这个操作法以前缩短了百分之二十五左右。
    “大风流渣快速炼铜法”是工人的劳动创造和技术人员的科学理论相结合的范例。林其梖在两个多月中，深入到车间了解整个操作过程。他首先仔细地观察了从进料到出铜的每个环节上的操作，同时特别留心生产成绩较好的第四、五、六三个小组的操作。但是观察了数十炉，只感到各组操作方法乱糟糟的，看不出明显的差别。于是他采取了新的方法，用各种方式找生产成绩好的工人谈话、开会，让他们说出他们自己怎样地进行操作，然后再根据转炉的操作原理，进行研究、分析和比较，找出先进的经验。在会议上他常常设法让生产成绩比较差些的工人先发言，使经验丰富的工人自然地提出不同的意见，证明他自己操作的合理的地方。这个办法，对发掘工人中的先进经验起了很大作用。如第四小组工人张茂增，过去往炉子进料以前，先要开风，加重油，把空炉子烧上一阵，但是有人批评他这种作法是错误的。因为以前曾经有一个炉子温度太高，冰铜往炉里猛一倒，好像炒菜时把凉菜倒在煎油锅里一样，马上喷出来，差一点发生烧伤事故。可是张茂增坚持他的方法是正确的。这次，林其梖总结先进经验时又引起了争论，林其梖经过理论上的分析以后，对张茂增的操作方法作了结论。他认为张茂增的作法是有道理的，只要从炉内熔化的情况来控制温度不使过高，冰铜是不会喷出的。
    林其梖在总结操作方法时，不只是注意发掘先进的经验，并且注意抛弃和先进经验同时并存的某些不科学的部分。如第六小组甄德山在提高炉体温度时，把风筒和油管装得离炉底近些，能更快地提高温度。但是，甄德山怕料把风筒埋住，所以随着料的增加提高风筒，这就增加了劳动强度。而第四小组是在进完料以后才提高风筒。林其梖在总结时就吸收了甄德山处理风筒中的优点，抛弃了他处理风筒中的缺点。结果，就可以把过去几道操作程序集中到进料这个时间来做，大大缩短操作过程。
    林其梖对总结工作非常认真。对于一个操作经验，他要从实际效果和技术理论两方面进行研究，然后才肯定它是先进的操作经验。当“大风流渣快速炼铜法”总结出来，并被领导方面正式命名，定为操作规程以后，林其梖没有自满，他仍然在继续注意发现新的问题，以便随时加以补充和修正。
    林其梖就这样深入群众，依靠工人，从不知道什么是先进经验，一直到把分散在工人身上的先进操作经验一点一滴地总结起来，逐渐综合成一套比较完整的“大风流渣快速炼铜法”，使生产效率大大提高，而且使旧式的设备在操作上接近了机械化转炉的水平。
    “大风流渣快速炼铜法”的出现，有力地批驳了目前东北某些厂矿的领导干部在总结先进经验上的片面地“求全、求大”思想。东北某些厂矿自开展增产节约运动以来，工人们的各种技术创造很多，但是领导方面对于这些创造，特别是对千百件小的创造的及时总结和提高却做得非常之差；他们想总结的是“一鸣惊人”的先进经验。有的领导人虽然大喊大叫地要总结“关键性”的先进经验，但是事实上却对那些已经出现的许多带有“关键性”的技术改进熟视无睹，工人们送去的合理化建议放在办公桌上无人过问。有些工厂为了等待“大”的先进经验的出现，甚至在两三年内都没有总结过一次经验。沈阳冶炼厂真吹炉车间，也有二年零五个月没有发现过“大”的先进经验。林其梖这次总结“大风流渣快速炼铜法”的成功，再次提供了一个总结工人先进经验的正确方法。（综合新华社稿）
