    The Fighting Path of the Polish United Workers' Party
    January 28th marks the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the Polish Workers' Party, the predecessor of the Polish United Workers' Party.
    Eleven years ago, in January 1942, Hitler's invading army had occupied Poland, carrying out barbaric fascist rule; the Polish bourgeoisie, represented by the Sanacja ruling group, had betrayed the Polish homeland; and the broad masses of Polish working people, inspired by the heroic fighting of the Soviet Red Army, were resisting the Hitler bandits and domestic reactionaries. At that time, there was an urgent need for a force to unite, organize, and lead the masses in this struggle, a revolutionary party loyal to the proletariat and the people that could undertake this task. In this situation, Polish communists and other truly democratic elements who fought for the liberation of the people and society established the Polish Workers' Party.
    After its establishment, the Polish Workers' Party linked the struggle for national liberation with the struggle for social liberation. In the first militant declaration issued by the Party Central Committee to the Polish people, it put forward the Party's program, which was: to wage an irreconcilable armed struggle against the occupiers and a struggle for national liberation, to organically link this struggle with the struggle for social liberation led by the working class headed by the Polish Workers' Party, and to rely on the fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union. The Party also believed that a victorious struggle could not be waged without implementing Lenin's slogan of a worker-peasant alliance. The Polish Workers' Party always adhered to these basic principles. It became the only party capable of mobilizing the masses to wage a victorious struggle against the Hitler invaders. The Party created the people's armed forces, the "People's Guard" and later the People's Army, and the Party Central Committee decided at the time that every Party member must be a soldier of the People's Guard. The Party also exposed the traitorous proposition of "lay down your arms and wait for the opportunity to act" put forward by the Polish bourgeois London government-in-exile. In a declaration issued to the Polish people in September 1942, the Party once again exposed the treacherous policies of the reactionaries in the government-in-exile, saying: In the face of war, they collude with Hitler. We must act today, we must coordinate with the Red Army. Today, the fate of the Polish people is no longer in the hands of the masters, but in the hands of the working people.
    In 1943, the Soviet Red Army continued its victorious offensive, and the fascist invaders and Polish reactionaries intensified their terrorist activities. At the same time, with the victory of the Soviet army, more and more people began to side with the patriotic movement, the working class, and the Polish Workers' Party. The guerrilla warfare of the People's Guard also expanded. In a declaration issued by the Party in November 1943, it put forward the following program: to wage a struggle against the invaders and Polish fascists, to strive for a people's democratic Poland; to implement land reform in the liberated Poland; to nationalize large and medium-sized industries; to fight for the Polish land along the Oder-Neisse rivers and the Baltic coast; and to maintain a strong alliance with the Soviet Union.
    Faced with the prospect of Poland's imminent liberation and the task of leading the masses to seize power, the Party led the masses in establishing a broad national united front organization—the Provisional People's Representative Council headed by Comrade Bolesław Bierut—at the end of 1943 and the beginning of 1944. This marked the beginning of a new stage in the history of the struggle of the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish people. However, it was on this issue that the right-leaning opportunist and nationalist stance of a group of party members surrounding Gomulka (then the secretary of the Party Central Committee) was revealed. Gomulka and his group betrayed Marxism-Leninism and, at a time when it was necessary to isolate the big bourgeoisie and landlords, hoped that the Polish government-in-exile, supported by Anglo-American imperialism, would participate in the national united front. They also negated the leadership of the working class, rejected the struggle to seize power, and maintained a bourgeois nationalist stance in their relations with the Soviet Union. They underestimated the revolutionary strength of the working masses and overestimated the reactionary forces. However, due to the firm struggle waged by the Marxist-Leninist core of the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Bierut, against their consistent erroneous stance, the attempts of Gomulka and his group ultimately failed.
    Day after day of struggle proved that the Party's Marxist-Leninist line was the only correct revolutionary line. More and more people participated in the struggle for the liberation of the motherland and for a people's democratic Poland. On July 22, 1944, under the victorious advance of the Soviet army, the first worker-peasant government in Polish history—the Polish Committee of National Liberation led by the Polish Workers' Party—was born in Lublin, Poland. The Workers' Party and the Committee of National Liberation launched activities to crush the resistance of the landlords and the sabotage of the reactionaries, and to implement revolutionary land reform.
    After the Soviet Red Army, in coordination with the Polish people's armed forces, liberated the entire country of Poland, the Polish Workers' Party held its first congress in December 1945. The congress approved the Party's policies during the occupation and determined the Party's policies after liberation: to strengthen the people's democratic system and the worker-peasant alliance, to implement revolutionary and democratic social and economic reforms, and to wage a resolute struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries. Under the leadership of the Party, the Polish people's government gradually implemented land reform and the nationalization of large and medium-sized industries, banks, etc. These measures thoroughly打击打 the reactionaries headed by Mikołajczyk, the representative of the bourgeois and landlord classes. In these sharp class struggles, after the Anglo-American imperialists failed to create a civil war through the reactionary Mikołajczyk's Peasant Party and the right wing of the Socialist Party, and after hidden bandits and spies were continuously eliminated, they placed their bet on Gomulka. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party in August 1948, Comrade Bierut once again exposed Gomulka's insidious Titoist ideas, which were anti-Soviet and anti-Marxist-Leninist, dealt a fatal blow to the right-leaning nationalist tendencies within the Party, and laid the foundation for the ideological unity of the Polish working-class movement. At the end of 1948, the unified thinking of the Polish workers' movement for more than 60 years reached its highest point, and on December 15, 1948, the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party merged on the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism. The party after the merger is today's Polish United Workers' Party.
    The Polish United Workers' Party, under the guidance of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, inherited the fighting tradition of the Polish working class for decades in the struggle for social and national liberation, and grew up in the relentless struggle against right-leaning opportunism and nationalism and against the reactionaries. Comrade Bierut said: "The great contribution of the Polish Workers' Party lies in carrying the long-term selfless struggle of the Polish people to a victorious end." The Polish United Workers' Party led the Polish people to victoriously establish a people's democratic system, smash the attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies, and wage a victorious struggle for the three-year plan for the national economy to heal the wounds of war. At present, the Polish United Workers' Party is continuing to consolidate the people's democratic system and lead the people to struggle to realize the six-year plan to lay the foundation for socialism and to strive for peace and the happiness of the Polish people.

    波兰统一工人党的战斗道路
    一月二十八日是波兰统一工人党的前身——波兰工人党成立十一周年纪念日。
    十一年前，一九四二年一月的时候，希特勒侵略军已侵占了波兰，在波兰进行野蛮的法西斯统治；以萨纳奇统治集团为代表的波兰资产阶级已背叛了波兰祖国；波兰广大的劳动人民在苏联红军英勇战斗的鼓舞下，对希特勒匪徒和国内反动派进行着抵抗。当时，迫切需要一个团结、组织和领导群众进行这个斗争的力量，一个能够担当这个任务的忠于无产者和人民的革命政党。在这种情况下，波兰共产党人和其他为人民和社会解放而斗争的真正民主分子成立了波兰工人党。
    波兰工人党成立后，就把民族解放斗争和社会解放斗争联系起来。在党中央委员会向波兰人民发出的第一个战斗的宣言中，提出了党的政纲，那便是：对占领者进行不调和的武装斗争和争取民族解放的斗争，把这个斗争和以波兰工人党为首的工人阶级领导的争取社会解放的斗争有机地联系起来，而且要依靠和苏联的兄弟联盟。党还认为不实行列宁的工农联盟的口号，就不能进行胜利的斗争。波兰工人党始终坚持这些基本原则。它成了唯一能够动员群众对希特勒侵略者进行胜利斗争的党。党创立了人民的武装“人民近卫军”以及后来的人民军，当时党中央还决定每个党员都必须是人民近卫军的战士。党并揭穿了波兰资产阶级伦敦流亡政府提出的“放下武器，待机而动”这一叛逆主张。一九四二年九月党向波兰人民发表的宣言中再度揭露流亡政府反动派的叛卖政策说：在战争面前，他们却和希特勒勾结。我们必须今天就行动起来，我们必须和红军协同动作。今天，波兰人民的命运，已经不是握在主子们的手里，而是握在劳动人民的手里了。
    一九四三年，苏联红军继续胜利进攻，法西斯侵略者和波兰反动派加紧恐怖活动。同时，随着苏联军队的胜利，愈来愈多的人民群众开始站到爱国运动、工人阶级和波兰工人党一边来了。人民近卫军的游击战也扩大了。一九四三年十一月党发表的宣言中提出了这样的纲领：进行反对侵略者和波兰法西斯分子的斗争、争取人民民主的波兰；在解放了的波兰实行土地改革；把大中工业收归国有；为奥得河—尼斯河以及波罗的海沿岸的波兰土地而斗争；与苏联保持巩固的联盟。
    面临着波兰即将解放的前景和领导群众夺取政权的任务，党在一九四三年底和一九四四年初领导人民群众成立了广泛的全国阵线机构——以波·贝鲁特同志为首的临时人民代表会议。这标志着波兰工人党和波兰人民斗争历史上开始了一个新的阶段。然而，就在这个问题上，围绕在哥穆尔卡（当时党的中央委员会书记）四周的一群党员的右倾机会主义和民族主义的立场显露出来了。哥穆尔卡和他的集团背叛马克思列宁主义，正当这必须孤立大资产阶级和地主的时候，却指望受英美帝国主义支持的波兰流亡政府参加全国阵线。他们还否定工人阶级的领导权、拒绝夺取政权的斗争、在对苏联的关系上保持资产阶级民族主义的立场，他们过低估计劳动群众的革命力量而过高估计反动的力量。但由于以贝鲁特同志为首的党中央委员会中马克思列宁主义核心对他们那一贯的错误立场进行了坚决的斗争，哥穆尔卡和他的集团的这些企图终于失败了。
    一天又一天的斗争证明了党的马克思列宁主义路线是唯一正确的革命路线。越来越多的人民群众参加到争取祖国解放、争取人民民主的波兰的斗争中来。一九四四年七月二十二日，在苏联军队的胜利进军下，波兰历史上第一个工农政府——波兰工人党领导的波兰民族解放委员会在波兰的卢布林诞生了。工人党和民族解放委员会展开了活动，以便粉碎地主的抵抗和反动分子的破坏以及实现革命的土地改革。
    当苏联红军在波兰人民武装的配合下解放了波兰全国以后，在一九四五年十二月，波兰工人党举行了第一届代表大会。大会批准了党在占领时期的政策，并确定了解放后党的政策：加强人民民主制度和工农联盟，实行革命的、民主的社会和经济改革并对国内外反动派作坚决斗争。在党的领导下，波兰人民政权逐步实现了土地改革和大中型工业、银行等的国有化。这些措施彻底地打击了以资产阶级和地主阶级的代表米科拉兹柯为首的反动派。在这些尖锐的阶级斗争中，美英帝国主义者在反动的米科拉兹柯农民党以及社会党右派制造内战失败之后，在暗藏的匪徒和间谍被不断清除之后，又在哥穆尔卡身上下了赌注。一九四八年八月波兰工人党中央委员会全体会议上，贝鲁特同志再度揭露了哥穆尔卡的反苏、反马克思列宁主义的阴险的铁托思想，对党内右倾民族主义的偏向给以致命的打击，并为波兰工人阶级运动打下了思想统一的基础。在一九四八年末，六十多年来的波兰工人运动统一思想达到了最高点，一九四八年十二月十五日波兰工人党和波兰社会党在马克思列宁主义的革命的原则基础上合并了。合并后的党就是今天的波兰统一工人党。
    波兰统一工人党是在马克思列宁主义的原则和苏联共产党的历史经验的指导下，承继波兰工人阶级数十年争取社会和民族解放的战斗传统，对党内右倾机会主义和民族主义、对反动派进行无情的斗争中成长起来的。贝鲁特同志说：“波兰工人党的伟大贡献，就在于把波兰人民长期的忘我的斗争进行到胜利的结束。”波兰统一工人党领导了波兰人民胜利地建立了人民民主制度，粉碎国内外阶级敌人的进攻，为治愈战时创伤的国民经济三年计划进行胜利的斗争。目前，波兰统一工人党正在继续巩固人民民主制度，领导人民为实现奠定社会主义基础的六年计划、争取和平和波兰人民的幸福而斗争。（新华社）
