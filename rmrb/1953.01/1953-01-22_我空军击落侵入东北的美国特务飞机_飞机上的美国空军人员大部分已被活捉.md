Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 21st: A U.S. RB-29 type aircraft that intruded into the airspace of Northeast China on the night of January 12th was shot down by our Air Force units. Most of the pilots on board have been captured.

This U.S. aircraft took off from the U.S. invasion base in Korea – Yokota Air Base in Japan – at 17:30 on the 12th and intruded into our national border from the Andong area at 21:15.

Our Air Force units immediately took off to intercept and destroyed it near the Wulongbei Station, 15 kilometers northwest of Andong.

The RB-29 aircraft was numbered 44-62217. According to the confessions of the captured personnel, it was a converted B-29 bomber used for strategic reconnaissance, dropping special agents, and communication liaison. The aircraft originally belonged to the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force (currently stationed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines) and was transferred to Yokota Air Base in Japan in December 1952, assigned to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron. According to the captured personnel, the main tasks of the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing were "transferring communications" and "psychological warfare."

Fourteen U.S. Air Force personnel parachuted when the aircraft was hit, of whom eleven have been captured alive by us, including: Colonel Arnold Jr, John Knox, military number 1212A, Commander of the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force; Major William H. Baumer, military number AO733786, Operations Officer of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron; Captain Eugene John Vaadi, military number AO825008, Pilot, and eight others. Three died in the crash.

The captured Arnold confessed that he studied at the Randolph Air Force Base flight school in Texas from 1936 to 1937, and in December 1939, he tested a wingless artillery correction aircraft at the Post Point Airfield in Oklahoma. From July 1945 to January 1948, he served as the Deputy Commander of the 2143rd Air Weather Wing, and he has been the Commander of the 581st Wing since July 1951.

In addition to the above-mentioned criminal act of the U.S. Air Force RB-29 type spy plane intruding into our country's airspace to conduct strategic reconnaissance, the U.S. invading Korean Air Force has repeatedly violated our country's Northeast airspace in the past two months and has bombed our Northeast towns on November 28th, December 8th, and December 13th, 1952, causing many deaths and injuries to our residents.

The U.S. aggressors deliberately sabotage negotiations and expand the war. Recently, on the one hand, they have taken the unreasonable action of unilaterally notifying the cancellation of the agreement on the protection of delegation supply vehicles in Panmunjom, attempting to completely break down the negotiations. On the other hand, they continue to constantly violate our country's airspace, kill and injure our people, and openly dispatch spy planes to conduct criminal strategic reconnaissance over Northeast China. The wreckage of the U.S. RB-29 aircraft shot down in Andong and the captured U.S. Air Force personnel are undeniable iron evidence of their intensified encroachment on our country's sacred airspace sovereignty and active preparations to expand the war of aggression against Korea. The entire Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this. The U.S. aggressors must bear full responsibility for their serious crimes.

    我空军击落侵入东北的美国特务飞机
    飞机上的美国空军人员大部分已被活捉
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】一月十二日夜间侵入我国东北上空的一架美国RB—29型飞机被我空军部队击落，机上的飞行员大部已被捕获。
    这架美国飞机在十二日十七时三十分从美国侵朝基地——日本的横田机场起飞，二十一时十五分从安东地区侵入我国国境。
    我国空军部队当即升空迎击，将其击毁于安东西北十五公里的五龙背车站附近。
    这架RB—29型飞机机号为四四—六二二一七，根据俘虏供词，为B—29轰炸机改装，供战略侦察、空投特务和通讯联络之用。该机原属美国第十三航空队五八一空中补给通讯联队（现驻菲律宾克拉克基地），于一九五二年十二月被调至日本横田机场，配属于九十一战略侦察中队。据俘虏供称，五八一空中补给通讯联队的主要任务为“转运通讯”和“心理作战”。
    美国空军人员十四人于该机被击中时跳伞降落，其中十一人已被我生俘，计有：美国第十三航空队五八一空中补给通讯联队上校司令官阿诺德Arnold Jr,John Knox,军号一二一二A；第九十一战略侦察中队少校作战官包莫 Baumer,WilliamH,军号AO七三三七八六；上尉机长维地Vaadi,Eugene John,军号AO八二五○○八等十一人。摔死者三人。
    俘虏阿诺德自供曾于一九三六年至一九三七年在得克萨斯州兰达尔夫基地飞行学校学习，一九三九年十二月在俄克拉何马州波司要点飞行场试验一种无翅炮兵校正机，一九四五年七月到一九四八年一月当二一四三空中气象联队副司令，一九五一年七月任五八一联队司令官至今。
    除上述美国空军RB—29型特务飞机侵入我国领空，进行战略侦察的罪恶行为之外，美国侵朝空军在最近两月来，曾多次侵犯我国东北领空，并曾先后于一九五二年十一月二十八日、十二月八日和十二月十三日对我国东北城镇施行轰炸，以致我国居民死伤多人。
    美国侵略者蓄意破坏谈判，扩大战争，最近竟一方面在板门店采取片面通知取消关于代表团供应车辆不受袭击的协议的横蛮无理行动，企图使谈判完全破裂，另一方面又继续不断侵犯我国领空，杀伤我国人民，同时更公然派遣特务飞机对我国东北进行罪恶的战略侦察。在安东击落的美国RB—29飞机的残骸和被俘的美国空军人员，就是他们加紧侵犯我国的神圣领空主权，积极准备扩大侵朝战争的不容抵赖的铁的罪证。全中国人民对此绝对不能容忍。美国侵略者必须对于他们的严重罪行负起完全的责任。
