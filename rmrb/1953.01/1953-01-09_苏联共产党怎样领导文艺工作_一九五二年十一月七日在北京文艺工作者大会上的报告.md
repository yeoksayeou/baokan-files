Comrade Chulaki, Deputy Chairman of the Arts Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Leader of the Soviet Art Delegation:

    Since the very establishment of the Soviet state, our party and government have been deeply concerned with the cultural life of the people, including artistic endeavors.

    Why does the Soviet socialist state attach such importance to art? Because art is a powerful tool for educating and organizing the broad masses of the people. In a socialist country, art is no longer the entertainment of privileged classes, but a tool to serve the people.

    In the past, the people and their outstanding representatives created many excellent literary and artistic works, but these works were seized by the ruling class and separated from the people. Now that we are building a communist society, our primary task is to enable all the people to understand all the outstanding achievements of the past in art. Communism requires not only a strong and highly developed economic base, but also rich spiritual wealth.

    As early as the beginning of the Soviet state, the great Lenin established the basic principles for the development of progressive art. Lenin once said: "Art belongs to the people; its deepest roots should come from the bottom of the broad masses, and it should be understood and loved by the masses." Lenin's brilliant instruction was of great significance for the subsequent development of Soviet art. This instruction is the foundation of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, and also a weapon for combating bourgeois influences in art.

    The struggle against bourgeois influences in art, and against formalist theories and activities, is of utmost importance. In the early days of the October Revolution, the "theory of pure art" was widely popular. For example, there was a theory at that time that Soviet art had nothing to do with the past artistic heritage, and that a special and unique proletarian art should be created. If we were to follow this theory, we would have to abandon the entire heritage and deprive the people of the countless treasures created by them and their most talented representatives in the past. The Party exposed the bourgeois nature of this leftist theory and removed it from the field of Soviet art.

    There was another "theory" according to which old art should also be put aside. The creators of this theory used leftist rhetoric to conceal their true colors, saying: "Our art is the art of the 20th century. Old art can only be used as historical material and museum material. Now, we should create the art of big cities and big factories. Our music should imitate the noise of factories, and our paintings should use machines as material. Only in this way can it conform to the spirit of industrialization..." Of course, our Party could not allow this kind of "industrialized art" to develop, and could not allow art to depict tall buildings and machines more than people. Our Party has always believed that the task of art is to truthfully reflect the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the people, as well as their attitude towards the surrounding things.

    Some bourgeois art theories cleverly disguise their essence with "revolutionary" rhetoric. For example, one of these theories insists that since Soviet society is permeated with the spirit of internationalism, and since the principles on which Soviet society develops are internationalist principles, then we should encourage the creation of "internationalist" art and resolutely negate "narrow" and "outdated" national characteristics. I would like to talk about this issue in detail.

    Indeed, we follow the principles of internationalism, but we believe that internationalism cannot be achieved by weakening, let alone negating, national foundations, but by enriching and developing these foundations. Every nation has created its own unique national art, and therefore every nation has its own unique contribution to the treasure house of world art. The more widely the national art treasures of various nations are exchanged, the faster the genuine principles of internationalism will triumph, because the principles of internationalism are based on the enrichment and abundance of national art, rather than its impoverishment and elimination.

    In the struggle against harmful theories that hinder the development of Soviet art, the fight against bourgeois formalism is one of the most important tasks. Many composers create works that are less like pleasant music and more like the squeaks and rattles of a poorly oiled machine; many painters create works that can be described as the ravings of a madman; and many writers create works in incomprehensible language that even they themselves cannot explain. The Party cannot turn a blind eye to this situation.

    Similar "works" are still very popular in capitalist countries and are regarded as "masterpieces" representing the advanced achievements of modern art. But in our country, art belongs to the people, and it plays a great role in cultivating the people's interests. Therefore, such "works" cannot be allowed to exist, and the people reject this deformed and decadent art.

    Our Party, in order to meet the spiritual needs of the people, and representing the people, has waged a resolute struggle against all unreasonable phenomena in art, and against all phenomena that tend to collapse and destroy art.

    Therefore, the first thing to do is to unite all the creative forces in the country to establish truly realistic art, the art of the people, the art that reflects real life.

    In the past, these creative forces were scattered in many parallel organizations. And the so-called Proletarian Writers' Association, the Proletarian Composers' Association, and the Proletarian Painters' Association occupied a special position, and they believed that only they could create works that met the requirements of the times. These were very narrow organizations that did not allow the basic masses engaged in creation to participate, insisting that they were not yet ideologically mature. In 1932, the Party Central Committee issued a resolution deciding to abolish these special proletarian organizations and establish broadly based creative associations that could unite all capable literary and art workers in the Soviet Union. Thus, the Writers' Association, the Composers' Association, the Painters' Association, and the Architects' Association were established. The establishment of these associations was of great significance for the future development of Soviet literature and art. From then on, the monopoly of those minority groups on creating modern Soviet art works was abolished, and this matter was warmly supported by the Soviet creative community working under the leadership of the Party.

    However, after the establishment of the new creative organizations, the struggle against bourgeois influences and against the remnants of the old was not relaxed, but was somewhat different in its methods. Among them, the struggle against formalism continued for the longest time. The course of the struggle was as follows: In 1936, "Pravda," the central organ of our Party, published two articles entitled "This is not music, but a cacophony" and "False Ballet," severely criticizing the works of the famous composer Shostakovich, pointing out that his musical works were so strange and noisy, and that his operas and ballets lacked beauty and real life. At the same time, these two articles also pointed out that Shostakovich was indeed a talented composer, but he had embarked on the path of formalism, that is, he was influenced by the bourgeoisie in art and failed to get rid of it in time. At the same time, in the same year (1936), another Soviet composer, Dzerzhinsky, wrote an opera "Quiet Flows the Don," which, although it had many shortcomings, was a realistic and popular work. Thus, two opposing factions of works appeared in the same period. Comparing the two, it is easier to see the characteristics and future of the two factions: one is realistic, popular, and reflects real life, and the other is formalist, subjectivist, and degenerate.

    The former opens up broad prospects for the development of art, while the latter leads art to destruction.

    Due to the appearance of the opera "Quiet Flows the Don," the task of creating Soviet classical opera was put forward to Soviet composers. After fascist Germany treacherously attacked our country, the Soviet people responded to the call of the Party and fought with all their might against the mortal enemy. The Soviet people engaged in creation also participated in this great national struggle with art as a tool, and in this period, they created many patriotic works loved by the people.

    After the end of the Great Patriotic War, the Party promulgated several decisions aimed at overcoming the shortcomings in Soviet literature, art, and film. For example, in 1946, the Party Central Committee passed a decision on the two magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad." These two magazines had published many bad works that violated artistic principles and distorted the life of the Soviet people. The authors of these works did not see the newborn, dominant, and progressive things in the phenomena around them, but were fascinated by those past remnants, and tried their best to seek out deformed and dying things, and believed that this was a true reflection of the life of the Soviet people. These writers locked themselves in their own small world and could only see a little thing on the tip of their noses. They vulgarly distorted Soviet reality. Therefore, the Party turned the spearhead of criticism to this aspect.

    In the same year (1946), the Party Central Committee also passed a decision on the film "The Great Life." This film portrayed the Soviet people as muddleheaded, small, vulgar people engaged in trivial things. It completely failed to see the great labor achievements unique to the Soviet people and their usual heroic behavior.

    The Party once again waged a struggle against distorting reality and against vulgar and narrow views in art.

    In recent years, our Party has more often expressed its opinions on art issues. These opinions clearly constitute the basic principles for the development of Soviet realistic art.

    The Party Central Committee's decision on Muradeli's opera "The Great Friendship" is of particular significance. This opera was performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in the Soviet Union. Taking the criticism of this opera as an example, the Party also raised many basic issues concerning the development of Soviet music. The Party Central Committee pointed out that Soviet artists have still not gotten rid of formalism and are still continuing to create anti-people works that lack true beauty; the Party clearly pointed out that formalism is a bourgeois tendency in art, and formalism will lead art to destruction; finally, the Party Central Committee in this decision further elaborated on the role of classical art heritage in the development of modern Soviet art.

    The decision of the Party Central Committee made formalism suffer a devastating blow not only in music, but also painters, sculptors, writers, and other artists armed with this decision waged a resolute struggle against formalism and contributed all their strength to creating Soviet realistic art.

    In the process of studying, discussing, and understanding this decision, the basic principles for the development of Soviet art were clarified: Soviet art should continue and develop the excellent traditions of classical art, catch up with the level of classical art, and Soviet art should have socialist content and national form.

    The decision of the Party Central Committee greatly invigorated the creative work in literature and art. In recent years, a large number of excellent works loved and praised by the people have been created. It should be especially pointed out that even in places where there were no professional artists not long ago, great achievements have now been made. Facts have proved that the national form of art can fully reflect modern themes.

    Our Party attaches great importance to constantly criticizing individual phenomena in art.

    Last year, "Pravda," the central organ of our Party, published articles criticizing two new operas, because these two operas not only distorted historical authenticity, but also lacked artistry.

    It can be seen from this that the Party cares about and guides the development of Soviet art, points out the correct direction for its development, prevents it from distorting reality and deviating from the correct path, thereby promoting Soviet art to a higher stage of development. This is how the Party leads the development of Soviet art, so that it serves the cause of building a communist society. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联共产党怎样领导文艺工作
    ——一九五二年十一月七日在北京文艺工作者大会上的报告
    苏联部长会议艺术委员会副主席
    苏联艺术工作团领导人
    楚拉基亲爱的同志们：
    自从苏维埃国家刚一成立，我们的党和政府就非常关心人民的文化生活，包括艺术工作在内。
    为什么苏维埃社会主义国家这样重视艺术呢？因为艺术是教育与组织广大人民群众的强有力的工具。在社会主义国家，艺术已不再是特权阶级的娱乐品，而是为人民服务的工具了。
    人民和人民的卓越的代表们过去创作了许多非常优秀的文艺作品，但是这些作品却为统治阶级攫为己有并使其与人民隔离。现在我们正在建设共产主义社会，我们的首要任务就是要使全体人民都能够了解过去在艺术上的一切卓越成就。共产主义不仅是须要建立起强大的高度发展的经济基础，而且还须要有丰富的精神财富。
    还在苏维埃国家成立的初期，伟大的列宁就确定了发展进步艺术的基本原则。列宁曾经说过：“艺术是属于人民的，它的最深的根源，应该来自广大群众的最底层，它应该是为群众所了解和喜爱的。”列宁的这一天才的指示对于此后苏维埃艺术的发展具有重大的意义。这一指示是马克思列宁主义美学的基础，同时也是与艺术上的资产阶级影响进行斗争的武器。
    与艺术上的资产阶级影响以及与形式主义的理论和活动进行斗争，是具有极其重大的意义的。在十月革命的初期，“纯艺术理论”曾经广为流行。例如，那时有这样一种理论，硬说苏维埃艺术和过去的艺术遗产是毫不相干的，应该创造出一种特殊的、与众不同的无产阶级艺术。如果我们要遵从这个理论，那么就必须抛弃全部遗产，使人民丧失他们和他们最有天才的代表过去所创造的无数财富。党揭穿了这一左倾理论的资产阶级本质，并且把它从苏维埃艺术的领域中清除出去了。
    另外还有一种“理论”，根据这种理论，旧艺术也要束之高阁了。这种理论的创造者用一些左倾的言辞来掩饰他们自己的真面目，他们说：“我们的艺术是二十世纪的艺术。旧艺术只能作为历史的材料和博物馆的材料。现在，我们应该创造大城市、大工厂的艺术。我们的音乐应当模仿工厂里的嘈杂声，我们的绘画应当以机器为素材，只有这样，才能符合工业化的精神……”当然，我们党不能够允许这种“工业化的艺术”发展下去，不能使艺术对高楼大厦和机器的描写超过了对人的描写。我们党一向认为，艺术的任务就是真实地反映人民的生活、思想和感情，以及人们对待周围事物的态度。
    资产阶级的某些艺术理论用“革命”的辞藻十分巧妙地掩饰其本质。例如，其中有这样一种理论，硬说：既然苏维埃社会渗透着国际主义的精神，既然苏维埃社会赖以发展的原则是国际主义的原则，那么就应当鼓励创作“国际主义”的艺术，坚决否定“狭隘的”、“陈腐了的”民族的特点。关于这一个问题，我要详细地谈一谈。
    的确，我们是遵循国际主义的原则的，但是，我们认为：国际主义是不能用削弱、更不能用否定民族基础的方式来达到的，而是用丰富和发展这些基础的方式求得实现的。每一个民族都创造了自己的、特有的、民族形式的艺术，因此每一个民族对于世界艺术的宝库都有其特有的贡献。各个民族的民族艺术宝藏交流得越广泛，真正的国际主义原则也就会越快地取得胜利，因为国际主义的原则是以民族艺术的充实和丰富为基础的，而不是使其贫乏与消灭。
    在与阻碍苏维埃艺术发展的有害理论的斗争中，反对资产阶级的形式主义是最主要的任务之一。有很多作曲家创作出来的作品，与其说是一种动听的音乐，不如说是一部没有上好油的机器所发生的吱吱嘎嘎的音响；有很多画家创造出来的作品，可以说是疯人的呓语；有很多作家用令人难以理解的语言创作出来的作品连他们自己也解释不通；对于这种情形，党是不能熟视无睹的。
    类似这样的“作品”，直到目前在各资本主义国家中还很流行，并被当作现代艺术先进成就的“代表作”。但是在我们国家里，艺术是属于人民的，它在培养人民的旨趣方面起着很大的作用。所以，像这类“作品”，是不能容许存在的，人民摒弃了这类畸形的、腐朽的艺术。
    我们党为了满足人民精神上的要求而代表人民与艺术方面的一切不合理的现象、一切使艺术趋于崩溃和毁灭的现象进行了坚决的斗争。
    因此，首先应当把全国的一切创作力量团结起来以建立真正现实主义的艺术、人民的艺术、反映现实生活的艺术。
    过去，这些创作力量分散在许多平行的组织中。而所谓无产阶级作家协会、无产阶级作曲家协会、无产阶级画家协会居于特殊的地位，他们认为，只有他们才能创作出合乎时代要求的作品。这是一些非常狭隘的组织，它们不让从事创作的基本群众参加，硬说他们在思想上还没有成熟。一九三二年党中央发表了决议，决定取消这些特殊的无产阶级组织，并建立能够团结苏联一切有能力的文艺工作者的范围广泛的创作协会。于是便成立了作家协会、作曲家协会、画家协会和建筑家协会。这些协会的成立对于苏联文学艺术日后的发展是具有重大的意义的。从那时起，便取消了那些少数团体对于创作现代苏联艺术作品的垄断权，这件事情得到了在党领导下进行工作的苏联创作界的热烈拥护。
    可是，在建立了新的创作组织之后，反对资产阶级影响、反对旧的残余的斗争，仍未松弛，只不过在方式上多少有些不同。其中尤以反对形式主义的斗争继续的时间最久。斗争的经过是这样：一九三六年我们党的中央机关报——“真理报”发表了以“这不是音乐，而是嘈杂声”和“虚伪的芭蕾舞”为题的两篇文章，严厉地批评了名作曲家萧斯塔科维奇的作品，指出了他的音乐作品是那样的奇奇怪怪而嘈杂，指出了他的歌剧和芭蕾舞的作品中缺乏美和现实生活。同时，在这两篇文章中还指出了萧斯塔科维奇的确是一个天才的作曲家，可是他走上了形式主义的道路，也就是在艺术上受了资产阶级的影响而未能即时摆脱。同时，就在这一年（一九三六年），另外一位苏联作曲家吉尔任兹基写了一部歌剧“静静的顿河”，这部歌剧虽然有不少缺点，但它却是一部现实主义的、人民的作品。于是，在同一时期内就出现了背道而驰的两派作品。把两者比较来看，更能显明地看出两派的特点和前途：一个是现实主义的、人民的、反映现实生活的艺术，另一个是形式主义的、主观主义的、堕落的艺术。
    前者为艺术的发展开辟了广阔的远景，后者使艺术趋于毁灭。
    由于歌剧“静静的顿河”的出现，在苏联作曲家面前提出了创作苏维埃古典歌剧的任务。在法西斯德国背信弃义进攻我国之后，苏联人民响应党的号召，以全力与不共戴天之敌进行了斗争。苏联从事于创作的人们也同样以艺术作为工具参加了这伟大的全民的斗争，在这个时期内创作了很多爱国主义的、为人民所热爱的作品。
    在伟大的卫国战争结束之后，党又公布了几项决定，旨在克服苏联文学、艺术、电影方面的缺点。例如，在一九四六年党中央通过了关于“星”和“列宁格勒”两杂志的决定。这两个杂志曾刊载了许多篇不好的、违反艺术原则的作品，歪曲了苏维埃人民的生活。这些作品的作者在他们周围的现象中没有看到新生的、主导的、进步的东西，对那些过去残余的东西反而津津有味，竭力寻求畸形的、垂死的东西，并且认为这就是苏联人民生活的真实写照。这些作家们把自己关在自己的小天地里，只能看到自己鼻尖上一点小事物。他们庸俗地歪曲了苏联的现实生活。所以党把批评的锋芒转到了这方面来。
    就在这一年（一九四六年），党中央还通过了关于影片“伟大的生活”的决定。这部影片把苏联人民描写成昏头昏脑的、渺小的、庸俗的、从事琐碎事物的人。完全没有看到苏联人民特有的、伟大劳动成果和他们平时的英雄行为。
    党在这一次又进行了反对歪曲现实、反对艺术上的庸俗的狭隘观点的斗争。
    最近几年以来，我们的党更加常常就艺术问题发表意见。这些意见极明确地构成了苏维埃现实主义艺术发展的各项基本原则。
    党中央关于穆拉杰利斯的歌剧“伟大的友谊”的决定，有着特别重大的意义。这个歌剧曾在苏联大剧院上演过。党以批评这个歌剧为例，又提出了关于发展苏联音乐的许多基本的问题。党中央指出苏联的艺术工作者仍然没有摆脱形式主义，还在继续创作反人民的、缺乏真正的美的作品；党明确地指出：形式主义是艺术中的资产阶级倾向，形式主义将会使艺术走向毁灭；最后，党中央在这个决定中对于古典艺术遗产在现代苏维埃艺术的发展上所起的作用的问题，作了进一步的阐述。
    党中央的这个决定，使形式主义不仅在音乐方面遭到毁灭性的打击，而被这个决定所武装起来的画家、雕刻家、文学家及其他艺术工作者都和形式主义进行了坚决的斗争，并把自己的全部力量都贡献于创作苏维埃现实主义艺术。
    在研究、讨论和领会这个决定的过程中，明确了苏维埃艺术发展的基本原则：苏维埃艺术应当继续并发展古典艺术的优良传统，赶上古典艺术的水平，苏维埃艺术应该具有社会主义的内容和民族的形式。
    党中央的决定使得文学、艺术各方面的创作工作大大活跃起来。在最近几年来，创作了大量的得到人民的热爱和称赞的优秀作品。尤其应该指出的是甚至在不久以前还没有任何职业艺术家的地方，现在也获得了很大的成就。事实证明，艺术的民族形式是完全可以体现现代的题材的。
    我们党对于经常批评艺术上的个别现象是非常重视的。
    去年我们党中央机关报——“真理报”发表了批评两部新歌剧的文章，因为这两部歌剧不但歪曲了历史的真实性，并且缺乏艺术性。
    由此可见，党关心并指导着苏维埃艺术的发展，指出它发展的正确方向，防止它歪曲现实和脱离正确的道路，从而促使苏维埃艺术达到更高的发展阶段。党就是这样领导着苏维埃艺术的发展，使它为建设共产主义社会的事业服务。  （新华社）
