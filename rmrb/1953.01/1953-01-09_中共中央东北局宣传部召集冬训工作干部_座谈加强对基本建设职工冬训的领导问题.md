The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau Convenes a Forum of Winter Training Cadres to Strengthen Leadership Over Winter Training for Basic Construction Workers

The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau convened cadres from various provinces and cities directly involved in the winter training of basic construction workers on December 22 and 23, 1952, to report on their work and discuss the main issues in this work.

According to the reports at the forum, most provinces and cities attached great importance to the winter training work. Since the beginning of winter, various regions have actively carried out preparations. Winter training committees have been generally established in various provinces and cities to specifically lead this work, and many regions have also held backbone training classes. However, based on the reports at the forum, there are still two main problems in the winter training work in the Northeast region that urgently need to be resolved: First, the leadership in some areas does not have an accurate understanding of the main ideological situation of basic construction workers and technicians, and it is not clear which ideological problems need to be solved through political education. Therefore, they want to solve all problems and teach all courses during the short winter training period. In particular, the political education of technicians varies from place to place. Some units organize the study of "Three-Anti" documents, some talk about the eight requirements for Party member standards, and some mechanically apply the methods of "ideological construction" in government organs, resulting in very little effect. Second, due to the heavy workload and dispersed leadership, coupled with the fact that various units are not good at closely integrating various tasks and appropriately dividing responsibilities, the specific organization and leadership of winter training work in various units is poor. Specific issues such as teachers, teaching materials, and classrooms have not been completely and appropriately resolved. Some units neglect the quality of teachers and hire them casually. Because the leading organs have not been equipped with a certain number of Party members and Youth League members, the leadership force in the training classes is weak. These situations have slowed the progress of winter training and education, and the enthusiasm of the trainees cannot be quickly stabilized.

Based on the above situation, the following three suggestions were made at the forum regarding winter training work:

First, in order to improve the learning enthusiasm of workers, staff, and technicians and enable them to study with peace of mind, it is still necessary to further explain the purpose and significance of winter training to the trainees and grassroots cadres in light of the specific ideological situation of the employees.

Second, due to the urgency of time, the content of winter training must be more concentrated and streamlined. It is necessary to overcome the rigid method of teaching according to the book without considering the specific ideological situation of the unit. Focus on two or three main ideological problems and conduct more in-depth and systematic class education. In addition to improving the quality of lectures, reports can be organized by advanced figures, and trainees can be generally organized to discuss their own thoughts in light of reality. At the end of the discussion of each issue, a concise summary should be made so that the trainees can grasp the center and strengthen their impressions. Educationally significant films and dramas can be interspersed in political education.

Regarding the political education of technicians, the meeting pointed out that some units should stop mechanically using methods such as "ideological construction" in government organs. It is necessary to help technicians find out the experiences and lessons from summarizing the achievements and shortcomings of the business and technical work of basic construction in 1952, and clarify the idea that relying on the working class and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can do a good job in basic construction, and then conduct political education.

As for the technical education in winter training, it is also required that the content be concentrated and the purpose be clear. Therefore, it should be carried out in the following aspects: First, according to the construction needs in 1953, organize the study of the existing advanced experience of various types of work; according to the engineering tasks in 1953, train the skilled workers needed for various types of work in a planned way; second, study the advanced experience of scientific organization of labor, especially the method of parallel assembly line operations. When conducting technical education, ideological mobilization should also be carried out to explain why it is necessary to learn technology and advanced experience. Regarding the teaching methods of technical education, it is advocated that technicians, advanced producers, and general workers should be combined, teaching, working, and learning simultaneously, and more demonstrations and practical operation exercises should be organized. Some units plan to invite Soviet experts to give technical lessons, which is even better. It is necessary to ensure that advanced experience can be effectively promoted in the winter training class, and every trained worker can truly improve their skills.

The third opinion at the forum was: All provinces and cities should strengthen specific and in-depth organizational leadership. The winter training committees and offices in various regions should generally organize an inspection to solve problems on the spot. The backbone strength of the winter training leading organs and training classes should be appropriately strengthened, and the division of labor in all aspects should be clear. Correct the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing between the trade union and the administration in some units. In order to improve the teaching effect, teachers should be cadres at the department level of the provincial and municipal Party committees and other cadres with higher levels. Learning counselors in training classes should be established as widely as possible. In addition, specific issues such as classrooms, food, and dormitories should be appropriately resolved as much as possible.

Finally, Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that propaganda and mobilization should be done well for the winter training work, explained the importance of strengthening the work of the training class, and pointed out that the main problems should be selected and explained thoroughly in teaching. Comrade Li Zhuoran finally instructed: Training a large number of basic construction talents is a regular task in the future, and it is necessary to carefully summarize the experience of this winter training work.

### 中共中央东北局宣传部召集冬训工作干部  座谈加强对基本建设职工冬训的领导问题

    中共中央东北局宣传部召集冬训工作干部
    座谈加强对基本建设职工冬训的领导问题
    中共中央东北局宣传部于一九五二年十二月二十二、二十三日召集各省、市直接参加基本建设职工冬季训练工作的干部汇报工作，并就这一工作中的主要问题展开了讨论。
    根据座谈会上的汇报，大部分省、市领导上对冬季训练工作都比较重视，入冬以来各地都积极进行了准备工作，各省、市普遍成立了冬季训练委员会，专门领导这一工作，许多地区并办了骨干训练班。但是，从座谈会上汇报的情况看，目前东北区冬季训练工作还有两个主要问题亟待解决：一、有些地方领导上对基本建设工人和技术人员的主要思想情况还了解得不够准确，对于要通过政治教育解决那些思想问题不明确，因此在短短的冬季训练期间什么问题都想解决，什么课都想讲。特别是对技术人员的政治教育，各地做法不一，有的单位组织学习“三反”文件，有的单位讲党员标准八项条件，有的单位机械地搬用机关“思想建设”的方法，以致收效很小。二、由于工作繁多，领导力量分散，再加上各单位不善于把各种工作密切结合起来又适当地分工负责进行，因而各单位对冬季训练工作具体的组织领导较差，教员、教材、教室等具体问题，还没有完全得到适当的解决。有的单位忽视教员的质量，随便聘请教员。由于领导机关没有配备一定数量的党员和青年团员，所以训练班中领导力量薄弱。这些情况使冬季训练教育工作进展很慢，受训学员的情绪不能很快稳定。
    根据上述情况，座谈中对冬季训练工作提出以下三点意见：
    第一，为了提高工人、职员和技术人员的学习情绪，使他们安心学习，现在还应当结合职工的具体思想情况，把冬季训练的目的和意义进一步向学员和基层干部解释清楚。
    第二，由于时间紧迫，冬季训练内容必须更加集中，精简。要克服不结合本单位具体思想情况，机械地照本讲课的生硬方式，应抓住两三个主要思想问题，进行比较深入系统的阶级教育。除提高讲课质量外，还可组织先进人物作报告，结合实际普遍组织受训人员对照自己的思想进行讨论。对每一问题的讨论最后都要做出简明、扼要的总结，以便使学员抓住中心，加强印象。在政治教育中可穿插上富有教育意义的电影、戏剧等项目。
    关于技术人员的政治教育，会上指出某些单位应停止机械搬用机关“思想建设”等方式，要帮助技术人员从总结一九五二年基本建设的业务、技术工作的成绩和缺点中，找出经验教训，明确依靠工人阶级和学习苏联先进经验，才能搞好基本建设的思想，进行政治教育。
    至于冬季训练中的技术教育，也要求内容集中、目的明确，因此应从以下几方面进行：一、根据一九五三年施工需要，组织学习各工种已有的先进经验；按照一九五三年的工程任务，有计划地训练各工种所需要的技术工人；二、学习科学的组织劳动的先进经验，特别是平行流水作业的方法。在进行技术教育时，还应作思想动员，说明为什么要学技术和先进经验。关于技术教育的教学方法，提倡由技术人员、先进生产者与一般工人结合起来，边讲边作边学，多组织表演与实际操作的练习；有的单位计划请苏联专家讲技术课，这就更好。务使先进经验能在冬季训练班切实推广，每一个受训工人真正把技术提高一步。
    座谈中第三个意见是：各省、市应加强具体深入的组织领导。各地冬季训练委员会、办公室应普遍组织一次检查，就地解决问题。要适当地加强冬季训练领导机构和训练班的骨干力量，各方面的分工要明确，纠正有的单位工会和行政互相推诿的现象。为了提高教学效果，教员应由省、市委处长级干部及其他水平较高的干部担任，训练班里的学习辅导员应尽量普遍建立。此外，教室、伙食、宿舍等具体问题，都应尽一切可能加以适当解决。
    最后，中共中央东北局宣传部李卓然部长在会上讲话。他强调应做好冬季训练工作的宣传动员，说明了加强训练班工作的重要性，指出教学方面要选主要的问题讲通。李卓然同志最后指示说：大批地培养基本建设人材，是今后经常性任务，一定要很好地总结这次冬季训练工作的经验。
