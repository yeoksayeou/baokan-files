The Southwest Construction Industry Bureau has specially dispatched more than a dozen technicians to form a research group at the construction site to study and summarize the experience of site management. The working cadres dispatched by the Party organization of the Political Department of the Southwest Construction Industry Bureau have established a construction site branch. The local trade union has established a grassroots trade union at the construction site, and the Southwest Construction Trade Union Working Committee has established a working group at the construction site. The Southwest Construction Industry Bureau has also decided to establish a training class for 300 construction personnel at the construction site, so that trainees can combine theory and practice in the learning process.
    The 501 Experimental Construction Site has established a construction affairs group, a materials group, a tools group, a finance group, a statistics group, a labor and wages group, a general affairs group, and a research group under the leadership of the site director. In order to complete the preparations before construction in an orderly manner, they have formulated a twenty-five-day schedule for construction preparation work. From December 15th of last year to January 10th of this year, within these twenty-five days, they have completed as scheduled the overall layout plan of the construction site, the construction of temporary projects and roads on the site, the organization of the labor force, and have formulated a construction plan of three-zone parallel twenty-one section flow, a supply plan of materials and labor, and seven types of sectional indicator charts. The material reserve work has also been basically completed. River sand and gravel have been prepared, and contracts have been signed with relevant units for steel, cement, and wood. The construction plan and indicator charts were first discussed jointly by the heads of each group at the construction site and the heads of the Party and trade union, then arranged for study among group leaders and general cadres, and then discussed among all workers. Finally, on January 10th of this year, they were formally discussed and decided upon at the construction site workers' representative meeting.

    中央人民政府建筑工程部西南建筑工业管理局成立五零一实验工地，准备在这一工地摸索出一套关于工地行政管理和党与群众工作的经验，用来改进西南全区工地的施工管理和党与群众工作。西南建筑工业管理局专门派了十几个技术人员，在工地成立研究组，研究、总结工地管理的经验。由西南建筑工业管理局政治部党组织派出的工作干部，成立了工地支部。当地工会在工地成立了基层工会，西南建筑工会工作委员会在工地成立了工作组。西南建筑工业管理局并决定在工地成立一个三百人的施工人员训练班，使学员们在学习过程中，能把理论和实践结合起来。
    五零一实验工地在工地主任下设立工务组、材料组、工具组、财务组、统计组、劳动工资组、总务组和研究组。为了有条不紊地完成施工前的准备工作，他们制定了一个二十五天的施工准备工作进度表，从去年十二月十五日到今年一月十日的二十五天中，已如期完成了施工现场全场布置图、工地暂设工程和道路的修建、劳动力的组织，作出了三区平行二十一段流水的施工计划、材料劳动力的供应计划和分工种的指示图表七种。材料储备工作也已基本上完成。河砂、石子已准备好，钢筋、水泥和木材也已和有关单位签订了合同。施工计划和指示图表首先经过工地各组负责人、党和工会负责人的共同讨论，又在小组长和一般干部中布置学习，然后在全体工人中进行讨论，最后在今年一月十日经工地职工代表会议上正式讨论通过并作出决定。这样做，就使全体职工对计划管理树立了明确的观念。（新华社）
