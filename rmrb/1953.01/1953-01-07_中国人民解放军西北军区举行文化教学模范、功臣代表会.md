    The Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a conference of cultural teaching models and meritorious representatives of the entire army at the end of 1952. Since the large-scale cultural learning movement was launched in various units of the Northwest Military Region last June, illiteracy has been basically eliminated throughout the army. According to statistics at the end of October: those whose language level reached the graduation level of senior primary school or junior high school accounted for 20 percent of the total number of troops, those who reached the level of senior primary school accounted for 37 percent, those who were close to the graduation level of junior primary school accounted for 31 percent, and only less than 12 percent of the people continued to carry out crash literacy learning. The development of the cultural learning movement in the whole army has greatly improved the political, cultural level and work efficiency of the troops.
    The conference widely exchanged experiences in cultural teaching in various units through typical reports of various models and meritorious people and cultural teaching achievement exhibitions. These experiences once again show that the People's Liberation Army is an army with high wisdom and creativity. For example, a certain unit created more than 50 kinds of teaching tools in mathematics teaching to help students strengthen their memory, so that the average score of students reached more than 90 points. The experience of many units also proves that strengthening unity and mutual assistance is a powerful guarantee for obtaining excellent results. Many troops promoted the "respect teachers and love students" movement in the cultural learning movement, which not only strengthened the unity between teachers and students, but also strengthened the unity between comrades from workers and peasants and intellectuals.
    At the teaching achievement exhibition, many excellent works created by the soldiers after learning culture were displayed. The autobiographical novel "Selling Son to Repay Debts" by soldier Cui Bawa, the novel "Stories of the Red Army Era" by soldier Wang Dacheng, and the script "Military-Civilian Relations" created by soldier Nan Xueqian are all works with rich content and educational significance.
    The meeting believes that in the future, the cultural learning of various troops should consolidate achievements and move forward steadily, laying a good foundation for learning various scientific knowledge in the future. In teaching work, it is necessary to oppose the "single-handed" style, prevent the tendency of seeking speed without seeking success and damaging the physical strength of commanders and fighters.

    中国人民解放军西北军区举行文化教学模范、功臣代表会
    中国人民解放军西北军区于一九五二年年底举行了全军文化教学模范、功臣代表大会。西北军区各部队从去年六月展开大规模文化学习运动以来，全军已基本上扫除了文盲。据十月底的统计：语文程度达到高小毕业或初中水平的已占全军人数的百分之二十，达到高小程度的占百分之三十七，接近初小毕业程度的占百分之三十一，只有不到百分之十二的人仍在继续进行速成识字学习。全军文化学习运动的展开，大大提高了部队的政治、文化水平和工作效率。
    大会通过各个模范、功臣的典型报告和文化教学成绩展览会，广泛地交流了各部队文化教学的经验。这些经验再次说明了人民解放军是一支具有高度智慧和创造性的军队。如某部在数学教学中就创造了五十多种教学工具帮助学员加强记忆，使学员成绩平均达到了九十分以上。许多单位的经验也证明：加强团结互助是获得优良成绩的有力保证。很多部队在文化学习运动中推行“尊师爱生”运动，不仅加强了师生团结，也加强了工农出身的同志与知识分子之间的团结。
    在教学成绩展览会上，陈列了很多战士们在学习文化后所创作出来的优秀作品。战士崔八娃的自传小说“卖子还账”、战士王大成的小说“红军时代的故事”和战士南学谦创作的剧本“军民关系”等，都是内容丰富很有教育意义的作品。
    会议认为：今后各部队的文化学习，应该巩固成绩，稳步前进，为今后学习各种科学知识打好基础，在教学工作中，必须反对“单打一”的作风，防止求速不求成和损害指挥员战斗员体力的偏向。
