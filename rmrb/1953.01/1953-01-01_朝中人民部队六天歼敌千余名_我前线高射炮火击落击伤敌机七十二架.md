Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 31st: In these six days—from the 20th to the 25th—the frontline Korean-Chinese People's Army actively launched assault activities. In ten larger assault battles, our army annihilated a total of more than four hundred enemies.

On the night of the 21st, our army on the eastern front separately attacked the enemy's positions near the rock cave west of Mundung-ri and near Eo Un-ri, annihilating an enemy platoon in each location within half an hour. On the night of the 22nd, our army raided the enemy's positions near Sata-ri east of Mundung-ri and near Seohi-ri, annihilating more than fifty enemies in total, and destroying two enemy tanks and five vehicles. On the night of the 23rd, our army on the western front, with the cooperation of various artillery fire, strongly attacked the position of a reinforced platoon of the 38th Regiment of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division near Sinhyun-ri west of Cheorwon. After occupying the position, we repelled seven enemy counterattacks, annihilating more than one hundred enemies in total.

Our army's assault battles were all fought very skillfully, often unexpectedly approaching the enemy-held hilltops and wiping out squads and platoons of enemies cleanly in a short period. After suffering losses, the enemy came to retaliate, but each time the attacking enemy was either largely killed or wounded and retreated before approaching our army's positions, or they encountered our army's firepower and fled in panic after climbing the hilltops.

In the six days from December 20th to 25th, our army's frontline mobile artillery fire killed and wounded a total of six hundred and eighty-seven enemy troops; frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down twenty-seven enemy aircraft and damaged forty-five enemy aircraft.

    朝中人民部队六天歼敌千余名
    我前线高射炮火击落击伤敌机七十二架
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】这六天——二十日到二十五日前线朝中人民军队积极展开袭击活动。在十次较大的袭击战中，我军共计歼灭了四百多名敌人。
    二十一日夜里，东线我军分头袭击文登里以西岩洞和渔云里附近敌人的阵地，都在半小时内各歼守敌一个排。二十二日夜里，我军袭入文登里以东沙汰里和西希里附近敌人的阵地，共歼灭敌人五十多名，并击毁敌军坦克二辆、汽车五辆。二十三日夜里，西线我军在各种炮火配合下强袭铁原以西薪岘里附近美军第二师三十八团一个加强排的阵地，在占领阵地后又击退敌人七次反扑，共歼灭敌人一百多人。
    我军的这些袭击战都打得很巧妙，往往出敌不意地摸上敌人据守的山头，在短促的时间内将成班成排的敌人消灭干净。敌人在吃了亏之后，前来报复，但每次来袭击的敌人，不是在接近我军阵地之前被杀伤大部而退回，就是在爬上山头之后遇到我军火力的拦阻而仓皇逃回。
    从十二月二十日至二十五日的六天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军六百八十七名；前线高射炮火共击落敌机二十七架，击伤敌机四十五架。
