Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 24th: This reporter reports on the story of the people of An Dong capturing American Air Force personnel who invaded our country's airspace alive: On the farmlands and mountains from Wu Long Bei to Yu Shu Lin Village in the northwest of An Dong, the wreckage of an American RB-29 special agent plane, shot down by our air force on the night of January 12th, remains. This is a shameful testament to the American aggressors' invasion of our sacred airspace and their conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Korea.

Whether men, women, old, or young, all looked at the wreckage of this American special agent plane with hateful eyes. Wang Qi Shu, a sixty-seven-year-old man, tapped the wreckage with his cane and said angrily, "See if your American bandits' ambitions will die!"

From the confessions of the captured American Air Force personnel, it is known that this special agent plane was hit in three engines when it encountered the counterattack of our air force. When the plane caught fire, Colonel Wing Commander Arnold was so frightened that he just stood trembling at the door of the cabin, delaying the time for parachuting. One of the guys on the same plane was so anxious that he pushed Arnold aside and jumped out first, and the others followed one by one. But when it was the turn of the last three American air bandits to parachute, it was too late, and they fell from the sky and were killed.

This night air battle took place over An Dong to Wu Long Bei. Many local residents heard the sound of aerial shooting and aircraft. When this American special agent plane crashed, militiamen from villages near Wu Long Bei ran around spreading the news, while others picked up their guns and went out to stand guard, blocking the roads in all directions. Old people and women also got up from their beds, and some, without putting on their cotton clothes, rushed to the militia team, asking to join the search for prisoners in the mountains.

All eleven air bandits who parachuted down were captured alive in a short period of time. Some raised their hands as soon as they heard footsteps, some threw their pistols ten meters away and stood with their hands raised, and some turned their gun muzzles upside down and handed them to the people who came to catch them.

When the local women heard that the men were all catching prisoners, they also went out in groups to search. As soon as they left the village entrance, they caught an American air bandit. Cai Xi Hou, the militia platoon leader, led several militiamen to a mountain ridge and found an American devil wandering around there. Cai Xi Hou shouted at him, "Hand over your gun!" The guy immediately raised his hands high. This prisoner was Colonel Commander Arnold of the 581st Air Supply and Communications Wing of the 13th Air Force of the United States.

    活捉美国空中强盗的经过
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】本社记者报道安东人民活捉侵犯我国领空的美国空军人员的经过说：在安东西北五龙背到榆树林村的田畔和山岭上，遗留着在一月十二日夜里被我国空军击毁的一架美国RB二十九型特务飞机的残骸。这是美国侵略者侵犯我国神圣领空、阴谋扩大侵朝战争的可耻的罪证。
    无论男的、女的、老的、小的，都用仇恨的眼光看着这架美国特务飞机的残骸。一个六十七岁的老人王启书用拐杖敲打着残骸愤愤地说：“看你美国强盗野心死不死！”
    从美国空军俘虏的口供里知道：这架特务飞机遇到我国空军的迎击时被打中了三个发动机。当飞机起火时，上校联队司令官阿诺德吓得只是站在机舱门口发抖，延长了跳伞的时间。同机的一个家伙急得推开阿诺德抢先跳出，其他的才一个个跟着跳下来。但轮到后面那三个美国空中强盗跳伞时已经太晚了，他们便从空中掉下来摔死了。
    这次夜间空战是在安东到五龙背的上空进行的。当地有许多居民都听到了空中射击和飞机的声音。当这架美国特务飞机掉下来的时候，五龙背附近村中的民兵们有的跑着互相传告，有的拿起枪来出去站岗，封锁了四面八方的路口。老人、妇女们也都从炕上起来了，有的人没穿好棉衣服就急着跑到民兵队里要求参加搜山捉俘虏。
    跳伞下来的十一个空中强盗在短时间内就被全部活捉了。他们有的一听到脚步声就举起手来，有的把手枪扔出十公尺以外举手站立着，有的把枪口倒过来递给去抓他的人。
    当地妇女们听说男人们都在抓俘虏，便也成群结队地出去搜索，她们刚一出村口便抓到了一个美国空中强盗。民兵分队长蔡喜厚率领几个民兵走到一座山岭上，发现一个美国鬼子正在那里打转。蔡喜厚对着他大喊一声：“缴枪！”那家伙立刻把手高高举起。这个俘虏便是美国第十三航空队五八一空中补给通讯联队上校司令官阿诺德。
