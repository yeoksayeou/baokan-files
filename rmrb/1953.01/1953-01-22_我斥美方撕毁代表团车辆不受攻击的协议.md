Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: Since unilaterally interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations on October 8, 1952, the U.S. side has adopted a series of provocative actions to undermine various administrative agreements related to the Korean armistice negotiations. Recently, the U.S. side has further openly attempted to tear up these administrative agreements related to the armistice negotiations. On January 15th, the U.S. delegation unilaterally claimed that it would abolish the original agreement reached between the two sides on November 25, 1951, regarding the immunity from attack for delegation supply vehicles, effective January 25th. On January 21st, our chief liaison officer, on the order of Chief Delegate General Nam Il, replied to the other side, pointing out that this further provocative action of the other side in unilaterally tearing up the agreement is a planned action by the U.S. side to completely undermine the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations in order to facilitate the expansion of the Korean War. The other side cannot shirk the serious responsibility of unilaterally tearing up the agreement and openly undermining the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations. The full text of our chief liaison officer's reply to the other side is as follows: Colonel Carrock, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command:

    I have received your letter of January 15th.

    On the order of our chief delegate, I am making the following reply to your letter:

    Only because your side insists on pursuing a policy of indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents and peaceful facilities in Korea, and for the benefit of the Korean armistice negotiations, was the understanding between the liaison officers of both sides on November 25, 1951, regarding the immunity of our delegation's supply vehicles from air attack necessary. On October 8, 1952, your side unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations and, moreover, rejected the absolutely fair and reasonable peace proposal made by the Soviet representative at the United Nations General Assembly for an immediate ceasefire in Korea, demonstrating that your side fundamentally does not want to reach a fair and reasonable armistice in Korea, and therefore will not earnestly abide by the various administrative agreements reached between the two sides for the Korean armistice negotiations. In order to deceive the people of the world and evade responsibility for undermining the armistice negotiations, your side has repeatedly proclaimed that the Korean armistice negotiations have not been interrupted, but the facts prove that your side has not only interrupted the Korean armistice negotiations, but also deliberately undermined the administrative foundation of the armistice negotiations. Since October 8, 1952, your military aircraft have constantly violated the airspace over the conference area and the neutral zone, bombing and strafing our delegation's supply vehicles, increasingly seriously undermining the various administrative agreements related to the Korean armistice negotiations. Your unilateral tearing up of the understanding between the liaison officers of both sides regarding the immunity of our delegation's supply vehicles from air attack, that is, announcing a provocative action to intensify the indiscriminate bombing of our delegation's supply vehicles, is a planned action by your side to undermine in practice the various administrative agreements related to the armistice negotiations, and then openly tear up these agreements, in order to finally completely undermine the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations. Although your side has never earnestly abided by this agreement, I still cannot but point out to you the seriousness of your unilateral tearing up of this agreement. This provocative action by your side further exposes your side's mask of deceiving the people of the world, showing your side's determination to undermine the armistice negotiations and expand the Korean War.

    Your side's attempt to describe this agreement, reached by both sides for the benefit of the armistice negotiations, as a so-called "privilege" granted by your side is completely unfounded. Your side should know that once any agreement is reached, unless the agreement itself stipulates otherwise, it is absolutely not permissible for any one party to unilaterally abolish or modify it. Your side cannot use any excuse to shirk your side's serious responsibility for unilaterally tearing up the agreement and openly undermining the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations.

    我斥美方撕毁代表团车辆不受攻击的协议
     【新华社开城二十一日电】美方自一九五二年十月八日片面中断朝鲜停战谈判以来，就采取了一系列的破坏有关朝鲜停战谈判的各项行政协议的挑衅行动，最近美方更进一步地公开企图撕毁这些有关停战谈判的行政协议。一月十五日美方代表团片面声称：将自一月二十五日起废除双方在一九五一年十一月二十五日所达成的关于代表团供应车辆不受攻击的原有协议。一月二十一日我方首席联络官奉首席代表南日将军之命答复对方，指出对方片面撕毁协议的这一进一步的挑衅行动，是美方企图完全破坏朝鲜停战谈判的基础，以便于扩大朝鲜战争的一个有计划的行动。对方决不能推卸片面撕毁协议、公开破坏朝鲜停战谈判基础的严重责任。我方首席联络官致对方复函全文如下：联合国军首席联络官卡洛克上校：
    一月十五日函悉。
    我奉我方首席代表之命，对来函作如下答复：
    只是由于你方坚持对朝鲜和平居民及和平设备进行狂轰滥炸的政策，并为了朝鲜停战谈判的利益，一九五一年十一月二十五日双方联络官关于我方代表团供应车辆不受空中攻击的谅解才有必要。一九五二年十月八日，你方片面中断停战谈判，更在联合国大会上拒绝苏联代表所提在朝鲜立即停火的绝对公平合理的和平建议，显示你方根本不愿在朝鲜达成公平合理的停战，从而也不会切实遵守双方为了朝鲜停战谈判所达成的各项行政协议。为了欺骗世界人民，逃避破坏停战谈判的责任，你方一再宣扬朝鲜停战谈判并未中断，但事实证明，你方不仅中断了朝鲜停战谈判，而且蓄意破坏停战谈判的行政基础。一九五二年十月八日以来，你方军用飞机不断侵犯会场区与中立区上空，轰炸、扫射我方代表团供应车辆，日益严重地破坏着有关朝鲜停战谈判的各项行政协议。你方片面撕毁双方联络官间关于我方代表团供应车辆不受空中攻击的谅解，亦即宣布对我方代表团供应车辆加紧狂轰乱炸的挑衅行动，是你方从实际上破坏有关停战谈判的各项行政协议，进而公开撕毁这些协议，以便最后完全破坏朝鲜停战谈判基础的一个有计划的行动。虽然你方从来没有切实遵守过这一协议，我仍然不能不向你指出你方片面撕毁这一协议的严重性。你方这一挑衅行动进一步揭穿了你方欺骗世界人民的假面具，显示你方决心破坏停战谈判，扩大朝鲜战争。
    你方企图将此项双方为了停战谈判的利益而达成的协议，说成是你方所谓的“特许”，是没有任何根据的。你方应该知道，任何协议，一经达成，除非协议本身对此有所规定，即决不容许任何一方片面予以废除或修改。你方不能用任何借口推卸你方片面撕毁协议，公开破坏朝鲜停战谈判基础的严重责任。
        朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军谈判代表团
                首席联络官朱然上校
                    一九五三年一月二十一日
