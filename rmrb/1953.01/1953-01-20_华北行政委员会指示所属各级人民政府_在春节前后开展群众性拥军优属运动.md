The 1953 Spring Festival is approaching. The North China Administrative Council of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has issued instructions on carrying out Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families work. It requires all urban and rural areas in North China to universally launch a mass support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families movement around the Spring Festival to educate the people, enhance the spirit of patriotism, continue to promote the fine tradition of cherishing revolutionary soldiers, and consolidate and deepen the flesh-and-blood ties between the people and the army. Specific requirements for the following work are:

    I. Before and after the Spring Festival, people's governments at all levels above the district level should conduct a thorough inspection of local preferential treatment work in conjunction with current work. To ensure that the inspection work is effective and can solve practical problems, local military cadres should be invited to participate in the inspection at the village and household levels, focusing on key areas. The focus of the inspection is: the living conditions and production of families of martyrs, military families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, the resettlement of demobilized soldiers, and their difficulties and demands. In cities, the focus is on checking the organization of families of martyrs and military families to participate in production and introduce occupations; in rural areas, the focus is on solving the difficulties of agricultural production for families of martyrs and military families, thoroughly rectifying the substitute farming organizations, helping to make production plans and spring plowing preparations for 1953, and effectively solving their difficulties to ensure that their land yields reach the level of the general public. Inspection methods can include cadre meeting inspections, representative meeting discussions, forums for families of martyrs and military families, and individual visits. In short, it is required to be serious and thorough, resolutely oppose bureaucratism, so as to truly discover problems and solve them thoroughly.

    II. Before the Spring Festival, the people's governments of all counties and cities should distribute preferential military grain in a planned way to help some families of martyrs and military families with particularly difficult lives, and ensure that every family of martyrs and military families can spend the Spring Festival happily. For the daily life difficulties (such as carrying water, collecting firewood, etc.) of elderly, infirm, disabled, and labor-free families of martyrs and military families, the masses should also be mobilized to help solve them effectively.

    III. Governments at all levels should take the initiative to contact local troops and hold various get-together activities during the Spring Festival, hold army-civilian get-together parties, invite military leaders to speak, and invite combat heroes to report on their heroic deeds. At the same time, responsible cadres of the People's Government should also introduce the achievements of various construction projects and the situation of relevant preferential treatment work to the troops, check shortcomings, solicit opinions, and explain improvement methods. Labor models and model families of martyrs and military families should be organized in a planned way to report production achievements and introduce high-yield experiences to the troops, so as to achieve mutual education, mutual encouragement, improve awareness, and enhance unity. According to local customs, various activities such as New Year's greetings and condolences can also be carried out for families of martyrs, military families, the wounded and sick, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and local troops.

    IV. Hold celebration meetings for combat heroes and meritorious people.

    V. Through the above specific work, universally carry out education on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
