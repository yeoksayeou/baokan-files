Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 12th: In order to first guarantee the smooth completion of key national projects, the Southwest Region has, in accordance with the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, implemented unified allocation of important materials.

In the past, construction units purchased materials themselves, resulting in significant waste. For example, some units still have cement purchased in 1951, which has hardened due to moisture; some units have accumulated timber that has rotted, but some units that truly need materials cannot buy them, resulting in work stoppages due to lack of materials. In response to this situation, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee has implemented unified allocation of important materials such as cement and timber.

During the implementation of unified allocation, it was also discovered that the phenomenon of needing units requesting "more" and "sooner" was very common. For example, the application volume of cement and timber for the first quarter of this year exceeded the possible supply by more than double, and two-thirds of this was concentrated in January. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that basic construction units have departmentalism and do not conduct careful calculations. Units with departmentalist thinking always think that cement and timber are in short supply, so they request more and store it up. Some leading cadres of units do not take responsibility for material allocation calculations, allowing subordinates to request from superiors at will. The State-owned 101 Steel Plant applied for 7,000 cubic meters of timber for the first quarter's repair projects. This amount of timber could build 50,000 square meters of houses, requiring 300,000 man-days, and 3,000 people would have to work on repairs every day to use it all. This is obviously too much. In addition, some units' plans have not been carefully made, so they have to estimate. Estimation inevitably leads to overestimation rather than underestimation. In order to prevent the departmentalism of construction units and the economic ignorance of leading cadres from undermining the unified allocation of important construction materials, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee has decided that in the future, the allocation of cement and timber will first satisfy the needs of key construction projects, projects for building railway bridges during the dry season, factory buildings, and major projects related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. At the same time, according to the actual progress of basic construction procedures, priority will be given to meeting the needs of units whose plans have been approved, designs have been completed, and construction is underway; followed by units whose plans have been approved, designs have been completed, and construction can begin in the first quarter; and thirdly, units whose plans have been approved, designs are in progress, and construction can begin in the second quarter. As for construction units whose plans have not been approved and designs are not yet in place, they will not be considered.

    保证国家主要工程顺利完成
    西南区实行重要材料统一调拨
    【新华社重庆十二日电】为了首先保证国家主要工程的顺利完成，西南区已遵照中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会的规定，实行了重要材料的统一调拨。
    过去由各建设单位自行采购材料，浪费很大。如有的单位到现在还积存有一九五一年采购的水泥，这些水泥因受潮而硬化了；有的单位积存的木材已腐朽了，可是有些真正需要材料的单位反而买不到，造成了停工待料现象。针对这种情况，西南财政经济委员会实行了水泥和木材等重要材料的统一调拨。
    在实行统一调拨的过程中，又发现各需材单位“多要”、“先要”的现象十分普遍，如今年第一季水泥和木材的申请数超过可能供给数一倍以上，而其中三分之二又集中在一月份里。产生这种现象的原因，主要是各基本建设单位有本位主义思想和不认真进行计算。有本位主义思想的单位，总以为水泥和木材缺货，多要些，存起来再说。有些单位的领导干部，对材料分配不负责计算，任凭下级向上级要。国营一零一钢铁厂为第一季修缮工程申请的木材就达七千立方公尺。这些木材可造五万平方公尺的房子，要用三十万人工，每天要有三千人做修缮工作才能用完。这显然是多要了。此外，有些单位的计划没有认真做起来，只好估计。估计就不免多估而不少估。为了防止各建设单位的本位主义和领导干部不问经济的偏向破坏重要建筑材料的统一分配，西南财政经济委员会特决定今后水泥和木材的分配，首先满足那些重点建设工程、枯水期间修建铁路桥梁的工程、工厂厂房和有关国计民生的重大工程的需要。同时，根据基本建设程序的实际进度，首先满足那些计划已批准、设计已完成、正在施工的单位的需要；其次是计划已经批准、设计已经完成、第一季可以施工的单位；第三是计划已批准、设计正在进行、第二季可以施工的单位。至于计划未批准、设计没有着落的建设单位，则不予考虑。
