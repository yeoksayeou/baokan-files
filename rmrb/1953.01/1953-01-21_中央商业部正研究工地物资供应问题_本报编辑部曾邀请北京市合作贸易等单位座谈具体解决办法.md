The Central Ministry of Commerce is Studying the Issue of Material Supply for Construction Sites
　　The Editorial Department of This Newspaper Invited Beijing Cooperative Trade and Other Units to Discuss Specific Solutions

　　To the Editor: We have read the reader's letter summary "Cooperative Trade Organizations Should Strengthen Material Supply Work at Construction Sites" published in the "Reader's Letters" section on January 1st.

　　We believe that the workers' demands are reasonable. Cooperative trade organizations should quickly find ways to solve this problem. In order to take care of the lives and health of construction site workers, and to facilitate the large-scale basic construction projects across the country this year, we are now understanding the past situation of material supply at construction sites and contacting the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to study the division of labor and other issues. Soon, we will be able to formulate a more detailed plan and notify all regions to implement it. We hereby reply in advance.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce

　　Editor's Note: In order to specifically study how to solve the problem of material supply for basic construction sites, this newspaper recently invited the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Beijing Department Store Company, Retail Company, Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Beijing Construction Engineering Company Union to discuss solutions.

　　The units present unanimously agreed that everyone has a responsibility to solve this difficulty for basic construction workers, and actively proposed many specific solutions. The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative decided to vigorously develop membership among construction workers and establish distribution agencies in construction sites with larger scales; for construction sites with smaller scales, shorter construction periods, and existing members, the method of mobile supply will be adopted to serve the members. In order to focus on piloting this work, the cooperative has developed more than 2,000 members among more than 10,000 construction workers outside Fuxingmen, and established eight distribution agencies in twenty-two construction worker winter training locations. This has been warmly supported by the worker masses, and the administrative and trade union units have actively provided assistance. They find houses for the distribution agencies if they don't have them, and lend them furniture if they are lacking; some units even voluntarily send people to help the distribution agency's salespersons with their work.

　　The meeting also discussed how state-owned trading departments can combine with cooperatives and appropriately divide labor. The unanimous opinion was that cooperatives can only serve members, and it is impossible for all workers at construction sites to join cooperatives, which determines that state-owned trading departments must participate in this work. Representatives from Beijing Department Store Company and Retail Company expressed that they are willing to do so for the sake of the country's large-scale basic construction: setting up distribution points in areas where construction sites are more concentrated; and providing mobile supply to more scattered construction sites. However, they raised a noteworthy practical problem, which is that the current needs of construction site workers are diverse. Workers not only need food and cloth, but also vegetables, fruits, and other daily necessities. Due to the limitations of their business scope, no single professional company can independently meet the comprehensive needs of the workers. If each company separately establishes distribution organizations at construction sites or in work areas, it will inevitably lead to duplication of organizations and waste of personnel. Therefore, the representatives present all believed that in order to adapt to the characteristics of suburban construction sites, in order to meet the needs of workers in many aspects, and in order to avoid duplication of organizations and waste, it is appropriate to establish a unified trade organization with a broader business scope at the construction site. This organization can be jointly formed by various professional companies, or a professional company can be designated to concurrently manage the material supply work of other companies. However, whether this method can be piloted or promoted, we hope that the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee and the Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce will study and reply to us.

    中央商业部正研究工地物资供应问题
    本报编辑部曾邀请北京市合作贸易等单位座谈具体解决办法
    编辑同志：一月一日“读者来信专页”所载“合作贸易机构应加强工地物资供应工作”的读者来信综述，我们已经看到了。
    我们认为工人同志的要求是合乎情理的。合作贸易机构应当赶快设法解决这个问题。为了照顾建筑工地工人的生活和健康，以有利于今年全国各地大规模基本建设工程的进行，现在我们正在了解过去工地物资供应的情况，并与全国合作总社联系研究组织分工等问题。不久以后，我们当可订出一个比较详细的办法，通知各地执行。特此先复。
                        中央人民政府商业部
    编者按：为了具体研究如何解决基本建设工地的物资供应问题，日前，本报特邀请北京市人民政府工商局、北京市百货公司、零售公司、北京市供销合作总社和北京市建筑工程公司工会等单位座谈解决办法。
    到会各单位一致认为，大家都有责任来为基本建设工人解决这个困难，并积极提出了许多具体的解决办法。北京市供销合作总社决定大力在建筑工人中发展社员，在建筑规模较大的工地中建立分销机构；对建筑规模较小、工期较短、而又有社员的工地，则采用流动供应的办法来为社员服务。该社为了重点试行这个工作，已在复兴门外的一万多建筑工人中发展了二千多社员，在二十二个建筑工人冬训处建立了八处分销机构。这样做，得到了工人群众的热烈拥护，各单位行政和工会也积极给以帮助。没有房子，他们给找；缺少家具，他们给借；有的单位甚至自动派人帮助分销处业务员工作。
    至于国营贸易部门怎样和合作社结合而又恰当分工的问题，会上也进行了研究。大家一致的意见是：合作社只能为社员服务，而建筑工地的工人不可能全部加入合作社，这就决定了国营贸易部门必须参加这个工作。北京市百货公司和零售公司等单位代表都表示：为了祖国大规模的基本建设，他们都乐于这样作：在工地比较集中的地方，设立分销处；对比较零散的工地进行流动供应。但他们却提出了一个值得注意的实际问题，这就是：目前建筑工地工人的需要是多种多样的，工人们不仅需要食粮和布匹，而且需要菜蔬、水果和其他日用百货。各专业公司因限于经营范围，任何一个单位都不能单独地满足工人的全面要求。假若各个公司都分别到工地或到工区去建立分销组织，又必然造成机构重复和人员浪费等现象。因此，到会各代表都认为：为了适应郊区工地的特点，为了能够多方面地满足工人的要求，为了避免机构重复和浪费现象，在工地宜于建立一个经营范围较广的统一的贸易机构。这一个机构，可由各专业公司联合组成；也可指定一个专业公司兼营其他公司的物资供应工作。但这个办法可否试行或推广，希望北京市人民政府财政经济委员会和中央人民政府商业部研究并答复我们。
