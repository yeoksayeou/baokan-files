    Two Articles on Fedoseyev
    Suslov

    Editor's Note: Fedoseyev was the editor-in-chief of the CPSU Central Committee's journal "Bolshevik." He was precisely the kind of person who, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, viewed the laws of social development from a subjective idealist standpoint, denied the objective nature of the laws of political economy under the socialist system, and vigorously promoted this non-Marxist viewpoint through the "Bolshevik" magazine. Therefore, he was dismissed in July 1949.

    After the publication of Comrade Stalin's new work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Fedoseyev published two articles in the "Izvestia" on December 12th and 21st last year to elaborate on Comrade Stalin's work. However, he made no mention or review of his past mistakes. Therefore, Comrade Suslov has written this article to point out his incorrect attitude towards the serious mistakes he committed. This is also of great educational significance for our ideological workers.

    Two articles by Fedoseyev were published in "Izvestia": "On the Objective Nature of the Laws of Social Development" and "On the Interconnection of the Laws of Social Development." These two articles expounded Stalin's new classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," explained in detail the principles of the objective nature of natural and social laws, and reiterated Comrade Stalin's devastating criticism of some subjectivist and other pseudo-scientific concepts regarding the nature of socialist economic laws.

    Following Comrade Stalin's instructions, the author justly stated in the article published on December 12th of this year, "Among some philosophers and economists, until recently, there was an incorrect, non-Marxist concept of the laws of social development under the socialist system: that is, denying the objective nature of these laws... Some economists and philosophers believe that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the decisive force in social development is not the economy, not the base, but politics. This view is essentially a revival of Dühring's idealist theory." In the same article, the author concluded: "Subjectivist interpretations of the laws of socialist development bring serious damage to the practice of Marxism and communist construction."

    The author's exposition and discussion themselves do not raise objections. However, when it comes to Fedoseyev's articles, one cannot help but think of the question: Why does he think it is possible not to talk about his own mistakes, when he himself enthusiastically propagated this idealist and subjectivist view of the nature of socialist economic laws in the past? Naturally, Fedoseyev's attitude towards his mistakes cannot but surprise the readers of these two articles.

    As everyone knows, before the appearance of Comrade Stalin's new work, a large number of Soviet economists and philosophers were precisely in a state of extreme confusion on the question of the nature and role of socialist economic laws, mainly due to the subjectivist and voluntarist interpretations of socialist economic laws. These economists and philosophers believed that the Soviet state could, according to its own will, use its economic plans and various policies to "transform," "formulate," "create," and "eliminate" the economic laws of socialist society.

    Comrade Stalin exposed the complete error and harmfulness of this viewpoint, which completely violated Marxism and turned to a subjective idealist position.

    Comrade Stalin's comprehensive demonstration of the objective nature of economic laws in socialist society is a remarkable contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism, and this demonstration provides a strict scientific basis for socialist political economy. Comrade Stalin consistently defended and developed the most important principle of dialectical materialism regarding the objective nature of natural and social laws. He pointed out with exceptional clarity that the laws of socialist political economy are also objective laws that reflect the laws of economic life processes that do not depend on people's will, and therefore cannot be "created" or "abolished" according to the will of the state.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out what would happen if the existence of objective laws in the economic life under the socialist system were denied. He wrote:

    "This would plunge us into the realm of confusion and chance, make us slaves to these chances, deprive us of the possibility not only of understanding things, but simply of groping our way in this chaos of chance.

    "This would mean the liquidation of political economy as a science, because science cannot exist and develop without recognition of objective laws, without studying these laws. By liquidating science, we would be unable to foresee the course of events in the economic life of the country, i.e., we would be unable to do even the most elementary economic leadership work." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," People's Publishing House, p. 78)

    The voluntarist and idealist arguments propagated by some Soviet economists and philosophers on the nature of economic laws in socialist society seriously hindered the scientific study of socialist political economy and the theoretical synthesis of practical issues in our socialist construction, and caused damage to the education of party, Soviet, and scientific cadres.

    It should be pointed out that in spreading this subjective view on the problems of socialist political economy, which runs counter to Marxism, the magazines "Economic Problems," "Planned Economy," and "Bolshevik," etc., played a bad role at that time. For example, the "Bolshevik" magazine, during the years when Comrade Fedoseyev was the editor-in-chief, not only did not expose the subjective ideas in the field of socialist political economy, but also used its pages to promote these incorrect views.

    The magazine lavishly praised Voznesensky's anti-Marxist book "The Soviet War Economy During the Patriotic War," calling it a recent scientific achievement, treating it as a "valuable contribution to Soviet economic science," and as a scientific reference book "that seems to help our Soviet, Party, and scientific cadres to understand the laws of socialist society development more completely and deeply" (see "Bolshevik," 1948, No. 1, pp. 71, 88). In fact, Voznesensky's book confused the study of socialist political economy issues. This book is a mixture that views the role of the plan and the state in Soviet society from a voluntarist point of view while idolizing the law of value—believing that the law of value seems to be the regulator of labor allocation among various sectors of the Soviet national economy.

    When Fedoseyev was the editor-in-chief of "Bolshevik," some staff members of the editorial department were so convinced of the "Marxism" in Voznesensky's anti-Marxist book that they quoted it extensively in the magazine, and even used this anti-Party method: adding the original text of Voznesensky's book to articles written by authors who did not want to regard this book as a source of knowledge.

    In the articles by Kursky, Sorokin, Gatovsky, Konakov, and others, the "Bolshevik" magazine systematically promoted the view that the socialist plan seems to be the economic law of Soviet society as an indisputable and self-evident principle. But what does this mean? In essence, this means promoting that false, subjectivist viewpoint in the field of socialist political economy. If the economic plan is the economic law of Soviet society, created by the socialist state, then there would be a conclusion: that our state is the creator of the economic laws of Soviet society.

    During Fedoseyev's tenure as editor-in-chief, the authors of some articles published in the "Bolshevik" magazine, based on this non-Marxist view of the laws of the socialist economy, declared that the policies of the Communist Party and the socialist state are the main objects of socialist political economy. For example, Konakov asserted in an article published in the 11th issue of "Bolshevik" in 1948 that "studying the decisive and leading role of the Bolshevik Party and the socialist state's policies in the development of the Soviet economy on the road to communism should be the foundation for scientifically exploring the laws of the socialist national economy" (see p. 68).

    Therefore, Comrade Fedoseyev committed many mistakes in front of the Party. Through the "Bolshevik" magazine, he promoted the spread of those views on socialist political economy that were incompatible with Marxism, causing damage to the education of party, Soviet, and scientific cadres. That is why Fedoseyev's two articles, which did not mention his own mistakes, cannot but cause surprise.

    Has Comrade Fedoseyev forgotten these mistakes?

    In view of Comrade Fedoseyev's astonishing forgetfulness, it is appropriate to recall the July 13, 1949, resolution of the CPSU Central Committee "On the 'Bolshevik' Magazine." We quote the full text of this resolution here:

    "It must be admitted that the 'Bolshevik' magazine is not run satisfactorily, and the current editorial board of the magazine is also not performing its tasks well.

    "The 'Bolshevik' magazine has become detached from the practice of socialist construction. The editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine has not raised or studied some urgent issues in Marxist-Leninist theory, especially those related to the transition from socialism to communism. The magazine is limited to explaining the most common, well-known principles, avoiding in-depth analysis and summarization of new facts. The editorial board did not summarize the experience of the Party's struggle to restore and further develop the national economy.

    "The editorial board has not well explained international life issues, especially the issues of the international workers' movement. The growing forces of socialism and democracy worldwide are weakly represented in the magazine, and the significant achievements of the people's democratic countries in laying the foundations for the transition to socialism are not reflected.

    "The editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine is detached from the life of the Party, does not study and summarize the work of local Party organizations, and does not raise issues in Party life and Party building.

    "The editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine does not contact Party organizations in its work, but relies on a small group of authors who monopolize the magazine. The editorial department uses impermissible working methods: adding new words and sentences that completely change the content of the articles received by the magazine without notifying the original authors. This fact is a gross distortion of the Bolshevik press tradition.

    "The editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine committed serious mistakes, using the magazine's pages to flatter and praise Voznesensky's book 'The Soviet War Economy During the Patriotic War,' groundlessly touting it as a textbook and a 'profound scientific research work.' The editorial staff of the 'Bolshevik' magazine reached such a degree of sycophancy that they even quoted words from Voznesensky's book in the authors' articles against the wishes of some authors.

    "The CPSU Central Committee hereby decides:

    1. In view of the lack of guaranteed due leadership of the 'Bolshevik' magazine and incorrect working methods, Comrade Fedoseyev is removed from the post of editor-in-chief of the 'Bolshevik' magazine and given a warning.

    Comrades Alexandrov and Yovchuk are removed from the position of members of the editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine.

    Comrades Gatovsky and Koshelev are relieved of their work in the 'Bolshevik' magazine.

    2. The members of the editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine are determined to be Comrades Abalin (editor-in-chief), Ilyichev, Pospelov, Krushkov, Grigoryan, Myasnikov, and Bulkov (editorial secretary).

    3. The editorial board of the 'Bolshevik' magazine is instructed to eliminate the shortcomings and distortions in the editorial work pointed out in this resolution, and to truly turn the magazine into a combat theoretical organ of the Party.

    4. The editorial department of the magazine is advised to take measures to improve contact with the writing activists, expand the scope of the magazine's authors, and guide Party, Soviet, and economic workers, scientific and cultural workers to speak in the magazine.

    5. It should be pointed out that Comrade Shepilov, as the head of the Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee, did not perform his duties competently in supervising the 'Bolshevik' magazine. Comrade Shepilov should be pointed out that he made a gross mistake, causing the Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee to recommend Voznesensky's book as a textbook for the work of Party district committee secretaries and propaganda cadres. These erroneous instructions are to be revoked."

    It should be thought that Comrade Fedoseyev remembers the Central Committee's resolution. Then why did he not mention his own mistakes at all in the articles published in "Izvestia" that aimed to teach everyone? Why didn't he take advantage of such an appropriate opportunity to engage in self-criticism?

    There can be no other explanation for Comrade Fedoseyev's behavior other than concealing his own mistakes, which is impermissible for a communist. The basic responsibility of every party member is not to conceal the mistakes made, not to evade these mistakes, but to honestly and publicly admit their mistakes and correct them. Our Party teaches that only this attitude towards mistakes can guarantee the smooth overcoming of these mistakes and the correct education of cadres.

    Of course, the fact that someone who was originally very confused about the most important issue of socialist political economy and essentially stood on an anti-Marxist position is now publishing correct articles on the issue in the newspaper is already noteworthy. But this is not enough. Fedoseyev should honestly criticize his mistakes. Then the value of his articles would be completely different. If he does not do this, readers have the right to suspect whether his current exposition of the correct Marxist principles is a genuine understanding or a formality, and whether the author is playing tricks.

    关于费道谢也夫的两篇文章
    苏斯洛夫
    编者按：费道谢也夫曾任联共中央机关刊物“布尔什维克”杂志总编辑。他正是如斯大林同志所指出的那种以主观唯心论的观点来看社会发展法则，否认社会主义制度下政治经济学法则的客观性质的人，他并且通过“布尔什维克”杂志大力宣传这种非马克思主义的观点。因此在一九四九年七月被撤职。
    斯大林同志的新著“苏联社会主义经济问题”发表后，费道谢也夫曾在去年十二月十二日和二十一日的“消息报”上发表了两篇文章，来阐述斯大林同志的这一著作。但是他丝毫没有提及和检讨自己过去的错误。因此，苏斯洛夫同志特写此文指出他对待自己所犯严重错误的不正确态度。这对于我国思想工作者也有很重要的教育意义。
    “消息报”上发表了费道谢也夫的两篇文章：“关于社会发展法则的客观性质”和“关于社会发展法则的相互联系”。在这两篇文章中，阐述了斯大林的新的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，详细地说明了关于自然法则和社会法则的客观性质的原理，并重述了斯大林同志在社会主义经济学规律的性质方面那种针对一些主观主义的和其他伪科学的概念的歼灭性的批评。
    根据斯大林同志的指示，作者在今年十二月十二日所发表的文章中，公正地说道，“在某些哲学家和经济学家中间直到最近还是流行着关于社会主义制度下社会发展法则的这么一种不正确的，非马克思主义的概念：就是否定这些法则的客观性质……某些经济学家和哲学家们认为，在工人阶级专政的条件下社会发展的决定力量不是经济，不是基础，而是政策。这种观点实质上就是杜林的唯心主义理论的复活”。在同一文章内，作者作出了这样的结论：“对社会主义发展法则的主观主义的解释，给马克思主义和共产主义建设的实践带来了严重的损害”。
    作者的阐述和探讨本身，并不引起异议。但是，一谈到费道谢也夫的文章，却不由得联想到这样一个问题：他本人过去热心地传布着的正是这种对于社会主义经济法则性质的唯心主义和主观主义的看法，为什么他认为可以不谈自己的错误呢？自然，费道谢也夫这种对自己错误的态度不能不引起这两篇文章的读者们的惊奇。
    谁都知道，在斯大林同志的新著作出现以前，一大部分苏联经济学家和哲学家们恰是在关于社会主义经济法则的性质和作用问题上，陷入了极度混乱的情况，这主要是对社会主义经济规律的主观主义和意志中心主义的解释。这些经济学家和哲学家认为苏维埃国家是可以按照自己的意志，用自己的经济计划和自己的各种政策“改造”、“制定”、“创造”和“消灭”社会主义社会的经济法则的。
    斯大林同志揭穿了这种完全违反了马克思主义而转到主观主义的唯心主义立场的观点的全部错误和危害性。
    斯大林同志所作出的社会主义社会经济法则的客观性质的全面论证，是对马克思—列宁主义宝库的卓越贡献，这个论证给社会主义的政治经济学提供了严格的科学基础。斯大林同志一贯地保卫着和发展着辩证唯物主义关于自然法则和社会法则的客观性质的最重要的原理。他异常明确地指出，社会主义的政治经济学法则也是反映不以人们的意志为转移的经济生活过程的规律的客观法则，因而不能够按照国家的意志“创造”它或“废除”它。
    斯大林同志指出，如果否定社会主义制度下经济生活中的客观规律的存在，就会发生怎样的结果，他写道：
    “这就会使我们陷身在混乱和偶然性的王国，使我们处在奴隶似地依赖于这些偶然性的地位，使我们不仅失去了解事情的可能性，而且简直会在这偶然性的混乱中瞎摸。
    “这就会使我们取消政治经济学这门科学，因为不承认客观的规律性，不研究这些规律性，科学是不能存在和发展的。取消了科学，我们就没有可能预见国内经济生活中事变的进程，即没有可能把那怕是最起码的经济领导工作做好。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”，人民出版社版第七十八页）
    在关于社会主义社会经济规律性质的这一问题上，为一部分苏联经济学家和哲学家所宣传的这种意志中心主义的、唯心主义的论述，严重地阻碍了社会主义的政治经济学问题的科学研究和我们社会主义建设实践问题的理论综合，并给党、苏维埃和科学干部的教育事业带来了损害。
    应该指出，在传播这种与马克思主义背道而驰的有关社会主义政治经济学问题的主观主义的观念方面，当时首先就是“经济问题”、“计划经济”和“布尔什维克”等等杂志，扮演了这个不佳的角色。例如，“布尔什维克”杂志，在过去费道谢也夫同志任总编辑的几年中，不仅没有揭穿了社会主义政治经济学领域中的主观主义的观念，而且还把自己的篇幅供作宣传这些不正确的观点之用。
    杂志把沃兹涅先斯基的“卫国战争期内的苏联战时经济”这本反马克思主义的书，吹得天花乱坠并说成是最近的科学成就，把它当作“对苏联经济科学的珍贵贡献”，把它当作“好像能够帮助我们苏维埃、党和科学干部更完整地和更深刻地认识社会主义社会发展规律”的一本科学参考书（见一九四八年“布尔什维克”第一期，第七十一页、八十八页）。事实上，沃兹涅先斯基的这本书，使社会主义政治经济学问题的研究趋于混乱，这本书是从意志中心主义的观点来看苏维埃社会的计划和国家的作用的混合物，同时把价值法则偶像化了——认为价值法则好像是苏联国民经济各部门之间劳动分配的调节者。
    在费道谢也夫主编“布尔什维克”杂志的时候，编辑部一些工作人员如此地信仰过沃兹涅先斯基的这本反马克思主义的书中的“马克思主义”，他们在杂志上竟然大量引用它，甚至还使用这种反党的手法：把沃兹涅先斯基这本书中的原文加在那些不想把这本书当作知识泉源的作者所写的文章中去。
    “布尔什维克”杂志在库尔斯基、索罗金、盖托夫斯基、科纳科夫及其他的人们的文章中，系统地把社会主义的计划似乎就是苏维埃社会的经济法则这一种看法，宣传成为无可争辩的和不言而喻的原理。可是这意味着什么呢？实质上，这意味着宣传社会主义政治经济学领域内的那种虚伪的、主观主义的观点。如果经济计划是苏维埃社会的经济法则，是社会主义国家所创造的，那么就会有这样一个结论：即我们的国家是苏维埃社会经济法则的创造者。
    在费道谢也夫作总编辑的时候，“布尔什维克”杂志上所发表的一些文章的作者们，根据这种对社会主义经济的规律的非马克思主义的观点，宣布共产党和社会主义国家的政策是社会主义政治经济学的主要对象。例如，科纳科夫在一九四八年第十一期的“布尔什维克”杂志所发表的文章中，断言说，“研究在走向共产主义道路上的布尔什维克党和社会主义国家的政策在苏联经济发展中的决定性的和领导的作用，应当是科学地探讨社会主义国民经济的法则的基础”（见六十八页）。
    因此，费道谢也夫同志在党的面前犯了不少的错误，他通过“布尔什维克”杂志促使那些关于社会主义政治经济学问题的与马克思主义格格不入的观点流行起来，使党、苏维埃和科学干部的教育事业遭受了损害。这就是为什么费道谢也夫的这两篇没有一句话是提到自己错误的文章，不能不引起惊奇的理由。
    难道费道谢也夫同志忘记了这些错误了吗？
    鉴于费道谢也夫同志这种惊人的健忘，回忆一下一九四九年七月十三日联共中央委员会“关于‘布尔什维克’杂志”的决议是适当的。我们把这个决议的全文引用在这里：
    “要承认，‘布尔什维克’杂志办得不能令人满意，而且该杂志现在的编辑委员会对于任务也执行得不好。
    “‘布尔什维克’杂志脱离了社会主义建设的实践。‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑部没有提出，也没有研究马克思—列宁主义理论中的一些迫切问题，特别是与由社会主义过渡到共产主义有关的问题。该杂志只限于说明最普通的、世人通晓的原理，避免对新事实作深刻的分析和总结。编辑部没有总结党争取恢复和进一步发展国民经济的斗争经验。
    “编辑部对国际生活问题，特别是对国际工人运动的问题，阐述得不好。全世界增长着的社会主义和民主的力量在该杂志上表现得软弱无力，人民民主国家在奠定过渡到社会主义的基础中的重大成就也没有反映出来。
    “‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑部脱离党的生活，没有研究和总结各地方党组织的工作，没有提出党内生活和建党中的问题。
    “‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑委员会，在工作中不与党组织联系，而依靠着一小群在杂志上占垄断地位的作者。编辑部使用着不允许使用的工作方法：对于杂志收到的文章，不通知原作者就加上完全改变了这些文章内容的新词句。这种事实就是对布尔什维克报刊传统的粗暴的歪曲。
    “‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑部犯了严重的错误，把杂志的篇幅用来阿谀赞扬沃兹涅先斯基的‘卫国战争期内的苏联战时经济’这本书，毫无任何根据地把它当作教科书和‘深刻的科学研究作品’而大吹大擂。‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑人员奉迎谄媚的程度达到了这种地步，他们竟违背着一些作者的心愿，把沃兹涅先斯基这本书中的话引用到作者的文章中去。
    “联共中央委员会兹决定：
    1、鉴于没有保证对‘布尔什维克’杂志应有的领导和不正确的工作方法，撤销费道谢也夫同志的‘布尔什维克’杂志总编辑职务并对他予以警告。
    撤销亚历山大罗夫同志和约夫楚克同志的‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑委员会的委员职务。
    免去盖托夫斯基同志和科舍列夫同志在‘布尔什维克’杂志中的工作。
    2、确定‘布尔什维克’杂志的编辑委员会的委员为阿巴林同志（总编辑）、伊里切夫同志、波斯伯洛夫同志、克鲁施科夫同志、格里哥里扬同志、姆雅斯尼科夫同志、布尔科夫同志（编辑部秘书）。
    3、责成‘布尔什维克’杂志编辑委员会消除本决议中所指出的编辑工作中的缺点和歪曲，而且要真正把该杂志变成党的战斗的理论机关。
    4、建议该杂志编辑部采取措施，以改善联系作家积极分子的工作，扩大该杂志的作者的范围，引导党、苏维埃和经济工作人员、科学和文化工作者在杂志上发言。
    5、要指出，作为联共中央委员会宣传鼓动部部长的谢比洛夫同志在监督‘布尔什维克’杂志这件事情上没有称职胜任。要给谢比洛夫同志指出，他犯了粗暴的错误，竟使联共中央委员会宣传鼓动部推荐沃兹涅先斯基的这本书，作为党的区委会书记和宣传干部工作方面的教科书。要撤消这些错误的指示”。
    应当想到费道谢也夫同志是记得中央的这个决议的。那么为什么他在“消息报”上所发表的旨在教导大家的文章中完全没有提到自己的错误呢？为什么他没有利用这么适当的机会来从事自我批评呢？
    费道谢也夫同志的行为除去掩饰他自己的错误之外再不可能有其他解释，掩饰自己的错误对一个共产党员来说是不能容许的。每个党员的起码责任就在于不掩饰所犯的错误，不逃避这些错误，而诚实地和公开地承认自己的错误并加以改正。我们党教导说，只有这种对待错误的态度，才能保证顺利克服这些错误和正确教育干部。
    当然，这一个本来对社会主义政治经济学最重要的问题非常糊涂，同时实质上站在反马克思主义立场的人，现在把关于这个问题的正确的文章发表在报上，这件事实就已值得大家注意。但这是不够的。费道谢也夫应当诚实地批判自己的错误。那么他的文章的价值就会完全不同了。他不这样做，读者就有权怀疑他现在所阐述的正确的马克思主义的原理是真正的认识了呢，还是形式上的呢，作者是不是在耍滑头呢？（刘竞译自一九五二年十二月二十四日苏联“真理报”）
