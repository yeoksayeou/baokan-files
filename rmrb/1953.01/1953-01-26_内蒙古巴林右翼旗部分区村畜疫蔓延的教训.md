    Lessons from the Spread of Livestock Epidemics in Parts of Balinyouqi Banner, Inner Mongolia

    To the Editor: In Balinyouqi Banner, Zhaowuda League, eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from September 9th of last year, when bovine anthrax occurred, to December 8th, in three months it spread to three "Nootuk" districts, ten "Gacha" (villages), and nineteen groups. A total of 186 cattle, large and small, were infected, and 177 died.

    Originally, Hu Deleng of the Fourth Sumu of the Eastern United Banner of Xilin Gol League slaughtered three sick oxen pulling salt carts. However, the local epidemic prevention officials did not conduct a serious inspection and concluded that it was not an infectious disease. Not only did they not order the burial of the carcasses of the sick cattle, but they even allowed the skinning and consumption of the meat, which led to the spread of the epidemic. After the outbreak of this livestock epidemic, some villagers, for personal gain, concealed or falsely reported cases (e.g., reporting death by illness as death from other causes), which also contributed to the further spread of the epidemic.

    Afterward, the local People's Government led the masses in prevention and control, and the livestock epidemic has been eradicated in some areas. However, the lesson of this spread of livestock epidemics caused by negligence, resulting in losses to the state and the people, is worth remembering by everyone.

### 内蒙古巴林右翼旗部分区村畜疫蔓延的教训

    内蒙古巴林右翼旗部分区村畜疫蔓延的教训
    编辑同志：内蒙古自治区东部昭乌达盟巴林右翼旗从去年九月九日发生牛气疽病，到十二月八日，三个月共蔓延了三个努图克区、十个嘎查（村）和十九个组。染病的大小牛只共一百八十六头，死亡的有一百七十七头。
    原来是锡林郭勒盟东部联合旗第四苏木胡得冷杀了三条拉盐车的病牛。但是当地防疫机关的干部，没有认真检查，就认为不是传染病，他们不但没有让把病牛的尸体掩埋起来，反而允许剥皮吃肉，以致这种疫病就蔓延起来。在这种畜疫蔓延以后，有的老乡为了个人利益，隐瞒不报或是假报（如牛病死报顶死），结果也促使这一畜疫更加扩大。
    事后当地人民政府领导群众进行了防治，部分地区畜疫已经扑灭。但是这种因为麻痹大意而造成畜疫蔓延致使国家人民遭受损失的教训，是值得大家记取的。    　王倡法
