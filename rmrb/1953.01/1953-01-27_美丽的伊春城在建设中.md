    The Beautiful City of Yichun Under Construction
    Zhang Liguang
    Yichun, located in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, is a newly built forestry city of the motherland. Today, it is being built even more beautifully. The Yichun County People's Government was officially established on December 1st of last year, with jurisdiction over four districts including Yichun, Cuiluan, and Nancha, with a population of 160,000.
    In April of last year, eighteen construction sites in Yichun City started work successively. After more than six months of effort, rows of buildings and staff and worker family dormitories have been built. The Yichun County Government building, staff and worker restaurant, department store, grain company, and native produce company buildings have all been completed, with a total area of 20,056 square meters, exceeding the building area in 1951 by eight times. The total area of staff and worker family dormitories is 11,420 square meters, and 700 staff and worker families have already moved into new homes. Four bridges have also been built on the river embankments around the city.
    Due to the population doubling since 1951, Yichun City has seen a flourishing atmosphere. Industry and commerce have seen significant development, with five new state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives. Private shops, including photo studios, clothing stores, food shops, hotels, tinsmiths, stationery stores, pharmacies, barbershops, lettering shops, and sauce shops, have increased by sixty-one.
    Yichun Middle School has also been established, with 192 children of workers and peasants studying here.
    The construction and development of Yichun City has encountered many difficulties. Taking engineering design as an example, there was not a single dedicated designer in the entire city of Yichun. The leadership selected several people from among the thousands of staff and workers who had some understanding of construction and design and formed a visiting group to visit and study in Harbin. This is how new designers were trained, and they completed the design of the entire project.
    In order to solve the problem of a lack of technical guidance cadres at most sites, the leading organs, on the one hand, searched for and trained 75 cadres as the backbone of the construction sites; on the other hand, they relied on and gave full play to the enthusiasm of the workers, overcoming many difficulties in technical operations. In mid-May of 1952, there were not enough bricks and tiles at each construction site, and work was about to be suspended. The leadership then mobilized brick and tile workers to collectively study and create new operating methods, increasing production efficiency by one time and ensuring the supply of bricks and tiles.
    The difficulties were not only limited to a lack of personnel and insufficient supply of materials and equipment; the management difficulties were even more serious. At the beginning of construction, the common phenomenon at each construction site was that no one was responsible. Some projects were reworked, and no one was in charge of finances. Therefore, the responsible cadres of the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League formed a construction site project quality inspection team with relevant business management personnel, determined the responsibilities of each construction site, established a dedicated responsibility system, reversed the chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible, and improved the quality of the project. A financial system was also established, basically achieving dedicated funds for dedicated use.
    The construction of Yichun City is advancing by constantly overcoming difficulties.
    Large-scale engineering construction in Yichun City will begin again in 1953. The national planned investment in 1953 will increase by more than one time compared to the investment in 1952. The projects include a water tower, a forestry specialized school, middle school buildings, an acute infectious disease hospital, a chronic infectious disease hospital, a department store, a grain company, and 15,000 square meters of staff and worker family dormitories.
    In order to meet this large-scale construction task, the Basic Construction Section of the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau began preparations in late November of last year, submitting material and equipment orders to relevant industrial departments across the country. Cement, heating and other six major equipment have been pre-ordered. Some bricks, tiles, sand, and stones were transported to the construction site in late December. Basic engineering design plans have already begun to be formulated, and all construction projects are currently undergoing design and production of construction instructions and annotations. Some have already been formulated to ensure that the quality of all construction projects reaches more than 95%, and to eliminate the waste of raw materials and labor. In addition, the Bureau has also formed a winter training committee, planning to train 300 technical workers and business management cadres in the winter training, in order to build the beautiful city of Yichun even more beautifully.

### 美丽的伊春城在建设中

    美丽的伊春城在建设中
    张立光
    小兴安岭上的伊春是祖国新建的林业城市。今天她被建设得更加美丽了。伊春县人民政府已于去年十二月一日正式成立，所辖范围有伊春、翠峦、南岔等四个区，人口有十六万。
    去年四月间，伊春城的十八个工地先后开工，经过六个多月的工夫，已建立起成排的楼房和职工家属宿舍。伊春县政府、职工饭店、百货公司、粮食公司、土产公司等楼房都建成了，总的面积达两万零五十六平方公尺，超过了一九五一年楼房建筑面积的八倍。职工家属宿舍总面积为一万一千四百二十平方公尺，现在已有七百户职工家属搬进新的住宅。在城四周的河堤上还建筑了四座桥。
    由于人口较一九五一年增加了一倍，伊春城出现了一片繁荣的气象。工商业有了显著的发展，国营商店和消费合作社增加了五家。私人商店和照像馆、服装店、食品铺、旅店、洋铁铺、文具店、药局、理发馆、刻字处、酱园等增加了六十一家。
    伊春中学也成立起来了，有一百九十二名工农子弟在这里学习。
    伊春城的建筑与发展曾遇到很多困难。拿工程设计来说，全伊春城没有一个专门设计人员。领导上从成千的职工当中挑选了几名稍懂得一些施工和设计的人，组成参观团去哈尔滨参观、学习，就这样培养了新的设计人员，做出了全部工程的设计。
    为着解决绝大部分现场没有技术指导干部的问题，领导机关一方面物色和培养了七十五名干部，作为工地的骨干；一方面依靠和发挥工人的积极性，克服了技术操作中的许多困难。一九五二年五月中旬，各工地的砖瓦都不够用，眼看就要停工，领导上就发动砖瓦工人集体研究，创造出新的操作方法，使生产效率提高一倍，保证了砖瓦的供应。
    困难还不仅限于人员缺乏，物资器材供应不足；管理上的困难更加严重。刚开工时，各工地普遍的现象是无人负责，有些工程返了工，财务没有人管。于是党委、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部就和工地有关业务管理人员组成了工地工程质量检查小组，确定了各工地的责任，建立了专责制，扭转了无人负责的混乱现象，改善了工程质量。财务制度也建立起来了，基本上做到了专款专用。
    伊春城的建设，就是在这样不断克服困难中前进着。
    伊春城一九五三年大规模的工程建筑又要开始了。一九五三年国家计划投资较一九五二年的投资增加一倍多。工程项目有水塔、林业专门学校、中学校舍、急性传染病院、慢性传染病院、百货公司、粮食公司和一万五千平方公尺的职工家属宿舍。
    为了迎接这个规模庞大的建筑任务，伊春森林工业管理局基本建设科从去年十一月下旬就开始进行准备工作，向全国有关工业部门提出了物资器材订货。水泥、暖汽等六种主要器材已提前订购了。部分砖瓦、砂子和石头，提前在十二月末运到工地。基本工程设计计划已经开始制订，所有建筑工程都正在进行设计和制作施工说明与注解，有的已经制订出来，保证全部建筑工程质量达到百分之九十五以上，并杜绝原材料以及人工的浪费。此外，管理局还组成了冬训委员会，计划在冬训中培养三百名技术工人和业务管理干部，以便把美丽的伊春城建设得更加美丽。
