　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: The insidious and selfish American aggressors are forcing Puerto Ricans to serve as cannon fodder for the American army. The 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Third Division in Korea is composed entirely of Puerto Ricans, with the exception of a few senior American officers. The U.S. military headquarters has consistently placed this regiment in the most dangerous positions, forcing them to carry out combat missions they are unable to accomplish. According to the International News Service, when the U.S. 1st Marine Division retreated in a wretched state from the Hungnam area on the east coast of Korea in the winter of 1950, the U.S. military headquarters ordered this regiment to serve as the rearguard. In September of last year, the U.S. military headquarters ordered this regiment to send two battalions to fight against the superior Korean and Chinese People's Army, resulting in heavy losses.

　　Puerto Ricans have begun to recognize the vicious intentions of the U.S. military headquarters, and they are unwilling to continue serving as cannon fodder for the American aggressors. In October of last year, the U.S. military headquarters ordered this regiment to launch a desperate counterattack against the Korean and Chinese positions near Cheorwon. As a result, in the three battalions of this regiment, more than one hundred and seventy-five Puerto Rican soldiers "either directly refused to fight or deserted on the battlefield."

　　In order to suppress the resistance of the Puerto Ricans, the U.S. military headquarters imposed severe punishments on them, sentencing ninety-two people, including one officer, to six months to ten years of imprisonment and hard labor. Such unreasonable measures can only arouse greater dissatisfaction among the Puerto Rican soldiers. According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican soldier wrote a letter to a newspaper in San Juan, Puerto Rico, protesting, saying, "If a counterattack is launched from the area where the accused soldiers retreated last October, it would be tantamount to suicide."

　　After "re-training and reorganizing" the 65th Regiment, the U.S. military headquarters dragged it back to the front line, causing it to suffer even greater casualties. According to a report in the "New York Post" on January 14th, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, told the House Armed Services Committee some "good news" about the Korean War. One piece of "good news" was:

　　"The U.S. military is only holding 25 percent of the front line, and 9 percent of that is being defended by Puerto Rican troops. In recent weeks, the casualties of these troops have been greater than those of any other American troops." This deliberate plot by the American aggressors to use Puerto Ricans as sacrifices will inevitably be met with increasingly strong resistance from the Puerto Rican people.

    侵朝美军强迫波多黎各人替死
    【新华社二十八日讯】阴险自私的美国侵略者正在强迫波多黎各人给美国军队充当替死鬼。侵朝美军第三师的第六十五步兵团除了少数高级军官是美国人以外，其余全是波多黎各人。美军司令部一向把这个团放在最危险的位置上，强迫他们执行不能胜任的战斗任务。据国际新闻社报道，在一九五○年冬天美国的陆战第一师狼狈地从朝鲜东海岸兴南地区逃走时，美军司令部就命令这个团担任最后掩护的任务。在去年九月间，美军司令部命令这个团派两营人去和优势的朝中人民军队作战，结果遭受了沉重打击。
    波多黎各人已经开始认识了美军司令部的这种毒辣的用心，他们不愿意继续给美国侵略者做替死鬼。去年十月间，美军司令部又命令这个团向铁原附近朝中方面的阵地进行绝望的反击，结果，在这个团的三个营中，有一百七十五名以上的波多黎各士兵“不是直接拒绝作战就是临阵脱逃”。
    为了镇压波多黎各人的反抗，美军司令部对他们施行了严厉的惩罚，判处了九十二人六个月到十年的徒刑和苦役，其中有一名是军官。这种无理措施显然只能引起波多黎各士兵的更大不满。据美联社透露，一个波多黎各士兵写信给波多黎各圣约翰城的报纸表示抗议说，“如果从被控的士兵去年十月撤退的地方进行反击，那就等于自杀。”
    美军司令部在将第六十五团“重新训练和整编”以后，又将它拉上前线，使它遭受更大的伤亡。据一月十四日的“纽约邮报”报道，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷告诉了众议院军事委员会一些有关朝鲜战争的“好消息”，有一条“好消息”是：
    “美军仅仅据守着百分之二十五的前线，而其中百分之九是由波多黎各军队防守住的。最近几星期以来，这些军队的伤亡较之任何其他美国军队的伤亡为大。”美国侵略者这种蓄意拿波多黎各人当牺牲品的阴谋，必将遭到波多黎各人越来越强烈的反抗。
