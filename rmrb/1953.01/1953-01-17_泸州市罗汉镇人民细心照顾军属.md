    People of Luohan Town, Luzhou City, Carefully Care for Military Dependents

    Editor: Over the past year, military dependents in Luohan Town, Luzhou City, Sichuan Province, have received care from the people's government and the people in both production and daily life. For example, Chen Yingzhen, a military dependent in Zhuanjiao Lane, Section 5 of the town, is 40 years old and has an elderly mother in her sixties. Her family lacks labor and has difficulties in life. The people's government introduced Chen Yingzhen to work in a weaving production team. As a result, her family's difficulties were resolved. Another example is Zuo Yuzhen's family, a military dependent in Baihua Bang, Section 6 of the town. Her family has a large population and faces difficulties in life. The people's government issued her family 180 jin of preferential grain, and the People's Bank also lent her family 100,000 yuan. Zuo Yuzhen invested all the preferential grain and loans into production. Now, Zuo Yuzhen's production is doing very well, and her life difficulties have been resolved. According to the recent statistics of the town's Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Military-Dependents Committee, the people have spontaneously assisted military dependents in solving difficulties in life in 39 cases in the past year. For example, Li Chengzhong, a military dependent at No. 21 Huangjin Dam in the town, is older (70 years old). In June of last year, he fell down due to a "stroke" and has not been able to get out of bed since. Resident Zhang Qigui invited a doctor to treat Elder Li and brewed medicine for him at night, serving him like a family member. The traditional Chinese medicine doctors Yu Chunhua and Xu Buqing, who came to diagnose the illness, did not charge for their services. Resident Han Rongzhen often patiently rubbed Elder Li's joints with "medicinal wine." Now, Elder Li is able to get up. Some military dependents have difficulties in life, and residents Yang Zhongquan and others have spontaneously donated 1 million yuan to help them.

    The military dependents have written letters to their relatives on the front lines, encouraging their husbands and sons to work hard to kill the enemy and defend the motherland. After Elder Li Chengzhong wrote a letter to his son Li Yuzhang on the Korean front lines, Li Yuzhang replied:

    "We must severely strike the American aggressor bandits to respond to the care of the people of the motherland."

    泸州市罗汉镇人民细心照顾军属
    编辑同志：一年来，四川省泸州市罗汉镇的军属们在生产上、生活上都受到了人民政府和人民群众的照顾。如该镇第五段转角巷军属陈应珍，年四十岁，另有六十多岁的老母亲，家中缺乏劳动力，生活有困难，人民政府便介绍陈应珍到一织布生产组工作。结果她家的困难问题解决了。又如该镇第六段白花塝军属左玉珍家，人口较多，生活困难，人民政府便发给她家一百八十斤优待粮，人民银行也贷给她家人民币十万元。左玉珍把这些优待粮和贷款都投入生产。现在，左玉珍的生产搞得很好，生活困难解除了。据该镇拥军优属委员会最近统计，一年来人民群众自动协助军属解决生活困难的有三十九起。如该镇黄金坝二十一号军属李诚中，年岁较大（七十岁），去年六月里因“中风”跌倒，后即不能起床。居民张启贵便请医生替李老大爷诊治，晚上并代熬药，像亲人一样地服侍他。前去替诊病的中医喻春华、徐步青等，也不收诊费。居民韩荣珍经常耐心地用“药酒”替李老大爷揉擦关节。现在，李老大爷已经能起来了。有部分军属生活困难，居民杨仲权等便自动捐助了人民币一百万元帮助他们。
    军属们纷纷写信给在前线的亲人，勉励各自的丈夫、儿子努力杀敌，保卫祖国。李诚中老大爷给在朝鲜前线的儿子李玉章写去信后，李玉章回信说：
    “一定要狠狠打击美国侵略强盗，来回答祖国人民的关怀。”
