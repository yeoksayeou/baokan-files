Various regions actively develop livestock insurance business

    In order to support the restoration and development of agricultural production, local branches of the People's Insurance Company of China have widely carried out livestock insurance business in vast rural areas. The insured livestock include cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and camels. As of the end of November this year, the number of livestock insured throughout the country has reached 10,348,375.
    In many areas, insurance institutions closely rely on the leadership of Party and government organs and integrate insurance work with central tasks, achieving good results. Insurance committees have been established in some rural areas of North China to be responsible for publicity and mobilization, physical examination, evaluation, and underwriting work. In order to widely and deeply develop livestock insurance work, insurance institutions in the Southwest District entrusted underwriting agents in rural areas, and regularly provided them with guidance and inspection, making them powerful assistants.
    After underwriting livestock, insurance companies in various regions not only reduce disaster losses for farmers, but also mobilize the masses to care for livestock, help farmers improve livestock feeding and management, and carry out vaccination. This promotes the health of livestock and reduces livestock mortality. For example, in the Northwest District, the livestock mortality rate for insured livestock in the first half of 1951 was 3.83%, which dropped to 3.49% in the second half of the year.
    At present, livestock insurance work in various regions still needs to be further deepened and publicized in a detailed manner, clarifying the issues that should be paid attention to after insurance, such as disaster prevention, scope of responsibility, etc.

    各地积极开展牲畜保险业务
    中国保险公司各地分、支公司为支援农业生产的恢复和发展，在广大农村中广泛地开展了牲畜保险事业。保险的牲畜有牛、马、驴、骡和骆驼。截至今年十一月底，全国各地投保的牲畜已达一千零三十四万八千三百七十五头。
    许多地区的保险机构密切地依靠党政领导机关，结合中心工作进行保险工作，获得良好的效果。华北若干农村建立了保险委员会，负责宣传动员、验体、评价、承保工作。西南区保险机构为了广泛深入地开展牲畜保险工作，在农村中委托承保代理人，经常对他们进行辅导和检查，使之成为有力的助手。
    各地保险公司承保牲畜后，不仅给农民减少了灾害损失，同时发动群众爱护牲畜，帮助农民改善牲畜的饲养管理，并进行防疫注射。这就促进了牲畜的健康，减少了牲口死亡率。如西北区一九五一年上半年承保牲畜死亡率为百分之三点八三，下半年降至百分之三点四九。
    目前各地保险公司承保牲畜工作，还需要进一步进行深入、细致的宣传，把保险后应注意的问题，如防灾、责任范围等讲清。
