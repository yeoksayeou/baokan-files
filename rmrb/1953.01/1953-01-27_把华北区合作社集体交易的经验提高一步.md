    Improve the Collective Transaction Experience of Cooperatives in North China
    Shi Lingyun
    Since May 1952, cooperatives in North China have adopted an organized collective transaction method when purchasing wheat and cotton on behalf of the state. In some areas, the supply of essential production and living materials to farmers has also adopted organized collective transactions. Facts have proven that organizing farmers to conduct collective transactions can improve the work efficiency of cooperatives, mobilize the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses of farmers, save farmers a lot of labor, and enable farmers to concentrate on production. Moreover, through collective transactions, the collective spirit of farmers has been further strengthened, and mutual aid and cooperative organizations have been consolidated. Its achievements are significant and should be affirmed.
    However, some local leading cadres still lack sufficient understanding of the purpose and importance of organized collective transactions. They do not carry out thorough mobilization and explanation, but instead adopt administrative orders and formalistic methods. Some cooperatives posted notices when collecting cotton, stating that "in order to carry out collective cotton sales, individual and scattered retail sales will not be purchased." Some are nominally collective cotton sales, but in reality, all cotton sellers go in person. Some do not take into account the habits of the masses or meet their demands, stipulating that everything must be traded collectively, causing the masses to feel that buying and selling is not free. Some cooperatives even use wholesale prices to stimulate collective transactions, making the masses think that collective transactions are simply buying cheap things. All of these have had extremely bad consequences. In addition, the collective transaction process does not value mass creativity, actively improve business management methods, simplify procedures, and improve work efficiency, thus failing to further leverage the role of collective transactions, which must also be resolved. Therefore, in order to better carry out collective transactions, the following work must be done well.
    First, do a good job in organizing mobilization and propaganda and education. Collective transaction is a complex and arduous organizational task. In the organizational process, it is necessary to be meticulous and thorough, and to conduct organizational mobilization, persuasion, and education for the farmers, so that the masses are completely voluntary, and strictly prevent coercive orders and formalistic practices. Any practice that does not proceed from reality, forcibly pulls and drags, and engages in collective transactions for the sake of collective transactions is incorrect. The targets of organizing collective transactions are mainly mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the focus should be on organizing combination contracts or pre-purchase contracts. Excluding and ignoring individual sellers is also incorrect. Cooperatives must promptly discover and solve various specific problems in collective transactions, so that collective transactions truly become a good method that saves time, effort, and is beneficial to both the state and the farmers.
    Second, large-volume and major commodities should be the targets of collective transactions. Such as cotton, grain, major cash crops and major means of production. These products are large in quantity and relatively concentrated, making it easy to organize mass collective transactions. Farmers have encountered difficulties in queuing and crowding when selling cotton and wheat in the past. Collective transactions can solve these difficulties for them, so they are most easily accepted by the masses. Conversely, if small and scattered commodities that the masses are accustomed to individual transactions are rigidly stipulated to be conducted collectively, it will not only be opposed by the masses, but also unnecessary.
    Third, the collective transaction of pure purchase or pure supply should be gradually developed into a mutually integrated, reciprocal collective transaction. When purchasing, it is necessary to do a good job in material supply to meet the characteristics of farmers selling for the sake of buying. Farmers sell products in order to purchase means of production and living materials. Especially after a bumper harvest, the purchasing power of farmers has significantly increased. If the material supply cannot keep up, it will inevitably cause confusion. Only reciprocal collective transactions can make farmers feel more convenient, and the operation of cooperatives will be more planned. Some cooperatives have compiled statistics on what the masses need to buy when conducting collective cotton sales and immediately start organizing material supply. These practices are very good.
    Fourth, we must vigorously improve the business management of cooperatives, simplify procedures, and improve work efficiency to consolidate and expand the results of collective transactions. Last year, various places created many advanced experiences in collective cotton sales, which greatly improved the cotton collection work. Some created a "three-fixed" cotton collection method of fixed tasks, fixed time, and fixed villages, and pre-compiled statistics on the amount of cotton sold and goods purchased in each village, and notified each village of a fixed day and time for delivery and collection according to the cotton station's purchasing capacity. Some created "fast accounting" and "fast payment" methods - the former lists the prices of cotton at all levels into a price comparison table according to quantity, and payment can be made according to the comparison table without accounting, the latter is to check the money in advance into one million, five hundred thousand, or one hundred thousand yuan portions, and no longer need to count when paying. Many cooperatives also fixed a tare weight for cotton, reducing the procedure of returning tare. We must pay attention to these creations of the masses and summarize advanced experiences to fully leverage the effect of collective transactions.

### 把华北区合作社集体交易的经验提高一步

    把华北区合作社集体交易的经验提高一步
    史凌云
    自一九五二年五月以来，华北各地合作社代国家收购小麦和棉花，开始采取了有组织的集体交易的方式。有些地区供应农民主要生产资料和生活资料，也采取了有组织的集体交易的方式。事实证明：组织农民进行集体交易，可以提高合作社的工作效率，发挥农民群众的爱国主义的积极性，给农民节省很多劳力，使农民能专心从事生产。并且通过集体交易，进一步加强了农民的集体主义思想，巩固了互助合作组织。它的成绩是很大的，应该加以肯定的。
    但是，有些地方的领导干部对于有组织的集体交易的目的性及其重要意义至今还认识不足，他们不深入地进行动员解释，而是以行政命令和形式主义的作法办事。有的合作社在收棉时贴出通告，说是“为了开展集体售棉，对于个别的，分散的零售概不收购”。有的名义上是集体售棉，实际上是售棉户都去人。有的不照顾群众的习惯，不根据群众的要求，规定任何东西都要集体交易，致使群众感到买卖不自由。有的合作社竟用批发价格来刺激群众集体交易，使群众认为集体交易就是买便宜东西。所有这些都造成了极坏的后果。此外，在集体交易过程中，不重视群众的创造，不积极改善经营管理方法，不简化手续和提高工作效率，因而不能进一步发挥集体交易的作用，这也是必须解决的问题。因此，为了更好地开展集体交易，必须做好以下工作。
    第一，作好组织动员和宣传教育工作。集体交易是一个复杂而又繁重的组织工作，在组织过程中，一定要细致深入，并向农民进行组织动员、说服教育，使群众完全出于自觉自愿，严防强迫命令和形式主义的作法。任何不从实际出发，强拉硬扯，为集体交易而集体交易的作法，都是不对的。组织集体交易的对象，主要是互助组和农业生产合作社，并应以组织结合合同或预购合同为重点。排挤和不管单卖户也是不对的。合作社要及时发现和解决集体交易中的各种具体问题，使集体交易真正成为省时、省事，对国家、对农民都有利的好办法。
    第二，应以大宗的、主要的商品为集体交易的对象。如棉花、粮食、主要经济作物及主要生产资料等。这些产品数量较大，比较集中，因而也便于组织群众集体交易，农民在过去售棉、售麦时，曾遭遇到排队、拥挤的困难，集体交易能替他们解决这些困难，所以最易为群众所接受。反之，群众习惯于个体交易的零星商品，如果硬性规定一律进行集体交易，不但会遭到群众的反对，而且也无此必要。
    第三，要把单纯收购或单纯供应的集体交易逐步发展为互相结合的、有来有往的集体交易。在收购的时候，必须作好物资供应工作，以适应农民为买而卖的特点。农民出售产品，就是为了购买生产资料和生活资料，特别是丰收之后，农民购买力显著提高，如果物资供应不上，必将造成混乱现象。只有一来一往的集体交易，才能使农民更感到方便，合作社的经营也才更有计划。有些合作社在进行集体售棉时，就把群众需要买的东西统计好了，马上着手组织物资供应，这些作法是很好的。
    第四，必须大力改善合作社的经营管理，简化手续，提高工作效率，以巩固和扩大集体交易的成果。去年各地集体售棉，已创造了不少的先进经验，使收棉工作有了很大的改进。有的创造了固定任务、固定时间、固定村庄的“三定”收棉办法，事先统计各村售棉数量和购货数量，按照棉站收购能力，通知各村定日、定时，准送、准收。有的创造了“快速算账”和“快速付款”办法——前者将各级棉花价格按数量列成价目对照表，不用算账就可以按照对照表付款，后者是把钱预先查点为百万元、五十万元或十万元一份，付款时不用再数。还有不少的合作社称棉固定一个皮，减少了回皮的手续。我们必须重视群众的这些创造，总结先进经验，以充分发挥集体交易的效果。
