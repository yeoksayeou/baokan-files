The total output of Soviet industry in 1952 increased by 11% compared to 1951.

According to the national supply plan, the Soviet national economy received much more raw materials, semi-finished products, fuel, electricity and equipment in 1952 than in 1951.

Last year, further improvements continued to be made in the utilization of industrial equipment. Last year, in the iron and steel industry, the utilization of the effective volume of blast furnaces increased by 5% compared to 1951. The steel production per square meter of hearth area increased by 3%. In the enterprises of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the speed of oil drilling increased by 4% compared to 1951. The utilization of refining capacity has been improved, and the extraction of light fractions has been increased. In the mines of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the productivity of Donbass coal mining combines has been increased. In the enterprises of the Ministry of Power Stations, the fuel consumption per kilowatt-hour has been reduced by 2.3%. The utilization of production capacity in the chemical industry for synthetic ammonia and sulfuric acid, and the utilization of production capacity in cement manufacturing have been improved. The equipment in the cotton textile, woolen textile, silk textile and knitting industries has also been used more effectively. However, a significant amount of production potential in some industries, particularly in machine manufacturing and timber industry, remains underutilized.

The consumption of raw materials, semi-finished products, fuel, and electricity per unit of product in 1952 was lower than in 1951. However, some enterprises still have excessive consumption of raw materials and semi-finished products beyond the prescribed standards.

The production cost of industry in 1952, taking into account the reduction in the prices of raw materials, semi-finished products and fuel, as well as the reduction in electricity, heat and freight costs, was reduced by more than 8% in total.

(III) Application of New Technology in the National Economy

The expansion and improvement of socialist production in 1952, as in previous years, was completed on the basis of the application of various achievements of Soviet science and technology.

In 1952, the Soviet machine manufacturing industry invented approximately six hundred major new types of machines and equipment, ensuring further development of the national economy in technology. The machine tool industry organized the production of more than two hundred new types of metal-cutting and woodworking machine tools, casting and rolling machines, including newly designed highly efficient heavy-duty machine tools, automatic and semi-automatic machine tools, and new automatic continuous production devices.

New coal mining combines that mechanize strenuous operations in thin-seam mines have been manufactured, and new oil drilling equipment and devices have also been manufactured.

At the same time, much new equipment was also manufactured for power stations, the metallurgical industry, the chemical industry and other industries, including more economical hydraulic and steam turbines, highly efficient rolling equipment, machines for melting heat-resistant alloys and low-carbon steel, new automatic control and adjustment devices and instruments for production processes.

Many new, efficient, and powerful earthmovers, bulldozers, dredgers, and excavation cranes for mechanizing earthwork and loading and unloading operations in construction have also been manufactured. New machines, equipment and tools for mechanizing grain and industrial crop planting work, and for mechanizing work in animal husbandry departments, have been manufactured, including self-propelled pneumatic cotton pickers used in non-irrigated cotton growing areas, combine harvesters for silage storage, highly productive mowers, and machines for controlling agricultural pests and plant diseases.

The degree of production mechanization in various sectors of the national economy has been greatly increased.

In 1952, in the mines belonging to the Ministry of Coal Industry, the most strenuous operations in coal mining work – coal loading operations in longwall mining faces and coal and rock loading operations in roadway excavation processes – have been further mechanized. Coal cutting, drilling, coal transportation and underground haulage operations in these mines have already been fully mechanized in previous years. Compared with 1951, the degree of mechanization of these most strenuous operations in 1952 increased by 25% in coal loading and 17% in coal and rock loading. The new method of roadway support using metal and reinforced concrete as supports has continued to be adopted. By the end of 1952, remote control methods had been implemented on approximately two thousand coal mining combines and coal cutters, and more than one thousand six hundred automatic continuous transmission devices.

The degree of mechanization of major logging operations in the timber industry has been increased. Compared with 1951, the amount of work completed by machines in the Ministry of Timber Industry of the USSR in 1952 increased by 26% in logging, 20% in timber dragging, and 39% in timber loading. Although the degree of mechanization of logging operations has been increased, the timber industry did not fully implement the prescribed tasks regarding the mechanization of logging operations in 1952.

The mechanization of loading and unloading operations on railways and waterways was expanded last year.

In 1952, various industrial departments further developed highly efficient technical operating processes and production automation.

In the mines of the Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry of the USSR, new methods of efficiently mining iron ore have been successfully adopted. The production processes of iron smelting and steelmaking have been accelerated, thus increasing the productivity of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. Metallurgical furnaces equipped with automatic temperature control devices have continued to be installed.

In the system of the Ministry of Power Stations, all units of existing hydroelectric power stations had adopted automatic operation methods by the end of 1952. The percentage of hydroelectric power stations implementing remote control operations has reached more than 50% of the total generating capacity of hydroelectric power stations. The automation of production operations in thermal power stations has become more common.

In the petroleum industry, the proportion of turbine drilling in the total amount of drilling projects has been increased. High-speed turbine drilling and dual-hole drilling methods have been successfully adopted last year, thus ensuring the improvement of drilling speed and shortening the time for installation work. The method of maintaining formation pressure, especially maintaining formation pressure by pumping water in a certain area, to carry out petroleum production has been further developed. And the method of pumping water, gas and air into the oil layer to carry out secondary oil extraction has continued to be adopted.

The use of various new and improved milled iron (substitutes for steel) and specially shaped rolled steel in the machine manufacturing industry has been expanded. Advanced high-speed metal cutting methods have been further developed. New direct continuous production devices have been adopted in the manufacturing of parts and the assembly of machines, instruments and tools. Heat treatment and heating furnaces with automatic instruments are still being installed, and the number of automatic and semi-automatic machines applied in various technical operations has increased.

The cotton textile, woolen textile, and other departments of light industry have further adopted new high-efficiency equipment, machines, and automatic equipment. Conveyor methods have also been applied in the production of hosiery and knitwear. Factories in the food industry have been equipped with more automatic machines, automatic continuous production devices, and instruments and devices for automatic control and regulation of production processes.

The number of inventions and rationalization proposals put forward by workers in various sectors of the national economy increased in 1952.

Approximately eight hundred thousand inventions, technical improvements and rationalization proposals were adopted in industry, construction and transportation.

(IV) Agriculture

The sown area of crops in 1952 increased by 2,765,000 hectares compared to 1951. The sown area of the most valuable grain crop – wheat – increased by 3,320,000 hectares compared to 1951. The area planted with cotton, sugar beets, sunflower seeds and other industrial crops has also been expanded in 1952. The planting of feed crops, root crops, silage crops and perennial grasses has also been greatly increased.

According to the statistics of the Central State Survey Commission on Grain Harvest Volume under the Council of Ministers of the USSR, both grain and industrial crops had a bumper harvest in 1952. The total grain harvest volume in 1952 was eight billion poods, of which the total wheat harvest volume increased by 23% compared to the figure in 1951. The total harvest volume of cotton, sugar beets, sunflower seeds, flax and other industrial crops, as well as potatoes and vegetables, was higher than in 1951.

The agricultural technical equipment has been further increased in 1952, and agriculture has received 131,000 tractors (in 15 horsepower units), 41,000 grain harvesting combines (including 21,000 self-propelled harvesters), 57,000 trucks, and more than two million tillage implements, sowing machines, harvesting machines and other agricultural machines, as well as machines and equipment used in animal husbandry departments.

Due to the increase in technical equipment, further mechanization of the work in collective farms and state farms has become possible. In 1952, machine tractor stations completed three-quarters of the main field work of the collective farms. Last year, virtually all plowing work and more than 80% of sowing work in collective farms were done by machines. The work of sowing cotton, sugar beets and other industrial crops has been almost completely mechanized. In all areas where grain is planted in collective farms, 70% of the grain is harvested by combine harvesters, and more than two-thirds of sugar beets are harvested by beet harvesting combines and tractor-drawn beet lifters.

Although the amount of agricultural work completed by machine tractor stations for collective farms in 1952 has greatly increased, the planned targets for harvesting potatoes, silage preservation and autumn plowing have not been fully completed.

The use of electricity in collective farms for water supply, feed preparation, milking and sheep shearing has greatly increased.

In 1952, the number of publicly owned livestock in collective farms increased by the following percentages: cattle 6%, pigs 4%, sheep 7%, horses 4%.

In 1952, the number of livestock in the farms of the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR increased by the following percentages: cattle 5%, pigs 4%, sheep 8%, horses 9%.

Collective farms, machine tractor stations and afforestation stations, and state farms in the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union, fulfilled the plan for planting protective forest belts adopted in 1948, and planted protective forest belts with an area of 725,000 hectares in 1952. The annual afforestation plan has been overfulfilled.

Large-scale work was completed in the development of irrigated agriculture and the drainage of swamps and wetlands in 1952.

(V) Development of Railway, Waterway and Highway Transportation

The railway transportation plan for 1952 was overfulfilled. The volume of freight transported increased by 9% compared to 1951. The overall plan for average daily loading volume was completed by 104%. However, some railways did not complete their plans for loading important goods. The goal of shortening the turnaround time of freight cars has been achieved last year. Fuel consumption per ton-kilometer on railway transport decreased by 2.4% compared to 1951.

The volume of freight transported by inland waterways increased by 12% compared to 1951, but there is still some distance from the target stipulated in the annual plan.

The volume of freight transported by sea increased by 9% compared to 1951. The marine freight transport plan for 1952 has been completed.

The volume of freight transported by automobiles increased by 15% compared to 1951.

(VI) Increase in the Amount of Basic Construction

The total amount of state basic construction in 1952 was 111% of the figure in 1951. The total amount of basic construction for power stations was 126% of that in 1951; for ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries 111%, for coal and petroleum industries 105%, for machine manufacturing industry 112%, for building materials industry 109%, for light industry and food industry 109%, and for housing construction 110%.

In 1952, a large amount of newly produced equipment was used in all sectors of the national economy.

The part of the plan for constructing giant hydroelectric power stations and irrigation systems on the Volga River, Don River, Dnieper River and Amu Darya River in 1952 has been successfully completed.

The Lenin Volga-Don Canal was opened to navigation in 1952.

Construction organizations received a large number of high-efficiency machines and equipment in 1952. Compared with 1951, the number of excavators increased by 25%, earthmovers by more than 40%, bulldozers by 29%, tower cranes by more than 70%, and the number of other construction machines and equipment has also greatly increased. In construction projects, there is a transition from individual operation mechanization to full mechanization of the construction process. However, in many construction projects, construction machines and equipment have not been used satisfactorily.

The construction cost in 1952 was reduced compared to 1951. At the same time, many construction organizations failed to guarantee the completion of the tasks stipulated in the national plan regarding improving the organization of construction and installation work, reducing miscellaneous expenses and administrative expenses, thereby reducing construction costs.

In 1952, state enterprises, institutions, local Soviets, and residents of urban and industrial residential areas, with the help of government loans, built houses with a total living area of more than 27 million square meters. In addition, 370,000 houses were built in rural areas.

(VII) Expansion of Trade

The trade in the Soviet Union continued to expand in 1952. Due to the further development of industry and agriculture, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs, the government has implemented the fifth reduction in the retail prices of general consumer goods since the abolition of the rationing system from April 1, 1952.

The prices of books, including textbooks, have also been reduced from April 1, 1952. As a result of this price reduction, the Soviet ruble has become more and more stable, its purchasing power has increased, and the goods sold to the people have further increased. In 1952, state-owned stores and cooperatives sold 10% more goods to the people than in 1951. The sales volume of various major items increased as follows: meat 10%, fish products 13%, butter, vegetable oil and other edible fats 17%, eggs 9%, milk and dairy products 17%, sugar 26%, confectionery 19%, silk fabrics 20%, clothing 11%, knitwear 17%, socks 11%, leather shoes 15%, furniture more than 20%, soap 7%, civil construction materials more than 20%, bicycles 24%, clocks and watches 20%, television sets 27%, cameras 30%, sewing machines 22%, and phonographs 25%. The sales volume of household refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and washing machines has also greatly increased.

The retail trade distribution network of state-owned trade and cooperatives also expanded in 1952. Approximately 7,000 new stores were opened in 1952. The network of specialized stores in towns, industrial residential areas and rural areas has also been greatly expanded.

The sales volume of agricultural products in collective farm markets, especially the sales volume of flour, grain, potatoes, vegetables, poultry, eggs and honey, also continued to increase in 1952.

(VIII) Increase in the Number of Employees and Improvement in Labor Productivity

At the end of 1952, the total number of employees in various sectors of the Soviet national economy was 41.7 million, an increase of 900,000 compared to the end of 1951. The number of employees in industry, agriculture and forestry, construction and transportation increased by 725,000, the number of education institutions, scientific research institutions and medical institutions increased by 115,000, and the number of public canteens, housing management and public utilities increased by 60,000.

In 1952, as in previous years, there were no unemployed people in the Soviet Union.

Last year, 326,000 young people graduated from trade schools, railway schools, mining schools and industrial refresher schools to become skilled workers and have been employed in industry, construction and transportation.

In 1952, 7.8 million employees learned technology or improved their technology through spare-time individual or collective education, or by attending spare-time refresher courses.

In 1952, the labor productivity of industrial workers increased by 7% compared to 1951, of which machine manufacturing increased by 10%, iron and steel industry increased by 8%, non-ferrous metal industry increased by 8%, coal mining industry increased by 4%, petroleum industry increased by 5%, and chemical industry increased by 8%.

In 1952, the labor productivity of construction workers increased by 7% compared to 1951.

(IX) Cultural Development, Improvement of Public Health and Municipal Construction

In 1952, the cultural level of the Soviet people was further improved.

In terms of the development of seven-year and secondary education, the number of students in grades five to ten increased by more than 1.5 million in 1952, of which the number of students in grades eight to ten increased by 1 million.

Due to the implementation of the task of transitioning from universal seven-year education to universal secondary education in the capitals of the various republics, cities directly under the jurisdiction of the Union Republics, and large industrial centers in the states and border regions, the number of students in grades eight to ten in these cities increased by 44% in 1952.

In 1952, the number of students in higher education institutions totaled 1,442,000 (including correspondence students), an increase of 85,000 compared to 1951. Technical schools and other secondary specialized schools (including correspondence courses) had a total of 1,475,000 students, an increase of 100,600 compared to 1951.

In 1952, the number of graduates from higher education institutions and technical schools serving the national economy with expert qualifications increased by 8% compared to 1951.

The number of people who work on the one hand and study in higher, secondary specialized schools and general schools on the other hand has increased.

For example, the number of students in correspondence schools and higher evening schools increased by 8% compared to 1951; correspondence technical schools and technical evening schools 11%; labor youth and rural youth schools 8%.

In 1952, more than 27,000 graduate students studied in higher education institutions or scientific institutions to conduct scientific work.

1,776 scientists, engineers, agronomists, writers, artists, workers and advanced farmers have won the Stalin Prize for their outstanding achievements in science, invention, literature and art.

In 1952, various libraries belonging to the state and public organizations totaled 368,000, with a total collection of more than 830 million volumes.

The number of film equipment in 1952 increased by 5% compared to the previous year.

In the summer of 1952, 5.5 million children and teenagers vacationed in Young Pioneer camps, children's sanatoriums or travel camps, travel boarding houses, or spent the whole summer in the countryside with their kindergartens, children's homes or nurseries.

Medical and preventive care for residents was further improved in 1952. Hospitals, maternity hospitals, pharmacies and other medical institutions, as well as sanatoriums and rest homes, have increased in 1952. The number of hospital and maternity hospital beds increased by more than 50,000 compared to 1951, and the number of doctors increased by 14,000 compared to 1951.

In 1952, the output of the pharmaceutical industry increased by 23% compared to 1951. The production of highly effective medical and preventive medicines, diagnostic and treatment devices and medical equipment has greatly increased.

In 1952, much work was done to construct urban enterprises, improve urban and industrial areas, lay water pipes and sewers, expand tram and trolleybus services, install gas and urban heating supply equipment, pave streets and squares in cities with stones and asphalt, plant grass and trees in cities and industrial areas, and open boulevards, public gardens and parks.

(X) Increase in National Income and Personal Income

The national income of the Soviet Union in 1952 increased by 11% compared to 1951.

In the Soviet Union, the entire national income belongs to the working people. As in the previous year, the working people of the Soviet Union received approximately three-quarters of the national income to meet their individual material and cultural needs, and the remaining one-quarter was at the disposal of the state, collective farms and cooperative organizations to expand socialist production and meet other needs of the entire country and society.

Due to the increase in national income, the living standards of workers, farmers and intellectuals can be greatly improved, and socialist production can be further expanded.

The improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people is manifested in the increase in the nominal wages and real wages of employees, and in the increase in the income of farmers from the enterprises of collectively operated collective farms and from their homestead gardens and personal sideline occupations.

In 1952, as in previous years, the people received various benefits from the state, namely: receiving various allowances and subsidies from the social insurance fund for employees; receiving pensions from the social support fund; free or low-cost entry into sanatoriums and rest homes and sending children to children's educational institutions; subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers; free medical care; free education and vocational and professional training; scholarships and many other rewards and benefits. Not only that, but all employees, approximately 42 million employees, received at least two weeks of paid leave, and workers in some industries had even longer holidays. In 1952, the total value of these rewards and benefits enjoyed by the people from state subsidies reached 129 billion rubles.

Due to the price reduction of general consumer goods, the increase in monetary wages, the increase in the cash and in-kind income of farmers, and the increase in the rewards and benefits received by the people from state subsidies, the income of each employee increased by 7% in 1952 compared to 1951, and that of each farmer engaged in agricultural labor increased by 8%.

    去年在利用工业设备方面继续获得进一步的改进。去年在钢铁工业中，鼓风炉有效容积的利用较一九五一年增加百分之五。每平方公尺炉底面积的产钢量增加百分之三。在石油工业部的各企业采油钻井的速度较一九五一年增加百分之四。炼油厂生产能力的利用已经改进，轻馏分提取量已经增加。在煤业部各矿坑中，顿巴斯采煤联合机的生产率已经提高。在电站部的各企业中，每瓩时所需的燃料耗费减少了百分之二点三。化学工业部人造阿摩尼亚和硫酸的生产能力的利用，水泥制造业生产能力的利用，都有了改进。棉织业、毛织业、丝织业和针织业的设备也得到了更有效的利用。然而若干工业，特别是机器制造业和木材工业，依旧有大量的生产潜力没有充分利用。
    一九五二年每一单位产品所需的原料、半制成品、燃料和电力的耗费量，已较一九五一年低。然而还有若干企业有超过规定的标准耗费过多原料和半制成品的现象。
    一九五二年工业方面的生产成本，如将原料、半制成品和燃料价格的减低及电力、热力和货运费用的减低计算在内，共减低了百分之八以上。
    （三）新技术在国民经济方面的应用
    一九五二年社会主义生产的扩大与改进，正如前些年一样，是在应用苏联科学和技术的各种成就的基础上完成的。
    在一九五二年内，苏联机器制造业发明了约六百种主要的新式的机器和设备，确保了国民经济技术方面获得进一步的发展。母机工业组织了二百多种新式金属切削与木工母机、铸造与压延机器的生产，其中包括新设计的具有高度效率的重载母机、自动与半自动的母机和新式的自动机器连续生产装置。
    使薄煤层矿场上的费力操作机械化的新式采煤联合机已经制造出来，新式的采油器械和设备也已制造出来。
    同时也为电力站、冶金工业、化学工业和其他工业制造了许多新式设备，其中包括更经济的水力与蒸汽透平、具有高度效率的辗压设备、熔炼耐热合金和低碳钢的机器、新式自动控制和调节生产过程的装置和器械。
    同时还制造了许多新式的、效率强大的铲土机、开路机、挖泥机以及使建筑中的土工和装卸操作机械化的掘凿起重机。使谷物和工业作物种植工作机械化以及使畜牧部门的工作机械化的新式机器、设备和工具已经制造出来，其中包括在不用灌溉的植棉区内使用的自动推进气力摘棉机、饲料保藏室掘造联合机、具有高度生产率的割草机以及扑灭农业害虫和植物病害的机器。
    国民经济各部门生产机械化的程度大大提高了。
    一九五二年在煤业部所属的各矿中，采煤工作中最费力的操作——长壁采掘面中的装煤操作以及巷道掘进过程中的装煤和装石的操作——已更进一步机械化，这些矿场的截煤、凿煤、运煤以及地下拖运的操作，在前几年就已经完全机械化了。与一九五一年相较，一九五二年这些最费力的操作的机械化程度在装煤方面提高了百分之二十五、在装煤与装石方面提高了百分之十七。继续采用了金属与钢筋混凝土作支柱的新式巷道支撑法。到一九五二年年底，约两千台采煤联合机和截煤机以及一千六百多部自动连续传送装置，已实行了远距离操纵法。
    木材工业中主要伐木操作的机械化程度已经提高。与一九五一年相较，苏联木材工业部一九五二年用机器完成的工作量，在伐木方面增加了百分之二十六，在拖曳木材方面增加了百分之二十，在装运木材方面增加了百分之三十九。伐木操作的机械化程度虽然提高了，然而木材工业在一九五二年并未完全贯彻关于伐木操作机械化的规定任务。
    铁路和水上运输的装货与卸货操作的机械化，去年已经扩大。
    一九五二年各工业部门更进一步发展了高效率技术操作过程和生产自动化。
    苏联钢铁工业部的各矿中，成功地采用了高效率的开采铁矿砂的新方法。熔铁和炼钢的生产操作过程已经加速，鼓风炉和马丁炉的生产力因而提高。继续安装了备有自动调节热度装置的冶金炉。
    在电站部的系统中，到一九五二年年底，现有各水电站的一切单位都已采用自动操作法。水电站中实行远距离操纵作业法的已达水电站总发电能力的百分之五十以上。火力发电站生产操作的自动化已更加普遍了。
    在石油工业中，透平钻井在钻井工程总量中所占比重已经提高。去年已成功地采用了高速透平钻井法和双孔钻井法，这样就确保了钻井速度的提高并且缩短了安装工作的时间。保持地层压力、特别是在一定区域内抽水来保持地层压力，以进行石油生产的方法，已进一步发展了。并继续采用了把水、煤气和空气抽进油层以进行二道采油的方法。
    各种新式改良铣铁（钢的代用品）和特殊形状的压延金属在机器制造业方面的使用扩大了。先进的高速金属切削法得到了进一步的发展。在制造零件和装配机器、器械和工具方面采用了新式的直接连续生产装置。带有自动仪器的热处理和加热炉仍在继续装置中，各种技术操作中所应用的自动与半自动机器的数目增加了。
    棉织业、毛织业以及轻工业的其他部门进一步采用了新式的高效率的装置、机器和自动设备，袜类和针织品的生产方面也应用了传送方法。食品工业各工厂装备了更多的自动机器、自动连续生产装置以及自动控制和调节生产过程的器械和装置。
    一九五二年国民经济各部门工人所提出的发明和合理化建议的数目增加了。
    工业、建筑和运输方面约采用了八十万件发明、技术改良和合理化的建议。
    （四）农业
    一九五二年农作物播种面积较一九五一年增加二百七十六万五千公顷。最宝贵的谷类作物——小麦——的播种面积，较一九五一年增加了三百三十二万公顷。一九五二年种植棉花、甜菜、葵花子和其他工业作物的面积也已扩大。饲料作物、根菜作物、保藏饲料作物和多年生的草类的播种也大量增加。
    根据苏联部长会议所属谷物收获量中央国家调查委员会的统计数字，一九五二年谷物和工业作物都得到了丰收。一九五二年谷物总收获量是八十亿普特，其中小麦的总收获量较一九五一年的数字增加了百分之二十三。棉花、甜菜、葵花子、亚麻和其他工业作物以及马铃薯和蔬菜的总收获量都较一九五一年为高。
    一九五二年农业技术设备已有进一步增加，农业方面得到了十三万一千部拖拉机（十五匹马力的单位），四万一千部谷物收割联合机（包括二万一千部自动推进收割机），五万七千部卡车和二百多万部耕具、播种机、收割机和其他农业机器以及牲畜部门所用的机器与设备。
    由于技术设备的增加，集体农庄和国营农场的工作进一步机械化便有了可能。一九五二年机器拖拉机站完成了集体农庄主要田间工作的四分之三。去年实际上集体农庄的一切耕田工作和百分之八十以上的播种工作都是由机器来做的。播种棉花、甜菜和其他工业作物的工作差不多已完全机械化。在集体农庄种植谷物的全部地区，百分之七十的谷物是由收割联合机收割的，三分之二以上的甜菜是由甜菜收割联合机和拖拉机曳引甜菜起重机收割的。
    一九五二年机器拖拉机站为集体农庄完成的农业工作的数量虽然大大增加了，但没有全部完成关于收割马铃薯、保藏饲料和秋耕的工作计划。
    集体农庄在给水、配制饲料、挤牛乳和剪羊毛方面使用的电力已大量增加。
    一九五二年集体农庄公有牲畜的头数增加百分比如下：牛百分之六，猪百分之四，羊百分之七，马百分之四。
    一九五二年苏联国营农场部农场的牲畜头数增加百分比如下：牛百分之五，猪百分之四，羊百分之八，马百分之九。
    苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地区的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和造林站以及国营农场，履行一九四八年通过的关于种植防护林带的计划，一九五二年共种植了七十二万五千公顷面积的防护林带。全年造林计划已经超额完成。
    一九五二年在发展灌溉农业和沼泽及沼地的排水方面完成了大规模的工作。
    （五）铁路、水路和公路运输的发展
    一九五二年的铁路运输计划超额完成了。运货量比一九五一年提高了百分之九。每日平均装载量的总计划完成了百分之一百零四。但是，有些铁路没有完成它们的装载重要货物的计划。缩短货车往返时间的目标去年已经达到。铁路运输每公里吨燃料消费比一九五一年减少了百分之二点四。
    内河运货量比一九五一年增加了百分之十二，但与全年计划规定的目标还有一些距离。
    海上运货量比一九五一年增加了百分之九。一九五二年的海道货运计划已经完成。
    汽车运货量比一九五一年增加了百分之十五。
    （六）基本建设数量的增加
    一九五二年的国家基本建设总额为一九五一年数字的百分之一百一十一。动力站的基本建设总额为一九五一年的百分之一百二十六；黑色金属和有色金属工业百分之一百一十一，采煤和石油工业百分之一百零五，机器制造业百分之一百一十二，建筑材料业百分之一百零九，轻工业和食品工业百分之一百零九，住宅建筑百分之一百一十。
    在一九五二年，所有国民经济部门使用了大量的新生产设备。
    一九五二年计划中关于在伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河和阿姆河上修建巨型水电站和灌溉系统的部分已经胜利完成。
    列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河已在一九五二年通航。
    各建筑机构在一九五二年得到了大量高效率的机器和设备。和一九五一年相比，挖掘机的数目增加了百分之二十五，铲土机百分之四十以上，开路机百分之二十九，塔形起重机百分之七十以上，其他建筑机器和设备的数目也大大增加了。在建设工程中，正由个别操作机械化过渡到建筑过程的全部机械化。但是，在许多建设工程中，建筑机器和设备尚未得到令人满意的利用。
    一九五二年的建筑成本比一九五一年减低了。同时，有许多建筑机构未能保证完成国家计划中规定的关于改进建筑和装置工作的组织，削减杂支和行政费从而减低建筑成本的任务。
    在一九五二年，国家企业、机关、地方苏维埃以及城市和工业居住区的居民在政府贷款的帮助下建筑了居住面积共计二千七百多万平方公尺的房屋。此外，农村地区修建了三十七万栋房屋。
    （七）贸易的扩大
    一九五二年苏联的贸易继续扩大。由于工业和农业的进一步发展、劳动生产率的提高以及生产成本的减低，政府从一九五二年四月一日起，又实行了自从配给制取消以来的第五次减低一般消费品的零售价格。
    包括教科书在内的书籍价格从一九五二年四月一日起也同样减低了。这一次再度减低物价的结果，苏联卢布越发稳固了，它的购买力提高了，销售给人民的货物更进一步增加了。一九五二年国营商店和合作社销售给人民的货物比一九五一年多百分之十。各种主要物品销售量增加的情况如下：肉类百分之十，鱼品百分之十三，牛油、植物油和其他食用脂肪百分之十七，蛋类百分之九，牛奶和乳制品百分之十七，糖百分之二十六，糖果百分之十九，丝织品百分之二十，服装百分之十一，针织品百分之十七，袜类百分之十一，皮鞋百分之十五，家具百分之二十以上，肥皂百分之七，民用建筑材料百分之二十以上，脚踏车百分之二十四，钟表百分之二十，电视机百分之二十七，照相机百分之三十，缝纫机百分之二十二，留声机百分之二十五。民用冰箱、真空吸尘器和洗衣机的销售量也大大增加。
    一九五二年国营贸易和合作社的零售贸易分布网也扩大了。一九五二年约有七千家新商店开张。各城镇、工业住宅区和农村中的专门商店网也大大扩充了。
    集体农庄市场上农产品的销售量，特别是面粉、谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、家禽、蛋类和蜂蜜的销售量在一九五二年也继续增加了。
    （八）职工人数的增加和劳动生产率的提高
    一九五二年年底，苏联国民经济各部门中职工总人数是四千一百七十万，比一九五一年年底增加了九十万人。工业、农林业、营造业和运输业方面职工人数增加了七十二万五千人，教育机关、科学研究机关及医务机关增加了十一万五千人，在公共食堂、房屋管理和公用事业方面增加了六万人。
    一九五二年和往年一样，苏联没有失业者。
    去年有三十二万六千个青年从贸易学校、铁道学校、采矿学校和工业进修学校毕业成为熟练工人，并已在工业、营造业和运输业方面就业。
    一九五二年有七百八十万职工凭借业余的个别的或集体的教育，或进业余进修班学习，学会了技术或提高了他们的技术。
    一九五二年产业工人的劳动生产率比一九五一年提高了百分之七，其中机器制造业提高了百分之十，钢铁工业百分之八，有色金属工业百分之八，采煤工业百分之四，石油工业百分之五，化学工业百分之八。
    一九五二年建筑工人的劳动生产率比一九五一年提高了百分之七。
    （九）文化的发展、公共卫生和市政建设的改进
    在一九五二年，苏联人民的文化水平进一步提高了。
    在七年制和中等教育的发展方面，五年级到十年级的学生人数在一九五二年增加了一百五十多万人，其中，八年级到十年级的学生人数增加了一百万人。
    由于在各共和国首都、加盟共和国直辖市以及州和边疆区的大工业中心实行由普及七年制教育过渡到普及中等教育的任务，这些城市中八年级到十年级的学生人数在一九五二年增加了百分之四十四。
    在一九五二年，高等学校的学生人数共有一百四十四万二千人（包括函授班学生），比一九五一年增加了八万五千人。技术学校和其他中等专科学校
    （包括函授班）共有学生一百四十七万五千人，比一九五一年增加了十万零六千人。
    一九五二年高等学校和技术学校的毕业生以专家资格为国民经济服务的人数比一九五一年增加了百分之八。
    一方面工作，一方面在高等、中等专科学校和普通学校学习的人数增加了。
    例如，函授学校和高等夜校的学生人数比一九五一年增加了百分之八；函授技术学校和技术夜校百分之十一；劳动青年和农村青年学校百分之八。
    在一九五二年，二万七千多研究生在高等学校或科学机构中深造，以便进行科学工作。
    一千七百七十六名科学家、工程师、农学家、作家、艺术家、工人和先进农民，因为在科学、发明、文学和艺术方面有卓越的成就，已荣获斯大林奖金。
    一九五二年，属于国家和公共团体的各种图书馆共有三十六万八千个，藏书总数超过八亿三千万册。
    一九五二年的电影设备数目比前一年增加了百分之五。
    一九五二年夏天，有五百五十万儿童和少年在少年先锋营、儿童疗养院或旅行营、旅行寄宿舍中度假，或者是与他们的幼儿园、儿童之家或托儿所一起，在乡下度过了整个的夏天。
    为居民服务的医药和预防事业在一九五二年都有了进一步的改进。医院、产妇院、药房和其他医疗机关以及疗养院、休养所在一九五二年都增加了。医院和产妇院病床的数目比一九五一年增加了五万多个，医生人数比一九五一年增加了一万四千人。
    在一九五二年中，医药工业的生产量比一九五一年增加了百分之二十三。非常有效的医疗及预防药剂、诊断和治疗装置和医疗用具的生产大大地增加了。
    在一九五二年中，做了许多工作以建设城市企业，改进城市和工业区，敷设自来水管和下水道，扩充有轨电车和无轨电车业务，装置煤气和城市热力供应设备，在城市的街道和广场上铺上石子和柏油，在城市和工业区种植草木，开辟林荫大道、公共花园和公园。
    （十）国民总收入和个人收入的增加
    一九五二年苏联的国民收入比一九五一年增加了百分之十一。
    在苏联，整个国民收入是属于劳动人民的。和前一年一样，苏联的劳动人民得到国民收入中的约四分之三来满足自己的个人物质生活和文化生活的需要，而其余的四分之一就归国家、集体农庄和合作社组织去支配，以便扩大社会主义生产并满足整个国家和社会的其他需要。
    由于国民收入的增加，工人、农民和知识分子的生活水平就能够大大改善，社会主义的生产也得以进一步扩大。
    苏联人民生活水平的提高，表现在职工名义工资和实际工资的增加上，表现在农民从共同经营的集体农庄的企业以及从他们的宅旁园圃和个人副业方面所得收入的增加上。
    一九五二年和往年一样，人民更由国家得到各种利益，这就是：从职工社会保险基金项下领取各种津贴和补助费；从社会赡养基金中领取养老金；免费或低费进疗养院和休养所及送儿童进儿童教养机关；发给儿女众多的母亲和单身母亲的津贴；免费获得医疗；免费受教育以及职业和专业的训练；奖学金以及其他许多报酬和利益。不但这样，所有一切职工，就是约四千二百万职工，都得到至少两个星期工资照付的假期，有若干行业的工人假期更长。一九五二年人民从国家的补助费中享受到的这些报酬和利益总值达一千二百九十亿卢布。
    由于一般消费品的减价、由于货币工资的增加、由于农民现款和实物收入的增加、以及由于人民从国家补助费中获得的报酬和利益的增加，每一个职工的收入，一九五二年比一九五一年增加了百分之七，每一个从事农业劳动的农民则增加了百分之八。
