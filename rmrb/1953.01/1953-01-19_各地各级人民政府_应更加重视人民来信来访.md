    [News from Our Newspaper] Since the State Council of the Central People's Government announced the "Decision on Handling Letters from the People and Receiving People's Visits," people's governments at all levels in various regions have generally attached greater importance to handling letters from the people and receiving the masses than before. People's governments at the provincial level and in most regions above the county (city) level have established inquiry offices or reception rooms in accordance with the State Council's regulations, and have established various systems, assigning specific personnel to be responsible for handling letters from the people and receiving the masses. As a result, letters and visits from the people have been increasing daily. Especially since the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and after the serious handling of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," the masses' awareness and enthusiasm have increased, and the number of letters and visits from the people has increased significantly, thereby further expanding the scope of contact between the Party, the people's government, and the masses. The Inquiry Office of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government received an average of 352 letters and visits from the masses per month after the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" was handled, an increase of more than 75 percent compared to before. The General Office of the Hubei Provincial People's Government received only a few dozen letters from the people throughout 1950, but by 1952, it was receiving more than 120 letters each month. After the establishment of the Inquiry Office of the former Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office, the number of visitors reached a maximum of more than 60 people per day. The issues raised in the letters and visits from the people are very broad, including reports, criticisms, suggestions, reflections on the implementation of the Party and the people's government's policies, as well as various aspects of the people's lives and demands. The vast majority of letters are written with real names and addresses, and generally more than 90 percent of the materials reflected are authentic and well-intentioned, with infinitely rich and extremely valuable content. Therefore, the leading organs and cadres of the Party organizations and people's governments in most regions attach great importance to handling letters from the people and receiving the masses. Comrade Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, personally checked the incoming letters every day in the early stage of the "Three-Anti" movement, approved important letters, and thanked the letter writers through the Liberation Daily. Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau, also frequently inquired about the handling of letters from the people and personally solved important issues raised by the masses. The leading organs of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and various people's organizations in Shanghai conducted a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the work of handling letters from the people by various organs and organizations at the municipal and district levels in September and October of last year. The Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has also stipulated that cadres at the bureau and division chief level will receive the masses every Saturday afternoon. In addition to personally reading the most important letters from the people, Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen and Deputy Mayor designated the Secretariat to classify and statistically analyze the letters from the people according to their content, and make a written report every week along with representative letters. Xi'an Mayor Fang Zhongru personally instructed the Municipal Government Secretariat to provide opinions on handling letters from the people and inspected the implementation. The city received 32,973 letters of accusation and denunciation from the people during the "Three-Anti" movement, and each case was handled. The Linfen Special District Commissioner's Office in Shanxi Province stipulates that the first day of each month is the day for the Commissioner to receive the masses; Linfen, Yishi and other counties stipulate that the county magistrate will personally receive the masses on the first and fifteenth day of each month. Hukuan County spends three days each month specifically studying the situation of letters and visits from the masses.
    The materials reflected in the letters and visits from the people have helped the Party and government leading organs in many regions solve many important problems and have vigorously promoted the central work and mass movements in various periods, such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the judicial reform movement. For example, Cixi, Yin County, Yuyao, Dinghai, and Xiangshan counties in Ningbo Special District, Zhejiang Province, suffered severe natural disasters in 1951, and agricultural crops generally suffered poor harvests; however, the Ningbo Special Office and the CPC Ningbo Prefectural Committee only relied on the typical production increase reports from below to make a conclusion that production had generally increased by 10% and reported it upwards. The agricultural tax was also not reduced or exempted as required. By February and March of 1952, serious spring famine had occurred in 309 townships in these five counties, and the affected farmers even sold their land, cattle, and green crops to survive, but the leaders in various places did not pay attention. At this time, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee learned of this serious situation from a letter from Tang Ding, a citizen of Shanghai, and immediately sent responsible cadres to the disaster areas to investigate and immediately took various measures to rescue the situation, finally stopping the development of the famine in April. The Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau received more than 16,300 letters from the people reporting tax evasion from October 1951 to August 1952. As a result of inspections based on the reports from the masses, the taxes that should be supplemented and fined by only twelve households, such as Baowei Pharmacy, reached 8.6 billion yuan. The major cases of Wang Kangnian, a profiteer from the Dakang Pharmacy, bribing officials, selling fake medicines, and deceiving the Volunteer Army, were all reported by letters from the masses. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in Chongqing, several "theft groups" of illegal bourgeois elements were uncovered based on the materials reflected in the letters from the masses; the exposure of the "Star Four Dinner Party" large-scale theft group also greatly benefited from the reports of the masses. In addition, there are many examples of people's governments uncovering certain counter-revolutionary organizations, cleaning up bad cadres, and purifying the revolutionary ranks based on letters from the masses reporting counter-revolutionary elements and exposing cadres' violations of laws and disciplines. In the letters from the people, a considerable part belongs to the request to solve specific problems of individuals or a few people. The people's government generally handles these matters responsibly, thereby further enhancing the prestige of the Party and the people's government among the masses. For example, residents of Lotus Pond in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, wrote to the people's government requesting the construction of sewers in Lotus Pond to drain sewage. After investigation, the people's government believed that it was indeed necessary and immediately started construction. The masses said: Only the people's government cares about the lives of the working people and helps us eliminate this scourge that has been causing trouble for decades. At the same time, universal problems can be discovered from individual and specific events. For example, when the "Three-Anti" movement was carried out in the county-level organs in Linyu County, Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, a letter was received from Zhang Jianguo of Wenzhuang Village in the county, reflecting that the pears produced in the village could not be sold. The leaders of the county grasped this matter to find the root cause, checked out the bias of only caring about the "Three-Anti" and neglecting the leadership of production, and quickly corrected this shortcoming.
    However, on a national scale, there are still many shortcomings in the work of handling letters and receiving the masses in many regions and organs, mainly manifested in the following aspects: (1) Necessary systems have not been established, or have been established but not well implemented. For example, when the Party and government leading organs in Shanghai inspected the work of handling letters from the people by various organs at the municipal and district levels in September and October of last year, they found that the number of letters from the people accumulated by thirteen municipal-level organs and nineteen districts, according to incomplete statistics, reached 22,134. Among them, some units filed the letters from the people without even opening the envelopes, and some letters even had stamps attached, and they were filed together with the stamps. The leading organs in Beijing recently inspected the opinion boxes set up by some public security police stations and found that many letters of accusation in the boxes had been blurred by wind and rain and could not be identified. (2) Shifting responsibility to each other, copying and forwarding letters from the people layer by layer, without taking responsibility, so that they become ineffective when processed. For example, Zheng Yimei, a poor woman in Fuzhou City, wrote a letter in April of last year requesting the government to provide free medical treatment because she had a tumor. This letter was circulated many times through the Fuzhou Branch of the China People's Relief General Association, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Health Bureau, involving sixteen people and taking twenty-eight procedures, delaying it for thirty-one days. When the approval was given to introduce Zheng Yimei to the hospital for treatment, Zheng Yimei had been dead for nineteen days. (3) Handling things hastily, not investigating or studying the issues raised in the letters from the people, and not reviewing the processing results reported by the lower levels, and answering irresponsibly; or perfunctorily dealing with them. For example, some units in Shanghai City only wrote formulas in response to letters from the people: "Under research and improvement," "Under processing." The Xuchang Municipal People's Government in Henan Province did not conduct an investigation on the letter from the Central South Military and Political Committee transferred by the Provincial Government to investigate "Guo Yajie's dissatisfaction with his punishment, requesting a re-examination," and simply copied the basis for the original punishment of Guo by the Municipal Public Security Bureau by the Personnel Section and forwarded it to the Provincial Government. When the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture handled a letter from the masses asking "Where to buy the famous local product small root cabbage seeds in Shandong Province," the non-staple food section of the department irresponsibly replied: "Ask a Shandong friend you know to buy it on your behalf... You can also buy it by writing to the Shandong Seed Company." But there is no such company in Shandong. For example, although the Zhejiang Provincial People's Court has a reminder system, it only fills in the reminder forms one by one for all the letters transferred to the lower levels for handling in a formal manner and sends them out in a large bundle, and as a result, very few are reported by the lower levels. (4) Treating the visiting masses, not receiving them patiently and warmly, but showing annoying and impatient emotions, and dislike the masses for speaking long-windedly. Or mechanically implementing the rest system, and refusing to meet people regardless of whether the masses have urgent issues during rest or vacation time, making the masses who came from afar travel back and forth in vain.
    The reason for the occurrence of the above shortcomings is mainly that the cadres of these organs, including some leading cadres, do not attach enough importance in their thinking to the political significance of handling letters from the people and receiving the masses, regarding handling letters from the masses as an "extra burden," thinking that letters from the masses are deliberately "causing trouble," and that the issues raised are "trivial matters." For example, the leading cadres of Sanlin District, Shanghai County, Jiangsu Province, once said: "Letters from the masses are trivial matters, and it doesn't matter whether they are handled or not." Some local cadres emphasize that the central work is busy and put letters from the masses on the shelf. For example, the cadres in some districts of Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, often say: "The tasks assigned by the Party Committee must be completed, and it doesn't matter if the letters from the masses are put aside for a while." Individual responsible cadres in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, even believe that the masses are far from the city, and the establishment of a system for handling letters from the people and receiving the masses will not have much effect; some cadres in the county even believe in an extremely wrong way that letters from the masses that do not go through the local government are "black letters," and the problems reflected will not be correct. The above serious phenomena are now being corrected. For example, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee conducted a general inspection of the people's opinion boxes in the city and stipulated specific methods for handling letters from the people in the future. People's governments at all levels in various regions must quickly correct the shortcomings in the work of handling letters from the people and receiving the masses.

### 各地各级人民政府  应更加重视人民来信来访

    各地各级人民政府
    应更加重视人民来信来访
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院公布“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”以后，一年半以来，各地各级人民政府较以前普遍重视了处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作。各省及多数地区县（市）以上的人民政府都根据政务院的规定，设立了问事处或接待室，并建立了各项制度，指定专人负责处理人民来信和接见人民群众。因此，人民来信和来访的日益增多。特别是在“三反”“五反”运动以来和“张顺有事件”严肃处理以后，群众的觉悟性和积极性都提高了，人民来信和来访的件数更有显著增加，因而更扩大了党、人民政府和群众联系的范围。山西省人民政府问事处，在“张顺有事件”处理以后，每月群众来信来访平均有三百五十二件，较以前增加百分之七十五强。湖北省人民政府办公厅在一九五○年全年收到的人民来信不过几十件，到一九五二年，每个月就收到一百二十件以上。前川西人民行政公署成立问事处以后，人民来访者最多时，每日达六十多人。人民来信和来访所提出的问题非常广泛，包括检举、批评、建议、反映党和人民政府政策执行情况，以及人民群众生活与要求等各方面。来信绝大多数都写了真实的姓名、住址，所反映的材料一般有百分之九十以上是真实的，出于善意的，内容是无限丰富而又极其宝贵的。因此多数地区的党组织和人民政府的领导机关和干部非常重视处理人民来信和接见人民的工作。中共中央华东局书记饶漱石同志在“三反”运动初期，每天亲自检查来信情况，批办重要信件，并曾通过解放日报向来信人致谢。华东局第三书记谭震林同志也经常查问人民来信处理情况，并亲自解决群众提出的重要问题。中共上海市委、上海市人民政府及上海市各人民团体的领导机关，在去年九、十两月曾全面深入地检查市、区级各机关、团体处理人民来信的工作。上海市工商局并已规定每星期六下午由局、处长一级的干部接见群众。北京市市长彭真和副市长除亲自批阅最重要的人民来信外，并指定秘书厅把人民来信按内容分类统计，连同具有代表性的来信，每周作出书面报告。西安市市长方仲如亲自批示市府秘书厅对人民来信的处理意见，并检查执行情况。该市在“三反”运动中收到的人民检举控告信三万二千九百七十三件，件件都作了处理。山西临汾专区专员公署规定每月一日为专员接见人民群众日；临汾、猗氏等县规定每月一日和十五日由县长亲自接见人民群众。壶关县每月以三天时间专门研究群众来信、来访的情况。
    人民群众的来信和来访所反映的材料，帮助了许多地区的党政领导机关解决了不少重要问题，并有力地推动了各个时期的中心工作和群众运动，如镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”、司法改革等运动的开展。例如浙江省宁波专区的慈溪、鄞县、余姚、定海、象山等五个县在一九五一年遭受严重天灾，农作物普遍歉收；而当时宁波专署、中共宁波地委却只凭下面典型增产报告，就作出普遍增产一成的结论上报。征收农业税时也未按规定实行减免。到一九五二年二、三月间，这五个县有三百零九个乡发生严重春荒，受灾农民甚至以出卖土地、耕牛及青苗度日，而各地领导上并未注意。这时中共浙江省委根据上海市民唐鼎的来信，了解到这一严重情况，即派负责干部到灾区调查，并立即用各种方法进行抢救，终于在四月份停止了灾荒的发展。上海市人民政府税务局自一九五一年十月至一九五二年八月收到的人民检举偷税、漏税的来信一万六千三百多件，根据群众的检举进行检查的结果，仅宝威药房等十二户应该补罚的税款就达八十六亿元。该市大康西药房奸商王康年行贿、卖假药、欺骗志愿军等重大案件，都是经群众来信检举出来的。重庆市在“三反”“五反”运动中，根据群众来信反映的材料，破获了几个不法资产阶级分子的“盗窃集团”；“星四聚餐会”大盗窃集团的破获，人民群众的检举也起了很大作用。此外，各地人民政府根据群众检举反革命分子、揭发干部违法乱纪行为的来信，因而破获某些反革命组织，清洗坏干部，纯洁革命队伍的事例，也屡见不鲜。在人民群众的来信中，有相当大的一部分属于要求解决个人或少数人的具体问题的。人民政府一般也作了认真负责的处理，因而更加提高了党和人民政府在群众中的威信。如江苏常州市荷花池居民给人民政府写信，要求在荷花池修建下水道，以排泄污水。人民政府经过调查后，认为确属必要，立即兴工。群众说：只有人民政府才关心劳动人民的生活，帮助我们除掉这条作恶几十年的祸根。同时，从个别具体事件中，又可发现具有普遍性的大问题。如河北唐山专区临榆县在县级机关进行“三反”运动时，接到该县温庄张建国来信，反映该村庄所产的梨卖不出去。县的领导上抓住这件事找根源，检查出领导上只顾“三反”，忽略了领导生产的偏向，就很快地纠正了这一缺点。
    但是，在全国范围内，仍有不少地区和机关在处理人民来信和接见人民群众工作中，存在着许多缺点，主要表现在以下几方面：（一）没有建立必要的制度，或建立了而没有很好地执行。例如，上海市党政领导机关在去年九、十两月检查市、区两级各机关处理人民来信工作时，发现十三个市级机关和十九个区积压的人民来信件数，据不完全的统计即达二万二千一百三十四件。其中有几个单位接到人民来信后，连信封都没有拆就归了档，有的来信中还附了邮票，就连信带邮票一起归了档。北京市领导机关最近检查部分公安派出所设置的意见箱，发现箱中很多检举信被风吹雨淋，已经字迹模糊，不能辨认。（二）互相推诿，把人民来信层层照抄照转，不负责任，以致到处理时已失时效。如福州市贫苦妇女郑依妹因生毒瘤病，在去年四月间写信要求政府免费医疗。这封信经中国人民救济总会福州市分会、市民政局和卫生局等单位多次周转，经过十六个人，费了二十八道手续，拖延了三十一天。当批准介绍郑依妹住医院治疗时，郑依妹已死了十九天。（三）草率处理，对人民来信所提出的问题不调查不研究，对下级回报的处理结果也不加审查，即不负责任地答复；或者搪塞应付。例如，上海市有些单位在答复人民来信时，只公式化地写上
    “正研究改进中”、“正在处理中”。河南许昌市人民政府把中南军政委员会经省府转来查办的“郭亚杰不满对其处分，请求重作处理”的信件，不作调查，即原封不动地由人事科把原市公安局对郭处分的依据材料，照抄一份转省府。山西省农业厅在处理群众询问“山东省有名的土产小根白菜籽到哪里买”的来信时，该厅副业科不负责地答复：“托认识的山东朋友代买……写信给山东种籽公司亦可买到。”而山东并无此公司。又如浙江省人民法院虽有催办制度，但只是形式地把全部转交下级办理的来信，一件件填上催办单，一大捆发出去，结果下级报上来的也寥寥无几。（四）对待来访的群众，不是耐心地热诚接待，而表现讨厌和急躁的情绪，嫌群众说话啰嗦。或者机械地执行休息制度，在休息或休假时间，不管群众有无紧急问题，一律拒绝接见，使远道来访的群众徒劳往返。
    发生以上这些缺点的原因，主要是这些机关的干部，包括一部分领导干部，对处理人民来信和接见人民工作的政治意义，在思想上没有足够的重视，把处理群众来信看作是“额外负担”，认为群众来信是故意“找麻烦”，所提的问题是“小事情”。如江苏上海县三林区的领导干部曾说：“群众来信是鸡毛蒜皮，处理不处理无所谓。”有些地方的干部强调中心工作忙，把群众来信束置高阁。如江苏省丹阳县有些区的干部常说：“党委交下来的任务一定要完成，群众来信搁一下不要紧。”松江省桦川县的个别负责干部竟认为群众离城远，建立处理人民来信和接见人民群众工作制度，起不了多大作用；该县部分干部甚至极端错误地认为，群众来信不经当地政府是“黑信”，反映问题不会正确。以上这些严重现象，现在正在被纠正着。例如北京市委对全市人民意见箱做了普遍的检查，并规定了今后处理人民来信的具体办法。各地各级人民政府都必须迅速纠正处理人民来信和接见人民工作中的缺点。
