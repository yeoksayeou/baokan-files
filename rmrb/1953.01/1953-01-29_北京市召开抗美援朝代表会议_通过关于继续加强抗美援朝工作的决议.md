Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: The Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association convened a conference of representatives for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea on the afternoon of the 27th.

Present at the meeting were Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, Vice-Chairmen Zeng Zhaolun and Shu Sheyu, Standing Committee members Chen Yuan, Hu Xikui, and Li Zongen, Secretary-General of the branch Li Leguang, heads of various departments, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than 500 people. Li Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, was also invited to attend the meeting.

At the meeting, Zhang Xiruo first gave a report to the representatives on the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea in Beijing over the past two years and future tasks. He said: The people of all circles in Beijing have been active and hardworking in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the work has been very successful. In the patriotic production increase and economy movement of 1952 alone, the workers of Beijing increased production and saved over 1.1 trillion yuan of wealth for the country. Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have also made considerable achievements in carrying out the patriotic bumper harvest movement and in farming on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. People from all walks of life enthusiastically carried out donation campaigns, donating a total of 93 fighter planes. At the same time, the people of Beijing also launched mass consolation activities. In addition to sending representatives to participate in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to console the Chinese People's Volunteer Army twice, the broad masses also regularly wrote letters of consolation to the most beloved people. The Anti-American Aid Korea Branch alone sent more than 210,000 letters to the front. Despite these achievements, we cannot be complacent and must continue to step up the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. To this end, we should actively respond to the four calls of the General Association and do the following tasks well:

(1) In conjunction with the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers movement, the Spring Festival cultural activities, and the report of the Chinese delegation to the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, conduct another universal and in-depth ideological education of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea among people from all walks of life. Use various forms (such as radio, slides, blackboards, lectures, forums, etc.) to publicize the great victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the increasingly strong situation of our side to the masses; expose the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the armistice negotiations and deliberately expand the war of aggression; point out the importance of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea for our national defense construction, economic construction, and for defending world peace, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle; continue to raise the political awareness of people from all walks of life and their understanding of the current international and domestic situation, and be highly vigilant against the U.S. imperialists' attempts to expand the conspiracy of the war of aggression; widely publicize and promote the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers movement, and earnestly assist the families of martyrs and soldiers in solving their difficulties. This publicity work requires us to make significant achievements from now until the Spring Festival. (2) Launch a movement to learn from the Volunteer Army. The noble moral character of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in loving the motherland and the people, their great spirit of internationalism, and their revolutionary heroism in overcoming difficulties and fighting bravely have become a model and example for the people of the whole country to emulate. We should call on people from all walks of life to learn from them diligently in their respective posts, actively produce, work hard and study, and accelerate our economic and cultural construction. (3) Promote "Patriotic Day" for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. In order to make the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea regular and become the driving force for national economic and cultural construction, the system of "Patriotic Day" for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea should be promoted among rural and urban street residents. Xiaoshaguo Hutong in Xidan District and Xiehejian Village in the Jingxi Mining Area have achieved good experience in this regard and should be promoted. In rural areas, it is best to choose a day each month as "Patriotic Day" after mass discussion. Among street residents, it is best to stipulate one day every two weeks as "Patriotic Day." On this day, everyone will check or revise the patriotic covenants and conduct propaganda and education work on Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. In rural areas, the main content of Patriotic Day should be to check on patriotic bumper harvests, preferential treatment for families of soldiers, sanitation, and literacy. Among street residents, the main content should be to check on the patriotic health movement, preferential treatment for and respect for families of martyrs and soldiers, and participation in street work. In state-owned factories, the experience of the small group patriotic covenant system of the Northeast 53 Factory should be promoted. In private factories and shops, the patriotic covenant system based on factories and shops as units should continue to be promoted, and regular inspections and revisions should be carried out. (4) Improve the work of writing letters of consolation and advocate making friends with the Volunteer Army. In the past, people from all walks of life in Beijing wrote more than 210,000 letters of consolation to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is a great achievement. However, there are shortcomings in our communication work. Some letters of consolation are empty, generalized, clich√©, and formulaic, lacking concrete and vivid content. In the future, we should advocate writing about the vivid facts of various constructions in our city, district, and unit, as well as the production, work, and study of individuals. The writing should be easy to understand, good at expressing emotions, and the length should not be too long. We hope that advanced model production and learning units, labor model comrades from workers and farmers, and writers and actors will often write letters of consolation to the front, telling them about the achievements of the motherland in various aspects and the new harvests and new situations in factories, schools, and rural mutual aid groups, and encouraging them to fight more bravely and resourcefully, and to study more enthusiastically. In this regard, the connection between the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School and the Yang Landi Hero Company is a good example. We hope everyone will learn from their experience.

After Mo Yichang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, reported on the plan for future propaganda work on Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, representatives from the Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union introduced the preferential treatment work of the Mentougou Mechanical and Electrical Factory; Zhang Wenying, a resident of Xidan District, introduced the experience of establishing "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Day" in Xiaoshaguo Hutong; Wang Youdao, a representative of the Farmers Association of Xiehejian Village in the Jingxi Mining Area, introduced the experience of "Patriotic Day" in the village; and Zhou Shiqin, a student of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School, introduced how the school learned from the Volunteer Army by communicating and making friends with them. Tao Dayong, a representative of various democratic parties in Beijing, Huang Runping, an industrial labor model, Yin Weichen, an agricultural labor model, Yan Jingyao, a representative of the education sector, Fu Huating, a representative of the business sector, Wang Lihua, a representative of the women's sector, Cao Baolu, a representative of the literary and art sector, Yang Wanfang, a preferential treatment model, Shan Yichang, a representative of ethnic minorities, and Wang Zizhong, a representative of the religious sector, spoke in succession, unanimously expressing their willingness to continue to mobilize the masses to deepen the movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. Huang Runping, an industrial labor model, said: All the staff and workers of our North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory actively carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy in the movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, completed the state's production tasks for 1952 two months and two days ahead of schedule, and completed the plan to increase production and practice economy by 12% ahead of schedule by eight days. In the future, we must work harder to produce more and support the front. Yin Weichen, an agricultural labor model, said that their village had established an agricultural production cooperative, and the yield per unit area had increased four times compared with before liberation. The poor and hired peasants who used to lack food and clothing now have surplus grain. These happy days are inseparable from the Volunteer Army fighting the American aggressors on the front line. They strive to increase production by another 15% in 1953 to support the most beloved people. Wang Lihua, a representative of women, said that women deeply know who is protecting their peaceful and happy life. The housewives in their Chongwen District are determined to consolidate the current 51 reading groups, strengthen current affairs propaganda, do a good job in the patriotic health movement, strengthen the work of preferential treatment, and solve the difficulties in the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers, so that the soldiers at the front can fight more peacefully to defend peace.

During the meeting, the Chinese People's Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea General Association entrusted the Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association to present three banners to the New China Pingju Opera Troupe, the Beijing Quyi Troupe, and the Capital Quyi Troupe, who participated in the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea.

Finally, all the representatives of the Beijing Conference of Representatives for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea unanimously passed the resolution on continuing to strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, based on the report of Chairman Zhang Xiruo.
