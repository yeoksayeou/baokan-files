Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: The Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association convened a conference of representatives for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea on the afternoon of the 27th.

Present at the meeting were Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, Vice-Chairmen Zeng Zhaolun and Shu Sheyu, Standing Committee members Chen Yuan, Hu Xikui, and Li Zongen, Secretary-General of the branch Li Leguang, heads of various departments, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than 500 people. Li Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, was also invited to attend the meeting.

At the meeting, Zhang Xiruo first gave a report to the representatives on the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea in Beijing over the past two years and future tasks. He said: The people of all circles in Beijing have been active and hardworking in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the work has been very successful. In the patriotic production increase and economy movement of 1952 alone, the workers of Beijing increased production and saved over 1.1 trillion yuan of wealth for the country. Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have also made considerable achievements in carrying out the patriotic bumper harvest movement and in farming on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. People from all walks of life enthusiastically carried out donation campaigns, donating a total of 93 fighter planes. At the same time, the people of Beijing also launched mass consolation activities. In addition to sending representatives to participate in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to console the Chinese People's Volunteer Army twice, the broad masses also regularly wrote letters of consolation to the most beloved people. The Anti-American Aid Korea Branch alone sent more than 210,000 letters to the front. Despite these achievements, we cannot be complacent and must continue to step up the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. To this end, we should actively respond to the four calls of the General Association and do the following tasks well:

(1) In conjunction with the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers movement, the Spring Festival cultural activities, and the report of the Chinese delegation to the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, conduct another universal and in-depth ideological education of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea among people from all walks of life. Use various forms (such as radio, slides, blackboards, lectures, forums, etc.) to publicize the great victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the increasingly strong situation of our side to the masses; expose the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the armistice negotiations and deliberately expand the war of aggression; point out the importance of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea for our national defense construction, economic construction, and for defending world peace, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle; continue to raise the political awareness of people from all walks of life and their understanding of the current international and domestic situation, and be highly vigilant against the U.S. imperialists' attempts to expand the conspiracy of the war of aggression; widely publicize and promote the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers movement, and earnestly assist the families of martyrs and soldiers in solving their difficulties. This publicity work requires us to make significant achievements from now until the Spring Festival. (2) Launch a movement to learn from the Volunteer Army. The noble moral character of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in loving the motherland and the people, their great spirit of internationalism, and their revolutionary heroism in overcoming difficulties and fighting bravely have become a model and example for the people of the whole country to emulate. We should call on people from all walks of life to learn from them diligently in their respective posts, actively produce, work hard and study, and accelerate our economic and cultural construction. (3) Promote "Patriotic Day" for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. In order to make the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea regular and become the driving force for national economic and cultural construction, the system of "Patriotic Day" for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea should be promoted among rural and urban street residents. Xiaoshaguo Hutong in Xidan District and Xiehejian Village in the Jingxi Mining Area have achieved good experience in this regard and should be promoted. In rural areas, it is best to choose a day each month as "Patriotic Day" after mass discussion. Among street residents, it is best to stipulate one day every two weeks as "Patriotic Day." On this day, everyone will check or revise the patriotic covenants and conduct propaganda and education work on Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. In rural areas, the main content of Patriotic Day should be to check on patriotic bumper harvests, preferential treatment for families of soldiers, sanitation, and literacy. Among street residents, the main content should be to check on the patriotic health movement, preferential treatment for and respect for families of martyrs and soldiers, and participation in street work. In state-owned factories, the experience of the small group patriotic covenant system of the Northeast 53 Factory should be promoted. In private factories and shops, the patriotic covenant system based on factories and shops as units should continue to be promoted, and regular inspections and revisions should be carried out. (4) Improve the work of writing letters of consolation and advocate making friends with the Volunteer Army. In the past, people from all walks of life in Beijing wrote more than 210,000 letters of consolation to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is a great achievement. However, there are shortcomings in our communication work. Some letters of consolation are empty, generalized, cliché, and formulaic, lacking concrete and vivid content. In the future, we should advocate writing about the vivid facts of various constructions in our city, district, and unit, as well as the production, work, and study of individuals. The writing should be easy to understand, good at expressing emotions, and the length should not be too long. We hope that advanced model production and learning units, labor model comrades from workers and farmers, and writers and actors will often write letters of consolation to the front, telling them about the achievements of the motherland in various aspects and the new harvests and new situations in factories, schools, and rural mutual aid groups, and encouraging them to fight more bravely and resourcefully, and to study more enthusiastically. In this regard, the connection between the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School and the Yang Landi Hero Company is a good example. We hope everyone will learn from their experience.

After Mo Yichang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, reported on the plan for future propaganda work on Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, representatives from the Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union introduced the preferential treatment work of the Mentougou Mechanical and Electrical Factory; Zhang Wenying, a resident of Xidan District, introduced the experience of establishing "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Day" in Xiaoshaguo Hutong; Wang Youdao, a representative of the Farmers Association of Xiehejian Village in the Jingxi Mining Area, introduced the experience of "Patriotic Day" in the village; and Zhou Shiqin, a student of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School, introduced how the school learned from the Volunteer Army by communicating and making friends with them. Tao Dayong, a representative of various democratic parties in Beijing, Huang Runping, an industrial labor model, Yin Weichen, an agricultural labor model, Yan Jingyao, a representative of the education sector, Fu Huating, a representative of the business sector, Wang Lihua, a representative of the women's sector, Cao Baolu, a representative of the literary and art sector, Yang Wanfang, a preferential treatment model, Shan Yichang, a representative of ethnic minorities, and Wang Zizhong, a representative of the religious sector, spoke in succession, unanimously expressing their willingness to continue to mobilize the masses to deepen the movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. Huang Runping, an industrial labor model, said: All the staff and workers of our North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory actively carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy in the movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, completed the state's production tasks for 1952 two months and two days ahead of schedule, and completed the plan to increase production and practice economy by 12% ahead of schedule by eight days. In the future, we must work harder to produce more and support the front. Yin Weichen, an agricultural labor model, said that their village had established an agricultural production cooperative, and the yield per unit area had increased four times compared with before liberation. The poor and hired peasants who used to lack food and clothing now have surplus grain. These happy days are inseparable from the Volunteer Army fighting the American aggressors on the front line. They strive to increase production by another 15% in 1953 to support the most beloved people. Wang Lihua, a representative of women, said that women deeply know who is protecting their peaceful and happy life. The housewives in their Chongwen District are determined to consolidate the current 51 reading groups, strengthen current affairs propaganda, do a good job in the patriotic health movement, strengthen the work of preferential treatment, and solve the difficulties in the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers, so that the soldiers at the front can fight more peacefully to defend peace.

During the meeting, the Chinese People's Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea General Association entrusted the Beijing branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association to present three banners to the New China Pingju Opera Troupe, the Beijing Quyi Troupe, and the Capital Quyi Troupe, who participated in the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea.

Finally, all the representatives of the Beijing Conference of Representatives for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea unanimously passed the resolution on continuing to strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, based on the report of Chairman Zhang Xiruo.

    北京市召开抗美援朝代表会议
    通过关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的决议
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京市抗美援朝分会在二十七日下午召开抗美援朝代表会议。
    到会的有北京市抗美援朝分会主席张奚若，副主席曾昭抡、舒舍予，常务委员陈垣、胡锡奎、李宗恩，分会秘书长李乐光，各部部长以及各界代表共五百多人。中国人民志愿军政治部秘书长李贞也应邀出席会议。
    会上，张奚若首先向代表们作了关于北京市两年来抗美援朝工作和今后任务的报告。他说：北京市各界人民在抗美援朝运动中是积极努力的，工作是很有成绩的。北京市的工人们只在一九五二年一年的爱国增产节约运动中，就为国家增产节约了一万一千多亿元的财富。北京郊区农民们在开展爱国丰产运动中，在对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的代耕工作上，也都取得了不少成绩。各界人民热烈地开展捐献运动，一共捐献了战斗机九十三架。同时，北京各界人民还展开了群众性的慰问活动，除两次推派代表参加中国人民赴朝慰问团慰问中国人民志愿军外，广大群众还经常给最可爱的人写慰问信，只经抗美援朝分会送往前方的就有二十一万多封。虽然有这些成绩，但我们不能自满，还必须继续加紧抗美援朝工作。为此，我们应该积极响应总会四项号召，并要做好以下几项工作：
    （一）结合春节拥军优属运动，春节文艺活动，和出席维也纳世界人民和平大会中国代表团的传达报告，在各界人民中再进行一次普遍的、深入的抗美援朝的思想教育。利用各种形式（如广播、幻灯、黑板报、讲演会、座谈会等）向群众宣传中朝人民军队的伟大胜利及我方愈战愈强的形势；揭露美帝国主义者破坏停战谈判，蓄意扩大侵略战争的阴谋；指明抗美援朝对于我们国防建设、经济建设和对于保卫世界和平的重要意义，以激发群众的斗争热情；继续提高各界人民的政治觉悟和对当前国际国内形势的认识，高度警惕美帝国主义企图扩大侵略战争的阴谋；广泛宣传与推进春节拥军优属运动，认真协助烈属、军属解决困难。这一宣传工作，要求我们从现在起，到春节前做出显著的成绩。（二）开展学习志愿军的运动。中国人民志愿军爱祖国、爱人民的高尚道德品质，伟大的国际主义精神，克服困难、英勇奋战的革命英雄主义精神，已成为全国人民效法的榜样和表率。我们应号召各界人民在自己的岗位上努力向他们学习，积极生产，努力工作和学习，加速我们的经济、文化建设事业。（三）推行抗美援朝“爱国日”。为使抗美援朝工作经常化，成为国家经济建设、文化建设的动力，应在农村及城区街道居民中间推行抗美援朝爱国日制度。西单区小沙果胡同和京西矿区的斜河涧村在这方面已取得良好的经验，应该推广。在农村最好经过群众讨论每月选择一天为“爱国日”，在街道居民中最好每两周规定一日为“爱国日”。在这一天，大家来检查或修订爱国公约，进行抗美援朝的宣传教育工作。爱国日在农村应以检查爱国丰产、检查优抚代耕、卫生、识字为主要内容。在街道居民中，应以检查爱国卫生运动、优抚与尊重烈军属以及参加街道工作为主要内容。在公营工厂应推行东北五三工厂的小组爱国公约制度的经验。在私营工厂商店应继续推行以厂、店为单位的爱国公约制度，并进行经常的检查修订。（四）改进写慰问信的工作，提倡和志愿军交朋友。过去北京市各界人民给中国人民志愿军写过二十一万多封慰问信，这是很大的成绩。但我们的通信工作是有缺点的，有些慰问信内容空洞，流于一般化、口号化、公式化、缺乏具体生动的内容。今后应提倡写本市、本区、本单位各种建设的生动事实及个人的生产、工作和学习情况。文字要通俗易懂，善于表达感情，篇幅不宜太长。我们希望各先进模范的生产、学习单位，工人、农民中的劳动模范同志和作家演员们，经常向前方写慰问信，告诉他们关于祖国各方面的成就和工厂、学校、农村互助组中的新收获、新情况，勉励他们更加勇敢机智地战斗，更加热情地学习。在这方面，北京师范大学附属女子中学和杨连第英雄连的联系是个好例子。希望大家吸取她们的经验。
    会议在北京市抗美援朝分会宣传部副部长莫艺昌报告了今后抗美援朝宣传工作的计划之后，由京西煤矿工会代表介绍门头沟机电厂的优抚工作；西单区居民张文英介绍小沙果胡同建立“抗美援朝日”的经验；京西矿区斜河涧村农民协会代表王有道介绍该村“爱国日”的经验，北京师范大学附属女子中学学生周士琴介绍该校如何通过和志愿军通信和交朋友、向志愿军学习的经验。北京市各民主党派代表陶大镛、工业劳动模范黄润萍、农业劳动模范殷维臣、教育界代表严景耀、工商界代表傅华亭、妇女界代表王立华、文艺界代表曹宝禄、优抚模范杨万芳、少数民族代表闪懿昌、宗教界代表王梓仲等相继讲话，一致表示要继续动员群众深入抗美援朝运动。工业劳动模范黄润萍说：我们华北农业机械总厂全体职工在抗美援朝运动中积极开展增产节约运动，提前两个月零两天完成一九五二年度国家的生产任务，并且提前八天超额百分之十二完成增产节约计划，今后要更加倍地努力生产，支援前线。农业劳动模范殷维臣说，他们村成立了一个农业生产合作社，单位面积的产量比解放前增加四倍，过去缺吃少穿的贫农、雇农，现在都有了余粮。这幸福的日子是和志愿军在前线打美国侵略者分不开的，他们争取一九五三年再增产一成半，支援最可爱的人。妇女代表王立华说，妇女们都深深知道保卫和平幸福生活的是谁，她们崇文区的家庭妇女决心要巩固现在的五十一个读报组，加强时事宣传，搞好爱国卫生运动，加强优抚工作，解决烈属和军属生活上的困难，使前方战士们能更安心地为保卫和平而战。
    会议进行中，中国人民抗美援朝总会委托北京市抗美援朝分会将三面锦旗送给参加中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团的新中华评剧工作团、北京曲艺工作团和首都曲艺工作团。
    北京市抗美援朝代表会议全体代表，最后一致通过了以张奚若主席报告为基础的、关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的决议。
