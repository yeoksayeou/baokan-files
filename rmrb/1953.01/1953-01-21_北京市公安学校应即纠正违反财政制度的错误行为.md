    Beijing Public Security School Should Immediately Correct Erroneous Behavior Violating Financial Regulations

    The Beijing Public Security School is constantly violating financial regulations. The school's loudspeaker was not broken, yet it privately used over 11 million yuan of other funds to purchase a new one, leaving the old one unused. The school also withheld a portion of the public miscellaneous expense surplus that should have been turned over, using it to buy a pair of leather gloves for each section chief-level cadre. In addition, it evaded cash management, arbitrarily withdrawing large amounts of cash from the bank and handing it over to the administrator for private safekeeping. For example, on November 1st of last year, it paid the administrator 4 million yuan in one go, but only used slightly more than 700,000 yuan on that day. I believe that the leadership of the Beijing Public Security School should immediately correct this erroneous practice.　Cheng Zu

    北京市公安学校应即纠正违反财政制度的错误行为
    北京市公安学校不断违反财政制度。该校的扩音机并没有坏，竟私自动用其他经费一千一百多万元新购一具，把旧的搁起来不用了。该校还把应该上缴的公杂费结余扣下一部分，给每个科长级干部购一双皮手套。此外，又逃避现金管理，随便把大量现金从银行提出，交给管理员私人保管。如去年十一月一日，就一次付给管理员四百万元，实际当日仅用七十多万元。我认为：北京市公安学校领导方面应该立即纠正这种错误做法。　程卒
