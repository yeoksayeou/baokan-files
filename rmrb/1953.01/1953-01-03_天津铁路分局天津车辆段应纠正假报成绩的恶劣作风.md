To the Editor:

    The Tianjin Rolling Stock Depot of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau still has the evil practice of falsely reporting achievements.

    On November 15, 1952, at 18:30, the depot completed work on car No. 冖55769, but in the report, they stated that it was completed at 18:00 on the same day. When the depot was repairing car No. 攵7705, we saw them still working at 18:20 on November 21st, but they had already notified the station that it was repaired by 17:30, and the acceptance inspector even stamped the document to certify that it was repaired by 17:30.

    The depot also falsely reported the time of detaining cars for inspection and repair. Worker Xiao Jiazhen said: Car No. 冖55498, which arrived from Nancang to Tianjin for inspection and repair on November 19th, was detained before 17:00, but the recorder falsely reported it as being detained after 18:00 in order to reduce the number of unentered inspection and repair cars by one.

    This evil practice of deceiving superiors and falsely reporting achievements is inseparable from the Tianjin Rolling Stock Depot's leadership cadres' single-minded pursuit of tasks and their lack of emphasis on overall interests. I hope that the leading cadres of the Tianjin Rolling Stock Depot will quickly investigate and correct this, and make a profound self-criticism.

    天津铁路分局天津车辆段应纠正假报成绩的恶劣作风
    编辑同志：天津铁路分局天津车辆段仍有假报成绩的恶劣作风。
    该段在一九五二年十一月十五日十八点半做完冖五五七六九号车，但做报告时，却说：当日十八点做完。该段修理攵七七○五号车时，我们看见在十一月二十一日十八点二十分还在干活，但他们早已通知车站说十七点三十分修竣，验收员还盖章证明十七点三十分修竣。
    该段还假报扣留检修车时刻。工人萧家珍说：十一月十九日从南仓到天津的冖五五四九八号检修车，是在十七点以前扣完的，但是记录员为了减少一辆未入线的检修车，则假报为十八点以后扣完的。
    这种欺骗上级假报成绩的恶劣作风，是和天津车辆段领导干部的单纯任务观点，不重视整体利益分不开的。我希望天津车辆段的领导干部迅速检查纠正，并作深刻检讨。  郭中霞
