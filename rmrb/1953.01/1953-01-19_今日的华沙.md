Today, everyone who goes to Warsaw will be amazed by the rapid changes in the face of this city, which once suffered barbaric destruction. When the Soviet Army and the Polish People's Army liberated Warsaw on January 17, 1945, 85% of the city's houses had been destroyed by the German fascist occupiers. All cultural relics, historical sites, hospitals, schools, hydro-electric facilities, transportation, and factories were almost completely burned or bombed. Not a single one of the five beautiful bridges across the Vistula River survived. The looted Warsaw had no streets, was sparsely populated, and was full of ruins and broken walls. The entire city was almost reduced to a pile of rubble.

But today's Warsaw has a new look. Everywhere you look, there is no street where you can't see construction scaffolding and elevators, and no corner where you can't hear the roar of stone crushers, excavators, and bulldozers. New boulevards have been opened up from the rubble, and magnificent buildings and neat houses have been rebuilt on the ruins. Public vehicles carrying passengers shuttle back and forth, and the joyful songs of children echo again in the streets and squares. Warsaw has become a prosperous and vibrant city, and it has once again become the political, economic, and cultural center of Poland.

The rapid recovery and prosperity of Warsaw today is the result of the hard work and diligent labor of Warsaw residents and the people of Poland over the eight years since liberation. Almost all adult residents of Warsaw, from the age of eighteen to sixty, participated in the reconstruction of their city.

In the past eight years, Warsaw has built 200,000 houses and repaired 85,000 houses. Modern residential areas are developing, with the latest equipment. Each district has its own cultural facilities, department stores, public canteens, schools, and nurseries. Among these residential areas, the Marszałkowska Residential District is particularly important, as it will become the residence of 45,000 people. In July last year, the main construction of the Marszałkowska Residential District was completed, and many workers and their families happily moved into their new homes.

Warsaw, whose industry was 90% destroyed, has now become the industrial center of Poland. A large number of factories built and repaired since 1945 have already started operation. These factories include the Żerań Automobile Factory, the Warsaw Textile Factory, the Warsaw Printing Factory, and the "Ursus" Tractor Factory. They supply the national economy and the people's livelihood with a large number of excellent products. In the near future, Warsaw will also build a steel plant, a machine tool factory, a glass factory, and a building materials factory.

In terms of urban transportation, public utilities, and cultural undertakings, there has also been great development in the past eight years: two bridges, each 800 meters long, have been built, and 700 kilometers of water pipes and more than 400 kilometers of sewers have been laid. The number of hospitals in Warsaw has increased from fourteen to twenty-four, the number of theaters and cinemas has increased by twenty-seven, and the number of primary and secondary school students has increased by three and a half times. Warsaw now has sixteen institutions of higher education with nearly 30,000 students.

An important project in the reconstruction of Warsaw is the construction of an underground railway. By 1955, ten stations of the underground railway will be completed and opened to traffic. Electric trains with a speed of 60 kilometers per hour will run on the completed lines, and they will be able to transport 1.5 million passengers every day.

In the center of Warsaw, the most magnificent building in the city – the Palace of Culture and Science – is currently under construction. It is 30 stories high, 212 meters wide, and has a total volume of 800,000 cubic meters. In front of it, there will be a large square 700 meters long and 175 meters wide. This Palace of Culture and Science is a precious gift from the Soviet Union to the Polish people. It was designed by Soviet architects, with all construction materials supplied by the Soviet Union and assisted by Soviet workers. The entire project will be completed in July 1955. The steel frame of the building has now been erected to the sixth floor. The construction of the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science demonstrates the Soviet people's great help to the Polish people in rebuilding Warsaw and symbolizes the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples.

The construction work in Warsaw is progressing at a rapid pace. The new Warsaw will be three times larger than before the war. Green lawns and parks full of flowers will cover an area of 3,800 hectares, which will make it more beautiful and become a city of peace and socialism.

    今日的华沙
    今天去到华沙的每一个人，都要为这个曾经遭受过野蛮毁坏的城市面貌的迅速改变而感到惊奇。在一九四五年一月十七日苏军和波兰人民军队解放华沙的时候，这个城市的百分之八十五的房屋已为德国法西斯占领者所毁，所有的文物、古迹、医院、学校、水电、交通和工厂，几乎全被焚烧或炸毁，横跨维斯杜拉河上的五座美丽的桥梁也没有一座幸存。被洗劫后的华沙没有街道，人烟稀少，满眼皆是断垣残壁，整个城市几乎变成了一个瓦砾堆。
    但今天的华沙已经面目一新了。人们展眼望去，没有一条街道上看不到建筑房屋的营造架和升降机，没有一个角落里听不到碾石机、挖泥机、堆土机的轰轰响声；新的林荫大道已从瓦砾堆里开辟出来，巍峨的大厦和整齐的住宅已在废墟上重建起来，搭载着乘客的公共车辆穿梭而过，儿童们的欢乐歌声重又荡漾在街头与广场。华沙已成为一个繁荣的、生气勃勃的城市了，它又重新成为波兰全国的政治、经济与文化中心了。
    华沙的迅速恢复和今天的繁荣，是由于华沙居民和波兰全国人民在解放后八年来艰苦努力、勤奋劳动的结果。从十八岁到六十岁的华沙成年居民，几乎都参加了自己的城市的重建工作。
    八年来，华沙已建筑了二十万间住房，修缮了八万五千间住房。现代化的住宅区在发展着，它们拥有最新的设备，每一个区都有自己的文化设施、百货公司、公共食堂、学校和托儿所。在这些住宅区中特别重要的是马沙科斯卡住宅区，它将成为四万五千人的住所。去年七月，马沙科斯卡住宅区的主要工程部分已经完工，许多工人和他们的家属都喜气洋洋地迁入了自己的新居。
    工业曾被毁灭百分之九十的华沙，现在又成为波兰全国的工业中心了。自一九四五年以后兴建和修复起来的大批工厂已经开工了。这些工厂中包括热兰汽车工厂、华沙纺织工厂、华沙印刷工厂、“乌尔苏斯”拖拉机工厂等。它们以大量的优良的产品供应着国民经济和人民生活的需要。不久的将来，华沙还要建立起炼钢厂、工作母机制造厂、玻璃厂和建筑器材厂。
    在城市交通、公用与文化事业方面，八年来也有了很大的发展：建筑了两座长达八百公尺的大桥，铺设了七百公里的水管和四百多公里的阴沟。华沙市内的医院已由十四个增为二十四个，剧院和电影院增加了二十七所，中小学生增加了三倍半，现在华沙共有十六所高等教育机关和将近三万名学生。
    重建华沙的一项重要工程是兴建地下铁道。到一九五五年的时候，地下铁道十个车站将要落成开放，时速六十公里的电气火车将在完工后的路线上行驶，它们每天将可运送一百五十万名乘客。
    在华沙的市中心，目前正在建筑一座全城最壮丽的宏大建筑物——文化科学宫，它高达三十层，宽二百十二公尺，总容积为八十万立方公尺。在它的面前，将有一个长七百公尺、宽一百七十五公尺的大广场。这座文化科学宫是苏联赠给波兰人民的珍贵礼物，它由苏联建筑师设计，由苏联供给一切建筑材料并由苏联工人协助来建筑。它的全部工程将在一九五五年七月完成。现在大厦的钢骨已经架设到第六层了。华沙文化科学宫的建筑，表现了苏联人民对波兰人民重建华沙的巨大帮助，也象征了苏波人民的兄弟般的友谊。
    华沙的建设工作正以迅速的步伐进展着，新的华沙将比战前的面积扩大三倍，仅茵绿的草地和盛开鲜花的公园就要占地三千八百公顷，这将使它变得更加美丽，而成为一个和平与社会主义的城市。
