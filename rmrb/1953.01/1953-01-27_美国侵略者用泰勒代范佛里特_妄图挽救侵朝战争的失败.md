Title: American Aggressors Replace Van Fleet with Taylor in a Futile Attempt to Salvage Defeat in the Korean War

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: The U.S. Department of the Army announced on the 23rd the removal of General Van Fleet from his post as commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, replacing him with Maxwell Taylor.

Although the U.S. Department of the Army claimed that Van Fleet was being replaced because he had reached “retirement” age, the reality is that Van Fleet was unable to achieve military victory in Korea. Shortly after the Korean armistice negotiations began in 1951, Van Fleet brazenly stated: "The only medicine for the armistice negotiations is the victory of the United Nations forces." However, the facts of more than a year have proven that Van Fleet's boasting has been exposed. His series of "military pressures" and "offensives" have all failed, and the American aggressors have not been able to gain any advantage in the armistice negotiations. Especially after the Dood Incident occurred in the Koje Island POW camp, Van Fleet failed to conceal the truth in time, so that the American aggressors' conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war was completely exposed. Therefore, Clark relieved him of his power to control the rear transportation area of the U.S. military in Korea. Washington was increasingly dissatisfied with Van Fleet. As early as last September, news came from Tokyo that Van Fleet would be replaced. Van Fleet repeatedly stated that he did not want to be replaced. United Press reporter Merrick reported from Seoul on September 30th last year that according to "reliable sources close to Van Fleet," Van Fleet had written to the U.S. Department of Defense, "requesting that he remain as commander of the Eighth Army until the Korean War ends, and if he is to be replaced before the Korean War ends, he is willing to retire."

The American "World Telegram and Sun" revealed on October 25th last year that the U.S. State Department "had put pressure on the Army to keep Van Fleet in Korea. General Van Fleet himself also wanted to stay. It is expected that when he is transferred back to the country, he will request retirement. If General Clark argues for Van Fleet, he may retain his position. But General Clark has never liked his field commander very much."

In order to prove that he was not completely helpless in Korea, Van Fleet specifically launched an offensive towards the Kimhwa area last October. However, the result was contrary to Van Fleet's expectations. This offensive further proved that he would never be able to achieve victory in the Korean War. Therefore, although Van Fleet had used the American election campaign to promote himself, saying that "I still hope that we can achieve a military victory in Korea, so as to restore the reputation of the United States in the Far East and the world," and "My job has always been to overcome difficulties and achieve victory," he finally failed to keep his position as commander of the Eighth Army and had to roll out of Korea under the guise of "retirement."

Washington's replacement of Van Fleet shows that the American aggressors are still trying to salvage the failure of the Korean War through military adventures. The Associated Press reported last year: "An Army Department official said: The timing of Van Fleet's dismissal may be determined by factors related to the Korean armistice negotiations." Agence France-Presse also reported that Washington sources believe that Van Fleet's transfer "may be considered a change in the United Nations strategy." This indication can also be seen from Taylor's appointment as commander of the U.S. Eighth Army. According to American news agencies, Taylor is a mad warmonger like Ridgway. He commanded a paratrooper division in two landing operations in Western Europe during World War II. This is clearly related to the amphibious offensive that the American aggressors are now actively planning. According to United Press, Taylor will soon come to the Far East after U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins. There are also reports that he plans to visit the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang in early next month. But Taylor obviously has no way to win the Korean War, just like Van Fleet and Eisenhower. When he was entertaining reporters in Washington, he said that he hoped "to fully absorb Van Fleet's approach." It is very clear that Taylor wants to use the "Van Fleet approach" that has already been thwarted to continue and expand the Korean War, and his fate will only be worse than Van Fleet's.

### 美国侵略者用泰勒代范佛里特  妄图挽救侵朝战争的失败

    美国侵略者用泰勒代范佛里特
    妄图挽救侵朝战争的失败
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国陆军部在二十三日宣布免除侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特的职务，改由马克斯韦尔·泰勒继任。
    虽然美国陆军部宣称范佛里特之所以被更换，是因为他已经到了“退休”的年龄，但实际上这是因为范佛里特无法在朝鲜取得军事上的胜利。在一九五一年朝鲜停战谈判开始以后不久，范佛里特曾经大言不惭地说：“停战谈判的唯一药剂，就是联合国军队的胜利。”但是一年多的事实证明，范佛里特的牛皮吹破了，他的一连串“军事压力”和“攻势”全都破了产，美国侵略者在停战谈判中也没有能够占着便宜。特别在巨济岛战俘营中发生杜德事件以后，范佛里特没有能够及时地隐瞒事情的真相，以致美国侵略者强迫扣留战俘的阴谋彻底暴露，因此克拉克解除了他的控制朝鲜美军后方交通区的权力。华盛顿对范佛里特越来越不满意了。早在去年九月间，东京方面就传出了将要调换范佛里特的消息。范佛里特为此曾一再表示他不愿意被调换。合众社记者麦利克在去年九月三十日从汉城报道说，据“接近范佛里特的可靠人士”说，范佛里特曾经写信给美国国防部，“要求在朝鲜战争未停止以前，仍由他担任第八军军长职务，假若在朝鲜战争停止以前就要调换他，则他愿意退休”。美国
    “世界电讯与太阳报”在去年十月二十五日就透露美国陆军部要用泰勒来代替范佛里特。该报说，美国国务院“曾经对陆军施用压力，要陆军把范佛里特留在朝鲜。范佛里特将军自己也想留下去。预料当调回国内后，他将请求退休。如果克拉克将军替范佛里特力争，那末他可能保全他的职位。但是克拉克将军一直不太喜欢他的这位野战司令官”。
    范佛里特为了证明他在朝鲜还不是一筹莫展，特地在去年十月间发动了向金化地区的进攻。但是结果和范佛里特的预期相反，这次攻势进一步证明他永远无法取得朝鲜战争的胜利。因此，虽然范佛里特曾经利用美国的竞选运动进行自我宣传，说什么“我仍然希望我们能在朝鲜获得军事上的胜利，藉以恢复美国在远东与全世界的声望”，“我的工作一向是克服困难，取得胜利”，但是他终于没有能够保住他的第八军军长的职位，只好在“退休”的幌子下面滚出朝鲜去了。
    华盛顿更换范佛里特，表明美国侵略者还企图在军事冒险中挽救侵朝战争的失败。美联社在去年就报道说：“一位陆军部官员说：免除范佛里特职务的时机可能决定于与朝鲜停战谈判有关的因素。”法新社也报道说，华盛顿人士认为范佛里特的调动“可能被认为是联合国战略的改变”。这一迹象从泰勒的被任命为美军第八军军长也可以看出来。据美国通讯社报道，泰勒是和李奇微一样疯狂好战的人，他在第二次世界大战中曾经指挥伞兵师参加西欧的两次登陆战。这显然和美国侵略者现在正在积极筹划的两栖攻势有关。据合众社报道，泰勒不久即将继美国陆军参谋长柯林斯之后来远东。还有消息说，他准备在下月初旬访问台湾国民党匪帮。但是泰勒显然也和范佛里特和艾森豪威尔一样，没有任何打赢朝鲜战争的办法。他在华盛顿招待记者时说，他希望“能够完全汲取范佛里特的一套”。十分明显，泰勒想用已经碰了壁的“范佛里特的一套”来继续和扩大侵朝战争，他的命运只有比范佛里特更糟一些。
