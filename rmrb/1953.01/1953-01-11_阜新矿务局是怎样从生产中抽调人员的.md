How Fuxin Mining Bureau Withdraws Personnel from Production
Song Zheng

Since the establishment of the Capital Construction Company in 1951, the Fuxin Mining Bureau has paid attention to drawing personnel from production to enrich and improve the capital construction institutions. From August 1951 to November 1952, a total of 72 technical personnel and 181 management cadres were extracted. In 1952 alone, a total of 2,204 employees were extracted. As a result of this withdrawal, the capital construction organization of the Fuxin Mining Bureau became a relatively strong organization capable of undertaking the huge tasks of 1952. This was the determining factor for the smooth completion of the very complex and arduous capital construction tasks of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in 1952. At the same time, the Fuxin Mining Bureau also sent 40 cadres and 52 technical personnel to higher leading organs. Moreover, those who were drawn out were mostly outstanding personnel. The Fuxin Mining Bureau did not have smooth sailing when withdrawing this group of people. It encountered considerable resistance in the middle and carried out many struggles.

Fear of affecting production

In April 1952, the Northeast Industrial Department issued instructions to strengthen capital construction. The Fuxin Mining Bureau is also one of the key points of capital construction in the Northeast. Leading cadres at all levels of the Mining Bureau have a certain understanding in principle of the great significance of capital construction. However, when it comes to withdrawing their own cadres, they can't figure it out. A mine manager once talked to me about his feelings at the time. He said that at that time, the biggest concern was that he was afraid that things would not be easy to handle and affect production if there were fewer people. And what the higher authorities wanted were the best ones. Therefore, he always felt that the higher authorities did not take care of the difficulties below. If the good ones were all taken away, who would be responsible for the collapse of production! Therefore, he came up with various ways to bargain with the higher authorities, asking to delay a little, and leave after bringing out a few apprentices; asking to replace a few, and not to withdraw all the good ones, and so on. This situation has also occurred in other production units. Some responsible cadres feel that they will be criticized if they do not send cadres, and they will also be criticized if production is affected after they are sent away. Anyway, they will be criticized on one side, so it is better not to send them. Some people spread out the list of employees to the leading side to calculate. Individual cadres even spread their hands and said, "Look, I only have so many people!" when the above assigns tasks.

The key lies in the leadership's determination

In this case, the leadership of the Fuxin Mining Bureau is generally firm. Not only must they be withdrawn within the time limit and in full numbers, but if the quality of the people who are transferred is not good, the director often orders them to be returned and replaced. Why can the leading cadres of the Fuxin Mining Bureau not be shaken by the cries of the cadres below? First of all, it lies in their correct understanding of capital construction. In the words of a responsible comrade of the Fuxin Mining Bureau: For the larger-scale construction in the future, this group of people who are transferred are the figures who are opening up the base area, and they must be the backbone. Secondly, it is also because they correctly analyzed the situation at that time: In the three years of recovery work, the production of the mine has gradually become regular and finalized. They felt that a new force had grown up, and if a group of people were withdrawn, the new force would continue to grow. Therefore, the leading comrades of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, on the one hand, explained to the subordinate units that there is a huge potential force in the enterprise, carried out mobilization, and on the other hand, issued orders to resolutely withdraw. Of course, when withdrawing personnel, the leadership also considered production. The leadership had repeatedly considered in advance those people whose production was only temporarily difficult, those people whose production was really affected, those people who could better exert their strength in the capital construction department, and those people who were more suitable to stay in production. At the same time, after the withdrawal of personnel, responsible cadres at all levels also paid attention to providing more specific help in the problems in the work below and less general accusations and criticisms.

Production will not collapse

Facts have proved that the production has not only not been affected, but has continued to improve after a large number of personnel were withdrawn. In 1951, the output of the Fuxin Mining Bureau increased by 39% compared with 1949, and in 1952 it was planned to increase to 67.5%; in 1951, the efficiency increased by 18% compared with 1949, and in 1952 (January to August) it increased by 29%; in 1951, the cost decreased by 14.9% compared with 1949, and in 1952 (January to July) it decreased by 26.1%. Some responsible cadres who were quite incomprehensible at the time now say: Many people have left, and there are difficulties. However, if you don't just sit there complaining, production will not collapse. In the past, everyone's biggest headache was the withdrawal of technical personnel. However, when the technical personnel are transferred, there will be a way. First, each mine has a group of university graduates who have been interning for a year or two as trainee technicians, and old workers who are technically skilled and experienced. After these people are promoted, many of them can independently take on some technical management work. After the technical pit leader of the Third Pit of Ping'an Mine was transferred, a chief surveyor in charge of surveying work was promoted, and the technical guidance work at the pit entrance was not affected at all. Second, giving full play to the enthusiasm of technical personnel in production positions and using manpower more reasonably can also solve many problems. Originally, there was an average of one to one and a half technical personnel who could independently solve problems at each pit entrance. At this time, it was changed to one full-time engineer with one or two trainee technicians in charge of two pit entrances. In production, necessary adjustments can also be made according to primary and secondary. Before the start of the Ping'an Shaft, the Mining Bureau once withdrew more than 60% of the skilled workers in a pit entrance of the Haizhou Mine. The Haizhou Mine immediately drew a group of workers from the pit wood factory who were more familiar with the situation under the pit to supplement the pit, so that production was not greatly affected. Third, sometimes when more important technical workers and technical personnel are transferred, it may not be possible to immediately transfer people to fill the vacancy. At this time, it is necessary to persuade everyone to take some temporary measures or improve work methods to solve the problem. Once, a few workers who were watching water pumps, air compressors, and other machinery at the Ping'an Mine were transferred away, and it was impossible to find replacement workers for a while. At this time, the mine party, on the one hand, transferred some young workers to train them, and on the other hand, mobilized the remaining skilled workers to sacrifice rotating shifts in a short period of time and adopt a contract system to train new workers. In June 1952, the production section chief of the Ping'an Mine was transferred away, and the mine manager of the mine took more care of the work of the production section. The production section adopted a clear division of labor to strengthen everyone's sense of responsibility; when encountering major technical problems, the technical pit leaders were concentrated to discuss solutions. Therefore, in the past few months, the technical guidance work of the Ping'an Mine has not been weakened.

The large-scale withdrawal of personnel has indeed increased some difficulties in the work of responsible cadres at all levels of the Mining Bureau, but it has also improved their ideological level and deeply realized the harm of departmentalism and conservative thinking. Some units have begun to pay attention to cultivating reserve forces. Some units have been able to boldly use and promote new forces. The Capital Construction Company distributed a group of university students in the summer of 1952. When they discovered that there was a conservative tendency in the use of them, they immediately conducted an inspection and changed the method, trying to give this group of university students practical training opportunities, and designated one person to follow one engineer in order to improve their professional skills more quickly. Soon, some outstanding students were able to work independently. The leading cadres of the Ping'an Mine have also purposefully and systematically designated some technical pit leaders and trainee technicians below to sign contracts, responsible for teaching them to conduct technical guidance independently within a certain period of time, so that the current technical pit leaders can be transferred when necessary.

    阜新矿务局是怎样从生产中抽调人员的
    宋琤
    阜新矿务局从一九五一年基本建设公司成立起，就注意了从生产中抽调人员，充实并健全基本建设机构。从一九五一年八月到一九五二年十一月共抽出技术人员七十二名，管理干部一百八十一名。单以一九五二年计算，则共抽出职工二、二○四名。这样抽调的结果，使阜新矿务局的基本建设机构成为一个能够担当一九五二年巨大任务的较为强大的机构。这是一九五二年阜新矿务局得以顺利完成十分复杂艰巨的基本建设任务的决定因素。与此同时，阜新矿务局还向上级领导机关输送了四十名干部和五十二名技术人员。而且，抽调出来的又大都是较为优秀的人员。阜新矿务局在抽调这批人员时，并不是一帆风顺的，中间曾经遇到了相当大的抗拒，进行了不少的斗争。
    害怕影响生产
    一九五二年四月，东北工业部发出了加强基本建设工作的指示。阜新矿务局又是东北区基本建设的重点之一。矿务局各级领导干部对于基本建设的重大意义在原则上是有一定认识的。但是，一碰到抽调自己的干部就想不通了。有一位矿长曾经和我谈起当时他自己的心情。他说，那时候最大的顾虑是害怕人少了，事情不好办，影响生产。而上面要的呢，又偏偏都是最好的。因而，总觉得上面实在不照顾下面的困难，好的都抽走了，生产垮了谁负责呢！因此就想出各种办法向上面讨价还价，要求迟一点，带出几个徒弟再走；要求换上几个，不要全抽好的等。这种情况在其它生产单位也都曾发生。有的负责干部感觉到不送干部要受批评，送走了生产受影响也要受批评，反正得受一头批评，还是不送的好。有的人把职工名单摊出来给领导方面算账。个别干部甚至在上面分配任务时，两手一摊说：“看吧，我就这么多人了！”关键在于领导的决心
    在这种情况下，阜新矿务局的领导方面一般是坚定不移的。不但要限期如数抽调出来，而且调出来的人质量不好，也常由局长下命令退回去再换。阜新矿务局的领导干部为什么能不为下面干部的叫唤动摇呢？首先，在于他们对基本建设工作有了正确的认识。用阜新矿务局的一位负责同志的话形容：对于今后更大规模的建设来说，抽调的这一批人是开辟根据地的人物，必须是骨干。其次，也还因为他们正确地分析了当时的情况：在三年的恢复工作中，矿山的生产已经逐渐走向正规、定型。他们感觉到，一批新生的力量已经生长起来，抽出一批人，新生的力量将会继续成长。因此，阜新矿务局的领导同志，一面向所属单位说明企业中存在巨大的潜在力量，进行动员，一面下命令坚决抽调。当然，在抽调人员时，领导方面也并不是不考虑生产的，调那些人生产上只是暂时的困难，调那些人生产真正要受影响；那些人调到基本建设部门能够更好的发挥力量，那些人留在生产方面更为合适，领导方面事先都曾再三考虑。同时，在抽调人员后，各级负责干部对下面工作中的问题也都注意了多做具体帮助，少做一般的指责批评。生产垮不了
    事实证明：大批的人员被抽走了，生产不仅没有受到影响，而且不断地提高。一九五一年阜新矿务局的产量较一九四九年提高了百分之三十九，一九五二年按照计划则提高到百分之六十七点五；一九五一年的效率较一九四九年提高百分之十八，一九五二年（一至八月）则提高百分之二十九；一九五一年的成本较一九四九年降低百分之十四点九，一九五二年（一至七月）则降低百分之二十六点一。有些当时思想颇为不通的负责干部，现在也都说：人走了很多，困难是有的。但是，假如你不是只坐在那里埋怨叫苦的话，生产是垮不了的。以前大家最头疼的是抽走技术人员。但是，当技术人员调走之后，办法也就有了。第一、各矿都有一批大学毕业的实习了一两年的见习技术员，和技术熟练、经验丰富的老工人。这些人提拔上来以后，不少人都可以独立担当一些技术管理工作。平安矿三坑的技术坑长调走后，把一个负责测量工作的主测提拔上来，坑口的技术指导工作根本没有受到影响。第二、充分发挥生产岗位上的技术人员的积极性，更合理地使用人力也可以解决不少问题。原来平均一个坑口有一个到一个半能够独立解决问题的技术人员。这时，就改为一个专责工程师带上一两个见习技术员负责两个坑口。在生产中也可以分别主要次要进行必要的调剂。平安竖井开工前，矿务局曾一次抽走了海州矿一个坑口的百分之六十以上的熟练工人。海州矿立即从坑木厂抽出一批比较熟悉坑下情况的工人补充到坑下，使生产得以不受很大影响。第三、有时抽调了比较重要的技术工人和技术人员时，也许无法立刻调人补上缺额，这时候便需要说服大家，采取一些临时的办法，或者是改善工作方法来解决问题。有一次，平安矿看守水泵、压风机等机械的工人被调走了几个，一时找不出接替的工人。这时，矿方便一方面调来了一些年轻的工人加以培养，一方面动员留下的熟练工人，在短时期内牺牲轮休，采取合同制的办法培养新工人。一九五二年六月，平安矿的生产科长被调去了，该矿的矿长便更多的照顾生产科的工作，生产科内采取明确分工的办法，以加强大家的责任感；遇到较大的技术问题，则集中技术坑长开会讨论解决。因此几个月来，平安矿的技术指导工作并没有削弱。
    大批地抽调人员确实也给矿务局的各级负责干部的工作增加了一些困难，但是也提高了他们的思想水平，深刻地认识到本位主义与保守思想的危害。有的单位已经开始注意培养后备力量。有的单位已能放手使用与提拔新生力量。基本建设公司一九五二年夏天分到了一批大学生，当他们发现了在使用方面有保守倾向以后，立即进行了检查，改变了办法，尽量给这批大学生以实际锻炼的机会，并且指定一个人跟一个工程师，以便更快地提高业务能力。不久，有些优秀的学生就可以独立工作了。平安矿的领导干部也已经有目的有步骤的指定一些技术坑长和下面的见习技术员签订合同，负责在一定时期内教会他们独立进行技术指导，以便必要时抽调现在的技术坑长。
