Shanghai's industries saved a lot of copper last year. According to statistics from more than ten industries after adopting more than thirty kinds of new substitutes, a total of 3,200 tons of copper materials were saved, worth 192 billion yuan. These saved copper materials can be used for national defense construction and economic construction that require copper.

After adopting substitutes to save copper materials, the cost of many products has been reduced, and sales have expanded. After the cultural and educational supplies industry replaced the copper frame of rubber stamps with an iron frame, the selling price of rubber stamps was reduced by 25%, and monthly sales increased from 1,700 dozen to 2,300 dozen. The hot water bottle industry replaced the copper lid with a bakelite lid, and used iron sheet, etc. to replace the copper shoulder and copper trimming on the bottle shell, which reduced the cost by 12%. After the Maochang Dyeing and Weaving Factory replaced the purple copper plate of the dryer drum with an iron plate, the manufacturing cost of the drum was reduced by 75%, while the acid resistance performance was improved by 40% compared with the past. After the flashlight shell body was changed from copper material to other raw materials, 822 tons of copper were saved last year. What is not often noticed is that after the water-absorbing spring and clip on fountain pens were replaced with other metals, 360 tons of copper were saved throughout the year.

    上海各工业去年节约很多铜
    上海市各工业在去年一年内，节约了很多铜。据十多个行业采用了三十多种新代替品后的统计，共节约了铜料达三千二百吨，价值一千九百二十亿元。这些节约下来的铜料，可以用到必需用铜的国防建设和经济建设上去。
    采用代替品来节约铜料后，许多产品的成本降低了，销路扩大了。文教用品工业用铁皮架代替橡皮印章的铜架后，橡皮印章的卖价减低了百分之二十五，月销量由过去的一千七百打，增加到二千三百打。热水瓶工业用电木盖代替铜盖，用铁皮等代替瓶壳上的铜肩、铜甩，成本就降低了百分之十二。茂昌染织厂用铁板代替烘干机滚筒的紫铜板后，滚筒的制造成本降低了百分之七十五，而耐酸的效能反而较前提高了百分之四十。手电筒壳身从过去用铜料改为其他原料后，去年就节省下八百二十二吨铜。不常为人们所注意的，自来水笔上的吸水弹簧、套挂，改用其他金属来代替后，全年也节省下三百六十吨铜。　（新华社）
