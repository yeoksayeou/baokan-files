Like drinking a cup of sweet spring water,
Like listening to a magnificent movement,
Everyone in the hall stood up and looked up,
Watching the speaker return to the podium.
The golden dome and jade pillars of the hall shone brightly,
The old curtains also regained their glory,
The lamps on all sides shone on him together,
Shining on Korneichuk, bathed in light.
All the iron filings were attracted by the magnet,
All eyes in the hall focused on this Soviet man,
Countless eyes revealed gratitude and trust,
How many hearts flew to the Kremlin!
The two hundred members of the presidium stepped aside,
He is the great pillar of the Hall of Peace, standing in the center.
A burst of applause was louder than a summer night's rain,
As if the whole world was applauding him.
The Russian language, every word decisive:
"Peace is the only desire of the Soviet people,
We have no doubts, we are not afraid,
We firmly believe that life will overcome death!"
These words are not spoken by him alone,
But the powerful union of sixteen republics,
It is all the men and women there who labor for peace,
Behind them stands the great Stalin.
They erected tall power pylons on the riverbanks,
They created new seas in the deserts,
They called for forests to stand up and block the dry wind,
They sculpted the dreams of mankind for thousands of years.
The speaker pointed out the path of some other people:
They see war as a profitable business,
Every drop of blood is their pure profit,
Their only hope is encephalitis and plague.
To the enemy, his words were as heavy as a hammer,
To friends, his words were as gentle as a spring breeze:
"The Soviet Union welcomes all proposals for peace!"
While saying this, he pressed his right hand on his left chest.
………………………………
The humble speaker repeatedly asked everyone to sit down,
But the long applause, everyone did not want to stop.
We must unite around this great pillar,
No one can separate the peace-loving people!

    和平殿堂的大柱
    ——考涅楚克在维也纳和平大会上演讲
  　袁水拍
    好像喝了一杯甘美的清泉，
    好像听完一支壮丽的乐章，
    全场的人站起来抬头眺望，
    看这演讲者回到主席台上。
    金顶玉柱的大厅霎那明亮，
    古旧的帏幕也恢复了辉煌，
    四面的灯儿一齐向他照射，
    照耀得考涅楚克满身是光。
    所有的铁屑都被磁石吸引，
    满场视线集中这苏维埃人，
    无数眼睛流露着感激和信任，
    多少颗心儿飞向克里姆林！
    主席团二百人侧身让开两边，
    他是和平殿堂的大柱，站在中央。
    一片掌声比夏夜的骤雨还响，
    仿佛全世界都在向他鼓掌。
    俄罗斯语言个个字斩钉截铁：
    “和平是苏联人民唯一愿望，
    我们没有怀疑，我们毫不恐慌，
    我们坚信生命一定战胜死亡！”
    说这话的决不是他一个人，
    是强大的十六个共和国联盟，
    是那儿全体和平劳动的男女，
    他们后面站着伟大的斯大林。
    他们使河岸上竖起电力的高塔，
    他们叫沙漠上出现新的海洋，
    他们呼唤森林站起来挡住旱风，
    他们塑捏出人类千年来的梦想。
    演讲者指出另一些人的道路：
    他们把战争看成赚钱的事业，
    每一滴鲜血是他们的纯利，
    唯一的指望是脑炎和鼠疫。
    对敌人，他的话铁锤般沉重，
    对朋友，他的话温柔如春风：
    “苏联欢迎一切和平的建议！”
    一边说一边把右手按在左胸。
    ………………………………
    谦逊的演讲者一再请大家坐下，
    但长久的鼓掌，人人不想停下。
    我们要团结在这大柱周围，
    谁也不能使和平人民分家！
