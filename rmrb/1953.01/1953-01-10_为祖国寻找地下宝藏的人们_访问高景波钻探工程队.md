    People Searching for Underground Treasures for the Motherland
    ——Visiting the Gao Jingbo Drilling Team
    Zhang Xiaoying
    It is now the coldest season, and arctic cold currents are attacking the Northeast. In such "dripping water turns to ice" days, the drilling team stands in the coldest places - on top of high mountains, deep valleys, and icy rivers, battling the earth's crust as usual, exploring for underground treasures for the motherland.
    I visited the Gao Jingbo Drilling Team.
    In a small house under an iron frame erected on the hillside, a group of young workers are connecting drill rods. With their agile operation, they send a pile of drill rods next to them into the drill in a moment. Then, they open the pressure cover of the water pump and scoop out the accumulated ice inside with their hands. The cold wind is pouring into the small house, and their hands are red with cold. At this time, even holding a lit cigarette would feel warm; but from their faces, one cannot see any expression of shrinking or displeasure due to the cold. Everywhere here is a tense but calm labor scene. A few days ago, this happened: Captain Gao was attending a meeting in Shenyang, and the workers knew that their task was urgent, so they moved an iron tower and engine room in the valley to a new drilling site on a hillside two miles away overnight, installed everything in less than twenty hours, and completed a task that would normally take three days.
    Only those who love the new society, love the motherland, and love the people's cause can do things that ordinary people cannot do. The Gao Jingbo Drilling Team has a total of one hundred and fifteen people. Except for the captain and two veteran technicians, all are young people aged eighteen to twenty-five. Among them, less than twenty have been working for two years. Captain Gao is a retired soldier who had never studied drilling before. But it is this group of people who have now mastered advanced technology and shouldered the heavy responsibility of building the motherland. In the past year, they have increased production efficiency by about four times, reduced production costs to 26% less than the national quota, and won the title of model drilling team.
    Their spirit of learning is commendable. Liu Zhaokun joined the drilling team last January. When he first came, he felt it was very interesting to see the roaring machines; but when he saw how complicated the machines were, he worried about not being able to learn. Just then, Captain Gao talked to him and said, "Large-scale economic construction is about to begin. The drilling industry must accelerate its development. You are a member of the Youth League and should seize the opportunity to learn and stand at the forefront!" From then on, he carried a book on drilling engineering theory with him every day when he went to work, and whenever he had time, he opened it and pondered over the machine: "Hmm! This is the 'feed handle', that is the 'pressure cover',..." After slowly figuring out the names of the parts, he studied the structure. Every time he saw others repairing the machine, he followed to watch. Once, the squad leader was repairing the water pump, and he saw so many pistons inside and didn't know where the water came in from, so he asked. The squad leader explained it to him in detail. But he didn't understand anything. When he went back, he opened the water pump diagram in the drilling theory book and looked at it over and over, but he still couldn't understand it. A few days later, the water pump stopped pumping water again, and the squad leader deliberately said, "Lao Liu, go and repair the water pump." Liu Zhaokun's face turned red with anxiety. The squad leader said, "Watch me!" and opened the pressure cover in two strokes, explaining to him while repairing. After spending more than twenty days, Liu Zhaokun finally understood the structure of the water pump, became even more interested, and said to the squad leader, "How about we sign a master-apprentice contract?" The squad leader agreed to his request. From then on, whenever he didn't understand something, he would ask the squad leader, and he would write down everything the squad leader said in his notebook. After work, he would open the book and study with his companions. He completed the six-month study task in four and a half months.
    The people's expectations of them are eager, and it is clear that simply mastering general technology cannot keep up with the requirements of the situation. It is necessary to continue to overcome all difficulties and raise technology to a new level. Therefore, Captain Gao proposed to promote the rapid drilling method (Soviet advanced experience). At that time, the only veteran technician in the team said angrily, "It's simply nonsense! During the puppet Manchukuo period, this machine could only turn up to ninety revolutions, how much faster can it go! Do you want to blow it up!" When the master said this, the young workers were even more worried: "...if it blows up, a new machine won't be delivered for a while, and we'll have to stare blankly!" Captain Gao immediately convened a meeting of activists to mobilize everyone to find a solution. The meeting came to the correct conclusion: "As long as the machine is inspected thoroughly beforehand, so that it has no problems at all, the rapid drilling method can definitely be implemented." Captain Gao personally led everyone to do the preparatory work and started a pilot project. Sure enough, the drilling speed quickly doubled.
    But the problem arose! In the past, iron sand was thrown into the drill rod, one handful at a time, three times every eight hours; after the rapid drilling method was implemented, because the drilling was faster, the iron sand was also consumed faster, and it had to be thrown six times every eight hours. As a result, the drilling speed increased, but the actual working time was greatly reduced. Some people said, "Soviet advanced experience is good, but the auxiliary time takes up too much." Soon, Captain Gao brought back from the company instructions to promote the Soviet advanced experience - the "one-time abrasive supply method" (a method of supplying iron sand once every eight hours). Some people said again, "That won't work, can you combine three meals into one?" However, at this time advanced ideas had begun to sprout; someone said: "Soviet advanced experience is never wrong! In the past, we all complained that our broken machines couldn't implement rapid drilling, but what about now?" Captain Gao immediately mobilized Youth League members to actively support this correct opinion and started a pilot project, which finally succeeded, and the iron facts educated everyone. Advanced ideas grew and strengthened day by day. When promoting the yellow mud slurry automatic well washing method (Soviet advanced experience), many people scrambled to experiment. Technical difficulties were overcome one by one.
    Soviet advanced experience gave the workers great inspiration. Xu Wanxu thought: "The Soviet working class has created a lot of advanced experience in order to build their country, we must catch up!" He began to pay attention to how to improve drilling speed. One day when changing the drill bit, he accidentally thought: "Reducing the number of times the drill bit is changed and increasing the normal operation time can also increase the drilling speed!" His attention was further focused on improving the drill bit. Finally, he found that the reason for changing the drill bit was that the triangular opening next to it was worn away, and the iron sand could not run out, could not squeeze through, and it was not easy to break the rock. So he created a drill bit with two triangular openings, one long and one short, so that when the small opening was worn away, there was still a large opening for the sand to come out. This saved the time of changing the drill bit. Due to the implementation of Soviet advanced experience and the discovery of many tricks, the normal operating time increased by more than half compared to the past. Good results have also been achieved in reducing costs.
    Large-scale economic construction will begin this year. Captain Gao told me: "The national task has been assigned! We need to increase the number of machines by several times, and we have to solve the problem of workers ourselves." He calculated that according to the current manpower, even if everyone was a squad leader, it would not be enough. But they had already made a plan to train apprentices. Master Hong Yuxian said: "We are studying, and we also want to shorten the six-month training period for apprentices to two months." Captain Gao said: "We not only want to train a large number of apprentices, but also made plans to further promote Soviet advanced experience, to achieve the greatest effect on rocks of different hardness. We will use this confidence to complete the new and glorious drilling task."

    为祖国寻找地下宝藏的人们
    ——访问高景波钻探工程队
    张效英
    现在正是严寒季节，北极的寒流袭击着东北大地。在这样“滴水成冰”的日子里，钻探队站在最冷的地方——高山、深谷和冰河的上面，照常跟地壳搏斗着，为祖国探索着地下宝藏。
    我访问了高景波钻探工程队。
    耸立在山坡上的一个铁架下面的小房里，一群年青工人，正在连接钻杆。他们敏捷的操作，一会儿就把排在旁边的一堆钻杆送到钻里去了。接着，他们又打开水泵的压盖，用手掏出里面的积冰。寒风正向小房里倾注，他们的双手冻得通红，这时，哪怕握着一支点燃着的纸烟，都会感觉温暖；但从他们的脸上却看不出一点因为寒冷而畏缩不快的表情。这里到处是一片紧张而又从容的劳动场面。前几天有过这么一回事：高队长正在沈阳开会，工人知道自己的任务紧急，就把山谷里的一个铁塔和机房连夜搬到两里远的山坡上的钻探新址，不到二十小时全安装起来，完成了平常三天的任务。
    只有热爱新社会、热爱祖国、热爱人民事业的人，才能作得出一般人所作不到的事情。高景波钻探工程队一共一百十五人。除开队长和两名老技工，都是十八岁到二十五岁的青年。其中够得上两年工龄的不到二十人。高队长是退伍的战士，过去根本没学过钻探。但就是这群人，现在已经掌握了先进的技术，担负起来了建设祖国的重担。一年来，他们把生产效率提高四倍左右，把生产成本减低到比国家的定额还少百分之二十六，获得了模范钻探队称号。
    他们学习的精神是可贵的。刘兆坤是去年一月参加钻探队的。刚来时，看见轰轰响的机器，感觉很有趣；但一看机器那么复杂，又担心学不会。正好这时高队长找他谈话，对他说：“大规模经济建设就要开始。钻探事业要加速发展。你是青年团员，应该抓紧学习，站在最前边！”从那时起，他每天上班都揣着一本钻探工程概论，得空就翻开来，对着机器琢磨：“嗯！这是‘给进把’，那是‘压盖’，……”把零件的名字慢慢弄清楚以后，再研究构造。每看到别人在修理机器，他就跟上去看。有一次班长在修理水泵，他看见里面那么多活塞，不知道从哪进水，就问开啦。班长向他详详细细地讲了一遍。但他一点也听不懂。回去，他打开钻探概论上的水泵图，翻来覆去地看，也没有弄通。过了几天，水泵又不出水了，班长故意说：“老刘，你去把水泵修理修理。”刘兆坤的脸急得通红，班长说：“你瞧着！”两下就打开了压盖，一面修理，一面给他讲。花了二十多天的工夫，刘兆坤终于懂得了水泵的构造，兴趣更高了，对班长说：“咱俩订个师徒合同好不？”班长答应了他的要求。从此，每逢不懂的地方，他就找班长问，把班长讲的都记在自己的笔记本上。下班后，翻开书本和同伙一起研究。他以四个半月完成了六个月的学习任务。
    人民对他们的期待是殷切的，光掌握一般技术显然赶不上形势的要求。必须继续战胜一切困难，把技术提高到新的水平。于是高队长提出要推行快速钻进法（苏联先进经验）。那时全队唯一的一位老技工气愤愤地说：“简直是扯蛋！伪满时，这机器最高只能转九十转，还要他快到哪里去！想把它炸掉啊！”师傅一这样讲，青年工人更担心：“……炸掉了，新机器一时还运不到，咱们只得干瞪眼！”高队长马上召开积极分子会议，动员大家想办法，会议作出了正确的结论：“只要事先把机器检查得好好的，叫它没有一点毛病，一定可以推行快速钻进法。”高队长又亲自领导大家作好准备工作，开始试点。果然，钻进速度很快地提高了一倍。
    但是问题出来啦！过去从钻杆里投铁砂子，一次一把，八小时三次；推行快速钻进法以后，因为钻得快，铁砂子也消耗得快，八小时要投六次。结果是钻进速度加快了，但正式工作的时间却大大减少。有人就说：“苏联先进经验好是好，就是辅助时间占得太多。”不久，高队长从公司带回去了推行苏联先进经验——“一次钻粒补给法”（八小时给一次铁砂子的办法）的指示。又有人说：“那哪行，三顿能并成一顿吃吗？”不过，这时先进思想已开始萌芽；有人说：“苏联先进经验就没有个错！过去我们都吵吵咱们这破烂机器不能实行快速钻进，现在怎么样？”高队长马上发动青年团员积极支持这种正确意见，开始试点，终于成功了，铁的事实教育了大家。先进思想一天天滋长，壮大了。在推广黄泥浆自动洗井法（苏联先进经验）时，许多人都抢着试验。技术困难都一一克服了。
    苏联先进经验，给工人很大启示。徐万绪想：“苏联工人阶级，为了建设自己的国家，创造很多先进经验，咱们一定要赶上去！”他开始注意怎样提高钻探速度的问题。有一天换钻头时，他偶而想到：“减少换钻头的次数，增加正常运转的时间，不也可以增加钻进速度吗！”他的注意力又进一步集中到改进钻头。最后他发现，要换钻头，是因为它旁边的三角口磨掉了，铁砂子跑不出来，挤不破，不好克取岩石。于是他创造出一长一短的两个三角口的钻头，小口磨掉了，还有大口出砂子。节省了更换钻头的时间。由于推行了苏联先进经验和找到了很多窍门，正常运转时间比过去增加一半以上。在降低成本方面也做出了很好的成绩。
    大规模经济建设从今年开始了。高队长告诉我：“国家的任务已经下来啦！要增加好几倍机器，工人要我们自己解决。”他算了算按目前的人力，都当班长也不够。但是他们早就作出了培养徒工的计划。洪玉宪老师傅说：“我们正在研究，还要把六个月培养出学徒的期限缩短到两个月。”高队长说：“我们不仅要大量培养徒工，还作出了进一步推广苏联先进经验的计划，在硬度不同的岩石上，都要收到最大效果。我们就用这个信心来完成新的、光荣的钻探任务。
