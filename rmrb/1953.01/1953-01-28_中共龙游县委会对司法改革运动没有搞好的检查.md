Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions:

    To the Editorial Board: The situation described in the letter "An Examination of Why the Judicial Reform Movement in Longyou County, Zhejiang, Was Not Properly Carried Out," published in the People's Daily on December 5th of last year, is entirely factual. The report on the investigation and handling results is as follows:

    Despite repeated instructions from the higher-level Party committee to strengthen leadership over the judicial reform movement, the County Committee did not give it sufficient importance. Although the County Committee discussed the judicial reform work and determined that Comrade Liu Yuzao (County Committee member, Deputy County Head) would be responsible, and Comrade Wang Rongkui (County Committee member, Public Security Bureau Chief) would be in charge of the specific implementation, since the beginning of the movement, due to insufficient investigation and a lack of core personnel, the first step of the judicial reform was not done well. The correct grasp of the policies and principles of judicial reform was not achieved, leading to the unfortunate incidents of Zhang Meixiang and Jian Zongde's suicides. This created an extremely negative impact among the people. In addition to making a profound self-criticism to the higher-level authorities and requesting punishment, the County Committee immediately instructed the Chengguan District, Huzhen District, and Xikou District, where judicial reform movements had already begun, to halt their progress. Comrade Wang Rongkui was instructed to make a profound self-criticism to the County Committee because he failed to take on the task assigned to him by the Party, failed to discover the problems early, and also failed to prevent the development of chaotic situations. The County Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and the County People's Government's Supervisory Committee's punishments for other relevant personnel are as follows: Zhang Shichang, Deputy Secretary of the Xikou District Committee, public warning within the Party; Fang Wenyuan, Deputy Dean of the County People's Court, removal from administrative position; Zeng Zhuohua, cadre of the County People's Court, administrative demerit; Luo Xiaomei, cadre of the County Women's Federation, major administrative demerit; Comrades Zhang Fangfu and others, given criticism and education. In addition, on December 26th of last year, Comrades Wang Rongkui and the newly appointed Deputy Dean of the County People's Court, Wei Dianhai, were responsible for organizing personnel to return to the scene of the incident to comprehensively educate the masses on the Party's policies and to make an on-the-spot self-criticism. This initially restored the people's morale and reversed the negative impact.

### 中共龙游县委会对司法改革运动没有搞好的检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共龙游县委会对司法改革运动没有搞好的检查
    编辑同志：人民日报在去年十二月五日刊载的“要检查浙江龙游县司法改革运动为什么没有搞好”一信内的情况，完全是事实。现在把检查处理结果报告如下：
    上级党委屡次指示加强司法改革运动的领导，县委会却重视不足。县委会对司法改革工作虽然进行了讨论，并确定由刘玉藻同志（县委委员，副县长）负责，由王荣魁同志（县委委员，公安局长）具体掌握，但自从运动开展以后，由于检查不深入，组织骨干力量不足，对司法改革的第一步就没有做好，正确掌握司法改革的政策和方针这一点也没有做到，以致发生张梅香与简宗德自杀等不幸事件。这在人民群众中造成极恶劣的影响。县委会除向上级深刻地检讨、请求给以处分外，并立即指示已开展司法改革运动的城关区、湖镇区和溪口区停止进行。对王荣魁同志，因为他没有把党交给他的任务担当起来，没有及早发现问题，也没有能制止混乱情况的发展，责令向县委会作深刻检讨。县委纪律检查委员会和县人民政府监察委员会对其他各有关人员的处分是：溪口区委会副书记张士昌，党内当众警告；县人民法院副院长方闻远，行政上撤职；县人民法院干部曾灼华，行政上记过处分；县妇联会干事罗晓梅，行政上记大过；张芳富等同志，给以批评教育。另外，去年十二月二十六日，由王荣魁同志和新任县人民法院副院长魏殿海同志负责组织人员，重到出事地点向群众全面地进行了党的政策教育，并当场作过检讨。初步恢复了群众情绪和挽回了不好的影响。  中共浙江省龙游县委会
