    The Third Engineering Department of the Central Second Ministry of Machine Building has 1,343 workers participating in winter training. It began on December 8th last year and has now completed class education and moved on to future-oriented education.

    This department is a newly established unit, and the workers come from all over the country with varying experiences and ideological awareness. Some lack the sense of being masters of the country, believing that "only workers who use machines in factories are the working class. Construction workers don't know if they'll be working next year after building this year, so how can they be considered the working class?" and "We hold hammers all day long, hammer never leaves our hands, how can we be masters? Only those who sit in offices are the masters." Some believe, "Anyway, having skills means you can eat anywhere." Some workers from rural areas say it is because "There's nothing to do in winter, so being a worker earns some pocket money, a cotton-padded pair of trousers, and we go home when it's busy with farming." In addition, gang and guild mentalities and regionalism affect unity among workers. Even some foremen secretly control things, so disputes often occur between gangs from the South and the North, Shanxi and Hebei, Wutai and Zuoquan. Some workers are also unwilling to promote advanced experiences. Some workers say, "Flow-line operations will backfire," fearing that they cannot learn the complete set of skills with the new operation method. Older workers believe that "flow-line operations are for young people, and older people can't move around," and some are afraid that "division of labor and cooperation won't show their skills." Trainees also have different understandings of winter training. Many people are ideologically unstable, and some even have concerns. Most young workers come to study culture with full enthusiasm, some say, "Winter training is rest"; while others say, "What winter training, isn't it just to control us."

    In response to the above situation, the department leaders first conducted a general mobilization meeting, explaining the significance of winter training, criticizing various incorrect ideas, and universally launching group discussions. Each brigade established a collective canteen, paid attention to safety and hygiene, and set up cultural and entertainment facilities, resolving some trainees' ideological problems, and the enthusiasm for learning stabilized.

    In carrying out class education, the department adopted a teaching method that combines leadership lectures with mass self-education, and combines large meetings with small meetings, criticizing the rigid teaching method that does not start from the ideological level of the masses, overcoming the tendency at the beginning of talking too much, talking too deeply, and digressing too far, so that the masses "couldn't understand or remember," and enlightening the workers to think about the past and look at the present, gradually understanding that labor creates the world, labor is glorious, and establishing a new labor attitude and the thought of being masters of the country.

    中央第二机械工业部第三工程处在冬季训练中
    进行阶级教育取得初步成绩
    中央第二机械工业部第三工程处有一千三百四十三个工人参加冬季训练工作，自去年十二月八日开始，现在已经结束阶级教育，转入前途教育。
    该处系新建单位，工人来自各地，经历不同，思想觉悟参差不齐，有的还缺乏国家主人翁的思想，认为：“在工厂里使用机器的工人才是工人阶级，建筑工人今年修建明年还不知干不干，算什么工人阶级”，“咱们整天手不离锤，锤不离手，算什么主人翁，只有坐在办公室里的人才是主人翁”。有的认为：“反正是有技术吃遍天下”。有来自农村的工人，则是因为“冬天没事干，当工人赚个零花，赚条棉裤，农忙时还回家”。此外，帮派行会思想、地域观念还影响着工人内部的团结，甚至个别地方还有把头暗中掌握，因此就经常发生南方与北方，山西与河北，五台与左权等帮派的纠纷。部分工人还不愿推广先进经验，有的工人说：“流水作业法会弄巧成拙”，怕新作业法不能学会全套本领。老年工人认为：“流水作业是青年人的事，老年人流动不了”，有的还怕“分工合作显不出自己的本领”。学员对冬训的认识也各不相同，很多人思想不稳定，甚至一部分人思想还有顾虑。青年工人大部分是抱着满腔热情来学习文化，有的说：“冬训是休息”；有的则说：“什么冬训，还不是把咱管起来”。
    根据以上情况，该处领导上首先进行大会动员，说明冬训的意义，批判了各种不正确的思想，普遍展开小组讨论。各个大队都建立了集体食堂，注意安全卫生问题，设置了文化娱乐设备，解决了一些学员的思想问题，学习情绪才稳定下来。
    该处在进行阶级教育中采取领导讲课与群众自我教育相结合、大会与小会相结合的教学方式，批判了不从群众的思想水平出发的死板教学方式，克服了开始时有的讲得太多，讲得太深，扯得太远，以致群众“听不懂记不住”的偏向，启发工人自己想过去看现在，逐步领会到劳动创造世界，劳动光荣，树立新的劳动态度与国家主人翁的思想。
