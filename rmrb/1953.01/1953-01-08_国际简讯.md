    The "New York Times" Praises Colonial Enslavement
    Not long ago, the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalists, published an editorial entitled "Colonialism." It told its readers that in the mid-twentieth century, being a colony was much better than being an independent country. It cited examples, saying, "Countries like Yemen don't need to worry about responsibility at all, because the great powers must shoulder it for them." It also said, "Indonesia is now in a much worse situation than when it was part of the Dutch East Indies, and Libya has found it difficult to support itself and defend itself since independence."
    The intention of this absurd theory of the "New York Times" is very obvious. It would be best for Indonesians and Libyans to ask their old colonial masters to return, or even better, to ask new American colonial masters to re-enslave them. This shows to what extent the "New York Times" fears the surging colonial people's independence movement.
    Large Numbers of American Soldiers Desert
    The American "Kentucky Times" published an article on January 6 stating that there are currently 25,000 to 30,000 deserters in the American army. To deny the above statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Army announced on the same day: "The total number of American deserters is about 5,000." However, the spokesperson added that this average figure does not include those who deserted and were caught and returned to the army. Then, the spokesperson added: "Currently, about 6,000 soldiers have left their posts without leave, but they have not yet been classified as deserters."
    The American people have begun to use action to show that they are unwilling to sell their lives for the profits of Wall Street.

    “纽约时报”歌颂殖民奴役
    不久以前，美国垄断资本家的喉舌“纽约时报”发表了一篇题为“殖民主义”的社论，它向它的读者说，身处二十世纪中叶，作殖民地比作独立国要好得多。它举例子说，“像也门这样的国家一点也用不着忧愁什么责任问题，因为大国必须替它一手担承”。它还说，“印度尼西亚现在就比它是荷印帝国一部分时的情况要坏得多，而利比亚独立以来竟难以支持自己防御自己”。
    “纽约时报”这种妙论的用意是很显然的，印度尼西亚人和利比亚人最好还去请旧殖民主子回去，更好的是请新的美国殖民主子去，重新奴役他们。这使人想到：“纽约时报”对于澎湃高涨的殖民地人民独立运动是惧怕到什么程度。
    美军士兵大批逃亡
    美国“肯塔基时报”一月六日发表了一篇文章，说美国现有逃兵两万五千到三万人。美国陆军部发言人为了否认上述说法，在同日宣布说：“美军逃兵总共约有五千人。”可是，这位发言人补充说，这个平均数字不包括那些逃走而已被抓回军队的人在内；接着，这个发言人又补充说：“目前约有六千名士兵未经请假擅自离职，但是还没有把他们列为逃兵。”
    美国人民已开始用行动表示他们不愿为华尔街的利润而卖命了。
