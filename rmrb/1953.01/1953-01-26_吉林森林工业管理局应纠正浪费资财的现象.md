    Jilin Forestry Administration Bureau Should Correct the Phenomenon of Wasteful Spending
    Editor: The materials supply department of the Jilin Forestry Administration Bureau should overcome the phenomenon of wasting state resources. In the past, the bureau blindly purchased materials without design or planning, resulting in a backlog of materials, wasting more than 7 billion RMB from 1949 to 1951. The telephones that the bureau installed were completely unusable. There were also significant losses in material storage. More than 40,000 jin of corn were lost during storage. In addition, the bureau transported more than 72,000 red bricks and more than 250 tons of coal to the Dafengman area without proper design, but the Dafengman Water Transportation Office did not use these materials after they arrived. To this day, this batch of coal and red bricks is still left there. The transportation cost of returning them would be significant.
    The thinking of the materials management personnel of the bureau is very confused. Some say: "Forestry work is good, but materials work is not, because the leaders do not pay attention to it." Others say: "Materials work is for 'bean cake cadres'. If the production tasks are not completed, the blame is put on those who manage the materials."
    Therefore, I hope that the leading cadres of the Jilin Forestry Administration Bureau will go deep into the workshops, grasp the material consumption quotas, and make accurate plans. Eliminate this waste phenomenon to welcome the large-scale economic construction of 1953.

### 吉林森林工业管理局应纠正浪费资财的现象

    吉林森林工业管理局应纠正浪费资财的现象
    编辑同志：吉林森林工业管理局材料供应部门，应克服浪费国家资材的现象。过去该局没有设计和计划，就盲目地采购材料，因而积压很多材料，自
    一九四九年到一九五一年计浪费人民币七十多亿元。该局安好了的电话机，根本不能使用。在材料保管方面，也有很大损失。在保管苞米时，就损失了四万多斤。另外该局没有很好设计，就向大丰满地区运送七万二千多块红砖和二百五十多吨煤炭，这些材料运到之后，大丰满水运处却不用了。到现在，这批煤炭和红砖还扔在那里，若再运回来，所花的运费是很大的。
    该局管材料的人员思想很混乱。有的说：“做森林工作很好，但做材料工作不好，因为领导不重视。”有的说：“作材料工作是豆饼干部。完不成生产任务，都埋怨管材料的。”
    因此，我希望吉林森林工业管理局领导干部，深入车间，掌握材料消耗定额，作出准确计划。消除这种浪费现象，以迎接一九五三年大规模经济建设。   赵峻峰
