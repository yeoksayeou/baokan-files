Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Publication Administration's Response to Unified Font

    Editor's Note: This newspaper has received letters from readers such as Zhao Zuke, proposing suggestions for organizing and unifying fonts. Now, the Central People's Government Publication Administration has responded to this suggestion. Because many readers are concerned about this matter, it is published publicly below:
    Indeed, there are quite a few variations of single characters in our Chinese writing, both in printing and handwriting. For example, "羣" and "群" are two forms of the same character, and "畧" and "略" are two forms of the same character. They have different ways of writing, but are actually the same character. For people who are learning to read, after recognizing one, they have to recognize another, which is not only troublesome but also completely unnecessary. In the future, the nationwide campaign to eliminate illiteracy will be launched. If it can be organized in advance to achieve one character, one form, it will still be of great help to promote the elimination of illiteracy. In addition, in terms of publishing, achieving one character, one form will also bring many conveniences to typesetting and proofreading. Therefore, Comrade Zhao Zuke's suggestion on organizing and unifying fonts is completely correct. The Printing Administration Bureau of our administration and the People's Education Press and other units are now conducting inspections to prepare for research. However, there are many characters with multiple forms, and it will take a considerable amount of time to check, research, and organize them one by one. It is impossible to make a decision quickly.

    出版总署对统一字体的答复
    编者按：本报曾先后收到读者赵祖科等的来信，提出了整理与统一字体的建议。现在中央人民政府出版总署对这一建议已经有了答复。因为关心这件事的读者很多，特公开发表于后：我国文字在印刷上与书写上，一字数体的的确不少，如“羣”“群”两体，“畧”“略”两体，写法不同，实是一字。在初学识字的人，认了一个还得另认一个，不但麻烦，而且毫无必要。今后全国扫除文盲工作即将展开，如能事先整理，做到一字一体，对于推进扫除文盲工作仍然有很多帮助。此外，在出版方面，做到了一字一体，排版与校对也都有许多便利。因此，赵祖科等同志关于整理与统一字体的建议是完全正确的。现在已由我署印刷管理局及人民教育出版社等单位在进行检查，作提供研究的准备。不过一字数体的字数很多，逐一加以检查、研究和整理，须经过相当长的时间，不可能很快就作出决定。中央人民政府出版总署
