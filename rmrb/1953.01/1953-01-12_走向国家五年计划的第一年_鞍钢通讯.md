    The First Year Towards the National Five-Year Plan
    ——Ansteel Communication

    The working class of Anshan bid farewell to 1952 with their greatest labor achievements.

    In 1952, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, the workers of Anshan basically completed the capital construction tasks assigned by the state. This task increased eightfold compared to the construction tasks of 1951.

    Last year, Anshan's production units transferred a large number of cadres, technical personnel, and workers to participate in capital construction. However, they still overfulfilled the state production plan and the production increase and conservation plan. Steel production will be 134.4 percent of the 1951 production, and iron production will be 122.7 percent. Local state-owned industries also overfulfilled their production plans.

    Chairman Mao's congratulations on Anshan workers' new fast smelting record were the greatest glory left to the working class of Anshan in 1952. Whether in newspapers, on the radio, or in cordial conversations, people were excited and encouraged, urging each other on. "Strive to produce high-quality steel," this resounding call aroused the greatest response from the working class of Anshan. They said, "With Chairman Mao's leadership, our working class can unleash its creative power." Meng Tai, a special-class labor model, said, "Chairman Mao said in his letter: 'I hope you will continue to work hard and strive to complete the new task of producing high-quality steel in 1953.' I have considered this sentence repeatedly in my heart. I think this new and important task is not only the task of all the employees of the steelmaking plant, but also the task of all the employees of our ironmaking plant, because producing high-quality steel requires high-quality iron." The working class of Anshan responded to Chairman Mao by saying that they will fight heroically to realize the capital construction task that exceeds that of 1951 by more than double, and the steel production task that exceeds that of 1952 by about one-fifth. Both at construction sites and in factories, a work sprint is underway. "Report good news to Chairman Mao with new achievements," this is the cry from the hearts of the workers.

    The festive atmosphere of the New Year further encouraged the workers of various trades at the construction site, and their work seemed more intense than usual. The entire working class of Anshan is stepping into the first year of the national five-year plan with brave and vigorous steps. Zhou Chuandian, a special-class labor model, said, "We must maintain and exceed the production progress of the fourth quarter of 1952 from the first month of the new year, without any slackening, in order to first strive to complete or exceed the production plan for January." This represents the collective will of all the workers in Anshan. The workers of Anshan have put forward the slogan: "Complete the task for the first month according to plan, and never delay!" To this end, the construction units of capital construction have also begun to enter the competition for the first month of 1953.

    Another front marching towards the first year of the national five-year plan is the learning front. Technical worker learning has officially started, and various professional training classes have also begun winter training. This is a guarantee of victory for completing the 1953 capital construction plan. The state's investment in short-term training has reached more than 7.1 billion yuan. Anshan Iron and Steel Company is striving to train about 16,000 more skilled workers. They believe that the planned training of 30,000 skilled workers will be a decisive force in ensuring the completion of capital construction tasks. The working class of Anshan overcomes cultural and technical difficulties with the same selfless spirit as production, preparing their strength for large-scale construction this year.

    The start of the national five-year plan has given the workers of Anshan great encouragement.

    At this historically significant moment, the topic of conversation among workers easily turns to yearning for the lives of Soviet workers. They say, "After participating in a year of large-scale construction, the lives of Soviet workers are no longer a dream for the Chinese working class. Although we are building from scratch, our lives are starting to get closer and closer to theirs." Now, workers buy leather shoes and clothing materials from Shanghai for their wives during the New Year. Wasn't this a dream in the past? But now it is an undeniable reality.

    Yes, every new life achievement, no matter how small, can be exciting and trigger a greater production upsurge, and this is often not easily understood by ordinary people. For example, many photos of Anshan's capital construction have been published in newspapers across the country. These are very important and inspiring photos. However, their biggest shortcoming is forgetting about life, forgetting about the workers' schools, forgetting about the workers' villages and sanatoriums that have been built here, the three-story workers' dormitories with new facilities, the workers' cooperatives... The workers deeply understand the dialectical relationship between production and life. From the changes in their lives, from the consistency between their own interests and the interests of the country, and from the growth of their own strength, they have seen the brilliance and greatness of the Party's call for large-scale economic construction. They raise their hands and cheer for the first five-year plan, because, in the eyes of the workers, the national construction plan is a unified collective action of millions of people under the command of Chairman Mao, is the great will of life, is the great upsurge of production and labor, and is a further approach to the prospect of a happy life.

    走向国家五年计划的第一年
    ——鞍钢通讯
    安岗
    鞍山工人阶级用自己最大的劳动成就送走了一九五二年。
    在一九五二年内，鞍山的工人们在党的领导和苏联专家帮助下，基本上完成了国家交给的基本建设任务。这个任务和一九五一年的建设任务比较起来增加了八倍。
    鞍山的生产单位，去年调出大批干部、技术人员和工人参加基本建设。但是，他们仍然超额地完成了国家生产计划和增产节约计划，钢的生产将为一九五一年生产的百分之一百三十四点四，铁的生产将为百分之一百二十二点七。地方国营工业也全部超额地完成了生产计划。
    毛主席对鞍山工人快速冶炼新纪录的祝贺，这是一九五二年留给鞍山工人阶级最大的光荣。无论在报纸上，在广播中，在亲切的谈话里，人们都兴奋鼓舞，互相勉励着。“为炼好优质钢而奋斗”，这个响亮的号召激起了鞍山工人阶级的最大的回声。他们说：“有了毛主席的领导，我们工人阶级就能够发挥创造力量。”特等劳动模范孟泰说：“毛主席在信中说：‘希望你们继续努力，为完成一九五三年度炼好优质钢的新任务而奋斗。’这句话在我心里反复地考虑了好几次。我想这个新的重大的任务，不仅是炼钢厂全体职工的，也是我们炼铁厂全体职工的任务，因为炼优质钢就必须有优质铁。”鞍山工人阶级回答毛主席的是：要奋不顾身地为实现超出一九五一年一倍以上的基本建设任务和超出一九五二年五分之一左右的钢铁生产任务而英勇斗争。无论在工地，在工厂都在展开着突击的工作。“以新的成就来向毛主席报捷”，这是工人们从心里发出的呼声。
    新年的节日气氛，更加鼓舞了工地各个工种的工人，他们的工作显得比往日更紧张。鞍山全体工人阶级正以勇敢、健壮的步子走上国家五年计划开始的第一年。特等劳动模范周传典说：“我们必须从新年度开始的第一月份，就保持和超过一九五二年第四季度的生产进度，不能有一点儿松懈，以便首先争取完成或超过一月份生产计划。”这是一个代表鞍山全体工人的集体意志。鞍山工人们已提出：“要按计划完成第一个月的任务，决不拖欠！”的口号，为此，基本建设的施工单位也已开始进入一九五三年第一月的竞赛中。
    向着国家五年计划第一年迈进的另一条战线是学习战线，技工学习已经正式开学，各种专业训练班也都开始冬训工作。这是完成一九五三年基本建设计划的胜利保证。国家对于短期训练的投资已达七十一亿余元。鞍山钢铁公司努力争取再训练出一万六千名左右技工，他们认为：有计划地训练出三万名技工，将是保证完成基本建设任务的一个决定性的力量。鞍山工人阶级以进行生产一样的忘我精神来战胜文化的和技术的困难，为今年大规模建设准备自己的力量。
    国家五年计划的开始，给了鞍山工人们极大的鼓舞。
    在这个有历史意义的时辰，工人们谈话的题目很容易转到对苏联工人生活的向往，他们说：“参加了一年大规模的建设工作后，苏联的工人生活对于中国工人阶级再也不是梦想，虽然我们是从头建设起，但是生活是开始越来越近了。”现在，工人们过年给自己的妻子从上海买皮鞋，买衣料，这在过去何尝不是梦想？然而现在却是不折不扣的生活。
    是的，每一个那怕是很小的新的生活成就都可以激动人心，掀起更大的生产热潮，而这一点，一般的人常常是不容易理会的。譬如各地报纸上都登了不少关于鞍山基本建设的照片，这些都是非常重要的鼓舞人心的照片，然而，他们最大的缺陷是忘记了生活，忘记了工人的学校，忘记了这儿建设起来的工人村、工人疗养院，有着新式设备的三层楼房的工人宿舍，工人合作社……。工人们深刻地理解着生产和生活的辩证关系，他们从生活的变化中，从切身利益与国家利益的一致性中，从自己力量的生长中看到了党的大规模经济建设的号召的英明和伟大，他们高举双手欢呼第一个五年计划，因为，国家的建设计划，在工人们的眼中看来，是在毛主席指挥下统一的千百万人民的共同行动，是生活的伟大意志，是生产劳动的极大高涨和更进一步地接近了幸福的生活远景。
