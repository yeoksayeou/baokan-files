    (I) The Tasks of Our Country's Cooperative Workers
    --Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Publication of Lenin's "On Cooperation"
    It has been thirty years since Lenin's work "On Cooperation" was published. In "On Cooperation," Lenin comprehensively elucidated the position and role of the cooperative system in the construction of Soviet socialism, rigorously criticized the erroneous ideas of not valuing or even despising cooperatives, profoundly clarified the most fundamental issues of building socialism, solved the problem of the worker-peasant alliance, clarified the economic purpose of cooperatives, and stipulated the political tasks of cooperatives. This was of great significance for Soviet socialist construction.
    In the great cause of building socialism, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, following Lenin's thought in "On Cooperation," formulated plans for industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and economic and cultural construction. The regulations of the Soviet cooperatives became an important component of the great Stalin Constitution. In the thirty-five years of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, whether during the period of the New Economic Policy, the four Five-Year Plan periods, the Great Patriotic War, or the post-war economic recovery period, the Soviet cooperatives have completed their historical and important tasks. In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, decided by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the transition from socialism to communism, detailed plans were formulated for the cooperative trade, supply and marketing, and consumption cooperatives of collective farms, and huge production, supply, and marketing tasks were stipulated.
    In "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Stalin made the following argument for Lenin's "Cooperative Plan": "The history of our socialist construction proves that this path of development planned by Lenin is completely correct. There is no doubt that for all capitalist countries with a considerable number of small and medium producers, this path of development is the only possible and appropriate path for socialism to achieve victory." Stalin's brilliant argument is obviously suitable for the situation in our country's construction. Chinese cooperative economic workers should strive to study Lenin's "On Cooperation," strive to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet cooperatives, and promote the international significance of this great work of Lenin.
    Our people's great leader Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us that the working class uniting with the peasants to establish a solid worker-peasant alliance is the fundamental problem of the Chinese revolution. China's cooperative movement has developed by leaps and bounds under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. In his 1943 article "On Cooperatives," Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, that is, to think of the masses everywhere, plan for the masses, and put the interests of the masses first."
    In the past three years, Chinese cooperative workers have done a lot of work according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. At present, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives system has more than 36,000 primary cooperatives and more than 120 million members. In 1952, the total retail sales of cooperatives accounted for 10 percent of the total public and private retail sales in the country, while the cooperatives' purchase of agricultural products accounted for 60 to 70 percent of the total state purchases. In addition to supplying daily necessities, cooperatives also supply means of production such as fertilizers and agricultural implements, which has promoted the agricultural bumper harvest movement. Cooperatives purchase cash crops, ensuring the supply of raw materials for state-owned industries. Industrial production cooperatives have organized 250,000 people, and the total output value in 1952 was more than 3 trillion yuan. Cooperatives at all levels across the country have actively participated in the national economic recovery work in the movement to increase production and practice economy and in the establishment of new cooperative trading systems. Cooperatives have achieved great results and gained a lot of experience in promoting the restoration and development of agricultural production, promoting agricultural collectivization, meeting the supply and marketing needs of members, and organizing and educating members. However, there are still many shortcomings in our cooperative work, especially in business management, planning work, economic accounting, and democratic management, which need to be improved and overcome in future work.
    We must correctly recognize that because China is the country with the largest number of small peasant producers, the cooperative economy is very important in national construction; all erroneous ideas that neglect cooperative work should be strictly criticized. Only through cooperatives can we consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, organize the vast number of peasants and small producers, and actively participate in the country's large-scale economic construction. Cooperatives should strive to do a good job in material exchange, and serve the needs of industrial and agricultural construction plans and people's lives. Cooperatives should cooperate with the country's overall construction plan, establish an overall concept; should establish the guiding ideology of the working class, constantly prevent peasants and small producers from taking the capitalist road, and actively try to guide them in the direction of socialism. Lenin said: "The development of cooperatives under the Soviet system is equivalent to the development of socialism." The development of cooperatives in our country during the New Democratic period is to consolidate the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance, to create conditions for socialism, and to enable our country to move smoothly towards socialism.
    The organizational work of cooperatives should be based on the solid foundation of "democratic cooperative building." In the short period of two or three years, the organizational work of cooperatives in our country has made great progress in quantity; however, the composition of members in many primary cooperatives is not pure, and the quality is not high; there are even phenomena of violating democratic principles, apportioning shares, and forcing membership. This kind of bad phenomenon must be thoroughly corrected. According to Lenin's principle of voluntary membership, we must achieve conscious, voluntary, and steady progress; "better fewer, but better"; consolidate and improve step by step. This is the correct guiding principle for the organizational work of cooperatives.
    Improving business management is the key issue related to the improvement and development of cooperative undertakings. Cooperatives should improve business methods, earnestly implement the economic accounting system, shorten the turnover time of funds, and reduce commercial circulation costs. We must strive to learn from the advanced business management methods and economic accounting system experience of Soviet cooperative enterprises. The superiority of our country's cooperatives has not been fully and sufficiently demonstrated, mainly because many cadres still use the method of "running mass organizations" instead of "running business units" to run cooperatives; they have not yet abandoned the supply system mentality and are not good at business management; planning work can only achieve target plans, and the implementation of plans has not yet been implemented to the primary units; the work is not in-depth, the plans are not specific, and they do not understand the needs of the members of the masses, resulting in phenomena such as the separation of production and sales, insufficient sources of goods, imbalance of supply and demand, and excessive accumulation in cooperatives. In the future, cooperatives should actively organize production within the scope of the national plan, expand the sources of goods, and closely combine supply and marketing with production to achieve a balance between production and sales plans. Supply and marketing cooperatives should use the characteristics of locality and mass participation, adapt to local conditions, support local industries, organize processing factories, help industrial production cooperatives, and expand and enrich sources of goods to supplement the deficiencies of large state-owned enterprises. Cooperatives must implement the economic accounting system, correctly grasp prices, achieve open costs, democratic evaluation, and not make excessively low-price supplies, nor make excessively high-price purchases. A one-sided mass viewpoint will make the cooperative business unprofitable or even collapse. It is extremely unfavorable to plan for the long-term interests of the members. Strictly practicing economy, opposing waste, strictly establishing accounting systems, and absolutely abiding by financial discipline are all basic requirements for running cooperatives well, and we must strive to achieve them.
    Training cadres and strengthening theoretical policy and business learning are important conditions for ensuring the healthy development of cooperative undertakings. In "On Cooperation," Lenin required that the standards for cooperative cadres are: cadres who can combine revolutionary courage, revolutionary enthusiasm, with shrewdness and competence, and business skills. Lenin called such cadres "excellent cooperative hands." We must carry out education on socialist prospects among cooperative workers. Cooperatives must serve the current interests of the masses, but also serve the socialist future; otherwise, it is a one-sided mass viewpoint. We must improve the business and cultural level of cadres, and cultivate a large number of "excellent cooperative hands" in the new China in accordance with Lenin's standards.

    （一）我国合作社工作者的任务
    ——纪念列宁论合作制发表三十周年
    列宁著作“论合作制”发表到今天已经三十周年了。列宁在“论合作制”中，全面地阐明了合作制对于建设苏联社会主义的地位和作用，严格地批评了不重视甚至鄙视合作社的错误思想，深刻地阐明了建成社会主义的最根本问题，解决了工农联盟问题，明确了合作社的经济目的，规定了合作社的政治任务。这对于苏联社会主义建设是有重大意义的。
    苏联共产党和苏维埃政府在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，遵循列宁“论合作制”的思想，拟定了工业和农业、城市和乡村、经济和文化建设的计划。苏联合作社的法规成为伟大斯大林宪法的重要组成部分。苏联合作社在三十五年社会主义建设中，不论在新经济政策时期，在四个五年计划时期，在卫国战争和战后经济恢复时期，都完成了它的历史性的重大任务。在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所决定的从社会主义过渡到共产主义的第五个五年计划中，对于集体农庄的合作贸易、供销和消费的合作社、工业生产合作社都制定了详细计划，并规定了巨大的生产、供应和推销的任务。
    斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，对于列宁“合作社计划”作了如下的论证：“我国社会主义建设的历史，证明列宁所策划的这条发展道路是完全正确的。不容置疑，对于一切具有人数相当众多的中小生产者阶级的资本主义国家，这条发展道路是使社会主义获得胜利的唯一可能的和适当的道路。”斯大林英明的论证，显然是适合于我国建设的情况的。中国合作社经济工作者，应该努力学习列宁“论合作制”，努力学习苏联合作社先进经验，发挥列宁这一伟大著作的国际意义。
    我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志经常教导我们：工人阶级团结农民，建立巩固的工农联盟，是中国革命的基本问题。中国合作社运动在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下有飞跃的发展。毛泽东同志在他一九四三年的“论合作社”一文中教导我们说：“合作社性质，就是为群众服务，这就是处处要想到群众，为群众打算，把群众利益放在第一位”。
    三年来中国合作社工作者根据毛泽东同志的指示，作了许多工作。目前全国合作总社系统下，有基层社三万六千多个，社员一亿二千多万人。一九五二年合作社零售总额占全国公私零售总额百分之十，而合作社对农产品的收购则占国家收购总额百分之六十到七十。合作社除供应生活资料外，并供应肥料、农具等生产资料，对农业丰产运动起了推动作用。合作社收购经济作物，保证了国营工业的原料供给。工业生产合作社已组织起二十五万人，一九五二年的生产总值在三万亿元以上。全国各级合作社在增产节约运动中，在建立新的合作贸易系统中，积极参加了国家经济恢复工作。合作社在促进农业生产的恢复和发展、推行农业集体化、满足社员供销需要、组织和教育社员等各方面都获得了很大成绩，取得了不少经验。但是，我们的合作社工作还存在着许多缺点，尤其是在经营管理、计划工作、经济核算、民主管理等方面还存在着许多严重的缺点，有待于今后在工作中努力加以改进，加以克服。
    我们必须正确认识：由于中国是农民小生产者最多的国家，合作社经济在国家建设中，是非常重要的；一切忽视合作社工作的错误思想，都应该受到严格批判。只有通过合作社，我们才能巩固工农联盟，把广大农民和小生产者组织起来，积极参加国家大规模的经济建设。合作社应该努力作好物资交流工作，为工农业的建设计划和人民生活需要服务。合作社应该配合国家整个建设计划，树立整体观念；应该树立工人阶级领导思想，时时刻刻防止农民小生产者走资本主义道路，并积极设法引导他们向社会主义方向前进。列宁说：“合作社在苏维埃制度下的发展，就等于社会主义的发展。”我国合作社在新民主主义时期的发展，就是巩固工农联盟的基础，就是创造社会主义的条件，使我国顺利地向社会主义前进。
    合作社的组织工作，应该建立在“民主建社”的巩固基础之上。我国合作社组织在两三年的短时期间，在数量上发展的成绩很大；但不少基层社社员成分不纯，质量不高；甚至有违反民主原则，摊派股金，强迫入社的现象发生。这种恶劣现象，必须彻底改正。根据列宁指示的自愿入社原则，我们必须做到自觉自愿稳步前进；“宁肯少些，但要好些”；巩固起来，提高一步。这是合作社组织工作的正确方针。
    改进业务经营管理，是关系着合作事业提高和发展的关键问题。合作社应该改善经营方法，切实地实行经济核算制，缩短资金周转时间，减少商业流转费用。苏联合作社企业的先进的经营管理方法和经济核算制的经验，我们必须努力学习。我国合作社的优越性，还没有完全和充分表现出来，主要原因就在：许多干部还是用“办群众团体”的作法，不是用“办企业单位”的方式来办合作社；他们还没有丢掉供给制思想，不善于经营管理；计划工作还只能做到指标计划，执行计划还未贯彻到基层单位去；工作不深入，计划不具体，不了解社员群众的需要，以致在合作社中发生产销脱节、货源不旺、供求失调、积压太多的现象。今后合作社应在国家计划之内积极组织生产，扩大货源，使供销与生产密切结合起来，达到产销计划平衡。供销合作社应利用地方性和群众性的特点，因地制宜，支持地方工业，组织加工工厂，帮助工业生产合作社，扩大和充实商品来源，以补国营大企业生产之不足。合作社必须实行经济核算制，正确掌握物价，做到公开成本，民主评价，不作过低价的供应，也不作过高价的收购。片面的群众观点，将使合作社经营无利，甚至亏损垮台。为社员长远利益打算，这是极为不利的。厉行节约，反对浪费，严格建立会计制度，绝对遵守财政纪律，这些都是办好合作社的基本要求，我们必须力求其实现。
    培养干部，加强理论政策和业务学习，是保证合作社事业健康发展的重要条件。列宁在“论合作制”中，要求合作社干部的标准是：能够把革命胆略、革命热忱与精明强干、精通业务的商人本领结合起来的干部。列宁称这样的干部为“优良的合作社手”。我们必须在合作社工作者中开展社会主义前途的教育。合作社既要为群众目前利益服务，又要为社会主义前途服务；否则就是片面的群众观点。我们必须提高干部的业务和文化水平，依照列宁的标准，培养出新中国的大批的“优良的合作社手”。
