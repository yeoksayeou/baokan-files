In the Soviet Union, when designing, constructing, or renovating cities, large residential areas, industrial enterprises, schools, government offices, medical and health facilities, childcare facilities, water conservancy projects, water sources, and public places, the construction can only proceed after being reviewed and approved by the local national health supervision authorities. The purpose is to ensure that all basic construction projects meet hygiene requirements, protect people's health, and avoid waste after completion. Therefore, in the Soviet Union's planned economic construction, all basic construction projects fully meet hygiene requirements, allowing the Soviet people to work happily and live a fulfilling and happy life.

Regardless of the building being designed, attention must be paid to hygiene standards. For example, many people live in residential areas, and if hygiene standards are not observed, many problems will arise. If feces, garbage, sewage, soot, etc., are not properly treated, they will pollute the air, soil, and water sources, which will greatly increase the incidence of disease. However, many of our units often neglect the hygiene standards of projects during the design stage, resulting in many losses. For example, a factory in Fushun built a three-story dormitory next to the factory building, but due to the impact of the smoke emitted by the factory, it now has to be used as a warehouse.

Of course, it is not to say that dormitories should not be built next to factories, but that when building dormitories, there should be a certain distance from the factory to avoid being affected by the smoke, toxic gases, sewage, noise, and vibration emitted by the factory.

In Benxi, there are even plans to build a large livestock pen, with an attached slaughterhouse, upstream of the water source for the Gongyuan mining area and the cement plant. Obviously, this will directly pollute the water source and affect the health of the citizens. There are many similar examples. In order to change this situation and facilitate our work better, we must formulate various practical and scientific hygiene standards. Today, the materials we mainly rely on for formulating hygiene standards are the Soviet Union's hygiene standards. Because the Soviet Union's hygiene standards have a strict scientific basis, and more than 30 years of Soviet experience have proven that their hygiene standards are the most practical, widely applicable, and most in line with the principle of thrift. We referred to the Soviet Union's factory design hygiene standards and, based on the specific conditions in Northeast China and the needs of large-scale economic construction in the future, initially formulated the "Provisional Hygiene Standards for Factory Design in the Northeast Region," which was approved for trial implementation by the Northeast People's Government on September 18, 1952. We have also drafted the "Draft Provisional Hygiene Standards for the Design of Workers' Residential Areas in the Northeast Region," the "Draft Provisional Hygiene Standards for the Design of Urban Primary and Secondary Schools in the Northeast Region," and the "Draft Provisional Hygiene Standards for the Design of Public Canteens in the Northeast Region," based on Soviet materials, and are currently seeking opinions from all parties. In formulating these standards, our main data is based on the Soviet Union, and we refer to the actual situation in Northeast China, deleting content that is not applicable to China, appropriately lowering standards that are too high, and making appropriate supplements to materials that are insufficient.

When we first started formulating hygiene standards, we had great concerns, fearing that the standards were too high and not suitable for China's current situation, making it impossible to implement them. However, the results of practice completely shattered our concerns. Because the Soviet Union's hygiene standards are the most reasonable standards. For example, when some design engineers designed hospitals, the construction area per bed was 48 square meters, and each bed in the ward only occupied 2.5 to 3 square meters. In the Soviet Union, it is stipulated that each bed in the ward should occupy 6 square meters, but the actual construction area only needs 40 square meters per bed. Undoubtedly, the hospital designed by our engineers, as mentioned above, has a lot of waste.

Although the Soviet Union's design hygiene standards are very scientific and reasonable, some ideological obstacles were still encountered in the process of implementation. For example, when building dormitories, because there were very few employee dormitories left by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and many workers still live in dilapidated houses, some do not have their own houses and have to live with relatives and friends, and new workers are increasing every day, they all need houses to live in, so some people disagree with building according to hygiene standards. They say, "What hygiene or no hygiene, having a house to live in is better than not having a house to live in." This statement is inappropriate. In the past, the imperialist reactionaries did not care about the lives and health of the working people, but in our country where the people are in charge, we must pay attention to this point. When building employee dormitories, they must meet hygiene standards, but they can be used flexibly according to different situations. For example, a room that is supposed to accommodate four people according to the standard can now accommodate six people. Once the economic situation improves, we can fully use it according to the standard, so as to avoid reconstruction and renovation in the future, which would waste engineering. This approach meets the current practical needs and takes into account the needs of future development.

Another issue is "Comprehensive Design, Phased Construction." This means that when constructing some buildings, a general layout must be made at the time of design, which has many benefits. For example, when designing a workers' village, a comprehensive layout must be arranged: where to build dormitories, where to build a school with a capacity of how many people, where to build a kindergarten, etc. If public buildings such as schools, nurseries, clubs, bathrooms, and cooperatives cannot be built at the same time, locations should be reserved in the general plan to prepare for gradual addition in the future. If locations are not reserved in advance, when these buildings need to be built in the future, there will be no land, which will affect the development of residents' cultural life. Even if there is land, whether the future design conforms to the overall configuration and hygiene requirements of various buildings is also questionable.

Currently, we do not have a complete set of various hygiene standards, and we cannot more comprehensively put all basic construction projects under hygienic supervision, so that all buildings can meet hygienic requirements to ensure people's happy and healthy lives. Therefore, the formulation of various hygiene standards is our current urgent task. Before they are formulated, we should first extensively introduce and refer to the Soviet Union's hygiene standards.

    设计中必须注意卫生标准
    原东北人民政府卫生部国家卫生监督室　赵干
    在苏联，当设计、建筑或改修城市、大型居民区、工业企业、学校、机关、医疗卫生设施、保育设施、水利工程、水源地及公共场所时，必须经过当地国家卫生监督机关的审查批准，方得施工。其目的是为了保证各项基本建设工程合乎卫生要求，以保护人民的身体健康，避免竣工后的浪费现象。因此，在苏联的计划性经济建设中，各项基本建设完全合乎卫生要求，使苏联人民得以愉快地劳动和过着美满幸福的生活。
    无论设计任何建筑物，一定要注意卫生标准。譬如居民区住了很多人，如不注意卫生标准，便会发生很多问题。如粪便、垃圾、污水、煤烟等不很好地处理，就会污染空气、土壤和水源，就会使发病率大大提高。但是，目前我们有不少单位在设计时，常常忽略工程的卫生标准，因而造成了许多损失。例如抚顺某工厂在厂房旁边修了一座三层楼的宿舍，由于受工厂冒出的煤烟影响，现在只好改作仓库。
    当然并不是说在工厂旁边不应当修宿舍，而是说修宿舍时，应和工厂有一定的距离，以免受工厂中所冒出的煤烟、毒气、污水、骚音、震动的影响。
    在本溪，甚至准备在工源区采屯和水泥厂水源附近的上游建筑一个大型畜圈，并附设屠宰场。显然这将直接污染水源，影响市民的健康。类似这样的例子是很多的。为了改变这种情况，便利我们更好地进行工作，必须制定各种切合实际的科学的卫生标准。我们今天制定卫生标准，主要依靠的材料是苏联的卫生标准。因为苏联的卫生标准有严格的科学基础，苏联三十多年的经验证明，他们的卫生标准是最切合实际需要和能够广泛应用的，也是最符合节约原则的。我们参照了苏联的工厂设计卫生标准，根据东北的具体情况和今后大规模经济建设的需要，初步制定了东北区工厂设计暂行卫生标准，并经东北人民政府在一九五二年九月十八日批准试行。我们还根据苏联的材料，拟定了“东北区工人住宅区设计暂行卫生标准草案”、“东北区城市中、小学校设计暂行卫生标准草案”和“东北区公共食堂设计暂行卫生标准草案”等，现正在征求各方的意见。我们制定这些标准，主要资料是根据苏联，并参照东北实际情况，将不适用于中国的内容删去，标准较高的适当降低，材料不足的作适当的补充。
    开始制定卫生标准时，我们顾虑很大，怕标准高，不适合中国今天的情况，实行不通。然而实践的结果，完全打破了我们的顾虑。因为苏联的卫生标准，是最合理的标准。例如有的设计工程师在设计医院时，每一床位的修建面积是四十八平方公尺，病室内每个床位只占二·五到三平方公尺。在苏联，规定病室内每床位要占六平方公尺，可是实际修建面积每床位只要四十平方公尺就够了。无疑的，上面所说的我们的工程师设计的医院是有很多浪费的。
    尽管苏联的设计卫生标准十分科学，十分合理，但在推行中间仍遇到了一些思想障碍。譬如在建设宿舍的时候，由于过去帝国主义和国民党反动派留下来的职工宿舍很少，至今还有很多工人住在破烂的房子里，有的自己没有房子，只好借住在亲戚朋友家，新的工人又一天天增多，他们都需要房子住，因此有些人便不同意按照卫生标准修建。他们这样讲：“什么卫生不卫生，有房子住总比没房子住强。”这种说法是不妥当的。过去帝国主义反动派不关心劳动人民的生活和健康，但在我们人民自己做主的国家里，一定要注意到这一点，在建筑职工宿舍时一定要合乎卫生标准，但在使用时可以根据不同情况灵活运用。比如按标准住四个人的房间，现在也可以住六个人，一旦经济情况好转，我们便可以完全按标准使用，俾可免得将来重修和改修而浪费工程。这样做既符合现在的实际需要，又照顾到将来发展的要求。
    另一个问题是：“全面设计，分期施工。”这就是说，在建筑一些建筑物时，在设计当时，一定要作出总平面配置来，这样有很多好处。例如设计工人村时，一定要全面布置好：在那里修宿舍，在那里修一座容多少人的学校，在那里修一座幼儿园等。如果学校、托儿所、俱乐部、浴室、合作社等公共建筑物在目前不能同时修建时，应在总平面上留出位置，准备在将来逐步添设。如果现在不预先留出位置来，将来需要建筑这些建筑物的时候，没有地盘，将会影响居民文化生活的发展。即使有地盘，将来再设计时是否符合各种建筑物总的配置和卫生要求，也是成问题的。
    现在我们还没有一整套的各种卫生标准，不能够更全面地把各项基本建设放在卫生监督之下，而使各种建筑均能合乎卫生要求，以保障人民幸福健康的生活。因此，制定各种卫生标准是我们当前迫切的工作。而在没有制定出来之前，首先应该大量介绍和参考使用苏联的卫生标准。
