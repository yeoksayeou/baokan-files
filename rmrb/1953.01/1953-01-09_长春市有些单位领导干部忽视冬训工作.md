Some winter training classes for construction workers in Changchun City are not very effective because leaders do not pay enough attention to them, and problems are not resolved.

　　Yin Huiyou, the Party Branch Secretary of the Changchun Municipal Civil Engineering and Construction Company, has completely disregarded the winter training work for construction workers. From the beginning of the term on December 6th last year to the end of the year, he neither sent Party cadres nor studied specific problems, and the branch rarely discussed winter training work. The branch office is only six steps away from the winter training office, yet Yin Huiyou wrote a letter to Zhao Jingzhong, a teacher in the winter training class, asking him to report on his work. Zhang Zhirong, manager and Party General Branch Secretary of the Machinery Bureau Engineering Company, did not know the progress and effectiveness of the winter training. When comrades from the Provincial Party Committee working group asked him about the winter training situation, he waved his hand and said: "I don't know, you can ask below, I am busy."

　　Because the leadership does not pay enough attention to the winter training work for construction workers, many problems cannot be resolved, which directly affects the workers' learning. In terms of living conditions, for example, in the winter training class of the Machinery Bureau Engineering Company, the dormitory problem has not been resolved, and most of the management cadres and workers live at home, resting completely after 4:00 PM. Because the dining hall is small and crowded, workers scramble to buy food every day, otherwise they will not get any if they are at the end of the line. When the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions came to inspect the work, the administrator told the cooks: "Today, people from the city are coming to inspect, give the workers more food." The workers were very angry when they heard this. The wages issued to workers by the Changchun Construction Company are generally reduced by one level, and some are even reduced by two levels. Workers generally have complaints about their wages. Technician Liu Guoliang said: "If this problem is not resolved, we will never be able to learn well."

　　In terms of teaching methods, they mechanically copied provisions, regardless of the level of acceptance of the students, and forcibly instilled them, which made the workers uninterested in learning. The chairman of the trade union of the Machinery Bureau Engineering Company started by talking about old China from primitive society and slave society, with stiff sentences and a list of nouns, reading verbatim from the textbook. The workers passed notes under the stage saying: "You can't do it, hurry up and change, you're making us confused." Zhang Xianqiu, the Party Branch Secretary of the winter training class, suggested repeating the lecture, but the leadership thought this would affect the "prestige" of the trade union chairman and decided not to repeat the lecture, regardless of whether the workers understood it or not. The Anda Street training class of Changchun Construction Company started earlier, with a total of more than 1,300 workers gathered. However, due to poor teaching methods and the lack of full-time instructors, the effect was not great. The teachers did not teach according to what the teachers in the Municipal Central Classroom taught, and the workers could not listen to it. Under such circumstances, they even called on the workers to carry out a red flag competition. The workers reflected: "What are we competing for! What can we learn? It's just noisy every day, it's really a living torture."

### 长春市有些单位领导干部忽视冬训工作

    长春市有些单位领导干部忽视冬训工作
    长春市有些建筑工人冬季训练班因为领导不重视，问题得不到解决，教学效果不大。
    该市土木建筑工程公司党支部书记殷会友对建筑工人冬训工作根本不重视，从去年十二月六日开学到年末，既不派党的干部，又不研究具体问题，支部很少讨论冬训工作。支部办公室离冬训办公室只有六步远，殷会友还写信给冬训班教员赵景中，叫他去汇报工作。机械局工程公司经理兼党总支书记张智荣不知道冬训进行的情况和效果，省委工作组同志问他冬训情况时，他竟一摆手说：我不知道，你可以问下面，我忙。
    因为领导方面不重视建筑工人冬季训练工作，所以有很多问题得不到解决，直接影响工人学习。在生活上，如机械局工程公司冬训班由于宿舍问题没有解决，管理干部和工人大部住在家里，下午四时就全部休息。因饭厅小，人多，工人每天抢着买饭吃，不然轮到后面就吃不着。当市工会来检查工作时，管理员告诉炊事员说：“今天市里来人检查，给工人的饭多盛些。”工人听了很气愤。长春建筑公司发给工人的工资普遍降一级，甚至有的降两级，工人普遍对工资有意见。技工刘国良说：“这个问题不解决，多咱也不能学好。”
    教学方法上则是死搬条文，不问学员接受程度，硬往下灌，致使工人对学习不感兴趣。机械局工程公司工会主席讲旧中国从原始社会、奴隶社会开始，词句生硬、名词罗列，照本宣读。工人在台下递条子说：“你不行，赶紧换一换吧，把我们说的稀里糊涂。”冬训班党支部书记张显秋提议再讲，领导方面认为这会影响工会主席“威信”，不管工人听懂没有，决定不重讲了。长春建筑公司安达街训练班开学较早，一共集中了一千三百多名工人，由于教学方法不好，又没有专职辅导员，因而效果不大。教师讲课时也不按市中心课堂教师所讲传授，工人听不进去。就在这样情况下，他们竟号召工人开展红旗竞赛。工人反映：“我们赛个啥！能学个啥？天天就是这样乱吵吵，简真是活受罪。”
