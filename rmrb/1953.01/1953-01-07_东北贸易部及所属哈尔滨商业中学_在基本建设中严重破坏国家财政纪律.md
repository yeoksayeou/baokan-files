Editor's Note: The Northeast Trade Department, without approval, used profits that should have been turned over to the state to build the Harbin Commercial Middle School, and abandoned its responsibility for supervision and inspection. This is a serious violation of national financial discipline, and a profound self-criticism should be made, and the responsibility for this matter should be investigated. Wang Yousheng, the principal of Harbin Commercial Middle School, disregards the law and blatantly engages in wrongdoing, causing huge waste of state funds. The Northeast Trade Department should give him the punishment he deserves. Hu Qingji, the capital construction accountant of the school, was completely correct in adhering to the national accounting system. If he had reported Wang Yousheng's erroneous behavior to the higher-level leading organs or to the newspaper earlier, the state property could have suffered less losses, and he should be commended even more.

The Northeast Trade Department and Affiliated Harbin Commercial Middle School
Seriously Violate National Financial Discipline in Capital Construction

The Northeast Trade Department's affiliated Harbin Commercial Middle School seriously violated national financial discipline in the construction of school buildings, boiler rooms, and affiliated primary school projects, arbitrarily squandering state capital construction funds, unauthorized construction of projects outside the plan, selling and lending capital construction materials, and misappropriating and lending capital construction funds, causing serious losses to state property. The above three projects were funded by the Northeast Trade Department's unauthorized use of profits that should have been turned over in 1951. In 1951, Harbin Commercial Middle School planned to build a new building and a boiler room (including boiler installation), and the planned cost of the two projects was 18 billion yuan. However, the school's proposed budget was 21.5 billion yuan and 8,1386 yuan, which was more than 3.5 billion yuan over budget. The Northeast Trade Department allocated 21.93 billion yuan. In addition, the school also planned to build an affiliated primary school, and the Northeast Trade Department allocated another 4.6 billion yuan. By the end of 1951, Harbin Commercial Middle School had completed 50 percent of the school buildings and boiler rooms, and the foundation of the affiliated primary school had been laid. A total of 13.41 billion and 62 yuan was used, and the remaining 12.1 billion yuan was retained for the continued construction of unfinished projects. At the beginning of 1952, the school stopped building the affiliated primary school, but the remaining funds for the construction of the affiliated primary school were not turned over. In 1952, the Northeast Trade Department continued to allocate funds to the school to build school buildings and boiler rooms, and by the end of October, a total of 1.01689 billion yuan had been allocated. Up to this point, the total amount of allocations was 26.5288 billion yuan.

There was a serious waste of resources in the construction project of Harbin Commercial Middle School. The school's total construction area is 10,573.8 square meters, of which 54 classrooms and 15 laboratories account for 37.43 percent of the total area, and offices, clubs, atriums, corridors, and staircases account for 62.57 percent of the total area. The construction area of ​​atriums, corridors, and staircases is 3,863 square meters, accounting for 36.55 percent of the total construction area, which is almost equal to the construction area of all classrooms and laboratories, which is very unreasonable.

In order to build the school into a so-called "first socialist prototype," the school squandered resources lavishly and built many projects outside the plan: a very beautiful school gate made of granite, a fountain and fish pond in the center of the front yard, a flower greenhouse, and a paved walkway with octagonal concrete bricks covering an area of ​​4,300 square meters in the school's front yard. The school also used capital construction funds to buy one large and one small car, and built a garage. These projects outside the plan have cost more than 880 million yuan.

Harbin Commercial Middle School also misappropriated a portion of the capital construction funds to buy eight pigs and hire a person to feed them (the salary was paid from the capital construction funds) for the purpose of improving the meals. They also bought three rubber-tired carts and eight horses with capital construction funds.

Harbin Commercial Middle School stored a large amount of materials in capital construction. At the end of the 1951 final settlement, the school had a surplus of materials worth more than 8.67 billion yuan. The Capital Construction Department of the Northeast Trade Department had explicitly instructed the school not to arbitrarily use and sell capital construction materials, but the school not only arbitrarily used materials to build projects outside the plan, but also sold materials in large quantities. According to preliminary statistics, the amount of money sold reached more than 3.32 billion yuan. For a period of time, the school became simply a building materials trading market. In August 1952, the school sold 6,065 kilograms of rebar to private merchants, who made millions of yuan in the resale. This matter was discovered by the Harbin Municipal People's Government Capital Construction Committee, which criticized the school and ordered it to make a self-criticism. However, the principal of the school, Wang Yousheng, ignored it.

The school not only sold capital construction materials, but also frequently lent capital construction materials. In 1951, they lent materials worth 42.18 million yuan to the Xiangfang construction site without even keeping a record, and later forgot about it. It was not until November 14, 1952, when the Xiangfang construction site sent someone to return the materials, that they remembered it.

In 1951, the school paid 35.7 million yuan to a private merchant, Xingshunlong, to process 119 tons of white pebbles, but the private merchant failed to deliver the goods on time or return the money, and is still unaccounted for. The school borrowed 69 million yuan of capital construction funds to the Xiangfang construction site five times, and also borrowed more than 84 million yuan to the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education Capital Construction Committee. The Culture and Education Bureau Capital Construction Committee used this money to buy a batch of sofas, but before long, the organization was abolished. It had no money to repay the debt and wanted to use the sofas to offset the debt. The school used a total of 100 tons of coal from January to September 1952, all of which was reimbursed as capital construction fuel expenses. The accountant objected, but the principal said, "I can get it reimbursed at the Trade Department."

The unplanned projects and expenses of the capital construction of Harbin Commercial Middle School were entirely handled under the direction of the school principal Wang Yousheng, who was responsible for leading the school's capital construction work. The Capital Construction Department of the Northeast Trade Department had explicitly instructed that "no projects outside the plan are allowed to be built," but Wang Yousheng said, "I don't listen to that." The school's capital construction accountant Hu Qingji proposed that "no construction can be carried out without a budget and without the approval of higher authorities," but Wang Yousheng said, "I have also made a self-criticism during the Three-Anti campaign and have been criticized. I will still build it." Hu Qingji repeatedly raised objections, but Wang ignored him. Later, Hu Qingji refused to pay, so Wang Yousheng personally signed the expenditure voucher and forced the cashier to pay.

Wang Yousheng did not think that selling capital construction materials without authorization was illegal, but proudly said, "You can't buy them anywhere else in the city, but we still have them here." In November 1952, a joint inspection team from the Northeast Finance Department and the Trade Department inspected the school and formally proposed to Wang Yousheng that "no projects outside the plan are allowed to be built," but after the inspection team left, the school started construction on a large stage outside the plan.

The Northeast Trade Department used the profits that should have been turned over in 1951 without approval to build the Harbin Commercial Middle School, and blindly allocated a large amount of capital construction funds without regard to the actual amount of funds needed and the actual time of use. Although the Capital Construction Department of the department had instructed Harbin Commercial Middle School not to build projects outside the plan and not to arbitrarily use and sell capital construction materials, it did not inspect and deal with the school's repeated violations of these instructions for a long time, which contributed to the school's waste. The Northeast Trade Department decided in 1951 to build an affiliated primary school in Harbin Commercial Middle School. It allocated 4.6 billion yuan to start construction without careful consideration beforehand. The foundation of the primary school had been completely laid, but it was decided not to build the primary school anymore. The remaining funds of 3.5 billion yuan were not recovered, causing the school to accumulate a large amount of funds, which was also wrong.

### 东北贸易部及所属哈尔滨商业中学  在基本建设中严重破坏国家财政纪律

    编者按：东北贸易部未经批准即动用应该上缴而未上缴的利润，修建哈尔滨商业中学，并且放弃了监督和检查的责任，这是严重地破坏国家财政纪律的行为，应作深刻检讨，并应追究这件事情的责任。哈尔滨商业中学校长王又生目无法纪，明目张胆地胡作非为，使国家资金遭受巨大浪费，东北贸易部应该给以应得的处分。该校基本建设会计胡庆积能够坚持执行国家会计制度，这是完全正确的。如果他能及早向上级领导机关或向报社揭发王又生的错误行为，就能使国家财产少受损失，就更应该受到表扬了。
    东北贸易部及所属哈尔滨商业中学
    在基本建设中严重破坏国家财政纪律
    东北贸易部所属哈尔滨商业中学在修建校舍、锅炉房及附设小学三项工程中，严重破坏国家财政纪律，任意挥霍国家基本建设资金，擅自修建计划外的工程，出卖和出借基本建设器材，挪用和出借基本建设资金，使国家财产遭受严重损失。上述三项工程，是东北贸易部擅自动用一九五一年应该上缴而未上缴的利润出资建筑的。哈尔滨商业中学一九五一年计划新建楼房一处、锅炉房一处（包括锅炉安装），两项工程计划需款一百八十亿元，而该校提出的预算是二百一十五亿零八万一千三百八十六元，多预算了三十五亿多。东北贸易部拨给二百一十九亿三千万元。另外该校还拟建筑附设小学一处，东北贸易部又拨给四十六亿元。到一九五一年年终时，哈尔滨商业中学校舍及锅炉房已完成了百分之五十，附设小学已作好基础工程。共用款一百三十四亿一千零六十二万元，余款一百二十一亿多元，留作继续修建未完工程之用。一九五二年初，该校又不修附设小学了，但修建附设小学的剩余款项并未上缴。一九五二年东北贸易部又陆续拨款给该校修建校舍和锅炉房，到十月底止，共拨给十亿一千六百八十九万元。至此，拨款总数共计二百六十五亿二千八百八十万元。
    哈尔滨商业中学的建筑工程存在着严重的浪费现象。该校建筑总面积是一万零五百七十三点八平方公尺，其中五十四个教室和十五个实验室占总面积的百分之三十七点四三，办公室、俱乐部、前庭、走廊、楼梯等占总面积的百分之六十二点五七。前庭、走廊、楼梯的建筑面积共为三千八百六十三平方公尺，占建筑总面积的百分之三十六点五五，和全部教室、实验室的建筑面积几乎相等，这是很不合理的。
    该校为了把学校建筑成所谓“第一社会主义雏型”，大肆铺张浪费，兴修了许多计划外的工程：用花岗石砌成很漂亮的校门，在前院正中修建喷泉和养鱼池，还修了一座花窖，并在学校前院内用八角型的混凝土砖铺成面积达四千三百平方公尺的甬道。该校并用基本建设资金买了大小汽车各一辆，还修了一栋车库。这些计划外的工程，已支出八亿八千余万元。
    哈尔滨商业中学还挪用一部分基本建设资金，买了八口猪，雇一人喂养（工资在基本建设费用中开支），以作改善伙食之用。他们还用基本建设款买了三台胶皮车和八匹马。
    哈尔滨商业中学在基本建设中大量储存材料，一九五一年年终决算时，该校剩余材料价值八十六亿七千余万元。东北贸易部基本建设处曾明文指示该校不准擅自动用和出卖基本建设材料，但该校除擅自动用材料修建计划外的工程以外，并大批出卖材料。据初步统计，其卖钱额达三十三亿二千余万元。该校有一个时期简直成了建筑器材交易市场。一九五二年八月，该校卖了六千零六十五斤铁筋给私商，私商转手之间就赚了几百万元。这件事被哈尔滨市人民政府基本建设委员会发觉了，曾给予批评并责令检讨，该校校长王又生竟置之不理。
    该校不仅出卖基本建设材料，还经常出借基本建设材料。一九五一年他们把价值四千二百一十八万元的材料借给香坊工地，连账也没有记，以后竟忘记了；直到一九五二年十一月十四日香坊工地派人还料，他们才想起来了。
    该校在一九五一年用三千五百七十万元向私商兴顺隆加工小白石子一百一十九吨，但这个私商没有按期交货，也没有还款，直到现在仍无着落。该校曾先后五次把基本建设资金六千九百万元借给香坊工地，又借给哈尔滨市文教局基本建设委员会八千四百多万元。文教局基本建设委员会用这笔钱买了一批沙发，没有好久，这个机构就撤销了。它无钱还账，要将沙发抵账。该校在一九五二年一月至九月共用煤一百吨，全部在基本建设燃料费内报销，会计提出反对意见，校长说：“我可以到贸易部去报销。”
    哈尔滨商业中学基本建设计划外的工程和开支，完全是该校校长王又生指挥办理的，他负责领导该校的基本建设工作。东北贸易部基本建设处曾明文指示“决不准修建计划外的工程”，但王又生竟说：“不听这一套。”该校基本建设会计胡庆积曾提出“无预算，不经上级批准不能施工”，王又生说：“三反我也检讨过，也受过批评，要修还是修。”胡庆积再三提出意见，王仍不理会，后来胡庆积拒绝付款，王又生就亲自签发支出凭证，强令出纳付款。
    王又生不认为擅自出卖基本建设材料是犯法的，反而得意地说：“在全市都买不到的，我们这里还有。”一九五二年十一月，东北财政部和贸易部的联合检查组到该校作了检查，正式向王又生提出“不准修建计划外工程”，而检查组走了以后，该校又在计划之外动工修建大舞台了。
    东北贸易部未经批准就动用一九五一年应上缴而未上缴的利润，去建筑哈尔滨商业中学，又不根据实际需款量及实际用款时间，盲目拨下大批基本建设资金，该部基本建设处虽曾指示哈尔滨商业中学不准修建计划外的工程，不准擅自动用和出卖基本建设材料，但对该校一再违反这些指示的犯法行为，长时间也不去检查处理，这都助长了该校的浪费。东北贸易部于一九五一年决定在哈尔滨商业中学内修建附设小学一处，事前未经周密考虑就拨款四十六亿元动工修建，小学校的基础工程已全部打好，又决定不再修建这个小学，对于剩余资金三十五亿元又不追回，使该校积压大量资金，这也是不对的。
