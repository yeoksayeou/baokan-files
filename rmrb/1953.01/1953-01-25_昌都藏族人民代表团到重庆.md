    Xinhua News Agency report: The Changdu area Tibetan people's National Day observation delegation, a group of twenty-four people led by delegation leader Gesang Wangdui, arrived in Chongqing on the 21st by boat from Wuhan. Over a hundred people went to the dock to welcome them, including Zhou Qin'e, Deputy Secretary-General of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, Sun Yuting, Sangji Yuexi, and Liang Juwu, Deputy Directors of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Committee, and representatives from the Panchen Lama's Chongqing Office in Tibet.
    The Changdu area Tibetan people's National Day observation delegation went to Beijing before last year's National Day and participated in the National Day celebrations in Beijing. On November 9th of last year, they left Beijing and successively visited major cities, factories, schools, hospitals, temples, and scenic spots in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central South China, and also visited the great Huai River harnessing project. During this visit, the representatives personally experienced the great achievements of the motherland's construction in various aspects over the past three years and the infinitely beautiful prospects for all ethnic groups. When talking about his impressions of visiting the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Gesang Wangdui said: "In the past, the people of Inner Mongolia, like our Tibetan people, lived in extreme poverty under the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary forces. After liberation, the people of Inner Mongolia became their own masters, and their economy and culture have developed rapidly in all aspects. Inner Mongolia is a model for our Tibetan people to learn from." Lama Shenba Yuexi said excitedly: "After visiting the Yonghe Temple in Beijing, the Ganzhu Temple in Inner Mongolia, and other temples in various places, we deeply experienced Chairman Mao's ethnic policy and the policy of protecting freedom of religious belief, which is being implemented equally in every place and among every ethnic group in the country."

    昌都藏族人民代表团到重庆
    据新华社讯：昌都地区藏族人民国庆节观礼代表团一行二十四人，在团长格桑旺堆率领下，由武汉乘轮船于二十一日抵重庆。前往码头欢迎的有西南军政委员会副秘书长周钦岳、西南民族事务委员会副主任委员孙雨亭、桑吉悦希、梁聚五和西藏班禅驻重庆办事处代表等一百余人。
    昌都地区藏族人民国庆节观礼代表团于去年国庆节前夕赴北京，在京参加了国庆节盛典。去年十一月九日离京，先后参观了内蒙古自治区、东北、华北、华东、中南等地区的各大城市、工厂、学校、医院、寺院和名胜古迹，并参观了伟大的治淮工程。代表们在这次参观中，亲身体验到祖国三年来各方面建设事业的伟大成就和各族人民无限美好的远景。格桑旺堆谈到参观内蒙古自治区的观感时说：“内蒙古人民过去和我们藏族人民一样，在帝国主义和国民党反动势力压迫下，生活极端贫困。解放后，内蒙古人民自己当家作主人，经济、文化各方面都迅速发展。内蒙古正是我们藏族人民学习的榜样。”沈巴悦希喇嘛兴奋地说：“我们访问了北京的雍和宫、内蒙古的甘珠寺以及其他各地寺院后，深刻地体验了毛主席的民族政策，保护宗教信仰自由的政策，在全国每一个地方、每一个民族中，都是同样地在执行着。”
