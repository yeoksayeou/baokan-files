    Li Seung-man Gangsters Forcibly Conscript Civilians in Seoul Streets as Cannon Fodder
    According to a United Press International dispatch from Seoul on January 13th, the Li Seung-man gangster regime's military police "patrolled the streets of Seoul, seeking and seizing young men of draft age," who were "subsequently taken to training stations."

    This is a concrete portrayal of the Li Seung-man gangster regime executing Eisenhower's plan to "use Asians to fight Asians." One can be certain that the future of these people on the battlefield is either death or desertion.

    李承晚匪帮在汉城大街上抓壮丁当炮灰
    据合众社汉城一月十三日电报道，李承晚匪帮的宪兵在“汉城的大街上巡逻，寻抓达到服役年龄的青年”，“随后被带至练兵站”。
    这是李承晚匪帮执行艾森豪威尔“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划的具体写照。人们可以断定的是：这些人在战场上的前途不是死亡就是逃亡。
