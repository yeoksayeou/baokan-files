    Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, January 5th: According to TASS, the Brazilian newspaper "The People's Paper" published a statement by the Brazilian Committee for the Defense of Peace regarding the recent atrocities committed by American interventionists in the massacre of prisoners of war on Pongam Island. The statement said: The leading body of the Brazilian peace movement believes that it has the glorious responsibility to issue the strongest protest against the massacre carried out by the American commander on Pongam Island on December 14, in which eighty-seven prisoners of war were killed.
    The statement then exposed the deceptive attitude of the American imperialists, who claimed to be the "protectors" of prisoners of war. The statement pointed out: All those who, together with us, demand peace and an end to the Korean War cannot but express their anger at this hypocritical attitude and these bloody means. The purpose of this hypocritical attitude and bloody means is obviously to keep the Korean War going. Our main responsibility is to intensify our efforts to promote common efforts by the people to strive for peace and international understanding... We firmly believe that those who commit crimes in Korea today will surely be punished.

    巴西保卫和平委员会发表声明
    斥责美国杀人犯屠杀战俘罪行
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚五日讯：巴西“人民报”刊载了巴西保卫和平委员会关于美国干涉者最近在蜂岩岛屠杀战俘的暴行的声明。声明说：巴西和平运动领导机构认为：它有光荣的责任对美国司令官十二月十四日在蜂岩岛进行的屠杀提出最强硬的抗议，在那次屠杀中有八十七名战俘被杀。
    声明接着揭露美帝国主义者自命为战俘的“保护人”的骗人的态度。声明指出：所有与我们一起要求和平、要求结束朝鲜战争的人们，对于这种假惺惺的态度和这种血腥手段，都不能不表示愤怒。这种假惺惺的态度和血腥的手段的目的，显然是要使朝鲜战争继续下去。我们的主要责任是加紧努力，促使人民共同来争取和平与国际间的谅解……我们坚决相信，今天在朝鲜犯下罪行的人一定会受到惩办。
