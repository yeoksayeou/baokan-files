    Two Understandings from Studying Soviet Teaching Experience
    Chen Yubo, Assistant Head of the Civil Engineering Department, Harbin Institute of Technology

    The experience of Harbin Institute of Technology over the past two years tells us that learning from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union is not something that can be mastered immediately. For example, when the first group of Soviet advisors arrived at Harbin Institute of Technology two years ago, they brought with them the teaching plans of various departments of Soviet industrial universities. At that time, several university professors from within China happened to be visiting, and we showed them these teaching plans, which they had never seen before. Although some of them verbally expressed admiration, believing that the Soviet teaching plans were indeed good, systematic, clear, and easy to understand, they also revealed a sense of "disdain" in their conversations, feeling that it was just a matter of writing down course names and class hours to make up a number, and there was nothing special about it. At that time, my view was similar to theirs, and for a long time, I did not give the teaching plan the attention it deserved in my work. When formulating the transitional plans for each grade, I did not study it carefully, but subjectively put together thirty-six classes per week. Later, problems occurred repeatedly in teaching. At this time, I still thought it was the teacher's fault and did not further study the impact of the teaching plan on the teaching work. We were teaching according to the Soviet teaching plan, but when our political and foreign language class hours were different from those stipulated by the Soviet Union and the Soviet teaching plan needed to be modified, I truly realized the importance and superiority of the Soviet teaching plan.

    Where does the advantage of the Soviet teaching plan lie? It not only accurately stipulates the class hours of each course and the proportion of lectures, exercises, and experiments, but also strictly stipulates in which semesters this course should be studied and determines the order of priority, which cannot be changed or altered at will. However, we did not have a sufficient understanding of this point. For example, when revising the plan, in order to make up the class hours, we once wanted to adjust several courses, but we tried every possible means, and it still didn't work. (Editor's note: The Harbin Institute of Technology has a five-year academic system, the same as that of Soviet higher education institutions. It carries out teaching according to the five-year teaching plan of Soviet higher education institutions. However, most general higher education institutions in our country have a four-year system. When such higher education institutions adopt the five-year teaching plan of Soviet higher education institutions, they must modify it according to the specific situation.) For example, according to the Soviet teaching plan, physics and theoretical mechanics both start in the second semester of the first year (which is different from our schools within China). If physics is moved forward one semester, then the first half cannot use calculus to explain its formulas and principles, so there is no difference from high school physics. However, if it starts at the same time as theoretical mechanics, there is a great advantage, because in this way, the repetition between the mechanics part of physics and theoretical mechanics can be reduced to a minimum. The Soviet general physics syllabus stipulates that the main content of the first few chapters is only the principle of molecular motion, while other parts about mechanics are discussed very little, and some are even completely deleted.

    The close coordination of the content and order between courses, even the course design plays a certain role. For example, the teaching plan of the industrial and civil construction group stipulates that a single-story factory building design must be done in the second semester of the fourth year. First, the teacher teaching building construction guides students to design the layout, structure, and architectural style of the factory building, and then the teachers teaching heating, ventilation, and water supply and drainage separately guide students to design part or all of the heating, ventilation, and sanitary equipment. In this way, on the one hand, the repetitive parts of the design are avoided, and on the other hand, students develop the concept of overall design and the habit of considering problems from multiple perspectives. Therefore, when formulating the teaching calendar for courses related to this course, we must pay attention to the mutual coordination and connect them closely according to this requirement.

    However, making a plan is not an easy task, and it is ten thousand times more difficult to implement it strictly according to the plan. Based on my experience, to achieve this goal, we should pay attention to the following two points:

    First, teachers must have extremely high professional competence and be able to master the courses they teach. Before class, they must fully prepare the course, study the teaching method, and explain it in the shortest time, so that students can fully understand the content of the course after listening to it once in class. In this way, teachers can fully grasp the time of class and avoid the phenomenon of lectures falling behind the teaching plan. In addition, it is necessary to accurately estimate the required time and the appropriate allocation of time in advance. I have attended the classes of two Soviet experts, and what surprised me was that their estimation of time was accurate to at most one or two minutes. Every time the class bell rang, either they happened to put down the chalk, or they heard them say, "I can finish this section immediately." Naturally, it is not easy to do this. For us, we still need a long period of study.

    Second, close contact must be established between the relevant teaching and research offices. To achieve coordination between courses, teaching and research offices must often contact each other, discuss the division of labor of course content and the coordination of design, and put forward requirements for course progress. In this way, we can teach according to the students' level and progress in a planned way. For example, if the teacher teaching structural design knows that students have just learned the design of a certain special factory workshop when they were taking building construction, then he can also use this workshop as an example in his own lectures, so that students feel that what they have learned is not fragmented and unrelated knowledge, but complete knowledge. The engineers trained in this way, as Professor Kuzmin, a Soviet advisor, said, will not be a person who "sees the trees but not the forest."

    Teaching and research offices should not only understand each other, but also help each other. For example, when the fifth-year students of the Civil Engineering Department did the factory design last year, the industrial construction expert often asked the steel structure expert to jointly guide the design. Each time the invitation was accepted happily, and the students were patiently explained and guided, just like teaching their own courses. This spirit of mutual assistance is also something we must learn.

    Now, let me talk about the issue of combining theory with practice. This is another understanding of mine. The combination of theory and practice is also one of the characteristics of the Soviet higher education system. But in the beginning, our understanding of this issue was not comprehensive enough. In the past, we only regarded production practice and graduation thesis design as the only ways to combine with practice, and ignored the practicality of the content of ordinary courses. For example, when making the internship plan before the graduation thesis design for the fifth-year students, we originally decided to let the students go to the design company for internship, so that they could familiarize themselves with the design specifications stipulated by the government and the commonly used design methods. However, when soliciting the opinions of the Soviet advisors, he asked us in return, what specifications do you use when you teach students to design? This unexpected question stumped us. The Soviet advisor told us very sincerely: The main task of production practice in the Civil Engineering Department is to understand the practical construction methods and construction organizations that cannot be moved to the school, and it is the teacher's responsibility to be familiar with the design specifications and standards actually used. He must be responsible for the practicality of every calculation method and every number he teaches to the students, and must ensure that what students hear in the classroom and what they may encounter in their work after graduation are basically the same thing. If what you learn in school is the strength of American cement and the standard of German steel beams, but what you actually use in the future is Harbin cement and Anshan steel; for example, if you learn the flow formula of the Mississippi River, but you are managing the Huaihe and Yangtze Rivers; then when students start to put into practice after graduation, they will not feel that they are already engineers, but only feel that they are still ignorant students.

    We can also cite a few examples to illustrate this problem. As soon as each Soviet advisor arrived at the school, he asked us for Chinese wind and snow load data, allowable clearance during railway transportation, samples and specifications of Anshan Iron and Steel, hydrological data of major rivers in the country, allowable stress of cement, wood, and steel bars, and meteorological data. And when we provided them with some information, they organized it well and put it into the lectures, trying to avoid using foreign standards and foreign examples. Soviet advisors often told us that an engineer should truly be an engineer of his own country and must give full play to his creativity.

    The above are just my personal two preliminary understandings.

    学习苏联教学经验的两点体会
    哈尔滨工业大学土木建筑系助理系主任　陈雨波
    哈尔滨工业大学两年来的经验告诉我们，学习苏联的先进教学经验，并不是一下就能学好的。举一个例子来说吧，两年前，第一批苏联顾问来到哈尔滨工业大学的时候，曾带来了苏联工业大学各系的教学计划。当时恰好有几位关内的大学教授来这里参观，我们就把这些从来没有见到过的教学计划给他们看。他们中有些人在口头上虽然也表示推崇，认为苏联的教学计划确是好，有系统，清楚明了，使人一目了然。可是在言谈中他们却有意无意地表露了“不屑”的神气，觉得这只是把课程名称和时数写在一起凑个数而已，没什么稀奇。当时，我的看法也和他们差不多，在很长的一段时间内，我在工作中并没有对教学计划加以应有的重视。在制订各年级的过渡计划时，我就没有去好好地研究，只是主观地把每个星期的课凑成三十六堂就算了。后来，在教学中屡次发生问题，这时，我还认为这是教师的过失，没有进一步研究教学计划对于教学工作的影响。我们是按照苏联教学计划进行教学的，但由于我们的政治课和外国语课的钟点数和苏联规定的不同，而需要把苏联的教学计划加以改动的时候，我才真正认识到苏联教学计划的重要性及其优越的地方。
    苏联教学计划的优点表现在那里呢？它不仅确当地规定了每一门课程的时数和讲课、练习、实验等所占的比重，并且也严格地规定了这门课程应该在那几个学期学习，确定了次序的先后，这次序是不能随便更改和变动的。但我们对这一点是认识不足的。例如在修改计划的时候，为了凑时数，我们曾经想调动几门课程，可是想尽了办法，还是不行。（编者按：哈尔滨工业大学的学制是五年制，和苏联高等学校的学制一样。它是按照苏联高等学校五年制的教学计划进行教学的。但是我国的一般高等学校都是四年制。这样的高等学校，在采用苏联高等学校五年制的教学计划时，就必须按照具体情况，加以修改。）又如按苏联的教学计划，物理和理论力学都是在一年级的第二学期开始的（和我们关内的学校不一样），如果要把物理往前挪一学期，那么前面的一半就不能利用微积分来解释它的公式和原理，因而和高中物理就没有什么差别了。但若和理论力学同时开始，就有一个很大的好处，因为这样，可以把物理的力学部分和理论力学的重复处减低到最低限度。苏联普通物理的教学大纲规定，头几章主要的内容只有分子运动原理，而其他关于力学的部分，就讲得很少，有的甚至于全部删掉了。
    各门课程间的内容和次序的紧密配合，甚至于课程设计也是起着一定的作用的。譬如，工业及民用建筑组的教学计划，规定在四年级下学期必须作一个一层厂房设计。首先由教营造学的教师指导同学设计厂房的布置、结构及其建筑型式，然后由教采暖通风和上下水道的教师分别指导学生设计一部分或全部采暖通风和卫生设备。这样，一方面避免了设计的重复部分，另一方面也使学生养成整体设计的观念和多方面考虑问题的习惯。因此，我们在制订和这门课程有关的课程的教学日历时，就必须注意到相互间的配合，按着这种要求把它们紧密地衔接起来。
    可是，订计划不是一件容易的事情，要严格地按照计划去实行更是困难万倍。根据我的经验，要达到这个目的，应该注意下面两点：
    第一，教师必须具有极高的业务水平，能掌握自己所教的课程。课前要充分地准备课程，研究教学法，用最短的时间来讲解，使同学们在堂上听过一遍就能完全了解课程的内容。这样，教师才能充分掌握上课的时间，避免发生讲课落后于教学计划的现象。此外，事先要精密地估计所需的时间，以及时间的适当分配。我听过两位苏联专家的课，使我感到惊奇的是他们对于时间的估计，竟会准确到最多只有一二分钟之差。每次下课铃一响，不是他们正巧放下粉笔，便是听到说“我马上可以结束这一节了”。自然，要做到这一点并不是容易的。对于我们来说，还需要一段长时间的学习。
    第二，各有关教研室之间必须取得紧密联系。要使各门课程间取得配合，各教研室间就必须经常接触，讨论课程内容的分工和设计的配合，彼此提出在课程进度上的要求。这样，我们才可以有计划地根据同学的水平、进度进行教学。譬如教结构设计的教师知道同学们在上营造学的时候刚学过某一种特殊工厂车间的设计，那么他在自己讲课的时候也就可以用这种车间来作例子，使同学们感觉到他们所学的并不是零碎的各不相关的知识，而是完整的知识。这样培养出来的工程师，正像苏联顾问库滋民教授所说的，就不会是一个“只见树木不见森林”的人。
    教研室和教研室之间，不仅要相互了解，还应该互相帮助。譬如，去年土木建筑系五年级的同学做厂房设计的时候，教工业建筑的专家就时常请教钢结构的专家来共同指导设计。被邀请的每一次都愉快地接受这种要求，不厌其烦地对同学进行讲解指导，就像在教自己所担任的课一样。这种互相帮助的精神，也是我们必须学习的。
    现在，我来谈谈理论和实际联系的问题吧。这是我的另一点体会。理论和实际联系也是苏联高等教育制度的特点之一。可是在一开始，我们对于这个问题是了解得不够全面的。过去我们只把生产实习和毕业论文设计看作结合实际的唯一方法，而忽略了平时课程内容的实用性。比如作五年级同学毕业论文设计前的实习计划时，我们原来决定让同学们到设计公司去实习，让他们熟悉一下政府所规定的设计规范和一般常用的设计方法；可是在征求苏联顾问的意见时，他反问我们，你们教同学设计的时候，是用的什么规范呢？这个意外的问题把我们难住了。这位苏联顾问就非常诚恳地告诉我们：土木建筑系生产实习的主要任务，在于了解无法搬到学校里来的实际应用的施工方法和施工组织，而熟悉实际使用的设计规范和标准，则是教师的责任。他必须对他所教给学生的每一种计算方法和每一个数字的实用性负责，必须保证同学在课堂里所听到的和将来毕业以后在工作中所可能碰到的，基本上是一个东西。如果在学校里学的是美国水泥的强度、德国钢梁的标准，而将来实际应用的却是哈尔滨的水泥、鞍山的钢；又譬如学的是密士失比河的流量公式，而治的是淮河、长江；那么学生在毕业以后开始投入实际工作的时候，他就不会感觉到他已经是一个工程师，而只觉到他还是一个一无所知的学生。
    我们还可以举几个例子说明这个问题。每一个苏联顾问一到学校就向我们要中国的风雪荷重资料、铁路运输时容许的净空、鞍钢的样品和规范、全国主要河流的水文资料、水泥木材和钢筋的容许应力、以及气象资料等等。而当我们提供给他们一些资料时，他们都很好地把它们整理出来，放到讲义中去，尽量避免采用外国的标准和外国的例子。苏联顾问常常告诉我们，一个工程师应该真正是自己祖国的工程师，必须发挥自己的创造性。
    上面所提的只是我个人两点初步的体会。
