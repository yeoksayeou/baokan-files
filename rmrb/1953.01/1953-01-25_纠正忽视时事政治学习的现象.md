    Correcting the Phenomenon of Neglecting the Study of Current Affairs and Politics
    Recently, a phenomenon of neglecting the study of current affairs and politics exists among many working cadres and school students. For example, in September of last year, the Propaganda Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a current affairs test for cadres in the city, and the results showed that 75% of the cadres failed. Recent current affairs tests conducted in organs, enterprises, and local work cadres in places such as Dezhou City in Shandong Province, Qidaogou Iron Mine in Tonghua City in Liaodong Province, and Zhaohua County in Sichuan Province, all showed that more than half of the personnel who participated in the tests failed. Some personnel were even unaware of major events such as the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the World People's Peace Congress, and the great victory at Shangganling. Among the more than 300 cadres who participated in the current affairs test in Dezhou City, 80% said they "did not read newspapers." Some people wrote on the test paper: "I don't read newspapers on weekdays, so I can't answer any of the questions." Furthermore, at the enlarged cadre meeting in Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, some cadres expressed indifference to the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, saying, "The front line is not our concern." The patriotic inspection day system in Taigu, Lishi, Linxian, and Jiaocheng counties in Shanxi Province is generally not being implemented, and cadres rarely publicize news from the front line to the masses. Among school students, there is also a serious phenomenon of neglecting the study of current affairs and politics. For example, according to a recent survey, two-thirds of the third-year students in the Mathematics Department of Beijing Normal University did not know what the Shangganling Campaign was about. Some students at Tsinghua University said: "We have forgotten about the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign these days." The wired broadcasts and blackboards in many schools in Beijing have not reported on the Resist America, Aid Korea news for a long time.
    This phenomenon of neglecting the study of current affairs and politics must be quickly corrected. Because a cadre who does not read newspapers and does not pay attention to the study of current affairs and politics cannot correctly understand the current political situation, and cannot correctly understand the working principles and tasks stipulated by the Party and the government, and it is difficult to avoid losing direction in his work and truly do his work well. A cadre who does not pay attention to the study of current affairs and politics himself cannot correctly conduct propaganda and education to the masses he is connected with, thereby guiding the masses to move forward on the correct path. A student who does not regularly engage in the study of current affairs and politics cannot become a future national working cadre with political awareness. This principle is very obvious.
    Why do some of our cadres and students neglect the study of current affairs and politics? There are two main reasons: one reason is that some people, after seeing the great victory of the Korean War and the growing strength of the motherland and the world's peace and democracy camp, have developed a sense of complacency and relaxation. They say, "The Resist America, Aid Korea campaign has been victorious, and the Peace Congress has also been held. There are no more problems. We should bury ourselves in construction," so they have become indifferent to current affairs. Another reason is that some people, after the start of the country's large-scale economic construction work, have developed a "go it alone" mentality in their work. They do not understand that strengthening national construction and strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle are closely related political tasks of the people of the whole country. They say, "We are busy with our work! We don't have time to study current affairs." "Studying current affairs has nothing to do with my work. I can do my work well even if I don't study current affairs." They even think that studying current affairs will delay their work. However, in addition to this, there is an even greater reason, that is, the propaganda departments of party committees at all levels and the heads of various organs and schools have neglected the current affairs and political education of cadres and students. They do not regularly and systematically lead and inspect the study of current affairs and politics among cadres and students, and even they themselves neglect the study of current affairs and politics.
    These comrades should understand that although American imperialism has suffered a heavy defeat, it has not stopped its aggression. Since interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations last October, the American aggressors are attempting to completely tear up all agreements; and have dispatched special agent planes to intrude into our country for strategic reconnaissance, actively carrying out conspiracies to expand the Korean War. On a global scale, the capitalist encirclement of socialist and people's democratic countries still exists, and the imperialist aggression camp headed by the United States is still stepping up preparations for a new world war. Therefore, we must be vigilant at all times, pay close attention to all the conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressors, call on the masses to continue to strengthen the struggle to Resist America, Aid Korea, further strengthen national defense forces, and prepare to smash any new aggression by the American aggressors at any time. Any thought of complacency and relaxation is extremely wrong.
    These comrades should understand that the country's economic construction can only proceed smoothly under the precondition of victory in the Resist America, Aid Korea War and a peaceful international environment. Therefore, regularly studying current affairs and conducting regular current affairs propaganda to the people is a force that enhances the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the people, encourages everyone's work enthusiasm, and promotes the country's construction work. The idea that the study of current affairs and politics has nothing to do with construction work is wrong.
    In order to correct the phenomenon of some cadres and students neglecting the study of current affairs and politics, the leading organs in various places, especially the propaganda departments of party committees at all levels, should strengthen the leadership of cadres' study of current affairs and politics and correct cadres' misunderstandings about the study of current affairs. At the same time, they should help cadres improve their work methods, arrange work and study time, ensure that cadres have a certain amount of time to regularly study current affairs, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of cadres' study of current affairs and politics. Party reporters in organs and schools must earnestly take responsibility for the propaganda of current affairs and politics and regularly report on current affairs and politics to cadres and students. The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted many methods to strengthen the study of current affairs among organ cadres and has achieved good results. The Qianmen District Workers' Union in Beijing has implemented a system for cadres to register their daily newspaper reading. The Propaganda Department of the Baode County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province has also established a system for conducting current affairs tests among cadres throughout the county once a month. These are effective methods for promoting cadres to regularly study current affairs, and various places can imitate and implement them.

    纠正忽视时事政治学习的现象
    近来在许多工作干部和学校学生中，存在忽视时事政治学习的现象。例如中共西安市委宣传部去年九月间对全市干部举行时事测验的结果，竟有百分之七十五的干部成绩不及格。山东德州市、辽东通化市七道沟铁矿、四川昭化县等处最近在机关、企业干部和地方工作干部中举行时事测验的结果，各处参加测验的人员都有半数以上成绩不及格。有的人员连亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议、世界人民和平大会、上甘岭大捷等重大事件也不知道。德州市参加时事测验的三百多干部，有百分之八十说“没有看报纸”。有的人在测验卷上写着：“平日没有看报纸，一条也答不上。”又如，山西省交城县区的扩大干部会议上，有些干部对抗美援朝表示漠不关心的态度，说：“前线不用咱管。”山西省太谷、离石、临县、交城等县爱国检查日制度已普遍不执行，干部很少把前线的消息向群众宣传。在学校的学生中，也有严重忽视时事政治学习的现象。例如据最近调查，北京师范大学数学系三年级学生竟有三分之二不知道上甘岭战役是怎么一回事。清华大学一些学生说：这些时候把抗美援朝忘记了。北京许多学校的有线广播和黑板报已有很久没有报道过抗美援朝的消息。
    这种忽视时事政治学习的现象，是必须迅速纠正的。因为一个不看报纸，不注意时事政治学习的干部，他就不能正确地了解当前政治形势，并正确地体会党和政府所规定的工作方针任务，也就很难在工作中不迷失方向，把工作真正做好。一个自己不注意时事政治学习的干部，他就不可能向他所联系的群众正确地进行宣传教育，从而引导群众在正确的道路上前进。一个学生如果不经常进行时事政治学习，就不能成为有政治觉悟的未来的国家工作干部。这个道理是很明显的。
    我们的干部和学生为什么会有人忽视时事政治学习呢？主要有两个原因：一个原因是，有的人看到了朝鲜战争的伟大胜利，看到了祖国的强大和世界和平民主阵营力量的增长以后，产生了轻敌麻痹的思想。他们说：“抗美援朝胜利了，和平大会也开了，没有什么问题了，应该埋头去搞建设”，因此就对时事漠不关心起来。另一个原因是，有的人在国家大规模的经济建设工作开始后，在工作中又滋长了“单打一”的思想。他们不懂得加强国家建设和加强抗美援朝斗争是互相密切联系着的全国人民当前的政治任务。他们说：“业务忙啊！那有时间搞时事学习。”“时事学习和我的业务没有什么关系，不学时事一样可以做好工作。”他们甚至认为学习时事会耽误自己的业务。可是，除此以外，还有一个更大的原因，就是各级党委宣传部和各机关学校的负责人，忽视了对于干部和学生的时事政治教育，他们不去经常地、有系统地领导和检查干部和学生中的时事政治学习，甚至他们本身也忽视了时事政治学习。
    这些同志应该了解：美帝国主义虽然已经遭受了惨重的失败，但它并没有停止它的侵略行动。美国侵略者自去年十月中断朝鲜停战谈判以来，正企图彻底撕毁一切协议；并派遣了特务飞机侵入我国进行战略侦察，积极进行扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋活动。在全世界范围内，对于社会主义和人民民主国家的资本主义包围仍然存在着，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营仍然在加紧准备着新的世界战争。因此，我们必须时时刻刻提高警惕，密切注意美国侵略者的一切阴谋诡计，号召群众继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，进一步加强国防力量，准备随时粉碎美国侵略者任何新的侵略行动。任何轻敌麻痹的思想，都是极端错误的。
    这些同志应该了解，祖国的经济建设只有在抗美援朝战争胜利，有着一个和平国际环境的前提条件才能顺利进行。因此，经常学习时事，经常向人民群众进行时事宣传，是提高人民群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情，鼓舞大家的工作积极性，推动国家建设工作前进的力量。那种认为时事政治学习和建设工作没有关系的思想，是错误的。
    为了纠正某些干部和学生忽视时事政治学习的现象，各地的领导机关，特别是各级党委的宣传部门应该加强对干部的时事政治学习的领导，纠正干部对时事学习的错误认识。同时要帮助干部改进工作方法，安排好工作和学习的时间，保证干部能有一定的时间经常进行时事学习，并加强对干部时事政治学习的督促和检查。机关和学校中党的报告员要切实负起时事政治宣传的责任，定期向干部和学生作时事政治的报告。中共北京市委宣传部已采取许多办法，加强机关干部的时事学习。并已获得良好成绩。北京市前门区区工会实行了干部每日读报登记的制度。中共山西保德县委宣传部在全县干部中也建立了每月举行时事测验一次的制度，这些都是推动干部经常地进行时事学习的有效办法，各地可以仿效实行。
