Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 22nd: According to TASS, after the US judicial authorities determined that thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party had violated the fascist Smith Act, they rejected requests for bail and threw them into prison. Elizabeth Flynn, Claudia Jones, and Berti Ganett were taken to women's prisons; Pettis Perry, Alexander Bittelman, Jacob Mindel, George Blake Charney, Volkov Vanston, Albert Francis Lannon, Arnold Johnson, Louis Winestock, Alexander Trachtenberg, and Victor Jerome were handcuffed together and transferred to a special federal male offender detention center.

    The "Citizens Emergency Defense Committee," responsible for rescuing the Communist leaders, issued a statement to the press denouncing the jury's unreasonable verdict (the verdict that the Communist leaders were guilty of violating the Smith Act - editor's note), saying: "This verdict threatens the democratic rights of 160 million American people and further undermines the Bill of Rights. The jury's lengthy deliberations do not change the fact that this pre-arranged verdict is part of all Smith Act slanders and all thought-control trials. It is based on perjury bought by a corrupt Justice Department. This is a verdict made by a jury swayed by prejudice and intimidation... These thirteen men and women are convicted solely because their political views - writings and speeches - happen to be communist...."

    美国“公民紧急保卫委员会”发表声明斥责美政府无理迫害十三名美共领袖
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：美国司法当局在判定美国共产党十三名领袖违反法西斯的史密斯法以后，拒绝了保释的请求并把他们投入监狱。伊丽沙白·弗林、克罗迪亚·琼斯、和伯蒂·甘内特被带进女监；佩蒂斯·佩里、亚历山大·毕特尔曼、雅各布·明德尔、乔治·布莱克·查尼、沃可夫·万斯东、艾伯特·弗朗西斯·兰农、阿诺德·约翰逊、路易·温斯托克、亚历山大·特拉腾堡和维克托·季洛姆被用手铐锁在一起移送到一个联邦男犯特别拘留所。
    负责营救共产党领袖的“公民紧急保卫委员会”向报界发表声明，斥责陪审团的无理裁决（决定共产党领袖犯有违反史密斯法的裁决——编者）说：“这一裁决威胁到一亿六千万美国人民的民主权利，并进一步破坏了民权法案。陪审团的长时间讨论并没有改变这个事实，就是：这种预先安排好的裁决是所有史密斯法诬告、所有思想管制审讯的一部分。它所根据的是贪污腐败的司法部所收买的伪证。这是一个为偏见和恫吓所左右的陪审团所作的裁决……这十三个男女之所以被定罪仅仅是因为他们的政治见解——著作和言论——恰好是共产主义的……。”
