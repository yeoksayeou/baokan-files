The Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government of Sichuan Province is a people's regime equivalent to a special zone. The autonomous region governs six counties, including Songpan, Li County, Maoxian County, Maogong, Jinghua, and Wenchuan, with a population of more than 500,000, of which the Tibetan people account for about 75%.

Xinhua News Agency, Labrang, 7th: The Friendship Association of All Ethnic Groups and Circles in the Tibetan Area of Southern Gansu opened in Labrang on December 25th last year and successfully concluded on January 3rd this year after ten days. The meeting decided to establish a preparatory committee for the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region. The Gannan Tibetan area includes the Zhuoni Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xiahe County where Tibetans live, Lintan County where Tibetans, Huis and Hans live together, and part of the Tibetan-populated areas originally belonging to Minxian, Xigu, and Wudu counties. More than 280 representatives from all ethnic groups and circles in the above areas attended the meeting. At the meeting, all the representatives discussed the issue of implementing national regional autonomy. After full consultation, Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan) was elected as the Director of the Preparatory Committee, Yang Fuxing (Tibetan), Huang Xiang (Tibetan), and Zhu Xiafu as Deputy Directors, and Duolahai (Tibetan), Ma Fuchun (Hui) and 44 others as preparatory committee members.

The Gannan Tibetan area is a region with a total population of about 200,000 people of Tibetan, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups. Except for a few semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, most of the area is a nomadic area where Tibetans live. Among them, the Tibetan-populated areas in Zhuoni and Minxian, Xigu, Wudu and other places have already implemented national regional autonomy under the leadership of the higher-level people's governments after liberation, exercising their autonomous rights and managing the affairs within the autonomous region. Now, the unity among the various ethnic groups and tribes in the Gannan Tibetan area is increasing. Twenty-two places equivalent to districts and one hundred and five places equivalent to townships have established district and township-level people's governments, more than 400 minority cadres have been trained, and economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings have also developed.
