Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 20th: The Northeast region is vigorously carrying out preparatory work to welcome a large-scale movement to implement the Marriage Law.

The Northeast Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee convened a meeting of the principal responsible persons of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees of each province and city from the 14th to the 16th of this month. The meeting discussed how to carry out the Marriage Law implementation movement throughout the region. Li Zhuoran, Director of the Northeast Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, made a concluding speech at the meeting. Li Zhuoran pointed out in his report: It is wrong for some cadres to isolate the current central task of economic construction and thus neglect the implementation of the Marriage Law. Experience has proven that in rural areas where the Marriage Law is better implemented, the agricultural cooperative movement is also better. When the broad masses of working people have a democratic and harmonious family life, they can better exert their enthusiasm for participating in national construction. Li Zhuoran said that the key to implementing the Marriage Law lies in the thorough understanding and implementation of the Marriage Law by the vast number of cadres, and in carrying out extensive, in-depth, vivid, and specific publicity and education work among the masses. He demanded that all localities adhere to the principle of education in this movement, so that the vast number of cadres and the people can ideologically distinguish between the feudal marriage system and the new democratic marriage system, recognize that free marriage is correct and legal, while arranged and mercenary marriages and abuse of women are illegal, backward, and shameful, thereby creating public opinion that is completely conducive to freedom of marriage and creating favorable conditions for further implementation of the Marriage Law in the future. Li Zhuoran finally requested that the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees and offices of all provinces and cities immediately establish regular work, and quickly organize forces (including training cadres and organizing the study of office cadres), strengthen the leadership of pilot work, summarize experience in a timely manner, immediately formulate and review materials for publicity to the masses, and convene meetings of people's representatives from all walks of life and meetings of reporters and propagandists to discuss how to carry out the publicity work for the Marriage Law implementation movement.

The Northeast Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee has transferred more than 40 capable cadres from various departments to form a pilot work group, which will be concentrated for training and then sent to various places to inspect the pilot work. The Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees of various provinces and cities have also begun pilot work and formulated plans for training village cadres. The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation has also decided to open two training classes in the near future to transfer women cadres from various places for centralized training. The first training class has already begun.

    东北大力进行贯彻婚姻法运动准备工作
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北区为迎接大规模贯彻婚姻法的运动，正大力进行准备工作。
    东北贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在本月十四日至十六日召集各省、市贯彻婚姻法运动委员会主要负责人举行会议，会议讨论了如何在全区开展贯彻婚姻法运动的问题。东北贯彻婚姻法运动委员会主任李卓然在会议上作了总结发言。李卓然在报告中指出：有些干部把当前经济建设这个中心任务孤立起来看待，因而忽视贯彻婚姻法是不对的。经验证明：在婚姻法贯彻比较好的农村，农业合作互助运动也比较好，广大劳动人民有了民主和睦的家庭生活，就能更好地发挥参加国家建设的积极性。李卓然说，贯彻婚姻法的关键在于广大干部对婚姻法的透彻了解与贯彻执行；在于向群众进行广泛、深入、生动、具体的宣传教育工作。他要求各地在这次运动中，要坚持教育的方针，要使广大干部和人民群众在思想上划清封建婚姻制度与新民主主义婚姻制度的界限，认识自由婚姻是正确的，合法的；而包办买卖婚姻和虐待妇女则是非法的，落后的，可耻的，从而造成完全有利于婚姻自由的舆论，为今后进一步贯彻婚姻法创造良好的条件。李卓然最后要求各省市的贯彻婚姻法运动委员会及办公室，立即建立起经常工作，并迅速组织力量（包括训练干部、组织机关干部学习等），加强对试点工作的领导，及时总结经验，立即制定和审定向群众宣传的材料，召开各界人民代表会议及报告员、宣传员的会议，商讨如何开展贯彻婚姻法运动的宣传工作。
    东北贯彻婚姻法运动委员会已自各部门抽调四十多名得力干部组成试点工作组，集中训练后即分赴各地检查试点工作。各省、市贯彻婚姻法运动委员会也开始进行试点工作，并制订出训练村干部的计划。东北民主妇女联合会还决定在最近开办两期训练班，抽调各地妇女干部集中训练，第一期训练班已开始。
