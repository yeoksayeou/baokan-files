The construction of China's first heavy machinery plant in Taiyuan is one of the large-scale enterprises of decisive significance for China's industrialization. The successful experience of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant in the past two and a half years, or the lessons learned from detours, are of the most practical significance for both leading cadres and the vast number of employees, and for the arduous task of building new large-scale enterprises in our country.

Three years ago, at the first National Machine Industry Conference, people still regarded the construction of such a heavy machinery plant as a beautiful ideal. However, with the end of the period of economic recovery in the motherland, we have now seen this ideal gradually becoming a reality. The main workshops of the plant will soon be completed one after another, and the employees have the confidence and conditions to strive to complete the project, originally planned to be completed in five years, in four years ahead of schedule. Under the correct policy of "building and putting into production simultaneously," this plant is now in a position to process large equipment parts for other brother factories and mines in the country. The successful completion of the thin plate machine base processing task of a certain factory last year was decisively influenced by the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. This enabled some brother factories to produce products urgently needed for the construction of the motherland at an earlier date. The basic scale of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant's construction and the commissioning of some giant machines have not only further strengthened the confidence of the vast number of employees in the victory of construction, but also greatly inspired the vast number of farmers in the nearby areas. They said, "This factory is so big! Let's build it quickly! Make tractors for us soon."

The fact that the construction of the heavy machinery plant has achieved a basic victory once again eloquently proves that the liberated Chinese working class and the laboring people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, relying on their own diligence, courage, and wisdom, and relying on the guidance of Soviet advanced design ideas and the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, can create any miracle. At the same time, it also shows that our country's policy of focusing on key construction projects, concentrating national manpower, material resources, and financial resources to strive for the early completion of projects of decisive significance to the whole country, is very correct.

At the beginning of the plant's construction, the problems that existed, like in other parts of the country, were mainly that the tasks were heavy and the subjective forces were weak. It is said that under normal circumstances, designing such a large factory would require a design team of 150 engineers and technicians to be competent. However, at that time, there were only 23 engineers and associate engineers, and 64 technicians, and everyone was doing this for the first time, with no experience and a lack of information, so there were many difficulties. The factory Party committee clearly put forward the call to "learn from the Soviet Union," and everyone launched a wave of learning. Many technical personnel first learned Russian, and while learning, they buried themselves in collecting relevant Soviet materials and began translating the Soviet "Encyclopedia." In the design, some fundamental mistakes were also made, but they were corrected in time with the help of Soviet experts. For example, under the influence of the thinking of being fond of greatness and seeking quick success, and being unrealistic, the distances between the workshops on the general layout plan were all over 150 meters. It is said that this was in order to "expand without limit in the future and develop into independent factories respectively." The seriousness of this error would create an extremely unreasonable state of production, greatly reduce labor productivity, increase product costs, and cause immeasurable losses to future enterprise management and production management. Soviet expert Comrade Klimsky, after studying the preliminary design drawings in the spring of 1951, criticized this erroneous thinking and revised the plan to manufacture a wide variety of products. He pointed out that the scale and products of the factory must be determined according to realistic technical conditions, and then advanced quotas should be adopted to consider equipment in order to give full play to production efficiency. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the scattered and isolated workshops were transformed into a compact and organically connected whole. As a result of the concrete adoption of Soviet indexes and materials, the engineering and technical personnel improved their political and technical level through practice, and also completed the design task. This laid the foundation for the plant to embark on the road to success.

Relying on our own organized basic engineering teams to carry out construction, learning while doing, and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers, is also an important reason for the basic victory of the plant's construction. At the beginning, most of the projects were contracted to private merchants, and the result was high costs, slow progress, and poor quality. After the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the factory Party committee and administrative leaders clearly put forward the policy of relying on our own strength to organize construction. First, basic leadership organizations and engineering brigades were established. With the active support of workers from Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places and from various factories in Taiyuan, a group of construction technicians were transferred. Relying on these key members, the construction force was continuously expanded, the technical level of workers was improved, and construction management cadres were trained by means of apprenticeship and short-term training classes. Since "July 1" last year, a campaign to increase production and practice economy, with finding clever methods, promoting advanced experience, and improving quality as its main content, has been launched on the construction site. In this way, the progress of the project was accelerated, materials were saved, and the quality of the project was guaranteed. A certain project was originally planned to use 2,180 tons of steel, but after careful calculation by the employees of the blanking and punching groups, 109 tons were saved, saving the country wealth worth more than 1 billion yuan. A certain project required the on-site pouring of more than 800 concrete piles, but we did not have the equipment or experience to drive such piles. In this case, some people contacted a capitalist foreign firm in Shanghai, asking them to undertake the work. The boss there thought he had caught us by the "pigtails," and raised his thumbs while bargaining, and would not do it at a fair price. The hardworking, brave, and intelligent workers did not pay attention to his tricks, but thought of ways to do it themselves. Everyone put forward many rationalization proposals, and modified cranes to replace pile drivers, so that the foundation project was built very firmly and completed according to plan. This is how we relied on the masses to overcome numerous difficulties.

Of course, the complete victory of the plant's construction still requires many arduous tasks to be continued in order to strive for early realization. At the same time, the road traveled in the past two and a half years has not been smooth sailing. In terms of organization and leadership, we feel that the following experiences and lessons are worth remembering:

1. Basic construction work has its own laws, and one cannot go beyond the necessary steps. First of all, a thorough survey, research, and analysis must be made of the topography, soil, and groundwater flow conditions near the factory site. The plant has also done a lot of work in this area, but it is far from enough. In the past, the reason why no accidents have occurred due to poor geological conditions is not so much a guarantee based on scientific evidence as it is a coincidence of "unique location." This is risky and also a fluke, and we should take it as a warning.

2. When establishing a new factory, there must be a clear plan in advance for what products to produce. This is the main basis for design work. The plant modified the unreasonable design drawings with the help of Soviet experts, and finally did not make a big mistake. However, some parts still cannot be specifically designed and arranged, so that they can be modified more conveniently in the future. This raises a question for the higher-level enterprise leadership organs, that is, when building a factory, it must be clearly stipulated what kind of products the factory should produce. Without a clear and detailed product plan, the accuracy of the design work is difficult to guarantee, and complete rationality cannot be achieved in terms of the enterprise's future production management and operation.

3. The reason why the plant's construction could proceed smoothly was that two problems were solved at the beginning of the construction. First, the nearby railway branch lines and highway trunk lines were completed as soon as possible, ensuring that thousands of tons of building materials arrived at the construction site continuously. Second, a repair workshop was established as soon as possible during the construction of the plant, which played a great role in guaranteeing the timely repair and replacement of the tools and machinery required for the construction of the plant. These two links must be grasped in advance in the leadership work.

The fact that the construction of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has achieved a basic victory shows that we have the strength to build new and complex factories, and we have the confidence to accelerate the industrial construction of our motherland.

    太原重型机器厂建厂经验的重大意义
    中国共产党太原市委员会书记　韩纯德
    在太原创建的我国第一个重型机器厂，是规模巨大的、对我国工业化有决定意义的企业之一。两年半来太原重型机器厂建厂成功的经验，或是走过弯路的教训，不论对于领导干部和广大职工来说，或是对于我国即将建设的新式大企业的艰巨事业来说，都有着最现实的意义。
    三年前，全国第一次机器工业会议开会时，人们对于建设这样一个重型机器厂，还认为只是一个美好的理想。但是随着祖国经济恢复时期的结束，现在我们已经看到这种理想逐渐成为事实了。该厂主要车间即将陆续落成，原计划在五年内完成的工程，职工们有信心也有条件争取在四年内提前完成。在“边建设、边投入生产”的正确方针下，这个厂现在已经有条件为国内其他兄弟厂矿进行大型设备配件的加工了。去年某厂薄板机底座加工工作的胜利成功，太原重型机器厂起了决定性的作用。这就使某些兄弟厂能早日出产祖国建设急需的产品。太原重型机器厂建厂的粗具规模，某些巨型机器投入生产，不仅进一步坚定了广大职工建设胜利的信心，而且大大鼓舞了附近地区的广大农民。他们说：“这个工厂真大呀！快快建设起来吧！早些给咱们
        造拖拉机。”
    重型机器厂建厂已获得基本胜利的事实，又一次雄辩地证明：解放了的中国工人阶级和劳动人民，在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，依靠自己的勤劳、勇敢和智慧，依靠苏联先进设计思想的指导和苏联专家无私的帮助，是可以创造出任何奇迹的。同时，也说明了我们国家采取重点建设的方针，集中全国人力、物力、财力争取早日完成对全国有决定意义的工程，是十分正确的。
    在建厂之初，该厂存在的问题，和全国各地一样，主要是任务重大，主观力量薄弱。据说在正常的情况下，设计一个这样大的工厂，需要有包括一百五十位工程技术人员的设计团才能胜任。但当时只有工程师、副工程师二十三人，技术员六十四人，而且大家对于设计这样的工厂，还是第一次，既无经验，又缺资料，困难很多。工厂党委明确提出了“向苏联学习”的号召，大家掀起了学习热潮。很多技术人员首先学习俄文，一面学习，一面埋头搜集苏联的有关资料，并着手翻译苏联“百科全书”。在设计中，也曾犯过一些原则性的错误，但在苏联专家帮助下，及时纠正了。例如在好大喜功、不切实际的思想支配下，总布置图上各车间的距离均在一百五十公尺以上。据说这是为了“将来可以无限制地扩展，各自发展成为一个独立的工场”。这种错误的严重性，将会造成生产过程极不合理的状态，会大大减低劳动生产率，增大产品成本，给今后企业经营、生产管理造成不可计量的损失。苏联专家克林姆斯基同志在一九五一年春研究了初步设计图样之后，批判了这种错误思想，修正了准备制造种类繁多的产品方案。他指出，必须根据现实技术条件来决定工厂的规模和产品，再采用先进定额来考虑设备，以便充分发挥生产效能。根据苏联专家的建议，将零零落落的、各自孤立的车间，变为紧凑的有机联系的一个整体。具体采用苏联指数与资料的结果，工程技术人员从实践中提高了自己的政治和技术水平，同时也完成了设计任务。这样就为该厂奠定了走向成功道路的基础。
    依靠自己组织的基本的工程队进行施工，边做边学，发挥广大工人的积极性和创造性，也是该厂建设获得基本胜利的一个重要原因。开始时，大部工程是包给私商承做，结果是花钱多、进度慢、质量还坏。经过伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动，该厂党委和行政领导明确地提出了依靠自己力量组织施工的方针。首先建立了基本的领导机构和工程大队，在上海、北京、天津等地和太原市各厂工人的积极支援下，又调来了一批建筑技术工人，依靠这些骨干，用带徒弟、开短期训练班的办法，不断地扩大施工力量，提高工人技术水平，培养施工管理干部。自去年“七一”以来，在工地展开了以找窍门、推广先进经验、提高质量为主要内容的增产节约竞赛运动。这样，就加速了工程进度，节约了材料，并保证了工程的质量。某项工程原计划需用钢料二千一百八十吨，经下料、剪冲两个小组职工精打细算，节约了一百零九吨，为国家节省了价值十亿多元的财富。某项工程需要就地浇灌水泥桩八百余根，但我们没有打这种桩的设备和经验。在这种情况下，某些人曾到上海一家资本主义国家的洋行接洽，让它们承做。那里的老板以为抓住了我们的“小辫子”，翘起大拇指讲价钱，公道价钱他还不干。勤劳勇敢而又聪明的工人同志们，不理他那一套，自己想办法动手干，大家提出了许多合理化建议，改装起重机以代替打桩机，把基础工程筑得很坚固，并按计划完工了。我们就是这样依靠群众，战胜了重重困难的。
    当然，该厂建设的全部胜利，还需要继续进行许多艰巨的工作，才能争取早日实现。同时，过去两年半走过的道路，也不是一帆风顺的。在组织领导方面，我们觉得有以下几点经验教训值得记取：
    一、基本建设工作是有其一定规律性的，不能超越必要的步骤。首先必须对厂基附近的地势、土壤、地下水流情况，作周密的勘测、研究、分析。该厂也曾做了许多有关这方面的工作，但是很不够。过去所以还没有因地质不好发生什么事故，与其说是有了科学依据的保证，还不如说是“得地独厚”的偶合更合乎实际。这是冒险，也是侥幸，我们应引以为戒。
    二、建立一个新厂，必须事前有明确的生产什么产品的方案。这是设计工作的主要依据。该厂在苏联专家帮助下修改了不合理的设计图样，终于未铸成大错。但有些部分，还不能做出具体的设计布置，以备今后能较便利地修改。这样就给上级企业领导机关提出一个问题，即在建设一个工厂的时候，必须明确规定这个厂要生产什么样的产品。没有明确详细的产品方案，设计工作的准确性是很难保证的，对企业今后生产管理和经营方面，也不能做到完全的合理。
    三、该厂施工所以能顺利进行，是在建厂之初，曾注意解决了两个问题。第一、附近的铁路支线、公路干线早日修通，保证了成千成万吨的建筑材料源源到达工地。第二、建厂时尽先建立了修造车间，就近及时地修配了建厂所需的工具、机械起了很大的保证作用。这两个环节，在领导工作上事先必须抓住。
    太原重型机器厂建厂获得基本胜利的事实，说明了我们有力量建设新型的复杂的工厂，有信心加速我们祖国的工业建设。
