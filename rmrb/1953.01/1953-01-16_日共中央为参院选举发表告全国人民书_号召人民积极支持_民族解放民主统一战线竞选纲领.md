Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 15th: The Japanese House of Councillors election will be held in May, at which time half of all Councillors will be re-elected. The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party has issued an open letter to the nation and a "National Liberation Democratic United Front Election Program."

The message states: The Japanese people are now facing an unprecedented crisis in history. The American imperialists, having suffered defeat in the war of aggression against Korea and finding themselves at a dead end, are further strengthening their military rule over Japan, attempting to revive Japanese militarism. The Yoshida Liberal Party government, slaves of the American warmongers, dream of restoring Japan to its former role as the "aggressor of Asia," and are colluding with the United States, thereby creating the current national crisis.

The message calls on the people of the country to unite as one and fight to save the motherland and the national crisis. The message says: The Japanese people must put forward all demands, unite all forces opposing Yoshida, give these traitorous bandits a powerful blow, and overthrow them.

The message says: At a time when the Japanese people are facing a national crisis, the Japanese Communist Party once again puts forward the "National Liberation Democratic United Front Election Program" and asks the people of the country to actively support it. The Japanese Communist Party states that even those parties and factions that do not recognize all items of this program can join hands and carry out a united election struggle against war and for patriotism as long as they are united on the point of "opposing the revival of militarism and overthrowing the traitorous Yoshida Liberal Party government." We ask everyone not only to actively support the Japanese Communist Party, but also to actively support all those who support this program.

The Japanese Communist Party's "National Liberation Democratic United Front Election Program" is as follows:

One, oppose the revival of militarism. Do not fight against the nations of Asia. Abolish military bases. Withdraw all occupying forces.

Two, abolish the separate treaty, the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the Japan-U.S. "Administrative Agreement"; abolish the Japan-U.S. Fisheries Agreement. Conclude fisheries agreements between Japan and the Soviet Union and China through peaceful negotiations. Thoroughly implement the Potsdam Proclamation.

Three, conclude a comprehensive peace treaty including the Soviet Union and China, conclude a peace treaty among the five major powers, and immediately stop the Korean War.

Four, establish free, equal, and mutually beneficial relations with all countries.

Five, give freedom to all patriotic movements. Abolish the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." Oppose the prohibition of general strikes, the suppression of demonstrations, and other "public security laws." Oppose amending the election law. Oppose discrimination against other ethnic groups in Japan. Oppose amending the Constitution.

Six, establish a complete social insurance system that can sustain all the people. Abolish the heavy taxes levied for the war. Oppose raising prices. Uphold national culture and national education.

Seven, distribute land to the working farmers. Oppose feudal exploitation and oppression of farmers and fishermen. Oppose land confiscation and forced grain deliveries. Demand farm product prices that do not result in losses for farmers. Provide farmers and fishermen with operating funds.

Eight, demand an eight-hour workday. Oppose unemployment. Oppose intensifying labor. Demand the payment of wages that can sustain a living.
