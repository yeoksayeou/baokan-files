In order to concentrate state funds and implement the policy of focusing on key construction projects, the Central South Financial and Economic Committee, adhering to the principle of "do as little as possible of what can be done or not done, postpone what can be postponed, and only do what must be done," strictly reviewed the cross-year capital construction projects of 1952. The unfinished capital construction projects in the Central South Region in 1952 accounted for more than 40 percent of the total investment in 1952. Based on the needs of national economic construction this year, the review revealed that not every project was urgently needed. Therefore, the Central South Financial and Economic Committee convened leading cadres from relevant departments to form the "Central South Cross-Year Project Review Committee" to conduct a comprehensive review of the unfinished projects of the Central South Region's financial, economic, political and legal, cultural and educational, and other systems in 1952. The requirements for the review were: to specifically understand whether each unit's project followed the capital construction work procedures, whether the project was started after the plan was approved and designed; what the current project progress is, whether there are any phenomena such as accumulation of funds, stagnant materials, and waste and losses. After the review, the committee considered which projects could be postponed or cancelled, and which projects should have their funding reduced, based on the state's requirements and current construction capabilities. The goal was to concentrate funds on major national industrial construction. Currently, eleven units including the Central South Branches of the Central South Finance, Education, Health, and Communications Bank have formed three inspection groups, which will depart in two batches to inspect the cross-year projects of 1952 in forty-three capital construction units in various regions. In addition, the Central South Financial and Economic Committee also instructed the Financial and Economic Committees of the provincial people's governments to organize inspection groups to inspect the capital construction projects of five or six units in each province.

    中南财委严格审查跨年度基本建设工程
    为集中国家资金，执行重点建设的方针，中南财政经济委员会本着“可办可不办的尽量不办，可缓办的缓办，必须办的才办”的原则，严格审查了一九五二年的跨年度基本建设工程。中南区一九五二年未完成的基本建设工程约占一九五二年投资总额的百分之四十以上。根据今年国家经济建设的需要，在检查中发现这些工程并不是每项都迫切需要举办。因此中南财政经济委员会召集各有关部门负责干部组成“中南跨年度工程审查委员会”，对中南区财经、政法、文教等系统的一九五二年未完成的工程进行全面的检查。检查的要求是：具体了解各单位的工程是否按照基本建设工作程序，经过批准计划，进行设计才动工的；目前工程进度如何，有无积压资金、呆滞材料和浪费损失等现象。检查后再根据国家的要求和目前施工力量来考虑那些工程可以缓办或不办，那些工程应该缩减资金等。目的要达到集中资金投入国家主要工业建设。目前中南财政、教育、卫生、交通银行中南区行等十一个单位已组成了三个检查组，将分两批出发各地检查四十三个基本建设单位的一九五二年跨年度工程。此外，中南财政经济委员会也指示各省人民政府财政经济委员会组织检查组，每省检查五、六个单位的基本建设工程。（新华社）
