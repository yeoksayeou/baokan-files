My Experience in Trial-Manufacturing a "Demonstration Head Mirror"
Chi Rucheng, Associate Professor, Department of Otolaryngology, Northwest Medical College

Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao for the past three years, I have gradually established a worldview of serving the people. I am determined to overcome all difficulties in teaching and ensure that I teach the students well. It was under this ideological guidance that I trial-manufactured the "Demonstration Head Mirror" and achieved success. Although this is a small success, it is helpful to the teaching work of our Department of Otolaryngology.

Why did I create the "Demonstration Head Mirror"? As everyone knows, the ear, nose, throat, and other organs are all very deep and small cavities. When there is no disease, it is not easy to see their interior, and it is even more difficult to observe when there is a disease. This caused me a lot of difficulties when I first learned otolaryngology, and thus wasted a lot of valuable time. Later, in teaching, although I wanted to teach the students everything I knew, because there were always some angular differences between the light of the head mirror, my line of sight, and the students' line of sight, what the students saw was never completely consistent with what I saw. In many cases, I saw a certain part and wanted the students to see it too; but when I turned my head to the side, by the time the students turned their line of sight, the light had changed. The same is true during surgery. After inserting surgical instruments into the ear, nose, or throat, only I could see it, and the interns couldn't see it at all. The students also found learning otolaryngology to be a great hardship. In the past, because there were few interns, I could teach them slowly. Now, the number of students has greatly increased. It is not only unclear for the students to be taught one by one with the head mirror, but also time does not allow it. Therefore, how to allow the majority of students to simultaneously see the inside of a person's ear, nose, or throat to discover the condition of the disease has become an urgent problem to be solved.

At first, I thought of reflex cameras, microscopes, and the reflectors of projectors, and attempted to use triangular prisms and strong lights to create an otolaryngology entity demonstration projector. I drew some diagrams according to optical principles and made a preliminary design. However, due to limitations in time and material conditions, I was unable to conduct experiments. So I thought of using a simpler method to solve the problem. One night, I suddenly thought that using a reflector was the simplest and most economical way. I got out of bed, turned on the light, and woke up my wife, who was startled awake. She held a mirror, and I put on a headlamp and shone the light into the ear canal of our sleeping young son. My wife held the mirror at a forty-five-degree angle next to the headlamp, and we experimented together. As a result, when I saw the child's eardrum, she also saw the child's eardrum from the side. This discovery made me extremely happy.

The next day, I went to a mirror shop and bought two small mirrors, set them at a forty-five-degree angle, and tied them to the head mirror with copper wire. When I experimented in the clinic, two students could simultaneously see the detailed structure of an eardrum, as well as the movement of the vocal cords when the larynx was making sounds and breathing. In addition, I could use a probe to point out every tiny place for them to see, so that they could clearly see things they had never seen before. In this way, I showed it to every student in the department in a very short time. In the past, during student internships, although the demonstrator was exhausted and the students wasted a lot of time, they still couldn't see clearly. Now, with two students simultaneously under the guidance of the probe, they clearly saw what they needed to see. This not only saved teaching time but also improved teaching effectiveness.

The initial experiment was successful, and a large class of one hundred and twenty students saw the eardrum. But this tool was not perfect enough. Therefore, I improved the structure of the "Demonstration Head Mirror" by adding two small mirrors on each side of the head mirror (each small mirror at a different angle), so that I could teach four students simultaneously. In order to improve the effect, I added four mirror pieces on each side of the headlight, and two more on the top, each angle differing by more than ten degrees, so that there were four students on each side, and two students above the patient's body simultaneously seeing the indicated place from each small mirror. After one internship, the students could see the eardrum and the condition of the larynx. Now I want to further improve the "Demonstration Head Mirror" by adding a pair of telescope-like lenses in front of each small reflector, so that students can not only see what they need to see, but also see detailed, magnified images.

The "Demonstration Head Mirror" can not only be applied to teaching in otolaryngology but also to ophthalmology and obstetrics and gynecology. I hope that teachers in medical schools across the country will conduct joint research to improve teaching effectiveness.

### 我试作“示教额镜”的经过

    我试作“示教额镜”的经过
    西北医学院耳鼻咽喉学系副教授  迟汝澄
    三年来在党和毛主席的教导下，我逐步确立了为人民服务的人生观。我下定决心要克服教学中的一切困难，保证教好同学。就在这种思想指导下，我试造了“示教额镜”，并且获得了成功。这虽然是一个小小的成功，但对我们的耳鼻咽喉学系的教学工作是有帮助的。
    为什么要创作“示教额镜”呢？大家都知道，耳、鼻、咽喉等器官，都是些很深很小的腔隙，在没有病的时候，它们的内部就不容易看到，有了病就更不容易观察。这曾使我在初学耳鼻咽喉学时发生很多困难，因而也就白白浪费了很多的宝贵时间。后来在教学中我虽然想把知道的一切都教给同学，可是因为额镜的光线、自己的视线和同学的视线中间总有些角度的差别，同学们所看到的，总不能和自己所看到的完全一致。在许多时候，自己看到了某一部分，也愿意同学看到它；可是当自己的头向旁一摆，等到同学把视线转过来，光线也就变了。在施手术时也是如此。把手术器械伸进耳、鼻或咽喉以后，只能自己看见，实习的同学根本就看不见。同学也就深以学习耳鼻咽喉科为苦。过去因实习的同学少，还可以慢慢地教，现在同学的数量大大增加了，用额镜一个一个地示教，不但同学看不清楚，而且时间上也不允许。因此，怎样才能让多数同学同时看到一个人耳、鼻或咽喉的内部，以发现病变的情况，就成为一个急待解决的问题。
    起初，我想到反光照像机、显微镜和幻灯机的反光镜，便企图利用三棱镜和强光灯来制造一个耳鼻咽喉科实体示教幻灯。我按照光学原理，画了一些图，作了一个初步的设计。但是因受到时间和物质条件的限制，未能进行试验。于是我便想用一个比较简单的方法来解决这个问题。一天晚上我忽然想到利用反光镜片是一个最简单最经济的办法。我就从床上爬起来，把电灯开亮，叫起了被惊醒的爱人。由她拿一面镜子，我带上额灯把光线射到正在熟睡的幼子耳道里，又让我的爱人拿着镜子用四十五度的角度放在额灯旁边，我们这样共同试验了一下。结果，当我看到孩子的耳鼓膜时，她在旁边也看到了孩子的耳鼓膜。这一发现，使我高兴极了。
    第二天我跑到镜子铺里，买了二个很小的镜子，取四十五度的角度，用铜丝把镜子绑在额镜上。在门诊所试验时，有两个同学同时可以看到一个耳鼓膜的详细构造，也看到了喉头在发声、呼吸时声带的运动。此外，我还可以用探针指示着每一个细小的地方给他们看，使他们可以清楚地看到以往没有看见的东西。这样在很短的时间，我指示给科内每一个同学都看了。过去在同学实习时，虽然示教的人弄得精疲力竭，同学们浪费了很多的时间，还是看不清楚。如今同时有两个同学在探针指示之下，清清楚楚地看到了要看的东西。这样，不但节省了教学时间，而且提高了教学的效果。
    初步试验成功了，一百二十人的大班同学都看见了耳鼓膜。但这种工具还不够完善。因此我又改进了“示教额镜”的构造，在额镜两旁各加二个小镜
    （每个小镜的角度不同），这样就可以同时向四个同学示教。为了提高效果，我又在额灯两侧各附镜片四个，上面再附上二个，每个的角度相差十余度，这样在两旁各有四个同学，在病人的身体上方有二个同学同时由每一个小镜内看到所指示的地方。实习一次，同学们就可以看到耳鼓膜以及喉头的情况。现在我想再进一步改进“示教额镜”，在每个小反光镜前面加一对望远镜式的镜片，使同学不但能看到所要看的东西，而且可以看到详细的放大的影像。
    “示教额镜”不仅可以应用在耳鼻咽喉科的教学上，也可以把它应用到眼科、妇产科方面，希望各地医学校的教师共同进行研究，以提高教学效果。
