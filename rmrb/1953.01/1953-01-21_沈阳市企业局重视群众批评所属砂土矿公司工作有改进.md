    Shenyang Municipal Enterprise Bureau Attaches Importance to Public Criticism; Subordinate Sand and Soil Mining Company Improves Work

    To the Editor: The Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Labor Protection Department criticized the problem of certain leading cadres of the Shenyang Sand and Soil Mining Company not paying attention to workers' working conditions and making false self-criticisms in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on August 17th last year. The Shenyang Municipal Enterprise Bureau—the superior leading body of the Sand and Soil Mining Company—attached great importance to this issue. With the assistance of relevant agencies such as the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the local enterprise trade union, the Enterprise Bureau conducted a focused inspection of the company's subordinate mines. The director of the Enterprise Bureau personally took charge of inviting responsible comrades from relevant agencies to hold a meeting to study and analyze the situation of the company's subordinate mines. Although the manager of the Sand and Soil Mining Company made a preliminary self-criticism, he still lacked a correct understanding of the problem; the Enterprise Bureau has ordered him to suspend his duties for introspection, instructing him to continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism, and be responsible for formulating a concrete plan to improve work.

    Due to the importance attached by the leading comrades of the Enterprise Bureau, the living conditions and working conditions of the workers in the various mines under the Sand and Soil Mining Company have greatly improved. Canteens and kitchens have been established, and the drinking water problem has been solved. Shoulder pads, thigh pads, and gloves and other labor protection products have been issued to the workers. The company has also hired two doctors to solve the problem of workers' injury and illness treatment. Unreasonable aspects of the previous wage system have been adjusted. The tools previously provided by the workers themselves have been purchased by the company at market prices; now all the tools used by the workers are supplied by the public.

    Finally, some problems have not yet been completely resolved, such as many workers not having dormitories, and certain labor protection products not yet being issued to workers... Of course, there are objective difficulties in completely solving these problems; but it is hoped that the company will further strengthen its subjective efforts and continue to solve all the problems that can currently be solved.

    沈阳市企业局重视群众批评所属砂土矿公司工作有改进
    编辑同志：沈阳市总工会劳保部对沈阳砂土矿公司某些领导干部不重视工人劳动条件并作假检讨问题，在去年八月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏提出批评。沈阳市企业局——砂土矿公司的上级领导机关对这个问题很重视。在市劳动局、市总工会、地方企业工会等有关机关的协助下，企业局对该公司所属各矿作了重点检查。企业局局长又亲自负责邀请有关机关负责同志开会，研究、分析了该公司所属各矿的情况。砂土矿公司经理虽作了初步检讨，但对问题仍无正确认识；企业局已令其停职反省，责成他继续深入检讨，并负责作出改进工作的具体计划。
    由于企业局领导同志的重视，砂土矿公司所属各矿工人生活情况和劳动条件有了很大改善。食堂、厨房设立了，吃水问题解决了。肩垫、大腿垫和手套等劳动保护品发给工人了。公司还聘请了两个医生，解决工人伤病治疗问题。过去工资制度中不合理的地方已进行调整。工人过去自备的工具，已由公司负责按市价收买；现在工人使用的工具已全部由公家供给。
    最后，有一些问题还没得到彻底解决，像很多工人没有宿舍，某些劳动防护用品还没发给工人……。当然，要彻底解决这些问题有客观上的困难；但希望该公司进一步加强主观努力，继续解决目前可能解决的一切问题。  李振江
