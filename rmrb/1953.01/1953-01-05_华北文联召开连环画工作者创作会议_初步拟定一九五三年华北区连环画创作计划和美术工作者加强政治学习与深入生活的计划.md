The preparatory committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles convened a creation meeting for serial picture artists in the North China region in Beijing from December 17th to 25th. Thirty-six fine arts workers from various provinces and cities in North China attended the meeting. Representatives from units such as the China National Fine Arts Workers Association, Lianhuanhua Bao (Serial Pictures) newspaper, the Zhan You She (Comrades' Society) of the North China Military Region, and the Inner Mongolia Pictorial of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also participated.

The meeting determined that the creation of serial pictures in the North China region has achieved progress over the past two years. According to incomplete statistics, the number of creations has reached 888 sets. Most of these creations have been published in newspapers and magazines in various provinces and cities, and some have been published as individual books. Some of the better works, such as "The 30th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party," "From Beginning to End," "Resolutely Overcome Bureaucratic Work Style," and "Organizing Together is Stronger than Going it Alone," closely aligned with the current political and production movements, were welcomed by the broad masses of people and played a certain educational role. This is because the authors of these works had a relatively serious creative attitude, carefully considered the techniques, and critically absorbed some of the advantages of old serial pictures in terms of presentation.

The meeting also pointed out that the vast majority of serial picture works in the North China region in the past two years have serious shortcomings of formulaic and conceptualized defects and shoddy workmanship. The reason for this situation is mainly that the authors have not truly immersed themselves in life, merely regarding adapting and excerpting articles from newspapers and magazines as their main source of creation, and also lacking a serious and conscientious attitude in artistic production.

The meeting conducted a full discussion on the above-mentioned issues. Zhang Pan-shi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and, in conjunction with some practical issues raised during the meeting, gave detailed instructions on how to improve the ideological and artistic level of the authors. After discussion, the participants unanimously recognized the importance of immersing oneself in life for artistic work and adopted four creation covenants: (1) Fine arts workers must immerse themselves in life, draw creative materials from real life, and constantly transform themselves. (2) Strengthen the study of political and artistic theory, and constantly improve their skills to improve the ideological and artistic level of their works, and strive to create better serial pictures. (3) Fine arts workers are accountable to the people with their works, so they must strengthen labor and strive to create. (4) Make plans, ensure completion, and oppose shoddy workmanship. The meeting also preliminarily formulated the 1953 North China Region Serial Picture Creation Plan and the Plan for Fine Arts Workers to Strengthen Political Study and Immerse Themselves in Life, so that the creative level of fine arts workers in the North China region can be further improved and be able to undertake the glorious task of coordinating and reflecting the large-scale economic and cultural construction of the motherland.

    华北文联召开连环画工作者创作会议
    初步拟定一九五三年华北区连环画创作计划和美术工作者加强政治学习与深入生活的计划
    华北文学艺术界联合会筹备委员会十二月十七日到二十五日在北京召开了华北区连环画工作者创作会议。出席会议的有华北各省、市美术工作者三十六人，中华全国美术工作者协会、连环画报社、华北军区战友社和内蒙古自治区内蒙画报社等单位也都派有代表参加会议。
    会议认为：两年多来，华北区的连环画创作是有成绩的。根据不完全的统计，创作数目已达到八百八十八套，这些创作大部分已经刊登在各省、市的报纸、杂志上，有的还出了单行本。其中有一部分较好的作品，如“中国共产党三十周年”“从头看尾”“坚决克服官僚主义作风”和“组织起来比单干强”等作品，都能紧密地配合当前的政治运动及生产运动，为广大人民群众所欢迎，并对人民群众起了一定的教育作用。这是由于这些作品的作者创作态度比较严肃，在技术上曾认真推敲，在表现形式上也批判地吸收了旧连环画上的一些优点。
    会议也指出：两年来华北区绝大部分的连环画作品中，严重地存在着公式化概念化的缺点和粗制滥造的现象。所以产生这一情况的原因，主要是作者们没有真正地深入生活，仅仅把改编、摘录报章杂志的文章当作自己主要的创作泉源，在艺术制作上也缺乏严肃认真的劳动态度。
    会议针对上述问题，进行了充分的讨论。中共中央华北局宣传部部长张磐石曾出席会议，结合会中提出的一些实际问题，就如何提高作者的思想和艺术水平问题，作了详尽的指示。经过讨论，与会者一致认识到深入生活对于艺术工作的重要，并通过了四项创作公约：（一）美术工作者要一律深入生活，从现实生活中吸取创作素材，并要求不断地改造自己。（二）加强政治艺术理论的学习，并不断地提高自己的技巧，提高作品的思想艺术水平，为创作出更好的连环画而努力。
    （三）美术工作者是以作品向人民交代任务的，因此必须加强劳动，努力创作。（四）作出计划，保证完成，反对粗制滥造的作风。会议并初步拟定了一九五三年的华北区连环画创作计划和美术工作者加强政治学习与深入生活的计划，以便使华北区美术工作者创作水平进一步提高，能够担负起配合和反映祖国的大规模经济和文化建设的光荣任务。（新华社）
