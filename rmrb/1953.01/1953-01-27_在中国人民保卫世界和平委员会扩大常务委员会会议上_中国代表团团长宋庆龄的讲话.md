The Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, entrusted by the people of the motherland, attended the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna. This historically significant congress achieved great success. The spirit and resolutions of the congress have been welcomed and supported by the broad masses of people around the world, uniting peace-loving people from all countries more broadly and closely. At the same time, it has made the imperialist warmongers even more panic-stricken. The Chinese delegation completed the tasks entrusted to it by the people of the motherland at the congress. Now, the delegates have returned to the motherland one after another. Our future work is to convey the spirit and resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress to the people of the whole country, and together with the people of the whole country, further dedicate ourselves to the cause of peace.

On its way back home, the Chinese delegation passed through the territory of the great Soviet Union and received a warm welcome and hospitality from the Soviet people. We saw that the Soviet people, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, were engaged in communist construction with unparalleled enthusiasm. We also saw the continuous improvement of the Soviet people's material and cultural life. At the same time, we felt even more deeply the Soviet people's kindness and warmth towards us. Every Soviet person loves the new China and Comrade Mao Zedong. They expressed great concern and hope for China's various constructions and are willing to help us at any time. This brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a strong fortress of world peace. The people of China and the Soviet Union are advancing side by side on the road of peaceful construction. We have sufficient strength to create a prosperous and happy life, and we also have sufficient strength to defend our motherland and defend peace.

When we were abroad, we were excited to learn that our motherland would continue to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in 1953, begin the first five-year economic construction plan, and convene the National People's Congress. At that time, all our delegates applauded enthusiastically for this news for several minutes. What a magnificent scene and endless hope the motherland presented before us, making us feel even more the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, making us feel even more how closely the motherland is linked to the cause of peace, and making us deeply believe that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, will surely complete the construction tasks and will surely continue to make significant contributions to defending world peace.

Finally, let us shout:

Long live peace!

    在中国人民保卫世界和平委员会扩大常务委员会会议上
    中国代表团团长宋庆龄的讲话
    出席世界人民和平大会中国代表团，受了祖国人民的委托，出席了在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会。这次具有历史意义的大会获得了很大的成就，大会的精神和决议受到了全世界广大人民的欢迎和拥护，使得世界各国爱好和平的人民更广泛地、更紧密地团结起来了，同时，也使得帝国主义战争贩子们更加惊慌失措了。中国代表团在大会中完成了祖国人民所委托的任务。现在，代表们已经先后回到祖国来了。今后我们的工作，是要把世界人民和平大会的精神和决议传达给全国人民，并和全国人民一道，进一步致力于和平事业。
    中国代表团在归国途中，经过伟大苏联的国土，受到了苏联人民的热烈欢迎和招待。我们看到了在斯大林同志和苏联共产党领导下的苏联人民，正以无比的热情进行着共产主义建设。也看到了苏联人民的物质生活和文化生活继续不断的提高。同时，我们更体会到苏联人民对我们的亲切和热诚，每个苏联人都热爱着新中国和毛泽东同志，他们对中国的各项建设表示极大的关心和希望，并愿意随时帮助我们。中苏两国人民的这种兄弟般的友谊，乃是世界和平的坚强堡垒。中苏两国人民正在和平建设的大道上并肩前进，我们有充分的力量创造繁荣幸福的生活，也有充分的力量保卫祖国、保卫和平。
    在国外的时候，我们就怀着兴奋的心情得悉祖国将于一九五三年继续加强抗美援朝运动，开始第一个五年经济建设计划，和召开全国人民代表大会。当时我们全体代表曾为了这个消息热烈鼓掌达数分钟之久。祖国在我们眼前展现了何等壮丽的景象和无穷的希望，使我们更加感到祖国的伟大可爱，使我们更加感到祖国与和平事业联系得多么紧密，使我们深信中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，必能完成建设任务，必能不断地对保卫世界和平作出重大的贡献。
    最后，让我们高呼：
    和平万岁！
