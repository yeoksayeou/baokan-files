The Mudanjiang City branch of the China Department Store Company suffers from an exceptionally chaotic management system, severely impacting the turnover rate of goods and accumulating a large amount of capital.

After the company purchases goods, they must go through many levels before they can be allocated to shops or retail departments for sale. It generally takes six to seven days for each item to go from purchase to display on the shop counter.

The company's financial system is very chaotic, with common phenomena such as goods without accounts, accounts without goods, and inconsistencies between goods and accounts. For example, fifteen pairs of leather shoes, three leather bags, a box of mouthwash cups, a box of autumn clothes, and two commercial vehicles worth 600 million yuan in stock cannot be found in the accounts at all; conversely, the warehouse does not have seventy striped floral bedsheets and one hundred and twenty-six boxes of ink that are listed in the accounts; 70% to 80% of the accounts of accountants and salespersons do not match the goods.

The losses caused by the chaotic system are staggering. Large quantities of beer, condensed milk, and canned goods have deteriorated; more than two hundred pairs of white rubber shoes have turned into black rubber shoes; many pens, rice bowls, glass and ceramic items are damaged and piled up all over the yard; many 200-watt light bulbs are covered in red rust and need to be cleaned before they can be sold. Packing wood boxes, cloth skins, iron strips, and burlap sacks are thrown around randomly, occupying half of the warehouse. The company rarely buys firewood to cook food, mostly burning wooden boxes, burning more than five thousand in the past two years, worth 150 million yuan in RMB.

The phenomenon of staff using and damaging goods is also very serious. When the director of the company's First Retail Department, Zu Shoutian, got married, he used five commodity harmonicas to play music and dance; a pricing clerk used pricing as an excuse to move a commodity harmonium away and damage it; female salespersons used commodity combs and mirrors as their own dressing table utensils; a warehouse keeper took out a box of children's toys from the warehouse to play with, and when the business department urgently needed to sell the toys, they could not be released from the warehouse in time, and half of the box of toys had become waste products by the time it was released.

These chaotic management issues in the company have caused unnecessary accumulation and damage of goods, and have also affected the turnover of capital. The company's capital was originally planned to turn over 2.5 times in half a year, but it only turned over 1.1 times.

In order to improve management, the company, with the help of the work inspection team of the Songjiang Province Department Store Company and under the leadership of the local Party committee and government, has taken the following measures: 1. Held meetings of purchasing agents, warehouse keepers, price controllers, allocation personnel, and salespersons to study the reasons for the slow turnover of goods, signed contact contracts, and established a commodity allocation procedure handover registration book, reducing the commodity turnover time from the past seven days to two and a half days. 2. Combined with the current central work, vigorously promote industrial products, quickly put all the goods in the warehouse on the retail shelves, and expand publicity, so that the amount of money earned has risen rapidly. 3. Through mass self-inspection, mutual inspection, and level-by-level inspection, combined with finding waste, finding shortcuts, tapping potential, and putting forward rationalization proposals, launched a production increase and economy campaign. The company is creating conditions for further overcoming the supply system management thinking and implementing the economic accounting system.

    牡丹江市百货公司  经营管理制度混乱
    中国百货公司牡丹江市公司经营管理制度异常混乱，严重影响了商品流转速度，积压了大量资金。
    该公司采购到商品以后，要经过许多层次才能拨给商店或门市部出售。每样货物由采购到摆上门市柜台，一般需要六、七天时间。
    该公司的财务制度很混乱，有货无账、有账无货、货账不符等现象很普遍。如库存的十五双皮鞋、三个皮包、一箱漱口盂、一箱秋季衣服及价值六亿元的两辆商品汽车，在账上根本找不到；相反地，账上有的七十条彩格花床单，一百二十六盒油墨，仓库里却没有货；会计与营业员的账目有百分之七十至八十与商品不符。
    因为制度混乱造成的损耗非常惊人。大批的啤酒、炼乳、罐头都变了质，二百多双白胶鞋变成了黑胶鞋，钢笔、饭碗、玻璃及陶磁器损坏的很多，堆得满院子都是，很多二百度的电灯泡都生了红锈，需要雇人擦洗后才能出售。包装用的木箱子、布皮子、铁腰子、麻袋皮子，随地乱扔，占据了半个仓库。该公司很少买柴火煮饭，大都是烧木箱子，两年来烧了五千多个，价值人民币一亿五千万元。
    工作人员动用和损坏商品的现象也很严重。该公司第一门市部主任祖寿田结婚时，动用了五只商品口琴奏乐跳舞；作价员以作价为藉口，把商品风琴搬去弄坏了；女营业员把商品梳子、镜子当作自己梳装台上的用具；仓库保管员把仓库里的一箱小孩玩具拿出来玩，营业部急需出售玩具时不能及时出库，等这箱玩具出库时，半数已成了废品。
    该公司经营管理上的这些混乱现象，使商品遭受了不必要的积压和损坏，并且影响了资金的周转。该公司的资金原订半年周转二点五次，结果只周转了一点一次。
    为了改善经营管理，该公司在松江省百货公司工作检查组的帮助和当地党委、政府的领导下，已采取了以下措施：一、召开采购员、保管员、物价员、调拨员、营业员会议，研究商品流转缓慢的原因，签订联系合同，建立了商品调拨手续交接登记簿，使商品流转日期由过去的七天降为两天半。二、结合当前中心工作，大力推销工业品，将仓库所有的商品迅速摆到门市上，并扩大宣传，卖钱额因而迅速上升。三、通过群众性的自我检查、互相检查、层层检查，结合找浪费、找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议等办法，展开了增产节约运动。该公司正在为进一步克服供给制经营思想，贯彻经济核算制创造条件。
