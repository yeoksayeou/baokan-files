Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabar, head of the Tibetan Tribute Group, wished at the banquet that the people of Tibet and the Changdu area would further unite, eliminate historical estrangement, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, strive together to consolidate national defense and develop the economic and cultural life of the Tibetan people. Gesang Wangdui, head of the Changdu area Tibetan People's National Day observation delegation, stated: The two-month visit to the motherland's interior has been extremely rewarding. Because everyone has personally witnessed the great achievements of the motherland's construction, their confidence in the development prospects of the Tibetan region has been greatly enhanced. After we return, we will certainly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, work hard to unite and develop production, improve the lives of the people in the Changdu area, and continue to support the People's Liberation Army and consolidate national defense.
