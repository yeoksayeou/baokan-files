    Central Fuel Industry Ministry Petroleum Administration Bureau
    Sends Exploration Workers to Beijing in Two Batches for Study
    Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau Vigorously Strengthens Basic Construction Forces
    According to the policy decided at the First National Petroleum Conference, the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government Fuel Industry Ministry has focused on petroleum exploration geological work in the Northwest for the past three years. Exploration personnel of the bureau have conducted surveys in many new areas in northern Shaanxi and Hexi, re-examined existing "structures," and drilled many exploration wells of varying depths in several areas, obtaining much surface, subsurface, and geophysical data and experience.
    In order to summarize the fieldwork of the past three years, learn from advanced Soviet experience, promote typical examples, and improve the political and professional level of field workers, so as to better meet the large-scale economic construction of the motherland, the bureau decided to concentrate field workers in Beijing in two batches for study. The first phase began in November of last year and is currently summarizing work experience.
    Another dispatch: The Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau is making intensive preparations for this year's large-scale basic construction tasks.
    The Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau's drilling tasks this year are double those of last year. In order to complete this arduous task, the bureau is actively preparing to establish basic construction organizations. Factories and mines that did not have basic construction management organizations in the past are now establishing specialized organizations. Drilling, construction, and other construction units are also preparing to establish various professional organizations. A large number of drilling rigs, seismographs, gravimeters, and other machinery and equipment will also be transported one after another.
    A large number of basic construction cadres in the petroleum industry have been added. The personnel department transferred 92 veteran cadres to the bureau, who will be assigned to basic construction departments to take on various leadership roles. Of the 350 university, college, and vocational school graduates who were transferred to work at the bureau last year, more than 80 percent were assigned to basic construction aspects, cultivated to become skilled basic construction technical personnel. In addition, 131 workers were transferred from production departments to basic construction positions to take on management work. Tens of thousands of personnel are also interning in drilling technology, machine assembly, and as automobile drivers, preparing to meet the larger-scale petroleum construction tasks. In addition, in order to reserve strength, the Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau attaches importance to formal technical education. In 1951, the Northwest Petroleum Industry School was established in Xi'an, with 530 students, specializing in training talents in petroleum drilling, oil extraction, and statistics. Two classes of students will graduate this summer and take up work positions. In 1952, the Gansu Shandan Bailie School was also used to specifically train petroleum technical talents.
    In order to discover new oilfields, strengthening geological exploration has become one of the current important tasks of the bureau. Various geological exploration work teams have been greatly expanded. Among them, the number of geological work teams has increased by six, gravity work teams by three, and seismic work teams and surveying work teams have each increased by two. In order to improve the technical level of incumbent geological personnel and learn from advanced Soviet experience, the bureau has transferred a group of cadres to Beijing to participate in study since November of last year. Under the personal guidance of Soviet experts, they are summarizing the geological work of the past year and learning geological theory. The bureau has also transferred some incumbent cadres to visit major factories and mines in the Northeast.

    中央燃料工业部石油管理总局
    集中勘探工作人员两批到京进行学习
    西北石油管理局用大力充实基本建设的力量
    中央人民政府燃料工业部石油管理总局，根据全国第一次石油会议决定的方针，三年来在西北重点进行了石油勘探地质工作。该局勘探人员在陕北、河西做了许多新地区的调查及原有“构造”的复查工作，也在若干地区钻了许多不同深度的探井，获得了许多地面的、地下的、地球物理的资料和经验。
    为了总结三年来的野外工作，学习苏联先进经验，推广典型，提高野外工作同志的政治思想和业务水平，以便更好地迎接祖国大规模经济建设，该局决定集中野外工作同志分两批调至北京学习。第一期已于去年十一月开学，现正总结工作经验。
    又讯：西北石油管理局为了迎接今年的大规模基本建设任务，正紧张地进行各项准备工作。
    西北石油管理局今年的钻探任务，比去年大了一倍。该局为了完成这一繁重艰巨的任务，积极筹备成立基本建设机构。过去没有管理基本建设机构的厂矿，正在成立专责机构。钻井、建筑等施工单位，也筹备建立各种专业机构。大批的钻机、地震仪、重力仪和其他机械设备，也将陆续运到。
    石油工业基本建设干部，已大量增加。人事部门给该局调来九十二位老干部，将分配在基本建设部门，担任各种领导工作；去年调来该局工作的大学、专科、职业学校毕业的学生，共三百五十名，其中百分之八十以上，都分配到基本建设方面，培养为熟练的基本建设技术人材；并从生产部门抽调了一百三十一名工人，到基本建设岗位上，担任管理工作；又有上万的人员，分别实习钻井技术、机器装建、汽车司机，准备迎接更大规模的石油建设任务。此外，为了储备力量，西北石油管理局重视了正规的技术教育。一九五一年，在西安设立了西北石油工业学校，现有学生五百三十人，专门训练石油钻井、采油、统计各方面的人材。今年夏天将有两班学生毕业，走上工作岗位。一九五二年，又以甘肃山丹培黎学校，专门训练石油技术人材。
    为了发现新的油田，加强地质勘探工作已成为目前该局重要工作之一。各种地质勘探工作队，都大大扩充了。其中地质工作队增加了六队，重力工作队增加了三队，地震工作队、测量工作队各增加了两队。为了提高在职地质人员的技术水平，学习苏联先进经验，该局自去年十一月，即抽调了一批干部，到北京参加学习，在苏联专家亲自指导下，一面总结一年来的地质工作，一面学习地质理论。该局并已抽调一部分在职干部，赴东北各大厂矿参观。
