The representatives of the Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, headed by Chairman Soong Ching Ling, attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. In his welcoming speech, he expressed a warm welcome and gratitude to the representatives of the Chinese delegation, thanking them for gloriously completing the task entrusted by the Chinese people.

Chairman Soong Ching Ling then spoke, pointing out that the Chinese delegation to the World People's Peace Congress had completed the task entrusted to them by the Chinese people. Now that the representatives have returned to China one after another, the future work of the delegation is to convey the spirit and resolutions of the Vienna Congress to the people of the whole country. She expressed that the Chinese representatives will work together with the people of the whole country to further devote themselves to the cause of peace. She firmly believes that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will surely complete the task of construction and make continuous and significant contributions to defending world peace. She finally shouted, "Long live peace!"

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation, reported on the achievements of the World People's Peace Congress. He first described the immense scale of the preparations for the congress by people from all countries and the breadth of the congress. He said: The World Peace Council's special meeting in Berlin initiated the call for the World People's Peace Congress, which was enthusiastically supported by the people of all countries. The people of the world conducted extensive and in-depth preparatory work. The support of the people of the world enabled the congress to open victoriously and on schedule. More than 1,800 representatives, alternate representatives, and guests from 85 countries and various international organizations participated in the congress, including people from various social strata and with various political views and religious beliefs.

Guo Moruo said: During the eight days of the meeting, the representatives conducted free, democratic, and extensive discussions on the three topics of national independence and international security, cessation of ongoing wars, and international tensions. They formulated two important documents of the congress and, as appendices to the congress's resolutions, the suggestions put forward by the three subcommittees of the congress, proposed a program of action for the future peace movement. All the official representatives unanimously voted in favor of the two important documents of the congress.

Guo Moruo then pointed out that the three great achievements of the congress were: (1) Expanding the broad base of the peace movement: During the preparation of the congress, the peace movement was carried out in depth and extensively among the broad masses. Among those who participated in the congress, there were people from all walks of life with various political views and religious beliefs, of whom about 400 had not previously participated in the peace movement. (2) Further exposing the deceptive propaganda of the warmongers, pointing out that the root cause of the current international tensions is the war and aggression policy of the United States. The broad representation of the congress and the democracy, breadth, and freedom in the discussions bankrupted the slanderous propaganda of the warmongers against the peace movement. (3) Formulating a common program of action for the current peace movement: The declaration of the World People's Peace Congress put forward nine demands, including the demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, the demand to stop the ongoing wars, and the demand to ban bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and a committee composed of representatives from various countries was formed to send a letter from the World People's Peace Congress to the governments of the five major powers.

Guo Moruo finally said: Under the leadership of Chairman Soong Ching Ling, the Chinese delegation expressed the Chinese people's desire for peace, promoted the unity of the congress, and widely publicized the Chinese people's peaceful will and achievements in peaceful construction. The three speeches of the Chinese representatives were warmly welcomed by the congress. The congress demonstrated the will of the people of the world to demand peace and oppose war, so the peace movement will have great development after the congress. The Chinese people not only have the responsibility to implement the resolutions of the congress, but also to further unite the people of all countries to implement the resolutions of the congress. Resolutely continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, ensure the completion of national construction tasks, and convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, which will become a guarantee for achieving peace in Asia and the world.

Peng Zhen, in his speech during the discussion, pointed out: The World People's Peace Congress summarized the experience of the peace movement, grasped the central issues in the current peace movement, and proposed a program of action for the future. The broad representation of the congress and the enthusiasm of the representatives show the increasing awareness of the people of all countries and the rising sentiment against the U.S. war policy. The great achievements of the World People's Peace Congress will greatly promote the world peace movement and bring the peace movement into a new stage.

After a heated discussion, the meeting unanimously passed the resolution of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace on supporting the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress amid warm applause.

The Chinese representatives who attended the World People's Peace Congress will return to their respective regions in the coming days to widely convey the achievements of the World People's Peace Congress to the Chinese people, calling on the Chinese people to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, ensure the completion of the national construction plan, and convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, in order to implement the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress.
