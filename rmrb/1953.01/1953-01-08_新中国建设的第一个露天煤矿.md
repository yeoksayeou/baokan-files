The First Open-Pit Coal Mine Built in New China
Song Cheng

Here is an open-pit coal mine, more than three kilometers long, six hundred meters wide, and more than twenty meters deep. On the construction site, various electrified, powerful machines are excavating the soil above the coal seam and transporting it to a spoil heap ten kilometers away. This is the first large open-pit mine built by the Chinese people themselves after the founding of New China – the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau. Beneath this mine pit lies a coal seam more than sixty meters thick, as high as a ten-story building. Now, at the eastern end of the mine pit, the black, shiny coal seam has already begun to emerge. Two years from now, when the open-pit mine reaches its designed output, many of China's newly built factories and power stations will be able to obtain abundant fuel from here. The output of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine is so huge that if the coal produced in one year were used for power generation, it could generate 4.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. With this electricity, 12.9 billion meters of cloth could be woven each year. If the coal produced in one year were used to power railway locomotives, it could supply 540 locomotives to complete 20 billion ton-kilometers of transportation annually.

Highly Mechanized Labor Process, Automated Transportation Command

To build this open-pit mine, the flat land here needs to be dug into a deep valley, and the excavated soil transported ten kilometers away. The depression between two mountains needs to be filled into a plain. The amount of soil and rock excavated from here will be 560 million cubic meters, equivalent to the total excavation volume of five Suez Canals and one Panama Canal. In the future, the mine pit will deepen layer by layer like steps, down to a depth of 350 meters. The width of the mine pit will also expand to one and a half kilometers. To transport the topsoil and coal, nearly 300 kilometers of railway will be laid in the mine pit and on the spoil heap. To date, the depth and overburden removal volume of open-pit coal mines in the world have not exceeded the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine. The people building the open-pit mine are proud to work on this mine.

However, here you will not see hundreds or thousands of people. Various most modern machines have already replaced manual labor in the main production process. The Soviet-style, crawler-mounted large electric shovels, weighing 150 tons, continuously swing their heads with necks over ten meters long, gnawing at the topsoil in the mine pit, taking three cubic meters in one bite and dumping it into the carriages. One cycle of swallowing and spitting takes only twenty-seven or eight seconds. The electric shovel's highest efficiency has reached 5,400 cubic meters of overburden removal per day, which means that one electric shovel is equivalent to the manual labor of eight hundred and thirty-forty workers. After the electric shovel fills a train (eleven or twelve carriages), the electric locomotive pulls them to the spoil heap. On the spoil heap, the spoil disposal workers only need to press a switch on the carriage, and more than ten carriages will simultaneously turn sideways, automatically opening one side to dump the soil. After the spoil disposal workers clean the soil attached to the bottom of the carriage, the train drives back to the mine pit again. Therefore, in such a large mine pit, you can only see a few signal workers, line maintenance workers, and drilling workers. And much of their current work will gradually be replaced by machinery.

Building open-pit coal mines is the most ideal method of coal mining, and this can only be done in areas where the coal seam is very thick and close to the surface. In many cases, due to the thinness of the coal seam, the method of digging vertical or inclined shafts is mostly used for coal mining. Mining in underground mines hundreds of meters deep can be imagined to be much more difficult and complex than in open-pit mines. In the mine below, it is necessary to develop longitudinal and transverse roadways and many working faces according to the distribution of coal seams. Many coal seams contain gas, which often explodes. The air in the roadways and working faces is very thin and the temperature is extremely high. In order to prevent gas explosions and provide miners with enough fresh air, there must be a complete and complex ventilation system underground. Water continuously涌s out of the rocks and coal seams underground, so there must also be drainage equipment such as pumps and water tanks. When miners mine coal at the working face, the support workers must closely follow the advancement of the working face and support the working face with many wooden pillars or stone piles to prevent the roof from collapsing; on the mined-out working faces, the filling workers let the roof collapse and fill the mined-out area to reduce the pressure on the roof of the working face. If these tasks are not coordinated well, or not done to specifications, accidents can occur. Transporting the mined coal out of the mine is also a very complex task. At the same time, in vertical or inclined shafts, some coal pillars must be left on the working face to support the roof, especially in thick coal seams, and coal seams must be used to fill the mined-out space. This coal cannot be mined. These situations do not occur in open-pit mines.

The future of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine is an even more beautiful picture. When the construction project is completed, the slopes around the mine pit will be built into neat slopes, which will be covered with green grass. Rows of trees will be planted around the mine pit above the slopes. These miners, who manufacture grain for factories and transmit light and warmth to people, will not only be free from the threat of various accidents, but also be able to work in the embrace of sunshine, green forests and grass. In the open-pit mine, coal mining work, like the current overburden removal work, can be done with an electric shovel digging three cubic meters (equivalent to 5.4 tons) of coal in one scoop. The electric locomotive pulls the carriages that can automatically unload coal, transporting cars full of coal to the ground. In the future, when production begins, the overall efficiency of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine will be four to five times higher than the efficiency of underground coal mining.

The high degree of mechanization of the labor process and the automation of transportation command enable the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine to adopt the most scientific, simple and highly centralized management methods in the future. The employees of the open-pit mine love to talk about their future joint building. In the future, the mine manager of the open-pit mine will be able to directly understand the production and transportation situation by using various automatic devices in the building. The heads of each mining section and the dispatchers will also use various electrified automatic devices to guide the on-site work in a timely manner. Not only will all management work be concentrated in the building, but the employees' locker rooms and bathrooms will also be located in the building. Every day when employees go to work, they first gather in the meeting room in the building to assign tasks, listen to the mine manager and the heads of each mining section assign the tasks for the day, and then change clothes and take the attendance car to the pit to work. After work is completed, they take the car to the building to shower and change clothes, ending a day's work.

Fully Demonstrates the Superiority of Socialist Technology

Before the development of this open-pit mine, the Fuxin Mining Bureau had repeatedly transferred employees to the Fushun Open-Pit Mine to study. At that time, they dreamed of when our open-pit mine would be like Fushun, with electric shovels and electric locomotives whirring and cars of coal being transported out. At that time, the Fushun Open-Pit Mine was the highest ideal for the employees here. In early 1951, the latest Soviet-style electric shovels, electric locomotives, self-tipping trucks, etc., that we ordered from the Soviet Union arrived one after another. In the summer of 1952, Soviet experts led by Comrade Kaulanov brought us the design of the open-pit mine. The most advanced socialist design and the most modern mechanical equipment made the employees' ideals greatly surpass the Fushun Open-Pit Mine designed by Japanese imperialism during the pseudo-Manchu period.

The scale of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine is much larger than that of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine, with a mine pit that is seven kilometers long; the coal seam is also much thicker than that of Fuxin, with an average thickness of about eighty meters. However, the output of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine is smaller than that of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine, and the number of employees in the Fushun Open-Pit Mine is about five times that of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine. The reason is that the Fushun Open-Pit Mine was designed according to Japan's backward technological level, while the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine was designed according to the Soviet Union's advanced technological level. Due to the backward design layout of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine, the large carts for overburden removal cannot reach the depths of the mine pit, so coal mining can only be done with small electric shovels, and coal transportation can only be done with two large winches carrying buckets, which limits the mine pit's production capacity. In addition, the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine will realize the full mechanization and partial automation of the production process, except for extremely light and trivial labor that is difficult to replace with machinery. Although the Fushun Open-Pit Mine is a world-renowned and fairly highly mechanized mine, there is still a lot of work done manually. For example, on the various mining sections and spoil heaps of the open-pit mine, the railways and transmission lines have to be moved frequently as the mining and spoil disposal progress. In Fushun, this part of the work is done entirely manually. In the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine, from this year onwards, track shifting, track leveling, and backfilling will all be mechanized.

The advanced nature of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine is not only reflected in its higher degree of mechanization than Fushun. The railway line design of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine more fully demonstrates the superiority of socialist technology. In the design of an open-pit mine, rationally and scientifically laying out the lines is one of the most complex and difficult problems to solve. Taking the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine as an example, nearly 300 kilometers of railway must be laid on the sixteen mining sections in the mine pit and in the five-story spoil heap, 90 meters high, 3 kilometers wide, and 3.7 kilometers long, ten kilometers away. In such a situation with small intervals, steep slopes, and short diameters, the number of vehicle passages is extremely frequent. Therefore, whether transportation efficiency can be guaranteed is one of the main indicators of whether the open-pit mine design is rational and economical. According to the design of Japanese imperialism in Fushun, empty and loaded vehicles constantly intersect and conflict on the lines, requiring frequent passing, resulting in low transportation efficiency and difficult command. The Fuxin Open-Pit Mine, according to the Soviet design, adopts a cyclical reverse wiring method. Empty and loaded vehicles can each take a road without conflicting with each other and without needing to pass. The cyclical reverse wiring method, coupled with automated transportation command work, will enable the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine to guarantee a high degree of line traffic capacity and locomotive utilization. Soviet design experts not only considered the construction and production of the open-pit mine, but also considered what would be left to our descendants when mining is completed decades later. They designed the spoil heap with yellow soil on top and rocks below. Decades later, after the coal seam of the open-pit mine has been mined, the mine pit will stop draining and can be turned into a lake, and the spoil heap will be turned into a yellow soil plain, which can be immediately used to plant crops and build parks.

The Construction Process is a Process of Learning from the Soviet Union

There is also something that surprised me at the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine. That is, in such a large-scale and technically complex project, there is not a single technician who has specially studied the technology of developing open-pit mines. Almost all of the technicians here are young students who have been gradually transferred from production and have just graduated from universities or technical schools with degrees in civil engineering or electrical engineering. The stripping section in charge of all construction management work has three deputy section chiefs, two of whom are from worker backgrounds, one was originally a train driver and the other was an electrical worker; the other is a student who recently graduated from Lingnan University with a degree in civil engineering. What is the situation of the workers? In the winter of 1949, the Fuxin Mining Bureau recruited and transferred hundreds of young workers with a certain level of education from production and sent them to the Fushun Open-Pit Mine to study. At that time, many of these workers did not even know what an electric shovel was. Now they have become the backbone of the construction project and have begun to train apprentices in batches. At the beginning of the project, everyone encountered many difficulties and took some detours: the project was often reworked; the transportation efficiency was low, and the stripping progress was not fast; the electric shovel did not dig full of soil, and it was scattered all over the ground when loading; the new Soviet machinery came, and everyone did not know how to use it... However, these difficulties did not scare the employees of the open-pit mine. For them, the process of work is the process of learning. After the summer of last year, the rework situation was greatly reduced, and the stripping volume of the electric shovel increased day by day. After the successful trial of fixed-point operations in September (that is, the implementation of rhythmic operations according to the instruction chart in stripping and transportation), the daily stripping volume surged from an average of 18,000 cubic meters to more than 30,000 cubic meters. How did they overcome difficulties and achieve such good results? Many people gave me the same answer: "Learn from experts,"
"If there is a problem, everyone figures it out together, and everyone's opinions combined are the engineer."

The fact is indeed the case. The construction process of the open-pit mine is a process of learning from the Soviet Union. The design of the open-pit mine was commissioned by our country to the Soviet National Design Institute. The construction of the open-pit mine was carried out with the direct help of Soviet experts such as Comrade Gribkov. When the Soviet machinery came, the Soviet experts did not hesitate to work hard and were not afraid of oil stains, and spent all day in the locomotive teaching workers how to operate it. The comrades of the open-pit mine were deeply moved by the Soviet experts' spirit of tireless teaching. Soviet experts also praised the wisdom and efforts of the employees of the open-pit mine. When I visited Comrade Gribkov, he said with satisfaction that in the past two years, he personally saw these young technicians and skilled workers go from not understanding to understanding, from not knowing to knowing, from laymen to gradually becoming experts, and also trained a group of skilled workers to operate the new machinery, so he confidently told me that this project can definitely be completed according to plan. Of course, to complete this project and manage the production of this mine, employees must conduct more arduous study.

Concentrating the wisdom of the masses is the source of strength. The employees here have personally experienced this. Many technical problems have been solved after discussing them with comrades from relevant units. In the past, making plans without consulting with the on-site personnel resulted in rework every two or three days; launching "fixed-point operations" without mobilizing the masses failed to get on track for a long time. After learning the lessons and following the mass line, the rework phenomenon was greatly reduced, and "fixed-point operations" were also successful. Concentrating the wisdom of the masses is not only understood by cadres and technicians, but also learned by outstanding workers. When the young model electric shovel driver Liu Huiwen saw the newspaper introducing the Guo Valiaof work method, he started thinking, mobilized the nine drivers of his three shifts, learned from each other's strengths, and summarized a set of advanced operating methods, creating a new record of loading a train in thirty-five minutes.

Now, the employees of the open-pit mine have overfulfilled the 1952 national plan. This year, on the birthday of the Party, the construction of the open-pit mine (excluding surface buildings) will be completed and will begin to enter the production period. By 1955, it will be able to reach the designed output and produce a large amount of coal. (Attached pictures)

    新中国建设的第一个露天煤矿
    宋琤
    这里是一个三公里多长、六百多公尺宽、二十多公尺深的一个露天煤矿。在工地上，各种电气化的能力巨大的机械正在挖掘煤层上面的土壤，并把它们运送到十公里以外的排土场去。这就是新中国成立以后，中国人民自己建设的第一个大露天矿——阜新矿务局的阜新露天煤矿。这个矿坑下面，埋藏着像十几层楼房那样高的六十多公尺厚的煤层。现在，矿坑的东端，乌油发亮的煤层已经露出头来。两年以后，当露天矿达到设计产量时，我国许许多多新建的工厂和电站，都可从这里得到丰富的燃料。阜新露天矿的产量是如此巨大，假使把它
    一年所产的煤用于发电，每年可以发出四十三亿度电，用这些电力，每年可以织出一百二十九亿公尺布；把一年生产的煤用来开动火车机车，可供五百四十台机车一年完成二百亿吨公里运输之用。
    劳动过程高度机械化，运输指挥工作自动化
    要建设这座露天矿，需要把这里的平地挖成深谷，挖出的土运到十公里以外，要把两座山间的凹地填成平原，从这里挖出的土和石头将要有五亿六千万立方公尺，等于开凿五个苏彝士运河和一个巴拿马运河的挖土量的总和。将来矿坑就要像台阶一样一层层地深下去，直到三百五十公尺深。矿坑的宽度也要扩展到一公里半。为了运送表土和煤，在矿坑里和排土场上要铺设将近三百公里的铁路。到现在为止，世界上露天煤矿的深度和剥土量还没有超过阜新露天矿的。建设露天矿的人们都为在这个矿上工作而自豪。
    但是，在这里你却看不到成百上千的人群。各种最现代化的机械已经代替了主要生产过程中的体力劳动。苏联式的带着履带的体重一百五十吨的大电铲不停地摆动着有着十几公尺长的长脖子的脑袋，啃啮着矿坑里的表土，一口就是三立方公尺，并把它倾倒在车厢里。而一吞一吐只要二十七八秒钟。电铲的最高效率曾经到每天剥土五千四百立方公尺，就是说，一个电铲相等于八百三四十个工人的体力劳动。电铲把一列（十一二辆）车厢都装满了，电动机车就把它们拖到排土场上。在排土场上，排土工人只须把车上的开关一按，十多个车厢就一齐侧翻身来，自动地张开一面，把土倾倒出来。排土工人把附着在车厢底下的土清扫一下，车子就又开回矿坑去了。因而，在这么大的矿坑里，你只能看到寥寥无几的信号工、线路维修工和打钻的工人。而他们目前的工作也有许多将要逐渐被机械代替了。
    修建露天矿采煤，是一种最理想的采煤方法，而这只有在煤层很厚并距地面较近的地区才能进行。在很多的情况下，由于煤层较薄，大都是采用开凿竖井或斜井的办法来采煤。在几百公尺深的井下采煤，可以设想要比露天矿困难复杂得多。在矿井下面，要根据煤层的分布状况开拓出纵横的巷道，和许许多多的工作面。许多煤层里都含有瓦斯，瓦斯常常会爆炸，巷道和工作面上的空气又非常稀薄，温度极高。为了防止瓦斯爆炸并给矿工们以足够的新鲜空气，在井下须要有一套完善的复杂的通风装置。井下的岩石和煤层中不断涌出水来，因而，还必须有水泵、水仓等排水装备。矿工们在工作面上采煤，支柱工人们须要紧跟着工作面的推进，用许许多多的木柱或石垛支撑起工作面，以免顶板塌落；已采空的工作面上，则由充填工人们把顶板塌落下来，把这采空的地区填充起来，以减少工作面上的顶板的压力。这些工作配合得不好，或者做得不合规格，就会造成事故。把采下的煤运出矿坑，也是一件十分复杂的事情。同时，在竖井或斜井中，由于在工作面上还要留一些煤柱子支撑顶板，特别是在厚煤中，还要用煤层来填充已采的空间，这些煤是无法采出的。这些情况，在露天矿中都不会发生。
    阜新露天矿的将来，更是一幅美丽的图画。在建设工程完了时，矿坑周围的边坡将要修筑出整整齐齐的斜坡，上面要满铺青草，边坡上面将环绕矿坑成排地栽种林木，这些为工厂制造粮食为人们输送光明和温暖的矿工们，不但免除了各种事故的威胁，而且可以在阳光普照、绿林青草的环抱中从事劳动了。在露天矿，采煤的工作和现在的剥土工作一样，电铲挖一下，就是三立方公尺（合五吨四）煤。电动机车牵引着能够自动卸煤的车厢，把满车满车的煤炭运送到地面上。将来，在开始生产时，阜新露天矿的全员效率将要比在井下挖煤的效率高四至五倍。
    劳动过程的高度机械化和运输指挥工作的自动化，使阜新露天矿将来能够采用最科学的，层次简单的高度集中的管理方法。露天矿的职工们最爱谈他们将来的联合大楼。将来，露天矿的矿长在大楼里，运用各种自动装置，就能直接了解生产和运输情况。各采掘段长以及调度人员也都利用各种电气化的自动装置及时指导现场工作。不但全部管理工作集中在大楼里进行，职工们的更衣室、浴室，也都设在大楼内。职工们每天上班时，首先集中在大楼的分配任务的会议室里，听候矿长和各采掘段长分配当天任务，而后更衣乘出勤车下坑工作。工作完毕后，乘车上坑到大楼内洗澡换衣，结束一天的劳动。
    充分表现了社会主义技术的优越性
    在这个露天矿开发以前，阜新矿务局曾经数次抽调职工到抚顺露天矿去学习。那时，他们作梦也在想：什么时候我们的露天矿才能像抚顺那样，电铲、电机车呜呜叫，成车成车地往外出煤呢？当时，抚顺露天矿就是这里职工们的最高的理想。一九五一年初，我们在苏联订购的最新式的电铲、电机车、自翻车等等陆续来到了。一九五二年夏天，以考然诺夫为首的苏联专家们带来了代我们做的露天矿的设计。社会主义的最先进的设计和最近代化的机械设备，使职工们的理想大大地跨越过了伪满时日本帝国主义设计的抚顺露天矿。
    抚顺露天矿的规模比阜新露天矿大得多，矿坑长达七公里；煤层也比阜新厚得多，平均厚度在八十公尺左右。但是，抚顺露天矿的产量却比阜新露天矿小，抚顺露天矿的职工也多于阜新露天矿五倍左右。原因就在于抚顺露天矿是根据日本的落后的技术水平设计的，而阜新露天矿则是根据苏联先进技术水平设计的。由于抚顺露天矿设计布局的落后，剥土用的大车皮不能到达矿坑深处，因而采煤只能用小电铲，运煤只能用两个带着箕斗的大卷扬机，以致使矿坑的生产能力受到限制。另外，阜新露天矿除了极轻微零碎不好用机械代替的劳动外，将要实现生产过程的全部机械化和部分自动化。抚顺露天矿虽然是世界闻名的相当高度机械化的矿山，但是还有不少工作是用人力来做的。例如，在露天矿的各个采掘段和排土场上，铁道和输电线路要随着采掘和排土的进度而频繁地移动。在抚顺这一部分工作是完全用人工的。在阜新露天矿今年起移道、平道、填土就全部机械化了。
    阜新露天矿的先进还不仅表现在它比抚顺更高度的机械化方面。阜新露天矿铁道线路的设计更充分的表现出社会主义技术的优越。在露天矿的设计中，合理地科学地铺设线路是一个最复杂最难解决的问题。就以阜新露天矿来看，在矿坑的十六层采掘段上，和十公里以外的九十公尺高，三公里宽、三公里七长的上下五层的排土场中，要铺设将近三百公里的铁道。在这样区间小、坡度大、直径短的情况下，车辆的通过次数又极为频繁。因而，能否保证运输效率便是露天矿设计是否合理、经济的主要标志之一。根据日本帝国主义在抚顺的设计，空车和重车在线路上不断交错冲突，需要经常错车，运输效率很低，指挥也困难。阜新露天矿根据苏联设计，采用了循环折返式的配线方法。空车重车可以各走一条道路，互不冲突，不用错车。循环折返式的配线方法加上自动化的运输指挥工作，将使阜新露天矿能够保证高度的线路通车能力和机车利用率。苏联设计专家不但考虑露天矿的建设和生产，还要考虑到数十年后开采完毕时遗留给我们的子孙的是什么。他们设计的排土场是上面排黄土，下面排岩石。数十年后，露天矿煤层开采完毕后，矿坑里停止排水，可以变成一个湖泊，排土场则变成一个黄土平原，马上可以种庄稼修公园。
    建设过程就是向苏联学习的过程
    在阜新露天矿，还有一件使我惊讶的事情。就是在这样一个规模浩大技术复杂的工程中，没有一个专门学过开发露天矿的技术人员。这里的技术人员几乎全部是陆续地从生产中抽调出来的、刚从大学或专科学校毕业的学土木建筑或电气的年轻学生。负责全部施工管理工作的剥离科有三位副科长，其中两位是工人出身，一个原是火车司机，一个是电气工人；另一个是曾在岭南大学学土木结构的毕业不久的学生。工人的情况如何呢？一九四九年冬阜新矿务局招募和从生产中抽调了几百名年轻的有一定文化程度的工人，把他们送到抚顺露天矿学习。那时，这一批工人中很多人连电铲是什么也不知道，现在他们成了建设工程中的骨干，并且已经开始一批批地带徒弟了。工程开始时，大家也曾遇到不少困难，走过一些弯路：工程常常返工；运输效率低，剥离进度不快；电铲挖不满土，装车时还洒得满地都是；苏联的新机械来了，大家不会使用……。但是，这些困难都没有吓倒露天矿的职工们。对于他们，工作的过程就是学习的过程。去年夏季以后，返工的情况大大减少了，电铲的剥离量一天天提高。九月份定点作业（即在剥离和运输工作中实行按指示图表有节奏的作业）试验成功后，每日的剥离量由平均一万八千立方公尺激增到三万立方公尺以上。他们是怎样克服困难取得这样良好的成绩呢？好多人给我的答案是一样的：“向专家学习”，
    “有问题大家一块合计，大家的意见集中起来就是工程师”。
    事实的确如此，露天矿的建设过程就是向苏联学习的过程。露天矿的设计是苏联国家设计院接受我国的委托代我国做的。露天矿的建设是在苏联专家格立布可夫同志等的直接帮助下进行的。苏联的机械来了，苏联专家们又不辞劳苦不怕油垢，成天钻在机车里教工人操纵。露天矿的同志们都深深为苏联专家的诲人不倦的精神所感动。苏联专家也很赞许露天矿职工们的智慧和努力。当我访问格立布可夫同志时，他很满意地说，这一两年中他亲自看到，这些年青的技术人员和技工由不懂到懂，由不会到会，由外行逐渐地变为内行，而且还培养出一批熟练的工人来操纵新的机械，所以，他很有信心地告诉我，这个工程一定可以按计划完成。自然，要完成这个工程，要管理这个矿的生产，职工们还必须进行更坚苦的学习。
    集中群众的智慧就是力量的源泉，这里的职工们都亲身体验到了这一点。许多技术上的疑难问题，经过和有关单位的同志一块商量，都得到解决。过去做计划不和现场商量，结果是三天两头返工；搞
    “定点作业”没有发动群众，很久还上不了轨道。接受了教训，走了群众路线后，返工现象大大减少了，“定点作业”也搞成功了。集中群众的智慧，不但干部技术人员懂得这样做，优秀的工人们同样学会了这一点。年轻的模范电铲司机刘会文看到报纸上介绍郭瓦廖夫工作方法，他就开动脑筋，发动自己三班的九个司机，取长补短，互相学习，总结出一套先进的操作方法，创造出三十五分钟装一列车的新纪录。
                    ×××
    现在，露天矿的职工们已经超额完成了一九五二年的国家计划，今年，党的生日时，露天矿的建设
    （地面建筑除外）就要结束了，开始进入生产时期。到一九五五年，就可以达到设计产量大量出煤了。（附图片）
