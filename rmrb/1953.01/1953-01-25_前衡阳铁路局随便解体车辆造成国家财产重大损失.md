    Former Hengyang Railway Bureau Randomly Dismantled Vehicles, Causing Major Losses to State Property

    To the Editor: The former Hengyang Railway Bureau's Surplus Materials Handling Committee irresponsibly dismantled vehicles, causing major losses to state property.

    In early November of last year, the former Hengyang Railway Bureau's Surplus Materials Handling Committee instructed its subordinate Guilin Materials Branch to dismantle a batch of damaged vehicles stored at Jiuhuashan in Guilin and sell them as scrap steel, in order to remit the money to the national treasury as funds for national construction. It should be said that this instruction itself was correct, but errors occurred in the specific implementation. According to the Ministry of Railways' regulations, a vehicle dismantling report must be filled out in advance for vehicle dismantling; however, they did not instruct the Guilin Materials Branch to fill it out. When the Guilin Materials Branch encountered doubts in carrying out the task and asked which vehicles should be dismantled and which should not, they did not inquire about the vehicle numbers or the condition of the vehicle bodies, but decisively replied over the phone: "They can be dismantled." As a result, three vehicles that should not have been dismantled were also dismantled. At a time when the country is embarking on large-scale economic construction and there is a shortage of vehicles, this is a major and irreparable loss!

    After the accident, the Materials Section of the former Hengyang Railway Bureau sent someone to Guilin to investigate, and made a detailed written report upon their return. Logically, this incident should have attracted the attention of the Bureau, which should have seriously investigated the responsibility and dealt with it severely to avoid similar incidents from happening again. However, the reality was not like this. On the contrary, they wanted to cover it up. Their负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) even said nonchalantly: "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter even if it's reported to the Ministry of Railways, just find a way to find three others to replace them." They are so "generous" with the property of the state and the people, which is absolutely intolerable!

    I believe that the former Hengyang Railway Bureau should make a public self-criticism in the newspaper about this.　A reader

### 前衡阳铁路局随便解体车辆造成国家财产重大损失

    前衡阳铁路局随便解体车辆造成国家财产重大损失
    编辑同志：前衡阳铁路管理局多余物资处理委员会不负责任地解体车辆，造成国家财产的重大损失。
    去年十一月初，前衡阳铁路管理局多余物资处理委员会曾指示所属桂林材料支厂，把存在桂林九华山的一批残破车辆解体，当作废钢铁出售，以便把这些钱上缴国库，作为国家建设的资金。应该说，这一指示的本身是正确的，但在具体执行中却发生了错误。按照铁道部的规定，车辆解体一定要事先填报车辆解体报告书；但他们并没有指示桂林材料支厂填写。当桂林材料支厂在执行任务发生疑问，请示哪些车应该解体、哪些车不应该解体时，他们也不查问车号及车体残破状态，便断然地在电话里答复说：“可以解体。”以致把不应该解体的三辆车辆也都给解体了。在国家大规模经济建设开始，车辆不够使用的情况下，这该是多么重大而又难以弥补的损失！
    事故发生后，前衡阳铁路管理局材料处曾派人到桂林去了解，回来后并作了详细的书面报告。照理，这一事件应该引起管理局的重视，认真查究责任并严肃处理，以避免类似事件的发生。但是事实并不是这样，相反地他们想隐瞒下去。他们的负责人还若无其事地说：“不要紧，报到铁道部去了也不要紧，只要想法子去另外找三辆顶替就行了。”他们对待国家人民的财产是这样“大方”，这该是多么令人难以容忍的事！
    我认为前衡阳铁路管理局对此应该在报上公开检讨。　一读者
