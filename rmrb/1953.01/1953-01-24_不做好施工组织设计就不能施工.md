Construction Must Not Begin Without a Proper Construction Organization Design
    Shen Guanghan

In the 1953 construction preparation work, formulating a construction organization design should be listed as the most important task.

Experience over the past few years has proven that thorough and meticulous preparation can guarantee the speed and quality of construction and reduce project costs. In the past three years, countless advanced experiences have emerged on the basic construction front, fundamentally reforming construction methods and developing towards construction mechanization and factory production. Furthermore, the projects we will be building in the future are complex, large-scale, and modern enterprises. These two factors determine that we can no longer blindly construct using outdated and obsolete methods. The entire construction organization must have scientific and highly planned characteristics and must be fully prepared for all construction work. Otherwise, it will delay the speed of construction. Based on these requirements, emphasizing that construction is not allowed without a proper construction organization design is entirely necessary.

A construction organization design should include: the construction sequence, annual workload schedule, construction master plan, calculation of locally available building materials, design of temporary buildings, provision of temporary roads, water, and electricity, the required number of construction machinery and tools, design of temporary construction workshops, the required number of employees, and the ratio of job types. In the past, many people did not understand the importance of this work and often started construction without a construction design, resulting in many problems. For example, materials were piled on top of the foundation, transportation routes were built over pipelines, and temporary buildings occupied transportation roads. ...In short, the losses caused to the country due to the lack of construction organization design are staggering. In 1952, the 37 dormitory projects of the Harbin Fourth Engineering Bureau dug heating trenches after the buildings were completed. By this time, the climate was winter, with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius, and 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork had become frozen soil. Originally, one worker could dig four cubic meters per day, but now it took three people a whole day to dig one cubic meter, increasing the cost twelvefold and affecting the construction period. On the other hand, last year's facts also showed that units that valued construction organization design experienced smoother construction progress. Anshan Iron and Steel Company paid attention to construction organization design in the construction of the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant projects and established a construction design section on the construction site, specializing in construction design for technically complex projects, resulting in great achievements. For example, the equipment foundations of these two major projects required high quality, and the permissible deviation of the center lines of the foundation screws was very strict. Such precise work was difficult in terms of installation technology. However, due to the construction design of fixed frames, more than 10,000 anchor bolts have been successfully installed, all meeting quality standards.

What exactly does a construction organization design include? Based on general construction processes and experience, after accepting the task and studying the drawings, the project site should comprehensively study the following issues and prepare a construction organization design.

First, determine the construction sequence. Determining the construction sequence is the key to whether the entire construction task can be completed in an orderly and planned manner. Therefore, it is necessary to rationally decide which project to do first and which to do later, and which part of the project to do first and which to do later, based on production requirements and project nature. This involves "project queuing" and compiling an annual project workload schedule. Planning the entire construction steps before the official start of construction can balance the implementation of the construction plan, balance the supply of manpower and materials, and overcome the past construction process of "being idle at the beginning and rushing work in the second half," in order to concentrate manpower and materials on the projects that start first.

Second, study construction methods. After determining the construction sequence, it is necessary to study what technical measures and construction methods to take to complete it. For example, adopting the parallel and continuous operation construction method requires not only coordination of the entire project layout, but also research on how to divide sections and other technical measures. Also, the construction method of foundation engineering is often easily overlooked, as it is considered technically simple and not a problem; however, there have been many lessons learned in this regard in the past. At the same time, it is necessary to calculate mechanized and factory-produced engineering projects, study the degree and method of mechanized construction, study the installation method of semi-finished products or model boards, and study the construction methods of special engineering projects such as prefabricated concrete, magnesite concrete, and foam concrete.

Third, organize technical supply. Technical supply includes the supply of labor, materials, tools, construction machinery, and equipment. Organizing and planning well in this area is a great guarantee for the completion of the project task. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the required amount and supply time of labor, materials, tools, and equipment based on the construction sequence and construction methods, and study the supply methods and methods, determine the supply responsibilities, and formulate guarantee measures. This work requires considering various factors and meticulously and practically formulating quarterly and monthly supply plans. Otherwise, phenomena such as work stoppage due to waiting for materials and work stoppage due to waiting for tools will occur, hindering construction progress.

Fourth, allocate construction management personnel and clarify organizational division of labor. In the allocation of personnel on the construction site, it is necessary to appropriately allocate technical strength and administrative management personnel based on the nature of the project and technical requirements; mechanically dividing them equally based on workload is inappropriate. In the organizational division of labor on the construction site, it is necessary to adhere to and implement the responsibility system of the construction site director. At the same time, different construction site organizational structures should be established according to different projects. An unsound construction site organization and unclear division of responsibilities have a great impact on the progress of the project. In 1952, some construction sites implemented a "workshop system," dividing the construction leadership of a project and assigning them to various workshops. For example, concrete projects were constructed by the concrete mixing plant, carpentry projects were constructed by the carpentry factory, and steel bars were constructed under the direct leadership of the construction worker dispatched by the steel bar processing workshop. As a result, the construction site director could only direct bricklayers to lay bricks. This practice of not having unified construction leadership cannot implement the construction site director responsibility system, and the result will inevitably be a lack of cooperation and no one responsible, resulting in poor project quality.

Fifth, conduct site layout. The layout of the Pingfang Zidi School project in Harbin last year is a typical lesson. The open space near the buildings on the construction site that could be used for storing materials was originally unrestricted, but because the site layout and material storage were not carefully considered before construction, all the white ash used for the main building was piled about 20 meters from the main entrance of the new building, and the lime soaking pool was placed between the white ash and the main entrance. Other large materials such as red bricks, sand, and gravel had to be placed far away from the building, increasing the transportation distance. After a large amount of earthwork was excavated from the foundation and basement of the project, it was piled around the building like a levee, and all kinds of materials had to be transported over the levee, greatly affecting the progress of the project. Therefore, conducting site layout is also an important part of the construction organization design. It is necessary to conduct a preliminary survey, consider all the conditions available on the construction site, and carefully arrange transportation roads, power supply, water supply, drainage, communication lighting, temporary engineering, material and equipment storage locations, etc. Finally, a construction master plan must be drawn, marking the site layout, construction sequence, and other details on the drawings.

In order to do a good job in construction organization design, according to past experience, the following issues must be paid attention to:

First, leading cadres must attach importance to it and adhere to its implementation.

Whether the construction organization design work can be implemented and whether it can play its due role in national basic construction depends on whether the leading cadres of each construction unit attach importance to it and adhere to it. Because this is a pioneering work, we still lack complete experience. Among technical personnel, the idea of "we have done this in the past" can easily arise, resulting in insufficient attention to this work. Indeed, for site layout, project progress plans, etc., each construction site had to plan a little bit in the past. However, there were many problems in this regard in the past, and the consideration of organizing construction issues was often piecemeal and fragmented, without comprehensively raising it to the principle of construction organization design and meticulously planning it. Recently, the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau Construction Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry held several discussions. After studying the content and requirements of the construction organization design, many construction site directors and engineers expressed that they had not done enough in the past. As one engineer said: "We did not understand construction design well in the past and need to humbly learn from scratch." On the other hand, some people may admit the importance of construction organization design, but think of it as too mysterious, believing that it is difficult to do at present and that there are no conditions. In fact, construction organization design can and should be done on any construction site. The complexity or simplicity of its content and the degree of requirements should be based on the nature and scale of the project. The above two views are one-sided and must be corrected.

Second, it must be practical, tap potential, and implement the principle of economic accounting.

In the process of preparing the construction organization design, the most economical principle should be considered, and the potential capacity in basic construction should be fully estimated. For example, when preparing a labor supply plan, the advanced construction methods and the average advanced labor efficiency after the promotion of advanced experience should be considered, and the minimum required amount after accounting for balanced allocation should be calculated. The same applies to the preparation of technical supply plans. The supply plan proposed by the Nanhu construction site in Shenyang last year required that all materials be delivered to the site before May (within one month after the start of construction), which was not practical and resulted in a large amount of cement being stockpiled and wasted.

Third, we must resolutely fight against conservative thinking.

In the process of preparing the construction organization design, every problem should be researched and decided, especially the research and selection of construction methods, and we must resolutely overcome conservative thinking. When organizing the construction of the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant projects in Anshan, the Soviet experts suggested establishing a concrete mixing plant for centralized mixing due to the task of more than 70,000 cubic meters of concrete engineering, which was opposed by many people with conservative ideas at the time. They emphasized that centralized mixing would increase transportation costs, while decentralized mixing would be easier to control the supply and more convenient. Even after the leadership decided to adopt the Soviet experts' suggestion, some people still opposed it, saying that the storage of more than 100,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel materials after centralized mixing would be difficult, and that building 10,000 square meters of cement floor for the concrete mixing plant was a "waste." Now the facts have proved that the Anshan concrete mixing plant has played a great role in completing the tasks of the two major projects. It ensured the quality of concrete engineering, saved concrete mixing equipment, and created favorable conditions for the ongoing winter construction.

The construction season is approaching, and all construction units must do this work as early as possible to ensure that construction starts on time and the project progresses smoothly.

    不做好施工组织设计就不能施工
    沈光瀚
    在一九五三年的施工准备工作中，制订施工组织设计应列为头等重要的工作。
    几年来的经验证明，有了充分、周密的准备，才能保证工程的速度和质量，才能降低工程成本。三年来，基本建设战线上出现了无数的先进经验，从根本上改革着施工方法，并向着施工机械化、工厂化的方向发展。而今后我们所要建设的又都是技术复杂的、庞大的近代化企业。这两种情况就决定我们再不能用落后的陈旧的方法盲目施工了，整个施工组织必须具有科学的、高度的计划性，必须充分做好施工的一切准备工作，否则就会拖迟建设速度。基于这样的要求，强调不做好施工组织设计就不许施工，是完全必要的。
    施工组织设计应该包括：建筑程序、年工作量进度表、施工总平面图、当地可供应的建筑材料的计算、临时建筑物的设计、临时道路水电的供应、施工机械及工具需要的数量、临时施工车间的设计、所需职工的数量及工种的比例等。过去很多人不了解这项工作的重要，往往不做好施工设计就进行施工，结果出了好多毛病。例如材料堆集到地基之上，运输道开在管道之上，临时建筑物占了运输道路。……总之，由于没有进行施工组织设计，给国家造成的损失是惊人的。一九五二年哈尔滨第四工程处三十七栋宿舍工程在修好后才挖暖气沟。这时气候已是冬季零下二十五度，十万土方已成冻土，原先一工可挖四立方公尺，这时三个人一天才挖一立方公尺，使成本增高十二倍，还影响了工期。另一方面，去年的事实也说明：凡是重视了施工组织设计的单位，施工进行就比较顺利。鞍山钢铁公司在大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂两大工程的施工中就重视了施工组织设计，特在工地上设立了施工设计科，专对技术复杂的工程进行施工设计，结果成绩很大。如该两大工程的设备基础，质量要求很高，基础螺丝中心线的容许偏差要求得非常严，这样精密的工作在安装技术上是有困难的。但由于进行了固定架的施工设计，目前已顺利安装了一万多根地脚螺丝，全部合乎质量标准。
    施工组织设计究竟包括什么内容？根据一般施工过程和经验，工程现场在接受任务和研究图纸后，即应通盘研究下列几个问题，编制施工组织设计。
    第一、决定施工程序。施工程序的决定是整个工程任务能否有秩序、有计划地完成的关键。因此，必须根据生产要求及工程性质，合理地决定那个工程先干，那个工程后干；那个部分工程先干，那个后干。即进行“工程排队”，编定全年工程工作量进度表。在正式施工前规划好整个施工步骤，就可以平衡施工计划的实施，平衡人力、物资的供应，克服以往施工过程中“开始闲，后半期抢工”的突击现象，以便集中人力、物力于先开工的工程。
    第二、研究施工方法。施工程序决定后，必须研究采取什么技术措施和施工方法来完成。例如采取平行流水作业施工法，不仅整个工程布置要配合，对如何分段及其他一些技术措施也要进行研究。又如基础工程的施工方法，往往容易被人忽视，认为技术简单，不成问题；但过去在这方面的教训很多。同时，必须计算机械化、工厂化的工程项目，研究机械化施工的程度和方法，研究半成品或模型板的安装方法，以及研究预制混凝土、棱苦土、泡沫混凝土等特殊工程项目的施工方法。
    第三、组织技术供应。技术供应包括劳动力、材料、工具、建筑机械设备等的供应。在这方面若能组织计划得好，对工程任务的完成就是个很大的保证。因此，必须根据施工程序和施工方法来计算劳动力、材料、工具、设备的需要量和供应时间，并研究供应的方式、方法，确定供应的责任和订出保证措施。这个工作需要考虑各种因素，细致地、切合实际地编制分季分月的供应计划。不然就要发生停工待料、停工待具的现象，阻碍施工进行。
    第四、配备施工管理人员，明确组织分工。在工地人员配备上，必须根据工程性质和技术要求，适当配备技术力量和行政管理人员；机械地根据工作量来平均分摊是不妥当的。在工地组织分工上，必须坚持贯彻工地主任责任制，同时应根据不同的工程，建立不同的工地组织机构。工地组织不健全，责任划分不明，对工程的进行有着极大的影响。一九五二年有些工地实行了“车间制”，把一个工程的施工领导分割开来，分别隶属于各车间。如混凝土工程由混凝土搅拌厂来施工，木作工程由木工厂来施工，钢筋由钢筋加工车间派施工员直接领导施工，结果工地主任只能指挥瓦工砌砖。这种没有统
    一施工领导的做法，不能贯彻工地主任责任制，其结果一定互不配合，无人负责，工程质量低劣。
    第五、进行场地布置。去年哈尔滨平房子弟学校工程的布置就是个典型的教训。该工地建筑物附近可供存储材料的空地本来不受限制，但由于施工前没有周密考虑场地布置和材料堆放，全部大楼用的白灰都堆置于新建筑物正门约二十公尺的地方，淋灰池又安置于白灰与正门之间，其他红砖砂石大宗材料不得不放在距离建筑物较远的地方，增加了运输距离。该工程地基和地下室的大量土方挖出后，像筑土堤一样堆置在建筑物四周，所有各种材料必须翻越土堤才能运到，大大影响了工程的进行。因此，进行场地布置也是施工组织设计中的重要内容之一。应该先行勘查，考虑建筑现场一切可资利用的条件，周密布置运输道路、电力供应、给水、排水、通讯照明、暂设工程、材料设备堆放地点等，最后须绘制施工总平面图，把场地布置、建设顺序等都标明在图纸上。
    为了作好施工组织设计，根据过去的经验，必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一，领导干部必须重视，并坚持贯彻。
    施工组织设计工作能否贯彻，能否对国家基本建设起到应有的作用，决定于各施工单位的领导干部是否重视和坚持。因为这是一个初创的工作，我们还缺乏完整的经验。在技术人员中，则很容易产生“过去已经这样做了”的想法，因而对这项工作不够重视。的确，如对场地布置、工程进度计划等，以往每个工地都要计划一下。但是过去这方面存在的问题很多，而且对于组织施工问题的考虑往往是点滴的、片断的，没有完整地把它提高到施工组织设计的原则上周密地加以计划。最近中央重工业部东北有色金属局建设工程公司曾举行了几次讨论会，许多工地主任、工程师在研究了施工组织设计的内容与要求后，都表示过去做得很不够。正如一位工程师所说：“我们过去对施工设计是似懂非懂，需要虚心地从头学起。”另一方面，又可能有些人承认施工组织设计的重要，但是又把它想得过分玄妙，认为目前很难做到，没有条件。实际上，施工组织设计任何工地都可以做，都应该做。其内容的复杂或简单，要求的程度，要以工程的性质和规模为转移。上面两种看法都是片面的，必须端正。
    第二，必须切合实际，挖掘潜力，贯彻经济核算的原则。
    在编制施工组织设计的过程中，应该考虑最经济的原则，充分估计基本建设中的潜在能力。如编制劳动力供应计划，就应考虑先进的施工方法和先进经验推广后的平均先进劳动效率，核算平衡调配后的最低需要量。编制技术供应计划也是如此。去年沈阳南湖工地提出的供应计划，要求全部材料在五月以前（开工后一月内）送到现场，这就是不切实际需要的，结果使大量水泥积压浪费。
    第三，必须坚决向保守思想作斗争。
    在编制施工组织设计的过程中，每一项问题的研究决定，特别是施工方法的研究选择，必须坚决战胜保守思想。鞍山大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂两大工程组织施工时，因有七万多立方公尺混凝土工程任务，苏联专家建议设立混凝土搅拌厂集中搅拌，当时曾遭到不少有保守思想的人的反对。他们强调集中搅拌要增高运输成本，分散搅拌容易控制供应，比较方便。甚至在领导上决定采纳苏联专家的建议后，尚有部分人反对，说集中搅拌后，十万多立方公尺砂石材料的堆放有困难，混凝土搅拌厂要修建一万平方公尺的洋灰地是“浪费”。现在事实证明，鞍山混凝土搅拌厂在完成两大工程任务中起了很大作用。它保证了混凝土工程质量，节省混凝土搅拌设备，并为正在进行的冬季施工创造了有利条件。
    施工季节已日益临近，各施工单位必须及早把这项工作做好，以保证按时开工，保证工程顺利进行。
