Editor's Note: The incident in Anhua County, Hunan Province, where fifth district cadre Cao Chunsheng arbitrarily used the charge of "counter-revolutionary" to beat farmers Wang Hongkai and Wang Zhenjia to death and injure Wang Qingshan, shows that the bully style of certain staff members in suppressing the masses has developed to an extreme, lawless degree. There are many similar serious incidents in our grassroots organizations. Now, the local People's Government has sentenced the main culprit Cao Chunsheng to death, which is entirely correct. In order to effectively eliminate this bully style, we believe that the relevant personnel who violated the law and neglected their duties in this case must also be given appropriate criminal or administrative punishment. Party member cadres among them must also be subject to Party discipline. The leading organs of Anhua County should, in connection with this case, examine the deviations in the education and use of cadres, review the reasons for the occurrence of this case, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

In the fifth district of Anhua County, Hunan Province, a serious illegal incident occurred in which district cadre Cao Chunsheng and others, harboring grudges and fabricating charges, beat to death Chenwang Township farmers Wang Hongkai and Wang Zhenjia (supervisors of the township cooperative) and injured Wang Qingshan. The main culprit, Cao Chunsheng, has been sentenced to death by the local People's Government.

The murderer, Cao Chunsheng, was twenty-two years old, from Dajiang Township, eighth district, Anhua County, Hunan Province, with a middle peasant family background and a student origin. He joined the revolutionary work in April 1951, and his style has always been arrogant and oppressive to the masses. In the two months he worked in Chenwang Township last year, he personally or ordered militiamen to illegally detain, beat, scold, force to kneel, and starve more than fifty farmers. The masses hated him to the bone. In mid-May last year, locusts were discovered in the second and fifth districts of Anhua County, and County Head Xiong Shaoan went to the fifth district to arrange locust eradication work. At the cadres' meeting held in the fifth district, Zhang Hesong, deputy secretary of the district party committee, used the slogan of "three points of mobilization and seven points of coercion" to deploy this work to the masses. In late May, each township began to eradicate locusts. Chenwang Township belongs to the fifth district, and the masses have a higher level of awareness. All kinds of work have always been done well. After the locusts were discovered, the masses responded to the government's call and actively participated in the eradication. On May 26th and 27th, most of the locusts had been wiped out. On the evening of June 1st, Wang Zhuxiang, the acting director of the peasant association of Malu Village, Chenwang Township, convened a mass meeting to continue arranging the task of locust eradication. At that time, the masses had some opinions. Middle peasant Wang Hongkai (former deputy village head before the land reform) proposed: "We should actively respond to Chairman Mao's call. However, it has been raining for more than twenty days in a row, and the grass in the cornfields has not been weeded for forty or fifty days, and sweet potatoes have not been planted. Now there are not many locusts. We have more mountains and less land here, and our main food every year depends on the income from the mountains. If we don't do it in these sunny days, we won't be able to do it if it rains again. If we miss the production season, we will starve next year." Poor peasant Wang Qingshan added: "The elderly, children, and women can go to catch locusts, and young adults can go to production. It is better to respond to the government's call and not delay production." His opinion was unanimously approved by the masses. Finally, Wang Zhuxiang proposed: "Everyone will go back to the group to sign and seal, and then report to the township for approval before implementation." Everyone agreed and then dispersed. The next day, the whole village continued to eradicate locusts. On the evening of June 2nd, Chen Mengran, a cadre of the district cooperative, came to Malu Village and convened a mass meeting to arrange locust eradication work again. The masses raised the above opinions to Chen Mengran. Chen Mengran did not dare to make a decision and sent Wang Zhuxiang to invite Cao Chunsheng, the leader of the working group of this township, to solve the problem. The masses elected Wang Hongkai as a representative, preparing to make demands after Cao Chunsheng arrived. Wang Hongkai knew that Cao Chunsheng had a bad style and did not dare to come forward. The masses said: If you are punished, we will all be guilty. After Cao Chunsheng arrived, he conveyed the emergency mobilization order and asked everyone if they had any opinions. Wang Hongkai talked about the opinions of the masses. Before he finished speaking, Cao Chunsheng ran into the room and asked Wang Zhuxiang: "Who is this person? What has he done in the past?" The masses talked about it. After Cao Chunsheng ran out of the room, he became furious and said: "Previously, the work in your Malu Village was very good; today's reflection must be caused by bad elements. Now, regardless of men, women, old, and young, everyone must eradicate locusts! Those who oppose it will be severely punished! Let's see how many heads you have!" Cao Chunsheng then announced the adjournment of the meeting, but asked Wang Hongkai to stay alone and questioned him, saying: "Why do you oppose the government's call?" When the masses saw that Wang Hongkai was detained, they surrounded him. Wang Zhenjia, the supervisor of the township cooperative, said: "Wang Hongkai was elected by all the villagers. If you want to ask, ask everyone." Some farmers also asked Cao Chunsheng: "What is the class origin of Comrade Cao? Show us your attitude!" and criticized: "We don't want him to lead with such a bureaucratic style!" Seeing that the situation was not good, Cao Chunsheng turned with the wind, pretended to admit his mistake to the masses, and released Wang Hongkai. Wang Hongkai, Wang Zhenjia, and Wang Qingshan criticized Cao, saying: "You don't understand the situation and criticize casually. We are all middle and poor peasants, and there are no bad elements." Wang Hongkai was afraid that Cao Chunsheng would retaliate in the future, and comforted Cao, saying: "We are all one family." After the meeting, Wang Hongkai said to the masses: "Comrade Cao has accepted our criticism, and tomorrow we will step up the eradication of locusts." The next day, the masses more enthusiastically participated in the eradication of locusts.

Cao Chunsheng was criticized by the masses, returned to the township People's Government, and was so angry that he couldn't sleep all night. On the morning of June 3rd, he wrote a letter to Wang Zhitang, the deputy head of the fifth district, the gist of which was: Yesterday, at the mass meeting for locust eradication in Malu Village, bad elements destroyed the meeting and deliberately attacked me. Please, district head, come to deal with it. Otherwise, I won't do it anymore. On the one hand, he sent Chen Tongsheng, the captain of the Chenwang Township militia, to find out the situation of Wang Hongkai, Wang Zhenjia, and Wang Qingshan in Malu Village. That afternoon, Cao Chunsheng received a reply from Deputy District Head Wang Zhitang, the gist of which was: Lao Cao: Don't be afraid to act. Detain them if you should, imprison them if you should. You can't do without detaining them! You can hold a cadres' meeting and criticize them, but don't fight them fiercely. Cao Chunsheng then convened Wang Zhuxiang, the acting director of the village peasant association, and Wang Youkun, the acting village chief, who had personal grudges with Wang Hongkai, to discuss countermeasures, and called Chen Tongsheng over. Cao Chunsheng asked them for the "materials" of Wang Hongkai and others. Wang Zhuxiang said: "They are not good people. Wang Hongkai was a soldier (was drafted by the Kuomintang and served as a Kuomintang soldier for half a year), and he was imprisoned for a few days during the land reform because he cut a few bundles of thatch." Cao Chunsheng said: "Being a soldier twice is a ruffian, and cutting down forests is destroying the land reform. Now District Head Wang has written a letter, and we have a way." He then proposed to hold a struggle meeting that night, and at the same time planned: Beat Wang Hongkai hard, beat him to death if he dies, and send him to the district if he doesn't die; beat Wang Zhenjia half to death; beat Wang Qingshan lightly, and imprison him in the township People's Government after beating him. He then ordered elementary school teachers to write slogans of "Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries." And notified all the township militia and village cadres to come to the meeting. When more than 100 militiamen and more than 30 village cadres arrived, Cao Chunsheng mobilized and said: "Chenwang Township is a first-class township, and all kinds of work are good. Now, counter-revolutionary elements have emerged in Malu Village. Wang Hongkai, Wang Zhenjia, and Wang Qingshan are destroying the locust eradication work, resisting the government, and attacking district and township cadres. We must fiercely struggle against them tonight!" At that time, Deputy Township Head Wang Yaoyun wanted to stop this illegal action, saying that he would let Malu Village send representatives to apologize to Cao Chunsheng, but Cao Chunsheng ignored it. Cao Chunsheng then ordered Chen Tongsheng to send more than ten militiamen to arrest Wang Hongkai and the other three. Wang Hongkai and others were beaten when they were arrested. When they were taken to the township People's Government, the militia shouted the slogan "Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries." Cao Chunsheng sat on a stool in front of the meeting place and ordered the three to kneel in front of him. Cao Chunsheng first announced the "criminal" facts of Wang Hongkai and the other three, and then said: "Yesterday you mobilized the masses to beat me to death, and tonight I mobilized the militia to beat you to death. Let's see who beats whom to death!" He then ordered the militia to beat them with wooden sticks and bamboo strips. After beating them for about ten minutes, Cao Chunsheng ordered them to stop and asked Wang Hongkai and the other three to "confess." He first asked Wang Hongkai, but Wang Hongkai did not answer. Cao Chunsheng said: "This is playing tricks!" He ordered the militia: "Just use all your strength, and I will be responsible for killing them!" Then they beat them again until Wang Hongkai and the other three were bloody, fell to the ground, and could only breathe through their nostrils. Acting Township Head Wang Zhongai had just returned from another village. Seeing this situation, he knew that Wang Hongkai and the other three were not counter-revolutionary elements, but because of personal grudges, he did not stop them, but said: "They should be beaten! These three bad guys attack cadres, and it's not a loss to beat them!" When they started beating again, Wang Zhenjia shouted "Comrade Cao, save me." Cao Chunsheng said: "Go and call Chiang Kai-shek to save you. Who am I serving!" After about an hour, Wang Hongkai and Wang Zhenjia were beaten to death, and Wang Qingshan was injured. After Wang Hongkai and Wang Zhenjia died, Deputy Township Head Wang Yaoyun asked Cao Chunsheng: "What if they are beaten to death?" Cao said: "If ten are beaten to death, there are only five pairs!" He immediately ordered Chen Tongsheng to bury the corpses. Township Clerk Chen Zili stopped them. Wang Zhongai then devised a plan to hang the deceased on the window, pretending that the deceased had hanged themselves. Before dawn on the fourth day, Cao Chunsheng sent Wang Zhongai and Wang Zhuxiang to report to District Head Wang, stipulating the content: "On the evening of the second, Wang Hongkai and others bought off the masses and surrounded me, asking me to kneel down and confess my history. Last night, when we caught them in the township government, they all hanged themselves." Later, they made a false report to the district, saying that Wang Hongkai and others were "the core figures of an assassination organization" and were going to carry out a riot. That morning, Cao Chunsheng issued a ban: First, the families of the deceased were not allowed to cry; second, they were not allowed to bury them in coffins; third, the masses were not allowed to help, and the families of the deceased had to carry the corpses out for burial. Wang Hongkai's father refused to accept this "ban" and was tied up and beaten. Cao Chunsheng also declared the families of the deceased as "counter-revolutionary elements" and implemented control. Then, he forced more than 30 farmers to write "repentance letters." Farmer Wang Jiayou was forced to kneel in the sun because he wrote a little late. Then, the membership of eleven farmers who had made suggestions to Cao Chunsheng was expelled from the farmers' association. Wang Zhuxiang, Wang Zhongai, and Wang Youkun carried shotguns and waist knives in the village, warning the masses: "No three or five people are allowed to be together, otherwise they will be treated as counter-revolutionaries and killed without compensation!" And went to the homes of Wang Hongkai, Wang Zhenjia, and Wang Qingshan to search for counter-revolutionary documents. On the morning of June 4th, Deputy District Head Wang Zhitang and Xiao Chunhua, a staff member of the County Public Security Bureau, went to Chenwang Township and listened to Cao Chunsheng's false report. Wang Zhitang thought it was really a "riot" and that there might be a reactionary organization, and instructed Cao Chunsheng to continue to investigate carefully. When he entered the township People's Government, he saw that farmer Wang Jiayou was tied up, his head was bleeding, and he was kneeling in the sun; he also talked to Wang Qingshan once, but he did not pay attention to it or thoroughly investigate the case, only mentioning lightly at the militia meeting held in the evening: "In the future, we can't beat people to death anymore." After he went back, he made a report of a "riot case" to the district. On June 6th, Cao Chunsheng and others struggled against Wang Qingshan again, sentenced Wang Qingshan to three years of control, stipulated that he report to the township People's Government every seven days, and also formulated six "law-abiding" covenants for him. He also detained Wang Xingjia and others who shouted slogans on the evening of June 2nd. When they were released, they were also forced to admit their mistakes to the masses and kneel for half a day.

Xiao Chunhua, the staff member of the County Public Security Bureau who went to Chenwang Township on June 4th, listened to Cao Chunsheng's report and believed that the incident in Malu Village was not a riot; after returning, he reported to the County Public Security Bureau. The County Public Security Bureau reported the situation to the CPC Anhua County Committee. On June 10th, Chen Benyuan, the president of the Anhua County People's Court, was sent to Chenwang Township to investigate, exposing the truth of the case, and detained Cao Chunsheng (Cao has now been sentenced to death). On June 17th, the Anhua County People's Government sent Qiao Jihua, the head of the Civil Affairs Section, to Chenwang Township to carry out post-mortem work. On June 25th, County Head Xiong Shaoan went to Chenwang Township again, explained the Party's policies to the masses through various meetings, admitted the mistakes of the district and township cadres, dispelled the masses' worries, apologized to the families of the deceased, and provided compensation and treatment to the injured. He removed the "counter-revolutionary family" hat that had been falsely accused, and restored the membership of the eleven members of the farmers' association who had been expelled.

    湖南省安化县区干部曹春生恶霸作风严重
    竟违法乱纪打死农民王宏开和王振家
    当地人民政府已将主犯曹春生判处死刑
    编者按：湖南省安化县第五区干部曹春生随意以“反革命”罪名，打死农民王宏开、王振家，打伤王青山的事件，说明某些工作人员压制群众的恶霸作风已经发展到登峰造极、无法无天的地步。类似的严重事情，在我们的基层组织中还有不少。现当地人民政府已判处主犯曹春生死刑，这是完全正确的。为了有效地肃清这种恶霸作风，我们认为对与此案有关的违法失职人员，也必须给予适当的刑事处分或行政处分。其中的党员干部，还必须受到党纪的制裁。安化县领导机关应联系此案，检查对干部教育、使用中的偏向，对发生此案的原因做出检讨，并保证今后不发生类似事件。
    湖南省安化县第五区发生区干部曹春生等挟嫌报复、捏造罪名，打死陈王乡农民王宏开、王振家（乡合作社监事），打伤王青山的严重违法事件。主犯曹春生已经当地人民政府判处死刑。
    凶犯曹春生，二十二岁，湖南省安化县第八区大浆乡人，家庭中农成份，学生出身。一九五一年四月参加革命工作，一贯作风蛮横，欺压群众。去年在陈王乡工作的两个月中，曾亲自或命令民兵对五十多个农民实行非法的关押、打骂、罚跪、饿饭。群众恨之入骨。去年五月中旬，安化县第二、五两区发现蝗虫，县长熊邵安去第五区布置捕蝗工作。在第五区召开的干部大会上，区委副书记张鹤松曾以对群众“三分动员，七分强迫命令”的口号布置这一工作。五月下旬，各乡开始捕蝗。陈王乡属第五区，群众觉悟较高，一向各种工作均做得较好。发现蝗虫后，群众即响应政府号召，积极捕打。五月二十六、七两日，已把蝗虫捕灭大半。六月一日晚，陈王乡马路村代理村农民协会主任王柱祥召集群众大会，继续布置捕蝗任务。当时群众有些意见。中农王宏开（土地改革前任副村长）提出：“毛主席的号召，我们应该积极响应。但一连落了二十几天雨，四、五十天来玉米地里的草没锄，红薯也没种，现在蝗虫又不多了，我们这里山多田少，每年主要粮食要靠山上的收入。这几天天晴不搞，再下了雨就搞不得了。失去生产季节，明年就得饿肚子。”贫农王青山更补充说：“老、幼、妇女可去捕蝗，青壮年去生产，既响应了政府号召，又不耽误生产，岂不更好。”他的意见得到群众一致赞成。最后王柱祥提议：“各人回到组内签名盖章，报乡批准后再实行。”大家同意后便散了会。第二天，全村仍继续捕蝗。六月二日晚，区合作社干部陈孟然来到马路村，召集群众大会，又布置捕蝗工作。群众向陈孟然提出了上述意见。陈孟然不敢做主，即派王柱祥请本乡工作组长曹春生来解决。群众推举王宏开为代表，准备在曹春生来后提出要求。王宏开知道曹春生作风恶劣，不敢出面。群众表示：你受了处分，大家同罪。曹春生来后，传达了紧急动员令，问大家是否有意见？王宏开就把群众的意见谈了一遍。话还没说完，曹春生就跑进屋里问王柱祥：“这是什么人？过去搞过什么？”群众议论纷纷。曹春生跑出屋来后便大发脾气说：“先前你们马路村的工作是很好的；今天这样反映，其中一定有坏分子捣乱。现在不管男女老幼，都要捕蝗！如有反对的就严办！看你们有几个脑壳！”曹春生随即宣布散会，但又让王宏开单独留下，并且质问说：“政府的号召你为什么反对？”群众见王宏开被扣留，围了上来。乡合作社监事王振家说：“王宏开是我们全村人选出来的，要问，问大家。”有的农民也问曹春生：“曹同志是什么阶级出身？向我们表明态度！”并批评说：“这样官僚主义作风，我们不要他领导！”曹春生见势不好，顺风转舵，假装向群众承认错误，释放了王宏开。王宏开、王振家、王青山批评曹说：“你不了解情况，随便批评，我们这些人都是中、贫农，没有坏分子。”王宏开怕曹春生以后报复，又安慰曹说：“我们都是一家人。”散会后，王宏开向群众说：“曹同志接受了我们的批评，明天我们要加紧捕蝗。”第二天，群众更踊跃地参加了捕蝗。
    曹春生受了群众的批评，回到乡人民政府，气得一夜没睡着。六月三日早晨，他写信告诉第五区副区长王智堂，大意为：昨日马路村开捕蝗群众会，会上有坏分子破坏，故意打击我，请区长来处理。不然，我不干了。一面又派陈王乡民兵中队长陈同生到马路村了解王宏开、王振家、王青山的情况。当日下午，曹春生接到副区长王智堂的回信，大意是：老曹：你不要缩手缩脚。该扣就扣，该关就关，不扣不行！可开个干部会，批评一下，但不要狠斗。曹春生随即召集和王宏开等有私人成见的代理村农民协会主任王柱祥，代理村长王又坤开会，研究办法；并把陈同生也叫来。曹春生向他们问王宏开等人的“材料”。王柱祥说：“他们都不是好人。王宏开当过兵（被国民党抓丁，当过半年国民党兵），土地改革中因为砍了几担茅柴，被关过几天。”曹春生就说：“当过两次兵是兵痞，砍伐森林是破坏土地改革。现在王区长来信，咱们有办法了。”便提出当晚开斗争会，同时计划：狠打王宏开，打死就打死，打不死就送区；王振家打个半死；王青山打轻一点，打后关到乡人民政府。随即令小学教员写“镇压反革命”的标语。并通知全乡民兵和村干部来开会。民兵到了一百多人、村干部到了三十多人的时候，曹春生就动员说：“陈王乡是一类乡，各样工作都好，现在马路村出了反革命分子，王宏开、王振家、王青山破坏治蝗工作，对抗政府，打击区乡干部，今晚要狠狠地斗争！”当时副乡长王耀云想制止这种违法行动，说让马路村派代表给曹春生道歉，但曹春生并不理会。曹春生随即令陈同生派十余民兵前往捕捉王宏开等三人。王宏开等在被捕时，即遭到殴打；被捉到乡人民政府时，民兵即喊“镇压反革命”口号。曹春生坐在会场前的凳子上，令三人跪在前面。曹春生先宣布王宏开三人的“罪恶”事实，然后说：“昨天你们发动群众要打死我，今晚我发动民兵要打死你们，看谁打死谁！”便命令民兵用木棍、竹片乱打起来。打了约十分钟，曹春生命令停下来，要王宏开等三人“坦白”。先问王宏开，王宏开没回答。曹春生说：“这是玩花样！”命令民兵：“只要使出你们的力气来，打死我负责！”于是又乱打起来，直到王宏开等三人头破、倒地、鼻孔只能出气为止。代乡长王忠爱刚由外村回来，见到这种情形，明知王宏开等三人不是反革命分子，但因平时有私人成见，因而不但不制止，反说：“该打！这三个坏家伙打击干部，打得不亏！”又开始打时，王振家喊
    “曹同志救命”。曹春生说：“你去叫蒋介石救命吧，我是为谁服务！”约一个多钟头，打死了王宏开、王振家，打伤了王青山。王宏开、王振家死后，副乡长王耀云问曹春生：“打死怎么办？”曹说：“打死十个，只有五双！”即令陈同生将尸埋掉。乡文书陈自力制止了他们。王忠爱遂设计把死者吊在窗子上，装成死者自缢模样。四日天未明，曹春生即派王忠爱、王柱祥给王区长汇报，规定内容是：
    “二日晚上，王宏开等收买群众把我围起来，要我跪下坦白历史，昨晚把他们抓到乡政府，都自缢了。”以后又向区做假报告，说王宏开等是“组织暗杀团体的核心人物”，要进行暴乱。当天早晨，曹春生更发下禁令：一、不准死者家属哭泣；二、不准用棺材埋葬；三、不准群众帮忙，必须死者家属把尸身背出埋葬。王宏开的父亲不服这种“禁令”，遭到捆打。曹春生并宣布死者家属为“反革命分子”家属，实行管制。接着又强迫三十多个农民写“悔过书”。农民王家友因写得晚了一点，被罚跪晒太阳。接着又开除了曾经向曹春生提意见的十一个农民的农会会籍。王柱祥、王忠爱、王又坤在村中扛着鸟枪，带着腰刀，警告群众：“不准三、五人在
    一块，违者以反革命论处，打死白打！”并到王宏开、王振家、王青山家中搜查反革命证件。六月四日上午，副区长王智堂和县公安局的工作人员萧春华到了陈王乡，听了曹春生的假报告。王智堂认为真是“暴乱”，可能有反动组织，嘱咐曹春生要继续好好了解。他进到乡人民政府时，看见农民王家友被捆绑着，头上流着血，跪晒在太阳底下；他又和王青山谈过一次话，但均未引起注意，深入调查此案，只在晚间召开的民兵大会上轻描淡写地提了一句：
    “今后可不能再打死人了。”他回去后，向区作了一个“暴乱案”的汇报。六月六日，曹春生等又斗争王青山，判了王青山三年管制，规定每七日向乡人民政府汇报一次，还给他订出了六条“守法”公约。又扣押了六月二日晚喊口号的王兴家等人。在释放时还让他们向群众承认错误，罚跪半天。
    六月四日去陈王乡的县公安局工作人员萧春华，听了曹春生的报告，认为马路村发生的事件不是暴乱；回去之后，便向县公安局做了汇报。县公安局把情况反映到中共安化县委会。六月十日，安化县人民法院院长陈本源被派往陈王乡进行调查，揭发了案件的真实情况，并扣押了曹春生（现已将曹判处死刑）。六月十七日，安化县人民政府派了民政科长乔际华到陈王乡进行善后工作。六月二十五日，县长熊邵安又到陈王乡，通过各种会议，向群众讲解党的政策，承认区乡干部的错误，解除群众顾虑；并向死者家属道歉，给予抚恤，伤者给予医治。摘去被诬的“反革命家属”的“帽子”，恢复了被开除的农会会员十一人的会籍。
