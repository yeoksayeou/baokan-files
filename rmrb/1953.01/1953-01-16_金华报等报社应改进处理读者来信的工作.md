    Jin Hua Bao and Other Newspaper Offices Should Improve the Handling of Readers' Letters
    Comrade Editor: In mid-December of last year, the People's Government of Pan'an County, Zhejiang Province, sent me to the Shenzhai District People's Government under its jurisdiction to inspect the handling of people's letters. I discovered that the district paid no attention to this work and had a serious bureaucratic style. A large number of letters from the masses were piled up. However, this also exposed the shortcomings in the handling of readers' letters by some newspaper offices. For example, from December 1951 to November 1952, the district received six readers' letters forwarded from the Jin Hua Bao and the Hangzhou Peasant Masses Newspaper, and one reader's letter forwarded from the Zhejiang Daily, all of which were not handled. Of course, the district people's government must bear a great responsibility. However, I believe that the aforementioned newspaper offices also have a bureaucratic style of simply forwarding the letters and being done with it. These seven readers' letters were forwarded to the district, some for several months, some for nearly a year, and the aforementioned newspaper offices never urged them to be handled. Is it that these letters had no content and were not worth urging? No. Jin Hua Bao forwarded a letter to the district in early July last year from Chen Sixi, of Yongjiatang Village, Cuifeng Township, reporting the theft of wooden planks by cadres of Xihu Village in the township. Recently, after the county people's government sent a special person to investigate, it was found to be completely true. The village cadres had collectively embezzled about 140 cubic feet of wooden planks confiscated during the land reform, worth 4 million yuan, and used their power to suppress and threaten the whistleblowers (this case has now been transferred to the county people's court for handling). Is this a small matter? However, Jin Hua Bao has not paid attention to it since forwarding the letter. According to the current situation, many people write to newspaper offices because they have difficult problems to solve or have been persecuted by bad elements. Therefore, I believe that newspaper offices should establish a system for urging the handling of readers' letters and promptly inform the letter writers of the results; resolutely oppose phenomena such as "forwarding and being done with it" and "not caring and not asking," so as to give full play to the role of criticism and self-criticism in newspapers.　Xu Kexiao

### 金华报等报社应改进处理读者来信的工作

    金华报等报社应改进处理读者来信的工作
    编辑同志：去年十二月中旬，浙江省磐安县人民政府派我到所属深宅区人民政府检查处理人民来信工作时，发现该区对这一工作毫不重视，存在着严重的官僚主义作风。大批群众来信被积压着。但是，这当中同时也暴露了某些报社处理读者来信工作中的缺点。如一九五一年十二月到一九五二年十一月间，该区共收到从金华报社和杭州农民大众报社转来的读者来信六件，浙江日报社转来的读者来信一件，都未作处理。当然该区人民政府要负很大责任。但我认为上述报社对处理读者来信也存在着转出了事的官僚主义作风。这七件读者来信转到该区，有的已几个月，有的将近一年了，一直未见上述报社催办过。是否这些信没有什么内容，不值得催办呢？不是的。金华报社在去年七月初转该区的翠峰乡第四村永加堂村陈嗣熹反映该乡西湖村干部盗窃木板的情况，最近经县人民政府派专人前去调查结果，完全是事实。即该村干部曾经集体贪污土地改革中所没收的木板约一百四十方，值四百万元，并利用职权压制，威胁检举人（这一案件现已转县人民法院处理）。这是一件小事情吗？而金华报社自转去这件信后，就不管不问了。据现有情况看，群众写信给报社，很多都是因为有了难解决的问题或受到了坏分子的迫害。所以，我认为报社都应该建立对处理读者来信的催办制度，及时把处理结果告知来信人；坚决反对“转出了事”、
    “不管不问”等现象，以发挥在报纸上开展批评与自我批评的作用。　徐可孝
