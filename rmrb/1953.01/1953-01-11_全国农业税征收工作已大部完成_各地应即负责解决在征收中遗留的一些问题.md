The collection of the national agricultural tax in 1952 had been more than 70 percent completed by the end of last December. With the exception of remote provinces such as the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Xikang, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, where the autumn harvest was later and farmers are busy delivering grain, public grain in other parts of the country has been entirely or mostly stored in warehouses. It is expected that the collection work will be completed in full this January.

The 1952 agricultural tax collection work further implemented the Government Administration Council's policy of "surveying fields to determine production, calculating taxes according to rates, legally reducing or exempting taxes, and absolutely no surcharges," and on this basis, launched a more organized and more enthusiastic patriotic grain delivery movement.

Since the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on the 1952 Agricultural Tax Collection Work" on June 16 last year, more than two-thirds of the country's regions have successively carried out field surveys to determine production. Preliminary statistics show that in 1952, over 76 million mu of concealed land was discovered nationwide, and the authenticity and balance of normal annual yields were greatly improved. On this basis, all localities resolutely implemented the policy of calculating taxes according to rates, reducing the phenomenon of excessively high or low burdens. In order to earnestly implement the policy of calculating taxes according to rates, many regions uniformly calculated farmers' tax amounts by county or district, compiled registers, and directly issued tax payment notices to farmers. Farmers generally reflected: "In the past, tax payment was determined by assessment, and no one could really know; this year it is calculated according to regulations, and we are willing to pay more or less." Some also said: "This year, the completion of public grain payment is clear and transparent, with thorough understanding from top to bottom. It is truly fair and just!" On the basis of calculating taxes according to rates, most regions paid attention to implementing the Government Administration Council's "Measures for Reducing or Exempting Agricultural Tax for Disaster-Stricken Farmers," correcting the unreasonable practice of "package reduction and exemption" in the past. Many regions in East China and Northwest China adopted the method of "investigating disaster situations from top to bottom, discussing and evaluating reductions and exemptions from bottom to top, and reporting to the government for review and approval," achieving "greater reduction for severe disasters, lesser reduction for minor disasters, no reduction for very minor disasters, and full exemption for very severe disasters," which generally satisfied the masses. Revolutionary old base areas that suffered more serious war damage and where farmers' lives were difficult also had their original tax rates reduced by 5 to 30 percent, depending on the circumstances. The masses in the old areas of Shandong Province said with emotion: "Chairman Mao is in Beijing, but his heart is still concerned about the old base areas!"

From a national perspective, the overall burden on farmers in 1952 was lighter than in 1951. This was mainly because the Government Administration Council stipulated the cancellation of the original local surcharge, which was equivalent to 20 percent of the regular tax, and various localities reorganized rural finance and abolished many unreasonable apportionments. Of course, in some areas, due to inaccurate field yields in the past, the burden increased somewhat after the field yields were verified; in areas where industrial raw material crops were taxed too lightly in the past, the tax rates were appropriately increased. This practice of balancing the burden, increasing those that should be increased and decreasing those that should be decreased, is reasonable. After repeated and patient publicity and explanation by cadres at all levels, the vast majority of farmers expressed their support for the policy.

Due to the fairness and rationality of the agricultural tax, the cancellation of surcharges and the reduction of apportionments, the in-depth publicity work, the bumper harvests in most areas, and the increased political awareness of farmers, the enthusiasm of farmers for paying grain in 1952 was higher than in previous years. Farmers screened and sun-dried the public grain to be paid three times before delivering it to the grain depot. The grain delivered by farmers in many areas was "dust-free to the touch and dry and crisp to the bite."

However, there were also many shortcomings in the 1952 agricultural tax collection work. For example, the normal annual yields set by various regions still had some unevenness, resulting in varying burdens on farmers, which was particularly evident in the border areas of various regions. For example, among the 159 pairs of border townships between Henan and Anhui, apart from two pairs of townships with balanced yields, the yield in 27 townships in Henan was lower than in Anhui, with a difference of 5 to 30 percent; the yield in 130 townships in Anhui was lower than in Henan, with 25 of them having yields that were more than 50 percent lower. This created unfair burdens and aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. This phenomenon more or less existed within other provinces and regions. Some areas had more general calls for legally reducing or exempting taxes, but fewer specific measures; coupled with the complexity of various disaster situations, certain phenomena of failing to reduce when reductions should have been made, or reducing when reductions should not have been made, occurred in actual implementation. Some cadres had a task-oriented view of "simply pursuing speed" in the grain delivery work and a bureaucratic style, and the organization and inspection of grain delivery were still not strict enough. Serious accidents involving injuries and deaths of people and livestock delivering grain occurred in some areas. In addition, due to more rain and snow in some areas, coupled with lax inspection, the moisture content of the grain entering the warehouse was high, which increased the loss rate of public grain and made storage more difficult.

Areas where the autumn collection has basically ended should conduct inspections: Those who have failed to implement legal reductions or exemptions, failed to reduce when reductions should have been made, or failed to exempt when exemptions should have been made, thereby affecting the lives of farmers, should be refunded according to law. Those who have suffered injuries or deaths of people and livestock should be given treatment, compensation, and pensions separately. Those responsible for the accidents must be given due punishment and announced to the masses. As for the phenomenon of excessively high or low production settings, it should be corrected in future field surveys to determine production, in order to achieve fair and reasonable burdens. In addition, attention should be paid to timely turning and drying public grain with excessive moisture content to prevent mold and spoilage.

### 全国农业税征收工作已大部完成  各地应即负责解决在征收中遗留的一些问题

    全国农业税征收工作已大部完成
    各地应即负责解决在征收中遗留的一些问题
    一九五二年全国农业税的征收工作，截至去年十二月底已完成百分之七十以上。全国各地除东北、内蒙、新疆、青海、西康、云南、广东、广西、福建等边远省份因秋收较晚，农民正在紧张送粮外，其余各地的公粮业已全部或大部入仓。预计今年一月可全部完成征收工作。
    一九五二年农业税征收工作进一步贯彻了政务院
    “查田定产，依率计征，依法减免，决不附加”的方针，并在这个基础上展开了更加有组织、更加热烈的爱国缴粮运动。
    自去年六月十六日政务院发布“关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示”后，全国三分之二以上的地区先后开展了查田定产工作。初步统计，一九五二年全国共查出瞒田七千六百余万亩，并把常年应产量的真实性和平衡程度大大提高了一步。各地在这一基础上坚决贯彻了依率计征的方针，减少了负担偏高偏低现象。为了切实贯彻依率计征的方针，许多地区由县或区统一计算农户税额，编造清册，直接对农户开发纳税通知书。农民普遍反映：“过去纳税是评出来的，谁也难以知道；今年是按章程计算出来，纳多纳少都情愿”。也有的说：“今年完纳公粮有板有眼，上下摸底，真是天公地道！”在依率计征的基础上，绝大部分地区注意执行了政务院的“受灾农户农业税减免办法”，纠正了过去“减免包干”的不合理的做法。华东和西北的许多地区采取了“自上而下调查灾情，自下而上评议减免，报经政府审核批准”的办法，做到“重灾多减，轻灾少减，特轻不减，特重全免”，群众一般满意。对受战争创伤较重、农民生活困苦的革命老根据地，也根据不同情况，分别减低原税额的百分之五至百分之三十。山东省老区群众感动地说：“毛主席人在北京，心还惦记着老根据地！”
    从全国看来，一九五二年农民的总负担，比一九五一年是减轻了。这主要是由于政务院规定取消了原来相当正税百分之二十的地方附加，各地又整理了乡村财政，废止了许多不合理的摊派。当然，有一部分地区，过去因田亩产量不实，在查实田亩产量后，负担较前增加了一些；过去工业原料作物课税过轻的地区，也适当提高了税率。这种平衡负担，应增者增，应减者减的作法是合理的，经过各级干部反覆地耐心地宣传解释，广大农民对政策都表示拥护。
    由于农业税的公平合理，附加的取消和摊派的减少，宣传工作的深入，大部地区的增产丰收和农民政治觉悟的提高，使一九五二年农民的缴粮热情较往年更高。农民们把应缴公粮经过三筛三晒，才送缴粮库。许多地区农民所缴的粮食是“手摸没尘土，牙咬干嘣嘣”。
    但是，一九五二年农业税的征收工作中也存在不少缺点。如：各个地区所订的常年应产量，还有某些高低不平的现象，以致农民的负担轻重不一，尤以各地区的交界地带较为显著。如河南与安徽的一百五十九对交界乡中，除两对乡订的产量平衡外，河南低于安徽的二十七乡，相差百分之五至三十；安徽低于河南的一百三十乡，其中有二十五乡所定的产量低百分之五十以上。这就造成负担不公现象，引起群众不满。这种现象在其他省区内部也或多或少地存在着。有的地区对依法减免工作，一般号召多，具体办法少；加以各种灾歉情况的复杂，以致在实际执行中，发生某些当减不减，不当减而减的现象。有些干部对送粮工作存在着“单纯图快”的任务观点和官僚主义作风，对送粮的组织、检查工作仍不够严密，有些地区还发生了送粮人畜伤亡的严重事故。此外，部分地区因雨雪较多，加以检查不严，入库粮食水分较大，使公粮亏耗率加大并增加保管困难。
    现在秋征已基本结束的地区，应该进行检查：有未贯彻依法减免、应减不减、应免不免以致影响农民生活者，应依法清退。凡人畜伤亡者应分别给予治疗、抚恤和赔偿。对事故责任者必须给以应得的处分，并向群众公布。至于订产偏高偏低现象，今后应在查田定产工作中加以改正，以达到负担的公平合理。此外，公粮含水分过大者，须注意及时翻晒，以免霉坏。
