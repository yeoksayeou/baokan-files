Northeast China's state-owned and local state-owned industrial production departments exceeded the original plan in 1952, increasing production and saving the equivalent of 11,570,220 tons of grain for the country. If we add the achievements of the capital construction sector in increasing production and saving, this figure will be greatly exceeded.

The increase production and savings campaign in Northeast China in 1952 was launched under the favorable conditions of the successful experience of the 1951 increase production and savings campaign, the victorious gains of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, stable prices, improved living standards for workers and staff, and unprecedentedly enhanced political awareness of workers and staff. After Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, issued a call for increased production and savings throughout the region in May last year, the increase production and savings campaign in Northeast China immediately flourished. In less than a month, all departments mobilized the masses to complete the work of formulating plans.

The increase production and savings campaign in Northeast China last year generally went through the following three stages: studying documents to clarify the principles of increase production and savings; mobilizing the masses to tap potential and formulate plans; and promoting advanced experiences and launching competitions to achieve plans.

In the early stages of the campaign, some leading cadres in certain departments underestimated the infinite creative power of the masses and the potential capacity of enterprises, and thus developed conservative ideas. When drawing up plans, they did not carefully analyze and study the situation in their departments and put forward advanced plans for discussion by the workers and staff. Instead, they simply followed the example and assigned tasks downwards; or they did not use the level that could be achieved after the promotion of advanced experience as the plan target, but limited the plan target to the so-called general level or even the backward level, resulting in unrealistic plans and the failure to unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. After the local Party committees discovered this situation, they immediately carried out repeated criticisms and used typical examples of advanced units to educate them, so that the leading cadres of these departments had a clearer understanding of the principles of increase production and savings, and the campaign developed rapidly and normally.

After the principles of increase production and savings were understood and mastered by the enterprise leaders, the campaign entered the stage of mobilizing the masses to tap potential and formulate plans. In this stage, the factories and mines first conducted in-depth ideological mobilization of the workers and staff, and then mobilized the masses to discuss the great significance and favorable conditions for completing the plan, and guided the masses to turn the process of formulating the plan into a process of finding tricks, summarizing and learning advanced experiences. Therefore, at the beginning of the campaign, a mass upsurge of creativity was formed, and advanced production methods emerged continuously. According to the statistics of 67 factories in Shenyang and Harbin alone in the early stage of formulating plans, more than 21,800 tricks of various kinds appeared, which greatly promoted the increase production and savings campaign in various factories. However, in this stage, some deviations still occurred in some departments. The leading cadres of these departments simply relied on financial personnel and technicians to find ways, and did not mobilize all the workers and staff to come up with ideas. As a result, the plans that were drawn up were neither advanced nor practical. Another deviation was that the importance of improving quality was ignored when drawing up plans, and the issue of fully utilizing the potential of the enterprise was not taken into consideration. In order to correct these deviations, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee promptly instructed all units to thoroughly mobilize workers and staff to participate in the formulation of plans, and at the same time to conduct a general review of the team plans and "quality make-up lessons." This made the increase production and savings plans of each department, from factories and workshops to teams and groups, generally achieve the following two points:

(1) The plan targets were based on the level that could be achieved after the promotion of advanced experience, or the level that could be achieved after overcoming certain shortcomings in the current production; (2) According to the requirements of the plan, more specific technical measures plans were made.

After the departments entered the stage of implementing the plan, they enthusiastically launched competitions and tightly grasped the basic methods of promoting advanced experience and mobilizing the masses to find tricks. The Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened five advanced experience promotion conferences in half a year, and issued more than ten decisions on promoting advanced experience. The industrial systems also separately convened advanced producers' conferences, rewarded outstanding advanced experience creators and promoters, and further summarized and improved various advanced experiences. These measures made the advanced experience promotion campaign form an unprecedented scale, and dozens of advanced experiences in the whole region were widely promoted.

While vigorously promoting advanced experiences, the departments also followed the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and actively improved the working conditions and welfare work of the workers and staff. This further enabled the workers and staff to exert greater enthusiasm in the increase production and savings campaign.

In order to overcome various difficulties and erroneous ideas arising in the process of the movement's development, the entire Northeast region also launched a timely mass inspection movement. This played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the increase production and savings plan.

The tremendous achievements of the increase production and savings campaign of state-owned and local state-owned industries in Northeast China have accumulated funds and experience for the country's large-scale economic construction. However, the majority of units should actively learn from the experience of advanced units, vigorously change the situation that production management is far behind the requirements of production plans and mass enthusiasm, and improve one step further, in order to further improve labor productivity and adapt to the requirements of the country's large-scale economic construction.

### 东北区国营及地方国营工业生产部门  超额完成去年增产节约计划

    东北区国营及地方国营工业生产部门
    超额完成去年增产节约计划
    【本报讯】东北全区国营工业和地方国营工业生产部门，一九五二年超过原定计划，为国家增产节约了价值一千一百五十七万零二百二十吨粮食的财富，如果加上基本建设部门的增产节约成绩，还要大大超过这个数字。
    东北地区一九五二年的增产节约运动，是在一九五一年增产节约运动成功的经验、“三反”“五反”运动胜利的收获和物价稳定、职工生活改善、职工政治觉悟空前提高等有利条件下开展起来的。东北人民政府主席高岗于去年五月间向全区发出增产节约的号召后，东北区增产节约运动立即蓬勃展开。不到一个月，各部门即发动群众完成了制订计划的工作。
    东北地区去年的增产节约运动，一般经过了下面三个阶段，即：学习文件，明确认识增产节约的方针；发动群众，发掘潜力，制订计划；推广先进经验，开展竞赛，实现计划。
    运动初期，某些部门的领导干部由于对群众无穷的创造力量和企业的潜在能力估计不足，因而产生了保守思想。他们在订计划时，不是认真地对本部门情况进行充分的分析研究，提出先进的计划，交给职工群众讨论，而是接到任务后，照样画葫芦地分摊下去；或者不是以先进经验推广后可能达到的水平作为计划指标，而是把计划指标限制在所谓一般的水平甚至落后的水平上，致使计划订得不切实际，群众的积极性、创造性也得不到发挥。各地党委发现这种情况后，立即反复地进行批判，并用先进单位的典型事实进行教育，使这些部门的领导干部对增产节约的方针有了较明确的认识，从而打破了保守思想，运动便迅速而正常地开展起来。
    当增产节约的方针为企业领导干部认识和掌握以后，运动就转入了发动群众发掘潜力与制订计划的阶段。在这一阶段中，各厂矿先对职工进行深入的思想动员，然后发动群众讨论完成计划的重大意义与有利条件，并引导群众把制订计划的过程变为找窍门、总结和学习先进经验的过程。因此，运动一开始就形成群众性的创造热潮，先进生产方法不断涌现。仅据沈阳、哈尔滨两市六十七个工厂在制订计划初期的统计，就出现了各种窍门两万一千八百多个，对各厂增产节约运动起了很大的推动作用。但是在这一阶段中有些部门仍然发生了偏差。这些部门的领导干部单纯依靠财务人员和技术人员想办法，不去发动全体职工出主意。因之订出来的计划既不先进，也不切合实际。另一种偏差是订计划时忽视提高质量的重要性，没有考虑到全面发挥企业潜力的问题。为了纠正这些偏差，中共中央东北局曾及时指示各单位必须彻底发动职工参加制订计划，同时要普遍进行一次小组计划的复查和“质量补课”。这就使得各部门最后制订的从工厂、车间到班组的增产节约计划，一般做到了以下两点：
    （一）以先进经验推广后可能达到的水平，或克服了目前生产中存在的某些缺点后可能达到的水平作为计划指标；（二）根据计划的要求，作出了比较具体的技术措施计划。
    各部门进入执行计划的阶段后，热烈地展开了竞赛，并紧紧地掌握着推广先进经验和发动群众找窍门的基本方法。东北人民政府与东北总工会半年中连续联合召开了五次先进经验推广大会，发布了十余项关于推广先进经验的决定。各产业系统也都分别召开了先进生产者大会，奖励了优秀的先进经验创造者和推广者，进一步总结和提高了各种先进经验。这些措施使得推广先进经验运动形成了空前未有的规模，全区数十种先进经验都普遍地推广了。
    各部门在大力推广先进经验的同时，又遵循中共中央东北局的指示，积极改善了职工的劳动条件与福利工作。这就进一步使职工群众在增产节约运动中发挥出更大的积极性。
    为了克服运动发展过程中所产生的各种困难和错误思想，东北全区还及时发动了一个群众性的检查运动。这对保证完成增产节约计划起了不小作用。
    东北地区国营工业和地方国营工业增产节约运动的巨大成就，为国家大规模经济建设积累了资金和经验。但是，多数单位还应积极学习先进单位的经验，大力改变生产管理还远远落后于生产计划和群众积极性的要求的情况，并提高一步，以进一步提高劳动生产率，适应国家大规模经济建设的要求。
