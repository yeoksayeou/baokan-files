    Albanian People's Victory Day
    Bi'erbi'er Keliáoxi
    Minister of Justice of the People's Republic of Albania
    Eight years ago, with the help of the glorious Soviet army and under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people drove the last remnants of the German fascist bandits from their territory, thus forever shaking off the shackles of slavery and taking power into their own hands.
    Albania, located at the gateway to the Adriatic Sea, has always been coveted by imperialists for its strategic location and natural resources. Disregarding the hatred and resistance of our people, they have continuously interfered in Albania's internal affairs. On April 7, 1939, Italian imperialists, determined to turn Albania into their colony, sent fascist invading troops to forcibly occupy our country. Our people had repeatedly driven the fascist troops back into the sea. However, a small nation betrayed by national traitors at the time, lacking weapons and relying solely on its heroic fighting spirit, was unable to defeat the powerful imperialist enemy.
    The fascist Italian occupation of our country was one of the most brutal occupations. The fascist occupiers attempted to rule Albania and exploit and oppress the Albanian people through terror and with the help of their lackeys in Albania.
    On November 8, 1941, the Albanian Communist Party was founded in the dark basement of a small house in Tirana. The leader of the Party was Comrade Enver Hoxha, the most outstanding son of our people. The establishment of the Albanian Communist Party was the most significant event determining the fate of our people. The Communist Party organized and led our people in the struggle against the invaders and their servants. The Party established the National Liberation Front, uniting the people of the whole country to fight for the liberation of the motherland; the Party organized the guerrilla forces, and later established the National Liberation Army led by Comrade Enver Hoxha on the basis of this guerrilla force. The armed struggle against the fascist occupiers continued until the complete liberation of the country.
    The war destroyed 62,475 houses, hundreds of thousands of cattle and sheep, and all large and small bridges, power stations, and mines in the country, and burned down the port of Durrës and other places. This was a heavy loss for a small nation. But despite this, our people never bowed their heads. After the national liberation, we established the people's power—the people's democratic system—for the first time in the country. The long-standing ideal of the Albanian people has been realized, for which they have struggled for centuries.
    The people's power faced important and urgent tasks. It had to eliminate the remnants of fascism and internal reactionaries, domestic feudal lords and the bourgeoisie, and the servants of fascism. The people's courts quickly took on the task of dealing with war criminals and traitors to the motherland. All the property of the traitors and Quislings was confiscated and nationalized, and the property of speculators was also confiscated. All factories and all foreign enterprises were nationalized.
    We implemented land reform, confiscating the land of landlords and generals who had been sucking the blood and sweat of our peasants for centuries, and distributing it to landless and land-poor peasants. Due to the elimination of domestic enemies and the implementation of various major reforms, and the rapid repair of many damaged bridges, ports, and houses, we created all the conditions necessary for the implementation of a planned economy.
    With the completion of the Two-Year Plan (1949-1950), our economy and all political and cultural aspects have developed greatly. We are currently implementing the First Five-Year Plan from 1951 to 1955. Under the leadership of the Labor Party and its government, the Albanian people are building the foundations of socialism. The Five-Year Plan will transform Albania from a backward agricultural country into a country with developed agriculture and industry.
    Our industry has developed greatly. Before liberation, Albania had only a few small light industrial factories. Now we have built huge combined manufacturing factories such as the Stalin Textile Factory, sugar factories, and woodworking factories, and built new factories equipped with the latest machinery, such as cotton ginning factories, rice milling factories, cement factories, and other factories.
    Last year, the Lenin Hydropower Station began generating electricity. This hydropower station guarantees the water and electricity supply for our capital—Tirana. The huge hydroelectric power station named after Enver Hoxha is being built on the Mat River. Modern machinery is being installed in the mines, and production is increasing day by day. During the years of the Five-Year Plan, we will establish a huge oil refinery that will process all the petroleum products in the country.
    Albania, which previously had no railways, has now had three railways laid by the People's Government. They connect our largest port—Durrës—with the capital of our motherland and with the main central city of Elbasan.
    Along with economic development, the cultural level of our people has also improved. The network of primary and secondary schools has been greatly expanded, we have established vocational schools, and opened institutions of higher learning for the first time. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, there will be no more illiterates among people in our republic aged twelve to forty.
    The people's medical services have improved. Hospitals, sanatoriums, rest homes, clinics, maternity homes, nurseries, and kindergartens have been built throughout the country. New talents are being cultivated in Albania. Labor has become an obligation and a respected thing. Socialist emulation has become the working method of our working class and our advanced farmers. The Stakhanovite movement is being promoted throughout the country.
    The achievements made by the Albanian people since liberation on November 29, 1944, have been enormous. But undoubtedly, we would have even more achievements if our enemies—the American and British imperialists and their running dogs, the Tito gang in Belgrade, the Greek royalist fascists, and the Italian neo-fascists—did not disturb us. These most vicious enemies of our people and all mankind do not allow our people to live in peace, constantly harassing our peaceful construction life and sabotaging our socialist construction work. They often provoke us on our borders, sending various saboteurs to our country to organize sabotage activities and intimidate the people. But our people, morally and politically united as one, closely linked with their Party and the people's power, are not afraid of provocations and saboteurs. Our people, as Comrade Enver Hoxha taught, hold weapons in one hand and shovels in the other. Our people are vigilant, they themselves capture saboteurs and hand these people over to the people's courts.
    Our unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union, and the selfless help of the Soviet people to our people, are the most important factors for our victory in the struggle for liberation from German and Italian fascist fetters, and in the cause of establishing and consolidating people's power and building the foundations of socialism. Without the victory of the Soviet army, it would be impossible to imagine victory, no matter how heroic the Albanian people were. The Soviet Union and the great Stalin showed fatherly care for the development of all aspects of our life after liberation. In order to establish our industry, to modernize our agriculture, and to build a new life in our country, the Soviet Union gave us selfless material and technical assistance. The guarantee for the realization of our first Five-Year Plan is the comprehensive help of the Soviet Union, as well as the help of the people's democratic countries.
    The resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are the guiding star for our Party and our people. Comrade Hoxha, the leader of our Party, said at this Congress:
    "The miracle that a small nation of only one million two hundred thousand people can live freely and independently and build socialism under such conditions in our country is only possible in the era of Stalin—in the era when the ideas of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin have triumphed."
    The Adriatic coast is thousands of miles away from China, but our two peoples are as close as brothers, because they are linked by an unbreakable friendship, a Stalinist friendship.
    The great achievements of the Chinese people in building a new life are also our achievements. We regard the heroic struggle of the great Chinese people to defend their borders from the provocations of the American and British imperialists, and the struggle of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers to defend Korea, as a struggle to defend the security of our motherland.
    We pay tribute to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia. We warmly salute the great Chinese people and the peace defenders of the world. Their friendship is the guarantee of all victories of the Albanian people in building our new life.

### 阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利日

专栏：

    编者按：本月十一日是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立七周年纪念日。阿尔巴尼亚司法部部长毕尔毕尔·克廖西同志的这篇文章，原为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放八周年（去年十一月二十九日）而作，因收到较迟，特在今日发表。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利日
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国
    司法部部长
    毕尔毕尔·克廖西
    八年以前，阿尔巴尼亚人民在光荣的苏联军队的帮助下，在以恩威尔·霍查为首的共产党领导下，把德国法西斯匪帮的最后残余从国土上驱逐出去，从而永远摆脱了奴隶的镣铐，把政权掌握到自己的手里。
    阿尔巴尼亚地处亚得里亚海门户，它的战略地位及其自然富源，一直就为帝国主义者所垂涎。他们不顾我国人民的憎恨和抵抗，不断地干涉着阿尔巴尼亚的内政。一九三九年四月七日，一心想把阿尔巴尼亚变成它的殖民地的意大利帝国主义者，派遣了法西斯侵略军队来强占我国的国土，我国人民曾连续数次把法西斯军队赶回海中。可是当时被民族叛徒出卖了的一个小民族，缺乏武器，而仅仅依靠英勇的战斗精神是难以战胜强大的帝国主义敌人的。
    法西斯意大利对我国的侵占，是最残酷的一种占领。法西斯占领者企图以恐怖手段并藉它们在阿尔巴尼亚的走狗之助，来统治阿尔巴尼亚并剥削和压迫阿尔巴尼亚人民。
    一九四一年十一月八日，在地拉那一所小屋子阴暗的地下室里，阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立了。党的领导者就是我国人民最优秀的儿子恩威尔·霍查同志。阿尔巴尼亚共产党的成立，是决定我国人民命运的最巨大的事件。共产党组织并领导我国人民从事反对侵略者和他们的奴仆的斗争。党建立了民族解放阵线，团结全国人民为解放祖国而斗争；党组织了游击队，后来就在这支游击队的基础上建立了由恩维尔·霍查同志所领导的民族解放军。反对法西斯占领者的武装斗争直到全国完全解放时止，一直都在发展着。
    战争毁坏了六万二千四百七十五所住屋、数十万头牛羊和全国所有的大小桥梁、电力站、矿山，并焚毁了港口都拉索等地。这对于一个小民族来说是惨重的损失。但尽管如此，我国人民从未低过头。我们在全国解放后在国内第一次建立了人民的政权——人民民主制度。阿尔巴尼亚人民长久以来的理想实现了，为了这个理想，他们曾经斗争了几个世纪。
    人民政权面临着重要而迫切的任务。它必须肃清法西斯主义的残余和内部的反动派、国内封建主和资产阶级以及法西斯主义的奴仆们。人民法庭迅速地担负起了对付战犯和祖国叛徒的任务。卖国贼和吉斯林分子们的全部财产都被没收和收归国有，投机商人的财产也被没收了。所有的工厂和一切外国企业都被收归国有。
    我们实行了土地改革，没收了数世纪以来都在吮吸着我们农民的血汗的地主和将军们的土地，分给了无地与少地的农民。由于国内敌人的肃清和各项巨大改革的实现，由于许多被破坏的桥梁、港口、住宅的迅速修复，我们创设了为实行计划经济所需的一切条件。
    随着两年计划（一九四九年——一九五○年）任务的完成，我国的经济和所有的政治与文化已大大地向前发展了。目前我们在实行着由一九五一年至一九五五年的第一个五年计划。阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党和自己的政府的领导下，正在建设着社会主义的基础。五年计划将把阿尔巴尼亚由一个落后的农业国变成一个农业和工业都发达的国家。
    我国的工业已经大大地向前发展了。阿尔巴尼亚在解放以前只有几个小小的轻工业工厂。现在我们已兴建了像斯大林纺织工厂、制糖厂、木工厂等巨大的联合制造工厂，兴建了装配有最新式机器的新工厂，如轧花工厂、碾米工厂、水泥工厂和其他的工厂。
    去年，列宁水电站便开始发电了。这个水电站保证了我国首都——地拉那的水电供应。在玛特河上正在修建以恩威尔·霍查为名的巨大的水力发电站。矿坑里正在安装近代化机械，产量日高。在五年计划的年代中，我们将建立巨大的石油精炼厂，它将对全国所有的石油产品进行加工。
    从前没有一条铁路的阿尔巴尼亚，现在已由人民政府铺设了三条铁路。它们把我国最大的港口——都拉索同我们祖国的首都、以及同主要中心城市爱尔巴桑连结了起来。
    伴随着经济的发展，我国人民的文化水平也提高了。中、小学校网大大地扩展了，我们设立了职业专科学校，第一次开办了高等学府。五年计划终了时，在我们共和国十二岁到四十岁的人中将不再会有文盲了。
    人民的医药服务事业改善了。全国各地都修建了医院、疗养院、休养所、诊疗所、产育院、托儿所和幼儿园。在阿尔巴尼亚正在培育着新的人才。劳动已成为义务和受尊敬的事情。社会主义竞赛已成为我们工人阶级和我国先进农民的工作方法。斯塔哈诺夫运动正在全国推广着。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民从一九四四年十一月二十九日解放以来所获得的成就是巨大的。但是，如果我们的敌人——美英帝国主义者及其走狗贝尔格莱德的铁托匪帮，希腊保皇法西斯分子和意大利的新法西斯分子——不扰乱我们的话，无疑地我们会有更多的成就。我国人民的和全人类的这些最凶恶的敌人，不让我国人民安静，经常骚扰我们建设和平的生活和破坏我们建设社会主义的工作。他们时常在我国边境挑衅，派遣各种破坏分子到我国来组织破坏活动和恐吓人民。但是在道德上和政治上团结得像一个人一样的我国人民，紧密地和自己的党及人民政权联系在一起，是不怕挑衅和破坏分子的。我国人民，正如恩威尔·霍查同志所教导的，一手握着武器，一手握着铁锹。我国人民是警惕的，他们自己捕获破坏分子并把这些人交付人民法庭。
    我们对苏联的牢不可破的友谊，以及苏联人民对我国人民的无私帮助，是我们在争取由德、意法西斯羁绊下解放出来的斗争中，和我们在建立和巩固人民政权以及建设社会主义基础的事业中获得胜利的最重要的因素。如果没有苏军的胜利，那么，无论阿尔巴尼亚人民是如何的英勇，也是不可能想像会得到胜利的。苏联和伟大的斯大林对于我国解放后全部生活的发展，表现了慈父般的关怀。为了建立我们的工业，为了使我们的农业现代化，为了在我国建立新生活，苏联在物质上与技术上给予我们以无私的援助。我国实现第一个五年计划的保证，便是苏联的全面帮助，以及各人民民主国家的帮助。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议，是我党和我国人民的指路明星，我们党的领袖霍查同志曾在这次代表大会上说道：
    “一个只有一百二十万人口的小民族能够在我国所处的这样的条件下自由而独立地生活并建设社会主义，这种奇迹只有在斯大林的时代——在马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的思想得到胜利的时代，才可能发生。”
    亚得里亚海岸距离中国有千山万水之遥，但是我们两国人民却像兄弟一样的亲近，因为他们是为一种牢不可破的友谊、斯大林式的友谊所联系在一起的。
    伟大的中国人民在建设新生活中所达到的巨大成就，也是我们的成就。我们把伟大中国人民为保卫自己边疆不受美英帝国主义者挑衅的英勇斗争，把英勇的中国人民志愿军保卫朝鲜的斗争，都看做是保卫我们祖国安全的斗争。
    我们向苏联和欧亚两洲的各人民民主国家致敬。我们向伟大的中国人民和全世界的和平保卫者热烈致敬。和他们的友谊，就是阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设我国新生活中一切胜利的保证。
