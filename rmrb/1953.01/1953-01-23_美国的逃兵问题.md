A Short Commentary

    Before Acheson stepped down, he said at a banquet of the American "Diplomatic Personnel Association" that "The Korean War is terrible, but it is unavoidable in order to defend our way of life." He told those American diplomats, "You and I understand this principle, but it is not a matter of one or two days to make the general public understand this 'why'." Acheson admitted here that although the American ruling group has exhausted all means of deception, it still cannot make the American people believe that the Korean War, which is being waged thousands of miles away from the United States, is to "defend the American way of life." On the contrary, more and more American people have realized that this war was launched by the American monopoly capitalist groups in order to plunder more wealth. More and more American soldiers have become aware of this and are unwilling to risk their lives for the interests of Wall Street. The recently exposed sensational incident of large-scale desertions by American soldiers illustrates this very well.

    The U.S. government has been afraid to reveal the fact that a large number of U.S. soldiers have deserted. Until recently, the American "Louisville Times" began to reveal it one after another. According to the newspaper, there are 25,000 to 30,000 deserters in the U.S. military. The newspaper quoted a colonel as saying: "Any officer, when he gets a battalion of men, can immediately say without making any mistakes that before going abroad to fight, there will be fifty deserters in his team." The colonel admitted, "The vast majority of American parents are most concerned about how to prevent their sons from being drafted, and secondly, how to keep them from going." The U.S. Department of the Army, in order to cover up this situation, quickly announced that since the beginning of the Korean War, there have been a total of 46,000 deserters in the U.S. military. Anthony McAuliffe, the Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of personnel at the Department of the Army, while trying to minimize the situation, said that desertion in the U.S. Army is "not an alarming problem," but at the same time revealed that an average of 20,000 soldiers "go AWOL" every month. McAuliffe said that these soldiers quietly slipped away "after receiving notice that they were going abroad." They took various measures to avoid being sent to Korea as cannon fodder. They usually "overstay their leave, miss the train, and show up three or four days after their ship has sailed." And an average of at least 3,000 people never return.

    The American ruling groups are shifting responsibility for the problem of deserters and are engaged in a lot of infighting. But this cannot cover up the truth of the matter. Truman blamed the large number of deserters on MacArthur for setting a precedent for disobeying orders, while MacArthur said that this was the result of Truman's failure to accept his advice, which led to the failure of the invasion of Korea. But U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett simply admitted that this was "because many young people simply do not want to go to Korea to fight." Then the U.S. Department of the Army had to issue a statement saying, "The main reason for so many desertions at present is that everyone sees that they will soon be sent abroad for service."

    Because this "indecent thing" has aroused a lot of discussion in society, the U.S. military has come up with the bizarre idea of sending a group of so-called "scientists" and "doctors" to the battlefield to use "scientific" methods to study why American soldiers are unwilling to fight and unwilling to die for the monopoly capitalists. This method will certainly not solve the problem. Therefore, the U.S. Department of the Army took out their housekeeping skills and issued an order on the 15th, saying that soldiers who "go AWOL" and evade overseas service will be "escorted" by force and loaded onto the "first batch of ships" to be sent to the Korean battlefield. But this measure will only make more American people see the unjust nature of the Korean War and oppose this unpopular war even more. In an article, the "Louisville Times" talked about the impossibility of stopping desertion by strengthening discipline, and quoted a military officer as saying, "Public opinion is against us, that is the key." The U.S. government is now stepping up conscription and extending the term of military service in order to continue and expand the invasion of Korea. But as long as the U.S. ruling group continues to pursue its policy of aggression, the number of American deserters will inevitably increase greatly in the future.

    The problem of American deserters shows that the warmongers who are carrying out aggressive and unjust wars are isolated among the people and are therefore weak. Their arrogant violation of the people's desire for peace will inevitably be opposed by the people and will inevitably accelerate their shameful defeat.

### 美国的逃兵问题

    美国的逃兵问题
    艾奇逊下台之前在美国“外交人员联谊会”的宴会上说，“朝鲜战争是可怕的，但是为了保卫我们的生活方式是必不可免的。”他对那些美国外交官说，“你们和我都了解这个道理，但是要想人民大众人人都能了解这个‘为什么’，那并不是一天两天的事。”艾奇逊在这里承认，美国统治集团虽然用尽了一切欺骗手段，却仍然不能使美国人民相信在离美国几千里路以外进行的朝鲜战争是为了“保卫美国生活方式”。相反，越来越多的美国人民认识到了：这个战争是美国垄断资本集团为了掠夺更多的财富而发动的。越来越多的美国士兵觉悟到了这一点，不愿意为了华尔街的利益卖命了。最近被揭露出来的哄动一时的美军士兵大批逃亡的事件很好地说明了这一点。
    美国政府一直不敢透露美军士兵大批逃亡的事实。直到最近，美国的“路易斯维尔时报”才陆续透露出来。据该报说，美军的逃兵有二万五千到三万人。该报引一位上校的话说：“任何一个军官在得到一营人的时候，都可以马上不会有什么差错地说，在出国打仗以前，他的队伍里会有五十个人开小差。”这个上校承认，“绝大多数美国父母最关心的是怎样不让他们的儿子被征服兵役，其次是怎样使他们不去。”美国陆军部为了掩饰这一情况，赶紧宣布：从朝鲜战争开始以来，美军的逃兵一共是四万六千人。陆军部负责人事的助理参谋长安东尼·麦克奥里夫一面企图缩小事态，说美国陆军中的逃亡“并非一个惊人问题”，同时却又透露，平均每个月都有两万名士兵“擅离职守”。麦克奥里夫说，这些士兵都是在“接到通知要到国外去以后”悄悄溜走的。他们采取种种方法逃避被送到朝鲜去充当炮灰的命运。他们一般都是“超过假期，错过火车，等到他们的船走了以后三四天才露面”。而平均每个月至少有三千人是一去不回了。
    美国统治集团内部互相推卸逃兵问题的责任，发生了一片争吵。但这并不能掩盖住事情的真相。杜鲁门把逃兵如此之多归咎于麦克阿瑟开创了不服从命令的先例，而麦克阿瑟则说这是杜鲁门不接受他的意见因而使侵朝战争失败的结果。但是美国国防部长罗维特却干脆承认，这是“因为许多青年根本不愿意到朝鲜去打仗”。接着美国陆军部也不得不发表声明说，“目前逃跑事件如此多的主要原因是大家都看到自己不久就要被派到国外服役去了。”
    由于这一件“不体面的事情”已经引起了社会上的纷纷议论，于是美国军部就异想天开地派了一批所谓“科学家”“医生”到战场上去用“科学”方法研究美国士兵为什么不愿打仗，不愿替垄断资本家送死。这个办法当然不能解决问题，因此，美国陆军部就拿出他们的看家本领，在十五日发布一道命令说，凡是“擅离职守”、逃避海外服役的士兵将用武力“押送”，装上“第一批船只”解往朝鲜战场。但是这种措施也只会使更多的美国人民看清楚侵朝战争的非正义的性质，更加反对这个不得人心的战争。“路易斯维尔时报”在一篇文章中谈到不可能用加强纪律来制止逃亡时，引用一个军官的话说，“舆论是反对我们的，这就是问题的关键。”美国政府现在为了继续和扩大侵朝战争，正在加紧征兵，延长兵役期限，但只要美国统治集团继续推行侵略政策，今后美国的逃兵必然还要大大增多。
    美国的逃兵问题说明进行侵略性的非正义战争的战争贩子们，在人民中间是孤立的，因而是虚弱的。他们蛮横地违反人民的和平愿望，必然要遭到人民的反对，必然要加速他们的可耻的失败。
