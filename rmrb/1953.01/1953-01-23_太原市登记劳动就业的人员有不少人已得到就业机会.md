To the Editor:
    According to the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government established the Taiyuan Municipal Labor Employment Committee in September of last year. After its establishment, the committee first began registration work. During the registration process, many people with higher skills and education levels who met the current work needs successively obtained job opportunities; those who lost their ability to work have been classified and received appropriate relief in batches; those who have the ability to work but temporarily have no suitable work and are experiencing financial difficulties have also received relief. Regarding older individuals and general housewives, they will be gradually placed after some young people from various organizations and groups are transferred to factories. Among the registered personnel, more than 600 men and women with a cultural foundation, aged between 18 and 35, in good health, and with promising futures, were organized into a labor employment training class. This training class was established after the Municipal Labor Employment Committee convened a consultation meeting with the heads of personnel departments of relevant state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, as well as responsible comrades from various units, and signed personnel contracts. Therefore, those participating in the study have already been pre-assigned their future jobs. The training class started on December 15th of last year. The purpose of the training is to enhance the students' political awareness, master preliminary skills, and lay the foundation for serving the people. The students are studying and laughing with enthusiasm. People who registered for labor employment in Taiyuan City have all received care.

    编辑同志：太原市人民政府根据中央人民政府政务院所颁布的关于劳动就业问题的决定，于去年九月成立了太原市劳动就业委员会。这一劳动就业委员会成立后，首先开始登记工作。在进行登记工作中，不少有较高技术、文化程度的、符合当前工作需要的人员，陆续得到了就业的机会；丧失劳动力的，已分类分批得到了适当的救济；有劳动力但暂时无适当工作而生活困难的，也得到救济；关于一般年纪较大的和一般家庭妇女，待把各机关团体内的某些青年抽到工厂去后，逐步地安置他们。在登记的人员中，特别把有文化基础的，年在十八岁至三十五岁，身体健康，有培养前途的六百多男女，组织成劳动就业训练班。该训练班是在市劳动就业委员会召开有关各国营、地方国营厂矿企业人事科长以及各单位负责同志的协商会议签订了人事合同后建立的。所以，参加学习的人都已经被预定了他将来工作的岗位。该训练班于去年十二月十五日开学了。训练的目的，是为了提高学员们的政治认识，掌握初步的技术，打下为人民服务的基础。学员们在紧张地学习着、欢笑着。太原市登记劳动就业的人员，都分别得到了照顾。         力人倪
