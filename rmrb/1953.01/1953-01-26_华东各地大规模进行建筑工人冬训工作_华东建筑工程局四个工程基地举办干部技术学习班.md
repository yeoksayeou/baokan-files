Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 25th: Large-scale winter training for construction workers has been launched in various parts of East China. Nearly 30,000 workers in various provinces and cities are being trained centrally during work stoppages. Construction workers in coastal areas south of the Yangtze River are mostly receiving training while working. In many cases, temporary construction workers are being trained in their spare time.
    Before the start of winter training, basic construction departments in various provinces and cities in East China established specialized organizations from top to bottom, allocated personnel, and formulated plans to organize and prepare for leading the winter training work. The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Workers Winter Training Committee first selected and trained more than 100 cadres, assigning them to local winter training committees or training classes to strengthen leadership in the winter training work. The basic construction departments at the East China Administrative Area level and Shanghai also selected more than 400 cadres to assist in the winter training work of construction site workers in the Shanghai area. To strengthen leadership in the winter training work, the East China Administrative Committee Construction Engineering Bureau and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions East China Office recently convened a meeting of responsible cadres from provincial and municipal units under their respective systems to study the progress of winter training in various regions. At present, the construction workers participating in winter training in various places have very high learning enthusiasm. Each group in the Huainan Mining Bureau Construction Workers Training Class has formulated a patriotic learning pact. Workers from various construction sites of the Central First Ministry of Machinery Industry East China Construction Company jointly held a workers' representative conference of more than 1,400 people at the end of last year. The representatives attending the meeting all expressed their intention to intensify their studies during the winter training to welcome the country's first Five-Year Plan. Some groups in the company, combined with the study of advanced production experience, have improved work efficiency. For example, after learning Su Changyou's bricklaying method, the bricklaying group of Chu Adi on a certain construction site increased the number of bricks laid per day from 3,000 to 6,000. After learning Xie Wanfu's assembly line operation method, the carpentry group of Ling Qinglin improved work efficiency by 30 percent. In a certain base of the Housing Construction Office of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, the Xuan Aba group of the ditch and road team increased the amount of soil excavated per person from 3 cubic meters to more than 8 cubic meters, and the number of sheet piles driven from 50 to 180.
    The first stage of winter training in various parts of East China is political education. The second stage will summarize and promote advanced experience, and combine it with labor insurance registration and other work.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 24th: The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth engineering bases of the Housing Construction Office of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau are actively training construction technical personnel. In a very short period, they have quickly trained a large number of technical personnel equivalent to assistant construction engineers or construction engineers from site recorders and trainees. These engineering bases established cadre technical training classes as early as December 3 last year. The CCP organizations in the engineering bases attached great importance to leading this work, and specifically helped the administrative side establish a central group composed of engineers, technicians, and experienced veteran workers to lead the study of the cadre technical training classes. The participants in the study are mainly recorders (most of whom are outside cadres and students with some education but no understanding of basic construction) and trainees (who have a preliminary understanding of some technologies), followed by political work cadres and trade union cadres. The teachers are the main engineers from the on-site business departments. The textbooks include six types: common sense talks on weights and measures and materials, explanations of various business reports, knowledge of house, ditch, and bridge construction, level measurement, site layout talks, and talks on construction technical measures. Because teaching can be closely linked to practice, students are progressing rapidly. The thirty recorders who participated in the first phase of the training class learned the technology of assistant construction engineers, which used to take at least two years to learn, in less than two months, from the beginning of December last year to January 22 this year. They can not only accurately calculate the original statistical figures of labor, materials, and other aspects on the construction site, but also many of them can initially use leveling instruments for measurement and read construction drawings to master construction. Many trainees who participated in the study have also improved to the level of construction engineers. Political work cadres and trade union cadres have also learned some common sense about basic construction projects after studying. Now the base is planning to further improve the technical level of the original students and continue to recruit a new batch of students to make technical learning regular.

    华东各地大规模进行建筑工人冬训工作
    华东建筑工程局四个工程基地举办干部技术学习班
    【新华社上海二十五日电】华东各地建筑工人冬季训练工作已大规模地展开。各省、市停工集中训练的工人将近三万名。长江以南沿海地区的建筑工人，多半是一面做工一面受训。各地对许多临时建筑工人，都在他们的业余时间内，给予训练。
    华东各省、市基本建设部门在冬训开始以前，都自上而下建立了专门机构，调配了力量，订出了计划，有组织、有准备地领导冬训工作。江苏省建筑工人冬训委员会，首先抽调和训练了一百多干部，分配到各地冬训委员会或训练班，加强对冬训工作的领导。华东大行政区一级和上海的基本建设部门也抽调了四百多名干部，协助上海地区建筑工地工人的冬训工作。为加强对冬训工作的领导，华东行政委员会建筑工程局和中华全国总工会华东办事处最近召开了所属系统的各省、市单位负责干部会议，研究各地冬训工作进行情况。目前各地参加冬训的建筑工人学习情绪很高。淮南矿务局建筑工人训练班的每个小组都订了爱国学习公约。中央第一机械工业部华东建筑公司各工地工人，在去年年底联合举行了一千四百多人的工人代表大会。到会代表都表示要在冬训中加紧学习，迎接国家第一个五年建设计划。该公司有些小组结合学习先进生产经验，提高了工作效率。如某工地泥工储阿弟小组学习苏长有砌砖法后，每天由砌砖三千块增加到六千块。木工凌庆林小组学习谢万福流水作业法后，工作效率提高了百分之三十。华东建筑工程局工房工程处某基地沟路大队宣阿八小组每人挖土由三立方公尺增加到八立方公尺以上，打板桩由五十根增加到一百八十根。
    华东各地冬训工作第一阶段是政治教育。第二阶段将总结和推广先进经验，并结合进行劳动保险登记等工作。
    【新华社上海二十四日电】华东建筑工程局工房工程处第六、七、八、九工程基地，积极培养施工技术人材。在很短期间内，已迅速从工地纪录员、练习生当中训练出大批相当于助理施工员或施工员的技术人材。这些工程基地在去年十二月三日就成立了干部技术学习班。工程基地中共的组织十分重视对这一工作的领导，具体帮助行政方面建立了由工程师、技术员和有丰富经验的老工人组成的中心小组，领导干部技术学习班的学习。参加学习的主要是纪录员（大部是有些文化而对基本建设一点不懂的外来干部和学生）和练习生（初步懂得一些技术的），其次是政治工作干部和工会干部。担任讲课的教师是现场各业务部门的主要工程师。教材共有度量衡和材料的常识讲话、各种业务报表讲解、房屋、沟渠、桥梁施工知识、水平测量、场地布置讲话、施工技术措施讲话等六种。因为教学时能紧密地联系实际，学员们进步很快。参加第一期学习班学习的三十个纪录员，在去年十二月初到今年一月二十二日不到两个月的时间内，就学会了过去至少要学两年的助理施工员的技术。他们不仅能精确地计算工地上人工、材料等各方面的原始统计数字，并且有很多人能初步使用水平仪器进行测量和看施工图样掌握施工。不少参加学习的练习生也提高到施工员的水平。政治工作干部和工会干部经过学习后也懂得了一些基本建设工程上的普通常识。现在该基地正计划把原有学员的技术水平再提高一步，并继续吸收一批新的学员，使技术学习经常化。
