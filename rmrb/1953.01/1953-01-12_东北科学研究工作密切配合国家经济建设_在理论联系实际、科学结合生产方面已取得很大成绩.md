Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. Northeast scientific research work closely coordinates with economic construction and has achieved great results in combining theory with practice and science with production. Shortly after the liberation of Northeast China, the Northeast People's Government established the Northeast Institute of Science to restore and develop the economy. In August 1952, in order to cooperate with the upcoming large-scale economic construction and vigorously develop scientific research, the Northeast Institute of Science was reorganized into the Northeast Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The development of scientific research in Northeast China has been very rapid in the past three years. The investment in 1952 increased by 18 times compared with 1949, and the number of researchers increased by more than 300% compared with 1949. More than 30 major inventions and creations have been made. At present, the Northeast Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has a large scientific research institution: the Changchun Comprehensive Research Institute has more than a dozen research offices, including civil engineering, mining and metallurgy, and machinery; the Dalian Institute of Industrial Chemistry has research departments such as analytical chemistry, high-pressure hydrogenation, high-grade gasoline, synthetic fuel, and kiln industry; the Institute of Physical Chemistry was newly moved from Shanghai to Changchun; in addition, there is an instrument hall specializing in the manufacture and research of scientific instruments. Recently, a metal research institute is being built in Shenyang. Specialized civil engineering, electromechanical, soil, and forestry research institutes are also under preparation.

The Northeast scientific research work combines theory with practice and science with production in the following ways: First, it has established a research style of science serving economic construction, criticized incorrect research attitudes such as "drilling into a dead end" and "research for the sake of research" that are divorced from reality and based on personal interests. Thus, in accordance with national needs, especially the current urgent needs of the production departments, research plans are formulated, including the purpose, methods, steps, progress, and funding of the research. Second, in order to industrialize scientific research results, an intermediate factory (experimental factory) has been established. Usually, the scientific research results of the laboratory may not be directly produced on a large scale in the factory, and further experiments can be carried out after the intermediate factory is established. Therefore, the intermediate factory plays a bridging role from scientific research to industrial production, which can shorten the distance between scientific research and production. Third, the promotion of scientific research results has been emphasized. For example, the promotion of research results such as "nodular cast iron", "die casting method", "soil cement" and "standard triangular temperature measuring cone" has been warmly welcomed by the production departments. Fourth, it goes deep into factories, mines and farms to investigate and study problems in production, and has put forward many rationalization proposals to the industrial departments, and signed research contracts and promotion contracts for research results with relevant factories and mines.

In the past three years, Northeast scientific research work has done a lot of work for basic construction and production departments. In terms of basic construction, in 1951 alone, it inspected 1,347 soil test materials, 756 building materials, and more than 1,500 various analysis and verification samples for factories and mines in Northeast China. In 1952, in addition to continuing to carry out more inspection work, it also completed the strength test of mechanical properties of 22 kinds of wood in Northeast China and the determination of physical properties. This research result has become the basis for civil engineering design and construction in Northeast China. In terms of industrial production, for example, the successful research of molybdenite flotation has increased the grade and recovery rate of concentrate, which not only doubled the amount of ore, but also reduced the cost by half; the successful trial production of green silicon carbide has brought the production rate of a certain factory close to the Soviet standard. In terms of agricultural production, the Institute of Physical Chemistry has successfully trial-produced the strong seed fungicide "Xilisheng" and has established an intermediate factory for production. The laboratory products have been shipped to Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces. The Changchun Comprehensive Research Institute has signed a cooperation agreement with the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government to promote soybean rhizobia. In 1953, one million hectares (each hectare is equivalent to fifteen acres) of land in Northeast China will be inoculated with the excellent strains researched by the institute, which can increase soybean production by at least 600,000 tons.

    东北科学研究工作密切配合国家经济建设
    在理论联系实际、科学结合生产方面已取得很大成绩
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北科学研究工作密切配合经济建设，在理论联系实际、科学结合生产方面已取得很大成绩。东北解放不久，东北人民政府即为恢复和发展经济而建立了东北科学研究所。一九五二年八月，为配合即将来临的大规模经济建设，大力展开科学研究工作，东北科学研究所改建为中国科学院东北分院。三年来东北科学研究工作的发展十分迅速，一九五二年的投资比一九四九年增加了十八倍，研究人员比一九四九年增加了百分之三百以上；主要的发明创造已达三十多种。目前中国科学院东北分院拥有宏大的科学研究机构：所属长春综合研究所设有土木建筑、矿冶、机械等十几个研究室；大连工业化学研究所设有分析化学、高压加氢、高级汽油、合成燃料、窑业等研究部门；物理化学研究所是新从上海搬到长春的；另外还有专门制造和研究科学仪器的仪器馆。最近，又正在沈阳修建金属研究所。专门的土木建筑、机电、土壤和林业研究所也正在筹建中。
    东北科学研究工作在理论联系实际、科学结合生产方面是这样做的：第一，树立了科学为经济建设服务的研究作风，批判了脱离实际凭个人兴趣“钻牛角尖”和“为研究而研究”等不正确的研究态度，从而按照国家需要，特别是当前生产部门的急需，制订研究计划，其中包括研究的目的、方法、步骤、进度和经费等。第二，为了使科学研究成果工业化，建立了中间工厂（实验工厂）。通常实验室的科学研究成果不一定能直接在工厂中大规模生产，建立中间工厂后就可以进一步实验。因此中间工厂起了由科学研究过渡到工业生产的桥梁作用，它可以缩短科学研究与生产间的距离。第三，重视了科学研究成果的推广工作。如“球墨铸铁”、“压铸法”、“土壤水泥”和“标准三角测温锥”等研究成果的推广，已受到生产部门的热烈欢迎。第四，深入工厂、矿山和农场，调查研究生产中的问题，向产业部门提出了很多合理化建议，并与有关厂矿订立研究合同和推广研究成果的合同。
    东北科学研究工作三年来为基本建设和生产部门做了很多工作。在基本建设方面，仅一九五一年即为东北各厂矿检验土壤试料一千三百四十七件、建筑材料七百五十六件及各种分析、检定试样一千五百多件。一九五二年除继续进行更大量的检验工作外，还完成了东北二十二种木材力学的强度试验及物理性能测定。这一研究结果已成为东北土木建筑设计和施工的根据。在工业生产方面，如辉钼矿浮选研究成功，精矿品位和回收率提高，不但使矿量增加一倍，而且成本还降低了一半；绿色金刚砂的试制成功，使某厂生产率接近了苏联标准。在农业生产方面，物理化学研究所试制强烈种子杀菌剂“西力生”已经成功，并已建立中间工厂进行生产。实验室的产品已运至山东、山西、陕西、河南等省。长春综合研究所已与东北人民政府农林部订了推广大豆根瘤菌的合作协议书，一九五三年东北将有一百万垧（每垧合十五市亩）土地接种该所研究出的优良菌种，至少可以增产大豆六十万吨。
