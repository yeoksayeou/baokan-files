    【This newspaper dispatch】State-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories, mines, transportation, postal and telecommunications enterprises in the East China region have victoriously completed their 1952 plan to increase production and practice economy, creating 3.5 trillion yuan in wealth for the nation. Many advanced factories, mines, and enterprises have greatly exceeded their original plans for increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the factories and mines under the former East China Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department originally planned to increase production and practice economy by 600 billion yuan, but actually completed over 820 billion yuan; the Shanghai factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau originally targeted 420 billion yuan, but actually completed 750 billion yuan.
    The campaign to increase production and practice economy in East China's factories and mines was carried out on the victorious foundation of democratic reform and the "Three-Anti" movement. Its characteristics were taking the completion and exceeding of production increase and economy practice plans as the goal, implementing production reform as the central content, and promoting advanced experiences and carrying out rationalization proposals as basic links. By October of last year, 80 percent of East China's factories and mines had undergone democratic reform. Through democratic reform and the "Three-Anti" movement, a new atmosphere emerged in the factories and mines, and the consciousness of the working class was greatly enhanced. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, they demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. For example, industrial workers in the seven large and medium-sized cities of Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Zibo, Yantai, Weifang, and Dezhou in Shandong Province put forward 35,000 rationalization proposals in the movement to increase production and practice economy. At the same time, through this movement, the output and quality of various factories and mines were generally improved, waste was reduced, and costs were lowered. For example, the Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong adopted the double-cycle operation method, which increased the tunneling rate by more than 50 percent; the rejection rate of silica bricks manufactured by the Shanghai Kiln Factory was reduced from more than 80 percent to about 10 percent.
    In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the factories and mines in East China also vigorously corrected the serious shortcomings in production management that were exposed during the movement. The factories and mines began to carry out production reforms in June of last year, and first took a major safety and health inspection as a preliminary step in production reform. In Shanghai alone, the employees of the first batch of 183 state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories put forward 460,000 opinions on safety and health; the implementation of these suggestions greatly improved factory safety and health and workers' working conditions. Subsequently, most factories and mines conducted a major democratic inspection of production management. After the inspection, reforms were immediately carried out in management institutions, labor organizations, working hours, and wages. In addition, most factories and mines completed the work of clearing assets and verifying funds in conjunction with the above-mentioned reform tasks, and some state-owned machine factories also carried out verification work.
    The workers and staff of East China's factories and mines are full of confidence in the first Five-Year Plan for national construction, which began in 1953, and are now putting forward specific goals to strive for even greater victories.

    华东完成增产节约三万五千亿元的计划
     【本报讯】华东地区国营、地方国营和公私合营的工厂、矿山、交通、邮电等企业，已胜利完成一九五二年内为国家增产节约三万五千亿元财富的计划。许多先进厂矿、企业单位大大超额完成了原来的增产节约计划。例如前华东军政委员会工业部所属厂矿，原计划增产节约六千亿元，实际完成了八千二百多亿元；华东纺织管理局所属上海各厂原定四千二百亿元，实际完成了七千五百亿元。
    华东各厂矿企业的增产节约运动是在民主改革与“三反”运动胜利基础上进行的。它的特点是以完成和超过增产节约计划为目标，以贯彻生产改革为中心内容，以推行先进经验、开展合理化建议为基本环节。到去年十月份为止，华东厂矿企业经过民主改革的占百分之八十。通过民主改革与“三反”运动，各厂矿企业出现了新的气象，工人阶级觉悟大大提高，在增产节约运动中，发挥了高度的积极性与创造性。例如山东省青岛、济南、徐州、淄博、烟台、潍坊、德州等七个大中城市的产业工人，就在增产节约运动中提出了合理化建议三万五千件。同时通过这一运动，各厂矿企业普遍提高了产量和质量，减少了浪费，降低了成本。如山东洪山煤矿采用双循环作业法，使掘进率提高百分之五十以上；上海窑厂制造矽砖的废品率由百分之八十以上降低到百分之十左右。
    华东区各厂矿企业在增产节约运动中，同时大力纠正在运动中暴露出来的生产管理方面的严重缺点。各厂矿企业曾于去年六月间开始进行生产改革，并首先把安全卫生大检查作为生产改革的先行步骤。仅上海市第一批一百八十三个国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂的职工群众即提出了四十六万条关于安全卫生方面的意见；实行这些建议的结果，大大改善了工厂安全卫生和工人劳动条件。接着，大部厂矿企业进行了生产管理民主大检查。检查后，随即对管理机构、劳动组织、工时与工资进行了改革。此外，大部厂矿企业并结合上述改革任务，完成了清理资产、核定资金工作，部分国营机器厂还进行了查定工作。
    华东各厂矿职工，对一九五三年开始执行国家建设的第一个五年计划，充满着胜利信心，目前正纷纷提出具体的奋斗目标，以争取更大的胜利。
