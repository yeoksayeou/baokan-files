The newly built dormitories for employees of the Jilin Railway Bureau in Huangqitun are of extremely poor quality. This is due to the lack of concern from leading cadres for the lives and welfare of the masses, resulting in careless design and construction. The newly completed houses have inch-thick ice on the windows, and seventy households have been affected by gas poisoning in just over a month.

In 1951, the employees of the Jilin Railway Bureau exceeded the state's transportation tasks. Last June, the administration decided to use enterprise funds to build 496 new dormitory units for employees in Huangqitun. Before the design, the Jilin Railway Bureau sent two technicians to Tianjin to visit the newly built employee dormitories of the Tianjin Railway Bureau. They were very satisfied with what they saw. Upon their return, they did not consider that the winter climate in Huangqitun is below minus 30 degrees Celsius, which is different from the conditions in Tianjin. They simply copied the Tianjin style. After construction began, the construction committee was extremely irresponsible in leading the entire project. Gu Hengxian (Deputy Director of the Jilin Railway Sub-bureau), the director of the construction committee, and Ma Kejin (Engineering Captain of the Jilin Railway Bureau), the deputy director, rarely went to the construction site to inspect the work. They entrusted the entire technical guidance responsibility to Li Hua, the director of the real estate stationed office, who did not understand technology. The construction workers, except for more than 50 bricklayers, were all temporary recruits from various sections and stations, including train attendants, clerks, switchmen, and assistant drivers. Many people did not understand construction technology at all and had not received any prior training. They were only led by an ordinary worker, Liu Chengjin, to build the kang (heated brick bed). As a result, some stove eyes did not match the kang flue openings, and the fire could not enter; some stove smoke went directly into the chimney, and the kang did not get hot; the kang was not plastered around, and the room was full of smoke when burning the kang; some stoves were built, but the kang was not yet built; and some stove eyes and chimney bases were blocked by broken bricks, preventing fire from entering. More than 400 out of 496 households were difficult to heat, and the entire construction period was extended by 64 days, only being completed when it was freezing. During the construction process, the bricklayers suggested that the chimney base should be wrapped with tinplate, otherwise it would leak when the spring snow melted. Li Hua raised this suggestion to Gu Hengxian. Gu Hengxian not only did not accept it but criticized Li Hua for being "conservative," saying: "The Tianjin Railway Bureau did not use it, and we don't need to use it either. We should save where we can!"

After the houses were completed, the employees happily moved into their new homes. Yang Jilu's wife from the Jilin Machinery Plant was extremely happy after receiving her new house and urged her husband to move so that she could give birth to her child in the new house. But the house was poorly designed, the kitchen was inside the bedroom, and there was no way to exhaust the air when cooking, the room was full of hot air, and the walls and roof of the bedroom were covered with thick ice. The day after she gave birth, the sand and soil on the kitchen roof collapsed. In just over a month, the sand and soil on the roofs of eighteen kitchens had collapsed. After Sun Qixiao, a technician from the Engineering Department, received his new house, he wrote a letter to his father, Sun Lianhui, asking him to come and live with him. After his father came, the chimney only emitted sparse smoke every time he burned the kang, and smoke was constantly coming out from around the kang. On December 22nd last year, when Sun Qixiao returned home, he found his father had been poisoned by coal gas and passed out. On that day alone, four families of employees were poisoned. Tao Xikang's family of six was poisoned, and three were unconscious. They only woke up after emergency treatment. On January 4th, Chen Xiang, the wife of the assistant driver of the Jilin Locomotive Depot, was poisoned to death by coal gas. In just over a month, as many as seventy households had been poisoned by coal gas.

Now Huangqitun is in the severe cold season where water turns to ice instantly. The houses built according to the Tianjin style cannot keep out the cold. The outer doors of these houses have no thresholds, the bedrooms and kitchens have no doors, there is no double-layer glass, and cold winds constantly invade. The kitchens and windows are covered with five-tenths to one inch of ice, and the kang walls in the rooms are also covered with thick white frost. The children in the rooms are so cold that their hands and feet are blue and purple, and some have chapped skin. (Nan Yuqing)

    吉林铁路局新建黄旗屯职工宿舍质量极坏
    吉林铁路局新建的黄旗屯职工宿舍，由于领导干部对群众的生活福利不关心，设计和施工都十分草率。新落成的房屋，窗上结冰一寸厚，一个多月中被煤气薰坏了七十户人。
    吉林铁路局的职工在一九五一年内超额完成了国家运输任务，去年六月间，行政上决定用企业基金在黄旗屯新建职工宿舍四百九十六户。在设计前，吉林铁路局派了两名技术员到天津去参观天津铁路局新建的职工宿舍。他们当时看了，觉得很满意。回来后，也没有考虑黄旗屯冬季气候在零下三十多度，和天津的条件不同，便“照葫芦画瓢”，照天津的式样设计了。开始施工后，施工委员会对于整个工程的领导极不负责，施工委员会主任顾恒显（吉林铁路分局副局长），副主任马可进（吉林铁路局工程队长）很少到工地检查工作，把整个工程的技术指导责任交给一个不懂技术的房产驻在所主任李化担负。建筑工人除五十余名瓦工以外，全是各段、站临时抽出来的列车员、事务员、搬道员、副司机等，许多人根本不懂建筑技术，事先也未经过任何训练，仅由一个普通工人刘成金领着大家搭炕。结果有的锅灶眼不对炕洞子眼，火进不去；有的锅灶烟一直跑到烟筒里，炕不热；炕的四周围没有抹灰，烧炕时满屋子烟；也有的锅灶搭起来了，炕还没有搭；还有的锅灶眼和烟筒根被碎砖头堵塞，不进火。四百九十六户有四百多户不好烧，整个施工时间延长了六十四天，到结冻时才完成。在施工过程中，瓦工们建议，烟筒根应包洋铁皮，不然春雪融化时都会漏雨，李化把这意见向顾恒显提出，顾恒显不但没有接受，反而批评李化“保守”说：“天津铁路局没有用，我们也可以不用，能省就省下！”
    房屋落成后，职工们欢欢喜喜地搬进新屋去居住。吉林机械场杨继禄的妻子领到新屋后高兴极了，催着她爱人搬家，好在新屋里生小孩。那知屋子设计不好，厨房在寝室里屋，做饭时没法排气，满屋热气，一冷一热，寝室墙上和屋顶上就结了很厚的冰。当她生小孩的次日，厨房顶上的沙土便塌落了。一个多月中，十八家厨房顶上的沙土都塌了。工务处技术员孙启孝领到新屋后，便写信让他父亲孙连惠一同来住。他父亲来后，每次烧炕时烟筒只是稀稀拉拉地往外冒烟，炕的四周也不时冒烟。去年十二月二十二日，孙启孝回家时，发现父亲已中煤毒晕了过去。当天一天中，就有四户职工全家中毒。陶喜亢一家六人中毒，三人已不省人事，经急救后才醒过来。一月四日，又有吉林机务段副司机陈祥的妻子被煤气薰死。一个多月中，先后中煤毒的竟有七十户之多。
    现在黄旗屯正是滴水成冰的酷寒季节，按照天津式样建造的住宅已不能御寒。这些房子外屋的门没有门坎，寝室和厨房没有门，没有双层玻璃，冷风不断侵入，厨房和窗户上冻起了五分到一寸的冰，住人的炕墙也结了很厚的白霜，室内的小孩子冻得手脚青紫，有的都冻裂了口子。　（南玉庆）
