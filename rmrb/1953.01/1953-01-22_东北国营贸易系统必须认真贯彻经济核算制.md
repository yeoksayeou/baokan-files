    The Northeast State-Owned Trading System Must Seriously Implement Economic Accounting
    By our special correspondent Chen Xin
    Since 1951, state-owned trading enterprises in Northeast China have done some work and achieved certain results in implementing the economic accounting system. However, due to the fact that many trade cadres still have a supply system mentality, and their understanding of the new situation of increasing production and the complexity of trade work is insufficient, the economic accounting system has not been seriously implemented. This has caused many serious shortcomings in the operation and management of the Northeast state-owned trading system.

    First, large quantities of goods are stockpiled, and capital turnover is getting slower and slower. Northeast state-owned trade departments, not based on people's needs but on subjective speculation, blindly carry out procurement or allocation, resulting in a large increase in commodity inventory and a large number of goods being stockpiled. As a result, commercial credit and loans continue to expand, the speed of capital turnover becomes slower and slower, and the commodity turnover period becomes longer and longer. Taking the Northeast Branch of the China Department Store Company as an example, in the third quarter of 1951, the company had an inventory of 900,000 cans of canned goods, which was enough to sell for two years according to the situation at that time. However, the company bought another 279,000 cans from within the customs, and then successively purchased a batch (during the same period, the Northeast Native Products Company also bought a lot from within the customs). Although the price was reduced and sales were vigorously promoted, by September 1952, there were still 1.8 million cans in stock, many of which had deteriorated. There was already a backlog of bicycles produced in Northeast China, but the China Department Store Company allocated another batch to Northeast China, and the Northeast Branch Company bought 12,000 vehicles from Shanghai. After autumn, the climate in Northeast China turned cold, but the Northeast Department Store Company bought a large number of umbrellas, summer cloth and other summer supplies from within the customs. This made unsalable and stockpiled goods account for more than a quarter of the entire inventory. It is particularly worth mentioning that in the vigorous promotion of industrial products in the second quarter, the company's inventory growth rate was actually 60 percent higher than the sales growth rate. The company's goods have been stockpiled for a long time, as can be seen from the survey of 83 major department store varieties: 11 varieties have been stockpiled for less than three months, 26 varieties have been stockpiled for four to six months, and 23 varieties have been stockpiled for seven to twelve months and more than one year, respectively. Therefore, the company's capital increased with the increase of commodity inventory, commercial credit continued to expand, and the capital occupation ratio increased day by day. As a result, the department store system could not repay the bank loans even if all the current inventory was sold. The company's capital turnover rate dropped from 2.8 times in 1950 to 1.51 times in 1952; the commodity turnover period decreased from 130.5 days in 1950 to 242.4 days in 1952.

    Second, commodity circulation costs have increased rather than decreased. Because the Northeast state-owned trade departments did not correctly organize commodity circulation, commodity circulation costs only increased and did not decrease. When the Northeast Branch of the China Department Store Company purchased sugar from Songjiang Province, knitted goods from Dalian City, caustic soda from Heilongjiang Province, and soap, etc., it lost money because it did not take costs into account. The company also blindly allocated commodities such as marine binoculars, dyes, and tram wires to Heilongjiang Province, which is neither coastal, nor has dye factories, nor has trams. In addition, there were also many unnecessary losses in the process of operation and circulation.

    These losses increased the commodity circulation costs of the Northeast state-owned trade departments from 6.15 percent of the commodity circulation volume in the first half of 1951 to 10.88 percent in the first half of 1952; the absolute amount of expenses increased by 125 percent. The proportion of expenses paid for loan interest is very large. For example, the loan interest expenditure of the Northeast Industrial Equipment Company in 1951 was 30 times that of 1950, and in the first half of 1952 it exceeded 38.4 percent of the total interest in 1951, and the interest amount accounted for 53.52 percent of the total circulation expenses.

    Third, many systems are very unreasonable. Many systems of the Northeast state-owned trade departments still follow the practices of the past supply system, especially the financial and accounting management systems are extremely backward, which has affected the implementation of the economic accounting system. The number of allocation levels and the complexity of procedures at the Shenyang Wholesale Station have reached this extent: on May 18, 1952, the wholesale station bought a trainload of stationery from within the customs, and it took until June 8 to complete the warehousing procedures after levels of reconciliation, review, and inventory; on June 6, it was decided to allocate a trainload of stationery, and it took a full 13 days to leave the warehouse after going through allocation, pricing, and other checkpoints. The Northeast state-owned trade departments often experience the phenomenon of goods and invoices not traveling together, goods and prices not traveling together, and each other shirking responsibilities, which delays the circulation time of goods even more. Waste and unreasonable expenditures in financial management, and phenomena that do not conform to economic accounting have not been eliminated for a long time. After the "Three-Anti" campaign, more than 100 violations of financial discipline occurred. The organization of account books and forms in the accounting system are very complex. Some commodity accounts are as long as a table. When bookkeeping, you have to move your seat and use a line ruler to press it down, otherwise it is easy to cross the grid. According to the statistics of 84 units in September 1952, backlog accounts generally ranged from one month to three months. Among them, 82 units had discrepancies between goods and accounts, and discrepancies between accounts. The Liaozhong County Department Store Company operates 1,200 kinds of commodities, and there are discrepancies between goods and accounts or discrepancies between accounts for 1,000 kinds of commodities. This seriously affects the normal circulation of goods.

    The above-mentioned phenomena are not allowed to continue to exist. The Northeast state-owned trade departments have decided to vigorously implement the economic accounting system, improve the organization of commodity circulation, further improve and strengthen the work of wholesale stations, and strengthen and improve financial management.

    1. Actively and systematically clear property, verify the working capital of wholesale stations and grassroots companies, and strictly implement the method of clearing and settling through the state bank, so as to lay the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system. The experience of Northeast China in carrying out property clearing and capital verification in the past has proved that clear property is an important condition for verifying capital, and verifying capital is an indispensable step for implementing economic accounting. Especially in the current situation of unclear property and slower and slower capital turnover, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers and staff to actively and systematically carry out the work of clearing property and verifying capital. According to the current situation of huge inventory, the amount of capital should be changed from wide to strict, the management items should be changed from simple to complex, and the efficiency of use should be changed from low to high. However, it must be done so that it can be "fixed" after "verification", and it must not be "verified" without being fixed, and become a formality again. It is necessary to give play to the enthusiasm of the management of trade departments at all levels, use capital reasonably, and expand and accelerate capital turnover through the work of verifying capital. At the same time, it must be clearly recognized that the work of verifying capital is one of the conditions for expanding sales and accurately carrying out procurement. It is necessary to prevent the conservative thinking of not daring to ask for goods after verifying capital, and criticize the idea of ​​simply buying and selling good and fast goods.

    2. Further implement quota management. Quota management is a powerful weapon to promote all employees to clarify their goals, improve and improve their work. We must regard it as the most important content of economic accounting. This year, the department store retail stores along the railway in Northeast China must turn over their funds once a month (including the quota for commodity inventory and the sales quota for different commodities and different regions). Commodity circulation costs should be reduced by another 15 to 20 percent on the basis of 1952 (including equipment consumption, commodity losses, and the storage quota per "vehicle unit" area in warehouses and freight yards, etc.). The rate of profit turned over to the state should be increased by more than 40 percent. These main quotas must be mobilized by the masses to ensure their realization. To this end, it is also necessary to promote several key advanced experiences. In terms of rational use of funds, after clearing property and verifying funds, Zhenlai County, Heilongjiang Province, insisted on financial planning, maintained close contact with all parties, improved settlement procedures, rationally used funds, and accelerated the speed of capital turnover. These methods should be studied and improved, and then promoted. In terms of transportation, we should promote the advanced experience of the Northeast Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company in implementing "regional rational transportation" based on the principle of local production and sales, with mines and forest farms as the center; we should promote the Northeast Department Store Company to implement one-time direct transportation of major commodities, and zero-load consolidation and distribution of small commodities, and improve the technical loading capacity of cotton cloth, rubber shoes, etc. In terms of warehouse management, we should promote the responsibility system of the Northeast Trade Department's first warehouse for commodity zoning, classification, and special personnel for special items, and the quota management system for rational use of capital and materials, improving the storage capacity per "vehicle unit" area, ensuring commodity quality, reducing commodity losses, and improving work efficiency, as well as the advanced experience of establishing a contact responsibility system in the form of contracts for all links inside and outside the warehouse to shorten the time of commodities in the warehouse. In terms of the operation and management of stores, we should promote the advanced experience of the Liu Shuzhen sales group of the No. 2 store of the Shenyang Department Store Company in strengthening ideological leadership, improving political quality, implementing fixed personnel and quota systems and bonus systems for excess wages, simplifying business procedures, implementing pre-packaging, counter quotas, shortage registration, and developing fixed customers, improving work efficiency, and ensuring the monthly and quarterly completion of commodity circulation plans. Undoubtedly, if these advanced experiences are promoted, the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff in each work post will be brought into play, the quotas will be realized, and a great impetus will be given to the further implementation of the economic accounting system.

    3. Improve financial management, strengthen system construction, and do a good job in the contact responsibility system. There are two tasks that must be done well in current financial management: one is to establish and improve financial institutions, strengthen full-time responsibilities, improve settlement work, strive to implement the method of paying bills of exchange, expand the collection and settlement system, eliminate the wasteful method of remitting funds before or after remittance, constantly expand the proportion of working capital (including commodity funds), save funds, and gradually eliminate commercial credit. One is to try to improve accounting work as much as possible through the work of verifying capital and the accounting final accounts in 1952 (we should vigorously promote the "retail price accounting method" and the experience of the "commodity retail card" implemented by the No. 2 store of the Shenyang Department Store Company based on advanced Soviet experience), to ensure the control effect of accounting work on the capital of business departments and the supervision role of enterprises. This is the key to correct management after verifying capital. In addition, we should conscientiously establish a regular inspection system, implement a manager fund system on the basis of determining quotas, and gradually implement an expense fund and labor wage fund system; vigorously advocate the establishment of a contact responsibility system based on the "special responsibility system" in the seven links of procurement, allocation, transportation, storage, pricing, settlement, and sales. This is a key issue to ensure the accelerated circulation of commodities and the accumulation of funds.

    In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, trade departments in various parts of Northeast China have begun to expose various wasteful, unreasonable, and non-economic accounting principles in the Northeast state-owned trade work in the form of capital complaints, commodity complaints, etc., and mobilize employees to calculate their losses, so that all employees can understand the role of implementing economic accounting in national economic construction and the correct implementation of policies, in order to systematically solve various problems in management in an organized, planned, and systematic way, ensure the completion and over-completion of commodity circulation plans, and complete the tasks of accelerating commodity turnover, reducing commodity costs, and rationally accumulating funds.

    东北国营贸易系统必须认真贯彻经济核算制
  　本报特约记者　陈新
    东北国营贸易企业自一九五一年开始，在贯彻经济核算制方面曾经作了若干工作，也取得了一定的成绩。但是由于不少贸易干部还有供给制思想，对于生产日益发展的新情况及贸易工作的复杂性认识不足，经济核算制还没有认真贯彻，这就造成了东北国营贸易系统的经营管理工作中许多严重的缺点。
    首先是，大批商品被积压，资金越转越慢。东北国营贸易部门不是根据人民需要而是依据主观臆测，盲目进行采购或调拨，结果使商品库存大量增加，大批商品被积压起来。因此，商业信用及信贷不断膨胀，资金周转速度越来越慢，商品周转日期越来越长。以中国百货公司东北区公司为例，一九五一年第三季度，该公司库存罐头有九十万筒，按当时情况够卖两年。但该公司又从关内买入二十七万九千筒，后来又陆续采购了一批（同一时期，东北土产公司也在关内买了很多）。虽然经过减价和大力销售，到一九五二年九月份，还积压了一百八十万筒；其中有不少已经变质。东北区生产的自行车已有积压，中国百货公司又拨到东北一批，而东北区公司又从上海买进一万二千辆。入秋以后，东北气候转冷，东北百货公司却从关内买进大批雨伞、夏布等夏季用品。这就使滞销品和积压品占了整个库存的四分之一还多。特别值得提出的是：在第二季度大力推销工业品运动中，该公司库存增长速度竟还比销售增长速度大百分之六十。该公司商品积压时间很长，这从八十三种主要百货品种的调查中可以看出来：积压三个月以下者有十一种，积压四至六个月者有二十六种，积压七至十二个月和一年以上者各有二十三种。因此，该公司的资金随着商品库存的增加而增加，商业信用不断扩大，资金占用比率日益提高，结果，百货系统把现在库存商品全部卖光还不够偿还银行信贷额数。该公司资金周转率由一九五○年的二点八次降低到一九五二年的一点五一次；商品周转期则由一九五○年的一三○·五天周转一次，降低到一九五二年的二四二·四天周转一次。
    其次是商品流转费用有增无减。东北国营贸易部门因为没有正确地组织商品流转，商品流转费用只见增加，不见减少。中国百货公司东北区公司采购松江省的砂糖、旅大市的针织品、黑龙江省的火碱以及香皂等物品时，由于不计成本，结果都要赔钱。该公司还曾把海上用的望远镜、染料和电车线等商品，盲目拨给既不靠海、也无染厂、更无电车的黑龙江省。另外，在经营、运转过程中许多不应有的损失，也是非常多的。
    这种种损失，使东北国营贸易部门的商品流转费用由一九五一年上半年占商品流转额的百分之六点一五，上升到一九五二年上半年的百分之十点八八；绝对费用数量则增加了百分之一二五。其中支付信贷利息的费用所占比重很大。如东北工业器材公司信贷利息支出，一九五一年为一九五○年的三十倍，而一九五二年上半年竟超过一九五一年全年利息的百分之三十八点四，利息额竟占全部流转费用的百分之五十三点五二。
    第三，许多制度很不合理。东北国营贸易部门的许多制度，还沿袭着过去供给制的作法，尤其是财务和会计管理制度异常落后，影响了经济核算制的贯彻。沈阳批发站调拨层次之多和手续的复杂，竟达到了这样的程度：一九五二年五月十八日该批发站从关内买入一车皮文具，经过对账、复核、清点等层次，到六月八日才办好入库手续；六月六日决定拨出一车皮文具，经过调拨、作价等关口，整整化费了十三天时间才出了库。东北国营贸易部门经常发生货票不同行、货价不同行和彼此推诿的现象，更多地耽误了商品流转的时间。财务管理中的浪费、不合理的支出、不合经济核算的现象，长期没有消除，“三反”后还发生了百余件违犯财政纪律的事情。会计制度中的账簿组织及表格等非常复杂。有些商品账有一张桌子长，记账时要挪动坐位，并要用划线尺压好，否则就容易串格。据一九五二年九月份八十四个单位的统计，积压账目普遍达一个月到三个月。其中货账不符、账账不符的达八十二个单位。辽中县百货公司经营一千二百种商品，有一千种商品货账不符或账账不符。这样就严重影响了商品的正常流转。
    上述种种现象是不容许继续存在的。东北国营贸易部门已确定大力贯彻经济核算制，改进商品流转组织，进一步改进和加强批发站的工作，并且加强和改进财务管理工作。
    一、积极地有步骤地清理财产，核定批发站与基层公司的流动资金，严格实行通过国家银行划拨清算的办法，以便为贯彻经济核算制奠定基础。东北过去进行清理财产、核定资金工作的经验证明：财产清楚是核定资金的重要条件，核定资金是贯彻经济核算必不可缺的步骤。特别是在目前财产不清、资金周转越来越慢的情况下，必须发动广大职工积极地有步骤地进行清理财产、核定资金的工作。根据目前库存庞大的实际情况，在资金数量上应由宽到严，在管理项目上由简到繁，在使用效率上由低到高。但必须作到“核”后能“定”，决不能“核”后而不固定，再度流于形式。必须通过核定资金工作发挥各级贸易部门的经营积极性，合理使用资金，扩大和加速资金周转。同时必须明确认识：核定资金工作是扩大推销、准确进行采购的条件之一，要防止核定资金后发生不敢要货的保守思想，批判单纯买卖好货和快货的思想。
    二、进一步实行定额管理。定额管理是推动全体职工明确奋斗目标、改进和提高工作的有力武器。我们必须把它当作经济核算的最重要的内容。今年东北区靠铁路沿线的百货零售商店，资金每月要周转一次（包括商品存库定额和不同商品、不同地区的商品销售定额）。商品流转费用要在一九五二年的基础上再降低百分之十五至二十（包括器材消耗、商品损耗以及仓库、货场“车单位”面积保管量定额等）。上交利润率应再提高百分之四十以上。这几项主要定额，必须发动群众保证实现。为此，又必须推广几个关键性的先进经验。在合理使用资金方面，黑龙江省镇赉县清理财产、核定资金后，坚持了财务计划，与各方面密切联系，改进结算手续，合理使用资金，加速了资金周转速度。这些办法应该加以研究改进，然后推广。在运输方面，应该推广东北煤业建筑器材公司以矿山、林场为中心，按就地产销原则实行“分区合理运输”的先进经验；应该推广东北百货公司的大宗主要商品实行一次直达运输，零星商品实行零担装整车、中转分运，提高棉布、胶鞋等技术装载量等先进经验。在仓库管理方面，应该推广东北贸易部直属第一仓库的商品分区、分类、专人专物保管的责任制度，和合理使用资财、提高“车单位”面积保管量，保证商品质量，降低商品损耗，提高工作效率的定额管理制度，以及仓库内外各环节以合同形式建立起来的联系责任制度，以缩短商品在库时间的先进经验。在商店的经营管理方面，应该推广沈阳百货公司第二商店刘漱珍卖货小组的加强思想领导、提高政治素质、实行定员定额和超额工资奖励制，简化业务手续，实行预先包装、柜台定额、缺货登记以及发展固定用户、提高工作效率、保证月月、季季超额完成商品流转计划的先进经验。无疑问的，如果推广了这些先进经验，就会发挥每个工作岗位上的工作人员的积极性和创造性，实现定额，并对进一步贯彻经济核算制起很大的推动作用。
    三、改进财务管理，加强制度建设，搞好联系责任制。当前财务管理中有两个工作必须作好：一个是建立与健全财务机构，加强专职专责，改进结算工作，争取实行押汇货款办法，扩大托收结算制，消灭先汇款或后汇款的大量浪费资金的汇款办法，不断扩大流动资金比重（包括商品资金），节约资金，并逐步消灭商业信用。一个是通过核定资金工作和一九五二年会计决算，尽量设法改进会计工作
     （应大力推广“售价记账法”以及沈阳百货公司第二商店根据苏联先进经验实行的“商品零售卡片”的经验），保证会计工作对业务部门资金的控制作用和对企业的监督作用。这是核定资金后正确进行经营管理的关键。此外，应该认真建立经常的检查制度，在确定定额的基础上，实行经理基金制度，逐步地实行经费基金和劳动工薪基金制度；大力提倡建立在采购、调拨、运输、保管、作价、结算、销售七个环节的“专责制”基础上的联系责任制。这是保证商品加速流转和积累资金的关键性的问题。
    为了达到上述目的，东北各地贸易部门已开始以资金告状、商品控诉等形式，揭发和暴露东北国营贸易工作中的各种浪费和不合理、不合经济核算原则的现象，并发动职工计算其损失，以便使全体职工认识贯彻经济核算对国家经济建设和正确执行政策的作用，以便有组织有计划有系统地来解决经营管理中的各种问题，保证完成并超额完成商品流转计划，完成加速商品周转、降低商品成本、合理积累资金的任务。
