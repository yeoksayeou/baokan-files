    Book Supply on the Korean Front
    Ming Wu, Fang Ai
    Since December 1950, the "Battlefield Cultural Service Team" active on the Korean front has delivered more than 6.9 million books donated by the people of the motherland to the hands of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. "Front Library," "Trench Library," "Company Library," "Headquarters Library," "Hospital Library"... have been widely established in various units of the Volunteer Army.
    The "Battlefield Cultural Service Team" is composed of employees from Xinhua Bookstore, International Bookstore, and China Book Distribution Company. Initially, they were just a small team of a dozen people, each carrying hundreds of books, conducting mobile exhibitions in various companies of the Volunteer Army. In March 1951, the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea and Xinhua Bookstore launched a campaign to raise books and periodicals for the Volunteer Army, which received enthusiastic responses from the people across the country. By the end of July of the same year, more than five million books and periodicals had been raised. To transport these books and periodicals to the front line, the "Battlefield Cultural Service Team" expanded its organization and, under the leadership of the political departments of the Volunteer Army, assisted various units in establishing company libraries. This work was extremely arduous. They had to transport books from the motherland to the Korean front, and had to wage a heroic struggle against the American air pirates. One comrade from the service team gloriously sacrificed his life.
    When a large number of books arrived at the front, they also had to be sorted out after the long-distance transportation, and then distributed to each company set by set. Once, transporting books from a certain division to a company required traveling more than twenty li of winding paths. It was snowing heavily at the time, and five comrades from the service team took turns pushing a handcart full of books, pushing it over those rugged field ridges and mountain roads that could only pass a small car. The snow on the ground was more than a foot thick, making it impossible to distinguish between fields and roads. They overturned the cart five or six times on the way. There was a small river on the road, and the bridge over the river was only a small bridge made of two logs. They took off their shoes and socks, jumped into the icy water, and pushed the cart across. Millions of books were distributed to the trenches and camps of the Volunteer Army again and again in this way.
    After the books arrived at the company, they were warmly welcomed by the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army everywhere. When a certain company established a library, the soldiers spent two days digging a large cave, with the three large yellow characters "Library" written on red paper at the entrance, and a couplet hanging on both sides: "Good soldiers are wise and brave," "Volunteer Army is both civil and military." The publicly agreed library rules were posted at the entrance. Inside the cave, slogans, propaganda paintings, maps, etc. were posted all around, and pictorials and newspapers were hung. The soldiers arranged the books neatly. When the library opened, one person from each platoon was selected to take turns managing the book lending work. Each squad formed a reading group, with the literate reading to the illiterate. A special column was opened on the wall newspaper, regularly announcing the number of books borrowed and the number of collective readings in each class, and commending comrades who studied well.
    Whether on the front lines or in the rear of Korea, soldiers would go to the "library" to borrow books to read whenever they had time during battles, construction, training, and production. In the trenches on the front line, in places where there was light at the entrance of the tunnel and where there were lamps in the tunnel, soldiers could often be seen gathering together to read. Many soldiers sewed a pocket out of old cloth, filled it with books and hung it on their waists, and took it out to read whenever they had time. Many tunnel entrances had rows of nails nailed to the walls, and the soldiers punched a hole in the upper right corner of the books, threaded a rope through it, and hung it there for everyone to read. Many places were filled with bookshelves made by the soldiers themselves. A quick-rhythm rhyme circulated on the front line:
    Airplanes buzzing in the sky, artillery booming down the mountain.
    Heroes guarding the tunnel entrance, using books to study hard.
    Squeezing in time to learn culture, learning skills to kill the enemy.
    This is the heroic nature of our culture-loving soldiers.
    The soldiers cherish the books sent by the people of the motherland as they cherish their weapons. Many book covers are pasted with small slogans written by the soldiers themselves: "Everyone is responsible for cherishing books, do not lose them, do not damage them." Some books were worn out because too many people read them, so the soldiers covered them with thick old newspapers and wrote on them: "See if you can get any worse!" Guo, the political commissar of a certain division, said: "Books are the hearts of the people of the motherland, and we must respond to the care of the people of the motherland with good study and love for books." A certain company on the front line established an "unmanned library" where commanders and fighters borrowed and returned books themselves and registered themselves. The order was very good for three months. Only three small books were lost, and each squad conducted a deep self-criticism for this incident.
    The books and periodicals that arrived at the front not only enriched the spiritual lives of the soldiers, but also inspired their fighting will. The soldiers were very happy to see the books and pictures. When they received a book, they would first read the consolation words on the book, and at the same time read aloud the names of the donors. The soldiers liked to read comic strips and heroic stories in the newspapers the most, and they loved to read about the construction of the motherland and the records of the happy lives of the people. Comrade Wang Fubin of a certain company was illiterate, but during rest, he always took comic strips and asked literate comrades to read them to him. He read the books "Liu Hulan" and "People's Hero Hu Duo" in two days. Comrade Huang Bicai of a certain company said after reading the comic strip "Flying Capture of Luding Bridge": "In such difficult circumstances, the Red Army still defeated the enemy. Now we are much better than then. We should learn from those heroes and fiercely strike the American devils." Xiao Huixing, a young soldier from a certain company, after watching the movie story "Steel Warrior," asked to join the assault team twice in a counterattack. He said: "I want to learn from the example of Xiao Liu in 'Steel Warrior.'"
    Recently, due to the complete stabilization of the war situation and the development of accelerated literacy learning, the atmosphere of reading in the Volunteer Army has become even stronger. Under the leadership of the political departments of the Volunteer Army, the "Battlefield Cultural Service Team" is assisting various units in consolidating and enriching libraries, and constantly summarizing experiences, improving work, and cooperating with the cultural learning movement to further improve the book supply work on the Korean front.

    图书供应在朝鲜前线
    明武、方艾
    从一九五○年十二月以来，活跃在朝鲜前线的“战地文化服务队”把祖国人民支援志愿军的六百九十多万册图书送到了指战员们的手里。“阵地图书馆”、“战壕图书馆”、“连队图书馆”、“机关图书馆”、“医院图书馆”……普遍地在志愿军各部队建立起来了。
    “战地文化服务队”是由新华书店、国际书店和中国图书发行公司的职工组成的。最初，他们只有十几个人组成的一个小队，每人背着几百本书，分头在志愿军各个连队进行流动展览。一九五一年三月，抗美援朝总会和新华书店发起了为志愿军募集书刊的运动，得到了全国人民的热烈响应，到同年七月末，募集的书刊已达五百余万册。为了把这些书刊运抵前线，“战地文化服务队”扩大了组织，在志愿军政治部门的领导下，协助各部队普遍地建立连队图书馆。这个工作是异常艰巨的。他们要从祖国把图书运到朝鲜前线，要和美国空中强盗作英勇的斗争。服务队有一个同志光荣地牺牲了。
    当大量书籍到达前线后，还要把经过长途运输弄得凌乱了的加以整理，再一套一套地分送各个连队。有一次，从某师把图书运到连队去，要经过二十多里的羊肠小道。那时正下着大雪，服务队的五个同志，轮流地推着一辆装满书籍的手推车，推过那些仅仅能通过一辆小车的崎岖田埂和山路。地上积雪有一尺多厚，分不清田和路，他们在路上翻了五六次车。路上有一条小河，河上只有一道用两根木头搭成的小桥。他们就脱下鞋袜，跳进冰水里把小车推了过去。几百万册图书，就是这样一次又一次地分送到志愿军的各处战壕和营地去的。
    图书到达连队后，到处受到志愿军指战员的热烈欢迎。某连在建立图书馆的时候，战士们用两天工夫挖了一个大洞子，洞口贴着红纸写的“图书馆”三个大黄字，两旁挂着幅对联：“好战士智勇兼备”、“志愿军文武双全”。洞口贴着公议的图书馆规则。洞内周围贴着标语、宣传画、地图等，挂着画报和报纸。战士们把图书安置得整整齐齐。开馆时，由各排选一人轮流管理借书工作。各班都成立了阅读小组，由识字的读给不识字的听。墙报上专辟一栏，经常公布各班借书册数和集体阅读次数，并表扬学习好的同志。
    不论在朝鲜的前线和后方，战士们在战斗、修工事、练兵和生产的空隙中，一有时间就到“图书馆”去借书来读。前线上坑道口有光的地方和坑道里有灯的处所，经常能看到战士们聚在一块阅读。许多战士用旧布缝一个口袋，里面装着书本挂在腰上，一有空就拿出来看。许多坑道口两壁钉着一排一排的钉子，战士们把图书的右上角钉一个洞，穿上一根绳子，把它挂在那儿供大家读。许多地方摆着战士们自己做的书架。前线上流传着这样一首快板：
    天上飞机嗡嗡嗡，山下大炮咚咚咚。
    英雄守在坑道口，手拿书本来用功。
    抽空挤空学文化，学好本领杀敌人。
    这就是我们的热爱文化的战士们的英雄本色。
    战士们像爱护武器一样热爱祖国人民送去的图书。许多书皮上都贴着战士们自己写的小标语：“爱护图书人人有责，不得遗失，不得损坏。”有的书看的人太多，书皮磨坏了，战士们就用旧报纸糊得厚厚的，还在上面写着：“看你再坏！”某师的郭政委说：“书就是祖国人民的心，要用好好学习，爱护图书来回答祖国人民的关怀。”前线某连成立了一个“无人图书馆”，指战员借书自取自还，自己登记，三个月中秩序很好，只丢失了三本小书，各班还为了这件事作了深刻检讨。
    书刊到了前线，不但调剂了战士们的精神生活，而且鼓舞了战士们的战斗意志。战士们看到图书和图片都十分高兴。拿到一本书，他们都首先要看书籍上的慰问词，同时高声念着捐献者的姓名。战士们最喜欢看的是连环画和报上的英雄故事，更爱看祖国的各种建设和人民幸福生活的记载。某连王富斌同志不识字，但每在休息时总拿着连环画找识字同志念给他听，两天中就读了“刘胡兰”和“人民英雄胡铎”两本书。某连黄比才同志看了“飞夺泸定桥”连环画后说：“在那样艰苦的情况下，红军还打败了敌人，现在我们比那时好的多啦，我们应该向那些英雄们学习，狠狠地打击美国鬼子。”某连的年轻战士萧会兴看了电影故事“钢铁战士”以后，在一次反击战中两次要求参加突击组。他说：“我要学习‘钢铁战士’中小刘的榜样。”
    最近，由于战局的完全稳定，和速成识字学习的开展，志愿军部队里的读书空气更浓厚了。“战地文化服务队”在志愿军政治部门的领导下，正在协助各部队巩固和充实图书馆，并不断地总结经验，改进工作，配合文化学习运动，把朝鲜前线的图书供应工作进一步做好。
