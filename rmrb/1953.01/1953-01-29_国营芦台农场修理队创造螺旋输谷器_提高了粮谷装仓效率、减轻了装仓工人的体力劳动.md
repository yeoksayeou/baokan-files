    State-Run Lutai Farm Repair Team Creates Spiral Grain Conveyor
    Improves Grain Storage Efficiency and Reduces Physical Labor for Storage Workers
    Workers in the state-run Lutai Farm repair team, under conditions of exceptionally simple equipment and tools, collectively created a new type of grain loading machine – the spiral grain conveyor. This grain loading machine can load 40,000 jin of grain per hour. This is a major invention in grain storage machinery, solving a long-standing difficult problem in the grain storage work of China’s grain professional institutions.
    Lutai Farm produced more than 7.6 million jin of rice in 1952. Such a huge quantity of rice, if loaded into storage by manpower, would require first loading the grain into sacks, then workers climbing onto a plank more than 15 feet high to load it into the warehouse. This not only required a lot of time and manpower, but also was prone to dangerous accidents during transport. After more than three months of active research, all the employees of the farm's repair team finally collectively created China's first newest grain loading machine – the spiral grain conveyor. This creation not only greatly improved the efficiency of grain loading, but also ensured the safety of the storage workers and reduced the labor intensity of the storage workers.
    This conveyor weighs about 400 kilograms and can be moved freely by four people on ordinary flat ground. The conveying tube has a diameter of eight inches and a total length of twenty-nine feet. This machine is highly efficient. When in use, starting a five-horsepower motor and equipping it with six workers (one person operating the machine, one person leveling the grain in the storage, and four people unloading the grain near the machine), on average 42,000 jin of rice can be transported to a 22-foot high storage warehouse per hour. If it works eight hours a day, it can load 336,000 jin. Compared with the manual method of entering the warehouse (calculated at 1,000 jin per person per hour), it saves 36 workers. In addition, it can also reduce the cost of using sacks, planks, etc.
    Many grain professional institutions in Tianjin and other places, after learning about this creation of the farm, have requested drawings from the farm, preparing to imitate it.
    When the employees of the Lutai Farm repair team were trial-producing this grain loading machine, they received great encouragement and support from the farm director Li Zhi and the farm's trade union. Xu Jianlin, the deputy captain of the repair team, and technician Miao Fenggang, actively led everyone in the trial production, responsible for solving technical difficulties. These conditions played a major role in the success of this creation.
    Lutai Farm does not have senior mechanical engineering technicians or dedicated designers, and the repair team's equipment is also very simple. They only have an eight-foot lathe and simple electric welding machines, hand drills and furnace tools. In the trial production process, they encountered many difficulties. However, thanks to the continuous encouragement and help from the leadership, the employees' enthusiasm for research was very high, and they finally overcame numerous difficulties and achieved success.
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government attaches great importance to this creation. In order to give play to the workers' creative enthusiasm and reward creations and inventions, in addition to instructing the State-Run Farm Administration Bureau to conduct an investigation and summary of this creation and issue a circular of commendation, it has reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council's technical management agency to review and award a prize in accordance with the regulations on rewarding creations and inventions.

    国营芦台农场修理队创造螺旋输谷器
    提高了粮谷装仓效率、减轻了装仓工人的体力劳动
    国营芦台农场修理队工人在设备工具异常简陋的情况下，集体创造了一种新型装仓机——螺旋输谷器。这种装仓机每小时可装四万斤粮食。这是仓贮机具上的一个重大发明，解决了我国粮食专业机构仓贮工作中长久存在的一个困难问题。
    芦台农场一九五二年生产了七百六十余万斤稻谷。这样庞大数量的稻谷，如果用人力装仓，必须先把粮谷装入麻袋，再由工人爬上一丈五尺多高的跳板，装进仓内。这不仅需要大量的时间和人力，而且在搬运中也容易发生危险事故。该场修理队全体职工经过三个多月的积极钻研，终于集体创造了我国第一架最新的装仓机器——螺旋输谷器。这一创造不仅大大提高了粮谷装仓的效率，而且保证了装仓工人的安全，减轻了装仓工人的劳动强度。
    这种输谷器全重约四百公斤，在一般平地上四个人就可自由移动。输送筒直径八吋，全长二十九呎。这种机器的效率很高。使用时，开动五匹马力的电动机，再配备六个工人（一人操纵机器，一人在囤内整粮，四人向机器附近卸粮），平均每小时可把四万二千斤稻谷输送到二十二呎高的仓囤内，如每天工作八小时，可装三十三万六千斤。比用人工入囤的办法（按每人每小时入囤一千斤计算）节省人工三十六个。另外，还可以减少使用麻袋、跳板等的费用。
    天津等地许多粮食专业机构知道了该场的这一创造后，已向该场索取图样，准备仿制。
    芦台农场修理队的职工在试制这种装仓机时，得到农场场长李直和该场工会很大的鼓励和支持。修理队副队长徐建霖、技工苗凤刚等积极带领大家试制，负责解决技术上的困难。这些条件，对于这一创造的成功起了很大的作用。
    芦台农场没有高级机务技术人员和专责设计人员，修理队的设备也很简陋。他们仅有一台八呎车床和简单的电焊机、手摇钻和炉房工具。在试制过程中，曾经遇到许多困难。但是由于领导方面不断地给职工们以鼓励和帮助，职工们的钻研热情很高，终于克服了重重困难，获得成功。
    中央人民政府农业部很重视这一创造。该部为了发挥工人创造热情，奖励创造发明，除已指示国营农场管理局对这一创造进行了调查总结并通报表扬外，已报请政务院财政经济委员会技术管理机构依照创造发明奖励办法审查给奖。 （柳培良、李春桂）
