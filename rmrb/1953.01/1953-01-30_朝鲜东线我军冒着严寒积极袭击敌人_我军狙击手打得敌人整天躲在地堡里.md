    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 28th – Our correspondent on the Eastern Front reports: On the Eastern Front of Korea, where the mountains are high and the snow is deep, the Korean and Chinese People’s forces continue to actively attack the enemy's forward positions despite the severe cold.

    On the night of January 13th, tense gunfire suddenly erupted on an unnamed height west of Mundengli, occupied by enemy forces. A night raid team from our army appeared behind the enemy. In an instant, the mountain was filled with warriors wearing white camouflage. Shouts, bugle calls, and battle cries rang out. Enemies who were still sleeping were killed before they could even put on their clothes. Some enemies, huddled in bunkers warming themselves by the fire, scurried to the front of the mountain, while enemies in the fortifications in front of the mountain ran to the rear. It turned out that another night raid team from our army had broken through four rows of barbed wire from the enemy's front and charged up. In the trenches, the enemies stumbled over the bodies of their comrades, running east and west. Many steel helmets dropped there were kicked around with clanging sounds. Finally, the remaining enemies, who stubbornly resisted in a small trench, were all killed by the night raid team's warriors with submachine guns and grenades. The entire battle lasted only a dozen minutes. All the enemy's bunkers on the mountain were blown to smithereens by our army, and two reinforced platoons of the defending enemy were completely annihilated. The enemy forces hiding in the main positions only fired flares and blindly shot outwards from their fortifications but did not dare to come out to rescue their comrades.

    On the same night, another night raid team from our army also attacked an enemy forward position nearby—the unnamed height northeast of Height 974, eliminating more than a squad of enemy soldiers. The few enemy soldiers who managed to escape suffered severe casualties under the interception of our artillery fire.

    Before dawn, the two night raid teams from our army carried the two captured light machine guns and more than a dozen automatic rifles back to their own positions. Comrades had already lit charcoal fires in the tunnels and cooked hot noodle soup to welcome the victorious warriors.

    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th – A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Eastern Front of Korea is actively carrying out sniper operations, keeping the enemy hiding in bunkers all day long, unable to see the sun. Our soldiers humorously call this "putting the enemy in solitary confinement."

    Our soldiers have completely figured out the enemy's activity patterns. Now, the enemy gets hit as soon as they move. One evening, a small squad of enemy soldiers coming to the front line to change shifts was walking up the ridge. Our soldier Zhang Qiming's machine gun "da-da-da" sounded, immediately knocking down four enemies. The rest of the enemies hurriedly ran behind the ridge to hide. Zhang Qiming immediately notified our artillery to fire. After a few "dong-dong" shots, the observer reported: "Our curved artillery fire has killed and wounded another eighteen enemy soldiers."

    The enemies in front of Fish Hidden Mountain have breakfast at eight o'clock in the morning. The signal for breakfast is three gunshots. Our gunners were ready to fire before eight o'clock, waiting for the three gunshots to open fire, preventing the enemy from even getting their food. Later, the enemy dared not fire guns before breakfast, nor did they dare to have breakfast on time. Sometimes they had breakfast before dawn, and sometimes they didn't eat dinner until midnight.

    The snipers' shooting is becoming more and more accurate. The bullets they fire always accurately penetrate the enemy's back and chest. They have the following couplet posted at the entrance of their fortifications: "Hunters guard the mountain, beasts have nowhere to hide; Enter my fire net, and see the King of Hell!" One company killed and wounded one hundred and forty American devils in less than half a month.

    The activities of our snipers are causing the enemy on the front line a lot of headaches. A captured enemy soldier said that they were being "confined" in bunkers, unable to see the sun all winter, and were almost going crazy.

    At night, the enemy is also frightened and uneasy, fearing attacks from our army. Sometimes, a rock rolls down the mountain, and they fire their guns and artillery non-stop. Once, an owl "hoo-hooed," and the enemy thought it was the signal of our assault team, firing their guns and artillery together, driving the owl away. After a while, the owl flew back, and the enemies, living in fear, started firing again.

    朝鲜东线我军冒着严寒积极袭击敌人
    我军狙击手打得敌人整天躲在地堡里
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】本社东线记者报道：在朝鲜山高雪深的东部战线，朝中人民部队继续冒着严寒积极袭击敌军前沿阵地。
    一月十三日深夜，文登里以西敌军盘据的一个无名高地上突然响起了紧张的枪声，我军一支夜袭队在敌人的背后出现了，瞬息间山上布满了穿着白色伪装衣的勇士，一时哨声、喇叭声和喊杀声响成一片。还在睡觉的敌人连衣服也来不及穿就被打死了。一部分蜷缩在地堡里烤火的敌人吓得慌忙往山前跑，而山前工事里的敌人却向山后跑。原来是我军另一路夜袭队又从敌人正面冲过四道铁丝网打上来了，敌人在交通壕里踏着他们同伴的尸体东跑西窜，掉在那里的许多钢盔被踢得叮叮当当地乱滚。最后，挤在一条小交通壕里进行顽抗的残敌，被夜袭队的勇士们用冲锋枪和手雷全部打死了。这场战斗只打了十几分钟，山上敌人的地堡全部被我军炸得稀烂，守敌两个加强班也被我军全部歼灭。当时躲在主阵地上的敌军，只在工事里不断往外打照明弹和盲目射击，却不敢出来救援他们的伙伴。
    在同一天夜里，我军另一支夜袭队也攻上了附近的一个敌军前沿阵地——九七四高地东北无名高地，消灭敌军一个多班。少数侥幸漏网的敌人在我军炮火的截击下受到了严重杀伤。
    天还未明，我军两支夜袭队扛着缴获的两挺轻机枪和十几支自动步枪回到了自己的阵地上。战友们早已在坑道里生好炭火、煮好热热的面汤欢迎得胜归来的勇士们。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】朝鲜东部战线中国人民志愿军某部积极开展狙击活动，打得敌人整天躲在地堡里见不到太阳，我军战士们幽默地把这叫做“关敌人的禁闭”。
    我军战士们已经完全摸熟了敌人活动的规律，敌人现在是一活动就挨打。一天黄昏，一小队到前沿阵地来换防的敌人，正往山梁上走。我军战士张岂明的机枪便“哒哒哒”地响了起来，一下子就打倒四个敌人。其余的敌人慌忙跑到山梁后面躲起来。张岂明又立即通知我军炮兵射击。“咚咚”几炮以后，观测员报告：“我曲射炮火又打死打伤敌军十八名”。
    鱼隐山前的敌人是早晨八点开饭，开饭的信号是放三枪。我们的炮手早在八点钟以前就做好了射击准备，单等三声枪响后就开炮，打得敌人饭也送不上来。以后，敌人不敢在开饭前放枪了，也不敢按时开饭。他们有时天不亮就开早饭，有时到半夜才吃上晚饭。
    狙击手们的射击越来越准确了。他们发出的枪弹，总是准确地穿透敌人的背脊和胸膛。他们在自己的工事门口贴着这样的对联：“猎手镇山岗，兽兵无处藏；进入我火网，叫它见阎王！”有一个连在不到半个月的时间内就打死打伤了一百四十个美国鬼子。
    我军狙击手们的活动，使前沿的敌人非常伤脑筋。一个被俘的敌军士兵说，他们被“关禁闭”在地堡里，一冬都看不到太阳，都快蹩死了。
    敌人在夜里，害怕我军的袭击，也是心惊肉跳，惶惶不安。有时，山头上滚下一块石头，他们也要用枪炮打个不停。一次，一只猫头鹰“咕咕”地叫，敌人以为是我军袭击队的联络哨音，吓得枪炮齐鸣，把猫头鹰赶走了。过了一会，猫头鹰又飞来了，生活在恐惧中的敌人竟又开起火来。
