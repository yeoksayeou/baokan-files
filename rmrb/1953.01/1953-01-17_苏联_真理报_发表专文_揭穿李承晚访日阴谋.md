Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: "Pravda" published an article by Herklov on the 10th entitled "The Conspiracy in Tokyo," commenting on Syngman Rhee's recent trip to Tokyo.

Herklov pointed out: The topic and general trend of Syngman Rhee's talks in Tokyo are quite obvious. There are still many unresolved issues between Japan and South Korea, such as the issue of fishing rights in Korean territorial waters, Japan's demand for the return of property previously owned by Japanese militarists in Korea, etc. However, these issues have been temporarily set aside, and priority is being given to purely military issues.

Herklov continued: The whole world knows that the American forces in Korea have suffered heavy losses in terms of personnel and equipment. The Korean War launched by American imperialists is the most unpopular among American soldiers and other so-called "United Nations forces" soldiers. Anti-war sentiment is growing in the American army. In view of this situation, the American command is drawing up plans to withdraw most of the American divisions from the front line and replace them with other armies mainly composed of "Asians."

The newspapers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out that Clark, Yoshida, and Syngman Rhee discussed how to gather new cannon fodder to continue the Korean War.

Japanese newspapers speculated that Syngman Rhee and Yoshida "talked about establishing a Far Eastern anti-communist front."

Before leaving Japan, Syngman Rhee said that he had discussed in Tokyo issues "of great interest to our common friend - the United States." It is quite obvious what this "common friend" is interested in. The American military command not only hopes that the Koreans and the group of Kuomintang elements who fled from China and are still huddled in a corner of Taiwan will be at their disposal, but also hopes that the Japanese will be at their disposal.

Major General Chase, head of the U.S. military advisory group in Taiwan, recently expressed the hope that the Kuomintang army would be able to take action in 1953.

It is no secret to anyone what this kind of "action" is all about. After Syngman Rhee left Japan, Kuomintang "government" Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao and Japanese Ambassador to Taipei Kenkichi Yoshizawa arrived in Tokyo at the same time. Yoshizawa said upon arrival at the airport that he did not return "empty-handed," but brought back "gifts of various political, economic and other materials."

Herklov said: The visit of the deadly enemies of the Korean and Chinese people to Japan is for a specific purpose. The United States wants to first widely use Koreans and Japanese as tools to realize their plan to expand aggression against Asia and continue the Korean War. The trip of Syngman Rhee and Yeh Kung-chao to Tokyo is another step in realizing this plan.

This is the purpose of Syngman Rhee and Yeh Kung-chao's trip to Tokyo.

### 苏联“真理报”发表专文  揭穿李承晚访日阴谋

    苏联“真理报”发表专文
    揭穿李承晚访日阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十日发表了贺赫洛夫的题为“东京的密谋”的论文，评述最近李承晚的东京之行。
    贺赫洛夫指出：李承晚在东京会谈的题目和总的趋向是十分明显的。日本和南朝鲜之间还有许多问题没有得到解决，例如朝鲜领海捕鱼权问题、日本要求收回以前的日本军国主义者在朝鲜的财产问题等等。但是这些问题已被暂时搁在一边，尽先谈到的是纯军事问题。
    贺赫洛夫接着说：全世界都知道，在朝鲜的美国军队在兵员和装备方面已遭受了惨重损失。美帝国主义者发动的朝鲜战争，在美国士兵以及其他所谓“联合国军队”的士兵中是最不受欢迎的。在美国军队中，反战情绪日益高涨。鉴于这种情况，美国司令部正在拟定计划，使大部分美国师团撤离前线，而代之以其他主要由“亚洲人”组成的军队。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的报纸指出，克拉克、吉田以及李承晚讨论了如何搜罗新的炮灰以继续进行朝鲜战争的问题。
    日本的报纸推测，李承晚和吉田“谈到了建立远东反共阵线的问题”。
    李承晚在离开日本之前曾说：他在东京讨论了“我们共同的朋友——美国所极感兴趣”的问题。这位“共同的朋友”感兴趣的究竟是什么问题，那是十分明显的。美军司令部不但希望朝鲜人和那群从中国逃走后至今仍缩在台湾一隅的国民党分子受他们支配，而且希望日本人也受他们支配。
    美国驻台湾军事顾问团团长蔡斯少将最近曾表示希望国民党军队在一九五三年能够开始采取行动。
    这种“行动”究竟是怎样一回事，这对任何人说来都已不是秘密了。在李承晚离开日本以后，国民党“政府”外交部长叶公超和日本驻台北大使芳泽谦吉同时抵达东京。芳泽谦吉在抵达机场时发表谈话说：他并没有“空手”回来，而是带着“各种政治、经济和其他材料等礼物”回来的。
    贺赫洛夫说：朝鲜和中国人民的死敌“访问”日本是有一定目的的。美国想首先广泛利用朝鲜人和日本人作工具，以实现他们扩大对亚洲的侵略和继续朝鲜战争的计划，李承晚和叶公超的东京之行正是实现这种计划的又一个步骤。
    这就是李承晚和叶公超到东京去的目的。
