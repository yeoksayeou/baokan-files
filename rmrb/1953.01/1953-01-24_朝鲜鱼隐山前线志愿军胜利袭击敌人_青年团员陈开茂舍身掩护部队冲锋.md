Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 23rd: Our front-line reporter reported on the victorious first battle this year by our army on the Fish Hidden Mountain front southeast of Kimhwa. He said that there are two unnamed hills occupied by the enemy in front of Fish Hidden Mountain. The area is high and the slopes are steep, making it difficult to climb. However, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers guarding Fish Hidden Mountain said: This is a good place to fight the first battle of the year well. The mountain is high, but our skills are even higher.

On a cold night, January 5th, with the north wind blowing snowflakes, two of our night attack teams, led by company commander Cao Wenyi, went to attack the enemy. They stepped on more than a foot of snow and climbed steep slopes of more than 70 degrees, approaching the enemy's front-line positions. At the scheduled time, our army's artillery fiercely bombarded the two enemy positions, destroying the enemy's barbed wire, barricades, and front-line fortifications one by one. Then, squad leader Liao Guohai, who had been credited seven times, charged forward through the smoke and fire of the artillery explosions. He shouted, "Comrades, charge! Maintain the honor of our company's three victories in three battles during the Fifth Campaign!" He fell, seriously wounded, but continued to spray the enemy with his submachine gun. Platoon leader Ma Hengwu told him to go down, but he said, "Don't worry about me, lead everyone forward!" The enemy fired flares. By this light, the warriors could see the enemy's positions clearly. The machine gunners closely blocked the enemy's bunker gun holes, preventing the enemy's machine guns from firing, and covering their comrades' brave charge towards the enemy. A machine gun on the east side of the enemy's position was still roaring. Company commander Cao issued an order to the rocket launcher team: "Blow it up immediately!" He Yinzhang immediately put the rocket launcher on his back, and let shooter Li Yinzhang aim and fire fiercely at the enemy. With a "bang," the enemy's machine gun was silenced. In just thirty minutes, our army's warriors destroyed seventeen enemy bunkers and firing points on these two steep hills, and wiped out three reinforced platoons of the enemy.

On the same night, another unit of our army, dressed in white camouflage, also charged up an unnamed hill southwest of Height 883.7 in the cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The soldiers moved back and forth through the enemy's positions. Our artillerymen set up recoilless guns on trees to bombard the enemy, throwing them into chaos. As a result of this battle, our army wiped out an enemy platoon and a heavy machine gun squad. Our soldier Yang Linqing also persuaded seven Rhee (South Korean) soldiers to surrender their weapons by shouting to them. This shows that the number of Rhee soldiers who are unwilling to carry out the American imperialists' war of aggression on their own land is increasing day by day.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 23rd: In a battle on the Fish Hidden Mountain front southeast of Kimhwa, Korea, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army produced another hero like Huang Jiguang, Chen Kaimao.

On the night of January 5th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army attacked an enemy position near Bianyandong on the Fish Hidden Mountain front. On the road to the attack, the charging troops were blocked by a sudden burst of enemy machine gun fire. At this time, Chen Kaimao, a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, stepped forward bravely. Braving the enemy's dense bullets, he rolled through the snow. He rolled to the side of the enemy's fortifications, and raised his submachine gun to shoot at the enemy; but the submachine gun rolled in the snow and froze the bolt, firing only a few bullets before it could no longer fire. At this time, Chen Kaimao had already been wounded. He threw a grenade at the enemy's firing hole, but because the firing hole was too small, it did not go in. The enemy's machine gun was still firing madly, and Chen Kaimao did not have any other weapons. Unwilling to see his comrades continue to be injured and killed, he resolutely got up from the snow and threw himself onto the enemy's firing hole, using his body to block the gun hole from which machine gun bullets were constantly spraying. Then, his comrades charged up the enemy's position and wiped out more than eighty enemies.

After this battle, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, in accordance with Chen Kaimao's pre-battle application, has specially posthumously recognized Chen Kaimao as a member of the Chinese Communist Party.

    朝鲜鱼隐山前线志愿军胜利袭击敌人
    青年团员陈开茂舍身掩护部队冲锋
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】本社前线记者报道金城东南鱼隐山前线我军今年首战胜利的情形说：鱼隐山前有两座敌人盘踞着的无名高地，这地方山高坡陡，攀登很困难。但是守卫在鱼隐山上的中国人民志愿军战士们却说：这是打好今年第一仗的好地方。山高，我们的本领更高。
    在一月五日北风卷着雪片的寒冷的夜里，我军两支夜袭队由连长曹文义带领着去袭击敌人。他们踏着一尺多厚的积雪，攀登七十多度的陡险的山坡，摸到敌军前沿阵地跟前。到了预定时刻，我军的各种炮火就猛轰这两个敌军阵地，把敌人的铁丝网、鹿砦和前沿工事一一炸毁。接着，立过七次功的班长廖国海穿过炮弹爆炸的烟火向前猛冲。他喊道：“同志们冲吧！保持我们连队在五次战役中三战三捷的荣誉！”他负了重伤跌倒了，仍端着冲锋枪向敌人扫射。排长马恒武叫他下去，他却说：“不要管我，你带领大家前进吧！”敌人射出了照明弹。勇士们借着这个亮光把敌人的阵地看得清清楚楚。机枪射手们便紧紧地封锁着敌人地堡的枪眼，不让敌人的机枪开火，掩护着战友们向敌人勇猛冲锋。东侧敌人阵地上有一挺机枪还在嘶叫着，曹连长向火箭筒组发出命令：“立刻炸掉它！”何银章马上把火箭筒架在自己背上，让射手李银章狠狠地对准敌人射击。只听得“咣”的一声，敌人的机枪就被打得不叫了。仅仅三十分钟，我军勇士们就在这两个险峻的山头上摧毁了敌军的十七个地堡和火力点，消灭了敌军的三个加强排。
    在同一天夜里，另一支披着白色伪装衣的我军部队也在零下三十度的寒冷中冲上了八八三点七高地西南的无名高地。战士们在敌军阵地上来往穿插，我军炮手们把无座力炮架在树上轰击敌人，打得敌人一片混乱。这次战斗结果，我军消灭了敌人一个排和一个重机枪班。我军战士杨林清还用喊话争取了七个李伪军士兵向他缴枪投降。这说明在李伪军中不愿为美帝国主义在自己国土进行侵略战争的人正在日益增多。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】在朝鲜金城东南鱼隐山前线的一次战斗中，英勇的中国人民志愿军又出现了一位黄继光式的英雄陈开茂。
    一月五日夜里，中国人民志愿军袭击鱼隐山前线边岩洞附近的一个敌军阵地。在进攻的道路上，冲锋部队被突然出现的敌人一挺机枪火力拦阻了。这时，中国新民主主义青年团团员陈开茂便挺身而出，冒着敌人密集的子弹，在雪地上滚进。他滚到敌人工事旁边，就端起冲锋枪向敌人射击；但是冲锋枪滚上了雪，冻住了枪机，只射出几发子弹，就不能继续射击了。这时，陈开茂已经负伤，他就向敌人工事的射击孔投去一个手榴弹，但因射击孔太小，没有投进去。敌人的机枪仍在疯狂地射击着，而陈开茂没有带别的武器，他不忍看到自己的战友继续遭到伤亡，便毅然决然地从雪地上爬起来，扑到敌人的射击孔上，用自己的身体堵住了敌人不断喷射机枪子弹的枪眼。接着，他的战友们便冲上了敌人阵地，消灭了八十多个敌人。
    中国共产党志愿军某部委员会在这次战斗以后，根据陈开茂战前的申请，已特地追认陈开茂为中国共产党党员。
