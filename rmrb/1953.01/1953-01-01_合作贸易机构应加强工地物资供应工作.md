    Cooperative Trade Organizations Should Strengthen On-Site Material Supply Work

    Recently, we have received many letters from construction workers and trade union workers, all of whom unanimously request that cooperatives and trade departments solve the problem of supplying daily necessities to workers at construction sites.

    Most of the existing construction sites in various places are located in the suburbs, and some are twenty or thirty miles away from the city. Many construction sites do not have their own cooperative organizations, and there are no shops nearby. Therefore, two practical difficulties have arisen: one is the inability to buy daily necessities, which is the main difficulty. Take the Dingxing construction area of ​​the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company as an example: This construction site is ten miles away from Dingxing County, Hebei Province, and has had more than 3,000 workers working there since mid-May 1952. Because the construction site does not have a material supply organization, workers have to go to the city to buy toothbrushes and towels; a round trip to the city is twenty miles, which takes most of the day. This not only increases the workers' difficulties in life, but also wastes a lot of valuable time. Another practical difficulty is that although there are small villages or scattered small merchants near some construction sites, they can only supply very few items, and the quality cannot meet the workers' requirements. Prices are also extremely expensive. Taking cigarettes as an example, a pack of cigarettes is about 30% more expensive than in the city, which is a very common phenomenon. The food expenses of workers at the Yangfang construction site in Changping County, Hebei, are the same as those of workers in Beijing, but workers in Beijing can eat three meals of refined grains a day, with vegetables at every meal, and can also eat stewed meat once or twice a week; however, they rarely eat meat for two or three months, and even rarely eat vegetables, because the oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, vegetables, and meat are much more expensive than in Beijing. In May 1952, ninety sick people were reported at this construction site within three days. It is understood that this is closely related to poor food. Workers at the Dingxing construction site have more than ten cases of workers asking for leave to go to Beijing every month to buy some simple tools of better quality. Obviously, this has an impact on the progress of the project.

    This problem not only occurs in small towns, but also workers in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guiyang, Chengdu, and Fushun in Northeast China have also written to complain about the difficulty of buying daily necessities. According to readers, on the second day after the Chengdu Nationalities Institute construction site issued October wages, one-third of the workers on the entire construction site asked for leave or were absent from work to go to the city to buy things. Workers at a construction site in the western suburbs of Beijing wrote to say that they had to take advantage of their days off to go to the city to buy necessary daily necessities. At this time, the buses going back and forth between the Summer Palace and Shijingshan Road are too busy. Especially in the evening, workers carrying things are crowded at the bus station waiting for buses to the suburbs. Although the bus company has repeatedly allocated additional vehicles, some people still have to wait for more than two hours to get on the bus. Although the supply work in Fushun City is done relatively well, workers at five construction sites still have to travel six or seven miles to buy items. Obviously, if the supply work at the construction site is done well, the situation would not be like this.

    The above situation shows that the lack of daily necessities at the construction site has not only affected the workers' lives and health, but in some places has also indirectly affected the progress of the project. Therefore, construction workers and trade union workers unanimously request in their letters that cooperative societies and trade systems in various places attach importance to and solve this problem. They demand that distribution organizations be established in larger construction sites or more concentrated construction areas; regular mobile supply should be implemented for smaller or more mobile construction sites; and education should be strengthened for private merchants. On the one hand, they should be mobilized to actively participate in the supply work at the construction site, and on the other hand, it must be guaranteed that transactions are carried out at fair and reasonable prices.

    We believe that the workers' demands are reasonable and hope that cooperative societies and public-private joint trade organizations in various places will find ways to solve this problem as soon as possible.

### 合作贸易机构应加强工地物资供应工作

    合作贸易机构应加强工地物资供应工作
    最近我们收到许多建筑工人和工会工作者来信，他们一致要求合作社和贸易部门解决建筑工地工人的日用必需品的供应问题。
    各地现有的建筑工地，大都是在城郊，有的远离城市二三十里。许多工地因为自己没有合作社组织，而附近又没有商店，因此就发生了两个实际困难：一个是，买不到日用必需品，这是主要的困难。以华北基本建设工程公司定兴工区为例：这个工地离河北定兴县城十里，从一九五二年五月中旬开工，一直有三千多名工人工作。因为工地没有物资供应组织，工人们买牙刷、毛巾都得进城；进一趟城来回就是二十里，得用大半天的时间。这不仅增加了工人生活上的困难，同时也浪费了许多宝贵的时间。另一个实际困难是，有的工地附近虽有小村镇或零散的小商，但所能够供应的东西很少，在质量上也不能满足工人的要求。价格也贵得厉害。就拿纸烟来说，一盒烟要比市里贵百分之三十左右，这是很普遍的现象。河北昌平县羊坊工地工人的伙食费同北京城里的工人们一样多，但北京的工人一天可以吃三顿细粮、顿顿有青菜，每周还可以吃一两次炖肉；但他们却两三个月吃不到肉，甚至很少吃到青菜，这是因为当地的油、盐、酱、醋及青菜、肉类都比北京贵得多。一九五二年五月间，这个工地在三天内就发生了九十个病号。据了解，这与伙食不好有密切关系。定兴工地的工人为了买一些质量较好的简单工具，每月都有十多起工人为此请假上北京。显然，这对工程进度是有影响的。
    这个问题，不仅发生在小城镇，北京、武汉、重庆、贵阳、成都，以及东北抚顺等大中城市的郊区工人，也都来信诉说他们买不到日用品的困难。据读者反映，成都市民族学院工地在发十月份工资的第二天，全工地三分之一的工人请假或旷工进城去买东西。北京市西郊某工地工人来信说，他们为了买必需的日用品，不得不利用工休的日子进城。这时，往来在颐和园和石景山路上的公共汽车，就忙不过来了。特别是傍晚，拿着东西在开往郊区去的汽车站上等车的工人，拥挤不堪。汽车公司虽然一再增拨车辆，有些人还要等两个多小时才能坐上车。抚顺市的供应工作虽然作得比较好，但也有五个工地的工人在买物品时，要往返六七里地。显然，工地的供应工作要是作得好，情况就不会这样了。
    上述情况说明：工地缺乏日常生活必需品的问题，不但已经影响了工人的生活和健康，有的地方还间接地影响了工程的进度。因此，建筑工人和工会工作者在来信中一致要求各地合作社和贸易系统重视并解决这个问题。他们要求：在较大的工地或是比较集中的工区建立分销机构；对较小或流动性较大的工地实行经常性的流动供应；对私商则应加强教育，一方面发动他们积极参加工地供应工作，另方面则必须保证以公平合理的价格进行交易。
    我们认为工人同志们的这些要求是合情合理的，希望各地合作社和公私营贸易机构尽快设法解决这个问题。
