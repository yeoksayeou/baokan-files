    Bad Wood Sold as Good Wood
    User Units Forced to Stop Work and Wait for Materials

    Editor: I am a purchasing agent for the Tianjin District Port Authority of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government. In 1952, I purchased more than 800 cubic meters of wood from the Tianjin Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company. This wood was shipped from the Northeast, and most of it was severely rotten. Because the company sold us this rotten wood as good wood, it directly caused a loss of over 180 million yuan in national wealth. The resulting waste of transportation capacity, reduction in the value of the wood, and damage to the lifespan of basic construction projects cannot yet be calculated.

    Due to the special nature of our bureau's business, the wood we need should be un-rotted, un-decayed, and free of ant nests. However, the Tianjin Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company sold us some rotten hardwood logs after removing the bark as first-class timber. When we picked up the goods, we found that most of the wood was unusable and wanted to select it, but they would not allow us to. As a result, dozens of pieces were broken when unloading. Originally, we planned to use third-class timber for scaffolding boards, but most of the "third-class timber" from the Tianjin Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company did not meet the standards. In our Madaochang dormitory construction site, more than ten of the forty third-class timber scaffolding boards were unusable; at the pier tool room construction site, many of the hundred-plus third-class timber scaffolding boards were also unusable. When erecting the scaffolding, the scaffolding boards broke before the workers even placed anything on them. As a result, the project was suspended due to a lack of scaffolding boards, and we had to temporarily increase the budget for purchasing wood. In addition, disregarding the interests of the user units, their stacking lacked planning, forcing the purchasing units to spend extra on picking, restacking, separating, and loading. I believe that the Tianjin Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company's operating style of blindly pushing out stagnant and rotten wood, regardless of the target or purpose, is very harmful to the country's basic construction. Today, as large-scale economic construction begins, I hope they can thoroughly change this bad style.

### 坏木材充作好木材出售  使用料单位被迫停工待料

    坏木材充作好木材出售
    使用料单位被迫停工待料
    编辑同志：我是中央人民政府交通部天津区港务局的采购员。一九五二年由我经手向中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司购买的木料达八百多立方公尺。这些木材系由东北进关的，其中大部分已腐朽不堪。由于该公司将这些腐朽的木材充作好木材卖给我们，直接造成国家财富的损失约一亿八千多万元，因此而引起的运输力的浪费、木材使用价值的降低和危害基本建设工程寿命等损失，则还无法统计。
    我局因为业务性质特殊，所需的木材应该是不腐，不朽、不带蚂蚁哨的。但是中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司把一些腐朽的硬杂元木去掉皮后便按一等材售与我局。我们在提货时已发现这批木材大部分不能使用，要挑选一下，但他们不让挑选，结果卸车时就摔断了几十根。本来，我们计划用三等材作脚手板，可是中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司的“三等材”大部分不合标准，我们的马道场宿舍工地有四十块三等材的脚手板，其中有十余块不能使用；码头工具房工地有一百多块三等材的脚手板，也有很多不能使用。在搭脚手架时，工人上去了还未放东西脚手板就断了。以致工程因缺乏脚手板而停工，不得不临时追加购买木材的预算。此外，他们不顾用料单位的利益，码垛缺乏计划，使购料单位不得不额外多花挑垛、倒垛、隔垛、装车等费用。我认为中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司这种将呆滞和腐朽的木材，不分对象和用途，盲目推销出去就完事的经营作风，对于国家的基本建设是十分有害的，在大规模经济建设开始的今天，希望他们能彻底改变这种不良作风。　相茂才
