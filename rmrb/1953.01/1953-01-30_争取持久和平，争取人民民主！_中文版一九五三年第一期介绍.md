The first issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

This issue, celebrating the New Year of 1953, features an editorial entitled "Towards New Victories for Socialism, Democracy and Peace!". The editorial summarizes the brilliant achievements of the democratic and socialist world led by the powerful Soviet Union in 1952, and the extreme social chaos and severe setbacks suffered by the imperialist and war world led by the United States. After briefly describing the achievements of the Soviet Union, People's China, the European People's Democratic countries, and Democratic Germany in politics, economy, culture, and mutual cooperation in 1952, and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the editorial points out that in the new year, the countries of the peace and democracy camp will achieve new accomplishments and victories in the struggle for peace, against war, and for a bright future for the people of all countries. The editorial then points out that for the world of capitalism and war, in the past year, the general crisis of the capitalist system has deepened, the contradictions between capitalist countries, especially between Britain and the United States, have intensified, the conditions for economic crisis have become increasingly ripe, and the living standards of the working people have been greatly reduced. The imperialist countries led by the United States have tried to escape the impending economic crisis by intensifying economic militarization and arms race, and deliberately prolonging the Korean War. However, economic militarization has not eliminated and cannot eliminate those factors that lead to economic crisis. On the contrary, in the past year, the strike struggles in the capitalist world reached the highest peak since the war, and the national liberation movements of the people in colonies and dependent countries have greatly developed, and its upsurge has further shaken and destroyed the entire colonial system of imperialism. In the past year, millions more people, regardless of their views and social strata, have joined the torrent of struggle for world peace. As the people of all countries enter the new year, they realize that their strength has greatly increased, and this strength will be able to prevent the threat of a new world war. The editorial finally emphasizes that the struggles of the people of all countries for their own interests, for national independence, and for peace are led everywhere by communist and democratic parties. In the past year, the international communist movement has further grown, and the ranks of communist and workers' parties have expanded and further consolidated organizationally and ideologically. This repeatedly demonstrates the irresistible growth of communist power and the inevitability of the final victory of communism. Under the guidance of Stalin's brilliant work “Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR” and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, communist and workers' parties in all countries will, in the new year, lead their own people in the struggle against imperialist reactionary forces, against the aggressive actions of American imperialism, for the vital interests of the working people and the national independence of their own countries, and for safeguarding and consolidating world peace, and move towards new victories.

This issue also includes the communication "Stalin Avenue in Berlin" and many news items, as well as a letter from the United States "A Year in Review...", book and newspaper introductions "The Ideas of Peace and Democracy Cannot Be Imprisoned", political notes "Secret Police on the Water" and "American 'Killing Room'", which vividly depict the completely different political, economic, and social life of the two worlds of democracy and socialism, capitalism and war, with concrete and vivid examples.

Important articles published in this issue include "The Local People's Councils of Bulgaria" by G. Gimov, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and "The Conspiratorial Activities of American and British Spies Exposed" by K. Bacilek, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

Gimov's article introduces in detail the election situation of the local people's councils of the working people of Bulgaria, the class essence and nature of the local people's councils, their tasks, working methods, and their achievements and shortcomings.

Bacilek's article focuses on the despicable and shameless activities of the Tito spy and murderer group exposed in the trial of the anti-state conspiracy center in Czechoslovakia headed by Slansky.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第一期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第一期已经出版。
    本期为庆祝一九五三年新年发表了题为“走向社会主义、民主与和平的新胜利！”的社论。社论总结了一九五二年以强大的苏联为首的民主与社会主义世界的光辉成就和以美国为首的帝国主义与战争世界的社会极度混乱和遭受严重挫折的情况。社论在扼要叙述了苏联、人民中国、欧洲人民民主国家和民主德国一九五二年在政治、经济、文化和彼此合作等方面的成就以及人民生活水平的不断提高后指出：在新的一年中，和平民主阵营各国在争取和平、反对战争以及为各国人民争取光明前途的斗争中，将获得新的成就与胜利。社论接着指出：对于资本主义和战争的世界，过去一年中，资本主义体系总危机加深了，资本主义国家之间的矛盾、尤其是英美之间的矛盾更加剧烈了，经济危机的条件日益成熟，劳动人民的生活水平大大降低了。以美国为首的帝国主义各国，曾力图以加紧经济军事化和军备竞争、故意延长朝鲜战争来逃脱即将到来的经济危机。可是经济军事化没有消灭而且也不可能消灭那些导向经济危机的因素。相反的，过去一年中，在资本主义世界中，罢工斗争达到了战后最高潮，殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动大大发展了，它的高涨更加动摇和破坏了帝国主义的全部殖民体系。过去一年中，又有数以百万计的人不分见解和社会阶层参加到争取世界和平的斗争洪流中来。世界各国人民在进入新的一年时都意识到自己的力量已大大增长，这一力量将能阻止新世界大战的威胁。社论最后着重指出：各国人民争取切身利益、争取民族独立和争取和平的斗争，到处都是由共产主义的和民主的政党领导的。过去一年中，国际共产主义运动已进一步增长，共产党和工人党的队伍扩大了、在组织和思想上进一步巩固了。这上面就一再表现出共产主义力量无法阻挡地增长的规律性、共产主义获得最后胜利的必然性。在斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件的引导下，各国共产党和工人党将在新的一年里，领导他们自己的人民在反对帝国主义反动势力、反对美帝国主义的侵略行动、争取劳动人民的切身利益和本国的民族独立、争取维护与巩固世界和平的斗争中，走向新的胜利。
    本期还刊载了通讯“柏林的斯大林大街”和不少消息，以及美国来信“一年回顾……”、书报介绍“和平与民主的思想是监禁不了的”、政治箚记“水上秘密警察”和“美国‘杀人室’”，分别以具体生动的事例描绘出民主与社会主义、资本主义与战争两个世界完全不同的政治、经济、社会生活。
    本期刊载的重要文章有保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局候补委员吉·吉摩夫的“保加利亚的地方人民议会”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员卡·巴契列克的“被揭穿了的美英间谍的阴谋活动”。
    吉摩夫的文章详细地介绍了保加利亚劳动人民地方人民议会的选举情况、地方人民议会的阶级本质和性质、任务、工作方法以及它们的成就和缺点。
    巴契列克的文章着重论述了以斯兰斯基为首的捷克斯洛伐克反国家阴谋中心审讯中所暴露的铁托间谍和杀人犯集团的卑鄙无耻活动。
