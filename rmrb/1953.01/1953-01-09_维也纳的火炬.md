　　The father carried a little daughter with blue silk ribbons in her hair on his shoulders, the mother held high a blue cloth banner with white characters that said "Peace for Children," and residents from all occupied zones of Vienna shouted slogans, smiling, crowding, walking through the ring road in the city center, waving and cheering to the peace delegates from various countries standing on the temporary reviewing stand next to the Parliament Building. Young people sang songs, children held light balloons. Railway workers and tram workers, solemnly dressed in uniforms, passed by in formation, led by a band composed of the workers themselves, their faces solemn.

　　At four o'clock in the afternoon, it was already completely dark, and it was raining lightly, but in the light of the torches held by the procession and the dazzling beams of the arc lamps, were thousands upon thousands of excited faces and hopeful eyes. The procession squeezed towards the reviewing stand, constantly breaking through the not-so-strict cordon line formed by the crowd's own organized pickets, who were using their arms to create a line of defense, throwing bouquets to the delegates. A mother begged the pickets to let her and her daughter pass through, and then she pointed out each peace delegate one by one, asking her little daughter to kiss their faces one by one. A father held his son's hand, took out a mechanical pencil from his pocket, and insisted on giving it to a delegate, in the name of him and his son, to thank the guests who had come to Vienna for peace. Women untied the blue headscarves with peace doves printed on them from their heads and gave them to the female delegates. One woman took out photos of her three children from her bosom and insisted that the person from tens of thousands of miles away, whom she had never met and with whom she could not communicate, accept them as a souvenir. Old ladies did not speak, but wiped their eyes, which shone with kindness and gentleness, with their handkerchiefs.

　　The torch procession moved forward continuously, and more and more blue cloth banners passed by, one after another: "Peace is employment," "Safe life, safe work," "We don't want the Cold War anymore!" "Vienna welcomes peace delegates," and there were millions of paper signs with "Peace" written in various languages waving.

　　The expressions on people's faces were different from those of people who had already obtained freedom and democracy. In their joy, there was anxiety; in their hope, there was indignation.

　　Workers from a chemical company expressed their determination on a blue cloth banner: "We don't want to manufacture gunpowder, we want to manufacture medicines for peaceful life." Workers from an optical instrument company held up a banner with striking statistics: "Eighty-three workers in our factory died in World War II, eighteen were killed by the Nazis, twenty-eight sacrificed themselves in concentration camps, fifteen were bombed to death, fifty-one were disabled, and twenty-three are missing. We don't want war!"

　　They raised their clenched fists.

　　The wishes and will of the two million residents of Vienna and the six million people of all of Austria, whose war wounds had not yet healed but who were suffering from the threat of a new war, were fully expressed in the peace demonstration held on December 13th, the second day of the opening of the World People's Peace Congress. They broke through the obstruction of the reactionary regime and shouted out their loud voices.

　　The Austrian reactionaries attempted to block the people's ears, eyes, and mouths. The bourgeois newspapers, serving the American imperialist warmongers, initially did not mention the Vienna Congress at all. Later, they could no longer pretend to be deaf and dumb, so they had to change their tactics and start clamoring some stale rumors, such as "Communist meeting," and so on. One newspaper, the "Vienna Morning News," even pretended to be calm. Facing the fact that the people of Vienna welcomed this great peace congress with such enthusiasm, it actually nonsensically said: "Vienna is not at all interested in the World People's Peace Congress." Any delegate who participated in the demonstration, regardless of his political views, could not help but laugh at such a lie.

　　How could the Austrian people, who had suffered from the last war and the imperialist Cold War policy after the war, "not be interested" in the peace, security, and independence of their country?

　　In post-war Austria, due to the American imperialists' deliberate delay in signing the Austrian peace treaty, the troops of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France have not yet withdrawn. The reactionary ruling parties—the People's Party and the Socialist Party—faithfully implement Wall Street's war policy, oppress the people's democratic freedom, and suck the resources and blood of the Austrian people, causing serious damage to Austria's economic structure, trade deficits, overproduction, a sharp decline in people's living standards, and politically becoming a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, acting as a puppet of American imperialism. Western Austria, under the occupation of the United States, Britain, and France, is being more rapidly militarized and fascistized. As Austrian delegate Professor Taublatzberger said at the conference, his country has actually become one of the military bases of the United States, and the many military facilities already built "will endanger the lives of the Austrian people."

　　An Austrian from Linz who came to participate in the work of the Peace Congress talked to me about the situation in the American-occupied zone. He said that the U.S. military conducts two large-scale military exercises every year in spring and autumn, "They mark every bridge and attach explosives, indicating that they want to destroy it. But these American soldiers are very afraid of the Soviet army. For some reason, their exercises are first an offensive, then a retreat, all the way back into the deep mountains... Maybe the last thing they practice is guerrilla warfare?" My Austrian friend's eyes sparkled with mischief. But the light dimmed immediately, and he continued: "They are building bunkers and firing ranges everywhere on our land. They have confiscated hundreds and hundreds of hectares of land to build artillery practice grounds, tank testing grounds, underground fuel depots, airports, and airplane hangars, and built ammunition depots in the deep mountains to store bombs, and built and widened highways and bridges that they consider strategic, even in Salzburg, such an ancient cultural city, it is not spared. You know, it is Mozart's birthplace! The architecture there is famous throughout Europe, but the Americans are building warehouses for explosives and poisons there, with warnings written on the warehouse walls saying 'Contains corrosive gas'." This Austrian excitedly continued: "As long as he is an Austrian, no matter what class he belongs to, he opposes the US military building military facilities in Mozart's hometown and other cities in Austria. Only those Hitler elements, royalist elements, and adventurers who have wholeheartedly sided with American monopoly capitalists would not frown at the possibility that these military facilities might one day blow these cultural cities into rubble and bury their motherland in flames."

　　Vienna is an even more historically famous European cultural city, the "City of Music," filled with statues of musicians, Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, Schubert, Johann Strauss... There are also statues of painters from the Renaissance, Rubens, Titian, Raphael... Although the streets are full of companies dumping American and West German goods, music scores and biographies of Beethoven are still displayed in bookstore windows; although American cold cream, Coca-Cola, and Hollywood movie billboards stand everywhere, those Gothic spires, Greek Doric architecture, marble statues of artists, and monuments have not been completely obscured. The beautiful palaces and gardens of the Habsburg royal family, and the Vienna Woods in the famous songs, still attract people's interest in travel. Any nation cherishes its cultural heritage, and they are determined not to let the spiritual and material wealth left by their ancestors for thousands of years turn into ashes under napalm bombs. But American monopoly capitalists want to use "B-29s" to deal with the culture of other countries that cannot be corrupted by their decadent barbarian culture.

　　The people of the world have not forgotten that before Hitler attacked Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union, he first occupied Austria, using it as a springboard for attacking the East. Now Hitler's disciples still want to copy their teacher's essay, setting their sights on this "post deeply embedded in the East"—as the New York Herald Tribune said in early 1949. Therefore, "the U.S. military must try to station there as long as possible" in Austria, and they dream of "recovering Southeastern Europe" from here.

　　Austria has become an outpost on the front line of the warmongers' Cold War.

　　The American imperialists are preparing for war, causing the enslaved Austrian people to bear the heavy burden of military spending, suffering from rising prices and unemployment. The number of unemployed people in Austria has reached 200,000.

　　On Vienna's Kärntner Straße, in the commercial center, beautiful shop windows display expensive goods, and Christmas decorations attract pedestrians, but few can afford to buy them. The number of people peering in from outside the windows and the emptiness inside the stores are in stark contrast. Beggars wait outside the revolving glass doors of restaurants.

　　An Austrian female teacher told me that since the current government took office seven years ago, Austrian prices have risen five times, equivalent to ten times the pre-war level, but wages have only increased to five times. The pre-war wage tax was originally 5%, but after Hitler's occupation, a 5% war expense burden was added, making it 10%. The government has repeatedly promised the people to abolish this extra wage tax used to supply the aggressor army's war expenses, but it has always broken its promise. A worker only earns 200 to 400 Austrian schillings a month, but dozens of schillings are deducted each month for various taxes. He said that the life of an employed worker after the war is almost the same as the life of an unemployed worker before the war.

　　Austria exports electricity to West Germany, making the originally cheaper Austrian electricity very expensive, even more expensive than West Germany, which is the result of the Marshall Plan.

　　A car driver talked about the price of gasoline, and he angrily stated that even though the drivers had held demonstrations and protests, the price of gasoline still rose. He said: "The gasoline is produced in the Soviet-occupied oil fields. The Soviet-occupied authorities sell it to the government for 1.1 schillings per gallon, but the government sells it to the market for 4.4 schillings. It's outrageous! I used to vote for the Socialist Party, but this time I'm going to vote for the People's Opposition Front."

　　The People's Opposition Front is a newly established united front organization including progressive parties and non-partisan people, advocating peace and independence. It will participate in the election at the beginning of this year. As the fascist face of the anti-people group is increasingly exposed and the people's awareness is increased, the forces of peace in Austria are growing stronger day by day.

　　On the way back from participating in the peace demonstration on the 13th, the delegates looked at the gradually receding flames of millions of torches jumping in the night sky and excitedly talked about their impressions. Many people believed that if it were not for the urgent demand of the Austrian people for peace, and if it were not for the increased awareness of the people, it would have been impossible to realize such a grand parade under the deception, intimidation, and obstruction of the reactionary government. They believe that Austria is a good example, illustrating how the people in countries controlled by the imperialist Cold War policy are thinking and resisting! They believe that this parade is a good education for those who are still doubtful and deceived by rumors. The demand for peace and security arises naturally in the hearts of all good people, and it is by no means "manufactured" by the Communist Party, and the imperialists cannot use this kind of slander to scare away the people who are beginning to awaken. Let us listen to what Nitti, chairman of the Italian Parliamentary Joint Peace Committee, who did not participate in the peace movement in the past but recently became an active peace advocate, said: "Yesterday I participated in the peace demonstration. I saw vast crowds shouting peace in various languages. People often say that such a demonstration can only be held in those communist countries, or in those countries that have a powerful Communist Party. Vienna is not such an example. Enthusiastic crowds spontaneously gathered to demonstrate, to shout the truth that life will surely defeat death and destruction. This global trend is growing stronger in all countries, becoming an irresistible force."

    维也纳的火炬
    袁水拍
    爸爸在肩头上扛着一个发上打蓝绸结的小女儿，妈妈高举起“和平为了儿童”的蓝布白字旗，维也纳各占领区的居民们高喊口号，微笑着，拥挤着，走过城中心的环行路，向站在国会大厦旁边临时搭起的检阅台上的各国和平代表们招手，欢呼。青年们唱着歌，儿童们手牵着轻气球。铁路工人和电车工人严肃地穿着制服，成队地经过，领先的是工人自己组成的乐队，他们的面容是庄严的。
    下午四时，天已经全黑了，而且下着小雨，但在队伍所持的火炬的光亮里和耀目的弧光灯的光柱里出现的，是成千成万兴奋的脸，满怀希望的眼睛。队伍向检阅台边挤，时时突破了群众自己组织的纠察队用手臂拉起来做成的一条并不严格的警卫线，把花束投给代表们。一个母亲请求纠察队员让她和她女儿通过去，然后她指点着一个一个和平代表，要她的小女儿逐一去亲他们的脸。一个父亲牵住儿子的手，摘下口袋里的自动铅笔，坚决要送给一个代表，以他们父子俩的名义，感谢为和平而来到维也纳的客人。妇女们解下自己头上包的印着和平鸽的蓝色头巾送给女代表们。有一个妇女从怀里掏出自己三个孩子的像片，一定要那个来自千万里外的从不相识而且言语不通的人收下做纪念。老太太们不说话，用手绢抹一下流露着善良的柔和的光的眼睛。
    火炬的队伍不停地前进，越来越多的蓝布标语一幅一幅经过：“和平就是就业”，“安全的生活，安全的工作”，“我们再也不要冷战！”“维也纳欢迎和平代表”，还有千百万面用各种文字写的“和平”的纸牌挥动着。
    人们脸上的表情，是和已经得到自由民主的人民不同的，在他们的喜悦里，有着焦虑；在他们的希望里，有着激愤。
    一家化学公司的工人在蓝布的横幅标语上表示出自己的决心：“我们不要制造火药，我们要制造和平生活的药品。”一家光学器械公司的工人们高举写着触目的统计数字的标语：“我们厂里的工人在二次大战中战死八十三名，被纳粹杀死十八名，在集中营里牺牲二十八名，炸死十五名，残废五十一名，失踪二十三名。我们不要战争！”
    他们举起了紧握拳头的手臂。
    战争创伤未复，却又遭受新战争威胁的维也纳二百万居民和全奥国六百万人民的愿望和意志，在十二月十三日，世界人民和平大会开幕的第二天所举行的和平示威游行中，已经充分表达出来了。他们冲破了反动政权的阻挡，喊出了自己的响亮的声音。
    奥国反动派企图堵塞人民的耳朵、眼睛和嘴巴。为美帝国主义战争贩子服役的资产阶级报纸最初对维也纳大会一字不提，后来再也不能装聋作哑了，只好改变办法，开始叫嚣一些陈腐的谣言，什么“共产党的会议”等等。有一家“维也纳晨报”还故作镇静，面对维也纳人民这样满怀热忱地欢迎这个伟大的和平大会的事实，竟胡说什么：“维也纳对世界人民和平大会一点也不感到兴趣。”凡是参加了示威游行的代表，不管他政治见解怎样，总不能不对这样的撒谎感到好笑。
    身受上次大战和战后帝国主义冷战政策的痛苦的奥地利人民，怎么会对自己国家的和平安全和独立“不感到兴趣”呢？
    战后的奥地利，由于美帝国主义者故意拖延对奥和约的签订，致苏、美、英、法四国驻军迄未撤退。反动的执政党——人民党和社会党忠实地执行华尔街的战争政策，压迫人民的民主自由，吮吸奥国的资源和人民的膏血，使奥国的经济机构受到严重损害，贸易逆差，生产过剩，人民生活水准急遽下降，政治上也成为北大西洋公约集团的一分子，作美帝国主义者的傀儡。西奥在美、英、法的占领下，更迅速地军事化和法西斯化。正如这次在大会上发言的奥地利代表陶布莱茨伯格教授所说，他的国家实际上已成为美国的军事基地之一，已经建筑的许多军事设备，“将使奥地利人民生命遭受危险”。
    从林兹城来参加和平大会工作的一个奥国人和我谈到那边美占区的情形。他说，美军每年在春秋两季举行两次大规模的军事演习，“他们把每一座桥梁都划上记号，按上炸药，表示要炸毁。但是这些美国兵非常害怕苏联军队。不知道什么理由，他们演习的，先是进攻，后是撤退，一直撤退到深山里去……也许最后是演习打游击吧？”我的奥国朋友的眼睛里闪着俏皮的光。但一下子那光芒就黯淡了，他继续说道：“他们在我们国土上到处建筑碉堡，打靶场，他们没收了几百公顷又几百公顷的土地建筑大炮演习场，坦克试验场，地下燃料库，飞机场、飞机库，在深山里建筑贮藏炸弹的军火库，修建和加宽他们认为有战略性的公路和桥梁，即使在萨尔斯堡这样古老的文化名城也不能免。你知道，它是莫扎特的诞生地啊！那儿的建筑是全欧闻名的，可是美国人在那儿建筑爆炸物和毒品的仓库，仓库墙上写着‘内藏糜烂性毒气’的警告。”这个奥国人激动地继续说：“只要是一个奥国人，不管他属于那一阶层，都反对美军在莫扎尔特的故乡和奥国的其他城市，建造军事设备，只有那些死心塌地投靠美国独占资本家的希特勒分子、保皇派分子、冒险家们，才对于这些军事设备可能有一天把这些文化名城炸成瓦砾，把自己祖国埋葬在火焰里，会不皱一下眉头。”
    维也纳更是历史上著名的欧洲的文化名城，“音乐之城”，到处是音乐家的雕像，贝多芬、勃拉姆斯、莫扎特、舒伯特、约翰·斯特劳士……也有文艺复兴时代的画家的雕像，罗朋斯、替善、拉斐尔……虽则街上充斥着倾销美国和西德商品的公司，但书店橱窗里还陈列着乐谱和贝多芬的传记；虽则美国雪花膏、可口可乐和好莱坞电影广告牌到处矗立，但那些高惕式的尖塔，希腊圆柱式建筑，大理石的艺术家的雕像和纪念碑还是没有完全被遮掩。哈普斯堡王室的美丽的宫殿和花园，著名的歌曲中的维也纳森林，依旧吸引着人们的游兴。任何民族都珍爱自己的文化遗产，他们决不愿意千百年来祖先留下的精神和物质财富，在凝固汽油弹下面化为灰烬。但美国独占资本家却要把凡是不能被他们的没落的野蛮主义的文化所腐蚀掉的别的国家的文化，都用“B二十九”去对付。
    世界人民都没有忘记，希特勒在进攻捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和苏联之前，首先占领了奥地利，把它作为进攻东方的跳板。现在希特勒的徒弟们依旧想抄袭他们老师的文章，看中了这个“深深地伸入东方的岗位”——这是纽约先锋论坛报在一九四九年初就说的。因此“美军要设法尽可能长久驻扎”在奥地利，他们梦想从这里“收复东南欧”。
    奥地利变成了战争贩子冷战线上的前哨阵地。
    美帝国主义者进行备战，使被奴役的奥地利人民沉重地担负着军费的重担，忍受着物价上涨和失业的痛苦。奥国失业人数已达二十万。
    在维也纳商业中心的维特纳大街上，漂亮的橱窗里陈列着昂贵的货品，圣诞节的装璜吸引着行人，可是能够买的人很少，在窗外张望的人数和店里的空无一人，成为鲜明的对照。乞丐守候在餐馆的玻璃转门的外面。
    一个奥国女教师对我说，自从现在的政府执政七年以来，奥国物价已经上涨五次，相当于战前的十倍，工资却只加到五倍。战前的工资税原为百分之五，希特勒占领后，增加了百分之五的战费负担，变成百分之十。政府屡次向人民许下诺言，要取消这一笔供给侵略军作战费用的额外的工资税，可是始终食言。一个工人每月只有二百到四百奥国先令的工资，每月倒要扣去各种捐税几十个先令。他说，战后的就业工人的生活和战前失业工人的生活差不多。
    奥国把电力输出到西德，使原来比较便宜的奥国电力变得很贵，甚至反而贵过西德，这是马歇尔计划的结果。
    一个汽车司机谈到了汽油的价格，他生气地表示，虽则经过司机们举行了示威抗议，汽油还是涨价。他说：“汽油是苏占区油田生产的，苏占区当局卖给政府每加仑一点一先令，政府卖给市场却变成了四点四先令。真是岂有此理！我过去是选社会党的，这回我要选人民反对阵线了。”
    人民反对阵线是新成立的包括进步党派和无党派人士的统一战线组织，主张和平和独立，它将参加今年年初的竞选。由于反人民集团的法西斯面目日益暴露，人民觉悟的提高，奥地利的和平的力量一天天在壮大。
    在参加十三日的和平示威游行回去的路上，代表们望着渐渐远去的，在夜空下跳腾着的千百万枝火炬的焰苗，都兴奋地交谈着他们的感想。好些人都认为要不是奥地利人民对和平的要求的迫切，要不是人民觉悟的提高，在反动政府的欺骗恫吓和阻挠下，这样盛大的游行是不可能实现的。他们相信，奥地利是个很好的例子，说明了在帝国主义冷战政策控制下的国家的人民，是怎样在思想，在反抗！他们相信，这次的游行对于那些还心存疑虑，被谣言所蒙蔽的人们，是很好的教育。和平安全的要求是所有善良人民心中自然产生的，决不是共产党
    “制造”出来的，而且帝国主义者也决不能用这种谰言来吓退开始觉悟的人们。让我们听一听过去并不参加和平运动，最近成为一个积极的和平拥护者、意大利议会联合和平委员会主席尼蒂的话吧，他说：“昨天我参加了和平示威，我看见广大的群众用各种语言高呼着和平。人们常说，这样的示威运动只有在那些共产主义国家里，或者在那些具有
    一个强大的共产党的国家里，才可能举行。维也纳却不属于这样一个例子。热情的群众自动地集合起来示威，来高呼生命一定会战胜死亡和破坏的真理。这个全人类的潮流正在所有的国家里壮长起来，成为不可抗拒的力量。”
