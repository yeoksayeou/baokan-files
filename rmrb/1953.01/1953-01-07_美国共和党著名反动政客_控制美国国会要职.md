Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: News: The Republican-majority 83rd United States Congress opened on the 3rd. The appointments of the Republican leaders of both houses, known for their bellicosity and reactionary views, who will play a guiding role in this new US Congress, have been formally approved. Taft, known for his anti-labor stance, will serve as Republican leader in the Senate; Bridges will serve as President Pro Tempore of the Senate; Knowland will serve as Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee; Millikin will serve as Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference; Martin will become Speaker of the House; and Halleck will be the Republican leader of the House of Representatives.

The Republican dignitaries of the new US Congress have long indicated that they are warmongers keen on aggression in the Far East. Many of them have continuously advocated continuing and expanding the war of aggression against Korea. Bridges openly clamored that "We can never end this (Korean) war unless we win throughout the world." On December 17th of last year, in an interview with a reporter from the American "Newsweek," he stated that "high military pressure" must be used in Korea, including the use of atomic weapons and the bombing of Northeast China. Martin, in his talk also published in a "Newsweek" issue, directly opposed continuing the Korean armistice negotiations, and advocated adopting a "more combative policy." He believes that under the current circumstances, "any Korean armistice agreement is meaningless." Knowland is one of the well-known American patrons of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang in Taiwan, and also one of the main advocates of the American Far East expansion policy. In a speech he delivered in November of last year, he suggested taking new military actions to break the "stalemate" in Korea and pressuring American vassal states to send more troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. Bridges, Martin, and Knowland also unanimously advocated blockading the Chinese coast, expanding the Rhee Syngman's troops, and using the Kuomintang remnant bandit troops in Taiwan to expand war operations in the Far East.

In addition, Wiley, the former Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who will now serve as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently openly told reporters from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine that he "100% opposes" ending the Korean War on a fair and reasonable basis and returning Taiwan to the Chinese people.

The new US Congress, manipulated by this group of extremely reactionary and extremely vicious warmongering Republican politicians, will be a loyal helper of the Eisenhower government in implementing policies of expanded aggressive adventures and arms expansion and war preparations.

    美国共和党著名反动政客
    控制美国国会要职
    【新华社六日讯】华盛顿消息：共和党占多数的美国第八十三届国会于三日开幕。在美国这个新国会中将起指导作用的、以好战和反动著称的共和党两院首脑人物的任命已正式通过。以反劳工著称的塔夫脱任参议院共和党领袖；勃里奇任参议院临时议长；诺兰任参议院共和党政策委员会主席；米利金任参议院共和党议员大会主席；马丁出任众议院议长；哈勒克为众议院共和党领袖。
    美国新国会的共和党显要们早已表明他们是热中于远东侵略的大战争贩子，他们中间的许多人曾经不断地鼓吹继续和扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。勃里奇曾公开叫嚣“如果我们不在全世界胜利，我们决不能结束这个（朝鲜）战争”。去年十二月十七日他在接见美国“新闻周刊”记者时表示必须在朝鲜“使用高度的军事压力”，包括使用原子武器和轰炸我国东北。马丁在他的也是发表在一期“新闻周刊”上的谈话中直截了当地反对继续朝鲜停战谈判，而主张采取“更有战斗性的政策”，他认为：在目前情况下，“任何朝鲜停战协议都是没有意义的”。诺兰是台湾蒋介石残余匪帮的出名的美国后台老板之
    一，也是美国远东扩张政策的主要鼓吹者之一。他在去年十一月间发表的一篇演说里曾建议采取新的军事行动来打开朝鲜的“僵局”，并压迫美国的仆从国家出更多的兵参加侵朝战争。勃里奇、马丁和诺兰还异口同声地主张封锁中国海岸，扩大李承晚的部队和使用台湾国民党残匪军队来在远东扩大战争行动。
    此外，原参议院外交委员会共和党委员、现在将出任参议院外交委员会主席的维利，最近曾对“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的记者公然表示他“百分之百地反对”在公平合理基础上结束朝鲜战争和把台湾交还给中国人民。
    在这一批极端反动的、极端凶恶的战争贩子共和党政客操纵下的美国新国会，将是艾森豪威尔政府实行扩大侵略冒险和扩军备战政策的忠实帮手。
