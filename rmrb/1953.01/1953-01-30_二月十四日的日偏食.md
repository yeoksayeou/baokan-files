The Partial Solar Eclipse on February 14th
Zhang Yu Zhe, Director of Nanjing Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Editor's Note: A solar eclipse will occur on February 14th (the first day of the Lunar New Year) this year. This is a natural phenomenon. We are publishing this article to explain the scientific principles of solar eclipses. This morning (January 30th), a total lunar eclipse will be visible in various locations. Like a solar eclipse, it is also a natural phenomenon. Sometimes, the Earth revolves exactly between the Sun and the Moon. If the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in a straight line, the Moon enters the Earth's shadow, and the Earth blocks the light from the Sun reaching the Moon, a lunar eclipse occurs. However, even during a total lunar eclipse, we can still see a faint, dim Moon. This is because the Earth is surrounded by a layer of air, and when sunlight passes through this layer, it is refracted, and some light still reaches the Moon.

On February 14th this year, almost all parts of the country (except for the westernmost border provinces) will be able to see the phenomenon of a partial solar eclipse in the morning. This solar eclipse is only a partial eclipse, not a total eclipse. In other words, the Moon will not completely cover the Sun, turning day into night. If you are working indoors, you will not feel any changes in the sky.

What are the characteristics of this solar eclipse this year? Like solar eclipses in previous years, this solar eclipse is a common natural phenomenon. The difference is that this solar eclipse occurs on February 14th – the first day of the Lunar New Year of Gui Si. Our nation has always attached great importance to this day of the Lunar New Year. Some people believe that if this day goes smoothly, then everything will be successful throughout the year. Therefore, if people see a piece missing from the sun on the first day of the New Year, they will inevitably be alarmed, become suspicious, and consider it an ominous omen. This superstitious thinking still exists among some of the masses and deserves our attention.

Now, I will tell you the time and situation of this solar eclipse.

First, let's talk about Beijing. On Saturday, February 14th, a little after 7:27 in the morning, the Moon will begin to cover the Sun. However, because the sun has just risen and is still very close to the southeastern horizon, it is not easy to observe. As the sun gradually rises, the portion of the Sun's surface invaded by the Moon's shadow gradually increases. One hour later (8:27), the eclipsed part of the Sun reaches its maximum. If we divide the diameter of the Sun into ten parts, then the part of the diameter covered by the Moon at this time reaches more than six parts. From this time on, the Moon begins to slowly move away from the Sun. By 9:31, there are no defects on the sun, and it returns to its normal state.

What about the solar eclipse in other cities in China? Generally speaking, the time of seeing the solar eclipse is earlier in the west than in the east, and earlier in the south than in the north (because the moon moves from east to west, and the shadow of the moon moves from west to east. If calculated at the same time, the time when the western part of our country sees the solar eclipse is earlier than the eastern part, and similarly, the southern part is also earlier than the northern part.), but the difference in time is generally no more than one hour. However, in western cities of China, the phenomenon of the initial eclipse cannot be seen, because the Moon has already begun to cover part of it when the sun has not yet risen above the horizon. If February 14th is a sunny day, everyone can personally observe the Sun at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning to see if our prediction is correct. However, the sunlight is very strong, and it is not appropriate to look at it directly with the naked eye. We can use dark glasses or blackened glass for observation, which can protect our eyes. In addition, we can also put clear water in a basin in an open place and observe the sun reflected in the water.

There is nothing strange about a solar eclipse occurring on the first day of the lunar month. Because the first day is the most normal date for a solar eclipse (all solar eclipses should occur on the first day), it would be strange if it didn't happen on the first day. The first day of each month in the Lunar calendar, usually called the "朔日" (shuori, new moon day), is the day when the Moon catches up with the Sun and reaches the same longitude. We all know that when the Sun and Moon move, the Moon always revolves around the Earth, and the Earth revolves around the Sun. For the sake of simplicity, let's talk about the phenomena on the surface of the sky. The Sun's movement among the constellations takes one year to travel around the celestial sphere. We call this route the ecliptic. The Moon's movement among the stars takes only one month to travel around the celestial sphere. Its route can be called the Moon's orbit. If the Moon's orbit and the ecliptic on the celestial sphere coincide, then every month, the Moon must catch up with the Sun once, cover it, and cause a solar eclipse. But in fact, it is not that there is a solar eclipse every time the sun and moon have the same longitude on the first day of the month. The reason is that the ecliptic and the moon's orbit in the sky do not coincide, but form two large circles that intersect each other. The two planes of the ecliptic and the moon's orbit form an angle of five degrees. If the new moon, when the sun and moon have the same longitude, happens to occur when the Sun reaches the point farthest from the ecliptic and the moon's orbit, then although the Moon and the Sun have the same longitude at this time, they are far apart in the sky. From our point of view, there is still a gap equivalent to the length of nine moons between them. The Moon certainly cannot cover the Sun and cause a solar eclipse. However, if the Sun is near the intersection of the ecliptic and the moon's orbit and encounters a new moon, then the Moon can cover the Sun and cause a solar eclipse.

Now, we already understand that there are two points on the ecliptic that are opposite (180 degrees apart), which are the intersection points with the moon's orbit. If the Sun is near the intersection point and encounters a new moon, a solar eclipse will occur. How large is the area near the intersection point that can cause a solar eclipse? We have calculated that it takes more than 30 days for the Sun to pass through this area. There must be at least one new moon within 30 days, and at most there can be two new moons. Therefore, every time the sun goes near the intersection point, there is at least one solar eclipse, and at most there are two solar eclipses.

If these two intersection points have fixed positions on the ecliptic, then the occurrence of solar eclipses in each year also has a certain period. People can also conveniently predict the dates of solar eclipses in advance. However, these two intersection points move in the opposite direction to the Sun on the ecliptic, and it takes only eighteen years and a few days to travel around the ecliptic. If the Sun starts from the ascending node (the intersection point of the ecliptic and the moon's orbit that the Sun passes through when running from south to north) in early January, then it can reach the descending node (the intersection point of the ecliptic and the moon's orbit that the Sun passes through when running from north to south) in late June, and return to the ascending node again in mid-December. Therefore, there are at least two solar eclipses in a year, and at most there can be five. However, because only a small part of the Earth's surface can see a solar eclipse, although the number of solar eclipses each year is large, a place has to wait many years to have the opportunity to see a solar eclipse. Conversely, a lunar eclipse occurs because the Moon runs into the Earth's shadow. The hemisphere of the Earth that can see the Moon can also see the lunar eclipse at the same time. There can be as few as zero lunar eclipses in each year, and as many as three. In short, the total number of solar and lunar eclipses each year will not exceed seven.

From our point of view, the size of the Sun and the Moon seems to be about the same. In fact, the diameter of the Sun is four hundred times larger than the diameter of the Moon, and the distance between the Sun and the Earth is about four hundred times greater than the distance between the Moon and the Earth, so they look the same size. The distances between the Moon, Earth, and Sun change at any time, so in people's eyes, the Moon sometimes looks slightly larger than the Sun, and sometimes slightly smaller. Therefore, the Moon can sometimes completely cover the Sun and cause a total eclipse; sometimes the Moon can only cover the middle of the Sun, and a line of the Sun's edge is still exposed around it, which becomes an annular eclipse. Only during a total eclipse can we see phenomena such as the daytime turning into night and the appearance of stars. Regardless of annular or partial eclipses, as long as a small part of the sun is exposed outside the moon, the sky will still be very bright.

Astronomers are particularly interested in solar eclipses, especially total solar eclipses, because the Sun is the main research object of astronomers. And certain problems about the Sun can only be observed and studied during the few minutes of a total solar eclipse. For example, we can correct the difference between the calculated and actual measurements of the solar eclipse time through observation. Therefore, whenever there is a solar eclipse, astronomers often carry dozens of boxes of instruments to places thousands of miles away for observation. For example, when a solar eclipse occurred on June 19, 1936, two teams of Chinese astronomers went to Bo Li in Siberia and Hokkaido in Japan to observe it. The solar eclipse on September 21, 1941, occurred during the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, the path of totality happened to cross the densely populated mainland of our country, so two teams of Chinese astronomers disregarded all difficulties and went to Lintao in Gansu and Chong'an in Fujian to conduct observations. We also went to Yuhang in Zhejiang to observe the solar eclipse on May 9, 1948, but clouds hindered our work. Next year, a total solar eclipse can be seen in the Soviet Union, and we will try to go there for observation. This is an excellent opportunity to learn from Soviet astronomers. The year after next (1955), a total solar eclipse lasting more than seven minutes can be seen in the vicinity of Vietnam on June 20. At that time, we can conduct observations in a leisurely manner.

The Moon's orbit around the Earth (the Moon's orbit) and the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic) are not on the same plane. During the new moon of each lunar month, the Moon is sometimes above the Earth's orbital plane (as shown in 3 in the figure) and sometimes below the orbital plane (as shown in 2 in the figure), so no solar eclipse occurs; but at least twice a year, the Moon and the Earth are almost on the same orbital plane (as shown in 1 and 4 in the figure), and then a solar eclipse occurs.

    二月十四日的日偏食
    中国科学院南京紫金山天文台台长　张钰哲
    编者按：今年二月十四日（夏历正月初一）将发生日食的现象。这是自然的现象。我们刊登这篇文章就是为了解释日食的科学道理的。今天（一月三十日）早晨各地会看到月全食。它和日食一样，也是一种自然现象。有时候，地球正好转到太阳和月球中间，如果太阳、地球和月亮在一条直线上，月亮走进了地球的黑影里，地球把太阳射到月球去的光给挡住了，就发生了月食。但是，在月亮已经全食的时候，我们还可以看见一个模模糊糊、暗淡无光的月亮。这是因为地球周围有一层空气，太阳光透过这层空气的时候，发生了折光，仍然有一部分光线会射到月亮上去的缘故。
    今年二月十四日，全国各地（除掉极西的边疆省份）几乎都可以在这天的早晨看到日食的现象。这次日食，只是偏食而不是全食。换句话说，月亮不是把太阳全部遮盖起来，使白天变成黑夜。你如果在房间里工作的话，不会感觉到天象方面起了什么变化。
    今年这次日食有些什么特点呢？这次日食和往年的日食一样，都是普通的自然现象，所不同的是，这次日食发生在二月十四日——夏历癸巳年的正月初一。我们民族的习惯，一向非常重视夏历元旦这一天，有些人以为这一天若是顺利，便一年里百事如意。因此，如果在正月初一看到太阳缺了一块，大家难免要大惊小怪，疑神疑鬼，认为它是不吉利的预兆。这种迷信思想至今还存在于部分群众中，值得我们注意。
    现在，我把这次日食的时刻和情况告诉大家。
    先就北京一个地方来谈。二月十四日（星期六）清早七时二十七分多一点的时候，月亮便开始遮盖太阳。不过，这时因为太阳才上升不久，还很靠近东南方的地平线上，不便于观测。以后太阳渐渐升高，月亮暗影侵入到太阳表面的部分便逐渐加大。一小时以后（八时二十七分），太阳被食部分达到了最大的程度。如果我们把太阳的直径分作十分的话，那末此时直径被月亮所遮盖的部分，达到六分多。从这个时候起，月亮就开始慢慢地离开太阳。到九时三十一分，太阳上面什么缺陷也没有了，而恢复到正常的状态。
    至于中国其他城市见到日食的情形，又是怎样呢？见到日食的时刻，一般地说，西方早于东方，南方早于北方（因为月亮由东向西移动，月影则由西向东移动，假若按同一时间计算，我国西方见到日食的时刻，比东方要早一些，同样，南方也早于北方。），但其相差时间大体上总不超过一小时。但在我国西部的城市，看不到初亏的现象，因为当太阳尚未升到地平线以上的时候，月亮已经开始把它遮掉一部分了。如果二月十四日是晴天，大家很可以在上午八、九点钟的时候，亲自去观察太阳，看一看我们的预言是否正确。但太阳光是很强烈的，用肉眼直接去了望它是不很合适的。我们可以用深颜色的眼镜或涂黑的玻璃进行观察，这样可以保护眼睛。此外，我们还可以用面盆盛清水，放在露天的地方，观察映在水里的太阳。
    日食发生在初一，是没有什么奇怪的。因为初一乃是日食最正常的日期（所有的日食都应当发生于初一），若不在初一，那才是怪事咧。夏历每个月的初一，通常称为朔日，便是月亮赶上太阳，达到相同经度的日子。我们都晓得，日月运行时，总是月亮绕地球走，而地球又绕着太阳走。为着简明起见，我们姑且就天上表面的现象来谈。太阳在各星象之间的行动，一年里走一周天。这路线我们称它作黄道。月亮在众星当中的移动，只要一个月便走了一周天。它的路线，可以叫作白道。假若天球上的白道和黄道重合在一起，那末每个月里，月亮一定要追上太阳一次，把它遮住，而发生一次日食。但事实上并非每逢初一，日月同经度的时候，就有日食。原因是天上的黄道、白道并不重合，而成互相交叉的两个大圈。黄道和白道两个平面，成了一个五度的角度。如果日月同经度的朔，恰好当太阳走到黄道和白道相距最远的地点发生，那么这时月亮和太阳虽是经度相同，而在天上的位置相距却很远。由我们看去，它们二者之间，还有相当于九个月亮那样长的间隔。月亮当然不能遮着太阳，而使它呈现日食了。不过，如果当太阳走到黄白道交点的附近，而遇见朔，那末月亮便可遮着太阳，而发生日食的现象。
    现在，我们已经了解了黄道上有相对（相距一百八十度）的两点，这便是和白道的交点。如果当太阳正走到交点附近时遇着朔，日食便要发生。交点附近能使日食发生的区域，到底有多大呢？我们计算出来，太阳要通过这个区域，需要走三十天以上的时间。三十天内至少必有一次朔，多则可以有两次朔。因此每逢太阳走到交点附近时，至少有一次日食，多则有两次日食。
    如果这两个交点在黄道上有固定的位置，那末每年里日食的发生，也有一定的时期。人们也就可以方便地预先推测日食的日期了。可是这两个交点在黄道上作与太阳相反方向的移动，只要十八年零几天便可沿着黄道绕行一周。假使太阳在一月初从升交点（太阳由南向北运行时所通过的黄白道交点）出发，那么六月下旬，便可走到降交点（太阳由北向南运行时所通过的黄白道交点），十二月中旬就又回到升交点来。因此一年之内，至少有二次日食，多则可以达到五次。但因为地球表面，只有一小部分地方能够看见日食，所以每年日食的次数虽多，但对某一个地方来说，就得经过许多年才有机会看见一次日食。相反地，月食是由于月亮跑到地球的影子里而发生的。地球上凡是看得到月亮的那个半球，都同时可以看到月食。每年里的月食，少则可以一次都没有，多则可以有三次。总之，每年里日月食总共的次数，最多不会超过七次。
    由我们看起来，太阳和月亮的大小，似乎差不多。其实，太阳的直径比月亮大四百倍，太阳和地球的距离比月亮和地球的距离约远四百倍，所以看起来好像一样大。月亮、地球、太阳彼此之间的距离，随时有更动，所以在人们的眼睛里看来，月亮有时可以比太阳略为大些，有时略为小些。因此月亮有时可以把太阳全部遮住，而发生全食；有时月亮只能遮住太阳的中部，而四周仍露出一线的太阳边缘，这便成了环食。只有在全食的时候，我们才看得到白天变黑夜、星星出现等现象。无论环食和偏食，只要有一小部分的太阳露在月亮的外边，天空总仍然是很亮的。
    天文学者对于日食，特别是日全食，尤其感到兴趣，因为太阳是天文学家的主要研究对象。而关于太阳上的某些问题，也只有在日全食的几分钟之间，才能进行观测和研究。比如，我们可从观察中修正日食时刻推算和实测之间的相差。所以，每逢日食的时候，天文学者往往携带几十箱的仪器，到几千里以外的地方去作观测。比如，一九三六年六月十九日发生日食时，中国的两队天文学者，曾分头到西伯利亚的伯力和日本的北海道去观测。一九四一年九月二十一日的日食，发生于抗日战争期间。但全食地带恰好横跨我们中国人烟稠密的本部，因此，中国的两队天文学者也曾不顾一切的困难到甘肃临洮和福建崇安进行了观测。一九四八年五月九日的日食，我们也曾到浙江馀杭进行观测，但阴云阻挠了我们的工作。明年在苏联境内可以看到日全食，我们将设法到那里去进行观察。这是向苏联天文学家学习的一个绝好机会。后年（一九五五年）六月二十日在越南一带可以看到时间长达七分多钟的日全食。那时，我们就可以从容不迫地进行观测了。（附图片）
    月亮绕地球的轨道（白道）和地球绕太阳的轨道（黄道）不在一个平面上。当夏历每月初一时，月亮有时在地球轨道面的上边（如图中3），有时在轨道面的底下（如图中2），因此就不发生日食；但一年至少有两次月亮和地球差不多同在一个轨道面上（如图中1和4），那时就发生了日食。
