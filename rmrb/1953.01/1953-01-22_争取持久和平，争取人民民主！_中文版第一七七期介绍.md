The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 177, has been published.

This issue, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the union of the Soviet Socialist Republics to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, publishes an editorial entitled "A Strong Fortress of Peace and International Security." The editorial points out: Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, it has demonstrated the great strength of a multi-ethnic socialist country. The Soviet Union is a model of fraternal cooperation among all nationalities to achieve the lofty goal of building communism. The great strength of the Soviet Socialist State is primarily due to the fact that it was built by the people themselves and receives their wholehearted support, guaranteeing the vigorous growth of all their material and spiritual forces. Secondly, in the struggle for the bright future of all nationalities and for world peace, the Soviet Union enjoys the boundless love and support of all working people and all progressive forces in the world. The foreign policy of the Soviet Union is a policy of peace.

This issue publishes an article by Li Lautu, member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union: "A Great Example Set by a Powerful Multi-Ethnic Socialist Country." Lautu points out: The establishment of the Soviet Union greatly influenced the worldwide struggle against national and colonial oppression. Lautu uses the situation in the Soviet Union as an example to illustrate the following Leninist-Stalinist viewpoints on the national question that must be observed. The national question is part of the general question of the proletarian revolution; therefore, to eliminate national oppression, there is no other way than to overthrow capitalism and establish socialism; it is necessary to help backward nations in terms of cultural and economic development, otherwise so-called national equality is just empty talk.

This issue publishes a paper entitled "The Indomitable Will of Peace-Loving Humanity," commenting on the World People's Peace Congress, as well as the declaration of the World People's Peace Congress and the letter to the governments of the Five Great Powers. The paper points out: The great international significance of the World People's Peace Congress is that the congress first demonstrated that the broad, non-partisan democratic movement for peace and international security has unprecedented mass character and powerful strength. Currently, countries are launching widespread movements to convey the resolutions of the congress and unite the broad masses of the people to struggle for the realization of the various demands of the congress. If the resolutions of the congress can be realized, under the current historical conditions, it will be a huge victory in the cause of peace.

Other articles published in this issue include: "A Great School of Ideological Education for Cadres" by H. Kozłowska, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; the report by F. Pillon, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on December 5, 1952: "The Party's Policy and the Struggle for Democratic Freedoms, National Independence, and Peace"; "Striving for Cuba's National Independence!" by B. Roca, General Secretary of the Socialist People's Party of Cuba.

Kozłowska's article introduces the situation of the Polish United Workers' Party leading the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and points out the experience in this study.

Pillon's article discusses the plight of the French people, their opposition to the French big capitalists colluding with American imperialism to sell out national sovereignty and threaten peace, and the French Communist Party's struggle for peace, democratic freedoms, and national independence. Pillon criticizes the opportunism and sectarianism of some members of the French Communist Party, pointing out: Some people still talk about the party being isolated, which shows that they have not seen the powerful forces that are currently being mobilized among the masses. Neglecting the actions of the masses and lacking confidence in the struggles of the masses leads to opportunism and sectarianism. Opportunism replaces the united action of the masses with parliamentary and other tricks that can lead one into a petty-bourgeois position. Sectarianism replaces the united action of the masses with the actions of a "small number of activists," which can lead to the most dangerous road of adventurism. We must increasingly demand the firm and thorough implementation of the party's correct political line. The article also criticizes the erroneous view of some people that it is possible to organize the struggle for democratic rights without communists. The article points out the main role played by the French Communist Party in this struggle.

Roca's article points out: The result of the reactionary military coup in Cuba on March 10, 1952, not only meant the cancellation of the constitution and democratic rights and democratic freedoms, but also meant that the process of American imperialism plundering Cuba's economy was accelerated. After the establishment of the Batista government, a series of traitorous measures were taken, which made Cuba's livestock industry, sugar industry, tobacco industry, foreign trade, etc., increasingly deteriorated. American imperialists are exerting great pressure in an attempt to secretly recruit and train Cuban youths to fight in Korea. The article points out: Despite all kinds of oppression and rumors, in Cuba, a powerful mass movement led by the working class and the Socialist People's Party—the Cuban Communist Party—is maturing, and broad united front committees are being established in various factories, sugarcane plantations, and rural areas. Despite the desperate resistance of the lackeys of American imperialism, this united front is becoming increasingly powerful. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一七七期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一七七期已经出版。
    本期为纪念各苏维埃共和国联合组成苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟三十周年，发表题为“和平与国际安全的坚强堡垒”的社论。社论指出：自从苏联成立以来，它表现了多民族的社会主义国家的巨大力量。苏联是各民族为了达到建设共产主义这一崇高目标而进行兄弟般合作的模范。苏维埃社会主义国家之所以有这样大的力量，首先便是由于它是由人民自己建造起来并得到他们全心全意的支持的，它保证了他们的一切物质力量和精神力量的蓬勃增长。其次是，苏联在争取各族人民的光辉前途和世界和平的斗争中，得到全世界所有劳动人民、一切进步力量的无限热爱和支持。苏联的外交政策是和平的政策。
    本期刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会委员利·劳图纪念苏联成立三十周年的文章：“强大的多民族的社会主义国家所树立的伟大榜样”。劳图指出：苏联的成立大大地影响了全世界反对民族压迫与殖民地压迫的斗争。劳图以苏联的情形做为榜样，说明在民族问题上必须遵守的列宁—斯大林关于民族问题的下述论点。民族问题是无产阶级革命总问题中的一部分，因此，要消灭民族压迫，除了推翻资本主义并且建立社会主义之外，别无其他出路；必须在文化和经济发展方面帮助落后的民族，否则所谓民族平等只不过是一句空话。
    本期发表了评述世界人民和平大会的题为“爱好和平的人类的不屈意志”的论文以及世界人民和平大会的宣言和致五大国政府书。论文指出：世界人民和平大会的伟大国际意义，是大会首先显示了争取和平与国际安全的广泛的非党派性的民主运动有着空前的群众性和强大的力量。目前各国正在展开广泛的运动来传达大会的决议并团结广大人民群众为实现大会各项要求而斗争。大会的决议如果能够实现，在当前的历史条件下，将是和平事业中一个巨大的胜利。
    本期刊载的其他文章有：波兰统一工人党中央委员会委员赫·科兹洛夫斯卡的“干部思想教育的伟大学校”；法国共产党政治局委员佛·皮佑一九五二年十二月五日在法国共产党中央委员会全体会议上的报告：“党的政策和争取民主自由、民族独立与和平的斗争”；古巴社会主义人民党总书记布·罗加的“争取古巴的民族独立！”
    科兹洛夫斯卡的文章介绍了波兰统一工人党领导学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件和斯大林的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的情况，并指出了这次学习中的经验。
    皮佑的文章论述了法国人民的困苦处境，他们反对法国大资本家勾结美帝国主义出卖国家主权和威胁和平的情形，以及法国共产党为和平、民主自由和民族独立的斗争。皮佑批判法国共产党若干党员的机会主义和宗派主义，指出：有人仍然谈什么党是孤立的，这就表明他们没有看见目前群众中正在行动起来的强大力量。由于轻视群众的行动，对于群众的斗争缺乏信心，就产生了机会主义和宗派主义。机会主义是用议会的以及其他会使人陷入小资产阶级立场的勾当来代替群众的联合行动。宗派主义是用“少数积极分子”的行动来代替群众的联合行动，这会走到最危险的冒险道路上去。我们必须越来越严格地要求坚定地、彻底地实现党的正确的政治路线。文章还批判了有些人的错误看法：没有共产党人也可能组织争取民主权利的斗争。文章指出了法国共产党人在这个斗争中所起的主要作用。
    罗加的文章指出：一九五二年三月十日古巴反动军事政变的结果，不仅意味着取消宪法和民主权利与民主自由，而且意味着美帝国主义掠夺古巴的经济过程加速了。巴蒂斯塔政府成立后采取了一系列的卖国措施，使古巴的饲畜业、制糖业、烟草业、对外贸易等日益恶化。美帝国主义者正在施加强大压力，以图秘密地招募和训练古巴青年到朝鲜去打仗。文章指出：尽管有着各种压迫和造谣，在古巴，一个以工人阶级和社会主义人民党——古巴共产主义的党——为首的强大的群众运动正在成熟中，广泛的联合阵线委员会正在各个工厂里、甘蔗种植园和农村里成立，尽管美帝国主义的走狗们拚命抵抗，这个联合阵线还是越来越强大了。 （新华社）
