Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: "Pravda" published an article by Suri Tongwanit, editor of the Thai newspaper "Thai Sound," who attended the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, entitled "Thai People Fight for Peace and National Independence."

    The author said: Although Thailand is nominally a free country, it has actually lost its political and economic independence. Since the reactionary military group in Thailand regained power through a coup, U.S. imperialism has more actively invaded Thailand under the guise of "economic assistance." As a result of this "assistance," the United States is using Thai troops to invade Korea and is establishing U.S. military bases on Thai territory. U.S. imperialists have also seized Thailand's foreign trade, stipulating in a servile agreement that all of Thailand's rubber must be exported to the United States. They have forbidden Thailand from trading with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, resulting in a sharp drop in the price of Thai rubber, the closure of many rubber-producing enterprises, and an increase in unemployment. Workers have united to call for the immediate cancellation of the U.S.-Thai rubber agreement and the lifting of the ban on rubber trade. They demand the establishment of trade relations with the Soviet Union and China on an equal footing.

    The author continued: The lives of the Thai people are becoming increasingly difficult; on the other hand, the people's political consciousness is rising. The movement for peace, democracy, freedom, and opposition to imperialist aggression is developing everywhere. Workers and peasants are participating in various democratic organizations to fight against U.S. imperialism. Workers are holding strikes to demand higher wages. Farmers are sending representatives to the capital to present their demands to the government.

    Students at Thammasat University have organized a student movement for peace. Tens of thousands of students from educational institutions across the country have joined this movement. Thai women have formed a democratic women's organization to fight for peace and the happiness of children.

    The author said: U.S. imperialists are attempting to slander the peace movement and provoke religious people against it. However, these attempts have completely failed. Despite such conspiracies by the United States, Buddhist monks have also joined the peace movement, and Dharma Tulata has become the vice-chairman of the Thai Peace Committee.

    In June of last year, the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference put forward suggestions, which have also become the program for the Thai people's struggle for peace and democracy.

    U.S. imperialists are doing everything possible to undermine the peace movement in Asia. They are sending representatives to the Asian and Pacific regions to conduct secret negotiations to increase the reactionary forces' attacks on the forces of peace. A representative of the U.S. Department of Defense came to Bangkok on November 1st of last year and held consultations with the Director of the Thai State Council.

    The Thai government has arrested many people who support peace. Among those arrested by the police are the chairman and vice-chairman of the Thai Peace Committee, the secretary of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and many journalists and other progressive people.

    The Thai people, regardless of persecution, are enthusiastically supporting the peace movement. In order to conceal the true purpose of arresting these people, the ruling group is falsely accusing those arrested of conspiring to betray the country.

    The author continued: Currently, many peace and democracy fighters are being held in prison, but they are not discouraged. They know that behind them is an army of hundreds of millions of peace supporters who will fight regardless of all obstacles until victory is achieved.

    苏联“真理报”发表泰国和平战士?素里·通哇匿的专文
    泰国人民为争取和平与民族独立而斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“真理报”发表了出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的泰国“泰声报”编辑?素里·通哇匿所写的一篇文章，题为“泰国人民为争取和平和民族独立而斗争”。
    作者说：虽然泰国在名义上是一个自由的国家，实际上已经丧失了政治和经济的独立。自从泰国的反动军事集团借着政变而重新登台以后，美帝国主义在“经济援助”的借口下更积极地侵入泰国。这种“援助”的结果，是美国利用泰国军队侵略朝鲜，并在泰国的领土上建立美国的军事基地。美帝国主义者还夺取了泰国的对外贸易，用一个奴役性的协定规定泰国的全部橡胶必须输往美国。他们禁止泰国和苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家进行贸易，结果使得泰国橡胶的价格暴跌，许多生产橡胶的企业倒闭，失业人数增加。工人们团结起来，呼吁立即取消美泰橡胶协定，解除关于橡胶贸易的禁令。他们要求和苏联及中国以平等的原则建立贸易关系。
    作者继续说：泰国人民的生活正日益困难；另一方面，人民的政治觉悟正在提高。争取和平、民主、自由和反对帝国主义侵略的运动到处在发展中，工人和农民正在参加对美帝国主义进行斗争的各种民主组织。工人们举行罢工，要求增加工资。农民派代表到首都向政府提出他们的要求。
    法政大学的学生组织了争取和平的学生运动。全国各教育机构有成千上万的学生参加了这个运动。泰国的妇女已组成了一个民主的妇女组织，为争取和平和儿童的幸福而斗争。
    作者说：美帝国主义者企图诬蔑和平运动，并挑起信教的民众对和平运动的反感。但是，他们的这些企图已完全失败了。尽管美国有这样的阴谋，佛教僧侣也参加了和平运动，塔马图塔法师当了泰国和平委员会的副主席。
    在去年六月，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议提出了建议，这些建议也成为泰国人民争取和平和民主的斗争纲领。
    美帝国主义者正千方百计地破坏亚洲的和平运动。他们派代表到亚洲及太平洋地区来进行秘密谈判，以增加反动派对和平力量的攻击。美国国防部的一个代表在去年十一月一日到曼谷来，并和泰国国务院院长进行会商。
    泰国政府逮捕了许多拥护和平的人士。在警察逮捕的人中，有泰国和平委员会的正副主席，总工会的书记和许多新闻记者及其他进步人士。
    泰国人民不顾迫害，正在热诚地拥护和平运动。统治集团为了掩饰它逮捕这些人的真正目的，正在诬告这些被捕的人阴谋叛国。
    作者继续说：目前有许多和平民主的战士被关在狱中，但他们并没有灰心。他们知道，在他们背后有几亿的和平拥护者的大军支持着他们，这些和平拥护者将不顾一切障碍而进行斗争，一直到获得胜利。
