    The American Reactionary Ruling Group Establishes Large Numbers of Concentration Camps
    The American reactionary ruling group is establishing large numbers of concentration camps, preparing to massively suppress progressive men and women, labor leaders, and peace fighters. The concentration camps, which are already completed and resemble ancient castles, are located in the following places: Tule Lake in California, El Reno in Oklahoma, Avon Park in Florida, Allenwood in Pennsylvania, Wickenburg and Florence in Arizona... According to American journalists who have visited these concentration camps, they are designed entirely according to Hitler's blueprints. From this, people can see that the Wall Street billionaires have hardly any good tricks besides using fascist terror tactics.
    
    French People Oppose American Occupation Troops
    "U.S. News & World Report" magazine says: On average, there are about twenty incidents per month of French people damaging the residences, buildings, or vehicles of American occupation troops distributed in 130 areas throughout France; there are also "several dozen" direct conflicts between French people and American troops each month, with an average of five of them being "major brawls."
    The French reactionary ruling group obsequiously invites the United States to occupy France; but the French people do not approve of this treacherous behavior.

    American "Guests" in Britain
    British Home Secretary Fyfe announced in the House of Commons on December 11 that the American military authorities in Britain have the right to summon British civilian witnesses to testify in military courts.
    Fyfe said: According to the "American Guest Forces Act," the American authorities have the right to summon civilian witnesses to testify in military courts.
    Fair-minded people will say: The American soldiers are no longer "guest troops." They have long since replaced the original masters of the British Isles.

    美国反动统治集团建立大批集中营
    美国反动统治集团正在建立大批集中营，准备大规模压制进步男女、劳工领袖与和平战士。现在已经完工的像古代城堡似的集中营已有下面数处地方：加利福尼亚州的图列湖，奥克拉哈马州的埃尔·里诺，佛罗里达州的阿旺公园，宾夕凡尼亚州的阿伦森林，阿里佐纳州的威根堡和佛罗伦斯……。据访问过这些集中营的美国记者报道，它们完全是按照希特勒的图样设计的。从这里人们可以看出：华尔街的亿万富翁们除下使用法西斯恐怖手段外，很难有别的什么好法宝了。
    法国人民反对美国占领军
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说：法国人民对分布在全法国一百三十个地区的美国占领军的住宅、建筑或车辆的破坏事件每月平均约二十次；法国人民对美军的直接冲突事件每月也有“几打”，其中平均有五次是“大打出手”。
    法国的反动统治集团拱手请美国占领法国；但法国人民是不批准这种卖国行为的。
    美国“客人”在英国
    英国内政大臣费夫十二月十一日在下院宣布，美国驻英军事当局有权传唤英国平民证人到军事法庭作证。
    费夫说：根据“美国客军法案”，美国当局有权传唤平民证人到军事法庭作证。
    公正的人士会说：美国军人早已不是什么“客军”了。它早已取英伦三岛原来的主人而代之了。
