East China and Shanghai region's various building material supply units and transportation units are actively solving the production and transportation problems of building materials to ensure the needs of basic construction this spring.

The Materials Department of the East China Construction Engineering Department is formulating this year's supply plan for various building materials based on the required quantity of construction projects, and has taken necessary measures for some very scarce materials to strive for balance. For example, in order to ensure the timely supply of bricks and tiles required for basic construction in the first quarter, the department, according to the instructions of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the East China Financial and Economic Committee, mobilized farmers in Jiashan and other brick and tile producing areas through the local party committees and governments to carry out a crash program of winter brick making, and found specific methods for frost prevention from the masses, which is estimated to basically solve the brick supply required for the first quarter. The supply of tiles has also been undertaken by the state-owned Zhejiang Brick and Tile Factory No. 1 to utilize and improve existing equipment and conduct winter brick making on a trial basis.

The East China Coal Industry Building Materials Company and the East China Crushed Stone Company have investigated the quantity of wood, stones, and yellow sand required by various units in the first quarter and are actively preparing for supply. The nine building materials factories under the Factory Management Department of the East China Construction Engineering Department are also stepping up production. Wood Factory No. 1 is conducting a labor emulation campaign to ensure the completion of the processing of 20,000 doors and windows ahead of schedule; Yangzi Wood Factory has achieved initial success in using shavings and sawdust to trial-produce wood boards in order to save logs; various brick and tile factories are also adopting various advanced experiences to improve output and quality.

Regarding the transportation of materials, the East China Transportation Planning Committee and the East China Basic Construction Office held a meeting and made measures to ensure the completion of the transportation task. The Shanghai Railway Bureau has changed the original ordinary locomotives towing bricks and tiles from Jiashan to Shanghai to large locomotives since December 16 last year. The Jiashan County Finance and Economics Committee is preparing to concentrate local boats to rush to transport tiles and bricks before the autumn grain collection and transportation. In addition, relevant units are also strengthening loading and unloading forces, improving the turnover rate of ships and vehicles, and ensuring the completion of the contracted numbers. Therefore, the recent transportation volume of bricks and tiles has increased significantly. The bricks transported to Shanghai in the four days from December 16 to 19 increased by 61% compared with the previous four days of December 16, which has provided a strong guarantee for the progress of construction projects.

    华东地区器材供应及运输部门
    积极准备建筑材料保证基本建设需要
    华东及上海地区各个建筑材料的供应单位和运输单位为保证今春基本建设的需要，正积极解决建筑材料的生产和运输问题。
    华东建筑工程部材料处正根据建筑工程的需要量，制订今年度各项建筑材料的供应计划，对某些十分缺乏的材料已采取必要措施，力求平衡。如为保证第一季度基本建设所需砖瓦的及时供应，该部曾根据中共中央华东局及华东财政经济委员会的指示，通过嘉善等砖瓦产地的党委和政府大力动员制坯农民突击冬季制坯工作，并从群众中找出了防冻的具体办法，估计可基本解决第一季度所需要的砖头供应问题。瓦的供应也已由国营浙江砖瓦一厂利用和改善现有设备，试行冬季制坯。
    华东煤业建筑器材公司、华东轧石公司已调查了各单位第一季度所需的木材、石子、黄沙的数量，积极筹备供应。华东建筑工程部工厂管理处所属九个建筑材料工厂也正加紧生产中。木材一厂正进行劳动竞赛，保证提前完成二万户门窗加工任务；扬子木材厂为了节省原木，利用刨花、木屑试制木板，获得初步成功；各个砖瓦厂亦正采用各种先进经验，提高产量和品质。
    关于材料的运输问题，华东运输计划委员会与华东基本建设办公室曾召开会议，作出了保证完成运输任务的措施。上海铁路局已于去年十二月十六日起将原来曳引嘉善至上海的砖瓦的普通机车改为大型机车，嘉善县财政经济委员会准备在秋征运粮之前，集中当地船只全力突击抢运瓦砖。此外，有关单位亦正加强装卸力量，提高船只及车辆运转率，保证完成承运数字。因此，最近砖瓦运输量已有显著提高，十二月十六日至十九日四天内运到上海的砖较十六日的前四天增加了百分之六十一，这使建筑工程的进展得到了有力的保证。
