    The most significant characteristic of the situation in Western Europe at the end of 1952 was the rapid economic decline and the deepening crisis. The people's living standards were declining day by day. In Britain, seven years after the end of the war, a strict rationing system for daily consumer goods was still in place; and because of the need to reduce imports, the rations were repeatedly reduced. In France, inflation, wage freezes, and high prices were the hallmarks of the Pinay government's policies. Unemployment soared, especially in the textile and automobile industries. In Italy, more than three million unemployed and millions of impoverished peasants (especially in the south of the peninsula) were trapped in unprecedented misery. Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Spain were shrouded in the terror of fascist dictatorships for the benefit of a small group of profit-seekers and professional murderers. These are the results of the "Marshall Plan" and the famous "Truman Doctrine," which have been implemented for several years to open up an "American Century" in Europe.

    While the people are suffering, the governments of various countries are engaged in fierce infighting, vying to be Washington's favorite servant. They all want to prove that they are the most trustworthy in order to get some extra alms in dollars. At the same time, the contradictions between European capitalism and American monopoly capitalists are becoming increasingly acute. The policy of American monopoly capitalists selling without buying has reached a lamentable end. The economies of many European countries, especially France and Italy, have been transformed into colonial or semi-colonial economies, which are increasingly opposed by a section of the ruling class. A few months ago, the Pinay government strongly protested against the United States' refusal to fulfill its promise to grant France $600 million in "overseas" orders for war materials. French capitalists had originally planned to use these orders to keep their factories running this winter (1952), but it is clear that American capitalists would rather have American factories manufacture these war materials. In fact, this further exposes one of the goals of American monopoly capitalists, which is to export the American crisis to Europe and use every possible means to delay the arrival of the total collapse of the American economy. The economic competition of West Germany with the help of American capitalists has further complicated the situation. Britain has found that it has not only lost its European market but also lost a large part of its traditional market in the Middle East. The recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference showed that the Commonwealth itself is threatened with disintegration due to American competition. The situation is only getting worse. It has now been proven that the US government's war policy and the war in Korea cannot alleviate the US crisis and will prepare the conditions for a deeper crisis. As a result, American monopoly capitalists are becoming more and more greedy, while European capitalists are also demanding a greater share of the profits brought about by the arms policy. The economic crisis in the Marshallized countries of Europe fully proves Stalin's analysis: French and British capitalists will try to get rid of American control to ensure their maximum profits.

    The economic crisis has its impact on military, political, and public opinion aspects.

    In the military field, the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council showed that the aggressive war bloc cannot complete the arms expansion plan formulated in Lisbon. The original plan was to establish 75 divisions in 1953, but it has now been changed to 63 divisions. However, in reality, even this number cannot be reached for the most part, and it is just talk on paper. American experts admit that it will be difficult for the aggressor bloc's troops to reach that number before 1956. Organizing the so-called "European Army" is encountering more and more difficulties. America's European partners fear the huge influence of German militarists in the alliance. Public opinion protesting against the rearmament of Germany is so strong that even reactionary politicians have to be concerned. Therefore, the general treaty of war signed with the Bonn government has not yet been submitted to the French parliament for approval.

    In an attempt to resolve this increasingly difficult situation, American imperialists are openly relying on the fascist regimes of Yugoslavia, Spain, Greece, and Turkey. US imperialism is forcing the French and West German regimes to step up their fascistization, but at the same time, they are waving the banner of the "Free Crusade," thus completely tearing off their masks and opening the eyes of the millions of people who have been deceived by anti-Soviet propaganda and believed in the myth of American "democracy."

    Anti-American sentiment is growing so rapidly throughout Western Europe that even newspapers like the "New York Times" have recently had to admit that this is a very serious problem for the United States. The rude and arrogant behavior of the American occupying forces, the increasingly shameless interference of American diplomats in the internal affairs of various countries, various exorbitant taxes, especially the forced requisition of land to build airports, have aroused protests from people of all walks of life. The American henchmen in Europe have been severely hit. "Neutralism" has reached government circles. Especially in France, the prospect brought about by the US aggressive strategy in Europe has also greatly worried a section of the ruling class. In fact, American imperialists do not hide that in the first stage of the war, they may be forced to abandon the European continent, and after the atomic bombing, they will slowly try to reoccupy it. This prospect is naturally frightening for the masses, but it is not necessarily wonderful for the ruling class, because they are both afraid of the atomic bomb—it doesn't matter if you are a "friend" or an enemy—and afraid of the Soviet army occupying Europe. Those neutralists say: "Capitalism may be saved, but what about us? Not everyone has a seat on the last plane to New York." Such concerns are openly expressed even by newspapers like "Le Monde," which has always represented the views of the French big bourgeoisie; and American imperialists cannot but care about this, so that Eisenhower accused France of being a country with "low morale" not long before participating in the election. For him, the standard of high or low morale in various countries is whether they are willing to die for Wall Street...

    The United States is becoming increasingly weak, and now only the group of police and employed spies is left. On the contrary, the peace movement has gained significant development. A part of the public opinion that was originally indifferent or even hostile has gradually adopted the propositions of the World People's Peace Congress in the past year, especially the argument that the socialist system and the capitalist system can and must coexist peacefully.

    The fact that French writer Jean-Paul Sartre attended the Vienna Peace Congress is particularly meaningful. Sartre's influence on a section of French intellectuals is undeniable, and he was once a strong advocate of anti-Marxist philosophy, which was fiercely attacked by the French Communist Party. It is of great significance that he went to Vienna and delivered a speech there in favor of peaceful coexistence. People can also see that among the vast Catholics in France and Italy, many people have awakened to support peace. Some Catholic bishops have brazenly prevented certain Catholics from participating in the peace movement or threatened them with excommunication, but to no avail. There are many priests in France who are members of the Peace Committee, and some clergymen have been subjected to shameless persecution by the barbaric police because they marched with the people of Paris to oppose General Ridgway, the executioner of the Korean War, arriving in France.

    The fascistization of the French regime has打击[dǎjī] dealt a blow to democratic organizations and the peace movement, but it has also made the reactionaries who serve American imperialism more and more isolated. This development was particularly significant after the arrest of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos in May of this year (1952) and his release due to unanimous protests from all walks of life. The recent movement demanding the release of Alain Le Léap, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, who was arrested for waging a heroic struggle against the Vietnam War, has led millions of men and women to resolutely demand an end to the crimes of the French colonialists.

    Under such conditions, the French Communist Party issued a historic call to support the organization of a "National United Front" to unite the vast majority of the French people, regardless of political and religious beliefs, regardless of social class, to jointly fight for the establishment of a government that restores French independence and democratic freedom. We believe that the pressure of the masses on the parliament can and should promote policy changes and make France return to the peace camp. But we have not failed to see the difficulties in the struggle. The growing contradictions within the European aggressive bloc have not reduced the danger of war. Eisenhower's election as President of the United States is a new proof. In despair, American imperialism may attempt to take a desperate adventure even though it knows that victory is hopeless. We are well aware of the serious dangers we face, because France is located on the Atlantic coast and is a "landing zone." That is why we do not separate our struggle from the struggle of the people of the world for peace. A deep understanding of the unity and strength of the world peace camp is one of the decisive factors in the situation in Western Europe.

    As reflected in the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in peace have deeply moved the people of all countries. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the strengthening of the Sino-Soviet alliance are decisive factors for the people of European countries to assess the general situation in the world. The people of European countries are watching Korea, where the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers have proved that the army of the most powerful industrial country in the capitalist world is not invincible. The French people salute the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army, and they are proving every day that the "dirty war" is not only sinful but also absurd.

    Following the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the Vienna Conference showed the universality and globality of the struggle for peace. The struggle will be arduous, but we firmly believe that we will be able to hold our front line in Europe in the peace camp. And in France, we must fulfill the promise of our General Secretary of the French Communist Party, our dear Comrade Thorez: "The French people do not want to, and will never fight against the Soviet Union."

    西欧和法国局势
    法国共产党机关报“人道报”
    国际栏主笔  皮埃尔·古达德
    一九五二年年底西欧局势最显著的特点，就是经济的迅速衰退和危机的加深。人民生活水平一天比一天下降。在英国，战争结束了七年，仍然严格实行着日用消费品的配给制度；而且因为要削减进口，配给量一再减少。在法国，通货膨胀、工资冻结和物价高涨，是比内政府的政策的特征。失业激增，尤以纺织工业和汽车工业部门最为严重。在意大利，有三百万以上的失业者和几百万的贫苦农民
    （特别在半岛的南部），他们都陷于空前未有的悲惨状况中。土耳其、希腊、南斯拉夫和西班牙，为了一小撮利润追求者和职业杀人犯的利益而被法西斯独裁的恐怖所笼罩。这些都是几年来实行想在欧洲开辟“美国世纪”的“马歇尔计划”和著名的
    “杜鲁门主义”的结果。
    当人民痛苦万状的时候，各国的政府却在进行着剧烈的倾轧，争当华盛顿的宠仆。他们大家都想证明自己是最值得信任的，以便讨得一些美元的额外施舍。同时欧洲资本主义和美国垄断资本家之间的矛盾却日益尖锐化。美国垄断资本家卖而不买的政策已到了可悲的末路。欧洲许多国家，特别是法国和意大利的经济转为殖民地或半殖民地的经济，受到一部分统治阶级日益增长的反对。几个月以前，比内政府强烈抗议美国拒绝履行曾经答应给予法国六亿美元战争物资“海外”订货的诺言。法国的资本家本来打算今年（一九五二年）冬天靠这笔订货来维持他们工厂的开工的，但是事情很明显，美国的资本家是宁愿美国的工厂来制造这些战争物资。实际上这就愈加清楚地暴露了美国垄断资本家的目的之一，是要把美国的危机向欧洲输出，用尽一切可能的手段来延缓美国经济总崩溃的到临。西德在美国资本家的扶助下进行经济竞争，使得局势更加复杂。英国发觉它不仅丧失了欧洲的市场，而且丧失了中东的一大部分传统市场。最近举行的英联邦总理会议中显示出，由于美国的争夺，英联邦本身也受到了分崩离析的威胁。局势只有愈趋严重。现在业已证明美国政府的战争政策和在朝鲜进行的战争绝不能缓和美国的危机，而且将为更深重的危机准备条件。其结果是美国垄断资本家愈来愈贪心无厌，而欧洲的资本家却同时要求分享较多的军备政策所带来的利润。欧洲马歇尔化各国的经济危机充分证明了斯大林的分析：法国和英国的资本家将力图摆脱美国的控制，以保证他们的最大利润。
    经济危机对于军事、政治和舆论等各方面都有它的影响。
    在军事方面，最近举行的北大西洋公约理事会会议，显示出侵略战争集团不能完成在里斯本所拟订的扩军计划。原定一九五三年建立七十五个师，现已改为六十三个师。但是实际上连这个数目大半也不能达到的，只是纸上谈兵而已。美国的专家承认侵略集团的军队在一九五六年前难望凑够。组织所谓“欧洲军”遇到了愈来愈多的困难。美国的欧洲伙伴害怕德国军国主义者在联盟中的庞大势力。人民舆论抗议重新武装德国是如此强烈，使得反动的政客们也不得不有所顾虑。因此，与波恩政府签订的战争的一般性条约，到现在还未提交法国议会批准。
    美国帝国主义者为了企图解救这样愈来愈困难的局面，就公开依靠南斯拉夫、西班牙、希腊和土耳其的法西斯政权。美帝国主义迫使法国和西德的政权加紧法西斯化，可是他们同时又一面打着“自由十字军”的旗帜，这样他们的假面具便完全被拆穿了，使那些曾受反苏宣传欺骗和相信美国“民主”神话的千百万人民睁开了眼睛。
    反美情绪在整个西欧如此迅速地增长，像“纽约时报”这样的报纸最近也不得不承认这对于美国是
    一个非常严重的问题。美国占领军的粗暴蛮横，美国外交人员对各国内政愈来愈无耻的干涉，各种横征暴敛，特别是强征土地修筑机场等，激起了社会各阶层人民的抗议。欧洲的美国党羽受到了严重打击。“中立主义”直达政府圈子中。特别是在法国，美国在欧洲的侵略战略所带来的远景，使得一部分统治阶级也大为忧虑。实际上美国帝国主义者也并不隐瞒，战争的第一阶段他们可能被迫放弃欧洲大陆，而等到经过原子弹的大轰炸之后，再慢慢
    设法重新把它占领。这种远景自然要引起人民群众
    的恐惧，但是对于统治阶级也不见得是美妙的，因
    为他们既害怕原子弹——它不管你是“朋友”或敌
    人——又害怕苏军占领欧洲。那些中立主义者说：
    “资本主义也许是可以挽救的，可是我们怎样呢？
    在飞往纽约的最后一架飞机上不是所有的人都有位
    置的。”这样的忧虑，像一向代表法国大资产阶级观
    点的“世界报”那样的报纸也公开表露；而美国帝
    国主义者对此不能不关怀，以致艾森豪威尔在参加竞选之前不久曾经指责法国是一个“民气低落”的国家。对于他来说，各国民气高低的标准即是否愿意为华尔街效死……
    美国的日益削弱，现在几乎只剩警察和雇用特务的集团了。与此相反，和平运动却获得重大的发展。有一部分本来无所谓的甚至持着敌视态度的舆论，一年来也逐渐采取了世界人民和平大会的主张特别是赞成社会主义制度和资本主义制度能够而且必须和平共处的论点。
    法国作家让·保罗·萨特出席维也纳和平大会这一件事特别有意义。萨特对于一部分法国知识分子的影响是不可忽视的，他曾经是法国共产党所激烈攻击的一派反马克思主义哲学的健将。他到维也纳去，并在那里发表了一篇赞成和平共处的演讲，那是有很大意义的。人们也可以看到在法国和意大利广大的天主教徒中，有许多人觉悟起来拥护和平。有些天主教的主教对于参加和平运动的某些教徒，悍然制止或以逐出教会来威胁他们，都没有效果。法国有许多神父是和平委员会的委员，并且有一些教士因为和巴黎的人民一同游行反对朝鲜战争的刽子手李奇微将军到达法国，而遭到野蛮的警察的无耻迫害。
    法国政权法西斯化，打击了民主组织与和平运动，但也使得替美国帝国主义服役的反动派愈来愈孤立。这种发展在今年（一九五二年）五月法国共产党书记杜克洛被捕以及由于各阶层舆论一致抗议而获释的事件以后特别显著。最近要求释放因反对越南战争进行英勇斗争而被捕的总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普的运动，带动了好几百万的男女坚决要求制止法国殖民者的罪行。
    在这样的条件之下，法国共产党发出了一项历史性的号召，号召支持组织一个“全国统一阵线”以团结法国最大多数的人民，不分政治和宗教信仰、不分社会阶级，共同为建立一个恢复法国独立与民主自由的政府而奋斗。我们相信群众对议会的压力是能够而且应该促成政策的改变，使法国重新站到和平阵营方面来。但是我们并非没有看见斗争中的困难。欧洲侵略集团内部日益增长的矛盾，并没有减少战争的危险性。艾森豪威尔当选美国总统就是一个新的证明。在绝望中的美国帝国主义虽然明知胜利无望，但还可能企图进行孤注一掷的冒险的。我们深知我们面临着严重的危险，因为法国地处大西洋之滨，是“登陆地带”。这就是为什么我们不把我们的斗争和世界人民争取和平的斗争分开的原故。对世界和平阵营的团结一致及其力量之强大有深刻的了解。是西欧局势决定性因素之一。
    正如苏联共产党第十九次代表大会中所反映出的，苏联在和平中所取得的伟大成就，深深感动了各国人民。中国人民革命的胜利、中苏同盟的加强，是欧洲各国人民估量世界一般局势的决定性的因素。欧洲各国人民注视着朝鲜，在那儿朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军已证明了：资本主义世界最强大的工业国的军队并不是不可战胜的。法国人民向越南人民军的胜利致敬，他们每天都在证明着那个
    “肮脏的战争”不仅是罪恶的，而且是荒谬的。
    继亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议之后，维也纳的大会显示了争取和平的斗争的普遍性和世界性。斗争将是艰苦的，但是我们坚决相信我们一定能够在和平阵线中坚守住我们在欧洲的战线。而在法国来说，我们一定执行我们法国共产党总书记、我们亲爱的多列士同志的诺言：“法国人民不愿，也永不对苏联作战。”
