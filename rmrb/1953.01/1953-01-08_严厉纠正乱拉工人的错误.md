Short commentary:

    Recently, some construction departments in Beijing, Suiyuan and other places, for the benefit of their own units, disregarded national policies and laws, and even adopted methods such as arbitrarily increasing welfare benefits and raising wages to poach construction workers everywhere. As a result, not only did the existing workers flow around and jump factories, disrupting the state's plan for fixed workers and affecting the preparation work for capital construction, but also farmers blindly flowed to the cities, hindering agricultural production.
    This fact of randomly recruiting workers shows that the departmentalism of these capital construction departments has reached an extremely serious level! In order to complete the construction tasks of their own units, they do not hesitate to disrupt the work of fixed workers in other departments, affect ongoing projects, and disintegrate some rural autumn harvest mutual aid groups. In their view, the interests of their own unit are above all else, as if only the construction tasks of their own unit are national construction, and the work of any other department is not needed by the country and the people, and therefore should be subordinate to themselves. These people who have committed the error of departmentalism may think that their work is not for themselves, but for the country, so even if they make mistakes, they are still worthy of it. In fact, they have not realized that their departmentalist approach affects the construction tasks of other departments, which will cause great harm to the entire national construction cause!
    This fact of randomly recruiting workers also shows that the illegal and undisciplined behavior of these departments has developed to an intolerable point! In order to recruit more workers, these departments can not choose the objects of recruitment, can ignore national policies, and can violate national discipline. They feel that they have the power to control the state's economic expenditure, so they can do whatever they want, without considering economic accounting, without calculating project costs, and arbitrarily use methods such as increasing welfare benefits and raising wages to "recruit soldiers and buy horses" and poach workers. Even Bi, the chief of the capital construction section of the 45333 factory, incited workers to obstruct the investigation work when the Beijing Municipal People's Government investigated their illegal and undisciplined behavior. This kind of anarchic, unorganized and undisciplined behavior has developed to an intolerable point. They have completely forgotten that they are agents of the state and that they should do their work in accordance with national policies and laws, and should not undermine policies and laws, making themselves "free men" who are not subject to any constraints.
    In order to correct the mistake of randomly recruiting workers, leading cadres of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government, the Electricity Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, and the Guihua Municipal People's Government should immediately conduct strict inspections and order the responsible personnel to make self-criticisms. Among them, people like Bi, the chief of the 45333 factory, must be punished.

### 严厉纠正乱拉工人的错误

    严厉纠正乱拉工人的错误
    最近北京、绥远等地的一些建筑部门，为了本单位的利益，不顾国家的政策和法令，竟然采取任意提高福利待遇、增高工资的方法，到处抢拉建筑工人。结果不但使得现有工人到处流动，纷纷跳厂，打乱了国家固定工人的计划，影响了基本建设的准备工作，同时使得农民盲目地向城市流动，妨碍了农业生产。
    这种乱拉工人的事实，表明这些基本建设部门的本位主义已经达到极严重程度了！他们为了完成本单位的建设任务，竟至不惜破坏别的部门固定工人的工作，影响正在进行的工程，瓦解若干农村的秋收互助组。在他们看来，本单位的利益高于一切，好像只是本单位的建设任务，才是国家的建设，而任何其他部门的工作，都不是国家和人民所需要的，因此也都应该服从于自己。这些犯了本位主义错误的人，也许以为自己的工作总不是为了自己，而是为了国家，因此虽然犯了错误，仍然当之无愧。其实，他们没有认识到，他们这种本位主义的做法，影响了别的部门的建设任务，也就给整个国家建设事业造成莫大的损害！
    这种乱拉工人的事实，还表明这些部门的违法乱纪的行为，已经发展到不能令人容忍的地步了！这些部门为了多招收工人，可以不选择招收工人的对象，可以不管国家的政策，可以违反国家的纪律。他们觉得自己掌握着国家经济的开支大权，就可以胡干，可以不讲求经济核算，不计算工程成本，任意用提高福利待遇、增高工资的方法，来“招兵买马”，抢拉工人。甚至四五三三三厂基本建设科的毕科长，在北京市人民政府调查他们违法乱纪的行为时，还鼓动工人，阻难调查工作。这种无政府无组织无纪律的行为，已经发展到令人难以容忍的地步。他们完全忘记了自己是国家的代理人，自己应该按照国家的政策和法令来做好工作，而不应该破坏政策法令，使自己成为一个不受任何约束的“自由人”。
    为了纠正乱拉工人的错误，中央人民政府第二机械工业部、中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局、中央人民政府重工业部、归绥市人民政府等部门的领导干部，都应该立即进行严格的检查，责成负责人员做出检讨。其中像四五三三三厂的毕科长等，必须受到处分。
