Heroes of the Shangganling Victory (II)
  　Made by Xiye
    Sun Zhanyuan, the platoon leader of the 3rd platoon of the 7th company of a certain unit, a Yang Gensi-style hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, had his legs broken in a blocking battle. However, he continued to direct the battle and captured the position. Afterwards, he single-handedly used two machine guns to repel the enemy's counterattack. When the bullets ran out and the enemy charged, he pulled the fuse of his only remaining hand grenade, rolled into the enemy ranks, and killed the charging enemies, sacrificing himself heroically.

    上甘岭大捷中的英雄们（二）
  　西野　作
    中国人民志愿军杨根思式的英雄某部七连三排排长孙占元，在一次阻击战中，两条腿被打断了，但他继续指挥作战，夺取了阵地后，他一个人又用两挺机枪打退敌人的反扑。最后子弹打完了，当敌人冲上来时，他就拉开仅有的一颗手榴弹的导火线，滚进敌人群中，炸死了冲上来的敌人，自己也壮烈地牺牲了。
