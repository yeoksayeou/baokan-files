Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 4th: The entire command, combat personnel, and staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV), filled with victorious confidence, are joyously and enthusiastically welcoming the arrival of 1953 on the Korean front.

　　1952 was a year of glorious victory. In this year, the Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, annihilated more than 240,000 enemy troops; and with the full support of the people of the motherland, improved equipment and transport supplies, and established a young and heroic People's Air Force, tank units, and artillery units; and used tremendous labor to build an incomparably solid "Underground Great Wall," making it impossible for the American invading army to advance an inch. In summarizing and reviewing the victories of the past year, everyone felt infinitely happy.

　　On December 30, all cadres of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers held an evening party to welcome the New Year. Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department, reported on the political work of the past year at the meeting. He warmly congratulated all the cadres present on the glorious victories of the entire army in this year and the power of political work in guaranteeing victory. He called on all political workers to mobilize more vigorously and strive to meet the more arduous, greater, and more glorious combat tasks of 1953. On New Year's Day, the Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a New Year's gathering of cadres. Deputy Commander Deng Hua spoke at the meeting, reviewing the situation on the Korean battlefield in 1952 and the great victories of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and congratulating all the cadres for their contributions to this victory. Deputy Commander Deng made an estimate of the future development of the Korean War in 1953, pointing out that the American aggressors not only deliberately intend to continue the Korean War, but are also plotting to expand the war of aggression. Deng Hua said: "1953 will be a year in which the Chinese and Korean People's Armies will achieve greater and more glorious victories. On the basis of past victories, our army will certainly be able to complete the new and greater tasks of 1953, resolutely and thoroughly smash any military offensive by the enemy, and defend peace in the Far East and the world."

　　On New Year's Day, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a grand award ceremony, awarding various medals entrusted by the Korean government to division and regiment-level cadres who had made outstanding contributions. These cadres unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Korean people and the Korean government for the internationalist honor they had given them. They vowed to work hard to improve their command capabilities in 1953, lead their troops to fight well, and strive for greater victories.

　　On New Year's Eve, the soldiers on the forward positions listened to the broadcast of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. When the radio station announced the beginning of 1953, everyone cheered loudly, "Long live the people of the motherland! Long live Chairman Mao!" On the eastern front, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side, sent representatives to each other at the end of the year to offer condolences and congratulations, and exchanged New Year's gifts. A certain unit of the Korean People's Army sent an amateur drama troupe composed of outstanding company soldiers to a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers to give a performance, performing many self-written songs and dramas praising the unity of China and Korea, and also sent all the items in their company club as gifts to the Chinese People's Volunteers, including a woodcut of the national emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, portraits of General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Comrade Stalin in beautiful wooden frames, wall newspapers written on birch bark, drawings of various weapons, and exquisite daily necessities made by the soldiers from wood and shell casings. The Chinese People's Volunteers also presented pennants and a large amount of flour, meat, and daily necessities to the soldiers of the Korean People's Army. A certain unit of the Korean People's Army and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, guarding a certain position side by side, held a warm "Friendship Night" get-together on the front line on New Year's Eve. Chinese and Korean soldiers sat in a group in a shelter. The soldiers of the People's Army treated their international comrades with homemade rice cakes, bread, fresh mutton sent by the Mongolian people, and candies sent by the Hungarian people. Chinese and Korean soldiers sang "Song of General Kim Il-sung" and "The East is Red" in different languages. Most of the commanders and fighters of the artillery company of this People's Army unit participated in the Chinese People's Liberation War and shed blood for the Chinese people. Volunteer soldiers said: "You are old comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people!" They warmly congratulated each other on achieving greater success in the struggle against the common enemy in the new year, and expressed their confidence and determination to strive for final victory.

    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员和工作人员满怀着胜利信心，在朝鲜前线愉快而热烈地迎接了一九五三年的到来。
    一九五二年是一个辉煌的胜利的一年。中国人民志愿军在这一年中和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，歼灭了敌人二十四万多名；并在祖国人民的全力支援下，改善了装备和运输供应，建立了年轻而英勇的人民空军、坦克部队和炮兵部队；并用巨大的劳动建筑了无比巩固的“地下长城”，使美国侵略军寸步难进。在总结和回顾这一年来的胜利时，每一个人都怀着无限欢欣的心情。
    十二月三十日，中国人民志愿军政治部全体干部举行了迎接新年的晚会。政治部副主任杜平在会上报告了一年来政治工作。他向到会的全体干部热烈祝贺全军在这一年中的辉煌胜利和政治工作在保证胜利上所发挥的威力。他号召全体政治工作人员要更加紧张地动员起来，为迎接一九五三年更艰巨、更伟大、更光荣的战斗任务而奋斗。元旦，中国人民志愿军司令部和政治部举行了干部团拜会，副司令员邓华在会上讲话，他回顾一九五二年朝鲜战场的形势和朝中人民军队的伟大胜利，并祝贺全体干部对这一胜利所作的贡献。邓副司令员对一九五三年朝鲜战争的发展前途作了估计，指出美国侵略者不仅蓄意继续进行朝鲜战争，而且正在阴谋扩大侵略战争。邓华说：“一九五三年将是中朝人民军队取得更伟大、更光辉的胜利的一年，在以往胜利的基础上，我军必能完成一九五三年新的更伟大的任务，坚决地、彻底地粉碎敌人的任何军事进攻，保卫远东和世界和平。”

    除夕，前沿阵地上的战士们收听北京中央人民广播电台的广播，当广播电台宣布一九五三年开始的时候，大家齐声欢呼祖国人民万岁，毛主席万岁。在东部前线并肩作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在年底互派代表进行慰问和祝贺，互相赠送新年礼物，朝鲜人民军某部派出一个优秀的连队战士业余剧团到中国人民志愿军某部进行慰问演出，表演了许多自己编写的歌颂中朝团结的歌曲和戏剧，并且还把自己连队俱乐部里的全部物品当作礼物送给中国人民志愿军，其中有木刻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国徽，有装在美丽的木框中的金日成将军、毛泽东主席和斯大林同志的画像，有用桦树皮当作纸张写的壁报，有各种武器的图画和战士们用木头、炮弹壳做的精巧的日用品。中国人民志愿军也赠送了锦旗和许多面、肉以及日用品给朝鲜人民军的战士们。并肩守卫在某处阵地上的朝鲜人民军某部和中国人民志愿军某部在除夕举行了热烈的火线“亲善之夜”联欢。中朝战士们团团坐在一个掩蔽部里，人民军战士用自做的米糕、面包和蒙古人民送来的鲜羊肉、匈牙利人民送来的糖款待国际战友。中朝战士们用不同的语言合唱着“金日成将军之歌”和“东方红”。这个人民军部队中炮兵连的指挥员、战斗员大部分参加过中国人民解放战争，曾经为中国人民流过鲜血。志愿军战士说：“你们是中国人民的老战友了！”他们互相热烈地祝贺在新的一年反对共同敌人的斗争中取得更大的成就，并互相表示争取最后胜利的信心和决心。
