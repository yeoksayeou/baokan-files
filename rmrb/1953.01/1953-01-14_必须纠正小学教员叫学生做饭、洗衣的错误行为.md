Editor's Note: According to reader letters, the phenomenon of rural elementary school teachers asking elementary school students to cook and do laundry is very common.

The Erroneous Behavior of Elementary School Teachers Asking Students to Cook and Do Laundry Must Be Corrected

The reasons for this phenomenon are roughly twofold: On the one hand, these teachers have forgotten that the task the state has given them is to cultivate and educate the next generation, rather than disregarding students' health and studies and arbitrarily ordering elementary school students to serve them personally. It is hoped that these teachers will conduct a self-examination ideologically and correct their actions. On the other hand, rural elementary school teachers have heavy teaching responsibilities, and it is indeed difficult to bear the burden of milling grain and cooking alone. Therefore, local education administrative organs should consider ways to solve this practical problem. It should be pointed out that the task of teachers is to cultivate and educate the next generation, and the task of students is to study well. Any phenomenon that violates this principle is not allowed. It is recommended that the education sections of each county conduct an inspection of this phenomenon and effectively solve some of the specific problems that cause it. Two letters on this issue are published below.

(I)

Comrade Editor: In early December 1952, when we went to work in Jingsheng Town, Third District, Lingshi, Shanxi, local people reported to us that Guo Cuilan, a female teacher at the village's Second Elementary School, often asked students at the school to cook, wash clothes, and do other chores for her, which affected the students' studies and health. One thirteen-year-old girl at the school named Yuan Lingling often washed clothes for Guo Cuilan. On December 1st, it had just snowed heavily, and the weather was very cold. The teacher, Guo Cuilan, showed no consideration for the students and asked Yuan Lingling to go to the river early in the morning to wash clothes for her. Yuan Lingling was too shy to refuse the teacher's request. When she returned from washing clothes, she was already shivering all over. Her parents also had strong opinions, but there was nowhere to express them. Guo Cuilan also often used the time before school ended to have students take turns cooking for her.

We believe that Comrade Guo Cuilan's frequent requests for students to do private chores for her, affecting the students' studies and health, are completely inappropriate. As far as we know, this situation is very common in our Lingshi County; of course, it will also exist in other places. Therefore, I suggest that teachers in New China respect the precious time of New China's children, ensure that they have ample time to study at school, and should cherish their health, not asking children to do personal things.

Comrade Editor: I am from Xincheng Town, Sixth District, Shulu County, Hebei Province. The teachers at our village's elementary school have elementary school students take turns cooking, pushing millstones, and grinding grain, regardless of whether the weather is windy and rainy, or whether the students are studying or resting, they must do these jobs. This not only affects the students' studies, but also the elementary school students are not old enough, and it is easy to have accidents involving bumps and burns. As far as I know, similar situations are not isolated, which deserves our special attention. I suggest that the Shulu County People's Government immediately correct this phenomenon. Hong Kezhi

### 必须纠正小学教员叫学生做饭、洗衣的错误行为

专栏：读者来信

    编者按：根据读者来信反映，农村小学教员叫小学生做饭、洗衣服等杂务工作的现象很普遍。
    必须纠正小学教员叫学生做饭、洗衣的错误行为
    发生这种现象的原因，大致有两个方面：一方面是，这些教员忘记了国家交给他的任务是培养和教育下一代，而不是不关心学生的健康和学业、任意支使小学生为他个人服务。希望这些教员从思想上进行检查并在行动上改正。另一方面是，农村小学教员的教学任务很繁重，而推碾、做饭等工作完全由自己担负也的确有困难。因此，各地教育行政机关对这个实际问题应该考虑解决的办法。应该指出：教员的任务在于培养和教育下一代，学生的任务在于搞好学习。任何违反这个原则的现象都是不能允许的。建议各县教育科对这种现象作一次检查，并切实解决发生这种现象的一些具体问题。现在发表有关这一问题的两封来信在下面。
    （一）
    编辑同志：一九五二年十二月初旬，我们到山西灵石三区静升镇工作时，当地群众向我们反映：他村第二小学女教员郭翠兰经常叫该校学生替她做饭、洗衣服及做其他杂务工作，使学生的学习和身体健康都受了影响。该校有一个十三岁女生叫袁令令，她常给郭翠兰洗衣服。十二月一日那天刚下了大雪，气候十分的冷，教员郭翠兰一点不体贴学生，大清早又叫袁令令到河里去替她洗衣服。袁令令不好拒绝老师的要求，当她洗衣回来，已经冻得浑身发抖了。她家长也很有意见，但无处可提。郭翠兰还经常利用放学以前的时间，让学生轮流替她做饭。
    我们认为郭翠兰同志经常叫学生替他做私人杂务工作，影响学生的学习和身体健康是完全不应该的。据我们所知，在我们灵石县，这种情况很多；其他地方当然也会有。因此我建议新中国的教师同志们要尊重新中国儿童的宝贵的光阴，保证他们在校能有充分时间的学习，并且应该爱护他们的身体健康，不叫儿童做个人的事。

    编辑同志：我是河北省束鹿县六区新城镇人。我们村的小学校教员们让小学生轮班做饭、推碾子、推磨，不管天气是刮风下雨、学生们在学习或休息，都必须得做这些活。这不但影响了学生们的学习，而且小学生的年纪都不大，很容易发生撞伤和烫伤的危险。据我了解，类此情况不是个别的，这就值得我们特别注意了。我建议束鹿县人民政府即速纠正这种现象。洪可之
