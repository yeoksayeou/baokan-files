The Civil Architecture Design Company of the Northeast Industrial Department Promotes New Design Standards, Saving 200 Billion in Basic Construction Investment

The Civil Architecture Design Company of the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department has actively promoted the "Provisional Standards for Structural Design of Buildings," saving over 200 billion yuan in basic construction investment for the country in the past year.

The "Provisional Standards for Structural Design of Buildings" were formulated based on advanced Soviet technical specifications combined with the actual conditions in Northeast China. Its characteristics are: Under the condition of ensuring project safety, reasonably reduce the design safety factor to give full play to the effectiveness of materials and save a large amount of investment for the country. After all the design projects of the Northeast Industrial Department Civil Architecture Design Company in 1952 were designed according to this new design standard, the investment in civil construction generally decreased by about 10% without affecting the use efficiency of the buildings. The money to build one hundred factory buildings in the past can now build one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty factory buildings according to the new design standards. For example, the Industrial Department Administrative Office's children's school was originally designed according to the old standards. Later, the original design was modified according to the new standards, resulting in a saving of approximately 600 million yuan in construction costs. Another example is the dormitory built with adobe in 1951, which cost more than 800,000 yuan per square meter. However, the three-story brick staff dormitory designed in 1952 according to the new design standards, with heating, water supply, and sanitary equipment, cost only over 800,000 yuan per square meter. For example, in the design of reinforced concrete columns, steel bars can be saved by 60% and cement by 30% compared with the old standards; in the design of floor slabs, steel bars can be saved by 10% and cement by 30%.

The implementation of the new design standards has also made design technicians realize the superiority of advanced Soviet technology, thereby prompting them to break conservative thinking and further study advanced Soviet experience. At the beginning of the implementation of the new design standards, some design technicians were afraid that the new design standards were "not safe." Some said: "The new design standards are advanced Soviet experience. Their materials are good, and the construction quality is also good. We are not capable of that yet." Others said: "Let's reduce the safety factor of the old standards a bit and save a little to see how it goes, and then talk about it later!" In light of this situation, the company's leadership first repeatedly carried out ideological mobilization for all design technicians, so that they realized the great significance of promoting new design standards for national economic construction. Then, they established a new design standard study class to make them theoretically aware of the scientific basis of the new design standards. The company also exposed the serious waste caused to the country in the past due to the use of old design standards through a major quality inspection. For example, some columns originally used five steel bars, and the safety factor was very large, but the old design standards required a few more. The waste in this aspect of a certain project alone amounted to several hundred million yuan. These specific examples educated the design personnel, making them realize that they should overcome conservative thinking and earnestly promote new design standards. In addition, the company also organized design personnel to visit the Harbin Flax Factory designed by Soviet experts according to the new design standards, which further enhanced the confidence of the company's design personnel in adopting the new design standards and eliminated their ideological obstacles, making the new design standards promoted more smoothly.

According to the company's experience, the following two issues must be paid attention to when promoting new design standards: First, it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of blindly copying. The new design standards are the product of the combination of Soviet experience and China's actual conditions, and must not be blindly copied. For example, the new design standards stipulate that the allowable bearing capacity value of the foundation must be determined based on scientific geological surveys and soil analysis data, and the geological soil conditions and changes must be considered. In the foundation design of a certain factory, when conducting the foundation survey and soil analysis, they did not consider that there was a soft soil layer below, so they put forward the foundation bearing capacity value, and the design personnel did not study it well and made the design, resulting in a great loss to the country. Second, it is necessary to ensure that no errors occur in the calculation. The new design standards are scientific and advanced. They reasonably reduce the safety factor under the condition of ensuring the safety of buildings. If errors occur in the calculation during promotion, it will inevitably cause serious losses to the country. Therefore, it is necessary to fully collect original data in accordance with the requirements of the new design standards, carefully and conscientiously carry out calculations, and strengthen review to ensure that no errors occur, in order to achieve economic and practical results.

    东北工业部土木建筑设计公司
    推行新设计标准节约基本建设投资两千亿
    东北人民政府工业部土木建筑设计公司积极推行“建筑物结构设计暂行标准”，一年来为国家节省了两千多亿元的基本建设投资。
    “建筑物结构设计暂行标准”是按照苏联先进技术规范结合东北实际情况制定的。它的特点是：在保证工程安全的条件下，合理地降低设计安全系数，以充分发挥材料的效能，给国家节省大量投资。东北工业部土木建筑设计公司一九五二年所有的设计工程按照这一新的设计标准设计以后，在不影响建筑物使用效能的条件下，土木建筑投资一般都降低了百分之十左右。过去盖一百个厂房的钱，按新的设计标准，现在可以盖一百一十个到一百二十个厂房。例如工业部行政处子弟学校，原来是按照旧标准设计的，后来按照新标准修改了原来的设计，结果节省了六亿元左右的造价。再如一九五一年设计的土坯造的宿舍，每平方公尺较高的造价是八十多万元；但一九五二年按新设计标准设计的三层楼砖造职工宿舍，有暖气、水道和卫生设备，每平方公尺造价也不过八十多万元。又如在钢筋混凝土柱子设计上，钢筋可比旧标准节省百分之六十，水泥可节省百分之三十；在楼板设计上，钢筋可省百分之十，水泥可省百分之三十。
    实行新设计标准也使设计技术人员认识了苏联先进技术的优越性，从而促使他们打破保守思想，进一步学习苏联先进经验。在开始推行新设计标准时，曾有一部分设计技术人员怕新设计标准“不保险”，有的说：“新设计标准是苏联的先进经验，人家材料好，施工质量也好，我们还不行。”也有的说：“把旧标准安全系数降低一些，先节省点看看，以后再说吧！”根据这种情况，该公司领导方面就首先向全体设计技术人员反复进行思想动员，使他们认识到推行新设计标准对国家经济建设的重大意义；然后又成立了新设计标准学习班，使他们在理论上认识到新设计标准的科学根据。该公司还通过质量大检查，揭发了过去由于采用旧设计标准，给国家造成的严重浪费现象。例如有的柱子本来用五根钢筋，安全系数就很大了，但旧的设计标准却要多加几根。某工程只在这方面的浪费就达几亿元之多。这些具体事例，教育了设计人员，使他们认识到应该克服保守思想，要认真推行新设计标准。另外，该公司还组织设计人员参观苏联专家按新设计标准设计的哈尔滨亚麻厂，这就更增强了该公司设计人员采用新设计标准的信心，消除了他们的思想障碍，使新设计标准比较顺利地得到推行。
    根据该公司的经验，推行新设计标准时必须注意以下两个问题：第一、必须防止盲目硬搬的现象。新设计标准是苏联的经验和中国实际情况相结合的产物，决不能盲目硬搬。如新设计标准规定地基许可耐压力数值必须根据科学的地质勘察和土壤分析资料确定，必须考虑地质土层情况和变化情形。某厂地基设计，在作地基勘察和土壤分析时，没有考虑下面是软土层，就提出了地基耐压力数值，设计人员也没有很好研究就作了设计，结果给国家造成了很大损失。第二、必须保证在计算中不出错误。新设计标准是科学的、先进的，是在保证建筑物的安全条件下，合理地降低安全系数，推行时如计算错误，必将给国家造成严重损失。所以必须按新设计标准所规定的要求充分搜集原始资料，细致认真地进行计算，并加强审查，保证不出错误，才能做到经济合用。
