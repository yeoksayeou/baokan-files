Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th: While refusing to resume armistice negotiations and plotting military adventures, the US side has taken another big step forward in blatantly violating the agreements on the conference area and neutral zone. On January 2nd, the new US chief liaison officer, Carrol, sent a letter to our side, rudely refusing to bear responsibility for the US aircraft intrusion into the conference area on December 26, 1952. He even absurdly claimed: "As long as there are no hostile acts in these areas, such overflights do not violate the spirit of existing understandings between liaison officers."

Observers here point out that the agreement clearly stipulates that military aircraft of both sides must not fly over the conference area and the neutral zone. This blatant provocative act by the US side, in brazenly overturning the agreement, is obviously aimed at finally tearing up the various agreements serving as the basis for negotiations, and pushing the armistice negotiations to a final rupture. Carrol's attempt to escape the responsibility for the US side's frequent dispatch of aircraft to violate the agreement by using the excuse that "climatic and technical conditions cannot be controlled" is utterly ridiculous. As everyone knows, each time a US aircraft intruded into the conference area, it occurred during clear daylight, and each time there were eyewitnesses who saw the US aircraft violating the agreement. This violation of the agreement has absolutely nothing to do with climate or technical conditions. In fact, the US aircraft, taking advantage of our side's strict adherence to the spirit of the agreement, constantly and intentionally intruded over the conference area, carrying out provocations in order to bomb and strafe our positions surrounding this area. Therefore, in reality, every violation of the agreement by US aircraft is a hostile act.

The whole world knows clearly that since the armistice negotiations began eighteen months ago, the US side has used every means to wantonly violate the agreements on the conference area and the neutral zone. Since the US side unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations on October 8, 1952, US aircraft have intruded into the conference area eleven times, and have constantly intruded over the Kaesong neutral zone. US aircraft also wantonly bombed the clearly marked vehicles of our delegation traveling from Kaesong to Pyongyang, injuring five of our personnel. The US side has not yet made a responsible explanation to our side. In addition, the US side shelled the conference area three times, dropped insulting leaflets in the conference area many times, and has become increasingly blatant in using the conference area as a channel for special agent activities, dispatching plainclothes agents to sneak into the conference area to kidnap and coerce residents. These shameful acts of the US side are all recorded and cannot be denied. The US side should bear serious responsibility for its provocative acts of wantonly violating the agreement in an attempt to bring the armistice negotiations to a complete rupture.

    美方蛮横拒绝承当破坏会场区协议的责任
    阴谋撕毁作为谈判基础的各种协议把谈判推向最后破裂
    【新华社开城五日电】美方在拒绝恢复停战谈判、策划军事冒险的同时，在明目张胆地破坏会场区、中立区协议方面，竟又向前跨了一大步。一月二日，新任美方谈判首席联络官卡洛克致函我方，竟蛮横地拒绝承担一九五二年十二月二十六日美机侵越会场区事件的责任，益悖谬地声称：“只要在这些地区内不进行敌对行为，这种飞越并不违反联络官之间现存的谅解的精神。”
    此间观察家指出：双方协议明白规定双方军用飞机不得飞越会场区和中立区。美方这种悍然推翻协议的公开挑衅行为，显然是为了最后撕毁作为谈判基础的各种协议，把停战谈判推向最后破裂。卡洛克企图以“气候条件和技术条件无法控制”的借口，来逃脱美方派遣飞机频繁地破坏协议的责任，是十分可笑的。大家知道，美机每次侵越会场区，都发生在天气晴朗的白天，而且每次都有亲眼看见美机破坏协议行为的人证，这种破坏协议的行为根本与气候和技术条件无关。事实上，美机利用我方严格遵守协议的精神，不断有意地侵越会场区上空，进行挑衅以便对这个地区周围的我方阵地进行轰炸扫射。因此，实际上美机每一次破坏协议事件都是敌对行动。
    全世界清楚地知道：停战谈判举行十八个月以来，美方用尽手段肆无忌惮地破坏会场区、中立区协议。仅自一九五二年十月八日美方有计划地中断停战谈判以来，美机曾侵越会场区十一次，并不断地侵越开城中立区上空。美机并滥肆轰炸自开城去平壤的置有明显标志的我方代表团车辆，打伤我方人员五名，美方至今还未向我方作负责交代。此外，美方炮击会场区三次，在会场区内投发侮辱性传单多次，并愈来愈明目张胆地把会场区作为特务活动的往来通道，派遣便衣特务潜入会场区内绑架和胁迫居民。美方的这种种可耻行径都记录在案，不容抵赖。美方对其肆意破坏协议以图使停战谈判陷于完全破裂的挑衅行为，应负严重的责任。
