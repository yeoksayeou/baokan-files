    Reporting Good News to the Heroic Husband
    ——A Letter from Model Military Family Member Tian Lanhua of Guazigou Village, Suburbs of Taiyuan City, to Volunteer Soldier Yan Junfan

    Dear Comrade Junfan:

    I received the letter you sent on January 3rd. You asked about the production and living conditions at home, and now I will tell you everything from beginning to end. First, I want to report some good news to you: I have been elected as a labor model and a model military family member!

    Last February, I went to the district to participate in a Party rectification training class for more than a month. This time, I finally understood the direction of social development and the glory of labor. I criticized my own thinking of relying on men for life. After returning to the village, I told the women in our village what I had learned. Sixteen of us women formed a mutual aid team, and I was elected as the leader. Before spring began, we first engaged in sideline production, quarrying a total of fifty-three cubic meters of gravel in the riverbed below our village, earning 1.92 million RMB. This gave us even greater motivation. After the spring plowing began, because our farming skills were still lacking, we merged with the Ma Lan mutual aid team (their team had more men). We worked alongside the men, breaking up clods and transporting manure with donkeys, doing no less than the men. I learned how to soak seeds, mix seeds, hoe, and loosen the soil. The women in our team also raised 250 chickens and 15 pigs. Now our mutual aid team is preparing to transform into an agricultural production cooperative.

    At the military family member symposium in our village last January, the preferential treatment committee member said to our father, "Let's cultivate a few acres of land for you this year!" Before father could speak, I interjected, "This year, our family's land doesn't need to be cultivated by anyone else, I will cultivate it myself." Later, the villagers felt bad and wanted to subsidize us with some millet. I refused no matter what, but they insisted and left more than 100 jin of millet. I planted all twenty-four mu of land that we had been allocated during the land reform. Although our village experienced some drought last year, our drought prevention and resistance movement overcame the disaster. We also applied more manure and added more labor, so the seedlings not only didn't suffer from the drought, but we also achieved an overall bumper harvest. In 1951, we harvested a total of 1,760 jin of grain; last year, we harvested 2,795 jin, an increase of 63 percent. With more grain harvested, our family's living standards have also improved. Father said that I had worked hard and sewed me a uniform.

    Last summer, the national patriotic health campaign was launched, and I was the first to respond actively. Because I knew that you were directly threatened by bacteriological weapons in Korea, I hated it immensely. I went door-to-door to publicize to the masses, explaining that paying attention to hygiene was a practical action to combat the American bacteriological warfare. Every family in our village established a patriotic health plan, and the streets and alleys were divided into sections for "contracted responsibility" according to where they lived, cleaning them once every other day. Every household had hygiene facilities. The hygiene work was also checked during each patriotic inspection day. The hygiene work in our village was maintained regularly, and therefore it was rated as a model patriotic health village in Taiyuan City.

    Last year, our village started an experimental literacy class, and I signed up to participate. Everyone elected me as the group leader. I have never been late and rarely taken leave. I have already recognized more than a thousand characters and can understand simple news in the newspaper. I can also recognize almost all of the letters you write back.

    I deeply feel that being a family member of a volunteer soldier is very glorious, and I receive love and respect from people everywhere. On our street door, there is a "Glorious Military Family" plaque hung by the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government. When the village entertains with operas, not only are we called to sit in the front, but the cadres also warmly entertain us, pouring water and offering cigarettes. During the New Year and festivals, every household automatically sends some gifts to the military families, which has become a habit. During the New Year, everyone sent good cigarettes to our father. Father said, "I've lived to be so old, and I've never smoked such good cigarettes."

    Last November, I was honorably elected as a labor model representative and attended the district-wide labor model conference. In December, I was honorably elected as a first-class model military family member in Taiyuan City and attended the district and city preferential treatment model conference. The responsible comrades in the city all kindly asked me about my well-being and gave me prizes such as woolen clothes and foreign cloth. At the meeting, everyone said that we were "a good woman matched with a good man, a hero matched with a model."

    As I write this letter, I see the news that your volunteer army annihilated more than 14,000 enemies in December 1952. I am truly moved. You can achieve such great victories in the winter at minus 20 or 30 degrees Celsius. I must learn from your spirit and work and study harder. I hope that the news of victory will continue to come, and that the good news of your meritorious service will be hung on our wall soon. I wish you good health!

                        Your loving wife, Tian Lanhua
                            January 20th

    向英雄的丈夫报喜
    ——太原市郊区瓜地沟村模范军属田兰花给志愿军阎俊范的信亲爱的俊范同志：
    元月三日寄来的信，我收到了。你问咱家的生产、生活情形，现在从头到尾地告诉你。我先向你报个喜，我当选了劳动模范和模范军属啦！
    去年二月份，我到区上参加整党训练班学习了一个多月。这回我才知道了社会发展的方向和劳动的光荣。我批判了我自己依靠男人生活的思想。回了村以后，我就把所学到的东西告诉给咱村的妇女。我们十六个妇女组成了一个互助组，我被选当了组长。在没有开春的时候，我们先作副业生产，到咱村下边的河槽里共打了五十三方石子，挣下人民币一百九十二万元。这一下我们的劲头更大了。春耕开始后，因为我们种地的技术还差，所以就和马兰互助组合并了（他们组的男人多）。我们和男人们一块动弹，挞茬子、打土块，赶上毛驴送粪，都不比男人们少做。浸种、拌种、锄地、镂地，我都学会了。我们这个组的妇女还养了二百五十只鸡、十五口猪。现在我们的互助组正在准备转为农业生产合作社。
    在去年正月咱村的军属座谈会上，优抚委员向咱爹说：“今年给你代耕上几亩地吧！”未经爹开口，我就接着说：“今年我家的地不用代耕了，我自己种吧。”后来村里的群众过意不去，要给咱补助些小米。我高低不要，他们不肯，结果留下了一百多斤米。我把咱在土地改革中分下的那二十四亩地都种上了。去年咱村虽然有些天旱，但是我们的防旱抗旱运动战胜了旱灾。我们又多上了粪土，多加了工，苗子不但没有旱坏，而且得了个全面丰产。一九五一年咱共打下粮食一千七百六十斤；去年打了二千七百九十五斤，多了百分之六十三。打的粮食多了。咱家的生活也提高了。爹说我辛苦啦，给我缝了一身制服。
    去年夏天，全国开展了爱国卫生运动，我首先积极响应。因为我知道，你在朝鲜直接受到了细菌武器的威胁，所以我万分地痛恨它。我挨门逐户地向群众做宣传，说明讲卫生就是打击美国细菌战的实际行动。咱村家家订立了爱国卫生计划，大街小巷都按住的地方分片实行“包干”，每隔一天扫除一次。家里都有了卫生设备。每次过爱国检查日时，也检查卫生工作。咱村的卫生工作保持了经常，因此被评为全太原市的爱国卫生模范村。
    去年咱村开办了速成识字实验班，我报名参加了。大家把我选为小组长。我从来也没迟到，也很少请过假。我已经认熟了一千多个生字，能看懂报上的简单消息了。你写回来的信，也差不多能认下来了。
    我深深感到当一个志愿军的家属是非常光荣的，到处受到人们的爱护和尊敬。在咱的街门上边，有太原市人民政府给咱挂的“光荣军属”的牌牌。在村里娱乐唱戏的时候，不但叫咱坐在前边，干部们还热情地招待，给倒水、拿烟。逢到过年过节，每家都自动地给军属们送些礼物，这已经成了习惯。过新年时，大伙给咱爹送来好纸烟。爹说：“我活到这么老，也没吃过这样好的烟。”
    去年十一月，我光荣地被选为劳动模范代表，出席了全区的劳动模范大会。十二月，我又光荣地被选为全太原市的甲等模范军属，出席了区、市优抚模范大会。市里的负责同志都亲切地向我问长问短，并给了绒衣、洋布等奖品。在会上，大家都说咱是“好女配好男，英雄配模范”。
    当我写这封信的时候，我又看到了你们志愿军在一九五二年十二月歼敌一万四千多人的胜利消息。我实在感动。你们在零下二、三十度的冬天，能取得这样大的胜利，我一定要学习你们的精神，更加努力工作，努力学习。我希望胜利的消息不断地传来，你立功的喜报早日挂在咱的墙上。祝你身体健康！
                        你的爱人　田兰花
                            一月二十日
