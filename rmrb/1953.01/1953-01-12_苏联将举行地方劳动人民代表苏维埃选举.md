Xinhua News Agency, January 10th, Moscow: The biennial elections for local Soviets in the Soviet Union are approaching. The Presidiums of the Supreme Soviets of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Estonia, and Karelo-Finnish Republics have recently issued orders regarding this matter. According to these orders, elections for the local Soviets of Working People's Deputies in the border regions, provinces, autonomous regions, districts, towns, and villages of each republic will be held on February 23rd or March 1st.

Currently, election preparations are actively underway. Working people are gathering to elect outstanding Stakhanovite workers, harvest experts, Party, Soviet, and economic workers, scientists, and cultural workers as members of the election committees. The Soviets of Working People's Deputies at all levels have begun meticulously compiling voter lists to ensure that every Soviet citizen can exercise the right to vote as stipulated by the Soviet Constitution.

According to Soviet election law and regulations, a polling district is generally established for every 1,500 to 3,000 people. In areas dominated by small villages, a polling district can be established in areas with 50 or more people. In this election, due to the increase in population, many regions have added new polling districts compared to the last election. For example, Moscow has added 48 polling districts, Leningrad has added 12 polling districts, and Stalingrad has added 32 polling districts. The mass character of this election is extremely significant. In Moscow alone, more than 7,000 representatives will be elected to the City Soviet and the district Soviets, and approximately 70,000 people will participate in the election committees.

The editorial published by the Moscow "Izvestia" on December 16, 1952, specifically for this election, pointed out: The elections for the local Soviets of Working People's Deputies are a major political event in the lives of the Soviet people. The upcoming elections will have great significance for the further consolidation of the Soviet system and the development of socialist democracy, as well as for the improvement of all work of the state power organs in various localities.

    苏联将举行地方劳动人民代表苏维埃选举
    【新华社十日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联两年一度的地方苏维埃选举即将举行。俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克、哈萨克、立陶宛、摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克、亚美尼亚、土库曼、爱沙尼亚、卡累利阿—芬兰等加盟共和国的最高苏维埃主席团最近已分别就此事发布命令。按照这些命令，各共和国的边疆区、州、专区、区、市镇、乡村等将在二月二十三日或三月一日举行地方劳动人民代表苏维埃的选举。 目前，选举筹备工作正在积极进行。劳动人民纷纷集会，把优秀的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者，丰收能手，党的、苏维埃的和经济方面的工作者，科学工作者和文艺工作者选作选举委员会的委员。各级劳动人民代表苏维埃已着手缜密地编制选民名单，以使每一个苏维埃公民都能行使苏联宪法所规定的选举权。
    根据苏联选举法和选举条例，一般地区每有一千五百人到三千人就成立一个选区，在小村落占优势的地方，五十人以上的地区即可成立一个选区。在这次选举中，由于居民的增加，许多地区比上次选举时增设了新选举区，例如，莫斯科增设了四十八个选区，列宁格勒增设了十二个选区，斯大林格勒增设了三十二个选区。这次选举的群众性极为显著。单就莫斯科市来说，被选入市苏维埃和各区苏维埃的代表就将有七千余人，参加选举委员会的将有七万人左右。
    一九五二年十二月十六日莫斯科“消息报”特为这次选举发表的社论指出：地方劳动人民代表苏维埃的选举，是苏联人民生活中的重大政治事件。即将举行的选举对苏维埃制度的进一步巩固和社会主义民主的发展，对各地国家权力机关全部工作的改善，将有巨大的意义。
