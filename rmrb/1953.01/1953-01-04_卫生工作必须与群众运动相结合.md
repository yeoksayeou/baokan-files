    The Second National Health Conference, recently held in Beijing, summarized the achievements and experiences of the patriotic health campaign over the past year. Based on the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, it put forward the principles and tasks for continuing the patriotic health campaign in 1953. This is of great significance in accelerating the development of China's public health. At the same time, as American imperialism continues to expand its war of aggression against Korea and continues to wage bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, the Second National Health Conference, in proposing the tasks for continuing the patriotic health campaign in 1953, particularly emphasized the need to continue strengthening all measures against bacteriological warfare. This is also a very important decision for strengthening the resistance against American aggression and aiding Korea and consolidating China's security.
    Through the patriotic health campaign of 1952, we have gained a lot of experience in promoting health work, such as experience in organizing inspections, experience in publicity and education, and experience in combining health work with production and other current central tasks. The most fundamental experience is that health work must be integrated with mass movements.
    The patriotic health campaign has been going on for just over a year, and the health conditions across the country have already improved significantly. Diseases have been significantly reduced, and the appearance of many cities and villages has been completely renewed. Some cities have even seen the miracle of being fly-free in the summer. This is the result of our mobilizing the broad masses to promote health work. Clearly, if we did not mobilize the broad masses, such a degree of improvement could not have been achieved in such a short period of one year. This means that carrying out mass health campaigns is not only a reliable guarantee for crushing the enemy's bacteriological warfare, but also a shortcut to improving China's health conditions.
    The First National Health Conference put forward three principles for health work: "Serve the workers, peasants and soldiers," "Prevention first," and "Unite Chinese and Western medicine." The achievements of China's health work over the past three years have proven that these three principles are correct. However, while these three principles have pointed out the position that health workers should take, the focus that health work should have, and the forces that the health department should unite, they have not yet explained the methods that should be adopted to comprehensively promote health work. The experience of the patriotic health campaign tells us that integrating health work with mass movements is the most effective way to promote health work and the only correct line for implementing the principles of "Serve the workers, peasants and soldiers," "Prevention first," and "Unite Chinese and Western medicine." The Second National Health Conference, based on Premier Zhou's instructions, decided to add the principle of "Integrating health work with mass movements" in addition to the three principles of health work, which is one of the most important gains of this conference.
    The principle of "Serve the workers, peasants and soldiers" stipulates that our health science and technology should serve the broadest masses of the people in China, which is the fundamental difference between health work and that of the old society. However, in order to achieve the goal of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers well, it is not enough to simply take the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the object of work. It is also necessary to carry out health work through the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves. The power and wisdom of the masses are infinite. In 1952, more than 160 million tons of garbage and feces were removed nationwide, more than 40 million cubic meters of sewage pits were filled, more than 33,000 kilometers of sewers were built, more than 280,000 kilometers of ditches were dredged, more than 1.3 million new and improved water wells were built, more than 120 million rats were caught, and countless flies and mosquitoes were exterminated. In carrying out these tasks, the masses not only created many effective technical experiences in health work, but also created many effective organizational experiences in health work. Such amazing achievements and rich creations can only emerge in the midst of broad mass movements. If we do not widely mobilize the masses and do not earnestly learn from the masses, health work cannot be done well. If we do not popularize health science among the masses through mass movements, health science cannot be improved on the basis of popularization.
    The principle of "Prevention first" is aimed at the purely treatment-oriented view that is contrary to the interests of the broad masses. Only by starting with prevention, reducing diseases, and enhancing the people's physique, can we fundamentally improve the people's health level. The main problem in doing a good job in prevention is to improve environmental hygiene and personal hygiene, and to eliminate old living habits that do not conform to hygiene principles. This must of course be achieved through mass movements and on the basis of mass consciousness. For example, Taixing Village in Yanji County, Jilin Province, achieved separation of people and cattle through the patriotic health campaign. Yangtang Township in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, through the patriotic health campaign, reduced diseases in 1952 to 78.5% of the same period in 1951. Yuyu Village in the Miao Autonomous Region of Damiaoshan, Guangxi Province, after the patriotic health campaign, residents understood how to cut bamboo heads to prevent malaria. Shang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, established public toilets and public livestock pens through the patriotic health campaign. Many other places have broken old superstitious habits through the patriotic health campaign, such as burying tens of thousands of floating coffins in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. These are typical examples of mobilizing the masses to achieve the effect of changing customs and habits. It can be seen that only by carrying out mass health campaigns, constantly improving the level of scientific health knowledge of the broad masses, and establishing regular mass health activities can we implement the principle of "Prevention first."
    Although "Unite Chinese and Western medicine" is only a matter for the health department and health workers themselves, this requirement must also be constantly supervised by the masses and assessed by the masses in order to be well implemented. In the patriotic health campaign, Western medicine has further approached the broad masses, and traditional Chinese medicine has widely participated in health and epidemic prevention work. The patriotic health campaign not only made both Chinese and Western medicine feel that they are indispensable forces to each other, strengthened their unity, and also played a great role in promoting the popularization of Western medicine and the scientificization of traditional Chinese medicine.
    From the perspective of the state's construction requirements for health work, it is also necessary to emphasize the integration of health work with mass movements. China's large-scale economic construction is beginning, and to ensure the smooth progress of construction, we need a strong labor force and qualified industrial and mining health and safety facilities. Strengthening health work is a major event related to national construction and is an arduous task. The completion of such a task cannot be undertaken solely by the health authorities. The health authorities must be closely linked with all relevant parties, cooperate with each other, and carry out mass health campaigns to mobilize the masses to do it in order to achieve good results.
    The experience of the 1952 patriotic health campaign tells us that under the active leadership of the central and local Party organizations and the people's governments, with the health departments as the backbone and close cooperation with all relevant departments and mass organizations, is the prerequisite for mobilizing the masses to carry out the patriotic health campaign. For example, to carry out the health campaign in industrial and mining areas, the health departments, industrial and mining enterprise departments, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League must be closely linked and cooperate. In the past, this kind of connection and cooperation was not enough, and it must be strengthened in the future, especially by strengthening this kind of connection and cooperation between the leading organs of these departments first. To carry out the health campaign among urban and rural residents, the health departments, public security departments, women's federations, and the Communist Youth League must be closely linked and cooperate. This kind of connection and cooperation must also be strengthened in the future. Furthermore, in order to promote the prevention and control of parasitic diseases, close ties must be established between the health department, the agricultural department, and the water conservancy department. In order to carry out universal and in-depth health publicity and education among the masses, close ties must be established between the health department and the propaganda department and the cultural and artistic departments. In short, carrying out the patriotic health campaign is a common task of all local Party, government, military, and civilian organs and organizations, and the health authorities and health workers must assume the responsibility of regular organization and promotion and play the backbone role they should play.
    Here, we must criticize two incorrect practices. One incorrect practice often exists among some health cadres: they do not contact all relevant parties, do not handle affairs according to the specific conditions of the masses, do not earnestly work among the masses, do not patiently study what are the most urgent problems to be solved in health at that time and place, and what are the practical and feasible ways to solve the problems, etc., and imagine that as long as some health laws and regulations are stipulated, mass health work can be done well. Obviously, this is a subjective approach that departs from the masses and cannot truly solve the problems. Health workers must study hard and learn the skills to lead and carry out mass health campaigns. Another incorrect practice exists among the administrative heads of some units: they only see on the surface the contradiction in time allocation between carrying out the health campaign and completing production tasks or other central tasks, and do not consider how to solve this contradiction from the relationship between improving production and paying attention to health. Or they think that health work is only a matter for health workers, and there is no need to carry out mass health campaigns. This is also wrong. This is one of the reasons why the 1952 patriotic health campaign was not well carried out in some units, especially in some industrial and mining enterprises. They should also study and learn the skills to support the health authorities and health workers and to integrate mass health campaigns with production.
    Carrying out mass health campaigns is by no means a temporary measure. We not only have the task of continuing to crush the enemy's bacteriological warfare, but also have the task of continuing to accelerate the development of China's public health. Carrying out the patriotic health campaign is a serious task of fighting the enemy and also an important social reform. We must, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, continue to work hard without slackening, resolutely carry out this campaign more universally and deeply in 1953, and strive for new and greater victories.

### 卫生工作必须与群众运动相结合

    卫生工作必须与群众运动相结合
    最近在北京召开的第二届全国卫生会议总结了一年来爱国卫生运动的成绩和经验，并且根据中央人民政府政务院的决定，提出了一九五三年继续开展爱国卫生运动的方针和任务。这在加速我国人民卫生事业的发展上是有重大意义的。同时，由于美国帝国主义还在继续扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，继续在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战，第二届全国卫生会议在提出一九五三年继续开展爱国卫生运动的任务时，特别强调指出要继续加强反细菌战的一切措施。这对于加强抗美援朝和巩固我国安全，也是一个非常重要的决定。
    经过一九五二年的爱国卫生运动，我们在推行卫生工作方面获得了很多经验，如关于组织检查的经验，关于宣传教育的经验，关于卫生工作与生产及其他当前中心任务结合的经验等等，而最根本的经验是：卫生工作必须与群众运动相结合。
    爱国卫生运动从开始到现在，为时还不过一年，全国各地卫生状况已经大大地改善了，疾病显著地减少了，许多城市和乡村的面貌已经焕然一新，有些城市出现了夏天无蝇的奇迹。这就是我们发动广大群众推行卫生工作的结果。很明显，如果我们不发动广大群众，如此程度的改进绝不是短短一年时间所能实现的。这就是说，开展群众性卫生运动不仅是粉碎敌人细菌战的可靠的保证，而且是改进我国卫生状况所应取的一条捷径。
    第一届全国卫生会议曾经提出了“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”和“团结中西医”三项卫生工作原则。三年来我国卫生工作的成绩证明这三项原则是正确的。然而，这三项原则虽然已经指出了卫生工作者所应取的立场，卫生工作所应有的重点和卫生部门所应团结的力量；但是还没有说明全面地推行卫生工作所应采取的方法。爱国卫生运动的经验告诉我们：卫生工作与群众运动相结合才是推行卫生工作的最有效的方法，才是贯彻“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”和“团结中西医”等项原则的唯一正确路线。第二届全国卫生会议根据周总理的指示，决定在三项卫生工作原则之外，增加“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”这一原则，是这次会议的一个最重要的收获。
    “面向工农兵”的原则规定我们的卫生科学技术要为我国最广大的人民服务，这是与旧社会卫生工作的根本区别所在。然而，为了很好地达到为工农兵服务的目的，仅仅把工农兵作为工作对象是不够的，还必须通过工农兵自己来进行卫生工作。群众的力量和智慧是无穷的。一九五二年全国清除垃圾粪便一亿六千余万吨，填平污水坑四千余万立方公尺，修下水道三万三千余公里，疏通沟渠二十八万余公里，新建及改良水井一百三十余万口，捕鼠一亿二千余万只，灭蝇、灭蚊无数；群众在进行这些工作时不仅创造了许多行之有效的卫生工作技术经验，而且创造了许多行之有效的卫生工作组织经验：像这些惊人的成绩和丰富的创造唯有在广大的群众运动中间才能出现。如果我们不广泛发动群众，不认真从群众中吸取经验，卫生工作就不可能做好；如果我们不将卫生科学经过群众运动在群众中普及，卫生科学也无法在普及的基础上提高。
    “预防为主”的原则是针对着与广大群众利益违背的单纯治疗观点提出的。唯有从预防着手，减少疾病，增强人民的体质，才是提高人民健康水平的根本的办法。而做好预防工作的主要问题在于改进环境卫生和个人卫生，在于革除旧有的不合卫生原则的生活习惯。这当然必须经过群众运动，在群众自觉的基础之上才能实现。像吉林延吉县太兴村经过爱国卫生运动做到了人牛分居，湖南衡山县洋塘乡经过爱国卫生运动，使一九五二年比一九五一年同一时期的疾病减少到百分之七十八点五，广西大苗山苗族自治区雨玉村经过爱国卫生运动居民懂得了砍竹头预防疟疾，陕西长安县尚村经过爱国卫生运动建立了公共厕所和公共畜圈。还有许多地方经过爱国卫生运动破除了迷信风习，如江苏、浙江地区把成万的浮厝都掩埋了。这都是发动群众收到移风易俗效果的典型例证。由此可见，只有开展群众性的卫生运动，不断地提高广大群众的科学卫生知识水平，建立群众的经常卫生活动，才能贯彻“预防为主”的原则。
    “团结中西医”虽然只是卫生部门和卫生工作者本身的问题，然而这一要求也必须经常受群众的监督，受群众的考核，才能很好地贯彻。在爱国卫生运动中，西医进一步接近了广大群众，中医广泛地参加了卫生防疫工作。爱国卫生运动不仅使中西医感觉到互相都是不可缺少的力量，加强了他们的团结，并且在西医群众化和中医科学化上，起了很大的推动作用。
    从国家建设对于卫生工作的要求来看，也必须强调卫生工作与群众运动相结合。我国大规模的经济建设工作正在开始，要保证建设的顺利进行，就需要有身体强壮的劳动大军和合格的工矿卫生安全设施。加强卫生工作是关系到国家建设的一件大事，是一个繁重的任务。完成这样的任务不是卫生机关所能单独胜任的，必须卫生机关与各有关方面密切联系，互相配合，开展群众性卫生运动发动群众来做，才能收到良好的效果。
    一九五二年爱国卫生运动的经验告诉我们：在中央及各地方党的组织和人民政府的积极领导下，以卫生部门为骨干，与各有关部门和群众团体密切配合，是发动群众开展爱国卫生运动的先决条件。譬如开展工矿区卫生运动，必须卫生部门、工矿企业部门、工会和青年团密切联系配合；过去这种联系配合是不够的，今后必须加强，特别是先在这些部门的首脑机关之间加强这种联系配合。开展城市、乡村居民的卫生运动，必须卫生部门、公安部门、妇联和青年团等等密切联系配合；今后这种联系配合也必须加强。再如，为了推行寄生虫病的防治工作，在卫生部门、农业部门、水利部门之间必须建立密切的联系；为了在群众间进行普遍深入的卫生宣传教育，在卫生部门与宣传部门、文化艺术部门之间必须建立密切联系。总之，开展爱国卫生运动是各地方党政军民机关团体共同的任务，而卫生机关和卫生工作人员则必须担负起经常的组织推动的责任，起应有的骨干作用。
    这里我们必须对两种不正确的做法进行批判。一种不正确的做法是常常在有些卫生干部中间存在的：他们不和各有关方面联系，不根据群众的具体情况办事，不认真在群众中间进行工作，不耐心研究当时当地在卫生方面最迫切需要解决的问题是什么，以及怎样才是解决问题的切实可行的办法等等，而设想只要规定一些卫生法令、条例就能把群众卫生工作做好。显然，这是光从主观愿望出发的脱离群众的作法，是不能真正解决问题的。卫生工作人员必须好好地学习，学会领导开展群众卫生运动的本领。另一种不正确的做法是在有些单位的行政负责人中间存在的：他们仅仅从表面上看到开展卫生运动与完成生产任务或其他中心任务在时间分配上的矛盾，而不从提高生产与讲求卫生之间的相依相辅关系上来考虑设法解决这一矛盾；或者认为卫生工作仅仅是卫生工作人员的事，没有开展群众性卫生运动的必要。这也是不对的。这正是一九五二年的爱国卫生运动在有些单位特别是有些工矿企业单位没有很好地开展起来的一个原因。他们也应当学习，学会支持卫生机关和卫生工作人员，使群众性卫生运动与生产相结合的本领。
    开展群众性的卫生运动绝不是一个临时的措施。我们不仅有继续粉碎敌人细菌战的任务，而且有继续加速我国人民卫生事业发展的任务。开展爱国卫生运动是一项严重的对敌斗争任务，也是一项重要的社会改革工作。我们必须根据中央人民政府政务院的指示，毫不松懈地继续努力，坚决在一九五三年更普遍更深入地开展这一运动，争取新的更大的胜利。
