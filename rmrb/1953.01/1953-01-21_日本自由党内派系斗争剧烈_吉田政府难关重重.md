Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 20th: The struggle for power and profit among factions within Japan's ruling Liberal Party is intensifying as the Japanese people's opposition to the Yoshida government's disastrous policies grows.

The contradictions and crises within the Liberal Party have been escalating daily since the post-election farce between the Yoshida and Hatoyama groups for the "premiership." The Hatoyama group is actively seeking opportunities to force the Yoshida group to concede, in order to replace it. At the end of November 1952, it seized the opportunity of the opposition parties' no-confidence motion in the Diet against Minister of International Trade and Industry Hayato Ikeda, and staged an "absence" demonstration in the Diet during the vote, demonstrating against the Yoshida group, allowing the no-confidence motion to pass. Kyodo News Agency said that Ikeda's forced resignation inflicted a "politically fatal wound" on the Yoshida cabinet. In mid-December, the Hatoyama group took advantage of the Yoshida government's submission of a supplementary budget to the Diet for approval, threatening that its so-called "Democratization League" members would again be "absent" during the Diet session, coercing the Yoshida group to make concessions. Yoshida was finally forced to agree to reinstate Ichizo Ishibashi and Ichiro Kono, important figures in the Hatoyama group who had been expelled from the party by Yoshida during the election. The Hatoyama group also demanded that Yoshida dismiss the Liberal Party Secretary-General, Joji Hayashi, and the Chairman of the General Council, Hidezugu Masutani, who were responsible for expelling these two individuals.

As the Yoshida government prepared the unpopular draft budget for the 1953 fiscal year and the House of Councillors election approached, the Hatoyama group intensified its attacks on the Yoshida group. After being reinstated, Ichizo Ishibashi stated on the 13th that he would overturn the draft budget and overthrow the Yoshida cabinet when the Diet approved the budget, and announced that "the Democratization League will not be dissolved until the Yoshida cabinet is overthrown." In order to win popular support, Ishibashi openly pointed out: "Prime Minister Yoshida, under the protection of the United States, has damaged Japan's democratic politics. He is a puppet of the United States. He engages in secret diplomacy and sacrifices Japanese industry for his own power grabs. Therefore, overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet is a prerequisite for establishing democratic politics."

The internal strife within the Liberal Party has deepened the crisis of the Yoshida government's downfall. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th stated: Although the Liberal Party still holds a majority of seats in the Diet, "Yoshida's political position has been greatly weakened because the defectors led by Ichiro Hatoyama occupy nearly fifty seats in the Diet and often threaten to abstain from voting or vote for the opposition parties." "Political observers believe that the defectors, who are deeply dissatisfied with Yoshida's control, will definitely make trouble for Yoshida when the budget for the 1953 fiscal year is submitted to the Diet for approval, and even force him to step down together with the opposition parties." The passage of the budget draft and the House of Councillors election will be two major challenges for the Yoshida government. Agence France-Presse said: "The question currently being discussed in Japanese political and journalistic circles is when Yoshida will resign and who will succeed him."

### 日本自由党内派系斗争剧烈  吉田政府难关重重

    日本自由党内派系斗争剧烈
    吉田政府难关重重
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：日本执政党自由党内部派系争权夺利的斗争，正随着日本人民对吉田政府祸国殃民的政策的日益增长的反对而愈来愈剧烈。
    自由党的吉田集团和鸠山集团之间在大选以后演出了一场争夺“组阁首长”的丑剧之后，自由党内部的矛盾和危机一天天严重起来。鸠山集团积极伺机迫使吉田集团退让，以便取而代之。它在一九五二年十一月底抓住反对党在国会对通商产业相池田勇人提出不信任案的机会，在国会进行表决时，来了一个对吉田集团示威的“缺席”表演，使不信任案得以通过。共同社说，池田的被迫去职使吉田内阁受到“政治上的致命伤”。十二月中旬，鸠山集团又趁吉田政府将补充预算提交国会批准的机会，扬言它所属的所谓“民主化同盟”议员将在国会开会时再次“缺席”，要挟吉田集团让步。吉田终于被迫同意恢复在大选时被吉田开除出党的鸠山集团重要人物石桥湛山和河野一郎的党籍。鸠山集团并要求吉田把负责开除这两个人的自由党干事长林让治和总务会长益谷秀次解职。
    随着吉田政府编制不得人心的一九五三会计年度预算草案和参议院选举的临近，鸠山集团加紧了对吉田集团的攻击。石桥湛山在恢复党籍之后，十三日表示要在国会批准预算草案时推翻这个预算草案和搞垮吉田内阁，并宣布“不打倒吉田内阁，民主化同盟是不解散的”。石桥湛山为了笼络人心，公开指出：“首相吉田在美国的庇护之下，损害了日本的民主政治。他是美国的傀儡。他进行秘密外交，牺牲日本产业，以便于他的争权夺利。所以打倒吉田内阁是建立民主政治的前提条件。”
    自由党内部的纷争，加深了吉田政府的倒台危机。法新社东京十一日电说：虽然自由党在国会中仍然占有多数议席，“可是由于鸠山一郎所领导的背叛分子在国会中占的议席近五十席，并且经常以放弃投票或投反对党的票相威胁，吉田的政治地位就大大削弱了。”“政治观察家相信，对于吉田的把持深感不满的背叛分子，在一九五三会计年度的预算提交国会通过的时候，一定会给吉田捣蛋，甚至和反对党在一起逼他下台。”国会通过预算草案和参议院选举将是吉田政府的两大难关。法新社说：“目前日本政界和报界纷纷讨论的问题是吉田的辞职会在什么时候，接替他的是那一个。”
