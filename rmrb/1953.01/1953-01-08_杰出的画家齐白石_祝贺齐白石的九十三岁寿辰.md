The outstanding painter Qi Baishi
——Congratulating Qi Baishi on his Ninety-Third Birthday
Wang Chaowen

We, the art workers of China, are pleased and proud to congratulate the people's painter, Mr. Qi Baishi, on his ninety-third birthday. Because his mental labor prominently demonstrates the artistic talent of the Chinese people, because his creative mental labor enriches the spiritual life of the people, because his outstanding achievements in art serve as a demonstration for art workers.

Qi Baishi is not only an outstanding old painter, but also a painter, seal engraver, and poet with special talents. He was born into a farming family in Xiangtan, Hunan. He loved painting from an early age and began painting at the age of seven. However, like many children in poor families, his interests and desires were difficult to develop and satisfy. He only studied for half a year, and before the age of twenty-seven, he worked as a shepherd and a carpenter for fifteen years. During his time as a carpenter, although he endured hard labor during the day, he did not relax his painting practice at night, often staying up until late. Because he showed extraordinary talent in fine wood carving and painting, he attracted the attention of insightful people, and he also obtained the opportunity to learn painting and poetry from teachers; however, the learning conditions were still difficult. In the poem "Past Events Shown to My Children," we can also see his diligence, perseverance, and hardship in his early studies:

	Village books lacked, fate delayed, twenty-seven years before finding a teacher.
	What does it matter if the lamp has no oil? I burn pine torches to read Tang poems.

After the age of twenty-seven, he specialized in painting. Due to his persistent and unremitting efforts, his painting skills were highly developed. He not only became a professional painter, but also a famous painter with a wide range of enthusiasts after the age of fifty. He not only realized his ambition to become an artist, but also contributed countless beautiful paintings and other works of art to the people.

This artist, who came from the working class, has always loved his work and never interrupted his work unless for unavoidable reasons. According to his student and friend Li Keran, the old gentleman only took two breaks of ten days without painting, once when he was plagued by a serious illness, and once when he was hit by grief after his mother's death.

Qi Baishi was initially good at figure portraits, mastering meticulous techniques, and could realistically paint the patterns on the robes seen through the gauze clothing. After the age of forty, he changed his style and pursued "freehand" painting. However, his "freehand" painting has significant differences from general ink and wash games. His images are realistic, rather than ink and wash games starting from form. His works are rich in color, bright, and strong, neither trivial nor vulgar, giving people a fresh and diverse impression. Although they are small paintings, they do not have the shortcomings of being cramped and stingy. Even a single grass or tree truly has the effect of "combining spirit and form," giving people a feeling of abundant power. A "Frog and Water Chestnut" painted for Xu Beihong in 1945 has a strong sense of movement in the frog, as if it is jumping, and even gives people a feeling of playing. Moreover, the entire frog, painted with a few simple strokes, expresses its three-dimensionality and muscle elasticity through changes in the shades of ink. The water chestnut leaves are painted with saturated ink, so tender and full of life, that they can evoke a realistic feeling of being broken with a touch. Other examples include the hardness of the crab claws and the texture of the fluff, the patterns on the butterfly wings displayed by the single stroke of ink, and the movement and temporary stillness of the shrimp shown by the degree of opening and closing of the antennae... These are all examples of creating vivid images with simple tools. These seemingly impromptu freehand sketches, not only in the shape of objects, but also in the structure (how to use contrast and correspondence, how to highlight the key points, how to pay attention to the changes and harmony of strength, weakness, emptiness and reality [Note]), are not fundamentally different from meticulous works, and are not ink and wash games that can be done carelessly. In order to meet Lao She's request to express the line "frog sounds travel ten miles out of the mountain spring" through painting, he spent several days thinking, and finally expressed it by having groups of tadpoles come out of the valley along the mountain spring, allowing the frog sounds to be felt from the viewer's imagination. This can illustrate his work attitude and style, and also understand why a carpenter could become an outstanding painter.

If the subjects of the previous "freehand" painters were relatively narrow (such as Jin Dongxin's strength in painting plum blossoms, Shi Tao's strength in landscape painting...), then Qi Baishi was less restricted by the range of subjects, depicting various objects and expanding the range of subjects (this can not only prove the diversity of Qi Baishi's artistic images, but also prove that the expressiveness of ink and wash painting is not only limited to a few subjects, thinking that it cannot express more objects). Because he came from the people, he understood the people's preferences, and he absorbed the advantages of folk art, so even in the choice of subjects, he was not bound by the prejudices of scholar-officials, and chose subjects that were not valued by them but conformed to the people's tastes.

Although Qi Baishi did not have much contact with social issues in his life, when he did come into contact with social issues, he clearly showed the attitude towards life of an old man who had encountered many unpleasant things in the old society. In 1901, he painted a tumbler, which was a clown-like official wearing a black gauze hat with powder on his nose, an ugly and hateful image. Some people may think that this kind of cartoon-like work is indecent. However, the author painted such a subject and inscribed a satirical poem:

	Autumn fan waving on both sides, official robe neat and all black.
	Alas, you refuse to be overthrown, confident that there is no ink in your chest.

In the postscript, there is also such meaningful satirical language:

	...The eldest son thought it was a clever thing and said to me: When traveling far to Chang'an, I will carry it with me, make a model of it, and provide it for the needs of the children. I don't know that this thing is everywhere in the world...

He not only expanded the range of subjects, but also used various forms of expression, making the same type of subject have many changes. For example, the lotus flowers he painted not only created vigorous new lotuses and the remaining fragrant fading lotuses, and gave them upright, beautiful, and withered, cold shapes and tones, but also made people feel very obvious seasonal differences, thus forming different emotional infections. These achievements show that he had carefully observed the objects he was depicting, showing his high level of skill and artistic attainment. Qi Baishi, who had undergone arduous study and hard work, once again proved that artistic achievement can never rely on opportunism and accidental luck.

In order not to fall into the cliches of ink and wash games and formalism, in order to obtain the conditions for artistic creativity, and in order to create artistic images with a sense of reality, he traveled five times after the age of forty, traveling through half of China. For the same purpose, he raised grass insects and planted flowers and trees, making in-depth observations on their appearance and demeanor. Whether it is meticulous or "freehand," his frogs, katydids, grasshoppers, butterflies, dragonflies, cicadas, shrimps, and crabs are all lifelike. This is not only due to his excellent skills, but also due to his familiarity with the objects he depicts. Because he is familiar with the objects he depicts, he also puts forward the requirement of accurately depicting them, and thus constantly strives to improve the painting skills that are compatible with the objects he depicts. In-depth observation of objective reality is also the realistic basis for him to be able to freely use the laws without being bound by the laws of artistic expression, and it is also the reliable condition for him to respect the skills of his predecessors while avoiding inheriting the skills of his predecessors, and it is also an important reason why his works can be loved by the audience.

Whether it is his works or his remarks, they all show that Mr. Baishi believes in the importance of carefully observing and depicting objects. In addition to the frogs and crabs mentioned above, other examples include the transparent, externally hard and internally soft shrimp body, the dynamic of the jumping frogs, grasshoppers, and katydids, the bees vibrating their wings, the cherries with saturated juice and dazzling luster, the new lotuses and the fading lotuses, the elastic pine needles and the upright pine trunks, and the interweaving of the front and back of the plum blossom branches... all have a high sense of reality of the object. The formation of this sense of reality cannot but be attributed to his meticulous and in-depth observation. When one of his students was painting bananas, he omitted the veins of the banana leaves that should not have been omitted, violating the realistic state of the dense veins of the banana leaves. He believes that if the distance between the artistic image and the object is too large, it will not be a banana leaf. Like the advocacy of "the petiole of the loquat should be thick and the petiole of the winter melon should be thin," the image of objects such as bananas is required to be realistic. Some people may think that this is an insignificant and very ordinary common sense, but painters who have not carefully observed the objects often appear incompetent in the face of these ordinary phenomena.

Since details are the conditions that constitute the image, the representative details that must be emphasized must be realistic. If the details do not conform to the object, it is often because the observer does not recognize the importance of certain details and does not recognize the characteristics of the object. Whether it is the meticulous early grass insects or the "simple" late fruits, melons, flowers, and plants, they are all the result of careful observation of the objects being depicted. For "freehand" paintings that do not necessarily depict objects meticulously, if they have not been carefully observed, the viewer cannot feel the life of the image from the few strokes of the image. Because the "simple" image contains rich details, because he has incorporated the characteristics of the objects observed into the specific image, his "freehand" paintings have the power to be viewed and the realistic sense of the object that convinces the viewer.

Qi Baishi, who has always treated predecessors such as Xu Wei, Zhu Da, and even Wu Changshuo with an attitude of admiration, certainly attaches importance to the achievements of his predecessors and the laws of artistic expression. However, he does not inherit the old ways, nor is he bound by the laws of artistic expression. When he inscribed his landscape paintings, there was such a sentence: "Use my own brush and ink to write about my own landscape." This does not contradict the attitude of respecting predecessors; this is precisely the advocacy of emphasizing originality and opposing inheritance. Because he understands that the laws of artistic expression come from the understanding of the objects depicted by previous artists, when he depicts objects, he is not confused by the complicated phenomena of the objects, he can find certain laws, avoid triviality and disorder, and give a systematic description. But since art is not a rigid deduction of any formula, then, when creating images, we must start from specific objects and use reality and vividness as the standard for whether the application of laws is appropriate. His plum blossoms, lotus flowers, morning glories, and shrimp whiskers, etc., have achieved the effect of being complex without being disorganized in structure; precisely because of this, he broke through the shackles of the "female" shaped structure of plum blossom branches introduced in books such as "Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual," thereby achieving organizational and vividness in structure.

Qi Baishi, who values the brush and ink of Wu Changshuo and others, Qi Baishi, who is good at calligraphy and seal engraving, and Qi Baishi, who switched from meticulous painting to freehand painting after the age of forty, his later paintings do pay attention to the interest of brush and ink. However, the brush and ink that he pays attention to in painting can only be understood as the inheritance and promotion of the excellent national tradition, and can only be understood as the necessary skills for realistically and skillfully depicting objects, and should not be regarded as a formalistic display of pure calligraphy interest detached from the characteristics of the objects being depicted. If his painting style also belongs to the scope of literati painting, it is because his brush and ink have the characteristics of calligraphy. However, since he starts from the image rather than from the brush and ink, and does not use the image to show off the brush and ink, but in order to concisely, accurately, and skillfully portray the image, thereby achieving the unity of calligraphy interest and image, then his painting cannot be confused with the formalistic literati ink and wash. For example, when he paints shrimp, in the early years, in order to simplify the shape, he intentionally deleted some legs that did not damage the reality of the shrimp, and later, in order to simplify the image, he deleted some whiskers that did not damage the image of the shrimp. Because the audience appreciates the grass insects in art not to get an explanation of animal specimens, but to obtain artistic images that are more refined and more charming than facing real grass insects, Qi Baishi's works have this characteristic, so his works are welcomed by the majority of readers, and his style is realistic, not formalistic. Therefore, for Qi Baishi, we can only say that his later works are more refined, more concise, and more general in shape, and that under certain creative purposes, he has brought out the characteristics of brush and ink in the artistic processing and expression process. It is a prominent feature of Qi Baishi's works to allow the audience to see complexity in simplicity and to prominently exaggerate and emphasize the key points of objects. However, this is obtained through painstaking management, and it must not be thought that this is a kind of cutting corners or shoddy work, nor can it be thought that it has a principled divergence between realism and formalism with the meticulous and detailed early meticulous painting style.

Qi Baishi, a people's painter who inherited the excellent tradition of national art, not only enriched the people's spiritual life with his works, but also participated in the sacred cause of defending peace with his works, thus arousing the people's respect for him. His methods and attitudes in artistic creation, and his outstanding artistic achievements, have long been loved and respected by the people's art workers. Congratulating him on his ninety-third birthday not only expresses love and respect for him, but will also be the beginning of art workers earnestly studying his achievements in art and learning the excellent traditions of national art inherited and developed in his works.

[Note] Qi Baishi also emphasized the need for change in calligraphy in a poem written to art apprentices at the age of eighty: "...half like children, half like wind and clouds." According to his own explanation, this sentence means that "the skillful are as affectionate as children, and the rough are as changeable and elusive as wind and clouds." (Attached picture)

    杰出的画家齐白石
    ——祝贺齐白石的九十三岁寿辰
    王朝闻
    我们，中国的美术工作者，祝贺人民画家齐白石老先生九十三岁的寿辰，感到愉快和骄傲。因为他的精神劳动突出地表现了中国人民的艺术才能，因为他的创造性的精神劳动使人民的精神生活更丰富，因为他在艺术上的卓越成就对于美术工作者具有示范作用。
    齐白石，不仅是杰出的老画家，而且也是具有特殊才能的画家、治印家、诗人。他出生在湖南湘潭的一个农家，自幼热爱绘画，七岁就开始作画，可是，如同许多贫困家庭中的少年儿童一样，兴趣和愿望很难发挥和满足。他只读过半年书，在二十七岁之前，当过牧童，作过十五年木匠。在当木匠的时期，虽然白天经受了辛苦的劳动，晚上却不放松绘画练习，常常是一直到深夜都不休息。由于他在细木雕工及绘画上显示出特异的才能，引起识者的重视，他也才获得了投师学画和学诗的机会；可是学习的条件仍然是困难的。在“往事示儿辈”这一首诗里，也可以看出他当年学习时的勤奋、坚韧和艰苦：
        村书无角宿缘迟，廿七年华始有师。灯盏无
    油何害事，自烧松火读唐诗。
    二十七岁以后专门从事绘画，由于他坚韧的不懈的努力，绘画技巧得到高度发展，他不仅成为职业画家，而且在五十岁之后成为拥有广大爱好者的著名画家；不仅实现了他成为艺术家的志愿，而且对人们贡献了难以数计的优美的绘画及其他艺术品。
    劳动者出身的这位艺术家，一贯热爱自己的工作，除了不得已的原因，从来不间断自己的工作。据他的学生和朋友李可染说，老先生只有两次间隔过十天没有作画，一次是被重病所缠绕，一次是母亲死后被悲哀所摈击。
    齐白石早期长于人物写真，掌握工细的技术，可以逼真地画出从纱衣里透出来的袍上的花纹。四十岁以后改变作风，追求“写意”画。可是他的“写意”画和一般的笔墨游戏有显著区别。他的形象真实，而不是从形式出发的笔墨游戏。他的作品色彩浓丽、鲜艳、强烈，不琐屑也不庸俗，给人一种格调清新、形式多样的印象。虽是小品画，却没有局促和小气的缺点，即令是一草一木，也真正具备“神形兼备”的效果，给人一种力量充沛的感觉。一九四五年为徐悲鸿画的一幅“青蛙与荸荠”，青蛙的运动感很强，好像正在跳跃，甚至给人一种正在嬉戏的感觉。而且简单几笔所画出的整个青蛙，浓淡变化的墨色表现了它的立体感和肌肉的弹性。荸荠叶是饱和的墨汁所画出的，那样柔嫩和富有生气，可以引起对这嫩叶有一触即破的逼真感。其他如蟹爪的硬度和茸毛的质感，一笔蘸墨所画蝶翼所显示的蝶翼上的花纹，由于触须的开合程度所显示出的虾的游动和暂时静止的状态……都是用简单的工具创造出生动形象的例子。这些似乎是信手拈来一挥而就的写意的小品，不但在物象的造形上，而且在结构上（如何运用对照与照应，如何使重点突出，如何讲求强弱、虚实的变化〔注〕与和谐），其实和工笔的作品没有根本上的分歧，也都不是可以草草从事的笔墨游戏。为应老舍的要求，把“蛙声十里出山泉”这一诗句用绘画来表现，他费了好几天的思索，最后以成群的蝌蚪顺山泉出谷来表现，让蛙声从观者的想像来体会，这都可以说明他的工作态度与工作作风，也可以体会一个木匠出身而能够成为一个杰出的画家的原因。
    如果说前辈的“写意”画家的题材比较狭窄（如金冬心长于画梅，石涛之长于山水……），那么齐白石就较不受题材范围的限制，描绘了各种各样的物象，扩大了题材的范围（这不仅可以证明齐白石的艺术形象的多样性，也可以证明水墨画的表现力并不是只限制在少数的题材上，以为它不能表现更多的对象）。正因为他来自民间，他懂得人民的爱好，他吸取了民间艺术的优点，所以即令是在取材上，也不受士大夫画家的成见所拘，选择了不被他们重视而符合人民趣味的题材。
    齐白石虽然在生活上不大接触社会问题，但当他一旦接触社会问题的时候，也分明显示出在旧社会中曾经遭遇许多不愉快的老人，对于人生的态度。他在一九○一年画的一个不倒翁，是一个鼻梁上涂粉的小丑型的戴乌纱的官吏，形象丑恶可憎。这种近似漫画的作品，容或有人以为是不雅的。然而作者画了这样的题材，并题了讽刺性的诗句：
    秋扇摇摇两面白，官袍楚楚通身黑。嗟君不肯
    打倒来，自信胸中无点墨。
    在跋中还有这样意味深长的讽刺的语言：
    ……大儿以为巧物，语余：远游时携至长安，作
    模样，供诸小儿之需。不知此物天下无处不有也……
    他不仅扩大了题材范围，而且运用了各式各样的表现形式，使得同一类的题材具有许多变化。例如他所画的荷花，不仅创造了生气蓬勃的新荷和余芳未尽的残荷，并赋予挺拔、艳丽和枯萎、清冷的造形和色调，而且，使人感到非常明显的季节的区别，因而形成了各不相同的情绪的感染作用。这些成就，显示他曾经认真观察过描写的对象，显示着他的高度的技巧的修养和艺术的造诣。经过苦学苦练的齐白石，其创造性的劳动再一次证明：艺术的成就绝不能依靠取巧和偶然的幸运。
    为了不陷入笔墨游戏和形式主义的滥调，为了获得艺术的创造性的条件，为了创造具有真实感的艺术形象，他在四十岁以后五次出游，游历了半个中国。为了达到同样目的，养草虫，种花木，在外形和神态上作深入的观察。不论是工笔是“写意”，他的青蛙、蝈蝈、蚱蜢、蝴蝶、蜻蜓、蝉、虾和蟹都跃跃如生。这不仅由于他的技巧卓越，也由于他十分熟悉他所描绘的对象。正因为他熟悉了描写对象，也就提出准确加以描写的要求，因而不断努力，提高了和描写对象相适应的绘画技巧。对客观实际深入的观察，也就是他不被艺术的表现法则所束缚而能够自由运用法则的现实根据，也就是他十分尊重前人技巧而又能够避免因袭前人技巧的可靠条件，也就是他的作品能够获得观众喜爱的重要原因。
    不论是作品，不论是言论，都显示着白石先生认为认真观察描绘对象的重要。除了前面提到的青蛙、螃蟹之外，其他如透明的外硬内柔的虾体，欲跃的青蛙、蚱蜢和蝈蝈的动态，正在振动着两翼的蜜蜂，饱和液汁光泽耀目的樱桃，新荷与残荷，弹性的松针和挺拔的松干，梅花的枝干的正侧向背的穿插……都具备着物象的高度的真实感。这种真实感的形成，不能不归功于他的观察的精细和深入。他的学生中有人在画芭蕉时，省略了不应省略的蕉叶的经脉，违反了蕉叶经脉细密的真实状态。他认为：艺术形象和对象的距离太大，就不成其为蕉叶。如同“枇杷梗要粗大、冬瓜梗要细小”的主张一样，对于芭蕉之类的对象要求形象真实。容或有人以为这是不足道的十分平凡的常识，然而没有认真观察过对象的画者，常常不免在这些平凡的现象之前显得无能。
    细节既然是构成形象的条件，具有代表性的必须着重描写的细节必须真实。细节不符合对象，往往由于观察者不认识某些细节的重要性和没有认识到描写对象的特征。不论是工致的早期的草虫和“简略”的后期的瓜果、花卉，都是对于描写对象经过周密观察以后的结果。对于对象不一定绵密地加以描绘的“写意”画，如果没有经过周密观察，观者就不可能从寥寥数笔的形象中感到形象的生命。正因为“简略”的形象中包含着丰富的细节，正因为他已经把观察得来的物象的特征纳入具体形象之中，他的“写意”画才具备耐看的力量，也才具备使观者信服的物象的真实感。
    一直用崇拜态度对待前辈画家如徐渭、朱耷甚至吴昌硕的齐白石，当然是重视前人的成就和艺术的表现法则的。然而他不因袭旧套，也不被艺术的表现法则所束缚。他在题自己的山水画时，有这样的句子：“用我家笔墨写我家山水”。这，和尊重前辈的态度不矛盾；这，正好是强调独创性和反对因袭的主张。正因为他理解艺术的表现法则来自前辈艺术家对于描写对象的认识，所以他在描写对象时，不被对象的芜杂的现象所迷乱，找得到一定的规律，避免琐屑和零乱，给予条理的描写。但艺术既然不是任何公式的刻板的演绎，那么，在创造形象时就必须从具体对象出发，以真实和生动作为法则的运用是否得当的标准。他的梅花、荷花、牵牛花，以及虾的触须等等，在结构上，已经达到繁复而不零乱的效果；正因为这样，他才突破“芥子园画谱”等书所介绍的梅花枝干的“女”字形之类的结构法的桎梏，从而取得结构上的组织性和生动性。
    重视吴昌硕等人的笔墨的齐白石，长于书法和治印法的齐白石，四十岁之后从工笔画转到写意画的齐白石，他后期的绘画确实是讲究笔墨趣味的。然而，他在绘画上所讲究的笔墨，只能作为优良的民族的传统的承继和发扬来理解，只能作为真实和巧妙地描写对象所必需的技巧来理解，而不应看成形式主义的脱离描写对象的物象的特征的纯书法趣味的卖弄。如果说他的绘画的风格也是属于文人画范围的，那是因为他的笔墨具备书法的特长。然而他既是从形象出发而不是从笔墨出发，不是借形象卖弄笔墨，而是为了洗练地准确地巧妙地刻画形象，因而取得书法趣味与形象的一致性，那么，就不能把他的绘画和形式主义的文人墨戏混为一谈。例如，他画虾，早些年为了造形上的单纯，有意的删除一些不损害虾的真实性的腿，后来为了形象的单纯，又删掉了一部分不损害虾的形象的须。因为观众欣赏艺术中的草虫，不是为了得到动物标本的说明，而是为了获得比面对真实草虫更精粹、更具魅力的艺术形象，齐白石的作品具备这一特点，所以他的作品能受到广大读者的欢迎，而且他的作风是现实主义，不是形式主义的。因此，对于齐白石，只能说他的后期的作品在造形上更精粹更洗练更具概括性，只能说在一定的创作目的之下，其在艺术的加工与表现过程中，发挥了笔墨的特长。使观众在简中见繁与突出地夸张地强调物象的要点，这是齐白石的作品的显著特色。然而这是苦心经营所得来，决不能以为这是一种偷工减料或粗制滥造，也不能以为它和绵密的精细的早期的工笔画作风有写实主义和形式主义的原则性的分歧。
    齐白石，承继了民族艺术优良传统的人民的画家，不仅用他的作品丰富了人民的精神生活，而且用他的作品参加了保卫和平的神圣事业，因而更引起人民对于他的尊敬。他在艺术创作上的方法和态度，他的艺术的卓越成就，早为人民美术工作者所热爱和尊敬。祝贺他的九十三岁的寿辰，不仅表示对他的热爱和尊敬，而且将是美术工作者认真学习他在艺术上的成就的开端，学习存在他的作品中的承继和发扬了的民族艺术的优良传统。
    〔注〕齐白石在八十岁时教育美术学徒的诗中，对
    于作书，也有强调变化的主张：“……半如儿女半风
    云”。这句诗，按他自己的解释，是“工者如儿女之
    有情致，粗者如风云变幻，不可捉摸。”（附图片）
