Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 28th: In order to intensify the use of the Bao Dai puppet clique to achieve the goal of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," U.S. imperialism, together with French imperialism, has instructed Bao Dai to hold so-called "general elections" in villages and cities on January 25th.

The U.S., French imperialists, and the Bao Dai puppet clique touted this "election" as Vietnam's "first general election." Campaign cars equipped with loudspeakers provided by the United States raced through the streets; airplanes provided by the United States dropped leaflets over cities; every available wall in the streets was plastered with "election" advertisements. Propagandists used loudspeakers to threaten citizens, saying: "You must vote, abstaining is a crime!"

Although the Bao Dai puppet clique made great efforts, the people in the French-occupied areas were very indifferent to this so-called "election." On the day of the election, many people preferred to watch ball games or do other things rather than participate in the voting. Although the polling places were heavily guarded, many of those forced to vote still secretly ran home. A Reuters dispatch predicted that "the election" results will show that "spoiled ballots will be a large number."

The sham election conducted by the Bao Dai puppet regime this time under the orders of the U.S. and French imperialists not only cannot achieve their deceptive goals, but on the contrary has aroused greater dissatisfaction among the people in the occupied areas.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese "People's Weekly" recently published a commentary entitled "A New Trick of the Aggressors," exposing the sham elections held by the Bao Dai puppet regime in the French-occupied areas.

The commentary pointed out that the reason why the puppets hastily organized this "election" is that their French and American masters are facing many major difficulties, and their conspiracies to use Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese and to support war with war have suffered great setbacks. The Bao Dai-Nguyen Van Tam clique has clearly exposed themselves as despicable lackeys of the French colonialists and American interventionists. They are deeply hated and despised by the Vietnamese people. This fact makes the French colonialists and American interventionists very uneasy. They want to use the guise of democracy to whitewash their puppets in order to deceive the people in the occupied areas. On the other hand, the invaders and their puppets attempt to use this election to obtain detailed lists of voters so that they can conduct a detailed survey of the population in the occupied rural and urban areas, and finally force the people to join the puppet army, and it will be easier to squeeze money and property from the people.

The commentary said: People can clearly see that this election trick is only a means of deception by the French and American aggressors and their puppets. The invaders and their puppets believe that as long as they steal words such as "general election" and "democratic election," they can deceive the Vietnamese people. But they are very wrong. They expose their ugly faces like an owl with peacock feathers stuck on its body.

The enemy's fraudulent methods are clearly demonstrated in their election measures. The people in the election offices and election affairs committees are all designated by them. They will not announce the results until eight days after the election is held. This decision is to facilitate the manipulation of votes. The puppets greatly boast about the democratic nature of their elections, but even in the center of Hanoi, women do not have the right to vote; on the contrary, those who have obtained French citizenship and are therefore no longer Vietnamese citizens can participate in the election.

The commentary concluded by pointing out that the people in the occupied areas ignore the enemy's election trick, and the invaders' conspiracy will surely suffer the same disastrous defeat as their previous "reform" tricks.

    越南“人民周刊”发表评论  揭露保大傀儡伪选阴谋
    【新华社二十八日讯】西贡消息：美帝国主义为了加紧利用保大傀儡集团以达到“用越南人打越南人”的目的，已和法帝国主义共同授意保大，在一月二十五日举行所谓乡、市“普选”。
    美法帝国主义和保大傀儡集团把这次“选举”吹嘘为越南的“第一次普选”。由美国供给的装着扩音器的竞选汽车满街奔跑；美国所供给的飞机，在城市上空投掷传单；街头上每一块可以利用的墙壁上都贴满了“竞选”广告。宣传员们用扩音器向市民威吓说：“你们一定要投票，弃票就是犯罪！”
    保大傀儡集团虽然费了很大力气，但是法占区人民对这次所谓“选举”却非常冷淡。在选举的那一天，很多人宁愿去看球赛或做别的事情而不愿参加投票。投票处虽然警备森严，但被迫去投票的人仍然有许多悄悄跑回家去。路透社的消息预测说，
    “选举”结果将表明“废票是一个很大的数字”。
    保大傀儡政权这次奉美法帝国主义之命所进行的伪选举，不仅不能达到他们的欺骗目的，相反地已引起被占区人民的更大不满。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南
    “人民周刊”最近以“侵略者的新诡计”为题发表评论，揭露保大傀儡政权在法国占领区举行的伪选举。
    评论指出傀儡们匆忙组织这次“选举”的原因是：他们的法国和美国主子正面临着许多大困难，他们利用越南人打越南人和以战养战的阴谋受到很大的挫折。保大—阮文心集团已经很清楚地暴露他们是法国殖民者和美国干涉者的卑鄙走狗，他们受到越南人民的切齿痛恨和鄙视。这个事实使法国殖民者和美国干涉者非常不安。他们想用民主的伪装来把他们的傀儡粉饰起来，目的在欺骗占领区内的人民。另一方面，侵略者和他们的傀儡企图利用这次选举，来取得选民的详细名单，以便对被占领的乡村和城市地区的人口作一次详细的调查，最后可以迫使人民加入傀儡军队，并且可以更容易地榨取人民的金钱和财产。
    评论说：人们清楚地看出，这种选举把戏只是法国和美国侵略者和他们的傀儡的一种欺骗手段。侵略者和他们的傀儡们认为，只要他们窃取一些“普选”、“民主选举”之类的字眼，就可以欺骗越南的人民。但是他们大错特错了。他们好像身上插着孔雀毛的猫头鹰一样暴露了自己的丑恶面目。
    敌人的欺诈手段在他们的选举措施中表现得很清楚。选举的办事处和选举事务委员会里的人都是他们指定的。他们要在选举举行以后八天才公布结果。这种决定是为了便于操纵选票。傀儡们大大地吹嘘他们的选举的民主性质，但是甚至在河内市中心，妇女也没有选举权，相反地，那些曾经得到法国公民籍、因而不再是越南公民的人却可以参加选举。
    评论最后指出：占领区的人民不理会敌人的这套选举把戏，侵略者的阴谋诡计一定会和他们先前耍的“改革”把戏一样遭到惨败。
