    East China Establishes Geological Bureau
    Northwest Region Geological Personnel Concentrate on Winter Training
    Xinhua News Agency: The East China Geological Bureau has been established. In order to concentrate its strength, the East China Geological Bureau has abolished the Zhejiang, Shandong, and Fujian Geological Survey Institutes and concentrated all geological surveying personnel. After this group of personnel is concentrated, they are conducting a general survey of underground resources in East China and collecting data, actively preparing for the 1953 geological surveying work. Proceeding from the overall interests of national construction, the East China Geological Bureau has transferred a group of geological workers and a drilling team to support geological work in Northeast China, Central South China, and Northwest China. They plan to expand the existing geological cadre school and use the method of apprenticeship in practical work to train more geological workers, in order to meet greater tasks in the future and continue to support geological work throughout the country.
    Northwest region geological personnel have gathered to conduct winter training in order to welcome this year's large-scale resource exploration tasks. The Northwest Resource Exploration Bureau, the Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau, and other units have concentrated more than 500 geological personnel for winter training, including technical personnel and technicians in geology, surveying, seismology, gravity, testing, and cartography. The winter training is scheduled to last for one month, and the content focuses on summarizing the work of each field team and individual, and studying specialized business knowledge.
    The Northwest Resource Exploration Bureau divides the winter training into three stages: first, reading and discussing documents related to criticism and self-criticism; second, geological personnel examine the advantages and disadvantages in their thinking and work; and finally, conduct annual appraisals. Throughout the winter training period, a certain amount of time is set aside every morning to study professional skills, such as surveying team workers learning elementary algebra and "field operating procedures." The Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau, after completing the annual appraisal, also selected model field teams and individual models. Now, in addition to having specialists teach geology, surveying, and physics courses in the evenings, they also attend Russian classes four times a week in order to better accept advanced Soviet experience in the future.

    华东成立地质局
    西北区地质人员集中冬训
    华东地质局已经成立。为了集中使用力量，华东地质局撤消了浙江、山东、福建三个地质调查研究所，把所有地质勘测人员集中使用。这批人员集中后，正在对华东的地下资源进行普遍的调查和搜集资料的工作，积极准备一九五三年的地质勘测工作。华东地质局从国家建设的整体利益出发，已抽调出一批地质工作人员和一个钻探队支援东北、中南、西北等地的地质工作。他们计划扩大原有的一个地质干部学校以及在实际工作中用带徒弟的办法培养训练更多的地质工作人员，以迎接今后更大的任务，继续支援全国各地的地质工作。（新华社）
    西北区地质人员为迎接今年大规模的资源勘测任务，已集中起来进行冬训工作。西北资源勘测局、西北石油管理局等单位集中冬训的地质人员共五百多人，包括地质、测量、地震、重力、化验、制图等方面的技术人员和技工。这次冬训时间预定为一个月，冬训内容着重总结各野外队和个人的工作，并学习专门业务知识。
    西北资源勘测局把冬训分为三个阶段：首先是阅读和漫谈有关批评与自我批评的文件；其次，地质人员检查思想和工作中的优点和缺点；最后，做年终鉴定。在整个冬训期间，每天上午都抽出一定时间学习业务，如测量队的工人要学习小代数和“野外操作规程”。西北石油管理局在做完年终鉴定后，并评选模范野外队和个人模范；现在他们除晚间由专人讲授地质、测量、物理等课程外，每星期还上四次俄文课，以便今后能更好地接受苏联先进经验。（新华社）
