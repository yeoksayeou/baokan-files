    Fighting Solidarity, Noble Friendship
    Cao Zhenfeng
    I visited two heroic Chinese and Korean People's units fighting side by side on a frontline position in Korea.

    One afternoon, the sun had already sunk behind the high peaks of Yuyin Mountain to the west. A sea breeze blew, dark clouds gathered, and it immediately started to rain with a rustling sound. I took advantage of this lull in the artillery fire to go to the position of the Third Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    This position was a high ground jointly defended by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Its location was particularly prominent, like a sharp sword inserted into the enemy's heart. Since the enemy's so-called "Autumn Offensive" was crushed the year before last, these two heroic units have been fighting side by side, repelling more than a dozen enemy attacks. In front of this high ground, the corpses of over a thousand American aggressors have been buried.

    After crossing a high mountain, I arrived at the Third Company's headquarters, where I stayed that night. The next morning, I went to the command post of a certain company of the Korean People's Army. As soon as I came out of the shelter entrance, I saw a series of touching scenes. In the morning sunlight, the heavy machine gunners of the Chinese People's Volunteers were carefully helping the Korean People's Army soldiers learn how to use new weapons; the mortar gunners of the Chinese and Korean units were exchanging shooting experiences. When they couldn't communicate verbally, they wrote on the ground to communicate. At this time, a Korean People's Army cook was carrying water up the mountain. The Chinese People's Volunteers fighters in the trench greeted him warmly: "Tongmu (Comrade), you're working hard!" "My, not hard; comrades, very hard!" he replied happily.

    They are so close, so loving, and this noble friendship is even more evident in combat.

    Zhang Deyun, a telephone operator of the Third Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Li Bingshan, a telephone operator of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, are good friends. They met while completing a joint combat mission. Li Bingshan looked no more than twenty years old, wearing a gray woolen coat with several bullet holes in the lower left corner. The "First-Class Combatant Honor Medal" hanging on the left side of his chest shone with golden light, making his face even brighter. Li Bingshan used broken Chinese to tell me the story of how he and Zhang Deyun jointly completed a wiring task, ensuring the victory of the battle. Where words failed, he used gestures to demonstrate. He said: "American army attack, artillery, boom boom, telephone line... (He stretched his hands up, indicating the line was blown apart), Chinese People's Volunteers Company Commander Guo, 'Hello, hello,' no connection; Korean People's Army Deputy Battalion Commander Park, 'Hello, hello,' no connection either. Me, Zhang Deyun, all go (He lifted the hem of his coat, bent over and ran a few steps, making a wiring gesture). Artillery, hiss hiss... (He lay down) boom..., small, doesn't matter (He used his hands to indicate the shells exploding all around). Me, Zhang Deyun, forward!" Then he demonstrated how they crawled over the numerous shell craters to connect the broken wire ends. As soon as they connected it, it was blown apart again by artillery shells. So the two of them separated to connect the wires. Zhang Deyun asked: 'Hello! Comrade Li Bingshan, is it connected?' I shouted: 'Zhang Deyun Tongmu, connected! Connected!'" Li Bingshan said here, and they both laughed. Zhang Deyun continued, "Later, because the line was connected, guaranteeing command, our artillery launched a fierce bombardment of the enemy." These two close comrades-in-arms, in five months of fighting, ensured the smooth operation of the telephone, guaranteed the victory of the battle, and therefore both received meritorious service.

    I went to the command post of a certain company of the Korean People's Army with Guo Company Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers. These two neighbors were only a hundred meters apart. The shelter of the command post of a certain company of the Korean People's Army was a semi-tunnel-style fortification. Here I met Deputy Battalion Commander Park of the Korean People's Army. He returned to Korea from our country after the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea. He spoke fluent Chinese. At noon, he prepared a rich lunch for us. He kept putting slices of bread and beef into my bowl. He smiled and said to me: "Comrade! This is Hungarian bread, this is Chinese canned food and egg powder, this is Romanian sugar, this is a Korean specialty of fish... Eat, not much, but of great significance." The more he spoke, the more excited he became. Then he talked about the difficult days of the autumn of 1950; and then he talked about the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea, an event he will never forget. He said: "I remember one snowy evening, we met with the Chinese People's Volunteers comrades. We hugged tightly, tears streaming down our faces without even knowing it. I wanted to say so many words, but my throat was choked up. It took me a long time to say just one sentence: 'Comrades, you've come!' I really hoped to find an old comrade-in-arms among these comrades, but seeing everyone's face made me feel kind, familiar, as if I knew them all. Later, we fought side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers comrades, and advanced side by side."

    Deputy Battalion Commander Park talked endlessly. He also told me a touching story: "The enemy's cruel destruction has brought serious disasters to the Korean people. This spring (1952), the people here were very short of food. When the comrades of Company Commander Guo's company learned about this, in less than a day, they donated more than a hundred pieces of clothing and many shoes, and also took out six hundred pounds of grain to help the people here get through the disaster. The internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers comrades moved our fighters to tears..."

    At this time, Company Commander Guo interrupted Deputy Battalion Commander Park. He said: "We are all brothers! The Korean people take care of us like relatives, and the Korean People's Army comrades love us like brothers, which also educates every one of our fighters." Company Commander Guo turned to me and said:

    "Especially in battle, the support of the Korean People's Army comrades is something we will never forget. In January this year (1952), the enemy came down from Height 520.1 with more than a battalion of troops, attacking the forward position of our company's first platoon. Deputy Battalion Commander Park asked me: 'Do you need artillery support?' I said: 'We need it very much!' He said: 'Listen, it will be there soon.' In a little while, the light and heavy artillery of the Korean People's Army launched a fierce attack on the enemy, and our artillery also fired. As a result, more than two hundred enemies were killed or wounded. Our comrades know that our victory is inseparable from the support of the Korean People's Army comrades, and they have asked to request commendations for the Korean People's Army comrades." Company Commander Guo continued: "Every battle is won through the active cooperation of the two units. But each side wants to give the honor of this victory to the other." At this time, suddenly the sound of airplanes came from outside, followed by a burst of bombing and strafing, shaking the shelter and causing dirt to fall down with a swishing sound. Messenger Xiao Jin came in to report that three enemy planes were bombing the position of the Third Company of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Deputy Battalion Commander Park said angrily: "Tell the comrades, the position of the Third Company is also our position. Concentrate all firepower and hit them hard!" So, from the bunkers and trenches of the Korean People's Army position, fierce firepower was immediately launched, and two enemy planes were hit and caught fire amidst the fierce gunfire.

    Dusk is a relatively peaceful time on the front lines, and the sound of gunfire is sparse. Only searchlight beams shone over from the enemy's positions. In this lull of the war, the Chinese and Korean units held a joint celebration. Although the language was different, this did not hinder their enthusiastic exchange.

    The fighters of the Chinese and Korean People's units all loved their leaders, and they sang "The East is Red" and "Song of General Kim Il-sung" in both Chinese and Korean. They sang about their beloved motherland and sang about the heroes who sacrificed themselves to defend their motherland. The fighters sang one song after another, and shouts of "One more song!" "Josumida (Good)!" resounded throughout the venue. They sang and laughed heartily, and a united and friendly atmosphere filled the entire venue.

    Listen! The Korean People's Army fighters are singing loudly:
    "You crossed the mountains of Northeast China, you crossed the Yalu River,
    The great Chinese People's Volunteers have come,
    To eliminate the American aggressors—our common enemy.
    We cheer, we sing,
    Singing of the unity and fighting friendship of the Korean and Chinese people..."

    The Chinese People's Volunteers fighters are also echoing:
    "Chinese People's Volunteers, Korean People's Army,
    We are one family,
    We are all armed forces of the working people,
    We are all soldiers defending peace.
    We have one will, we are of one mind,
    Hand in hand, side by side,
    Advance bravely..."

    The fighting solidarity cannot be sung enough, the noble friendship cannot be sung enough! The singing is like the waves of the vast ocean, rising and falling. The singing wafts over the mountains of the frontline position, wafts in the Korean night sky. This is the song of justice, this is the song of victory, it is more powerful and stronger than anything else.

### 战斗的团结，崇高的友谊

    战斗的团结，崇高的友谊
    曹振峰
    我在朝鲜前线的一个阵地上访问了并肩作战的两支英雄的中朝人民部队。
    一天下午，太阳已沉到西边鱼隐山的高峰后面去了。一阵海风吹来，乌云密布，立时唰唰地下起雨来。我趁着这个炮火的空隙，到志愿军某部三连的阵地去。
    这个阵地是由志愿军和人民军共同守卫的一座高地。它的位置特别突出，就像插入敌人心脏的一把利剑。自从前年敌人的所谓“秋季攻势”被粉碎以来，这两支英雄部队就一直并肩作战，打退了敌人的十几次进攻。这座高地前面，已埋葬了千余名美国侵略者的尸体。
    翻过一座高山，就到三连连部了，当晚我就住在那里。第二天清早，我到人民军某连的指挥所去，一出掩蔽部门口，就看到一件件令人感动的事情。在早晨的阳光下，志愿军的重机枪射手们，正用心地帮助人民军战士们学习使用新武器；中朝部队的迫击炮手们则在一起交流射击经验。话讲不通，就在地上写字交谈。这时，人民军的一个炊事员正背着水走上山来。交通壕里的志愿军战士们，亲切地向他打招呼：“通姆（同志），辛苦啦！”“我的，辛苦的没有；同志，大大的辛苦！”他也愉快地回答着。
    他们是这样的亲密，这样的友爱，而这种高贵的友谊更表现在战斗中。
    志愿军某部三连的电话员张德云和人民军某部的电话员李炳山，是很好的朋友。他俩是在完成共同的战斗任务中相识的。李炳山看来也不过二十多岁，穿着一件灰呢大衣，大衣的左下角有几个弹孔，挂在他胸前左方的“一级战士荣誉勋章”闪耀着金色的光芒，使得他的脸更加明亮起来。李炳山用生硬的中国话向我叙述他和张德云共同完成一次接线任务，保证了战斗胜利的故事。有的地方词不能达意，他就用手势表演。他说：“美国军进攻啦，大炮，轰轰，电话线……（他把两手往上一张，表示线被炸断了），志愿军郭连长，‘喂喂喂’，不通；人民军朴副营长，‘喂喂喂’，也不通。我，张德云，通通去（他掀起大衣襟，弯腰跑了几步，作接线的姿势）。大炮，嘶嘶……（卧倒）轰……，小小的没有关系（他又用手比划炮弹在四面爆炸着）。我，张德云，前进！”接着他表演着他们两人如何爬过累累的弹坑，将断线头连在一起，刚接好，又被炮弹炸断了，于是他两个人就分开把线接好了。张德云问：‘喂！李炳山同志，接通了没有？’我喊：‘张德云通姆，通啦！通啦！’”李炳山说到这里，他俩都笑起来了。张德云接着说：“以后因为线接通了，保证了指挥，我们的大炮向敌人发起了猛烈的轰击。”这两个亲密的战友，在五个月的战斗中，保证了电话的畅通，保证了战斗的胜利，因此都立了功。
    我是和志愿军的郭连长一起到人民军某连指挥所去的，这两个邻居只相隔一百多公尺。人民军某连指挥所的掩蔽部是一个半坑道式的工事，在这里我会见了人民军的朴副营长。他是在美国发动侵朝战争后才从我国回到朝鲜的。他说得一口流利的中国话。晌午，他为我们预备了丰富的午餐。他不断地将面包片和牛肉放到我的碗里。他笑着对我说：“同志！这是匈牙利的面包，这是中国的罐头、蛋粉，这是罗马尼亚的糖，这是朝鲜特产的鱼……吃吧，东西不多，意义重大。”他越说越兴奋，接着他谈起了一九五○年秋天的艰难的日子；又谈起了中国人民志愿军入朝作战这件使他终生难忘的事情。他说：“我记得在一个风雪的晚上，我们跟志愿军同志会师了，我们紧紧地拥抱在一起，热泪流到了脸上还不知道，我想说好多话，但嗓子却哽咽了，好半天才说出了一句话：‘同志们，你们可来啦！’我很希望在这些同志中间能找到一个老战友，但是看到谁的面孔，都使我感到亲热、熟悉，就像我都认识他们似的。以后，我们就和志愿军同志们一起并肩作战，并肩前进了。”
    朴副营长滔滔不绝地谈着，他又给我谈了一件感人的事情：“敌人残酷的破坏给朝鲜人民带来了严重的灾荒。今（一九五二）年春天，这里的人民非常缺乏粮食。这件事被郭连长那一连的同志们知道了，于是，不到一天的功夫，他们就捐了一百多件衣服和许多鞋子，并且还拿出来六百斤粮食，送给这里的人民度过灾荒。志愿军同志们的国际主义精神，使我们的战士都感动得流泪了……”
    这时郭连长打断了朴副营长的话。他说：“咱们都是亲兄弟！朝鲜人民对我们像亲人一样地照顾，人民军同志们也像兄弟一样地热爱我们，这也教育了我们的每一个战士。”郭连长转过来向我说：
    “特别是在战斗中，人民军同志们对我们的支援，是我们永远也忘不了的。今（一九五二）年一月间，敌人从五二○·一高地下来了一个多营的兵力，向我们连一班前沿攻击。朴副营长问我：‘需要炮火支援吗？’我说：‘正需要哇！’他说：‘听着吧，说话就到。’不一会儿，人民军的轻重炮火就向敌人发起了猛烈的攻击，我们的大炮也发射了。结果，杀伤了二百多名敌人。我们的同志们知道，我们的胜利是与人民军同志们的支援分不开的，纷纷要求给人民军同志们请功。”郭连长接着说：“每一次战斗，都是在两支部队积极合作下取得胜利的。可是那一方都要把这胜利的荣誉给予对方。”这时，忽然从外面传来飞机声，接着就是一阵轰炸声和扫射声，震得掩蔽部唰唰地落下土来。通讯员小金进来报告，三架敌机正轰炸志愿军三连的阵地。朴副营长愤怒地说：“告诉同志们，三连阵地也就是我们的阵地，集中一切火力，狠狠地打！”于是，从人民军阵地的掩体里和交通壕里，立刻发射出猛烈的火力，两架敌机随着猛烈的枪声中弹起火了。
    黄昏，是前沿比较平静的时辰，枪炮声也疏稀了，只有探照灯光从敌人的阵地上射过来。在这战争的空隙里，中朝部队开了一个联欢晚会。虽然语言不通，但这并没有妨碍了他们的热情的交流。
    中朝人民部队的战士们都热爱自己的领袖，他们用中朝两国语言合唱了“东方红”和“金日成将军之歌”。他们歌唱自己的亲爱的祖国，歌唱那些为保卫祖国而牺牲的英雄们。战士们你唱一个，我唱一个，会场上到处喊着：“再来一个！”“昭斯米达（好）！”他们纵情地歌唱着，说笑着，团结、友爱的愉快气氛，充满了整个会场。
    听！人民军战士在高声唱：
    “你们翻过东北的山岳，你们跨过了鸭绿江，
    伟大的中国人民志愿军来了，
    为了消灭那美国侵略军——我们共同的敌人。
    我们欢呼啊，我们歌唱，
    歌唱朝中人民的团结，战斗的友谊……”
    志愿军战士们也在应和着：
    “中国志愿军，朝鲜人民军，
    我们是一家人，
    我们都是劳动人民的武装，
    我们都是保卫和平的兵。
    我们一个意志，我们一条心，
    携手并肩，并肩携手，
    勇猛向前进……”
    唱不完的战斗的团结，唱不完的崇高的友谊！歌声像那大洋中的万顷波涛，此起彼伏。歌声波动在前沿阵地的山岭上，波动在朝鲜的夜空中。这是正义的歌声，这是胜利的歌声，它比什么都有力、比什么都坚强。
