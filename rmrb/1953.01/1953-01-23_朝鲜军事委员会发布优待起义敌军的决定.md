Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 22nd: The Korean Central News Agency reported that the Military Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decision on the 9th regarding the treatment of defecting enemy soldiers.

The decision points out: The bloody lessons of the Fatherland Liberation War have awakened the high patriotic consciousness of the broad masses of the people. The burning hatred and disgust of the entire Korean people for the enemy is rising even higher, and even the national consciousness of the officers and soldiers of the so-called "National Defense Army" of Syngman Rhee is growing daily. The decision points out that Syngman Rhee's puppet army officers and soldiers are expressing increasing revulsion towards the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang. Among them, more and more people are realizing that they are merely tools and cannon fodder for the US imperialists' invasion of Korea. In order to oppose the violence, massacre policies, and various persecutions and abuses of the US-Rhee gang, and to oppose participating in the war that betrays the motherland, they are individually or collectively defecting to the embrace of the Republic.

The decision states: The Republic Military Committee considers these defectors' actions to be patriotic actions. The decision stipulates the following treatment for the defecting Syngman Rhee puppet army officers and soldiers: The past actions of the defecting former "National Defense Army" officers and soldiers will not be investigated, and they will be granted the rights and freedoms of citizens of the Republic. Those defectors who inflict losses on the enemy during the defection will be given state commendation. Those who defect with weapons and other military supplies will be awarded bonuses. If defectors request to join the Korean People's Army to fight against the US-Rhee gang, they will be incorporated into the Korean People's Army according to their respective arms of service, and will be granted the same military rank as their former "National Defense Army" military rank, or promoted according to their merits. Collective defecting units will not have their organization disbanded and will be incorporated into the Korean People's Army. Those defectors who request work will be helped to find suitable employment. Those defectors who request to engage in agricultural production will be helped to solve the problems of land and other production conditions. Those defectors who request to study will be allowed to enter relevant schools to study and enjoy publicly funded treatment.

The decision also stipulates that the above-mentioned preferential treatment will also be given to the family members of defectors and to defectors among the Republic's citizens who have defected to the enemy. The decision also stipulates that special preferential treatment will be given to defectors from foreign invading armies.
