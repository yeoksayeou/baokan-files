    French Government Refuses to Release Patriotic Figures Such as Léripe
    The French newspaper "L'Humanité" and "Libération" reported that the Paris Court of Appeals rejected the bail requests on January 8th of Alain Le Léap, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour, four leaders of the Republican Youth of France, and Ali Yata, Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party. The French government continues to imprison these patriotic figures under the pretext of "clarifying the truth," even though the investigation of their "cases" was completed long ago. As for Ali Yata, the reason for refusing release is that he "has no fixed address within French territory," which is truly a strange excuse.

    法国政府拒绝释放勒里普等爱国志士
    法国“人道报”和“解放报”说：巴黎上诉法院在一月八日驳回了法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普、法兰西共和青年联盟的四个领袖和摩洛哥共产党书记阿里·雅塔对保释的要求。法国政府继续监禁这些爱国志士，其口实是“为了把真相弄清楚”，虽然对他们“案件”的调查已早完结。至于阿里·雅塔，拒绝释放的理由是他“在法国领土内没有固定住址”，这真是一个奇怪的藉口。
