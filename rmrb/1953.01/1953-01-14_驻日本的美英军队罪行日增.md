    Crimes by US and British Troops Stationed in Japan are Increasing Daily
    According to an incomplete investigation by the Hiroshima District Public Prosecutor's Office of Japan, from the effective date of the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" on April 28, 1952, to the end of the same year, a total of 218 criminal cases involving British Commonwealth military personnel stationed in Hiroshima Prefecture occurred, with 268 people involved. Among the criminal cases, there were 55 cases of theft, 51 cases of assault, 27 cases of injury, and several cases of robbery and rape. However, none of these criminals have been prosecuted to date. According to the aforementioned official investigation, 14 criminal cases involving US military personnel occurred during this period, and all offenders have been "extradited" to the US military authorities.
    Even based on the Japanese official statistics regarding the crimes of US and British troops, which are obviously understated, one can see the true face of Japan's "independence."

    驻日本的美英军队罪行日增
    根据日本广岛地方检察厅所作的不完全的调查，自从一九五二年四月二十八日旧金山“和约”生效到同年年底为止，驻在广岛县的英联邦军人员的犯罪案件共达二百十八件，犯罪人员二百六十八人。犯罪案件中，有偷盗案五十五件，暴行案五十一件，伤害案二十七件，此外还有抢劫案和强奸案多起。但这许多人犯迄今没有一人被起诉。据上述官方调查，在此期间美军犯罪案件共发生十四件，所有人犯都已“引渡”给美军当局。
    即使根据日本官方关于美英军队罪行的显然缩小了的统计，人们也会看出日本“独立”的真面目了。
