Selling a Son to Pay Debts
    Cui Bawa
    I remember when I was ten years old, there was a terrible drought, and not a single grain was harvested from the fields. In the spring, people ate up all the wild vegetables and tree leaves, and later they filled their stomachs with "Guanyin earth" and palm tree buds. Eating these things, you couldn't excrete them, and many people died from eating them! Everyone in my family was skin and bones, our eye sockets were so deep, and our eyes were green. My dad said, "We can't eat this stuff anymore! Look how it's made the kids look, not like people at all. The Zhong family is eating "fire head roots" [Note 1], let's go dig some to eat too!" From then on, we went to the hillside every day to dig fire head roots, digging one day and eating the next. Alas! Too poor to really be poor, too hungry to really starve to death; on this precipice of being neither dead nor alive [Note 2], the creditors came swarming to our door.

    That day was a sunny day, the sun was as high as the treetops, and I was carrying my back basket, planning to go to the hillside to dig fire head roots. Mao's second daughter came again to demand the "empty granary grain" [Note 3] she had sold to us last year. She came in a huff, carrying a dipper in her hand, with two people following behind her, carrying shoulder poles and baskets, shouting as she entered, "Old Cui! Is it time to give the grain today?" She slammed the big dipper onto the threshold, twisted her hips, sat down on a grass stool, folded her arms, and stared intently at my dad. Dad quickly wiped a stool and greeted her, "Second daughter, please sit down." Before my dad could finish speaking, she waved her hand and frowned, "Don't bother with that, hurry up and give the grain, you said today was the day to carry it! I'm here to carry grain!" Dad sighed deeply and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed. My mom tried to reason with her, "Second daughter, please bear with us for two more days! We really have no way. Look how skinny the kids are! Alas—the pot is hanging up to be used as a bell, what can we use to pay you back?" When the second daughter heard that there was nothing to pay her back, she jumped up from the ground, swept her two strands of yellow hair behind her ears, and walked towards my mom, "What? You ate mine without a word and now you won't pay it back? Let's go!" Grabbing my mom's clothes, she said, "Let's go to the riverbank! You can drink up the river water and that'll be it." As she spoke, she dragged my mom to the ground. When Dongwaizi and I saw her dragging my mom, we pounced on her, scratching and hitting her. She saw my brothers hitting her, and took the opportunity to lie down on the ground, her hair disheveled, acting like a shrew. She slapped her thighs with loud thuds and howled like a wolf, "Ouch! You're so fierce, not only won't you pay the debt but you're hitting people!" Dad saw that we had caused trouble, and got angry at us, grabbing a stick from the woodpile and chasing after us, yelling, "You good-for-nothing things, why didn't you die sooner!" I dropped my back basket and ran, while Dongwaizi was beaten with two sticks and rolled on the ground crying. Dad smiled apologetically at the second daughter, "Second daughter, the little kids don't know any better, please don't take it to heart! We're not outsiders, we're distant relatives, please calm down." The second daughter raised her head and said, "What distant relatives? I want grain, you give me grain! You won't give grain today and you're hitting people?" Good heavens! She got angrier and angrier, and with a howl, she headbutted my dad in the chest: "Go ahead and hit me, it doesn't count unless you beat me to death!" Dad wasn't paying attention, and also didn't have any food in his stomach, so he was headbutted a good distance away. Before Dad could steady himself, the second daughter pounced on him again, grabbing his collar and scratching and hitting him. I don't know where she got the tears, she cried with disheveled hair, snot, and tears, "Everyone come and see—Cui Longzi owes me grain and won't pay it back, and he's hitting people!" While dragging Dad, she said fiercely, "Let's go! Let's go find the village head, and see if he says there's any justice!"

    Oh my! Look how fierce she was! She pushed people too hard! Dad couldn't bear it any longer, and with a strong effort, he flung her away, "How can you be such a rogue! I've said all the nice things I can say, it's not that I have grain and won't pay you. What? It's not just my family this year, what can I do? Sue me if you want!" Dad walked back into the house in a fit of pique. The second daughter didn't shout anymore, there were no tears on her face, she didn't say a word, and stood in the courtyard, staring blankly.

    The two people who came with the second daughter stood to the side, not speaking, and I didn't dare go over. Just at this moment, Liu Facai came swaggering in with a few people, carrying baskets and shoulder poles. Liu Facai was our landlord, and he had come several times already to demand last year's rent. Liu Facai entered the courtyard and saw the situation, and immediately understood most of it; he pretended to be confused and raised his voice to ask, "What's going on here?" The second daughter turned her head and saw that Liu Facai had come, and immediately pointed at him and said, "That's right, you came at just the right time today, this is the good tenant you recruited. He owes debts and won't pay them back, and he's hitting people. If I can't get it from him today, I'll get it from you! Your family eats delicious food and drinks spicy liquor, I'm not afraid of you!" This immediately angered Liu Facai, he stomped his foot and said, "What? I eat delicious food and drink spicy liquor? You're not bad either. Three or four people eat dozens of stones of corn, and have money to lend out, what more do you want?" He pointed his black lacquered cane at the baskets behind him! "Open your eyes and look, what did I come here for?" He took two steps closer to my dad, and pounded the ground with his cane: "Hey—Cui Longzi, what are you going to do? You told me to come today! You can't delay it anymore, right?" Dad glared at him, and after a long time, he said, "Landlord... my little kids don't even have fire head roots to eat, what do you want me to use to pay you back?" Dad's tears fell like a string of coins. Liu Facai listened impatiently and poked my dad's head, "Cui Longzi, don't be long-winded! I'm being fair to you, paying this year's rent with last year's grain, we agreed with Wang Xiuzi, I can't let the barren land go uncultivated, how did it get to this... be straightforward, what are you going to do?" My dad said, "Landlord... I can't sell anything, no one wants it! You can't squeeze any oil out of my bones! Please... please give me more time...."

    When Liu Facai heard that there was no hope, his gray face turned pale, he clenched his teeth, and said fiercely through his teeth, "Cui Longzi, what exactly do you want to do? Speak!" Dad shook his head and couldn't say anything, Liu Facai pointed his cane at Dad's face, forcing Dad, "Speak! Are you dead? Speak!"
    "..." Dad moved his body in fear, and lowered his head again.

    Seeing that Dad didn't speak, Liu Facai kicked Dad like a fierce god: "Aren't you dead! If you're not dead, then speak!" Seeing that Dad had no way out, Liu Facai glanced into the house with his bulging triangular eyes and said, "Good! Don't have any? If you don't have any, then get out of here!" He called out to the people outside, "Come on!" He said to my dad again, "No grain? Pull up the stove and lock the door and get out of here!" Before his words landed, the people who came with him swarmed into the house, some removing the stove, some carrying away the bedding, making a terrible mess.

    Liu Facai and his gang were so cruel! Our whole family begged him, but their hearts didn't even move, and they kept throwing things outside with all their might. Just as our whole family was crying to heaven with no way out, Wang Xiuzi from next door heard the commotion and came over, stopping Liu Facai, so he didn't lock the door. Later, Wang Xiuzi helped to say countless good words, and Liu Facai finally allowed a three-day deadline, and left in a huff. Wang Xiuzi pulled my dad and mom aside, and I don't know what she said, but Mom covered her head and cried all night.

    The next morning, Dad got up and pulled me to him, saying with tears in his eyes, "Bawaizi, I can't support you. In years like this, the wealthy families have food but no people to eat it, and the poor families have people but no food to eat, and the creditors are pushing us to the end of the road. Alas, for the sake of our family wanting to live a few more days, I'm selling you to Zheng Datou...." My heart felt like it was stabbed with a knife, and the whole family wailed in grief. Mom hugged me and said, "Bawaizi, come over and let Mom take another look!" She handed me the two remaining pieces of fire head root: "Child! Mom has nothing to give you to eat, you eat this. After you eat it, you'll become someone else's person. Child, don't forget, Mom raised you so big, eating chaff and vegetables, and cleaning your poop and pee..." Saying this, Mom hugged me and cried her heart out.

    Seeing that it was almost noon, Dad hardened his heart and said, "Stop crying! Crying won't help, let's go." He came over and grabbed my arm.

    "I don't... I don't want to go to the Zheng's... Mom, I don't want to go!" I hugged Mom's neck and wouldn't let go. "My heavens! You're... the flesh that fell from my heart, my son..." Mom's hot tears flowed onto my face. Dongwaizi also hugged my leg and cried, "I want my brother... I don't... want my brother to go..." Dad stomped his foot, sobbing, "Child... Dad's heart... isn't... made of iron... Bawaizi... you're saving our whole family's life. You go first! Dad will find a way to redeem you later." After saying this, he dragged me out of Mom's arms and left. At that time, although I was only ten years old, I understood some things, and in order to save my family's life, I had no choice but to go to someone else's house first. Later, I heard that they could still redeem me, so I walked and cried, "Mom, redeem me! Mom!..." I walked so far with Dad, and I could still hear Mom crying with a hoarse voice, "My heavens... I sold my ten-year-old son..."

    We walked twenty li, and my father and I didn't stop crying. When we were about to get to the Zheng's house, we wiped our tears, and Dad told me not to cry, saying that people wouldn't like it if I cried. As soon as we entered the Zheng's gate, we heard a lot of noise in the main room, and many guests had been invited. Zheng Datou walked out, pursed his lips, and said with a smile, "Old Cui, you've come! If you've come, then hand over the grain, three stones of grain, two stones for Liu Facai and one stone for the second daughter, let's settle the accounts face to face, and we'll be clear." He turned his head and shouted to the backyard, "They're here, hand over the grain to them!" He came over and patted me on the head, "So tall, what's there to cry about selling for three stones of grain? Is it because you're reluctant to part with him? If you're reluctant, then take him back, and the grain is still mine." Dad hurriedly wiped his eyes with his sleeve and said, "I'm not crying, I'm not crying." Zheng Datou squeezed his eyes, baring his yellow teeth and saying, "What's there to cry about? You've come to paradise. Humph!" The guys who came to my house to demand grain yesterday came out of the backyard carrying grain, and carried it away in front of us. Dad was about to go back without eating, and I sent him to the gate. Dad turned around and grabbed my hand, trembling and saying, "Bawaizi, I'm sorry to you! From now on, don't call me Dad anymore! I'm cruelly cutting off a piece of flesh from my body, do you have anything to say to your mom?" My throat felt like it was stuffed with something, and I couldn't say a word. Dad took a close look at me again, and walked east alone with tears in his eyes, taking a few steps and looking back. I waited until he went down the slope and disappeared before I turned around. I looked to the west and could still clearly see the grain carriers going west. I remembered Dad saying that people wouldn't like it if I cried, so I sat on the threshold and wiped my tears, wiping them again and again, but I could never wipe them dry. At this time, Zheng Datou shouted again: "Bawaizi, you little dog thing, where did you run off to again?" I wiped my eyes with my sleeve and slowly walked in.

    卖子还账
    崔八娃
    记得我十岁那年闹荒旱，地里没打下一颗粮食。春天里人们把野菜树叶吃得光光的，后来就找观音土和棕树苞苞来填肚子。这些东西吃下去，就屙不下来，吃死了好多人哪！我们一家人都个个吃得皮包骨头，眼窝陷得多深，眼珠子都发绿了。我爹说：“这东西再不能吃了！看把娃娃大小吃得不像人啦，钟家他们吃的火头根〔注一〕，咱们也去挖些吃罢！”从这以后我们天天到坡上挖火头根，挖一天吃一天。唉！穷也穷不利洒，饿也饿不干净；在这死不得死，活不得活的阶坎上〔注二〕，账主子又都偎上门来了。
    那天是个大晴天，日头有树梢高，我背上背笼打算到坡上挖火头根，毛家二女子又来要去年卖给她的空仓粮〔注三〕。她气汹汹地手里提着斗，屁股后头跟着两个人，扛着扁担提着箩筐，进门就喊：“老崔！今天该给粮食了吧？”把大斗朝着门坎上一放，尻子一扭坐在草墩上，两手盘起，眼睛死死地盯着我爹。爹赶忙擦了擦凳子招呼她：“二女子请凳上坐吧。”没等我爹说完，她手一摆眉头一皱：“不要扯那些，急忙给粮食，说是今天挑嘛！我是来挑粮食的！”爹长叹一口气，慢慢地坐在床沿上。我妈给她讲好话：“二女子请你再凑合两天吧！咱们实在没法。你看娃娃们瘦成一把骨头啦！唉——锅吊起来当钟打，拿啥来还你呢？”二女子听说没啥还她，从地上猛的蹦起来，把她两根黄毛往耳后一掠，朝我妈走过来：“怎样？你红口白牙地吃了我的，这会不还？走！”抓住我妈的衣裳说：“咱们到河坝里去！你把河水喝干算啦。”说着，她就把我妈往地下拖。我和东娃子看她拖我妈，就扑到她身上又抓又打，她瞅我弟兄打她，趁势朝地下一躺，头发披散，耍起赖来了。拍得大腿卟达卟达响，狼一样干嚎：“哎哟！你们好厉害呀，不还账还打人哪！”爹看惹下祸啦，就朝我们发气，顺手在柴堆上抽了根条子，撵到我们就打，嘴里骂着：“你们这些不成器的东西，为啥不早些死啊！”我丢下背笼就跑，东娃子挨了两条子在地上滚着哭起来。爹又陪笑对二女子说：“二女子，小娃子不懂事，你千万莫见怪呀！都不是外人，论起来咱们还是个远亲，请你消消气吧。”二女子把脑壳一扬说：“什么远亲？我是要粮的你给我粮！今天你们不给粮还打人？”好家伙呀！她越说越气，嗥的一声朝爹胸口一头撞去：“给你们打吧，不打死不算人！”爹不留神，也是肚里没食，被她一头撞多远。二女子没等爹站稳就又扑过去，抓住爹?领子又抓又打。也不知道她那里来的泪，她披头散发一把鼻涕一把泪地叫：“你们都来看啦——崔聋子欠我的粮不还，还打人哪！”一边拖着爹狠狠地说：“走！咱去找保长去，看你说理不说理？”
    哎哟！瞧她有多厉害！太把人逼狠了！爹再也忍不住，就用力一下把她甩开：“你这婆娘怎么这样赖皮！好话给你说尽了，我不是有粮不还你。怎么？这年头不是我一家，我有啥法？你愿告就告！”爹赌气走回屋里去。二女子这回可不叫了，脸上也没泪了，一句话不吭，站到院里瞪着眼珠子发呆。
    跟二女子来的两个人在一旁，也不讲话，我也不敢走过去。正在这个阶坎，刘发财带着几个人拿着箩筐扁担，摇摇摆摆地又来了。刘发财是我们的地主，他来要去年的租子，已经来过几回了。刘发财进了院子一看这个架势，早明白了八九分；他装糊涂扯起嗓子问：“这是怎么回事啊？”二女子扭头一看是刘发财来了，马上指着他说：“对，你今天来得正好，这是你招的好地客啊。欠账不还，还打人。今天我向他要不到，我向你要！你家吃香的喝辣的，我可不怕你！”这一下可把刘发财惹躁了，他脚一跺，说：“什么？我吃香喝辣？你们也不坏呀。三四口人吃几十石稞子，有钱放账，你还想怎么？”他掂着他那个黑油漆的棍棍子，朝背后的箩筐一指！“你睁眼看看，我是来干啥的？”两步凑近我爹跟前，用棍把地捣得咚咚响：“喂——崔聋子，怎么办？你说叫我今天来啊！现在可没再推辞的了吧？”爹白了他一眼，半天才说：“主人家……我这大小娃娃火头根都没吃的，你叫我用什么还你啊？”爹的眼泪钱串一样卟簌簌地往下掉。刘发财听着不耐烦，把我爹的头一拨拉：“崔聋子，别噜囌！我对得起你，去年租子今年还，咱们和王秀子讲得好好的，我是荒地不能荒稞，怎么到这会……你干脆点，怎么办？”我爹说：“主人家……我卖东西都没人要哇！你要我骨头都轧不出油来啊！还是求求你再……。”
    刘发财一听没指望了，灰蹙蹙的脸上变得煞白，把牙巴骨一错，从牙缝里狠狠地说：“崔聋子，你到底想怎么办？说！”爹摆了摆头说不出啥话，刘发财棍子指到爹的脸上，逼着爹：“你说！你死了嘛？说话！”
    “……”爹害怕地挪了挪身子，又把头低下。
    刘发财见爹不说话，凶神一样朝爹飞身就是一脚：“你没死吧！没死就讲话！”刘发财看爹没法，鼓起三角眼向屋里一望说：“好！没有？没有就给我滚蛋！”朝门外的人招呼：“来人！”又对我爹说：“没粮？拔锅锁门子给我滚！”话没落地，跟来的人一窝蜂一样都拥到屋里，有的揭锅，有的抱铺盖，闹得一塌糊涂。
    刘发财他们好狠的心哪！我们全家哀求他，他们的心连动一点都不动，还是一股劲地把东西朝外甩。咱们全家正哭天无路的时候，隔壁王秀子听到吵闹赶来了，上去把刘发财拦住，才没给把门锁了。后来王秀子帮着给说没数的好话，刘发财才允许再给三天限期，气昂昂地走了。王秀子把我爹我妈拉到一边，不知道说了些啥话，妈蒙着头直哭了一夜。
    第二天早晨起来，爹把我拉到跟前，淌着眼泪说：“八娃子，我养不活你了。这样年成财主家有吃没人，穷人家有人没吃，账主子逼得没路可走。唉，为了咱们一家人还想活几天，我把你卖给郑大头了……。”我心里像刀扎一样，全家哇的一声恸哭起来。妈抱着我说：“八娃子过来再叫妈看一眼！”把剩下的两块火头根递给我：“孩子！妈没东西给你吃，你把这吃了吧。吃了，就成人家的人了。孩子，别忘了，妈吃糠咽菜一把屎一把尿把你拉扯这么大……”说到这里，妈抱住我哭得死去活来。
    看看天快晌午了，爹狠了狠心说：“莫哭啦！哭也不顶事，咱们还是走吧。”过来拉住我的胳膊。
    “我不……我不到郑家……去呀！妈呀，我不去！”我抱着妈的脖子不丢手。“我的天哪！我……?掉……心上的肉哇，我的儿啊……”妈的热泪流到我的脸上。东娃子也抱着我的腿哭：“我要哥……我不……叫哥走哇……”爹把脚一跺，抽抽噎噎地说：“孩子……爹心……不是……铁打的呀……八娃子……你就算救了咱全家的命。你先去吧！爹以后再想法赎你。”说罢，就从妈怀里把我拖起走。那时候我虽说才十岁，也懂得一些事情，为了一家人活命，只有先到人家屋里。后来又听说还能赎回我来，我就一边走一边哭着：“妈，赎我回来！妈呀！……”我跟爹走了多远，还听着妈哑嗓子在哭：“我的天呀……我把十岁的儿子都卖了……”
    走了二十里路，我父子两个眼泪没停。要到郑家了，我们擦了擦眼泪，爹叫我别哭，说哭人家不喜欢。一进郑家大门，就听到堂屋里吵吵闹闹请了好多客。郑大头走出来，嘴一撇，笑着说：“老崔，你们来啦！来了就过粮，这三石粮食是刘发财两石，二女子一石，当面过粮，咱们是两清。”他扭回头朝后院子喊：“他们来了，把粮过给他们吧！”又过来在我头上一拍：“这么高，卖了三石粮食还有什么哭的呢？该是舍不得吧？舍不得就引回去，粮食还是我的。”爹忙拿袖子把眼一抹，说：“没哭，没哭。”郑大头挤了挤眼，龇着满口黄牙说：“哭啥？你这不是到天堂来啦。哼！”昨天到我家讨粮的那几个家伙从后院里担粮出来，从我们面前担走了。爹没吃饭就要回去，我送他到大门外头。爹调转头来拉着我的手，颤颤抖抖地说：“八娃子，我对不起你呀！从今以后，不要叫我爹啦！我是狠心挖掉身上一块肉，你有啥话给你娘说吗？”我嗓子像什么东西塞得满满的，一点也说不出来。爹又把我细瞅了一眼，独自淌着眼泪向东走了，走几步，回头望一望。直等他下坡看不见了，我才转过身来。我向西一看，还清楚地看到担粮食的往西去。记得爹说，哭，人家不喜欢，我坐在门坎上擦擦眼泪，擦一把又一把，总是擦不干。这时郑大头又喊了：“八娃子，小狗东西，又钻到那里去了？”我用袖子把眼擦了擦，才慢慢地走进去。
