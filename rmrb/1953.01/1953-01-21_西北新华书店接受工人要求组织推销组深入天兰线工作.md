To the Editor:
　　We wrote to you previously reflecting the problem of "Workers on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway Line urgently needing cultural nourishment." After this letter was published on the "Letters from Readers" page on July 9th last year, the Northwest General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore organized a mobile sales team to work along the Tianshui-Lanzhou line, providing cultural nourishment to the workers. This sales team not only supplied books and newspapers at the sections but also went to the contingents and penetrated into the work teams. The supply of books was considerable, including popular theoretical books, technical and scientific books, and comic books. The comrades greatly welcomed the sales team. Everyone deeply appreciates the motherland's care and consideration for us workers, and supports the Northwest General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore's action of accepting workers' opinions and actively serving the workers. Now, the workers' further hope is: to ask the sales team to bring more new books and magazines in the future.

    西北新华书店接受工人要求组织推销组深入天兰线工作
    编辑同志：我们前次写信给你们，反映“天兰线工人迫切需要文化食粮”的问题。这封来信在去年七月九日“读者来信专页”上发表以后，新华书店西北总分店就组织了巡回推销组到天兰沿线工作，供给工人们文化食粮。这个推销组不但到段上供应书报，而且还到联队并深入到班里去。供应的书很不少，有通俗理论书籍，有技术科学书籍，还有连环画等。同志们对推销组极为欢迎。大家深深感谢祖国对我们工人的关心和照顾，拥护新华书店西北总分店接受工人意见、积极为工人服务的行动。现在工人们进一步的希望是：要求推销组以后多带些更新的书籍杂志来。李宪章　张平
