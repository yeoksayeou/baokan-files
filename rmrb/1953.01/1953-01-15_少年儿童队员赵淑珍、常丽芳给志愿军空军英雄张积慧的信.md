    Letter from Young Pioneers Zhao Shuzhen and Chang Lifang to Zhang Jihui, Hero of the Volunteer Army Air Force

    Dear Uncle Zhang Jihui:

    Please accept our heartfelt and affectionate greeting! When we saw your photo in the newspaper and heard our teacher tell us about your heroic deeds, how happy and grateful we were! We wish we could go to the front lines to see you right away. Your patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism have inspired our enthusiasm for learning. We all take you as our role model. Whenever we don't pay attention in class, or don't want to do our homework when it's time for self-study, or encounter difficulties in learning, we think of you, Uncle, and our motivation to study returns. I remember once when we didn't do well on an exam, we were so sad that we cried in front of your photo that night. Since then, we never waste time again.

    This New Year, we helped military families with their chores, and we don't know where this energy came from, but we were all the more happy the more we worked. The uncles and aunts urged us to go back, but we didn't want to leave. Uncle, please rest assured and kill the enemy, things are going well at home!

    Our school is currently carrying out a model airplane building campaign, and everyone's enthusiasm is very high. Even if our fingers get hurt, it won't stop our strong will. Everyone says: "Make a good airplane to see Uncle Zhang Jihui!" Now our classmates have made many model airplanes. Everyone is saying:

    "We are the future aviation pilots." Yes, for this purpose, we pay attention to exercising! Although the weather is cold, we still run, kick shuttlecocks, and play on the horizontal and parallel bars, and our bodies are much stronger than before. Uncle! Let us send you an interesting gift - a photo of the two of us sitting in a model airplane - you will be especially happy. We are sitting in a fake airplane now, but in the near future we will be flying real airplanes, flying in the lovely skies of our motherland.

    Young Pioneers Zhao Shuzhen, Chang Lifang, Xiumen No. 1 School, Shijiazhuang

### 少年儿童队员赵淑珍、常丽芳给志愿军空军英雄张积慧的信

    少年儿童队员赵淑珍、常丽芳给志愿军空军英雄张积慧的信亲爱的张积慧叔叔：
    请接受我们从内心发出来的亲切的称呼吧！当我们从报纸上看到了你的照片和听到老师讲到你的英勇事迹时，我们是何等的高兴和感激啊！我们恨不得立刻到前线见见你。你的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的精神鼓舞了我们的学习情绪，我们都以你为榜样。每当我们上课不专心听讲时、该是自习的时候而不愿作业时、以及在学习遇到困难时，一想到叔叔你啊，我们学习的劲头就来啦。记得有一次我们考试成绩不好，那天晚上我们便对着你的照片难过得流泪。自那以后我们就再也不浪费时间了。
    这次新年，我们给军属干活，也不知从那来的这股劲，大家越干越欢。大伯、大娘们催我们回去，我们还不愿走。叔叔安心杀敌吧，家里的生活可好哩！
    我们学校这次开展制造飞机模型运动，大家的情绪可高啦，手指弄伤了也阻挡不住我们的坚强意志。大家都说：“做好飞机去见张积慧叔叔！”现在我们同学已做成了好多架飞机模型。大家都说：
    “我们是未来的航空驾驶员。”是的，我们为了这个目的，可注意锻炼身体哩！天气虽冷，我们还是跑步、踢毽子、玩单双杠，身体比以前壮的多了。叔叔！让我们送给你一件有意思的礼物——我们两个坐着模型飞机的照片——你一定会特别高兴的。我们现在坐的是假飞机，不久的将来我们会驾驶着真的飞机，飞翔在祖国可爱的天空。
    石家庄市休门一校少年儿童队员  赵淑珍  常丽芳
