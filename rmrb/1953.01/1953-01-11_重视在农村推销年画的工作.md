    Emphasize the Work of Promoting New Year Pictures in Rural Areas
    Editor: With the improvement of economic life and cultural level, farmers' demand for buying New Year pictures during the Spring Festival is becoming more urgent. Therefore, the publication and distribution of New Year pictures cannot be ignored. Last year, the Xinhua Bookstore in Yinan County, Shandong Province, received a batch of New Year pictures from the provincial branch, but due to poor distribution work, a large number of New Year pictures were stockpiled, preventing farmers from buying them. Therefore, I suggest that this year, Xinhua Bookstores in various regions should entrust the district and village cooperatives to sell New Year pictures on their behalf. When district and village cadres assist in promoting New Year pictures, I hope they will attach importance to this work, which is rich in educational significance.

    重视在农村推销年画的工作
    编辑同志：随着经济生活和文化水平的提高，农民在过春节时对购买年画的要求更加迫切了。因之，新年画的出版、发行工作是不容忽视的。去年山东省沂南县新华书店由省分店批下来一部分年画，由于发行工作作得不好，把大批年画积压起来，使农民买不到年画。因此，我建议今年各地新华书店应委托各区、村合作社代销年画。区、村干部协助推销年画时，希望把这富有教育意义的工作重视起来。
