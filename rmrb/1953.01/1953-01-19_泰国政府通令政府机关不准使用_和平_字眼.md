    Thai Government Orders Government Agencies to Prohibit the Use of the Word "Peace"
    The Thai "Bacha Kung Bao" recently reported that the Thai Ministry of the Interior has issued a notice to all government agencies and administrative commissioners of all provinces, prohibiting the use of the word "peace" when implementing any measures.
    This is because "peace" has already made the reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government of Thailand tremble.

    泰国政府通令政府机关不准使用“和平”字眼
    泰国“巴差功报”最近报道，泰国内政部通令各政府机关和各府的行政专员，禁止在执行任何措施时使用“和平”字眼。
    这是因为“和平”已经使泰国反动的銮披汶政府发抖了。
