Party Life

    Editor's Note: The Party organizations in Northeast China have promptly paid attention to propaganda work in basic construction and have gained initial experience. This is a correct approach to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction. Party committees with basic construction tasks should also place the propaganda work of basic construction in a primary position, strengthen the class education of workers, publicize the great significance of basic construction to the country's industrialization, and encourage workers' labor enthusiasm.

    In 1952, the basic construction tasks in Northeast China doubled compared to 1951. Before and after the start of construction, the number of Party members and Youth League members among basic construction workers was very small. In the industrial departments, Party and Youth League cadres who were separated from production accounted for only one in three thousand of all employees; in Heilongjiang Province, they accounted for only 0.28 percent. Many construction sites did not have basic-level Party and League organizations at all. Therefore, Party committees at all levels took timely measures to strengthen political work in the basic construction sector. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company established a basic construction political department, and political sections were established in various engineering companies and some important construction sites; moreover, a political instructor system was established in some newly established engineering teams to ensure the implementation of political work. The CCP Harbin and Changchun Municipal Committees transferred more than 200 cadres, cultural instructors, and broadcasters from the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Industrial Department, and trade unions and the Youth League to work on the construction sites. The CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committees, in addition to transferring some propaganda cadres from mines and factories, also actively promoted some cadres to replenish the propaganda departments. The Northeast Bureau Propaganda Department also sent cadres to serve concurrently in certain propaganda positions in various work areas, construction sites, and engineering teams. This initially strengthened political and propaganda work in the basic construction sector.

    I. Organizing Cultural Service Teams to Go Deep into Construction Sites

    Basic construction sites are extremely dispersed. Transportation is inconvenient, and the political work organizations at each construction site are newly established. The work foundation of the trade union cultural and educational departments is weak, and the mass propaganda organization of the Party is also unsound. These are the characteristics of general new construction sites.

    In order to strengthen workers' cultural and recreational activities at construction sites and dormitories, the propaganda departments of local Party committees organized basic construction cultural service teams. They were composed of the Municipal Youth League Committee, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Xinhua Bookstore, under the direct leadership of the trade union cultural and educational departments. They used their spare time to carry out various propaganda and education activities at construction sites and dormitories. The activities of the cultural service teams mainly included: showing movies and slides, performing dramas and operas, exhibiting books and pictures (including picture posters introducing Soviet communist construction and employee life, the great motherland, advanced production experience, and advanced figures), recreational activities (various chess, poker, croquet, etc.), teaching singing, story evenings, recreational competitions, and various forums. In July last year, the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Cultural Service Team showed a total of 39 movie screenings, including 14 films such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," and "The Victory of the Chinese People." Thirty-five slide shows were performed, including seven films such as "Su Changyou and His Group" and "Learning Xie Wanfu's Assembly Line Method." Twenty-two drama performances were held, including 17 short and pithy programs such as "The Useless Old Iron Shovel," "Visiting the New House," and "Promoting Advanced Experience." Mobile exhibitions of books, newspapers, and pictures and story evenings were held 15 times, and nearly 3,000 books were sold. A cumulative total of approximately 238,000 employees participated in the activities. On average, each construction worker could watch movies, slides, and dramas about five times a month.

    This kind of organized cultural and recreational activity has played a significant role in raising the class consciousness of basic construction workers, expanding their political and cultural horizons, increasing various knowledge, especially changing labor attitudes, improving project quality, and learning advanced experience. Most civil construction workers used to carry a box of tools on their backs, work and eat wherever they went, and were conservative in their thinking and undisciplined in their actions. However, after education, they actively demanded to learn culture and improve their skills, and many moving deeds emerged. After watching the movie "The Land Regains Light," an old worker in the engineering team forgot about the illness in his leg and resolutely demanded to return to work on the construction site. Another example is that when carpenter Han Zhiyuan's research and creation of the "biting-tip counter-riveting machine" was unsuccessful, he was a little discouraged, but after watching the movie "Marching Forward in High Spirits," he was moved and worked hard, finally successfully creating it, increasing work efficiency by 1,700 percent.

    The CCP Anshan Municipal Committee put forward the slogan "Cultural and educational work should go deep into the dormitories." The cultural and educational workers in Anshan went to the dormitories to help the workers establish a dormitory democratic management committee, mobilized all the workers in the dormitory to build a stadium and add sports and recreational supplies such as huqin by using Sunday's time. And it used one evening's spare time to pad up 76 cubic meters of earth platform; the open-air theater began to operate, showing movies and dramas, and the cultural life of the workers was initially active. The workers demanded to learn culture, so they were organized to study at nearby night schools. The appearance of the dormitory was completely new. The workers automatically wrote such slogans in the dormitory: "The construction site is the battlefield, the dormitory is our home. A good home makes us refreshed, and we can win the battle on the battlefield."

    The Qiqihar City Cultural Service Team helped establish 13 workers' literary and artistic propaganda teams and 9 libraries (with 8,000 popular books) at 17 construction sites. This laid the foundation for carrying out regular propaganda work among basic construction employees. The cultural service teams in Anshan and Fushun helped workers write many fast-paced rhymes and cartoons combined with production, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

    Experience has proved that in the basic construction sector where the work of Party and mass organizations and mass propaganda is weak, vigorously organizing and using cultural service teams to go deep into construction sites and dormitories to carry out enlightenment education and cultural entertainment is one of the powerful forms of carrying out propaganda work in the basic construction sector.

    II. Establishing a Party Propaganda Network Oriented to Production

    On the basis of the activities of the cultural service teams, a group of activists were discovered and cultivated. The Party's propaganda departments immediately established a propaganda network in the basic construction sector in accordance with the CCP Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network for the people throughout the Party. At present, there are 6,688 propagandists in the basic construction sector in Northeast China, accounting for about 4 percent of the total number of fixed employees in the basic construction sector in the region. Among them, the basic construction sector of Anshan Iron and Steel has reached 7 percent of the number of fixed workers. Propaganda networks have been established in construction sites with more than 200 people in Heilongjiang Province, and many work types and production teams have propagandists. Moreover, a considerable number of mass propaganda teams and activists are united around the propaganda network. They work with propagandists to run blackboards, draw cartoons, organize recreational activities, listen to the radio, and conduct oral and written propaganda. For example, the Anshan Basic Construction Department has 21 mass propaganda teams; the Harbin Youth League branch has successively cultivated and developed 660 propaganda activists, preparing the power for the development of propagandists.

    Secondly, in order to improve the quality of propagandists, the Anshan Basic Construction Political Department and the Construction Site Political Office have successively run four training courses for propagandists, and about 300 propagandists have been trained. The Basic Construction Political Department systematically provided various propaganda materials to coordinate with the movement, including "Workers' Political Teaching Materials" for ideological education, "Propaganda Speech Materials" to coordinate with the engineering tasks at each stage, and about a dozen types of "Construction Site Fast Rhymes" and propaganda maps for construction site mobilization. The Party General Branches and Branches of the ten largest construction sites in Heilongjiang Province held amateur training courses for propagandists in combination with current work. 447 propagandists were trained, and most propagandists were very satisfied. They felt that they had solved problems and learned skills, and they could guarantee that they would play a role in their work.

    III. Each construction site generally established a division of labor, contracting, and special responsibility system for the work of propagandists. The division of labor and contracting can be implemented in the following two situations: one is to contract the propaganda and mobilization of work numbers, production teams, and work sheds according to production and living conditions; the other is to use reading groups, radio stations, blackboards, slides, and other tools to carry out propaganda according to special expertise and skills. Some places combine these two propaganda methods, use them flexibly, and complement each other, which has a greater effect.

    In the past year, the Party's propaganda network in the basic construction sector in Northeast China has played a significant role in serving production. For example, before and after construction, it focused on publicizing the great significance of basic construction work to the country's industrialization and socialist future, reversing some incorrect understandings of some employees who did not value basic construction work, thus greatly improving the labor enthusiasm of all employees. Especially in July and August last year, in the movement to expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible and establish a responsibility system in the basic construction sector in Northeast China, the propaganda network at each construction site played a huge propaganda role and organizational role. The Party's propaganda network of the concrete engineering team of the seamless steel pipe plant construction site of Anshan Iron and Steel Company created a relatively complete set of propaganda forms from exposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible to solving the problem and establishing a responsibility system. In the movement to establish a responsibility system, more than 190 facts of no one being responsible were exposed, and the entire team carried out patriotic education to establish advanced thinking, improved the workers' class consciousness, and established 11 items of 44 articles of the responsibility system.

    In addition, propaganda network organizations have also been gradually established among the technical personnel in the basic construction sector and have played a role in their work. The propagandists of the Anshan Basic Construction Design Office were all technical personnel. In the quality make-up lesson movement, they vigorously exposed the serious losses caused by design errors due to the phenomenon of no one being responsible among the technical personnel, collected many typical examples, and held a quality make-up lesson exhibition; and used the method of detailed accounting to expose that a certain project caused design errors due to no one being responsible, which led to rework of the project, delayed production time for seven months, caused huge losses to the country, and affected the production of other related units. The reason why it was able to achieve the above achievements is because it strengthened the Party's leadership among the technical personnel, established the work of the propaganda network in the technical departments, enabled the technical personnel to conduct vivid and touching propaganda themselves, and earnestly served the production work, so that the movement to implement the responsibility system was deeply carried out in the technical departments.

    Experience has also proved that on the basis of the widespread activities of cultural service teams, it is necessary to quickly establish and develop the Party's propaganda network, and immediately orient it to production, carry out vivid propaganda aimed at the ideological problems of the masses, and gradually improve various systems for leading the work of the propaganda network and improve the level of propaganda work from propaganda activities, in order to give play to the role of the Party's propaganda network and encourage basic construction employees to overfulfill the state plan, which is not only necessary, but also completely possible.

    III. Several Effective Propaganda Forms

    Basic construction sites are very different from general factory and mine production departments. There is high-altitude work, and there is basic work dozens of meters deep underground. The open-air operation in a vast area, and the project is extremely dispersed. And propaganda work, like other political and ideological work, has its own certain forms and methods. For more than half a year, various construction sites in Northeast China have used a variety of forms and methods suitable for the characteristics of the construction site, and have made many new creations and developments. Among them, the following are more effective and popular among the masses:

    I. Establish radio stations. The radio station is one of the powerful weapons for carrying out propaganda and mobilization work. At present, major construction sites and construction site dormitories in Northeast China have generally established radio stations. According to statistics from four cities, including Anshan and Jinzhou, there are more than 60 radio stations, and more than 560 wired speakers have been installed at construction sites and dormitories. Qiqihar City has established radio stations at construction sites with more than 250 people.

    The characteristics of the radio station are to widely and timely implement the central task, and to timely commend models and promote advanced experience. The radio station can activate the work of the propaganda network and promote the Party branch to strengthen its leadership over the work of propagandists. The radio stations at each construction site are mostly working under the specific leadership of the trade union cultural and educational committee under the leadership of the Party. The branch grasps the ideological and production situation of the workers according to the propagandist's writing and various propaganda work, which is convenient for the specific leadership of the propaganda network. For example, some construction site radio stations in Heilongjiang Province have established a "radio station" for promoting advanced experience, and it is the greatest honor for employees to introduce their advanced experience to the "radio station."

    The establishment of a radio station must be carefully led, and systematic organizational work must be carried out to ensure that the broadcast work is carried out regularly. And pay attention to preventing the practice of simply broadcasting records, or merely using it as a tool for administrative notices, and losing ideological education.

    II. Hold recollection forums and use typical ideological reports to enlighten workers' class consciousness. Tian Enxi was enlightened by his class consciousness after listening to the recollections of Xie Wanfu and Yang Dezhong at the recollection meeting, and earnestly improved his work. The workers personally experienced that today's basic construction workers are the masters of the country, and today's work is for the bright future of the motherland and themselves, and for building an industrialized new China, so they are full of enthusiasm and are carrying out creative labor.

    III. Construction site exhibition stand (some construction sites call it "propaganda stand"). It is very persuasive to educate workers with typical and vivid things. In mid-September last year, Wu Xuezhong's plastering team at a construction site in Fushun City did not pay attention to security and used sawed-off wood as "scaffolding," resulting in five people being injured. The exhibition stand drew cartoons and moved the broken "scaffolding" to the exhibition. The words "The problem is here!" were written next to the saw cut, which educated many workers. The Harbin Institute of Technology construction site used charts and cartoons to publicize the importance of basic construction. Anshan and other construction sites exhibited photos of Soviet communist construction and the mechanization and factoryization of the Soviet construction industry, which were very educational and achieved great results.

    IV. Mobile blackboard newspapers and large-character slogans. The construction site has a large area, and the work is often mobile, so in addition to some fixed blackboard newspapers, mobile blackboard newspapers must also be set up. Advanced experience, new records, and model deeds should be written on it at any time and moved to the key projects and places where workers are concentrated for propaganda. The workers like to say very much: "If we do a good job and make some achievements, the mobile express will publish our deeds." The Anshan construction site wrote the slogan "A Century-Old Plan, Quality First" on a two-square-meter red canvas and hung it high on the roof beam, which could be seen one or two miles away from the construction site.

    V. Project progress indication chart. Various places generally use images and patterns as signs to indicate the project progress or a comparison chart of the efficiency of a certain project, some of which are marked with three items of "good, fast, and economical" or one of them. For example, the concrete team of the seamless steel pipe plant construction site in Anshan, in addition to the daily progress indication, also has a chart to strive for the full red flag in the entire foundation. On a large cloth board, the pattern model of the entire project foundation is drawn. After each class irrigates a foundation, it will be evaluated; if the quality is guaranteed, a red flag will be inserted on the pattern model; and all workers will be mobilized to strive for the full red flag of the entire foundation. The workers look at the progress every day and say: It is reassuring to work according to the indicators. Every worker is extremely concerned about his work achievements, and these indication charts have become propaganda materials and basis.

    At present, the Party members in basic construction in Northeast China are concentrating on activities in the winter worker training class, preparing to serve this year's large-scale economic construction.

    东北基本建设中的宣传工作
    编者按：东北区的党组织及时地注意了基本建设中的宣传工作，并获得了初步经验，这是适应国家大规模经济建设需要的正确的做法。凡有基本建设任务的党委，都应同时把基本建设的宣传工作放到首要地位，加强工人的阶级教育，宣传基本建设对国家工业化的重大意义，鼓舞工人劳动热忱。
    一九五二年东北基本建设任务比一九五一年增加了一倍。开工前后，基本建设职工中党员和团员的数量很少。在工业部系统的党与青年团脱离生产的干部只占全体职工的三千分之一；黑龙江省只占百分之零点二八，更有许多工地根本没有党、团的基层组织。因此，各级党委曾及时地采取各种措施加强基本建设部门政治工作。如鞍山钢铁公司成立了基本建设政治部，各工程公司及某些重要的工地成立了政治处；并且，在某些新成立的工程队中，建立了政治指导员制，以保证政治工作的执行和贯彻。中共哈尔滨、长春等市市委，从市委宣传部、工业部及工会、青年团等单位抽调二百余名干部、文化教员和广播员到工地工作。中共黑龙江省各级党委除从矿厂抽调一部分宣传工作干部外，并积极提拔了一些干部充实了宣传部门。东北局宣传部也派干部分别到各工区、工地和工程队去兼任一定的宣传工作职务。这就初步加强了基本建设部门中的政治工作和宣传工作。
    一、组织文化服务队深入工地
    基本建设的工地极为分散。交通不便，各工地的政治工作机构都是新成立的，工会文教部门的工作基础薄弱，党的群众宣传工作组织也不健全。这些都是一般新工地的特点。
    为了加强工地和宿舍的工人文化娱乐活动，各地党委宣传部门都组织了基本建设文化服务队。由市团委、市文教局、市文联、中苏友协、新华书店等单位组成，在工会文教部门的直接领导下，利用休息时间在工地和宿舍进行各种宣传教育工作。文化服务队的活动内容主要是：放映电影和幻灯，演出戏剧和曲艺节目，展览图书、图片（包括介绍苏联共产主义建设和职工生活、伟大祖国、先进生产经验和先进人物的画报剪贴），游艺（各种棋类、扑克、克郎球等）、教唱歌、故事晚会、游艺比赛及各种座谈会等活动。哈尔滨市基本建设文化服务队在去年七月份，共演出电影三十九场，计有“白毛女”“钢铁战士”“中国人民的胜利”等十四部影片。演出幻灯三十五场，有“苏长有和他的小组”“学习谢万福流水作业法”等七部片子。戏剧演出二十二场，其中有“不长劲的老铁锹”、“看新房”、“推广先进经验”等十七个短小精悍的节目。书报、图片流动展览和故事晚会共举办十五次，并推销了图书近三千册。参加活动的职工累计约二十三万八千余人。平均每个建筑工人在一个月当中可看五次左右电影、幻灯和戏剧。
    这种有组织的文娱活动，对于提高基本建设工人的阶级觉悟，扩大他们的政治与文化的眼界，增加各种知识，特别是改变劳动态度，提高工程质量，学习先进经验等方面，起了很大作用。大部分土木建筑工人过去是背上一箱子工具，走到哪里，就作到哪里，吃到哪里，思想保守，行动散漫。但是，经过教育后，都积极要求学习文化，提高技术，出现了许多动人的事迹。工程队一个老工人看完“大地重光”电影后，忘了腿上的病，就坚决要求回工地工作。又如木工韩志远研究创造“咬尖倒铆机”没有成功，有点灰心，但看了“高歌猛进”电影后受了感动，苦心钻研，终于创造成功，提高工作效率百分之一千七百。
    中共鞍山市委曾提出“文教工作深入到宿舍去”这样的口号。鞍山的文教工作者就到宿舍帮助工人成立了宿舍民主管理委员会，发动全宿舍工人，利用星期日的时间，修起了球场，添置体育及胡琴等文娱用品。并用了一个晚上的业余时间，垫起了七十六立方公尺的土台；露天的剧场开始活动了，演出了电影和戏剧，工人的文化生活初步活跃起来。工人要求学习文化，便组织他们到附近的夜校去学习。使宿舍面貌一新。工人们自动在宿舍写出了这样的标语：“工地是战场，宿舍是咱家，家好精神爽，战场打胜仗”。
    齐齐哈尔市的文化服务队在十七个工地，帮助建立了十三个工人文艺宣传队、九个图书馆（有通俗书籍八千册）。给在基本建设职工中开展经常性的宣传工作打下了基础。鞍山、抚顺的文化服务队帮助工人编写了许多结合生产的快板、洋片等，都极有力地鼓舞了群众的生产积极性和创造性。
    经验证明，在党与群众组织的工作和群众宣传工作基础薄弱的基本建设部门，大力组织和运用文化服务队深入工地和宿舍，进行启蒙教育和文化娱乐，是开展基本建设部门宣传工作的有力形式之一。
    二、建立党的宣传网面向生产
    在文化服务队活动的基础上，发现和培养了一批积极分子。党的宣传部门即根据中共中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，在基本建设部门建立了宣传网。目前，东北区基本建设部门已有宣传员六千六百八十八名，占全区基本建设固定职工总人数的百分之四左右。其中鞍钢基本建设部门已达到固定工人人数的百分之七。黑龙江省二百人以上的工地都建立了宣传网，许多工种和生产班、组都有了宣传员。而且在宣传网周围团结着相当数量的群众宣传队伍和积极分子。他们和宣传员在一起，办黑板报，画漫画，组织文娱活动，收听广播，进行口头与文字宣传。如鞍山基本建设部门有二十一个群众性的宣传队；哈尔滨市的青年团支部先后培养与发展了六百六十名宣传积极分子，给发展宣传员准备了力量。
    其次，为了提高宣传员的质量，鞍山基本建设政治部和工地政治处先后开办了四期宣传员训练班，受到训练的宣传员约计三百余人。基本建设政治部为配合运动，系统地供给了各种宣传材料，计有进行思想教育的“工人政治教材”、配合各阶段工程任务的“宣传讲话材料”，以及属于工地鼓动的“工地快板”、宣传地图等约十余种。黑龙江省十个最大工地的党总支和支部，结合当前工作举办了宣传员业余轮训班，有四百四十七名宣传员受到了训练，大多数宣传员感到十分满意，认为解决问题，学到了本事，保证能在工作中起作用。
    三、各工地一般都建立了宣传员工作的分工包干专责制。可以下列两种情况实行分工包干：一种是按生产、居住的情况，专包工号、生产小组和工棚子的宣传鼓动；另一种是按专门特长、技能，掌握读报组、广播站、黑板报、幻灯等工具进行宣传。有的地方把这两种宣传方式结合起来，灵活运用，互相补充，作用更大。
    一年来，东北基本建设部门中党的宣传网在为生产服务上起了显著作用。如施工前后，着重宣传了基本建设工作对国家工业化及社会主义前途的重大意义，扭转了部分职工不重视基本建设工作的某些不正确的认识，因之大大提高了全体职工的劳动热情。特别是在去年七、八月份，全东北基本建设部门在揭发无人负责现象，建立责任制的运动中，各个工地的宣传网起了巨大的宣传作用和组织作用，鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂工地混凝土工程队的党的宣传网，创造了从揭发无人负责现象到解决问题、建立责任制度的较为完整的一套宣传形式。在建立责任制运动中，共揭发了一百九十余件无人负责事实，全队进行了树立先进思想的爱国主义教育，提高了工人的阶级觉悟，共建立了十一项四十四条责任制。
    此外，在基本建设部门的技术人员中，也逐步地建立了宣传网组织，并在工作中发挥了作用。鞍山基本建设设计处的宣传员，完全是技术人员，在质量补课运动中，大力揭发了由于技术人员中无人负责现象而造成设计错误的严重损失，收集了许多典型实例，举办了质量补课展览会；并用算细账的办法，揭露了某工程由于无人负责造成设计错误，以致工程返工，延误生产时间七个月，给国家造成巨大损失，并影响了其他有关单位的生产。所以能获得上述这些成绩，是由于在技术人员中加强了党的领导，在技术部门中建立了宣传网的工作，使技术人员自己进行生动的、打动人心的宣传，认真地为生产工作服务，使贯彻责任制的运动在技术部门中深入地开展起来。
    经验又证明，在文化服务队广泛活动的基础上，迅速建立和发展党的宣传网，并立即面向生产，针对群众思想问题展开生动的宣传，从宣传活动中逐步健全领导宣传网工作的各种制度，提高宣传工作水平，以发挥党的宣传网的作用，鼓舞基本建设职工超额完成国家计划，这不仅是必须的，而且也是完全可能做到的。
    三、几种有效的宣传形式
    基本建设工地，和一般厂矿生产部门迥然不同。这里有高空作业，有在几十公尺深的地下的基础作业。在地区辽阔的露天操作，工程又极为分散。而宣传工作和其他政治思想工作一样，是有其一定的形式和方法的。半年多以来，东北各工地运用了适合工地特点的多种多样的形式和方法，并有不少新的创造和发展，其中收效较大，群众比较欢迎的，有下列几种：
    一、建立广播站。广播站是进行宣传鼓动工作的有力武器之一。目前，全东北各大工地和工地宿舍，均普遍建立了广播站。据鞍山、锦州等四个市的统计，共有广播站六十余处，并在工地及宿舍安装有线喇叭五百六十余个。齐齐哈尔市在二百五十人以上的工地，均建立起广播站。
    广播站的特点是广泛和及时地贯彻中心任务，并可以及时地表扬模范，推广先进经验。广播站可以活跃宣传网工作，推动党支部加强对宣传员工作的领导。各工地的广播站大部都是在党的领导下通过工会文教委员会具体领导进行工作的。支部根据宣传员的写稿和各种宣传工作，掌握工人思想和生产情况便于对宣传网的具体领导。如黑龙江省有些工地广播站成立了推广先进经验的“广播台”，职工以到“广播台”介绍自己的先进经验为最大的光荣。
    建立广播站必须认真领导，进行系统的组织工作，保证广播工作经常进行。并注意防止只是单纯播送唱片，或仅仅是作为行政上发通知的工具，而失掉思想教育的作法。
    二、举行回忆座谈会，通过典型思想报告，启发工人的阶级觉悟。田恩喜在回忆会上听了谢万福、杨德重的回忆，启发了自己的阶级觉悟，认真地改进了工作。工人们从亲身体验到，今天的基本建设工人，是国家的主人，今天的工作，是为了祖国和自己光明的将来，为了建设工业化的新中国，因而充满了热情，进行着创造性的劳动。
    三、工地展览台（有的工地叫“宣传台”）。用典型形象的事物来教育工人，说服力很大。去年九月中旬，抚顺市某工地吴学忠抹灰组由于不注意保安，用锯断了半面的木头当“脚手板”，结果摔伤了五个人，展览台就画成漫画，并把断了的“脚手板”也搬来展览，在锯口旁写着：“毛病在这里！”教育了很多工人。哈尔滨工业大学工地用图表、漫画来宣传基本建设的重要性。鞍山等工地，在展览台展览了苏联共产主义建设及苏联建筑业的机械化、工厂化等富有教育意义的照片，收到了很大效果。
    四、流动黑板报和大字标语。工地面积很大，同时工作也常流动，所以除了一些固定黑板报外，还必须设置流动黑板报。随时随地把先进经验、新纪录、模范事迹写在上面，经常移动到工程重点和工人集中的地方去进行宣传。工人们十分喜欢地说：“好好地干点成绩出来，流动快报就登上咱们的事迹了。”鞍山工地在两平方公尺大小的红色帆布上，写了“百年大计、质量第一”的标语高高挂在大房梁上，离工地一二里地就能看到。
    五、工程进度指示图。各地普遍用形象和图案作标志，表示工程进度或某一工程效率比较的指示图，其中有标明“好、快、省”三项或其中一项者。如鞍山无缝钢管厂工地混凝土队除了有每日进度指示外，并有争取全部基础满堂红的图表。在大幅布板上，画上了全部工程基础的图案模型，每个班浇灌完一座基础后，就进行评比；如保证了质量，就在图案模型上插一面红旗；并发动全体工人为争取全部基础满堂红而努力。工人每天瞧着进展程度说：照着指标干活心里有底。每个工人都万分关心自己的工作成绩，这些指示图又成为宣传的材料和根据。
    目前东北基本建设中的党员正集中在冬季工人训练班中活动，准备为今年的大规模经济建设服务。
