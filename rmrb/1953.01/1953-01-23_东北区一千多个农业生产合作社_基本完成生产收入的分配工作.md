    Over a Thousand Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Northeast China Basically Complete the Distribution of Production Income
    The first batch of agricultural production cooperatives trial-operated in Northeast China in 1952 have basically completed the distribution of production income. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels in Northeast China have adopted various effective measures to ensure the correct distribution by the agricultural production cooperatives.
    Of the 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives trial-operated in the Northeast region last year, all but a few severely affected by disasters produced more grain than the local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The yield per unit area of cultivated land of agricultural production cooperatives was generally 20 to 30 percent higher than that of local farmers, and in some cases, it even exceeded the yield of local farmers by more than double. The farmers praised the agricultural production cooperatives as having "good direction, strong organization, great ability, and high output."
    Nevertheless, there were still many problems in the distribution of agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Northeast China. These were mainly: some agricultural production cooperatives excessively emphasized the accumulation of public property, blindly setting up stalls, adding carts and horses, and opening oil mills, flour mills, blacksmith shops, shoe shops, tailor shops, and engaging in large-scale construction, building communal kitchens, offices, guest houses, warehouses, nurseries, etc., so that the accumulation of public property of agricultural production cooperatives exceeded 50 percent of their total income. Secondly, many agricultural production cooperatives lacked qualified accountants and sound accounting systems, and the accounts were not clearly settled, which also hindered the smooth progress of distribution.
    In order to solve the problem of "more grain produced, less grain distributed" that occurred in agricultural production cooperatives, the Party and government leading organs in various parts of Northeast China promptly selected a group of capable cadres and accounting personnel to help the agricultural production cooperatives correct the tendency of a few activists to demand excessive accumulation of public property. Agricultural production cooperatives that had already accumulated a large amount of public property, in addition to setting aside seeds and feed for this year with the consent of the members, no longer retained excessive grain for purposes such as adding carts and horses and building new houses. Agricultural production cooperatives whose accumulation of public property exceeded 5 percent of their total income last year did not retain or retained less public accumulation funds and cancelled various unnecessary public accumulation projects. They also helped the agricultural production cooperatives to settle their accounts. Some cooperatives also convened member congresses to revise items whose income and expenditure were not clear enough. Public and private accounts were clarified, and the "obligatory work" and meal expenses that should be borne by the members themselves were changed to be borne by the members themselves, reducing unnecessary public expenditures. When settling accounts, special attention was paid to the calculation of "workdays" to make them as accurate and fair as possible. For example, after discussion by all members, the Han'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, gave four members who cut more and better-quality bulrush grass in sideline production an additional five to ten "workdays" each. Regarding the debts owed by the agricultural production cooperatives to the State Bank and other parties for the purchase of public property, they negotiated with the relevant economic departments to implement repayment in installments based on the economic strength of the agricultural production cooperatives. The ten agricultural production cooperatives in Liaozhong County, Liaoxi Province, repaid the loans for seeds, feed, and pesticides, while the large loans for carts and horses were repaid in installments, and the income of the general members exceeded that of the mutual aid teams. The distribution ratio of land, carts, horses, and labor was generally not changed, and only a few agricultural production cooperatives that were very unreasonable made necessary corrections after discussion by all members.
    After the agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Northeast China carried out the distribution in accordance with the above situation, the income of the general members exceeded that of the local individual farmers and mutual aid team members, so their production enthusiasm was very high. Now, the agricultural production cooperatives in various places are summarizing their work and formulating production plans for this year to increase production and increase income.

    东北区一千多个农业生产合作社  基本完成生产收入的分配工作
    东北区一九五二年第一批试办的农业生产合作社，已经基本上完成了生产收入的分配工作。中共中央东北局和中共东北各级党的组织和人民政府曾采取各种有效措施，保证农业生产合作社作到了正确的分配。
    去年东北全区试办的一千二百个农业生产合作社，除个别受重灾者外，都比当地互助组和个体农民多打了粮食。农业生产合作社的耕地单位面积产量，一般比当地农民产量高百分之二十到三十，有的甚至超过了当地农民产量的一倍以上。农民都称赞农业生产合作社“方向好、组织强、本事大、产量高”。
    虽然如此，东北各地农业生产合作社在分配中，还有许多问题。这主要是：有些农业生产合作社过多地强调积累公共财产，盲目地摆设摊子，添车买马，开办油坊、磨坊、铁匠炉、鞋铺、裁缝铺和大兴土木，修盖大伙房、办公室、招待所、仓库、托儿所等，使农业生产合作社公共财产的积累，竟有超过其总收入的百分之五十以上的。其次，许多农业生产合作社由于没有称职的会计和健全的会计制度，账目结算不清，也妨碍着分配的顺利进行。
    为了解决农业生产合作社发生的“打粮多、分粮少”的问题，东北各地党政领导机关及时地选派了
    一批得力干部和会计人员，帮助各农业生产合作社纠正了少数积极分子要求过多地积累公共财产的偏向。已经积累了大量公共财产的农业生产合作社，除了在社员同意下留出今年用的种籽、饲料外，不再过多地保留添买车马、盖新房子等用途的粮食。去年一年积累公共财产超过总收入百分之五以上的农业生产合作社，不留或少留公积金，并取消了各种不必要的公共积累性质的项目。他们并帮助农业生产合作社结清了账目。有些社还召开了社员大会，对收入、支出不够清楚的项目做了订正。账上公私分清，应归社员自己负担的“义务工”、饭费均改由社员个人负担，减少不应有的公共开支。结算账目时，特别对“劳动日”的计算，尽量做到准确和公平合理。如吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社经全体社员评议，给在割靰?草的副业生产中割的数量多质量好的四名社员，分别增补了五个到十个“劳动日”。对农业生产合作社因购买公共财产而欠下国家银行等方面的债务，根据农业生产合作社的经济力量，与有关经济部门协商，实行分期偿还。辽西省辽中县十个农业生产合作社除还了种籽、饲料和农药的贷款外，大宗车马贷款则分期付还，一般社员收入都超过了互助组。对土地、车马和劳动力的分配比例一般地不予改变，只有少数农业生产合作社十分不合理的，经过全体社员讨论，才做了必要的修正。
    东北各地农业生产合作社在按上述情形进行分配后，一般社员收入都超过了当地个体农民和互助组组员，因而生产热情很高涨。现在各地农业生产合作社正在总结工作，制订今年提高生产，增加收入的生产计划。    　（新华社）
