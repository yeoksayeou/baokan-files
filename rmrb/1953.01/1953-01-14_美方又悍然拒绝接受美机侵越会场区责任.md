Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th: The US side is increasingly blatantly attempting to completely tear up the remaining agreements on the Conference Area and Neutral Zone. In a letter to our side on January 11, the US Chief Liaison Officer Calkins unreasonably refused to accept responsibility for the incident of US aircraft intruding into the Conference Area on January 4. Calkins called this violation of the agreement by the US side a "trivial" matter, using the excuse of "harmless incidents of unintentional overflight" to shirk responsibility for the series of US aircraft intrusion incidents caused by the US side. But the fact is: on January 4, the weather was very clear, and the red markers in the Conference Area were very clear. However, the US military aircraft intentionally used the security guarantee of the Conference Area, flying low between the balloons marking the Conference Area twice, and bombed and strafed our positions near the Conference Area. Calkins' attempt to describe these overflights as "harmless" cannot deceive anyone. On August 22, 1951, US aircraft intruded into the Neutral Zone, bombing and strafing the residences of our negotiating delegation, and on October 12, US aircraft again intruded into the airspace of the Neutral Zone and strafed with machine guns, killing one child. On January 17, 1952, US aircraft intruded into the Neutral Zone and dropped a 1,000-pound bomb. For these incidents of bombing and strafing the Neutral Zone, the US side also used the excuses of "shortcomings in navigation" and "negligence" of the pilots to cover up its sinister intentions to undermine the agreement.

Observers here pointed out: The agreement clearly stipulates that all armed forces of both sides, including the army, navy, and air force, shall not engage in any hostile acts in the Conference Area and the Neutral Zone. Moreover, since the resumption of the armistice talks on October 25, 1951, the US side has had to admit that US aircraft have violated the agreement by intruding into the Conference Area on fifteen occasions. For these same incidents, the US side has repeatedly expressed "regret" and stated that "measures have been taken to prevent such incidents from happening again." Now, Calkins actually claims that he is "not prepared to accept" responsibility for the same overflight incidents. This blatant act of the US side to overturn the agreement is clearly part of its entire plan to completely undermine the negotiations. Since the United Nations General Assembly passed an illegal resolution approving and encouraging the US to refuse negotiations and expand the war, the incidents of undermining the agreement created by the US side have significantly increased, reaching as many as ten times. The world should pay serious attention to this adventurous action by the US side.

### 美方又悍然拒绝接受美机侵越会场区责任

    美方又悍然拒绝接受美机侵越会场区责任
    【新华社开城十三日电】美方越来越露骨地企图彻底撕毁仅存的会场区和中立区协议。美方首席联络官卡洛克在一月十一日致函我方，蛮横地拒绝接受一月四日美机侵越会场区事件的责任。卡洛克把美方这一违反协议的行为称为“琐屑”事情，以“无意飞越的无害事件”的借口，来推卸美方所制造的一系列美机侵越事件的责任。但是事实是：一月四日当天，天气非常晴朗，会场区红色标志十分清楚，而美方军用飞机有意利用会场区的安全保障，两次在作为会场区标志的气球之间低飞而过，对会场区附近我方阵地进行轰炸扫射。卡洛克企图把这些飞越事件说成是“无害”的，这也是骗不了任何人的。一九五一年八月二十二日，美机侵入中立区，轰炸和扫射我方谈判代表团住所，十月十二日美机又侵入中立区上空以机枪扫射，打死小孩一名。一九五二年一月十七日美机侵入中立区投掷一千磅炸弹一枚。对这些轰炸扫射中立区的事件，美方也曾以驾驶员“在航行中的缺点”和“疏忽”为借口，来掩饰其破坏协议的罪恶意图。
    此间观察家指出：双方协议明白规定：双方一切武装力量，包括陆海空军在内，在会场区和中立区内不得进行任何敌对行为。而且自一九五一年十月二十五日停战谈判会议复会以来，美方曾不得不承认美机违反协议侵越会场区的事件达十五次。对这些同样的事件，美方曾一再表示“遗憾”，并且声言“已采取措施以免此类事件再度发生”。而现在，卡洛克竟声称“不准备接受”同样的这些飞越事件的责任。美方这种公然推翻协议的行为，显然是其彻底破坏谈判的整个计划中的一部分。自联合国大会通过批准和鼓励美方拒绝谈判、扩大战争的非法决议案以来，美方制造的破坏协议事件显见增加，至今已达十次之多。全世界对美方的这种冒险行动，应引起严重的注意。
