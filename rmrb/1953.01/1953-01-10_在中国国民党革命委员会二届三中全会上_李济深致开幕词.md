Comrades:

    The Second Plenary Session (Enlarged Meeting) of the Third Central Committee of our party is now open. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, I extend a welcome to the comrades who are participating in the conference, especially those who have come from afar.

    Our conference is being held at the beginning of a new year, a year of great historical significance for our country, a year in which large-scale construction begins. The comrades participating in the conference range from members of the Central Committee to representatives of grassroots organizations, and they have broad representation within the party. Here, we will summarize the experiences and lessons of the past, and decide on the future work guidelines, so that our party can fully shoulder the responsibilities assigned to us in the division of labor of the people's democratic united front, in the construction cause of our motherland marching towards an infinitely bright future. This fills us with boundless excitement, and at the same time, it illustrates the great significance of our conference!

    It has been exactly two years since the Second Plenary Session. During these two years, the great people of our motherland, under the glorious banner of Mao Zedong, have continuously moved from victory to victory. When the Second Plenary Session was convened, it was precisely when the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, occupied our Taiwan, and directed the spearhead of aggression at our Northeast. Hundreds of thousands of our most outstanding sons and daughters responded to the great call to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, organized the Chinese People's Volunteers, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Korean people. Over the past two years, our People's Volunteers have fully demonstrated the lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism, fully demonstrated the industrious and courageous qualities of our nation, fully demonstrated the high wisdom of the masses, and overcome all unimaginable difficulties, constantly giving the US invading forces heavy blows. They defeated their army equipped with all kinds of new weapons, and defeated their inhumane germ warfare. As of now, the US imperialists have paid the price of more than 300,000 casualties in direct combat, and spent more than 20 billion US dollars in war expenses. The result is: we are getting stronger and stronger in the war, while the enemy is sinking deeper and deeper, unable to extricate themselves. Comrades! We must fully recognize the enormous impact of the Korean battlefield on the world situation. Our struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea has not only defended the security of our country, but also disrupted the US imperialists' plan to launch a third world war, increased the contradictions within the imperialist aggressive camp itself, and greatly encouraged the oppressed nations and people all over the world, enhancing their determination and confidence to fight for democracy, freedom, and national independence. This has made a great contribution to the world peace movement. Of course, a small group of monopoly capitalists on Wall Street in the United States will not give up on this. They need war, they need to maintain a tense situation, in order to continue to adopt the method of militarizing the national economy to ensure their maximum capitalist profits. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to understand why the US imperialists used all kinds of shameless tricks on the issue of repatriating prisoners of war, as an excuse to disrupt the armistice negotiations in order to achieve their conspiracy to continue and expand the Korean War. Precisely because of this, we must continue to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, call on the people of the whole country to strengthen their support for the People's Volunteers, strive for new and greater victories, and continue to strive for a just and reasonable peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

    While supporting the People's Volunteers in their victorious battles in Korea, we have also achieved brilliant victories in all construction and social reform movements in our country over the past two years. In areas with more than 420 million agricultural population, land reform has been completed, and the feudal system has been eliminated. Through the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, on the one hand, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces of the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang were given a devastating blow, and on the other hand, the broad masses of people were given effective political education and class education, which improved the consciousness and organization of the broad masses of people, and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship. Through the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the movement to increase production and practice economy, the social atmosphere has been changed, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have been eliminated, and the "five poisons" of the bourgeoisie that are harmful to the country have been eliminated. This has fundamentally improved our country's financial and economic situation, and laid the foundation for the smooth implementation of large-scale construction. The victories of these movements have prepared sufficient conditions for convening the National People's Congress this year.

    Over the past two years, new things that the Chinese people have dreamed of for many generations have become living realities and are placed before us: the Huai River Harnessing Project, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway and other magnificent projects. Our millions of working people, with the attitude of masters, have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and created unprecedented miracles. Production in various sectors has been restored to and, in major products, exceeded the highest levels before the Anti-Japanese War. Under the call to increase production and practice economy, the working masses have organized competitions, found shortcuts, and put forward rationalization proposals, and a large number of outstanding labor heroes and model workers have emerged. On the basis of the rapid development of the national economy, the people's lives have generally improved, purchasing power has continuously increased, the market has become increasingly active, and the leading position of the state-owned economy has become more and more consolidated. Prices are stable, the currency is stable, and the market is stable. This has created good conditions for the country to enter large-scale construction. The state's financial revenue and expenditure have therefore achieved a balance and even a surplus. Under Chairman Mao's great national policy, the economic and cultural lives of all fraternal ethnic groups in the country have been greatly improved, and an unprecedented situation of mutual unity has emerged. Through the resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea and various revolutionary movements, the people's patriotic spirit has been greatly enhanced. Intellectuals, after ideological remolding, have generally gradually overcome the shortcomings brought about by the old society and their class origins, and have changed their original appearance. The movement to eliminate illiteracy is being carried out throughout the country. As pointed out by Chairman Mao: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." This has become the current reality.

    It should be pointed out that the great achievements our country has made in such a short period of three or two years are inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance given to us by the great Soviet Union. Chairman Mao told us: "As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite with international friends, we will always be victorious." Due to the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, due to the increasing consolidation and strength of the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, due to the close unity of 800 million people in socialist and new democratic countries, and even more due to the unremitting struggle of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world who stand with us to defend world peace, the forces of peace will surely be able to crush the conspiracy of war provocateurs.

    Comrades! The great achievements our country has made should first of all be attributed to the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. We would like to extend our warm and high respects to our great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party!

    Comrades! The great achievements our country has made should be attributed to our most beloved people - the Chinese People's Volunteers. They defended the motherland and defended peace with their most precious flesh and blood, so that our country can victoriously carry out all construction. We would like to extend our warm and high respects to all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    Comrades! The great achievements our country has made should be attributed to the working people of our country, who have won great victories on the production front, thus effectively supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers, consolidating the national defense of the motherland, and laying the foundation for our country to enter large-scale construction. Their unparalleled selfless labor enthusiasm should serve as an example for our work. We would like to extend our warm and high respects to them, especially to the thousands of labor heroes and model workers!

    Comrades! The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We have fully realized from practice the correct lesson of Sun Yat-sen's "taking Russia as a teacher." We must strengthen our study of the Soviet Union, and constantly consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union. We thank the Soviet Union for all the great assistance it has given us. We would like to extend our warm and high respects to the great peace standard-bearer - the mentor of progressive mankind all over the world and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Stalin!

    Comrades! Now let me talk about the situation of our party in the past two years: First of all, we should affirm that our party has made achievements in the past two years, and the achievements are the main ones. Our achievements are manifested in: The party's organization has greatly developed and consolidated in the past two years. In the past two years, the number of our party members has increased more than two and a half times compared with the Second Plenary Session. Through the three major movements and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the party members have been tested and tempered. Through the study of cadres and the study of the Common Program, and through the work practice in state organs and other work positions, they have recognized many new things, thus changing their thoughts and feelings, and developing infinite love for the people's motherland. Therefore, they have greatly improved their ideological understanding. Because the party firmly stood on the side of the people in various revolutionary movements, eliminated the counter-revolutionary elements who had infiltrated the party, and constantly carried out resolute struggles against the phenomena of losing position, violating discipline, and harming the interests of the people; at the same time, it absorbed a large number of progressive activists who emerged in various revolutionary movements, work, and study to join our party, and many Communist Party members and Youth League members joined the party, injecting fresh blood into our party, and initially establishing the backbone of the party. This provides a strong guarantee for the soundness and consolidation of the party. We know that the development of the party's quantity will inevitably strengthen the party's ties with all sectors of society and expand the party's influence on society, which is in line with the requirements of our united front task. The improvement of the party's quality will inevitably enable all members to play an active role in their work posts and provide strength for the great construction cause of the people's motherland, which is in line with the requirements of our political tasks. Facts have proved that in the past two years, under the leadership of the party and state organs, and under the impetus of various great movements, many comrades in various departments have given play to their work enthusiasm and creativity, and have played a leading and exemplary role. The representatives of grassroots organizations who are participating in the conference today are comrades who have been selected from these many activists. Although this is only a good start, if we can constantly give full play to the past advantages, promote these successful experiences, and constantly improve on the existing basis, we will be able to better complete our tasks.

    The reason why our party has been able to achieve these major achievements should first of all be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great support and help it has given us in specific work. Secondly, it should be admitted that the policies and guidelines decided by the party since the Second Plenary Session are correct. Finally, we should thank the responsible comrades of the organizations at all levels and the hard work of all party members. If we do not have these conditions, our party would not have been able to achieve these achievements.

    However, I want to remind everyone that our past achievements do not give us reason to be complacent. We should admit that the development of our party today is still far behind the requirements of the objective situation. The reason is that our party still has many shortcomings. Although our shortcomings are shortcomings in progress and victory, and these shortcomings can be completely overcome as long as we resolutely rely on the guidance of the leading party and resolutely rely on the supervision and criticism of party members and the masses. But we must not think that it is insignificant because of this. On the contrary, we must adopt an extremely serious attitude to deal with this issue. We must constantly wage resolute struggles against these shortcomings. We must learn the method of criticism and self-criticism, and constantly use this powerful weapon to carry out struggles in a principled manner, so as to effectively eliminate the obstacles in our path forward and ensure the healthy development of the party. In this conference, it is hoped that the comrades will adhere to this principle in a spirit of seeking truth from facts to discuss and solve problems.

    In this conference, our most important requirement is to achieve a unified understanding of the party's nature, tasks, policies, and guidelines, and then to determine relatively specific and practical basic principles in implementing the party's tasks and implementing the party's policies and guidelines. Here I am prepared to offer some opinions as a reference for comrades to discuss the issues.

    Our party is a new democratic political party and one of the members of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. The tasks of our organization are determined by the division of labor of the united front and determined by objective needs. In a new democratic society, each democratic party, according to its political history and the characteristics of its party, is entrusted with the responsibility of contacting certain social strata and certain specific objects of each stratum, striving to unite them, organize them, educate and transform them in accordance with the Common Program, and continuously expand the team and consolidate the team through organizational relations, so that it can become an organized and disciplined strong force, so as to complete the construction of new democracy under the leadership of the working class and move towards the socialist future. Specifically, for our party, according to the party's history and characteristics, it is determined that the objects we must unite and educate are mainly people who have had direct or indirect relations with the Kuomintang in the past. Therefore, the organizational line decided by the party is completely correct. Of course, in order to shoulder this heavy task, we must first absorb a large number of progressive activists as the backbone of the party, so as to enrich the leadership of the party, so as to play a role in helping, educating, and leading the general party members and the masses. Today, due to the impetus of the objective situation, many people who have historical relations with the original Kuomintang have a certain degree of political awareness and begin to actively demand to participate in the organization, demand to live an organizational life, and demand to obtain the help of the party organization and comrades in work and study. This is enough to show that the party has the necessity and the responsibility to closely contact them, unite them, educate them, and absorb those who have a clear political outlook, a high political awareness, and are willing to accept the Common Program and strive for it into the organization. Through the help of the party, constantly improve their ideological understanding, encourage their work enthusiasm and creativity, so as to play a better role in the country's various construction undertakings. Therefore, the party must be good at cultivating and using the backbone, improve the leadership, enrich the grassroots organizational life, so that it can play the role of mutual education and mutual help, and constantly improve the quality of party members. Only in this way can it be possible to constantly develop the party's organization and expand the party's influence.

    The party's leadership and assistance to party members should focus on political education and ideological education. We all come from the old society. Although the degree of infection by the old society is not necessarily the same, we are limited by our class origins and lack revolutionary practice. Therefore, our self-ideological remolding has become a regular, long-term, and arduous task. Today, in our party, strictly distinguishing the enemy from ourselves should still be placed in the primary position of ideological education. We must always be vigilant, guard against hidden enemies, and never allow an enemy that harms the people's motherland to take advantage of our loopholes. In terms of personal thoughts, we must always check our thoughts and feelings, check our lifestyle, check the potential incorrect ideological consciousness, strictly demand ourselves, and constantly improve ourselves from practical work, revolutionary practice, and theoretical study. At the same time, with an active and well-intentioned attitude, help comrades and make progress together, so as to strengthen the unity of the party and better play the organizational strength of the party.

    What I have said above is the central issue to be studied and discussed at this conference. In order for the conference to focus on solving these basic problems, our specific arrangements are to concentrate on discussing these issues at the conference. Its contents: broadly speaking, it is: the issue of the party's basic tasks, and the issue of how the party should carry out its work under the three major tasks of the country continuing to strengthen resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, starting large-scale construction, and convening the National People's Congress. The conference requires that a unified understanding be sought on these issues first. Only on the basis of a unified understanding of thought can we lay a good foundation for implementing the party's basic policies and guidelines in the future. Therefore, at this conference, we hope to discuss around the report submitted to the conference by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee. As for some specific work issues, we plan to continue to study them after the closing of the conference by the members of the Central Committee and the comrades responsible for local organizations, and organize business seminars to solve them appropriately according to the policies and guidelines decided by the conference and according to the actual situation and conditions of the party.

    In the long process of the Chinese revolution, our mentor Sun Yat-sen was the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution. In his lifelong great revolutionary cause, he left us with a rich legacy and a glorious example. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communist Party enriched and developed Mr. Sun's thought with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and pointed out the great future of the Chinese revolution moving from new democracy to socialism and communism. Many comrades in our party have continued Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, participated in the struggle of the people's revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and contributed their strength. Today, due to the development of the national situation, the tasks of our party are becoming heavier day by day. We cheer for the great achievements of our motherland in the past three years. Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our motherland is invincible. We must intensify our efforts, and we must strive to always be a strong helper of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class on the way to the infinitely bright future of our motherland. We will contribute everything to the great construction cause of the people's motherland with infinite loyalty.

    I wish the conference a success!
    I wish comrades health and progress!

    在中国国民党革命委员会二届三中全会上
    李济深致开幕词同志们：
    本党二届三中全会（扩大会议）现在开幕了。我代表中央常务委员会对参加大会的同志们，特别是由各地远道而来的同志们表示欢迎。
    我们这一次大会，是在我们国家具有伟大历史意义的、开始大规模建设的一年新年来举行的；而参加大会的同志，是从中央委员一直到基层组织的代表，在党内具有广泛的代表性。在这里，我们来总结过去的经验教训，决定未来的工作方针，使我们的党在祖国走向无限美好前程的建设事业当中，能够圆满地担负我们在人民民主统一战线分工上应负的任务，这使我们感觉到无限的兴奋，同时也就说明了我们的大会具有何等重大的意义！
    从二中全会到今天，已经整整的两年。这两年间，我们伟大的祖国人民，在光辉的毛泽东旗帜之下，不断从胜利走向胜利。当二中全会开会的时候，正是美帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，侵占了我们的台湾，把侵略的矛头指向我们的东北。我们成千成万最优秀的儿女，响应了抗美援朝、保家卫国的伟大号召，组织了中国人民志愿军，和英雄的朝鲜人民，并肩作战。这两年来我们人民志愿军充分发挥了崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，充分发挥了我们民族勤劳勇敢的特质，充分发挥了群众高度的智慧，克服了一切不可想像的困难，不断给美国侵略军以沉重的打击。打败了他们以一切新式武器装备起来的军队，打败了他们灭绝人性的细菌战。截至目前为止，美帝国主义者已经付出三十多万兵员的直接战斗的伤亡，付出二百多亿美元的战费，结果是：我们愈战愈强，敌人则愈陷愈深难于自拔。同志们！我们要充分认识朝鲜战场对于世界局势的巨大影响。我们抗美援朝的斗争，不仅保卫了我们国家的安全，同时打乱了美帝国主义者发动第三次世界大战的计划，增加了帝国主义侵略阵营本身的矛盾，给全世界被压迫的民族和人民以极大的鼓舞，提高了他们为争取民主自由与民族独立而斗争的决心和信心，这就对于世界和平运动有了极伟大的贡献。当然，美国华尔街的一小撮垄断资本家是不肯从此罢手的，他们需要战争，需要保持紧张的局势，用以继续采取国民经济军事化的办法，来保证他们最大限度的资本主义利润。因此，我们就不难明白，为什么美帝国主义要在遣返战俘问题上用尽了一切无耻的伎俩，作为破坏停战谈判的藉口来达到他们继续和扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。也正因为这样，我们就必须继续加强抗美援朝运动，号召全国人民加强对于人民志愿军的支援，争取新的更大的胜利，同时继续争取朝鲜问题的公正合理的和平解决。
    在支援人民志愿军在朝鲜胜利作战的同时，这两年来，我们国内在一切建设和社会改革运动上也取得了辉煌的胜利。四亿二千多万的农业人口地区，已经完成了土地改革，消灭了封建制度。经过了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，一方面给了帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮残留下来的反革命势力以毁灭性的打击，一方面给了广大人民群众以有效的政治教育和阶级教育，提高了广大人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，巩固了人民民主专政。经过了“三反”“五反”和增产节约运动，改变了社会风气，贪污、浪费和官僚主义被肃清了，资产阶级中对国家有害的
    “五毒”被肃清了，这就使我国财政经济状况根本好转，并且奠定了顺利进行大规模建设的基础。由于这些运动的胜利，就为今年召开全国人民代表大会，准备了足够的条件。
    这两年来，中国人民许多世代以来梦寐以求的新事物，已经成为活生生的现实，摆在我们的面前：治淮工程，荆江分洪工程和成渝铁路、天兰铁路等等宏伟的工程，我们千百万的劳动人民，以主人翁的姿态发挥高度的劳动热情，创造了有史以来所未有的奇迹。在各种生产部门中都已经恢复到并在主要生产品上超过了抗日战争以前的最高水平。劳动群众在增产节约号召之下，纷纷组织竞赛、找窍门、提合理化建议，涌现了大批杰出的劳动英雄和劳动模范。在国民经济迅速发展的基础上，人民的生活一般获得改善，购买力不断提高，市场日趋活跃，国营经济的领导地位一天比一天巩固。物价稳定，币值稳定，市场稳定，这样就为国家进入大规模建设创造了良好的条件。国家财政收支因此就达到了平衡而且还有节余。在毛主席伟大的民族政策之下，国内各兄弟民族的经济和文化生活获得极大的改进，出现了空前未有的互相团结的局面。通过抗美援朝和各项革命运动，人民的爱国精神大大的提高。知识分子经过了思想改造，一般已经逐渐克服了从旧社会、从其阶级出身所带来的缺点，改变了原来的面貌。扫除文盲运动正在全国范围内开展起来。正如毛主席所指出的：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”。这已经成为当前的现实了。
    应该指出，我们国家在这样短短的三两年间，能够获得这样伟大的成就，和伟大的苏联给予我们兄弟般的无私的援助是不可分的。毛主席告诉我们：“只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的”。由于中苏两大国牢不可破的友谊，由于以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的日益巩固和强大，由于社会主义和新民主主义国家八亿人民的紧密团结，更由于全世界爱好和平的亿万人民和我们站在一起为保卫世界和平而进行不懈的斗争，和平的力量一定可以粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋。
    同志们！我们国家之所以获得这样伟大的成就，首先应该归功于毛主席和中国共产党英明、正确的领导。我们谨向我们伟大的领袖毛主席和中国共产党致以热烈崇高的敬礼！
    同志们！我们国家之所以获得这样伟大的成就，应该归功于我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。他们以最宝贵的血肉，保卫了祖国，保卫了和平，我们的国家才有可能胜利地进行一切的建设。我们谨向中国人民志愿军全体同志们致以热烈崇高的敬礼！
    同志们！我们国家之所以获得这样伟大的成就，应该归功于我们全国的劳动人民，他们在生产战线上打了很大的胜仗，因而有效地支援了中国人民志愿军，巩固了祖国的国防，奠定了我们国家进入大规模建设的基础。他们无比的忘我的劳动热情，应该作为我们工作的榜样。我们谨向他们，特别是千千万万的劳动英雄和劳动模范们致以热烈崇高的敬礼！
    同志们！苏联的今天，就是我们的明天，我们已经从实践中充分体认到孙中山先生“以俄为师”的正确教训。我们要加强对苏联的学习，要不断巩固和发展中苏两大国牢不可破的友谊，我们感谢苏联给我们的一切伟大的援助。我们谨向伟大的和平旗手——全世界进步人类的导师、中国人民最亲密的朋友斯大林致以热烈崇高的敬礼！
    同志们！现在让我来谈谈两年来我们党的情况：首先，我们应该肯定，这两年来我们的党是有成绩的，而且成绩是主要的。我们的成绩，表现于：党的组织两年来有了很大的发展，也大大的巩固了。两年来我们党员的人数，比较二中全会时增加了两倍半以上，党员同志通过了三大运动和“三反”“五反”运动的考验和锻炼，通过了整干学习和共同纲领的学习，通过在国家机关和其他工作岗位的工作实践，认识了许多新鲜事物，从而改变了思想感情，对人民祖国发生无限的热爱，因而在思想认识上大大提高了一步。由于党在各种革命运动中，坚决的站在人民的立场，清除了混入党内的反革命分子，并对丧失立场、违反纪律、损害人民利益的现象，不断地进行了坚决的斗争；同时吸收了在各种革命运动中、工作中、学习中涌现出来大批进步积极分子参加我们的党，还有不少共产党员、青年团员交叉入党，给我们党注入新鲜的血液，初步树立了党的骨干，这就为党的健全和巩固，提供了有力的保证。我们知道，党的数量的发展，就必然会加强了党与社会各阶层的联系，扩大了党对社会的影响，这是符合于我们统战任务要求的。党的质量的提高，各个成员就必然在其工作岗位上起了积极的作用，为人民祖国的伟大建设事业提供了力量，这是符合于我们政治任务要求的。事实证明，两年来我们党在领导党和国家机关的领导、推动之下，在各种伟大运动中，在各部门工作中，不少同志发挥了工作的积极性、创造性，起了带头作用和模范作用，今天参加大会的基层组织代表，就是从这许多积极分子中推选出来的同志。虽然这仅仅是一个良好开端，但如果在全党范围内，我们能够不断地充分发挥过去的优点，推广这些成功的经验，在现有的基础上不断地提高，我们就能够更好地完成我们的任务。
    我们党所以能够获得这些主要的成绩，首先就应该归功于中国共产党正确的领导以及它在具体工作中给予我们极大的支持和帮助。其次，应该承认，从二中全会以来，党所决定的方针政策是正确的。最后我们应该感谢各级组织的负责同志以及全党同志的辛勤努力。如果我们不具备这些条件，我们党是不可能得到这些成就的。
    但是，我要提醒各位，我们过去的成绩，并没有值得我们自满的理由。我们应该承认，今天我们党的发展，还远远落后于客观形势的要求，原因是我们党还存在不少缺点。虽然我们的缺点都是前进中的、胜利中的缺点，而且这些缺点，只要我们坚决依靠领导党的指导，坚决依靠党员群众的监督和批评，是完全可以克服的。可是我们决不能因为这样，就认为无足轻重了，相反地，我们必须采取极端严肃认真的态度来对待这一问题。我们必须经常地向这些缺点作坚决的斗争，我们必须学会批评与自我批评的方法，并经常地运用这一有力的武器有原则地来进行斗争，以便有效地肃清横在我们前进道路中的障碍，保证党的健康发展。在这一次大会当中，就希望同志们以实事求是的精神，坚持这一条原则，来讨论问题，解决问题。
    在这一次大会中，我们最主要的要求，就是在党的性质任务、政策方针上取得一致的认识，进而在遂行党的任务、贯彻党的政策方针上确定比较具体而又切合实际的基本原则。在这里我准备提供一点意见作为同志们讨论问题的参考。
    我们的党是新民主主义的政党，是中国人民民主统一战线成员之一，我们组织的任务决定于统一战线的分工，决定于客观的需要。在新民主主义社会中，各民主党派各依据其政治历史，依据其党的特点，赋予其联系一定的社会阶层和各个阶层的某些特定对象的责任，争取团结他们，组织他们，以共同纲领为准则，进行教育和改造，并通过组织关系，不断扩大队伍，巩固队伍，使能成为有组织、有纪律的坚强力量，以便于在工人阶级领导之下，完成新民主主义的建设，走向社会主义的前途。具体到本党来说，根据党的历史和特点，就决定了我们所必须团结教育的对象，主要还是过去曾经和国民党有过直接间接关系的人们，因此，党所决定的组织路线是完全正确的。当然为了担负起我们这一繁重的任务，首先就必须吸收大量进步积极分子，作为党的骨干，以便充实党的领导，以便在一般党员群众中起帮助、教育和带动的作用。今天由于客观形势的推动，许多与原来国民党有历史关系的人士，政治觉悟有了一定的提高，开始主动地要求参加组织，要求过组织生活，要求在工作中、学习中能够取得党的组织和同志们的帮助，这就足够说明党有必要也有责任密切地联系他们，团结他们，教育他们，并将其中政治面貌清楚、政治觉悟较高、愿意接受共同纲领而为其奋斗的人士，吸收到组织中来，通过党的帮助，不断提高他们的思想认识，鼓舞他们工作的积极性和创造性，以便对国家各项建设事业起更好的作用。所以党就必须善于培养、使用骨干，健全领导，充实基层组织生活，使能发挥相互教育、相互帮助的作用，不断提高党员的质量，这样也才有可能不断发展党的组织，扩大党的影响。
    党对党员的领导和帮助，应该以政治教育、思想教育为主。我们都是来自旧社会，虽然受旧社会感染的程度不一定相同，但由于我们受了阶级出身的限制，又缺乏革命的实践，因而我们的自我思想改造就成为经常的、长期的、艰巨的工作。今天在本党来说，严格划分敌我界限，还应该放在思想教育的首要地位。我们必须经常提高警惕，谨防隐藏的敌人，绝不容许一个危害人民祖国的敌人能够钻我们的空子。而在个人思想方面，我们还必须经常检查自己的思想感情，检查自己的生活作风，检查潜在的不正确的思想意识，严格地要求自己，不断地从实际工作中、革命实践中、理论学习中来提高自己。同时以积极的、善意的态度，帮助同志，一道进步，用以加强党的团结，更好地发挥党的组织力量。
    以上所说的，也就是这一次大会研究讨论的中心问题。为了大会能够集中解决这一些基本问题，所以我们具体的布置，准备在大会中只是集中讨论这些问题。它的内容：概括的说就是：党的基本任务问题，和党在当前国家继续加强抗美援朝、开始大规模建设和召集全国人民代表大会的三大任务之下如何进行工作的问题。大会要求，在这些问题上首先求得一致的认识。只有在思想认识一致的基础上来确定党的基本政策方针，才能够为今后贯彻党的政策方针打好基础。因此，我们这一次大会，希望围绕着中央常务委员会向大会提出的报告，来进行讨论。至于有关某些具体工作问题，则准备大会闭幕之后，由中央委员和各地方组织负责的同志，组织业务座谈会来继续研究，根据大会决定的政策方针，根据党的实际情况和条件，加以适当的解决。
    在中国革命的长期过程中，我们的导师孙中山先生是伟大的中国革命的先行者，在他毕生的伟大革命事业中，留给我们以丰富的遗产和光辉的榜样。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党用马列主义的理论，丰富了并发展了孙先生的思想，指明了中国革命经由新民主主义走向社会主义和共产主义的伟大前途。我们党有许多同志继续了孙中山先生的革命精神，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，参加了人民革命的斗争，贡献了力量。今天，由于国家形势的发展，我们党的任务是一天比一天加重了。我们为祖国三年来的伟大成就而欢呼。在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，我们的祖国是无往而不胜利的。我们要加紧努力，我们要争取在祖国向着无限美好前程迈进的途中，始终作为中国共产党和工人阶级的有力助手。我们要以无限的忠诚，贡献一切于人民祖国的伟大建设事业。
    祝大会成功！
    祝同志们健康和进步！
