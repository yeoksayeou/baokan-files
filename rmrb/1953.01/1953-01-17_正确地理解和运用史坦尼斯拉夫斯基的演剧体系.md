Correctly Understand and Apply Stanislavski's System of Acting
Jiao Juyin

Editor's Note: Today is the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the late Soviet great artist Stanislavski. He was an outstanding actor and an outstanding director. The famous acting system he created is built on a solid foundation of realism. This system has had a great impact on China's theater community. In order to commemorate this great artist, we are publishing two articles here.

In a letter to Stanislavski in January 1933, Gorky said that Stanislavski was "a person who has done a great deal in the field of drama for the happiness of the Soviet people and for the development of the beauty and strength of the Soviet people's souls." Stanislavski not only inherited the realism of Russian acting—the tradition of Shchepkin—but also developed it into a "system," a science of acting; and most importantly, this profound and creative "system" is an effective tool for expressing the people and the people's real life, that is, as he himself said, "a link in the great socialist construction."

The greatness of Stanislavski's "system" lies in the fact that it is a scientific theatrical principle created based on the materialistic worldview. This principle guides actors to correctly understand reality and the laws of reality, and at the same time, it can enable actors to accurately understand and master the laws of artistic creation.

Stanislavski's "system" is the art of experiencing.

The purpose of experiencing is to express the truth of life. The foundation of artistic truth is the reality of life. He wants actors to first immerse themselves in the reality of life, experience its spirit, understand its essence, explore its depth, master its laws, clarify its direction, and see its bright future. Only by starting from life can actors correctly express life. Therefore, Stanislavski emphasized the actor's "highest task" - to convey the leading ideas and ideals of life in the script.

From life experience to artistic creation, Stanislavski pointed out a materialistic dialectical process. An actor's creation of a role is a process of countless repetitions of practice and understanding—through perceptual knowledge of real life, to obtain rational knowledge of the script and the role; then, guided by this rational knowledge, to obtain perceptual knowledge of the role on the rehearsal stage, thereby enriching and clarifying the rational understanding of the role, repeating this process until a vivid role is created. This process is also a process of change in the actor's thoughts and feelings.

After the actor has undergone the necessary changes in thoughts and feelings, how to express this inner activity as an external image, that is to say, how to create a character image with flesh and blood? In this regard, Stanislavski's method, just like Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes, is also based on materialistic understanding. He requires actors to base their work on inner experience and connect physical activities with inner psychological activities. The psychological activity he refers to belongs to the physiological, material central nervous system. Therefore, psychological activity and physical activity are unified. This is the anti-dualistic foundation of Stanislavski's "system" as a science of acting, and also its anti-formalistic foundation.

Since 1937, we have introduced this most advanced acting science in the world to our country. Our stage art, mainly drama, began to be guided and influenced by it. After the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the significance and value of Stanislavski's "system" to China's theater community became even clearer. For ten years, Stanislavski's "system" has become a common method used by drama stage art to conduct cultural struggles nationwide. Until today, directors and actors in China's drama, film, new opera, and even local operas are studying it and practicing it in order to better express reality, more deeply express workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more correctly express history; we have indeed been greatly influenced by it in the realistic method of theatrical art creation, and have gained extremely great benefits. Today, it is of great significance that we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Stanislavski's birth with a sense of remembrance and gratitude. He not only did a great deal in the field of drama for the happiness of the Soviet people and the development of the beauty and strength of the Soviet people's souls, but also taught us a correct method to let us know how to do more in the field of drama for the happiness of the Chinese people and for the development of the beauty and strength of the Chinese people's souls! Today, when the Chinese people are continuing to resist the US and aid Korea while starting to build their great and beautiful motherland, in order to enable the people's drama to truly participate in the construction and make it a well-deserved socialist realistic weapon, a "link in the construction" of the motherland, how should we commemorate our immortal artistic mentor?

We have accepted Stanislavski's system, and we have achieved results; however, we must not shy away from the fact that in its application, we have not fully understood the realistic significance of this method, especially on what basis this method must be used to have greater realistic significance. Although this new realistic creative method has been widely used on our stage, the existence of so many formulaic, formalized, and conceptualized performances is not a powerful illustration?

Stanislavski's "system," as summarized earlier, must be based on the reality of life. It requires us to start from deeply experiencing the reality of life. However, this does not mean that mastering the "system" means mastering life. It is a bridge that guides us to deeply explore the reality of life. If we simply pursue mastering the theory of the system without understanding and applying this system through life experience, it will be built in the air and become dogma; and dogma cannot eliminate any formalism. Without following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and first investing ourselves in the fiery life for a long time and unconditionally, it is impossible to understand and apply Stanislavski's system.

If we invest ourselves in life, but do not correctly understand life, then Stanislavski's system will also be powerless for our artistic creation. Perhaps the result will be very bad. Stanislavski, in his "system," only emphasized the paramount importance of the reality of life for artistic creation, and did not focus his efforts and space on how to experience life. This important lesson needs to be supplemented by ourselves. Experiencing life, undoubtedly, must have guidance and methods. And guidance can only be obtained from systematic political study; the main method is to constantly examine one's own thoughts and feelings in the process of experiencing. Without systematic political study, we will lose the pointer for observing and understanding life, and we will not easily see the contradictions and laws that exist in life; without constantly examining our own thoughts and feelings, and not bringing out those harmful things deep in our souls to see the sun, and making them change and become healthy, we will distort life.

Attempting to directly apply the perceptual knowledge gained from life experience to the stage is also a fairly common tendency we have. Stanislavski, in his classic works "My Life in Art" and "An Actor Prepares," repeatedly emphasized that the essence of any art lies only in true "artistic truth." He said that there is a reality of life and also an artistic truth. These two truths are different, but they are as inseparable as flesh and blood. Artistic truth originates from the reality of life; and the reality of life must also be expressed more truthfully through artistic truth. In this regard, we often overlook the process of concentrated refinement and processing. In this regard, we also often overlook the unique aspects of our own national opera heritage.

When creating artistic images, we also often attempt to find a ready-made typical character in the reality of life, or to bring "some kind of statistical average" to the stage. We have not been able to deeply understand what Comrade Malenkov said in the Central Committee's report to the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that "the typical is not only the most common thing, but also the thing that most fully and sharply expresses the essence of certain social forces." And Stanislavski's "system" definitely requires us to first grasp the essence of social and historical phenomena, and then use his realistic method to prominently portray a typical character. Otherwise, his method will not be able to save our artistic creations from generalization and conceptualization.

In a word, we must strengthen political study, improve understanding, and use Stanislavski's creative methods on the basis of correctly grasping the essence of life, so that his "system" will be useful to us. At the same time, we must also learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in recent years in creatively developing Stanislavski's system theory and applying Stanislavski's system theory in opera, so that our country's drama art can become a link in the construction of the motherland.

    正确地理解和运用史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的演剧体系
    焦菊隐
    编者按：今天是已故的苏联伟大艺术家史坦尼斯拉夫斯基九十诞辰。他是杰出的演员，杰出的导演。他所创造的有名的演剧体系，是建筑在现实主义的坚固基础上的。这个体系对我国戏剧界有很大的影响。为了纪念这位艺术大师，我们特在这里发表两篇文章。
    一九三三年一月，高尔基给史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的信里，说史坦尼斯拉夫斯基是“为了苏联人民的幸福，为了发展苏联人民的灵魂的美和力量，在戏剧方面工作得特别多的一个人物”。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基不仅把俄罗斯的表演上的现实主义——史切波金的传统继承了下来，并且把它发展成了一个“体系”，一种演剧科学；而最重要的是，他这个深刻的、有创造性的“体系”，是表现人民和人民的现实生活的有效工具，也就是如他自己所说的，“伟大的社会主义建设的一环”。
    史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“体系”的伟大处，在于它是根据唯物的世界观所创造出来的科学的演剧原理，这个原理，引导着演员去正确地认识现实和现实的法则，同时，也能使演员确切地认识并掌握艺术创造的法则。
    史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“体系”，是体验的艺术。
    体验的目的，是为了表现生活的真实。艺术的真实的基础，就是生活现实。他要演员首先投入生活现实，体验它的精神，认识它的本质，发掘它的深度，掌握它的规律，明确它的方向，看到它的光明的前途。演员唯有从生活出发，才能正确地表现生活。所以，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基强调演员的“最高任务”——传达剧本里生活的主导思想和理想。
    从生活体验到艺术创造，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基指出了一个唯物辩证的过程。演员之创造角色，是一个实践和认识的无数反复的过程——通过对现实生活的感性知识，取得对剧本和角色的理性知识；再以这个理性知识为指导，在排演场上取得对角色的感性知识，从而丰富了、明确了对角色的理性认识，如此反复不已，终于创造出活生生的角色来。这个过程同时也就是演员的思想感情的变化过程。
    演员在思想感情上发生了应有的变化以后，如何把这种内心的活动，表现成为外在的形象，即是说，如何创造出有血有肉的性格化的形象呢？在这方面，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的方法，恰恰和巴夫洛夫的条件反射学说一样，也是建立在唯物的认识上的。他要求演员以内心体验作根据，由内在心理活动联系肉体活动。他所指的心理活动，是从属于生理的、物质的中央神经系统的。因此，心理活动和肉体活动是统一的。这就是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基作为演剧科学的“体系”的反二元论的基础，也就是它的反形式主义的基础。
    从一九三七年起，我们把这个世界上最先进的演剧科学介绍到我国来。我国舞台艺术主要的是话剧，开始受了它的指导和影响。毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“体系”对我国戏剧界的意义和价值更加明确地显现出来了。十年以来，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“体系”，成为话剧舞台艺术在全国范围内进行文化斗争所共同采用的方法。直到今天，我国的话剧、电影、新歌剧，乃至地方戏的导演和演员们，为了更好地表现现实，更深刻地表现工农兵，更正确地表现历史，都在钻研着它，实践着它；我们在戏剧艺术创造的现实主义的方法上，确是受了它的巨大影响，而且得到了极大的收获。我们今天带着缅怀和感谢的心情，来纪念史坦尼斯拉夫斯基诞生九十周年，是有重大的意义的。他不但为了苏联人民的幸福和发展苏联人民的灵魂的美和力量，在戏剧方面工作得特别多，而且，也教给了我们一个正确的方法，叫我们知道如何为中国人民的幸福，为发展中国人民的灵魂的美和力量，在戏剧方面工作得特别多些！在中国人民一面继续抗美援朝一面开始建设自己的伟大而美丽的祖国的今天，要使人民的戏剧真正能参加到建设里边来，使它成为名符其实的社会主义现实主义的武器，成为祖国“建设的一环”，我们必须怎样纪念我们这位不朽的艺术导师呢？
    我们接受了史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系，我们有了成绩；但是，也不必讳言，我们在它的运用上，对于这个方法的现实意义，特别是，这个方法必须在什么基础上去运用才能有更大的现实意义，并没有充分的理解。我们的舞台上，虽然普遍地运用了这个新现实主义的创造方法，可是依然还存在着那么多的公式化、形式化、概念化的表演，不正是一个很有力的说明吗？
    史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“体系”，如前边所总括了的，必须以生活现实作它的基础。它要求我们从深入地体验生活现实出发。但，这不等于说，掌握了“体系”，便掌握了生活。它是引导我们去深掘生活现实的桥梁。如果我们只单纯地去追求精通体系的理论，不通过生活体验去理解和运用这个体系，它便架了空，便成了教条；而教条是不能铲除任何形式主义的。不遵循毛主席所指示的方向，首先长期地无条件地投入到火热的生活里去，就不可能理解和运用史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系。
    如果投入了生活，而并没有正确地理解生活，那么，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系，对于我们的艺术创造，也是无能为力的。也许结果很坏。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基在他的“体系”里，只强调说明了生活现实对于艺术创造的头等重要性，而没有把力量和篇幅重点放在怎样去体验生活上。这么重要的一课，却是要我们自己去补的。体验生活，毫无疑问地，必须有指导，有方法。而指导只能从系统的政治学习得到；方法主要的是在体验过程中经常地检查自己的思想感情。没有系统的政治学习，我们就失掉观察生活认识生活的指针，我们就不易看见生活里所存在的矛盾和法则；不去经常检查自己的思想感情，不把我们灵魂深处那些有害的东西，掏出来见一见太阳，叫它们变化，健康起来，我们就会曲解生活。
    企图把生活体验当中所得来的感性知识，直接运用到舞台上，这也是我们相当普遍地存在着的倾向。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基在他的经典著作“我的艺术生活”和“演员自我修养”里，一再强调说：任何艺术的菁义，只在于真正的“艺术的真实”。他说，有一种现实的真实，还有一种艺术的真实。这两种真实有别，但又血肉一般地分不开。艺术的真实产生于现实的真实；而现实的真实，也必须通过艺术的真实，才能被表现得更真实。在这一点上，我们常常是忽略集中提炼的加工过程的。在这一点上，我们也是常常忽视我们自己的民族戏曲遗产的独到处的。
    我们在创造艺术形象的时候，也常常企图在生活现实里找到一个现成的典型，或者，把“某种统计的平均数”，搬到舞台上来，我们没有能够深切地理解马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作中央委员会的报告里所说的，“典型不仅是最常见的事物而且是最充分、最尖锐地表现一定社会力量的本质的事物”。而史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“体系”，是肯定地要求我们首先掌握住社会和历史现象的本质，再来通过他的现实主义的方法，突出地刻划出一个典型人物来的。否则，他的方法也没有法子挽救我们艺术创造上的一般化和概念化。
    一句话，我们必须在加强政治学习、提高认识的基础上，在正确地掌握生活本质的基础上，去运用史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的创造方法，他的“体系”才会对我们有用。同时，我们也必须学习苏联近年来有创造性地发展史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系理论和在歌剧上运用史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系理论的先进经验，才能叫我国的戏剧艺术成为祖国建设的一环。
