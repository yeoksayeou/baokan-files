    For the Construction of a Strong Steel Industry for the Motherland
    ——A Visit to the Geological Exploration Site of the Longyan Iron Ore District
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yuan Mu
    In the Longyan Iron Ore District, within the continuous mountains spanning hundreds of miles, the northwest wind sweeps up the snow, filling the mountains and valleys after winter sets in. During those days, groups of people, crossing mountain peaks, traversing deep ravines, and braving wind and snow, set out for the construction site early in the morning. They are electrical workers, plumbing workers, and civil construction workers from different cities, as well as nearby farmers. These people, who were strangers in the past, now have a common goal: "To help the geological exploration team discover the mineral deposits as soon as possible and build a strong steel industry for the motherland!"
    Originally, rich iron ore deposits are buried in this mountain. A geological exploration team sent by the central government in May 1952 has completed the general survey here, and in October, it began intensive preparations for large-scale drilling. This is a huge project, and in winter, it is necessary to complete the erection of tens of thousands of meters of high-voltage power lines and the laying of water pipes, and to build hundreds of offices and staff dormitories, so that dozens of drilling rigs can be started in the spring.
    The preparatory work has received strong support from the local Party organizations and the People's Government. Soon, many skilled workers were sent from various places. A certain electric power bureau sent almost more than half of its outside line workers, and farmers from dozens of miles around also voluntarily signed up with the mining area government. Many rural women encouraged their sons and husbands to go to the mountains to assist in the work.
    At the end of November last year, it snowed heavily for three consecutive days, and the outdoor temperature suddenly dropped to minus twenty-seven degrees Celsius. The electrical workers climbed onto the utility poles, which were more than three meters high, and their bodies were frozen stiff in less than ten minutes, but they rotated every five minutes and persisted in their work. They learned advanced Soviet experiences such as the "pole raising and setting method" and the "three-wire tightening method," which reduced the time to erect a utility pole from forty minutes to ten minutes, and the efficiency of tightening the wires increased threefold. Old skilled worker Yang Yucheng said: "The cold is nothing. When I heard that the motherland was going to carry out large-scale construction, I felt energetic when I worked!"
    The construction workers who built houses for the geological exploration team were mostly temporary workers from the countryside. For many years, they were accustomed to winter passing and spring coming, but this time they knew that they were building houses for geological personnel and drilling workers, and they unanimously proposed, "For the construction of the motherland, we will never go home for the New Year until the task is completed." The carpentry group of Xuan Furun learned the Xie Wanfu assembly line method, increasing the number of windows made per day from ten to twenty-six. Once, Xia Zhanyang and Meng Ying insisted on working outdoors, and their hands and feet were frozen numb. Others helped them into the house, but after warming up for a while, they immediately went out to continue working.
    To dig tens of thousands of meters of waterways more than one meter deep in the already frozen land is a very arduous task. Many strong young men, gripping the pickaxe handles tightly, could not dig out even a clod of earth, and the tiger's mouths were cracked open, aching like needles when the northwest wind blew. But no matter how difficult it was, the farmers digging the waterways continued to create new records every day. When they first started, one person could not dig even two meters long in a day, but half a month later, their efficiency increased to an average of five meters per person per day. When labor models were selected at the construction site, thirty farmers, four groups, and one team were awarded the glorious title of model. The team that was rated as a model originally had only fourteen people and was a mutual aid group from Shangcang Village nearby. Later, many more farmers from Shangcang Village came to participate in the work, and the team gradually expanded to more than forty people. In order to strengthen leadership, the Party branch secretary, deputy village chief, and civil affairs commissioner of the village people's government of Shangcang Village also personally went to the mountain to work. One day, while they were busy shoveling earth, they discussed why Chairman Mao sent so many people to this high mountain. Old man Zhang Buheng said: "Haven't you seen several new-style plows come to our village? Without iron, how could we use such pleasing new-style farm tools?" Li Jun, next to him, quickly added: "You have a shallow vision! As our mines get bigger and bigger and more and more steel is produced, our village will have tractors!"
    A seventeen-year-old rural youth, Yu Guoxiang, signed up to be a surveying worker when the topographic survey first started here in May 1952. Now he is no longer an "ordinary surveyor" who can only carry surveying instruments. Because he has lofty aspirations to build the motherland, every night after work, he follows the surveying engineers to learn arithmetic and drawing. In his small notebook, he has drawn various shapes of ore, as well as cliffs, houses, and trees. After the surveying personnel left the mine, Yu Guoxiang clearly remembered the locations of dozens of drill holes left in the vast wilderness. Every day, this lively and intelligent young man climbs from this mountain to that mountain, guiding workers and farmers in their work. Now, Yu Guoxiang is eagerly awaiting the early start of the drilling rigs, and he is determined to learn drilling technology and become a young drilling worker for the construction of the motherland.

    为了建设祖国强大的钢铁工业
    ——访龙烟铁矿区地质勘探工地
    新华社记者　袁木
    在龙烟铁矿区连绵百里的大山中，入冬后，西北风刮起满山满谷的复雪。就在那些日子里，有成群结队的人们，大清早跨过山峰，越过深沟，迎着风雪，出发到工地去。他们是来自不同城市的电气工人、水道工人和土木建筑工人，还有附近的农民。这些人过去从不相识，但现在他们却都有着一个共同的目标：“帮助地质勘探队早日把矿藏勘探出来，建设祖国强大的钢铁工业！”
    原来，这座大山里埋藏着丰富的铁矿。一九五二年五月中央派来的一个地质勘探队，已经在这里普查结束，十月份就开始紧张地为大规模钻探进行各项准备工作。这是一个巨大的工程，冬天需要完成一万数千公尺高压电线的架设和自来水管的铺设，要建筑好数百间办公室和职工宿舍。以便春天到来时，能把几十部钻探机开动起来。
    准备工作得到了当地党的组织和人民政府的大力支持，不久，各地派来了许多技术工人。某电业局几乎把一半以上的外线工人都派来了，周围几十里地的农民，也纷纷自动到矿区政府报名。许多农村妇女都鼓励她们的儿子、丈夫，上山协助工作。
    去年十一月底，接连下了三天大雪，野外的气温突然下降到零下二十七度，电气工人们爬上那三丈多高的电线杆子上，不到十分钟，全身就给冻僵，但是他们五分钟轮换一次，坚持着工作。他们学会了“拔杆立杆法”、“三线紧线法”等苏联先进经验，使立一棵电线杆子的时间由四十分钟减到十分钟，紧线工作效率提高了三倍。老技术工人杨玉成说：“冷些算不了啥，我一听说祖国要大规模建设，干起活来浑身带劲！”
    给地质勘探队建筑房屋的建筑工人，大都是来自农村的临时工，多少年来，他们就习惯于冬去春来，但这次他们知道是给地质人员、钻探工人盖房子的，他们一致地提出“为了祖国建设，不完成任务决不回家过年。”木工玄福润小组学习了谢万福流水作业法，做窗口的活一天由做十来个提高到二十六个。有一次，夏占阳和孟英坚持在室外工作，把手脚都冻的麻木了，别人把他俩搀进屋里来，但他们稍微暖和了一会，马上又出去继续工作。
    在已经封冻了的土地上，要挖出一公尺多深一万数千公尺长的水道，是一项十分艰苦的工作。许多年青力壮的小伙子，紧握住镐把，狠命地刨还刨不出一窝土来，只震得虎口都裂开口子，西北风一吹，像针刺一样的疼。但不管多么困难，挖水道的农民们，却每日每时不断地创造着新纪录。他们刚开始做的时候，一天一个人还挖不到两公尺长，但半个月以后，他们的效率就提高到每人平均日进五公尺。在工地上评选劳动模范时，就有三十个农民，四个小组，一个队，获得了光荣的模范称号。被评为模范的那个队，原来只有十四个人，是附近上仓村的一个互助组。后来，上仓村又有不少农民来参加工作，这个队逐渐扩大到四十多人。为了加强领导，上仓村党支部书记、副村长和村人民政府的民政委员等，也都亲自上山来工作。有一天他们一边紧张地铲土，一边谈论着为什么毛主席要派这么多人到这座高山上来。张步恒老汉说：“你没见咱村里来了好几部新式步犁吗？要没有铁，咱们那能使唤上那么讨人喜欢的新式农具呢？”在他旁边的李俊，紧接过来说：“说你眼光浅！咱的矿山越开越大，钢铁越来越多，咱村里就会有拖拉机了！”
    有一个十七岁的农村青年于国相，当一九五二年五月这里刚开始地形测量时，他就上山报名当了测量工人。现在他已经不是一个只能扛一扛测量仪器的“普通测工”了。由于他怀着建设祖国的远大的志愿，每天晚上工作完了时，他就跟着测量工程人员学算术，学绘图。在他的一个小本子上，画满了各种形状的矿石，还有山崖、房屋、树木。测量人员们离开了矿山以后，在一望无际的山野里，留下了数十个钻眼的位置，于国相都已记得很清楚。每天，这个活泼聪明的青年，从这座山爬到那座山，指点着工人和农民们进行工作。现在，于国相正巴望着钻探机早日开动，他决心要学会钻探技术，为祖国建设做一名年青的钻探工。
