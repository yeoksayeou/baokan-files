The day the newspaper carrying the China People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea's "Instructions on Continuing to Strengthen the Work of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea" arrived at the "People's Theater" in Tangshan City, ticket seller Han Junqing, after reading the instructions calling for "theater troupes in various regions to take turns going to Korea on a planned basis to conduct one to three months of慰问演出 (comfort performance) for the Volunteer Army," immediately held up the newspaper and shouted, "Comrades, good news!" Many young people from the Peking Opera Troupe immediately surrounded him, listening to him excitedly read aloud. This news quickly spread throughout the entire theater. The troupe comrades immediately expressed their response to the call of the China People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Youth League member Hu Chunlian was the first to write an application requesting to go to Korea to perform, followed by comrades from both the front and backstage of the entire theater writing volunteer letters, expressing their determination. Yan Junying said, "I can overcome all difficulties and contribute all my strength to Korea, dedicating my art to our most beloved people." By that evening, eighty-two comrades had happily signed up. The next day, the Peking Opera Troupe held a general meeting, where everyone spoke enthusiastically, explaining the significance of going to Korea for comfort performances, expressing their personal determination, and preparing to go to Korea at any time to perform慰问演出 (comfort performances).

    唐山市京剧团全体团员决心到前线慰问志愿军
    刊载中国人民抗美援朝总会“关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示”的报纸到达唐山市“人民戏院”的那天，售票员韩俊卿读到指示中号召“各地剧团应有计划地轮流到朝鲜为志愿军进行一个月至三个月的慰问演出”以后，立即举着报纸高喊着：“同志们，好消息！”京剧团的许多青年马上把他围住，听他兴奋地朗读着。这一消息很快就传遍了全院，剧团同志们立刻表示响应抗美援朝总会的号召。青年团员胡春莲首先写了要求赴朝演出的申请书，紧接着全院前后台同志纷纷写着志愿书，表示自己的决心。阎俊英说：“我能克服一切困难，尽我所有力量去朝鲜，把我的艺术贡献给我们最可爱的人。”到当天晚上，八十二位同志都兴高彩烈地报了名。第二天，京剧团召开了全体大会，会上大家热烈发言，说明赴朝慰问的意义，表明个人的决心，准备随时赴朝作慰问演出。　（孙玉荃）
