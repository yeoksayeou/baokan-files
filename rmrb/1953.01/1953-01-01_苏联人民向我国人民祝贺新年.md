Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: On the eve of the New Year, Soviet citizens who have visited the People's Republic of China spoke to TASS reporters, extending New Year greetings to the great Chinese people.

    Saida Akhmadova, foreman of the spinning workshop of the Stalinabad Textile Combine and representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, said: "In 1952, I participated in the Soviet trade union delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China. We saw how the liberated Chinese people are building their motherland and a new, free life with heroic labor. Many women in our Tajikistan share similarities with Chinese women. We had a terrible, enslaved past, but we have a bright and happy present and will have an even happier future. I saw how Chinese women work equally with men and how diligently they study. Like us Soviet women, Chinese women dedicate all their strength and energy to the great cause of fighting for peace, for the happiness of their children, and for the bright future of the people of the world. I wish you and all the working people of China a happy New Year. I wish you success and happiness."

    Soviet writer Vadim Kozhevnikov, who visited People's China twice this year, said: "I especially cherish the memories of your beautiful country. I have seen the great achievements the Chinese people have made in building a new life. Wherever I went in your great country, I always heard words of respect and love for my great motherland. The unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a symbol of world peace and a guarantee of the successful realization of the historical tasks facing our two countries. Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people! I wish you, the builders of new China, to complete all the tasks set for you by the Chinese Communist Party in the New Year."

    Sergei Ponomarev, an engineer at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, said: "The time spent on the friendly Chinese territory will remain in my memory for life. In the past three years, China has been completely transformed. On the eve of the New Year, I wish the Chinese workers and experts new victories in consolidating the economy of their motherland."

    Soviet People's Artist and singer Maxim Mikhailov said: "The Chinese people are full of energy and labor enthusiasm. As an actor, I am particularly pleased to see the Chinese people's love for their country's art. The New Year is coming, and I want to extend my warmest and heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people, wishing them new and great victories in their construction towards socialism and in the noble struggle for peace and friendship among the people of the world."

    Professor Vladimir Zaikov, a geographer, said:
    "On this New Year's Eve, I speak to you, the friends and comrades of the People's Republic of China, with great excitement. In China, I saw workers, farmers, cultural workers, and scientists working joyfully for the happiness and prosperity of their motherland. I saw the miraculous people's construction undertaken by the people to conquer nature. I saw the happy and joyful youth of a great people who have won freedom and independence and are determined to defend these victories with all their might. As this New Year approaches, I want to once again congratulate the eternal friendship and cultural and scientific cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese people, and congratulate the working people of the People's Republic of China on new victories in the great construction of their free country."
