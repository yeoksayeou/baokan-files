The Political Department of the North China Military Region issued a circular awarding Chang Qing a special merit.

    华北军区政治部通令嘉奖写作教学法创造者常青
    中国人民解放军华北军区第二高级步兵学校政治文化教育助理员常青创造的“写作教学法”，对目前人民解放军全军的文化教育工作是一个很大的贡献。华北军区政治部通令给常青记特等功一次。
    华北军区首长和华北军区政治部的嘉奖令中指出：这一教学方法已行之有效，解决了工农出身的干部和战士在速成识字后学习写作的许多困难；并且在“我写我”开展后，对提高部队阶级觉悟亦有相当作用。　　　（据新华社）
