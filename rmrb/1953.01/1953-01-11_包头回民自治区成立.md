Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, January 10th: The first session of the Baotou Hui Autonomous Region's People's Representatives Conference of all ethnic groups concluded on New Year's Day, 1953, after four days. The conference exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, elected Bai Fenggang (Hui) as the Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Mi Yufu (Han) and Li Ruifu (Hui) as Vice-Chairmen, and fifteen government members, and twenty-one members of the consultative committee. On that day, the Baotou Hui Autonomous Region was officially proclaimed amidst the enthusiastic celebrations of the people of all ethnic groups. Representatives from the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government attended the founding meeting of the Hui Autonomous Region.

The meeting adopted the organizational rules of the Baotou Hui Autonomous Region People's Government and the future work tasks. The representatives also discussed matters such as expanding and consolidating Hui cooperatives, strengthening leadership over Hui primary schools, and establishing a Hui Autonomous Region Health Office. They said: The happy event that we never dreamed of for many years has been realized today under the glorious illumination of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy! With boundless gratitude, the representatives passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.

The Baotou Hui Autonomous Region is located in the northeastern part of Baotou City, including the four main streets where the Hui people live. Of the 10,818 people in the entire region, more than 4,400 are Hui people, and the remaining 5,000 are people of four ethnic groups, including Mongolians, Hans, Manchus, and Uyghurs. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the higher-level People's Governments, the people of all ethnic groups have made great progress in politics, economy, and culture in the past three years. The Hui people generally demanded regional autonomy. In September 1952, the first second session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Ethnic Groups of Suiyuan Province accepted the demands of the masses and resolved that the Provincial People's Government and the Baotou Municipal People's Government should carry out the preparatory work for the establishment of the Baotou Hui Autonomous Region. In early December, the Baotou Municipal People's Representatives Conference of All Ethnic Groups, based on the spirit of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" promulgated by the Central People's Government and combined with the actual situation, discussed and adopted the "Implementation Plan for Ethnic Regional Autonomy in Baotou City," and quickly established the Preparatory Committee for the Hui Autonomous Region and formed a working group to carry out publicity. In twenty days, the working group held more than 400 large and small meetings, conducted in-depth education targeting the different ideological situations of the people of all ethnic groups, and also held Han people's conferences, repeatedly explaining the policies of ethnic unity and mutual respect for customs; at the same time, a large number of publicity forces were organized in the city to carry out publicity on ethnic regional autonomy and guarantee the rights of scattered ethnic minorities to enjoy ethnic equality. In this way, the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region was welcomed and supported by the people of all ethnic groups, and a large number of activists emerged among the people of all ethnic groups, enthusiastically participating in the national democratic construction work.

    包头回民自治区成立
    【新华社归绥十日电】包头市回民自治区首届各族各界人民代表会议历时四天，于一九五三年元旦闭幕。会议代行人民代表大会职权，选出自治区人民政府区长白凤岗（回），副区长米毓富（汉）、李瑞符（回）及政府委员十五人，协商委员会委员二十一人。当天在各族人民热烈的欢庆下，包头市回民自治区正式宣告成立。内蒙古自治区人民政府及绥远省人民政府民族事务委员会等都派代表参加了回民自治区的成立大会。
    会议通过了包头市回民自治区人民政府的组织通则及今后的工作任务。代表们并讨论了扩大和整理回民合作社、加强对回民小学的领导及建立回民自治区卫生事务所等事项。他们说：多少年来梦想不到的喜事，今天在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下实现了！代表们以无限感激的心情通过了向毛主席致敬的电文。
    包头市回民自治区位于包头市的东北部，包括回族人民聚居的四个主要街道，在全区的一万零八百一十八人中，有四千四百多回民，其余五千多人为蒙、汉、满、维吾尔等四个民族的人民。各族人民由于共产党和上级人民政府的正确领导，三年来在政治、经济、文化等各方面都有很大提高，回族人民普遍要求实行区域自治。一九五二年九月绥远省首届二次各族各界人民代表会议接受了群众的要求，决议由省人民政府及包头市人民政府进行包头市回民自治区成立的筹备工作。十二月初，包头市各族各界人民代表会议又根据中央人民政府所颁布的“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”的精神，结合实际情况，讨论并通过了“包头市回民区域自治实施方案”，很快成立了回民自治区筹备委员会，并组成工作组展开宣传。工作组在二十天中先后举行了四百多次大会、小会，针对各族人民不同的思想情况，深入地进行教育，还召开汉民大会，反复讲解民族团结和互相尊重风俗习惯的政策；同时，在全市也组织了大批的宣传力量，进行了民族区域自治和保障散居的少数民族享有民族平等权利的宣传。这样，回民自治区的成立得到各族人民的欢迎和赞助，在各族人民中涌现出大批积极分子，热情地参加了民族民主建政工作。
