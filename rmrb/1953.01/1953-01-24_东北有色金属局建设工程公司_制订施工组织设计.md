    Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau Construction Engineering Company
    Formulates Construction Organization Design
    The Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau Construction Engineering Company, under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, has learned from the lessons of previous years, where a lack of detailed construction plans and organizational designs before commencement led to passivity during the construction process. This year, they began preparations for formulating a construction organization design early.
    This work is being conducted under the personal guidance of the company's leading cadres, with the participation of fifteen individuals, including the chief engineer and site directors from various engineering departments with rich construction experience. The steps involved are: ideological mobilization, engaging in discussions, writing preliminary materials, distributing them to various engineering departments to organize technical personnel for discussion, and finally, writing a comprehensive written material for trial implementation on several construction sites with larger workloads this year.
    During the discussions, everyone, based on three years of construction experience, unanimously agreed that the quality of organizational work before construction directly affects the speed of project progress and the quality of the project. There were many such lessons learned last year. For example, when an engineering department was repairing a transportation road, it did not consider the excavation of water and heating trenches. Later, when the trench excavation project began, vehicles could not enter the site, and brick carrying had to be done manually, resulting in significant waste. Another construction site did not consider construction methods and rain protection equipment. During the rainy season, the foundation trench was filled with rainwater, and in the end, the design had to be changed, delaying the construction period by more than forty days. Based on past experience, everyone discussed in detail the content that the construction organization design should include. The company has now written the discussion results into preliminary materials, which will soon be printed and distributed to various engineering departments to organize technical personnel for discussion, and supplementary revisions will be made.
    In addition, based on the experience of temporary construction projects on the construction sites of various engineering departments in 1952, the company comprehensively designed standard drawings for three major categories of temporary construction projects: housing, tools, and model boards. These measures have prepared the ground for the construction organization design. The company is now summarizing the experience of construction organization management and design management to enrich the content of the construction organization design. (Zhang Fengsheng)

    东北有色金属局建设工程公司
    制订施工组织设计
    中央重工业部东北有色金属局建设工程公司接受历年来因开工前没有详细拟订施工方针及组织设计，以致在施工过程中处处被动的教训，今年及早开始筹备制订施工组织设计。
    这一工作是在该公司领导干部亲自主持下进行的，另有主任工程师和各工程处施工经验较丰富的工地主任等十五人参加。进行的步骤是：思想动员，展开讨论，写出初步材料，发到各工程处组织技术人员讨论，最后写成综合的书面材料，在今年工程量较大的几个工地试行。
    在讨论中，大家根据三年来的施工经验，一致认为施工前组织工作做得好坏，直接关系着工程进度快慢和工程质量的高低。去年有不少这样的教训，如某工程处在修运输道路时，没有考虑到挖水暖沟工程，后来挖沟工程开始，现场就进不去车，不得不用小工挑砖，造成很大浪费。某工地没有考虑施工方法和防雨设备，雨季地槽充满雨水，最后只好改变设计，拖延工期四十多天。联系过去的经验，大家详细地讨论了施工组织设计应该包括的内容。现在公司已把讨论结果写成初步材料，即将印发各工程处组织技术人员讨论，进行补充修正。
    此外，该公司还根据一九五二年各工程处施工现场暂设工程的经验，综合设计成房屋、工具、模型板等三大类暂设工程的标准图样。这些措施都给施工组织设计作了准备，现在该公司正在总结施工组织管理和设计管理的经验，以便充实施工组织设计的内容。（张凤生）
