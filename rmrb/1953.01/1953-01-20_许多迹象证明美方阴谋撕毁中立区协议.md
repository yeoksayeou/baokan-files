Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 18th: Special correspondent for this agency reports: In Panmunjom, there are increasing signs that the U.S. military command is step by step destroying existing agreements, and ultimately tearing them up, as part of Washington's preparations to expand the Korean War.

    Despite irrefutable evidence proving that U.S. military aircraft deliberately flew in combat formations over the conference area in clear weather, bombing and strafing nearby positions, U.S. Senior Liaison Officer Carrol rejected responsibility for this violation of the conference area airspace at the liaison officers' meeting on the 16th. This is the third denial of this kind in January.

    This situation indicates that the U.S. side is no longer merely admitting to violating agreements and then repeating the violations. Their current plan is to openly declare these destructive actions as legitimate, thereby tearing up the agreements.

    Another clear sign is the U.S. aircraft attack on the Korean-Chinese armistice negotiation delegation's convoy between Kaesong and Pyongyang in December 1952, which injured five members of the delegation convoy, despite the agreement guaranteeing the delegation's convoy immunity from attack. The U.S. Liaison Officer, "on the orders of the Chief Representative of the United Nations Command," not only refused to respond to protests against the violation of the agreement, but also issued a notice on the 15th unilaterally announcing that the delegation's daily convoy would no longer be immune from attack, thereby tearing up this agreement.

    It is very obvious that after tearing up the agreement on the convoy's immunity from attack, the U.S. military command intends to abandon the agreement and understanding on prohibiting flights over the conference area and the neutral zone, using excuses such as these overflights do not "constitute hostile acts" but fall under exceptions that are "uncontrollable due to climatic and technical conditions." It is worth pointing out that the U.S. Liaison Officer did not even present a single fact at the liaison officers' meeting on the 16th to prove that these overflight incidents were due to "climatic and technical conditions." Even the U.S. military guards on duty in Panmunjom, Sarnes and Maxfield, testified that these violations of the conference area airspace occurred in broad daylight, in clear weather. These U.S. aircraft violating the agreement and infringing upon the conference area airspace were intentionally carried out under good control conditions. They flew in combat formation over the conference area and took advantage of the convenience of flying over the area to bomb targets. Carrol could only remain silent in the face of these facts, and repeatedly said that he had nothing to say.

    Everyone knows that it was precisely due to Ridgway's encouragement that U.S. aircraft invaded the airspace over the neutral zone, strafed and bombed Kaesong, and first interrupted the armistice negotiations in August 1951. Carrol is now openly encouraging the U.S. Air Force to invade the airspace over the conference area and the neutral zone, saying that the overflights by aircraft carrying bombs and rocket launchers for massacre and reconnaissance are not "hostile acts" or violations of agreements. Such words can only indicate that the U.S. side is determined to continue creating incidents of flying over the conference area and violating the neutral zone agreement, in order to abandon the agreement and threaten the security of these areas, as a step towards expanding the war.

    许多迹象证明美方阴谋撕毁中立区协议
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社特派记者报道：在板门店目前有越来越多的迹象可以看出：美军司令部正在一步步由破坏现有协议进而撕毁这些协议，作为华盛顿扩大朝鲜战争的准备工作的一部分。
    纵然有无可争辩的证据，证明美国军用飞机曾故意排成战斗队形，在晴朗的气候中，飞越会场区，轰炸并扫射附近的阵地；然而，美方首席联络官卡洛克在十六日的联络官会议上又拒绝承认这种侵犯会场区上空的责任，这已是一月份的第三次抵赖了。
    这种情况表明：美方已不是像过去那样承认破坏协议然后再犯，他们现在的计划是公然把这种破坏行动说成合法行动而撕毁协议。
    另一种明显的迹象是：美国飞机于一九五二年十二月在开城和平壤之间袭击了朝中停战谈判代表团的车队，击伤代表团车队的五名人员，虽然协议保证代表团车队是免受袭击的。美国联络官“奉了联军司令部首席代表之命”不但拒不答复对破坏协议所提出的抗议，反而在十五日发出通知片面宣布每天往来的代表团车队将不再免受袭击，这样来撕毁这个协议。
    很明显的，美军司令部在撕毁了关于车队免受袭击的协议后，打算废弃关于禁止飞越会场区和中立区的协议与谅解，藉口说这些飞越行动不能“构成敌对行为”而是属于“气候条件与技术条件无法控制”的例外情况之类。值得指出的是：美国联络官在十六日的联络官会议上甚至没有提出一件事实，证明这些飞越事件的发生是由于“气候条件与技术条件”所致。甚至在板门店值勤的美国军事卫兵萨门斯和麦克斯菲尔德都证明这种侵犯会场区上空的行动是在大白天，在晴朗天气的情况下发生的。这些破坏协议侵犯会场区上空的美国飞机是在很好的控制条件之下有意进行的，它们排成战斗队形飞入会场区上空，并且利用飞越该地区上空的便利轰炸目标。卡洛克在这些事实面前只好哑口无言，而一再说他没有什么可说的。
    大家都知道，正是由于李奇微的鼓励，美国飞机侵越了中立区的上空，扫射和轰炸了开城，在一九五一年八月第一次中断了停战谈判。卡洛克现在又公然鼓励美国空军侵犯会场区和中立区的上空，说那些带着炸弹和火箭炮进行屠杀和侦察的飞机所作的飞越行动并不是“敌对行为”或破坏协议。这种话只能表明：美方打定主意要继续制造飞越会场区和破坏中立区协议的事件，以便废弃协议和威胁这些地区的安全，作为扩大战争的一个步骤。
