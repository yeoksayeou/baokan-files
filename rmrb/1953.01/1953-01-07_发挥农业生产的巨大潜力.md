    The list of the first batch of award recipients for the 1952 agricultural bumper harvest awards has been announced. This list demonstrates that our country's agricultural production has enormous potential strength, and also shows that we have the possibility of unleashing these potential strengths. The list that has been announced is only the first batch of bumper harvest awards for 1952. Based on the available materials, it is estimated that the number of those reaching the Central Ministry of Agriculture's bumper harvest award standards in 1952 will be more than ten times that of 1951. The ranks of advanced agricultural producers are expanding rapidly.
    Comparing the 1952 bumper harvest award list with the 1951 bumper harvest award list, it is not difficult to discover a significant change: in 1951, only a few advanced individuals achieved bumper harvests on a relatively small area, the largest of which was a township and several villages; in 1952, examples of large-scale widespread bumper harvests throughout entire counties and districts have appeared one after another. For example, the unit area yield of Zhaoyuan County in Heilongjiang Province increased by 92.9 percent compared to 1951. This proves that it is entirely possible to achieve widespread bumper harvests over large areas.
    Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams also saw a large increase in the number of cases where comprehensive bumper harvests were achieved within the entire cooperative or team in 1952 compared to 1951. Last year, the agricultural production cooperatives created new national bumper harvest records for cotton, millet, and corn. The production units of the People's Liberation Army, which have a high degree of organization, have achieved even more outstanding results. The Ma Deru group, Wang Bosheng group, and Zhu Chuanwen battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, respectively created the national highest records for unit area yield of winter wheat, spring wheat, and single-season rice. These facts not only concentratedly demonstrate the superiority of being organized, but also show that the unit area yield of various crops can be continuously improved.
    The list announced this time indicates that a large number of yields of various major crops have exceeded the national highest records of 1951. In the past, some people did not believe that certain high yields announced in 1951 were indeed true, or believed that those yields were already the "limit." However, the facts of 1952 showed that those yields are not only possible to achieve, but also can be exceeded. We can see that the yields of bumper harvest achievers are several tens or even hundreds of percent higher than the yields of local ordinary farmers. If local ordinary farmers all adopt the methods of the bumper harvest achievers, and increase their yields to the level of the bumper harvest achievers (this is not impossible, as long as the work is done well), the national yield will increase alarmingly. We can also see that many areas with very poor natural conditions, such as the mountainous areas of Pingshun and Wuxiang in Shanxi, and Shexian in Hebei, which have thick rocks and thin soil, and very few flat areas, have also achieved high-yield bumper harvest facts. There are many areas in the country where the natural conditions are much better than these areas. If these areas can achieve such high yields, it should not be a problem for most areas to follow their example.
    Now our country's large-scale economic construction has begun. Large-scale economic construction requires the agricultural production front to supply more grain and industrial raw materials. In 1953, it is required to increase grain production by 11 percent and cotton production by 16.8 percent on the basis of the comprehensive bumper harvest in 1952, and it is also required to universally develop special products, animal husbandry, and aquatic products. We believe that this requirement is entirely possible to achieve. Because the facts of large-scale bumper harvests and new records of high-yield bumper harvests that have appeared in 1952 most powerfully show that the potential capacity of agricultural production in our great motherland is extremely abundant, and also show that we have gained many good experiences in the leadership and technology of agricultural production. Those who achieved large-scale bumper harvests and created new records in 1952, in addition to leveraging the power of being organized, mostly learned from and promoted the experiences of advanced producers in 1951; some of them also developed past experiences and created better experiences. Promoting these advanced experiences is the most effective way to unleash the potential of agricultural production.
    In addition to the bumper harvest experiences in technology, particularly valuable is the experience of leading the bumper harvest movement that has appeared relatively successfully in 1952. The experience of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Heilongjiang Province in leading agricultural production is particularly worthy of our learning. Comrade Ren Guodong, Secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee, went deep into the production process, conducted a precise, systematic investigation, comparison, and analysis of the local existing bumper harvest experiences and the farming conditions of ordinary farmers, found the key to local production increase, and summarized the local applicable farming methods. They then promoted this method on the basis of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, solved many specific problems for the masses, and made the bumper harvest movement truly a mass movement of the entire county, increasing the unit area yield of the entire county by almost double compared to 1951. Zhaoyuan County has made such remarkable achievements without using one more cadre or spending one more penny of the state; they have only used more brains and done more work.
    The reasonable farming techniques summarized by Zhaoyuan County are naturally not applicable to every region in the country. However, their leadership methods should be carefully studied by leadership organs everywhere. When conducting this study, the most important thing is to compare one's own working methods and leadership style with those of Zhaoyuan County, and to seriously examine them, and should immediately put them into practical action. We suggest that leadership organs in various places, especially leadership organs at the county level, organize working groups including the main leading cadres, conduct an in-depth investigation of the local agricultural production potential, conduct a thorough analysis, and, focusing on the specific conditions related to production increase in the local area (such as climate, soil, fertilizer, varieties, cultivation methods, etc.), find the most important link among the various production increase factors, and make it the central content of the local agricultural production plan. On this basis, launch a patriotic bumper harvest movement that is implemented throughout the year and focuses on promoting science and technology and bumper harvest experiences.
    To tap potential capabilities, to summarize bumper harvest experiences, and to promote advanced experiences, it is first necessary to master agricultural science and technology. Political leadership is important, and political leadership should be strengthened in the future. However, if a cadre who leads agricultural production and rural work does not understand agricultural technology, it is absolutely impossible to do a good job of leadership, and it is even impossible to carry out leadership at all. Since you don't understand, what should you do? Only study. Naturally, to be proficient in more specialized agricultural science and technology requires long-term specialized study; but some of the most basic scientific and technical knowledge is essential for any comrade who does rural work. What we mean by studying agricultural science and technology here is not to ask all rural work cadres to go to agricultural colleges, but to require them to understand as much basic agricultural science and technology knowledge as possible, to consult with people who understand science and technology as much as possible, and to be good at learning from the masses (especially bumper harvest models), and to go deep into the production process to learn. It is wrong to see science and technology as too mysterious; it is a systematic summary of production experience, and as long as you put in the effort and study hard, anyone can learn it.
    Judging from all the advanced experiences of agricultural bumper harvests, the quality of spring plowing preparation work is very closely related to whether production can be increased. Rural work leaders should seize the preparation work for this year's spring plowing as early as possible, strengthen specific leadership, and abandon the empty slogans and generalized style. Don't just call for increasing fertilizer, but also guide the masses to prepare various different fertilizers needed by various crops during different periods, and teach the masses various methods to preserve fertilizer efficiency and increase fertilizer efficiency. Don't just call on the masses to prepare seeds, but also pay attention to selecting seeds suitable for the local climate, soil, and fertilizer, and also prepare medicines for disinfecting and preventing insects in the seeds, and earnestly teach the masses the usage and storage methods. Don't just shout about deep plowing, first solve the problem of purchasing and using new agricultural tools for the masses, as well as solving the problem of lack of livestock. Various localities should check as early as possible whether supply and marketing agencies have promoted agricultural tools and pesticides to the hands of farmers, and don't remember it only during the spring plowing season as in previous years, with supply falling short of demand on the one hand and large stockpiles on the other.
    Our motherland has extremely superior conditions in agricultural production and has great potential strength. Rural work leaders and agricultural science and technology workers should, without exception, promote the leadership experience of the Zhaoyuan County Committee, unleash the great potential of agricultural production, and strive to achieve the production increase tasks proposed to us by the state for 1953!

### 发挥农业生产的巨大潜力

    发挥农业生产的巨大潜力
    一九五二年度农业丰产奖励的第一批受奖者的名单公布了。这个名单表现出我国的农业生产有着巨大的潜在力量，也说明了我们有发挥这些潜在力量的可能性。现在已经公布的还只是一九五二年度第一批丰产奖励名单。就已有的材料估计，一九五二年达到中央农业部丰产奖励标准的，将超过一九五一年的十倍以上。先进的农业生产者的队伍是在迅速地扩大着。
    把一九五二年丰产奖励名单和一九五一年的丰产奖励名单比较一下，我们不难发现一个显著的变化：一九五一年还只是少数先进分子在比较狭小的面积上得到了丰产，其中范围最大的是一个乡和几个村；一九五二年，全县、全区范围的大面积普遍丰产的事例已经接连出现了。如黑龙江省肇源县全县的单位面积产量比一九五一年增加了百分之九十二点九。这证明了在大面积上普遍获得丰产是完全可能的。
    农业生产合作社和互助组一九五二年在全社、全组范围内达到全面丰产的，比一九五一年也大为增加了。去年创造了棉花、谷子、玉米的全国丰产新纪录的，都是农业生产合作社。有着高度的组织性的人民解放军的生产部队，成绩更为优异。驻屯新疆的人民解放军某部马德如小组、王柏生小组和竺传文营，分别创造了冬小麦、春小麦和单季稻的单位面积产量的全国最高纪录。这些事实，不但集中地表现了组织起来的优越性，也说明了各种作物的单位面积产量是可以不断提高的。
    这次公布的名单表示：各种主要作物的产量超过一九五一年全国最高纪录的，已经大批地出现了。过去，有些人还不相信一九五一年公布的某些高额产量是确实的，或者认为那些产量已经是“顶天”的了。而一九五二年的事实却说明了那些产量不但是可能达到的，而且是可以超过的。我们可以看到：丰产者的产量比当地一般农民的产量都高百分之几十以至几百。如果当地一般的农民都采用丰产者的办法，都把产量提高到丰产者的水平（这不是不可能的，只要把工作做好），全国的产量就会惊人地增加起来。我们还可以看到：许多自然条件很不好的地区，如山西的平顺、武乡，河北的涉县等山地，石厚土薄，极少平坦的地方，却也都出现了高额丰产的事实。全国比这些地区的自然条件优越的地方多得很。如果这些地区能取得这么高的产量，大部分地区向这些地区看齐应该是不成问题的。
    现在我们国家大规模的经济建设开始了。大规模的经济建设要求农业生产战线上供给更多的粮食和工业原料。在一九五三年，要求在一九五二年全面丰收的基础上再增产粮食百分之十一，增产棉花百分之十六点八，并且要求把特产、畜牧和水产都普遍发展起来。我们相信，这个要求是完全可能实现的。因为，一九五二年已经出现的大面积丰产的事实和高额丰产的新纪录，最有力地说明了我们伟大祖国的农业生产潜在能力是极其雄厚的，也说明了我们在农业生产的领导方面和技术方面已经取得了许多好经验。一九五二年得到大面积丰产的和创造了新纪录的，除了发挥了组织起来的力量之外，大都是学习了、推广了一九五一年的先进生产者的经验；他们当中有些人又发展了过去的经验，创造了更好的经验。推广这些先进经验，就是发挥农业生产潜力的最有效的方法。
    除了技术方面的丰产经验之外，特别宝贵的是一九五二年已经出现了比较成功的领导丰产运动的经验。中共黑龙江省肇源县县委领导农业生产的经验是特别值得我们学习的。肇源县委书记任国栋同志深入生产过程，把当地已有的丰产经验和一般农民的耕作情况作了精密的系统的调查、比较和分析，找到了当地增产的关键，总结出了当地适用的耕作方法。他们又在互助合作运动的基础上推广了这个方法，为群众解决了许多具体问题，使丰产运动真正成为全县的群众性的运动，使全县的单位面积产量比一九五一年增加了几乎一倍。肇源县做出这样显著的成绩，并没有多用一个干部，也没有多用国家一文钱；他们只是多用了脑筋，多做了工作。
    肇源县总结出来的合理的耕作技术，自然不是对全国每一地区都适用的。但是，他们的领导方法，无论那里的领导机关都应该好好学习。在进行这个学习时，最主要的是对照肇源县的工作方法和领导作风，把自己的工作方法和领导作风认真地作一次检查，并且应该立即见诸实际行动。我们建议各地领导机关，特别是县一级的领导机关、组织包括主要领导干部在内的工作组，对当地农业生产潜力进行一次深入的调查，加以周密的分析，针对当地与增产有关的具体情况（如气候、土壤、肥料、品种、栽培方法等），找出各种增产因素中最重要的环节，使它成为各地农业生产计划中的中心内容。在这个基础上，开展一个贯彻全年的、有重点地推广科学技术和丰产经验的爱国丰产运动。
    要发掘潜在能力，要总结丰产经验，要推广先进经验，首先要掌握农业科学技术。政治领导是重要的，今后还应加强政治领导。但是，如果一个领导农业生产和农村工作的干部不懂得农业技术，那是决不可能把领导工作做好的，甚至是根本无法进行领导的。既然不懂，怎么办呢？只有学习。自然，精通比较专门的农业科学技术，那是要经过长期的专门的学习的；但一些最起码的科学技术知识，对于任何一个做农村工作的同志都是十分必需的。我们这里所说的学习农业科学技术，并不是要所有的农村工作干部都去上农业专科学校，而是要求他们尽可能多懂得一些基本的农业科学技术的知识，多向懂得科学技术的人请教，并且要善于向群众（特别是丰产模范）学习，深入到生产过程中去学习。把科学技术看得太神秘是不对的，它是生产经验的系统的总结，只要下工夫用心钻研，谁都是可以学会的。
    从所有的农业丰产先进经验看来，春耕准备工作做得好坏，和能否增产是有很密切的关系的。农村工作领导者应当及早抓紧今年春耕的准备工作，加强具体领导，抛掉空喊的和一般化的作风。不要仅仅号召增加肥料，还要指导群众准备好各种农作物在不同期间所需要的各种不同的肥料，使群众学会保存肥效、增加肥效的各种方法。不要仅仅号召群众准备种籽，还要注意选择适合当地气候、土壤、肥料的种籽，还要把种籽消毒、防虫的药品准备好，把用法、保管法切实教给群众。不要只是空喊深耕，首先要为群众解决新式农具的购置和使用技术问题，以及解决牲畜缺乏的问题。各地要及早检查供销机构是否把农具、农药推广到农民手中去了，不要像往年一样，常常是在春耕时期才想起来，一方面供不应求，一方面大量积压。
    我们的祖国在农业生产方面有着极其优越的条件，有着极大的潜在力量。农村工作领导者，农业科学技术工作者，应当毫无例外地推广肇源县委的领导经验，发挥农业生产的巨大潜力，为实现国家向我们提出的一九五三年的增产任务而努力！
