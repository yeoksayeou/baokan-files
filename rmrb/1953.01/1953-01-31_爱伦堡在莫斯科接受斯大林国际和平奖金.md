Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: According to TASS Moscow, January 28th, the ceremony for awarding the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" to the outstanding Soviet writer and famous peace fighter Ilya Ehrenburg was held in Moscow on the 27th. Prominent Soviet scientists, trade union representatives, artists, and journalists attended the ceremony. The presidium of the ceremony consisted of the Chairman of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" Committee, Academician Skobeltsyn, Vice-Chairman Louis Aragon (French writer), "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" laureate Anna Seghers, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee Tikhonov, and others.

At the award ceremony, Skobeltsyn used passionate words to describe Ehrenburg's role in the struggle of people of all countries for peace. Representatives of the Soviet Peace Committee Tikhonov, Soviet writers representative Surkov, and representatives of Soviet women and youth then delivered speeches to congratulate Ehrenburg.

In his speech, Louis Aragon spoke about Franco-Soviet friendship as one of the conditions for world peace. He said: Today, I am speaking on behalf of the French nation, which once endowed Molière, Diderot, Balzac, Hugo, Zola, and Barbusse with creativity. This nation once destroyed the Bastille and established its own Commune with earth-shattering force; this nation once made our land burn under the iron hooves of German fascist invaders and Vichy traitors; this nation once received hope and inspiration from the news of the Soviet Red Army's glorious victories; this nation will forever remember the name of Stalingrad, and this nation, as Thorez said, will never fight against the Soviet Union. The awarding of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" to Ehrenburg emphasizes in the minds of the French people the full significance of the great traditional friendship between the peoples of France and the Soviet Union in the struggle for world peace. Anna Seghers and Colombian writer Jorge Zalamea (formerly translated as George Salamia), who is currently visiting the Soviet Union, also congratulated Ehrenburg on behalf of German cultural workers and progressive writers in Latin America, respectively.

In his acceptance speech, Ehrenburg said: The members of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" Committee have awarded me this lofty honor, not so much in recognition of my small contribution to peace, but rather in recognition of the labor, achievements, and sincerity of all Soviet men and women, in recognition of our advanced culture with its profound humanitarian character, and in recognition of the role of our people's selfless struggle. The Soviet people are devoted to peace not because they are afraid of war, but because they hate war. We have gone through various trials, and we are not afraid of intimidation. The Battle of Stalingrad was only ten years ago. Perhaps the rulers of the United States have forgotten this. But we have not forgotten, and we are not afraid of their threats. We stand up to defend peace because the victory of our ideals and our aspirations is inextricably linked to the victory of peace. When a Soviet person extends his hand, he is not issuing orders, nor is he begging for help; it is a hand willing to help others, a hand of friendship. Representatives of various countries listen to the speeches of Soviet representatives at various peace conferences because these words are backed by the labor, composure, and strength of the people of a great country.

Ehrenburg then expressed his sincere love for the peace fighters of various countries who are now being persecuted and tortured, and his confidence in the inevitable victory of the cause of peace. He concluded by saying: I have received the great honor of being able to wear on my chest the portrait of a person who is constantly and vividly impressed in the hearts of the Soviet people and in the hearts of all peace-loving men and women of our generation. It is a great happiness for me to be a soldier in the army of peace. As long as my heart is still beating, I am determined to fight together with everyone to the end for the friendship of all peoples, for culture, and for the future against darkness, evil, and war.

    爱伦堡在莫斯科接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予出色的苏联作家、著名和平战士伊利亚·爱伦堡的典礼，二十七日在莫斯科举行。参加典礼的有著名的苏联科学家、工会代表、艺术和新闻工作者。典礼的主席团由“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席、科学院院士斯科贝尔琴、副主席路易·阿拉贡（法国作家）、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人安娜·西格斯、苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫等人组成。
    斯科贝尔琴在授奖时，以热情的词句叙述了爱伦堡在各国人民争取和平的斗争中所起的作用。苏联拥护和平委员会代表吉洪诺夫、苏联作家代表苏尔科夫、苏联的妇女和青年代表们都接着发表演说，向爱伦堡致贺。
    路易·阿拉贡在发言中谈到作为全世界和平的条件之一的法苏友谊。他说：今天我是代表那曾经赋予莫里哀、狄德罗、巴尔扎克、雨果、左拉和巴比塞以创造力的法兰西民族讲话的。这个民族曾经摧毁了巴士底监狱，并惊天动地地建立起自己的公社；这个民族曾经使我们的土地在德国法西斯占领者和维希卖国贼们的铁蹄下燃烧起来；这个民族曾经从报道苏联红军辉煌战绩的消息中得到希望和鼓舞；这个民族永远记着斯大林格勒的名字，这个民族，正像多列士所说的永远不会对苏联作战。授给爱伦堡以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金，就在法国人民的心目中强调了法苏两国人民之间的为世界和平事业而奋斗的伟大传统友谊的全部意义。安娜·西格斯和现正访问苏联的哥伦比亚作家豪尔赫·萨拉麦亚（前译乔治·萨拉米亚）也分别代表德国文化工作者和拉丁美洲的进步作家向爱伦堡致贺。
    爱伦堡在致答词时说：“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会的委员们授给我这个崇高的荣誉，与其说是表彰我对和平的微小贡献，毋宁说是表彰所有苏联男女的劳动、功绩和诚意，表彰我们先进的、带有深刻人道色彩的文化，和我国人民的忘我斗争的作用。苏联人民献身和平并不是因为害怕战争，而是由于憎恨战争。我们经过了各种考验，我们是不怕恫吓的。斯大林格勒战役到今天不过十年。美国统治者或许已经忘记了这件事。可是我们没有忘记，我们不怕他们的威胁。我们站起来保卫和平，是因为我们的理想，我们的愿望的胜利与和平的胜利有着不可分割的联系。当一个苏维埃人伸出他的手来的时候，他并不是发号施令，也不是乞求援助，这是愿意帮助人的手，是友谊的手。各国代表在各种和平会议上倾听苏联代表的讲话，就是因为这些话有着一个伟大国家人民的劳动、镇静和力量做后盾。
    爱伦堡接着表示了他对现在正受着迫害和折磨的各国和平战士的由衷的热爱和他对和平事业必然胜利的信心。他最后说：我得到了能够把这个经常在苏联人民心中和我们这一代所有爱好和平的男女心中有着鲜明印象的人的肖像佩带在我的胸前的权利，是极大的光荣。我能成为和平大军中的一名兵士，这是很大的幸福。只要我的心还在跳动，我决心要和大家一起为各国人民的友好，为文化，为将来与黑暗、邪恶和战争斗争到底。
