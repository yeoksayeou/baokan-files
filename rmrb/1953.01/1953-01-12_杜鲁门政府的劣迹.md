    The Misdeeds of the Truman Administration
    In his "State of the Union Address" to Congress on the 7th, the outgoing U.S. President Truman greatly boasted about his "achievements." As everyone knows, the "achievements" of the Truman administration over the past seven years have been nothing but all-pervasive expansion abroad, and the fascistization of domestic politics and militarization of the economy in the United States.
    In April 1945, Roosevelt died of illness. According to the U.S. Constitution, Harry Truman, in his capacity as Vice President, succeeded him as President of the United States. This member of the KKK, promoted by the Kansas City bigwig Pendergast, faithfully implemented Wall Street's ambitious plan to conquer the world after taking office. In 1947, he announced the notorious "Truman Doctrine," using a large number of military advisors and a large amount of weapons to support the unpopular reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey, and to help them suppress the domestic people's liberation movement. Through this "investment," Truman turned Greece and Turkey, two countries with important strategic locations, into strongholds for U.S. imperialism to spy on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe.
    Subsequently, the Truman administration put forward the so-called "Marshall Plan." This plan, under the guise of "aid," opened the door for U.S. capital to infiltrate Western Europe. The result of the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" was the bankruptcy of national industries in Western European countries, the decline in foreign trade, the increase in national financial crises, the increasing impoverishment of the people, and the transformation of these countries into appendages of the United States.
    However, the "Marshall Plan" was only the initial stage of U.S. imperialism's overall plan of aggression. After controlling the governments of these countries through the "Marshall Plan," the U.S. government immediately took steps to directly prepare for military aggression. In 1949, the United States gathered Canada and ten Western European countries and signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington. This treaty, named for "defense," stipulated that as long as the United States launched a war in any place in the so-called "North Atlantic region," other countries participating in the treaty had the obligation to take joint military action. In this way, the United States tied these countries tightly to the U.S. war chariot. Using this treaty, the United States turned these countries into U.S. military bases, drove these countries into the abyss of large-scale arms expansion and war preparation, and seized the military command power of these countries. In 1951, Truman proposed a so-called "Mutual Security" plan to replace the "Marshall Plan," further expanding the scope of the "plan," and replacing the original deceptive arguments about "economic recovery" with obvious military purposes.
    In the Truman administration's European policy, the plot to revive German militarist forces and use them as a new vanguard for the anti-Soviet war has always occupied a central position. For this purpose, the Truman administration wantonly tore up all international agreements on solving the German question, obstructed the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity, unilaterally lifted the control over West German monopoly capital and Nazi forces, and vigorously subsidized them. In 1952, the Truman administration, in collusion with Britain and France, openly signed the so-called "General Treaty" with the West German Adenauer government, and then made the five countries of continental Western Europe and West Germany conclude the "European Army" agreement, openly carrying out the work of unlimited rearmament of West Germany. The purpose of the "European Army" agreement is to provide U.S. imperialism with an aggressive army with the West German army as its core.
    While plotting an anti-Soviet war, the United States also promoted a huge plan to completely annex Western Europe, which appeared in the guise of "European unity." Economically, the Truman administration first proposed a six-nation "Coal and Steel Community Plan" through French Foreign Minister Schuman, making the coal and steel industries of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and West Germany, and thus the entire industry, uniformly subject to U.S. monopoly capital. Politically, the U.S. government instructed Western European countries to establish a supranational organization - the European Commission, as the first step in establishing a so-called "European Federation." These two aspects, together with the aforementioned "European Army" plan, constitute the concept of "European unity" advocated by U.S. imperialism. The actual content of this concept is to turn Western Europe into U.S. barracks militarily, turn Western Europe into a U.S. colonial market economically, and turn Western Europe into a U.S. state politically.
    While invading Europe, the Truman administration stepped up its aggression against Asia. The first major thing Truman did in Asia after the war was to support the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government with huge material, financial, and military strength, in an attempt to extinguish the vigorously developing revolutionary movement of the Chinese people. However, the great victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle completely shattered this conspiracy of the Truman administration. The U.S. imperialism, whose ambition has not died, then launched a war in Korea and openly occupied Taiwan, attempting to completely annex Korea and directly attack China. However, the heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people defeated this aggression plan of the Truman administration. Under the strong pressure of the world's people demanding peace and opposing war, the Truman administration, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression, was forced to hold armistice negotiations with the Korean and Chinese sides. In the negotiations, the U.S. side constantly adopted various shameless means to delay and sabotage the negotiations, to the point of completely suspending them. Currently, the U.S. aggressors are actively preparing to expand the war of aggression.
    In order to step up its aggression against Asia, the United States stepped up the rearmament of Japan, making it a "death squad" for U.S. aggressors in the East. The United States also tried its best to gather the reactionary forces of Asian countries for its own use. To this end, it successively concluded the "U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty," the "U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Security Treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," and the illegal "Peace Treaty" with Japan in 1951.
    Under Truman's "Point Four Program," the claws of U.S. imperialism's aggression also continued to extend into the Middle East, Africa, South America, and many parts of Southeast Asia. In these regions, U.S. capital excluded the forces of other imperialisms and gradually established U.S. colonial rule.
    Within the United States, one of the main "achievements" of the Truman administration was to gradually push the United States onto a war system. Under the policy of expansion and war, the Truman administration's budget increased rapidly, reaching an unprecedentedly large number of 79 billion U.S. dollars in the 1953 fiscal year during peacetime. More than three-quarters of the national expenditure was used for war and expanding military equipment. After the outbreak of the Korean War, Truman implemented the so-called "Defense Mobilization," announced a "state of emergency," and exercised dictatorial powers. The entire country became a war factory. Millions of young people were conscripted into military service. The people's tax burden was greatly increased. The sharp inflation caused by war preparation reduced the people's actual living standards, while wages were frozen by the Truman administration's laws at very low levels. Many peaceful enterprises closed down or reduced production, and thirteen million Americans were unemployed or semi-unemployed.
    In order to stop the domestic people's opposition to the policy of aggression and war preparation, the Truman administration adopted increasingly tightened fascist measures, formulated and implemented the Taft-Hartley Act to suppress the labor movement, and carried out the so-called "loyalty investigation," passed the McCarran Act, arrested American communist leaders, and launched a rampant attack on the American working class and the American people who were fighting for peace, democracy, and the right to life. The "House Un-American Activities Committee," the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," the "Loyalty Review Board," and other numerous fascist organizations ran rampant in the country, turning the United States into a country ruled by secret agent terror.
    All this is the true content of what Truman boasted in his "State of the Union Address" submitted to Congress on the 7th that the United States "is building a solid security and lasting peace for all countries in the world," "extending a helping hand to enable them to restore their national lives and restore their status as independent and self-sufficient members of the international family"; this is what he said about the U.S. government's "caring for the people," and the "disappearance of all obstacles to democracy" within the United States.

    杜鲁门政府的劣迹
    即将下台的美国总统杜鲁门在七日向国会提出的“国情咨文”中，大大吹嘘了一番他的“政绩”。众所周知，杜鲁门政府七年多的“政绩”，就是无孔不入地向外扩张，就是美国国内政治法西斯化和经济军事化。
    一九四五年四月，罗斯福病死，按照美国宪法的规定，哈利·杜鲁门以副总统地位接任美国总统。这个由美国堪萨斯城大恶霸潘德尔加斯特一手提拔起来的三K党徒上台之后，忠实地执行了华尔街征服世界的野心计划。一九四七年，他宣布了臭名昭彰的“杜鲁门主义”，用大批军事顾问与大量武器，支持希腊和土耳其失尽人心的反动政府，帮助它们镇压国内人民的解放运动。杜鲁门通过这一笔“投资”，把希腊和土耳其这两个具有重要战略地位的国家，变成美帝国主义窥伺苏联和东欧人民民主国家的据点。
    接着，杜鲁门政府又提出了所谓“马歇尔计划”。这个计划以“援助”为名，打开美国资本渗入西欧的大门。“马歇尔计划”执行的结果，就是西欧国家民族工业的破产，对外贸易的跌落，国家财政危机增加，人民日益穷困，并使这些国家成为美国的附庸。
    然而“马歇尔计划”还不过是美帝国主义全盘侵略计划的初步。在通过“马歇尔计划”控制了这些国家的政府之后，美国政府随即采取了直接准备军事侵略的步骤。一九四九年，美国纠集了加拿大和西欧的十个国家，在华盛顿签订了北大西洋公约。这个以“防御”为名的公约规定：只要美国在所谓“北大西洋地区”任何一地发动战争，其他参加公约国家就有义务采取联合军事行动。美国就这样把这些国家紧紧系在美国的战车上。利用这个公约，美国把这些国家变成美国的军事基地，驱使这些国家陷入大规模扩军备战的深渊，并攫取了这些国家的军事指挥权力。一九五一年，杜鲁门又提出了一个所谓“共同安全”计划来代替“马歇尔计划”，更加扩大了“计划”所及的范围，并且以彰明昭著的军事目的代替了原来关于“经济复兴”的欺骗论调。
    在杜鲁门政府的欧洲政策中，复活德国军国主义势力充任新的反苏战争的急先锋的阴谋，始终占着中心的地位。为了这个目的，杜鲁门政府蛮横地撕毁了关于解决德国问题的一切国际协定，阻碍缔结全面对德和约和恢复德国的统一，片面地解除了对西德垄断资本和纳粹势力的管制并大力加以资助。一九五二年，杜鲁门政府协同英法两国与西德阿登纳政府公然签订了所谓“一般性条约”，接着又使西欧大陆五国与西德缔结了“欧洲军”协定，公开进行无限制重新武装西德的工作。“欧洲军”协定的目的就是为美帝国主义提供一支以西德军队为核心的侵略军队。
    在策划反苏战争的同时，美国还推行一种完全吞并西欧的巨大计划，这个计划是用“欧洲的统一”的面貌出现的。在经济上，杜鲁门政府首先通过法国外长舒曼提出了一个六国“煤钢联营计划”，使法、意、荷、比、卢及西德的煤钢工业，从而是整个工业，统一受制于美国的垄断资本。在政治上，美国政府指使西欧国家建立一个超国家的机构——欧洲委员会，作为建立所谓“欧洲联邦”的初步。这两方面加上前述的“欧洲军”计划，就构成了美帝国主义所鼓吹的“欧洲统一”的概念。这个概念的实际内容，就是在军事上把西欧变成美国的兵营，在经济上把西欧变成美国的殖民地市场，在政治上把西欧变成美国的一个州。
    与侵略欧洲同时，杜鲁门政府加紧对亚洲进行侵略。战后杜鲁门在亚洲所做的第一件大事就是以巨大的物力、财力和军事力量，支持蒋介石反动政府，企图扑灭中国人民蓬勃发展的革命运动。但是中国人民解放斗争的伟大胜利彻底粉碎了杜鲁门政府的这一阴谋。野心未死的美帝国主义于是在朝鲜发动了战争，并公开占领台湾，企图完全吞并朝鲜，直接进攻中国。但是朝中人民的英勇斗争又击败了杜鲁门政府的这一侵略计划。在全世界人民要求和平反对战争的强大压力下，在侵略战争中遭受惨败的杜鲁门政府被迫与朝中方面举行停战谈判。在谈判中，美方却不断采取种种无耻手段，拖延和破坏谈判，以至完全中止谈判。目前美国侵略者正积极准备扩大侵略战争。
    为了加紧侵略亚洲，美国加紧重新武装日本，使之成美国侵略者的在东方的“敢死队”。美国并竭力纠集亚洲国家的反动势力供它驱使。为此在一九五一年曾先后缔结了“美菲联防条约”，“美澳新三国安全条约”，“美日安全条约”，和非法的对日“和约”。
    在杜鲁门的“第四点计划”下，美帝国主义侵略的魔爪也不断伸入中东，非洲，南美及东南亚许多地方。在这些地区，美国资本排斥其他帝国主义的势力，逐步建立美国的殖民统治。
    在美国国内，杜鲁门政府的主要“政绩”之一，就是把美国逐步推上了战争体制。在扩张和战争政策下，杜鲁门政府的预算急速增加，一九五三年度，预算达到七百九十亿美元的和平时期空前庞大的数目。国家开支的四分之三以上用于战争和扩张军备。在朝鲜战争发动后，杜鲁门实施了所谓“国防动员”，宣布了“紧急状态”，行使了独裁大权。整个国家变成了战争工厂。几百万的青年被征服兵役。人民的捐税负担大大增加。备战所造成的急剧的通货膨胀降低了人民的实际生活水平，而工资却被杜鲁门政府的法律冻结在很低的水平上。许多和平企业倒闭或减产，一千三百万的美国人民失业或半失业。
    为了制止国内人民对侵略备战政策的反对，杜鲁门政府采取愈来愈加紧的法西斯措施，制订和实施了镇压工人运动的塔夫脱—哈特莱法，又进行所谓“忠诚调查”，通过麦卡伦法，逮捕美共领袖，向美国工人阶级及美国争取和平、民主与生活权利的人民进行猖獗的进攻。“非美活动调查委员会”、“联邦调查局”、“忠诚调查委员会”等名目繁多的法西斯组织在国内横行，把美国变成了一个特务恐怖统治的国家。
    这一切，就是杜鲁门在他七日提交国会的“国情咨文”中吹嘘的美国“在世界上为各国建立巩固的安全和持久的和平”，“伸出援助的手使它们能够恢复它们国家的生活并恢复它们在国际大家庭中的独立和自给自足的成员国的地位”；就是他所说的美国政府的“爱护人民的心思”，美国国内“一切对民主的障碍都在消失”的真实内容。（新华社）
