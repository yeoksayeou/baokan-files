Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 21st: State-owned, joint state-private, and local state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest Region have basically completed the formulation of their 1953 production, financial, and technical plans. The plans of most factories and mines are based on average advanced technical and economic norms, ensuring the guiding significance of the plans. The state's production tasks assigned to factories and mines in the Southwest Region for 1953 all exceed those of 1952. The plans formulated by most factories and mines meet the state's target indicators, and some even exceed the state's requirements. For example, compared with last year, the task of state-owned steel plants in the Southwest Region this year increases steel ingot production by 44.5 percent and steel production by 19 percent; while in the 1953 plans formulated by the state-owned steel plants, steel ingot production exceeds the state's assigned task by 7 percent, steel production exceeds the state's task by 5 percent, and quality standards are also higher than last year. Production efficiency and technical level of various factories and mines in the Southwest Region will take a big step forward in 1953 compared to 1952.

　　In formulating the 1953 production, financial, and technical plans, most factories and mines in the Southwest Region have combined it with the ongoing production reform work. They submitted the draft 1953 plans to the masses of workers for discussion, allowing them to offer amendments, thus ensuring that the plans are advanced, practical, and have a mass foundation. In some factories, the masses of workers corrected the conservative thinking of a few technicians and administrative managers during the mobilization of the masses for discussion. The workers of State-owned Steel Plant 102 generally proposed reflecting the achievements of improved quality through the technical operating procedures and implementation of technical supervision formulated during the production reform in the fourth quarter of 1952 into the technical plan, so that the quality in the plan is fully guaranteed. After the plans were formulated, the workers of each factory and mine expressed confidence in completing them. Steel Plant 101 immediately signed a collective contract between the administration and the trade union, with the trade union representing all workers to ensure the completion of the state plan for 1953.

　　In the process of formulating the 1953 plans, some leading cadres in factories and mines in the Southwest Region also exhibited extremely serious conservative thinking. Responsible cadres of the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Southwest Industrial Department and responsible cadres of the Sichuan Cement Plant and the 301 Potassium Chlorate Plant under its jurisdiction showed the most serious performance in this regard. The plans for cement and potassium chlorate did not meet the state's task indicators. For example, regarding the cement problem, the responsible cadres of the Southwest Chemical Industry Bureau and the Sichuan Cement Plant both used the excuse of emphasizing that increasing output would affect quality, but in reality, they wanted to set the plan lower in order to overfulfill it. The Southwest Financial and Economic Committee instructed them to rely on the masses to formulate advanced plans. However, after three revisions, the plan was still about the same as last year's planned output and failed to meet the state's task indicators for this year. In fact, in the production reform, the workers of the Sichuan Cement Plant have high production enthusiasm and their potential is being fully exploited. The daily output of rotary kiln cement has already exceeded 11 percent of the state's daily output target for this year; the workers have expressed that they can completely exceed the state's assigned tasks. However, the responsible cadres of the Southwest Chemical Industry Bureau and the Sichuan Cement Plant did not see this; at the same time, they did not see that in the large-scale construction, the Southwest Region needs a large amount of cement, which cannot yet be met. Now, the production plan for this year compiled by the Southwest Chemical Industry Bureau and the Sichuan Cement Plant still has not reached the state's targets. The Southwest Financial and Economic Committee has signed its disagreement with this conservative production plan and has sent the plan to the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry for review.

### 西南区厂矿编制今年生产财务技术计划  大部计划根据平均先进技术经济定额制成

    西南区厂矿编制今年生产财务技术计划
    大部计划根据平均先进技术经济定额制成
    【新华社重庆二十一日电】西南区国营、公私合营、地方国营工厂矿山已基本上编制出一九五三年生产、财务、技术计划。大部分工厂矿山的计划都是根据平均先进技术经济定额制定的，保证了计划的指导意义。一九五三年国家给予西南各工厂矿山的生产任务都超过一九五二年，大部分工厂矿山编制的计划都达到国家的任务指标，有的并超过国家的要求。如西南各国营钢铁厂今年的任务和去年相比，钢锭产量提高百分之四十四点五，钢材产量提高百分之十九；而各国营钢铁厂一九五三年编制的计划中，钢锭产量又超过国家给予的任务百分之七，钢材又超过国家任务百分之五，质量标准也比去年提高。西南各工厂矿山生产效率、技术水平在一九五三年将比一九五二年大大地迈进一步。
    西南各工厂矿山编制一九五三年生产、财务、技术计划中，多数工厂矿山是和正在进行的生产改革工作结合进行的。他们把一九五三年的计划草案交给职工群众讨论，让他们提出修正意见，所以保证了计划的先进、切实和有群众基础。有的厂在发动职工群众讨论中，群众纠正了少数技术人员和行政管理人员的保守思想。国营一零二钢铁厂职工群众普遍提出把一九五二年第四季度生产改革中制定的技术操作规程、实行技术监督使质量提高的成果反映到技术计划中，使计划中的质量有充分的保证。计划制定后，各工厂矿山工人都表示有信心完成。一零
    一钢铁厂并立刻签订行政和工会的集体合同，工会代表全体工人保证完成一九五三年的国家计划。
    西南各工厂矿山在编制一九五三年计划中，也有部分单位领导干部有极严重的保守思想。西南工业部化学工业管理局负责干部和所属的四川水泥厂、三零一氯酸钾厂负责干部在这方面表现得最为严重。水泥和氯酸钾的计划都未达到国家的任务指标。比如水泥问题，西南化工局和四川水泥厂的负责干部都借口强调要提高产量就会影响质量，实际上是想把计划订低一些，以便超额完成计划。西南财政经济委员会曾指示其必须依靠群众制定先进的计划。但是，经过三次修改，计划仍然和去年的计划产量差不多，达不到国家今年的任务指标。实际上，在生产改革中，四川水泥厂工人生产情绪很高，潜力正在充分发挥，现在旋窑水泥的日产量已超过国家今年任务指标日产量的百分之十一；工人们都表示完全可以超过国家给予的任务。但是，西南化工局和四川水泥厂的负责干部都没有看到；同时，他们也没有看到在大建设中，西南正需要大量的水泥，而现在还不能满足需要。现在，西南化工局和四川水泥厂编出的今年的生产计划仍然没达到国家指标，西南财政经济委员会已签署不同意这个保守的生产计划，并已将计划送中央重工业部审查。
