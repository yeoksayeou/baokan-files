    Excessive Working Hours for Employees in Many Private Enterprises in Hebei Province

    To the Editor: Employees in many private enterprises in Hebei Province work excessively long hours, which severely damages their health.

    According to surveys in three areas—the Third District of Baoding City, Hangu Town, and Ningjin County—the problem of excessive working hours for employees in private enterprises is very serious. In the Third District of Baoding City, employees in the noodle and iron industries generally work 14 hours a day, with the longest reaching 16 hours. Employees in the tire repair industry generally work 15 hours a day, with the longest reaching a shocking 19 hours. In Hangu Town, a survey of 99 private enterprises found that 80 of them had employees working 15 to 18 hours, and 18 had employees working 11 to 14 hours. In Ningjin County, among 47 private enterprises surveyed, 37 had employees working 15 to 18 hours, and the other 10 worked between 13 and 14 hours. This situation has already severely damaged the health of many employees.

    I believe that trade union organizations and labor departments of the People's Government at all levels in Hebei Province should pay attention to this issue and resolve it step by step in conjunction with the work of establishing labor-capital contracts. Zhao Hongtao

    Editor's Note: State-private joint enterprises should generally implement an eight- to ten-hour working day; scattered workshops, stores, and industries with intermittent work should not exceed twelve hours at most. In certain industries in certain areas of Hebei Province, employees work more than twelve hours, some even as long as eighteen or nineteen hours, which is obviously unreasonable. The local People's Government's labor departments should, in conjunction with trade union organizations, resolve this issue in a prepared and step-by-step manner.

### 河北省很多私营企业职工工作时间过长

    河北省很多私营企业职工工作时间过长
    编辑同志：河北省很多私营企业职工工作时间过长，以致严重地损害了他们的健康。
    根据保定市第三区、汉沽镇和宁晋县三个地区的调查，私营企业职工工作时间过长的问题是很严重的。保定市三区面食业和铁商业的职工一般每天工作十四小时，最长的达十六小时；胶轮修补业职工一般每天工作十五小时，最长的竟达十九小时。汉沽镇调查了九十九户私营企业，职工工作时间十五小时到十八小时的达八十户，十一小时到十四小时的共十八户。宁晋县调查的四十七户私营企业中，职工工作时间十五小时到十八小时的三十七户，其它十户也在十三、四小时之间。这种情况已经使很多职工健康受到严重损害。
    我认为：河北省各地工会组织和人民政府劳动部门应该重视这个问题，并结合订立劳资合同的工作有步骤地加以解决。赵洪涛
    编者按：公私企业一般应实行八小时至十小时的工作制；零散的作坊、商店和工作有间歇的行业，工时最多也不应超过十二小时。河北省某些地区的某些行业，职工工作时间超过十二小时，有的甚至长达十八、九小时，这种情况显然是不合理的。当地人民政府的劳动部门应该会同工会组织，有准备、有步骤地解决这个问题。
