    Introduction to "Design Budget and Plan of Basic Construction in the Soviet Union"
    Wang Huadong
    Translated by Shu Fan, published by Fuel Industry Publishing House, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore

    The book "Design Budget and Plan of Basic Construction in the Soviet Union" published by the Fuel Industry Publishing House introduces in detail the advanced experience accumulated by the Soviet Union in its unprecedented large-scale construction work, as well as the important decrees and their appendices currently in effect in the Soviet Union regarding the management of basic construction. As the publisher stated, this book "has significant reference value for all departments and workers in our country related to basic construction work."

    The book is divided into three parts: "Design of Basic Construction," "Budget of Basic Construction," and "Plan of Basic Construction," as well as twelve appendices compiled and translated from excerpts from the "Collection of Soviet State-Owned Industrial Laws and Regulations" and the "Collection of Basic Construction Laws and Regulations." It begins by making it extremely clear to us the importance of the design, budget, and plan of basic construction, as well as the relationship between them. It points out: "The implementation of any basic construction project must begin with design work. The budget of basic construction is the result of a series of calculations based on the design. The design and budget together constitute the document that stipulates the basis of the state's annual basic construction plan... For construction and installation projects, construction shall not be carried out without the technical design and attached budget approved in accordance with the procedures stipulated by law." (Page 9 of the original book)

    Next, it elaborates on pre-design preparation work, the content of design work, and design organization and design contracts. All of these issues are precisely what all departments and workers in our country related to basic construction work urgently need to understand today. For example, regarding the organization of design, the book says: "In the Soviet Union, many design organizations have been established to meet the needs of large-scale basic construction projects. Each industrial ministry, transportation ministry, and even some general administrations have their own design organizations, specializing in the design of construction projects in that industrial sector." (Page 44 of the original book) According to Soviet experience, concentrating all design work in specialized design organizations has many benefits. Because of this, each design organization can accumulate design experience and design data from various sectors of the national economy, which can improve the quality of design work and accelerate the smooth progress of design work. The "Budget of Basic Construction" chapter, in addition to telling us that "a strict basic construction plan and a strict budget are absolute necessary conditions for establishing construction business" (page 49 of the original book), also tells us that in order to check the progress of basic construction, in the accounting reports and final accounts of basic construction, various actual expenditures can be compared with similar items in the construction budget to allow leadership at all levels to grasp the situation of basic construction work. This chapter also describes the elements of the budget value of basic construction, the budget quota manual, the determination of several prices in the budget, and the preparation of the budget.

    This chapter is very important for our basic construction work today. For example, regarding the issue of thrift, some people in our basic construction departments still have some remnants of the supply system mentality and do not carefully calculate various expenses; others like to use valuable materials regardless of whether the facts require it. The book tells us this: "The most important task in preparing the budget is to save funds invested in construction from all aspects, reduce construction costs, and try to replace valuable materials with ordinary building materials as much as possible." (Page 80 of the original book)

    The plan for basic construction is precisely the problem that China urgently needs to solve. The third part of the book says: "The basic tasks of the basic construction plan are: to determine the correct proportions for the development of various sectors of the national economy, to ensure the growth of production determined in the long-term plan, to prepare the necessary reserve production capacity, to ensure the high effectiveness of basic investment, to determine the correct geographical distribution of construction projects, to ensure the further improvement of the economy and culture of various national republics, to ensure consistency with the long-term plan and to concentrate funds on the most important construction projects and objects." (Page 140 of the original book) We have not done enough in all aspects of this. For example, the underestimation of seeking, discovering, and utilizing the potential power within production when formulating plans is a clear example. These shortcomings must be overcome in the future.

    In addition, in the past, in our basic construction work, there were not only many phenomena of changing designs, budgets, and plans halfway through, but also serious phenomena of blindly starting construction without any design at all. What measures did the Soviet Union take regarding this phenomenon? The book points out: "The Soviet People's Committee and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) emphasized that in order to successfully solve these tasks, it is necessary to resolutely improve the daily economic and technical leadership in basic construction, and to require the People's Commissariats and banks of various economic departments to establish strict and effective supervision over basic construction." (Page 173 of the original book)

    At the beginning of the large-scale first national five-year construction plan, in order to reduce or avoid errors in basic construction and to successfully complete this great construction plan, it is very necessary for all relevant basic construction departments and basic construction workers to deeply study and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in this regard. Therefore, the publication of this book is indeed of great significance.

    介绍“苏联基本建设的设计预算与计划”

    燃料工业出版社出版的“苏联基本建设的设计预算与计划”一书，具体地介绍了苏联在空前巨大规模的建设工作中所积累的先进经验，以及苏联现行有关管理基本建设的重要法令及其附件。正如出版者所说，该书“对于我国一切与基本建设工作有关的部门和工作者，都有重大的参考价值。”
    该书计分“基本建设的设计”、“基本建设的预算”和“基本建设的计划”三篇，以及根据“苏联国营工业法令汇编”和“基本建设法令汇编”两书摘要编译出来的附录十二项。它一开头就极其明确地告诉我们基本建设的设计、预算与计划的重要性，以及彼此之间的关系。它指出：“任何基本建设工程的进行都必须从设计工作开始。基本建设的预算是根据设计所作的一系列计算的结果。设计和预算合成一起所构成的文件是规定国家年度的基本建设计划的基础……。对于建筑安装工程，凡是没有按照法令规定程序批准技术设计及所附预算者一律不得施工。”（原书第九页）
    接着，它就阐释了设计前的准备工作、设计工作的内容和设计组织与设计合同等问题。所有这些问题，也正是今天我们一切与基本建设工作有关的部门和工作者所迫切需要了解的。例如，关于设计的组织，书中说：“在苏联，适应巨大规模的基本建设工程的需要成立了许多的设计组织。每一工业部、交通部以至有的管理总局都有自己的设计组织，专门从事该产业部门建设工程的设计工作。”（原书第四十四页）根据苏联经验，把一切设计工作集中于专门的设计组织，好处是很多的。因为这样，各设计组织就能积累各个不同国民经济部门的设计经验和设计资料，可以提高设计工作的质量，加速设计工作的顺利进行。 “基本建设的预算”一篇除了告诉我们“严格的基本建设计划和严格的预算是建立起建设业务的绝对必要条件”（原书第四十九页）外，并告诉我们，为了检查基本建设的进行，在基本建设的会计表报和决算中，可以把各项实际支出以及它和建设预算的同类科目加以比较表示出来，以便各级领导机关掌握基本建设工作的情况。在这一篇中，还叙述了基本建设预算价值的要素，预算定额手册，预算中几种价格的决定以及预算书的编制等。
    这一篇对于我们今天的基本建设工作很重要。例如关于节约问题，在我们基本建设部门中，有些人还多少残存着供给制的思想，对于各种费用不精打细算；还有些人不管事实是否需要，喜用贵重材料。书中就这样告诉我们：“在编制预算时的最重要的任务是从各方面节约投入建设的资金，减低建设费用，尽量设法用普通建筑材料代替贵重材料。”
    （原书第八十页）
    关于基本建设的计划正是我们中国急需解决的问题。该书的第三编说：“基本建设计划的基本任务是：规定各国民经济部门发展的正确比例，保证长期计划中决定了的生产的增长，准备必要的后备生产能力，保证基本投资的高度效果，规定建设对象的正确的地域分布，以保证各民族共和国的经济、文化的进一步提高，保证与长期计划取得一致并集中资金于最重要的建设和对象。”（原书第一百四十页）这一点，我们各方面都做得很不够。如在制订计划时，寻求、发现和利用生产内部潜在力量的估计不足就是一个明显的例子。这些缺点今后必须力予克服。
    此外，过去在我们的基本建设工作中，不仅中途改变设计、预算、计划的现象很多，甚至还有根本不经设计就盲目施工的严重现象。对于这种现象，苏联是采取什么办法的呢？书中指出：“苏联人民委员会和联共（布）中央委员会强调指出，为了胜利解决这些任务，要求坚决改善基本建设中的日常的经济和技术的领导，要求各个经济部门的人民委员部和银行对于基本建设建立严格有效的监督。”（原书第一百七十三页）
    在大规模的第一个国家五年建设计划刚刚开始的时候，为了减少或避免在基本建设中的错误，胜利地完成这一伟大的建设计划，所有一切有关基本建设部门和基本建设工作者，深刻地研究与学习苏联在这一方面的先进经验是非常必要的。因之，这一本书的出版确实具有非常重要的意义。
