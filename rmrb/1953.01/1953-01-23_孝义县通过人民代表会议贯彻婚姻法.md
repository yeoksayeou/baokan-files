    Xiaoyi County Implements Marriage Law Through People's Representative Conference
    Editor: The Xiaoyi County People's Government of Shanxi Province, following the notice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government urging all regions to implement the Marriage Law through People's Representative Conferences, and the instructions from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government regarding the need to discuss the implementation of the Marriage Law at People's Representative Conferences, and accepting the opinion from the "Reader's Letter" column of the People's Daily on December 14th last year, "Xiaoyi County Should Inspect the Implementation of the Marriage Law," discussed the issue of implementing the Marriage Law at the first session of the second Xiaoyi County People's Representative Conference held on December 21st last year.

    At the meeting, Dong Zongyuan, Deputy County Head of the county, gave a preliminary inspection report on the implementation of the Marriage Law. The report stated that although the Xiaoyi County People's Government had made some achievements in implementing the Marriage Law over the past year, it had not seriously and consistently emphasized this work, resulting in many people not understanding the Marriage Law. As a result, from July to October last year alone, three cases of women being brutally murdered occurred consecutively, in one of which the perpetrator fled and has not yet been captured. The handling of marriage issues was not timely. Some cadres did not actively support women's correct actions in demanding freedom of marriage. In the future, in addition to designating the Marriage Law as a subject for professional study and publicizing and implementing it to the masses at all times, relevant departments of the County People's Government will also regularly inspect the implementation and promptly handle any problems that arise. Deputy County Head Dong also requested all People's Representatives to inspect and expose problems existing in the People's Government's implementation of the Marriage Law in order to correct and handle them. When discussing Deputy County Head Dong's report, the People's Representatives pointed out that the County People's Government had not done enough in implementing the Marriage Law. Although the perpetrators in two of the three cases of women being murdered had been arrested, they had not been sentenced in a timely manner, which aroused public anger. The People's Representatives requested the County People's Government to immediately severely punish the murderers of women according to the law; and exposed some improperly handled marriage cases. They revealed that Zhao Jixi of Sidi Village in the county chased his freely married daughter Zhao Jinmei with a stick, threatening to beat her to death, causing Zhao Jinmei and her husband to hide more than twenty miles away, afraid to return to their original village, while the relevant district and village cadres did not pay attention to it. Based on the opinions of the People's Representatives and with the approval of the higher-level People's Government, the County People's Government immediately organized a temporary criminal court on December 24th last year, publicly tried Wang Dasen, who brutally murdered his wife because she demanded a divorce, and Zhang Renyi, who brutally murdered a woman, and executed the two murderers on the spot. After this, the masses were universally pleased. In addition, at this People's Representative Conference, a resolution on vigorously implementing the Marriage Law was also passed.

    孝义县通过人民代表会议贯彻婚姻法
    编辑同志：山西省孝义县人民政府，遵照中央人民政府内务部督促各地通过人民代表会议贯彻婚姻法的通知，和山西省人民政府关于在人民代表会议上须讨论贯彻婚姻法的指示，并接受去年十二月十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏“孝义县应当检查执行婚姻法的情况”的意见，在去年十二月二十一日召开的孝义县第二届第一次各界人民代表会议上，讨论了关于婚姻法的贯彻执行问题。
    会上，该县副县长董宗元对婚姻法贯彻执行情况作了初步的检查报告。报告中说，一年来孝义县人民政府在贯彻执行婚姻法上虽有一定的成绩，但没认真和经常地重视这一工作，致使不少群众还不了解婚姻法。因此，仅去年七月到十月，即连续发生妇女被惨杀的案件三起，其中一案凶犯潜逃，到现在还没有捕获。在处理婚姻问题上，不及时。有些干部对妇女要求婚姻自由的正确行动，没有积极支持。今后，县人民政府有关部门除把婚姻法确定为业务学习的内容之一、随时随地向群众宣传贯彻外，并经常检查贯彻执行情况、及时处理所发生的问题。董副县长并请求各人民代表检查、揭发人民政府在贯彻执行婚姻法中存在的问题，以便纠正和处理。各人民代表在讨论董副县长的报告时，指出县人民政府贯彻婚姻法做得不够。三件妇女被杀的惨案，其中两凶犯虽已逮捕，但没有及时判处，以致引起民愤。各人民代表提请县人民政府立即依法严惩杀害妇女的凶犯；并揭发了某些处理不当的婚姻案。他们揭发了该县寺底村赵吉喜持棍追赶他的自由结了婚的女儿赵金梅，声言要打死她，以致赵金梅夫妇到现在仍躲在二十多里以外的地方，不敢回原村，而有关区、村干部却不加闻问。县人民政府根据各人民代表的意见，经上级人民政府的批准，立即在去年十二月二十四日组织成临时刑事法庭，公审了因妻子要求离婚而惨杀了妻子的王大森和惨杀妇女的张仁义，并当场把该二凶犯枪决。这样以后，群众人人称快。另外，在这一次人民代表会议上，还通过了一项关于大力贯彻婚姻法的决议。        郑效恩
