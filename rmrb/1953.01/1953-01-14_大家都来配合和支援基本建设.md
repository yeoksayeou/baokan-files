Everyone Should Cooperate and Support Basic Construction

"Put basic construction first!" All aspects should arrange their work around this central task, and all forces should do their best to cooperate with and support basic construction. In fact, the main forces of our various major departments are concentrated on striving to better and faster complete various basic construction tasks. However, there are many large and small aspects that have not yet provided the necessary support to basic construction. Recently, this newspaper received letters from construction workers at several basic construction sites, reflecting their correct demands and opinions on labor protection, welfare, and cultural life. Some of these issues fall within the scope of work of the construction department and construction union, some belong to the construction unit, and some are directly related to departments such as transportation, trade, cooperatives, banks, telecommunications, publishing and distribution, culture and art. It is hoped that these large and small departments will be responsible for helping to solve these problems. Of course, some problems cannot be completely solved all at once (such as medical care), but in the face of these most important new problems, we should immediately mobilize forces and formulate specific steps for gradual resolution.

Of course, it is difficult to solve the various demands of basic construction workers. But as long as we can mobilize and rely on the masses, many difficulties can be gradually overcome. Now, cadres and the masses in all aspects are thinking and studying the question of "How can we serve the basic construction of the motherland?" for the sake of the motherland's large-scale basic construction. Many people have already written letters to this newspaper to report their wishes and determination on this issue. This is a very valuable political enthusiasm. This enthusiasm will bring endless strength to the construction of the motherland. Therefore, the responsibility of the leading organs lies in promptly discovering and attaching importance to this issue, and organizing units under various systems to seriously discuss this issue under leadership. Doing so can not only solve how to implement the policy of putting basic construction in the primary position in this department, but also mobilize everyone to serve basic construction through their own work, and at the same time improve the work of this unit. The mass reports published by this newspaper today are facts of the masses supporting basic construction in various places, especially the "living post office" on the construction site, which is a living example. The spirit and practice of young postman Zhang Daozhong in serving the workers at the basic construction site is worthy of our good learning. It is hoped that cadres and the masses in all aspects will come up with various methods to actively cooperate with and support the worker comrades of basic construction, and think of many methods to encourage and comfort them.

As for the leading comrades of various basic construction units, they cannot sit and wait for support from all sides, but should actively do everything possible to strive for support from all sides. Furthermore, they must not neglect the various urgent demands of the workers because they cannot get certain support from all sides for the time being. They should take good care of the various vital interests of the workers, and educate and organize workers on the construction site to use their own strength to solve their own problems. For example, appropriately improving workers' accommodation and food, and taking care of workers' rest, are all urgently needed and can be done; and as for the improvement of medical conditions, although it is a problem that is relatively difficult to do immediately, it is entirely possible to educate and organize workers on how to conduct safe production and prevent casualties. Worker comrades in various basic construction projects should also actively come up with many methods to strive for cooperation and support from all sides, and come up with various methods to exert their own strength to solve their own problems as much as possible.

It is hoped that cadres and worker comrades in various basic construction projects will write to us more, putting forward your demands and opinions on all aspects, and introducing how you are working hard. It is hoped that large and small departments in all aspects will write to us more, reporting how you are carrying out or how you are preparing to carry out cooperation with basic construction work. It is hoped that cadres and the masses in all aspects will write to us more, talking about how you plan to serve the basic construction of the motherland. It is hoped that everyone will cooperate and support, to ensure the better and faster progress of the motherland's large-scale basic construction.

### 大家都来配合和支援基本建设

专栏：读者来信简评

    大家都来配合和支援基本建设
    “把基本建设放在第一位！”各方面都应当围绕这个中心工作来布置自己的工作，各方面的力量都应当尽量地配合基本建设、支援基本建设。事实上，我们各种主要部门的主要力量都集中在为保证更好更快地完成各项基本建设任务而努力。但是有不少大的方面和小的方面，还没有及时地给基本建设方面以应有的支援。最近本报收到若干基本建设工地建筑工人的来信，这些来信反映了他们对劳动保护、生活福利及文化生活等方面的正确要求和意见。这些问题有的是属于建筑部门和建筑工会工作范围以内的，有的是属于施工单位的，有的是和交通、贸易、合作社、银行、电信、出版发行、文化艺术等部门有直接关系的。希望这些方面的大小部门，负责来帮助解决这些问题。当然有些问题不是一下就能完满解决的（如医药），但应该在这些最重要的新问题面前，立即动员力量，订出逐步解决的具体步骤。
    当然，要解决基本建设工人各方面的要求是有困难的。但是只要我们能够发动和依靠群众，很多困难都可以逐步克服。现在，各方面的干部群众为了祖国大规模的基本建设，都正在思考和研究着“我们怎样为祖国的基本建设服务”的问题。不少人已经把自己对这个问题的愿望和决心写信报告本报。这是十分可贵的政治热情。这种热情将给祖国的建设带来无穷无尽的力量。因此，领导机关的责任在于及时地发现和重视这个问题，有领导地组织各系统所属单位认真讨论这个问题。这样做，不但可以解决怎样在本部门贯彻把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，可以发动每一个人如何通过本身工作为基本建设服务，同时也可以提高和改善本单位的工作。本报今天发表的群众报矿，就是各地群众对基本建设支援的事实，特别是“工地上的‘活邮亭’”，更是一个活的榜样。青年邮递员张道中这种为基本建设工地工人服务的精神和做法，值得我们很好地学习。希望各方面的干部和群众想出各种办法来主动地配合和支援基本建设的工人同志，想很多方法来鼓舞和慰问他们。
    至于各基本建设单位的领导同志，却不能坐着等待各方面的支援，而应积极地尽一切办法来争取各方面的支援。更不能以暂时得不到各方面的某些支援，而忽视工人群众各种迫切的要求，应该很好地关心工人群众的各种切身利益，深入工地教育和组织工人用自己的力量解决自己的问题。如适当改善工人的住宿、伙食，照顾工人的休息，都是急需做而且能够做到的；又如对医药条件的改善，虽是比较难以马上做到的问题，但是教育和组织工人如何进行安全生产，防止伤亡事故也是完全可以做到的。在各种基本建设工程中的工人同志，也应主动地想出很多方法来争取各方面的配合和支援，想出各种方法发挥自己的力量，来尽可能地解决自己的问题。
    希望在各种基本建设工程中的干部和工人同志多多给我们来信，提出你们对各方面的要求和意见，介绍你们如何努力工作的情况。希望各方面的大小部门多多写信给我们，报告你们如何进行或者如何准备进行配合基本建设工作。希望各方面的干部和群众多多给我们来信，谈谈你究竟打算如何为祖国的基本建设服务。希望大家都来配合和支援，保证更好更快地进行祖国大规模的基本建设。
