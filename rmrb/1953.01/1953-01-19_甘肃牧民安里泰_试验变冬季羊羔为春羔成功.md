Gansu Herdsman An Lintai
Successfully Experiments with Changing Winter Lambs into Spring Lambs
Gansu Jiuquan County Qiming District Salar Uyghur herdsman An Lintai has successfully experimented with delaying the lambing season for sheep, changing winter lambs into spring lambs, greatly increasing the sheep's reproduction rate. An Lintai's method of changing sheep from winter lambing to spring lambing is as follows: in the fifth month of the lunar calendar of the previous year, when ewes begin to estrus, separate the rams and ewes into separate pens and graze them separately to avoid mating. Then, in September and October, reunite them for mating. This pushes the ewe's lambing period from around the first month of the lunar calendar to the third month. The benefits of this change are: first, the weather is warmer in spring, and neither ewes nor lambs will freeze to death; second, ewes have green grass to eat, are well-nourished, and produce more milk, allowing the lambs to eat sufficient milk and green grass, making both ewes and lambs fat and strong; third, controlling the mating season of rams and ewes allows the ewes to conceive and lamb simultaneously, allowing shepherds to concentrate on lambing and improving the feeding and management of ewes and lambs.
An Lintai is an experienced sheep herder with rich sheep raising experience. After he changed the lambing season of his sheep, the survival rate of his lambs reached 95% last year. His flock has developed extremely rapidly, with a sheep breeding rate of 48% and a goat breeding rate of 42% last year.
In the past, the lambing season for sheep in the Northwest region was mostly around the first month of the lunar calendar, which is when it is icy and snowy and the pasture is withered. The ewes are thin and produce little milk, so a large number of lambs die each year, with a survival rate of only about 60%. Over the past three years, governments at all levels in the Northwest have mobilized herdsmen to store grass and repair pens, which has greatly reduced the lamb mortality rate at the turn of winter and spring. Now, An Lintai's successful experience in changing winter lambs into spring lambs has provided a very good method for the large-scale reproduction of sheep in the Northwest region. The Animal Husbandry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee has now instructed all localities to vigorously promote An Lintai's experience based on their different circumstances.

    甘肃牧民安里泰
    试验变冬季羊羔为春羔成功
    甘肃酒泉县祁明区撒里维吾尔族牧民安里泰进行延迟羊只产羔季节，改冬羔为春羔的试验已获成功，大大提高了羊只的繁殖率。安里泰改变羊只冬季产羔为春季产羔的办法是：在头一年农历五月母羊开始发情时，把公羊和母羊分群圈养、分群放牧，避免交配。到九、十月间再合群交配。这样，就把母羊的产羔期由农历的正月前后推迟到三月间。这样改变的好处是：一、春天天气暖和，不会冻死母羊和羊羔；二、母羊有青草吃、营养好、奶多，羊羔能吃到充足的奶和青草，使母羊和羊羔体肥健壮；三、控制公羊、母羊的交配季节，可以使母羊能同时受孕，同时产羔，牧羊人因而就能集中精力做好接羔工作，并能改善母羊和羊羔的饲养管理。
    安里泰是一个养羊老手，他有丰富的养羊经验。当他改变了羊只的产羔季节后，去年他的羊羔的成活率就达百分之九十五。他的羊群发展极快，去年绵羊繁殖率达百分之四十八，山羊繁殖率达百分之四十二。
    西北地区过去羊只的产羔季节多在农历正月前后，正是冰天雪地、牧草枯萎的时候，母羊体瘦奶少，所以每年羊羔大量死亡，成活率仅百分之六十左右。三年来，西北各级人民政府发动牧民储草、修圈，已使冬春之交羊羔死亡率大大减少。现在，安里泰改冬羔为春羔的成功经验，又给西北地区羊只的大量繁殖提供了很好方法。西北军政委员会畜牧部现已指示各地，要求各地根据不同情况，大力推广安里泰的经验。（新华社）
