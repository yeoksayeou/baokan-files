Editor's Note: Grassroots mediation work is the people, under the leadership of the government, resolving their internal disputes themselves. It is the people using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to conduct self-education. It is an effective way for the people's courts to handle cases by relying on the masses. As this judicial reform movement enters the construction phase, grassroots mediation work has played a significant role in clearing a large number of backlog cases, further enabling judicial personnel to recognize this as an effective step towards making judicial work mass-based and democratic. This article systematically introduces the characteristics of this work and the deviations that should be corrected at present, hoping to attract the attention of readers, especially judicial cadres.

Strengthen Mediation Work, Realize Mass Participation in Judicial Work
Ren Jianxin, Xiao Yinghua

(I)
The People's Government has always attached great importance to mediation work for resolving people's disputes. In the old liberated areas in the past, such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, mediation committees were generally established. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government formulated the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Civil and Criminal Mediation Regulations." In 1949, the North China People's Government further summarized the experience of mediation work in the liberated areas and issued the "Decision on Mediation of Civil Disputes," establishing mediation committees throughout North China. Generally, more than 70% of disputes among the people were resolved through mediation. Later, due to insufficient leadership in mediation work in various places, impure organizations in some mediation committees, and mandatory command-style in mediation, many mediation committees collapsed or became ineffective.

Since the launch of the judicial reform movement last year, judicial workers in many regions have re-recognized the importance of mediation work in practice. Especially as the movement entered the construction phase and people's courts in various places began to clear backlog cases, they felt that carrying out mediation work was an effective way for the courts to handle cases by relying on the masses. As a result, many places re-established or improved the organization of mediation committees and launched mass mediation activities.

(II)
Under the leadership of the People's Government and the People's Courts, mediation committees in various places, relying on the masses, effectively resolved many disputes among the people by using individual mediation, collective mediation (cities), joint village mediation (rural areas), and the method of combining mediation and trial, and played a significant role in the construction of people's judicial system.

Relying on the masses to mediate cases can first of all make case handling fast and correct, and deal with a large number of cases in a short period. All 107 disputes in Chuandi Village, the first district of Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, were reasonably resolved within one month in 1949. In 1951, Fujian Province accepted a total of 5,804 cases, of which 5,658 cases were resolved using mediation methods. Cases resolved through mediation were felt by the parties concerned and the masses to be reasonable. During the judicial reform movement, many cases that the courts had been unable to resolve for a long time were also resolved through mediation. For example, the field boundary dispute of Xu Tingru in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, which had been in litigation for more than 60 years without being resolved, was successfully mediated in just half a day during the judicial reform movement. Therefore, relying on the masses to mediate cases can not only save the people's manpower, financial resources, and time, and reduce the people's suffering from litigation, but also enable the people's courts to free themselves from bureaucratic work methods. In many places, after the people's courts established mediation organizations among the masses, the number of cases accepted was greatly reduced. For example, before September last year, the Weifang City People's Court in Shandong Province accepted an average of 66 civil cases and 33 criminal cases per month; after the establishment of mediation groups, in September, it only received 39 civil cases and 12 criminal cases. The number of cases accepted by the People's Courts of Panshi County in Jilin Province and Xichang County in Xikang Province was also reduced by half after the establishment of mediation organizations. Mediation work also played a role in preventing disputes and preventing crime. Guo Meiqing, a female mediator in Weifang City, Shandong Province, discovered that a woman, Xu Li, was about to commit suicide because she could not bear her husband's abuse. She immediately educated her on the Marriage Law, stopped the suicide, and helped her get a divorce. The mediation group in Weifang City combined specific cases to educate the masses on the Marriage Law, causing the parents-in-law and husbands of the original 19 families who abused women to change their ways and preventing criminal behavior. Due to the development of mediation work, the People's Courts reversed the busy and passive situation of accumulating cases and dissatisfaction from all parties, and were able to free up time and energy to deal with more important cases, effectively suppressing enemies and punishing serious criminal behavior.

The second role of mediation work is to strengthen the unity of the people and encourage the masses' enthusiasm for production. Under the active activities of mediation committees in various places, the masses changed their thinking of "a lawsuit causes ten years of hatred." Their awareness has been raised. Many parties concerned, after mediation, eliminated their emotional disputes and reconciled. Chen Qingchang, the plaintiff in the dispute between the Chen brothers in Xinxiang City, Henan Province, said to the defendant after mediation: "I understand, this is an internal problem of the people, and we are brothers. I am willing to let you live in the house for another ten years." The mediation committee of Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, gradually reduced the number of disputes after mediating more than 100 cases in 1949. In 1950, there were 21 disputes, which decreased to 9 in 1951, and only 3 in the first half of 1952, significantly enhancing the unity of the people. Therefore, after the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative in the village in the spring of 1951, the advanced production organization, coupled with the unity of the members, increased production year by year. Production increased by 17% in 1950 compared to 1949, 12.6% in 1951 compared to 1950, and another 64% in 1952 compared to 1951. The masses said with satisfaction: "There are fewer disputes year by year, and more grain year by year."

The third role of mediation work is to enhance the prestige of the People's Courts and strengthen the connection between the courts and the masses. Before the judicial reform movement, due to the serious old legal viewpoints and old judicial style existing in many courts, the people in many places were not satisfied with the courts, and even regarded the courts as old "yamens" (feudal government offices). After judicial reform and the widespread development of mediation work, the courts went deep into the districts and villages to handle cases by relying on the masses, and the people changed their past perceptions, began to regard judicial work as their own cause, and took the initiative to contact the People's Courts. Some farmers in Panshi County, Jilin Province, also inquired about things at the court when they went to the city to buy things.

The fourth role of mediation work is to educate cadres and the broad masses. Court cadres have universally recognized the power and wisdom of the masses from practice and strengthened their confidence in following the mass line. For example, in the fourth district of Yongchun County, Fujian Province, six cadres relied on the mediation committee to close 163 cases in nine days, while five cadres in the fifth district used the method of "running errands to inquire about cases" and only closed 27 cases in eleven days. This is a very profound education for those cadres who do not believe in the power of the masses. Street and village cadres and mediation committee members have also generally improved their policy level and working ability through training and practical exercise. As a result of the mediation committee relying on the masses and striving to serve the people, the prestige of the mediation committee itself has been greatly enhanced. When the masses have problems, they run to the mediation committee, which also further encourages the working enthusiasm of the mediation committee members. Many touching examples have emerged in various places. Zhao Lanyun, an old woman in Nanjing City and a family member of a soldier, is a mediation committee member. Although she has heart disease, she still works until late at night every day and refuses to rest. When collective mediation began in urban areas of Beijing, some citizens asked, "Can you really use our strength?" When they were absorbed into the mediation work, they believed it and were very active. An old woman mediated seven cases in half a day by herself. Not only the mediation committee members are like this, but also the masses. Many activists in Wuhan City sometimes put down their own family affairs to do mediation work. Many farmers in Tongnan Township, Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, braved the rain and waded through the water to participate in mediation work. After being educated, the parties concerned and the masses have also generally raised their class consciousness.

People's Courts in various places generally rely on mediation committee members and activists among the masses to carry out mediation work, and also absorb relevant departments involved in the case to participate in mediation work. The steps of mediation are to first analyze the case, then convene a meeting of the parties concerned and the masses to make an enlightening report, emphasizing the use of democratic persuasion to resolve internal disputes among the people, and repeatedly conduct education on unity and production, criticizing "fighting for face" and other erroneous ideas, explaining policies in detail and proposing methods for resolving disputes, and then mobilizing the masses to conduct mediation. At this time, the masses will help the parties concerned to solve the problem fairly and reasonably. Because the mediation committee members and the masses are most familiar with the case and the minds of the parties concerned, the solutions they propose are also most relevant and can persuade the parties concerned more effectively than the court cadres. Experience in various places has proved that as long as the preparatory work is done well, policies are explained repeatedly, and thorough ideological education is carried out, many disputes caused by a lack of understanding of policies and by emotional conflict can be resolved through self-reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, it will be submitted to the group meeting for deliberation, which will be controlled by the mediation committee members. At the group meeting, individual dishonest parties concerned are also more honest under everyone's criticism. If some cases still cannot be deliberated, because the case has been clarified, it is easy to make a judgment. Such reconciliation and deliberation are a profound and powerful education for both the parties concerned and the masses. Some parties concerned in Beijing, Nanjing, Baotou and other places actively participated in mediation after their disputes were resolved, and even "spoke from their own experience." Some visiting masses also took the initiative to participate in mediation to persuade the parties concerned.

(III)
The mediation committee is an organizational form for the people to resolve their own internal disputes under the leadership of the government. It is one of the best forms for the people to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to conduct self-education. It is a powerful assistant to the people's judicial organs and a bridge for the people's courts to maintain close contact with the masses. Therefore, its activities are also an important part of the people's democratic life. According to the existing experience in various places, the tasks of the mediation committee should be: to mediate general civil and minor criminal disputes among the people; to assist the People's Courts in conducting investigations and studies on relevant cases; and to conduct propaganda and education on policies and laws to the broad masses through their own work, in order to eliminate and prevent the occurrence of crimes and disputes. The organization of the mediation committee should widely absorb mass activists with clear positions, upright style, and close ties with the masses, and should pay attention to absorbing activists among women and representatives of ethnic minorities. The working principle of the mediation committee should be: according to the provisions of policies and laws, combined with the actual circumstances of the case, in accordance with the principle of democracy and voluntariness, to fairly and reasonably mediate disputes among the people, so as to enhance unity and be conducive to the development of production. In order to strengthen the work of the mediation committee, some necessary working systems should also be established. And the most important thing is to strengthen leadership. In addition to the Party and government leading organs paying attention to mediation work, specific leadership should be one of the important tasks of the People's Courts at all levels.

At present, the main shortcomings and deviations in mediation work are three: First, there is still some commandism. Some mediation committee members violate the principle of voluntariness of the parties concerned when conducting mediation, forming mandatory mediation, and even arbitrarily making decisions to punish the parties concerned, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, Li Peizu and Li Hangong in Beiyuan Township, Gaishan District, Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, reported to the township people's government that their neighbors Li Chundi and others had stolen their lotus roots. The mediation committee did not investigate the matter clearly and arbitrarily decided to fine Li Chundi for guarding the lotus root field for seven nights, and stipulated that Li Chundi would be responsible if another theft was discovered. This practice that violated the policy was corrected after being discovered by the district people's government. Some mediation committee members also regard themselves as "judges" and said to the parties concerned: "If you do not accept mediation, we will hold a mass meeting to resolve it." The parties concerned are very dissatisfied with this. These are all wrong. Second, mediation is not carried out in accordance with policies and laws, forming unprincipled "conciliationism." Some court cadres and mediation committee members mistakenly believe that the mass line of trial is to hand over all cases to the masses for mediation, without distinguishing the nature and circumstances of the cases for different handling; or they only see that the cases belong to internal disputes of the people, but do not see that some of the cases are illegal and criminal facts that infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of the people and undermine the country's construction cause. They implement "persuasion to reconcile but not to divorce" for all marriage disputes; for cases in which illegal capitalists seriously steal state property and infringe on workers' rights, they also advise the complainants to make concessions in the attitude of "peacemakers" in order to seek "reconciliation." This is also wrong. Third, there is a lack of regular leadership. Some places blindly establish mediation organizations, but have not yet started work, forming a nominal existence. Some mediation committees have died out on their own due to lack of leadership and assistance after their establishment. The practice of making the mediation committee "heatedly" during the clearing of backlog cases and then putting it aside after the clearing of backlog cases must be corrected.

(IV)
Strengthening mediation work is one of the effective steps to realize the mass participation and democratization of judicial work. It can not only solve and prevent disputes among the people in a timely manner, enhance the unity of the people, but also widely absorb the people to participate in judicial activities (a part of state management work), and enlighten and guide the masses to fight against illegal and undisciplined behavior. Lenin said in his article "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Government": "Our goal is to absorb all the poor people to participate in management work, and all the steps to achieve this goal--the more forms the better--should be registered in detail, studied, systematized, reviewed with more extensive experience, and set as regulations." The mediation committee is one of these forms. Therefore, establishing and improving the mediation organization, strengthening the leadership of mediation work, and giving full play to the role of mediation work have become an important link in the current construction of the people's judicial system. The People's judicial organs at all levels should complete this work as an important task.

专栏：

    编者按：民间调解工作，是人民群众在政府领导下自己解决自己内部纠纷的工作，是人民群众用批评与自我批评的武器进行自我教育的工作，是人民法院依靠群众办案的有效办法。在这次司法改革运动进入建设阶段时，在清理大批积案中，民间调解工作更发挥了极大的作用，更使司法人员认识了这是使司法工作群众化、民主化的有效步骤。这篇文章比较系统地介绍了这一工作的特点和目前应注意纠正的偏向，希望能引起读者特别是司法干部的注意。
    加强调解工作，实现司法群众化
    任健新  萧英华
    （一）
    人民政府对于解决人民纠纷的调解工作一向是十分重视的。过去在老解放区，如陕甘宁边区、晋察冀边区、晋冀鲁豫边区，都曾普遍建立调解委员会。陕甘宁边区政府曾制订了“陕甘宁边区民刑事调解条例”。一九四九年华北人民政府又进一步总结了解放区调解工作的经验，发布了“关于调解民间纠纷的决定”，在华北全区普遍建立了调解委员会。人民间的纠纷因调解而解决的，一般占全部案件的百分之七十以上。后来，由于各地对调解工作领导不够，一部分调解委员会组织不纯，调解中有强迫命令作风等，而使许多调解委员会垮台或不起作用。
    去年司法改革运动开展以来，许多地区的司法工作人员在实践中重新认识了调解工作的重要性。特别是在运动进入建设阶段、各地人民法院开始清理积案后，更感到开展调解工作是法院依靠群众办案的有效办法，因而有不少地方重新建立或健全了调解委员会的组织，展开了群众性的调解活动。
    （二）
    各地调解委员会在人民政府和人民法院的领导下，依靠群众，运用个别调解、集体调解（城市）、联村调解（农村）以及调解与审判相结合的办法，有效地解决了人民之间的许多纠纷，在人民司法建设工作中发挥了很大的作用。
    依靠群众调解案件，首先是能使办案迅速而正确，在短期间大量处理案件。山西省平顺县第一区川底村的一百零七件纠纷，在一九四九年一个月之内便完全得到合理解决。福建省在一九五一年共收案五千八百零四件，使用调解办法解决的有五千六百五十八件。司法改革运动中清理积案时，华北地区调解成功的案件占全部案件的百分之七十以上；华东占百分之九十以上，共十二万五千一百九十六件。经过调解解决的案件，当事人以及群众都感到合情合理。在司法改革运动中，许多法院长久不能解决的案件，经过调解也解决了。如江苏省江阴县徐廷如的田基纠纷，过去打了六十多年的官司没有得到解决，在司法改革运动中，仅在半天内就调解成功。因此，依靠群众调解案件的办法，不但能节省人民群众的人力、财力和时间，减少人民诉讼的痛苦，而且能使人民法院从事务主义的工作方法中解脱出来。很多地方的人民法院在群众中建立了调解组织之后，收案就大大减少。如山东省潍坊市人民法院去年九月份以前，平均每月受理民事案件六十六件，刑事案件三十三件；建立调解小组后，九月份只收到民事案件三十九件，刑事案件十二件。吉林省磐石县、西康省西昌县人民法院在建立调解组织后，收案也减少了一半。调解工作并起了预防纠纷和防止犯罪的作用。山东潍坊市女调解员郭美卿，发觉妇女徐李氏因不堪丈夫虐待准备自杀，立即对她进行婚姻法教育，制止了自杀，并帮助她离了婚。潍坊市的调解小组结合具体事例对群众进行婚姻法的教育，使原来虐待妇女的十九个家庭的公婆丈夫转变过来，防止了犯罪行为。由于调解工作的开展，人民法院扭转了积案累累、各方不满的忙乱被动状况，能够抽出时间和力量处理更重要的案件，有效地镇压敌人和惩罚严重的犯罪行为。
    调解工作的第二个作用是加强人民内部的团结，鼓舞群众的生产热情。各地在调解委员会的积极活动下，群众改变了“一场官司十年仇”的思想。提高了觉悟。有不少当事人经过调解，消除了意气之争，言归于好。河南新乡市陈家兄弟争房纠纷，经调解之后，原告陈庆昌对被告说：“我通了，这是人民内部问题，咱们又是亲兄弟，我情愿把房子让你再住十年。”山西省平顺县川底村的调解委员会在一九四九年调解了一百多件案子之后，纠纷逐渐减少。一九五零年发生二十一件纠纷，一九五一年减少到九件，一九五二年上半年只有三件，显著地增进了人民内部的团结。因此一九五一年春该村成立农业生产合作社后，先进的生产组织加上社员之间的团结一致，生产逐年提高。一九五零年比一九四九年增产百分之十七，一九五一年比一九五零年增产百分之十二点六，一九五二年又比一九五一年增产百分之六十四。群众满意地说：“纠纷一年比一年少，粮食一年比一年多。”
    调解工作的第三个作用是提高了人民法院的威信，密切了法院和人民群众的联系。在司法改革运动以前，由于许多法院存在着严重的旧法观点和旧司法作风，不少地方的人民群众对于法院是不够满意的，甚至把法院看成旧“衙门”。经过司法改革，普遍开展调解工作，法院深入区村依靠群众办案以后，人民群众改变了过去的认识，开始把司法工作看成自己的事业，并主动地和人民法院联系。吉林省磐石县有的农民进城买东西，也顺便到法院打听事情。
    调解工作的第四个作用是教育了干部和广大群众。法院干部都普遍地从实践中认识了群众的力量和智慧，坚定了走群众路线的信心。如福建省永春县第四区六个干部依靠调解委员会九天结案一百六十三件，第五区五个干部用“跑腿问案”的办法，十一天只结案二十七件。这对于那些不相信群众力量的干部是一个非常深刻的教育。街、村干部和调解委员经过培养和实际的锻炼，也普遍提高了政策水平和工作能力。由于调解委员会依靠群众，努力为人民群众服务的结果，调解委员会本身的威信大大提高了。群众一有事就跑去找调解委员会，因此也更加鼓舞了调解委员们的工作积极性。各地都涌现出许多动人的事例。南京市军属赵兰韵老太太，是个调解委员，她虽有心脏病，仍每天工作到深夜，不肯休息。北京市区开始实行集体调解时，有些市民问：“你们真能用我们的力量吗？”及至吸收他们参加调解工作后，他们相信了，并且非常积极。有一位老太太一个人在半天内调解了七个案子。不但调解委员如此，群众也如此。武汉市很多积极分子有时放下自己家里的事去做调解工作。江苏省海门县同南乡很多农民冒雨涉水去参加调解工作。当事人和群众受到教育后，也普遍提高了阶级觉悟。
    各地人民法院进行调解工作，一般是依靠调解委员和群众中的积极分子，并吸收与案件有关的部门参加调解工作。调解的步骤，是首先分析案情，然后召开当事人及群众会议作启发报告，强调用民主说服的方式解决人民内部纠纷，并反复进行团结生产的教育，批判“争气”及其他的错误思想，详细交代政策和提出解决纠纷的方法，再发动群众进行调解。这时，群众就会帮助当事人公平合理地解决问题。由于调解委员和群众最熟悉案情和当事人的心思，他们提出的解决办法，也最能切中要害，比法院干部更能说服当事人。各地经验证明，只要准备工作做得好，反复讲明政策，进行充分的思想教育，就可以使许多因为不了解政策和为斗气而发生的纠纷自行和解。和解不成的再交由小组会进行评议，由调解委员掌握。在小组会上，个别不老实的当事人在大家的批评之下，也比较老实了。如仍有一些案件评议不成，因为案情已弄明，也容易判决了。这样的和解和评议，对于当事人和群众都是一个深刻而有力的教育。北京、南京、包头等地有些当事人在自己的纠纷得到解决后，还“现身说法”，积极参加调解。有些参观的群众也主动参加调解来说服当事人。
    （三）
    调解委员会是人民群众在政府领导下自己解决自己内部纠纷的组织形式，是人民群众运用批评与自我批评武器进行自我教育的最好的形式之一，是人民司法机关的有力助手，是人民法院密切联系群众的桥梁。因此，它的活动也是人民民主生活中的一个重要部分。根据各地已有的经验，调解委员会的任务应该是：调解人民内部一般民事与轻微的刑事纠纷；协助人民法院进行有关案件的调查研究；并通过自己的工作向广大群众进行政策法令的宣传教育，以消除与防止犯罪和纠纷事件的发生。调解委员会的组织应广泛吸收立场明确、作风正派、与群众有密切联系的群众积极分子参加，并应注意吸收妇女中的积极分子及少数民族的代表参加。调解委员会的工作原则应该是：根据政策法令的规定，结合案件的实际情况，依照民主自愿的原则，公平合理地调解人民之间的纠纷，藉以增进团结，有利于发展生产。为加强调解委员会的工作，还应建立一些必要的工作制度。而最重要的则是加强领导。除党政领导机关应重视调解工作外，具体领导应是各级人民法院的重要任务之一。
    目前调解工作中的主要缺点和偏向有三：一是还有一些强迫命令作风。有些调解委员在进行调解时违反了当事人自愿的原则，形成强制调解，甚至擅自作出处分当事人的决定，引起群众不满。如福建省福州盖山区北园乡李培祖、李汗宫向乡人民政府报告，说他们的邻居李春弟等三人偷了他们的藕，调解委员会没有把事情调查清楚，便擅自决定罚李春弟看守藕田七夜，并规定如再发现被窃情事，由李春弟负责。这一违犯政策的作法被区人民政府发觉后，才得到纠正。还有的调解委员以“法官”自居，向当事人说：“你如不接受调解，开群众大会来解决。”当事人对此很不满意。这些都是错误的。二是不按照政策法令进行调解，形成无原则的“调和主义”。有些法院干部和调解委员错误地认为群众路线的审判方式就是把一切案件都交给群众调解，而不分别案件的性质和情况进行不同的处理；或只看到案件是属于人民内部的纠纷，而看不到其中有些案件是侵害人民合法权益和破坏国家建设事业的违法犯罪事实。他们对一切婚姻纠纷实行“劝和不劝离”；对不法资本家严重盗窃国家资财和侵害工人权利的案件，也以“和事佬”的态度劝告控诉人让步，以求“和解”。这也是错误的。三是缺乏经常的领导。有的地方盲目建立调解组织，但至今尚未展开工作，形成有名无实。有的调解委员会成立后，因缺乏领导与帮助而自生自灭。那种清理积案时把调解委员会搞得“热火朝天”，清理积案后就搁置不管的做法，必须纠正。
    （四）
    加强调解工作是实现司法群众化、民主化的有效步骤之一。它不但能够及时地解决与预防人民之间的纠纷，增进人民内部的团结，而且可以广泛吸收人民群众参加司法活动（国家管理工作的一部分），启发引导群众向违法乱纪行为作斗争。列宁在“苏维埃政权底当前任务”一文中曾说：“我们的目的，是要吸收全体贫民来参加管理工作，而实现这个目的的一切步骤，——其形式愈多愈好，——应该详细地登记起来，加以研究，使之系统化，以更广泛的经验来从事审查，并定为法规。”调解委员会正是这种形式之一。因此，建立与健全调解组织，加强对于调解工作的领导，充分发挥调解工作的作用，就成为目前人民司法建设工作中的一个重要环节。各级人民司法机关应该把这件工作做为一项重要任务来完成。
