Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: The Korean and Chinese People's Forces continue to inflict casualties on the enemy on the snow-swept front lines. On the Eastern Front, our forces launched five consecutive attacks over three nights, annihilating over 300 enemy troops. On the night of the 11th, an assault team dispatched by our forces stealthily approached the position of a puppet army company entrenched on a high ground east of Changcheng-ri. Our artillery also simultaneously shelled the enemy's position. As soon as the artillery barrage ceased, the assault team, reaching the vicinity of the enemy's position, stormed into it. After half an hour of combat, they annihilated the majority of a company of the recently deployed Lee pseudo-army 12th Division, totaling 154 men. On the nights of the 12th and 13th, our forces separately raided four enemy positions near Bianyan-ri and Wendeng-ri, completely annihilating a platoon and four squads, and partially annihilating a platoon and two squads of the Lee pseudo-army, totaling over 150 men.

On the Western Front, in the first five days of mid-January, our forces, in addition to small-scale ambushes and raids, also repelled several enemy harassments, eliminating nearly 100 enemies. These counter-harassment battles mostly lasted no more than fifteen minutes before the enemy was driven back. The largest enemy harassment occurred before dawn on the 12th, when two reinforced platoons of the U.S. 7th Division launched three consecutive attacks on the forward positions of our army near Wuliting, five miles northwest of Tieyuan. After suffering over 40 casualties, they fled back.

In the five days from January 11th to 15th, our mobile artillery fire killed or wounded over 400 enemy troops, and our frontline anti-aircraft fire shot down four enemy aircraft and damaged ten.

    朝中人民部队五天歼灭敌军八百多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】朝中人民部队在风雪弥漫的战线上继续杀伤敌人。东线我军在三个晚上连续出击五次，歼灭敌军三百多名。十一日晚上，我军派出的一支袭击队隐蔽地向踞守在长承里以东一处高地上的一个伪军连的阵地摸去。我军炮火也同时向敌军阵地进行轰击。当炮火轰击刚停时，到达敌军阵地附近的袭击队就突入敌人阵地，经半小时战斗，歼灭最近被调到前线上来的李伪军第十二师的一个连的大部，共一百五十四人。十二、十三两日夜晚，我军分别袭入边岩里，文登里附近的四个敌军阵地，共歼灭李伪军一个排、四个班的全部和一个排、两个班的一部，共一百五十多名。
    西线我军在一月中旬的前五天除进行小型的伏击、袭击战以外，还击退了敌人数次袭扰，歼敌近一百名。这些反袭扰战斗大都不超过十五分钟，便将敌人击退。敌人最大的一次袭扰是在十二日天明以前，美军第七师的两个加强排向铁原西北五里亭附近我军的前沿阵地连续攻击三次，被我杀伤四十多人后逃回。
    一月十一日到十五日的五天中，前线我军游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军四百多名，前线高射炮火击落敌机四架，击伤敌机十架。
