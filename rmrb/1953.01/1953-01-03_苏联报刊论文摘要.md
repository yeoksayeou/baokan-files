    Striving for Economy and Thrift
    The "Pravda" published an editorial on December 20, 1952, pointing out the importance of economy in socialist production. The abstract is as follows:

    Socialist society is essentially the most thrifty. Economical use of public wealth will accelerate our progress towards communism.

    The party of Lenin and Stalin has always paid great attention to implementing the most rigorous economy, regarding thrift as the most important condition for creating capital accumulation and correctly utilizing accumulated funds.

    The Soviet state's industry possesses enormous power. By better utilizing these forces and adopting the most advanced production methods, the same machines can produce far more products. However, we have not fully utilized our machinery. The production capacity of many industrial sectors is not well utilized. Many factories have suffered huge losses due to poor management and waste of materials, raw materials, fuel, electricity, and other valuable resources. At the same time, the amount of waste products in production remains large. For example, at the "Crane" factory of the Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Department, the losses incurred this year due to waste products and non-productive expenses have doubled compared to last year.

    Facts show that many leaders have forgotten about thrift and have not given sufficient attention to correct management and reducing administrative expenses. The current task is to strengthen the struggle for economy and thrift in all sectors of the national economy.

    The struggle for economy and thrift is not a short-term movement but a constant method of managing the economy inherent in socialism.

    Correct leadership of production and wise management require all our cadres to deeply study objective economic laws and use them to benefit society.

    The responsibility of party organizations and all party and Soviet newspapers is to direct the fire of criticism and self-criticism at the complacency and self-satisfaction of leaders who have forgotten about thrift, and at various cases of waste and mismanagement. In the nationwide socialist competition to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan, every worker must be educated to have a high sense of responsibility for public wealth and socialist property.

    Freudianism Serves the Bourgeois Reactionaries
    The Soviet "Medical Worker's Newspaper" of October 24, 1952, published an article by Banshkov-Bortnov, criticizing the prevalence of Freudian thought currently popular in the United States and the poison it spreads. The abstract is as follows:

    Freud's theory occupies an important position among the theories used as weapons by American imperialism. Freudianism, along with pragmatic "philosophy," spiritualism, or astrology, strives to deny rational scientific understanding of the laws of nature and leads people into the dark abyss of mysticism.

    The main purpose of the gang of ideological lackeys of American imperialism is to obliterate the objective laws of natural and social development by all means, and to prove that progress, especially the transformation of nature and society, is impossible.

    The ideological source of Freudianism is idealist philosophy. The German idealist Eduard Hartmann was the inspirer of this thought. As early as the 1850s, Hartmann used his "philosophy of the unconscious" to oppose Darwinism.

    Exported from Europe, Freud's theory has taken deep root in American sociology, art, psychology, anthropology, and especially medicine. Freud's book "The Interpretation of Dreams" - which discusses the role of sexual experiences in spiritual life and expresses his "doctrine" of the unconscious - is well suited to the tastes of scientific rogues and those who degrade the human soul.

    Appearing during the crisis of bourgeois natural science, Freudianism uses sermons to refute scientific and materialistic explanations of natural and social phenomena. The complexity of all human psychological activity is reduced to the doctrine of the unconscious, to obscure, profound feelings, instincts, and preferences. According to Freud, there is constant struggle in the human psyche between consciousness and the unconscious, between the principle of satisfying desires and the principle of reality. Unfulfilled desires and animal instincts merge, expanding the realm of the subconscious. This subconscious, according to Freud, cannot be explained by any physiological analysis. Freud believes that these base instincts and preferences not only restrain individuals but also determine the actions of societies and nations, driving groups.

    Freudianism does not recognize the objectivity of the world and denies the connection between phenomena. It asserts that economic factors play no role in human relationships, and only the "unconscious" has the right to determine such relationships. Freud's followers even use psychoanalysis to "eliminate" all class, national, and religious contradictions.

    All these absurd ideas are naturally the most convenient tools for warmongers. That is why Freud's modern followers boast about this idea with ecstatic hearts.

    The British philosopher Bertrand Russell, who bases his worldview on Freudianism and Weismannism, asserts that human behavior is genetically determined by a number of restrictive and immutable instincts of hunger, lust, and aggression. The terrible product of the capitalist system - predatory war - can, in Russell's opinion, satisfy the demands of the aggressive instinct and should therefore be regarded as a positive phenomenon.

    The doctrine of the unconscious, of abnormal psychology, and of repressing unsatisfied sexual desires in the subconscious - all of these in the United States and other capitalist countries, have left a great imprint not only in many branches of psychiatry. With the full support and encouragement of the American ruling groups, Freudianism has become the main method in all so-called mental therapies.

    Freud's followers spare no effort to find a basis for the immovability and legitimacy of the imperialist system, for the exploitation of the working people, and for predatory wars. For example, a Mr. Monte asserted in the American "Clinical Psychiatry" magazine that all natural phenomena, from the universe to the atom, can be explained by the relationship between two origins - positive and negative. According to this Freudian, the whole world is permeated by a special energy of bisexual demand, which is the driving force behind the formation of families and the universe, atomic changes, and historical events.

    We cannot help but ask, what contribution have Freudians made to medicine and its practice?

    Freudianism first abolished the pathological system in medicine. This is particularly evident in the understanding of "psychosis" and "neurosis." From the clinical symptoms of numerous nerve and psychological disorders, they can only distinguish residual phenomena and symptomatic processes and attempts at recovery. At the same time, attempts to recover are also considered a phenomenon that can lead to conflicts with the surrounding environment, and therefore are also identified as a disease.

    Psychoanalytic studies of mental and many physical illnesses, in addition to causing confusion and distortion in diagnostics, can make no contribution, cannot lead to and will not create truly effective treatment.

    Modern psychoanalysts deny the principles of causal and pathogenic treatment based on a scientific understanding of the functional processes of human organs. They violently oppose progressive physiology. For example, the American "Psychotherapy" magazine constantly opposes Freud's idealist views to Pavlov's materialist theory.

    Pavlov's theory affirms the material conditioning of psychological processes, pointing out that mental activity as a function of the brain cannot exist apart from matter. All psychological processes, no matter how complex, are constrained by the various influences of the internal and external environment on the brain. Psychological processes are incomprehensible without certain conditions regarding temporary connections and the reflex mechanisms on which they are based, as brilliantly demonstrated in Pavlov's theory.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    为厉行节约而斗争
    “真理报”一九五二年十二月二十日发表社论，指出节约在社会主义生产中的重要性。摘要如下：
    社会主义社会本质上就是最节俭的。节约地利用公共财富，会加快我们向共产主义的前进。
    列宁、斯大林的党，过去和现在一直非常注意实行最严格的节约，把厉行节约看做是创造资金积累和正确利用积累资金的最重要的条件。
    苏维埃国家的工业拥有巨大的力量。只要更好地利用它的这些力量，采取最进步的生产方法，同样的机器便可以生产多得多的产品。然而，我们对于机械还没有加以充分利用。许多工业部门的生产能力，利用得不好。许多工厂由于管理不善和浪费材料、原料、燃料、电力和其他贵重物资而造成了巨大的损失。同时，生产中的废品数量仍然是大的。例如，在重型机器制造部的“起重机”工厂，今年由于废品和非生产的开支所招致的损失，较去年扩大了一倍。
    事实说明，许多领导者忘记了节约，对于正确的管理和缩减行政费用没有给以相当的注意。目前的任务就是在国民经济各部门中加强厉行节约的斗争。
    为节约和俭省而进行斗争，不是一个短时期的运动，而是经常的、社会主义所固有的管理经济的方法。
    对生产的正确的领导，和英明的管理，要求我们全体干部深刻研究客观的经济法则，并利用它为社会谋福利。
    党组织和党的、苏维埃的一切报刊的责任，是把批评和自我批评的火力指向那些忘记了节约的领导者的宽容和自安自慰的态度，指向各种浪费和管理不善的情况。在争取完成和超额完成第五个斯大林的五年计划的全民社会主义竞赛的过程中，必须教育每个工作人员对公共财富、对社会主义财产具有高度的责任感。
    弗洛伊德主义在为资产阶级反动分子服务
    苏联一九五二年十月二十四日的“医务工作者报”发表了班什柯
    夫·鲍尔特诺夫的论文，批判目前在美国流行的弗洛伊德思想的
    盛行和它所散布的毒素。摘要如下：
    弗洛伊德的学说在美帝国主义用作武器的学理中并非占着次要的地位。弗洛伊德主义与实用主义“哲学”，唯灵论或占星学一道，竭力否认对自然规律的合理的科学认识，并把人们引向神秘论的黑暗深渊。
    美帝国主义的思想奴仆的狐群狗党们的主要目的，就是要用一切方法抹煞自然和社会发展的客观规律性，要证明进步，特别是改造自然和社会不可能。
    弗洛伊德主义的思想来源是唯心论哲学。德国唯心论者爱德华·哈特曼是这种思想的鼓舞者。早在十八世纪五十年代，这位哈特曼就用他的“无意识的哲学”和达尔文主义相对抗。
    由欧洲输出的弗洛伊德的学说，在美国的社会学、艺术学、心理学、人类学，特别是医学中已经根深蒂固了。弗洛伊德的“梦的解释”一书——这本书论述性的体验在精神生活中所起的作用，并表达他的无意识的“学说”——是很适合于科学流氓和人类灵魂堕落者的趣味的。
    在资产阶级的自然科学危机时期中出现的弗洛伊德主义，以说教来反驳对自然和社会现象的科学的唯物论的解释。人的全部心理活动的复杂性被归结到无意识的学说，归结为隐晦的、深奥的感觉、本能和爱好。根据弗洛伊德的意见，在人的心理中常进行着一种意识和无意识、满足愿望的原则和现实性原则之间的经常斗争。未能实现的愿望和动物的本能融汇起来，扩大着下意识的领域。这种下意识，依照弗洛伊德的意见，是不能用任何生理分析说明的。弗洛伊德认为这种低级的本能和爱好不仅能约束个别的人，而且能决定社会和民族的行动，推动群体。
    弗洛伊德主义不承认世界的客观性，否认现象之间的联系。它断言经济因素在人与人的关系上不起任何作用，只有“无意识”有权决定这种关系。弗洛伊德的信徒们甚至以精神分析的方法来“消除”一切阶级、民族和宗教的矛盾。
    所有这一切荒谬思想对战争贩子说来自然是最方便的工具。这就是为什么弗洛伊德的现代的信徒们要以狂喜的心情来夸耀这种思想的原因。
    以弗洛伊德主义和魏斯曼主义作为其世界观基础的英国哲学家贝特兰·罗素，断言人类的行为是遗传地为一些具有约束性的和固定不变的饥饿、性欲及侵略本能所决定。资本主义制度的可怖的产物——掠夺性战争，照罗素的意见，可以满足侵略本能的要求，因此应该把它看作肯定的现象。
    关于无意识、关于变态心理、以及关于在下意识中排斥不能满足的性的要求的学说——所有这些在美国和其他资本主义国家中，不仅是在精神病学的许多部门中留下了巨大的烙印。在美国统治集团的尽力支持和鼓励下，弗洛伊德主义已成为一切所谓精神治疗学中的主要方法。
    弗洛伊德的信徒们不顾一切地努力要为帝国主义制度、为对劳动人民的剥削，为掠夺性战争的不可动摇性和合法性找到根据。例如一位蒙特先生曾在美国“临床精神病学”杂志上断言，所有的自然现象，由宇宙以至原子，都可用两个起源——阳性和阴性——之间的关系说明。依照这位弗洛伊德主义者的意见，整个世界都为一种特别的两性的要求的精力所贯穿，这种力量就是形成家庭和宇宙，原子变化和历史事件的原动力。
    我们不禁要问，弗洛伊德主义者在医学和它的实践方面究竟做了什么贡献？
    弗洛伊德主义首先废除了医学中的病理学制度。这在对“精神病”和“神经病”的理解上表现得特别明显。他们从无数神经，心理疾患的临床症状中只能辨别残留的现象和病状过程和企图复原的现象。同时，要求复原的企图也被认为是一种会导致与周围环境发生冲突的现象，因而也被确定为一种病症。
    对精神病和肉体上的许多病症作精神分析的研究，除了给诊断学以混乱和歪曲外，不能有任何贡献，不能导致也不会创立真正的有效治疗。
    现代的精神分析论者们否认那种建立在对人体器官机能过程的科学认识上的原因治疗和病原治疗的原则。他们狂暴地反对进步的生理学。例如美国“精神治疗学”杂志便经常以弗洛伊德的唯心论观点和巴甫洛夫的唯物主义的学说相对抗。
    巴甫洛夫的学说肯定了心理过程的物质的制约性，指出作为脑髓机能的精神活动是不能脱离物质而存在的。所有的心理过程，无论它们多么复杂，都是被内外环境对大脑的各种各样的影响的作用所制约。如果没有在巴甫洛夫学说中所卓越地表明的这一种关于临时联系和作为其基础的反射机构的一定条件，心理过程是不可理解的。
