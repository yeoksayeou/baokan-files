    Everyone Should Inspect Problems in Basic Construction
    Problems in Building Material Supply
    Editor's Note: On January 8th, this column published a letter from reader Liu Shifu exposing that the Beijing Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company was selling rotten wood as good wood, thereby endangering the quality of projects. We called on the broad masses of readers to continue to inform us of such acts that harm the country's basic construction, so as to assist relevant departments in inspecting and supervising this work. After the publication of this letter, it has aroused the attention and support of the broad masses of the people. Recently, such letters have been continuously sent to the editorial department of this newspaper. Judging from these letters, this kind of incident of selling bad materials as good materials not only occurs in the Beijing area, but also widely exists in Tianjin and other areas. This phenomenon exists not only in timber, but also in other building materials such as bricks and tiles. The loss of national wealth caused by these incidents is appalling. Although these incidents occurred in 1952, the damage to the cause of basic construction is by no means limited to 1952. This year is the first year of the country's large-scale economic construction. If these bad behaviors are not eradicated in time, the losses to the country will be even more serious. We hope that the broad masses of readers will continue to expose such incidents from various aspects, such as whether there are problems in the quality and specifications of other building materials such as steel bars and cement? Is the supply timely? Is there any waste during use? And so on. Resolutely fight against behaviors that endanger the cause of basic construction and waste national wealth, and assist relevant departments in doing a good job in the supply of materials in basic construction. We hope that the Coal Construction Company will conduct a comprehensive inspection, immediately stop this bad behavior that endangers national construction, and inform this newspaper of the handling of such incidents.

    大家都来检查基本建设
    建筑器材供应中的问题
    编者按：一月八日本栏发表读者刘仕夫揭露中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司将烂木材充好木材出售以致危害工程质量的来信，并号召广大读者继续将此类为害国家基本建设的行为告诉我们，以协助有关部门来检查、监督这一工作。这封信发表以后，已引起广大人民群众的重视和支持，近来此类信件不断地寄到本报编辑部。从这些来信中看，这种以坏材充好材出售的事件，不仅发生在北京地区，天津及其他地区也普遍存在着；不仅木材中有着这种现象，其他建筑器材如砖瓦等也同样存在着这种现象。这些事件所造成的国家财富的损失是令人怵目惊心的。这些事件虽然发生在一九五二年，但其对基本建设事业的损害，则决不仅限于一九五二年。今年是国家大规模经济建设开始的一年，如果不及时根绝这些恶劣行为，给国家招致的损失就将更严重。我们希望广大读者继续从多方面来揭露此类事件，如钢筋和水泥等其他建筑器材在质量规格方面有无问题？供应是否及时？使用时有无浪费？等等。坚决和危害基本建设事业、浪费国家财富的行为作斗争，协助有关部门来做好基本建设中的器材供应工作。希望煤建公司进行全面检查，立即停止这种危害国家建设的恶劣行动，并将对此等事件处理的情况，告知本报。
