	Reading "Short Stories of Life" Collection One
	Tang Jie
	This booklet contains twelve short stories of one to two thousand words. It is the first collection of "Short Stories of Life" published in the "New Observer" magazine in 1952, and it includes illustrations. These short stories use simple and vivid language of the masses to reflect the lovable real people and real events, to reflect the real thoughts, feelings, and brand-new moral outlook of the working people of New China, and to give readers living education and living examples. In "The Story of the Mule," we see that when farmer Wang Furong heard the news that the government was buying mules and horses to support the front lines, he automatically handed over his only good mule to the country, without asking for the price. In "A Horse Cart," we see that the driver of the horse cart and Li Xiangyang led three military dependents from other places to find volunteer comrades in the middle of the night. The driver refused to accept the fare, and Li Xiangyang also took the military dependents to his home and treated them very warmly. In "A Fountain Pen," we see a young comrade named Lü Zhendong from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army who wanted a fountain pen very much in order to learn culture, but when he picked up a fountain pen, he resolutely returned it to the owner. In "Erhai's Marriage," we see Erhai helping others to rush to block the embankment at the moment before his wedding, so nervous that he simply forgot his wedding date. He is like Huang Dazhi with the red scarf in "Huang Dazhi's Notebook," Zhang Ming, the wounded soldier of the Volunteer Army in "A Red Five-pointed Star," Yue Shoushan, the old revolutionary disabled soldier in "Please Give This Jade Cup to Commander Peng," the old "Mother," Hu Da Niang in "Mother's Glory"... Their voices and smiles, their exemplary deeds, all deeply move people.
	In the short span of three years, following the profound transformation of politics and economy, the social atmosphere of New China, the material life and spiritual outlook of the people of New China have undergone fundamental changes, especially the changes in the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. People who were originally indifferent to national affairs now have ardent patriotic political enthusiasm and are willing to dedicate everything to the beloved motherland. Between the people and the government, between the people and the army, and between the people, blood-related and interconnected relationships have been established. Regardless of north or south, regardless of old or young, everyone cherishes their leaders and government, cherishes their army and military dependents, as if cherishing their own eyeballs. On all fronts, in daily life, there are exemplary deeds of mutual love and assistance, selflessness, and altruism everywhere, and the brilliance of miraculous new things shines everywhere. What these "Short Stories of Life" reflect is only a very small part of the countless new people and new things that cannot be fully told or written. However, from these short stories, can't we see the essence and direction of development of New China?
	The greatest feature of these "Short Stories of Life" lies in their high degree of authenticity. After reading one, it's like experiencing something yourself. Each one not only tells us a fresh story, but also gives us a strong sense of life, making us feel the beating of living people's hearts and smell the breath of living people.
	According to the editors of "New Observer," the authors of "Short Stories of Life" are generally the masses and grassroots cadres. They are moved by new things in their daily life and work, so moved that they have to write them down, so they write them down. The "New Observer" editorial department received nearly seven thousand such manuscripts last year and published more than sixty of them. When published, only careful revisions were made to the text, basically maintaining the true appearance of the original work.
	These "Short Stories of Life" from the masses, reflecting the new life and thoughts and feelings of the masses, have great significance and value both politically and in terms of literary creation, and should be fully valued in all aspects. These small works of one or two thousand words have been warmly loved by the broad masses of readers and have become excellent teaching materials for many cultural and literacy schools and cultural learning classes for workers, peasants, and soldiers. Let more cadres and the masses write "Short Stories of Life," let the writers who go to factories and the countryside and general literary workers also write some "Short Stories of Life," and let newspapers and magazines publish more "Short Stories of Life," because the broad masses of readers need such works.

    读“生活小故事”第一辑
    唐介
    这本小册子包含十二篇一两千字的小故事，是“新观察”杂志在一九五二年发表的“生活小故事”的第一本选辑，内有插画。这些小故事用朴素、生动的群众语言，反映了可爱的真人实事，反映了新中国劳动人民的真实思想感情和全新的道德面貌，给读者以活的教育，活的榜样。在“骡子的故事”里，我们看到农民王福荣听到政府要收买骡马支援前线的消息，就自动把自己仅有的一头好骡子交给国家，不问代价。在“一辆马车”里，我们看到赶马车的人和李向阳在深更半夜领着从外地来的三位军属找志愿军同志，这个赶马车的人拒收车钱，李向阳还把军属领到自己家里，十分亲热地款待她们。在“一支钢笔”里，我们看到志愿军某部一个名叫吕振东的小同志，为了学文化，很想有一支钢笔，但当他拾到一支钢笔的时候，又坚决地送还失主。在“二海结婚”里，我们看到二海在结婚的前刻帮助别人抢堵堤堰，紧张得简直忘记了自己的婚期。他如“黄大志的小本子”里的带红领巾的黄大志、“一颗红五星”里的志愿军伤员张明、“请将这玉盃交给彭司令员”里的老革命残废军人岳寿山、“母亲”里的老母亲、“妈妈的光荣”里的胡大娘……——他们的音容笑貌，他们的模范事迹，都叫人深深感动。
    在短短的三年中，跟着政治经济的深刻改造，新中国的社会风气，新中国人民的物质生活和精神面貌，都起了根本的变化，尤其是广大工农兵的思想感情的变化。本来对国家大事漠不关心的人，现在都有了如火如荼的爱国主义政治热情，愿意把自己的一切献给可爱的祖国。人民与政府之间，人民与军队之间，人民与人民之间，都建立了血肉相连、痛痒相关的联系。地无分南北，人无分老幼，大家都像爱护自己的眼珠子一样爱护自己的领袖和政府，爱护自己的军队和军属。在各方面战线上，在日常生活中，到处出现了互爱互助、公而忘私、舍己为人的模范事迹，到处闪耀着奇迹似的新鲜事物的光辉。这些“生活小故事”所反映的不过是说不完、写不尽的无数新人新事中的极小一部分。然而就从这些小故事里，不是也可以看出新中国的本质和发展方向了吗？
    这些“生活小故事”的最大特色就在于它们的高度真实性。你读了一篇，就像亲身经历了一件事情。每篇不仅告诉我们一个新鲜故事，而且给我们强烈的生活感，使我们感到活人的心的跳动，闻到活人的气息。
    据“新观察”的编者说，“生活小故事”的作者一般都是群众和基层干部。他们在日常生活和工作中被新事物所感动，感动得非把它们写出来不可，于是便把它们写出来了。“新观察”编辑部去年一年共收到这类稿件近七千篇，发表了六十多篇。发表时仅在文字上作了细心的修改，基本上保持了原作的真面目。
    这些来自群众、反映群众的新生活和思想感情的“生活小故事”，无论就政治方面说或就文艺创作方面说，都有很大的意义和价值，应该获得各方面的充分重视。这些一两千字的小型作品取得了广大读者的热烈爱好，已经成为许多工农兵文化补习学校和文化学习班的优良教材。让更多的干部和群众来写“生活小故事”吧，让下厂下乡的作家们和一般文艺工作者也来写些“生活小故事”吧，让报纸杂志发表更多的“生活小故事”吧，因为广大读者需要这样的作品。
