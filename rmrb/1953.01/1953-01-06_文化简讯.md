    The First Graduating Class of the Central Academy of Drama Graduates
    The first class of 113 students from the Opera, Drama, and Stage Art departments of the Central Academy of Drama graduated at the end of last December. Among these students, 75% were originally the main professional backbone of provincial and military-level cultural troupes from various regions. They had all been engaged in dramatic work during the revolutionary struggle, made certain contributions, and had considerable experience, but lacked systematic theoretical and technical training. After the Central Academy of Drama was established, they were specially transferred to Beijing to study in the autumn of 1950. Over the past two and a half years, they have studied courses such as the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, literary and artistic thought, directing, performance, opera theory, composition, and stage design; and participated in movements such as literary and artistic rectification, the Three-Anti's, and Party consolidation. They have also gone to factories and rural areas to experience life and guide mass art activities. In the semester before graduation, under the guidance of teachers from various departments, they conducted internship performances: the Opera Department rehearsed the opera "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," the Drama Department rehearsed the play "Growing Up in Battle," and the Stage Art Department completed the stage design, scenery, and lighting for these two plays. The play "Growing Up in Battle" premiered in Beijing during the New Year.
    Lhasa People's Hospital Provides Free Smallpox Vaccinations for Tibetan People
    The Lhasa People's Hospital in Tibet has begun providing free smallpox vaccinations for the Tibetan people. In the past, very few people in Tibet used modern methods of vaccination, so smallpox was prevalent, seriously threatening the lives and health of the Tibetan people. According to statistics from 1925, more than 7,000 people died from smallpox in the Lhasa urban area and its suburbs alone. After the People's Hospital started providing free vaccinations for the citizens, citizens came in groups to get vaccinated. More than 1,200 people have been vaccinated so far. They all said gratefully: Chairman Mao thought so carefully, fearing that everyone would suffer from smallpox and hinder health and production, so he sent doctors to vaccinate us. In order to vaccinate the Tibetan people more widely, the Lhasa People's Hospital has prepared a large number of vaccines and sent out two vaccination teams to carry out vaccination work in the Lhasa urban area first.
    The Second Term Begins at the Central Institute for Nationalities, Central-South Branch
    The second term of the Central Institute for Nationalities, Central-South Branch (i.e., the Central-South Institute for Nationalities) began on December 24th last year. A total of 345 new students were selected from various regions for this term, including 19 ethnic groups, of which 8 ethnic groups are sending their children to study for the first time. The Central Institute for Nationalities, Central-South Branch is located in Hongshan, a scenic area in the eastern suburbs of Wuhan; the school buildings are all newly built buildings with very good facilities. More than 150 students graduated from the school's first term last year. Nong Juying (Zhuang), a member of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government, and Jin Baosheng (Yao), the county head of the Yao Autonomous Region of Dayao Mountain in Guangxi, are graduates of the school's first term. The Central-South Military and Political Committee attaches great importance to this college. Last year, it allocated more than 10 billion yuan to build school buildings for the college. Currently, the new school buildings have been completed. A palace-style auditorium that can accommodate 1,000 people will continue to be built this spring, and preparations are underway.

    中央戏剧学院本科第一届学生毕业
    中央戏剧学院本科歌剧系、话剧系、舞台美术系第一届学生一百一十三人已在去年十二月底毕业。这批学生中间，有百分之七十五原来是各地省级和军级文工团的主要业务骨干。他们都曾在革命斗争中从事戏剧工作，有一定的贡献，也有相当的经验，但是比较缺乏系统的理论和技术修养。中央戏剧学院成立后，特在一九五零年秋季把他们调来北京学习。两年半来，他们曾分别学习了马克思列宁主义基础、文艺思想、导演、表演、歌剧理论、作曲、舞台设计等课程；并参加了文艺整风、三反、整党等运动；他们还曾分别到工厂、农村体验生活，辅导群众艺术活动。毕业的前一学期，在各系教师的指导下，他们进行了实习演出：歌剧系排演了歌剧“小二黑结婚”，话剧系排演了话剧“战斗里成长”，舞台美术系完成了这两个戏的舞台设计和布景、灯光等工作。话剧“战斗里成长”并已于新年期间在北京公演。
    拉萨市人民医院免费为藏族人民种痘
    西藏拉萨市人民医院免费为藏族人民接种牛痘的工作已经开始。过去西藏地区很少有人用新式方法种痘，因此天花普遍流行，严重地威胁着西藏人民的生命和健康。根据一九二五年的统计，仅拉萨市区及近郊因患天花死亡的就有七千多人。当人民医院免费为市民种痘开始以后，市民们都成群结队地前来种痘，现已接种了一千二百多人，他们都感激地说：毛主席想的真周到，怕大家害天花妨碍健康和生产，就派医生来给我们种牛痘。为更广泛地给藏族人民种痘，拉萨市人民医院已准备了大批痘苗，并派出两个种痘小组，首先在拉萨市区进行接种工作。
    中央民族学院中南分院第二期开学
    中央民族学院中南分院（即中南民族学院）第二期已在去年十二月二十四日开学。这一期各地选派的新学员共三百四十五人，包括十九个民族，其中有八个民族是第一次派送自己的子弟来学习的。中央民族学院中南分院校址在武汉市东郊风景区洪山；校舍都是新建的楼房，设备很好。去年该校第一期已有一百五十多个学员毕业。现桂西僮族自治区人民政府委员农聚英（僮族），广西大瑶山瑶族自治区人民政府县长金宝生（瑶族）等，都是该校第一期毕业生。中南军政委员会对于这个学院极为重视，去年曾拨款一百多亿元，给该学院修建校舍，目前新校舍已经落成。今年春天将继续修建的一座可容一千人的宫殿式的大礼堂，现正在积极筹划中。
