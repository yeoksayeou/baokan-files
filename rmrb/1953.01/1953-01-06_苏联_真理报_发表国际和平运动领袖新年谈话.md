Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: At the end of 1952, the Soviet "Pravda" invited prominent leaders of the international peace movement to discuss the achievements of the struggle for peace in 1952, their views on the prospects for this struggle in 1953, and their own plans for the new year. "Pravda" today continues to publish these leaders' responses.

    Saifuddin Kitchlew, Stalin International Peace Prize laureate and Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, wrote: The World Peace Congress has provided all countries with new possibilities for strengthening the forces of peace. The fact that men and women with extremely different political beliefs can gather together to discuss how to defend peace is in itself an achievement of unparalleled importance. Kitchlew said: The fact that people not only talk about defending peace, but also make unanimous resolutions on fundamental issues, is an achievement that completely exceeded people's expectations, which shows that today it is possible—really possible—to avoid war.

    In the solemn halls of the Congress, representatives from all countries of the world loudly said: The people have awakened, and the warmongers have no way to deceive them. Kitchlew wrote: Therefore, peace can be preserved, because as long as the people want peace, no force can destroy it.

    Saifuddin Kitchlew said: What will the new year bring to the people? He said that he sincerely hopes that the bloodshed in Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam can be ended in 1953, and that a free and unified Korea, an autonomous Malaya, and an independent Vietnam can be established. He hopes that in 1953, genuine peace can be achieved, armaments can be reduced, atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, napalm bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction can be banned, international economic and cultural relations can be developed, racial discrimination can be stopped, and all colonial peoples can gain independence.

    Kitchlew wrote: After returning to their countries, the representatives will launch a movement to widely publicize the resolutions of the Congress.

    Saifuddin Kitchlew wrote: He is determined to dedicate the rest of his life to the cause of peace and continue to strive to defend peace and achieve genuine and lasting world peace.

    American writer Howard Fast pointed out that in the 1952 U.S. presidential election, American progressive forces launched a broad peace movement. He spoke of the difficulties commonly encountered by peace organizations throughout the United States. He said: But the future is bright. The American people have never demanded peace as fervently as they do now. Howard Fast said: People in every corner of the United States are demanding an end to the insane Korean gamble: there is no doubt that anti-war sentiment will develop into a magnificent peace movement.

    Fast hopes that in the new year, the forces of peace can defeat the forces of war, and that the heinous Korean War can end. Fast wrote: He hopes to see the American people's struggle against reactionary forces and fascism win a victory, and to see their struggle for democratic rights and civil liberties win a genuine victory.

    Choi Sam-ryul, Vice President of the Academy of Sciences of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, wrote: In 1952, the Korean people continued their struggle to defend the honor and freedom of their motherland, and they once again proved that they can not only fight good battles, but also think about the future development of the peaceful era in the difficult years of war. Choi Sam-ryul wrote: The establishment of the Academy of Sciences is a major event in our country's past year. In this way, the Korean people have once again shown the world their indestructible vitality and their confidence in winning the final victory over foreign aggressors. I am a scientist, and I want to dedicate my whole life to scientific research and the work of educating young cadres in our country. I will do everything in my power to advance the work of our country's recently established science center—the Academy of Sciences.

    Monica Felton, Stalin International Peace Prize laureate, wrote: In 1952, the number, strength, and enthusiasm of the warriors dedicated to the struggle for peace increased. The peace movement in Britain has developed greatly, as can be seen from the number of British delegates attending the Vienna World People's Peace Congress; this delegation was the second largest delegation attending the Congress, including fifty Labour Party members, ninety-three trade union workers, and ten pastors, who unanimously expressed their vow to fight for peace.

    Monica Felton said in her talk: She hopes that in 1953, international relations will begin to truly change, and that the foundations of world peace can be laid.

    Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Chairman of the Polish National Peace Committee and writer, wrote: I have the following hope for 1953: I hope to immediately end war and bloodshed, to give the oppressed and exploited people the right to self-determination and to achieve progress and prosperity, and that the peace movement, with the participation of the broadest masses of people in the world, can achieve victory. I believe that the cause of peace can and should become the basic principle of literary work. My plans as a writer and peace fighter are closely linked together. They are part of an inseparable whole.

    苏联“真理报”发表国际和平运动领袖新年谈话
    【新华社讯】在一九五二年年终时，苏联“真理报”曾请国际和平运动的卓越领袖们谈谈一九五二年的争取和平的斗争的成绩、对一九五三年这个斗争的前景的看法，以及他们自己在新的一年中有什么计划。“真理报”今天继续刊载了这些领袖们的答复。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁写道：世界人民和平大会已向一切国家提供了加强和平力量的新的可能性。具有极不相同的政治信念的男女能够聚集一堂，谈论如何保卫和平，这件事本身就是一个无比重要的成就。克其鲁说：人们不但谈论保卫和平，而且在基本问题上作出了一致的决议，这是一种完全出乎人们意想的成就，这说明今天有可能——真正有可能避免战争。
    在大会的庄严的大厅里，全世界各国的代表们高声说：人民已经觉醒了，战争贩子没有办法欺骗他们了。克其鲁写道：因此和平是可以保全的，因为只要人民希望和平，任何力量都不能破坏它。
    赛福丁·克其鲁说：新的一年会给人们带来什么呢？他说他衷心希望，在一九五三年能够结束朝鲜、马来亚和越南的流血，建立自由统一的朝鲜、自主的马来亚和独立的越南。他希望在一九五三年能够实现真正的和平，裁减军备，禁止原子弹、氢弹、凝固汽油弹、以及其他大规模屠杀人类的武器，发展国际经济与文化关系，制止种族歧视，一切殖民地人民都能获得独立。
    克其鲁写道：代表们在回国以后，将发动一个运动，来广泛宣传大会的决议。
    赛福丁·克其鲁写道：他决心把他的余生贡献给和平事业，继续为保卫和平与实现真正的持久的世界和平而奋斗。
    美国作家霍华德·法斯特指出：在一九五二年的美国总统的竞选中，美国进步力量开展了一个广泛的和平运动。他说到美国全国各地和平组织普遍遇到的困难。他说：可是前途是光明的。美国人民从来没有像现在这样热烈要求和平。霍华德·法斯特说：美国的每一个角落里的人都要求结束疯狂的朝鲜赌博：毫无疑问，反战的情绪一定会发展成为一个波澜壮阔的和平运动。
    法斯特希望在新的一年中，和平力量能够战胜战争力量，万恶的朝鲜战争能够结束。法斯特写道：他希望看到美国人民反对反动势力和法西斯化的斗争获得胜利，看到他们争取民主权利和公民自由的斗争获得真正的胜利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国科学院副院长崔三悦写道：在一九五二年中，朝鲜人民继续进行了维护祖国的荣誉和自由的斗争，他们又一次证明，他们不但能够打漂亮仗，而且在艰苦的战争岁月里还想到将来的和平时期的发展。崔三悦写道：科学院的成立是我国过去一年中的一件大事。这样，朝鲜人民又一次使全世界看到他们的不可摧毁的活力和他们对战胜外国侵略者取得最后胜利的信心。我是一个科学家，我要把我的整个生命献给科学研究工作和教育我国青年干部的工作。我一定尽我的一切力量推进我国最近成立的科学中心——科学院——的工作。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人蒙尼卡·费尔顿写道：在一九五二年中，献身于争取和平的斗争的战士的人数、力量和热忱都增加了。英国的和平运动有了很大的发展，这可以从出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的英国代表团的人数看出来；这个代表团是出席大会的第二大代表团，其中有五十位工党党员，九十三位工会工作者和十位牧师，他们一致表示誓为争取和平而奋斗。
    蒙尼卡·费尔顿在她的谈话中说：她希望在一九五三年中，国际关系开始真正有所改变，世界和平的基础能够奠定。
    波兰全国和平委员会主席、作家雅罗斯拉夫·伊瓦希凯维奇写道：我对一九五三年抱这样的希望：我希望立即结束战争和流血，给被压迫和被剥削的人民以自决和获得进步和繁荣的权利，有全世界极广泛的人民群众参加的和平运动能够取得胜利。我相信和平事业能够而且应当成为文艺工作的基本原则。我作为作家与和平战士而订立的计划是紧紧结合在一起的。它们是一个不可分割的整体的一部分。
