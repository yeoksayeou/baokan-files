    Truly Recognizing the Greatness and Loveliness of the Motherland
    Our Xinjiang Province Pastoral Area Delegation includes personnel from thirteen ethnic groups within Xinjiang Province, primarily representatives from pastoral areas. We departed from Dihua on September 17, 1952, and have been visiting the interior for nearly three months. We traveled from the westernmost part of our motherland to the easternmost part, from the Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains to the Bohai Bay. We have visited cities such as Lanzhou, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, and Hailar, as well as our people's capital – Beijing. We visited factories, mines, schools, hospitals, museums in various large cities, as well as the Tanggu New Port, the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang, and the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall in Harbin. We saw the magnificent mountains and rivers, vast plains, fertile land, majestic factories, resource-rich mines, and beautiful cities of our motherland. We witnessed the working class creating new production records with high enthusiasm and abundant wisdom like miracles. We saw the great spirit and noble qualities of the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland who bravely fought for the people's revolutionary cause; we saw the people of the motherland living happily and contentedly under the glorious illumination of Chairman Mao, while also working and studying diligently in various positions for the construction of the great motherland. We all grew up in various pastoral areas in western Xinjiang. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was impossible to come to the interior, and we knew very little about the situation in the motherland. Some people even did not know that the motherland had land and population many times greater than Xinjiang. After liberation, although we saw and heard some information about various aspects of the motherland from newspapers and talks by cadres, our understanding was still not very deep. After this visit, we truly saw the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and deeply felt the glory of being a people of the People's Republic of China. We feel that the new China is like a fire, containing enormous power, and the new China is like the rising sun in the morning, emitting brilliant rays.
    Wherever our delegation went, whether it was the Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Korean, or other ethnic groups, whether it was men, women, young, old, or children, whether it was workers, farmers, staff, students, soldiers, or university professors, all warmly welcomed us and took care of us meticulously according to the different living habits of our various ethnic groups. Herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia pastoral areas traveled dozens of miles to greet us. When we left, they rode their horses behind the cars, reluctant to part, even shedding tears to see us off. These unforgettable scenes made us deeply realize that the People's Republic of China is truly a large family of fraternal cooperation among all ethnic groups. Each of us has a common feeling: for three months, we have not been living in the remote interior thousands of miles away from Xinjiang, but living in our own home.
    The Development of Inner Mongolia's Pastoral Areas is a Model for Xinjiang's Pastoral Areas
    This time, we mainly visited the Huna League pastoral area in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Here, we learned a lot of advanced working experience in developing animal husbandry production, which will promote the rapid development of animal husbandry in Xinjiang.
    In the past, due to the endless exploitation and plunder by the Northern Warlords, the Puppet Manchukuo, Japanese imperialism, and the reactionary elements within the Inner Mongolian nationality, the population of the Inner Mongolian nationality decreased year by year, animal husbandry declined year by year, and there was no unity between the various nationalities. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Xilin Gol League originally had a population of 84,000, but by 1936, only 36,000 remained, a decrease of 48,000 in forty to fifty years. The original Hulunbuir League had 1.2 million sheep and 400,000 cattle in 1919, but by the time of liberation in 1945, only 400,000 sheep and less than 100,000 cattle remained. From these statistics, it is not difficult for us to imagine the miserable scene of the Inner Mongolian people's poverty, backwardness, disease, and death at that time.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, Inner Mongolia implemented national regional autonomy. Under the general principle and goal of "prosperity for both people and livestock," the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, based on the actual conditions of the pastoral areas, carefully formulated and implemented the policies of "no division, no struggle, no class demarcation," "free grazing," "increasing and protecting livestock," "both labor and capital benefit," and "light taxation" through national forms. This dispelled the concerns of the pastoral owners, stabilized the mood for production, criticized and corrected the erroneous viewpoints of "backward pastoral economy" and emphasis on agriculture over animal husbandry among cadres, as well as the idea that herdsmen do not improve their lives through labor production but sit and wait to share the fruits of struggle; abolished the feudal privilege system of occupying pastures, broke the boundaries between banners, and rationally adjusted and used pastures; implemented the policy of "actively protecting and rewarding the development of livestock," increased the wages of herdsmen based on the development of livestock and the benefit of both labor and capital, encouraged the enthusiasm of herdsmen for grazing; and carried out work such as wolf eradication, well drilling, grass cutting, shed building, pen building, prevention and treatment of livestock diseases, conservation of young livestock, selection and retention of superior breeds, organizing herdsmen to help each other in disaster prevention and production, and issuing pastoral loans to support production. This series of effective measures changed the phenomenon of discrimination and separation between various ethnic groups in the past, established a new national relationship of unity, fraternity, mutual assistance, and cooperation; animal husbandry has also been greatly developed, and people's lives have fundamentally changed. According to a survey by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the livestock in the four leagues of the eastern region increased by 110.35% from 1948 to 1952. The Hulunbuir League pastoral area, which developed the fastest, increased its livestock by 193.4% from 1947 to 1952; the Xilin Gol League, a purely pastoral area, increased its livestock by 129% from 1948 to 1952. The total number of livestock in Inner Mongolia has doubled since liberation.
    With the increase in livestock, the purchasing power of herdsmen has generally increased. According to statistics, the average purchasing power of each herdsman in the pastoral area was 433,000 yuan in 1951, and increased to 506,000 yuan in 1952. We personally saw in the grasslands of the Hulunbuir League that the lives of the herdsmen, both in terms of material and culture, have been significantly improved and enhanced. People who used to have no place to live, no food to eat, and no clothes to wear, were starving and freezing, and were on the verge of death, now live in brand-new yurts, with thick felt carpets inside, soft cotton quilts and blankets on the beds, and wearing various kinds of fine cloth or silk robes. They not only have enough meat, rice, and white flour, but also often prepare noodles, vermicelli, bread, and various kinds of candies and pastries, ready to entertain their relatives and friends at any time; they also have daily necessities such as stoves, enamel basins, and glass cups and plates, which they could not even see on the grasslands in the past. In the past, poor herdsmen could not even think about going to school; today, night schools and literacy classes have been established everywhere on the grasslands. Many herdsmen can now read newspapers and write letters, and almost every family subscribes to a copy of the Inner Mongolia Daily. Each Sumu (district) has also established schools, and most school-age children have the opportunity to study.
    Since 1950, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has carried out health work in the pastoral areas. Since the vigorous "Eradication of Syphilis" campaign, venereal diseases, which have always seriously harmed the population development of the Inner Mongolian nationality, have now reached the stage of eradication. At present, the population of the Inner Mongolian nationality has not only completely stopped declining, but some places have also begun to rise. Chenbaerhu Banner, Xinbaerhu Left Banner, and Solun Banner in Hulunbuir League have increased by 261 people in the two years of 1951 and 1952. Herdsmen have relieved their personal pain and therefore love Chairman Mao and thank the Communist Party even more. When we visited the Hulunbuir League pastoral area, many women who could not have children before now have children. They held their children and said to us: "This was given by Chairman Mao." The "Eradication of Syphilis" work has not only increased the population but also improved productivity. Many people who could not work due to illness in the past have recovered their health and participated in labor after the "Eradication of Syphilis." For example, La Mu, an old villager in Chenbaerhu Banner, originally had no livestock, but now he has accumulated 27 sheep, 8 cattle, 1 horse, and 3 carts from the wages he earned from grazing. There are many such examples in Inner Mongolia.
    Herdsmen also have hygienic habits in their daily lives. For example, in the past, they did not wash their bowls after eating and did not use chopsticks. Now every family washes their bowls and everyone uses spoons and chopsticks to eat; in the past, dishes and milk were covered with dust, but now they have covers, and some families even boil and disinfect the dishes every few days. Washing and drying clothes and bedding has now become a regular thing. Before the "Eradication of Syphilis," a peddler in Xinbaerhu Left Banner could not sell a box of soap in three months, but now he sells two or three boxes a month. We visited Haton Hu Shuo Baga (village) in Bayan Kada Sumu, Chenbaerhu Banner, which is a model health Baga in the whole Sumu. The herdsmen here have formulated a patriotic health convention that includes all aspects of their lives, such as food, accommodation, clothing, utensils, and maternal and infant health. Health committee members and activists in health work regularly conduct inspections, evaluations, criticisms, and commendations based on this convention.
    In short, the people in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have ended the tragic period of poverty and suffering in history and have embarked on a road of prosperity, happiness, and joy.
    Thoroughly Understanding the People's Government's Policies on Pastoral Areas
    During this visit, we gained a lot of knowledge. The main points are as follows:
    1. China is a multi-ethnic country, with the Han population being the largest and the development of economy and culture being the fastest. The history of the Chinese revolution proves that the development of all ethnic minorities in China must have the help of the Han nationality. This is a basic principle. In the past, due to the tyrannical oppression of ethnic minorities by the ruling class of the Han nationality, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries, hatred and separation between ethnic groups were created, which caused ethnic minorities to develop a psychology of distrusting the Han nationality. Some comrades in our delegation also had this ideological tendency. But through this visit, these comrades truly realized from the fact that Han cadres helped the Inner Mongolian nationality carry out the "Eradication of Syphilis" campaign and achieved great results, as well as the various machines manufactured by major factories in Northeast China, that the Han nationality is an excellent and powerful nation, and sincerely helps all fraternal nationalities develop their economy and culture. Therefore, their thinking quickly changed: not only did they fully realize that the help of the Han nationality to all fraternal nationalities is necessary, but they also hoped that the Han nationality would continue to vigorously help ethnic minorities. For example, after visiting the great project of the Tianlan Railway, Uyghur representative Wu Ma'erbake exclaimed: "Without the help of the Han nationality, it would probably be impossible for us to build a railway from Lanzhou to Dihua. I think it would take us several years just to dig a tunnel." At the same time, from the fact that the Inner Mongolian nationality helped the Oroqen nationality establish an autonomous region, we also realized that ethnic minorities with a large population should also enthusiastically help ethnic groups with fewer people to jointly develop their economy and culture, just like the Han nationality.
    2. After visiting Inner Mongolia, we have a clearer understanding of the People's Government's policies on pastoral areas. The pastoral owner economy in nomadic areas is an economy of a semi-feudal and semi-capitalist nature. For this kind of economy, in addition to taking appropriate steps and methods to abolish its feudal part, the economic part of its capitalist nature is protected in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program and developed under the leadership of the state-owned economy.
    Some pastoral owners in Xinjiang Province have ideological concerns about fearing struggle and division, and are not at ease with production. For example, Comrade A Ha Yi, a Kazakh representative in our delegation, originally had more than 1,000 sheep in his family, and was a relatively wealthy pastoral household. There were concerns in his thinking. Therefore, when someone asked him about the number of his livestock, he refused to tell the truth. After visiting Inner Mongolia and seeing that the pastoral owner economy has been protected for several years and the policy of no struggle and no division has been implemented, he dropped his ideological burden, automatically talked about the changes in his thinking and his feelings after the visit, and also specifically put forward a plan to develop livestock after returning. Another example is Na Yi Tai, a Mongolian representative, who owns a considerable amount of livestock. After the start of the land reform in the agricultural area, he always thought that he was the target of struggle, so he was very worried and depressed. Before leaving Dihua, other representatives arranged for family production, but he didn't even write a letter to his family. After listening to the report of the head of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Gui Sui and seeing the development of the pastoral owner economy in the grasslands of the Hulunbuir League with his own eyes, he completely dispelled his concerns and wrote a letter to tell his family about the protection of the pastoral owner economy in Inner Mongolia, and instructed his family to take good care of the livestock; if the livestock suffered losses due to inadequate care, it would be a disservice to Chairman Mao and the People's Government. He also said that he would develop from the existing 3,000 sheep to 10,000 sheep in the next few years.
    3. Another gain from visiting Inner Mongolia is that we truly recognized the policy of freedom of religious belief. There was a lama representative in our delegation who did not fully understand the policy of freedom of religious belief in the past. Although he knew that religious belief in Xinjiang was free, he did not believe that other places were the same as Xinjiang. He mistakenly believed that the lamas in the interior were probably not as free as in Xinjiang. When he came out to visit, he was afraid that others would laugh at him, so he took off his original lama clothes and put on another set of clothes. But in Xi'an and Inner Mongolia, he personally saw that the lamas were completely free and still wore lama clothes. He said: "I now truly understand that Chairman Mao's policy of freedom of religious belief is the same everywhere in the country. Moreover, religious belief is not only free today, but will be free at any time in the future."
    4. Before liberation, due to the destruction of animal husbandry by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people in the pastoral areas deeply felt that livestock products were not worth much and believed that the development of animal husbandry had little prospect. After liberation, due to the publicity and education of the People's Government in the pastoral areas, as well as the rational adjustment of the price difference between livestock products and industrial and agricultural products, and the vigorous purchase of livestock products, the production enthusiasm of the people in the pastoral areas has been greatly improved. This time, we visited the wool textile factories in Tianjin and Taiyuan, and learned about the role and value of wool in the industrial construction of the motherland, which further encouraged the enthusiasm for developing animal husbandry. Many representatives said: Wool is an indispensable and important raw material in our country's industry. In order to build our great motherland and improve and improve our lives, we must do our best to develop animal husbandry when we go back. We should not only increase the number of sheep, but also improve the breed of sheep to make the wool better. This visit also used facts to criticize the idea of "backward pastoral economy" and emphasis on agriculture over animal husbandry of individual comrades in the delegation, and made them change their thinking. For example, Aba Kuni Xikufu, the Mongolian county head among the representatives, used to think that it was useless to engage in animal husbandry, turning around all day with livestock that could not speak, and could not make any name for himself in the end. But after this visit and study in Inner Mongolia, he said: "Animal husbandry is an indispensable economy in our country's economy, and it should not only be developed, but should be greatly developed."
    In short, our gains from this visit are very great. The above are just a few large and main aspects, but the actual gains are not limited to this. All these gains are given to us by Chairman Mao's leadership and Chairman Mao's great ethnic policies. In order not to fail Chairman Mao's concern and love for our ethnic minorities, we must make the greatest efforts to build the great motherland.

    我们的收获
    新疆省牧区代表参观团团长  巴提汉  副团长  格尔夏  苏史清
    真正认识了祖国的伟大和可爱
    我们新疆省牧区代表参观团，包括新疆省境内十三个民族的人员，主要是牧区的代表。我们从一九五二年九月十七日由迪化出发来到内地，参观了近三个月。我们从祖国的最西边，走到了祖国的最东边，从天山，从阿尔泰山，从昆仑山走到了渤海湾。我们到过了兰州、西安、太原、归绥、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、海拉尔等城市及我们人民的首都——北京，参观了各个大城市的工厂、矿山、学校、医院、博物馆以及塘沽新港、沈阳郊区高坎村农业生产合作社和哈尔滨的东北烈士馆。我们看到了祖国壮丽的山河，广大的平原，肥沃的土地，雄伟的工厂，蕴藏丰富的矿山和美丽的城市。我们看到了工人阶级以高度的积极性和丰富的智慧，奇迹一样地创造着生产新纪录。我们看到祖国人民优秀的儿女为人民革命事业英勇奋斗的伟大精神和崇高的品质；我们看到祖国人民在毛主席的光辉照耀下，快乐幸福地生活着，同时也在为伟大祖国的建设，在各个不同的岗位上紧张地工作着、学习着。我们都是生长在祖国西部新疆各个牧区的，过去在国民党反动派的统治下，不可能来到内地，对祖国情况知道得很少。有些人甚至不知道祖国除新疆以外，还有大过新疆多少倍的国土和多过新疆多少倍的人口。解放以后，虽然从报纸上，从干部的谈话中看到和听到一些关于祖国各方面的情况，但我们的认识仍然是不很深刻的。经过这次参观，我们真正看到了祖国的伟大和可爱，深深地感觉到作一个中华人民共和国人民的光荣。我们觉得新中国像一团火，蕴蓄着巨大无比的力量，新中国像早晨初升的太阳，发射着万丈光芒。
    在我们参观团到过的地方，无论是汉族、回族、蒙族、藏族、朝鲜族或其他民族，无论是男的、女的、青年、老人和小孩，无论是工人、农民、职员、学生、军人或大学教授，都十分热情地欢迎我们，并按照我们各个民族的不同的生活习惯，无微不至地照顾和招待我们。内蒙牧区的牧民们，跑到几十里路以外来迎接我们。当我们离开时，又骑着马跟在汽车后面恋恋不舍地、甚至流着眼泪来送行。这些难忘的情景，使我们深刻地体会到中华人民共和国真正是各族人民友爱合作的大家庭。我们每一个人都有一个共同的感觉：三个月来，我们不是生活在离开新疆千万里路以外的遥远的内地，而是生活在自己的家里。
    内蒙牧区的发展是新疆牧区的榜样
    我们这次出来，主要参观了内蒙古自治区的呼纳盟牧区。在这里，我们曾里，学习了很多发展畜牧业生产的先进工作经验，这些经验将推动我们新疆的畜牧业迅速地向前发展。
    过去，由于北洋军阀、伪满、日本帝国主义以及国民党反动派和内蒙古民族内部反动分子的无穷尽的压榨和掠夺，内蒙古民族的人口曾逐年减少，畜牧业逐年衰退，各民族之间互不团结。锡林郭勒盟在清末时，原有人口八万四千人，至一九三六年仅剩三万六千人，四五十年当中就减少了四万八千人。原呼伦贝尔盟一九一九年有羊一百二十万只、牛四十万头，到一九四五年解放时，只剩了四十万只羊和不到十万头的牛。从这些统计数字中，我们就不难想像当时内蒙人民生活贫困、落后、疾病和死亡的凄惨情景。
    解放后，在伟大人民领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，内蒙古实行了民族区域自治。内蒙古自治区人民政府在“人畜两旺”的总原则和总目标下，根据牧区实际情况，通过民族形式，慎重地制定和执行了“不分、不斗、不划阶级”、“自由放牧”、
    “增畜保畜”、“劳资两利”以及“轻税”的政策，打消了牧主的顾虑，安定了生产情绪，批判和纠正了干部中间“牧业经济落后”的重农轻牧的错误观点，以及牧民不从劳动生产来改善自己的生活，而坐待分吃斗争果实的思想；废除了霸占牧场的封建特权制度，打破了旗与旗间的界线，合理地调整和使用了牧场；贯彻了“积极保护与奖励发展牲畜”的方针，在发展牲畜和劳资两利的基础上提高了牧工工资，鼓励了牧工放牧的积极性；并进行了打狼、打井、打草、搭棚、搭圈、防治畜疫、保育幼畜，选留优种、组织牧民防灾生产互助，发放牧业贷款扶助生产等工作。这一系列的有效措施，改变了过去各民族间的歧视和隔阂的现象，建立了团结、友爱、互助、合作的新的民族关系；牧畜业也得到了很大的发展，人民的生活从根本上起了变化。据内蒙古自治区人民政府的调查，东部区四个盟从一九四八年至一九五二年牲畜增加了百分之一百一十点三五，发展最快的呼纳盟牧业区从一九四七年至一九五二年牲畜增加了百分之一百九十三点四；纯牧区的锡林郭勒盟，从一九四八年至一九五二年，牲畜增加了百分之一百二十九。全内蒙的牲畜总数较解放时已经增加了一倍。
    随着牲畜的增加，牧民的购买力普遍地提高了。据统计，牧业区每一个牧民的平均购买力在一九五一年是人民币四十三万三千元，一九五二年增加到五十万六千元。我们在呼纳盟草原上亲眼看到的牧民生活，无论在物质方面和文化方面，都有了显著的改善和提高。从前没有住、没有吃、没有穿，饥寒交迫，濒于死亡的人们，今天都住着簇新的蒙古包，包内铺着厚厚的毡子，床上放着软软的棉被和毯子，穿着各种各样的细布面或绸缎面的皮袍。他们不但已有了足够的肉食、大米和白面，而且还经常准备有挂面、粉条、面包和各种各样的糖果、点心，随时用来招待他们的亲戚和朋友；也有了从前在草地连看都看不到的火炉、搪瓷脸盆和玻璃杯盘等日用品。过去，穷苦的牧民们是根本谈不到读书的；今天，草原上到处成立了夜校和识字班。很多牧民已能读书看报和写信，差不多每个人家里都订有一份内蒙古日报。各苏木（区）并都已设立学校，大多数的学龄儿童得到了读书的机会。
    从一九五○年起，内蒙古自治区人民政府在牧区开展卫生工作，大力开展“驱梅”（驱除梅毒）运动以来，一向严重危害着内蒙古民族人口发展的性病，现在已达到根绝阶段。目前，内蒙古民族的人口，不仅已完全停止了下降，有的地方并已开始上升。呼纳盟的陈巴尔虎旗、新巴尔虎左翼旗、索伦旗三个旗在一九五一年和一九五二年两年中就已增加了二百六十一人。牧民解除了切身痛苦，因而更加热爱毛主席，感谢共产党。我们在呼纳盟牧区参观时，很多以前不能生育的妇女，现在都生了小孩。她们抱着小孩对我们说：“这是毛主席给的。”“驱梅”工作不仅使人口增加了，而且还提高了生产力。很多以前因病不能劳动的人，在“驱梅”以后都恢复了健康，参加了劳动。如陈巴尔虎旗的拉木老乡，原来是没有牲畜的，现在用放牧所得的工资已积蓄了二十七只羊、八头牛、一匹马、三辆车。这样的事例，在内蒙是很多的。
    牧民在日常生活中也有了讲求卫生的习惯。如过去吃饭不洗碗，不用筷子，现在每家都洗碗，每个人都使用羹匙筷子吃饭；过去食具和牛奶上飞满灰尘，现在都有了盖布，有的人家隔几日还把食具煮沸消毒一次。洗晒衣服被褥，现在都成为经常的事了。“驱梅”前，新巴尔虎左翼旗一个摊贩三个月卖不完一箱子肥皂，现在一个月就卖二三箱。我们参观了陈巴尔虎旗巴音喀达苏木的哈顿虎硕巴嘎
    （村），这是全苏木的卫生模范巴嘎。这里的牧民自己订立了包括整个生活的各个方面如食、宿、衣物、用具和妇女、婴儿保健等的爱国卫生公约，卫生委员和卫生工作的积极分子，经常不定期地根据这个公约进行检查评比和批评表扬。
    总之，内蒙牧区人民已结束了历史上贫穷苦难的悲惨时期，走上了繁荣、快乐、幸福的道路。
    彻底明白了人民政府对牧区的政策
    在这次参观中，我们得到了许多的知识。主要的有以下几点：
    一、中国是一个多民族的国家，汉族人口最多，经济文化的发展也最快。中国革命的历史证明：中国各个少数民族的发展，都必须要有汉民族的帮助。这是一条基本的原则。过去由于汉民族的统治阶级，特别是国民党反动派对少数民族专横压迫，造成了民族之间的仇视和隔阂，因而少数民族就产生不相信汉民族的心理。我们参观团的个别同志也曾有过这种思想倾向。但通过这次参观，这些同志从汉民族干部帮助内蒙古民族开展“驱梅”运动并取得了很大成绩，以及东北各大工厂所制造的各种机器等事实中，真正认识到了汉民族是一个优秀的、有力量的民族，而且是赤诚地帮助各兄弟民族发展经济文化的，因此思想上很快地起了变化：不但完全认识到汉民族对各兄弟民族的帮助是必要的，而且都希望汉民族继续大力帮助少数民族。如维吾尔族代表吾买尔巴克在参观了天兰铁路的伟大工程以后感叹地说：“如果没有汉民族的帮助，我们要想从兰州修一条铁路到迪化，恐怕是不可能的。光一个洞子，我看就得挖上几年。”同时，我们从内蒙古民族帮助鄂伦春民族建立自治区的事实中，也体会到人数多的少数民族，同样应该像汉民族一样热忱地帮助人数更少的民族共同发展经济和文化。
    二、参观了内蒙，我们更清楚地认识了人民政府的牧区政策。游牧区的牧主经济，是半封建半资本主义性质的经济。对于这种经济，除采取适当的步骤和方法废除其封建部分外，对于其资本主义性质部分的经济，是根据共同纲领的精神予以保护并使其在国营经济的领导下发展的。
    我们新疆省有些牧主有怕斗怕分的思想顾虑，不安心于生产。如我们参观团的一个哈萨克族代表阿哈以同志，家里本来有一千多只羊，是一个比较富裕的牧户，他的思想上就存在着顾虑。因此有人问他的牲畜数目时，他一直不肯实说。在参观了内蒙，看到几年来保护牧主经济，执行不斗不分的政策以后，他才丢掉了思想包袱，自动地谈出思想转变的情况和参观后的感想，并且还具体地提出了回去以后发展牲畜的计划。又如蒙族代表那以台，家里拥有相当数量的牲畜，农业区土地改革开始以后，他就一直认为自己是被斗争的对象，因而心事重重，非常苦闷。离开迪化前，其他代表都安置家庭生产，他却连封信都没给家里写。经过在归绥听了内蒙古自治区首长的报告和在呼纳盟草地亲眼看到了牧主经济发展的情况，他才完全打消了顾虑，写信告诉家里关于内蒙牧主经济被保护的情形，并嘱咐家人好好照顾牲畜；如因照顾不周，使牲畜遭受了损失，那就是对不起毛主席和人民政府。他并且说，要在最近几年内，从现有三千头羊的基础上发展到一万头。
    三、参观内蒙的另一个收获是真正认识了宗教信仰自由的政策。我们参观团有个喇嘛代表，过去对宗教信仰自由政策不很了解。他虽然知道新疆宗教信仰是自由的，但不相信其他地方也和新疆一样。他误认为内地的喇嘛大概已不像新疆那样自由了。在出来参观的时候，他怕别人笑他，于是把原穿的喇嘛服脱掉，另换上了一套衣服。但在西安和内蒙，他亲眼看到了喇嘛完全是自由的，仍然穿着喇嘛服。他说：“我现在才真正明白毛主席的宗教信仰自由政策，在全国各地无论哪里都是一样的。而且，宗教信仰不仅在今天是自由的，将来无论在什么时候也都是自由的。”
    四、解放前，由于国民党反动派对畜牧业的摧残，牧区人民深深感到畜产品不值钱，认为畜牧业发展前途不大。解放后由于人民政府在牧区的宣传教育，以及合理地调整畜产品与工农业产品的差价，并大力收购畜产品的结果，牧区人民的生产情绪已大为提高。我们这次参观了天津、太原的毛纺织厂，知道了羊毛在祖国工业建设上所起的作用与价值，更进一步鼓起了发展畜牧业的情绪。很多代表都说：羊毛在我们国家工业上是一种不可缺少的重要原料，为了建设我们伟大的祖国和改善、提高我们的生活，我们回去一定要用尽一切力量发展畜牧业。我们不但应该使羊增多起来，而且必须改良羊种，使羊毛更好起来。这次参观，同样也用事实批判了参观团内个别同志的“牧业经济落后”的重农轻牧的思想，并使之得到了转变。如代表中的蒙族县长阿巴库尼西库夫同志，以前认为搞畜牧是没有出息的，成天跟着不会讲话的牲畜转，终究搞不出什么名堂来。但这次在内蒙的参观学习结束后，他说：“畜牧业经济是我们国家经济中不可缺少的经济，不但应该发展，而且应该大大地发展。”
    总之，我们这一次参观的收获是很大的，以上只是几个大的和主要的方面，实际并不仅止于此。所有这些收获，都是毛主席的领导和毛主席的伟大的民族政策给我们的。为了不辜负毛主席对我们少数民族的关怀和爱护，我们要为建设伟大的祖国而作最大的努力。
