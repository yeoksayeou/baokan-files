    The American aggressors, in order to continue and attempt to expand the unpopular war of aggression against Korea, have tried their best to conceal their failures in Korea in the United States and its puppet countries, attempting to deceive people by relying on some fabricated "victory news." This shameless trick has obviously been a complete failure. Recently, a reactionary Canadian newspaper, the "Vancouver Sun"—one of Canada's largest newspapers, claiming to have over 500,000 readers—conducted a "test" on its readers. After the "test," the newspaper admitted that its readers were disgusted with the Korean news released by American and British news agencies, exposing that these messages were fabricated, deceptive, unreliable, and worthless. The newspaper hurriedly sent a telegram to the major American and British news agencies (Associated Press, United Press, Reuters, Canadian Press, etc.), asking them to find a way to remedy the situation. This incident shows that the American aggressors' unpopular war of aggression against Korea, even with the propaganda machine racking its brains to carry out deceptive propaganda, is still spurned by the people.
    The course of events is as follows:
    In order to "test" whether its readers were paying attention to the Korean war news, the "Vancouver Sun" published a Korean war dispatch from the Canadian Press on the front page of the newspaper for three consecutive days on November 18, 19, and 20, 1952, in a prominent position, in the same location, with the title and content unchanged, only changing the date the telegram was sent. Such a prominent repetition of the same news for three consecutive days did not elicit any response from the readers. Except for one person who wrote to the newspaper pointing out this repetition, all other readers ignored it.
    This surprised the "Vancouver Sun," which resentfully blamed readers for ignoring the Korean War. Later, it collected some opinions from readers. According to the reactionary newspaper itself, the reason why readers ignored its "test" was that they simply did not believe the deceptive propaganda of American and British news agencies. A man named Fergusson said: "Let me tell you, the reason why no one wrote or called you is that most sensible people have long known that all news about the Korean War, as reported by you and most other newspapers, is fabricated, deceptive, unreliable, and worthless." Another, Norman Antleum, told the "Vancouver Sun" that she had long noticed the repetition of the war news but did not think it was a "test" by the newspaper because the newspaper often republished messages with almost identical content many times in a year. She vividly described: "Every night, I read the usual Korean news, and every night, I routinely read: 'A small team of American soldiers and a few South Korean troops drove 15,000 loudly shouting Chinese (or Communists, or North Koreans) from Heartbreak Ridge (or Little Gibraltar, or Needle Point Hill). The Chinese (or Communists, etc.) suffered heavy casualties. A thousand Communist aircraft were shot down. The United Nations forces suffered no losses, etc.' It's like this every day. How can we know when you are joking?" Another, Charles Stevenson, ridiculed the exaggerated war news from American and British news agencies, saying that if the United Nations forces' estimates of the losses on the Chinese and Korean side were correct, then "Red China must immediately establish an immigration bureau to immigrate from overseas to fill the population of its territory."
    The "Vancouver Sun" also revealed that another reason why some readers were disgusted with the Korean reports from American and British news agencies was that they hated the war. The "Vancouver Sun" quoted an American reader as saying: People are "so depressed, disgusted, and disappointed" with the situation in the Korean War "that they don't want to read news about it." A mother in Vancouver said, "I shed many tears for the suffering of every child, and I understand the sadness of widows and orphaned mothers. Since the beginning of the Korean War, I feel that all wars are manipulated by certain political forces, and the ordinary people's desire for peace in the world is stifled. ..."
    Of course, even more Americans and Canadians dislike Korean news from American and British news agencies because they oppose this unpopular war, a point that the "Vancouver Sun" dares not say.

    美国欺骗宣传的破产
    美国侵略者为继续和企图扩大不得人心的侵朝战争，就极力在美国和它的仆从国家内隐瞒它们在朝鲜的失败，企图依靠一些捏造的“胜利消息”来骗取人心。这种无耻的伎俩，显然已经遭到彻底失败了。最近加拿大的一家反动报纸“温哥华太阳报”——这是加拿大最大的报纸之一，自称有读者五十万以上——向它的读者作了一次“测验”。这个报纸在“测验”后，承认它的读者厌恶美、英通讯社所发的那些朝鲜新闻，揭露这些消息是假造的，骗人的，不可靠的和毫无价值的。这个报纸赶紧打了一个电报给美、英的各主要通讯社（美联社、合众社、路透社、加拿大通讯社等），要它们想法挽救这种情况。这件事说明了美国侵略者在朝鲜进行的不得人心的侵略战争，虽然通过它的宣传机器挖空心思进行欺骗宣传，也还是遭到人民的唾弃。
    事情的经过是这样的。
    “温哥华太阳报”为了“测验”它的读者是否注意朝鲜战讯，在一九五二年十一月十八日、十九日和二十日报纸的第一版上，用显著地位把一条加拿大通讯社所发的朝鲜战讯连登三天，登在同一地位，标题和内容都一字不改，只换了一下电讯发出的日期。这样十分显著地把同一新闻连登三次，竟没有引起读者的反应。除了一个人写信给这个报纸指出这个重复之外，其余的所有读者都没有理会这回事。
    这使“温哥华太阳报”很吃惊，它懊丧地责备读者忽视朝鲜战争。以后，它在读者中收集了一些意见。据这个反动报纸自己承认，读者不理睬它搞的
    “测验”的原因，是因为他们根本不相信美、英通讯社的欺骗宣传。一个叫做费尔古孙的说：“告诉你们吧，没有人给你们写信和打电话的原因，是大多数有头脑的人很久以来就知道了一切关于朝鲜战争的新闻，像你们和大多数别的报纸所报道的，都是假造的、骗人的、不可靠的和毫无价值的。”另一个叫诺尔曼·安特玲姆的告诉“温哥华太阳报”说，她早就看出了这条战讯的重复，但没有想到这次是报纸搞的什么“测验”，因为一年以来，报纸上经常是把内容几乎完全相同的消息重登许多次。她生动地描写道：“每天晚上，我读着照例的朝鲜新闻，每天晚上，我照例地读着：‘一小队美国兵和少数南朝鲜军把一万五千名高声喊叫的中国人（或共军，或北朝鲜人）从伤心岭（或小直布陀多岭，或针尖山）赶跑了。中国人（或共军等等）死伤惨重。一千架共军飞机被击落了。联合国军无损失云云。’天天是这样，我们怎能知道什么时候你们是开的玩笑呢？”还有一个叫做沙尔士田孙的嘲笑美英通讯社那些夸大的战讯道：如果联合国军所估计的中朝方面的损失是正确的话，那么“红色中国必须马上成立一个移民局，从海外移民来填补它国土上的人口。”
    “温哥华太阳报”又透露，另一部分读者厌恶美、英通讯社的朝鲜报道的原因，是他们厌恶这个战争。“温哥华太阳报”引用一个美国读者的话说：人们对朝鲜战争的情况是“这样地沮丧、厌恶和失望，所以他们不想读关于它的新闻。”温哥华的一个母亲说：“我为每一个孩子的受难而淌下许多眼泪，我体会得到寡妇、孤母的伤心。从朝鲜战争开始以来，我感到一切战争操纵在某些政治势力的手里，而全世界普通人民心底的和平愿望被扼杀了。……”
    当然，还有更多的美国人、加拿大人之所以厌恶美、英通讯社的朝鲜电讯，是因为他们反对这个不得人心的战争，这一点是“温哥华太阳报”所不敢说出来的。
