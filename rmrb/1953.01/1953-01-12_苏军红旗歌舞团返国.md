Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble has departed from Manzhouli to return home.

Before leaving Chinese territory, the Soviet friends were filled with reluctance to part. At noon on the 10th, all members of the song and dance ensemble and the staff accompanying them in various places to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities held a farewell banquet on the train in Manzhouli. Everyone toasted, hugged, and kissed each other, and many were in tears. Two hours before returning home, the song and dance ensemble also warmly held a farewell performance for people from all walks of life in Manzhouli. Before the Soviet friends boarded the train, representatives from all walks of life in Manzhouli and all members of the song and dance ensemble held a farewell ceremony. Huang Hongrui, Deputy Director of the Manzhouli Military and Political Committee, delivered a farewell speech, saying, "Although we are separated, we will continue to advance victoriously for a common cause in different places and different positions, and we firmly believe that our friendship will develop and consolidate day by day!" Yu Ji, a representative of the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, also recited a farewell poem written on a large piece of red silk: "Dedicate our hearts to the great Stalin!" At this time, Director Alexandrov excitedly embraced the well-wishers for a long time. He said: "We don't say goodbye, we will meet again." As the train was about to start, the members frequently got off the train and shook hands and hugged the well-wishers. They repeatedly said in fluent Chinese: "Dear friends, goodbye!"

The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble came to our country with the deep friendship of the Soviet people at the beginning of last year's Sino-Soviet Friendship Month activities. In the past two months, they have performed sixty times, large and small, in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, and Harbin, directly meeting one million Chinese people. Fifteen million people listened to live broadcasts of their performances. The members of the song and dance ensemble also participated in symposiums and reports organized by literary and art circles in various places and provided specific assistance to the literary and art workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    苏军红旗歌舞团返国
    据新华社讯：苏军红旗歌舞团离满洲里返国。
    在离开中国国境之前，苏联友人们充满了惜别之情。十日中午，歌舞团全体人员和陪同他们在各地参加“中苏友好月”活动的工作人员们在满洲里的列车上举行了告别宴会。大家相互干杯、拥抱和接吻，许多人都热泪盈眶。歌舞团在返国前两小时，还热情地向满洲里市各界人民举行了一次告别演出。在苏联友人上车前，满洲里市各界人民代表和歌舞团全体人员举行了告别式。满洲里军政委员会副主任黄鸿瑞致欢送词说：“我们虽然分别了，但我们将继续在不同的地方、不同的岗位上，为一个共同的事业胜利前进，深信我们的友谊将一天比一天更加发展和巩固！”中苏友好协会总会代表虞棘还朗诵了写在大幅红绸上的欢送诗：“把我们的心献给伟大的斯大林！”这时，亚历山大罗夫团长激动地长久地和欢送的人们拥抱。他说：“我们不说分别、我们还要见面的。”在列车将要开动时，团员们还频频下车和欢送人们握手、拥抱，他们一再用熟练的中国话说：“亲爱的朋友，再见！”
    苏军红旗歌舞团在去年中苏友好月活动开始时带着苏联人民的深厚情谊来到我国。两个月来，在北京、天津、济南、南京、上海、杭州、广州、武汉、沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨等城市作了大小六十次的演出，直接和一百万中国人民见了面。收听他们演出实况广播的有一千五百万人。歌舞团团员们还参加了各地文艺界所组织的座谈会和报告会，并对中国人民解放军的文艺工作者进行了具体帮助。
