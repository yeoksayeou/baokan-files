Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The General Bureau of Electricity Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has established and strengthened the structure of the Electricity Design Bureau in order to strengthen the leadership of the electricity basic construction design work. Recently, it also held the first National Electricity Design Conference to exchange experiences in electricity design work and deploy the design tasks for electricity basic construction in 1953.
    The current basic situation of electricity design work is: the design cannot keep up with the requirements of construction and planning, the design institutions in various regions have not been strengthened and improved according to the needs of work development; the old and backward thinking of some engineering and technical personnel hinders the learning of advanced Soviet experience and reduces the quality and efficiency of design work. In view of this situation, the National Electricity Design Conference focused on the following tasks: (1) Taking sufficient time for typical reports and discussions, and holding an electricity design exhibition, to systematically exchange national electricity design experience, and focus on studying and solving the main problems in design work, such as correctly mastering and using data, adopting advanced Soviet technical standards, establishing the concept of economic accounting and safety and welfare, and doing a good job in design review, etc. (2) Emphasizing the criticism of incorrect design ideas, such as thinking that design work is "you get what you pay for, there is nothing wrong with spending a lot of money," "you can't have both good and fast," and "design inevitably has to be reworked," and other capitalist design ideas, as well as being complacent with the design experience of the past restoration and reconstruction period, so that the participants realized the harm of these erroneous design ideas, realized the importance of learning from the Soviet Union, and realized that design must be a product of the close combination of political correctness, economic rationality, and technical advancement. (3) Strengthening organizational leadership, first of all, establishing and improving institutions and systems, strengthening forces, and resolving to use professional training and a rapid method combined with on-site experience to train design talents. The conference also formulated the Draft Provisional Management Regulations for Electricity Basic Construction Design, the Draft Provisional Management Regulations for Electricity Basic Construction Project Design Review, and the Draft Procedures for Review and Approval of Electricity Basic Construction Projects, etc.

    燃料工业部电业管理总局
    开全国电业设计会议
    布置今年基本建设设计任务
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局为加强对电业基本建设设计工作的领导，已成立和充实了电业设计局的机构。最近又召开首次全国电业设计会议，交流了电业设计工作的经验，布置了一九五三年电业基本建设的设计任务。
    目前电业设计工作的基本情况是：设计赶不上施工和计划的要求，各地区设计机构尚未根据工作发展的需要加以充实和健全；某些工程技术人员的陈旧落后思想，阻碍着向苏联先进经验的学习，减低了设计工作的质量和效率。根据这种情况，全国电业设计会议着重进行了下列的工作：（一）以充分的时间进行了典型报告和讨论，举行了电业设计展览会，做到系统地交流全国电业设计经验，集中地研究解决设计工作中的主要问题，如正确掌握和使用资料、采用苏联的先进技术标准、建立经济核算观点和安全福利观点、做好设计审核工作等。（二）着重批判了不正确的设计思想，如认为设计工作“一分钱一分货，十分钱没有错”，“要好快不了，要快好不了”，“设计就不能不返工”等资本主义设计思想，和自满于过去恢复改建时期设计经验的思想，使到会人员认识到这些错误设计思想的危害性，认识到学习苏联的重要，认识到设计必须是政治上正确、经济上合理、技术上先进三者密切结合的产物。（三）加强组织领导，首先是建立和健全机构、制度，增强力量，下决心用专业训练和与现场经验相结合的快速办法，培养设计人才。会议并制定了电业基本建设设计暂行管理条例草案、电业基本建设工程设计审核暂行管理条例草案及电业基本建设工程审核批准程序草案等。
