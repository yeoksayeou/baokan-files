The Li Seung-man Gang's Military Expenditure for This Year Accounts for 83.3% of the Total Budget

    The Li Seung-man gang government submitted the budget for the 1953 fiscal year to the pseudo-"National Assembly" on the 15th, with a total budget of 726 billion South Korean won. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 19th, quoting a pseudo-government official, the total amount allocated to the pseudo-army this year will reach 600 billion won, accounting for more than 83.2% of the total budget.

    How will the Li Seung-man gang cope with its huge expenditure? Pseudo-Acting Prime Minister Baek Du-jin said that 215.5 billion won would be "the South Korean government's own revenue," meaning to continue squeezing the already impoverished people of South Korea. In addition, Baek Du-jin admitted that more than 60% of the total budget would rely on aid from the United States and the "United Nations."

The United States Entices Israeli Youth to Serve as Cannon Fodder in the Korean War

    Israel's "People's Voice" newspaper, in an article titled "Israel to Supply Cannon Fodder for the Korean War," stated: "American figures" in Jerusalem are distributing leaflets calling on Israeli youth to participate in the aggressive war in Korea. The American leaflets state: "Young people, demobilized soldiers, and unemployed people, you have only one way to escape hardship, and that is to volunteer to participate in the war against the Korean Communists to avoid starvation."

The People in Southern Korea Live in Extreme Misery

    An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 18th, quoted "elderly Koreans" as saying that the South Korean people are in "the worst plight since the Japanese began their occupation in 1905." The news stated: "Evidence of this increasingly severe hardship in South Korea is that three or four corpses can be seen lying dead on the streets of Seoul every week. The main causes of death are inadequate housing or clothing in freezing temperatures, malnutrition, and typhus, smallpox, and intermittent fever."

The United States Plans to Use Franco's Troops to Invade Korea

    According to a report by the Madrid correspondent of the American "Christian Science Monitor," Moeller: When U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins visited Madrid in December 1952, he raised the issue of sending Spanish troops to Korea. Moeller pointed out that Collins had met with Lieutenant General Esteban Infantes, the former commander of the Spanish army who cooperated with the German Wehrmacht on the Soviet-German front in 1941, in mid-December last year. Shortly after Collins left Madrid, Franco, in a conversation with reporters, expressed his willingness to send Spanish troops to Korea.

    李承晚匪帮政府在十五日向伪“国会”提出一九五三会计年度预算，预算总额共达七万二千六百亿南朝鲜元。据美联社汉城十九日电引一位伪政府官员的话说，今年度拨给伪军的经费总共将达六万亿元，即占预算总额的百分之八十三点二强。
    李承晚匪帮将如何应付它的庞大支出呢？伪代理国务总理白斗镇说，其中二万一千五百五十亿元将为“韩国政府本身的收入”，也就是说，从已经十分困苦的南朝鲜人民身上继续榨取。此外，白斗镇承认，预算总数中的百分之六十以上要赖美国和“联合国”的援助。
