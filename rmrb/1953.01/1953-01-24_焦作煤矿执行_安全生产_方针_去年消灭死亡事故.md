    Jiaozuo Coal Mine Implements "Safe Production" Policy
    Eliminating Fatal Accidents Last Year

    The state-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine, implementing the "Safe Production" policy, eliminated fatal accidents and reduced work-related injuries in 1952. It also completed its annual production increase and conservation target, exceeding the original plan by 10.31 percent.

    Since 1950, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine has consistently included safety as an important criterion in setting production targets, evaluating model workers, and even assessing wages and comparing skills. It also regularly rewards "Safe Production" model workers and conducts regular inspections of safety work on a quarterly, monthly, and production-stage basis. As a result, injuries and fatalities have decreased year by year over the past three years. Regarding fatal accidents alone: in 1949, the death rate was 0.48 people per 10,000 tons of coal; in the first half of 1950, it was 0.33 people; and in 1951, it was 0.29 people. More than one hundred "Liu Jiuxue"-style safe production teams, five "Wang Jinsheng"-style thousand-day accident-free teams, and the "Xiong Delin" more than nine hundred-day safe operation team have emerged. In the past, some people believed that safety and completing the production task were incompatible. Now these erroneous views have been changed, and many practices that put safety and production in opposition have been corrected in a timely manner.

    Jiaozuo Coal Mine has also implemented the "Safe Production" policy in promoting advanced experiences. Of the 31 advanced experiences promoted by the mine in 1952, 24 could completely guarantee safe production.

    焦作煤矿执行“安全生产”方针
    去年消灭死亡事故
    【新华社二十三日讯】国营焦作煤矿执行“安全生产”的方针，在一九五二年内消灭了死亡事故，减少了工伤；并完成了全年增产节约任务，超过原计划百分之十点三一。
    焦作煤矿从一九五○年起，该矿在布置生产任务时，评选生产模范时，甚至在评工资、比技术时，都把安全列为评选标准的重要的一条。并定期奖励
    “安全生产”模范，经常按季、按月、按生产阶段检查安全工作。因此，三年多来伤亡事故逐年减少。仅就死亡事故来说：一九四九年每出万吨煤死亡零点四八人，一九五○年上半年为零点三三人，
    一九五一年为零点二九人，出现了一百多个刘九学式的安全生产组，王金声等五个千日无事故组，熊德林九百多天安全运转小组。过去有些人认为要完成生产任务就不能安全，要安全就不能完成生产任务，现在这些错误的看法改变了，许多把安全和生产对立起来的作法及时纠正了。
    焦作煤矿在推广先进经验方面，也贯彻了“安全生产”的方针。该矿在一九五二年推广的三十一种先进经验中，有二十四种可以完全保证安全生产。
