Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 30th. While actively plotting new military adventures, the American aggressors are intensifying their indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in northern Korea. During the first twenty-five days of January this year, the U.S. Air Force consecutively and frantically bombed Pyongyang City and the Pyongyang suburbs, as well as Longgang, Chengchuan, Shunchuan, Yongrou, Yangde in South Pyongan Province, Bochuan in North Pyongan Province, Xichuan, Qianchuan in Jagang Province, Hamhung, Jeongpyeong, Hongwon, and Gowon in South Hamgyong Province, Wonsan in Gangwon Province, and Sariwon in Hwanghae Province.

In order to slaughter more peaceful residents, the U.S. Air Force has increased the number of nighttime bombings. They are also dropping various small bombs resembling toys, specifically designed to kill children. The Korean people hate the atrocities of the American aggressors and are determined to strengthen their support for the front lines, giving the American bandits, who are deliberately expanding the war of aggression, an even heavier blow.

    美机疯狂滥炸朝鲜和平城乡
    【新华社平壤三十日电】美国侵略者在积极策划新军事冒险的同时，正加紧滥炸朝鲜北部和平城乡。在今年一月份的头二十五天中，美国空军接连疯狂地轰炸平壤市和平壤郊区，以及平安南道的龙冈、成川、顺川、永柔、阳德，平安北道的博川，慈江道的熙川、前川，咸镜南道的咸兴、定平、洪原、高原，江原道的元山和黄海道的沙里院等地。
    为了更多地屠杀和平居民，美国空军增加了夜间轰炸的次数。他们并投下类似玩具的各式小型炸弹，专门用来杀害儿童。朝鲜人民痛恨美国侵略者的暴行，并决心加强支援前线，给蓄意扩大侵略战争的美国强盗以更重的打击。
