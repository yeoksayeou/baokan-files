Introducing the "Cyclical Memorization Method" for Russian Vocabulary
    ——An Important Method for Rapidly Mastering Russian Professional Books
    Li Tian'en

    In the past, I studied English and French; and in order to read professional (chemistry) books, I also taught myself Japanese and German. In July 1952, I began to teach myself Russian. During my studies, I summarized my past experiences in learning foreign languages and constantly explored, finally finding an effective method for memorizing Russian vocabulary. In less than a month, I not only mastered the basic grammar but also memorized about four thousand new words, allowing me to read general Russian chemistry books almost without a dictionary. The method I used was the "Cyclical Memorization Method."

    In September 1952, the Russian Professional Book Reading Crash Course at Peking University used the "Cyclical Memorization Method." The results of the experiment were extremely good. Students with a slight foundation in Russian could memorize about 100 new words per hour. In October, all professional groups in the crash course widely promoted this method and achieved good results. For example, before using this method, physics students memorized an average of 30 to 40 new words per hour; after using this method, the initial average number of words memorized per hour increased to 55 to 60, and later increased to 70 to 100. Wang Hengwen, a student in the biology group, memorized 170 to 180 words per hour after using the "Cyclical Memorization Method," and memorized a total of more than 3,200 new words in 25 days, and read a Russian book on the function of the brain.

    Why does the "Cyclical Memorization Method" help us memorize more new words in a short period of time? A person's memory has a certain limit. A new impression enters the brain, and if it is not reviewed in time, it will be quickly forgotten. However, if it can be reviewed in time, once or twice, before the impression fades, it can be completely remembered. For example, if you memorize a phone number this morning, you may have forgotten it by the evening; but if you review it a few minutes after memorizing it, and then review it again an hour later, you may be able to remember the phone number until the next day; if you review it again the next day, the impression will be even deeper, and you may be able to remember it for many days. If you review it again in the future and use it to make several phone calls, you may be able to remember it for a long time. Memory increases continuously with the number of reviews. Everyone has this experience in daily life. Here, we can take the example of ordinary people memorizing common Russian new words to explain further. After the first encounter, one can remember for a few seconds to a few tens of seconds. After the second encounter, the new word can be remembered for a few minutes. Subsequent memory increases with the number of reviews. This is the "periodic increase" of memory. Secondly, we should pay attention to a phenomenon: if you recite a new word for ten minutes in one go, it is definitely not as effective as reciting it ten times, one minute each time. This proves that adopting the "Cyclical Memorization Method" can help us memorize more new words.

    The content of the "Cyclical Memorization Method" is to organize new words and recite them in rotation and cycles. When reciting cyclically, it is necessary to: First, after reciting a new word, immediately relax it and shift your attention to the new word below, and think about it again when it cycles back to this new word; Second, the time between the second encounter with each new word and the first encounter is very short, the third time is further from the second time, and the fourth time is even further from the third time... The "queuing" method of new words can be determined according to the specific circumstances of the students. Here are only two methods of "queuing" new words:

    The first "queuing" method is relatively simple. The number of new words in each small team is suitable for three to five when learning initially. To give an example, if three words are taken as a small team, the specific steps are: First, learn words number one to three (this is "small team learning"); Second, "review" words number one to three (this is "small team review").

    After the three words in the first small team have met twice, they can be remembered for a longer time. At this time, you can proceed to the third step: learn words number four to six; Fourth, "review" words number four to six; Fifth, "review" words number one to six (this is "mid-team review").

    Now, each word in the first mid-team (numbers one to six) has been seen three times and can be remembered for a longer time. We can proceed to the sixth step: follow the procedures of steps one to five to recite words number seven to twelve; Seventh, "review" words number one to twelve (this is "large team review").

    Repeat this cycle, from "small team," "mid-team," "large team," "regiment team," "special team" all the way to "total team." In the process, we can adopt the method of "advancing in pairs," that is, after reciting two "small teams," conduct "one mid-team review"; after reciting two "mid-teams," conduct one "large team review." Each total team has ninety-six new words, and the learning time is about one hour, with each new word encountered seven times. After memorizing, the new words of the "total team" can be put aside and reviewed once after twenty-four hours, and then reviewed again after thirty or forty hours.

    The second method adopts unfixed "mid-teams." The steps are as follows: First, learn and "review" words number one to three; Second, learn and "review" words number four to six; Third, "review" words number one to six; Fourth, learn and "review" words number seven to nine; Fifth, "review" words number four to nine. Recite to number twenty-four as a "large team," conduct a "large team review" and put it aside, and then recite numbers twenty-five to forty-eight..., recite to number ninety-six as a "total team." The entire "review" can be carried out after twenty-four hours. (The first and last small teams in each large team are recited one less time than the middle small teams, and should be reviewed with emphasis after the "large team review.")

    As the method becomes more proficient, we can gradually increase the number of words in each small team to fifteen or sixteen, or even twenty or thirty; we can also gradually simplify the "organization" within the total team to increase the amount of vocabulary memorized per unit of time. In fact, only when the number of words in the "small team" increases to five or six, or even ten or more, can the maximum efficiency of the "Cyclical Memorization Method" be gradually realized.

    Some words, because we lack a clear understanding of their meaning, or because their structure is complex and difficult to grasp, become "troublesome words." Generally speaking, these words require more cyclical review to be remembered. Therefore, during the "mid-team" or "large team review," we can "dismiss" them and assign them as new words to the following team. After studying to a certain stage, we can put the most "troublesome" words together and review them from the beginning using the "Cyclical Memorization Method."

    Particularly easy new words can also be "dismissed" during the "mid-team" or "large team review" and wait for them to "return to the team" when conducting the "total team" review.

    When using the "Cyclical Memorization Method," the following points should be noted:

    First, before using the "Cyclical Memorization Method" to memorize new words, you must fully master the alphabet, pronunciation, and syllables. This is very important, otherwise it will affect the efficiency of memory.

    Second, after our first encounter with a new word, we must obtain a very clear impression to prevent it from becoming a "troublesome word." To gain a deeper impression of a new word, we must first pay attention to analyzing its root, prefix, and suffix. If this work is done well, we can memorize the new word firmly by simply reciting it a few times. The most effective method for learning vocabulary is to first learn the root, then learn simple derivatives and compound words, and then learn complex derivatives and compound words.

    Third, some comrades recite new words very slowly because they do not see the entire new word at a glance. Instead, they first figure out each letter in the new word, and then organize it in their minds to obtain the outline of the entire new word. This is a bad habit and should be corrected. Also, some comrades make a mistake with the stress when they first start reciting a new word and then continue to be wrong until the end. We must also pay attention to correcting this.

    Fourth, initially, you can use flashcards to memorize new words. After completing the "small team review" and "mid-team review," the order of the new words in the "small team" and "mid-team" can be scrambled... Later, when you remember faster, the use of flashcards becomes very inconvenient and will hinder the speed of memory. At this time, you should develop the habit of reciting new words directly from a vocabulary list. At this time, pay attention: when looking at a new word, do not think about the words above and below it. When reviewing, you can recite from top to bottom, from bottom to top, from the middle to both sides, changing the order.

    Fifth, in the beginning, memorizing new words only requires "understanding": when you see a new word, you understand its meaning, and do not have excessive expectations.

    Sixth, you must concentrate when learning. Flashcards should be pre-cut. If you encounter difficulties in pronunciation and analysis of new words, you can ask the teacher to lead you in reciting a few times, then analyze the new words, and then use the "Cyclical Memorization Method" for learning.

    Finally, I would also like to say a few words: the "Cyclical Memorization Method" is not only suitable for learning Russian vocabulary, but can also be applied to the learning of other languages. For example, teachers and students of the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University have used this learning method in various Oriental language studies with good results. Secondly, when using this method, you must determine the "queuing" method, number of words, and number of cycles according to the students' learning situation. The specific steps are not fixed.

    介绍俄文生词“循环记忆法”
    ——俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习的一个重要方法
    李天恩
    过去，我学过英文和法文；为了阅读专业（化学）书籍，我还自学过日文和德文。一九五二年七月，我开始自学俄文。在学习中，我一方面总结了过去学外国语文的经验，一方面不断摸索，终于找出了记忆俄文生词的有效方法。在不到一个月的时间内，我不仅初步掌握了基本语法，还记住了四千个左右的生词，可以基本上脱离字典阅读一般俄文化学书籍。我所用的方法就是“循环记忆法”。
    一九五二年九月间，北京大学俄文专业书籍阅读速成班运用了“循环记忆法”，试验结果，极为良好，稍具俄文基础的同学，每小时可记生词一百个左右。十月间速成班各专业组普遍推广了这个方法，获得良好成绩。例如物理组学员在运用这一方法以前平均每人每小时记生词三十至四十个；运用这一方法以后，初期每人每小时平均识字数增至五十五至六十个，后期更增至七十至一百个。生物组学员王蘅文运用“循环记忆法”后，每小时记忆量达到一百七八十个，二十五天中共记住生词三千二百余个，并阅读了一本有关大脑作用的俄文书。
    “循环记忆法”为什么能帮助我们在短期内记住较多的生词呢？人的记忆力是有一定限度的，一个新的印象印入脑中，如不及时温习，很快就会忘记；但如果能在印象尚未消逝的时候，及时地一次两次地加以复习，就能够把它完全记住。比如，今天早上你记住一个电话号码，晚上你再想，可能已经忘了；但是如果你在记住它之后的数分钟内温习一次，再过一小时又温习一次，就可能把这个电话号码记到第二天；第二天再温习一次，它的印象就更为深刻，可能好多天都能记得。以后如再温习，再用它打数次电话，就可能很长久地把它记住。记忆力就是这样随着复习的次数而不断地增进。每个人在日常生活中都有这种经验。这里可以一般人记普通俄文生词为例，再来作些说明，第一次认识后，约可记几秒钟到几十秒钟，经过第二次见面，生词即可记住几分钟，以后的记忆力则随着复习次数的多少而增进。这就是记忆的“周期递增”。其次，我们要注意到一种现象，就是假如把一个生词一口气念十分钟，一定不如分十次，每次念一分钟记得牢固。这就证明，采用“循环记忆法”，是能够帮助我们记住更多的生词的。
    “循环记忆法”的内容，就是把生词组织起来，轮流、循环地背诵。循环背诵时，必须做到：第一，念完一个生词，立刻把它放松，将注意力转移到下面的生词上，等循环到这一个生词时，再重新想它；第二，每一生词第二次见面距第一次见面的时间很近，第三次距第二次较远，第四次距第三次更远……。生词的“排队”法，可以根据学员的具体情况来决定。这里仅介绍两种生词“排队”的方法：
    第一种“排队”法比较简单，每小队生词数，初学时以三至五个为适宜。举一个例子来说，如果以三个字为一小队，其具体步骤是：第一步，学习一至三号生词（这就是“小队学习”）；第二步，“检阅”一至三号生词（这就是“小队检阅”）。
    第一小队三个字在见面两次以后，可以记住较长的时间，这时就可以进行第三步，学习四至六号生词；第四步，“检阅”四至六号生词；第五步，“检阅”一至六号生词（这就是“中队检阅”）。
    现在，第一中队（一至六号）里每一个字都见过了三次面，可以记住更长的时间，我们就可以进行第六步，依照第一至第五步手续念七至十二号生词；第七步，“检阅”一至十二号生词（这就是
    “大队检阅”）
    如此往复循环，由“小队”、“中队”、“大队”、“联队”、“特队”一直到“总队”。进行中我们可以采取“二二相进”的办法，即念完两“小队”，即做“一次中队检阅”；念了两“中队”，即做一次“大队检阅”。每总队有九十六个生词，学习时间约用一小时，每个生词见面七次。记完后，即可将该“总队”的生词放在一边，过二十四小时复习一次，过三、四十小时再复习一次。
    第二种方法采取不固定的“中队”，其步骤如下：第一步，学习并“检阅”一至三号生词；第二步，学习并“检阅”四至六号生词；第三步，“检阅”一至六号生词；第四步，学习并“检阅”七至九号生词；第五步，“检阅”四至九号生词。念至二十四号为一“大队”，作一次“大队检阅”后把它放在一边，然后再念二十五——四十八号……，念满九十六号为一“总队”。整个“检阅”则可在二十四小时以后进行。（每大队内首尾两小队比中间各小队少念一次，应在“大队检阅”后有重点地复习。）
    随着方法的熟练，我们可以逐渐把每小队的字数增加到十五、六个以至二、三十个；也可以逐渐简化总队内的“编制”，以增加单位时间内的生词记忆量。事实上，只有在“小队”字数增加到五、六个以至十几个时，“循环记忆法”的最高效率才能逐渐发挥出来。
    有些字，因为我们对它的意义缺乏清楚的了解，或者因为它的构造复杂较难掌握，这就形成了“捣蛋字”。这种字一般说来需要较多次的循环复习才能记住。因此，在“中队”或“大队检阅”时，我们可以把它“开除”，当新字编到下面去。学习到一定阶段以后，可以把最“捣蛋”的字集中在一起，从头用“循环记忆法”复习。
    特别容易的生词，在“中队”或“大队检阅”时，也可以把它“开除”出来，等进行“总队”复习时，再叫它们“归队”。
    运用“循环记忆法”时，应该注意下列几点：
    第一，在用“循环记忆法”记忆生词以前，必需完全掌握字母、发音、音节。这一点是很重要的，否则就会影响记忆的效率。
    第二，我们和生词第一次见面后，就必须取得很鲜明的印象，使它不易成为“捣蛋字”。对一个生词要取得一个较深的印象，首先必须注意分析它的词根、词首、词尾。如果做好了这一工作，我们只要循环念几遍就可把生词记牢。学生词的最有效方法，是先学词根，后学简单的衍生词和复合词，再及于复杂的衍生词和复合词。
    第三，有的同志念生词时速度很慢，这是因为，他不是一眼看到整个生词，而是先捉摸生词里的每一个字母，然后在脑筋里把它组织一下，这才得到整个生词的轮廓。这是一个不好的习惯，要改掉。还有的同志，一开始念生词时，就把重音搞错了，以后就一直错到底。这一点我们也要注意纠正。
    第四，最初学习时，可以用卡片记忆生词。做完“小队检阅”、“中队检阅”后，该“小队”、“中队”内生词的次序即可打乱……，以后记得快了，卡片的运用就很不便，它会妨碍记忆的速度，这时就要养成直接用词表背生词的习惯。这时要注意：看一个生词时，不要去想上下的生词。复习时，可以由上而下，由下而上，由中间而两旁，调换着念。
    第五，记生词最初只要求“一会”：见到生词，就懂得它的意思，不能有过高的要求。
    第六，学习时精神必须集中。卡片要预先裁好。倘在发音和生词的分析上遇到困难时，可请教员先带念几遍，再分析生词，然后用“循环记忆法”进行学习。
    最后，我还要说几句话，“循环记忆法”不仅适用于俄文生词的学习，还可运用到其他的语文学习上去。例如北京大学东方语文系的教师和同学，在各种不同的东方语文学习中运用了此种学习方法，效果很好。其次，运用这一方法时，必须随着学员的学习情况来决定生词的“排队”方法、字数以及循环的次数等等。其具体步骤不是一成不变的。
