    Suggestion to Educate Cadres at All Levels on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Editor: I am a special correspondent for the Nanjing Xinhua Daily and an active correspondent for the New Suzhou Daily. After reading the report on the Huang Yifeng incident, I deeply felt the Party's selflessness and impartiality. However, the issue of criticism and self-criticism has not received due attention in the minds of some cadres. Last year, I criticized an incident in my organization and was subjected to unreasonable suppression by the leadership (the matter has now been dealt with). Now, as our country's large-scale economic construction begins, in order to eliminate the harm of bureaucratic germs and fully carry out criticism and self-criticism, I suggest that Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels consider conducting a broad and in-depth education on criticism and self-criticism among cadres. In particular, a study of the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications." In the future, under the leadership of the Party, I will continue to expose the bad people and bad deeds that I know, so as to give full play to the role of our newspaper correspondents in national construction.

    建议在各级干部中进行关于开展批评和自我批评的教育
    编辑同志：我是南京新华日报的特约通讯员，是新苏州报的通讯员积极分子。当我看到关于黄逸峰事件的报道后，深深感到党的大公无私。但是批评与自我批评的问题，在某些干部思想中还没有引起应有的重视。去年我批评了我所在机关的一件事，就曾经遭受到领导上的无理的压制（那事现已处理）。现在正当我国大规模经济建设开始，为了扫除官僚主义病菌的毒害，为了充分开展批评与自我批评，我建议各级党组织和人民政府考虑在干部中广泛地深入地进行一次关于开展批评和自我批评的教育。特别是学习一次中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”。今后，我一定在党的领导下，继续揭发我所知道的坏人坏事，以充分发挥我们报纸通讯员在国家建设中的作用。  周盘寿
