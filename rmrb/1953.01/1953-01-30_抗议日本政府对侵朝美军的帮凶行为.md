    Protest Against the Japanese Government's Accomplice Behavior in the American Invasion of Korea

    On January 22nd, Chinese personnel who had escaped from the American POW camp on Geoje Island and safely reached Tsushima Island in Japan were arrested by police dispatched by the Japanese government on the island and illegally handed over to the U.S. military police of the invading Korean forces. This behavior of the Japanese government once again demonstrates that it is a shameful accomplice of the American forces invading Korea. The Chinese people lodge a serious protest against this crime of the Japanese government.

    The POW camps of the American forces invading Korea are notorious hellholes. The American aggressors violated the provisions of the Geneva Convention, subjecting our captured personnel to all kinds of cruel abuse, using them as experimental subjects for various poisonous weapons, and constantly creating bloody tragedies, massacring them on a large scale. According to publicly reported American figures and reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross, since the start of the Korean armistice negotiations, over three thousand of our captured personnel have been killed or wounded in American POW camps. Geoje Island, where the Americans detain prisoners of war, is even called the "Island of Death" by American reporters. Our captured personnel have waged heroic and moving resistance against the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors and resolutely escaped from the American POW camps in order to return to the embrace of the motherland. However, the Japanese government mobilized armed police to arrest our captured personnel who had already escaped from the American "Island of Death" and handed them back to the American murderers. This fully proves that the Japanese government is an accomplice of the American aggressors.

    This shameless crime of the Japanese government is a complete violation of international conventions and international practices. Article 13 of the Hague Convention of 1907, signed by Japan, concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in War on Land, clearly stipulates: "A neutral Power which receives escaped prisoners of war shall leave them at liberty; but may assign them a place of residence, should they allow them to remain on its territory." Article 91 of the 1949 Geneva Convention stipulates: "A prisoner of war who has succeeded in escaping and has reached territory under the control of the Detaining Power or of an ally of that Power" shall be regarded as having completed his escape. Japan is a non-belligerent country in the Korean War, but the Japanese government blatantly disregards the provisions of international conventions and hands over our escaped captured personnel to the American forces invading Korea. This is a completely open act of hostility towards the Chinese and Korean people. At the same time, the Yoshida reactionary government of Japan is willing to be controlled by the United States and is directly involved in the actual actions of the American war of aggression against Korea, which is a serious harm to the interests of the Japanese people as a non-belligerent country in the Korean War.

    The Japanese government attempts to use the excuse of "illegal entry" of our captured personnel to shirk its responsibility for violating international conventions. This is obviously extremely absurd. This cannot conceal its accomplice role in the American war of aggression against Korea. In a press conference on January 6 this year, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida publicly stated that he would guarantee Japan's "unlimited cooperation" with the American war of aggression against Korea. According to Japanese newspaper reports, the Yoshida government dispatched one thousand Japanese "Police Reserve Force" personnel, originally stationed in Soumagahara, Gunma Prefecture, Japan, to Korea in July last year to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo, the Japanese Yoshida government also transferred two platoons of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, to Geoje Island in July last year to help the American aggressors persecute Chinese and Korean captured personnel. Now, the Japanese government has violated international conventions by illegally arresting our escaped captured personnel and handing them over to the American forces invading Korea, which is obviously a continuation of its crime of being an accomplice to the American forces invading Korea. This cannot but arouse the extreme indignation of the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world. The Japanese government must bear all responsibility for the consequences caused by this crime.

### 抗议日本政府对侵朝美军的帮凶行为

    抗议日本政府对侵朝美军的帮凶行为
    一月二十二日由巨济岛美方战俘营脱逃的我方被俘人员，在安全到达日本对马岛之后，竟遭该岛日本政府所派遣的警察所逮捕，并把他们非法移交给侵朝美军军事警察。日本政府的这种行为再次表现了它是侵朝美军的可耻帮凶。中国人民对日本政府的这种罪行提出严重的抗议。
    侵朝美军的战俘营是人所共知的人间地狱。美国侵略者违反日内瓦公约的规定，对我方被俘人员施行了种种残酷虐待，把他们作为各种有毒武器的实验品，并不断制造血腥惨案，大规模地加以屠杀。仅据美方公开报道和红十字国际委员会的报告，自朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，在美方战俘营中被打死打伤的我方被俘人员已达三千名以上。美方拘留战俘的巨济岛，甚至连美国记者也把它称为“死亡之岛”。我方被俘人员对美国侵略者的血腥暴行进行了可歌可泣的英勇抵抗，并坚决逃出美方战俘营，以便重返祖国的怀抱。但是日本政府却动员武装警察逮捕了已经逃出美方“死亡之岛”的我方被俘人员，并把他们交回到美国杀人犯的手中。这完全证明了日本政府是美国侵略者的同谋犯。
    日本政府这种无耻的罪行，是完全违反国际公约和国际惯例的。一九○七年由日本参加签订的海牙保和会议公约关于陆战时中立国及其人民之权利义务条约的第十三条曾明确规定：“中立国收容逃亡之战俘，应听其自由；倘准其在境内逗留，可指定其住处。”一九四九年日内瓦公约第九十一条规定：“已离开拘留国或其盟国所控制之领土”的战俘即应认为其脱逃已经完成。日本是朝鲜战争的非交战国，但日本政府却悍然不顾国际公约的规定，将已完成脱逃的我方被俘人员移交给侵朝美军。这完全是对中朝人民的公开的敌对行为。同时，日本吉田反动政府甘心受美国的控制，并且直接被牵入到美国侵朝战争的实际行动中去，这对于作为朝鲜战争的非交战国的日本人民的利益，更是严重的危害。
    日本政府企图以我被俘人员“非法入境”为借口，来卸脱它破坏国际公约的罪责。这显然是极端荒谬的。这无论如何掩饰不了它在美国侵朝战争中的帮凶作用。日本政府首相吉田茂于今年一月六日在记者招待会上发表的谈话中便曾公开表示：保证日本对美国所进行的侵朝战争进行“无限的合作”。据日本报纸的报道，吉田政府在去年七月即曾将原来驻在日本群马县相马原的日本
    “警察后备队”一千人派赴朝鲜，参加侵朝战争。又据塔斯社的东京消息，日本吉田政府并曾于去年七月从日本山口县调了两排日本“警察后备队”，派赴巨济岛，帮助美国侵略者迫害中朝被俘人员。现在，日本政府又违反国际公约将已脱逃的我方被俘人员非法逮捕并移交给侵朝美军，这显然是它为侵朝美军帮凶罪行的继续发展。这不能不引起中朝人民及全世界爱好和平人民的极度愤慨。日本政府必须对它这一罪行所引起的后果担负一切责任。
