(Our Newspaper) News: Recently, extremely chaotic phenomena have occurred in many construction engineering units in Beijing.

Since the second half of last year, with the increase in basic construction tasks, the number of construction units and construction workers in Beijing has increased sharply. Up to now, there are sixteen larger construction engineering companies or engineering offices, with over 40,000 fixed construction workers. Some of these units were formed by merging past agency production entities. Some were hastily formed or suddenly expanded recently. The number of workers has increased, their composition is complex, and there is a lack of backbone personnel. The cadres in some units are weak, lacking experience in leading such a large construction force. In addition, the administrative systems are inconsistent, the leadership of Party and Youth League work is not unified, and the phenomenon of some leading cadres having no government or discipline is extremely serious. Each unit acts on its own, each doing its own thing. Even within a single engineering unit, there is a lack of overall planning, sometimes doing this, sometimes doing that. They even announce plans and handle wage issues without the approval of the leading organs, creating some extremely inconsistent, unreasonable, and chaotic phenomena in terms of wages, benefits, and work systems. The leading organs of Beijing Municipality have not promptly inspected and dealt with the problems and errors existing in various units, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of construction workers and has begun to be exploited by bad elements to incite trouble and engage in sabotage.

There are many unreasonable and seriously erroneous aspects to the wages, benefits, and rewards in Beijing's construction units. For example, wage grades are fifteen in centrally-administered engineering companies, twelve in the North China Directly Subordinate First Construction Engineering Company, and sixteen in the Beijing Construction Company. In addition, without reasonable and consistent technical standards, many workers with the same skills not only have large wage differences in different units, but also are extremely inconsistent even within the same unit. For example, the Beijing Construction Company has eleven different wage levels for sixth-grade carpenters. Most unreasonably, some people with low technical skills, and even very poor work attitudes, have higher wages; while some good workers with high technical skills and good work attitudes, who should have higher wages, now have relatively lower wages. Reward methods are even more varied, even inconsistent within a single company. For example, the task quota for rebar workers' over-task rewards in the City Construction Company is set at twelve workdays to tie one ton of rebar on some construction sites, eighteen workdays on others, and twenty-two workdays on still others. Another example is the wage difference between temporary and fixed workers. In the past, the wages of temporary workers in the city were generally about 8% to 10% higher than those of fixed workers, which was reasonable because temporary workers were laid off in winter when construction could not be carried out, while fixed workers had to be paid their wages. When the North China Directly Subordinate First Construction Engineering Company changed temporary workers to fixed workers last winter, it did not ask its superiors or the Municipal Labor Bureau for instructions, but maintained the wages of temporary workers, but the wages of the company's original fixed workers did not change. Thus, within one company, the same fixed workers had two different wage standards simply because of the different times they joined, which further deepened the wage confusion. Another example is the calculation of wages. In September of last year, the Municipal Labor Bureau and various engineering units, in order to take care of the workers' lives and reduce the trouble of calculation when paying wages, uniformly converted wages into monetary wages according to the then-current wage point value, but due to price adjustments, the wage point value has changed in recent months, while various engineering units still pay wages according to the monetary amount converted in September, thus invisibly reducing the workers' actual wages. All these problems have aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers.

The reason for the chaotic phenomena in Beijing's construction units is also due to the serious bureaucratic style of some cadres in certain construction units, who have long only used workers simply, lacked political education, were indifferent to the workers' lives, and did not understand the work situation. For example, the leading cadres of the City Construction Company did not even know how many construction sites the company had or how many section-chief level cadres there were. Due to the lack of in-depth leadership work, some lower-level cadres arbitrarily did whatever they wanted. For example, a personnel officer at a construction site of the Civil Engineering Company of the North China Electric Power Administration told the workers: "Whoever lends me money, I will promote to permanent worker; whoever treats me to dinner, I will transfer to formal worker." Another personnel officer at a certain construction site openly sold application forms for long-term workers for 150,000 yuan each. These corrupt and lawless acts of these bad elements aroused great resentment and dissatisfaction among the workers.

In addition, some leading cadres, when handling specific issues such as wages, benefits, and rewards, not only lacked a policy perspective, but also had a serious phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline, making decisions without asking the higher-level leading organs. For example, in the issue of wage evaluation, some leading cadres did not seriously prepare the conditions for wage evaluation, but casually announced "wage evaluation twice a year," "a small evaluation every three months and a large evaluation every five months," irresponsibly making empty promises, and then leaving the promises aside without asking about them, so that problems that should have been solved were not solved for a long time.

The reason for the chaotic phenomena in Beijing's construction units is also due to the serious impurity of the ranks of construction workers. The vast majority of the current construction workers are truly skilled or good workers with the habit of manual labor, but it is undeniable that due to the rapid development of our basic construction team and the chaotic leadership, a very small number of bad elements have also taken the opportunity to infiltrate our construction workers' ranks. They wear workers' clothes, carry the glorious banner of workers, and secretly engage in various sabotage activities, tarnishing the reputation of construction workers. However, as long as the majority of construction workers recognize the true faces of these bad elements, their sabotage activities will surely fail.

Now, the Construction Engineering Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee and the Beijing Municipal People's Government have decided to give Ni Nongpan, manager of the North China Directly Subordinate First Construction Engineering Company, and Li Gongxia and Zhang Hongshun, the manager and deputy manager of the Beijing Construction Company, a major demerit each. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government also convened meetings of relevant units on the 17th, 20th, and 23rd of this month to study solutions to the above-mentioned chaos, vigorously carry out rectification, and severely criticize the bureaucratic style of some unit leaders who do not understand the situation of the masses and do not care about the lives of the workers.

    北京各建筑单位情况混乱
    中共北京市委和市人民政府大力进行整顿
    【本报讯】近来，北京很多建筑工程单位发生极端混乱的现象。
    自去年下半年起，随着基本建设任务的加重，北京市的建筑单位和建筑工人骤然增加很多。到目前为止，较大的建筑工程公司或工程处已达十六个，固定建筑工人已达四万多人。这些单位中，有些是由过去的机关生产合并组成的。有些是在最近仓促组成或突然发展起来的。工人数量增加，成分复杂，缺乏骨干。有些单位的干部很弱，缺乏领导这样一支庞杂的建设大军的经验。加以行政系统不一，党团工作的领导不统一，有些领导干部无政府无纪律的现象极为严重，各单位各自为政，各搞一套，在一个工程单位内部，也缺乏通盘的计划，时而这样，时而那样。甚至不经领导机关批准，乱宣布计划，乱处理工资等问题，在工资、福利及工作制度等问题上造成了一些极不一致、极不合理和极为混乱的现象。北京市的领导机关对于各单位所存在的问题和错误，又未及时加以检查和处理，以致引起了建筑工人的不满，并开始被坏分子利用来乘机进行挑拨，从事破坏活动。
    北京市各建筑单位在工资、福利以及奖励等问题上，有很多不合理和严重错误的地方。如工资等级，在中央直属工程公司为十五级，华北直属第一建筑工程公司为十二级，北京市建筑公司为十六级。再加上没有合理的一致的技术标准，因而使许多具有同等技术的工人，不仅在不同的单位中工资有了很大的差别，甚至在一个单位之内也极不一致，如北京市建筑公司六级木工的工资就有十一种之多。最不合理的是有些技术水准低的，甚至劳动态度也极坏的人，工资反而高；而有些技术水准高，劳动态度也很好，工资应该比较高的好工人，现在反而工资比较低。在奖励办法上更是各有一套，甚至在一个公司内部也不一致，如市建筑公司铁筋工超任务奖的任务定额，有的工地订为十二个工扎一吨铁筋，有的是十八个工扎一吨，还有的是二十二个工扎一吨。又如临时工与固定工的工资差额问题。过去本市临时工的工资一般约比固定工的工资高百分之八到百分之十，这是合理的，因为在冬季不能施工时临时工即解雇，而固定工则须照付工资。华北直属第一建筑工程公司，在去冬把临时工改为固定工时既不请示其上级也不请示市劳动局，却保持了临时工的工资，但是该公司原固定工的工资却并未变动，于是在一个公司内同样是固定工仅仅因为参加先后的不同，即有了两种标准不同的工资，这就更加深了工资方面的混乱现象。再如关于工资的计算问题。去年九月间市劳动局和各工程单位为了照顾工人的生活并减少发工资时计算的麻烦，曾按当时的工资分值一律折合为货币工资，但由于物价调整的结果，近几月来工资分值变了，而各工程单位却仍按九月份所折算成的货币额发工资，因而就无形中降低了工人的实际工资。所有这些问题都引起了工人的不满。
    北京市各建筑单位发生混乱现象的原因，还由于在某些建筑单位的部分干部中，存在着严重的官僚主义作风，长期对工人只图单纯使用，缺乏政治教育，对工人的生活漠不关心，对工作的情况也不了解。如市建筑公司的领导干部连该公司共有多少工地，有多少科长级以上的干部都不知道。由于领导工作的不深入，因而某些下层干部便任意胡作非为。如华北电业管理局土木工程公司某工地的人事员向工人说：“谁借给我钱，我给谁升长工；谁请我客，我给谁转正式工。”还有某工地人事员公开出卖长期工申请表，每张十五万元。这些坏分子的贪赃枉法的行为，引起了工人极大的愤恨和不满。
    此外，有些领导干部在处理工资、福利、奖励等具体问题时，不但缺乏政策观点，而且有严重的无组织无纪律现象，不请示上级领导机关，擅自决定。如在评定工资的问题上，有的领导干部不是认真准备评定工资的条件，却随便宣布“一年评定两次”“三个月一小评五个月一大评”，不负责任地瞎许愿，许了愿又放在一边不加过问，以致应该解决的问题长期没有解决。
    北京市各建筑单位的混乱现象发生的原因，还由于建筑工人的队伍严重不纯。目前的建筑工人中绝大多数是真正熟练的或有体力劳动习惯的好工人，但是不可否认地，由于我们的基本建设的队伍发展很快，领导很乱，有极少数坏分子，也乘机钻进了我们建筑工人的队伍，他们穿着工人的衣服，打着光荣的工人招牌，偷偷地进行各种破坏活动，败坏建筑工人的名誉。但是，只要大多数建筑工人认识了这些坏分子的真面目，他们的破坏活动就一定要失败。
    现在，华北行政委员会建筑工程局和北京市人民政府已决定给予华北直属第一建筑工程公司经理倪弄畔及北京市建筑公司正副经理李公侠、张鸿舜每人记大过一次的处分。中共北京市委及北京市人民政府并于本月十七日、二十日、二十三日，先后召集各有关单位开会，研究解决上述混乱的办法，大力进行整顿，并严厉地批评有些单位领导者不了解群众情况，不关心工人生活的官僚主义作风。
