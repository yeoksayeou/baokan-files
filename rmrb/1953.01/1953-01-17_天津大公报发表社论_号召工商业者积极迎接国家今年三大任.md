Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch:

    Tianjin Dagongbao published an editorial entitled "How Should Industrialists and Businessmen Greet the Three Major Tasks?" The editorial first explained that in 1953, New China was facing three major tasks: strengthening the fight against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to strive for greater victories; ensuring the completion or over-completion of the first year's construction plan of the Five-Year Plan; and convening the National People's Congress to pass the Constitution. It then summarized the government's policies towards private industry and commerce: on the one hand, encouraging the active operation of economic undertakings beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; on the other hand, resolutely opposing the "five poisons" of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and the theft of state economic intelligence. The editorial pointed out: "After the 'Five-Anti' campaign, the People's Government not only solved the difficulties of industry and commerce with a large number of processing orders and bank loans, but also took a series of timely measures, so that private industry and commerce achieved further development in the second half of last year, fully demonstrating that as long as private industry and commerce obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and as long as they act honestly in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, they have a future and can make profits."
    The editorial then pointed out that the first task for private industrialists and businessmen to greet the three major tasks is to actively pay taxes in coordination with the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and to wage a merciless struggle against illegal acts of tax evasion. The editorial said: "The greatest contribution of industrialists and businessmen to the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is to abide by laws and regulations, actively pay taxes, and not evade or underreport. On the one hand, tax workers must assess taxes according to rates, handle affairs according to law, oppose coercion and commandism, and oppose bureaucracy; at the same time, industrialists and businessmen should abide by the law and pay taxes, and fulfill the obligation of conscious and voluntary patriotic tax payment! Especially after the promulgation of the new tax system, state-owned commerce and cooperatives will bear the same tax rates as private industry and commerce, and the preferential treatment enjoyed by cooperatives has also been abolished. If private industry and commerce still engage in tax evasion or trickery on the taxes they should pay, it will not only violate state laws and disciplines, but also be unfair to state-owned commerce and cooperatives."
    The editorial said: In order to cooperate with the first year's construction plan of the Five-Year Plan, the second task of private industrialists and businessmen is to improve enterprise management, strengthen enterprise technical management, improve quality, and reduce costs. Industrialists should run factories well, businessmen should do a good job in urban and rural exchanges, and promote the enthusiasm for management. The editorial quoted Chairman Mao's words: "In order to cope with the oppression of imperialism, and in order to raise the backward economic status a step, China must use all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and not harmful, and unite the national bourgeoisie to fight together." It pointed out that under the New Democratic economy, private capitalism needs to exist and be appropriately developed under the leadership of the state-owned economy, but it is not blindly spontaneous, but must be gradually incorporated into the country's economic plan. The editorial said: "Today, the focus of national construction is heavy industry. In the light industry sector, private capital still has great room for development. The development of national industry is beneficial to the improvement and development of private industry. For example, the development of the textile machinery industry can promote the development of the private textile industry. Of course, in the process of development, the proportion of the state-owned economy will increase faster, but in absolute numbers, the private economy will also increase. Therefore, the view that it is not necessary to appropriately develop private industry and commerce on the premise of the expansion of the state-owned economy has no theoretical and factual basis."
    The editorial finally called on private industrialists and businessmen to strengthen their study and improve their political level in order to cooperate with the convening of the National People's Congress. The editorial said: "The national bourgeoisie is one of the four friends today, and is a component of the people's democratic united front." "Starting this year, we will convene the National People's Congress and formulate the Constitution. There is no doubt that law-abiding industrialists and businessmen can and should participate in the election of people's representatives, and they have the right to exercise their democratic rights. We want to call on industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in this movement, do a good job in propaganda, and actually participate in action. However, this requires our industrialists and businessmen to strengthen their study and improve their political awareness and political level. Before the promulgation of the Constitution, the Common Program is still the general law that our people must abide by. In the past, friends in the industrial and commercial circles did not study the Common Program and Mao Zedong Thought enough. In order to greet the upcoming National People's Congress and elect the People's Government, the industrial and commercial circles should catch up quickly and not lag behind anymore."

### 天津大公报发表社论  号召工商业者积极迎接国家今年三大任

    天津大公报发表社论
    号召工商业者积极迎接国家今年三大任务
    【新华社十六日讯】天津大公报以“工商业者如何迎接三大任务？”为题发表社论。社论首先说明了一九五三年开始，新中国面对着加强抗美援朝，争取更大胜利；保证完成或超额完成五年计划的第一年建设计划；召开全国人民代表大会，通过宪法三项重大任务后，概括论述了人民政府对私营工商业的政策是一方面鼓励有利于国计民生的经济事业经营的积极性；另方面坚决反对行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的“五毒”行为。社论指出：“五反”以后，人民政府不但以大量的加工订货银行贷款来解决工商业的困难，还采取了一系列的及时的措施，使私营工商业在去年下半年获得了进一步的发展，充分说明了私营工商业只要他们服从工人阶级与国营经济的领导，只要他们按照共同纲领的规定规规矩矩的办事，他们是有前途的，而且是有利可图的。
    社论接着指出私营工商业者迎接三大任务第一是，为了配合抗美援朝运动踊跃纳税，向偷税漏税的不法行为进行无情的斗争。社论说：“工商业者对抗美援朝工作最大的贡献，莫过于遵守法令、踊跃纳税、不偷不漏。一方面，税务工作者要做到依率计征、依法办事、反对强迫命令、反对官僚主义；同时，工商业者应该守法纳税，履行自觉自愿爱国纳税的义务！尤其是新税制公布之后，国营商业与合作社都将与私营工商业负担同等的税率，合作社也取消了享受优待的规定。如果私营工商业对应负的税额还有偷漏取巧行为，那不仅违犯国家法纪，而且对国营商业与合作社也是太不公平了。”
    社论说：为了配合五年计划的第一年建设计划，私营工商业者的第二项任务是改善企业经营，加强企业技术管理，提高质量，降低成本。工业家办好工厂，商业家做好城乡交流，发扬经营的积极性。社论引毛主席的话：“为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。”指出在新民主主义经济下私人资本主义需要存在并在国营经济领导下适当加以发展，但并不是盲目自发，而是必须逐步地纳入国家的经济计划之中的。社论说：“今天国家建设的重心是重工业，轻工业方面，私人资本还大有发展的余地。国家工业的发展对私营工业的改进和发展是有好处的，例如纺织机械工业发展了，就可以促进私营纺织业的发展。当然在发展过程中，国营经济的比重会增加更快，但在绝对数量上，私营经济亦是会增加的。因此，认为在国营经济扩展的前提之下，不需要适当发展私营工商业的说法，是没有理论与事实根据的。”
    社论最后号召私营工商业者，为了配合全国人民代表大会的召开要加强学习，提高政治水平。社论说：“民族资产阶级今天是四个朋友之一，是人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分。”“从今年起，我们就要召开全国人民代表大会，制定宪法了。毫无疑问，守法的工商业者是可以而且应该参加人民代表的选举的，他们有权利行使他们的民主权利。我们要号召工商业者，踊跃参加到这一运动中去，做好宣传工作，实际参加行动。但是，这必须我们工商业者加强学习，提高自己的政治认识与政治水平。在宪法公布以前，共同纲领依然是我们人民共同所要遵守的大法。过去工商界朋友对共同纲领与毛泽东思想的学习是不够的，为了迎接即将召开的全国人民代表大会，民选人民政府，工商界应该急起直追，不能再落在人后了。”
