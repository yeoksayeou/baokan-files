    Commodity Stockpiling in State-Owned Trading Departments Across the Country Is Very Serious
    Occupies a Huge Amount of Funds, Causing Great Losses to the Country
    [Our Newspaper] The phenomenon of commodity stockpiling in state-owned trading departments is very serious. At present, the funds occupied by unsalable goods and substandard products stockpiled in state-owned trading departments account for 20% to 31% of the total working capital of the state-owned trading departments. The Ministry of Commerce recently focused on inspecting the stockpiling of goods in state-owned cotton yarn, general merchandise, tobacco and hemp, coal construction, communications and electricity, and hardware and chemical companies in some provinces and cities. The 157 types of unsalable goods and substandard goods stockpiled by these companies have tied up approximately 4 trillion yuan in capital. The interest, warehousing rent, and operating management expenses required for these stockpiled goods and tied-up funds amount to approximately 1 trillion yuan. If 4 trillion yuan were used to purchase steel rails, it could lay 4,400 kilometers of railway; if it were used to develop the textile industry, it could build 17 new-style textile factories with 50,000 spindles and corresponding looms; if it were used to buy airplanes, it could buy 2,666 fighter jets; if it were used to buy cannons, it could buy 4,444 cannons, or 5,000 anti-aircraft guns. And this is only a portion of the commodities stockpiled and funds tied up in state-owned trading departments.
    The reasons for commodity stockpiling are very complex.
    Some leading cadres of state-owned trading enterprises do not study the new requirements of local residents for commodity quality and variety due to improved living standards. They blindly entrust processing orders and purchase commodities that do not meet the needs of the masses, and these commodities are stockpiled. For example, workers and many farmers need patterned cloth, twill cloth, and beautiful colored cloth, but cotton yarn companies continue to entrust the processing of white, blue, and cyan cloth and low-quality native cloth, which are no longer welcomed by the residents. Approximately 1.39 million of these cloths have now been stockpiled, occupying more than 343.3 billion yuan in capital. The East China District Company of the China Cotton Yarn Company originally planned to sell more than 120,000 bolts of Chongming native cloth processed on consignment in Fujian Province, but local farmers disliked the low quality and high price of this cloth and were unwilling to buy it. As a result, this cloth has not been sold, which has tied up 12 billion yuan in state funds. The Northeast District Department Store Company's stockpiled pressure-type, long, five-eye rubber shoes produced locally are of poor quality, and many buyers have requested returns. The company's large stockpiles of cotton rubber shoes and youth sports shoes are also unsalable due to their poor quality. The company has now stockpiled more than 7 million pairs of rubber shoes, occupying more than 200 billion yuan in capital, with a loss of more than 100 billion yuan in interest, warehousing rent, and operating management expenses alone. The company purchased a large number of rolled-edge floral enamel basins produced by the Changchun Enamel Factory, but the patterns of these basins were not new and the quality was very poor, so people were unwilling to buy them, resulting in a stockpile of more than 21 billion yuan.
    A portion of the unsalable and substandard commodities that state-owned trading enterprises blindly entrust processing orders for and purchase are instructed by local financial and economic commissions and industrial and commercial administrative departments to entrust processing, place orders, and purchase in order to support certain units with backward production technology and solve the livelihood problems of some workers. For example, the "city cloth" produced by private small weaving factories in Guangzhou has high processing fees and low quality. The local cotton yarn company once suggested advising them to reduce production, but the city's financial and economic commission and industrial and commercial bureau not only did not allow production to be reduced, but instead increased the task of entrusting processing twice in succession, resulting in a stockpile of more than 50,000 bolts, which have not been sold for six months, occupying nearly 13 billion yuan. Branches of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company in various regions, following the instructions of local financial and economic commissions and industrial and commercial administrative departments, purchased low-quality coal from the Zhangcun Coal Mine in Hebei, the Xingyuan Coal Mine in Jiangxi, and the Guanyintang Coal Mine in Henan, tying up more than 230 billion yuan in capital. The Tianjin Department Store Company, following the instructions of the Municipal Financial and Economic Commission, purchased a large number of unsalable socks, tying up 17.2 billion yuan in capital. Poor management and blind allocation of goods by state-owned trading enterprises in various regions not only increased commodity losses and wasted freight, but also caused large stockpiles of goods. The China Department Store Company blindly allocated paper without knowing whether Zhejiang Province needed it, causing Zhejiang Province to stockpile paper worth more than 44.7 billion yuan. In April 1952, the China Tobacco and Hemp Company transferred 2,500 tons of jute from East China to Tianjin for export, of which 1,000 tons did not meet the specifications. After processing and sorting, 300 tons were lost (discounted at 3.1 billion yuan), but they still could not be exported; because they were not suitable for sale in North China, they had to be transported back to East China. The Southwest District Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company blindly transferred a large number of steel products from the head office in 1951 without investigating local needs. At present, approximately 8,000 tons are stockpiled, worth approximately 80 billion to 120 billion yuan. This batch of steel has been stockpiled for more than a year.
    The commodity stockpiling and loss phenomena caused by chaotic warehouse systems, inconsistent accounts and goods, and poor storage in some state-owned trading enterprises are also very serious. The Jiamusi Department Store Wholesale Station in Heilongjiang Province lacks inspection of warehouse work. The financial accounting books and storage books have never been checked, and the storage and transportation work system is very unsound. The materials allocated to various counties are often not used for the intended purpose, and the materials needed by various places cannot be allocated. As a result, the materials stockpiled by the station are often around 200 train carriages. In the warehouse of the No. 2 Store of the Benxi Department Store Company in the Northeast District, more than 40 kinds of goods are stockpiled. The company's wholesale department has not sold Donglun brand white plain towels for more than half a month, but the city company regards this kind of towel as a "cold back cargo" and has stockpiled it in the warehouse for a year. In the third quarter of last year, the Nanjing Department Store Company in Jiangsu Province transferred in 5,000 reams of typing paper, but only sold 2,000 reams. In the fourth quarter, it blindly transferred in 7,000 reams, resulting in nearly 10,000 reams of paper being stockpiled for a long time and unable to be sold.
    The staff of state-owned trading enterprises in various regions should deeply understand that the losses caused by commodity stockpiling to the country are extremely serious. Everyone should conduct in-depth inspections and thoroughly solve the problem of commodity stockpiling, strengthen management and administration, implement the economic accounting system, earnestly serve the needs of residents, and strive to save and accumulate funds for the needs of large-scale national economic construction.

    各地国营贸易部门
    积压商品现象非常严重
    占用巨量资金，给国家造成很大损失
    【本报讯】国营贸易部门的商品积压现象非常严重。目前国营贸易部门积压的滞销商品和次品所占用的资金占国营贸易部门全部流动资金的百分之二十至三十一。中央商业部最近重点检查了部分省市的国营花纱布、百货、菸麻、煤建、交电、五金、化工等公司积压商品的情况，这些公司积压的一百五十七种滞销商品和次等商品，共计搁置了四万亿元左右的资金。这些积压的商品和搁置的资金，需要付出的利息、仓租、经营管理费用即达一万亿元左右。四万亿元如果购买钢轨，可以铺四千四百公里长的铁路；如果用来发展纺织工业，可以修建十七个新式的有五万纱锭及相应的织布机设备的纺织厂；如果用来买飞机，可以买二千六百六十六架战斗机；如果用来买大炮，可以买四千四百四十四门大炮，或五千门高射炮。而这还只是国营贸易部门积压的商品和搁置的资金中的一部分。
    造成商品积压的原因是很复杂的。
    有些国营贸易企业的领导干部，不去研究当地居民群众因生活提高对商品质量和品种产生的新的要求，盲目委托加工订货和收购不适合群众需要的商品，这些商品就被积压下来了。譬如，工人和许多农民十分需要花纹布、斜纹布和漂亮的各种彩色布，但花纱布公司却仍然继续大量地委托加工已为居民群众所不欢迎的白、蓝、青布及质量低劣的土布。这些布匹现已积压一百三十九万匹左右，占用资金在三千四百三十三亿元以上。中国花纱布公司华东区公司原打算把委托加工的十二万余匹崇明土布，在福建省内售出，但当地农民嫌这种布质量次，价格高，不愿购买，结果这种布一直没有找到销路，这就积压了国家资金一百二十余亿元。东北区百货公司所积压的当地出产的压式长五眼胶鞋，因质量低劣，不少购买者纷纷要求退回。该公司大量积存的棉胶鞋、青年运动鞋，也因质量低劣，没有销路。现该公司已积压胶鞋七百余万双，占压资金在两千亿元以上，仅利息、仓租、经营管理费用就损失一千亿元以上。该公司大量收购长春搪瓷厂出产的卷边花面盆，但这种面盆花样不新鲜，质量又很坏，人们都不愿买，积压资金二百一十余亿元以上。
    各地国营贸易企业盲目委托加工订货和收购的滞销品和次等商品中，有一部分是当地财政经济委员会、工商行政部门为了扶植某些生产技术落后的单位和解决部分工人的生活问题，指示国营贸易企业委托加工、订货和收购的。例如广州市私营小型织布厂所产的“市布”，工缴高，质量低，当地花纱布公司曾提议劝其减产，但该市财政经济委员会、工商局不仅不允许减产，反先后两次把委托加工的任务增大，致成品积压五万余匹以上，至今六个月销售不出，占压资金近一百三十亿元。中国煤业建筑器材公司各地分支公司执行各地财政经济委员会、工商行政部门的指示，收购了河北章村煤矿、江西兴袁煤矿、河南观音堂煤矿的劣质煤，积压资金在二千三百余亿元以上。天津市百货公司执行市财政经济委员会指示，收购了大批没有销路的袜子，积压资金一百七十二亿元。各地国营贸易企业的经营管理不善和盲目调拨商品，不仅增大了商品的损耗，浪费了运费，也造成了商品的大量积压。中国百货公司事先不了解浙江省是否需要纸张，就盲目进行调拨，致使浙江省积压了价值四百四十七亿余元的纸张。中国菸麻公司在一九五二年四月份由华东调往天津出口火麻二千五百吨，其中一千吨不合规格，经过加工整理，除损失三百吨（折价三十一亿元）外，仍不能出口；又因不适合华北销售，还要运回华东。中国工业器材公司西南区公司不调查当地需要，在一九五一年向总公司盲目调进大批钢材，目前积压八千吨左右，约值八百亿至一千二百亿元。这批钢材前后积压时间已有一年以上。
    有些国营贸易企业由于仓库制度混乱，账货不符，保管不善而造成的商品积压、损失现象也很严重。黑龙江佳木斯百货批发站对仓库工作缺乏检查，财务会计账与保管账从未核对过，储运工作制度很不健全，分拨给各县的物资往往是所拨非所用，各地需要的又拨不到，以致该站积压的物资经常在二百车厢左右。东北区本溪市百货公司第二商店的仓库里，积压着四十多种商品。该公司批发部有半个多月没有东轮牌白素毛巾卖，市公司却把这种毛巾当成“冷背货”，在仓库里积压了一年。江苏南京市百货公司去年第三季度调进五千令打字纸，只销了二千令，但到第四季度又盲目调进了七千令，以致近万令纸张长期积压，不能销售。
    各地国营贸易企业的工作人员应深刻认识：商品积压给国家造成的损失是极严重的。大家应深入检查并彻底解决商品的积压问题，加强经营管理，贯彻经济核算制，切实为居民的需要服务，并努力节约和积累资金，以供国家大规模经济建设的需要。
