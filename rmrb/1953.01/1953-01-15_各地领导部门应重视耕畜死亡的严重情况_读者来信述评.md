Leading Departments in Various Regions Should Pay Attention to the Serious Situation of Draft Animal Deaths

Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that since the beginning of winter last year, due to the outbreak of animal diseases, sudden cold weather, and farmers' poor feeding management of livestock, the situation of draft animal deaths in various regions has been very serious. Leading departments in various regions should pay close attention to this and immediately take effective measures to protect livestock, so as not to hinder future agricultural and animal husbandry production.

In November and December of last year, draft cattle in Wuqiang, Zaoqiang, Hengshui, Ji, Wuqiang and other counties in Hebei Province, as well as Neihuang County in Henan Province, were suffering from emphysematous anthrax. According to incomplete statistics, the above-mentioned five counties in Hebei Province had 246 draft cattle die of illness in November last year; Li Village in the fourth district of Neihuang County originally had 15 cattle, and six of them died of illness in less than ten days. When the weather suddenly turned cold, farmers' poor feeding and warmth preservation of draft cattle was also a cause of death. From December 4th to 7th last year, 129 draft cattle were frozen to death in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province; the situation of draft cattle freezing to death was also very serious in Qixia, Penglai, Zhaoyuan, Laiyang and other counties in Shandong Province, and Feixi County in Anhui Province.

Readers also reflected that some agricultural production mutual aid organizations, especially farmers in mutual aid groups where livestock are jointly owned, often overuse public livestock and do not pay attention to feeding. Whoever's family the livestock are at, they want to "finish two days of work in one day." For example, Liu Shiqi, a farmer from Weijiagou, Longmen District, Laiyang County, had his mule worked to death in this way after it was jointly owned by the mutual aid group.

In addition, some branches of the People's Insurance Company of China in some areas failed to strictly adhere to the principle of "full valuation, 80% insurance" when carrying out livestock insurance work. The insured amount for old livestock is generally above 80%, or even close to 100%. Recently, the market price of livestock has generally fallen, and the insured amount often exceeds the market price, so some farmers have developed the mistaken idea of ​​relying solely on insurance and not paying attention to protecting livestock. Individual farmers even take the opportunity to harm insured livestock in an attempt to receive high compensation. This is another reason for the increase in livestock deaths. According to statistics from the Laiyang Central Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China, the number of livestock deaths in the area was 781 in August last year, increased to 874 in September, and further increased to 1,048 in October. This shows the seriousness of the problem.

It must be pointed out that in the process of the above-mentioned serious situation, the leading organs of some counties and districts did not conduct timely education on the protection of livestock for farmers; they also did not strictly implement effective prevention and control methods such as isolation and disinfection in areas where animal diseases had occurred, and individual areas even allowed the masses to dispose of dead livestock at will. For example, after the sick cattle of Guan Xiqing in Nanxia Village, Fifth District of Hengshui, Hebei Province, died, the district chief actually approved the slaughter and consumption; the militia captain of Nanliangzhai Village, Sixth District of Zaoqiang, even led the militia to steal and dig up the buried dead cattle at night with guns to skin and eat. This increases the possibility of the spread of animal diseases.

In order to ensure that the supply of livestock and livestock products can meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development and export, the work of protecting livestock cannot be ignored. Agricultural departments across the country should cooperate with local veterinarians, scientific workers, and propaganda staff to vigorously publicize common sense about preventing animal diseases to the masses of farmers, and educate farmers to improve feeding management and livestock hygiene. If diseased animals are found, strict blockade, isolation, disinfection, and carcass disposal should be implemented in a timely manner, and vaccinations should be widely administered in nearby areas. Only when the leadership pays attention and the masses are mobilized can the work of protecting livestock be greatly strengthened.

### 各地领导部门应重视耕畜死亡的严重情况——读者来信述评

    各地领导部门应重视耕畜死亡的严重情况
    ——读者来信述评
    近来我们收到许多读者来信，反映自去年入冬以来，由于发生畜疫、天气骤然转冷，以及农民对牲口饲养管理不善等原因，各地耕畜死亡的情况很严重。各地领导部门亟应引起重视，立即采取有效的办法保护牲畜，以免妨害今后的农牧业生产。
    去年十一、二月间，河北省武邑、枣强、衡水、冀县、武强等县，以及河南省的内黄县，耕牛都在流行着气肿疽病。据不完全统计，上述河北五个县在去年十一月份已病死耕牛二百四十六头；内黄县四区李庄村原有牛十五头，不到十天病死了六头。当天气突然转寒时，农民对耕牛饲养和保暖不良，也是产生死亡的一个原因。从去年十二月四日到七日，江苏省高邮县即冻死了耕牛一百二十九头；山东省栖霞、蓬莱、招远、莱阳等县及安徽省肥西县，冻死耕牛的情况也很严重。
    读者还反映，有些农业生产互助组织，特别是牲畜公有的互助组的农民，对于公有的牲口往往过度使用而不注意饲养。牲口临到谁家，谁都想“两天活一天干完”。如莱阳县龙门区韦家沟农民刘世启的骡子归互助组公有后，就是这样累死的。
    此外，有些地区的中国人民保险公司在开展牲畜保险工作时，未能严格掌握“十足评价，八成承保”的原则，老牲口保额一般在八成以上，甚至接近十足。近来牲口市价普遍下跌，保额多超过市价，因而有的农民就产生了单纯依靠保险而不注意爱护牲口的错误思想。个别农民甚至趁机残害保畜，企图领取高额赔款。这也是增加牲畜死亡的另一个原因。根据中国人民保险公司莱阳中心支公司的统计，该地区牲畜死亡数在去年八月份为七百八十一头，九月份增为八百七十四头，十月份则增至一千零四十八头。由此可见问题的严重。
    必须指出，在发生上述严重情况的过程中，有些县、区的领导机关并没有对农民及时进行有关保护牲畜的教育；对已发生畜疫的地区也没有严格实行隔离、消毒等有效的防治方法，个别地区甚至允许群众随意处理病死的牲畜。如河北衡水五区南夏村关喜庆的病牛死后，该区区长竟准予宰食；枣强六区南两寨村民兵中队长竟于晚间率领民兵持枪偷挖已埋掉的死牛剥食。这样就增加畜疫蔓延的可能性。
    为了使牲畜和畜产品的供应能适应工、农业生产的发展和外销的需要，保护牲畜的工作是不容忽视的。全国各地的农业部门应配合当地的兽医工作者、科学工作者和宣传工作人员，大力向农民群众宣传预防兽疫的常识，教育农民改善饲养管理和牲畜卫生工作。如果发现疫畜，要及时地、严格地实行封锁、隔离、消毒和毁尸，并要在附近地区普遍注射防疫针。只有领导重视了和群众发动起来了，护畜工作才能大大地加强。
