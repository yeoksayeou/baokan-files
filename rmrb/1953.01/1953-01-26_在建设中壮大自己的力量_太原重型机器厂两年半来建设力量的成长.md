    Strengthening Our Forces in Construction
    ——The Growth of Construction Capabilities at Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Over Two and a Half Years
    Chao Qi

    The entire workforce of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is greeting 1953 with full confidence in completing the factory construction task one year ahead of schedule. Over the past two and a half years, they have already built a number of factory buildings. Apart from the steel structure roof trusses for the medium forging workshop, cold working workshop, primary processing workshop, hardware warehouse, boiler room, and steel casting workshop, as well as some machine installation, ancillary equipment, dormitory and other projects that will be completed in the first half of next year, the workers are full of confidence in completing several major projects this year, including the metalworking workshop, iron casting workshop, wood model workshop, and tool and repair workshop.

    This confidence is built on the growth of their own strength. The past two and a half years have been a process of development for Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, from having no construction force to having one, and from small to large.

    Comrades who participated in the construction of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant from the beginning clearly remember the situation in July 1950: at that time, the Taiyuan Engineering Office, which was responsible for the construction of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, had only a dozen cadres; the design staff at the Shanghai office also numbered only a dozen. Many things needed to be done, but without cadres, nothing could be accomplished. Therefore, enriching the cadre ranks and uniting and educating technical personnel became the key to carrying out the work at that time, and the primary task in the factory's construction.

    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council designated the East China Industrial Department to assist them in solving the difficulty of lacking technical strength. By the end of 1950, the number of engineering and technical personnel transferred, borrowed, and recruited through the East China Industrial Department had reached seventy-five. This was the only technical force that could be relied upon during construction. They had already done a preliminary design in Shanghai; at this time, they had to be mobilized to Taiyuan, otherwise the technical design could not be carried out, and the technical problems in the construction would have no one to solve. However, this was a very arduous task. Comrade Yang Junjie, the head of the personnel section, was the one who did the mobilization work in Shanghai at that time. In order to complete this task, it took a full three months and a lot of twists and turns. Many people had agreed to come, and even bought train tickets, but suddenly said they would not come; many people bought train tickets three or four times, and finally got on the train with the attitude of "let's take a look and see."

    Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant also expanded its cadre strength through recruitment, borrowing, and allocation from higher authorities. The current total number of cadres has reached eight hundred and eighty-four, more than half of whom were recruited through labor agencies in Shanghai and Taiyuan.

    Simply increasing the number of cadres is not enough; it is necessary to improve the ideological and professional level of the cadres in order to truly overcome the contradiction between the large task and the small strength. For Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, it is especially important to improve the ideological and professional level of technical personnel. Although the errors in the plant's preliminary design have declared the complete bankruptcy of capitalist technical standards, there are still many difficulties in getting engineering and technical personnel to believe in the advancement of Soviet science and technology. If technical personnel do not believe in the advancement of Soviet science and technology, they cannot carry out technical design according to the opinions of Soviet expert Comrade Klimsky regarding the preliminary design. What should be done? The best way is to educate technical personnel with the lessons of failure and Klimsky's sincere help, and encourage them to study Soviet technology. Comrade Klimsky's opinions on the preliminary design left a deep impression on the technical personnel. They felt that they had studied in capitalist countries for a long time but still did not know how to design a factory, but after only one day of contact with Soviet experts, they initially understood the principles of factory design, and therefore felt secretly happy in their hearts. Two engineers once talked to me about the process of their ideological transformation. They said: When carrying out technical design, the leadership called on us to learn from the Soviet Union and insisted on adopting Soviet technical standards. However, each time, the technical personnel always first flipped through those familiar books and magazines published by capitalist countries with reluctance, but because they could not find complete and specific information, they disappointedly put them away, and then turned to those very unfamiliar Russian books with a skeptical and tentative attitude. Every time they flipped through Russian books, they gained something, and things that could not be found after searching through British and American materials could be found here. Engineer Zhuang Guoshen said to me: "After suffering the lessons of failure, I felt a sense of intimacy as soon as I came into contact with Soviet books. This feeling will encourage you to learn Russian and learn from the Soviet Union." It was in this way that the technical personnel believed in the call of the leadership through bits and pieces of facts, improved their ideological and professional level, and completed the technical design.

    Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant also adopted the method of cultivating and training in the work to improve the professional level of cadres. From the end of 1951 to the present, accounting and statistics training classes, labor and wage training classes, electrical training classes, and planning personnel training classes have been held successively, overcoming the difficulty of lacking various cadres. In addition, more than two hundred and fifty trainees have been trained in actual work, and some of them are already able to work independently. Those who have made rapid progress, such as intern Wang Yangming, who entered the factory in 1950, are already able to design overhead cranes. In the technical office, engineers and technicians also organized "teaching contracts" with draftsmen and interns to ensure that they would teach and learn technology within a certain period of time. In four months, most people have learned courses such as design estimation and projection.

    Now people have realized that it is necessary to rely on their own construction forces in order to ensure the quality and progress of the project. This is an experience gained at a great price.

    Before the "Three-Anti" campaign, because the importance of organizing their own construction forces was not recognized, the vast majority of projects were contracted to private merchants. Private merchants demanded a lot of money and also stole materials in large quantities, thereby reducing the quality of the project. As a result of the inspection in the "Three-Anti" campaign, it was found that private merchants stole materials worth 5.5 billion yuan. The "Three-Anti" campaign reversed the view of relying on contractors. The decision was made to organize their own construction forces, but at that time, the preparatory office only had a repair group with a total of no more than ninety people, and there was a fundamental lack of cold working workers for metal structures and civil construction workers in construction, no construction management institutions and experience, and no necessary construction equipment. Under the leadership of the Party and the administration, the decision was made to rely on the working class to strengthen their own construction forces, and to combine active training with organizational allocation to overcome the difficulty of weak construction forces.

    In terms of metal structures, the higher authorities transferred and borrowed one hundred and seventy-eight cold working technicians from brother factories in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and other places. This provided the backbone. At the same time, more than two hundred odd-job workers and more than one hundred apprentices who had just come from the countryside were assigned to the existing production teams, and teachers and apprentices were called upon to sign master-apprentice contracts to train them in actual work. In terms of civil construction, in addition to the strength of the original Taiyuan Engineering Office of the Central Heavy Industry Department, the preparatory office recruited more than one thousand six hundred workers and organized its own engineering team, which now has nine hundred skilled workers. As a result, in a short period of three months of actual operation, many odd-job workers and apprentices have mastered cold working technology, and some have even taken on apprentices. The newly born civil engineering team, due to the promotion of advanced experience and the implementation of the parallel flow operation method, completed the construction of the New Six Family Dormitory project thirty-one days ahead of schedule, saving more than 11,000 man-days and saving materials worth 540 million yuan, and the quality was completely up to standard, creating a model of "good, economical, and fast" in the construction industry in Taiyuan.

    The growth of the construction force is inseparable from the gradual strengthening of the plant's political work. Before the "Three-Anti" campaign, the political work of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant was very weak. When rushing to process the three major projects of the forging and cold working workshops in early 1951, the entire plant only had one Party branch, and the branch secretary was concurrently held by Comrade Yang Junjie, the head of the personnel section at the time. Comrade Yang Junjie held eight positions concurrently, and in fact did not have dedicated time to do Party work. The chairman of the trade union was also concurrently held by the head of the capital construction section, and there was only one secretary. With a weak organization and few cadres, the work of carrying out political education for workers from all directions was naturally done very poorly. The morale of the workers fluctuated. When Comrade Yang Junjie talked about the work at that time, he sighed repeatedly and said: "There are really too few people (referring to leading cadres)! Some people were fine during the day, but suddenly said they would quit at night. We rush to complete the project during the day and engage in ideological work at night." This situation did not end until the "Three-Anti" campaign. After the "Three-Anti" campaign, the administrative leadership was strengthened, the Party committee and the Communist Youth League committee were established, and the trade union organization was also improved. Since the second half of last year, the Party and trade union leaders have successively launched the campaigns to increase production and practice economy to find loopholes, the quality inspection campaign, the safety inspection campaign, the red flag competition campaign, and the winter rush work campaign. These movements have played a great role in improving the political and technical level of workers and in ensuring the progress and quality of the project. Through these movements, people have felt the strength of the Party in practice. A technician told me that when he saw the comrades of the Party committee discussing this year's plan, he felt that the complete realization of this plan was guaranteed.

    在建设中壮大自己的力量
    ——太原重型机器厂两年半来建设力量的成长
    超祺
    太原重型机器厂全体职工满怀着提前一年完成建厂任务的信心，迎接一九五三年。两年半来，他们已经建设起一批厂房。除了中锻工车间、冷作车间、初加工车间、五金库房、锅炉房和铸钢车间的钢结构屋架，以及一部分机器安装、附属设备、宿舍等工程要待明年上半年最后完工以外，职工们满怀信心地准备在今年完成金工车间、铸铁车间、木模车间、工具和修理车间等几项重大工程。
    这种信心是建立在自己力量的成长上的。过去的两年半时间，对太原重型机器厂来说，是建设力量从无到有，从小到大的发展过程。
    从开始就参加太原重型机器厂建厂工作的同志，都还清楚地记得一九五○年七月的情形：当时参加太原重型机器厂建厂工作的太原工程处只有十几个干部；上海事务所的设计人员也只有十几个。许多事情需要做，但没有干部什么事也做不成。因此，充实干部力量，团结和教育技术人员，就成为当时开展工作的关键，成为建厂工作中的首要任务。
    政务院财政经济委员会指定华东工业部协助他们解决缺乏技术力量的困难。到一九五○年年底，经华东工业部调用、借用和招聘的工程技术人员已达七十五人。这是建厂中唯一可依靠的技术力量。他们在上海已经做了一个初步设计；这时候必须把他们动员到太原来，否则技术设计就不能进行，施工中的技术问题就没有人解决。然而这却是一个十分艰巨的工作。人事处长杨俊杰同志就是当时在上海做动员工作的。为了完成这个任务，整整花了三个月时间，费了不少周折。不少人已同意来了，甚至火车票也买好了，突然间又说不来了；不少人买了三、四次火车票，最后还是抱着“看一看再说”的心情上火车的。
    太原重型机器厂还通过招聘、借调和上级分配的办法扩大了干部力量。现在的干部总数已达八百八十四人，其中有一半以上是通过上海、太原两地的劳动机关招聘来的。
    仅仅增加干部的数量是不成的，必须提高干部思想水平和业务水平，才能真正克服任务大、力量小的矛盾。对于太原重型机器厂来说，提高技术人员的思想水平和业务水平尤其重要。该厂的初步设计的错误，虽已宣布了资本主义的技术标准的彻底破产，但要工程技术人员相信苏联科学技术的先进还有不少困难。技术人员不相信苏联科学技术的先进，就不能根据苏联专家克林姆斯基同志关于初步设计的意见进行技术设计。怎样办呢？最好的办法，是以失败的教训和克林姆斯基的真诚的帮助来教育技术人员，鼓励他们学习苏联技术。克林姆斯基同志关于初步设计的意见，给技术人员留下了深刻的印象。他们感到过去在资本主义国家学习很长时间，还不懂得怎样设计一个工厂，与苏联专家接触不过一天，就初步懂得了工厂设计的原则，因而心里暗暗地高兴。曾经有两个工程师和我谈起他们思想转变的过程。他们说：在进行技术设计时，领导方面号召向苏联学习，坚持采用苏联的技术标准。技术人员每一次却总是先以依恋的心情翻着那些熟悉的资本主义国家出版的书籍和杂志，因为找不到一个完整而具体的资料，才失望地把它们收起来，然后以怀疑的试探的心情去翻那些十分生疏的俄文书籍。翻俄文书籍每一次都有收获，找遍英美资料得不到的东西在这里都可以找到。庄国绅工程师对我说：“饱尝了失败的教训以后，一接触苏联书籍就发生亲切的感情。这种感情会鼓舞你学习俄文，向苏联学习。”技术人员就是这样通过一点一滴的事实相信了领导方面的号召，提高了自己的思想和业务水平，完成了技术设计。
    太原重型机器厂还采取了在工作中培养和训练的办法提高干部的业务水平。从一九五一年年底到现在，曾先后举办了会计统计训练班、劳动工资训练班、电气训练班和计划人员训练班，克服了缺乏各种干部的困难。另外，在实际工作中培养了练习生二百五十余人，其中一部分人已能单独进行工作。进步快的如一九五○年进厂的实习员王阳明等，已能设计空中行车了。在技术室里，还组织工程师、技术人员与描图员、实习生订立“教学合同”，保证在一定时间内教会、学会技术。在四个月中，大部分人已学会设计估算和投影等课程。
    现在人们已经认识了，必须依靠自己的施工力量，才能保证工程的质量和进度。这是付了很大的代价才取得的一条经验。
    “三反”以前，由于没有认识到组织自己的施工力量的重要性，绝大部分工程是包给私商作。私商要钱很多，还大量偷工偷料，因而减低了工程质量。在“三反”中检查的结果，发现私商盗窃材料价值达五十五亿元。“三反”运动把依靠包商的观点扭转过来。决心组织自己的施工力量，但是当时的筹备处只有一个总共不过九十人的修缮组，根本缺乏施工中金属结构的冷作工人和土木建筑工人，没有施工管理机构和经验，也没有必要的施工设备。在党和行政领导下决心依靠工人阶级壮大自己的施工力量，以积极培养和依靠组织调配相结合的办法，克服施工力量薄弱的困难。
    在金属结构方面，上级从上海、北京、天津、太原等地的兄弟厂调来和借来一百七十八个冷作技术工人。这就有了骨干。同时把两百多个刚从农村出来的杂工和百余个学徒，分配到已有的各生产小组中去，号召老师傅和徒工订师徒合同，在实际工作中培养他们。在土木建筑方面，除了原来中央重工业部太原工程处的力量，筹备处又招收了一千六百余工人，组织了自己的工程队，现在已有技术工人九百名。结果在短短的三个月的实际操作中，许多杂工和徒工已能掌握冷作技术，有的还带了徒弟。刚刚诞生的土木工程队，由于推广了先进经验，实行了平行流水作业法，在承建新六家宿舍工程时，提前三十一天完成任务，节省人工一万一千余个，节省材料五亿四千万元，而且质量完全合乎标准，在太原市建筑业中，创造了“又好、又省、又快”的范例。
    建设力量的成长是与该厂政治工作的逐渐加强分不开的。“三反”运动以前太原重型机器厂的政治工作是十分薄弱的。一九五一年初突击加工、锻工和冷作车间三大工程时，全厂只有一个党支部，支部书记还是由当时的人事科科长杨俊杰同志兼任。杨俊杰同志身兼八职，实际上没有专门的时间做党的工作。工会主席也是由基本建设科科长兼任，另外只有一位秘书。组织弱，干部少，对从四面八方来的工人进行政治教育的工作自然作得很差。职工情绪忽高忽低。杨俊杰同志谈到那时的工作时连声叹气地说：“人（指领导干部）少得真可怜！有些人白天工作时还是好好的，晚上突然说不干了。我们白天赶工程，晚上又搞思想。”这种情况直到“三反”运动时才结束。“三反”运动以后，行政领导加强了，党委、团委成立了，工会组织也健全了。从去年下半年起，党和工会领导先后开展了增产节约找窍门运动、质量检查运动、安全检查运动、红旗竞赛运动，以及冬季抢工运动。这些运动，对于提高职工的政治与技术水平，对于保证工程的进度和质量都起了极大的作用。通过这些运动，人们在实践中已经感觉到党的力量。一位技术人员对我说，当他看到党委会的同志讨论今年的计划时，就感到这个计划的完满实现有了保证。
