At the Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
He Xiangning's Speech

　　The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is holding its Third Plenary Session today, and everyone is gathered here again in joy. Comrades of the KMT Revolutionary Committee have always respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen and admired Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Everyone respects Mr. Sun Yat-sen's indomitable spirit in leading the Xinhai Revolution, seeking freedom and equality for China, and the great revolutionary spirit of determining the Three Great Policies when reorganizing the Kuomintang. Unfortunately, he died young, and Chiang Kai-shek seized power, bringing disaster to the country and the people, causing half of our country to fall into enemy hands. Fortunately, with Chairman Mao's wise vision and correct leadership, he finally rescued China from the brink of collapse, allowing the people of the whole country to celebrate their survival. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government three years ago, my country's international status has been rising day by day, and great achievements have also been made in various constructions of culture, science, health, education, water conservancy, transportation, national defense, agriculture, and industry. These brilliant achievements under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao can be a comfort to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Since we admire Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we should also admire Chairman Mao in the same way. I hope that all comrades of the KMT Revolutionary Committee will work together to promote domestically and internationally that our comrades are united in supporting Chairman Mao. And be prepared at all times to abide by and respond to all of Chairman Mao's calls.
　　Mr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of allying with Russia had already begun to be decided in the second year after the success of the October Revolution. Today, the reason why our country's construction achievements in the past three years have been so great, and the speed of various production developments has been so amazing, is mostly due to the help of Soviet friends. Comparing the production development of capitalist countries and the countries in the democratic camp, the speed of industrial production in capitalist countries is far behind the speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. The rulers of capitalist countries only know how to seize huge profits, exploit the people domestically, and implement the militarization of the national economy. As a result, it can only cause more strikes and unemployment at home. At the same time, their enslavement and plunder of the blood and resources of the people in colonies and semi-colonies abroad will only prompt the oppressed nations to rise up in resistance. Today, only three short years after the founding of our country, under the encouragement of the victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, we have begun large-scale industrialization construction, starting with the development of heavy industry. After heavy industry is developed, agriculture, transportation, and various light industries can also be developed. These all need to rely on the sincere and selfless help of Soviet friends. From now on, if we want to promote China's prosperity and make the Chinese people have a bright and promising future, we must continue to cooperate with the Soviet Union in friendship. Mr. Sun Yat-sen always paid great attention to our country's production and construction. In order to carry out various constructions in our country, he also compiled "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction." Recently, difficult projects such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Tanggu New Port, Kangding-Tibet Highway, and Yellow River Iron Bridge have been completed with the help of Soviet experts. The people of the whole country are sincerely grateful. Comrades of the KMT Revolutionary Committee, especially should remember Mr. Sun Yat-sen's foresight in deciding to unite with the Soviet Union to save the country through production more than twenty years ago, and strive to consolidate Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, learn from the Soviet Union, emulate the Soviet Union's advanced production experience, and build a new democratic China!
　　I still remember clearly that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, on his deathbed, repeatedly called out "Peace, struggle, save China" several times. And he also said intermittently: "Danger! Enemies on all sides (referring to imperialism). I worry that some comrades will be softened by the enemy." Wang Jingwei at the time promised: "If we are afraid of danger, we will not revolt." Unexpectedly, after a few years, Wang Jingwei forgot these words completely and went back on his word. Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time, on his deathbed, still emphasized that we should be peaceful but also struggle against the enemies on all sides. It can be seen that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very brave. He never wanted to compromise and humiliate himself in front of the enemy. I remember that in 1924, he held on to a corner of Bai'etan in Guangzhou, confronting British imperialism, and was not intimidated by British imperialism. Now, the powerful new China that has just grown up is also facing the imperialist aggressive bloc. All of us Chinese people should work harder to struggle. The World People's Peace Congress was held in Vienna, and dozens of comrades, including Madam Sun Yat-sen, Vice Premier Guo, Mr. Chen Shutong, Cai Tingkai, Mao Dun, Liu Ningyi, and Zhang Bojun, went to attend, expressing the peace wishes of our people across the country. Recently, regarding the Korean peace talks, Foreign Minister Zhou has issued several solemn statements and proposed fair and reasonable armistice proposals. But they have all been obstructed by the US warmongering government. They have continued to violate the Geneva Convention, massacred prisoners of war, and continued to step up arms expansion, arming Japan (please recall the deep hatred of the Japanese disaster). Recently, they have even revealed their intention to expand the equipment of the South Korean puppet army, dreaming of dominating Asia and dominating the world. In order to defend our homes and defend our country, and to strive for lasting peace, we must continue to strengthen the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! Support the brave volunteers at the front! I hope that all comrades of the KMT Revolutionary Committee, since they respect Mr. Sun Yat-sen, should remember his words "Peace, struggle, save China," and exchange struggle for peace.

    在中国国民党革命委员会二届三中全会上
    何香凝的讲话
    中国国民党革命委员会今日召开三中全会，大家又欢聚一堂了。民革的同志，一向都是尊重孙先生与敬佩孙先生的。大家都尊敬孙先生当日百折不挠，领导辛亥革命，求中国之自由平等，及改组国民党时，确定三大政策的伟大革命精神。可惜他不幸早逝，被蒋介石把持政权，祸国殃民，使半壁河山，一度沦入敌手。幸而有毛主席的英明远见，正确领导，终于挽救了垂危的中国，使全国人民得庆绝处逢生。自从中央人民政府成立后三年来，我国国际地位已日益提高，文化、科学、卫生、教育、水利、交通、国防、农业、工业的各种建设，也获得了很大的成就，这些在毛主席的英明领导下获得的辉煌成绩，都可以告慰于孙先生的。我们敬佩孙先生，就更应同样的敬佩毛主席。我希望民革各位同志，共同努力在国内国外宣传，我们同志大家都是同心一德拥护毛主席的。并且时刻准备遵守和响应毛主席的一切号召。
    孙先生的联俄政策，早在十月革命成功后第二年，就已经开始决定了的。今天，我国三年来各项建设成就之所以如此伟大，和各项生产发展的速度之所以如此惊人，多半是由于得到苏联友人的帮助，才能这样。从资本主义国家和民主阵营各国生产发展情况的比较，就发展速度来说，资本主义国家的工业生产的速度，就远远落在苏联和人民民主国家工业发展速度的后面。资本主义国家的统治者，只知一味攫取巨大利润，在国内剥削人民，实行国民经济军事化。结果，只能引起国内更多的罢工和失业。同时，他们在国外奴役和掠夺殖民地半殖民地人民的血汗资源，亦只有促使被压迫民族起来反抗。我国在建国短短三年后的今天，就在抗美援朝战争胜利的鼓舞下，开始进行大规模的工业化建设，先从发展重工业开始，重工业发展了之后，农业、交通、运输及各种轻工业也可以跟着发展了。这些都更需要倚靠苏联友人真诚无私的帮助。此后我们要促进中国的富强，使中国人民有充满着无限光明的前途美景，一定要继续与苏联友好合作。孙先生对我国的生产建设，一向是十分注意的，他为了进行我国的各项建设，还编写了“建国方略”。最近，连成渝铁路、塘沽新港，康藏公路，黄河铁桥等艰巨工程，都在苏联专家的帮助下完成了。全国人民都衷心感激。民革同志、尤其要体念孙先生远在二十多年前决定联合苏联，生产救国的先知卓见，要努力巩固中苏友好合作，学习苏联，仿效苏联的先进生产经验，建设新民主主义的新中国！
    我还清楚记得，孙先生临终时，曾频呼“和平奋斗救中国”数次。并且还断断续续的说：“危险呀！四面都是敌人（就是指帝国主义）。我虑到有同志会被敌人软化。”汪逆精卫当时还答应说：“怕危险，就不革命了。”不料过了几年，汪逆就把这些话忘到九宵云外，自食其言。孙先生当时在弥留之际，还强调对待四面的敌人，应该要和平，但也要奋斗，可见孙先生是很勇敢的。他从来就不愿意在敌人面前屈辱妥协。记得他在一九二四年在广州坚守白鹅潭一隅之地，与英帝国主义对抗，就没有被英帝国主义所吓倒。现在刚成长起来的强大新中国，也正面对着帝国主义侵略集团的。我们全中国人民更应该努力奋斗。这次世界人民和平大会在维也纳召开，孙夫人、郭副总理、陈叔通老先生、蔡廷锴、茅盾、刘宁一、章伯钧等同志数十人，均前往出席，表达我全国人民的和平意愿。最近对朝鲜的和谈，周外长就发表了几次严正声明和提出公平合理的停战建议。但都遭到美国好战政府的阻挠。他们一直继续违反日内瓦公约，虐杀战俘，继续加紧扩充军备，武装日本，（日祸深仇、请大家回忆一下）最近更透露扩大装备南韩伪军，梦想支配亚洲支配世界。我们为了保家卫国，为了争取持久和平，就要继续加强抗美援朝！支持前方勇敢的志愿军！我希望民革的同志，大家都敬重孙先生，就要记住他“和平奋斗救中国”这句话，以奋斗来换取和平。
