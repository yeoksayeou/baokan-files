Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 3rd: According to Tass, the French Communist Party has issued a statement on the government crisis.

    The statement begins by pointing out that the forced resignation of the Pinay government is the result of the growing opposition of the French working class and people of all strata in urban and rural areas to its policies. Now, the bourgeois leaders want to establish a more reactionary government to achieve the goals that the Pinay government could not achieve. They plan to rely on emergency decrees and constitutional amendments to continue implementing policies based on the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At the same time, the United States is increasingly insistent that France step up its arms expansion and war preparations, establish military bases in France, arm West Germany, and continue the war in Vietnam and the Korean War.
    The statement continues: New financial and economic burdens (increased taxes, inflation, currency devaluation, factory closures) are hitting the working class, farmers, the middle class, women, and youth. The masses of the people are increasingly dissatisfied with the government, which in turn intensifies its fascist measures. This is a vicious cycle. If this phenomenon is to be avoided, there must be a comprehensive change in political direction. This change is necessary and possible.
    The statement emphasizes that in the near future, it is possible to establish a French government that pursues a policy of peace and national independence. This government should abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and all other aggressive war agreements, end the American occupation, strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question, end the war in Vietnam, restore our economy to a peaceful footing, and guarantee constitutional and personal freedoms.
    The French Communist Party puts forward the proposal to establish such a government, and it calls on all French men and women, regardless of age, party affiliation, religion, or region, to unite to discuss this proposal and to fight for the establishment of such a government. This government, relying on the working class and all important forces in the country, will certainly be stable. It can immediately implement the following: massive cuts in military and police appropriations to balance the budget; genuine tax reform to reduce the burden on small taxpayers and compensate with the huge profits of capitalists; reasonable price reductions, reduction of indirect taxes on essential commodities to promote economic prosperity; increased purchasing power of the working people to expand the domestic market; sound foreign trade, reconstruction of trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, and conclusion of economic agreements on an equal footing with Vietnam, Tunisia, Morocco, and other countries outside the dollar zone to expand foreign trade. Such a government can begin reconstruction work and meet the legitimate demands of the working people. This government should also do everything possible to promote the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, Democratic China, and France. Only by restoring its national independence can France once again play a major role, look forward to the future with confidence, and guarantee the people bread, freedom, and peace.

    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎三日讯：法国共产党就政府危机发表声明。
    声明首先指出：比内政府被迫辞职是法国工人阶级和城乡各阶层人民日益反对它的政策的结果。现在，资产阶级的领袖们想成立一个更加反动的政府，来达到比内政府所不能达到的目的。他们打算依靠用紧急法令和修改宪法的办法，来继续执行以马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约为基础的政策。同时，美国愈来愈坚持要法国加紧扩军备战，要在法国建立军事基地，武装西德，而且继续进行越南战争和朝鲜战争。
    声明继续说：新的财政与经济负担（赋税增加、通货膨胀、货币贬值、工厂倒闭）使工人阶级、农民、中产阶级、妇女和青年受到打击。人民群众对政府愈来愈不满，而政府就加紧采取法西斯措施。这是一种恶性循环。如果要避免这种现象，只有全面改变政治方针。这种改变是必要的，而且是可能的。
    声明着重说：在最近将来，成立一个执行和平与民族独立政策的法国政府是可能的。这个政府要摈弃北大西洋公约等一切侵略性战争协定，结束美国的占领；要努力促使和平解决德国问题，结束越南战争，使我们的经济恢复为和平经济，并且保障宪法自由和个人自由。
    法国共产党提出成立这样一个政府的建议，它要求全体法国男女，不分年龄、党派、宗教、地区，一致起来讨论这个建议，并且团结起来，为争取建立这样一个政府而斗争。这个政府依靠工人阶级和全国所有重要的力量，所以它一定可以稳定。它可以立即实现下列各点：大规模削减用于军事与警察的拨款以平衡预算；实行真正的税收改革，减轻小纳税人的负担而取偿于资本家的巨额利润；合理减低物价，减低主要必需品的间接税以促使经济繁荣；提高劳动人民购买力以扩大国内市场；健全对外贸易，重建与苏联、中国及人民民主国家的贸易关系，在平等的基础上和越南、突尼斯、摩洛哥及其他不属于美元区的国家缔结经济协定以扩大对外贸易。这样的政府可以着手复兴工作，并且满足劳动人民的合法要求。这个政府还要尽一切力量来促使美国、苏联、英国、民主中国和法国五大国缔结和平公约。法国只有恢复了民族独立，才能再度起大国的作用，才能满怀信心地展望前途，保证人民获得面包、自由与和平。
