To the Editor: I am a construction worker at a construction site near Chedaogou Village in the Haidian District of Beijing. Our construction site is ten miles away from Xizhimen, on the bus route from Beijing to Mentougou; apart from the public bus, there is no other public transportation. Every time we go to the city, we have to take the uptown bus on this route, but there is no bus stop nearby, and we have to run a long way to get on the bus. Because there are very few buses, we have to wait a long time each time. Since the construction started here last year, there have been several thousand workers from various construction units and other people stationed here. Everyone finds it very inconvenient to have to run a long way to catch the bus and to have to wait for the bus.

Public utilities should serve basic construction. I hope that the Beijing Public Bus Company will adjust the bus routes, schedules, and stations as the basic construction develops.

    北京市公共汽车公司应该为市郊工地工人解决交通问题
    编辑同志：我是北京市海甸区车道沟村附近某工地的一个建筑工人。我们工地离西直门有十里地，正在北京通往门头沟的汽车路上；除公共汽车外，没有其他公共交通工具。我们每次进城都得搭这条路上的上行汽车，但附近没有车站，上车还得跑出好远，因为车次非常少，每次都得等很久。这个地方从去年开始建设以来，各建筑单位的工人和驻在当地的其他人员总共有好几千人，大家对搭车要跑远路和等车都感到很不方便。
    公用事业应该为基本建设服务。我希望北京市公共汽车公司随着基本建设的发展情况，调整汽车行驶的路线、班次和车站。
