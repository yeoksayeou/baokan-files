Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor: On November 5, 1952, the "Reader's Letters Page" published a criticism from readers Feng Jiuling and Feng Jiulu, who pointed out that our company had not improved its actual work after accepting criticism from the newspaper. We believe this criticism is correct. The Tangshan Municipal Party Committee has already put forward suggestions on how to improve our work in the future, and we agree to implement them. We are now sending you our self-criticism.

    Since accepting the newspaper's criticism, although we have made some improvements in our work, there are still shortcomings and mistakes. For example, regarding the problem of stockpiled rock debris, workers raised opinions several times, but we always felt that there was no site for storage and we couldn't find a sales outlet, so we were at a loss and kept delaying it. By August, when there was really no other way, we estimated the accumulated debris and paid 70% of the wages. However, we still haven't come up with an active, fundamental solution since then. Regarding the lack of on-site storage, we did not create a plan in advance and submit it to the higher authorities for approval, so now not only is there no place to store the rock debris, but there is also no place to store the stone materials, which seriously affects production and workers' income. This shows that we are blind in production management and lack planning and foresight. Another example is the issue of receiving stones. After the newspaper criticized it, we did not conduct in-depth supervision and inspection, nor did we educate the receivers, so the problem was not corrected. This shows that our bureaucratic style is still serious.

    We are determined to improve our work, correct our mistakes, and run a people's enterprise well under the guidance and help of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the higher leading organs.

### 唐山市石头公司来信决心改进工作办好人民企业

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    唐山市石头公司来信决心改进工作办好人民企业
    编辑同志：一九五二年十一月五日，“读者来信专页”发表了读者冯九龄、冯九禄同志对我公司接受报纸批评后却未改进实际工作的情况提出批评，我们认为这个批评是正确的。关于今后改进工作的办法，唐山市委已经提出意见，我们同意执行。现将我们的检讨寄上。
    从接受报纸批评后，我们在工作上虽然有了一些改进，但是缺点和错误还是有的。如积压毛碴问题，工人几次提出意见，我们总认为没有现场可堆存，又找不到销路，只是束手无策，一直拖延下来。到八月份，实在没办法了，我们才把积存的毛碴估了一下，按百分之七十开了工资。但是，以后还是没有想出积极的、根本的解决办法。而对于现场缺乏的问题，我们事前没有造计划报请上级批核，所以到现在不光毛碴无处存放，就是石料也没地方存，以致严重地影响生产和工人收入。这说明我们在生产管理上是盲目的，缺乏计划性和预见性。又如收量石头问题，经报纸提出批评后，我们并没有深入督促检查和对收量人员进行教育，以致问题没得到纠正。这说明我们的官僚主义作风还是严重的。
    我们坚决在中共唐山市委会及上级领导机关的指导和帮助下，改进工作，纠正错误，办好人民的企业。
    唐山市石头公司
