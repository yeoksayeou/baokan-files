Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd dispatch: As the movement to restore trade with China grows daily among the Japanese public and the Japanese economic crisis deepens, nearly 300 Diet members from various Japanese parties have formed the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade," advocating the development of trade between Japan and China.

The "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade" was initially initiated by 34 Diet members including Kazuo Nakai (Liberal Party), Koichi Uda, Tokutaro Kitamura (both Progressive Party), Keiji Hoashi (Left-wing Socialist Party), Tomi Kora (Ryokufukai), and Akira Kazami (Independent). They issued an "Opinion Statement for Establishment" on December 1, 1952, which immediately gained a wide response among Diet members. Within just ten days, 292 members (204 members of the House of Representatives and 88 members of the House of Councillors) joined the "League," accounting for 41 percent of the total number of Diet members. These nearly 300 members broadly represent various parties, with the ruling Liberal Party having a total of 70 members, second only to the Left-wing Socialist Party's 87 members. In addition, there are 40 Progressive Party members and 54 Right-wing Socialist Party members.

On December 12, 1952, the official inaugural meeting of the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade" was held in Tokyo, attended by 50 representatives of Diet members from various parties. The meeting adopted the "League's" charter and unanimously resolved that, in order to promote Japan-China trade, it is necessary to formulate the necessary legal systems and conduct publicity and explanations in various regions.

The enthusiastic speeches of the Diet members at the meeting reflected the urgent demands of the Japanese economic circles for developing trade with China. Takechiyo Matsuda, a Liberal Party member elected from Osaka, said: Recently, various industries in Osaka have been in decline, and the only way out of this situation is to promote Japan-China trade.

At the same time, the mass organization "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference" also convened its fourth national conference in Tokyo on December 15th and 16th, 1952. In addition to the representatives of the "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference" from various local organizations throughout the country, there were also about 300 representatives from many Japanese companies, industrial and commercial groups, and organizations such as the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade." The meeting decided to cooperate with the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade" to jointly promote Japan-China trade. The meeting also decided to issue a declaration to strive for the implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

    日本民间要求恢复中日贸易运动日益开展
    各党派议员近三百名组成“日中贸易促进议员联盟”
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：随着要求恢复与中国进行贸易的运动在日本民间日益开展和日本经济危机的加深，将近三百名日本各党各派的国会议员组成了“日中贸易促进议员联盟”，主张发展日本与中国之间的贸易。
    “日中贸易促进议员联盟”最初是由中井一夫（自由党）、宇田耕一、北村德太郎（以上改进党）、帆足计（左派社会党）、高良富（绿风会）风见章（无党派）等三十四名国会议员发起设立的。他们在一九五二年十二月一日发表了一篇“设立意见书”，立即在国会议员之间获得了广泛的反应。仅在十天之内，就有二百九十二名议员（二百零四名众议员和八十八名参议员）参加了“联盟”，占国会议员总数的百分之四十一。这将近三百名议员，广泛地代表各党各派，其中执政的自由党议员共计七十人，仅次于左派社会党的八十七人。此外还有改进党议员四十人，右派社会党议员五十四人。
    一九五二年十二月十二日，“日中贸易促进议员联盟”正式成立大会在东京举行，参加大会的有各党派议员代表五十人。大会通过了“联盟”的章程，并一致决议：为促进日中贸易，必须制订必要的法律制度，同时向各地进行宣传解说。
    议员们在会上的踊跃发言，反映出日本经济界对于开展与中国的贸易的迫切要求。在大阪选出的自由党议员松田竹千代说：最近大阪百业不振，这种情况的出路除了推动日中贸易以外，别无他法。
    与此同时，群众性的团体“日中贸易促进会议”也在一九五二年十二月十五、十六两天在东京召开了第四次全国会议。出席这个会议的，除“日中贸易促进会议”全国各地方组织的代表以外，还有许多日本公司、工商业团体和“日中贸易促进议员联盟”等组织的代表共约三百人。会议决定与“日中贸易促进议员联盟”合作，共同促进日中贸易。会议并决定发表为履行中日贸易协议而努力的宣言。
