(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 26) Encouraged by the great victories of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, the people's guerrillas in South Korea have become more active. In vast areas from the vicinity of Seoul to the Chiri Mountain area in the southernmost part of Korea, and even Jeju Island, the guerrillas are constantly attacking the transportation lines of the American-Syngman Rhee gangs, raiding enemy strongholds, and constantly achieving brilliant victories.

According to a report in the "Democratic Korea" newspaper on some of the guerrillas' activities: People's guerrillas active in the areas of Pocheon and Gapyeong in Gyeonggi Province and Chuncheon in Gangwon Province, near the front lines, advanced to Byeokje-myeon, Goyang County, about 24 kilometers northwest of Seoul, on December 1 last year, and launched a surprise attack on a group of U.S. Navy personnel. The enemy was caught off guard, and many were killed or wounded.

People's guerrillas active in the Taebaek Mountains of South Gangwon Province are constantly attacking the enemy's transportation artery from Daegu to the front lines. On New Year's Eve, the people's guerrillas in Eungbong Mountain, northwest of Uljin County, ambushed five U.S. military trucks on an important enemy transportation line in the Uljin area, completely annihilating dozens of U.S. soldiers on board, and seizing a large number of weapons, clothing, and grain.

The people's guerrillas in the Songni Mountain area of the Sobaek Mountains in North Gyeongsang Province have also continuously broken through the enemy's so-called "watertight" cordon. On November 3, they once rushed into the important enemy stronghold, Chungju City, in North Chungcheong Province. On December 22, they raided the puppet army strongholds in Soi-myeon, Eumseong County, and Jeungpyeong on the railway line, killing and wounding a large number of enemies.

The famous Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit, which heroically persists in fighting in the Jirisan area of South Gyeongsang Province, has grown into a joint force with strong power in the course of its tenacious struggle. Around New Year's Eve, they carried out dozens of ambushes and attacks in succession. A certain group of people's guerrillas, known as the "Assault Team" and the "Victory Detachment," created particularly brilliant victories. On December 13, with the close support of the local people, they broke through the enemy's cordon and advanced to Daeye-ri, Namha-myeon, Geochang County. On the enemy's transportation line from Daegu to Geochang, they ambushed and seized a transport truck of the Syngman Rhee puppet army's 227th unit. Then, they blockaded a section of the transportation line near Gandong-ri, Bongsan-myeon, Hapcheon County (transliteration), attacked a convoy of the puppet army's 90th Military Police, wiped out the enemy military police on board, burned two enemy trucks, and seized a large number of munitions and materials that the American-Syngman Rhee gangs were transporting to the "Suppression Forces." Then, the members of the "Victory Detachment" advanced to the puppet police branch in Bongsan-myeon, annihilated the sleeping enemies at night, and, amid the cheers of the people, purged the local traitors and bullies, and then returned to their base.

On Jeju Island, the southernmost part of Korea, the Jeju Island People's Guerrillas, with a glorious tradition of struggle, have continuously crushed the enemy's "suppression" operations throughout the past year, attacking U.S. airfields, enemy assembly points, communication networks, highways, and important enemy military bases and cities (such as Jeju area, Seogwipo, and Moseulpo).

People's guerrillas in other parts of South Korea are also using heroic and resourceful operations to cooperate with the great victories won by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies on the front lines. The People's Guerrillas are receiving increasing love and support from the broad masses of the South Korean people.

    朝鲜南部人民游击队不断打击美李匪帮
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】南朝鲜各地人民游击队在朝中人民军队巨大胜利的鼓舞下已更加活跃，在从汉城附近直到朝鲜最南部的智异山地区以至济州岛的广大地区内，游击队不断袭击美李匪帮的运输线，奇袭敌军据点，不断取得光辉战果。
    据“民主朝鲜”报报道游击队的一部分活动情况说：活跃在接近前线的京畿道抱川、加平和江原道春川一带的人民游击队，在去年十二月一日曾挺进到汉城西北约二十四公里的高阳郡碧蹄面，奇袭一批美国海军。敌人措手不及，很多人被杀伤。
    活跃在南江原道太白山脉的人民游击队，不断袭击敌人从大邱到前线的运输动脉。蔚珍郡西北鹰峰山的人民游击队，新年前夕在蔚珍地区敌人的一条重要运输线上，伏击了五辆美军卡车，全部消灭了车上的数十名美军，缴获了大批武器、衣物和粮食。
    在庆尚北道小白山脉俗离山地区的人民游击队，也连续突破敌人吹嘘的所谓“滴水不漏”的警戒网。十一月三日，他们曾一度冲入敌人的重要据点、忠清北道的忠州城。十二月二十二日，他们又奇袭阴城郡、苏伊面和铁道线上的曾坪的伪军据点，杀伤了大批敌人。
    在庆尚南道智异山地区英雄地坚持战斗的著名的李铉相人民游击队，在顽强的斗争中已经成长壮大为一支有雄厚力量的联合部队。新年前夕，他们曾接连进行了几十次的埋伏战和袭击战。以“进击队”和“胜利大队”闻名的人民游击队某小组创造了特别光辉的胜利。十二月十三日，他们在当地人民的密切支援下，突破敌人的警戒网，挺进到居昌郡南下面大也里，在大邱到居昌的敌军运输线上，伏击并缴获了李承晚伪军二二七部队的一辆运输卡车。接着，他们又封锁了陕川郡凤山面间谷里（译音）附近的一段运输线，袭击伪军第九十宪兵队的运输车队，消灭了车上的敌宪兵，烧毁了敌卡车两辆，缴获了美李匪帮运给“讨伐队”的大批军火和物资。接着，“胜利大队”的队员们又向凤山面的伪警察支署进击，在夜间消灭了睡熟的敌人，并在人民的欢呼中肃清了当地的卖国贼和恶霸分子，然后返回根据地。
    在朝鲜最南端的济州岛，有光荣斗争传统的济州岛人民游击队在去年一年中曾不断地粉碎了敌人的“讨伐”，袭击了美军的飞机场、敌军的集结处、通信网、公路和敌人的重要军事基地和城市（如济州地区、西归浦和摹瑟浦等）。
    南朝鲜其他地区的人民游击队也以英勇机智的作战，来配合朝中人民军队在前线获得的伟大胜利。人民游击队正受到南朝鲜广大人民越来越大的爱戴和支持。
