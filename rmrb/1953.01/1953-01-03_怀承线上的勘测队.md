    Survey Team on the Huai-Cheng Railway Line
    Liu Hanwen

    The Huai-Cheng Railway Line runs from Huairou, Hebei, across the Baihe, Chaohe, and Luanhe Rivers, through the Great Wall, and over the Lahai Ridge, directly to Chengde, the capital of Rehe Province. On this line, rain or shine, the two detachments of the Fifth Survey Brigade of the Ministry of Railways, comprising 150 people, are often seen measuring the route with ranging poles, bamboo rulers, large rulers, and instruments.

    This work is not easy. The central line group encountered two major obstacles during their work: one was the Baihe River Bridge, which is 500 meters long in total, with a water surface of more than 200 meters. It was during the rainy season, and the river water was high. According to previous practice, when surveying rivers, triangulation was used instead of entering the water. However, using triangulation for the Baihe River Bridge would take at least half a day. After discussing it, measuring workers Zhang Zhiyong and Jiang Guisong felt that this method was too time-consuming and proposed using the rectangular method, with the bamboo ruler stretched across the river surface. This reasonable suggestion was approved by all members of the group. Therefore, they unhesitatingly waded into the river with the bamboo ruler, and as a result, they completed the measurement of the more than 200-meter water surface in just two hours. The other obstacle was at the first tunnel entrance of Qing Shui Wan. Immediately outside the tunnel entrance was a row of cliffs about forty to fifty meters high. It was raining, and the cliffs were slippery. It was very difficult to stretch the bamboo ruler across here. At that time, measuring workers Zhang Zhiyong, Liu Qihui, and Deng Zhizhong stepped forward and volunteered to climb the cliffs, grabbing thorns and stepping on rocks, to pull the 50-meter bamboo ruler across the middle of the cliffs. They continued to advance smoothly.

    Leaving Gubeikou and entering the mountainous area, especially the realignment from Zhangjiagoumen to Qingshuiwan and from Lahaigou to Luanping County, the terrain became extremely complex, and the work of the terrain group became increasingly difficult. Sometimes the measuring workers would run into deep gullies, and the target would be blocked by high mountains, making it impossible to see the ranging pole through the instrument. This wasted time, and the work efficiency was very low, with only two kilometers being done per day. Comrade Huang Shikui, a technician, researched a new method: in areas with complex terrain, he would first draw a sketch and tell the measuring workers how to run the points. In this way, they overcame the previous difficulty of not being able to see the people, and work efficiency gradually improved.

    The tasks assigned by the Ministry of Railways were: preliminary survey of 145 kilometers to be completed in 71 days; detailed survey of 105 kilometers to be completed in 46 days. Thanks to everyone's active participation and creativity in their work, the tasks were completed ahead of schedule. The preliminary survey was completed in 66 days, with an additional 44 kilometers surveyed, and the detailed survey was completed in 26 days, with an additional 10 kilometers surveyed.

    怀承线上的勘测队
    刘汉文
    怀承线，自河北怀柔，渡过白河、潮河、滦河，穿过万里长城，越过拉海岭，直达热河省会承德。在这条线上，不论是天晴下雨，经常有铁道部勘测五总队的两个分队，一百五十人拿着花杆、竹尺、大尺、仪器等，在测量路线。
    这个工作并不是轻而易举的，中线组在工作中曾经过两次大阻碍：一次是渡白河大桥，全桥长五百公尺，流水面二百多公尺，正是雨季时候，河水高涨。测量中遇到有河的地方，按以前惯例，都用三角测量方法，不用下水。但渡白河大桥用三角测量方法，至少要半天功夫，才能拉过去。拉竹尺测工张志永、蒋桂松两人合计一下，感到这种方法耽误时间太长，研究用矩形方法测，竹尺由河面上拉过去，这个合理化建议得到全组同志同意。于是他们毫不犹豫的，拉着竹尺涉水过河，结果，只用两小时的时间，拉完了二百多公尺的流水面。又一次是在清水湾第一隧道口，一出隧道口，就是一排高约四五十公尺的悬岩，正下着雨，悬岩溜滑，竹尺从这里拉过去，很不容易。当时测工张志永、刘启辉、邓致中都挺身而出，报名爬上悬岩，手抓着荆棘，脚踩着岩石，把五十公尺的竹尺从悬岩腰里拉过去，他们顺利地继续前进。
    自古北口出关，渐渐地进入山岳地区，尤其是张家沟门至清水湾和拉海沟至滦平县改线，地形至为复杂，地形组的工作越来越艰难。有时测工跑到了深沟里，目标被高山挡住，看仪器看不见跑尺。耽误时间，工作效率很低，一天只能做两公里。技术员黄士奎同志，就研究一个新的方法：在地形复杂的地区，自己先画一个草图，告诉测工同志怎样跑点。这样，克服以前看不见人的困难，工作效率逐步地提高了。
    铁道部交来的任务是：初测一百四十五公里，七十一天里完成；定测一百零五公里，四十六天完成。由于大家在工作中发挥了积极性和创造性，提前完成了任务。初测在六十六天内完成了，并加测了四十四公里，定测在二十六天内完成了，并加测了十公里。
