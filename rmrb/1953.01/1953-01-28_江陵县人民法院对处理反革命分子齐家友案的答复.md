    Jiangling County People's Court's Reply Regarding the Case of Counter-Revolutionary Element Qi Jiayou
    To the Editor: After reading the opinion published in the People's Daily on October 21st of last year, "Suggestion to Jiangling County People's Court to Investigate the Case of Counter-Revolutionary Criminal Qi Jiayou," we have conducted an investigation. After Qi was denounced by the masses, our court arrested and prosecuted Qi on May 16th of last year. At that time, our court cadre Deng Ziying (who has now been transferred) interrogated him and sentenced Qi to death. The case was then sent to the Jingzhou Branch of the Hubei Provincial People's Court for review, and the sentence was changed to life imprisonment. Due to a dragging style of work, we did not immediately write the judgment and shelved the case. It was not until Comrade Ye Cao, a reader, raised the issue that our court contacted the Jingzhou Branch again. After research by the Jingzhou Branch, it was still decided to sentence Qi to life imprisonment. In addition, Comrade Ye Cao said: "The judge Deng Ziying deleted some important criminal facts of the criminal from the report written to the higher authorities..." After our investigation, there was no such situation.　Hubei Province Jiangling County People's Court

    江陵县人民法院对处理反革命分子齐家友案的答复
    编辑同志：读了人民日报去年十月二十一日刊载的“建议江陵县人民法院检查反革命犯齐家友案”的意见后，我们已经作了检查。齐犯经群众检举后，我院已于去年五月十六日把齐犯逮捕法办。当时由我院干部邓子英（现已调走）审讯，判决齐犯死刑。继送湖北省人民法院荆州分院审核，改判齐无期徒刑。由于拖拉作风，我们没有立即写判决书，并且把该案搁置下来。直到读者野草同志提出，我院又才和荆州分院联系。现经荆州分院研究，仍决定判处齐犯无期徒刑。另外，野草同志说：“审判员邓子英把该犯的一些重要犯罪情况从给上级写的报告书中删去了……”经我们了解，没有那样的情况。　湖北省江陵县人民法院
