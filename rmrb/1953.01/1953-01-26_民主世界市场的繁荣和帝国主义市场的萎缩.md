    The most important economic consequence of the Second World War and its economic impact must be considered the disintegration of the unified, all-encompassing world market. This situation determines the further deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system."
              —Stalin, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR"

    The post-World War II world has fundamentally changed. The balance of power between the socialist system and the capitalist system has shifted dramatically in favor of socialism. In the political sphere, the post-war period has seen the formation of two opposing camps: the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism is growing stronger, while the camp of imperialism is weakening day by day. "The economic result of the existence of these two opposing camps is that the unified, all-encompassing world market has disintegrated, and consequently there are now two parallel and mutually opposed world markets." (Stalin, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR")

    The emergence of these two parallel world markets profoundly exposes the parasitic and decadent nature of the world capitalist economy. It is a concentrated manifestation of the further exacerbation of the general crisis of capitalism. On the other hand, it specifically reflects that the post-war Soviet Union is no longer an isolated island surrounded by capitalist countries; several countries in Central and Southeastern Europe have broken away from the capitalist system, and the Chinese people have shaken off imperialist oppression and gained liberation, leading to an unprecedented strengthening of the socialist camp. Therefore, the disintegration of the unified world market is the most important economic consequence of the Second World War and its economic impact.

    In the current international situation, the basic composition of these two markets is very clear. The market of the countries of the peace and democracy camp, or the democratic world market, includes the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic countries of Southeast Europe (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania), the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and others. The market of the imperialist aggression camp, or the capitalist world market, includes North America, Central and South America, Western Europe, the Near East, the Middle East, some countries in the Far East (excluding China), and some economically backward colonies and vassal states. These two opposing markets are developing in opposite directions: the new democratic world market is moving towards prosperity, going uphill; while the old capitalist world market is shrinking, going downhill.

    Why are the two markets developing in completely opposite directions? Essentially, it is because they are built on fundamentally different economic foundations. In the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the continuous upsurge of the peace economy and the planned development of the national economy are aimed at ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the entire society. Their continuous growth in production will never be accompanied by economic crises. Therefore, the democratic world market will never feel difficulties in sales, and its capacity increases year by year. However, the development of modern capitalist economy is "to ensure maximum capitalist profits by exploiting the majority of its own residents and bankrupting and impoverishing them, by enslaving and continuously plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by using wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring the highest profits." (Stalin) The frantic plunder by modern monopoly capital groups intensifies the basic contradiction within capitalist society (i.e., the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private form of ownership) to the point of volcanic eruption: the relative and absolute impoverishment of the broad masses of working people is deepening, the number of regularly unemployed is increasing, and the trend of a sharp decline in social purchasing power is accelerating. The storm of economic crisis is becoming increasingly dangerous, which inevitably makes the market problem of every capitalist country more and more serious.

    Because the economic development of the two worlds is influenced and regulated by different fundamental economic laws, the trade relations between countries within the two worlds also exhibit essential differences. The democratic world market is based on the fraternal relations and common interests of the countries of the democratic camp, "The basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic upsurge." (Stalin) Therefore, the trade relations between the countries of the democratic camp are equal, mutually beneficial, friendly, and mutually supportive. The comprehensive development of this economic cooperative relationship will inevitably lead to universal prosperity. Today, not only have a network of trade agreements been signed between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, but also long-term economic agreements have been concluded, bringing the economic cooperation between the countries into a new stage. Because the countries of the democratic camp possess abundant resources, each country can not only find the materials necessary for the development of its own economy, but also provide extremely favorable material conditions for the long-term planned development of the national economy.

    However, in the imperialist market, the economic relations between countries are manifested as relations of enslavement and being enslaved, exploitation and being exploited. There is, of course, no economic equality and cooperation here; all there is unequal exchange, tariff barriers, and market scramble. Comrade Stalin pointed out long ago that the "environment of the world economic development of capitalism is the desperate struggle of various imperialist groups for markets, raw materials, and the expansion of old spheres of influence." ("Conclusion to the Report on Social Democratic Tendencies in Our Party") After World War II, due to the US imperialists' pursuit of their expansionist policy and their attempt to gain world hegemony, the state of rupture of the capitalist world market has become even worse. The contradictions between the US and Britain are intensifying due to the struggle for oil, rubber, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, sulfur, and wool production areas, and sales markets for surplus products. The US used Britain's post-war economic difficulties to strengthen its political and economic control over Britain through loans, the "Marshall Plan," and various international conferences: destroyed the Imperial Preference System (reducing or abolishing the preferential tax rates for most commodities within the British Commonwealth), weakened the position of the pound sterling (forcing the devaluation of the pound by 30 percent in 1949), plundered the traditional markets for British industrial products (in Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, and South Africa), and seized a large number of strategic materials from the British Empire's colonies (especially rubber, tin, lead, manganese, wool, mica, ramie, etc.). The British monopoly capital groups are not reconciled to the US plunder and have taken various steps to resist fiercely. One of the main purposes of the recent (November 27th) Commonwealth Economic Conference held in London was to strengthen the financial and commercial ties between the countries of the pound sterling area in order to counter the intentions of American expansionism. In addition, the US plunder of Western Europe, Central and South America, and the Middle East and Near East has been intensified. From the "Marshall Plan" to the "Truman Point Four Program," from the "International Monetary Fund" to the "European Monetary Fund," from the "European Payments Union" to the "Atlantic Payments Union," the names may be different, but in essence, they are all to strengthen the dollar system, break other countries' trade quotas and tariff barriers, and find outlets for the US surplus commodities and surplus capital. Today's Western Europe has actually become the "unified market" of the US. Under the unequal exchange and the dumping of American goods, not only are the industries and agriculture of many backward countries on the verge of bankruptcy, but the abnormal and unstable nature of the international division of labor in capitalist countries has been further deepened. The export prices of US metal products, machinery and equipment, chemicals, transportation equipment, etc., are on average one-third higher than the highest market prices in the country. It is even more expensive for Central and South American countries to purchase old machines from the United States than the market price of new machines in the United States. In 1929, the market price of a "Ford" car was equivalent to the price of twenty bags of Brazilian coffee; by 1951, it took two hundred bags of Brazilian coffee to exchange for an American car. This is a typical example of unequal exchange, which fully demonstrates the parasitic and decadent nature of US foreign trade. In addition, the oil industry in Venezuela, the copper mines in Chile, the tin mines in Bolivia, the tobacco industry in Cuba, the cotton planting industry in Egypt, the cotton weaving industry in Turkey, the date palm gardens in Iraq, and the rubber industry in Southeast Asia are all going bankrupt under the squeeze, destruction, and engulfment of US monopoly capital.

    If we analyze the composition of commodities, we can make a clear comparison of the trade situation in the two world markets. On the side of the democratic world market, the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries develop foreign trade mainly to accelerate economic construction, expand economic cooperation between countries, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the entire population. In order to help the People's Democratic countries complete industrialization and socialist construction as soon as possible, the machinery and other technical equipment that the Soviet Union ships to various countries are the most modern and cheapest. The quantity exported this year is equivalent to ten times that of 1948. The trade agreements that have been signed between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries also stipulate the supply of complete sets of equipment and machinery needed for factories (such as machine manufacturing factories, automobile tractor factories, etc.), power plants, mines, and oil wells. In this way, a solid foundation has been laid for the long-term planned development of the national economies of various countries.

    From the commodities exchanged by the People's Democratic countries, they have fully achieved mutual benefit and have what they need. Poland's main exports are coal, zinc, iron, steel, various machines, and agricultural products; Czechoslovakia exports steel, hardware, machines, glass, paper, shoes, medicines, textiles, and sugar; Hungary exports various transportation machinery industry products, electrical materials, textiles, and many agricultural products; Romania's exports are dominated by timber, petroleum, light industrial products, etc., Bulgaria exports cement, minerals, tobacco, and many industrial raw materials, and Albania exports petroleum, asphalt, and agricultural products. The industrial products exported by the German Democratic Republic and the many kinds of mineral products and industrial raw materials exported by our country account for a large proportion. With the rapid development of the industry in the People's Democratic countries, the proportion of the export of various means of production is increasing day by day.

    As for the situation in the imperialist market, it is completely different. The militarization of the economies of the imperialist countries has not only deepened the contradictions between them, but also disrupted the trade system of the capitalist world. The important characteristic of the industrial production of the major capitalist countries at present is the continuous increase in military orders and the increasing decline of civilian industries, which is particularly prominent in the composition of commodities in their foreign trade last year. In the capitalist world market, the trade of military products, strategic materials, and other military industrial products has occupied an increasingly important position; while the percentage of food and general civilian products in the total foreign trade value is shrinking day by day. Taking the export of military products as an example, the export volume of the United States in 1951 increased by one and a half times compared with 1950. In the first half of this year, the military products exported by the United States increased by 33 percent compared with the first half of last year. In 1950, the military products imported by Western European countries from the United States accounted for only 14 percent of the total import value, but last year, they accounted for more than 40 percent. Other major capitalist countries also have a large number of military exports. To give an example, the total value of weapons and shells exported by the United Kingdom last year increased by 43 percent compared with 1949. In the first half of this year, the military products exported by the United Kingdom also increased by 42 percent compared with the same period last year.

    The composition of imported goods also shows the aggressive intentions of the imperialist countries. In order to step up war preparations, the United States stockpiled a large number of strategic materials. It is estimated that the United States alone had stockpiled 1.5 million tons of natural rubber, 2 million tons of copper, 680,000 tons of aluminum, and 400,000 tons of tin by the end of last year. All of this is sufficient to reflect that "the economic development of capitalist countries has taken on a one-sided military nature" (Malenkov).

    However, the war preparation policy and economic militarization of the capitalist countries will inevitably lead to more and more goods and raw materials being consumed for non-productive military purposes, or becoming a large number of strategic stockpiles. On the one hand, it will greatly reduce the production of civilian products (from February to July this year, US industrial production has declined by 13.5 percent), leading to more serious unemployment, which will further exacerbate the imbalance between production capacity and the ever-shrinking purchasing power of the people. On the other hand, in the imperialist market, because military supplies are increasingly replacing the status of civilian products, it will deepen the parasitic and decadent nature of the foreign trade of the imperialist countries, thereby weakening and destroying the commodity market of the capitalist world. In this way, the capacity of the imperialist market will shrink day by day, which will inevitably bring about a new and greater economic crisis.

    From this, we can see very clearly that the foreign trade of the countries of the democratic camp serves to develop the peace economy, expand economic cooperation, and maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society; while the foreign trade of the imperialist countries serves to militarize the national economy, step up the enslavement and plunder of the people of other countries, and seize the maximum capitalist profits. There are two fundamentally different trade systems in the two mutually opposed world markets, which determine two different development prospects. The democratic world market is moving along the road of universal prosperity and balanced development; while the development of the imperialist market presents extreme instability and imbalance.

    As far as the current trade situation is concerned, many vivid facts are sufficient to illustrate the prosperity of the democratic world market. From 1948 to 1952, the total trade volume between the countries of the peace and democracy camp increased by more than two times. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, its current foreign trade volume reaches 18 billion rubles per year, equivalent to three times that before the war. In 1950, Poland's foreign trade volume was about twice that before the war, Bulgaria was twice that of 1948, and the development of other Southeast European countries was roughly the same. The foreign trade of New China has developed even more surprisingly. We have shifted from imports exceeding exports for 73 years to a balance of trade. Last year's foreign trade volume increased by another two times compared with 1950. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the proportion of trade between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has reached an unprecedented level. This year, the proportion of the People's Democratic countries in the total foreign trade volume of the Soviet Union reached 80 percent. The percentage of trade between our country and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in the total value of foreign trade also increased from 26 percent in 1950 to 61 percent in 1951, and will reach 70 percent this year.

    In the capitalist world, due to the high degree of imbalance in economic development after the war, a deformed phenomenon has been created in foreign trade, that is, the trade of all capitalist countries with the United States is in a deficit position. For all Marshallized countries, since the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" in 1948, their annual trade deficit with the United States has averaged about 3 billion US dollars, and the highest has reached 3.5 billion US dollars. Taking the three major capitalist countries in Western Europe as examples, from 1948 to the first half of this year, the trade deficit of the United Kingdom has increased by more than two times, France has increased by one-half, and Italy has also increased by about two times. In 1951, the proportion of the United States in the total import value of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and other countries had increased by two times compared with before the war, and it was about half more in Mexico, Uruguay, Colombia, and other countries. In addition, compared with 1937 and 1951, the US exports to the Near East countries have increased by ten times, and the exports to Southeast Asia and Oceania have also increased by about three and a half times.

    Since 1950, as the West German and Japanese monopoly capital groups have desperately expanded outward, they have gradually become strong rivals in the capitalist world market, which has further deepened the contradictions in the imperialist camp and the unbalanced development of international trade between capitalist countries. The total export value of West Germany in 1950 was almost twice that of 1949, and last year it increased by 70 percent compared with 1950. In one year last year, West Germany's exports to Iran increased by two times, to India by three times, and to Africa by two and a half times. As for Japan's exports, they also pose a serious threat to other capitalist countries. Its total export value in 1950 was 60 percent more than in 1949, and last year it increased by about two times compared with 1950. Cheap Japanese goods, especially textiles, have flooded Southeast Asia, India, and Pakistan, (In the first half of this year, Japan's exports of cotton textiles exceeded those of the United Kingdom by 24 percent.) causing panic in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Australia. Because the imbalance in the development of capitalist countries usually leads to the violent destruction of the equilibrium state in the world capitalist system after a considerable period of time, and those capitalist countries that believe they do not have sufficient raw material production areas and sales markets usually attempt to use force to redivide the world. As Comrade Stalin said, "The struggle between capitalist countries for markets and their desire to drown their competitors is, in practice, more intense than the contradiction between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR")

    From the current trade situation of the two markets and their development laws, we can easily point out their development prospects. The democratic world market is expanding day by day, and the trade relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will become closer and more consolidated. Therefore, the long-term trend of trade development will inevitably show a continuous linear rise. The equal and mutually beneficial long-term economic agreements signed by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are a powerful guarantee for the increasing prosperity of the democratic world market. For example, according to the long-term agreement signed by the Soviet Union and Poland in June 1950, the average annual trade volume between the two countries from 1951 to 1958 will exceed the actual average annual trade volume between 1948 and 1950 by 60 percent.

    Contrary to the development situation of the democratic world market, today the imperialist market is shrinking day by day, and the trade relations between the capitalist countries will become more and more deteriorated and divided. Therefore, the long-term trend of their trade development is no longer to continue to rise, but to decline relatively. According to preliminary estimates, the total trade value of the capitalist world market in the first half of this year has decreased by 2.5 billion US dollars compared with the first half of 1951, and the total trade volume has also decreased by 3 percent. The simultaneous reduction in total trade value and total volume is the first time since World War II, which profoundly shows the increasingly shrinking of the imperialist market. Taking the United States as an example, its total export value has been continuously decreasing since 1947. The highest record in 1947 was 15.3 billion US dollars, but it fell to 10.2 billion US dollars in 1950, a decrease of almost one-third. In 1951, relying on the export of a large number of weapons and military supplies, it increased again to 15 billion US dollars. The export situation of the United States in the first half of this year has shown a state of stagnation. Recently, John Kinsey, the export department manager of a company in Detroit, had to publicly admit: "American machine tool manufacturers have always exported 20 percent of their total production, but at present, they can only export 6 percent, and this ratio is still decreasing." The instability of US exports will make the contradictions between it and the United Kingdom, France, and other capitalist countries more intense. Since 1949, West Germany and Japan have also participated in the market scramble, which has gradually reduced the percentage of the United States in the total export value of the capitalist world. In 1947, it still accounted for 32.6 percent, but by the end of last year, it had been reduced to 19.7 percent.

    In order to dominate the capitalist world market, alleviate its increasingly serious economic crisis, and frantically prepare for war and further plunder the resources of the capitalist world, the US monopoly capital groups have forced those vassal countries to implement embargoes and economic blockades against the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, attempting to strangle us. What is the result? Not only can they not "strangle" us, but they "suicide" themselves. The economic ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are like copper walls and iron walls. Embargoes and blockades can only accelerate the development of the productive forces of the countries of the democratic camp and strengthen the economic cooperation between the countries, which is to consolidate the democratic world market. However, for the capitalist world, it has brought new crises and disasters, making the contradiction between their own industrial production capacity and the sales of industrial products even deeper. Before World War II, the traditional trade between Eastern and Western Europe always occupied an important position, accounting for about 60 percent of the total foreign trade of Europe, which was carried out within Europe in the past. Since the US imperialists interfered and prohibited Western European countries from trading with Eastern Europe, Western Europe's imports from Eastern Europe have been reduced by about three-quarters compared with before the war, and exports to Eastern Europe have also been reduced by about one-third. Taking 1950 as an example, Western Europe's imports of wheat, timber, and sugar from Eastern Europe were only one-quarter of those before the war, eggs were only one-third, and meat was less than half. This not only made the grain shortage and housing shortage in Western European countries more serious, but also disrupted the normal development of the national economies of Western European countries and deepened the internal contradictions of the entire world capitalist system.

    In fact, due to the increasingly sharp contradictions between capitalist countries, the result of the US imperialists' forced implementation of the economic blockade policy has encountered widespread resistance in the capitalist world. India, Pakistan, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon have begun to establish trade relations with our country. During the Moscow International Economic Conference, our country signed trade agreements worth 224 million US dollars with the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, and other countries. This specifically illustrates the disastrous defeat and increasing isolation of US imperialism.

    In addition, today, the trade settlement of the democratic world market is based on the world's most stable gold ruble (Since March 1, 1950, the ruble exchange rate has been increased by 32 percent), which will further ensure the prosperity and consolidation of the democratic world market; while the imperialist world uses the US dollar with an unstable currency value as the standard (In 1951, the purchasing power of the US dollar was only 43 percent of that in 1939), which has deepened the chaos and crisis in the imperialist market.

            ×　×　×

    Based on the above analysis, we can draw the conclusion: "The scope of the major capitalist countries (the US, the UK, and France) to seize world resources will not expand but will shrink; the conditions of the world sales market will deteriorate for these countries, and the phenomenon of insufficient start-up of enterprises in these countries will increase. This is the reason why the general crisis of the world capitalist system has deepened due to the disintegration of the world market." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR")

    Therefore, after the emergence of the two parallel world markets, the possibility of relative stability in the capitalist market no longer exists. The post-war period is a period of the growing strength of democracy, peace, and socialism, and the further weakening of the world capitalist system. From the development laws of the two markets, it is a period of the increasing prosperity of the democratic world market and the increasing shrinkage of the imperialist market.

    民主世界市场的繁荣和帝国主义市场的萎缩
    陶大吁
   “第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果，必须认为是统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解。这个情况决定了世界资本主义体系总危机的进一步加深。”
              ——斯大林著“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    第二次世界大战后世界的面貌，是根本改变了。从社会主义制度和资本主义制度的力量对比来看，它已发生了有利于社会主义的急剧变化。在政治方面，战后时期形成了两个对立的阵营：和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量日益壮大，帝国主义阵营的力量则一天天削弱。这“两个对立阵营存在之经济结果，就是统一的无所不包的世界市场瓦解了，因而现在就有了两个平行的也是互相对立的世界市场。”（斯大林著：“苏联社会主义经济问题”）
    这两个平行的世界市场的出现，深刻地暴露了世界资本主义经济的寄生性和腐朽性，它是资本主义总危机进一步尖锐化的集中表现；在另一方面，它具体地反映出来：战后的苏联已不是一个被资本主义国家所包围的孤岛了，中欧和东南欧的几个国家脱离了资本主义体系，中国人民摆脱了帝国主义的压迫，获得了解放，社会主义阵营的力量空前的增强。所以说，统一的世界市场的瓦解是第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果。
    在目前的国际形势下，这两个市场的基本阵容是很明显的。和平民主阵营国家的市场或民主世界市场是包括苏联、中华人民共和国、东南欧各人民民主国家（波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚）、德意志民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等国；而帝国主义侵略阵营的市场或资本主义世界市场则包括北美、中南美、西欧、近东、中东诸国、远东若干国家（中国不在内）和一些经济落后的殖民地和附庸国。这两个对立的市场正朝着相反的方向发展：新的民主世界市场是走向繁荣、走着上坡路；而旧的资本主义世界市场却走向萎缩、走着下坡路。一
    为什么两个市场会朝着完全相反的方向发展呢？从本质上看，由于两者是建立在根本不同的经济基础之上的。在苏联和各人民民主国家，和平经济的不断高涨与国民经济的有计划的发展，是为了保证最大限度地满足整个社会的物质和文化的需要，它们生产的不断增长，永远也不会伴随着经济危机，因而，在民主世界市场根本就不会感到销售的困难，它的容量是一年比一年增加；可是，现代资本主义经济的发展，却是“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”（斯大林）由于现代垄断资本集团的疯狂掠夺，就使资本主义社会内部的基本矛盾（即生产的社会性和占有的私人形式之间的矛盾）激化到火山爆发的程度：广大劳动人民的相对贫困化和绝对贫困化在日益加深、经常失业的人数在日益增多，社会购买力急剧下降的趋势日益加快，经济危机的风暴已日形险恶，这就必然会使每一个资本主义国家的市场问题愈来愈严重了。
    正因为两个世界的经济发展为不同的基本经济法则所影响和规定，所以，两个世界内各国之间的贸易关系，也表现着本质的不同。民主世界市场是以民主阵营各国间的兄弟关系和它们的共同利益作为基础，“这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”（斯大林）因而，民主阵营各国之间的贸易关系，是平等互利、友好互助的关系，这个经济合作关系的全面发展，必然会导致普遍的繁荣。今天，在苏联和各人民民主国家之间，不但签订了网形的贸易协定，并已缔结了长期的经济协定，使各国的经济合作进入了一个新阶段。由于民主阵营各国拥有丰富的资源，每个国家不但可以找到发展本国经济所必需的物资，并可为国民经济的长期的有计划的发展，提供极其优越的物质条件。
    然而，在帝国主义市场方面，各国之间的经济关系，却表现为奴役与被奴役、剥削与被剥削的关系，在这里，当然不会有经济上的平等和合作，所有的，只是不等价交换、关税壁垒和市场争夺战。斯大林同志早就指出：资本主义“世界经济发展所处的环境，是各帝国主义集团为争夺市场、原料及扩大旧的势力范围而进行拚命的斗争”（“论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向报告的结论”）。第二次世界大战后，由于美帝国主义推行其扩张政策，妄图取得世界霸权，结果，就使资本主义世界市场的破裂状态更形恶化了。美、英之间的矛盾，因争夺石油、橡胶、有色金属、稀有金属、硫黄和羊毛的产地及过剩生产品的销售市场而日益激化。美国利用英国战后的经济困难，通过贷款、“马歇尔计划”和各种国际会议，加强对英国的政治和经济控制：摧毁了帝国优惠制（削减或废除了大英联邦内部大部分商品的优惠税率），削弱了英镑的地位
    （一九四九年曾迫使英镑贬值百分之三十），掠夺了英国工业品的传统市场（在东南亚、印度、巴基斯坦和南非等地），并从大英帝国的殖民地抢去了大批的战略物资（特别是橡胶、锡、铅、锰、羊毛、云母、苎麻等）。英国垄断资本集团并不甘心于美国的掠夺，也采取各种步骤，进行了猛烈的抵抗。最近（十一月二十七日）在伦敦召开英联邦经济会议的主要目的之一，就是为了加强英镑区国家在金融上与商务上的联系，来对抗美国扩张主义的意图。此外，美国对西欧、中、南美和中东、近东诸国的掠夺，也是变本加厉。从“马歇尔计划”到
    “杜鲁门第四点计划”，从“国际货币基金”到“欧洲货币基金”，从“欧洲支付同盟”到“大西洋支付同盟”，名目尽管不同，实质上都是为了加强美元系统，打破别国的贸易限额和关税壁垒，为美国的剩余商品和剩余资本找寻出路。今天的西欧，实际已经成为美国的“统一市场”了。在不等价的交换和美货的倾销下，不仅使许多落后国家的工业和农业濒于破产，也进一步加深了资本主义国家国际分工的不正常、不稳定的性质。美国的金属品、机器设备、化学品、交通器材等项的出口价格，平均要比国内最高的市场价格超出三分之一。中、南美诸国向美国购买旧机器，甚至还比美国国内新机器的市价要贵两倍。在一九二九年时，一辆“福特”牌小汽车的市价，相当于二十袋巴西咖啡的价格；到一九五一年，却要二百袋巴西的咖啡，才能换到一辆美国汽车。这是不等价交换的一个典型，它充分表明了美国对外贸易的寄生性和腐朽性。此外，委内瑞拉的石油业、智利的铜矿、玻利维亚的锡矿、古巴的烟草业、埃及的植棉业、土耳其的棉织业、伊拉克的枣园，以及东南亚的橡胶业等，都在美国垄断资本的排挤、摧残和吞噬之下而相继破产了。二
    如果我们分析一下商品的构成，就更可把两个世界市场的贸易情况，来作一个鲜明的对照。在民主世界市场这一边，苏联和各人民民主国家发展对外贸易，主要就是为了加速经济建设、扩大各国间的经济合作和提高全民的物质和文化生活水平。为了帮助人民民主国家早日完成工业化和社会主义建设，苏联运送给各国的机器和其他技术设备，都是最新式和最便宜的，今年输出的数量，就相当于一九四八年的十倍。在苏联和各人民民主国家已签订的贸易协定中，还规定以工厂（如机器制造工厂，汽车拖拉机工厂等）、发电厂、矿场、油井等所需的全套装备和机器供应它们。这样，就为各国国民经济的长期的有计划的发展，奠定了巩固的基础。
    从各人民民主国家所交换的商品来看，彼此都充分做到了有无相通，各得所需。波兰的主要输出品有煤、锌、铁、钢、各种机器和农产品；捷克斯洛伐克输出钢铁、五金、机器、玻璃、纸张、靴鞋、药品、织物和砂糖；匈牙利输出各种运输机械工业的产品、电料，编织物和许多农产品；罗马尼亚的输出，以木材、石油、轻工业品等为大宗，保加利亚输出水泥、矿物、烟草和许多工业原料，阿尔巴尼亚则输出石油、沥青和农产品。而德意志民主共和国输出的工业品和我国输出的许多种矿产品和工业原料，都占了很大的比重。随着各人民民主国家工业的飞跃发展，各种生产资料的输出所占的比重，是一天天提高了。
    至于帝国主义市场的情形，就完全不同了。帝国主义各国经济的军事化，不仅加深了它们之间的矛盾，并且打乱了资本主义世界的贸易体系。目前主要资本主义国家工业生产的重要特点，就是军火订单的不断增涨和民用工业的日益衰落，它在这些国家去年对外贸易的商品构成上，反映得尤其突出。在资本主义世界市场上，军火、战略物资及其他军事工业品的贸易，已占居愈来愈重要的地位；而粮食和一般民用品在对外贸易总额中所占的百分比，却一天缩小一天。拿军火输出来看：美国一九五一年的输出量，就比一九五○年增加了一倍半。今年上半年，美国输出的军火，又比去年上半年增加了百分之三十三。在一九五○年，西欧各国从美国输入的军火，仅占进口总值的百分之十四，到去年，竟占到百分之四十以上。其他主要资本主义国家，也有大量的军火输出。举个例吧：去年英国输出武器和炮弹的总值，已比一九四九年增加了百分之四十三，今年上半年，英国输出的军火，也比去年同一时期增加了百分之四十二。
    在进口货的构成上，同样显示了帝国主义国家的侵略企图。为了加紧备战，美国囤储了大量的战略物资。据估计，仅美国一国，在去年年底时，就足足囤储了一百五十万吨的天然橡胶、二百万吨的铜、六十八万吨的铝和四十万吨的锡。所有这些，都足以反映“资本主义国家的经济发展带上了片面的军事的性质”（马林科夫）。
    但是，资本主义国家的备战政策和经济军事化的结果，必将使越来越多的货物和原料消耗在非生产性的军事用途上，或者变成了大量的战略存货。它一方面会大大地削减民用品的生产（从今年二月至七月，美国工业生产已下降了百分之十三·五），酿成更严重的失业现象，也就进一步恶化了生产能力和日益缩小的人民购买力之间的不平衡状态；另一方面，在帝国主义市场上，由于军需品日益替代了民用品的地位，它将加深帝国主义国家对外贸易的寄生性和腐朽性，从而削弱和破坏了资本主义世界的商品市场。这样，就将使帝国主义市场的容量日益萎缩下去，它必然会带来一个新的更大的经济危机。三
    由此我们可以非常清楚地看出：民主阵营国家的对外贸易是为发展和平经济、扩大经济合作以及最大限度地满足社会的物质和文化的需要而服务的；而帝国主义国家的对外贸易却是为国民经济军事化、加紧奴役和掠夺别国人民、以攫取最大限度的资本主义利润而服务的。两个互相对立的世界市场，存在着两种根本不同的贸易体系，它决定了两个不同的发展前途。民主世界市场正循着普遍繁荣、平衡发展的道路迈进；而帝国主义市场的发展，却呈现着极端的不稳定与不平衡。
    就贸易现状来看，许多生动的事实足以说明民主世界市场的欣欣向荣。从一九四八年到一九五二年，和平民主阵营各国之间的贸易总量已增加了两倍以上。以苏联而论，它现在的对外贸易额每年可达一百八十亿卢布。相当于战前的三倍。在一九五○年，波兰的对外贸易额已约比战前超出了一倍，保加利亚则为一九四八年的两倍，其他东南欧诸国的发展情况，也大致相仿。新中国的对外贸易更有惊人的发展。我们已从七十三年来的入超转为贸易的平衡。去年的对外贸易额又比一九五○年增加了
    一倍。特别值得提出的，就是苏联对各人民民主国家间的贸易比重，已有空前的提高。拿今年来说，在苏联对外贸易的总额中，各人民民主国家所占的比重就达到百分之八十。我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易量，在对外贸易总值中所占的百分比，也从一九五○年的百分之二十六增为一九五一年的百分之六十一，今年则可达到百分之七十。
    在资本主义世界，由于战后经济发展的高度不平衡，在对外贸易上造成了一个畸形的现象，就是各资本主义国家对美国的贸易，都处于逆差的地位。就全部马歇尔化国家来说，从一九四八年实行“马歇尔计划”以来，它们每年对美国的贸易逆差，平均每年约达三十亿美元，最高曾达三十五亿美元。以西欧三个主要资本主义国家为例，从一九四八年到今年上半年止，英国的贸易逆差，已增加了一倍多，法国增加了二分之一，意大利也约增加了一倍。一九五一年时，美国在阿根廷、巴西、智利等国输入总额中所占的比重，已比战前增大了一倍，而在墨西哥、乌拉圭、哥伦比亚等国，则约多出了一半。此外，倘以一九三七年与一九五一年相比，美国对近东国家的输出已增加了十倍，就是对东南亚和大洋洲的输出，也约增加了三倍半。
    从一九五○年起，由于西德和日本垄断资本集团拚命向外扩张，现已逐渐成为资本主义世界市场上的劲敌，这就进一步加深了帝国主义阵营的矛盾和资本主义国家间国际贸易的不平衡发展。西德的出口总值，一九五○年已比一九四九年将近多了一倍，去年又比一九五○年增加了百分之七十。在去年一年内，西德对伊朗的输出增加了一倍，对印度增加了三倍，对非洲也增加了二倍半。至于日本的输出，也给予其他资本主义国家以严重的威胁。它在一九五○年的输出总值，已比一九四九年多了百分之六十，去年更比一九五○年增达一倍光景。廉价的日本货，特别是纺织品，已充斥于东南亚、印度和巴基斯坦等地，（今年上半年，日本棉织品的输出，已比英国超过了百分之二十四。）引起了英国、荷兰和澳大利亚的惶惶不安。由于资本主义各国间发展的不平衡，通常是经过相当时期便要引起世界资本主义体系内均势状态的猛烈破坏，而那些认为自己没有充分原料产地和销售市场的资本主义国家，通常是企图运用武力来重新瓜分世界的。正如斯大林同志所说：“资本主义国家间争夺市场的斗争以及它们想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望，在实践上是比资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的矛盾更为剧烈。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”）四
    从两个市场的贸易现状及其发展规律，我们就不难指明它们的发展前途了。民主世界市场正在一天天扩大，苏联和各人民民主国家之间的贸易关系，将更形亲密和巩固，因而，贸易发展的长期趋势，必然显示为不断的直线式的上升，苏联和各人民民主国家所签订的平等互利的长期经济协定，就是民主世界市场日益繁荣的有力保证。例如：一九五○年六月苏联和波兰所签订的长期协定，两国在一九五一年至一九五八年内的每年平均贸易额，就要比一九四八年至一九五○年间的每年实际平均贸易额超过百分之六十。
    与民主世界市场的发展情况相反，今天帝国主义市场正在一天天缩小，各资本主义国家之间的贸易关系，将更形恶化和分裂，因而，它们贸易发展的长期趋势，不再是继续上升，而是相对地下降。根据初步估计，今年上半年资本主义世界市场的贸易总值，已比一九五一年上半年减少了二十五亿美元，在贸易总量上，也减少了百分之三。像这样贸易总值和总量的同时减少，还是第二次世界大战以后的第一次，它深刻地显示了帝国主义市场的日趋萎缩。就说美国吧，它从一九四七年以来，输出总值是不断地减少了。一九四七年的最高纪录为一百五十三亿美元，到一九五○年，已跌为一百零二亿美元，差不多减少了三分之一。一九五一年靠着大批武器和军用物资的输出，才再度增为一百五十亿美元。今年上半年美国的输出情况，显已呈现着停滞状态。最近，底特律某公司出口部经理约翰·金塞也只好公开承认：“美国工作母机制造商一向输出他们全部生产的百分之二十，但在目前，他们只能输出百分之六，而且这个比率还在减退着。”美国输出的不稳定性，将使它与英、法及其他资本主义国家间的矛盾更趋剧烈。从一九四九年起，西德和日本也参加了市场的争夺战，就使美国在资本主义世界出口总额中所占的百分比，逐步降落了。在一九四七年，它还占到百分之三二·六，到去年年底，已减为百分之一九·七了。
    美国垄断资本集团为了独霸资本主义世界市场、缓和其日趋严重的经济危机，并为了疯狂备战、进一步掠夺资本主义世界的资源，就强迫那些仆从国家，对苏联、中国和各人民民主国家实施禁运和经济封锁，企图来窒杀我们。结果怎样呢？非但“窒杀”不了我们，反而“自杀”了他们。苏联和各人民民主国家之间的经济联系，犹如铜墙铁壁，禁运也好，封锁也好，它们只能加速民主阵营各国生产力的发展和加强各国间的经济合作，也就是反而巩固了民主世界市场。可是，对于资本主义世界来说，它却带来了新的危机和灾难，使它们自己的工业生产能力和工业产品销路两者之间的矛盾更为加深。在第二次世界大战以前，东西欧之间的传统贸易，一向是占重要地位的。大概占欧洲对外贸易总额的百分之六十左右，过去是在欧洲内部进行的。自从美帝国主义干涉和禁止西欧各国与东欧进行贸易以来，西欧从东欧的输入额已约比战前减低了四分之三，对东欧的输出额也约减少了三分之一。以一九五○年为例，西欧从东欧输入的麦类、木材和食糖，仅及战前的四分之一，鸡蛋只有三分之一，肉类不到一半。这不但使西欧各国的粮荒和房荒更形严重，并且破坏了西欧各国国民经济的正常发展和加深了整个世界资本主义体系的内部矛盾。
    事实上，由于资本主义各国间的矛盾日益尖锐化，美帝国主义强制实施经济封锁政策的结果，已经在资本主义世界遭遇到普遍的抵抗。印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印尼和锡兰等国，已开始与我国发生贸易关系。在莫斯科国际经济会议时期，我国就曾与英、法、瑞士等国签订了价值二亿二千四百万美元的贸易协定。这就具体地说明了美帝国主义的惨败和日益陷于孤立。
    加以，今天民主世界市场的贸易结算，是以世界上价值最稳定的金卢布为标准（从一九五○年三月一日起，卢布外汇率已提高百分之三十二）它会进一步保证民主世界市场的繁荣和巩固；而帝国主义世界则以币值不稳定的美元为标准（一九五一年美元的购买力仅及一九三九年的百分之四十三），这就加深了帝国主义市场的混乱和危机。

    根据以上的分析，我们就可以得出结论：“各主要资本主义国家（美、英、法）夺取世界资源的范围，将不会扩大而会缩小；世界销售市场的条件对于这些国家将会恶化，而这些国家的企业开工不足的现象将会增大。这也就是由于世界市场瓦解而使世界资本主义体系总危机加深的原因。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”）
    所以说，两个平行的世界市场出现以后，资本主义市场相对稳定的可能性不再存在了，战后时期已是民主、和平、社会主义力量日益壮大，与世界资本主义体系进一步削弱的时期，从两个市场的发展规律来看，它就是民主世界市场日益繁荣和帝国主义市场日趋萎缩的时期。
