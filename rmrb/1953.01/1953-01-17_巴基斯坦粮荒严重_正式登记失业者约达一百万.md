    Maulvi Muhammad Islamuddin of the Muslim League stated in the West Punjab Provincial Legislative Assembly that the people in four districts of the Multan region are eating grass, and many of them are on the verge of starvation. The prices of grain and bread have risen, so most people dare not even ask about them.
