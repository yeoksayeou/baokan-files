    Notice and Correct the Formalistic Tendencies in Materials Exchange Meetings

    To the Editor: At the end of last year, primary markets in various parts of Central and Southern China held materials exchange meetings one after another, which played a significant role in enlivening the market and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. However, some regions did not sufficiently recognize the significance of materials exchange meetings and failed to do a good job in organization and publicity beforehand, resulting in formalistic tendencies. At the materials exchange meeting held in Chengguan District, Yongfu County, Guangxi Province, there were only over twenty trading representatives, while there were more than seventy people engaged in cultural and entertainment work. After the trading representatives arrived at the meeting, they were busy watching operas and looking at the excitement, treating the materials exchange meeting as an entertainment meeting. The people in charge of the materials exchange meeting also abandoned their leadership, resulting in many chaotic phenomena during the trading process. The peasants reflected one after another: such materials exchange meetings, those who sell cannot sell, those who buy cannot buy, but it delays production. Don't come again next time!
    Similar situations to the above have occurred in many areas in the Central and Southern region. It is hoped that the local industrial and commercial management departments will strengthen the leadership of the primary market materials exchange meetings and thoroughly correct the formalistic tendencies in the materials exchange meetings.

    注意纠正物资交流会中的形式主义偏向
    编辑同志：去年年底，中南各地初级市场先后召开了物资交流会，对活跃市场、促进城乡物资交流起了很大作用。但有些地区对物资交流会的意义认识不足，事前没有做好组织与宣传工作，以致发生了形式主义的偏向。在广西省永福县城关区举行的物资交流会上，交易代表一共只有二十余人，而搞文化娱乐工作的却有七十多人。交易代表到会后，都是忙着看戏、瞧热闹，把物资交流会当成了娱乐会。主持物资交流会的人也放弃了领导，以致在交易过程中发生了许多混乱现象。农民们纷纷反映：这样的物资交流会，卖的卖不出，买的买不到，反而耽误了生产，下次可不要再来了！
    类似上面的情况，在中南区还有不少地区发生过。希望各地工商管理部门加强对初级市场物资交流会的领导，彻底纠正物资交流会中的形式主义的偏向。        胡储
