Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 23rd: TASS reported from New York on January 23rd that William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, issued a lengthy statement to the press on behalf of the CPUSA National Committee, denouncing the US ruling group's conspiracy to persecute thirteen leaders of the Communist Party USA. The statement said: "The conviction of thirteen Communist leaders in Foley Square under the Smith Act is to punish them for daring to speak out against the Korean War and for advocating peace. This verdict, like the indictment and trial, is a product of the current war hysteria."

Foster pointed out: The second trial of Communists in Foley Square followed exactly the same method as the previous trial, which resulted in the imprisonment of senior Communist leaders. He said: "This is a typical example of a hostile bourgeois court framing and inevitably convicting Communists. Newspapers, radio broadcasts, television, and all news outlets have created an atmosphere of lynching against Communists... moreover, the jurors were carefully selected as the most suitable for carrying out such reactionary schemes expected of them."

Foster analyzed the anti-democratic jury system, which systematically excluded jurors who might fairly try Communists. Foster continued: In the current atmosphere of persecution of progressives and war hysteria, any honest judge who advocated a verdict of not guilty would clearly face the threat of unemployment and intimidation by the FBI. Foster said: "The task of the jury now is to convict all Communists brought before them, regardless of the facts."

    美共全国委员会主席福斯特发表声明
    痛斥美国统治集团迫害十三名美共领袖
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特代表美共全国委员会向报界发表了长篇声明，痛斥美国统治集团迫害美国共产党十三个领袖的阴谋。声明说：“根据史密斯法在福莱广场判定十三个共产党领袖有罪，是为了惩罚他们敢于发言反对朝鲜战争和拥护和平。这个裁决和起诉与审讯一样，是目前战争歇斯底里的产物。”
    福斯特指出：福莱广场第二次审讯共产党人是完全依照上一次的审讯办法，上一次审讯的结果把共产党高级领袖关进监狱。他说：“这是敌对的资产阶级法庭诬陷和必然地把共产党人判罪的典型例子。报纸、无线电广播、电视和一切发布消息的机关都造成一种对共产党私刑审讯的气氛……而且陪审团的人员是经过仔细挑选的最适宜于干这种期待他们干的反动勾当的。”
    福斯特分析了反民主的陪审制度，这个制度有计划地排斥了那些可能公平审讯共产党人的陪审员。福斯特继续说：在目前迫害进步人士和战争歇斯底里的气氛中，如有正直的法官主张宣判无罪，那么他显然就会遭到失业的威胁和受到联邦调查局的恫吓。福斯特说：“目前陪审团的任务就是不管事实怎样而把所有带到他们面前的共产党人判罪。”
