    【This newspaper reports】The Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration, the Electrical Industry Administration, the Electric Power Administration, the Nonferrous Metals Administration, and the Coal Mining Administration are actively engaged in the engineering design for this year's capital construction. These units have adopted a series of effective measures to ensure the timely delivery of construction drawings to construction departments by the end of March with planning and focus, ensuring that the vast majority of projects will commence construction in April as planned.
    The five units, including the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration, began the engineering design for 1953 last year. Due to the design tasks exceeding the design capacity and the poor planning of the initial design work, coupled with insufficient preparation of original data, the units faced difficulties in delivering the construction drawings on time. To overcome these difficulties and ensure timely delivery of the construction drawings, the units adopted a series of effective measures. First, the units strengthened the planning of design work, reviewed the workload required from the present until the delivery of construction drawings, and formulated specific plans for completing the design tasks based on the available time and manpower. This allows them to focus the main efforts on the main aspects and concentrate on the design of key projects. Second, the units created or promoted advanced design experiences. For example, the Civil Engineering and Architectural Design Group of the Design Department of the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration created the "Three-Stage Design Method," which increased design efficiency by nearly two times. In the past, one person designed two thousand square meters in six months; now, one person designs nine hundred square meters in one month. The design groups of the Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration universally promoted the "parallel assembly line operation" method in design work, which greatly improved work efficiency. Ji Zhangyou shortened the design time for a floor from twenty days to six days, and Song Feidi shortened the design time for a crane girder from six days to one and a half days. The Northeast Electric Power Administration also formulated design standards for secondary substations and transmission lines based on advanced Soviet experience. Third, the units established a level-by-level inspection system to strengthen design review work. In the past, the design work lacked a sound inspection system, resulting in numerous loopholes and errors, repeated rework, and prolonged design time; the design review work also lacked a sound system, merely examining drawings for technical errors, and failing to review them from technical, economic, and political perspectives. Addressing these two shortcomings, the Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration established a level-by-level inspection system. According to the "assembly line operation" method, when a design "flows" from one person to another, it must undergo thorough inspection to ensure there are no errors before continuing the design. The Electric Power Administration created a new method for reviewing designs, which involves convening relevant departments such as the client, contractor, planning, technical, financial, and materials departments to participate in the design review simultaneously. This approach allows for reviewing a design from different perspectives, ensuring the quality and correctness of the design, and also allows for finalizing the design as soon as possible for the construction unit to start construction.
    Currently, the preliminary designs for most of the capital construction projects of these five key industrial units in the Northeast have been completed and are entering the technical design stage. It is expected that construction drawings will be delivered successively by the end of March, ensuring that most projects will commence construction on schedule.

    东北机械工业管理局等积极改进设计工作
    保证有计划有重点地把施工详图按期送到施工部门
    【本报讯】东北机械工业管理局、电器工业管理局、电业管理局、有色金属管理局和煤矿管理局等五个工业单位，正积极进行今年基本建设的工程设计。各单位采取了一系列的有效措施，保证有计划有重点地把施工详图在三月末送到施工部门，保证绝大部分工程按计划在四月开工。
    东北机械工业管理局等五单位去年已着手进行一九五三年的工程设计。由于设计任务大于设计能力和开始时的设计工作计划性较差、原始资料准备得不充分，各单位对于按时交出施工详图是有困难的。为了克服这些困难，保证按时交出施工详图，各单位采取了一系列的有效措施。首先，各单位加强了设计工作的计划性，清查了从目前起到交出施工详图止需要完成的工作量，并根据现有的时间和人力，作出最后完成设计任务的具体计划。这样，就可以有计划地把主要力量用到主要方面，突击重点工程设计。其次，各单位创造或推广了设计先进经验。例如东北机械工业管理局设计处土木建筑设计组，创造了“三段设计法”，设计效率提高近两倍。过去一个人六个月设计两千平方公尺，现在一个人一个月就设计了九百平方公尺。东北电器工业管理局设计处各设计小组，在设计工作上普遍推广了“平行流水作业”的工作方法，工作效率大大提高。冀章友设计一个楼面从二十天缩短到六天，宋斐迪设计一个吊车板梁由六天缩短到一天半。东北电业管理局也根据苏联先进经验，制订了二次变电和送电线路设计标准。第三，各单位建立逐级检查制，加强设计审核工作。过去，设计工作缺乏健全的检查制度，以致漏洞和错误层出不穷，屡次返工，拖长了设计时间；在设计审核工作上，也缺乏一套健全的制度，只是就图纸审查审查在技术上有无错误，而不能从技术、经济、政治多方面来审核。针对这两方面的缺点，东北电器工业管理局设计处建立了逐级检查制，根据“流水作业”的工作方法，当一项设计从这个人“流”到另一个人手里时，必须经过周密检查，确无错误，方准继续设计。电业管理局创造了审核设计的新办法，即召集甲方、乙方、计划、技术、财务、材料等有关部门同时参加审核设计。这样，从不同角度审核一项设计，保证了设计的质量和正确性，同时也可以尽快地最后决定设计，交施工单位施工。
    目前，东北这五个重点工业单位的大部分基本建设工程的初步设计已结束，正进入技术设计的阶段。预计到三月底，施工详图即可陆续交出，保证大部分工程按期开工。
