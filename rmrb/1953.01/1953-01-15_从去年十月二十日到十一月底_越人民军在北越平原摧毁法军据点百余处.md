Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army intensified operations in the North Vietnamese plains. From October 20th to the end of November last year, they destroyed a total of 120 French military strongholds, eliminating enemy forces ranging from one platoon to three companies in each battle. The People's Army launched attacks on the main transportation lines of the French army, destroying more than 100 French military vehicles.

The people in the North Vietnamese plains also cooperated with the People's Army in combat, destroying important enemy highways, rendering the two main highways in the Red River Delta controlled by the enemy – Highway 60 and Highway 62 – nearly paralyzed.

Due to the frequent ambushes by the People's Army and the sabotage of highways by the people, the French army was forced to use tanks to patrol shorter sections of road, and frequently deploy a company to a battalion of troops to defend Highway 30 in Thai Binh province.

The Vietnamese People's Army thwarted the French army's attempts to improve the shortage of food and water within isolated strongholds. For example, on November 24th last year in Hung Yen province, 200 French puppet troops attempted to relieve the besieged French troops in Nhi Xuyên and An My and transport supplies, but were intercepted by the local Vietnamese forces, resulting in 120 enemy soldiers being annihilated. On November 21st, the French army ordered the 4th Mobile Group to relieve the French military stronghold in Kien Dong, but were intercepted by the People's Army, resulting in over 100 deaths and 20 captures.

    从去年十月二十日到十一月底
    越人民军在北越平原摧毁法军据点百余处
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社十三日讯：越南人民军在北越平原加紧作战，从去年十月二十日到十一月底，共摧毁法军据点一百二十处，每次战斗歼灭敌军一个排到三个连不等。人民军对法军的主要交通线进行袭击，击毁法军车辆一百辆以上。
    北越平原地区人民也配合人民军作战，破坏敌人的重要公路，使被敌人控制的红河三角洲的两条主要公路——第六十号和第六十二号公路，近于瘫痪。
    由于人民军伏击和人民破坏公路的频繁，法军被迫使用坦克在较短的路段上巡逻，并在太平省经常动用一个连到一个营的兵力防守第三十号公路。
    越南人民军使法军改善孤立据点内缺粮、缺水的企图遭到失败。例如，去年十一月二十四日在兴安省，二百名法伪军企图帮助尼川和安美二地被困的法军解围和输送给养，但遭到越南地方部队的截击，被歼一百二十人。十一月二十一日，法军命令第四机动团为剑东的法军据点解围，但被人民军截击，死一百人以上，被俘二十人。
