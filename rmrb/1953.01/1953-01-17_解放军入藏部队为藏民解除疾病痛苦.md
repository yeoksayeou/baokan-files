    PLA Troops Entering Tibet Relieve Tibetan People of the Suffering of Illness
    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Liberation Army entered the Kangzang area in 1950, it has provided medical treatment to the Tibetan people more than 100,000 times. Along the way, after the troops set up camp, Tibetan people would carry patients from ten or even a hundred *li* away to ask the troops' medical personnel for treatment.
    Our medical staff have dedicated all their strength and talent to the lives and health of the Tibetan people. On one occasion, a lama's guard accidentally fired his gun, and the bullet penetrated his stomach. The doctor from the health department operated on him overnight and removed the bullet. However, due to excessive blood loss, the patient was on the verge of death. The responsible comrade from the sanatorium immediately donated his own blood to the patient, saving his life. Another time, one of the Dalai Lama's attendants suffered from pneumonia and was so ill that he couldn't even drink tea. His family was busy preparing for his funeral. Doctor Li Chunlan from the health department treated him and saved his life.
    In addition, the troops have established clinics in Lhasa and built a hospital to treat Tibetan people. Dagza Lama of the Gourd Temple said: "In the past, when we got sick, we had to go to Kalimpong in India for treatment. Now that you have come, we no longer need to go to Kalimpong."

    解放军入藏部队为藏民解除疾病痛苦编辑同志：
    中国人民解放军入藏部队自一九五○年进入康藏地区以来，已为藏民诊治了十万次以上。沿途，部队宿营以后，藏族人民便从十里、甚至百里以外，抬着病人来请部队卫生人员诊治。
    我们的卫生工作人员，为了藏民的生命和健康，贡献了他们的全部力量和才能。有一次，一个喇嘛的警卫员，因枪走火，子弹穿进肚子里，卫生部的大夫便连夜给他施手术，取出了弹头。但因失血过多，病人濒于死亡的状态，休养所的负责同志马上将自己的血输给病人，挽救了他的生命。又有一次，达赖喇嘛的一个侍卫患了肺炎，病得连茶水都不能喝了，家里人都忙着给他办后事。卫生处李春兰大夫就给他治疗，把他的生命挽救过来了。
    此外，部队还在拉萨设立了门诊所，并建立了一所医院，给藏族人民看病。功德林寺的打札喇嘛说：“从前我们有了病要到印度噶林堡去治疗，现在，你们来了，我们再也不用到噶林堡去了。”
