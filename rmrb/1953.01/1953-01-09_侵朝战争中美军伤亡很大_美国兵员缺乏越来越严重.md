Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The American aggressors are single-mindedly trying to continue and expand their war of aggression against Korea, but their manpower difficulties are becoming more serious.

The American aggressor troops have suffered more than 320,000 casualties in the more than two years of the Korean War, and troops are becoming increasingly scarce. U.S. Department of Defense planners already admitted in November of last year that manpower shortages were a serious problem in the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, especially in the Army and Marine Corps. They also revealed that the regular forces in the United States were becoming increasingly empty, and some units were only empty shells. The combat strength of U.S. domestic army units has been reduced by almost half on average. Only one division in the United States has maintained close to its prescribed strength. This situation has recently become more serious with the increase in American casualties on the Korean front. A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman admitted on the 4th of this month that the manpower shortage will worsen in the coming months.

In order to make up for this fatal weakness, the American aggressors are now stepping up their conscription efforts. The U.S. Department of Defense has requested the Selective Service System to provide 53,000 new recruits in February of this year. All new recruits will be assigned to the Army. The Associated Press said that this is the largest conscription in nearly two years. According to the Associated Press, due to the resistance of the American people to conscription, the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have restored their original enlistment systems. The U.S. Department of Defense has also recently lowered the physical examination standards for military doctors. Those who were originally rejected for enlistment due to visual and auditory impairments, physical defects, hidden ailments, and other diseases are now prepared to be accepted.

However, the conscription work is proceeding too slowly, and the water from afar cannot quench the immediate thirst. The American army has no choice but to extend the rotation period in order to maintain the number of soldiers. The U.S. Far East Command announced on December 30th of last year that due to the lack of replacement soldiers, the rotation points for U.S. rear units in Japan and Korea have been increased from 38 points to 40 points. The Far East Command said, "If the rotation continues based on 38 points in January, the combat effectiveness of the Eighth Army and other army units under the Eighth Army headquarters cannot be maintained."

In addition to this, the difficulties encountered by the American aggressors in replenishing troops are: a large number of American soldiers who are unwilling to sell their lives for the monopoly capitalists have deserted, reaching an "alarming proportion." The American "Louisville Times" recently reported that the U.S. military now has 25,000 to 30,000 deserters. In order to cover up this situation, the U.S. Department of the Army hurriedly came out to deny it, but as a result, it admitted to a larger number of desertions. According to Reuters, U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel McAuliffe admitted at a press conference that since the beginning of the Korean War, the U.S. military has had as many as 46,000 deserters. In addition, McAuliffe also revealed that an average of 20,000 U.S. soldiers "leave without saying goodbye" every month, and these are not included in the deserter account. From these figures revealed by the U.S. military itself, people can see how low the morale of this U.S. aggressor army, which attempts to conquer the world, is.

    侵朝战争中美军伤亡很大
    美国兵员缺乏越来越严重
    【新华社八日讯】美国侵略者一心要继续和扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，但是它在人力方面的困难却更加严重了。
    美国侵略军在两年多的朝鲜战争中伤亡了三十二万多人，兵员越来越缺乏。美国国防部的策划人员在去年十一月间就已经承认，人力不足在美国的陆海空三军中都是严重问题，尤其在陆军和海军陆战队中。他们还透露，美国国内的正规部队越来越空虚了，某些部队只剩下一个空架子。在美国国内陆军部队的战斗力量平均减低了几乎一半。在美国只有一个师保持了接近于规定的实力。这种情形，最近随着美军在朝鲜前线伤亡增加而更加严重了。美国国防部的发言人在本月四日承认，兵员缺乏的情况会在未来几个月中更加恶化。
    为了弥补这个致命的弱点，美国侵略者现在加紧了征兵工作。美国国防部已经要求征兵局在今年二月份供给五万三千名新兵。所有的新兵都要拨给陆军。美联社说，这是将近两年来征兵最多的一次。据美联社报道，由于征兵遭到美国人民的抗拒，美国的海军、海军陆战队和空军都已恢复原来的募兵制。美国国防部最近还降低了军医的入伍体格检查标准，原来因为视听不方便，有生理缺陷和隐伏痼疾以及其他疾病而被拒绝入伍的，现在也准备接受了。
    但是征兵工作进行得太缓慢，远水救不得近火，美国军队只好延长轮换期限，来保持兵员的数额。美军远东司令部在去年十二月三十日宣布，由于缺乏补充的兵员，日本和朝鲜境内美军后方部队的轮换点数已经由三十八点增加到四十点。远东司令部说，“如果在一月间根据三十八点继续轮换，就不能维持第八军以及第八军总部所辖的其他陆军部队的战斗力。”
    除此之外，美国侵略者在补充兵员上遭遇到的困难是：不愿替垄断资本家卖命的美军士兵大批逃亡，已经达到“惊人的比例”。美国的“路易斯维尔时报”最近报道，美军的逃兵现在有两万五千到三万人。为了掩饰这一情况，美国陆军部急忙出来否认，结果却承认了一个更大的逃亡数字。据路透社报道，美国陆军专管人事的副参谋长麦克奥里夫在记者招待会上承认，从朝鲜战争开始以来，美军的逃兵已经有四万六千人之多。此外，麦克奥里夫还透露，平均每个月都有两万名美军士兵“不告而别”，而这些还都不算在逃兵账上。仅仅从美国军方自己透露出来的这些数字，人们就可以看出，这支美国侵略者企图用来征服全世界的军队的士气是多么的低。
