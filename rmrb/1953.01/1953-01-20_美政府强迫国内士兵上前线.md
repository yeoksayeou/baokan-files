    US Government Forces Domestic Soldiers to the Front Lines
    The U.S. Department of the Army, due to the serious problem of desertion among U.S. troops, has ordered the adoption of high-pressure measures. On January 15, the Department of the Army issued an order stating that soldiers who "abandon their posts" and evade overseas service will be forcibly "escorted" and put on the "first available ships" to be sent to the Korean battlefield.
    Can the U.S. Department of the Army guarantee that they will not "abandon their posts" again?

    美政府强迫国内士兵上前线
    美国陆军部因美国军队中士兵逃亡现象严重，下令采取高压措施。陆军部十五日发布一道命令，凡是“擅离职守”、逃避海外服役的士兵将用武力“押送”，装上“第一批船只”解往朝鲜战场。
    美国陆军部能担保他们不再一次“擅离职守”吗？
