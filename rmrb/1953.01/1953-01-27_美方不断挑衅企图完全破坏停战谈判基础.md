Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 26th: The provocative actions of the US side at Panmunjom are increasing daily. At 8:40 PM on the 23rd, the US side again shelled the conference area. More than seventy pieces of shrapnel were found in the conference area. This is the fourth time US artillery has bombarded the neutral conference area since the US side unilaterally broke off the armistice negotiations last October.

	The US's continuous provocations as the Eisenhower administration prepares to expand the war are particularly noteworthy. Throughout the armistice negotiations, provocative actions have been a barometer of the US side's sabotage tactics. Provocations in the past ten days include:

	January 15th: The US liaison officer notified that the agreement not to attack the delegation convoys would be unilaterally torn up, effective January 25th.

	January 21st: US aircraft strafed a delegation convoy, wounding three members of the delegation.

	January 23rd: After ignoring our protests for a month and a half, the US liaison officer refused to acknowledge responsibility for the bombing of a delegation convoy on December 13th of last year; in that incident, five delegation members were injured.

	On the same day, US artillery shelled the conference area.

	January 24th: US aircraft violated the conference area twice.

	The arrogant attitude of the US liaison officers and the US military police at Panmunjom is in line with the US plan to tear up agreements and threaten the safety of the conference area and the neutral zone. The US liaison officer refused to acknowledge responsibility for violating the agreement and openly denied that US aircraft had violated agreements and understandings by flying over the conference area in a hostile manner.

	The US military police on duty during the shelling of the conference area suddenly became deaf and blind for some inexplicable reason, even though our military police, who were not far from them, heard the whistling of the shells and saw the fire and smoke from the shells exploding near the conference tents. Prior to this, our military police heard the sound of artillery firing from US positions.

	During the joint investigation, US security officer White prevented US military policeman Hesler from answering questions, ordering him: "Don't answer that." The US military policeman had to ask White, "Should I answer him?" even for a simple question like "Can you hear?". It is clear that the US military police were under orders not to reveal the truth and to obstruct the investigation.

	The next morning, when our military police asked the US military police to look at the US aircraft flying over the conference area, he looked everywhere except at the sky. After the US aircraft had passed, he looked up and said, "That was outside the conference area."

	In this small but famous Panmunjom, the world has already seen the most shameful record of the US government's sabotage and interruption of armistice negotiations; negotiations to which all peace-loving people had originally pinned great hopes.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 25th: In recent days, the US side has been manufacturing a continuous stream of provocative incidents in an attempt to completely destroy the basis of the Korean armistice negotiations. At around 8:40 PM on January 23rd, US artillery shelled the Panmunjom conference area, with shells exploding near the conference tents. Security officers from both sides of the conference area conducted a joint investigation, and both human and material evidence fully proved that this was a premeditated US conspiracy to sabotage the conference area agreement.

	At around 8:20 AM and 8:24 AM on January 24th, US military aircraft again violated the conference area agreement by intruding into the airspace above the conference area twice. Our chief liaison officer protested to the other side at the liaison officers' meeting on January 25th regarding the above two incidents. The US side flatly denied the incident of US military aircraft violating the conference area on January 24th, and adopted a delaying tactic regarding the US shelling of the conference area on January 23rd, claiming that it would continue to investigate. Our side sternly condemned the US attempt to deny the facts, pointing out that when US military aircraft violated the conference area, the US military police present at the scene refused to be responsible for conducting a joint observation under the instruction of their superiors. This fact of the other party's refusal to conduct a joint observation further proves that the other party is planning to undermine the various administrative agreements of the armistice negotiations. Our side further pointed out: In recent days, the US side has denied the facts of violating the agreement, openly torn up the agreement between the two sides, strafed our delegation vehicles, and is now shelling the conference area and constantly infringing on the airspace above the conference area with military aircraft. This series of events that continuously undermine the various administrative agreements of the armistice negotiations further exposes the US side's conspiracy to completely overturn the basis of the armistice negotiations in order to expand the Korean War. The US side must bear full responsibility for this series of planned provocative actions and their serious consequences.

### 美方不断挑衅企图完全破坏停战谈判基础

    美方不断挑衅企图完全破坏停战谈判基础
     【新华社开城二十六日电】美方在板门店的挑衅行为正在日益增加。二十三日下午八时四十分美方又炮击会场区。会场区一共发现了七十多块炮弹碎片。自从去年十月美方中断停战谈判以来，这是美国大炮第四次轰击中立的会场区。
    正当艾森豪威尔政府准备扩大战争之际，美国连续进行挑衅，是值得特别注意的。在停战谈判过程中，挑衅行为一直是美方的破坏策略的晴雨表。过去十天来的挑衅行为共有：
    一月十五日：美方联络官通知将自一月二十五日起片面撕毁代表团车队不受攻击的协议。
    一月二十一日：美方飞机扫射代表团车队，打伤代表团人员三名。
    一月二十三日：在不理睬我方抗议一个半月以后，美方联络官拒绝承认去年十二月十三日轰炸代表团车队的责任；在该次事件中，有五个代表团人员受伤。
    同日，美国大炮轰击会场区。
    一月二十四日：美国飞机两次侵越会场区。
    美方联络官和在板门店的美方军事警察的蛮横态度，是与美方企图撕毁协议并威胁会场区和中立区安全的计划相配合的。美方联络官拒绝承认破坏协议的责任，并公然否认美方飞机含有敌意地飞越会场区是违反协议和谅解的。
    在炮击会场区时值班的美方军事警察，为了某种不可告人的原因，突然装聋作瞎起来，虽然离他们不远的我方军事警察听到了炮弹的嘶嘶声，看到了这些炮弹在会场帐篷附近爆炸时发出的火光和烟雾。在此以前，我方军事警察听到了美军阵地发射大炮的声音。
    在联合调查中，美方保安军官怀特阻止美方军事警察黑士勒回答问题，命令他：“不要回答那个。”美方军事警察对“你能听见吗？”这样一个简单的问题都必须问问怀特，“我要不要回答他。”显然美方军事警察奉有命令不得吐露真情，并要妨碍调查。
    在第二天早晨，当我方军事警察要美方军事警察看美国飞机飞越会场区的情况时，他到处都看，就是不看天空。当美国飞机过去以后，他抬头望望说：“这是在会场区以外。”
    在这个小小的但是著名的板门店，全世界已看到了美国政府破坏和中断停战谈判的最可耻的纪录；而所有爱好和平的人民原是对这个谈判寄以很大希望的。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】连日来美方层出不穷地制造挑衅事件，企图完全破坏朝鲜停战谈判的基础。一月二十三日下午八时四十分左右，美方炮击板门店会场区，炮弹在会议帐篷附近爆炸。双方会场区安全军官进行了共同调查，人证和物证都充分地证明了这是美方有计划地破坏会场区协议的预谋。
    一月二十四日上午八时二十分与八时二十四分左右，美方军用飞机又违反会场区协议，两次侵入会场区上空。我方首席联络官在一月二十五日双方联络官会议上就上述两次事件向对方提出抗议。美方竟矢口抵赖一月二十四日美方军用飞机侵越会场区事件，对一月二十三日美方炮击会场区事件，则采取拖延态度，声称继续进行调查。我方严正斥责美方抵赖事实的企图，指出当美方军用飞机侵越会场区时，美方在场的军事警察在其上级授意下拒绝负责进行共同观察。对方这一拒绝共同观察的事实，更足证明对方正有计划地破坏停战谈判的各项行政协议。我方更指出：连日以来，美方抵赖破坏协议的事实，公开撕毁双方协议，扫射我方代表团车辆，现在又炮击会场区，并不断以军用飞机侵犯会场区上空。这种连续发生的破坏停战谈判各项行政协议的事件，进一步暴露了美方彻底推翻停战谈判基础，以便扩大朝鲜战争的预谋。美方对这一系列有计划的挑衅行动及其严重后果，必须负完全责任。
