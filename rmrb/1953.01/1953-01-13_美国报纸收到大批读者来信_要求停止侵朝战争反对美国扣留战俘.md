Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th - American newspapers have received a large number of letters from readers demanding an end to the Korean War and opposing the US detention of prisoners of war. These letters fully demonstrate the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the policies of their rulers.

The New York "Daily Worker" recently reported several typical examples of such letters published in many American newspapers. The "Daily Worker" reported on January 5th that Thomas Aitkinson, a veteran of the Korean War, wrote to his hometown newspaper, the "Louisville (Kentucky) Courier-Journal," suggesting that the United States should sincerely seek peace. He said: "The premise for considering all issues related to peace should be that we are willing to accept peace, even if it undermines the false prosperity generated by the war economy. ...Let the North and South Korean people reunify their divided country, and no one else should interfere..." The same day, the "Daily Worker" also reprinted a letter from Paul Rovenger, a reader of the "Brooklyn Eagle." Rovenger said that the US government often states that continuing the war is for the so-called "moral principle of not forcibly repatriating prisoners of war," but "at the same time, we see in one incident, United Nations guard troops shooting and killing eighty-four unarmed prisoners of war and wounding one hundred and eighteen. We don’t seem to be able to describe this kind of thing as defending moral principles..."

The "Daily Worker" reported on January 1st that the Newburgh, New York newspaper "Newburgh News" also published a typical letter from a female reader in the city regarding the issue of prisoners of war. This reader appealed to the women of America in her letter, writing: "I also want to say, why don't the women of America wake up quickly, unite together, and urge the return of prisoners of war to their countries so that our children can come home?...”

The "Daily Worker" reprinted a letter on December 31st last year from Isabel Kiddy, a mother of two sons serving in the military from North Bergen, New Jersey, to the "Hudson Dispatch" under the title "Is America to continue sending its children to Korea to die?" In her letter, she asked everyone to write to Eisenhower to protest. She said angrily in the letter, "If we don't rise up and end this war, can we sleep peacefully at night? I tell you, I cannot."

### 美国报纸收到大批读者来信  要求停止侵朝战争反对美国扣留战俘

    美国报纸收到大批读者来信
    要求停止侵朝战争反对美国扣留战俘
    【新华社布拉格十日电】美国报纸接到大批读者要求停止朝鲜战争、反对美国扣留战俘的来信，这些信充分说明美国人民对于他们的统治者的政策已越来越不满了。
    纽约“工人日报”最近报道了许多美国报纸上发表的这一类信件中几个典型的例子。一月五日的“工人日报”报道说，朝鲜战争中的退伍军人托马斯·艾特金逊写信给他故乡的“路易斯维尔（肯塔基州）信使日报”，建议说：美国应该真心诚意地谋求和平。他说：“在考虑一切有关和平的问题时应该根据的前提是：我们愿意接受和平，即使这样会破坏战争经济产生的虚假繁荣。……让南北朝鲜人民重新统一他们的分裂的国家，别人不得干涉……”同一天的“工人日报”还转载了“布鲁克林鹰报”的读者保罗·罗文吉尔的一封信。罗文吉尔说，美国政府经常表示继续战争是为了所谓“不得强迫遣返战俘的道义原则”，但是，“同时我们却看见在一次事件中联合国的看守部队开枪打死手无寸铁的战俘八十四人，并打伤一百十八人。我们似乎无法把这种事情说成是捍卫道义原则……”
    “工人日报”在一月一日报道说：纽约州纽堡市的报纸“纽堡新闻”也发表了该城一个女读者写来的一封关于战俘问题的典型的信。这位读者在信中向美国的妇女发出呼吁，她写道：“我也要说，美国的妇女们为什么不赶快醒来，团结在一起并促使把战俘送回他们本国以便使我们的孩子们回家呢。……”
    “工人日报”在去年十二月三十一日转载了有两个儿子在军中服役的新泽西州北比尔根城的依萨贝尔·基迪太太写给“赫德逊报”的一封信，题目是“难道美国要不断把它的孩子派到朝鲜去送死吗？”她在信中要求大家都写信给艾森豪威尔向他提出抗议。她在信里愤激地说：“如果我们不起来终止这个战争，我们能在晚上安睡吗？我告诉你，我不能够。”
