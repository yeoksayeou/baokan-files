    Deepen Coal Sales in Rural Areas
    Tian Zhongmin
    The work of state-owned coal and building materials companies in various regions to promote coal sales in rural areas has achieved initial success and experience. When they first started promoting coal sales in rural areas, some leading cadres lacked confidence, believing that "rural areas have plenty of firewood, and farmers are unwilling to spend money to buy coal." However, after two years of effort, the work of promoting coal sales in rural areas in provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, and Suiyuan has gradually expanded from pilot projects to a wider scale. Currently, coal can be generally supplied to areas within a hundred li on both sides of the railway in these provinces. The Jinan Coal and Building Materials Branch in Shandong Province has promoted coal sales in counties such as Wudi and Yangxin, more than three hundred li away from the railway, meeting the needs of farmers for coal.
    Various regions have created many good methods in the work of promoting coal sales in rural areas. Farmers in the Zhuoxian area of Hebei Province did not have the habit of burning coal in the past. The cadres of the local coal and building materials business office actively promoted the significance of burning coal for the patriotic production increase movement to the farmers, and used the method of carefully calculating accounts to show that burning coal is cheaper. For example, a family of five needs to burn ten jin of firewood a day, costing two thousand yuan. If they burn coal, they only need five jin, costing two hundred and fifteen yuan. If everyone burns coal, they can save a large amount of wood for the country, which can be used in construction. After calculation, the old habit of the masses burning firewood instead of coal was reversed. However, the masses did not have bellows, making it very difficult to burn coal. The coal and building materials business office organized local scattered carpenters to manufacture bellows and hand them over to the cooperatives for sale, which enabled a large amount of coal to reach rural users. The staff of the Suzhou Coal and Building Materials Company went deep into the brick and tile kilns to conduct visits and learned that the kiln owners in Chenmu Town in the city had negative thoughts of eating and using everything up after the "Five-Anti" campaign; the workers believed that burning bricks with rice straw was a tradition passed down from generation to generation, and they were afraid that coal would not burn well. Based on this situation, the company's cadres first invited the town mayor and the person in charge of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to convene a meeting of representatives of kiln owners to explain that the kiln industry has a promising future, and that burning kilns with coal is cheaper than using firewood, which can expand operations. Then, they invited the town trade union to convene a meeting of workers to explain that rice straw is a raw material for paper making, and switching to burning coal can reduce the consumption of paper making raw materials. In order to solve the ideological concerns of whether burning bricks with coal can reduce costs and whether bricks can be burned well, they also organized a workers' tour group to visit the Luxu Town kiln, which had already switched to burning coal. The kiln owners in Luxu Town detailed their achievements in burning bricks with coal. Burning kilns with rice straw requires 600 dan per kiln, costing 6 million yuan, producing 75,000 bricks; now burning coal, each kiln only needs 10 tons, costing 3 million yuan; plus 180 dan of straw, costing 1.8 million yuan, for a total of 4.8 million yuan, with an average of more than 100,000 bricks produced per kiln. This not only saves 1.2 million yuan in fuel, but the bricks burned are also more numerous and stronger. Through this method, in October of last year, 43 of the 67 kiln owners in the town switched to using coal.
    Organizing coal to go to the countryside through cooperatives is the most important way to promote coal sales. Coal and building materials companies must closely contact cooperatives, go deep into rural areas, understand the needs for coal, help cooperatives solve specific difficulties, and strengthen the confidence of cooperatives in managing coal in order to open up sales in rural areas. The Jixian distribution office of the former Pingyuan Province initially contacted the Yanjin County Cooperative to sell coal, and the cooperative was only willing to sign a contract for 250 tons. The company later sent people to the Northwest Village Grassroots Cooperative in Yanjin County to understand the situation, conduct propaganda, and open up the thinking of the cooperative cadres, and immediately signed a contract for 1,000 tons of coal; later, it established connections with seven grassroots cooperatives, and negotiated back and forth with the county federation, and as a result, signed a contract for the sale of 12,000 tons of coal. Opening up new coal sales villages, consolidating old coal sales villages, ensuring a continuous supply, and facilitating users to buy coal are important methods for coal to go to the countryside. The Zhangjiakou Coal and Building Materials Branch divides a month into three periods: early, middle, and late. In the early ten days, it opens up new coal sales villages and new users. In the middle ten days, it universally supplies coal to new and old users once. In the late ten days, it concentrates on opening up new villages and new users to lay the foundation for coal sales in the next month. This method of opening up new users while continuously supplying old users can consolidate users and continuously increase sales.
    Organizing transportation, delivering goods on behalf of customers, and using returning trucks to transport coal are also good ways to organize coal to go to the countryside. The Chengyang Coal and Building Materials Business Office in Shandong Province adopts the method of buying coal by remittance, and providing delivery services on behalf of customers, which has been well received by the masses. The salesman of the Changle Coal and Building Materials Distribution Office in Shandong Province seized the opportunity of farmers delivering public grain near the grain bureau's warehouse to carry out publicity and mobilization, and organized coal transportation to the countryside, which has achieved great results.
    At present, there are still some shortcomings in the work of coal going to the countryside that urgently need to be improved. The main problem is that publicity and sales cannot be well combined. After vigorous publicity, the sales work cannot keep up. In some areas, there is also a tendency to seek the distant and neglect the near, simply extending to distant areas while ignoring the nearby blank spots, which will affect the effect of sales. Transportation must also be further organized to enhance the strength of the work in the countryside in order to make the coal sales work better developed.

    深入农村推销煤炭
  　田仲民
    各地国营煤业建筑器材公司深入农村推销煤炭的工作，已取得初步成绩和经验。开始下乡推销煤炭的时候，某些领导干部信心不足，认为“农村柴草多，农民不愿出钱买煤炭”。但经过两年来的努力，在河北、山东、绥远、河南等省下乡推销煤炭的工作已由点到面逐步开展起来。到目前为止，这些省的铁路两侧百里以内，已能普遍供应煤炭。山东济南煤建分公司在离铁路三百多里以外的无棣、阳信等县推销煤炭，满足了农民用煤的需要。
    各地在下乡推销煤炭的工作中，创造了许多良好的方法。河北省涿县一带的农民，过去没有烧煤的习惯。当地煤建经营处的干部积极向农民宣传烧煤对爱国增产运动的意义，并用算细账的方法，说明烧煤是便宜的。例如，一家五口人，一天要烧十斤柴，合二千元，如烧煤只用五斤，合二百一十五元。大家都烧煤，就能为国家节省大量木料，用在建设方面。经过算账，扭转了群众烧柴不烧煤的旧习惯。可是群众没有风箱，烧煤十分困难。煤建经营处就把当地零散的木工组织起来，制造风箱交合作社代销，这样就使大量煤炭深入了农村用户。苏州市煤业建筑器材公司职工深入烧砖瓦的窑户进行访问，了解该市陈墓镇窑主在“五反”后有吃尽用尽的消极思想；工人则认为用稻草烧砖是世代相传的，用煤恐怕烧不好。根据这一情况，该公司干部首先请镇长及工商业联合会负责召开窑业资方代表会议，说明窑业有发展前途，说明烧窑用煤比用柴成本低，可以扩大经营。接着请镇工会召开劳方会议，说明稻草是造纸原料，改烧煤炭可以减少造纸原料的消耗，为了解决用煤烧砖能否减轻成本，能否烧好砖的思想顾虑，又组织了工人参观团到已改用煤炭烧砖的芦墟镇窑去参观。芦墟镇窑户详细介绍了他们用煤烧砖的成绩，用稻草烧窑，每一窑需用六百担，计六百万元，产砖七万五千块；现在烧煤，每一窑只需用十吨，计三百万元；再加一百八十担草，计一百八十万元，共四百八十万元，平均每窑产砖十万块以上。这不但节省了燃料一百二十万元，烧成的砖又多又坚韧。通过这一方法，在去年十月份内，使该镇六十七家窑户有四十三家改用煤炭。
    通过合作社组织煤炭下乡，是推销煤炭的最主要方式。煤建公司必须密切联系合作社，深入农村，了解需煤情况，帮助合作社解决具体困难，加强合作社经营煤炭的信心，才能打开乡村的销路。原平原省汲县分销处最初与延津县合作社联系销煤，合作社仅愿订立二百五十吨的合同。该公司后来派人到延津县西北村基层社了解情况，进行宣传，打通了合作社干部的思想，当即签订了一千吨煤的合同；以后又与七个基层社建立连系，并与县联社往返交涉，结果签订了代销一万二千吨煤的合同。开辟销煤新村，巩固销煤旧村，保证源源供应，便利用户买煤，是煤炭下乡的重要方法。张家口煤建分公司把一个月分成上、中、下旬三个段落，上旬开辟销煤新村新用户，中旬对新旧用户普遍供应一次煤，下旬再突击开辟新村新用户，打下下月推销煤炭的基础。这样一面开辟新用户，一面不断供应旧用户的方法，就能巩固用户，使销量不断增加。
    组织运输，代客送货，利用大车回空运煤，也是组织煤炭下乡的好办法。山东城阳煤建经营处采用汇款买煤，代运代送的方式，群众反映良好。山东昌乐煤建分销处推销员在粮食局仓库附近，乘农民送交公粮的机会，进行宣传动员，组织运煤下乡，收到很大效果。 
    目前煤炭下乡工作中还存在着若干缺点，急待改进。主要是宣传与推销不能很好结合，在大力宣传之后，推销工作跟不上去；也有个别地区舍近求远，单纯远伸而忽视了附近空白点，这些都会影响推销的效果。在运输上也要进一步组织起来，增强下乡工作的力量，才能使煤炭推销工作开展得更好。
