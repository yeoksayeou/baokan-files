    I Love Geological Work
    Wang Renmin, Student of Beijing Geological College
    Geological work is such a desirable profession! There is every reason for people to call geological workers the "vanguard" of the combat troops, and I am often proud of such a glorious title.
    Young friends, you may ask me: How did you establish your ideal? And how do you approach your studies today?
    Speaking of these two questions, it's a long story. It started in 1952 when I was still a student at the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University; but I was about to graduate. Like many graduating classmates, I didn't know where to "go" in the future, so this question became our most pressing issue. At that time, I loved literature and once wanted to make literary creation my lifelong career. However, not long after, my ideal changed, and I became more interested in geological work. At this time, I read the article "Talking About Fantasy" in the first issue of "China Youth" in 1952, which had a great impact on me. A passage in this article read:
    An American college student wrote to a Soviet girl,
    asking her what she would like to do in the future. She replied: Geologist.
    The American youth wrote: "I disagree with your fantasy of becoming a geologist. It is a turbulent job, and it may not be suitable for a girl. I fantasize about buying a small house in a quiet place in the future, planting my favorite roses, and occasionally diagnosing a few patients by the fireplace every night. Perhaps our education is completely different, so I cannot understand your wishes, just as you cannot understand mine."
    "Yes, you are right." The Soviet college girl replied: "Our lives are completely different, so our fantasies are also worlds apart. I know that I will walk in the great forests, sleep in the
    open air and endure all kinds of hardships... But, with me
    are all true friends... We will undertake the arduous task of exploring for coal or
    oil, platinum or radium, these minerals will make
    people's lives better..."
    The words of the Soviet college girl deeply touched my heart. I am a member of the Youth League, and when the motherland is about to start large-scale economic construction, I should order myself: "Go to the post where the motherland needs it most!" "Go to the post where the task is the most arduous!" So, I bravely chose Beijing Geological College. When dividing into departments and majors, I was very honored to be assigned to the only special course in Beijing Geological College—the Geology and Mineral Resources Exploration Special Course. Two years later, I can be the first to step out of the gate of the Geological College and embark on the journey of exploring the rich resources of the motherland. Thinking of this, I am filled with incredible power.
    As everyone knows, the study in the special course is very intense, and it requires the students to put in more effort. Therefore, our slogan is: "Start together and resolutely not fall behind!"
    Of course, learning is not always smooth sailing. In the first few weeks of school, we also encountered many difficulties. For example, when studying crystallography, everyone was confused about the "face number," "symmetry elements," and
    "stereographic projection" of crystals, and it often took a lot of time to study a crystal. Especially for students who have not studied "solid geometry," it is particularly difficult to study crystals. But, what is difficulty! Soviet geological expert Rogginov said well: "The more difficult, the more glorious." Students gained courage from his words and were determined to overcome difficulties and master the rules of various crystals.
    At the beginning of the school year, some students in the special course felt "miserable," thinking that they were learning less than other students and were a head shorter than undergraduates; some students lacked confidence in their studies, and they doubted whether they could complete the learning tasks in two years. However, the study in the eight weeks since the beginning of the school year has proved that the special course is not a head shorter than the undergraduate course. It is only narrower in the "surface" of learning than the undergraduate course, but the height to be achieved is the same; the facts have also proved that as long as you work hard, coupled with planned learning, the knowledge about crystals can be fully mastered.
    Due to the increased confidence in learning, the students' learning enthusiasm has generally improved. In the geological laboratory, the students developed a strong affection for minerals and rocks. We pick up a specimen, observe it carefully under a magnifying glass, and study its color, luster, cleavage, fracture, hardness, and streak, etc. After the internship, we often review it, and never let an unfamiliar rock or mineral easily slip away from our hands. After only eight weeks of study, we have gradually changed from not knowing rocks to recognizing them, from being unfamiliar to familiar, from being daunted to developing feelings for them. On the playground and beside the earthen hills, students often surround the theodolite or level and concentrate on doing surveying practice. Regardless of the piercing cold wind, they insist on the internship. The students all say: "We will never stop until we have thoroughly mastered the techniques learned in class." Some students who have just come from the South have hands that are frozen red and swollen, but they still insist on the internship. If you ask him: "Why do you do this?" He will definitely answer you: "A geological engineer should have this kind of spirit!"

### 我爱好地质工作

    我爱好地质工作
    北京地质学院学生  王仁民
    我是北京地质学院专修科的学生。地质工作是多么令人向往的岗位啊！人们把地质工作者称作战斗部队的“尖兵”是完全有理由的，对于这样一个光荣的称号，我常常引以自豪。
    青年朋友们，你们或许要问我：你是怎样建立起自己的理想的？今天，你又以怎样的心情对待学习？
    关于这两个问题，说来也就话长了。那是在一九五二年开始的时候，当时我还是北京师范大学附中的一个学生；但是快要毕业了。和许多即将毕业的同学一样，我不知将来要“到那里去”，因此这个问题便成为我们最迫切的问题。这时我热爱着文学，曾经想以文艺创作做为自己的终身事业。但是，不久以后，我的理想变了，我对地质事业有了更大的兴趣。这时候，我读了“中国青年”一九五二年第一期上的“谈幻想”一文，它给了我很大的影响。这篇文章中有一段这样写着：
    一个美国的大学生写信给苏联一个女孩子，
    问她将来愿意做什么事情。她回答说：地质学
    家。
    这位美国青年写道：“我不同意您要做地质学家的幻想，这是一种动荡不安的工作，对于一个女孩子未必合适。我幻想着将来在一个安静的地方买上一座小洋房子，种上我最心爱的蔷薇花，每天晚上坐在壁炉旁偶而诊断几个病人。也许是我们所受的教育是完全不同的，因此我不能理解您的愿望，就如同您不能理解我的一样。”
    “是的，您说得很对。”苏联女大学生回信说：“我们的生活是截然不同的，因此我们的幻想也有天渊之别。我知道，我将走在大森林里，睡在
    露天风雨之中经受各种困苦……但是，和我在一
    起的都是真正的朋友……我们将负起探寻煤炭或
    石油、白金或镭的艰巨任务，这些矿藏都会使人
    们的生活变得更美好……”
    苏联女大学生的话深深地打动了我的心坎。我是一个青年团员，当祖国即将开始大规模经济建设的时候，应该命令自己：“到祖国最需要的岗位上去！”“到任务最艰巨的岗位上去！”于是，我勇敢地选择了北京地质学院。在分系分科时，我又非常荣幸地被分到了北京地质学院唯一的专修科——地质矿产勘察专修科。两年以后，我就可以首先迈出地质学院的大门，踏上勘察祖国富源的征途。想到这里，我周身充满了不可思议的力量。
    大家知道，专修科的学习是十分紧张的，它要求同学们拿出更大的力量。因此我们的口号是：“一致开步走，坚决不掉队！”
    当然，学习并不是一帆风顺的。在开学后几周的学习中，我们也遇到了不少的困难。譬如，学结晶学时，大家对于晶体的“面号”、“对称因素”和
    “赤平极射投影”等等，都搞不清楚，研究一种晶体，往往要花费很多的时间。特别是没有学过“立体几何”的同学，对于晶体的学习尤其感到困难。但是，困难又算得了什么！苏联地质专家罗吉诺夫说得好：“越是困难，就越光荣。”同学们从他的话里获得了勇气，决心克服困难，掌握各种晶体的规律。
    刚开学的时候，专修科有的同学感到“命苦”，觉得比别的同学学得少，比本科矮一头；有的同学学习信心不够，他们怀疑两年内能不能完成学习任务。但开学八周以来的学习，证明了专修科并不比本科矮一头，它只是比本科学习的“面”窄一些，但所要达到的高度是一样的；事实也证明了只要自己努力，再加上计划性的学习，关于晶体的知识是完全可以掌握的。
    由于学习信心的增强，同学们的学习情绪普遍提高了。在地质实习室里，同学们和矿物、岩石发生了浓厚的感情。我们拿起一块标本，在放大镜下仔细观察，研究它的颜色、光泽、劈开、断口、硬度和条痕等等。实习完了，又经常进行复习，决不让一块不熟悉的岩石或矿物轻易从自己手里溜走。经过短短的八个星期的学习，我们已经对岩石逐渐从不认识到认识、从生疏到熟悉、从望而生畏到发生感情了。在操场里、土山旁，同学们常常围着经纬仪、或者是水平仪在聚精会神地做测量实习。他们不管刺骨的寒风，坚持着实习工作，同学们都这样说：“不彻底掌握课堂上所学的技术，决不停止。”刚从南方来的同学，有的手冻得红肿了，仍然坚持实习。假如你问他：“为什么要这样做？”他一定会回答你：“作一个地质工程师，应该具有这样的精神！”
