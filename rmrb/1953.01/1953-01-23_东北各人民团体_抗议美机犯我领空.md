Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd. People's organizations in Northeast China jointly issued a statement, strongly protesting the provocative act of the U.S. government in sending special agent planes to intrude into our Northeast airspace for strategic reconnaissance, firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of January 21st, and calling on people from all walks of life in Northeast China to further strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and to shatter the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war in Asia. The statement said: "The people of Northeast China, standing at the forefront of our national defense and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, absolutely cannot sit idly by and tolerate this extremely serious provocative act by the U.S. government to expand its war of aggression. The people of Northeast China, together with the people of the whole country, have achieved brilliant victories in the past two years in economic construction, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and combating bacteriological warfare, powerfully supporting the victorious operations of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. At present, the U.S. government is frantically planning to expand its war of aggression, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. We call on people from all walks of life in Northeast China to be highly vigilant against the U.S. government's conspiracy and criminal actions to expand its war of aggression, to work even harder to implement the instructions of the China Peace Committee, to conscientiously and earnestly strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, to continue to vigorously support the Korean and Chinese People's Armies with practical actions, to thoroughly smash the U.S. government's conspiracy to expand its war of aggression, and to achieve greater victories in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea." The following are the organizations that signed the statement: Northeast Branch of the China Peace Committee, Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Northeast Student Federation, Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association, and Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles.
