Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: According to TASS, Moscow, January 12th: "Pravda" published an editorial on January 12th entitled "Promote the Resolutions of the World Peace Congress Among the Masses," stating: A widespread movement to publicize and explain the resolutions of the Vienna World Peace Congress is unfolding in various countries. Mass meetings of various kinds are being held everywhere with great enthusiasm to discuss the resolutions of the Vienna Congress. Delegates from various countries who participated in the Vienna Congress reported on the congress. Participants in mass rallies enthusiastically supported the various appeals of the World Peace Congress.

Holding various meetings to publicize the resolutions of the Vienna Congress is only the first step in the enormous movement to explain the historical documents of the Vienna Congress that is currently unfolding in various countries. Peace advocates regard the work of explaining the resolutions of the Vienna Congress to people all over the world as their primary responsibility. The movement to explain the resolutions of the Vienna Congress brings more city residents, farmers, women, and youth, and more people from colonies and dependent countries, into the active struggle for peace. Undoubtedly, the wider this movement is, the greater the scope and strength of the peace movement will be.

The work of publicizing the resolutions of the Vienna Congress is being carried out simultaneously with the work of more forcefully exposing the conspiracies and tricks of the warmongers. The enemies of peace will not abandon their evil conspiracies. In order to stifle the voices of peace advocates, reactionary governments are still barbarously persecuting delegates to the Vienna Congress. The U.S. State Department is revoking the passports of Americans who have attended the Vienna Congress and the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The British Labour Party is expelling Labour Party members who participated in the Vienna Congress in batches. The leadership of the Italian Christian Democratic Party expelled Member of Parliament Terranova, who participated in the Vienna Congress. Paraguayan police sent a group of prominent Paraguayan peace advocates to concentration camps and tortured them severely. Representatives to the Vienna Congress from Cuba, Brazil, and other countries have also been arrested. These tyrannical police actions show the extent to which the ruling groups of the U.S. and British aggressive blocs hate peace. However, millions of brave peace fighters represent the great movement of peace-loving people, and only fools believe they can be intimidated.

The peace movement, overcoming the stubborn resistance of imperialist reactionaries, is becoming increasingly stronger, more united, wider, and more organized. In the process of publicizing the resolutions of the Vienna Congress, millions more men and women have joined the ranks against the danger of war. In order to spread the noble call of the Vienna Congress to the masses, peace advocates are transforming this great people's movement into a huge, invincible force capable of crushing the inhuman conspiracies of imperialist aggressors and safeguarding and consolidating peace.
Xinhua News Agency, London, January 12th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 11th congratulating the achievements of the World Peace Congress. The statement said: The delegates to the congress, who came from almost all countries in the world and represented hundreds of millions of people, demonstrated the strength and unity of the world's peace forces. The resolutions passed by the delegates on all fundamental issues of world peace prove that if there is a genuine willingness to resolve all issues through peaceful negotiation, and not through war, then people of different political views and religious beliefs in various countries can reach agreement. We Communists pay particular attention to the Congress's firm call for an immediate end to the Korean War. A strong mass movement must now be launched in Britain to end the shameful Korean War. At the same time, efforts must be made to ensure that millions of people in Britain who hope to end the "Cold War" and prevent a Third World War support the World Peace Congress's letter to the governments of the five major powers calling for negotiations and the conclusion of a peace pact. We call on all Communists and supporters of the Communist Party to respond to the call of the British delegates to the Vienna Congress to organize delegations to visit Members of Parliament, hold meetings to make resolutions, and take other forms of activity to work for peace in Korea and for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. We call for strengthening the peace movement in factories and among residents. The broad representation of the British delegation to the Vienna Congress is proof of the British people's desire for peace.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论
    号召在群众中宣传世界人民和平大会决议
    英共号召英国人民贯彻执行维也纳大会决议
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“真理报”十二日以“在群众中宣传世界人民和平大会的决议”为题发表社论说：一个宣传并解释维也纳世界人民和平大会决议的广泛运动，正在各国展开。各地都以极大的热情举行各种群众会议，讨论维也纳大会的决议。参加维也纳大会的各国代表在会上作了报告。参加群众大会的人热烈拥护世界人民和平大会的各项号召。
    举行各种会议来宣传维也纳大会的决议，只是目前正在各国展开的解释维也纳大会的历史性文件的巨大运动的第一步。和平拥护者把向全世界人民解释维也纳大会的决议这一工作作为他们的首要责任。解释维也纳大会的决议的运动，使更多的城市居民、农民、妇女和青年，更多的殖民地与附属国人民，参加到争取和平的积极斗争中来。无疑地，这个运动越广泛，和平运动的范围与力量也就越大。
    宣传维也纳大会决议的工作是和更有力地揭露战争贩子的阴谋与诡计的工作同时进行的。和平的敌人不会放弃他们的罪恶阴谋。为了窒息和平拥护者的呼声，反动政府还在野蛮地迫害参加维也纳大会代表。美国国务院正在吊销参加过维也纳大会和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国人的护照。英国工党正在成批地开除参加过维也纳大会的保卫和平的工党党员。意大利天主教民主党领导机关开除了参加过维也纳大会的议员泰伦诺瓦。巴拉圭警察把一群著名的巴拉圭和平拥护者送进集中营并严刑拷打他们。古巴、巴西和其他国家的参加维也纳大会代表们也被逮捕。这种横暴的警察行动说明了美英侵略集团国家的统治集团憎恨和平到了什么程度。但是，千百万勇敢的和平战士代表着爱好和平的人民的伟大运动，只有傻子才相信能把他们吓倒。
    和平运动战胜了帝国主义反动派顽固的抵抗，正在日益强大，日益团结，越来越广泛，越来越有组织。在宣传维也纳大会决议的过程中，又有千百万男女参加了反对战争危险的行列。为了把维也纳大会的崇高号召传播到群众中去，和平拥护者正在把这个伟大的人民运动变成一个能够粉碎帝国主义侵略者仇视人类的阴谋、能够维护并巩固和平的巨大无敌的力量。 【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：英国共产党执行委员会在十一日发表声明，祝贺世界人民和平大会的成就。声明说：几乎来自全世界所有国家、代表着亿万人的大会代表们显示了全世界和平力量强大与团结。代表们就世界和平的一切基本问题通过的决议证明，如果真正愿意用和平谈判的办法、而不用战争的办法解决一切问题，那么政治见解和宗教信仰不同的各国人民是可以达成协议的。我们共产党员特别注意大会坚主立刻停止朝鲜战争的号召。现在必须在英国展开一个强有力的群众运动，争取停止可耻的朝鲜战争。同时必须设法使英国千百万希望终止“冷战”、防止第三次世界大战的人支持世界人民和平大会呼吁五大国进行谈判、缔结和平公约的致五大国政府书。我们号召全体共产党员与拥护共产党的人响应英国参加维也纳大会的代表们的号召，组织代表团到议员那里去，举行大会作出决议，以及采取其他活动方式为在朝鲜建立和平与争取五大国缔结和平公约而努力。我们号召加强在工厂里和在居民中间的和平运动。英国出席维也纳大会的代表团的广泛的代表性就是英国广大人民群众渴望和平的证明。
