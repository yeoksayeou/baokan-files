Northeast rural areas are universally drafting agricultural production plans for 1953 from top to bottom. Agricultural production plans at the provincial and county levels have already been formulated, and those at the district and village levels, as well as agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, are being actively drafted.

It is unprecedented this year for the rural areas of Northeast China to universally formulate agricultural production plans from top to bottom. Party and government leading organs at all levels in the region attach great importance to this work. Encouraged by the start of large-scale national construction, agricultural workers and the masses of farmers are also enthusiastically exploring the potential of agricultural production to formulate practical and feasible agricultural production plans. The planned total grain output for this year in each province has exceeded the planned output for the region by 2.7 percent. All localities are also focusing on creating large areas of high-yield fields and striving for universal high yields as the core of this year's plan. According to statistics from Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces alone, a total of more than 1.3 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) of high-yield fields are planned to be created this year. The area of high-yield fields in these three provinces accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of the total cultivated land area in each province; the unit area yield of high-yield fields is expected to increase by more than 50 percent compared to the actual output of the local area last year. Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, which was awarded the title of "High-Yield Model County" by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government last year, plans to create 5,000 hectares of high-yield fields with a yield of 10,000 jin of grain per hectare, 1,000 high-yield mutual aid teams, and 40 high-yield villages this year on the basis of further promoting the new cultivation methods of "equal-distance wide sowing, thinning and seedling protection, and phased topdressing." The implementation of this plan will increase the county's average unit area yield by 33 percent compared to last year.

In the process of formulating this year's agricultural production plans, Northeast China has conscientiously implemented the mass line working method. Provinces, counties, and districts have adopted the method of issuing production increase targets from above, submitting draft plans from below, and combining typical investigations to discuss and determine production plans at provincial agricultural work conferences and county and district people's representative conferences. The village production plan is drafted by the village people's representative conference, with the participation of mutual aid team leaders and agricultural labor models. The production plans of various agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers are formulated on the basis of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, with Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and agricultural labor models as the backbone, using typical demonstrations and gradual promotion methods, in a guided and organized manner. In this way, the shortcomings of disconnection between upper and lower levels and formalism in production plans are avoided.

While formulating the 1953 agricultural production plan, farmers in Northeast China are also carrying out various preparations for agricultural production. More than 50,000 farmers in Longhua County, Rehe Province, have dug 80 new wells, repaired 33 old wells, built 32 new canals, renovated 36 old canals, accumulated more than 2.06 billion jin of fertilizer, and earned more than 7.14 million jin of grain from sideline production. Farmers in Songjiang Province are also working hard on sideline production, seed selection, fertilizer accumulation, and manure delivery. Farmers in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, have used income from sideline occupations to buy 150 strong horses. Acheng, Hulan, and other counties are actively organizing the delivery of urban manure to the countryside to meet the needs of farmers' production. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 东北农村普遍拟订今年农业生产计划

    东北农村普遍拟订今年农业生产计划
    东北农村正由上而下地普遍拟订一九五三年农业生产计划。省、县两级的农业生产计划都已订出，区、村两级和农业生产合作社、互助组正在积极拟订。
    东北农村从上到下普遍拟订农业生产计划，今年还属创举。全区各级党、政领导机关都很重视这一工作。农业工作干部和农民群众在国家开始大规模建设的鼓舞下，也都热烈地挖掘农业生产的潜在力量，来拟订切实可行的农业生产计划。各省所订的今年全区粮食计划产量已超过该区所订的计划产量百分之二点七。各地还都以创造大面积丰产田、争取普遍丰产作为今年计划的核心。仅据黑龙江、松江、吉林三省统计，今年共计划创造大面积丰产田一百三十万余垧（每垧十五市亩）。这三个省的丰产田的面积，各占本省总耕地面积的百分之十到十五左右；丰产田的单位面积产量，要比当地去年的实际产量增产百分之五十以上。去年荣获中央人民政府农业部奖励为“丰产模范县”的黑龙江省肇源县，今年计划在进一步推行“等距宽播、间苗保苗和分期追肥”的新耕作方法的基础上，创造五千垧每垧产粮食一万斤的丰产田，一千个丰产互助组，四十个丰产村；这一计划的实现，将使该县今年的平均单位面积产量比去年提高百分之三十三。
    东北各地在拟订今年农业生产计划中，都认真地贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。省、县、区三级采取上发增产指标，下提计划草案，结合典型调查的方法，在全省农业工作干部会议和县、区人民代表会议上讨论确定生产计划。村的生产计划，由村人民代表会议吸收互助组组长和农业劳动模范参加讨论拟订。各个农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民的生产计划，则以农业生产合作社、互助组为基础，以共产党员、青年团员、农业劳动模范为骨干，运用典型示范、逐步推广的方法，有领导有组织地拟订。这样，就避免了生产计划上下脱节、形式主义等缺点。
    东北各地农民在拟订一九五三年农业生产计划的同时，并进行农业生产的各项准备工作。热河省隆化县五万多个农民已打新井八十眼，修复旧井三十三眼，开筑新渠三十二道，整修旧渠三十六道，积肥二十亿六千多万斤，经营副业生产获利七百一十四万多斤粮食。松江省农民也紧张进行副业生产和选种、积肥、送粪。该省双城县农民已用副业收入买进一百五十匹壮马。阿城、呼兰等县正积极组织城粪下乡，供应农民生产的需要。（新华社）
