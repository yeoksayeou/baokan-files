The East China Financial and Economic Committee Takes Measures to Correct Errors of Several Departments in Recklessly Spending Last Year's Surplus Funds

In the East China region, some departments in various provinces were unwilling to hand over the surplus funds from the 1952 budget to the national treasury. They rushed to spend the money at the end of 1952, some even violating state financial discipline in order to spend it.

The situation of these departments rushing to spend money can be seen from the statistics of the Joint Office in Shanghai of the Financial and Economic Committees of East China provinces: In December, the number of units in East China provinces entrusting the office to purchase goods suddenly increased by 2,750, and the amount of remittances increased by 61.5 billion yuan compared to November. Among them, cultural, educational, and health departments purchased more books, instruments, and medical equipment; many also purchased electric fans, typewriters, calculators, and bicycles. Many units purchased quantities exceeding normal needs. For example, the Suzhou Public Medical Care Section usually purchased 200 to 300 bottles of penicillin per month, but purchased 3,000 bottles in December; the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance purchased 30 calculators and 10 typewriters in December; a maternal and child health station in Zhejiang Province, which usually had small revenues and expenditures, spent 16 million yuan to buy a computer at the end of last year.

In order to spend the money, these units even signed contracts with private merchants, paid in advance, and postponed delivery. The former Southern Jiangsu Cultural and Educational Office purchased 1.5 billion yuan worth of books and instruments, with delivery agreed upon in April 1953; the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education purchased 3.6 billion yuan worth of radios, typewriters, and instruments, with delivery agreed upon in May 1953; the Fuzhou Transportation School ordered stationery and instruments for delivery in July 1953; the Hangzhou Construction Bureau ordered a dredging vessel worth 4.3 billion yuan, without even specifying a delivery date.

Many units' orders were for delivery in the summer of 1953. Although they paid a deposit, they feared they wouldn't be able to claim reimbursement in 1953, so they deposited the remittances in Shanghai and requested the Joint Office in Shanghai of the Financial and Economic Committees of East China provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Trade Trust Company to issue certificates for reimbursement in the 1952 final accounts. Some units even obtained invoices from private merchants in advance to take back for reimbursement.

In Shanghai, the engineering funds allocated to various basic construction units in December last year also increased by 110.4 percent compared to November. A significant portion of the increased funds were advance payments for contracts. Some of these contracts did not even specify a commencement date or number of working days. For some basic construction unit projects, state-owned construction contracting companies did not undertake the work, so these units eagerly sought private merchants to contract the work (84 cases were contracted by private merchants). When the private merchants contracting the projects said they lacked funds, some basic construction units instructed the private merchants to apply for loans from the Bank of Communications, and they interceded on their behalf.

After discovering the above phenomena of rushing to spend money and some units violating state financial discipline as a result of rushing to spend money, the East China Financial and Economic Committee has taken various measures to correct them. The Bank of Communications was ordered to refuse payment for contracts signed by basic construction units and contracting units without commencement dates and number of working days; those that had already been paid were to be re-examined and reported to higher authorities for a decision. For goods ordered by purchasing units that were not needed, the price was to be recovered and turned over to the national treasury; for goods ordered that were indeed needed, the unpaid amounts were to be recovered and turned over to the national treasury, and payments stipulated in the contracts to be made within 1953 were to be paid from the 1953 budget. Certificates or invoices issued but not actually paid were not allowed to be reimbursed in the 1952 budget. The East China Financial and Economic Committee also ordered the higher-level authorities of the respective units to seriously examine and handle incidents of violating state financial discipline due to rushing to spend money.

    华东财政经济委员会采取措施
    纠正若干部门乱花去年结余款项的错误
    华东区各省有些部门不肯将一九五二年预算中结余的钱上缴国库，纷纷在一九五二年年底抢着花钱，有的甚至不惜违反国家财政纪律，也要把钱花了。
    这些部门抢着花钱的情形，可以从华东各省财政经济委员会驻上海联合办事处的统计看出来：十二月份，华东各省汇款委托该办事处采购物品的单位突然增加了二千七百五十户，汇款额较十一月份增加了六百一十五亿元。其中文教卫生部门多采购图书、仪器和医疗器械；采购电扇、打字机、计算器、自行车的也不少。许多单位购货数量超过了正常需要。例如苏州市公费医疗科，平时每月购青霉素二百到三百瓶，十二月份却采购了三千瓶；福建省财政厅十二月份购买了三十架计算器，十架打字机；浙江省一个妇幼保健站平时收支数目并不大，去年年底竟花一千六百万元买了一架计算机。
    这些单位为了把钱花光，竟和私商订立合同，预先付款，延期取货。原苏南文教处购买十五亿元的图书仪器，约定一九五三年四月交货；浙江省文教厅购买价值三十六亿元的收音机、打字机和仪器等，约定一九五三年五月交货；福州交通学校购买的文具仪器订于一九五三年七月交货；杭州市建设局订购了价值四十三亿元的挖泥船，竟连交货日期也没有订。
    有不少单位的订货合同是一九五三年夏天交货，它们虽然预付了定金，但怕一九五三年无法报销，便将汇款存在上海，要求华东各省财政经济委员会驻上海联合办事处及上海市贸易信托公司代开证明信，在一九五二年决算中报销。有的单位甚至向私商预先取得发票拿回去报销。
    在上海的各基本建设单位，去年十二月份拨付的工程资金也比十一月份增加了百分之一百一十点四。增拨的款项，不少是合同预付款。其中有一部分合同连开工日期及工作天数亦未订明。有一部分基本建设单位的工程，国营建筑包工公司不承包，这些单位就迫不及待地找私商承包（私商承包者有八十四件）。承包工程的私商说资金不够，有的基本建设单位就叫私商向交通银行要求贷款，而他们则从旁说情。
    华东财政经济委员会发现上述抢着花钱和有些单位因抢着花钱而违反国家财政纪律的现象以后，已分别采取各种措施加以纠正。基本建设单位与包工单位所订合约无开工日期及工作天数者，令交通银行拒绝付款；已付款者重新审查报上级决定。各采购单位所订货物不合需要者，价款追回缴国库；订购货物确实需要者，未付款追回缴国库，合约内规定于一九五三年内到期付款者，在一九五三年的预算中支付。开了证明或发票实际上未付款者，不得在一九五二年预算内报销。华东财政经济委员会并责令各该单位的上级机关分别认真检查和处理因抢着花钱而违反国家财政纪律的事件。
