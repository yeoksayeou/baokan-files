Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 23rd: The U.S. side is systematically intensifying provocative incidents in order to further completely tear up the various administrative agreements related to the Korean armistice negotiations. At around 11:00 a.m. on January 21st, U.S. military aircraft, in violation of the bilateral agreement that delegation vehicles would not be subject to aerial attack, strafed our delegation's vehicles approximately six kilometers south of Hwangju, wounding three staff members of our delegation, two of whom were seriously injured. Our chief liaison officer lodged a serious protest with the other side on January 23rd regarding this matter. At the liaison officers' meeting that day, the other side also attempted to deny the serious incident of December 13, 1952, in which U.S. military aircraft bombed and strafed our delegation's vehicles near Angok-ri, north of Sariwon, wounding five members of our delegation. Our chief liaison officer pointed out: For several days, the other side has stubbornly denied its undeniable responsibility for the incident of December 13th of last year, unilaterally tearing up the agreement that delegation vehicles would not be subject to aerial attack, and once again strafing our delegation's vehicles. This series of serious provocative actions thoroughly exposes the other side's premeditated attempt to completely undermine the basis of the armistice negotiations in order to expand the Korean War. The other side must bear full responsibility for its actions of undermining and tearing up the agreement and for the serious consequences thereof. The full text of the protest lodged by our chief liaison officer with the other side regarding the January 21st incident is as follows:

To: Colonel Carrock, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

At approximately 11:00 a.m. on January 21st, your military aircraft strafed vehicles of our delegation, carrying red flag markings and traveling from Kaesong to Pyongyang, approximately six kilometers south of Hwangju, wounding three staff members of our delegation, two of whom were seriously injured. I lodge a serious protest with you regarding this provocative action of yours, which is yet another violation of the agreement. You have yet to provide any explanation for the serious incident of December 13, 1952, in which you bombed and strafed our delegation's vehicles, wounding five members of our delegation. Furthermore, on January 15th, you unilaterally announced that you would publicly tear up the original bilateral agreement that delegation vehicles would not be subject to aerial attack, starting on January 25th. Now, you have once again strafed our delegation's vehicles on January 21st, seriously injuring our delegation staff. This series of serious provocative actions thoroughly exposes your premeditated attempt to completely undermine the basis of the Korean armistice negotiations in order to expand the Korean War. You cannot escape full responsibility for undermining and tearing up the agreement and for the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    美方阴谋完全撕毁协议又派飞机扫射我代表团车辆
    我方联络官向美方提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美方正有计划地加紧制造挑衅事件，以便进一步完全撕毁有关朝鲜停战谈判的各项行政协议。一月二十一日十一时左右，美方军用飞机违反关于代表团车辆不受空中攻击的双方协议，在黄州以南约六公里处扫射我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团工作人员三人，其中二人重伤。我方首席联络官在一月二十三日就此向对方提出严重抗议。当日联络官会议上，对方并企图抵赖一九五二年十二月十三日美方军用飞机在沙里院以北安谷里附近轰炸扫射我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团人员五人的严重事件。我方首席联络官指出：几天来对方矢口抵赖对于去年十二月十三日事件对方不容抵赖的责任，片面撕毁关于代表团车辆不受空中攻击的协议，更又一次扫射我方代表团车辆。这一连串的严重挑衅行动，彻底揭露了对方完全破坏停战谈判基础以便扩大朝鲜战争的预谋。对方对其破坏与撕毁协议的行动及其严重后果，必须负完全责任。我方首席联络官对于一月二十一日事件向对方提出的抗议全文如下：联合国军代表团首席联络官卡洛克上校：
    一月二十一日十一时左右，你方军用飞机在黄州以南约六公里处扫射载有红旗标志自开城驶往平壤的我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团工作人员三人，其中二人重伤。对于你方这又一次破坏协议的挑衅行动，我向你提出严重抗议。你方对一九五二年十二月十三日轰炸扫射我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团工作人员五人的严重事件至今未作任何交代，你方在一月十五日更片面宣布将自一月二十五日起公开撕毁代表团车辆不受空中攻击的双方原有协议。现在，你方又在一月二十一日扫射我方代表团车辆，重伤我方代表团工作人员。你方这一连串的严重挑衅行动彻底揭露了你方完全破坏朝鲜停战谈判的基础以便扩大朝鲜战争的预谋。你方决不能逃脱破坏与撕毁协议以及由此而产生的严重后果的完全责任。
        朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军代表团
            首席联络官  朱然上校
                    一九五三年一月二十三日
