    A Major Reform in Construction Engineering Management
    – Preliminary Summary of Organizing Parallel Assembly Line Operations According to Instruction Charts
    Central Bureau of Basic Construction, Ministry of Heavy Industry

    Editor's Note: The parallel assembly line operation method is a successful experience in Northeast China's construction engineering. This summary was written by the Central Bureau of Basic Construction of the Ministry of Heavy Industry based on the experience in Northeast China's construction engineering last year. The content is relatively complete and comprehensive, and can be used by construction management cadres in various winter training courses for study.

    With the development of industrial construction, what frequently appears on construction sites are no longer one or several small buildings, but a large number of giant buildings. The old construction management methods are increasingly unable to meet the requirements of the new situation. On the other hand, the state's requirements for basic construction work are for shorter and shorter construction periods. This makes it imperative for us to carry out major reforms in construction management, so as to concentrate and organize various advanced operation methods, so as to maximize their effectiveness, overcome the backward and chaotic phenomena in past construction management, and constantly change the imbalance in the construction process, and carry out planned and rhythmic construction on large-scale construction sites. And "organizing parallel assembly line operations according to instruction charts" is the only method that can meet this requirement.

    The Emergence and
        Gains
    of Parallel Assembly Line Operations

    "Organizing parallel assembly line operations according to instruction charts" appeared after the "Three-Anti" and Responsibility System movements. In June of last year, the Electric Engineering Bureau of the former Northeast Industrial Department built a three-story brick and wood structure dormitory with a concrete floor of 2,918 square meters. In this project, Comrade Wang Sunci, inspired by the advanced Soviet experience, and with the strong support and technical assistance of the superior, improved the construction method and organized parallel assembly line operations, shortening the construction period from 120 days to 60 days. In the construction of another dormitory, the construction period was further reduced to 40 days. The Northeast Industrial Department attached importance to this advanced experience and summarized and promoted it in a timely manner. According to incomplete statistics, more than 70 projects have implemented this advanced construction method by the end of September last year. Twenty-six of the thirty-five construction sites of the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Industrial Department promoted the parallel assembly line operation method. The six-story building of Harbin Institute of Technology with 22,000 square meters has 15 million bricks, 340 tons of steel bars, more than 27,000 square meters of formwork, and 390 cubic meters of concrete. According to the past construction methods, at least 500 technicians were required, and the construction period would take two years. After the implementation of the parallel assembly line operation method, only more than 80 technicians were used, and the project was completed in seven months. In the Tiexi Workers' Village in Shenyang, the construction area totals more than 75,000 square meters. Thanks to the implementation of the parallel assembly line operation method for similar houses, all of them were completed in two months. Facts have proved that this advanced construction method generally shortens the construction period by one-third to one-half compared with the old construction method, so that areas that could only be constructed once can be constructed two or three times, and many units that could not complete the task have completed the state plan.

    The emergence of the parallel assembly line operation method has made the on-site work more rhythmic and several times more intense than in the past, fundamentally eliminating the chaotic phenomenon. Excellent labor quality and labor attitude are significantly growing in the construction site management cadres and workers. Many cadres have changed their past procrastinating work style and jumped out of the quagmire of day-to-day busywork. Material supply personnel can actively deliver materials in accordance with precise supply instruction charts to match the project progress. Technical management cadres also deeply realize that only by relying on the masses and learning from the advanced Soviet experience can there be a major turnaround in construction management. The workers have thereby mastered the plan and have a clear understanding of the entire building process. They no longer have to wait for the construction staff to assign work after going to work every day as in the past, but can take the initiative to start their own work as soon as they start working.

    The parallel assembly line operation method itself has strict planning and organization, and rationally fixes and uses labor force. It organizes all types of work to extensively implement advanced operation methods from the beginning to the end of the project construction. This makes all types of work on the site, from the time they are included in the plan, must closely cooperate with other work to move forward one after another; it also makes it easier for workers to become proficient and continuously improve their technical operations in the case of clear division of labor and labor specialization. This construction method urgently requires a few backward and weak links to improve the old labor organization, old operation methods, and even old labor attitudes, so as to open up a broader road for jointly creating and promoting advanced experience. At the same time, due to the establishment and implementation of the mass quality inspection system, the project quality has been substantially improved and guaranteed.

    Several Basic Experiences in Promotion

    According to the situation in Northeast China last year, what are the basic experiences in promoting "organizing parallel assembly line operations according to instruction charts"?

    1. Whether the parallel assembly line operation method can be promoted and implemented depends first and foremost on whether the leaders at all levels have unwavering confidence, especially whether the construction site leaders have sufficient understanding of this advanced experience that can accelerate the construction of the motherland. If the leaders are familiar with the business and are willing to study the business, and can support advanced and progressive things, they can humbly learn this advanced experience and resolutely organize or support the realization of this advanced experience. The reason why Comrade Wang Sunci's creation of the parallel assembly line operation method was successful is inseparable from the strong support and assistance of the leading cadres of the Basic Construction Office of the Electric Engineering Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department. The reason why the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Industrial Department promoted it better is also that the leaders at all levels can grasp this main experience in the complicated work, transfer cadres, and organize the study of this advanced experience by opening training courses and lecture meetings, and organize the implementation on the construction site. As a result, the company not only completed the original task, but also completed the additional rush task continued after August last year. Many leading comrades on the construction site, after they mastered this method, developed it further to make it richer and more substantial, so their completion of the task was particularly outstanding.

    2. Resolutely rely on the masses. The determination of the leadership must be combined with the enthusiasm of the masses in order to bring great material strength to the implementation of the parallel assembly line operation method. To realize this construction method, we must first formulate a thorough and feasible construction plan and construction instruction chart that "comes from the masses and goes to the masses." Because most of the construction projects are open-air operations and high-altitude operations, and most of them are still handicraft-style operations, the labor efficiency is uneven, and the labor force is highly variable. Therefore, before formulating the plan, the leaders must conduct in-depth investigation and research, correctly estimate the advanced and realistic nature of the quotas of various types of work, and consider the workers' construction conditions and the impact of the natural environment. After having these advanced average quotas, the construction site leaders and technicians should carefully study the drawings, familiarize themselves with the nature of the project, appropriately allocate or divide the project into sections, meticulously calculate the amount of work for each type of work, and then balance them according to various quotas, and compile the progress of each section to cooperate with the material and tool supply plan, the construction machinery operation plan, and a series of construction instruction charts such as the daily work progress of each type of work.

    Whether the construction instruction chart is advanced depends not only on whether it is organized according to the principles of parallel assembly line construction, but also on whether it organizes and promotes advanced operation methods for various types of work. When Northeast China promoted the parallel assembly line operation method last year, it did not do enough in this regard. Some leading cadres were afraid that the promotion of advanced experience would cause an imbalance and make it difficult to grasp the instruction chart. Therefore, they said: "The parallel assembly line operation method is advanced enough, and other advanced experiences can be exempted from promotion." People with this kind of thinking are because they do not fully understand that the superiority of this advanced management method lies in more planned to exert the effectiveness of various advanced operation methods, rather than restricting them. Therefore, these people are conservative and lack mass viewpoint.

    After the construction instruction chart is initially drafted, it must be submitted to all employees for discussion. Because the process of discussing the plan is actually a process of educating employees, raising mass awareness, breaking conservative thinking, and mobilizing the masses. Therefore, the construction site director, technicians, and construction personnel must go deep into the masses, patiently explain the construction instruction chart, and help the workers to formulate advanced and practical group plans to ensure the realization of the construction instruction chart.

    3. Fully prepare. When parallel assembly line operations are carried out on the construction site, the work is much more intense than in the past, and the materials, water, electricity, and construction machinery needed on the construction site every day are also more and more urgent. Therefore, it is more important to fully prepare before construction. In addition to making full preparations for materials and labor according to the plan, with the emergence of new management methods, we should further strengthen the management organization and improve the labor organization. Practice tells us that the dispatching organization should be strengthened before construction so that it becomes a highly centralized construction command agency on the construction site, and it issues orders for dispatching labor, materials, tools, etc. according to the construction instruction chart. At the same time, the dispatching organization can flexibly grasp the construction instruction chart due to changes in subjective and objective conditions, so that it is in line with reality. In addition, the material supply, labor wages, statistics, technical security and other departments on the construction site should also be strengthened in a timely manner, so as not to affect the smooth progress of construction.

    The more important preparation work is to do a detailed and thorough construction organization design. It includes construction procedures, construction methods, technical supply plans, allocation of construction management personnel, and site layout plans, etc., all of which should be fully designed before deciding to carry out parallel assembly line operations and before formulating construction plans and instruction charts. In the past, we have also done some work in this regard, but it is not complete and lacks comprehensive consideration and deployment. With the emergence of the parallel assembly line operation method, the importance of organization design in construction is increasingly highlighted. Without the site layout plan in the construction organization design, the traffic on the entire construction site will be blocked, the supply and dispatch will fail, and the progress of the entire project will be affected. Therefore, only by doing a comprehensive construction organization design work before construction can our construction site basically and completely achieve a planned, organized, and predictable stage.

    4. The responsibility system is the basis for implementing parallel assembly line operations. The parallel assembly line operation method was more widely promoted on the basis of strengthening the responsibility system movement, and the construction instruction chart actually became a concentrated expression of various specialized responsibility systems. Therefore, the realization and implementation of the parallel assembly line operation method has strengthened and consolidated the responsibility system. In the construction process, in addition to establishing a responsibility system for both parties, the construction site director, construction staff, and specialized engineers, a contact contract system must also be established.

    The purpose of the contact contract is to turn the entire construction site organization into an organic whole, strengthen the collectivity on the construction site and the initiative contact in the work. After the contact contracts are widely concluded between types of work and management departments, and between construction sites and processing plants, the mutual cooperation will be close, and many problems can be solved. The contact contract should not only stipulate the connection in progress, but also stipulate the quality requirements. In this way, not only the project quality is guaranteed, but also the progress is guaranteed, so that the project construction can be carried out smoothly.

    建筑工程施工管理的重大改革
    ——按指示图表组织平行流水作业的初步总结
    中央重工业部基本建设司
    编者按：平行流水作业法是东北建筑工程中的一项成功经验。这篇总结是中央重工业部基本建设司根据去年东北建筑工程中的经验写成的，内容比较完整、全面，可供各冬季训练班施工管理干部学习。
    随着工业建设的发展，工地上经常出现的已经不再是一幢或几幢小建筑物，而是大批的巨型建筑物，陈旧的施工管理方法越发显得不能适应新情况的要求。另一方面，国家对基本建设工作的要求又是工期愈短愈好。这样，就使我们迫切需要在施工管理上进行重大的改革，以便把各种先进的操作方法集中起来，组织起来，使之发挥最大的效能，克服过去施工管理上的落后混乱现象，不断地改变施工过程中的不平衡现象，在规模宏大的工地上进行有计划有节奏的施工。而“按指示图表组织平行流水作业”，就是唯一能满足这个要求的方法。
    平行流水作业施工法的出现与
        收获
    “按指示图表组织平行流水作业”，是在进行“三反”运动、责任制运动后出现的。去年六月，原东北工业部电工局修建一幢二九一八平方公尺三层砖木结构、混凝土楼板的宿舍。在这个工程中，王孙慈同志在苏联先进经验的启示下，在上级大力支持和技术帮助下，改进了施工方法，组织平行流水作业，使工期由一二○天缩短到六十天。并在另一幢宿舍的修建中，再把工期减到四十天。东北工业部重视了这一先进经验，及时予以总结、推广。根据不完全的统计，到去年九月底已有七十多个工程实行了这个先进施工法。东北工业部第一工程公司三十五个工地中，就有二十六个工地推行了平行流水作业法。哈尔滨工业大学二二○○○平方公尺的六层大楼，是有一千五百万块砖，三四○吨钢筋，两万七千多平方公尺的模型板，三九○立方公尺的混凝土，造型复杂的工程，按照过去的施工方法，至少需五百个技工，修建两年时间。推行了平行流水作业法，结果只用了八十多个技工，在七个月内工程即告完成。沈阳铁西工人村，共有七万五千多平方公尺的建筑面积，也由于实行同型房屋的平行流水作业施工法，在两个月内就全部竣工。事实证明，这种先进施工法比旧的施工法，一般都缩短工期三分之一到一半，使原来只能施工一次的地区，能够施工两次或三次，使许多不能完成任务的单位，完成了国家计划。
    平行流水作业施工法的出现，使现场上进行着较诸过去紧张几倍的有节奏性的劳动，从根本上消除了混乱现象。优良的劳动品质与劳动态度，在工地的管理干部与工人们的身上显著地成长着。许多干部改变了过去拖拖拉拉的作风，跳出了整日忙乱的事务主义泥坑。材料供应人员能够按照精密的供应指示图表，配合工程进度主动送料。技术管理干部也深刻体会唯有依靠群众，学习苏联的先进经验，才能有施工管理上的大翻身。工人们则由此掌握了计划，对整个建筑物的过程心中有了数，不再像过去每天上了班要等施工员分配工作再去干，而能主动地在一上班就开始自己的劳动。
    平行流水作业施工法本身有着严密的计划性与组织性，又合理地固定并使用了劳动力，组织各工种从工程施工开始到结束都能大量实行先进操作法，这就使现场上各工种从列入计划起必须一个紧跟一个地密切配合其他的工作前进；也使工人在分工明确、劳动专业化的情况下，更易于熟练与不断提高技术操作。这种施工法，迫切要求少数落后薄弱的环节必须改善旧的劳动组织、旧的操作方法乃至旧的劳动态度，为共同创造与推广先进经验开辟更广阔的道路。同时，由于群众性的质量检查制度的建立与执行，更着实改进与保证了工程质量。
    推广中的几点基本经验
    根据东北去年的情况，推广“按指示图表组织平行流水作业”的基本经验是什么呢？
    一、平行流水作业施工法能否推行与贯彻，首先决定于各级领导干部是否有坚定不移的信心，特别是工地领导干部对这个能加速祖国建设的先进经验有无足够的认识。如果领导干部熟悉业务并肯钻研业务，能支持先进与进步的东西，他就能虚心学习这个先进经验，并坚决组织或支持这个先进经验的实现。王孙慈同志创造平行流水作业法之所以能够成功，是与东北工业部电工局基本建设处领导干部大力支持与帮助分不开的。东北工业部第一工程公司推广得较好的原因，也在于各级领导干部能在纷杂的工作中抓住这个主要的经验，调集干部，用开训练班、讲习会等方法组织学习这个先进经验，并在工地上组织实行，结果，该公司不但完成了原来的任务，还完成了在去年八月份以后继续追加的突击任务。许多工地领导同志当他们掌握了这个方法之后，又加以发展，使之更丰富、更充实，所以他们完成任务的情况也就特别出色。
    二、坚决依靠群众。领导上的决心必须与群众的热情相结合，才能给贯彻平行流水作业法带来巨大的物质力量。要实现这种施工方法，首先必须制订一个“从群众中来，到群众中去”的周密的、切实可行的施工计划与施工指示图表。因为建筑工程大多是露天作业、高空作业，同时大部分还是手工业式的操作，劳动效率不均衡，劳动力的变动性很大，所以在制订计划之前，领导必须深入调查研究，正确估计各工种定额的先进性与现实性，并考虑工人的施工条件和自然环境的影响。有了这些先进平均定额后，工地领导人与技术人员应认真研究图纸，熟悉工程性质，将工程适当地分配或分段，细致地计算各工种的工程量，再根据各种定额进行平衡，编制各分段进度，以此配合材料工具供应计划、施工机械运用计划以及各工种每日工作进度等一系列的施工指示图表。
    施工指示图表是否先进，不仅决定于它是否按平行流水施工原则组织起来，同时还决定于它是否组织推广各工种的先进操作方法。去年东北推广平行流水作业法时，对于这一点，做得不够。部分领导干部怕推广了先进经验就会引起不平衡的现象，难以掌握指示图表，因此他们说：“平行流水作业法已够先进了，其他先进经验可以不用推广。”有这种想法的人是由于不完全了解这种先进管理方法的优越性，是在于更有计划地发挥各种先进操作法的效用，而不是限制它们。因此，这些人是保守的、缺乏群众观点的。
    施工指示图表初步拟定后，必须交给全体职工讨论。因为讨论计划的过程，实际上就是向职工进行教育、提高群众觉悟、打破保守思想以及发动群众的过程。所以工地主任或技术人员、施工人员等必须深入群众，耐心地讲解施工指示图表，帮助工人订出先进的切实的小组计划，以保证施工指示图表的实现。
    三、充分做好准备工作。当工地上进行平行流水作业时，工作较过去要紧张得多，工地上每天需要的材料、水电以及施工机械也更多、更迫切，因此，在开工以前充分做好准备工作就愈显得重要。除了材料与劳动力要按计划做好充分准备外，随着新的管理方法的出现，应该进一步注意加强管理机构与改善劳动组织。实践告诉我们，在施工前应特别加强调度组织，使之成为工地上具有高度集中性的施工指挥机关，由它根据施工指示图发布调度劳动力、材料工具等等命令。同时，调度组织可以因主、客观条件的变化而灵活掌握施工指示图表，使之切合实际。此外，对工地上的材料供应、劳动工资、统计、技术保安等部门，也要及时予以加强，才不会影响施工的顺利进行。
    更主要的准备工作，就是要做好详尽周密的施工组织设计。它包括施工程序、施工方法、技术供应计划、配备施工管理人员、场地的平面配置图等，这些都要在决定进行平行流水作业时于施工计划与指示图表制订前全面加以设计。过去，我们在这方面也做过一些工作，但是不够完整，缺乏全面的考虑和布置。随着平行流水作业施工法的出现，愈益显出施工中组织设计的重要性，如果没有施工组织设计中的工地平面配置图，就会使整个工地的交通阻
    塞、供应调度失灵，进而影响整个工程的进度。因
    此，只有在施工前做好了全面的施工组织设计工作，才会使我们的工地基本上完全达到有计划、有组织、有预见的地步。
    四、责任制是实行平行流水作业的基础。平行流水作业施工法，是在加强责任制运动的基础上才较普遍地推广的，而施工指示图实际上又成为各种专责制的集中表现。因此，平行流水作业施工法的实现与贯彻，又加强与巩固了责任制。在施工过程中，除必须建立甲乙双方责任制，工地主任、施工员、专责工程师的专责制等以外，还必须建立联系合同制度。
    联系合同的目的，在于将整个工地组织变为一个有机体，加强工地上的集体性及工作中的主动联系。当工种与工种间、工种与管理部门间、工地与加工厂间广泛地订立联系合同以后，互相间的配合就会密切，许多问题就能得到解决。在联系合同上不仅要规定进度上的衔接，而且要规定质量的要求，这样，不仅保证了工程质量，而且也保证了进度，使工程施工得以顺利进行。
