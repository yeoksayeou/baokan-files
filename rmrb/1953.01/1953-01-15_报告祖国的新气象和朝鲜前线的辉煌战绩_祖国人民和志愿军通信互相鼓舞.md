Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea and its local branches receive thousands of letters daily from various cities and villages addressed to the Volunteer Army soldiers. At the same time, the people of the motherland also receive countless letters from the Volunteer Army on the Korean front. These letters closely connect millions of strangers, who mutually report on the achievements of the motherland's construction work and the increasing number of victories on the front lines. These letters have become a tremendous force in encouraging combat and work morale.

The people of the motherland think of the "most beloved people" day and night, and frequently tell them about the new atmosphere of the motherland and the determination to support the front lines. Xiao Dacheng, a worker at the Shaoyang Paper Mill of the Hunan Local State-Operated Zijiang Mining and Industrial Company, excitedly wrote to the Volunteer Army, reporting that their newly built factory was about to start production. The letter said: "This factory uses all machines for production, and the output will be more than double that of the old factory. We must redouble our efforts to carry out production." Six hundred and fifty-eight model workers in industry and agriculture from Lishui County, Jiangsu Province, jointly wrote to the Volunteer Army while attending a model worker conference in the county seat, guaranteeing that they would support them with all their strength, preparing whatever the Volunteer Army needed. A Ren, a student of the Tibetan Language Internship Team of the Central Institute for Nationalities, living halfway up the 4,700-meter-high Mount Gongga in Xikang, wrote in a letter to the Volunteer Army: "We Tibetans have many things to say to you, but we cannot express them in Chinese. We have decided to reclaim more wasteland and grow more grain to support you, to express the Tibetan people's love for the Volunteer Army." Wang Zhengzhi of Baoding No. 2 Middle School wrote to Li Sigui, the "Sharp Knife" combat team in the counterattack on Jingfeng Mountain on the east bank of the North Han River, and the other soldiers of the team. The letter detailed the preferential treatment measures established by the government regarding the schooling of the children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and the grand occasion of the New Year's reception held by their school for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. One of the millions of mothers in the motherland—Huang Yiqing, who lives in Hankou—enclosed a photo of her son in a letter to the Volunteer Army, with the words "For the children of our motherland, for the children of Korea and the world, please—our dearest people—give those American aggressors who are destroying the peaceful life of mankind an even greater blow!" written on the back of the photo. She proudly told the Volunteer Army in her letter: "This child already knows how to love the Volunteer Army uncles. When he sees you in the pictorial, he kisses you. He can also sing 'Fiercely and vigorously...'." Ma Suying, a student at Fangjia Hutong Elementary School in Beijing, expressed the children's wishes in a letter to the Volunteer Army, writing: "You are fighting at the front, and we are studying in the rear. We are of one mind. What is that mind? It is the mind to strive for peace."

The Volunteer Army soldiers, busy on the tense front lines, also frequently write letters to the people of the motherland, reporting on their new achievements and their study and life situations. Soldier Ma Dejun wrote to the people of the motherland, saying: "Not only have we won big and small victories, but we have also launched a cultural learning movement. In a month and a half, I have learned 1,500 new characters. ... Severe winter has arrived, and we have already eaten the cabbage and radishes we planted ourselves." Zhao Hengzhi, a second-class combat hero of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, wrote to Zhao Lanying, a female labor model of Chongqing No. 601 Yarn Factory, reporting on their glorious achievements in fighting the American devils day and night for several days with twenty-two people, eliminating more than two hundred American devils, destroying two enemy tanks, and capturing many spoils of war. He wrote: "Our ability to achieve this victory is inseparable from the active production of the worker brothers in the rear to support the front lines."

The letters written by the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army become a force to encourage fighting spirit after arriving at the front lines. A certain anti-aircraft artillery company of the Volunteer Army responded to the members of the first group of the Communist Youth League of the senior three class of the Affiliated Women's Middle School of Beijing Normal University with the achievement of hitting and shooting down twenty-five enemy planes. Volunteer soldier Yang Guorun replied to the people of the motherland, saying: "We have received the letters of condolences and the comfort items from the people of the motherland. We will firmly remember the instructions of the people of the motherland and shoot bullets and shells more accurately at the American aggressors. We will never stop shooting until peace is in hand." Soldier Zhang Yude, after receiving the letters from the children of the Beijing Film Studio Nursery, replied: "When we know that your lives are so happy, we think that we have to work harder to beat the American aggressors even harder and more miserably." The letters written by the Volunteer Army to the people of the motherland have also greatly enhanced people's confidence and determination to build the motherland. After the Liu Changfu team of Tianjin Steel Plant received a letter from the Volunteer Army, the production volume increased by 40%. Gu Tonglin, a student at Nanyang Advanced Vocational School in Henan, carries the letter from the Volunteer Army soldier with him, saying: "Whenever I encounter difficulties in my studies, as long as I look at the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army, I can increase my courage and strength."

    报告祖国的新气象和朝鲜前线的辉煌战绩
    祖国人民和志愿军通信互相鼓舞
    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会和各地分会，每天都收到从各个城镇、乡村寄来的给志愿军战士的上千封信。同时，祖国人民也接到朝鲜前线志愿军的无数来信。书信把千千万万素不相识的人紧紧地联在一起，他们相互报告祖国建设工作的成就和前线越来越多的胜利消息。这些信件，成了鼓舞战斗和工作情绪的巨大力量。
    祖国人民日日夜夜惦记着“最可爱的人”，经常把祖国的新的气象和支援前线的决心告诉他们。湖南地方国营资江工矿公司邵阳造纸厂的工人萧大成兴奋地写信给志愿军，报告他们新建的工厂就要开工了。信上说：“这个厂子全部用机器生产，产量将比旧厂子增加两倍多，我们一定要加倍努力来进行生产。”江苏省溧水县六百五十八位工、农业劳动模范在县城参加劳动模范会议时，联名写信给志愿军，保证要以全力支援他们，志愿军需要什么，就准备什么。住在拔海四千七百公尺的西康贡噶山半山腰的中央民族学院藏语实习队学员阿仁在写给志愿军的信上说：“我们藏民有许多话要对你们说，就是不能用汉文表达出来。我们决定多开荒、多打粮，支援你们，来表达藏民热爱志愿军的心意。”保定市第二中学校王正之写信给北汉江东岸井峰山反击战中的“尖刀”战斗组李四贵和该组的其他战士。信上详细叙述了政府订立的关于革命烈士、革命军人子女求学的优待办法和他们学校在新年举行招待革命烈士家属和革命军人家属晚会的盛况。祖国千千万万母亲中的一个——住在汉口的黄亦青在寄给志愿军的信内附寄着她儿子的一张相片，相片背面写着：“为了我们祖国的孩子，为了朝鲜和全世界的孩子，请你们——我们最亲爱的人，给那些破坏人类和平生活的美国侵略者更大的打击！”她在信上骄傲地告诉志愿军说：“这孩子已经知道爱志愿军叔叔了。他在画报上看见你们，就吻你们。他还会唱‘雄赳赳，气昂昂……。’”北京市方家胡同小学学生马素英在写给志愿军的信中表达了孩子们的愿望，她写道：“你们在前方打仗，我们在后方学习，咱们是一条心。是什么心呢？就是争取和平的心。”
    志愿军战士们在紧张繁忙的前线，也经常写信给祖国的人民，报告他们新的战绩和学习、生活的情况。战士马德俊写信告诉祖国人民说：“我们不但打了大大小小的胜仗，我们还开展了学习文化的运动，我在一个半月中，学会了一千五百个生字。……严冬到来了，我们已吃上了自己栽种的白菜和萝卜。”志愿军某部二级战斗英雄赵恒志写信给重庆六○一纱厂女劳动模范赵兰英，报告他们二十二个人不分昼夜和美国鬼子打了好几天，消灭了美国鬼子二百多人，打毁敌人两辆坦克，还缴获了很多胜利品的辉煌战绩。他写道：“我们能获得这个胜利，是和工人兄弟在后方积极生产支援前线分不开的。”
    祖国人民给志愿军写的信到达前线后，变成了鼓舞斗志的力量。志愿军某部高射炮连以击伤、击落敌机二十五架的战绩，来回答北京师范大学附属女子中学高三一班青年团第一小组的团员们。志愿军战士杨国润复信给祖国人民说：“我们已收到了祖国人民的慰问信和慰劳品。我们坚决记住祖国人民的叮咛，更准确地把子弹和炮弹打到美国侵略者的身上。和平不到手，我们决不停止射击。”战士张育德在收到北京电影制片厂托儿所小朋友们的信后，回信说：“当我们知道你们的生活是那样幸福，我们就想到还要加把劲，把美国侵略者打得更重更惨一些。”志愿军写给祖国人民的信，也大大增强了人们建设祖国的信心和决心。天津钢铁厂刘长福小组当接到志愿军的来信后，生产量就提高了百分之四十。河南南阳高级职业学校学生顾同林把志愿军战士的来信随身带着，他说：“当我学习碰到困难时，只要看一看志愿军们的英勇事例，就能给自己增加勇气和力量。”
