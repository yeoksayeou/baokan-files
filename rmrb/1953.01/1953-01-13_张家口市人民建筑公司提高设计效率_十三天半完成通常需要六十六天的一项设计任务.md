    Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Construction Company Improves Design Efficiency
    Completing a Design Task That Normally Takes Sixty-Six Days in Thirteen and a Half Days

    In designing the Zhangjiakou Tannery construction project, the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Construction Company completed a design task that normally takes sixty-six days in thirteen and a half days.

    The main experiences of the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Construction Company in improving design efficiency are: (1) Implementing a specialized division of labor, dividing the entire tannery project into categories such as factory buildings, office buildings, auditoriums, warehouses, miscellaneous projects, dormitories, and factory auxiliary equipment. Based on the project category, all design personnel were divided into four specialized groups, with each group responsible for one type of project or several projects of similar nature. Manpower was allocated according to the tasks undertaken, changing the previous situation of randomly assigning tasks and wasting manpower and resources. For example, a large portion of the twenty-two factory buildings in the tannery had similar styles and structures. After assigning them to one specialized group for design, the efficiency increased by more than twofold. Each specialized group then assigned specific tasks based on each person's expertise, such as some specializing in architectural drawing design, others specializing in structural design, and implementing assembly line operations. This ensured a clear division of labor, leveraging expertise, and close coordination, so that each design task started with drawing design, passed through structural design to budgeting, one after the other, connecting seamlessly, and avoiding waiting and idle work in the middle. (2) On the basis of specialized division of labor, rationally using design resources. They concentrated skilled designers on the most important links, and assigned some technically less demanding work, such as the design of dining halls, dormitories, and carports, to general technicians and interns with lower technical levels. The simple calculation part of the budget was assigned to accounting personnel. Even on some major projects, they tried to use technicians as much as possible. For example, when designing the drying room, the engineer created the plan layout and structural drawings for the main parts, and then guided the technician to supplement and complete them, reducing the engineer's work by about 30 percent. This greatly enhanced the potential capabilities of the design personnel. (3) Implementing chart management. In accordance with the spirit of "organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts," they formulated a "design progress indicator chart" to concretize the pre-determined design progress plan and express it in charts to guide the entire work. This enabled the leadership to foresee the progress of the entire work every day, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and ensure the early completion of the tannery design task.

    张家口市人民建筑公司提高设计效率
    十三天半完成通常需要六十六天的一项设计任务
    张家口市人民建筑公司在进行张家口制皮厂建筑工程的设计中，以十三天半时间，完成了通常需要六十六天才能完成的设计任务。
    张家口市人民建筑公司提高设计效率的主要经验是：（一）实行专业分工，把制皮厂整个工程分为厂房、办公楼、礼堂、仓库、杂项工程、宿舍和厂房附属设备等类，根据工程类别，再把所有设计人员分成四个专业小组，每组担任一种工程或性质相近的几种工程，根据所负担的任务配备人力，改变了过去随便分配任务，浪费人力物力的情况。如制皮厂的二十二幢厂房中，有大部分的样式和结构相近似，交由一个专业小组来设计以后，效率就提高了两倍以上。每个专业小组又根据各人的专长分配他们专一的任务，如有的专门负责建筑图样设计，有的专门负责结构设计，并实行了流水作业。这样就能做到分工明确，发挥专长，并且互相紧密配合，使每一个设计任务先从图样设计开始，经过结构设计到预算，一个紧接一个，互相衔接，避免了中途发生等待和窝工的现象。（二）在专业分工的基础上，合理使用设计力量。他们把熟练的设计人员集中使用到最重要的环节上去，把一些技术性较低的工作，如饭厅、宿舍、汽车棚等的设计工作，交给一般技术员、练习生等技术水准较低的人员去做。把预算的单纯计算部分交给会计人员去做。就是在一些主要工程上，也尽量使用技术员，如在设计干燥间时，工程师做出平面布置图和结构图等主要部分后，就指导技术员去补充完成，减少了工程师约百分之三十的工作。这样就大大发挥了设计人员的潜在能力。（三）实行图表管理。他们根据“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的精神，制定了“设计进度指示图”，把事先订出的设计进度计划具体化，以图表表现出来，指导整个工作的进行。这样就使领导方面能每天预见到整个工作的进度，及时发现和解决问题，保证了制皮厂设计任务提前完成。
