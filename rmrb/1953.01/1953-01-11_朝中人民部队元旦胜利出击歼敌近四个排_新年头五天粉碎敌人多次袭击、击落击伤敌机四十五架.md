Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 10th: While celebrating the New Year, the Korean-Chinese People's Army fought several outstanding small battles on the snow-covered Korean front.

    On New Year's Day, before dawn, our army annihilated an entire platoon and most of three platoons of the Li pseudo-army in two surprise attacks. The first battle took place at 0:05 a.m. Our army, guarding the main peak of the mountain ridge to the left of Shangganling, sent a small unit to attack an enemy position in the northeast corner. The soldiers deftly approached the enemy, captured the enemy sentries, and then immediately destroyed seven enemy bunkers, eliminating a platoon of the Li pseudo-army, totaling more than 40 men. The second battle took place at 1:00 a.m. A 22-man assault team from our army on the eastern front crept up to Height 854.1 east of Changchengli to attack the enemy. The defending enemy on this height consisted of two infantry platoons and one artillery platoon from the 51st Regiment of the Li pseudo-army. Although the enemy outnumbered our assault team by far, they could not withstand the sudden and fierce attack. The fierce battle lasted for an hour, and except for a few enemies who managed to escape, the rest were annihilated by our army. The ratio of our army's casualties to the enemy's was 1:130.

    On the night of the 5th, our army attacked enemy positions southwest of Shangganling and southwest of Lianchuan, eliminating a platoon and a squad of defending enemies in total.

    In the first five days of the New Year, the enemy launched more than ten attacks on our army's positions. However, in each battle, the enemy abandoned their wounded, corpses, and weapons and ammunition and fled in panic. One night, the 8th Division of the Li pseudo-army sent more than 30 men to attack a guard post of our army near Laishoudong, southeast of Jincheng. After our army discovered this, it immediately sent a small unit to the enemy's flanks to carry out a pincer attack, eliminating 20 enemies and seizing 20 automatic rifles and other weapons. In the area southeast of Daomudong, west of Gaolangpuli on the western front, our army also repelled a harassment by more than 200 enemies supported by ten tanks late at night on the 1st, killing or wounding 48 enemies and seizing one light and heavy machine gun each, two flamethrowers, and eight automatic rifles.

    In these five days, our army's front-line anti-aircraft weapons units shot down a total of 20 enemy aircraft and damaged 25 enemy aircraft.

    朝中人民部队元旦胜利出击歼敌近四个排
    新年头五天粉碎敌人多次袭击、击落击伤敌机四十五架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】在欢度新年的时候，朝中人民军队在满铺白雪的朝鲜前线打了好几个出色的小战斗。
    元旦那天天明之前，我军在两次袭击战中，歼灭李伪军一个排全部和三个排大部。第一次战斗发生在半夜零时五分，守卫在上甘岭左边山岭主峰上的我军，派出一支小部队袭击东北角的一个敌人阵地。战士们敏捷地摸到敌人跟前，将敌人的哨兵捉住，然后马上将敌人的七个地堡炸毁，消灭李伪军一个排，计四十多人。第二次战斗发生在半夜一时，东线我军二十二人的一支袭击队，摸到长承里以东八五四点一高地上去袭击敌人。这个高地上的守敌是李伪军五十一团的两个步兵排和一个火器排。虽然敌人的人数比我军的这支袭击队多得多，可是他们经不起突然的、猛烈的打击。这场激战进行了一个小时，除了几个敌人侥幸逃脱外，其余的敌人都被我军歼灭了。我军和敌人伤亡的比例是一比一百三十。
    五日夜里，我军袭击上甘岭西南和涟川西南两处敌军阵地，共计歼灭守敌一个排又一个班。
    在新年的头五天中，敌人向我军阵地袭击十多次。但是每次战斗结果，敌人都是丢下伤兵、尸首和枪枝弹药亡命逃回。一日夜里，李伪军第八师派出三十多人前来袭击金城东南来首洞附近我军的一个警戒阵地。我军发觉后，立即派出一支小部队插到敌人的侧后去实行两面夹击，歼敌二十名，缴获自动步枪等二十支。在西线高浪浦里以西道幕洞东南地区，我军也于一日深夜击退有十辆坦克配合的二百多名敌人的袭扰，杀伤敌人四十八名，缴获轻重机枪各一挺，火焰喷射器二具，自动步枪八支。
    在这五天中，我军前线的高射武器部队共计击落敌机二十架，击伤敌机二十五架。
