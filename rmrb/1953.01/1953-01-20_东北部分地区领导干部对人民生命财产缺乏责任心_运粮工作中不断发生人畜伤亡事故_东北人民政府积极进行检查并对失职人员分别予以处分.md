In the grain storage work in Northeast China in 1952, due to a lack of attention to the Northeast People's Government's instructions on "no human or animal casualties allowed," from late November to mid-December 1952, more than 200 human and animal casualty accidents occurred in the region, resulting in 31 deaths, 146 injuries, 80 livestock deaths, and 35 damaged carts. Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces were the most severely affected, with more than 50 human and animal casualty accidents each. Other areas such as Liaoxi, Rehe, Shenyang, and Benxi also experienced continuous accidents.

The reasons for human and animal casualties in the grain storage work in some areas of Northeast China are: some cadres lack the necessary sense of responsibility for the lives and property of the people, believing that human and animal casualties are inevitable in grain transportation, and are therefore negligent. For example, when the Yongji County People's Government in Jilin Province held an emergency meeting after human and animal casualties occurred, the head of the Sixth District of the county actually said: "Last year (1951), Yongji County had 49 human and animal casualties and no meeting was held, but this year (1952) there were only nine and a meeting is being held." A cultural and educational assistant in the Fourteenth District of Yushu County, after hearing the report of human and animal casualties in the district, thought: "This year (1952) is not bad, only one accident occurred." Some county and district cadres have serious bureaucratism. For example, the Sixth District of Yongji County kept the superior's instructions on grain transportation piled up in a pile of documents for more than 20 days, and only found them when asked. The county head of Nongan County in Jilin Province blamed the head of the county finance and grain section for not telling him earlier after continuous human and animal casualties occurred in the county. Secondly, some areas lack specific plans for organizing grain storage work, and there is no one specifically responsible. For example, when the Wangqing County in Yanbian Autonomous Region held a people's representative meeting to arrange for the transport of public grain, Jin Meiyu, a cadre from Jinyang Village in the county, participated, but after the meeting, Jin Meiyu was transferred to study without conveying the information to the village; the cadre from Zhanghan Village who participated in the meeting to arrange for public grain transport was sent to participate in the labor model meeting at the district government without conveying the information after returning to the village, forming a phenomenon in which the instructions of the higher-level government were only general calls, lacking specific organization, and the instructions could not be deeply implemented into the grassroots organizations, and no one was responsible for grain transport work. In the grain transport work, there was a lack of inspection of the people and animals transporting grain, and the elderly and children also participated in grain transport and driving carts; timid and easily frightened livestock were also used to transport grain; no one was stationed at dangerous road crossings to direct traffic; damaged roads and bridges were not repaired; and cart drivers showed off and rushed to grab carts, resulting in continuous human and animal casualties.

The Ministry of Finance of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast People's Supervisory Committee have jointly conducted inspections and handled the above-mentioned incidents with the relevant provincial people's governments. For Yongji County, Jilin Province, where the accidents were more serious, the county head was exempted from punishment because he was away on official business before the accident and held meetings late into the night to discuss remedial measures afterward. The head of the Sixth District of the county was dismissed for being negligent and irresponsible in grain transportation, and the district finance and grain assistant was given a demerit; other cadres were also dealt with according to the severity of their circumstances. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government attached great importance to the human and animal casualty accidents in the province. In addition to conducting self-criticism to improve leadership, the provincial chairman also requested punishment from the Northeast People's Government. Other areas where incidents occurred also learned their lesson and proposed improvement measures.

According to the experience gained by the Ministry of Finance of the Northeast People's Government from inspections in various places, the importance attached to grain transportation work by leadership at all levels and the strengthening of the organization and inspection of grain transportation work are important keys to avoiding human and animal casualties. The Third District of Dunhua County, Jilin Province, has not had any human or animal casualties in grain transportation work since 1949. This is because their transportation organization is sound, with fixed districts as brigades, villages as middle teams, and hamlets as small teams; cattle, horses, and rubber-tired carts are organized into teams separately, achieving "people and hearts united, vehicles and harnesses matched"; the captain and deputy captain wear sleeve badges, the vehicles are numbered, small flags are inserted, the cart drivers wear numbered badges, and the vehicles travel in order. Each team also sets up covenants to abide by order, travel and return together, the whole team helps each other if one vehicle has trouble; team members do not rush to grab carts, do not lag behind, do not drink alcohol, do not privately carry other things, and do not sleep on the carts. Loading is planned, with different grades of grain loaded separately to facilitate storage; militiamen are responsible for maintaining order and checking whether the convoys are qualified at dangerous road crossings. Due to the soundness of the grassroots grain transportation organization, it has been guaranteed that no human or animal casualties have occurred in the district for three years. This experience should be promoted in a timely manner.

### 东北部分地区领导干部对人民生命财产缺乏责任心  运粮工作中不断发生人畜伤亡事故  东北人民政府积极进行检查并对失职人员分别予以处分

    东北部分地区领导干部对人民生命财产缺乏责任心
    运粮工作中不断发生人畜伤亡事故
    东北人民政府积极进行检查并对失职人员分别予以处分
    东北部分地区在一九五二年运粮入库工作中，由于不重视执行东北人民政府关于“不准发生人畜伤亡事故”的指示，从一九五二年十一月下旬开始，至十二月中旬止，全区相继发生人畜伤亡事故共达二百余起，死三十一人，伤一百四十六人；死伤牲畜八十头，损坏大车三十五辆。其中以吉林省、黑龙江省为最严重，各发生人畜伤亡事故达五十余件。其他如辽西、热河、沈阳、本溪等地亦不断发生事故。
    东北部分地区在运粮入库工作中所以造成人畜伤亡事故的原因是：有些干部对人民生命财产缺乏应有的责任心，认为运粮当中人畜伤亡不可避免，因而麻痹大意。如吉林省永吉县人民政府在发生人畜伤亡事故后召开紧急会议时，该县第六区区长竟说：“去年（一九五一年）永吉县发生人畜伤亡事故四十九件都没有开会，今年（一九五二年）才发生九件倒开会了。”榆树县十四区文教助理员在听到该区发生人畜伤亡事故报告后认为：“今年（一九五二年）不错，才发生一次”。某些县、区干部有严重的官僚主义。如永吉县六区将上级有关运粮的指示压在文件堆里二十余天，到查问时才找出来。吉林省农安县县长在该县连续发生人畜伤亡事故后，反怪县财粮科长为什么不早对他说。其次，有些地区，对组织运粮入库工作缺乏具体计划，更无专人负责。如延边自治区汪清县在召开人民代表会布置公粮运输工作时，该县金阳村派干部金梅玉参加，但会后金梅玉回村没有传达即又被抽调参加学习去了；章翰村参加布置公粮运输工作会议的干部回村后也没有传达就又到区政府参加劳动模范会去了，形成上级政府的指示只有一般号召，缺乏具体组织的现象，指示不能深入贯彻到基层组织，运粮工作无人负责。在运粮工作中对运粮的人畜缺乏检查，老头、小孩也参加运粮赶车，胆小好惊的牲口也套车送粮；险要道口没有人站岗指挥；损坏了的道路桥梁没有加以修理；赶车人逞强抢车，致人畜伤亡事故不断发生。
    东北人民政府财政部和东北人民监察委员会已与有关各省人民政府对上述事件联合进行检查与处理。对发生事故较严重的吉林省永吉县，因县长事前因公外出，事后又星夜开会讨论补救措施，免于处分，该县第六区区长在运粮中麻痹大意，不负责任，予以撤职处分；并予该区财粮助理员以记过处分；其余干部亦都分别按情节轻重予以处理。黑龙江省人民政府对该省发生的人畜伤亡事故十分重视，省主席除进行检讨改进领导外，同时还向东北人民政府自请处分。其他肇事地区亦接受教训，提出改进办法。
    根据东北人民政府财政部在各地检查所得的经验证明，各级领导机关对运粮工作的重视，加强对运粮工作的组织和检查，是避免人畜伤亡的重要关键。吉林省敦化县第三区从一九四九年以来，运粮工作中一直没有发生人畜伤亡事故。这是因为他们的运输组织健全，固定区为大队，村为中队，屯为小队；牛、马、胶皮车则分别编队，作到了“人合心，车合套”；正副队长袖带符号，车排号，插小旗，赶车人带佩号次，依次行车。各队并定公约，遵守秩序，同行同归，一车有事，全队互助；队员不抢车，不落后，不喝酒，不私自捎带别的东西，不在车上睡觉。装车作到有计划，分别粮种等级装车，以使入库便利；民兵负责在险要道口站岗维持秩序及检查车队是否合格。由于基层运粮组织的健全，保证了该区三年来未发生人畜伤亡事故。这一经验应及时推广。
