Leading Cadres Exhibit Dependence and Waiting Mentality
Chongqing 507 Factory Construction Preparation Work Proceeds Very Slowly

    The design for the capital construction project of the state-owned Chongqing 507 Factory was completed in July of last year, but the construction preparation work has made no headway to this day. Construction forces have not been prepared early enough. The number of existing technical cadres accounts for only 18 percent of the actual need, administrative cadres only 16 percent, and construction workers and mechanical workers only 12 percent. Moreover, even these existing people have not been well organized. They are mostly put together temporarily to cope with a certain project. In terms of materials, there has also been no early preparation. Now, steel is lacking by 20 percent, there is no cement at all, and bricks are short by 1.3 million. Most of these materials are allocated by the state, but because procurement plans were not submitted early enough, production departments cannot guarantee timely supply, and they cannot be bought on the market either. Even the materials that have been purchased suffer a lot of damage during transportation because there is no one specifically responsible for supervision and inspection. Construction machinery has also not been prepared, such as stone crushers, cement mixers, vibrators, cranes, and flatcars. Many of them have not yet been transported to the construction site. The construction site must have water, but there was no water supply equipment in the past. Two small water pumps were installed at the end of December of last year, barely enough to meet the needs. After the factory building starts construction, the amount of water needed for pouring concrete will be enormous, but this problem was not considered early enough, and now other factories have been commissioned to rush to manufacture large water pumps to solve it. Electricity was also not prepared early. Now, only one-third of the required power can be supplied. To erect a dedicated line to solve this problem, copper wire, transformers, and utility poles have not been prepared, so the rock drill has to be powered by steam. Most of the material warehouses were not prepared in advance. When the machines and materials arrived, they had to be piled in the open air. Some machines have rusted, and no one cares about them, leaving them to their fate. Preparation work for transportation has also not been done well. The dormitory road is only 60 percent complete, and only 5 percent of the roads inside the factory have been repaired. The railway was contracted to the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau for construction, but the bureau passed it on to the Chongqing Railway Branch Bureau, and they pushed it back and forth. Construction has not started to this day, which greatly affects the transportation work during construction. The construction of the factory was designed by Soviet experts, but the factory has very poor organization for the safekeeping, sorting, translation, duplication, and study of foreign language drawings. As a result, some of the drawings are already disorganized. In addition, translators were not prepared early enough, and translation is not timely. They are found and used as needed, making it impossible for leading cadres to understand the overall situation, and the work is passive everywhere. For example, when the factory building was about to start construction, it was discovered that the lighting route map had not been translated. The tie beams of the foundation only show the concrete pouring dimensions on the drawings and do not show the steel bars, which affects the progress of the project. In addition, employee dormitories, medical and health equipment, etc., have not been prepared.

    There are two main reasons why the factory's construction preparation work has been so poor. One is that leading cadres and technical personnel all have a mentality of dependence, only wanting to "wait until the Soviet experts come and then talk about it," and they dare not take the initiative in everything, big or small. For example, the plane layout map for water sources, power sources, temporary construction site warehouses, sheds, earth and stone works before construction had already been made, and preparations could have been started, but they still hoped for a technical design (in fact, this temporary construction would not be included in the technical design), so they waited until mid-October to start preparing after the design was completed in July. For example, they also dare not prepare building materials such as river sand, gravel, cement, and steel bars because they do not have clear specifications. In fact, these materials can be calculated based on the technical design. It is precisely because the factory's leading cadres have this kind of dependence and waiting mentality that they are passive everywhere and cannot keep up step by step. The second reason why the factory's construction preparation work has not been done well is the lack of a sound responsibility system and a scientific work system in the work. There is a lack of communication between the various departments, and the work is pushed back and forth. The civil engineering department does not know the procurement situation of the supply department, and the supply department cannot figure out the bottom line of the manager's office. The work assigned by the higher authorities cannot be guaranteed to be implemented institutionally, and the situation below cannot be reflected in a timely manner. Administrative management and technical management work such as material supply, technical guidance, and analysis and research of drawings cannot adapt to the requirements of on-site construction.

    The construction of the 507 Factory is one of the key construction projects in the country. The above-mentioned serious situation cannot be allowed to continue. The leading cadres of the factory should quickly take effective measures to change it.

    领导干部存在依赖等待思想
    重庆五○七厂施工准备工作进行很慢
    国营重庆五○七厂基本建设工程的设计在去年七月就做好了，但施工的准备工作到现在还没有头绪。施工力量没有及早准备，现有的技术干部人数只占实际需要的百分之十八，行政干部只占百分之十六，建筑工人和机械工人只占百分之十二。而且就是现有的这些人，也还没有很好地组织起来，多是在进行某项工程时，才临时凑起一帮人来应付。在材料方面也没有及早准备，现在钢料缺少百分之二十，水泥一点也没有，砖差一百三十万块。这些材料大都是靠国家统一调拨的，但由于没有及早提出采购计划，使得生产部门无法保证及时供应，市场上也无法买到。已经买到的材料，也因没有专人负责监督检查，在运输时，沿途损耗很多。施工机械也没有准备好，如碎石机、水泥搅拌机、震动机、吊车、平车等，有许多到现在还没有运到工地。工地必须用水，但过去没有供水设备，去年十二月底才装了两个小水泵，勉强敷用。厂房开工后，浇灌混凝土所需水量极大，但对这个问题也没有及早考虑，到现在才委托别的工厂赶制大水泵来解决。用电也没有早作准备，现在只能供给需电力的三分之一弱。要架设专线解决这一问题，又没有准备好铜线、变压器和电线杆，以致开山机只好用蒸气来发动。材料库也是绝大部分没有在事前做好，等到机器、材料来了，只好堆在露天地里。有些机器已生了锈，也没有人过问，听之任之。交通方面的准备工作也没做好。宿舍公路才完成百分之六十，厂内公路只修了百分之五。铁路包给西南铁路工程局修筑后，该局又推给重庆铁路分局，互相推诿，到现在还没有动工，大大影响了施工中的运输工作。该厂的建设是聘请苏联专家设计的，但该厂对于外文图纸的保管、整理、翻译、复制和学习、研究等工作都组织得很差，以致图纸已有部分零乱，再加上翻译人员没有及早准备好，翻译不及时，随用随找，使领导干部无法了解全面情况，工作处处陷于被动。例如厂房准备施工了，才发现照明路线图没有译出来；基础的拉梁在图纸上只看出混凝土浇注尺寸，看不出钢筋，影响工程进度。此外，对职工宿舍、医药卫生设备等，也都没有准备好。
    该厂的施工准备工作做得这样差，主要原因有两个。一个是领导干部和技术人员都存在着依赖思想，只想“等苏联专家来了再说”，事无大小，处处不敢主动。如施工前的水源、电源、临时工地仓库、场棚、土石方等，已有了平面布置图，本来可以着手准备，但他们仍希望有技术设计（实际上这种临时性建筑不会包括在技术设计内），以致七月里完成了设计，直等到十月半才动手准备。又如河沙、石子、水泥、钢筋等建筑材料，他们也因没有明晰的规格而不敢准备，实际上这些材料是可以根据技术设计计算出来的。正由于该厂领导干部存在着这种依赖、等待思想，因而弄得处处被动，步步跟不上。该厂施工准备工作做得不好的第二个原因是工作中缺乏健全的责任制度与科学的工作制度。各科之间缺乏联系，工作互相推诿，土木科不知道供应科的采购情况，供应科又摸不清经理处的底。上级布置的工作不能从制度上保证贯彻，下面情况也不能及时反映上来。材料供应、技术指导、图纸的分析研究等行政管理与技术管理工作，都不能适应现场施工的要求。
    五○七厂的建设是全国重点建设工程之一，上述的严重情况是不能容许继续存在的，该厂的领导干部应该迅速采取有效措施，加以改变。
