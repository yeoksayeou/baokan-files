    The State Administration Council of the Central People's Government

    Decision on Several Amendments to the Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China

    (Passed at the 165th meeting of the State Administration Council on January 2, 1953)

    The Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China were promulgated by this Council in February 1951. Some achievements and experiences have been gained in their implementation. They have been supported by the broad masses of workers and staff and have played a positive role in alleviating the difficulties in the lives of workers and staff and in inspiring their enthusiasm for labor. However, the Labor Insurance Regulations were formulated under the circumstances that the national financial and economic situation had not yet been fully restored. Some of the treatment provisions were set at a relatively low level, and the scope of implementation could only adopt the method of key pilot projects. Now that the national financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved, and large-scale economic construction work is about to begin, it is appropriate to appropriately expand the scope of implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations and moderately raise the treatment standards. However, since the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is still ongoing, and a large amount of funds needs to be invested in economic construction, the state must first use its financial resources for the main undertakings that relate to the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. At the same time, the welfare of the working class and all the people can only be gradually improved on the basis of production development. Therefore, the scope of implementation of the current Labor Insurance Regulations cannot be expanded too widely, and the treatment standards cannot be raised too high. To this end, this Council hereby makes the following decisions:

    1.  Regarding the expansion of the scope of implementation, in addition to the railways, postal and telecommunications, shipping, and factories and mines with more than 100 employees that have already been implemented, the scope of implementation is now expanded to the following enterprises: (1) Basic construction units of factories, mines, and transportation undertakings; (2) State-owned construction companies. In the units within the expanded scope, the labor insurance premiums shall generally be paid by the administrative side from January 1, 1953, and the workers and staff shall enjoy the various labor insurance benefits stipulated in the Labor Insurance Regulations from March 1, 1953.

    For enterprise units within the expanded scope, the administrative side of the enterprise shall, in conjunction with the grassroots trade union organizations, formulate implementation measures and apply to the local labor administrative authorities for review and implementation. If there are special difficulties and it is temporarily difficult to implement, it may be postponed with the approval of the local labor administrative authorities.

    2.  Regarding the improvement of labor insurance benefits, the provision that medical treatment for work stoppage is limited to six months is abolished, the standard of treatment during the period of illness of workers and staff is appropriately increased, the appropriate subsidy for expensive medicines is stipulated, the old-age subsidy is increased, the old-age conditions are relaxed, and other items such as maternity benefits, funeral expenses, funeral subsidies, and family relief expenses for non-work-related deaths are also appropriately increased. The above standards are specifically stipulated in the revised Labor Insurance Regulations. All enterprises that have implemented the Labor Insurance Regulations shall pay the various labor insurance expenses due to workers and staff in accordance with the new regulations from January 1, 1953.

    3.  The Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government shall, in conjunction with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, promptly revise the draft implementing rules of the revised Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China and other relevant laws and regulations and promulgate them.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于中华人民共和国劳动保险条例若干修正的决定
    （一九五三年一月二日政务院第一百六十五次政务会议通过）
    一九五一年二月本院颁布了中华人民共和国劳动保险条例，在实行中已取得了一些成绩和经验，获得了广大职工群众的拥护，对于减轻职工生活中的困难，鼓舞职工的劳动热情，都起了积极的作用。但劳动保险条例是在国家财政经济还没有全面恢复情况下制定的，有些待遇规定得较低，在实施范围上也只能采取重点试行办法。现在国家财政经济状况已经根本好转，大规模经济建设工作即将展开，自应适当扩大劳动保险条例实施范围并酌量提高待遇标准，但由于抗美援朝的斗争仍在继续进行，经济建设又需投入大量资金，国家必须将财力首先用之于关系全国人民根本利益的主要事业，同时工人阶级和全体人民的福利也只有在生产发展的基础上才能逐步改进。因此目前劳动保险条例的实施范围还不能扩大得过广，待遇标准也不能提得过高。为此，本院特作下列决定：
    一、关于扩大实施范围问题，除原已施行的铁路、邮电、航运及有职工一百人以上的工厂、矿场外，现将实施范围扩大到下列各项企业：（一）工厂、矿场及交通事业的基本建设单位；（二）国营建筑公司。在扩大范围内的单位一般应自一九五三年一月一日起由其行政方面缴纳劳动保险金，工人职员从一九五三年三月一日起，享受劳动保险条例所规定的各项劳动保险待遇。
    凡属于扩大范围内的企业单位，应由企业行政方面会同工会基层组织拟定实施办法，向当地劳动行政机关申请审核实行。如因有特殊困难，暂时难于实行者，经当地劳动行政机关批准后亦可暂缓实行。
    二、关于提高劳动保险待遇问题，废止停工医疗以六个月为限的规定，适当提高职工疾病医疗期间待遇标准，规定贵重药费的酌情补助，增加养老补助费，放宽养老条件，其他如生育待遇、丧葬费、丧葬补助费、非因工死亡家属救济费亦酌量增加。上述各项标准已在修改后的劳动保险条例中具体规定。凡已实行劳动保险条例的企业应自一九五三年一月一日起按照新规定支付工人职员应得的各项劳动保险费。
    三、中央人民政府劳动部应会同中华全国总工会根据修正后的中华人民共和国劳动保险条例从速修改劳动保险条例实施细则草案及其他有关法令并公布之。
