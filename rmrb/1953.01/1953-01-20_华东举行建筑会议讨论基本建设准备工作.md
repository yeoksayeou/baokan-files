East China Financial and Economic Committee and the East China Construction Engineering Bureau convened the first East China Construction Conference from January 6th to 12th in order to rapidly complete the preparatory work for basic construction in the East China region in 1953. More than 100 leading figures from construction engineering departments and trade unions in various provinces and cities in East China attended.

This conference resolved the following issues: First, based on the existing construction strength in East China, a preliminary ranking of construction tasks was carried out. This allows the East China Construction Engineering Bureau to more confidently and promptly formulate this year's work plan and submit it to the central government for approval. Representatives from construction engineering departments in various provinces and cities can also return with a clear understanding to make necessary preparations for design and construction. Second, the conference centralized and exchanged information on the organizational situation of design and construction forces and winter training experiences in various provinces and cities, preventing possible conservative thinking and impetuous emotions in this regard, and developing construction forces in a more planned and step-by-step manner. For example, regarding the issue of fixed workers, it was clarified that the target of fixing should be skilled workers; and in terms of expanding the construction workforce, the bias of some regions in taking over unemployed workers was also corrected. Third, by comparing construction tasks with construction strength, construction departments in various provinces and cities formulated investment figures for basic construction in their respective departments based on their own needs, and these were determined after consultation and discussion. Fourth, the conference studied the situation where the construction strength in the East China region lags far behind the construction tasks. Everyone clearly recognized that it is necessary to focus on national defense and heavy industry construction to ensure the completion of the most important projects.

In order to better complete the preparatory work for basic construction this year and resolve the contradiction between the small construction force and the large tasks, the conference put forward the following suggestions and requirements as goals for future efforts: First, in order to achieve great victories on both the front lines of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and economic construction, leaders of construction departments must establish an overall concept and a concept of focusing on key projects, first ensuring the completion of important national defense construction and economic construction projects related to the overall situation, and then striving to complete more tasks. At the same time, when undertaking tasks, they must obey the unified planning of the central government. Even if they have previously agreed to undertake local construction tasks, if they later conflict with the tasks required by the central government, they should weigh the priorities and first obey the central government and the overall interests. Second, the plan compiled at this conference is still rough and is only the beginning of planning. It still requires continuous efforts from various provinces and cities to meticulously refine it, closely focusing on the five main aspects of basic construction: production plans, labor plans, financial plans, material plans, and transportation plans, so as not to fall into a passive situation in the work. Attention should be paid to reducing costs when formulating plans. This year, efforts should be made to reduce costs by 10% in both design and construction. Third, it is necessary to seize the organization of construction and education work to change the current imbalance between strength and tasks. In the continued development of construction forces, it is recommended that the Party and the People's Governments of various provinces and cities vigorously allocate management and technical cadres to strengthen the leadership and technical level of construction departments and improve organizational structure. All construction departments should rapidly complete the democratic reform of construction workers, strengthen political education for construction workers, improve their class consciousness and work efficiency, and do a good job in labor insurance registration in preparation for the implementation of labor insurance. In order to better complete construction engineering tasks, it is imperative to pay close attention to establishing and strengthening trade union organizations and to intensify various training courses to cultivate a large number of grassroots cadres. In addition, construction departments in various regions are required to conduct typical experiments in production reform and do a good job in wage reform. Fourth, strive to learn, learn from Soviet experience, absorb the experience of advanced regions, and improve our own work.

    华东举行建筑会议讨论基本建设准备工作
    华东财政经济委员会和华东建筑工程局为了迅速完成一九五三年华东地区基本建设的准备工作，在一月六日到十二日召开了华东首次建筑会议，到会的有华东地区各省、市建筑工程部门及工会主要负责人百余人。
    这次会议解决了下面几个问题：一、根据华东现有的建筑力量，初步进行了建筑任务的排队工作。这样就可使华东建筑工程局较有把握地及时编制今年的工作计划，报中央核准。各省、市建筑工程部门代表也可心中有数地回去作必要的设计与施工的准备。二、集中和交流了各省、市设计与施工力量的组织情况及冬训的经验，防止了这方面可能发生的保守思想和急躁情绪，比较有计划有步骤地去发展建筑力量。如对固定工人问题，明确了固定的对象应为技工；又如在壮大建筑工人队伍问题上，亦纠正了某些地区包揽失业工人的偏向。三、由于对比了建筑任务和建筑力量，各省、市建筑部门根据自身的需要，比较切合实际地编制了本部门基本建设的投资数字，并经过协商、讨论，予以确定。四、研究了华东区建筑力量远远落后于建筑任务的情况，大家明确地认识了必须以国防与重工业建设为重点，保证最重要工程的完成。
    为了更好地完成今年度基本建设的准备工作，解决目前建筑力量小、任务大的矛盾，会议提出了如下的几个建议与要求，作为今后努力的目标：一、为了在抗美援朝和经济建设的两条战线上同时取得伟大的胜利，建筑部门的领导人员必须树立整体观念和重点建设观念，首先保证完成有关大局的重要国防建设和经济建设工程，然后争取完成更多的任务。同时，在承担任务时，必须服从中央的统一筹划，即使事先已答允承担地方的建设任务，以后如和中央要求的任务相矛盾，亦应权衡轻重，首先服从中央，服从整体利益。二、这次会议所编制的计划还是粗糙的，只是编制计划的开始，还待各省、市继续努力，精雕细刻，紧紧扣住基本建设中的生产计划、劳动计划、财务计划、材料计划及运输计划等五个主要环节，以免工作中陷于被动。在编制计划时，要注意降低成本。在今年内，在设计与施工两方面要达到降低成本百分之十的要求。三、要抓紧组织建设与教育工作，以改变目前力量与任务不平衡的状态。在继续发展建筑力量中，建议各省、市的党和人民政府大力调配管理及技术干部，加强建筑部门的领导力量与技术水平，健全组织机构。各建筑部门应迅速完成建筑工人的民主改革工作，加强对建筑工人的政治教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟和工作效率，做好劳动保险登记工作，准备实行劳动保险。为着更好完成建筑工程任务，必须切实注意建立与加强工会组织并加紧各种训练班工作，大量培养基层干部。此外，要求各地建筑部门进行生产改革的典型试验，做好工资改革工作。四、努力学习，学习苏联经验，吸收先进地区的经验，改进自己的工作。
