Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 29th: A delegation from the Bronx district of the Women's Peace Committee of New York City visited the Soviet Union's delegation to the United Nations on the 28th.

	They brought with them an appeal to the delegations of all countries attending the United Nations, expressing unease over the continuation of the Korean War. The appeal stated: The demand for a ceasefire in Korea has never been as widespread as it is now. The people of the United States and the people of other countries are demanding a ceasefire. There is no reason to prevent a ceasefire. The appeal firmly demanded that the delegations of all countries attending the United Nations support the firm demand of the people of all countries in the world: immediately cease hostilities in Korea, and then resolve all other issues through negotiations.

	These representatives told Roschin, an advisor to the Soviet Union's delegation to the United Nations, that they also intended to visit the delegations of other countries. However, the United States delegation to the United Nations refused to meet with them.

	Speaking of the struggle of women for peace, the representatives emphasized that the majority of American women and mothers support an immediate end to the bloody tragedy in Korea.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 30th: The New York "Daily Worker" of the 25th reprinted a letter recently published by the "Baltimore Evening Sun" from Mr. and Mrs. T. L. Ray, the parents of an American soldier captured in Korea. This is a typical letter among the countless letters sent to American newspapers, expressing the American people's growing anger at the US government's use of the prisoner of war issue to delay and prepare to expand the Korean War.

	The letter said: "We are the parents of a soldier captured in Korea... Our son is now in a prisoner of war camp with other prisoners of war, he is homesick, he is sad."

	Mr. and Mrs. T. L. Ray demanded an immediate ceasefire, and they questioned: "Why not stop the war immediately and leave the repatriation of prisoners of war to be dealt with later? ... Are we going to tolerate this pointless war continuing, with more of our children continuing to be killed and wounded? Must we see more families separated and more children, brothers and loved ones continue to fight and die every Christmas just because an issue between the warring countries has not been resolved? Is this the future for American youth?"

    纽约妇女代表向各国驻联合国代表团发出呼吁书
    坚决要求代表们支持实现朝鲜停火的主张
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：妇女和平委员会纽约市布朗克斯区的一个代表团，二十八日访问苏联驻联合国代表团。
    她们带来一份向各国出席联合国的代表团提出的呼吁书，呼吁书对朝鲜战争继续下去表示不安。呼吁书说：人们对于在朝鲜停火的要求从来没有像现在这样普遍。美国人民和其他国家的人民都要求停战。没有什么理由可以阻碍停火。呼吁书坚决要求各国出席联合国的代表团支持世界各国人民的坚决要求：立即在朝鲜停止敌对行动，然后通过谈判来解决其他一切问题。
    这些代表告诉苏联出席联合国代表团顾问罗申说，她们还打算访问其他国家的代表团。但是，美国出席联合国代表团拒绝接见她们。
    在谈到妇女争取和平的斗争时，代表们强调说：大多数美国妇女和母亲是支持立即停止朝鲜的流血惨剧的。
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】二十五日的纽约“工人日报”转载了“巴尔的摩太阳晚报”最近发表的一个在朝鲜被俘的美国士兵的父母特·勒·雷夫妇的来信。这是投寄给美国各报馆的无数封信里的一封典型的信，表示了美国人民对于美国政府利用战俘问题拖延并准备扩大朝鲜战争一事日益感到愤怒。
    这封信说：“我们是一个在朝鲜被俘士兵的父母……我们的儿子现在和其他战俘们一起呆在一个战俘营里，他想家，他感到伤心。”
    特·勒·雷夫妇要求立即停火，他们责问说：“为什么不马上停战而把遣返战俘问题留待以后处理呢？……难道我们将容忍这种无谓的战争一直继续下去，我们更多的孩子继续死伤吗？难道我们在每年圣诞节时必须看到更多的家庭离散，更多的孩子、兄弟和亲爱的人只因为交战国家间一个问题未得解决而继续打仗以至于战死吗？难道这就是美国青年的前途吗？”
