    Editor's Note: The victorious year of 1952 has passed, and the great year of 1953 has arrived. This new year is the first year of the nation's large-scale economic construction and also the first year for the realization of people's beautiful hopes. In these days of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, a vast number of readers have written to this newspaper, expressing their joyful feelings and their determination and desire to devote themselves to the nation's large-scale economic construction. We now select a portion of these letters for publication below:
    Welcoming the New Year, Welcoming the Nation's Large-Scale Economic Construction
    Letter from Li Shouqi, Secretary of the General Branch of the Shijingshan Power Plant
    Guarantee the Completion of Production Tasks and Train a Large Number of Technical Cadres
    Comrade Editor: Just as we were welcoming the New Year of 1953, our original plant director, the secretary of the Party's general branch, and a large number of other cadres from the Shijingshan Power Plant were transferred to more important positions in the nation's construction. This demonstrates the beginning of the nation's large-scale economic construction. All the employees who remained at the plant were thrilled by this exciting and joyous event. We bid them farewell with joyful feelings and beautiful beliefs, and we told them: We are determined and have the strength to run the factory even better – not only guaranteeing the completion of the state's production tasks, but also continuously training and sending cadres and electrical technicians for the many new power plants that will soon appear on the nation's vast fields.
    Before liberation, the Shijingshan Power Plant was a dilapidated mess of "machines of three generations old," "high costs and many accidents." In the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Party, and with the efforts of the original plant director, the secretary of the Party's general branch, and all the employees, this backward factory has finally been transformed. In 1952, the entire plant launched a production increase and conservation campaign, learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in burning low-value coal and rapid maintenance, and promoted the scientific round-the-clock inspection method. The employees used their brains to find shortcuts and tap potential. By the end of October 1952, we had completed the annual plan to increase production and conserve resources by 15 billion yuan two months ahead of schedule. Although the tasks assigned to us by the state in 1953 are arduous: electricity generation must increase by 13.68% compared to 1952, fuel costs must decrease by 16.03%, plant electricity consumption must decrease by 6%, and accidents must decrease by 60%. However, encouraged by the new situation of the nation's large-scale economic construction, we will use a hundred times the courage and strength to complete this glorious task. We will work hard in the following aspects:
    (1) Currently, we are launching a mass, scientific verification movement in our factory to tap the potential power of equipment and improve operating methods, set new work targets, implement quota management, and lay the foundation for economic accounting. This is the first necessary and feasible task in welcoming the large-scale economic construction tasks of 1953. We will lead by example and mobilize and organize all forces to do this work well.
    (2) Fuel costs account for the largest proportion of the power plant's electricity generation costs. In 1952, we initially learned to burn low-value coal, saving the state more than 100,000 tons of good coal and more than 3,300 transport train cars. In 1953, we plan to improve the operating technology of burning low-value coal and improve the equipment for burning low-value coal. We are currently rushing to repair the separator project for absorbing furnace ash using the warm shed construction method during the winter. After this project is completed, we can burn a large amount of low-value coal, fuel costs can be greatly reduced, and it will be possible to supply a large amount of cheap electricity to the newly constructed factories in the country.
    (3) Give full play to the strength of technical personnel and train a large number of cadres. Some of the technical personnel in the factory were transferred due to the needs of the nation's construction. Therefore, we plan to concentrate the strength of the technical personnel remaining in the factory to solve the technical problems in the factory; and under the principle of unified and flexible use, give full play to their technical strength. Let them first develop the various engineering design plans for 1953. This will overcome the difficulties of having few people, many tasks, and design not keeping up with construction. Now, our factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League positions are all equipped with a large number of deputies. We advocate that technical personnel take on apprentices. In 1952, our factory had already trained a group of young technicians, and in 1953 we will train them on a larger scale. We guarantee that when the state needs electrical technicians, we will send outstanding and truly capable technicians to the positions needed by the state.
    Our work is naturally not without difficulties. While watching the country launch large-scale economic construction with incomparable excitement, we are more clearly aware than ever that our political and ideological level and work ability are far behind the needs of the country, and we feel that the burden on our shoulders is heavier than ever. But as long as we work and study with more dedication than ever before, we will definitely be able to shoulder the tasks given to us by the Party and the state.

    Letter from Huo Fengqi, Agricultural Labor Model of Beijing Municipality
    Determined to Increase Production to Support National Industrial Construction
    Comrade Editor: I am a farmer from Luquan Village in the suburbs of Beijing. I often see state-owned farms near our village with one person driving a 60-horsepower tractor, which can cultivate more than 100 mu of land in eight hours; while in the same time, a farmer using a plow can only cultivate 7 mu. I often think: When will our country be able to manufacture a large number of tractors so that our farmers can use tractors to cultivate the land?
    1953 has arrived. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our beloved motherland is about to embark on large-scale economic construction. This is the beginning of the motherland's path to industrialization, and also the beginning of the realization of my personal hopes. I know that countless new factories and mines will appear in every corner of our country, and in the future, a large number of tractors, seeders, harvesters... will be manufactured. At that time, our farmers will also organize collective farms like Soviet farmers, use machines to cultivate and harvest; and live a happy life as shown in the Soviet film "Happy Life."
    In the three years since liberation, how much benefit has the motherland given me! In the old society, I worked as a hired hand for landlords for more than 30 years and suffered for more than 30 years. After liberation, my life has become happier year by year, and my feelings for the motherland have deepened day by day. From actual life, I realized that the country's industrialization will bring greater happiness to our farmers.
    After the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing in 1949, I listened to Chairman Mao's words and organized a mutual aid team with several poor farmers in the village; I became the leader of the team. In the past three years, our mutual aid team has become increasingly consolidated and developed; in September this year, it was expanded into an agricultural production cooperative with 34 households and 540 mu of land. Our production has increased year by year, and our lives have become better and better. One of the important reasons why we can increase production is the use of new agricultural tools. Only when the country's industrial construction is doing well can it provide us farmers with more and better new agricultural tools, and finally, it can also provide us with large-scale agricultural machinery. The country's industrialization has an inseparable relationship with our farmers' increased production!
    In the autumn of 1951, I represented the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing to participate in the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin. I visited factories in Tianjin and saw with my own eyes how many things a factory can manufacture for the people to use. If we farmers want to live a good life, we need a lot of industrial products, and we cannot do without the country's industrialization. During the National Day in 1952, I was invited by the Beijing Municipal People's Government to participate in the National Day celebration ceremony in the capital. I saw our army, navy, and air force pass before me like an irresistible torrent. This is a powerful force to defend our motherland. When the country is industrialized, our armed forces will be even stronger and will be able to more firmly defend the country and our happy lives.
    The benefits of the country's industrialization to us are too great. In order to support the country's large-scale economic construction, I am determined to strengthen unity and mutual assistance with all the members of the cooperative, work hard to produce, increase output, and supply the country with more grain and raw materials – and this is precisely to strive for our future and happier life to come faster.

    Letter from Yu Dejiang, Combat Hero of a Certain Army of the People's Liberation Army
    Grasp Weapons Tightly to Defend the Country's Peaceful Construction
    Comrade Editor: I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, now guarding the motherland's coastline. When I learned the good news that the motherland would begin large-scale economic construction in 1953, I was very excited. The glorious and bright future of the motherland is like the red sun that we see jumping out of the waves on the coast every day at dawn. The people of our country will create their infinitely happy and beautiful lives with unparalleled enthusiasm. I, a soldier defending the motherland, deeply feel the glory and greatness of my mission!
    I am the son of a poor peasant. In order to protect my home and land, completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, and defend the motherland and defeat the imperialist aggressors, I joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I have been injured five times in battle and shed a lot of blood. I know that my blood is shed for the motherland and will not be shed in vain. For the sake of the motherland, many martyrs sacrificed their lives, and many soldiers sacrificed their blood. And now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the country has begun large-scale economic construction. The lives of the martyrs and the blood of the soldiers have received the most precious price.
    I have made meritorious service in battle and won the glorious title of combat hero. When the country's large-scale economic construction arrives, I must maintain and develop this glory. I clearly know that imperialism will never be willing to give up its aggressive delusions, and will never be willing to let us carry out peaceful construction. I must continue to work hard to study politics, culture, and military technology, and skillfully master modern weapons. I will hold my weapons tightly, guard the country's coastline, and monitor the enemy like an eagle. Let the people of the motherland build our great motherland with peace of mind! If any aggressor dares to destroy our peaceful construction, we will definitely eliminate them!

### 迎接新年，迎接祖国大规模经济建设

第7版(读者来信专页)
专栏：

    编者按：胜利的一九五二年过去了，伟大的一九五三年已经来到。这新的一年，是祖国大规模经济建设开始的第一年，也是人们美好希望开始实现的第一年。在这送旧迎新的日子里，广大读者纷纷给本报来信，表示他们的欢欣心情以及投入祖国大规模经济建设的决心和愿望。现在选择一部分来信发表在下面：
    迎接新年，迎接祖国大规模经济建设
    石景山发电厂总支书记李寿祺来信
    保证完成生产任务并大量培养技术干部
    编辑同志：正当迎接一九五三年新年的时候，我们石景山发电厂原来的厂长、党总支书记和其他的大批干部都调走了，走向祖国建设更重要的岗位。这显示着祖国大规模经济建设的开始。我们留厂工作的全体职工都为这一振奋人心的大喜事而激动。我们怀着欢悦的心情和美好的信念送走了他们，并且告诉他们：我们有决心和力量把工厂办得更好——不但保证完成国家的生产任务，而且要源源不断地为祖国辽阔原野上即将出现的许多新的发电厂培养、输送干部和电业技术工人。
    解放以前，石景山发电厂是一个“机器老少三辈”、“成本高事故多”的烂摊子。三年来在党的正确领导下，在原来的厂长、党总支书记和全体职工的努力下，终于把这个落后的厂子改造过来。一九五二年全厂展开增产节约竞赛运动，学习了苏联烧低值煤和快速检修的先进经验，推广了科学巡回检查法，职工们开动脑筋找窍门、挖潜力。在一九五二年十月底就提前两个月完成全年增产节约一百五十亿元的计划。虽然一九五三年国家给予我们的任务是艰巨的：发电量比一九五二年要增加百分之十三点六八，燃料成本要降低百分之十六点零三，厂用电要降低百分之六，事故要降低百分之六十。但是在祖国展开大规模经济建设这一新的形势鼓舞下，我们将以百倍的勇气和力量来完成这一光荣的任务。我们是从这几方面来努力的：
    （一）现在，在我们厂展开一个群众性的、科学的查定运动，挖掘设备潜在力量和改进操作方法，订出新的工作指标，实行定额管理，为经济核算制打下基础。这是在迎接一九五三年的大规模经济建设任务中的首先一件必要的和可能做到的工作。我们将由领导亲自动手，动员和组织一切力量来做好这一工作。
    （二）电厂的发电成本中，燃料费占比重最大。一九五二年我们初步学会了烧低值煤，给国家节省了十万吨以上的好煤和三千三百多辆运输车皮。一九五三年我们准备提高烧低值煤的操作技术，改善烧低值煤的设备。我们正在冬季中用暖棚施工法抢修吸收炉灰的分离器工程。这一工程完成后便可以大量烧低值煤，燃料成本就可以大大地降低，就有可能向祖国新建设起来的工厂大量地供应廉价的电流。
    （三）充分发挥技术人员的力量和大量培养干部。这次厂里的一部分技术人员因为祖国建设的需要被调走了。因此我们准备集中留厂的技术人员力量来解决厂里的技术问题；并在统一灵活使用的原则下，充分发挥他们的技术力量。让他们首先把一九五三年的各项工程设计计划订制出来。这样就可以克服人手少、任务多、设计跟不上施工的困难。现在我们工厂的党、政、工、团各个工作岗位都大量配备副职。提倡技术人员带徒弟。一九五二年我们厂已经培养了一批青年技工，一九五三年我们将要更大规模地培养。保证当国家向我们要电业技术工人的时候，我们就把优秀的、真正顶事的技术工人送到国家需要的岗位上。
    我们的工作自然不是没有困难的，在眼看着国家展开大规模经济建设，怀着无比兴奋的同时，我们较任何时候都更加清醒地认识到自己的政治思想水平和工作能力远远跟不上国家的需要，感觉到自己肩上的担子较任何时候都要沉重。但只要我们比较任何时候都更加贯注全力地来工作和学习，我们一定能够把党和国家所给予我们的任务担当起来。

    决心提高生产支援国家工业建设
    编辑同志：我是北京郊区鹿圈村的一个农民。我经常见到我们村附近的国营农场一个人驾驶六十匹马力的拖拉机，八小时可以耕一百多亩地；而在同样的时间内，我们一个农民用犁耕地只能耕七亩。我常常这样想：什么时候我们国家能够制造大量的拖拉机，让我们农民都使用拖拉机耕地呢？
    一九五三年来到了，在毛主席的领导下，我们可爱的祖国就要开始进行大规模的经济建设。这是祖国走向工业化的开始，也是我个人希望实现的开始。我知道，无数新的工厂和矿山将出现在我们国家的各个角落里，而将来，就会制出大量的拖拉机、播种机、收割机……。那时，我们农民也要像苏联农民一样组织集体农庄，使用机器耕种和收割；过着像苏联电影“幸福的生活”里所表现的那样幸福的生活。
    解放三年多以来，祖国给了我多少好处啊！我在旧社会给地主当了三十多年的长工，受了三十多年的苦。解放后，我的生活一年比一年幸福，我对祖国的感情一天比一天深厚。而从实际生活中，我认识了：祖国走向工业化将给我们农民带来更大的幸福。
    一九四九年北京郊区土地改革后，我听了毛主席的话，和村里几户贫农组织起来，成立了互助组；我当了组长。三年多以来，我们的互助组日益巩固发展；今年九月已扩大为一个拥有三十四户、五百四十亩土地的农业生产合作社。我们的生产年年提高，生活愈过愈好。我们所以能够提高生产，使用新式农具是一个重要的原因。只有祖国工业建设搞得好，才能供给我们农民更多、更好的新式农具，最后还能供给我们大型的机械农具。祖国工业化对我们农民提高生产真是有着分不开的关系！
    一九五一年秋季，我曾代表北京郊区农民去天津参加华北城乡物资交流展览会，在天津参观了工厂，亲眼看到了一个工厂能制造出多少东西供人民使用。我们农民要日子过得好，就要很多工业品，也就离不开国家的工业化。一九五二年国庆节时，我曾被北京市人民政府邀请参加首都国庆节庆祝典礼观礼。我看到我们的陆空海军像一道不可抵抗的洪流在我面前过去。这是保卫我们祖国的强大力量。而祖国工业化了，我们的武装力量就会更加强大，就能更巩固地保卫着祖国和我们的幸福日子。
    祖国工业化对我们的好处太大了。为了支援祖国大规模经济建设，我决心和全体社员一起，加强团结互助，努力生产，提高产量，供给祖国更多的粮食和原料——而这也正是为了争取我们未来的更幸福的生活更快地到来。

    要握紧武器保卫祖国和平建设
    编辑同志：我是中国人民解放军的一个战士，现在守护在祖国的海防线上。当我知道祖国在一九五三年开始进行大规模经济建设的喜讯时，我真是万分兴奋。祖国光辉灿烂的前途，就像我们每天天快亮时在海岸上所看见的冲破海浪而跳跃出来的红日一样。我们国家的人民，将以无比的热情来创造自己无限幸福而美好的生活。我，一个保卫祖国的战士，深深感到自己任务的光荣和伟大！
    我是一个贫农的儿子。为了保家保田，彻底消灭国民党反动派，为了保卫祖国，打败帝国主义者的侵略，我参加了中国人民解放军。我在战斗中受过五次伤，流了许多鲜血。我知道：我的鲜血是为祖国而流的，是不会白流的。为了祖国，多少烈士献出了他们的生命，多少战士献出了他们的鲜血。而现在，祖国在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，开始进行大规模的经济建设。烈士们的生命和战士们的鲜血得到了最宝贵的代价。
    我在战斗中曾立过功，得到了战斗英雄的光荣称号。在祖国大规模经济建设到来的时候，我一定要保持并发扬这个光荣。我清醒地知道：帝国主义决不会甘心放弃侵略的妄想，决不会甘心让我们进行和平建设。我一定继续努力学习政治、文化和军事技术，熟练地掌握现代化的武器。我要紧紧地握着武器，守卫在祖国的海防线上，像一只雄鹰一样地监视着敌人。让祖国的人民放心地建设我们伟大的祖国吧！任何侵略者胆敢来破坏我们的和平建设，我们一定把它们消灭掉！
