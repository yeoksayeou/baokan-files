Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 24th: The Northwest Architectural Design Company, under the preparatory office of the Northwest Construction Engineering General Administration, is actively adjusting its organizational structure and personnel to speed up various design works in order to enable construction units to carry out spring construction on schedule.

The design tasks undertaken by the Northwest Architectural Design Company this year have increased fourfold compared to last year, and the design area accounts for about 40% of the main projects in the entire Northwest region. In order to concentrate the use of limited technical personnel, the company has changed its original organization, which was divided into design, structure, and valuation departments, into mixed groups where the three work together, implementing the specialization of technical personnel and the system of individual responsibility. All administrative work is now handled by administrative cadres, so that technical personnel do not have to take care of administrative work and can concentrate their efforts on design work. In addition, the method of apprenticeship has also been implemented. Engineers and technicians give the designed outline drawings to trainees to draw detailed construction drawings, which are finally reviewed by the engineers and technicians. This not only quickly improves the technical level of the trainees, but also allows the engineers and technicians to concentrate their efforts on design.

The Northwest Architectural Design Company began the standard design of general housing as early as August last year, and has now completed the design of single dormitories, family dormitories, canteens, kitchens, etc.; as well as more than 200 types of standard doors and windows. The company's geological survey strength has doubled compared to last year. For key projects that have been identified in the plan, the design is being accelerated in order to submit the technical design before spring construction.

    西北建筑设计公司加速进行各项设计工作
    【新华社西安二十四日电】西北建筑工程总管理处筹备处所属西北建筑设计公司，为了施工单位能按期进行春季施工，现在积极调整组织机构和人员，加速进行各项设计工作。
    西北建筑设计公司今年承担的设计任务比去年增加四倍，设计面积约占全西北区主要工程的百分之四十。为了集中使用有限的技术人员，该公司把原来以设计、结构、估价等工种分科的组织，改变为三者联合工作的混合组，实行技术人员的分工专业化，和分别负责制度。行政工作都改由行政干部担任，使技术人员不兼顾行政工作而集中力量参加设计工作。此外，还实行了带徒弟的办法，由工程师、技术员把设计好的概要图样，交给练习生去画施工详图，最后经工程师、技术员审查，这样不仅可很快提高练习生的技术水平，而且可以让工程师、技术员集中力量进行设计。
    西北建筑设计公司早在去年八月开始一般房屋的标准设计，现在已完成单人宿舍、家属宿舍、食堂、厨房等类；及标准门、窗二百多种的设计。该公司地质勘测力量已比去年增加了两倍。对于已经确定了计划的重点工程，正在加速设计中，以便在春季施工前交出技术设计。
