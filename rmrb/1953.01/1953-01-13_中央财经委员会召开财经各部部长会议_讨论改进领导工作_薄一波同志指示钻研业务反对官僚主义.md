    The Central Financial and Economic Commission Convenes Meeting of Ministers of Finance and Economic Departments
    Discussing Improving Leadership Work
    Comrade Bo Yibo Instructs on Studying Business and Opposing Bureaucracy
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council convened a meeting of ministers of central financial and economic departments on January 6th, presided over by Vice Chairman Bo Yibo. At the meeting, Comrade Bo Yibo made an important speech focusing on how to further study business and strengthen specific leadership of financial and economic work. The ministers present also reviewed their work in the past year, and, in connection with future tasks, examined the work of their respective departments.
    Comrade Bo Yibo said in his speech: In 1952, the national economy completed the recovery phase. Beginning in 1953, large-scale economic and cultural construction will be carried out in a planned way. The central financial and economic departments, especially the leading cadres of various departments, have extremely important responsibilities. The issue of leading cadres has already occupied an important position in national construction. He said: What is leadership? This question deserves our good study. If leading production, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, relies solely on signing documents and making general appeals, instead of delving into it, becoming experts, becoming insiders in the work, this is bureaucratic leadership. We must oppose this situation and carry out specific and practical leadership, which means conscientiously studying business and earnestly solving problems. Comrade Bo Yibo reviewed the work of the Financial and Economic Committee. He said: In the first half of 1952, we were busy with the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, and in the second half, we were busy formulating the 1953 plan and the draft of the national Five-Year Plan. There were few cadres and many things to do, and these things were new to us. Therefore, the Financial and Economic Committee provided less leadership for the specific business work of the various departments, and the leadership work was not broad or deep enough. This must be improved. And the leadership work of the departments under the Financial and Economic Committee must also be improved. He said: For example, the Ministry of Finance is a department that studies its business relatively well, but there are still some problems in its work that have not been thoroughly studied and effectively solved. For example, blind enthusiasm in various construction projects often breaks through the national budget in certain aspects, but the Ministry of Finance has not come up with ways to improve this situation; the Ministry of Finance has also failed to effectively supervise and improve phenomena such as the waste of state resources, improper use of state funds, large non-production expenditures, and bloated staffing. The management of income and expenditure is also not strict enough, especially in terms of expenditure, where the waste in certain expenditures is still significant. Another example is the Ministry of Commerce, which is also a department that studies its business relatively well. It has made great achievements in stabilizing the market and facilitating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, but it has done little and can even be said to have done poorly in serving consumers, studying the specific needs of the people by region, shortening capital turnover time, and reducing circulation costs and miscellaneous expenses. The Ministry of Agriculture is also a department that studies its business relatively well. They have also solved a series of problems in increasing unit area yield, but the situation of formalism and generalized leadership is still very serious. In addition to issuing instructions on spring plowing, summer weeding, drought resistance, and flood prevention every year, they have not done enough work on further studying new situations discovered in agriculture and raising new questions. The machinery industry is a very important production sector, but until now, it has not carried out factory ranking and adjustment work, and there are chaotic phenomena such as unclear tasks, disordered processes, no quotas, and no inspection systems, which have increased the difficulty of economic accounting. After talking about the work of several other departments, Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out: In order to improve our leadership, we must oppose bureaucracy and streamline institutions and levels. Leadership work must be in-depth and specific, delving into and learning technical knowledge, familiarizing ourselves with everything in the departments we lead, and being good at grasping new situations and new problems. In the future, the ministers of various departments should regularly go deep into factories, mines, and fields, meet with workers and peasants, conscientiously inspect work, and solve problems.
    After Vice Chairman Bo Yibo spoke, the ministers of various departments spoke in succession. Minister of Grain Zhang Naiqi said: Because he has not studied his business enough, he does not have a clear picture of the work in his mind, and he only knows a "general" idea of many problems. He is determined to change this situation in the future. He said: In the Ministry of Grain, the economic accounting system is still very poor; the bureaucratic style is also very serious, for example, signing documents, stamping layer upon layer, and no one is responsible. Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng said: After reading the New Year's Day editorial in the People's Daily criticizing the bureaucracy of relying solely on signing documents for leadership, he did not sleep all night and greatly alerted himself. Recently, several vice ministers of the Ministry of Agriculture have made divisions of labor, and they should strive to study their business and study hard in the future. Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi examined past work and said: The work of the Ministry of Water Resources was very passive in the past. On the one hand, it was affected by natural conditions, and on the other hand, it took too much care of local enthusiasm. As a result, too many projects were started, and instead of concentrating manpower and resources to do one job well before doing another, the result was that there was a lot of waste and poor quality in water conservancy projects, and the efficiency of engineering and equipment was not well utilized. Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan said: Because he had not studied his work and policies well in the past, there had been many deviations in the business of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. For example, when launching labor competitions, there was a phenomenon of forced subscription to books and newspapers and sending congratulatory telegrams, which violated policies and alienated the masses. Among the staff in the department, there was a simple advocacy of increasing labor intensity. He also cited specific examples to illustrate that leading cadres must specifically study various tasks and oppose the phenomenon of blindly adding personnel and arbitrarily expanding institutions. Vice Minister of Finance Wu Bo fully agreed with Comrade Bo Yibo's comments on the work of the Ministry of Finance and listed several examples to illustrate the necessity of studying business. He said that in order to do a good job in the 1953 budget, it is necessary to oppose conservative ideas, oppose departmentalism and partial viewpoints, and wage a principled struggle against violations of the financial system and financial discipline. Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao made a deep examination of the work in the past year, pointing out that the economic accounting work of the Ministry of Railways had not yet been done well, the experience of the Middle East Railway had not been systematically learned, and the leadership work was not comprehensive or in-depth. As a result, the work of the Ministry of Railways was characterized by rapid development of transportation business but slow progress in economic results, rapid development of operating railways but slow progress in new line construction, and rapid increase in the quantity of transportation work but slow progress in quality. He also cited many vivid examples to illustrate the huge waste and losses in operation and new line construction due to a lack of attention to cost work, and deeply exposed the bureaucratic phenomena in the work of the Ministry of Railways. He said that starting in 1953, the leadership of the Ministry of Railways must vigorously grasp the two working links of reducing costs and improving quality, conscientiously study business, and overcome the current phenomenon of "busy hands and feet, idle brains." Vice Minister of Forestry Li Fanwu examined the situation of commandism in various places, pointing out that as a result of forced orders, many good things that were originally beneficial to the people were turned into bad things opposed by the masses. Those who spoke at the meeting also included Vice Minister of Water Resources Li Baohua, Vice Minister of Heavy Industry Lü Dong, and Vice Minister of Fuel Industry Liu Lanbo.
    Comrade Bo Yibo finally made a concluding speech based on everyone's speeches and suggestions. He said: On the issue of studying business work, there are currently three situations. One is that they have studied but have not yet delved into it. These people should delve into it quickly. The second is that they have delved into it, and some have delved into it relatively deeply, while others have not delved into it deeply enough. These people should continue to delve deeply. The third is that they have not studied it at all and are not prepared to study it. The future of these people is very dangerous. For some of these people, we should cancel their jobs today and replace them with new people. He said: Today, we are facing new tasks and new situations. In order to undertake new work, we must study hard, use our brains more, and strengthen specific leadership. To this end, we must resolutely oppose bureaucracy. People with bureaucratic habits are satisfied with signing documents, satisfied with formalistically demanding statistics and reports, but do not seriously study and solve the actual problems behind these documents, nor do they study these statistical reports, and do not even clarify whether they are false statistics or false reports. They do not go into specific research on work, neither raising questions nor solving problems, "pushing" and "dragging" when things happen, and failing to get to the bottom of things to solve them. The masses call these people "meeting, errand-running, numerical" cadres, which is not an exaggeration at all. Secondly, Comrade Bo Yibo said, in order to do a good job, we must first clarify what we want to oppose and what we want to advocate. He pointed out: We must oppose the remnants of the supply system in enterprise management and advocate the concept of economic accounting; oppose blind enthusiasm in national construction work and advocate planning; oppose conservative thinking and advocate the exploration of reserve forces and potential forces. He said that the remnants of the supply system in enterprise management mean that in order to complete tasks, they do not calculate costs or care about results. These people are indifferent to the accumulation of national funds and are irresponsible. They do not have the concept of accumulating funds to industrialize the country. We must oppose this view and advocate the concept of economic accounting, which means advocating careful calculation, paying attention to increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, reducing non-production expenditures, and reducing management fees. As for the blindness in national construction, it is actually a manifestation of anarchism and disorganized thinking among economic workers. Some of these workers are driven by departmentalism, without taking into account the overall situation and national interests; others are full of enthusiasm, intending to do and complete all good things overnight, without considering the realistic possibilities. Blindness is a spontaneous force that strikes and resists national planning, and it is a harmful thing. We must oppose blindness and advocate doing things according to plan in order to ensure the smooth progress of industrial and national defense construction. To this end, Comrade Bo Yibo requested that the leaders of various departments should, in accordance with the spirit of the meeting, convene departmental meetings in the near future, communicate the information, and focus on summarizing the work in 1952 and study the key aspects of the work in 1953, resolutely opposing bureaucracy. Finally, he said: In order to strengthen specific leadership and facilitate inspection of work, various departments must grasp the following important tasks in 1953 and do a good job in them: (1) Ensure that the national production plan and basic construction plan are actually completed in terms of quantity, quality, and cost; check the degree of plan execution not by year or quarter, but not even by month, but by day and week. (2) Actively increase production and practice economy to accumulate national funds; consider increasing production and practicing economy as a method of completing the production plan and a source of accumulating funds. (3) Vigorously summarize and promote advanced experience. Do not promote a certain advanced experience in isolation. Instead, after discovering a certain advanced experience and testing it successfully, organizational measures should be taken to quickly adapt the relevant parts and workshops, avoiding the situation in some departments where the promotion of advanced experience leads to a large increase in waste because production is not adapted. (4) Study business, grasp the central link, and, according to the characteristics of the enterprises they lead, first do a good job in various most important tasks. He said: The above are the keys to whether the work in 1953 can be successful, and everyone is required to work hard to do the above work well.

    中央财经委员会召开财经各部部长会议
    讨论改进领导工作
    薄一波同志指示钻研业务反对官僚主义
    【本报讯】政务院财政经济委员会于一月六日召开中央财经各部部长会议，由薄一波副主任主持。会议上，薄一波同志以如何进一步钻研业务、加强财经工作的具体领导为中心，作了重要发言。到会各部部长也都回顾了去年的工作，联系今后的任务，检查了各部的工作情况。
    薄一波同志发言说：一九五二年国家经济完成了恢复阶段，一九五三年开始，即将进行有计划的大规模的经济和文化建设，中央财经各部门、特别是各部门的领导干部，责任十分重大，领导干部问题在国家建设中已占着重要的地位。他说：什么叫领导呢？这个问题值得我们很好地研究一下。如果领导生产，如同斯大林同志所指出的一样，专靠签署文件，进行一般的号召，而不是钻进去，变成专门家，变成工作内行，这就是官僚主义的领导。我们要反对这种情况，要进行具体和切实的领导，也就是要认真钻研业务，切实解决问题。薄一波同志就财政经济委员会的工作情况，进行了检查。他说：我们在一九五二年上半年忙于三反和五反，下半年又忙于制定一九五三年的计划和国家五年计划草案，干部少、事情多，而这些事情对我们说来又都是新事情，因此财政经济委员会对各部具体业务工作的领导较少，领导工作表现的不宽和不深。这是必须改进的。而财政经济委员会所属各部的领导工作，也必须加以改进。他说：例如财政部，这是钻研业务较好的一个部，但工作中仍然有一些问题并没有加以彻底研究和切实解决。如各项建设中的盲目积极性常常在某些方面突破国家预算，而财政部没有想办法改进这种情况；对于浪费国家资财、使用国家资金不恰当、非生产开支很大、人员编制膨胀等现象，财政部也没有很好地实行监督并改善这种情况。在收入和支出方面，管理的也还不严格，特别是支出方面，某些开支中的浪费还很大。又例如商业部，也是钻研业务较好的一个部，在稳定市场、畅通城乡物资交流方面，有很大的成绩，但为消费者服务的工作，按地区研究人民的具体需要的工作，缩短资金周转时间的工作，减少流转费、减少杂费开支的工作，都作得很少而且可以说是作得很坏。农业部也是钻研业务较好的一个部，他们在提高单位面积产量上也解决了一系列的问题，但是形式主义、一般化领导的情形还是很严重。他们除了年年发布春耕夏锄、抗旱防涝等等指示而外，如何进一步研究农业中发现的新的情况、提出新的问题，这项工作也作得很不够。机械工业这是极重要的一个生产部门，但直至现在还没有进行工厂排队和调整的工作，存在着任务不明、工序混乱、无定额、无检验制度等混乱现象，对经济核算增加了困难。薄一波同志在讲到其他几个部的工作情况以后指出：为了改进我们的领导，必须反对官僚主义，精简机构，精简层次。领导工作必须深入具体，钻进去学习技术知识，熟悉自己所领导的部门的一切情况，善于掌握新的情况和新的问题。以后各部部长应该经常深入工厂、矿山、田间，和工人农民见面，认真检查工作，解决问题。
    薄一波副主任讲话后，各部部长相继发言。粮食部部长章乃器说：由于自己钻研业务不够，在工作中心中无数，很多问题只知道个“大概”，今后决心改变这种情况。他说：在粮食部中，经济核算制还作得很差；官僚主义作风也很严重，例如签署文件，层层盖章，谁也不负责任。农业部部长李书城说：看了人民日报元旦社论中对专靠签署文件进行领导的官僚主义的批评以后，一夜没有睡着觉，大大警惕了自己。最近农业部几个副部长已作了分工，今后应该努力钻研业务，用心学习。水利部部长傅作义检查过去的工作说：水利部工作过去很被动，一方面是由于受自然条件影响，一方面是过多地照顾了地方积极性，因而摊子摆得多，不是集中人力物力作好一件工作再作一件，结果水利工程中浪费多，质量差，工程效率和设备效率都未很好发挥。邮电部部长朱学范说：由于过去没有很好钻研工作、学习政策，邮电部的业务曾有许多偏差。如发动劳动竞赛时，曾发生订书、订报、拍贺电的强拉硬派现象，结果违反了政策，脱离了群众，在部内工作人员中，则单纯提倡了加强劳动强度。他并举出具体事例，说明领导干部必须具体研究各项工作，反对盲目增添人员任意扩大机构的现象。财政部副部长吴波完全同意薄一波同志对财政部工作的意见，并列举若干事例，说明钻研业务的必要。他说，要作好一九五三年的预算工作，必须反对保守思想，反对本位思想与局部观点，向违反财政制度和财政纪律的行为进行原则的斗争。铁道部副部长吕正操对过去一年的工作作了深刻的检查，指出铁道部经济核算工作还没有很好作起来，学习中长路的经验也不系统，领导工作不全面不深入，因而铁道部的工作是运输业务发展快而经济效果进步慢，营业铁路发展快而新线工程进步慢，运输工作中数量上升快而质量进步慢。他并举出很多生动的例子，说明由于不注意成本工作以致在经营和新线修建中的巨大浪费和损失，并深刻地揭发了铁道部工作中的官僚主义现象。他说，一九五三年开始，铁道部领导上必须大力抓住降低成本和提高质量两个工作环节，认真钻研业务，克服目前“手脚忙乱、头脑清闲”的现象。林业部副部长李范五就各地命令主义现象的情况作了检查，指出由于强迫命令的结果，使许多本来是有益于人民的好事，被作成了为群众所反对的坏事。会上发言的，还有水利部副部长李葆华、重工业部副部长吕东、燃料工业部副部长刘澜波等。
    薄一波同志最后根据大家的发言和建议作了总结性的发言。他说：在业务工作的钻研问题上，目前有三种情况，一是钻了但还没有钻进去，这种人应该快钻；一是钻进去了，其中有的钻的比较深，有的钻的还不深，这种人应该继续深钻；一是根本没有钻，也不准备钻，这种人的前途是很危险的。其中有些人，我们今天就应该取消他们的工作，用新的人来代替了。他说：今天正面临着新的任务新的情况，为了担负起新的工作，就必需用心学习，多用脑筋，加强具体领导。为此就要坚决反对官僚主义。有官僚主义习气的人，他们满足于签署文件，满足于形式主义地要统计要报告，而并不认真地研究和解决这些文件背后的实际问题，也不研究这些统计报告，甚至不弄清楚它们是不是假统计假报告。他们不深入具体地去研究工作，既提不出问题，也不解决问题，遇事“推”、“拖”，而不能追根到底加以解决。对这种人，群众叫他们是“开会、跑腿、数目字”干部，这是一点也不过分的。其次，薄一波同志说，为了作好工作，我们必须首先弄清楚我们要反对什么，提倡什么。他指出：必须反对企业管理工作中的供给制残余，提倡经济核算的观点；反对国家建设工作中的盲目积极性，提倡计划性；反对保守思想，提倡发掘后备力量和潜在力量。他说，企业管理中的供给制残余，就是为了完成任务，不计算成本，不计较效果，这种人对国家资金积累漠不关心，不负责任，他们没有积累资金使国家工业化的观点。我们必须反对这种观点，提倡经济核算的观点，也就是提倡精打细算，注意增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，减少非生产开支，减少管理费用等。至于国家建设中的盲目性，实际上是经济工作人员中一种无政府无组织思想的表现。这些工作人员有的是由本位主义出发，不照顾全局及国家利益；有的是由于满腔热情，意图把一切好事都在一朝一夕办好办完，而不考虑现实的可能。盲目性是向着国家计划性进行冲击和抵抗的一种自发力量，这是一种有害的东西。我们必须反对盲目性，并提倡按计划办事，才能保证工业和国防建设的顺利进行。为此，薄一波同志要求各部领导同志都应该根据会议精神，最近期间分别召开各部部务会议，进行传达，并有重点地总结一九五二年工作，研究一九五三年工作的环节，坚决反对官僚主义。最后，他说：为了加强具体领导，并便于检查工作，各部一九五三年必须抓着以下几项重要工作，认真作好，这就是：（一）保证国家生产计划和基本建设计划在数量上质量上成本上确实的完成；不是按年按季也不是按月而应该是按日按周地去检查计划执行的程度。（二）积极增产节约积累国家资金；要把增产节约看成是完成生产计划的方法和积累资金的源泉。（三）大力总结和推广先进经验。不是孤立地推广某一条先进经验，而是发现了某一条先进经验加以试验成功后，就应经过组织措施，迅速使有关的各部分各车间适应起来，避免现在某些部门中在推广先进经验时因为生产不适应反而大量增加浪费的情况。（四）钻研业务，抓住中心环节，根据自己所领导企业的特点，首先作好各种最关紧要的工作。他说：以上这些乃是一九五三年工作能否有成绩的关键，要求大家务必努力作好以上工作。
