Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Labor convened the National Labor Protection Work Conference in late December 1952. The conference summarized the labor protection work experience of the past three years, formulated three documents: "Decision on Strengthening Labor Protection Work," "Provisional Regulations on Factory Safety and Hygiene," and "Provisional Regulations on Protecting Female Workers." It also exchanged detailed opinions on issues such as working hours, strengthening labor protection organizations, and establishing labor protection inspectors in factories and mining enterprises.

Li Lisan, Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Labor, delivered a report at the conference summarizing the labor protection work of the past three years and outlining the future direction and tasks. He explained in detail the achievements, shortcomings, and experiences of past labor protection work, and pointed out the practices to be followed in various aspects under the general guideline of implementing safe production in the future. During the conference, Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, He Cheng, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Health, Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, and others attended and delivered speeches. Lai Ruoyu said: To rely on the masses to do a good job in production, the safety and health of workers must be considered simultaneously in the production process. Otherwise, it will be impossible to rely on the workers. We cannot imagine that a factory with frequent accidents can have high worker enthusiasm. Therefore, ensuring the safety and health of workers is not only in line with the current interests of the working class, but also in line with the long-term interests of the working class. He Cheng said: The health department has done some work in the past three years, but due to weak subjective forces, the health work in factories and mines has not been done well enough. At the same time, the factories and mines themselves have not paid enough attention to health work. In order to cooperate with national economic construction, it is necessary to strengthen industrial and mining hygiene work in the future, and resolutely implement the principle of prevention first and treatment as a supplement to prevent and control occupational diseases and common diseases in industry. To this end, the Ministry of Health plans to hold a conference on industrial and mining hygiene in conjunction with the Ministry of Labor. Rong Gaotang said: To make production better, it is necessary to promote sports to strengthen the physique of workers. Representatives of various industrial sectors and regions introduced typical experiences in doing a good job in labor protection and put forward many important opinions on how to improve work in the future.

Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, also attended the meeting and gave important instructions. He pointed out that labor administrative departments have an important responsibility in the country's large-scale economic construction, mainly: to do a good job in labor force allocation, and ensure that the labor force needed for economic construction can be supplied in a planned and reasonable manner; and to do a good job in labor protection to ensure the smooth completion of the national production task, which is constantly developing forward. He said that in the past three years, with the restoration and transformation of enterprises, labor protection work has achieved great results. The general trend of casualty accidents is declining. However, after the development of the increase production and practice economy movement, casualty accidents in some industrial sectors and some regions are still very serious, which shows that there are still many problems in the work of factories and mining enterprises. He then affirmed several major experiences in labor protection work in various places: First, safety and hygiene inspections are a good way to strengthen labor protection work. Through inspections, the masses can be mobilized, many problems can be discovered, and cadres can be educated. At the same time, problems can be solved by relying on the masses. In many places, 70% to 80% of the problems are solved by the masses themselves. Therefore, in 1953, this method should continue to be adopted on the basis of past inspections, seeking universality and depth, but the time can be shortened, and attention should be paid to solving key problems to prevent formalism and achieve greater results. Second, many accidents occur because there are no rules or regulations, or because there are rules and regulations but they are not implemented, and the workers do not know or understand them. In order to plug this loophole, safety operating procedures should be established and improved, and safety education for workers, especially for new workers, should be strengthened. Third, due to the mess left over from the reactionary rule, there is almost no safety and hygiene equipment at all, so special attention should be paid to this issue. The guidelines are: (1) All common equipment problems that can be solved should be solved quickly. Major safety and hygiene equipment should be solved in a planned and phased manner based on the financial strength of the enterprise. (2) Grasp the three key issues of "death," "injury," and "disease." Problems related to death, injury, and disease should be solved first. (3) Improving safety and hygiene equipment should be combined with improving production, from treating the symptoms to getting to the root cause. The above refers to the problem of doing a good job in labor protection in enterprises. Basic construction departments must act in accordance with science and do a good job in safety and hygiene equipment at the same time.

Jia Tuofu then pointed out that to do a good job in labor protection, the policy of safe production must be implemented. He said that this idea is not very clear now, and in the future it must be carried out according to Chairman Mao's instructions: "While implementing increased production and practicing economy, we must pay attention to the safety, health, and indispensable welfare of workers; if we only pay attention to the former and forget or slightly ignore the latter, it is wrong." Production must be safe, and safety is for production. The two are one and inseparable. Jia Tuofu said: When dealing with labor protection issues, necessity and possibility should be combined. If it is necessary but temporarily impossible, it should be solved gradually in stages, and one cannot ask for it too urgently. It is wrong to do what can be done but is not done, and it is also wrong to do what is impossible and to force it. The same spirit should be applied to issues such as working hours and protecting female workers.

Jia Tuofu pointed out that labor protection departments must work in conjunction with factory and mining enterprise management departments and trade union organizations. The policy of safe production should first be implemented from the administrative leadership of factories and mines, and at the same time, labor administrative departments should strengthen inspection and supervision and assist in solving problems. The organizations in charge of labor protection work in enterprise administrative departments should be guided by labor administrative departments in their work. The positions and viewpoints of these two aspects are consistent, but the phenomenon of some factory and mine administrations not paying attention to safety and hygiene should be criticized.

He pointed out that the safety and hygiene conditions in private factories and mines are much worse than in state-owned enterprises. Labor administrative departments should strengthen inspection and supervision work and urge private enterprises to make possible and practical improvements. Labor protection organizations must be established in factories and mines and gradually improved. It is best for one of the factory director or deputy factory director to be in charge of this work concurrently to take care of the overall situation.

Li Lisan said in his summary that Deputy Director Jia Tuofu's report is the common policy for industrial management departments, labor administrative departments, and trade union organizations to carry out labor protection work. Everyone should strengthen labor protection work ideologically, in terms of equipment, systems, and organizations, according to this instruction, and implement the idea of safe production into plans, systems, the masses, and discipline.

A total of 142 people attended and attended this meeting, including those in charge of labor protection work from various industrial departments of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, various industrial trade unions, and major administrative regions, major cities' financial committees, industrial departments (bureaus), labor departments (bureaus), and trade union organizations.

    中央劳动部召开全国劳动保护工作会议  总结劳动保护工作经验
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府劳动部在一九五二年十二月下旬召开了全国劳动保护工作会议，总结了三年来的劳动保护工作经验，拟定了
    “加强劳动保护工作的决定”、“工厂安全卫生暂行条例”、“保护女工暂行条例”三个文件，并就工作时间问题、加强劳动保护组织机构和在厂矿企业中设立劳动保护监察员等问题详细交换了意见。
    中央人民政府劳动部部长李立三在会上作了关于三年来劳动保护工作总结与今后方针任务的报告，详细说明了过去劳动保护工作的成绩、缺点和经验，指出了今后在贯彻执行安全生产的总方针下各方面的作法。会议进行中，中华全国总工会秘书长赖若愚、中央人民政府卫生部副部长贺诚、中华全国体育总会秘书长荣高棠等都曾到会讲话。赖若愚说：要依靠群众搞好生产，那么在生产中间就必须同时考虑工人的安全、健康，否则，依靠工人群众就依靠不上。我们不能想像，一个工厂经常出事故，而工人的生产积极性会很高。因此保障工人的安全健康是既符合于工人阶级的当前利益，又符合于工人阶级长远利益的。贺诚说：卫生部门三年来做了一些工作，但由于主观力量薄弱，工厂矿山卫生工作做得不够，同时工厂矿山本身也对卫生工作重视不够。为了配合国家经济建设，今后必须加强工矿卫生工作，切实贯彻预防为主、治疗为辅的方针，防治工业中的职业病、多发病，为此卫生部拟协同劳动部召开一次工矿卫生会议。荣高棠说：要把生产搞得更好，必须提倡体育运动，以加强工人的体质。各产业部门和各地区的代表在发言中介绍了做好劳动保护工作的典型经验，并对今后改进工作的办法提出了许多重要的意见。
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任贾拓夫也到会作了重要指示。他指出劳动行政部门在国家大规模经济建设中负有重要责任，主要是：做好劳动力调配工作，保证逐渐做到能有计划地、合理地供给经济建设所需要的劳动力；做好劳动保护工作，保证顺利完成国家生产不断向前发展的任务。他说，三年来，劳动保护工作随着企业的恢复和改造，取得了很大的成绩。伤亡事故的总趋势是在下降。但在增产节约运动开展以后，若干产业部门和若干地区的伤亡事故还很严重，这说明工厂矿山企业的工作中还存在不少问题。接着他肯定了各地劳动保护工作中的几项主要经验：第一，安全卫生大检查是加强劳动保护工作的很好办法，通过检查可以发动群众，可以发现许多问题，可以使干部受到教育；同时可以依靠群众解决问题，许多地方有百分之七八十的问题都是由群众自己解决的。因此，一九五三年还应在过去检查的基础上继续采用这种办法，求得普遍与深入，但时间可以缩短，并注意解决关键问题，防止形式主义，求得更大的效果。第二，很多事故的发生是由于没有制度，或有制度而没有贯彻执行，工人群众还不知道，不懂得。为了堵住这个漏洞，应该把安全操作规程制度建立和健全起来，加强对工人群众的安全教育工作，特别是对新工人的教育。第三，由于反动统治时期遗留下来的烂摊子，几乎完全没有安全卫生设备，所以对这个问题应特别重视。方针是：（一）凡是力所能及的普通设备问题，要迅速设法解决，重大的安全卫生设备，则应依据企业财政力量采取有计划地分期解决的办法。（二）抓住“死”、“伤”、
    “病”三个要害问题，凡关系到死人、伤人、疾病的问题应该首先努力设法解决。（三）改进安全卫生设备应与改进生产结合起来，从治标到治本。以上是指在企业中作好劳动保护工作的问题。基本建设部门，必须切实按科学办事，把安全卫生设备同时搞好。
    贾拓夫接着指出，要做好劳动保护工作，必须贯彻安全生产的方针。他说，现在这个思想还不很明确，今后必须根据毛主席的指示进行：“在实施增产节约的同时，必须注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业；如果只注意前一方面，忘记或稍加忽视后一方面，那是错误的。”生产必须安全，安全为了生产，两位一体，不能分割。贾拓夫说：处理劳动保护问题时，要把必要和可能结合起来。如果是必要而暂时不可能的，就要分期逐步解决，不能要求过急。可能作而不作是错误的，不可能作而勉强去作也是错误的。工作时间，保护女工等问题，也要本此精神进行。
    贾拓夫指出，劳动保护部门与工厂矿山企业管理部门和工会组织必须互相结合来进行工作。安全生产方针首先应从厂矿行政领导上加以贯彻，同时劳动行政部门应加强检查监督，协助解决问题；企业行政部门管理劳动保护工作的机构，在业务上应受劳动行政部门的指导。这两方面的立场、观点是一致的，但对某些厂矿行政不重视安全卫生的现象，是要进行批评的。
    他指出私营厂矿企业中的安全卫生状况，比国营企业坏得多，劳动行政部门更要加强检查监督的工作，督促私营企业作可能的切实的改进。厂矿中必须建立劳动保护机构，并逐步健全起来。厂长、副厂长中最好有一人兼管这一工作，照顾全面。
    李立三在总结中说，贾拓夫副主任的报告，是产业管理部门、劳动行政部门和工会组织进行劳动保护工作的共同方针。大家应根据这个指示，从思想上、设备上、制度上、组织上加强劳动保护工作，把安全生产思想贯彻实行到计划中、制度中、群众中、纪律中去。
    出席和列席这次会议的，有中央人民政府各产业主管部门、中华全国总工会、各产业工会及各大行政区、各大城市财委、工业部（局）、劳动部
    （局）、工会组织的劳动保护工作负责人等共一百四十二人。
