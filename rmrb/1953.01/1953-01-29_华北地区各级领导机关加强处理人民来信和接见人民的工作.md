    Leadership organs at all levels in the North China region have gradually come to attach importance to and establish the work of handling letters from the people and receiving the people under the direct instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The issuance of the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People's Work" further promoted this work. The North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee vigorously handled the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" in July 1952. In mid-November of the same year, it convened a special meeting of relevant cadres from various provinces, cities, and some prefectural committees. After the meeting, it promulgated documents such as the "Instructions on Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses" and the "Procedures for Handling People's Letters and Receiving the Masses," which played a significant role in promoting the importance attached to this work by leadership organs at all levels in North China.

    The Tianjin Municipal Committee, the Hebei Provincial Committee, and the Shanxi Provincial Committee successively convened special meetings in November and December of last year to convey the spirit of the North China Bureau meeting and instructed Party committees at all levels to inspect the handling of mass letters and reception of the masses in their respective areas. The Mengsui Sub-bureau, in addition to forwarding the North China Bureau Office's procedures for handling people's letters, also issued supplementary instructions. Beijing Municipality improved this work by using opinion boxes for general investigation. Due to the importance attached by leadership organs at all levels, the number of letters and visits from the masses in various places has increased further. After December, the North China Bureau received more than 20 letters a day, more than double the number in October; an average of four to five mass visits were received each day. The Beijing Municipal People's Government received 118 people in October last year, which increased to 196 in November and 250 in December. During this period, the problems reflected in mass letters and visits were broader and deeper than before, ranging from finding jobs, civil disputes, and marriage problems to exposing counter-revolutionaries, reporting tax evasion, and making suggestions on urban construction and public health. Letters bravely exposing cadre bureaucracy, coercion, and cadres' violations of law and discipline increased even more. For example, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government received nearly 400 letters criticizing cadre work style from January to October last year, averaging 39 letters per month. In December alone, it received 104 letters of the same nature, an increase of nearly two times. According to the classification statistics of 5,619 letters by the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the CCP, 1,293 letters reported cadres' violations of law and discipline, corruption, violation of policies, unstable stance, and suppression of democracy, accounting for 23 percent; 1,175 letters reported the illegal activities of counter-revolutionaries, landlord counterattacks, and other bad elements, accounting for about 21 percent; 701 letters contained criticisms and suggestions on various tasks, accounting for slightly more than 12 percent. The above three categories accounted for more than half of the letters. Letters from the masses and cadres exposed many shocking events, such as the incident of village cadre Niu Luolian in Taidi Village, Yi County, Hebei Province, oppressing the masses, the injustice suffered by Tang Ruilin in Nanle County, Pingyuan Province, for ten years, the three incorrect arrests and two incorrect judgments of Liu Erlan in Shendongcheng Village, Xian County, Hebei, and the cases of Yang Yuehui in Tianjin, Guo Jinsheng in Hebei, and Zhang Sanyuan and Mi Gedu in Shanxi, which had not been resolved for many years, were all exposed in mass letters and were properly handled, enabling leadership organs at all levels to deal with bad people and bad deeds as early as possible.

    The masses dare to write letters again and again to inquire, criticize, and propose solutions if the problems they raise are not resolved in a timely manner, which is very different from the past. For example, Zhu Wanshun and Liu Maolong, workers of the Junliangcheng Rice Mill in Hebei, and others, continuously wrote and called the North China Bureau to urge the resolution of the problems in the "Three-Anti" campaign. One letter stated: "The North China Bureau's spirit of being responsible to the people has greatly moved us. We can only repay the Party by working hard in production. We hope you will urge the Hebei Provincial Committee to resolve our problems quickly." Another letter said: "We are sending you another quick letter to urge the relevant departments to send cadres to investigate and handle the matter and resolve it quickly." It also said: "We will wait another week. If it is not resolved, we will find you to resolve it no matter what." Hou Yuting from Datong wrote to the North China Bureau, wanting it to "definitely send Party cadres down so that I can feel at ease, and I hope it will be resolved soon." Wang Jingfang, a cadre from a factory in Shanhaiguan, wrote: In order to "welcome the economic construction in 1953, please send someone to resolve it quickly, don't delay it, and give me a reply." There are many similar letters. These letters are filled with trust in the Party and the government, especially in Chairman Mao; at the same time, they also express the courage to make criticisms and suggestions in a reasonable and justified manner. All of these show that the masses' awareness of being masters of their own affairs is constantly improving.

    Since the second half of last year, North China has generally been able to handle mass letters promptly and in a timely manner, and the backlog has been greatly reduced. Of the total number of mass letters received last year, the Party committees above the prefectural level in the North China region have settled an average of more than 60 percent of the cases. The Handan Prefectural Committee of the CCP in Hebei Province was 76 percent, and the Public Security Department of Suiyuan Province was 70 percent. Shanxi Province's treatment of mass letters as one of the contents of the People's Congress had very good results. In October of last year, the Yuncheng Prefectural Committee of the CCP in Shanxi organized nearly 100 cadres to conduct a region-wide inspection. Within two months, they processed 588 mass letters, and each was properly handled. Four prefectural committees in Hebei Province have held inspection conferences of 100 to 200 cadres based on the materials revealed in the mass letters, and they have been handled separately. Seriously handling mass letters not only relieved the suffering of the masses, enhanced the people's sense of being masters of their own affairs, and educated the masses; at the same time, it was a very vivid, practical, and profound education for all cadres, and thus improved work and strengthened the ties between the Party, the government, and the people. The leading organs in the North China region regard the handling of people's letters and visits as an important front and fighting force against bureaucracy, commandism, and illegal acts. The anti-bureaucracy struggle launched in the North China region after October of last year all began with typical events revealed by the masses, and then entered a general or key inspection. The reason why this work has achieved these results is first of all because the leading organs in North China have constantly heard that Chairman Mao attaches great importance to this work, and have constantly seen Chairman Mao's personal instructions. The North China Bureau Office currently has 24 mass letters that Chairman Mao personally approved for the North China Bureau to handle in its archives. Each instruction from Chairman Mao has an immeasurable encouraging power for the cadres who handle mass letters. Secondly, Comrade Liu Lantao, the Third Secretary of the North China Bureau, also cares very much about this work and reads many important letters from the masses every day. He personally wrote letters to the responsible comrades of the provincial and prefectural committees for several extremely important cases revealed by mass letters. He also often conveyed Chairman Mao's spirit to the comrades in charge of this work, instructed the principles and methods of handling, and checked the handling situation. He often said: "This is the greatest help the masses can give us. The masses help us discover problems, educate us, and encourage us through letters. We support the people, encourage the people, and lead the people to move forward bravely through this work."

    However, from the perspective of the entire North China region, there are still serious shortcomings in the work of handling people's letters and receiving people. Many counties and even higher-level leading organs have adopted an incorrect attitude towards this work. As pointed out in the People's Daily editorial on January 19, some leading organs do not value the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, do not feel the seriousness of bureaucracy and violations of law and discipline in their areas, do not seriously handle people's letters, and do not launch a resolute struggle against bad people and bad deeds. They procrastinate, perfunctorily shirk their responsibilities; or they listen to only one side of the story, conceal evil and promote good; or they are sloppy, lose their principled position, and do not separate themselves from bad people and bad deeds. According to recent inspections, the mother of Li Chunhai, a railway worker in Baotou City, appealed to the North China Bureau that her son had been wrongly accused of being a corrupt element. The North China Bureau ordered the Baotou Municipal Committee to investigate and deal with it in August last year, but the Baotou Municipal Committee transferred it to the Suiyuan Provincial Court for handling, and there has been no result so far. The Tongxian Prefectural Committee of Hebei still has six people's letters transferred by the North China Bureau in 1951 that have been shelved and not handled, and one of the original letters has been lost by the Prefectural Committee's office. Even worse: An Fenming, a family member of a revolutionary martyr in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, wrote to the North China Bureau saying that she had traveled back and forth between the village and the county 118 times for a housing dispute and had not been resolved. The Jiahe County Committee of Hebei Province did not know how many mass letters it had received and processed at all. The opinion box set up in Dongguang County, Hebei Province, was not opened for more than three months. When the box was opened to retrieve the letters, more than 30 mass letters had accumulated. These letters were all stuck together and blurred by the rain.

    In order to further improve the work of handling mass letters and receiving people's visits, the North China Bureau convened a "Symposium on Handling Mass Letters and Receiving People's Visits" on January 16. Responsible comrades and relevant personnel from the People's Supervisory Committee of the North China Administrative Committee, the General Office of the North China Bureau, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau, and the North China Branch of the Supreme People's Court attended the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Comrade Liu Lantao. Comrade Liu Lantao elaborated on the nature of this work in great detail: The materials revealed in the people's letters and visits are extremely valuable. Many problems cannot be seen in formal reports, and they are of great enlightenment to our leading organs. They are a powerful front for continuing to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline, and are an important method for the Party and government organs to strengthen ties with the masses. Our Party and government only have the obligation to handle them seriously, and do not have the right to shelve them or handle them perfunctorily. Because it is our bounden duty to be responsible to the people. Therefore, we must adopt a sincere and welcoming attitude and a responsible spirit towards the people's letters and visits, and continue to handle them without any carelessness. As for the few bad elements who dare to take advantage of our enthusiasm to serve the people (but this is very individual), take advantage of loopholes, stir up trouble, and frame good people, don't be afraid, as long as we pay attention, we can find out. When talking about how to specifically strengthen this work in the future, Comrade Liu Lantao, in addition to severely criticizing the mistakes of some leading organs that do not value this work, explained in detail the working methods, systems, and other issues, and emphasized the following two points: First, it is necessary to solve the division of labor among various departments. In the future, the Party committee will be responsible for organizing and inspecting all mass letters and visits, and typical handling of major events. However, daily letters should be transferred to the relevant business departments for handling as much as possible, so that each department can have direct contact with the masses through this work, so that cadres in all departments can understand the reactions of their work among the masses and be educated and improve their work. Doing so can also adapt to the increasing number of letters and visits from the masses. Second, the important link in strengthening the work of handling mass letters and receiving people's visits is in the lower-level organs, especially the county-level organs. However, the actual situation of handling people's letters by the leading organs of many counties is still unsatisfactory. The masses reflect that "the higher level is good at solving problems" and "there is truth in Beijing," which is a solemn criticism of certain organs and certain cadres. Our responsibility is to help them learn how to handle mass letters and visits from the ideological and concrete methods.

    华北地区各级领导机关加强处理人民来信和接见人民的工作
    华北地区各级领导机关对于处理人民群众来信和接见人民的工作，是在毛主席、党中央的直接指示下，逐渐重视、逐渐建立起来的。中央人民政府政务院发布“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”后，进一步推动了这项工作。中共中央华北局在一九五二年七月大张旗鼓地处理了“张顺有事件”，同年十一月中旬，又召集各省、市及部分地委有关干部开了专门会议，会后并公布了“关于处理人民来信接见人民群众工作的指示”、“处理人民来信、接见人民群众工作的程序”等文件，对推动华北各级领导机关重视此项工作上，起了极大作用。
    天津市委、河北省委、山西省委先后在去年十一、十二月份召开了专门会议，传达了华北局会议的精神，并指示各级党委对当地处理群众来信与接见群众的工作，进行检查。蒙绥分局除转发了华北局办公厅处理人民来信的程序外，并发布了补充指示。北京市则用普查意见箱的办法，改进这项工作。由于各级领导机关的重视，各地群众来信、来访的数目更形增多。十二月份以后，华北局每日接到来信达二十多件，比十月份增加一倍以上；接见群众来访平均每日四起至五起。北京市人民政府去年十月接见群众一百十八人，十一月份增至一百九十六人，十二月份则达二百五十人。在这一个时期，群众来信和来访所反映的问题，内容比以前更广泛更深刻，从寻找职业，民事纠纷，婚姻问题，直到检举反革命分子，检举偷税漏税，提出有关市政建设、公共卫生等建议。而勇敢地揭发干部官僚主义、强迫命令和干部的违法乱纪的信件更大为增多。如天津市人民政府去年一月至十月收到批评干部作风的来信共近四百件，平均每月三十九件，十二月份一个月内就收到同类性质的来信一百零四件，激增近两倍。中共唐山地委据五千六百一十九件来信的分类统计，其中检举干部违法乱纪、贪污腐化、违犯政策、立场不稳、压制民主等问题的，有一千二百九十三件，占百分之二十三；检举反革命分子、地主反攻及其他坏分子的不法行为的有一千一百七十五件，约占百分之二十一；对各项工作的批评建议，有七百零一件，占百分之十二强。以上三类，即占来信的半数以上。人民群众和干部的来信，揭发了许多惊人事件，如河北省易县台底村村干部牛洛连欺压群众的事件、原平原省南乐县唐瑞林含冤十年的受辱事件、河北献县对沈东城村群众刘尔岚三次错捕、两次错判的事件，以及天津的杨月辉、河北的郭金升、山西的张三元、米圪斗等多年未得解决的案件，都在群众来信中被揭发出来，并一一获得了适当处理，使各级领导机关得以及早处理坏人坏事。
    群众对自己提出的问题一时得不到解决者，也敢于再三再四地写信催问，进行批评，提出解决的办法，这是和过去大不相同的地方。如河北军粮城机米制造厂工人朱万顺、刘茂隆等四人因“三反”中的问题，不断给华北局来信和打电话催促解决，一次来信写道：“华北局这种对人民负责的精神给我们很大感动，只有努力生产来报答党，希望你们督促河北省委快一点给我们解决。”又一次来信说：“又给你们去一快信，让你们督促有关部门派干部来调查处理，迅速解决。”又说：“再等一个星期看，如果得不到解决，就无论如何要找你们给我们解决。”大同侯玉亭给华北局来信，要“一定派党员干部下来我才放心，希望早点解决”。山海关××工厂一干部王景芳同志来信说：为了“迎接一九五三年的经济建设，请急速派人来解决，千万别往下拖，并给我个回答。”类似这种信件还很多。这些来信一方面充满了对党和政府、特别是对毛主席的信任；同时，也表现敢于理直气壮地提出批评和建议。所有这些，都表明群众主人翁的自觉在不断提高。
    华北各地在去年下半年以后，对群众来信一般能作到迅速及时的处理，积压现象大为减少。在去年所有群众来信的总数中，已处理结案的，华北全区地委以上的党委机关，平均都在百分之六十以上，中共河北邯郸地委为百分之七十六，绥远省公安厅为百分之七十。山西省把处理群众来信作为各界人民代表会议内容之一，成效甚好。中共山西运城地委，去年十月组织了近百名干部进行了全区性大检查，两个月内处理了五百八十八件群众来信，每件都作了妥善处理。河北省有四个地委都根据人民群众来信所揭发的材料举行过一百至二百名干部的检查大会，并分别进行了处理。认真处理群众来信，不仅解除了群众的疾苦，提高了人民的主人感，教育了群众；同时，对所有干部都是极生动、极切实和极深刻的教育，并因此改进了工作，密切了党、政府和人民的联系。华北区的领导机关是把处理人民来信和来访工作当作反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象的一条重要的战线和战斗力量来看待的。华北全区在去年十月以后开展的反官僚主义斗争，都是抓住群众所揭发的典型事件为开端，然后进入普遍的或重点的检查的。这一项工作所以能取得这些成绩，首先是由于华北的领导机关不断地听到毛主席对此项工作是极端重视的，又不断看到毛主席的亲笔批示。华北局办公厅现存档案中即有毛主席亲自批给华北局处理的群众来信二十四件。毛主席的每一批示，对处理群众来信的干部都具有无限鼓舞的力量。其次，华北局第三书记刘澜涛同志，也十分关切此项工作，每天阅读很多群众的重要来信。群众来信揭发出来的几个极重要的案件，都是他亲自给省委、地委负责同志写信嘱办的。他还经常对主办这项工作的同志传达毛主席的精神，指示处理的原则、方法，并检查处理情况。他常说：“这是群众对我们最大的一种帮助，群众通过来信的方法，帮助我们发现问题，教育我们，也鼓舞我们。我们通过这个工作支持人民，鼓舞人民，领导人民勇敢前进。”
    但是，从华北全区说，处理人民来信和接见人民工作还有严重缺点。有很多县甚至更高的领导机关对这一项工作采取错误态度，正如人民日报一月十九日的社论所指出的，有些领导机关不重视群众的这种热情和积极性，不感到本地区官僚主义和违法乱纪现象的严重，不严肃认真地处理人民来信，不和坏人坏事展开坚决的斗争。他们拖拖拉拉，敷衍塞责；或偏听偏信，隐恶扬善；或马马虎虎，失掉原则立场，不与坏人坏事分家。从最近检查的情况看，如包头市铁路工人李春海的母亲，向华北局申诉其子被误为贪污分子一事，华北局于去年八月即责成包头市委查处，但包头市委却又转给绥远省法院处理，迄今尚无结果。河北通县地委尚有华北局一九五一年转去的六件人民来信，搁置未办，其中一件原信，已被地委机关丢失了。更有甚于此者：如河北省清苑县烈属安凤鸣给华北局来信说，曾为房产纠纷，从村到县往返一百一十八回，未得到解决。河北省交河县委会，根本不知道收到和处理过多少群众来信。河北省东光县设的意见箱，三个多月不开，待开箱取信时，已积压群众来信三十余件，这些来信经雨淋都粘在一起，模糊不清了。
    为进一步作好处理群众来信和接见人民来访的工作，华北局于一月十六日召开“处理群众来信，接见人民来访工作座谈会”。参加的有华北行政委员会人民监察委员会、华北局办公厅、华北局纪律检查委员会、最高人民法院华北分院等单位负责同志及有关人员。会议由刘澜涛同志主持。刘澜涛同志对这项工作的性质，作了极详细的阐述：人民来信、来访所揭发的材料，极为可贵，很多是从正式报告中看不到的问题，对我们领导机关启示极大，对继续深入反官僚主义、反强迫命令和反违法乱纪的斗争，是一条有力的战线，是党与政府机关加强与群众联系的重要方法之一。我们的党和政府，只有认真处理的义务，没有搁置不理或马虎应付的权利。因为对人民群众负责是我们的天职。因此，对人民来信、来访要采取竭诚欢迎的态度，认真负责的精神，继续处理下去，不能丝毫马虎。至于少数坏分子敢于利用我们为人民办事的热诚（不过这是极个别的），钻空子，拨弄是非，陷害好人的话，也不要害怕，只要我们注意，是可以弄清楚的。当谈到今后如何具体加强此项工作时，刘澜涛同志除严厉批判有些领导机关不重视此项工作的错误，详细讲述了工作方法、制度等问题外，并着重指出以下两点：第一、要解决各部门之间的分工问题。今后对所有群众来信、来访工作，党委要负责组织、检查，重大事件作典型处理。但日常的函件要尽量转交有关业务部门复办，俾各部门都能通过此项工作与群众发生直接联系，使所有部门的干部，都能了解自己的工作在群众方面引起的反应，并从中受到教育，改进工作。这样做也能适应群众来信、来访日有增加的情况。第二、加强处理群众来信和接见人民来访工作的重要环节在下层机关，特别是县级机关。但不少县的领导机关，处理人民来信的实际情况直到目前仍是令人不能满意的。群众反映“上级好解决问题”，“北京有真理”，正是对我们某些机关、某些干部的严正批评，我们的责任就在于从思想上和具体办法上帮助他们学会处理人民来信和来访的工作。
