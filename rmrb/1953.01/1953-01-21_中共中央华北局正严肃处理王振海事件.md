    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau is Seriously Handling the Wang Zhenhai Incident
    The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau is handling the illegal and discipline-violating actions of Wang Zhenhai, the former Deputy Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee, as exposed in the letter from Fan Wenxing, the former Deputy Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee, published in this newspaper on the 19th, with a serious and responsible attitude. On June 23, 1952, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau received a letter from Fan Wenxing, the former Deputy Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee, reporting Wang Zhenhai's illegal and discipline-violating actions, and immediately notified the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee to investigate and handle the matter seriously and responsibly, and to report the results of the investigation and handling. While cadres of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee were investigating, the North China Bureau received a second letter of accusation from Fan Wenxing on July 18. On the 19th, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau instructed the Hebei Provincial Party Committee to handle the matter responsibly. After investigation and verification by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, it was considered that the situation was complex and difficult to clarify for a time, so it was hastily concluded by means of a "written guarantee." Subsequently, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee considered that Wang Zhenhai's main problems were individualism and subjectivism, and based on this, made an erroneous decision on October 29, deciding to deal with the above-mentioned errors of Wang Zhenhai together with another error of his (investing in private shops to share dividends), and gave him a public warning. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau disagreed with this decision of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, believing that Wang Zhenhai's errors of violating laws and discipline were very serious. Therefore, on January 5, 1953, Wang Zhenhai, Fan Wenxing, Zhang Ying (Wang's lover), Lin Dayu, the current Deputy Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee, Zhou Hongyi, the former Secretary of the Wuji County Party Committee, Zhang Zhichao, the former Director of the Wuji County Public Security Bureau, Li Xiaoliu, the victim, the Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the investigators of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee at that time, and 22 people related to the case were transferred to Beijing for thorough discussion and punishment.

    中共中央华北局正严肃处理王振海事件
    中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会对本报于十九日刊载的中共定县地委前任副书记范文兴来信所揭发的地委书记王振海违法乱纪事件，正以严肃负责的精神进行处理。中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会于一九五二年六月二十三日接到定县地委前任副书记范文兴检举王振海违法乱纪的信件，当即通知河北省委纪律检查委员会严肃负责地调查处理，并将调查处理结果上报。当河北省委纪律检查委员会干部正在调查时，华北局于七月十八日又接到范文兴第二次检举信。华北局纪律检查委员会于十九日又指示河北省委切实负责处理。河北省委经过调查对证，认为情况复杂，一时难以弄清，遂以“具结了案”的方法草草结束。此后，河北省委认为王振海的主要问题是个人主义和主观主义，据此于十月二十九日作出错误决定，决定将王振海的上述错误与他的另一错误一并处理（向私人商店入股分红），给予当众警告处分。华北局纪律检查委员会不同意河北省委这一决定，认为王振海违法乱纪的错误十分严重，乃于一九五三年一月五日，将王振海、范文兴、张英（王的爱人）、现任定县地委副书记林达宇、原无极县委书记周洪毅、原无极县公安局长张志超、受害人李小六、河北省委纪律检查委员会书记及当时河北省委之调查人员，以及与此案有关人员二十二人，先后调来北京彻底议处。
