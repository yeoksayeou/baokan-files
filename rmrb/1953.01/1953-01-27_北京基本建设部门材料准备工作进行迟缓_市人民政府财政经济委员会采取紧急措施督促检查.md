As of now, Beijing's capital construction departments have not actively carried out material preparation work. For materials already allocated, some units have not yet placed orders; even for units that have placed orders, very few have begun transportation. As a result, the city currently has more than 6,000 horse-drawn carts and more than 300 trucks for transporting building materials sitting idle each day, accounting for more than 60 percent of the city's building material transportation capacity. This causes a significant waste of Beijing's already strained transportation capacity and exacerbates transportation difficulties. In response to this situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee has convened a meeting of relevant departments and decided to take the following emergency measures:

One, Require leading cadres of each capital construction department to attach importance to building material preparation work, strengthen material supply organizations and leadership of this work, submit material requirement plans on time, promptly place orders, carry out transportation work, overcome passive waiting, and actively and proactively solve material preparation problems.

Two, For projects where the construction site has been determined, the municipal construction department should promptly submit fund requisition plans for the materials that must be transported immediately, and the finance department should review and pre-allocate a portion of the funds to quickly begin material transportation. For projects carried over from last year that were not completed and new construction projects where the address has been determined, each construction department should also promptly resolve the issue of pre-allocating funds for material preparation within their respective systems and immediately begin material transportation. For projects where the address has not been determined, they should immediately consult with the competent authority to determine it.

Three, Each construction unit should, according to the progress of the project, complete the material preparation plan stipulated by the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee on time. That is, for projects carried over from last year that are planned to be completed in the first half of the year, efforts should be made to transport most of the materials to the construction site before construction begins, and for new construction projects planned to be completed in the second half of the year, efforts should also be made to transport more than 50 percent of the materials to the construction site before construction begins.

In order to implement this decision, the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee recently convened another meeting for inspection, and organized inspection teams to understand the material preparation work and progress in various capital construction departments, urging all units to quickly do a good job in material preparation.

    北京基本建设部门材料准备工作进行迟缓
    市人民政府财政经济委员会采取紧急措施督促检查
    截至目前为止，北京市各基本建设部门还没有积极进行材料准备工作。已经分配的材料，有的单位还没有订货；已经订货的单位，也很少着手运输。因此，目前全市每天闲置的运输建筑材料的马车已有六千多辆、卡车有三百多辆，占全市建筑材料运输力的百分之六十以上。这样，就使北京市本来就供不应求的运输力量遭受很大的浪费，加重了运输工作的困难。北京市人民政府财政经济委员会针对这种情况，已召集有关部门开会，决定采取下列紧急措施：
    一、要求各基本建设部门的领导干部重视建筑材料准备工作，并加强材料供应机构和对这一工作的领导，按时提出材料需用计划，及时进行订货、运输工作，克服消极等待思想，积极主动地解决材料的准备问题。
    二、市政建设部门对已经确定施工地点的工程，应将必须立即运输的材料，迅速提出需款计划，由财政部门审核后预拨一部分款项，迅速开始运料。各建筑部门去年未完成的跨年度工程及已确定地址的新建工程，也应按系统迅速解决预拨备料款项问题，立即开始运料。凡未确定地址的工程，应即商请主管部门确定。
    三、各建筑单位应根据工程进度，按时完成市财委会规定的备料计划，即跨年度工程中计划在上半年完工者，争取在开工前将大部材料运到工地，新建工程计划在下半年完工者，也应争取在开工前将百分之五十以上的材料运到工地。
    为了贯彻执行这个决定，市财委会近又召集会议进行了检查，并组织了检查组到各基本建设部门了解备料工作情况及工作进度，督促各单位迅速做好备料工作。
