    Eisenhower Administration's Expanded Aggression and War Preparation Policy

    Eisenhower officially succeeded Truman as President of the United States on the 20th. As early as during last year's election campaign, Eisenhower and his party had made it clear that they were obsessed with aggression and anti-people causes. Since the election results were announced, the government personnel appointed by Eisenhower and his blatant aggressive deployments and war clamors have further proved that this government, composed of American big capitalists and hawkish military personnel, is preparing to expand aggressive adventures and accelerate the fascistization of the United States.

    Eisenhower's first act after being elected was to actively plan and deploy the expansion of the Korean War. During last year's campaign, Eisenhower had promised voters to end the Korean War quickly. But Eisenhower's trip to Korea last December proved that he did not want to end the war, but to conduct an on-site inspection to prepare for advancing and expanding this war of aggression. He completely abandoned the armistice negotiations and held a series of military meetings in Korea with Clark and Van Fleet, the heads of the US invading forces in Korea, the South Korean puppet president Syngman Rhee, US Pacific Fleet Commander Radford, and Chase, the head of the US military advisory group stationed in the Kuomintang bandit gang. On his way back, Bradley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had accompanied Eisenhower on his inspection of Korea, flew to Pearl Harbor to hold a military summit. After returning to New York, Eisenhower officially declared that he did not want to negotiate but to take "action." Immediately afterwards, he discussed with MacArthur, the executioner who desperately advocated expanding the Korean War, the methods of taking action in Korea.

    The "actions" Eisenhower is planning include: expanding the South Korean puppet army, launching new offensives, blockading the Chinese coast, directing Kuomintang bandits to attack and harass the Chinese mainland, bombing Northeast China, and using atomic weapons, etc. Eisenhower's vicious plans to expand the war and directly invade China have been repeatedly confirmed by the frenzied war cries of major Republican members of the US Congress, such as Senate President Pro Tempore Bridges, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Wiley, Republican Policy Committee Chairman Nolan, House Speaker Martin, and many American military figures.

    In order to make up for the fundamental weakness of insufficient manpower in the United States' aggression, Eisenhower is formulating a so-called "overall strategic plan" for the United States in the Far East. The central idea of this plan is the principle of "using Asians to fight Asians" that Eisenhower himself promoted. The primary goal of the plan is to establish an aggressive bloc in the Pacific region in the style of the North Atlantic Aggression Group, and at the same time, according to MacArthur's suggestion, to organize a so-called "Asian Foreign Legion" as a tool for the United States to carry out military aggression in the Far East. In accordance with Eisenhower's instructions, South Korean puppet Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang bandit gang Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao held talks with Japanese authorities in Tokyo in early January. An Associated Press reporter in Tokyo, Yuson, revealed on the 8th that the purpose of the talks was to
    "form a close alliance between Japan, Korea, and Kuomintang China" as "the first step in establishing an Asian anti-communist united front."

    According to Eisenhower's Far East aggression plan, the United States will also expand its assistance to British and French imperialism in suppressing the wars of national liberation movements in Vietnam and Malaya.

    While planning a full-scale aggressive action in the Far East, the Eisenhower government is also preparing to use tougher means to force its Western European vassal states to step up the implementation of the US-formulated arms expansion and war preparation plan. Eisenhower had arrogantly stated during the campaign: "We should know what to expect from countries that accept US aid." At present, the Eisenhower government and Congress are pressing Western European vassal states in an unprecedentedly blatant manner to promptly ratify the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty centered on arming West Germany. Eisenhower recently personally sent a telegram to West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer, emphasizing the importance of the "European Army" agreement. Then, Wiley, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, who has a huge influence on foreign aid appropriations, gave a speech on the 10th, openly threatening Western European vassals who showed hesitation with cutting US "aid." The next day, Ridgeway, the US commander of the North Atlantic Aggression Army, emphasized again: It is necessary to immediately start increasing West German troops.

    The problem associated with organizing the "European Army" is that the United States wants its Western European vassal states to further abandon national independence and sovereignty. Eisenhower, US Secretary of State Dulles, and others have clearly announced that they will step up the implementation of the so-called "unified Europe" plan that began during Truman's tenure, so as to completely place Western European countries under US control. In a speech on the 15th, Dulles severely criticized Western European countries for "relaxing" their work in this area.

    In order to cooperate with its aggressive war preparation activities in Asia and Europe, the Eisenhower government will also strengthen its offensive against the people of Latin America and the Middle East. Dulles stated at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 15 that the United States "must immediately find a way to deal with" the increasingly developing anti-American national movement in Latin America, and announced that the people's anti-imperialist movements in the Middle East are a "threat" to the United States.

    Eisenhower and Dulles's global aggressive plans have a general goal. That is what Eisenhower stated in his speech to the American Legion convention on August 25 last year: to organize a new "crusade" to completely conquer the countries and people of the peace and democracy camp. Bridges, an important figure in the Eisenhower group, explained in an article published in the "American Mercury" monthly magazine in November last year the "world policy" that the Republican government wants to promote. He openly said: "This policy has a clearly declared purpose, which is to ultimately disarm the communists."

    As a means of realizing this rampant plan, in addition to direct military aggression, Dulles recently reiterated that he would step up war propaganda, step up espionage, sabotage, and inciting counter-revolutionary rebellion against the peace and democracy camp. In this regard, Dulles cited the betrayal of the Tito bandit gang as the "best example." The US State Department will become the center for further instigating international espionage and sabotage activities. US spy chief Walter Bedell Smith, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has been appointed as Deputy Secretary of State. According to a report in the "New York Times" on the 11th, Eisenhower also decided to establish a committee specializing in so-called "psychological warfare," chaired by Smith's deputy, William Jackson, deputy director of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff.

    The global aggression plan that American billionaires are stepping up through Republican agents is inseparable from the acceleration of militarization in the United States itself. "U.S. News & World Report," a magazine of American monopoly capital related to the Republican Party, expressed satisfaction after Eisenhower was first elected last year, saying: "After the Eisenhower government takes office... the expansion of armaments will still be a huge new permanent industry."

    According to the claims Eisenhower announced during the campaign and reports in the American bourgeois press, the new government guarantees capitalists greater "freedom" to extract profits, while also reducing taxes on large enterprises. Controls on enterprises will be lifted, but wages still need to be frozen. Eisenhower himself stated that the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law cannot be repealed, and now Republican legislators are preparing to modify it to be even more severe, to prohibit the current collective bargaining contract methods in enterprises, and to restrict national strikes.

    In order to further clear the way for the fascistization of the United States, American reactionaries have stirred up more frenzied anti-Soviet and anti-communist hysteria at home, stepped up the persecution of communists, progressives, and all peace-loving people, as well as the entire labor movement. Reactionary congressmen are fanatically clamoring for more brutal treatment of American progressive citizens. The "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee" even asked Congress to give them "wartime" powers so that they can arbitrarily sentence innocent people to death. Republican new government Attorney General Brownell, who was "borrowed" by Eisenhower from the famous reactionary Dewey during the campaign to preside over the campaign activities, announced to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the 19th that he would "actively implement" anti-communist laws, and said that he already "has important plans to strengthen anti-communist work."

    However, the new government in Washington, despite its arrogance, cannot change the difficult situation it inherited from the Truman government.

    First of all, on the issue of the Korean War, Eisenhower's conspiracy to continue and expand the war will be met with heavier blows from the increasingly stronger Korean and Chinese People's troops. "Life" magazine recently analyzed every path Eisenhower was planning, concluding: "No road is without danger."

    At the same time, the American people's dissatisfaction with the Korean War is continuing to grow. The call of American mothers "Save our sons!" has become increasingly strong. American newspapers recently, in commenting on the mass desertions of soldiers, could not help but admit: American youths are simply unwilling to be cannon fodder, American parents would rather have them desert, and the American people hate the Korean War. This situation of popular alienation has doomed Eisenhower and his hawkish group's conspiracy to expand aggression to bankruptcy.

    In Western Europe and other regions, the American offensive against the national independence and sovereignty of various countries has been met with increasingly strong resistance from the people of various countries. Not only that, but quarrels between the United States and various countries are intensifying. On the first day of 1953, the US Associated Press lamented that "direct conflicts between Western military and political leaders have developed." Recently, Dulles also admitted that the North Atlantic Group is experiencing "a process of disintegration." Eisenhower's plan to step up the oppression and exploitation of vassal states will only exacerbate this resistance and contradiction.

    More importantly, the American economic crisis is maturing. The Truman Presidential Economic Advisory Committee's report trumpeted the current
    "prosperity," but even the Economic Advisory Committee itself has sharp disagreements on the next step in economic development. A portion of the committee, including committee chairman Leon Keyserling, admitted that unless effective measures are taken, they will enter a "deflationary crisis."

    After "U.S. News & World Report" magazine comprehensively calculated the domestic and foreign situation of the United States for the newly elected President Eisenhower, it made a gloomy conclusion: "Wherever Eisenhower goes, he may fall into difficulties." This is an understatement. The problem is by no means just "difficulties." In the face of the increasingly turbulent wave of people all over the world opposing war and demanding peace, and in the face of the unprecedentedly strong strength and resolute will to defend peace of the peace and democracy camp, the aggressive and anti-people conspiracy of a handful of American adventurers headed by Eisenhower,
    will inevitably suffer even greater failures than the Truman government has already suffered.

    艾森豪威尔政府的扩大侵略和备战政策
    艾森豪威尔于二十日正式接替杜鲁门就任美国总统。早在去年竞选期间，艾森豪威尔及其伙党就已表明他们醉心于侵略和反人民的事业。大选揭晓以后，艾森豪威尔任命的政府人员和他所进行的露骨的侵略部署和战争叫嚣，进一步证明了这个由美国大资本家和好战军人组成的政府正在准备扩大侵略冒险并使美国加速度地法西斯化。
    艾森豪威尔当选后的第一件事情就是积极策划和布置扩大朝鲜战争。在去年竞选期间，艾森豪威尔曾对选民许下了迅速结束朝鲜战争的诺言。但是艾森豪威尔去年十二月的朝鲜之行证明他并不是要结束战争，而是去实地视察，准备推进和扩大这个侵略战争。他完全丢开了停战谈判，在朝鲜和侵朝美军首脑克拉克和范佛里特、南朝鲜傀儡总统李承晚、美国太平洋舰队总司令雷德弗、美国派在国民党匪帮中的军事顾问团团长蔡斯等人举行了一系列的军事会议。在归途中，曾伴同艾森豪威尔前往朝鲜视察的美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷又飞到珍珠港召开军事首脑会议。艾森豪威尔在回到纽约后就正式声明：他不想进行谈判而要采取“行动”。紧接着，他又和竭力鼓吹扩大朝鲜战争的刽子手麦克阿瑟商谈了在朝鲜采取行动的方法。
    艾森豪威尔所计议的“行动”，已透露的有：扩大南朝鲜傀儡军队，发动新的进攻，封锁中国海岸，指使国民党匪帮袭击和骚扰中国大陆，轰炸我国东北，以及使用原子武器等等。艾森豪威尔的这些扩大战争和直接侵略中国的凶恶打算，在美国国会的共和党主要议员如参议院的临时议长勃里奇、外交委员会主席维利、共和党政策委员会主席诺兰、众议院议长马丁等人和许多美国军界人士的狂热的战争叫嚣中已经一再得到证实。
    为了弥补美国进行侵略时人力不足的根本弱点，艾森豪威尔正在制订一个美国在远东方面的所谓“全盘战略计划”，这个计划的中心思想就是艾森豪威尔自己宣扬过的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的原则。计划的首要目标是按照北大西洋侵略集团的式样成立一个太平洋区域的侵略集团，同时依照麦克阿瑟的建议组织所谓“亚洲外籍军团”，作为美国在远东进行军事侵略的工具。遵照艾森豪威尔的旨意，南朝鲜傀儡李承晚和国民党匪帮外交部长叶公超在一月上旬已先后和日本当局在东京举行会谈，美联社东京记者尤松八日透露，会谈的目的就是要
    “由日本、朝鲜与国民党中国结成密切的联盟”，作为“成立亚洲反共联合阵线的第一步”。
    根据艾森豪威尔的远东侵略计划，美国还要扩大帮助英法帝国主义进行镇压越南、马来亚民族解放运动的战争。
    艾森豪威尔政府在策划远东全面侵略行动的同时，也准备用更强硬的手段迫使西欧仆从国家加紧推行美国所制订的扩军备战计划。艾森豪威尔在竞选中就曾经蛮横地表示过：“我们应当知道对接受美援的国家期待些什么。”目前，艾森豪威尔政府和国会方面正在以空前露骨的方式压迫西欧仆从国家从速批准以武装西德为中心的所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约。艾森豪威尔最近亲自打电报给西德傀儡总理阿登纳，强调“欧洲军”协定的重要性。接着，在援外拨款问题上有巨大影响的参议院外交委员会的主席维利在十日发表谈话，公开对表现犹豫的西欧仆从以削减美“援”进行威胁。第二天，北大西洋侵略军的美国司令李奇微又着重表示：必须立即开始增加西德军队。
    和组织“欧洲军”相连带的问题，就是美国要西欧各仆从国家进一步放弃国家独立和主权。艾森豪威尔、美国新国务卿杜勒斯等人已明白宣布将加紧推行杜鲁门任内开始的所谓“统一欧洲”的计划，以便把西欧各国完全置于美国的控制之下。杜勒斯在十五日的谈话中严厉斥责西欧各国“松弛”了这方面的工作。
    为了配合它在亚洲和欧洲的侵略备战活动，艾森豪威尔政府还要加强对拉丁美洲和中东人民的进攻。杜勒斯一月十五日在美国国会参议院外交委员会会议上表示：美国“必须马上设法对付”拉丁美洲愈来愈发展的反美民族运动，并且宣布中东人民的反对帝国主义的人民运动是对美国的“威胁”。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在全世界范围内所布置的侵略计划有一个总的目标。那就是艾森豪威尔在去年八月二十五日对美国退伍军人团大会演说中所表明的：组织新的“十字军”，完全征服和平民主阵营的国家和人民。艾森豪威尔集团的重要角色勃里奇在他发表在去年十一月间的“美国信使”月刊上的文章中曾经解释共和党政府所要推行的“世界政策”，他公开地说：“这个政策有一个明白宣布的目的，就是最后要解除共产党的武装。”
    作为实现这个猖狂计划的手段，除了直接军事侵略以外，杜勒斯最近再度表明要加紧战争宣传，加紧进行对和平民主阵营的间谍、特务破坏活动和煽动反革命叛乱，在这方面，杜勒斯举出铁托匪帮的背叛作为“最好的例子”。美国国务院将成为进一步策动国际间谍破坏活动的中心，美国特务头子、中央情报局局长华尔特·贝德尔·史密斯已被委任为副国务卿。据“纽约时报”十一日报道，艾森豪威尔还决定设立专门从事所谓“心理作战”的委员会，由史密斯的副手、参谋部情报处副处长威廉·杰克逊担任主席。
    美国亿万富翁通过共和党代理人来加紧推行的全球侵略计划是和加速美国本国军国主义化分不开的。与共和党有关系的美国垄断资本的杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”在去年艾森豪威尔刚当选以后就表示满意说：“在艾森豪威尔政府上台以后……扩充军备将仍然是一项巨大的新的永久性的工业。”
    根据艾森豪威尔在竞选中宣布的主张和美国资产阶级报刊的报道，新政府保证给资本家以榨取利润的更大“自由”，同时还要减低对大企业的征税。对企业的管制将予取消，但工资仍需冻结。艾森豪威尔自己表示过，塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法案不能废除，而且现在共和党的议员已在准备把它修改得更加严厉，要禁止企业中现行的集体谈判合同的办法，并限制全国性的罢工。
    为了替美国的法西斯化进一步扫清道路，美国反动派已在国内煽起更疯狂的反苏反共歇斯底里，加紧迫害共产党、进步分子和一切爱好和平人士以及整个工人运动。反动议员们狂热地叫嚣着要更残酷地对待美国的进步公民，“非美活动调查委员会”甚至要求国会给以“战时”权力，使他们可以任意把无辜者判处死刑。共和党新政府的司法部长布朗纳尔是艾森豪威尔在竞选时从著名反动分子杜威那里“借来”主持竞选活动的亲信，他十九日在参议院司法委员会上宣布，他要把反共法律“积极付诸实施”，并说他已“有加强反共工作的重要计划”。
    但是，华盛顿的新政府尽管嚣张，却并不能改变他们从杜鲁门政府继承下来的困难处境。
    首先在朝鲜战争问题上，艾森豪威尔继续和扩大战争的阴谋将遭到愈战愈强的朝中人民部队的更沉重的打击。美国“生活”周刊最近分析了艾森豪威尔策划中的每一条道路，结论是：“没有一条路不带有危险。”
    同时，美国人民对于朝鲜战争的不满情绪正在继续增长。美国母亲们“拯救我们的儿子！”的呼声已日益强烈。美国报纸最近在评论士兵大量逃亡时不能不承认：美国青年根本不愿当炮灰，美国父母宁愿他们逃亡，美国人民憎恨朝鲜战争。这种民心背离的情况使艾森豪威尔及其好战集团扩大侵略的阴谋注定要破产。
    在西欧和其他地区，美国对各国民族独立和主权的进攻受到各国人民日益强烈的反抗。不仅如此，美国和各国之间的争吵正在加剧。在一九五三年的第一天，美国的合众社就叹息“西方军事与政治领袖之间的直接冲突发展了”。最近，杜勒斯也承认北大西洋集团正经历“一个分崩离析的过程”。艾森豪威尔要加紧对仆从国家压迫和榨取，只会更加剧这种反抗和矛盾。
    更重要的是美国的经济危机正在成熟。杜鲁门的总统经济顾问委员会的报告尽管大事吹嘘目前的
    “繁荣”，但是就连经济顾问委员会本身对经济发展的下一步意见也发生尖锐的分歧。包括委员会的主席利昂·凯塞林在内，一部分委员承认除非采取有效办法，否则就要进入“通货紧缩的危机”。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在替新当选总统的艾森豪威尔通盘盘算了一下美国在国内外处境以后，作了一个阴沉的结论：“不论艾森豪威尔走到哪里都可能要陷入困难。”这是减轻了的说法。问题决不只是“困难”而已。在全世界人民反对战争要求和平的日益汹涌的巨浪面前，在和平民主阵营空前壮大的力量和保卫和平的坚决意志面前，以艾森豪威尔为首的一小撮美国冒险家的侵略反人民的阴谋，
    一定要遭到比杜鲁门政府已经遭到的更大的失败。
