    Implementing the safety production policy and doing a good job in labor protection
    On the eve of the nation's large-scale economic construction, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government convened the National Labor Protection Work Conference. This is very timely and necessary. Because strengthening labor protection is a necessary condition to ensure the smooth development of economic construction.
    In the past three years, thanks to the firm implementation of the labor protection policy by the Communist Party and the People's Government and the joint efforts of all relevant parties, the labor protection work of state-owned factories and mines has made great achievements. The one-sided view of "emphasizing production only and neglecting safety" and the bureaucratic style have been continuously criticized and corrected; while restoring and developing production, safety and health equipment have been greatly improved; relevant safety and health regulations and systems have been basically established; in particular, all regions and cities have carried out several major safety and health inspections or key inspections under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. These have played a significant role in the construction of labor protection work, enabled cadres and the masses to receive practical safety production education, promoted the mass safety production movement, and produced many safety production inventions and model deeds. All of this has greatly changed the safety and health conditions of factories and mines, greatly reduced casualties, and further enhanced the production enthusiasm of the workers. However, these achievements are not yet solid, and there is a great imbalance between regions, factories and mines, and industries. Some are doing well, while others are doing very poorly. Accidents and casualties continue to occur, and diseases are still quite serious. After the launch of the increased production and economy campaign last year, the workers' enthusiasm for production soared, but labor protection work did not keep up in time, resulting in an increasing trend of accidents and casualties in some industries and regions, especially in highway construction, capital construction, and forestry. This situation, which is harmful to the safety and health of workers and to the cause of production and construction, is intolerable. All relevant parties, especially the industrial management departments, must pay serious attention to this and earnestly strengthen labor protection work.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "While implementing increased production and economy, we must pay attention to the safety, health, and essential welfare of employees; it is wrong to only pay attention to the former and forget or neglect the latter." This means that in people's enterprises, production and safety are an inseparable and unified whole. Countless facts in the past three years have proved this basic principle. For example, the heat treatment workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory improved ventilation equipment, thus increasing productivity by 65 percent; the Dalian Chemical Plant used less than one ton of stainless steel to make a nitric acid gas recovery device, eliminating acute occupational diseases, and at the same time producing three to five tons of sodium nitrite per day. On the contrary, the Xi'an Fuguo Mine, because the leadership did not understand the principle of safe production, insisted on continuing production when the gas was full, resulting in a major gas explosion accident that killed and injured 49 people, and failed to complete the 1952 production plan. There are many such examples. However, some factory and mine employees have not yet understood these serious lessons, and still hold the harmful view of "emphasizing production only and neglecting safety," saying things like "accidents are minor matters, failing to complete the task is a major matter," "rather commit a small mistake than a big mistake," "the factory is a battlefield, and casualties are inevitable," and so on. Such a statement, which opposes safety and production, is tantamount to defending bureaucracy and should be severely criticized. Therefore, this labor protection conference takes "implementing the idea of safe production" as the general guideline, and determines the principle of "production must be safe, safety is for production, the two are one and indivisible." This is entirely correct.
    The way to realize this policy is, first, to incorporate the idea of safe production into the plan. This means that the idea of safe production should be specifically embodied in the enterprise's production plan, financial plan, capital construction plan, and various plans for daily work. At the same time, each enterprise unit should earnestly check the safety and health conditions of its own enterprise, find the key problems, and try to solve them according to necessity and possibility. Those that cannot be solved immediately should be planned and solved gradually. The second is to implement the idea of safe production into the system, which is to turn the view of safe production into a system and become an indispensable part of the entire business management system. All planning production, deploying tasks, inspecting work, and educating cadres must take safety issues as one of the main items. At the same time, special attention should be paid to establishing and improving safety regulations and systems, and submitting existing regulations and systems to the masses for review and revision to make them practical and feasible. The third is to implement the idea of safe production into the masses, which is to make the idea of safe production mastered by the masses. Experience tells us that leadership attention is the decisive link in safe production; but if the leadership is not combined with the masses, the principle of safe production is difficult to implement. Enterprise administration and trade unions must earnestly and systematically conduct safety education for all workers and staff (especially new workers). Only when the masses understand the principles of safe production and are familiar with the safety regulations and systems can everyone check, supervise and improve at any time. The fourth is to implement the idea of safe production into discipline, which means that clear regulations should be stipulated, those who do well in safe production work should be commended and rewarded; those who do not do well should be criticized; and if responsibility accidents occur, responsibility must be investigated and dealt with. Earnestly implement the above four points to make the idea of safe production planned, systematized, mass-based, and disciplined, so that safe production can gradually become the conscious creed of all workers and staff, become a habit of life, and be guaranteed to be realized.
    The experience of the past three years shows that conducting major safety and health inspections is a very good way to strengthen labor protection work. The industrial management departments and all regions should earnestly study these valuable experiences and formulate methods for future inspections based on specific circumstances. The shortcomings of some regions in this regard in the past are only sudden campaigns and no regular work. As the workers say: "It is lively when inspecting, and deserted when the inspection is over." Although individual problems have been solved, major and complex problems have been put aside and no one has dealt with them. In order to correct this shortcoming, the industrial management organs and all factories and mines must strengthen the special labor protection agencies. Factory and mine units should have a factory director or deputy factory director responsible for labor protection work; at the same time, they should be equipped with certain technical personnel or technical workers as full-time cadres. Otherwise, labor protection work cannot be regularized.
    In private enterprises, the policy of safe production should also be earnestly implemented. In the past three years, thanks to the leadership of the People's Government, the supervision of trade union organizations, and the efforts of some progressive industrialists and businessmen, the safety and health conditions in private enterprises have also made some progress; but they are much behind state-owned enterprises, and accidents and casualties are much more serious. The basic reason is that the idea of "only valuing machines and not valuing people," that is, the idea of "as long as workers work, they don't care whether workers live or die," still exists seriously. This situation is obviously contrary to the spirit of the Common Program, is not allowed by the People's Government, and is also detrimental to the enterprise itself. Many facts in the past three years have proved that the practice of "combining production and safety" in private enterprises is not only beneficial to the labor side, but also beneficial to the capital side. For example, the Shanghai Huayuan Dye Factory, under the supervision of the trade union, spent more than 10 million yuan to improve the vulcanized blue production process and strengthen safety equipment, and accidents and casualties gradually decreased. In July 1951, the factory had 20 accidents, and by November, they were completely eliminated; and production increased from 70% in July to 230% in November; the capital side also gained increased production profits of 300 million yuan in four months. On the contrary, some private yarn factories are unwilling to spend money to improve ventilation equipment, so that workers often work in high temperatures, diseases are frequent, and productivity is naturally very low. Some private enterprises do not pay attention to worker safety and purchase old boilers for use, resulting in explosion accidents (such as Jiangsu Hengxing Oil Factory and Zigong City Furu Well), which caused many worker casualties and great losses to enterprise property. There are many similar events. All private entrepreneurs should deeply understand these lessons, and automatically improve safety and health equipment based on the principle of labor-capital benefit. At the same time, local labor bureaus and trade union organizations should strengthen inspections and supervision of private enterprises, so that the state's laws on protecting labor can be effectively implemented, and all possible improvements can be made to workers' working conditions to achieve the goal of safe production and labor-capital benefit.
    Labor protection is a long-term and continuously developing work. Production moves forward one step, and labor protection work must also develop one step. Production technology is changing with each passing day, and safety facilities must also change with each passing day. We cadres who do labor protection work have a major shortcoming, that is, we not only lack such scientific knowledge, but also have very little experience. This requires us to study hard, learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the workers, and learn from everyone who understands, and transform from laymen to experts in order to do this work better.
    The large-scale economic construction has already begun. The industrial management departments, labor administrative departments, trade union organizations, and all workers and staff must work together to overcome the current weakness that labor protection work lags behind the development of production and lags behind the enthusiasm of the workers, so as to ensure the smooth development of the large-scale economic construction.

### 贯彻安全生产方针，做好劳动保护工作

    贯彻安全生产方针，做好劳动保护工作
    在国家进行大规模经济建设的前夜，中央人民政府劳动部召开了全国劳动保护工作会议。这是很适时的和必要的。因为加强劳动保护工作是保证经济建设顺利开展的必要条件。
    三年来，由于共产党和人民政府坚决贯彻保护劳动的政策和各有关方面的共同努力，国营厂矿企业的劳动保护工作取得了很大成绩。“只重生产，忽视安全”的片面观点和官僚主义作风，受到了不断的批判和纠正；在恢复与发展生产的同时，安全卫生设备已有不少改善；有关安全卫生的规程制度已经基本建立起来；特别是各地区各城市在各级党委领导下进行了多次安全卫生大检查或重点检查。这些对于劳动保护工作的建设，起了重大作用，使干部和群众都受到切实的安全生产教育，推动了群众的安全生产运动，出现了许多安全生产的创造发明和模范事迹。这一切都使厂矿企业的安全卫生状况大为改观，伤亡事故大大减少，工人群众的生产积极性因之更加提高。但是，这些成绩还不巩固，各地区、各厂矿、各产业之间还很不平衡，有的作得较好，有的作得还很差，伤亡事故还不断发生，疾病现象还相当严重。在去年增产节约运动开展后，工人生产热情空前高涨，劳动保护工作却没有及时赶上去，以致在某些产业和地区伤亡事故又有增加的趋势，特别是在公路建筑、基本建设和林业中更为严重。这种既有害于工人安全健康，又有害于生产建设事业的情形，是不能容忍的。各有关方面，首先是各产业管理部门必须予以严重的注意，切实加强劳动保护工作。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在实施增产节约的同时，必须注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业；如果只注意前一方面，忘记或忽视后一方面，都是错误的。”这就是说，在人民企业中生产与安全是不可分离的统一的整体。三年来无数事实都证明了这一基本原则。例如：沈阳机器一厂的热处理车间，改善了通风设备，生产率因此提高了百分之六十五；大连化学厂用不到一吨的不锈钢做硝酸气的回收装置，消灭了急性职业病，同时每天可产生亚硝酸钠三吨至五吨。相反的，西安富国矿由于领导上没有懂得安全生产的原则，在瓦斯满灯的情况下仍坚持要继续生产，结果发生了死伤四十九人的重大瓦斯爆炸事故，并使一九五二年的生产计划没有完成。这样的例子是不少的。可是，有些厂矿企业的工作人员，至今没有了解这些严重教训，依然存在着“只重生产，忽视安全”的有害观点，说什么
    “出事故是小事，完不成任务是大事”，“宁犯小错，不犯大错”，“工厂是战场，难免不有伤亡”等等。这种把安全与生产对立起来的说法，无异是替官僚主义辩护，是应当受到严厉批判的。因此，这次劳动保护会议以“贯彻安全生产的思想”为总方针，确定“生产必须安全，安全为了生产，两位一体，不能分割”的原则。这是完全正确的。
    实现这个方针的办法，第一是要把安全生产的思想贯彻到计划中去。这就是说，要把安全生产的思想具体地体现在企业的生产计划、财务计划、基本建设计划以及日常工作的各种计划中去。同时，每个企业单位都应当切实检查自己企业的安全卫生状况，找出关键问题，根据必要和可能，努力设法解决，不能立即解决的应该订成计划，逐步解决。第二是要把安全生产的思想贯彻到制度中去，这就是要将安全生产的观点变为制度，成为整个经营管理制度的不可缺少的组成部分。举凡计划生产、布置任务、检查工作、教育干部，都要把安全问题作为
    一个主要项目之一。同时要特别注意建立健全的安全规程制度，将已有的规程制度，交给群众审查修正，使它切实可行。第三是要把安全生产思想贯彻到群众中去，这就是使安全生产思想为群众所掌握。经验告诉我们，领导重视是安全生产的决定环节；但如果领导不与群众结合，安全生产的原则就很难贯彻。企业行政和工会，必须认真地、系统地对全体工人职员（特别是对新工人）进行安全教育。只有群众懂得了安全生产的道理，熟悉了安全规程制度，大家才能随时检查，随时监督和改进。第四是要把安全生产思想贯彻到纪律中去，这就是说，要规定明确的制度，对安全生产工作做得好的要表扬、奖励；对不好的要批评；发生责任事故，必须追究责任，予以处分。切实执行上述四点，使安全生产思想计划化、制度化、群众化、纪律化，便能使安全生产逐渐成为全体工人职员的自觉信条，成为生活习惯，而有实现的保证。
    三年来的经验说明，进行安全卫生大检查是加强劳动保护工作的很好办法。各产业管理部门和各地区，都应切实研究这些宝贵的经验，根据具体情况，定出今后进行检查的办法。过去有些地区在这方面的缺点是只有突击性的运动，没有经常工作。正如工人群众所说：“检查的时候轰轰烈烈，检查一过去冷冷清清。”个别的问题虽然解决了，重大的复杂的问题却搁置起来无人处理。为了纠正这个缺点，各产业管理机关和各厂矿企业都必须加强专管劳动保护的机构。厂矿企业单位应有厂长或副厂长
    一人负责劳动保护工作；同时要配备一定的技术人员或技术工人为专职干部。不这样就不能使劳动保护工作经常化。
    在私营企业方面，同样应该切实执行安全生产的方针。三年来，由于人民政府的领导，工会组织的督促，以及某些进步工商业者的努力，在私营企业中的安全卫生状况也有一些进步；但较国营企业则落后得多，伤亡事故也就严重得多。基本原因是在于“只重视机器，不重视人”的思想，即工人所说的“只要工人干活，不管工人死活”的思想，仍然严重存在。这种情况显然与共同纲领的精神相违背，是人民政府所不能容许的，同时也是对企业本身不利的。三年来不少的事实证明，在私营企业中实行“生产与安全结合”的作法，不仅对劳方有利，而且也对资方有利。例如，上海市华元染料厂在工会督促下，拿了一千多万元改善硫化蓝生产过程，加强了安全设备，伤亡事故就逐渐减少。一九五一年七月份，该厂发生了二十次事故，到十一月份便完全消灭了；而生产则自七月份的百分之七十提高至十一月份的百分之二百三十；资方在四个月中也就获得增产利润三亿元。与此相反，有些私营纱厂不肯拿钱改善通风设备，使工人常在高温下工作，疾病频繁，生产率自然很低。有些私营企业不重视工人安全，购买破旧锅炉使用，结果发生爆炸事故（如江苏恒兴油厂、自贡市福如井），使工人伤亡很多，企业财产的损失也很大。类似这样的事件是很多的。所有私营企业主都应当深刻领会这些教训，本着劳资两利的原则，自动改善安全卫生设备。同时，各地劳动局和工会组织应加强对私营企业的检查和监督，使国家保护劳动的法令能切实贯彻，对工人劳动条件作一切可能的改善，以达到安全生产、劳资两利的目的。
    劳动保护是一项长期的不断向前发展的工作。生产向前发展一步，劳动保护工作也就要随着发展一步。生产技术日新月异，安全设施也要随着日新月异。我们做劳动保护工作的干部有一个重大的缺点，就是不仅缺乏这样的科学知识，而且经验很少。这就必须努力学习，向苏联学习，向工人群众学习，向一切懂得的人学习，由外行变成内行，才能把这个工作做得更好。
    大规模的经济建设事业已经开始了。各产业管理部门、劳动行政部门、工会组织以及全体工人职员，必须协同一致，努力克服目前劳动保护工作落后于生产发展、落后于工人群众生产积极性的弱点，以保证大规模经济建设事业的顺利开展。
