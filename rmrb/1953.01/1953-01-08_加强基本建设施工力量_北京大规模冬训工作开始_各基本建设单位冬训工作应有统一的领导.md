    Strengthen Basic Construction Construction Force
    Large-Scale Winter Training Work Begins in Beijing
    Winter Training Work of Various Basic Construction Units Should Have Unified Leadership
    [Our Newspaper] Beijing's basic construction units have begun large-scale winter training work, with more than 40,000 workers and cadres participating in the training.
    At the end of October last year, Beijing's basic construction units began preparing for winter training. At that time, more than 20,000 workers were fixed from temporary workers as long-term workers. In mid-November, various basic construction units established winter training work committees to specifically lead the training work. At the end of November last year, the Beijing Construction Engineering Company concentrated more than 200 people to run a "Winter Training Counselor Training Class." The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also specially equipped the Beijing Construction Company with 45 teachers and counselors. According to Beijing's experience, before the winter training work begins, it is necessary to first understand the workers' understanding and requirements for winter training. Before winter training, the engineering company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Beijing Construction Company organized working groups to conduct in-depth investigations of workers' thoughts on the spot, and learned that the vast majority of workers were willing to learn. For example, plasterer Li Yin said to the working group cadres: "If you don't study politics and technology well, you can't make progress. The workmates who participated in the study last year are much more advanced in their thinking than us!" However, some workers said that they only wanted to learn technology and were unwilling to study politics. They believe: "Studying politics is useless; studying technology is useful." In addition, some workers wanted to go home and were unwilling to study. In order to solve these ideological problems, the leading cadres of these units specially convened workers' meetings and repeatedly explained the importance of winter training work. Before the winter training, the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company generally carried out winter training mobilization, which solved many ideological problems among workers. Before winter training, the Beijing Construction Company specially discussed the relationship between winter training and large-scale economic construction, so that workers could settle down and study.
    Secondly, before winter training, it is necessary to clarify the thinking of cadres. At first, some cadres had inconsistent understanding of the winter training policy. Some believed that these workers had not received systematic political education in the past, so winter training should focus on political education and supplemented by technical education. Others believed that this year's construction tasks were too heavy, and if technical education was not the main focus and the technical level of workers was not rapidly improved, it would be difficult to complete this year's heavy basic construction tasks. The Beijing basic construction units explained these different views of cadres, so that everyone clearly realized that the winter training work should adopt the policy of "equal emphasis on political education and technical education"; and roughly stipulated that political education should be carried out for more than 30 days before the Spring Festival, and technical education should be carried out for more than 30 days after the Spring Festival. Before the start of winter training, many cadres did not pay attention to winter training work, thinking that "after being busy for a year, it's time to take a rest." Some cadres also emphasized that their culture was low and they could not do winter training work. To this end, the Beijing basic construction units conducted ideological education for cadres separately. The engineering company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Beijing Construction Company held cadre meetings to explain the important relationship between winter training work and this year's basic construction tasks. A small number of units did not pay attention to solving the ideological problems of cadres, and after the start of winter training work, the work enthusiasm of cadres was not high, which affected the progress of the work.
    The winter training work of Beijing's basic construction units has begun. However, there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. At present, the units conducting winter training work in Beijing include the engineering company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the engineering company directly under the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the civil engineering construction company of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Electric Power Management Bureau, the construction department of the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade, the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company, and the Beijing Construction Company. The winter training work of these units is carried out separately, with decentralized leadership, unconcentrated strength, inconsistent practices, and teachers and counselors cannot be transferred and used. Therefore, unifying the leadership of winter training work in Beijing's basic construction is the first problem that needs to be solved. Secondly, some units do not have enough teachers and counselors, and the quality is also very poor. For example, in order to find teachers, the engineering company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering consulted eight or nine agencies, but all failed. This urgently requires all relevant agencies to provide strong support and help these units solve the problem of the lack of teachers and counselors. In addition, the workers of some units have low learning enthusiasm because they do not eat well and live well, and the teachers and counselors of some units do not have working tables and chairs, etc., which must be solved in time.

### 加强基本建设施工力量  北京大规模冬训工作开始  各基本建设单位冬训工作应有统一的领导

    加强基本建设施工力量
    北京大规模冬训工作开始
    各基本建设单位冬训工作应有统一的领导
    【本报讯】北京各基本建设单位已经开始进行大规模的冬季训练工作，参加训练的有四万多名工人和干部。
    去年十月底，北京各基本建设单位就开始进行冬训的准备工作，当时从临时工人中固定了两万多工人作为长期工人。十一月中旬，各基本建设单位分别成立了冬训工作委员会，专门领导训练工作。北京市建筑工程公司在去年十一月底，集中了二百多人，开办了“冬训辅导员训练班”，中国共产党北京市委员会还专门给北京市建筑公司配备了四十五名教员和辅导员。根据北京的经验，在冬训工作开始以前，应该首先摸清工人对冬训的认识和要求。中央建筑工程部直属工程公司和北京市建筑公司都在冬训以前组织工作组，深入现场调查工人的思想情况，了解到绝大多数工人都是愿意学习的。如抹灰工李荫对工作组干部说：“不好好学习政治和技术，就不能进步。去年参加学习的工友，比咱们的思想进步多啦！”但是，有些工人表示只愿意学技术，不愿意学政治。他们认为：“学了政治，没有用；学了技术，能顶用。”此外，还有些工人想回家，不愿学习。这些单位的领导干部为了解决这些思想问题，专门召集了工人开会，反复说明冬训工作的重要性。华北基本建设工程公司在冬训以前，普遍进行冬训动员，解决了工人中许多思想问题。北京市建筑公司在冬训前，专门讨论了冬训和大规模经济建设的关系的问题，使工人能够安定下来，进行学习。
    其次，在冬训以前，必须打通干部思想。起初有些干部对冬训方针的认识不一致。有的以为这些工人过去没有受过系统的政治教育，因此，冬训应以政治教育为主，技术教育为辅。有的却认为今年的建筑任务太重，如果不以技术教育为主，不迅速提高工人的技术水平，将很难完成今年繁重的基本建设任务。北京市各基本建设单位针对干部这些不同的看法，进行了解释，使大家明确地认识到冬训工作应采取“政治教育和技术教育并重”的方针；并大体上规定：在春节前三十多天进行政治教育，春节后三十多天进行技术教育。在冬训工作开始以前，不少的干部不重视冬训工作，他们以为“忙了一年，该休息一下了”。有些干部还强调自己的文化低，不能做冬训工作。为此，北京市各基本建设单位分别对干部进行了思想教育。中央建筑工程部直属工程公司和北京市建筑公司曾召开干部会议，讲明冬训工作对今年基本建设任务的重大关系。有少数单位因为没有注意解决干部的思想问题，在冬训工作开始以后，干部工作情绪不高，影响到工作的进行。
    北京各基本建设单位的冬训工作都已开始了。但是还有一些问题亟待解决。目前，在北京进行冬训工作的有中央重工业部工程公司、中央建筑工程部直属工程公司、中央燃料工业部电业管理总局土木建筑公司、中央对外贸易部建筑部门、华北基本建设工程公司、北京市建筑公司等单位。这些单位的冬训工作都是分别进行的，领导分散，力量不集中，做法不统一，教员和辅导员不能调剂使用。因此，统一北京各基本建设冬训工作的领导，是首先需要解决的问题。其次，有些单位的教员和辅导员还不够，同时质量也很差。例如中央建筑工程部直属工程公司为了找教员，曾向八、九个机关商量，结果都落了空。这就迫切要求各有关机关大力支援，帮助这些单位解决教员和辅导员缺少的问题。此外，某些单位的工人因为吃不好、住不好，学习情绪不高，某些单位的教员和辅导员没有工作的桌子和椅子等问题，都必需及时解决。
