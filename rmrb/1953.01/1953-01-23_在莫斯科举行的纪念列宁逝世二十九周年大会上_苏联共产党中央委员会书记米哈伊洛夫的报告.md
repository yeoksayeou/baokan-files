Comrades!

Today marks the twenty-ninth anniversary of the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder and leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the father of the Soviet socialist state, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world, and a genius thinker and master of revolutionary science.

For twenty-nine years, the Communist Party has confidently led the Soviet people forward along the path pointed out by Lenin. Leninism, like the brilliant sunshine, illuminates our path of struggle and victory. Under the banner of Lenin, and under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people are victoriously building the magnificent edifice of communism.

The achievements of the Soviet state and the great growth of the strength of the camp of peace and democracy embody the invincible power and greatness of Leninism, which has a decisive influence on the entire course of world history. Lenin's cause is immortal. Time cannot erase the brilliance of Lenin's genius. The image of the great Lenin lives in the hearts of the working people of the world, inspiring them to fight for a new life, for democracy and socialism.

(I)

Lenin was the genius of the greatest socialist revolution. Under his leadership, the workers and peasants of our country seized power. A new era in human history, an era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism, began.

Lenin said: "The elimination of capitalism and its remnants, and the implementation of the principles of the communist order, are the content of the new era that has already begun in world history."

From the very beginning, the Soviet state began to recognize the historical task of building socialism. After the difficult years of the civil war and armed intervention, the working people of our country restored industry, transportation, and agriculture; urban and rural ties were organized, and the worker-peasant alliance was consolidated and expanded.

Lenin had unlimited confidence in the creativity of the people. The great leader foresaw the path of development of the Soviet state for decades and predicted that Russia would become a socialist country.

In defining the path for the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, Lenin pointed out that heavy industry is the material foundation of socialism. In the communist transformation of the country, he especially emphasized the importance of electrification. Lenin said that only when the whole country is covered with a network of power stations can we build a communist society.

The Communist Party had to build socialism in a country where small-scale peasant economy predominated. In his writings, Lenin profoundly studied the question of how to transform agriculture according to the new policy, and how to involve the working peasants in the work of socialist construction.

The enemies of the Party and the Soviet people—the Trotsky-Bukharin degenerates, capitulationists, and traitors—attempted to prevent the Party from completing its historical tasks; they wanted to lead the Party astray from the correct path. All these attempts were resolutely and ruthlessly rebuffed by Lenin and Stalin, who tempered the Party, cultivated it, and educated it in a spirit of uncompromising attitude toward all enemies of the Soviet motherland and unlimited loyalty to the cause of the working people.

Lenin left the Party and the people an invaluable treasure—the great, universally applicable science of building a new world. Before the coffin of V.I. Lenin, his loyal comrade-in-arms and student, Comrade Stalin, solemnly swore to realize Lenin's legacy and to unswervingly follow Lenin's path.

Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party realized this oath. The long-term backwardness of Tsarist Russia is gone forever. The unemployment, ignorance, despairing poverty, and suffering of the working people no longer exist. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has become a great socialist country with highly developed first-class industry, large-scale collective agriculture, and advanced economy and culture. The Soviet land has become the pride and hope of all progressive humanity struggling for international peace and friendship, and an ever-burning beacon of socialism.

The recently convened 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union summarized the great victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and formulated a plan for the further construction of communism in the Soviet Union. The Congress passed the directives for the development of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan (the Fifth Five-Year Plan). The completion of this plan will be an important stage in the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

The Soviet people enthusiastically accepted the directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and the main tasks it stipulated, and unanimously expressed their support. Every day, news of the heroic labor of the Soviet people comes from all over our motherland. The time-tested leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the will of the Soviet people, and the surging socialist competition are the best guarantee that the tasks of the Five-Year Plan can not only be completed but also be overfulfilled.

In his writings, Lenin brilliantly defined the main line of development of Soviet society towards communism, pointing out that there are two stages in the development of communist society. Lenin taught that there is no Great Wall between socialism and communism, and that they are not different socio-political structures. Lenin said: "Socialism is a society that arises directly from capitalism. Socialism is the primary form of the new society. And communism is a higher form of society. It can only develop when socialism is fully consolidated."

Comrade Stalin accepted Lenin's legacy, developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism, summarized the experience of building socialism in the Soviet Union, discovered the objective laws governing the transition from socialism to communism, and armed the Party and the Soviet people with a clear program for the struggle to achieve communism. Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" solved the most complex theoretical and practical problems facing the Party under new historical conditions. This work opened up and illuminated the prospects for communist construction.

The tasks that the Soviet people must accomplish during the transition from socialism to communism are complex and multifaceted. But there is no doubt that these tasks will be victoriously completed.

Inspired by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the vigorous Soviet people are full of confidence in their brighter tomorrow and are advancing along the Leninist path. In these years after the loss of Lenin, at various difficult turning points, Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the Party, led the Party and led the masses. (Prolonged applause) The combat call issued by our Party—under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, march towards the victory of communism—has penetrated the hearts of the Soviet people. This call brilliantly expresses an irrefutable truth: Lenin's cause is being victorious, and Comrade Stalin is steadfastly leading the working people towards communism. (Applause)

(II)

The founders of scientific communism, Marx and Engels, discovered the economic laws of capitalism and proved the historical inevitability of the demise of capitalist society and its replacement by a new social system.

In summarizing the development of a subsequent historical period, Lenin discovered the essence, main characteristics, and development laws of the highest stage of capitalism—imperialism. Comrade Stalin said: "Lenin's merit, and his new contribution, lies in the fact that, based on the basic principles expounded in 'Capital,' he made a well-founded Marxist analysis of imperialism as the final stage of capitalism, and revealed its sores and the conditions for its inevitable demise."

Comrade Stalin creatively developed Leninism, made a profound analysis of the general crisis of the entire capitalist system, and revealed the essence of the economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism.

Comrade Stalin discovered the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism. The different nature of these two laws determines the two different lines of economic development of the socialist camp and the capitalist camp.

One line of development is the continuous rise of the peaceful economy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The other line of development is the capitalist economy, which is stagnating and is trapped in the increasingly deeper quagmire of the general crisis of capitalism and the recurrent economic crises; it is a line of economic militarization, competition between many countries, and the enslavement of some countries by others.

The head of the capitalist camp, U.S. imperialism, is the most reactionary and heinous force, and the gendarme and murderer who suffocates the freedom of the people. Lenin wrote: "The American billionaires, these modern slave owners, have opened a particularly tragic page in the bloody history of bloody imperialism."

The huge expenses for war preparations, the frenzied arms race, the destruction of the last remnants of bourgeois democracy, the ruthless plunder of the working people, and the daily increase in the wealth of a handful of violent billionaires—this is the situation in modern America, this is the American way of life.

U.S. imperialism is blinded by its extreme hatred for all that is progressive and advanced. The leaders of U.S. imperialism waste their efforts shouting in profit-seeking newspapers that they love peace. Facts prove the opposite.

If U.S. imperialists truly love peace and oppose new wars, then why do they obstruct and undermine the proposals for disarmament and the conclusion of a peace pact between the five great powers?

If U.S. imperialists oppose war, then how do we explain their actions in Korea, such as massacring defenseless women and children, destroying peaceful towns and villages, and using bacteriological weapons?

Never in the world has there been such shameless, all-encompassing lies as those spread by U.S. imperialists today. If the mask is removed, the true face of U.S. imperialism is the plunder of the people, war, murder, and espionage.

U.S. imperialism is brazenly rampaging in capitalist countries, destroying their economies, plundering not only workers and peasants but also the middle and petty bourgeoisie, and despising the traditional customs of the people of various countries.

This policy of U.S. imperialism has aroused the hatred of the freedom-loving people of all countries. The aggressive policy of the United States has greatly promoted the political contradictions between the capitalist countries and strengthened the struggle of the people of various countries, trapped in the talons of U.S. imperialism, for independence and freedom.

A powerful and organized movement for peace has unfolded in various countries. The ranks of peace fighters include billions of people of different nationalities, occupations, political views, and religious beliefs. The Vienna Peace Congress once again vividly proved that this democratic movement of the people of various countries is a force capable of thwarting the bloody plans of the instigators of a new war.

The American aggressors are doing everything possible to deceive the people of various countries, making them feel that there is only one road that can be taken, namely, the road of war, and that this war must be directed against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

On the other hand, the Soviet people adhere to Lenin's instructions on the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the socialist system and the capitalist system and the possibility of peaceful competition between the two systems. J.V. Stalin said: "Lenin first expressed the idea of cooperation between the two systems. Lenin is our teacher, and we, the Soviet people, are Lenin's students. We have never violated Lenin's instructions and will never violate them."

The Communist Party and the Soviet state are firmly and consistently implementing a policy of peace. Comrade Stalin said: "...the interests of our Party and the interests of the peace-loving people of various countries not only do not contradict each other, but are integrated together. As for the Soviet Union, its interests can never be separated from the cause of world peace."

Comrade Stalin's clear and thorough answer to the reporter of the "New York Times" once again proved that the Soviet Union firmly safeguards the cause of peace, resolutely opposes the Korean War, and is prepared to cooperate with various capitalist countries, including the United States, in the cause of maintaining world peace and maintaining international friendship. Comrade Stalin's answer has disrupted the cards in the hands of the warmongers and once again exposed the aggressors in front of the whole world.

While the Soviet state firmly and consistently fulfills its peace policy, it maintains a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of the warmongers. The Party and the Soviet government follow the instructions of Lenin and Stalin that the socialist state must be constantly strengthened and its power increased. Lenin taught us this, and Comrade Stalin constantly teaches us this.

The warmongers use blackmail and intimidation to promote their diplomacy. Lenin warned not to be influenced by this despicable trick used against people with nervous breakdowns.

Lenin said in 1922: "...when we see in the newspapers various news aimed at frightening some of us about the various tests they are going to subject us to, we can calmly laugh it off. We have seen enough threats that are much more serious than the merchants closing their doors and sending away customers after quoting the lowest price. We have seen threats in the form of the artillery of the allied countries that almost controlled the whole world. However, we were not intimidated by these threats."

The imperialist robbers who attempt to invade the Soviet Union should remember the lessons of history. The makers of a new war should realize that a third world war—if they launch it—will inevitably lead to the collapse of the entire world capitalist system. (Prolonged applause)

Lenin's great ideas inspire the entire revolutionary international working class and the communist movement. Leninism is the sacred fighting banner of millions of people.

The victory of socialism and the construction of communism in the Soviet Union have a decisive influence on the course of world history. The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties and the working people of the people's democratic countries are learning from the experience of the Party of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of the Soviet people. Leninism inspires the people of capitalist and colonial countries to fight against their oppressors and for freedom and independence.

The people of the whole world see the new life, the happy and joyful life, in the country illuminated by the brilliance of the star of socialism. Free labor for oneself and for the motherland, true people's democracy, unlimited opportunities for the development of body and mind, the most advanced and truly humane communist ideas dominating—this is the socialist way of life that the working people of the whole world yearn for.

The genius Lenin and Stalin have pointed out to all mankind the road to a new life. The people of all countries in the world will sooner or later take this road. There is no other road, nor can there be. Lenin taught us this, and history teaches us this.

In the dawn of the Russian revolutionary movement, Lenin wrote: "All of us, standing closely together, hand in hand, are advancing along a steep and difficult road. We are surrounded by enemies, and we must advance under their gunfire almost every moment."

The communist movement, to which Lenin dedicated his whole life, has become a huge and invincible force. Millions of fighters are closely united under the banner of Lenin and Stalin. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has about seven million members and alternate members, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world have more than twenty-four million members. This is a huge force.

Stalin said: "Now, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, new 'shock brigades' in the form of people's democratic countries have emerged—now it is easier for our Party to fight, and this work is done more vigorously."

The growth of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries is a vivid embodiment of Leninism and a proof of the great victory of Lenin's ideas. Communism is winning—communism will win a complete and irreversible victory.

Leninism is spreading to the farthest corners of the world. There is no force in the world, nor can there be any force, that can stop its victorious advance.

(III)

The Communist Party founded by Lenin and Stalin is the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet people. There has never been a party in the world that has fought so consistently and so fearlessly for the interests of the working people as the Communist Party. The Party of Lenin-Stalin has won boundless love and respect for its selfless struggle for the cause of the people.

Lenin and Stalin tempered the Party in the uncompromising struggle against all enemies of the working people, and educated the Party in the spirit of unwavering confidence in the strength of the people, in the spirit of firmly and steadily advancing toward the predetermined goal and destroying all obstacles in the way. The people entrusted their destiny, their own future, to the Party of Lenin-Stalin, and the Party did not disappoint them. Under the banner of Lenin, and under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Communist Party is bravely and confidently leading the Soviet people through all difficulties and trials, through all storms and dangers, from one victory to another.

Lenin constantly cared about the unity of the Party, the purity of the Party's ranks, and the nobility of the title of Party member. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Party resolutely applied this Leninist principle. The Communist Party is a fighting alliance composed of people of like minds—Communists—and this alliance is strong because of their unity, their organization, and their unlimited loyalty to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin, and to their leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin. (Prolonged applause)

The Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, adopted at the 19th Party Congress, made the title of Party member even more noble. The requirements for Communist Party members not only had a huge and positive influence on Communist Party members, but also the working masses followed the Party, learned from the Party, and saw in its principles the embodiment of the most progressive and correct ideas.

Lenin constantly cultivated the Party in the spirit of maintaining close and inseparable ties with the broad masses of working people. Comrade Stalin especially emphasized this Leninist requirement, pointing out that contact with the masses and the ability to listen to the voices of the masses are the key to the Party's strong and invincible leadership.

The Soviet people are deeply convinced from years of experience that the Party of Lenin-Stalin has no other interests than the interests of the people, and that the Communist Party regards selfless service to the motherland and to the people as its highest goal. This is the reason why the people of our entire country accept the policies of the Communist Party and regard them as their own cause. The struggle to realize Lenin's ideals and for the victory of Leninism has long been not only the cause of the Party, not only the cause of the Communist Party members, but also the cause of the broad masses of non-Party people, the cause of the entire Soviet people.

The method of criticism and self-criticism is one of the inherent characteristics of the Communist Party as a truly revolutionary party, a new type of party. Criticism and self-criticism is a special, socialist method of exposing and overcoming difficulties and contradictions. Lenin pointed out that only a truly revolutionary, strong and firm, consolidated and united party can boldly criticize itself, expose its mistakes, weaknesses, and shortcomings, and overcome them.

Comrade Stalin constantly taught us that self-criticism is as necessary to us as air and water, and that the slogan of self-criticism is the central link in the communist method of training cadres. In accordance with the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, the Party Constitution stipulates that one of the major tasks of Party members is to develop self-criticism and criticism from below, to expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate these shortcomings, and to oppose complacency and being overwhelmed by achievements in work. The Party believes that suppressing criticism is a serious crime. Anyone who suppresses criticism and replaces it with arrogance and flattery is not worthy of staying in the Party.

The achievements made by the Soviet people in building a new society are indeed huge and of epoch-making significance. Among many politically immature comrades, these achievements have caused them to be complacent and careless, and have relaxed their political vigilance.

In the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union won an unprecedented victory. In a short period of time, our country healed the serious wounds, eradicated the consequences of the war, and moved forward greatly. However, we cannot therefore think that all the problems of class struggle have been removed from the agenda, nor can we think that there is no longer a danger of sabotage and espionage by capitalist countries in our country. The greater the achievements of communist construction, the more unscrupulous, malicious, and barbaric the means and methods of struggle used by our enemies. The smoother our development, the more intense the struggle of the enemies of the people who are destined to be destroyed.

Lenin, in summing up the initial results of the implementation of the policies of the Soviet government, said that the first rule and the first lesson that all workers and peasants, all working people, must learn is to be vigilant at all times and to always remember that we are surrounded by people, classes, and governments who openly express their extreme hatred for us.

Comrade Stalin repeatedly emphasized that the deeply ingrained anti-Party meaning of the so-called "extinguishing" of class struggle.

Comrade Stalin said, "Some comrades explain the theory of eliminating classes, establishing a classless society, and the withering away of the state in such a way as to find excuses for laziness and complacency, and to find excuses for such a counter-revolutionary theory, that the class struggle is extinguishing and that state power can be weakened. Needless to say, such people have nothing in common with our Party. They are either degenerates or fence-sitters, and therefore must be expelled from the Party. The elimination of classes is not an abandonment of the class struggle, but a strengthening of the class struggle in order to achieve it."

Socialism has won in our country. In the Soviet Union, the exploiting classes have long been crushed and eliminated. However, in our country there are still remnants of bourgeois ideology, and remnants of private system mentality and morality. In the Soviet Union there are still people with bourgeois views and bourgeois morality—living people, the hidden enemies of our people. These hidden enemies, supported by the imperialist world, have harmed us before and will continue to harm us in the future. The case of the doctor saboteurs—the shameful spies and murderers—who sold themselves to the slave owners and cannibals of the United States and Britain and hid behind the mask of doctors, convincingly proves this.

All Soviet people must have a high degree of political vigilance and oppose any manifestation of complacency and foolish carelessness. Only by maintaining such vigilance can we prevent all destructive attempts by the enemy and help expose enemy agents, no matter how cleverly they are disguised. Vigilance must become our weapon that we use regularly.

In addition to enemy agents, we have another enemy—the credulity and carelessness of some of us. There are already many credulous and careless people among us. It is the credulity and carelessness of some of us that have created opportunities for spies and saboteurs to operate. As long as our credulity and carelessness are not corrected, sabotage will inevitably occur. Therefore, in order to eliminate sabotage, we must eliminate credulity and carelessness in our ranks.

The Soviet people, following the instructions of the immortal Lenin, must never forget for a moment: we must do everything possible to raise their vigilance; closely watch all the conspiracies of the warmongers, and tirelessly strengthen the armed forces and security organs of the Soviet state.

During the period of transition from socialism to communism in Soviet society, the communist education of the people has become a particularly important matter. Leninism is the ideological foundation for educating the Soviet people. The Communist Party is strong because it is guided by the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in all its activities. Comrade Stalin, in emphasizing the great significance of Marxism-Leninism, repeatedly pointed out: In all the treasures of the Party, the most important and most valuable treasure is its ideological treasure.

The Party of Lenin and Stalin cultivates in the hearts of the Soviet people a communist attitude toward labor and socialist property, it cultivates in their hearts a lofty sense of responsibility to society, and cultivates the ideas of Soviet patriotism and the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities. The Party cultivates and educates with loving care the best qualities of the Soviet people, the lofty qualities of the builders of communist society.

Socialist ideology occupies a dominant position in our country. However, this by no means allows for any, even the slightest, slackening of the Party's ideological and educational work. Any underestimation of socialist ideology will lead to the strengthening of bourgeois ideology. At the 19th Party Congress, the serious shortcomings in ideological work were sharply criticized. The task is to ensure that the educational work of all Party organizations advances under the banner of Leninism.

The Party carries out all its work through its own cadres. The success or failure of the work depends on the selection, education, and training of cadres. Lenin and Stalin always attached great importance to the selection of cadres and the inspection of the implementation of resolutions, considering it a decisive and necessary condition for organizational work. Comrade Stalin taught us: Cadres decide everything.

We must unswervingly apply the principles of Lenin and Stalin on the selection and training of cadres. With reference to the tasks set by the 19th Party Congress, these issues must occupy a top priority in the activities of Party organizations.

Comrades, there is no doubt that the Party of Lenin and Stalin will gloriously complete its historical task. Inspired by Comrade Stalin, its great leader and teacher, the Communist Party is steadfastly and confidently leading the Soviet people toward the established goal.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has won and is winning all kinds of great victories because it faithfully adheres to Leninism in everything and at all times, because it devoutly observes and implements Lenin's instructions and plans.

The doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, which our Party uses as a guide, is constantly developing and enriching itself with new experience. Comrade Stalin, the wise leader and teacher of the Party, the Soviet people, and all progressive humanity, has further developed Leninism in his brilliant works, making it applicable to the new era, to the era of building a communist society.

(Prolonged applause)

Under the bright red fighting banner of Lenin and Stalin, our Party has fought for and won the victory and consolidation of the new social system on Soviet soil.

Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, the Communist Party and the Soviet people will build communism. (Applause)

Long live Leninism! (Applause)

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the inspirer and organizer of all our victories! (Applause)

Long live Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, our wise leader and teacher! (Stormy applause)

Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, advance towards the victory of communism! (Stormy and prolonged applause expressing love for Comrade Stalin, the leader of all progressive humanity. All rise.)

    在莫斯科举行的纪念列宁逝世二十九周年大会上
    苏联共产党中央委员会书记米哈伊洛夫的报告同志们！
    今天是苏联共产党的缔造者和领袖、苏维埃社会主义国家的父亲、全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师、天才思想家和革命科学巨匠——乌拉吉米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世的二十九周年。
    二十九年以来，共产党一直满怀信心地领导着苏联人民沿着列宁指出的道路前进。列宁主义思想像灿烂的阳光一样，为我们照亮了斗争和胜利的道路。在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林同志的领导下，苏联人民正胜利地建设着宏伟的共产主义大厦。
    苏维埃国家的成就、和平民主阵营力量的大大增长体现了对整个世界历史进程起决定性影响的列宁主义所具有的不可战胜的力量和伟大性。列宁主义事业是不朽的。时间磨灭不了列宁的天才的光辉。伟大的列宁的形像活在全世界劳动人民的心中，它鼓舞他们为新的生活、为民主和社会主义进行斗争。
    （一）
    列宁是最伟大的社会主义革命的天才。在他的领导下，我国的工人和农民取得了政权。人类历史上的新纪元、资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的纪元开始了。
    列宁说：“资本主义及其残余的消灭、共产主义秩序的原则的实施，就是世界历史上已经开始了的新纪元的内容。”
    苏维埃国家从立国之日起就开始认识到建设社会主义的历史任务。经过了内战和武装干涉的艰苦年代后，我国的劳动人民恢复了工业、运输和农业；城乡联系组织起来了，工农联盟得到了巩固和扩大。
    列宁对人民的创造力有无限的信心。这位伟大的领袖看到了苏维埃国家几十年的发展道路并预言俄国将成为一个社会主义国家。
    列宁在为苏联的社会主义建设规定道路时，指出重工业是社会主义的物质基础。在国家的共产主义改造工作中，他特别强调电气化的重要性。列宁说，只有在全国密布了电力站分布网时，我们才能建设成共产主义社会。
    共产党曾经必须在小农经济占优势的国家中建立社会主义。列宁在他的著作中，深刻地从各种角度研究了根据新方针改造农业的方法的问题以及使国内劳动农民参加社会主义建设工作的问题。
    党和苏联人民的敌人——托洛茨基—布哈林蜕化分子、投降主义者和叛徒——曾企图阻止党完成它的历史任务，他们想使党脱离正确的道路。所有这些企图都受到列宁和斯大林的坚决无情的反击，列宁和斯大林锻炼了党、培养了党、以对苏维埃祖国的一切敌人不妥协和对劳动人民的事业无限忠诚的精神教育了党。
    列宁为党和人民留下了无价之宝——伟大的、放之四海而皆准的建设新世界的科学。在乌·伊·列宁的灵柩前，他的忠实的战友和学生斯大林同志曾庄严地宣誓要实现列宁的遗训，要坚持不渝地走列宁的道路。
    斯大林同志、共产党实现了这个誓言。沙皇俄国的长期的落后状态一去不复返了。劳动人民的失业、愚昧无知、绝望的贫困和苦难永远不存在了。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟成了一个拥有高度发展的头等工业、大规模的集体农业、先进的经济和文化的伟大的社会主义国家。苏维埃国土成了所有为争取国际和平和友好而斗争的进步人类的骄傲和希望，成了永不熄灭的社会主义灯塔。
    最近召开的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，总结了苏联人民在列宁和斯大林党的领导下所获得的伟大胜利，并拟订了苏联进一步建设共产主义的计划。大会通过了苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示。这个计划的完成将是从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的过程中一个重要的阶段。
    苏联人民热烈地接受了第五个五年计划的指示以及它规定的主要任务，并一致表示拥护。从我们祖国各地每天都传来关于苏联人民的英雄劳动的消息。列宁和斯大林党的久经考验的领导，苏联人民的意志、热火朝天的社会主义竞赛是五年计划的任务不但能完成而且能超额完成的最好的保证。
    列宁在他的著作中天才地规定了苏维埃社会向共产主义发展的主要路线，他指出，共产主义社会的发展有两个阶段。列宁教导说：社会主义和共产主义之间并没有一道长城，它们并不是不同的社会—政治结构。列宁说：“社会主义是直接从资本主义产生出来的社会。社会主义是新社会的初级形态。而共产主义则是更高级的社会形式。它只有在社会主义完全巩固时才能发展。”
    斯大林同志接受了列宁的遗训，发展了和丰富了马克思列宁主义，他总结了在苏联建设社会主义的经验，发现了关于由社会主义过渡到共产主义的客观法则，并以争取实现共产主义的斗争的明确纲领武装了党和苏联人民。斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”解决了党在新的历史条件下所面临的最复杂的理论和实践问题。这部著作开拓了并照亮了共产主义建设的远景。
    苏联人民在从社会主义过渡到共产主义期间必须完成的任务是复杂的、是多方面的。但是无疑的，这些任务一定会胜利地完成。
    在列宁和斯大林党的鼓舞下，力量充沛的苏联人民充满着对他们更灿烂的明天的信心，沿着列宁主义的道路前进。在失去了列宁后的这些年中，在各种困难的转折点，有党的领袖和导师斯大林同志领导着党、领导着群众。（经久不息的掌声）我们党所发出的战斗号召——在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下走向共产主义的胜利——已深入苏联人民的心灵，这个号召出色地说出了一个无容置辩的真理，就是：列宁的事业正在获得胜利，斯大林同志正在坚定不移地领导着劳动人民走向共产主义。
    （掌声）
        （二）
    科学共产主义的创立者马克思和恩格斯发现了资本主义的经济法则，并证明了资本主义社会消灭及其为一种新的社会制度所代替的历史必然性。
    在概括随后一个历史时期的发展情况时，列宁发现了资本主义的最高阶段——帝国主义的本质、主要特点和发展规律。斯大林同志说：“列宁的功劳也就是他的新贡献便是：他根据‘资本论’内阐明的基本原则，对于作为资本主义最后阶段的帝国主义，作了有根据的马克思主义的分析并揭露了它的脓疮和不可避免的灭亡的条件。”
    斯大林同志创造性地发展了列宁主义，对于整个资本主义体系的总危机作了深刻的分析，揭示了现代资本主义和社会主义经济法则的实质。
    斯大林同志发现了现代资本主义的基本经济法则和社会主义的基本经济法则。这两个法则的不同性质决定了社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营经济发展的两条不同路线。
    一条发展路线是苏联和各人民民主国家和平经济的不断上升。另一条发展路线是生产力停滞不前的资本主义经济的发展路线，这种经济正陷于愈来愈深的资本主义总危机和一再发生的经济危机的困境中；这是经济军事化、许多国家互相竞争、某些国家奴役另外一些国家的路线。
    资本主义阵营的头子美帝国主义是最反动和穷凶极恶的势力，是扼杀人民自由的宪兵和凶手。列宁写道：“美国的亿万富翁、这些现代的奴隶主揭开了血腥帝国主义的血腥历史上特别悲惨的一页。”
    数目庞大的备战费用，疯狂的扩张军备运动，资产阶级民主最后残余的摧毁，对劳动人民的残酷抢掠，一小撮暴戾亿万富翁的财富的一天天加多——这就是现代美国的情况，这就是美国的生活方式。
    美帝国主义由于极端仇视一切进步和先进的事物而弄昏了头脑。美帝国主义的首脑们在唯利是图的报纸上白费力气地空喊他们热爱和平。事实证明恰恰相反。
    如果美帝国主义者真正爱好和平并反对新战争的话，那末他们为什么阻挠和破坏裁减军备和缔结五大国和平公约的建议呢？
    如果美帝国主义者反对战争，那末我们怎样解释他们在朝鲜的举动，如屠杀手无寸铁的妇女儿童、摧毁和平城镇村庄以及使用细菌武器呢？
    世界上从来没有过像美帝国主义者现在所散播的这样无耻的漫天大谎。如果揭去了假面具，美帝国主义的真面目就是掠夺人民、战争、谋杀和从事间谍活动。
    美帝国主义正厚颜无耻地在资本主义国家中横行霸道，破坏他们的经济，不仅掠夺工人和农民并且还掠夺中、小资产阶级，蔑视各国人民的传统习惯。
    美帝国主义的这种政策激起了爱好自由的各国人民的痛恨。美国的侵略政策大大地促进了各资本主义国家之间的政治矛盾，并且加强了落入美帝国主义鹰爪中的各国人民的争取独立和自由的斗争。
    各国已展开了一个强大的、有组织的和平运动。和平战士的队伍包括了国籍、职业、政见和宗教信仰各不相同的亿万人民。维也纳和平大会又一次生动地证明了各国人民的这种民主运动，是一支能够挫败新战争煽动者的血腥计划的力量。
    美国侵略者正在尽一切力量欺骗各国人民，使他们觉得只有一条可以行得通的道路，就是战争的道路，而且这一种战争必须是针对苏联和各人民民主国家的。
    另一方面，苏联人民则恪守列宁关于社会主义制度和资本主义制度有可能和平相处以及这两种制度有可能进行和平竞赛的训示。约·维·斯大林说：“列宁首先表示了两个制度合作的思想。列宁是我们的导师，我们苏联人民是列宁的学生。我们从没有违背过列宁的训示并且永远不会违背。”
    共产党和苏维埃国家是坚定地、一贯地执行和平政策的。斯大林同志说：“……我们党的利益和爱好和平的各国人民的利益不但没有矛盾，而且是融合在一起的。至于苏联，它的利益是决不能跟世界和平的事业分开的。”
    斯大林同志对“纽约时报”记者的清楚而透彻的答复，又一次证明苏联坚定地维护和平事业，坚决反对朝鲜战争，并准备在保持世界和平的事业中、在保持国际友好的事业中与各资本主义国家合作，包括美国在内。斯大林同志的答复已打乱了战争贩子手中的牌，并再一次使侵略者在全世界面前原形毕露。
    苏维埃国家一方面坚定地、一贯地履行它的和平政策，同时对战争贩子的阴谋保持高度的警惕。党和苏维埃政府遵循列宁和斯大林关于必须不断地加强社会主义国家、增加它的力量的训示。列宁这样教导我们，斯大林同志也不断地这样教导我们。
    战争贩子用讹诈和恫吓的手段来推行他们的外交政策。列宁曾警告说，不要受这种针对着神经衰弱的人所使用的卑鄙奸计的影响。
    列宁在一九二二年说：“……当我们在报上看到旨在吓唬我们中间某些人的关于他们要使我们受到某种考验的各种消息时，我们可以冷静地置之一笑。我们已经看够了各种比商人们在说出了最低价格后就要关门送客严重得多的威胁。我们曾经看见过以几乎控制了全世界的结成联盟的国家的大炮这种形式出现的威胁。然而我们并没有为这些威胁所吓倒。”
    企图进犯苏联的帝国主义强盗们应当记取历史的教训。新战争的制造者应当认识，第三次世界大战——如果他们发动的话——必然导致整个世界资本主义制度的崩溃。（经久不息的掌声）
    列宁的伟大思想鼓舞着整个革命的国际工人阶级和共产主义运动。列宁主义是千百万人民神圣战斗旗帜。
    苏联的社会主义的胜利和共产主义的建设对世界历史的进程有着决定性的影响。各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党和劳动人民，正在学习列宁和斯大林的党的经验，学习苏联人民的经验。列宁主义的思想鼓舞着资本主义国家和殖民地国家的人民为反对他们的压迫者、争取自由和独立而斗争。
    全世界人民看到社会主义之星的光辉所照耀着的国家里的新生活，幸福愉快的生活。人民为自己、为祖国而进行自由劳动，真正的人民民主，无限的发展身心的机会，最先进的真正合乎人道的共产主义思想占支配地位——这就是全世界劳动人民所向往的社会主义生活方式。
    天才的列宁和斯大林已给全人类指出走向新生活的道路。全世界一切国家的人民迟早要走这条道路。别的道路是没有的，也不可能有。列宁这样教导我们，历史也这样教导我们。
    在俄国革命运动的黎明时期，列宁写道：“我们大家紧紧靠在一起，紧紧地手拉着手，正在沿着一条险峻艰难的道路向前进。我们被敌人团团包围，我们几乎时时刻刻都必须冒着他们的弹雨向前进。”
    列宁为之献出整个生命的共产主义运动，已经变成一支巨大的不可战胜的力量。千百万战士紧紧地团结在列宁和斯大林的旗帜之下。苏联共产党已拥有七百万左右的党员和候补党员，全世界共产党和工人党拥有二千四百多万党员。这是一支巨大的力量。
    斯大林说：“现在，从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利，已经出现了人民民主国家形式的新‘突击队’——现在我们的党进行斗争是比较容易了，这种工作也做得更是蓬蓬勃勃了。”
    各国共产党和工人党的成长是列宁主义的生动体现，是列宁思想的伟大胜利的一个证明。共产主义正在取得胜利——共产主义一定会取得完全的不可改变的胜利。
    列宁主义的思想正在向世界上的最遥远的角落传播。世界上没有任何力量、也不可能有任何力量能够阻止它胜利前进。
        （三）
    列宁和斯大林创立的共产党是苏联人民一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。世界上从来不曾有一个像共产党这样始终不懈地、这样大无畏地为劳动人民的利益进行斗争的党。列宁—斯大林的党由于它为人民事业的忘我斗争而获得了无限的爱戴和尊敬。
    列宁和斯大林在反对劳动人民的一切敌人的不屈不挠的斗争过程中锻炼党，以对人民力量的不可动摇的信心的精神，以坚定地、稳步地向预定目标前进、摧毁道路上的一切障碍的精神来教育党。人民将他们的命运、把他们自己的前途付托给列宁—斯大林的党，党并没有使他们失望。在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林同志的领导下，共产党正勇敢地、满怀信心地领导着苏联人民一个胜利接连一个胜利地通过一切困难和考验、通过一切风暴和危险。
    列宁经常地关怀党的团结、党的队伍的纯洁性和党员称号的崇高性。在斯大林同志的领导下，党坚决地应用了这个列宁主义原则。共产党是由思想一致的人们——共产主义者——组成的一个战斗联盟，由于他们的团结，他们的组织性和对伟大的列宁、斯大林的事业、对他们的领袖和导师斯大林同志的无限忠诚，这个联盟是强大的。（经久不息的掌声）
    在第十九次党代表大会上通过的苏联共产党党章使党员的称号更加崇高了。党章对于共产党员的要求不仅对于共产党员产生了巨大的、有利的影响，劳动群众跟随着党，向党学习，并从它的原则看到了最进步的、最正确的思想的体现。
    列宁不断地以和广大的劳动人民群众保持密切的、不可分的联系的精神来培育党。斯大林同志特别强调这个列宁主义的要求，他指出，与群众的联系、倾听群众声音的能力是党的领导坚强有力而不可战胜的关键。
    苏联人民从多年的经验中深信，列宁—斯大林的党除了人民的利益以外，再没有其他的利益，共产党把为祖国、为人民忘我地服务看作是它最高的目的。我国全体劳动人民之所以接受共产党的政策，把它作为他们自己的切身事业，就是这个缘故。为实现列宁的理想、为列宁主义的胜利而进行的斗争，早已不仅是党、不仅是共产党员的事业，而且也是广大的非党人民、全体苏联人民的事业了。
    批评与自我批评的方法是共产党作为一个真正革命的党、新型的党所固有的特征之一。批评和自我批评是一个揭发困难和矛盾并加以克服的特别的、社会主义的方法。列宁指出，只有一个真正革命的、强大和坚定的、巩固和团结的党才能大胆地批评自己，揭发它的错误、弱点和缺点，并加以克服。
    斯大林同志经常教导我们，自我批评对于我们像空气、像水一样必要，自我批评的口号是训练干部的共产主义方法的中心环节。本着列宁和斯大林的训示，党章规定，党员的重大任务之一是展开自我批评和自下而上的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力消灭这些缺点，反对矜夸自满和被工作中的成绩冲昏头脑。党认为压制批评是严重的罪恶。凡是压制批评而代之以自高自大和喜欢奉承的人，就不配留在党内。
    苏联人民在建设新社会方面获得的成就确实是巨大的，具有划时代意义的。在许多政治不够成熟的同志中间，这些成就引起他们自满和漫不经心的情绪，使他们的政治警惕性松懈。
    在伟大的卫国战争中，苏联获得了史无前例的胜利。在短期内我国就治好了严重的创伤，根除了战争所引起的后果，大大地向前迈进了。然而却不能因此就认为，一切阶级斗争的问题已经从日程上取消了，也不能认为现在我国不再有资本主义国家进行破坏和间谍活动的危险了。共产主义建设的成就越大，我们的敌人使用的斗争手段和方法也就越加不讲信义，越加恶毒和野蛮。我们的发展越顺利，注定要毁灭的人民公敌的挣扎也就越加激烈。
    列宁在总结实行苏维埃政府政策的初期结果时说，所有的工人和农民、所有的劳动人民必须学习的第一条戒律，第一个教训就是随时警惕，常常记住我们周围是各种公开表示对我们极端仇视的人、阶级和政府。
    斯大林同志反复地强调指出所谓阶级斗争“熄灭”这句话的根深蒂固的反党涵义。
    斯大林同志说，“有些同志把消灭阶级，建立没有阶级的社会以及国家消亡的理论作如此的解释，以便为懒惰和自满找借口，为这样的一种反革命理论、即阶级斗争正在熄灭而国家权力可以削弱找借口。不用说，这种人与我们党是毫无共同之处的。他们不是蜕化分子便是骑墙派，因而必须驱逐出党。阶级的消灭并不是放弃阶级斗争而是要加强阶级斗争才能获得的。”
    社会主义在我国获得了胜利。在苏联剥削阶级早就被粉碎了、被消灭了。然而，在我们国内依然存在着资产阶级思想的残余，存在着私有制度心理和道德的残余。在苏联依然存在着有资产阶级观点和资产阶级道德的人——活的人，我们人民的隐秘敌人。这些受帝国主义世界支持的隐秘敌人以前损害过我们，将来还要继续损害我们。这次把自己出卖给美国和英国的奴隶主和吃人野兽而隐藏在医生假面具后面的医生破坏者——可耻的间谍和杀人犯集团的案件，就令人信服地证明了这一点。
    所有苏维埃人民必须有高度的政治警惕性，反对任何自满和愚蠢的漫不经心的表现。只有保持这样的警惕性才能防止敌人的一切破坏的企图并帮助揭露敌人特务分子，不管他们伪装得怎样巧妙。警惕性必须成为我们经常使用的武器。
    除了敌人特务以外，我们还有一个敌人——我们中间一部分人的轻信和疏忽。我们中间已出现不少轻信和疏忽的人。正是我们中间一部分人的轻信和疏忽给间谍和破坏分子造成了活动的机会。只要我们的轻信和疏忽不纠正，破坏事件就不免要发生。因此，为消灭破坏事件，我们必须消灭我们队伍中的轻信和疏忽。
    苏联人民遵照着不朽的列宁的指示，一时一刻也不能忘记：必须极力提高他们的警惕；严密注视战争贩子的一切阴谋，不倦地加强苏维埃国家的武装部队和保安机关。
    在苏维埃社会从社会主义过渡到共产主义期间，人民的共产主义教育已成为特别重要的事情。列宁主义是教育苏维埃人民的思想基础。共产党之所以强大，因为它在它的一切活动中是受马克思列宁主义的学说所指导的。斯大林同志在强调马克思列宁主义的伟大意义时曾经反复指出：在党的一切宝库中，最重要和最有价值的宝库便是它的思想宝库。
    列宁和斯大林的党在苏联人民心中培养对劳动和对社会主义财产的共产主义态度，它在他们心中培养一种对社会的崇高责任感，培养苏维埃爱国主义的思想和各族人民的牢不可破的友谊。党以慈爱的关怀来培养和教育苏维埃人民最优秀的特性、共产主义社会建设者们的崇高品质。
    社会主义思想在我国占有支配地位。然而决不因此就容许对党的思想和教育工作有任何的甚至最轻微的松懈。任何小看社会主义思想的想法，都会导致资产阶级思想的加强。在第十九次党代表大会中，思想工作上的严重缺点曾经受到尖锐的批评。这个任务是保证一切党组织的教育工作在列宁主义的旗帜下前进。
    党通过自己的干部来进行自己的一切工作。工作的成败就看干部的选拔、教育和训练而定。列宁和斯大林一向非常重视干部的选拔以及决议执行情况的检查，认为那是组织工作的一个决定性的必要条件。斯大林同志教导我们说：干部决定一切。
    我们必须坚忍不拔地运用列宁斯大林关于选拔和训练干部的原则。参照第十九次党代表大会所规定的任务，这些问题在党组织的活动中必须占一个头等重要的地位。
    同志们，列宁和斯大林的党必将光荣完成自己的历史任务，这是不容置疑的。共产党在自己的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志的鼓舞下，正坚定不移地、满怀信心地引导着苏联人民走向既定的目标。
    苏联共产党已经赢得了而且正在赢得各种伟大的胜利，就因为它在一切事情上、在一切时期都忠实地坚持列宁主义，因为它虔诚地遵守并贯彻列宁的训示和计划。
    我们的党奉为指南的马克思列宁主义的学说，不断地因为新的经验而发展和丰富起来。党、苏联人民和全体进步人类英明的领袖和导师斯大林同志，在他的天才著作中进一步发展了列宁主义，使它适用于新的时代，适用于建设共产主义社会的时代。
    （经久不息的鼓掌）
    在列宁和斯大林的鲜红的战斗旗帜之下，我们的党曾为新社会制度在苏维埃国土上的胜利和巩固而奋斗，并且已经得到了这个胜利。
    共产党和苏联人民将在列宁的旗帜下，在列宁事业的伟大继承者——天才的斯大林同志的领导下建设成共产主义。（鼓掌）
    列宁主义万岁！（鼓掌）
    苏联共产党、列宁和斯大林的党、我们一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者万岁！（鼓掌）
    列宁事业的伟大继承者、我们英明的领袖和导师斯大林同志万岁！（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，向着共产主义的胜利前进！（向全体进步人类的领袖斯大林同志表示热爱的暴风雨般、经久不息的鼓掌。全体起立）
