Cadre Spare-Time Theory Schools Should Be Promoted and Established

    In the past one or two years, Party committees in many regions have piloted some cadre spare-time theory schools (also called spare-time Party schools or spare-time political schools) to conduct theoretical education for cadres in their posts. Most of the existing cadre spare-time theory schools in various regions are established for cadres participating in intermediate and primary group theory studies, that is, they are adopted as a new way of cadre theory study, except for a few that accept cadres with higher theoretical levels to participate in studies or take cultivating theory teachers and study instructors as their task. The existing cadre spare-time theory schools are run better in some regions and worse in others, and generally speaking, the experience is not yet complete due to the short time. However, adopting this method for theoretical education of cadres in their posts has shown many advantages and has shown that it is a method worthy of promotion.

    What are the advantages of cadre spare-time theory schools? Judging from the experience of Shenyang, Tangshan, and other places introduced in today's newspaper (see page 3), in the period before the establishment of cadre spare-time theory schools, the work of cadre theoretical education was more or less scattered and unorganized. Since the form of spare-time schools was adopted, that is, several units or one unit established a spare-time school, established personnel responsible for school affairs and teaching affairs, formulated certain management systems, and the local Party committee propaganda departments also uniformly formulated the education plans for each school in the city, unified the teaching progress, and unified the training and deployment of teachers, the phenomenon that no one was responsible for the work of cadre theoretical education in various units in the past has been greatly reduced. The phenomenon of unplanned and repetitive and chaotic learning content has been eliminated; the situation of relying solely on small group discussions without lectures and guidance has been greatly improved. In short, this method can greatly strengthen the leadership of theoretical education for cadres in their posts, thus advancing in-service cadre education towards regularization. Facts have proved that in places where this work is seriously led, theoretical education for cadres in their posts (mainly intermediate and primary groups) has shown a new atmosphere and has been welcomed and supported by the broad masses of cadres, the enthusiasm for learning has been greatly improved, and the effect has also been greatly improved. Many cadres have changed their past view that theoretical study of cadres in their posts cannot be done well and have established confidence in learning.

    Judging from the experience of Shenyang, Tangshan and other regions in running cadre spare-time theory schools, the following links are very important for running cadre spare-time theory schools well.

    First, leaders should attach importance to and provide concrete assistance. The main responsible comrades of the Shenyang and Tangshan municipal Party committees gave great concern and concrete support to the spare-time schools. They raised the issue of strengthening cadre theoretical education and establishing spare-time schools to the municipal Party committee meetings for serious discussion. Responsible comrades of the municipal Party committee and various units personally gave lectures, and they helped the spare-time schools solve specific difficulties such as teacher funding. These specific assistance measures enable the spare-time schools to have correct guidelines and the basic conditions for smooth development. In addition, the support of the heads of various units is also very important. In Shenyang and Tangshan, many leading comrades helped the spare-time schools in their units solve the difficulties of classrooms, transportation, and reference books, especially ensuring that cadres have fixed study time, which greatly encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for learning.

    Second, employ enough theory teachers and give teachers regular help. Except for spare-time theory schools that must be jointly run due to the small size of the unit or the difficulty of teachers, units with more cadres can generally set up schools separately, which can save cadres' time to and from school and facilitate teaching in combination with the specific circumstances of each unit and formulate practical systems. The difficulty of this approach is the large number of teachers required to be hired. Under the current circumstances, since there are very few sources of full-time teachers, and the cultivation of competent teachers cannot be completed in the short term, employing part-time teachers is still the main direction. The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee determined that all Party members and cadres with a certain theoretical level must serve as teachers, and that completing teaching tasks is regarded as completing Party work, which is completely correct. This has organized most of the forces that can serve as teachers. Since the theoretical level of cadres participating in the intermediate group is relatively high, the courses of the intermediate group can be taught by a lecture group composed of responsible cadres (since the responsible comrades are busy with work, the number of lectures should not be too many). For the considerable number of theory teachers, in addition to some comrades with high theoretical level and strong ability to prepare lessons, the propaganda department should give great help. Many places have held teacher training classes or research classes before the start of the school year, such as the Party History Theory Teacher Research Class held by the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau and the Propaganda Departments of the Provincial Party Committees of North China, the Political Common Sense Teacher Training Class held by the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, and the Political Common Sense Lectures held by the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, so that theory teachers can have sufficient preparation for the courses they teach in advance, or at least be able to "learn while teaching," which has proven to be completely necessary. This work plays a very important role in improving teaching quality. In addition, in order to improve the quality of teaching lectures and ensure the smooth progress of teaching work, the local Party committee propaganda department should set up teaching and research offices as much as possible to provide teachers with lecture outlines and various reference materials, help them answer difficult questions, and organize teachers to hold teaching and research meetings, exchange experiences, and observe each other. It must be pointed out that under the current conditions, theory teachers cannot be asked too much. They should mainly be required to correctly explain the course content. Only through the vigorous help of the Party committee propaganda department and the continuous efforts of the teachers themselves can the teaching quality be gradually improved. On this issue, an impatient attitude that requires too much is not right, but a passive attitude of waiting for teachers to grow up on their own or only using them without helping them is also not right.

    In addition, in order to strengthen the guidance of learning, many learning instructors have also been established in various places, and some have trained learning instructors. Learning instructors can reflect the situation of students and help solve some difficulties in learning. Experience in this area remains to be accumulated.

    Third, a professional institution for managing spare-time theory schools and a relatively strict learning system should be established. The city-wide leading organization of the spare-time theory school should have a certain number of full-time cadres responsible for daily work, and spare-time schools jointly established by various units or spare-time theory schools with more than 300 people established separately should also establish or designate a full-time cadre to take charge of daily work as much as possible, so as to avoid the general part-time cadres not being able to take care of them due to their own busy business. In addition, since the study of cadres in their posts is easily squeezed out by work, it is necessary to establish a relatively strict system of attendance, leave, and examinations to help them adhere to learning and strengthen the effect of learning.

    Finally, when cadre spare-time theory schools are established, concrete preparations such as establishing institutions, hiring and training teachers, compiling teaching plans and reference materials, and formulating systems should be carried out first. This work is essential. If it is hastily established or fully spread without preparation, the teaching quality will be low and the work will be chaotic. In addition, the leadership must strengthen leadership in order to gradually strengthen the regularization of spare-time schools. If it is done hastily, or just formally add an empty name of a spare-time theory school to various units without improving its actual work content, it is completely wrong.

    At present, in order to cooperate with the large-scale planned economic construction of the country, it is necessary to strengthen the theoretical education of cadres in their posts and make it increasingly regular. In addition to the fact that the theoretical study of senior cadres across the country has been greatly strengthened in the process of studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU and the works of Comrade Stalin, and must continue to be adhered to regularly, the propaganda departments of Party committees above the provincial and municipal levels across the country and the Party committees of more central cities should plan and step by step establish this cadre spare-time theory school. This will help gradually change the state of lack of organizational system in the past for cadre theoretical education and gradually improve the Marxist-Leninist level of cadres.

### 干部业余理论学校应该推广举办

    干部业余理论学校应该推广举办
    许多地区的党委，在近一二年中试办了一些干部业余理论学校（或称业余党校、业余政治学校），通过它来进行在职干部的理论教育。各地现有的干部业余理论学校除了少数吸收理论水平较高的干部参加学习或以培养理论教员和学习辅导员为自己的任务的以外，大多数都是为参加中级组和初级组理论学习的干部而设立的，也即被当做干部理论学习的一种新的方式而被采用的。现有的干部业余理论学校，有的地区办得好些、有的地区办得差些，而且，一般都由于时间短，经验还不完整。可是，采取这种方式来进行在职干部理论教育，已经显出它的许多优点，并且已经显出它是值得加以推广的一种方式。
    干部业余理论学校有些什么优点呢？从本报今天所介绍的沈阳、唐山等地的经验（见第三版）看来，在干部业余理论学校设立以前的一个时期内，干部理论教育工作或多或少都有散漫自流的现象。自从采取了业余学校的形式，即由几个单位或一个单位设立一个业余学校，设立负责校务和教务的人员，订立一定的管理制度，而且，当地党委宣传部门还统一制订全市各校教育计划、统一教学进度、统一训练与调配教员，这样一来，过去各单位中干部理论教育工作无人负责的现象就大大减少了。学习内容无计划和重复凌乱的现象消除了；只靠小组漫谈而无人讲课、无人辅导的状况大为改进了。总之，这种方式可以使在职干部理论教育的领导大大加强，从而使在职干部教育向经常化前进一步。事实已经证明，凡属认真领导这一工作的地方，在职干部理论教育（主要是中级组和初级组）就出现了新的气象，并获得广大干部的欢迎和拥护，学习的热情大大提高，效果也大有进步，许多干部改变了过去认为在职干部理论学习搞不好的观点，建立了学习的信心。
    从沈阳、唐山和其他地区举办干部业余理论学校的经验看来，为了办好干部业余理论学校，以下几个环节是十分重要的。
    第一、领导方面的重视和具体帮助。沈阳和唐山两市党委的主要负责同志对业余学校给予很大的关心和具体的支持，他们把加强干部理论教育和建立业余学校的问题提到市委会议上认真讨论，市委和各单位负责同志亲自担任讲课，他们帮助业余学校解决教员经费等具体困难。这些具体帮助，使业余学校能有正确的方针和顺利发展的基本条件。除此以外，各单位负责人的支持也很重要。沈阳、唐山的各单位中，许多领导同志帮助本单位的业余学校解决教室、交通、参考书的困难，特别是保证干部能有固定的学习时间，大大鼓舞了大家的学习热情。
    第二、聘请足够的理论教员并给教员以经常的帮助。业余理论学校除因单位较小或教员困难因而必须联合举办以外，一般干部较多的单位可以单独设立，这样既可节省干部奔走就学的时间，又便于结合各单位的具体情况进行教学并制订切合实际的制度。这样做法的困难就是所需聘请的教员数量较大。在目前情况下，由于专职教员来源很少，而且培养能够胜任的教员又非短期所能完成，所以，聘请兼职教员还是主要的方向。沈阳市委确定凡具有一定理论水平的党员干部必须担任教员，并把完成教学任务当做完成党的工作，这种规定是完全正确的。这样就把能够担任教员的力量大部分都组织进来了。由于参加中级组的干部理论水平较高，中级组的课程可由负责干部组成的讲师团担任（由于负责同志工作忙，讲课次数不宜过多）。对于相当多数的理论教员，除了一部分理论水平高备课能力强的同志以外，应由宣传部门大力加以帮助。许多地方在开学之前举办了教员训练班或研究班，例如华北局宣传部及华北各省省委宣传部所举办的党史理论教员研究班，沈阳市委宣传部所举办的政治常识教员训练班，武汉市委宣传部举办的政治常识讲座，使理论教员对所教的课程能在事前有充足的准备，或至少也可做到“边学边教”，已经证明是完全必要的。这一工作对提高教学质量起着极重要的作用。此外，为了提高教学讲课质量保证教学工作顺利进行，当地的党委宣传部应尽可能设立教学研究室供给教员讲课提纲和各种参考资料，帮助他们解答疑难问题，组织教员开教学研究会，交流经验及互相观摩等。必须指出，在目前条件下，对理论教员不能要求过高，主要应要求他们能够正确讲解课程内容，只有经过党委宣传部门大力帮助与教员自身不断的努力，才能逐渐把教学质量提高。在这一问题上，要求过高的急躁的态度是不对的，但消极等待教员自己成长或只使用而不帮助的态度同样是不对的。
    此外，为了加强对学习的辅导，各地还设立了许多学习辅导员，有的并对学习辅导员进行了训练。学习辅导员可以反映学员情况，帮助解决学习中的某些困难。这方面的经验尚待继续积累。
    第三、应该建立管理业余理论学校的专业机构和较严格的学习制度。业余理论学校的全市领导机构应有一定数量的专职干部负责日常工作，各单位联合设立的业余学校或单独设立的人数超过三百人的业余理论学校也应尽可能设立或指定一个专职干部担任日常工作，以免一般兼职干部因自身业务繁忙而照顾不过来。此外，由于在职干部的学习容易被工作挤掉，因此必须订立较严格的考勤、请假、考试等制度，才能帮助他们坚持学习和加强学习的效果。
    最后，干部业余理论学校设立时，应该先进行建立机构、聘请与训练教员、编写教学计划和参考资料、订立制度等具体准备工作。这些工作是必不可少的。如果毫无准备就仓促设立或全面铺开，就会发生教学质量低下、工作混乱的情况。另外，领导方面必须加强领导，以求逐渐加强业余学校的正规化。如果草率从事，或仅仅形式地把各单位多添上一个业余理论学校的空名，并不去提高它的实际工作内容，那是完全不应该的。
    目前，为了配合全国大规模的有计划的经济建设，必须加强在职干部的理论教育，并使之日益走向经常化。除了全国高级干部的理论学习已经在学习联共第十九次代表大会的文件和斯大林同志著作的过程中大为加强，并须继续经常坚持下去以外，全国省市级以上党委所在地及较中心的城市的党委宣传部，都应该有计划、有步骤地设立这种干部业余理论学校。这样就会有助于逐步地改变过去干部理论教育缺少组织制度的状态，把干部的马克思列宁主义的水平逐步提高。
