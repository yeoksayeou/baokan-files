Life of the Herdsmen of Tianshan
　　The northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains are a vast pasture with lush water and grass. Most of the hardworking Kazakh people live here, leading their nomadic lives.
　　Winter has arrived, and the herdsmen return to the winter pastures in the mountains, using the dense pine forests and high peaks around the valleys to block the cold currents. They also build warm wooden houses to spend the winter.
　　Herdsmen in Sulei County have built a 7,000-meter-long canal on the alpine pasture, which not only provides drinking water for cattle and sheep but can also irrigate 2,000 mu of land.
　　Veterinary workers dispatched by the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government to the pastoral areas are treating the lungworm disease of herdsman Awugen's sheep.
　　In order to help herdsmen breed fine-wool Lanhai sheep, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Animal Husbandry Department has established many artificial insemination stations in pastoral areas. Herdsman Ailun is driving his best sheep to the artificial insemination station for insemination.
　　Doctors from the medical team of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Pastoral Area Work Group are treating children of herdsmen.
　　In the past three years, thanks to the active assistance of the People's Government, the lives of the herdsmen have generally improved. The herdsmen of Nuerjia Township in Changji County specially selected the scenic Santun River and built a new primary school building so that the children can study here quietly.
　　Herdsmen's reading group in Sulei County is reading newspapers.
　　Paxi, a Kazakh woman from Changji County, puts on new clothes, rides a horse, and prepares to go to the movies.
　　Every year in summer and autumn, the herdsmen have to seize the time to shear wool.
　　In addition to being used for the herdsmen's own diet, dairy products in pastoral areas can also be made into dairy products and supplied to cities in large quantities. This is a Kazakh woman milking a cow.

   天山牧民的生活
   天山北麓是一片水草丰茂的广大牧区，勤劳的哈萨克族人民大都居住在这里，过着他们的畜牧生活。
    冬天来到了，牧民们回到山地冬季牧场来，借丛密的松林和山谷四周的高峰阻挡着寒流。他们并用木头修筑起温暖的小木屋来度过冬天。
    绥来县牧民们在高山牧场上修了一条七千公尺长的水渠，除供牛羊饮水外，并可浇地两千亩。
    新疆省人民政府派到牧区的兽医工作人员，在给牧民阿乌梗的羊群医治肺丝虫病。
    为了帮助牧民们繁殖细毛优良的兰哈绵羊，新疆省人民政府畜牧厅在牧区建立了许多人工授精站。牧民艾伦正赶着自己最好的羊群到人工授精站去授精。
    新疆省人民政府牧区工作团医疗队的医生，正在给牧民的孩子治病。
    三年多来，由于人民政府的积极帮助，牧民们的生活都普遍地提高了。昌吉县努尔迦乡的牧民们特意选定风景优美的三屯河边，修筑了一座小学新校舍，让孩子们可以安静地在这里学习。
    绥来县牧民读报组在读报。
    昌吉县哈萨克族妇女帕希穿起新衣，骑着马，准备去看电影。
    每年到了夏、秋两季，牧民们就要抓紧时间来剪羊毛。
    牧区乳类产品除供牧民们自己饮食外，并可制成乳制品，大量供应城市的需要。这是一位哈萨克族的妇女正在挤牛奶。
