    Sun Ke Ren, Head of Longkou City Horticultural Farm,
    Neglects Worker Safety and Resists Criticism
    
    Comrade Editor: Workers at the Longkou City Horticultural Farm often suffer injuries when applying whitewash (lime-sulfur mixture) to fruit trees, due to the chemicals accidentally entering their eyes. To ensure safety, workers at the farm have repeatedly requested the addition of protective equipment, but Sun Ke Ren, the head of the farm, has consistently refused to adopt this reasonable request. As a result, incidents of workers like Hu Shanruo and Yao Yunqian injuring their eyes have continued to occur. Furthermore, to prevent rabies (five or six people in Longkou City have already died from rabies after being bitten by rabid dogs), the Longkou City People's Representative Conference passed a resolution to kill all dogs in the winter of 1952. The Longkou City Horticultural Farm kept three dogs. Sun Ke Ren, the head of the farm, not only failed to comply with the resolution to kill the dogs, but also had the clerk buy five or six jin of cooked pig trotters to feed the dogs after the large dog gave birth to puppies. This behavior has caused dissatisfaction among the workers and nearby residents. Workers like Zhang Shirong criticized Sun Ke Ren's behavior on wall posters. The Longkou City Federation of Trade Unions, because Sun Ke Ren also served as the vice-chairman of the grassroots trade union, also raised concerns with him, but he consistently refused to accept them. We believe that Sun Ke Ren's behavior is wrong. He should conduct a self-criticism and correct this erroneous behavior.

    龙口市园艺场场长孙克仁
    忽视工人安全并抗拒批评
    编辑同志：山东龙口市园艺场的工人在给果树打白涂剂（石灰硫磺合剂）时，常有因药剂误入眼内而遭受伤害的。为了保障安全，场内工人曾一再提出添置若干防护用具的要求，但该场场长孙克仁对工人的这一合理要求，始终不予采纳，以致该场又连续发生工人胡善若、姚云千等误伤眼睛的事情。又，龙口市为了防止狂犬病（该市被狂犬咬伤致死的已有五、六人），市人民代表会议曾通过决议，要在一九五二年冬季把狗全部打死。龙口市园艺场养了三只狗，该场场长孙克仁不但不遵照决议把狗打死，反在大狗生小狗后让事务员买一付五、六斤重的猪蹄煮熟给狗吃。他的这种行为，引起了场内工人和附近居民的不满。对孙克仁的这种行为，工人张世容等曾在壁报上提出批评，龙口市总工会因为孙克仁兼任基层工会的副主席职务，也曾对他提出意见，但是他始终不肯接受。我们认为孙克仁的这种作法是不对的，他应该进行检讨，并改正这种错误行为。　徐从惠
