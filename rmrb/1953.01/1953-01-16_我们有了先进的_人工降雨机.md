    The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, drawing on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, has manufactured an "artificial rain machine." The success of this creation is not only of great help to our agricultural scientific research and experimental work, but also of extremely great significance to the irrigation cause of our entire country.
    "Artificial rainfall" is also known as "sprinkler irrigation." In the Soviet Union's irrigation cause, this method has been widely applied. The main characteristics of "sprinkler irrigation" are: first, it can save water and control the amount of water. Soviet experience has proven that it can save up to 50% of water usage. Controlling the amount of water is a major issue in irrigation methods, because the water requirements of crops at each stage of development are different. The "artificial rain machine" has the characteristic of controlling the amount of irrigation in its own structure, so we can accurately supply it with water according to the needs of the crops. Second, it can maintain soil structure and prevent soil alkalization. In irrigation, soil aggregate structure is often damaged due to flooding, and at the same time, the surface layer forms plate-like and cracked phenomena. "Sprinkler irrigation," on the other hand, causes water to fall from the air, with fine and uniform rain lines, which can maintain the good structure of the soil. In irrigated areas, soil alkalization is often caused by poor management. Applying the "sprinkler irrigation" method can prevent water from becoming groundwater, and at the same time, because it maintains the soil structure, it can effectively prevent soil alkalization. Third, it can preserve fertilizer. "Sprinkler irrigation" can prevent water from becoming groundwater at any time, which will greatly reduce the loss and penetration of fertilizer. Fourth, it can be applied to uneven fields, especially newly reclaimed fields. Fifth, it can increase yields. The land yield of "sprinkler irrigation" is more than twice as high as that of ditch irrigation. If the "sprinkler irrigation" method is applied to the cultivation of special crops and vegetables, it will have even more significant effects. According to the experiments of Soviet water conservancy expert Comrade Bukov, under normal conditions, applying "sprinkler irrigation" can obtain 15 kilograms (per plant) of cabbage in weight.
    Now we have manufactured the Keda Wu's low-pressure artificial rain machine. Its irrigation area can reach 25 hectares per quarter, and it can spray 65 metric tons of water per hour. The diameter of its spraying range can reach 10 meters. The main parts of the machine structure are: water pump, connecting cylinder, sprinkler pipe, nozzle, etc. The water pump has a caliber of 100 mm and requires a 10-horsepower machine to drive it. The sprinkler pipe has a caliber of 100 mm, each section is 5 meters long (a total of 40 sections, with a total length of 200 meters), and they are arranged in two rows for alternating spraying. The nozzle is made of light metal aluminum, with an upper opening of 75 mm. A cone with a height of 7 mm at a 45-degree angle is set 20 mm above the nozzle. The tip of the cone is used to cut the water into fine particles under high pressure and spray it out. The irrigation process is: first, a tractor drives the water pump to extract water from the water source, pass the water through the sprinkler pipe, guide the water to the nozzle of each section, and spray the water from the nozzle under high pressure, becoming fine rain lines that fall to the ground to irrigate the fields.
    Our achievements today are inseparable from the enthusiastic help of our closest friends, Soviet water conservancy experts Comrade Bukov and Comrade Ivanov. In the production process, we encountered many difficulties. The nozzle is the most important part of the rain machine and the most difficult to manufacture. If the nozzle is not well made, it will not be suitable for spraying requirements. Comrade Bukov enthusiastically and responsibly solved the nozzle manufacturing and many other problems for us. According to Comrade Bukov's design, we have manufactured the latest type of nozzle, sprinkler pipe, and connecting cylinder. We originally designed a cast iron nozzle, but it never met the spraying requirements. The nozzle designed by Comrade Bukov is a conical body made of light metal aluminum. An inverted cone is set in the center line of the upper opening of the cone. The tip of the cone is used to cut the water into extremely fine particles under high pressure and spray it out, and the rain lines are fine and completely meet the spraying requirements. The water volume sprayed by the sprinkler pipe he designed is more than doubled than ours, but the weight of the pipe is reduced, and it can save half of the manpower during use. As for the connecting cylinder, it is much lighter in weight than the one we designed, and the structure is also simpler. In solving these difficult problems, Comrade Bukov has always patiently and enthusiastically helped us, explaining in detail the principles of each structural part. After the machine was made, Comrade Bukov also came to us for inspection and provided us with many valuable suggestions.
    In the production process, we took detours due to the initial design being not thorough enough, and damaged about 1,000 catties of cast iron and cast copper. However, our leadership did not interrupt the research on the "artificial rain machine" because of this. On the contrary, they gave us support and encouragement. This is also an important reason why the "artificial rain machine" was able to be made.
    The production of the "artificial rain machine" is only the beginning of our agricultural scientific research work. In the future, we will continue to work hard to improve our research work.

    我们有了先进的“人工降雨机”
    华北农业科学研究所
    技术员　贾大林  技工　董金三  练习生　王权
    华北农业科学研究所吸取苏联的先进经验，制造了“人工降雨机”。这一制作的成功，不仅对我们的农业科学研究试验工作有重大的帮助，并且对我们整个国家的灌溉事业也同样具有极其重大的意义。
    “人工降雨”又称“喷雾灌溉”。在苏联的灌溉事业中，这种方法已经被广泛地应用了。“喷雾灌溉”的主要特点是：第一，它可以节省水量，并且能够控制水量。苏联的经验证明，它可以节省用水量达百分之五十。控制水量乃是灌溉方法上的主要问题，因为作物的每个发育阶段的需水量是不同的。“人工降雨机”在本身的构造上就具有掌握灌水量的特性，因此我们完全可以依照作物的需要而准确地供给它以水量。第二，它可以保持土壤结构及防止土壤的碱化。在灌溉中往往由于漫灌而使土壤团粒结构受到破坏，同时使表层形成板状和龟裂的现象。而“喷雾灌溉”则因水从空中降下，雨线细密而均匀，便可以保持土壤的优良结构。在灌溉区，往往因管理得不好而引起土壤的碱化作用。应用“喷雾灌溉”的方法，可以使水不变成地下水，同时又因为保持了土壤结构，因此就很有效地防止了土壤的碱化作用。第三，可以保存肥料。 “喷雾灌溉”既可以使水在任何时候都不能变成地下水，就会大大减少肥料的流失和渗透现象。第四，它可以应用到高低不平的田地上，尤其是新开垦的田地。第五，它可以增加产量。“喷雾灌溉”的土地产量要比沟渠灌溉的土地产量高出一倍以上。如果将“喷雾灌溉”的方法应用到特种作物及蔬菜的栽培上，更有显著的效果。据苏联水利专家布可夫同志的试验，在一般条件下，应用“喷雾灌溉”可获得重量十五公斤（每棵）的甘蓝。
    现在我们制成的是克达乌氏低压人工降雨机。它的灌溉面积，每季度可达二十五公顷，每小时可喷射六十五公吨的水量，它喷射的范围直径可达十公尺。机器构造的主要部分有：抽水机、联接筒、洒水导管、喷头等。抽水机，口径一百公厘，需十马力的机器带动。洒水导管，口径一百公厘，每段五公尺（共计四十段，全长二百公尺），分两行并列轮换喷射。喷头，是以轻金属铝制成的，上口七十五公厘。在喷水口上二十公厘处设置一个七公厘高度成四十五度角的圆锥体，利用其尖端将水在高压下切成微细的粒子喷射出去。灌溉过程是：首先以拖拉机带动抽水机，将水从水源抽出，通过洒水导管，将水导至每段的喷头，在高压下将水从喷头喷射出去，成为细密的雨线降达地面，以灌溉田地。
    我们今天的成果，是和我们最亲密的朋友苏联水利专家布可夫同志以及伊凡诺夫同志的热诚帮助分不开的。在制作过程中，我们曾碰到过许许多多的困难。喷头是降雨机的最重要的部分，最难制造。如果喷头做得不好，就不适合喷射要求。布可夫同志曾热诚地、负责地给我们解决了喷头制作以及其他的许多问题。我们按着布可夫同志的设计，制成了最新型的喷头、洒水导管及联接筒等。我们自己原来设计的是铸铁喷头，始终达不到喷射要求。布可夫同志设计的喷头是用轻金属的铝制成的锥形体。在锥形体上口中线设一倒置圆锥体，利用锥体的尖端在高压下将水切成极微细的粒子喷射出去，雨线细密，完全合乎喷射要求。他所设计的喷水导管在喷射的水量上比我们的增加一倍以上，而导管的重量却减轻了，在使用时又可节省一半的人力。至于联接筒，在重量上比我们设计的要轻得多，在构造上也比较简单。在解决这些困难问题中，布可夫同志始终是耐心地热诚地帮助我们，详细解释每个构造部分的原理。机器制成后，布可夫同志还亲自来我们这里进行检查，并给我们提供了许多宝贵的意见。
    在制作中，我们因最初设计得不周密，走了弯路，曾损坏了一千斤左右的铸铁及铸铜。但我们的领导方面，并不因此而中断“人工降雨机”的研究，相反地却给我们以支持和鼓励。这也是“人工降雨机”能够制成的重要原因。
    “人工降雨机”的制作，只是我们农业科学研究工作的开始，今后我们将继续努力改进我们的研究工作。
