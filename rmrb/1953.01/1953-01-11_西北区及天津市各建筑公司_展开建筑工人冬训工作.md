Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th—The Northwest Construction Engineering Company has fixed 6,000 technical workers, who began winter training at the end of December in the Xi'an and Xianyang areas. The leadership of the Northwest Construction Engineering Company established a Winter Training Working Committee in early December to specifically lead the winter training work. The sixty instructors responsible for the winter training were drawn from the captains, technicians, engineers, and personnel section chiefs of various engineering teams; the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions also dispatched sixty cadres to participate in political guidance work. The workers' centralized learning adopts the step of political learning first, followed by technology. Political learning takes the form of listening to general reports and group discussions, so that workers can improve their class consciousness and establish a sense of being masters of the country through their own experiences. Technical learning mainly focuses on parallel flow operation methods and organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts; it also focuses on summarizing advanced technical operation experience of various trades. They also adopted lively and specific educational methods such as advanced producer performances for teaching.
    
This Dispatch: More than 13,000 construction workers in Tianjin have participated in winter training. After this stage of political study, the class consciousness of the trainees has generally improved.

    After the start of the winter training for construction workers in Tianjin, many units held winter training mobilization meetings to explain the purpose and importance of this training to the workers. Then, according to the teaching plan of the Tianjin Municipal Basic Construction Workers Winter Training Committee, they conducted large lectures and group discussions. The Tianjin Municipal Construction Trade Union also convened a meeting of advanced construction worker Fu Hongbin and others, mobilizing them to actively take the lead in learning during the winter training. At present, construction workers in general units have completed courses such as "Class and Class Struggle" and "The Communist Party of China". Units such as the Worker Construction Company also held construction worker grievance meetings. At group discussions and grievance meetings, many workers bitterly recounted the various sufferings they had endured in the past from the oppression and exploitation of landlords, Japanese imperialism, and the Kuomintang bandits. After studying the course "Class and Class Struggle," worker Jiang Shixi of the Worker Construction Company bitterly recounted at the grievance meeting the cruel exploitation he suffered from feudal landlords in the past, how his father was forced to death by debts, and how he himself suffered from the persecution of feudal overseers and Kuomintang bandits. He said: In the past, the lines between the enemy and ourselves were blurred. It was only through this study that I truly understood clearly. He also pledged at the meeting that he would abide by the learning discipline and study hard during the winter training to improve his political and technical level to meet the country's large-scale planned basic construction tasks. Many workers who recounted their grievances poured out their past sufferings with every word and tear, increasing the hatred of all the trainees for the old society and class enemies and their love for the new society. After this period of political study and grievance, the class consciousness of the trainees has generally improved, and their learning attitude has generally become more correct. Many brigades, squadrons, and groups of units such as the North China Directly Subordinate Second Engineering Company and the Worker Construction Company have formulated patriotic learning covenants, guaranteeing to obey leadership, abide by learning discipline, speak enthusiastically, and conduct criticism and self-criticism. Many groups also launched friendly challenges and responses to each other. In the past, some workers had unstable learning emotions, wanted to go home, and had poor learning discipline, but now this situation has changed. Some construction workers have also raised requests to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

    At present, the following problems still exist in Tianjin's winter training work that need to be resolved: (1) Some political instructors' lectures are not easy to understand, using obscure language that workers cannot understand. For example, when a worker asked "What is politics?", the instructor said: "The sum of class struggle is politics." The worker understood even less. (2) The leading cadres of some units do not pay enough attention to the winter training work and have not selected capable cadres to be responsible for leading the winter training work; the organizational structure of the leading winter training work in some units is not sound enough; although there are organizations, there is no one specifically responsible, so organizational leadership and ideological leadership are relatively weak. (3) The leading cadres of some units do not take enough care of the living welfare of construction workers. For example, a squadron of the Worker Construction Company only has one water bottle, and the workers cannot get water to drink. The workers have opinions on the living welfare facilities, but the company's leadership has not yet found a way to improve them. There are very few medical personnel in many units, and sick workers often have to wait a day to see a doctor. (4) There are not enough counselors in the winter training in many units, and the political level of the counselors is not high enough, making it difficult for them to fulfill their due responsibilities.

### 西北区及天津市各建筑公司  展开建筑工人冬训工作

    西北区及天津市各建筑公司
    展开建筑工人冬训工作
    【新华社西安九日电】西北建筑工程公司固定下来的六千个技术工人，已在去年十二月底分别在西安、咸阳两地区开始冬季训练。西北建筑工程公司领导方面在去年十二月初就成立了冬训工作委员会，专门负责领导冬训工作。担任冬训的六十个教员，是由各工程队队长、技师、技术员、人事科长中抽调出来的；西北总工会也调派了六十个干部参加政治辅导工作。工人的集中学习采取先政治后技术的步骤。政治学习采取听大报告和小组讨论的方式，以便工人从切身经验中来提高阶级觉悟，树立国家主人翁的思想。技术学习主要学习平行流水作业法、按指示图表组织有节奏生产等先进方法；同时也注重总结各工种先进技术操作经验。他们并采用了先进生产者表演会等生动具体的教育方式，进行教学。
    【本报讯】天津市建筑工人已有一万三千多人参加了冬季训练。经过这一个阶段的政治学习，受训工人的阶级觉悟普遍提高了一步。
    天津市建筑工人冬训工作开始以后，许多单位都分别召开了冬季训练动员大会，对工人讲清了这次训练的目的与重要性，然后按照天津市基本建设工人冬季训练委员会的教学计划，进行上大课和小组讨论。天津市建筑工会并曾召集建筑工人先进工作者傅鸿宾等开会，动员他们在冬训中积极带头学习。目前，一般单位的建筑工人都学完了“阶级与阶级斗争”、“中国共产党”等课程。工人建筑公司等单位还举行了建筑工人诉苦大会。许多工人在小组讨论会上和诉苦大会上，痛诉了自己过去遭受地主、日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮压迫和剥削的种种苦楚。工人建筑公司工人姜士喜在学习了“阶级和阶级斗争”课程后，在诉苦大会上痛诉了过去受封建地主的残酷剥削，父亲活活被债务逼死，自己又受封建把头和国民党匪帮的迫害等苦处。他说：过去长时期，敌我界限模糊，通过这次学习，才真正认识清楚了。他在会上并提出保证，一定要在冬训期间，遵守学习纪律好好学习，提高自己的政治和技术水平，来迎接国家大规模的有计划的基本建设任务。许多诉苦的工人，都一字一泪地诉出了自己过去的苦楚，使全体受训工人增加了对旧社会和阶级敌人的憎恨和对新社会的热爱。经过这一段的政治学习和诉苦，受训工人的阶级觉悟普遍提高，学习态度也普遍端正起来。华北直属第二工程公司、工人建筑公司等单位许多大队、中队和小组都订立了爱国学习公约，保证服从领导，遵守学习纪律，热烈发言，展开批评和自我批评。许多小组并互相展开了友谊的挑战与应战。过去有些工人学习情绪不安定，想回家，学习纪律不好，现在这种情况都已改变。有些建筑工人并提出了参加共产党和青年团的要求。
    目前，天津市冬训工作还存在着下列几个问题，需要解决：（一）有些政治教员讲课不通俗，咬文嚼字，工人听不懂。如有工人问“什么叫政治”，教员说：“阶级斗争的总合，即是政治。”工人越发不懂了。（二）有的单位领导干部对冬训工作重视不够，没有选派得力干部来负责领导冬训工作；有的单位领导冬训工作的组织机构还不够健全；有的虽有组织，但没有专人负责，因而组织领导与思想领导比较薄弱。（三）有的单位领导干部对建筑工人生活福利照顾不够。如工人建筑公司一个中队只有一把水壶，工人喝不到水。工人对生活福利设施有意见，但该公司领导方面直到现在还没有设法加以改进。有很多单位的医务人员很少，生病的工人往往要等上一天才能看病。（四）不少单位冬训中的辅导员不够，而且辅导员的政治水平不高，很难负起应尽的责任。
