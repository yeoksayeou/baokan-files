    Soviet Films Educate Chinese Audiences
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Soviet films are warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese people, and have become an indispensable spiritual food in the lives of the Chinese people. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," according to preliminary statistics, more than 100 million people in our country watched Soviet films and received profound education. We have recently received a series of letters from readers, talking about their feelings and gains after watching Soviet films. Zhang Xiuyun, a sixteen-year-old girl from the western suburbs of Beijing, is an orphan with no parents, now working. She is full of admiration and love for the Soviet Union and Stalin. When she watched the film "The Unforgettable Year 1919," this feeling became even stronger. She said: "I forgot I was watching a movie. I only thought I was sitting next to Stalin, watching him do everything with my own eyes, and listening to his every word. He really touched my heart. I wish I could hug him at once. If I could hug him, I would say to him: 'Comrade Stalin, you have pointed out a path for the people of the world, a path that is so bright and so happy! How much I admire you!'" She recalled that in the past she often thought of herself as the most miserable orphan, homeless and jobless, like a person trapped in a mud pit unable to pull her legs out. She was very distressed, often crying about her bad luck, and felt that she had no hope. She no longer thinks that way now. She is very happy now, determined to study hard and prepare to serve the construction of the motherland. She said: "Under the banner of Mao Zedong and Stalin, there is no unhappy person. The film 'The Unforgettable Year 1919' tells us that people's happiness must be fought for, not dropped from the sky." This girl's feelings for Comrade Stalin, the mentor and friend of the people of the world, are shared by the vast number of Chinese audiences. Whenever the image of Comrade Stalin appears on the screen, the audience applauds and cheers with great enthusiasm. This is a very common phenomenon.
    Gu Zhong, a worker in Shenyang, wrote that people were talking with great interest: "Soviet films are so good, and so educational for us!" Many people were moved by the magnificent historical scene after watching "The Unforgettable Year 1919"; the image of the wise and decisive Stalin is unforgettable.
    The Soviet film "The Revolutionary Cradle - Vyborg District" is also very educational. Yang Baozhang from the Beijing Electric Power Bureau wrote that this film solved a problem in his thinking. He used to be a worker, but in 1951 he was transferred to be a staff member due to work needs. He said: "A worker who is used to running around on the spot suddenly sits in the office, and it is really not a habit. Every day seems longer than before, and I always feel that the sun sets slowly, and it feels like there are thorns stuck in my butt." Because of his low level of education, he always felt a little inferior. Once, he was asked to notify a comrade to attend a meeting, and he wrote a note and mistakenly wrote "meeting" (碰头会 - pèngtóuhuì) as "crashing heads meeting" (撞头会 - zhuàngtóuhuì). This incident added to his unease as a staff member. Maxim, in the Soviet film "The Revolutionary Cradle - Vyborg District," was also a worker who was later appointed as Minister of Finance. He overcame various difficulties and completed his tasks well. This spirit educated him and increased his confidence in working as a staff member.
    Wang Ninghe from Jinan Industrial Technology School in Shandong wrote that after watching the Soviet film "In the Days of Peace," he was moved by the bravery and the spirit of overcoming difficulties of the Soviet sailors. He said: "In the past, I always bowed my head to difficulties. When I was learning technical courses, because I couldn't understand math, physics, and chemistry, I emphasized that my body was 'too weak' and couldn't persevere, and asked not to study anymore. The principal agreed to me and transferred me to another job, but when I encountered difficulties, I was uneasy again. After watching the film, my thinking changed. I am determined to overcome any difficulties in my work."
    Zong Shan from the Xuzhou Second Cultural Center wrote that during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the city of Xuzhou had more than 290,000 moviegoers (the city has a population of 300,000). "Soviet films have aroused a strong desire among the masses to love the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union." A porter said: "Pulling carts is not a lifelong thing." In the past, they did not do well in their studies, but now everyone is asking to set up spare-time schools, and the enthusiasm for learning is very high. They pull carts on the road, while walking and reciting phonetic symbols to learn Pinyin. In the past, they thought that work was for "earning 20,000 yuan a day," but now they say: "Why do we work? We work for socialism. The Soviet Union helps us so enthusiastically, why shouldn't we work? Work harder, and socialism will arrive!"

    苏联电影教育着中国观众
    ——读者来信综述
    苏联电影在中国受到广大人民的热烈欢迎，它已经成为中国人民生活中不可缺少的精神食粮。在“中苏友好月”中，据初步统计，我国有一亿多人次的观众看了苏联影片，受到了深刻的教育。我们最近陆续收到一些读者来信，谈到他们看苏联影片后的感想和收获。北京西郊有个十六岁的张秀云，她是个无爹无妈、孤苦伶仃的女孩子，现在已经参加了工作。她对苏联、对斯大林充满了敬慕和热爱的感情，当她看“难忘的一九一九年”影片时，这种感情更加浓了。她说：“我忘记了我是在看电影，我只想着我是坐在斯大林的身旁，亲眼看斯大林作每一件事，听他说每一句话。他真打动我的心，我恨不能一下子抱住他。我要能抱住他的话，我一定向他说：‘斯大林同志，是你给世界人民指出了一条路，这条路是多光明多幸福啊！我是多么敬爱你呀！’”她回忆过去常常想到自己是一个最苦的孤儿，无家又无业，人像陷在一个污泥坑里拔不出腿来，她非常痛苦，时常哭自己的命不好，觉得自己没什么希望了。她现在已经不那样想了，她现在非常愉快，下决心好好学习，准备为祖国的建设服务。她说：“在毛泽东、斯大林的旗帜下，没有不幸福的人。‘难忘的一九一九年’影片就告诉我们：人的幸福是要争取的，不是从天上掉下来的。”这个女孩子对世界人民的导师和朋友斯大林同志的感情，是中国广大观众所共有的。银幕上只要一出现斯大林同志的形象，观众便以极大的热情鼓掌和欢呼，这是很普遍的现象。
    沈阳工人顾众来信说，人们以极大的兴趣谈论着：“苏联电影太好啦，对咱们的教育太大啦！”许多人看了“难忘的一九一九年”后，都为那雄伟的历史图景所感动；英明、果敢的斯大林的形象使人永远不能忘记。
    苏联电影“革命摇篮维堡区”给人的教育也很大。北京电业局杨宝璋来信说，这部电影给他解决了一个思想问题。他原来是个工人，一九五一年因工作需要被调作职员。他说：“一个在现场跑惯了的工人，忽然坐办公室，实在不习惯，每天的时间像比以前长的多，总觉得太阳落的慢，屁股上像扎着刺。”因为他的文化程度不高，所以他总有点自卑。有一次别人让他通知一位同志开碰头会，他写了个条子竟错写成开“撞头会”，这件事更增添了他作职员的不安。苏联电影“革命摇篮维堡区”中的马克辛原也是个工人，后被委派作财政部长，克服种种困难，很好地完成了任务，这种精神教育了他，使他对作职员工作增加了信心。
    山东济南工业技术学校王宁和来信说，他看了苏联影片“在和平的日子里”后，被苏联水兵们的英勇、克服困难的精神所感动。他说：“我过去老是向困难低头，我学技术课时，因我的数学、物理和化学啃不通，就强调身体‘太弱’，坚持不了，要求不学了，校长答应了我，调我作别的工作，但一遇到困难，就又不安心了。看了影片，我的思想转变了，我要下决心克服工作中的任何困难。”
    徐州市第二文化馆纵山来信说，“中苏友好月”内，徐州市的电影观众有二十九万多（该市人口三十万），“苏联电影激起了群众更加热爱苏联、向苏联学习的强烈心情”。一个搬运工人说：“拉平车也不是一辈子的事。”过去他们的学习搞不好，现在大家都要求办业余学校，学习情绪很高。他们在马路上拉着车子，一边走一边还念着注音符号学拼音。过去他们认为工作是为“一天挣两万元”，现在他们说：“为啥干，为社会主义干，苏联这么热情帮助咱，咱为啥还不干，加加油社会主义就到啦！”
