    Decision of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau to Expel Anti-Party Element Huang Yifeng from the Party
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Huang Yifeng (Communist Party member), the Minister of the Communications Department of the East China Military and Political Committee and concurrently the President of the East China Transportation College, suppressed mass criticism and seriously violated Party discipline. After the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau sent an inspection team to conduct an in-depth investigation, the anti-Party crimes of Huang Yifeng and others were completely proven (the facts are detailed on page three of today's newspaper). On the 13th of this month, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau issued a "Decision on Punishing Relevant Leading Personnel for the Incident of Suppressing Student Criticism at the East China Transportation College," giving Huang Yifeng the punishment of expulsion from the Party and recommending that the East China Administrative Committee report to the Central People's Government to remove Huang Yifeng from all administrative positions. Relevant personnel who committed evils with Huang Yifeng were also subjected to Party disciplinary action. The following is the full text of the decision of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau:
    I. Decision on Expelling Anti-Party Element Huang Yifeng from the Party
    Huang Yifeng, the former Minister of the Communications Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, the Secretary of the Party Group of the Department, and concurrently the President of the East China Transportation College, after the People's Daily published an article on December 3, 1951, written under the pseudonym of Xue Chengfeng, a student of the school, entitled "Disorderly Phenomena Exist in the East China Transportation College," did not humbly accept the true and reasonable parts of the mass criticism to improve the work of the school. On the contrary, he expressed indignation and vehemently slandered the author of the article as a "saboteur" at a meeting of the school's Communist Youth League and activists. He publicly stated that he had gone to investigate the author and instructed school leaders to mobilize some teachers, students, and staff to come forward and demand correction from the People's Daily through Party, government, labor union, and Youth League organizations, in order to protest and counterattack the criticism from the Party newspaper. Subsequently, through Jiang Zhenhong, the personnel secretary of the school's president's office, he stole the school branch's name and sent a letter to the People's Daily, falsely claiming that the school branch agreed with the statement of employees and students in order to deceive the People's Daily's trust. He took a series of retaliatory measures against the author. After the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee repeatedly refused to approve the expulsion of Xue Chengfeng from school, he still insisted on his own opinion, defied the instructions of his superiors, held ideological remolding conferences, violated the principles of ideological remolding, and arbitrarily organized the masses to accuse and struggle against the author, forcing Xue to write an application for withdrawal from school. He also wrote letters to Xue's parents twice in the name of the school, falsely claiming that Xue's "old illness had recurred" and that he was "mentally disturbed," asking them to take Xue back, in order to achieve the purpose of driving Xue away, demonstrating a treacherous and retaliatory two-faced approach to the author. During the process of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau sending an inspection team to the school to investigate and handle this incident, Huang Yifeng demonstrated the bad qualities of concealing information from above and deceiving those below, resisting inspection, and being extremely disloyal to the Party. Initially, he arranged for so-called "unified understanding" and tried to cover up the true facts of the errors in many ways. In order to educate Huang Yifeng, the Party repeatedly convened meetings and held individual talks with him, but Huang publicly attacked comrades who exposed his erroneous facts at the meetings. In his capacity as the person being investigated, he arrogantly made summarizing speeches, and slandered the Party's inspection as affecting the work of the school. Finally, in the face of undeniable facts, he still repeatedly quibbled everywhere, trying to shirk responsibility, with no intention of repentance. The above errors prove that Huang Yifeng did not follow the central government's instructions to "adopt a warm welcome and resolute protection of the revolutionary attitude" towards criticism from the masses. On the contrary, he adopted a bad attitude of retaliating against critics, which suffocated bottom-up criticism in the school and undermined the close relationship between the Party and the masses. During the Party's inspection and handling process, he also committed serious errors of concealing information from above and deceiving those below, disregarding organization, and being extremely disloyal to the Party. Furthermore, it has been verified through investigation that Huang Yifeng's anti-Party acts of suppressing criticism and retaliating against critics have occurred more than once. For example, during the Three-Anti Movement, Huang retaliated against comrades such as Li Xuemin and Li Limin, who bravely and publicly exposed the incomplete Three-Anti Movement in the East China Communications Department, by using the expanded meeting of the Party Group of the Department to attack them, arbitrarily scolding Li and others for undermining his "reputation" and "committing errors of disorganization and indiscipline." He also illegally revoked Comrade Li Xuemin's qualifications as a representative to the East China Military and Political Committee's Party Congress. These facts fully expose the extremely bad nature of Huang Yifeng and that he has developed to an incurable stage. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline, purify the Party organization, and educate the whole Party, it is specifically decided to give Huang Yifeng the punishment of expulsion from the Party.
    II. Decision on Punishing Other Relevant Leading Personnel
    (1) Comrade Jiang Zhenhong was the personnel secretary of the principal's office of the East China Transportation College at the time, the secretary of the Youth League General Branch, and is currently the deputy section chief of the personnel section of the personnel department of the East China Transportation Department. Jiang personally participated in the arrangement of a series of erroneous measures taken by the school against the author Xue Chengfeng, and signed her name with the masses, demanding correction from the People's Daily. This time, Jiang was assigned by Huang Yifeng to participate in the inspection team of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the East China Bureau as a member, and not only did she not actively report the situation truthfully, but she also prevented other comrades from handing over relevant materials to the inspection team. She also pretended to read the record of Huang Yifeng's speech at the Youth League and Activists meeting of the school, which the inspection team had already obtained, and took it to another room to secretly tear it up. Although the inspection team discovered it at the time and questioned her, and other comrades from the school truthfully accused her, she was arrogantly adamant and denied it until she reluctantly admitted it more than ten days later when checking the materials. The above points all seriously violated Party discipline and inspection work discipline. After repeated Party education, until a conclusion was made, Comrade Jiang Zhenhong still could not face her own mistakes and humbly conduct a review, and distorted the facts, trying in every possible way to deny and shirk responsibility, showing extreme disloyalty to the Party. However, considering that her mistakes were mainly caused under the erroneous leadership of Huang Yifeng, and that her own political understanding was relatively naive, in order to give her a final opportunity to be tested, it is specifically decided to leniently give her the punishment of probation within the Party for two years.
    (2) Comrade Yin Jianqiang was the deputy director of teaching affairs of the East China Transportation College at the time and the highest-ranking cadre among the Party members of the school. Yin not only failed to adhere to the correct position on a series of erroneous measures taken by the school regarding the Xue Chengfeng incident but instead participated in it without principle and signed her name with the masses, demanding correction from the People's Daily. Her erroneous behavior was also serious, but under the repeated enlightenment and education of the Party, she was able to face her mistakes and actively report the situation to help the inspection team carry out its work. It is specifically decided to give her a public warning within the Party.
    (3) Comrade Lu Xun was a personnel staff member of the principal's office of the East China Transportation College at the time (under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Zhenhong), and the secretary of the Party branch within the Party. She also participated in the action of suppressing the author without principle and signed her name with the masses, demanding correction from the People's Daily. Her mistake was also serious, but under the help and education of the Party, she was able to face her mistake. It is specifically decided to leniently give her a public admonition within the Party.

    中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会决定
    开除反党分子黄逸峰的党籍
    【本报讯】华东军政委员会交通部部长兼华东交通专科学校校长黄逸峰（共产党员），压制群众批评，严重违反党的纪律，经中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会派出检查组，深入进行检查的结果，完全证明了黄逸峰等反党的罪恶（事实经过见今日本报第三版）。本月十三日，中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会发出“关于华东交通专科学校压制学生批评事件对有关领导人员处分的决定”，予黄逸峰以开除党籍的处分，并建议华东行政委员会呈报中央人民政府撤销黄逸峰的一切行政职务。与黄逸峰共同作恶的有关人员，也受到党纪处分。以下就是中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会的决定全文：
    一、关于开除反党分子黄逸峰党籍的决定
    原华东军政委员会交通部部长、该部中共党组书记并兼华东交通专科学校校长黄逸峰，在一九五一年十二月三日人民日报刊载该校学生薛承凤化名所写“华东交通专科学校存在混乱现象”一文后，并未虚心地接受群众批评中真实的合理的部分，用以改进学校工作，相反的，却表示气愤，在该校青年团及积极分子会议上，情绪激动地污蔑投稿者为“破坏分子”，公然声称已去追查投稿人，并指使学校领导干部通过党、政、工、团组织，鼓动一部分师生员工出面要求人民日报更正，以此来抗议并反击党报的批评，随后，又通过该校校长办公室人事秘书蒋震虹盗用学校支部名义给人民日报去信，诈称学校支部同意职工及学生的声明，以骗取人民日报的信任。对写稿者则采取了一系列的打击措施，在华东军政委员会教育部一再不批准开除薛承凤学籍后，仍坚持己见，违抗上级指示，召开思想改造大会，违犯思想改造的方针，擅自组织群众对写稿者控诉斗争，迫令薛写退学申请书，并两次以学校名义写信告薛的家长，诈称薛的“旧病复发”，“神经失常”，要其将薛领回，以期达到将薛撵走的目的，表现了对投稿者阴险报复的两面手段。在华东局纪律检查委员会派检查组前往该校检查及处理此一事件过程中，黄逸峰则表现了瞒上欺下拒抗检查、对党极不忠诚的恶劣品质，初则布置所谓“统一认识”，多方掩盖错误真相，党为了教育黄逸峰曾多次召集会议及对其进行个别谈话，但黄却在会议上公然打击揭发其错误事实的同志，以被检查者身份，狂妄地作总结性的发言，并污蔑党的检查影响了学校的工作，最后在无可否认的事实面前，仍一再到处强词夺理叫嚣狡辩，推卸责任，毫无悔改之意。以上错误，证明黄逸峰对来自群众的批评并非遵照中央指示“采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度”，相反地却采取了对批评者实行打击报复恶劣态度，以致在学校中窒息了由下而上的批评，破坏了党与群众的密切联系；在党检查处理过程中，又犯了严重的瞒上欺下、目无组织、对党极不忠实的错误。另经检查证实，黄逸峰这种压制批评、打击报复批评者的反党恶行，已不止一次，如在三反运动中，黄对勇于公开揭发华东交通部三反运动不彻底的李学民、李利民等同志，即曾藉该部中共党组扩大会议予以打击报复，蛮横地叱责李等是破坏他的“名誉”，是“犯了无组织无纪律的错误”；并非法地撤销李学民同志的华东军政委员会中共党代表会议代表资格，这些事实，都充分地暴露了黄逸峰的本质极为恶劣，并已发展到不可救药的地步。为了严肃党的纪律纯洁党的组织并教育全党，特决定给予黄逸峰以开除党籍的处分。
    二、对其他有关领导人员的处分决定
    （一）蒋震虹同志为当时华东交通专科学校校长办公室人事秘书，青年团总分支书记，现任华东交通部人事处人事科副科长。学校方面对投稿人薛承凤一系列的错误措施，蒋均亲身参加布置，并以职工面目同群众一起签名要求人民日报更正。此次蒋被黄逸峰指派参加华东局纪律检查委员会检查组为组员，不仅不主动据实反映情况，且阻止其他同志将有关材料交与检查组；并将检查组已得到的黄逸峰在该校青年团及积极分子会议上的讲话记录，假装阅读，带往另室秘密撕毁，当时虽经检查组发觉向其质问，并有该校其他同志据实指责，竟然态度狂妄，矢口抵赖，直到十多天后核对材料时始勉强承认。以上各点，均严重的违犯了党的纪律与检查工作纪律，经过党的多次教育，直至做了结论，蒋震虹同志仍不能正视自己的错误虚心进行检讨，并歪曲事实，百般抵赖，推卸责任，表现对党极不忠实，但考虑到其所犯错误主要是在黄逸峰的错误领导下产生的，其本人政治认识比较幼稚；为了给予最后考验的机会，特决定从宽给以留党察看二年的处分。
    （二）印建强同志为当时华东交通专科学校教导副主任，系该校党员中行政职务最高者，该校对薛承凤事件的一系列错误措施，印不仅未曾坚持正确立场，反而无原则地参与其事，并以职工面目同群众一起签名，要求人民日报更正。其错误行为，也是严重的，但在党的屡次启发教育之下，尚能正视自己的错误、积极反映情况，帮助检查组进行工作，特决定给予党内当众警告处分。
    （三）鲁训同志为当时华东交通专科学校校长办公室人事工作人员（属蒋震虹同志领导），党内为支部书记，亦无原则地参与压制投稿人的行动，并以职工面目同群众一起签名要求人民日报更正，其错误亦是严重的，但他在党的帮助教育之下，尚能正视自己的错误，特决定从宽给予党内当众劝告的处分。
