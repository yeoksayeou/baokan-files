    The Engineering Company of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry began preparing for winter training of various cadres and workers in October last year, and classes started universally in early December. After more than a month of study, the trainees' learning enthusiasm changed from low at the beginning to high, and their political understanding and ideological level have improved significantly. They generally requested to study more politics, and some even applied to join the Party. In the opening exam, none of the one hundred people in the construction worker class answered the question "What is the Communist Party?" correctly, but by the end of the third political lesson exam, the average score of the whole class reached over 80 points. The workers' thinking has changed greatly. Their winter training work is still continuing enthusiastically. The winter training work of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Administration Engineering Company for more than a month has the following experiences:

    I. At the beginning of winter training, carrying out sufficient political work, implementing the policy of mobilizing the workers and masses ideologically, and stabilizing the trainees' emotions is a very important step. At the beginning of the training class, many people were unwilling to participate in the study, and some wanted to go home to "hibernate." They said, "We are outside for three seasons of the year, and we should go home when it freezes." Older people with low levels of education had no confidence in learning. Some wanted to ask for leave to go home, and if they were not allowed, they would "leave without saying goodbye." More than 300 people left out of the 1,200 people gathered in the Second Engineering Office, and 12 people from the Materials Class left secretly. The trainees showed boredom and lack of energy in their studies, and did not speak at the discussion meetings. The training class initially focused on clarifying thinking and improving learning enthusiasm as its central task. They adopted the method of organizing "recollection meetings." When teaching the first lesson, "Comparison of the Life in the New and Old Societies," they organized the workers to recall the suffering of the old society. This method of class education aroused the hatred of all trainees for the old society and their love for the new society, effectively stabilizing their reluctance to study. Master Guo, a cement worker from the first construction site of the Fifth Engineering Office, recalled the tragic story of his father being forced by landlords and officials to cut off his ten toes. He immediately stated in front of more than 500 classmates: "I must study hard, avenge my father, and serve the people."

    The training class also adopted a combination of general education and individual education, organizing cadres to go to groups to educate workers with their own experiences and life experiences, explaining the major relationship and significance of learning and national construction to them, mobilizing and organizing advanced classes and teams to report their gains to workers in other classes and teams, and driving backward classes and groups. In order to persuade those relatively backward trainees, the cadres went to the groups to conduct patient individual conversations. The old worker Qu Shixian was initially unwilling to study. When he was mobilized to study, he glared his eyes and said: "I don't study. I've worked hard for a year, and you still want me to study. I'm determined to go home and rest to catch my breath." The teacher went to the dormitory to talk to him, starting from the current living conditions, and when he talked about his luggage, he said: "Oh, double mattress and double quilts!" The old worker proudly added: "Three brand new sets inside and out!" This aroused his thoughts: he didn't even have an old quilt to cover when he got married, but now life is so happy. A fierce struggle arose in his heart. At another discussion meeting, he said: "Now I understand why I'm studying. I'm determined to study hard and work for the motherland."

    II. In order to stabilize the learning mood of the trainees and improve learning efficiency, the training class used blackboards, movies, slides and other weapons to vigorously carry out recreational activities. In addition, improving the living system to normalize life is also an important task. In recreational activities, the training class adopted the method of "workers playing workers." The workers sorted out and typified the materials they encountered and contacted around them, and performed them themselves, which was very effective. The Fifth Engineering Office has now organized twelve performance teams, with 270 people participating, creating and writing more than 30 programs of various sizes, including fast rhythmic talk, singing, and short plays. The content mainly describes the comparison between the old and new societies, and also combines the current study to select various types of typical figures in the study to show. The workers felt very close to these works, so the effect was very good. For example, when studying the second lesson, each construction site performed the drama "My Memories Ten Years Ago" created by worker Liu Zhenwu. After watching the play, many workers cried bitterly about the experience of the protagonist Sun Fu. Broadcaster Xiao Zhang couldn't watch it anymore and cried on the table. As the old bricklayer Zhang Enxi said: "This play is very touching. In the old society, we were apprentices and didn't respect anyone at all. We were beaten and scolded and couldn't learn skills! We used to be the same as him (referring to the person in the play)." In order to go deep into the workshop to mobilize the masses, and to reflect and guide the current work more quickly and specifically, the training class also adopted the method of performing simple and easy-to-perform "pithead plays," singing anytime and anywhere. For example, the scaffolders in the first construction site of the Fifth Engineering Office were unwilling to move to the training class to live, missed their families, and were often late and left early. In response to this idea, the workers compiled a fast-rhythmic talk performance, "Why Don't You Move Here?" After watching it, the scaffolders reviewed and said: "This is a criticism of us!" After the play was performed, 95% of the workers moved in. So the performance team hurriedly wrote a drama, "Old Wang Moves into the Training Class," which greatly improved everyone's learning enthusiasm and eliminated phenomena such as tardiness and absenteeism. One tiler decided to postpone his wedding date and insisted on studying.

    III. Convening employee representative meetings and educating and driving the masses with the advanced ideas of advanced figures is an effective method in political work. The Fifth Engineering Office convened a employee representative meeting of advanced producers by means of a general election of representatives, which played a good role in promoting learning. After the advanced producer Yang Dezong opened the conference, he studied hard and got up at more than four o'clock every day. He said: "Whenever I think about studying politics and technology to welcome the large-scale construction in 1953, I can't sleep." His exemplary actions encouraged everyone, and as a result, the workers' learning enthusiasm in his construction site was greatly increased. Some even got up early on Sunday mornings to review, and some organized a week's worth of lessons and took them home to study with their school-age children.

    IV. Improving the living and welfare of winter training workers in the winter training class so that they can study happily and with peace of mind is an important issue. The winter training classes of the engineering offices have all focused on this work. The Changchun training class originally had no central kitchen, and everyone ate coarse grains. Some workers had poor digestion and had many opinions. Later, it was changed to refined grains, and a central kitchen was set up. The Second Engineering Office initially did not have tap water because it was in the suburbs, and the water used for cooking was from earth wells. There was sediment, and the workers could not eat it. The students' morale was low, and some started their own "small kitchens." Later, the political director personally took charge of improving the food. He studied the method of water leakage and filtration with the cooks to solve the problem of drinking water. The workers were moved and said: "The leaders take care of us meticulously. We have never had this at home. We eat snow-white rice. If we don't study hard, can we live up to the country's training!"

    V. The educational content of the winter training class should include both political education and technical education. Some comrades believe that technical education should be the main focus, which is inappropriate. Because construction workers have always been very scattered in the past, with high mobility and mixed composition, they have had few opportunities for political education. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to conduct a political education during the winter training period. The actual situation of this training class fully proves this point. (Editor's note: The winter training class of the engineering office also conducted cultural learning. Our opinion is: The winter training time is not long, and the content of political education and technical education is already a lot. If cultural learning is carried out again, it will inevitably further disperse the limited study time, which will make it difficult to learn well. Therefore, it is better to postpone cultural learning for the time being. If the workers urgently request to study, they can be explained.)

    VI. Teaching methods should pay attention to the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of teachers and workers. In the teaching for more than a month, some teachers were able to explain by combining the workers' thoughts and the examples of the workers, which was very effective and the workers were happy to listen. Some teachers only read from the textbook or only talk about abstract principles, which the workers could not accept and the effect was not great. Therefore, popularizing the textbook and combining it with real-life things is the key to the success or failure of education. When the winter training class was teaching the comparison between the new and old societies, the teacher interspersed the suffering history and exemplary deeds of the labor models Su Changyou and Xie Wanfu into the teaching materials to tell the students. When the teacher taught very vividly, many people cried out in the classroom. The co-worker Liu Junzhi was previously unwilling to be a construction worker. After listening to the story of Su Changyou, he wrote a note on the spot and reviewed, saying: "I am selfish, afraid of earning less money, and I don't like being a construction worker. After hearing the story of Su Changyou and Xie Wanfu, I am determined to learn from them and contribute to the country."

    In order to familiarize themselves with and grasp the facts familiar to the masses, the teachers of the winter training class went deep into the masses in advance, organized small forums, conducted individual interviews, and consulted with the team leaders to ask them to put forward opinions on the teaching material outlines. The teachers also absorbed workers to participate in the preparation of the courses. Everyone came to study the main requirements of each lesson, then grasped the center of the teaching materials, summarized the opinions of everyone, and then drafted detailed outlines, so that the teaching materials were combined with the actual situation of the masses. For example, the masses reflected a folk song circulating among construction workers: "Carpenters guard broken doors, bricklayers have no houses to live in, stonemasons die with no tombstones on their graves. The evils of the old society are endless." The teacher used this folk song as teaching material to tell the workers. After class, through discussion meetings and recollection meetings, it aroused everyone's hatred for the old society and their love for the new society, expressing their determination to learn their skills well.

    In addition, conducting auxiliary image education also has a good effect. When teaching about the great motherland, they visited museums and martyrs' halls. Some workers said: "In the past, I thought China was backward and poor. This time I understand that our motherland is truly great and has everything we need. We must work hard to build it."

    东北有色金属管理局工程公司的冬训工作
    李汀
    中央重工业部东北有色金属管理局工程公司，在去年十月间开始进行各种干部和工人的冬训筹备工作，十二月初普遍开始上课。经过一个多月来的学习，学员们由开始时的学习情绪不高而转为热情高涨，学员们的政治认识思想水平都有显著提高，普遍要求多学政治，个别的甚至申请入党。开学考试时，施工员班一百个人中没有一人答对“什么是共产党？”这个试题，但到第三次政治课结束考试时，全班成绩总平均达八十分以上。工人们的思想大大改变。现在他们的冬训工作仍在继续热烈地进行。东北有色金属管理局工程公司一个多月来的冬训工作，有如下几点经验：
    一、冬训开始时，进行充分的政治工作，贯彻从思想上发动工人群众的方针，稳定学员的情绪，是一个极重要的步骤。训练班开办的最初，很多人不愿参加学习，有的人想回家“猫冬”，他们说：“一年三季都在外边，结冻该回家了。”年纪大、文化低的人对学习没有信心。有的要请假回家，不准就“不辞而别”。第二工程处集中的一千二百人中走了三百多人，材料班就有十二个人偷偷的走了。学员在学习中表现厌腻，不起劲，在讨论会上不发言。训练班最初就以澄清思想提高学习热情作为中心工作。他们采用了组织“回忆会”的方式，在讲第一课“新旧社会生活对比”时，组织工人回忆旧社会的痛苦，这一阶级教育的方式激起了全体学员对旧社会的痛恨，对新社会的热爱，有力地稳定了他们不安心学习的情绪。第五工程处第一工地洋灰工人郭师傅回忆了他父亲被地主和官府逼得把十个脚趾剪掉的惨事后，当场在五百多同学面前表示：“一定好好学习，替父亲报仇，为人民效劳。”
    训练班又采用了大会教育与个别教育相结合的方式，组织干部下小组，以工人切身经历和生活体验来教育工人，向他们讲解学习和祖国建设的重大关系及其意义，发动并组织先进班队，向其他班队工人作报告，介绍自己的收获，来带动落后班组。为了说服那些较落后的学员，干部便下小组进行耐心的个别谈话。老工人瞿世先起初不愿学习，动员他学习时，他把眼睛瞪得挺大的说：“我不学习，干活累一年了，还叫我学习，我下决心回家歇歇，好喘一口气。”教员到宿舍去找他谈话，从现在生活条件唠起，唠扯到他的行李时说：“哦，双铺双盖呢！”老工友得意的补充说：“里、外三新呵！”从这勾起他的心事：他在成亲时连旧棉被都没盖上，现在生活竟这样幸福，他的内心起了激烈斗争。在另一次讨论会上他说：“现在我明白学习是为了啥，我要下决心好好学习，为祖国工作。”
    二、为安定学员学习情绪提高学习效率，训练班运用黑板报、电影、幻灯等各种武器，大力开展文娱活动。此外，健全生活制度，使生活正常化，也是一项重要工作。在文娱活动中训练班采取了“工人演工人”的方法，工人把自己周围所遇到和接触到的材料，加以整理和典型化，由工人自己演出，收效很大。第五工程处现在已经组织了十二个演出队，有二百七十人参加，创造和编写出快板、演唱、短剧等大小节目三十多个，内容主要是写新旧社会对比，也结合当前的学习，选择学习中的各种类型的典型人物来表现。工人们对这些作品感到很亲切，因而效果很好。如在学第二课时，各工地都演出了工人刘振武创作的话剧“我十年前的回忆”，对剧里主人孙福的遭遇，好多工人看了后，都痛哭流涕。广播员小张不能再看下去，伏在桌子上哭起来。正像老瓦工张恩喜说的：“这剧很感动人，在旧社会咱是学徒，根本就不顶人，挨打受骂学不到手艺呀！咱们过去跟他（指剧内人）都一样。”为了深入到车间发动群众，更迅速具体地反映和指导当前的工作，训练班又采用了演简单易行的“坑头戏”的方式，随时随地演唱。如第五工程处第一工地架子工都不愿搬到训练班住，恋家，早晚迟到早退。针对这一思想，工人们编了“你为啥不搬来呢？”的快板演唱，架子工看后检讨说：“这是对咱的批评！”这剧演出后，百分之九十五的工人都搬来了。于是演出队又抓紧编了一个话剧“老王搬住训练班”，这样使大家学习情绪大大提高，消灭了迟到溜号等现象。有一个瓦工决定把婚期推迟，坚持学习。
    三、召开职工代表会议，以先进人物的先进思想去教育和带动群众，是政治工作中的一个有效方式。第五工程处曾以普选代表的方法，召开了一次先进生产者的职工代表大会，对推动学习起了很好的作用。先进生产者杨德重开了大会后，奋发学习，每天四点多钟就起来，他说：“一想起学政治，学技术，迎接一九五三年大规模建设，就睡不着啦。”他的模范行动鼓舞了大家，结果他所在那个工地的工人们学习情绪大为高涨。有的星期日早晨还起早复习，有的把一星期的课整理好，带回家去和自己上学的儿女研究。
    四、冬季训练班中改善冬训工人的生活福利，使他们能愉快安心地学习，是个重要的问题。工程处冬训班各处都抓紧了这项工作。长春训练班原没有中灶，大伙吃粗粮，有些工人消化不好，意见很多，后改为细粮，并设有中灶。第二工程处起初因在郊区，没有自来水，作饭用土井水，有泥沙，工人不能吃，学员思想情绪低落，有的则自己搞“小伙房”。后来政治主任亲自负责把伙食搞好了，和炊事员研究了漏水滤过方法，解决了吃水问题，工人感动的说：“首长照顾咱们无微不至，在家也没这样啊，吃雪白的大米，咱再不好好学习，能对得起国家的培养吗！”
    五、冬季训练班教育内容应包括政治教育与技术教育两个方面，有的同志认为应以技术教育为主，这是不恰当的。因为建筑工人过去一向很分散，流动性大，成份很杂，受政治教育的机会很少，所以在冬训期间进行一次政治教育是完全必要的，这次训练班的实际情况充分说明了这一点。（编者按：工程处的冬训班还进行了文化学习，我们的意见是：冬训时间不长，政治教育和技术教育内容已很多，如再进行文化学习，势必使有限的学习时间更加分散，这样反而学不好，因此文化学习还是暂不进行为好。如果工人们迫切要求学习，可以对他们进行解释。）
    六、教学方法要注意理论与实际结合，教员与工人相结合。在一个多月来的教学中，有些教员能结合工人思想及工人中的事例讲解，收效很大，工人高兴听。有些教员只照课本念，或只讲些抽象的道理，工人接受不了，效果不大。所以，将课本通俗化与现实事物结合，是教育成败的关键。冬训班在讲新旧社会对比时，教员把劳动模范苏长有和谢万福两同志的受苦历史，以及模范事迹，穿插在教材里讲给学员，当教员很生动地讲授时，好多人在课堂里哭出声来。刘均志工友以前不愿当施工员，听了苏长有的故事后，他当场写条子检讨说：“我自私，怕挣钱少，不爱当施工员，听到苏长有和谢万福的故事，我下决心向他们学习，为国家出力。”
    冬训班的教员为了熟悉和掌握群众所熟悉的事实，事先都深入到群众中去，组织小型座谈会，个别访问，和队长组长商量，请他们对教材提纲提出意见。教员在准备课程时并吸收工人参加，大家来研究各课的主要要求，然后掌握教材中心，归纳大伙意见，再拟出细致的提纲，这样就使教材与群众实际结合了起来。例如群众反映了一首流传在建筑工人中的歌谣：“木匠守着破大门，瓦匠没房住，石匠死了墓上没碑坟，旧社会万般罪恶说不尽。”教员就把这首歌谣作为教材，讲给工人听。课后，通过讨论会，回忆会，更引起大伙对旧社会的仇恨，和对新社会的热爱，表示学好本领的决心。
    另外，进行辅助的形象教育，收效也很大，在讲授伟大祖国时，参观了博物馆、烈士馆，有的工人讲：“过去以为中国落后，中国穷，这回明白了我们祖国真正伟大，要啥有啥，我们可得使劲建设了。”
