The Teaching Reform of Tsinghua University
He Dongchang Lü Yingzhong

Since July 1952, Tsinghua University has been carrying out departmental adjustments under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Education. After the completion of the adjustment work, the school first established thirty majors (including eight majors in the Iron and Steel Institute) and fifteen specialized courses according to the needs of national industrial construction, in order to train various professional talents.

For Tsinghua University, this is a big change. In the past, Tsinghua's five departments lacked clear teaching goals, and the graduates were all "generalists" who could not meet the needs of national construction. Because after they arrived at the work site, they almost had to start from scratch. The fundamental reason for this phenomenon was that teaching was divorced from reality. For example, when factories were promoting and learning high-speed cutting methods, the school was still teaching "low-speed cutting" on belt lathes.

There were different views on the direction of the school's development. In the past, some people advocated that universities should cultivate "generalists," hoping to turn Tsinghua into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the California Institute of Technology in the United States; but according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, majors should be set up according to the needs of national economic construction, and various specialized talents should be trained. Obviously, the Soviet path is correct. In fact, the school is also doing it according to the Soviet experience.

According to the major settings, Tsinghua University has added the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing and the Department of Petroleum. In semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, the reactionary ruling class did not need to manufacture machinery, nor did they need to develop their own oil, they only relied on ordering from the United States and Britain. The reflection of this situation in the school was that there were no departments in these fields. Now, the task of national industrialization urgently requires institutions of higher learning to train a large number of talents in mechanical manufacturing, foundry and pressure processing, oil field drilling and production, oil refining, etc., in order to develop the motherland's machinery manufacturing and oil industry. In order to meet this requirement, Tsinghua University has added these majors.

In order to improve teaching quality and train young teachers, Tsinghua University established teaching research groups based on the experience of Soviet universities. Although this organization has only been established for two months, and there are still many problems due to lack of experience, it has indeed had considerable effects. Under the leadership of the teaching research group, most teachers can make relatively full preparations before lecturing, such as discussing and reviewing the lecture outline together, clarifying the key points of each lesson, studying how to explain difficult points, and pre-lecturing when necessary, etc. The teaching research group also paid attention to training and improving the teaching staff. For example, among the four teachers in the hydraulic structure teaching research group, three were newly assigned to lecture, and they jointly formulated teaching outlines, compiled lecture notes, prepared lesson plans, and conducted trial lectures under the leadership of the group. At the same time, thanks to the leadership of the teaching research group, the coordination between various teaching forms was resolved. Take experiments and lectures for example. In the past, the coordination was not good. Electrical Engineering was studied in the second academic year, while electrical experiments were conducted in the third academic year, so the teaching effect was very low. Now, this situation has been changed. When talking about transformers, experiments on various transformer connection methods are carried out, so that the theory learned by students in the classroom is proved by experiments.

In terms of teaching content, Tsinghua University has also carried out necessary reforms. After rapid Russian language learning, many teachers have the ability to translate Russian professional books. At the beginning of the semester, 120 teachers were organized to translate textbooks. Now "Hydraulics" and "Surveying" have been translated. According to the statistics of 104 courses, 60% of them adopted the Soviet teaching syllabus, of which 31 basically adopted Soviet textbooks, and 30 partially adopted Soviet textbooks. In the process of teaching using Soviet teaching syllabus and textbooks, teachers realized that each course should have its clear teaching purpose, so they generally explained the role of the course in the national economy in the introduction. This has improved the quality of teaching to a certain extent. For example, the general physics course used textbooks published 15 years ago, the content was outdated, and it lacked knowledge of modern physics. Now, this course has adopted the Soviet translation of physics textbooks, and teachers have begun to use advanced theories to explain problems in physics, such as using electronic theories to systematically explain electromagnetic phenomena.

Teaching reform resolved ideological disputes in individual departments. Teachers in the Department of Architecture had long-term disagreements on academic thoughts in the past, especially on the issue of accepting national heritage, their opinions were divided and they could not agree, and even caused disunity among teachers. In the ideological remolding study movement, although various erroneous ideas were initially criticized, the disputes were never resolved. In the teaching reform, with the help of Soviet expert Asefpukov, everyone had a common understanding of this issue, believing that China's national heritage should be accepted critically. At present, teachers are widely collecting information about ancient Chinese architecture and have begun to study relevant ancient architectural books, such as "Yingzao Fashi" and "Yingzao Zeli" etc. This is a new transformation in architectural teaching in our country.

Some problems have also occurred in the teaching reform of Tsinghua University. The main problem is that some comrades, regardless of objective conditions, have impatient emotions. Although they know that the level of students is low and uneven, the ideological and professional level of teachers needs to be further improved, and in terms of equipment, due to the large increase in students, it is even more insufficient and cannot meet the actual needs; however, they underestimated these situations ideologically and took some hasty measures, which caused chaos. In early December last year, some teachers worked almost 14 hours a day. They prepared teaching materials overnight, but because they were too unfamiliar with the new teaching materials, they sometimes still brought things they didn't understand to the classroom. And among the students, there was a phenomenon of excessive burden, especially the first-year students, because their level was low and they could not accept what the teachers taught, many students desperately rushed to do their homework, and their weekly study time often exceeded 60 hours. This affected the teaching effect and the health of the students. Because of insufficient equipment, the phenomenon of crowding is also very common. For example, the metal workshop only has 80 machines, but there are 2,800 people who want to practice. The school is trying to overcome these shortcomings and difficulties.

    清华大学的教学改革
    何东昌　吕应中
    自一九五二年七月起，清华大学在中央教育部领导下进行了院系调整。调整工作结束以后，学校首先根据国家工业建设的需要，设置了三十种专业（包括钢铁学院的八个专业）和十五种专修科，以培养各种专业人材。
    对于清华大学说来，这是一个很大的变化。过去，清华的五个系，都缺乏明确的教学目标，培养出来的都是“通才”，不能满足国家建设的需要。因为他们到现场以后，几乎都得从头学起。造成这种现象的根本原因是教学脱离实际。比如说，当工厂里正在推广、学习高速切削法的时候，学校里却还在教皮带车床的“低速切削”。
    在学校发展的方向上，曾经存在过不同的看法。过去有的人曾主张大学要培养“通才”，希望把清华办成美国麻省理工学院，或者是美国的加州理工学院；但根据苏联的先进经验，是按照国家经济建设的需要来设置专业，培养各种专门人材。显然地，苏联的道路是正确的。事实上，学校也是按照苏联的经验来做的。
    根据专业设置，清华大学增设了机械制造系和石油系。在半殖民地、半封建的旧中国，反动的统治阶级是不需要制造机械的，也不需要去开发自己的石油，他们只依靠向美国、英国的订货。这种状况在学校的反映，就是没有这方面的系科。现在，国家工业化的任务，迫切地要求高等学校大量地培养机械制造、铸工和压力加工、石油区钻采、石油炼制等等的人材，以发展祖国的机械制造和石油事业。适应这种要求，清华大学增设了这方面的专业。
    为了提高教学质量，培养年青的教师，清华大学根据苏联高等学校的经验，成立了教学研究组。虽然这种组织成立到现在还只有两个来月的光景，并且因为经验缺乏，也还存在着许多问题，但它的确已经有了相当大的效果。在教学研究组的领导下，一般教师多半能在讲课前进行比较充分的准备，例如共同讨论和审查讲课的大纲，弄清每一课的重点，研究如何讲解难点，必要时进行预讲等等。教学研究组还注意了培养和提高师资。例如水力结构教学研究组的四位教师中，有三位是新担任讲课的，他们便在组的领导下共同拟订教学大纲、编讲义、准备教案、试讲。同时，由于教学研究组的领导，解决了各种教学形式之间的配合问题。就拿实验和讲课来说吧，过去是配合得不好的，第二学年学电工学，而电工实验却是在第三学年进行的，所以教学效果很低。现在，这种情况已经改变，讲到变压器时，就作各种变压器连接法的实验，这样就使同学在课堂中学到的理论得到实验的证明。
    在教学内容方面，清华大学也进行了必要的改革。经过俄文速成学习，不少教师已有了翻译俄文专业书籍的能力。在开学时有一百二十位教师组织起来翻译教材。现在“水力学”、“测量学”已经译完。根据一百零四种课程的统计，采取苏联教学大纲的占百分之六十，其中有三十一种基本上采用了苏联教材，有三十种部分采用了苏联教材。在采用苏联教学大纲、教材进行教学的过程中，教师们认识了每门课程都应该有它的明确的教学目的，因而一般都在绪论中说明了本课程在国民经济中的作用。这就在一定程度上提高了教学质量。例如普通物理课，过去用的是十五年以前出版的教材，内容已经陈旧了，里面缺乏近代物理学的知识。现在，这门课已采用了苏联的物理学译本，教师开始用先进的理论来解释物理学中的问题，例如用电子学说来系统地说明电磁现象。
    教学改革解决了个别系里的思想论争。建筑系的教师过去在学术思想上长期存在着分歧意见，特别是在接受民族遗产这个问题上，意见纷纭，莫衷一是，甚至因此教师之间发生了不团结的现象。在思想改造的学习运动中，虽然初步批判了种种错误的思想，但论争始终没有得到解决。在教学改革中，经过苏联专家阿谢甫可夫的帮助，大家对这个问题有了共同的认识，认为应该批判地接受中国的民族遗产。目前，教师们正在广泛地搜集关于中国古代建筑的资料，并开始研究有关古代建筑的书籍，如
    “营造法式”、“营造则例”等等。这是我国建筑教学上的一个新转变。
    在清华大学的教学改革中，也曾经发生过一些问题。主要是有些同志不顾客观条件，存在着急躁情绪。他们虽然知道同学的水平是低的，而且参差不齐，教师的思想水平和业务水平也有待于进一步的提高，在设备方面，因同学的大量增加，更显得不足了，无法适应实际的需要；但在思想上对这些情况估计不足，采取了一些过急的措施，以致造成了忙乱现象。去年十二月初，有的教师每天工作时间几达十四小时，他们连夜准备教材，但因对新的教材过于生疏，以致有时仍然把自己都不大懂得的东西搬到课堂上去。而在同学中则形成了负担过重的现象，特别是一年级的同学，因程度低接受不了教师所教的东西，许多同学就拼命赶功课，每周的学习时间常超过六十小时。这样就影响了教学效果和同学的健康。因设备不够，拥挤的现象也很普遍，例如金工厂只有机器八十台，而要去实习的却有二千八百人。这些缺点和困难，学校正在设法克服中。
