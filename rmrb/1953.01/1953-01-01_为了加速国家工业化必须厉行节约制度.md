    To Accelerate National Industrialization, We Must Vigorously Implement a System of Thrift
    Sha Ying
    (I)
    Our nation's glorious task of industrialization has been placed on our work agenda. If we want to develop our industry and transform from an agricultural country into an industrial one, we must greatly expand our industrial base. We must not only use new technology and equipment as much as possible to transform old industries, but also establish many new industries, especially heavy industry and defense industry. Therefore, basic construction has been elevated to the primary position in the entire national work.
    Basic construction is the foundation for realizing national industrialization and must be carried out with the greatest strength.
    To carry out large-scale basic construction, we must not only have a large amount of equipment and talents who master this equipment, but also a huge amount of funds. The issue of funds is one of the important issues of industrialization.
    However, where do funds come from? In the past, the funds for capitalist countries to develop heavy industry "usually relied on the inflow of foreign capital, that is, by plundering colonies, obtaining reparations from the people of defeated countries, and borrowing foreign debts." [Note 1] Our people's democratic country cannot adopt these methods.
    Rely on international assistance? True, our great friend the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have helped us in every possible way; however, they are also carrying out huge construction projects, and we cannot demand too much from them, we cannot hinder their construction for the sake of our own construction. Therefore, the main source of our funds can only rely on the path of "self-saving for industry, the path of socialist accumulation," as pointed out by Stalin. Comrade Lenin has repeatedly pointed out that this is the only path for our country's industrialization." [Note 2] This path has been proven by the Soviet Union's experience over the past thirty years to be the most correct path.
    In the report to the 19th Congress of the CPSU, Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "The Soviet Union develops its national economy by relying on its own resources and the sources of its internal capital accumulation." Our country's experience in recent years has also proven that relying on our own resources and the internal accumulation of enterprises is the main source of funds for our industrial construction.
    The accumulation of funds must rely on increasing production and practicing thrift. The most important ways to increase production and practice thrift are: to give play to the initiative and creativity of employees, to learn and promote advanced experience, to organize patriotic emulation drives, to increase labor productivity; to pay attention to improving management and administration, to implement the economic accounting system, to fully utilize the effectiveness of equipment, to accelerate capital turnover, and to continuously reduce costs; as well as to reduce the consumption of raw materials, fuel, and electricity, to reduce various non-productive expenditures, and to improve product quality, etc. As long as we can make good use of these methods, we can increase infinite wealth for the country. Most of the wealth we increase through increasing production and practicing thrift is used for expanded reproduction and investment; a part is used to improve the material and cultural living standards of employees, which is completely in line with the long-term interests of the working class.
    We must also, through the national budget, accumulate and utilize the income of other national economic sectors as much as possible (such as urban taxes, agricultural taxes, and profits from state-owned commerce), and use people's savings to accumulate a portion of construction funds.
    However, these are only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, we should also use our funds properly, opposing waste. Stalin said: "However, the matter is not limited to and cannot be limited to accumulation alone. It is also necessary to be good at spending the accumulated reserves rationally and calculatingly, not to waste any of the people's financial resources, and to ensure that the accumulation is basically used to meet the important needs of our industrialization. Without these conditions, we will be in danger of wasting the accumulated financial resources." [Note 3] Therefore, we must take various measures to rationally use our accumulation, avoid waste, avoid dispersion, avoid squandering it on unnecessary uses, and avoid deviating from the basic line of our industrial construction. This means that we must correctly formulate the national construction plan in accordance with the development of industry and agriculture and the speed of capital accumulation; resolutely fight against various corruption and waste phenomena; establish a strict unified fiscal system and fiscal discipline; streamline the organization and staffing of government agencies, reduce all unnecessary expenditures; strive to increase labor productivity; and use economic accounting methods to achieve the purpose of thrift.
    (II)
    In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party, we have made achievements in implementing the thrift system. The movement to increase production and practice thrift launched in Northeast China in 1951 created wealth equivalent to 16 million tons of grain for the country. The mass movement to increase production and practice thrift carried out nationwide in 1952 (more than 80 percent of all employees participated in this movement in the first half of the year) achieved even greater results, creating more wealth for the country. In particular, the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements carried out fierce struggles against corruption, waste, and theft of state property, and established a moral atmosphere of cherishing state property, which is of great significance for us to carry out large-scale economic construction. However, we cannot deny that there are still many unsatisfactory phenomena in the work of various departments of our country, and there are serious shortcomings in exploring and correctly utilizing internal accumulation.
    First of all, there is serious waste in industrial and mining enterprises. In some factories and mines, advanced experiences have not been well promoted, labor productivity is not high, equipment utilization rates are too low, losses of raw materials and non-productive expenditures are large, a large amount of funds are tied up, product quality is poor, the plans for increasing production and practicing thrift have not been completed, and some have not even completed the state's production plan. For example, the scrap rate of Shenyang Machinery Plant No. 7 in May 1952 was 27.44 percent, and increased to 32.8 percent in June; Jinan Machinery Plant No. 2 assembled 46 machine tools in the movement to increase production and practice thrift, but only 8 of them met the standards; according to statistics from six workshops of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in the first half of 1952, steel worth 18 billion yuan was tied up due to poor quality; Taiyuan Tobacco Factory had nearly 20,000 boxes of products tied up due to poor product quality and could not be sold, and had to be sold at a loss in the end....
    Secondly, the waste phenomenon in basic construction is also alarming. Some basic construction departments, due to lack of careful planning, blindly start construction without correct exploration and design, and lack strong leadership in the construction process, unreasonable use of manpower and materials, often occur suspension of work waiting for drawings, waiting for materials, midway rework, waste of work, no one is responsible everywhere, poor engineering quality and other phenomena, so that the country's resources, manpower and financial resources form a huge waste. For example, 43 of the 50 dormitory partitions that had been built on a construction site in Heilongjiang collapsed in a gust of wind. Northeast Electric Engineering Plant No. 4 initially decided to build a factory in a certain city, so it built a dedicated railway line, built a warehouse, and transported a large amount of building materials, preparing to start construction; but later it was found that the city had experienced earthquakes in the past and was not suitable for building a factory, so the address was changed, wasting 2 billion yuan for nothing and affecting the construction period. Shandong Light Industry Machine Factory, before it was determined what kind of products to manufacture, ordered more than 200 new large-scale precision machines from abroad for 80 billion yuan, and bought more than 1,000 mu of factory land and prepaid a large amount of building materials for more than 8 billion yuan, but until December the production task was still not specifically decided, allowing a large number of machines to lie in the woods "sleeping", exposed to wind and rain, and the factory land was still a piece of sorghum field. These are certainly not the worst examples, the most heartbreaking is: we have built such useless fertilizer factories as Guangzhou, and opened the already excavated Dingxiang Iron Mine....
    In addition, in transportation, state-owned trade, state-owned farms and other aspects, there are also many waste phenomena. For example, the Central Trade Department ordered goods from abroad in 1951, mistakenly writing "3 tons" of medicine for the prevention and treatment of foot-and-mouth disease as "300 tons," resulting in an overpurchase of 297 tons and a waste of more than 4 billion yuan in tied-up funds; again, the department's translators mistranslated "brick tea" as "black brick tea," causing the country to lose another 2.2 billion yuan. The Shenyang area department store wholesale station, during the peak sales period in the winter of 1952, mistakenly tied up nine trainloads of wool sweaters worth 5.8 billion yuan (a total of 12,389 dozen) in the warehouse, while the masses could not buy wool sweaters to wear. This matter was only discovered recently, some of which were put into storage as early as June 19, and have been tied up for more than five months.
    There is no need to list more such examples. Stalin said: "Being good at rationally and calculatingly spending financial resources - this is the most important art." [Note 4] The above phenomena show that many of our comrades not only do not understand this art, but also have forgotten the thrift system, and even some leading departments and Party organizations have adopted an indifferent attitude towards these phenomena of poor management and waste of state property. This situation deserves our serious vigilance.
    The thrift system is an extremely important condition for creating internal accumulation of the economy and correctly utilizing accumulation, and is also an extremely important lever for us to further improve the national economy. The directives of the 19th Congress of the CPSU on the Soviet Union's development of the Fifth Five-Year Plan charged economic cadres in all positions of economic construction, large and small, to vigorously implement the thrift system and increase the profitability of enterprises. Comrade Malenkov said this in his report to the 19th Congress of the CPSU: "We should always pay attention to educating the Soviet people in the spirit of cherishing public and socialist property. It is necessary to eradicate all phenomena of waste of materials, manpower and financial resources, ... drastically reduce the miscellaneous expenses in industry, construction, transportation, agriculture, and trade, procurement and sales agencies; take firm steps to simplify the structure of state and economic agencies and reduce their administrative expenses; the financial department should strengthen the control over the completion of economic plans and the implementation of thrift through the ruble." Some of our comrades have forgotten these principles, so some intolerable waste phenomena have occurred. We should strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in implementing thrift.
    Although our financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved, and although we have done everything possible to accumulate a sum of funds for large-scale economic construction; however, if compared with the needs of our country's construction, it is still far from enough, and at the same time, we are currently carrying out the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Therefore, in order to realize the country's industrialization under the conditions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we must continue to work hard to accumulate funds and be good at using our funds carefully. Strictly implement the thrift system.
    (III)
    What should we do to quickly accumulate funds and rationally use funds?
    First of all, it is necessary to correctly formulate the national construction plan. Comrade Stalin said: Correctly and rationally formulating the industrial plan is one of the necessary conditions for properly utilizing accumulation. Without a plan or if the plan is incorrect, our construction will fall into a blind and passive state, and will inevitably waste a large amount of the country's manpower, financial resources and material resources, and delay the progress of national construction. Of course, our construction plan should be closely linked with the national economic situation, with our resources, the speed of accumulation and reserve forces. It is necessary to act according to our ability, and to give play to potential forces, not to be rash, nor to be conservative.
    Now our construction plan should put state-owned industry in the first place, ensuring its leading role, so as to drive the development of various economies. In state-owned industry, the decisive link is heavy industry. In heavy industry, it is also necessary to distinguish between major projects and minor projects, urgent projects and non-urgent projects, basic projects and auxiliary projects, in order to concentrate our limited funds and use them on key projects that are of great significance to the development of the national economy and are urgently needed. The method of starting everything at once, taking care of everything, not distinguishing between priorities, and dispersing the use of funds, the practice of not considering subjective forces, being greedy for more, and being fond of great achievements, especially the view of disregarding the overall situation and only taking care of one's own unit, will weaken the country's construction strength and delay the speed of national industrialization, and should be resolutely opposed. Of course, concentrating funds on heavy industry, especially ensuring the completion of major projects, must not be understood as other aspects can be ignored, if that is also wrong.
    Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the economic accounting of basic construction. Since basic construction is currently the department with the largest investment and the most spending, and it is also an extremely complex and arduous task, if the leadership is weak and the management is poor, and the country's investment cannot be used effectively and rationally, then it will be the place where funds are wasted the most. Therefore, we must strengthen the leadership of basic construction and strengthen the economic accounting of basic construction. We must carry out correct exploration and design before constructing any project, and then we can start construction. When designing a project, it must conform to the economic accounting system. To this end, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigation and research, based on the highest achievements in science, in accordance with advanced standards and quotas, to maximize the use of the country's resources, save as much as possible, and never waste a penny of the country's money. In the construction of the project, it is also necessary to calculate carefully, rationally use manpower and materials, establish various responsibility systems, use mechanical tools as much as possible, vigorously promote advanced experience, increase labor productivity, and reduce miscellaneous expenses, so that the project is done quickly, well, and economically. Only by strengthening the economic accounting system can our investment be used rationally and reduce waste. All wrong practices such as only seeking appearance and not seeking practical results, blindly expanding safety factors, and only seeking speed and disregarding quality must be criticized and corrected.
    In production work, we must use the existing industrial base and existing equipment, give full play to the potential forces contained, maximize the use of existing production capacity, improve production methods, reduce product costs, and strive to accumulate more funds for national industrialization.
    Thirdly, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses. Without the participation of millions of people, the implementation of thrift is empty talk. Experience has proven that mobilizing the initiative and creativity of the masses, "digging potential and finding tricks," is an unlimited source of increasing production and practicing thrift. As a result of the extensive discussion of the 1952 plan for increasing production and practicing thrift by mobilizing the masses, the Northeast region exceeded the original plan by 69.25 percent, and the North China region exceeded the original plan by more than 50 percent. Shenyang machinery system extensively mobilized the masses to find tricks, and found a total of 7,266 tricks, of which 156 can increase the production value by 36.6 billion yuan. We would be very wrong if we thought that some of the masses' opinions and tricks were small things and insignificant. The initiative of a worker, even if it can only save a brick or a wire, can accumulate into millions of money. Therefore, deeply mobilizing the masses is a necessary condition for implementing the thrift system. Stalin said: "To advance our industry, improve the productivity of industry, train new cadres for industrial construction, correctly carry out socialist accumulation, rationally use accumulation for the needs of industry, establish a strict thrift system, tighten the state organs, streamline them, clean up the bad habits and mud and dirt it has acquired during our construction period, and carry out a systematic struggle with those who steal and waste state property - all these tasks cannot be accomplished by any political party without the direct and systematic support of millions of the working class." [Note 5]
    Finally, it is necessary to conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism is a powerful weapon to expose and overcome the shortcomings of our work, and is a great driving force to promote the progress of our construction cause. Wherever criticism and self-criticism is conscientiously carried out, the work there will progress faster. The Shenyang Smelter once did a very poor job, but after being criticized by the Northeast Daily, the plant has now become an advanced factory. Therefore, in order to strictly implement the thrift system and protect the country's funds from being squandered, we should fully carry out criticism and self-criticism and wage unremitting struggles against bureaucracy, departmentalism, conservative thinking and all acts of wasting state property. We should attach great importance to criticism from below and mobilize the broad masses to supervise our construction work. All acts that stifle criticism and suppress criticism are serious evils, and these people should be given serious treatment. It is equally wrong to take an indifferent attitude towards the shortcomings and mistakes in our work. Liberalism is a breeding ground for shortcomings and mistakes and must be overcome. Only in this way can we guarantee the implementation and implementation of the thrift system and accelerate the country's industrialization.

    为了加速国家工业化必须厉行节约制度
    沙英
    （一）
    我们国家工业化的光荣任务，已经摆在我们的工作日程上了。我们要发展工业，由一个农业国变为一个工业国，必须大大扩大我们的工业基础。我们不仅要尽可能利用新的技术设备来改造旧的工业，而且要建立许多新的工业，特别是重工业和国防工业。因此，基本建设在整个国家工作中被提到首要地位。
    基本建设是实现国家工业化的基础，必须以最大的力量来进行。
    进行大规模的基本建设，不但要有大量的设备以及掌握这些设备的人材，而且还必须有巨额的资金。资金问题，是工业化的重要问题之一。
    但是，资金从何而来呢？从前资本主义国家发展重工业的资金，“通常是靠外方资金流入，即靠劫掠殖民地，靠从战败国人民方面取得赔款，靠借外债来进行的。”〔注一〕我们人民民主国家是不能采用这些办法的。
    依靠国际的援助吗？不错，我们伟大的朋友苏联以及各人民民主国家已经尽可能在各方面帮助我们；但是他们也正在进行巨大的建设，我们不能过分要求他们，我们不能为了自己建设而妨碍他们的建设。因此，我们资金的主要来源，只有依靠斯大林指出的：“为了工业而自己节约的道路，社会主义积累的道路，这条道路，列宁同志曾多次指出过，乃是我国工业化的唯一道路。”〔注二〕这条道路，已为苏联三十多年来的经验证明，是一条最正确的道路。
    在联共第十九次代表大会的报告中，马林科夫同志指出：“苏联是依靠自己的资源，依靠它内部资金积累的源泉来发展国民经济的。”我国几年来的经验也证明了，依靠自己的资源和企业内部的积累，是我国工业建设资金的主要来源。
    资金的积累，必须依靠增产节约。增产节约的办法最重要的是：发挥职工的积极性和创造性，学习和推广先进经验，组织爱国主义竞赛，提高劳动生产率；注意改善经营管理，实行经济核算制，充分运用设备的效能，加速资金周转，不断降低成本；以及减少原材料、燃力和电力的消耗，缩减各种非生产的开支，改进产品质量等等。只要我们能很好运用这些办法，便能为国家增加无限的财富。我们将这些由于增产节约而增加的财富，大部分是用于扩大再生产，用于投资；一部分用以提高职工的物质文化水平，这是完全符合于工人阶级的长远利益的。
    我们还必须经过国家预算，尽可能积聚和利用其他国民经济部门的收入（如城市的税收、农业税和国营商业利润等），以及利用人民的储蓄等来积聚一部分建设资金。
    但是，这些还只是事情的一方面。另一方面，我们还应当正当地利用我们的资金，反对浪费。斯大林说：“不过事情不限于也不能限于积累而已。还要善于合理地、有计算地支出积累起来的后备金，不要白白花掉人民财力的任何一文，要使积累基本上用于满足我国工业化的重要需要。没有这些条件，我们就要遭受浪费所积累的财力之危险”。〔注三〕因此，我们必须采取各种办法，合理使用我们的积累，避免浪费，避免分散，避免把它蹧蹋于不必要的用途，避免使它离开了我们工业建设的基本路线。这就是说，我们必须按照工农业的发展和资金积累的速度，正确地制定国家的建设计划；和各种贪污、浪费现象进行坚决的斗争；建立严格的财政统一制度和财政纪律；精简机关编制，减少一切不必要的开支；努力提高劳动生产率，以及用经济核算的办法达到节约的目的。
    （二）
    几年来，在党的正确领导下，我们执行节约制度是有成绩的。一九五一年在东北地区开展的增产节约运动，曾为国家创造了价值一千六百万吨粮食的财富。一九五二年在全国范围内开展的群众性的增产节约运动（在上半年参加这一运动的职工占全体职工的百分之八十以上），获得了更大的成绩，为国家创造了更多的财富。特别是在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动中，对贪污、浪费及盗窃国家财产的恶劣行为进行了猛烈的斗争，树立了爱护国家财产的道德风气，对我们进行大规模经济建设更具有伟大的意义。但是我们也不能否认，在我们国家各部门的工作中，还存在着许多难以令人满意的现象，在发掘和正确利用内部的积累上，存在着严重的缺点。
    首先，在工矿企业方面有严重的浪费。在某些厂矿中没有很好地推广先进经验，劳动生产率不高，采用过低的设备利用率，原材料的损失和非生产的开支很大，大量积压资金，产品质量低劣，没有完成增产节约计划，有的甚至没有完成国家的生产计划。例如，沈阳机械七厂一九五二年五月份废品率为百分之二十七点四四，六月份则增至百分之三十二点八；济南机械二厂在增产节约运动中，装配车床四十六部，合乎标准者只有八部；太原钢铁厂一九五二年上半年六个车间统计，即因质量低劣积压钢材价值一百八十亿元；太原烟草厂因产品低劣，积压近两万箱销不出去，最后不得不赔本出售……。
    其次，在基本建设方面的浪费现象也是惊人的。某些基本建设部门，由于缺乏周密的计划，未经正确的勘察、设计便盲目施工，以及在施工中缺乏强有力的领导，人力物力使用不合理，常常发生停工待图、待料，中途返工、废工，到处无人负责，工程质量低劣等等现象，使国家的资源、人力和财力形成巨大的浪费。如黑龙江某工地已砌好的五十栋宿舍间壁，大风一吹就倒了四十三栋。东北电工四厂最初确定在某城建厂，于是修起了专用铁路线，盖起仓库，运来了大批建筑材料，准备兴工；但后来发现该城过去曾发生过地震，不宜建厂，于是又改换地址，白白浪费了二十亿元，还影响了工期。山东轻工业机器厂，在制造何种产品还未确定之前，就以八百亿元向国外订购了二百多部新式大型精密的机器，又以八十余亿元买了一千多亩厂地和预付了大批建筑材料的费用，但直到十二月份生产任务仍未具体决定，让大批机器躺在树林子里“睡觉”，任风雨剥蚀，厂地还是一片高粱地。这些当然还不是最坏的例子，最令人痛心的是：我们曾建设过广州那样无用的肥料工厂，还开过已经挖空的定襄铁矿……。
    此外，在交通运输、国营贸易、国营农场等各方面，浪费现象也是不少的。例如中央贸易部一九五一年向国外订货，将防治口蹄疫药品“三吨”误写“三百吨”，结果多买了二百九十七吨，造成积压资金四十多亿元的浪费现象；再一次，该部翻译人员将“米茶砖”误译成“黑茶砖”，又使国家损失二十二亿元。沈阳地区百货批发站在一九五二年冬畅销期间，竟错将九火车价值五十八亿元的绒衣（总计一万二千三百八十九打）积压在仓库里，而群众却买不到绒衣穿，此事最近才被发觉，其中有的是在六月十九日就入库的，共积压了五个多月之久。
    这类例子不必再列举了。斯大林说：“善于合理地、有计算地支出财力——这是一件最重要的艺术”。〔注四〕上述现象是说明了：我们不少同志不仅不懂得这种艺术，而且他们已经忘记了节约制度，甚至有的领导部门和党的组织，对于这些经营不善和浪费国家财产的现象也采取了漠不关心的态度。这种情况是值得我们严重警惕的。
    节约制度是创造经济的内部积累和正确利用积累的极重要的条件，也是我们进一步提高国民经济的极重要的杠杆。联共第十九次代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示，责成一切大小经济建设岗位上的经济干部要厉行节约制度，提高企业的赢利。马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告中曾这样说：“我们应当经常注意以爱惜公共的、社会主义财产的精神教育苏联人民。必须根除一切浪费物资、人力和财力的现象，……大刀阔斧地减少工业、建筑业、运输业、农业方面以及贸易、采购和销售机关中的杂费；采取坚决的步骤来简化国家机关和经济机关的机构，并减少其行政费；财政部门应通过卢布来加强对完成经济计划和厉行节约的控制。”我们某些同志恰恰忘记了这些道理，所以发生一些令人难以容忍的浪费现象。我们应当努力学习苏联厉行节约的先进经验。
    虽然我们的财政经济状况已经根本好转，虽然我们已经尽一切可能为大规模经济建设积累了一笔资金；但是如果比起我们国家的建设需要来说，那仍然是很不够的，同时我们当前还在进行着抗美援朝的伟大斗争。因此，为了在抗美援朝的条件下实现国家的工业化，我们必须继续努力积累资金，并善于精打细算地使用我们的资金。严格执行节约制度。
    （三）
    为了迅速地积累资金和合理地使用资金，我们应该做些什么呢？
    首先，必须正确地制订国家建设计划。斯大林同志说：正确而合理地制订工业计划，乃是适当地利用积累的必要条件之一。如果没有计划或计划不正确，便会使我们的建设陷于盲目、被动的状态，必然浪费国家大量的人力、财力和物力，延缓国家建设的进程。当然，我们的建设计划要与国民经济情况，与我们的资源、积累速度及后备力量密切联系起来。既要量力而行，又要发挥潜在力量，不能冒进，也不能保守。
    现在我们的建设计划要把国营工业放在第一位，保证它的领导作用，以带动各种经济的发展。在国营工业中决定的环节是重工业。在重工业中，还要分别主要工程与次要工程，急需的工程与不急需的工程，基本工程与附属工程，以便集中我们有限的资金，使用到对发展国民经济有重要意义的和急需的重点工程上面去。那种百废俱兴、处处照顾、不分轻重缓急、分散使用资金的办法，那种不考虑主观力量、贪多冒进、好大喜功的作法，特别是那种不顾全局、只顾本位的观点，都会削弱国家的建设力量和延缓国家工业化的速度，都是应当坚决反对的。当然，集中资金使用于重工业，特别是保证其中主要工程的完成，决不能了解为其他方面就可以忽视了，如果那样也是错误的。
    其次，要加强基本建设的经济核算。基本建设既然是目前投资最大、花费最多的部门，同时又是一种异常复杂、异常繁重的工作，如果领导不力和管理不善，不能有效地、合理地使用国家的投资，那便将是浪费资金最大的地方。为此，我们要加强基本建设的领导，加强基本建设的经济核算。我们建设任何一个工程，都必须经过正确的勘察、设计，然后才能施工。在设计一个工程时，一定要合乎经济核算制。为此，必须深入调查研究，根据科学上的最高成就，按照先进的标准和定额，最大限度使用国家的资源，能省就省，绝不浪费国家的一分一文。在工程施工中，也要精打细算，合理地使用人力和物力，建立各种责任制，尽量使用机械工具，大力推广先进经验，提高劳动生产率，减少杂费，务使工程做到又快、又好、又省。只有加强经济核算制，才能使我们的投资合理地使用，减少浪费。一切只求外表不求实效，盲目扩大安全系数，只求速度不顾质量等等错误的作法，都要加以批判和纠正。
    在生产工作中，我们必须利用现有的工业基础和现有设备，充分发挥所蕴藏的潜在力量，最大限度地利用现有的生产能力，改善生产方法，降低产品成本，力求为国家工业化积累更多的资金。
    再其次，要深入发动群众。如果没有千百万群众的参加，厉行节约便是一句空话。经验证明，发动群众的积极性和创造性，“挖潜力、找窍门”，是增产节约无限的源泉。一九五二年的增产节约计划，由于发动群众广泛讨论的结果，东北区超过原计划总数百分之六十九点二五，华北区超过原计划百分之五十以上。沈阳机械系统广泛发动群众找窍门，共找出窍门七二六六件，其中有一五六件，即可提高产价三百六十六亿元。我们如果认为群众的某些意见和窍门是小事情，微不足道，那就大错了。一个工人的倡议，那怕只能节省一块砖或一根铁丝，却可以积成千百万计的金钱。因此，深入发动群众，是实行节约制度的必要条件。斯大林说：“向前推进我们的工业，提高工业的生产率，造就新的工业建设干部，正确地进行社会主义的积累，合理地使用积累于工业的需要，建立严格的节约制度，紧缩国家机关，使之精简，清洗掉它在我国建设时期所沾染的恶习和泥污，与偷盗及浪费国家资财的人做有系统的斗争——所有这些任务，没有工人阶级百万群众之直接的和有系统的支持，任何政党都不能胜任的。” 〔注五〕
    最后，要认真地开展批评与自我批评。批评与自我批评是揭发和克服我们工作缺点的有力武器，是推动我们建设事业前进的伟大动力。那里认真开展批评与自我批评，那里的工作便会进步得较快。沈阳冶炼厂曾经有一个时期工作做得很不好，但是经过东北日报的批评之后，现在该厂已变为一个先进的工厂了。因此，为了严格执行节约制度，保护国家的资金不被蹧蹋，我们应当充分开展批评与自我批评，向官僚主义、本位主义、保守思想及一切浪费国家财产的行为作不懈的斗争。我们应当十分重视自下而上的批评，要发动广大群众来监督我们的建设工作。凡是窒息批评、压制批评的行为，都是严重的恶行，对于这些人应当给以严肃的处理，凡是对我们工作中的缺点和错误采取漠不关心态度的人，同样也是非常错误的。自由主义是产生缺点和错误的温床，必须加以克服。只有这样，才能保证节约制度的执行和贯彻，才能加速国家的工业化。
