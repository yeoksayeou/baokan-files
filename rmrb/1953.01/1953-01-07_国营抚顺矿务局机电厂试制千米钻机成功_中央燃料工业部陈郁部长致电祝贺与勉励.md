The state-owned Fushun Mining Bureau Machinery Plant has successfully trial-manufactured a drilling rig capable of drilling to a depth of one thousand meters, making a great contribution to drilling work in future capital construction.

Before liberation, all drilling rigs used in China were imported from abroad. After liberation, thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the creative labor of the Chinese working class, many machinery plants have been able to manufacture drilling rigs for 300 meters and 500 meters. However, in order to fully utilize underground resources, some drilling work requires drilling to depths of over 1,000 meters. Without drilling rigs capable of drilling deeper, this goal cannot be achieved. Therefore, the successful trial-manufacture of a 1,000-meter drilling rig by the Fushun Mining Bureau Machinery Plant makes a significant contribution to the country's construction endeavors.

After the factory's employees successfully trial-manufactured the 1,000-meter drilling rig, they sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry on December 21, 1952, reporting their success, and pledging not to be arrogant or complacent, and to resolutely strive to overfulfill the 1953 national plan. Minister Chen Yu of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry sent a reply telegram congratulating them and instructing all employees to make persistent efforts and strive to manufacture even larger drilling rigs.

    国营抚顺矿务局机电厂试制千米钻机成功
    中央燃料工业部陈郁部长致电祝贺与勉励
    国营抚顺矿务局机电厂试制能够钻探一千公尺深的钻机成功，对今后基本建设中的钻探工作贡献极大。
    解放前我国所用钻机都是由国外进口，解放后，由于苏联专家的帮助和中国工人阶级创造性的劳动，不少机厂已能制造三百公尺、五百公尺的钻机。但是，为了充分利用地下资源，有些钻探工作需钻一千米以上，如果没有能够钻探较深的钻机，这一目的是达不到的。因此，抚顺矿务局机电厂试制千米钻机成功，对国家建设事业有重大的贡献。
    该厂职工试制千米钻机成功后，于一九五二年十二月二十一日打电报向毛主席和中央人民政府燃料工业部报捷，并保证不骄傲不自满，坚决为超额完成一九五三年国家计划而奋斗。中央人民政府燃料工业部陈郁部长特复电祝贺，并指示全体职工再接再厉，为制造更大的钻机而努力。  （中央燃料工业部通讯组）
