Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to TASS, peace fighters in Britain, Italy, and Canada are mobilizing the people to implement the resolutions of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress and strengthen the struggle to defend peace.

    The British Peace Committee has held an enlarged meeting in London, attended by 120 people, including 70 British representatives to the Vienna Congress. The meeting adopted a resolution outlining the resolutions of the Vienna Congress and defining the current tasks of peace-loving people in Britain. The resolution stated that the Vienna Congress pointed out that the most urgent task of the people of all countries is to promote a ceasefire in Korea and negotiations between the five major powers. The meeting also adopted another resolution condemning the British Labour Party's expulsion of members who participated in the Vienna Congress.
    Leaders of the Italian peace movement and some Italian representatives to the Vienna Congress held a meeting in Rome on the 17th. After extensive discussions, the meeting decided to intensify the peace movement while actively defending democratic freedoms, first and foremost the parliament's power to decide on matters of war and peace. The movement of Italian peace fighters to publicize the resolutions of the Vienna Congress among the Italian people has already begun. A mass rally to defend peace has been held in Rome, where Italian representatives who participated in the Vienna Congress delivered speeches. Donini said that although the government tried everything possible to prevent Italians from going to Austria, the Italian delegation to the Vienna Congress was the largest delegation. Member of Parliament Terrenova emphasized in his speech that the characteristic of the Vienna Congress was that the participants had complete freedom of speech. Liberal Party MP Nitti pointed out that every day, the cause of peace gains millions of new supporters. He emphasized that the idea of a peaceful settlement of the German question is becoming increasingly popular. The mass rally unanimously adopted a proposal put forward by Italian Senator and World Peace Council member Sereni, which condemned the US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and called on all Italians to oppose the government's attempt to implement an anti-democratic electoral system "reform," to rebuild a dictatorship in Italy in order to remove all obstacles and enable Italy to join military aggression groups. Mass rallies to discuss the resolutions of the Vienna Congress have also been held in other Italian cities such as Reggio nell'Emilia, Ferrara, and many cities in the province of Siena.
    The National Committee of the Canadian Peace Congress held a meeting in Ottawa on the 17th to discuss the achievements of the World People's Peace Congress and, on this basis, formulate a plan of action for the Canadian people to defend peace. About 50 representatives from all over the country attended the meeting. James Endicott pointed out in his report that at the World People's Peace Congress, the organized peace movement had established close ties with ordinary people who yearned for peace but did not belong to organized movements.

    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社讯：英国、意大利、加拿大的和平战士们正在动员人民贯彻执行维也纳世界人民和平大会的决议，加强保卫和平的斗争。
    英国和平委员会已在伦敦召开了扩大会议，参加会议的有一百二十人，其中七十人是英国出席维也纳大会的代表。会议通过决议，概述了维也纳大会的各项决议，并确定了英国爱好和平人士当前的任务。决议说：维也纳大会已指出各国人民当前最迫切的任务是促成朝鲜停火和五大国举行谈判。会议并通过另一个决议，谴责英国工党把参加维也纳大会的党员开除出党的行动。
    意大利和平运动的领袖和意大利参加维也纳大会的一些代表十七日在罗马举行会议。经过广泛讨论后，会议决定加紧进行和平运动，同时积极保卫民主自由，首先要保卫议会决定战争与和平问题的权力。意大利的和平战士们在意大利人民中间宣传维也纳大会决议的运动已经开始，罗马已举行过保卫和平的群众大会，参加维也纳大会的意大利代表在会上发表了演说。多尼尼说：虽然政府想尽一切办法阻止意大利人到奥地利去，但是出席维也纳大会的意大利代表团是最大的代表团。议员泰伦诺瓦在演说中强调维也纳大会的特点是与会者完全有言论自由。自由党议员尼蒂指出：每一天，和平事业都争取到数以百万计的新的拥护者。他强调说，和平解决德国问题的主张日益受到欢迎。群众大会一致通过意大利上院议员、世界和平理事会理事塞伦尼所提出的一项提案，这个提案谴责美国干涉他国内政的政策，并号召所有的意大利人反对政府的企图——企图实行反民主的选举制度“改革”，在意大利重建一个独裁政权，以便排除一切障碍，使意大利加入军事侵略集团。在意大利其他城市如勒佐·尼尔·艾米利亚、斐拉拉和西埃那省的许多城市，都举行了讨论维也纳大会决议的群众大会。
    加拿大和平大会全国委员会于十七日在渥太华举行会议，讨论世界人民和平大会的成就，并在这个基础上拟订加拿大人民保卫和平的活动计划。全国各地约有五十名代表参加了这次会议。文幼章在报告中指出：在世界人民和平大会上，有组织的和平运动已与热望和平但不属于有组织的运动的普通人民群众建立了密切联系。
