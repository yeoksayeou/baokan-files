How We Compile Winter Training Technical Education Plans and Technical Teaching Materials
Li Ping, Director of the Political Department, First Engineering Division, Construction Engineering Company, Central Ministry of Heavy Industry

Editor's Note: The quality of the technical education plan will determine the effectiveness of the winter training for basic construction workers. The following principles used by the First Engineering Division of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Construction Engineering Company and the Fushun Second Engineering Division in formulating technical education plans are correct: First, it is necessary to determine which types of workers to cultivate and train, and to what extent each type and level of worker should be trained. These general requirements are closely linked to the actual needs of the engineering plan and the development direction of the construction industry. Second, it is necessary to understand the workers' requirements for technical learning in order to make the plan practical and acceptable to the workers. Third, political education must not be relaxed during the technical education stage. Especially when teaching advanced experience, if the workers' conservative ideas are not broken, even if the workers learn advanced operating methods, they may not actually apply them after work begins. The experience of these two units can be used as a reference for winter training classes in various places.

Currently, basic construction worker winter training classes in various places are formulating technical education plans and compiling technical teaching materials in order to improve the technical level of workers through technical education and meet the needs of large-scale national economic construction. However, how to formulate good technical education plans and compile good technical teaching materials is indeed a difficult problem. We have some experience and some lessons in this regard.

Determine Leadership Intent

When formulating a plan, the leadership's thinking should first be clarified: what problems are you planning to solve through technical education, and what requirements are you aiming to achieve? When determining these general requirements, it is necessary to consider the needs of the engineering plan, as well as the requirements and conditions of the workers. For example, in order to solve the problem of occasional shortages of certain types of workers or idleness of others during construction, we proposed that workers in each type of work should learn two skills. For example, bricklayers should learn plastering, tiling, and pointing; steel workers should learn to install plumbing; and concrete workers should learn painting and glass installation. However, when doing this, we should not only see the current needs, but also the future development. For example, carpenters who install doors and windows should learn to support formwork, but those who can support formwork should not learn to make doors and windows. Because the manufacture of doors and windows will be mechanized and factory-produced, there is no need for a large number of carpenters to use handicraft production methods to manufacture doors and windows. We proposed that some types of workers should understand general basic principles, which is also determined according to the nature of the work and the technical level of the workers. For example, concrete workers should be given more explanations of basic principles, because if workers do not understand basic principles, they will not pay attention to project quality. We proposed that bricklayers should focus on practical operation, with the aim of developing a new set of operating procedures through operation demonstrations in order to solve the current problems of a small number of bricklayers and low quality.

Understand Mass Requirements

After clarifying the leadership's intent, it is also necessary to understand the requirements of the masses; otherwise, the plan will not be well implemented. When we initially formulated the plan, we stipulated that general basic principles, quality standards, and operating procedures should be explained, but after contacting the workers, we found that it did not fully meet their requirements. Because the technical level of the workers is different, they have different requirements. For example, first-level workers require drawing reading and material allocation; second-level workers require construction according to drawings; third-level workers and below require reading simple drawings and mastering operating skills; apprentices require shortcuts to become technicians immediately. Based on the workers' requirements, we revised the original plan, adding lectures on the meaning, purpose, and viewing methods of simple construction drawings, as well as simple technical principles, such as the properties, usage methods, preparation, and storage of materials. In terms of operation demonstrations, we divided them into large demonstrations and small demonstrations according to the nature of the work: bricklayers, bricklayers, plasterers, and pointing workers adopted large demonstrations, carpenters and steel workers adopted small demonstrations, and concrete workers could not demonstrate. This not only meets the leadership's intent but also satisfies the workers' requirements, truly achieving unity of purpose and thought from top to bottom. In terms of teaching methods, we adopted the "little teacher" system. In addition to general explanations, teachers also focused on cultivating first-level workers, so that first-level workers could become "little teachers." This not only solved the problem of insufficient teachers but also cultivated construction workers at the same time.

Combining Construction Management and Operating Procedures

In technical education, it is necessary not only to teach quality standards and operating procedures, but also to teach construction management, especially the team economic accounting system. But how to teach it well, so that workers can understand and do it, and it is easy to learn and easy to accept, is indeed a problem. When we first formulated the plan, in order to facilitate teaching management and not be limited by time, we compiled the technical security team system, team leader's daily report, team work plan, economic accounting, and other education in the first week, general basic principles and operating procedures in the second week, and advanced experience in the third and fourth weeks. However, when the workers saw the teaching plan for the first week, they raised many opinions. For example, some workers said when listening to lectures on economic accounting: "We don't learn accounting, so why are we still talking about economic accounting?" and were unwilling to listen. This shows that our plan formulation did not follow the mass line. Later, we interspersed construction management with other courses. For example, when talking about the advanced bricklaying method for bricklayers, we first talked about why to lay it this way (basic principle), how to lay it (operating procedure), and what the consequences would be if it were not laid this way (quality standard); when talking about advanced experience, we first talked about the need for the team to establish a team system, etc. In this way, it is not only easy for teachers to teach, but also easy for workers to accept.

Combining Theoretical Education and Practical Operation

In technical teaching, workers should both understand theory and be able to operate in practice. Therefore, the compilation of teaching materials must be practical. When we first compiled the teaching materials, the teachers prepared a lot of teaching materials, but because they were not compiled according to the workers' technical and cultural level, lecturing paint workers on "the nature of color" and concrete workers on "hydration," the workers could not accept them at all. Later, we asked the teachers to go deep into the workers' dormitories, take the teaching materials to solicit the workers' opinions, and re-compile them according to the leadership's intent, the workers' needs, and their ability to accept, which corrected this shortcoming. After the students understand the theory, they should also perform and operate, so that the workers actually master the technology. Especially when talking about advanced experience, it is best to ask advanced producers to speak and perform themselves, and then everyone can make suggestions and enrich the content, which will have a greater effect.

Combining Political Education and Technical Education

When starting technical education, the workers had some wrong ideas. For example, older skilled technicians were only willing to learn basic principles and drawings, and were unwilling to learn advanced experience. They thought: "Advanced experience is nothing, it's just a matter of being willing to work or not." Young workers were willing to take shortcuts and learn experience, but were unwilling to actually operate. If this kind of unrealistic and ambitious thinking is not corrected in time, it will hinder the workers' success in learning technology. Therefore, we believe that political and ideological leadership should also be strengthened during the technical education period; otherwise, the technical education plan will become a mere formality.

    我们怎样编制冬训技术教育计划和技术教材
    中央重工业部建设工程公司  第一工程处政治处主任  李萍
    编者按：技术教育计划订得好坏，将决定基本建设工人冬训工作的效果。中央重工业部建设工程公司第一工程处和抚顺第二工程处制订技术教育计划中的几个原则是正确的，即：一、要先确定培养、训练那些工种，对各个工种和各个等级的工人要求训练到什么程度。而这些总的要求，又都密切结合工程计划的实际需要和建筑业的发展方向。二、必须了解工人对技术学习的要求，以便使计划切合实际，工人乐于接受。三、在技术教育阶段中不能放松政治教育。特别是在教学先进经验时，如不打破工人的保守思想，即使工人学会了先进操作方法，在开工后也不一定就实际应用。这两个单位的经验可供各地冬训班参考。
    目前各地基本建设工人冬季训练班大都在制订技术教育计划和编制技术教材，以便通过技术教育提高工人的技术水平，满足国家大规模经济建设的需要。但如何订好技术教育计划、编好技术教材，确实是一个困难问题。在这方面，我们有些经验，也有些教训。
    确定领导意图
    制定计划，领导思想首先应该搞明确，究竟打算通过技术教育解决什么问题，达到什么要求。在确定这些总的要求时，必须根据工程计划的需要及工人的要求和条件。譬如为了解决施工中有时缺乏某一工种、有时有的工种又窝工的问题，我们提出每个工种的工人都要学会两种技术，如瓦工要学会抹灰、挂瓦、勾缝，钢筋工要学会安装水暖管道，混凝土工要学会油漆、安玻璃等。但这样做时，不要只看到现在的需要，也应看到将来的发展。如安装门窗的木工要学会支模型板，但会支模型板的就不要学制门窗。因为制门窗要实行机械化、工厂化，不需要大批木工采用手工业生产方式来制造门窗。我们提出有些工种工人要懂得一般的基本原理，也是根据工作性质和工人技术水平来决定的。如对混凝土工就要多讲解基本原理，因为工人不懂得基本原理，就不会重视工程质量。我们提出瓦工要着重实际操作，目的在于通过操作表演，制订出一套新的操作规程，以便解决目前瓦工数量少质量低的问题。
    了解群众要求
    领导意图搞明确以后，还要了解群众的要求，否则计划就不可能很好地实现。我们初步制订计划时，曾规定要讲解一般基本原理、质量标准和操作规程等，但当与工人接触后，发现与工人的要求不完全符合。因为工人的技术水平不同，有不同的要求。如一级工要求看图配料；二级工要求看图施工；三级工以下的要求看简单的图纸，熟练操作技术；徒工要求走近道，马上当技工。我们根据工人的要求修改了原来的计划，增加讲授简单的建筑图的意义、用途、视图法以及简单的技术原理，如材料的性质、使用方法、配制和保管等。在操作表演方面，我们根据工种的性质分成大表演和小表演：瓦工、砌砖、抹灰、勾缝工采取大表演，木工、钢筋工采取小表演，混凝土工可以不表演。这样既符合领导意图，又满足了工人的要求，真正做到了上下目的一致、思想一致。在教学方法方面，我们采取了小先生制。教员除作一般的讲解外，并有重点地培养一级工，叫一级工能当小先生。这样不但解决了教员不足的问题，而且同时培养了施工员。
    施工管理和操作规程相结合
    在技术教育中，不仅要讲授质量标准和操作规程，而且要讲授施工管理，特别是小组经济核算制。但如何讲得好，使工人能懂会做，容易学又容易接受，确实是一个问题。我们在第一次制订计划时，为了教学管理的方便和时间不受限制，曾把技术保安小组制度、组长日报、班组作业计划、经济核算等教育编制在第一周，一般基本原理、操作规程编在第二周，先进经验编在第三、四周。但当工人看到第一周教学计划时，提出了很多意见。如有的工人听讲经济核算时说：“我们也不学会计，怎么还讲经济核算呢？”就不愿意听。这说明我们制订计划没有走群众路线。后来我们把施工管理与其他课程穿插着讲，如讲瓦工先进砌砖法时，先讲为什么要这样砌（基本原理），怎样砌（操作规程），如不这样砌后果怎样（质量标准）；在讲先进经验时，先讲小组要建立小组制度等。这样，不但教员容易讲，工人也容易接受。
    理论教育与实际操作相结合
    在技术教学中，应该使工人既懂得理论又会实际操作。因此，编制教材就必须切合实际。我们在开始编制教材时，教员准备了很多教材，但是由于没有根据工人技术、文化水平来编制，给油漆工讲
    “色的性质”，给混凝土工讲“水化作用”，工人根本接受不了。后来我们要教员深入工人宿舍，拿着教材征求工人意见，根据领导意图、工人需要和接受能力重新编制，才改正了这一缺点。当学员懂得理论后，还要进行表演、操作，使工人实际掌握技术。特别是讲先进经验时，最好叫先进生产者自己讲，自己表演，然后大家提意见，充实内容，效果会更大。
    政治教育与技术教育相结合
    开始进行技术教育时，工人们有一些错误思想，如老年的熟练技工只愿意学习基本原理和图纸，不愿意学习先进经验。他们认为：“先进经验没有啥，就是肯干不肯干的问题。”青年工人愿意走近道，愿意学经验，但是不愿意实际操作。这种脱离实际的、好高鹜远的思想，如不及时扭转，就会妨碍工人学习技术的成效。因此我们认为，在技术教育时期还要加强政治思想领导，否则技术教育计划就会流于形式。
