    The bellicose American Professional Soldier - Eisenhower
    Dwight Eisenhower, who was officially inaugurated as President of the United States on the 20th, is a bellicose professional soldier promoted by American monopolists. His government is a government directly controlled by Wall Street bosses.
    Eisenhower is a typical example of someone who rose to prominence by being loyal to American monopolists and engaging in military speculation. In his early years, Eisenhower was considered mediocre, and his only notable achievement was on the football field. He tried dozens of different professions, but achieved nothing. Finally, he decided to pursue a military adventure career and entered West Point Military Academy, the stronghold of reactionary American soldiers, in 1911. Eisenhower once said that there are only two professions in the world that have more enthusiasts than practitioners: the military and prostitution. He chose one of them. However, Eisenhower had no military talent. In military school, he was only known for beating black people. After graduating, he was assigned to the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, but he showed a unique talent for scheming. In 1927, he was selected to participate in a mission to Western Europe under the guise of the "American War Memorials Commission" to engage in espionage activities, initially showing enthusiasm for the overseas expansion of American monopoly capital. Later, he chose his path, and during the Great Depression of 1929-1933 in the United States, he drafted a "Research Report and Implementation Plan on Industrial Mobilization and the Supply Sources of Necessary War Materials" for Wall Street and American warlords, offering a suggestion to solve the economic crisis with war.
    Because of his obsequiousness, in the mid-1930s, he won the appreciation of MacArthur, then Chief of Staff. When MacArthur went to the Philippines as the head of the U.S. military delegation to strengthen the bloody rule of American imperialism there, he took Eisenhower with him to help plan and organize the suppression of the people's movements in the Philippines and other parts of Asia. After returning home, he exerted great efforts in the U.S. military exercises in 1941, and thus won the appreciation of Marshall, then Chief of Staff, and was promoted to general. In 1942, he was sent to England. There, he was greatly appreciated by the veteran British warmonger Churchill. Later, he served successively as the commander of the U.S. forces in the European theater and the commander-in-chief of the "Allied Forces," but he proved to be a completely incompetent "general" in the North African and Western European campaigns. However, he faithfully implemented the poisonous plan to delay the opening of the second battlefield, preserve West Germany and the German monopoly enterprises that had close relations with American monopoly capital, and destroy the industry and cities in the East German regions that were on the verge of liberation, and was therefore particularly appreciated by the American ruling group. Under the praise of the propaganda machine of monopoly capital, this "Ugly Ike" from Abilene became a "hero" of American monopolists.
    In 1945, after Eisenhower returned to China, he succeeded Marshall as Chief of Staff. After he climbed to the peak of his military career, he planned to carry out even greater military adventures to ensure the excess profits of American monopolists. He vigorously advocated maintaining a "strong" army, opposed large-scale arms reductions, and emphasized the establishment of a large air force and the implementation of universal military training to prepare for launching a third world war. He thirstily said that the U.S. armed forces should be built into "the most powerful machine of destruction in the world."
    Eisenhower's war proposals were deeply appreciated by his Wall Street masters. The Wall Street tycoons decided to bring him into the White House. As a first step, American monopolists had him resign as Chief of Staff in 1948, sending this professional soldier, who had been in the military for more than 30 years, to Columbia University to be the president, so that he could obtain the status of a "civilian" in preparation for running for president. Behind the scenes, this matter was arranged by Watson, the chairman of International Business Machines Corporation of the Morgan Group, Allen, a member of the Rockefeller Group, and Emmanuel, who had close relations with both the Rockefeller Group and the Cleveland Group. Although Eisenhower held the position of president of an ordinary university, he used this identity to vigorously promote war. His first speech to Columbia University students called them "soldiers" and demanded their "blood, sacrifice, and death." In this year, he published a memoir entitled "Crusade in Europe," in which he expressed deep regret that he had not been able to get close to the Balkans near the Soviet Union, saying, "The name of almost every small country in Eastern Europe reminds us of unfulfilled goals."
    Because of his blatant anti-Soviet views, after the establishment of the North Atlantic Aggression Group, he was recalled to the White House and appointed as the commander-in-chief of the aggression group's army. After returning home from a visit to Europe, he vigorously promoted the U.S. imperialist global arms expansion and war preparation plan in the country. In speeches to members of Congress, he tirelessly proved the necessity and benefits of this plan. He emphasized that promoting the cause of U.S. imperialism "requires guns and people," and "if the United States can only provide guns and ask others to use these guns to do the necessary work, then I am very satisfied." Soon after, in a secret testimony to a joint meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, Eisenhower also showed that he was a warmonger who was good at atomic blackmail. When talking about the atomic bomb, he said ferociously: "If I think it is in my interest, I will use it immediately."
    By last year, the things that American monopolists had arranged for his coming to power were ready, and Eisenhower resigned from the position of commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Group army and returned to the United States to participate in the presidential election. The so-called "eight major financial groups" in the United States, especially the Morgan Group, the Rockefeller Group, and the DuPont Group, which advocated the most vigorous foreign expansion, gave strong support to this intended person. The American big bosses spared no expense to spend tens of millions of dollars, mobilized 90% of the American newspapers, and even personally came forward to arrange for Eisenhower. On the list of his backers, there are many important figures from the American "Sixty Families," in addition to Watson, Emmanuel, Allen, and others, there are also Aldrich, the former chairman of Chase Bank of the Rockefeller Group and Little Rockefeller's brother-in-law, Whitney, a major shareholder of Mobil Oil Company, Parkinson, the general manager of Equitable Life Insurance Company; Reed, the chairman of General Electric Company of the Morgan Group, John Collier, the general manager of Goodyear Tire Company and director of Morgan Silver Company, and Dreaper, a shareholder of Dillon-Reed Company; Sloan, the chairman of General Motors Company and director of DuPont Company of the DuPont Group, Wilson, the general manager of General Motors Company, and Carpenter, the former deputy general manager of Remington Arms Company; Drake, the chairman of Gulf Oil Company of the Mellon Group and director of Mellon National Bank and Trust Company; D'Olier, a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company of the Kuhn-Loeb Group; Armour, the big boss of Armour Company of the Chicago Group; Senator Saltonstall and Lodge, the political representatives of the Boston banking group; automobile magnate Henry Ford; Pew, the big boss of Sun Oil Company; Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family; Weir, the chairman of National Steel Corporation; Hutchison, the vice president of Chrysler Corporation, and Sellebach, who represents the interests of Bank of America, etc. Eisenhower's widespread support from monopolists shows that he is a loyal agent of American monopolists.
    Eisenhower did not disappoint the grace of cultivation of the Wall Street bosses. After being elected, he invited the leading figures of the most aggressive big capital groups to personally take charge of the government's military and political power. Dulles, a key figure in the Rockefeller Group and a famous warmonger who once clamored that "the atomic bomb is a much more benevolent weapon," was appointed Secretary of State. Wilson, a big member of the DuPont Group, a death merchant, and the general manager of General Motors Company, who profited the most from war and war preparation, was appointed Secretary of Defense. Humphrey, the chairman of Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company, known for his "conservative views" by the Cleveland Consortium (he has close ties with both the Mellon Group and the Rockefeller Group), was appointed Secretary of the Treasury. Nelson Rockefeller of the Rockefeller family also personally served as the chairman of the Special Committee, "representing the President in formulating and studying the organizational work of various executive departments of the government." From the appointment of these people, it is not difficult to see that the Eisenhower government represents the broad interests of the American monopoly capital group, it is not difficult to smell the gunpowder smell of the Eisenhower government, and it is not difficult to foresee that its policies will be opposed by the American people and the people of the world.

    好战的美国职业军人——艾森豪威尔
    二十日正式就任美国总统的德怀特·艾森豪威尔是美国垄断资本家一手提拔起来的一名好战的职业军人。他的政府是华尔街老板直接掌权的政府。
    艾森豪威尔是一个标准地靠着效忠于美国垄断资本家和从事军事投机而发迹的人。在早年，艾森豪威尔被认为是一个庸碌的人，他的唯一显身手的地方是足球场。他曾经尝试过几十种不同的职业，但一事无成。最后他决定从事军事冒险生涯，在一九一一年投入美国反动军人的堡垒西点军校。艾森豪威尔曾经说，世界上只有两种职业，爱好的人比从事的人为多，就是：军事和卖淫。他选择了其中之
    一。但艾森豪威尔在军事上并没有什么才能。在军事学校中，他只是以好殴打黑人出名。毕业以后，他被派在美国陆军中任少尉，在钻营方面却表现出有独到之处。一九二七年，他被选中参加在“美国战争纪念物委员会”名义掩护下到西欧从事间谍活动的使团，初步表现出对美国垄断资本海外扩张事业的热心。以后他就选定了他的道路，在一九二九—一九三三年美国经济大恐慌期间，他给华尔街及美国军阀草拟了一个“关于工业动员及开辟战争必要原料的供应来源的研究报告及实施计划”，作了
    一个用战争解救经济危机的献策。
    由于他善于奉迎，在三十年代中期，他博得了当时任参谋总长的麦克阿瑟的赏识，当麦克阿瑟以美国军事代表团团长的资格赴菲律宾加强美帝国主义在那里的血腥统治的时候，就带着他跟随左右，协助策划和布置镇压菲律宾和亚洲其他地区的人民运动。回国以后，他在一九四一年美国军事大演习中大卖气力，因此又得到了当时的参谋总长马歇尔的赏识，被提升为将军。一九四二年他被派到英国。在那里，他很得到英国老牌战争贩子邱吉尔的赏识。后来他先后任欧洲区美军司令，“盟军”总司令，但是在北非和西欧战役中证明是一个完全不称职的“将才”。但他忠诚地执行了延期开辟第二战场，保存西德与美国垄断资本有密切关系的德国垄断企业，以及炸毁濒于解放的东德地区的工业和城市的毒辣计划，因而特别受到美国统治集团的赏识。在垄断资本的宣传机器的捧场之下，这位阿比兰的“丑艾克”从此变成了美国垄断资本家的“英雄”。
    一九四五年，艾森豪威尔回国后，继马歇尔任参谋总长。在他爬上了军职的高峰后，他就计划进行更大的军事冒险来保证美国垄断资本家的超额利润。他竭力主张保持“强大的”陆军，反对大量削减军备，并强调主张建立庞大的空军和实施普遍军训，以准备发动第三次大战。他曾渴血地说要把美国武装部队建设成为“世界上最有威力的制造毁灭的机器”。
    艾森豪威尔的战争主张深得华尔街主子的欢心。华尔街的大亨们决定把他捧进白宫。作为第一个步骤，美国垄断资本家在一九四八年叫他辞去了参谋总长职，把这个在军队里混了三十多年的职业军人送到哥伦比亚大学去当校长，使他能取得“文官”的身份，以准备作总统候选人。在幕后安排这件事情的就是摩根集团的国际商用机器公司董事长华生，洛克菲勒集团要员艾伦，以及与洛克菲勒集团、克利夫兰集团均有密切关系的爱曼努尔等人。艾森豪威尔虽然担任的是普通大学的校长职务，却利用这个身份大事鼓吹战争。他对哥伦比亚大学生的第一次讲话就把他们称呼为：“士兵们”，并要求他们的“血、牺牲和死”。就在这一年，他发表了一本题为“欧洲十字军”的回忆录，在这本书里，他对自己当年未能取得贴近苏联的巴尔干深表遗憾，他说：“差不多东欧每一个小国的名字，都使我们想起未曾达到的目的。”
    由于他的露骨的反苏观点，在北大西洋侵略集团
    一成立后，他又被召回白宫被委作这个侵略集团军
        队的总司令。他在到欧洲考察了一趟回国后，就在
            国内为美帝国主义的全球扩军备战计划竭力鼓吹。
            在对国会议员的演说中，他絮絮不休地证明这种计
        划的必要和好处。他强调，推行美帝国主义的事
        业，“就需要枪和人”，而“如果美国能够只出枪，而要别人拿这支枪来做必要的工作，那我是十分
    满意的。不久之后，在一次向参议院外交和军事两
    委员会的联席会议秘密作证中，艾森豪威尔并且表
    明自己是一个善于进行原子讹诈的战争贩子。他在
    谈到原子弹时狰狞地说：“如果我认为对我有利，
    我将立即使用它。”
    到了去年，美国垄断资本家为他的上台所安排的事情都就绪了，艾森豪威尔就辞去北大西洋集团军队总司令的职务，回美国参加总统竞选。美国所谓
    “八大财团”，特别是主张向外扩张最力的摩根集团、洛克菲勒集团及制造军火的杜邦集团，都对这个意中人给予大力支持。美国大老板不惜花费成千万的美元，动员了美国百分之九十的报纸，甚至亲
    自出马，为艾森豪威尔布置。在他的撑腰人的名单
    上，有着美国“六十家族”的许多重要人物的名字，除了华生，爱曼努尔，艾伦等人以外，还有洛克菲勒集团的大通银行当时的董事长、小洛克菲勒的小舅阿尔德里奇，美孚石油公司大股东惠特尼，公平人寿保险公司总经理帕金逊；摩根集团的奇异电气公司董事长李德、固特立轮胎公司总经理兼摩根银公司董事约翰·柯立尔，狄隆—瑞德公司股东德莱柏；杜邦集团的通用汽车公司董事长兼杜邦公司董事斯隆，通用汽车公司总经理威尔逊，前莱明顿军火公司副总经理卡本特尔；梅隆集团的海湾石油公司董事长兼梅隆国民银行及信托公司董事德雷克；库恩—洛伯集团的宾夕法尼亚铁路公司的董事德奥里尔；芝加哥集团的阿摩尔公司大老板阿摩尔；波士顿银行团的政治代表参议员沙顿斯脱尔和洛奇；汽车大王亨利·福特；太阳石油公司大老板普由；范德比尔特家族的范德比尔特；国民钢铁公司董事长威尔；克莱斯勒公司副总经理赫琴逊以及代表美利坚银行利益的色勒巴赫等等。艾森豪威尔得到垄断资本家的广泛支持，说明他是美国垄断资本家的忠实的代理人。
    艾森豪威尔的确没有辜负华尔街老板们栽培的恩典，他在当选后，就双手邀请最富侵略性的大资本集团的首要人物亲自执掌政府军政大权。洛克菲勒集团的要角、曾经叫嚣“原子弹是仁慈得多的武器”的著名战争贩子杜勒斯出任国务卿。死亡贩子杜邦集团的大员、在战争和备战中获利最多的通用汽车公司的总经理威尔逊出任国防部长。克利夫兰财团以“保守观点”闻名的匹兹堡固本煤炭公司董事长汉弗莱（他与梅隆集团、洛克菲勒集团均有密切关系），出任财政部长。洛克菲勒家族的纳尔逊·洛克菲勒还亲自出任特别委员会的主席，“代表总统拟订和研究政府各执行部门的组织工作”。从这些人的任命，就不难看出艾森豪威尔政府是代表了美国垄断资本集团的广泛的利益，就不难嗅出艾森豪威尔政府的火药气味，也就不难预见它的推行的政策必将遭到美国人民和世界人民的反对。
