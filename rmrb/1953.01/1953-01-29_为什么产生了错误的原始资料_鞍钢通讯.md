	Why Were Erroneous Original Materials Produced
	——Anshan Steel Communication
	An Gang
	"Without correct original data, there is no correct design." This is one of the important lessons learned in the basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. How can we obtain correct original data? The most important thing is: those who collect the original data must value this work, which determines the fate of the design work, with a spirit of infinite loyalty to the country and the people, and must deal with the original data with a scientific work attitude and work methods. At the same time, attention should be paid to the quality of the original data and its authenticity and completeness.
	In the first half of 1952, the design department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company produced and provided quite a lot of inaccurate or even completely erroneous original data when collecting original design data from abroad, causing certain losses to the work.
	There are many reasons for the errors, one of the important reasons being that some comrades who collected the original data had subjective ideas and work styles.
	Some technicians blindly believe in old drawings made by Japanese or Germans, and even think: "Can't other people's drawings be reliable?" What is the fact? In March 1952, the design department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company provided a complete set of factory building construction drawings of a certain factory to the Soviet design agency that helped us with the design. This was a drawing drawn by the Germans a long time ago. The designers blindly believed in the old drawings and did not actually check them on site. They thought, "Anyway, it won't be too different," and prepared to send it to foreign design units. Before the data was sent out, the Soviet experts looked at it and found that a plan view of the entire factory was completely inconsistent with the actual situation. On this drawing, a vacant lot was drawn on the east side, but it was actually a factory building; the repair shop on the east side of the factory building was drawn on the west side. Seeing this situation, the Soviet experts made a strict and well-intentioned criticism, saying: "This kind of irresponsible data will bring serious losses to the country. If the design is carried out according to this drawing, it will inevitably have to be completely reworked in the future, and the original planned date of factory construction will be greatly delayed." There are many lessons to be learned from blindly believing in old drawings and not doing actual checks, and this is just one example.
	Some people have the worst kind of analogy, the logic of which is: "If A is like this, then B must also be like this, without exception." Therefore, as long as there is data on A, then the materials for B, C, and D can be inferred in this way. When collecting original materials for large-scale rolling steel, the designers saw an old drawing of a heating furnace and assumed that another heating furnace was "roughly the same." In fact, there were many differences. Even more serious was when measuring the column foundation of the heating furnace. They looked at a row of house column foundations near the side of the furnace, only surveyed one of them, and concluded that the size and shape of the house column foundation next to the furnace and the column foundation outside the furnace were exactly the same. After the drawing was made and handed over to the Soviet experts, the Soviet experts looked at it strangely, because from the side view, the foot of the house column foundation just extended into the furnace body of the heating furnace. So the Soviet experts dug away the soil next to the foundation and observed on the spot, and found that there were no "three" rows of house column foundations at all, but only rectangular column foundations connected together. If the design is carried out according to the original drawing, the project will suffer the most serious losses. The error of this analogy method lies not only in replacing the whole with individual facts, but also in observing this fact in isolation from other facts, rather than observing it in connection with various related things. At that time, the person in charge of measuring the pillars only considered the pillars, but did not consider them in connection with the heating furnace, so naturally he could not come to the correct conclusion.
	Some people are too lazy to climb up and down to collect original data, and are particularly uninterested in collecting original data on existing equipment, thinking: "Anyway, the equipment is there, it is useless to collect or not collect original data." But they forgot that if the basic construction work accommodates their "interests," then the country and the people will have to pay a huge price for their "interests." For example, once when collecting the original data of a steel structure factory building, it was necessary to measure the size of the steel windows of the factory building. The comrades who collected the data looked at it roughly from a distance and saw that a row of shelves was very neat, so they estimated that the size of the steel windows on this side was roughly the same, so they marked "same size" on the original data. When the Soviet experts carried out the design, they went to the factory to conduct on-site investigation and took a ruler to measure on the spot, and found that the size was not "same." Then they asked our designers to measure in detail, which proved that the "estimated conclusion" did not match the facts. This matter seems to be a small matter. The Soviet experts pointed out:
	"The data you provide is inconsistent with the actual situation. If you design according to this wrong data, you will have to change the design during construction and cause rework. The designed wall skin skeleton cannot be well connected with the steel window. The wall skin skeleton designed smaller must be processed and enlarged, and the one designed larger must be reduced. In this way, the entire newly made structure will be destroyed, and the engineering quality and the integrity and beauty of the new building will be greatly damaged."
	Some people like to rely on their old experience. In his opinion, the naked eye and measuring instruments are at least equal, so he relies on "estimation" instead of calculation, and relies on "observation" instead of on-site measurement. This style is quite common and the most harmful.
	Now let's take the example of a chimney. When our designer was making the original data of the height of the heating furnace chimney of a certain factory, he did not go to the site to measure it, but took a look and thought: "It's probably around forty meters, almost!" So he wrote "chimney forty meters" on the original data. After reading this data, the Soviet experts believed that the forty-meter chimney could not be used, and consulted with the company to decide to dismantle it and build a new sixty-meter chimney on the spot. They made a design and started digging the flue, preparing to dismantle it. One day, the Soviet experts were worried, so they ran to the heating furnace chimney to measure it on the spot, and found that it was originally a sixty-meter chimney that could be used immediately.
	What is the most basic lesson in all these lessons? That is: we must attach importance to the work of collecting original data. The work of collecting original data is scientific work, not an unimportant "technical" work; people engaged in this work must have a scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, and do not believe in any materials that have not been obtained through scientific methods. Do not believe your own eyes, let alone the materials that existed in the old China, nor believe your own narrow experience.
	At the same time, those who collect original data must not be afraid of any difficulties. No matter how high in the sky or underground, no matter how bad the conditions are, they should go deep into the site and conduct on-site investigations. What is particularly worth noting here is that many of our major projects are designed in the Soviet Union, and Soviet comrades cannot actually observe everything. Only when we provide completely correct information can we get completely correct designs.
	Leading cadres of basic construction units must strengthen political leadership over the work of collecting original data, and constantly fight against various subjective ideas. The design department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company once compiled some typical examples of subjectivism and carried out universal education among the staff, which proved to be quite effective. Leading cadres of basic construction units should also pay attention to solving the common ideological problems among designers, such as some designers thinking: "It doesn't make much sense to measure something that already exists," thinking that "old drawings can be used reluctantly"; some people think that there is no relationship between the error in the original data, "It is not too late to modify it when it is discovered during construction in the future." All these ideas should be criticized in a timely manner by using concrete examples. In addition, every technician should be consciously abandoned backward working methods and master scientific working methods that meet the needs of large-scale construction. For example, when measuring land, there is a habit of stepping in rural areas to build houses, but this method must not be applied to the design work of large-scale construction projects. There are some people who also confidently step "accurately". They can go to the site to measure the land without a ruler. This kind of situation must be corrected in a timely manner.
	The design management department must not "easily believe" in various original data submitted for review, but must "doubt boldly" and conduct inspections from various aspects. The design department must conscientiously implement strict management systems, and pay special attention to strengthening the review of original data, and must check out all unreliable data before it is used for design or sent abroad.

    为什么产生了错误的原始资料
    ——鞍钢通讯
    安岗
    “没有正确的原始资料，就没有正确的设计”，这是鞍山钢铁公司基本建设中的重要经验教训之一。怎样才能得到正确的原始资料呢？最重要的是：搜集原始资料的人必须以对国家、对人民无限忠诚的精神来重视这个决定设计工作命运的工作，必须以科学的工作态度和工作方法来处理原始资料，同时要注意原始资料的质量和它的真实性、完整性。
    一九五二年上半年，鞍钢设计部门搜集国外设计的原始资料时，曾经产生了并提供了相当多的不准确的甚至完全错误的原始资料，给工作造成了一定的损失。
    造成错误的原因很多，其中重要的原因之一，是有些搜集原始资料的同志存在着主观主义的思想和作风。
    有些技术人员盲目相信日本人或德国人制作的旧图纸，甚至认为：“人家的图纸还不可靠？”事实是怎样呢？一九五二年三月鞍钢设计部门曾经向帮助我们进行设计的苏联设计机关提供了一份某厂的全套厂房建筑图，这是一份很久以前德国人画的图纸。设计人员盲目相信旧图纸，根本没有拿到现场实际核对。他们认为：“反正差不了多少”，便准备送到国外设计单位去。苏联专家在资料送出前看了一下，发现其中一张全厂平面图完全与实际情况不符合。在这张图上，东面画有一块空地，实际上却是厂房；厂房东面的修理厂却被画在西面。苏联专家看到这种情形，便提出严格的善意的批评说：“这种不负责任的资料是要给国家带来严重损失的。如果按照这个图纸进行设计，将来势必全部返工，原订的建厂日期就要被大大地推迟。”盲目相信旧图纸、不作实际查对的教训是很多的，这不过是其中的一个例子。
    有的人有一种最坏的类比法，其逻辑是：“甲如此，乙也必然如此，不能例外。”因此，只要有了甲的资料，那么，乙、丙、丁的材料便可依此类推了。在搜集大型轧钢的原始材料时，设计人员看到一个加热炉的旧图便推想另外一个加热炉“大体不差”。实际上却是差别颇多。更严重的是测量加热炉的柱基础时，他们看了靠近炉子旁侧的一列房柱基础，仅测绘了其中的一个，便断定紧接炉旁的房柱基础大小、形状和炉外的柱基础完全一样。制作成图交苏联专家后，苏联专家看着有些奇怪，因为这样从侧面图上看，房柱基础的脚正好伸到加热炉的炉体中来了。于是苏联专家便挖去基础旁的泥土，实地观察，发现原来并没有什么“三”列房柱基础，而只是联结在一起的带长方形的柱基础。如果按照原图进行设计，就会使工程受到最严重的损失。这种类比方法的错误，在于不仅用个别的事实代替总体，还把这个事实同其他事实孤立起来观察，而不是和各种有关的事物联系起来观察。当时负责测量柱子的人只考虑柱子，而没有把加热炉联在一起加以考虑，这样就自然不能得出正确的结论了。
    有的人嫌搞原始资料爬上爬下太麻烦，特别是对现有设备原始资料的搜集不感兴趣，认为：“反正设备就在那里，搞不搞原始资料没有什么用处。”可是他们忘记了，如果基本建设工作迁就了他们的“兴趣”，那么，国家和人民就要为他的“兴趣”支付出巨大的代价。譬如有一次在搜集一个钢铁结构厂房的原始资料时，需要把该厂厂房的钢窗的尺寸加以测定，搜集资料的同志竟粗枝大叶地从远处望了望，看见一排架子十分整齐，便估计在这一个侧面上钢窗的尺寸大体上差不多，于是在原始资料上标明“尺寸一样”。苏联专家进行设计时到厂里实地调查，拿了尺子到厂房实地去量，发现尺寸并不“一样”，便再提请我国设计人员详细测量，证明那个“估计出来的结论”的确不符事实。这件事看起来似乎是件细小的事情，苏联专家指出：
    “你提供的资料同实际不符合，如果按照这个错误资料设计了，那就要在施工中改变设计，造成返工。设计好的墙皮骨架不能很好地和钢窗吻接起来，设计小了的墙皮骨架就要加工改大，设计大了的就要改小。这样，就破坏了整个新制的结构，同时也将大大地损害了工程质量和新建筑物的完整和美观。”
    有的人喜欢靠自己的老经验办事。在他看来，肉眼与测量器至少是不相上下，因而遇事便靠“估计”而不靠计算，靠“观察”而不靠实地测量。这种作风相当普遍，为害也最大。
    现在让我们举一个烟筒的例子吧。我们的某设计人员在作某厂加热炉烟筒高度的原始资料时，他不去实地测量，拿眼一看便认为：“大概四十公尺上下，差不多！”于是在原始资料上写成“烟筒四十公尺”。苏联专家看了这个资料，认为四十公尺的烟筒无法利用，商同公司方面决定拆掉并在原地新建一个六十公尺的烟筒。他们作了设计并开始挖烟道，准备拆掉。有一天，苏联专家不放心，跑到加热炉烟筒跟前实地测量，结果发现原来这正是一根立刻可以利用的六十公尺的烟筒。
    所有这些教训中最基本的教训是什么呢？这就是：必须重视搜集原始资料这一工作。搜集原始资料的工作是科学的工作，而不是一个无关紧要的“技术”工作；从事这种工作的人必须要有科学的求实精神，不要相信一切不是经过科学方法而得到的材料，不要相信自己的眼睛，更不要相信旧中国时代已有的材料，也不要相信自己那一点点狭隘的经验。
    同时搜集原始资料的人，要不怕任何困难，不论高空、地下，条件如何恶劣，都应深入现场，实地考察。在这里，特别值得注意的是，我们有不少大工程是在苏联设计的，苏联同志不可能对各种事情都作实际观察。只有我们提供了完全正确的资料，我们才有可能得到完全正确的设计。
    基本建设单位的领导干部必须加强对搜集原始资料工作的政治领导，经常不断地同各式各样的主观主义思想作斗争。鞍钢设计部门曾经把一些主观主义的典型事例汇编起来在工作人员中普遍进行教育，这个办法颇有成效。基本建设单位领导干部还应该注意解决设计人员中带有普遍性的思想问题，如有些设计人员认为：“已经有了的东西再去量一下没有多大意思”，认为“旧图可以将就使用”；有的人认为原始资料差错一点没有关系，“有差错，将来施工时发现了再改不晚”。对于这些思想，都应该及时利用具体事例加以批判。另外，还应该使每一个技术人员自觉地抛弃落后的工作方法，掌握适应大规模建设需要的科学的工作方法。譬如量地，在农村盖房子有步量的习惯，但这种方法绝不能应用在大规模建筑工程设计工作上。有一些人，他们也自信步量“准确”，到现场量地可以不带尺子，对这类情况，必须及时加以纠正。
    设计管理部门对交审的各种原始资料，绝不能“轻易置信”，而是要“大胆怀疑”，多方面进行检查。设计部门必须认真贯彻严格的管理制度，特别要注意加强原始资料的审核工作，务必将所有不可靠的资料在用作设计之前或送到国外之前都检查出来。
