    Designs Against Waste
    Editor's Note: The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government published the "Heavy Industry Newsletter." The recently published second issue of this journal featured an editorial entitled "Designs Against Waste," listing the errors in the design work of the Northeast First Ceramic Factory and the resulting enormous waste, illustrating the serious significance of design work in the nation's capital construction endeavors. The faulty design of the Northeast First Ceramic Factory is a matter of the past and has already been investigated and addressed. However, the case of the Northeast First Ceramic Factory is by no means unique. Currently, such erroneous and wasteful designs are common in design work in various regions and departments. Therefore, we are publishing a summary of this editorial, hoping that all design departments will examine their work and strive to improve the quality of design work.

    Design work is an important link in the capital construction endeavor. After the state correctly formulates a capital construction plan or decides to build a certain project, whether this plan can be reasonably realized depends primarily on the design work. The quality of design work determines the future development of industry. When carrying out capital construction, we must pay attention to this crucial work.

    At present, not all of our cadres and technical personnel have understood the serious significance of design work and the correct design principles. There are many "wasteful designs" in our state-owned enterprises playing a leading role in some important projects. The design of the Northeast First Ceramic Factory is one such typical example of error. With the help of Soviet experts, we have many excellent design examples in our overall capital construction, both technically and economically. However, the leaders and designers of the First Ceramic Factory did not study these excellent examples, did not think to learn from their experiences, but instead were self-righteous and engaged in wasteful designs.

    The construction of any major project should go through a project assignment and preliminary design phase, proposing its construction direction, scale, and the technical conditions to be adopted. However, the designers of the First Ceramic Factory even considered such overall designs unimportant. They neither considered various different options for comparison, nor repeatedly studied how to determine a reasonable overall design from different perspectives, but rather pieced together the various buildings of the entire factory in a disorganized manner, resulting in some serious problems in the overall design. For example, under the condition of building only one tunnel kiln per year, they designed and built a large factory building capable of accommodating four tunnel kilns, resulting in a long-term idle construction area. The design also did not include finished product warehouses and packaging rooms, resulting in a situation of mutual incompatibility. For example, placing a molding workshop in the opposite direction of material transportation created difficulties in the production process; civil engineering and mechanical designs were not linked to each other, and the raw material storage库 was more than one meter higher than the crane track of the grinding workshop, making it impossible for the batching crane of the grinding workshop to enter the storage库, resulting in unreasonable two-stage transportation.

    Design workers should be disseminators of advanced ideas and advanced technical achievements. That is to say, design workers should have a keen sense of advanced ideas and advanced technical achievements in industrial construction and apply new scientific achievements in their designs as much as possible. However, the designers of the First Ceramic Factory adopted an unacceptable attitude of disregard for advanced technology. For example, they did not conduct soil permissible compressive strength analysis tests for the design of important factory buildings, but simply proceeded from assumptions; they did not determine the technical specifications for building materials, but arbitrarily increased their safety factors, so the pillars of the factory buildings, according to experts' estimates, could be used for five centuries; the circular crushing yard did not adopt a one-row arrangement, but was designed as a "circular clock type," which inevitably complicated the transmission system and made the transportation method unreasonable; instead of adopting a design scheme that arranges the main factory buildings and auxiliary buildings according to the production process, the various buildings were placed arbitrarily, which inevitably made it impossible to carry out assembly line operations and increased unnecessary transportation during the production process.

    Design workers should seriously consider their design schemes from an economic point of view. That is to say, design workers should consider how to carry out reasonable designs from the perspective of national economic accounting. However, the designers of the First Ceramic Factory did not have this economic accounting point of view, but proceeded from their own personal interests. In addition to the design examples mentioned above, they also designed the entrances of the main factory buildings and laboratories into polygonal shapes, which not only reduced the effective utilization area of the building area, but also wasted materials and labor, increasing construction costs.

    Design workers should, in the overall design, seriously consider the operating conditions of the workers and ensure the conditions for the health of the workers as much as possible. However, the designers of the First Ceramic Factory did not break away from the influence of bourgeois ideology in their design and did not seriously consider the operating conditions and health conditions of the workers within the scope of possibility. For example, the equipment in the circular crushing yard was crowded, hindering the operation of the workers; the workers' hospital was designed to be built in front of the dusty and noisy main factory buildings; the gas generator was built near the main workshop, affecting the health of the workers. Was it due to regional or other conditions that it was impossible to change this unreasonable situation in the design, and the workers' hospital and gas generator could only be built in such an unreasonable place? Obviously not, because the First Ceramic Factory was built in a new area, and there were no unfavorable conditions preventing it from making reasonable arrangements.

    Of course, the incorrect designs that we have already discovered, including the design of the First Ceramic Factory, were not intentionally caused by the designers subjectively. In most cases, it is because we have not seriously conducted ideological education among design technicians, have not ideologically criticized bourgeois viewpoints, have not systematically put forward the principles that should be followed in design, and have not promptly presented the advanced design examples made with the help of Soviet experts for everyone to learn from. Therefore, our leading cadres are responsible for some of the mistakes made in the past in design.

    In order to accept these experiences and lessons and improve design quality, on the one hand, it is necessary to organize cadres and technical personnel to learn from advanced design examples. On the other hand, it is necessary to carry out opposition to the narrow and partial economic viewpoints and conservative technical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie in the design departments. Without getting rid of these ideological influences, our design institutions will not be able to correctly complete the tasks assigned to them by the state.

### 反对浪费的设计

    反对浪费的设计
    编者按：中央人民政府重工业部出版了“重工业通讯”。最近出版的该刊第二期以“反对浪费的设计”为题发表社论，列举东北第一陶瓷厂建厂设计工作的错误，以及由此造成的巨大浪费的事实，说明设计工作在国家基本建设事业中的严重意义。东北第一陶瓷厂的错误设计是过去较久的事情，而且已经作了检查、处理，但是东北第一陶瓷厂的事例绝不是唯一的。目前在各个地方各个部门的设计工作中，这种错误的浪费的设计是普遍的。因此我们把这篇社论摘要发表，希望各个设计部门对自己的工作加以检查，为改进设计工作的质量而努力。
    设计工作是基本建设事业中的一个重要环节。国家正确地制定了基本建设计划，或决定了兴建某一项工程之后，能否合理地实现这个计划，首先取决于设计工作。设计工作的质量决定着将来工业的发展情况。在我们进行基本建设时，必须注意这一项关系重大的工作。
    目前，我们的干部与技术人员并不是都已了解了设计工作的这一严重意义和正确的设计原则。我们国营企业中，正有许多“浪费的设计”在一些重要工程中起着主导的作用。东北第一陶瓷厂的设计正是这样的错误的典型之一。在苏联专家帮助之下，我们的整个基本建设中有许多在技术上与经济上都极卓越的设计范例。然而第一陶瓷厂的领导者与设计人员，却不研究这些卓越的范例，没有想去吸取这些范例的经验，只是在那里自以为是地进行着浪费的设计。
    任何一个比较重大的工程的建设，都应该经过计划任务书和初步设计，提出它的建设方针、规模、应采取的技术条件等。然而第一陶瓷厂的设计人员甚至对于这种总体设计也都认为是不重要的。他们既没有设想各种不同的方案加以比较，又不从各个不同的角度去反复研究如何确定一个合理的总体设计，而只是凌乱地拼凑整个工厂的各个建筑物，因而就在整个设计中发生了一些严重的毛病。例如，在每年只修建一座隧道窑的条件下，却设计修建了容纳四座隧道窑的大厂房，致使建筑面积长期闲置。在设计中又未包括成品仓库与包装房间，因而形成了互不配合的状况。又如将一个成型厂房放在了输送料的相反方向，形成了生产过程的困难；土木建筑与机械的设计互不联系，原料贮藏库比粉磨厂房的吊车轨道高出了一公尺以上，致使粉磨厂房配料吊车无法进入贮藏库，结果造成不合理的两段运输。
    设计工作者应该是先进思想与先进技术成就的传播者。也就是说，设计工作者应该对于工业建设中的先进思想与先进的技术成就有敏锐的感觉，在自己的设计中尽可能地运用新的科学成就。但是第一陶瓷厂的设计者对于先进技术采取了不能容许的漠视态度。例如他们对于重要厂房的设计，根本不做土壤许可耐压力的分析试验，而只是随意从假定出发；对于建筑材料不做技术规格的确定，而随意加大其安全系数，因而厂房的支柱据专家的估计可用五个世纪；圆形粉碎场不采取一列式的，反而设计为“圆形时钟式”，这就必然造成传动系统的复杂化和输送方式的不合理；不采取按生产过程排列各个主要厂房与附属建筑的设计方案，而是随意摆置各个建筑物，这就必然无法进行流水作业，增加生产过程中不必要的运输。
    设计工作者应该严肃地从经济上考虑自己的设计方案。也就是说，设计工作者应该从国家经济核算的观点上去考虑如何进行合理的设计。然而第一陶瓷厂的设计人员没有这种经济核算的观点，而从自己的个人兴趣出发。除了上面所举的设计的例子而外，他们还把主要厂房及试验室入口设计成多角形的，结果不仅使建筑面积的有效利用面积缩小，而且多费材料和人工，提高了建筑成本。
    设计工作者应该在整体设计中，尽可能地严肃地考虑到职工的操作条件并保证职工健康的条件。但是第一陶瓷厂的设计人员在设计中没有摆脱资产阶级的思想影响，没有在可能范围内严肃地考虑到职工群众的操作条件与健康条件。例如圆形粉碎场的设备拥挤，妨碍着工人的操作；工人医院设计建筑在尘土飞扬、异常嘈杂的主要厂房之前；煤气发生炉建筑在主要作业厂房的近侧，影响工人的健康。是否由于地区或其他条件的限制，在设计中无法改变这种不合理的情况，只能把工人医院、煤气发生炉建筑在这样不合理的地方呢？显然不是的，因为第一陶瓷厂是建筑在一个新的地区，并没有妨碍它做合理布置的不利条件。
    当然，我们已经发现的那些不正确的设计，包括第一陶瓷厂的设计在内，并不是设计人员主观上有意造成的。其中绝大多数情况是由于我们还没有认真地在设计技术人员中进行思想教育，没有在思想上批判资产阶级的观点，没有系统地提出在设计中应该遵循的原则，没有及时地把在苏联专家帮助之下所做成的先进的设计范例提出来给大家学习，因此过去在设计中所犯的一些错误，我们领导干部是负有责任的。
    为了接受这些经验教训、提高设计质量，一方面需要组织干部与技术人员向先进的设计范例进行学习。另一方面必须在设计部门中，进行反对资产阶级狭隘的局部的经济观点和保守的技术观点。不解脱这些思想上的影响，我们的设计机构将不可能正确地完成国家所给予它的任务。
