    Qinghai's "Tibetan Newspaper" Warmly Welcomed by Tibetan People

    Since its inception two years ago, Qinghai Province's "Tibetan Newspaper" has been warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people of Qinghai Province. When the "Tibetan Newspaper" is delivered to the remote grasslands, Tibetan herders often run out of their tents, cheering, "Chairman Mao's newspaper is here!" Living Buddhas, Lamas, and farmers and herders have all established reading groups. In Tibetan-populated areas and many monasteries in Qinghai, more than 300 reading groups have now been established, with more than 9,500 reading group members. Last year, the "Tibetan Newspaper" received 150 submissions and letters from Tibetan people in various regions. The publication of the "Tibetan Newspaper" has strengthened the connection between the People's Government and the Tibetan monks and laypeople.

    In 1952, the circulation of the "Tibetan Newspaper" more than doubled compared to 1951, and it was changed from a ten-day publication to a weekly publication starting from the thirty-fourth issue. January 16th of this year was the second anniversary of the "Tibetan Newspaper," and Tibetan people in Xining City gathered to express their congratulations.
