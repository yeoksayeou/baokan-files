Sun Zhanyuan and Yi Caixue
By Shifeng, Xinhua News Agency Reporter

During the Battle of Shangganling, countless heroic figures emerged from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Their high degree of self-sacrifice and resourceful fighting style vividly demonstrated the noble qualities of the people's soldiers' boundless loyalty to the motherland and the cause of peace, as well as their contempt for the enemy and their overwhelming heroic spirit. Sun Zhanyuan, a member of the Chinese Communist Party and a platoon leader of a shock platoon, and Yi Caixue, a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and a demolition man, were such figures.

On the first day of the battle, the American aggressor army launched fourteen fierce attacks on Hill 597.9 to the right of Shangganling, north of Jinhua, in the morning with four battalions of troops, but all were heroically repelled by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. In the afternoon, after the soldiers took the initiative to switch to tunnel warfare, a battalion of the enemy climbed onto the field fortifications of our army's forward platoon and built a series of open-air firepower bunkers with steel plates, wood, and sacks. The enemy's light and heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, 60mm mortars, and recoilless guns fired wildly from these bunkers, tightly sealing off our army's counterattack routes.

This forward position was built by our soldiers with their own blood and sweat, and it was the position they had defended with their lives for the past year. Now that the enemy's hooves had trampled on this position, how could the soldiers allow the enemy to stay? They hid in the tunnels, waiting angrily for the order to counterattack, ready to retake it at any moment. Communist Party member Sun Zhanyuan was designated as the platoon leader of the shock troops for the counterattack, and the heroic and resourceful soldier Yi Caixue was the first demolition man in the shock squad. All preparations for the attack were completed, and the soldiers of the shock platoon stood quietly at the tunnel entrance, watching the enemy intently.

As it gradually grew dark, the counterattack artillery fire went straight at the enemy, and most of the enemy's fortifications were destroyed. Sun Zhanyuan led the soldiers of the shock platoon out of the tunnel and charged straight at the enemy with irresistible force. When they approached the enemy's bunker only 100 meters away, the remaining four bunkers fired dense firepower from sixteen machine guns, and the shock platoon's charge was frustrated. At this time, Sun Zhanyuan sent someone to contact the counterattack troops in the tunnel, and ordered Yi Caixue to advance towards the enemy's first firing point.

Yi Caixue immediately braved the enemy's firepower, jumped over the shell craters and crisscrossing trenches, and nimbly reached the enemy's first firing point, successfully destroying it. But at this time, Yi Caixue was exposed to the enemy, and the enemy in the second firing point began to shoot at him wildly.

Yi Caixue tried several times to rush out of the shell crater, but the dense machine-gun bullets prevented him from raising his head. At this moment, he suddenly heard the voice of Platoon Leader Sun Zhanyuan coming from the left: "Go up from the right, I'll cover you!" Then, Sun Zhanyuan's machine gun fired fiercely, and the firepower in the enemy's second firing point was immediately drawn to the left. Yi Caixue stood up and hurriedly ran up from the right, but the enemy fired flares again, and the position was as bright as day. Yi Caixue's movements were discovered by the enemy again. The machine gun in the third bunker also suddenly opened fire, and Yi Caixue immediately lay on the loose soil churned up by the shells, trying to keep his body as low as possible as he crawled forward, avoiding the bullets fired by the enemy. The path he crawled over became a furrowed ditch. Bullets flew over his head in row after row, or shot into the loose soil beside him. His head and face were covered with dust kicked up by the bullets, and his eyes were tearing up because of the dust. Yi Caixue widened his eyes in the flying dust, chose a favorable terrain, and kept climbing upwards. When he approached the enemy's second bunker and was about to use a grenade to blow it up, he saw clearly that the enemy's third bunker was six meters to the right front of this bunker. His position was dangerous, because if he blew up the second bunker first, the enemy in the third bunker would definitely shoot at him immediately, making it difficult for him to blow it up again. If he blew up the third bunker first, the enemy in the second bunker would also turn their guns to shoot at him. But now, the enemy in the second bunker was frantically returning fire at Sun Zhanyuan, and the enemy in the third bunker was still blocking the road he had just crawled over, which was favorable to him. He decided to take this opportunity to blow up both bunkers at the same time.

Yi Caixue continued to climb nimbly upwards, tightly holding grenades and demolition charges. He stopped between the two bunkers and carefully observed. He saw that the second bunker was an open-air fortification made of steel plates, with five enemies inside firing machine guns. The other two enemies were holding two flamethrowers, also looking for targets to spray. In the third fortification built by the enemy with sacks, in addition to a heavy machine gun and two light machine guns firing, two gunners were guarding a 60mm mortar, and the gunner of a recoilless gun was also aiming at the counterattack route of our army's soldiers. Time was very tight, and Yi Caixue became more and more anxious as he watched. If he didn't blow up these two firing points immediately, what a great loss it would bring to the counterattack troops! But it was also very difficult for him to continuously blow up two bunkers. He was right in the middle of the two bunkers, and both sides were no more than three meters away from him. During continuous blasting, he could not immediately leave the explosion range, which would bring him great danger. But at this critical moment, Yi Caixue did not hesitate at all. He tied the two demolition charges tightly together, and took off the grenades and hand grenades from his waist and placed them beside him. He rolled towards the second fortification, threw two demolition charges into the fortification with both hands, and quickly turned around and threw a grenade and three hand grenades into the third fortification. With a deafening roar, the enemy's two bunkers and machine guns flew up, and the enemy's scattered limbs also flew outside the fortifications. Yi Caixue himself was also stunned.

At this time, Sun Zhanyuan, who was hiding in the shell crater and using fierce machine-gun fire to cover Yi Caixue, saw that the enemy's two bunkers had been blown up at the same time, and immediately picked up his machine gun and ran upwards. However, at this time, the enemy's last firing point—the fourth bunker—fired at him again, and the machine gun fired more and more fiercely, and his legs were broken. But this great warrior endured the pain and still struggled to crawl from the pool of blood to where Yi Caixue was lying. At this time, Yi Caixue had just woken up, and he threw himself beside Sun Zhanyuan. Sun Zhanyuan saw that he was very tired and did not want to give him a new task—the task of blowing up the fourth firing point. However, Sun Zhanyuan's action of crawling in with broken legs and insisting on commanding moved Yi Caixue to tears. He said to Sun Zhanyuan: "Platoon Leader, please rest assured, I will be like you. As long as I am here, I will be able to complete the task!" Saying this, he took out the emergency kit to bandage Sun Zhanyuan's leg. But Sun Zhanyuan refused him. The enemy's machine guns were firing fiercely, and he couldn't stay here for long; moreover, more importantly, he needed to blow up the enemy's last firing point in the shortest possible time so that the counterattack troops could wipe out the enemy as soon as possible. He firmly ordered Yi Caixue: "Don't worry about me first. For the sake of the overall victory, you go and blow up the enemy's bunker, and I will cover you!" So Yi Caixue picked up the demolition charge and crawled forward with the determination to avenge the platoon leader and complete the task.

Yi Caixue crawled forward quickly, and the sound of Sun Zhanyuan's machine gun sounded behind him. Sun Zhanyuan was fiercely shooting at the enemy, attracting the enemy's firepower. The alert Yi Caixue used the enemy's corpse as cover and quickly climbed under a rock. It turned out that the enemy's fourth machine-gun fortification was set up on top of this rock, more than ten meters high from him. There was no road anymore. Yi Caixue grabbed the protruding rocks tightly with his hands and climbed upwards cautiously. At this moment, the sound of a grenade explosion came from Platoon Leader Sun Zhanyuan. This immortal Communist Party member, the great hero of the Volunteer Army, blew up seven enemies who had detoured up, and also heroically sacrificed himself at the same time.

Yi Caixue had lost the cover of the machine gun. The enemy's machine guns were frantically sweeping outside the fortification. Yi Caixue took advantage of the gap in the enemy's machine-gun fire, climbed into the trench in front of the enemy's fortification, and then pressed his body tightly between the two gun emplacements of the enemy's fortification. The enemy commander was issuing orders in the fortification, and all six gun emplacements were firing bullets fiercely, and two flamethrowers were also shooting out red flames. Yi Caixue quickly raised his hands and threw a demolition charge fiercely from the top into the fortification, and then rolled down from the steep rock. The enemy's fourth firing point was thus destroyed.

It only took twenty minutes from blasting the first firing point to destroying the fourth firing point. The road to the charge had been opened up. Under the steep rock, this heroic and resourceful soldier blew his loud bugle, which was his signal to call for the counterattack troops to charge forward. The soldiers waiting for the counterattack in the tunnel and in various hiding places immediately charged up the mountain together with the sound of the charge. Yi Caixue became the vanguard of the counterattack troops again. He was the first to climb up the steep rock, set up two machine guns abandoned by the enemy, and fired more than 1,400 bullets continuously at the enemies who counterattacked, killing and wounding more than 100 enemies. In just ten minutes of fierce fighting, a battalion of the enemy was mostly wiped out by our soldiers, and the position of the forward platoon completely returned to the hands of the soldiers.

The shock platoon leader who gloriously sacrificed in this battle, the immortal Communist Party member Sun Zhanyuan, was from Gongshui Village, Fourth District, Lin County, Henan Province, and was twenty-seven years old this year. He had been awarded two third-class merits in the Fifth Battle and the defensive operations. After the victory of the Shangganling battle, he was honorably posthumously awarded the title of Special-Class Hero by the Volunteer Army leadership and awarded the glorious title of Second-Class Hero. He has become a new shining example of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The heroic and resourceful young soldier Yi Caixue is from Sibao Village, Gengdiba District, Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, and is twenty-three years old this year. He was rated as a Special-Class Hero after the war and also won the glorious title of Second-Class Hero.

    孙占元和易才学
    新华社记者  石峰
    在上甘岭战役中，中国人民志愿军涌现了无数可歌可泣的英雄人物。他们高度的自我牺牲精神和机智灵活的战斗作风，生动地表现了人民战士对祖国与和平事业无比忠诚的高贵品质以及蔑视敌人、压倒一切的英雄气概。中国共产党员、突击排长孙占元和中国新民主主义青年团员、爆破手易才学，就是这样的人物。
    在战斗的第一天，美国侵略军在上午用四个营的兵力向金化以北的上甘岭右侧五九七点九高地进行了十四次的猛烈攻击，但都被中国人民志愿军战士们英勇地打退了。到了下午，当战士们主动转入坑道作战以后，一个营的敌人才爬上了我军前沿排的野战工事，并且用钢板、木材和麻袋垒成了一连串露天的火力地堡。敌人的轻重机枪、火焰喷射器、六零炮以及无座力炮疯狂地从这些地堡里打出来，严密地封锁住了我军的反击道路。
    这个前沿阵地是我军战士们用自己的血和汗建筑起来的阵地，是他们一年以来用自己的生命保卫着的阵地。现在，敌人的兽蹄踏上了这个阵地，战士们怎能答应敌人呆下去呢。他们隐蔽在坑道里，愤怒地等待着反击的命令，随时准备着去夺回它。共产党员孙占元被指定为反击部队的突击排长，英勇机智的战士易才学是突击班的第一名爆破手。出击的一切准备工作都做好了，突击排的战士们静静地站在坑道口，目不转睛地监视着敌人。
    天渐渐黑了，反击的炮火直向敌人轰过去，敌人的工事大部被摧毁了。孙占元带着突击排的战士们冲出了坑道，猛不可当地一直冲向敌人。当他们接近敌人地堡仅一百公尺时，残存的四个地堡里的十六挺机枪发射出了密集的火力，突击排的冲锋受到了挫折。这时，孙占元一面派人和坑道里的反击部队联络，一面就命令易才学向敌人的第一个火力点前进。
    易才学马上冒着敌人的火力跳过一个个的弹坑和交错着的交通沟，敏捷地摸到了敌人的第一个火力点跟前，顺利地把它炸毁了。但是这时易才学就暴露在敌人的面前，第二个火力点里的敌人向他猛射起来。
    易才学几次想从弹坑中冲出去，但密集的机枪子弹使他几次都未能抬起头来。这时，他忽然听见左边传过来排长孙占元的声音：“从右边上，我掩护你！”接着，孙占元的机枪就猛烈地射击起来，敌人第二个火力点里的火力立刻被吸引到左边去了。易才学站起来急忙从右边向上跑，可是敌人又打起了照明弹，阵地上顿时就像白昼一样，易才学的行动又被敌人发觉了。第三个地堡里的机枪也突然扫射起来，易才学立即伏在被炮弹捣成的松土上，尽量压低着自己的身体向前爬进，避开敌人打来的子弹。在他爬行过的路上变成了一条田沟。子弹一排接一排地从他头上飞过去，或者射进他身旁的松土里。他满头满脸都溅满子弹射起来的灰尘，眼睛里也因为尘土飞扬而流着泪水。易才学就在尘土飞扬中睁大了双眼，选择有利的地形，不停地向上爬着。当他接近了敌人的第二个地堡，正想用手雷爆破它时，他看清在这个地堡右前方六公尺的地方就是敌人的第三个地堡。他的位置是危险的，因为如果在这里先爆破第二个地堡，那么第三个地堡里的敌人必然会马上向他射击，这样他再要去爆破它就困难了。如果先去炸掉第三个地堡，第二个地堡里的敌人也会转过枪来向他射击。而现在，第二个地堡里的敌人正在疯狂地向孙占元还击，第三个地堡里的敌人还在封锁着他刚才爬过来的道路，情况对他是有利的。他决心乘这机会同时爆破这两个地堡。
    易才学紧抱着手雷和爆破筒继续敏捷地向上爬去，到了这两个地堡之间就停下细细观察。他看见第二个地堡是用钢板垒成的露天工事，里面有五个敌人正在抱着机枪射击，另外的两个敌人手里握着两具火焰喷射器，也在寻找着喷射目标。在敌人用麻袋垒成的第三个工事里，除了有一挺重机枪和两挺轻机枪正在射击外，有两个炮手守在一门六零炮旁，一门无座力炮的炮手也正对准着我军战士们的反击道路。时间是非常紧迫的，易才学愈看愈急，如果现在不马上炸毁这两个火力点，便会给反击部队带来多么大的损失！但他要连续爆破两个地堡也非常困难，他正好在两个地堡中间，双方离他都不过三公尺，在连续爆破时，他不能立刻离开爆炸范围，这就会给他带来极大的危险。但在这紧要关头，易才学并没有一点犹豫，他把两根爆破筒紧紧地捆在一起，把腰里的手雷和手榴弹也取下来放在身边。他滚向第二个工事，双手把两根爆破筒掷进工事里，又迅速转过身来，把一颗手雷和三个手榴弹投进第三个工事里。一阵震天的巨响，敌人的两个地堡和机枪都飞起来了，敌人零乱的四肢也飞到工事外面。易才学自己也被震昏过去了。
    这时，隐蔽在弹坑里用猛烈的机枪火力掩护着易才学的孙占元，看到敌人的两个地堡被同时爆破了，就立刻提起机枪向上跑。但是，这时敌人的最后一个火力点——第四个地堡又向他开火了，而且机枪愈打愈猛，他的双腿被打断了。可是这个伟大的战士忍受着痛苦，仍旧从血泊里挣扎着爬向易才学躺着的地方。这时，易才学刚刚清醒过来，他一下扑到了孙占元的身旁。孙占元看见他十分疲劳，心里不愿再把新的任务——爆破第四个火力点的任务交给他。但是，孙占元断腿爬进，坚持指挥的行动使易才学激动得流出了热泪。他对孙占元说：“排长，请你放心，我会像你一样。只要我人在，我一定能够完成任务！”说着，他掏出救急包就要把孙占元的腿包扎起来。但是孙占元拒绝了他。敌人的机枪打得很凶，在这里是不能多停留的；而且，更重要的是需要在最短的时间内把敌人最后的火力点炸毁，使反击部队能够尽快地歼灭敌人。他坚决地命令易才学：“先不要管我，为了整个的胜利，你马上去爆破敌人的地堡，我来掩护你！”于是易才学就拿起爆破筒，怀着一定要为排长报仇，一定要完成任务的心情向前爬进。
    易才学迅速地向前爬着，他的后面响起了孙占元的机枪声。孙占元和敌人猛烈地对射着，吸引着敌人的火力。机警的易才学就用敌人的尸体作掩护，迅速爬在一座岩石下。原来敌人第四个机枪工事正设在这座岩石的顶上，离他有十多公尺高。道路已经没有了，易才学用手紧抓着突出的石块，小心翼翼地向上爬去。正在这时，从孙占元排长那里传来了手榴弹的爆炸声，这个不朽的共产党员、志愿军伟大的英雄，炸死了迂回上来的七个敌人，自己也同时壮烈牺牲了。
    易才学已经失去机枪的掩护了。敌人的机枪慌乱地向工事外面扫射着，易才学利用敌人机枪射击的间隙，爬进了敌人工事前的交通沟，随即又把身体紧贴在敌人工事的两个枪眼之间。敌人的指挥官正在工事里发着命令，六个枪眼都一齐猛烈地放射着枪弹，两门火焰喷射器也射出了红红的烈火。易才学敏捷地举起双手，把一根爆破筒猛地从顶上投进工事里，接着一翻身便从陡岩上滚下来，敌人的第四个火力点就这样被炸毁了。
    从爆炸第一个火力点到炸毁第四个火力点，仅仅只有二十分钟的时间。冲锋的道路已经打开了，在陡岩的下面，这位英勇机智的战士吹起了响亮的小喇叭，这是他呼唤反击部队冲锋前进的信号。在坑道里、在各个隐蔽部里等待反击的战士们立刻随着冲锋的号声一齐冲上山来。易才学又成了反击部队的最先锋，他第一个爬上陡岩，架起了两挺敌人丢弃的机枪，连续向反击上来的敌人发射了一千四百多发子弹，毙伤了一百多个敌人。仅仅十分钟的激战，一个营的敌人就被我军战士们大部歼灭了，前沿排的阵地就完整地回到了战士们的手里。
    在这次战斗中光荣牺牲的突击排长，不朽的共产党员孙占元，是河南省林县四区弓水村人，今年二十七岁。他在第五次战役和防御作战中，曾立过两次三等功。在这次上甘岭战役胜利结束后，他光荣地被志愿军领导机关追认为特等功臣，并授予二级英雄的光荣称号。他已经成为中国人民志愿军爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的新的光辉榜样。英勇机智的青年战士易才学，是贵州省黔西县耕地坝区四保村人，今年二十三岁。他在战后被评为特等功臣，也获得了二级英雄的光荣称号。
