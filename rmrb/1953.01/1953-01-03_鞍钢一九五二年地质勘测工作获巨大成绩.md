The geological survey organization of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been greatly strengthened. The total number of personnel in the Geology Department has increased more than fourfold compared to 1951. Among them, the number of geological technicians has reached more than twice the highest number during the puppet Manchukuo era; the number of technical workers, specifically drillers, has increased sixfold compared to 1951, and nineteenfold compared to the highest number during the puppet Manchukuo era; twenty-four veteran cadres transferred from production departments and various regions have taken on positions above section and team leader. The Geology Department now has seven working teams, including drilling, trenching, surveying, drilling machine maintenance, drilling machine installation, and engineering geology, as well as a drilling training class with more than 300 people, and is building a specialized repair plant for drilling machines. In terms of equipment, the state's investment in 1952 was nine times that of 1951, and the number of drilling machines in operation in 1952 reached eleven times that of the puppet Manchukuo era. In 1952, the staff of the department undertook arduous geological survey work in more than 40 construction sites in the mountains and fields around Anshan, spanning 250 kilometers, and in mineral research and mapping workshops. The achievements far exceeded the work done during the Japanese imperialist occupation.

The area of mineral resource survey conducted by the Geology Department in 1952 was equal to the total area surveyed in the past three years. Moreover, detailed surveys were carried out in the main mining areas, which had never been done during the puppet Manchukuo era. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, a concentrated and intensive drilling survey policy was implemented. In 1952 alone, 75 boreholes were drilled, with a total depth of 10,600 meters, which is two and a half times the total depth drilled during the Japanese imperialist occupation. This determined the detailed situation of the confirmed mineral reserves, ore composition, and ore deposit structure at a certain level in the three main mining areas, and provided technical design data for more than 20 years of mining. This fundamentally changed the blind mining situation left by Japanese imperialism. In terms of engineering geology, data needed for the technical design of the massive projects in 1953 were provided, with a total of 880 boreholes drilled, and 2,602 large and small soil samples collected. The total depth drilled in various soil and rock layers was 6,600 meters, which is 30 times that of 1951. The engineering geological drilling work of the department in 1952 was carried out in accordance with advanced Soviet technology and strict procedures, so that the new construction projects in 1953 could be guaranteed in terms of engineering quality and economic rationality from the design stage. In terms of surveying and mapping, the total area of mining area topography and plant base measurement was 194 million square meters, and the measurement of various pipeline traffic routes reached 600 kilometers. In the underground waterway investigation work, the excavation and repair of earthwork alone reached 106,000 cubic meters. The total number of various drawings made in one year to provide design data was 10,700. With the help of Soviet experts, a plant-wide master plan was also developed for the first time, providing a basis for overall design.

The scale of geological surveys conducted by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Geology Department in 1952 was unprecedented, and the achievements were also very significant, but the current technical level is still not up to the requirements of the work. For example, when conducting hydrogeological surveys of mines, no one knows the survey methods and can only inquire everywhere; after each geophysical exploration is completed, it is still necessary to go to Beijing and Changchun to find people to summarize; the analysis of ore particle size cannot be done yet. Therefore, it is necessary to step up the study of advanced Soviet experience and improve the technical level.

    鞍钢一九五二年地质勘测工作获巨大成绩
    国营鞍山钢铁公司的地质勘测机构已大大加强。地质处的全体人员比一九五一年增加四倍多。其中地质技术人员已达伪满时代最多年份的二倍以上；技术工人中只钻探工就比一九五一年增加六倍，为伪满时代最高年份的十九倍；从生产部门和各地区调来的老干部，担任科、队长以上职务的就有二十四名。地质处已设有钻探、槽探、测量、钻机、钻机安装、工程地质等七个工作队，和一个三百多人的钻探训练班，并正在建设着一个专门修配钻机的修配厂。在设备方面，一九五二年国家投资等于一九五一年的九倍，一九五二年开动的钻探机的台数已达伪满时代的十一倍。该处工作人员一九五二年已在鞍山外围纵横二百五十公里山野间的四十多个工地上，在矿物研究、制图等作业室里，担负起艰巨的地质勘测工作，所取得的成绩远远超过日本帝国主义经营时期所做的工作。
    地质处一九五二年所进行的矿山资源勘测面积，等于过去三年间所调查的总合。而且在主要矿区进行了伪满时代所未有过的精查。按苏联专家的指导，实行了集中密集钻探的勘测方针。一九五二年一年间钻孔即达七十五个，总深度为一万零六百公尺，为日本帝国主义经营期间钻进总深度的二倍半。由此决定了三个主要矿区在水准面一定位置上的确定矿量、矿石成分，及矿床结构的详细情况，提出了可供开采二十多年的技术设计资料。从而根本改变了日本帝国主义所留下的盲目开采状况。在工程地质方面，给一九五三年巨大工程提供了技术设计所需要的资料，共钻孔八百八十个，采大、小土样二千六百零二个，在各种土层、岩层中钻进总深度为六千六百公尺，等于一九五一年的三十倍。该处一九五二年的工程地质钻探工作，是按照苏联的先进技术与严格的程序来做的，使一九五三年新建工程首先能从设计上来保证工程质量和经济合理。在测绘方面，矿区地形和厂基测量面积共计有一亿九千四百万平方公尺，各种管道交通路线的测量长达六百公里。在地下水道调查工作中，仅挖掘与修复土方即达十万六千立方公尺。一年中为提供设计资料所制作的各种图纸，共计有一万零七百张。在苏联专家帮助下，并制订了从来未有的全厂总平面图，给整体设计准备了根据。
    一九五二年鞍钢地质处所进行的地质勘测规模是空前的，成绩也是非常巨大的，但现有技术水平还赶不上工作的要求。如要作矿山水文调查没有人懂得调查方法，只得到处去查询；每次进行物理探矿完了，尚需奔走北京、长春去找人总结；矿石粒度的分析工作到现在还不会作。因此，必须加紧学习苏联先进经验，把技术水平提高一步。
