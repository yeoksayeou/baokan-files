The communist party of the working class has always relied on criticism and self-criticism to move forward. The concluding remarks, point five, of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" teach us: If the party becomes arrogant and conceited due to success, and is afraid to admit and correct its mistakes, then the party cannot fulfill its role as the leader of the working class; if the party is not afraid of criticism and self-criticism and is good at correcting its mistakes in time, then the party is invincible; if the party conceals its mistakes and cannot tolerate criticism and self-criticism, then the party will inevitably perish. Precisely for this reason, the party must constantly ensure the development of criticism and self-criticism, and as Comrade Malenkov said, "regard those who hinder the unfolding of criticism of our shortcomings, suppress criticism, and persecute and retaliate against critics as deadly enemies of the party, and wage a relentless struggle against them." Also, precisely for this reason, the new party constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulates regarding the duties of members: "Carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate them, oppose superficial achievements, and oppose complacency with achievements in work. Suppression of criticism is a serious evil. Anyone who stifles criticism and replaces criticism with praise cannot remain in the party ranks." "Report shortcomings in work to the party's leading organs up to the Central Committee of the Party, regardless of who is involved. Party members have no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations and ignore incorrect actions that harm the interests of the party and the state. Anyone who hinders party members from fulfilling this obligation should be severely punished as a violator of the party's will."
	Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party has always regarded criticism and self-criticism as a fundamental issue in party building. In the speech "Get Organized!", Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "We must develop self-criticism, face erroneous tendencies squarely, and conscientiously implement corrections. If we do not criticize bureaucratic tendencies in local work, and do not criticize warlordist tendencies in military work, then we are willing to preserve the Kuomintang style, willing to preserve the dust of bureaucracy and warlordism on our pure faces, and that is not being a good party member." The general program of the Chinese Communist Party Constitution stipulates: "The Chinese Communist Party should use the method of criticism and self-criticism to constantly review the errors and shortcomings in its work, to educate its members and cadres, and to correct its mistakes in time. The Chinese Communist Party opposes that kind of arrogance, fear of admitting its mistakes, and fear of criticism and self-criticism." The standard for party members passed by the first national organizational work conference of the Chinese Communist Party stipulates: "Every Communist Party member should constantly use the method of criticism and self-criticism to review the errors and shortcomings in their work, and correct them in time. Anyone who has serious errors that they cannot correct, and who is complacent, arrogant, and persists in their errors, cannot be a communist party member."
	According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on developing criticism and self-criticism, our party has, in the rectification movements, party consolidation movements, and "Three-Anti" movements of past years, in the process of examining work and handling people's letters, and in the process of implementing the Central Committee's "Decision on展开 Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" since April 1950, strived to expose and criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of many party members, especially leading party members, so that these party members and the entire party received education, and the work was improved. As for those incorrigible degenerate elements who refused to admit and correct their mistakes, feared criticism, and suppressed criticism, the party regarded them as deadly enemies and carried out a serious and merciless struggle against them. For example, in 1952, the party's struggle against the corruption and degeneration of Liu Qingshan and others, and the struggle against the incident of Zhou Jifang and others framing Ji Kaifu, are well known to the entire party and the people of the whole country. Obviously, the party's removal of these bad elements did not weaken but strengthened the party, and strengthened the party's connection with the broad masses of party members and the broad masses of the people.
	Such struggles are undoubtedly very fierce. However, does this mean that everyone has learned a lesson? Unfortunately, this is not the case. Not only the teachings of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong on criticism and self-criticism, not only the resolutions and instructions of the Party Central Committee on developing and guaranteeing criticism from below, are ignored by some gentlemen, but even in the midst of the "Three-Anti" and party consolidation struggles, as long as the spearhead of the party's struggle does not directly touch them, they are always indifferent and remain the same. Huang Yifeng, the director of the Communications Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, is one of these gentlemen.
	In the East China Technical School of Communications that Huang Yifeng presided over, he implemented a patriarchal management style with a serious bureaucratic attitude. On December 3, 1951, the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily published an anonymous letter from Xue Chengfeng, a student at the school, criticizing the chaotic phenomena in the school's teaching, academic system, etc., and the extravagance and waste in the school's expenses, and putting forward suggestions for improvement. Huang Yifeng completely violated the Party Central Committee's decision to展开 criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, and not only did he not examine himself at all, but he also convened a series of mass meetings, inciting students and staff to track down and "struggle" against the person who wrote the letter. Since Huang Yifeng so frantically suppressed legitimate criticism, he had already placed himself in the position of a deadly enemy of the party. But the deadly enemy of the party usually does not stop at this point. Since he resolutely refuses to acknowledge the principles, order, and discipline stipulated by the party, and he is a "leader," he is bound to implement his own anti-party principles, order, and discipline, and he is bound to further confront the party. Therefore, he incited the masses to slander and deceive the party newspaper, deprived the critic and the party newspaper of the freedom to communicate directly and secretly, resisted the East China Bureau's Discipline Inspection Committee and the East China Education Department's instructions to stop the meeting to struggle against Xue Chengfeng, he wanted to expel Xue Chengfeng without authorization, and he resisted and sabotaged the East China Bureau's inspection team's inspection. Here, Huang Yifeng has completely gone down the anti-party road, and he has lost the qualifications to be a communist party member. It was necessary and inevitable for the Discipline Inspection Committee of the East China Bureau to expel him from the party.
	The Huang Yifeng incident exposed three problems of some party members in our party. First, the Kuomintang style still has a considerable influence among some party members. Although the rule of the Kuomintang has perished, its spiritual influence will not die at the same time, and it will remain for a long time, continuing to poison people's hearts. Therefore, while eliminating the hidden remnants of counter-revolutionaries, we must use tireless efforts to resolutely and ruthlessly eliminate this spiritual influence of counter-revolutionary rule, and eliminate bureaucracy and hegemonic style. Second, some party members who hold leading positions (from village chiefs and militia squad leaders onwards) still have an extremely dangerous tendency to regard the units they lead as independent kingdoms, to do whatever they want, to resist the leadership of the party, and to split the party. In their independent kingdoms, they regard the party members, members of the Youth League, and the masses they lead as their own subjects, and regard the state property they manage as their own private property. They believe that the party's discipline and the state's laws do not apply to them. Therefore, the task of the party is to thoroughly disband all these independent kingdoms, and to ensure the unity of the party and the unity of the state. Third, these leading cadres still have an absurd idea that the party will eventually compromise and yield to them, and reach an understanding with them, and will no longer annoy them, because they are party members with status and history, and they cannot be treated differently. Indeed, some party organizations have treated those who have made mistakes in this way (for example, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee did so in dealing with the criminal acts of Liu Qingshan and Wang Zhenhai), which has further emboldened them. But the party must not only completely eliminate their "misunderstandings," but also completely eliminate the "misunderstandings" of anyone else on this issue. History and status are not some kind of bank deposit or safe deposit box that can give anyone the freedom to do whatever they want; on the contrary, if a person cherishes their history and status, they would never think of asking the party and the state for this "freedom" that they will never need, and the party and the state will never give anyone this "freedom."
	But we must also learn more lessons from the Huang Yifeng incident. This incident warns us that the democratic life within our party and the democratic life of the masses must be greatly strengthened. At present, this kind of democratic life is still abnormal in many places, and many bullies who have sneaked into the party are still able to act recklessly in the name of the party, tyrannize the people, and rape public opinion. This incident warns us that the party's principles of developing self-criticism and criticism from below, and the party's principles of discipline, must be conscientiously implemented. At present, these principles have not yet been deeply rooted in people's hearts, so that those bad elements who violate the party's principles are still able to act lawlessly, intimidate the masses, and capture the masses. This incident warns us that the party's ideological work must be conscientiously improved. The party's Marxist-Leninist education is still very weak, and the education on the party's basic principles, the party constitution, the party's discipline and democracy, the party's policies, and the party's resolutions is still very weak. All party members and party organizations should be educated: the party must not be an appendage of state organs, and party organizations must not be an appendage of any administrative organ or administrative负责人; it must educate, supervise, and manage all party members according to party principles, ensuring that they are loyal and honest to the party, abide by the party's discipline and the resolutions of the Party Central Committee, respect the criticism of the party newspaper and the criticism of the masses, connect with the masses rather than be detached from the masses, and serve the masses rather than suppress the masses. This incident also teaches us that the party's understanding of cadres and the party's understanding of the organizational life of lower-level parties is still very insufficient, so that people like Huang Yifeng can hold important positions, and so that events like his evil deeds and many similar events are not discovered and dealt with quickly. The party is still easily deceived by people like Huang Yifeng, only seeing some achievements in their work and easily trusting them, lightly listening to and being satisfied with their one-sided reports. Even the editorial department of this newspaper, on June 8, 1952, published a reply from the East China Technical School of Communications that was obviously fabricated, because it lightly believed their "proof." Only by fully accepting the lessons can we do our work better; and the entire Chinese Communist Party, relying on the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the warm support of the broad masses of party and non-party activists, can undoubtedly overcome the resistance of any Huang Yifeng and his ilk, and do its work better.
	The party organizations, party leading organs, party newspapers, party discipline inspection committees, educational organs, and organizations of the Communist Youth League and student unions across the country must improve their work because of the lessons of the Huang Yifeng incident. All party organizations that are studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and party organizations that are consolidating the party in accordance with the standards of Communist Party members, must, in the process of study, check their own situation in connection with the Huang Yifeng incident, and draw necessary conclusions for improving democratic life within and outside the party, for improving the education on the development of criticism and the strict observance of discipline within the party, and for improving the party's ideological work and cadre work. People similar to Huang Yifeng should also learn a lesson from this. They should know that the party regards those who suppress criticism as deadly enemies, and if they do not resolutely correct their mistakes, the party will never tolerate them. The attitude of our party towards those who make mistakes is "curing the disease to save the person," but there is a limit; for those who have committed serious crimes in their current work, and for those incorrigible elements who have repeatedly made mistakes in history and have not been reformed despite repeated education, the party must resolutely remove them in order to maintain the communist purity of the party. The people of the whole country should also learn a lesson from the Huang Yifeng incident: never be afraid of the attacks and retaliation of bad elements who act in the name of the party, and do not be deceived by their lies; the dark phenomena can only be local and temporary. With the support of Comrade Mao Zedong and our Party Central Committee, all Communist Party members and the people of the whole country should bravely and without reservation展开 an uncompromising struggle against all bad elements who suppress criticism and do evil. People's democratic China is the era of Mao Zedong, the era when those who uphold truth and justice are victorious. We should unite as one and actively strive to eradicate all poisonous legacies of the old era. Only in this way can our great country move forward smoothly, and the realization of our great national construction plan can be guaranteed.

### 压制批评的人是党的死敌

    压制批评的人是党的死敌
    工人阶级的共产主义的政党从来是依靠批评与自我批评前进的。苏联共产党历史简明教程的结束语第五条教导我们：如果党因被成功所薰醉而开始骄傲起来，害怕承认和纠正自己的错误，那末，党就不能实现其为工人阶级领导者的作用；如果党不害怕批评与自我批评，善于及时改正自己的错误，那末，党就是不可被战胜的；如果党隐瞒自己的错误，不能容忍批评和自我批评，那末，党就会不免于灭亡。正因为这样，党必须经常保证批评和自我批评的发展，并且像马林科夫同志所说的那样，“把那些阻碍对我们的缺点展开批评、压制批评和对批评者实行迫害和报复的人，当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争”。也正因为这样，苏联共产党新党章关于党员的义务规定：“开展自我批评和自下而上的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对表面成绩，反对满足于工作中的成就。压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评、以歌功颂德代替批评的人，都不能留在党的队伍里。”“向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党和国家利益的不正确行动。凡是妨碍党员履行这项义务的人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩。”
    中国共产党在毛泽东同志领导下，经常把批评和自我批评看作党的建设的根本问题。在“组织起来”的演说中，毛泽东同志着重地指出：“必须开展自我批评，正视错误倾向，认真实行改正。如果在地方工作中不批评官僚主义倾向，在军队工作中不批评军阀主义倾向，那就是愿意保存国民党作风，愿意保存官僚主义灰尘与军阀主义灰尘在自己纯洁的脸上，那就不是一个好党员。”中国共产党党章总纲规定：“中国共产党应该用批评和自我批评的方法，经常检讨自己工作中的错误和缺点，来教育自己的党员和干部，并及时纠正自己的错误。中国共产党反对那种自高自大、害怕承认自己错误、害怕批评与自我批评的情绪。”中国共产党第一次全国组织工作会议通过的党员标准中规定：“每一个共产党员，应该经常地用批评与自我批评的方法，检讨自己工作的错误和缺点，并及时地加以纠正。谁如果是一个有了严重的错误而不能改正、并居功骄傲、自高自大、坚持错误的人，谁就不能作共产党员。”
    根据党中央和毛泽东同志关于发展批评和自我批评的指示，我们党曾在历年的整风运动、整党运动和“三反”运动中，在检查工作和处理人民来信的过程中，在一九五○年四月以来执行中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”的过程中，努力地揭露和批评了许多党员特别是领导党员的缺点和错误，使这些党员和全党得到了教育，使工作得到了改进，而对于那些拒绝承认和纠正错误，害怕批评和压制批评的不可救药的堕落分子，党就当作死敌而进行了严肃无情的斗争。例如在一九五二年，党对于刘青山等贪污蜕化行为的斗争，对于周季方等诬陷纪凯夫的事件所作的斗争，就是全党和全国人民所熟知的。很明显，党清除了这些坏分子，不是削弱了而是加强了党，加强了党和广大的党员群众、广大的人民群众的联系。
    这样的斗争无疑地是非常剧烈的。然而，这是不是就可以使每个人都得到了教训呢？很可惜，并不是这样。不但列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志关于批评和自我批评的教导，不但党中央关于开展和保障自下而上的批评的决议和指示，在有些老爷们是置若罔闻，甚至就在“三反”和整党的斗争中间，只要党的斗争的锋芒没有直接触及他们本人的时候，他们总是无动于中、依然故我的。华东军政委员会交通部部长黄逸峰就是这些老爷中间的一个。
    黄逸峰在他所主持的华东交通专科学校中，以严重的官僚主义态度实行家长式的管理。一九五一年十二月三日，人民日报读者来信栏发表了该校学生薛承凤批评学校教学、学制等方面的混乱现象和学校开支中的铺张浪费现象，并提出改进建议的匿名信。黄逸峰完全违反党中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定，不但毫不检讨，反而召集一连串的群众会议，煽动学生和职工起来追查和“斗争”写信的人。黄逸峰既然如此疯狂地压制正当批评，他就已经把自己放在党的死敌的地位。但是党的死敌照例是不会走到这一步就停止的。他既然坚决不承认党所规定的原则、秩序和纪律，而他又是一个“领导者”，他就必然贯彻自己的反党的原则、秩序和纪律，他就必然要进一步和党对抗。因此，他就煽动群众去污蔑党报和欺骗党报，剥夺批评者和党报直接通信、秘密通信的自由，他就抗拒华东局纪律检查委员会和华东教育部阻止开会斗争薛承凤的指示，他就要擅自开除薛承凤，他就抗拒和破坏华东局检查组的检查。在这里，黄逸峰就完全走到反党的路上去了，他已经丧失了当作共产党员的条件。华东局纪律检查委员会开除了他的党籍，是必要的和不可避免的。
    黄逸峰事件暴露了我们党内一部分党员的三个问题。第一，国民党作风还在一部分党员中间有不小的影响。国民党的统治虽然已经灭亡了，但是它的精神影响是不会同时死掉的，它还要遗留很久，继续毒害人心。因此，我们在肃清隐蔽的残余的反革命分子同时，必须要用不疲倦的努力来坚决无情地肃清反革命统治的这种精神影响，肃清官僚主义和恶霸作风。第二，在一部分担负领导职务（从村长、民兵小队长起）的党员还有一种把自己所领导的单位当做独立王国而为所欲为、反抗党的领导和分裂党的极端危险的倾向。在他们的独立王国里，他们把由他们领导的党员、团员和群众认为自己的臣民，把由他们管理的国家财产当作自己的私产，他们以为党的纪律和国家的法律对他们都不适用。因此，党的任务，就是彻底解散这一切独立王国，保证党的统一和国家的统一。第三，这一部分领导干部还有一种荒谬的设想，他们以为党终于要向他们妥协和屈服，和他们成立谅解，不再去惹他们生气，因为他们是有地位有历史的党员，不能不另眼相看。确实有过一些党的组织曾经这样对待那些犯错误的人（例如河北省委在对待刘青山、王振海的犯罪行为上就曾经如此），这就更鼓起了他们的勇气。但是党不但必须彻底消灭他们的这种“误解”，而且必须彻底消灭其他任何人在这个问题上的“误解”。历史和地位并不是这么一种银行存款和保险柜，可以使任何人有为非作歹的自由；相反，一个人如果爱护自己的历史和地位，他就无论如何也不会想起向党和国家要求这种他所永远不需要的“自由”，而党和国家也永远不会给任何人以这种“自由”。
    但是我们还必须从黄逸峰事件中得到更多的教训。这个事件警告我们：我们党内的民主生活和群众的民主生活，还必须极大地加强。现在这种民主生活在许多地方还是不正常的，许多混进党里来的恶霸分子还能够假借党的名义，横行霸道，强奸民意。这个事件警告我们：党的发展自我批评和自下而上的批评的原则，和党的纪律原则，还必须认真贯彻。现在这些原则还远没有深入人心，以致那些违反党的原则的坏分子，还能够无法无天，吓唬群众，俘掳群众。这个事件警告我们：党的思想工作还必须认真地改善。党的马克思列宁主义教育还十分薄弱，关于党的基本原理、党章、党的纪律和民主、党的政策和党的决议的教育还十分薄弱。应该教育所有的党员和党的组织：党必须不是国家机关的附属品，党的组织必须不是任何一个行政机关和行政负责人的附属品，它必须对所有党员按党的原则进行教育、监督和管理，保证他们对党忠诚老实，遵守党的纪律和党中央的决议，尊重党报的批评和群众的批评，联系群众而不是脱离群众，为群众服务而不是压制群众。这个事件又教训我们：党对于干部的了解、对下级党的组织生活状况的了解还十分不够，以致像黄逸峰这样的人竟能够身居要职，以致像他这样为非作歹的事件和许多同类事件，竟没有迅速地被发现和受到处理。党还很容易受黄逸峰之流的蒙蔽，只看到他们工作中的某些成绩而加以轻易的信任，轻于听信和满足于他们的片面的报告，连本报的编辑部也在一九五二年六月八日由于轻信他们的“证明”而发表了华东交通专科学校的显然是伪造事实的答复。我们只有充分接受教训，才能把我们的工作作得更好；而整个中国共产党，依靠党中央的正确领导和广大的党和非党的积极分子热烈的支持，毫无疑问，是一定可以战胜任何黄逸峰之流的抵抗，而把工作作得更好的。
    全国各地党的组织、党的领导机关、党的报纸、党的纪律检查委员会、教育机关、青年团和学生会的组织，都要因为黄逸峰事件的教训而改进自己的工作。所有正在学习联共第十九次代表大会文件的党组织，正在按照共产党员标准进行整党的党组织，都要在学习过程中，联系黄逸峰事件而检查本身的状况，对于改善党内和党外的民主生活，对于改善党内的开展批评的教育和严守纪律的教育，对于改善党的思想工作和干部工作，得出必要的结论。类似黄逸峰的人也要由此吸取教训。他们要知道：党是把压制批评的人当作死敌的，如果他们不坚决改正错误，党是决不会宽容他们的。我们的党对于犯错误的人采取“治病救人”的态度是有限度的；对于那些在当前工作中犯有严重罪恶，以及在历史上屡犯错误而屡教不改的不可救药的分子，党一定要坚决地把他们清除出去，以保持党的共产主义的纯洁性。全国人民也要由黄逸峰事件中吸取教训：决不要害怕假借党的名义的坏分子的打击和报复，也不要被他们的谎言所欺骗；黑暗的现象只能是局部的、暂时的。在毛泽东同志和我们党中央的支持之下，全体共产党员和全国人民都应该英勇地、无所顾忌地对一切压制批评、为非作歹的坏分子展开不妥协的斗争。人民民主的中国是毛泽东的时代，是坚持真理正义的人得到胜利的时代。我们应该团结
    一致，积极努力来铲除旧时代一切毒害的遗留，只有这样，我们的伟大的国家才能顺利地前进，我们的伟大的国家建设计划的实现才能得到保证。
