    Do a good job of publicizing and explaining films
    --Reader's Letters Summary
    The question of how to help audiences understand movies has drawn the attention of some film projection units. When the Northeast Film Studio dubbed the East German film "Assembly of the Gods" and the Shanghai Film Studio dubbed the Czech film "Battle Before Dawn," subtitles and explanations were added to the beginning of the films, briefly introducing the content of the film; many cinemas and film projection teams have also created some good methods in the publicity and explanation of films. However, this work is still not widespread enough. Recently, we have received more reader letters reflecting the situation of not understanding the films and some suggestions, summarized as follows:
    Fang Yi from Kailuan Linxi Mining Union wrote that the second club of Kailuan Linxi Coal Mine often shows movies, but workers cannot understand some of them, or misunderstand the content of the films. Some workers said: "It's confusing, without beginning or end, and I don't understand what it means." Sometimes they even mistake the enemy for their own people. He believes that this is all because the publicity and explanation of the main content of the film is not enough. He suggests that some films should have written explanations at the beginning, with necessary narration, to briefly explain the content of the film, and that the main characters of each film can be shown in single shots at the beginning, with introductions of their identities, so that the audience can have a general understanding of the characters in the film.
    Zhang Yibin, a soldier from the Shahe Department of the Cangxian Sub-district of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote that after watching the Soviet film "The Snake King," some people did not understand the main content of the film, and some even mistakenly thought that the film was promoting superstition. He said: It can be seen that many viewers are just watching the excitement and have not really understood the educational significance of the film.
    He hopes that film projection units should consider the projection audience, take care of the audience's acceptance level, and do more publicity and explanation work before or during film screenings.
    Liu An from the Hangzhou Revolutionary University Branch wrote that some people did not understand some plots after watching the Soviet film "Donbass Miners." He suggested that cinemas should introduce the content of the film and the main characters in the film to the audience before showing the film.
    Cao Fencun, a reader from Fujian, wrote that during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the audience watched many Soviet films, and everyone felt greatly educated, but some films were not well understood by the audience. For example, when the film "Lenin in 1918" was shown, many farmers did not understand the main meaning of the film. Some said: "After watching this film, I don't even recognize who Lenin is."
    Cao Shouyu from the sixth team of the Film Projection Team of the Hunan Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau wrote that when they showed films to the masses, they used local blackboards, broadcasts, etc. to introduce the content of the film to the masses before the screening, and distributed film brochures, and also drew some slides explaining the main content of the film. For example, when they showed the film "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," they made slides of some of the main characters in the film and the scene of the Kuomintang dragging the Mongolian old man to death with horses, and introduced them to the masses. When the masses watched the film, they deeply understood the content of the film. Many people reflected: "The people's government's projection team plans for us everywhere, explains the content of the film for us, and also draws pictures to introduce the film. We all understand it completely."
    Cong Sen from Shandong Normal College in Jinan wrote that the cinemas in Jinan City did a very good job in publicizing and explaining the films during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Generally, they could issue brochures to introduce the content of the film. In order to take care of the illiterate audience, the content of the film was also explained by radio before the film was shown. However, after the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the publicity work of the films in the city's cinemas was relaxed again, some of which were not done well enough, and some were not done at all. Cong Sen said: Since publicity and explanation work is of great benefit to the audience, it should be persisted in.

    作好影片的宣传解释工作
    ——读者来信综述
    关于如何帮助观众看懂电影的问题已引起了一些电影放映单位的注意。东北电影制片厂在译制民主德国影片“群神会”和上海电影制片厂译制的捷克影片“黎明前的战斗”时，片头上都加了字幕和说明，概括地介绍了影片的内容；不少电影院和电影放映队在影片的宣传、解释工作上也创造了一些好办法。但目前这一工作仍作得不够普遍。最近我们又陆续收到一些读者来信反映看不懂影片的情况和一些建议，综述如下：
    开滦林西矿工会方艺来信说，开滦林西煤矿第二俱乐部经常放映电影，有些影片，工人们看不懂，或对影片内容发生误解，有的工人说：“看得糊里糊涂，没头没尾，到底是啥意思，搞不清楚。”有时会把敌人误认为自己人。他认为这都是因为对影片的主要内容宣传解释做的不够的缘故。他建议有些影片的片头应加文字说明，并配以必要的解说，概括说明影片的内容，并可以在每部影片的片头将影片的主要人物，用单人镜头映出，并辅以人物的身份介绍，使观众对影片中的人物有概括的了解。
    中国人民解放军沧县分区沙河部战士张毅斌来信说，他们看完苏联影片“蟒魔王”后，有些人并没有了解影片的主要内容是什么，有的甚至错误地认为这部影片是宣传迷信的。他说：可见不少观众是在看热闹，没有真正领会影片的教育意义。
    他希望电影放映单位应考虑放映对象，照顾观众的接受程度，在电影放映前或放映中多作宣传、解释工作。
    杭州革命大学分校柳岸来信说，有些人看了苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”后，有些情节不大明白。他建议电影院在放映电影前，应向观众介绍影片的内容及影片中的主要人物等。
    福建读者曹奋存来信说，“中苏友好月”中，观众看了不少苏联影片，大家都感到受了很大教育，但有些影片，观众看不大懂，如放映“列宁在一九一八”影片时，有许多农民看不懂影片的主要意思是什么，有的说：“我看了这部影片，连那个是列宁都不认得。”
    湖南省文化事业管理局电影放映队第六队曹守愚来信说，他们到群众中放映影片时，在放映前利用当地的黑板报、广播等，向群众介绍影片内容，并发影片说明书，还绘制了一些讲解影片主要内容的幻灯片。如他们放映“内蒙人民的胜利”影片时，把片中的一些主要人物和国民党用马活活拖死蒙古老头的镜头制成幻灯片，向群众介绍，群众看影片时，就深刻地了解了影片内容。许多人反映：“人民政府的放映队处处为我们打算，为我们讲电影的内容，还画成图画介绍电影，我们都全看懂了。”
    济南山东师范学院丛森来信说，济南市各电影院在“中苏友好月”内，对影片的宣传解释工作作得很好，一般的都能发说明书，介绍影片的内容。为了照顾不识字的观众，在电影放映前还由广播讲解影片内容。但该市各影院在“中苏友好月”结束后，影片的宣传工作又放松了，有的作得很不够，有的完全不作了。丛森说：既然宣传解释工作对观众有很大好处，就应坚持下去。
