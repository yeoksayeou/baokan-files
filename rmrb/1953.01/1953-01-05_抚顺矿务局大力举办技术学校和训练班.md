    Fushun Mining Bureau Vigorously Runs Technical Schools and Training Classes

    [By Our Newspaper] The Fushun Mining Bureau is vigorously running various technical schools and training classes to cultivate technical reserve forces and improve the technical level of its on-the-job employees.

    The formal schools run by the Fushun Mining Bureau include the Fushun Mining Technical School, Health Technical School, Technical Workers' School, Junior Technical School, and Administrative Cadre School. The Mining Technical School has 800 students, with a three-year course. The Technical Workers' School has more than 780 students and plans to expand to 1,200 this year. The Junior Technical School plans to upgrade skilled workers to technicians in two years, currently has more than 180 students, and plans to expand to 500.

    The amateur technical school has one main school and twelve branch schools. The branch schools are located in various factories and mines, with a total of more than 4,500 students. The students are divided into advanced, junior, and preparatory classes according to their cultural and technical levels (some branch schools currently only have junior classes), and four departments of electrical engineering, machinery, chemical engineering, and civil engineering are set up separately. After graduating from the advanced class, students can reach the level of a technician. This year, each school will generally have a class of graduates. The preparatory class recruits workers with a primary school graduation level. Half of the students' book expenses are subsidized by the administration. Most of the teachers are part-time technical personnel.

    The Fushun Mining Bureau frequently runs various short-term training classes. There are currently more than 40 classes in progress, with approximately more than 1,400 students. The mining bureau's directly affiliated drilling training class graduates in half a year; the third term has more than 170 students, and plans to expand to 300. In addition, the mining bureau also runs short-term administrative cadre training classes, Russian classes, etc.

    Signing apprenticeship contracts is an effective way to improve the skills of apprentices in the actual production process. The Fushun Mining Bureau has organized a "Master-Apprentice Contract Committee" by the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Youth League to lead this work. Currently, approximately 200 to 300 apprenticeship contracts can be signed each month. Through signing apprenticeship contracts, general apprentices can be promoted to skilled workers after six months of training and passing the examination. In addition, the Fushun Mining Bureau is also preparing to trial the signing of mutual assistance contracts for skilled workers, in which more advanced skilled workers help lower-level skilled workers improve their technical skills.

    抚顺矿务局大力举办技术学校和训练班
    【本报讯】抚顺矿务局大力举办各种技术学校和训练班，培养技术后备力量，提高在职员工的技术水平。
    抚顺矿务局所举办的正规学校，有抚顺矿山技术学校、卫生技术学校、技工学校、初级技术学校和行政干部学校。矿山技术学校有学生八百人，三年毕业。技工学校有学生七百八十余人，今年拟扩充到一千二百人。初级技术学校准备以二年的时间把技术工人提高为技术员，现有学生一百八十余人，拟扩充到五百人。
    业余技术学校有一个总校、十二个分校，分校设在各厂矿，全校学员共四千五百余人。按参加学习的工人的文化技术水平分编为高级班、初级班和预备班（有的分校目前还只设有初级班），并分别设立电机、机械、化工、土木建筑四个科。学员在高级班毕业后可达到技术员的水平。今年各校普遍有一班学员毕业。预备班吸收具有初小毕业水平的工人参加。学员书籍费由行政方面补助一半。教员多半由技术人员兼任。
    抚顺矿务局经常举办各种各样的短期训练班。现在正举办的有四十余班，学员约一千四百余人。该矿务局直属的钻探训练班，半年毕业；第三期有学员一百七十余人，拟扩大到三百人。此外，该矿各局还举办有行政干部短期训练班、俄文班等。
    签订师徒合同是在实际生产过程中提高徒工技术的有效方式。抚顺矿务局由党委、行政、工会、青年团组织了“师徒合同委员会”，负责领导这一工作。现在每月大约可签订二、三百份师徒合同。通过签订师徒合同，一般徒工经六个月培养，考试及格后即可提升为技工。另外，抚顺矿务局还预备试订技工的互助合同，由较高级的技工帮助较低级的技工提高技术水平。
