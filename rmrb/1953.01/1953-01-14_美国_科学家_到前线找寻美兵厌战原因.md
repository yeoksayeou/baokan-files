    American "Scientists" Seek Reasons for American Soldiers' War-Weariness at the Front
    The war-weariness of the American soldiers in the Korean War is a problem that is causing headaches for the American reactionary ruling group. According to a report from the United Press International from the Korean front, "Four scientists, carrying books and recorders, climbed the rugged frontline hills on Sunday (January 11) to find out why the soldiers are complaining." It is said that these four scientists are "three psychologists and one sociologist" who will "work with the latest psychological testing methods." The American scientists in the service of the government have tried more than once to create "bravery" in the hearts of the soldiers of the American invading army, but they have all failed shamefully. In fact, the reason why American soldiers "lack enthusiasm" when "performing missions" is very clear: they are unwilling to use their lives to exchange the maximum profit for the big bosses on Wall Street.

    美国“科学家”到前线找寻美兵厌战原因
    侵朝美军士兵厌战，这是使美国反动统治集团头疼的问题。据美国合众社自朝鲜前线报道，“四个科学家星期日（一月十一日）背着书本和录音器，爬上崎岖的前线山头，要去找出战士们发牢骚的原因。”据说，这四个科学家是“三个心理学家和一个社会学家”，他们将“用最新的心理测验方法工作”。美国的御用科学家们曾经不止一次地企图在美国侵略军队士兵的心中制造出“勇敢”来，但是都可耻的失败了。其实美国士兵们“执行任务”时“没有热情”的原因是很清楚的，就是他们不愿意用自己的生命替华尔街大老板们换取最大限度的利润。
