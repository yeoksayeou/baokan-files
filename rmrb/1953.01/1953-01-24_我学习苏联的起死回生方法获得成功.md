    I Succeeded in Learning the Soviet Method of Resuscitation
    Huo Luanqiang, Surgeon, Shanghai First People's Hospital

    As a surgeon, the most painful and unpleasant things for me in the past few years have been encountering patients in the emergency room suffering from severe "shock" caused by excessive bleeding (patients with rapid pulse, shallow breathing, low and unstable blood pressure, sometimes with loss of consciousness); or when surgery was in progress, the patient's blood pressure dropped significantly, the heart suddenly stopped beating, and the dying life could not be saved, unable to bring the dead back to life.

    In 1951, when I participated in the first Shanghai medical team for the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I encountered some wounded soldiers with traumatic injuries at the front. Once, I spent eight hours guarding a most beloved volunteer soldier, giving him intravenous blood transfusions, trying to save him from traumatic "shock" caused by excessive bleeding; but in the end, this soldier still sacrificed himself. With tears in my eyes, I closed his eyelids, but my hand did not let go of his still not completely cold hand. I thought: was this soldier's life sacrificed just like that? Could we not find a better way to save this soldier's life? No, I didn't believe it, it was possible to save this soldier's life. Humanity must conquer nature, and must also conquer avoidable death, especially accidental deaths caused by excessive bleeding and heart failure, we should have a way to conquer it!

    This question had been swirling in my mind, because I could never forget the pain of forever parting with volunteer soldiers at the front!

    Later, I read a "Soviet Medicine" magazine and discovered that the Soviet Union had invented "intra-arterial blood transfusion" during the Great Patriotic War; this method could save most cases of apparent death and "shock", could make the heart that had stopped beating active again, and quickly rescue patients from the brink of death, turning them to safety and gaining new life. After reading this report, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights. I longed to gain more knowledge, so I searched through reference books everywhere, determined to apply this valuable medical experience and technology to our beloved motherland. I hoped that this emergency "intra-arterial blood transfusion" could be widely promoted throughout the country, in battlefields, factories, rural areas, and hospitals... saving the lives of the wounded.

    This idea of mine was quickly supported by Professor Ren Tinggui, Director of Surgery at our hospital, and encouraged by Director Li Hao. Soviet scholar Negovsky proved that the heart can still contract and strive to resume beating even after twenty minutes without blood, but the commonly used intravenous blood transfusion requires the blood to pass through the systemic circulation to reach the coronary arteries, which is relatively slow. Therefore, when encountering patients with excessive blood loss, it is often too late to save them. With the current "intra-arterial blood transfusion", blood can quickly reach the coronary arteries within one minute. The heart itself receives sufficient nutrition, and it will start beating again, rescuing life from the edge of death. We were all convinced of this advanced medical experience, but after searching through many books, we couldn't find any diagrams of the equipment for intra-arterial blood transfusion. So I had to design it myself. Without materials, I went to the hospital warehouse to find them, searching through the waste cabinet for rubber tubes, broken blood pressure monitors, broken thermometers, old saline bottles... It took me almost two weeks to prepare the necessary materials. In order to bend the glass tube, I got blisters on my fingers because I had no experience.

    The preliminary intra-arterial blood transfusion equipment was completed, and I asked Professor Ren Tinggui to look at it. He thought it was very suitable, and I was unspeakably happy. The nurses in the operating room were also happy to sterilize the equipment and wrap it up, ready to be used at any time. But for more than a month, we didn't encounter any emergency patients who needed arterial blood transfusion to save them, so we had to disassemble the equipment after sterilization and re-sterilize it again (because the time interval was too long, we were afraid the sterilization was unreliable).

    Three weeks passed again. One day, Dr. Pan Zhi of the emergency room suddenly called me. I heard a short and urgent voice in the telephone receiver: "Quick, quick, Lao Huo, arterial blood transfusion!" I hurriedly rushed to the emergency room, tightly holding the arterial blood transfusion kit. This was a young worker with a complex fracture of his left lower leg. When he was sent to the hospital, his heart had stopped beating for about ten minutes, and his breathing had stopped after arriving at the emergency room. By the time I arrived, the patient's heart had stopped beating for more than a quarter of an hour, so even though we quickly tried "intra-arterial blood transfusion", we couldn't make the patient's heart beat again. My first attempt at intra-arterial blood transfusion was unsuccessful, and I was very frustrated, but I was not discouraged. I just silently held the transfusion device and sent it back to the operating room for re-sterilization, and did not tell anyone about this unfortunate news. I leaned back in my chair feeling infinitely regretful, thinking: this patient came too late, if he had come a few minutes earlier, there would have been a way to save him. That afternoon, Dr. Pan Zhi called again: "Quick, quick, another one is here!" After hanging up the telephone, I rushed to the emergency room. The nurses and staff in the emergency room had the experience from the emergency earlier that morning and had already prepared everything. Dr. Pan Zhi was also giving artificial respiration to the patient whose heart had already stopped beating. This was a worker brother who was accidentally caught in a machine, with simple fractures of both legs and a broken right arm, bleeding very heavily. When he arrived at the hospital, his breathing and heartbeat had both stopped. In about seven minutes, the patient's artery was cut open, and blood was continuously injected into the heart; but this experiment failed again, and the patient's life was never able to be saved.

    On December 6, 1952, a patient named Lin Wenhuan in the surgical ward suddenly had a massive hemorrhage due to a peptic gastric ulcer, and his condition was very critical. The patient had already fallen into a coma, his pulse had stopped beating, and his blood pressure could not be measured. The patient's family was crying in despair beside him. At this time, I and doctors Pan Zhi, Xie Tong, and Chen Tong rushed to the ward and immediately performed intra-arterial blood transfusion for him. After about fifteen minutes, the blood pressure did rise to one hundred and ten millimeters of mercury, and then slowly returned to normal. When everyone felt the patient's pulse and heart beating again, they jumped up with joy. The patient was immediately sent to the operating room for a total gastrectomy. The surgery lasted for two and a half hours, and the blood pressure never changed.

    Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the strong support of the administration, and the unity and cooperation of the staff of all departments of the hospital, the "intra-arterial blood transfusion" experiment was successful! Up to now, we have successively saved five dying patients, making further contributions to protecting the health and lives of the people.

    The application of "intra-arterial blood transfusion" is a new attempt in our country. In the future, I would like to continue to conduct further research and promotion with medical workers in various places.

    我学习苏联的起死回生方法获得成功
    上海市立第一人民医院外科医师　霍銮锵
    作为一个外科医生，几年来使自己最感到痛楚和不愉快的事情，便是在急症室里碰到一些因流血过多而引起严重“休克”（病人脉搏变快、呼吸变浅、血压变低、不安定、有时神志昏迷）的病人；或者当手术进行时，患者的血压显著降低，心脏突然停止跳动，垂危的生命，终于无法抢救，不能使死者回生。
    一九五一年，我参加上海市第一批抗美援朝志愿手术医疗队时，在前方碰到一些外伤性的伤员。有一次，我虽然费了八小时的时间，守护在一个最可爱的志愿军战士身畔，为他作静脉输血，设法挽救他的由于流血过多而引起的外伤性“休克”；但最后这位战士依然牺牲了。我流着泪，阖上了他的眼睑，可是我的手，并没有放开他那还未完全冷却的手。我在想：这个战士的生命，便这么牺牲了吗？难道我们再也找不到更好的方法，来挽救这个战士的生命了吗？不，我不相信，挽救这个战士的生命是可能的。人类要征服自然，一定也要征服可以避免的死亡，尤其是因流血过多，引起心脏衰竭的意外的死亡，我们应该有办法征服它！
    这个问题一直盘旋在我的脑海里，因为我永远不能忘却在前方和志愿军战士永别时的悲痛啊！
    后来，我翻阅一本“苏联医学”杂志，发现了苏联在卫国战争时期就发明了“动脉内输血法”；这个方法能挽救多数假死及“休克”患者，能使已经停止跳动的心脏重新活跃起来，使患者迅速地从濒死状态中脱险转安，获得新生命。读了这篇报告，我兴奋得几夜睡不着觉，我渴望能得到更多的知识，于是便到处翻参考书，下决心要把这一宝贵的医学经验和技术，应用到我们亲爱的祖国来。我希望这个急救用的“动脉内输血法”能在全国各地广泛推行，在战场上，工厂里，农村和医院里……抢救伤者的生命。
    我这个想法很快地得到了本院外科主任任廷桂教授的支持和李颢主任的鼓励。苏联学者涅戈夫斯基证明：心脏在无血的情形下，虽经过二十分钟，仍能收缩活动而争取恢复跳动，但通常所应用的静脉输血，血液必需经过大小循环到达心冠状动脉，速度比较迟缓，所以碰到失血过多的病人，往往不及救治。用现在“动脉内输血法”，血液在一分钟内就能迅速到达心冠状动脉，心脏本身获得了充分营养，它就会重新跳动起来，把生命从死亡的边缘上抢救过来。我们都确信这一先进医学经验，但是翻了很多书籍，却找不到在动脉内输血的器械图解。于是我只好自己亲自动手设计，没有材料，就到本院库房去找，在废物柜里寻找橡皮管、坏了的血压测量器、坏了的体温表、旧的盐水瓶子……这样化了将近两个星期的时间，才把要用的材料准备齐了。为了把玻璃管烧弯，由于没有经验，我的手指还烫起了泡。
    初步的动脉输血器具装置完竣了，我请任廷桂教授看，他认为很合适，我心里真有说不出的高兴。手术室的护士同志们也很乐意地把器械消毒，并包裹起来准备着随时能够应用。可是我们有一个多月没有碰到需要用动脉输血挽救的急诊病人，只得把器具消毒后拆开又重新再消毒（因时间隔得太长，消毒怕不可靠）。
    三个星期又过去了。有一天，急症室的潘治医师忽然打了一个电话给我。我在电话筒里听到了短而急促的声音：“快，快，老霍，动脉输血！”我急忙紧抱着动脉输血包直往急症室奔去。这是一个左下肢复杂性骨折的年轻工人。当他被送来医院时，心脏已停止跳动约十分钟，呼吸是到了急症室后才停止的。当我赶到时，病人的心脏停止跳动已超过一刻钟，因而尽管我们赶快试行“动脉内输血法”，也不能使患者的心脏再重新跳动了。我第一次做动脉内输血没有获得成功，心里很懊丧，但我并不灰心，我只是默默地抱着输血器把它送回手术室去重行消毒，也没有把这个不幸的消息告诉别人。我斜躺在椅子上感到无限惋惜，心想：这个病人来得太晚了些，倘能早来几分钟就有办法救他了。当天下午，潘治医师又来了电话：“快，快，又来了一个！”挂上了电话筒，我就赶往急症室去。急症室的护士和工作人员有了上午的那次急诊经验，早已把什么都准备好了。潘治医生也为那个心脏已经停止跳动的病人作人工呼吸。这是一个工人弟兄，因不慎被卷入机器中，两腿单纯骨折，右臂折断，流血非常多，来院时呼吸心跳均已停止。大约七分钟不到，病人的动脉已被切开，血液不断地向心脏喷射而去；可是这次的实验又失败了，病人的生命始终没有能够挽回。
    一九五二年十二月六日，外科病室有一个叫林文焕的病人，因消化性胃溃疡而突然大量出血，病状非常危急。病人已昏迷过去，脉搏停止跳动、血压也无法测量了，病人家属绝望地在旁边痛哭。这时，我和潘治、谢桐、陈桐医师等一起赶到病房，立刻为他进行动脉内输血。约摸过了十五分钟，血压果然上升到了一百十个毫米水银柱，旋又慢慢地恢复到正常。当大家摸到病人的脉搏、心脏都已重新跳动的时候，都高兴得跳了起来。当时立即把病人送到手术室，为他进行全胃截除术。手术时间足足有二小时半，血压始终没有变化。
    由于党的正确领导和行政方面的大力支持，全院各部门工作人员的团结合作，“动脉内输血法”试验成功了！到现在为止，我们已接连救活了五个濒死的病人，对保障人民的健康和生命，有了更进一步的贡献。
    “动脉内输血法”的运用，在我国是一个新的尝试，今后我愿和各地医学工作者继续作进一步的研究和推广。
