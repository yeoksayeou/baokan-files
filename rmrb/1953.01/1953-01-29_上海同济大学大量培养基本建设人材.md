    Shanghai Tongji University Massively Trains Basic Construction Personnel
    Since the readjustment of departments and faculties, Shanghai Tongji University has become the largest civil engineering and architectural university in the country, training personnel for design and construction in basic construction. The university currently has more than 2,500 students and five departments: Railway and Highway, Water Supply and Sewerage, Structure, Architecture, and Surveying, including eighteen majors and twelve "specializations." The school's campus has more than doubled in size compared to before the readjustment.
    Tongji University's various majors are set up according to the needs of basic construction in the country's large-scale construction, existing conditions, and with reference to advanced Soviet experience. Therefore, the training objectives are clear, and the division of labor is very detailed. For example, "Water Supply and Sewerage" used to be just a course in the Civil Engineering Department, but now it has a "Water Supply and Sewerage" major and a "Water Supply and Sewerage" department; in the vocational school, it is further divided into two "specializations": "Water Supply" and "Sewerage." This enables students to focus on learning a specific business and possess the ability to work independently on a certain type of project.
    In order to effectively carry out the work of massively training national construction personnel, Tongji University actively learns from advanced Soviet experience. When school started in the autumn of last year, it formulated teaching plans for various majors, specifically stipulating the distribution of courses and teaching hours in the entire academic program. Teachers throughout the university have compiled 96 kinds of teaching materials. Teachers in various departments have also scheduled "teaching calendars." Teachers throughout the university have organized 29 teaching research groups and teaching teams. Teachers collectively prepare lessons, research and discuss teaching problems, listen to each other's classes, and improve teaching within the teaching and research groups and teaching teams, greatly leveraging the collective teaching power and completely changing the teachers' past scattered and free lecturing style, so that teaching work is carried out in a planned and organized manner. The Physics Teaching and Research Group also adopted the method of having one teacher first give a trial lecture in a certain class, with other teachers attending the lecture, and after everyone makes suggestions on the content of the teaching material and teaching methods and corrects them, they then lecture in each class. This greatly improved the quality of teaching. For example, it was always difficult for students to fully understand the first law of thermodynamics. After collective research by the Physics Teaching and Research Group, it was explained using the example of the change in internal energy when the state of a liquid changes, and the students easily understood this abstract and difficult concept. The Timber Structure Teaching and Research Group has begun to pay attention to combining lectures with practical work. The lecture notes on timber structure engineering compiled by the Timber Structure Teaching and Research Group have added a lot of practical materials, such as the design of three-hinged arches, high towers, scaffolding, formwork, and various bridge structures. Now the teachers and students of the Timber Structure Teaching and Research Group are designing various roof trusses and floor slab devices and formulating standard drawings for use in current basic construction projects. Other teaching and research groups have also incorporated the materials and specifications of existing domestic construction projects into the lecture notes. The lecture notes compiled by the Surveying Teaching and Research Group use engineering survey drawings from Shanghai and Tianjin as examples.
    Inspired by the enthusiasm for building the motherland, teachers have greatly strengthened their sense of responsibility to students. In classroom lectures, teachers proactively raise questions or draft self-study discussion outlines to help students focus on thinking, discussing, clarifying concepts, and discovering problems; after the lectures, they focus on guiding students' self-study. Each class has a teaching assistant who serves as a self-study instructor, helping students formulate self-study plans and providing specific guidance for students' self-study. Some teachers even go to the students' dormitories to help students study problems. For students who are less proficient and cannot keep up with the class, teachers provide tutoring for them on Sundays. This responsible spirit of teachers to "teach until they understand" greatly encourages the students' enthusiasm for learning. The students also conduct planned and organized studies, universally establishing study groups based on dormitories, and the study groups organize several self-study mutual aid groups, which conduct collective self-study in the classroom from 6:30 pm to 9:00 pm according to the self-study plan. Therefore, the learning effect of the students has generally improved, and most students can understand the content of the courses they have studied. Currently, the teachers and students of Tongji University are holding a series of teaching and learning summary meetings to accumulate experience on how a new type of university can quickly and effectively train a large number of construction personnel.

### 上海同济大学大量培养基本建设人材

    上海同济大学大量培养基本建设人材
    上海同济大学在院系调整以后，已成为全国规模最大的培养基本建设中设计和施工人材的土木建筑工程大学。全校现有学生二千五百多人，设有铁路公路、上下水道、结构、建筑和测量五个系，包括十八个专业和十二个“专门化”。学校的校舍已较调整前扩大一倍多。
    同济大学各种专业，是根据国家大规模建设中基本建设的需要和现有条件并参照苏联先进经验设置的。因此，培养目标明确，分工很细。例如“上下水道”在过去只是土木系中的一门课程，现在设置了“上下水道”专业和“上下水道”系；在专修科中又分为“上水道”、“下水道”两个“专门化”。这样就使学生能集中学习一种专门业务，在某一种工程上具备独立工作的能力。
    为了使大规模培养国家建设人材的工作有效地进行，同济大学积极学习苏联先进经验，在去年秋季开学时就拟订了各种专业的教学计划，具体地规定了全部学程中的课程和教学时数的分配。全校教师编译教材已有九十六种。各系科的教师也都排定了“教学日历”。全校教师共组织了二十九个教学研究组和教学小组。教师们在教研组和教学小组内集体备课，研究和讨论教学问题，相互听课，改进教学，大大发挥了集体教学力量，完全改变了教师们过去散漫的自由讲授的作风，使教学工作在有计划有组织的情况下进行。物理教研组并采用由一位教师先在某一班试讲，其他教师参加听课的办法，经过大家对教材内容、教学方法提出意见加以改正后，才到各班去讲授。这样就大大提高了教学质量。例如讲授热力学第一定律，一向很难使同学完全听懂。经过物理教研组集体研究后，用液体状态变化时内能变化的例子来讲解，学生们便容易了解这个抽象难懂的概念了。木结构教研组已开始注意结合实际工作进行讲授。木结构教研组所编木结构工程讲义中已增加很多实际的材料，如三铰拱、高塔、鹰架、模板、桥梁各种结构的设计。现在木结构教研组的教师正和学生们设计各种屋架和楼板的装置，制定出标准的图样，以供当前基本建设工程采用。其他教研组也把国内现有建筑工程的材料、规格编入讲义。测量教研组编写的讲义都以上海、天津的工程测量图样作为例题。
    在建设祖国的热情激励下，教师们大大加强了对学生负责的精神。教师们在课堂讲授中主动提出问题或拟就自学讨论提纲，帮助学生有重点地思考、讨论、明确概念和发现问题；在讲课以后，并着重辅导学生自学。每班都有助教一人担任自学指导员，帮助学生拟订自学计划，具体指导学生自修。有些教师还到学生寝室去帮助学生研究问题。有些程度较差跟不上班的学生，教师们就在星期日替他们补课。教师们这种“包教包懂”的负责精神，大大鼓舞了学生们的学习热情。学生们也进行了有计划有组织的学习，普遍建立了以寝室为单位的学习小组，学习小组中又组织了若干自学互助组，每晚六时半到九时在教室里按照自学计划进行集体自学。因此，学生们学习效果普遍提高，大部分学生都能了解所学课程的内容。目前，同济大学的教师和学生们正举行一系列的教学和学习的总结会议，为新型的大学如何迅速地有效地培养大量建设人材积累经验。（新华社）
