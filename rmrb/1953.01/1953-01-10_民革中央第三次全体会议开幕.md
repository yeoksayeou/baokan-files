Xinhua News Agency, January 9th—The Third Plenary Session (Enlarged Meeting) of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang opened in Beijing on the 9th. Among those attending the meeting were members of the Central Committee Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Tan Pingshan, Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Li Zhangda, Li Renren, Zhu Xuefan, and conveners of local organizations at all levels Xiong Kewu, Xie Jin, Dan Maoxin, and others. Also present were alternate members of the Central Committee, members of the Unity Committee, responsible cadres from provincial and municipal local organizations, and representatives from grassroots organizations, totaling 230 people. Representatives from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and various democratic parties also attended.

Chairman Li Jishen delivered the opening address. He said: Our meeting is convened at a time when the motherland is beginning large-scale construction, and the participants range from members of the Central Committee to representatives of grassroots organizations, representing a broad spectrum within the Party. This meeting will summarize the work since the Second Plenary Session in the winter of 1950 and discuss the future work guidelines. In particular, we must focus on discussing how to implement the three central tasks of the state in 1953—continuing to strengthen the effort to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, beginning large-scale construction, and convening the National People's Congress. Therefore, this meeting is of great significance. Then, Li Jishen elaborated in detail on the great achievements made in national construction and social reform over the past two years. He said: These great achievements are inseparable from the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the contributions of the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending the motherland and peace, the hard work of the national laboring people in production, and the fraternal and selfless assistance given to us by the great Soviet Union. He said: In the past two years, our Party's organization has been consolidated and developed, and Party members have greatly improved their ideological understanding after undergoing training in various political movements and participating in learning. Many Party members have played an active and exemplary role in their work. However, our Party still has shortcomings, and we must learn the method of criticism and self-criticism, strengthen political and ideological education, and ensure the healthy development of the Party. Li Jishen called on the Party members present to conduct in-depth discussions in order to determine the Party's work guidelines and contribute to the great construction cause of the motherland.

Zhang Bojun, representative of the China Democratic League, Yu Huancheng, representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Wang Shao'ao, representative of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Peng Zemin, representative of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, spoke successively. They unanimously believed that it was entirely appropriate and meaningful for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to hold the Third Plenary Session at the beginning of the country's large-scale construction. They congratulated the RCCK on achieving greater success in its future work. They unanimously pointed out that all democratic parties should further exert their strength, work together under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and do a good job in the country's construction.

Next, Chen Shaoxian, director of the preparatory committee for the meeting, reported on the preparatory process of the meeting.

Finally, He Xiangning, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, spoke. After recalling the situation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's implementation of the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, she said: The great achievements of our country's construction undertakings and the rapid development of production work in the past three years are inseparable from Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the friendly and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers. She urged all Party members to strive to consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and work hard to build a happy and prosperous new China and defend peace in the Far East and the world!
