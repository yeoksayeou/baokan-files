Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: The Central People's Government Administration Council issued an order regarding the promulgation of the "Provisional Organizational Regulations and Staffing Principles for Supervisory Offices in Financial and Economic Organs and State-Owned Financial and Economic Enterprises at the Provincial (City) Level and Above."

In order to consolidate the achievements of the Three-Anti Campaign, continue the struggle against corruption, waste, and especially bureaucracy, and to adapt to the needs of the upcoming large-scale national economic construction, it is necessary to immediately establish supervisory bodies in various financial and economic departments. The "Provisional Organizational Regulations for Supervisory Offices in Financial and Economic Organs and State-Owned Financial and Economic Enterprises at the Provincial (City) Level and Above" are hereby promulgated, and it is hoped that you will supervise your affiliated financial and economic organs and state-owned financial and economic enterprises, with the exception of labor departments and local customs offices, to establish and implement their duties in accordance with these regulations.

The staffing of supervisory offices at all levels should adhere to the principle of streamlining: (1) The allocation of staffing quotas shall be calculated based on full-time cadres: each central ministry shall have three to ten personnel (those previously approved by the Administration Council shall remain unchanged according to the originally approved quota), and its affiliated independent bureaus and divisions shall have two to four personnel; each bureau (division) of the greater administrative regions shall have two to four personnel; each department and bureau of provinces (cities) shall have two to four personnel; and each state-owned financial and economic enterprise shall have two to four personnel. (2) The aforementioned quotas shall be resolved within the original total staffing quota. If the original staffing quota is insufficient, it may be reported to the Central Establishment Committee for approval and implementation. (3) Each level of supervisory office director should be equipped with capable and strong cadres to take charge; supervisory commissioners, supervisors, and secretaries should be selected from among those who are loyal, reliable, have a proper work style, can connect with the masses, have strong working abilities, and have a certain level of political and cultural knowledge, equivalent to the section or division chief level cadres in their respective organs, departments, or units, and should, as far as possible, be equipped with some personnel who understand business technology, in order to effectively carry out supervisory work.
