Party Committees and Trade Unions in East China, Central South, Northwest, and other regions
	Should quickly strengthen leadership over local construction trade unions
	The organization of most construction trade unions across the country is extremely incomplete, and should be strengthened quickly to meet the needs of large-scale construction.

	When the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the First National Construction Trade Union Work Conference on June 11, 1951, it proposed to strengthen construction trade union work. After this policy was determined, only the Northeast and North China Federation of Trade Unions implemented it, gradually strengthening construction trade union work, and ensuring the completion of basic construction tasks. Construction trade unions in other regions have not been improved. Some have incomplete organizational structures; some are formed on an ad-hoc basis when temporary tasks arise; some trade union organizations have just been established and cannot yet function.

	In the East China region, before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, construction trade unions were generally led by local trade unions and were not given importance for a long time. The East China City Workers' Conference in June of last year proposed to strengthen basic construction work and elevated the construction industry to the same status as iron and steel, textiles, etc.; but this was not actually done. Until now, construction trade union organizations at all levels are still very incomplete. Nanjing has not yet established a trade union organization. The East China regional-level construction trade union still has no person in charge. The person in charge sent to Beijing to participate in the Second National Construction Trade Union Work Conference at the end of December last year was temporarily transferred from the Party Committee Research Office and did not understand the situation. The Jinan Construction Trade Union has some experience in promoting advanced experiences, but no one is responsible for summarizing and promoting these advanced experiences. Other regions have automatically promoted these advanced experiences, but it is unclear how well they have been promoted, because the organization is incomplete and the situation cannot be reported. The Shanghai Construction Trade Union dismissed eight or more department-level cadres after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and they have not yet been replaced. Many workers do not know what the trade union does. They say, "The trade union is established, it is time to eat relief rice." In the Central South region, construction trade union organizations at all levels have not been established and improved. The National Construction Trade Union Work Committee had to send people from the labor bureau to attend the Second National Construction Trade Union Work Conference, merely as a formality. The cadres who were sent did not understand any of the circumstances, could not give a report, and held the attitude of listening to the meeting and then conveying it back. The framework of the Northwest regional-level construction trade union organization has not yet been set up. In order to participate in this meeting, a person in charge was temporarily decided upon. The leadership of the important city of Xi'an Construction Trade Union has not been strengthened, and work cannot be carried out.

	The lack of sound construction trade union organizations and the failure to strengthen trade union work in the above-mentioned regions have a direct impact on this year's large-scale construction. The preparatory work for basic construction in these places has not been carried out very well, and currently the focus has to be placed on establishing organizations. The preparation period before the start of construction is very short, which will inevitably affect winter training and a series of preparatory work. This is extremely detrimental to the completion of this year's basic construction tasks.

	The weakness of construction trade union organizations in these regions is mostly due to the fact that local Party committees and trade unions have not truly valued basic construction work. Some emphasize that construction workers are complex and difficult to organize, so for a long time they have been carrying out democratic reforms and have not seized the time to carry out the work of establishing trade union organizations. Although the East China region and the Central South region are later in their work steps compared to the Northeast and North China, they can also establish and consolidate construction trade union organizations through democratic reforms, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, etc. This is what the Southwest region did. Therefore, the trade union organization in the Southwest region is more complete than the East China region and the Central South region, and a bottom-up organizational system has been established. The Northwest Regional Federation of Trade Unions does not provide policy guidance for construction trade union work, nor does it provide manpower support, only allowing the following cadres to explore on their own. Due to the limited capabilities of the following cadres, they cannot figure anything out after exploring. Therefore, cadres lack confidence and cannot play an active role.

	Party committees and trade unions at all levels in East China, Central South, and Northwest should quickly find ways to change the current state, strengthen leadership over construction trade unions, establish and improve the organization of construction trade unions, strengthen their forces, and speed up the completion of preparations for basic construction.

### 华东、中南、西北等地党委和总工会  应迅速加强对当地建筑工会的领导

    华东、中南、西北等地党委和总工会
    应迅速加强对当地建筑工会的领导
    全国各地大多数建筑工会的组织极不健全，应迅速加强起来，以适应大规模建设的需要。
    中华全国总工会于一九五一年六月十一日召开第一次全国建筑工会工作会议时，就提出要加强建筑工会工作。这个方针确定以后，只有东北、华北总工会按此方针执行，逐步加强了建筑工会工作，保证了基本建设任务的完成。其他地区的建筑工会，则还没有健全起来，有的组织机构残缺不全；有的临时任务来了就拉伕充任；有的工会组织刚刚建立起来，还不能发挥作用。
    华东区在“三反”“五反”以前，建筑工会一般由地方工会领导，长期未被重视。去年六月华东城工会议曾提出要加强基本建设工作，并将建筑业提到与钢铁、纺织等同等地位；但实际上并未这样做，直到现在各级建筑工会组织仍十分不健全。南京市则到现在还没有建立工会组织。华东区一级的建筑工会，至今没有负责人，去年十二月底，派来北京参加第二次全国建筑工会工作会议的负责人，是临时从党委研究室调来的，不了解情况。济南市建筑工会在推广先进经验方面，有些经验，但也无人负责总结和推广这些先进经验。其他地区有的自动推广这些先进经验，但是，究竟推广得如何，由于组织不健全，情况也反映不上去。上海市建筑工会经过“三反”“五反”运动撤掉了八个部长以上的干部，至今尚未配备起来。很多工人不知工会是干啥的，他们说：“工会成立了，该吃救济米了。”中南区到现在为止，各级建筑工会组织都没有建立和健全起来。这次全国建筑工会工作委员会召开第二次全国建筑工会工作会议，中南区只好把劳动局的人派来交差。被派来的干部不了解任何情况，不能作汇报，抱着来听一听会，回去传达的态度。西北区一级建筑工会组织的架子还没有搭起来，为了参加这次会，临时才决定了一个负责人。重要城市——西安建筑工会的领导，一直没有加强起来，工作无法开展。
    以上各地因为没有健全建筑工会组织，加强工会工作，所以对今年的大规模建设有直接的影响。这些地方的基本建设准备工作，还没有很好开展起来，而目前又不得不把中心放在建立组织方面，开工以前的准备时期又很短，势必要影响冬训工作和一连串的准备工作。这对今年基本建设任务的完成极为不利。
    这些地区建筑工会组织的薄弱，多半是由于当地党委和总工会没有真正重视基本建设工作。有些强调建筑工人复杂，难于组织起来，以致长久以来都是在搞民主改革，没有抓紧时间进行建立工会组织的工作。华东区和中南区虽然和东北、华北比起来工作步骤要晚一些，但是，也可以通过民主改革、“三反”“五反”运动等，把建筑工会组织建立和巩固起来。西南区就是这样做的，因此，西南区工会组织就比较华东区和中南区健全一些，自下而上的组织系统已经建立。西北区总工会对于建筑工会工作不作方针指示，也不给予人力的支持，只让下面几个干部自己去摸，下面干部由于能力所限，摸来摸去也搞不出什么来。因此，干部信心不足，不能发挥积极作用。
    华东、中南、西北各级党委、工会应迅速设法改变目前的状态，加强对建筑工会的领导，把建筑工会的组织建立和健全起来，充实力量，加快速度完成基本建设的准备工作。
