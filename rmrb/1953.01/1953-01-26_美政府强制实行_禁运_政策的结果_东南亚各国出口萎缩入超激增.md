Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: As a result of the U.S. government's forced implementation of the "embargo" policy and its barbaric plunder through price suppression, the economic situation of Southeast Asian countries further deteriorated last year.

According to figures released by the British colonial government in Singapore on January 11th, Malaya exported just over 900,000 tons of rubber in 1952 (including rubber purchased from Indonesia and other regions for transshipment), a decrease of more than 200,000 tons compared to the 1,155,000 tons exported in 1951. Rubber is Malaya's main export product, traditionally accounting for about 67 percent of Malaya's export trade. Therefore, the reduction in rubber exports and the disastrous drop in rubber prices have seriously impacted Malaya's overall economy. The deterioration of Malaya's economic situation is particularly evident in foreign trade. In 1951, due to the U.S.'s massive purchase and stockpiling of rubber, Malaya's foreign trade had a surplus. However, the situation reversed last year. Excluding December, for which statistics are not available, Malaya's trade deficit from January to November reached US$5.4 million.

Indonesia, whose main export product is also rubber, could not avoid the heavy blow brought about by the "embargo" policy and price cuts. The average price of Indonesian rubber per ton was 1,409 guilders in 1951, but it fell below 1,000 guilders in 1952. According to estimates made last September by foreign affairs writers for the Indonesian newspapers "Merdeka" and "Indonesia Raya", Indonesia has lost more than US$130 million in foreign exchange from rubber exports alone since the implementation of the U.S. government's "embargo" policy.

Under the influence of the "embargo" policy and the decline in export prices, Indonesia's foreign trade went from a surplus of 1.3 billion guilders in 1951 to a deficit of more than 1.5 billion guilders in 1952.

The deterioration of the economy in the Philippines, which is under direct U.S. control, can also be seen from some figures revealed by Agence France-Presse. In the first half of last year, the prices of the Philippines' main export products all fell sharply, and the total export value decreased by 27.2 percent compared to the same period in 1951. On the other hand, the U.S. stepped up its dumping of cotton, industrial products, auto parts, tires, and tobacco products in the Philippines, increasing the total import value by 7.1 percent compared to the same period in 1951. This situation resulted in a trade deficit of 65.51 million pesos in the Philippines in the first half of 1952.

In the second half of last year, the Philippines' export trade continued to decline. According to statistics for September alone, this decline had reduced the total value of Philippine import and export trade by 31 percent compared to September of the previous year. Therefore, the trade deficit became even more severe. Philippine puppet President Quirino recently admitted that if export trade continues to decline, it will subvert the Philippine economy.

The situation in Thailand also illustrates the tragic situation of countries under the cruel plunder of U.S. monopoly capital. To please the U.S. government, the Thai Phibunsongkhram reactionary government not only pursued an "embargo" policy but also signed a long-term rubber agreement with the U.S. government, stipulating that the vast majority of its important export product, rubber, would be sold to the U.S. Therefore, when rubber prices plummeted under U.S. price suppression tactics, Thailand's economy was greatly affected. Large rubber plantations in southern Thailand stopped production, a large number of workers lost their jobs, and Thailand's foreign trade showed an average monthly deficit of more than 200 million baht up to the end of September 1952.

The deterioration of the economic situation in Southeast Asian countries has further lowered the living standards of the people of these countries, and as a result, their opposition to the U.S. "embargo" policy is becoming increasingly widespread and high.

### 美政府强制实行“禁运”政策的结果  东南亚各国出口萎缩入超激增

    美政府强制实行“禁运”政策的结果
    东南亚各国出口萎缩入超激增
    【新华社二十五日讯】由于美国政府强制推行“禁运”政策并以压低价格的办法来进行野蛮的掠夺，东南亚各国去年的经济情况已更加恶化。
    据新加坡英国殖民政府十一日发表的数字，马来亚在一九五二年输出的橡胶（连从印尼和其他地区买来转运出口的在内）共九十万吨多一点，比一九五一年的输出额一百十五万五千余吨少了二十多万吨。橡胶是马来亚的主要输出品，一向占马来亚出口贸易的百分之六十七左右。因此，橡胶输出的减少和胶价的惨跌，不能不严重地打击马来亚的全盘经济。马来亚经济情况的恶化，在对外贸易上表现得特别明显。在一九五一年，由于美国大量搜购囤积橡胶，马来亚的对外贸易是出超的。但是去年的情况就反过来了，除十二月份未统计外，马来亚从一月至十一月入超达五百四十万美元。
    以橡胶为主要输出品的印尼，同样无法避免“禁运”政策和压价所带来的沉重打击。印尼橡胶每吨平均价格在一九五一年是一千四百零九盾，而在一九五二年则降至一千盾以下。据印尼“独立报”和
    “印尼新闻报”外交问题撰述人在去年九月估计，自从实行美国政府的“禁运”政策以来，仅就橡胶出口一项来说，印尼已损失了一亿三千万美元以上的外汇。
    印尼的对外贸易，就在“禁运”政策和输出品跌价的影响下，由一九五一年的出超十三亿盾一变而为一九五二年的入超十五亿盾以上。
    在美国直接控制下的菲律宾经济的恶化情况，也可从法新社透露的一些数字上看出来。在去年上半年，菲律宾主要输出品的价格都大跌，同时出口总值比一九五一年同时期减少了百分之二十七点二。另一方面，美国却加紧向菲律宾倾销棉花、工业品、汽车零件、车胎和烟草产品等，使菲律宾的入口总值比一九五一年同时期增加了百分之七点一。这种情况，使菲律宾在一九五二年上半年入超达六千五百一十万比索。
    去年下半年，菲律宾出口贸易继续下降，仅据去年九月份的统计，由于这种下降，已使菲律宾进出口贸易总额比前年九月份减少了百分之三十一。因此，入超情况更严重了。菲律宾傀儡总统季里诺最近承认：出口贸易如继续下降，将会颠覆菲律宾的经济。
    泰国的情形也同样说明了在美国垄断资本残酷掠夺下的国家的悲惨情况。泰国銮披汶反动政府为讨好美国政府，不但奉行“禁运”政策，而且还和美国政府签订了长期的橡胶协定，规定把它的重要输出品橡胶绝大部分都卖给美国。因此，当橡胶价格在美国压价手段下大跌以后，泰国的经济也就大受影响，泰国南部广大橡胶园停止生产，大批工人失业，一九五二年的对外贸易，截至九月底止，平均每月入超数额都在二亿铢以上。
    东南亚各国的经济情况恶化，已使各国人民的生活水平更加降低，因而他们反对美国的“禁运”政策的情绪也正越来越普遍和高涨。
