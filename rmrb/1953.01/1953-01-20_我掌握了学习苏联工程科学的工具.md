    I Have Mastered the Tools for Learning Soviet Engineering Science
    Chen Qin, Engineer, Railway Engineering Bureau, Ministry of Railways

    In early December of last year, I participated in an intensive course for reading Russian professional books.

    In the past, I studied engineering knowledge from capitalist countries. After liberation, I originally had many opportunities to absorb Soviet experience to enrich my engineering knowledge; however, because I didn't understand Russian, I did very poorly in this regard. This has caused a lot of losses in my work. For example, when revising the summary of "Liujiang Bridge Steel Beam Erection" in March 1951, according to the opinion of Soviet experts, it was necessary to first erect wooden cribbing on the pier to the required height, and then nail three steel rails each in the upstream and downstream directions on the top of the wooden cribbing to form a roller slide. Relying on the rolling of the rollers, the steel beam would move forward along the slide. The two ends of the steel beam slide on the pier were slightly curved downwards to facilitate the insertion and removal of the rollers. As for the correction of the forward direction of the steel beam, it was done by changing the direction of the rollers. This roller combines both movement and rotation when sliding the steel beam forward. The friction is small and the progress is faster. This is indeed a good method. However, because I did not understand Russian, I could not thoroughly understand this advanced experience. At the same time, the Anglo-American engineering knowledge in my mind played a considerable role. Therefore, I not only did not criticize the two reasons proposed by the construction unit in the summary for refusing to use the roller slide, but also expressed my agreement. Their reasons were: First, steel rails and rollers are hard objects, lack adhesion, and the forward speed of the steel beam is very slow, making it very troublesome to insert the rollers. Second, the rollers are placed on the slide, and their two ends are not restricted. When the steel beam moves forward, the rollers roll and move together, and their direction cannot be controlled. If relying on manpower to strike with a sledgehammer to correct it, it would be too troublesome to correct the direction of dozens of rollers, and the beam dragging progress would also be affected. At that time, I thought that changing to the method of using upright rollers and I-beams had only small shortcomings and no major problems. Therefore, the method of upright rollers and I-beams was introduced in the revised summary. Later, when dragging the steel beam of the Tuojiang Bridge, the person in charge of the construction site still wanted to use the method of upright rollers and I-beams, but as a result, the web thickness was not enough and deformation occurred, so the roller slide was replaced again, but the shortened I-beams had already become waste. If I had understood Russian at that time, I could have referred to the Soviet experience, changed the construction method, and avoided this unnecessary loss.

    Based on the lessons learned from past work, I urgently requested to learn Russian, but I was worried that my memory was not good and I would not be able to learn it. I had previously participated in the "Russian Broadcast Lectures," but after studying for more than a month, I went out to work, and when I came back, I couldn't even pronounce all the letters. I thought that it was impossible to climb this language mountain in more than twenty days. Therefore, I had doubts about the intensive Russian learning. But no matter what, I was determined to participate in the learning. After more than twenty days (a total of 200 hours) of study, I have memorized more than 1,300 new words, become familiar with the declension of adjectives and nouns, and the conjugation of verbs, and initially mastered the tool of Russian. When reading "Handbook for Railway Technicians" (Volume 4), I have already achieved a score of reading 600 to 700 words per hour. At this time, my doubts about "Russian is difficult to learn" were completely dispelled.

    Our intensive learning started on December 5th last year and ended on December 27th. Due to objective conditions, although we were completely separated from work, we did not live together in a concentrated manner, but went to the designated place to participate in learning on time, and finished class on time, just like usual work. On Sunday mornings, we concentrated on reviewing for three hours, and took a break in the afternoon as usual. Because everyone had a strong determination to learn, and could concentrate their attention, they all felt relaxed and happy, and did not encounter too much difficulty. This fact shows that as long as you have the determination, Russian can be learned well.

    When we were attacking new words, we adopted the method of collectively finding tricks. At that time, we had to recite more than one hundred new words every day. The instructor would read it once first, and then the groups would find tricks to review together. We used the following methods to memorize new words: First, analyze the roots, for example, "ОдновРеменно," we can understand that the Chinese meaning of this word is "at the same time" as long as we analyze it. Second, discover the connection between words with the same root, for example, from "Ходить - walk" we can associate "Проходить - pass" and "Входить - enter," etc. Third, memorize Russian new words through the foreign language of the new word, for example, "Спечиалист - expert," can be compared with the word in English, and comrades with a little English foundation can immediately remember it when they hear it. Fourth, use "homophony" to memorize new words (that is, use Chinese that is similar in pronunciation to Russian words to memorize), such as "Много - many," as soon as I think of "full of" in the Jiangnan dialect, I immediately remember it. We used the above method to memorize more than 140 new words in three and a half hours without feeling much difficulty.

    After I was able to read Russian professional books, I realized that the Soviet Union not only has its unique advantages in engineering organization, but also in technology, which Anglo-American countries cannot match. For example, when we learned about the "third chord" in the bridge inspection section, everyone felt that this was something we had never seen in Anglo-American books before. One comrade even consulted an old engineer who had studied in Anglo-American countries for many years, and he also said that this is indeed a good way to inspect and strengthen bridges, and he had never seen it in Anglo-American books before. There are many examples like this.

    I understand Russian, and therefore I have the tools to learn Soviet engineering science.

    我掌握了学习苏联工程科学的工具
    中央铁道部铁路工程总局工程师  陈钦
    去年十二月初，我参加了俄文专业书籍阅读速成班的学习。
    过去，我学的是资本主义国家的工程知识。解放以后，我本来有很多机会吸取苏联经验，以丰富自己的工程知识；但因不懂俄文，在这方面做得很差。这曾使工作遭受到不少损失。例如，一九五一年三月间修改“柳江桥钢梁架设”总结时，关于滚轴滑道部分，根据苏联专家的意见，必须先在墩座上搭方木垛至需要高度，再在方木垛顶上，上下游方向各钉钢轨三根，以构成滚轴滑道。靠滚轴的滚动，使钢梁循滑道方向前进，墩座上钢梁滑道的两端略向下方弯曲，以便滚轴的塞进滚出。至于钢梁前进方向的校正，则靠变更滚轴的方向来作。此项滚轴，当滑动钢梁前进时，移动和转动两个动作兼而有之。摩擦力较小，进度较速。这确是一个好办法。但由于我不懂俄文，无法彻底了解此项先进经验。同时，英美的那一套工程知识，在我脑壳中起着相当的作用。因此，对于施工单位在总结中提出的拒绝使用滚轴滑道的两点理由，不仅未加批判，而且表示同意。他们的理由是：第一，钢轨及滚轴都是坚硬的东西，缺乏附着力，且钢梁前进速度甚慢，欲塞进滚轴，非常麻烦。第二，滚轴置于滑道上，其两端不受限制，当钢梁前进时，滚轴随同滚动、移动，其方向无法控制。若赖人力用大锤敲击以校正之，则校正数十个滚轴之方向，将不胜其烦，拖梁进度，亦将受影响。当时我认为：改用仰式滚轮和工字梁的办法，只有小缺点，没有大的问题。于是在修改后的总结中介绍了仰式滚轮和工字梁的办法。后来在拖拉沱江桥钢梁时，工地负责人仍想用仰式滚轮和工字梁的办法，结果因腹板厚度不够，发生变形，乃再换用滚轴滑道，但截短的工字梁，却已成为废料了。假如当时懂得俄文的话，就可以参照苏联经验，改变施工办法，避免这种无谓的损失。
    根据过去工作中的教训，我迫切要求学习俄文，但是我耽心记性不好，学不成。以前我参加过“俄文广播讲座”，但学了一个多月之后便出外去工作了，回来时就连字母也念不全了。我想着，要在二十多天的时间内爬过这座语言大山是不可能的。因此我对俄文速成学习怀着疑虑的心情。可是不管怎样，我还是下决心参加了学习。经过二十多天（共二百小时）的学习，我已经记牢了一千三百多个生词，熟习了形容词、名词等的变格和动词的变位，初步掌握了俄文这个工具。阅读“铁路技术人员手册”
    （第四册）时，并已达到了每小时能阅读六百字到七百字的成绩。这时，我的“俄文难学”的疑虑完全消释了。
    我们的速成学习是于去年十二月五日开始的，十二月二十七日结束。因为客观条件的限制，我们虽然全部脱离了工作，但并没有集中生活在一起，只是按时到规定的地点参加学习，按时下课，和平时工作一样。星期天上午集中温习三小时，下午照样放假休息。因为大家都有坚强的学习决心，注意力都能集中，因此都感到轻松愉快，没有遇到太大的困难。这个事实说明，只要有决心，俄文是可以学好的。
    我们在突击生字时，采用了集体找窍门的办法。当时，每天大约要念一百多个生词，由辅导员先念一遍，然后分组由大家共同找窍门进行复习。我们是采用下面几种方法记忆生词的：第一，分析字根，例如“ОдновРеменно”，我们只要把它分析一下，就可理解到这个字的中文意义是“同时”。第二，发现同根字的联系，例如由“Ходить——走”就可联想到“Проходить——通过”、“Входить——进入”等。第三，通过该生字的外来语来记忆俄文生词，例如“Спечиалист——专家”，可以和英文中单词比较，稍有英文基础的同志，一听就立即可以记得。第四，利用“谐音”来记忆生词（即用中文里和俄文单词发音近似的来记忆），如“Много——多”，一想到江南话里的“满佬佬”我就马上把它记住了。我们曾用上述方法在三个半钟头内，记牢一百四十多个生字，没有感到多大困难。
    在我能够阅读俄文专业书籍以后，我体会到苏联不但在工程组织方面，有其独特优点，就是在技术上，也不是英美所能望其项背的。例如当我们学到桥梁检定部分中的“第三弦杆”时，大家都觉得，这是我们以前在英美书中从没看到过的。有一位同志还特地请教了一位留学英美若干年的老工程师，他也说这确是检定加固桥梁的好办法，过去在英美书中没有看见过。像这种例子是很多的。
    我懂得了俄文，也就有了学习苏联工程科学的工具。
