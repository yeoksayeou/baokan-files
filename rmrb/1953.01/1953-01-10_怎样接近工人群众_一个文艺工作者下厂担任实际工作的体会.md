How to Approach the Working Class
--Experiences of a Literary Worker Working in a Factory

Ai Mingzhi

In September 1949, shortly after the liberation of Shanghai, I went to work at the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's Third Factory and stayed until recently when the organization transferred me out. I lived in this factory for a full three years.

I originally went to experience life as a literary worker, but due to work needs, I quickly became a leading cadre in the factory. Initially, I was the head of the secretary section, and later I also served as acting deputy director.

The question of how to approach the working class is a common problem among literary workers who go to factories. This problem is difficult to solve satisfactorily if it is only considered as a matter of method. One comrade, in order to get closer to the masses when he went to the factory, bought cigarettes even though he didn't smoke, and offered them to the workers whenever he talked to them. He eventually felt depressed because this didn't solve the problem, and the worker comrades didn't establish the close and intimate friendship he had expected. Before I went to the factory, I thought a lot about how to approach the masses, but once I got there, everything I had thought of was useless. Not only did I get close to the masses, but the masses often took the initiative to come to me to discuss things. There is no secret here, just that when I went down, I didn't go as a guest, but immediately participated in practical work. Through work, the workers got to know me and approached me. In fact, there is no one easier to approach than the worker comrades. If we don't stand aside with our hands in our pockets, holding a guest attitude, but wholeheartedly learn from them, serve them, conscientiously and responsibly help them with something, share their joys, and care about their troubles, then it won't take much time or special methods to tear down the wall between us and the worker comrades, and we can establish a good friendship with them.

As for what kind of work to take on in the factory, it can be decided according to each person's conditions; take on whatever you can do. Some comrades believe that after going to the factory, they must work and produce together with the workers, becoming a worker, which causes many concerns. If one's physical strength and other conditions are suitable, it would be great to work with the workers; if one doesn't have such conditions, it doesn't have much impact. The worker comrades don't seem to see the problem so mechanically. The worker comrades didn't distance themselves from me because I didn't participate in their labor. Any practical work can bring us closer to the workers and strengthen our ideological training and Party spirit cultivation. Due to work needs, we have to consider many problems, analyze many problems, and solve many problems. The themes of our works often take shape in practical work. Most of what I have written myself are the problems I have encountered in practical work.

The important thing is that no matter what practical work we take on, we must do it conscientiously. It is not acceptable to just put on a name and muddle through. Especially when worker comrades come to you with something, you must be very conscientious and responsible in offering them ideas and finding solutions, and not be afraid of trouble. If he does something right, encourage him; if he does something wrong, tell him honestly, without being afraid of causing his displeasure, and without being ambiguous or vague. If you are perfunctory with him, he won't come to you again if he has something to do in the future. When I first went to the factory, I met a worker who had always been considered someone who wouldn't say a word even if you pressed him. When I first came into contact with him, I couldn't say three sentences. Once, he came to me because he couldn't afford the tuition and his child couldn't go to school. I ran around several times to find a school that could reduce or waive fees for him. After that, he often took the initiative to chat with me, and even brought up issues like how his wife should handle remittances to discuss with me.

There are generally two situations for taking on practical work in a factory: one is to go deep into the group, participate in the workers' labor and production, become a worker, or serve as a recorder, group leader, etc. in the group. The advantage of this kind of work is that it is specific and in-depth. Comrades who undertake this type of work should try to get some opportunities to participate in some meetings and activities of the workshop or even the factory, so that they can see things more comprehensively. The other situation is to take on leadership work. This kind of work also has many advantages: a wide range of contacts, a more comprehensive view, easy understanding of the scale and complexity of the movement, easy understanding and mastery of policies, and strict training of one's own position and viewpoint. The disadvantage is that it is often not easy to go deep, especially not easy to understand specific people. I was also troubled by this problem at first, feeling that it didn't matter if I had a lot of things to do and was busy when I took on leadership work, but it was a problem that I couldn't go deep. Later, I realized that I should use the leadership method of "grasping one point to promote the whole" to overcome this shortcoming. So, I used this method. I carefully studied the overall situation, and then focused on key workshops and key groups, paying attention to their situations and their activities in a focused manner, and analyzing and studying them. The characters and events in the two larger works I later wrote were obtained through such experiences.

A long time after I went to the factory, I realized that I had a shortcoming in approaching the masses, which was that my contact surface was not wide enough, and I was often limited to the circles of some cadres and activists. It is perfectly right to approach them. But we cannot therefore fail to approach the general workers, and fail to make close friends with them. This approach is wrong from any point of view.

Shanghai, New Year's Eve, 1952.

    怎样接近工人群众
     ——一个文艺工作者下厂担任实际工作的体会
    艾明之
    我在一九四九年九月，上海解放不久，就到上海钢铁公司第三厂工作，直到最近组织将我调出来。整整三年，我都生活在这个厂子里。
    我原是作为文艺工作者下去体验生活的，但由于工作上的需要，很快就转为厂里一个领导干部。开始是当秘书科长，以后又兼代副厂长。
    怎样和工人群众接近的问题，是在下厂的文艺工作者中间普遍存在的问题。这个问题如果仅仅作为方式方法问题来考虑，是很难圆满解决的。有一位同志，下厂时为了要和群众接近，原来不抽烟的，也买了烟，一和工人谈话，就敬支香烟。他终于觉得苦闷了，因为这样不能解决问题，工人同志并没有像他所预期的，和他建立起亲密无间的友谊。我下厂前，对于如何和群众接近的问题，想的很多，但一下厂，我想的一套，全用不到。我不仅和群众接近了，而且群众常常主动地找上来，和我商量事情。这里并没有什么诀窍，只是因为我下去时不是作为一个客人，而是马上参加了实际工作，从工作中，工人认识了我，接近了我。实际上，再没有比工人同志更容易接近了。倘使我们不是袖着手站在一边，抱着作客的态度，而是全心全意向他们学习，为他们服务，认真负责地帮他们做一点事情，与他们共欢乐，关心他们的烦恼，那么，不需要多少时间，也不需要特别方式方法，就能够将我们和工人同志中间的隔墙推倒，就能和他们建立很好的友谊。
    至于在厂里担任什么工作，可根据各人条件决定，能干什么就担任什么。有些同志认为，下厂后必须和工人一起劳动生产，做一个工人，并由此引起许多顾虑。如果体力及其他条件合适的话，能和工人一起劳动，固然再好没有了；倘若不具备这样的条件，也没有多大影响。工人同志好像并不这样机械地看问题，工人同志并不因为我没有参加他们的劳动而对我疏远。任何实际工作，都可以使我们接近工人，可以加强我们的立场锻炼和党性修养。由于工作上的需要，我们不得不考虑许多问题，分析许多问题，解决许多问题。作品的主题常常就在实际工作中形成。我自己所写的，大部分都是在实际工作中所遭遇到的问题。
    重要的是：我们不论担任什么实际工作，一定要认真做好它。挂一个名义，随便敷衍敷衍是不行的。特别是当工人同志有事情来找你的时候，一定要非常认真负责地替他出主意，想办法，不能怕麻烦。如果某一件事，他做对了，就鼓励他；做错了，就老老实实告诉他，不必怕引起他的不快，而模棱两可，含含糊糊。你如果敷衍他，他以后有事，就不会来找你了。我初下厂时，遇到一位工人，他是一向被人认为用扁担也压不出话来的。我最初和他接触时，说不上三句话。有一次他为了负担不起学费，小孩无法上学的事来找我，我为了替他找一个可以减免费用的学校，奔跑了几次。以后他经常自动找我聊天，甚至把老婆怎样处理汇款一类问题都拿来和我商量了。
    下厂担任实际工作，大致有两种情况：一种是深入到小组中，参加工人的劳动生产，做一个工人，或在小组里担任记录员、小组长等等。这种工作的好处是具体深入。担任这一类工作的同志，最好能争取一些机会，参加车间甚至厂部的一些会议和活动，这样可以看得比较全面。另一种情况，是担任领导工作。这种工作也有许多好处，接触面宽，看得比较全面，容易了解运动的规模及其复杂性，容易理解及掌握政策，自己的立场观点也会受到严格的锻炼。缺点在于往往不容易深入，特别是不容易了解具体的人。我当初在这个问题上也苦恼过，觉得担任了领导工作，事情多，工作忙不要紧，深入不下去却是个问题。后来觉察到，应该用“抓住一点，推动全面”的领导方法来克服这个缺点。我就运用了这个方法。我认真研究全般情况，于是，抓住重点车间，重点小组，有重点地注意他们的情况，他们的活动，并加以分析研究。我后来所写的两个篇幅较大的作品的人物和事件，都是通过这样的体验而获得的。
    我下厂很久以后，发觉自己在接近群众方面有一个缺点，这就是接触面不够广，常常局限在一些干部和积极分子的圈子里。和他们接近，这是完全应该的。但不能因此就不接近一般工人，不跟他们做知心朋友。这样做法，无论从哪一方面说，都是不对的。
    一九五二年除夕，上海。
