Title: Design Work for Basic Construction Projects in Beijing is Too Slow

Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: Design work for basic construction projects in Beijing is progressing slowly. To date, the design for more than 90% of the projects has not yet started. Of all the construction projects to be carried out in Beijing this year, less than one-tenth have been confirmed so far. The Beijing Construction Company is undertaking nearly one million square meters of construction tasks this year, but its design department has not received any new engineering designs, apart from some standard design drawings. This greatly affects the completion of this year's basic construction tasks.

The slow progress of basic construction project design work in Beijing is mainly due to the fact that the basic construction plans of the relevant departments were determined too late, creating a passive situation for the entire preparation work of basic construction. Many municipal-level agencies in Beijing initially proposed figures that were too large. After repeated review and prioritization, the construction figures were only preliminarily determined in early January.

Secondly, the failure to determine the architectural form and the construction area has also affected the design work from starting early. Regarding the architectural form, many engineers have their own set of ideas, so there is a lack of unified principles in proposing architectural requirements, engineering design and review. Regarding the construction area, many units have not yet finalized it, so the design department cannot start surveying work.

Unspecific construction requirements and insufficient data are also among the reasons for the delay in design work. Many construction units only provide the design department with an investment figure and construction area, and some necessary data are not available. For example, the Veterinary Bureau of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission only asked the design department to build 3,000 square meters of houses, but did not provide the necessary information such as what kind of houses to build, where to build them, and the unit price of each room. As a result, the design department cannot immediately start designing after receiving the task. On the other hand, some design departments are not actively overcoming the difficulties of lack of data and have a tendency to simply wait for data.

The State Council of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal People's Government have now taken appropriate measures to overcome the shortcomings of slow design in basic construction projects in Beijing: First, all departments are required to attach importance to basic construction work, oppose blindness and rashness, and formulate plans as early as possible based on subjective strength and objective conditions; relevant leading units should also simplify procedures and strive for early review and approval. Second, regarding the issue of architectural form, the design and review should be mainly based on the principles of applicability, solidity, safety, economy, solemnity, and simplicity. Standard drawings should be used for the design and construction of general projects to save manpower and time, and to concentrate the design force on the design of major projects. Third, after the winter training this year, organize forces to carry out the construction of carry-over (1952) projects first, and at the same time vigorously strengthen the various organizational work of construction to prevent the occurrence of idleness.

### 北京基本建设工程设计工作做得太慢

    北京基本建设工程设计工作做得太慢
    【新华社十九日讯】北京基本建设工程的设计工作进展迟缓，到目前为止，百分之九十以上的工程还没有开始设计。今年，在北京要进行的全部建筑工程，至今已经确定的还不到十分之一；北京市建筑公司今年担负将近一百万平方公尺的建设任务，但该公司设计部门除掉一些标准图样的设计外，新的工程设计一项还没有接到。这就大大影响了今年基本建设任务的完成。
    北京基本建设工程设计工作进展迟缓，主要原因是各有关部门的基本建设计划确定得太晚，造成基本建设整个准备工作的被动局面。北京市级许多机关，由于起初提出的数字太大，经过反复的审核和排队，直到一月初旬才把建筑数字初步确定下来。
    其次，建筑形式和建筑地区没有确定，也影响了设计工作不能早日进行。关于建筑形式，很多工程师各有一套主张，因此，在提出建筑要求、工程设计和审核时就缺乏统一的原则。关于建筑地区，到现在为止，还有许多单位没有最后确定，这样，设计部门就无法开始进行勘测工作。
    有关建筑的要求不具体和资料不充分，也是设计工作迟迟不前的原因之一。很多建筑单位，只向设计部门提出一个投资数字和建筑面积，一些必要的资料都不具备，例如中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会兽医局只向设计部门提出要盖三千平方公尺房屋，但是对盖什么样的房子、盖在什么地方、每间的单价多少等项必备的资料都没有，以致设计部门不能在接到任务后立即进行设计。另一方面，某些设计部门不积极地克服资料缺乏的困难，存在着单纯等待资料的偏向。
    中央人民政府政务院和北京市人民政府现已采取妥善办法克服北京基本建设工程中设计迟缓的缺点：一、要求各部门重视基本建设工作，反对盲目和冒进，根据主观力量和客观条件，尽早订出计划；各有关领导单位，也要简化手续，争取早日审核和批准。二、关于建筑形式问题，主要根据适用、坚固安全、经济、庄严朴素的原则进行设计和审查。一般工程均采用标准图样进行设计和施工，以便节省人力和时间，并把设计力量集中到主要的工程设计上面去。三、今年冬训以后，先组织力量进行跨年度（一九五二年）工程的施工，同时大力加强施工的各种组织工作，以防止发生窝工的现象。
