Xinhua News Agency, January 6th—The Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government recently convened the Second National Grain Work Conference in Beijing. Attending the conference were the heads of grain organizations from major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, some key provinces, and provinces and cities in the North China region, as well as representatives from relevant central units, totaling eighty-four people. This conference reviewed the implementation of various resolutions since the First National Grain Work Conference in September 1952 and discussed the guidelines, tasks, and plans for national grain work in 1953, several specific business operations, as well as the organizational structure and cadres of the grain system. Concrete plans were formulated.

    The conference was held from December 16th to 28th, 1952. 章乃器 (Zhang Naiqi), Minister of Food, pointed out in his opening speech that the work of the grain system must be elevated a step further on the eve of the country's large-scale, planned economic construction. He pointed out that if the grain system is to undertake the glorious task of accumulating funds for national construction, it should promote the economic accounting system in grain management. He then explained in detail from the two aspects of "necessity" and "possibility" the conditions for promoting the economic accounting system in the national grain system this year in a step-by-step manner, and criticized the tendencies of the supply system mentality, purely profit-seeking viewpoints, and departmentalism that hindered the promotion of the economic accounting system.

    Attendees unanimously agreed in their speeches that it is entirely necessary to gradually implement the economic accounting system. After repeated discussions, the conference decided that the general requirements for national grain work in 1953 are: on the basis of continuing to stabilize grain prices and ensure supply, correctly formulate and effectively complete purchasing and sales plans, promote the economic accounting system step by step but resolutely, practice strict economy, and ensure the completion and strive to exceed the task of turning over profits.

    Attendees studied documents related to the promotion of the economic accounting system and, after careful research and revision, formulated the "Draft National Grain Circulation Plan for 1953," the "Draft National Grain Enterprise Commodity Circulation Fee Plan for 1953," and several specific draft plans adapted to them. The conference believes that the grain work tasks in 1953 are very arduous, but based on the actual performance of grain purchasing and sales in 1952, the annual increase in grain production, the continuous increase in unit area yield in economic crop areas, the increase in the population of cities and industrial and mining areas, the significant increase in the purchasing power of the working people, and the fact that national grain work has been unified and institutions have been established, this year's national grain work plan can be completed. The conference pointed out that the key to completing the plan lies in: changing the past supply system management thinking that did not consider profits and losses, overcoming conservative tendencies, and earnestly implementing the economic accounting system; practicing strict economy and reducing the level of grain commodity circulation expenses from 22.4% of the total sales amount in 1952 to 18.91%, obtaining reasonable profits entirely from cost savings, rather than focusing on prices.

    The conference also discussed the working methods for promoting the economic accounting system and ensuring the completion of the plan. It was proposed that the determining factor lies in mobilizing the masses. The specific approach is to: closely cooperate with urban and rural cooperatives, unite legitimate private enterprises, pay constant attention to the needs of the people, and ensure the completion of purchase and sale targets; correctly grasp price policies; strengthen the planning of grain circulation, overcome chaotic phenomena such as backflow, cross-transportation, opposite transportation, and roundabout transportation, in order to accelerate turnover and reduce costs; closely combine top and bottom, starting from policy principles and overall interests; and, on the existing basis, earnestly lead and vigorously promote the labor emulation movement, carry out rationalization proposals, and consolidate and enhance the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees in the grain system.

    The conference also discussed basic construction, warehousing and storage, transportation, processing, and other business operations of the national grain system in 1953, and formulated specific plans. The conference also discussed the organizational structure at all levels and cadre training plans based on the basic situation of the heavy tasks of national grain work in 1953.

    Minister 章乃器 (Zhang Naiqi) gave a summary report at the conference. Finally, Deputy Minister 陈希云 (Chen Xiyun) of the Ministry of Food gave the closing speech. He particularly emphasized the importance of strengthening political and ideological leadership in completing the plan. He emphasized the need to strengthen the policy and business learning of grain workers and carry out publicity and education work in order to further improve the quality of work.

    粮食部召开全国粮食工作会议
    决定推行经济核算制为国家建设积累资金
    【新华社六日讯】中央人民政府粮食部最近在北京召开了第二次全国粮食工作会议。出席会议的有各大行政区、内蒙古自治区、一部分重点省和华北区各省、市粮食机构的负责人，及中央各有关单位代表共八十四人。这次会议检查了自一九五二年九月第一次全国粮食工作会议以来各项决议的执行情况，并就一九五三年全国粮食工作的方针、任务和计划，几项具体业务工作以及粮食系统的机构、干部等问题，进行了讨论，并制订了具体的方案。
    会议在一九五二年十二月十六日到二十八日举行。粮食部部长章乃器在开幕词中指出：国家在大规模的、有计划的经济建设前夕，粮食系统的工作必须提高一步。他指出粮食系统要担负起为国家建设积累资金的光荣任务，就应该在粮食经营上推行经济核算制。他接着从“必需”和“可能”两方面，详尽地说明了今年在全国粮食系统内，有步骤地推行经济核算制的条件，并对阻碍经济核算制推行的供给制思想、单纯营利观点和本位主义等偏向，作了批判。
    到会人员在发言中，一致认为逐步实行经济核算制，是完全必要的。经过反复讨论，会议决定一九五三年全国粮食工作的总要求是：在继续稳定粮价、保证供给的基础上，正确制订并确实完成购销计划，有步骤地但必须坚决地推行经济核算制，厉行节约，保证完成并力争超过上缴利润的任务。
    到会人员学习了有关推行经济核算制的文件，并经过细致研究修正后，制订了“一九五三年国家粮食流转计划草案”“一九五三年国家粮食企业商品流转费计划草案”及与之相适应的若干具体计划草案。会议认为：一九五三年的粮食工作任务是很繁重的，但根据一九五二年粮食购销业务实绩、粮食逐年增产、经济作物地区单位面积产量不断提高、城市和工矿区人口增加、劳动人民购买力显著增加、而全国粮食工作已经统一、机构亦已铺开等情况，今年的国家粮食工作计划是可以完成的。会议指出完成计划的关键在于：改变过去不计盈亏的供给制经营思想，克服保守主义倾向，切实贯彻经济核算制；厉行节约，把粮食商品流转费用的水平，由一九五二年占全部卖钱额的百分之二十二点四，降为百分之十八点九一，完全从费用节约中取得合理的利润，而不是在价格上打主意。
    会议也对推行经济核算制、保证计划完成的工作方法，进行了讨论。提出决定因素在于发动群众。具体做法是：密切配合城乡合作社，团结正当的私营企业，经常注意人民的需求，保证完成收销计划指标；正确掌握价格政策；加强粮食流转的计划性，克服倒流、交叉运输、相向运输、迂回运输等混乱现象，以加速周转，减低成本；上下彼此间密切结合，从政策原则和整体利益出发；并在既有基础上，认真领导和大力推进劳动竞赛运动，开展合理化建议，巩固与提高粮食系统广大职工的积极性和创造性。
    会议又讨论了一九五三年全国粮食系统的基本建设、仓储保管、调运、加工等项业务，并制订了具体方案。会议还依据一九五三年国家粮食工作任务重大的基本情况，讨论了各级组织机构和干部培养计划。
    会议由章乃器部长作了总结报告。最后由粮食部陈希云副部长致闭幕词。他特别强调了在完成计划中，加强政治思想领导的重要性。他强调必须加强粮食工作人员的政策和业务学习，开展宣传教育工作，以进一步提高工作质量。
