The state's large-scale planned economic construction is about to begin. Without a relatively sound and systematic statistical organization and a relatively complete scientific statistical system, it is impossible to formulate correct plans and to check the implementation of the plans in a timely manner. To this end, we must strengthen the statistical organizations and statistical work of governments at all levels and various business departments, and we must uniformly formulate a national statistical system and statistical methods, so that our statistical work can adapt to the needs of large-scale economic construction and gradually play a supervisory role in economic construction.

Recently, major administrative regions, provincial and municipal people's governments, and several business departments have begun to establish statistical organizations, equip and train a certain number of statistical cadres, and conduct some preliminary surveys and statistical work in order to adapt to the needs of their work. This is helpful to the country's management, construction, and planning work. However, the development of various regions and departments is uneven. Except for the Northeast, where statistical work has a preliminary foundation due to the early start of economic construction, other regions are generally still in the initial stages. Some departments' leadership still does not have sufficient understanding of the role and importance of statistical work, and lack strong leadership over statistical work, which greatly affects the development of statistical work. Because our statistical institutions are not yet sound and the statistical system has not yet been established, various regions and departments conduct their own surveys and statistics, lacking unified and centralized leadership, and there are still relatively serious phenomena of duplication and confusion in the work. In order to solve the above problems, the Central People's Government has decided to establish the State Statistical Bureau. People's governments at all levels and various business departments should, according to their needs, strengthen statistical organizations and strengthen statistical work; and establish a strict and systematic scientific statistical system in accordance with the unified regulations of the State Statistical Bureau. For this purpose, the following decisions are made:

(1) The State Statistical Bureau is the leading agency for national statistical work. All basic statistical work on finance, economy, culture, education, health, and social conditions shall be led by the State Statistical Bureau. All statistical systems, statistical methods, and statistical forms, etc., promulgated by the State Statistical Bureau (of which particularly important parts shall be approved by the State Planning Commission), must be complied with by all levels of local governments, central and local business departments, and public and private enterprises. Those who issue statistical forms without approval or fail to submit reports as required shall be regarded as violations of discipline and shall be corrected. As for those who falsely report figures or statistical data, it is an act of disloyalty to the state and shall be severely punished.

(2) The statistical institutions of the major administrative regions, provinces, municipalities, special districts, and county people's governments must conduct their work in accordance with the statistical system and work tasks stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau, and are responsible for organizing, guiding, inspecting, and supervising the statistical work of various departments in their respective regions. The statistical institutions of local governments at all levels, in addition to ensuring the completion of the tasks stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau, may conduct local surveys and statistical work as needed, and with the consent of the higher-level statistical institutions.

(3) In order to ensure that the statistical work system and work plan stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau can be implemented, people's governments at all levels in major administrative regions, provinces, municipalities, special districts, and counties must quickly establish and strengthen statistical institutions. Statistical bureaus should be established in major administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities, and statistical sections should be established in special districts and counties, to become part of the major administrative regions, provinces, municipalities, special districts, and county people's governments (those with financial and economic committees are subject to the guidance of the financial and economic committees). In the first quarter of 1953, statistical institutions above the provincial and municipal levels must be established and strengthened, and statistical institutions above the county level must be established in order to complete the tasks stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau and undertake the necessary local survey and statistical work.

(4) The various business departments of people's governments at all levels must abide by the instructions and regulations on statistics promulgated by the State Statistical Bureau, and shall submit reports to the statistical institutions of the people's government at the same level on time in accordance with the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau. In addition to the reports stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau, the business departments of the Central People's Government and local governments at all levels may issue various supplementary reports after obtaining the consent of the State Statistical Bureau or the statistical organs at the same level according to their business needs. To this end, all business departments should immediately strengthen their existing statistical institutions and equip them with the necessary number of statistical cadres, especially the statistical institutions and statistical cadres at the grassroots level, so as to complete the statistical tasks in a timely manner according to national needs.

(5) The State Statistical Bureau is responsible for quickly improving and supplementing the basic statistical reports applicable to people's governments and business departments at all levels, which shall be filled out and reported by statistical institutions at all levels in a timely manner in accordance with regulations. The State Statistical Bureau should also clean up, study, and review the existing statistical forms to overcome the phenomena of duplication and confusion.

(6) Transferring and training statistical cadres is one of the important keys to strengthening statistical institutions at present. The central business departments and governments above the provincial and municipal levels must quickly equip the necessary cadres to strengthen statistical institutions, and formulate plans for training statistical cadres, and firmly grasp the implementation; specialize statistical workers, and ensure the political purity of statistical workers.

(7) In order to maintain state secrets, statistical institutions at all levels should set up confidential departments or confidential personnel, and all statistical workers must strictly keep state secrets.

    中央人民政府政务院关于充实统计机构加强统计工作的决定
    （一九五三年一月八日政务院命令发布）
    国家大规模的有计划的经济建设即将开始，没有比较健全的系统的统计机构和比较完整的科学的统计制度，就不可能制订正确的计划，不可能及时检查计划的执行情况。为此，必须加强各级政府及各业务部门的统计机构和统计工作，并须统一制定全国性的统计制度和统计方法，使我们的统计工作能适应大规模经济建设的需要，逐步发挥统计工作在经济建设中的监督作用。
    最近各大行政区与省市人民政府及若干业务部门为着适应工作的需要，已在开始建立统计机构，配备与培养了一定数量的统计干部，作了一些初步的调查统计工作，这对于国家的管理工作、建设工作、计划工作是有帮助的。但各地区各部门的发展情况是不平衡的，除东北因经济建设开始较早，统计工作有了初步基础外，其它地区一般还在初创阶段。有些部门领导上对统计工作的作用及其重要性仍认识不足，对统计工作缺乏有力领导，因而大大地影响了统计工作的开展。由于我们的统计机构还不健全，统计制度还未建立，因而各地区、各部门各自调查统计，缺乏统一的集中的领导，工作中尚存在着比较严重的重复混乱现象。为了解决上述问题，中央人民政府已决定成立国家统计局，各级人民政府及各业务部门均应按照需要，充实统计机构，加强统计工作；并按照国家统计局的统一规定，建立严格的、系统的科学统计制度。为此特作决定如下：
    （一）国家统计局为国家统计工作的领导机关，所有财政、经济、文化、教育、卫生及社会情况等基本统计工作，均由国家统计局负责领导。凡国家统计局所颁布的一切统计制度、统计方法、统计表式等（其中特别重要部分应经国家计划委员会批准），所有各级地方政府、中央及地方各业务部门及各公私企业必须遵照执行。如有不经批准乱发统计表格，不按规定填送报表者，得视为违反纪律行为，应予纠正。至于假报数字或谎报统计资料者，则为对国家不忠实的行为，应予严厉的处分。
    （二）各大行政区、省、市、专署及县人民政府的统计机构，均须依据国家统计局所规定的统计制度及工作任务进行工作，并负有对本地区各部门的统计工作进行组织指导、检查督促的责任。各级地方政府的统计机构，除保证完成国家统计局所规定的任务外，得视地方需要，并征得上级统计机构同意后，进行地方性的调查统计工作。
    （三）为使国家统计局所规定的统计工作制度和工作计划得以贯彻执行，大行政区、省、市、专署、县各级人民政府必须迅速建立并加强统计机构，大行政区及省市成立统计局，专署、县成立统计科，成为大行政区、省、市、专署及县人民政府的组成部分（有财经委员会者，受财经委员会指导）。一九五三年第一季内，必须把省、市以上统计机构建立并充实起来，并建立县以上的统计机构，以便完成国家统计局所规定的任务，和担负起地方性的必要的调查统计工作。
    （四）各级人民政府的各业务部门均须遵守国家统计局颁布的有关统计方面的指示和规定，并应按照国家统计局的规定，向同级人民政府的统计机构按期填送报表。除国家统计局所规定的报表外，中央人民政府及各级地方政府的业务部门并得按其业务需要，在取得国家统计局或同级统计机关的同意后，颁发各种补充报表。为此，各业务部门应即加强现有统计机构，配备必要数量的统计干部，特别是基层单位的统计机构与统计干部，俾能按照国家需要及时完成统计任务。
    （五）责成国家统计局迅速改进和补充制定适用于各级人民政府、各业务部门的基本统计报表，由各级统计机构按照规定及时填报。国家统计局并应对现行的各种统计表格加以清理研究与审定，以克服重复混乱现象。
    （六）调配及培养统计干部是目前加强统计机构的重要关键之一，中央各业务部门与各省市以上政府，必须迅速配备必要的干部充实统计机构，并订出培养统计干部的计划，抓紧进行；使统计工作人员专业化，保证统计工作人员政治上的纯洁性。
    （七）为保守国家机密，各级统计机构应设机要部门或机要人员，所有统计工作人员必须严格保守国家机密。
