    Commemorating Stanislavski
    Mei Lanfang
    I first met Stanislavski in 1935 when I performed in the Soviet Union for the first time. He was already in his seventies at that time. From our first meeting, I was attracted by his sincere and humble attitude and the demeanor of a highly accomplished artist. We had several conversations, exchanging the joys and sorrows, gains and losses, that we had personally experienced in art.
    During my performances in Moscow, he often attended my shows, and I also went to the Moscow Art Theatre to watch the plays he directed. He very politely asked me for my criticism.
    He consistently advocated realistic performance and opposed formalism that deviated from life. He highly valued the excellent heritage of Soviet national forms and was also good at absorbing the advantages of foreign art.
    He believed that educating the next generation was the most important task and demonstrated his concern for the younger generation through practical actions. During my second visit to the Soviet Union, his students told me that until the moment before his death, he was still carefully discussing artistic issues with his students. This spirit of dedication and relentless pursuit of art is truly a good example for us to learn from.
    He said that to become a good actor or director, one must diligently study both theory and technique, and neither should be neglected. At the same time, an actor must constantly enrich himself by accepting the test of the masses through stage performances; otherwise, he is like a withered tree without roots.
    Stanislavski's inspiration and encouragement to me are deeply imprinted in my mind. After returning to China, I often thought of his great creations in art and his spirit of relentless pursuit.
    Seventeen years have passed. At the end of 1952, I participated in the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna. On the way back to China, the Chinese delegation was warmly and cordially received by the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in Moscow. On January 7th, I visited the Stanislavski Museum, which deepened my impression of this great artist.
    The comrade in charge of the museum was Stanislavski's secretary. He first led us to the old gentleman's former bedroom. The furnishings and arrangement were the same as they were fourteen years ago, very simple. At the door of the room was a small desk, a prop used by the old gentleman when he performed Shakespeare's plays at the age of twenty-eight, which was later placed in the bedroom for daily use. There was also a suitcase for carrying props during performances. Facing the window was a fireplace, next to which was a square mud stove. The old gentleman built this mud stove to save fuel. The secretary pointed to a single wooden bed lying horizontally against the wall and said, "The old gentleman passed away on this bed." Hearing this, I lowered my head and, looking at the bed, I felt my eyes moisten.
    We then went to an exhibition room where props used by the old gentleman in his early performances of Shakespeare's plays were displayed, including a full set of steel armor. His stage photos, all from the same period of performances, were hanging on the wall. A stage photo in another room was very attractive. He played a character in Gorky's "The Lower Depths," climbing on the attic, with one foot raised behind him, and a hole in the sole of his leather shoe, revealing his toes.
    "Woe from Wit," also known as "Misfortune from Intelligence," is a famous work by the Russian writer Griboyedov. Stanislavski once played the slave owner in this play. Three stage photos were hanging on the wall, with three completely different appearances. It is said that the first photo was the appearance of a general actor, the second was his creative adaptation, which we felt was much more satirical than the first. The image in the third photo was even more deeply portrayed, and one would feel a sense of hatred towards this character in the play at a glance. From this, we can see that Stanislavski portrayed the character of the slave owner with a high degree of hatred, and at the same time, we can also see how deep his love and sympathy were for the enslaved peasants.
    In another exhibition room, many documents were displayed, including a letter of apology from him to all staff members (because he was late once). There was also a letter of self-criticism from him, because he once forgot his lines on stage during a performance, causing a two-minute cold spell. From these documents, we can see the serious work attitude and self-critical spirit of this great artist.
    A precious document was the original manuscript of a play written by Chekhov, with Stanislavski's handwritten deletions. It is said that there were some disputes at the time, and the old gentleman said that everyone must observe discipline and that he had the right to handle this matter.
    In a glass cabinet, there was a photo of Stanislavski with his beard shaved, next to a letter of apology to his wife. It is said that it was customary for Russian men to have well-groomed beards. In the letter, he said, "The beard belongs to you, but now I have to shave it off because I have to play a certain role. Please forgive me." From this letter, we can also see the old gentleman's sense of humor.
    At this time, the museum secretary introduced two hosts, Stanislavski's son and daughter. We recounted our past friendship with each other, and they kindly invited us to their father's former study. I gave the museum a copy of my book "Forty Years of Stage Life" as a memento and wrote a few words on a piece of paper in memory of the old gentleman. They took out a book, facial mask models, and clay opera figures that I had given to the old gentleman in Moscow in the past from the bookcase, asking me to explain them to them; they also specially picked out a clay figure that his father loved most, and showed it to us.
    One room was filled with stage photos of Stanislavski's wife, who was also a famous actress in the past. There was a family reunion photo, with two small children who are now the two middle-aged people standing in front of us.
    We finally walked to the living room, where there was a small stage, with three chairs placed against the wall. I said that this room looked familiar, as if I had been here before. Stanislavski's family took out a photo of me and the old gentleman in this room, with the date written by the old gentleman himself at the bottom, which was March 30, 1935. I was sitting in a high-backed chair, and the old gentleman was sitting in the chair on the right. They solemnly presented me with this precious photo, and I asked them both to sign it as a souvenir. The museum secretary also took out a photo, which was a panoramic view of this room. It was magnificent and exquisite, different from what it is now. It is said that after the old gentleman moved in, he said, "Such a magnificent living room is of no use to me," so he turned it into a small theater. During performances, he also personally pulled the curtains and took care of the venue. This house, which is more than a hundred years old, was given to Stanislavski by the Soviet government.
    On my first day in Moscow this time, the famous director Komisarjevsky told me that Stanislavski mentioned my name to the actors and students when directing his last play. Hearing these words, I felt both ashamed and greatly encouraged. Last autumn, I reread Stanislavski's famous works "My Life in Art" and "An Actor Prepares," and gained a further understanding of his "system." In the future, I will study even more deeply from this great artist.

    纪念史坦尼斯拉夫斯基
    梅兰芳
    一九三五年我第一次到苏联表演的时候，见到史坦尼斯拉夫斯基。那时候，他已经七十多岁了。我初次和他见面，就被他的诚恳谦和的态度和修养精湛的艺术家的风度所吸引。我们有过好几次谈话，交换彼此在艺术上亲身体验出来的甘苦得失。
    我在莫斯科演出期间，他常听我的戏，同时我也到莫斯科艺术剧院观摩他导演的戏，他很客气地请我批评。
    他一贯主张现实主义的表演，反对脱离生活的形式主义。他非常重视苏联民族形式的优良遗产，同时也善于吸取外来艺术的优点。
    他认为教育下一代是最重要的任务，并以实际行动表现了关怀后进的精神。我第二次到苏联时，他的学生告诉我说，直到他临终前一刻，还在和他的学生们仔细地谈着艺术上的问题。这种鞠躬尽瘁、钻研艺术的精神，真是我们学习的好榜样。
    他说要成为一个好演员或好导演，必须刻苦地钻研理论和技术，这二者是不可偏废的。同时一个演员必须不断地通过舞台演出，接受群众考验，这样才能丰富自己；否则就等于无根的枯树了。
    史坦尼斯拉夫斯基对我的启发和鼓励，深深地印在我的脑子里。回国之后，我时时想起他在艺术上的伟大创造，和他的刻苦钻研的精神。
    十七年过去了。一九五二年的岁尾，我参加了在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会。中国代表团在归国途中经过莫斯科，受到苏联对外文化协会热烈亲切的招待。一月七日，我参观了史坦尼斯拉夫斯基博物馆，这使我对这位伟大的艺术家的印象更深刻了。
    博物馆的负责同志是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的秘书。他首先把我们引到老先生生前的卧室，房内陈设位置与十四年前是一样，非常朴素。房门口有一个小书桌，是老先生二十八岁时表演莎士比亚的戏中所用的道具，后来就摆在卧室里日常应用。还有一只手提箱，是演戏时装道具的。对着窗户，有一座壁炉，旁边又砌了一座方形的泥炉。老先生当年为了节省燃料，另外砌了这座泥炉。秘书指着靠墙横摆着的一张单人木床说：“老先生就是在这张床上逝世的”。听到这里，我低下头，对着这张床，我觉得眼眶里湿润了。
    我们又到了一间陈列室，这里陈列着老先生早年表演莎士比亚的戏所用的道具，其中有全身披挂的钢制甲胄。墙上挂着他的剧照，都是同一时期所演的戏。挂在另一个房间里的一张剧照是非常吸引人的。他扮演高尔基的“夜店”中的一个角色，爬在阁楼上，后面一只脚跷起，皮鞋底有一个洞，露出里面的脚趾。
    “智慧的悲哀”又名“聪明误”，是俄国作家葛里鲍耶多夫的名著。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基曾表演这个戏里的奴隶主。墙上挂着三张剧照，三个扮相是截然不同的，据说第一帧是一般的演员的扮相，第二帧是经过他创造改扮的，我们觉得比第一帧的讽刺性要浓得多。第三帧的形象，刻划更深，一看就会对这个剧中人发生憎恨的情感。从这里我们就可以看出史坦尼斯拉夫斯基对于奴隶主这个人物，是以高度的憎恨情绪来刻画的，同时也可以看出他对于被奴役的农民，是怀着多么深厚的热爱和同情。
    在另一个陈列室里，陈列着许多文件，其中有一封是他向全体工作人员道歉的信（因为有一次，他到场晚了）。还有一封是他自我检讨的信，因为他有一次演戏，在台上忘了台词，冷场两分钟。从这些文件里，可以看出这位伟大艺术家的严肃的工作态度和自我批评的精神。
    有一个珍贵的文献是契珂夫所写剧本的原稿，上面经过史坦尼斯拉夫斯基亲笔删节的。据说当时曾有过一些争执，老先生说大家要守纪律，他有权处理这件事。
    在一个玻璃柜里，陈列着一张史坦尼斯拉夫斯基剃了胡子的照片，旁边放着一封他向他夫人道歉的信。据说当年俄国男子有必须修饰美髯的风气。他在信里这样说：“胡子是属于你的，但是我现在因为要扮演某一个角色，不得不剃去胡子，请你原谅。”从这封信里，也可以看出老先生的风趣。
    这时候，博物馆的秘书引进两位主人，是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的儿子和女儿。我们彼此叙说了当年的交谊，他们很亲切地邀我们到他父亲生前起坐的书房里。我把我写的“舞台生活四十年”送给馆内一本留作纪念，还在一张纸上写了几句追念老先生的话。他们从书柜内取出当年我在莫斯科送给老先生的一本书、脸谱模型和戏装泥人，要我解释给他们听；又特别挑出一个他父亲生前最喜爱的泥人，拿给我们看。
    有一间房子里，都是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基夫人的剧照，她过去也是一个名演员。有一张合家欢聚的照片，上面两个小孩子，就是现在站在我们面前的两位中年人。
    我们最后走到客厅，这里有一个小戏台，靠墙放着三把椅子。我说这间房很眼熟，从前我好像到这里来过。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的家属拿出一张我和老先生在这间房里合照的照片，下面有老先生亲笔记载的年月日，是一九三五年三月三十日。我坐在一张高背椅子上，老先生坐在右手的椅子上。他们把这张珍贵的照片，很郑重地赠送给我，我请他们两位签了字，留作纪念。博物馆的秘书又拿出一张照片，是这间房子的全景。华丽精致，与现在的不同。据说老先生住进来以后，曾说：“这样一间华丽的客厅对我没有什么用处”，他就把它改成小型的剧场。演出的时候，他还亲自拉幕、照料场子。这所房子，有一百年以上的历史，是苏联政府赠给史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的。
    我这次到莫斯科的第一天，名导演柯米沙日卫斯基告诉我说，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基在导演最后一个戏的时候，还对演员和学生们提起我的名字。我听到了这几句话，既惭愧，又感到莫大的鼓舞。去年秋间，我曾重读史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的名著“我的艺术生活”和“演员自我修养”，对他的“体系”有了进一步的了解，今后我要更深入地向这位伟大的艺术家学习。
