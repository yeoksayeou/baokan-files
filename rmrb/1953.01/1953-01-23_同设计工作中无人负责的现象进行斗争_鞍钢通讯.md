    Fighting the Phenomenon of Unaccountability in Design Work
    ——Anshan Steel Communication
    Angang
    The design departments of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction are where the most technical personnel are concentrated. Some of these people were transferred from production, and some were assigned from schools. They have done a lot of work for the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel.
    However, before May of last year, a rather serious situation occurred in the design work undertaken by these technical personnel, namely, the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the design work. It had various manifestations.
    Some technical personnel have production and design experience. However, they have very strong conservative ideas. They each use the technology of England, America, Germany, and Japan that they admire as capital. One says British specifications are good, another says American standards are high, and they compete to copy German and Japanese drawings as their own design capital. They blindly believe in and rely on German and Japanese design materials, which are full of errors, and do not do verification work. They are not united with each other, and technically block each other, keeping secrets, and even engaging in factional disputes. In work, they push back and forth and are irresponsible. Those responsible for reviewing drawings rely on those responsible for design, and those responsible for design rely on the reviewers. You rely on me, and I rely on you, and as a result, no one relies on anyone, but all rely on the draftsmen: it is drawn as it is, and no one cares. A drawing goes through several procedures, but no one signs for it. Some engineers responsible for reviewing drawings do not handle the drawings sent to them in a timely manner. When dozens of sheets pile up on the desk, they only take one or two sheets to look at, and then casually sign dozens of sheets of drawings and issue them to get it over with. Some engineers irresponsibly write a small line on the old drawings: "This drawing has not been checked and is for reference only." Sometimes the draftsmen are careless and often miss this line of small print. As a result, the old drawings are substituted for the new ones.
    There are also some people who have not done design work in the past, or have done it, but are not yet familiar with the work, and do not know what to do in many things, and therefore have not been able to take on the responsibility well. Their biggest problem is that they view the design work in isolation, thinking that the design work is just sitting in a room and drawing pictures. They do not conduct investigation and research on the actual situation, but instead engage in a subjective set of things. They do not understand that design is a document that determines the fate of capital construction, and is a work with serious responsibility to the people. Some people even look down on design work, so they are sloppy and careless in their work, resulting in a phenomenon of no one being responsible.
    Because criticism and self-criticism have not been carried out among the technical personnel, this situation has continued to exist and has had a very bad influence on the newcomers. At that time, there was a group of technical personnel in the design department who had just graduated from school and were assigned to work. They were full of vigor when they first came to their jobs, and they were eager to study and work hard. They saw the situation of lax labor discipline and the dominance of erroneous ideas, and most of them demanded a change in the status quo, because they felt that doing so would be letting down the country and the people. However, there were also individuals who leaned towards the backward side, envied the good and free life of some technical personnel, and therefore expressed aversion to political study.
    The above ideological situation was serious, and therefore the losses it brought to the work were also enormous. According to statistics, the design department uncovered a total of 10,500 design errors in a series of movements to establish a responsibility system. Errors occurred in all aspects of preliminary design books, technical design books, construction drawings, and original data. Among them, technical design books and construction drawings had the most errors, accounting for about one-half of the total number. Among these more than 10,000 errors, according to the discussion and analysis of the technical personnel, it was believed that only 2% were caused by their own technical limitations and lack of experience, and the remaining 98% of the errors were caused by the irresponsible and careless style of the technical personnel.
    These errors have had a serious impact on capital construction. For design conducted abroad, the inaccurate original data they provided delayed the design time and also affected the smooth progress of construction. ○
    In the construction of the 190 project, due to incorrect original data, 41% of the drawings were temporarily scrapped and revised. This figure includes how much waste of manpower, material resources, and construction time! The losses caused by domestic design errors to construction projects are even more serious. Due to errors in data collection and design in a certain concentrator plant, the phenomenon of repeated rework was caused, which delayed the project time by as long as two years.
    The various errors in the design work have been able to exist and develop for a relatively long time. This is mainly because the leadership lacks the necessary experience in the management of the design work, and more importantly, the understanding of the ideological transformation of the technical personnel is insufficient. Some old technical personnel are even blindly trusted, and a laissez-faire attitude is adopted towards them, fearing that criticizing the errors of the technical personnel will affect the work. Therefore, the supervision of this design work, which is related to the success or failure of capital construction, was abandoned politically, and no timely struggle was launched against the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and no necessary organizational measures were taken to ensure the quality of the design.
    The great "Three-Anti" movement set off a struggle between new and old ideas. In accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government at higher levels, the leadership began to reverse and change this situation of no one being responsible, and strengthened the political and ideological leadership of the technical personnel, so that the design work could adapt to the long-term construction work of Anshan Iron and Steel.
    In 1952, Anshan Iron and Steel established a political organization for the design department, and in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, established and strengthened political work among the technical personnel. They established the Party's general branch and branch, established the Communist Youth League Committee, workshop trade unions and other organizations, unified the leadership forces inside and outside the Party, cleared out individual bad elements within the Party and mass organizations, and made organizational preparations for mobilizing the masses to conduct work inspections.
    The inspection work adapted to the needs of the work, and first focused on checking the quality of the design and remedying the losses that had been caused. The main method they adopted was to let go of mobilizing the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose various irresponsible and unaccountable phenomena, encourage everyone to consciously conduct self-examination, and also encourage the masses to boldly report and expose. In this way, the design department began to have fresh air, activists among the masses began to emerge, and ideological struggle gradually unfolded. After various stages of work, the final focus was on helping some technical personnel with strong conservative ideas. These people all have certain technical abilities, but their ideological problems are more complicated. Generally, they are unwilling to make examinations, believing that self-criticism is "losing face," "talking bad about themselves," and "the leadership is looking for trouble." The leadership patiently helped them, explaining to them the benefits of eliminating irresponsible ideas and carrying out ideological transformation, and pointing out the path to progress. However, the most effective method was for the leadership to practically help some of them who had better ideological transformation, and encourage them to conduct public self-criticism among the masses. This could more deeply affect other people. For example, an engineer in the civil construction group of the design department publicly exposed his irresponsible phenomena in technology and business management, reviewed his lack of cooperation with colleagues, flattery to superiors, and lack of democracy to subordinates, and made a preliminary criticism from the root of his thinking. This led other engineers and group leaders to conduct self-criticism and examination, breaking the phenomenon of harmony and finding the root cause of the group's unaccountable phenomenon. Some people who originally had no intention of examining their own thoughts began to waver in this situation and made their "first self-criticism in their lives."
    In the struggle to expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible, the leadership used conferences, small meetings, individual talks, and organized exhibitions of the phenomenon of no one being responsible to carry out the work. They focused on guiding everyone to recognize from an ideological point of view the harm that irresponsible design work caused to the country, helping them to find the ideological roots of the errors, eliminating some people's fears of being punished, being dismissed, etc., and making them understand that as long as they resolutely correct their errors, they can do more work for the people. In their words, "We saw the intangible losses (referring to the harm of bourgeois ideology) from the tangible losses caused to the country." Technical personnel with progressive ideas further leaned towards the Party, worked actively, and vigilantly avoided the erosion of old ideas; technical personnel with conservative ideas began to realize that their past irresponsible attitude towards work was wrong, and there was a struggle in their hearts. They said, "Everyone is responsible, and a month's progress exceeds a year's progress. Wouldn't it be even more backward if I don't move forward!" Some engineers said, "This is the first time I have received education from the Party in several years." In this situation, quite a few people's thoughts were mobilized. The Party and mass organizations also began to establish their own work. The face of the work began to change. 90% of all erroneous designs and data were corrected in a timely manner, which reduced a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial expenditures that the country would have paid for erroneous designs. A new atmosphere that had never been seen before also appeared among the technical personnel, and new situations of collectivism such as mutual assistance and cooperation began to emerge. The design of a certain blast furnace was originally scheduled to be completed in March 1953. The person in charge of the project was reluctant after accepting the task, but after the initial mobilization of the masses, everyone consciously conducted discussions to ensure the completion of the plan, and shortened the time to complete the task to the end of November 1952. Many groups submitted guarantees to the Party expressing their determination, and carried out challenges and competitions between groups to guarantee the completion of the task. The engineers of the iron smelting group said: "In order to respond to the call of the higher authorities to produce iron early, our entire group guarantees to hand over the construction drawings one month earlier, at the end of October." The new situation moved the person in charge of the overall engineering design. He said: "I had no confidence in completing the task because I did not see the greatness of the collective strength. The challenges of each group this time have changed my thinking and increased my determination and confidence in completing the task." With everyone using their brains and engineers and technicians working closely together, the design of this blast furnace was completed in three months. If people still remember that it took a whole year to design the same blast furnace, then this means that our design strength has increased threefold in a short period of time!
    Along with the ideological gains, some necessary organizational systems were established on the basis of mobilizing the masses. After discussion among the masses, the design department determined a total of eleven technical standards and responsibility systems, and more than 200 procedural systems were independently proposed by each unit. The most important of these systems is the responsibility system. Everyone must bear the determined responsibility for the data and drawings they handle, and must sign and seal them to indicate that they are responsible to the end. The person in charge of the overall project bears full technical responsibility for the drawings. The second important system is the review system. The Li Mark group organically combines the individual responsibility system with the review system. They specially set up a review team responsible for checking, which is of great help in reducing errors. Facts have proved that only by mobilizing the masses, especially from the ideological point of view, mobilizing engineers and some experienced technicians to participate in the struggle to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible, creating an atmosphere of hatred for the phenomenon of irresponsibility, forming strong supervision of daily work by the broad masses, and generally improving political responsibility can effective responsibility systems be established and adhered to.
    Eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible and establishing a responsibility system is an important part of the ideological transformation work of the design technical personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction unit. They have achieved considerable achievements, but this does not mean that it is perfect. From the current point of view, the main shortcomings of the movement are that the ideological leadership work is not enough, the movement lacks the work of combining actual business to conduct systematic criticism and education, and the mobilization of the masses is not sufficient. Some "dead ends" are still retained in the movement. These shortcomings will be completely overcome in the long-term ideological transformation work. (Attached picture)

    同设计工作中无人负责的现象进行斗争
    ——鞍钢通讯
    安岗
    鞍钢基本建设的设计部门是技术人员集中最多的地方。这些人有的是从生产方面抽调来的，有的是从学校分配来的，他们为鞍钢建设事业作了不少的工作。
    但去年五月以前，在这些技术人员所担负的设计工作中曾经发生一种相当严重的情况，这就是设计工作无人负责的现象。它有着各种不同的表现。
    有些技术人员是有生产和设计经验的。但是他们有着非常浓厚的保守思想，他们各以自己所崇拜的英美德日的技术为资本，你说英国规格好，他说美国标准高，竞相抄袭德国和日本的图纸作为自己设计的本钱，他们盲目相信和依赖德国、日本错误百出的设计资料，不做核对工作。他们彼此之间不团结，在技术上互相封锁，保持秘密，甚至闹派系纠纷。工作上是推来推去，不负责任，负责审核图纸的靠负责设计的，负责设计的靠审核的，你靠我，我靠你，结果谁也没有靠上，而是全都靠了描图员：描成什么样子便是什么样子，无人过问。一张图纸经过几道手续，但是没有一个人负责签字。有些负责审核图纸的工程师，对于送到他面前的图纸不及时处理，到桌上堆满了几十张时，才从中抽出一二张看看，然后随便在几十张图纸上签署发出了事。有的工程师只是在旧图上不负责任地写上一行小字：“此图未经校对只供参考”。描图员有时工作马虎，常常把这行小字漏掉，结果，旧图就顶替成了新图。
    还有一些人，他们过去没有搞过设计工作，或者搞过，但工作还不熟悉，许多事情不懂得该怎么办，因而没有能够很好地负起责任。他们最大的毛病是把设计工作孤立起来看，以为设计工作就是坐在屋子里画图，他们不对实际情况进行调查研究，而是主观主义地搞一套。他们不懂得设计是决定基本建设命运的文件，是对人民负有严重责任的工作，甚至有人轻视设计工作，于是工作上马虎大意，粗枝大叶，造成了无人负责的现象。
    由于在技术人员中没有展开批评与自我批评，这种情况便继续存在下来，而且对新来的人发生了很不好的影响。当时，设计部门曾有一批刚从学校毕业被分配来的技术人员，他们初到工作岗位上，生气勃勃，一心想好好学习和工作。他们看到了劳动纪律松弛，错误思想占上风的情况，大多数人都要求改变现状，因为他们认为这样干下去对不起国家和人民。但也有个别的人倒向落后的一边，羡慕某些技术人员的生活好，自由自在，因而对政治学习表示厌倦。
    上述思想情况是严重的，因而给工作带来的损失也是极大的。据统计，设计部门在建立责任制的一系列运动中，一共揭发了一万零五百件的设计错误。初步设计书、技术设计书、施工图到原始资料各个方面，无一不发生错误，其中技术设计书和施工图的错误最多，约占总数二分之一左右。在这一万多件错误中，根据技术人员的讨论和分析，认为只有百分之二是由于自己技术水平限制、经验不足造成的，其余百分之九十八的错误都是由于技术人员不负责任、粗枝大叶的作风所造成。
    这些错误对基本建设的影响是严重的。对在国外进行设计来说，他们所提供的不准确的原始资料推迟了设计的时间，同时也影响了施工的顺利进行。○
    一九○工程在施工中，由于原始资料不正确，就曾经临时作废和修正了占该工程百分之四十一的图纸。这个数字里面是包括着多么大的人力、物力、建设时间的浪费啊！国内设计的错误给建设工程带来的损失更是严重，某选矿厂因搜集资料和设计有错误，造成一再返工的现象，使工程时间拖延达两年之久。
    设计工作的各种错误得以在较长时间内存在和发展，这主要是由于领导方面对设计工作的管理缺乏必要的经验，而更重要的还是对技术人员的思想改造的工作认识不足，甚至盲目信赖某些旧的技术人员，对他们采取了放任的态度，怕批评了技术人员的错误会影响工作。因而放弃了从政治上来监督这个关系基本建设成败的设计工作，没有及时地同无人负责的现象展开斗争，没有采取各种必要的组织措施来保证设计的质量。
    伟大的“三反”运动掀起了新旧思想的斗争，领导方面按照上级党和政府的指示，开始扭转和改变这种无人负责的局面，加强对技术人员的政治思想领导，以便使设计工作能够适应鞍钢长期建设工作的
    需要。
    鞍钢在一九五二年成立了设计部门的政治机构，按照中共中央东北局的指示，建立和加强了在技术人员中的政治工作。他们建立了党的总支和支部，成立了青年团团委，车间工会等组织，统一了党内外的领导力量，清除了党和群众组织内的个别坏分子，从组织上作了发动群众进行工作检查的准备。
    检查工作适应着工作的需要，首先是把重点放在检查设计质量、补救已经造成的损失上面。他们采取的主要方法是放手发动群众开展批评和自我批评，揭发各种不负责任和无人负责的现象，鼓励每一个人自觉地进行自我检查，同时也鼓励群众大胆地进行检举和揭发。这样，设计部门开始有了新鲜空气，群众中的积极分子开始涌现，思想斗争逐渐展开。经过了各个不同阶段的工作，最后是集中力量帮助一些有着浓厚的保守思想的技术人员。这些人都有一定的技术能力，但是他们的思想问题较为复杂，一般是不愿作检查，认为检讨是“丢面子”，是“自己说自己的坏话”，是“上级找自己的麻烦”。领导方面耐心地帮助他们，向他们说明消灭不负责思想，进行思想改造的好处，指出进步的途径。但是，最有效的办法还是由领导方面实际地帮助他们之中的一些思想转变较好的人，鼓励他们在群众中进行公开的自我检讨，这样便可以比较深刻地影响其他的人。譬如设计部门土建组的一位工程师公开地揭发了自己在技术上、业务管理上的不负责任现象，检讨了自己和同级不合作，对上奉承、对下不民主等等事实，并从思想根源上作了初步的批判，这样便带动了其他的工程师、组长进行检讨和检查，打破了一团和气的现象，找到了该组无人负责现象的总根源。一些原先无意检查自己思想的人，在这种情况下，思想也开始动摇，作了“生平第一次”的检讨。
    在揭发无人负责的现象的斗争中，领导方面通过大会、小会、个别谈话、组织无人负责现象的展览会来进行工作，着重引导大家从思想上认识不负责任的设计工作给国家的危害，帮助他们找出造成错误的思想根源，消除了一些人怕受处分，怕撤职等等顾虑，使他们知道：只要坚决改正错误，自己是可以给人民作更多工作的。用他们的话说是：“从给国家造成的有形的损失中看到了无形的损失（即指资产阶级思想的危害）”。有进步思想的技术人员进一步向党靠拢，积极工作，警惕地避免旧思想的侵蚀；有保守思想的技术人员开始意识到过去那种对工作不负责任的态度是错误的，内心中有了斗争，他们说：“大家都负责任了，一个月的进步超过一年的进步，自己不前进岂不更加落后！”有的工程师说：“这是我几年来第一次受到党的教育”。在这样情况下，相当多的人思想上是动起来了。党和群众组织也开始建立了自己的工作。工作面貌开始改变。全部错误的设计和资料中有百分之九十及时地得到了改正，这就使国家减少了为错误
    设计而付出的一大笔人力、物力和财力的开支。在技术人员中也出现了从来未有的新气象，开始出现了互助合作等集体主义的新局面。某号高炉设计原订一九五三年三月完成，工程负责人接受任务后面有难色，但在群众初步发动后，大家便自觉地进行讨论，保证完成计划，并且把完成任务的时间缩短到
    一九五二年十一月底。不少的组向党提出保证书表示决心，并在组与组之间开展了保证完成任务的挑战和竞赛。炼铁组的工程师表示：“为了响应上级早出铁的号召，我们全组保证再提前一个月，在十月底交出施工图。”新的情况感动了总工程设计的负责人，他说：“我对完成任务没有信心，是因为我没有看到集体力量的伟大，这次各组的挑战，改变了我的思想，提高了我对于完成任务的决心和信心。”在大家开动脑筋，工程师技术员密切合作下，这个高炉的设计在三个月内便完成了。如果，人们还记得同样一个高炉设计整整用了一年时间，那么，这就是说，我们的设计力量在短短一个时间内就提高到三倍！
    随着思想上的收获而来的，是在发动群众基础上确定了一些必要的组织制度。设计部门经过群众讨论，一共确定了十一种技术标准和责任制度，各个单位自行拟建的手续制度有二百多条，这些制度中最重要的是负责制，每一个人对他所处理的资料、图纸都要担负确定的责任，并要签字盖章以表示负责到底。工程总负责人的图纸负有技术上的完全责任。其次一个重要的制度便是审核制，李马可小组便是把个人负责制同审核制度有机地结合在一起，他们专设了一个审核小组负责查对，这对于减少错误大有帮助。事实证明：只有发动群众，特别是从思想上发动工程师和一部分有多年经验的技术员参加消灭无人负责现象的斗争，造成人人对不负责任现象的憎恶气氛，形成广大群众对日常工作的有力监督，普遍地提高政治责任心，这才有可能建立和坚持有效的责任制度。
    消灭无人负责现象，建立责任制，这是鞍钢基本建设单位设计技术人员思想改造工作中的一个重要组成部分。他们取得了相当重要的成就，但这并不是说就是十全十美的了。从现在来看，运动主要缺点是思想领导工作不够，在运动中缺乏结合实际业务进行系统的批判和教育的工作，发动群众不够充分。运动中还保留了一些“死角”，这一些缺点在长期的思想改造的工作中是会完全克服的。（附图片）
