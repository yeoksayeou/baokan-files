    The eyes of the whole world are focused on the Korean War, which has been fought for two and a half years. Because American imperialism continues to adhere to its aggressive policies and attempts to expand the war of aggression, the Korean issue cannot be resolved fairly and reasonably. As we welcome 1953 and strive for new victories and new honors, it is meaningful to recall the past year of 1952.
    1952 was a year of further development for the world's peace cause, and also a year in which the Korean anti-aggression war of justice achieved greater victories and further consolidated those victories.
    Over the past year, under the correct command of Commander Peng Dehuai, the selfless efforts of all comrades in the army, and the brotherly close unity with the Korean People's Army, especially with the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland, our Volunteer Army has achieved new and significant accomplishments, consolidated its existing victories, and prepared favorable conditions for continuing to achieve new victories in the future, giving us more than enough strength to heavily strike the enemy.
    Over the past year, there has been a great change in the balance of power between the enemy and us. As our army becomes stronger and stronger, the enemy's casualties have become even more severe, and their consumption even greater. The American aggressors are completely in a difficult position of being unable to attend to everything at once in terms of strategy. As the war continues, the enemy will become more and more disadvantaged, until it ends in final defeat.
    The reason why the Korean war situation has become more favorable to us is because our army has achieved the following major accomplishments in the past year:
    1. Our army's equipment and technology have been strengthened. In the first year of the Korean anti-aggression war, our army used inferior equipment to defeat the enemy. At that time, the enemy had a great advantage in equipment and technology. What about now? This situation has undergone a great change. Our army's artillery fire has increased, its technology has become more proficient, and especially some of our younger special forces have made amazing progress in the trials of war.
    2. Our army commanders, in terms of tactical command, and our soldiers, in terms of combat actions, have not only gained experience in mobile warfare, but also gained the complete experience of positional attack and defense warfare. Our army's tactical and technical skills in combined arms operations are also becoming increasingly proficient.
    3. Our army and the Korean People's Army jointly constructed solid defensive positions. For more than a year, thanks to the tireless and arduous fortification work of all comrades, overcoming various difficulties, a solid defense system has been completed, especially the construction of tunnel positions, which has made the positions even more solid.
    4. Morale is very high. In the tactical counterattacks of last autumn, all participating units and arms fought with extraordinary bravery and tenacity. This vigorous morale proves that the class consciousness of our army is constantly improving, and the spirit of patriotism and internationalism has made new progress. This high morale can always be maintained in the continuous long-term struggle.
    5. The victory in the struggle against the enemy on the logistics transportation line has guaranteed the sufficient supply of food and ammunition to the front lines. This is because all comrades in our logistics departments have displayed great wisdom and perseverance, so that the front lines not only do not lack food and ammunition, but also deliver a large number of books, magazines, and entertainment equipment, greatly improving the material and spiritual lives of the troops.
    It is precisely because our army has made the above-mentioned achievements and continuous progress in the past year that it has achieved new and significant victories militarily together with the heroic Korean People's Army. In 1952, the Chinese and Korean people's armies annihilated more than 240,000 enemy troops and shot down or damaged more than 5,300 enemy aircraft. In this year, our Chinese and Korean people's armies not only shattered the enemy's thousands of attacks and harassments, consolidated and stabilized their own front lines, but also launched a series of tactical counterattacks last autumn, advancing into the enemy's heavily fortified positions and annihilating enemy platoons and companies. In the tactical counterattacks, the Chinese and Korean people's armies also successively captured more than 70 enemy positions under favorable conditions, more than a dozen of which have been consolidated and occupied by us. Conversely, the largest offensive launched by the enemy in the past year was a complete failure. The enemy used more than 50,000 troops and concentrated a large number of aircraft and artillery to attack two hilltop positions in the Shangganling area north of Jinhua, covering more than four square kilometers, spending more than 40 days and losing more than 25,000 people, but did not even gain a single hilltop.
    Over the past year, the reason why our Volunteer Army has developed so strongly in its coordinated operations with the Korean People's Army is due to many important factors, and the fact that our army is conducting a just war is a fundamental factor; the strength of our army is determined by the laws of the development of just wars. Among the various important factors that have made our army strong, our army's political work has played an important guarantee role in improving the combat effectiveness of the troops. In 1952, an unprecedentedly widespread and in-depth democratic movement under centralized leadership was first launched throughout the army. From senior cadres to soldiers and odd-job personnel, all participated in this movement without exception, conducted ideological and work style inspections, and everyone was educated. Through this democratic movement, the leadership style of cadres has been improved, the concept of loving soldiers has been strengthened, the entire army has been closely united, and comrades generally hope to make contributions and seek glory in the war, and their desire to improve and their enthusiasm have been further enhanced. Many comrades work diligently, their learning attitude is also better than before, and they are determined to strive for the complete victory of the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and the final realization of peace in Korea. In particular, leading comrades at all levels have generally paid attention to the lives of the troops. According to the understanding in September last year, daily necessities such as cigarettes, lighters, toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, diaries, pens, and stationery were available in the companies. The company's meals have been made to average two dishes and one soup per meal, and some units that have been adjusted better can drink soy milk, eat fried dough sticks, and eat dumplings. Entertainment equipment, such as harmonicas, huqin, playing cards, chess, checkers, etc., are available in each squad and platoon; and various units have many radios, phonographs, basketballs, carrom boards, accordions and other cultural and entertainment equipment.
    Since being invited to participate in the "August 1st" Sports Meeting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army last year, our army's sports activities have also been launched; the troops' literary and artistic activities are also very active. Singing groups, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, radio stations, clubs, libraries, sports fields, etc., have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. The cultural work troupes (teams) of various units have gone deep into the companies to help them run wall newspapers, write quick clappers, teach singing, organize evening parties, teach soldiers to read, read newspapers, write letters home, and write challenge letters. Female members of the cultural work troupe also help the cooks to cook, mend clothes for the soldiers, take care of the wounded, and wash bloody clothes. The film teams also go to the companies more often.
    The above-mentioned work has made the material and spiritual lives of the companies well improved (of course, more efforts are needed to do better). The revolutionary optimistic mood in the troops is also very full, and the determination and confidence to carry out a long-term war have also been further strengthened.
    In addition, in the past year, education in patriotism, internationalism, and current affairs policies has been continuously carried out, especially through the activities of the Second Return-to-Country Delegation, the "August 1st" Sports Meeting Delegation, the National Day Observation Delegation, the Second Delegation of the People of the Motherland to Korea for Comfort, and the awarding of medals to our army by the Korean government, which has greatly deepened the troops' love for the motherland and the Korean people. The slogan "Add glory to the motherland" and "Make international contributions" has become the force that inspires every soldier to fight bravely. Like Comrade Huang Jiguang, a young correspondent of the Matrosov type who sacrificed himself to blow up a bunker (member of the New Democratic Youth League), he said to his comrades when performing his mission: "Tell the comfort delegation of the people of the motherland, listen to my victory news!" He carried a grenade and rushed towards the enemy's firepower point, showing a high degree of self-sacrifice and making the battle a victory. The heroic deeds of Comrade Sun Zhanyuan, Qiu Shaoyun and other comrades who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the whole and for the victory of the battle are well known and admired by everyone. In our army, such heroic figures continue to emerge, countless. In battle, many people were wounded several times and did not leave the front line, or felt sad because they were wounded and left the position, and some wounded soldiers climbed down from the stretcher to continue fighting. These all show that our army's revolutionary heroism has been further developed.
    Over the past year, our army and the Korean People's Army have fought side by side more closely, and the Korean people have loved and supported our army even more, which has given our army great encouragement and education, and further enhanced our army's internationalist ideology. Especially in the battle in the Shangganling area, the residents of the battlefield, regardless of men, women, old or young, automatically helped our army to transfer the wounded, and they were very enthusiastic, considerate, and loving to the wounded. Those who carried the stretchers often covered the wounded with their own quilts, always afraid that the wounded would be cold, and they also brought their own apples and dry food to quench the wounded's thirst and fill their hunger. The most touching thing was the appearance of the Korean Luo Shengjiao - Park Jae-geun. When enemy planes bombed and strafed, Comrade Park Jae-geun climbed on the wounded soldier to protect the wounded from being injured a second time, sacrificing himself to save the life of the wounded soldier. Some landlords shed tears of sorrow when they saw that the soldiers who had lived in their homes were wounded. Many Korean women also rushed to participate in the transfer of the wounded, one of whom washed 700 bloody clothes for our army's wounded soldiers. These vivid examples of cherishing and supporting our army not only increased our army's courage to fight, but also more powerfully educated our troops. In the past year, our army has also helped the Korean people cultivate land, reclaim wasteland, fertilize, deliver manure, plant rice, repair canals, build dams, build sluices, reservoirs, water storage ponds, plant trees, etc., during the breaks in the battle, and also used the saved grain to relieve the Korean disaster victims, and helped the Korean people build houses and dig air-raid shelters in the areas bombed by enemy planes, and bandaged and treated the injured. This unbreakable combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged with blood, is becoming increasingly consolidated.
    Over the past year, our army's units have strengthened the construction of the Communist Party branches, improved the level of party members, and further strengthened the exemplary role of many party members. The party has a high prestige among the masses, and the masses recognize that the party is glorious, great, and correct, so they actively apply to join the party and ask the branch to test them in battle. In addition, significant achievements have also been made in strengthening the party's leadership over the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the Youth League has played the role of a powerful assistant to the party. Therefore, doing a good job in the party's work is the basic guarantee for all our army's work.
    On the basis of this series of political work, our army has also widely launched a merit-making campaign. This campaign has been very successful. Because all the cadres and soldiers of our army have a high degree of class consciousness, the merit-making campaign can easily form a revolutionary heroic competition. Everyone regards being assigned to the most difficult position as glorious, and therefore feels proud. "Making international contributions" and "Seeing Chairman Mao after making contributions" are the hopes and wishes that everyone holds. Because our army has this great revolutionary heroic spirit, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. In this campaign, countless heroic figures who overcame difficulties and made outstanding achievements emerged in various units.
    In addition, our army showed more unity and love. From top to bottom, between arms and services, they can encourage and help each other, and many unprecedented moving examples of unity and love have emerged. In the second half of last year, the work of disintegrating the enemy by our troops made new achievements, and the political offensives against the enemy that were widely launched by various units on the front line have had a certain effect. Our army also used the breaks in the battle to vigorously engage in crash learning of culture, and a vigorous learning movement was launched throughout the army. Learning culture has become the most favorite thing for comrades with low cultural levels, and everyone unanimously shouted to be a revolutionary soldier with both cultural and military skills. This work has now achieved preliminary results, and once the plan is completed, it will play a significant role in improving our army's combat effectiveness.
    The past year has been a year of growing strength for our Volunteer Army. We have made great achievements on all fronts, and there has been great progress in all aspects of our work. However, we must not be satisfied with the achievements of the past, but must continue to work hard and do better in 1953.
    Judging from the current situation, the enemy is unwilling to stop the war on the Korean battlefield, and they want to continue fighting. In order to save its military and political failure, American imperialism is now actively planning new adventures. Therefore, all commanders, fighters and staff of our army must be very vigilant and strengthen various war preparations; if the enemy dares to take risks, then we will hit them hard and make them bleed. We can say with certainty that the enemy's conspiracies and tricks will inevitably lead to complete bankruptcy. Because our Volunteer Army, in cooperation with the Korean People's Army, has achieved great and brilliant victories in the brave and tenacious struggle against American imperialism and its accomplices for more than two years, and has accumulated rich combat experience. Facts have proved that American imperialism has adopted many methods to fight us in the past, and the results have all been failures. Now the enemy wants to take the risk of attacking us again. If they really dare to do so, we will give them a resolute head-on blow and make them suffer even greater failures.
    As we joyfully bid farewell to 1952 and enter the New Year of 1953, the entire army must be fully prepared to resolutely smash the enemy's new adventures and any military offensives. The political work tasks for 1953 should focus on the overall task of fighting well. In accordance with the order issued by Commander Peng Dehuai to the entire army on October 25, 1952, we must more deeply strengthen the patriotic and internationalist education of the troops, strengthen the construction of the Communist Party branches, and further ensure the consolidation of positions, the improvement of tactical technology and culture, so as to consolidate and strengthen our army's combat effectiveness; at the same time, we must constantly educate the troops to respect all comrades of the Korean Party, government, and army, unite the Korean people, launch political offensives against the enemy, and strive for greater victories in the war.
    Finally, with full confidence in victory, we are moving towards 1953! Let us work together to strive for new victories and new honors! (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民志愿军更加强大的一年
    中国人民志愿军政治部副主任    杜平
    全世界人民瞩目的朝鲜战争，已经打了两年半了。由于美帝国主义仍然坚持侵略政策，并企图扩大侵略战争，致使朝鲜问题不能求得公平合理的解决。在迎接一九五三年，争取新的胜利与新的荣誉的时候，对才过去的一九五二年作一番回忆，是有意义的。
    一九五二年是全世界和平事业更加向前发展的一年，也是朝鲜反侵略正义战争获得更大胜利与进一步巩固胜利的一年。
    一年来，我志愿军在彭德怀司令员的正确指挥之下，在全军同志忘我的努力之下，以及在与朝鲜人民军兄弟般的紧密团结之下，尤其在祖国人民的热烈支援之下，获得了新的重大的成就，巩固了既得的胜利，准备了今后继续取得新胜利的良好条件，使我们更有充分的力量去沉重地打击敌人。
    一年来，敌我力量的消长发生了很大变化。随着我军的愈战愈强，敌人的伤亡更加惨重，消耗更加浩大了。美国侵略者在战略上完全处在顾此失彼的困难地步。战争持续下去，敌人将愈打愈不利，直至以最后失败而告终。
    朝鲜战局其所以变得对我更加有利，是因为我军在一年来获得了如下的重大成就：
    一、我军的装备与技术加强了。朝鲜反侵略战争的第一个年头，我军是用劣势装备来击败敌人的。那时，敌人在装备与技术上占着极大的优势。现在呢？这种情况有了极大的改变，我军的炮火增多了，技术熟练了，特别是我军的某些较年轻的特种兵在战争的锻炼中有了惊人的进步。
    二、我军指挥员在战术指挥上，战斗员在战斗动作上，不仅有了运动战的经验，而且还取得了阵地攻防战的全套经验。我军各兵种联合作战的战术、技术也日益熟练了。
    三、我军与朝鲜人民军共同构筑了坚固的阵地。一年多来，由于全体同志日以继夜地进行艰苦的筑城作业，克服了种种困难，业已完成了坚固的防御体系，尤其是坑道阵地的构成，使得阵地更加巩固了。
    四、士气非常之高。在去年秋季战术反击中，所有参战的各部队、各兵种，都打得异常的英勇顽强。这种旺盛的士气，证明了我军部队的阶级觉悟在不断的提高，爱国主义与国际主义精神有了新的发展。这种高涨的士气，在持续的长期斗争中，是始终能够保持饱满的。
    五、后勤运输线上对敌斗争的胜利，保证了前线粮弹的充分供应。这是由于我后勤各部门全体同志发挥了高度的智慧与毅力，使前线不仅不缺粮弹，而且还运送了大批图书、杂志和娱乐器具，大大地改善了部队的物质生活与精神生活。
    正因为我军一年来有了上述的各项成就和不断的进步，因此在军事上与英勇的朝鲜人民军共同取得了新的重大胜利。在一九五二年，朝中人民军队已歼灭敌军二十四万多人，击落击伤敌机五千三百多架。这一年中我朝中人民军队不仅粉碎了敌人千百次的攻击和窜扰，巩固和稳定了自己的战线，而且在去年秋季举行了一连串的战术反击，进到敌人坚固设防的阵地上歼灭成排成连的敌人。在战术反击中，朝中人民军队并在有利条件下先后攻占敌军阵地七十多处，其中有十多处阵地已被我巩固地加以占领。相反地，一年来敌军发动的最大的一次攻势却是彻底地失败了。敌人动用了五万多人的兵力，集中了大量飞机、大炮，向金化以北上甘岭地区四平方多公里的两个山头阵地进攻，费了四十多天时间，损失了两万五千多人，结果却连一个山头也没有得到。
    一年来，我志愿军在与朝鲜人民军协同作战中所以发展得如此强大，重要的因素很多，而我军进行的是正义战争这一点则是一个基本的因素；我军的强大，是正义战争发展规律所决定的。在使我军强大的各种重要因素中，我军的政治工作对提高部队的战斗力起了重要的保证作用。一九五二年，首先在全军展开了一个空前普遍与深入的、在集中领导下的民主运动，从高级干部到战士和勤杂人员，都无一例外地参加了这个运动，进行了思想作风检查，人人受到了教育。经过这次民主运动，干部领导作风有了改进，加强了爱兵观点，全军上下亲密团结，同志们普遍希望在战争中立功求荣，上进心与积极性更加增强了。许多同志兢兢业业地工作，学习态度也比以前好了，都坚决表示要争取抗美援朝战争的彻底胜利，朝鲜和平的最后实现。特别是各级领导同志普遍重视了部队的生活。据去年九月份的了解，连队中的纸烟、打火机、牙膏、牙刷、肥皂、日记本、笔、信纸等日用品都有了。连队伙食已做到每顿平均两菜一汤，部分单位调剂得较好的能喝豆浆、吃油条、吃饺子。娱乐器具，如口琴、胡琴、扑克、象棋、跳棋等，各班各排都有了；而且各部队有了不少收音机、留声机、篮球、康乐球、手风琴等文化娱乐器具。
    自从去年应邀参加中国人民解放军“八一”体育运动大会后，我军的体育运动也开展起来了；部队文艺活动也很活跃。歌咏组、墙报、黑板报、广播站、俱乐部、图书馆、运动场等，更是雨后春笋般
    地相继成立。各部队文工团（队）均已深入连队，帮助连队办墙报、写快板、教唱歌、组织晚会，教
    战士识字、读报、写家信、写挑战书。女文工团员
    还帮炊事员做饭，替战士缝补衣服，照顾伤员和洗
    血衣。电影队下连队的次数也多了。
    上述这些工作，使连队的物质生活与精神生活都
    得到了良好的改善（当然要做得更好，还需作更大
    的努力）。部队中革命的乐观主义的情绪也很饱满，
    进行持久作战的决心与信心也更为增强。
    此外，这一年来还不断地进行了爱国主义与国际主义和时事政策的教育，特别是通过了二次归国代表团、“八一”体育运动大会代表团、国庆节观礼代表团、祖国人民第二届赴朝慰问团的活动和朝鲜政府给我军授勋，大大地加深了部队热爱祖国与热爱朝鲜人民的思想，“为祖国增光”“立国际功”的口号成了鼓舞每一个战士英勇作战的力量。像马特洛索夫式的舍身炸地堡的青年通讯员黄继光同志
    （新民主主义青年团员），在执行任务时就向战友们说：“告诉祖国人民慰问团，听我的胜利消息吧！”他便提着手雷向敌人的火力点冲去，表现了高度的自我牺牲精神，使战斗取得了胜利。像为了整体，为了战斗胜利牺牲自己生命的孙占元、邱少云等同志的壮烈事迹，已是人人皆知，人人敬仰。在我军中，像这样的英雄人物，不断出现，数不胜数。在战斗中，有许多人负伤几次不下火线，或因负伤离开阵地而心里难过，有的伤员在担架上还要爬下来继续战斗。这些都显示出我军的革命英雄主义精神已进一步地发扬了。
    一年来，我军和朝鲜人民军更加亲密地并肩作战，朝鲜人民也更加热爱和支援我军，这些都给我军以极大的鼓励和教育，更加提高了我军的国际主义思想。特别是在这次上甘岭地区的战斗中，战地居民不分男女老少自动帮助我军转送伤员，而且对伤员十分热情，十分体贴，十分爱护。抬担架的往往把自己的被子盖在伤员身上，总是怕伤员冻着，他们并且自带苹果和干粮，给伤员解渴和充饥。最感动人的是出现了朝鲜的罗盛教——朴在根。当敌机投弹扫射时，朴在根同志为了不使伤员二次受伤，自己爬在伤员身上，舍身救护了伤员的生命。有些房东见到住过他家里的战士负了伤，悲痛得流出了眼泪。不少朝鲜妇女也争先恐后地参加转运伤员，其中有一位妇女替我军伤员洗了七百件血衣。这些爱护我军与支援我军的生动事例，不仅增加了我军战斗的勇气，并且更加有力地教育了我军部队。一年来，我军也在战斗空隙中帮助朝鲜人民耕地开荒、施肥、送粪、插秧、修水渠、筑坝、修建水闸、水库、蓄水池、植树等，还把节约的粮食救济朝鲜灾民，在被敌机轰炸的地区帮助朝鲜人民修建住所和挖防空洞，给伤者进行包扎和医疗。这种中朝人民牢不可破的、用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊是愈加巩固了。
    一年来，我军各部队在加强共产党支部工作的建设上，提高了党员水平，使许多党员的带头作用进一步加强了。党在群众中的威信很高，群众都认识到党是光荣的、伟大的、正确的，因而积极申请入党，要求支部在战斗中考验他。此外在加强党对中国新民主主义青年团的领导方面，也获得了显著的成绩，青年团发挥了党的有力的助手作用。因此做好党的工作，是我军各项工作的基本保证。
    我军在这一系列的政治工作的基础上，还广泛地开展了立功运动。这个运动是开展得很成功的。因为我军的全体干部、战士都具有高度的阶级觉悟，立功运动就容易形成革命英雄主义的大竞赛。人人都把被分配到最艰苦的岗位上看做光荣，因而感到骄傲。“立国际功”“立了功见毛主席”，是人人怀抱的希望和意愿。我军由于有了这种伟大的革命英雄主义气概，就没有克服不了的困难。在这一运动中，各部队都涌现了无数克服困难、建立卓著功绩的英雄人物。
    此外，在我军内部表现出更加团结友爱。上上下下，兵种与兵种之间，都能互相鼓励，互相帮助，并且出现了许多前所未有的动人的团结友爱的范例。去年下半年，部队的瓦解敌军工作有了新的成绩，各部队在前线普遍展开的对敌政治攻势，有了
    一定的收效。我军并也用战斗空隙，大力突击学习文化，全军展开了轰轰烈烈的学习运动，学习文化成了文化程度低的同志的最喜爱的一件事，大家一致喊出要当个文武兼备的革命军人。这项工作现已获得了初步成绩，一旦完成计划，将对我军战斗力的提高，发挥重大的作用。
    过去的一年，是我志愿军部队更加强大的一年，我们在各个战线上都有很大的成就，各方面的工作也有很大的进步。但是我们决不能满足过去的成就，还须继续努力，要在一九五三年做得更好。
    从目前情况来看，敌人在朝鲜战场上决不愿停止战争，他们要继续打下去。美帝国主义为了挽救它在军事上、政治上的失败，现正积极策划新的冒险。因此，我军全体指挥员、战斗员和工作人员必须十分警惕，加强各项战备工作；如敌人敢于冒险，那么我们就狠狠地把它打得头破血流。我们可以肯定地说：敌人的阴谋诡计，必将招致彻底破产。因为我志愿军协同朝鲜人民军在两年多以来反对美帝国主义及其帮凶军的英勇顽强的战斗中，已经取得了伟大的光辉的胜利，积蓄了丰富的战斗经验。事实证明美帝国主义过去采用了很多办法同我们作斗争，结果都是失败了。现在敌人又想冒险向我们进攻，如果他真的敢于这样做，我们就给他们一个坚决的迎头痛击，叫他们遭到更大的失败。
    当我们在欢欣鼓舞地送别一九五二年进入一九五三年新年之际，全军必须充分准备好，坚决粉碎敌人新的冒险和任何军事进攻。一九五三年的政治工作任务，应围绕着打好仗这一总任务，遵照彭德怀司令员一九五二年十月二十五日向全军发布的命令，更深入地加强对部队的爱国主义与国际主义教育，加强共产党的支部建设，进一步保证阵地巩固，战术技术与文化提高，以巩固和加强我军战斗力；同时不断地教育部队尊重朝鲜党、政、军全体同志，团结朝鲜人民，展开对敌政治攻势，争取战争更大的胜利。
    最后，我们满怀胜利的信心，向着一九五三年迈进！让我们一致努力，争取新的胜利和新的荣誉！  （新华社）
