    Opposing Conservative and Backward Thinking in Design

    Faced with the arduous task of large-scale capital construction for our country's industrialization, we must promptly pay attention to the current backward situation in design work, and we must take improving the ideological level of design work and enhancing design capabilities as an urgent and serious task. Because after the state has formulated correct construction plans and has the necessary construction resources, without design capabilities, we will not be able to realize the plan; if the design is incorrect, it will cause serious waste of state assets and extremely unreasonable phenomena in industrial construction, and may even lead our industrial construction to the wrong path. Therefore, design workers bear a major task for the country's basic construction.

    In the past few years, we have used considerable effort to establish some design institutions, and many technicians in the design departments have also carried out arduous and beneficial work, and have gained a lot of experience and achievements in design. However, it must be pointed out that, on the one hand, in many design institutions and design personnel (including administrative leaders and technicians), a correct ideology to guide design work has not yet been established, and many erroneous, conservative bourgeois technical viewpoints seriously exist in almost all our design departments; on the other hand, this backward state, this erroneous ideological viewpoint, has not received the necessary criticism and due improvement, and still affects design work to varying degrees. In order to change this situation and improve the ideological level and design capabilities of design work, it is necessary to launch an exposure and criticism of various erroneous ideological viewpoints, launch self-criticism in design institutions, and launch learning from advanced design ideas.

    Not long ago, in the newspaper of January 20th of this year, we criticized the designers of the Northeast First Ceramic Factory for not understanding economic accounting from the perspective of the overall interests of the country and the people, and for not having a correct guiding ideology, which resulted in serious waste. We can now give another example of a smelter design to illustrate the consequences of this error. The following is a passage from a report written by comrades who inspected the design: (For general readers, some of the technical terms in this passage and in the following article need to be learned, but if we are determined to understand the specific problems in industrial construction, we cannot be afraid of this inevitable trouble. Remember: behind these small troubles lies the success or failure of industrial construction, and the fate of tens of billions of hundreds of billions of state wealth!)

    "(1) In the mining and beneficiation section, the design of the plant mainly relies on past data and existing foundations. The data was not carefully reviewed in advance, and the design was carried out blindly, which caused many problems. For example, the designers determined in the design to use only rich-grade ore, but in fact, ore that is 50 percent lower in grade than the original designers determined also needs to be extracted and should be extracted. The record of the amount of ore is also inaccurate. Up to now, the amount of ore that can be confirmed is only one-third of the original data. Because resource surveys and geological exploration work were not carried out, problems also occurred in the construction of the factory buildings. After some factory buildings and dormitories were built, it was discovered that there were minerals underground, and now the relocation of these factory buildings and dormitories is being considered. In addition, the vast majority of the mechanical equipment for mineral processing was left over from the past. How the equipment performs, the degree of obsolescence and effectiveness, have not been well inspected or appraised, and most of them have been installed without any changes. After the trial run, many equipment failures were discovered. For more than half a year, it has been tested and repaired, and it has not yet ended. (2) Poor design has resulted in an imbalance in production equipment. For example, the ball milling and flotation capacity of the concentrator is small, while the crushing and filtration capacity is large, with a difference of about one time; the sintering capacity of the smelter is small, while the capacity of the ore melting furnace is large. Taking the concentrator and smelter as an example, the concentrator has a small capacity, and the smelter has a large capacity. In addition, the capacity of the power plant is small, and there will be problems with power supply in 1953. It can barely cope with the first half of the year, but it will not be able to solve it in the second half of the year. (3) There are also many unreasonable situations in the project caused by sloppy design. For example, the factory building of the concentrator uses a wooden structure, which is said to have a life of only three to five years; the ore storage bins for storing ore sand and copper concentrate are all flat-bottomed, and the ore sand cannot flow out automatically, and manual handling is required. In the smelter, the factory building design and the equipment design are not connected, some are wide and some are narrow. The two pillars next to the copper melting furnace had to be removed because they interfered with the operation, and a thickened beam was used instead. The large gear of the sintering machine could not be placed, so the beam had to be dug out. The casting machine could not be installed because the place was too small. Because the furnace structure of the copper melting furnace was not well designed, the humidity below was too high, which reduced the furnace temperature, and the front bed froze as soon as it was tested on November 19. The two furnaces of the copper blowing furnace have only one set of transmission devices. If one is turned on, the other must be stopped. Although it has not been tested yet, another set will have to be set up separately in 1953. ... There are many things like this."

    The facts presented in this inspection report first illustrate that many of our cadres and technicians have not yet established the idea of the country's overall economic accounting. Our state-owned enterprises are socialist enterprises. When we design any factory or mine, we must proceed from the long-term interests of the entire country and consider how to rationally utilize national resources. However, the designers of this smelter did not have such an idea. On the one hand, they did not make a serious analysis of the ore grade, and on the other hand, they only considered using rich ore with high copper content, and did not consider how to use lower-grade ore when the copper grade of the ore might decrease during the mining process. From the perspective of the country's economic accounting, lower-grade ore is technically completely usable and economically should be used. Only bourgeois entrepreneurs, for their own personal interests, often disregard the waste of national underground resources when mining mines, and would rather discard usable but low-grade ore and only take high-grade ore in order to ensure their personal high profits. We must use the economic accounting perspective of the overall interests of the country to oppose the incorrect ideas of the bourgeoisie that proceed from partial and temporary interests. If we do not overcome the bourgeois point of view of starting from partial and temporary interests ideologically, it will inevitably cause long-term losses to the country.

    Secondly, this inspection report also shows that there is a lack of overall design thinking in this design work. To design a large-scale factory or mine, the basis of the design must be clarified in advance. Only in this way can the correct factory construction policy and overall design be made, and economically and technically reasonable plans can be proposed. However, the designers of the smelter did not have this overall design thinking. When designing this project, even resource exploration was considered dispensable. Before the design, they did not conduct a serious exploration of underground resources, but only based on unreliable and incomplete materials from the past, assuming that the amount of burial was hundreds of thousands of tons, which of course would definitely cause problems with the correctness of the design. That is to say, because the basis of the design has problems, even if there is an overall design, errors will occur. At the same time, because the designers did not have overall design thinking and carried out factory construction design without underground resource exploration, the houses built according to the design were built exactly on top of the mineral deposits, which inevitably forced them to consider relocating.

    Again, this design did not adopt advanced technical achievements to the extent possible, but instead engaged in design with conservative and backward technical viewpoints. Designers should be propagators and organizers of advanced ideas and advanced technical achievements. Designers should most keenly consider and absorb new scientific achievements in their own designs, and apply new technical achievements to new factories and mines as much as possible according to specific conditions. Only in this way can our newly built factories and mines be more economically reasonable and technically improved. At present, although many of our designers have felt the need to learn the advanced technical theory of the Soviet Union, there are still more people who adhere to conservative technical theories. They do not know that the speed of Soviet scientific progress, guided by dialectical materialism as an ideology, has greatly exceeded the speed that bourgeois countries can achieve. Under this ideological state, our designers cannot obtain technically advanced theories, and they still regard the dogmas obtained from bourgeois countries or schools long ago as classics. The design of the smelter mentioned above shows how seriously technical conservatism affects our designers. For example, the original design of the plant, according to the technical standards of capitalist countries, stipulated that its production capacity was 2,000 tons, but according to the research of Soviet experts, as long as the backward technical standards are abandoned and new scientific achievements are adopted, the production capacity of 10,000 tons can be achieved by adding only a small number of equipment under the condition of using the original building. Why is there such a big difference between the two? This is because the original design adopted backward Japanese standards in terms of continuous sintering machines (each square meter of effective area can only sinter eight tons). If it is designed according to advanced standards, the productivity of each square meter of effective area will be increased by more than three times. In terms of ore melting furnaces, the backward quota adopted by the original design for the tuyere section was 25 tons per square meter. If advanced technical standards are adopted, it can reach 60 to 120 tons. In terms of blowing, the error in the transmission device of the original design greatly limited its own production capacity; in terms of production operating systems, the original design adopted backward technical standards and did not adopt modern multi-layer sintering furnaces and reverberatory furnace smelting methods. Therefore, Soviet experts believe that as long as it is transformed according to new technical achievements and another sintering machine and a small part of other equipment are added, it is entirely possible to increase the capacity of the entire factory by five times. From this, we can see how important advanced technical theory and the thinking of designers are in basic construction.

    Also, designers must consider the balance between various workshops and sub-factories for the factories and mines they are responsible for designing. For large-scale factories and mines that require several years to complete the entire project, they should also consider how to achieve the balance between each other when the workshops begin to be partially put into production. Because only in this way can the accumulation and waste of national funds and materials be avoided as much as possible. However, the designers of the smelter we mentioned did not even carefully consider the former minimum requirement for balance. The concentrator it designed has a grinding and flotation capacity that is almost half the crushing and filtration capacity; in terms of smelting, the sintering capacity is also half the furnace capacity; and the overall beneficiation capacity and smelting capacity are extremely inconsistent. In addition, the factory building design and equipment design cannot adapt to each other. All these facts also show that this design is a lack of thoughtful
    "patchwork", and the losses it caused are serious. For such a newly built factory, when it is just about to be put into production, the state will have to allocate a lot of funds to renovate it again!

    Finally, this design also did not pay attention to overcoming the idea of neglecting technical safety and labor protection in bourgeois design, and did not do
    everything possible to consider labor protection conditions. Therefore, after the construction is completed, a series of technical safety problems cannot be solved. For example, water and gas pipelines are incorrectly set up next to the refining furnace and blowing furnace, so that in an emergency, if the mine water is put on the workshop floor (this phenomenon is entirely possible in the work), it will cause unexpected failures in the water and gas pipeline lines. For example, in terms of labor protection, even for sulfurized gas that seriously damages the health of workers, no consideration has been given to how to treat it to make it harmless and useful.

    Why do we analyze the errors in the design of this smelter in such detail? Because this design provides a typical example for everyone to understand what is the wrong idea in design and how serious damage this wrong idea will cause to the country's construction cause. We must resolutely oppose all "design patchwork" that lacks correct guidance. We hope that the design department will launch a general inspection to expose various wrong designs and criticize various wrong ideas. Only in this way will the road be opened for advanced design work, and industrial construction and other basic construction will not suffer heartbreaking and sometimes irreparable losses.

    反对设计中的保守落后思想
    在为我国工业化而进行的大规模基本建设的艰巨任务面前，我们必须及时地注意到目前在设计工作方面的落后状况，必须把提高设计工作的思想水平、增强设计能力当作目前一项迫切而严重的工作。因为在国家制定了正确的建设计划，有了必要的建设资源之后，如果没有设计能力，我们就不可能把计划付之实现；如果设计得不正确，它就会造成国家资财严重的浪费和工业建设极不合理的现象，甚至可能把我们的工业建设引到错误的道路上去。因此，设计工作者对于国家的基本建设负有重大的任务。
    在过去几年中，我们曾用相当大的力量建立了一些设计机构，设计部门中许多技术人员，也曾进行了艰苦的和有益的工作，并且在设计中取得了不少经验与成绩。然而必须指出：一方面在很多设计机构和设计人员（包括行政领导干部和技术人员）中，还没有树立起指导设计工作的正确思想，许多错误的、保守的资产阶级的技术观点，几乎在我们所有的设计部门中都严重地存在着；另一方面，这种落后状态、这种错误的思想观点还没有得到必要的批判和应有的改进，还在不同程度上影响着设计工作。为了改变这种状况，提高设计工作的思想水平和设计能力，就必须展开对各种错误思想观点的揭露、批判，展开设计机构中的自我批评，展开向先进的设计思想的学习。
    不久以前，在今年一月二十日的报纸上，我们曾批评了东北第一陶瓷厂的设计者由于不从国家和人民整体利益的观点去理解经济核算，没有正确的指导思想，因而造成了严重的浪费。我们现在可以再举一个冶炼厂的设计来说明这种错误的后果。下面是检查该项设计的同志所写报告中的一段：（对于一般的读者来说，这一段话里和后面的文章里有些专门的术语是需要学习的，但是我们决心要了解工业建设中的具体问题，就不能怕这一点不可避免的麻烦。要记着：在这些小小的麻烦背后，就是工业建设的成败，就是几十亿几百亿国家财富的命运啊！）
    “（一）在采矿与选矿部分，该厂的设计主要是依赖过去的资料和旧有基础为根据的。对于这些资料，事先都没有详细审查，就盲目进行设计，因而发生了不少问题。譬如，设计工作者在设计中确定采用的完全是富品位的矿石，但实际上比原设计者确定品位低百分之五十的矿石，也是需要采取的和应该采取的。矿量的记载也不准确，直到现在能肯定的矿量，只有原资料中的三分之一。由于资源调查和地质勘测工作没有进行，厂房的修建也就发生了问题。有些厂房和宿舍盖好以后，发现其地下有矿，现在正考虑这些厂房和宿舍的搬家问题。另外，选矿的机械设备绝大多数都是过去留下的，其设备性能怎样，陈旧程度和效用，也都没有很好检查、鉴定，大都原封不动地往上安装，到试车后就发现了很多设备不良的现象。半年多来，边试边修，到现在还没有结束。（二）设计不周，造成生产设备上的不平衡。例如：选矿厂的球磨、浮选能力小，破碎和过滤能力大，相差有一倍左右；冶炼厂的烧结能力小，熔矿炉的能力大。拿选矿、冶炼两厂来说，选矿厂能力小，冶炼厂能力大。此外，电厂的能力小，一九五三年供电就要发生问题，上半年还可勉强应付，下半年就无法解决了。（三）设计草率，造成工程上不合理的情况也很多。例如选矿厂的厂房用的是木结构，据说只有三五年的寿命；储藏矿砂和铜精砂的储矿仓，都用的是平底，矿砂不能全部自动流出，要用人工来处理。冶炼厂方面，厂房设计和设备设计没有联系，有的宽，有的狭。熔铜炉旁的两个柱子因妨碍操作，只好打掉，改用加厚横梁的办法，烧结机的大牙轮放不下，只好把梁给挖去一块。浇铸机因地方太小安装不上。熔铜炉由于炉子结构没有设计好，下面湿度太大，降低了炉子温度，十一月十九日一试车就冻结了前床。吹铜炉两个炉子只有一套传动装置，开一个就得停另一个，虽然现在还没有试车，一九五三年却又要分开另设一套。……诸如此类的事情是很多的。”
    这份检查报告所提出的事实，首先说明了我们的许多干部和技术人员，还没有树立起国家的整体的经济核算的思想。我们的国营企业是社会主义性质的企业，我们设计任何一个工厂或矿山，都必须从整个国家的长期利益出发，考虑怎样才能合理地运用国家资源。但是这个冶炼厂的设计者却没有这样的思想。他们一方面对矿石品位不作认真的分析，另一方面又只考虑到利用含铜量很高的富矿石，而没有考虑到在采矿过程中矿石含铜品位可能下降时如何利用较低品位的矿石。而从国家的经济核算观点来看，较低品位的矿石在技术上是完全可能使用的，在经济价值上也是应该使用的。只有资产阶级的企业主，他们为了个人的利益，在开采矿山时，往往不顾浪费国家地下资源，宁肯把完全有使用价值但品位较低的矿石弃置不用，而只采取高品位的矿石，借以保证他们个人的高额利润。我们必须以国家整体利益的经济核算观点去反对资产阶级的这种不正确的思想。如果不在思想上克服资产阶级从局部和暂时利益出发的观点，就一定要造成国家长期的损失。
    其次，这个检查报告也说明了在这项设计工作中缺乏总体设计思想。设计一个较大规模的厂矿，必须事前弄清设计的根据，只有如此才能做出正确的建厂方针和总体设计，才能提出经济上技术上合理的方案。但是冶炼厂的设计者，并没有这种总体设计的思想。在设计这一工程时，甚至连资源的勘查都被认为是可有可无的。他们在设计之前不对地下资源加以认真的勘探，仅仅依据了过去不可靠的而且是不完全的材料，假定埋藏量为多少万吨，这样当然就一定使设计的正确性发生问题。也就是说，由于设计的根据发生了问题，即使有了总体设计，也是会发生错误的。同时，由于设计者没有总体设计思想，不经地下资源的勘查就进行建厂设计，因而根据设计所建筑的房屋，有的恰恰盖在了矿藏之上，这就不能不被迫地去考虑重新搬家的问题。
    再次，在这项设计中没有在可能范围内采取先进的技术成就，而是以保守的落后的技术观点去从事设计。设计工作者应该是先进思想和先进技术成就的传播者和组织者。设计工作者应该在自己的设计中，最敏锐地考虑和吸收科学上的新成就，根据具体条件，尽可能地把新的技术成果运用到新的厂矿中，这样才能使我们新建的工厂、矿山在经济上更加合理，在技术水平上更加提高。目前我们的设计人员虽然有许多已经感觉到有学习苏联先进技术理论的必要，但是还有更多的人员坚持着保守的技术理论。他们不知道以唯物辩证法为思想指导的苏联科学进步的速度，已经大大地超过了资产阶级国家所能达到的速度。在这种思想状态之下，我们的设计人员，就不可能取得技术上先进的理论，他们依然把很久以前从资产阶级国家或学校里获得的教条奉为经典。以上所举的这个冶炼厂的设计，正是表明了技术上的保守思想多么严重地影响着我们的设计人员。例如该厂的原设计，根据资本主义国家的技术标准，规定其生产能力为二千吨，但是根据苏联专家的研究，认为只要抛弃落后的技术标准而采取科学上新的成就，则在利用原有建筑条件下，只要增加少数设备就可达到一万吨的生产能力。为什么两者相差这样大呢？这是因为原设计在联带烧结机方面，采用了落后的日本标准（每一平方公尺有效面积只能烧结八吨）。如果根据先进的标准设计，则每一平方公尺有效面积的生产率将提高三倍以上。在熔矿炉方面，原设计对于风口断面所采取的落后定额，为每一平方公尺二十五吨。如果采用先进技术标准，则可达六十到一百二十吨。在吹炼方面，由于原设计传动装置的错误也就大大地限制了其本身的生产能力；在生产操作系统方面，原设计采用了落后技术标准，而没有采用现代的多层烧结炉和反射炉熔炼法。因此，苏联专家认为，只要根据新的技术成就加以改造，再增加一台烧结机及其他一小部分设备，则整个工厂的能力提高五倍是完全可能的。从这里我们就可以看到，先进的技术理论和设计人员的思想，在基本建设中有多么重要的意义了。
    还有，设计工作者对于负责设计的工厂、矿山，必须考虑各个车间与各个分厂之间的平衡，而且对于需要数年之久才能完成全部工程的大规模厂矿，还应该尽可能地考虑到各车间开始局部投入生产时，怎样求得相互间的平衡。因为只有这样才能尽量避免国家资金和物资的积压和浪费。但是我们所举的这个冶炼厂的设计者，甚至连前一种最低限度的平衡要求都没有加以慎重考虑。它所设计的选矿厂，磨矿和浮选的能力小于破碎和过滤能力几乎达到一倍左右；熔炼方面，烧结能力小于熔炉能力也达一倍；而整个选矿能力和熔炼能力又极不相称。此外，厂房设计和设备设计也不能相互适应。所有这些事实，也都说明这种设计是一个缺乏思想性的
    “拼凑”，它所造成的损失是严重的。对于这样一个新建的工厂，当它刚刚要投入生产时，国家又将不得不拨付大量资金去重新改造它！
    最后，在这项设计中，也没有注意克服资产阶级设计中不注意技术保安和劳动保护的思想，没有尽
    一切可能地考虑到劳动保护的条件。因而在建设完毕之后，技术保安上一系列的问题不能解决。例如在炼炉、吹炉的旁边，不正确地设置了水、气管道，因而在紧急的时候，如果把矿水放到车间地上时（这种现象在工作中是完全可能的），就会使水、气管道的线路发生意外故障。又如在劳动保护方面，甚至对于严重损害职工健康的硫化气体，都没有考虑怎样加以处理，使它变为无害而又有用。
    我们为什么要这样详细地分析这个冶炼厂的设计中的错误呢？因为这个设计提供了一个典型，让大家懂得，究竟什么是设计中的错误思想，这种错误思想究竟会给国家建设事业造成多严重的损害。我们要坚决反对一切缺乏正确的指导思想的“设计上的拼凑”。我们希望设计部门展开普遍的检查，揭露各种错误的设计，批判各种错误的思想。只有这样，才会给先进的设计工作开辟道路，才会使工业建设和其他基本建设不致遭受令人痛心的有时是不可挽救的损失。
