At the Crossroads of Europe
——Notes from the World People's Peace Congress

    Decadent Writer Joins the Ranks of Peace

    The attendance of French existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre at the Vienna Congress drew the attention of cultural and artistic representatives from various countries attending the congress. Although everyone knew that this congress was different from the previous two, and that the scope of unity was broader than before, few people had anticipated beforehand that a bourgeois decadent writer like Sartre could join the ranks of peace.

    This decadent writer, who was regarded as a treasure by the American imperialists after World War II and served as one of their executors of anti-peace propaganda, spoke on the second day of the congress, immediately after Joliot-Curie and Kitchlew. In his speech, in addition to calling for peace, he also touched on the nature of peace. He disagreed with the pacifists' advocacy of humiliating peace at all costs, giving up sovereignty, and he opposed peace under the threat of atomic bombs. He believed what the politicians of socialist countries said: that socialist and capitalist systems could coexist peacefully. He did not believe that people must destroy and kill others in order to feed themselves. He advocated that the People's Republic of China join the United Nations. He said: "This Chinese government has been recognized by the people of the whole country, it holds all the power of the country, it leads the national economy, and has a strong army; finally, it is on its own land. However, as far as the United States and the United Nations are concerned, it does not exist; the Chinese government they recognize is a handful of fugitives living in Washington and Success Lake." Finally, he advocated maintaining friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. His opinions won universal applause.

    After the meeting, many representatives discussed this matter. Russell, a reporter from the British "Daily Worker," said that Sartre spoke well, and he could have an impact on non-progressive intellectual masses. The American representative, Whitten, told me that Sartre's plays had been performed in New York, including one called "The Flies," which described a son falling in love with his mother. Very boring. French existentialist followers often drank and danced wildly in clubs, wearing black shirts and blue pants, with a metal chain around their necks, and a small skull model hanging on the chain.

    Dr. Yin Xun, the editor of the Austrian "People's Voice" newspaper, told me that Sartre's other play, called "Dirty Hands," not only promoted nihilism, as well as the "philosophy" of decadence and despair, but was also anti-communist. When the Austrian reactionaries learned last autumn that Sartre was going to attend the Peace Congress, they wanted to choose the same period as the opening of the congress to stage "Dirty Hands" in Vienna to sabotage him. After Sartre opposed it and warned that if the play was staged without the author's consent, the author would go to court to sue, the reactionaries had to abandon their original plan.

    Existentialism has a certain market among the distressed petty-bourgeois intellectuals in Western Europe and America. Because it is suitable for their pessimistic and despairing mood after World War II. It promotes "the only way out of life is suicide," "don't think," "there is no different position between the executioner and the victim"... This "self-destruction" and "surrenderism" philosophy is an effective poison for paralyzing young people for the bourgeois reactionaries. Therefore, the progressive literary and art circles have always firmly opposed this cosmopolitan "literary thought." The stern criticism that "existentialism is a cesspool" and "is surrenderism" often rings like an alarm bell among the young people of Western Europe and America. Fadeyev once sharply pointed out in a speech: "If jackals could write or use typewriters, they would also create like the poet Eliot or the novelist Sartre." Chilean poet Neruda believed that Fadeyev's words inevitably insulted the beasts, because he felt that even if beasts could write, they would not write such disgusting and destructive malicious thoughts.

    I met Neruda at the congress and talked about Sartre. He said that it was good that Sartre and other non-realist writers could do this, and their actions were a blow to imperialism. However, his past criticism of them was still correct, "I hope their future works can also be changed." Soviet poet Surkov also said to me, "The 'philosophy' of existentialism has developed the worst side of Dostoevsky's thought. Their support for peace is of course welcome, but we should still oppose their reactionary art."

    Jean-Paul Sartre said at the end of his speech: What divides neighbors and cousins within a country into enemies is a no-man's land, and this no-man's land is "anti-communism." He called on people to eliminate distrust and fear, then this no-man's land would be eliminated.

    I think his words can supplement what the great peace fighters often warn mankind: every time mankind stands at a crossroads, it must correctly choose the path to peace, not the path to war. Why do people often go astray and choose the path of war? I think some of them must be blocked by the "anti-communist" no-man's land, so they cannot go the path of peace.

    More and more people are walking on this road of peace. Taking the French delegation as an example, in addition to existentialists, there are surrealists and Christian Democrats, as well as non-partisan writers.

    Futile Slander and Persecution

    However, the warmongers and their lackeys still open their mouths and talk nonsense with their eyes closed. They either say that the peace movement is communist propaganda, or that it is directed by the Soviet Union. The Austrian reactionary government's newspaper published a bunch of nonsense from Graf, the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior. What kind of guy is this "important person" of the "People's" Party? Listen to his self-introduction, he once declared that he felt it was an honor to be called a fascist. He reorganized the Austrian constabulary into regular troops, and restored the fascist organization of the former Austrian "Internal Guard" in the countryside. He also fabricated that at the meeting of the Presidium of the Peace Congress, a secret agreement was decided: after the peace representatives of various countries return home this time, they should go to the military factories in their own countries to do espionage work and report the military drawings to the Soviet Union. This kind of dream talk has only one reference value, that is, the reactionaries are trying to create some excuses to persecute peace fighters.

    But neither slander nor persecution can stop the just movement. The American government issued arrest warrants for the American representatives who attended the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, but many American representatives still attended this congress. The Iraqi delegation originally had eleven people, but the government arrested six of them, but the other five representatives still overcame all difficulties to attend. The Italian government blockaded the Italian-Austrian border, but the number of Italian representatives was the largest in the congress delegation, reaching one hundred and ninety-eight people. This made the Gasperi government both annoyed and ashamed. He made a speech in Paris, complaining that other Atlantic Group countries did not abide by the agreement, kept the checkpoints, and let people go, which made the Italian government very embarrassed. Brazilian representative Branco, a winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, had just been released from prison for more than a year, but she came to the congress again to call for a stop to the war. A young man from Sudan in Africa came to Vienna despite the threat of seven years in prison. The chairman of the peace conference in Thailand, the Thai director of the World Peace Council, and many others were arrested, but the Thai delegation continued to struggle. The congress reserved fifteen seats for the Tunisian representatives, but only one representative came from Tunisia, and the rest were detained by the government, but this only Tunisian representative at the congress accused all the representatives of the dark crimes of the colonial executioners, and ruthlessly exposed the faces of the imperialists to the people of the world.

    The imperialists' brutal persecution of peace fighters only shows their growing fear of the peace movement, and cannot shake the will of the people for peace in the slightest. Some representatives said in their speeches that they would be stronger when they returned. This is undoubtedly the common wish of the nearly 2,000 representatives of the congress! (End)

    在欧洲的三岔口
    ——世界人民和平大会记事

    颓废主义作家参加和平行列
    法国存在主义作家让—保尔·萨特的出席维也纳大会，引起了出席大会的各国文化和艺术界代表们的注意。大家虽都知道，这次大会和过去两次都不同，所团结的范围比过去更加广泛，可是，人们在事前很少会想到，像萨特这样一个资产阶级颓废主义作家也能够参加到和平的行列中来。
    这位在二次大战后被美帝国主义者奉为至宝、作为他们的反对和平宣传的执行人之一的颓废主义作家，在大会开幕的次日，就紧接着约里奥—居里和克其鲁之后发言了。他在发言中除了要求和平之外，还触到和平的性质问题，他不同意和平主义者所主张的不惜一切代价、放弃主权的屈辱的和平，他反对原子弹威胁下的和平。他相信社会主义国家的政治家所说的话：社会主义和资本主义制度是可以和平共处的。他不相信人们必须破坏和杀害别人，才能自己吃饱。他主张中华人民共和国加入联合国。他说：“这个中国政府已被全国人民所承认，它手里掌握国家的全部权力，它领导全国经济，并有一支强大的军队；最后，它是在自己的国土上。可是，对美国和联合国说来，它却是不存在的；他们所承认的中国政府，是一小撮住在华盛顿和成功湖的逃亡者。最后，他主张和苏联以及人民民主国家保持友好。他的意见赢得了普遍的鼓掌。
    会后不少代表谈论这件事。英国“工人日报”记者罗塞尔说，萨特讲得不坏，他对非进步的知识群众是能够产生影响的。美国代表惠吞告诉我，萨特的剧本曾经在纽约上演过，其中有一个剧本叫“苍蝇”，内容写一个儿子爱上了他的母亲。非常无聊。法国的存在主义信徒们经常在俱乐部里酗酒狂舞，穿着黑衫蓝裤，脖子里挂一串金属链子，链子上还吊着一个小小的髑髅模型。
    奥国“人民之声”报的编者尹逊博士告诉我，萨特的另一剧本叫“脏手”，内容不仅宣传虚无主义，以及颓废和绝望的“哲学”，而且是反共的。当去年秋天，奥国反动势力得知萨特要参加和平大会后，他们就想挑选与大会开幕的同一时期，在维也纳上演“脏手”，来破坏他。经过萨特反对并警告：如果不得作者同意上演这个戏，作者要到法院去控告，反动势力才不得不放弃原来的狡计。
    存在主义在西欧和美洲的苦闷的小资产阶级知识分子当中是有一定的市场的。因为它适合于他们在第二次大战后所产生的悲观和绝望的心情。它宣传
    “人生的出路只有自杀”，“不要思想”，“刽子手和牺牲者之间没有不同的立场”……这种“自我毁灭”和“投降主义”的哲学对于资产阶级反动势力说来，是麻痹青年的有效毒物。因此，进步的文艺界从来就是坚决反对这种世界主义的“文艺思想”的。“存在主义是污水坑”，“是投降主义”的严正批评，经常像警钟一样在西欧和美洲的青年群众中敲响着。法捷耶夫在一篇演说中曾经尖锐地指出：“如果豺狼能够拿笔或者使用打字机，它们也会像诗人爱略特或者小说家萨特那样创作。”智利诗人聂鲁达认为法捷耶夫的话不免侮辱了兽类，因为他觉得即使野兽能够写作，也不会写出这种令人作呕和宣扬毁灭的恶毒思想。
    我在大会上遇到聂鲁达，谈起萨特，他表示，萨特和别的非现实主义的作家能够这样是好的，他们的行动对帝国主义是一个打击。但是，他过去对他们的批评依旧是正确的，“我希望他们将来的作品也能够有所转变。”苏联名诗人苏尔柯夫也对我说，“存在主义的‘哲学’发展了杜思妥也夫斯基的思想的最坏的一面。他们拥护和平，当然是值得欢迎的，但是我们对他们的反动艺术仍应加以反对。”
    让—保尔·萨特在结束他的发言时表示：把一国之内的邻居和表兄弟们分裂开来成为仇敌的，是一道无人区，而这道无人区就是“反共”。他号召人们消除不信任和恐惧，那么这道无人区就会跟着消除。
    我想，他的话正可以补充说明那些伟大的和平战士们所经常警告人类的话：当人类每一次站在三岔口的时候，必须正确挑选走向和平的道路，而不是战争的道路。为什么常常有人误入歧途，挑选了战争的道路呢？我想其中一定有一部分人是为了他们被“反共”的无人区所阻隔，所以不能走向和平之路。
    走在这条和平大道上的人们越来越多了，就以法国代表团而论，其中除了存在主义者外还有超现实主义者和基督教民主党以及无党派的作家。
    徒劳的诽谤和迫害
    然而战争贩子及其奴才们还要闭着眼睛信口开河。不是说和平运动是共产党的宣传，便是说它是苏联指挥的。奥地利反动政府的报纸上就登着内政部国务秘书格拉夫的一段胡言乱语。这个“人民”党的“要人”是怎样一个家伙呢？请听他的自我介绍吧，他曾经声言，他觉得被称为一个法西斯分子是一件光荣的事情。他把奥地利的宪兵改编为正规部队，并且在乡村恢复了过去奥地利的“内卫军”的法西斯组织。他还捏造说，在和平大会主席团的会议上，曾决定了一条秘密协议：各国和平代表此次回国后都要到本国的军火工厂中去做间谍工作，把军火图样报告给苏联。这种梦呓只有一点参考价值，那就是反动派企图制造一些口实，来迫害和平战士们。
    但不管是诽谤也好，迫害也好，都不能阻挡住正义的运动。美国政府对出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表下了通缉令，可是这次大会仍有不少美国代表出席。伊拉克代表团本来有十一个人，却被政府逮捕了六个，可是其他五个代表还是克服一切困难出席了。意大利政府封锁意奥边境，可是意大利代表团的人数是大会代表团中最多的，达一百九十八人。这件事弄得加斯贝利政府又恼又羞。他在巴黎发表谈话，埋怨其他大西洋集团国家没有遵守约言，把住关卡，放走了人，致使意大利政府十分尴尬。斯大林国际和平奖金获得者巴西女代表布兰柯刚坐了一年多监牢出来，但是她又到大会上来呼吁停止战争了。非洲苏丹的青年不顾七年监禁的恫吓，来到了维也纳。泰国的和平会议的主席，世界和平理事会的泰国理事等好些人被捕了，可是泰国代表团依旧继续斗争。大会给突尼斯代表留了十五个坐位，突尼斯却只来了一个代表，其余的代表被政府扣留了，可是这个唯一的突尼斯代表在大会上向全体代表控诉了殖民地刽子手的黑暗罪行，把帝国主义者的面目无情地暴露在世界人民之前。
    帝国主义者对和平战士所进行的蛮横迫害，只是说明了他们对和平运动的日益恐惧，丝毫也不能动摇和平人民的意志。有的代表在发言中说，他们回去后将更加坚强。这无疑是大会近二千位代表的共同的誓愿！（完）
