    The "Patriotic Production Clubs" in Beizaolin and Taiqu Villages, Yushe
    Zhang Jiucheng

    Editor's Note: The "Patriotic Production Club" organizations established in Beizaolin Village and Taiqu Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, are excellent. They unify the various propaganda organizations and propaganda tools in the countryside, centralize leadership, and conduct various lively propaganda activities and recreational and sports activities in a planned and regular manner. This not only enables the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, held every half-month in these villages, to be maintained regularly, strengthens patriotic education, and promotes various practical tasks; it also enlivens rural life, appropriately meets the growing cultural and entertainment needs of the masses, and strengthens physical exercise. We believe that all regions can learn from the experience of Yushe County and, after promoting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, gradually promote this good organizational form based on their own conditions.

    Since Yushe County, Shanxi Province, universally implemented the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, the political and cultural life of the rural masses has become active. On the basis of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" activities, Beizaolin Village in the first district and Taiqu Village in the fourth district have established "Patriotic Production Clubs." This kind of organization unifies all propaganda organizations and propaganda tools in the countryside, concentrates activities, and makes the content of propaganda richer and the forms more lively. Over the past year, "Patriotic Production Clubs" have been widely promoted throughout Yushe County. Through this organizational form, the county's leading cadres have enabled the masses throughout the county to regularly receive education in patriotism, collectivism, and the socialist future, greatly promoting production competition campaigns and patriotic health campaigns.

    Beizaolin Village and Taiqu Village both established Party propaganda networks, reading groups, drum storytelling teams, and other propaganda organizations during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and also established the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. The reading group in Beizaolin Village, led by propagandist Zhao Guizhong, saw an introduction about the libraries of Soviet collective farms in the Shanxi Peasant Newspaper. They initiated the establishment of a small library, raised funds to buy some popular books and cartoons for everyone to read. Later, the scale of the library gradually expanded. The library exhibited serial picture stories of typical figures in the village, and displayed self-made health models, astronomical instruments, scientific models, and various physical specimens. In addition, there were drum storytelling teams, lantern slides, murals, and other off-site activities. They called it the "Patriotic Production Club." Later, according to the experience introduced in the newspapers, the reading group mobilized everyone to add many new activities.

    Taiqu Village also had reading groups, drum storytelling teams, and small libraries. The village propagandist heard about the "Patriotic Production Club" in Beizaolin Village at the county's propagandist representative meeting. After returning to the village, they established a "Patriotic Production Club" on the basis of the library.

    The activities of the "Patriotic Production Club" are quite extensive, affecting all aspects of the masses' production, life, politics, culture, sports, health, and entertainment. Its organization is as follows: Under the leadership of the director and deputy director, there are four sections: literary and sports, blackboard newspaper broadcasting, book exhibition, and newspaper subscription and distribution. The director and heads of each section are held by members of the Party branch, Communist Youth League branch, and other village cadres. The specific work is carried out separately by propagandists and the entire village. The activities of the literary and sports section include: drum storytelling team, drama troupe, yangko dance, clapper talk, small flower opera, lantern slides, wall newspapers, cartoons, wooden horses, platforms, single bars, high jump, long jump, etc. The blackboard newspaper broadcasting section includes: blackboard newspapers, mobilization signs, patriotic signs, Q&A columns, broadcasting tubes, and other activities. The book exhibition section includes: books, newspapers, cartoons, models, instruments, and various physical specimen exhibitions. The newspaper subscription and distribution section is responsible for the ordering, distribution, storage, and management of newspapers, books, and cartoons. With a "Patriotic Production Club" in a village, all the masses in the village, regardless of gender or age, can be organized. Although the activities of each section are diverse, the content of the propaganda is unified. The Party branch inspects the work of the entire village every half month and studies the ideological situation inside and outside the Party. Based on the current tasks and the ideological situation of the masses, it determines the central content of propaganda for the next half month, and discusses what should be commended and criticized in the work of the first half month. The writing team, according to the decision of the branch and referring to the newspapers, compiles propaganda materials, which are reviewed by the branch and then supplied to each section for adoption. This kind of division of labor, responsible for centralized propaganda, is very effective.

    When Taiqu Village evaluated wheat last summer, Ning Huaibing paid attention to technology and harvested 19 dou per mu; Zhang Ruzhen did not pay attention to technology and the wheat became moldy, harvesting only 2 dou per mu. After research, the branch compiled the production facts of these two people into drum storytelling and publicized them everywhere. The two kinds of wheat were also placed in the library for physical exhibition, and Ning Huaibing was invited to explain himself. This promoted the wheat seed selection work in the whole village. At the beginning of spring plowing in Beizaolin Village, the masses did not believe in the principles of preserving fertilizer, conserving moisture, and resisting drought. The propagandists organized the masses to visit the exhibition of various soils and fertilizers, and took the opportunity to explain the scientific principles of preserving fertilizer and improving the soil. At the same time, technicians taught the techniques of preserving fertilizer and improving the soil. After the masses took action, the propagandists promptly seized the facts of Zhao Liuzhu, who preserved fertilizer well in the village, and Zhao Liuyuan, who never paid attention to preserving fertilizer, and drew them into serial pictures and made them into lantern slides. Blackboard newspapers and broadcasting tubes also commended and criticized them separately. After these activities, most of the farmers in the village paid attention to preserving fertilizer and conserving moisture. The masses reflected: With the club in our village, all work has changed. In 1951, Beizaolin Village was still a third-class village, with only one temporary mutual aid team of four households. In 1952, four long-term fixed mutual aid teams had been organized. All kinds of work are running ahead, and the third-class village has jumped to a first-class village.

    The various activities of the "Patriotic Production Club" have their own characteristics and are welcomed by the masses. The book exhibition hall is a central place for the masses to learn politics and culture. In addition to being open during "Patriotic Inspection Day" and on rainy days, it is generally open once every five or seven days. Every time Taiqu Village is open, more than a hundred people go to read books and newspapers and visit, and even old ladies in their seventies and eighties are attracted. Some read books and some look at paintings. The instructor explains the story with pictures, and the masses ask questions. Someone said: "The library is our teacher. If we don't know anything, we go and ask." The literary activities of the "Patriotic Production Club" such as drum storytelling, clapper talk, cartoons, and lantern slides are also the most popular with the masses. When Beizaolin Village mobilized women to go to the fields in summer, the propagandist Zhao Guizhong drew the serial pictures of the farm busy childcare center published in the Shanxi Daily on the white walls of the village. After the women in the village saw it, they quickly organized a farm busy childcare center. The two drum storytelling teams in Taiqu Village have a total of twenty-four people, mostly young men and women. They write, sing, and perform themselves based on the central work of each stage and the good and bad typical examples in the village. Over the past year, they have written more than forty drum lyrics. After listening to the drum storytelling, the masses reflected: "Whatever Beijing has, our village has." In the patriotic health campaign, through the propaganda of the drum storytelling team, the masses of the whole village cleaned up the dirtiest street. They proudly said: "Our village also has a new road."

    The "Q&A Column" in the "Patriotic Production Club" is one of the best ways for the masses to supervise each other's learning and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The content of the Q&A includes many aspects such as current affairs, science and technology, patriotic actions, production increase competitions, culture and health. The "Q&A Column" has a dedicated person responsible for management, supervision and inspection, and makes regular summaries. There are often fifty or sixty people participating in the "Q&A Column" in Taiqu Village. The person being asked often takes the questions to flip through books and newspapers, or finds someone to discuss and study the reply. This promotes everyone's learning of political, cultural, and production technology. The "Serial Blackboard Newspaper Network" is also a creation in the activities of the "Patriotic Production Club." Taiqu Village has sixteen blackboard newspapers, each managed by a dedicated person. The Party branch also has a large blackboard, writing the work plan for each period and its political significance. Other blackboard newspapers carry out activities around this large blackboard. The twenty-three propagandists each have a mobilization sign, writing mobilization words for the central task of each period, and carry out propaganda and mobilization work to the masses in their assigned areas at any time. Each household in the masses has a "Patriotic Sign," writing their own patriotic covenant. After each "Patriotic Inspection Day" is held and the production plan is revised within the mutual aid team, the revised patriotic covenant is written on the "Patriotic Sign." During each "Patriotic Inspection Day," each household takes their own "Patriotic Sign" to check their implementation of the patriotic covenant. In this way, the patriotic covenant truly becomes a "living covenant."

    In addition, the "Patriotic Production Club" also has a "bumper harvest platform." The planned bumper harvest land of each group and household is written on wooden boards with the place name, yield, number of cultivations, research technology, etc., and hung centrally on the "bumper harvest platform." Several propagandists are responsible for checking and announcing the implementation of the plan by each group and household at any time, and urge everyone to realize the plan. The conditions for challenges and responses from the masses in the village to the outside are also written on the wall, so that the masses can check at any time.

    Since these two villages established "Patriotic Production Clubs," the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system has become more consolidated. The masses of the whole village have places for daily political, cultural, and sports activities. In the past, after a day's work, the farmers either visited and chatted idly, or squatted at home and did not come out, and the village was lifeless; now, the club attracts everyone. The club is most lively after lunch and at night. Farmers returning from the fields, some are saying clapper talk, some are reading books and newspapers, some are learning to sing drum storytelling, some are high jumping and long jumping, turning bars, climbing platforms, and jumping wooden horses. Everyone's spirit is so happy and full. Everyone learns from each other, criticizes each other, encourages each other, and progresses much faster than before.

    榆社北枣林、台曲两村的“爱国生产俱乐部”
    张久成
    编者按：山西榆社县北枣林村和台曲村所创建的“爱国生产俱乐部”的组织是很好的。它把农村各种宣传组织和宣传工具统一起来，集中领导，有计划地经常地进行各种生动活泼的宣传活动和文娱体育活动。这不仅使这些村庄每半月举行一次的“爱国检查日”制度得以保持经常，加强了爱国主义教育，推动了各种实际工作；并且使农村生活活泼起来了，适当地满足了群众日益增长着的文化娱乐要求，加强了体格的锻炼。我们认为各地可以学习榆社县的经验，在推广“爱国检查日”制度之后，也根据自己的条件，逐步地推广这种良好的组织形式。
    山西榆社县自普遍推行“爱国检查日”制度以后，农村群众的政治生活和文化生活都活跃起来了。在“爱国检查日”活动的基础上，一区的北枣林村和四区台曲村都创建了“爱国生产俱乐部”。这种组织把农村所有宣传组织和宣传工具统一起来，集中活动，使宣传内容更加丰富，形式也活泼生动。一年来“爱国生产俱乐部”已在榆社全县普遍推广。县的领导干部通过这一组织形式，使全县群众经常地受到爱国主义、集体主义和社会主义前途的教育，大大地推动了生产竞赛运动和爱国卫生运动等工作。
    北枣林村和台曲村都在抗美援朝运动中建立了党的宣传网，成立了读报组、鼓书队等宣传组织，又建立了“爱国检查日”制度。北枣林村以宣传员赵贵中为首的读报组，在山西农民报上看到了关于苏联集体农庄的图书馆的介绍，他们就发起建立一个小型图书馆，集资买了些通俗图书和漫画等供大家阅览。后来图书馆的规模逐渐扩大，馆内展览了一些本村典型人物的连环图画，并陈列了自制的各种卫生模型和天文仪器、科学模型、各种实物标本等，另外还有鼓书队、幻灯、壁画等馆外活动。他们称它为“爱国生产俱乐部”。以后读报组根据报纸上介绍的经验，发动大家又陆续增加了许多新的活动。
    台曲村原来也有读报组、鼓书队和小型图书馆。村里的宣传员在县里的宣传员代表会议上，听了北枣林村“爱国生产俱乐部”的介绍，回村后便在图书馆的基础上，也办起了“爱国生产俱乐部”。
    “爱国生产俱乐部”的活动是相当广泛的，它影响到群众的生产、生活、政治、文化、体育、卫生、娱乐等各个方面。它的组织是：在正副主任领导下，设有文艺体育、板报广播、图书展览、报刊订发等四股。主任和各股的负责人，分由党支部、团支部的委员和其他村干部等担任，具体工作则发动宣传员和全村群众分头来作。文艺体育股的活动有：鼓书队、剧团、秧歌、快板、小花戏、幻灯、墙报、漫画、木马、平台、单人杠、跳高、跳远等。板报广播股有：黑板报、鼓动牌、爱国牌、问答栏、广播筒等活动。图书展览股有：图书、报刊、漫画、模型、仪器和各种实物标本展览。报刊订发股负责报纸、图书、漫画等订购和收发保管等工作。一村有了一个“爱国生产俱乐部”，就可以把全村的群众不分男女老少都组织进来。各股的活动形式虽属多种多样，但宣传内容是统一的。党支部每半个月检查一次全村工作和研究一次党内外思想情况。根据当前任务和群众思想情况，决定下半月宣传的中心内容，同时讨论好上半月工作中应表扬什么，批评什么。编写组根据支部决定，再参考报纸，编写出宣传材料，经支部审查后，供给各股采用。这样分工负责集中来进行宣传，收效是很大的。
    台曲村去年夏季评比小麦时，宁怀丙讲究技术，每亩收一石九斗；张如珍不讲技术霉了麦，每亩只收了二斗。支部研究后，就把这两人的生产事实，对比编成鼓书，到处宣传。又将这两种麦放在图书馆里进行实物展览，并请宁怀丙自己来作说明。这样推动了全村的小麦选种工作。北枣林村在春耕开始时，群众不相信保管肥料、保墒抗旱的道理，宣传员就组织群众参观了各种土壤和肥料的展览，乘机讲解了保管肥料和改良土壤的科学道理，同时由技术员传授了保管肥料和改良土壤的技术。群众行动起来后，宣传员又及时地抓住本村保管肥料好的赵留柱和从来不注意保管肥料的赵留元的事实，画成连环画，并制成幻灯放映。黑板报、广播筒也对他们分别进行了表扬和批评。经过这些活动后，全村农民大部分注意了保管肥料和保墒。群众反映说：俺村有了俱乐部，啥工作也变样了。一九五一年北枣林村还是三类村，全村只有一个四户的临时变工组，一九五二年已组织起四个长期定型的互助组来。各种工作都跑在前面了，三类村一跃变成了一类村。
    “爱国生产俱乐部”的各种活动，各有特点，都为群众所欢迎。图书展览馆是群众学习政治与文化的集中场所。除了在举行“爱国检查日”时和下雨天开馆外，平时一般是每隔五天或七天开馆一次。台曲村每次开馆总有百余人去阅读书报和参观，连七八十岁的老太太也吸引来了。有的看书，有的看画。说明员指图说事，群众问长问短。有人说：“图书馆是咱的先生，啥不知道了，就去问问。”“爱国生产俱乐部”的鼓书、快板、漫画、幻灯等文艺活动，也是最受群众欢迎的。北枣林村夏季发动妇女下地时，宣传员赵贵中把山西日报上登的农忙托儿所连环画，画在本村的白墙上，村内妇女看了以后，很快就组织起了农忙托儿所。台曲村的两个鼓书队，共有二十四人，多是青年男女。她们根据各段中心工作，结合本村好坏典型事例，自编自唱自演。一年来编写了四十多个鼓词。群众听了鼓书后反映说：“北京有啥，俺村有啥。”在爱国卫生运动中，经过鼓书队的宣传，全村群众把一条最肮脏的街道也收拾得干干净净了。他们骄傲地说：“俺村也有新开路了。”
    “爱国生产俱乐部”中的“问答栏”，是群众相互间督促学习和开展批评与自我批评最好的方式之一。问答内容，包括时事政治、科学技术、爱国行动、增产竞赛、文化卫生等许多方面。“问答栏”设有专人负责管理和督促检查，定期作总结。台曲村经常参加“问答栏”的有五、六十人。被问的人经常拿上问题翻书翻报，或找人讨论，研究答复。这样就促进了大家对政治、文化和生产技术的学习。“连环板报网”，也是“爱国生产俱乐部”活动中的创造。台曲村有十六块黑板报，每块有专人管理。党支部另有一块大黑板，写着每个时期工作的计划和它的政治意义。其他黑板报都围绕这块大黑板进行活动。二十三个宣传员各有一块鼓动牌，写着各个时期中心任务的鼓动词，在自己分工的地区随时向群众进行宣传鼓动工作。群众每家各有一块“爱国牌”，写着自家的爱国公约。每次举行了“爱国检查日”和互助组内修订了生产计划之后，就把修订后的爱国公约写在“爱国牌”上。在每次过“爱国检查日”时，各家拿上自家的“爱国牌”去检查自己执行爱国公约情况。这样，爱国公约真正成为“活公约”了。
    另外，“爱国生产俱乐部”还有一个“丰产台”。各组各户计划中的丰产地，分别用木板写上地名、产量、耕作次数、研究技术等，集中挂在“丰产台”上。由几个宣传员负责，随时检查、宣布各组各户执行计划的情况，督促大家实现计划。村内群众向外边挑战应战的条件，也写在墙上，以便群众随时对照检查。
    这两个村自建立“爱国生产俱乐部”以后，“爱国检查日”制度更加巩固了。全村群众有了日常进行政治、文化、体育等活动的场所。过去农民们在一天劳动之后，不是串门子闲聊天，就是蹲在家里不出来，村里死气沉沉；现在，俱乐部把每个人都吸引去了。每当午饭后和夜晚，俱乐部最热闹，从田里回来的农民，有的说快板、有的看书报，有的学唱鼓书，有的跳高跳远，翻杠子、爬平台、跳木马。每个人的精神都是那样的愉快和饱满。大家互相学习，互相批评，互相鼓励，进步比以前快多了。
