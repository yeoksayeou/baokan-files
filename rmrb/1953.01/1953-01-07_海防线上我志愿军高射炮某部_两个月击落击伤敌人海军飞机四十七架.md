Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th. The anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteers, guarding the coastline, have dealt a heavy blow to enemy aircraft taking off from aircraft carriers. In the past two months, a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of our army shot down and damaged 47 enemy aircraft. Most of the twelve enemy aircraft shot down crashed on the coast, most of the pilots were killed, and some were captured.

The enemy's naval aircraft adopted bombing tactics of concentrated and continuous attacks with a large number of aircraft. Our anti-aircraft artillery units launched heroic and tenacious battles against the numerous enemy aircraft. In mid-November of last year, our anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding a bridge in a certain area engaged in three fierce battles in succession with a large number of enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, who dared not come to provoke again. The first battle took place on November 15th last year. On that day, more than 30 enemy aircraft flew in, and one was shot down by our fierce anti-aircraft fire while diving. The next day, the number of enemy aircraft increased to more than 80, and our anti-aircraft artillery units resolutely fought back, damaging three more enemy aircraft. Six days later, the enemy sent a total of 77 fighter planes and bombers in an attempt to carry out retaliatory bombing. Our heroic anti-aircraft gunners aimed at the enemy's lead plane and opened fire suddenly, shooting down the lead plane, and then shooting down two enemy planes following behind. The battle was very fierce that day, lasting for one hour. Although the enemy planes dropped a large number of bombs and napalm bombs on our positions and the surrounding hillsides, the heroic anti-aircraft gunners continued to calmly and fiercely attack the enemy. In this fierce battle, a total of six enemy aircraft were shot down and seven enemy aircraft were damaged.

The powerful anti-aircraft fire on our coastline has forced the enemy aircraft flying from warships to dare not fly low. According to prisoners, there is now a saying circulating among enemy naval aircraft pilots: "If you see the Communist army's anti-aircraft fire, fly high and escape quickly, or you won't be able to fly back."

    海防线上我志愿军高射炮某部
    两个月击落击伤敌人海军飞机四十七架
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】中国人民志愿军守卫在海防线上的高射炮部队，沉重地打击了从航空母舰上起飞的敌机。我军高射炮某部在最近的两个月中就击落击伤敌机四十七架。其中被击落的十二架敌机大多数坠落在海岸上，驾驶员多数丧命，有的被俘掳。
    敌人海军飞机采取了集中大量飞机进行连续攻击的轰炸活动。我军高射炮部队向数量众多的敌机展开了英勇顽强的战斗。守卫某地一座桥梁的我军高射炮部队在去年十一月中旬与数量众多的敌机连续进行了三次激烈的战斗，使敌机蒙受重大损失，再不敢前来寻衅。第一次战斗发生在去年十一月十五日。这天三十多架敌机飞来，有一架在俯冲时被我猛烈的高射炮火打落了下来。第二天，敌机增加到八十多架，我高射炮部队坚决迎击，又击伤敌机三架。过了六天，敌人又派来了战斗机、轰炸机等共七十七架，妄图进行报复性的轰炸。我英雄的高射炮兵瞄准敌人的领航机猛然开火，把一架领航机击落，接着又把跟在领航机后面的两架敌机也打了下来。这天战斗很激烈，历时达一小时，虽然敌机在我阵地上和阵地周围的山坡上投下了大批炸弹和凝固汽油弹，但是英勇的高射炮兵仍继续沉着地痛击敌人。这一场激战共击落敌机六架，击伤敌机七架。
    我海防线上的强大高射炮火，已迫使军舰上飞来的敌机不敢低飞。据俘虏说，现在敌人海军飞机驾驶员中流传着这样一句话：“发现共军高射炮火要飞得高，逃得快，迟一步就飞不回来了。”
