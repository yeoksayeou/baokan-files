Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: The Asian Socialist Conference, which opened on January 6th in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, concluded on January 15th. With the exception of the opening ceremony, almost all of the meetings were held in secret. Representatives from the Socialist parties of Burma, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria attended the conference, as did representatives from the Malayan Labour Party and the left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party. These included U Ba Swe of Burma, Narayan of India, Sjahrir of Indonesia, Mosaburo Suzuki of the left-wing Japanese Socialist Party, and Komakichi Matsuoka of the right-wing party. Observers included Clement Attlee and Paul Ross of the British Labour Party, André Philip, representing the French Left Socialist Party, the Yugoslav fascist gang representatives Djilas and Bebler, and representatives from socialist parties in several African colonial countries. Also attending as an observer was Defrère, the Asian representative of the American Federation of Labor, a tool of American monopoly capital. At the opening ceremony on the 6th, the conference elected two representatives from Asian Socialist parties—U Ba Swe of Burma and Moshe Sharett of Israel—to preside over the meeting. In both of these countries, the Socialist parties are the ruling parties.

The convening of the Asian Socialist Conference is closely related to Britain's instigation. The presence of Clement Attlee, a prominent defender of British capitalism and colonialism, as a "observer" at the conference illustrates this point. As early as December 15th of last year, before Attlee departed for Burma, the British official propaganda organ, the British Information Services, published a lengthy dispatch stating that the British side was "extremely interested" in the convening of this conference. "Attlee's decision to personally attend the Rangoon conference significantly illustrates this interest." The dispatch then proceeded to tirelessly tout Attlee's important position in Britain, saying that his importance was second only to Prime Minister Churchill; it boasted that Attlee was skilled in implementing "socialism" and that he had "accumulated a wealth of experience worthy of emulation." According to reports from American and British bourgeois news agencies, the reason the British ruling group was so interested in the Rangoon conference was that it hoped that through Attlee's direct guidance, it could organize the various socialist parties in Asia and directly place them under the control of the "Socialist International." At the same time, by using some extremely hypocritical slogans such as "opposing the colonial system" and "opposing capitalism," it could conceal their true essence of opposing the national and democratic liberation movements of the Asian peoples and "opposing communism." In this way, it would consolidate the colonial rule of British and American imperialism in many Asian countries and ease the increasingly rising struggle of the people of these countries against imperialist enslavement.

However, despite Attlee's use of various conspiracies at the conference, and despite the Yugoslav fascist clowns' frenzied cries of vicious anti-Soviet and anti-communist slanders, sharp contradictions still arose between the right-wing elements of the socialist parties of many colonial countries and the socialist party members of the imperialist countries and their few supporters. The discussion of many important issues yielded no results. On the issue of the relationship between the Asian Socialist Organization and the European Socialist Organization, the opinion of Attlee and the representatives of the European "Socialist International" that the "Asian Socialist Conference" should become a subordinate body of the "Socialist International" and "closely cooperate" with it "caused fierce debate" at the conference (Kyodo News). The conference finally passed a resolution establishing an "Asian Socialist Executive Bureau" that did not belong to the "Socialist International," but announced that it would "maintain contact" with the former.

At a public meeting held in Rangoon on January 11th, despite Attlee's loud calls for the Asian people to "cooperate" with the imperialists who enslaved them, that is, the so-called "peaceful cooperation between European and Asian peoples," "his call was only supported by Mohammed Sopiee of the Pan-Malayan Labour Party" (United Press). As a result, even Attlee himself could not help but admit that the goals he had hoped for from the Asian Socialist Conference had met with a shameful failure. He admitted at a public meeting of a small group on the 14th that he was disappointed that the representatives at the meeting each delivered "self-righteous" speeches without putting forward "constructive" suggestions. In another answer to reporters' questions, Attlee also said that the Rangoon conference would not have any direct impact on the Asian political situation.

The conference closed hastily after passing some vague and deceptive resolutions. These resolutions put forward some vote-winning phrases such as abolishing capitalism and feudalism, but at the same time emphasized opposition to communism and demanded that the Asian people accept European social democracy, which had long been bankrupt and proven to be a tool of monopoly capital. It can be predicted that the reactionary resolutions passed by the Asian Socialist Conference under the influence of Attlee, Philip, and the Yugoslav fascists, disguised with deceptive phrases, will not have any impact among the people of Asian countries, and will arouse fierce opposition from upright people in the socialist parties of Asian countries.

### “亚洲社会党会议”草草结束

    “亚洲社会党会议”草草结束
    【新华社二十日讯】一月六日在缅甸首都仰光举行的亚洲社会党会议，已于一月十五日结束。这次会议除开幕式外，几乎全是秘密举行的。参加这次会议的有缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、以色列、黎巴嫩、叙利亚的社会党的代表，有马来亚工党的代表和日本左派及右派社会党的代表，其中包括缅甸的宇巴瑞，印度的纳拉扬，印尼的沙利尔，日本左派社会党的铃木茂三郎，右派社会党的松冈驹吉。列席会议的有英国工党首领艾德礼和保罗·罗斯，法国左翼社会党代表安德烈·毕德，南斯拉夫法西斯匪帮的代表德热拉斯、贝勃勒以及若干非洲殖民地国家的社会党的代表。列席会议的还有美国垄断资本御用的工具——美国劳工联合会驻亚洲的代表德弗拉尔。在六日开幕式中，会议推举了两个亚洲国家社会党的代表——缅甸的宇巴瑞和以色列的摩西·夏里特主持会议。在这两个国家中，社会党都是执政党。
    亚洲社会党会议的召开，和英国的策动有密切的关系。英国的资本主义与殖民制度的显赫辩士艾德礼之亲自“列席”会议，说明了这一点。早在艾德礼动身到缅甸之前，英国官方宣传机关英国新闻处即曾在去年十二月十五日发表一则长篇电讯说：英国方面对于这次会议的召开，“极感兴趣。艾德礼决定亲自参加仰光会议，就显著地说明这种兴趣。”该电接着即不惮烦地吹嘘艾德礼在英国的重要地位，说他的重要性仅次于首相邱吉尔；吹嘘艾德礼是实施“社会主义”的能手，说他“积累了丰富的经验足资借镜”。根据美英资产阶级通讯社的报道可以看出：英国统治集团对仰光会议之所以如此感到兴趣，是因为它希望经过艾德礼这次的直接导演，能把亚洲各国形形色色的社会党组织起来，直接置于“社会党国际”的控制之下，同时并打着某些极端虚伪的“反对殖民制度”、“反对资本主义”的欺骗口号，来掩盖他们反对亚洲各国人民争取民族、民主解放运动和“反对共产主义”的真正本质，这样来巩固英美帝国主义在许多亚洲国家中的殖民统治，缓和这些国家人民日益高涨的反对帝国主义奴役的斗争。
    然而，尽管艾德礼在会议中使用种种阴谋手段，尽管南斯拉夫的法西斯小丑在会议中狂叫恶毒的反苏、反共诽谤，但参加会议的许多殖民地国家的社会党右翼分子和帝国主义国家的社会党分子及其少数支持者之间，仍发生了尖锐的矛盾。许多重要问题的讨论都没有什么结果。在亚洲社会党组织与欧洲社会党组织的关系问题上，艾德礼和欧洲“社会党国际”的代表们所坚持的“亚洲社会党会议”应成为“社会党国际”的下属机构并和它“密切合作”的意见，在会议中“引起激烈的争论”。（共同社）会议最后通过了设立一个不属于“社会党国际”的
    “亚洲社会党执行局”，但宣布与前者“保持联系”。
    在一月十一日在仰光举行的公开会议上，尽管艾德礼大声疾呼，要求亚洲人民和奴役他们的帝国主义者“合作”，即所谓“欧洲和亚洲人民和平合作”，但是“他的号召仅得到泛马来亚工党穆罕默德·索彼的支持”，（合众社）。由于这样，连艾德礼本人也不能不承认，他所期望于亚洲社会党会议的目标，已遭到可耻的失败。他十四日在一个小组的公开会议中承认：他对代表们在会上各自发表“自以为是”的演说而没有提出“建设性”的建议，表示失望。艾德礼在另外一次答复记者问题时，又说：仰光会议对于亚洲政治局势不会有什么直接的影响。
    会议在通过了一些空泛的、欺骗性的决议后，草草闭幕。这些决议提出了一些笼络人心的废除资本主义、封建主义之类的辞句，但同时却强调反对共产主义，并要求亚洲人民接受早已破产、并且证明是垄断资本的工具的欧洲社会民主主义。可以预料，亚洲社会党会议在艾德礼、毕德和南斯拉夫法西斯分子影响下通过的用骗人辞句伪装起来的反动决议，将不能在亚洲各国人民中产生任何影响，并将激起亚洲各国社会党中正直的人士的激烈反对。
