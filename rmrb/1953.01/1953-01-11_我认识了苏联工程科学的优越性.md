    I Recognized the Superiority of Soviet Engineering Science
    Wang Zunming, Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University

    Over the past four years, Soviet engineering science has broadened my horizons and helped me overcome many difficulties in my work.

    Around the beginning of 1949, when I visited factories in the Northeast, I bought several books and magazines published in the Soviet Union. One of them was "Improved Malleable Cast Iron" written by Torobanov. At that time, I had done some work on nodular cast iron, so I was particularly interested in books on this subject. After returning to Beijing, I read Torobanov's booklet and was deeply attracted by its rich content and concise writing style. In the past, I had read the American so-called authoritative work "American Malleable Cast Iron." This book was 367 pages long, and the words were filled with advertising-style exaggerated claims, but it said very little about the melting method, microstructure, and improvement paths of malleable cast iron. In addition, it included 96 pages of tables that were almost unrelated to malleable cast iron, which increased the thickness of the book. Torobanov's work, although only 75 pages long, systematically pointed out the position of malleable cast iron in industry and elaborated on production methods, chemical composition, microstructure, etc.

    Since then, Soviet engineering science books and newspapers have given me great inspiration. Here are two examples.

    First, let's talk about nodular cast iron work. In ordinary cast iron, graphite is in flake form, and the continuity of the matrix is divided, so the finished product is fragile. Nodular cast iron is specially treated so that graphite becomes spherical during solidification, so the finished product is strong and tough. Chinese nodular cast iron workers learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and increased the strength of cast iron by five to ten times, and improved the toughness of cast iron. In terms of product performance and operating methods, several items have exceeded the highest records of factories in capitalist countries. These achievements are indeed a contribution to the industrial development of New China.

    The brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in nodular cast iron led several factories in our country out of the maze, while publications in capitalist countries spread many harmful smokescreens to us. The American imperialist magazine "The Foundry" once frightened everyone, saying that to manufacture nodular cast iron, it is necessary to use spheroidizing agents (ie, magnesium alloys); and spheroidizing agents are extremely fierce and dangerous. But the fact is not so. Today, many factories in our country, with the help of the Soviet Union, have mastered the method of using spheroidizing agents, and there is peace and tranquility in the operation process. The lies of the American bourgeoisie were shattered. As for the Soviet factories, they have long been proficient in the method of using magnesium alloys as spheroidizing agents (as early as 1941, the Soviet Union had already used pure magnesium in cast iron, at least seven years earlier than capitalist countries). Using pure magnesium in cast iron is hundreds of times fiercer than magnesium alloys. The temperature of liquid cast iron is 1200-1300 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point of magnesium is 1110 degrees. Magnesium is the magnesium in flash photography, and it is also the magnesium used in incendiary bombs. If pure magnesium is pressed into molten iron, a series of sounds will be emitted from the molten iron in an instant, constantly lifting waves as high as two zhang, and in the dazzling light, the waves will be scattered into red-hot iron rain. At that time, the fine powder of magnesium oxide formed a white mist, and the red-hot iron rain passed through the white mist and sprinkled down. In the Soviet Union, due to the perfect safety equipment, mechanical magnesium addition is used to limit the waves and iron rain to a certain space, which does not hurt people or lose molten iron. This is something that engineers in capitalist countries cannot do, and only Soviet engineers with a very high level of thought and technology can do it.

    In the development work of nodular cast iron, Soviet experts have given us great help. For example, steelmaking expert Comrade Dimitrov assisted factories in various parts of our country in smelting high-grade steel, insisting on working day and night beside the steelmaking furnace.

    In the development of nodular cast iron, the first type of thing that often gave me great help were the reports of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Foundry Magazine, and Mechanical Engineering Bulletin (which have published dozens of articles on nodular cast iron). The second category is Soviet works on gray cast iron, malleable cast iron, and cast steel. In essence, nodular cast iron is gray cast iron with graphite in a spherical shape, malleable cast iron obtained at very high speeds, and cast steel containing spherical graphite. Nodular cast iron is a very new thing, but people have used gray cast iron, malleable cast iron, and cast steel for thousands of years. We have learned a lot of knowledge from the Soviet literature on gray cast iron, malleable cast iron, and cast steel, and gradually improved nodular cast iron.

    Secondly, in teaching work, Soviet textbooks have given me great help. Although I have taught metallography and heat treatment for more than ten years (this is a course that discusses the composition, internal structure, properties, and uses of steel, copper, aluminum, etc. It is the basic knowledge for industrial majors to use or manufacture the above-mentioned metals and alloys), I have always been troubled by not being able to find good textbooks. For example, "Metallography and Heat Treatment of Steel" written by Soffel was considered a very good book in capitalist countries more than a decade ago. But how can it escape the shackles of the capitalist system? Therefore, the 1935 edition did not collect the latest information at that time. After more than ten years, until now, bourgeois publishing companies are still unwilling to revise it. Therefore, its content is extremely outdated, and the arrangement of chapters is already unreasonable. If it is used as a textbook, it is not only poor in content, but also very difficult to teach. Other books written by Doane, Van Vlack, Hull, etc. are even simpler and more general. The fifth edition of "Steel and Its Heat Treatment" written by Burns et al. was printed in 1948, in three volumes, and bourgeois scholars once called it "the most complete collection." What is the fact? It is just a collection of articles from various American magazines, and the content is extremely chaotic. It has neither atomic arrangement nor systematic introduction of phase diagrams. Therefore, I have never been able to adopt any of them as textbooks.

    Now, we have obtained Soviet textbooks, such as "Metallography" written by Gunaev, which is rich in content and concise in writing. The first few pages of the book pointed out for which professions this book is written and what role metallography and heat treatment play in the entire national economy. Starting from the basic theories of physics and chemistry, Gunaev closely links with the practical problems of the factory and appropriately explains the atomic arrangement, phase diagram, and machining. The chapter on iron-carbon alloys not only elaborates on the basic structure of steel and cast iron, but also summarizes the types and applications of steel and cast iron. The content of the chapters on heat treatment and alloy steel is even more outstanding. Taking alloy steel as an example, based on decades of experience, people should be able to give them an appropriate evaluation, that is, to evaluate their merits from different uses. However, publications in capitalist countries have never clearly listed their advantages and disadvantages, as if several alloy steels are indistinguishable. Moreover, their publications on engineering science often deceive readers. For example, the largest American steel company, American Steel Corporation, in its annual handbook, has described the non-existent advantages of its copper steel for seven consecutive years. However, Gunaev's book clearly explains the properties and applications of alloy steel. Of course, he will not and cannot favor any one steel, nor does he depreciate any steel. He pointed out that in some cases, carbon steel performs better than alloy steel. Gunaev also talked about non-ferrous alloys. He did not neglect any useful alloys. This seems very common; but in publications in capitalist countries, it is very different. For example, "Copper and Copper Alloys" written by Wilkins et al. hardly mentioned the rather important copper-nickel alloy, because the American company that hired them did not produce nickel. Now, we use Soviet textbooks as a blueprint, and at the same time opened several classes and wrote lecture notes. The content is richer than before, but the work is easier than before.

    In the past, because there were no suitable textbooks, I could only barely put together some more reliable materials before class as teaching materials. This was a distressing thing. I had to rummage through capitalist countries' books and newspapers to find some materials; in addition, I had to do proofreading work. This made me exhausted and left me with no energy to write lecture notes. Now, I only need to spend half the effort as before to prepare my own teaching materials.

    Of course, reading Soviet engineering science books and newspapers is not an easy task, which requires us to first understand Russian. But as long as we have enthusiasm, it is not difficult to learn Russian. Several other comrades who work with me have obtained the ability to read Russian professional books by using the method of intensive study. They have been able to compile lecture notes based on Soviet textbooks and prepare courses on foundry and heat treatment respectively.

    The superiority of Soviet engineering science is not limited to the above points. In other aspects, it also far exceeds the level reached by capitalist countries. The Soviet Union today is our tomorrow. All engineering technicians and teachers in higher industrial schools should catch up quickly, learn from the Soviet Union, and improve our scientific and technological level.

    我认识了苏联工程科学的优越性
    清华大学机械制造系教授  王遵明
    四年来，苏联的工程科学扩大了我的眼界，帮助我度过了工作中的许多困难。
    大约是一九四九年的年初，我到东北去参观工厂时，买到了几本苏联出版的书籍和杂志。其中有一本是托罗巴诺夫写的“改进了的可锻铸铁”。那时我在球墨铸铁方面，曾做过一些工作，所以特别关心这方面的书籍。回到北京后，我翻阅托罗巴诺夫的小册子，深为它的丰富内容和简明笔法所吸引。过去，我读过美国的所谓权威著作“美国可锻铸铁”，这本书共三百六十七页，字里行间充满着广告式的浮夸说法，而对可锻铸铁的熔制方法、显微组织和改进的道路，却说得很少。此外，它附载了许多和可锻铸铁几乎无关的表格九十六页，这样就增加了这本书的厚度。托罗巴诺夫的著作，虽然只有七十五页，但是它系统地指明了可锻铸铁在工业上的地位，并阐述了生产方法、化学成分、显微组织，等等。
    从那时起，苏联工程科学书报便给了我很大的启示。这里举两个例子来说说。
    先说球墨铸铁工作。普通铸铁里，石墨成片状，因其基体的连续受到分割，所以成品脆弱。球墨铸铁则经过了特殊的处理，在凝固的时候，石墨成了球状，故成品强韧。中国的球墨铸铁工作者学习了苏联的先进经验，把铸铁的力量提高了五倍到十倍，并提高了铸铁的韧性；在成品的性能和操作方法等方面，若干项已超出了资本主义国家工厂的最高纪录。这些成果，对新中国的工业发展的确是一个贡献。
    苏联在球墨铸铁方面的光辉成就，将我国若干工厂引出了迷途，而资本主义国家的出版物，却对我们散布了许多有害的烟雾。美帝国主义的“铸工”杂志，曾吓唬大家说：制造球墨铸铁，必须使用球化剂（即镁合金）；而球化剂凶猛极了，危险得很。事实却不然，今天，我国许多工厂，借助于苏联的帮助，已经掌握了使用球化剂的方法，在操作过程中，平静无事。美国资产阶级的谎言被粉碎了。至于苏联的工厂，老早就精通了以镁合金做球化剂的方法（远在一九四一年以前，苏联就已经在铸铁里使用纯镁了，早于资本主义国家至少七年）。使用纯镁于铸铁，比镁合金凶猛数百倍。液体铸铁的温度，是摄氏一千二三百度，而镁的沸点是一千一百一十度。镁，就是镁光照像的镁，也就是用于燃烧弹的镁。倘将纯镁压入铁水，转瞬间从铁水中发出一连串的响声，不断地掀起高达二丈的浪花，在刺目的强光里，浪花散成赤热的铁雨，那时氧化镁的细粉形成了白雾，这赤热的铁雨就穿过白雾撒下。在苏联，操作时因有完善的保安装备，用机械加镁，将浪花和铁雨限制于一定的空间，既不伤人，也不损失铁水。这是资本主义国家的工程师所办不到的，只有具备极高度思想水平和技术水平的苏联工程师才能做到。
    在球墨铸铁的发展工作中，苏联专家曾给我们以很大的帮助。例如炼钢专家吉米特诺夫同志，曾协助我国各地工厂冶炼高级钢，在炼钢炉旁日夜坚持工作。
    在发展球墨铸铁的工作中，经常给我以巨大帮助的，第一类是苏联科学院报告、铸工杂志、机械制造通报（上面曾发表过几十篇关于球墨铸铁的文章）。第二类是苏联关于灰口铸铁、可锻铸铁、铸钢的著作。从本质上来说，球墨铸铁就是石墨形成球状的灰口铸铁、以极高速度得到的可锻铸铁，也即是包含球状石墨的铸钢。球墨铸铁是很新的事物，但人们使用灰口铸铁、可锻铸铁、铸钢已有千百年的历史了。从苏联关于灰口铸铁、可锻铸铁、铸钢的文献中，我们曾吸取了很多的知识。逐步改进了球墨铸铁。
    其次，在教学工作方面，苏联教科书给予我以很大的帮助。我虽然教过十几年的金相及热处理（这是一门讨论钢铁、铜、铝等成分及其内部组织、性能和用途的功课，它是工科专业使用或制造上列金属和合金的基础知识），但我一直为找不到好的教科书而苦恼。如索佛尔写的“钢铁的金相及热处理”，十几年前在资本主义国家算是一本顶好的书。但它怎能脱出资本主义制度的束缚呢？所以一九三五年版就没有收集当时最新的资料。又经十余年，一直到现在，资产阶级的出版公司还不愿将它改版。因此，它的内容固极陈旧，在章节的排列上也早就是不合理的了。倘用它做教本，不仅内容贫乏，而且教时也很吃力。他如杜恩、凡弗尔梯、赫尔等人写的书，内容更是简单、空泛。布伦斯等写的“钢及其热处理”第五版，于一九四八年印出，共三册，资产阶级学者曾称它为“最完全的结集”。事实怎样呢？它只是把美国各种杂志上的文章集合在一起，内容极为杂乱，它既没有原子排列，也没有相图等的系统介绍。所以，我一直无法采取它们中的任何一本作为教科书。
    现在，我们得到了苏联的教科书，如谷那叶夫写的“金相学”，内容丰富，文章简洁。该书的最初几页，就指出了本书是为那些专业写的，金相及热处理在整个国民经济里起那些作用。谷那叶夫从物理和化学的基础理论出发，紧密地联系着工厂的实际问题，恰当地说明了原子排列、相图、和机械加工。关于铁碳合金的一章，不仅阐述了钢和铸铁的基本组织，并综述了钢和铸铁的种类和应用，热处理和合金钢两章的内容，更显得出色。以合金钢为例，根据数十年来的经验，人们应该能够给它们以恰当的评价，即从不同的用途评定其高下。但是资本主义国家的出版物，始终没有清楚地列举它们的优点、劣点，仿佛几种合金钢是不分高下的。而且它们的有关工程科学的出版物，还常常欺骗读者。如美帝国主义最大的美国钢公司，在它每年刊行的手册里，连续七年描写着它的铜钢的并不存在的优点。但谷那叶夫的书，纲领分明地说明了合金钢的性质和应用。当然他不会也不可能偏袒那一种钢，他也不贬损任何一种钢。他指出在有些情况下，碳钢比合金钢表现得好。谷那叶夫还谈到了有色合金。他没有忽略任何有些用处的合金。这一点看来似乎很平常；可是在资本主义国家的出版物里，就大不相同了。例如魏尔金斯等写的“铜和铜合金”，几乎没有提到相当重要的铜镍合金，原因是雇用他们的美国公司不出产镍。现在，我们以苏联教科书为蓝本，同时开了几班，写了讲义，内容比以往充实，工作却比以往轻松了。
    从前因为没有适当的教科书，我只能在上课前勉强凑些比较可靠的材料，作为教材。这是一件令人苦恼的事，我必须翻遍资本主义国家的书报，才能找到一些材料；此外，还要进行校勘的工作。这就弄得我精疲力尽，再无余力来写讲义了。现在，我只要花只及以往一半的精力，就可以准备好自己的教材。
    自然，阅读苏联工程科学书报，并不是一件轻而易举的事，这要求我们首先要懂得俄文。但只要我们有热情，学习俄文是不难的。和我一起工作的其他几位同志就是用突击学习的方法，获得了阅读俄文专业书籍的能力的。他们已能根据苏联教科书编写讲义，分别准备铸工和热处理的课程。
    苏联工程科学的优越处，并不仅仅限于上述几点。在其他方面同样远远地超出资本主义国家所达到的水平。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。一切工程技术人员和高等工业学校的教师，应该急起直追，向苏联学习，以提高我们的科学技术水平。
