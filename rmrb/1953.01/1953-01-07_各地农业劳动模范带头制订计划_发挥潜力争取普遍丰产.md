    Agricultural Labor Models in Various Regions Take the Lead in Formulating Plans
    Exploiting Potential and Striving for Universal Bumper Harvests
    [By Our Newspaper] The agricultural labor models in various regions who have been rewarded with patriotic bumper harvest awards by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and the mutual aid and cooperative organizations they lead, based on the bumper harvests of 1952, are taking the lead in formulating production plans for this year and the next three to five years, preparing to vigorously exploit the potential of agricultural production and strive for universal bumper harvests.
    The agricultural production cooperative led by Han En, an agricultural labor model in Jilin Province, has already formulated a five-year construction plan from 1952 to 1956, developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry simultaneously, requiring a doubling of grain production within five years. Li Shunda, an agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province, led all the farmers in Xigou Village, Pingshun County, his hometown, in formulating a three-year construction plan from 1952 to 1954. The Li Shunda Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative has also specifically formulated a production plan for the first quarter of 1953. They are learning from the Soviet Union's experience in building mountainous areas and beginning efforts in agricultural basic construction. Before the New Year, when Shanxi Province held a representative conference of agricultural bumper harvest labor models, cotton bumper harvest models Qu Yaoli from Jiexian County, Wu Chun'an from Yicheng County, Yao Wenzhang from Jiangxian County, and Liu Haiyue from Yuxian County formulated production plans and jointly launched a challenge to cotton-planting farmers throughout the province. They guaranteed that in 1953, the area of bumper harvest cotton in irrigated land would be three times larger than in 1952, with an average yield of 1,000 to 1,500 catties per mu; the area of bumper harvest cotton in dry land would also be more than doubled, with an average yield of 550 to 1,000 catties per mu; and they would drive a 30% to 35% increase in cotton production in their villages, and a 20% to 30% increase in cotton production in the 34 surrounding administrative villages.
    The experience of national agricultural bumper harvests in 1952 shows that there is tremendous potential in China's agricultural production; as long as we organize and vigorously promote advanced experience and agricultural science and technology, we can unleash this enormous potential and achieve universal bumper harvests.
    In 1952, among the well-known agricultural labor models and the mutual aid and cooperative organizations they led throughout the country, with the exception of a few, such as Shi Anfu, Chen Yongkang, and Geng Changsuo, whose crops suffered reduced yields due to special reasons, and a few others who did not complete their high-yield production plans, most of them achieved remarkable bumper harvest results. The Li Shunda Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Shanxi Province harvested an average of 442 catties of grain per mu on 173 mu of autumn land, exceeding the production increase plan by 4.5% and exceeding the local average yield by 110%. The Yu Hongren Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liaodong Province harvested an average yield of 1,120 catties per mu on 19.5 mu of single-season rice. Under their leadership and influence, even more bumper harvest models emerged in 1952. It is estimated that the number of those reaching the central Ministry of Agriculture's bumper harvest award standards will exceed last year's by more than tenfold. Deng Guangjin of Liling County, Hunan Province, created a new record of 1,650.75 catties per mu of double-cropping rice. Xue Chenyou of Xiuwu County, Henan Province, created a new record of 880 catties per mu of winter wheat in irrigated land. Yang Maoyuan of Hami County, Xinjiang Province, created a new record of 1,040 catties per mu of spring wheat in irrigated land. The Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, created a new record of 1,021.3 catties per mu of cotton in irrigated land.
    In 1952, under the education and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, agricultural labor models in various regions first and foremost further organized themselves. Many agricultural labor models who were originally working individually took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams; many agricultural labor models who originally led mutual aid teams also upgraded their mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives when conditions were ripe. For example, Xu Guirong and his mutual aid team, who were awarded the titles of "Special Agricultural Labor Model of Zhejiang Province" and "Model Mutual Aid Team of Zhejiang Province" in 1951, further tried to establish an agricultural production cooperative in 1952 under the direct cultivation of the Chengling District Committee of the CCP Xin'an County, greatly increasing production. In 1951, the average yield of rice per mu for the entire team was 520 catties, with a maximum yield of 800 catties; in 1952, the average yield of rice per mu for the entire cooperative reached 750 catties, with a maximum yield of 1,060 catties per mu. Under the influence of the Xu Guirong Agricultural Production Cooperative, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Chengling District has flourished.
    On the basis of further organization, well-known agricultural labor models in various regions initiated and participated in large-scale patriotic bumper harvest movements, using their technology and advanced experience to guide the broad masses of farmers to unleash the potential of agricultural production and universally increase the yield per unit area. Qu Yaoli, a cotton bumper harvest model in Jiexian County, Shanxi Province, comprehensively improved technology and created a complete set of bumper harvest experiences, including dense planting, fertilization, irrigation, and field management. In 1952, cotton-planting farmers in various regions actively learned from Qu Yaoli's advanced experience. The Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shanxi Province formulated a plan to promote Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton-planting experience and held a training class for more than 600 people, with Qu Yaoli personally imparting his knowledge. More than one million farmers in the entire region learned Qu Yaoli's advanced experience, universally increasing cotton yields. In Wanquan County, the 91,700 mu of dry-land cotton using Qu Yaoli's experience had an average yield per mu that exceeded 1951's by 75.5% and exceeded the 1952 production increase plan by 19%. Xia County has been rated as a "Cotton Bumper Harvest County" in the Shanxi Province autumn agricultural bumper harvest cross-inspection movement. Chen Yongkang's advanced experience of sparse dropping, small-plant square dense planting, phased fertilization, and rational water use, a rice bumper harvest model in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, was also greatly promoted in 1952. The Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party used the leadership method of "typical chain demonstration" to promote Chen Yongkang's advanced experience, further forming a surge of "visiting there and promoting it there, promoting it there and achieving bumper harvests there." Among the 813,000 mu of rice fields in the county, 65% of the rice fields adopted Chen Yongkang's bumper harvest experience; among them, more than 7,700 mu of rice fields adopted all of Chen Yongkang's experience, with an average yield increase of more than 40% compared to 1951, and more than 520,000 mu of rice fields that adopted part of Chen Yongkang's experience also increased by 20% to 30% compared to 1951.

    各地农业劳动模范带头制订计划
    发挥潜力争取普遍丰产
    【本报讯】受到中央人民政府农业部爱国丰产奖励的各地农业劳动模范和他们领导的互助合作组织，在一九五二年的丰产基础上，带头制订今年一年和今后三年、五年的生产计划，准备大力发挥农业生产潜力，争取普遍丰产。
    吉林省农业劳动模范韩恩领导的农业生产合作社，已经订出一九五二年到一九五六年的五年建设计划，同时发展农业、林业、畜牧业，要求五年内增产粮食一倍。山西省农业劳动模范李顺达，带领他的家乡平顺县西沟村全体农民，订出了一九五二年到一九五四年的三年建设计划；李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社并已具体地订出一九五三年第一季度的生产计划，他们正在学习苏联建设山区的经验，开始作农业基本建设的努力。年前山西省召开全省农业丰产劳动模范代表会议时，棉花丰产模范解县曲耀离、翼城县吴春安、绛县姚文章、盂县刘海悦四人制订生产计划，联名向全省植棉农民发起挑战。他们保证一九五三年水地棉花丰产面积要比一九五二年扩大三倍，平均每亩产棉一千斤到一千五百斤；旱地棉花丰产面积也要扩大一倍以上，平均每亩产棉五百五十斤到一千斤；并带动所在村棉花增产百分之三十到三十五，附近三十四个行政村棉花增产百分之二十到三十。
    一九五二年全国农业丰产的经验表明：我国农业生产方面有着极大的潜在力量；只要组织起来，大力推广先进经验和农业科学技术，就能发挥这种巨大潜力，获得普遍的丰产。
    在一九五二年内，全国各地著名农业劳动模范和他们领导的互助合作组织之中，除史安福、陈永康、耿长锁等少数由于特殊原因遭致庄稼减产，另有一部分未完成高额丰产地计划外，其他大部分得到了显著的丰产成绩。山西省李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社一百七十三亩秋地，平均每亩产粮食四百四十二斤，超过增产计划百分之四点五，超过当地一般产量百分之一百一十。辽东省于洪仁农业生产合作社十九点五亩单季水稻，平均产量每亩高达一千一百二十斤。在他们带动和影响下，一九五二年又出了更多的丰产模范。估计达到中央农业部丰产奖励标准的，将超过去年十倍以上。湖南省醴陵县邓光晋创造双季连作水稻每亩一千六百五十点七五斤的新纪录。河南省修武县薛臣有创造水地冬小麦每亩八百八十斤的新纪录。新疆省哈密县杨茂元创造水地春小麦每亩一千零四十斤的新纪录。山西省翼城县吴春安农业生产合作社创造水地棉花每亩一千零二十一点三斤的新纪录。
    一九五二年，各地农业劳动模范在中国共产党和人民政府的教育培养下，首先纷纷进一步组织起来。原来是单干的农业劳动模范，很多都带头组织了互助组；原来领导着互助组的农业劳动模范，也有不少在条件成熟的情况下，把互助组提高为农业生产合作社。如一九五一年获得“浙江省特等农业劳动模范”和“浙江省模范互助组”称号的许桂荣和他的互助组，在中共新登县城岭区委员会直接培养下，一九五二年进一步试办农业生产合作社，大大提高了产量。一九五一年全组水稻每亩平均产量五百二十斤，最高产量八百斤；一九五二年全社水稻每亩平均产量达到七百零半斤，最高产量每亩达一千零六十斤。在许桂荣农业生产合作社的影响下，城岭区互助合作运动有了蓬勃发展。
    在进一步组织起来的基础上，各地著名农业劳动模范发起和参加了规模巨大的爱国丰产运动，以自己的技术和先进经验，引导广大农民发挥农业生产潜力，把单位面积产量普遍提高了一步。山西省解县棉花丰产模范曲耀离，全面改进技术，创造了密植、施肥、灌溉和田间管理等一整套丰产经验。一九五二年各地植棉农民纷纷学习曲耀离的先进经验。山西省运城专署制订了推广曲耀离先进植棉经验的计划，并召开了六百多人的训练班，由曲耀离亲自传授。全专区有一百多万农民学习了曲耀离的先进经验，普遍提高了棉花的产量。万泉县运用曲耀离经验的九万一千七百多亩旱地棉花，每亩平均产量超过一九五一年百分之七十五点五，超过一九五二年增产计划百分之十九。夏县在山西省秋季农业丰产交义大检查运动中，已被评为“棉花丰产县”。江苏省松江县水稻丰产模范陈永康的落谷稀、小株方形密植、分期施肥和合理用水的先进经验，一九五二年也有很大推广。中共松江县委员会用“典型连环示范”的领导方法推广陈永康的先进经验，更形成“参观到那里就推广到那里，推广到那里就丰产到那里”的热潮。全县八十一万三千多亩稻田中，有百分之六十五的稻田采用了陈永康的丰产经验；其中七千七百多亩稻田采用了陈永康的全部经验，平均产量比一九五一年增产四成以上，采用陈永康部分经验的五十二万多亩稻田，也比一九五一年增产二成到三成。
