The Hongshan Coal Mine, under the Shandong Mining Bureau, experienced increased production enthusiasm among its workers after the "Three-Anti" movement and production and technological reform movements in 1952. As a result, it achieved certain successes in coal mining and tunneling and basically completed its production tasks. However, due to the lack of economic accounting awareness among the mine's leadership, management lagged far behind improvements in production technology, resulting in heavy debt. According to the mine's statistics from January to October 1952, the total cost overrun for the entire mine reached 17,942,843,719 yuan, making it impossible to complete various payments to higher authorities. The entire production revolving fund was maintained by misappropriating various remittance deductions and state bank loans. The mine misappropriated a total of 6,838,544,979 yuan of remittances and borrowed 12.3 billion yuan from the bank, which it was unable to repay when due.

A major reason for the cost overruns at the Hongshan Coal Mine was the unreasonable setting of wage quotas for underground personnel. Most of the mine's shafts had been using machine mining since 1952, but the unit price quotas implemented were still based on the standards from the manual mining era of 1950. This resulted in excessively high wages and significant cost overruns. For example, in November 1950, the average daily coal production of direct coal miners was 0.296 tons. However, after using new-style machine mining from July to September 1952, the average output per person reached 0.672 tons, an increase of 2.27 times, and wages also increased by 2.27 times. This created a situation of excessively high wages for underground workers, with wage overruns alone accounting for 50% of the total cost overrun. Due to the unreasonable unit price wage quotas and the use of the large-group mixed piecework method for wage calculation, the further development of workers' production enthusiasm and creativity was greatly hindered. Secondly, the waste of materials in the mine was very serious. The geology of the Hongshan mining area is complex, with many faults, so dense support methods were used to strengthen safety work. However, due to the unreasonable setting of wage quotas for timber recovery, the utilization rate of recovered timber was very low. For example, Hongliu Shaft stipulated that a well-recovered pit prop was worth 0.06 yuan in wages, while a damaged pit prop was worth 0.551 yuan if less than 20% damaged, and 0.4408 yuan if more than 20% damaged. The difference in wages between good and bad recovery was small, so recovery workers simply damaged large quantities of timber to save trouble and increase the number of props recovered. In addition, there was a great deal of waste in the mine's enterprise management expenses. There were too many non-production administrative personnel; currently, 180 people in the mine could be transferred to production departments. There was also waste of water and electricity; many street lights and office lights in the mine shafts were left on during the day.

The mine had no plans for material supply before July of last year. Although there were planned quotas after July, they were just a formality. Currently, the total value of auxiliary materials, miscellaneous parts, and low-value consumables in the mine is 15.2 billion yuan. However, the quota reserve is only 2.9 billion yuan, with general overstocking accounting for 1.3 billion yuan. The remaining 11 billion yuan are stagnant materials that urgently need to be processed, but from August to November, they only processed 745 million yuan.

The mine's leaders and management personnel do not pay attention to the storage and use of machinery. Important machines such as water pumps, electric winches, ventilators, crushers, and coal cutters are left in the open air or arbitrarily placed on the ground in warehouses, exposed to humidity. Some warehouses leak, but they are not repaired in a timely manner, causing many machines to weather and rust. The 20 trainloads of pit props that the mine stored on behalf of the Shandong Mining Bureau were not properly stored and are now mostly rotten and unusable.

In addition, the financial management of the Hongshan Coal Mine's capital construction in 1952 was also extremely chaotic. The capital construction funds accumulated accounted for 66% of the capital construction appropriation, but on the other hand, it frequently borrowed money from the bank (currently still owing 1.9 billion yuan) and misappropriated more than 1.03 billion yuan of production funds. Due to poor planning in capital construction, there were many changes in project plans. There were also cases of starting work without a plan. Due to untimely supply of equipment and materials, labor allocation prioritized production over capital construction, affecting the progress of the project. All of this has caused great losses to state property.

The chaotic financial management situation at the Hongshan Coal Mine is mainly because the mine's leaders lack economic accounting awareness. They only focus on production, neglecting management, and even more so neglecting capital construction. They also pit the interests of the state against the interests of the workers. They clearly know that the unit price wage quotas are unreasonable, and some employees have long felt that they are unreasonable and demand reform, but the mine's leaders one-sidedly believe that revising the unit price is "lowering wages," which will affect workers' production enthusiasm, so they have delayed it for a long time and have not adjusted it. The Shandong Mining Bureau is also well aware of this situation, but has not taken active measures to correct it. Secondly, the general cost management personnel are limited to statistical figures and have not analyzed and studied cost accounting. The mine's leaders also do not carefully study the reports, discover problems, and improve enterprise management, resulting in large cost overruns. The Shandong Mining Bureau should thoroughly investigate this situation and quickly and actively resolve it.

### 山东矿务局洪山煤矿领导干部缺乏经济核算思想  经营管理落后使成本超支负债累累

    山东矿务局洪山煤矿领导干部缺乏经济核算思想
    经营管理落后使成本超支负债累累
    山东矿务局所属洪山煤矿，经过一九五二年“三反”运动及生产改革、技术改革运动，广大职工的生产积极性不断提高，因而在采煤与掘进方面获得一定的成绩，并基本上完成了生产任务。但是由于该矿领导干部缺乏经济核算思想，经营管理远远落后于生产技术的改进，结果反而负债累累。根据该矿一九五二年一至十月份统计，全矿成本超支总计达一百七十九亿四千二百八十四万三千七百一十九元，致使各种上缴任务不能完成，全部生产周转资金靠挪用各项上缴提款及国家银行贷款维持。该矿共计挪用上缴款六十八亿三千八百五十四万四千九百七十九元，并向银行贷款一百二十三亿元，到期亦无法归还。
    造成洪山煤矿成本超支的重要原因是该矿井下人员工资定额不够合理。该矿大部分矿井从一九五二年已使用机器采煤，但所实行的工资定额单价却仍沿用一九五○年手工业采煤时的单价定额标准，这就形成工资过高，超支过大的现象。比如一九五○年十一月，直接采煤工人平均每天采煤量为零点二九六吨，但一九五二年七至九月使用新式机器采煤后，每人平均产量达到零点六七二吨，采煤量增加为二点二七倍，工资也提高为二点二七倍。这就形成井下工人工资过高现象，仅工资一项超支即占成本超支的百分之五十。由于工资定额单价不合理，加以工资计算仍采用大组混合计件办法，大大阻碍了工人生产积极性、创造性的进一步发挥。其次，该矿材料的浪费很严重。洪山矿区地质复杂，断层多，为加强保安工作，采用密集支柱办法。但由于回柱工资定额不合理，致回柱利用率很低，如洪六井规定：回好的坑木一根订为工资○·○六分，回坏的坑木二十分以下者每根订为工资○·五五一分，二十分以上者每根订为○·四四○八分，回柱好坏相差数不大，回柱工人单纯为了省事和使回柱数多，损坏了大批回柱。此外，该矿企业管理费用有很大浪费，非生产的行政管理人员过多，目前该矿有一百八十人是可以转入生产部门的。该矿还有水电浪费，很多矿井上的路灯、办公室电灯，白天照常亮着。
    该矿在材料供应方面，去年七月以前没有计划，七月份以后虽有计划定额，但都流于形式。目前该矿的辅助材料、零星配件及低值易耗品等的总值是一百五十二亿元。但定额储备只二十九亿元，一般性超储者占十三亿元，其余一百一十亿元是属急待处理的呆滞器材，但自八月份至十一月份，他们只处理了七亿四千五百多万元。
    该矿领导干部和管理人员不重视机器的保管和使用。如重要的机器——水泵、电绞车、抽风机、粉碎机、割煤机等都放在露天下，或随意放在仓库地下，遭受潮湿。有些仓库漏雨，也没有及时修理，使不少的机器都风化生锈了。该矿代山东矿务局保存的二十火车坑木，也没有妥加保管，现在大部腐烂，不堪使用。
    另外，洪山煤矿在一九五二年的基本建设中，财务管理也异常混乱。该矿基本建设资金积压占基本建设拨款百分之六十六，但另一方面又时常向银行贷款（现尚贷十九亿元），还挪用生产资金十亿三千余万元。该矿在基本建设中由于计划不周，工程计划变更很多。没有计划自行动工的事也有。由于器材供应不及时，劳动调配是先生产后基本建设，影响了工程的进行。这都使得国家财产受到很大损失。
    洪山煤矿财务管理工作产生这种混乱情况，主要是因为该矿领导干部缺乏对企业的经济核算思想。他们只重视生产，忽视经营，更忽视基本建设，并且把国家利益与工人利益对立起来。他们明明知道工资单价定额不合理，而且有些职工也早觉得不合理，要求改革，但该矿领导干部却片面认为修改单价就是“降低工资”，会影响工人生产积极性，致长期拖延，不加调整。山东矿务局也深知这一情况，但也没有采取积极的措施，进行纠正。其次一般的成本管理人员也只限于统计数字，没有把成本核算加以分析研究。该矿领导干部也不认真研究表报，发现问题，改进企业经营管理，因而造成成本大大超支现象。山东矿务局对这种情况应彻底进行检查，迅速积极加以解决才是。
