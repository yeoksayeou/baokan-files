    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) recently issued a notice to trade union organizations at all levels regarding the implementation of the revised Labor Insurance Regulations. The notice, after pointing out the significant importance of promulgating the Labor Insurance Regulations, instructed trade union organizations at all levels to carry out the following tasks effectively: First, conduct in-depth publicity and explanation work among the broad masses of workers and staff, so that the broad masses of workers and staff further recognize that only on the basis of striving to increase production can material and cultural life be continuously improved. Encourage workers to further unleash their labor enthusiasm and improve labor productivity to ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the national economic construction plan. Second, trade union organizations in basic construction units and state-owned construction companies that fall under the expanded scope of implementation this time should promptly, together with industrial and engineering departments, go through registration procedures with the local labor administrative organs, jointly do a good job in preparation, establish and improve the trade union grassroots labor insurance committee, and ask the local health administrative departments to assist in establishing or strengthening on-site health and medical institutions; and seize the current winter training period for construction workers to vigorously carry out publicity and education work, select activists from among the workers and equip them with appropriate key personnel, hold labor insurance training classes, and then carry out card registration. During registration, it is necessary to organize forces, first obtain typical experience, and then promote it comprehensively and steadily. Third, trade union organizations at all levels should take the initiative to assist enterprise administrations or employers in establishing, improving, and enriching health and medical work in factories and mines, and, according to the urgent needs of workers and possible economic conditions, assist and supervise enterprise administrations or employers in establishing labor insurance undertakings such as spare-time sanatoriums and nutritious canteens, in order to effectively prevent the occurrence and development of diseases, solve the health problems of workers, and reduce absenteeism due to illness. Fourth, trade union organizations at all levels should establish and improve labor insurance organizational structures and working systems, appropriately supplement cadres, and enrich institutions. Trade union grassroots organizations should establish and improve labor insurance committees to manage the income and expenditure of the labor insurance fund and supervise the labor insurance expenses directly paid by enterprises. The financial departments of trade unions at all levels should be responsible for doing a good job in the income and expenditure statements of labor insurance funds and submit them on time. Regularly check and improve the payment, management, and use of labor insurance funds. Labor insurance departments of trade unions at all levels should also take the initiative to assist financial departments in jointly doing this work well. Fifth, trade union organizations in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, as well as industrial trade unions, especially the national committees of railway, postal and telecommunications, and ordnance trade unions, should seize the time to hold short-term labor insurance cadre training classes, either separate from production or part-time, according to specific circumstances, and convene professional meetings when necessary, in order to understand the situation and promote advanced experience. The cadres who have been trained should be fixed and specialized in their work as much as possible to meet the needs of continuous development of work in the future. Sixth, for enterprise units that have implemented labor insurance in the past, workers and staff who have not yet completed labor insurance card registration should complete registration and review. If it is difficult to register all at once, it can be carried out in batches. Enterprises and trade union organizations that are not within the scope of labor insurance implementation should, as in the past, formulate labor insurance contracts or take other measures according to specific circumstances to alleviate or solve the difficulties in the lives of workers and staff. Seventh, trade unions at all levels, both industrial and local, should vigorously assist basic construction units in carrying out the above work and submit a report on the implementation of the revised Labor Insurance Regulations to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions by the end of March.
