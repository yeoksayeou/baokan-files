Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 15th: Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba, head of the Tibetan tribute delegation, and deputy heads Danba Rijie, Dingjia·Duojijicun, along with all representatives, presented gifts to the Northwest Military and Political Committee on January 13th on behalf of the Panchen Erdeni. Ma Mingfang, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, accepted the gifts.

Present at the gift-giving ceremony were: Yang Mingxuan, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee; Wang Feng, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Committee; Yang Zilian, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee; Chang Lifu, Secretary-General of the Northwest Military and Political Committee; Cheng Bairen, Minister of the Culture Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee; Han Zhao'e, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government; Ma Fuchen (Hui nationality), Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government; and more than 30 heads of Northwest regional organs and organizations. Peng Sike, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, who accompanied the Tibetan tribute delegation, was also present.

Before presenting the gifts, Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba delivered a speech saying: The current Panchen Erdeni was born in Qinghai Province. In the past, the Tibetan local government and the monks and lay officials of Zhaxilhunbu Monastery in Xigaze tried their best to welcome Panchen Erdeni back to Tibet, but this wish was never realized due to various obstructions by the Kuomintang reactionary government and imperialists. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the influence of Chairman Mao's and the Communist Party's national policies, Panchen Erdeni has safely returned to Tibet. Now, the Tibetan people, under the cordial cooperation and joint efforts of the two leaders, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, have united strongly and firmly. When Panchen Erdeni returned to Tibet from the Northwest, he received great help from the leaders of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, for which the Tibetan people are very grateful. Today, our Tibetan tribute delegation respectfully presents some gifts on behalf of the Panchen Erdeni, hoping you will accept our small token of appreciation. In the future, we also hope that the leaders of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the compatriots of all ethnic groups in the Northwest will continue to provide more assistance to our Tibetan people so as to rapidly build a new Tibet for the motherland.

Then, amidst the music, the head and deputy heads of the Tibetan tribute delegation and the representatives presented gifts to Vice Chairman Ma Mingfang. The gifts included the most precious longevity Buddha in Buddhism, a portrait of Chairman Mao painted by a famous Tibetan painter, Tibetan specialties such as deer antlers, carpets, and other items, totaling forty-four pieces, as well as a handwritten letter from Panchen Erdeni.

After accepting the gifts, Vice Chairman Ma Mingfang delivered a reply speech. He first expressed his gratitude to the Tibetan tribute delegation for presenting valuable gifts on behalf of the Panchen Erdeni. He then said: The Northwest of the motherland and Tibet of the motherland not only have a long and close connection in history, but also the Northwest of the motherland is the hometown of the current Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. Therefore, today we are gathered here with the representatives of the Tibetan tribute delegation and accept the precious gifts presented by the Tibetan tribute delegation on behalf of the Panchen Erdeni, which feels particularly cordial and exciting. This fully demonstrates the profound brotherly friendship between our nationalities. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest have done some work to support the peaceful liberation of Tibet. In the future, we will continue to maintain close contact with the Tibetan local government under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, help each other, and work together for the construction of the motherland!

That evening, the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee hosted a banquet to entertain all the representatives of the Tibetan tribute delegation. Correction: In the report "The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Instructs League Committees at All Levels to Hold League Congresses Well" published on page one of this newspaper on January 5, the phrase "before the Second National League Congress in 1952..." should read "before the Second National League Congress in 1953".

    西藏致敬团代表班禅向西北军政委员会赠礼
    【新华社西安十五日电】西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴，副团长丹巴日杰、定甲·多吉吉村和全体代表，在一月十三日代表班禅额尔德尼向西北军政委员会敬赠礼品。西北军政委员会副主席马明方受礼。
    敬赠礼品时，在场的有：西北军政委员会文化教育委员会主任杨明轩、民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋、政治法律委员会副主任杨子廉、西北军政委员会秘书长常黎夫、西北军政委员会文化部部长成柏仁、陕西省人民政府副主席韩兆鹗、青海省人民政府副主席马辅臣（回族）和西北区各机关团体负责人三十余人。在场的还有陪同西藏致敬团前来的中央人民政府民族事务委员会办公厅副主任朋斯克。
    敬赠礼品前，柳霞·土登塔巴致词说：现世班禅额尔德尼是在青海省诞生的，过去西藏地方政府和日喀则的札什伦布寺的僧俗官员，曾尽力设法迎接班禅额尔德尼回西藏去，但是，由于国民党反动政府和帝国主义者的多方阻挠，这个愿望一直没有实现。自从西藏和平解放后，在毛主席和共产党的民族政策感召下，班禅额尔德尼平安地回到了西藏。现在西藏人民在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼两位领袖的亲切合作与共同努力下，已经坚强巩固地团结起来了。班禅额尔德尼从西北返回西藏时，承蒙西北军政委员会各位首长和西北各族人民的大力帮助，西藏人民十分感谢。今天我们西藏致敬团谨代表班禅额尔德尼敬赠一些礼品，希望接受我们这一点心意。今后并希望西北军政委员会各位首长和西北各族各界同胞继续对我们西藏人民多加帮助，以便迅速建设祖国的新西藏。
    接着，在礼乐声中，西藏致敬团正、副团长和代表们向马明方副主席敬赠礼品。礼品中有佛教的最珍贵的长寿佛、西藏名画家绘制的毛主席像、西藏土产鹿茸、地毯等四十四件，还有班禅额尔德尼的亲笔信。
    马明方副主席在接受礼品后致答词，他首先对西藏致敬团代表班禅额尔德尼赠送珍贵礼品表示感谢。接着他说：祖国的西北和祖国的西藏不仅在历史上有着悠久密切的联系，同时，祖国的西北又是现世达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的故乡。因此，今天我们和西藏致敬团的代表们欢聚一堂，并接受西藏致敬团代表班禅额尔德尼赠送的珍贵礼品，感觉异常亲切和兴奋，这充分表现了我们民族间兄弟般的深厚友谊。西北各民族人民在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，对支援西藏和平解放曾做了一些工作，今后我们仍将在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，和西藏地方政府取得密切联系，互相帮助，共同为祖国的建设事业而奋斗！
    当日晚，西北军政委员会民族事务委员会并设宴招待西藏致敬团全体代表。更正一月五日本报第一版所载“青年团中央指示各级团委开好团代表大会”稿中所称“在一九五二年全国第二次团代表大会之前，……”其中“一九五二年”应为“一九五三年”。
