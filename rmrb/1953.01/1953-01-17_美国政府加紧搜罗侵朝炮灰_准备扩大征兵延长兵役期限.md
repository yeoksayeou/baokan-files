Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The heavy casualties suffered by the American aggressors in the war of aggression against Korea have already forced the U.S. government to consider expanding the scope of conscription and extending the terms of service in order to gather the cannon fodder needed to continue and expand the Korean War. According to the Associated Press, Lewis Hershey, director of the U.S. Selective Service System, demanded in the Selective Service System's bulletin that the number of draft deferments be tightened. He said that the manpower supply situation of the U.S. armed forces is currently taking a "sharp turn for the worse," and if the number of deferments is not greatly tightened, it will be virtually impossible to meet the needs of conscription. Hershey admitted that the U.S.'s manpower resources are "shrinking." He revealed that in order to change this situation, the U.S. government is preparing to conscript college students and others who were originally eligible for deferment. The Associated Press also reported that James Van Zandt, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, demanded that the U.S. military service term be extended from the current twenty-four months to thirty or thirty-six months. He said that the term of military service must be frozen before U.S. troops can launch another offensive in Korea. Otherwise, there will not be enough combat personnel. Van Zandt's demands will undoubtedly be strongly opposed by the American people who are unwilling to sell their lives for Wall Street. Therefore, the Associated Press had to admit that this is a "political problem." And although "several members of Congress" also "privately agreed to extend the term of military service," they "were unwilling to make general comments on the issue."

    美国政府加紧搜罗侵朝炮灰
    准备扩大征兵延长兵役期限
    【新华社十六日讯】美国侵略者在侵朝战争中所遭受的惨重伤亡，已经迫使美国政府不得不考虑用扩大征兵范围和延长兵役期限的办法，来搜罗为继续和扩大朝鲜战争所需要的炮灰。据美联社报道，美国征兵局局长刘易士·赫尔希在征兵局的公报上要求紧缩缓役人数。他说，目前美国武装部队的人力供应的情况正在“急转直下”，如果不大大紧缩缓役人数，那么实际上就将无法应付征兵的需要。赫尔希承认，美国的人力资源“正在缩小”。他透露：为了改变这种情况，美国政府准备征召原来可以缓役的大学学生和其他的人。美联社还报道说，众议院军事委员会委员詹姆斯·范展特要求将美国的兵役期限从现在的二十四个月延长到三十个月或三十六个月，他说，必须冻结兵役期限，然后美国部队才可以在朝鲜发动另一个攻势。不然的话，战斗兵员不够。范展特的要求无疑将遭到不愿替华尔街卖命的美国人民的强烈反对，因此，美联社也不得不承认这是一个“政治上的难题”。而“几位国会人士”虽然也“私下赞成延长兵役期限”，却“不愿对这问题发表一般评论”。
