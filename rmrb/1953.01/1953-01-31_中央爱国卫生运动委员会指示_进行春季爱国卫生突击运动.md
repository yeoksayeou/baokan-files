Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee Directive:
Launch Spring Patriotic Health Shock Campaign

    The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee's directive on launching a spring patriotic health shock campaign.

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in its directive on continuing to carry out the patriotic health campaign in 1953, proposed that: In the spring of 1953, the whole country should carry out a short-term patriotic health shock campaign. To this end, the following instructions are issued to local and military patriotic health campaign committees at all levels:

    1.  The task of the spring health shock campaign is: to mobilize the masses to eliminate breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects as early as possible, to eliminate young disease-carrying animals as early as possible, and to conduct in-depth inspections, arrangements, and deployments of various organizations and measures for the regular patriotic health campaign throughout the year. The success of the patriotic health campaign throughout the year depends first and foremost on whether the spring patriotic health shock campaign is carried out thoroughly, that is, it should lay a good foundation for the year's patriotic health work.

    2.  The time limit for the spring patriotic health shock campaign is generally set at two to three weeks, and the start date can be determined by each region according to the specific situation, but it must be completed before spring plowing.

    3.  During the spring patriotic health shock campaign, efforts should be concentrated on solving the following issues: First, thoroughly remove the dirt and filth accumulated in winter; Second, dredge clogged ditches and fill in sewage pits; Third, tidy up and add to toilets and livestock pens, dispose of feces, mobilize the digging of fly pupae, and move urban manure yards to more open areas in the suburbs; Fourth, repair wells and establish water collection piers and water filtration ponds to ensure clean drinking water; Fifth, conduct a thorough clean-up of indoor and outdoor and personal hygiene; Sixth, carry out in-depth patriotic health propaganda and education, focusing on anti-germ warfare, prevention of endemic and infectious diseases, hygiene in the catering industry, hygiene in the hygiene industry (barber shops, bathrooms, etc.), industrial and mining hygiene, and maternal and child hygiene, and focus on training personnel in the food industry.

    4.  When carrying out the spring patriotic health shock campaign, attention should be paid to the following issues: First, this year, great efforts should be made to help and promote areas and units that did not move or achieved little last year, so that they can catch up with the ranks of the campaign; Second, pay attention to combining with spring plowing preparation work and industrial construction work; Third, organize patriotic health model workers to promote everyone through them; Fourth, grasp the principle of "spend less money and do more things" to avoid extravagance and waste; Fifth, mobilize the masses with patient persuasion and the attitude of cadres leading by example, and avoid coercive orders; Sixth, organize work inspections, visits, and evaluations to better promote this movement.

    5.  In order to carry out the spring patriotic health shock campaign in a step-by-step and orderly manner and avoid wasting time and manpower, prior preparation is very important. This preparation work should begin now, requiring: First, comprehensively reorganize various related patriotic health and epidemic prevention organizations; Second, rectify all anti-germ warfare institutions and measures, and overcome the phenomenon of laxity in anti-germ warfare work in some places; Third, conduct a detailed investigation of breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects, identify work priorities, and conduct measurements to properly allocate manpower; Fourth, discuss with relevant departments and formulate specific and feasible spring patriotic health shock campaign plans; Fifth, prepare all the tools needed for filling, repairing, and cleaning; Sixth, during the Spring Festival, adopt various artistic forms (such as New Year pictures, lanterns, Yangko operas, peep shows, slides, small mobile exhibitions, etc.) to carry out propaganda and mobilization work on continuing to carry out the patriotic health campaign.

    The Patriotic Health Campaign Committees of major administrative regions and military regions should promptly report the preparation work and spring Patriotic Health Shock Campaign plans to the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee based on the above.

    中央爱国卫生运动委员会指示
    进行春季爱国卫生突击运动
    【新华社三十日讯】中央爱国卫生运动委员会关于进行春季爱国卫生突击运动的指示。
    中央人民政府政务院在关于一九五三年继续开展爱国卫生运动的指示中曾提出：在一九五三年春季，全国应当进行一次短期的爱国卫生突击运动。为此，特向地方与部队各级爱国卫生运动委员会发布如下指示：
    一、春季卫生突击运动的任务是：发动群众，对于病媒昆虫孳生繁殖场所进行及早清除，对于幼小病媒动物进行及早扑灭，对于今年全年经常性爱国卫生运动的各项组织与措施进行深入检查、整理和布置。今年全年爱国卫生运动的成绩如何，首先决定于今春的爱国卫生突击运动是否进行得彻底，就是说它应当给全年爱国卫生工作奠定一个良好基础。
    二、春季爱国卫生突击运动的时限一般规定为二至三个星期，开始日期可依具体情况各地自定，但一定要在春耕前完成。
    三、在春季爱国卫生突击运动期间，主要应集中力量解决以下几项事项：第一、将冬季积存的污秽彻底清除；第二、将淤塞的沟渠疏通，将污水坑填平；第三、整理和增修厕所畜厩，处理粪便，发动挖蝇蛹，将城市内的粪场移至郊外较空旷地区；第四、修浚水井，建立汲水码头及滤水池，作到饮水清洁；第五、将住室内外及个人卫生进行一次彻底整顿；第六、以反细菌战、预防地方病传染病，饮食行业卫生，卫生行业（理发店、浴室等）卫生，工矿卫生和妇婴卫生为主要内容，进行深入的爱国卫生宣传教育，并可重点进行食品行业人员的训练。
    四、在进行春季爱国卫生突击运动时，应注意以下几个问题：第一、对于去年没有动起来或成绩不大的地区和单位，今年应大力给以帮助和推动，使他们赶上运动的行列；第二、注意与春耕准备工作及工业建设工作相结合；第三、组织爱国卫生模范工作者，通过他们推动大家；第四、掌握“少用钱，多办事”的原则，避免铺张浪费；第五、应以耐心说服，干部以身作则的态度发动群众，切忌强迫命令作风；第六、组织工作检查、参观、评比，以更好地推动这一运动。
    五、为了在春季爱国卫生突击运动中做到有步骤有条理地进行工作，避免时间与人力的浪费，事先的准备工作是非常重要的。这一准备工作目前即应开始，要求做到：第一、将各种有关的爱国卫生防疫组织加以普遍整理；第二、将反细菌战的一切机构与措施加以整顿，克服有些地方对于反细菌战工作表现松懈的现象；第三、进行对于病媒昆虫孳生繁殖场所的详细调查，找出工作重点，并进行测量，以便适当配备人力；第四、与各有关部门商讨，制订具体可行的春季爱国卫生突击运动计划；第五、把填修扫除工作所需的一切工具都准备好；第六、在春节期间，采取各种艺术形式（如年画，花灯，秧歌剧，洋片，幻灯，小型流动展览会等）进行关于继续开展爱国卫生运动的宣传鼓动工作。
    各大行政区及军区爱国卫生运动委员会应根据上述各项，将准备工作的情况和春季爱国卫生突击运动的计划迅速报告中央爱国卫生运动委员会。
                中央爱国卫生运动委员会
                一九五三年一月三十日
