Xinhua News Agency, January 25th. Since our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement protesting the U.S. government's dispatch of an RB-29 special-task aircraft to intrude into our northeastern airspace for strategic reconnaissance, the U.S. government and military authorities in Washington and Tokyo have been thrown into chaos, frantically engaging in shameless denials. However, these clumsily fabricated excuses have only further exposed the U.S. Air Force's provocative crimes.

After our Foreign Minister Zhou's statement was published on the 21st, the U.S. Air Force authorities in Washington initially pretended to "not know" about the RB-29 aircraft intruding into Chinese northeastern airspace. An Air Force spokesman said on the 21st that they had "no knowledge" of the matter. However, the ironclad evidence of the wreckage of the U.S. RB-29 aircraft shot down by the Chinese Air Force and the captured U.S. Air Force personnel are undeniable. The U.S. government authorities' attempt to evade responsibility by pretending not to know is clearly an ostrich policy and utterly useless. Therefore, the U.S. Far East Air Force Command in Tokyo and the U.S. State Department's press officer in Washington had to issue statements successively, admitting that they "knew" about the aircraft and that the U.S. Air Force indeed had this aircraft and these personnel. But they still shamelessly denied that the aircraft had intruded into our northeastern airspace for strategic reconnaissance. The statement only admitted that the aircraft was "distributing leaflets over Korea," while completely avoiding any mention of strategic reconnaissance. What is particularly strange is that they incoherently and arbitrarily linked the aircraft's mission with germ warfare. Why is the U.S. government so nervous, as if Mrs. Macbeth saw murderous bloodstains on her own snow-white hands? In fact, these hastily concocted denials themselves revealed loopholes and exposed their lies. While falsely claiming that the aircraft was flying "far from the Manchurian-Korean border," the statement also, with a guilty conscience, said that the aircraft might have "crashed in Manchuria." The U.S. Far East Air Force Command originally admitted that it was an RB-29 aircraft, and it is known that, according to the captured U.S. Air Force personnel, this type of aircraft is a B-29 bomber modified for strategic reconnaissance, air-dropping special agents, and communication liaison. The U.S. Far East Air Force Command later realized that admitting it was an RB-29 aircraft would be tantamount to admitting that they were engaged in criminal strategic reconnaissance and espionage activities. Therefore, after the statement was issued, they hastily "corrected" the aircraft to a B-29 aircraft.

Despite the U.S. Air Force authorities' futile attempts to cover up their criminal behavior, a dispatch from Tokyo by Associated Press reporter You Song on the 25th openly revealed the U.S. Air Force's conspiratorial activities to expand the war of aggression against Korea. He revealed that the U.S. Air Force is actively intruding into our airspace for strategic reconnaissance, saying: "The Far East Air Force's high-altitude photographers have not let their cameras remain idle," and some aircraft and personnel "have scouted out some information about the Chinese Communists." Although You Song tried his best to say that this was done by "other" aircraft and not by the RB-29 aircraft shot down by our Air Force, undeniable evidence proves that this RB-29 aircraft was one of the many U.S. aircraft engaged in this criminal activity.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 26th. On January 23rd, our Air Force shot down another U.S. aircraft that invaded our airspace over Kuandian County, Liaodong Province. This is the second U.S. military aircraft shot down for invading our airspace in half a month.

At 11:45 on the 23rd, four U.S. F-86 aircraft invaded our airspace over Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, from Lao Yizhou, Korea. One of them was quickly shot down by our intercepting Air Force, and the enemy pilot was captured alive. The other three fled in panic.

The U.S. F-86 aircraft was shot down at exactly 12:00. Its tail number was 731, and the fuselage was shattered in Baichengzi Village, Third District, Kuandian County. After the aircraft was hit, the pilot parachuted to the ground and was captured alive by us. The prisoner is the commander of the 16th Squadron of the 51st Wing of the 5th Air Force of the U.S. Air Force in Korea, named Heller, Edwin Lewis, with military number 9900-A, aged 34.

    美政府无耻抵赖美机侵入我东北领空侦察
    我空军又击落侵入东北宽甸县的美机一架
    【新华社二十五日讯】自从我国周恩来外长发表关于抗议美国政府派遣一架RB—29型特务飞机侵入我国东北领空进行战略侦察的声明以后，华盛顿和东京的美国政府和军事当局乱作一团，慌张地进行无耻抵赖。然而，这些编造得十分拙劣的狡赖，已使美国空军的挑衅罪行欲盖弥彰。
    在我国周外长声明于二十一日发表以后，华盛顿美国空军当局起先装作“不知道”有这架RB—29型飞机侵入中国东北领空的事情。空军当局发言人在二十一日说，对这事“并无知悉”。但是，被中国空军击落的美国这架RB—29型飞机的残骸以及被中国捕获的美国空军人员这些铁的罪证俱在，美国政府当局企图以装作不知道来躲避罪责的手法，显然是鸵鸟办法，毫无用处的。因此，东京美国远东空军司令部及华盛顿美国国务院新闻发布官不得不相继发表声明，承认“知道”这架飞机，承认美国空军确有这架飞机及这些人员。但他们仍然无耻抵赖这架飞机曾侵入我国东北领空进行战略侦察。声明里只肯承认这架飞机是在“朝鲜上空散发传单”的，而关于战略侦察方面却根本一字不敢触及。尤其奇怪的是，他们竟颠三倒四，自行把这架飞机的任务和进行细菌战扯在一起。美国政府为什么这样心虚，简直和马克伯什夫人在她自己雪白的手心里看见了杀人的血迹一样？事实上，这些匆匆编造出来的抵赖声明本身就露出了漏洞和马脚。声明中一方面说谎道，这架飞机是在“离满洲朝鲜边境很远”的地方飞行的，一方面又作贼心虚地说，这架飞机可能“坠毁在满洲境内”。美国远东空军司令部原来承认这是一架RB—29型的飞机，而人们知道，据被俘的美国空军人员供称，这种飞机是B—29型轰炸机改装来供战略侦察、空投特务和通讯联络用的。美国远东空军司令部后来看到如果承认是RB—29型飞机，就等于承认了他们是在进行罪恶的战略侦察与间谍活动，因此，在声明发表后，又手忙脚乱地把这架飞机“更正”为一架B—29型飞机。
    尽管美国空军当局这样徒然地来掩饰其罪恶行为，美联社记者尤松二十五日自东京发出的电讯中却已公开透露了美国空军为着扩大侵略朝鲜战争而进行的阴谋活动。他透露美国空军正在积极侵入我国领空进行战略侦察，他说：“远东空军高空飞行的摄影人员没有让他们的摄影机闲起来”，曾有一些飞机和飞行人员“已经侦察到共军的一些情况”。虽然尤松竭力企图把这种事情说成是“别的”一些飞机干的而不是被我国空军击落的这架RB—29型飞机干的，然而不容抵赖的证据证明，这架RB—29型飞机正是干这种罪恶勾当的许多美国飞机中的一架。
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】一月二十三日，我空军在辽东省宽甸县上空又击落侵犯我领空的美国飞机一架，这是半个月内击落的第二架侵犯我国领空的美国军用飞机。
    二十三日十一时四十五分，美国F—86型飞机四架从朝鲜老义州侵入我国辽东省宽甸县上空，其中一架为我迎击空军迅速打落，并生俘敌驾驶员，另三架狼狈窜逃。
    这架F—86型的美国飞机是在十二时正被击落的，它的机号是七三一，机身已碎毁在宽甸县第三区白城子村。当该机被打中后，驾驶员一名跳伞着陆，被我生俘。这个俘虏是美国侵朝空军第五航空队五十一大队十六中队中校中队长，名叫海勒尔·艾得文·路易斯（HELLER，EDWINLEWIS），军号是九九零零——A，年三十四岁。
