　　France experienced a half-month of “anarchic” crisis, and finally Radical Socialist René Mayer cobbled together a cabinet to pick up the mess left by Pinay. The difficult birth of the new cabinet reflects that, with the deepening of France's economic crisis and the growing strength of the French people, the contradictions between the various right-wing parties in France are becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile. These "American parties" despised by the people find it extremely difficult to gather a relatively stable majority in parliament. However, the formation of the new cabinet does not mean that the French political crisis has been resolved.

　　The political crisis in France was caused by the economic crisis, and the economic crisis was caused by following the United States' war policy. Many French cabinets in the past were short-lived because they could not overcome the increasingly serious economic crisis. Therefore, any right-wing cabinet, if it continues to pursue a war policy that betrays national interests, will inevitably be unable to avoid the fate of a disgraceful downfall.

　　How did Mayer form his new cabinet? He mainly relied on collusion with the De Gaulle faction. Since Pinay's resignation, De Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" has been eager to try and form a cabinet. The party's Soustelle put forward a "minimum program," openly demanding the revision of the constitution, weakening the power of the parliament, and attempting to pave the way for the establishment of fascist rule. However, because the various right-wing parties were afraid of the strength of the French people and did not dare to support it rashly, it finally failed. The "De Gaulle liaison officer," Pierre-Henri Teitgen of the Popular Republican Movement, also failed to form a cabinet. Finally, Mayer came out under the banner of the "middle." On the one hand, he won the support of the De Gaulle faction by promising to actively promote the revision of the constitution; on the other hand, he maintained an ambiguous "cooperation" with the Popular Republican Movement by guaranteeing efforts to secure the passage of the "European Army Treaty" in parliament. At the same time, he expressed his intention to continue the economic policies that Pinay had failed to implement, gaining the trust of the so-called "moderate independents." This is how Mayer used his skillful means to put together the necessary majority in parliament. But the French people will absolutely not support such a government. When Mayer implements the reactionary political, diplomatic, and economic measures enshrined in his policy program, and further attacks the French people's democracy, freedom, and rights to life, he will inevitably encounter the fierce opposition and blows of the people. Under the strong pressure of the people, the majority group in parliament that supports the government will inevitably disintegrate.

　　The Mayer cabinet has taken office, and a pile of difficult financial and economic problems are placed before it. What will he use to maintain huge military expenditures and reduce the budget deficit? What will he use to save the franc from bankruptcy? What will he use to quell the French people's dissatisfaction with the ruling group's disastrous policies? Pinay's "experiment" has failed, can Mayer's "experiment" succeed? The recent statement issued by the French Communist Party has reflected the unanimous desire of the French people, who demand the establishment of a government that implements a policy of peace and national independence. Mayer's government is not such a government, it absolutely cannot save France from the abyss of disaster, therefore it will absolutely not be a stable government.

### 法国迈耶内阁能有什么作为

    法国迈耶内阁能有什么作为
    法国经历了半个月的“无政府”的危机，最后由激进社会党的迈耶拼凑成了一个内阁，来接起比内扔下的烂摊子。新阁的难产，反映了随着法国经济危机的不断加深以及法国人民力量的日益增长，法国各右翼党派的矛盾愈来愈难以调和；这些为人民所唾弃的“美国党”要想在议会中纠集一个比较稳定的多数也极不容易。新阁的组成却并不意味着法国政治危机已经解除。
    法国的政治危机是由经济危机引起的，而经济危机则是因为追随美国的战争政策造成的。法国过去许多内阁短命，就是因为它不能克服日趋严重的经济危机。因此，任何一个右翼的内阁，如果继续执行出卖民族利益的战争政策，必然无法避免狼狈倒台的命运。
    迈耶是怎样组成它的新阁的呢？他主要是靠和戴高乐派的勾结。自比内下台以后，戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”便蠢蠢欲动，企图组阁。该党的苏斯戴尔提出了一个“最低纲领”，露骨地要求修改宪法，削弱议会的权力，企图为建立法西斯统治铺平道路。但是因为各右翼党派慑于法国人民的力量不敢贸然予以支持，终于失败。“戴高乐的联络官”人民共和党的皮杜尔也凑不成，最后，才由迈耶打着“中间”的旗帜出来了。他一方面以积极促成修改宪法的允诺来取得戴高乐派的支持；另一方面，又以保证努力争取使“欧洲军条约”获得议会通过来维持与人民共和党之间暧味的“合作”，同时表示继续推行比内所没有能够成功的经济政策，取得所谓“温和独立派”的信任。迈耶就是这样以左右逢源的手段拼凑成它在议会中所必要的多数的。但是法国人民绝对不会支持这样的一个政府。当迈耶要实行在其施政纲领中所揭橥的政治、外交和经济的反动措施，进一步向法国人民的民主、自由和生活权利进攻的时候，也就必然要遭到人民的猛烈反对和打击。在人民的强大压力下，议会中支持政府的多数集团也就不可免地要分崩离析了。
    迈耶内阁上台了，摆在它面前的是一大摊困难的财政经济问题。他拿什么来维持庞大的军事开支、减少预算的赤字呢？他拿什么来挽救法郎免于破产呢？他拿什么来平息法国人民对于统治集团的灾难政策的不满情绪呢？比内的“试验”已失败了，迈耶的“试验”难道就能成功？法国共产党最近发表的声明已反映了法国人民的一致愿望，他们要求成立一个执行和平与民族独立政策的政府。迈耶的政府不是这样的政府，它绝对不能把法国从灾难的深渊中拯救出来，因此它也绝对不会是一个稳定的政府。
