    Old Shen Builds a Kang
    To the Editor: My name is Wang Guirong, and I am a 57-year-old woman living in Wangshibei Village, Jin County, Hebei Province. My eldest son, Jixiang, gloriously sacrificed his life fighting the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan. My second son, Jiqing, is now fighting the American devils in Korea. I am the only one left at home. The village takes very good care of me. The land in my family is cultivated by an expert farmer named Old Shen. Last year's harvest was excellent: the cotton yield was 430 jin per mu, the yams grew as big as small pillows, and the grain harvested, after deducting the public grain, is enough for me to eat for three years.
    There is also something else that makes me indescribably happy: Last summer, in order to make my crops grow strong, Old Shen discussed with me and removed the kang (platform bed) and used the earth for the fields. In September, when the weather slowly turned cooler, Old Shen saw that I was still sleeping on the bed and quickly took some adobe bricks to help me build a kang. Unexpectedly, just as the bricks were drying, there was a heavy rain at night. Old Shen, afraid that the bricks would be damaged by the rain and delay the building of the kang, rolled up his own straw mat and groped in the dark for more than three miles to cover the bricks. Because he was old, and the road was slippery, he fell three times on the way, and his whole body was soaked. The next day, before it was light, Old Shen went out in the rain again to check on the bricks. Afraid that the bricks touching the ground would get wet, he piled some soil around them before returning home with peace of mind. As soon as the rain stopped, he pulled the bricks back and built the kang in one go. People in the village praised Old Shen for being strong and energetic in his old age, and for being increasingly vigorous, and for his high enthusiasm in taking care of the military's family members. I happily invited Old Shen to eat. He refused, saying, "Doing this little bit of work is nothing compared to the hardship Jiqing endures fighting the American devils in Korea!" I was so grateful that I couldn't say anything, and didn't know what to do. After thinking for a long time, I asked my nephew Yinle to write a letter to the People's Daily on my behalf, asking the editors to publish it so that everyone would know about this. Wang Guirong

    老慎垒炕
    编辑同志：俺叫王贵荣，是一个五十七岁的妇女，家住在河北晋县王石碑庄村。我大儿子吉祥，在抗日战争中和敌人作战时光荣牺牲了。二儿子吉庆，现在朝鲜打美国鬼子。家里只留下我一个人。村里对我照顾得十分周到。我家的土地由一个名叫老慎的种地能手给代耕着。去年收成可好：棉花每亩摘了四百三十斤，山药长得像小枕头似的，打下的粮食除交公粮外，够我吃三年。
    还有一件事叫俺说不出的高兴：去年夏天，老慎为了使俺的庄稼长的强，就和我商量着把炕拆了，上了地。到了九月里，天气慢慢凉了，老慎见我还睡在床上，就赶忙脱了一些坯，准备帮我垒炕。没想到坯刚干时，夜间下来了大雨。老慎怕把坯淋坏了，误了垒炕，就卷了自己铺着的草衫，摸黑跑了三里多地去盖坯。因为他上了年纪，再加上路滑，来回摔倒了三次，全身也被淋了个水溼。第二天天还不明，老慎又冒雨去看坯。他怕挨着地的坯湿了，还在周围壅了些土，才放心地回来了。雨一停，他就把坯拉回来，一口气就把炕垒上了。村里的人们都夸奖老慎年老筋骨壮，越老越强健，照顾军属的热情高。俺喜欢得叫老慎吃饭。他拒绝了，说：“干这点活算得了什么，比起吉庆在朝鲜打美国鬼子的辛苦来还差得多哩！”俺感谢得说不出话来，不知怎样才好。想了半天，才让我的侄儿银乐代笔把这件事写封信给人民日报，请编辑同志发表出来，让大家知道这件事。王贵荣
