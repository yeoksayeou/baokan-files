    "Evergreen Writing Teaching Method" Has Great Effect
    Comrade Editor: I am a language teacher at a certain military cadre school. In the past month or so, I have been trying to use the "Evergreen Writing Teaching Method" for teaching. Facts have proven that this method is a great innovation in language teaching, and the effect is very good. The students have made great progress in their writing. Student Zhang Changyong joined the army in 1947. Before joining the army, he studied in a private school for three years, elementary school for one year, and a simplified normal school for one year. Because he was in a guerrilla area, he did not study well. He started learning Chinese last October. Before adopting the Evergreen writing teaching method, he always felt it difficult to write. Each article was only five or six hundred words, the content was empty, and the words and sentences were not fluent. After learning Evergreen's method, he could write articles of nearly three thousand words, with vivid content and rich vocabulary, truly like a short story. There are quite a few people like him. Facts have proven that worker-peasant cadres have rich life experience and a lot of vocabulary, and they can write excellent articles with just a little inspiration. In the past, I always felt that there were too many unreadable sentences and the content was dull when I corrected compositions; now, every time I correct compositions, I feel like I am reading a novel, and many of the events in them have deeply educated me.

    “常青写作教学法”作用大
    编辑同志：我是某军事干部学校的一个语文教员，在最近一个多月来，尽量采用“常青写作教学法”进行教学。事实证明，这个方法对语文教学是一个极大的革新，效果非常好，同学们作文有了极大进步。学员张长勇，一九四七年参军，参军前读过三年私塾，一年高小，一年简师，因是在游击区，都没有好好学。去年十月开始学语文，在采用常青写作教学法前，他老感到作文困难，每篇写五六百字，内容空洞，词句不通，在学习常青的办法后，能写近三千字的文章，内容生动，语汇丰富，真像一篇短篇小说。像他这样的人并不少。事实证明，工农干部生活经验丰富，语汇甚多，只要加以启发就可写出极好的文章。从前我改作文老感到不通句子太多、内容枯燥无味；现在每次改作文都像在看小说，其中许多事迹深深地教育了我。钱听涛
