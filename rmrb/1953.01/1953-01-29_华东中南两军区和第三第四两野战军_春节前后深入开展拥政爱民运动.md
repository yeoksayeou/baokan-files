Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th. The Political Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued instructions on carrying out work to support the government and cherish the people around the Spring Festival. The instructions require all units in East China to conduct widespread propaganda and education on supporting the government and cherishing the people during the current affairs education and Party Day activities in February, and during various gatherings during the Spring Festival holidays, in order to continue to promote the fine traditions of the people's army and further strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the people and the army. Through propaganda and education, all personnel should clearly recognize that carrying out in-depth movements to support the government and cherish the people and strengthening the unity between the army and the people is of particularly great significance for consolidating national defense, smashing the enemy's conspiracy to expand the war of aggression, and defending the construction of the motherland and world peace. The instructions require all units to conduct a major inspection of mass discipline with the assistance of the local people's government and mass organizations. Personnel of troops and military organs stationed in cities should also check on compliance with public order, public health, and traffic regulations. Organs above the regiment level should conduct a serious inspection of the handling of letters from the masses and the reception of the masses. All units should formulate practical and feasible systems and methods for strictly abiding by mass discipline and doing a good job in handling letters and visits from the masses in the future. The instructions require all units to organize commanders and fighters to actively participate in various activities to support the government and cherish the people during the Spring Festival. The instructions finally pointed out that all commanders and fighters of the East China Army must be more vigilant and closely guard national defense while celebrating the Spring Festival.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th. The Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have decided to launch a "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month" throughout the region from January 26 to February 28. The Political Department of the Central South Military Region said in supplementary instructions: The entire army should use the "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month" to publicize to the troops the achievements of national construction in the past three years and the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of the people, carry out education to support the people's government and cherish the people, and clarify the current situation and tasks in order to defend the motherland's large-scale economic construction. During the "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month," the Central South Military Region will invite the heads of the Wuhan and Guangzhou Municipal People's Governments and local labor models to give reports to the troops, and broadcast these reports to the entire army. Local garrisons should invite local Party and government cadres, representatives of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families, and labor models to give reports to the troops or hold discussions. The instructions also require all units to conduct a mass discipline inspection based on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention while carrying out education to support the government and cherish the people. All levels of leading organs should carefully inspect the handling of letters from the people and their requests. After the inspection, commendations, criticisms, and punishments should be carried out in conjunction with education to support the government and cherish the people. In the inspection work, the method of holding symposiums with representatives from all walks of life should be used to extensively solicit opinions from local Party and government organs and mass organizations. All units should hold army-civilian get-togethers during the Spring Festival, organize special personnel to comfort the wounded and sick, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and extensively carry out recreational activities.
