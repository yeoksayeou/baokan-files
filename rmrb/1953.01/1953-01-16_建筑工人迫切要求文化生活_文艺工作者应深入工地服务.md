    Construction Workers Urgently Demand Cultural Life; Literary and Art Workers Should Go Deep into Construction Sites to Serve
    To the Editor: The broad masses of construction workers urgently demand cultural life. However, this reasonable demand of theirs has not been met.
    As far as I know, film screening and drama performance departments in North China and other places have rarely engaged in activities at construction sites in the past. Most construction sites are in relatively remote locations, making it difficult for workers to watch movies or dramas. For example, the worker dormitory construction site outside Zhongshanmen in Tianjin has more than 5,000 workers. This construction site is fifty li round trip from the city, making it very difficult for workers to see movies and dramas. However, cinemas and theaters in various locations have many audiences, especially on Sundays. It is rare for workers to come to the city once, and it is also difficult to buy tickets. The workers at the various construction sites of the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company in Beijing planned to go to the city to see movies at the end of last year, but the workers in the fifth work area did not buy tickets until January 4th this year. Some work areas have not yet bought tickets. The cultural and educational departments of some trade unions have also failed to provide good service to construction workers. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Taiyuan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions both have film projection teams that often screen films for other industrial workers, but have never engaged in activities at construction sites.
    In addition, construction workers also need some simple construction technical reference books and other popular reading materials, but the book publishing departments in various places generally do not go to construction sites. Construction workers have little rest time, and usually do not have free time to go to the city to buy books, which of course greatly limits the workers' enthusiasm for learning.
    Why have these problems not been resolved for a long time? I believe that the main reason is that the cultural publishing agencies and the cultural and educational departments of trade unions of local people's governments have not taken practical actions to serve basic construction and have neglected these demands of construction workers. I hope that all departments will pay attention to the demands of construction workers from now on and extend their respective businesses to construction sites. Li Xin

### 建筑工人迫切要求文化生活  文艺工作者应深入工地服务

    建筑工人迫切要求文化生活
    文艺工作者应深入工地服务
    编辑同志：广大建筑工人迫切要求文化生活。但是，他们这个合理的要求一直没有得到满足。
    据我所知，华北等地的各电影放映和戏剧演出部门，过去很少到建筑工地去活动。建筑工地大部分在比较偏僻的地方，工人们要想看电影或戏剧都很困难。如天津市中山门外工人宿舍工地，一共有五千多名工人。这个工地到市区来回五十里，工人看电影和戏剧就很不容易。而各地电影院和剧场观众都很多，特别是星期日，工人难得进城一次，也很难买到票。北京市华北基本建设工程公司各工地的工人，在去年年底就计划进城去看回电影，但第五工区的工人一直到今年一月四日才买到票，其他工区有的到现在还没买到票。有些工会的文教部门，也没很好地为建筑工人服务。像山西省总工会和太原市总工会都有电影放映队，经常为其他产业工人放映电影，但从来没有到建筑工地去活动过。
    另外，建筑工人也很需要一些浅近的建筑技术工具书和其他通俗读物，但各地书刊发行部门一般的都没有到工地去。建筑工人的休息时间少，平时又没有空闲时间进城去买书，这当然大大地限制了工人的学习热情。
    这些问题为什么长期未得解决呢？我认为主要是因为各地人民政府的文化出版机关和工会的文教部门还没有以实际行动为基本建设服务，忽视了建筑工人的这些要求。希望各个部门从今以后重视建筑工人的要求，把各自的业务开展到建筑工地中去。  黎　欣
