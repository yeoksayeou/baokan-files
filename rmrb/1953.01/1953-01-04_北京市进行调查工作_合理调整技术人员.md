Beijing is conducting investigation work and rationally adjusting technical personnel.

The relevant departments in Beijing are continuing the work of rationally adjusting technical personnel. Since the *People's Daily* published the editorial "Put Specialized Technical Talents in the Positions Most Needed for Economic Construction" on June 14th of last year, the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Personnel Bureau have jointly conducted three investigations and made partial adjustments, returning 49 technical cadres to economic construction posts. For example, Leng Lin, former Minister of Propaganda of the Fourteenth District Committee of the CPC Beijing Municipality, who had studied chemistry in the past, has now been transferred to the post of Director of the Xinhua Reagent Research Institute of the Local State-Owned Beijing Chemical Industry Company; Song Ruifen, the former Secretary of the Seventh District Committee of the CPC Beijing Municipality, who originally studied civil engineering and architecture, has now been decided to be transferred to be responsible for the design work of architectural engineering.

The work of rationally adjusting technical personnel in Beijing has been hampered because the leadership has not been tight enough in the past, and especially because some responsible cadres in certain departments have been thinking about departmentalism. Up to now, only about 20% of the technical cadres who should have "returned to their teams" in the city have done so, so that many technical cadres have not been able to fully exert their abilities.

Recently, the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre work conference. The conference specifically discussed how to continue to adjust technical cadres. Everyone realized the importance of this work to our country's large-scale economic construction. Therefore, the conference decided to conduct a final investigation throughout the city and make all the technical cadres who should be adjusted be fully adjusted by the end of January 1953, so that they can return to the posts most needed for economic construction.

    北京市进行调查工作
    合理调整技术人员
    北京市各有关部门正继续进行合理调整技术人员的工作。自从去年六月十四日人民日报发表了“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论以后，中国共产党北京市委员会组织部和北京市人民政府人事局曾共同进行了三次调查，并作了部分的调整，使四十九个技术干部，回到经济建设的岗位上。例如前中共北京市第十四区委员会宣传部部长冷林，过去曾经学过化学，现已调任地方国营北京市化学工业公司新华试剂研究所所长；原来学土木建筑工程的前中共北京市第七区委员会书记宋汝棼，现已决定调出负责建筑工程的设计工作。
    北京市合理调整技术人员的工作，由于过去领导方面抓得不够紧，特别是由于某些部门负责干部存在着本位主义的思想，使调整工作受到了阻碍，到目前为止，全市已经“归队”了的技术干部只占应该“归队”的技术干部总数的百分之二十强，以致许多技术干部还不能充分发挥他们的能力。
    最近，中共北京市委员会组织部召开干部工作会议，在会议上曾专门讨论了如何继续进行调整技术干部的问题，大家都认识到了这项工作对我们国家大规模经济建设的重要意义，因此会议决定在全市进行一次最后的调查，并在一九五三年一月底将使所有应该调整的技术干部全部调整完毕，使他们回到经济建设最需要的岗位上去。
