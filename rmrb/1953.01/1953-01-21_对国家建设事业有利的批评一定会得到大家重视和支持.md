    Criticism Beneficial to National Construction Will Surely Receive Attention and Support
    To the Editor: After the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page published my letter of criticism, "Yangquan Mining Bureau Should Improve Coal Mine Inspection Work," on December 6th last year, it immediately received attention from the leadership of the Yangquan Mining Bureau and support from the workers. The Mining Bureau issued instructions on December 12th last year, notifying all mines to immediately improve the pithead inspection standards. The sales department also held a meeting, designating this work as one of the current important tasks.
    This incident has taught me that as long as the problems reflected are beneficial to the national construction and the people, they will surely receive attention and support. In the future, I am determined to pay more attention to the national construction, actively reflect the work situation and the opinions of the workers to the Party newspaper. Yao Butang

    对国家建设事业有利的批评一定会得到大家重视和支持
    编辑同志：去年十二月六日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表了我写的“阳泉矿务局应改进坑口检收工作”的批评信以后，立刻得到了阳泉矿务局领导方面的重视和工人群众的支持。矿务局已在去年十二月十二日发出指示，通知各矿立即改进坑口检收标准。销售部门同时也召开了会议，把这一项工作定为当前重要任务之一。
    这个事情教育了我：只要反映的问题对国家建设事业和人民是有利的，就一定会得到重视和支持。今后我决心要更加关心国家建设事业，积极地向党报反映工作中的情况和工人群众的意见。 姚步堂
