    Some Experiences of Soviet Local Newspapers in Integrating Theory with Practice and Connecting with the Masses in Industrial Reporting
    Bao Ding, Jiang Hong

    Foreword

    Our country has completed the task of restoring the national economy, and large-scale economic construction is beginning. Our newspapers must be fully prepared ideologically and organizationally to become active assistants to the Party and the government in completing this new historical task. Our enterprise departments, mass organizations, and Party organizations should also make full use of the weapon of the newspaper to promote economic construction.

    Here, based on Comrade Goncharov's book "Local Newspapers Fighting to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule," we introduce some experiences of Soviet local newspapers in industrial reporting during the post-war Five-Year Plan period. This can serve not only as a reference for how newspapers can strengthen industrial reporting but also as a reference for how various enterprise departments can use newspapers to strengthen industrial propaganda. What is worth our reference is not only the specific methods proposed but also the mass line ideology and work style embodied in these methods.

    Soviet newspapers operate according to the principles instructed by Lenin. This principle is well known: "A newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator but also a collective organizer."

    In the propaganda and reporting of the post-war Five-Year Plan, Soviet newspapers followed the instructions and resolutions of the Party. In the "Resolution on the Propaganda and Agitation Work of Party Organizations After the Adoption of the Five-Year Plan for the Restoration and Development of the Soviet National Economy for 1946-1950," the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed newspaper editorial departments to explain the general tasks of the Five-Year Plan to the workers; to constantly use concrete examples to clarify the completion of production plans in various sectors of the national economy; to widely disseminate the experiences of advanced individuals in socialist competition, promote excellent production organization methods that ensure increased labor productivity, and the latest achievements in science and technology. While publicizing the experiences of advanced enterprises and collective farms, newspapers must bravely criticize the shortcomings in the work of backward enterprises and collective farms.

    In 1946, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed the "Resolution on Improving the Methods of the State Newspapers 'Hammer' (Rostov-on-Don), 'Volga Commune' (Kuybyshev), and 'Kursk Truth'," which pointed out that the most important responsibility of newspapers is to "constantly explain the new tasks of the new Five-Year Plan, mobilize the working masses to complete and exceed the Five-Year Plan... The newspaper should use vivid and convincing examples to show the prospects for the economic and cultural development of the province, to show the ways and means to improve labor productivity in the basic sectors of the national economy, to fight for the most rapid development of the leading economic sectors, to publicize the experiences of production innovators, advanced enterprises, and collective farms, to organize Bolshevik criticism of the shortcomings in the work of Party, Soviet, trade union, and economic organs, and to point out the ways to overcome the difficulties encountered in solving economic and political tasks."

    Soviet local newspapers fulfilled the tasks set out in the Party's instructions in their reporting during the post-war Five-Year Plan period. The content of the newspaper's industrial reporting was rich and lively. Their experience is instructive for our current industrial reporting. It should be especially pointed out that Soviet newspapers have accumulated effective experiences in connecting with the masses and integrating theory with practice in conducting industrial reporting. Whether it is for the propaganda of the Five-Year Plan, for the propaganda of socialist competition, for the propaganda of economic knowledge, or for the struggle for the progress of science and technology, for the struggle for the excellent quality of products, for the struggle for the improvement of the economic indicators of enterprise work, and in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, they maintain close contact with the masses and widely absorb the participation of the masses in all aspects of newspaper work.

    Their mass work is carried out in a wide range of ways, in a variety of ways, and is very lively and powerful. They go deep into real life, deep into production work, and establish various direct and indirect contacts with various people, and are not limited to written contact with correspondents' submissions. They attach great importance to the suggestions of the masses and transform those creative suggestions into a huge force to promote production. This style of closely connecting with the masses, and the lively ways and methods of mass work, enable the Soviet newspapers to effectively play the role of 'collective organizer' - and this is the fine tradition of the Soviet newspapers since Lenin and Stalin founded Pravda.

    If we not only know some of the guiding principles of Soviet newspapers in principle, but also specifically understand some of the mass work methods and experiences of Soviet newspapers, it will inspire us in strengthening the mass character of newspapers and improving the efforts of mass work of newspapers.

    Goncharov's pamphlet, which specializes in industrial reporting in newspapers, was compiled by studying materials published in various Soviet state newspapers, regional newspapers, and republic newspapers in 1948 and 1949 during the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan period, as well as materials from several newspaper editorial offices. This article is compiled by us based on the above-mentioned purpose, focusing on the mass work of newspapers, based on the materials in Goncharov's pamphlet. These experiences are of reference value to our newspapers, not only in studying how to connect with reality and the masses in industrial reporting, but also in studying the content of industrial reporting.

    I. Correspondence from Stakhanovite Workers

    The socialist competition of the Soviet working people plays a primary role in the victorious struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Thanks to the Party's daily leadership, socialist competition has become a nationwide character, with more than ninety percent of workers, technical staff, and employees participating in the competition.

    Creative suggestions and patriotic actions of the Soviets have opened up broad prospects for newspapers. Everything new and advanced that happens in the Soviet Union every day due to the patriotic initiative of the laborers is quickly reflected in the newspaper and immediately becomes the property of all the people. Newspapers constantly elucidate the progress of socialist competition, collect, publish, and disseminate the advanced experience of Stakhanovite workers. At the same time, the newspaper waged a resolute struggle against everything old that hindered progress in the development of socialist competition and the early completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan.

    Soviet newspapers work in accordance with the instructions of Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin pointed out: Newspapers should reflect the situation: how the competition is being conducted by the masses themselves, what experiences the millions of working people have in signing contracts and implementing the competition, and how the working people regard the competition as their own cause.

    In reporting and promoting socialist competition, Soviet local newspapers closely connected with the masses and flexibly used various methods.

    The Kuybyshev Oblast state newspaper "Volga Commune" carried out effective work in disseminating the experience of advanced workers in socialist competition. Newspaper editors quickly coordinated and disseminated the valuable initiatives of Stakhanovite workers.

    In 1948, industrial workers in Kuybyshev Oblast wrote to Comrade Stalin, promising to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule, to ensure the continuous increase in production, and to guarantee the state no less than 265 million rubles of over-plan accumulation. The Kuybyshev people called on workers in enterprises in cities along the Volga River to engage in socialist competition.

    Following the initiative of the "Volga Commune" newspaper, the column "Response to Labor in Cities Along the Volga River" was opened in several state newspapers. The column took the achievements in production and the experiences of workers in cities such as Kuybyshev, Gorky, Stalingrad, Saratov, Ulyanovsk, and Kazan in the struggle for over-planned accumulation and mobilizing reserve forces in production as the theme to publish special issues. The newspaper systematically elucidated the situation of competition between the states, and publicized the results of the work of those participating in the competition. The newspaper editorial department organized the exchange of materials between the editorial departments of the Volga River newspapers. Therefore, the exchange pages of the Saratov newspaper "Communist" and "Stalingrad Truth," "Gorky Commune," and other newspapers were published in the "Volga Commune." The Saratov people reported on the experience of fighting to reduce production costs, the Stalingrad people talked about the significance of worker accounting for savings, and the Gorky people introduced the working experience of rationalization proposers and inventors to the Kuybyshev people. The enterprises in Kuybyshev City and Kuybyshev Oblast widely discussed the exchange pages in the newspaper, which caused positive reactions. The "Volga Commune" itself organized materials on the competition situation in Kuybyshev enterprises for the newspapers.

    The "Volga Commune" also used an effective method of publicizing production experience - correspondence from Stakhanovite workers. This correspondence helped the development and consolidation of the production ties between the Stakhanovite workers of Kuybyshev and Moscow, Leningrad, and the cities along the Volga River.

    Nikolai Smirnov, an excellent technician at the Kuybyshev "Kadk" factory, organized Stakhanovite collective work in his work department. He wrote a letter to the famous domestic technician Nikolai Losisk about this matter and raised a series of questions for discussion in the letter. Smirnov's letter and Losisk's letter were subsequently published in the newspaper continuously. This correspondence aroused great interest in enterprises everywhere and promoted the widespread adoption of the Stakhanovite collective labor method. This friendly connection and exchange of production experience further enriched the innovators and helped them to complete production tasks more smoothly. The following is a letter from technician Losisk: "Dear Nikolai Vasilievich:

    It has been a year since we started communicating and since you came to Moscow to visit the micrometer section of the 'Garibe' factory where I work. A year—a short period of time, but what a huge change has taken place here in this short period!…

    A year ago, my work section was the only department that carried out Stakhanovite collective labor, but now nine workshops in the factory have become Stakhanovite workshops.…

    I am concerned about your progress. I have noticed with pleasure how the 'Kadk' factory has changed from a backward enterprise of the Soviet Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry to an advanced enterprise in the recent year! This is where the exchange of production experience has played a decisive role. Here I express my joy for your achievements. This admirable cause is keeping pace with the times. This method, which requires a high degree of culture, intelligence, and effectiveness from technicians, is undoubtedly beneficial to the production cause.

    Finally, it should be pointed out that our correspondence on exchanging production experience will achieve higher results in socialist competition.

    Let us warmly develop the competition of technicians throughout the Soviet Union!

    Shake hands tightly.
            Old technician Nikolai Losisk of the 'Garibe' factory"

    The Kuybyshev Voroshilov factory fast lathe operator Hua Xin and Leningrad lathe operator, Stalin Prize winner Barkevich, conducted the same correspondence in the newspaper. Several workers, engineers, and technicians from Kuybyshev City also went to Leningrad to learn about the progress of the famous fast lathe. The correspondence between Stakhanovite workers and their meeting played a significant role in the widespread adoption of fast metal cutting methods.

    Correspondence from Stakhanovite workers in various cities along the Volga River on socialist competition, and correspondence between Kuybyshev oil workers and Baku oil workers, are being carried out on a wide scale.

    The newspaper also conducted correspondence between the Kuybyshev Stakhanovite worker and Alexander Chutkykh, a nationally renowned Moscow textile worker. When Kuybyshev had just received news of Chutkykh's initiative, the editorial department immediately held a meeting of work team leaders in urban enterprises. Rukanova, the work team leader of the sewing workshop of the "Red Star" factory, who attended the meeting, suggested organizing a discussion on the issue of production quality in the "Volga Commune" newspaper. She said: "Workers, work team leaders, and technicians have raised many interesting and important questions. I hope that Alexander Chutkykh - the initiator of the high-quality production movement, will tell about his experience in the newspaper."

    The editorial department notified Alexander Chutkykh of the unanimously endorsed proposal at the meeting. The "Volga Commune" quickly received his reply from Moscow. The editorial department immediately published a report by Alexander Chutkykh entitled "Letter to Kuybyshev Work Team Leaders" in the "Lecture on Production Quality" column of the "Volga Commune" newspaper. After that, the correspondence between the two sides continued.

    The important initiative of Gubaishevsk Stakhanovite workers Maria Lozhneva and Likin Gononinko to save raw materials was widely reflected in local enterprises. The Kuybyshev people launched a movement to save and cherish raw materials. The work team of the Kuybyshev sanitary clothing factory, Comrade Aldonova and Comrade Koroleva, a Stakhanovite seamstress at the Chapaev sewing factory, also wrote to the textile workers of Gubaishevsk through the "Volga Commune" newspaper, asking them to report on their experiences. Maria Lozhneva and Likin Gononinko provided complete opinions on the issue of saving raw materials in their reply.

    This correspondence from Stakhanovite workers enabled the Stakhanovite workers of Kuybyshev to gain richer production experience. The propaganda of the achievements of outstanding national figures enabled the initiative of the Stakhanovite workers in Kuybyshev industry to be greatly developed.

    苏联地方报纸在进行工业报道中联系实际联系群众的一些经验
    鲍碇　江虹
    前　言
    我们国家已经完成了恢复国民经济的任务，大规模的经济建设正在开始。我们的报纸要有充分的思想准备与组织准备，以求在完成这一新的历史任务中成为党与政府的积极助手。我们的企业部门、群众团体和党组织也应该尽量利用报纸这一武器来推动经济建设。
    在这里，我们根据苏联冈察洛夫同志所著的“为争取提前完成五年计划而斗争的地方报纸”一书，介绍苏联地方报纸在战后五年计划时期工业报道中的若干经验，这不只是可以作为报纸如何加强工业报道的参考，也可以作为各企业部门如何利用报纸加强工业宣传的参考；值得我们参考的还不只限于其中所提出的具体办法，而且在于从这些办法中所体现出来的群众路线的思想方法和工作作风。
    苏联报纸是按照列宁的指示底原则进行工作的。这个原则就是大家所熟知的：“报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且还是集体的组织者。”
    苏联报纸在战后五年计划的宣传报道中，遵照着党的指示和决议。在“关于通过一九四六年至一九五○年恢复和发展苏联国民经济五年计划后党组织的宣传鼓动工作”的决议中，联共中央指示报刊的编辑部要向劳动者解释五年计划的总任务；要经常用具体事例去阐明国民经济各部门生产计划的完成；要广泛地传播社会主义竞赛中先进者的经验，推广能保证提高劳动生产率的优良的生产组织方法，以及科学与技术的最新成就。和宣传先进的企业与集体农庄的经验同时，报纸必须勇敢地批评那些落后企业与集体农庄中的工作缺点。
    一九四六年，联共中央通过了“关于改善州报‘铁鎚报’（顿河岸上罗斯多夫城）、‘伏尔加公社报’（古比雪夫城）与‘库尔斯克真理报’的方法”的决议，决议中指出报纸最重要的责任是“经常解释新五年计划的各项新任务，动员劳动群众来完成和超过五年计划。……报纸应当用鲜明的和令人信服的例子来表明州的经济文化发展前途，表明国民经济基本部门中提高劳动生产率的途径和手段，为主导的经济部门最迅速发展而斗争，宣传生产革新者、先进企业和集体农庄的经验，组织对党、苏维埃、职工会和经济机关的工作缺点的布尔什维克的批评，指出克服在解决经济政治任务中所遇到的困难的途径。”
    苏联地方报纸在战后五年计划时期的报道中，执行了党的指示中所提出的任务。报纸关于工业报道的内容，是丰富而生动的。他们的经验，对于我们当前要进行的工业报道，有启发作用。尤其应该指出的是，苏联报纸在进行工业报道中，积累了有效的联系群众、联系实际的经验。他们无论是对于五年计划的宣传、对于社会主义竞赛的宣传、对于经济知识的宣传，或者是为科学与技术的进步而斗争、为产品的优良质量而斗争、为企业工作的经济指标的改善而斗争，以及在开展批评与自我批评方面，都和群众保持密切的联系，广泛地吸收各方面的群众参加报纸工作。
    他们的群众工作是在广泛的范围内以多种多样的方式进行的，非常活泼有力。他们深入实际生活，深入生产工作，和多方面的人物取得各种直接的、间接的联系，而不局限于与通讯员信稿往返的书面联系。他们十分重视群众的建议，并把那些创造性的建议变为巨大的推动生产前进的力量。这种密切联系群众的作风，和生动的群众工作的方式方法，使苏联报纸有效地发挥‘集体的组织者’的作用——而这正是列宁、斯大林创办真理报以来的苏联报纸的优良传统。
    我们如果不仅仅是从原则上知道一些苏联报纸的领导原则，而且具体地了解一些苏联报纸的群众工作方法与经验，将对我们在加强报纸的群众性、提高报纸的群众工作的努力中有所启发。
    冈察洛夫这本专门论述报纸的工业报道的小册子，是研究了苏联战后五年计划时期一九四八年和一九四九年发表在苏联各州报、边区报和共和国报纸上的材料以及若干报纸编辑部的材料而编写的。这篇文章，是我们根据上述宗旨，以报纸的群众工作为中心，依据冈察洛夫这本小册子中的材料编写的。这些经验，对于我们的报纸来说，不仅在研究工业报道中如何联系实际、联系群众问题方面，而且在研究工业报道的内容方面，同样有参考价值。
    一、斯塔哈诺夫工作者的通讯
    苏联劳动人民的社会主义竞赛，在为提前完成战后五年计划的胜利斗争中起着首要的作用。由于党的日常的领导，使社会主义竞赛成为全民的性质，百分之九十以上的工人、技术工作人员和职员参加了竞赛。
    创造性的建议和苏维埃人爱国主义的行动，替报纸开辟了广阔的前途。由于劳动者爱国主义的倡议而在苏联天天发生的一切新的、先进的事物，很快地在报纸上得到反映，并立刻成为全体人民的财产。报纸经常阐明社会主义竞赛的进程，搜集、公布、传播斯塔哈诺夫工作者的先进经验。同时，报纸向一切陈旧的，在发展社会主义竞赛、提前完成战后五年计划的道路上障碍着前进的事物，作坚决的斗争。
    苏联的报纸是按照斯大林同志的指示而工作的。斯大林同志指出：报纸应该反映这种情况：竞赛怎样为群众自己进行着，千万劳动群众在签订合同、实现竞赛的时候有些什么体验，劳动群众怎样将竞赛视为自己切身的事业。
    苏联地方报纸在报道和推进社会主义竞赛中，密切联系群众，灵活地运用了各种方式。
    古比雪夫州州报“伏尔加公社报”对于社会主义竞赛中先进工作者的经验的传布，进行了有效的工作。报纸编辑部人员迅速地配合并传播了斯塔哈诺夫工作者的有价值的倡议。
    古比雪夫州工业工作人员曾在一九四八年给斯大林同志的信中，保证提前完成本年的计划，保证生产品的不断增加，保证给国家不下于两亿六千五百万卢布的超计划的积累。古比雪夫人号召伏尔加河沿岸各城市企业工人进行社会主义竞赛。
    按照“伏尔加公社报”的倡议，在若干州报上开辟了“伏尔加沿岸城市劳动的呼应”栏。该栏以生产中得到的成绩，和古比雪夫、高尔基、斯大林格勒、萨拉托夫、乌里扬诺夫斯克及喀山等城市劳动者在为超计划的积累及动员生产的后备力量而斗争的经验作为主题来出版专号。报纸有系统地阐明了各州间竞赛的情形，宣传了参加竞赛者工作的结果。报纸编辑部组织了伏尔加沿岸各报编辑部间材料的交换工作。因此，在“伏尔加公社报”上刊载了萨拉托夫的报纸“共产主义者”和“斯大林格勒真理报”、“高尔基公社报”等报的交换之页。萨拉托夫人报道了降低生产成本的斗争经验，斯大林格勒人讲述了工人记名账对于节约的意义，高尔基人向古比雪夫人介绍了合理化建议者和发明者的工作经验。古比雪夫城和古比雪夫州的企业广泛地讨论了报纸上的交换之页，并引起了积极的反映。“伏尔加公社报”本身则为各报组织了古比雪夫企业中竞赛情形的材料。
    “伏尔加公社报”更运用了一个宣传生产经验的有效的方法——斯塔哈诺夫工作者的通讯。这种通讯帮助了古比雪夫人和莫斯科、列宁格勒及伏尔加沿岸各城市的斯塔哈诺夫工作者在生产上的联系的发展与巩固。
    古比雪夫“卡得克”工厂优秀的技师尼古拉·斯米尔诺夫在自己的工作部门组织了斯塔哈诺夫式的集体工作，他把这件事写信告诉国内著名技师尼古拉·洛西斯克，并在信中提出一系列请求商榷的问题。斯米尔诺夫的信和洛西斯克的信以后都连续在报上发表了。这个通讯在各地企业内引起了很大的兴趣，并促进了斯塔哈诺夫式集体劳动的方法的广泛采用。这种友谊的联系和生产经验的交换，更加丰富了革新者并帮助他们更顺利地完成生产任务。　下面是技师洛西斯克的一封信：“敬爱的尼古拉·华西尔维奇：
    自从我们开始通讯以来，自从你到莫斯科来参观我在那里工作的‘加里贝’工厂的测微器工作段的工作以来，已经一年了。一年——一个短短的时期，然而这个短时期内我们这里发生了何等巨大的变革呀！……
    一年前我的工作段是唯一进行斯塔哈诺夫式集体劳动的部门，但现在工厂里的九间车间已成为斯塔哈诺夫车间了。……
    我关心着你们的进步。我以愉快的心情注意了‘卡得克’工厂是怎样从一个苏联汽车和拖拉机工业部的落后的企业，在最近的一年变成先进的企业的呀！这就是生产经验的交换起了决定的作用。这里我向你的成就表示高兴。这种值得摹仿的事业正与时俱进。这种需要技师高度的文化、机智和效能的方法，无疑地对生产事业是有益处的。
　最后要指出，我们关于交换生产经验的通讯将在社会主义竞赛中获得更高的成绩。
    让我们热烈地开展全苏的技师们的竞赛吧！
    紧紧地握手。
            ‘加里贝’工厂老技师尼古拉·洛西斯克”
    古比雪夫的伏罗希洛夫工厂快速镟工华新和列宁格勒镟工、斯大林奖金获得者巴尔开维奇在报纸上进行了同样的通讯。若干古比雪夫城的工人、工程师、技师并到列宁格勒了解了著名的快速镟床的进步情形。斯塔哈诺夫工作者的通讯和他们之间的见面，对于金属快速切削方法的广泛采用，起了不少的作用。
    伏尔加沿岸各城市关于社会主义竞赛的斯塔哈诺夫工作者的通讯，古比雪夫石油工人和巴库石油工人之间的通讯，都在广泛的范围内进行着。
    报纸上还进行了古比雪夫斯塔哈诺夫工作者和全国著名的莫斯科纺织工人亚历山大·丘脱基赫的通讯。当古比雪夫刚刚得到丘脱基赫的倡议消息的时候，编辑部立刻召开了城市企业里工作队长的会议。参加会议的“红星”工厂缝工车间工作队长鲁卡诺娃，建议在“伏尔加公社报”上组织关于生产质量问题的讨论，她说：“工人、工作队长、技师们提出许多有趣而重要的问题，希望亚历山大·丘脱基赫——优良质量生产运动的发起人在报纸上讲述他的经验。”
    编辑部把这个会议上一致赞同的提议，通知了亚历山大·丘脱基赫。“伏尔加公社报”很快地收到了他从莫斯科写来的答复。编辑部即在“伏尔加公社”报的“关于生产质量讲座”栏内发表亚历山大·丘脱基赫“告古比雪夫工作队长书”的一篇报告。之后双方的通讯连续地进行着。
    古白纹斯克斯塔哈诺夫工人玛丽亚·洛日聂瓦和里金·哥诺寗可的节约原料的重要倡议在地方企业内得到广泛的反映。古比雪夫人为节约和珍惜原料展开了运动。古比雪夫卫生衣工厂工作班在阿尔多诺娃同志和夏伯阳缝衣工厂斯塔哈诺夫女工柯洛莱娃同志也通过“伏尔加公社报”写信给古白纹斯克的纺织女工，要求他们报告自己的经验。玛丽亚·洛日聂瓦和里金·哥诺寗可在复信中对节省原料问题提供了完整的意见。
    这种斯塔哈诺夫工作者的通讯，使古比雪夫的斯塔哈诺夫工作者获得了更丰富的生产经验。国家优秀人物的成绩的宣传，使古比雪夫工业中斯塔哈诺夫工作者的倡议得以大大地发挥作用。
