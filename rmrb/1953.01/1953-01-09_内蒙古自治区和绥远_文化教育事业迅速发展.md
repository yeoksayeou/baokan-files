    The cultural and educational undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province are developing rapidly. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a total of 4,084 primary schools, with an average of one primary school in each Gacha (administrative village); more than 321,000 students, more than three and a half times the highest figure during the enemy and puppet rule; the number of students in secondary schools in the entire region has also increased more than ten times compared with the early days of liberation in 1947, with an average of four middle schools in each league; now the autonomous region has also opened two institutions of higher learning—Inner Mongolia Normal College and Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. A well-equipped Inner Mongolia University is also under preparation. More than 80 percent of the children of all ethnic laboring people in the region have entered schools, and most of them enjoy the preferential treatment of government scholarships. Students in Oroqen primary schools and Mongolian primary schools on the grasslands all enjoy public funding. More than 360,000 workers, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups have now entered spare-time cultural schools, winter schools and year-round civil schools. More than half of the herdsmen on the grasslands of the Xilin Gol League participated in Mongolian schools. In order to meet the needs of lamas in temples in the grasslands to study politics and culture, many lama schools have also been established in various places. In developing the Mongolian language, the Autonomous Region People's Government, in addition to regularly holding Mongolian teacher training courses, has also compiled a complete set of Mongolian primary school textbooks. In the past five years, it has compiled a total of 69 kinds of textbooks, published more than 1.24 million copies, and translated 225 kinds of Chairman Mao's works and other popular readings, publishing more than 440,000 copies. It has also published Mongolian newspapers and Mongolian pictorials, which have been warmly welcomed by the Mongolian people. In addition, the Autonomous Region has also established 17 cultural centers, 7 cinemas and 5 cultural troupes, and cultivated a group of Mongolian writers and actors, which has promoted the development of Mongolian music and dance art.
    Suiyuan Province has more than 4,700 primary schools with more than 290,000 primary school students, more than three times the number during the Kuomintang reactionary rule; ethnic middle schools and general middle schools have developed to 20, and now a normal college and a animal husbandry college have been established. In order to support the development of Mongolian education in Suiyuan Province, the Central People's Government allocated a special fund of 1.8 billion yuan last year as a subsidy for ethnic education for the clothing, food and medical care of poor Mongolian students. More than half of the Mongolian students in the Yikezhao League now enjoy public funding, and the number of Mongolian students in the league has increased more than seven times in the past two years.
