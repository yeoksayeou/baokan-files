Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th: Two American-Chiang Kai-shek spies, Jiang Zuqin and Zhong Xueyue, recently captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers, have confessed, once again exposing the truth about the U.S. aggressors' use of so-called "screening" to forcibly detain our captured personnel.

The American-Chiang Kai-shek spies Jiang Zuqin and Zhong Xueyue had successively served as squad leaders, company commanders, and security guards in the U.S.'s Geoje Island 72nd POW camp and Jeju Island's 1st and 3rd POW camps. On October 3, 1952, they were transferred to an American spy organization on Xianjia Island outside Incheon Port for training. On November 17, they disguised themselves as staff officers and reconnaissance personnel of a certain artillery unit of our Volunteer Army, and landed by boat in the Yanan Peninsula area on the west coast of Korea. They were captured by our army on the 18th.

According to Jiang Zuqin and Zhong Xueyue, the U.S. invading army, in order to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs as cannon fodder, carried out forced tattooing, blood fingerprinting, and large-scale massacres in the POW camps in the autumn and winter of 1951. In the spring of 1952, the U.S. side conducted illegal "screening" of our captured personnel in an attempt to cover up the crime of forcibly detaining POWs. The day before the "screening," under the instructions of the U.S. POW camp authorities, Wang Shunqing, the commander of the 72nd Special Task Force, who had received special training in Tokyo, and other accomplices, shamelessly deceived and threatened the POWs, saying: If they returned to mainland China, they would definitely be killed by the Communist Party; if they were willing to go to Taiwan, the Americans would send them to Jeju Island in the future, posing as refugees, and then transfer them to Taiwan. This way, the Americans could deny handing over the POWs to the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

That night, like ferocious demons, the American-Chiang Kai-shek spies interrogated the POWs one by one by battalion: "Who wants to return to the mainland?" The POWs who expressed their willingness to return to the mainland were beaten severely. In the 4th Battalion, Chiang Kai-shek's spy Zhang Ying even more inhumanely cut off the flesh of a POW who wanted to return to the mainland with a knife and rubbed chili powder on the wound. All the POWs who expressed their willingness to return to the motherland were gathered together, and some were beaten to death by the spies that night. Jiang Zuqin, who was then the squad leader of the 6th squad of the 2nd company of the 4th battalion of the 72nd Task Force, said that Li Daan, the deputy commander of the American-Chiang Kai-shek 72nd Task Force, personally interrogated a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteers. That captured person said: "I have a seventy-year-old mother, and I demand to return to the mainland. Is that against the law?" The wolf-hearted Li Daan, under the instructions of the Americans, chopped him to death with a knife, asking after each chop: "Do you still want to return to the mainland?" But each time the answer was: "Return to the mainland! Return to the mainland!"

The next day, when the formal "screening" was about to begin, Task Force commander Wang Shunqing once again intimidated the POWs, waving a shiny dagger in front of them and saying: "I won't force you if you want to return to the mainland, but this thing will let you down! Yesterday, in the 86th POW camp, those who wanted to return to the mainland were beaten to death before they even left the gate—thirty-some of them! We also took care of a few last night!" However, despite the various deceptions and intimidations carried out by the American POW camp authorities through their spies, when the Americans pretended to individually ask the POWs where they wanted to return, many POWs still bravely said: "Willing to return to the motherland!" Thereupon, they were driven onto trucks under the beating of sticks by the spies. Jiang Zuqin said that he later heard from a "Korean pastor" (of Korean nationality) sent by the U.S. side to the POW camp that these people were sent to the 61st POW camp that day, and the next day more than a hundred of them were shot and wounded by American soldiers with machine guns. Three or four days after the "screening" in the 72nd POW camp, Jiang Zuqin heard the sounds of machine guns and small cannons in the distance for almost the entire day. Later, that "Korean pastor" told him that this was because the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in another POW camp had been barbarously massacred by the American army for resolutely demanding repatriation, resulting in about three hundred deaths and injuries.

The confessions of American-Chiang Kai-shek spies Jiang Zuqin and Zhong Xueyue once again expose the criminal essence of the illegal resolutions on the Korean issue passed by the Seventh UN General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States, which serve the U.S.'s policy of bloody detention of POWs.

    志愿军捕获的两名美蒋特务供称
    美方阴谋把我方被俘人员交蒋李匪帮当炮灰
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】中国人民志愿军最近捕获了两名美蒋特务蒋祖钦和钟雪岳，这两个特务的供词又一次暴露了美国侵略者用所谓“甄别”来强迫扣留我方被俘人员的真相。
    美蒋特务蒋祖钦、钟雪岳曾先后在美方巨济岛第七十二号战俘营及济州岛第一、第三号战俘营充任小队长、中队长和警备队员。一九五二年十月三日，他们被调到仁川港外仙甲岛上的美国特务机关受训，十一月十七日他们伪装我志愿军某炮兵部队参谋和侦察员，乘船在朝鲜西海岸延安半岛地区潜行登陆，十八日即被我军捕获。
    据蒋祖钦和钟雪岳说，美国侵略军为了扣留我方被俘人员，将他们交给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮充当炮灰，在一九五一年秋天和冬天在战俘营中进行了强迫刺字、打血指印，大规模屠杀等各种暴行；一九五二年春天，美方又对我方被俘人员进行了非法“甄别”，企图以此掩饰强迫扣留战俘的罪行。在进行“甄别”以前一天，在美国战俘营当局的指令下，曾在东京受过专门训练的美蒋特务七十二联队联队长王顺清及其他爪牙，就无耻地欺骗和威胁战俘们说：如果他们回到中国大陆，一定要被共产党杀死；如果愿意到台湾去，将来美国人会把他们送到济州岛，冒充难民身份，然后转送到台湾，这样，美国人就可以不承认把战俘交给了蒋介石匪帮。
    这天夜里，凶神恶煞般的美蒋特务们以大队为单位，一个一个地逼问战俘：“谁要回大陆？”表示愿意回大陆的战俘们当时都遭到痛打。在第四大队，蒋匪特务张英更惨无人道地用刀子剜掉一位要回大陆的战俘身上的肉，还在伤口上擦上辣椒粉。所有表示愿意回祖国的战俘都被集中起来，有的人当夜就被特务们打死。特务蒋祖钦当时任七十二联队四大队二中队六小队小队长，他说，美蒋特务七十二联队副联队长李大安亲自逼问一位中国人民志愿军被俘人员，那位被俘人员说：“我有一个七十多岁的老娘，我要求回大陆，难道还犯法吗？”狼心狗肺的李大安就在美国人的指令下用刀活活将他剁死，每剁一刀还问一句：“你还回大陆不？”但每次的回答都是“回大陆！回大陆！”
    第二天，要进行正式“甄别”了，联队长王顺清又对战俘们进行再一次的恫吓，他在战俘们面前挥着一把雪亮的匕首说：“你们要回大陆，我也不勉强，就是这个家伙对你们不起！昨天八十六号战俘营里要回大陆的人连门口都没出就被打死了三十几个！昨夜我们也干掉了好几个！”但是，尽管美国战俘营当局指使特务们进行了各种欺骗和恫吓，当美国人装模作样地来个别询问战俘们愿意回到那里的时候，许多战俘仍勇敢地说：“愿意回祖国！”于是，他们就在特务们棍棒敲打下被赶上汽车载走了。蒋祖钦说，他后来听美方派到战俘营来的“韩牧师”（朝鲜籍）说，这些人当天被送到六十一号战俘营，第二天就被美国兵用机关枪打死打伤了一百多名。在七十二号战俘营进行“甄别”后三、四天，蒋祖钦曾听到远处的机枪声、小炮声响了差不多一整天。后来，那个“韩牧师”告诉他，这是另一个战俘营中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员因为坚决要求遣返，遭到美国军队的野蛮屠杀，死伤了约三百多人。
    美蒋特务蒋祖钦和钟雪岳的供词，再一次揭穿了第七届联合国大会在美国操纵下通过为美国血腥扣留战俘政策服务的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议的罪恶本质。
