The Story of Soda Water Heated by a Stove
　　　　Wang Shanfeng

　　In this severe winter, the Princess Ling Native Products Company in Jilin Province is still hoarding over 10,000 bottles of soda water. To prevent these soda bottles from freezing and breaking, they are specially heating them with stoves. However, at least twenty bottles of soda water are still exploding from the cold every day. It seems that all the soda water is about to deteriorate and become useless. How did this soda water come about, and why is it suffering such losses? Last July, soda water was selling well in Princess Ling, so the leading cadres of the Native Products Company sent people to Shanhaiguan to buy soda water. They bought back over 12,000 bottles, but by then the weather had already turned cold. The Native Products Company refused to lower the price to sell it, so this batch of soda water was hoarded.

　　Similar things have happened more than once at the Princess Ling Native Products Company. In the past two years, due to the company's blind procurement, waiting for high prices, and hoarding of goods, losses have reached 2,001.6 million yuan.

　　Let me tell you another story about apples and chickens.

　　In 1951, the company originally planned to purchase 90,000 jin of apples, but the purchasing agent went to Wafangdian and bought 170,000 jin. The company only had cellars to store 90,000 jin of apples, so the extra 80,000 jin of apples had to be piled up randomly. The company leaders did not actively try to sell them and continued to sell them at the normal price of 2,800 yuan per jin (the cost was 1,250 yuan to 1,600 yuan per jin). Until April 1952, many apples had already rotted. The company had no choice but to sell the remaining 50,000 jin of apples for 500 yuan per jin. The company lost 78 million yuan from this alone.

　　The company also bought chickens in October 1951. Again, the leading cadres saw that chickens could make money, so they ordered the Huai De Cheng Native Products Store to buy over 10,000 of them. After they were transported to the company, there was no place to feed them, and they could not be sold immediately, so they were placed in an empty room. As a result, some were squeezed to death, some were crushed to death, and some died on the road or from illness, for a total loss of more than 5,000. After seeing this approach by the company's leading cadres, Liu Chengtai, a worker at the company, said: "Our company really doesn't know how to do business. They always want to make a big profit, but in the end they can't sell them, and they are either thrown away or rotted. Even the capital is lost."

    汽水烤火的故事
    王山风
    在这严寒的冬天，吉林省公主岭土产公司还积压着一万多瓶汽水。为了不让这些汽水冻坏，特别生起火炉烤着它们。但这些汽水每天至少还要冻炸二十多瓶。全部汽水眼看就要变质而失去效用。这些汽水是怎样来的，为什么又会遭受到这样的损失呢？去年七月，公主岭的汽水畅销，土产公司的领导干部就派人到山海关去买汽水。买回一万二千多瓶汽水，天气已经凉了。但土产公司不肯减价出卖，就这样把这批汽水积压下来。
    类似的事在公主岭土产公司并不只一件。两年来，由于该公司盲目采购、坐等高价、积压商品的结果，光损耗就达二十亿零一百六十万元。
    这里再讲讲苹果和小鸡的故事。
    一九五一年，该公司原计划采购九万斤苹果，但采购员却到瓦房店买回十七万斤。公司只有藏九万斤苹果的地窖，多买的八万斤苹果只好乱堆乱放，公司领导方面并不积极设法推销，继续按每斤二千八百元照常出售（成本每斤一千二百五十元至一千六百元）。直到一九五二年四月，苹果已烂了许多。公司迫不得已，将剩下的五万多斤苹果按每斤五百元出售。光这一次公司就损失了七千八百万元。
    该公司一九五一年十月还买过一回小鸡，那次也是领导干部看见小鸡能赚钱，就叫怀德城土产商店买了一万多只。运到公司后，没有地方喂养，一下又卖不掉，就放在一个空屋子里。结果挤死的挤死，压死的压死，加上路上压死、病死的，一共损失了五千多只。该公司的工友刘成太看到公司领导干部的这种作法后说：咱们公司真不会作买卖，老想狠狠地赚一把钱，结果卖不了，扔的扔，烂的烂，老本也赔了。
