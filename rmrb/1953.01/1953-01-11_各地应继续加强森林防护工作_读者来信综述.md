    Localities Should Continue to Strengthen Forest Protection Work
    ——Reader Letters Summary
    Recently, many regions have again experienced incidents of damaging mountain forests. According to reader Xiong Youwei and others, in Hunan's Yongming County, Liu Fuxi, a farmer from Liujia Yuan Township, caused a mountain fire on December 12th last year by burning weeds on his field ridges. As a result, 5,000 mu of mountain land were burned, and seven or eight hundred wild tangerine trees were destroyed. At the same time, this county has experienced seven mountain fire incidents in the past ten days. Reader Zhan Zaiming wrote that although the forest protection work in the Eighth District of Luoshan County, Henan Province, has been successful, the destruction of forests has not been eradicated. Recently, illegal logging has occurred in Xiazai Township of this district. Furthermore, readers Liu Tongchun, Wang Hongyuan, and He Hongchang wrote that the Zhoukoudian mining area in the western suburbs of Beijing is experiencing indiscriminate logging in Fangshan and other places due to private coal kilns such as the Dongsheng Coal Kiln rushing to purchase pit props and raising purchase prices (for example, the local trust company's purchase price is 18,000 yuan per 100 jin, while the coal kilns offer 33,000 yuan).
    The people's governments of the aforementioned regions should, based on the specific circumstances, promptly stop this behavior of damaging mountain forests, and establish and improve local forest protection organizations, explaining to the masses the importance of maintaining mountain forests for the development of agricultural production, so that the masses can automatically and regularly prevent the occurrence of mountain forest destruction incidents.

    各地应继续加强森林防护工作
    ——读者来信综述
    近来许多地区又连续发生了破坏山林的事件。据读者熊有为等来信反映：湖南永明县刘家沅乡农民刘佛西在去年十二月十二日因烧田塍的杂草而引起山火，结果烧山五千亩，烧毁了野柑子树七、八百株。同时这个县在最近十天内，曾连续发生烧山事件七起。读者占再明来信说：河南罗山县八区的护林工作虽有成绩，但破坏森林的事情却还没有绝迹。这个区的夏寨乡近来又发生乱伐林木的事情。又据读者刘同春、王鸿元、何宏昌来信反映：北京西郊周口店矿区，因私营东升煤窑等抢购坑木，高抬收价（如当地信托公司收价每百斤一万八千元，煤窑则出价三万三千元），引起房山等地发生滥伐林木的现象。
    上述地区的人民政府，应根据具体情况，对这种破坏山林的行为，及时加以制止，并建立和健全当地的护林组织，向群众说明保持山林对发展农业生产的重要意义，使群众能够自动地经常防止破坏山林事件的发生。
