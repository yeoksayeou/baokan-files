    Several Questions Regarding People's Grants (Part Two)
    Question: Are there differences in the standards for People's Grants in different regions?
    Answer: The grant standards set by the central Ministry of Education are budget standards. In specific implementation, various regions must make appropriate adjustments based on local price levels, within the overall budget. Because prices and living standards vary from region to region, and because more children of poor peasants in the early liberated areas are enrolled in schools, it is justifiable to have differences in standards for the same level and type of schools in different regions.
    Question: Is it reasonable for some students in schools that have changed from a supply system to a People's Grant system to still enjoy medium and small灶 (zao: literally "stove", refers to special meals or treatment)待遇 (daiyu: treatment)? Is it reasonable for nursery and nanny fees for female students' children to be paid from the total amount of People's Grants?
    Answer: Schools that have changed from a supply system to a grant system are generally worker-peasant secondary schools and worker-peasant elementary schools. The students in these schools are transferred from work positions to study and have a certain number of years of revolutionary experience or work experience. Therefore, their treatment should be based on their family's financial situation and with reference to their original positions, give allowances and subsidies. A small number of supply system cadres who enjoy medium and small 灶 are mostly cadres who have served the revolution for a long time. In order to ensure their health, it is also necessary and reasonable not to reduce their living standards after entering school. As for the nursery and nanny fees for female students' children, if they are children before enrollment, it is stipulated that their spouses' employers should apply for solutions. For maternity and nursery/nanny fees for children born after enrollment, the central Ministry of Education has already budgeted for these expenses when formulating the grant standards for worker-peasant secondary schools. Therefore, these fees should be adjusted and resolved from the total amount of grants.
    Question: What should be done if it is difficult to implement the newly set People's Grant standards in ordinary middle schools in old liberated areas?
    Answer: The central Ministry of Education has stipulated that the People's Grant standards for ordinary middle schools in old areas should be appropriately increased. The specific methods and the number of recipients will be proposed by each region based on specific circumstances and submitted to the central Ministry of Education for approval and implementation.
    Question: How are grants stipulated for cadres who are transferred to schools?
    Answer: In 1952, in order to solve the problem of insufficient enrollment in universities and colleges, and also to improve the cultural and political level of cadres and cultivate backbones for national construction, various agencies and organizations transferred a large number of cadres to take entrance examinations for universities and colleges. The grants for these students were calculated at an average of 320,000 yuan per person per month, which was managed uniformly by the school to solve their food, clothing, and learning supplies expenses at a unified standard. In addition, appropriate subsidies were given based on the students' original positions and family financial situation to appropriately solve their personal and family difficulties. This stipulation is mainly because these students are mostly middle-aged cadres recommended by their units, have family burdens, and are different from ordinary young students. It is necessary to appropriately solve their family difficulties in order to better ensure their learning tasks and health.

    关于人民助学金的几个问题（二）
    问：不同地区的学校，人民助学金标准是否有差别？
    答：中央教育部规定的助学金标准是预算标准，各地区在具体执行时，结合当地物价情况，在不超过总的预算范围内加以适当调整是必须的。因为各地区物价和生活程度不同，而在早解放地区贫苦农民子女入学的较多，故在不同地区虽是同级同类学校标准有差别也还是正当的。
    问：由供给制改为人民助学金制的学校中，部分同学仍享受中、小灶待遇是否合理？女同学孩子所需保育费、褓姆费由人民助学金总数中支付是否合理？
    答：由供给制改为助学金制的学校，一般系工农速成中学、工农速成初等学校。这些学校的学员都是从工作岗位上调到学校学习的，具有一定年限的革命经历或工龄，所以对他们的待遇问题，应根据其家庭经济情况参考原任职务发给津贴及补助费。少数享受中、小灶待遇的供给制干部，多系较长时期为革命服务的干部，为保证他们身体健康，入学后不降低他们的生活水平也是必要的、合理的。女同学的保育、褓姆费，如为其入学前的子女，规定由其爱人的任职机关申请解决，入学后生育子女的生育费及保育、褓姆费，中央教育部在拟订工农速成中学助学金标准时，已预算进去包括有此项费用，因此应由助学金总数内调剂解决。
    问：老解放区普通中学按照新定人民助学金标准实行有困难时，如何解决？
    答：老区普通中学人民助学金标准，中央教育部已规定酌情提高，其具体办法及享受名额由各地区根据具体情况提出意见，报中央教育部批准实行。
    问：抽调的干部入学后的助学金如何规定？
    答：一九五二年为了解决高等学校招生来源不足，也为了提高干部的文化政治水平，培养国家建设的骨干，曾由各机关团体抽调大批干部投考入高等学校，这些同学的助学金每人每月按平均三十二万元为标准计算，由学校统一掌握，以统一标准解决其伙食、服装、学习用品等费用，并比照学生原任职务及家庭经济情况，适当的给予不同补助，适当解决其本人及家庭困难。这样规定，主要是因为这些学员多系经机关保送入学的中年干部，都有家庭负担，与一般青年学生不同，必须适当解决其家庭困难，这样才能更好的保证他们的学习任务与身体健康。
