    Central People's Government Ministry of Geology Geological Exploration Team
    Discovers Huge New Iron Mine in North China
    Rich New Coalfield Discovered in Weinan Area, Shaanxi
    A huge new iron mine in North China has been confirmed by the No. 241 Geological Exploration Team of the Central People's Government Ministry of Geology after nearly three years of arduous field exploration. This new iron mine has a concentrated mining area, good ore quality, abundant reserves, and the ore is up to several hundred meters thick in the thickest places. Moreover, it is buried not very deep, and large-scale open-pit mining can be carried out using modern methods in some areas. The discovery of this new iron mine is of great significance to the development of China's steel industry.
    The No. 241 Geological Exploration Team arrived in this sparsely populated grassland area in May 1950. After their arrival, they began work without housing, water, or even sufficient manual tools. All team members overcame difficulties in their work with unparalleled perseverance. When there were no houses to live in, they set up yurts. When there was no water to drink, they dug up ancient wells that had been dry for decades. The temperature in this mining area began to drop to zero degrees Celsius in September, and reached minus thirty-five to forty degrees Celsius at its coldest. In order to continue working, they built yurts over the water wells, with stoves inside the yurts, and covered the wells with thick horse manure to prevent the well water from freezing. The drilling rigs were also protected by yurts so that drilling work could continue in the cold climate. Surveyors often persisted in geological surveying and topographic measurement in the field despite the cold weather. Thanks to the hard work of all team members, relatively rich materials have been obtained regarding the topography and geology of this mining area. According to existing materials, the estimated reserves of this mining area have expanded more than tenfold compared to the initial estimates.
    In the past three years, the people's government and the people around the mining area have provided great assistance to the work of the No. 241 Geological Exploration Team. In 1950, when bandits around the mining area had not yet been eliminated, the local people's government specially sent armed personnel to protect them. The local people also often provided them with fat cattle and sheep for food. Every year during the Spring Festival and other holidays, the people's government and the masses near the mining area would bring gifts and travel dozens of miles to celebrate with them.
    At present, there are small machine repair shops, warehouses, dining halls, dormitories, auditoriums, bathhouses and other buildings in this mining area, and there is a highway leading to the nearby railway line. With the start of China's large-scale economic construction, the geological exploration of this mining area will also be carried out on a larger scale starting this year; the scale of work in this mining area this year, in drilling alone, will be ten times larger than last year.
    The discovery of a new coalfield with rich reserves in the Weinan area of Shaanxi Province will be of great value for solving the problem of coal for industry and transportation in the Northwest. In 1951, the central geological department sent a geological exploration team to the Weinan area to begin exploration. After nearly two years of hard work, the exploration team surveyed more than 800 kilometers of routes and discovered two new coalfields, both with rich reserves; one of them is close to the railway line, making transportation convenient. The Weinan Coalfield Geological Exploration Team also conducted trial drilling in the vast area between these two coalfields. Judging from the shale obtained from the trial drilling, it is possible to discover even larger coalfields. The team has now switched to 500-meter drilling rigs for deep drilling. This year, the team has a larger task, and the number of drilling rigs used will be ten times more than in the past. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府地质部地质勘探队
    在华北地区发现一个巨大的新铁矿
    陕西渭北地区发现埋藏量丰富的新煤田
    华北地区一个巨大的新铁矿，已为中央人民政府地质部二四一地质勘探队经过近三年来野外艰苦勘探后而加以肯定。这个新铁矿矿区集中，矿质良好，矿藏丰富，矿石最厚处达数百公尺，并且埋藏不深，局部可以用现代化方法进行大规模的露天开采。这个新铁矿的发现对于我国钢铁工业的发展具有重大意义。
    二四一地质勘探队是在一九五○年五月到达这个地旷人稀的草原地带的。他们到达以后，就在无房、无水和人力工具都感缺乏的情况下开始了工作。全队人员以无比的毅力克服工作中的困难。没有房子住，他们就搭起蒙古包。没有水吃，他们就动手挖开已经枯竭几十年的古井。这个矿区自九月开始气温就降到零度，最冷时达到零下三十五度到四十度。为了坚持工作，他们在水井上搭起蒙古包，蒙古包里生着火炉，又在水井四周盖上很厚的马粪，以防止井水结冰。钻探机也用蒙古包保护起来，以便在寒冷的气候下继续进行钻探工作。测量人员不顾气候寒冷，仍经常坚持在野外进行地质的测绘和地形的测量。由于全队人员的辛勤努力，关于这个矿区的地形、地质方面已获得较为丰富的材料。根据现有材料估计，这个矿区的蕴藏量已较最初估计扩大达十倍以上。
    三年来该矿区附近的人民政府和人民群众，对二四一地质勘探队的工作作了很大的帮助。在一九五○年矿区周围土匪尚未肃清时，当地人民政府专门派了武装人员来保护他们。当地人民群众也经常以肥壮的牛、羊供给他们食用。每逢过年过节，矿区附近的人民政府和群众就携带着礼物，从数十里外赶去和他们联欢。
    目前，这个矿区里已有小型的机器修配厂、仓库、饭厅、宿舍、礼堂、浴室等建筑物，并有一条公路通到附近的铁路线。随着我国大规模经济建设开始，这个矿区的地质勘探工作，也从今年起更大规模的进行；今年这个矿区的工作规模，只钻探一项，就较去年扩大十倍。
    陕西渭北地区发现埋藏量丰富的新煤田，这个煤田的开发，对于解决西北工业、交通用煤问题将有重大价值。一九五一年，中央地质部门派出地质勘探队到渭北地区开始勘探。经过近两年来的辛勤工作，勘探队调查了八百多公里的路线，已经发现两个新煤田，埋藏量都很丰富；其中一个靠近铁路线，交通方便。渭北煤田地质勘探队又在这两个煤田之间的广大地区内进行试钻，从试钻所获得的页岩看来，可能发现更大的煤田。现该队已改换五百公尺钻机进行深钻。今年该队的任务更大，所用钻探机将比过去增加十倍。（新华社）
