The tasks set forth by the 19th National Congress of the Party in the directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union place enormous demands on all our cadres, especially leading economic cadres.

The Communist Party has cultivated numerous outstanding leading economic cadres who possess boundless loyalty to the Soviet motherland, are adept at implementing the Party's policies, and are thoroughly familiar with the work entrusted to them. The Party constantly cares for the ideological and professional growth of our economic cadres, ensuring that their entire activities are imbued with the spirit of Party spirit.

Comrade Stalin instructed that economic work is the work of the Party. Every economic worker who builds and promotes the cause is a true Party worker who should receive the Party's full support.

To manifest Party spirit in economic work means to proceed from the interests of the Party and the state at all times and in all places, to resolutely implement the instructions of the Party and the government, and to strictly abide by Party and state discipline.

Most of our economic workers are active fighters in implementing the Party's resolutions. However, among economic workers, there are still those who treat the resolutions of the Party and the government in a perfunctory manner, lack persistence in the struggle to implement these resolutions, and are not disturbed by the poor performance of their work and the losses suffered by the state's interests. At the recent plenary session of the Krasnoyarsk City Committee, the participants justly criticized Comrades Sitnikov and Liangdeles, the leaders of two construction trusts, for their passive attitude towards implementing the resolutions of the Party and the government when discussing the progress of residential and cultural construction. Due to their formalism and passivity, the trusts they led consistently violated construction plans.

For an economic worker who is a Communist Party member, to manifest Party spirit in work means to treat the state with a sincere and honest attitude at all times and in all matters, large and small. Party organizations should constantly educate our workers to possess this quality. Those who attempt to deceive the government, cheat the Party and the state, are not worthy of trust.

Unfortunately, people who are perfunctory and deceitful, who like to add production figures in production reports, and who violate state discipline in other ways, have not disappeared. In his report to the 19th National Congress of the Party, Comrade Malenkov stated that one of the most dangerous and egregious violations of Party discipline and state law is that some staff members conceal the true situation of the enterprises and institutions under their jurisdiction and exaggerate their work achievements.

These situations also exist in our Krasnoyarsk Territory. Some leaders, under the pretext of taking care of the enterprises under their jurisdiction, conceal materials from the state, place the narrow interests of their departments above the interests of the country, and fabricate production figures. For example, Leshejin, the director of the Krasnoyarsk Woodworking United Manufacturing Factory, and the director of the prefabricated housing construction materials manufacturing workshop consistently jointly fabricated products, increased the quantity of prefabricated housing construction materials produced, created the appearance of successfully completing the plan, and even received bonuses for this. The perpetrators of this violation of state interests have been severely punished.

It is not uncommon for individual economic leaders to overproduce secondary products beyond the plan by failing to complete the production tasks of the most important products stipulated in the state plan. Gairifangde, the chairman of the presidium of the Krasnoyarsk Territory Forest Chemical Industry United Bureau, has done such things. On the surface, everything is fine with the Territory Forest Chemical Industry United Bureau. The total product volume of the enterprise for nine months completed 100.5 percent of the plan. However, at the same time, the tasks of producing the most important products—furniture, harnesses, millwork, etc.—were only completed 35 to 75 percent in total.

Producing products of poor quality is a serious violation of state law. In some of our enterprises, there are still phenomena of producing inferior products and goods.

Analysis of these facts proves that these violations of state interests often occur where the Party organization's supervision of the economic activities of the enterprise is weak, where the Party organization does not deeply study the economic problems in production, and where it does not educate Party members in the spirit of strictly observing Party discipline and state law. The Woodworking United Manufacturing Factory fabricated achievements in production reports precisely because the Party organization's supervision was weak.

In implementing the resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the Territorial Committee strives to ensure that Party organizations constantly educate cadres in the spirit of strictly observing Party and state discipline and steadfastly safeguarding state interests. Party organizations should do their best to support honest workers who are loyal to the Party and the state, and at the same time, they should expose and punish those who are perfunctory and deceitful.

To manifest Party spirit in economic work means to be able to fulfill the Party's requirements at all times. Soviet economic workers are innovators of production, revolutionaries in technology, and passionate fighters for technological progress. Their responsibility is to continuously improve production methods, constantly explore, discover, and utilize hidden potential, as well as new methods to improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and improve product quality, and actively support and adopt all new and advanced things. They should be shrewd masters, saving every penny of the state. The economy system is their socialist management method.

Not all enterprise leaders in the Territory are engaged in the struggle to utilize potential. There are often phenomena of poor management and waste, and unrestrained expenditure of materials, human resources, and financial resources. The task of Party organizations and economic workers, as required by the 19th National Congress of the Party, is to ensure the rapid elimination of the causes that hinder the improvement of labor productivity, eliminate the shortcomings in the use of technology, and systematically improve the forms and methods of labor organization and production organization.

The Party and the Soviet state not only entrust our economic workers with important responsibilities but also grant them great rights. The factory director in an enterprise is solely responsible, is a leader with full authority, and is fully responsible for the state of the enterprise and the order in production. If there is no one-man responsibility system and no order in the enterprise, there will be no basic conditions for normal work. Therefore, every Party organization should be responsible for consolidating the one-man responsibility system and the prestige of economic workers.

At the same time, an economic leader should rely on the Party organization in the enterprise in all his work. Economic workers should personally pay attention to strengthening political education work. The better the political education of workers, engineers, technicians, and staff is arranged, the higher their labor enthusiasm will be, the more acute their reactions to the shortcomings in the work of individuals, groups, workshops, or the entire enterprise, and the smoother the struggle against the shortcomings will be. Only those who are bureaucratic and have lost their Party spirit in their work will work in isolation from the Party organization, from activists, and will despise the decisive significance of people's political education.

Although there are fewer such bureaucrats in our Territory, they can still be encountered. Among economic workers, people who do not correctly understand the principle of one-man responsibility can often be encountered. They mistakenly believe that since they have been given the rights of one-man responsibility, they can command the enterprise without supervision and can despise the suggestions of the Party organization or production activists.

There was a factory director of an enterprise who regarded administrative orders and lengthy, unproductive meetings as the main tasks of leadership, where empty slogans often replaced the practical solution of problems. This creates the danger of the factory director becoming detached from the entire staff of the factory, from the activists; he loses the support of the activists in discovering and eliminating the shortcomings in the work. The Communist Party members in the factory themselves corrected this situation. They sharply criticized the director's incorrect leadership methods and criticized the errors of commandism and futile meetings.

Economic workers can only become detached from the Party organization and from the activists in places where Party work and the ideological education of economic cadres are weak, in places where the Party organization does not exercise its right to supervise administrative work, and in places where an atmosphere of self-satisfaction, pride, and mutual boasting replaces self-criticism, especially criticism from below. The responsibility of Party organizations is to educate economic cadres in the spirit of Party spirit, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

Party spirit in the work of economic workers is, first of all, to have close ties with the masses, to treat one's own work achievements with a critical attitude, to be good at seeing shortcomings, to correctly analyze them, and to rely on all employees in the struggle against the shortcomings. Being sensitive and attentive to criticism from below, and treating criticism correctly and with a Party attitude, are indispensable qualities of Soviet economic workers.

One of the most important principles of Party spirit in the work of economic leaders is to constantly care about meeting the living needs of workers and staff. He has no right to forget that all achievements and victories are guaranteed by people, by cadres.

The Party and the government are constantly concerned about meeting the material and cultural needs of the workers. The government allocates a large amount of funds every year for the construction of housing and cultural facilities for every enterprise leader to dispose of.

A caring economic worker will fully utilize these funds, overfulfill the housing construction plan, promptly repair workers' dormitories, and care about the work of canteens, bathhouses, clinics, and kindergartens.

However, among economic workers, there are often those who are accustomed to making excuses for difficulties in work and objective reasons, violating the implementation of the housing construction plan, and not caring about the needs of the employees of the enterprise.

Our Party organization supports the beneficial suggestions of economic leaders who care about the needs of the workers and launches sharp criticism against those leaders who are indifferent to this cause. Party organizations and economic leaders should regard the elimination of shortcomings in the living supply of workers as their direct responsibility.

One of the reasons why some economic workers develop incorrect methods in their work is that their Marxist-Leninist cultivation is insufficient. An economic leader who wishes to successfully complete the work entrusted to him should consistently and persistently study and master Marxism-Leninism. Indifference to theory can cause a staff member to degenerate into a bureaucrat who only seeks immediate interests.

Party organizations must help economic cadres more in their political studies, and at the same time, they must be more strict with them. At present, special attention should be paid to studying the resolutions and documents of the 19th National Congress of the Party and Comrade Stalin's work: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

Our cadres, armed with the historic resolutions of the Congress and Comrade Stalin's brilliant work, are the decisive force in the leadership of the Party and the state, guaranteeing the successful completion of the tasks set forth by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    关于经济工作中的党性
    苏联共产党克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区委员会书记  奥尔加诺夫
    党的第十九次代表大会在关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示中所提出的任务，对我们全体干部、特别是经济领导干部，提出巨大的要求。
    共产党教育出许许多多卓越的经济领导干部，他们对苏维埃祖国有着无限的忠诚，善于实现党的政策，十二分地熟习所被委托的事业。党经常关怀着我们的经济干部在思想和业务方面的成长，关怀他们要在全部活动中都贯穿着党性的精神。
    斯大林同志指示说，经济工作是党的工作。每一个经济工作者，如果他建设并推动事业前进的话，他便是一个应该得到党的充分支持的真正的党的工作者。
    要在经济工作中表现党性，这就是说随时随地都要从党的利益、从国家的利益出发，坚持执行党和政府的指令，严格遵守党的和国家的纪律。
    我们的经济工作者，大多数都是实行党的决议的积极战士。然而在经济工作者之间还可以遇到这样的人，他们形式地对待党和政府的决议，在为执行这些决议而进行的斗争中缺乏坚持性，不为他们的工作进行得不好和使国家利益遭受损失而不安。在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克市委会最近一次的全会上，当讨论住宅建筑和文化生活建筑的进程时，全会参加者公正地批评了两个建筑托辣斯的领导者西特尼科夫同志和梁得列斯同志对执行党和政府的决议时的消极态度。由于他们的形式主义和消极态度，他们所领导的托辣斯一贯破坏着建筑计划。
    作为一个共产党员的经济工作者，在工作中要表现党性，就是指随时随地、在大小事情上都要以真挚而诚实的态度对待国家而言。党组织应当时时教育我们的工作者要具有这种品质。那企图向政府耍诡计，欺骗党和国家的人，是不配获得信任的。
    可惜，敷衍欺瞒的人，爱好在生产报告书中增添生产数字的人和其他破坏国家纪律的人还没有消失。马林科夫同志在党的第十九次代表大会的报告中说到，一种最危险最恶劣的违犯党纪和国法的行为，是某些工作人员隐瞒他们所管辖的企业和机关的真实情况，夸饰工作成绩。
    这些情况在我们的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区也有。一些领导者以照顾他所管辖的企业为借口，对国家隐瞒物资，把本部门的狭隘利益放在全国利益之上，并虚报生产数量。例如，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克木工联合制造厂厂长列舍金和活动房屋建筑材料制造车间主任一贯共同虚报产品，提高所生产的活动房屋建筑材料的数量，制造顺利完成计划的外表，并且还因此而得到了奖金。这种违反国家利益的肇事人已受到了严格处分。
    个别的经济领导者用不完成国家计划所规定的最重要的产品生产任务的办法，来超计划地生产次要产品，这种违反国家利益的情况，还是不稀少的。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区森林化学工业联合局主席团主席盖里方德就做过这样的事。边疆区森林化学工业联合局表面上一切都很好。该企业九个月的产品总量完成了计划的百分之一百点五。但同时，生产最重要的制品——家具、马具、细木制品等——的任务，总共只完成了百分之三十五至七十五。
    生产质量不好的产品，是严重的破坏国家法纪的行为。在我们的一些企业中还有生产质量低劣的制品和商品的现象。
    分析这些事实，证明这种违反国家利益的情况，时常发生在党组织对企业的经济活动监督软弱的地方，发生在党组织不深刻研究生产中的经济问题和以极严格地遵守党纪和国法的精神教育党员不好的地方。木工联合制造厂正是因为党组织的监督薄弱，才发生了在生产报告书中虚报成绩的事情。
    边疆区委会在实现党的第十九次代表大会的决议时，力求达到党组织要经常以最严格地遵守党和国家纪律和始终不渝地卫护国家利益的精神来教育干部。党组织要尽力支持诚实的、忠实于党和国家的工作人员，同时应当揭发和处分敷衍和欺瞒的人。
    要在经济工作中表现党性，就是说时时都能完成党的要求。苏联的经济工作者是生产革新者，是技术上的革命者，是争取技术进步的热情战士。他的责任是不断改善生产方法，经常探讨、发现和利用隐藏着的潜力以及提高劳动生产率、降低成本、提高产品质量的新方法，积极支持和采用一切新的、先进的事物。他应当是一个精打细算的主人，节省国家的每一分钱。节约制度，是他的社会主义的经营方法。
    不是边疆区的全部企业领导者都进行着争取利用潜力的斗争。还时常遇到经营不善和浪费、支出材料和人力财力的毫无节制现象。党组织和经济工作者的任务，正如党的第十九次代表大会所要求的，就是要保证很快地铲除阻碍劳动生产率提高的原因，铲除利用技术方面的缺点，有步骤地改善劳动组织和生产组织的形式和方法。
    党和苏维埃国家，不仅使我们的经济工作者担负有重大责任，同时也赋予了他们很大的权利。企业中的厂长是单一负责制，是具有全权的领导者，他对企业的状况和生产中的秩序完全负责。企业中如果没有单一负责制，没有秩序，也就不会有正常工作的基本条件。所以每个党组织都应该负责巩固单一负责制和经济工作者的威信。
    同时，一个经济领导者在他的全部工作中，都应该依靠企业中的党组织。经济工作者要亲自注意加强政治教育工作。工人、工程师、技术工作者和职员的政治教育安排得愈好，他们的劳动积极性便愈高，他们对个别人、小组、车间或整个企业工作中的缺点的反应就愈尖锐，对缺点的斗争也就愈顺利。只有事务主义者和在工作中失掉了党性的人，才会脱离党组织、脱离积极分子而工作，才会轻视人们的政治教育的决定性意义。
    这种事务主义者在我们边疆区虽较少，但是总还是可以遇到。在经济工作者之间，时常可以遇到对单一负责制的原则了解不正确的人。他们错误地认为，既然给了他们单一负责制的权利，那么他便可以不受监督地命令企业，并可以轻视党组织或生产积极分子的建议。
    有一个企业的厂长，他把行政命令、冗长的无结果的会议看做是领导的主要任务，在这些会议上时常是空喊代替了实际解决问题。这就产生了厂长脱离工厂全体人员、脱离积极分子的危险；他在发现和铲除工作中的缺点时失掉积极分子的支持。工厂中的共产党员们自己改正了这种情况。他们对于厂长这种不正确的领导方法提出了尖锐的批评，批判了命令主义和徒劳无益的会议的错误。
    经济工作者脱离党组织、脱离积极分子，只能发生在党的工作、经济干部的思想教育薄弱的地方，只能发生在党组织未运用监督行政工作的权利的地方，只能发生在自安自慰、骄傲自满和互相标榜的空气代替了自我批评、特别是来自下面的批评的地方。党组织的责任，便是以党性的精神、以批评和自我批评的精神来教育经济干部。
    经济工作者工作中的党性，首先是要与群众有密切联系，以批评的态度对待自己的工作成绩，善于看到缺点，正确地分析它们，在与缺点的斗争中依靠全体职工。敏感的、注意地对待来自下面的批评，正确的、以党的态度对待批评，是苏联经济工作者的不可缺少的品质。
    经济领导者工作中，党性的一个最重要的原则，便是经常关怀满足工人和职员的生活需要。他没有权利忘记，各种成就和胜利都是由人、由干部来保证的。
    党和政府是经常关怀着满足劳动者的物质和文化需要的。政府每年都拨有建筑住宅和文化生活机关的大量资金供每一个企业首长来支配。
    一个关心的经济工作者便完全利用这些资金，超额完成住宅建筑计划，及时修葺工人宿舍，关怀饭厅、浴室、医务所和幼儿园的工作。
    但是，在经济工作者中时常遇到这样的人，他们习惯于借口工作中的困难和客观原因，破坏住宅建筑计划的执行和不关心企业的职工的需要。
    我们的党组织支持那些关怀劳动者需要的经济领导者的有益的建议，并对那些对这一事业漠不关心的领导者展开尖锐的批评。党组织和经济领导者应该把铲除对劳动者的生活供应中的缺点，看做是自己的直接责任。
    一些经济工作者在工作中产生不正确的方法的原因之一，是他们的马克思列宁主义的修养不够。一个经济领导者，如果他愿意成功地完成委托给他的事业，他应该一贯坚持地学习，掌握马克思列宁主义。对理论的漠不关心，会使一个工作人员堕落成为只图眼前利益的事务主义者。
    党组织必须更要多帮助经济干部的政治学习，同时对他们要更加严格。目前应该特殊注意研究党的第十九次代表大会的决议和文件，斯大林同志的著作：“苏联社会主义经济问题”。
    我们为代表大会的历史性决议和斯大林同志的天才著作所武装的干部，是党和国家领导的决定性力量，保证着成功地完成苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所提出的任务。（君强译自一九五三年一月四日苏联“真理报”）
