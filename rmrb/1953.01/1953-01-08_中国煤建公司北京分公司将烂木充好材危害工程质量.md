China Coal Construction Company Beijing Branch Uses Rotten Wood as Good Material, Endangering Project Quality

Editor: To ensure the quality of basic construction projects and smoothly complete the great economic construction tasks of the motherland, it is crucial to provide timber that meets specifications and quality requirements. However, the Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has made a significant mistake in this regard. They sell inferior timber as good material, seriously affecting project quality and progress.

In 1952, the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company purchased over 5,000 cubic meters of first, second, and third-grade timber from the Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company. A portion of this timber turned out to be ungraded and fourth-grade material, most of which was already rotten. The average yield of processed timber was only about 60%, and only about 40% could actually be used in the project. Some thick wood shattered when sawn; some rotten wood was like a "telescope," with light shining through both ends, and in some cases, a person could even crawl inside. Due to the decay of the timber, it has affected the progress of the project and aroused dissatisfaction among workers at the construction site. Workers at the No. 19 construction site wrote to the construction company, questioning: "Fifty percent of the timber delivered to the construction site is rotten. Makeshift use will inevitably endanger project quality; if we don't use it at all, it will hinder the progress of the project." The workers' opinions are completely correct.

The North China Basic Construction Engineering Company has reflected the above situation to the company in official letters and has also raised the issue face-to-face several times, hoping to draw their attention. However, they ignored it. Recently, Yang Baoxing, a purchasing agent from the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company, discovered when inspecting the company's planks at Tiejianying outside Yongdingmen that they were counting 0.018 planks as 0.02 planks. When he negotiated with them, a section chief named Wu in their company actually said, "That's just how it is, you can just not take it if you don't want it."

In 1953, the motherland's large-scale economic construction began, and basic construction projects in the capital urgently require a large amount of timber. If the Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company continues to sell rotten timber as it did last year, it will more seriously lead to poor project quality and directly harm the motherland's basic construction. It is hoped that the company, in the spirit of being responsible for the people's property, will seriously and thoroughly examine its shortcomings and actively improve its work to avoid similar situations from happening again. Liu Shifu

Editor's note: The problem reflected by reader Liu Shifu is very important. At present, basic construction is the primary task of the motherland, and timber is an important part of building materials. Whether timber can be supplied in a timely and sufficient manner is related to the entire project progress; the quality of timber directly affects the quality of the project. The Beijing Branch of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company's behavior of selling inferior timber as good timber is absolutely unacceptable. In order to do a good job in the motherland's basic construction, we hope that the broad masses of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and trade department staff will promptly inform us of such bad behaviors that endanger basic construction and waste national wealth, and assist the government in inspecting and supervising this work.

### 中国煤建公司北京分公司将烂木充好材危害工程质量

    中国煤建公司北京分公司将烂木充好材危害工程质量
    编辑同志：为了保证基本建设工程的质量，顺利地完成祖国伟大的经济建设任务，充分供应合乎规格和质量要求的木材，是十分重要的问题。但中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司在这一点上却犯了很大的错误，他们将劣等木材充作好材出售，以致严重地影响了工程质量和进度。
    华北基本建设工程公司一九五二年度向中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司购入五千余立方公尺的一、二、三等木材中，其中一部分竟是等外材和四等材，大部已经腐烂了。加工制出成材率平均仅百分之六十左右，而实际能使用在工程上的仅占百分之四十。有的厚木上了锯就碎不成材；有的腐朽木材是“望远镜”式的，两端透光，甚至有的能钻进一个人去。由于木材腐朽，已影响工程的进度和引起建筑工地工人的不满。一九工地的工人曾写信给建筑公司提出责问：“运到工地来的木材有百分之五十是腐朽的。凑合对付势必危害工程质量；根本不用它，则将妨碍工程的进度。”工人的意见是完全正确的。
    华北基本建设工程公司为此曾经用公函将上述情况反映给该公司，并且当面也数次提过意见，以期引起他们的重视。但他们竟置之不理。最近，华北基本建设工程公司采购员杨宝兴在永定门外铁匠营点收该公司板材时，发现他们将点零一八板材算成为点零二的板材，当时即向他们交涉，他们公司里的一位吴股长居然说：“反正是这样，你们不要就算了。”
    一九五三年祖国的大规模经济建设开始了，首都各处基本建设工程迫切需要大批木材。如果中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司仍像去年那样出售腐朽木材，则必将更严重地引起工程质量的低劣，直接损害了祖国的基本建设。希望该公司本着对人民财产负责的精神，严肃、深入地检查自己的缺点，积极主动地改进工作，以免类似情形再度发生。  刘仕夫
    编者按：读者刘仕夫反映的这个问题很重要。当前基本建设是祖国的首要任务，而木材是建筑器材中重要的一部分。木材能否及时和充足地供应，关系着整个工程进度；木材质量的好坏，又直接影响着工程质量。中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司这种以劣等木材充好木材出售的行为，是绝对不能容许的。为了搞好祖国的基本建设，我们希望广大的工人、工程技术人员、贸易部门工作人员，及时地将此类危害基本建设、浪费国家财富的不良行为告诉我们，协助政府来检查、监督这一工作。
