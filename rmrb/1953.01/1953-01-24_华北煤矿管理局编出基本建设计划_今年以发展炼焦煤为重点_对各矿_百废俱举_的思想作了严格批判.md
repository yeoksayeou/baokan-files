Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd:

    To guarantee the needs of the nation's steel industry development, the North China Coal Mining Administration criticized the "undertake everything at once" mentality among the leading cadres of its subordinate mining bureaus, and compiled a 1953 basic construction plan focusing on developing coking coal.

    In compiling the 1953 basic construction plan, the North China Coal Mining Administration resolutely implemented the central government's "focus on key construction" policy and strictly criticized local perspectives and egalitarianism. The basic construction plans submitted by various mining bureaus last October did not consider the development of coking coal, an essential fuel for the steel industry, but instead prioritized civilian coal. For example, the Jingxi Mining Bureau planned four new pairs of shafts in its 1953 basic construction plan. They emphasized that "the population of Beijing and Tianjin is increasing daily, and it is necessary to guarantee coal for Beijing and Tianjin." While it is necessary to guarantee coal for Beijing and Tianjin, this must be guaranteed jointly with other coal mines; the mine could not fully guarantee it even with the addition of four pairs of new shafts. If the state invested too much in this mine, it would inevitably affect investment in other mines, especially coking coal. The coal mines under the Yangquan Mining Bureau all produce civilian coal. The coal produced by Yangquan Coal Mine cannot be sold locally and is mostly transported to Nanjing and Shanghai for sale. If it is transported to Beijing and Tianjin, the cost will be even greater than transporting it from Yangquan to Nanjing and Shanghai. Currently, production already exceeds sales, but the mining bureau also requests more state investment. Although the state's investment in North China coal mines this year has doubled compared to last year, such dispersed use would inevitably affect the needs of steel industry development. After this local perspective and egalitarianism were criticized, the mining bureaus producing civilian coal voluntarily reduced their plans according to the needs of the state, and concentrated funds on key construction. The North China Coal Mining Administration has now determined that Fengfeng and Datong mines (especially Fengfeng Coal Mine) will be the focus, and large-scale construction will be carried out.

    After the key construction issue was resolved, a second problem arose, namely, the mining bureaus' plans for the use of funds were too dispersed, and they did not consider that there should also be a focus in engineering projects. For example, although Fengfeng Coal Mine is the focus of North China's development, the mine's plan did not allocate the majority of funds to geological exploration, the most important link, but a large proportion of funds was used for general civil construction and other aspects. Due to the dispersed use of funds, the Yangquan Coal Mine did not have enough funds for the important projects of mining thin coal seams and preventing gas explosions. After reducing the investment plan, Jingxi Coal Mine did not concentrate funds on the drilling of new shafts, but instead planned to use a portion of the funds to purchase washing machines for workers. These erroneous thoughts and erroneous plans have been criticized after repeated review. It is now determined that the main focus of engineering projects is geological exploration. At the same time, depending on the different conditions of each mine, some will focus on the reconstruction of mine shafts, some on mining thin coal seams and preventing gas explosion projects, and some on improving transportation equipment.

    In order to complete this year's basic construction tasks and prepare for even larger-scale construction in 1954, the plan stipulates that basic construction organizations must be established and improved, and the strength of survey, design, and construction must be strengthened. It is determined that at least 50 percent of veteran cadres, at least 60 percent of new cadres, and at least 70 percent of technical personnel will be transferred from production departments to basic construction departments immediately. Currently, the cadres and technical personnel of the basic construction departments of Yangquan and Jingxing mines have been fully allocated and have begun to work; the main cadres transferred from Datong Mine have taken office. In order to strengthen the construction force this year and train reserve forces, the plan stipulates that in addition to running winter training well: more deputy positions should be set up in various departments; intermediate technical schools in Datong, Fengfeng and other mines should continue to be run well and expanded; and workers in various fields should be trained through short-term training courses and apprenticeship methods.

    华北煤矿管理局编出基本建设计划
    今年以发展炼焦煤为重点
    对各矿“百废俱举”的思想作了严格批判
    【新华社二十二日讯】为保证国家钢铁工业发展的需要，华北煤矿管理局批判了所属矿务局领导干部中“百废俱举”思想，编制出以发展炼焦煤为重点的一九五三年基本建设计划。
    华北煤矿管理局在编制一九五三年基本建设计划中，坚决贯彻了中央“重点建设”的方针，对局部观点、平均主义作了严格的批判。去年十月间各矿务局所提出的基本建设计划，都没有考虑到钢铁工业必需的燃料——炼焦煤的发展，而把民用煤放在第一位。如京西矿务局在一九五三年基本建设计划中，部署了四对新井。他们强调“京、津人口日益增加，需要保证京、津用煤”。京、津用煤需要保证，但必须和其他煤矿共同来保证才行，该矿就是增加四对新井也不能完全保证。假使国家对该矿投资过多，必然影响对其他矿特别是对炼焦煤的投资。阳泉矿务局所属煤矿全是民用煤，阳泉煤矿生产的煤，当地销售不了，多运往南京、上海一带推销。如果运到京、津增大成本的话，那么从阳泉运到南京、上海成本则更大。目前已产多于销，但该矿务局也要求国家多投资。虽然今年国家向华北煤矿所投资金比去年增加了一倍，但要如此分散使用，势必影响钢铁工业发展的需要。这种局部观点、平均主义思想受到批判以后，属于民用煤的矿务局按照国家的需要，都自动削减了自己的计划，把资金集中使用于重点建设，现在华北煤矿管理局确定以峰峰、大同两矿为重点（尤其是峰峰煤矿），大规模地进行建设。
    重点建设问题解决以后，又发生了第二个问题，这就是各矿务局在对资金使用的计划上太分散，没有考虑到工程项目中也应该有重点。如峰峰煤矿虽为华北发展的重点，但该矿的计划没有把大部资金用到地质勘察这一最重要的环节上去，而用到一般土木建筑和其他方面的资金占着很大比重。阳泉煤矿由于资金使用的分散，结果使得该矿对薄煤层的开采及防止瓦斯爆炸的重要工程资金不够用。京西煤矿在削减了投资计划以后，不把资金集中使用于钻探新井的工程上，却打算用一部分资金给工人购置洗衣机。这些错误的思想和错误的计划，经过反复审核以后，已受到了批判。现在确定工程项目中主要以地质勘察作为重点，同时，根据各矿不同的情况，有的以改建矿井作为重点，有的以开采薄煤层、防止瓦斯爆炸工程为重点，有的以改善运搬设备为重点。
    为完成今年的基本建设任务，并为一九五四年更大规模的建设作好准备，计划规定必须建立与健全基本建设机构，加强勘察、设计和施工的力量。确定立即从生产部门抽调百分之五十以上的老干部，百分之六十以上的新干部，和百分之七十的技术人员到基本建设部门。目前阳泉、井陉两矿基本建设部门的干部技术人员已调配齐全，并开始工作；由大同矿抽调出来的主要干部已到职。为加强今年的施工力量和培养训练后备力量，计划除办好冬季训练以外，还规定：在各部门中多设副职；继续办好和扩大大同、峰峰等矿的中级技术学校；以开办短期训练班、带徒弟等办法培养各方面的工人。
