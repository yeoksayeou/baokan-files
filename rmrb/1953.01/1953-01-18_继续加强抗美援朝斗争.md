Continue to Strengthen the Struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
(For Spring Festival Propaganda)

In the past year, our struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has achieved great victories. At the same time, our various social and political reforms and economic recovery work in China have been basically completed. In 1953, the central task of our people is to continue the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, carry out large-scale national construction, and strive for great victories in both aspects. At the same time, we will convene the National People's Congress to formulate a constitution.

I. Great Victories in the Struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the Past Year

The great victories we have achieved in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the past year are mainly:

First, we continued to annihilate the enemy in large numbers. In the past year, our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army together eliminated more than 241,900 enemy troops, including more than 100,270 American troops, and shot down and damaged more than 5,300 enemy aircraft. Including previous figures, our army has eliminated a total of more than 736,000 enemy troops, including more than 322,000 American troops. This number is equal to the total number of American casualties in the entire First World War, or more than one-third of the total number of American casualties in the entire Second World War. In addition, our army shot down and damaged a total of more than 7,800 enemy aircraft.

Second, our army has completely stabilized the front near the 38th parallel. Everyone remembers that in October and November 1950, the enemy had reached our border, the city of Chushan and the town of Hyesan on the south bank of the Yalu River, seriously threatening China's security. Because of this, the Chinese people had to rise up to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defend our homeland, and form the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to go abroad to fight. The question at that time was: could we repel the enemy? The heroic fighting of our army answered this question. From October 1950 to January 1951, our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army launched three fierce counter-offensives together, and quickly pushed the enemy back to the south of the 38th parallel. Since then, the two sides have been fighting near the 38th parallel. The new question at this time was: can we defend the 38th parallel? The fighting in 1951 answered this question again: our army defended the 38th parallel and continued to annihilate the enemy in defensive and counter-attack battles. However, at that time, there was still a phenomenon of the front advancing and retreating from time to time. Sometimes, after paying heavy casualties, the enemy could advance a little on certain sections. For example, the "Autumn Offensive" launched by the enemy in 1951 launched two key offensives successively. After paying the price of more than 80,000 casualties, they advanced six to eight kilometers in some local sections. But the situation in 1952 was different. No matter how many casualties the enemy paid, they could not advance a step. The Battle of Shangganling from September to November last year is a good example. At that time, the enemy concentrated more than 50,000 troops and a large number of aircraft and artillery to attack the hills defended by our army, but as a result, although the enemy paid more than 25,000 casualties, they could not seize a single hill or advance a step. In this way, the fighting in 1952 further answered the question of whether our army could defend the 38th parallel, because the front has been completely stabilized.

Third, our army has learned modern positional offense and defense tactics, worked hard, and become stronger as it fought. Everyone knows that our army's ability to fight mobile warfare is world-renowned. At the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951, our army defeated the enemy in mobile warfare and forced it to retreat to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. Later, the form of war changed to positional offense and defense warfare. The question at this time was: can our army fight modern positional offense and defense warfare? Now, this question has also been answered. After a year of training in 1951, by 1952, our army had completely learned modern positional offense and defense tactics. It was precisely because of this that the front was completely stabilized near the 38th parallel. The Battle of Shangganling mentioned earlier is the best example to illustrate that our army has learned modern positional defense tactics. Not only that, but our army has also learned modern positional offense tactics. For example, our army launched a series of tactical positional counter-attack battles in September and October last year, and successively occupied more than 70 enemy fortified positions, of which more than ten were firmly occupied by our army. At the same time, nearly 100,000 enemy troops were annihilated in these two months, including more than 35,000 American troops. In this way, the defensive operations of our army near the 38th parallel became active defense, that is, defense including a series of tactical offensive battles.

Fourth, we defeated the enemy's germ warfare. In order to vainly try to save their failure on the Korean battlefield and in order to vainly try to force our side to accept their unreasonable demands in the Korean armistice negotiations, the enemy launched germ warfare against the people of Korea and China from January last year, trying to use the method of spreading infectious germs to kill a large number of people in Korea and China. This heinous crime of the American aggressors seriously threatened the people of our country and the people of Korea. The question at this time was: can we defeat the enemy's germ warfare? The people of our country and the people of Korea defeated the enemy's germ warfare together, thus answering the above question. In the past year, our two peoples and people's armies have launched a comprehensive patriotic health campaign and achieved great victories. As a result, we have thwarted the enemy's germ warfare conspiracy and greatly improved the level of health and hygiene in our two countries' people and armies.

Our army was able to achieve the above great victories mainly because:

First, our army carried forward a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and bravely and intelligently eliminated the enemy and overcame various difficulties. Our army defeated the enemy, which had superior technical equipment, under extremely difficult conditions. This was not only because they had a fearless heroic spirit, but also because they were intelligent and clever. They figured out the enemy's situation and learned a set of methods to defeat the enemy. One of their greatest creations in combat was the construction of strong underground tunnel fortifications on a front of more than 200 kilometers—a magnificent "Underground Great Wall." Relying on this strong defensive position and other operational innovations, our army stood in an invincible position.

Second, our army received the full support of the people of our country. For example, in the weapon donation campaign from the second half of 1951 to the beginning of 1952, the people of our country donated funds equivalent to more than 3,700 fighter jets, which greatly strengthened the technical equipment of our army. Our army has established strong artillery units, air defense units, and increasingly powerful air force and other technical arms. Our army has also received a constant stream of manpower and materials. Although the enemy bombed our army's rear transportation lines day and night, thanks to the heroic struggle of our transportation workers, logistics workers, and air defense units, the materials in our army's rear were still continuously and increasingly sent to the front. This is the material basis for our army to continue to achieve victories.

Third, our Volunteer Army and the Korean people and People's Army were closely united, helping and supporting each other. At the same time, the Chinese and Korean people's forces also received the sympathy and assistance of peace-loving people all over the world.

II. The Enemy is Still Insisting on Conducting and Conspiring to Expand the Korean War

Despite our aforementioned victories, the American aggressors have not accepted the lessons of failure of the past two years. On the contrary, in order to enable American capitalists to continue to make a fortune in war and intensified war preparations, they continue to insist on and conspire to expand the war of aggression against Korea.

First, the United States unilaterally and indefinitely suspended the Korean armistice negotiations on October 8, 1952. Originally, the American aggressors were forced to agree to hold armistice negotiations because of continuous military defeats. However, they were also afraid that the armistice in Korea would relax the international tension and thus affect their arms expansion and war preparation plans. Therefore, since the armistice negotiations began on July 10, 1951, they have adopted various shameless methods to obstruct the progress of this negotiation. Thanks to our side's sincere efforts, by August of last year, the two sides had reached an agreement on all the clauses of the draft armistice agreement. However, the United States still refused to implement the provisions in the draft agreement that both sides had agreed on regarding the repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice, vainly trying to detain a large number of our captured personnel. In the end, it indefinitely suspended the armistice negotiations because of this. This proves that the enemy does not want to achieve an armistice, but wants to continue the war of aggression against Korea for a long time.

Second, then, on December 3 last year, the United States manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass the Indian proposal, which essentially supported the United States' forced detention of our captured personnel. This means that the American aggressors have further blocked the door to armistice negotiations.

Third, the American aggressors continue to massacre our captured personnel in large numbers. Only a little more than ten days after the United Nations General Assembly illegally passed the Indian proposal, the American aggressors created a new bloody massacre of prisoners of war in the Pongam Island prisoner of war camp on December 14 last year. According to the United States itself, in that incident, 87 Korean prisoners of war who demanded to be repatriated to their homeland were killed and 120 were injured. After that incident, the United States continued to massacre our captured personnel. In the past year, based only on the figures revealed by the United States and the figures admitted by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is used by the United States, more than 3,000 of our captured personnel have been killed and injured by the United States. This inhuman act of the American aggressors, which openly violates international law, proves that it has no intention of resuming armistice negotiations and reaching an armistice.

Fourth, the American aggressors continue to bomb and strafe the peaceful cities and towns and residents in the rear of Korea and the northeastern border of our country, and at the same time continue to carry out germ warfare against the people of Korea and China. Since the beginning of winter, the American aggressors have continued to spread insects, leaves, corn leaves, and other objects carrying germs in the front and rear of Korea and in Northeast China. This deserves our serious vigilance.

The American aggressors are not only continuing the war of aggression against Korea, but are also conspiring to expand this war. They are clamoring to launch a new "amphibious landing" offensive, and even say that they want to use Chiang Kai-shek's remnants to harass us. All of this shows that the enemy is not reconciled to failure, and they still vainly try to threaten us with so-called new "military pressure."

Obviously, all the above conspiracies of the American aggressors are bound to fail. The enemy has many difficulties. The enemy's casualties are huge; the consumption of materials is also huge; because of the failure of the war, the contradictions within imperialism and within the United States are becoming increasingly deep. The situation of our army is exactly the opposite. Our troops are becoming stronger and stronger, the source of troops and materials are sufficient, and the morale is very high. Our army's victory is fully assured. But since the enemy insists on conducting and conspiring to expand the Korean War, then we must not relax in the slightest in the future, but must greatly strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We must be prepared to smash the enemy's provocations and aggression in any place and by any means, so that the enemy will suffer greater failures. Only in this way can we achieve greater victories in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and can we achieve peace in Korea and the Far East.

III. How Should We Continue to Strengthen the Struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea?

In order to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of our country must do the following five things:

First, continue to deepen the self-education of resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea, overcome the ideas of neglecting the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and complacency and underestimation of the enemy, as well as other erroneous ideas. In order to make sure that everyone has a correct understanding of the great task of continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we must regularly conduct self-education on resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The "Patriotic Inspection Day" gathering system held weekly or every half month created by the residents of the Ninth Police Station in the Second District of Beijing and the masses of the Weishun Village in Pingding County, Shanxi Province, is an effective way for the people to regularly conduct self-education on patriotism. This method should be widely promoted among rural and urban residents throughout the country. In industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, and schools, current affairs learning about resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea should also be conducted regularly.

Second, strengthen the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. Each grassroots production unit and grassroots residents' organization must regularly and universally inspect and revise the patriotic production increase and economy plan and other patriotic covenants related to public security, health, culture and education, and the completion of various national work tasks. Everyone must learn from the Volunteer Army's high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and learn from the Volunteer Army's heroic struggle to overcome difficulties and its initiative and creativity to improve production and work efficiency, strengthen national defense construction and economic construction, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Third, earnestly do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers: effectively help solve all the living difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, help solve the employment problems of those among them who can do work; during the New Year and festivals, universally comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and also congratulate and report good news to the families of Volunteer Army soldiers who have made meritorious service on the front line. In short, everyone must respect and care for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; regularly care for and comfort the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army who come to the rear for recuperation; regularly write letters to the Volunteer Army, telling the Volunteer Army about the construction of the motherland, and encouraging the Volunteer Army to eliminate more enemies. Doing all this work well can enable the Volunteer Army to fight against the enemy more peacefully.

Fourth, earnestly do a good job in supporting the front line and comforting the troops. We must, at any time, according to the needs of the front line of resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea, fulfill our solemn guarantee to the Volunteer Army: "If you need money, we have money; if you need grain, we have grain; if you need people, we have people." At the same time, we must also guarantee that all kinds of materials needed by the Volunteer Army are good, and it is not allowed to supply poor-quality materials to the front. Local drama troupes should go to the Korean front line to perform consolation performances in a planned way.

Fifth, continue to strengthen the patriotic health campaign, further smash the enemy's germ warfare conspiracy, and improve the level of people's health and hygiene. To this end, we must continue to strengthen all anti-germ warfare measures, continue to do a good job in cleaning up garbage, protecting water sources, catching rats, eliminating flies, eliminating mosquitoes, eliminating fleas, eliminating lice, and eliminating bedbugs, and develop good hygienic habits such as washing clothes frequently, washing bath frequently, not drinking raw water, not eating raw vegetables and raw meat, and not spitting and defecating everywhere; before each "Patriotic Inspection Day" gathering, conduct a major inspection of patriotic health work. We must use these practical actions to implement Chairman Mao's instruction: "Mobilize, pay attention to hygiene, reduce diseases, improve health, and smash the enemy's germ warfare!"

In the situation where the people of our country take the above-mentioned various measures to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and in the situation where our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army continue to fight heroically, our victory is guaranteed. Let the people of our country unite as one, implement Chairman Mao's instruction on "strengthening national construction and strengthening the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea," and strive to achieve great victories in both national construction and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!

    继续加强抗美援朝斗争
    （供春节宣传用）
    过去一年，我们的抗美援朝斗争取得了很大的胜利；同时，我们在国内，各种社会、政治改革工作和经济恢复工作基本上已完成了。在一九五三年，我们全国人民的中心任务，就是继续抗美援朝斗争，进行大规模的国家建设，争取在这两个方面都取得伟大的胜利，同时，召集全国人民代表大会，制定宪法。
    一、过去一年抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利
    过去一年，我们的抗美援朝斗争所取得的伟大的胜利，主要的是：
    第一，继续大量地歼灭了敌人。过去一年内，我们的志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，消灭了敌军二十四万一千九百多人，内中美军占十万零二千七百多人；打落打伤敌人飞机五千三百多架。连以前合计，我军总共已经消灭了敌军七十三万六千多人，内中美军占三十二万二千多人，这个数字等于美军在整个第一次世界大战时期的伤亡总数，或者等于美军在整个第二次世界大战时期伤亡总数的三分之一以上。另外，我军打落打伤敌人飞机共在七千八百架以上。
    第二，我军已经使战线在三八线附近完全稳定下来了。大家都记得：一九五○年十月和十一月的时候，敌人曾经打到我们的国境——鸭绿江南岸的楚山城和惠山镇，严重地威胁了我国的安全。因为这样，我国人民才不得不奋起抗美援朝、保家卫国，组成中国人民志愿军出国作战。那时的问题是：我们能不能打得退敌人呢？我军的英勇作战回答了这个问题。从一九五○年十月到一九五一年一月，我们志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起发动了三次猛烈的反攻，很快地就把敌人打退到三八线以南去了。从那时以后，双方就在三八线附近作战。这时的新问题是：我们能不能守得住三八线呢？一九五一年的作战又回答了这个问题：我军把三八线守住了，并且在防御和反击战中不断地歼灭了敌人。不过，那时战线还有时进时退的现象。有时敌人在付出了重大伤亡以后，它在某些地段上是还能前进一些的。例如敌人在一九五一年所发动的“秋季攻势”，先后举行了两次重点进攻，在付出八万多人的伤亡代价后，曾在局部地段上前进了六公里到八公里。但是一九五二年的情形不同了，敌人不论是付出多大伤亡，都不能够前进一步了。去年九月到十一月的上甘岭战役就是很好的例证。那时敌人集中了五万多人的兵力和大量的飞机、大炮来进攻我军据守的几个山头，但是结果敌人虽然付出了二万五千多人的伤亡，却连一个山头也不能抢到，一步也不能前进。这样，一九五二年的作战就进一步地回答了我军能否守得住三八线的问题，因为战线已完全稳定下来了。
    第三，我军学会了现代化的阵地攻防战术，艰苦奋斗，愈战愈强。大家都知道：我军的会打运动战是世界闻名的。在一九五○年底和一九五一年初，我军曾经在运动战中打垮了敌人，迫使它败退到三八线附近。以后战争的形式即改变为阵地攻防战。这时的问题就是：我们的军队能不能打现代化的阵地攻防战呢？现在，这个问题也得到回答了。经过一九五一年一年的锻炼，到了一九五二年，我军便完全学会了现代化的阵地攻防战术，正因为这样，才使战线在三八线附近完全稳定了下来。前面说过的上甘岭战役就是说明我军学会了现代化的阵地防御战术的最好例子。不仅如此，我军又学会了现代化的阵地进攻战术。例如我军在去年九、十月间举行了一连串的战术性的阵地反击战，先后攻占了敌军坚强设防的阵地七十多处，内中十多处已被我军巩固地加以占领，同时在这两个月内共计歼灭了敌军近十万人，内中美军占了三万五千多人。这样就使我军在三八线附近的防御作战，变为积极的防御，即包括有一连串的战术进攻战的防御。
    第四，我们打败了敌人的细菌战。敌人为了妄想挽救他们在朝鲜战场上的失败，并且为了妄想迫使我方接受他们在朝鲜停战谈判中的无理要求，从去年一月起便对朝、中两国人民进行细菌战，想用撒布传染病菌的办法，来大量杀害朝中两国人民。美国侵略者的这种万恶罪行严重地威胁了我国人民和朝鲜人民。这时的问题是：我们能不能打败敌人的细菌战呢？我国人民和朝鲜人民在一起击败了敌人的细菌战，这样就回答了上述问题。我们两国人民和人民的军队在过去一年，展开了一个全面性的爱国卫生运动，取得了极大的胜利；结果我们就粉碎了敌人细菌战的阴谋，而且大大提高了我们两国人民和军队的保健卫生事业的水平。
    我军所以能够取得上述的伟大胜利，主要地是依
    靠着：
    第一，我军发扬了高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，英勇机智地去消灭敌人，克服各种困难。我军在极困难的条件下打败了在技术装备上占优势的敌人。这不但是因为他们有大无畏的英勇精神，而且因为他们机智聪明，他们摸清了敌人的情况，学会了一套打败敌人的方法。他们在作战中的最大创造之一，就是在两百多公里的战线上建筑了坚强的地下坑道工事——一座雄伟无比的“地下万里长城”。依靠着这种坚强的防御阵地以及其他各种作战方法上的创造，我军便立于战无不胜的地位。
    第二，我军获得我们全国人民的全力支持。例如，在一九五一年下半年到一九五二年初的武器捐献运动中，我们全国人民就捐献了相当于三千七百多架战斗机的捐款，因而大大加强了我军的技术装备：我军已经建立起强大的炮兵部队、防空部队和日益强大的空军和其他技术兵种。我军在人力和物资方面，也得到源源不断的补充和供给。敌人虽然日夜不断地轰炸我军的后方运输线，但是由于我们的运输工作人员、后勤工作人员和防空部队的英勇奋斗，我军后方的物资仍能源源不断地、越来越多地送到前线。这是我军能够不断取得胜利的物质基础。
    第三，我们的志愿军和朝鲜人民和人民军互相紧密团结，互相帮助和支持，同时中朝人民部队还获得全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和援助。
    二、敌人仍在坚持进行并阴谋扩大朝鲜战争
    尽管我们已取得上述胜利，但是美国侵略者并没有接受过去两年多以来的失败教训，相反地，它为了使美国的大资本家们能够在战争和加紧备战中继续发大财，便继续坚持并且阴谋扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。
    第一，美国方面已在一九五二年十月八日把朝鲜停战谈判无限期地中断了。本来，美国侵略者是因为遭受到不断的军事失败才被迫地同意举行停战谈判的，但是它又害怕朝鲜的停战会使国际间的紧张局势松弛下来，因而会影响到它的扩军备战计划，因此从一九五一年七月十日停战谈判开始以来，它又采取各种无耻的办法来阻挠这个谈判的进行。由于我方的真诚努力，到了去年八月间，双方本来已就停战协定草案的全部条款达成协议，但是美方仍然拒绝执行在这个协定草案中双方已经同意的关于在停战后必须遣返全部战俘的规定，妄图扣留我方大批被俘人员。到了最后，竟因此无限期地中断了停战谈判。这就证明：敌人不想实现停战，而要长期地继续侵朝战争。
    第二，接着，在去年十二月三日，美国又操纵联合国大会通过了实质上是支持美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的印度提案。这就是说，美国侵略者进一步地把停战谈判的门堵死了。
    第三，美国侵略者继续大批地屠杀我方被俘人员。在联合国大会非法地通过了印度提案之后不过十多天，美国侵略者就在去年十二月十四日在蜂岩岛战俘营中制造了屠杀战俘的新的血腥惨案。据美方自己宣布，在那次事件中，要求遣返祖国的朝鲜战俘被打死八十七人，打伤一百二十人。在那次事件以后，美方仍在不断地屠杀我方被俘人员。在过去一年内，仅就美方所透露的数字和美方御用的红十字国际委员会所供认的数字来统计，我方被俘人员被美方打死打伤的已经达到三千多人。美国侵略者的这种惨无人道的、公然破坏国际公法的行为，证明它丝毫不想恢复停战谈判和达成停战。
    第四，美国侵略者继续不断地轰炸扫射朝鲜后方和我国东北边境的和平城乡和居民，同时继续不断地向朝鲜及中国人民进行细菌战。入冬以来，美国侵略者仍不断地在朝鲜的前线、后方和我国东北撒布带有病菌的昆虫、树叶、苞米叶等物体。这是值得我们严重警惕的。美国侵略者不但正在继续进行侵朝战争，而且还阴谋扩大这一战争。他们正在叫嚣着要发动“两栖登陆”的新攻势，还说什么要用蒋介石残匪来骚扰我们。所有这些都说明：敌人还不甘心失败，他们还妄想用所谓新的“军事压力”来威胁我们。
    很明显地，美国侵略者的上述一切阴谋，是必定要失败的。敌人的困难是很多的。敌人的伤亡很大；物资的消耗也很大；因为战争的失败，帝国主义内部和美国内部的矛盾愈来愈深。我军的情况和这恰恰相反；我们的部队愈战愈强，兵源和物资都充足，士气很盛。我军的胜利是完全有把握的。但是既然敌人坚持进行并阴谋扩大朝鲜战争，那么我们在今后就决不能丝毫放松，而是必须大大加强抗美援朝斗争。我们就要准备着粉碎敌人在任何地方用任何方法进行的挑衅和侵略，使敌人受到更大的失败，这样，我们才能取得抗美援朝斗争的更大胜利，才能实现朝鲜和远东的和平。
    三、我们要怎样继续加强抗美援朝斗争呢
    为着继续加强抗美援朝斗争，我们全国人民就要做好以下的五件事：
    第一，继续深入抗美援朝的自我教育，克服忽视抗美援朝斗争和自满轻敌的思想，以及其他错误思想。为了使我们大家对于继续加强抗美援朝斗争的伟大任务经常都有正确的认识，我们就要经常进行抗美援朝的自我教育。北京市第二区第九派出所居民和山西平定县维社村群众所创造的每周或每半个月举行一次的“爱国检查日”集会制度，就是人民群众经常进行爱国主义的自我教育的有效办法。这种办法是应该在全国各地的农村和城市居民中广泛地推行的。在工矿企业和机关、学校中，也应该经常进行关于抗美援朝的时事学习。
    第二，加强爱国增产节约运动：各个基层生产单位和基层居民组织，必须经常地普遍地检查和修订爱国增产节约计划和其他有关治安、卫生、文教以及完成各种国家工作任务的爱国公约。大家都要学习志愿军的高度爱国主义和国际主义精神，学习志愿军英勇奋斗克服困难的积极性和创造性，来提高生产和工作效率，加强国防建设和经济建设，以支持中国人民志愿军。
    第三，认真做好拥军优属工作：切实帮助解决烈属军属的一切生活困难，帮助解决他们中间可以做工作的人的就业问题；过年过节的时候要普遍地慰问烈属军属，还要给在前方立了功的志愿军家属贺功报喜，总之大家都要尊敬和爱护烈属军属；经常关心和慰问来后方休养的志愿军伤病员；经常地给志愿军写信，把祖国建设的情况告诉志愿军，鼓舞志愿军更多地消灭敌人。做好了这一切工作，就可以使志愿军能够更安心地对敌作战。
    第四，切实做好支援前线的工作和慰问工作：我们要随时根据抗美援朝前线的需要，实现我们全国人民对志愿军的庄严保证：“要钱有钱，要粮有粮，要人有人”；同时我们还要保证志愿军所需要的各种物资，件件都是好的，不准把质量不好的物资供应前方；各地剧团要有计划地到朝鲜前线去作慰问演出。
    第五，继续加强爱国卫生运动，进一步粉碎敌人细菌战的阴谋，提高人民保健卫生事业的水平。为此，就要继续加强一切反细菌战的措施，继续做好清除垃圾、保护水源、捕鼠、灭蝇、灭蚊、灭蚤、灭虱、灭臭虫等工作，养成勤洗衣、勤洗澡、不喝生水、不吃生菜生肉、不随地吐痰、便溺等卫生习惯；在每次“爱国检查日”集会举行前都进行一次爱国卫生工作大检查。我们一定要用这些实际行动，来执行毛主席的指示：“动员起来，讲究卫生，减少疾病，提高健康水平，粉碎敌人的细菌战争！”
    在我们全国人民采取上述各种办法来继续加强抗美援朝工作的情况下，在我们的志愿军和朝鲜人民军继续英勇作战的情况下，我们的胜利是有保证的。让我们全国人民一致地团结起来，执行毛主席关于“加强国家建设和加强抗美援朝的斗争”的指示，为争取国家建设和抗美援朝斗争这两个方面的伟大胜利而努力奋斗吧！
