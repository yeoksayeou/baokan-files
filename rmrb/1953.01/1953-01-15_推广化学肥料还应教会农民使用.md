    Promoting Chemical Fertilizers Requires Teaching Farmers How to Use Them
    Ma Lincai
    With the development of the agricultural bumper harvest movement, in 1952, various parts of Shandong Province experienced a phenomenon where fertilizer supply could not meet demand. Shandong farmers were generally accustomed to using cake fertilizer and not accustomed to using chemical fertilizers. In order to achieve the goal of increased agricultural production and fully meet farmers' needs for fertilization, Shandong Party and government leading organs decided to vigorously promote chemical fertilizers, which have very high fertilizer efficiency. Over the past year, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, Shandong Province cooperatives sold 83.73 million catties of chemical fertilizers. This figure exceeded the original planned promotion number by 1.44 times, exceeding the amount of chemical fertilizers promoted in 1951 by thirteen times.
    Initially, farmers had many concerns about using chemical fertilizers. Therefore, teaching farmers how to use chemical fertilizers and fully exploiting the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers became the key to promoting chemical fertilizers. Local cooperatives opened many training classes to teach the technology of using chemical fertilizers, first training cooperative and district and township cadres, and then going deep into the masses to promote them. The Tai'an Prefectural Branch alone trained 96 cadres. Jiaozhou and other regions trained a large number of cadres through cadre meetings. Many Party and government leading cadres personally led the work of promoting chemical fertilizers. In Jimo County, because the county party committee attached importance to this work, it sold 1.1 million catties of chemical fertilizers in a short period of time. Liu Xueshan, a cadre of the Biguo District Cooperative in Zhaoyuan County, took 20 catties of chemical fertilizer and found mutual aid groups and production activists to help them apply it in their own fields. Ten days later, the corn that had been fertilized with chemical fertilizer grew very vigorously. He organized farmers to visit it and gave them on-site education. Last year, from January to August, this district promoted 130,000 catties of chemical fertilizer, exceeding the total sales of the previous year by twelve times.
    Facts have proven that as long as we patiently educate farmers, explain the rationale, teach the technology, and let farmers see the benefits of using chemical fertilizers, farmers will boldly use them. Some places have adopted methods such as "apportionment" and buying "bean cake with chemical fertilizer" through coercive orders, which have aroused farmer dissatisfaction.
    In 1953, Shandong farmers' demand for fertilization is even higher, and the burden on our fertilizer supply work is heavier. We will further summarize the experience in our work, learn from existing lessons, resolutely avoid the phenomenon of coercive orders, and do a good job in this year's larger chemical fertilizer sales work.

    推广化学肥料还应教会农民使用
    马林才
    随着农业丰产运动的发展，一九五二年山东各地出现了肥料供不应求的现象。山东农民普遍习惯使用饼肥，不习惯使用化学肥料。为了实现农业增产计划，充分满足农民施肥的需要，山东党政领导机关决定大力推广肥效很高的化学肥料。一年来，山东省合作社在当地党政机关和全国合作总社的领导下，销售化学肥料八千三百七十三万斤。这个数字超过了原计划推广数的一点四四倍，超过了一九五一年推销的化学肥料十三倍。
    开始，农民对于使用化学肥料有很多顾虑。因此，教会农民使用化学肥料的方法，充分发挥化学肥料的效能，就成为推广化学肥料的关键，各地合作社开办了许多教授使用化学肥料技术的训练班，首先训练了合作社及区乡干部，然后深入群众推广。仅泰安专区分社就训练了九十六个干部。胶州及其他地区通过干部会议训练了大批干部。有不少党政领导干部亲自领导推广化学肥料的工作。即墨县由于县委重视这一工作，短期内即推销了一百一十万斤化学肥料。招远县毕郭区合作社干部刘学善带着二十斤化学肥料，找到互助组和生产积极分子，帮他们在自己的地里施用，十天后，施用化学肥料的玉蜀黍长得十分茁壮，他就组织农民去参观，给以实地教育。这个区去年一至八月推广了十三万斤化学肥料，超出了前年全年推销数的十二倍。
    事实证明：只要耐心地教育农民，讲明道理，教会技术，使农民看到使用化学肥料的好处，农民就会大胆使用。有的地方采用了“摊派”、买“豆饼带化肥”等强迫命令的方法，就引起农民不满。
    一九五三年，山东农民的施肥要求更加提高，我们在肥料供应工作上的担子更重了。我们将进一步总结工作中的经验，接受已有的教训，坚决避免强迫命令现象，作好今年的更大的化学肥料推销工作。
