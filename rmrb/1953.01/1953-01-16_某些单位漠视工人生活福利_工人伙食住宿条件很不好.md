    Some Units Disregard Workers' Welfare
    Workers' Food and Accommodation Conditions are Very Poor
    To the Editor: I am writing to you about the daily life problems of construction workers. In the three years since liberation, the living conditions of construction workers in various places have greatly improved. Taking wage income as an example, the average wages of workers in various places have increased by more than double compared to the early days of liberation. However, because the leading cadres of some construction units emphasize the high mobility of construction workers, the seasonality of work, and that many workers are "part-worker, part-farmer," some even use the excuse of "being afraid of increasing project costs," they adopt a "just get by" attitude towards workers' welfare issues, and many things that should be done are not done. This makes the living conditions of the majority of construction workers on site still quite poor.
    Let's start with eating and drinking water. Some construction sites do not even provide enough boiled water to the workers. Some construction sites stipulate that workers are only allowed to drink boiled water after meals and during major breaks, and not at other times; workers have to drink raw water when they are thirsty. Some construction sites have very poor worker meals. According to a survey of seven construction sites in Harbin, the workers' meals were very bad. The reason is not that the food expenses are low, but mainly that the administrative leaders of the construction sites are indifferent to the workers' food problems. For example, some units lack education for cooks, so they often use leftover cornbread to make fires; they put leftover food in the open air; they put the flour on the ground, letting rats run around on it; small maggots are often found on newly bought garlic sprouts, radishes grow mold, and cooked dishes often contain mud. For example, at the 315 construction site of the Central Construction Engineering Department's directly affiliated engineering company, the workers spent more than 3,000 yuan on food every day, but for a period of time they could only eat steamed buns made of two kinds of flour, cabbage soup, and radish soup, and it was often not enough. Another example is the former Ninth Engineering Zone of the Directly Subordinate Construction Office, which once dug up more than 900 jin of white rice from the ditch where the cooks often poured out rice washing water. In this way, if the food is not well managed, it will naturally affect the workers' production morale.
    What is even more serious is the problem of worker sheds. In the past three years, many casualties have been caused by the collapse of worker sheds. One worker shed in the former China Construction Company and other factories collapsed during a heavy wind and rain, injuring thirteen workers and killing four. Some worker sheds leak very badly, "it rains heavily outside, it drizzles inside; when it stops raining outside, it is still pouring inside." For example, at the Hongshan District construction site of the Second Engineering Company affiliated to the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau, workers had to hold umbrellas all night to keep out the rain and could not sleep because the worker sheds leaked, and the workers sarcastically said: "We implement the assembly line method for work during the day, and we implement the 'leakage sit-up method' for rest at night." Many worker sheds have very poor ventilation and lighting, and the air inside is turbid. Some worker sheds are made of sorghum stalks, and soil often falls down. Some worker sheds have upper and lower bunks, and the lower bunk is close to the ground. Because the ground is damp, the workers' bedding is also often damp. This has a great impact on the workers' health. When Beijing conducted a city-wide safety and hygiene inspection last September, it was also found that many worker sheds were simply built with a few mats or stacked with dry bricks, and many worker sheds had roofs made of branches; these "houses" of course could not shelter from wind and rain. After the inspection, the Beijing Municipal People's Government made regulations on the construction of worker sheds, and the living conditions of construction workers in the city were greatly improved.
    Although many of the above situations occurred before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the living conditions of workers on construction sites are gradually improving. However, due to the fact that the leading cadres of some units do not care about the lives of the workers, this problem has not been well resolved so far. This year, as the construction tasks increase, the number of workers in various construction units will also increase. If the labor departments and trade union organizations in various places do not bring these issues to the attention of the construction units as soon as possible, it will be even more difficult to solve them after construction starts in the spring.

### 某些单位漠视工人生活福利  工人伙食住宿条件很不好

    某些单位漠视工人生活福利
    工人伙食住宿条件很不好
    编辑同志：我现在向你们谈谈建筑工人的日常生活问题。解放三年来，各地建筑工人的生活条件已经大大地提高了。以工资收入为例，目前各地工人工资平均已比初解放时提高了一倍以上。但是，因为某些建筑单位的领导干部强调建筑工人的流动性大、工作有季节性、许多工人是“半工半农”，有的更借口“怕增加工程造价”，对工人生活福利问题就抱着“能凑合就凑合”的态度，很多事情该办而不办。这就使广大建筑工人在现场的生活条件还相当差。
    先拿吃饭、喝水来说吧。有些工地就连开水也不能充分地供给工人。有的工地规定工人只准在饭后和大休息时喝开水，平时不给；工人平时渴了，就只好喝生水。有些工地工人伙食搞得很坏。据哈尔滨市七个工地的调查，工人伙食都很坏，原因并不是伙食费少，主要是工地行政领导干部对工人伙食问题漠不关心。如有些单位对炊事员缺乏教育，以致他们常用剩下的窝窝头烧火；把剩饭放在露天地里；把面放在地上，任凭老鼠在上边乱跑；新买的蒜苗上边常常发现小蛆，萝卜生了毛，熟菜里常带泥。又如中央建筑工程部直属工程公司三一五工地，工人每日拿三千余元的伙食钱，有一个时期只能吃到两合面的馒头、白菜汤和萝卜汤，而且还时常不够吃。又如原中直修建办事处第九工区，某次曾从炊事员经常倾倒淘米水的阴沟里，挖出九百多斤白米来。这样，伙食办不好，自然影响工人的生产情绪。
    更严重的是工棚问题。三年来因工棚倒塌，造成了很多伤亡事故。原中国建筑公司等工场的一座工棚，在一次大风雨中就倒塌了，砸伤十三个工人，砸死了四个工人。有的工棚漏雨很厉害，“外边下大雨，里边下小雨；外边不下了，里边还哗啦”。如中南建筑工程局所属第二工程公司洪山区工地，因工棚漏雨，工人彻夜撑伞挡雨，不能入睡，工人讽刺说：“我们白天工作推行流水作业法，夜里休息推行‘漏水坐夜法’。”有很多工棚的通风和光线都很坏，屋内空气混浊。有些工棚是用秫秸搭的，经常向下掉土。有的工棚里有上下铺，下层铺紧挨着地，因为地潮，工人的被褥也经常是潮湿的。这对工人的健康有很大影响。北京市去年九月间进行全市安全卫生大检查时，还发现不少工棚是用几张席子随便搭起来、或是用干砖码起来的，有不少工棚的顶子是用荆条搭的；这些“房子”当然不能避风挡雨。检查后，北京市人民政府对工棚支搭办法作了规定，全市建筑工人的住宿条件才大为改善。
    以上这些情况虽然有很多是发生在“三反”、“五反”运动前，而工人在工地的生活条件也是逐步在改善着。但由于某些单位领导干部不关心工人群众生活问题，至今仍未能很好解决。今年，各个建筑单位随着建筑任务的增多，工人人数也将增多。各地劳动部门和工会组织如不及早把这些问题提请建筑单位注意，春季开工后就更不好解决了。    张　扬
