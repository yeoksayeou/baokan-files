    Military Dependent Zhang Xianlian is a Mutual Aid Production Model
    Comrade Editor: Zhang Xianlian, a young woman from the seventh village of Longbei Township, Bazhong County, Sichuan Province, was allocated land and housing during the land reform. She clearly understood how this victory was achieved, so her political awareness quickly improved. When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, she encouraged her husband to join the army. She said, "If we want to live a good life, we must not let American imperialism run rampant, and we must defend our fruits of victory." After her husband joined the army, she actively took the lead in production in the village. Last spring, under the call of the People's Government, she mobilized everyone to organize mutual aid and jointly fight the drought. She took the lead in carrying earth, carrying stones, dredging dry wells, and finding water sources, leading the women to challenge the men. After overcoming the drought, she actively led the villagers in engaging in sideline occupations. Her mutual aid group opened an oil press, and all the income was invested in production. During the busy farming season, the village organized substitute farming. Not only did she not want others to farm for her, but she also took the lead in farming for other military dependents. She not only motivated the whole village but also motivated the whole township. All the paddy fields were ploughed and harrowed six times, ensuring a good harvest. She not only took the lead in production but also actively studied culture. Now she can write letters and keep accounts. Recently, she also gloriously joined the Communist Youth League and was elected as a mutual aid production model in Bazhong County.
    The spirit of military dependent Zhang Xianlian in actively taking the lead in fighting drought and engaging in production is worthy of commendation. Luogen

    军属张先莲是互助生产模范
    编辑同志：四川省巴中县龙背乡七村青年妇女张先莲，在土地改革时分到了田地和房屋。她很清楚地知道这胜利果实是怎么得来的，因此她的政治觉悟很快地提高了。抗美援朝运动开始，她就鼓励她的丈夫参军。她说：“要想过好日子，就要不让美帝国主义来逞凶，要保卫我们的胜利果实。”丈夫参军后，她在村中积极带头搞生产。去年春天，在人民政府号召下，她动员大家组织互助，共同起来抗旱。她曾经带头挑土、担石、淘枯井、找水源，领导妇女姐妹们向男子挑战。旱象克服后，她又积极领导村里人搞副业。她的互助组开设了油房，所得收入全部都投入生产。农忙时，村里组织代耕。她不但不要旁人给她代耕，还带头给旁的军属代耕。她不仅带动了全村并且还带动了全乡，所有的水田都做到六耕六耙，使丰收有了保证。她不但带头搞生产，还积极学文化。现在她已能写信和记账了。最近她还光荣地加入了青年团，并且被评选为巴中县互助生产模范。
    军属张先莲积极带头抗旱搞生产的精神是值得表扬的。 落根
