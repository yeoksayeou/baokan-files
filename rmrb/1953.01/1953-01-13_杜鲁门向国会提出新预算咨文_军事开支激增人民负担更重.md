Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: U.S. President Truman submitted a budget message to the U.S. Congress on the 9th. The new budget message demonstrates that the U.S. government continues to pursue a policy of foreign expansion and preparation for new wars, accelerates the militarization of the economy, and intensifies its plunder of the American people.

Truman's budget stipulates that the total budget expenditure of the United States in the 1953-54 fiscal year will reach $78.6 billion, an increase of approximately $4 billion over the estimated expenditure for the current year. Almost all of the increase is for military purposes. Military expenditure (including armed vassal states) totals $57.3 billion, accounting for 73 percent of the total expenditure. Direct military expenditure increases by approximately 4.3 percent over the current year, and 16.6 percent over the previous year; the cost of arming puppet regimes and promoting the expansion of armaments in vassal states increases by 17 percent over the current year. If we include the cost of veterans (mainly Korean War veterans) as subsequent expenditure for war, and the interest on the huge national debt accumulated for the purpose of war, the total military expenditure for the next year will account for 83 percent of the total budget expenditure.

The slight increase in civilian expenditure and the frantic increase in military expenditure in the new budget form a sharp contrast. For example, although the United States still lacks health and medical facilities and there are 13 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people, the so-called "social insurance, welfare, and health expenditure" totals only more than $2.5 billion, accounting for only a little more than 3 percent of the total expenditure.

Truman admitted that the main reason for the huge military expenditure is the continued expansion of the U.S. aggressive forces and the increase in military weapons. He also emphasized: "We cannot lower the targets of our military strength." Regarding "aid" to vassal states, Truman indicated that in the 1953-54 fiscal year, the United States will intensify the transportation of aircraft, artillery, and other military supplies to various vassal states and puppet regimes. He particularly boasted about the role of the United States in supporting France's colonial war in Vietnam, helping to suppress the Philippine people's liberation struggle, and supporting Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandits. Truman blatantly stated that U.S. imperialism will expand its anti-people military intervention around the world. He said: "Wherever it is needed, we will provide military assistance."

In order to raise the huge funds for aggression and war preparation, the only way for the U.S. ruling clique is to continue to intensify the exploitation of the American people. The federal tax revenue stipulated in the next year's budget totals more than $75.5 billion, of which more than half will be directly taken from ordinary Americans through individual income tax and consumption tax. According to the tax revenue stipulated in the budget, the average American will bear approximately $481. This is more than three times the pre-war level of 1940, and more than 41 percent higher than the peak during World War II. Despite the fact that the tax amount has increased so much, the budget will still have a deficit of $9.9 billion. Truman emphasized in his message: Congress should balance the budget, and the way to achieve balance is to increase taxes further.

### 杜鲁门向国会提出新预算咨文  军事开支激增人民负担更重

    杜鲁门向国会提出新预算咨文
    军事开支激增人民负担更重
    【新华社十一日讯】美国总统杜鲁门九日向美国国会提出预算咨文。新预算咨文表明美国政府继续推行对外扩张和准备新战争的政策，加速经济的军事化，并对美国人民加紧掠夺。
    杜鲁门的预算规定美国在一九五三—五四会计年度的预算开支总额达七百八十六亿美元，比本年度的支出概算增加约四十亿美元。增加额几乎全部是用于军事。总预算中军事费用（包括武装仆从国家）共达五百七十三亿美元，占总支出的百分之七十三。其中直接军费比本年度增加约百分之四·三，比上年度增加百分之十六·六；傀儡政权武装和推动仆从国家扩充军备的费用比本年度增加百分之十七。如果把作为战争的后续开支的退伍军人（主要是朝鲜战争的退伍军人）费用和为进行战争而累积起来的巨额国债的利息计算在内，下一年度的军事性支出总和将占预算中总支出的百分之八十三。
    新预算中民用部分开支的微少和军事开支的疯狂增加，形成了强烈的对比。举例来说，虽然美国全国还很缺乏卫生医药设备，失业和半失业的人有一千三百万，但所谓“社会保险、福利和卫生费”却总共只有二十五亿多美元，仅仅占开支总额的百分之三多一点。
    杜鲁门承认军事费用浩大的主要原因是由于要继续扩大美国的侵略军队和增加军火武器。他还强调说：“我们不能降低我们的军事力量的目标。”在对仆从国家的“援助”方面，杜鲁门表明在一九五三—五四会计年度内美国将加紧运输飞机大炮等各项军火给各个仆从国家和傀儡政权。他特别夸耀美国在支持法国在越南的殖民战争以及帮助镇压菲律宾人民解放斗争的作用和扶植蒋介石残余匪帮的努力。杜鲁门露骨地表示，美帝国主义将扩大在全球各处进行反人民的军事干涉。他说：“凡是需要的地方，我们就给予军事援助。”
    美国统治集团为了筹措进行侵略和备战的巨额经费，唯一办法就是继续加紧榨取美国人民，下年度预算规定的联邦税收共计七百五十五亿多美元，其中一半以上将通过个人所得税和消费税直接取自美国的普通人民。按照预算规定的税收，美国每人平均将负担约四百八十一美元。这比战前的一九四○年增加了三倍多，比第二次大战时期最高峰也增加了百分之四十一强。尽管征税额已经增加那么多，预算仍将有九十九亿美元的赤字。杜鲁门在咨文里强调：国会应使预算得到平衡，而得到平衡的办法就是再增加税收。
