Strengthening the Connection Between Schools and Production Units
Renmin University of China Sends Faculty to Lecture in Tianjin

    In order to better implement the educational policy of combining Soviet experience with China's reality, the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Section of Renmin University of China has, starting this semester, sent faculty member Wang Jiamo to Tianjin to lecture on "Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning" to cadres from various state-owned factories. The lectures have been warmly welcomed by the cadres, inspiring their enthusiasm for learning business and advanced Soviet experience, and helping to improve factory management. At the same time, through the cadres' discussions of the course, the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Section has also collected many practical materials from the factories, enriching the teaching content and helping to improve the teaching work.
    The lectures were conducted upon the recommendation of responsible comrades from the Tianjin Municipal Industrial Management Authority and the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. After Tianjin's relevant departments suggested that Renmin University of China send faculty to lecture, the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Section of Renmin University of China and the university leadership studied the proposal. They believed that this would strengthen the connection between the university and the factories, making it easier to obtain practical factory data to enrich the teaching content, so they agreed to the suggestion and decided to send faculty member Wang Jiamo to lecture. The lecture content is based on the lectures written by Soviet expert Professor Yoffe, and explanations are given as closely as possible to the actual problems of Chinese factories. It was determined that the entire course would be taught from September 13, 1952, to the end of March this year, with classes held every Saturday morning. The lectures are conducted on a relatively small scale. The sponsoring organization is the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for Heavy Industry. The students are limited to responsible cadres from several heavy industry factories, with no more than 300 people, forming an enterprise management training class. However, the number of people attending the first lecture exceeded the original plan, surpassing 500.
    The feedback has been very good since the course began. The students unanimously believe that the course is very relevant to the needs of their actual work. As a result, many other units have also requested to send people to attend, and the number of attendees has increased to more than 800.
    Due to the continued requests from various units to increase the number of students, the training class was taken over by the Industrial Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China starting last November. The number of attendees has now increased to more than 1,600, but various units are still continuing to request more places.
    Such a surge of learning is rare in Tianjin. In the past, the professional learning organized by various production units in Tianjin was mostly short-lived and could not be sustained. This time, not only has the learning been sustained, but the number of participants has been increasing day by day, and the students' enthusiasm has been growing. The reason for this is that the factory cadres urgently need to master their business, and this course is truly relevant to the needs of their actual work; in addition, the lecturer's clear explanation is also one of the reasons.
    The students currently attending the course include responsible cadres from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for Heavy Industry, the North China Textile Industry Administration Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and other units and their affiliated factories. In addition, other departments of the Tianjin Municipal Committee, trade unions and youth league organizations, various newspapers, the People's Bank of China, and other units have also sent people to participate in the learning. Faculty from Nankai University and various industrial cadre schools in Tianjin have also come to attend the lectures. Forty people from Tanggu and Dagu travel by train early in the morning to attend the lectures on class days.
    The students are organized into groups according to their production units. In addition to four hours of class per week, they also guarantee four hours of discussion (excluding self-study time). Each group writes a written report on the discussion and problems encountered each week and submits it to the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the lecturer.
    In the process of listening to lectures and discussions, the general units have checked the shortcomings existing in their work based on the courses they have learned, and studied the direction of improvement; some units have improved their work in a timely manner based on the methods they have learned.
    For example, after the "Management Organization" section was completed, most factories examined the relationship between the Party, administration, trade union, and youth league organizations, and clearly divided the tasks and powers of the various organizations. Some factories studied ways to improve their management organizations. After learning, some workshop directors recognized the role of foremen and gave them the necessary powers and responsibilities, changing the past leadership method of directly commanding workers. After the "Leadership Method" section was taught, each unit combined it with its current work and examined the work style of leaders at all levels.
    For example, after the "Principles of Planning Work" section was taught, everyone learned advanced technical norms, and many factories realized that the empirical statistical norms and average advanced norms used in the past were unscientific. Some factories are preparing to use advanced technical norms to prepare the 1953 plan.
    For example, when teaching "Organizing Technical Measures Plans," some factories were preparing the 1953 plan. They criticized the past lack of guaranteed quotas and the shortcomings in the past organization of technical measures plans based on the courses they had learned, and prepared the plan according to the newly learned methods.
    Although the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Section of Renmin University of China has obtained some practical materials needed for teaching during this teaching process, these materials are incomplete and not specific enough. This is because there are too many people attending the lectures, and there are many units to which they belong. It is difficult for the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Section to maintain close contact with each factory, and it is difficult to provide guidance, especially it is impossible to provide guidance according to professional fields. Therefore, it is difficult to collect practical materials for teaching work. In order to solve these difficulties, the Teaching and Research Section has selected several key factories and plans to send professional faculty to visit once or twice a month to provide guidance, help solve practical problems in various professions, and check the learning effect; on the one hand, it will establish a fixed and regular connection with these factories in order to collect practical materials needed for teaching work.
    This is the first time that Renmin University of China has adopted such a teaching method of directly sending faculty to production units to lecture. This method is undoubtedly also a teaching method for training cadres, and it is a method for rapidly training cadres in coordination with the country's large-scale economic construction.

    加强学校和生产单位的联系
    中国人民大学派教员到天津讲课
    中国人民大学工业企业组织与计划教研室，为了更好地贯彻苏联经验和中国情况相结合的教育方针，本学期开始，派教员王嘉谟到天津给各国营工厂干部讲授“工业企业组织与计划”这门课程。这门课程的讲授，受到了听讲干部的热烈欢迎，激发了工厂干部学习业务、学习苏联先进经验的热情，帮助了工厂管理工作的改进。同时，通过听讲干部对这门课程的讨论，工业企业组织与计划教研室也收集了工厂中的许多实际材料，充实了教学内容，帮助了教学工作的改进。
    这门课程的讲授，是中国人民大学采纳天津市工业管理机关和天津市总工会负责同志的建议而进行的。天津市有关方面提出请中国人民大学派教员讲课的建议后，中国人民大学工业企业组织与计划教研室和中国人民大学学校领导方面作了研究，认为这样可以加强学校和工厂的联系，更便于取得工厂的实际资料以丰富教学内容，所以同意了他们的建议，决定派教员王嘉谟前去讲课。讲课内容以苏联专家约菲教授所写的讲义为蓝本，尽可能结合中国工厂的实际问题进行讲解。确定自一九五二年九月十三日起至今年三月底止讲完全部课程。并规定在每星期六上午上课。讲课在较小的范围内进行。主办机关为中共天津市重工业党委。听课的学员只限于几个重工业工厂的负责干部，人数不超过三百人，组成企业管理训练班。但第一次听课的人数便突破了原定的计划，超过了五百人。
    开课以后，反映很好。学员一致认为这门课程非常切合实际工作的需要。因而另有不少单位也要求派人听课，听课人数便增加到八百多人。
    由于各单位继续要求增加学员名额，自去年十一月起，训练班便改由中共天津市委工业部接办。现在听课的已增至一千六百多人，可是各单位还在继续要求增加名额。
    这样的学习热潮在天津是少有的。过去天津市各生产单位组织的业务学习多半是虎头蛇尾，不能坚持下去。这次学习不但能够坚持下来，并且人数日益增加，学员情绪日益高涨。其原因便在于工厂干部迫切地要求掌握业务，而这门课程是真正切合实际工作需要的；此外，教员讲解清楚，也是原因之一。
    现在听课的学员包括中共天津市重工业党委、华北纺织工业管理局、天津市地方国营工业局、公用局等各单位及其所属各厂的负责干部。此外，天津市委的其他部分、工会和青年团组织、各报社、人民银行等单位也都派人参加学习。南开大学和天津市各工业干部学校的教员也都前来听课。塘沽、大沽有四十人每逢上课的日子，都起早乘火车前来听课。
    学员都按照生产单位编成小组，除了每周上课四小时外，还保证讨论四小时（自修时间在外）。各组每周讨论的情况和问题都写成书面报告，送交市委工业部及教员。
    在听课和讨论过程中，一般单位都根据所学课程检查了工作中存在的缺点，并研究了改进的方向；有的单位则根据学会的方法及时改进了工作。
    例如，在“管理组织”部分讲完以后，大多数工厂都检查了党、行政、工会、青年团等组织之间的关系问题，明确地划分了各种组织的任务和权限。有的工厂研究了改进管理组织的办法。有的车间主任在学习以后，认识了工长的作用，便赋予工长以必要的权责，改变了过去直接指挥工人的领导方法。在讲过“领导方法”部分以后，各单位便结合当前的工作，检查了各级领导者的工作作风。
    又如，在讲授了“计划工作原理”部分以后，大家学会了先进技术定额，很多工厂都认识了过去用的经验统计定额和平均先进定额都是不科学的。有的工厂则准备根据先进技术定额来编制一九五三年计划。
    又如，在讲授“组织技术措施计划”时，正逢有些工厂编制一九五三年计划。他们便根据所学课程批判了过去的定额没有保证和过去组织技术措施计划中的缺点，而按照新学的方法来编制计划。
    中国人民大学工业企业组织与计划教研室在这段讲授课程的过程中，虽然已经得到了一些教学所需要的实际材料，但是，这些材料是不完全的，也不够具体。这是因为听课的人数太多，他们所属的单位也很多，工业企业组织与计划教研室很难和各个工厂进行较密切的联系，难于进行辅导，特别是不可能按照专业进行辅导，因而为教学工作搜集实际资料也就困难了。为了解决这些困难，教研室挑选了几个重点工厂，拟另派专业教员每月去一两次，一方面进行辅导，帮助解决各专业的实际问题，并检查学习效果；一方面和这些工厂建立固定的经常的联系，以便搜集教学工作所需要的实际资料。
    中国人民大学采用这样直接派教员到生产单位去讲课的教学方法还是首次。这种方法无疑也是一种培养干部的教学方式，并且是配合国家大规模经济建设，迅速培养干部的方法。
