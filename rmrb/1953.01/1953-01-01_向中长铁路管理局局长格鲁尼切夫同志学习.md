    Learn from Comrade Grunichev, Director of the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration
    Wu Shaoqi, Hong Liu

    Comrade Grunichev, Director of the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration, is a person with noble communist qualities, who always treats his work from a national perspective and overcomes difficulties with Bolshevik spirit. There was such a thing: In the winter of 1950, when the climate was already minus 40 or 50 degrees Celsius, a certain station of the Sino-Soviet Railway received the task assigned by the state to transport machines. The machine weighed more than 30 tons, but the existing flatcar could only carry 30 tons. If the machine was placed on the flatcar, the flatcar would either bend or break into two or three sections. Comrade Grunichev always tried his best to overcome difficulties and complete 100% of any task assigned to him by the Central People's Government of China. When encountering major difficulties, he would go to the site to solve them. This time he came to this particularly cold station again. After a long period of investigation and research, and constantly talking with the workers, he finally came up with a method of connecting two flatcars, placing sleepers on both ends of the cars to reduce the load-bearing capacity in the middle, and then placing the machine on the sleepers. At that time, there was no translator on site, and he gestured to explain, personally using a ruler to measure how long the machine was and how large the sleepers needed to be. A line duty officer had been running around the site with Comrade Grunichev, and the two hadn't slept for three days. On the third day, Comrade Grunichev completed the design of the special device on the flatcar. At this time, Comrade Grunichev's face was already chapped from the cold, but he still concentrated on his work until all the transportation difficulties were resolved.

    In the past two and a half years, in leading the work of the Sino-Soviet Railway, Comrade Grunichev has shown a strong sense of national concept everywhere, treating the country's policies and laws with an extremely serious attitude. He first considers how the government stipulates when dealing with and deciding any issues, and sees if it violates national laws. At the Sino-Soviet Railway Advanced Workers Conference in 1952, he made a report, focusing on how financial work in enterprise production reflects national policies. He said: "The 1952 production and financial plan of the Sino-Soviet Railway was compiled based on the general policy of economic construction in Northeast China and in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy. The planned average daily loading volume in 1952 increased by 27.7% compared with 1951; the planned number of heavy vehicles received increased by 31.6% compared with 1951. From these figures, it can be seen that Chairman Mao's instructions on increasing production have been reflected in our plan. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's instructions on practicing economy, we also stipulated relatively strict consumption standards for labor, materials, electricity, and fuel in the plan." He also said: "After the production and financial plan of this railway for 1952 was formulated, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee made a decision in May on launching an increase production and practice economy campaign in state-owned and public-owned factories and mines. Comrade Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government made a report on launching a patriotic production competition in order to increase production and accumulate wealth worth 8 million tons of grain for the country by the end of the year beyond the plan. Although all employees of the Sino-Soviet Railway felt that the 1952 production and financial plan was very tight, they still warmly responded to the decision of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the instructions of Comrade Gao Gang. We discussed these two documents in detail and revised our tasks and plans once again. If we mobilize our potential forces and give full play to the initiative of all employees in creation and invention, then we can produce wealth worth at least 500,000 tons of grain for the country in the increase production and practice economy campaign."

    Grunichev's high mass viewpoint and collectivist thinking are also permeated in his thoughts and feelings. He attributes the achievements of each task to the employees. Once, at the site of a certain station where the temperature was minus 65 degrees Celsius, in order to encourage the loading and unloading workers to break through the cold and rush to load goods, he personally guided the loading method on site. Sometimes, he also participated in labor with the workers. One worker was moved to tears and said: "Director Grunichev has put so much effort into the construction of our new China, and his contribution is inestimable!" And Comrade Grunichev said after completing this rush transportation task: "This is the success of the workers' creation!" He praised the young weigher and the loading and unloading workers, but did not mention his own work at all. Because he believes that this is what a Bolshevik leader should do. Precisely because of this, Grunichev is also the best Bolshevik enterprise leader who supports the correct opinions of the masses, pays attention to the inventions and creations of the masses, and cares about and values the proposals of advanced producers. He maintains close contact with the masses through the scientific organizational structure of the enterprise itself and the key in-depth sections, stations, and workshops, and attaches great importance to cultivating new talents.

    His noble communist qualities are also reflected in his spirit of seeking truth from facts and self-criticism. There is such an example: In the winter of 1950, the tonnage hauled by locomotives in the Hailar area was very small and the speed was very slow. Grunichev personally went to Hailar to hold a drivers' meeting. At the meeting, he and the Chinese branch leaders jointly asked the drivers to give full play to their initiative and change this situation. He also personally went to a locomotive to check the firing method, operating technology, and the work of the driver and fireman. After the train arrived at Mianduhe, he realized that the reason why the train was running slowly and pulling less was not because the drivers were not active enough, but because the weather was more than 60 degrees Celsius below zero and the locomotive's cold protection equipment was not good. Therefore, after arriving in Boketu, he held another drivers' meeting, praised the drivers' initiative, and attributed the responsibility for not paying attention to improving the locomotive's cold protection equipment in advance to the Administration.

    The concentrated manifestation of the Bolshevik spirit of Soviet economic workers in their work is a high sense of responsibility towards the work they undertake. In leading the work of the Sino-Soviet Railway, Comrade Grunichev has always regarded the completion of the production and financial plan as the fundamental task. He said: "The plan approved by the state is the law, and it must be completed unconditionally!" He also skillfully combined a high sense of responsibility with his sophisticated leadership art. Every cadre of the Sino-Soviet Railway knows that Comrade Grunichev's greatest characteristic in leadership is to grasp transportation with one hand and finance with the other. In fact, this is the production work and financial work of the railway enterprise. He has always firmly grasped the two fundamental links of the railway enterprise.

    In Comrade Grunichev's work, mastering the transportation situation has become a way of life and a content of life. Every day, he personally presides over two transportation meetings: the shift handover meeting at 10:00 am and the telephone conference at 9:00 pm. Focusing on the loading problem, he separately checks the work of the Administration's various departments and branches for the previous 24 hours. This has been the case every day for more than two years without interruption. In particular, the evening telephone conference is held as usual on holidays and Sundays; even when going out to attend banquets, he leaves early to return to attend the meeting. Every time he goes on a business trip to other places, he also convenes reports by telephone as usual to guide the transportation of various branches. On National Day in 1952, he was invited to Beijing to watch the ceremony, and he still made long-distance calls every night to learn about the transportation situation. In order to ensure the completion of the transportation task, when the middle section of the Sino-Soviet Railway was destroyed by the flood in the summer of 1952, he also personally went to the flood site to direct the repair work. In order to ensure the completion of the transportation task, he often personally went to various places to find cargo owners to develop sources of goods, and often personally went to various branches to direct loading. In October 1952, when the transportation situation was very tense, he and Deputy Director Guo Lu came to Shenyang again. As soon as they got off the train, they told the director of the Shenyang Bureau to quickly convene the comrades in charge of transportation to a meeting. Then, hearing that a cargo owner meeting was being held at the station, they went to participate. After the meeting, they also presided over a telephone conference. At the telephone conference, he mobilized the director of the Shenyang Bureau to propose conditions for ensuring the completion of the loading task in order to influence other branches. On October 25, the loading task for the entire railway was still more than 3,000 cars short of completion, but thanks to his active supervision, the task was overfulfilled by the end of the month.

    While mastering the transportation plan, Comrade Grunichev also mastered the financial work with the same energy. Some comrades have said: "Soviet experts have a very clear and strong concept of accumulating more wealth for the country with the least amount of funds." This is also very prominent in Comrade Grunichev. He spends a lot of time every day listening to reports from financial cadres and learning about the progress and problems of financial work. He keeps a close watch on every expenditure. He always personally reviews the final accounts of various branches, focusing on finance and working capital, and checking them item by item. He constantly wages a tenacious struggle against various violations of financial discipline and waste. Once, when he was reviewing the final accounts of the First Branch, he found that many expenses exceeded the budget and the working capital also exceeded the standard. He severely criticized the director of the First Branch at the time and said: "Errors can be forgiven because you don't understand, but doesn't a branch director know to abide by financial discipline? Don't you know Chairman Mao's call to practice economy?" He is never sloppy about every small thing. He often says: "Economy should be noted bit by bit, at all times, and in many ways!"

    Comrade Grunichev's sophisticated art of enterprise management is combined with his scientific working methods. The scientific working methods of Soviet economic workers make work highly accurate and planned.

    There was such a thing: Once, the Harbin Railway Factory applied for materials. The plan proposed by the workshop was an exorbitant demand, but the factory directors stamped it and sent it to the Factory Affairs Department of the Administration without reviewing it. The department directors also stamped it casually. When the application form was sent to Comrade Grunichev, he carefully reviewed it and felt that there were too many materials required, but he did not immediately criticize it. He first sent a few people to the railway factory to investigate in detail. After clarifying the situation, he convened a special meeting and invited the factory director and the directors of various departments to participate. On the spot, he presented the investigation materials and asked the factory director: "Some have received more than a year's worth, and some have received more than eight months' worth. What are you doing with so many materials? What is the reason for this?" The factory director was speechless. On the spot, it was decided to punish them. The factory director and deputy director were each given a major demerit, and the director and deputy director of the Factory Affairs Department were each given a warning. The meeting was completed in just over an hour, and everyone felt that they had received a very profound and vivid education. Comrade Grunichev has always attached importance to investigation and research in his work, fully understanding the situation, and analyzing the situation thoroughly. Whenever he considers handling a problem, he assigns someone to collect materials and then personally participates in the research of the materials, personally correcting many tedious figures; he also requires the reports of the cadres below to be specific, practical, based on evidence, and analyzed. He never holds meetings to discuss or decide on the principles of handling any problem without researching the results and drawing preliminary opinions; his estimates and arrangements for any work are well-informed, neither adventurous nor conservative, appropriate, and he directs the work correctly.

    Comrade Grunichev's work also has a high degree of planning. He arranges in advance what things to do every day, what to do as soon as he goes to work, what to do before the 10:00 am meeting, what to do after the 10:00 am meeting..., everything is carried out according to the plan. Every month, he also has a monthly plan, when to convene what meeting, when to go out to inspect work, when to start solving a certain problem are all planned. Throughout the year, he also has an annual plan, when to lead the formulation of the plan, when to deploy the plan and mobilize the workers, when to review..., everything is planned. Therefore, although the organization of the Sino-Soviet Railway is so large and complex, he fully exerted his management art through such scientific working methods, and everything was arranged in an orderly manner.

    Comrade Grunichev will always be remembered in our hearts. The advanced experience and technology he taught us, and the Soviet qualities and style he personally demonstrated in his work, are examples for us to learn from.

    向中长铁路管理局局长格鲁尼切夫同志学习
    吴少琦  洪流
    中长铁路管理局局长格鲁尼切夫同志，是一位具有共产主义高贵品质，时刻以国家观点对待工作，以布尔什维克精神克服困难的人。有这样一件事：一九五○年冬天，气候已经是摄氏零下四、五十度了，中长路某车站接到国家交来的装运机器的任务，机器超过三十吨重，而现有的平板车却只能承载三十吨，要把机器放在平板车上，平板车不是压弯了，就会折裂成两三节。格鲁尼切夫同志对我国中央人民政府交给他的任何一个任务，总是想尽办法克服困难，百分之百地完成的。遇到大的困难，他就深入现场去解决。这次他又来到这个气候特别寒冷的车站，经过很长时间的调查研究，不时和工人交谈，终于想出了用两个平板车相联结，车上两头放枕木垛，减轻中部承载力量，再把机器放在枕木垛上的办法。当时现场没有翻译，他用手势比划着讲，亲自用尺子量机器有多长，枕木垛需要多大。一个线路值班员一直跟格鲁尼切夫同志在现场跑，两人已有三天没有睡觉，到第三天，格鲁尼切夫同志把在平板车上特殊装置的设计作好。这时格鲁尼切夫同志的脸已冻破，但他仍全神贯注地在工作，一直到全部解决了运输的困难为止。
    两年半来，在领导中长铁路的工作当中，格鲁尼切夫同志处处都表现了强烈的国家观念，以极其严肃的态度来对待国家的政策、法令，处理和决定任何问题都首先考虑政府是怎样规定的，看是否和国家的法令有违背。一九五二年中长路先进工作者会议上，他曾作了一个报告，着重讲到企业生产中的财务工作如何反映国家的政策的问题，他说：“中长铁路一九五二年的生产财务计划是根据东北经济建设的总方针并遵照毛主席关于增加生产、厉行节约的指示而编造的。一九五二年每昼夜平均装车量计划比一九五一年提高了百分之二十七点七；接运重车数量计划比一九五一年提高了百分之三十一点六，从这些数字可以看出，在我们的计划中已反映出来毛主席关于增加生产的指示。为了响应毛主席关于厉行节约的指示，我们在计划里也规定了比较严格的劳动力、材料、电力和燃料的消耗标准。”他还说：“本路一九五二年度生产财务计划拟订了以后，五月中共中央东北局作出关于在国营公营厂矿开展增产节约竞赛运动的决议，东北人民政府高岗同志作了关于开展爱国生产竞赛，以便到年底给国家多增加生产与超计划积累价值八百万吨粮食财富的报告。中长铁路全体员工对一九五二年度生产财务计划虽然感到十分紧张，仍然热烈地响应了中共中央东北局的决议和高岗同志的指示。我们详尽地讨论了这两个文件，又一次修改了我们的任务和计划。如果我们动员我们的潜在力量，发挥全体员工创造和发明的主动性，那么我们在增产节约运动中就至少能给国家生产价值五十万吨粮食的财富。”
    格鲁尼切夫的高度群众观点和集体主义思想也渗透在他的思想感情里面，他把每次完成任务的成绩都归功于员工身上。有一次，在一个摄氏零下六十五度的某车站的现场，他为了鼓舞装卸工人突破寒冷，赶装东西，自己亲自在现场指导装载法。有时候，他也和工人一起参加劳动。一个工人感动得掉下泪来说：“格鲁尼切夫局长为我们新中国的建设这样出力，功劳是没法估价的！”而格鲁尼切夫同志在这次完成突击装运任务后说：“这是工人的创造的成功！”他表扬了青年司磅员和装卸工人，关于他自己的工作，却一字不提。因为，他认为这是一个布尔什维克的领导人员份内应作的事。正因为如此，所以格鲁尼切夫也是一个最好的支持群众正确意见，注意群众发明创造，对先进生产者的提议十分关怀与重视的布尔什维克的企业领导干部，他通过企业本身的科学的组织机构和有重点的深入段、站、车间，保持着和群众的密切的联系，并十分重视培养新的人物。
    他的高贵的共产主义的品质，还表现在他的实事求是和自我批评的精神上。有这样一个例子：一九五○年冬天，海拉尔一带的机车牵引的吨数很少，走得又很慢，格鲁尼切夫亲自到海拉尔去召开了一次司机会议，他在会上和中国的分局负责干部共同要求司机们发挥积极性，改变这种情况。他并亲自到一个机车上检查焚火方法和操纵技术及司机司炉的工作。列车到了免渡河后，他查觉出火车开得慢和拉得少不是司机们的积极性不高，而是因为天气在摄氏零下六十多度，而机车的防寒设备不好的缘故。因之，到博克图后，他又召开了司机会议，表扬了司机们的积极性，而将没有事前注意改进机车防寒设备的责任归到管理局。
    苏联经济工作人员的布尔什维克精神在工作上的集中表现，是对待他所担负的工作的高度责任感。格鲁尼切夫同志在领导中长路的工作当中，一直是把完成生产财务计划做为根本任务，他说过：“经国家批准的计划就是法令，只有无条件地完成！”他并把高度的责任感和他那纯熟的领导艺术巧妙地结合了起来。中长路的每个干部都知道格鲁尼切夫同志在领导上的最大特点是一只手抓运输，一只手抓财务，实际上这就是铁路企业的生产工作和财务工作。他一直是紧紧地掌握住铁路企业的两个根本环节。
    在格鲁尼切夫同志的工作中，掌握运输情况已经成为生活规律、生活内容。每天，他都亲自主持两个关于运输的会议：上午十点的交班会议，晚上九点的电话会议，围绕着装车问题，分别地检查管理局的各处和各分局前二十四小时的工作，两年多来，天天如是，从来没有间断过，特别是晚上的电话会议，放假日、星期日也照例要开；甚至出去参加宴会到时也退席回来开会。他每次出差到外地，也照例在电话里召集汇报，指导各个分局的运输。一九五二年国庆节，他被邀到北京观礼，每天晚上还打长途电话了解运输情况。为了保证运输任务的完成，当中长路中段被一九五二年夏天的洪水冲毁了的时候，他也亲自到水灾现场去指挥修复工程。为保证运输任务的完成，他常常亲自到各地去找货主开辟货源，常常亲自到各个分局去指挥装车。一九五二年十月，当运输情况很紧张的时候，他又和副局长郭鲁同志到沈阳来，刚一下火车，就告诉沈阳局的局长赶快把管运输的同志召集起来开会，然后听说车站上正在开货主会议，又去参加，会后还主持电话会议。在电话会议上，他动员沈阳局局长，提出保证完成装车任务的条件，来影响别的分局。十月二十五日，全路的装车任务还差三千多车没完成，但由于他的积极督促，到月底却超额完成了任务。
    格鲁尼切夫同志在掌握运输计划的同时，也以同样的精力掌握财务工作。有的同志曾讲过：“苏联专家以最少量的资金为国家积累更多的财富的观念非常明确、强烈。”这一点在格鲁尼切夫同志的身上也很突出。他每天总花费很多时间来听取财务干部的汇报，了解财务工作的进度和问题。对每一笔开支都抓得很紧。各个分局的决算他一向是亲自审查，重点放在财务和流动资金上，一笔一笔地核订。他经常向各种违反财政纪律和浪费的现象进行顽强的斗争。一次他审核第一分局的决算，发现很多费用的支出都超过了预算，流动资金也超过了标准，他当时就严厉地批评了一分局的局长说：“因为不懂，犯错误可以原谅，但是一个分局长难道还不懂得要遵守财政纪律？毛主席的厉行节约的号召你不知道吗？”对每个细小的事情，他也是从不马虎。他常说：“节约应该是一点一滴地、时时刻刻地、多方面地注意才行！”
    格鲁尼切夫同志的纯熟的企业管理的艺术和他那科学的工作方法是结合着的。苏维埃经济工作人员的科学的工作方法，使工作有高度的准确性和计划性。
    有过这样一件事：一次哈尔滨铁路工厂请领材料，车间提出的计划是漫天要价的，但厂长们没审核一下就盖章送到管理局的厂务处，处长们也马马虎虎地就盖上了章子。请领单送到格鲁尼切夫同志那里，他仔细一审核，感到要的材料太多，但他并不立即批评，先派了几个人到铁路工厂去详细调查。把情况全部弄清之后就召集一个专门会议，把厂长、各处处长都找来参加，当场提出调查材料问厂长：“有的多领了一年的，有的多领了八个月的，要这么多的材料做什么？道理何在？”问得厂长哑口无言。当场就决定处分，正、副厂长各记大过一次，厂务处正、副处长各警告一次。只一个多小时就把会开完了，大家都感到受了一次非常深刻、生动的教育。格鲁尼切夫同志在工作中一向是这样重视调查研究，充分地了解情况，周密地分析情况的。每当考虑处理某一问题的时候，他都责成专人搜集材料，然后亲自参加对材料的研究，很多繁琐的数目字也亲自订正；对下面干部的汇报也要求把问题说得具体、切实、有根据、有分析。他对任何问题不研究出结果、不得出初步意见，从不开会讨论或决定处理原则；对任何工作的估计和布置，都是心中有数，不冒险也不保守，恰如其分，正确地指挥着工作。
    格鲁尼切夫同志的工作也具有高度的计划性。每天要做一些什么事情，他事先都安排妥当，刚一上班做什么，十点会议以前做什么，十点会议以后做什么……，一切都按照计划进行。每个月，他也有月的计划，什么时候召开什么会议，什么时候出去检查工作，什么时候着手解决某个问题都计划出来。全年，他也有一个年度的计划，什么时候领导订计划，什么时候布置计划发动工人，什么时候审核……，也全是有计划的。因此，虽然中长铁路的机构那样庞大、复杂，但他通过这样科学的工作方法充分地发挥了他的管理艺术，一切摆布得井然有序。
    格鲁尼切夫同志将永远被我们记在心里，他教给我们的先进的经验和技术，他个人在工作中所表现的苏维埃人的品质和作风，是我们学习的榜样。
