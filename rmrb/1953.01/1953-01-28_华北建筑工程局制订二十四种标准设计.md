The North China Construction Engineering Bureau Formulates Twenty-Four Standard Designs

[This newspaper dispatch] The North China Administrative Committee's Construction Engineering Bureau has formulated a series of standard designs suitable for medium and small cities in the North China region. These standard designs are divided into four categories: offices, dormitories, primary and secondary schools, and dining halls (cum auditoriums). Each category is further divided into sixteen types based on brick-wood structures, mixed structures, and the number of users. To meet the requirements of different users in different regions, dormitory buildings and office buildings, etc., are appropriately divided into three quality levels, high and low, in terms of decoration and equipment, resulting in a total of four categories and twenty-four types. Each typical design includes necessary documents and diagrams such as usage instructions, architectural drawings, component and door/window details, construction instruction charts, and labor and material analysis.

In formulating these standard designs, the North China Administrative Committee's Construction Engineering Bureau convened a symposium of engineer representatives from the original five provinces and two cities, and invited relevant construction units to participate in joint research.

To ensure that these standard designs are adapted to different conditions such as climate, geology, environment, and technical levels in various regions, necessary flexibility has been stipulated in architectural design, structural design, construction methods, and material usage. For example, roofs are divided into two types: with and without cold protection equipment. It is stipulated that thorough surveys must be conducted before using these standard designs, and designs must be made separately for those that do not meet the conditions to adapt to different soil qualities and water levels in various places. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of utilizing local materials, only material specifications are specified for materials, not brand names; for certain projects, two or more construction methods and materials are specified. For example, if grass paper ash is unavailable in Shanxi Province for interior wall plastering, it can be replaced with hemp fiber ash; ceilings are specified to use reed mats or slats to suit areas where reed mats are not available. This can save transportation costs and reduce construction costs.

These standard designs all pay attention to the principle of economy. For example, in order to save wood, roofs with a spacing of less than four meters all adopt hard gable purlins. Although the amount of brick used has increased, the wood used for roof trusses is saved; larger spans are designed as double-row houses as much as possible, so that the Soviet herringbone roof truss can be used, and fir wood can be used to save logs; the dimensions of door and window materials are also used to the minimum limit, and the types are simplified to facilitate factory production. For all wooden parts, efforts are made to use less or no Korean pine, and locally or nearby produced hardwoods are used as much as possible.

These standard designs also pay attention to absorbing and promoting advanced Soviet experience. For example, Soviet herringbone roof trusses and pre-fabricated concrete floor slabs are used in the structure. New construction methods are also used as much as possible in construction, such as spray application for plastering projects. At the same time, the design also takes into account the convenience of construction as much as possible. For example, in terms of construction detail drawings, the details of each component such as reinforced concrete beams and columns are made into separate drawings, and the steel bar dimensions, bending methods, and number of bars are listed in detail; the door and window details include the shape, section details, and material dimensions on one drawing. This makes the drawings clearer, allowing construction personnel and workers to see the whole picture of the component on one drawing, saving the time of copying details and making it easier for workers to grasp. In the labor and material analysis, the labor and material cost per cubic meter and the total engineering quantity are calculated, and each region can estimate the budget by multiplying this number by the local unit price. In terms of plan and elevation layout, efforts are also made to simplify, reduce unnecessary protrusions or corners, and take care of the convenience of using new bricklaying methods and plastering applicators during construction to reduce manpower waste.

At the beginning of the national large-scale construction period, general construction must take into account the existing economic conditions, but with the development of national economic construction and the gradual improvement of people's living conditions, if the designed buildings are only based on the existing lower conditions, they will inevitably fail to meet the needs. In order to solve this contradiction, the Bureau decided to design according to long-term reasonable design standards, and limit the number of users and equipment according to the current conditions. For example, single dormitories are designed according to a net area of 14.75 square meters for three people, but at present they are temporarily used by five to six people; for example, central heating cannot be universally installed at present, but for buildings that are planned to install central heating in the future, holes and pipe trenches for installing central heating are pre-reserved in the design. This takes into account both the current national economic conditions and the future development prospects.

In the process of formulating each type of standard design, a principle should also be observed, that is, attention must be paid to the relationship between the whole and the individual, and whether the future overall layout method is suitable for the requirements of urban planning. If only the individual is considered instead of the whole, it may cause great waste. For example, constructing multiple rows of flat dormitories is very economical and applicable from the perspective of each building, but from the perspective of the overall plan and municipal construction, it wastes the base area and increases the equipment costs of road systems, heating, sanitation, water supply, and electricity, which is very uneconomical. At the beginning, the Bureau had this tendency, considering the plan, elevation design, and construction practices of the buildings themselves more comprehensively, but rarely considering the overall situation. After instructions from higher authorities and hearing the criticisms of Soviet experts on the newly built workers' dormitories in Tianjin, the Bureau revised the original preliminary design plan, considered several plan layout schemes, increased the building design of schools, reduced the types of flat buildings, and stipulated in the usage instructions that the overall layout plan must be designed in accordance with the specific conditions of the base and urban construction planning.

In the process of formulating these standard designs, the Bureau had some disputes with different opinions, and there were also two other deviations. One was that typical designs "must be unified in everything," regardless of the different situations in various provinces and cities in North China, blindly seeking unity for the sake of unity; nor did it consider "local materials," and even wanted to make mechanical regulations on material brands. Another deviation was to consider aesthetics too much, with a wide variety of components (such as doors and windows). In addition, individual engineers did not consider the current national economic situation and blindly believed that the standard design should be significantly different from the ordinary designs in various places and should be "one level higher." These thoughts and deviations have been corrected. (Pan Fu, Zhang Zhaoquan)

    华北建筑工程局制订二十四种标准设计
    【本报讯】华北行政委员会建筑工程局制定了一部分适合华北区中、小城市的标准设计。这些标准设计共分办公室、宿舍、中小学校、饭厅（兼礼堂）等四类，各类又分别按砖木结构与混合结构及使用人数分为十六种。为适应不同地区使用单位的要求，又将宿舍楼、办公楼等在装修上、设备上适当地分为高低不同的三种质量，共计为四类二十四种。每种典型设计都有使用说明、建筑图样、构件及门窗大样、施工说明图表、工料分析等必要的文件及图案。
    在制定这些标准设计时，华北行政委员会建筑工程局曾召集原五省二市的工程师代表举行座谈，并邀请有关建筑单位参加共同研究。
    为使这些标准设计适应各地区气候、地质、环境、技术高低不同等条件，在建筑设计及结构设计、施工作法、材料使用等方面都规定了必要的灵活性。例如屋顶分有防寒设备及无防寒设备两种；规定在使用这些标准设计前必须经过周密勘测，不合条件者必须另作设计，以适应各地不同的土质及水位。同时依就地取材的精神，对用料只规定材料规格，不指定牌号；对某些工程规定了两种以上的作法和用料。如内墙抹灰，因山西省无草纸灰，规定可改用麻刀灰；顶篷规定用苇箔或板条，以适合无苇箔地区的情况。这样就可以节省运费，降低建筑成本。
    这些标准设计都注意了节约的原则。例如为了节约木料，间距四公尺以内的屋顶，都采用了硬山櫊檩，虽然砖的用量增多了，但节省了屋架所用木材；间距较大的则尽可能设计为双排房屋，以便采用苏联人字屋架，使用杉木，节约原木；门窗用料尺寸也用到了最小的限度，并简化了种类，以利工厂生产。凡使用木料部分，都争取少用或不用红松，尽量采用当地或临近地区出产的硬杂木。
    这些标准设计，还注意了吸取和推广苏联先进经验。如在结构上采用了苏联人字屋架，预制混凝土楼板。在施工上也尽量运用现有的新工作法，例如粉刷工程上的喷浆法等。同时在设计中并尽可能地照顾了施工上的方便，例如在施工详图方面，将钢筋混凝土梁柱等每一部件的大样单制一图，列表详注钢筋尺寸、弯法及根数；门窗大样在一张图纸上包括了形状、截面大样、用料尺寸等。这就可以使图样比较明确，使施工人员与工人能在一张图案上看出这一构件的全貌，节省了翻大样的时间，并使工人易于掌握。在工料分析上，算好单方工料及工科总量，各地以此数乘当地单价，即能估出预算。在平面、立面布置上，也力求简化，减少不必要的凸凹或棱角，照顾施工时便于使用新砌砖法与铺灰器等先进工具，减少人力浪费。
    在国家大规模建设开始时期，一般建筑必须考虑到现有的经济条件，但是随着国家经济建设的发展，人民生活条件逐步提高，如只从现有较低条件出发，设计出的建筑物必然不能适合需要。为了解决这一矛盾，该局决定依长远的合理的设计标准进行设计，根据目前的条件限制使用人数及设备。例如单身宿舍按三人使用净面积一四点七五平方公尺做出设计，在目前则暂由五至六人使用；再如目前不能普遍安装暖气，但对于将来准备安装暖气的楼房建筑，在设计时预先留出安装暖气的孔道、管沟。这样既照顾了目前国家的经济条件，又照顾了将来的发展前途。
    在制定每一类型的标准设计时，还应该遵守一个原则，就是必须注意整体与个体的关系，考虑到将来使用总平面的布置方法是否适合城市规划的要求。如果只从个体而不从整体来考虑，就可能造成很大浪费。例如建筑多幢平房宿舍，从每一幢建筑上来考虑是很经济适用的，但从总平面及市政建设上看，却浪费了基地面积，增加了道路系统及暖气、卫生、水道、电气等的设备费，这就很不经济。开始时该局曾发生过这种偏向，对建筑物本身的平面、立面设计及施工做法等考虑较为周密，而对整体很少考虑。后经上级指示并听到苏联专家对天津新建工人宿舍的批评意见后，该局便对原来的初步设计计划做了修改，考虑了几种平面布置方案，增加了学校的楼房设计，减少了平房的种类，并在使用说明上规定了必须按照基地的具体情况及城市建设规划，设计总平面布置图。
    在制定这些标准设计的过程中，该局曾有过一些不同意见的争论，并发生过另外两种偏向。一种是认为典型设计“一切都要统一”，不考虑华北各省、市情况不同，盲目地为统一而统一；也不考虑
    “就地取材”，连材料的牌号都想作机械规定。另
    一种偏向是过多地考虑美观，部分构件（如门窗）种类繁多。此外，还有个别工程师不考虑目前国家经济情况，盲目地认为标准设计应与各地普通设计有显著的不同，应该“高一等”。这些思想和偏向，都得到了纠正。　（潘复、张肇铨）
