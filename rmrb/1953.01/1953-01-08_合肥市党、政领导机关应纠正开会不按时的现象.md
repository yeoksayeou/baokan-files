    Hefei Municipal Party and Government Leading Organs Should Correct the Phenomenon of Not Starting Meetings on Time
    Editor: Many organs in Hefei City, Anhui Province, do not start meetings on time, and those presiding over the meetings arbitrarily arrive late and prolong the meeting time. For example, on November 12th last year, the Wage Reform Meeting convened by the Hefei Municipal Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was notified to start at 8:00 AM. We arrived on time, but the person presiding over the meeting did not arrive until 9:30 AM, wasting everyone's time for more than an hour.
    From November 16th to 19th last year, Hefei City held the Third Workers' Representative Conference. The scheduled time for the morning sessions was 7:30 AM, but the people presiding over the conference rarely arrived on time. On the last day of the conference, many people sacrificed their morning study time to listen to the concluding report, waiting from 7:00 AM until after 9:00 AM, but the person presiding over the meeting had not yet arrived. The report time was very long, with no break at noon, and it continued until it was almost dark before the meeting adjourned.
    On November 21st last year, the Hefei Municipal Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Committee held a meeting, and the notified time was 6:00 PM. One comrade who was to attend the meeting had already finished work at 5:30 PM, so he hurriedly finished dinner and rode his bicycle to the meeting. By this time, it was already dark, and it was raining heavily. He accidentally knocked down a child. He took the child to the hospital for examination and treatment, which took an hour. He arrived at the meeting at 7:00 PM, but the people for the meeting had not all arrived yet.
    The above are just a few examples. This phenomenon is very common in Hefei City.
    I believe that the reason why this phenomenon occurs is certainly related to the habit of not being punctual, but the key lies in the fact that leading cadres lack a mass perspective and do not cherish the time of the comrades attending the meeting. This is a very bad trend, and I hope that the Hefei Municipal Party and Government Leading Organs will pay attention to this issue.

### 合肥市党、政领导机关应纠正开会不按时的现象

    合肥市党、政领导机关应纠正开会不按时的现象
    编辑同志：安徽省合肥市很多机关开会不按时，主持会议的人则随意迟到和拖长会议时间。如去年十一月十二日，中共合肥市工厂委员会召开的工资改革会议，通知在上午八点钟开会。我们准时赶去，结果主持会议的人等到九点半钟才到。浪费了大家一个多钟头。
    去年十一月十六日到十九日，合肥市召开第三届工人代表会议。上午开会的时间，规定是七点半；可是主持大会的人，很少按时到会。大会最后一天，有很多人牺牲了早晨的学习去听总结报告，从七点钟等到九点多钟，主持会议的人还没有来。报告时间很长，中午没有休息，直开到天快黑才散会。
    去年十一月二十一日，合肥市清理资产核定资金委员会开会，通知的时间是下午六点钟。有一位要参加会议的同志，因为下办公已是下午五点半钟了，急忙吃完饭，骑着自行车去开会。这时，天已黑了，又正下着大雨，一不小心碰倒了一个小孩子。他把小孩送到医院去检查、诊疗，花了一个钟头，到七点钟，才赶到会场，可是开会的人，还没到齐。
    上面所举的不过是几个例子，这种现象在合肥市是非常普遍的。
    我认为：所以发生这种现象，固然和没有遵守时间的习惯有一定的关系，但关键还在于领导干部缺乏群众观点，不珍惜与会同志们的时间。这是很坏的风气，希望合肥市党、政领导机关重视这个问题。
