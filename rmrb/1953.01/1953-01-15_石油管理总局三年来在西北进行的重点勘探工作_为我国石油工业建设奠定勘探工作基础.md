The Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has vigorously carried out focused and systematic petroleum geological exploration work in the Northwest region over the past three years, laying the foundation for future large-scale petroleum industry construction.

First, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the erroneous perception that "China's oil resources are not rich" was refuted from all aspects, establishing confidence in the development of New China's petroleum industry. For example, the geological conditions of the four basins of Jiuquan, Chaoshui, Minhe, and northern Shaanxi have been initially clarified, and new oil layers have been discovered in the Yongping structure, eliminating the past purely conceptual and subjective conclusions. A lot of data was obtained during the investigation of the above-mentioned basins, and many structures were discovered, which can be used as objects for further work in the future.

Second, there has been significant improvement in technology. The foundation of underground geological work was very weak in the past, and general geological personnel did not understand the correct methods of underground geological work. Now, under the guidance of Soviet expert Moseev, a systematic set of underground geological work methods has been established. As a result, the underground geological oil layer horizons and the conditions of oil, gas, and water can be clearly analyzed. The phenomenon of geological personnel not paying attention to actual engineering in the past has been corrected, a responsibility system has been established, and accurate geological data has been provided as the design standard for engineering plans. In terms of surface geology, the work efficiency and quality (accuracy) have been greatly improved due to the adoption of advanced Soviet technology—the geological point method. In terms of drilling technology, the maximum depth that could be drilled in the past was only over 900 meters, but now it can reach below 2,000 meters.

Third, a large number of exploration cadres have been trained. Interns from 1950 are now able to work independently, and some have assumed the responsible positions for the geology of exploration areas. The number of geological teams has increased from six to thirty, and the number of geophysical drilling teams has increased from two to sixteen. An unprecedented seismic exploration team has been established, and the first batch of female field exploration personnel has also been trained. In addition, the number of drilling rigs has tripled, and the footage drilled has increased from 2,000 meters per year before liberation to more than 20,000 meters.

In order to meet the needs of the motherland's large-scale economic construction and improve petroleum geological work, the Petroleum Administration Bureau has been concentrating field workers in batches for study, and the first phase is currently entering the stage of summarizing experience.

    石油管理总局三年来在西北进行的重点勘探工作
    为我国石油工业建设奠定勘探工作基础
    中央人民政府燃料工业部石油管理总局，三年来大力在西北地区进行有重点、有步骤的石油地质探勘工作，为今后大规模石油工业建设奠定了探勘工作基础。
    第一个成就是经过苏联专家的指导，从各方面否定了“中国石油资源不富”的错误认识，对新中国石油工业的发展树立了信心。如对酒泉、潮水、民和、陕北等四个盆地，初步搞清了一部分地质情况，永坪构造新发现了油层；扫除了过去只是概念、主观的论断。在上述盆地进行调查中，得到不少资料，发现了不少构造，可以作为今后进一步工作的对象。
    二、在技术上已有显著提高。地下地质工作过去基础很弱，一般地质人员不懂地下地质工作的正确方法。现在在苏联专家莫谢耶夫指导下，建立了一套有系统的地下地质工作方法，因而对地下地质油层层位，油、气、水的情况都能分析清楚，并纠正了过去地质人员不问实际工程的现象，建立了责任制，提供正确的地质资料作为工程计划的设计标准。在地面地质方面，由于采用了苏联先进技术——地质点法，工作效率和工作质量（精确性）大大提高。在钻井技术方面，过去只能打九百多公尺深，现在已能打到二千公尺以下了。
    三、培养了大批探勘干部。一九五零年的实习员，现在已能独立工作，有的已担负探区地质的负责职务。地质队由六个发展到三十个，地质物理钻勘队由二个发展到十六个，并成立了前所未有的地震探勘队，而且还培养了第一批女的野外探勘人员。另外，钻机增加了三倍，钻井进尺由解放前一年二千公尺，提高到二万公尺以上。
    为适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要，把石油地质工作提高一步，石油管理总局已分批集中野外工作同志进行学习，目前第一期正进入总结经验阶段。
