    Should Cooperatives Be Established on Basic Construction Sites?
    Construction workers in basic construction sites have requested that cooperatives come to the sites to supply materials. We consulted the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on this matter, and they replied that cooperatives should not be developed on construction sites. However, we also received a letter from Comrade Gao Yuan of the Beijing New Urban District United Consumer Cooperative, stating that they have already established cooperatives on basic construction sites and have received enthusiastic support from the workers. We are now publishing these two letters, hoping that everyone will offer their opinions. The letter from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives stated: "It is also not very suitable for workers on construction sites to raise shares themselves to organize their own consumer cooperatives, because the construction time is not long and the workers have high mobility." Therefore, they believe that cooperatives still feel it is difficult to undertake the task of supplying materials to construction sites at present. However, Comrade Gao Yuan, from his practical work experience, not only proved that construction workers urgently want to join cooperatives, but also proved that establishing cooperative organizations on construction sites is necessary and possible.
    We believe that the reason why the Beijing New Urban District United Consumer Cooperative's practice of developing organizations and establishing institutions on construction sites has received enthusiastic support and backing from the broad masses of workers, trade unions, and administrative departments is because they attach importance to the demands of the masses and because they can adapt to the development of new situations and needs in their work.
    At present, what China is about to begin is an unprecedentedly large-scale basic construction; and on every construction site, there are tens of thousands of workers gathered. These projects are not small projects lasting only a year or six months; and about 80% of these workers are fixed workers and seasonal workers under contract (generally for one year). Therefore, "short construction time and high worker mobility" should be the situation during the recovery phase of the motherland, not the situation after the start of large-scale construction.
    Secondly, since cooperatives are mass economic organizations established by members themselves raising shares; and consumer cooperatives mainly target workers, staff, etc., it is a perfectly legitimate demand for the broad masses of construction workers to hope to establish their own consumer cooperatives to solve the difficulties of material supply on construction sites. Developing organizations and "simply meeting the supply and sales requirements of the members" are not only not contradictory, but consistent; and only by first developing the organization can the business policy of "serving the members" be realized.
    Thirdly, some people also believe that: "When the project is over, members always have to withdraw from the cooperative. According to the provisions of the cooperative's articles of association, members who withdraw voluntarily will not be able to share dividends or have their membership fees (2,000 yuan) refunded. This will cause dissatisfaction among the members." The fact is not like this. According to the statistics of the Beijing New Urban District United Consumer Cooperative, in 1951, among the 2,000 construction worker members of the cooperative, about one-quarter withdrew from the cooperative during the winter off-season; while in 1952, among the more than 8,000 construction worker members, only 150 withdrew from the cooperative during the winter off-season. This not only shows that very few workers want to withdraw from the cooperative, but also shows that worker mobility is not very high.
    Of course, whether or not cooperatives should develop organizations among construction workers and whether or not institutions should be established on basic construction sites is a major issue of principle. The demands of construction workers are clear, the practices in Beijing have been successful, and how should the All-China Federation of Cooperatives deal with this issue? We hope that readers will conduct research and offer opinions, and we hope even more that the All-China Federation of Cooperatives will conduct research based on the experience of the Beijing New Urban District United Consumer Cooperative and offer opinions.

### 在基本建设工地里应不应该建立合作社

    在基本建设工地里应不应该建立合作社
    基本建设工地中的建筑工人要求合作社到工地里去作物资供应工作，我们为这事曾经征求全国合作总社的意见，他们来信答复说不应该在工地里发展合作社。但是我们又收到北京新市区联合消费合作社高原同志来信说他们已经在基本建设工地里建立合作社，得到工人同志热烈拥护。现在我们发表这两封信，希望大家提出意见。全国合作总社来信说：“工地工人自己凑集股金组织自己的消费合作社，也因施工时间不长，工人流动性较大，恐亦不大适宜。”因此他们认为：合作社对于担负工地物资供应这一任务，在目前尚感困难。但高原同志从他实际工作的体验中，不仅证明了建筑工人都非常迫切地要求加入合作社，而且证明了在工地设立合作社机构是应该而且是可能的。
    我们认为北京市新市区联合消费合作社在工地发展组织和设立机构的作法，所以得到广大工人、工会和行政方面的热烈拥护和支持，就是因为他们重视了群众的要求，就是因为他们能适应新的形势的发展和需要进行工作。
    目前我国即将开始的，是空前巨大规模的基本建设；而在每一个建设工地上，又都聚集着成千上万的工人。这些工程既不是一年半载的小工程；而这些工人中的百分之八十左右又都为固定工和订立合同的季节工（一般均为一年）。因此，“施工时间不长，工人流动性较大”应该是祖国恢复阶段的情况，而不是大规模建设开始后的情况。
    其次，合作社既然是由社员自己集股成立的群众性的经济组织；而消费合作社又以工人、职员……等为主要对象。那么，广大建筑工人希望成立自己的消费合作社，以解决工地物资供应的困难，这也是十分正当的要求。发展组织和“只是满足社员群众的供销要求”不仅不矛盾，而且是一致的；也只有首先发展了组织，才可以实现“为社员服务”的业务方针。
    第三，也还有人认为：“工程结束时，社员总是要退社。根据社章的规定，自动退社的社员不得分红，不得退入社手续费（二千元）。这会引起社员的不满意。”事实并不是这样。据北京市新市区联合消费合作社的统计，一九五一年该社在两千名建筑工人社员中，冬季歇工时退社的约占四分之一；而一九五二年，在八千多建筑工人社员中，冬季歇工时退社的仅有一百五十人。这不仅说明了工人要求退社的人很少，同时也可以看出工人的流动性并不是很大的。
    当然，合作社究竟应否在建筑工人中发展组织和应否在基本建设工地设立机构，这是一个原则性的大问题。建筑工人的要求是明确的，北京市做法也是有成绩的，全国合作总社究竟应该怎样来对待这一问题呢？希望读者进行研究，提出意见，更希望合作总社根据北京新市区联合消费合作社的经验加以研究，并提出意见。
