Northwest Geological Personnel Deeply Explore Deep Mountains and Wilderness to Survey Resources

    The resource exploration work in Northwest China in 1952 concluded last December, and preparations for this year are now being actively planned.

    The Northwest region is vast and rich in mineral resources. To provide the necessary resources for national industrial construction, Northwest geological workers have been conducting underground resource surveys since 1951. In 1952, more than sixty field geological survey and drilling teams throughout the region were distributed in deep mountains and wilderness, conducting geological surveys, drilling, trenching, and pitting for petroleum, coal, limestone, and other non-ferrous and ferrous metals. Some teams traveled throughout the Qinling Mountains to prospect for certain non-ferrous metals, some teams collected limestone samples on mountain ridges as high as six or seven hundred meters, some teams studied the stratum structure of petroleum in the Gobi Desert with temperatures as low as minus twenty degrees Celsius, and other teams, carrying food, stoves, and tents, ventured deep into primitive forests to investigate rare metals.

    Through the efforts of geological workers over the past year, significant achievements have been made in resource exploration throughout the region. For example, in the geological survey of petroleum, the work plan was completed by 107.62 percent by the end of last November, and the exploration well work, which was about twice the workload of 1951, was basically completed. The results of resource exploration confirmed the age of the strata in each work area and initially distinguished the oil storage areas and oil-bearing structures. After drilling, trenching, and pitting, the teams under the Northwest Financial and Economic Commission's Resource Exploration Bureau have generally determined some mining areas that can be exploited, initially calculated the amount of mineral deposits, and discovered some new mineral deposits. For example, the "623" survey team of the bureau, in addition to completing the detailed survey of limestone, ensuring the supply of reserves needed for factory construction, also automatically increased the reconnaissance work by eighty square kilometers, discovered new mineral deposits, and increased the available mineral reserves by approximately 80 million tons. The "621" survey team also discovered a promising deposit of a certain non-ferrous metal in the periphery of the detailed survey area.

    The resource exploration task in the Northwest region in 1953 will be greater than in the past under the principle of "concentrating strength and focusing on exploration." In addition to doubling the amount of petroleum exploration well work compared to 1952, the exploration projects for other resources will increase by one-third compared to 1952, and the total investment in exploration work will increase by 6.8 times compared to 1952. The workload of the field work teams will increase by more than 4.2 times compared to the 1952 plan. Not only will the workload increase, but also the technical quota requirements will be raised. At present, the relevant units are proceeding with manpower and equipment preparations. The Resource Exploration Bureau of the Northwest Financial and Economic Commission has held a drilling technician training class, which is expected to train more than 1,200 drilling technicians within a year. In addition, a technical school is being planned to train more than 500 secondary technical cadres (including geology, surveying, and chemical testing personnel). The Northwest Petroleum Administration is also actively preparing to train more specialized talents and actively allocating and purchasing a large number of specialized equipment. The equipment purchased from domestic sources this year will increase by 60 percent compared to 1952. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 西北地质人员深入深山旷野勘测资源

    西北地质人员深入深山旷野勘测资源
    西北地区一九五二年资源勘测工作，已于去年十二月结束，现正积极筹划今年的各项准备工作。
    西北地区辽阔，矿藏丰富。为给国家工业建设提供必要的资源，西北地质工作人员自一九五一年起就开始进行地下资源的勘测工作。一九五二年全区约有六十多个野外地质勘测与钻探队分布在深山旷野，进行对石油、煤、石灰岩及其他有色金属和黑色金属的地质普查、钻探、槽探及坑探等工作。有的队走遍秦岭山脉普查某些有色金属，有的队在高达六、七百公尺的山岭采集石灰岩样品，有的队在零下二十度气温的戈壁滩中了解石油的地层构造，还有的队驮着食粮、灶具和帐篷，深入原始森林地带调查稀有金属。
    经过地质工作人员一年来的努力，全区资源勘测工作已取得了很大成绩，如石油的地质调查方面，到去年十一月底就完成工作计划百分之一百零七点六二，并基本上完成了约比一九五一年工作量增加一倍的探井工作。资源勘测的结果，证实了各工作区的岩层年代，初步分清了储油区域和油层构造情况。西北财政经济委员会资源勘测局所属各队经过钻探、槽探、坑探等工作后，已大体确定一些可供开采的矿区，初步计算出矿藏量，并发现了一些新的矿床。如该局“六二三”调查队，除完成详查石灰岩的工作计划，保证供应建厂需要的储量以外，并自动增加八十平方公里的踏勘工作，发现了新矿床，增加了可供开采的矿产储备量约八千万吨。“六二一”调查队在详查工作地区外围时，还发现了具有很大希望的某种有色金属的矿床。
    西北区一九五三年资源勘测任务，在“集中力量、重点勘测”的方针下，将比过去增大。除石油探井工作量比一九五二年增加一倍外，其他资源的勘测项目将比一九五二年增加三分之一，勘测工作的总投资则比一九五二年增加六点八倍，野外工作队的工作量和一九五二年计划比较，约增加四点二倍以上。不仅工作量增加，而且技术定额的要求也提高了。目前，各有关单位正着手进行人力和器材的准备工作。西北财政经济委员会资源勘测局已举办了一个钻探技工训练班，预计在一年内训练钻探技术工人一千二百多名，此外并筹设一个技术学校，准备培养五百多名中等技术干部（包括地质、测绘、化验等工作干部）。西北石油管理局也积极准备训练更多的专门人才，并积极调配和购进大批专用器材。今年从国内方面购进的器材就将比一九五二年增加百分之六十。    （新华社）
