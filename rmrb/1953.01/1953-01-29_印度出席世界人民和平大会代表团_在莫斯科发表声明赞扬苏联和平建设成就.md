Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 21st (TASS dispatch): The Indian delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, currently visiting the Soviet Union, held a press conference at the Soviet Peace Committee on January 20th. The delegation consists of representatives from all walks of life in India, including prominent leaders of Indian political parties, members of parliament, writers, journalists, distinguished artists, female leaders of religious circles, leaders of peasant and women's movements, and representatives from the business and legal communities. The delegation stayed in the Soviet Union for twenty-five days.

Dr. Kumarappa, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, read out a statement signed by all members of the delegation at the press conference.

The representatives said: The twenty-five days we spent in the Soviet Union were scheduled entirely according to our own choices. In addition to Moscow, we visited the Georgian Republic and the famous heroic cities named after the two great leaders of the Soviet people - Leningrad and Stalingrad.

During these days, we met with important personnel from various departments of the Soviet government and obtained firsthand information about the things that interested us. We listened to reports from academicians of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, economists, and prominent figures in Soviet cultural circles, and had long, informal conversations with them. We met with religious leaders, heads of commercial and trade organizations, and leaders of trade unions and women.

We met many Soviet citizens from all walks of life, at their workplaces, in their homes, in shops, in theaters, and on the streets.

We saw the development of Soviet industry and visited the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow, the Tractor Factory in Stalingrad, and the Textile Factory in Tbilisi. We spent a whole day with farmers from a collective farm, seeing their living environment and the entire organizational system of the farm.

We saw the world-famous Volga-Don Canal and the subway. New university buildings, new houses, and cultural and recreational facilities are being built everywhere we visited.

We visited churches and places of worship. We also saw many religious works circulating throughout the Soviet Union.

The statement continued: One of the most vivid impressions we all received was that all Soviet people are busy with construction work. Every citizen of the Soviet Union has the right to a reasonably comfortable life.

We were deeply impressed by the vast amount of free facilities available to every Soviet citizen - medical care, education, good entertainment in clubs, cultural and sports facilities, etc. We carefully examined the wage and insurance institutions, which provide for the complete living needs of everyone. The special care that the Soviet Union gives to children deeply touched us.

All of us delegates were particularly interested in the increasingly prosperous lives of Soviet farmers.

The overthrow of feudalism and the move towards collectivization have made enormous progress in agriculture and farmer welfare.

The statement pointed out: The living standards of the Soviet people are constantly improving. The statement emphasized the achievements of the Soviet people in transforming nature.

The statement said: We were very moved by the construction projects in the Soviet Union. Vast marshlands in the past have been drained. Hundreds of thousands of hectares of barren land that had never seen water before have been transformed into rice paddies and lush orchards due to the construction of irrigation systems. Well-planned afforestation not only ensures the supply of a large amount of necessary timber, but also improves climatic conditions and protects crops from being destroyed by dry winds.

The statement pointed out: The unity of the Soviet people made a deep impression on the Indian delegation. The delegation made special mention of the democratic management methods of the institutions they visited and the free criticism of management work made by wall posters.

The final part of the statement emphasized: The Soviet people are eager for peace, and the Soviet construction work aimed at benefiting all the people can only be out of peaceful intentions.

The representatives said: The Soviet people are eager to develop the closest and most friendly relations with us. They want to develop trade and cultural exchanges.

After we return home, we will do our best to widely publicize the true situation of the Soviet Union, which will help the people of our two countries to unite more and more closely, so that we can work together more for the noble cause of world peace.

After reading the statement, the members of the delegation answered many questions from press representatives, which proved that the Soviet people showed great interest in the lives of the Indian people.

    印度出席世界人民和平大会代表团
    在莫斯科发表声明赞扬苏联和平建设成就
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日电：现在访问苏联的印度出席世界人民和平大会代表团，于一月二十日在苏联拥护和平委员会举行记者招待会。代表团由印度各阶层人士的代表们组成，其中包括印度各政党的著名领袖、国会议员、作家、记者、卓越的艺术家、宗教界的女领袖、农民和妇女运动的领袖以及商界和律师的代表。代表团在苏联逗留了二十五天。
    全印和平理事会副主席库马拉帕博士，在记者招待会上宣读了由代表团全体团员签字的一篇声明。
    代表们说：我们在苏联度过的二十五天，日程完全是我们自己选择的。除了莫斯科以外，我们曾经访问格鲁吉亚共和国以及以苏联人民的两位伟大领袖命名的著名的英雄城市——列宁格勒和斯大林格勒。
    在这些天内，我们会见了苏联政府各部门的重要人员，并从他们那里得到了关于我们感兴趣的事物的第一手材料。我们曾经听过苏联科学院院士、经济学家和苏联文化界名流的报告，并和他们作过长时间的不拘形式的谈话。我们曾经会见宗教界的领袖、商业贸易团体的负责人以及工会和妇女领袖。
    我们曾经会见各行各业的许多苏联公民，在他们工作的地方，在他们家里，在商店里，在剧院里，在大街上会见过他们。
    我们看到苏联工业的发达，访问过莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂、斯大林格勒的拖拉机工厂和第比利斯的纺织工厂。我们曾和一个集体农庄的农民一起度过一整天，看到他们的生活环境和整个农庄的组织制度。
    我们曾经看到闻名世界的伏尔加河—顿河运河和地下铁道。新的大学建筑物、新房屋和文化娱乐场所正在我们所参观的每一个地方建筑起来。
    我们曾经参观教堂和做礼拜的地方。我们还看到在苏联全国流行的许多份宗教著作。
    声明接着说：我们全体团员所得到的一个最鲜明的印象，就是全体苏联人民都在忙于建设工作。苏联的每一个公民都有权利过相当舒适的生活。
    关于每一个苏联公民可以享受大量免费设备——医疗、教育、俱乐部内良好的娱乐、文化和体育设备等，我们得到了深刻的印象。我们曾经仔细考察工资和保险机构，这些机构供给每一个人的全部生活需要。苏联对儿童的特别关怀，使我们受到深切的感动。
    我们全体代表们特别感到兴趣的是苏联农民们一天比一天富裕的生活。
    封建制度的推翻和走向集体化使农业和农民福利方面有了巨大的进展。
    声明指出：苏联人民的生活水准正在不断提高。声明中着重指出苏联人民在改造自然方面所获得的成就。
    声明中说：苏联的建设工程使我们非常感动。过去的广大沼泽地带已经把水排除。以前简直没有见过水的几十万公顷焦枯的土地，由于建筑了灌溉系统，变成了稻田和繁茂的果园。计划周密的造林工作，不但保证了大量必需种类木材的供应，同时也改良了气候条件，并使作物不受旱风的摧毁。
    声明指出：苏联人民的团结使印度代表团得到一种深刻的印象。代表团特别提到他们所参观的机构的民主管理方法以及墙报对管理工作提出的自由批评。
    声明的最后一部分强调说：苏联人民热望和平，旨在为全体人民造福的苏联的建设工作只可能是出于和平的意图。
    代表们说：苏联人民渴望发展和我们的最亲密最友好的关系。他们想发展贸易和文化的交流。
    在我们回国以后，我们将尽力广泛宣传苏联的实况，这种实况将帮助我们两国人民越来越紧密地团结在一起，俾使我们可以一起更多地为世界和平的崇高事业而努力。
    在宣读了这篇声明后，代表团团员们答复了报界代表的许多问题，这些问题证明苏联人民对印度人民的生活表示极大的兴趣。
