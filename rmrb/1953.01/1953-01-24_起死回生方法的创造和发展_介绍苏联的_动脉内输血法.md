    The Creation and Development of Resuscitation Methods
    ——Introducing the Soviet "Intra-Arterial Transfusion Method"
    Ge Shaolong
    When warm-blooded animals (including humans) lose too much blood or their hearts stop functioning due to other diseases, it signifies the death of life. How to restore the contraction and relaxation function of a heart that has stopped, that is, how to "bring the dead back to life," is one of the most important issues in life and also one of the most scientifically challenging problems. In the Soviet Union, this problem has been successfully solved. This is the use of the "intra-arterial transfusion method" to restore vitality to dying or recently deceased patients whose hearts have stopped functioning and breathing has ceased due to severe blood loss.
    The Soviet "intra-arterial transfusion method" began its experiments in 1939. At that time, Dr. Birillo applied the "intra-arterial transfusion method" to five dying patients, which temporarily brought them out of the state of dying, but they still died after four to twenty-three hours. This was the initial attempt of the "intra-arterial transfusion method." During World War II, many Red Army soldiers who were dying or had recently died from severe blood loss were rescued after being treated with the "intra-arterial transfusion method." This was not only a great achievement in the Soviet medical field but also a very important advancement in world science.
    The first scientist to theoretically prove the "resurrection" effect of the "intra-arterial transfusion method" on biological individuals who are dying or have died shortly after due to severe blood loss was Professor Negovsky of the Soviet Union. At the same time, he also determined the necessary conditions for the "intra-arterial transfusion method" to restore heart activity. In 1943, Professor Negovsky wrote a very important paper on his experimental results: "The Restoration of the Life Functions of Biological Individuals in a State of Dying and Clinical Death." After World War II, scientific journals in capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States also translated and published this paper for research.
    According to Professor Negovsky, the stage of death should be divided into two: the stage of dying and the stage of clinical death. The state of dying is the final struggle before death, which is the struggle of a biological individual to preserve life when it is dying but not yet dead; the state of clinical death is the state in which the cardiopulmonary activity of a biological individual has stopped but has not yet reached biological death. In the stage of biological death, the most important organs of life have undergone irreversible pathological changes, and it is impossible to rescue them.
    Obviously, from the point of view of "bringing the dead back to life," it is easier to be effective if rescue methods are implemented in the state of dying than in the stage of clinical death. In order to study the possibility of the effectiveness of "resurrection" methods, a thorough study must be conducted on each stage from the state of dying through the state of clinical death to the final true death.
    Professor Negovsky conducted in-depth research on this issue from 1936 to 1942. He determined that a truly effective "resurrection" method must be implemented within five to six minutes after the occurrence of clinical death. His method is the combination of "intra-arterial transfusion method" and artificial respiration.
    During the six years, he used 250 dogs to conduct "resurrection" experiments: blood was released from the femoral artery (the artery on the thigh that can be felt pulsating). After the blood flowed out too much and the animal fell into a state of clinical death (that is, the state where the heart and lungs have stopped functioning) within five to eight minutes, the "intra-arterial transfusion method" was implemented. Dogs that could not be rescued were dissected and examined with a pathological microscope, and dogs that were fortunately regenerated were also subjected to all necessary biochemical examinations.
    Professor Negovsky's research reached the following important conclusions:
    First, if the "intra-arterial transfusion method" is implemented six minutes after an animal falls into a state of clinical death, it cannot be revived. From the results of microscopic examination, after an animal falls into clinical death, after a relatively long period of time (six to twenty minutes), the nerve cells of the central nervous system, that is, the nerve cells in the brain, cerebellum, spinal cord, and other parts, cannot obtain the nutrition of blood for a long time, and they lose their normal healthy state; they are damaged and die. The central nervous system nerve cells are the highest organization that dominates the activities of various organs of the animal body, that is, the most important organization for maintaining animal life. Therefore, the death of the central nervous system nerve cells means the cessation of the activities of various organs of the whole body. At this time, the animal cannot have any hope of revival.
    Second, after an animal's heart activity and breathing have stopped due to bleeding, if the "intra-arterial transfusion method" is implemented within no more than five to six minutes, then the animal's heart will resume activity and breathing will begin again. That is to say, the animal will definitely be revived. Conversely, if the "intra-arterial transfusion method" is started six minutes after the state of clinical death, the experimental results show that only one dog was rescued, and the rest died. The experimental results of 250 dogs are consistent with the results of microscopic examination after the death of animals, that is to say, after six minutes of clinical death in animals, the nerve cells of the central nervous system have died, and the animals have lost hope of revival. This experimental result shows that animals (including humans) whose heart activity and breathing have stopped must be treated with the "intra-arterial transfusion method" within five to six minutes, otherwise there is no hope of revival.
    Intravenous transfusion takes a long time for the blood to reach the central nervous system, while the "intra-arterial transfusion method" can quickly transport the blood to the central nervous system; therefore, to save the life of an animal, the "intra-arterial transfusion method" must be used.
    This is the conclusion that Professor Negovsky obtained from his research and the "resurrection" method he discovered.
    In recent years, the Soviet medical community has conducted further research on the "intra-arterial transfusion method."
    First of all, the Soviet medical community has made a step forward in the theoretical research on the "intra-arterial transfusion method." Previously, it was only believed that the activity of the heart depended entirely on the nutrition of the blood in the coronary arteries (cardiac coronary arteries) of the heart itself. After a large loss of blood, there is a lack of blood in the cardiac coronary arteries, and the heart muscle itself loses the necessary nutrition and loses the ability to contract and relax and stops functioning. This is the state of clinical death. After the implementation of "intra-arterial transfusion," the cardiac coronary arteries quickly receive blood, and the heart muscle itself obtains the necessary nutrition, and the activity of the heart will recover.
    In April 1951, two Soviet doctors, Medvedeva and Brus, published their research results, proving the correctness of the theory of the Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov from the effective process of the "intra-arterial transfusion method."
    Pavlov's theory believes that the central nervous system is the highest organization that dominates various organs of the whole body, and the heart is also under its control. The so-called "vagus nerve" starting from a part of the brain has a close relationship with heart activity. The experiments of the two doctors Medvedeva and Brus proved the following facts: if the blood of an animal (dog) is released and its "vagus nerve" is cut off, then even if the "intra-arterial transfusion method" is implemented, the animal's heart, which has stopped functioning, will not function again, that is to say, the animal cannot be revived. Conversely, if the "vagus nerve" is not cut off, the "intra-arterial transfusion method" will restore the heart's activity and revive the animal. This research result developed the "intra-arterial transfusion method" in theory. And the correctness of Pavlov's theory has gained another proof.
    In terms of clinical practice, the application scope of the "intra-arterial transfusion method" has also gradually expanded. The Soviet medical community is applying the "intra-arterial transfusion method" to adults as well as children as much as possible. Here is an example to illustrate. Dr. Konstantinov published an experimental report in the November 1952 issue of "Soviet Medicine," saying that fourteen children (the youngest of whom was only a four-month-old girl, and the rest were children between the ages of two and eleven) were treated with the "intra-arterial transfusion method," and ten of them obtained hope of revival from a state of dying or shortly after death. This achievement is amazing.
    The above information proves that the "intra-arterial transfusion method" does have the effect of "bringing the dead back to life." This is a remarkable success in the Soviet medical community. This success precisely illustrates the greatness of the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of Soviet medicine and the superiority of the socialist system.

    起死回生方法的创造和发展
    ——介绍苏联的“动脉内输血法”
    戈绍龙
    温血动物（包括人类在内）在失血过多或因其他疾病而心脏停止活动时，就意味着生命的死亡。如何使已停止活动的心脏再恢复收缩和舒张的机能，就是说，如何“起死回生”，乃是生命上一个最重要的问题，同时也是科学上一个最使人感到棘手的问题。在苏联，已成功地解决了这一问题。这就是用“动脉内输血法”，使因重伤出血而心脏停止活动和呼吸停止的濒死病人或死去不久的病人恢复生命力。
    苏联的“动脉内输血法”的试验，始于一九三九年。那时彼立洛医师曾在五名濒死的病人身上应用了“动脉内输血法”，使病人都暂时脱离了濒死的状态，但在四至二十三小时以后，依然死亡。这是“动脉内输血法”的最初尝试。在第二次世界大战期间，许多因重伤出血而濒死或死去不久的红军战士，经用“动脉内输血法”处置后，大多数被救活了。这不仅是苏联医学界的一个伟大成就，而且是世界科学上一个很重要的进步。
    第一个从学理上证明“动脉内输血法”对于因重伤失血而濒死的或死后不久的生物个体具有“起死回生”效力的科学家，是苏联的涅戈夫斯基教授。同时他也确定了“动脉内输血法”恢复心脏活动的必要条件。一九四三年涅戈夫斯基教授把他的实验结果写成了一篇极为重要的论文：“濒死状态下及临床性死亡状态下生物个体生命机能的恢复”。在第二次大战以后，英美等资本主义国家的科学杂志也纷纷译载了这篇论文，进行研究。
    按照涅戈夫斯基教授的说明，死亡的阶段应该分为两个：一个是濒死状态的阶段，一个是临床性死亡状态的阶段。濒死状态就是临死时的最后挣扎，这是生物个体将死未死时为保存生命而作的斗争；临床性死亡状态是生物个体的心肺活动已经停止而尚未达到生物性死亡的状态。到了生物性死亡时期，生命最重要的脏器发生了不可恢复的病态，那就无法救助了。
    很显然，从“起死回生”的观点而言，如果在濒死状态下施行救助方法，比在临床性死亡阶段更容易奏效。为了研究“起死回生”方法奏效的可能性，必须对于从濒死状态经过临床性死亡状态到最后真正死亡的各阶段，进行彻底的研究。
    涅戈夫斯基氏在一九三六年至一九四二年的六年间，曾对这个问题进行了深刻的研究，他断定：真正有效的“起死回生”的方法，必须在临床性死亡状态发生后的五至六分钟以内施行。他的方法就是“动脉内输血法”和人工呼吸法的并用。
    他在六年间，用二百五十只狗做了“起死回生”的实验：从狗的股动脉（大腿上可触知跳动的动脉）把血放出去。在血液流得过多，动物陷于临床性死亡状态（即心脏和肺都停止活动的状态）以后的第五乃至第八分钟以内，施行“动脉内输血法”。凡不能获救的狗，即予解剖，并用病理学显微镜加以检查，幸而能再生的狗，也加以种种必要的生物化学检查。
    涅戈夫斯基教授的研究达到了如下的重要结论：
    第一，动物在陷于临床性死亡状态以后六分钟，如果施行“动脉内输血法”，就不能复生。从显微镜检查的结果来看，在动物陷于临床性死亡以后，经过较长时间（六至二十分钟），中枢神经系统的神经细胞，即大脑、小脑、脊髓等等部位的神经细胞，因为在较长的时间内不能获得血液的营养，都失去了正常的健康状态；它们受到破坏，死亡了。中枢神经细胞是主宰动物全身各脏器活动的最高组织，也就是维持动物生命最重要的组织，因此，中枢神经系统神经细胞的死亡，就意味着全身各脏器活动的停止。这时，动物就不可能有复活的希望。
    第二，在动物因出血而心脏活动及呼吸都停止以后，如果在不超过五至六分钟以内即施行“动脉内输血法”，那末，动物的心脏又会重新活动，呼吸也会重新开始。这就是说，动物是一定会复活的。相反地，如果在临床性死亡状态以后经过六分钟才开始“动脉内输血法”，试验结果表明，只有一只狗获救，其余的狗都死亡了。两百五十只狗的实验结果，正和动物死后显微镜检查的结果相符合，就是说，动物在临床性死亡以后经过六分钟，中枢神经系统的神经细胞都已死亡，动物就失去复活的希望。这个试验结果说明了，心脏活动和呼吸均已停止的动物（包括人类在内），必须在五至六分钟以内施行“动脉内输血法”，否则就无复活的希望。
    从静脉内输血，血液达到中枢神经系的过程很慢，而“动脉内输血法”却能很快地把血液输送到中枢神经系；所以要挽救动物的生命，必须应用“动脉内输血法”。
    这就是涅戈夫斯基教授从研究中所得的结论及其所发见的“起死回生”方法。
    最近几年，苏联医学界对“动脉内输血法”作了进一步的研究。
    首先，苏联医学界在关于“动脉内输血法”的理论研究方面前进了一步。以前只是认为，心脏的活动，全靠心脏本身的冠状动脉（心冠状动脉）血液的营养。在大失血以后，心冠状动脉内血液缺乏，心脏本身的肌肉因失去了必要的营养，即丧失收缩和舒张的能力而停止活动。这就是临床性死亡的状态。在施行“动脉内输血”以后，心冠状动脉很快地接受血液，心脏本身的肌肉因获得必要的营养，心脏的活动会恢复。
    一九五一年四月，苏联梅德维德娃和勃鲁斯两医师发表了他们的研究成绩，从“动脉内输血法”的奏效过程，证明了苏联生理学家伊凡·巴夫洛夫学说的正确。
    巴夫洛夫学说认为，中枢神经系统是支配全身各脏器的最高组织，心脏也同样受着它的支配。从脑的一部分出发的所谓“迷走神经”，和心脏活动有着密切的关系。梅德维德娃和勃鲁斯两医师的实验证明了如下的事实：如果把动物（狗）的血放出，并截断其“迷走神经”，则虽实行“动脉内输血法”，动物的已停止活动的心脏也不会再活动，就是说，动物不能复活。相反地，如果“迷走神经”未被截断，“动脉内输血法”就会使心脏恢复活动，使动物复活。这个研究结果，从学理上发展了“动脉内输血法”。而巴夫洛夫学说的正确性，又获得了一个证明。
    在临床方面，“动脉内输血法”的应用范围也逐渐扩大了。苏联医学界不但对成人，而且对小孩尽可能地应用着“动脉内输血法”。这里举一个例子来说明。孔丝唐第诺娃医师在一九五二年十一月号“苏联医学”杂志上发表了一篇实验报告，说十四名小孩（其中最小的一名不过是生后四个月的女孩，其余都是两岁至十一岁的小孩）经过“动脉内输血法”的处置，十名从濒死状态或死后不久的状态获得复活的希望。这个成绩是令人惊异的。
    以上的资料，证明了“动脉内输血法”确有“起死回生”的效力。这是苏联医学界的一个卓越的成功。这个成功正说明了苏联医学的革命人道主义精神的伟大和社会主义制度的优越性。
