Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 24th: From January 16th to 20th, the Korean-Chinese People's Forces conducted small-scale assault and interdiction operations in several locations on the eastern, central, and western fronts.

　　On the eastern front, our forces simultaneously attacked two U.S. military positions southeast of Shatali, near Mundong, on the night of the 18th. The enemy on one of the high grounds, fearing annihilation, had already fled in panic when our troops approached; on another mountain, over 800 meters high, a group of enemy soldiers did not have time to escape and were completely annihilated by our forces in a fifteen-minute battle. The enemy, who rushed to reinforce them, also suffered casualties from our forces. Our forces annihilated more than ninety U.S. soldiers in total. In addition, our forces annihilated more than fifty soldiers of the Li pseudo-army in two assault operations on the 16th and 17th on the eastern front.

　　On the western front, our forces captured a forward post of the Li pseudo-army in the Guihu Cave area northwest of Lianchuan, annihilating more than twenty enemy soldiers.

　　On the central front, our forces won a victory in the battle to attack an enemy position near Fangpingli, southeast of Jincheon. Our forces captured the enemy position in one fell swoop and completely annihilated a platoon of the Li pseudo-army. Our troops on the mountain range to the left of Shangganling, north of Jinhua, repelled two attacks by the Li pseudo-army at noon on the 18th and in the early morning of the 19th. Our infantry and artillery killed and wounded more than one hundred enemy soldiers in total.

　　Fierce artillery battles took place in many places on the front lines. The enemy artillery blindly bombarded our positions day after day, firing an average of more than 33,000 shells per day. Our forces relied on solid tunnel fortifications to cope with the enemy's artillery fire and used mobile artillery fire to strike the enemy. Although the number of shells fired by our forces was less than one-tenth of the enemy's, our forces used accurate shooting to kill and wound more than 400 enemy soldiers in these five days.

　　In these five days, our front-line anti-aircraft artillery shot down twelve enemy planes and damaged seven.

    朝中人民部队在前线进行袭击战和阻击战
    五天中我高射火器击落敌机十二架、击伤敌机七架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】一月十六日到二十日朝中人民部队在东线、中线和西线的几个地方进行了小规模的袭击战和阻击战。
    东线我军在十八日夜里同时袭击文登东南沙汰里附近的两个美军阵地。其中一个高地上的敌人害怕被歼灭，在我军进到那里时他们已经慌忙逃跑了；在另一个八百多公尺高的山地上，一股敌人来不及逃跑，就在十五分钟的战斗中被我军全部歼灭。当时仓忙赶来增援的敌人，也遭到了我军的杀伤。我军先后共计歼灭美军九十多名。另外，东线我军还在十六、十七两日的两次袭击战中，歼灭了李伪军五十多名。
    西线我军在涟川西北桂湖洞地区攻下李伪军的一个前哨阵地，歼灭敌人二十多名。
    中线我军在袭击金城东南芳坪里附近敌军阵地的战斗中获得了胜利。我军一举攻下了敌军阵地，全部歼灭李伪军一个排。金化以北上甘岭左边山岭上的我军，在十八日中午和十九日早晨，击退了李伪军两次进攻。我军步兵和炮兵共杀伤敌军一百多名。
    在前线许多地方发生猛烈的炮战。敌军炮兵连日向我军阵地盲目轰击，平均每天发炮三万三千多发。我军依托巩固的坑道工事对付了敌人的炮火，并且用游动炮火打击敌人。虽然我军发射的炮弹数目不到敌人的十分之一，但我军在这五天中用准确的射击，打死打伤的敌军有四百多名。
    在这五天中我军前线高射火器共击落敌机十二架，击伤敌机七架。
