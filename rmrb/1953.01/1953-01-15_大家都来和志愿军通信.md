    Everyone Communicate with the Volunteer Army
    Editor's Note: In the "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue" No. 104, published on January 4th of this year, Comrade Ji Guangzhong's suggestion on "Please Everyone Communicate More with Volunteer Army Comrades" was published. This suggestion has already gained the attention and support of the broad masses of people. In recent days, we have received some letters reporting to the Volunteer Army on the construction of the motherland and their work, study, and life; at the same time, we have also received many letters from the Volunteer Army reporting to the people of the motherland on their victory news and their heroic deeds. These letters undoubtedly have a great promotional effect on encouraging the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the motherland, stimulating the people's enthusiasm for work, production, and learning, and further inspiring the Volunteer Army's confidence in defending the country, killing the enemy, and making meritorious service. Now we are publishing three letters from Comrades Cui Xianjiang and others. We hope that the vast number of readers will more actively communicate with the most beloved people.

    大家都来和志愿军通信
    编者按：今年一月四日第一○四期的“抗美援朝专刊”上，刊登了季光中同志关于“请大家更多地和志愿军同志通信”的建议。这一建议已经获得广大人民群众的重视和拥护。日来我们已经收到一部分向志愿军报告祖国建设和自己的工作、学习、生活等情况的信；同时也收到很多志愿军向祖国人民报告胜利消息和他们的英雄事迹的信。这些信，对于鼓舞祖国人民的爱国热情、激发人民的工作、生产和学习的积极性，以及更加振奋志愿军保家卫国杀敌立功的信心，无疑地是有很大的推动作用的。现在我们选登崔鲜疆等同志的三封信。希望广大读者更加踊跃地来和最可爱的人通信。
