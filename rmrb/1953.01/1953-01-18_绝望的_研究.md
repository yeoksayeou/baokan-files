    Desperate "Research"
  　Fu Zhen
    In the past, someone composed a couplet for the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield, which read:
    "You hate your troops for being weak when you need them;
    You don't know how difficult the battle is until you've fought it!"
    That's exactly the case. The American aggressors have deeply experienced how "difficult" the "battle" is, and therefore they "hate" their own troops' "weakness" even more. However, "knowing the difficulty" does not equal regretting the disaster; the American aggressors are still continuing the war. Battles require soldiers, so the American aggressors repeatedly focus on their own "weak" soldiers, attempting to use some method to make their weak soldiers stronger and raise their morale. However, everything is in vain. "Free trips" and "high salaries" cannot increase the bravery of soldiers; "rotation systems" and "blonde, blue-eyed girls" cannot raise morale; even "bulletproof armor" cannot guarantee the safety of soldiers' lives. The American military's combat effectiveness is getting weaker and weaker, and morale is getting lower and lower.

    On the issue of how to improve morale, the American aggressors are already "at their wit's end." In desperation, they even fantasize about begging help from "scientists" and tape recorders. According to a United Press dispatch from the Korean front: America's "four scientists on Sunday (January 11th) climbed the rugged mountain peaks of the front line with books and tape recorders to find out why the soldiers were complaining." These four scientists are "three psychologists and one sociologist." According to the team leader, Rodney Clark, "This is the first time the military has studied the psychology of combat infantry in detail," and they will "work with the latest psychological testing methods." Currently, the psychology of the American soldiers on the Korean battlefield is very clear: they abhor this war of sacrificing their own lives to exchange for the highest profits for the Wall Street bosses. A U.S. Army chaplain at the Korean front said, "What the soldiers got in 1952 was pain, despair, and disappointment. They watched their comrades get killed or maimed. ...Based on past combat experience, they know that future battles will bring more death, more destruction, and more despair." The words of this army chaplain are in line with the actual situation; the American soldiers' hearts are so dejected.

    If the American scientists are not burying their heads in the sand after their "research" and "testing," then it is certain that the conclusions they can write will not be any more optimistic than what the chaplain said. Because any beautiful words can never replace stubborn facts, and this is absolutely no exception for the American aggressors.

    In the past, American medical scientists could not cure the "startle disease" of American soldiers. Now, American scientists can never cure the war-weariness of American soldiers. This can be completely determined without "research" and "testing."

    绝望的“研究”
  　傅真
    过去，曾经有人给朝鲜战场上的美国侵略者编了一付对联，叫做：
    “兵到用时方恨弱；
    仗非打过不知难！”
    事情也正是这样，美国侵略者已经深深体验到“仗”的“难”打，因而也更加痛“恨”自己的兵“弱”。不过，“知难”并不等于悔祸，美国侵略者仍然在继续进行战争。仗要兵打，所以，美国侵略者便一再在它自己的“弱”兵身上打主意，企图用一种什么方法，使它的弱兵强起来，使它的士气高起来。可是，一切都是徒然的。“免费旅行”、“高额薪金”，增加不了士兵的勇敢，“轮换制”、“金发碧眼女郎”也提高不了士气，甚至，“避弹的铠甲”同样无法保障士兵生命的安全。美军的战斗力是越来越弱，士气是越来越低了。
    在如何提高士气的问题上，美国侵略者已经是“黔驴技穷”了。他们在绝望中竟异想天开地乞灵于“科学家”和录音器。据美国合众社自朝鲜前线报道：美国的“四个科学家星期日（一月十一日）背着书本和录音器，爬上崎岖的前线山头，要去找出战士们发牢骚的原因。”这四个科学家是“三个心理学家和一个社会学家”。据领队的罗德奈·克拉克说：“这是军方第一次详细地研究作战步兵的心理”，他们将“用最新的心理测验方法工作”。现在，朝鲜战场上美军士兵的心理，是很清楚的，就是厌恶这种牺牲自己性命而为华尔街老板换取最高利润的战争。在朝鲜前线的一个美军军队牧师说：“战士们在一九五二年所得到的是痛苦、绝望和失望。他们眼看着伙伴们被击毙或者被打成残废。……根据过去的战斗经验，他们都知道将来的战斗还要有更多的死亡、更多的破坏和更多的绝望。”这个军队牧师的话是符合实际情况的，美军士兵的心里就是这样颓丧。
    美国科学家们经过“研究”、“测验”之后，如果不是掩耳盗铃，那么，可以肯定：他们所能写出的结论决不会比那个牧师所说的稍许乐观一些。因为，任何好看的文字绝对代替不了顽强的事实，这一点，对美国侵略者是绝不会例外的。
    过去，美国的医学家医治不了美国士兵的“吃惊病”，现在，美国科学家也决不能医治美国士兵的厌战病，这是无庸“研究”和“测验”就完全可以断定的。
