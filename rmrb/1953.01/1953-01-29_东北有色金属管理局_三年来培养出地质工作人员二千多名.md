Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau

In the past three years, the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau has trained more than 2,100 geological workers, the most needed personnel in the country. This includes 1,900 drilling machine technicians, 125 drilling technicians, and 112 geological survey and mining personnel. These technical talents have played a significant role in their work. For example, the drilling company under the bureau completed a drilling workload in September last year that was 163 times the monthly workload three years prior. The Qingyuan Geological Survey Team, composed of 14 newly trained personnel, conducted a mining geological survey of more than 1,400 square kilometers last spring. This new technical force has not only strengthened the geological survey and drilling organizations at all levels of the bureau, but also transferred more than 840 geological exploration personnel to work in mines in North China, Southwest China and other regions.

The bureau's work in training geological talents started from a weak base of only fourteen drilling machine technicians and six geological survey personnel. The method they adopted was to train people batch by batch while working, teaching, and learning. The first batch of drilling team trainees consisted of 200 outstanding administrative cadres and workers selected from various mines, and the first batch of geological survey team trainees consisted of 21 cadres and students with high school or higher education. The teaching materials they used were compiled by experienced drilling machine technicians and geological survey personnel based on their work experience, combined with technical theory. Therefore, after six months of study, the trainees were able to master general drilling and survey techniques.

In order to further improve the technical level of drilling machine technicians, the bureau also held short-term training courses, rotating training for experienced drilling technicians and newly trained machine chiefs and team leaders, and invited Soviet experts or technicians to teach them advanced drilling technology theory and experience. After completing the training, these trainees went to the field to teach and promote. Through the study of training courses and the improvement in work, the bureau now has one hundred and twenty-five experienced drilling technicians and newly trained machine chiefs and team leaders who have become technical personnel capable of designing drilling projects.

In the training of geological survey personnel, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient students with high school or higher education, the bureau absorbed workers and students with junior high school and higher elementary school education from various mines to form twelve ore vein investigation teams, and the technical personnel of the bureau's geological survey team were responsible for training them into elementary geological survey personnel capable of surveying ore veins. When these people improved their technical theory and survey experience in their work, they were absorbed as trainees of the geological survey team for further training. At present, some of the members of the ore vein investigation team have been absorbed as trainees of the geological survey team. (Xinhua News Agency)

    三年来培养出地质工作人员二千多名
    东北有色金属管理局三年来已培养出全国最感缺乏的地质工作人员二千一百多个。其中包括钻探机技术工人一千九百个，钻探技术人员一百二十五个，地质勘测、采矿人员一百十二个。这些技术人材已在工作中发挥了很大的作用。如该局钻探公司去年九月份所作的钻探工作量，就等于三年前一个月工作量的一百六十三倍。由十四个新培养人员组成的清源地质勘测大队，曾在去年春季作了一千四百多平方公里的矿山地质普查工作。这批新生的技术力量，不但壮大了该局各级地质勘测、钻探的机构，而且已有八百四十多个地质勘探人员输送到华北、西南等区的矿山进行工作。
    该局培养地质人材的工作，是在只有十四个钻探机技术工人和六个地质勘测人员的薄弱基础上开始的。他们采取的办法是在工作中用“边作、边教、边学”的方式逐批地培养。第一批钻探队的学员是从各矿山选拔的二百个优秀的行政干部和工人，第一批地质勘测队的学员是二十一个高中以上程度的干部和学生。他们所用的教材是钻探机老技术工人和地质勘测人员根据工作经验，配合技术理论编成的。所以学员们经过六个月的学习，就能掌握一般的钻探和勘测技术。
    为了进一步提高钻探机技术工人的技术水平，该局又举办了短期训练班，轮训钻探老技术工人和新培养出来的机长、班长，请苏联专家或技术人员为他们讲授先进的钻探技术理论和经验。这批学员学习完后，就分头到现场传授和推广。经过训练班的学习和在工作中的提高，现该局已有一百二十五个钻探老技术工人和新培养的机长、班长成为能够设计钻探工程的技术人员。
    该局在地质勘测人员的培养工作中，为克服高中以上程度学生不足的困难，曾在各矿山吸收初中和高小程度的工人、学生组成十二个矿苗调查队，由该局地质勘测队的技术人员负责把他们培养成能勘测矿苗的初级地质勘测人员。当这些人在工作中提高了技术理论和勘测经验时，就吸收为地质勘测队的学员，继续加以培养。目前，矿苗调查队的队员中已有一部分人员被吸收为地质勘测队学员。（新华社）
