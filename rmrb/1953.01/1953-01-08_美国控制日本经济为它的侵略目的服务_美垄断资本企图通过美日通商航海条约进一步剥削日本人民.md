Xinhua News Agency, 6th. TASS Moscow Dispatch: Nikolsky published an article in the "Red Star" on the 4th entitled "The Japanese Economy in the Hands of American Aggressors," commenting on the American imperialist control of the Japanese economy and the use of the Japanese economy to serve aggressive purposes. He wrote that almost all major Japanese companies are now controlled by American monopoly capitalists. After seizing an important position in the Japanese economy, the United States made it serve American aggressive purposes. Disregarding the national interests of the Japanese people and violating the resolutions of the Potsdam Conference, the United States is pursuing a policy of transforming Japanese industry into its "arsenal" and an appendage of the American wartime economy. Nikolsky further pointed out that the submission of the Japanese economy to American capital and its transformation into an American arsenal were carried out with the consent of the Japanese ruling clique because the Japanese ruling clique has colluded with American imperialism.

Nikolsky said that the U.S. monopoly capital's militarization policy has determined the abnormal and one-sided development of the Japanese economy. Seventy percent of Japan's budget is used for war purposes. Therefore, Japanese civilian industries are encountering a serious crisis. In the eight months of 1952, 9,600 Japanese enterprises went bankrupt. Nearly 10 million people nationwide are unemployed or partially unemployed. Washington's ban on trade between Japan and China is most harmful to the Japanese economy because, for Japan, trade with China is essential.

Nikolsky pointed out that the American monopoly capitalists' predatory policies have aroused growing dissatisfaction in Japan and deepened the contradictions between Japan and the United States. Not only the working people but also a considerable part of the Japanese bourgeoisie—mainly the middle and petty bourgeoisie—oppose American bullying. The Japanese business community is opposing the restrictions imposed by the United States on trade with China. The serious economic contradictions between Japan and the United States are manifested in the negotiations on trade agreements between Japan and the United States. "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that in this negotiation, Japan opposed the U.S. demand that the treaty stipulate that American capital have unrestricted freedom of action in Japan, and Japan stated that it would protect its industry and foreign trade.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tokyo News: The draft of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which the Japanese Yoshida government and the U.S. government began negotiating in February 1952, has been completed. This treaty is a supplement to the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" with Japan. U.S. monopoly capital will use this treaty to control the Japanese economy without restriction and further exploit the Japanese people.

According to Kyodo News Agency, the "template" of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is the U.S.-Colombia "Friendship" Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. As everyone knows, Colombia is a Latin American country controlled by Wall Street and devoid of any independent spirit. The United States insisted on using the U.S.-Colombia Treaty as the blueprint for the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in the negotiation process, and its purpose was to completely abolish Japan's economic sovereignty and make Japan a more thorough American colony. Kyodo News Agency said: "One noticeable point of the new U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is that the 'nationalistic color' in the old treaty (referring to the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation concluded in 1911) has been swept away." According to the new treaty, Americans in Japan will enjoy the same rights as Japanese, which is the so-called national treatment. According to "Mainichi Shimbun," the new U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation relaxes Japan's current "Foreign Investment Law" and "allows American individuals or companies to purchase controlling shares of Japanese companies." According to official Japanese statistics, since the implementation of the "Foreign Investment Law" in June 1950, as of the end of November 1952, foreigners have held 100,838,800 shares of Japanese enterprises, worth 8,679.9 million yen. It is conceivable that the implementation of the new treaty will enable the power of American capital to infiltrate the Japanese economy without restriction, further manipulating all of Japan's industry, trade, and shipping. The new treaty also stipulates that the American side can remit the profits exploited from Japan back to its own country, and the Japanese government will not impose any restrictions. There is no doubt that this unequal treaty will be opposed by the Japanese people.

    美国控制日本经济为它的侵略目的服务
    美垄断资本企图通过美日通商航海条约进一步剥削日本人民
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：尼科尔斯基在四日的“红星报”发表一篇文章——“在美国侵略者掌握中的日本经济”，评论美帝国主义对于日本经济的控制和利用日本经济服务于侵略目的的情形。他写道，目前差不多所有日本大公司都被美国垄断资本家控制住了。美国攫夺了日本经济的重要地位以后，就使它服务于美国侵略目的。美国不顾日本人民的民族利益，违背波茨坦会议的决议，奉行着一个变日本工业为它的“兵工厂”、为美国战时经济的附属物的方针。尼科尔斯基进一步指出，日本经济向美国资本屈服并且变为美国的兵工厂都是在日本统治集团的同意之下进行的，因为日本统治集团已和美帝国主义勾结在一起了。
    尼科尔斯基说：美国垄断资本的统治军国主义化政策决定了日本经济的不正常的片面发展。日本预算有百分之七十是用于战争目的的。因此日本民用工业就遭遇到严重的危机。在一九五二年的八个月内，日本企业倒闭的达九千六百家。全国失业和部分失业的近一千万人。华盛顿禁止日本和中国贸易，对日本经济是最有害的，因为对日本说来，对华贸易是十分必要的。
    尼科尔斯基指出：美国垄断资本家的掠夺政策引起了日本日益增长的不满并加深了日、美之间的矛盾。不仅劳动人民而且相当大的一部分日本资产阶级——主要的是中产阶级和小资产阶级——都反对美国的作威作福。日本商界正反对美国强加给他们的对华贸易的限制。日、美在经济方面的严重矛盾表现在日本与美国之间贸易协定的谈判上。“朝日新闻”最近报道，在这次谈判中，日本反对美国要在这个条约中规定美国资本在日本有毫无限制的行动自由的要求，日本表示它要保护它的工业和对外贸易。
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府与美国政府之间自一九五二年二月开始谈判的美日通商航海条约，草案业已完成。这个条约是旧金山对日“和约”的补充，美国垄断资本将通过这个条约无限制地控制日本经济，进一步剥削日本人民。
    据共同社的消息说，美日通商航海条约的“范本”是美哥（哥伦比亚）“友好”通商航海条约。大家知道，哥伦比亚是在华尔街控制下的一个毫无独立气息的拉丁美洲国家。美国在谈判过程中坚持以美哥条约为美日通商航海条约的蓝本，其目的就是要完全取消日本的经济主权，使日本更彻底地变为美国的殖民地。共同社说：新的美日通商航海条约的“一个使人注意的地方是旧条约（指一九一一年缔结的美日通商航海条约）中的‘民族主义色彩’已一扫而空”。根据新条约，在日本的美国人得享有和日本人同等的权利，也就是所谓国民待遇。据“每日新闻”透露：新的美日通商航海条约放宽了日本现行的“外资法”，“允许美国的个人或公司购买日本公司的占控制数目的股票”。而据日本官方公布，自一九五○年六月实行“外资法”以来，截至一九五二年十一月底为止，外国人已经持有日本企业的股票一亿零八百三十八万八千股，价值八十六亿七千九百多万日元。可以想见，新条约的实行将使美国资本的势力可以毫无限制地渗入日本经济，进一步操纵日本的一切工业、贸易和航运。新条约并规定美国方面可以把从日本剥削得来的利润汇回本国，日本政府不加任何限制。毫无疑问，这个不平等条约将要遭到日本人民的反对。
