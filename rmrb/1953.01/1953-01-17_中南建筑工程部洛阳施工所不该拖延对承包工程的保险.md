    To the Editor: According to national mandatory insurance regulations, the contracting company should be responsible for mandatory insurance on construction materials, uncompleted capital construction projects, and projects that have not yet been transferred to the production departments. However, our Luoyang Packing Plant's major capital construction project, contracted by the Luoyang Construction Office of the Second Engineering Company of the Central South Construction Engineering Department, has been under construction for five or six months since July 16, 1952, and all materials entering the plant and uncompleted capital construction projects have not been insured at all. After discovering this problem, the Luoyang Office of the Bank of Communications, together with the People's Insurance Company of China, came to the Luoyang Packing Plant and the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company in mid-October last year to discuss and request that the existing materials and uncompleted projects be insured. However, the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation of insurance. After the patient persuasion of the Bank of Communications and relevant parties, the unit agreed to insure all incoming materials and agreed that the Bank of Communications would take stock of the materials and check the storage conditions of the materials at the end of October (as stipulated in the contract), and be responsible for handling the insurance procedures for the uncompleted projects, with the insurance premiums to be paid from the capital construction funds. In this way, the Bank of Communications gave the insurance application form to the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company and explained the insurance procedures to them. However,
    it was delayed until the beginning of November, and despite repeated urging from the Bank of Communications, the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company still did not go through the procedures. As for the inventory of materials, they said that the materials team had no person in charge and could not carry out the inventory. At that time, it happened that the Special District Finance and Economics Committee held a meeting. The Special District Finance and Economics Committee criticized the attitude of the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company in violating the mandatory insurance regulations at the meeting, and emphasized that the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company was responsible for all insurance. Comrade Zhang Jiuhai, the leader of the materials team of the Luoyang Construction Office of the Engineering Company, did not raise any objections at the meeting at that time, but after the meeting, the unit still ignored the issue and was irresponsible, so that the matter has been delayed until now without being resolved.
    We believe that the Luoyang Construction Office of the Second Engineering Company of the Central South Construction Engineering Department disregards state property, neglects insurance policies, and puts state property in a state of uncontrolled danger, which is extremely inappropriate. We hope they will resolve this issue quickly.

### 中南建筑工程部洛阳施工所不该拖延对承包工程的保险

    中南建筑工程部洛阳施工所不该拖延对承包工程的保险
    编辑同志：根据国家强制保险条例，进行基本建设工程的材料、基本建设未完工的工程、还没有转入生产部门的工程，都应由承包公司负责，实行强制保险。但我们洛阳打包厂的较大基本建设工程，由中南建筑工程部第二工程公司洛阳施工所负责承包，自一九五二年七月十六日开始施工到现在已有五六个月了，所有进厂材料及基本建设未完工程还完全没有实行保险。交通银行洛阳办事处发现这个问题以后，曾于去年十月中旬会同中国人民保险公司前来洛阳打包厂和工程公司洛阳施工所商谈，要求把现有材料及未完工的工程实行保险。但工程公司洛阳施工所对实行保险表示不满。后经交通银行和有关方面的耐心说服，该单位才同意把所有入厂材料，实行投保，并同意交通银行在十月底清点材料及检查材料存储情况（这是合同上的规定），把未完工的工程负责办理投保手续，而保险费由基本建设费内开支。这样交通银行就把投保单给了工程公司洛阳施工所，并对他们交代了投保手续。但是
    一直延至十一月初，虽经交通银行再三催促，工程公司洛阳施工所却仍然不办理手续，对清点材料，他们却说材料组无负责人，不能实行清点。当时恰遇专区财政经济委员会召开会议，专区财政经济委员会在会上对工程公司洛阳施工所违犯强制保险条例的态度作了批判，并强调指出全部投保都由工程公司洛阳施工所负责。工程公司洛阳施工所材料组长张九海同志当时在会议上也没有提出什么反对意见，但会后该单位对此问题仍置之不理，不负责任，以致此事一直拖到现在还没有解决。
    我们认为中南建筑工程部第二工程公司洛阳施工所漠视国家财产，轻视保险政策，使国家财产处于自流危险状态之下，是极不应该的。希望他们迅速处理这个问题。
