    Oil Reversal in Hebei Oil-Producing Areas Causes Loss of State Property
    Provincial Oil and Fat Company Cancels Reasonable Inventory Levels for Fear of Accumulated Goods

    Hebei Province is a production area for oil crops such as peanuts and sesame. The oil and oil materials produced in Hebei Province are not only used to supply the consumption of residents in Hebei Province but are also transported to other provinces for sale and to meet export needs. Among the needs of residents in Hebei Province for oil, the third quarter of each year is the most urgent. The Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company should, in principle, reserve sufficient oil and oil materials for sale in the third quarter. However, the company does not reserve a certain amount of oil and oil materials according to the needs of the province's residents. Fearing the accumulation of goods, they blindly transport most of the oil and oil materials they purchase to Tianjin. When the supply of oil materials in the province's market falls short of demand, they transport large quantities of oil and oil materials back from Tianjin or other regions and distribute them to various places. The result of the commodity reversal is that state property suffers unnecessary losses.

    In the first and second quarters of last year, the company transported most of the peanut oil it purchased in various places to Tianjin. In the third quarter, it successively transferred more than 720 tons from Tianjin and distributed them to Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Bozhen, Handan, Hengshui, Dingxian and other places. Calculated by one-way train freight, the loss would be 151.7 million yuan; calculated by round-trip freight, the loss would be 303 million yuan. The costs of handling, loading and unloading, freight yard rent, depreciation of packaging supplies, and damage during transportation have not yet been calculated.

    The Xinji branch of Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company also blindly transported 120 tons of sesame to Tianjin in May and June last year, but in July last year, it transferred 60 tons back from Tianjin. In mid-June last year, the state-owned listed price of peanut oil in the Baoding area was lower than the market price. In principle, the Oil and Fat Company should have controlled enough peanut oil and sold it in time to stabilize the oil price. However, the Baoding Oil and Fat Branch blindly reduced its inventory and transported the peanut oil and oil materials stored in Wangdu, Liangxiang, Baoding and other places to Tianjin. Later, when the oil price problem became serious, it transferred oil and oil products from other regions to sell and suppress prices. Similar situations also occurred in other parts of Hebei Province.

    According to statistics, in the past two years, the Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company has transported 1,863 tons of various oil products and 684 tons of various oil materials back from Tianjin. The loss is significant. The loss caused by the failure to supply the market with oil and oil materials to stabilize oil prices is even incalculable.

    Recently, state-owned trade in various places has been inspecting and opposing the accumulation of goods, which is necessary. However, some comrades, for fear of accumulating goods, do not even reserve the goods that should be reserved, which is also wrong. The lesson of the Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company should be taken seriously by all localities. (Ren Bin, Zheng Shufeng)

    河北产油区油品倒流使国家财产遭受损失
    该省油脂公司因害怕积压商品竟取消合理库存量
    河北省是花生、芝麻等油料油品的产地。河北生产的油品油料除了供应河北省的居民消费以外，并运销其他各省，和供应出口的需要。在河北省居民对油品的需要中，每年以第三季度最为殷切。河北省油脂公司按理应储备足够的油料油品，以供第三季度销售之用。但该公司不按本省居民的需要储备一定的油品油料，他们害怕积压商品，盲目地把所收购的油品油料大部运往天津，到本省市场油料供不应求时，又从天津或其他地区运回大批油品油料，分送各地。商品倒流的结果，使国家财产遭受不必要的损失。
    该公司去年第一、二季度在各地收购的花生油，绝大部分都运往天津，到第三季度又先后从天津调回七百二十余吨，分运石家庄、保定、泊镇、邯郸、衡水、定县等地，以单程火车运费计算，即损失一亿五千一百七十余万元；如以来回的双程运费计算，即损失三亿零三百余万元。搬运、装卸、货场租金、包装用品折旧和途行伤耗等等还未计算在内。
    河北省油脂公司所属的辛集分公司，去年五、六月间也曾盲目运送一百二十吨芝麻到天津，但到去年七月份又从天津调回六十吨。保定地区在去年六月中旬即已发生花生油的国营牌价低于市价的现象，按理油脂公司应该掌握足够的花生油，及时出售，以稳定油价。但保定油脂分公司却盲目缩压库存，把望都、良乡、保定等地库存的花生油料运往天津。后来油价问题严重了，才从其他地区运回油料油品来抛货抑价。河北省其他各地也有类似情况。
    据统计：两年来河北省油脂公司由天津倒运回去的各种油品达一千八百六十三吨，倒运回去的各种油料达六百八十四吨。其损失是很大的。因油品油料不能供应市场平抑油价所造成的损失更是无法计算。
    最近各地国营贸易都在检查和反对积压商品，这是必要的。但有的同志为了怕积压商品，连应该储备的商品也不储备，这也是不对的。河北省油脂公司的教训应引起各地重视。（任彬、郑树锋）
