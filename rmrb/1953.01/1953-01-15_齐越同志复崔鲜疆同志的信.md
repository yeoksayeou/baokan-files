    Comrade Qi Yue's Reply to Comrade Cui Xianjiang
    Dear Comrade Xianjiang: Your enthusiastic letter from the Shangganling front deeply moved me and my colleagues. We excitedly told each other, "The most beloved person from the Shangganling front has written!" Then more comrades came to us, vying to read the letter. We all gathered together, our eyes filled with tears of excitement, reading your letter aloud, again and again.
    Dear comrade! As I write back to you, the images of many heroes shine brightly before me. Heroes like Maтроsov-style hero Huang Jiguang, Yang Gensi-style hero Sun Zhanyuan, Dong Cunrui-style hero Zhu Xiaoguang and Wang Wancheng are all role models for me to learn from. For those martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the American invaders, I, along with the people of the whole country, mourn them with the most respectful feelings. They are immortal!
    Dear comrade! Recently, the Second Delegation to Korea to Comfort has returned to the motherland and is reporting your heroic deeds in various places, broadcasting to the whole country on the radio. This greatly inspires the enthusiasm of the people of the motherland for production and construction and strengthens the determination to win the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. I work at the national radio station, and I know I bear an important and glorious task. Recently, we held the First National Broadcasting Work Conference. Through this conference, our broadcasting cause will be further developed. Please tell the comrades on the Korean front to continue their heroic fighting with renewed vigor! We must broadcast your heroic deeds well to the whole country and the whole world, making friends cheer and enemies tremble!
                Broadcaster, Central People's Broadcasting Station, Qi Yue

    齐越同志复崔鲜疆同志的信
    敬爱的鲜疆同志：你从上甘岭前线寄来的充满热情的信，深深地感动了我以及和我一起工作的同志。我们兴奋地互相传告着：“上甘岭前线最可爱的人来信了！”于是更多的同志纷纷跑到我们这里来，争着看这封信。我们大家围在一起，眼里含着激动的泪水，高声地、一遍又一遍地读着你的来信。
    亲爱的同志！当我给你写回信的时候，许多英雄的形象在我的面前闪耀着光辉。马特洛索夫式的英雄黄继光、杨根思式的英雄孙占元、董存瑞式的英雄朱肖光和王万成等都是我学习的榜样。对于那些在反对美国侵略者的斗争中光荣牺牲的烈士们，我和全国人民一样，都用最崇敬的心情悼念着他们。他们是不朽的啊！
    亲爱的同志！最近，第二届赴朝慰问团已经回到祖国，正在各地报告你们的英雄事迹，在广播电台向全国广播。这就大大地鼓舞祖国人民生产建设的热情和加强抗美援朝的必胜信念。我是在祖国的无线电广播台工作的，我知道我担负着重要而光荣的任务。最近我们召开了第一次全国广播工作会议。通过这次会议我们的广播事业将要进一步发展。请你告诉朝鲜前线的同志们，再接再厉地英勇战斗吧！我们一定要好好地向全国、全世界广播你们的英雄事迹，让朋友们欢呼，让敌人颤抖！
                中央人民广播电台广播员　齐越
