    Suggest that the Shen County People's Government Resolve the Issue of Li Yinkun's Wife Being Abused
    To the Editor: Li Yinkun's wife, from Gaoyan Village, Fifth District, Shen County, Hebei Province, is suffering abuse from her mother-in-law and elder sister-in-law. Li Yinkun's wife works hard, but since she got married, her husband's family has not given her any clothes; she has to rely on her own family to provide them. The food she gets is also very unfair: the mother-in-law and elder sister-in-law eat white flour rolls, while she can only gnaw on sorghum or bran cakes, and she can't even get any vegetables. Three years ago, Li Yinkun was once married to another woman, who was also constantly tormented by the mother-in-law and elder sister-in-law. Unable to bear it, that woman divorced and left. Now, this woman is replacing her, suffering abuse and torment, and is often "nitpicked." When the village established a people's school, the neighbor's daughters and wives went to school, but her mother-in-law would not let her go. Whenever she goes outside to feed the pigs or fetch firewood, either the elder sister-in-law follows to monitor her, or the younger sister-in-law is sent along to see if she has told others about the dirty secrets of how her family treats its daughter-in-law. This woman often sheds tears behind her mother-in-law and elder sister-in-law's backs, saying, "Life is meaningless, it would be better to die."
    We believe that this is very dangerous and is at least a very unhappy family. Moreover, the elder sister-in-law also has a husband and in-laws, and it is very inappropriate for her to stay at her mother's home all the time, being lazy and unwilling to work. We suggest that the Shen County People's Government and the Women's Federation appropriately handle the issue of Li Yinkun's family as soon as possible.

    建议深县人民政府解决李印昆妻子受虐待的问题
    编辑同志：河北省深县第五区高盐场村李印昆的妻子正在受着婆婆和大姑子的虐待。李印昆的妻子劳动很好，但从结婚以来，婆家不给衣服穿，要向娘家去想法；吃的也很不公平：婆婆和大姑子们吃白面卷子，她只能啃高粱或麸子面饼子，菜更吃不上。三年以前，李印昆曾经娶过一个媳妇，也是成天受婆婆和大姑子的折磨。实在受不了，那妇女离婚走了。以后，这个妇女又顶替着受气、受折磨，并且常常被“鸡蛋里挑骨头”。村里成立了民校，邻家的姑娘、媳妇都去上学，可是她的婆婆就不让她去。每逢她到门外喂猪或取柴火，不是大姑子跟着监视，就是派小姑子一同去。看她是否和别人讲了她家对待媳妇的肮脏底子。这妇女常背着婆婆、大姑子们掉眼泪说：“活着没有意思，还不如死了好。”
    我们认为，这样下去很危险，起码也是一个极不幸福的家庭，况且大姑子也有丈夫、有婆家，这样好吃懒做地常住娘家，很不应该。建议深县人民政府和妇女联合会适当地处理李印昆家的问题，越快越好。　高照群　林彬
