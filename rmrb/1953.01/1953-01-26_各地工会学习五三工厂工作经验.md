Following the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' (ACFTU) December 1952 decision to promote the work experience of Factory 53's trade union, trade union organizations in various regions, under the leadership of local Party committees, actively convened various meetings to introduce the work experience of Factory 53 and prepared to promote it in a planned and systematic way.

The North China Working Committee of the ACFTU made a decision at its Standing Committee meeting that it would promote the work experience of Factory 53 throughout the entire North China region this year, and do a good job in grassroots work to adapt to large-scale economic construction. The Central South Working Committee of the ACFTU held a special meeting to convey the work experience of Factory 53 and formulated a plan for study and promotion. The Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Suiyuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, and the Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, as well as the trade union organizations of many factories and mines, are organizing the study and promotion of Factory 53's experience. The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee has also formed a working group to conduct key experiments at the Nanjing Radio Factory.

According to the spirit of the ACFTU's decision, trade unions in various regions first organized cadres, especially leading cadres of provincial and municipal trade unions, to earnestly study the work experience of Factory 53, study the spirit and characteristics of Factory 53's experience, in order to further examine and improve their work. The Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions began organizing cadres from its own organs and various industrial trade union organs on January 12 to study relevant documents. The documents included the CCP Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, articles by Liu Shihua, Secretary of the Party Committee of Factory 53, Qi Tinghan, Chairman of the Trade Union, and Gao Fangqi, Director of the Factory, the summary of Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the ACFTU at the National Trade Union Grassroots Work Conference, the People's Daily editorial, and the Worker's Daily editorial. The study period is one month. The Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions requires cadres to deeply understand the work experience of Factory 53 in this study, so as to examine their work in the next stage, find the key, and propose methods for improvement. The Suiyuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions organized cadres from its own organs, various industrial trade unions, and local trade unions in various cities, special districts, leagues, counties, banners, and towns to study the work experience of Factory 53; and required trade union organizations at all levels to avoid all unnecessary administrative entanglements during the study period, and not to hold any meetings that could be postponed or avoided, concentrating their energy and focusing on the study. The Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions decided to first organize cadres from its own organs and cadres from major grassroots organizations for systematic and in-depth study. Two and a half days a week are used as study time. And from January 15th, training courses will be held to train grassroots and workshop cadres. In addition, lectures will be jointly organized with newspapers and radio stations. The Huainan Mining Area Trade Union convened a joint meeting of trade union chairmen from various mines on January 7 to study the work experience of Factory 53, and will convey it to various mines, creating a surge of enthusiasm for studying the work experience of Factory 53 throughout the mining area.

Trade union cadres in various regions warmly welcomed the work experience of Factory 53 in their studies. They believe that Factory 53's complete and systematic experience is of great help to trade union work in various regions. The Beijing Transportation Company's work locations are scattered, some in Mentougou, more than forty miles from the city, but cadres all rushed to the company in time to study Factory 53's experience. They said: "Studying Factory 53's experience is of great benefit to work, and even though the road is far, we cannot be late or leave early."

Currently, there are still some ideological obstacles among trade union cadres in various regions during the study. For example, when students at the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School were studying the experience of Factory 53, some people believed that Factory 53 was large in scale and had many workers, so it needed such a complete set of complex working methods; our small factories do not need this working method, and it is useless to learn it. Some people believe that Factory 53 was liberated early and had good conditions, so it could adopt such advanced working methods; we were liberated late, conditions are poor, and work is chaotic, so there is no way to learn. Others believe that Factory 53 has strong leadership, so work can be done so well; our leadership is weak, so we cannot do well. Trade union organizations in various regions are combining criticism of these incorrect ideas, calling for further in-depth study of Factory 53's experience, and studying methods for improvement in connection with their own work.

    各地工会学习五三工厂工作经验
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会在一九五二年十二月发布关于推广五三工厂工会工作经验的决定后，各地工会组织在当地党委的领导下，积极召开了各种会议，介绍五三工厂的工作经验，并准备有计划、有步骤地加以推广。
    中华全国总工会华北工作委员会在常务委员会上作出决定，今年要在全华北区推广五三工厂工作经验，做好基层工作，以适应大规模的经济建设。中华全国总工会中南工作委员会召开了专门会议，传达五三工厂工作经验，并订出了学习、推广的计划。黑龙江省总工会、山西省总工会、绥远省总工会、江苏省总工会筹备委员会和西安市总工会、哈尔滨市总工会、唐山市总工会以及许多工厂矿山的工会组织，正组织学习和推广五三工厂的经验。江苏省总工会筹备委员会并组成工作组到南京市有线电厂进行重点试验。
    根据中华全国总工会决定的精神，各地工会首先组织干部、特别是省市工会的领导干部，认真学习五三工厂工作经验，研究五三工厂经验的精神和特点，以便进一步检查和改进工作。哈尔滨市总工会在一月十二日开始组织本机关及各产业工会机关干部学习有关文件。文件包括中共中央关于领导方法的决定，五三工厂党委书记刘诗华、工会主席齐廷汉和厂长高方启的文章，全国总工会秘书长赖若愚在全国工会基层工作会议上的总结，人民日报社论和工人日报社论。学习时间为一个月。哈尔滨市总工会要求干部在这次学习中深刻领会五三工厂的工作经验，以便在下一阶段检查工作，找出关键，提出改进工作的办法。绥远省总工会组织本机关、各产业工会和各市、专区、盟、县、旗、镇地方工会干部，学习五三工厂的工作经验；并要求各级工会组织，在学习期间，必须避免一切不必要的事务纠缠，不开一切可以缓开或可以不开的会议，集中精力，专心进行学习。唐山市总工会决定首先组织本机关干部和各主要基层组织干部进行系统的、深入的学习。每星期用两天半时间作为学习时间。并从
    一月十五日起举办训练班，训练基层和车间干部。此外，还要联合报纸与广播电台共同举办讲座。淮南矿区工会在一月七日召开了各矿场工会主席联席会议，学习了五三工厂的工作经验，并将向各矿进行传达，在全矿区掀起一个学习五三工厂工作经验的热潮。
    各地工会干部在学习中热烈欢迎五三工厂工作经验。他们认为五三工厂这一完整而系统的经验，对各地工会工作有很大的帮助。北京运输公司工作地点分散，有的在离城四十多里的门头沟，但干部们都及时赶来公司学习五三工厂的经验。他们说：“学习五三工厂经验对工作有很大好处，虽然路远，也不能迟到早退。”
    目前，各地工会干部在学习中还有一些思想障碍。如河南省总工会干部学校学员在学习五三工厂经验时，有的人认为五三工厂规模大，工人多，所以要有这样整套的复杂的工作方法；我们小厂用不着这种工作方法，学了不顶用。有的人认为五三工厂解放得早，条件好，所以能够采用这样先进的工作方法；我们解放得晚，条件差，工作混乱，没法学习。又有的人认为五三工厂领导强，工作能做得这样好；我们领导弱，做不好。各地工会组织正在结合批判这些不正确的思想，号召进一步深入学习五三工厂的经验，并联系本身工作，研究改进的办法。        （据工人日报消息）
