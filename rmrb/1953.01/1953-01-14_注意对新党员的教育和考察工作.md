    Pay Attention to the Education and Observation of New Party Members
    Since the Central Committee issued instructions on Party building, a number of new Party members have been developed in various parts of the country. In the future, with the development of Party building work, more activists will be admitted into the Party and become probationary members. Therefore, doing a good job in the education and observation of probationary members has become an important task for Party committees at all levels in Party building work.
    However, some Party organizations and Party member cadres have not paid attention to this work. They believe that new Party members have undergone serious observation and education before joining the Party, and there is no need for education and observation during the probationary period. This idea is obviously wrong. Whether a probationary member can become a full member requires not only long-term and effective ideological education and observation outside the Party, but also a period of strict testing and training within the Party. This is the only way for the Party organization to more directly, deeply, and comprehensively examine the ideological awareness and political qualities of a probationary member, so as to prevent certain oversights that may occur in the work of admitting new Party members; and only then can they further "educate them to understand the Party Constitution and the Party's program and policies, and to enable them to establish the basic views of communists, such as organizational views, labor views, mass views, and the realistic and materialistic views" (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party"). This is an important step indispensable for ensuring the quality of Party members and consolidating the Party organization. Any phenomenon that disregards the education of probationary members is incompatible with the fundamental principles of Party building.
    How should Party organizations work with probationary members? The Organization Department of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee has put forward several important suggestions, namely: running training classes for new Party members to systematically educate them on basic Party knowledge; assigning new Party members to certain Party work to give them practical tests and training; and assigning formal Party members to conduct individual, in-depth, and regular education and observation of probationary members, strictly organizing Party life, and using criticism and self-criticism to educate and observe probationary members. These suggestions are all correct. Party organizations at all levels should seize the work of educating and observing probationary members, so that each probationary member can truly be examined and educated by the Party during the probationary period, so as to turn a large number of probationary members into formal members in accordance with the Party Constitution and the standards for Party members.

    注意对新党员的教育和考察工作
    自从中央发布关于建党工作的指示以后，全国各地已陆续发展了一批新党员。今后随着建党工作的开展，将有更多的积极分子被接收到党内来，成为候补党员。因此，作好对候补党员的教育、考察工作，已成为当前各地党委在建党工作中的一项重要任务。
    但是目前有些党的组织和党员干部却没有重视这一工作，他们以为新党员入党前，经过了认真的考察和教育，在候补期中就没有什么教育和考察的必要了。这种想法显然是错误的。一个候补党员能否做一个正式党员，不仅需要在党外对他进行长期而有效的思想教育工作和考察工作，而且还必须在党内再给予一定时期的严格的考验和锻炼。这样才能使党的组织更直接、深入、全面地审查一个候补党员的思想觉悟和政治品质，以防范在接收新党员工作中可能产生的某些疏忽现象；也才能进一步“教育他们认识党章和党的纲领与政策，并使他们确立共产党人的基本观点，如组织观点、劳动观点、群众观点、实事求是的唯物观点等”（刘少奇：“论党”）。这是保证党员质量，巩固党的组织所不可缺少的一个重要步骤。任何漠视对候补党员进行教育工作的现象，都是和建党的根本原则不能相容的。
    党的组织应该怎样对候补党员进行工作呢？沈阳市委组织部提出了几项重要的意见，即开办新党员训练班，系统地进行党的基本知识的教育；分配新党员以一定的党的工作，予以实际的考验和锻炼；并责成正式党员对候补党员进行个别、深入、经常的教育和考察工作，严格组织生活，以批评与自我批评的方法来教育和考察候补党员。这些意见都是正确的。各地党的组织都应该抓紧进行教育、考察候补党员的工作，使每个候补党员在候补期中真正受到党的考察、教育，以便按照党章规定和党员标准使大批的候补党员转为正式党员。
