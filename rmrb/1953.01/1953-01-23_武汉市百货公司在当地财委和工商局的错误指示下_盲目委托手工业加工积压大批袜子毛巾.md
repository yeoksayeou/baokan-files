    Wuhan Department Store, Under Erroneous Instructions from Local Finance Committee and Industry & Commerce Bureau, Blindly Entrusts Handicraft Processing, Resulting in Large-Scale Stockpiling of Socks and Towels
    Under the instructions of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Wuhan Municipal Company of China Department Store blindly entrusted a large amount of sock and towel processing to local handicraft knitting industry. Because the products largely failed to meet consumer needs, a serious backlog occurred. Over a year, the company entrusted the processing of approximately 390,000 dozens of socks and 220,000 dozens of towels. To date, only a small portion has been sold to consumers, with the majority stockpiled in state-owned enterprise warehouses. According to statistics, the stockpiles of these entrusted processing products at the Wuhan Department Store amount to over 110,000 dozens of socks and 30,000 dozens of towels, while the stockpiles at Hubei Provincial Department Store and other units amount to 150,000 dozens of socks and 100,000 dozens of towels. Based on an average price of 5,000 yuan per pair of socks and 3,000 yuan per towel, the value of these stockpiled goods exceeds 20 billion yuan.
    The Wuhan Department Store's entrustment of sock and towel processing to local handicraft knitting industry began around October 1951. At that time, the Wuhan Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau instructed the Wuhan Department Store to organize local sock and towel knitters and entrust all processing to them, with the aim of supporting production and preventing unscrupulous merchants from acquiring cotton yarn for illegal operations. The Wuhan Department Store agreed to do so. Because machine-made socks and towels had larger sales volume in Wuhan, and the quality and specifications of handicraft products mostly failed to meet residents' needs, these processed products were difficult to sell, and inventory increased daily. The staff of the Wuhan Department Store realized that this problem needed to be resolved after the launch of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns in 1952, but because the focus was on carrying out the "Three-Anti" campaign at the time, the number of socks and towels processed was reduced, and therefore this issue was not raised. After the end of the "Three-Anti" campaign, as business gradually returned to normal, the company proposed no longer continuing this entrusted processing. The Central South Region Company of China Department Store agreed with this opinion and instructed that operations should "determine production based on sales." However, the Wuhan Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau insisted that the Wuhan Department Store continue to entrust processing, citing reasons such as "supporting production" to prevent handicraft workers from becoming unemployed, and so on. Finally, it was decided to appropriately reduce the quantity of this processing—socks by 30 percent and towels by 50 percent. However, the processed goods continued to be stockpiled. Until September 1952, when the state-owned department store system adjusted its structure, and the Central South Region Wuhan Wholesale Station was established, this entrusted processing business was reduced again and then transferred to the wholesale station, but there were still no sales channels for the entrusted processed goods.
    Clearly, the causes of this stockpile are: First, the aforementioned relevant units lacked investigation and analysis of the production and sales situation of Wuhan's handicraft knitting industry products, and blindly decided to carry out entrusted processing. Second, the Wuhan Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, from the one-sided perspective of supporting production and preventing handicraft workers from becoming unemployed, insisted that the Wuhan Department Store entrust the processing of unsaleable goods. They failed to recognize that while supporting production is something that should be done, it should be based on the public's needs for different products, considering whether these productions have development prospects, and the impact of such support, etc., to determine the target of support, the degree of support, and how to support. Avoiding unemployment for producers is correct, but appropriate measures should be taken, and state-owned trading enterprises should not be used to entrust the processing of unsaleable goods to alleviate unemployment. Third, the Wuhan Department Store did not do a good job in supervising and inspecting production and strictly accepting processed products in the entrusted processing, resulting in increasingly poor products. According to staff members of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Department Stores, many of the processed socks had sock openings that were too small, making them impossible for adults to wear, and too big for children to wear, and they were of inconsistent lengths and elasticity, and easily discolored; many towels were not durable because the bleaching powder technology used during production had problems, and after a large amount had been stockpiled, mold damage occurred.
    State-owned trading enterprises in various regions should learn from the Wuhan case of blindly entrusting processing, which has resulted in serious commodity stockpiling. They should strengthen the investigation and research of production and sales situations, guarantee the quality of entrusted processing and purchased products, in order to improve the management and operation of state-owned trading enterprises.

### 武汉市百货公司在当地财委和工商局的错误指示下  盲目委托手工业加工积压大批袜子毛巾

    武汉市百货公司在当地财委和工商局的错误指示下
    盲目委托手工业加工积压大批袜子毛巾
    中国百货公司武汉市公司在武汉市人民政府财政经济委员会及工商局的指示下，盲目地委托当地手工针织业大量加工袜子、毛巾，因产品多不合消费者的需要，造成了严重积压现象。先后一年多时间，该公司委托加工的袜子约计三十九万打，毛巾二十二万打，到目前为止，只有一小部分销到消费者手里，大部分都积压在国营企业的仓库里。据统计，这项委托加工的产品，积压在武汉市百货公司的有袜子十一万打、毛巾三万打以上，积压在湖北省百货公司等单位的有袜子十五万打，毛巾十万打。以每双袜子平均五千元，每条毛巾平均三千元计算，这些被积压的商品价值二百亿元以上。
    武汉市百货公司委托当地手工针织业加工袜子、毛巾是从一九五一年十月间开始的。武汉市工商局当时指示武汉市百货公司，把当地织袜和织毛巾的手工业者加以组织，全部委托其加工，目的是扶持生产，并避免奸商套购棉纱从事非法经营。武汉市百货公司也同意这样做。由于武汉市销量较大的是机制袜子和毛巾，手工业产品的质量、规格多不合居民需要，这批加工的产品很难销售，库存一天天加大。武汉市百货公司的工作人员认识到这个问题必须解决的时候，是一九五二年展开“三反”“五反”运动以后，但因当时集中力量进行“三反”，加工袜子、毛巾的数量减少，因此没有提出这个问题。“三反”结束后，业务逐渐恢复正常，该公司即提出不再继续进行这项委托加工。中国百货公司中南区公司同意这个意见，并指示在经营上应“依销定产”。但武汉市财政经济委员会和工商局仍坚持要武汉市百货公司继续委托加工，理由仍然是“扶持生产”，以免手工业者失业，等等。最后决定适当减少这项加工的数量——袜子减百分之三十，毛巾减百分之五十。但加工的商品仍是积压下来。直到一九五二年九月，国营百货系统调整机构，中南区武汉批发站成立，这项委托加工业务再度减缩后，即转给批发站，但委托加工的商品仍无销路。
    很明显，造成这种积压的原因是：第一，上述有关单位对武汉市手工针织业产品的产销情况缺乏调查分析，即盲目决定进行委托加工。第二，武汉市财政经济委员会、工商局从片面的扶持生产，避免手工业者失业的观点出发，坚持要武汉市百货公司委托加工没有销路的商品。他们没有认识到：扶持生产是应该作的事情，但是应该根据群众对不同产品需要的情况，考虑这些生产有无发展前途，以及这样扶持所起的影响等，来决定扶持的对象、扶持的程度和如何扶持。避免生产者失业是对的，但是应采取妥善的办法，而不能以国营贸易企业委托加工没有销路的商品来救济失业。第三，武汉市百货公司没有作好在委托加工中督促、检查生产及严格验收加工产品的工作，致使产品越来越坏。据湖北省和武汉市百货公司的工作人员谈：很多加工的袜子袜口过小，大人穿不上，小孩穿上大，而且长短、松紧不一，并且容易变色；很多毛巾因为生产时使用漂粉的技术有问题，所以不结实，大量积压后，即发生霉毁现象。
    各地国营贸易企业应从武汉市盲目委托加工造成严重商品积压的事件中吸取教训。应该加强产销情况的调查研究，保证委托加工和收购的产品的质量，以便改善国营贸易企业的经营管理。
