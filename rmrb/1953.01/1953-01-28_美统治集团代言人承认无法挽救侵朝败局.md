Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: American generals and newspaper columnists continue to chatter about how to salvage the defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, but they have to admit that every "way out" is "fraught with difficulties and dangers."

According to a United Press report, retired former commander of the US Eighth Army, Robert Eichelberger, declared on the 22nd that his "solution" to the Korean War stalemate was to use the Rhee Syngman puppet army to replace the US troops. His reason was: "If the American troops attempt to break through the current Communist defense line," they would encounter "a disastrous defeat" because "even with all the available troops that can be drawn from the United States to reinforce, we still do not have enough strength." He said that the failure of such an offensive would be even "more serious" than MacArthur's disastrous retreat in the spring of 1951. He warned the American generals who are planning a new offensive: "The reason for that failure was that we made a major mistake in underestimating the enemy, and at the same time made an equally major mistake in overestimating ourselves. Let us not repeat this mistake." Eichelberger advocated that the United States should "no longer rely" on American troops, but double the Rhee Syngman puppet army, and increase their strength in terms of numbers. However, Eichelberger has never been able to explain: If the army of the United States, the ringleader of the aggression group, cannot win the war, how can the Rhee Syngman puppet army, composed of forcibly conscripted soldiers, win?

Regarding the possibility of such a frontal attack, American columnists the Alsop brothers also discussed it in the January 16th issue of the "Washington Post." The Alsop brothers said that even the likes of Clark and Van Fleet admit: "A frontal attack on the current Chinese army's line cannot be considered, because this line is now twenty miles deep, and the enemy's fortifications are really too solid. For the same reason, the tactical use of the atomic bomb in Korea is unlikely to be effective."

The Alsop brothers further explored military adventures other than frontal attacks. Regarding the amphibious landing offensive behind the Korean and Chinese lines that American generals are so fond of, the Alsop brothers said that this plan has many shortcomings. First, "it will take at least nine months to gather the necessary materials." Moreover, "the number of casualties may reach 50,000, or even more." "The worst thing is" that this landing force may be "encircled from both sides" by the Korean and Chinese People's forces, "caught in a pincer," and completely annihilated.

The Alsop brothers said that in order to avoid this fate of annihilation, some people advocate "various diversionary attacks against China and Manchuria." However, the Alsop brothers said that this "adventure" is "not an absolutely necessary insurance measure for the offensive within Korea," and "contains terrible dangers." If the adventure fails, not only will it not be able to salvage the defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, "but it will trigger a war of much greater scale and cost in the Far East, at which time the Western alliance will probably disintegrate, and even the American public opinion that most supports MacArthur's views will denounce it as a 'government error'."

As for using the Kuomintang bandit troops on the Korean battlefield, the Alsop brothers admitted that this also has "very serious" shortcomings, because Rhee Syngman, who is afraid of falling out of favor with his American masters, "strongly opposes" it, "and such an action will certainly cause hysteria among our European allies."

The Alsop brothers said that because "finding a way out is fraught with difficulties and dangers," Eisenhower now cannot help but be "more sympathetic" to the recent American "passivity" in "Korean policy."

### 美统治集团代言人承认无法挽救侵朝败局

    美统治集团代言人承认无法挽救侵朝败局
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国的将军和报纸专栏作家们继续哓哓不休地谈论怎样才能挽回侵朝战争的败局，但是他们不得不承认每一条“出路”都“具有困难和危险”。
    据合众社报道，已经退休的前美军第八军军长罗伯特·艾奇伯格在二十二日宣称：他的解决朝鲜战争僵局的“办法”是用李承晚伪军来代替美国军队。他的理由是：“假如美国军队企图突破目前共产党的防线”，他们便会遭遇“惨重的失败”，因为“即使用美国国内一切可以抽调的兵力去增援，我们还是没有足够的力量”。他说，这种进攻的失败会比麦克阿瑟在一九五一年春天被打得狼狈而逃还要“严重”。他警告正在策划新攻势的美国将军们说：“那次之所以失败，是因为我们犯了对敌人估计太低的重大错误，同时也犯了对自己估计过高的同样重大的错误。让我们不要重犯这种错误。”艾奇伯格主张美国应该“不再依重”美国军队，而把李承晚伪军增加一倍，并从数量上增加他们的实力。但是艾奇伯格始终没有能够说明：侵略集团魁首美国的军队都打不赢的仗，用硬拉来的壮丁编成的李承晚伪军又怎么打得赢？
    关于这种正面进攻的可能性，美国专栏作家阿尔索普兄弟在一月十六日的“华盛顿邮报”上也讨论过了。阿尔索普兄弟说，就是克拉克、范佛里特之流也承认：“对目前的中国军队的阵线作正面进攻，是不能够加以考虑的事情，因为这条阵线现在已有二十英里深，而且敌军的防御工事实在太巩固了。由于同样的理由，原子弹在朝鲜作战术性的使用，大概不会发生效力。”
    阿尔索普兄弟进一步探讨了除了正面进攻以外的其他军事冒险的道路。关于美国将军们津津乐道的在朝中后方实行两栖登陆进攻，阿尔索普兄弟说，这个计划有许多缺点。首先，“集结所需物资至少需时九个月”。而且，“死伤人数可能达到五万，甚或不止此数”。“最坏的是”这支登陆的部队可能被朝中人民部队“从两面进行包围”，“陷入老虎钳中”而被彻底歼灭。
    阿尔索普兄弟说，为了避免这个被歼灭的命运，有人主张“对中国及满洲进行各种不同的牵制性攻击”。但是，阿尔索普兄弟说，这种“冒险行动”“对于在朝鲜境内的攻势并不是绝对必要的保险办法”，而且“包含着很可怕的危险”。如果冒险失败，不但不能挽回侵朝战争的败局，“反而在远东引起了一场规模和代价大得多的战争，那时西方国家的联盟大概将要解体，同时甚至最赞成麦克阿瑟的看法的美国公众舆论，也将斥之为‘政府的过失’”。
    至于在朝鲜战场上使用国民党匪军，阿尔索普兄弟承认这也有“很严重”的缺点，因为害怕失宠于美国主子的李承晚“非常反对”，“而且，这样一个行动一定会在我们欧洲的盟国中间引起歇斯底里”。
    阿尔索普兄弟说，由于“寻找出路具有困难和危险”，艾森豪威尔现在也不能不“更为同情”美国最近“在朝鲜政策上”的“被动性”了。
