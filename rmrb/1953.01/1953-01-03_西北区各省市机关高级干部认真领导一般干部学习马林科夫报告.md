Northwest Region first-level organs, as well as various provinces and municipalities, began studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union around November 20th of last year. Leaders in various locations generally attached importance to this study, personally delivering mobilization reports, which led to a widespread upsurge in learning enthusiasm. Currently, most units have studied up to the second part of Malenkov's report. A few units have even studied up to the third part. During the study, general cadres have commonly reflected that the document is profound and difficult to learn, thus urgently requesting popular and explanatory reports. Experience has proven that wherever explanations are provided, the learning effect is good. The Industry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and the Xi'an Public Security Bureau have all resolved this issue well. In Gansu, in addition to dividing provincial-level senior cadres into three study groups that have held two or three discussion meetings, three comrades from the senior group were designated to give reports to the instructors of the intermediate and primary groups. The primary groups were also divided into eight classrooms by region for lectures. Their method is as follows: first, the theoretical instructors of the intermediate group write a lecture outline, convene the instructors of the primary group to discuss and revise it, finalize the draft, and then issue it to each instructor to prepare for the lecture based on this outline. During the lectures, the theoretical instructors of the intermediate group give a large report to the provincial and municipal-level intermediate groups and instructors of the primary groups (the instructors of the primary groups also attend the lectures), and then the instructors of the primary groups give lectures in eight classrooms respectively. This not only solves the lecture problem for the intermediate and primary groups, but also motivates the instructors and tutors of the primary group, improves the quality of the lectures, and strengthens the work of the tutors. The leading comrades of the Northwest Industry Department also paid attention to the lecture problem for general cadres. They first organized the comrades of the senior group to study ahead of others in order to guide the study of the intermediate and primary groups. When the intermediate and primary groups held study discussion meetings, the comrades of the senior group participated separately, providing specific guidance and answering questions, which greatly enhanced the learning enthusiasm of the general cadres. In Qinghai, the director of the Industry and Commerce Department, Comrade Fu Zihe, gave an explanation on the first part of Malenkov's report to the general cadres at the provincial and municipal levels, and the questions raised by everyone were discussed in the senior group. After drawing conclusions, people were sent to convey them to the cadres of the intermediate and primary groups. Mutual Aid County in Qinghai also studied well. The county party secretary gave two reports to the cadres. In Ningxia Province, Chairman Xing Zhaotang, Director of the Finance Department Shi Zizhen, and Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee Song Youtian lectured provincial and municipal-level cadres in the order of Malenkov's report. Each lecture was recorded, and the recordings were prepared for broadcasting in various counties to solve the lecture problem in the counties. In the Xi'an Public Security Bureau, Deputy Director Zhang Shaokang took the lead in lecturing, which promoted other comrades. Therefore, the problem of instructors for the primary groups was completely solved by relying on the bureau's own strength.

However, at present, responsible comrades in some units still do not pay enough attention to this study. When cadres request reports or answers to questions, they always think that there are no comrades with high theoretical level in their units, and there is a mentality of relying on higher authorities. For example, at the Preparatory Office of the Northwest Construction Engineering General Management Office, when cadres asked the director of the office's study committee to give an explanatory report, he actually said: "Forget it if you can't understand it." In the Xi'an Municipal Government Construction Bureau, there are more than 500 cadres, but only about 200 people participated in the study. The main reason is that the leading cadres did not organize it. Therefore, the learning enthusiasm in these departments is not high, and it is flat and lifeless.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the study, deepen the study, promote the study of senior cadres, and mobilize all cadres, the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specially instructed the party committees in various parts of the Northwest to ensure that the top leaders take responsibility, take personal action, and set an example by studying ahead of the general cadres to motivate everyone. Senior cadres must be organized as core groups to study conscientiously, and special personnel must be designated to lecture the instructors and tutors of the intermediate and primary groups. For important questions and disputed questions raised in the study, they should first be discussed in the senior group to unify understanding and draw conclusions, and then people should be sent to answer the general cadres. In order to ensure study time, it is stipulated that organs above the provincial and municipal levels can try out a half-day study system on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons.

The Xi'an Municipal Party Committee took the lead in implementing the instructions of the Northwest Bureau and rectified the study of senior cadres. On December 9th of last year, Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, personally convened a meeting of members of the Municipal General Study Committee and party member cadres participating in the senior group study to specifically study the study problem. At the meeting, the study of the comrades of the senior group was examined, and all cadres participating in the senior group study in the city were reorganized into a large group, with Comrade Zhao Boping personally serving as the leader, and Comrade Gao Langshan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, serving as the deputy leader. It was divided into four groups, with Mayor Fang Zhongru, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and Minister of the Organization Department Dong Xueyuan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance Committee Chen Yuanfang, and Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee Cong Yiping serving as the group leaders respectively. In addition, it was also determined that Zhao Boping, Fang Zhongru, Dong Xueyuan and other twelve comrades would give reports to cadres of the intermediate and primary groups. On December 10th of last year, they gave an explanation on the first unit of Malenkov's report.

The half-day study system on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons is being promoted in provincial and municipal-level organs in the Northwest region, and has been implemented in the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau, the Northwest Culture and Education Committee, the Northwest Culture Department, and some organs at the provincial level in Shaanxi.

    西北区各省市机关高级干部认真领导一般干部学习马林科夫报告
    西北区一级机关及各省、市，均在去年十一月二十日前后开始学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件。各地领导干部一般都重视了这次的学习，亲自作动员报告，使学习情绪普遍高涨。现在大多数单位已学到马林科夫报告的第二部分。个别单位也有学到第三部分的。在学习中，一般干部较普遍的反映是：文件深，不容易学，因而迫切要求作通俗解释性的报告。经验证明，那里作了讲解问题，那里的学习效果就好。西北军政委员会工业部、甘肃、青海、宁夏、西安市公安局，对这一问题都解决的较好。甘肃除将省级高级干部分编为三个学习组，已进行过两三次讨论会外，又指定高级组三个同志给中级组和初级组的辅导员作报告，并把初级组按地区划分为八个课堂，进行讲课。他们的方法是：首先由中级组理论教员写好讲授提纲，召集初级组教员讨论修改，定稿后再发给各教员，依此提纲作讲课准备。讲的时候，分别先后，先由中级组理论教员给省市级中级组和初级组辅导员作大报告（初级组教员也参加听课），然后再由初级组教员按八个课堂分别讲课。这样，不但解决了中、初级组的讲课问题，而且带动了初级组的教员和辅导员，提高了讲课质量和加强了辅导员工作。西北工业部的领导同志，也注意了对一般干部的讲课问题，他们首先把高级组的同志加以组织，学在前头，以便指导中级和初级组的学习。当中、初级组开学习讨论会时，高级组的同志分别参加，作具体指导，并给解答问题，因之一般干部学习情绪很高。青海由工商厅厅长傅子和同志向省、市级一般干部就马林科夫报告第一部分作了讲解，又把大家提出的问题在高级组讨论，得出结论后再派人向中、初级组干部作传达。青海互助县也学的好，县委书记对干部作过两次报告。宁夏省由主席邢肇棠、财政厅长石子珍、中共省委秘书长宋友田三同志按马林科夫报告的次序，分别向省、市级干部讲授，每次都录了音，准备用录音在各县广播，以解决县上的讲课问题。西安市公安局，由于副局长张少康同志带头讲课，推动了其他同志，因而完全依靠该局本身的力量解决了初级组的教员问题。
    但是，目前也还有一些单位的负责同志对这次学习不够重视，干部们要求作报告或解答问题时，总以为本单位没有理论水平较高的同志，存在着依赖上级的思想。如西北建筑工程总管理处筹备处，干部们要求该处学委会主任作解答报告时，他竟说：“学不懂就算了。”西安市政府建设局，共有五百多干部，而参加学习的只有二百来人，主要原因是领导干部没有加以组织。因此，这些部门的学习情绪就不高，平平淡淡，没有生气。
    中共中央西北局，为了加强学习领导，使学习深入一步，促进高级干部的学习，并把所有干部都推动起来，特指示西北各地党委，必须做到首长负责，亲自动手，并以身作则地学在一般干部前头，来推动大家。高级干部必须组织起来，作为核心小组，认真学习，并指定专人给中、初级组的教员、辅导员讲课。对于在学习中提出的重要问题和争论问题，应首先在高级组讨论，统一认识得出结论后，再派人对一般干部进行解答。为了保证学习时间，并规定省市级以上机关可以试行星期三、六下午半日学习制。
    西安市委首先执行了西北局的指示，整顿了高级干部的学习。去年十二月九日，市委书记赵伯平同志亲自召集市总学委委员和参加高级组学习的党员干部会议，专门研究学习问题。在会上检查了高级组各同志的学习，并把全市参加高级组学习的干部重新编为一个大组，由赵伯平同志亲任组长，市委宣传部长高朗山同志任副组长，下分四个小组，由市长方仲如、市委副书记兼组织部长董学源、市财委副主任陈元方、市委秘书长丛一平分任小组长。另外，还确定由赵伯平、方仲如、董学源等十二位同志给中、初级组干部作报告，去年十二月十日已作了关于马林科夫报告第一单元的讲解。
    对于星期三、六下午半日学习制，正在西北区省、市级各机关中推行，已实行的有西北局宣传部、西北文化教育委员会、西北文化部及陕西省级一部分机关。
