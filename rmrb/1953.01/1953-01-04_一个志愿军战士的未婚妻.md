    A Volunteer Soldier's Fiancee
    Li Wen
    I
    In Henan Village, Shunyi County, Hebei Province, everyone praises an unmarried girl. This girl is called Gao Guizhen, the village branch secretary of the Communist Youth League. Her fiancé is Dong Shigui, in the volunteer army on the Korean front.

    One day in the first month of 1952, Gao Guizhen was holding a meeting in the village office when an old woman suddenly reported a message to her: Gao Guizhen's father-in-law was seriously ill and had written a letter to the front, asking his son to quickly return home to marry a wife. The letter had not yet been sent and was at Director Huang's place in the cooperative. Gao Guizhen quickly ran to the cooperative, first got the unsent letter, and Director Huang also told her the origin of the matter: Gao Guizhen's father-in-law, Dong Ruijin, was an old man, and in addition to being sick, he missed his son even more. A bad element in the village deliberately provoked him: "Gao Guizhen is a red cadre in the village, so why not quickly marry her into the family? In another two years, I'm afraid she won't look at your son!" This made the old man even more eager for his son to return home, so he wrote a letter asking his son to come home. Gao Guizhen thought: Everyone is strengthening the resistance against America and aiding Korea, but the old man is writing a letter to let his son come home. Isn't this dragging the volunteer army down and weakening the strength of the resistance against America and aiding Korea?

    Not long ago, during the Spring Festival, Gao Guizhen had followed a group of young men and women of the Youth League to pay New Year's greetings to the families of military personnel. She had also been to Dong Shigui's house in Nantou, and knew that her father-in-law's tuberculosis had relapsed. She had thought several times about going to his house to inquire about the old man and help them solve some minor difficulties, but she always felt that an unmarried girl was too embarrassed to run to her future in-laws' house. Now, she couldn't care about these things. She decided to personally persuade her father-in-law.

    Gao Guizhen didn't go home for dinner, but took the letter to her future in-laws' house. When she arrived at the gate of her future in-laws' house, she couldn't help but hesitate, but her high degree of patriotism supported her. She awkwardly called out, "Is Mom home?" Dong Shigui's mother was cooking, and when she saw that it was Guizhen who had come, she was surprised and very happy to welcome Guizhen into the house. Guizhen helped her mother-in-law prepare the meal, and then picked up a bowl to feed her sick father-in-law on the kang. The old man realized that it wasn't his daughter feeding him, so he asked, "Whose girl is this?" The old lady said, "This is our girl from the north of the village!" "Dad!" Guizhen affectionately called out to the old man, "Even though I'm not married yet, I'll treat you the same as my own father. Your son being a volunteer soldier is an honor for both of our families. If there are any difficulties at home, I can solve them. If you need to see a doctor, I'll drive you to see a doctor; if there is any work in the fields, plowing, weeding, transplanting seedlings, and harvesting, I can do it all. Just have sister call me, and I'll come!" Dong Ruijin nodded and didn't say anything. Guizhen continued, "Shigui and I are not too old. It won't be too late to get married after the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and defeating the American devils! Besides, Shigui is also planning this way." She took out several letters that Dong Shigui had sent her from the front, and read them to the old man one by one: "I heard that you are already a member of the Communist Youth League, and I am very happy. I hope you will study harder, work actively, and strive to join the Party in 1952... This letter was written under the light of an electric lamp in an air-raid shelter. We are seizing the free time from battle to learn culture. My life is very good and very happy..." "...Looking at the cities and villages in Korea, which have been bombed to the point of collapsing walls and houses, I think how happy our hometown should be! I will never return home until the American invaders are completely defeated." Guizhen also told her father-in-law: "Once last year, I saw you sending a letter to Shigui, and I secretly copied his mailing address, and we started writing letters to each other. He always encourages me to work hard in every letter, and I always remember his words. I work in the fields all day during the day and hold meetings for half the night, and I never feel tired. I feel that doing this is the only way to be worthy of your Shigui. Shigui's help to me is great. When I received his first letter, I was just an ordinary member of the Youth League. He encouraged me, and I did as he said. When I received his second letter, the Youth League members saw that I was doing well in production and working actively, and elected me as the group leader. When I received his third letter, I had already been elected as a member of the League branch committee!" Dong Ruijin lay on the bed, listening quietly. The worried brows slowly unfolded, and he said, "It seems that you two are doing well. I, the old man, have had a weight lifted from my heart. The more you communicate, the better. If you don't have any change, I'll give you money to buy stamps."

    Gao Guizhen's comfort and persuasion to Dong Ruijin were more effective than any medicine. Dong Ruijin's illness lightened, and he felt that eating was also delicious. Gao Guizhen drove to Liqiao and took her father-in-law to see a doctor several times, and the old man's illness gradually improved.

    Dong Ruijin's letter asking his son to come home for marriage was not sent. Instead, another letter was sent to the front. The letter wrote: "I was sick some time ago, thanks to Guizhen's good care, and now my illness has gradually improved... All the farm work in our family is being taken care of by Guizhen. The autumn harvest last year was good, and there are no difficulties at home. You don't have to worry about home..."

    II
    Dong Ruijin's family had twelve mu of land, and there were no male laborers in the family, just the old couple and an eighteen-year-old daughter named Yuqing. Gao Guizhen's father had passed away, and she was the only female laborer, farming eight mu of land. Guizhen decided to take on the work of both families' twenty mu of land. Firstly, she could save labor for the village, and secondly, she could save substitute labor work points for her father-in-law, which could also improve the lives of the two old people.

    Dong Yuqing did not have the habit of working in the fields. Gao Guizhen wanted to first cultivate her into a good laborer as her helper. Seeing that Guizhen worked well and treated people warmly, Yuqing was also willing to be close to her. Gao Guizhen mobilized Yuqing to go to the fields with her to weed the millet seedlings. Yuqing was not used to holding a hoe, and her hands and feet were not coordinated. The ground was also a bit hard, and after hoeing less than a dozen steps, she threw down the hoe and said, "I'm not hoeing anymore, I can't do it!" Guizhen was not anxious, but said gently, "Yuqing, I have an idea for you. Go home and bring the donkey, and plow it once to loosen the soil, and it will be easier to hoe!" Yuqing really brought the donkey, and Guizhen said to Yuqing, "I will teach you without fear of trouble, and you should not be annoyed either." This patience moved Yuqing, and she said, "Sister, as long as you are not afraid of being tired, I am not afraid of being tired either!" Yuqing also learned how to hold the plow. During the break, Guizhen took out a comic book and said, "Don't you like comic books?" When Yuqing heard there were pictures, she sat closer to Guizhen. The comic book told the story of the volunteer army's first-class meritorious soldier, Jie Xiumei. Guizhen explained to Yuqing as she read, "Jie Xiumei is also a daughter of a poor peasant family in our Hebei Province. She does not bow her head to difficulties in her work. She has become a people's meritorious person." Yuqing took the comic book from Guizhen's hand, looked at it carefully, and thought about it. Her big eyes flashed, and she resolutely said, "Okay, if I don't learn how to hoe today, I will change my last name!" That day, Guizhen taught Yuqing how to plow the land and hoe the land. In less than half a year, Dong Yuqing followed Gao Guizhen and learned all kinds of farm work such as plowing the land, cultivating the land, transplanting seedlings, leaving seedlings, driving carts, and using livestock.

    Guizhen and Yuqing were as close as real sisters, working together in the fields and studying together at the literacy school. The old lady also loved Guizhen as if she were her own daughter. Whenever they made dumplings or ate something rare, they would think of her and call her to eat. Guizhen had a cheerful temperament. She was: if there was food, she would eat it; if there was work, she would do it. When the millet was weeded for the third time, the weather was hot. The two girls came back from the fields, put down their hoes, hurriedly ate a mouthful of rice, and picked up their books to leave. The old lady persuaded them, "Who doesn't take a noon break? You two should also take a break!" "No, we're going to the literacy school!" Guizhen and Yuqing said as they sang songs and ran out the door. The two old people looked at the backs of the two girls, feeling both sorry for them and praising them. The old lady said, "The two girls have simply become three addicts: work addicts, study addicts, and song addicts. From the fields to home, from home to the literacy school, they sing while working and sing while walking." Dong Ruijin said, "These two children are really putting the young men to shame. The hot weather is unbearable for the young men, but they work non-stop without taking a noon break!"

    In the entire year of 1952, Dong Ruijin's family only used three substitute labor work points, saving more than sixty work points, and also achieved increased production. His family harvested twenty cloth bags of grain in 1951, and twenty-four cloth bags in 1952. Gao Guizhen's own family also increased production by five cloth bags of grain compared to 1951. The old men in the village praised her, saying, "Gao Guizhen is really the first good girl in our village. She farms twenty mu of land alone; she hasn't delayed the work of the Communist Youth League and the village at all; and speaking of studying, she took second place in the literacy class. She didn't recognize many characters in the past, but now she recognizes more than two thousand characters, can read small newspapers, can write letters, and can read lines from the script when rehearsing plays." In December 1952, Gao Guizhen was elected as a model of preferential treatment of the first class in Shunyi County, and then went to Baoding City to attend the Provincial Labor Model Conference. At the meeting, Gao Guizhen wrote a letter of good news to Dong Shigui, proposing to compete and challenge Dong Shigui. She knew that after Dong Shigui received the good news, he would not only be as happy as her, but also turn the joy into the power to kill the enemy. After returning to the village, she quickly sent detailed challenge conditions to Dong Shigui. The village branch secretary saw her challenge letter and jokingly said to her, "You two are really good. He encourages you, and you encourage him. You have already been encouraged to attend a meeting in Baoding. I think Dong Shigui also has the hope of becoming a returning representative!" Gao Guizhen said, "I haven't thought about whether he will become a returning representative or not. I only hope that he will kill more American invaders and make more contributions." After sending the challenge letter, Gao Guizhen looked forward to and calculated what day she would receive Dong Shigui's letter of acceptance. She also excitedly thought: maybe there will be good news of meritorious service sent back!

    一个志愿军战士的未婚妻
    力文
    一     
    在河北省顺义县河南村，人人称赞一个没出嫁的姑娘。这个姑娘叫高桂珍，是青年团的村支部书记，她的未婚夫叫董世贵，在朝鲜前线志愿军部队里。
    一九五二年正月里的一天，高桂珍正在村公所开会，忽然一个老太太向她报告一个消息，高桂珍的公爹病重了，去信到前方，让他儿子赶快回家娶媳妇。信还没寄走，在合作社黄主任那里。高桂珍连忙跑到合作社，先拿到那封未发出的信，黄主任还告诉她事情的原委：高桂珍的公爹董瑞金，是上年岁的人，再加上有病，越发想念儿子，村上有个坏分子，又故意在他面前挑唆：“人家高桂珍是村上的红干部，还不赶紧娶过门，晚二年，怕人家看不上你儿子了！”这使老头子越发盼儿回家，就写了叫儿回家的信。高桂珍想：人人都加强抗美援朝，他老人家写信让儿子回家，这不是拉志愿军的后腿，削弱抗美援朝的力量吗？
    不久前的春节，高桂珍曾随着一伙男女青年团员给军属们拜年，也到过南头董世贵的家，知道公爹的痨病又犯了，她曾几次想到他家去问候一下老人家，帮助他们解决些零星困难，可是总觉得，没出嫁的大闺女，怎好意思往婆家跑。现在，她顾不得这些了，她决定亲自去劝说公爹。
    高桂珍没有回家吃饭，便拿着那封信往婆家去了。她走到婆家门口，不由自主地犹疑了一下，但高度的爱国热情支持着她。她不自然地喊了一声：“妈在家吗？”董世贵的娘正在做饭，看到是桂珍到家来了，她惊异地又是十分欢喜地把桂珍迎到屋里。桂珍帮助婆婆做好了饭，又端起碗给病在炕上的公爹喂饭，老头子发觉喂饭的并不是他闺女，便问道：“这是那家的姑娘啊！”老太太说：“这就是北头的咱家那个姑娘啊！”“爸！”桂珍亲热地称呼老人家，“别看我还没结婚，我待你老人家和俺爸爸一样。您儿子当志愿军，是咱两家的光荣，家里有啥困难，我都能解决。你老人家要看病，我赶车送您去看病；地里有啥活，耕、锄、拔苗、收割我都行，让妹子叫我一声，我就来啦！”董瑞金老汉点了点头没说啥，桂珍接着说：“我和您世贵年纪都不大，抗美援朝胜利，打败了美国鬼子再结婚也不晚！再说，您世贵也是这样打算。”她从口袋里掏出来几封董世贵从前方寄给她的信，一封一封地念给老汉听：“听说你已经是青年团员了，我很高兴。希望你更加努力学习，积极工作，争取在一九五二年入党……这封信是在防空洞电灯光下写的，我们正抓紧战斗空闲时间学文化。我的生活很好，很快乐……”“……看着朝鲜的城市、村庄，被炸得墙倒屋塌，我想咱们家乡该多么幸福啊！不彻底打垮美国强盗，我决不回家。”桂珍还告诉公爹说：“去年有一次，我看到您老人家给世贵寄信，我暗中把他的通讯地址抄下来，俺俩便通开信啦。他每次来信总是鼓励我好好工作，我时时刻刻记住他的话，白天在地里忙一天活，晚上开半夜会，啥时也不觉累。我觉得这样做，才对得起您世贵。您世贵对我的帮助可大哩，接到他第一封信的时候，我还是个普通的青年团员，他鼓励我，我按着他的话做，二次接到他来信的时候，团员们看着我生产好，工作又积极，选我当了小组长，当接到他第三封信时，我已被选为团的支部委员啦！”董瑞金老汉躺在床上静静地听着，愁锁着的眉头，慢慢舒展开了，他说：“看起来，您俩个好着哩，我老头子去掉了一块心病。您俩越通信越好，你没零钱，我给你钱买邮票。”
    高桂珍对董瑞金老汉的安慰和劝说，比什么药都有效。董老汉的病轻了，吃饭也觉着香了。高桂珍赶着车去李桥，送公爹看了几次病，老汉的病便渐渐好了。
    董瑞金老汉那封让儿子回家结婚的信没发，寄往前方的是另外一封信。信上写着：“前些时我病了，多亏桂珍照应的好，现在病已渐渐好了，……咱家的一切庄稼活都有桂珍担当起来，去年秋收不错，家中没啥困难，你万不用挂念家……”
    二
    董瑞金家有十二亩地，家中没有男劳动力，老俩口和一个十八岁的闺女——叫玉卿。高桂珍的爸爸去世了，只她一个女劳动力，种着八亩地。桂珍决心把两家二十亩地的活都担当起来，一来可节省村里的劳动力，二来为公爹节省下代耕工票，也可改善两个老人的生活。
    董玉卿没有下地劳动的习惯，高桂珍想先把她培养成一个好劳动，作为自己的帮手。玉卿见桂珍劳动好，待人亲热，也愿意亲近她。高桂珍动员玉卿和她一块下地锄谷苗。玉卿没拿惯锄，手脚不顺劲，地又硬一些，锄了不到十几步，把锄头一扔说：“不锄啦，我干不了！”桂珍没有着急，反而和言悦色地说：“玉卿，我给你出个主意，你回家把驴牵来，用犁坌上一遍，轻松一下土，就好锄啦！”玉卿果真把驴牵来了，桂珍对玉卿说：“我教你不怕烦，你也别烦。”这种耐心，把玉卿感动了，她说：“大姐，只要你不怕累，我也不怕累！”玉卿也学会扶犁了。休息的时候，桂珍拿出一本连环画说：“你不是喜欢连环画吗？”玉卿听说有画，便向桂珍靠近坐下。连环画是画志愿军一等功臣解秀梅的故事，桂珍一面看，一面向玉卿解释：“人家解秀梅也是咱河北省的一家贫农的闺女，干工作不向困难低头，她当了人民功臣。”玉卿从桂珍手里拿过来连环画，仔细地瞅着，想着，她两只大眼睛一忽闪，坚决地说：“行了，今天学不会锄地，我就改姓啦！”这一天，桂珍教会了玉卿坌地、锄地。不到半年功夫，坌地、耕地、拔苗、留苗、赶车、使牲口等等庄稼活，董玉卿都跟着高桂珍学会了。
    桂珍和玉卿两个人，像亲姊妹一样亲热，一块下地生产，一块到民校学习。老太太也像疼亲闺女一样疼桂珍，每逢包饺子，或者是吃点啥稀罕东西，都想着她，叫她来吃。桂珍是个畅快脾气，她是：有饭就吃，见活就做。谷子锄三遍的时候，天气正热，两个姑娘从地里回来，放下锄头，急忙吃口饭，拿起书本就要走。老太太劝她俩：“谁家不歇晌，您俩也歇歇吧！”“不，俺到民校去哩！”桂珍、玉卿一面说着，一面唱着歌子便跑出门去了。两位老人看着两个姑娘的背影，又心疼，又夸奖她们。老太太说：“俩个丫头简直成了三迷：干活迷，学习迷，又是歌迷。从地里到家，从家到民校，干着活唱，走着路也唱。”董瑞金老汉说：“这两个孩子真是气死小伙子，火暴的天，小伙子受不了，她俩不歇晌地干！”
    一九五二年全年，董瑞金家只用了三个代耕工票，节省下六十多个工票，还得到了增产，他家一九五一年收二十布袋粮食，一九五二年收了二十四布袋；高桂珍自己家也较一九五一年增产了五布袋粮食。村上的老汉们都称赞她，老汉们说：“高桂珍真是咱村第一个好闺女。两头二十亩地，她一个人种着；青年团的，村上的工作，一点没耽搁；说学习吧，参加速成识字班考第二名。她过去不认几个字，现在认二千多字，能看小报，能写信，排演戏时，拿起本本能念台词。”三一九五二年十二月，高桂珍当选为顺义县甲等优抚模范，接着又去保定市出席了省劳动模范会议。在会议上，高桂珍向董世贵写了一封报喜的信，提出来向董世贵竞赛挑战。她知道董世贵接到喜讯后，不仅会和她一样的欢喜，而且会把喜悦变成杀敌的力量。回村以后，她又很快向董世贵寄去了详细的挑战条件。村支部书记看到了她的挑战书，向她打趣说：“你俩口子真不赖，他鼓励你，你鼓励他，你已被鼓励到保定开会了。我看，董世贵也有当归国代表的希望哩！”高桂珍说：“他当不当归国代表，我还没想到。俺只希望他多杀几个美国强盗，多立几次功。”发出挑战书，高桂珍便盼望着，计算着什么日子能接到董世贵的应战书。她还兴奋地想着：说不定还会有立功的喜报寄来呢！
