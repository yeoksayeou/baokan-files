    A Volunteer Soldier's Fiancee
    Li Wen
    I
    In Henan Village, Shunyi County, Hebei Province, everyone praises an unmarried girl. This girl is called Gao Guizhen, the village branch secretary of the Communist Youth League. Her fianc√© is Dong Shigui, in the volunteer army on the Korean front.

    One day in the first month of 1952, Gao Guizhen was holding a meeting in the village office when an old woman suddenly reported a message to her: Gao Guizhen's father-in-law was seriously ill and had written a letter to the front, asking his son to quickly return home to marry a wife. The letter had not yet been sent and was at Director Huang's place in the cooperative. Gao Guizhen quickly ran to the cooperative, first got the unsent letter, and Director Huang also told her the origin of the matter: Gao Guizhen's father-in-law, Dong Ruijin, was an old man, and in addition to being sick, he missed his son even more. A bad element in the village deliberately provoked him: "Gao Guizhen is a red cadre in the village, so why not quickly marry her into the family? In another two years, I'm afraid she won't look at your son!" This made the old man even more eager for his son to return home, so he wrote a letter asking his son to come home. Gao Guizhen thought: Everyone is strengthening the resistance against America and aiding Korea, but the old man is writing a letter to let his son come home. Isn't this dragging the volunteer army down and weakening the strength of the resistance against America and aiding Korea?

    Not long ago, during the Spring Festival, Gao Guizhen had followed a group of young men and women of the Youth League to pay New Year's greetings to the families of military personnel. She had also been to Dong Shigui's house in Nantou, and knew that her father-in-law's tuberculosis had relapsed. She had thought several times about going to his house to inquire about the old man and help them solve some minor difficulties, but she always felt that an unmarried girl was too embarrassed to run to her future in-laws' house. Now, she couldn't care about these things. She decided to personally persuade her father-in-law.

    Gao Guizhen didn't go home for dinner, but took the letter to her future in-laws' house. When she arrived at the gate of her future in-laws' house, she couldn't help but hesitate, but her high degree of patriotism supported her. She awkwardly called out, "Is Mom home?" Dong Shigui's mother was cooking, and when she saw that it was Guizhen who had come, she was surprised and very happy to welcome Guizhen into the house. Guizhen helped her mother-in-law prepare the meal, and then picked up a bowl to feed her sick father-in-law on the kang. The old man realized that it wasn't his daughter feeding him, so he asked, "Whose girl is this?" The old lady said, "This is our girl from the north of the village!" "Dad!" Guizhen affectionately called out to the old man, "Even though I'm not married yet, I'll treat you the same as my own father. Your son being a volunteer soldier is an honor for both of our families. If there are any difficulties at home, I can solve them. If you need to see a doctor, I'll drive you to see a doctor; if there is any work in the fields, plowing, weeding, transplanting seedlings, and harvesting, I can do it all. Just have sister call me, and I'll come!" Dong Ruijin nodded and didn't say anything. Guizhen continued, "Shigui and I are not too old. It won't be too late to get married after the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and defeating the American devils! Besides, Shigui is also planning this way." She took out several letters that Dong Shigui had sent her from the front, and read them to the old man one by one: "I heard that you are already a member of the Communist Youth League, and I am very happy. I hope you will study harder, work actively, and strive to join the Party in 1952... This letter was written under the light of an electric lamp in an air-raid shelter. We are seizing the free time from battle to learn culture. My life is very good and very happy..." "...Looking at the cities and villages in Korea, which have been bombed to the point of collapsing walls and houses, I think how happy our hometown should be! I will never return home until the American invaders are completely defeated." Guizhen also told her father-in-law: "Once last year, I saw you sending a letter to Shigui, and I secretly copied his mailing address, and we started writing letters to each other. He always encourages me to work hard in every letter, and I always remember his words. I work in the fields all day during the day and hold meetings for half the night, and I never feel tired. I feel that doing this is the only way to be worthy of your Shigui. Shigui's help to me is great. When I received his first letter, I was just an ordinary member of the Youth League. He encouraged me, and I did as he said. When I received his second letter, the Youth League members saw that I was doing well in production and working actively, and elected me as the group leader. When I received his third letter, I had already been elected as a member of the League branch committee!" Dong Ruijin lay on the bed, listening quietly. The worried brows slowly unfolded, and he said, "It seems that you two are doing well. I, the old man, have had a weight lifted from my heart. The more you communicate, the better. If you don't have any change, I'll give you money to buy stamps."

    Gao Guizhen's comfort and persuasion to Dong Ruijin were more effective than any medicine. Dong Ruijin's illness lightened, and he felt that eating was also delicious. Gao Guizhen drove to Liqiao and took her father-in-law to see a doctor several times, and the old man's illness gradually improved.

    Dong Ruijin's letter asking his son to come home for marriage was not sent. Instead, another letter was sent to the front. The letter wrote: "I was sick some time ago, thanks to Guizhen's good care, and now my illness has gradually improved... All the farm work in our family is being taken care of by Guizhen. The autumn harvest last year was good, and there are no difficulties at home. You don't have to worry about home..."

    II
    Dong Ruijin's family had twelve mu of land, and there were no male laborers in the family, just the old couple and an eighteen-year-old daughter named Yuqing. Gao Guizhen's father had passed away, and she was the only female laborer, farming eight mu of land. Guizhen decided to take on the work of both families' twenty mu of land. Firstly, she could save labor for the village, and secondly, she could save substitute labor work points for her father-in-law, which could also improve the lives of the two old people.

    Dong Yuqing did not have the habit of working in the fields. Gao Guizhen wanted to first cultivate her into a good laborer as her helper. Seeing that Guizhen worked well and treated people warmly, Yuqing was also willing to be close to her. Gao Guizhen mobilized Yuqing to go to the fields with her to weed the millet seedlings. Yuqing was not used to holding a hoe, and her hands and feet were not coordinated. The ground was also a bit hard, and after hoeing less than a dozen steps, she threw down the hoe and said, "I'm not hoeing anymore, I can't do it!" Guizhen was not anxious, but said gently, "Yuqing, I have an idea for you. Go home and bring the donkey, and plow it once to loosen the soil, and it will be easier to hoe!" Yuqing really brought the donkey, and Guizhen said to Yuqing, "I will teach you without fear of trouble, and you should not be annoyed either." This patience moved Yuqing, and she said, "Sister, as long as you are not afraid of being tired, I am not afraid of being tired either!" Yuqing also learned how to hold the plow. During the break, Guizhen took out a comic book and said, "Don't you like comic books?" When Yuqing heard there were pictures, she sat closer to Guizhen. The comic book told the story of the volunteer army's first-class meritorious soldier, Jie Xiumei. Guizhen explained to Yuqing as she read, "Jie Xiumei is also a daughter of a poor peasant family in our Hebei Province. She does not bow her head to difficulties in her work. She has become a people's meritorious person." Yuqing took the comic book from Guizhen's hand, looked at it carefully, and thought about it. Her big eyes flashed, and she resolutely said, "Okay, if I don't learn how to hoe today, I will change my last name!" That day, Guizhen taught Yuqing how to plow the land and hoe the land. In less than half a year, Dong Yuqing followed Gao Guizhen and learned all kinds of farm work such as plowing the land, cultivating the land, transplanting seedlings, leaving seedlings, driving carts, and using livestock.

    Guizhen and Yuqing were as close as real sisters, working together in the fields and studying together at the literacy school. The old lady also loved Guizhen as if she were her own daughter. Whenever they made dumplings or ate something rare, they would think of her and call her to eat. Guizhen had a cheerful temperament. She was: if there was food, she would eat it; if there was work, she would do it. When the millet was weeded for the third time, the weather was hot. The two girls came back from the fields, put down their hoes, hurriedly ate a mouthful of rice, and picked up their books to leave. The old lady persuaded them, "Who doesn't take a noon break? You two should also take a break!" "No, we're going to the literacy school!" Guizhen and Yuqing said as they sang songs and ran out the door. The two old people looked at the backs of the two girls, feeling both sorry for them and praising them. The old lady said, "The two girls have simply become three addicts: work addicts, study addicts, and song addicts. From the fields to home, from home to the literacy school, they sing while working and sing while walking." Dong Ruijin said, "These two children are really putting the young men to shame. The hot weather is unbearable for the young men, but they work non-stop without taking a noon break!"

    In the entire year of 1952, Dong Ruijin's family only used three substitute labor work points, saving more than sixty work points, and also achieved increased production. His family harvested twenty cloth bags of grain in 1951, and twenty-four cloth bags in 1952. Gao Guizhen's own family also increased production by five cloth bags of grain compared to 1951. The old men in the village praised her, saying, "Gao Guizhen is really the first good girl in our village. She farms twenty mu of land alone; she hasn't delayed the work of the Communist Youth League and the village at all; and speaking of studying, she took second place in the literacy class. She didn't recognize many characters in the past, but now she recognizes more than two thousand characters, can read small newspapers, can write letters, and can read lines from the script when rehearsing plays." In December 1952, Gao Guizhen was elected as a model of preferential treatment of the first class in Shunyi County, and then went to Baoding City to attend the Provincial Labor Model Conference. At the meeting, Gao Guizhen wrote a letter of good news to Dong Shigui, proposing to compete and challenge Dong Shigui. She knew that after Dong Shigui received the good news, he would not only be as happy as her, but also turn the joy into the power to kill the enemy. After returning to the village, she quickly sent detailed challenge conditions to Dong Shigui. The village branch secretary saw her challenge letter and jokingly said to her, "You two are really good. He encourages you, and you encourage him. You have already been encouraged to attend a meeting in Baoding. I think Dong Shigui also has the hope of becoming a returning representative!" Gao Guizhen said, "I haven't thought about whether he will become a returning representative or not. I only hope that he will kill more American invaders and make more contributions." After sending the challenge letter, Gao Guizhen looked forward to and calculated what day she would receive Dong Shigui's letter of acceptance. She also excitedly thought: maybe there will be good news of meritorious service sent back!
