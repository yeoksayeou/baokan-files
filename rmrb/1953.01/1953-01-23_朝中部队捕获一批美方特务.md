Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 22nd: This reporter learned from relevant sources on the front lines that, in preparation for launching new military adventures, the American aggressors have been continuously dispatching large numbers of spies and secret agents into North Korea since December of last year to carry out activities. Some of these spies and secret agents were parachuted in from the air, some infiltrated ashore from the sea, and a few infiltrated through the ground battle lines. They impersonated personnel of the Korean People's Army or the Chinese People's Volunteers, and even sent teenagers disguised as students to infiltrate our side. However, the rear areas of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are solid and well-defended, and these spies and secret agents were captured by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people in a very short period of time. From December 25th to 27th of last year, our side successively captured all personnel of three detachments of the U.S. special agent "Far East Command of the U.S. Army stationed in Korea Liaison Office Parachute Guerrilla Second Squad" who landed in Yichuan, Goksan, Yangdeok and other places.

According to the confessions of the captured spies, their missions were to gather intelligence on the deployment of our reserve forces, the state of coastal defense fortifications, and the location of airfields, to sabotage our important transportation lines, locomotives, warehouses, etc., and to organize so-called "enemy rear guerrilla forces" to cooperate with their "new military operations." Among the items they carried were rocket launchers, submachine guns, rifles, explosives, detonators, landmines, radio stations, operational maps, and other weapons and supplies.

At present, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and the Korean people continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance against all the conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressors.

    朝中部队捕获一批美方特务
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社前线记者自有关方面获悉：美国侵略者为准备发动新的军事冒险，自去年十二月以来即不断派遣大批特务、间谍潜入北朝鲜进行活动。这些特务、间谍有的是从空中降落的，有的是从海上潜行登陆的，少数是通过地面战线潜入的。他们冒充朝鲜人民军或中国人民志愿军的人员，甚至派十几岁的少年扮成学生模样潜入我方。但是，朝中人民军队的后方是巩固的、严密的，这些特务、间谍在很短时间内就被朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民捕获。去年十二月二十五日至二十七日，我方即先后在伊川、谷山、阳德等地捕获了在上述地区降落的美方特务“美军远东司令部驻韩联络处降落伞游击队第二小队”中的三个分队的全部人员。
    据被捕的特务供认，他们的任务是刺探我军后备兵力的部署、海岸防御工事情况、机场位置等，破坏我军重要运输线、火车机车、仓库等，并组织所谓“敌后游击武装”，配合其“新的军事行动”。他们携带的物件中有火箭筒、冲锋枪、步枪、炸药、雷管、地雷、无线电台、作战地图及其他武器、物资。
    现在，朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民对美国侵略者的一切阴谋诡计，继续保持着高度的警惕。
