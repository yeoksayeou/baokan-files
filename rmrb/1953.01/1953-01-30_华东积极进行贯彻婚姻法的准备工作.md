Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 29th. The East China region is actively carrying out various preparations for the movement to implement the Marriage Law. The East China Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee was officially established on January 27th, with Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman of the East China Administrative Committee, as the director, and Liang Guobin, Zhao Mingxin, Zhu Zemin, Qiu Yihan, Deng Yuzhi, and Zhang Kai as deputy directors.

In order to deeply understand the situation and gain experience in a timely manner, the East China Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee Office has transferred more than 40 cadres from various departments to form pilot work groups. These groups have gone to Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces to select key townships and villages to conduct typical experiments for the Marriage Law implementation movement. The work groups that have completed the typical experimental work are currently reporting, researching, and summarizing. The typical experimental work in various provinces and cities has also begun successively.

The East China propaganda departments are rushing to print a large number of materials to promote the Marriage Law. Among them, the Xinhua Bookstore alone is distributing 79 kinds, totaling 4.5 million copies, including illustrated guides to the Marriage Law, comic books, drum lyrics, clapper talk, and scripts.

The East China Administrative Committee issued an instruction on January 27th regarding the launch of the Marriage Law implementation movement. The instruction pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law, governments at all levels must first educate cadres, especially cadres in districts, townships (villages), urban neighborhood committees, and judicial cadres, to correct their understanding of the Marriage Law. All rural areas, factories, government offices, schools, and streets should hold meetings, organize reports, and widely promote the Marriage Law through exhibitions, broadcasts, distribution and posting of various propaganda materials, and the use of films and dramas. The instruction specifically pointed out that, given that the reform of the marriage system is a matter within the people, different from the struggle of peasants against landlords, and that the feudal marriage system has deep social roots, in handling various cases of violating the Marriage Law, it is necessary to be serious and earnest, adhere to the policy of patient education, and treat different situations separately.

    华东积极进行贯彻婚姻法的准备工作
    【新华社上海二十九日电】华东区正积极进行贯彻婚姻法运动的各项准备工作。华东贯彻婚姻法运动委员会已在一月二十七日正式成立，由华东行政委员会副主席张鼎丞任主任，梁国斌、赵明新、朱则民、邱一涵、邓裕志、张凯任副主任。
    为了深入了解情况、及时取得经验，华东贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室已自各部门抽调了四十多名干部组成试点工作组，分赴山东、安徽、江苏三省选择重点乡、村进行贯彻婚姻法运动的典型试验，目前已完成典型试验工作的工作组正在进行汇报、研究和总结。各省市的典型试验工作也已相继开始。
    华东区各宣传部门正赶印大量宣传婚姻法的材料。其中由新华书店发行的即有七十九种、四百五十万册，包括婚姻法图解、连环画、鼓词、快板和剧本等。
    华东行政委员会在一月二十七日发布了关于开展贯彻婚姻法运动的指示。指示指出：为保证婚姻法的贯彻，各级人民政府必须首先教育干部，尤其是区、乡（村）以及城市居民委员会的干部和司法干部，端正他们对婚姻法的认识。一切农村、工厂、机关、学校、街道都应普遍召开会议，组织报告，并通过举办展览会、组织广播、散发与张贴各种宣传品以及利用电影、戏剧等方式，广泛进行婚姻法的宣传工作。指示特别指出：鉴于婚姻制度的改革是人民内部的事情，不同于农民对地主的斗争，而封建婚姻制度又有其深远的社会根源，因此在处理各种违犯婚姻法的案件时，既要严肃认真，又要坚持耐心教育的方针，并应按照不同情况分别对待。
