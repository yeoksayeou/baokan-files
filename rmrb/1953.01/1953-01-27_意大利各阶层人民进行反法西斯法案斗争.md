Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 24th—After 63 hours of fierce debate, the Italian Parliament's lower house, manipulated by the Gasperi government, passed a vote of confidence in the government on the 21st, forcing the people to accept the electoral system "reform" bill that violates the constitution and democratic principles. Angry people from all walks of life in Italy are waging a fiery struggle everywhere to combat the government's fascist conspiracy.

The Gasperi government's aim in "reforming" the electoral system is to establish a dictatorial rule so that it can continue to implement the US's war policy. According to the government's absurd bill, in the general election this spring, as long as Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party and its alliance obtain more than 50% plus one vote of the total votes, they can seize 65% of the seats. In order to force the parliament to pass this blatant fascist bill without discussion, the Gasperi government demanded that the parliament hold a vote of confidence.

The Italian Parliament's lower house began discussing the government's demands on the 18th. Members of parliament from the Communist Party, Socialist Party, and left-wing democrats stood up and spoke one after another, thoroughly exposing the government's conspiracy. When the lower house held a vote of confidence on the 21st, about 200 members of parliament refused to participate in the vote to protest the government's fascist bill; members of parliament from the Communist Party, Socialist Party, and left-wing democrats shouted the slogan "Long live the Constitution" and withdrew from the meeting. They then held a joint meeting and decided to send a delegation to report to President Luigi Einaudi on the situation formed by the passage of the government's electoral system "reform" bill.

While the democratic forces and the government's reactionary forces were engaged in a fierce struggle in the lower house, the people of Italy were also holding general strikes and large-scale demonstrations against the government's electoral system "reform" conspiracy. The working people of Rome and the province of Rome began a 24-hour general strike at 3:30 pm on the 20th. All workers in many factories stopped working, many schools held strikes, and tram and bus traffic in Rome was also cut off for an hour. Marches and demonstrations were held in many places in Rome and its suburbs. Several thousand people participated in the demonstration in Genoa; many factories in Verona, Trento, Modena, Livorno, Salerno and other places held strikes. Women across Italy responded to the call of the Italian Women's Union and launched a "Protest Movement Week." When the lower house held a vote of confidence on the 21st, the people of Rome were holding a large demonstration. The police carried out brutal suppression of the demonstrators, injuring more than 200 people and arresting nearly 3,000. However, on the 22nd, the people of Rome continued to hold marches and demonstrations.

    意大利各阶层人民进行反法西斯法案斗争
    【新华社二十四日讯】罗马消息：意大利议会下院经过了六十三小时激辩后，于二十一日在加斯贝利政府操纵下，通过了对政府的信任票，强迫人民接受违反宪法和民主原则的选举制“改革”法案。愤怒的意大利各阶层人民正在到处进行火热的斗争，打击政府的法西斯阴谋。
    加斯贝利政府要“改革”选举制度，是为了要建立独裁统治，以便继续执行美国的战争政策。按照政府的荒谬法案，在今年春天的大选中，加斯贝利的天主教民主党及其联盟所获得的选票只要比总票数的百分之五十多一票，它们就能窃据百分之六十五的议席。加斯贝利政府为了强迫议会不经讨论就通过这个露骨的法西斯法案，就要求议会举行信任投票。
    意大利议会下院在十八日开始讨论政府的要求，共产党、社会党和左翼民主分子的议员一个接着一个起立发言，彻底揭穿了政府的阴谋。在二十一日下院举行信任投票时，约有二百个议员拒绝参加投票，以示抗议政府的法西斯法案；共产党、社会党和左翼民主分子的议员高呼“宪法万岁”的口号，退出了会场。他们随后又举行联席会议，决定派遣代表团，向总统路易吉·伊诺第报告由于通过政府的选举制“改革”法案而形成的局势。
    当民主力量和政府派反动力量在下院进行剧烈斗争的时候，意大利全国人民也正在举行总罢工和大示威，反对政府的选举制“改革”阴谋。罗马市和罗马省劳动人民在二十日十五点半开始二十四小时总罢工，许多工厂全体工人都停止了工作，许多学校都举行了罢课，罗马市内电车和公共汽车交通也断绝了一小时。罗马市内和郊区许多地方都举行了游行示威。热那亚有好几千人参加了示威游行；味罗那、特伦多、摩登纳、里窝那、萨勒诺等地的许多工厂，都举行了罢工。意大利全国妇女响应意大利妇女联盟的号召，展开了“抗议运动周”。二十一日下院在举行信任投票时，罗马人民正在举行大示威。警察对示威群众进行野蛮的镇压，打伤了两百多人，逮捕了差不多三千人。但是在二十二日，罗马人民又继续举行游行示威。
