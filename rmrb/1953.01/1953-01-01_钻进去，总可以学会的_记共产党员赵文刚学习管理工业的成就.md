By Immersing Himself, He Could Always Learn It
— On the Achievements of Communist Party Member Zhao Wengang in Learning Industrial Management
By Our Correspondent Shang Kai

    Zhao Wengang is the Deputy Director and Party Committee Member of Chongqing Factory 101. When the Party Committee decided in October 1951 that he should concurrently serve as the Director of the Capital Construction Department of the factory, Zhao Wengang gladly accepted this glorious task. Zhao Wengang understood that capital construction is the starting point of the motherland's industrialization and a glorious position for a Communist Party member.

    Capital construction work was indeed completely unfamiliar to Zhao Wengang, who had just been transferred from the army. He didn't even understand a very common term. However, the work required Zhao Wengang to immediately become familiar with this business, familiar with the scientific and technical issues in this business. Engineering blueprints were waiting for him to review and sign, various technical meetings were waiting for him to draw conclusions, and various engineering deployments were waiting for him to make decisions. Once, at a technical meeting to study the manufacture of ×-ton crane steel beams, some suggested that the steel plates should be beveled and annealed after oxygen cutting, while others said that they should not be beveled and annealed. Although this was a very small issue, Zhao Wengang could not come up with his own opinion and finally had to make a decision based on the opinions of the designers. In this situation, Zhao Wengang was reminded of the mistakes he had made in the past when he was responsible for material supply and financial management because he was not familiar with the business. For example, once he signed a fake contract. Zhao Wengang deeply realized that a Communist Party member cannot just work with loyalty and enthusiasm; he must also learn business and technology. Otherwise, he would make many mistakes in his work and cause great losses to the country.

    Zhao Wengang thought: It is indeed not easy for an ordinary person to become an expert. But he also thought that he was a Communist Party member. Communist Party members should have unlimited loyalty and enthusiasm for the Party's cause, a spirit of humbly learning from the masses, and a method of being good at concentrating the wisdom and technology of the masses; under the Party's constant correct leadership, all difficulties can be overcome, and everything can be learned.

    This is a fact: Twenty years ago, Zhao Wengang was a small farmhand in the home of a landlord in northern Sichuan, living a life like a beast of burden. But after joining the revolution, he was trained to become an excellent military commander. This period of revolutionary struggle powerfully encouraged Zhao Wengang and gave him the confidence to learn everything. He said, "In the past, I was able to learn military struggle, and today I can also learn industrial construction. Although industrial construction is more complicated than military struggle, it is not impossible to learn, especially for a Communist Party member."

    At that time, the capital construction situation of Factory 101 was quite chaotic. Unreformed technical management personnel controlled the leadership work and controlled important departments such as design, planning, finance, processing orders, and acceptance. They colluded with illegal capitalists to steal state property. Therefore, the progress of the project was very slow. Even a leveling project that could be completed in a few months could be delayed for fifteen months without being completed. The Party Committee of Factory 101 instructed Zhao Wengang to immediately change the above chaotic situation and ensure the early completion of the project task. After thinking, Zhao Wengang assured the Party that he could complete all the project tasks by the end of 1952. Some people exclaimed in surprise, "This is impossible. In such a short period of time, let alone building such a complex project as Factory 101, even simple factory buildings are difficult to build. The leveling project in the past took more than a year." Zhao Wengang understood that relying on the strength of a few people alone could not build it, but relying on the broad masses of workers and learning from advanced experience, the project plan could definitely be completed. This is just as the Party Committee instructed: "Although we do not understand technology, as long as we are good at concentrating the wisdom and technology of the broad masses of workers, we can solve all the complex technical problems in capital construction and complete the project tasks ahead of schedule." In fact, this is what Zhao Wengang did. How to shorten the construction period and complete the project tasks ahead of schedule? This question was solved only after Zhao Wengang and technical personnel and workers discussed it many times. At the beginning, the technical personnel calculated according to the old method, that is, first building the factory building and then the furnace. By the end of 1952, at the fastest, only the factory building construction plan could be completed. Zhao Wengang, based on the simultaneous construction method in many new construction projects in the past two years, proposed the method of building the factory building and the furnace at the same time to ensure the completion of the project task. This was a new question for Zhao Wengang, and he was not very sure, so he first brewed it among the broad masses of workers and then formally submitted it to everyone for discussion. At the same time, he inspired the technical personnel from all aspects to accept this new plan. For example, telling the story of "building the temple and the Buddha at the same time" vividly illustrated the principle that the factory building and the furnace can be built at the same time. After a lot of experimentation and education, this "three-dimensional cross-construction method" (the same as the segmented parallel assembly line operation method in the Northeast) was accepted by all the workers. The implementation of this construction method found an important guarantee for completing all the project tasks in 1952.

    The problems in the project are never finished, and only by constantly discovering and solving problems can we move forward. In the construction of the foundation project, the problem of concrete cracking occurred. Technical personnel and workers had never seen such a thing and could not propose any improvement methods. Zhao Wengang was even more anxious when he saw that the project was forced to stop. Zhao Wengang thought: Could it be that we are forced to stop work like this? Could it be that we are overwhelmed by such difficulties? No, he thought, such problems may have already been solved in the Soviet Union and the Northeast. So he carefully studied books and magazines about introducing the experience of Soviet and Northeast civil engineering. He found the answer in these books: The cracking of concrete is because slag cement has a higher water absorption rate than ordinary cement. Therefore, it is easy to crack when the water-cement ratio is used for general mixing. After Zhao Wengang found out the cause of the cracking, he discussed the mixing ratio of slag cement with the technical personnel. In this process, he also opposed an erroneous statement that slag cement should be abandoned and ordinary cement should be used, because changing to ordinary cement would not only cause 3,000 tubes of slag cement to be overstocked, but also because ordinary cement was not available at that time, which would delay the start of construction. After many tests by Zhao Wengang and the technical personnel, a correct ratio was set. The concrete mixed with this ratio not only did not crack, but also the acid resistance and temperature resistance of slag cement were stronger than ordinary cement, which was very suitable for building furnace foundation projects.

    From then on, Zhao Wengang's confidence in studying scientific and technical problems increased, and he understood that to learn science and technology, he should first learn from the Soviet Union and from advanced regions in China. This learning guaranteed the rapid progress of Factory 101's project. Originally, the concrete mix here was based on the British and American volume mix ratio, but after Zhao Wengang learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, he found that this mix ratio was lagging behind the weight mix ratio used in the Soviet Union and some regions in China. The British and American volume mix ratio did not pay attention to the looseness of cement, the amount of water contained in sand, etc., and the accuracy was poor, which affected the compressive strength of concrete, while the weight mix ratio was exactly the opposite, but the specific use of the weight mix ratio still required a series of tests and research. Zhao Wengang began this test and research work with engineers Yuan Shuxun and Xu Wanbang.

    Promoting the Soviet Union's weight mix ratio for technical personnel is not only a technical issue but also an ideological transformation issue, because technical personnel are accustomed to using the British and American volume mix ratio, so once they switch to the weight mix ratio, some resistance is inevitable. Zhao Wengang also often discussed with all the technical personnel, and through the research, everyone gradually realized that the volume mix ratio was indeed outdated and should be replaced with the weight mix ratio or other new methods to improve the quality of concrete.

    The Party and administrative leaders also constantly encouraged Zhao Wengang and everyone's research and experimentation, and pointed out that they should consult experts more. Zhao Wengang once went dozens of miles away to consult civil engineering experts or engineers. The experts saw Zhao Wengang's spirit of research and also enthusiastically put forward their opinions and corrected his formulas. The technical personnel and workers of the factory were even more willing to help Zhao Wengang and them succeed in the experiment.

    With the help of all parties, the weight mix ratio experiment was successful. The compressive strength of the concrete mixed with this method was increased by an average of more than 60%. This not only improved the quality of the project but also saved a large amount of wealth for the country.

    After promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union among technical personnel and workers, everyone realized the superb level of Soviet technology and should learn from the Soviet Union. The construction site of Factory 101 successively improved many engineering designs and construction methods with reference to Soviet experience. For example, the original plan was to use oil felt in the furnace foundation project, which was in accordance with general architectural design. However, after learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, they boldly canceled the oil felt and ensured the quality of the project. This not only saved about 600 million yuan of materials but also shortened the construction period. For another example, regarding the concrete formwork problem, with reference to Soviet experience, the removal period of the formwork was appropriately shortened, which also shortened the entire concrete project by two months. Due to the improvements and innovations in construction, all the project tasks were completed by the end of 1952.

    Zhao Wengang told reporters: "The reason why we were able to complete all the project tasks on schedule this time is primarily because, in accordance with the instructions of the factory Party Committee, we correctly concentrated the wisdom and technology of the technical personnel and workers; secondly, it was the result of learning from the Soviet Union and learning from advanced regions." He also said:

    "This is just a beginning. In the large-scale economic construction in the future, there are still thousands of engineering tasks urgently waiting for us to complete. Therefore, we should learn more humbly." Now, in addition to studying Marxist-Leninist theory, Zhao Wengang is systematically studying Russian, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Although Zhao Wengang's work is very busy and these things are not easy to learn, he is very confident that he will learn them in three to five years. He said, "Chairman Mao said, 'If you delve into it, you can always learn it in a few months, a year or two, or three to five years.'"

    钻进去，总可以学会的
    ——记共产党员赵文刚学习管理工业的成就
    本报记者  商恺
    赵文刚是重庆一○一厂副厂长、党委会委员。当一九五一年十月党委会决定他兼任本厂基本建设处处长时，赵文刚非常愉快地接受了这一光荣任务。赵文刚懂得基本建设是祖国工业化的起点，是共产党员的光荣岗位。
    基本建设工作，对于一个刚从部队转业来的赵文刚说，的确是完全生疏的，甚至连一个极普通的术语也不懂。可是工作却需要着赵文刚立刻熟悉这一业务，熟悉这一业务中的科学技术问题。工程蓝图正等待着他审核签字，各种技术会议正等待着他作结论，各种工程部署正等待着他作决定。有一次在研究制造×吨吊车钢梁技术会议上，有的提出钢板氧割以后应当刨边退火，有的则说不应刨边退火。这虽然是一个很小的问题，但是赵文刚就拿不出自己的主见来，最后只得根据设计人员的意见作了决定。在这种情况下，使赵文刚联想到从前在负责材料供应和财务管理的时期内，曾因为自己不熟悉业务，发生了一些错误。例如有一次就在一张假合同上签了字。赵文刚深刻地体会到：一个共产党员单凭忠诚热情工作是不行的，还必须学会业务技术。否则，不知要在工作中发生多少错误，使国家遭受多大损失。
    赵文刚想过：从一个普通的人，要学成一个专家，的确是一件不容易的事情。但是他还想过自己是一个共产党员。共产党员应该有着对党的事业的无限忠诚和热情，有着虚心向群众学习的精神，有着善于集中群众智慧和技术的方法；在党的经常的正确领导之下，一切困难都可以克服，一切都可以学会。
    这是事实：二十年前，赵文刚是川北一个地主家里的小长工，成天过着牛马般的生活。但在参加革命后，就锻炼成为一个优秀的军事指挥员了。这一段革命斗争历史，有力地鼓舞了赵文刚，使他有信心地去学习一切。他说：“过去能够学会军事斗争，今天也就能够学会工业建设。虽然工业建设比军事斗争复杂，但不是不可以学会的，对于一个共产党员，更是如此。”
    当时一○一厂基本建设的情况是相当混乱的，未经改造过的技术管理人员掌握了领导工作，控制了设计、计划、财务、加工定货、验收等重要部门，与不法资本家勾结起来，盗窃国家财富。因此工程进度非常迟缓，甚至几个月能够完成的平基工程可以拖延到十五个月还没有完成。一○一厂的党委会指示赵文刚应该立即改变上述的混乱情况，保证工程任务提前完成。赵文刚经过思考后，向党保证一九五二年年底可以完成全部工程任务。有人惊奇地说：“这是办不到的事情，在这样短短的时期内，别说修建一○一厂这样复杂的工程，就是简单的厂房也难以修成，过去的平基工程就进行了一年多。”赵文刚懂得单靠少数人的力量确是修建不起来的，可是依靠广大职工群众，加上学习先进经验，一定可以完成工程计划。这正如党委所指示的：“虽然我们不懂技术，但只要我们善于集中广大职工群众的智慧和技术，就可以解决基本建设中一切复杂的技术问题，并提前完成工程任务。”事实上，赵文刚就是这样作的。怎样缩短工期，提前完成工程任务呢？这个问题经赵文刚和技术人员、工人群众研究了多少次以后才解决了。开始，技术人员按照旧的方法，即先修厂房，后修炉子的方法来计算，到一九五二年年底，最快也只能完成厂房修建计划。赵文刚就根据过去两年来许多新建工程中的齐头并进的施工方法，提出了采用厂房、炉子一齐修的方法来保证完成工程任务的问题。这对赵文刚来说是一个新的问题，没有十分把握，所以先在广大职工中酝酿后，正式交大家讨论。同时从各方面启发技术人员来接受这个新的方案。例如，讲“庙和菩萨一齐修”的故事，生动地说明厂房、炉子可以一齐修的道理。经过很多试验、教育工作之后，这一“立体交叉施工法”（和东北的分段平行流水作业法相同）遂为全体职工所接受。这一施工法的实行，为一九五二年完成全部工程任务找到了重要的保证。
    工程中的问题是永远不会完的，也只有不断发现问题，解决问题才能前进。在修基础工程中，发生了混凝土开裂的问题。技术人员和工人群众都没有看到过这样的事情，提不出什么改善的办法来。而赵文刚眼看着工程被迫停止进行，更是着急。赵文刚想：难道就这样被迫停工吗？难道就被这样的困难所压倒吗？不能，他想这样的问题，苏联和东北可能已经解决了。于是他仔细地翻阅研究关于介绍苏联和东北土木建筑经验的书籍和杂志。从这些书中找到了答案：混凝土的开裂，是因为矿渣水泥比一般水泥吸水率大，因此按照一般水灰比例来配合，容易开裂。赵文刚找出开裂原因后，便和技术人员研究矿渣水泥的配合比例。在这过程中，同时反对了一种弃置矿渣水泥，改用一般水泥的错误说法，因为改用一般水泥，不仅要把三千筒矿渣水泥积压起来，而且当时一般水泥还没有，要延误开工。经过赵文刚和技术人员多少次的试验，订出了
    一个正确的比例。用这个比例配合的混凝土，不但不再开裂，而且矿渣水泥的耐酸性和抗温性都比一般水泥要强，很适宜于修建炉基工程。
    从此增加了赵文刚对于研究科学技术问题的信心，而且懂得了要学习科学技术，首先应该向苏联学习，向国内各先进地区学习。这种学习，就保证了一○一厂的工程迅速地前进。本来这里的混凝土的配合是采用英美体积配合比的，但在赵文刚学习苏联先进经验之后，发现这种配合比已落后于苏联及国内某些地区所采用的重量配合比。英美体积配合比不注意水泥的松紧，砂子所含水分多少等等不同，准确性差，就影响了混凝土的压力强度，而重量配合比与此恰恰相反，但具体使用重量配合比，还要经过一番试验研究。赵文刚就和袁树勋、徐万邦两位工程师开始了这个试验研究工作。
    推广苏联的重量配合比，对于技术人员来说，不仅仅是一个技术问题，也是一个思想改造问题，因为技术人员们习惯使用英美体积配合比，所以一旦改用重量配合比时，不免会发生一些抵抗的情绪。赵文刚也就经常和全体技术人员研究，从研究中，使大家逐渐认识体积配合比确已落后，应当改用重量配合比或其他新的方法，改进混凝土的质量。
    党和行政领导方面也不断地鼓励赵文刚和大家的研究试验工作，并指出应当多向专家请教。赵文刚曾为此到几十里地外去请教土木工程专家或工程师。专家们看到赵文刚这种钻研精神，也都热情地提出意见，为他改正公式。而本厂的技术人员、工人群众，则更加愿意帮助赵文刚他们试验成功。
    经过各方面的帮助，重量配合比试验成功了。使用这种方法配合的混凝土的压力强度平均提高百分之六十多。这样不仅提高了工程质量，而且为国家节省了一大笔财富。
    在技术人员和工人群众中推广苏联先进经验之后，使大家认识了苏联技术水平的高超，应向苏联学习，一○一厂工地就陆续参照苏联经验，改进了很多工程设计和施工方法。例如：原计划在炉基工程中使用油毛毡，这是按照一般建筑设计的。但在学习苏联的先进经验后，就大胆地取消了油毛毡，并保证了工程质量。这不仅节省了约六亿元的材料，而且缩短了工期。再如关于混凝土的模板问题，也参照苏联经验，将模板拆除期限适当地缩短，也使整个混凝土工程缩短了两个月。由于在施工上的改进和创造，到一九五二年年底，就完成了全部工程任务。
    赵文刚对记者说：“这次所以能够按期完成全部工程任务，首先是因为按照工厂党委会指示，正确地集中了技术人员、工人群众的智慧和技术；其次是向苏联学习，向先进地区学习的结果。”他又说：
    “这还只是一个开端，在今后大规模的经济建设中，尚有千千万万的工程任务急待我们去完成，因此应更加虚心地去学习。”现在赵文刚除了学习马克思列宁主义理论外，正有计划地学习俄文，学习物理、化学和数学。虽然赵文刚的工作很忙，这些东西又不容易学，但他却十分有信心地要在三、五年内学会。他说：“毛主席就这样说过‘钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。’”
