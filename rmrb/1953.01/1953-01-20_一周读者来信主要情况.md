    Weekly Reader Letters Summary
    From January 4th to 10th, the reader letters group of this newspaper received a total of 1,155 reader letters and 192 letters from various agencies investigating, processing, and responding to readers.
    From these letters, it can be seen that the New Year's Day editorial of this newspaper, "Greeting the Great Tasks of 1953," has already aroused widespread influence among readers. During this week, the number of letters from the masses to the Volunteer Army increased significantly. In order to respond to the call for continuing to strengthen the resistance against America and aiding Korea, the masses not only encourage the Volunteer Army to strive for greater victories with their enthusiasm and the construction of the motherland, but also support the Volunteer Army with practical actions. Wang Daxiang and 25 other teachers from the Shandong Second Revolutionary Disabled Veterans' Accelerated Secondary School donated all of their recently reissued subsidies of 3.78 million yuan to the Volunteer Army; Comrade Tang Kai of the Grain Bureau of the Yong'an County People's Government in Fujian also remitted 480,000 yuan, entrusting this newspaper to transfer it to the Volunteer Army for purchasing reading materials.
    Readers are extremely excited about this historically significant major event of convening the National People's Congress this year. Many readers sent letters expressing their enthusiastic support and raising some related questions requiring answers.
    During this week, we also received 37 letters criticizing and reporting on the infringement of human rights and coercive commandism of district and village cadres; and these letters came from different regions. From this, it can also be seen that this is a common and serious problem that the masses are currently urgently demanding to be resolved.

专栏：读者来信

    一周读者来信主要情况
    一月四日至十日，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信一千一百五十五件、各机关调查处理和答复读者的信一百九十二件。
    从这些来信中可以看出，本报元旦发表的“迎接一九五三年的伟大任务”的社论，已经在读者中引起了广泛的影响。在这一周中，群众给志愿军的信显著增加。为了响应继续加强抗美援朝的号召，群众不仅以自己的热情和祖国的建设来鼓舞志愿军争取更大的胜利，而且以实际行动来支援志愿军。山东省第二革命残废军人速成中学王大襄等二十五位教员，把他们最近补发的津贴三百七十八万元全部赠给志愿军；福建永安县人民政府粮食局唐楷同志也汇来四十八万元，托本报转给志愿军购买读物用。
    对今年召集全国人民代表大会这一有历史意义的重大事件，读者感到万分兴奋。许多读者来信表示热烈拥护，并提出一些有关问题要求解答。
    在这一周中，我们还收到了批评和检举区村干部侵犯人权和强迫命令作风的来信三十七件；而这些信是来自不同的地区。从这里也就可以看出，这是目前群众迫切要求解决的一个普遍的严重的问题。
