The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Wu'an County, Hebei Province branch and the Wu'an County Cooperative, due to leading cadres not regularly paying attention to guiding employees in improving cotton packaging techniques, have caused the already increased cotton loading capacity to gradually decline and accidents to occur continuously.

When new cotton was listed in September 1952, the Wu'an County Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company accepted employees' suggestions to improve the pressing box and standardize cotton bale specifications, thereby increasing the cotton loading capacity. The Handan Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company used this advanced experience to create a new national record of loading 24.31 tons of cotton per vehicle in October of last year. However, after September of last year, the Wu'an County Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Cooperative reduced their loading techniques, and the cotton loading capacity declined month by month. In September, each vehicle averaged 145 bales, weighing 14.185 tons; in October, each vehicle averaged only 141 bales, weighing 13.445 tons; in November, it dropped to an average of 136 bales per vehicle, weighing 13.144 tons; and one vehicle loaded on December 7th was reduced to 104 bales, weighing 10.265 tons, which is back to the level of 1950.

The main reason for the reduction in cotton loading capacity of the Wu'an County Cooperative is that the leading cadres of the cooperative did not educate and urge the packing workers to push and press the opened boxes according to the required specifications. The bale heads were extremely uneven, the iron wires were tied very loosely, and the volume expanded after being pressed, and the sizes were inconsistent (each bale's volume ranged from 0.3808 cubic meters to 0.585675 cubic meters), thus reducing the loading capacity, wasting the country's railway wagons, and increasing transportation costs. At the same time, the leading cadres of the cooperative showed extreme lack of concern for the safety of the workers, resulting in consecutive responsibility accidents of people being injured by springback from the press.

The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Wu'an County branch did not do enough to inspect and help the cooperative, and did not provide sufficient guidance to the packing workers on technical operations. It did not put forward positive improvement methods and effective measures to ensure the safety of workers regarding a series of problems such as broken chains, broken bead bowls, and bouncing covers of the pressing box. The wage problem of the packing workers has not been properly resolved, which has caused some workers to feel uneasy about their work, directly affecting the improvement of packaging technology.

The Wu'an County Cooperative and the Wu'an County branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should quickly find ways to change the above situation. (Jin, Ming)

    河北武安县花纱布公司和合作社
    应该设法提高棉花装载量
    中国花纱布公司河北省武安县公司和武安县合作社，由于领导干部没有经常注意领导职工改进棉花包装技术，致使已经提高了的棉花装载量又逐步下降，而且不断发生事故。
    一九五二年九月新棉上市时，武安县花纱布公司接受职工的建议，改进榨箱、统一棉包规格，提高了棉花装载量。中国花纱布公司邯郸分公司运用这一先进经验，在去年十月份创造了每车装载二四点三一吨棉花的全国新纪录。但是武安县花纱布公司及合作社在去年九月以后，装车技术就降低了，棉花装载量逐月下降。九月份每车平均装一四五包，重一四点一八五吨；十月份每车平均只装一四一包，重一三点四四五吨；十一月份则下降到每车平均装一三六包，重一三点一四四吨，十二月七日装运的一车竟降低到一○四包，重一○点二六五吨，即又回到了一九五○年的水平。
    武安县合作社的棉花装车量降低的主要原因是：该社领导干部没有教育督促打包工人按照要求规格推榨开箱，棉包的包头极不整齐，铁丝扎得很松，放榨后体积扩大，且大小不一（每包体积从○点三八○八立方公尺到○点五八五六七五立方公尺不等），因而降低了装载量，浪费了国家的车皮，增加了运费的支出。同时，该社领导干部对工人的安全极不关心，以致接连发生蹦榨伤人的责任事故。
    中国花纱布公司武安县公司对合作社的检查帮助，对打包工人在技术操作上的指导也做得不够，对榨箱断链、坏珠碗、蹦盖等一系列问题，没有提出积极的改进办法和切实有效的措施，以保证工人安全。对打包工人的工资问题，也一直没有妥善解决，以致引起某些工人工作不安心，直接影响了包装技术的改进。
    武安县合作社和花纱布公司武安县公司应迅速设法改变上述状况。    　（今、明）
