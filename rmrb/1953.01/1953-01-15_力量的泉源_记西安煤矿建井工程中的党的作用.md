    The Source of Strength
    ——On the Role of the Party in the Xi'an Coal Mine Construction Project
    Zhang Zhongliu
    A season of harvest – in the autumn of 1952, on the coalfields beside the Liao River in Northeast China, our country's largest pair of vertical shafts – the central shafts of the Xi'an Coal Mine – were completed. According to British and American technology, this pair of large vertical shafts would have taken nine years; the construction of the shafts alone would have taken four years. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, driven by the selfless labor of Communist Party members and Youth League members and their enthusiastic learning of advanced Soviet experience, the working class created a miracle, completing the shaft construction project in twenty-one months.

    Party Members and Youth League Members as Backbone
    As early as three years ago, after a period of production recovery at the Xi'an Coal Mine, the Liaoyuan Municipal Committee and the Mining Bureau considered the issue of capital construction for the mine. This was because the Liaoyuan basin is rich in bituminous coal – a very good type of coal for industrial use. During the period of Japanese occupation, in order to facilitate plunder, the Japanese used simple inclined shaft mining methods, extracting the upper and middle layers of coal, leaving only the deep coal. To mine the deep coal, one could not rely solely on inclined shafts, but needed to use new methods. Therefore, the Liaoyuan Municipal Committee and the Mining Bureau considered opening new shafts.

    After repeated deliberation, discussion, and instructions from higher authorities, the leading cadres of the Liaoyuan Municipal Committee and the Mining Bureau gradually realized that for the development of the Xi'an Coal Mine and to accelerate the industrialization of the motherland, it was necessary to allocate a large number of cadres and technicians, and to adopt advanced Soviet experience to sink vertical shafts. They recruited a group of technical personnel from other places, and transferred workers from various mines. When a new thing is produced, it is often not easy for people to quickly understand its significance; coupled with the mischief of some departmentalism, some of the workers who were transferred had poor labor discipline. The Liaoyuan Municipal Committee promptly criticized this erroneous practice, and proposed that to sink vertical shafts, it was necessary to "invest capital," to transfer Party members and Youth League members as the backbone, and to transfer young and strong lads to do this work. Subsequently, more than sixty Party members and more than forty Youth League members were transferred from various mines. This included leading cadres such as the highly capable Deputy Mine Director Li Zui.

    The transfer of this group of Party members and Youth League members was also an ideological struggle. After the Liaoyuan Municipal Committee made its decision, some mines did a better job, mobilizing the Party members and Youth League members who were transferred in the first two days; others were perfunctory, only saying to the workers when they were about to go down the mine: "Don't go down, you're being transferred to the vertical shaft training class!" Some mine leaders even had unclear thinking, sending out people who were difficult to lead. In this way, people were transferred, but their thoughts were diverse: some Party members and Youth League members thought: the organization has decided to sink a large shaft, so we must do a good job. Some were willing to learn new technologies. Others did not know what was going on, discussing among themselves: the higher authorities are letting us "study for a year, visit for two years, and go abroad for three years"... Some were even afraid of "earning less money."

    Ideology must be unified, and technology also needs a preliminary understanding. The Liaoyuan Municipal Committee and the Mining Bureau decided: first train this group of Party members and Youth League members before they start working. In the training class, engineers gave technical lectures every day; the Secretary of the Liaoyuan Municipal Committee, the Minister of Propaganda, and several directors of the Mining Bureau gave political lectures separately, repeatedly explaining that sinking vertical shafts was a long-term plan for the country, and although the task was arduous, it was also the most glorious. Who should complete it? Party members and Youth League members must first take responsibility. At the same time, a Party branch was established, organizational life was strictly enforced, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. After everyone understood the significance of the vertical shaft project, the branch also helped solve some practical problems. Everyone was very enthusiastic and full of confidence, unanimously expressing their determination to build a good shaft for the long-term plan of the century. At this time, everyone made a guarantee to the organization. On the letters of guarantee, comrades who understood each other also made mutual guarantees.

    Difficulties Bowed Their Heads Before Them
    Before the formal construction began, the trained Party members and Youth League members arrived at the site. When they arrived, whether they were drillers, electricians, or fitters, they all started digging and carrying soil together. Although some individuals felt "the higher authorities sent us to build a large shaft, why are we doing odd jobs," and expressed dissatisfaction, after the mobilization of the Party branch meeting, the criticism and self-criticism of the group meetings, this emotion immediately disappeared, and also motivated the loose and scattered people who were originally working there.

    On November 22, 1950, the vertical shaft project officially held its groundbreaking ceremony.

    The digging of the shaft began. The tools for digging and drilling were pickaxes, chisels, and hand hammers, and the dirt and rocks were removed with iron shovels, willow baskets, and windlasses. The primitive tools and heavy labor did not matter, and the Party members led the workers to work with increasing enthusiasm. When the shaft was dug six or seven meters deep, water appeared. Water constantly seeped out... But there were not enough oil boots prepared, so the Party members preferred to soak their own feet in the freezing water, giving the oil boots to non-Party workers to wear. The workers were deeply moved, and their work became even more active. The Party members also made suggestions to the administration through the branch, and soon a large number of boots were purchased. When the shaft was dug more than twenty meters deep, it was necessary to pour concrete linings to build brick walls on top. However, thousands of ice columns were frozen on the shaft walls, making it difficult to build the linings. The captain, Party member Li Zui, and the workers racked their brains together and finally came up with the idea of putting a heating package down the shaft. With the heating turned on, the lining construction began.

    While fighting against nature, Party members and Youth League members led the workers to actively learn technology. When building the shaft wall, it was necessary to hang an iron ring first, measure the center line, and then install backing boards. The production team leader of the auxiliary shaft, Party member Zhang Dekuan, the Party group leader Huo Zhenku, and the technician Lu had a very harmonious relationship. They often studied the techniques of hanging iron rings and installing backing boards together. There was a young Party member in the team named Gu Faming, who had followed his father from Guanzhong to this place to escape famine when he was six or seven years old, and had worked in coal mines from a very young age. This life had forged him to be very stubborn and clever. He and another Party member, Cai Guojun, each bought a tape measure, and often measured the specifications of the iron rings and backing boards arranged by the technician. After work, Zhang Dekuan and Huo Zhenku also led the whole team to discuss and study. In this way, they quickly learned the techniques of hanging iron rings and installing backing boards. The Party branch promptly praised their spirit of learning, and suggested that the administration transfer Huo Zhenku to the main shaft to help with work. The technician Fu of the main shaft was a bit different from the technician Lu of the auxiliary shaft. He was unwilling to study technology with the workers. He often said, "I came to the Northeast to get rich!" Once, when the technician Fu came to measure the center line, he was unhappy about something. In a short while, he threw the tape measure three times and became very angry. Party member Wang Yuhua thought, "Isn't this deliberately making trouble? I have to learn how to do it well." Wang Yuhua was only around twenty years old, but had several years of work experience. He had not gone to school, but he was very clever. Soon, he started measuring the center line himself. After Huo Zhenku went to the main shaft, he studied even more actively, and finally created a method of using sidelines to measure when trimming and installing backing boards. In this way, hanging an iron ring could save half an hour.

    Soviet Experts Brought New Methods
    In the spring of 1951, the Soviet expert Comrade Simankov came.

    Gu Faming and others were worried because they could not drill deep enough. When they heard that the Soviet expert had arrived, they quickly ran to ask the cadres, "What is the Soviet elder brother here to do?" The cadres replied, "To see the big shaft." They asked again, "Can he give us some advice?" The answer was, "Don't rush!" The workers and cadres were very excited. The Soviet expert went to the vertical shaft site, inspected the shaft, and made many suggestions. Finally, at the representative meeting of cadres and workers of the vertical shaft project, Comrade Simankov put forward thirty-five suggestions (mainly to implement parallel operations, deep drilling, and the necessary equipment modifications). Comrade Simankov's suggestions shocked everyone. Gu Faming was especially happy to hear that deep drilling was allowed. During the security inspection of the vertical shaft project team, the workers had also made many suggestions about the equipment. The Soviet expert's suggestions for improving the equipment were very much in line with the workers' wishes. They often asked the cadres, "When will our and the expert's suggestions be implemented?" But some individual workers showed indifference. Hu Yubin said, "What advanced experience or not, anyway, I get paid for a day's work." The conservative technicians had even more bizarre remarks. Technician Fu especially went to places with many workers to say, "I have been sinking big shafts all my life, and I have never heard of deep drilling, let alone parallel operations. Is this a joke? If there are people up and down in a shaft, and everyone is working together, if something falls from above, there is no place to run below, and you young lads will be killed!" Technician Du also chimed in, "People die even when sinking a single shaft, you'll know how bad it is if you try it!" Their words affected some people, some did not want to work in the shaft anymore, and some, when working in the shaft, would quickly look up whenever they heard a noise above.

    The Liaoyuan Municipal Committee and the director of the Mining Bureau strongly supported the Soviet expert's suggestions. They personally gave reports, encouraging cadres and Party members: "A new job will always encounter difficulties, and Party members and Youth League members must play a backbone role in overcoming these difficulties." Director Tian, who was in charge of capital construction, also frequently went to the site to provide specific leadership and assistance. Team leader Li Zui said to the branch secretary Li Shouzhen, "We must follow the Soviet expert's advice to the end!" He quickly led cadres and technicians to begin modifying the equipment.

    The branch held an ideological mobilization meeting to promote the parallel operation method, and launched the Party's various groups to展开讨论. At the group meeting of Zhang Dekuan's group, Gu Faming spoke first. He said, "I had a disagreement with Cai Guojun these past two days, which affected the work. Seeing that parallel operations are about to be implemented, I guarantee that I will not quarrel again and will complete the task given by the Party!" Cai Guojun also made a self-criticism: "I have a strong personality and a bad attitude. Old Gu and I are both Party members and group leaders, and it is very bad to quarrel." Then the topic turned to guaranteeing the implementation of parallel operations and deep drilling. After mobilization and discussion, Wang Yuhua's group all understood that single operation would take four years to sink a pair of shafts, while parallel operations would only take two years. They also knew that parallel operations were also safe if the equipment was installed according to the Soviet method. The electromechanical group was composed of Party members from various supporting trades. In the past, production was often affected due to failures of water pumps and pipes. After discussing the significance of parallel operations at this group meeting, they focused on solving the problem of guaranteeing production. The trade union and the Youth League also repeatedly mobilized all the workers. In order to further create conditions for parallel operations, the Party branch decided to launch a labor emulation campaign. At this time, the well flooded with water, water gushing up from the bottom of the well and flowing down from the walls. Even if a water pump was installed, it could not be pumped out. The workers continued to go down the well, wearing two or three raincoats made of oilcloth, but their bodies were soaked through in just two hours. The water was getting bigger and bigger. If the water pump had a slight problem, the water in the shaft would be waist-deep. How could such a large amount of water be used to fire the cannons? Hu Jinxiang, an eighteen-year-old Youth League member, was really "tiger"! He took off his clothes and jumped into the water... Hu Jinxiang was a good young man. He could carry fifteen backing boards when others carried ten, he was even more excellent at using the windlass, and he could also unite with all the workers in the group, so their group often exceeded its task. In terms of the vertical shaft team, the labor of Hu Jinxiang's group was second only to Gu Faming's group.

    The workers' enthusiasm for labor is truly precious! But how to make it more solid and more improved? The Party branch decided to have Gu Faming's group test deep drilling, and lead everyone to continue to move forward. The Party's requirement for the deep drilling test was two meters five. Gu Faming's group accepted this glorious task.

    The deep drilling test began. Gu Faming held the rock drill, staring intently as the drill bit drilled into the rock... Suddenly, the machine body shook and stopped, and the drill bit was clamped by the rock. Gu Faming and everyone tried their best to lift the drill bit, but the drill bit did not move, as if it was growing in the stone. They continued to drill, and the drill bit continued to be clamped. After several hours, the well was like a sorghum field that had just been harvested, filled with drill bits. At this time, another worker was shaken off the stool by the rock drill, and his head was broken and bleeding... Guo Jingu said, "The Soviets drill deep, they are tall, and the rock is hard." Chen Wanxing also chimed in, "The rock is soft, and there is water, how can you drill deep?" Gu Faming also felt a little hesitant. The team leader Li Zui, who had been working with them, encouraged them on the one hand, and decided to let them rest on the well first on the other hand.

    When they came to the well, the branch secretary Li Shouzhen asked Gu Faming as soon as he saw him, "How is it going?" Gu Faming replied anxiously. "It's terrible!" "You are a Communist Party member, you are a group leader, you should have confidence, and persevere to the end! Difficulties can be overcome!" Team leader Li Zui and the trade union chairman Wang Dekui also mobilized the workers: "This test of yours is very important for accepting the Soviet expert's advice, if it doesn't go well, the impact will be very great!" "As long as you use your brains, difficulties can always be overcome!" Gu Faming and the workers' confidence was strengthened, and the young men continued to go down the well and worked for three consecutive shifts. The two-and-a-half-meter hole was finally drilled once (more than eighty holes).

    The workers were very happy, but Technician Fu came to say something strange again. He said, "Don't look at the holes, you can't blast them, how much gunpowder do you have to load for such a deep hole!" "Boom! Boom!" The sound of cannons rang. As soon as the sound of the cannons stopped, Li Zui and Li Shouzhen went down the well to take a look, and it was really neat and good! The facts left Technician Fu speechless.

    The deep drilling test was successful, but one set of holes could not always be drilled for three shifts. Gu Faming thought: I still have to find a way to prevent the drill bits from being clamped. So he was thinking about ways all the time. He even took the rock drill home after work to ponder. He disassembled the machine body and looked at it carefully. When he saw the water pipe, he thought: the rock is already soft, and if you give it water, it will become mud, and of course the drill bit will be clamped. He took out the water pipe. When he tested it the next day, it was a bit "promising", and drilling one and a half meters deep was no longer a problem. Gu Faming was not satisfied with this achievement. He continued to ponder, thinking while eating, walking, and sleeping... One night, he suddenly thought: Usually, the rock powder blocks the drill bit, and people always use iron wire to clear it. Could a spring-type iron wire ring, set in the concave drill bit head, isolate the rock powder? He immediately got up, found a section of iron wire, and bent a spring ring according to the drill bit head he brought back. He couldn't wait to test it, he thought about it all night.

    The next day, when Gu Faming tested it, the iron wire ring worked. It didn't clamp the drill bit even if he drilled two meters deep with the spring ring set on the drill bit head. The workers in their team immediately learned this method. The branch secretary and the team leader attached great importance to this matter, and personally worked with them for a shift to do the test. Sure enough, one shift could drill a set of two-meter-deep holes.

    The Party branch immediately convened a Party member meeting to mobilize everyone to learn from Gu Faming's advanced experience. However, some people were not convinced, saying, "What's so great about this, anyone can make an iron wire ring." "This little thing is worth praising at the Party member meeting. I want to come up with a better method than him." The branch promptly had individual talks with them and criticized their incorrect thinking. The propagandist and the blackboard newspaper also widely publicized Gu Faming's creation.

    Gu Faming's creation greatly increased the drilling speed, which had lagged behind the well-building speed, and made technical preparations for the implementation of parallel operations. At this time, the equipment that had been modified for the implementation of parallel operations was also completed. Three hanging platforms were set up in the well: the first was a fixed hanging platform to protect the well-building; the second platform was the working platform for building the wall; and the third was the protective platform for drilling. Pneumatic winches and traction steady ropes were also installed. Horns were also installed on the hanging platform and the traction steady ropes. This set of equipment ensured the safe parallel operation of the workers. Parallel operations were implemented. Labor efficiency was greatly improved, increasing the original average monthly progress of about ten meters to more than thirty meters. At this time, the Party branch also frequently educated the Party members and workers of the well-building team on safety precautions, and struggled against the idea of ​​not paying attention to safety. And led everyone to change the wooden boards placed on the edge of the hanging platform to sandbags, and then to sawdust bags. The sawdust bags filled the edges of the hanging platform, and it was difficult for things from the well-building team to leak down. Finally, Gu Faming suggested that tools such as large shovels should be tied to the well-building workers with ropes, which could better prevent things from falling down the well.

    At the first award ceremony of the vertical shaft project team, Party member Gu Faming and Huo Zhenku were both selected as labor models; among the thirty-eight meritorious people, twenty were Party members.

    The Season of Harvest Has Arrived
    When Comrade Gao Gang called on all state-owned and public-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast region to increase production and save eight million tons of grain, the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League immediately mobilized all the workers to "find tricks, tap potential, and propose rationalization proposals" to launch a production increase and conservation campaign. Some workers believed that with the implementation of parallel operations, labor efficiency was enough, and it was difficult to find tricks. Party member Gu Faming did not think so. He first proposed the rationalization proposal of "trimming the edges of the shaft by no more than thirty millimeters." In the past, trimming the edges was often too much, and more backing boards had to be installed when hanging the iron rings, and more concrete had to be filled when building the walls, which resulted in wasted labor, wasted materials, and unsafety. The Party branch immediately published Gu Faming's suggestion on the blackboard newspaper and the "Xi'an Worker" newspaper, promoting the production increase and conservation campaign. The workers were all using their brains to find tricks and tap potential, calculating every action in minutes and seconds, and everyone put forward many rationalization proposals. Zhao Yuliang, a young Youth League member in Gu Faming's group, suggested installing iron doors on the air pockets, which reduced the original two-hour work to forty minutes. The production increase and conservation plan was overfulfilled.

    In order to welcome the Red May of 1952, the vertical shaft team launched another production increase and conservation campaign. With the specific help of the Party, the duty captain, Youth League member Fan Baoqin, led the entire class to coordinate with the winch driver, and created three consecutive new records - the highest daily progress of drilling was two point four meters, and one shift produced ninety buckets of dirt and rocks. The blackboard newspaper immediately published the news of "Fan Baoqin's class firing three consecutive cannons," which caused a sensation in the entire vertical shaft project team, and the production increase and conservation campaign was launched enthusiastically again. At this time, the new team leader Ma Jie also helped Gu Faming's group adjust the labor organization and restore the past eye-drilling method that had once been implemented, which improved the eye-drilling efficiency to three hours to drill and fire a set of holes. The main shaft also created a new record of more than fifty-six meters of monthly progress.

    The season of harvest has arrived. In August 1952, the shaft project of the central vertical shaft of the Xi'an Coal Mine was completed fifteen days ahead of schedule according to the new plan.

    力量的泉源
    ——记西安煤矿建井工程中的党的作用
    张中流
    一个收获的季节——一九五二年的秋天，在祖国的东北、辽河岸旁的煤田上，完成了我国最大的一对竖井——西安煤矿中央竖井的井筒工程。这对大竖井工程，如按英美的技术施工，需时九年；光井筒的建设也得四年。但是，在共产党领导下，在共产党员和青年团员忘我地劳动和热情地学习苏联先进经验的带动下，工人阶级创造了奇迹，二十一个月完成了建井工程。
    党员团员作骨干
    远在三年以前，西安煤矿经过了一段恢复生产之后，辽源市委和矿务局就考虑到本矿的基本建设问题了。因为辽源这个盆地，蕴藏着沥青煤——一种很好的工业用煤。在日寇侵占时期，为了便于掠夺，日寇采用了简陋的斜井开采方法，将上层煤和中层煤采完，只留下深部煤。要采深部煤就不能单靠斜井，须用新的方法。因此辽源市委和矿务局考虑到增开新井的问题。
    经过一再酝酿、讨论和上级的指示，辽源市委和矿务局领导干部逐渐认识到：为了西安煤矿的发展，为了加速祖国工业化，必须调配大批干部和技工，并采用苏联先进经验来打竖井。他们一面从外地招请一批技术人员，一面就向各矿抽调工人。一件新的事物产生，人们往往不易很快了解它的意义；再加上若干本位主义思想作怪，所以在抽调出的工人中，就有一些是劳动纪律不好的工人。辽源市委及时地批判了这种错误作法，提出了要打竖井必须要“下本钱”，要调党员、团员作骨干，调年轻力壮的小伙子来作这件事情。接着就从各矿抽调党员六十多名、团员四十多名。其中还包括了能力很强的副矿长李檇等领导干部。
    抽调这一批党员、团员也是一场思想斗争。辽源市委决定下去以后，有的矿作得比较好，头两天就向调出的党员、团员作了动员；有的矿则潦潦草草，临工人下井干活时才说了一下：“别下去了，调你们到竖井训练班呢！”甚至有的矿的负责人思想还不很通，把不好领导的人送出来。这样，人是调出来了，思想却有各种各样：有的党员、团员想：组织决定来打大井，一定好好干。有的是愿意学一些新的技术。也有的还不知道是怎么回事，互相议论着：上级让来“一年学习、二年参观、三年留洋”……。个别的还怕“挣钱少”。
    思想必须统一，技术也需要初步了解。辽源市委和矿务局决定：先将这批党员和团员训练一下，然后再工作。在训练班中，工程师每天去讲技术课；辽源市委书记、宣传部长和几位矿务局长分头去讲政治课，他们反复地说明：打竖井是国家的百年大计，任务虽然艰巨，但也最光荣。谁去完成呢？党员、团员必须首先担当起责任来。同时又成立了党支部，严格了组织生活，展开了批评和自我批评。大家懂得了竖井工程的意义后，支部又帮助解决了一些实际问题。大家劲头非常高，信心非常足，一致表示要把百年大计的大井打好。这时，每个人都向组织提出了保证。在保证书上，互相了解的同志还作了互相保证。
    困难在他们面前低了头
    还没有正式施工，受过训的党员和团员就来到现场。他们一去，不管是凿岩工、电气工、钳工，一起下手挖土、抬土。虽有个别人觉得“上级让来打大井，怎么当了杂工”，表示不满意。但经过党支部大会的动员，小组会的批评和自我批评，这种情绪马上烟消云散了，并把原来在那里工作的松松散散的人也带动起来。
    一九五○年十一月二十二日，竖井工程正式举行了开工典礼。
    开始挖井筒了。掘土、凿岩用的工具是镐头、钎子和手锤，出?石用的是铁铣、柳条筐子和辘轳。原始的工具和粗重的劳动也算不了什么，党员带领着工人干劲越来越大。井筒挖下去六七公尺深，出了水。水不断地渗流出来……可是准备的油靴子还不多，党员宁肯自己的两脚浸在冰冻的水里，把油靴子都让给非党工人穿，工人们深受感动，工作也更积极。党员又通过支部向行政提出了意见，不久大批的靴子买来了。井筒挖下二十多公尺深，需要打混凝土壁座，好向上砌砖。但是，井帮上却冻结了千百条冰柱子，打壁座成了问题。大队长、党员李檇和工人们一起费尽心思研究，才想出把暖气包放下井去。通下了暖气，打壁座的工程开始了。
    和大自然进行斗争的同时，党员和团员带领着工人积极学习技术。砌井壁的时候，先要挂一道铁圈，测量好中心线，然后背背板。副井生产小组长、党员张德宽，党的小组长霍振库和卢技术员关系搞得很协调，他们经常在一起研究挂铁圈、背背板的技术。组里有个年青的党员叫谷发明，他六七岁跟着父亲从关里逃荒到这里，很小就下煤窑作工。这种生活，把他锻炼得非常倔强、聪明。他和另一个党员蔡国君每人买了一条皮尺，常常去量一量技术员安排好的铁圈和背板的规格。下班后，张德宽和霍振库又领导着全组讨论研究。这样他们很快就学会了挂铁圈、背背板的技术。党支部及时表扬了他们的这种学习精神，又建议行政把霍振库调到主井去帮助工作。主井的傅技术员与副井的卢技术员有点不同，他不愿和工人研究技术。他常说：“到东北来就是为了发财！”有一次，傅技术员来测量中心线，不知什么事不合心意，一会工夫，他就扔了三回皮尺，大发脾气。党员王玉华想：“这不是成心捉‘白帽子’吗？可得好好学着干。”王玉华年纪不过二十上下，工龄倒有几年了，没上过学，人却很聪明。不久，他就自己下手测量中心线了。霍振库到主井以后，更加积极钻研，终于创造了刷帮、背背板时用边线测量的办法。这样，挂一道圈，就可以节省半个小时。
    苏联专家带来了新方法
    一九五一年的春天，苏联专家石曼阔同志来了。
    谷发明等人正因为打眼打不深而发愁，一听说苏联专家来了，赶快跑去问干部：“苏联大哥来干什么？”干部回答：“看大井。”又问：“能不能指示咱们点办法？”答：“别忙呵！”工人、干部都非常兴奋。苏联专家到竖井现场，一边到井下检查，一边就提出了很多建议。最后在竖井的干部和工人代表大会上，石曼阔同志提出了三十五条建议（主要是实行平行作业、深打眼和为此而必须的改装设备）。石曼阔同志的建议，震动了每一个人。谷发明一听说让深打眼，更是高兴。竖井工程大队在进行保安大检查时，工人们也曾对设备提出过很多意见。苏联专家改进设备的意见，很合工人的心思。他们常去问干部：“我们和专家的意见，什么时候办？”但是也有个别工人表现了漠不关心。胡玉彬说：“什么先进经验不先进经验，反正干一天活给一天工钱。”保守的技术员的怪话更多。傅技术员特别找工人多的地方去说：“我打了一辈子大井，从来没听说过深打眼，更没听说平行作业。这是闹着玩吗？一个井筒上下有人，上下一齐干，上边掉下一件东西，下边想跑也没地方跑，非把你们这些小伙子砸死不可！”杜技术员也过来帮腔：“单打井还会死人呢，你们试验试验就知道厉害啦！”他们的话，影响了一些人，有的不想再在井下工作，有的在井下干活时，一听见上边有点动静，就赶紧抬起头来看看。
    辽源市委和矿务局局长是竭力支持苏联专家建议的。他们亲自作报告，鼓励干部和党员：“一件新工作总要遇到困难，党员、团员要起骨干作用克服这些困难。”负责领导基本建设的田局长还经常到现场进行具体领导和帮助。大队长李檇对支部书记李守珍说：“我们一定要按照苏联专家的意见干到底！”他就很快领导干部、技术人员着手改装设备。
    支部为了推行平行作业法召开了思想动员大会，又发动党的各小组展开讨论。在张德宽小组的小组会上，谷发明第一个发言。他说“这两天我和蔡国君闹意见，使工作受了影响。眼看要实行平行作业了，我保证再不闹意见，好好完成党给的任务！”蔡国君也作检讨：“自己个性强，态度不好，我和老谷都是党员、都是组长，闹意见是很不好的。”接着话题就转向保证实行平行作业和深打眼上去。王玉华小组经过动员和讨论，都懂得了：单行作业一对井要打四年，平行作业只须二年。也知道：按照苏联方法设备，平行作业也很安全。机电小组是由各种配合工种中的党员组成的。过去常常因为水泵、管子出故障影响生产，他们这次小组会在讨论了平行作业的意义后，着重解决了保证生产的问题。工会、青年团也反复向全体工人进行了动员。为着进一步给平行作业创造条件，党支部决定开展劳动竞赛。正在这个时候，井里来了大水，水从井底向上冒，又从井帮上向下流，按上水泵抽也抽不尽。工人照常下井，油布的雨衣穿上两三件，只两个钟头，身上就湿透了。水却越来越大了，水泵稍微有点毛病，井筒里的水就齐腰深。这大的水怎么打连炮呢？十八岁的青年团员胡金祥真“虎”呵！他脱了衣裳就跳进水里去……胡金祥是一个好小伙子，人家背十块背板，他能背十五块，使唤风镐更出色，又能很好团结全组工友，所以他们小组常常超过任务。在竖井大队来说，胡金祥小组的劳动仅次于谷发明小组。
    工人劳动热情真是宝贵呵！但怎样使它更巩固更提高呢？党支部决定谷发明小组试验深打眼，带动大家继续前进。党提出试验打眼的要求是两公尺五。谷发明小组接受了这个光荣的任务。
    开始试验打深眼了。谷发明抱着凿岩机，目不转睛地看着钎子向岩石里钻……忽然，机身一幌就不动了，钎子被岩石夹住了。谷发明和大伙想尽办法起钎子，钎子一动不动像长在石头里一样。他们接着打，钎子接着夹。几个钟头过去，井里像刚收割过的高粱地，插满了钎子。这时候，有一个工人又被凿岩机从凳子上震下来，摔得头破血流。……郭金贵就说：“苏联打深眼，人家人高，岩石硬。”陈万兴也接过来说：“岩石软，还有水，怎么能打深眼？”谷发明心里也有点踌躇。一直和他们一起顶班的大队长李檇，一方面鼓励他们，一方面决定他们先上井休息一下。
    上井来，支部书记李守珍一见谷发明就问：“怎么样？”谷发明焦急地回答。“够呛！”“你是共产党员，你是组长，你应该有信心，坚持干到底！困难是可以克服的！”大队长李檇和工会主席王德奎也向工人进行动员：“你们这回试验，对接受苏联专家意见有很大关系，搞不好，影响很大！”“只要开动脑筋，困难总是可以克服的！”谷发明和工人们信心增强了，小伙子接着下井去，一连干了三个小班。两公尺五的眼终于打了一遍（八十多个）。
    工人非常高兴，傅技术员却又来讲怪话了。他说：“别看眼打成，也崩不成，那么深得装多少火药呵！”“轰！轰！”炮声响了。炮声刚停，李檇和李守珍下井去一看，崩得真齐真好呵！事实使傅技术员哑口无言。
    深打眼试验成功，可是一遍眼不能总打三个小班呵，谷发明想：还得想法不夹钎子才行。于是他时时刻刻在想办法。下班后还抱着凿岩机捉摸。他把机身拆开，仔细地看，看见水管，他想：岩石本来就软，再一给水，就合了泥，当然要夹钎子。他把水管取出来。第二天一试验，有点“门”，打一公尺五深眼再不成问题。谷发明并没有满足这点成绩。他继续捉摸，吃饭、走路、睡觉都在想……一个夜里，他忽然想到：平常岩石粉堵住钎子，总用铁丝通通，弄个弹簧式的铁丝圈，套在窝形钎子头里，能不能隔住岩石粉呢？他立刻爬起来，找了一节铁丝，比着带回来的钎子头，弯了个弹簧圈。他恨不得马上就去试验，他整整地想了一夜。
    第二天，谷发明一试验，铁丝圈就是管用，垫在钎子头上打两公尺深也不夹钎子了。他们小组的工人马上都学习了这个办法。支部书记和大队长很重视这件事，又亲自和他们一起顶班作了试验，果然，一个小班能打一遍两公尺深的眼。
    党支部马上召开党员大会，动员大家学习谷发明的先进经验。可是也有人不服气，说：“这有什么了不起，一个铁丝圈，谁不会做。”“这点事还值得在党员大会上表扬，我想个办法得比他强。”支部及时和他们作了个别谈话，批判了他们的这种不正确思想。宣传员和黑板报上也广泛地宣传了谷发明的创造。
    谷发明的创造使得落后于砌井速度的凿岩速度大大提高，为实行平行作业作好了技术准备。这时为实行平行作业而改装的设备也搞好了。一个井里设有三个吊盘：第一个是固定吊盘，保护砌井的；第二个盘是砌壁的工作盘；第三个是凿岩的保护盘。还装设了气力绞车、牵引稳绳。在吊盘和牵引稳绳上还按装了喇叭口。这套设备保证了工人安全进行平行作业。平行作业实行了。劳动效率大大提高，使得原来平均月进十公尺左右的进度，提高到三十公尺以上。这时党支部又经常向砌井队党员和工人进行注意安全的教育，向不注意安全的思想进行斗争。并领导大家把吊盘边缝上放的木板，改成沙土口袋，以后又改成锯末口袋。锯末口袋把吊盘边缘堵满了，砌井队的东西很难漏下去。最后谷发明又建议把大铲等工具都用绳子拴在砌井的工人身上，更可以防止东西掉下井去。
    在第一次竖井工程大队的评奖大会上，党员谷发明和霍振库都被选为劳动模范；三十八名功臣中，就有二十名是党员。
    收获的季节来到了
    当高岗同志号召全东北区国营公营工矿企业部门增产节约八百万吨粮食的时候，党、行政、工会、青年团马上动员全体工人“找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议”开展增产节约运动。有的工人认为：实行了平行作业，劳动效率够火候了，窍门难找。党员谷发明可不这样想，他首先提出了“刷帮不超过三十米毛（公厘）”的合理化建议。过去刷帮常常刷的多，挂上铁圈就要多背背板，砌壁又要多填混凝土，结果是又费工又费料还不安全。党支部马上把谷发明的建议登在黑板报上、“西安工人”报上，推动了增产节约运动。工人们都开动着脑筋找窍门、找潜力，每个动作都以分、秒来计算，大家又提出了很多合理化建议。谷发明小组的青年、党员赵玉良建议在风包上安上铁门，这样使原来需要两小时的工作缩到四十分钟。增产节约计划超额完成了。
    为了迎接一九五二年的红五月，竖井大队又开展增产节约运动。在党的具体帮助下，值班队长，青年团员范宝勤带动全班和绞车司机联络好，三次连创新纪录——凿岩最高日进二点四公尺，一个小班出九十桶?石。黑板报上马上登出来“范宝勤班连打三炮”的消息，全竖井工程大队轰动了，增产节约运动又热烈地展开了。这时新的大队长马竭又帮助谷发明小组调整了劳动组织，恢复过去一度实行过的流水打眼法，使打眼效率又提高到三小时打一遍眼、放一遍炮。主井也创造了月进五十六公尺多的新纪录。
    收获的季节到来了，一九五二年八月，西安煤矿中央竖井的井筒工程，按照新的计划又提前十五天完成了。
