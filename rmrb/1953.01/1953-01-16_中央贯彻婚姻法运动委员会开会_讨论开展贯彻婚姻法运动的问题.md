Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law was formally established in Beijing on the 14th and held its first meeting of committee members to discuss how to launch a movement to implement the Marriage Law. Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director, explained the current situation of the implementation of the Marriage Law nationwide and the significance of launching a movement to implement the Marriage Law. He said: Since the Central People's Government promulgated the Marriage Law in May 1950 and the Government Administration Council issued instructions in September 1951 on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the Marriage Law throughout the country. However, development in various regions is uneven. There are good regions and poor regions, and the main reason for the success or failure lies in whether the cadres seriously value the implementation of the Marriage Law. At present, in most parts of the country, because cadres do not sufficiently recognize the implementation of the Marriage Law as a major social reform, they only regard it as a temporary task; or they think it is only a matter for women's organizations and let it drift; or they lack a correct and comprehensive understanding of the Marriage Law, and therefore cannot seriously and correctly publicize the Marriage Law and handle marriage disputes; some cadres even take a resistant attitude towards the implementation of the Marriage Law, support feudal evils, and interfere with freedom of marriage. As a result, in these areas, arranged and mercenary marriages are still very popular, freedom of marriage is still interfered with, women are oppressed and abused, and even phenomena of suicide or murder due to lack of marital freedom still exist seriously. Most of the deceased are young and middle-aged, and most of them are women. The cruelty of some of the abuse of women is simply appalling. This phenomenon is intolerable. Liu Jingfan said: In the past two years, due to being busy with a series of major political movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, we have not had time to carry out a large-scale movement to implement the Marriage Law; but now that various social reform movements have basically ended and large-scale national economic construction is beginning, in order to fundamentally destroy the feudal marriage system, eliminate arranged and mercenary marriages, abuse of women, and deaths due to lack of marital freedom, establish a new democratic marriage system of equality between men and women and freedom of marriage, thereby establishing a democratic, harmonious, and united new-style family for production, and to ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction, it is necessary to launch a large-scale mass movement to publicize the Marriage Law and inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law. It has now been decided that March of this year will be the movement month for publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. During this month, all parts of the country, except for ethnic minority areas and areas where land reform has not yet been completed, must take the movement to implement the Marriage Law and reform the feudal marriage system as the central task of this month. It is imperative to make the Marriage Law known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, thereby changing customs and transforming social traditions.
The meeting discussed in detail the nature, principles, and methods of the movement to implement the Marriage Law.
Attending the meeting were Liu Jingfan, He Xiangning, Peng Zemin, Deputy Directors of the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law, Yang Zhihua, Cao Mengjun, Hu Keshi, Deputy Secretaries-General, and members Wang Yunsheng, Li Chang, Li Wenyi, Li Jiansheng, Wu Xinyu, Shao Zonghan, Hu Yaobang, Xu Zirong, Xu Guangping, Zhang Yun, Liang Xi, Yang Weiyu, Lei Jieqiong, Liu Qingyang, Deng Tuo, Qian Ying, Tan Tiwu, Yan Xichun and other twenty-four people.
Furthermore: In order to specifically lead and promote the upcoming large-scale national movement to implement the Marriage Law, the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law has established an office, which will begin operating immediately.

    中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会开会
    讨论开展贯彻婚姻法运动的问题
    【新华社十五日讯】中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会十四日在北京正式成立，并举行第一次委员会议，讨论如何开展贯彻婚姻法运动的问题。刘景范副主任在会上说明了目前全国贯彻婚姻法的情况和开展贯彻婚姻法运动的意义。他说：自从中央人民政府在一九五○年五月公布了婚姻法，政务院在一九五一年九月又发布了关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示以来，全国各地在贯彻婚姻法的工作上，有了不少的成绩；但各地发展是不平衡的，有好的地区，也有差的地区，而成绩好坏的主要原因则在于干部对贯彻婚姻法的工作是否认真重视。目前在全国大部分地区内，由于干部对于贯彻婚姻法是一项重大的社会改革认识不足，只把它作为临时任务；或认为只是妇女团体的事，任其自流；或对婚姻法缺乏正确的全面的了解，因而也不能严肃地正确地宣传婚姻法与处理婚姻纠纷；甚至有些干部对贯彻婚姻法采取抗拒态度，支持封建恶习，干涉婚姻自由，结果，在这些地区，包办买卖婚姻仍很流行，婚姻自由仍被干涉，妇女受压迫，受虐待，甚至为婚姻不自由而自杀或被杀的现象依然严重存在。死者中多是青壮年，而且大部分是妇女。有些虐待妇女的残忍程度简直骇人听闻。这种现象是不能容忍的。刘景范说：过去两年多来，由于忙于土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”等一系列的重大政治运动，我们还来不及进行一次贯彻婚姻法的大规模运动；但现在各项社会改革运动已基本结束，国家大规模经济建设正在开始，为了根本摧垮封建主义的婚姻制度，消除包办买卖婚姻、虐待妇女和因婚姻不自由而死人的现象，树立男女平等、婚姻自由的新民主主义婚姻制度，从而建立民主和睦，团结生产的新式家庭，以保证国家经济建设的顺利进行，就必须开展一个大规模的宣传婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行情况的群众运动。现在，决定以今年三月为宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动月，在这个月内，全国各地除少数民族地区和尚未完成土地改革的地区外，都要以贯彻实施婚姻法、改革封建婚姻制度的运动作为这一个月的中心工作，一定要使婚姻法家喻户晓，深入人心，从而改变风气，移风易俗。
    会议详细讨论了贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、方针、方法等问题。
    出席这次会议的有中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会副主任刘景范、何香凝、彭泽民，副秘书长杨之华、曹孟君、胡克实，委员王芸生、李昌、李文宜、李健生、武新宇、邵宗汉、胡耀邦、徐子荣、许广平、章蕴、梁希、杨卫玉、雷洁琼、刘清扬、邓拓、钱瑛、谭惕吾、严希纯等二十四人。
    又讯：为了具体领导与推动即将到来的全国大规模贯彻婚姻法运动，中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会已成立办公室，即日开始办公。
