    Petőfi Sándor
    Sun Yong
    Petőfi Sándor, Hungary's greatest poet, was born on January 1, 1823. His original surname was Petrovics, which he changed himself to Petőfi. His father was a butcher who later went bankrupt. Unable to settle down to study, he had to wander the vast world. He sang in operas, served as a soldier, and finally became a writer. His ideal was to declare war on the old society. A short poem translated by Mr. Lu Xun is enough to illustrate this point:
    Since childhood, dear father,
    Your honest mouth advised me, very earnestly,
    To be like you, a slaughterer of beasts—
    But your son became a writer.
    You used your tools to strike cattle,
    My gentle brush battles against people—
    All that is done is just this,
    Only the names are different.
    His literary life was not comfortable. After writing for a period, he became a wandering artist again. From 1844 onwards, his works were published one after another, and he also gained world fame. However, he was not happy, because he was concerned about the future of his motherland and longed for the freedom of the world; at that time, Hungary was under the yoke of Austria, and he wanted to break free from these chains:
    If the enslaved nation one day,
    Rises up to resist, to break free from chains,
    Finally responds under the battle flag
    To the call of this great era:
    Freedom for the whole world!
    It will roar across the entire globe
    In a hundred bloody battles—
    The final judgment for the tyrants;
    I only wish to die
    On such a battlefield!
    Not only this concern and longing, but also the "Hungarian nobles" who angered him, enjoying privileges and riding on the heads of the people. Petőfi sang out passionate satirical songs to them without mercy:
    No need to work, living happily every day,
    This makes me most satisfied.
    Only the lowly work without ceasing,
    Because I am a noble!
    You are a farmer, you should suffer,
    You should serve me.
    But I ride a horse and parade around,
    Because I am a noble!
    ……………………
    ……………………
    If the motherland suffers disaster,
    I don't care about it, not at all.
    There must be light after darkness—
    Because I am a noble!
    The old house is filled with smoke,
    I breathe my last breath,
    And angels will take me to heaven…
    Because I am a noble!
    In March 1848, the War of Independence broke out, and Petőfi wrote "Rise Up, Hungarians!" to encourage his countrymen to resist the Austrian rulers. Its first verse is:
    Rise up, Hungarians!
    Rise up!
    For the independence of the motherland!
    We must make a decision:
    Do we want freedom,
    Or to be slaves?
    Pray to the God of Hungary:
    Swear never to be slaves again!
    In October, he joined this war for freedom, and on July 31 of the following year, he died in battle at Segesvár, fulfilling the prophecy of his poem:
    The nightingale sings passionately of war—
    The trumpet on the battlefield. I am at the front, and blood-red flowers of death have grown in my heart. At that time, I fell from the saddle, I was unconscious, you kissed me, my beautiful "Freedom," glorious heavenly fairy! (Attached picture)

    裴多菲·山陀尔
    孙用
    裴多菲·山陀尔，匈牙利最伟大的诗人，生于一八二三年一月一日，原来的姓氏是裴德罗维支，他自己改成了裴多菲。他的父亲是一个屠户，后来破产了；他不能安心读书，只好流浪到广大的世间去。他唱过戏，当过兵，终于成了文人。他的理想是：向旧社会宣战。鲁迅先生所译的一首短诗就足以说明他的这一点：
    从幼小以来，亲爱的父亲，
    你的诚实的嘴嘱咐我，很谆谆，
    要我该像你似的，做一个屠兽者—
    但你的儿子却成了文人。
    你用了你的家伙击牛，
    我的柔翰却向人们开仗—
    所做的都就是这个，
    单是那名称两样。
    他的文学生活，并不安适，写作了一个时期，又去做流浪的艺人了。从一八四四年起，他的作品才陆续出版，而且也有了世界的名声。然而他并不幸福，因为他关心着祖国的未来，渴望着世界的自由；其时的匈牙利是在奥国的羁轭之下的，他要挣脱这铁链：
    假如奴隶的民族有一天，
    起来反抗，要挣脱铁链，
    终于在战旗之下响应
    这伟大的时代的呼声：
    全世界的自由！
    它要在全地球
    咆哮着，作一百次血战——
    给暴君的最后的审判；
    我只愿意死亡
    在这样的战场！
    不仅这关心和渴望，而且还有使他愤怒的“匈牙利的贵人”，他们享有特权，骑在民众的头上。裴多菲毫不容情地对他们唱出了热烈的讽刺的歌声：
    无须工作，欢乐地度日，
    这就使我最满意。
    只有贱人才工作不停，
    因为我是一位贵人！
    你是农夫，你应当吃苦，
    你应当替我服务。
    我却骑着马游行，
    因为我是一位贵人！
    ……………………
    ……………………
    假如祖国遭到了灾难，
    我若无其事，一概不管。
    黑暗之后一定有光明——
    因为我是一位贵人！
    老屋中弥漫着烟气，
    我吐出了最后的呼吸，
    就有天使带我到天庭……
    因为我是一位贵人！
    一八四八年三月，独立战争爆发了，裴多菲写了“起来，匈牙利人！”，鼓动他的国人，反抗奥国的统治者。它的第一节是：
    起来，匈牙利人！
    起来！
    为了祖国的独立！
    我们要下决心：
    还是要自由，
    还是做奴隶？
    向匈牙利的神祷告：
    誓不再做奴隶！
    到了十月，他就参加了这争取自由的战争，第二年七月三十一日在瑟格斯伐尔阵亡，实践了他的诗的预言：
    热烈地歌唱着战争的夜莺——
    这战场上的喇叭。我在前线，我的心头长出了死亡的血的红花。那时候，我从马鞍上倒下，我已经昏迷不醒，你吻着我，你美丽的“自由”，光荣的天上的仙人！（附图片）
