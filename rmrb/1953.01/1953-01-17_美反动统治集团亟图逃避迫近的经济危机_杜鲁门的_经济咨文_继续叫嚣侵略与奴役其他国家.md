Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from New York: Despite the accelerating war production machine, the economic crisis in the United States is maturing day by day. Even the American bourgeoisie cannot conceal their worries about this. The American ruling clique is planning an even more frantic arms race in an attempt to escape the impending crisis.

Although the representatives and newspapers of the American bourgeoisie have been trying their best to promote so-called "unprecedented prosperity" recently, the myth of "permanent prosperity" has been replaced by various gloomy predictions about the economic future. The November 28th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine stated that "a business recession" is bound to occur, "as for when, the best guess now is that it will begin in mid-1953, and will definitely be in full swing by 1954." The editors of "Fortune," another influential magazine of a large American enterprise, answered the question "What does the future hold for us?" in the January 5th issue of "Life," another large-circulation business magazine, concluding that: Economic activity in early 1953 "may reach record levels, but there may be a moderate decline in the summer." They also said that this "decline" "may be longer than the one in 1949," and that in 1954, the situation will "get worse." Although "Newsweek" kept nagging to prove to readers that 1953 would still maintain "prosperity," it dared not mention what would happen after that. Edwin George of the Dunn & Bradstreet Statistical Institute was even more content to predict that there would be no problems in the first half of 1953. However, Dr. Julius Backman of New York University frankly said that in 1953, "we will see businesses begin to decline, and will decline by 10 percent, continuing until the end of 1954." They all expressed these opinions at a discussion meeting of a group of economists held by the U.S. National Industrial Conference Board in late last month.

It is particularly noteworthy that what has already happened in American agriculture, American official news and big business newspapers always talk lightly about the phenomenon of falling prices of agricultural products or simply avoid mentioning it. In fact, American agriculture is already experiencing a crisis of "surplus." According to the index released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by mid-December last year, agricultural product prices had fallen for the fourth consecutive month, falling to 12 percent lower than in December 1951. Melvin Smith, an agricultural economist at Ohio State University, admitted that the fall in agricultural product prices was due to the shrinking of foreign markets and "the abnormal demands after the outbreak of the Korean War gradually decreased." He said that unless foreign markets are increased, agricultural product prices will fall further.

Faced with the crisis that is about to come, the American ruling clique is planning to rely more on large-scale military production to maintain business activity. In the words of the U.S. "Business Daily," it is to continue to "use the same stimulus that is getting stronger and stronger." "The Wall Street Journal" specifically mentioned the necessity of continuing the Korean War, saying that it saw in the Korean War "the possibility of expanding this country's (the United States) defense program."

Fuller, the director of the U.S. "Defense Mobilization Agency," said in a quarterly report to Truman at the end of 1952 that a "general mobilization" plan is being drafted. This plan is to "reduce the civilian economy to a minimum" and require the American people to provide more "contributions" than during World War II. This plan will require "new laws and funding" to build "factories that are not needed today and may never be needed," to establish warehouses to store manufactured machines and machine tools that are "not used," so that the government will pay the costs required to maintain and restore the production of factories that have reduced or closed down due to the lack of outlets for their products. This "general mobilization" plan will be approved in April. Fuller's report nakedly exposes the government of American monopoly capitalists, who will rely on this kind of war mobilization to drain the blood and sweat of the American people to ensure the maximum profits of the monopoly capitalists.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Washington: The outgoing U.S. President Truman submitted his last economic message to the U.S. Congress on January 14th. In this message, Truman once again vigorously boasted about the artificial "prosperity" created by the United States by continuously expanding war production, and emphasized that in order to maintain this "prosperity," the United States should continue to pursue a policy of aggression using military and economic power to plunder and enslave other countries.

While Truman was boasting about the high tone that the United States is currently in a "prosperous situation," he had to simultaneously issue a "warning" that to "maintain a stable economy in the future," much effort is still required, because there are "imbalances and weaknesses" in the U.S. war economy. He also said that there are still other "shortcomings" in the American economy, namely: "the unfavorable trend of agricultural income," "the recent lack of opportunities for small businesses" and "the low wages of unskilled workers." He also acknowledged a fact: Although the Truman government has guaranteed American monopoly capital tens of billions of dollars in profits every year, a quarter of the nation's families now have an annual income of less than two thousand dollars, which is less than half of the minimum standard of living expenses officially stated by the United States. Truman did not talk about how to immediately change this situation, but instead made a ridiculous promise to the tens of millions of American families whose incomes are not enough to meet the minimum standard of living: "It is possible to raise all families that currently have an annual income of less than four thousand dollars to this level within ten years."

Truman also said that in order to maintain this "prosperity" that is highly profitable for capitalists, "the government must take vigorous and foresighted actions." The main point of the "actions" that Truman cited is to continue the arms race and war preparations of the entire imperialist camp. To this end, Truman advocated continuing "military and economic assistance" to other capitalist countries. He particularly mentioned the importance of assistance to so-called "backward areas," saying that this would enable the United States to "benefit, and the supply of many raw materials will increase, including extremely important strategic metals."

    美反动统治集团亟图逃避迫近的经济危机
    杜鲁门的“经济咨文”继续叫嚣侵略与奴役其他国家
    【新华社十六日讯】纽约消息：尽管战争生产机器在加速开动，美国国内的经济危机仍日趋成熟中。这一点，连美国资产阶级也掩盖不住他们的忧虑。美国统治集团正在策划更疯狂的军备运动，企图借此逃避迫近的危机。
    美国资产阶级的代表和报刊近来虽然还在竭力宣扬什么“空前的繁荣”，但是关于“永久的繁荣”的神话却被关于经济前途的种种黯淡预测所代替了。十一月二十八日的“美国新闻与世界报导”杂志说，“企业衰退”必然要发生，“至于什么时候，现在最好的猜测是一九五三年年中开始，到一九五四年肯定地将全面呈现。”另一家美国大企业的有影响的杂志“幸福”的编辑们，在又一家销路很大的大企业杂志“生活”的一月五日一期上回答“今后我们的前途怎样？”的问题，结论是：一九五三年“年初的经济活动可能达到创记录的水平，但夏季可能有和缓的衰落。”他们并说，这次“衰落”，“时间可能比一九四九年的为长”，而且在一九五四年，情况还会“变得坏一些”。“新闻周刊”虽然唠唠叨叨地要向读者证明一九五三年仍将保持“繁荣”，但却不敢提到再往后怎么样。邓·布列德斯特里统计所的埃德温·乔治更只满足于预言一九五三年上半年不会发生问题。而纽约大学的朱丽斯·巴克门博士却直率地说在一九五三年就“会看到企业开始衰退，并将衰退百分之十，一直继续到一九五四年年底。”他们都是在上月下旬美国全国工业会议召开的一批经济学家的讨论会上发表了这些意见。
    特别值得注意的是美国农业中间已经发生的现象，美国官方新闻和大企业的报刊总是轻描淡写地谈到农产品价格下跌的现象或是干脆避而不谈。实际上美国的农业已在经历着“过剩”的危机。据美国农业部公布的指数，到去年十二月中，农产品价格已连续第四个月下跌，跌到比一九五一年十二月低百分之十二。俄亥俄州立大学农业经济学家墨尔文·史密斯承认，农产品的跌价是因为国外市场的缩小和“朝鲜战争爆发后的不正常的要求逐渐减少了”。他说，除非增加国外市场，否则农产品价格还要进一步跌落。
    面对着眼看就要到来的危机，美国统治集团正打算更加依靠大规模的军事生产来维持企业活动。用美国“商务日报”的话来说，就是继续“利用越来越强烈的同一个刺激剂”。“华尔街日报”特别提到继续朝鲜战争的必要，说它在朝鲜战争中看到了
    “扩大这个国家（美国）国防计划的可能性”。
    美国“国防动员署”署长富勒在一九五二年年底向杜鲁门提出的季度报告中说，一个“总动员”的计划正在草拟中，这个计划是要“把民用经济削减到最低限度”，并要求美国人民提供比第二次大战时还要多的“贡献”。这个计划将需要“新的法律和经费”，来建造“今日不需要的，也许永远不会需要的工厂”，建立仓库以储藏制造出来而“不用的”机器和工作母机，以至于由政府来支付维持和恢复因为产品没有出路而减产或停闭的工厂的生产所需的费用。这个“总动员”计划将在四月批好。富勒的这个报告赤裸裸地暴露美国垄断资本家的政府，将依靠这种战争动员来榨尽美国人民的血汗，以保证垄断资本家的最大利润。
    【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：行将下台的美国总统杜鲁门在一月十四日向美国国会提出他的最后一次的经济咨文。杜鲁门在这篇咨文中又大肆吹嘘美国借不断扩大战争生产所制造的人工“繁荣”，并且强调，为了维持这种“繁荣”，美国在今后应继续奉行用军事与经济力量来掠夺和奴役其他国家的侵略政策。
    杜鲁门在大吹其美国目前正处于“繁荣情况”的高调时，却不得不同时提出“警告”说，要“在将来维持稳定的经济”，还要作很多的努力，因为美国的战争经济中存在着“不平衡的现象和弱点”。他又说，美国经济中还存在着其他一些“缺点”，就是：“农业收入的不利的趋势”，“最近小企业比较缺乏机会”和“不熟练工人工资菲薄”。他还承认了一个事实：虽然杜鲁门政府保证了美国垄断资本每年好几百亿美元的利润，但全国四分之一的家庭现在全年收入不到二千美元，即不到美国官方所说的最低标准生活所需费用的一半。杜鲁门不谈怎样立刻改变这个形势，却向成千万收入不够最低生活水平的美国家庭提出了一个可笑的诺言：“在十年内，把所有目前每年收入不到四千美元的家庭提高到这个水平是可能的。”
    杜鲁门又说，为了保持对资本家利市百倍的这个“繁荣”，要“政府采取有力的、有先见的行动”。杜鲁门举出的“行动”的主要一点就是继续整个帝国主义阵营的扩军备战。为此，杜鲁门主张继续对其他资本主义国家的“军事与经济援助”，他特别提到对于所谓“落后地区”的援助的重要性，说这将使美国“可以得到好处，许多原料供应都会增加，包括极顶重要的战略金属。”
