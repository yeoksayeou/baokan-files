    To coordinate with large-scale economic construction, establish a scientific statistical system
    – Concluding Report at the National Statistical Work Conference
    Xue Muqiao, Director of the State Statistical Bureau

The National Statistical Work Conference is about to close. In this conference, we discussed how to establish scientific statistical work in coordination with large-scale economic construction, discussed the 1953 statistical work outline and work plan, and proposed specific plans to strengthen statistical institutions and statistical work. Vice Chairman Zhu also gave us valuable instructions before the closing. Therefore, everyone has a relatively clear and fairly consistent understanding of how to establish statistical work and the specific tasks of statistical work in the future. This is a very important achievement. This achievement is particularly important because China's statistical work is still in its initial stage, and many statistical cadres are new to statistical work. In this initial period, a consistent understanding of the guiding principles and tasks is of particular importance. It enables us to act in unison and rapidly establish this new and scientific statistical work throughout the country.

Large-scale economic construction is about to begin nationwide. As everyone knows, if we want to carry out large-scale economic construction, we must have a correct economic construction plan that fully conforms to the development of the social economy; and statistical work is the foundation of planning work. Without correct statistics, it is impossible to formulate correct economic construction plans, nor is it possible to check the completion of plans in a timely manner. Therefore, strengthening statistical work is one of the necessary conditions for welcoming large-scale economic construction.

To establish scientific statistical work, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in accordance with China's specific conditions, and establish a systematic statistical system and statistical methods under the unified leadership of the Central Government. Why must our statistical work be under the unified leadership of the Central Government? This is because our planning work is unified nationwide, so the statistical work, which is the basis of planning work, must also be unified nationwide. As everyone knows, our economic construction must have a unified national plan; we cannot have each region developing its own plan. Especially in large-scale economic construction, every large factory produces according to the needs of the whole country, and every large construction project must not only take into account the needs of the whole country, but also the needs of three, five, or even ten years later. This can only be achieved through the unified control of the central leading organs. Since construction plans are to be uniformly stipulated by the Central Government, the statistical data needed for formulating construction plans and checking the completion of plans must naturally also be national in scope. If each region formulates its own survey and statistical plan, the statistical data from each region will inevitably be impossible to synthesize and compare nationwide due to different survey scopes, different form indicators, different classification methods, and different calculation methods. Therefore, it cannot serve as the basis for formulating a national construction plan. In order for our statistical data to be synthesized and compared nationwide, the State Statistical Bureau must issue uniform national statistical reports. The survey scope, form indicators, classification methods, and calculation methods of these reports must not only be unified nationwide, but also be completely consistent with those of the planning departments; otherwise, they will not be able to meet the needs of the planning departments, nor will they be able to check the completion of plans. Therefore, statistical work must be under the unified leadership of the Central Government.

Another important significance of the unified leadership of statistical work is the planned utilization of existing statistical forces to ensure the solid completion of national statistical tasks. If governments at all levels and various business departments can issue survey and statistical forms independently without approval, the result will inevitably be serious chaos. Often, a factory, mine, district, or township receives dozens or hundreds of survey forms from many agencies, most of which are duplicated or not very necessary for national construction. This results in a great waste of statistical forces. If we allow these duplicated and chaotic statistical forms to proliferate freely, it will inevitably make it impossible to complete the basic statistics uniformly arranged by the State Statistical Bureau. Therefore, in order to utilize statistical forces in a planned way and ensure the completion of the main statistical tasks, we must also establish a unified leadership system for statistical work. If governments at all levels need to issue periodic reports or arrange large-scale surveys, they must obtain the consent of the statistical agencies at the next higher level. If business departments need to issue professional statistical reports, they must also obtain the consent of the State Statistical Bureau at the same level. It is forbidden to issue statistical forms indiscriminately. Statistical agencies at all levels have the responsibility to fight against the phenomenon of indiscriminate issuance of forms and eliminate this phenomenon.

The second issue is the task of statistical work. As mentioned earlier, the main task of our statistical work at present is to provide the leading organs with the statistical data necessary for deciding policies and formulating plans, and to check the completion of plans through statistical data. Our national construction has its focus. Therefore, the statistical work serving national construction should also have its focus. We must first do a good job in the statistics of state-owned industry and basic construction, especially the statistics of heavy industry, and strive to be accurate and timely. Secondly, we must do a good job in the statistics of agricultural production, commodity circulation, transportation, labor wages, material distribution, and even culture, education, and health, because these are also included in our national construction plan. In order to decide policies, the leading organs need to understand not only the development of industrial and agricultural production, but also the changes in the proportion of public and private economies, and the development of mutual assistance and cooperation in the individual economy. Therefore, the survey and statistical work related to this must also be established. All of this is the statistical work necessary for our national construction. It is the basic task of our statistical workers, and we must use all our strength to ensure the solid completion of these basic tasks.

Different statistical items should have different requirements based on their importance. For example, in industrial production, the requirements for state-owned industry and private industry are different, the requirements for large-scale industry and small-scale industry are different, and the requirements for major products and minor products are different. Some should establish a telegraphic rapid report system, some should establish a periodic report system, and others should use relevant data from all parties concerned, or use methods such as typical surveys to collect materials and estimate. We should use our statistical forces in the departments that have the most decisive significance for national construction. Our "1953 National Statistical Work Outline" is formulated according to the above principles. After three days of discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that the requirements of this work outline are not high, and the reports listed in it are indispensable data for national construction. Everyone worried that this work outline might not be able to meet all the requirements of the leading organs. But on the other hand, everyone also unanimously believed that it is difficult for our current statistical institutions and statistical cadres to shoulder such a large statistical task. In some areas, it can be said that they are beyond their capabilities. Therefore, the serious problem existing in the current statistical work is that the objective requirements and subjective forces are extremely incompatible. This is the problem that must be solved in this meeting.

How to solve the above contradiction between needs and possibilities? We believe that in addition to strengthening statistical institutions and strengthening statistical work, we must also correctly use our statistical forces and clearly stipulate our basic statistical tasks. These basic statistical tasks should be stipulated according to the needs of national construction. Our statistical work outline is our basic statistical task stipulated according to the needs of national construction. Statistical agencies at all levels and statistical agencies of various business departments should concentrate their efforts to first complete these basic statistical tasks. Of course, in addition to completing the basic statistical tasks stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau, statistical agencies at all levels and statistical agencies of various business departments should also do a good job in the local and professional surveys and statistics that are suitable for the needs of local governments and the needs of business departments. However, these local and professional surveys and statistics should be based on the principle of not hindering the solid completion of the national basic statistical tasks. Therefore, statistical agencies at all levels and statistical agencies of various business departments must arrange their work in accordance with the "National Statistical Work Outline", and the reporting system stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau must be strictly observed. This is the work discipline that everyone must observe in order to complete the national statistical tasks.

Some comrades worry that after the statistical work is under the unified leadership of the Central Government, the statistical tasks of the Central Government and the statistical tasks of the local governments may conflict, and satisfying the needs of the Central Government may not satisfy the needs of the local governments. It should be pointed out that the tasks of the Central Government and the tasks of the local governments are basically the same, because everyone has a common and basic task, which is national construction. Our statistical work is to serve national construction, so it is not only urgently needed by the Central Government, but also urgently needed by the local party and government organs to supervise and guide the national construction in their respective regions. If our statistical data can meet the requirements of the Central Government, then it should be said that it can also meet the requirements of the local governments. Although each region has its own special circumstances, and therefore has some special requirements of its own, these special requirements will not be many, and if properly grasped, they can also be completed.

In the past, our basic statistical work has not been truly established, and our statistical data is too little. Therefore, it cannot meet the requirements of the local leading organs (and of course it cannot meet the requirements of the Central Government either). At the same time, because large-scale economic construction nationwide has not yet begun in the past, what some local leading organs urgently needed was not the statistical data needed for formulating plans, but the statistical data needed for deciding specific policies, and some professional statistical data. This situation will gradually change in the future. On the one hand, we have already arranged a relatively complete set of statistical reports, and are preparing to arrange some more reports that are necessary for deciding national policies (such as the survey of private industry and commerce), in order to meet the needs of the central and local leading organs as much as possible; on the other hand, because large-scale economic construction is about to begin, the attention of the local leading organs will gradually shift to construction, and they will need these basic statistical data related to economic construction even more. Therefore, they will be more concerned about the completion of national statistical tasks.

Future statistical work must establish scientific systems and regular work plans; avoid unscientific methods such as temporary rushes and random grabs everywhere. The heads of local leading organs and business departments should put forward their requirements for statistical agencies as soon as possible and include them in the work plan, and reduce temporary rushes as much as possible, so as not to hinder regular statistical work. At the same time, we must distinguish between national statistical tasks and professional surveys and statistics. Professional surveys should be the responsibility of the relevant business departments, so as not to hinder the solid completion of national basic statistical tasks. In order to complete the above work tasks, it is absolutely necessary to strengthen statistical agencies and supplement statistical cadres. We have already put forward a preliminary plan and submitted it to the leading organs for consideration and decision. We need to strengthen not only the statistical agencies of governments at all levels, but also the statistical agencies of various business departments, because this is still the most important source of our statistical data.

Strengthening statistical agencies requires not only increasing the number of cadres, but more importantly improving the quality of cadres. Statistical cadres must be politically loyal and reliable, and wholeheartedly serve the people, and at the same time, they must be competent in statistical work, or have the potential to be trained. Because statistical work is still a new job in our country, and everyone still lacks experience, we must make great efforts to train statistical cadres, improve the professional ability of cadres, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, promote our own existing work experience, and also open short-term training courses and seize business learning in daily work. These are all the determining keys to carrying out statistical work.

Our task is arduous. But the growth of our subjective forces still needs a period of time. Therefore, everyone should be mentally prepared to work under difficult conditions. Because large-scale economic construction in 1953 is about to begin, and many tasks must be strengthened. This is not only the case for the statistical departments. If everyone is working under difficult circumstances, then it is impossible for the statistical departments to be alone without difficulties. Only if everyone is not afraid of difficulties and strives to overcome difficulties can we accelerate the progress of our national construction work. I hope that all statistical comrades will strive to overcome difficulties and complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the state.

    配合大规模经济建设，建立科学的统计制度
    ——在全国统计工作会议上的总结报告
    国家统计局局长  薛暮桥
    全国统计工作会议快要闭幕了。在这次会议中我们讨论了如何配合大规模的经济建设建立科学的统计工作，讨论了一九五三年的统计工作纲要和工作计划，并提出了充实统计机构加强统计工作的具体方案，朱副主席在闭幕之前还给了我们以宝贵的指示，因而大家对如何建立统计工作，和今后统计工作的具体任务，有了比较明确的、相当一致的认识，这是一个很重要的收获。这个收获所以特别重要，是由于我国的统计工作目前还在初创阶段，许多统计干部还是初做统计工作。在这开始时期，对于方针任务的一致的认识有着特别重要的意义。它使我们能够步调一致，把这种新的、科学的统计工作迅速地在全国范围建立起来。
    全国大规模的经济建设就要开始。谁都知道，我们要进行大规模的经济建设，就必须有一个正确的、完全符合于社会经济发展情况的经济建设计划；而统计工作则是计划工作的基础。如果没有正确的统计数字，便不可能制订正确的经济建设计划，也不可能及时检查计划的完成情况。因此，加强统计工作，正是迎接大规模经济建设的必要条件之一。
    建立科学的统计工作，必须按照中国的具体情况，学习苏联的先进经验，在中央统一领导下建立一套系统的统计制度和统计方法。为什么我们的统计工作必须由中央来统一领导呢？这是由于我们的计划工作是全国统一的，因此作为计划工作基础的统计工作也必须全国统一。谁都知道，我们的经济建设必须有全国统一的计划，不能各地各搞一套计划。特别是大规模的经济建设，每一个大工厂都是按照全国的需要来进行生产的，每一项大建设不但必须照顾到全国的需要，而且必须照顾到三年五年以至十年后的需要，这就非由中央领导机关来统一掌握不可。既然建设计划要由中央统一规定，那末为制订建设计划，和检查计划完成情况所需要的统计资料，自然也必须是全国性的。如果各地各自制订调查统计计划，那就必然由于调查范围不同，表式指标不同，分类方法不同，计算方法不同，而使各地区的统计资料，不可能在全国范围综合和互相比较，因而它就不可能成为制订全国建设计划的根据。为着使我们的统计资料能在全国范围综合和互相比较，便必须由国家统计局来颁发全国统一的统计报表。这种报表的调查范围，表式指标，分类方法，计算方法，不但必须全国统一，而且必须与计划部门完全一致；否则就不能适合计划部门的需要，也不能检查计划的完成情况。因之，统计工作必须要由中央统一领导。
    统计工作统一领导的另一个重要意义，是有计划地利用现有统计力量，以保证国家统计任务的确实完成。如果各级政府及各业务部门可以不经批准各自颁发调查统计表格，其结果必然会造成严重的混乱现象。往往一个厂矿，一个区乡接到从许多机关发来的几十几百种调查表格，这些调查表格绝大部分是互相重复的，或对国家建设并不是十分需要的，这样就造成了统计力量的极大浪费。如果让这些重复混乱的统计表格自由泛滥，那就必然会使国家统计局统一布置的基本统计无法完成。所以为着有计划地利用统计力量，保证完成主要的统计任务，也必须建立统计工作的统一领导制度。各级政府如须颁发定期报表，或布置规模较大的调查，必须征得上级统计机构同意，各业务部门如须颁发专业统计报表，亦必须征得同级国家统计机构同意，禁止滥发统计表格，各级统计机构均有责任与滥发表格的现象进行斗争，并消除这种现象。
    其次一个问题，是统计工作的任务问题，如前所述我们统计工作在目前的主要任务，是向领导机关提供决定政策，制订计划所必需的统计资料，并通过统计资料来检查计划的完成情况。我们的国家建设是有重点的，因此为国家建设服务的统计工作也应该有重点。我们首先必须做好国营工业和基本建设的统计，特别是重工业的统计，要求做到正确和及时。其次要做好农业生产，商品流转，交通运输，劳动工资，物资分配，以至文教卫生等项统计，因为这也是列入我们国家的建设计划的。领导机关为着决定政策，他们不但需要了解工农业的生产发展情况，而且需要了解公私经济比重的变化情况，和在个体经济中互助合作的发展等。因而与此有关系的调查统计工作，也必须建立起来。这一切，都是我们国家建设所必需的统计工作，是我们统计工作者的基本任务，我们必须用一切力量来保证这些基本任务的确实完成。
    各种统计应按重要程度不同，而订出不同的要求。如工业生产中，国营工业与私营工业要求不同，大型工业与小型工业要求不同，主要产品与次要产品要求不同。有的应该建立电报快报，有的应该建立定期报表制度，有的则应利用有关各方面的资料，或用典型调查等类方法收集材料，估计推算。应该把我们的统计力量使用在对国家建设最有决定意义的部门。我们的“一九五三年全国统计工作纲要”便是按照上述原则来制订的，经过三天讨论，大家一致承认这个工作纲要要求不高，其中所列报表都是国家建设所不可缺少的资料，大家耽心这个工作纲要还可能满足不了领导机关的全部要求。但另一方面，大家又一致认为以我们现在有的统计机构和统计干部来负担这样大的统计任务，是有困难的，有些地区可以说是力不胜任的。因此目前统计工作所存在的严重问题是客观的要求与主观的力量极不相称，这是此次会议必须解决的问题。
    怎样来解决上述需要与可能间的矛盾呢？我们认为，除充实统计机构和加强统计工作外，还必须正确地来使用我们的统计力量，明确规定我们的基本统计任务，这种基本统计任务是应该按国家建设的需要来规定的。我们的统计工作纲要，便是我们按国家建设的需要来规定的基本统计任务。各级统计机构及各业务部门的统计机构应该集中力量，首先来完成这些基本统计任务。当然，各级统计机构和各业务部门的统计机构除完成国家统计局所规定的基本统计任务外，还应该做好适合于地方政府需要及业务部门需要的地方性和专业性的调查统计。但这种地方性的，专业性的调查统计，应以不妨碍国家基本统计任务的确实完成为原则。所以各级统计机构及各业务部门的统计机构必须按照“全国统计工作纲要”来安排自己的工作，国家统计局所规定的报表制度必须确实遵守。为着完成国家统计任务，这是大家必须遵守的工作纪律。
    有些同志耽心在统计工作由中央统一领导后，中央的统计任务与地方的统计任务可能发生矛盾，满足了中央的需要便满足不了地方的需要。应该指出，中央的任务与地方的任务基本上是一致的，因为大家有一个共同的、基本的任务，这就是国家建设。我们的统计工作是为国家建设服务的，因此不但为中央所迫切需要，而且也是地方党政机关为监督指导本地区的国家建设所迫切需要，如果我们这些统计资料能够满足中央的要求，那末应该说也能够满足地方的要求。虽然各地区有各地区的特殊情况，因而也有一些各地区的特殊要求，但这种特殊要求不会很多，如果适当掌握是同样可以完成的。
    过去我们的基本统计工作尚未真正建立起来，我们的统计资料太少，因此就满足不了地方领导机关的要求（当然同样亦满足不了中央的要求）。同时由于过去全国大规模的经济建设尚未开始，有些地方领导机关所迫切需要的还不是制订计划所需要的统计资料，而是决定具体政策所需要的统计资料，和某些专业性的统计资料。今后这种情况将会逐渐变化，一方面我们已经布置了一套比较完整的统计报表，并准备再布置一些为决定国家政策所必需的报表（如私营工商业的调查等），以尽可能满足中央和地方领导机关的需要；另一方面由于大规模经济建设即将开始，地方领导机关的注意力将逐渐转移到建设方面来，他们将更需要这些有关经济建设的基本统计资料，因而会更关心于国家统计任务的完成。
    今后的统计工作必须建立科学的制度和经常的工作计划；避免临时突击，到处乱抓这种不科学的方法。地方领导机关和业务部门的首长应该把他们对统计机构的要求及早提出，列入工作计划，尽可能地减少临时性的突击，以免妨碍经常的统计工作。同时要把国家统计任务与专业性的调查统计区别开来，专业调查应由有关业务部门负责，以免妨碍国家基本统计任务的确实完成。为着完成上述工作任务，充实统计机构，补充统计干部是完全必要的，我们已经提出了一个初步的方案，报请领导机关考虑决定。我们不但需要加强各级地方政府的统计机构，尤其需要加强各业务部门的统计机构，因为目前这还是我们统计资料的最主要的来源。
    充实统计机构不仅要增加干部的数量，更重要的是要提高干部的质量。统计干部必须在政治上是忠实可靠，全心全意为人民服务的，同时又必须是胜任统计工作，或有培养前途的。由于统计工作在我国还是一件新的工作，大家还缺乏经验，因此必须用大力来培养统计干部，提高干部的业务能力，必须学习苏联先进经验，并推广自己已有的工作经验，还要开短期训练班和抓紧日常工作中的业务学习。这都是开展统计工作的决定的关键。
    我们的任务是繁重的。但我们主观力量的生长还需要有一段时间。因此大家在思想上应准备在困难的条件下来进行工作。因为一九五三年大规模的经济建设即要开始，许多工作均须加强。不仅仅是统计部门。如果大家都在困难情况之下工作，那末统计部门决不可能单独没有困难，只有大家不怕困难，努力克服困难，才能使我们的国家建设工作加速前进。希望全体统计工作同志努力克服困难，来完成国家交给我们的光荣任务。
