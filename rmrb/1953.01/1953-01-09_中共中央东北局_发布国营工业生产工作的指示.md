    The CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau
    Issues Instructions on State-Owned Industrial Production Work
    [This Newspaper] The CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau issued instructions on January 4 regarding the work of state-owned industrial production in the first quarter of 1953, requiring state-owned industrial departments in Northeast China to fully explore potential strengths and compile advanced production, technology, and financial plans, and ensure that they are overfulfilled, in order to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction and the growing material and cultural life of the people. The instructions require all state-owned industries and local state-owned industries in the region to do the following in the first quarter of 1953:
    I. Mobilize all employees to seriously discuss the production targets set by the state for 1953, and formulate action plans to complete and overfulfill the state production plan. It is necessary to deeply publicize among all employees the great significance of starting to implement the first five-year plan for national construction, explain the national construction policy, clarify the responsibilities of the working class, and further enhance the sense of responsibility and labor enthusiasm of each employee as masters of the country, in order to greet the large-scale economic construction of the country with practical actions to overfulfill the state production plan. In discussing the production plan stipulated by the state, it is necessary to prevent and oppose all kinds of conservative ideas and practices, and to prevent and oppose formalism and one-sidedness in the discussion of the production plan. It is necessary to discuss and formulate plans to improve safety and welfare work, and actively and systematically solve the key problems that are prone to causing casualties and seriously damaging the health of employees. According to the tasks given by the state and the development plan of the enterprise, specific plans should be formulated to train skilled workers, technicians, management personnel, and political workers, in order to meet the needs of basic construction and newly built enterprises, and to ensure the continued development and improvement of the enterprise. After discussing the plan, it is necessary to mobilize all employees to formulate group patriotic pacts and contact contracts between relevant departments, and to prepare for the widespread establishment of collective contracts, and to launch a production competition campaign.
    II. According to the current situation of state-owned industrial production, improve production management to make more rational use of the existing industrial base and existing equipment. To this end, it is necessary to improve the labor organization of workshops and pits, implement "fixing machines, fixing people, fixing jobs" for labor specialization; promote advanced experience, improve and adjust the weak links of equipment, strengthen equipment maintenance and upkeep, and improve equipment utilization; formulate correct operation plans, promote the production instruction chart method, and organize rhythmic and balanced production. In industrial production management, great importance must be attached to the trial production of new products. The plan for trial production of new products should be included in the national production plan and used as one of the main contents for checking the implementation of the national production plan.
    III. The guiding principle of local state-owned industries should be to concentrate efforts on consolidation and improvement, give full play to the effectiveness of existing equipment, tap potential capabilities, and overcome backward phenomena in business management and political work. The provincial and municipal party committees should focus on strengthening leadership cadres and strengthening leadership for their local state-owned industries in a focused and step-by-step manner, mobilize the masses, and first concentrate their efforts on establishing a planning management and production responsibility system, establishing a democratic management system, and overcoming the chaotic phenomenon in management. Then, through quota management, implement the economic accounting system. Low product quality and high costs are a serious problem that exists universally in local state-owned industries and should be addressed with great attention. All local state-owned enterprises with a relatively solid foundation should establish technical management and cost management systems carefully and step by step in accordance with the experience of state-owned industries, in order to improve product quality and reduce production costs. In order to implement the above principles, the most important thing is to implement a comprehensive policy of thought among the leading cadres of local state-owned industries, clarify the nature, tasks, and principles of local state-owned industries, overcome the idea of ​​"greed for big and more" and the pursuit of quantitative development and neglect of consolidation and improvement, and overcome the purely profit-oriented views remaining in the production enterprises of organs. The provincial and municipal party committees should organize a group of urban organ party branch forces, adopt a contract system, and use spare time to help local state-owned industries strengthen the education of employees on communism and the Communist Party, and establish party and Communist Youth League branches.
    IV. Use the method of strengthening ideological and political leadership to ensure and supervise the thorough completion of the above-mentioned central tasks. It is necessary to deeply publicize the three great tasks of the people of the whole country in 1953 among all cadres and employees in the industrial sector in accordance with the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, so that every household knows and everyone understands. In the publicity, it is necessary to repeatedly explain that funds must be used with emphasis in the national construction cause, and the funds should be mainly used in the construction of heavy industry and national defense construction, which are most decisive for the fate of the country, and oppose the idea of ​​reviving everything; it is necessary to continue to practice thrift and careful calculation, and use every penny that can be saved for construction. It is required to further tap potential strength in industrial production enterprises, fully utilize all possible conditions, oppose all kinds of conservative ideas and local views, and do our best to continuously support basic construction with cadres, technicians, and skilled workers.
    In order to complete the arduous tasks of the first quarter of 1953, the instructions pointed out: It is necessary to further improve the leadership level of political work, combine the above-mentioned central tasks, and conscientiously implement the Northeast Bureau's "Resolution on the Party's Leadership of State-Owned Enterprises", and continue to promote the work experience of the 53 Factory. The provincial and municipal party committees must seriously and systematically check the implementation of the Northeast Bureau's "Resolution on the Party's Leadership of State-Owned Enterprises" and the promotion of the work experience of the 53 Factory in the factory and mining enterprises under their jurisdiction in the first quarter, commend those units that have done well in this regard, summarize and promote their experience, criticize those units that have not done well in this regard, and urge them to improve quickly. In particular, for those backward but more important factories and mines, specific improvement plans should be formulated, certain requirements should be put forward, and in-depth inspections should be carried out to improve the ideological level of cadres, improve work style, and help them solve specific problems, so that the work of these factories and mines can be effectively improved. In the political work of the first quarter, whether in factories or mines, special attention must be paid to strengthening the work among technicians and staff, and earnestly make achievements and gain experience. This is the premise for changing the relatively common state of "advanced planning, active workers, and backward management" that currently exists in factories and mines. Therefore, the cadres of party and mass work in factories and mining enterprises must not only be good at ensuring and supervising workshop production work, but also further study and master business management skills.

    中共中央东北局
    发布国营工业生产工作的指示
    【本报讯】中共中央东北局一月四日发出关于一九五三年第一季度国营工业生产工作的指示，要求东北各国营工业部门充分发掘潜在力量，编制出先进的生产、技术、财务计划，并保证超额完成，以满足全国大规模经济建设和日益增长的人民物质文化生活的需要。指示要求全区国营工业与地方国营工业在一九五三年第一季度，必须作好下列几项工作：
    一、发动全体职工认真地讨论一九五三年国家规定的生产指标，制订出完成与超额完成国家生产计划的行动计划。要在全体职工中深入宣传开始执行国家建设第一个五年计划的伟大意义，解释国家建设的方针，明确工人阶级的职责，进一步提高每个职工国家主人翁的觉悟和劳动热情，以超额完成国家生产计划的实际行动迎接国家大规模经济建设。在讨论国家规定的生产计划中，要防止与反对各式各样的保守思想与做法，要防止与反对讨论生产计划中的形式主义和片面性。要讨论和制订改善安全与福利工作的计划，积极地有步骤地解决那些容易引起伤亡事故和严重损害职工健康的关键问题。要根据国家所给的任务和企业发展计划，订出培养技术工人、技术人员、管理人员和政治工作人员的具体计划，以满足基本建设和新建企业的需要，并保证本企业的继续发展与提高。在讨论计划之后，要发动全体职工制订小组爱国公约和各有关部门间的联系合同，并有准备地普遍订立集体合同，展开生产竞赛运动。
    二、根据目前国营工业生产的情况，改善生产管理工作，以更合理地利用现有的工业基础和现有的设备。为此，必须改善车间及坑口的劳动组织，实行“定机、定人、定活”的劳动专业化；推广先进经验，改进与调整设备的薄弱环节，加强设备的检修与保养工作，提高设备利用率；制订正确的作业计划，推行生产指示图表方法，组织有节奏的均衡生产。在工业生产管理上，对新产品试制工作必须十分重视。要把试制新产品的计划列入国家生产计划，并做为检查国家生产计划执行情况的主要内容之一。
    三、地方国营工业的方针应是集中力量进行巩固与提高工作，充分发挥现有设备效能，发掘潜在能力，克服在经营管理和政治工作上的落后现象。各省、市委对所属地方国营工业，应当有重点有步骤地充实领导骨干，加强领导，发动群众，首先集中力量建立计划管理和生产责任制，建立民主管理制度，克服管理上的混乱现象。然后经过定额管理，贯彻经济核算制。产品质量低、成本高，是地方国营工业中普遍存在的一个严重问题，应当大力注意解决。地方国营工业中一切较有基础的企业，均应根据国营工业的经验，认真地有步骤地建立技术管理与成本管理制度，借以提高产品质量和降低生产成本。为了贯彻上述方针，最重要的是要在地方国营工业领导干部中，贯彻全面政策思想，明确地方国营工业的性质、任务和方针，克服“贪大贪多”和追求量的发展忽视巩固提高的思想，克服机关生产企业残留的单纯营利观点。省、市委应组织一批城市机关党支部的力量，采取包干的办法，利用业余活动时间，帮助地方国营工业加强对职工关于共产主义和共产党的教育，并建立党、团支部。
    四、用加强思想政治领导的方法，保证监督上述各项中心工作的彻底完成。必须根据人民日报元旦社论在工业部门的全体干部与全体职工中，深入宣传一九五三年全国人民三项伟大任务，做到家喻户晓，人人明白。在宣传中要反复说明：在国家建设事业上必须有重点地使用资金，把资金主要用在对国家命运最有决定意义的重工业建设和国防建设上面，反对百废俱兴；要继续厉行节约，精打细算，把能节省的每一文钱都用到建设上来。要求在工业生产企业中，进一步挖掘潜在力量，把一切可能利用的条件都充分利用起来，反对各种保守思想与局部观点，尽最大努力，以干部、技术人员和技术工人源源不断地支援基本建设。
    为了完成一九五三年第一季度的繁重任务，指示指出：必须进一步提高政治工作的领导水平，结合上述各项中心工作，切实贯彻东北局“关于党对国营企业领导的决议”，继续推广五三工厂的工作经验。各省、市委在第一季度均须认真地有计划地检查所属厂矿企业贯彻东北局“关于党对国营企业领导的决议”和推广五三工厂工作经验的情况，表扬那些在这方面做得好的单位，总结和推广其经验，批评那些在这方面做得不好的单位，督促其迅速改进。特别是对于那些工作落后而又比较重要的厂矿，应订出具体的改进计划，提出一定的要求，并进行深入检查，提高干部的思想水平，改善工作作风，帮助其解决具体问题，使这些厂矿的工作切实得到改进。在第一季度的政治工作中，无论工厂或矿山，均须特别注意加强技术人员和职员当中的工作，切实做出成绩，取得经验，这是改变目前厂矿中比较普遍存在的“计划先进，工人积极，管理落后”状态的前提。因此，厂矿企业党与群众工作干部，不仅要善于保证监督车间生产工作，而且要进一步学习与掌握经营管理方面的业务。
