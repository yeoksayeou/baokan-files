    French and Norwegian Peace Organizations Actively Prepare
    To Convey Resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress to the People Nationwide
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] According to TASS: Peace fighters in France and Norway are actively preparing to promote the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress to the people nationwide.
    The French National Peace Council held a meeting in Paris on the 10th and 11th to discuss the implementation of various resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress. French National Peace Council Chairman Fajon, Progressive Republican Union member De Chambellan, and other council members spoke at the meeting, emphasizing the importance of the World People's Peace Congress and the necessity of widely publicizing the Congress resolutions. The National Peace Council adopted a letter to the French people, stating: Restoring France's national independence is a guarantee of its security. Only a peace treaty with a unified, democratic Germany can ensure that Germany itself and its neighbors are not harmed by the revival of German imperialism, and that West Germany does not become a hotbed of war. The letter to the people, after pointing out the importance of an immediate ceasefire in Korea and the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, stated: France, as one of the five major powers, can make an effective contribution to the conclusion of a peace pact. The threat of a third world war to France's survival is greater than to any other country, so France has a direct stake in the conclusion of a peace pact. The letter to the people finally called on all French people to strengthen their movement demanding an end to the wars in Vietnam and Korea, a negotiated solution to the German question, and the signing of a five-power peace pact.
    Norwegian progressive groups are organizing a campaign to convey the Vienna Congress resolutions to the Norwegian people. Norwegian delegates to the Vienna Congress, including Pastor Fobeck, have already reported at mass meetings in Oslo. Participants in the congress passed a resolution amidst warm applause, expressing their support for the various resolutions of the Vienna Congress, and calling for the expansion of the movement to defend peace in Norway. In other Norwegian cities such as Bergen, Stavanger, and Drammen, mass meetings will be held separately to convey the Vienna Congress resolutions.

    法国、挪威和平组织积极进行筹备
    向全国人民传达世界人民和平大会决议
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社讯：法国和挪威的和平战士们都正在积极筹备向全国人民宣传世界人民和平大会决议的运动。
    法国全国和平理事会于十日和十一日在巴黎举行会议，讨论执行世界人民和平大会各项决议问题。法国全国和平理事会主席法奇，进步共和联盟盟员德香布兰和理事会其他理事都在会上发言，他们着重指出了世界人民和平大会的重要性及广泛地宣传大会决议案的必要。全国和平理事会通过了告法国人民书，它说：恢复法兰西的民族独立是它的安全的保证。只有和统一的民主德国签订和约才能保证德国自己和它的邻国不受德国帝国主义复活的危害，才能保证西德不成为战争的温床。告人民书在指出了立即在朝鲜停火和缔结五大国和平公约的重要意义后说：五大国之一的法国能够对缔结和平公约作出有效的贡献。第三次世界大战对法国的生存的威胁比对任何国家都大，所以法国对于缔结和平公约是有切身的利害关系的。告人民书最后要求所有法国人加强他们要求停止越南和朝鲜战争、经由谈判方式以解决德国问题、和签订五大国和平公约的运动。
    挪威进步团体正在组织向挪威人民传达维也纳大会决议的运动，出席维也纳大会的挪威代表、牧师福贝克等人已在奥斯陆的群众大会上作报告，参加大会的人在热烈的掌声中通过决议，表示拥护维也纳大会各项决议，并号召在挪威扩大保卫和平的运动。在挪威的其他城市如卑尔根、斯达完格、德拉门等，都将分别召开传达维也纳大会决议的群众大会。
