The work of preventing and controlling overwintering rice borers, one of the central tasks of winter production, has been launched successively in rice-producing provinces in the three major administrative regions of East China, Central South, and Southwest. Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi and other areas severely affected by rice borers have launched large-scale work to dig up and destroy rice roots. According to incomplete statistics, 3.84 million mu of rice fields in Zhejiang Province have had their rice roots dug up, and 20% of the province's counties have nearly completed the work of digging up and destroying rice roots. In southern Jiangsu, approximately 7 million mu of rice fields have had their rice roots dug up, accounting for more than 70% of all rice fields. As of early December 1952, Fujian Province had dug up and destroyed rice roots in more than 3.4 million mu of rice fields, accounting for 24% of the province's mid-season and late-season rice area. Some districts and townships in Longyan, Jian'ou and other counties in the province have completely completed this work. In Hunan Province, only 33 counties including Xiangtan, Shaoyang prefectures, Xiangnan Administrative Region, and Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region have more than 2 million farmers participating in the digging up and destruction of rice roots. A total of more than 3.6 million mu of rice fields have been dug up and the rice roots destroyed, 2.57 million mu of paddy fields have been plowed and flooded, and 1.51 million strips of weeds on field ridges have been removed.

The current rice borer control movement is still not in-depth. In areas severely affected by the rice stem borer, such as Hunan, some cadres simply emphasize that the rice stem borer is an omnivorous pest that overwinters in wild rice stems, reeds and straw, making it difficult to completely eliminate, and therefore relax their efforts in digging up and destroying rice roots in thought and action. However, the practical experience of rice borer control in Liling County, Hunan Province in recent years has proven that the vast majority of rice stem borers overwinter in rice roots, and digging up and destroying rice roots has a very good effect on eliminating rice stem borers. Secondly, some areas have also carried out this work, but it has not been done thoroughly. The rice roots are not dug up cleanly, or they are dug up but not destroyed, and the rice borers hidden in the rice roots are still not eliminated. In Gutian County, Fujian, the rice roots of more than 350,000 mu of rice fields were dug up, but only one-tenth of the rice roots were burned or used for fertilizer. In Fengqiao District, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang, although the work of digging up and destroying rice roots was arranged, most of the roots were cut off at the mud level, and the rice roots that could harbor rice borers remained in the mud. Some areas that had achieved good results in rice borer control in the past showed complacency. In the current pest control movement in Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, no instructions were issued nor specific arrangements made, blindly assuming that the farmers would carry out the work themselves without leadership.

The winter rice borer control work began in early winter, and more than half of the time has passed, but many areas have not done well. In order to step up this work, the leading organs in each rice-producing area should immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of this work. At present, Zhejiang Province has dispatched 28 cadres and Hunan Province has dispatched 34 cadres to the countryside for inspection. In order to launch a "replenishment" movement, many areas in Hunan Province are conducting re-inspections in areas where rice roots have already been dug up and destroyed. Some townships in the province have even organized inspection teams on a township basis. These are all very necessary.

### 部分产稻区冬季治螟工作作得不好  应即抽派干部深入检查推动治螟运动

    部分产稻区冬季治螟工作作得不好
    应即抽派干部深入检查推动治螟运动
    冬季生产中心工作之一的防治越冬螟虫的工作已先后在华东、中南、西南三大行政区的各产稻省份展开。浙江、江苏、福建、江西等螟虫严重为害的地区，大规模地开展了掘毁稻根工作。据不完全的统计，浙江省已掘毁了稻根的稻田有三百八十四万亩，全省有百分之二十的县的挖毁稻根工作已接近完成。江苏南部已掘毁稻根的稻田约七百万亩，占全部稻田的百分之七十以上。福建省到一九五二年十二月上旬，已挖毁稻根的稻田有三百四十多万亩，占全省中稻晚稻面积的百分之二十四。该省龙岩、建瓯等县部分区乡已全部完成这一工作。湖南省仅湘潭、邵阳专区和湘南行政区、湘西苗族自治区等三十三个县参加掘毁稻根的农民有二百多万人，经过挖毁稻根的稻田共有三百六十多万亩，已犁浸水田二百五十七万亩，铲除了一百五十一万条田塍上的杂草。
    目前治螟运动开展得仍不深入。在二化螟为害严重地区，例如湖南，有些干部单纯强调二化螟是杂食性的害虫，在茭白、芦苇和稻草中过冬，不易彻底消灭，因此在思想上和行动上放松了掘毁稻根工作。但湖南省醴陵县几年来治螟的实际经验证明，二化螟绝大部分是在稻根中过冬，掘毁稻根对于消除二化螟有很好的效果。其次，有些地区也进行了这一工作，但做得很不彻底，稻根挖掘不净，或掘了没有毁掉，潜藏在稻根中的螟虫依然没有消灭。福建古田县挖了三十五万多亩稻田的稻根，其中把稻根烧掉的或是拿去沤肥的仅占十分之一。浙江嘉兴县凤桥区，虽然布置了掘毁稻根工作，但大多数都是齐泥割下，可以潜藏螟虫的稻根依然留在泥里。某些过去治螟工作较有成绩的地区表现了自满情绪。江西省南昌专区在这次治虫运动中，既没有下指示，也没有具体布置，盲目地认为不去领导农民自己也会进行。
    冬季治螟工作自冬初开始后，到目前为止，已经过了一大半时间，但不少地区作得很不好。为了加紧进行这一工作，各产稻区领导机关应即对于这一工作，进行一次深入的检查。目前浙江省已抽调干部二十八人，湖南省已抽调三十四人下乡检查，湖南省的许多地区为了开展“补火”运动，正在已进行过掘毁稻根的地区进行复查。这个省有的乡还以乡为单位组织了检查队。这都是十分必要的。
