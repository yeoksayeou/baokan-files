    The Resist America, Aid Korea Branch of Xuanwu District, Beijing, wrote: We convened a representative meeting of 167 resident propagandists in December of last year. At the meeting, we summarized the resident propaganda work of the district for the past year and nine months, introduced the experience of the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, and, according to the spirit of the instructions of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, stipulated the tasks of resident propaganda work for the future as follows: (1) Strengthen the leadership and education of resident propagandists to enable them to play a greater role; (2) Implement the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner; (3) Continue to implement patriotic covenants, and plan to launch a general inspection and revision of patriotic covenants among citizens throughout the district in January of this year; (4) Consolidate and develop reading groups. In addition, the conference also arranged for resident propagandists throughout the district to study the specific methods of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea's "Instructions on Continuing to Strengthen the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea."
    Luo Wen and Ai Wan from the Communist Party of China, Shifang County Committee, Sichuan Province, wrote: The group leaders of 21 production mutual aid teams, including Bai Tingxiang of Baihe Village, Yiqiao Township, collectively studied the instructions of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea on December 26 of last year. Based on the spirit of the instructions, they reviewed the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, patriotic production, and supporting the army and their families in the past stage, and formulated the following plans for the future: (1) Continue to strengthen propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea. It was decided to select and read aloud a report or communication on the situation of the Korean War in each evening reading group study, and the propagandist will explain it to everyone at the mass meeting. (2) Continue to carry out the patriotic bumper harvest movement to support the Volunteer Army. Complete the second hoeing of all wheat fields within ten days, and ensure the completion of the plan to increase the average yield by 75 jin per mu. Before the Lunar New Year, dredge all small ditches and embankments in the village, and shovel up the weeds on the edges of fields, roads, and ditches, striving for each laborer to accumulate 100 jin of fertilizer. In addition, do a good job in winter pest control, protecting cattle, and other work to prepare for the great production of 1953. (3) In terms of preferential treatment, ensure the completion of substitute farming and promptly help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers overcome difficulties in life; mobilize all villagers to prepare appropriate gifts during the Spring Festival to offer condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; guarantee that two letters are written to the Volunteer Army every month to report on production.
    Comrades Ren Zong and others from the Communist Party of China, Qixian County Committee, Shanxi, wrote: On December 28 of last year, we convened an expanded meeting of county and district-level cadres attended by more than 160 people. We generally reviewed and criticized the tendency of cadres to neglect current affairs propaganda and education over the past year, and decided to launch a propaganda movement week (from December 30 of last year to January 7 of this year) to implement the instructions of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea throughout the county, laying an ideological foundation for the development of current affairs propaganda and education in the future.
