    The North China Branch of the Coal Construction Company Should Not Reward Units That Falsely Report Achievements

    Editor: The leading cadres of the North China Branch of the China National Coal Industry Construction Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as the North China Branch) have a serious bureaucratic work style, which led to the erroneous rewarding of the Beijing Coal Industry Construction Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as the Beijing Company) in the industrial product sales competition. After the incident occurred, the leading cadres of the company did not examine or correct the situation, but instead attempted to conceal the truth.

    The Beijing Company performed poorly in the industrial product sales competition. In mid-August of last year, coal sales only reached a little over 43 percent of the monthly plan, making it the most backward unit in the entire North China coal construction company system. When the North China Branch sent Zhang Jian, the former deputy director of the Storage and Transportation Office, and others to the Beijing Company to assist in the competition, the Beijing Company, in order to show its achievements, reported to the higher authorities that the coal quantities under contract with various users but not yet sold were all counted as already sold. This exaggerated their achievements, claiming that they had "exceeded the plan by a little over 15 percent" when they had not completed the sales task.

    The statistics section of the North China Branch questioned this figure and called the statistics section of the Beijing Company. The response was that the figure had indeed been sold, so they believed it to be true. At the North China Branch's award evaluation meeting, many people questioned the achievements of the Beijing Company and asked Zhang Jian and Ma Xizhao, who had assisted in the competition in Beijing, to report. Zhang Jian said that the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce and himself had initially doubted the figure, but after repeated inquiries, the results showed there were no problems. Geng Chen, the manager of the North China Branch, saw the reported achievements of the Beijing Company and heard the words of Zhang Jian, Ma Xizhao, and others, so he decided to award the Beijing Company the "Winner's Red Flag." Because the questions raised by everyone were not resolved, they expressed dissatisfaction with the North China Branch's measures. The meeting finally decided to send another working group to the Beijing Company for investigation.

    On September 17th of last year, Wang Mingfa of the statistics section of the North China Branch went to the Beijing Company to investigate. The results of the investigation showed that the Beijing Company had indeed sold most of these quantities. However, a portion of the quantities were under futures contracts and agreements with customers and had not been paid for or picked up (quantities not paid for or picked up cannot be counted as sales). As of September 14th, the figures for such quantities were 65,000 tons of coal and 4,000 cubic meters of timber.

    After Wang Mingfa returned to the North China Branch, he immediately drafted a notice requiring all subordinate units to correctly calculate sales figures, pointing out the fact that the Beijing Company had falsely reported achievements. He also prepared to copy the notice to the North China Administrative Committee's Bureau of Trade and the China National Coal Industry Construction Materials General Company. However, when the draft notice was sent to Hao Ziyi, the deputy manager of the North China Branch, for review, Hao Ziyi deleted the section about the Beijing Company's false reporting of achievements in order to cover up the error. The comrades in the statistics section did not adhere to principles, so the matter was dropped.

    More seriously, the North China Branch did not pay attention even after the fact that the Beijing Company had falsely reported achievements was discovered, and consequently, it mistakenly awarded the Beijing Company the Winner's Red Flag again in September. The above shows that the bureaucratic style of the leading comrades of the North China Branch and the error of the Beijing Company in falsely reporting achievements are serious. The leading cadres of both companies should conduct self-criticisms. At the same time, the China National Coal Industry Construction Materials General Company should conduct a thorough investigation of this matter and handle it seriously.  Niè Tiějūn

    Editor's Note: Based on the above facts, the Beijing Company of the China National Coal Industry Construction Materials Company falsely reported achievements and obtained the red flag by deception in the industrial product sales competition. This behavior is extremely egregious.

    The North China Branch of the China National Coal Industry Construction Materials Company erroneously awarded the Beijing Coal Construction Company the red flag twice. After discovering the problem, the responsible cadres of the company did not seriously investigate or handle it, and concealed the facts, which is even more wrong. The China National Coal Industry Construction Materials General Company should conduct a thorough and comprehensive inspection of the competition activities of the North China Branch, the Beijing Company, and other units in order to summarize experiences and lessons, and earnestly improve its work. The results of the inspection and handling should be published in the newspaper.

### 煤建公司华北区公司不该奖励虚报成绩的单位

    煤建公司华北区公司不该奖励虚报成绩的单位
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区公司（下简称华北区公司）领导干部官僚主义作风严重，以致在工业品推销竞赛运动中，错误地奖励了虚报成绩的北京市煤业建筑器材公司（下简称北京市公司）。事情发生后，该公司领导干部不检查、纠正，反企图将事实真相遮掩起来。
    北京市公司在工业品推销竞赛运动中完成任务的情况很差。去年八月中旬，煤炭销售只完成该月计划百分之四十三强，为华北全区煤建公司系统最落后的单位。等到华北区公司派出前储运室副主任张鉴等到北京市公司协助开展竞赛时，北京市公司为了要表现自己有成绩，就把和各用户签订合同而尚未销出的煤炭数字都算作已销售的报告上级。这样就夸大了自己的成绩，把没有完成销售任务说为
    “超过计划百分之十五强”了。
    华北区公司统计科见到这个数字后发生疑问，曾打电话问北京市公司统计股，据答复这个数字实已销出，也就信以为真。在华北区公司举行评奖会议时，就有很多人对北京市公司所获得的成绩发生疑问，并请到北京市公司协助开展竞赛的张鉴、马锡照等报告。张鉴说北京市工商局及他自己起初对这个数字也曾发生怀疑，经过再三了解，结果还是没问题。华北区公司经理耿忱看到了北京市公司的表报成绩和听到了张鉴、马锡照等的话，就决定奖予北京市公司“优胜红旗”。因为大家所提疑问并未得到解决，因而对华北区公司的措施表示不满。会议最后决定再派出一个工作组到北京市公司进行了解。
    去年九月十七日，华北区公司统计科王铭法同志到北京市公司调查，调查结果：北京市公司对这些数字多数确已销出。但有一部分是与顾主订立期货合同、协议而尚未付款、提货的（未付款、提货的不能算作销售）。截至九月十四日止，像这样的数字有煤炭六万五千吨，木材四千立方公尺。
    王铭法同志回华北区公司后，立即起草一个通知，要求所属各单位正确统计销售数字，并指出北京市公司虚报成绩这一事实，同时准备抄呈华北行政委员会贸易局和中国煤建总公司。但当通知草稿送到区公司副经理郝子忆处审阅时，郝子忆为了遮盖错误，竟将北京市公司虚报成绩这一段删去，而统计科的同志也没有坚持原则，因此这事就这样不了了之。
    更严重的是，北京市公司虚报成绩的事实被发觉后，华北区公司还没有重视，因而九月份又同样错误地奖给北京市公司优胜红旗。以上说明，华北区公司领导同志的官僚主义和北京市公司虚报成绩的错误是严重的，该两公司的领导干部应作检讨。同时，中国煤建总公司对这事也应作深入检查，并认真处理。  聂铁钧
    编者按：根据上述事实，中国煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司在工业品推销竞赛运动中，虚报成绩，骗取红旗，这种行为是极端恶劣的。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区公司两次错误地奖给北京市煤建公司红旗，发现问题之后该公司负责干部也不认真追查、处理，并隐瞒事实，更是错误的。中国煤建总公司应对华北区公司以及北京市公司等单位的竞赛运动进行深入的全面的检查，以总结经验教训，切实改进工作。检查和处理的结果应在报上公布。
