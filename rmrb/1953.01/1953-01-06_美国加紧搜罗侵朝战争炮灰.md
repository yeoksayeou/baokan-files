Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The American aggressors, while plotting to expand their aggression throughout Asia, are intensifying their efforts to scour for cannon fodder needed to continue and expand the Korean War. U.S. Secretary of the Army Frank Pace announced on January 1 that the U.S. Army intends to rapidly equip the Syngman Rhee puppet army and train officers of the Rhee puppet army in order to utilize them more quickly and extensively for war.
    However, the American aggressors themselves know that the Rhee puppet army cannot be a substitute for the American army. The American magazine "Life" admitted on December 1 that if the Rhee puppet army were to fight alone, the result would inevitably be the collapse of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. A report submitted by the U.S. House of Representatives Military Subcommittee on December 30 also opposed withdrawing American troops from Korea. In addition to demanding the training of more Rhee Syngman puppet troops, it also demanded that the Kuomintang bandit troops be transferred to Korea to fight, and that "Asians should be used more to carry out their own military tasks."
    In order to realize this conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians," the American aggressors have already asked the Rhee bandit Syngman Rhee to go to Japan for a so-called "visit." According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 1st, quoting "foreign sources," the purpose of Rhee Syngman's "visit" is to "negotiate with the Yoshida reactionary government on the issue of Japanese troops participating in the Korean War," and to try to force Koreans in Japan to join the Rhee puppet army.
    The American aggressors are also preparing to put pressure on their vassal states to get them to participate more actively in America's military adventures. Associated Press reporter John Hightower reported on December 28 that Eisenhower, in order to realize his "more aggressive strategy" of expanding aggression in Asia, will demand that the vassal states "exert greater strength and take greater risks." Republican Senator Wiley, who is about to become chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, openly declared in the December 29 issue of "U.S. News & World Report" that the U.S. government should demand that the so-called "allies" contribute more manpower and material resources to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. He demanded that these "allies" show greater concern and assistance for America's aggressive measures; he said, "This is absolutely necessary."

### 美国加紧搜罗侵朝战争炮灰

    美国加紧搜罗侵朝战争炮灰
    【新华社五日讯】美国侵略者一面策划在全亚洲扩大侵略，一面加紧搜罗为继续和扩大朝鲜战争所需要的炮灰。美国陆军部部长弗兰克·佩斯在本月一日宣布，美国陆军打算迅速装备李承晚伪军，并训练李伪军的军官，以便尽速地和更多地利用他们来进行战争。
    但是美国侵略者自己也知道李伪军并不能给美国军队替死。十二月一日的美国“生活”杂志承认，如果让李伪军去单独作战，其结果必然是李承晚傀儡政权的崩溃。美国国会众议院军事小组委员会在去年十二月三十日提出的报告也反对将美国军队撤出朝鲜，它除了要求训练更多的李承晚伪军而外，还要求把国民党匪军调到朝鲜去作战，并要求“多利用亚洲人来执行他们自己的军事任务”。
    为了实现这个“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。美国侵略者已经要李匪承晚到日本去进行所谓“访问”。据合众社东京一日电报道，日本方面引用“外国人士”的话说，李承晚“访问”的目的，是打算和吉田反动政府“就日本部队参加朝鲜战争问题进行谈判”，并设法强迫在日本的朝鲜人参加李伪军。
    美国侵略者同时也准备对它的仆从国家施用压力，要他们更积极地参加美国的军事冒险。美联社记者约翰·海托华在去年十二月二十八日报道说，艾森豪威尔为了实现其扩大侵略亚洲的“更急进的战略”，将要求各仆从国家“尽更大的力量与冒更大的危险”。将要出任美国国会参议院外交委员会主席的共和党参议员维利，在去年十二月二十九日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”上，公开宣称美国政府应该要求所谓“盟国”拿出更多的人力物力来参加侵略朝鲜的战争。他要求这些“盟国”对于美国的侵略措施表示更大的关心和更多的帮助；他说，“这是绝对必要的”。
