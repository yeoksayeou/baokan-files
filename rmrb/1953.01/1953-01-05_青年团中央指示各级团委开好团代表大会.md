    Xinhua News Agency: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League recently issued instructions on holding good Communist Youth League representative conferences at all levels. The instructions stated: "Before the Second National Congress of the Communist Youth League in 1952, all localities will convene congresses of Communist Youth League representatives. This is an important measure to further implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Communist Youth League, strengthen work, promote democracy, and improve leadership. All levels of the Communist Youth League Committee must treat it as a major task and do it conscientiously." The instructions stipulate that before convening the representative conferences, all localities should fully prepare for the following tasks: (1) Conduct education on democratic centralism within the Communist Youth League, select representatives well, and the representatives to the conference must be fully representative. Appropriate consideration should be given to ensuring that representatives from different regions, units, ethnic groups, genders, occupations, and Young Pioneer team instructors participate. All representatives must be elected (there should be no ex-officio representatives who are not elected); (2) Under the leadership of the corresponding Party committee, correctly determine the central topics of the conference, and prepare the work report and draft resolutions for the representative conference as early as possible and distribute them to the lower levels before the meeting; (3) Widely solicit criticisms and suggestions from both inside and outside the Communist Youth League. The instructions pointed out that democracy must be fully promoted in the representative conference, and criticism and self-criticism must be carried out correctly. The representative conference must solve practical problems and avoid formalism. Before and during the meeting, the Party committee should be consulted. The higher-level Communist Youth League Committee should also send representatives to attend and provide guidance as much as possible. Before universally convening representative conferences in each province, city, and county, the higher-level Communist Youth League Committee should first assist the lower-level Communist Youth League Committee in holding representative conferences in one or two units to gain experience and then gradually promote it.

    青年团中央指示各级团委开好团代表大会
    【新华社讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会最近发布关于开好各级团代表大会的指示。指示说：“在一九五二年全国第二次团代表大会之前，各地都将召开团的代表大会，这是进一步贯彻团的三中全会决议、加强工作、发扬民主、改进领导的一项重要措施。各级团委均必须把它当作一件重大工作去做，并认真做好。”指示规定各地在召开代表大会之前，应充分做好下列准备工作：（一）进行团内民主集中制的教育，把代表选好，大会代表必须具有充分的代表性，应适当地照顾到不同地区、单位、民族、性别、职业以及少年儿童队辅导员等方面均有代表参加。所有代表均须经过选举产生（不能有不经选举的当然代表）；（二）在同级党委的领导下，正确地规定大会的中心议题，并将代表大会上的工作报告和决议草案及早准备好，于会前发给下面；（三）广泛征求团内外的批评和建议。指示指出：在代表大会中必须充分发扬民主，正确地开展批评与自我批评。代表大会必须解决实际问题，避免形式主义。会前会中，均应向党委请示。上级团委亦应尽可能派代表出席指导。在普遍召开各省、市、县代表大会之前，各上级团委应首先帮助下级团委开好一两个单位的代表大会，以便取得经验，然后逐步推广。
