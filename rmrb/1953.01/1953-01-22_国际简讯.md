　　The United States Forbids the Greek Government from Trading with People's Democracies

　　The Greek newspaper "Afgi" reported: The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has requested the cessation of all actions intended to establish or promote trade relations with Eastern European countries. Authorities have already ordered a ban on trade relations with Romania, despite the great interest of Greek business circles in trading with Romania.

　　"Afgi" said: This decision was taken at the request of the Americans.

　　Such is the "independent" decision taken by the Greek royalist fascist government.

　　American Bourgeois Newspapers Discuss the Reasons for American Soldiers' Desertion Again

　　The "Washington Times-Herald" published an editorial saying that the reason why so many soldiers in the United States Army are deserting is because the Korean War "does not arouse the enthusiasm of Americans." The "Louisville Times" recently published a third article on American soldiers' desertion. This article pointed out that although the U.S. government spends an average of $10,000 per soldier each year, "in the United States, even spending billions of dollars cannot build a well-disciplined military machine."

    美国禁止希腊政府和人民民主国家进行贸易
    希腊“阿佛其报”报道：希腊外交部要求停止打算建立或促进和东欧各国的贸易关系的一切行动。当局已经下令禁止和罗马尼亚的贸易关系，尽管希腊商界人士对于和罗马尼亚进行贸易极感兴趣。
    “阿佛其报”说：这个决定是在美国人要求之下采取的。
    希腊保皇法西斯政府所采取的“独立”决定就是如此。
    美国资产阶级报纸再论美军士兵逃跑原因
    “华盛顿时代先驱报”发表社论说，美国陆军中所以有许多士兵逃跑，是因为朝鲜战争“引不起美国人的热情”。“路易斯维尔时报”最近刊载了关于美国士兵逃跑事件的第三篇文章。这篇文章指出，尽管美国政府每年在每个军人身上平均要花费一万美元，但是，“在美国，就是花亿万美元也不能建立起纪律良好的军事机器。”
