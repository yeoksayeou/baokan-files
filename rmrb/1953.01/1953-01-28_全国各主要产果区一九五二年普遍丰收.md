In 1952, all major fruit production areas across the country experienced universal bumper harvests. In the Northeast region's Liaodong, the East China region's Zhejiang and Shandong, the Central South region's Jiangxi and Guangdong, and the Northwest region's Xinjiang, the output of fruit products last year increased by an average of about 50% compared to 1951, with the highest increase reaching 250%.

The output of apples, a major fruit product, increased by 50% compared to 1951. Liaodong Province in Northeast China produced 71,000 tons of apples last year, an increase of 50.6% compared to 1951. Weihai City in Shandong Province had a total apple output of about 60 tons last year, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1951. "Yantai Apples" in Fushan County, Shandong Province, and Changli County, Hebei Province, also had bumper harvests.

The output of citrus fruits increased even more in 1952. The output of Guanggan (sweet oranges) and red tangerines in Sichuan Province has exceeded pre-war levels. The total output of Guanggan and red tangerines in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, increased by 100% compared to 1951, with Guanggan output increasing by 250%. Huangyan honey tangerines produced on both banks of the Chengjiang River in Zhejiang Province, which are famous throughout the country, and Nanfeng honey tangerines in Jiangxi Province, also had bumper harvests. Huangyan County experienced a honey tangerine harvest unseen in decades, with an average yield of 1,547 jin per mu. In 1952, Jiangxi Province produced a total of 14 million jin of Nanfeng honey tangerines, Sanhu red tangerines, and Suichuan kumquats, exceeding the total output of 1951 by 150%.

The harvests of other fruits such as pears and grapes were also very good. Laiyang Chili pears, famous throughout the country, had a total output of more than 3 million jin in 1952, an increase of 30% compared to 1951. The seedless grapes in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang experienced their first major harvest after liberation in 1952. Each bunch of grapes weighed about two jin; it is estimated that the more than 20,000 mu of vineyards in the entire basin can produce 25 million jin of fresh grapes, an increase of 35% compared to 1951.

One of the important reasons for the bumper harvest of fruit products in major production areas is the strong support of local people's governments for fruit production. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient production funds for fruit farmers, the people's governments of major fruit production areas have issued various production loans through state banks. Fruit farmers in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, one of the major Guanggan production areas, received more than 217 million yuan in pruning and fertilization loans from the local people's government in 1952. Fruit farmers in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, lacked insecticides and sprayers, and the local people's government solved this problem by providing a loan of 50 million yuan. In order to solve the difficulties faced by farmers during the lean season, supply and marketing cooperatives in Turpan, Xinjiang, and other places pre-purchased 42,000 jin of grapes from fruit farmers.

In 1952, the people's governments of major fruit production areas vigorously imparted techniques related to pruning and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests to fruit farmers. In the past, apple rot and insect pests (codling moths) in the apple production areas of Northeast China were very serious. Thanks to the joint prevention and control efforts of the local people's government's agricultural departments and the masses, they have been greatly reduced. Under the technical guidance of the local fruit tree guidance station, fruit farmers in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, generally carried out reasonable pruning, cultivating, weeding, fertilization, and pest control.

State-owned trading departments led cooperatives and private merchants in purchasing large quantities of fruit products in the production areas and promoting them domestically and internationally in a planned manner, which stabilized the price of fruit products after the bumper harvest and guaranteed the income of fruit farmers.

After the universal bumper harvest in various production areas, it is very important to allow fruit trees to recover and prevent alternate bearing. At present, various fruit production areas are seizing the time to properly carry out winter orchard management work and strive for an even greater harvest this year.

### 全国各主要产果区一九五二年普遍丰收

    全国各主要产果区一九五二年普遍丰收
    一九五二年全国各主要产果区普遍丰收。东北区的辽东，华东区的浙江、山东，中南区的江西、广东和西北区的新疆等地，去年果品的产量平均比一九五一年增产约百分之五十，最高的增产达百分之二百五十。
    主要果品中的苹果，比一九五一年增产百分之五十。东北辽东省去年的苹果产量是七万一千吨，比一九五一年增产百分之五十点六。山东威海市去年的苹果总产量约六十吨，比一九五一年增产百分之四十以上。山东省福山县和河北省昌黎县等地的“烟台苹果”也都丰收。
    一九五二年柑桔的产量增加更多。四川省广柑（甜橙）和红橘的产量已超过战前水平。该省金堂县广柑、红橘的总产量比一九五一年增加一倍，其中广柑的产量增加二倍半。闻名全国的浙江省澄江两岸所产的黄岩蜜橘和江西南丰蜜桔也都丰收。黄岩县蜜橘的丰收是数十年来没有过的，平均每亩产一千五百四十七斤。江西省的南丰蜜桔、三湖红橘和遂川金橘等一九五二年共产一千四百万斤，超过一九五一年总产量一倍半。
    其他果品如梨、葡萄等的收成也都很好。驰名全国的山东莱阳茌梨，一九五二年总产量达三百多万斤，比一九五一年增产百分之三十。新疆吐鲁番盆地的无核葡萄，一九五二年获得解放后的第一次大丰收。每串葡萄重二斤左右；估计全盆地两万多亩葡萄园，可产鲜葡萄两千五百万斤，比一九五一年增产百分之三十五。
    各主要产果区果品丰收的重要原因之一，是各地人民政府对果品生产的大力扶植。各主要产果区人民政府为了解决果农生产资金不足的困难，曾通过国家银行发放了各种生产贷款。广柑主要产区之一四川江津县的果农，一九五二年得到当地人民政府发放的修枝施肥贷款二亿一千七百多万元。山东莱阳县果农缺乏杀虫药械，当地人民政府贷款五千万元解决了这个问题。新疆吐鲁番等地的供销合作社为了解决农民青黄不接的困难，向果农预购了四万二千斤葡萄。
    各主要产果区人民政府一九五二年曾大力向果农传授关于剪枝、防除病虫害的技术。过去东北苹果产区的苹果腐烂病和虫害（食心虫）非常严重，由于当地人民政府农业部门配合群众共同防治，已大为减轻。山东莱阳县的果农，在当地果树指导所的技术指导下，一般都进行了合理剪枝、修锄、施肥和除虫。
    国营贸易部门领导合作社和私商在产果区大量收购并有计划地向国内外推销，使丰收后的果品价格稳定，这对果农的收益起了保证作用。
    在各产果区普遍丰收以后，如何使果树得以恢复生息，防止隔年结果，是一件很重要的事情。目前各产果区正抓紧时间，妥善进行冬季果园管理工作，争取今年更大的丰收。
