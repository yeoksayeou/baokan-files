Truman's New Budget is a Budget for Continuing Arms Expansion and War Preparations

The outgoing American President Truman, in his "Budget Message" to the US Congress on January 9th, proposed the total expenditure figure for the 1953-1954 fiscal year. As even the official American news agencies have admitted, this is a "record-breaking figure."

According to the budget proposed by Truman, the total expenditure of the United States in the 1953-54 fiscal year will reach $78.6 billion, about $4 billion more than the estimated expenditure for this year. Almost all of the increase in total expenditure is due to increased military spending. The military expenditure of the United States in the next year will be $57.3 billion, accounting for 73 percent of the total expenditure. If combined with war-related expenses, this total military expenditure will account for 83 percent of the total expenditure. Truman wants to maintain America's false prosperity by stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, but facts have proven that the result of the militarization of the American economy has made the gap between the abnormally developed industrial production and the ever-shrinking purchasing power of the people more serious. American industrial production has begun to show a trend of stagnation and decline, and even launching the war of aggression against Korea has failed to save America's economic crisis. Even Truman's economic advisors admit that an economic panic in the United States is inevitable. The ever-increasing military budget can only accelerate the arrival of the crisis.

Truman's new budget means higher profits for American monopoly capitalists, but heavier tax burdens for the American people. According to the tax revenue stipulated in the budget, the average American will bear about $481. In fact, the huge military burden mainly falls on the shoulders of the working people, because the taxes paid by monopoly enterprises are ultimately passed on to the vast consumers, which shows that the lives of the American people will be further deteriorated. Moreover, Truman believes that the current high tax revenue cannot make up for the budget deficit, and to maintain the balance of payments, taxes must be increased again. Therefore, Truman asked the American people to "make some sacrifices" in his message.

Truman greatly boasted about the US government's "welfare plan" in his message, hypocritically rattling off a long list of figures to show his "caring for the people." But the most convincing thing is the amount of civilian expenditure in the new budget. In this budget with such a large figure, civilian expenditure only accounts for 17 percent, and only over $2.5 billion is used for welfare, accounting for only a little over 3 percent of the total expenditure. In the United States, there are more than 10 million people who rely on unemployment relief to maintain their lives, 10 million families owe doctors' consultation fees, and 3.5 million families live in dilapidated houses. Such a budget expenditure undeniably shows how the loyal servants of Wall Street have squeezed the blood and sweat of the working people to support a small group of insatiable monopoly capitalists, regardless of the life and death of the vast majority of people.

The policies executed by Truman in the past, branded with the "Democratic Party" trademark, were Wall Street's policies, and therefore, in essence, were also the Republican Party's policies, because they both followed the will of the same boss. If there is any difference between Eisenhower's policies and Truman's, it is that they are more reactionary and more enthusiastic about expanding the war. Therefore, although the Republican members are now hypocritically clamoring for "budget cuts," the facts will ruthlessly tear off their masks quickly. The heavy pressure of military spending and taxes that Eisenhower has added to the American people will certainly be heavier than what Truman had added. The "tax reduction" lies he made during the election will prove to be worthless.

### 杜鲁门的新预算是继续进行扩军备战的预算

    杜鲁门的新预算是继续进行扩军备战的预算
    即将卸任的美国总统杜鲁门，在他一月九日向美国国会提出的“预算咨文”中，提出了一九五三—一九五四会计年度开支总额的数字，这个数字，正如美国官方通讯社所承认的，是一个“创纪录的数字”。
    根据杜鲁门所提出的预算，美国在一九五三—五四会计年度的开支总额共达七百八十六亿美元，比本年度的支出概算约多四十亿美元。支出总额的增加几乎全部是由于增加军事费用的缘故。下一年度美国的军事费用共五百七十三亿美元，占总支出的百分之七十三，如果和与战争有关的费用合计起来，这个军事性支出总和将占总支出的百分之八十三。杜鲁门想以加紧扩军备战来维持美国的虚假繁荣，但是事实证明：美国经济军事化的结果，使畸形发展的工业生产和日益缩小的人民购买力之间的脱节现象更加严重，美国的工业生产已开始显露停滞和下降的趋势，发动侵朝战争也未能挽救美国的经济危机。连杜鲁门的经济顾问也承认：美国的经济恐慌不可避免。一年比一年庞大的军事预算，只能加速危机的到来。
    杜鲁门的新预算，对于美国的垄断资本家是意味着更高的利润，对于美国人民则意味着更深重的捐税负担。按照预算规定的税收，美国人民每人平均将担负约四百八十一美元。而且实际上庞大的军事负担主要是落在劳动人民的肩上，因为垄断企业所缴纳的捐税最后还是转嫁给广大的消费者的，这就说明了美国人民的生活将更进一步的恶化。况且杜鲁门认为目前的高额税收还不能弥补预算的赤字，要维持收支的平衡，必须再增加捐税。所以杜鲁门在其咨文中要美国人民“还要作些牺牲”。
    杜鲁门在他的咨文中曾大大吹嘘美国政府的“福利计划”，伪善地开了一大串数字来表明他“爱护人民的心思”。但是最有说服力的却是新预算中民用开支的数目。在这个如此庞大数字的预算中，民用开支只占到百分之十七，而其中用于福利事业上的只有二十五亿余美元，仅占开支总额的百分之三强。而在美国要靠领失业救济金维持生活的就有一千多万人，有一千万个家庭欠着医生的诊疗费，有三百五十万个家庭住在破烂的房子里。这样的预算开支无可置辩地说明了华尔街的忠仆是如何榨取了劳动人民的血汗，去供养一小撮贪得无厌的垄断资本家，而不顾广大人民的死活。
    杜鲁门过去所执行的印着“民主党”商标的政策就是华尔街的政策，因此实际上也就是共和党的政策，因为它们都奉行同一个老板的意旨。如果说艾森豪威尔的政策和杜鲁门的有什么不同，那就是更加反动，更热中于扩大战争。因此，尽管现在共和党的议员们在伪善地高呼“削减预算”，但事实会无情地很快撕破他们的假面具。艾森豪威尔加到美国人民身上去的军费和捐税的重压，一定比杜鲁门曾经加上去的更为沉重。他在竞选时所作的“减低捐税”的鬼话，事实将证明是不值半文钱的。
