State-owned Central China Steel Company
    Cultivates a Large Number of Geological Surveying Technicians
    The engineering geological surveying department of the state-owned Central China Steel Company, adopting the principle of "learning by doing," rapidly cultivated a large number of geological surveying technicians and skilled workers, enabling them to complete the annual work tasks a month ahead of schedule last year.

    According to the provisions of the national plan, Central China Steel Company is to build many large-scale factories. Surveying the factory foundations for these factories is an arduous task. According to needs, the company planned to survey three factory areas within eight months. According to general estimates, completing this task would require forty technicians and three hundred skilled drilling workers to work simultaneously. However, the strength undertaking this task was very weak at the time. When the company's engineering geology team was formally established in June last year, it had more than five hundred people, of whom, apart from eight skilled workers and seven technicians, were all junior middle school students and demobilized soldiers. However, after half a year of field study and training, many trainees and new workers have become excellent geological workers. Many demobilized soldiers have become second to fourth grade drilling workers. They not only mastered the performance of the drilling rigs, but also can work under various geological conditions. Forty junior middle school trainees have learned to make soil records, and seven of them can draw general columnar geological maps. In the laboratory, twenty-eight trainees have become formal soil testers, and can independently complete twenty specimens a day. The rapid growth of the geological surveying force has enabled them to survey an area of ​​54 square kilometers, with a cumulative drilling depth of 3,816 meters, and 7,624 soil samples taken. The testing personnel completed 140 undisturbed soil, 256 disturbed soil specimens, and 304 natural water content tests. The quality of drilling and testing work all fully met technical standards. For example, various figures in soil tests have been repeatedly checked three times, proving that there were no errors at all. These work results have been written into detailed reports and have become a reliable basis for designing the foundations of new factories.

    国营华中钢铁公司
    培养出大批地质勘测技术人员
    国营华中钢铁公司工程地质勘测部门，采用“边学边做”的方针，迅速培养出大批地质勘测的技术人员和技工，使去年全年工作任务提前一个月完成。
    根据国家计划的规定，华中钢铁公司要兴建许多规模巨大的工厂。为这些工厂勘测厂基，是一个艰巨的任务。根据需要，该公司计划要在八个月内勘测三个厂区，据一般估计，要完成这个任务需要四十个技术人员和三百个熟练钻探工人同时进行工作。但是担负这个任务的力量，当时却十分薄弱。去年六月，该公司工程地质队正式成立时，共有五百多人，其中除八个熟练工人和七个技术人员外，都是初中程度的学生和转业战士。但是，经过半年的实地学习和锻炼，很多练习生和新工人都变成了优秀的地质工作者。很多转业战士，变成了二级到四级的钻探工人。他们不仅掌握了钻机的性能，而且可以在各种地质条件下进行工作。四十个初中程度的练习生，学会了作土壤记录，其中并有七个人可以绘制一般的柱状地质图。在试验室里，二十八个练习生成了正式土壤试验员，一天可以独立完成二十个标本。地质勘测力量的迅速成长，使他们勘测了五十四平方公里的地区，钻进深度累计达三千八百一十六公尺，取出土样七千六百二十四个。试验人员们，完成了一百四十个原状土、二百五十六个扰动土的标本和三百零四个天然含水量的试验。钻探和试验工作的质量，都完全合乎技术标准。如土壤试验的各种数字，曾反复核对三次，证明完全没有差错。他们这些工作成果，已写成了详细的报告，成为设计新建工厂地基时的可靠依据。
