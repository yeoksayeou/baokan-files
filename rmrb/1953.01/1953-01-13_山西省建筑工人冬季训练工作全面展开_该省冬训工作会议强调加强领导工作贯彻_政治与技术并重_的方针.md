Winter training of construction workers in Shanxi Province has been fully launched. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government convened a meeting on December 28th of last year with responsible cadres from state-owned and local state-owned construction units and state-owned factories and mines with long-term fixed construction workers to study issues in the winter training of construction workers.

Thanks to the importance attached to the winter training work by leaders in most units, some achievements have already been made in the winter training of construction workers in Shanxi Province. All units have conducted political education using methods such as large-scale reports, lectures, seminars, discussions, and comparisons between the old and new societies, tailored to the ideological situation of the construction workers. Most of the trainees have a high enthusiasm for learning. Some veteran workers who have been oppressed and exploited by the Kuomintang and feudal foremen for a long time have gained a deeper understanding of the benefits of the new society during their studies, enhancing their confidence and determination to build the motherland, and unanimously expressed their intention to study hard, improve their political awareness and technical level during the winter training. This has laid a preliminary ideological foundation for doing a good job in winter training.

There are still some problems in the winter training work in Shanxi Province. Leaders of individual units have an insufficient understanding of the importance of winter training work and have not treated winter training work as an important task; some units are not clear about the principles and objectives of winter training, and have not implemented the policy of "equal emphasis on political education and technical education," but instead are conducting cultural education. At present, some workers still have ideological concerns and cannot concentrate on their studies. For example, some workers have not yet realized the benefits of participating in learning, and according to past habits, believe that "after working for a year, they should go home and enjoy a few days of leisure." Some workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of industrializing construction workers, and have not unified national interests with personal interests, fearing that they will not be able to freely choose higher-paying units after becoming fixed workers; some are afraid of being transferred to work far away after becoming fixed workers.

The Shanxi Provincial Construction Workers Winter Training Work Conference listened to the reports of various units and discussed the above issues. Finally, Pei Lisheng, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, gave instructions on the winter training work. Pei Lisheng first pointed out that leaders of all units must correctly understand the relationship between the winter training work of construction workers and large-scale capital construction. The capital construction task in 1953 is huge. If various units cannot train fixed construction workers into a strong force in a very short period of time, and transform them into the backbone of the construction team, they will not be able to complete the capital construction task in 1953. Then, he analyzed the ideological characteristics of construction workers, pointing out that transforming construction workers who are semi-agricultural and semi-industrial, who have been engaged in handicraft production for a long time, and whose thinking is generally more conservative and backward, into long-term fixed workers with organization, discipline, and collectivism will be an arduous ideological struggle. If we cannot grasp this characteristic of construction workers, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and specifically resolve ideological concerns to make them feel at ease in their studies, the work of fixing workers cannot be considered successful. Therefore, leaders of all units must strengthen their leadership over winter training work. First of all, there must be a strong leadership organization, and each city and district should organize a unified winter training leadership organization. Secondly, the content of winter training must implement the policy of "equal emphasis on politics and technology," and generally not conduct cultural studies. According to local experience, it takes four hundred hours to consolidate the quick literacy method. Conducting cultural learning in a very short period of time will inevitably not be done well, resulting in the winter training work failing to achieve the expected goals. Regarding the progress and teaching methods of winter training, Pei Lisheng pointed out: We must first enable everyone to recognize the significance of fixing workers, recognize the needs of national construction and their own future through comparisons between the old and new societies. Then, on this basis, vigorously carry out technical education, so that workers can master certain skills and learn decisive advanced experiences through winter training. Technical education must be closely linked to reality, implement the spirit of "learning what you do," and must be based on different types of work and positions, focusing on key areas for learning. For example, bricklayers should focus on learning Su Changyou's bricklaying method, carpenters should focus on learning Xie Wanfu's assembly line operation method, and managers should focus on learning how to organize rhythmic production according to instruction charts. In addition, attention must be paid to the learning of special technologies (such as mechanical operation, water and electricity heating installation, etc.). The learning method should focus on on-site demonstrations and internships to achieve the purpose of practical application in construction.

    山西省建筑工人冬季训练工作全面展开
    该省冬训工作会议强调加强领导工作贯彻“政治与技术并重”的方针
    山西省建筑工人冬季训练工作已经全面展开。山西省人民政府于去年十二月二十八日召集山西各国营及地方国营建筑单位及有长期固定建筑工人的国营厂矿负责干部开会，研究了建筑工人冬训工作中的问题。
    山西省建筑工人冬训工作，由于大多数单位领导干部都很重视，已做出了一些成绩。各单位都针对建筑工人思想情况，用大会报告、讲课、座谈、讨论和新旧对比等方式进行了政治教育。大部分受训工人学习情绪都很高。一部分过去长期受国民党和封建把头压迫剥削的老工人，在学习中更深刻地体会到新社会的好处，提高了建设祖国的信心和决心，一致表示要在冬训中努力学习，提高政治觉悟和技术水平。这给做好冬训工作打下了初步的思想基础。
    山西省冬训工作中还存在一些问题。个别单位的领导干部对冬训工作的重要性认识不足，没有把冬训工作当成一个重要任务去做；有的单位对冬训的方针和目的不明确，没有贯彻“政治教育和技术教育并重”的方针，而是进行文化教育。目前工人中也还有一些思想顾虑，不能安心学习。如有的工人还没有认识到参加学习的好处，根据过去习惯，认为“做工一年了，应回家过两天闲日子”。有的工人对建筑业工人产业化的重要性认识不足，国家利益和个人利益没有统一起来，怕固定后不能随便挑选工资高的单位；有的怕固定后要调到远处去做工。
    山西省建筑工人冬训工作会议，听取了各单位的汇报，对上述问题进行了讨论。最后，山西省人民政府主席裴丽生对冬训工作作了指示。裴丽生首先指出：各单位领导干部必须正确地认识建筑工人冬训工作与大规模基本建设的关系。一九五三年的基本建设任务是巨大的。各单位如果不能在很短的时间内把固定的建筑工人训练成一批坚强的战士，使其变成建筑队伍中的骨干力量，就将不能完成一九五三年的基本建设任务。接着他分析了建筑工人的思想特点，指出：把半农半工、长期进行手工业生产、思想一般比较保守落后的建筑工人变成长期固定的有组织、有纪律和集体主义的工人，将是一个艰巨的思想斗争过程。如果不能抓住建筑工人的这个特点，加强政治思想领导，具体解决思想顾虑使其安心学习，固定工人的工作就不能算成功。因此，各单位领导干部必须加强对冬训工作的领导。首先要有坚强的领导机构，各市区应组织统一的冬训领导机构。其次，冬训内容必须贯彻“政治与技术并重”的方针，一般不进行文化学习。根据各地经验，速成识字法要做到巩固需要四百个小时的时间。在很短的时间内进行文化学习，势必办不好，结果使冬训工作达不到预期的目的。关于冬训的进度与教学方法，裴丽生指出：要首先通过新旧社会对比使大家认识到固定工人的意义，认识到国家建设的需要和自己的前途。然后在这个基础上大力进行技术教育，使工人们能通过冬训掌握一定的技术，学会有决定性的先进经验。技术教育必须密切联系实际，贯彻“做啥学啥”的精神，必须根据不同的工种和职务，抓住重点进行学习。如瓦工要重点学习苏长有砌砖法，木工要重点学习谢万福流水作业法，管理人员要重点学习按指示图表组织有节奏的生产。此外，并须注意特种技术（如机械操作、水电暖气安装等）的学习。学习方法应着重现场表演和实习，以达到在施工中能实际运用的目的。
