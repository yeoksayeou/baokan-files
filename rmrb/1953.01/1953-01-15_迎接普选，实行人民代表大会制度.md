    Based on the suggestions submitted by the Chinese Communist Party to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and then to the Central People's Government Committee in December last year, the 20th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the "Resolution on Convening the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels," scheduling for this year "the convocation of people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels, generated through universal suffrage by the people, and on this basis, the subsequent convocation of the National People's Congress. At this congress, a constitution will be formulated, the outline of the national five-year construction plan will be approved, and a new Central People's Government will be elected." Simultaneously, it was resolved to establish a Constitution Drafting Committee and an Election Law Drafting Committee to commence work. This resolution signifies that our nation's New Democratic political power construction is about to enter a more complete and consolidated stage. This marks the beginning of a new and tremendous development in the political life of our entire nation.

    This new political life is unprecedented in Chinese history, made possible only by the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution today. Prior to this, the Chinese people's struggle for democratic "constitutionalism" had endured a long and arduous battle spanning half a century. The reformists of the late Qing Dynasty, such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, believed that "China can only have constitutionalism, not revolution." Therefore, their "constitutional monarchy" movement, after countless acts of kneeling and petitioning, only resulted in the empty words of a "nine-year preparatory constitutionalism" and a "Constitution Outline Granted by the Emperor." Mr. Sun Yat-sen recognized the truth that "there can be no constitutionalism without revolution," and led the Xinhai Revolution, formulating the famous "Provisional Constitution" during the revolution. However, since there was no thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution at the time, it allowed the Northern Warlord Yuan Shikai to tear up the "Provisional Constitution," dissolve the parliament, and don the "Hongxian" imperial robe. Learning from the lessons of numerous revolutionary failures, Mr. Sun Yat-sen accepted the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, reorganized the Kuomintang, and established the revolution's "Three Great Policies." But when the First Revolutionary Civil War was achieving successive victories, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed it, causing serious setbacks to the Chinese revolution. For nearly twenty years, the Chinese people fought for democracy against the Kuomintang reactionary government, opposing the shackles of the so-called "Tutelage Period Provisional Constitution" and the long-term deceptive empty words of the so-called "May Fifth Draft Constitution." During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, the Chinese people continued to carry out the democratic constitutionalism movement; however, the Kuomintang reactionary government remained unwilling to implement even a shred of democracy, staging an ugly farce of a bogus National Assembly and bogus constitution on the eve of its final collapse, and then swiftly perished.

    The Chinese people, after half a century of struggle, fully understand that to realize true democratic constitutionalism, it is necessary to carry out a great people's revolution and overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people finally carried out this revolution and achieved a great victory. Because of this victory, the Chinese people were able to establish a New Democratic, i.e., People's Democratic, state, and, after only three years, it became possible to implement a system of People's Congresses elected by universal suffrage.

    The system of People's Congresses elected by universal suffrage is the basic system of our country and the basic organizational form of our New Democratic, i.e., People's Democratic, political power. Article 12 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that "the highest organ of state power is the National People's Congress"; Article 14 stipulates that "universal suffrage should be implemented and local people's congresses should be convened in areas where military operations have completely ended, land reform has been thoroughly implemented, and people from all walks of life are fully organized." Article 2 of the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China also stipulates that "the government of the People's Republic of China is a People's Congress system government based on the principle of democratic centralism." These articles all point out that the system of People's Congresses elected by universal suffrage is the basic organizational form of our state power. Article 13 of the Common Program stipulates that "before the convocation of the National People's Congress elected by universal suffrage, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference shall exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress"; Article 14 stipulates that "before the convocation of local people's congresses elected by universal suffrage, the local people's representative conferences of all circles shall gradually exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congresses." These articles indicate the transitional forms that should be adopted when the conditions for implementing the system of People's Congresses elected by universal suffrage are not yet in place. Adopting this transitional form is entirely necessary. These transitional forms are necessary under conditions where the revolutionary war has not yet completely ended, land reform has not yet been thoroughly implemented, and the people have not yet been fully organized; they are also necessary for preparing for the implementation of the People's Congress system.

    Of course, transitional forms cannot be perfect forms. Now, after three years of united effort by the people throughout the country, the conditions for implementing the system of People's Congresses elected by universal suffrage are in place, and we should replace the transitional forms with the basic organizational form of our state power. Implementing the system of People's Congresses elected by universal suffrage means that the people can fully and freely elect those they consider best and most necessary to their national and local organs of power, according to their own will, while also ensuring that those they are dissatisfied with are no longer elected to these organs. This will further empower the people to become the masters of the national and local organs of power, making it easier for them to remove all obstacles that prevent them from becoming the masters. Therefore, this will greatly enhance the people's revolutionary enthusiasm, greatly strengthen the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, greatly strengthen the power of economic construction, and greatly strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea.

    Now, all the people of our country should act actively based on the resolution passed by the Central People's Government Committee and earnestly prepare for this universal democratic election movement. Our people, in the three years of democratic life, have already gained experience in conducting democratic elections. Generally, more than 80% of the representatives to people's representative conferences at all levels in most areas, directly and indirectly elected by the people, have already been elected, and in some areas, it has reached more than 90%. This proves that we are fully prepared to implement universal suffrage throughout the country. However, because this election is a national universal suffrage, we must do it even more carefully. All patriotic people must pay close attention and elect those who they are truly satisfied with and consider necessary to be people's representatives and members of the People's Government; we must never allow any bad elements to infiltrate the organs of the People's Congresses and People's Governments at all levels. In the election, we must unite all patriots; and we must resolutely expose and expel those who are unpatriotic and counter-revolutionary. We should elect representatives from all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations in the country who are representative, enthusiastic about the people's cause, and have the correct attitude towards the masses; in particular, we should elect heroes and model figures from the broad masses of people who have made significant achievements. That is to say, our election is to ensure that the people, especially the working people, can truly elect those they are willing to elect to represent themselves; at the same time, it is to ensure that the elected representatives can truly represent the opinions and demands of the people and reflect them in the organs of the people's power.

    Doing a good job in such a universal suffrage is undoubtedly an arduous task. The key to completing this task lies in correctly leading the elections in the townships and counties. There are currently more than 280,000 townships and 2,174 counties (including administrative units equivalent to counties) in the country. The township is the basic unit of our country in the vast countryside, and the county is the basic link in leading the people in the countryside. And the people in the countryside not only account for the vast majority of our country's population, but also, because of their relatively low level of culture, conducting elections among them is undoubtedly more difficult. Therefore, if the work in the townships and counties is done well, it means that all the work is fundamentally done well.

    In order to do a good job in the election work in the townships and counties, as well as the election work at other levels, we hope that the Election Law Drafting Committee established by the Central People's Government Committee will complete the drafting work as soon as possible, and we hope that the Central People's Government Committee will publish it as soon as possible. Before the start of universal suffrage, a huge and intense preparatory work is obviously needed, including the training of election staff, the investigation of the population, the investigation and registration of voters, the widespread publicity of the meaning and methods of election, the nomination and introduction of candidates, and so on. Only by timely and conscientiously carrying out this series of preparatory work can we victoriously complete this great construction task of our people's democratic power, led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes and nationalities in the country and overseas Chinese.

### 迎接普选，实行人民代表大会制度

    迎接普选，实行人民代表大会制度
    根据中国共产党去年十二月提交中国人民政治协商会议向中央人民政府委员会提出的建议，中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议通过了“关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议”，定于今年“召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会。在这次大会上，将制定宪法，批准国家五年建设计划纲要和选举新的中央人民政府。”同时决议成立宪法起草委员会和选举法起草委员会，开始工作。这个决议，表示我国新民主主义的政权建设，即将进入一个更加完备、更加巩固的阶段。这是我们全国人民政治生活中的一个新的巨大发展的开端。
    这个新的政治生活，在中国历史上是空前未有的，这只有在中国人民革命取得伟大胜利后的今天，才是可能的。在这以前，中国人民争取民主的“宪政运动”，曾经历了半个世纪漫长岁月的艰苦斗争。满清末年的康有为、梁启超等改良派认为“中国只可立宪，不能革命”，因此，他们的“君主立宪”运动经过无数次的下跪上书，只换得“九年预备立宪”和一部“钦定宪法大纲”的空文。孙中山先生看到了“不革命决不能立宪”的道理，领导了辛亥革命，并在革命中制定了著名的“临时约法”。但是，当时既然没有彻底的反帝反封建的革命，这就使北洋军阀袁世凯能够撕毁“临时约法”，解散国会，穿起“洪宪”的龙袍。受到多次革命失败的教训，孙中山先生才接受了中国共产党的主张，改组了国民党，确定了革命的“三大政策”。但在第一次国内革命战争节节胜利的时候，蒋介石叛变了，又使中国革命受到了严重的挫折。近二十年来，中国人民向国民党反动政府争民主，反对国民党反动政府的所谓“训政时期约法”的枷锁及其长期欺骗人民的所谓“五五宪草”的纸上空文。在抗日战争和人民解放战争时期，中国人民继续进行了民主宪政运动；但是国民党反动政府仍然不肯实行半点的民主，直到它最后崩溃的前夕，扮演了一出伪国大、伪宪法的丑剧而迅速灭亡。
    中国人民经过半个世纪以来的斗争，完全懂得要实现真正的民主宪政，只有进行人民大革命，推翻帝国主义和国民党的反动统治。中国人民终于在中国共产党的领导之下，进行了这个革命，取得了伟大的胜利。由于这个胜利，中国人民才能够建立新民主主义即人民民主主义的国家，并且只经过了三年的时间，就有了可能，来实行普选的人民代表大会制度。
    普选的人民代表大会制度是我们国家的基本制度，是我国新民主主义即人民民主主义政权的基本组织形式。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十二条规定，“国家最高政权机关为全国人民代表大会”；第十四条规定，“凡在军事行动已经完全结束、土地改革已经彻底实现、各界人民已有充分组织的地方，即应实行普选，召开地方的人民代表大会。”中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法第二条也规定，“中华人民共和国政府是基于民主集中原则的人民代表大会制的政府。”这些条文都指明了普选的人民代表大会制度是我们国家政权的基本组织形式。共同纲领第十三条规定，“在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以前，由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行全国人民代表大会的职权”；第十四条规定，“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界人民代表会议逐步地代行人民代表大会的职权”。这些条文指明了在实行普选的人民代表大会制度的条件还不具备的情况下所应采取的过渡形式。采取这种过渡形式是完全必需的。这些过渡形式是在革命战争还没有完全结束，土地改革还没有彻底实现，人民群众还没有充分组织起来的条件下所必要的，也是为准备实施人民代表大会制度所必要的。
    当然，过渡的形式不会是完善的形式。现在，经过了我们全国上下三年来团结一致的努力，实行普选的人民代表大会制度的条件已经具备，我们就应该用我们国家政权的基本组织形式来代替过渡形式了。实行普选的人民代表大会制度，就是使人民可以充分地自由地按照自己的意志把自己认为是最好的和必要的人选到自己的国家政权机关和地方政权机关中去，同时使这些政权机关中自己所不满的人不再当选。这就是使人民进一步成为国家政权机关和地方政权机关的主人翁，使人民更容易有能力有便利扫除一切妨碍人民成为主人翁的障碍物。因此，这就是大大提高人民的革命积极性，这就是大大加强人民民主专政的力量，这就是大大加强经济建设的力量，这就是大大加强抗美援朝的力量。
    现在，我们全国人民都应该根据中央人民政府委员会通过的决议，积极行动起来，认真地准备这次普遍的民主选举运动。我国人民，在三年来的民主生活中，已经有了进行民主选举的经验。绝大多数地方各级人民代表会议的代表，由人民直接选举和间接选举的，一般都已达到了代表总数的百分之八十以上，有的已达百分之九十以上。这就证明了我们实行全国普选的条件是充分具备了的。但是，这次选举因为是全国的普选，所以还必须更加认真做好。一切爱国的人民都必须十分注意，把自己所真正满意的和认为必要的人选举出来，作为人民代表和人民政府的委员；决不能让任何坏分子混到各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府的机关中去。在选举中，对于一切爱国者，我们都要团结；对于不爱国的、反革命的分子，则必须坚决加以揭露和驱逐。我们应该把国内各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体中有代表性的、对人民事业具有热忱的、对待人民群众态度正确的人选举出来；尤其应该把广大人民群众中有显著成绩的英雄模范人物选举出来。这就是说，我们的选举是要使人民，主要是劳动人民，真正能够选举自己所乐意选举的人去代表自己；同时要使被选出的代表真正能够代表人民群众的意见和要求，把它反映到人民的政权机关中去。
    做好这样的普选工作，无疑地是一项艰巨的任务。完成这个任务的关键在于正确领导乡和县的选举。全国现有二十八万多个乡，二千一百七十四个县（包括相当于县的行政单位）。乡是我们国家在广大农村中的基层单位，县是领导乡村人民的基本环节。而乡村人民不但占我国人口的绝大多数，并且由于他们的文化水平比较低，在他们中间进行选举无疑是比较困难的。因此，乡和县的工作做好了，就是说全部的工作根本做好了。
    为了做好乡和县的选举工作以及其他各级的选举工作，我们希望中央人民政府委员会决议成立的选举法起草委员会，早日完成起草的工作，并且希望中央人民政府委员会早日加以公布。在普选开始以前，显然需要巨大的紧张的准备工作，包括选举工作人员的训练，人口的调查，选民的调查和登记，选举意义和选举办法的普遍宣传，候选人的提出和介绍等等。只有及时地认真地作好这一系列的准备工作，我们才能胜利地完成我国以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础、并团结各民主阶级和国内各民族和国外华侨的人民民主政权的这一个伟大建设任务。
