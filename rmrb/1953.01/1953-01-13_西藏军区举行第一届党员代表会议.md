Xinhua News Agency: The First Party Representative Conference of the Chinese Communist Party's Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region concluded on December 18, 1952, lasting eighteen days. Three hundred and thirty-eight party representatives from various units under the Tibet Military Region attended the conference.

The conference reviewed and summarized the work of the past three years since the entry into Tibet, with particular emphasis on examining the implementation of ethnic policies and production, construction, and other work. It discussed how to further establish the idea of long-term construction in Tibet within the troops and passed and determined the future work guidelines.

Over the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the direct command of the Southwest Military Region and Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the assistance of fraternal troops, the strong support and help of the broad masses of people in various regions, especially the Tibetan people in the Kangzang area, and the efforts of all commanders and fighters, the troops entering Tibet have completed the historical task of entering Tibet, thereby realizing the complete unification of the motherland's mainland, correctly implementing and publicizing Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's policies of ethnic equality, unity, and freedom of religious belief, as well as the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Under the call of opposing imperialism and loving the motherland, the troops entering Tibet have united the broad masses of Tibetan people, mediated internal disputes among the Tibetan people, and strengthened the unity within the Tibetan people.

In the past three years, with the help of the troops entering Tibet, a total of fourteen primary schools have been established, with more than 1,300 children enrolled. In addition, more than 400 Tibetan cadres have been trained, and Tibetan-language news briefs have been published in Lhasa and Xigaze. Medical staff from various units have established people's hospitals and clinics in Lhasa, Xigaze, Gyantse, Qamdo, Dingqing, and other places, providing free medical treatment to the Tibetan people.

All units strictly respected the customs and habits of the Tibetan people and used the gaps between military advances and production construction to help the local Tibetan people with harvesting, construction, sanitation, and other work. These actions have been warmly praised and supported by the broad masses of Tibetan people.

Under the slogan of "advancing while building," the troops constructed more than 1,100 kilometers of highway from Ya'an to Qamdo and reclaimed approximately 40,000 mu of wasteland, alleviating the burden on the people and ensuring the needs of the troops. These achievements have laid a good foundation for building a prosperous new Tibet and consolidating the western border defense line of the motherland in the future.

This conference determined the future work guidelines and ten main work tasks for 1953, including vigorously carrying out ethnic work, production construction, strengthening troops' cultural learning, and policy and discipline education. The conference pointed out that in future work, it is necessary to oppose the style of recklessness and impetuosity and the remnants of Great Han chauvinism, further investigate and study the actual situation in Tibet, and all work should proceed from the actual political, economic, cultural, and religious conditions of the Tibetan people, strictly respect the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, continue to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, strengthen the unity of the broad masses of Tibetan people, and vigorously cultivate Tibetan cadres, and develop Tibet's ethnic culture, education, and health undertakings in a planned and focused manner.

The delegates unanimously passed a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their determination to build Tibet for a long time.

    西藏军区举行第一届党员代表会议
    据新华社讯：中国共产党中国人民解放军西藏军区第一届党员代表会议，历时十八天，已于一九五二年十二月十八日闭幕。出席会议的有西藏军区所属各部队党员代表三百三十八名。
    会议检查和总结了进军西藏三年来的各项工作，特别着重检查了执行民族政策和生产、修建等工作；讨论了如何在部队中更进一步树立长期建设西藏的思想等问题；通过和确定了今后的工作方针。
    三年来，进藏部队在中央人民政府、人民革命军事委员会的正确领导，中国人民解放军西南军区、西北军区的直接指挥，各兄弟部队的协助，各地广大人民尤其是康藏地区藏族人民的大力支援和帮助，以及全体指挥员、战斗员的努力下，完成了进军西藏的历史任务，从而实现了祖国大陆的全部统一，正确地执行和宣传了毛主席、中央人民政府的民族平等团结、宗教信仰自由的政策和关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。在反对帝国主义爱祖国的号召下，进藏部队团结了广大的藏族人民，调解了藏族人民内部的大小纠纷，加强了藏族人民内部的团结。
    三年来，在进藏部队的帮助下，共开办了小学十四所，入学的儿童达一千三百多人；此外并训练了四百多名藏族干部，在拉萨和日喀则两地出版了藏文新闻简讯。各部医务工作人员在拉萨、日喀则、江孜、昌都、丁青等地设立了人民医院和门诊所，免费为藏族人民治病。
    各部队都严格尊重藏族人民的风俗习惯，并利用进军和生产修建的空隙，帮助驻地藏族人民进行收割、修建、清洁卫生等工作。这些行动，都受到藏族广大人民的热烈赞扬和拥护。
    部队在一面进军一面建设的口号下，修建了雅安到昌都段公路一千一百多公里，开垦了四万亩左右的荒地，减轻了人民负担，保证了部队供给的需要。这些成绩都为今后建设繁荣的新西藏和巩固祖国西陲国防线奠定了良好的基础。
    这次会议确定了今后工作方针和一九五三年大力进行民族工作、生产修建及加强部队文化学习、政策纪律教育等十项主要工作任务。会议指出，今后在工作中必须反对轻率急躁的作风和大民族主义思想的残余，更进一步调查研究西藏的实际情况，一切工作都应从西藏民族的政治、经济、文化、宗教等实际情况出发，严格尊重藏族人民的风俗习惯，继续巩固与扩大反帝爱国统一战线，加强团结藏族的广大人民，并大力培养藏族干部，有计划、有重点地逐步发展西藏民族的文化教育和卫生事业。
    到会代表一致通过了向毛主席表示长期建设西藏的决心书。
