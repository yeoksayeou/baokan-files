Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: American aggressors are increasingly blatantly clamoring to expand their war of aggression to China. The US Far East Air Force Commander Weyland and the Far East Navy Commander Briscoe have recently echoed each other in threatening that, as soon as Washington gives the order, they can immediately take action against mainland China.

According to the International News Service, Weyland declared in Tokyo on the 15th that he was "ready to bomb mainland China." He said that as soon as the order from Washington was received, the US Air Force would be able to "expand the air war to Manchuria," and if necessary, could "extend it to mainland China and bomb mainland China." Then Briscoe also declared in Tokyo on the 21st that, as soon as the order from higher authorities was received, the US Navy would be able to "use aircraft carrier planes to bomb Manchuria or the Chinese coast together with the Air Force," it could conduct amphibious landings in North Korea, and could "go anywhere in the Far East."

Weyland and Briscoe's bellicose clamoring shows that, with Eisenhower's coming to power, the American aggressors have been actively preparing steps to expand their military adventures in the Far East. However, as Weyland and Briscoe simultaneously had to admit, if the US Air Force and Navy want to expand the war to China, then they must add strength, needing more planes, destroyers, and aircraft carriers, and still "cannot expect to completely destroy the Chinese Air Force" nor completely blockade the Chinese coast. The "Washington Post" reported as early as January 6th that even some US Navy personnel believe that: "A blockade is neither wise nor simple." "Some people bluntly say that freeing up the ships necessary to carry out the blockade is a dangerous action, and some people simply doubt whether this task can be accomplished." If they dare to risk expanding the war of aggression, it is very clear that waiting for the arrogant American aggressors will be an even more tragic and thorough defeat.

### 美远东空军和海军司令  疯狂叫嚣扩大战争

    美远东空军和海军司令
    疯狂叫嚣扩大战争
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国侵略者越来越明目张胆地叫嚣要把侵略战争扩大到中国来。美国远东空军司令威兰和远东海军司令布里斯科，最近先后异口同声地威胁说，只要华盛顿命令一下，他们立刻可以对中国大陆采取行动。
    据国际新闻社报道，威兰十五日在东京宣称，他“已经准备轰炸中国大陆”。他说，只要接到华盛顿的命令，美国空军就能够“把空战扩大到满洲去”，如果有必要的话，并能“伸延到中国大陆和轰炸中国大陆”。接着布里斯科二十一日也在东京宣称，只要接到高级当局的命令，美国海军就能够“以航空母舰的飞机与空军共同轰炸满洲或中国沿海一带”，它可以在北朝鲜进行两栖登陆，并且能够“开往远东的任何地方去”。
    威兰和布里斯科发出这种好战叫嚣，说明随着艾森豪威尔的上台，美国侵略者已经积极准备在远东扩大军事冒险的步骤。但是，正如威兰和布里斯科同时不得不承认的，如果美国海空军要把战争扩大到中国来，那就必需增添力量，需要更多的飞机、驱逐舰和航空母舰，而且仍然“不能预期彻底摧毁中国空军”，也不能彻底封锁中国海岸。“华盛顿邮报”早在一月六日就报道说，连一部分美国海军人员也认为：“封锁行动既非明智，也不简单。”“有些人直率地说，腾出那些为进行封锁所必需的舰只，是一个危险的行动，有些人根本怀疑这个任务是否办得到。”如果他们敢于冒险扩大侵略战争，十分明显，等待着狂妄的美国侵略者的，将是更悲惨更彻底的失败。
