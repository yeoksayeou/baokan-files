    At the signing ceremony of the final protocol between China and the Soviet Union on the Soviet government transferring the Chinese Changchun Railway to the People's Republic of China, I express my heartfelt gratitude with boundless excitement to the Soviet government and people for their noble friendship and highly enthusiastic and selfless assistance to our government and people over the past three years. During these three years, all the Soviet comrades working on the Chinese Changchun Railway, headed by Comrades Yelogov, Grunichev, and Vasilyev, carried out fraternal and friendly cooperation with the Chinese workers. They unreservedly taught the Chinese employees the Soviet socialist principles of railway management and advanced experience, and adapted to the Chinese situation to create a set of effective and complete railway management methods. Over the past three years, the Chinese Changchun Railway has overfulfilled the transportation and financial tasks assigned by the state, basically completed the enterprise reform work, and achieved the predetermined goals, making the Chinese Changchun Railway a model banner for Chinese railways. These achievements are manifested in:
    (1) The Chinese Changchun Railway formulated and implemented production and financial plans from the beginning, and formulated and implemented technical organization measures plans; under the original equipment conditions, actively improved management and technical management; explored internal potential, increased capital accumulation, implemented economic accounting systems; signed collective contracts, carried out labor competitions, promoted advanced working methods, and rewarded inventions and promoted rationalization proposals. This series of complete measures enabled the old enterprise to quickly complete the reform work and establish a brand-new socialist enterprise management system, making the Chinese Changchun Railway highly efficient, low-cost, and highly profitable, setting an example for railways across the country to learn from.
    (2) The Chinese Changchun Railway has become a school for training new Chinese railway cadres. The Soviet expert comrades working on the Chinese Changchun Railway, with a high degree of internationalist spirit, patiently taught Chinese comrades, which not only rapidly improved the political awareness and technical skills of the 100,000 employees of the Chinese Changchun Railway, but also trained thousands of leading cadres from railways inside and outside the customs, which played an extremely important role in spreading Soviet advanced experience and improving Chinese railway work.
    (3) The Chinese Changchun Railway played a leading role in the growth of the new Chinese railways. The successful promotion of Soviet advanced experience on the Chinese Changchun Railway educated some technicians who worshipped Britain, the United States, Japan, and Germany with facts, broke their conservative ideas, and basically cleared the ideological obstacles on the road to learning from the Soviet Union. Many advanced experiences promoted by railways across the country come from the Chinese Changchun Railway. Many advanced workers' banners of the national railways are also cultivated from the Chinese Changchun Railway. These experiences and advanced workers are personally promoted and cultivated by Soviet experts. Therefore, the rapid growth of national railways is inseparable from the advanced role of the Chinese Changchun Railway.
    (4) The brilliant achievements of the Chinese Changchun Railway are the victorious crystallization of the friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and the merits and honors jointly created by the railway workers of the two countries. In the actual work of two years and eight months, the unbreakable friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union has been further consolidated, and it has closely united the people of the two countries.
    Due to the close and friendly cooperation between Chinese and Soviet workers, the work of the Chinese Changchun Railway has shown that: production technology indicators can be combined with economic and financial indicators, national interests can be combined with enterprise interests, production interests can be combined with mass interests, and leadership intentions can be combined with the creativity of the masses.
    The reason why the Chinese Changchun Railway can achieve brilliant achievements is due to the correctness of the policy of continuously developing and consolidating friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet governments; and due to the excellent qualities of the people educated under the socialist system of the Soviet comrades serving the Chinese Changchun Railway, and their sincere assistance to the Chinese railway cause. Soviet comrades, armed with the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, are proficient in technical skills, and implement Leninist and Stalinist leadership styles and methods in their work, demonstrating a high degree of principle and responsibility, and earnestly and gradually promoting various advanced technical working methods and scientific working systems of Soviet railway management in the Chinese Changchun Railway, and combined with the actual situation in China, cultivated and educated Chinese employees. Chinese railway employees also comprehended and promoted these advanced experiences and methods with a creative spirit, and conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "learn from the CPSU," and gave full play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their work.
    The achievements of the Chinese Changchun Railway in the past three years are the victory of the leadership of the Chinese and Soviet governments, and the victory of the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.
    From today onwards, the Chinese Changchun Railway Administration will be renamed the Harbin Railway Administration and will be managed by Chinese comrades themselves. However, the entire experience of the Chinese Changchun Railway has not yet been fully learned and implemented by the national railways in the past, and has not yet been systematically promoted in the national railway system. Therefore, consolidating the achievements of the Chinese Changchun Railway, summarizing its entire experience, cultivating a large number of talents, and effectively and comprehensively promoting the experience of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the national railways, and striving to improve all railways in the country to the existing level of the Chinese Changchun Railway in the next few years. This is a work of decisive significance for the national railways. Therefore, the general policy of the Harbin Railway Administration in 1953 is determined as: to make the greatest efforts to consolidate the existing achievements of the Chinese Changchun Railway, continue to summarize experience, train cadres, and on the basis of consolidating the existing foundation, steadily move forward and continue to improve to meet the arrival of the high tide of economic construction in our great motherland. Finally, we shout:
    Long live the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Stalin, the teacher of the working people of the world!

    在中苏关于苏联将中长路移交我国最后议定书签署仪式上
    中央铁道部部长滕代远的讲词
    在今天举行的中苏关于苏联政府将中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国最后议定书的签署仪式上，我以无限兴奋的心情，对三年来苏联政府和人民给我国政府和人民的崇高友谊以及高度热情的无私帮助，表示深切的感谢。在这三年间以叶洛果夫同志、格鲁尼切夫同志、华西里耶夫同志为首的，在中国长春铁路工作的全体苏联同志与中国职工进行了兄弟般的友谊合作。他们把苏联社会主义经营管理铁路的原则和先进经验，毫无保留地教导给中国员工，并适应中国的情况，创造出一套行之有效的完整的铁路经营管理方法。三年来，中国长春铁路超额完成了国家给予的运输任务和财务任务，基本上完成了企业改革工作，达成了预定的奋斗目标，使中国长春铁路成为中国铁路的模范旗帜。这些成就表现在：
    （一）中国长春铁路一开始就编制和贯彻实行了生产财务计划，制订和贯彻执行了技术组织措施计划；在原有的设备条件之下，积极地改进经营管理和技术管理；发掘内部潜在能力，增加资金积累，实行经济核算制；签订集体合同，开展劳动竞赛，推广先进工作方法，以及奖励创造发明和提倡合理化建议等。这一系列的完整措施，使旧的企业迅速地完成了改革工作，建立起一套崭新的社会主义企业管理制度，使中国长春铁路达到效率高、成本低、利润大，为全国铁路学习的榜样。
    （二）中国长春铁路成为培养新中国铁路干部的学校。在中国长春铁路工作的苏联专家同志，以高度的国际主义精神，循循善诱地教导中国同志，不仅使中国长春铁路十万员工在政治觉悟和技术业务水平上迅速获得提高，并且还训练了数千名来自关内外各铁路的领导干部，这对于传播苏联先进经验，改进中国铁路工作，起了极其重大的作用。
    （三）中国长春铁路对于新中国铁路的成长，起了带头作用。中国长春铁路推广苏联先进经验的成功，以事实教育了某些崇拜英、美、日、德的技术人员，打破了他们的保守思想，基本上廓清了学习苏联前进道路上的思想障碍。全国铁路所推行的许多先进经验都是来自中国长春铁路的。全国铁路的许多先进工作者旗帜，也都是从中国长春路培养出来的。这些经验和先进工作者，都是由苏联专家亲自推行和亲手培养出来的。因此，全国铁路的迅速成长与中国长春铁路的先进作用是分不开的。
    （四）中国长春铁路的光辉成就，是中苏两大民族之间友谊合作的胜利结晶，是两国铁路职工共同创造的功勋和荣誉，在两年又八个月的实际工作中，更加巩固了中苏两大民族牢不可破的友谊，它已把两国的人民紧紧地团结在一起了。
    由于中苏两国职工的亲密友好合作，使中国长春铁路的工作表现了：生产技术指标能够与经济财务指标相结合，国家利益能够与企业利益相结合，生产利益能够与群众利益相结合，领导意图能够与群众的创造性相结合。
    中国长春铁路所以能获得辉煌的成就，是由于中苏两国政府不断地发展与巩固友好合作政策的正确；由于服务于中国长春铁路的苏联同志们具有社会主义制度教育下的人民的优秀品质，对于中国铁路事业的真诚帮助。苏联同志，既有马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的革命理论武装了头脑，又对技术业务熟练，并且在工作中贯彻了列宁、斯大林式的领导作风与领导方法，表现了高度的原则性和负责精神，把苏联经营管理铁路的各种先进技术工作方法和科学的工作制度，认真地逐步推行在中国长春铁路上，并结合了中国的实际情况，培养教育了中国员工。中国铁路员工也以创造性的精神，领会并推行了这些先进的经验和方法，并认真地执行了毛主席“向联共学习”的指示，在工作中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。
    中国长春铁路三年来的这些成就，是中苏两国政府领导的胜利，是中苏两国人民友好合作的胜利。
    从今天起中国长春铁路管理局改为哈尔滨铁路管理局，由中国同志自己负责经营了。但中国长春铁路的全部经验，过去还没有为全国铁路全部学会和贯通，还没有在全国铁路系统地推行。因此巩固中国长春铁路的成果，总结其全部经验，培养大批人材，并把中国长春铁路的一套经验，向全国铁路有效地全面推广，求得在今后几年内，把全国所有铁路提高到中国长春铁路现有的水平。这对全国铁路是一件具有决定意义的工作。因此，确定哈尔滨铁路管理局在一九五三年的总方针是：以最大的努力巩固中国长春铁路已有的成果，继续总结经验，培养干部，在巩固已有基础上，稳步前进，继续提高以迎接我们伟大祖国的经济建设高潮的到来。最后我们高呼：
    中苏两国人民的友谊团结万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的导师斯大林万岁！
