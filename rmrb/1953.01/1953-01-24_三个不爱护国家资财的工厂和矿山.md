Three Factories and Mines That Do Not Cherish State Property

In the Southwest region, some industrial and mining enterprises exhibit a serious lack of care for state property.

The 103 Factory is responsible for safeguarding valuable industrial and mining equipment worth hundreds of billions [of yuan] for the state. As early as June of last year, the Southwest Materials Administration allocated all maintenance funds to the factory based on the maintenance budget prepared by the factory. However, after receiving these funds, the factory only used a small portion to purchase some maintenance materials, emphasizing objective difficulties, and delaying maintenance work. To this day, this valuable equipment is still placed in leaky, damp warehouses, where it is left to rust and corrode. If this situation is not changed immediately, it will cause the state to lose tens of billions [of yuan] annually.

The 401 Coal Mine is storing a batch of state treasury materials in an open-air yard without maintenance. In August of last year, the Southwest Materials Administration allocated maintenance funds to the mine, but the mine has not yet begun maintenance work. They plan to wait until the mine's own basic construction materials are used up, and then free up an old bamboo shed to store this batch of state treasury materials. They even plan to evaluate the price of this bamboo shed and report it to the Southwest Materials Administration for reimbursement.

The above-mentioned situations are not limited to just these one or two units. Therefore, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee issued a circular to all localities and relevant departments, requiring them to strictly inspect and correct the above errors.

Furthermore, the Raw Materials Section of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant lacks an overall perspective and disregards the long-term interests of the state. They deliberately smashed the boiler hearth of the factory's temporarily unused boilers and the grate bar plates of the No. 4 Power Plant of the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau, turning valuable boiler equipment (all of which was imported) worth hundreds of millions [of yuan] into a pile of scrap iron. Workers Liang Xuitang and Cui Qinghuai from the No. 4 Power Plant tried to dissuade them when they discovered them smashing the equipment, but they ignored them. Liang Xuitang and others negotiated with Zhang Wenhuan, the head of the Power Section of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, but Zhang Wenhuan actually said: "This equipment is indeed very important, but we don't need it now." The leading cadres of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant should quickly and earnestly investigate and deal with this extremely wrong behavior.

Editor's Note: The situation of the Southwest 103 Factory, the 401 Coal Mine, and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's lack of care for state property is very serious. It is not enough for the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee to simply issue a circular requiring all localities and relevant departments to inspect and correct this phenomenon. The problems that have already occurred at the 103 Factory and the 401 Coal Mine must be effectively dealt with. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China should also earnestly investigate and deal with the incident of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant smashing important boiler equipment.

    三个不爱护国家资财的工厂和矿山
    西南地区部分工矿企业存在着严重的不爱护国家资财的现象。
    一零三厂替国家保管着价值数百亿元的贵重工矿设备。早在去年六月间，西南物资管理局即根据该厂编制的维护预算，将全部维护费拨给该厂。但该厂收到这笔款项以后，仅以很少一部分购买了一些维护材料，并强调客观困难，迟迟不兴工维护，至今仍把这套贵重的设备放置在漏雨、潮湿的库房内，任其生锈腐蚀。此种情况如不立即改变，每年将使国家损失数十亿元。
    四零一煤矿将代管的一批国库物资放置在露天坝中，不加维护。去年八月间，西南物资管理局即拨给该矿维护费，但该矿至今仍未开始进行维护工作，打算等待该矿自存的部分基本建设材料用完以后，腾出一座旧篾棚放置这批国库物资，甚至还打算将这座篾棚估价后向西南物资管理局报销。
    存在类似情况的，还不止上述一二单位。为此，西南财政经济委员会通报各地各有关部门，要求严格检查纠正上述错误。
    又讯：太原钢铁厂原料股缺乏整体观念，不顾国家长远利益，将该厂暂时不用的锅炉火床和太原电业局第四发电厂锅炉备用品炉条板故意砸烂，使价值数亿元的锅炉重要器材（都是进口货）变成一堆废铁。第四发电厂工人梁秀堂、崔清怀等发现他们砸这些器材时，曾进行劝阻，他们竟置之不理。梁秀堂等向太原钢铁厂动力科负责人章文焕交涉，章文焕竟说：“这些器材倒是很重要，就是现在我们用不着。”这种极端错误的行为，太原钢铁厂领导干部应赶快认真检查处理。
    编者按：西南一零三厂、四零一煤矿和太原钢铁厂不爱护国家资材的情况是十分严重的。西南财政经济委员会仅仅发出通报，要求各地各有关部门检查纠正这种现象是不够的，对一零三厂和四零一煤矿已经发生的问题必须切实处理。中共太原市委亦应切实检查处理太原钢铁厂砸坏锅炉重要器材的事件。
