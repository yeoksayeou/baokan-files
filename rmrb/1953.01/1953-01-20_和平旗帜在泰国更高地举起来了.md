    The Banner of Peace is Raised Higher in Thailand
    In the early morning of November 10, 1952, approximately one hundred democrats were arrested by the Phibun reactionary authorities, including some active peace fighters and progressive journalists. Among them were Dr. Nai Charoon Suksathit, Chairman of the Thailand Peace Committee, several Vice-Chairmen and members of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, several members of the Student Committee of Thammasat University, editors of well-known newspapers, and many patriotic overseas Chinese, who had fought unyieldingly for peace and freedom of the press. They were charged with violating Articles 104 to 111 of the Penal Code, namely, endangering Thailand's internal and external security and attempting to overthrow the government by force and place Thailand in the hands of a foreign country.

    The residences of those arrested and the offices of the newspapers were searched. A large pile of letters, manuscripts ready for printing, books, medicines, legal radio receivers, and many other items were confiscated; however, none of these items were illegal or related to the alleged crimes.

    While persecuting peace-loving democrats and patriotic overseas Chinese, the Thai reactionary authorities also purposefully arrested some bourgeois elements who advocated launching a coup d'état (they called themselves "National Liberation Movement" members) and confiscated some of their documents. The police deliberately confused the two—peace advocates and coup plotters. The Thai government called these peace and freedom-loving people "terrorists." Nai Pao Sriyanond, the head of the Thai police, shamelessly slandered the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the National Assembly, clamoring that, according to the confiscated documents, the Soviet government and the Chinese government would actively help to overthrow the current government. He then declared that the Thai government was prepared to intensify its "anti-communism" and would therefore continue to make arrests.

    To understand the background of this large-scale arrest in Thailand, it is necessary to review the situation in Thailand before the arrest. Because the Thai government implemented a policy of acting as an accomplice to American aggression, the entire country suffered greatly. Young people were sent batch after batch to the Korean battlefield, far from their homes, to die for the interests of Wall Street war profiteers. Domestically, every ordinary family lived in poverty. The entire northeast of Thailand became a famine area, yet the Thai government refused to provide relief and denied this fact. Vast areas in the northwest suffered floods due to heavy rains and rising river waters; however, the Thai government said: "Floods are better than lack of rain." Due to the implementation of the American "embargo" policy, rubber merchants in the south were driven to bankruptcy. In the cities, workers suffered oppression and severe exploitation. In the countryside, farmers' land was plundered by various means. The Thai government supported exploiters and oppressors in the cities and the countryside. Taxes increased rapidly and heavily. All this was intolerable. The people had to stand up and fight and help each other. The Thailand Peace Committee was established, and the people demanded an end to war and war policies, the abolition of the "embargo," and the establishment of free international trade. The Thailand Peace Committee also established the Northeast Relief Committee. The people widely supported the Relief Committee. The relief work in the first two weeks was successfully completed, and the relief committee members returned to Bangkok on November 9th. But the next day, when they woke up, the police came with arrest warrants to arrest them.

    Shortly before this, the Thai Press Association had opposed the Thai government's censorship system, pointing out that it violated human rights and the constitution, and the Press Association demanded the abolition of censorship regulations. The Committee for the Defense of Freedom of the Press was established under the leadership of Nai Kulab Saipradit. The committee issued an appeal to the people, asking everyone to support the demands of the Press Association; hundreds of thousands of people signed the appeal. This frightened the Thai government.

    In the cities, the workers' demands were victorious; in the countryside, the farmers actively engaged in the struggle against deception and exploitation; although the government was helping the landlords, the farmers also achieved many victories.

    Students joined the Thailand Peace Committee and bravely fought for the right to education. The strength of students and young people was growing day by day. The reactionary ruling clique watched this development with great anxiety.

    With the help of the Phibun government, which sold out national interests, Thailand was being colonized by American imperialism. It is no secret that the Thai government, under the direction of American imperialism, is implementing a policy of preparing for war. The Thai people oppose the policies that bring death and disaster to their homeland.

    The situation has never been so serious.

    On October 27th, the United States and the Philippines held a military conference and decided on the so-called "common defense policy" regarding Vietnam, Malaya, and Thailand, and prepared to use military force in Korea and Vietnam.

    On October 31st, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Foster "visited" Thailand and suggested that the Thai government join the so-called "Asian Foreign Aid Cooperation Agency" with Malaya and Vietnam.

    On November 2nd, Admiral Radford, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and his staff arrived in Thailand and convened a meeting with the Thai General Staff to discuss the military situation in Southeast Asia.

    Nai Pao Sriyanond, the head of the Thai police, told members of the National Assembly that before the arrests, he had indeed received "advice" from Britain and the United States. The content of the advice was to "urgently suppress communism"; and his "communism" also referred to the peace movement. On November 13th, the third day after the arrests began, the Thai reactionary government submitted the "Law on Preventing Communist Activities" to the National Assembly. On the same day, the National Assembly passed this anti-democratic bill, and the King of Thailand signed it immediately. The next day, the bill came into effect. A police chief declared that signing the peace appeal and the appeal of the Press Association was a "criminal act," that is to say, whoever signed was a "communist." Civil servants, university students, trade unions, clubs, or members of any organization, if deemed "left-leaning," would be interrogated. Poor people could not mention their poverty, otherwise they would be regarded as "communists," because the Thai government's statement said: "Thailand has no poverty, it is a highly prosperous country."

    But the fascist suppression of the Phibun government did not thwart the Thai people's struggle for peace and democratic rights, but on the contrary, intensified this struggle. The day after the large-scale arrest began, immediately after the Thai government announced the so-called crimes of the arrested members of the Peace Committee and other peace fighters, the Thailand Peace Committee issued a statement protesting the persecution by the Thai government and demanding the immediate release of the arrested peace fighters. The statement emphasized that the Thailand Peace Committee was supported by the broad masses of the people. The people would certainly not support the attempt of the Phibun clique to confuse these peace fighters with those coup plotters. This move could only further discredit the Phibun government itself. The statement called on all peace fighters across the country: "Bravely continue to promote the advocacy of peace, and defend it to the end!"

    Alarmed, the Thai reactionary authorities hurriedly confiscated the "Thai Voice Newspaper," which published this statement. Their attempt to cover the eyes of the people failed. The declaration had already spread among the people, and the broad masses of the people had widely read and studied this declaration. Peace-loving people supported peace fighters, and they demanded the release of those arrested. They helped take care of the families of those arrested and visited those arrested in prison to express their sympathy. The people bravely declared: "We are on the side of those arrested; we will continue to and raise the banner of peace even higher!"

    The peace fighters who fell into the hands of the fascist bandits firmly upheld the principles of peace and democracy. On November 18th, when he was summoned to court for questioning, Nai Lei Wangnaxi, the acting editor-in-chief of the "Thai Voice Newspaper," who was ill, said sternly:

    "I have no weapons or power (Note: The prosecutor told the judge that he had these), except for my pen. I have fought openly, for peace and resolutely against war. There are no secret operations. My highest wish is the freedom of mankind." He shouted in court: "Long live the peace fighters! Long live the struggle for freedom of the the press!"

    Nai Charoon Suksathit, Chairman of the Thailand Peace Committee, said to the judge: "Among those arrested are a group of people who promote peace, seek ways to prevent war, and effectively provide relief to the disaster areas in the northeast. These people are peace-loving journalists and students. Their work is entirely in line with the demands of the people, and serves the peace and happiness of the country and the people, not only for the Thai people, but also for the people of the whole world. This is a fact known to everyone." Referring to the slander of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference by the Thai reactionary authorities, he said: "The Beijing Peace Conference is for stopping the war, which is the wish of the people of the whole world!"

    Nai Marut Bunna, Chairman of the Student Union of Thammasat University, said in court: I was arrested because I held a position in the Student Union. I carried out my duties to protect the rights and interests of students, which has nothing to do with treason.

    Student Nai Cham Chiao Chuosuk said: "No one is behind us. If there is a background, it is only the resolution of the majority of students."

    The words of those arrested went deep into the hearts of sympathizers and began to spread widely. The strong fighting spirit of the peace fighters in shackles not only exposed the mask of the fascist oppressors, but also pointed out that the god of war is also stepping into the land beloved by the Thai people. No matter how the fascists threaten, they cannot stop the Thai people from continuing the struggle to save peace. The banner of peace is raised higher in Thailand. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 和平旗帜在泰国更高地举起来了

    和平旗帜在泰国更高地举起来了
    一九五二年十一月十日凌晨，约有一百名民主人士被銮披汶反动当局所逮捕，其中有一部分是积极的和平战士和进步记者，包括泰国和平委员会主席乃乍仑·速盛博士、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会的几位副主席和委员、法政大学学生委员会的几位委员、著名报馆编辑和许多爱国华侨，他们曾不屈不挠地为了争取和平与新闻自由而斗争。他们被控触犯刑法第一百零四条到第一百十一条，即所谓危害泰国内部和外部安全和试图以武力推翻政府并让泰国落入外国手中。
    被捕的人的住所和报馆办事处都遭到了搜查。一大堆信件、要付印的原稿、书籍、药品、合法的无线电收音机和许多别的东西，都被没收；但是这些东西中没有一样是非法的或者和所控告的罪名有关系的。
    在和迫害和平民主人士和爱国华侨同时，泰国反动当局又别有用心地逮捕了一些主张发动政变的资产阶级分子（他们自称是“民族解放运动”者），并且没收了他们的一些文件。警察故意把这两者——和平拥护者和发动政变者——混淆在一起。泰国政府把这些爱好和平与自由的人士叫做“恐怖分子”。泰国警察头子乃炮·是耶暖无耻地在国会中诬蔑苏联和中华人民共和国，叫嚣说：根据被没收的文件，苏联政府和中国政府将积极帮助推翻现政府。他接着宣称：泰国政府准备加紧“反共”，因此还要继续进行逮捕。
    为了了解这次泰国大逮捕的背景，回顾一下大逮捕以前的泰国情况是有必要的。由于泰国政府执行了充当美国侵略帮凶的政策，全国到处都受到了重大的苦难。青年人一批又一批地被送到远离家乡的朝鲜战场去为华尔街战争贩子的利益送命。在国内，每一家普通人家都过着贫困的生活。泰国的整个东北部变成一片饥馑地区，然而泰国政府不予救济，并且否认这一事实。西北部广大地区由于大雨和河水猛涨，发生水灾；然而泰国政府说：“洪水比缺雨还好些。”由于实行美国的“禁运”政策，南部的橡胶商人沦于破产。在城市里，工人们受着压迫和严重的剥削。在乡村，农民的土地被用各种办法掠夺去了。泰国政府支持城市里和乡村里的剥削者和压迫者。税额增加得很快而且很重。这一切都令人不能忍受。人民只得站起来斗争，并互相帮助。泰国和平委员会成立了，人民要求停止战争和战争政策，要求取消“禁运”，建立自由的国际贸易。泰国和平委员会还成立了东北赈济委员会。人民广泛地支持赈济委员会。头两个星期的赈济工作顺利地结束，赈济委员们在十一月九日回到了曼谷。但在第二天，当他们醒来时，警察就带着拘票来逮捕他们了。
    在此以前不久，泰国报界公会曾反对泰国政府的新闻检查制度，指出那是违犯人权和宪法的，报界公会要求取销新闻检查条例。维护新闻自由委员会在乃古腊·柿巴立领导下成立了。该委员会向人民发出了一项呼吁书，要求大家支持报界公会的要求；有数十万人在呼吁书上签了名。这使泰国政府害怕起来。
    在城市里，工人们的要求获得了胜利；在乡村，农民积极地从事反对欺骗和剥削的斗争；虽然政府在帮助地主，但农民们也获得了许多胜利。
    学生们参加了泰国和平委员会，勇敢地为受教育的权利而斗争。学生和青年的力量正在一天天增长。反动统治集团十分惶恐地注视着这种发展。
    美帝国主义得到出卖国家利益的銮披汶政府的帮助，使泰国殖民地化了。泰国政府在美帝国主义指使之下执行准备战争的政策，已不是秘密。泰国人民反对给他们的家园带来死亡和灾难的政策。
    形势从来没有这样严重过。
    十月二十七日，美菲举行军事会议，决定了关于越南、马来亚和泰国的所谓“共同防御政策”，并准备在朝鲜和越南使用兵力。
    十月三十一日，美国国防部副部长威廉·弗斯特“访问”泰国，建议泰国政府与马来亚和越南参加所谓“亚洲外援合作署”。
    十一月二日，美国太平洋舰队司令雷德弗和他的幕僚到了泰国，召集泰国的参谋总部人员开会，讨论东南亚地区的军事形势。
    泰国警察头子乃炮·是耶暖告诉国会议员说：在逮捕之前，他确实受到了英国和美国的“劝告”。劝告的内容是“紧急地镇压共产主义”；而他的“共产主义”也指和平运动。在十一月十三日，逮捕开始后的第三天，泰国反动政府将“防止共产主义活动法案”提交国会。就在当天，国会通过了这一项反民主的法案，泰国国王立即签署。第二天，法案开始实施。一个警察头子宣称，在和平呼吁书和在报界公会的呼吁书上签名是“犯罪行为”，那就是说，谁签名谁就是“共产党员”。公务员、大学生、工会、俱乐部或任何团体的会员，如果被认为是“左倾”的，就将被盘查。贫穷的人不能提到他的贫穷，否则他将被当作“共产党员”，因为泰国政府的声明说过：“泰国没有贫穷，它是高度繁荣的国家。”
    但是銮披汶政府的法西斯镇压并没有挫败泰国人民争取和平和民主权利的斗争，却相反地使这个斗争更为高涨。在大逮捕开始的第二天，紧接着泰国政府宣布被捕的和平委员会委员和其他和平战士的所谓罪状之后，泰国和平委员会发表了一个声明，抗议泰国政府的迫害，并要求立即释放被捕的和平战士。声明强调指出：泰国和平委员会是广大人民所拥护的。銮披汶集团把这些和平战士与那些政变分子混淆起来的图谋人民是一定不会支持的。这种举动只能更加败坏銮披汶政府自己而已。声明号召全国一切和平战士：“勇敢地继续推行和平的主张，并保卫它到底！”
    感到惊慌的泰国反动当局，慌忙地没收刊载了这一声明的“泰声报”。他们遮掩人民眼睛的企图失败了。宣言已经在人民中间传播开来，广大人民已广泛地阅读和研究这一宣言了。爱好和平的群众支援和平战士，他们要求释放被捕的人。他们帮助照顾被捕者的家属，并到狱中慰问被捕者。人民勇敢地宣告：“我们是在被捕者这一面的；我们将继续而且更高地举起和平的旗帜！”
    落在法西斯匪徒手中的和平战士坚定地拥护和平民主的原则。十一月十八日，当被传到法庭上受讯问的时候，在病中的“泰声报”代理总编辑乃雷·汪那西昂然地说：
    “我没有武器和势力（按：检查官对法官说他有这些），除了我的笔。我曾经公开地斗争，为和平和坚决反对战争而斗争。没有秘密行动。我的最高的愿望是人类的自由”。他在法庭上高呼：“和平战士们万岁！争取新闻自由的斗争万岁！”
    泰国和平委员会主席乃乍仑·速盛对法官说：“在被捕的人中有一群提倡和平、寻求防止战争的途径、并切实救济东北部灾荒的人。这些人是爱好和平的记者和学生。他们的工作全是符合人民的要求的，是为国家和人民的和平、幸福而服务的，不只为了泰国人民，而且为了全世界人民。这是大家都知道的事实”。在提到泰国反动当局对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的诽谤时，他说：“北京和平会议为的是停止战争，这是全世界人民的愿望！”
    法政大学学生会主席乃玛律·汶纳在法庭上说：我因为在学生会任职被捕，我按照自己的职责进行保护学生权益的工作，这是和叛国无关的。
    学生乃参·缴初柿说：“没有人作我们的后台，如果有后台的话，那就只有是大多数学生的决议。”
    被捕者的话深入了同情者的心中，并开始广泛地传播开来。被加上镣铐的和平战士的坚强战斗精神，不独揭开了法西斯压迫者的面幕，并且指出：战魔也正在踏进泰国人民所热爱的土地。不管法西斯分子怎样进行威胁，也不能阻止泰国人民继续进行拯救和平的斗争。和平旗帜在泰国更高地举起来了。　（新华社）
