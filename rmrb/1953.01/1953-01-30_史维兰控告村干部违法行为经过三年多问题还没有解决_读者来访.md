    Shi Weilan Accuses Village Cadres of Illegal Acts, Problem Unresolved After More Than Three Years
    ——Reader Visit
    On December 3rd of last year, reader Shi Weilan (female) visited the reader's letter group of this newspaper, accusing Li Youhui, a village cadre of Huocun Village in the Second District of former Wanping County, of consistently humiliating women. She also exposed the serious bureaucratic style of Tan Guipu, the former chief of the Justice Section of Wanping County, and other county and district leading cadres, as well as the president of the Jingxi Mining Area People's Court, in handling this issue. The following is a summary of Shi Weilan's conversation:
    My name is Shi Weilan, I am 28 years old, and I live in Huocun Village (formerly the Second District of Wanping County) in the Jingxi Mining Area of Beijing. My husband has been serving in the Chinese People's Liberation Army for six years. There are elderly parents-in-law and two children at home. Li Youhui, the former public security officer of our village, had a bad style and often molested and insulted women. In the summer of 1949, he molested me many times and even wanted to rape me. In order to accuse him of this crime, I went to the Second District Government of the former Wanping County several times, the People's Government of the former Wanping County and the People's Government of the Jingxi Mining Area seven times, and the Beijing People's Court three times. After more than three years, I sold countless grains and an ox to raise travel expenses. What I encountered was shirking responsibility and threats. No agency seriously and responsibly handled my problem. Therefore, I want to report this situation to the People's Daily, hoping you can assist me in getting this issue resolved reasonably.
    The story is like this: In June 1949 (lunar calendar), one day I went to the field to pull vegetables, Li Youhui stopped me and said a lot of dirty and nasty things, and forcibly held me and entangled me for a long time. From then on, he did this every time he saw me; I was so upset that I didn't dare to go to the field to work anymore. On July 28th, Li Youhui broke into my house when my parents-in-law were in the field and wanted to rape me. I struggled desperately and shouted loudly; my children were also frightened and cried. Only then did he let me go. At that time, District Chief Zhao of the former Wanping County Second District was working in our village. I appealed to District Chief Zhao, asking him to deal with this matter. He didn't ask anything, but took both me and Li Youhui to the district government. After a while, they told me to go home and wait for news. But a few days later, Li Youhui returned to the village and continued to be a cadre. I went to the district to inquire, and they still told me to go home and wait. My father-in-law was so angry that he went to Baoding to find my husband to discuss this matter. I went to the county judicial section to accuse him. Who knew that Tan Guipu, the chief of the judicial section, was a cousin of Li Youhui. Without asking the circumstances, he wanted me to say who sent me to sue, otherwise I was a spy. I was so scared that I went home; but the more I thought about it, the more unconvinced I became, and I went to the county judicial section to accuse him again. This time Tan Guipu said, "You are not a spy, go home!" and said that Li Youhui "anyway, he doesn't deserve the death penalty." In August, I went to the county judicial section to inquire again, and they wrote a letter asking me to go to the district to resolve it. The district chief said after seeing the letter: "The material is not enough, go back!" I went to An County Chief of the former Wanping County, and he said: "We have investigated, you were a good girl at home, and a good daughter-in-law after marriage. Go home and live your life!" He didn't mention a word about how to deal with Li Youhui. Because of this matter, my husband came home once, but it was useless.
    Thus, Li Youhui became even bolder. After my incident, Li Youhui also ran to Li Wantian's house to molest Li Wantian's wife, scaring her to run away and not dare to go home. The villagers were very angry about Li Youhui's illegal behavior, but no one dared to speak out.
    My problem has not been resolved, and my parents-in-law often quarrel and get angry with me. I feel very aggrieved and painful. I committed suicide by eating red alum last October; later I was rescued by Li Shanyun. The "Zhang Shunyou incident" gave me great encouragement. In September and October of this year (1952), I went to the Beijing People's Court three times to appeal, but they still didn't resolve my problem. Once, a comrade in the reception room of the court wouldn't even let me in. Finally, they let me go to the Jingxi Mining Area People's Court to resolve it. On November 27th, I went to the Jingxi Mining Area People's Court to inquire. The president of the court said impatiently: "How much manpower has been wasted for your matter! Li Youhui is just joking with you." I went to the Jingxi Mining Area Women's Federation, but they didn't care either; a comrade even said to me: "Don't run around, others will treat you as a spy!" I really didn't expect these cadres to say such things.
    Recently, the village carried out party rectification, and found that Li Youhui had embezzled money for preferential treatment of military families, and then decided not to let him be a village cadre. But Li Youhui's bad behavior of consistently insulting women has not been dealt with. I think it is wrong for the above-mentioned agencies to be irresponsible in this matter. I hope they will change this wrong attitude and seriously deal with Li Youhui's problem of insulting women.
    Editor's note: The situation described by Shi Weilan reflects the serious bureaucratic style of leading cadres like the Wanping County magistrate, who turn a blind eye to the illegal and undisciplined behavior of lower-level cadres. This wrong style has greatly fueled the illegal and undisciplined behavior of lawless cadres, creating extremely bad political influence, which must be corrected immediately.
    The problem of lawless element Li Youhui consistently insulting women and acting recklessly is serious. However, the relevant leaders of the former Wanping County and the cadres of the Jingxi Mining Area People's Court knew about this situation, but did not take it seriously and did not deal with it. They condoned and shielded illegal cadres, and some even described illegal and undisciplined behavior as "joking"; but they regarded the masses' just accusations as trouble, "wasting manpower," and even threatened them with the label of "spy." In this way, Shi Weilan's just accusations have not received the due support of the People's Government for a long time, taking more than three years and wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. And the lawless cadre Li Youhui is still unscrupulously insulting women and oppressing the masses in the village.
    We suggest that the Beijing Municipal People's Government should attach importance to Shi Weilan's accusation, urge the Jingxi Mining Area People's Government to severely deal with this incident, and order the relevant cadres to thoroughly correct the above-mentioned bureaucratic style.

### 史维兰控告村干部违法行为经过三年多问题还没有解决——读者来访

    史维兰控告村干部违法行为经过三年多问题还没有解决
    ——读者来访
    去年十二月三日，读者史维兰（女）访问本报读者来信组，控诉前宛平县第二区火村村干部李有会一贯污辱妇女的恶劣行为，并揭发前宛平县司法科科长谭桂圃等县、区领导干部及京西矿区人民法院院长等处理这个问题时的严重官僚主义作风。现将史维兰的谈话摘要发表于后：
    我叫史维兰，今年二十八岁，家住北京市京西矿区火村（原宛平县二区）。我丈夫参加中国人民解放军已有六年了，家里有年老的公婆和两个孩子。我村前任公安员李有会作风恶劣，经常调戏和污辱妇女。一九四九年夏，他多次调戏我，并且还要奸污我。为了控告他这种罪恶行为，我曾数次到前宛平县第二区政府，七次到前宛平县人民政府和京西矿区人民政府，三次到北京市人民法院，经过三年多，因凑路费而卖了无数粮食和一头牛；遇到的却是推诿和威胁，没有一处机关认真负责地处理我的问题。因此，我要向人民日报反映这个情况，希望你们协助我，使这个问题得到合理解决。
    事情的经过是这样：一九四九年阴历六月，一天我到地里拔菜，李有会拦住我说了很多下流难听的坏话，硬拉住我纠缠了很久。从此以后，他见了我就这样；闹得我再也不敢下地干活了。七月二十八日这天，李有会乘我公婆下地时，闯进我家要强奸我。我拚命挣扎，大声喊叫；我的小孩子也吓得大哭大闹。他这才放松我。当时原宛平县第二区赵区长正在我村工作。我就向赵区长申诉，要求他处理这件事。他什么也没有问，就把我和李有会都带到区政府去。不多会，他们就让我回家听信。可是几天以后，李有会就回村了，照常当干部。我到区里催问，他们仍旧叫我回家等。我公公气得到保定找我丈夫去商量这事。我就到县司法科控诉。谁知道司法科科长谭桂圃和李有会是表兄弟，他不问情由，就要我说出是谁支使来上告的，不然就是特务。我当时吓得回家了；但后来越想越不服气，又去县司法科控告。这次谭桂圃说：“你不是特务，回家吧！”并说李有会“反正该不上枪毙的罪”。八月里，我又到县司法科催问，他们写信叫我到区里去解决。区长见信后说：“材料不够，回去吧！”我找原宛平县安县长，他说：“我们调查了，你在家是好姑娘，结婚后是好媳妇。回家过日子吧！”对于怎样处理李有会一字未提。为了这件事，我丈夫曾回家一次，但也没有用。
    这样，李有会就愈发大胆了。在我这件事发生以后，李有会还跑到李万田家里调戏李万田的媳妇，吓的人家跑出去不敢回家。村里群众对李有会的不法行为都很气愤，但谁也不敢说。
    我的问题没有得到解决，公婆常和我吵嘴闹气。我感到非常委屈和痛苦，在去年十月曾吃红矾自杀；后来被李山云救活了。“张顺有事件”给了我很大的鼓舞，今年（一九五二年）九、十月，我又三次到北京市人民法院上告，但他们还是不解决我这个问题。有一次，该院收发室的同志还不让我进。最后又让我到京西矿区人民法院去解决。十一月二十七日，我到京西矿区人民法院询问，该院院长很不耐烦地说：“为你这件事浪费了多少人力呀！李有会是和你开玩笑。”我去找京西矿区妇联，她们也不管；有一位同志竟还对我说：“不要到处乱跑，别人会拿你当特务！”我真想不到这些干部会说出这样的话来。
    最近，村里进行整党，查出李有会贪污了优待军属的钱，才决定不让他当村干部了。但李有会一贯污辱妇女的恶劣行为却仍旧没有受到处理。我认为上面提到的这些机关对这件事不负责任是不对的，希望他们改变这种错误态度，认真处理李有会污辱妇女的问题。
    编者按：史维兰所谈的情况，反映了像宛平县县长这些领导干部对下级干部的违法乱纪行为熟视无睹的严重官僚主义作风。这种错误作风，已经大大助长了不法干部的违法乱纪行为，造成极其恶劣的政治影响，必须立刻纠正。
    不法分子李有会一贯侮辱妇女，胡作非为，问题是严重的。但是，史维兰所指的原宛平县这几个县区领导干部以及京西矿区人民法院的干部知道了这个情况，却毫不感严重，不予处理。他们对违法干部纵容包庇，有的甚至还把违法乱纪的行为说成是“开玩笑”；对群众的正义控告，却看作是找麻烦，是“浪费人力”，甚至还以“特务”的帽子来威胁。就这样，史维兰的正义控诉长期不能得到人民政府应有的支持，费时三年多，浪费了很大的人力、物力。而不法干部李有会仍旧无法无天地在村中侮辱妇女、压迫群众。
    我们建议北京市人民政府应重视史维兰的控诉，督促京西矿区人民政府严正处理这一事件，并责成各有关干部彻底纠正上述官僚主义作风。
