During the New Year and Spring Festival period of 1953, local people's governments should lead the local people in carrying out activities to support the People's Army and give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers and to revolutionary disabled soldiers; at the same time, all personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should carry out activities to support the people's government and cherish the people. Under the slogan of "the army loves the people, the people support the army," further enhance awareness, strengthen unity, consolidate national defense, carry out large-scale economic construction, and shatter the aggressive conspiracies of the American imperialists.

I. It is necessary to deeply publicize among local staff and the masses the fine qualities and heroic deeds of the People's Army. For example, the People's Army's heroic killing of enemies, defending the frontier, participating in construction, learning culture, loving the motherland, loving the people, and so on. It should also be explained that the reason why the People's Army has such excellent qualities is because they are the sons and daughters of the people, have the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and are cultivated and educated by Chairman Mao. In order to carry out this education vividly and concretely, combat heroes and learning models from the army and the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea can be invited to give reports or organize seminars, using their personal experiences and what they have seen and heard to illustrate that the People's Army is indeed the most beloved people, in order to strengthen the concept of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers.

II. It is necessary to deeply publicize the great achievements of our motherland's construction over the past three years, and explain that this is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the people's governments at all levels, and the achievements created by the hard work of the broad masses of the people. In order to carry out this education vividly and concretely, local party and government cadres, models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers, and labor models can be invited to give reports or organize seminars in the troops to strengthen the concept of supporting the government and cherishing the people.

III. A thorough inspection of the work of giving preferential treatment should be carried out, with whether the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers are guaranteed and whether they have been improved as the main criteria for inspection. The specific methods are: check the harvest volume of substitute farming and production, evaluate preferential treatment models, propose methods for rectifying substitute farming and further organizing the production of families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, so that substitute farming is combined with mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, and adjust the burden of substitute farming, in order to ensure a definite guarantee of output. In areas where the evaluation of preferential treatment models has been completed, the focus should be on planning substitute farming and organizing the production of families of martyrs and soldiers. At the same time, the use of preferential treatment funds should be checked to see whether the distribution is appropriate and timely. Cities should conduct an inspection of the production and employment of families of martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers, and promptly solve any problems found, so that their production and employment are properly arranged. Problems related to army-people relations should also be checked, especially the handling of letters from the troops to local governments (including letters from the people), which should be included as part of the inspection by government agencies.

IV. A major inspection of mass discipline should be carried out in the army, using the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of our army as the standard. The specific methods are: hold forums with local residents, humbly solicit the opinions of the masses, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and inspect and expose various phenomena that violate mass discipline; personnel of troops and military organs stationed in cities should especially check the situation regarding compliance with public order. Troops stationed in ethnic minority areas should deeply study ethnic minority policies and check for any violations of policies and customs of ethnic minorities. All troops should attach great importance to letters and requests or criticisms from the people, handle them seriously and promptly, and must not ignore them. This item should also be included as part of the inspection.

V. Carry out army-people mutual assistance and army-people get-togethers. For example, the local government should organize the masses to help the troops solve difficulties, organize labor models to guide the troops in production technology, and organize people who are familiar with local conditions to explain the local situation to the troops. The troops should send people to help with the training of local militia and the cultural learning movement of the masses, such as inviting them to visit the life of the troops, participate in military, political, cultural, and sports activities, giving them some books and cultural and recreational equipment, explaining military knowledge to them, and publicizing the stories of combat heroes. Also organize army-people get-togethers and various friendship competitions.

VI. Various localities may, according to custom, carry out activities to comfort the troops, the sick and wounded, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and the families of martyrs and soldiers.

    关于一九五三年新年至春节期间进行拥军优属和拥政爱民工作的指示
    一九五三年新年春节期间，地方人民政府应领导当地人民群众进行拥护人民军队和优待烈、军属及革命残废军人的工作；同时，在中国人民解放军的全体人员中，应进行拥护人民政府和爱护人民的工作。在军爱民、民拥军的口号下进一步提高觉悟，加强团结，巩固国防，开展大规模的经济建设，并粉碎美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。
    一、要在地方工作人员和人民群众中深入宣传人民军队的优良品质和英勇作战的事迹。如人民军队的英勇杀敌，保卫边疆，参加建设，学习文化，热爱祖国，热爱人民等等。并说明人民军队之所以有如此优良的品质，是因为他们是人民的子弟兵，有中国共产党的领导，并受到毛主席的培养与教育的结果。为了生动具体地进行这个教育，可邀请军队中的战斗英雄、学习模范和中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团作报告，或组织座谈，用他们亲自经历和目睹耳闻的事例来说明人民军队确是最可爱的人，以加强拥军优属的观念。
    二、要深入宣传三年来我们祖国建设的伟大成就，并说明这是因为有了毛主席及各级人民政府的正确领导，和广大人民艰苦奋斗创造的成绩。为了生动具体地进行这个教育，在部队中可邀请当地党政干部和拥军优属模范、劳动模范作报告，或组织座谈，以加强拥政爱民的观念。
    三、要对优抚工作进行一次深入的检查，以烈、军属和革命残废军人的生活有无保障和已否提高，作为检查的主要标准。具体的方法是：检查代耕和生产的收获量，评选优抚模范，提出整顿代耕和进一步组织烈、军属和革命残废军人生产的办法，使代耕与互助组及农业生产合作社结合起来，并调整代耕的负担，以便做到产量有确切的保证。在业已完成了优抚模范评选工作的地区，应把重点放在计划代耕与组织烈、军属生产的工作上。同时，应检查优抚事业费的使用情况，看发放是否适当及时。城市应对烈、军属转业军人的生产就业情况作一次检查，发现问题，及时解决，务使他们生产就业各得其所。对于有关军民关系的问题，也要作检查，特别是对于处理部队给地方政府的函件（包括人民来信），应作为政府机关检查的内容之一。
    四、要在军队中就群众纪律进行一次大检查，以我军三大纪律八项注意作标准。具体的办法是：召开驻地居民座谈会，虚心征求群众的意见，发扬批评与自我批评的精神，检查与揭露各种违犯群众纪律的现象；驻城市的部队和军事机关人员，应特别检查关于遵守公共秩序的情形。驻在少数民族地区的部队，要深入学习民族政策，检查有无违反政策及违反少数民族风俗习惯的情事。所有部队对于人民来信及提出的要求或批评，都应十分重视，认真迅速地处理，不得置之不理。此项也应作为检查的内容之一。
    五、进行军民互助与军民联欢的工作，如地方应组织群众帮助驻军解决困难，组织劳动模范给驻军指导生产技术，组织熟悉地方情况的人向驻军讲解地方情况。部队则应派人帮助当地民兵的训练和群众的文化学习运动，如邀请他们参观部队生活，参加军事、政治、文化、体育活动，赠送他们一些图书和文化娱乐器材，同他们讲解军事知识，宣传战斗英雄故事等。并组织军民联欢和各种友谊比赛。
    六、各地可依习惯进行对驻军、伤病员、革命残废军人及烈、军属的慰问活动。
