    Socialist Realism - The Road for Chinese Literature to Advance
    Zhou Yang

    Editor's Note: This article was written by Comrade Zhou Yang for the Soviet literary magazine "Znamya" and was published in the December 1952 issue of the magazine. It is reprinted here for the reference of literary workers.

    Great Soviet literature occupies an important position in the lives of the Chinese people and has given Chinese literature a tremendous influence.

    The Chinese people, whether before liberation or after achieving great victory, have always drawn confidence, courage, and experience in their struggle from Soviet literature. In this literature, we see a most advanced, beautiful, and truly representative of human happiness social system that has never existed in the world, and we see examples of the highest human qualities and the most sublime morality. The powerful strength of Soviet literature lies in its ability to observe and express life from the standpoint of communist ideology, to combine today's reality with tomorrow's ideals. In other words, its strength lies in the method of socialist realism.

    Socialist realism has now become the banner of all progressive writers in the world, and the literature of the Chinese people is advancing under this banner. Just as the Chinese new democratic revolution is a component part of the proletarian socialist world revolution, so the literature of the Chinese people is a component part of the world's socialist realist literature. Comrade Mao Zedong once said in "On New Democracy" regarding the May Fourth New Culture Movement:

    "The May Fourth Movement came into being at the call of the world revolution, at the call of the Russian Revolution, at the call of Lenin."

    In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Comrade Mao Zedong more profoundly and clearly stated the significance of the Russian October Revolution for the Chinese people. He said:

    "The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese did not know Lenin or Stalin, nor did they know Marx or Engels. The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October revolution helped the advanced elements of the whole world and of China to adopt the proletarian world outlook as an instrument for studying the destiny of the country and re-considering their own problems. Follow the path of the Russians—that was their conclusion."

    "Follow the path of the Russians," so it is politically, and so it is in literature and art.

    Without the great influence of the October Socialist Revolution and the assistance of the Soviet Union, the historical victory of the Chinese people's revolution would be unimaginable. Similarly, without the great influence and demonstration of Soviet literature born of the October Socialist Revolution, the achievements of Chinese people's literature today would be unimaginable.

    The literature of the modern Chinese people grows on the fertile soil of Chinese reality. It inherits all the excellent traditions of China's long, rich, and brilliant literary heritage, and skillfully links these traditions with the new tasks of the nation. In the field of literature and art, we have opposed and will continue to oppose all tendencies to blindly worship Western bourgeois literature. Chinese literature must have its own unique and distinct national style. However, the national characteristics of Chinese literature are by no means isolated, narrow, or closed-door. On the contrary, Chinese literature can and should absorb all the progressive and beneficial things of world literature on the basis of its own national tradition. Throughout its entire development, Chinese literature has always enriched and improved itself by learning from the advanced experience of world literature. Among all foreign literatures, Russian and Soviet literature have had a particularly great influence on Chinese literature. Lu Xun, the greatest writer in China, as early as 1932, in his article "Congratulations on the Communication between Chinese and Russian Characters," enthusiastically described with gratitude the profound influence of Russian and Soviet literature on the Chinese people and the solid spiritual connection between the Chinese and Russian peoples that was established as a result.

    Lu Xun recalled the situation when Russian literature was first introduced to China at the end of the 19th century, writing: "At that time, we knew that Russian literature was our teacher and friend. Because from it, we saw the kind souls, the bitterness, and the struggles of the oppressed... From literature, we understood a major event: that there are two kinds of people in the world: oppressors and the oppressed! From today's perspective, this is clear to everyone and insignificant, but at that time, it was a great discovery, no less than the ancient people's discovery of fire that could illuminate the dark night and cook things."

    This lofty assessment is entirely consistent with reality, because the profound exposure and depiction of class contradictions and struggles in literary works greatly helped the Chinese people seek the road to liberation, and also helped Chinese literature embark on the road of revolutionary realism. Lu Xun himself benefited from Russian literature from the very beginning of his creative life. He did exemplary work in introducing Russian and Soviet literature. He excellently translated Gogol's "Dead Souls" and Fadeyev's "The Rout."

    China's revolutionary democratic intellectuals, from the oldest generation onwards, had almost all been more or less exposed to Russian literature and deeply attracted to it. The reason why Russian literature had a special attraction was that it showed how the Russian people had waged a long and unyielding struggle against the oppressors and enslavers of the people in order to win humanity's noble ideals. It showed the Russian people's freedom-loving, intelligent, and courageous national character. Whether it was Pushkin and Gogol, Tolstoy and Turgenev, Chekhov and Gorky, in the minds of Chinese readers they were as close as their own writers; the characters in their writings were also as close to us. Although some of the characters in Russian classical literature, as the great Russian critic Dobrolyubov correctly pointed out, lacked sufficient strength of action, these characters were always incompatible with the ugly reality around them and passionately pursued freedom and light. It was precisely on this point that they gave great enlightenment and encouragement to the advanced democratic intellectuals of the time.

    Gorky enjoyed the highest position among Chinese readers, unmatched by any foreign writer. Reading his "The Song of the Stormy Petrel" and "The Song of the Falcon," we felt a truly Russian revolutionary spirit. Reading his "Mother," we saw for the first time in literature the character of the fighting Russian working class, which could serve as a glorious example for the world's working class.

    Comrade Fadeyev said: "There are many things in common between the characters of the Chinese people and the Russian people." This similarity is undoubtedly due to the fact that the people of both countries have been in similar historical conditions, because the people of both countries have waged long struggles to win their national independence and freedom. We are proud of this similarity in character between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

    Due to the historical victory of the Chinese people, the "communication between Chinese and Russian characters" sung by Lu Xun, where the people of the two countries have long been in harmony, has been unprecedentedly developed and further consolidated under a completely new condition. Now, Soviet literature, art, and film are not only examples for Chinese writers and art workers to learn from, but also a powerful spiritual force for educating and inspiring the vast number of Chinese people with communist ideology, becoming an indispensable and most valuable content of the new cultural life of the Chinese people. Soviet works such as "The Iron Flood," "The Rout", "Cement", "And Quiet Flows the Don", "Virgin Soil Upturned", "How the steel was tempered", "The Young Guard", "Days and Nights", "The Russian People", "Front" and so on have long been familiar to the broad masses of Chinese readers. The noble types of the Soviet people depicted in Soviet literary works have not only been loved by thousands of Chinese readers, but also live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people. Pavel Korchagin, Danya, Matrosov, and Oleg have become models for countless young people in our country.

    We are particularly pleased that the works of the young New China's literature, art, and film have been valued in the Soviet Union, and their ideological and artistic values have been praised by Soviet readers and audiences. Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sangkan River", Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane", He Jingzhi and Ding Yi's "The White-Haired Girl" winning the Stalin Prize in 1951 gave the Chinese people and Chinese literary and art workers great glory. This is the highest reward for our Chinese writers, and more importantly, it is an encouragement for our Chinese writers to write even better works.

    The increasingly strengthened cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union are of great significance for helping the development of Chinese literature and art. This significance is not only literary, but also political. Everyone knows that the great Sino-Soviet friendship is the most important factor in defending peace in the East and the world, and further strengthening Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges is a good way to further consolidate this great friendship.

    The task facing the Chinese people, especially literary and art workers, is to actively popularize Soviet literature, art, and film more widely among the Chinese people, and literary and art workers should work harder to learn from the creative experience and artistic techniques of Soviet writers, especially to deeply study socialist realism as the basis of their creation.

    At present, Chinese literature, as a whole, is not yet entirely socialist literature, but is socialist and democratic literature under the guidance of socialist realism. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in "On New Democracy":

    "New-democratic politics, economics, and culture are all socialist in nature because they are all led by the proletariat, and not ordinary factors, but decisive factors."

    "We have socialist elements in politics and economics, and these are reflected in our national culture as well."

    Judging whether a work is socialist realist or not depends mainly not on whether the content it depicts is socialist reality, but on expressing the truth of life in revolutionary development from a socialist point of view and position. Many of our works, such as the aforementioned award-winning works by Comrade Ding Ling and others, as well as some works by Zhao Shuli and other writers, depict the lives and struggles of peasants. But these works are not peasant literature or general democratic literature, but socialist realist literature. Because in these works, the authors do not describe the peasants from the point of view of ordinary peasants or general democrats, but from the socialist point of view of the working class. They observed the fate of the peasants with the eyes of the working class, and expressed the peasants' revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, the changes in their living conditions, and the process of their ideological awareness. They praised the endless revolutionary perseverance of the peasants, and also criticized their various conservative and backward mentalities, consciousness, and habits. Describing the liberation of the peasants actually means describing the leadership of the working class over the peasants. The peasant activists and Communists in the works are no longer ordinary peasants, but the vanguard of the working class in the countryside. Works depicting the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers embody a high degree of integration of patriotism and internationalism in the people's soldiers.

    Our country is entering a new historical stage of large-scale economic construction. The socialist elements in political, economic, and cultural life will undoubtedly increase day by day. On the industrial production front, the working class stands in the position of the leading class of the country, and their high degree of labor enthusiasm is inseparable from their socialist consciousness. In rural areas, peasants will gradually embark on the road of agricultural production cooperation. Intellectuals and young students are being educated in the Marxist worldview. All this will provide an expanding realistic foundation for socialist realism in literature.

    Of course, China still needs to go through a considerable process to become a socialist society. Although the socialist economy is the leading force in the entire national economy and is developing at an astonishing speed, China can still be said to be a country of small producers in a wide range. There is still a bourgeoisie in China, and this situation is reflected in literature by the widespread influence of bourgeois, especially petty-bourgeois, ideology and the resulting strong struggle of socialist realists against the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois influences.

    It must be admitted that today's Chinese socialist realist literature is still far from mature; it is still in the process of growth. This is mainly because Chinese writers' Marxist-Leninist cultivation, life experience, and artistic attainments are still insufficient. This makes it even more necessary for us to learn from Soviet socialist realist literature.

    So, what exactly do we learn from socialist realism, and how do we learn it?

    Socialist realism first of all requires writers to truthfully express reality in the revolutionary development of reality. In life, there are always contradictions and struggles between the advancing, newborn things and the backward, dying things. Writers should deeply reveal the contradictions in life, clearly see the leading trends in the development of reality, and thus firmly support the new things and oppose the old things. Therefore, when we comment on the ideological nature of a work, we mainly look at whether it reveals the social class contradictions—these contradictions are meticulously manifested in all aspects of life—and whether the revelation is profound. Any tendency to cover up, embellish, or dilute the contradictions in life is a violation of the truth of reality, reduces the ideological combat effectiveness of literature, and weakens the positive role of literature.

    In the past three years, the Chinese people have achieved great achievements in the heroic struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, in land reform and other social reform movements, and in economic recovery and construction. Countless heroic and model figures and deeds have emerged on all fronts of national construction. This is what our literature should first express and praise. But at the same time, it must be pointed out that the tremendous achievements our country has made in the past three years under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party have come from overcoming numerous great difficulties. On the one hand, the Chinese people must continue to struggle with imperialism, and on the other hand, they must begin large-scale domestic peaceful construction. In our country, the existence of a vast number of scattered small producers is contrary to the requirements of national industrialization; the old ideas and habits remaining in people's consciousness and life, such as the selfish and conservative concepts of peasants, are contrary to the people's increasing political awareness. Some of our writers often dare not describe the difficulties and contradictions in reality, and do not know that to express the achievements of our country is to express the arduous process of overcoming difficulties. Some of our writers often simplify and vulgarize revolutionary optimism, writing the arrival of victory as very easy. When they come into contact with the contradictions in life, they not only dare not expand it, but also dilute and smooth it out in order to avoid making "mistakes." In this way, they write the torrent of life as calm and tranquil or only with small waves.

    Fadeyev's "The Rout" tells the story of a guerrilla unit during the civil war. This guerrilla unit had only nineteen people left at the end, but from their invincible revolutionary will and confidence, they were still victorious. Therefore, what moves readers about this work is not a sense of defeat at all, but precisely the spirit of tenacious revolutionary optimism. The same can be said of his "The Young Guard." "Only in a storm can the strength of the grass be known." Only in overcoming huge difficulties and contradictions can the true power of revolutionary optimism be shown.

    To express the struggle between new forces and old forces in life, it is necessary to focus on expressing the true face of the characters representing the new forces. Such characters should play a positive and offensive role in the work and be able to change the surrounding life. Only through such new characters can the work truly educate the masses in the socialist spirit. Our writers are generally not good at portraying new characters; they are more skilled at portraying old characters and events. New characters often lack character. Writers often only portray the appearance of new life, the common political outlines of new characters, without deeply portraying their personality and their minds. In this way, our many works are lifeless, dry, and formulaic. Soviet literature has created completely new characters who are building the communist world, which is particularly worthy of our writers to learn from.

    For us, the most important thing today in learning from Soviet literature's socialist realism is to learn how to describe the contradictions and struggles between new and old forces in life, and how to create the character of new characters who embody the noble morality and qualities of communism.

    The works of many outstanding Soviet writers are the best models for us to learn from in this regard. Comrade Stalin's instructions on literature and art, the historical resolutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU on literary and ideological issues, Comrade Zhdanov's speeches on literary issues, and the instructions on the literary part of Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU recently, all of these provide the richest and most valuable experience for Chinese and all progressive literature and art in the world, giving us the most correct and most important guidance.

    Our learning from Soviet literature does not hinder, but on the contrary, is sufficient to help our literature inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of our own nation. The realist tradition of Chinese literature has a long history. The revolutionary democratic realism since the May Fourth Movement, represented by Lu Xun, opened up a new era in the history of Chinese literature and prepared the conditions for the development of socialist realism.

    Lu Xun's realism is mainly manifested in his hatred of the darkness of old China and his enthusiasm and pursuit of new China, as well as his clear right and wrong and his principle of passionate love and hatred. He created the typical character of Ah Q, on the one hand, giving full sympathy to his humiliation and harm, and on the other hand, giving a painful lash to his unconscious fatal weakness.

    Many realist works of Chinese classical writers also truthfully described social struggles and portrayed character. "Water Margin," China's first great novel produced six hundred years ago, profoundly describes the struggle of peasants against feudal bureaucratic landlords. Although this struggle has its inevitable backwardness and primitiveness, it reached such a high level of form: the rebellious peasants established their own base—Liangshanpo, and organized their own army and government. "Water Margin" portrays one hundred and eight heroes, many of whom are typical characters with completely different personalities. Another great novel, "Dream of the Red Chamber," created as many as four hundred and forty-eight male and female characters. This is also a rare phenomenon in the history of world literature. Today's Chinese literature should inherit and carry forward the excellent tradition of Chinese ancient literature in describing struggle and character. The new socialist realist literature can only become truly people's literature when it consciously, and of course critically, absorbs the excellent traditions of its own national heritage.

    Therefore, we must learn from advanced Soviet literature based on the life of our own people and the literary traditions of our own nation. Following in the wake of Soviet literature, our literature has begun to embark on the road of socialist realism; we will continue to advance on this road.

    社会主义现实主义——中国文学前进的道路
    周扬
    编者按：这篇文章是周扬同志为苏联文学杂志“旗帜”写的，载于该杂志一九五二年十二月号。现转载于此，供文艺工作者参考。
    伟大的苏联文学在中国人民的生活中占有重要的地位，并给与了中国文学以巨大的影响。
    中国人民，不论在解放之前或者在已经取得伟大胜利之后，总是经常地从苏联文学中吸取斗争的信心、勇气和经验。在这个文学中，我们看到了世界上从所未有的一种最先进的、美好的、真正体现了人间幸福的社会制度，看到了人类最高尚的品格和最崇高的道德的范例。苏联文学的强大力量就在于：它是站在共产主义思想的立场上来观察和表现生活，善于把今天的现实和明天的理想结合起来，换句话说，它的力量就在社会主义现实主义的方法。
    社会主义现实主义，现在已成为全世界一切进步作家的旗帜，中国人民的文学正在这个旗帜之下前进。正如中国新民主主义革命是无产阶级社会主义世界革命的组成部分一样，中国人民的文学也是世界社会主义现实主义文学的组成部分。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中，关于“五四”新文化运动，曾经说过：
    “‘五四’运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。”
    在“论人民民主专政”中，毛泽东同志更深刻而明晰地述说了俄国十月革命对中国人民的意义。他说：
    “中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁，斯大林，也不知道马克思，恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”
    “走俄国人的路”，政治上如此，文学艺术上也是如此。
    没有十月社会主义革命的伟大影响和苏联的援助，中国人民革命的历史性的胜利是不可想像的。同样，没有由十月社会主义革命所诞生的苏联文学的伟大影响和示范，中国人民文学在今天的成就也是不可想像的。
    现代中国人民的文学是在中国现实生活的肥沃土壤上生长起来的，它继承了中国悠久的、丰富的、灿烂的文学遗产中的一切优良传统，并将这些传统和国家当前的新的任务巧妙地联结起来。在文学艺术的领域内，我们曾经反对了而且仍要继续反对一切盲目崇拜西方资产阶级文学的倾向。中国文学必须具有自己独特的鲜明的民族风格。但是中国文学的民族特点，决不是什么孤立的、狭隘的、闭关自守的东西，恰恰相反，中国文学可能而且应当在自己民族传统的基础上吸收世界文学的一切前进的有益的东西。中国文学，在它整个发展过程中，就始终是以学习世界文学的先进经验来丰富和提高自己的。在各种外国文学中，俄国文学和苏联文学给了中国文学以特别巨大的影响。中国最伟大的作家鲁迅，早在一九三二年所写的“祝中俄文字之交”一文中，就以充满感激的心怀热情地描写了俄国和苏联文学对中国人民的深刻影响以及由此而建立起来的中俄两国人民的牢固的精神联系。
    鲁迅回忆着十九世纪末叶俄国文学刚被介绍到中国来的情况，这样地写道：“那时就知道了俄国文学是我们的导师和朋友。因为从那里面，看见了被压迫者的善良的灵魂，的酸辛，的挣扎……从文学里明白了一件大事，是世界上有两种人：压迫者和被压迫者！从现在看来，这是谁都明白，不足道的，但在那时，却是一个大发见，正不亚于古人的发见了火的可以照暗夜，煮东西。”
    这个崇高的估价是完全符合实际的，因为在文学作品中对阶级的矛盾和斗争的深刻揭露和描写，极大地帮助了中国人民寻求解放的道路，同时也帮助了中国文学走上革命的现实主义的道路。鲁迅自己在他的创作生活中从一开始就受到了俄国文学的益处。他在介绍俄国文学和苏联文学上做了模范的工作。他十分出色地翻译了果戈理的“死魂灵”和法捷耶夫的“毁灭”。
    中国革命的民主的知识分子，从最老的一代起，几乎都或多或少地接触过俄国文学并为它所深深吸引。俄国文学之所以具有特别的吸引力，就在它表现了俄国人民如何为争取人类崇高理想而对人民的压迫者、奴役者作了坚忍不拔的斗争，表现了俄国人民的爱好自由的、智慧而勇敢的民族性格。不论是普式庚和果戈理、托尔斯泰和屠格涅夫、契诃夫和高尔基，在中国读者的心目中是如同本国的作家一样亲近的；他们笔下的人物，对于我们也是一样地亲近。俄国古典文学作品中的人物，虽然有的，像俄国的伟大批评家杜布洛留勃夫所曾正确指出的一样，还缺少足够的行动的力量，但这些人物却总是和他们周围丑恶的现实不相容的，热烈地追求自由和光明的，正是在这点上，对当时中国先进的民主的知识分子给与了极大的启示和鼓舞。
    高尔基在中国读者中享有了任何外国作家所无法比拟的最崇高的地位。读了他的“海燕”和“鹰之歌”，我们感到了一种真正俄国的革命气魄。读了他的“母亲”，我们第一次在文学中看到了战斗的俄国工人阶级的性格，这种性格可以作为世界工人阶级的光荣榜样。
    法捷耶夫同志说：“在中国人民和俄国人民的性格中，有很多东西是相近的”。这种相近毫无疑问是由于两国人民曾处于类似的历史条件，因为两国人民都曾为争取自己民族的独立和自由而作了长期的斗争。我们为中苏两国人民在性格上的这种相近而感到自豪。
    由于中国人民的历史性的胜利，为鲁迅所歌颂的中苏两国人民早已心心相印的“文字之交”，就在一个完全新的条件下获得了空前的开展和更进一步的巩固。现在苏联的文学、艺术和电影已经不只是作为中国作家和艺术工作者的学习的范例，而且是作为以共产主义思想教育和鼓舞广大中国人民的强大精神力量，成为中国人民新的文化生活的不可缺少的最宝贵的内容了。苏联的作品，如“铁流”、“毁灭”、“士敏土”、“静静的顿河”、“被开垦的处女地”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“青年近卫军”、“日日夜夜”、“俄罗斯人”、“前线”等，早已为中国广大读者所熟习。苏联的文学作品中所描写的苏联人民的高尚典型，已经不仅被千千万万的中国读者所热爱，而且永远活在中国人民的心中了。保尔·柯察金、丹孃、马特洛索夫和奥列格已经成为我国无数青年的表率。
    使我们感到特别高兴的，是年青的新中国的文学、艺术和电影的作品在苏联受到了重视，它们的思想和艺术价值得到了苏联读者、观众的推崇。丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”、周立波的“暴风骤雨”、贺敬之、丁毅的“白毛女”获得一九五一年斯大林奖金，使中国人民和中国文艺工作者感到极大的光荣。这是对于我们中国作家的一个最高酬报，而更重要的，也是对我们中国作家的一个鼓励，鼓励我们写出更好的作品。
    中苏两国之间正在日益加强的文化交流，对帮助中国文学艺术的发展，具有重要的意义。这个意义还不只是文学上的，同时也是政治上的。大家都知道，伟大的中苏友谊是保卫东方和世界和平的最重要因素，而进一步加强中苏文化交流也就是进一步巩固这个伟大友谊的良好方法。
    摆在中国人民，特别是文艺工作者面前的任务，就是积极地使苏联文学、艺术、电影更广泛地普及到中国人民中去，而文艺工作者则应当更努力地学习苏联作家的创作经验和艺术技巧，特别是深刻地去研究作为他们创作基础的社会主义现实主义。
    目前中国文学，就整个说来，还不完全是社会主义的文学，而是在社会主义现实主义指导之下社会主义和民主主义的文学。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中十分明确地指出：
    “新民主主义的政治、经济、文化，由于其都是无产阶级领导的缘故，就都具有社会主义的因素，并且不是普通的因素，而是起决定作用的因素。”
    “我们在政治上经济上有社会主义的因素，反映到我们的国民文化也有社会主义的因素”。
    判断一个作品是否社会主义现实主义的，主要不在它所描写的内容是否社会主义的现实生活，而是在于以社会主义的观点、立场来表现革命发展中的生活的真实。我们的许多作品，例如上述得奖的丁玲等同志的作品以及赵树理和其它作家的一些作品，都是描写农民的生活和斗争的。但这些作品却不是农民文学或一般民主主义的文学，而是社会主义现实主义的文学。因为在这些作品中，作者并不是以普通农民的或一般的民主主义的观点而是以工人阶级的社会主义的观点来描写农民的，他们以工人阶级的眼光观察了农民的命运，表现了在共产党领导之下农民的从事革命斗争，他们的生活地位的变化和思想觉悟的过程。他们歌颂了农民无穷无尽的革命毅力，同时也批评了他们的各种保守的、落后的心理、意识和习惯。描写了农民的翻身，实际也就是描写了工人阶级对农民的领导。作品中的农民的积极分子和共产党员，已经不是普通农民，而是在农村的工人阶级的先锋队。描写人民解放军和人民志愿军的作品，在人民战士的身上体现了爱国主义和国际主义的高度的结合。
    我们的国家正进入大规模经济建设的新的历史阶段。政治、经济、文化生活中的社会主义的因素无疑地将日益增长。在工业生产战线上，工人阶级是站在国家的领导阶级的地位，他们的高度的劳动热忱是和他们的社会主义的觉悟分不开的。在农村中，农民将逐步走上农业生产合作的道路。知识分子和青年学生正受着马克思主义世界观的教育。这一切就将要为文学上的社会主义现实主义提供日益扩大的现实的基础。
    自然，中国要变为社会主义的社会，还需要经过
    一个相当的过程。虽然社会主义经济是整个国民经济的领导力量，并正在以可惊的速度发展着，但在广大范围内，中国目前仍可以说是一个小生产者的国家。在中国还有资产阶级存在，这种情况反映到文学上，就是文学中资产阶级、特别是小资产阶级思想的广泛影响以及由此产生的社会主义现实主义者对于小资产阶级、资产阶级影响的强烈斗争。
    必须承认，今天中国的社会主义现实主义文学还是远不够成熟的，它还在成长的过程中。这主要地是因为中国作家的马克思列宁主义的修养，生活经验和艺术造诣都还不够的原故。这就使得我们向苏联社会主义现实主义文学学习成为更加必要了。
    那末，究竟向社会主义现实主义学习一些什么，以及如何去学习呢？
    社会主义现实主义首先要求作家在现实的革命的发展中真实地去表现现实。生活中总是有前进的、新生的东西和落后的、垂死的东西之间的矛盾和斗争，作家应当深刻地去揭露生活中的矛盾，清楚地看出现实发展的主导倾向，因而坚决地去拥护新的东西，而反对旧的东西。因此当我们评论一篇作品的思想性的时候，主要就是看它是否揭露了社会阶级的矛盾——这种矛盾是无微不至地表现在生活的各方面的——以及揭露是否深刻。任何企图掩盖、粉饰和冲淡生活中的矛盾的倾向，都是违背现实的真实，减低文学的思想战斗力，削弱文学的积极作用的。
    三年来，中国人民在抗美援朝的英勇斗争中，在土地改革以及其它各种社会改革运动中，在经济的恢复和建设中，获得了伟大的成就，在国家建设的各个战线上出现了无数的英雄模范的人物和事迹。这是我们的文学首先应当加以表现和歌颂的。但是同时必须指出：三年来我们的国家在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导之下所获得的巨大成就是从克服了重重的巨大困难得来的。中国人民一方面要继续和帝国主义进行斗争，另一方面要开始大规模的国内的和平建设。在我们国家，广大的分散的小生产者的存在是和国家工业化的要求相抵触的；人民意识和生活中残留的旧思想、旧习惯，例如农民的自私保守观念，是和人民日益提高的政治觉悟相抵触的。我们的有些作家往往不敢去描写现实中的困难和矛盾，而不知道，表现我们国家的成就，就是要表现克服困难的艰巨的过程。我们的有些作家往往把革命的乐观主义简单化、庸俗化了，把胜利的得来写成非常容易。他们接触到生活中的矛盾的时候，不但不敢去展开它，并且把它冲淡，磨平，为的避免犯“错误”。这样，他们就把生活的奔流写成了风平浪静或者仅有微小的波澜了。
    法捷耶夫的“毁灭”叙述了内战时期的一支游击队的故事，这支游击队打到最后只剩下了十九个人，但从他们的不可征服的革命意志和信心来看，他们仍然是胜利的。因此，这篇作品感动读者的东西，就不但丝毫不是失败的情绪，而恰恰是顽强的革命乐观主义的精神。对于他的“青年近卫军”，也同样可以这样地说。“疾风知劲草”，只有在克服巨大的困难和矛盾中，才能显示出革命乐观主义的真正力量。
    要表现生活中的新的力量和旧的力量之间的斗争，必须着重表现代表新的力量的人物的真实面貌，这种人物在作品中应当起积极的、进攻的作用，能够改变周围的生活。只有通过这种新人物，作品才能够真正作到用社会主义精神教育群众。我们的作家，一般地还不善于描写新的人物，对于描写旧的人物和事件倒是比较更为娴熟的。新的人物往往缺少性格，作家们常常是只描绘了新生活的外表，新人物的共同的政治的轮廓而没有深入地刻划出他们的个性，他们的心灵。这样，就造成了我们的许多作品的缺乏生命、枯燥无味和公式主义的毛病。苏联的文学创造了正在建设共产主义世界的完全新的人物的形象，这是特别值得我们的作家去学习的。
    向苏联文学的社会主义现实主义学习，对于我们，今天最重要的，就是学习如何描写生活中新的和旧的力量的矛盾和斗争，学习如何创造体现了共产主义高尚道德和品质的新的人物的性格。
    许多优秀苏联作家的作品，在这一方面都是我们学习的最好的范本。斯大林同志关于文艺的指示，联共中央关于文艺思想问题的历史性的决议，日丹诺夫同志的关于文艺问题的讲演，以及最近联共十九次党代表大会上马林科夫同志的报告中关于文艺部分的指示，所有这些，为中国和世界一切进步文艺提供了最丰富和最有价值的经验，给与了我们以最正确的、最重要的指南。
    我们向苏联文学学习，决不妨碍，而是恰恰相反，正足以帮助我们的文学继承和发扬自己民族的优秀传统。中国文学的现实主义传统是历史久远的。“五四”以来革命的民主主义的现实主义，以鲁迅为代表，则在中国文学史上开创了一个新的时代，并准备了向社会主义现实主义发展的条件。
    鲁迅的现实主义精神，主要表现在他对于旧中国的黑暗的仇视和对于新中国的热望和追求，以及他的是非分明，爱憎热烈的原则的态度上。他创造了阿Q的典型，一方面，对他的被侮辱与被损害寄予了充分的同情，另一方面，对他的不觉悟的致命的弱点给与了沉痛的鞭挞。
    中国古典作家的许多现实主义作品，也都真实地描写了社会斗争，刻划了人物性格。六百年以前所产生的中国第一部伟大的小说“水浒”，就深刻地描写了农民对封建官僚地主的斗争，这个斗争，尽管带有它的不可避免的落后性和原始性，却达到了如此高度的形式：反叛的农民们建立了自己的根据地——梁山泊，组织了自己的军队和政府。在“水浒”中刻划了一百零八个英雄，许多都是具有完全不同的个性的典型人物。另一部伟大的小说“红楼梦”中所创造的男女人物共达四百四十八人之多。这在世界文学史上也是罕有的现象。今天的中国文学应当把中国古代文学的这个善于描写斗争和性格的优秀传统很好地加以继承和发扬。新的社会主义现实主义的文学，只有当它有意识地、自然也是批判地吸收了自己民族遗产的优秀传统的时候，才能成为真正的人民的文学。
    因此，我们必须以本国人民的生活和自己民族的文学传统为依据，向先进的苏联文学学习。追踪在苏联文学之后，我们的文学已经开始走上了社会主义现实主义道路；我们将在这个道路上继续前进。
