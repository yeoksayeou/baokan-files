    Central South Military and Administrative Committee Decides
    To Register and Allocate Technical Cadres
    In order to welcome the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin, the Central South Military and Administrative Committee has issued a decision on the registration and allocation of technical cadres; and at the same time promulgated the "Measures for Registration and Return to Teams of Technical Cadres in the Central South Region."
    The decision pointed out: The country's large-scale economic construction is about to begin, and various construction undertakings require a large number of technical cadres, while the existing technical cadres are far from enough. In addition to strengthening the training of new technical cadres and improving the original technical cadres, it is necessary to resolutely concentrate technical cadres from all aspects to ensure the needs of major construction undertakings, especially the needs of important factory construction. In this regard, any egalitarianism and departmentalism will harm the cause of national industrialization, which is absolutely not allowed.
    In the "Measures for Registration and Return to Teams of Technical Cadres in the Central South Region", specific provisions are made for the scope, time and method of registration. At the same time, it instructs all production units to quickly formulate active rather than conservative plans for training technical cadres and technical workers, so as to continuously increase technical strength.
    The decision also stipulates that in the work of registration and allocation, those who deliberately ambush or delay and refuse to be transferred shall be punished as violating national discipline.

    中南军政委员会决定
    登记与调配技术干部
    中南军政委员会为了迎接即将展开的大规模经济建设，特发布关于登记与调配技术干部的决定；并同时颁发了“中南区技术干部登记归队办法”。
    决定指出：国家大规模的经济建设即将开始，各种建设事业均需要大批的技术干部，而现有的技术干部非常不够，除了加强培养新的技术干部并提高原有技术干部以外，必须从各方面坚决集中技术干部，以保证主要建设事业的需要，特别是重要工厂建设的需要。在这方面，任何平均主义与本位主义的思想均将损害国家工业化的事业，这是绝对不能容许的。
    在“中南区技术干部登记归队办法”中，具体规定了登记的范围、时间与方法，同时指示各生产单位必须迅速拟订出积极的而不是保守的培养技术干部技术工人的计划，以便不断增长技术力量。
    决定并规定：在登记与配备工作中，如有故意打埋伏，或拖延不服调动者，一律以违犯国家纪律论处。
