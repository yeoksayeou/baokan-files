    The System of Thrift in Construction Projects
    The Soviet newspaper "Gudok" published on December 19, 1952, an article by Babelian, Deputy Director of the Central Finance Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Railways, discussing how to implement thrift in railway construction projects. Here is an abstract:
    The 19th Party Congress called for strengthening the supervision of the implementation of economic plans and adherence to the thrift system through the ruble, not only generally in agencies and trusts, but also in each individual construction project. Such a system will enhance the responsibility of leaders at the grassroots level for completing plans and promote the reduction of expenditures.
    It is necessary to widely promote the experience of those advanced and profitable construction projects, especially in the correct organization of labor and the effective utilization of machinery.
    In recent years, some transportation construction projects have implemented the transition from mechanization of individual processes to comprehensive mechanization, and implemented rapid and flow-line operation methods. Some advanced organizations of the Bridge Construction General Administration and many other agencies are constantly improving the utilization of construction machinery.
    However, some individual, mainly small construction projects, still cannot use mechanized tools efficiently. This is one of the basic reasons for the high cost of construction projects. For example, some agencies of the Central Railway Construction Bureau only utilized 30 to 35 percent of the power of crushers and concrete mixers in the third quarter of this year, while many enterprises of the Eastern Railway Construction General Administration only utilized less than 20 percent of the power of such machines.
    Such waste is intolerable. In order to successfully complete the tasks facing railway workers in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to continuously improve labor productivity, and first of all, to be good at using the rich national machinery that equips our construction projects.
    One of the basic reasons for failing to complete the task of reducing construction costs in the transportation industry is excessive overhead. For example, the Orenburg Construction Management Office and the Central Asian Railway Construction Trust wasted one million rubles on various non-productive expenditures. The shortcoming lies in the fact that the general administration did not determine the budget for overhead expenses for its construction projects. This makes it possible for those undisciplined leaders and chief accountants to formulate various unnecessary expenditures and regard them as "other overhead expenses." From 1953, a strict system must be established to stipulate the annual and quarterly budget for all overhead items. Strict supervision should be implemented in the process of executing the budget. At the same time, it should also be precisely stipulated what kind of expenditures can be included under the "other expenditures" item. Special attention should be paid to the problems of small and parallel construction organizations. For example, in Kiev, there are the construction department of the Kiev branch of the Western Railway Construction Management Bureau, the department of the Kiev branch of the Industrial Construction General Administration, and the railway construction department of the Southwest Railway Bureau, etc. And this is not a unique example. There are also many overlapping construction organizations on the Moscow-Kursk Railway. This will lead to the dispersion of materials and the inability to make good use of mechanized tools.
    Merging small and parallel existing organizations so that these organizations can fully exert their productivity can help eliminate the phenomenon of material dispersion and concentrate them on the most important projects that have already started. In addition, merging organizations will also help reduce overhead and administrative expenses and lower construction costs.

    In order to conduct supervision, it is necessary to be familiar with the business
    The "Workers' Daily" published an editorial on December 18, 1952, pointing out that Soviet trade unions should strengthen the training of social supervisors so that they are familiar with the business they supervise in order to work more effectively. An abstract follows:
    Among the diverse activities of Soviet trade unions, the implementation of social supervision over the work of commercial networks and municipal public utilities agencies, and over residential construction and repair projects, occupies an important position. The full importance of this undertaking is immeasurable. Social supervisors have the responsibility to ensure the correct use of the huge funds allocated by the state for residential construction and public utilities agencies, to help improve the quality of services to workers and to continuously improve commerce and public canteens.
    In the Soviet Union, hundreds of thousands of activists enthusiastically participate in the work of social supervision. They use suggestions, advice, and criticism to help eliminate shortcomings in public service undertakings.
    The interests of the cause require strengthening social supervision with all efforts, making it deeper and more effective. To achieve this goal, it is first necessary to improve the business knowledge of activists, and the social activists themselves must be very familiar with the cause they are supervising.
    Not long ago, huge malpractices were uncovered in Branch No. 110 of the Voroshilovgrad Municipal Food Company. Trade union activists from several enterprises in the city had supervised the store. But why didn't they notice the major shortcomings in trade, and didn't uncover the serious malpractices? This is primarily because the supervision here is superficial and not in-depth. Some factory committees did not care about the training of activists when they dispatched them to various stores, and did not care about their daily work. This is an important reason why social supervisors cannot deeply understand the work of the store, and cannot prevent or uncover malpractices. The factory committees put their activists in an embarrassing position with this indifferent attitude and undermined their prestige among all employees.
    Currently, when social supervisors' work reports and elections have been held in almost all enterprises, when the ranks of activists of the workers' supply committees have been replenished with new people, the issue of training these social activists has special significance.
    The Secretariat of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions instructed the central, state, and factory trade union committees to hold seminars for supervisors within one month after the elections to teach them the basic knowledge of trade operations and the techniques of supervision. This decision must be implemented without delay. Factory committees should pay attention to ensuring that classes are conducted in a timely manner and that they have a high level, and pay attention to absorbing experienced experts to participate in the teaching work of activists. At the same time, activists should study the work experience of advanced supervisors in meetings and seminars.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    在建筑工程中的节约制度
    一九五二年十二月十九日苏联“汽笛报”刊载了苏联铁道部中央财务局副局长巴别梁论述在铁路建筑工程中如何实行节约的论文，摘要如下：
    党的第十九次代表大会要求通过卢布来加强对执行经济计划和遵守节约制度的监督，同时不仅一般地在机关和托辣斯中、而且也要在每一个个别的建筑工程中实行。这样的制度将提高基层环节领导人对完成计划的责任感，并促进开支的减缩。
    必须广泛地推广那些先进的、有盈利地进行着的建筑工程的经验，特别是在正确组织劳动和有效地利用机械方面。
    近年以来在一些运输建筑工程中，实行了由个别工序的机械化向全面机械化的过渡，实施了快速和流水作业法。桥梁建筑总管理局的一些先进组织和其他不少的机关正在不断地改善对建筑机械的利用。
    但是一些个别的，主要是小的建筑工程，还不能有效率地使用机械化的工具。这是造成建筑工程成本高的基本原因之一。例如中央铁路建筑局的一些机关在本年第三季度中只利用了碎石机和混凝土搅拌机动力的百分之三十到三十五，而东方铁路建筑总管理局的许多企业则只利用了这类机器的不及百分之二十的动力。
    这样的浪费现象是不能容许的。为了成功地完成铁路工作者在第五个五年计划中所面临的任务，就需要不断提高劳动生产率，首先是要善于使用那装备着我们建筑工程的丰富的祖国机器。
    在运输事业中，没有完成降低建筑成本的任务的基本原因之一是杂费过高。例如奥林布尔斯克建筑管理处和中亚细亚铁路建筑托辣斯在各种非生产的支出上浪费了一百万卢布。缺点在于总管理处没有为自己的建筑工程确定杂费的预算。这样就使那些不守纪律的领导人和总会计师有可能制订各种不必要的支出，并把它们看作是“其他杂费”。由一九五三年起，必须确立严格的制度来规定所有杂费项目的年度和季度预算。在执行预算过程中，应当实行严格的监督。同时也应当精确规定，那种支出才可以列入“其他支出”项下。应当特别注意小的和平行地进行工作的建筑组织的问题。例如在基辅就有西方铁路建筑管理总局基辅分局的建筑部门、工业建筑总管理局基辅分局的部门和西南铁路局的铁路建筑部门等等。而，这并不是绝无仅有的例子。在莫斯科——库尔斯克铁路上也有许多彼此重叠的建筑组织。而这就会引起物资的分散和不能很好地利用机械化工具的情况。
    合并小的与平行地存在着的组织，使这些组织的生产力能充分发挥，能够帮助消除物资的分散现象，把它们集中使用于最重要的已开工的工程上。此外，合并组织也将有助于杂费和行政管理费用的减缩和建筑成本的降低。
    为了进行监督，必须熟悉业务
    劳动报一九五二年十二月十八日发表社论，指出苏联职工会应加强对社会监督员的训练，使他们熟悉自己所监督的业务，以便更有效地进行工作。摘要如下：
    在苏联职工会的多种多样的活动中，对商业网和市政公用事业机关的工作，对住宅建筑与修理工程，实施社会监督，占有重要的地位。这一事业的全部重要性是难以估计的。社会监督员有责任来保证正确使用国家所拨给的住宅建筑和公用事业机关的巨额资金，帮助提高对劳动者的服务的质量和不断改进商业和公共食堂。
    在苏联，有几十万积极分子踊跃地参加了社会监督的工作。他们用建议、劝告和批评来帮助消灭公用服务事业中的缺点。
    事业的利益要求以全力加强社会监督，使它更深入，更有效。为了达到这个目的，首先需要提高积极分子的业务知识，社会活动家本人必需很好地熟悉所监督的事业。
    不久前，伏罗希洛夫格勒市市立食品公司第一一○号支店被揭发了巨大的舞弊行为。市内几个企业的工会积极分子曾对该店进行了监督。但是为什么他们没有注意到贸易中的重大缺点，没有揭发严重的舞弊行为呢？这首先是因为这里的监督是表面的、不深入的。一些工厂委员会在把积极分子调派到各个商店中去的时候，没有关怀对他们的训练，不关心他们的日常工作。这就是社会监督员们不能深刻了解商店的工作，既无法防止又不能揭发舞弊行为的重要原因。工厂委员会用这种漠不关心的态度使自己的积极分子处于尴尬的地位，并破坏了他们在全体员工中的威信。
    目前，当各企业几乎都举行了社会监督员的工作报告和选举的时候，当工人供给委员会的积极分子队伍增添了新人的时候，这些社会活动家的训练问题便具有特别重要的意义。
    全苏工会中央理事会秘书处曾责成中央、各州和各工厂的工会委员会在举行选举后的一个月内，为监督员们举办习明纳尔，教他们以贸易业务的基础知识和监督的技术。这一决定必须毫不迟延地予以执行。工厂委员会应当注意使课务能及时进行和使它具有高度的水平，注意吸收有经验的专家来参加对积极分子的教学工作。同时积极分子在会议和习明纳尔中，应当对先进的监督员的工作经验加以研究。
