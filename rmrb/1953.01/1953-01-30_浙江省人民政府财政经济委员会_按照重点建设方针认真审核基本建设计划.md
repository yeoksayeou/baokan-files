    The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee
    Seriously Reviews Basic Construction Plans in Accordance with the Guiding Principles of Key Construction
    The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee resolutely implemented the central government's guiding principle of concentrating funds on key construction and corrected the tendency of some units to revive everything at once.
    Although the Zhejiang Provincial Finance and Economics Committee repeatedly explained the central government's key construction guiding principles to leading cadres of various departments at various meetings, many enterprise departments and government units in the province and Hangzhou City still exposed many extravagant and wasteful ideas that disregarded the overall situation when preparing the 1953 basic construction plan. For example, the Hangzhou Municipal Construction Bureau planned to spend 7.2 billion yuan to widen an already broad and beautiful road by another 100 percent. Their reason was that Hangzhou is a famous place for international friends to visit, and the existing road is not grand enough. They did not consider that realizing this plan would require demolishing 490 shops and houses on both sides of the road. Such a huge waste of funds and indirectly created losses would be incalculable. Another example is the Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory. According to the production plan for 1953 stipulated by the higher authorities, the existing production equipment is already sufficient; the factory's welfare facilities are also the most complete in Zhejiang. However, they created a huge plan requiring hundreds of billions of yuan. They already have a large auditorium that can accommodate 2,000 people, but they plan to build an even more beautiful auditorium. They already have bathroom facilities, but they still want to build a public bathhouse. Last year, the factory carried out a greening project, but they plan to green the factory environment again. In addition, they also plan to build a health clinic and worker's family dormitories, etc.
    When reviewing these plans, the Zhejiang Provincial Finance and Economics Committee resolutely eliminated these "large-scale everywhere" plans that did not take into account the overall situation, or put forward detailed opinions in the review comments stating that they should be eliminated, along with the basis for the elimination. At present, the entire basic construction plan of Zhejiang Province has been compiled and reviewed and sent to the central government for review. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government stipulates that before the entire plan for the basic construction plan for the 1953 fiscal year and the trans-annual projects of 1952 is approved, no blind construction is allowed. However, many enterprise departments and government units in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City did not conscientiously implement this guiding principle. Before the entire plan was approved, some departments called the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee and wrote reports with words like "urgent" and "emergency", requesting immediate allocation of funds to start construction. In response to this situation, the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, in addition to repeatedly explaining the central government's guiding principles to various departments, also stipulated that all those that do not meet the central government's regulations and requirements will not be allocated funds for construction.

    浙江省人民政府财政经济委员会
    按照重点建设方针认真审核基本建设计划
    浙江省人民政府财政经济委员会坚决贯彻执行中央关于集中资金进行重点建设的方针，纠正了某些单位百废俱兴的偏向。
    浙江省财政经济委员会在召开的各种会议上，虽然把中央重点建设的方针反复地向各部门的领导干部作了说明，但是省和杭州市的不少企业部门和机关单位，在编制一九五三年基本建设计划时，仍然暴露出许多铺张浪费与不顾全局的思想。例如杭州市建设局计划用七十二亿元把现有的一条宽阔漂亮的马路再放宽一倍，他们所持的理由是杭州为国际友人游览的盛地，现有的马路不够壮观。他们根本没有考虑到要实现这一计划，需要把马路两侧的四百九十户商店和房屋拆掉，这样庞大的资金浪费和间接造成的损失是无法计算的。又如浙江麻纺织厂，依照上级规定的一九五三年的生产计划，现有的生产设备已经够用；他们工厂的福利设施也是浙江最完善的。可是他们又造了一个需款数百亿元的庞大计划。他们现有可容两千人的大礼堂，还计划再建筑一个更漂亮的礼堂。他们已有浴室设备，还要修盖公共浴池。去年工厂里曾经进行过绿化工程，他们又计划把工厂环境再绿化一次。此外，他们还打算修建保健院与工人眷属宿舍等。
    浙江省财政经济委员会在审核这些计划时，对这些“处处大规模”和不照顾全局的错误的计划，采取了坚决予以剔除或在审核计划的意见书中提出应予剔除的详尽意见和根据。目前浙江省整个基本建设计划已编审完毕送中央审核。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会规定：凡是一九五三年度的基本建设计划和一九五二年的跨年度工程，当整个计划还未批准前，不准盲目动工。可是浙江省和杭州市不少企业部门和机关，却不认真地执行这一方针，整个计划还未批示下来，有些部门就给省财政经济委员会打电话，写“特急”、“紧急”等字样的报告，要求立即拨款动工。省财政经济委员会针对这一情况，除了反复向各部门解释中央的方针，并规定凡是不合乎中央规定和要求的，一律不予拨款动工。（新华社）
