Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Tokyo News: The US aggressors have turned Hokkaido, which is close to the Soviet border, into one of the main US military bases in Japan. Airports, barracks, and training grounds are spread across Hokkaido like a spider web.

In the process of turning Japan into a springboard for aggression against the Far East, the US aggressors have always attached particular importance to Hokkaido, which is separated from the Soviet Union by only a strip of water. As early as the end of October 1951, when US Army Chief of Staff J. Lawton Collins came to the Far East for inspection, he inspected northern Japan with the then US Occupation Forces Commander-in-Chief Matthew Ridgway. Collins ordered Ridgway to turn Hokkaido into a major base. In August 1952, senior generals such as US Seventh Fleet Commander J. J. Clark, Far East Naval Commander Robert R. Briscoe, and First Cavalry Division Commander Arthur G. Trudeau held a series of meetings in Hokkaido to discuss the "defense" of northern Japan. Subsequently, US Ambassador to Japan Murphy also went to Hokkaido for "inspection."

Following this series of warmongering activities by the US military, the US military measures in Hokkaido have been intensified step by step.

Before the separate peace treaty, the US Occupation Forces had already established military bases throughout Hokkaido, centered on Sapporo and Chitose. Starting from Sapporo and connecting Toyohira, Hiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Tomakomai, Abira, and Betsu, a huge military base network has now been formed. In order to expand the military bases and barracks in Makomanai (in Sapporo) and Chitose, the US military used 10 billion yen of "occupation fees" scraped from the blood and sweat of the Japanese people to build large-scale military projects. Hokkaido also has the main US air force bases in Japan. The US has established large-scale airports in Misaki, Obihiro, Yagumo, Chitose, Bihoro, and Makomanai in Hokkaido, which can be used for jet aircraft to take off and land. In addition, military training grounds, radio stations, and radar stations are also spread throughout Hokkaido. According to the US-Japan military base agreement signed in July last year, there are as many as fifteen US military facilities in Hokkaido that the US military uses indefinitely, and seven that are used "temporarily." At the same time, not only are US troops stationed in Japan frequently stationed in Hokkaido with heavy troops, but under the instructions of the United States, the Yoshida government of Japan has also stationed the most elite division of "security forces" with heavy weapons equipment in Hokkaido to serve as "guards" for US military bases.

This frantic act of the US aggressors turning Hokkaido into an advanced base for aggression violates Japan's sovereignty and disrupts the lives of the people of Hokkaido. The US military arbitrarily purchases the land of Hokkaido farmers at extremely low prices for use as training grounds. According to incomplete statistics, the purchased land has reached 50,215 cho (each cho is equal to 14.87 acres). Because the army practices every day, crops are destroyed, fish ponds are completely abandoned, and most of the ports are occupied by the US military, the local people have no way to make a living. Hokkaido is originally rich in coal, but local residents have no coal to burn during the winter because almost all of the coal is transported to the Korean front lines, munitions factories, and military bases.

In order to protect their lives, the people of Hokkaido have launched a struggle against the US transformation of Hokkaido into a base of aggression. They oppose the US military occupying farmland and oppose US military exercises through go-slows and strikes, which greatly hinders US war plans. The Hokkaido peace movement is now even higher under the crazy war preparations policy of the United States. The Hokkaido Peace Protection Committee established the central organization of the Hokkaido Peace Movement in mid-December 1952 and is scheduled to convene a Hokkaido Peace Movement activists meeting in January of this year. In Otaru, Tokachi, Akabira Town, and Yubari, various forms of movements demanding peace and opposing war are being widely carried out. Workers, farmers, citizens, and small industrialists and businessmen have personally experienced the evil consequences of the US war policy and are actively participating in the peace movement, demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty, opposing the Yoshida government's conscription, and opposing serving as cannon fodder for the United States.

### 美国占领军在日本北海道大规模建筑军事基地  北海道各阶层人民一致反对美国战争政策

    美国占领军在日本北海道大规模建筑军事基地
    北海道各阶层人民一致反对美国战争政策
     【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：美国侵略者已把靠近苏联边境的北海道变成了美国在日本的主要军事基地之一，机场、兵营和演习场等像蜘蛛网一样遍布在整个北海道。
    美国侵略者在把日本变成向远东进行侵略的跳板的过程中，一向就特别重视和苏联只有一水之隔的北海道。早在一九五一年十月底，美国陆军参谋长杰·劳顿·柯林斯来远东视察时即曾和当时的美国驻日占领军总司令李奇微一同视察过日本的北部，柯林斯并命令李奇微把北海道变为一个主要基地。一九五二年八月，美国第七舰队司令杰·杰·克拉克、远东海军司令罗伯特·鲁·布里斯科、第一骑兵师师长阿瑟·格·特鲁迪安等高级将领在北海道举行了一连串的会议，商讨日本北部的“防务”问题。接着，美国驻日大使墨菲也到北海道去“视察”过。
    随着美国军方这一系列的好战活动，美国在北海道的军事措施也一步步加紧。
    在单独媾和以前，美国驻日占领军即以札幌、千岁为中心，在北海道遍设军事基地。从札幌起，贯连丰平、广岛、惠庭、千岁、苫小牧、安平、别门，现已形成一个庞大的军事基地网。为了扩大真驹内（在札幌）和千岁两地的军事基地和兵营，美军曾用搜刮日本人民血汗得来的一百亿日元“占领费”兴建大规模的军事工程。北海道也建有美国在日本的主要空军基地。美国在北海道的三埼、带广、八云、千岁、美幌和真驹内建立了大规模的飞机场，可以供喷气式飞机升降。此外，军事演习场、电台和雷达站也布满了北海道。根据去年七月签订的美日军事基地协定，美军无限期使用的北海道军事设施达十五处之多，“临时使用”的也有七处。同时，不但驻日美军经常以重兵屯驻北海道，在美国的指示下，日本吉田政府也把拥有重武器装备的最精锐的一师“保安队”驻扎在北海道，担任美国军事基地的“警卫”。
    美国侵略者这种疯狂地把北海道变为侵略前哨基地的行为侵犯了日本的主权，破坏了北海道人民的生活。美军以极低的代价任意征购北海道农民的土地做演习场，据不完全的统计，被征购的土地已达五万二百一十五町步（每町步合十四·八七市亩）。由于军队每天演习，农作物被破坏，鱼池全部荒废，大部分港湾被美军占用，当地人民无以为生。北海道本来盛产煤炭，但是当地居民过冬时却没有煤烧，因为煤差不多全部被运到朝鲜前线、军需工厂和军事基地去了。
    北海道的人民为了保卫自己的生活，展开了反对美国变北海道为侵略基地的斗争。他们以怠工、罢工等方式反对美军霸占农田，反对美军演习，使美国的战争计划受到很大的阻碍。北海道的保卫和平运动现在已在美国疯狂备战的政策之下更为高涨。北海道拥护和平委员会已于一九五二年十二月中旬成立全北海道和平运动的中心组织，并定于今年一月召开全北海道和平运动活动分子会议。在小樽、十胜、赤平町和夕张等地，各种形式的要求和平、反对战争的运动正普遍展开。工人、农民、市民、小工商业者切身体验到美国战争政策的恶果，都积极参加和平运动，要求缔结五大国和平公约，反对吉田政府征兵，反对替美国当炮灰。
