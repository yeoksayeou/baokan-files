I Want to Be a Geological Engineer for the Future of the Motherland
Student of Beijing Institute of Geology, Lu Shumin

How excited I was when I learned that I had been admitted to the Beijing Institute of Geology! As soon as I entered the school gate, I saw the large slogan "Welcome Future Geological Engineers of the Motherland!" After completing the enrollment procedures at the registration office, the comrade in charge asked, "Will you be eating at the school this afternoon? If so, we'll prepare a meal for you." When moving to the dormitory, someone enthusiastically helped me. How could all this not make me feel warm? And how could it not make me love this school?

Soon after arriving at the school, the older students busily arranged an exhibition for us. As soon as I entered the exhibition hall, I saw minerals of various colors on the display tables. This made me deeply feel the infinite richness of our motherland. For thousands of years, our ancestors lived on this vast land, constantly fighting against nature. They extensively used copper and iron; as early as the Eastern Han Dynasty, they knew that petroleum was called "ancient lacquer." The exhibition also told me that the Chinese people had discovered various minerals in many places after liberation.

When the teachers lectured us on "crystallization" in class, they often mentioned minerals belonging to this crystal class. Pointing to the beautiful mineral graphics, they said, "We can proudly say that our motherland has all these minerals!" Upon hearing this, the students' faces lit up with smiles. These smiles expressed: We cannot let these minerals remain buried underground forever; we must excavate them as soon as possible and use them to benefit society.

The school has prepared practice rooms for us. We can often sit here to observe each rock and recognize what granite is and what marble is. When we drop hydrochloric acid on the rock and the rock bubbles, everyone knows that this is a rock containing calcium sulfate. But rocks are composed of many kinds of minerals, and recognizing them is indeed a difficult task; especially in the field, it is even more difficult to recognize them. If we don't work hard to familiarize ourselves with them in the laboratory today, how will we be able to recognize them in the future?

The motherland's expectations of us are so earnest; she requires us to learn science and technology and serve the people. This is an arduous task, and we must use the greatest courage and strength to overcome all the difficulties in learning. Today, the people only allow us to learn well and do not allow us to not learn well. The country has prepared good learning conditions for us, so what reason do I have to fail the expectations of the people? I cannot avoid this arduous task; I will unreservedly contribute my strength to the geological cause of the motherland!

    我要做一个祖国未来的地质工程师
    北京地质学院学生  鲁淑敏
    当我知道我已考取了北京地质学院时，我是多么兴奋啊！我一进校门便看到了“欢迎祖国未来的地质工程师！”的大字标语。到报到处办完入学手续，负责同志便问：“下午在学校吃饭吗？要吃的话就给你准备。”搬往宿舍去的时候，有人热情地帮助我。这一切怎么能不使我感到温暖呢？又怎么能不使我热爱这所学校呢？
    到校后不久，老同学忙着为我们布置了一个展览会。我一走进展览室，就在陈列桌上看到了各色的矿物。这使我深深地感到我们祖国无限富饶。我们的祖先几千年来在这辽阔的土地上生活着，不断地和自然搏斗。他们曾广泛地利用铜、铁；远在东汉时代就已知道石油叫“古漆”。展览会还告诉我，中国人民在解放后曾在不少地方发现了各种矿产。
    老师在课堂上给我们讲“结晶”时，常常提到属于这晶类的矿石。他们指着很好看的矿石图形说：“我们可以骄傲地说，这些矿物我们祖国都有！”同学们听了，脸上都露出了笑容。这笑容表示着：我们不能让这些矿物永远埋藏在地下，我们必须尽快地去发掘它们，利用它们为社会谋福利。
    学校里为我们准备了实习室。我们可以经常坐在这里观察每块岩石，认识什么是花岗岩，什么是大理岩。当我们把盐酸滴在岩石上，岩石发生气泡的时候，大家就知道这是含有硫酸钙的岩石。但岩石是由很多种矿物构成的，要认识它们确实是一件困难的事情；特别是在野外，要认识它们更是困难，如果今天在实验室里不下工夫熟习它们，那么将来又怎么能够认识它们呢？
    祖国对我们的期望是那样的殷切，她要求我们学会科学技术，为人民服务。这是一个艰巨的任务，我们必须拿最大的勇气和力量，来克服学习中的一切困难。今天人民只允许我们学好，不允许我们学不好。国家为我们准备了良好的学习条件，我有什么理由辜负人民的期望呢？我不能躲避这一艰巨的任务，我将毫无保留地把我的力量贡献给祖国的地质事业！
