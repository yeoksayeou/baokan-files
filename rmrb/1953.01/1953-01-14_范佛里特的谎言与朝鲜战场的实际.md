Van Fleet's Lies and the Reality of the Korean Battlefield
    The American magazine "This Week" published an article about the Korean War by General Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea. In his article, Van Fleet lavishes praise on the vassal states and tries his best to portray the relationship between the countries participating in the invasion of Korea as harmonious and seamless.
    However, the actual situation on the Korean battlefield shatters Van Fleet's shameless lies. Although the American ruling clique has issued urgent appeals for their aggressive partners to send the cannon fodder they had promised, the number of troops supplied by Western European countries is getting smaller and smaller.

    范佛里特的谎言与朝鲜战场的实际
    美国“这一周”杂志刊载了美国驻朝鲜第八军军长范佛里特的一篇关于朝鲜战争的文章。范佛里特在他的文章中对附庸国家滥加赞扬，竭力把参加侵略朝鲜的各国之间的关系描写为融洽无间。
    然而朝鲜战场的实际情况，粉碎了范佛里特的无耻谎言。虽然美国统治集团发出紧急呼吁要求他们的侵略伙伴派遣已经答应了的炮灰，但是西欧各国所供的军队却是愈来愈少了。
