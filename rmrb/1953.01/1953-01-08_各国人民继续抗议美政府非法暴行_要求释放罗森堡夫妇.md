Xinhua News Agency, 7th. People of various countries continue to protest against the U.S. judicial authorities' conspiracy to murder Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

    On January 5th, the U.S. National Committee for Fair Trial in the Rosenberg Case organized a mass protest demonstration near the White House, attended by thousands, demanding that U.S. President Truman order the cancellation of the Rosenbergs' sentences. The demonstrators expressed their determination to fight to the end for a fair trial.

    This so-called "spy" case, fabricated single-handedly by the U.S. judicial authorities, fully exposes the hideous features of the U.S. reactionaries' determination to persecute peace-loving people. New York Federal Judge Irving Kaufman could not produce any evidence during the trial to prove the so-called "espionage crimes" falsely accused against the Rosenbergs, but he stubbornly insisted on maintaining the original death sentence. On January 2nd, he once again refused to retry the case. But he inadvertently revealed that the whole case was a political persecution. He said that the "crime," which he called "worse than murder," was a "crime of thought and belief." This is an admission that the U.S. judicial and intelligence authorities fabricated this so-called "espionage case" simply because the two innocent defendants supported peace and opposed the war policies of U.S. imperialism.

    This barbaric crime of the U.S. judicial authorities has been met with angry protests from upright people in various countries around the world. In the German Democratic Republic, women in Düsseldorf held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate, demanding the release of the Rosenbergs. The Association of Victims of Nazi Persecution wrote to the U.S. Supreme Court, demanding that the death sentence be revoked. The working people of Romania have also protested against the illegal atrocities of the U.S. judicial authorities, demanding the restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom. A committee to rescue the Rosenbergs has been established in Canada, demanding the release of these two innocent victims. In Japan, the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the National Relief Association, the Korean Liberation Relief Association, the Democratic Women's Association, and the National Committee of the Youth Homeland Front sent a letter to Truman through U.S. Ambassador to Japan Murphy, demanding the release of the Rosenbergs.

    各国人民继续抗议美政府非法暴行
    要求释放罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社七日讯】各国人民继续抗议美国司法当局阴谋杀害朱利叶斯·罗森堡夫妇。
    一月五日，美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会在白宫附近组织了上千人参加的群众抗议示威，要求美国总统杜鲁门下令取消对罗森堡夫妇的判刑。示威者表示他们决心为争取公正裁决斗争到最后。
    美国司法当局所一手捏造的这个所谓“间谍”案件，充分暴露了美国反动派执意残害和平人民的狰狞面貌。纽约联邦法官欧温·考夫曼在审讯中拿不出任何证据来证明诬告罗森堡夫妇的所谓“间谍罪行”，却蛮横地一直坚持维持死刑原判。一月二日他再一次拒绝重审这个案件。但他无意中却说出了整个案件是一次政治迫害。他说他称之为“甚于谋杀”的“犯罪”是“思想与信仰上的罪行”。这就是承认了美国司法和特务当局制造这个所谓“间谍案”，只是因为这两个无辜被告拥护和平、反对美国帝国主义的战争政策。
    美国司法当局这一野蛮罪行已经遭到世界各国正直人士的愤怒抗议。在德意志民主共和国，杜塞尔多夫的妇女曾在美国领事馆门前举行示威游行，要求释放罗森堡夫妇。受纳粹迫害者协会曾写信给美国最高法院，要求撤销死刑判决。罗马尼亚的劳动人民也纷纷抗议美国司法当局的非法暴行，要求恢复罗森堡夫妇自由。加拿大成立了一个营救罗森堡夫妇的委员会，要求释放这两个无辜受害者。在日本，全日本产业别工会会议、国民救援会、朝鲜解放救援会、民主妇女协议会及青年祖国战线全国委员会曾通过美国驻日大使墨菲向杜鲁门送去一份要求释放罗森堡夫妇书。
