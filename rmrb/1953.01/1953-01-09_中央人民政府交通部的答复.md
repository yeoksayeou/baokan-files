Reply from the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government

To the Readers' Letters Group of the People's Daily:

    The suggestion made by Comrade Li Xiaohai regarding the prohibition of dumping coal ash into the Yangtze River is very valuable. After receiving the letter you forwarded, we studied the matter together with Soviet experts and believe that Comrade Li Xiaohai's opinion of not dumping coal ash in shallow waterways and port areas is completely correct. We will notify the Yangtze River Navigation Administration to inform all ships traveling the Yangtze River to pay close attention to this matter in the future. As for dumping coal ash in deep water areas outside the port area, it is currently not an issue due to the high flow rate of the river.

    中央人民政府交通部的答复
    人民日报社读者来信组：李孝海同志提出的关于禁止在长江倾倒煤灰的建议是很有价值的。接到你们转来的来信后，我们和苏联专家共同研究了这个问题，认为李孝海同志提出不要在浅水航道和港区以内倾倒煤灰的意见是完全正确的。我们将通知长江航务局转告所有行驶长江的轮船，今后严加注意。至于在港区以外水深处，因为江水的流速大，倾倒煤灰尚无妨碍。  中央人民政府交通部
