Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: American newspapers are clamorously publishing news about bombing and strafing the Kaesong-Pyongyang highway to "stop supplies from being transported to the front line," the purpose of which is to cover up the fact that the US side unilaterally tore up the agreement that representative delegation convoys would not be attacked in order to prepare for expanding the Korean War. This is the opinion of observers here. They pointed out that another purpose of this clamor is to prevent the public from knowing about the complete failure of the US Air Force in cutting off the transportation and supplies of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The firepower and combat strength of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on all fronts have been strengthened.

As early as last October, observers here had already noticed the so-called talks by spokesmen of the US Eighth Army and Air Force that Kaesong was a supply center for the western front, and believed that this was a smokescreen for tearing up the remaining agreements related to the armistice negotiations. This has now been confirmed by the US side's unilateral tearing up of the agreement that representative delegation convoys would not be attacked. A recent dispatch from Seoul by the Associated Press said, "Allied commanders suspect that Kaesong is currently being used as a war supply storage center." This shows that Washington is pursuing its step-by-step plan: creating excuses to tear up the agreements related to the existence of the Panmunjom meeting area and the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and destroying the last bit of what remains of the interrupted negotiations. The aforementioned Associated Press dispatch also hinted at this purpose, saying: "Allied commanders do not understand why supplies are still being transported to" the North Korean and Chinese delegations in Kaesong, "because there is no sign that any armistice conference will be held there now."

Obviously, the US Air Force is continuing to pursue the policy of giving distorted news to the press, which was the policy pursued by former press officer Nacos in Panmunjom. Everyone knows that the US Air Force has exhausted all means in the past two years to try to cut off the transportation and supplies of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, but the result has been a failure. Van Fleet himself admitted this. Since the start of the armistice negotiations, the Kaesong-Pyongyang highway has been constantly subjected to frenzied bombing by the US side, but this atrocity cannot save the defeat of the US ground forces on the western front. The greatest defeat suffered by the US military in 1952 clearly depicts the complete failure of the US Air Force in preventing supplies from being transported to the front line, when the US military lost more than 25,000 people in just forty-six days in a three-square-kilometer area in the central sector.

Observers pointed out that the US side's unilateral tearing up of the agreement that representative delegation convoys would not be attacked is a signal that Eisenhower is preparing to expand the war, but the US side's provocative actions will by no means save the US military from suffering even more disastrous defeats on all fronts.

### 美方撕毁代表团车队不受攻击的协议决不能挽救美军遭受更惨重的失败

    美方撕毁代表团车队不受攻击的协议决不能挽救美军遭受更惨重的失败
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道：美国报纸吵吵嚷嚷地登载关于轰炸和扫射开城—平壤公路以“阻止供应品运赴前线”的消息，其目的是要掩饰这样一个事实，这就是美方为了作好扩大朝鲜战争的准备而片面撕毁了代表团车队不受攻击的协议。这是此间观察家的意见。他们指出，这种吵吵嚷嚷的另一个目的，是要想不让公众知道美国空军在切断朝中人民军队的交通和供应方面的完全失败。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在各战线上的火力和战斗力量都加强了。
    早在去年十月，此间观察家就已注意到美国第八军和空军的发言人的所谓开城是对西线的一个供应中心的谈话，认为这是一种要撕毁与停战谈判有关的剩下的协议的烟幕。这一点现在已由美方片面撕毁代表团车队不受攻击的协议得到证实了。合众社最近从汉城发出的一则电讯说，“联军司令官们怀疑开城目前正在被当作一个战争供应品贮藏中心。”这表明华盛顿正在推行它的有步骤的计划：制造借口来撕毁与板门店会场区和开城中立区的存在有关的协议，并摧毁已告中断的谈判最后剩下的一点东西。上述合众社电讯也暗示了这种目的，电讯说：“联军司令官们不明白为什么供应品还在运给”开城的朝中代表团，“因为现在看不到将有任何停战会议要在该地举行”。
    显然美国空军是在继续奉行把歪曲的消息交给报界发表的政策，这种政策就是前新闻发布官纳科斯在板门店所奉行的。大家都知道，美国空军过去两年来曾用尽了各种方法要想切断朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的交通和供应，但是结果失败了。范佛里特本人也承认了这点。自从停战谈判开始以来，开城—平壤公路经常遭受美方的狂轰滥炸，但是这种暴行并不能挽救美方地面部队在西线的溃败。美军在一九五二年所遭受的最大溃败，显明地刻划出美国空军在阻止供应品运赴前线方面的完全失败，当时美军仅在中线的三平方公里地区四十六天内就损失了二万五千多人。
    观察家们指出：美方片面撕毁代表团车队不受攻击的协议，是艾森豪威尔准备扩大战争的信号，但是美方的挑衅行动决不能挽救美军在各战线上遭受更惨重的失败。
