    Yoshida Government Prepares to Establish Espionage Agency
    To Spy on Japanese Democratic Groups and Information from Various Democratic Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 9th: The Yoshida government's plan to revive Japanese militarism by restoring the wartime Cabinet Intelligence Bureau has been drafted by Deputy Prime Minister and State Minister, Takeo Ogata, the former president of the Koiso Cabinet Intelligence Bureau. It has been decided to allocate a huge sum of 11 billion yen in the 1953 budget specifically for this intelligence agency.
    News from senior officials of the Yoshida government obtained by Kyodo News and various Japanese newspapers proves that this soon-to-be-established Cabinet intelligence agency is a thorough and complete espionage organization. According to Kyodo News, this intelligence agency consists of four departments with the intelligence department as its core. Its main tasks are: to spy on information from various democratic groups in Japan and democratic countries around the world, and to send spies to operate abroad. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the main task of this intelligence agency is espionage. The "Tokyo Shimbun" stated that its function will be "exactly the same" as the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Japanese newspapers also emphasized that "Communist countries and the Communist Information Bureau are the sole targets of this espionage department."
    The personnel of this espionage agency will mainly be selected from former Japanese fascist army and navy soldiers. The Yoshida government has obtained the support of the U.S. Embassy in Japan, and the United States will assist Japan in terms of equipment and technology.
    Since announcing its intention to restore the wartime Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, the Yoshida government has been widely opposed by the Japanese people and has taken into account the reactions abroad, mainly from Southeast Asian countries. It has decided that this espionage agency will not be established as an independent agency in name, but will be concealed within the existing Cabinet "Investigation Office," expanding and strengthening the Cabinet "Investigation Office."

    吉田政府准备设立特务机关
    刺探日本民主团体和各民主国家情报
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：吉田政府为了复活日本军国主义而恢复战时内阁情报局的计划，已由副首相兼国务相、前小矶内阁情报局总裁绪方竹虎草拟完成，并决定在一九五三年度预算中拨出一百一十亿日元的巨款专供这个情报机关使用。
    共同社与日本各报从吉田政府高级官员得来的消息证明：这个即将成立的内阁情报机关是一个彻头彻尾的特务机构。据共同社报道，这个情报机关由以谍报部为中心的四个部门组成，主要的任务是：刺探日本各民主团体和世界各民主国家的情报，并将派遣间谍往国外活动。“朝日新闻”说：这个情报机关的主要任务是间谍工作。“东京新闻”说：它的职能将和美国的中央情报局“完全一样”。日本各报并强调指出，“共产党国家和共产党情报局是该间谍部门的唯一目标。”
    这个特务机关的人员主要将由前日本法西斯陆、海军军人中选拔。吉田政府已取得美国驻日大使馆的支持，美国将在设备和技术方面帮助日本。
    吉田政府由于自宣布恢复战时内阁情报局的企图之后已受到日本人民普遍的反对，并顾及国外主要是东南亚各国的反响，决定这个特务机关在名义上不成立一个独立的机关，而将它隐蔽在现有的内阁“调查室”内，把内阁“调查室”扩大和加强。
