    Beijing Authorities Take Measures to Stop Certain Construction Units from Indiscriminately Recruiting Workers
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Relevant departments in Beijing have taken effective measures to correct the tendency of certain construction units to indiscriminately recruit workers at the end of last year, disregarding the overall situation.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, the Labor Bureau, and other units held a special meeting to study the issue and adopted effective measures to correct the chaotic phenomenon of construction departments indiscriminately recruiting workers: 1. All basic construction units in Beijing should immediately stop indiscriminately recruiting construction workers; and conduct a general inspection. Those who have indiscriminately recruited workers from other units should send the recruited workers back to their original units. 2. Units whose basic construction tasks have been determined may, upon approval by their leading organs based on their needs, submit the required number of workers to the Beijing Municipal People's Government for unified allocation. The principle of allocation is: to recruit workers uniformly in Beijing as much as possible. If the needs are still not met, a request should be submitted to the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government to introduce and recruit a portion of workers from other areas. 3. The Beijing Municipal People's Government People's Supervisory Committee, the Financial and Economic Committee, the Labor Bureau, and other units will jointly form an inspection team to conduct further investigations in units with more serious cases of indiscriminately recruiting workers, in order to handle them correctly. 4. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and more than 20 major construction units have formed an office for adjusting wages, with three groups for technical standards, wage standard grade systems, and welfare, to propose measures around January 20th to unify the city's construction industry wage system and roughly unify welfare benefits, so as to ensure the smooth progress of basic construction work.

    北京市有关部门采取措施
    制止某些建筑单位乱拉工人
    据新华社讯：北京市各有关部门采取有效的措施，纠正去年年底某些建筑单位不顾全局乱拉工人的偏向。
    北京市人民政府财政经济委员会、劳动局等单位曾专门开会研究，并采取了有效办法，纠正建筑部门乱拉工人中的混乱现象：一、所有在北京的各基本建设单位，立即停止乱招建筑工人；并普遍进行一次检查，凡乱拉其他单位工人者，应将拉来的工人送回原单位。二、凡是基本建设任务已经确定的单位，可根据需要经其领导机关批准后，提出需工数字，报请北京市人民政府统筹解决。解决的原则是：尽量在北京统一招收，如果实在不敷需要，再报请中央人民政府劳动部介绍到外埠招收一部分工人。三、由北京市人民政府人民监察委员会、财政经济委员会、劳动局等单位共同组成检查组，到乱拉工人较严重的单位作进一步调查，以求得正确处理。四、北京市人民政府劳动局、北京市总工会及二十多个主要建筑单位，组成调整工资工作办公室，下设技术标准、工资标准等级制度和福利三组，在一月二十日左右提出办法，以求统一全市建筑业工资制度和大体上统一福利待遇，保证基本建设工作顺利进行。
