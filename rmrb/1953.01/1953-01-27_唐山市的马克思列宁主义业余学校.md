    An Overview of Tangshan City's Marxist-Leninist Amateur School
    Since July 1952, the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee established a Marxist-Leninist amateur school, adopting a formal approach to schooling, so that cadres in the city with a junior high school education or above can regularly receive systematic theoretical education.
    The whole school has a total of 5,141 students. 696 people are participating in the intermediate group, who are veteran cadres at the county committee level and general cadres with a certain level of political theory. 4,445 people are participating in the primary group, most of whom are new cadres who joined the workforce after liberation. The city has a total of 14 branch schools. The curriculum, study time, and various study systems of the branch schools are all uniformly stipulated by the main school. The amateur school adopts a learning method that focuses on large lectures and is supplemented by self-study. The primary class is divided into four school districts according to residential areas, and lectures are given by four full-time teachers. The intermediate class is concentrated in one school district, and lectures are given by a theoretical advisory group organized by the Municipal Party Committee. Factories, mines, and government offices have a total of 45 part-time theory teachers and 218 instructors.
    The Superiority of the Amateur School
    The adoption of the amateur school format to organize cadres' theoretical study in Tangshan City is more organized and planned than other organizational forms of cadres' political theory study in the past.
    From 1949 to 1950, the theoretical study of cadres in Tangshan was led by the Study Committee. The Study Committee, composed of heads of various agencies, played a positive role in uniting cadres inside and outside the Party and mobilizing everyone to study. However, as most of the heads of the agencies did not bear actual work responsibilities, it exposed serious weaknesses such as loose organization, no one in charge, and inability to solve problems as the study developed in depth. Since 1951, in accordance with the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, it was changed to be led by the Party committees of various agencies, which was an important improvement. However, many branch committee members were part-time and could not bear the regular work of leading the study. Some branch education committee members had a low level of education and did not participate in theoretical study themselves, so it was also difficult to lead the theoretical study of cadres well. Three years of experience have proven that it is difficult to do a good job in the theoretical study of cadres without a certain professional organization.
    At the same time, over the past three years, the content of study has changed too much. Often, before one course is completed, another course begins. The main method of study relies on group discussions, lacking regular reports and guidance. Therefore, the level of study cannot be improved, and cadres feel a lack of confidence in their studies.
    After the establishment of the Tangshan City Marxist-Leninist Amateur School, it solved many problems in the theoretical study of cadres that could not be solved in the past. The main ones are:
    First, there is a set of formal teaching systems, including lectures by full-time teachers, guidance by study instructors, classroom discussions, and problem solving. This overcomes the difficulties in the past due to the lack of specialized guidance, which made it difficult to delve into documents and impossible to answer questions.
    Second, various formal systems have been established. First of all, the general school of the amateur school uniformly stipulates the time for theoretical study of cadres in the city, and the Municipal Party Committee makes a decision to notify all agencies that study time shall not be encroached upon without the approval of the Municipal Party Committee. During the study process, Party committees at all levels fought against the phenomenon of encroaching on study time, which overcame the shortcomings of the past where work was busy and study was squeezed out. Secondly, cadres can participate in different classes of study according to their different levels, and gradually improve step by step. Finally, the establishment of various formal systems (such as reporting systems, attendance systems, study summary systems, etc.) has guaranteed the further regularization and frequent nature of theoretical study.
    Third, the school is led by the Party committee, and daily work is managed by full-time cadres. In this way, all measures of the school can obtain the strong support of Party committees at all levels. On the other hand, specific administrative work is handled by full-time cadres, overcoming the phenomenon of no one being responsible.
    Fourth, it has driven the study of small-unit agencies and some economic enterprise departments, making the theoretical study of cadres in the city tend towards balanced development. In the past, due to difficult study conditions and the inability of the municipal leadership to provide universal care, the study of many small agencies was in a state of laissez-faire for a long time. The factory and mine financial systems often had abnormal study due to the heavy burden of production and business. After the establishment of the amateur school, it began to overcome the above difficulties and shortcomings.
    Several Key Links in Running the School Well
    The experience of the Tangshan City Marxist-Leninist Amateur School proves that to run such a school well, the following links must be grasped.
    First, the Party committee's emphasis on the allocation of theoretical teachers and the establishment of professional institutions in the school is the key to ensuring that the school can persist. The Tangshan Municipal Party Committee selected appropriate cadres to study at the Hebei Provincial Party Committee's Party History Teacher Training Class, which solved the difficulty of party history theory teachers in the Tangshan City Amateur School. At the same time, setting up professional institutions for amateur schools from top to bottom in accordance with the Party committee system quickly built up the framework. The city has a general amateur school, with the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and the Minister of Propaganda serving as the President and Vice President respectively. The general school has a teaching affairs office, under which are the teaching and research section and the secretary's office, which are specifically responsible for the city's teaching leadership and administrative organization work. All decisions and measures of the school are completely concentrated and unified in the general school. Under the general school, each factory, mine and agency has 14 branch schools, with the Party Committee Secretary and the Minister of Propaganda serving as the President and Vice President. Each branch school has one or two full-time staff members who are regularly responsible for convening meetings, distributing documents, mastering systems, and compiling statistics, etc. The characteristics of theoretical study by on-the-job cadres are amateurism, mobility and dispersion, which are difficult to manage and master. In addition, there are many specific matters in the school's organizational work (such as grade assignment, attendance, document receipt and distribution, statistical data, etc.), which cannot be handled by a few part-time cadres. With such a professional organization, the daily work of the school can proceed normally.
    Second, ensuring the quality of teaching is the second important link in running an amateur school well. The Tangshan Municipal Party Committee has done a lot of work to improve the quality of lectures by theoretical teachers. First of all, in order to strengthen the school's teaching guidance work, the general school of the amateur school established a teaching and research section. Under the personal leadership of the Minister of Propaganda and the Director of Education, the teaching and research section discussed and formulated a learning plan for each learning unit (including learning objectives, progress, and learning methods, etc.). At the same time, it formulated lecturing outlines and unified lecture notes as the basis for lectures by all teachers in the school. In this way, the correctness and consistency of the content of lectures by all teachers in the school are guaranteed. Secondly, in order to ensure that the theoretical consultants can regularly lecture to the intermediate class, the general school helped them in three ways: 1. Solve the time problem of theoretical consultants. Since the theoretical consultants are all responsible comrades who are very busy with work, they are only required to lecture one unit each, averaging once every six months, so as not to make the burden too heavy, and they are notified more than a month before lecturing. 2. The teaching and research section of the general school fully provides them with lecturing materials. 3. The secretary's office of the general school introduces the students' ideological situation, the issues of debate, and feedback on the lecturing effect, etc., to strengthen the connection between their lectures and practice. Thirdly, in addition to organizing the teachers who lecture to the primary class in the teaching and research section for collective research and collective lesson preparation, they are also organized to listen to lectures in the intermediate class and observe each other, and regularly summarize experience to improve the lecturing effect. Finally, help teachers answer questions. Before the end of each learning unit, each branch school reported to the general school the various cognitive problems exposed by the students. The teaching and research section carefully studied and made answers, and after being reviewed and approved by the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the original lecturers separately conducted the answers. The general amateur school has answered a total of 42 kinds of questions of various sizes. After the questions were answered, the students' thinking was generally improved, so each question-answering session was warmly welcomed by the cadres. This is a very important step in improving the teaching effect.
    Third, strengthen the guidance work. The task of the instructors is to deepen the cadres' understanding of the course through the stages of previewing, reviewing, discussing, and summarizing each learning unit. In the preview, the instructors explain the main points of the documents to the students, making it easier for them to accept the content of the lectures and preventing aimless reading without a center. In the review, the instructors guide everyone to study the key points, strengthen the effect of self-study by checking notes, casually talking about the spirit of the lectures, and pointing out reference documents. Group discussions and classroom discussions are important processes for digesting the content of lectures. Group discussions are casual talks based on the topics issued by the school. Based on the group discussion situation, the instructors and the school jointly formulate classroom discussion topics, and then the instructors initially draw up a list of speakers for classroom discussion from students with different ideological understandings, and cultivate typical speeches. During the classroom discussion, the instructors should promptly raise questions, clarify the direction, and prevent laissez-faire. When the discussion of the questions reaches a certain level, the instructors can make a simple conclusion. Finally, in the summary, the instructors should help the students analyze the gains, criticize incorrect learning attitudes, and consolidate learning results.
    In order for the instructors to be able to do the above work well, the guidance and specific assistance of Party committees at all levels must be strengthened. For example, before the start of each learning unit, each branch school holds an instructor meeting (part-time theory teachers also participate) to arrange the key points and requirements of the study; before the classroom discussion, each branch school also holds the same meeting to discuss the classroom discussion topics and make preliminary conclusions; finally, at the end of each learning unit, the branch school convenes the instructors to report on the study situation and summarize the experience of the guidance work. This is very helpful for the improvement of the instructors.
    Fourth, correct the attitude towards learning. Before the opening of the amateur school, cadres had various erroneous views and requirements for Party history study. Some veteran cadres believed that they already knew the content of Party history, therefore, they requested "less talk about historical facts and more talk about viewpoints," while some new cadres held a curious attitude and made the opposite request. At the opening of the school, Party committees at all levels conducted in-depth ideological mobilization for learning, explained the learning policy, and criticized various incorrect learning attitudes, laying the ideological foundation for the normal learning of cadres. In the learning process, Party committees at all levels regularly conduct inspections and supervision. Some units' branches stipulated that Party members must report on their learning situation on Party Day, which provided a strong guarantee for the cadres' learning. At the end of each learning unit, learning summaries were also used to check the learning ideology. These works have played a great role in correcting the attitude towards learning and improving learning methods.

        Problems that Exist
    There are still two problems in the work of the Tangshan City Amateur School:
    First, in terms of teachers, the city's part-time teachers have not actually played a role. Although full-time teachers are relatively well-prepared, their lecturing level cannot be quickly improved in general due to their lack of work experience. Therefore, full-time teachers and part-time teachers must be combined, each performing their duties, and the role of theory teachers must be fully utilized to improve the quality of teaching, and conditions must be prepared to reduce the number of students in each class to strengthen the teaching effect.
    Second, the instructors study with everyone at ordinary times and lack time for specialized research. The instructors are all students of the same level, and their levels are not far apart. If they are not improved, they will not be able to persist in the guidance work.
    The above two problems need to be solved well.

    唐山市的马克思列宁主义业余学校
    概况
    唐山市委从一九五二年七月起建立了马克思列宁主义业余学校，采取正规化的办学方针，使全市初中文化程度以上的干部能经常受到系统的理论教育。
    全校共有学员五一四一名，参加中级组学习的六九六人，是县委级老干部和具有一定政治理论水平的一般干部，参加初级组学习的四四四五人，大部是解放后参加工作的新干部。全市共设有十四所分校，分校的课程、学习时间和各种学习制度，都由总校统一规定。业余学校采取上大课为主自学为辅的学习方法。初级班按住区分成四个学区上课，由四名专职教员讲课。中级班集中一个学区上课，由市委组成的理论顾问团讲课。各厂矿机关共设有四十五名兼职理论教员，二一八名辅导员。
    业余学校的优越性
    唐山市采取业余学校形式来组织干部理论学习，较之过去干部政治理论学习的其他组织形式，更有组织性和计划性。
    在一九四九年到一九五○年期间，唐山干部理论学习是由学委会领导的。学委会是由各机关负责人组成，它在团结党内外干部与动员号召大家学习上，曾起了积极的作用。但由于各机关负责人大半未负担起实际工作责任，因此在学习深入发展后，它就暴露出了组织松弛、无人负责、不能解决问题的严重弱点。从一九五一年起，遵照河北省委指示，改由各机关党委来领导学习，这是一个重要的改进。但许多支部委员都是兼职，不能负担领导学习的经常工作。有些支部教育委员文化水平很低，自己不参加理论学习，因此也很难把干部理论学习领导好。三年来的经验证明，没有一定的专业机构，要把干部理论学习工作做好是很难的。
    同时，三年以来，学习内容变换太多，往往一种课程没有学完，又开始学习别的课程了。学习方法主要靠小组讨论，缺少经常的报告和辅导。因此，学习水平提不高，干部对学习感到没有信心。
    唐山市马克思列宁主义业余学校成立后，解决了过去干部理论学习中许多不能解决的问题。其中主要的是：
    第一、有专职教员讲课，学习辅导员辅导，课堂讨论，问题解答等一套正规教学制度，这样就克服了过去由于缺乏专人指导，因而文件钻不进、问题无法解答的困难。
    第二、建立了各种正规制度。首先，业余学校的总校统一规定了全市干部理论学习的时间，并由市委做出决定，通知一切机关，未经市委批准，不得侵占学习时间。在学习进行中，各级党委又向侵占学习时间的现象进行了斗争，这就克服了过去工作忙就挤垮了学习的缺点。其次，干部可以根据不同的水平参加不同的班次学习，循序渐进，逐步提高。最后，各种正规制度的设立（如汇报制度、考勤制度、学习总结制度等等），又保证了理论学习的进一步正规化和经常化。
    第三、学校由党委负责领导，日常工作设立专职干部管理。这样，学校的一切措施，都能获得各级党委的有力支持。在另一方面，具体的行政工作又有专职干部担任，克服了无人负责的现象。
    第四、带动了小单位机关与某些经济企业部门的学习，使全市干部理论学习，趋向于平衡的发展。在过去，由于学习条件困难，市级领导无力普遍照顾，许多小机关的学习长期陷于自流状态。厂矿财务系统，常因生产业务的繁重，学习也不正常。业余学校成立后，就开始克服了上述困难和缺点。
    办好学校的几个环节
    唐山市马克思列宁主义业余学校的经验证明，办好这样的学校，必须抓住如下的环节。
    第一、党委重视理论教员的配置与学校专业机构的设立，是使学校能够坚持下去的关键。唐山市委选拔适当的干部到河北省委党史教员训练班去学习，解决了唐山市业余学校党史理论教员的困难。同时按照党委系统从上而下地来设立业余学校的专业机构，就很快的把架子搭了起来，全市设有业余总校，由市委书记与宣传部长分任正副校长。总校设有教务处，下辖教研室与秘书室，专门负责全市教学领导与行政组织工作，全校一切决定和措施，完全集中统一于总校。在总校之下，各厂矿机关分设十四处分校，由各党委书记与宣传部长任正副校长。分校设专职干事一人至二人，经常负责召集会议、分发文件、掌握制度、统计数字等具体工作。在职干部理论学习的特点是业余、流动和分散，很难管理和掌握。再加上学校组织工作中有许多具体事务（如编级，考勤，收发文件，统计数字等），不是少数兼职干部所能胜任。有了这样一套专业的机构，才能使学校的日常工作正常进行。
    第二、保证教学质量，是办好业余学校的第二个重要环节。唐山市委在提高理论教员讲课质量方面，曾经作了不少工作。首先，为了加强学校的教学指导工作，业余总校成立了教研室。教研室在宣传部长和教育科长亲自主持下，讨论拟制每一学习单元的学习计划（包括学习目的、进度、以及学习方法等）。同时，拟制讲授提纲与统一讲稿，作为全校教员讲课的依据。这样，就保证了全校教员讲课内容的正确性与一致性。其次，为了保证理论顾问能经常对中级班讲课，总校又从三方面来帮助了他们：一、解决理论顾问的时间问题。由于理论顾问都是工作很忙的负责同志，因此只要求他们每人讲一个单元，平均半年讲课一次，不使负担过重，并且都在讲课前一个多月即通知了他们。二、总校教研室充分供给他们讲课资料。三、总校秘书处向教员介绍学员思想情况，争论的问题和讲课效果反映等等，加强了他们讲课与实际的联系。其三，对初级班讲课的教员，除把他们组织在教研室内集体研究与集体备课外，还组织他们听中级班讲课和互相观摩，经常总结经验，以提高讲课效果。最后，帮助教员解答问题。唐山市在每一学习单元结束前，各分校都将学员中暴露出来的各种认识问题，汇报总校，由教研室认真研究，做出答案，经市委宣传部审阅批准后，再由原讲人分头进行解答。业余总校共解答了大小四十二种问题，经过问题解答，学员思想普遍提高，因此每次问题解答都受到干部们的热烈欢迎。这是提高教学效果的一个很重要的步骤。
    第三、加强辅导工作。辅导员的工作任务，是经过每一学习单元的预习、复习、讨论与总结等阶段来加深干部对课程的理解。在预习中，辅导员向学员解释文件要点，使之便于接受讲课内容，防止没有中心的盲目阅读。复习中，辅导员指导大家钻研重点，通过核对笔记、漫谈讲课精神，指出参考文件等，来加强自学效果。小组讨论与课堂讨论是消化讲课内容的重要过程。小组讨论是按校部发下题目进行漫谈，辅导员根据小组讨论情况，与校部共同拟制课堂讨论题目，接着辅导员从不同思想认识的学员中，初步拟出课堂讨论发言人名单，培养典型发言。课堂讨论进行中，辅导员要及时提出问题，明确方向，防止放任自流。问题讨论到一定程度时，辅导员可作简单结论。最后，在总结中，辅导员要帮助学员分析收获，批判不正确的学习态度，巩固学习成果。
    要使辅导员能够作好上述的工作，必须加强各级党委的指导和具体帮助。比如，在每个学习单元开始前，各分校都召开辅导员会议（兼职理论教员也参加）布置学习的重点和要求；在课堂讨论前，各分校也召开了同样的会议，讨论课堂讨论题目，作出初步结论；最后，在每一学习单元结束时，分校召集辅导员汇报学习情况，总结辅导工作经验。这对辅导员的提高很有帮助。
    第四、端正学习态度。业余学校开学前，干部们对党史学习存在着各种错误的看法与要求。有些老干部认为党史内容自己早知道了，因此，要求“少讲史实，多讲观点”，有些新干部则抱着好奇的态度，提出相反的要求。在开学时，各级党委进行了深入的学习思想动员，解释了学习方针，批评了各种不正确的学习态度，打下了干部正常学习的思想基础。在学习过程中，各级党委经常进行检查和督促，有的单位支部规定了党员必须在党日汇报自己的学习情况，使干部学习获得了有力的保障。在每个学习单元结束时，通过学习总结，也进行了学习思想的检查，这些工作在端正学习态度上和改进学习方法上都起了很大作用。
        存在的问题
    唐山市业余学校的工作现在还有两个问题：
    第一、在教员问题上，全市兼职教员还实际上没有发挥作用。而专职教员虽然预备功课比较充分，但一般由于工作经验较少，讲课水平还不能很快提高。因此，必须使专职教员与兼职教员结合起来，各司其职，并充分发挥理论教员的作用，提高教学质量，并准备条件，把每班听课人数减少，以加强教学效果。
    第二、辅导员平时和大家一样学习，缺乏专门钻研的时间。辅导员都是本级的学员，水平相差不远，不提高即无法坚持辅导工作。
    以上两个问题需要很好解决。
