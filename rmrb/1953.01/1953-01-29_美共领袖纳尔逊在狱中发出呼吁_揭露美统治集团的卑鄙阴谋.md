Xinhua News Agency, New York, 28th: Stephen Nelson, a leader of the Communist Party in Pittsburgh, who was arrested and imprisoned by the authorities of Pennsylvania in the United States more than a year ago, recently sent an appeal from Pittsburgh Prison. In his letter, Nelson exposed the despicable conspiracy of the American ruling clique to persecute the American Communist Party and progressive elements, and called on peace-loving and democratic people to support the American Communist Party and the American people in their struggle to defend peace and democracy.

Nelson said that the reactionary American authorities sentenced him to twenty years in prison and threw him into a dark, medieval prison simply because "I opposed American war policies, opposed the criminal war in Korea, and my friends and I fought for peace." He continued: "The 'evidence' presented by the prosecutor to prove my 'crime' was: (1) Marxist books, (2) the Stockholm Peace Appeal, (3) I participated in the anti-Franco war, (4) I am the leader of the local Communist Party." Nelson pointed out that the court's prosecutor and several jurors were employees of the Mellon arms trust, and he was even deprived of the right to hire a defense lawyer.

Nelson exposed the deceptive lies of the American ruling clique about "democracy" and "freedom." He said: "They slander me and my friends, deprive us of the rights to speak, think, and act, they persecute, discriminate, and lynch our fifteen million black people day after day, they intimidate immigrants born abroad, deprive them of their citizenship and deport them, all these means irrefutably prove that they want to establish a world monopolized by Wall Street. ..." Nelson then exposed the American authorities' cruel abuse and exploitation of prisoners in prisons, forcing them to engage in hard labor year after year.

Nelson requested strong and just support from trade union members, peace organizations, and all defenders of democracy in order to save the lives of persecuted American Communist leaders and progressive elements from the barbaric persecution of the American ruling clique.

Nelson concluded: "We will never flinch. We have not listened to Hitler's lies. I believe that with your support and other aspects of growing support, we will win peace, and I will not suffer twenty years of torment in an American prison like Dachau concentration camp in Hitler's Germany."

    美共领袖纳尔逊在狱中发出呼吁
    揭露美统治集团的卑鄙阴谋
    【新华社二十八日讯】纽约消息：一年多以前被美国宾夕伐尼亚州当局逮捕下狱的匹兹堡共产党领袖斯蒂芬·纳尔逊，不久以前从匹兹堡监狱中发出一封呼吁信。纳尔逊在信里揭露了美国统治集团迫害美国共产党和进步分子的卑鄙阴谋，号召爱好和平民主的人士声援美国共产党和美国人民保卫和平民主的斗争。
    纳尔逊说，美国反动当局判他二十年徒刑，把他投入一个黑暗的中世纪监狱里，仅仅因为“我曾反对美国战争政策，反对在朝鲜的罪恶战争，我和我的朋友们曾为和平而战斗”。他继续说：“检察官所提出的证明我‘犯罪’的‘证据’是：（一）马克思主义的书籍，（二）斯德哥尔摩和平宣言，
    （三）我曾参加过反弗朗哥战争，（四）我是当地共产党的领袖。”纳尔逊指出，法庭的检察官和好几个陪审员都是梅隆军火托辣斯的雇佣人员，他却连请辩护律师的权利也被剥夺。
    纳尔逊揭发了美国统治集团关于“民主”和“自由”的骗人鬼话。他说：“他们诬陷我和我的朋友们，剥夺我们言论、思想和行动的权利，他们对于我们一千五百万黑人日复一日地进行迫害、歧视和私刑，他们恐吓出生外国的移民，剥夺他们的公民权并把他们驱逐出境，所有这些手段确切不移地证明了他们要建立一个由华尔街独霸的世界。……”纳尔逊接着揭露美国当局残酷地虐待和剥削被投入监狱的囚犯们，他们强迫囚犯长年累月地从事苦役。
    纳尔逊要求工会会员、和平组织和一切民主的保卫者给以强有力的正义的支援，以便从美国统治集团的野蛮的迫害中，拯救被迫害的美国共产党领袖和进步分子的生命。
    纳尔逊最后说：“我们决不畏缩。我们不曾听信希特勒的谎言。我相信在你们的支援和其他方面日益高涨的支援之下，我们一定会赢得和平，而我也不会在希特勒德国的达豪集中营式的美国监狱中受二十年的磨折。”
