    Meat Vendors in Tianqiao Township, Shenqiu County, Henan Selling Diseased Beef Should Be Stopped
    Editor: Meat vendors Liang Cuncai and Li Jianbang in Tianqiao Township market, Ninth District, Shenqiu County, Henan Province, frequently buy and slaughter diseased cattle. As a result, cattle plague has been continuously occurring in the area within ten li around the township market, and more than thirty cattle have died from the disease. Although the township head of Tianqiao Township knows about this matter, he has not reported it to the county district for prevention because he does not care about the lives of the masses. Last November, when meat vendor Li Jianbang went to Zhao Zhuang Township to buy diseased cattle, he was discovered by Liu Jinde, the instructor of the Zhao Zhuang Township government. Although Liu Jinde wrote a letter to the Tianqiao Township government to inform them of this situation, it still did not attract the attention of the township cadres. I believe it is wrong for the cadres of the Ninth District and Tianqiao Township in Shenqiu County to be indifferent to such an important matter concerning the production of farmers in the surrounding villages. In order to prevent the spread of cattle plague, I hope that the Shenqiu County People's Government will pay attention to this issue and immediately send personnel to investigate and deal with it.　Li Lianshan

    河南沈邱县天桥乡肉贩在集市卖病牛肉应予制止
    编辑同志：河南省沈邱县第九区天桥乡集上肉贩梁存材、李见邦经常贩买和宰杀病牛。因而该乡集市周围十里地区不断发生牛瘟，有三十多条牛已因病致死。天桥乡的乡长虽然知道这件事情，但是由于他不关心群众的生活，所以始终没有向县区反映加以制止。去年十一月肉贩李见邦去赵庄乡买病牛时，被赵庄乡政府的指导员刘进德发觉。刘进德虽然把这一情况写信告诉了天桥乡政府，但是依然没有引起这个乡的乡干部注意。我认为沈邱县九区及天桥乡干部对这种关系四乡农民生产的大事漠不关心是不对的。为了防止牛瘟蔓延，希望沈邱县人民政府重视这一问题，并立即派员前往调查处理。　李连善
