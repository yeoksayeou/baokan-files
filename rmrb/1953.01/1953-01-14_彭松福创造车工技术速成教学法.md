    Peng Songfu Creates Speed Training Method for Lathe Technology

    [This newspaper dispatch] Peng Songfu, lathe technology instructor at the Skill Training Class of Factory 203 under the Southwest Industrial Department, has created a "Speed Training Method for Basic Lathe Technology," providing an important method for training a large number of lathe operators in the country's large-scale economic construction. Using this method for teaching, a young lathe operator with a junior high school education and no knowledge of machine production can basically learn the general knowledge and operation technology of the lathe within three months, and can turn all kinds of finished products, which is equivalent to the technical level that used to take two to three years to reach.

    Peng Songfu's "Speed Training Method for Basic Lathe Technology" is based on the operating rules of lathe technology, and divides the basic knowledge and operation methods of lathe operation into eleven steps: (1) Starting the machine, protecting and using the lathe, (2) Grinding tools, installing tools, quenching, clamping objects, correcting, (3) Measuring tools, (4) Reading drawings, (5) Turning male and female sleeves, (6) Turning male and female screws (including gear meshing), (7) Screw gear calculation method, (8) Angle calculation method for chasing and pulling, (9) Retracting skills, (10) Turning spheres, (11) Turning crankshafts. These steps are arranged in order of operation from simple to complex. Therefore, learning the first step prepares you for the next step. After learning these eleven steps, the basic operation method of the lathe is mastered. This method also pays attention to solving the key problems of each step, so it is easily accepted by workers with lower cultural levels. For example, learning to turn male and female screws means that you will know how to turn screw types; the only difference is the size. At the same time, this method also pays attention to concentrating the difficulties, finding the fundamental problems, concentrating on teaching, and fully solving them. For example, when learning to grind tools, in the past, the master helped the apprentice grind or taught the apprentice to grind, and the apprentice often couldn't figure it out for a while, forgetting this and forgetting that. But Peng Songfu teaches all kinds of lathe tool styles, angles, functions, effectiveness, and which tool to use for which type of work all at once. This greatly speeds up the teaching speed and makes it easier for apprentices to remember and learn firmly.

    In order to enable apprentices to learn quickly, Peng Songfu also thought of various methods for tutoring. For example, when teaching measuring tools, he wrote the unit conversions such as one foot equals twelve inches, one inch equals eight fen, and one fen equals four ta on paper and used poker-playing methods to help apprentices memorize them. When reading drawings, he used methods such as projecting hard paper drawings with light to help apprentices read drawings. At the same time, he also organized the apprentices into many mutual aid groups. When encountering difficulties in learning, the mutual aid groups first held "Zhuge Liang Meetings" to exchange learning experiences and opinions, and develop the wisdom of the apprentices. Finally, Peng Songfu made a summary. This is also a reason for shortening the learning time.

    Peng Songfu also proposed that attention should be paid to implementing political and ideological education in the teaching process, explaining that the purpose of speeding up lathe technology is to train lathe operators for the country's large-scale economic construction, so that veteran workers will take the initiative to teach all their skills to apprentices, and so that apprentices will establish a conscious learning attitude. On the basis of such a high teaching and learning enthusiasm, Peng Songfu also formulated a teaching method that combines theory with practice and learning with use, and stipulates that one person should specialize in one type of work, which can greatly shorten the teaching time.

    Comrade Peng Songfu is a member of the Communist Youth League. In the past, he was an apprentice in a technical training class under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. He was beaten and scolded and could not learn any skills. After liberation, he joined the work. Last June, the leadership transferred him to the lathe department of the technical training class as an instructor. When he heard that the country was going to carry out large-scale economic construction, he developed a high degree of class consciousness and patriotism, and decided to summarize his ten years of technical experience and write a systematic textbook, find the key points, and teach according to the systematic textbook and key points, so that the apprentices could quickly learn the technology well. After the factory's party branch secretary and factory director learned of his plan, they talked to him and encouraged him to boldly try it out. The head of the technical training class also sent technicians to help him concretely. After more than a month of efforts, the "Speed Training Method for Basic Lathe Technology" finally achieved success. The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League sent a letter to Comrade Peng Songfu on January 12 to congratulate him.

    彭松福创造车工技术速成教学法
    【本报讯】西南工业部所属二○三厂技工训练班车工技术指导员彭松福，创造了“车工基本技术速成教学法”，为国家大规模经济建设中培养大批车工提供了一个重要方法。用这个方法进行教学，可使一个具有高小文化程度完全没有机器生产知识的青年车工，在三个月内基本上学会车床的一般知识和操作技术，能车各式各样的成品，相当于过去需要两三年时间才能达到的技术水平。
    彭松福的“车工基本技术速成教学法”内容是根据车床技术操作规律，将车工的基本知识和操作法分成十一个步骤：（一）开车、车床的保护和使用法，（二）磨刀、装刀、淬火、夹物、校正，（三）量具，（四）看图样，（五）车公母套，（六）车公母螺丝（包括搭齿轮），（七）螺丝齿轮计算法，（八）追拔角度计算法，（九）车退技，（十）车圆球，（十一）车曲轴。这些步骤是按照操作过程由简单到复杂的顺序排列起来的。所以学会第一步，就给下一步做了准备，学会了这十一个步骤，车工的基本操作法就掌握了。这个方法，还注意解决每一个步骤的关键问题，因此，文化水平较低的工人很容易接受。如学会车公母螺丝，螺丝类的车制法就都会了，不同的就是尺寸。同时，这个方法又注意把难点集中起来，找出根本问题，集中教学，全力解决。如学磨刀，过去师傅帮助学徒磨或教学徒磨，学徒往往一时弄不清楚，磨了这样忘了那样，而彭松福则把所有各种各样的车刀式样、角度、作用、效能以及用那种刀车那一类的活等一次教完。这就使教学速度大大加快，而且使学徒记得住，学得牢。
    为了使学徒很快学会，彭松福又想了多种方法进行辅导。如在教量具时，他把一呎等于十二吋、一吋等于八吩、一吩等于四塔等单位化数，画在纸片上，用打扑克的方式帮助学徒记熟。在看图样时，就用灯光把硬纸图样透影等方法来帮助学徒们看图样。同时，他还把学徒们组成很多个互助组，学习中遇到困难，先由互助组召开“诸葛亮会”，互相交流学习心得和意见，发挥学徒们的智慧，最后由彭松福作总结。这也是使学习时间缩短的一个原因。
    彭松福还提出在教学过程中要注意贯彻政治思想教育，说明车工技术速成的目的，是为国家大规模经济建设培养车工，使老工人主动地把全部技术教给学徒，使学徒们建立自觉的学习态度。在这样的教、学情绪高涨的基础上，彭松福又订出理论与实际结合，学习和使用相结合的教学方法，并规定一人专学一工种，这样又可大大缩短教学的时间。
    彭松福同志是一个青年团员，他过去在国民党反动统治下的技工训练班里当学徒，挨打受骂，什么手艺也学不到。解放以后，他参加了工作。去年六月领导上调他到技工训练班车工部做指导员，他听到国家要进行大规模经济建设，发扬了高度阶级觉悟和爱国主义精神，决定用总结他自己十年技术经验的办法，写出系统教材，找出关键，按着系统教材和关键去教，使学徒们很快学好技术。厂里的党支部书记和厂长知道他的计划后就找他谈话，鼓励他大胆试行，技工训练班主任也派技术员具体帮助他，经过了一个多月的努力，“车工基本速成教学法”终于获得了成功。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在一月十二日并给彭松福同志去信祝贺。
