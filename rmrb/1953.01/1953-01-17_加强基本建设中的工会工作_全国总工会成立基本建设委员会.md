    Strengthening Trade Union Work in Basic Construction
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Establishes Basic Construction Committee
    The Basic Construction Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has been formed and is actively carrying out various tasks.
    Following the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' issuance of the "Decision on Strengthening Trade Union Work in Basic Construction," responsible cadres from basic construction organizations of various industrial trade unions and relevant departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly formed the Basic Construction Committee, which was officially established on December 24th of last year. Basic construction organizations of various industrial trade unions have been established or are being planned. The National Committee of the China Electrical Workers' Union has already established a Basic Construction Committee and has assigned five cadres to specifically manage this work. Before issuing the decision, the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union had already established a Basic Construction Department and sent special personnel to construction sites to understand the situation. It is now increasing its strength to reorganize as a Basic Construction Committee to meet the requirements of the task. In addition, the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union has established a Basic Construction Department; the National Committee of the China Railway Workers' Union has established a New Line Work Department; and the National Committee of the China Ordnance Workers' Union has also assigned several cadres to prepare for the establishment of a basic construction organization.
    On January 5th, the Basic Construction Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its first committee meeting, initially exchanging information on the basic construction situation in various industries and regions. The meeting considered that the main problems in trade union work in basic construction currently are threefold: first, there are too few cadres and insufficient strength; second, there is a lack of experience in trade union work in basic construction, and it is not known where to start; third, the situation of basic construction in various relevant industries is not understood. Therefore, the basic construction organizations of various industrial trade unions should be established quickly. In the near future, various industrial trade unions should rapidly grasp the basic situation of basic construction work and check the implementation of the "Decision on Strengthening Trade Union Work in Basic Construction" in their respective systems. The National Committee of the China Building Workers' Union should immediately organize a working group to go to the Northeast to summarize the experience of implementing labor insurance contracts in basic construction departments, in order to prepare for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations.

    加强基本建设中的工会工作
    全国总工会成立基本建设委员会
    中华全国总工会基本建设委员会已经组成，正积极开展各项工作。
    中华全国总工会发布“关于加强基本建设中工会工作的决定”以后，各产业工会基本建设机构的负责干部和中华全国总工会的有关部门共同组成了基本建设委员会，并于去年十二月二十四日正式成立。各产业工会基本建设机构，都已建立或正在筹设中。中国电业工会全国委员会已经成立了基本建设委员会，并抽调了五个干部专管该项工作。中国纺织工会全国委员会在颁发决定之前，就已经成立了基本建设部，并派专人深入工地了解情况，现正增加力量改设基本建设委员会，以适应任务的要求。此外，中国煤矿工会全国委员会成立了基本建设部；中国铁路工会全国委员会成立了新线工作部；中国兵工工会全国委员会也已抽调了几个干部，准备成立基本建设机构。
    一月五日，中华全国总工会基本建设委员会召开了第一次委员会，初步交换了各产业、各地区的基本建设的情况。会议认为目前基本建设中工会工作主要的问题有三：一、干部少，力量不足；二、缺乏基本建设中工会工作的经验，工作不知从何下手；三、对于各有关产业的基本建设的情况不了解。因此，各产业工会的基本建设机构应很快成立起来。各产业工会于最近期间应迅速掌握基本建设工作的基本情况，并检查一下各该系统对“关于加强基本建设中工会工作的决定”的执行情况。中国建筑工会全国委员会应立即组织工作组赴东北总结在基本建设部门中实行劳动保险合同的经验，为贯彻劳动保险条例作好准备工作。
