Comrades of the People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: We completely agree with and sincerely accept the criticism published in the "Readers' Letters Page" on December 25th last year regarding our county's irresponsible handling of letters from the people. We are now reporting our self-criticism to you.

Our initial delay and subsequent perfunctory attitude towards the reader Gao Shoupao's letter, which you forwarded for investigation and resolution, reflecting the issue of Gao Bucuan, deputy head of the Yubin Township Farmers' Association in Dingcheng District of our county, shielding counter-revolutionary elements like Gao Bucai, was not an isolated incident. We have consistently performed poorly in handling letters from the people. This is because our mass perspective is weak, our ideological understanding of the serious political significance of doing a good job in handling letters from the people is insufficient, and we erroneously believe that "central work is busy, handling letters from the people can be delayed." Therefore, we have not designated a specific person to be regularly responsible for this work, nor have we established the necessary systems. Phenomena such as letters being passed around, mutual buck-passing, superiors not urging and subordinates not acting, or acting unclearly, and not checking after forwarding, exist between departments. This has resulted in many letters from the people being delayed for a long time and not being processed; some have even been lost altogether. For example, in the second half of 1952, the County Party Committee's General Office received approximately 53 letters from the people forwarded from various places and directly sent by the masses (excluding mass accusation materials from the "Three-Anti" campaign and those received by other departments), of which only six were completed, 25 were forwarded to relevant districts or departments but not yet completed, 19 were never processed, and the original letters of three were untraceable due to being forwarded back and forth. When handling letters from the people, we often adopt a bureaucratic attitude, not conducting in-depth investigations, and acting hastily.

In the future, we are determined to earnestly implement the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Party Central Committee, accept the lessons learned from the error in handling Gao Shoupao's letter, improve our understanding of the important significance of handling letters from the people, and conscientiously do a good job in handling letters from the people and receiving people's visits. The County Party Committee's General Office and the Discipline Inspection Commission have designated specific personnel to be responsible for this work, clearing up existing backlog of letters from the people; and establishing regular registration, assignment, urging, inspection, and dispatching of special personnel for investigation and other systems, so as to ensure that every letter from the masses is accounted for, every matter is settled, and processed as early and quickly as possible, without delay or backlog.

### 中共淮安县委决心改进处理人民群众来信的工作

    中共淮安县委决心改进处理人民群众来信的工作
    人民日报读者来信组负责同志：去年十二月二十五日“读者来信专页”刊载了对我县处理群众来信太不负责的批评，我们完全同意并诚恳接受。现在把我们的检查告诉你们。
    我们对你们转嘱调查处理的读者高寿保反映我县丁澄区渔滨乡副农会长高步宽包庇反革命分子高步才等问题的来信，开始时久延不办，后又敷衍了事的态度，不是偶然的事。我们对处理群众来信的工作一直做得很差。这是因为我们群众观点薄弱，对做好处理人民来信工作的严重政治意义在思想上认识不足，错误地认为“中心工作忙，处理人民来信可以缓办”。因此，我们就没有确定专人经常负责这个工作，也没有建立必要的制度。部门与部门之间有信件旅行、互相推诿、上不催下不办或办而不清，以及转出就不检查等现象。这样就使许多人民来信长期拖延，得不到处理；甚至有的连原文都遗失了。如：一九五二年下半年，县委秘书室收到各地转来和群众直接寄来的人民来信约五十三件（“三反”中群众检举材料和其它部门收到的不在内），其中已办完的仅六件，转到各有关区或有关部门而尚未办好的二十五件，一直未办的十九件，原信因转来转去而已无处查找的三件。我们在处理人民来信时，还常采取官僚主义态度，不深入调查，草率了事。
    今后，我们决心切实执行中央人民政府政务院和党中央的指示，接受处理高寿保来信发生错误的教训，提高对处理人民来信工作重要意义的认识，认真做好处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作。县委秘书室和纪律检查委员会已确定专人负责这一工作，清理现有人民来信积案；并建立经常的登记、交办、催办、检查和派专人调查等制度，以做到群众来信事事有交代、件件有着落，并尽早迅速处理，不使拖延积压。
