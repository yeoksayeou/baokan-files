    In order to achieve the goal of basically eliminating smallpox nationwide by 1955, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued instructions on smallpox prevention for 1953 on January 9th.

    The instructions pointed out: Over the past three years, most parts of the country have basically completed the work of universal vaccination, and the number of smallpox patients has significantly decreased. Smallpox has disappeared in many cities. However, in a few remote and backward provinces and counties, this work has not been carried out well. Therefore, it has been decided that starting in 1953, the whole country will implement regular vaccination for newborns and people aged six, twelve, and eighteen, in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Vaccination" promulgated by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government on October 12, 1950. Areas with poor performance should carry out key supplementary vaccinations in addition to regular vaccinations. Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong will be the key provinces for supplementary vaccination nationwide, and each province will focus on remote counties with inconvenient transportation and counties with poor vaccination work. The instructions require that general areas complete supplementary vaccination before December 1953; a few remote and backward areas should complete supplementary vaccination before December 1954.

    The instructions also pointed out: Future vaccination work should be carried out in a planned and organized manner, with each region responsible for its own area. It is best to train two fixed vaccinators in each administrative village who do not separate from production. The vaccinators should preferably be local doctors, cadres of the Democratic Women's Federation, and activists. County-level health cadres will be responsible for training, supervision, and inspection. The vaccination work in cities will continue to mobilize local doctors, and contact should be established with midwives to be responsible for the vaccination of newborns. In the future, if smallpox patients occur in any area, strict isolation must be implemented; vaccination, isolation, and diagnosis should be carried out for contacts, and universal vaccination should be repeated once in the village or district, or even the entire county, where smallpox occurs, as appropriate. To avoid omissions or repetitions in the vaccination work, vaccination household registers can be used. After the vaccination work is completed, vaccination statistics tables and brief summaries should be prepared in spring and autumn, respectively, and reported level by level.

    中央人民政府卫生部发出一九五三年预防天花的指示
    为了达到一九五五年在全国范围内基本上消灭天花这一目的，中央人民政府卫生部于一月九日发出一九五三年预防天花的指示。
    指示中指出：三年来，全国大部地区已基本完成了普种牛痘的工作，天花病人显著减少，很多城市天花已经绝迹。但是在少数边远偏僻的省县，这一工作进行得还较差。因此决定由一九五三年起，全国依照一九五○年十月十二日中央人民政府卫生部公布的种痘暂行办法，施行新生儿和六、十二、十八周岁四种年龄的人口定期种痘。成绩差的地区，除进行定期种痘外，还应进行重点补种。全国以云南、贵州、广西、广东为重点补种省，各省以交通不便的偏僻县份和种痘工作较差的县份为重点补种县。指示要求一般地区在一九五三年十二月以前补种完毕；少数边远偏僻地区在一九五四年十二月前完成补种工作。
    指示中并指出：今后的种痘工作，要有计划有组织地分区负责来进行，最好每个行政村训练两个不脱离生产的固定的种痘员，种痘员最好让地方医生、民主妇女联合会干部、积极分子充任。训练、督导和检查的工作，由县级卫生干部负责。城市的种痘工作仍然动员地方医生进行，同时与接生员取得联系，负责新生儿的种痘工作。今后各地如发生天花病人时，必须严格隔离；对接触者进行种痘、隔离、检诊，并酌情在发生天花的村或区甚至全县重新普种牛痘一次。为了避免种痘工作中的遗漏或重复现象，可以用种痘户口表册。种痘工作结束后，按春秋两季分别造具种痘统计表与简要总结逐级上报。
