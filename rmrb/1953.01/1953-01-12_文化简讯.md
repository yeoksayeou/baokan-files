Nationwide Schools for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Implement Formal Education

    Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Strengthening Formal Education in Schools for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers" in July last year, civil affairs departments and cultural and educational departments across the country have taken active measures to strengthen formal education in these schools. The reorganization of the schools has now been completed nationwide. The original military organizational structure has been abolished in all schools, classes and grades have been organized, the principal-teacher responsibility system has been implemented, collective mutual assistance teaching methods have been adopted, and most schools have established student unions.
    In order to further improve and develop schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers, it is also necessary to gradually solve problems such as increasing the number of teachers, improving the knowledge and ability of school leaders to manage formal school teaching, and increasing school buildings, books, and equipment in the future implementation of formal education.

Capital Establishes Spring Festival Literary and Art Propaganda Work Committee

    The Spring Festival of 1953 is approaching amidst the sound of large-scale national construction. In order to encourage the construction enthusiasm of the masses, the Cultural Affairs Administration of the Beijing Municipal People's Government convened a meeting on the 7th with professional and amateur literary and art groups in the capital to discuss the work plan for Spring Festival literary and art propaganda and established the Capital Spring Festival Literary and Art Propaganda Work Committee to specifically lead this work. The meeting decided to mobilize all professional and amateur literary and art groups as much as possible during this year's Spring Festival, using all forms of art to publicize the great achievements of the motherland and the capital in the past three years, publicize the significance of large-scale economic construction, publicize the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship for safeguarding world peace and China's construction, mobilize the people to carry out the patriotic health campaign in depth and further implement the Marriage Law, etc.
    In order to provide the masses with singing materials for Spring Festival literary and art activities, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers established a "Spring Festival Literary and Art Creation Committee" in mid-December last year, with Lao She as the director. Many literary and art workers in the capital are currently stepping up their creation under the leadership of the committee.

Fifteen Feature Films Started Last Year Mostly Completed

    Of the fifteen feature films started last year by the Northeast, Beijing, and Shanghai Film Studios and the Shanghai United Film Studio under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, most have been completed, except for some that still need to wait for seasonal outdoor scenery to be filmed. They will be released domestically and abroad successively this year.
    Among these films, those that have already been released or are about to be released include the Northeast Film Studio's "People's Fighters", the Shanghai Film Studio's "South and North War", and the Beijing Film Studio's "A Consistent Scourge". Those that have been filmed and will complete post-production work within January include the Northeast Film Studio's "When Grapes Are Ripe", "Gate No. 6", "Harvest", the Beijing Film Studio's "Dragon Beard Ditch", "Cleverly Taking Huashan", and the Shanghai Film Studio's "Golden Silver Beach", etc. Those that can be filmed and completed before March include the Northeast Film Studio's "Marriage" and the Shanghai United Film Studio's "Chicken Feather Letter", "The Sad Story of Liang and Zhu" (a colorful Yue opera stage documentary), "Severing the Devil's Claws", "Great Creation" (tentative title).
