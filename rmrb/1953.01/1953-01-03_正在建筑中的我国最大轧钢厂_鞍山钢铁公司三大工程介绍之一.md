    China's Largest Rolling Mill Under Construction
    —One of the Introductions to the Three Major Projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    Ai Zhi, Chang Gong

    In the second half of 1953, Anshan will have a factory going into production that will produce steel materials with a value equivalent to nearly 21% of the total grain harvest of tens of millions of farmers in Northeast China in 1952, if converted to grain. This factory is the Anshan Large-Scale Rolling Mill, one of the three modern iron and steel manufacturing projects that began construction in Anshan in 1952 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government and with the great assistance of the great Soviet Union.

    Once completed, this project will process large quantities of steel billets produced by the Anshan Steel Plant into large steel materials necessary for constructing railways, bridges, and various large-scale buildings, such as steel rails, angle steel, I-beams, channel steel, square steel, and steel billets for rolling seamless steel pipes. For many years in the past, China has relied on imports for these large steel materials necessary for modern industrial construction. Because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which only knew how to harm the country and the people, did not build a single such rolling mill during its long years of rule in China; the Anshan Large-Scale Rolling Mill built by the Japanese only had an annual output of more than 100,000 tons of steel. Therefore, in the past, the Chinese people were forced to spend millions of tons of grain and other goods to buy this kind of steel from foreign countries every year. This not only increased the burden on the Chinese people but also seriously hampered the development of China's industry and economic independence. Therefore, changing this situation and building new rolling mills has become a serious task for the Chinese people after liberation. Otherwise, we will not be able to smoothly build our industry.

    According to the planned schedule, after the completion of the Anshan Large-Scale Rolling Mill, it can produce light and heavy steel rails and various types of steel (type steel is the general term for angle steel, I-beams, channel steel, etc.). The plant's annual output of steel rails can lay a railway line from Changchun to Guangzhou, and the annual output of type steel can build fourteen giant modern rolling mill plants as large as this large-scale rolling mill; there are also tens of thousands of tons of seamless steel pipe billets. The total annual output of steel materials from this factory is greater than the highest annual output of all steel materials from the old Anshan Iron and Steel built by the Japanese invaders. However, the number of workers required after this factory starts operation is only half of that of the old Anshan Large-Scale Rolling Mill. This means that the degree of automation and mechanization and the production capacity of the plant far exceed those of the old Anshan Large-Scale Rolling Mill built by the Japanese invaders.

    How large is the construction project of this factory? This is a difficult question to answer at once. For example, a concrete base for installing a machine in this project is equivalent to a two-story building with forty 20-square-meter rooms. The concrete, steel, and wood used in this project alone are more than what is needed to build a first-class five-story building of 8,000 square meters. However, this project is only a basic project in the entire project, and the concrete, steel, and wood required for the entire project can fill at least 18,000 large trucks with a load capacity of five tons. If we talk about its mechanical equipment, it is even larger. A component of a rolling mill in the plant weighs 30 tons, and a machine's foundation bolt weighs 1.8 tons. Mechanical equipment must be used when installing these components or bolts. Otherwise, it is impossible for one person to move it at all.

    The technology required to build this project almost includes the technological achievements of the entire era of the rolling mill industry. Here, let us not talk about the fact that its more than 12,000 tons of machines must be installed to a certain elevation point and a certain center line, nor about the fact that the horizontal error in installing these machines is not allowed to exceed half a hair's breadth, nor about the vast amount of technology required in designing this project, let us just talk about the fact that determining the plant site alone takes one year. The soil tests at the time of determining the plant site are nearly 400 kinds. This kind of test work must be carried out with the help of Soviet comrades, because our country does not yet have the strength to undertake all of this work. Of course, the technology required for this work is not complicated compared with the vast amount of technology required for the entire design and other work.

    Judging from the large scale of the large-scale rolling mill, many people must think that it must require thousands of tens of thousands of people to work, right? But in fact, after it starts production, it only needs 640 people. This number includes 86 administrative staff, technical staff, and logistics staff. When the workers are engaged in production, they do not need to run around, let alone engage in any heavy labor. They sit separately on more than 60 consoles. Watching the machine and pressing the button or operating various machines, a ton and a half of steel material will run out of the heating furnace by itself, go through various complicated processes, and become the finished product required. Even the machine oiling and the opening and closing of doors and windows in the plant are automated and mechanized. If the workers feel too hot on hot days, they only need to press a button, and hundreds of doors and windows in the entire plant will open together. If you need to open half, or a few of them, of course, you only need to press a button. Writing here reminds us of that day, August 1, 1952. When Comrade Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, dug the first shovel of soil for the start of this project that day amid the thunderous cheers of tens of thousands of workers, many old workers were so excited that they shed tears. Yes, this is worth being excited about! Our country has just been completely liberated for more than three years, and we can build such a grand and modern rolling mill. How can we not be excited!

    Indeed, building such a large-scale and technically complex giant project is our first time, but under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, with the great help of the Soviet people, and with the extraordinary efforts of tens of thousands of workers in Anshan, this project is proceeding at an unprecedented speed. After the project started on August 1, 1952, we encountered many difficulties that seemed difficult to overcome under the current conditions in our country, both technically and in terms of material supply, but we not only overcame them, but also, by the end of November, had almost completed more than half of the entire project. Now all the staff and workers of the project are working hard to strive for the start of production in the second half of 1953. (Attached picture)

    正在建筑中的我国最大轧钢厂
    ——鞍山钢铁公司三大工程介绍之一
    爱芝  常工
    一九五三年下半年，鞍山将有一个这样的工厂开工生产：每年生产的钢材的价值若折合粮食，几近一九五二年全东北几千万农民粮食总收获量的百分之二十一。这个工厂就是在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，在伟大苏联的巨大援助下，一九五二年在鞍山开始动工兴建的三大近代化钢铁制造工程之一的鞍钢大型轧钢厂。
    这项工程建成后，它将把鞍山制钢厂所产的大批钢坯制成建筑铁路桥梁及各种大型建筑所必需的大型钢材，如钢轨、角钢、工字钢、槽钢、方钢及轧制无缝钢管用的钢坯等。这些近代化工业建设中所必需的大型钢材，在我国过去许多年来，一直是依靠国外进口。因为只知祸国殃民的蒋介石匪帮，在统治我国的漫长岁月中，没有建造一处这样的轧钢厂；日本人建造的鞍山大型轧钢厂，也不过年产十多万吨钢材。所以我国人民在过去每年便不得不被迫拿出数以百万吨计的粮食及其他物品，到外国去购买这种钢材。这不仅增加了我国人民负担，同时也严重地妨害了我国工业的发展和经济独立。所以，改变这种情况，建立新的轧钢工厂，就成了我国人民在解放后的一项严重工作。否则，我们便不能顺利建设我国工业。
    根据预定计划，鞍钢大型轧钢厂建成后，可生产轻、重钢轨和各种型钢（型钢即角钢、工字钢、槽钢等钢的总称）。该厂年产钢轨，可铺一条从长春直到广州的铁路，年产型钢可盖十四个像该大型轧钢厂一样大的巨型近代化轧钢厂厂房；还有数以万吨计算的无缝钢管管坯。这个工厂年产钢材的总和，比日本侵略者建造的旧鞍钢的全部钢材最高年产量还多。但是这个工厂开工后所需的工人，则仅及旧鞍钢大型轧钢厂的一半。这就是说，该厂在自动化、机械化的程度与生产能力上，远远超过了日本侵略者建造的旧鞍钢大型轧钢厂。
    这个工厂的建筑工程究竟有多大呢？这是一个难以一下解答的问题。例如该工程的一个安装机器的混凝土座子，就等于一座具有四十个二十平方公尺房间的两层大楼大。仅此一工程所用的混凝土、钢材、木头，比盖一座八千平方公尺的五层一等大楼所需要的混凝土、钢材、木头还要多。但是，此项工程还只是整个工程中的一个基础工程，而整个工程所需要的混凝土、钢材、木头，却起码能装一万八千个载重五吨的大卡车。如果说到它的机械设备，那就更大。该厂一个轧钢机的部件，就重三十吨，而一个机器的地脚螺丝，就重一点八吨。在安装这些部件或螺丝的时候，都必须使用机械。否则，一个人要动它一下都是不可能的。
    建筑这一工程所需的技术，几乎包括我们这一整个时代的轧钢工业的技术成就。在这里，我们且不说它的一万二千余吨机器必须安装到一定标高点和一定中心线上，也不说在装这些机器的时候，水平不准误差半根头发的尺寸，也不说在设计这一工程中所需要的浩繁技术，只说说确定厂基一项就需
    一年的时间。确定厂基时的土壤化验即近四百种，这种化验工作，必须苏联同志帮助进行，因为目前我国还没有力量把这项工作全部担负起来。当然，这项工作所需技术，和整个设计等工作所需要的浩繁技术比较起来，还是不算复杂的。
    从大型轧钢厂的宏大规模来看，一定有很多人认为它必须用上千上万的人才能工作吧？但事实上等它开工生产后，却只用六百四十个人。这个数字中，还包括了八十六个行政管理人员、技术人员及勤杂人员。工人们在进行生产的时候，无须跑来跑去，更无须进行任何笨重劳动，他们分坐在六十多个操纵台上。望着机器，按按电钮或操纵着各种机械，一吨半重的钢料，便会自己跑出加热炉，经过各种复杂工序，变成所需要的成品。就连该厂机器注油及门窗开闭，也都是自动化与机械化的。如果工人们在热天觉得太热了，只要一按电钮，全厂的几百个门窗便一起开了。如果你需要开一半，或某几个的话，当然也只须按一下电钮。写到这里，使我们想起了一九五二年八月一日那天。当那天中共鞍山市委书记韩天石同志，在几万个工人的雷声样的欢呼中，为这一工程的动工挖起第一锹土的时候，许多老工人都兴奋的流泪了。是的，这是值得兴奋的！我们国家刚刚全部解放三年多，就能建设这样宏大与近代化的轧钢工厂，我们怎能不兴奋呢！
    诚然，建筑如此规模浩大、技术复杂的巨大工程，我们还是初次，但是，在毛主席的英明领导下，在苏联人民的巨大帮助下，在鞍山几万工人的非凡努力下，这项工程正以空前未有的速度进行着。一九五二年八月一日该工程开工之后，我们不管在技术上，在物资供应上，都曾遇到了许多在目前我国条件下似乎难以克服的困难，但是我们不但把它克服了，而且到十一月底，已几近完成了整个工程的一半以上。现在该工程的全体职工，正为争取一九五三年下半年开工生产而奋勇地劳动着。（附图片）
