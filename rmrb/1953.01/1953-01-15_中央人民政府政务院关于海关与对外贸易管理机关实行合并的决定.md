    （一九五三年一月九日政务院第一百六十六次政务会议通过）
    为了迎接国家大规模经济建设和扩大对外贸易的任务，进一步贯彻对外贸易政策，全国对外贸易的管理监督工作必须在领导上、组织上更加统一与集中，因此，特决定：
    一、报请中央人民政府委员会批准：将中央人民政府海关总署划归中央人民政府对外贸易部领导，成为对外贸易部的组成部分，改称中央人民政府对外贸易部海关总署。对外贸易部的对外贸易管理总局应即与海关总署实行合并，按工作需要，调整机构人员。海关总署在对外贸易部的领导下，仍按中华人民共和国暂行海关法和对外贸易管理暂行条例的规定，组织与管理全国海关组织及其业务，并行使其他应有的职权。
    二、各口岸对外贸易管理局及其分支机构应即与当地海关实行合并，统称海关。合并后内部组织机构、人员编制应有步骤地进行合理的调整。关于干部的任免暂按海关现行规定办理。
    三、中华人民共和国暂行海关法总则所规定的海关任务与职权，全国各地海关仍应继续遵照执行。凡在设有对外贸易管理机关的口岸海关，自合并之日起，应即遵照对外贸易管理暂行条例的规定，执行下列各项任务：
    （一）执行对外贸易许可制度，审查价格，签发进出口许可证；
    （二）管理登记进出口厂商；
    （三）拟订本口岸进出口计划，报中央批准，并组织其实现。
    四、各地海关组织建制属于中央，直属于中央人民政府对外贸易部海关总署，同时并受海关所在地大行政区或省、市财政经济委员会的监督指导。海关员工中的一切政治教育工作由大行政区行政委员会指定适当的地方机关负责领导，并得对海关干部的任免提出建议。
    五、各大行政区或省、市财政经济委员会对海关指导监督的范围如下：
    （一）监督检查各地海关对全国性政策、法令、任务、计划的贯彻执行；
    （二）督导海关拟订地方进出口业务计划报经中央批准后施行；
    （三）根据中央统一规定，督导海关掌握出口审价工作；
    （四）掌握决定属于地方特许类的进出口货物，并督导各地海关执行；
    （五）决定地方性临时紧急问题的处理办法；
    （六）解决海关与当地有关机关的联系和工作配合问题。
    六、中华人民共和国暂行海关法和对外贸易管理暂行条例，应由中央人民政府对外贸易部根据合并后海关的工作情况，提出必要的修订意见，报政务院批准公布施行。在未公布修订前，原暂行海关法和对外贸易管理暂行条例仍属有效。
