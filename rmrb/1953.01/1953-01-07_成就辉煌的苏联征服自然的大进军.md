Under the guidance of advanced Michurin agricultural science, Soviet agricultural scientists and collective farm members have achieved a brilliant victory in their great march to conquer nature. They have cultivated many new varieties of industrial raw material crops, grains, fruit trees, and vegetables, and by using advanced agricultural techniques, they have made many crops thrive in areas where they could not grow in the past, thereby expanding the planting area of these crops and causing significant changes in the Soviet agricultural geography.

In terms of industrial raw material crops, thanks to the Soviet agricultural scientists' cultivation of many new cotton varieties that can mature in 160 to 180 days, the geographical boundary of cotton planting areas has been moved from 43 degrees north latitude to 49 degrees north latitude, that is, extending northward by more than 600 kilometers. Now, the republics of Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Kuban and the Volga River basin, have developed cotton planting industries; the three states of Stalingrad, Rostov, and Dnepropetrovsk have become the northernmost cotton planting areas in the world. In the past, the area where the Soviet Union planted sugar beets was limited to Ukraine and Kursk Oblast. However, under the Soviet regime, this "natural sugar beet producing area" has long been broken through. Now, from Central Asia to Siberia, from the Baltic republics to the Far East Primorsky Krai, sugar beets are planted throughout the Soviet Union. Sugar beets have even reached the Arkhangelsk Oblast near the Arctic Circle, taking root in the fields surrounded by dense pine and fir forests. Experiments by Soviet agricultural scientists have also proved that sugar beets can even grow within the Arctic Circle. For a long time, people believed that jute could only grow in countries such as India, but Soviet scientists have not only made Indian jute acclimatize to the soil and water of Central Asia, but also cultivated completely new Soviet jute varieties. One of them, called "Uzbek Firstborn," has great vitality and matures quickly, with stalks up to three meters high and a yield of 800 to 900 jin of dry stalks per mu. The area where the Soviet Union plants jute is expanding northward year by year.

In terms of grains, in recent years, Soviet agricultural scientists have cultivated about 60 excellent new wheat varieties that can resist drought, cold, and diseases (many of which can adapt to the soil and water of the northern non-black soil zone), making wheat thrive on land where only coarse grains such as rye could grow in the past. In addition, wheat has also grown on the dry grasslands of the Volga region and on the barren land of the Takyr area in the Kara-Kum Desert, where no grass grew in the past. Soviet scientists have also cultivated some early-maturing new rice varieties that can mature smoothly in the short summer of the north and have the characteristics of resisting diseases and cold and requiring less water. These new rice varieties have enabled the Soviet rice-growing area to move northward. In recent years, golden rice fields have appeared in northern Kazakhstan, the Caucasus, the Kuban Basin, southern Ukraine, Crimea, and Rostov Oblast. Last year, many collective farms in Voronezh, Tambov, and other states in the central European part of the Soviet Union planted rice for the first time and happily reported a bumper harvest. For example, the "Red Don" collective farm in Voronezh Oblast harvested 1,027 jin of rice per mu.

Previously, tea trees in the Soviet Union only grew in Georgia, around 42 degrees north latitude, and the quality of the tea produced was not high. Now, not only do many collective farms here have tea gardens that can produce 1,300 to 1,600 jin of high-quality tea per mu, but also tea gardens have appeared in Krasnodar Krai, Azerbaijan, and the Kazakh Republic. Last year, collective farms in Transcarpathian Oblast of Ukraine, located at 49 degrees north latitude, began planting tea, making it the northernmost tea-producing area in the world.

Soviet scientists have cultivated hundreds of new fruit tree varieties suitable for the climate of various regions, enabling people to promote southern fruit trees to the north. Citrus fruits and other subtropical fruits have broken through the subtropical regions of the Black Sea coast of Georgia, the hidden valleys of southern Turkmenistan, and the Tajik Republic. Now, not only in the southern states of the Russian Federation, Kuban, Moldova, and other places, but also in the cold places of Vinnytsia and Kamenets-Podolsky in the Ukrainian Republic, located at 49 degrees north latitude, subtropical fruit orchards such as lemons, oranges, and tangerines have appeared. In those areas, many orchards have blossomed and bear fruit, and collective farmers have tasted the sweet and delicious subtropical fruits produced locally for the first time. The citrus fruits planted in cold regions are dwarf new varieties, which grow in special trenches. In the Turkmen Main Canal area, the agricultural experimental station planted 2,000 Guangdong lemon seedlings brought from China on saline soil representing the soil characteristics of the canal area, and now 90% of these seedlings are growing well.

In addition, Soviet scientists have cultivated many new varieties of cold-resistant and high-yielding tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbages, and other vegetables for planting in the northern states of the Soviet Union. Tomatoes can now grow in Murmansk Oblast near the Arctic Circle, yielding 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu; on the permafrost of the remote Kamchatka Peninsula, potatoes, cabbages, onions, and other vegetables can thrive.

    成就辉煌的苏联征服自然的大进军
    在先进的米丘林农业科学的指引下，苏联农业科学工作者和集体农庄庄员征服自然的大进军获得了辉煌的胜利。他们培育了许多工业原料作物、谷物、果树和菜蔬的新品种，并且运用先进的农业技术，使许多农作物在过去不能生长的地区茁长起来，从而扩大了这些农作物的种植面积，使苏联农业地理发生了显著的变化。
    在工业原料作物方面，由于苏联农业科学家培育了许多能在一百六十到一百八十天里成熟的棉花新品种，植棉区域的地理界线已从北纬四十三度推移到北纬四十九度，即向北伸展了六百多公里。现在，乌克兰、摩尔达维亚两共和国和库班、伏尔加河流域都已发展了植棉业；斯大林格勒、罗斯多夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克三州成了世界上最北的植棉区。过去苏联种植甜菜的区域只限于乌克兰和库尔斯克州。但在苏维埃政权下，这个“天然甜菜产区”早被突破了。现在，从中亚细亚到西伯利亚，从波罗的海区各加盟共和国到远东滨海边疆区，甜菜的种植遍及苏联各地区。甜菜还到了接近北极圈的亚尔干日尔州，在那被稠密的松柏树林围绕着的田野中生了根。苏联农业科学家的实验还证明了，甜菜甚至在北极圈内也能生长。很久以来，人们都认为黄麻只能在印度等国生长，但苏联科学家不但已使印度种的黄麻服习于中亚细亚的水土，而且已培育出全新的苏联种黄麻。其中一种叫做“乌兹别克头生子”的黄麻，具有极大的生命力，而且成熟很快，麻秆高达三公尺，每亩可产八九百斤干麻秆。苏联种植黄麻的地区正在逐年向北方扩展。
    在谷物方面，苏联农业科学家近几年来培育出约六十种能抗御干旱、严寒和不生病害的优良小麦新品种（其中许多种能服习于北方非黑土地带的水土），使小麦在过去只能生长裸麦等粗粮的土地上繁茂滋长。此外，在伏尔加区域的干燥的草原上、在卡拉·库姆沙漠过去寸草不生的塔基尔地方的贫瘠土地上，小麦也已成长起来。苏联科学家还培育了一些早熟的新稻种，能在北方短暂的夏季中顺利成熟，并具有抵抗病害和寒冷、需水少的性能。这些新稻种使苏联种稻地区能向北方推移。几年来在哈萨克北部、高加索、库班流域、乌克兰南部、克里米亚和罗斯多夫州，都已出现了一片片金黄色的稻田。去年苏联欧洲中部的佛罗内兹、坦波夫和其他各州的许多集体农庄第一次种稻，并已喜告丰收，例如佛罗内兹州的“红色顿河”集体农庄每市亩收到了一千零二十七市斤稻谷。
    苏联的茶树以前仅仅生长在位于北纬四十二度左右的格鲁吉亚，而且这些茶产的质量不高。现在不仅这里有许多集体农庄的茶园能够每市亩产出一千三百到一千六百市斤上等茶叶，而且克拉斯诺达边疆区、阿塞拜疆和哈萨克共和国都出现了茶园。去年，位于北纬四十九度的乌克兰外喀尔巴阡州的集体农庄已开始种茶，这是世界上最北的产茶区。
    苏联科学家培育出适合各地区气候的数百种果树新品种，使人们能够把南方的果木向北方推广。柑橘类和其他亚热带果类，已经突破了格鲁吉亚的黑海沿岸、土库曼南部隐蔽的山谷和塔吉克共和国等的亚热带地区。现在，不但俄罗斯联邦南部州区、库班、摩尔达维亚等地，而且位于北纬四十九度的乌克兰共和国文尼萨和卡门内茨——波陀尔斯克等寒冷地方也都已出现了柠檬、橘子、红皮橘等亚热带果树园。在那些地区，许多果园都已开花结实，集体农民们第一次尝到本地出产的香甜可口的亚热带果品。在寒冷的地区种植的柑橘类果树是矮小的新品种，它们生长在特别的壕沟中。在土库曼大运河区，农业实验站把从中国运来的两千株广东柠檬的树苗种植在代表运河区土壤特性的盐质土壤上，现在这些树苗百分之九十都长得很好。
    此外，苏联科学家培育了许多耐寒和产量高的番茄、黄瓜、卷心菜和其他菜蔬的新品种，供苏联北部州区种植。番茄已可以在接近北极圈的摩尔曼斯克州生长起来，每亩可以产三四千斤；在遥远的堪察加半岛的冻土上，马铃薯、卷心菜、洋葱和其他菜蔬都已可以繁茂生长。
