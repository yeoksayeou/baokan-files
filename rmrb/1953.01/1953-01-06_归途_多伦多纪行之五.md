    Homeward Bound
    —Toronto Travelogue Part 5
    Wu Wentao
    Belief
    Last year, on August 8th, the 18th International Red Cross Conference closed. While preparing for the return journey, I had time to think: what consistent voices have I personally witnessed and heard in conversations, that I can bring from outside the threshold of American imperialism to our readers on the other side of the earth?
    Workers are impoverished and unemployed; farmers, when the new wheat came on the market last year, still hadn't sold their 1951 wheat; a senior postal and telecommunications official with a monthly salary of three hundred gold dollars has to use half of his income to pay income tax and rent, so that even a glass of beer becomes a luxury for him; mothers are demanding that the government ban the import of "joke" books to prevent them from poisoning children; several young people, mentioning Canada's failure in the Olympic Games, resent the government for investing steel in arms production, without even materials to build a swimming pool... Everyone has their own problems and understanding, but everyone is united on one point, which is: opposing the Canadian government's pursuit of the United States in launching wars of aggression, and demanding peace. The evil consequences of the war of aggression against Korea have been seriously reflected in the lives of ordinary people; people increasingly believe that if the United States expands its war of aggression, the flames of war will eventually burn onto Canadian soil.
    But today, traitors are still rewarded here, and patriots are punished; those who advocate wars of aggression are in power, and those who talk about peace are persecuted. Dr. James Gareth Endicott, chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, who visited New China and accused the U.S. military of conducting bacteriological warfare in China, was regarded as "Public Enemy Number One" by the Canadian rulers. Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson cursed him as "despicable" in Parliament, threatening to "interrogate him and suppress him if necessary"; reactionary parliamentarians demanded that he be "isolated."
    How do the people treat Dr. Endicott? From the end of April until we left Toronto, people across the country had invited him to give nearly fifty lectures introducing New China. The "Conference for Peace, Disarmament and Trade" held in Toronto from May 10th to 11th, had three thousand representatives from all walks of life across the country who listened to and discussed Dr. Endicott's report, and passed the famous "Peace Pledge"; the open-air rally of 11,000 people in "Maple Leaf Park" on the evening of the 11th, demanding peace and condemning the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare, was an unprecedented massive gathering in the history of Toronto. The reactionaries were greatly shocked. The weapons—eggs—carried by a large number of fascist thugs hired in advance to disrupt the meeting were also crushed in their pockets by the pickets spontaneously organized by unemployed workers.
    Dr. Endicott's father (Chinese name "Wen Huanzhang"), a respected old pastor nearly ninety years old, introduced his son's life and answered the reactionaries' slanders at the open-air rally, saying: "I don't believe these slanders come from the hearts of the Canadian people... Absolutely not!... I am still proud of him!" His words expressed the voice of the Canadian people.
    The people want peace, and the people love soldiers like Dr. Endicott who fight for peace. Those who are increasingly being "isolated" among the people are not the soldiers who defend peace, but the American war profiteers and their lackeys in Ottawa. With this belief, we left Canada on August 13th last year.

    Back to Brussels
    On the morning of August 14th last year, we arrived in Brussels on our way home. Brussels had been attracting the attention of people in Europe and elsewhere for several days. On August 14th, Belgian newspapers reported that as a result of the general strike on the 9th in which workers across the country supported soldiers against extending military service, the Belgian Catholic Socialist government had to abandon its two-year military service plan and changed the term of military service to twenty-one months.
    Comrades from the Czechoslovakian Ambassador to Belgium and his wife, as well as secretaries and staff, came to the airport to take care of us. Some Belgian friends also came to the airport and told me that the nationwide workers and general public's support for young men enlisting to oppose the extension of military service was a volcanic eruption of the people's will not to be cannon fodder for American aggressors. Regardless of the obstruction of the socialist trade union leaders, the workers insisted on their struggle and finally forced the General Confederation of Labor to formally announce a general strike. This was the largest and most politically significant strike since the working class opposed the return of King Leopold III, who surrendered to the Nazis, in the spring of 1950.
    War merchant Eisenhower's formula for the North Atlantic Aggression Group is: "Fighting requires men and guns; Western Europe provides the men, and the United States provides the guns!" Plague General Ridgway wanted to coerce six Western European countries at the Paris meeting on August 12th to implement the two-year military service system that the Belgian government had already promised. However, after the general strike of workers in Belgium, even the French Socialist Party's "People's Daily" clamored: "The mere fact that the reactionary government of Belgium has mindlessly adopted a two-year military service system cannot be a reason for other European countries to follow suit." This was a heavy slap in Ridgway's face!
    At lunchtime, three American Air Force officers, accompanied by a dozen people in plain clothes, passed through the outer room of the airport café where we were resting and went to the inner room to hold some kind of meeting. The sleepless air travel overnight made people want to calm down and take a nap, but those Americans insisted on giving speeches one after another like donkeys braying. They repeatedly said, "It's not that we want to come to Europe, but the Russians want to come to you, so we have to come and help you and protect the security of the free world in Western Europe..." It seems that these guys are in charge of building American air force bases in Belgium; under the opposition of the Belgian people, they are imitating the old tune of Hitler and Goebbels to carry out "appeasement" work.
    How can it be appeased? In Western Europe, from Britain to France, people have long tasted the flavor of American protection. Tens of thousands of American soldiers and so many air bases are essentially the same as the United States occupying the British Isles. Once dusk falls, British women near the base dare not go out for fear of being kidnapped by the "protectors." France is even more so, where the situation is increasingly similar to the rampant behavior of the American army during the period when the traitor Chiang Kai-shek seized China.
    American imperialism is burying explosives in Western Europe to destroy itself!

    Hometown
    At one o'clock in the afternoon, we set off to fly back to Czechoslovakia. This was the shortest section of the entire journey. It takes less than three hours to fly from Brussels to Prague. But time seemed to pass particularly slowly, a minute felt like an hour. At this time, the sky was clear and the mountains and villages were clearly visible. We kept asking the stewardess on the plane what city it was, where we had arrived... She kindly pointed them out to us. Finally, she announced: we have flown over the border between the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia.
    She pointed out the window and said, "Look, more and more new houses and large farms." I followed her gaze, the brand-new factories and residential areas on the land of the German Democratic Republic near the Czechoslovak border were shining brightly, completely unlike West Germany, which was full of gray; on the collective farms, the wheat had already been harvested, and it was also completely unlike West Germany, where the fields were crisscrossed like patches on clothes, showing the poverty of the farmers. This is the stewardess's identification mark based on her long-term experience of flying service, which also proves that right and wrong are all in people's hearts. When any honest Western European sees the glorious peaceful construction from the German Democratic Republic to Czechoslovakia and other people's democratic and socialist countries, wouldn't they think of the hunger and unemployment that their own people and the people of other Western European countries are suffering? Wouldn't they think of how deeply the slogan of the striking workers, "We want houses, we want butter, not cannons" has penetrated people's hearts?
    I have flown this road from Brussels to Prague more than once. Only this time coming back from Canada, I saw it particularly clearly along the way. After being away from Czechoslovakia for three weeks, I felt it was even more adorable. When the plane landed at Prague Airport, my feeling was that I had returned to my hometown, although my hometown was still ten thousand miles to the east.

    归途
    ——多伦多纪行之五
    吴文焘
    信念
    去年八月八日，第十八届国际红十字大会闭幕了。在准备回程的当中，我有时间来想想：我亲眼看到的以及在谈话中听到的，有些什么一致的呼声，可以从美帝国主义的门槛外带给在地球另一边的我国的读者们呢？
    工人穷困失业；农民们在去年新麦登场的时候，一九五一年的麦子还没有卖出去；一个每月三百金元薪金的邮电局高级职员，要用一半的收入交纳所得税和房租，以致一杯啤酒对他都成了奢侈品；母亲们要求政府禁止“笑料”书进口，以免毒害儿童；几个青年提到加拿大在奥林匹克运动会上的失败，愤恨政府把钢铁投到军火生产上去，连修个游泳池的材料都没有……各人有各人的问题和认识，但大家在一点上是一致的，这就是：反对加拿大政府追随美国进行侵略战争，要求和平。侵朝战争的恶果，已经严重地反映在一般人的生活中；人们日益相信：如果美国扩大侵略战争，战火终将会烧到加拿大国土上来。
    但今天，这里还是卖国者侯，爱国者诛；鼓吹侵略战争者当权，谈和平者受迫害。曾访问过新中国并控诉了美军在中国进行细菌战的加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士，就被加拿大统治者目为“第一号公敌”。加拿大外交部长皮尔逊在议会上骂他“可恶”，扬言“将审问他，必要时镇压他”；反动的议员们要求“把他隔绝起来”。
    人民怎样对待文幼章博士呢？从四月底到我们离开多伦多时为止，全国各地群众已经请他作了近五十次介绍新中国的演讲。五月十日—十一日在多伦多城举行的“争取和平、裁军与通商会议”，有全国各界三千名代表听取并讨论了文幼章博士的报告，通过了有名的“和平誓言”；十一日晚“枫叶公园”一万一千人要求和平、斥责美国进行细菌战的露天大会，更是多伦多城历史上少有的巨大集会。反动派大为震惊。他们预先雇用的大批法西斯匪徒所带的捣乱会场的武器—鸡蛋，也被失业工人自动组织的纠察队挤烂在裤袋里。
    文幼章博士的父亲（中文名“文焕章”），年近九旬、德高望重的老教长，在露天大会上介绍自己儿子的身世并回答反动派的诬蔑说：“我不相信这些诬蔑是从加拿大人民心中来的……绝对不是！……我仍然以他而感到骄傲！”他的话正表达了加拿大人民的心声。
    人民要和平，人民爱戴文幼章博士这样为和平而奋斗的战士。日益在人民中被“隔绝”的，不是保卫和平的战士们，而是美国的战争贩子及其在渥太华的喽啰。怀着这种信念，我们在去年八月十三日离开了加拿大。
    再到布鲁塞尔
    去年八月十四日清早，我们在归途中到了布鲁塞尔。布鲁塞尔几天来正吸引着欧洲和其他地方人们的注意。八月十四日比利时报纸上登载着：由于九日全国工人支持士兵反对延长兵役运动的总罢工的结果，比利时天主教社会党政府不得不放弃了两年兵役计划，把兵役期限改为二十一个月。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻比公使夫妇和秘书随员等同志又来机场照料我们。这次到机场来的还有一些比利时的朋友，他们告诉我：全国工人和一般人民支援入伍青年反对延长兵役，是人民不愿为美国侵略者当炮灰的意志的一次火山似的爆发。不顾社会党工会领袖们的阻挠，工人们坚持了自己的斗争，最后迫使总工会不得不正式宣布总罢工。这是继一九五○年春天工人阶级为了反对投降纳粹的国王利奥波得第三回国以来最大一次的有重大政治意义的罢工。
    战争贩子艾森豪威尔给北大西洋侵略集团所订的公式是：“打仗需要人和枪；西欧出人，美国出枪！”瘟疫将军李奇微本想在八月十二日的巴黎会议上胁迫六个西欧国家实行比利时政府已承诺了的两年兵役制。可是在比国工人总罢工之后，连法国社会党的“人民报”，都吵着说：“仅仅由于比利时的反动政府已经毫无思想地采取了两年兵役制，并不能成为其他欧洲国家效尤的理由。”这使李奇微的脸上重重地挨了一巴掌！
    吃中饭的时候，三个美国空军军官带了十来个穿便服的人，经过我们休息的飞机场咖啡馆外间，到里间去开什么会。一夜没有合眼的空中旅行，使人想静下来打个盹，可是那些美国佬偏要一个接一个像驴叫似地演讲。他们反复地说：“不是我们想来欧洲，而是俄国人要到你们这里来，使我们不得不来帮助你们，保卫西欧自由世界的安全……。”看样子，这几个家伙是经管在比利时修筑美国空军基地的；在比利时人民的反对下，他们模仿着希特勒—戈培尔之流的老腔调，来进行“平复”工作。
    怎样能平复得了呢？在西欧，从英国到法国，人们早已尝到了美国保护的滋味了。成万的美国兵，多少个空军基地，实际上美国等于把不列颠岛占领。一到黄昏，基地附近的英国妇女们就不敢外出，以防被“保护者”掳去。法国更不用说，那里越来越和卖国贼蒋介石窃据中国时期美军横行跋扈的情况相像了。
    美帝国主义正在西欧埋下摧毁自己的炸药！
    故乡
    下午一点钟，我们动身飞回捷克斯洛伐克。这是在全程上最短的一段路。从布鲁塞尔到布拉格不到三个钟头。可是时间似乎过得特别慢，一分钟像一点钟那样长。这时天朗气清，山川村落历历在目。我们不断向飞机上的女招待员打听那里是什么城，已经到了什么地方……。她都和蔼地给我们指点。终于，她宣布：我们已经飞临德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的边境了。
    她指着窗外说：“你看，大片的新房子和大片的农场越来越多了。”我随着看去，临近捷克斯洛伐克国境的德意志民主共和国土地上的崭新的工厂和住宅区闪着光亮，完全不像西德那样到处呈现着灰暗的气色；在集体农场上，麦子已经收割了，也完全不像西德那样错综得像布条子打补绽的衣服似的、表现着农民穷困的田野。这是女招待员根据自己长期随机服务的经验而得出的辨认今天东、西欧间分界的标志，这也证明天下的是非黑白是尽在人心的。当任何一个正直的西欧人看到从德意志民主共和国到捷克斯洛伐克以及其他人民民主国家与社会主义国家的辉煌的和平建设时，难道不会想到自己和其他西欧国家的人民正在遭受着饥饿和失业的痛苦？难道不会想到罢工工人所提的口号：“要房子，要牛油，而不要大炮”是怎样深入人心吗？
    这一路，从布鲁塞尔到布拉格，我已经飞过不只
    一次了。只是这次从加拿大回来，沿途看得格外清楚。离开了捷克斯洛伐克三星期，觉得它更加可爱了。当飞机在布拉格机场一着陆的时候，我的感觉是回到故乡了，虽然故乡还在万里以东。
