    The Bastion of Socialist Culture – The Lenin State Library of the USSR
    On a street near the Kremlin in the center of Moscow stands a massive, magnificent multi-story building. Next to it is a building constructed in the 18th century with a unique architectural style. These two buildings house the world's largest book repository – the Lenin State Library of the USSR.
    The Lenin Library is unparalleled in the world in terms of the number of books it holds, the number of readers it serves, and the number of books it loans out. This grand library houses nearly fifteen million volumes of books, pamphlets, magazines, and bound newspapers, published in 160 languages worldwide.
    Among the library's greatest spiritual treasures are the first edition of Marx's "Das Kapital," almost all of the works of Marx and Engels throughout their lives, and the first editions and various versions of the works of Lenin and Stalin. It also holds the complete works of Lenin published in 77 languages of the Soviet nationalities.
    The Lenin Library holds 27,000 manuscript books, over two million leaflets, slogans, woodcuts, and original manuscripts of works by great Russian writers such as Tolstoy, Gogol, Pushkin, Turgenev, and Herzen.
    The rare books department houses extremely valuable publications. Here are massive books printed on wooden boards, and small books only half a centimeter long. Here is also an unparalleled sample of Russian printing – a miniature edition of Krylov's Fables published in 1856, with a printing surface of less than 14 millimeters, truly a miracle of printing art. Among the 170,000 printed publications in the rare books department are also 5,200 volumes of the Chinese encyclopedia "Tushu Jicheng" and many works of classical Chinese literature. The Lenin Library also holds a large collection of various famous and important modern Chinese books and periodicals. Currently, the Lenin Library has over 60,000 Chinese books, 6,000 magazines, and 25,000 Chinese newspapers. In the first half of 1952, more than 1,000 people requested to borrow Chinese literary books.
    The Lenin Library has a large number of readers. In the library's thirteen reading rooms, an average of 1,500 readers study daily. The average daily number of people who come to borrow, read, and visit is over 5,000. In 1951 alone, 1.7 million people visited the Lenin Library, which provided them with nearly nine million books and magazines. The Lenin Library's book delivery system is fully mechanized – the underground stacks even have a small railway. Therefore, it takes no more than twenty or thirty minutes to find any book a reader needs from among the millions of books.
    Among the readers of the Lenin Library, one can see people of different ages and professions. There are university students and composers, generals and doctors, advanced workers and collective farmers from the suburbs, academicians of the Academy of Sciences and film directors, sculptors and actresses.... They are all here concentrating on studying the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, enriching their knowledge in history, philosophy, economics, literature, art, and other fields, or preparing their dissertations and conducting specialized research.
    It is not only Muscovites who enjoy the Lenin Library's most precious collections, but also readers living in Leningrad, Kiev, Baku, Rostov, and dozens of other large and small cities throughout the Soviet Union. According to the needs of readers in various places, the Lenin Library carefully packages and sends hundreds of books and publications to all parts of the country every day.
    Of course, the Lenin Library may sometimes be unable to meet the needs of certain readers. For example, if a reader in Vladivostok needs a rare or unique book, the original cannot be lent to him. Therefore, the most frequently requested rare and valuable books are microfilmed and reproduced. The use of these microfilm books and newspapers not only greatly facilitates readers in Moscow, but also greatly increases the number of readers in other places, especially remote cities.
    The work of the Lenin Library is not limited to providing books and allowing readers to search the catalog. It also regularly organizes reader seminars, scientific lectures, writer-reader forums, etc., and provides commemorative and historical materials. The publication of book indexes is also an important task. It publishes the "New Books Catalog" every year to introduce newly published Soviet works to readers and sends a large number of book cards to libraries across the country. In addition, it often publishes many thematic book indexes and reference catalogs.
    The Lenin Library's collection of books is increasing day by day. All publishing agencies of books, periodicals, newspapers, and other printed materials in the Soviet Union regularly send it samples. Thousands of books, magazines, and a large number of newspapers are sent to the library's receiving department every day. After receiving them, the library immediately compiles catalogs and provides them for a large number of readers to borrow. The Lenin Library also regularly exchanges books with China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic, as well as other countries. This work effectively promotes cultural exchange between the Soviet Union and various countries.
    The Lenin Library is a university for all the people of the Soviet Union and a bastion of socialist culture. Every day, thousands upon thousands of readers come here in a constant stream. Here, they tirelessly study the Marxist-Leninist theory that guides all work, understand and enhance their knowledge in all aspects, and improve their cultural level. (Attached picture)

### 社会主义文化的堡垒——苏联国立列宁图书馆

    社会主义文化的堡垒——苏联国立列宁图书馆
    在莫斯科市中心克里姆林宫近旁的一条大街上，矗立着一座巨大宏伟的多层建筑物。在它旁边，还有一座在十八世纪建筑起来的、具有奇特建筑风格的大厦。这两座建筑物就是世界最大的藏书库——苏联国立列宁图书馆。
    列宁图书馆无论在藏书数量上，在读者人数上，和在出借书籍的数量上，都是举世无双的。这个宏大的书库珍藏着以全世界一百六十种语言出版的近一千五百万卷书籍、小册子、杂志和报纸合订本。
    在图书馆的最伟大的精神宝库中，藏有马克思所作的“资本论”的初版本，马克思与恩格斯一生几乎所有的著作，列宁、斯大林的著作的初版本和各种版本。这里还藏有以七十七种苏联各民族语言出版的列宁全集。
    列宁图书馆存有两万七千册手抄本书籍，有两百多万份传单、标语、木刻和托尔斯泰、果戈理、普希金、屠格涅夫、赫尔岑等伟大俄罗斯作家的作品的手迹原稿。
    稀有书籍部收藏着极宝贵的出版物。这里有刻印在木板上的巨大书籍，有长仅半公分的小书。这里还有俄国印刷术的无与伦比的样本——一八五六年出版的克雷洛夫寓言的缩小本，它的印刷面不到十四毫米，可称印刷艺术上的奇迹。在稀有书籍部的十七万册印刷出版物中，还包括数达五千二百卷的中国百科全书“图书集成”和许多中国古典文学作品。中国现代各种著名重要的书籍报刊在列宁图书馆中也有大量的储藏。现在列宁图书馆共有六万多种中文书籍、六千本杂志与两万五千份中文报纸。一九五二年上半年内要求借阅中国文艺书籍的有一千多人。
    列宁图书馆拥有大量的读者。在图书馆的十三个阅览室里，每天平均有一千五百个读者在自修。前来借书、阅读和访问的人数，每天平均在五千人以上。在一九五一年一年内访问过列宁图书馆的共有一百七十万人，图书馆供给他们将近九百万册书籍和杂志。列宁图书馆的递送书籍的工作已经全部机械化了——地下书库里甚至铺设有小型铁道。因此，要从千百万本藏书中间找读者所需要的任何书籍，最多也不会超过二、三十分钟。
    在列宁图书馆的读者中间，可以看到不同年龄、不同职业的人们。这里有大学生和作曲家，有将军和医生，有先进工人和从近郊来的集体农民，有科学院的院士和电影导演，有雕刻家和女演员……。他们都在这里聚精会神地钻研马克思列宁主义的经典著作，丰富自己在历史、哲学、经济、文学、艺术等各方面的知识，或者准备自己的学位论文和进行专题研究。
    享用列宁图书馆最珍贵的藏书的不仅是莫斯科人，而且还有居住在列宁格勒、基辅、巴库、罗斯多夫以及苏联其他几十个大小城市的读者。列宁图书馆按照各地读者的要求，每天用妥善的包装往全国各地寄出几百件的书籍和出版物。
    当然，列宁图书馆有时也可能无法满足某些读者的需要。譬如说，如果海参崴的一个读者需要一本稀有的或者独一无二的书，那么这本书的原本就不能借给他了。因此，为读者所最需要的种类繁多的稀有珍本，都用微粒胶片加以影印和复制。利用这些影印书籍和报纸，不但大大便利了莫斯科的读者，而且使其他地方特别是遥远的城市的读者数目也大为增加了。
    列宁图书馆的工作并不限于供应图书和让读者查询图书目录。它还要经常组织读者座谈会、科学讲演、作家与读者座谈会等，并供应纪念日的文献和历史材料，出版图书索引工作也占有重要地位。它每年出版“新书目录”，向读者介绍新出版的苏联著作，并向全国各地的图书馆发送大量的图书卡片。此外，还常常出版许多专题的书籍索引与参考目录。
    列宁图书馆的藏书数量正在一天比一天增加着。苏联所有出版书刊报章与其他印刷品的出版机关都按期向它寄送样本。成千种书籍、杂志和大批报纸每天寄到图书馆的收发部来。图书馆在收到后就立刻编制目录，供给大量读者借阅。列宁图书馆也经常和中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国以及其他国家交换书籍。这一工作，有效地促进了苏联和各国的文化交流。
    列宁图书馆是苏联全体人民的大学，是社会主义文化的堡垒。每天都有成千成百的读者川流不息地来到这里。他们在这里孜孜不倦地学习着指导一切工作的马克思列宁主义理论，通晓与增进了各方面的知识，提高了自己的文化水平。（附图片）
