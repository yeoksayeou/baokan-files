Xinhua News Agency, January 24th – Over 70,000 construction workers, management cadres, and technical personnel in the North China region's capital construction units have received political education during winter training. Currently, some capital construction units' winter training work has entered the technical education stage.

The main gains of the first stage of winter training for construction workers in North China were: strengthening the organization and discipline of construction workers. In the past, construction workers were mostly accustomed to scattered and mobile work, going away in winter and returning in spring, and unaccustomed to collective life. At the beginning of winter training, capital construction units in various places first explained the significance of winter training to construction workers and cadres, and did a good job in providing for daily life and cultural entertainment. In this way, workers felt the warmth of the big family in both spirit and material, and their morale stabilized. Subsequently, various capital construction units conducted more than 20 days of political education, aiming at the ideological situation of construction workers, which greatly improved the workers' class consciousness and confidence in doing their work well. For example, the bricklaying team of the First Working Area of the First Engineering Company directly under North China has already inspected the quality of last year's projects during the winter training period, and put forward slogans to ensure the quality of wall construction, prevent accidents, avoid wasting a single brick or a handful of mortar, strive to use all new tools this year, and ensure obedience to leadership and assignments. Wang Zhenguo, an old worker from the Baoding City Construction Company in Hebei Province, had never taught apprentices in the past, fearing that "teaching apprentices would starve the master." This time, after criticizing his past conservative thinking in the winter training, he taught twenty-eight apprentices in just half a month. A worker surnamed Song from the Beijing Construction Engineering Company, after comparing the old and new societies and undergoing grievance-airing education, confessed: "In the past, when compacting earth, I would do a good job when cadres were present, but when cadres left, I would be sloppy. This is not the attitude of a master!" After political study, the workers' sense of responsibility for their work has generally been strengthened. In addition to actively exposing some shortcomings of the leadership, they have also put forward many rationalization proposals. For example, some workers suggested that tools and materials should be transported to the site before construction to prevent work stoppages waiting for materials. Some workers suggested that all equipment drawings and civil engineering drawings should be timely and accurate to avoid rework and waste.

At present, the technical and professional education conducted by capital construction units in North China during winter training is in accordance with the professional learning policy of "learning what you do." The learning methods of teaching, discussion, experience introduction, and on-site operation are combined, learning while doing, and teaching while doing, so that after winter training, the staff will improve technically and become the backbone of this year's capital construction.

### 华北建筑工人冬训工作进入技术教育阶段

    华北建筑工人冬训工作进入技术教育阶段
    【新华社二十四日讯】华北区各基本建设单位七万多名建筑工人和管理干部、技术人员在冬训中受到了政治教育。目前部分基本建设单位的冬训工作已进入技术教育阶段。
    华北各地建筑工人冬训第一阶段的主要收获是：加强了建筑工人的组织性和纪律性。过去的建筑工人，多习惯于冬去春来，散漫流动，过不惯集体生活。各地基本建设单位在冬训开始时，首先向建筑工人、干部讲解了冬训的意义，搞好了生活和文化娱乐；这样，工人们在精神上物质上感到大家庭的温暖，情绪都稳定下来。接着，各基本建设单位针对建筑工人的思想情况，又进行了二十多天的政治教育，这就使工人的阶级觉悟和搞好业务的信心大大提高。例如华北直属第一工程公司一工区的瓦工队，在冬训期间已经检查了去年的工程质量，并提出保证砌墙质量，不出事故，不浪费一块砖一把灰，争取今年全部使用新工具以及保证服从领导和调动的口号。河北省保定市建筑公司老工人王振国，过去从来没有教过徒弟，怕“教会徒弟饿死师傅”；这次冬训中他在批判了过去的保守思想以后，只半个月的时间，就教会了二十八个徒弟。北京市建筑工程公司一个姓宋的工人，经过新旧社会对比和诉苦教育以后，他忏悔地说：“过去打灰土，见干部来就干得好，干部一走，就马马虎虎，这那像个主人翁的劳动态度！”经过政治学习，工人们对工作的责任心普遍加强，除了主动地揭发了领导方面的一些缺点，还提出了不少合理化建议。如有的工人建议在施工前，应把工具、材料运到现场，防止停工待料；有的工人建议一切设备图样及土木工程图样要及时、准确，以免返工浪费。
    目前华北各基本建设单位在冬训中进行的技术业务教育，是按照“做啥学啥”的专业学习方针，用传授、讨论、经验介绍和实地操作相结合的学习方法，边做边教，边教边做，以使经过冬训的职工，在技术上提高一步，成为今年基本建设中的骨干。
