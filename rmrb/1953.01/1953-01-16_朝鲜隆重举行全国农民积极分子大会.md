Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 15th: The Korean National Congress of Active Farmers was solemnly held in Pyongyang from January 5th to 8th. The conference summarized the agricultural production work in 1952 and discussed the agricultural production tasks for 1953.

The Korean people's leader, General Kim Il-sung, and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Kim Tu-bong, attended the meeting on the first day.

Park Mun-gyu, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Korean Cabinet, delivered a report on the summary of agricultural production work in 1952 and the preparation and countermeasures for agricultural production in 1953. Park Mun-gyu pointed out that in the past year, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the Republic government, Korean farmers have carried out selfless struggles to increase food production, overcome all wartime difficulties, and achieved a great harvest. Korean farmers widely adopted advanced farming methods, launched a mass movement to increase production, and assisted each other in production. As a result, the sown area of ​​paddy and dry land in 1952 exceeded the state plan by 2.7 percent, and the total annual output of grain increased by 13 percent compared with 1951, and 130,000 tons more than the highest harvest year of the Republic—1948. He pointed out that the enthusiastic support of the people of various democratic countries, and the defense and assistance of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, are one of the reasons for the Korean farmers' bumper harvest.

When talking about the guidelines and tasks of agricultural production this year, Park Mun-gyu pointed out that in 1953, the cultivated land area should be expanded to 104.4 percent of that in 1952, and the total grain output should be increased to 105 percent of that in 1952. Advanced farming methods should be further promoted, and mass production increase competitions and mutual assistance movements should be carried out more extensively. Park Mun-gyu also called on bumper harvest farmers to further expand their ranks, actively increase production and support the front, and strive for new victories.

At the meeting, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea awarded medals to active farmers who had made contributions on the front line of increasing production and supporting the front last year. Yu Man-ok, a model martyr's family member and a female farmer with bumper harvests, was awarded the First Class National Flag Medal. Bai Xin-quan, a model military family member, and two others were awarded the Labor Medal. Kang Wen-sun, a young female farmer who trained 634 female plowmen last year, and ten others were awarded the Second Class National Flag Medal. Jin Da-sik and Xu Zhen-shan, bumper harvest farmers who set the national record for unit area yield of rice and cotton last year, and thirty-five others were awarded the Third Class National Flag Medal. In addition, hundreds of active farmers were awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.

Finally, the conference unanimously adopted an appeal to farmers across the country and letters of thanks to Stalin, Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    朝鲜内阁农林相朴文圭在会上作了关于一九五二年农业生产工作总结和一九五三年农业生产准备及进行对策的报告。朴文圭指出：去年一年中，朝鲜农民在劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，为增产食粮进行了忘我的斗争，克服战时一切困难，获得了大丰收。朝鲜农民广泛地采用了先进农作方法，展开了群众性的增产运动，并在生产上互相进行协助，结果使一九五二年水旱田的播种面积超过了国家计划的百分之二点七，使谷物全年的总产量比一九五一年增产了百分之十三，比共和国最高收获年度——一九四八年增产了十三万吨。他指出：各民主国家人民的热烈支援，和朝中人民军队的保卫与协助，是朝鲜农民取得丰收的原因之一。
    朴文圭在谈到今年农业生产的方针和任务时指出：一九五三年要把耕地面积扩大到一九五二年的百分之一零四点四，把谷物总产量提高到一九五二年的百分之一零五，进一步推广先进农作方法，更广泛地开展群众性的增产竞赛运动和互助运动等。朴文圭并号召丰产农民进一步扩大自己的队伍，积极增产和支援前线，争取新的胜利。
    会上，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会向去年在增产支前战线上建立了功勋的农民积极分子们授勋。模范烈属、丰产女农民俞万玉荣获一级国旗勋章，模范军属白心全等二人荣获劳动勋章，去年培养了六百三十四名女扶犁手的青年女农民康温顺等十人荣获二级国旗勋章，去年稻子和棉花单位面积产量创全国最高纪录的丰产农民金大植和许镇善等三十五人荣获三级国旗勋章，此外，有农民积极分子数百人荣获功劳奖章。
