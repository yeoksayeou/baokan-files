Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The recent change of the French cabinet and the fall of U.S.'s loyal servant, Foreign Minister Schuman, have cast a new shadow over the U.S.'s "European Army" plan. The U.S. ruling clique is worried that the turmoil in the French political situation will further delay the approval of the "European Army" plan. Baldwin, a well-known reactionary military commentator in the U.S., wrote in the "New York Times" on the 12th that one of the main problems the new Eisenhower government, which came to power on the 20th, "first encountered is the crisis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." And an important part of this is the crisis facing the "European Army" plan.

　　Despite the U.S. government's long-term exertion of open and planned pressure on Western Europe, the timetable for establishing the "European Army" has been repeatedly disrupted. The "European Army" plan was first proposed on October 24, 1950, by then French Prime Minister Pleven under the instruction of the U.S. From February 1951, representatives from France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg began negotiations to organize the "European Army." The U.S. originally attempted to end the negotiations in the first half of 1951, but serious disputes occurred repeatedly during the negotiations, and they did not end until May 9, 1952. On May 27, 1952, the foreign ministers of the aforementioned countries and West Germany signed the treaty on organizing the "European Group" and establishing the "European Army" in Paris. Afterwards, the U.S. tried its best to get the parliaments of these countries to approve this treaty as soon as possible. However, until now, no country's parliament has approved it. West German Bonn government's Chancellor Adenauer twice requested the Bonn parliament to approve the treaty quickly in November and December 1952, but both were unsuccessful. The parliaments of France, Italy, and other countries have not yet discussed the treaty.

　　The "European Army" plan has been difficult to produce because it has exacerbated the contradictions between the U.S. and Western Europe and within Western Europe. The central content of the "European Army" plan is to arm West Germany. The so-called "European Group" will become a part of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, and the "European Army" will be under the jurisdiction and command of the North Atlantic Military Command. In this army, the twelve divisions of West German Nazi troops planned to be rebuilt will occupy a dominant position. Through the "European Army," the U.S. not only wants to drag the most aggressive German militarists in Europe into the North Atlantic Group but also wants to use the German militarists as U.S. constables to rule Western Europe. U.S. magazines do not shy away from saying that the U.S. intends to revive the West German war machine as a pistol to point at Western European countries and force them to accept the U.S.'s will. Under the connivance of the U.S., West German Nazi generals have also clamored that after the West German army is armed, it will be used to maintain the "domestic order" of France and Italy.

　　At the same time, the "European Army" under the command of the North Atlantic Military Command will actually become the U.S.'s "foreign legion." After the "European Army" is established, France, Italy, and all other member states will actually no longer have their own national armies, and the parliaments of various countries will no longer have the right to decide the country's military budget and conscription period. Everything will be decided by the "supranational organization" controlled by the U.S. Through this "supranational organization," the U.S. will be able to establish stricter control over Western European countries in military and economic terms.

　　The "European Army" plan seriously threatens the security of Western European countries and undermines their national sovereignty. Therefore, it has been fiercely opposed by the people of Western European countries. The vast number of people in France and other Western European countries who have suffered from German militarism oppose the U.S. arming West Germany. In France, 9 million people signed the declaration "I oppose the rearmament of Germany." The vast number of German people who have experienced the disaster of war also oppose being dragged into the abyss of destruction again. 15 million people in West Germany have voted against the "general treaty" for rearmament. Smith, the head of the U.S. International News Service's European branch, admitted that the anti-American sentiment of the Western European people "will give a fatal blow to the plan to establish a European army."

　　Another factor that has made the "European Army" difficult to produce is the increasingly sharp contradictions between the ruling groups of Western European countries and the U.S. ruling group, and the increasingly sharp contradictions between the Western European countries and the West German ruling group. First of all, the French ruling group is afraid that the realization of the "European Army" plan will put Western Europe under the "U.S.-German rule." Many French bourgeois figures openly accuse such a plan of eventually "annexing France by West Germany." Even important bourgeois representatives such as French National Assembly Speaker Herriot, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Jacques Baudu, and former Prime Minister Daladier have recently publicly opposed the current form of the "European Army" treaty. During the "European Army" negotiations, the ruling groups of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg also repeatedly expressed their fear of "U.S.-German rule" and therefore adopted a delaying attitude towards the composition of the "European Army."

　　The struggle between Britain and the U.S. for hegemony in Western Europe is the third factor that has made the "European Army" difficult to produce. The British ruling group sees that the realization of the "European Army" plan will destroy Britain's position in Europe, so it is secretly trying its best to undermine the formation of the "European Group." Although the U.S. has repeatedly exerted pressure, both the former Labour government and the current Conservative government in Britain have resolutely refused to participate in the "European Army."

　　The above factors have delayed the "European Army" plan for a long time. The U.S. ruling group is afraid that such a delay will cause the entire plan to go bankrupt. U.S. news agencies have revealed that the first task of the new Eisenhower government in Europe after taking office is to coerce France and West Germany to quickly approve the "European Army" treaty. The new U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has also decided to go to Western Europe at the end of January to give "instructions" to the Western European rulers in person. However, regardless of whether the U.S. servants in Western Europe will approve the "European Army" treaty, the people of Western Europe will never approve it. At the same time, the further the U.S. goes in arming West Germany and depriving the rights and interests of Western European countries, the more intense the contradictions between the U.S. and Western Europe will become, and the greater the obstacles the U.S. will encounter in realizing its aggressive plans.

### 美帝国主义筹划的“欧洲军”计划面临危机

    美帝国主义筹划的“欧洲军”计划面临危机
    【新华社二十二日讯】最近法国内阁的更迭以及美国的忠驯奴仆、外交部长舒曼的下台，使美国的“欧洲军”计划蒙上了一层新的暗影。美国统治集团正在忧虑着法国政局的动荡会使“欧洲军”计划的批准更加拖延。美国有名的反动军事评论家鲍德温十二日在“纽约时报”上写道：二十日上台的美国艾森豪威尔新政府“首先遭遇到的主要问题之一，是北大西洋公约组织的危机”。而其中重要的一环，就是“欧洲军”计划所面临的危机。
    尽管美国政府对西欧长期施加公开的和有计划的压力，然而建立“欧洲军”的时间表已经是一再被破坏了。“欧洲军”计划最先是在一九五○年十月二十四日由当时法国总理普利文在美国指使下提出的。一九五一年二月起，法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡的代表即开始举行组织“欧洲军”的谈判。美国原来企图使谈判在一九五一年上半年结束，但是，谈判过程中一再发生严重的争执，直到一九五二年五月九日才结束。一九五二年五月二十七日，上述各国和西德的外交部长在巴黎签订了组织“欧洲集团”及建立“欧洲军”的条约。以后美国又竭力企图使这些国家的议会从速批准这个条约。但是，直到如今，还没有一个国家的议会批准它。西德波恩政府总理阿登纳在一九五二年十一、十二月曾两度要求波恩议会从速批准这个条约，但都没有成功。法国、意大利等国议会则还没有讨论过这个条约。
    “欧洲军”计划的难产，是因为这个计划加剧了美国与西欧之间及西欧内部的矛盾。“欧洲军”计划的中心内容就是武装西德。所谓“欧洲集团”将成为北大西洋侵略集团的一个组成部分，“欧洲军”将归北大西洋军司令部管辖和指挥。在这支军队中，计划重建起来的十二师西德纳粹军队将占支配地位。美国通过“欧洲军”的方式，不仅要把欧洲最富侵略性的德国军国主义者拖入北大西洋集团，而且要把德国军国主义者作为美国统治西欧的宪兵。美国杂志并不讳言美国打算复活西德战争机器作为手枪，用来指着西欧各国，强迫它们接受美国的意志。在美国纵容下，西德纳粹将领也已在叫嚣说，西德军队被武装起来以后，就要用来维持法国和意大利的“国内秩序”了。
    同时，归北大西洋军司令部指挥的“欧洲军”，实际上将成为美国的“外籍兵团”。在“欧洲军”成立以后，法国、意大利等一切成员国实际上就将没有自己的国家军队了，各国议会也不再有权决定该国的军事预算和兵役期限了。一切都将由美国控制下的“超国家机构”决定。美国通过这个“超国家机构”，就能在军事及经济上对西欧各国建立更严密的控制。
    “欧洲军”计划严重地威胁着西欧各国的安全，破坏各国的民族主权，因此它遭到了西欧各国人民的猛烈反对。曾受德国军国主义荼毒的法国及西欧其他国家广大人民反对美国武装西德，法国就有九百万人在“我反对重新武装德国”的宣言上签名。经受战争灾难的德国广大人民也反对再度被拖入毁灭的深渊，西德已有一千五百万人投票反对重新武装的“一般性条约”。美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长史密斯承认：西欧人民的反美情绪“对建立欧洲军的计划将给予致命的打击”。
    使“欧洲军”难产的另一个因素，是西欧大陆各国与美国统治集团间日益尖锐的矛盾，以及西欧各国与西德统治集团间日益尖锐的矛盾。首先是法国统治集团，他们害怕“欧洲军”计划实现后将使西欧处于“美德统治”之下。许多法国资产阶级人士公开指责这样的计划最后将使“西德并吞法国”。连法国国民议会议长赫里欧、外交委员会主席雅克·巴杜、前总理达拉第等这些重要的资产阶级代表最近也公开反对“欧洲军”条约的目前形式。在“欧洲军”谈判过程中，比利时、荷兰及卢森堡三国统治集团也一再表露出对“美德统治”的恐惧，因而对“欧洲军”的组成采取拖延态度。
    英美两国争夺西欧霸权是使“欧洲军”难产的第三个因素。英国统治集团看到“欧洲军”计划的实现将摧毁英国在欧洲的地位，因而在暗地里竭力破坏“欧洲集团”的形成。虽然美国一再施用压力，英国的前任工党政府和现任保守党政府都坚决拒绝参加“欧洲军”。
    上面这些因素已使“欧洲军”计划拖延了漫长的岁月。美国统治集团害怕这样拖延下去，会使计划整个破产。美国通讯社已经透露，艾森豪威尔新政府上台后在欧洲的第一个任务就是胁迫法国和西德迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。美国新国务卿杜勒斯并且已经决定要在一月底赴西欧一行，向西欧统治者面授“训令”。然而，不论西欧的美国仆从会不会批准“欧洲军”条约，西欧人民是永远不会批准它的。同时，美国在武装西德、在剥夺西欧各国权益上走得愈远，就使美国与西欧间的矛盾越加剧烈，就会使美国侵略计划的实现遇到更大的阻碍。
