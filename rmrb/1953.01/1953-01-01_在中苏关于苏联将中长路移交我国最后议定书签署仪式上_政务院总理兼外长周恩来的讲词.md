(Xinhua News Agency, December 31st) The full text of the speech by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Administration Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, at the signing ceremony of the final protocol between China and the Soviet Union on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway by the Soviet Government to the People's Republic of China, held in Harbin on December 31st.

Comrade Chairman, Comrade Ambassador, Comrades!

    According to the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian of February 14, 1950, and the Sino-Soviet Announcement on the Transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway of September 15, 1952, the Sino-Soviet Joint Committee has today completed the work of transferring all rights of joint management of the Chinese Changchun Railway by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as well as all property belonging to the railway, to the Government of the People's Republic of China completely and without compensation. This is a major event in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union. I would like to congratulate the successful completion of this transfer and, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government, express my deep gratitude to the great Soviet people, the Soviet Government, and Comrade Stalin.

    During the period of joint Sino-Soviet management of the Chinese Changchun Railway, thanks to the tireless assistance of Soviet comrades, the young Chinese railway construction industry has achieved remarkable success, and our transportation industry has played a huge role in the economic construction of New China. The Chinese people will never forget this brotherly friendship and assistance from the Soviet people. In particular, it should be mentioned here that thanks to the enthusiastic and patient guidance of Soviet comrades, the Chinese employees of the Chinese Changchun Railway have learned advanced Soviet experience and have helped us train a large number of cadres in the railway construction industry of New China. On the occasion of the completion of the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway, I thank Comrade Yelogov and all the Soviet comrades working on the Chinese Changchun Railway for their outstanding work, which has enabled our new railway construction industry to achieve such great gains.

    The transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Chinese government is of great and far-reaching significance. As everyone knows, since 1945, due to the Soviet Union's defeat of Japanese imperialism and the liberation of Northeast China, and also because the Chinese people, encouraged and supported by the Soviet people, have achieved a historic victory against imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, and established an unprecedentedly unified people's country, the situation in the Far East has undergone fundamental changes. These changes have provided ample possibilities for China and the Soviet Union to conclude, in 1950, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which marks the brotherly friendship and permanent cooperation between the two countries, based on the fundamental interests of the two peoples. On the basis of this alliance treaty, it was stipulated that the Chinese Changchun Railway would be transferred to the Chinese government free of charge no later than the end of 1952. Today, the Soviet government generously and selflessly fulfills its obligations, which shows the Soviet government's infinite loyalty to the brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union. This completely new type of brotherly cooperation between our two countries is undoubtedly a shining example unparalleled in the history of international diplomacy.

    The great friendship between China and the Soviet Union is further consolidated and developed. We firmly believe that the great and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union will not only contribute to the construction of our two great countries, but will also be an invincible force in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

    Long live the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live Comrade Stalin, the closest friend of the Chinese people and the great teacher of the people of the world!

    在中苏关于苏联将中长路移交我国最后议定书签署仪式上
    政务院总理兼外长周恩来的讲词
    【新华社三十一日讯】我中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来于十二月三十一日在哈尔滨举行的中苏关于苏联政府将中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国最后议定书的签署仪式上的讲词全文。主席同志、大使同志、各位同志们！
    根据一九五○年二月十四日中苏关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定和一九五二年九月十五日中苏关于移交中国长春铁路的公告，中苏联合委员会今天完成了办理苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府完全归其所有的工作。这是中苏两国友好合作关系上的重大事件，我谨祝贺这一移交工作的胜利完成，并代表毛泽东主席和中央人民政府向伟大的苏联人民、苏联政府和斯大林同志表示深切的感谢。
    在中苏共同管理中国长春铁路期间，由于苏联同志不辞劳苦的帮助，使年青的中国铁路建设事业获得了卓越的成就，并使我们的运输事业在新中国的经济建设中起了巨大的作用，中国人民对苏联人民这一兄弟般的友谊援助将永志不忘。特别要在此提出的：由于苏联同志们热情而耐心的指导，使中国长春铁路的中国职工学到了苏联的先进经验，并帮助我们培养了新中国铁路建设事业中的大批干部。在完成中国长春铁路移交工作的今天，我感谢以叶洛果夫同志为首的在中国长春铁路工作的全体苏联同志们，因为他们的卓越工作，才使我们新的铁路建设事业有这样大的收获。
    中国长春铁路的移交给中国政府，是具有十分重大和深长的意义的。大家知道，自一九四五年以来，由于苏联击败了日本帝国主义者，解放了中国的东北，又由于中国人民在苏联人民的鼓舞和声援之下取得了反对帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动政府的历史性的胜利，建立了空前统一的人民的国家，远东形势已经起了根本的变化。这些变化提供了充分的可能性，使中苏两国能在一九五○年根据两国人民的根本利益，订立了标志着两国兄弟友谊和永久合作的中苏友好同盟互助条约，并在这个同盟条约的基础之上规定了中国长春铁路不迟于一九五二年末无偿地移交给中国政府。今天苏联政府慷慨无私地履行她所担负的义务，这表明苏联政府对于中苏兄弟般的同盟事业的无限忠诚。我们两国之间的这种完全新型的兄弟般的合作关系，毫无疑义地是国际外交史上无可比拟的光辉榜样。
    中苏两国的伟大友谊是更加巩固和发展了。我们深信，中苏两国之间伟大的牢不可破的友谊，不仅有助于我们两大国家的建设，而且是维护远东和世界和平不可战胜的力量。
    中苏两国的伟大友谊万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国人民最亲密的朋友、全世界人民的伟大导师斯大林同志万岁！
