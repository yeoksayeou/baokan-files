    Soviet Experts Help with the Design of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory
    Chao Qi
    Whenever the comrades working at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory talk about the achievements of the factory's construction, they always associate it with the name of Soviet expert Comrade Klimovsky, expressing their gratitude for his assistance in the design. I once attended a symposium at the factory to summarize the work. The attendees agreed on the following conclusion: If Comrade Klimovsky had not revised the preliminary design and provided guidance on the design concept, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory would inevitably have been an economically wasteful and technologically conservative factory.
    After understanding the entire design process and talking with some comrades who had participated in the design work, I realized that the above conclusion was very pertinent. The initial preliminary design of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory had been "scrapped," and the current factory was built according to the design revised by Comrade Klimovsky.
    According to the initial preliminary design, the factory buildings were laid out very loosely. The factory site covered an area of ​​two million square meters. The workshops were kept at a distance of more than 150 meters from each other, so that they would have room to expand by one time in the future. The medium forging workshop was placed two kilometers away from the factory site, for fear that the five-ton steam hammer would shake the metalworking workshop. Because the distance between the workshops was too far, all products had to be transported by rail. Therefore, the railway lines had to run through each workshop in a ring shape. The long railway line would increase the cost of factory construction. At the same time, in future production, whether it was transferring large or small, large or small quantities of workpieces, it would have to be done by train, and each time it would have to go through the shunting yard. The train would be constantly circling the factory day and night, which would greatly extend the delivery time of semi-finished products, increase product costs, and affect the increase in output. Although no one has calculated the detailed account, it is not difficult to imagine that day and night like this, the factory exists for a hundred years, and this unreasonable phenomenon will exist for a hundred years, and the waste must be very alarming. The revised design reduced the factory site area to more than 607,000 square meters, which is only one-third of the original; the area of ​​some excessively large factory buildings was also reduced, such as the metalworking workshop, which was originally designed to be 32,000 square meters, but was changed to 21,000 square meters. The factory buildings are laid out very compactly, with a distance of 30 meters for the closer workshops and 60 meters for the farther ones. There are seven parallel railways running from west to east in the factory, which are used to transport raw materials and products; the distance of several hundred meters from the medium forging workshop to the cast iron workshop is connected by outdoor overhead cranes. … These changes alone have greatly increased the connection in production and avoided a lot of waste.
    Comrade Klimovsky also appropriately revised the original design's product plan, workshop output, and equipment. Our engineers only started from subjective wishes when making the preliminary design. At that time, they stipulated that the factory should produce the following products: rolling mills with a roll diameter of 1,000 mm, 300-ton open-hearth furnaces and their main auxiliary equipment, 1,000 to 1,400-ton iron-smelting furnaces and their main auxiliary equipment, complete equipment for cement plants and ammonium sulfate plants, hydraulic presses below 5,000 tons, steam hammers below 20 tons, 30-foot gantry planers, overhead cranes from 10 tons to 400 tons, windlasses and drills above 500 horsepower, as well as turbine generator housings, large generator stators... The equipment is also the largest, and almost the largest equipment that can be found in books is listed, such as 10-meter vertical lathes, 20-meter large lathes, 50-foot gantry planers, 5,000-ton hydraulic presses, etc. The technical indicators adopted in the design are very conservative. The planned equipment for the medium forging workshop includes one 5,000-ton hydraulic press, one 10-ton, one 5-ton, and one 2.5-ton steam hammer, and five small air hammers, while its annual output is only determined to be 1,500 tons of forgings. If these equipment are fully utilized, according to Soviet indicators, the annual output can reach at least 20,000 tons of forgings. In this way, the management personnel and workers of the workshop can complete the task of 1,500 tons of forgings for the whole year in less than a month without any effort.
    In March 1951, when Comrade Klimovsky reviewed the preliminary design in Beijing, he criticized this erroneous design idea of ​​being too big and too much, and not meeting actual needs. He pointed out that factory design must adhere to two main principles: economic rationality and technological advancement. A heavy machinery factory is not an omnipotent machinery factory. This type of factory has not existed in history and will not exist in the future. He pointed out that the products in the preliminary design are all-encompassing, and their size and precision are too disparate, which will inevitably cause operational difficulties during production, and the equipment capacity will not be fully utilized (such as using a 75-ton crane to lift a 5-ton product, etc.). He said: It is best for a factory to carry out specialized production. However, our country was still in the period of economic recovery at that time, and a general-purpose heavy machinery factory was needed. The leadership agreed with Comrade Klimovsky's view and revised the preliminary design based on this point of view. At the same time, some adjustments were made to the production equipment. For example, the production capacity of the cast steel and cast iron workshops was too large. In addition to supplying the castings needed by the factory, there was still a large surplus capacity that could be used to manufacture heavy castings for other factories. Therefore, he added a primary processing workshop (the original design only had a metalworking workshop). And with the primary processing workshop as the center, he rearranged other workshops, reduced some unnecessary large equipment, and appropriately reduced the types of products.
    In the two and a half years of practice, the professional level of many designers has been improved; after ideological transformation movements and other political movements, the ideological level of many people has also been improved. Now, when people analyze why such a wrong preliminary design was made, they all believe that this is due to the too deep influence of bourgeois ideology in the past. In 1950, our country was still in the stage of economic recovery, and the leading organs could not put forward a specific product requirement. They only generally pointed out: It is hoped that this factory can basically manufacture heavy machinery that is needed domestically and cannot be manufactured by other factories. But what kind of heavy machinery is needed? How much is needed? The designers did not investigate. Among them, some studied in the United States, some studied in Germany, and some studied in the United Kingdom. They knew that there was a Krupp factory in Germany and an Allis-Chalmers factory in the United States. These two factories were gradually expanded with the development of capitalism, and their products were quite complex. Our designers had long been looking forward to the emergence of such a giant factory on the land of our country. When they accepted the design task of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory with great excitement, the shadows of Krupp and other factories floated in their minds. They had not yet recognized the superiority of our country's political and economic system, and could not see the great potential power of our country's working people. They believed that there would not be a second heavy machinery factory in China within ten years. At that time, there was a popular argument: "For example, when a poor woman makes clothes, the opportunity is rare, so she always has to make them bigger, so that she can wear them at ordinary times, and she can also wear them when she is pregnant and her belly is bigger." Therefore, people believed that this factory should become an "omnipotent factory." The design of each workshop was carried out separately, and everyone hoped that the workshop they designed would develop into an independent factory in the future. Engineer Cai Dehong recalled the situation at that time and said: "At that time, everyone could not find a complete set of data, and had no experience, but they felt that the design was very simple, as long as there were factory buildings and machines. Everyone looked for data in books to see what machines were the largest and what equipment was needed to manufacture these machines. Apart from this, they only considered one thing: whether the state's investment was enough to build such a large factory." In this way, in forty days, more than a dozen engineers produced a preliminary design for a new and complex factory. Errors also arose from here.
    The preliminary design revised by Comrade Klimovsky clearly demonstrated the superiority of socialist design thinking. It has a profound impact on our country's engineering and technical personnel. When engineer Zhuang Guoshen talked to me, he regretted that the time he spent in contact with Soviet experts was too short, and he had not fully understood the design intentions of the Soviet experts, so he encountered some problems that were not easy to solve during the technical design. However, he said: "Although I only had one day of contact with Comrade Klimovsky, he helped us reverse our erroneous design thinking." The guiding principles that design must be economically reasonable and technologically advanced have been consciously observed by the engineering and technical personnel of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory. In order to meet this requirement, many people actively learn Russian in order to read Soviet books and adopt Soviet advanced technology when carrying out technical design. Some people use the "look at pictures to recognize words" method to learn bit by bit; some people have spent a whole morning flipping through the Russian-Chinese dictionary to understand the explanation of a drawing, but they have not yet understood the meaning of three lines of words, but they are not discouraged. Engineer Zhuang Guoshen said: In some time, the task of "eliminating Russian illiteracy" can be completed among the technical personnel. In this way, people have gradually realized the advancement of Soviet science and technology in practice, and followed Chairman Mao's instructions to take the path of the Russians.

    苏联专家对太原重型机器厂设计的帮助
    超祺
    在太原重型机器厂工作的同志们，每次谈起建厂的成就时，都把它与苏联专家克林姆斯基同志的名字连在一起，感激他在设计方面的帮助。我曾经参加过该厂一个总结工作的座谈会。与会的人们都同意这样的一个结论：如果克林姆斯基同志不修改初步设计，不在设计思想上给予指导的话，太原重型机器厂必然会是一个在经济上十分浪费，在技术上十分保守的工厂。
    当我了解了整个设计过程，并和一些曾经参加设计工作的同志谈过话以后，更认识到上面的结论是十分中肯的。太原重型机器厂最初的那个初步设计已给“报废”了，现在的工厂是按照克林姆斯基同志修改过的设计建设的。
    根据最初的初步设计，厂房布置得很松散。厂址面积二百万平方公尺。车间与车间保持着一百五十公尺以上的距离，为的是让它们将来有扩充一倍的余地。中锻工车间摆在厂址以外两公里的地方，为的是怕五吨汽锤震动金工车间。由于车间之间的距离太远，产品必须全部靠铁路运输。因此，铁道线路就要贯串各个车间成为环形的了。铁路线长，就要增加工厂建设的成本。同时，将来在生产中，不论是传递大的或是较小的、数量多的或是数量较少的工作物，都得用火车，并且每运输一次都得经过调车场，火车将不息地日夜在厂内环行，这样就会大大延长半成品的运送时间，提高产品成本，影响产量的提高。虽然没有人算过细账，但不难想像，日日夜夜如此，工厂存在一百年，这个不合理的现象就存在一百年，其浪费一定是很惊人的。而修改后的设计，厂址面积缩小到六十万零七千多平方公尺，只相当于原来的三分之一；某些过大的厂房面积也缩小了，如金工车间原设计为三万二千平方公尺，改为二万一千平方公尺。厂房布置十分紧凑，车间与车间的距离，近的是三十公尺，远的是六十公尺。厂内自西而东有七道平行铁路，用来运输原料和产品；从中锻工车间到铸铁车间南北几百公尺长的距离，则靠室外空中大吊车来联系。……只这几项更动，就大大增加了生产中的联系，避免了很多浪费。
    克林姆斯基同志还适当地修改了原设计的产品方案、车间产量及设备。我们的工程师在作初步设计时，只从主观愿望出发。那时他们规定这个工厂生产以下几种产品：轧辊直径一千公厘的轧钢机，三百吨平炉及其主要附属设备，一千至一千四百吨的炼铁炉及其主要附属设备，水泥厂及硫酸錏厂的全部设备，五千吨以下的水压机，二十吨以下的蒸汽锤，三十呎龙门刨床，十吨到四百吨行车，五百匹马力以上的卷扬机、探钻机，还有透平发电机外壳、大发电机静子……。设备也是最大的，能在书本上找到的最大的设备几乎都被列出来了，如十公尺立车床，二十公尺大车床，五十呎龙门刨床，五千吨水压机，等等。而设计中采用的技术指数却十分保守。中锻工车间的计划设备有五千吨水压机一部，十吨、五吨、二吨半的蒸汽锤各一部，小空气锤五部，而它的年产量只确定为一千五百吨锻件。如果把这些设备充分加以利用，按照苏联指数计算，年产量至少可以达到二万吨锻件。这样，车间的管理人员和工人，不须经过什么努力，不到一个月就可以完成全年一千五百吨锻件的任务。
    一九五一年三月，克林姆斯基同志在北京审核初步设计时，批判了这种好大好多、不切合实际需要的错误设计思想。他指出工厂设计必须遵守两个主要原则：经济上的合理性和技术上的先进性。一个重型机器厂并不是万能机器厂，这种工厂在历史上没有，将来也不会有。他指出初步设计中的产品包罗万象，其大小精粗过于悬殊，必将造成生产时操作上的困难，设备能力将得不到充分利用（如以七十五吨吊车去吊五吨的产品等）。他说：一个工厂最好能进行专业生产。但是我国当时还处在经济刚恢复的时期，需要一个通用性的重型机器厂。领导方面同意克林姆斯基同志的这种看法，便根据这种观点修改了初步设计。同时，在生产设备方面进行了一些调整，如铸钢、铸铁车间的生产能力过大，除了供给本厂需要的铸件外，还有很大的剩余能力可以为别的工厂制造重型铸件，因此，他添了一个初加工车间（原设计只有金工车间）。并以初加工车间为中心，重新布置了其他车间，削减了一些不必要的大设备；同时适当地缩减了产品的种类。
    在两年半的实践过程中，许多设计人员的业务水平提高了；经过思想改造运动和其他政治运动，许多人的思想水平也提高了。现在，人们分析为什么会做出那样错误的初步设计时，都认为这是由于过去受资产阶级思想的影响太深。一九五○年，我国还处在经济开始恢复的阶段，领导机关还不可能提出一个具体的产品要求，只是一般地指出：希望这个工厂基本上能制造国内需要而别厂又不能制造的重型机器。但需要的是什么重型机器呢？需要多少呢？设计人员都没有调查。他们之中有留学美国的，有留学德国的和英国的。他们知道德国有个克虏伯工厂，美国有个阿力斯坎伯尔工厂。这两个工厂都是随着资本主义的发展而逐渐扩充起来的，产品相当复杂。我国的设计人员很早就憧憬着在我国的土地上会出现那样的巨型工厂。当他们以十分兴奋的心情接受太原重型机器厂的设计任务时，克虏伯等工厂的影子便在脑子里翻腾起来了。他们还没有认识我国政治制度和经济制度的优越性，看不见我国劳动人民的巨大潜在力量，认为十年之内中国不会有第二个重型机器厂。那时候流行着一种论调：“比如穷妇人做衣服，机会难逢，总要做得大一些，平时可以穿，怀了孕，肚子大了也可以穿。”因此，人们便认为这个工厂应当成为“万能工厂”。各个车间的设计又是单独进行的，每一个人都希望自己设计的车间，将来能发展为一个独立的工厂。蔡德洪工程师回忆当时的情景说：“那时大家找不到一份完整的资料，也没有经验，但又觉得设计很简单，只要有厂房和机器就成了。大家从书本上找资料，看看什么机器最大，制造这些机器需要什么设备。除此以外，只考虑一件事：国家的投资够不够建设这样大的工厂。”就这样，在四十天内，十几位工程师便把一个新型的复杂的工厂的初步设计搞出来了。错误也便从这里产生了。
    克林姆斯基同志修改后的初步设计，明显地表现了社会主义设计思想的优越性。对我国工程技术人员有着深刻影响。庄国绅工程师和我谈话的时候，很惋惜和苏联专家接触的时间太短，苏联专家的设计意图还没有完全领会，因此在技术设计时曾遇到一些不容易解决的问题。但是，他说：“虽然和克林姆斯基同志的接触只有一天，但他却帮助我们扭转了错误的设计思想。”设计必须经济上合理、技术上先进的指导原则，已被太原重型机器厂工程技术人员自觉地遵守了。为了达到这个要求，在进行技术设计时，许多人积极学习俄文，以便翻阅苏联书籍，采用苏联先进技术。有些人用“看图识字”的方法，一点一滴地学；有些人为了了解一个图样的说明，翻了一个上午的俄华字典还没弄清三行字的意思，但他们并不灰心。庄国绅工程师说：再过一些时候，在技术人员中就可以完成“扫除俄文文盲”的工作了。人们就是这样在实践中逐渐认识了苏联科学技术的先进性，依着毛主席的指示，走俄国人的道路。
