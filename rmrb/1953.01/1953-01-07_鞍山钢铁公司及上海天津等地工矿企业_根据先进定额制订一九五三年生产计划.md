Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company and over two hundred state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Shanghai have formulated their 1953 production plans on the basis of fulfilling their 1952 production increase and conservation tasks. State-owned and locally state-owned factories in Tianjin have essentially completed the work of formulating this year's production, financial, and technical plans.

In 1952, the various production plants and mines of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the state production plan by 12.58 percent and the production increase and conservation plan by 94.7 percent. Calculated at fixed prices, the total output value of Anshan Iron and Steel in 1952 increased by 44.1 percent compared to 1951. In order to strive for a new surge in production in the first year of the Five-Year Plan to support national economic construction, the various production plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel have formulated their 1953 production plans based on national requirements and the advanced quotas created in 1952.

State-owned and locally state-owned factories in Shanghai are actively formulating 1953 production plans in accordance with advanced production quotas. The state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, after overfulfilling its 1952 production increase and conservation task by 9.15 percent, has set a 1953 production plan that increases production by 46 percent compared to 1952. The factory has also decided to manufacture more than 80 new machines and train 294 engineers, technicians, and technical cadres above the level of workshop foreman in 1953 as a gift to the nation for the start of the first Five-Year Plan. After measuring its production capacity, the state-owned Shanghai Tool Factory has found that the efficiency of various machines has generally increased by three to ten times. The factory has now set a 1953 production plan that increases the actual output by 5.5 times compared to 1952. More than fifty textile and dyeing factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau overfulfilled their 1952 production increase and conservation plan by 4 percent. They have now put forward this year's production plan, which stipulates that yarn will increase by 14.83 percent compared to the actual output of 1952; cloth will increase by 12.04 percent; dyeing and printing will increase by 13.41 percent; and the amount of profit turned over to the state will increase by 28 percent.

This year's production tasks for state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Tianjin greatly exceed those of previous years. The plans formulated by the various factories all meet the state task targets, and some factories even exceed them. Compared with 1952, this year's state task for the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant has increased steel ingot production by 44 percent and steel products by 118 percent; and the plant's plan for this year exceeds the state task by 2.6 percent for steel ingot production and 9.3 percent for steel products. The total production volume planned for the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill this year will increase by about 34 percent compared to the actual output in 1952, exceeding this year's state task target by 10.12 percent. The planned output of yarn and cloth for the six state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin this year is higher than this year's state task, and the consumption of raw cotton is 1.28 percent lower than the state target. This fully demonstrates the further growth of the production capacity of state-owned factories.

The formulation of this year's plans by various factories in Tianjin is being carried out in conjunction with survey and assessment work. In addition to relying on technicians and workers above the fifth grade to study various planning indicators, the Tianjin Paper Mill also made use of the gaps in the survey and assessment to widely mobilize the masses to conduct discussions, ensuring the advanced nature and mass character of the plan. When the Tianjin Steel Plant handed the planning indicators to the masses for discussion, it focused on key issues in the work, mobilized all employees to find solutions, and as a result, the workers put forward 864 rationalization proposals for improving technology, enabling various planning indicators to exceed the state tasks and be higher than the intermediate progressive quota of 1952. For example, the steel smelting time stipulated in the plan is shortened by 30 minutes compared to the best production month in 1952. The start of the organization and compilation of technical measures plans is an important progress in the planning work of various factories. Because the requirements of the state plan and the results of the survey and assessment need to be reflected in this year's plan, various factories have generally compiled organizational and technical measures plans. In the survey and assessment, the Tianjin Water Supply Company found that using ferrous sulfate and sodium silicate instead of alum as a water purification agent can reduce the amount of alum used by more than half. The factory included this technical improvement in the plan, and preliminary calculations show that it can reduce the total cost by 5.5 percent.

    鞍山钢铁公司及上海天津等地工矿企业
    根据先进定额制订一九五三年生产计划
    据新华社讯：国营鞍山钢铁公司及上海市二百多个国营和地方国营工厂在完成一九五二年增产节约任务的基础上，已编制出一九五三年的生产计划。天津市国营和地方国营工厂已基本上完成了编制今年生产、财务、技术计划的工作。
    国营鞍山钢铁公司各生产厂矿一九五二年超额百分之十二点五八完成了国家生产计划，超额百分之九十四点七完成了增产节约计划。按照固定价格计算，一九五二年鞍钢的生产总值比一九五一年增长了百分之四十四点一。鞍钢各生产厂矿为了在五年计划开始的第一年中，争取生产上的新的高涨以支援全国经济建设，已根据国家的要求和一九五二年创造出来的先进定额制订了一九五三年的生产计划。
    上海市国营和地方国营工厂纷纷按照先进生产定额编制一九五三年生产计划。国营上海电机厂超额百分之九点一五完成了一九五二年的增产节约任务后，已订出比一九五二年增产百分之四十六的一九五三年生产计划。该厂并决定在一九五三年制造八十多种新机器，培养二百九十四个工程师、技术员和工段长以上的技术干部，作为对国家开始第一个五年计划的献礼。国营上海工具厂经过生产能力的测定，各种机器的效能已普遍提高三倍到十倍，现在，该厂已订出比一九五二年实际产量增加五点五倍的一九五三年生产计划。华东纺织管理局所属五十多个纺织、印染工厂超额百分之四完成了一九五二年的增产节约计划，现在他们已提出了今年的生产计划，其中规定纱比一九五二年的实际产量增加百分之十四点八三；布增加百分之十二点零四；印染增加百分之十三点四一；上缴国家的利润数字增加百分之二十八。
    天津市国营和地方国营工厂今年的生产任务大大超过往年，各厂编制的计划全部达到国家任务指标，部分工厂并且超过。国营天津钢厂今年的国家任务与一九五二年相比，钢锭产量提高了百分之四十四，钢材提高了百分之一百十八；而该厂今年编制的计划，钢锭产量又超过国家任务百分之二点六，钢材又超过百分之九点三。国营天津造纸厂今年计划的总生产量，较一九五二年实际产量增加百分之三十四左右，较今年国家任务指标超过百分之十点一二。天津六个国营棉纺织厂今年纱、布计划产量都较今年国家任务提高，原棉消耗量较国家指标降低百分之一点二八。这充分地显示出国营工厂生产能力的进一步增长。
    天津市各厂编制今年计划是与查定工作结合进行的。天津造纸厂除了依靠技术人员和五级以上工人研究了各项计划指标外，并利用查定的间隙普遍发动群众进行讨论，保证了计划的先进性和群众性。天津钢厂在把计划指标交给群众讨论时，针对工作中的关键提出课题，发动全厂职工找窍门，结果工人们共提出八百六十四件改进技术的合理化建议，使各种计划指标均超过国家任务，并高于一九五二年的中等累进定额，如计划中规定的钢的熔炼时间就比一九五二年生产最好的月份缩短三十分钟。组织技术措施计划的开始编制，是各厂计划工作的一个重要进展。由于国家计划要求和查定的成果需要反映到今年的计划中去，各厂普遍编制了组织技术措施计划。天津市自来水公司在查定中发现用硫酸亚铁和泡花碱代替明矾做净水剂，可以减少用矾量一半以上，该厂就将这一项技术改进列入计划，据初步计算可以使总成本降低百分之五点五。
