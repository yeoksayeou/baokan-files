    Materials Supply Department of Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Promotes and Enriches Huang Runping's Warehouse Management Method
    The materials supply departments under the Tianjin Railway Bureau have been promoting Huang Runping's warehouse management method since July of last year, and have made new additions to this management method.  Based on the implementation of the economic accounting system throughout the bureau, they have solidified the characteristics of Huang Runping's warehouse management method, such as being production-oriented and paying attention to conservation, in the form of systems and contracts.  They have also changed the organization of labor and promoted the planning of warehouse management work.
    Among the fifteen units in the first phase of key trials of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, twelve units were qualified, and three of them achieved excellent results.  A new atmosphere has now emerged in materials work, the chaos in warehouses has been clarified, and supply relationships have improved.  According to incomplete statistics, from July to December of last year, warehouses across the bureau sold off accumulated old and waste materials worth nearly 200 billion yuan.  After the implementation of this management method, the inventory quota was greatly compressed, the turnover of funds was accelerated, and the past view of looking down on warehouse work was changed for many people, establishing the idea of cherishing and valuing materials work.
    They have made the following additions to Huang Runping's warehouse management method:
    First, change the labor organization.  Each warehouse has established an independent contracting responsibility system, dividing into several contracting groups according to the nature of the materials used by the production unit, unifying planning, storage, and receiving and dispatching work.  In this way, the storekeeper no longer only does receiving, dispatching and storage work, but can actively allocate and dispatch materials according to the inventory and material usage plan, thereby reducing the accumulation of materials and overcoming the phenomenon of plans deviating from reality in the past.
    Second, the materials supply department and the production department sign mutual guarantee contracts.  The main contents are: (1) The workshop guarantees that the material usage plan submitted is accurate (referring to quantity and specifications), and that materials are received on time. (2) The warehouse guarantees to prepare materials in a timely manner after the workshop submits the material usage plan, and that the quantity is accurate and the quality is suitable. (3) The workshop guarantees to use as much stagnant, old, and waste materials as possible, and not to accumulate materials. (4) Problems are resolved through consultation between both parties. (5) Stipulate a system of receiving materials once every five or ten days, etc.
    In the past, workshops often budgeted too much for materials, or excessively emphasized the standard quality of materials; in addition, supply units did not actively purchase materials, and would not buy them until the workshop urgently needed them, or they one-sidedly purchased materials of poor quality in order to save funds, failing to cooperate with the actual needs of the workshop.  After the establishment of mutual guarantee contracts, these problems have been solved, making the material usage plan of the workshop and the supply plan of the warehouse accurate and timely, reducing the accumulation of materials and the waste of manpower and materials.  Some units have also developed mutual guarantee contracts into triangular contracts including the bank.  For example, after the Taiyuan Locomotive Depot signed a triangular contract, the supply between the two parties can be carried out without receipts, and the bank directly allocates funds, with the bank supervising both parties.  If the locomotive depot exceeds the material usage plan, the material factory may not supply; if the planned materials are not received, the bank will still allocate the material payment to the material factory according to the plan at the end of the month; the material factory guarantees timely supply and good quality to the locomotive depot, and will be fined if it fails to supply according to the contract stipulations.  The content of the contract implements the spirit of warehouse work being production-oriented, and also promotes the planning of warehouse work, as well as saving funds for the warehouse.
    Third, material personnel go deep into construction sites and sites to understand the processes and repair procedures, and grasp the progress of production, so as to supply materials in a timely manner and eliminate the phenomenon of work stoppage waiting for materials; and from the use of materials in the workshop, find out where materials can be saved.  Actively inform the workshop of the inventory situation, and promote stagnant, old, waste materials and substitutes.  The staff of the Shijiazhuang Materials Factory came up with a way to purchase materials directly from the market and send them directly to the site, eliminating the need for warehousing procedures and accelerating the turnover of funds.
    In order to consolidate the gains already made and exchange experiences, the bureau held an exchange of experiences conference on the promotion of Huang Runping's warehouse management method in mid-December of last year.  The Beijing Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions both sent working groups to participate.  Huang Runping also participated in the meeting with the working group.

    天津铁路管理局材料供应部门
    推行并充实了黄润萍仓库管理法
    天津铁路管理局所属各材料供应部门，从去年七月起推行黄润萍仓库管理法，并且对这一管理法作了新的补充。他们在全局推行经济核算制的基础上，把黄润萍仓库管理法中面向生产、注意节约等特点，用制度与合同的形式固定起来，并且改变了劳动组织，促进了仓库管理工作的计划性。
    天津铁路管理局在第一期重点试行的十五个单位中，合格的有十二个单位，其中三个单位成绩优良。现在材料工作已出现了一片新气象，仓库中的紊乱现象澄清了，供应关系改善了。据不完全的统计，从去年七月到十二月，全局各地仓库推销积压的旧废材料，其价值将近两千亿元。推行这一管理法后，大大地压缩了库存定量，加速了资金周转，并且改变了许多人过去瞧不起仓库工作的思想，树立了爱护和重视材料工作的思想。
    他们对黄润萍仓库管理法作了以下补充：
    第一，改变劳动组织。各仓库建立了独立包干负责制度，按照生产单位用料的性质，分成几个包干组，把计划、保管、收发工作统一起来。这样，保管员不再只是做收发、保管工作，而能根据库存和用料计划，主动调料、发料，所以减少了材料的积压，克服了过去计划脱离实际的现象。
    第二，材料供应部门和生产部门签订互保合同。内容主要是：（一）车间保证提出的用料计划要准确（指数量和规格），而且按时领料。（二）仓库保证车间提出用料计划后及时准备材料，而且数量准确，质量合用。（三）车间保证尽量使用呆料、旧料、废料，不积压材料。（四）有问题双方协商解决。（五）规定五天或十天领料一次等制度。
    过去车间预算材料往往预算过多，或者过分强调材料标准质量；另外，供应单位买料也不主动，非等车间急用时不买，或者片面地为了节约资金，不配合车间实际需要，购买质量不好的材料。订立互保合同后，这些问题都解决了，使车间的用料计划和仓库的供应计划准确及时，减少了材料的积压和人力物力的浪费。有的单位还把互保合同发展为连银行在内的三角合同。如太原机务段订立三角合同后，双方供应就可不用票据，而由银行直接划拨，银行对双方实行监督。如果机务段超过用料计划，材料厂可以不供应；如果计划的材料不领用，银行到月终仍照计划把料款拨付材料厂；材料厂对机务段则保证及时供应，质量良好，如不按合同规定时间供应就罚款。合同的内容，贯彻了仓库工作面向生产的精神，而且促使仓库工作做到有计划，还使仓库节约了资金。
    第三，材料人员深入工地、现场，了解工序、修理程序，掌握生产进度，以便及时供应材料，消灭停工待料现象；并从车间使用材料的情况，找出可以节约材料的地方。主动的使车间了解库存情况，推销呆料、旧料、废料和代用品。石家庄材料厂职工们想出办法，在市场购买材料直接送到现场，免去入库手续，加速了资金周转。
    为了巩固已得的成绩和交流经验，该局在去年十二月中旬曾举行了推广黄润萍仓库管理法的交流经验大会。北京市爱国增产节约竞赛委员会和北京市总工会都派了工作组前往参加。黄润萍也随工作组参加了这次会议。
