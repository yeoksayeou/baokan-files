    The Central Ministry of Internal Affairs Decides to Strengthen Political Education Work for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers

    Editor: The reader's suggestion "We Should Care About the Political Progress of Military Dependents" published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 3, 1953, was very good. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, governments at all levels have generally attached importance to this work and have achieved some success. Many families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents cherish their honor and actively participate in various political activities, and have been elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels and members of people's governments at all levels. For example, in thirty counties in the provinces of Liaodong and Songjiang, among the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, 67 were elected as representatives to the provincial people's congresses, 3,428 were elected as representatives to the county and district people's congresses, and 17,506 were elected as representatives to the village people's congresses. 10,077 served as members of people's governments at all levels and administrative cadres. Many provinces and counties regularly hold representative conferences of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers every year, and hold army-civilian get-togethers and symposiums for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers during the "August 1st" Army Day and the Spring Festival to conduct appropriate political education for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In particular, since the launch of the campaign to evaluate model families receiving preferential treatment, the political awareness of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has been further improved, and many of them have been selected as models. However, it cannot be denied that we have not done this work deeply, universally, and regularly enough, especially lacking in-depth inspection, and have not raised concern for the political progress of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to the proper level. Therefore, many families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers still have some backward ideas, especially in areas that were liberated later. This not only reduces their honor, but also affects the morale of the troops. Therefore, we must pay special attention to this issue in the future. In the 1953 work of providing preferential treatment, strengthening the political and ideological education of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers will be a major component, and effective measures will be taken, such as: strengthening ideological education for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers on a regular basis; making the campaign to evaluate model families receiving preferential treatment a regular system, etc., to completely change this phenomenon. We are studying the methods used by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau in running political study classes for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and plan to promote them in areas with conditions in large and medium-sized cities.

### 中央内务部决定加强烈军属政治教育工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央内务部决定加强烈军属政治教育工作
    编辑同志：一九五三年一月三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了关于“应该关心军属政治上的进步”的读者建议。我们认为这个建议很好。自抗美援朝运动开展以来，各级人民政府对这一工作一般还是重视的，并且也取得一些成绩。不少烈属、军属珍爱自己的光荣，积极的参加各种政治活动，被选为各级人民代表会议的代表和各级人民政府的委员。如辽东和松江两省三十个县的烈军属、革命残废军人和复员军人中，有六十七人当选为省人民代表会议的代表，有三千四百二十八人当选为县、区人民代表会议的代表，有一万七千五百零六人当选为村人民代表会议的代表，担任各级人民政府委员和行政干部的有一万零七十七人。许多省、县每年都定期召开烈军属代表会议，并在每年的“八一”建军节和春节等期间召开军民联欢会和烈军属座谈会，对烈军属进行适当的政治教育。特别是自从评选优抚模范运动开展以来，烈军属的政治觉悟有了进一步的提高，他们有许多人被选为烈军属模范。但也不能否认，我们对这一工作确实做的还不够深入、普遍和经常，特别是缺乏深入的检查，对关心烈军属政治上的进步，还没有提到应有的地位，因此有不少烈军属还存在着一些落后的思想，特别在解放较晚的地区，这不但减低了他们的荣誉，也影响到部队的情绪。因此，我们今后一定要特别注意这个问题，在一九五三年的优抚工作中，加强烈军属的政治思想教育将作为一项主要内容，并将采取有效措施，如：平日加强对烈军属的思想教育；把评选优抚模范运动形成经常制度等，以彻底改变这种现象，北京市人民政府民政局举办烈军属、革命残废军人政治学习班的办法，我们正在研究，计划在大中城市有条件的地区进行推广。 中央人民政府内务部
