Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: The British government has openly stated that it will continue to support the American aggression in Korea, and it makes no secret of its hostility toward the Chinese people. According to the British Information Service, British Foreign Secretary Eden, in response to questions in the British House of Commons on the 21st regarding the Korean situation, said that because the Indian proposal supporting the United States' unreasonable demands on the POW issue was opposed by the Korean and Chinese sides, the British government had "abandoned hope for an early armistice." He said, "The British government's policy will remain unchanged." He admitted that the British government will continue to support the American aggression in Korea and adhere to the so-called "principles" that Britain has previously stated.

According to Agence France-Presse, Eden publicly stated in the House of Commons on the same day that "past British governments and the current British government have maintained the view" that the seat in the United Nations Security Council currently occupied by the Kuomintang bandit gang is "impossible to change." Eden's words nakedly exposed the British government's ugly two-faced attitude. On the one hand, it claimed to have established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, but on the other hand, it was determined from beginning to end to follow its American master, support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and deliberately antagonize the Chinese people. Many facts show that the British government is continuing to play the role of a top accomplice, actively participating in the conspiracy of the American aggressors to carry out military adventures in the Far East.

The British government not only agrees to the United States continuing and expanding the war of aggression in Korea, but is also prepared to send more British youth to serve as cannon fodder for Wall Street. According to the "Washington Star" on December 11th last year, Britain has informally expressed its willingness to transfer another division of troops from West Germany to Korea. British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald, British Deputy Commander of the Far East Navy Clifford, and the British authorities in Hong Kong, earlier this month, discussed "issues related to the US military blockade of the Chinese mainland" with Chase, the head of the US military advisory group stationed in Taiwan. Following MacDonald, Guy Russell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Naval Base, also went to Hong Kong to carry out activities. The "cooperation" between the British and American air forces in the South China Sea has also recently been further strengthened.

The British government's actions of aiding and abetting the enemy are bound to be strongly opposed by the British people. British Labour Party MP Shinwell admitted on the 17th that any proposal to intensify or even expand the Korean War "will certainly not be approved by the British public." All these perverse actions of the British government prove that it is not only the ferocious enemy of the Korean and Chinese people, but also of the British people.

### 积极参与美国远东军事冒险活动  英政府继续充当美国头号帮凶

    积极参与美国远东军事冒险活动
    英政府继续充当美国头号帮凶
    【新华社二十三日讯】英国政府公然表示要继续支持美国侵略朝鲜，并且毫不掩饰它对于中国人民的敌意。据英国新闻处报道，英国外交大臣艾登二十一日在英国下议院中答复关于朝鲜局势的质询时说，由于支持美国在遣俘问题上的无理主张的印度提案遭到朝中方面的反对，英国政府已经“放弃早日停战的希望”。他说，“英国政府的政策依然不会改变。”他承认，英国政府将继续支持美国侵略朝鲜，并坚持英国所曾经表明的所谓“原则”。
    另据法新社报道，艾登同一天在下议院中公开声称，“过去的英国政府和现在的英国政府都保持这样的一种看法”，即联合国安全理事会中目前国民党匪帮所窃据的席位是“不可能改变的”。艾登的这些话，赤裸裸地暴露了英国政府丑恶的两面态度，一方面它虽然声称与中华人民共和国建交，另一方面却自始至终决心追随它的美国主子，支持蒋介石匪帮，蓄意与中国人民为敌。许多事实表明，英国政府正在继续扮演头号帮凶的角色，积极参与美国侵略者在远东进行军事冒险的阴谋活动。
    英国政府不但同意美国继续和扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，并且准备拿更多的英国青年去给华尔街充当炮灰。据“华盛顿明星报”在去年十二月十一日报道，英国已非正式表示愿意从西德再抽调一师部队到朝鲜去。英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳，英国驻远东海军副司令克利弗德以及香港的英国当局，在本月初曾经和美国派在台湾的军事顾问团团长蔡斯商谈“有关美军封锁中国大陆的问题”。紧跟在麦克唐纳之后，英国远东海军基地总司令盖·鲁塞尔又到香港进行活动。英美空军在南中国海上的“合作”最近也在进一步加强。
    英国政府这种为虎作伥的行为，必然要遭到英国人民的强烈反对。英国工党议员辛威尔十七日承认，任何想要加紧甚至扩大朝鲜战争的意见，“英国公众是一定不赞成的”。英国政府的这一切倒行逆施，证明它不仅是朝中人民的而且是英国人民的凶恶的敌人。
