Xinhua News Agency, London, January 2nd: According to TASS, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, analyzed the situation in Britain and put forward the British Communist Party's policies in a recently published pamphlet entitled "What Should Be the Policy of the Working Class?". Pollitt wrote: 1952 was marked by high prices, huge profits for capitalists, rejection of workers' demands for wage increases, and a general decline in living standards. Pollitt pointed out that Britain's domestic and foreign markets are shrinking, while the United States has deprived it of the right to export goods to socialist countries. This is why unemployment in Britain has increased in the past year. Pollitt pointed out that the Korean War is still going on, and British imperialism has no power to conquer the Malayan people who are fighting for national independence. The burden of accelerated armament imposed on Britain by the United States is undermining the British economy, and the ban on British trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies deprives Britain of the possibility of selling its heavy industrial products at the most favorable prices.

Pollitt put forward the following propositions of the Communist Party as the basis for the broad unity of the British workers' movement now.

Domestic policy: Increase wages with the rise in prices, increase unemployment benefits, increase pensions and war disability benefits. Reduce grain prices by restoring government subsidies. Use manpower, materials and financial resources to build large numbers of houses, schools and hospitals. All medical facilities are free of charge. Turn the main economic sectors over to the people. Renationalize all companies returned to private hands without any compensation, and workers take over the positions of managers in nationalized enterprises.

Foreign policy: In order to realize these propositions, it is necessary to abandon the foreign policy imposed on Britain by the United States. Britain should develop trade between East and West, reduce armaments, conclude a five-power peace pact, and withdraw British troops from Korea, Malaya, Kenya, and Egypt. The rule of the United States in Britain should be ended.

Pollitt said that bacteriological warfare, atomic bombs, and hydrogen bombs must be banned. He stressed that the US government has shown in Korea and Germany that it is unwilling to conduct genuine negotiations. Therefore, the more than 600 million signatures collected worldwide for the declaration of a five-power peace pact are of special significance. These signatures reflect the will of the vast majority of people in the world. Pollitt called for increased pressure on the governments of capitalist countries to achieve the goal of concluding a five-power peace pact.

Regarding the colonial wars waged by imperialism, Pollitt wrote that the people of the colonies cannot be conquered, and their struggle for national independence is inseparable from the British people's struggle against American interference in British affairs.

Pollitt stressed that the British people are in great danger due to the establishment of atomic bomber bases by the United States in Britain. He wrote that now is the time for the British government to adopt an independent policy based on the interests of the British people. This policy is that Britain is ready to cooperate with all countries and will not allow any country to reduce it to a dependent position.

    英共总书记波立特发表对内对外政策文件
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二日讯：英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特在新近出版的小册子“工人阶级的政策应该是怎样的”中分析了英国的形势并提出英国共产党的政策。波立特写道：一九五二年是以物价高涨、资本家获得庞大的利润、劳动者增加工资的要求遭到拒绝和生活水平普遍下降为标志的一年。波立特指出，英国的国内国外市场日渐缩小，而美国却剥夺了它向社会主义国家输出货物的权利。这就是为什么最近一年以来英国失业人数增加的原因。波立特指出，朝鲜战争仍在继续着，英帝国主义没有力量征服为民族独立而斗争的马来亚人民。美国强加给英国的加紧武装的负担破坏了英国的经济，而禁止英国同苏联、中国和人民民主国家进行贸易，剥夺了英国以最有利的价格出卖它的重工业品的可能。
    波立特提出共产党的下列主张，作为现在英国工人运动广泛团结的基础。
    对内政策：随物价的上涨提高工资，增加失业补助金，增加养老金和战争残废补助金。用恢复政府补助的办法降低粮价。利用人力、物力和财力建筑大批房屋、学校和医院。各种医疗设施一律免费。把主要经济部门交给人民。把一切发还私人的公司重新收归国有而不给以任何赔偿，由工人接替国有化企业中经理的职位。
    对外政策：为了实现这些主张，必须放弃美国强加给英国的外交政策。英国应该发展东西方之间的贸易，裁减军备，缔结五大国和平公约，从朝鲜、马来亚、怯尼亚和埃及撤退英国军队。应当结束美国在英国的统治。
    波立特说，必须禁止细菌战、原子弹和氢弹。他着重指出，美国政府在朝鲜和德国问题上表现出它是不愿意进行真正的谈判的。因此，全世界为缔结五大国和平公约宣言所征集的六亿多人的签名，具有特殊的意义。这些签名反映了全世界绝大多数人民的意志。波立特号召对资本主义国家的政府加强压力，以达到缔结五大国和平公约的目的。
    波立特就帝国主义所进行的殖民战争写道，殖民地的人民并不能被征服，他们为民族独立所进行的斗争是和英国人民反对美国干涉英国事务的斗争不可分割的。
    波立特着重指出：英国人民由于美国在英国建立原子轰炸机的基地而担受极大的危险。他写道，现在已是英国政府采取以英国人民利益为出发点的独立的政策的时候了。这种政策就是，英国准备和一切国家合作，不容许任何一个国家把它降到依附的地位。
