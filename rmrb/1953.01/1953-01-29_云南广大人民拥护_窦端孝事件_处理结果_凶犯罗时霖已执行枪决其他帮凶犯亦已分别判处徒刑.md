The correct handling of the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" by the Party and government leading organs of Yunnan Province has been warmly supported by the broad masses of Yunnan Province. Now, the murderer Luo Shilin has been executed by firing squad according to law, and other accomplices have also received the legal sanctions they deserve.

On January 5th, the People's Court of Luxi County held a trial, publicly announcing the verdict of the Provincial People's Court and executing the counter-revolutionary element Luo Shilin by firing squad. At the same time, He Keqin (the wife of the murderer Luo Shilin), who had consistently shielded her counter-revolutionary husband and helped in the assault, was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a reprieve; Zhao Bingtai, an accomplice who followed the instructions of the counter-revolutionary Luo Shilin and barbarously stuffed a chicken neck into Comrade Dou Duanxiao's vagina, and Sheng Yongchang, an accomplice who provided the counter-revolutionary Luo Shilin with a strong laxative, causing great harm to Comrade Dou Duanxiao, were each sentenced to three years imprisonment. That afternoon, more than 7,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Luxi County gathered to publicly mourn Comrade Dou Duanxiao, who was murdered by counter-revolutionary elements.

After the relevant decisions of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yunnan Provincial People's Government on handling the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" were announced, Party branches, administrative units, and the masses in many organs, organizations, factories, and schools in Yunnan Province conducted study and discussions. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Yiliang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China arranged for the county Party committees to study seriously these decisions on the same day they were announced (January 4th). The General Branch of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government also arranged for the branches to conduct study and discussions on the same day. The workers of the No. 9 Group of the Yarn Reeling Section of the Yunnan Textile Factory continued to discuss until the factory lights were turned off. Li Jiabao, Chen Lifa, and other eleven comrades who were recuperating in the Kunming Municipal Hospital also held discussions on these decisions despite their illness. The broad masses unanimously believe that the handling of this incident by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government is correct and fully meets the demands of the people, and thus feel even more the greatness, glory, and correctness of the Party.

The broad masses of cadres and people throughout the province have received a great education from the "Dou Duanxiao Incident" and have all expressed that they will accept the painful lessons of the "Dou Duanxiao Incident," strengthen the political and ideological nature of their work, strengthen organizational discipline, strengthen revolutionary vigilance, and do a good job in work and production to adapt to large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. All the members of the Fourth Branch of the General Branch of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce of the Communist Party of China examined the shortcomings of lacking political ideology and having paralysis of thought in their past work during their studies and were determined to do the work assigned by the Party and the people well. All the workers of Ni Wenhui Group of the Yunnan Iron Factory said: At present, the Party and Chairman Mao are calling on us to carry out patriotic production competitions. We must be vigilant at all times, do a good job in factory defense work to prevent accidents; we must constantly strengthen political and technical studies, and take practical actions in production to combat the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries so that the production competition can be carried out smoothly and contribute more to the country's large-scale economic construction. The peasant representatives of the People's Congress of all ethnic groups in Luxi County also examined their ideas of numbness and relaxation, and expressed that they would improve their vigilance, strictly control landlords, prevent the destruction of remaining hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement to do a good job in production. The broad masses of young people expressed that they would learn from Comrade Dou Duanxiao's spirit of loving the motherland and resolutely fighting against the enemy, and adhere to principles and truth in their work.

After the Yunnan Daily published the relevant decisions of the Provincial Party Committee, etc., and an editorial, it received letters from the broad masses of readers supporting the correct handling of the Party and the People's Government and expressing their determination to accept this lesson and do a good job in their work and production. From January 4th to 14th, the newspaper received 171 letters from 1,143 readers, which have been published separately or comprehensively.

    凶犯罗时霖已执行枪决其他帮凶犯亦已分别判处徒刑
    云南省党、政领导机关对“窦端孝事件”的正确处理，受到云南省广大群众的热烈拥护。现在，凶犯罗时霖已依法执行枪决，其他从犯也受到了应有的法律制裁。
    一月五日，泸西县人民法庭开庭，依据省人民法院的判决公审和枪决了反革命分子罗时霖。同时，并依法对一贯包庇其反革命丈夫、帮助行凶的贺可钦
    （凶犯罗时霖的妻子）判处有期徒刑三年，缓期执行；对听从反革命分子罗时霖指使、野蛮地将鸡脖子塞进窦端孝同志阴户的帮凶犯赵炳泰，供给反革命分子罗时霖强烈泻剂、惨害窦端孝同志的帮凶犯盛永昌各判处有期徒刑三年。当天下午，泸西县各族各界人民七千余人集会，公祭了被反革命分子残杀的窦端孝同志。
    中共云南省委和云南省人民政府处理“窦端孝事件”的有关决定公布后，云南省许多机关、团体、工厂、学校中的党支部、行政单位以及人民群众都进行了学习讨论。中共宜良地委根据省委的指示，在这些决定公布的当天（一月四日）就布置各县党委认真学习。中共云南省委直属机关总支、中共云南省人民政府直属机关党委会也在当天布置各支部进行学习讨论。云南纺织厂摇纱科第九小组的工人同志一直到工厂熄灯时还在继续讨论。在昆明市立医院养病的李嘉保、陈礼发等十一个同志也带病对这些决定进行了座谈。广大群众一致认为中共云南省委、省人民政府对这一事件的处理是正确的，完全符合人民的要求，因而更感到了党的伟大、光荣和正确。
    全省广大机关干部和人民群众从“窦端孝事件”中受到了很大的教育，都表示要接受“窦端孝事件”的沉痛教训，加强工作中的政治性、思想性，加强组织性纪律性，加强革命警惕性，搞好工作和生产，以适应大规模的经济建设和文化建设。中共云南省商业厅总支第四支部全体党员，在学习中检查了过去工作中缺乏政治思想性和有麻痹思想的缺点，决心把党和人民交给的工作做好。云南铁工厂倪文惠小组全体工人说：目前党和毛主席号召我们开展爱国生产竞赛，我们要时时刻刻提高警惕，做好工厂保卫工作，以防发生事故；要不断加强政治、技术学习，在生产上以实际行动来打击反革命的阴谋，使生产竞赛顺利地进行，为祖国大规模经济建设贡献更大的力量。泸西县各族各界人民代表会议的农民代表们也纷纷检查了自己的麻痹松劲思想，表示今后要提高警惕性，严格管制地主，防止残余的暗藏的反革命分子破坏，开展互助合作运动，搞好生产。广大的青年更表示要学习窦端孝同志热爱祖国、坚决与敌人斗争的精神，在工作中坚持原则，坚持真理。
