Tianjin Architectural Design Company

Focuses on Inspecting Engineering Design Work

Criticizing Incorrect Design Views and Work Attitudes

[This newspaper reported] The Architectural Design Company, under the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, has seriously summarized the problems and experiences in past design work by focusing on inspecting engineering design work. Many engineers and technicians have been further educated through the summary work and have begun to criticize incorrect design views and work attitudes of the past.

The leadership of the company required that this summary should: reflect problems, summarize experiences, and raise and solve problems. To this end, in addition to requiring the study and analysis of past design views from the inspected materials to improve the ideological understanding of employees, it also required the compilation of reference materials for the design of various projects based on the results of this inspection. Some groups were also given specific focuses for their summary work. For example, some groups focused on summarizing the issue of technicians mastering budgeting, while others focused on summarizing advanced experience.

After the inspection began, each group raised many problems and conducted detailed discussions on each of the hundreds of unreasonable phenomena in engineering design that had been identified by their respective groups. During the discussions, some groups also engaged in heated debates on some fundamental issues. The summaries written by each group were generally very detailed and contained substantial content.

In the process of summarizing, most groups criticized various errors that existed in past design work and further clarified the seriousness of these errors. First, they found that due to the serious irresponsibility of the company and relevant design departments and designers, some projects were almost constructed without any design, resulting in irreparable losses. For example, in the case of the Local State-Owned Industry Bureau’s Architectural Model Machine Factory, the blueprints designed by the owner themselves were not approved by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government and were redesigned by the design company. The relevant technical personnel of the company were very irresponsible and simply redrew the blueprints according to the owner's original design without conducting any investigation, research, or design work, and without considering the factory's development and safe production issues, which resulted in many serious defects in the project. Second, the summary revealed that some designers never considered the needs of users and owners in their work, resulting in many inconveniences for the owners and users in the designed projects. For example, the company's design of the Liulitai People's Bank dormitory, which accommodates more than 1,500 people, was extremely inadequate in its consideration of public facilities. The company's design of fourteen wineries for a certain winery lacked any safety equipment, and these wineries were designed in the middle of factories, offices, and dormitories, which would threaten the safety of the entire factory in the event of an explosion. In addition, some designers considered the aesthetics and solidity of the project more, but did not consider actual needs and savings, resulting in a large waste of state resources. For example, the designers responsible for the design of the pier for mooring yachts at the Second Workers' Cultural Palace did not conduct a good investigation and research in advance, and designed the yacht pier as the same project as the pier for mooring ships. Furthermore, the Liulitai People's Bank dormitory, due to poor design, resulted in a waste of 3.7 billion yuan, according to the estimated twelve major problems that caused waste.

Through preliminary analysis and summary, many engineers and technicians of the company have received a relatively deep and specific education and have begun to criticize incorrect design views and work attitudes of the past. For example, engineer Wang Yayuan said: "In the past, when engaging in ideological remolding, I always felt that the education received was not specific. This time, after carefully investigating and studying the problems of the project, the facts are very clear, and I truly feel the importance of the design staff's own responsibilities." Some engineers realized that adding or subtracting a line on the drawing by the designers would cause irreparable losses on the project, therefore, they must be serious and responsible when working, and cannot be careless and perfunctory. However, some individual technicians still cannot face their own shortcomings and mistakes in the summary. The company's leadership should continue to strengthen ideological leadership and mobilize technical personnel to further improve their ideological and professional level in order to better complete future design tasks.

    天津市建筑设计公司
    重点检查工程设计工作
    批判了不正确的设计观点和工作态度
    【本报讯】天津市建筑工程局所属建筑设计公司，通过重点检查工程设计工作，认真总结过去设计工作中的问题和经验。许多工程师及技术人员从总结工作中进一步受到了教育，并开始批判了过去不正确的设计观点和工作态度。
    该公司领导方面对此次总结的要求是：能反映问题，总结经验，并提出问题，解决问题。为此，除要求从检查出的材料中，研究、分析出过去的各种设计观点，以提高职工的思想认识外，还要求根据此次检查结果，分别整理出设计各种工程的参考资料。对有些组还提出了总结工作的重点。如有的组专门总结技术人员掌握预算问题，有的组专门总结先进经验问题等。
    检查开始后，各组都提出了很多问题，并对本组检查出来的一百条至几百条的工程设计中的不合理现象，逐条展开了详细的讨论。在讨论中，有的小组并对一些原则性的问题，展开热烈的争论。各小组写出的总结，一般都很详细，内容比较充实。
    在总结过程中，大部小组批判了过去设计工作中所存在的各种错误，并进一步明确认识了这些错误的严重性。首先，他们发现由于该公司及有关设计部门和设计人员严重的不负责任，有的工程几乎等于没有设计即行施工，以致造成不可挽救的损失。如地方国营工业局建筑示范机器厂时，业主自己设计的蓝图，未被天津市人民政府批准，改由设计公司重新设计。该公司有关的技术人员非常不负责任，竟按照业主原来设计的蓝图重绘了一遍，未做任何调查、研究及设计工作，没有考虑到该厂的发展及安全生产等问题，以致工程产生了许多严重缺点。其次，总结中发现有的设计人员在工作中，从不为用户及业主着想，因而在设计出的工程中，使业主及用户感到许多不便。如该公司设计的容纳一千五百余人的六里台人民银行宿舍，对公共设备问题考虑极不周密。该公司替某酒厂设计的十四个酒库，没有任何安全设备，而且这些酒库设计在厂房、办公室及宿舍中间，这样，万一酒库发生爆炸，就威胁到全厂的安全。另外，有些设计人员考虑工程的美观、坚固较多，但不考虑实际需要及节约问题，以致造成国家资财的大量浪费。如负责设计第二工人文化宫停泊游船的码头的设计人员，事先未进行很好的调查研究，竟把游船码头设计成和停泊轮船的码头一样的工程。又如六里台人民银行宿舍由于设计不周，根据发现的十二个造成浪费的主要问题估计，浪费即达三十七亿元。
    通过初步的分析、总结，该公司许多工程师和技术人员都受到了比较深刻、具体的教育，开始批判了过去不正确的设计观点和工作态度。如工程师王亚元说：“过去搞思想改造，总感觉接受教育不具体，这回仔细调查、研究了工程的毛病，事实摆得很清楚，才真正感觉到了设计人员本身责任的重大。”有的工程师认识到：设计人员在图上多划一道或少划一道，就会造成工程上不可挽救的损失，因此，工作时必须严肃负责，不能粗枝大叶、草率敷衍。但是，个别技术人员在总结中还不能正视自己的缺点和错误。该公司领导方面应继续加强思想领导工作，发动技术人员进一步提高思想水平和业务水平，以便更好地完成今后的设计任务。
