Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th — The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps, Air Defense Forces, and Korean railway workers have together achieved significant results in performing anti-bombing, repairing, and transporting tasks. They have not only met the supply needs of our army on the Korean battlefield, but have also powerfully guaranteed the completion of the Korean people's economic transportation plan.

According to incomplete statistics, from November 1950 to September 1952, the North Korean railway lines were bombed by enemy aircraft more than 17,700 times, with enemy aircraft dropping a total of about 30,000 tons of bombs. In 1952, the number of times enemy aircraft bombed the railway lines increased many times compared to 1951, but the efficiency of railway transportation in North Korea increased by more than five times.

At the end of 1952, Kim Hwang-il, Vice Minister of the Railway Department of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps, saying: "You have displayed a lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism on the railway transportation front, not only meeting the needs of the front line, but also ensuring that the 1952 Korean People's Economic Transportation Plan was fully completed on December 23, 1952. I express my warm greetings and thanks to the comrades!" The telegram also wished all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps even greater victories in completing the glorious tasks of 1953.

In the arduous struggle on the Korean railway transportation front, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps displayed an incomparably heroic and tenacious fighting spirit. In the six months from February to July 1952, they removed more than 4,000 time bombs dropped by enemy aircraft along the railway lines. On July 10 alone, they removed more than 700 time bombs.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps launched a wide-ranging rationalization proposal movement, leveraging the wisdom of everyone, which played an extremely important role in defeating enemy aircraft bombing and completing arduous transportation tasks. In early 1952, enemy aircraft carried out a so-called "strangulation warfare" against the vital areas of our railway transportation, causing serious damage in some sections. However, thanks to the new method of rapidly filling bomb craters created by the repair troops, the construction time was reduced by two-thirds, ensuring timely traffic. When bombs bent the steel rails on the railway, the fighters of the repair troops devised various ways to straighten the rails. A certain company's second platoon created a record of straightening 214 rails in one day, but another unit adopted a more scientific assembly line method, enabling eight people to straighten 55 rails in eight hours.

The inventions and creations of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps are astonishing. A certain regiment had more than 100 rationalization proposals in one year. Among them was the "exploration shovel" created by Company Commander Liu Min, which can detect cracks on steel rails at night; and the "re-railing device" created by the commanders and fighters of the 11th Company, which can pull derailed train cars back onto the tracks. According to statistics from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps, one-third of the more than 500 personnel who were awarded merit were awarded for rationalization proposals and inventions.

### 志愿军铁道部队和防空部队  执行反轰炸、抢修、抢运任务有重大成绩

    执行反轰炸、抢修、抢运任务有重大成绩
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】中国人民志愿军铁道部队、防空部队和朝鲜铁路员工一起执行反轰炸、抢修、抢运的任务，已有重大成绩。他们不仅满足了朝鲜战场上我军供应的需要，并且有力地保证了朝鲜人民经济运输计划的完成。
    据不完全统计，从一九五零年十一月到一九五二年九月，北朝鲜铁道线遭敌机轰炸达一万七千七百多处次，敌机投弹总数约三万多吨。在一九五二年，敌机在铁道线上轰炸的处次数比一九五一年增加了好多倍，但是，北朝鲜的铁道运输效率却提高了五倍以上。
    在一九五二年底，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁铁道省副相金黄一打电报给志愿军铁道部队全体指挥员、战斗员说：“你们在铁道运输战线上发扬了崇高的爱国主义与国际主义精神，不但满足了前线的需要、而且使一九五二年度朝鲜人民经济运输计划在一九五二年十二月二十三日全部完成。我对同志们表示热烈的慰问和谢意！”电报最后并预祝志愿军铁道部队全体指挥员、战斗员在完成一九五三年的光荣任务中取得更加伟大的胜利。
    在朝鲜铁道运输战线上的艰巨斗争中，志愿军铁道部队的指挥员、战斗员们发扬了无比英勇顽强的战斗精神。他们从一九五二年二月到七月的六个月中，就在铁道沿线搬掉了敌机投下的四千多枚定时炸弹。在七月十日这一天，他们就搬掉了七百多枚定时炸弹。
    中国人民志愿军铁道部队开展了广泛的合理化建议运动，发挥每一个人的智慧，对战胜敌机的轰炸、完成繁重的运输任务起了极其重要的作用。一九五二年初，敌机对我铁道运输的咽喉地带进行所谓“绞杀战”，曾在某些地段造成严重的破坏。但由于抢修部队创造了迅速填平弹坑的新办法，减少三分之二的施工时间，保证了及时通车。当炸弹炸弯了铁路上的钢轨时，抢修部队的战士们就想种种办法将钢轨弄直。某部二连曾创造一天中直轨二百十四根的纪录，但另一部队采用更科学的流水作业法，使八个人在八小时内就能直轨五十五根。
    志愿军铁道部队的发明创造是惊人的。某团在一年内就有一百多件合理化建议。其中有连长刘敏创造的“探险铲”，可在夜间探出钢轨上的裂纹；有十一连指战员创造的“复轨器”，可以把脱线的车皮拉到路线上来。据志愿军铁道部队某部统计，该部五百多名立功人员中，有三分之一是由于合理化建议和发明创造而立功的。
