    The Pastoral Area Work Medical Team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region, which had been working in the pastoral areas of 18 counties in the three special districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Dihua since May of last year, conducting health propaganda and medical work, has completed its mission and returned to Dihua.

    In the five and a half months in the pastoral areas, the medical team treated a total of more than 67,000 patients, with a cure rate of 59.7 percent. They also provided health education to 180,000 people in the pastoral areas, and conducted vaccinations and physical examinations for the vast number of herdsmen. To meet the needs of the various ethnic groups in the pastoral areas, they also trained 581 ethnic minority midwives and 795 health workers. More than 1,600 health groups were established in various townships.

    The medical team helped the people in the pastoral areas carry out mass patriotic health campaigns. For example, in the pastoral areas of Yili and Tacheng special districts, 2,140 new toilets, 44 bath ponds, and 291 wells have been built. Waste disposal, fly eradication, and lice eradication have also been universally carried out.

    新疆军区牧区工作医疗大队返迪化
    去年五月间深入伊犁、塔城、迪化三个专区的十八个县的牧区的中国人民解放军新疆军区牧区工作医疗大队，进行卫生宣传和医疗工作，已完成任务回到迪化。
    医疗大队在牧区五个半月中，共诊治病人六万七千多人，治愈率达百分之五十九点七；并使牧区十八万人民受到卫生教育，给广大牧民进行了预防接种和体格检查。他们适应牧区各族人民的要求，还训练出少数民族接生员五百八十一人、卫生员七百九十五人。在各乡共建立了一千六百多个卫生小组。
    医疗大队帮助牧区人民开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动。如在伊犁、塔城两专区的牧区内，已新建了厕所两千一百四十个，洗澡塘四十四个，挖井二百九十一个；并普遍进行了清除垃圾、灭蝇、灭虱等工作。
