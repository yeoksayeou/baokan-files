    North China Construction Engineering Bureau

    Establishes Design Company and Actively Carries Out Design Preparation Work

    The North China Administrative Committee's Construction Engineering Bureau is strengthening its design organization and carrying out various preparatory works to ensure the success of basic construction engineering design.

    Last year, the engineering design of the engineering company under the North China Construction Engineering Bureau was undertaken by the company's design department. Due to its weak strength and neglect of surveying work, many errors occurred. For example, when designing an office for a certain unit, no surveying or drilling was conducted. Only during construction was it discovered that the water level was very high, and the original site could not be used for the foundation. This forced a series of works, such as the plane design and material storage plan, to be redone, resulting in a great waste. Recently, when the engineering company built a new office building in front of its premises, because no surveying or drilling was carried out before the design, the line was drawn on the residents' buildings when the construction line was drawn. It was also discovered that the soil quality was poor, so work was stopped to change the design drawings and increase the foundation, resulting in waste.

    The Construction Engineering Bureau has learned from last year's experience and lessons. In order to do a good job in future basic construction engineering design, it has strengthened its forces on the basis of the design department of the engineering company and established a design company. One engineering geological drilling machine has been purchased, and two more have been ordered. Machines for testing tensile, compressive, and shear forces are being planned for purchase. In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical personnel, it is actively training drilling personnel and preparing to allocate and train a group of physical inspection and chemical analysis personnel. In terms of design work, in order to overcome the past phenomena of waiting for drawings to start work and changing drawings during construction, which delayed the construction period, it is now preparing a general design progress plan based on this year's design quantity, arranging the order according to priority. In addition to making full use of typical drawings, it is preparing to use model design (first making a wooden model of a certain proportion according to architectural requirements, and then making detailed construction drawings after research) to reduce the phenomenon of changing drawings due to inadequate design.

### 华北建筑工程局  成立设计公司积极进行设计准备工作

    华北建筑工程局
    成立设计公司积极进行设计准备工作
    华北行政委员会建筑工程局，为做好基本建设工程设计，正充实设计机构，进行各项准备工作。
    去年华北建筑工程局所属工程公司的工程设计，是由该公司设计部担任的，因为力量薄弱，忽视勘测工作，曾发生很多错误。如给某单位设计办公室，因没有勘测钻探，施工时才发现水位很高，原定地址不能做基础。这就使得平面设计、材料储存计划等一系列工作不得不重新进行，造成很大浪费。最近工程公司在门前新建办公楼一幢，因设计前没有进行测量钻探，到施工划线时把线划到居民的建筑物上，又发现土质不好，于是停工改变设计图，增大基础，造成浪费。
    建筑工程局接受去年的经验教训，为做好今后基本建设工程设计，已在工程公司设计部的基础上，充实力量，成立了设计公司。工程地质钻探机已购到了一部，并定制了两部。试验拉力、压力、剪力的机器等正在计划购置中。为解决技术人员不足的问题，正积极训练钻探人员，并准备调配和训练一批物理检验、化学分析的工作人员。在设计工作方面，为了克服已往停工待图及施工中改图，延误工期等现象，现正根据今年的设计数量，制作总的设计进度计划，按轻重缓急排列次序。除尽量利用典型图外，正准备采用模型设计（按建筑要求先制成一定比例的木模型，经过研究再制施工详图），减少因设计不周而改变图样的现象发生。（李荫蓬）
