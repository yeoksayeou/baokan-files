    Liao Zhongyi Writes to Express His Determination Not to Let Down the Party and the People's Government's Expectations of Him
    To the Editor: My name is Liao Zhongyi, and I work at the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company. Regarding the incident in which I was framed by corrupt elements for reporting the corrupt behavior of certain cadres, the People's Daily published two articles on July 8th of last year: "Liao Zhongyi Framed for Reporting Corruption; Shanxi Provincial People's Government Holds Cadre Meeting to Review Bureaucracy" and "How I Was Framed by Corrupt Elements." At the same time, it also published a brief political and legal commentary entitled "Adopt All Effective Measures to Thoroughly Eliminate Bureaucracy." Comrade Tao Lujia, Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also spoke on the radio about this incident. Finally, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government made a fair and serious decision on the matter at its 75th administrative meeting. During the process, Comrade Chen Keng of the Shanxi Daily conducted a precise investigation of the relevant materials; all comrades of Harbin Foreign Language School, Comrade Zhang Ligen of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, comrades at all levels of various departments in Shanxi Province, and all comrades of the Civil Affairs Section of the Jintang County People's Government in Sichuan Province, have expressed their condolences to me in newspapers or by sending letters directly. Because I was ill, I did not express my gratitude to them one by one.
    My illness was difficult to treat in Taiyuan. In early October last year, I was again fortunate to have Comrade Tao Lujia, Chairman Pei Lisheng of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and Vice Chairman Wang Shiying, apply to the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government to allow me to go to Beijing for treatment. Then, I was introduced to the Central People's Hospital for hospitalization. Now, according to the doctor, my illness is about to be cured. During my hospitalization, I was also fortunate to have Chairman Pei Lisheng, Vice Chairman Wang Shiying, and responsible comrades such as Zhou Huamin, Sun Zhe, and Liu Wenshan of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce, as well as the leading comrades and all comrades of my branch company, send representatives together with Section Chief Wang of the head office to visit me in the hospital; Comrade Tao Lujia also sent a special letter to encourage me; the Beijing Office of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government not only sent representatives to visit me in the hospital, but also conducted a detailed investigation of my condition for three or four hours, and gave me much enlightenment in my thinking. The Party and the People's Government care for me so much that I cannot sleep or eat in peace, and every time I think about it, I am so excited that tears stream down my face. I know that only today, only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, can I receive such warmth and glory. After I recover from my illness, I will never let down the Party and the People's Government's care and expectations for me. I will devote every ounce of strength I have to serve the people to the end. I hope that the Party and the People's Government will continue to educate me.

    廖中一来信表示决不辜负党和人民政府对他的期望
    编辑同志：我叫廖中一，在中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司工作。我因检举某些干部的贪污行为而被贪污分子陷害的事件，人民日报于去年七月八日发表“廖中一因检举贪污遭诬陷，山西省人民政府开干部会检查官僚主义”和“我是怎样被贪污分子陷害的”二文报道过，同时还发表了以“采取一切有效办法，彻底肃清官僚主义”为题的政法工作简评。中共山西省委员会副书记陶鲁笳同志在广播电台也针对这一事件讲过话。最后，经山西省人民政府在第七十五次行政会议上作了公正严肃的处理。在处理过程中，曾经山西日报陈铿同志对有关材料作过精确的调查；哈尔滨外国语学校全体同志、志愿军某部张利根同志、山西省各部门的各级同志以及四川金堂县人民政府民政科全体同志，曾经分别在报纸上或直接寄信来慰问我。我因为在病中，没有一一表示谢意。
    我的病在太原难于治疗。去年十月上旬，又蒙陶鲁笳同志和山西省人民政府裴丽生主席、王世英副主席，替我请准中央人民政府卫生部到北京治疗。继经介绍到中央人民医院住院治疗。现在，据医生谈，我的病即将痊愈。在住院当中，又蒙裴丽生主席、王世英副主席和山西省商业厅周化民、孙哲厅、刘文山等负责同志，及我分公司领导同志和全体同志派代表会同总公司王科长来医院慰问我；陶鲁笳同志也特别来信鼓励我；山西省人民政府驻京办事处除派代表到医院慰问我以外，还对我的病情作了三、四小时的详细调查，并且在思想上给了我许多启发。党和人民政府这样地爱护我，真使我寝食难安，每一想起，就会激动得热泪直流。我知道，只有在今天，只有在毛主席、共产党领导下的今天，我才会得到这样的温暖和光荣。待病痊愈后，我决不辜负党和人民政府对我的关怀和期望，我有一分力量，就要尽一分力量，为人民服务到底。希望党和人民政府继续不断地教育我。
