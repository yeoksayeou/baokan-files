Editor's Note: This article systematically summarizes the basic industrial construction work in Northeast China over the past three years and describes in detail the preparations made for basic construction in 1953. It is now published here for the study of various departments of financial and economic work and local leading organs as a reference for carrying out preparatory work for basic construction.

    How to Shift the Focus of Industrial Leadership to Basic Construction
    Northeast Industrial Department

    (I) A Change in Understanding

    After the complete liberation of Northeast China in the winter of 1948, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately transferred a large number of cadres from various provinces and cities to work in the industrial departments. At that time, the first problem we needed to solve in industry was how to restore industrial production in Northeast China on the basis of the destruction by the Kuomintang, how to enable our cadres to learn industrial production management as quickly as possible, how to raise the consciousness of workers to carry out democratic reforms in enterprises, and how to learn to transform the old, blind production into planned production. During the process of restoring production, although various enterprises and mines also carried out some construction (basic construction), until the first half of 1951, the basic construction of various enterprises and mines was mostly simple repairs or simple renovations. Therefore, during this period of about three years, the leading cadres of the enterprises and various institutions had to focus their main energy on industrial production, had to focus their leadership on practical production issues, and various institutions in the enterprises had to spend most of their time solving some pressing matters related to production. This was completely necessary and appropriate during the initial period of our takeover of the enterprises.

    However, since the second half of 1951, especially since 1952, the situation has changed significantly. This change is mainly reflected in the fact that Northeast China's industry has shifted from a relatively simple recovery stage to a stage of relatively large-scale basic construction. The scale of basic construction is no longer simple restoration or simple renovation. The basic construction project plan for 1952 already included many large-scale reconstruction projects (such as Anshan Iron and Steel's Project No. 0190 and 0230, hydroelectric and thermal power stations, etc.), many completely new enterprise construction projects, and many modern factories and mines designed by the Soviet Union, which required immediate and complex preparation. On the other hand, large-scale modern basic construction involves a wider range than current production problems, and it requires consideration of more complex principles and technical issues. Serious errors in basic construction often not only lead to economic waste, but also form historical errors in principle, or create irreparable long-term irrational phenomena. At the same time, our cadres and technicians have even less experience in the construction of modern enterprises. Under these circumstances, the following problem is prominently highlighted: the cadres, institutions, design forces, and construction forces leading our basic construction are far from commensurate with the tasks of basic construction. The subjective strength of basic construction cannot meet the requirements of the tasks of basic construction, which is obviously a major contradiction in Northeast China's industry. In view of this fundamental change in the situation in Northeast China's industry, starting from the second half of 1951, we focused on publicizing the position of basic construction in the overall work among all levels of cadres. Because not all cadres understood the decisive significance of basic construction for the entire industry in the future; strengthening the leadership of basic construction has become a top priority task, and not all cadres have accepted it: it is impossible to strengthen the basic construction force without solving this problem in the ideological understanding of cadres. To this end, under the direct leadership of the Northeast Bureau, we successively issued "Several Decisions on Design Work in Basic Construction", "Decision on Strengthening the Leadership of Basic Construction", as well as some specific decisions and instructions on design and construction in the second half of 1951, and constantly convened special meetings to discuss basic construction. All these decisions, instructions, and meetings were aimed at guiding cadres at all levels to change their ideological understanding, guiding cadres at all levels to understand the important principles and complex economic and technical issues in basic construction, and guiding cadres at all levels to place basic construction in an equally important or primary position with production.

    (II) Concrete Measures to Strengthen the Basic Construction Force

    Shifting the focus of leadership from production to basic construction is not an easy task. To truly change the ideological understanding of the majority of leading cadres, it is necessary to conduct continuous ideological struggle and constantly fight against all tendencies that neglect or relax basic construction. Because most cadres and technicians work in production departments, they only see some problems in current production, and they are only familiar with the problems in the production process. They cannot see the decisive role of basic construction for a while, and they are unwilling to work in the unfamiliar and difficult basic construction positions. Therefore, ideological fermentation among cadres and the leadership's close attention to ideological education on basic construction are necessary prerequisites for the transformation of work. After about half a year of ideological education, at the beginning of 1952, we more clearly proposed that all industrial departments (including heavy industry and light industry) should, without exception, place basic construction in the "primary position" of all work (the Northeast Bureau's instructions and Director Chen Yun's instructions to us in Northeast China gave the greatest help to this important transformation). In order to implement this policy, we adopted organizational measures. The principle of these measures is to transform the basic construction institutions into the strongest institutions in each enterprise management department. The specific methods implemented are as follows:

    A. Transfer most of the old cadres from the production departments to the basic construction departments. As a result of implementing this method, more than half of the old cadres working in the direct production departments were transferred to the basic construction departments. For example, after a mobilization meeting in Anshan, more than 20 old cadres were drawn from various factories and mines and transferred to the basic construction departments, leaving only a few old cadres in the direct production process. The reason why we adopted such a firm method is that, on the one hand, a preliminary management system has been established in production over the past few years, and the transfer will not affect the progress of production work too much; on the other hand, because these old cadres are relatively familiar with industry, if there are no old cadres who are relatively familiar with industry as the backbone in basic construction, and only rely on the newly transferred cadres, then the strength of basic construction cannot grow and expand quickly.

    B. Transfer the best technicians from the production departments to the design and construction departments of basic construction. The number of transfers is approximately equal to one-half of all the major technicians in the production departments. If the best technicians in production are not sent to the basic construction departments, then construction and design will not be able to proceed.

    C. Transfer a large number of skilled technical workers from production to the construction departments of basic construction.

    D. Newly graduated university and higher vocational students are, in principle, assigned to work in basic construction departments, or these graduates are sent to production departments, and technicians of the same number are replaced from factories and mines to the basic construction departments. As a result of the implementation of this method, it was ensured that the vast majority of students graduating in the summer of 1952 enriched the basic construction department institutions.

    E. Strengthen various organizational institutions in basic construction. From the Northeast Industrial Department to the various industrial bureaus, design offices (or companies), geological offices, testing and analysis institutions, and various professional construction organizations (most of them established civil engineering companies; important units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company established professional engineering companies for civil engineering, metal structure, mechanical installation, electrical installation, and furnace construction) were established according to their own needs. These organizations are necessary institutions for carrying out large-scale construction from the beginning. In particular, civil engineering companies and electromechanical installation companies need to be strengthened and improved first before facing large-scale construction. In the past two years, in order to cultivate the most basic force of basic construction, many cadres (engineering companies directly under the Northeast Industrial Department and engineering companies under the jurisdiction of various bureaus) have been successively dispatched, independent financial institutions, material supply institutions, transportation institutions, etc. have been established (in the past, they were completely managed by the production departments on their behalf); and a considerable amount of funds have been allocated in the investment to equip them with the necessary fixed assets and working capital (houses, transportation, automobiles, cement mixers, electric welding machines, mobile cranes, cement vibrators, lathes... and necessary ancillary processing plants, etc.). In this way, many small and scattered construction forces in the past have gradually formed large-scale state-owned construction companies, the construction engineering companies have become an independent force, and construction has gradually increased the degree of mechanization.

    F. Establish schools to train reserve forces. In addition to the schools led by the national education departments, we have started to establish secondary technical schools for geology, drilling schools, secondary technical schools for civil engineering and construction, surveying and mapping schools, and Russian training classes based on existing experience. Because strengthening the basic construction force not only needs to take care of today's practical needs, but also needs to take care of the trend that more and more technicians will be needed year by year in the next few years. In addition, in order to train technical workers, technical schools have also been established in major factories and mines. It is estimated that the number of students in Northeast China's technical schools will be about 30,000 by the end of 1952.

    G. In order to implement the transformation to basic construction, we have also stipulated organizational systems to ensure that the energy and time of administrative leading cadres in various industrial departments are mostly used for basic construction work. For example, it is stipulated that all bureau directors, company managers, and material supply departments and transportation departments should list the solution of basic construction needs as the first priority task; it is stipulated that of the eight managers and deputy managers of Anshan Iron and Steel, one is solely responsible for production, while the others are solely responsible for or concurrently in charge of basic construction.

    After ideological education and the adoption of the above-mentioned organizational measures, independent, relatively powerful, and independently working basic construction institutions were truly established in the various industrial bureaus (companies) and factories and mines with major basic construction. Although there were still many shortcomings, errors, and even many serious shortcomings and errors in the relatively large-scale basic construction in Northeast China in 1952, from the perspective of strengthening the basic construction force, there was indeed an important transformation in 1952. The administrative leading organs have placed basic construction in the "primary position" of all work.

    The administrative leading organs of the entire Northeast China industry shifted the focus of work from production to basic construction, and transferred a large number of cadres, technicians, and technical workers from production. Facts have proved that this did not cause a decline, backwardness, or regression in the production of various factories and mines. After the old cadres, technicians, and technical workers in the production factories and mines were transferred, on the one hand, they helped to establish and strengthen the work of the basic construction departments, and on the other hand, they also created a group of excellent and capable new cadres in the production factories and mines.

    However, it is not easy to take the above-mentioned measures organizationally. Whether it is transferring personnel, assigning cadres, or guiding cadres at all levels to turn their attention to basic construction, they all suffer countless obstacles. This requires the leadership's determination and support.

    (III) Preparatory Work for Basic Construction

    In view of the fact that the scale of industrial construction in Northeast China in 1953 is even larger than in 1952, if sufficient preparatory work is not done early, it will be impossible to complete the basic construction construction in 1953 according to the plan. Therefore, we believe that each bureau must carry out the following preparatory work:

    1. Design Preparation:

    A. In addition to the existing design institutions needing to continuously supplement technical personnel, in the second half of 1952, the design offices (or companies) of several major industrial bureaus must also establish testing and analysis institutions, establish surveying and mapping teams, and establish engineering geology teams. Because testing and analysis, complex surveying and mapping, and engineering geology are all necessary for the design of all major projects. Without testing and analysis (such as soil, steel, cement, etc.), errors in surveying and mapping (even small errors), and unclear engineering geological conditions, not only will huge engineering errors occur, but construction will be impossible at all.

    B. Make a design progress plan so that you can know the specific design capabilities, and then you can consider the basic construction plan for 1953 based on this, and specifically arrange the progress plan for each project in 1953.

    C. Make technical standards for design (technical quotas). In the past few years, the same factory building, dormitory, or the same equipment installation has various different standards, different utilization coefficients, different consumption quotas, and different costs in different design institutions. Some have adopted advanced standards technically, and some have adopted backward standards. In order to overcome backward technical standards and to improve the technology of design work, we should summarize the experience of the past few years, find similar designs, make comparisons, and then stipulate technical and economic quotas for design (of course, we can only make a part of technical and economic quotas at present, and we should gradually formulate complete standards in the future). Because without technical standards, we cannot guide the design work, and we cannot correctly review a certain design.

    D. Start the design review work. Past experience shows that if we do not carefully review the design, we will allow many backward, unreasonable, and erroneous designs to play a guiding role in basic construction. In order to reduce errors in design, industrial leading organs need to correct and review the designs that have been made at any time. This work requires a considerable amount of time and a certain number and quality of cadres and technical personnel. However, this difficult work must be completed before the construction in 1953. This is an important preparatory work.

    2. Preparation of Construction Forces:

    A. Enrich various professional construction companies. First, civil engineering companies need to be strengthened. According to the experience of the past few years, a major project requires the cooperation of various types of work, but in order to concentrate and unify the construction, the civil engineering company should become the main contractor of a project. Therefore, each system must have a strong civil engineering company. Secondly, according to the needs, organize professional engineering institutions such as machine installation companies, electrical installation companies, metal structure engineering companies, drilling teams, and furnace construction teams. Failure to actively organize and enrich these companies, attempting to outsource, or attempting to organize a comprehensive engineering company that can solve the problem regardless of the huge complexity of the project will result in failure in the construction in 1953.

    B. Construction deployment. In the fourth quarter of 1952, we should start considering the basic outline of the construction projects in 1953, and calculate the strength of each engineering company based on this. According to the amount of work, priority, and secondary, allocate construction forces, and clearly designate the tasks and construction areas of each engineering company, engineering office, and engineering team so that each engineering company can make all preparations in the area where it will carry out construction in 1953 as early as possible.

    C. Appropriately increase the number of permanent workers. At the end of the construction, various engineering companies should fix experienced workers as long-term employees in order to considerably reduce the proportion of temporary workers and migrant workers in basic construction. In terms of civil engineering and construction, the planned number of permanent workers should reach at least 30% (the proportion of permanent workers for installation workers should be even greater). The purpose of increasing the number of permanent workers is to cultivate the backbone of basic construction construction; to increase the organization of construction and installation workers; and to improve the technical level of basic construction workers.

    D. Establish ancillary factories for basic construction. In order to improve the quality and speed of basic construction, and to reduce project costs, all factories and mines or areas with huge projects should immediately start planning to establish ancillary factories to serve the construction, such as cement prefabricated products factories (cement, floors, stairs, etc.), cement mixing plants, wood product factories (prefabricated doors and windows, etc.), box board factories (specializing in manufacturing box boards for pouring cement), metal processing factories, drilling machine parts factories, etc. These ancillary factories can be established on one construction site according to the size of the project, or they can be jointly established and used by several construction sites.

    E. Material preparation. Areas with major projects need to use the winter to transport sand, gravel, cement, wood, bricks, etc. to the construction site as much as possible to avoid work stoppages due to waiting for materials during construction and to avoid transportation congestion.

    F. Winter training. In order to improve the construction efficiency in 1953, each engineering company needs to use the winter to conduct winter training for technicians and staff workers. The Northeast Industrial Department approved the winter training plan for the directly affiliated civil engineering company as follows: all permanent workers, 1,500 construction workers, 1,000 material workers, 300 statisticians, 300 accountants, 180 salary workers, 100 technical security workers, 300 trainee technicians and trainees, and 300 construction site directors. Training content: general permanent workers are for small group organization system (responsibility system), practice of advanced operation methods (requiring second-class workers to become first-class workers after practice) and political education; construction workers are for technical management (especially focusing on the management of segmented assembly line operations), responsibility system (especially focusing on the responsibility system for ensuring quality), learning to read drawings and political education; construction site directors are for project management, economic accounting, construction site organization and responsibility system, political education, etc.

    3. Preparation of "Construction Organization Design":

    In the past, we did not know the importance of construction organization design, so we generally started construction without preparing for construction design, which invariably caused confusion on the construction site, seriously affected the construction progress, and caused a lot of waste (for example, materials were piled on the foundation, transportation roads were opened on pipelines, temporary buildings occupied transportation roads, etc.).

    Now we should pay great attention to the design of construction organization according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and we must first do the design of construction organization before starting construction. Under the guidance of the advanced experience of Soviet experts, the design of construction organization should include the following: construction procedure; annual workload schedule; general construction plan; calculation of building materials that can be supplied locally; design of temporary buildings; how to supply temporary roads, water, and electricity; the required number of construction machinery and tools; the design of temporary construction workshops; the required number of employees and the proportion of types of work, etc. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the many erroneous lessons we have learned over the past few years have proved that only after the design of the construction organization is done can smooth construction be guaranteed. Therefore, we should emphasize the significance of this work again and again, and we must equip the construction organization design with a certain number of technical personnel, and make the construction organization design an important work that is indispensable before technical design and the start of construction.

    4. Preparation for Foreign Design:

    In addition to the projects we design ourselves, the design of many important factory and mine projects is entrusted to Soviet experts. In the past two years, we have deeply realized that entrusting the design of a major project to Soviet experts does not mean that we can sit and wait for the design to arrive. In order to ensure that Soviet experts can carry out the design smoothly, we must carry out the following preparatory work:

    A. The design institution must prepare a set of technical personnel. The tasks of these technical personnel are: First, to collect the necessary information for the design; second, to work with the Soviet design team and learn from them. If the Soviet experts are designing a certain factory or mine in China, these technical personnel will delay the construction of major factories and mines if they do not prepare early.

    B. Preparation of design data: including the preparation of geological resources (this requires geological personnel and drilling personnel), the preparation of engineering geological data (including the collection and analysis of groundwater hydrology, soil, climate conditions, and other data related to earthquakes in major projects), and the measurement of engineering areas (requiring many surveyors and surveying instruments); if it is the renovation design of an existing mine, complex surveying and mapping work is also required (requiring many surveying and mapping technicians and testing and analysis).

    C. Preparation for translation: The lack of the necessary number of translators often delays important design work. In the past, we underestimated this, which greatly affected the work, so it needs to be widely noted and cultivated in time. For example, a certain factory has only a preliminary design, which has 2 million words (requiring 40 to 50 translators to concentrate on translating for half a month). The information collected for a mine design has 120,000 words that need to be translated into Russian.

    (IV) Economic Accounting in Basic Construction

    In the past few years, when talking about economic accounting in basic construction, our enterprise leading cadres often only paid attention to investment management and financial supervision, which is of course an important economic accounting measure; however, according to our understanding of the basic construction situation, we believe that there should be three important aspects of economic accounting in the current basic construction:

    First, financial supervision and investment management. Through the review of investment, control the use of investment, stipulate the indicators for reducing construction and installation costs in basic construction, and ensure the correct use of investment through financial management and supervision... This work should be strengthened, and appropriate systems should continue to be revised. And it is necessary to continuously carry out resolute struggles against all views that violate financial systems and despise financial supervision.

    Second, repeated review of the design to achieve the maximum economic accounting in basic construction. At present, the biggest economic accounting problem in basic construction is first of all how the quality of each engineering design is. If a design is unreasonable, or this design does not adopt the advanced technical achievements that can be achieved, then even if there is the most stringent financial supervision in construction, it still cannot change the waste of national investment. The experience of the past few years has proved countless times that a factory that produces the same quantity and quality of products may differ in investment by more than double simply because of the different technical standards adopted by the design; experience has also proved that these errors, problems, and shortcomings in the design not only cause the greatest waste of basic construction investment, but also cause long-term production irrationality (low output, poor quality, and high cost) of a factory and mine. Therefore, the review of the design of a factory, mine, or project (the conditions for address selection, the conditions for using raw materials, the determination of production scale, the technical conditions adopted, etc.) contains the meaning of the greatest economic accounting, and if this work is ignored, it is equivalent to abandoning the most serious economic accounting work in basic construction.

    Third, discover and promote advanced experience in the design and construction of basic construction. As long as we pay attention to improving the political awareness of technicians and employees, constantly discover advanced working methods in design and construction, and can create conditions for its promotion organizationally, we can increase the speed of construction and greatly reduce construction costs. For example, the emergence of "segmented assembly line operations" in housing construction in 1952 doubled the speed of housing construction and enabled the construction of tens of thousands of square meters of buildings in a month and a half. This is a huge economic calculation in basic construction.

    We believe that the second and third types of economic accounting are of the most significant significance for the current basic construction. Therefore, in addition to continuing to strengthen the first type of economic accounting measures, we should pay more attention to these two tasks.

### 如何把工业领导重心转到基本建设方面
东北工业部

第2版()
专栏：

    编者按：这一篇文章系统地总结了东北三年多以来的工业基本建设工作，并详细叙述了为一九五三年基本建设所作的准备工作。现在把它发表在这里，供财政经济工作的各部门及各地领导机关研究，作为进行基本建设准备工作的参考。
    如何把工业领导重心转到基本建设方面
    东北工业部
    （一）认识上的转变
    一九四八年冬东北全部解放后，中共中央东北局即刻从各省市抽调了大批干部分配到工业部门工作。当时我们在工业中首先需要解决的问题，是如何在国民党破坏了的基础上把东北工业的生产恢复起来，如何使我们的干部以最快的速度学会工业中的生产管理，如何提高职工的觉悟进行企业的民主改革，如何学习把旧的盲目的生产转为计划生产。在恢复生产的过程中，各个企业厂矿虽然也有些修建（基本建设），但是直到一九五一年上半年，各企业厂矿的基本建设还大多是属于比较简单的修复或比较简单的改造。因此，在这约三年的时间中，企业的领导干部以及企业中的各种机构，不能不把主要的精力放在工业的生产方面，不能不把领导的重点放在现实的生产问题上，企业中的各种机构不能不把大部分时间放在解决生产问题的一些迫切事务上。这在我们接管企业开始的一个时期是完全必要与适当的。
    但是从一九五一年下半年，特别是一九五二年开始，情况已起了显著的变化，这种变化主要表现在东北工业已由比较简单的恢复阶段走向规模相当大的基本建设阶段。基本建设的规模已经不是比较简单的恢复或比较简单的改造了。一九五二年的基本建设工程计划已经包括了许多规模宏大的改建工程（如鞍钢的○一九○号、○二三○号工程，水力、火力电站等），许多完全新的企业建设工程，还有许多个请苏联设计的现代化的工厂矿山，需要立即进行复杂的准备工作。另一方面，大规模的现代化的基本建设所涉及的范围比目前生产问题更加广阔，它需要考虑解决的原则问题与技术问题，更加错综复杂。基本建设中如发生严重错误，常常不只是经济上的浪费，并将形成历史性的原则错误，或者造成无法挽救的长期不合理的现象。同时我们的干部以及技术人员对于现代化企业的建设更加没有经验。在这种情况之下，就突出地显示出了这样一个问题：我们领导基本建设的干部、机构以及基本建设的设计力量和施工力量，远远与基本建设的任务不相称。基本建设的主观力量不能适应基本建设任务的要求，显然就成为东北工业中的一个主要矛盾。鉴于东北工业中的这种基本情况的变化，我们从一九五一年下半年开始，就在所有各级干部中着重宣传基本建设在整个工作中的地位。因为基本建设工作对今后整个工业决定性的意义，并不是所有干部都已了解了；加强对基本建设的领导已成为头等重要的任务，也并非所有干部都已接受了：不在干部的思想认识上解决这一问题，加强基本建设力量是不可能的。为此，在东北局直接领导下，我们于一九五一年下半年连续发出了“关于基本建设中设计工作的几项决定”、“关于加强基本建设领导的决定”以及关于设计与施工的一些具体决定与指示，并且不断地召集了讨论基本建设的专门会议。所有这些决定、指示和会议，目的都是为了引导各级企业干部转变思想认识，引导各级干部认识基本建设中重要的原则问题与复杂的经济技术问题，引导各级干部把基本建设放在与生产同等重要地位或首要地位。
    （二）采取加强基本建设力量的具体措施
    把领导重点从生产转到基本建设这件事并不是容易的，使大多数领导干部在思想认识上真正转变过来，必须进行不断的思想斗争，必须不断地向一切忽视或放松基本建设的倾向进行斗争。因为大部分干部与技术人员都在生产部门工作，他们所看到的只是目前生产中的一些问题，他们所熟悉的也只是生产过程中的问题，他们一时看不清基本建设的决定作用，他们也不愿到生疏的、困难重重的基本建设岗位上工作。因此，干部中的思想酝酿及领导上抓紧进行关于基本建设的思想教育，是使工作转变所必需的先决条件。经过了大约半年的思想教育后，一九五二年初，我们更明确地提出所有工业部门（包括重工业与轻工业）都应无例外地把基本建设放在所有工作的“首要地位”（东北局的指示与陈云主任到东北对我们的指示，对这一重要的转变给了最大的帮助）。为了贯彻这一方针，我们采取了组织上的措施，这种措施的原则是把基本建设的机构变为在各个企业管理部门中最强的机构。实行的具体办法如下：
    甲、将生产部门中的老干部，大部抽调到基本建设部门。实行这一办法的结果，在直接生产部门工作的老干部约有二分之一以上转到了基本建设部门工作。例如鞍山在一次动员会后，即从各厂矿抽出了二十多个老干部转到了基本建设部门，直接生产过程中只剩下了少数几个老干部。我们之所以采取这样坚决的办法，一方面是由于几年来生产中已建立了初步的管理制度，抽调之后不致太影响生产工作的进行；另一方面，是因为这些老干部，对于工业已比较熟悉，基本建设中如果没有比较熟悉工业的老干部做为骨干，而只依靠刚抽调来的干部，则基本建设的力量不可能很快增长壮大起来。
    乙、将生产部门中最好的技术人员抽调到基本建设的设计与施工部门，抽调的数目大约亦等于生产部门所有主要的技术人员的二分之一。不把生产中最好的技术人员派到基本建设部门，则施工与设计均将无法进行。
    丙、从生产中抽调大批熟练的技术工人到基本建设的施工部门。
    丁、新毕业的大学生与高职学生，原则上都分配到基本建设部门工作，或者把这些毕业生派到生产部门，而从厂矿中替换出同等数量的技术人员到基本建设部门。这一办法实行的结果，保证了一九五二年暑期毕业学生的绝大部分充实了基本建设部门机构。
    戊、壮大基本建设中各种组织机构。从东北工业部到各个工业管理局，都根据其本身的需要，分别成立了设计处（或公司）、地质处、化验分析机构及各种专业的施工组织（多数建立了土木建筑公司，鞍山钢铁公司等重要单位则建立了土木建筑、金属结构、机械安装、电气安装、筑炉等专业工程公司），这些组织是进行大规模建设一开始所必需的机构。特别是土木建筑公司与机电安装公司是面临大规模建设之前，首先需要壮大健全的。两年来为了培养这种基本建设最基本的力量，曾经陆续派遣了许多干部（东北工业部直属的工程公司与隶属各管理局的工程公司），建立了独立的财务机构、材料供应机构、运输机构等等（过去是完全依靠生产部门代为管理的）；并在投资中拨付了相当大的资金，使其具备必要的固定资金与流动资金（房屋、运输、汽车、洋灰搅拌机、电焊机、移动吊车、水泥震荡器、车床………以及必要的附属加工厂等等）。这样，才使过去许多小的零乱的建筑力量，逐渐形成了规模较大的国营建筑公司，才使建筑工程公司成为一个独立的力量，才使建筑逐渐增加了机械化的程度。
    己、建立培养后备力量的学校。除了由国家教育部门领导的学校外，我们根据现有经验又开始建立了地质中等技术学校、钻探学校、土木建筑中等技术学校、测绘学校及俄文训练班。因为壮大基本建设的力量不仅要照顾到今天的现实需要，同时必需照顾到今后数年一年比一年需要更多技术人员的趋势。此外，为培养技术工人，在各主要厂矿中，又办了技工学校。预计一九五二年年底东北技工学校学生约为三万人。
    庚、为了贯彻向基本建设的转变，我们又在组织制度上规定了保证各工业部门中行政领导干部的精力与时间大部使用到基本建设工作上的办法，例如规定所有管理局局长、公司经理及材料供应部门运输部门等，把解决基本建设的需要列为第一位的任务；规定鞍钢八位经理、副经理中除一位专管生产外，其他均专责或兼管基本建设。
    经过从思想认识上教育及采取了以上一些组织措施之后，才真正在各工业管理局（公司）及有重大基本建设的厂矿，建立了独立的、比较有力的、能够独立工作的基本建设机构。虽然一九五二年东北规模比较大的基本建设中还存在着许多缺点、错误，甚至是许多严重的缺点、错误，但是从壮大基本建设力量说，一九五二年确是有了一个重要的转变，行政领导机关已经把基本建设放到了一切工作的“首要地位”。
    整个东北工业的行政领导机关把工作重点从生产转向了基本建设，并从生产中抽调了大批干部、技术人员与技术工人，事实证明并没有引起各个工厂矿山生产的下降、落后或退步。生产厂矿中的老干部、技术人员与技术工人被抽调之后，一方面帮助建立和壮大了基本建设部门的工作，另一方面也使生产厂矿中产生了一批优秀的有能力的新干部。
    但是在组织上采取以上措施并不是容易的，不管是抽调人员、分配干部或引导各级干部把注意力转向基本建设，都遭受着无数的阻碍。这就需要领导上的决心与支持。
    （三）基本建设的准备工作
    鉴于一九五三年东北工业建设规模更大于一九五二年，如不早做充分的准备工作，一九五三年的基本建设施工是不可能完成计划的。因此，我们认为各管理局必须进行下列的准备工作：
    一、设计的准备：
    甲、除已有的设计机构需要不断地补充技术人员外，一九五二年下半年几个主要工业管理局的设计处（或公司），还必须建立化验分析机构，建立测绘队，建立工程地质队。因为化验分析、复杂的测绘以及工程地质，均为一切重大工程设计所必需。如果没有化验分析（例如土壤、钢材、水泥等），测绘发生错误（甚至是细小的差错），不明工程地质情况，不仅会发生巨大工程的错误，而且根本不可能进行施工。
    乙、做出设计进度计划，这样才能知道设计的具体能力，而且才能据此考虑一九五三年的基本建设计划，才能具体排列一九五三年的各项工程进度计划。
    丙、做出设计的技术标准（技术定额）。几年来同样的一个厂房、宿舍或同样的设备安装，在不同的设计机构就有各种不同的标准、不同的利用系数、不同的消耗定额、不同的成本，有的技术上采取了先进的标准，有的采取了落后的标准。为了克服落后的技术标准，为了设计工作技术的提高，应该总结几年来的经验，找出同类设计，做出比较，从而规定设计上的技术经济定额（当然目前我们还只能做出一部分技术经济定额，今后应逐渐制定出完整的标准）。因为没有技术上的标准，我们即不可能对设计工作加以指导，同时也不可能正确地进行对某一设计的审查。
    丁、开始设计的审查工作。过去的经验说明，如果我们对设计不进行慎审地审查，就会使许多落后的、不合理的设计以及错误的设计在基本建设中起指导作用。为了减少设计上的错误，各工业领导机关需要对于已做出的设计随时进行校正审查，这一工作需相当多的时间与一定数量、质量的干部与技术人员。但一九五三年施工之前，必须完成这一困难工作，这是一项重要的准备工作。
    二、施工力量的准备：
    甲、充实各种专业的建筑公司。首先是土木建筑公司需要加强。根据几年来的经验，一项重大的工程需要各种不同工种的配合，但为了施工的集中统一，土木建筑公司应成为一个工程的主包人，因此各个系统必需有一强有力的土木建筑公司。其次，再根据需要，组织机器安装公司、电气安装公司、金属结构工程公司、钻探队、筑炉队等专业的工程机构。不积极地组织与充实这些公司，企图外包，或不管工程的巨大复杂而企图组织一个一揽子的工程公司就可解决问题的，都会在一九五三年施工中遭受到失败。
    乙、施工部署。一九五二年第四季度即应开始考虑一九五三年施工工程的基本轮廓，并据此计算各个工程公司的力量，根据工程量的多少、主次，分配施工力量，明确地指定每个工程公司、工程处、工程队的任务及其施工地区，以使各个工程公司有可能及早在它一九五三年要进行施工的地区进行一切准备工作。
    丙、适当地增加固定工人。施工结束时，各种工程公司均应把有经验的工人固定为长年职工，以便相当地减少基本建设中临时工流动工的比例。就土木建筑工程说，拟固定的工人至少应达到百分之三十（安装工人的固定工人比例应更大些）。增加固定工人的目的是：培养基本建设施工的骨干；增加建筑安装工人的组织性；提高基本建设工人的技术水平。
    丁、建立基本建设的附属工厂。为了提高基本建设的质量与速度，为了降低工程成本，一切有巨大工程的厂矿或地区，应即开始筹划建立为施工服务的附属工厂，如洋灰预制成品厂（洋灰、地板、楼梯等）、洋灰搅拌厂、木材制品厂（预制门窗等）、盒子板厂（专门制造灌浇洋灰的盒子板）、金属加工厂、钻机零件厂等等。这些附属工厂根据工程的大小，可于一个工地建立，亦可由几个工地联合建立共同使用。
    戊、材料准备。有重大工程的地区，需要利用冬季将砂石、洋灰、木材、砖石等等尽可能运至施工现场，以免施工期间的停工待料及避免运输的拥挤。
    己、冬季整训。为了提高一九五三年施工效率，每个工程公司需利用冬季对技术人员及职员工人进行冬季训练。东北工业部批准直属土木建筑公司冬季的训练计划为：全体固定工人，施工员一千五百人，材料员一千人，统计员三百人，会计三百人，工薪员一百八十人，技术保安员一百人，见习技术员及练习生三百人，工地主任三百人。训练内容：一般固定工人为小组组织制度（责任制）、先进操作方法的实习（要求二等工经过实习变为一等工）及政治教育；施工员为技术管理（特别着重于分段流水作业的管理）、责任制（特别着重于保证质量的责任制度）、学习看图纸及政治教育；工地主任为计划管理、经济核算、工地组织与责任制、政治教育等。
    三、“施工组织设计”的准备：
    过去我们不知道施工组织设计的重要，因而一般地不做施工设计的准备即行开工，结果无例外地造成施工现场的混乱，严重影响施工进度并造成不少浪费（例如材料堆集到地基之上，运输道开在管道之上，临时建筑物占了运输道路等等）。
    现在我们应根据苏联的先进经验，十分重视施工组织的设计，而且必须在开工之前，首先将施工组织设计做好。根据苏联专家先进经验的指导，施工组织设计应包括下列各项：建筑程序；年工作量进度表；施工总平面图；当地可供应的建筑材料的计算；临时建筑物的设计；临时道路水电如何供应；施工机械及工具需要的数量；临时施工车间的设计；所需职工的数量及工种的比例等。苏联的先进经验及我们几年来许多错误的教训都证明，只有做好了施工组织设计之后，才能保证顺利的施工。因此，我们应该再三地强调这一工作的意义，必须为施工组织设计配备一定数量的技术人员，把施工组织设计做为技术设计与开始施工之前必不可少的一项重要工作。
    四、国外设计的准备：
    除我们自己设计的工程外，许多重要厂矿工程的设计是委托苏联专家进行的。最近两年来使我们深刻地认识到：一项重大工程委托苏联专家设计，不等于我们可以坐等设计的到来，为了保证苏联专家能顺利进行设计，我们必须进行以下的准备工作：
    甲、设计机构中必须准备一套技术人员，这些技术人员的任务：一是收集设计所必需的资料，二是和苏联设计组一道工作，向其学习。假如苏联专家对某一厂矿的设计是在中国进行，这些技术人员，如不早做准备，重大的厂矿建设将会推迟。
    乙、设计资料的准备：包括地质资源的准备（这就需要地质人员及钻探人员），工程地质资料的准备
    （包括重大工程的地下水文、土壤、气候条件以及有关地震等资料的收集分析），工程地区的测量（需要许多测量人员及测量仪器）；如果是原有矿山的改造设计，则还需要复杂的测绘工作（需要许多测绘技术人员以及化验分析）。
    丙、翻译的准备：缺少必要数量的翻译常常使重要的设计工作拖迟。过去我们对此估计不足，影响工作甚大，故需引起普遍的注意，及时培养。例如某厂仅只一个初步设计，即有二百万字（需要四五十名翻译集中力量翻译半个月）。为一个矿山设计所收集的资料，即有十二万字需译成俄文。
    （四）基本建设中的经济核算
    几年来在谈到基本建设的经济核算时，我们企业的领导干部，往往只注意到投资的管理及财政监督，这当然是一项重要的经济核算的措施；但是根据我们所了解的基本建设情况，认为目前基本建设中的经济核算应该有三个重要方面：
    一是财政监督，投资管理。经过对于投资的审核，控制投资的使用，规定基本建设中降低建筑安装成本的指标，经过财务管理与监督以保证投资的正确运用……这一工作应该加强，应该继续增订适当的制度。并且需要不断地向一切违反财务制度、轻视财政监督的观点进行坚决的斗争。
    二是对设计加以反复的审核，来达到基本建设中最大的经济核算。目前基本建设中最大的经济核算问题，首先在于每一工程设计的质量如何，假如一个设计不合理，或者这一设计没有采取可能达到的先进技术成就，那么在施工中即使有最严格的财务监督，同样不能改变国家投资的浪费。几年来的经验无数次地证明：生产同等数量同等质量产品的一个工厂，仅仅由于设计所采取的技术标准不同，而投资可能相差一倍以上；经验又证明：这种设计上的错误、毛病、缺点不仅造成基本建设投资的最大浪费，而且会造成一个工厂矿山长期生产上的不合理（产量低、质量坏、成本高）。因此，对于一个工厂矿山或一个工程设计的审查（地址选择的条件、使用原材料的条件、生产规模的确定、采用的技术条件等等），包含了最大的经济核算的意义，而且如果忽视了这一工作，就等于放弃了基本建设中最严重的一项经济核算工作。
    三是在基本建设的设计与施工中，发现及推广先进经验。只要我们注意提高技术人员与职工的政治觉悟，在设计与施工中经常不断地发现先进工作方法，并能在组织上给它创造推广的条件，则可以增加建设的速度，大大降低建筑成本。例如一九五二年房屋建设中的“分段流水作业”的出现，就使房屋建筑的速度提高一倍，就使数万平方公尺的楼房于一个半月的时间建筑完成。这是基本建设中一种巨大的经济核算。
    我们认为第二与第三种的经济核算对于目前的基本建设最具有重大的意义。因此，除继续加强第一种经济核算的措施外，应该更加抓紧这两项工作。
