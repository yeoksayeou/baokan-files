Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 24th: In order to further develop cultural and health undertakings, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province will undertake basic construction with a total building area of over 60,000 square meters this year. This includes the Yanbian Hospital, Tuberculosis Hospital, the Medical Department of Yanbian University, Yanbian Senior High School, and the Yanbian People's Broadcasting Station, as well as expansions of some factories and mines. To successfully complete this task, the Autonomous Region People's Government established a construction engineering company in November of last year and built dormitories sufficient for more than 400 construction workers. The more than 500 fixed construction workers are being trained in batches with political and technical studies and on-site preparation. The construction engineering company is currently organizing more than 100 workers to start quarrying, and has formed a geological survey team and a surveying team to conduct geological surveys and surveying work. At the same time, design work is being stepped up to ensure that construction starts ahead of schedule in mid-April. Many veteran technicians have formed an advanced experience research committee, preparing to effectively promote various advanced experiences such as Su Changyou's bricklaying method during construction.

    延边朝鲜民族自治区将进一步发展文化卫生事业
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】吉林省延边朝鲜民族自治区为进一步发展文化、卫生事业，今年将进行六万余平方公尺建筑面积的基本建设，其中包括延边医院、结核病院、延边大学医学部、延边高级中学和延边人民广播电台以及部分工厂矿山的扩充等。为胜利完成这一任务，自治区人民政府在去年十一月成立了建筑工程公司，建筑了足够四百多名建筑工人用的宿舍。对固定下来的五百多名建筑工人，正分批进行政治技术学习和现场准备等训练。建筑工程公司，现组织一百多名工人着手采石，并组成地质勘察组和测量组进行地质勘察和测量工作；同时加紧进行设计工作，以保证在四月中旬提前开工。许多老技工组成了先进经验研究委员会，准备在施工中很好地推广苏长有砌砖法等各种先进经验。
