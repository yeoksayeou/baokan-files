Beijing universities and vocational schools are gradually strengthening physical education. Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Renmin University of China and other schools have established "Extracurricular Sports Committees" to specifically lead sports activities throughout the school. The committees are generally chaired by the Director of Studies and include cadres from the school's administrative sports department or sports section, health clinic, Communist Youth League branch and student union. As a result of the administration's emphasis and promotion, sports activities in many schools have made considerable progress. Peking University Medical College, which used to neglect sports work, now sees sports as an indispensable part of students' spare time activities. Morning exercises have become one of the best forms of mass physical exercise at China's Peking Union Medical College, with more than 95% of the total number of students participating in morning exercises every day. Many sports associations and exercise groups have emerged in various schools, and they frequently carry out sports competitions and sports performances.

In order to make sports develop better, the sports teachers in many schools pay great attention to technical guidance. In addition to explaining the exercise methods of various sports in class, they also go to the sports field during extracurricular activities to check everyone's exercise and provide individual guidance. All schools have also generally carried out physical examinations and provided students with sports hygiene education, grouping them according to their physical strength; Peking University Medical College has set up a medical sports group to take care of students with weak bodies, carrying out different sports exercises, with good results.

    北京各大学和专科学校正逐渐加强体育工作
    北京市各大学和专科学校正逐渐加强体育工作。北京大学、北京师范大学和中国人民大学等校都成立了“课外运动委员会”，具体领导全校的体育活动。委员会一般都由教务长任主任委员，吸收学校行政方面的体育部或体育科、卫生室及中国新民主主义青年团支部和学生会的干部参加。由于行政方面的重视和提倡的结果，许多学校的体育活动都有了长足的进步。一向忽视体育工作的北京大学医学院，现在体育已经变成学生课余活动中不可少的内容。早操已成为中国协和医学院群众性体育锻炼最好的形式之一，每天参加早操的都在总人数百分之九十五以上。各个学校都出现了许多运动社团和锻炼小组，并经常进行体育竞赛和体育表演等活动。
    为了使得体育运动更好地向前发展，许多学校的体育教员在技术指导上都很注意，他们除在课内讲解各项运动的锻炼方法外，每天还在课外活动时间到运动场上去检查大家的锻炼情况，进行个别指导。各校还普遍进行了体格检查，并向学生进行运动卫生教育，按照各人体质的强弱分别编组；北京大学医学院为照顾体弱的学生，特别成立了一个医疗体育组，进行不同的体育锻炼，效果良好。（新华社）
