    Introducing "A Technical School Principal's Handbook"
    Huang Dasan
    Written by Soviet author Rakino, translated by Wu Feng, published by Northeast Education Publishing House.

    "A Technical School Principal's Handbook" is a book of great reference value for technical education workers at all levels in our country.

    The author, Rakino, has over twenty years of experience in training industrial cadres. He has served as the director of the education research office of an electrical factory; led a branch of a technician and engineer refresher college; and worked extensively in the Institute of High-Voltage Current Technology for Industrial Use, exchanging and promoting the experiences of Stakhanovite workers. In 1940, when the Soviet Union established the national labor reserve system, he went to lead the Moscow No. 40 Metalworker Vocational School and chose this career as his lifelong profession. Within just nine years, this school cultivated more than two thousand skilled fitters and lathe operators for the Soviet motherland, contributing greatly to the Soviet Union's anti-fascist Patriotic War and post-war construction. Therefore, this school became a famous vocational school in Moscow. This book describes the experience created by Rakino in leading this school.

    Soviet Deputy Minister of Labor Reserves Ulasov said in the book's preface: "Rakino's book includes some of the most valuable and important materials from the collective educational work experience of their school. Without a doubt, these materials will provide the greatest help to the school leaders and staff of the labor reserve system in carrying out communist education and production education for the young reserve army of our country's working class." Our country's large-scale economic construction has already begun, and it is one of the most urgent tasks to cultivate a large number of young technical workers who can master the latest science and technology and love the motherland and the people; technical schools at all levels have been greatly developed in our country. Therefore, the materials recorded in this book will be of great help to our country's technical education work.

    The most noteworthy aspect of the successful experience of Rakino and the school he led is their specific combination of communist education and vocational technical education in the educational process. Lenin instructed at the Third All-Russian Congress of the Russian Communist Youth League in 1920: "It should be done so that the entire cause of education, training, and cultivating modern youth becomes the cause of cultivating communist morality among the youth." Rakino and others have well implemented Lenin's instructions. Rakino said: "Vocational and technical education enables young people to participate in the creative labor of the Soviet people, and this work itself is the best way to form young people's socialist consciousness. The foundation of this consciousness is laid in the classroom, in the factory, and in the workshops of large industries." Therefore, from the time students enter the school, they first tell them about the importance of the products manufactured by metalworkers in cultural and technological development. Secondly, they lead students on an imaginary journey: "Going to coal mines, mines, diving deep into the ocean in submarines, visiting factories, residences, hospitals, children's palaces, cinemas, theaters, farms, laboratories, climbing the derricks of oil wells and meteorological stations, and flying high in the sky on airplanes, they encounter the fruits of metalworkers' labor everywhere." In this way, they guide students to deeply understand the close relationship between the profession they are about to master and the construction and destiny of the Soviet motherland. On the one hand, they cultivate students' love for the motherland, and on the other hand, they cultivate students' sense of nobility and pride in their profession, thereby cultivating their love for their profession and for labor. In addition, regarding certain students' production of defective products, rework, waste of raw materials, damage to tools, and loafing, the book lists many examples, describing how they skillfully used various methods to guide students to recognize the losses these behaviors would cause to the country and Soviet society. As a result, students developed a high sense of responsibility for production plans, time, and product quality.

    Secondly, it is worth introducing that they have mastered the correct direction and done a good job in organizational work. The Soviet government instructed labor reserve schools to "not only require the adoption of the latest technology and the experience of Stakhanovite workers in the work of training young workers, and to organize all work in accordance with technical standards, but also to ensure that students can meet the work standards of adult workers when they complete their school education." Taking the Soviet government's instructions on the school's direction as guiding ideology, this book describes many specific methods for organizing the work and activities of teachers and students.

    For teachers, they regularly hold various technical or teaching conferences; and invite experts or professors to give reports to technical teachers. Teachers often visit museums, libraries, and bookstores to collect materials for the school's research office; visit advanced factories to study the experience of production innovators—Stakhanovite workers. In addition, they also regularly help individual teachers improve technical teaching and solve teaching difficulties. In this way, they united the teachers, improved the teachers' teaching level, and stimulated the teachers' enthusiasm, resulting in all technical teachers and cultural teachers being able to carry out their teaching work regularly and accurately.

    For students, they correctly organized the daily life system of labor and cultivated students' spirit of consciously abiding by discipline. They made students realize that abiding by school rules is abiding by national discipline; abiding by the order in school learning and production is abiding by the order of the country. They used Makarenko's theory—educating students to be individually responsible to the collective, and the collective responsible to the individual. They often invited Stakhanovite workers and technicians who created high labor productivity to talk to students about their creative work, in order to encourage young people to love labor, love their profession, and be proud of their profession. They also organized various competitions to arouse students' high enthusiasm for politics, production, and learning. They organized various technical discussions and thematic research seminars among students, and guided students to read books. All these activities of organizing and guiding students are promoted with the active members of the Communist Youth League as the core.

    Another noteworthy aspect is their appropriate use of educational skills and educational theories. Russian educator Ushinsky once said: Pedagogy is the most complex, profound, and necessary art. Rakino and others creatively mastered this art. They encountered many difficulties in their disciplinary work, but they successfully overcame them. For example, they used various different methods to teach students who violated discipline, did not work hard, or even stubbornly resisted school discipline. They often paid attention to the characteristics of each student and sought various educational methods. They focused on seeking positive qualities from so-called "difficult to educate" young people in order to encourage their aspirations to do good. They believed that when dealing with students who made mistakes or had shortcomings, they should first believe in them, and at the same time make them believe in themselves, and then patiently use the greatest ingenuity to support them and lead them. They regarded educating a young person who made a mistake or had shortcomings as seriously as solving the fate of Soviet youth, requiring each teacher to help him again and again. They encouraged students to join the Communist Youth League, so that students could correct their mistakes or shortcomings by striving to join the League, and make them progress under the League's education.

    Finally, it should also be pointed out that Rakino's success in technical education, in addition to the above reasons, has another most important reason, which is their understanding of the significance of their work in the entire national construction undertaking. Rakino said in the final conclusion of the book: "Our energy is used in the cause of cultivating the young generation of the working class, and we are helping the Party to cultivate loyal children of the motherland and builders of communist society. This awareness has always become the noblest encouragement for us in our difficult work."

    介绍“一个技术学校校长的手记”
    黄达三
    苏联　拉基诺著　吴　锋译　东北教育出版社出版
    “一个技术学校校长的手记”是一本对于我国各级技术教育工作者很有参考价值的书。
    本书作者拉基诺已有二十多年培养工业干部的工作经验。他做过电气工厂教育研究室的主任；领导过技师及技术员进修学院分院；在工业用高压电流技术研究所里作过很多交换与推广斯塔哈诺夫工作者经验的工作。在一九四○年苏联创建国家劳动后备制度的时候，他便去领导莫斯科市第四十金属工人职业学校，并把这个事业选定为自己的终生职业。这学校在短短九年内，为苏维埃祖国培植了两千以上的熟练的钳工和旋盘工，在苏联反法西斯的卫国战争和战后建设中贡献了很大的力量，因此这所学校也就成为莫斯科有名的职业学校。本书所写的，就是拉基诺领导这所学校所创造出来的经验。
    苏联劳动后备部副部长乌拉索夫在本书序言里说：“拉基诺这本书里，包括他们学校集体教育工作经验中的一些最有价值与最重要的资料。毫无疑问，这些资料会给劳动后备体系的学校领导工作人员，在对我国工人阶级青年后备军进行共产主义教育与生产教育上以最大的帮助。”我国大规模经济建设已经开始，大量培养能够掌握最新的科学技术，并且热爱祖国热爱人民的青年技术工作者，是当前迫切任务之一；各级技术学校已在我国大量发展。因此，本书所记述的资料，对我国技术教育工作将会有极大的帮助。
    拉基诺及他所领导的这座学校的成功经验中最值得介绍的，是他们在教育进程中具体结合了共产主义教育与职业技术教育。列宁一九二○年曾在俄国共产主义青年团第三次全国代表大会上指示：“应该做到使教育、训练和培养现代青年的全部事业，都成为在青年中养成共产主义道德的事业。”拉基诺等很好地执行了列宁的指示。拉基诺说：“职业技术教育，使青少年们参加苏维埃人民的创造性劳动，这种工作本身便是形成青年人社会主义觉悟的最好的办法。这种觉悟的基础，是在课堂上、在工厂和大工业的车间里奠定下来的。”因此，他们从学生入校时起，就先向学生们讲金属工人所制造出来的产品在文化与技术发展上的重要性。其次，他们领学生做想像旅行：“去到炭坑、矿山，乘潜水艇沉到海洋深处，参观工厂、住宅、病院、儿童宫、电影院、剧场、农庄、实验室，登上石油井的高架和气象台，坐飞机在高空飞翔，他们到处都碰到了金属工人的劳动成果。”他们就是这样地，引导学生深刻地认识了自己所要掌握的职业与苏维埃祖国的建设和命运的密切关系。他们一方面培养了学生对祖国的热爱，一方面培养了学生对自己职业的高贵感和自豪感，从而养成他们对自己职业和对劳动的热爱。此外，对于某些学生出废品、返工、浪费原料材料、破坏工具以及怠工等现象，书中曾列举了很多实例，描述他们如何巧妙地运用各种方法引导学生认识这些行为将会造成国家和苏维埃社会的损失。因之，学生们对生产计划、时间、产品质量都养成了高度负责的精神。
    其次值得介绍的是他们掌握了正确的方针，做好了组织工作。苏联政府曾指示劳动后备学校，“除了要求在培养青年工人的工作中要采用最新的技术科学与斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验，把一切工作都组织得合乎技术标准之外，还要求使学生受完学校教育时，能保证实现成年工人的工作标准。”以苏联政府对学校方针的指示为领导思想，本书叙述了很多组织教师和学生工作和活动的具体办法。
    对于教师，他们经常进行各种技术或教学的会议；并聘请专家或教授向技术教师们作报告。教师们时常参观博物馆、图书馆和书店，为学校研究室搜集材料；参观先进工厂，研究生产革新者——斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验。另外，他们还经常帮助个别教师改进技术教学和解决教学上的困难问题。这样他们就团结了教师，提高了教师的教学水平，发挥了教师们的积极性，结果使所有技术教师和文化教师都能够经常紧张而无误地进行着自己的教学工作。
    对于学生，他们正确地组织了劳动日的生活制度，培养了学生自觉遵守纪律的精神。他们使学生认识，遵守学校规则就是遵守国家纪律；遵守学校学习生产中的秩序，就是遵守国家的秩序。他们运用了马卡连柯的理论——教育学生个人对集体负责，集体对个人负责。他们时常邀请斯塔哈诺夫工作者和创造高度劳动生产率的技师来向学生们谈自己创造性的工作，以鼓舞青年们热爱劳动、热爱职业和对自己职业的自豪感。他们还组织各种竞赛，以引起学生对政治、生产和学习的高度热情。他们组织学生中的各种技术讨论会和专题研究会，并指导学生阅读书籍。这一切组织学生引导学生的活动，都是以共产主义青年团积极分子为核心而推动起来的。
    另外值得介绍的，是他们适当地运用了教育技巧和教育理论。俄罗斯教育家乌申斯基曾经说过：教育学是最复杂最高深而又是最必要的艺术。拉基诺等创造地掌握了这个艺术。他们在训导工作中曾遭遇到不少困难，但都顺利地将它们克服了。例如，他们曾使用各种不同的方法，教好违犯纪律、不努力工作甚至顽强抵抗学校纪律的学生。他们经常注意每个学生的特性，寻求各种教育方法。他们着重从所谓“难教育”的青年们身上去找寻积极的特质，借以鼓舞他们向善的志趣。他们认为对待犯错误或有缺点的学生，首先应该相信他们，同时使他们相信自己，再耐心地运用最大的机智去支持他们，领导他们。他们把教育一个犯错误或有缺点的青年，当作解决苏维埃青年的命运问题那样严重，要求每个教师必须一次再一次地帮助他。他们鼓励学生加入共产主义青年团，使学生以争取入团去纠正自己的错误或缺点，并使他们在团的教育下进步。
    最后还应该指出，拉基诺等在技术教育上的成功，除了上述原因以外，还有一个最重要的原因，就是他们对自己工作在整个国家建设事业中的意义的认识。拉基诺在本书最后的结语中说道：“我们的精力是用在培养青年一代工人阶级的事业上，我们是在帮助党来培养祖国的忠诚儿女、共产主义社会建设者。这种觉悟时时都成为我们在困难工作中的一种最高贵的鼓舞。”
