Title: Cadre Supply System Thinking in State-Owned Department Stores Leads to Negative Consequences: Blind Allocation of Goods Accumulates Large Amounts of State Funds

The blind allocation of goods by the China National Department Store and its branches and sub-branches is extremely serious. Large quantities of materials are transported back and forth, or are stockpiled in warehouses for long periods. This not only increases the commodity circulation costs of state-owned trade, but also accumulates a large amount of state funds, affecting the overall scheduling of state funds and causing huge losses to state wealth. These shortcomings have been gradually exposed in the company's industrial product promotion campaign, inventory clearance and queueing, criticism of supply system thinking, establishment of wholesale stations, and implementation of economic accounting, and deserve everyone's attention.

In March 1952, the Tianjin Department Store of China National Department Store allocated 200 automatic telephone sets to the original Pingyuan Province Department Store. These could not be used locally and had to be shipped back to Tianjin. After investigation, it was found that the allocation section of the head office saw that the Pingyuan Province company's purchase plan requested the allocation of 200 telephone sets. The cadres in the allocation section did not know what kind of telephone sets were in stock in Tianjin and blindly allocated them, wasting 1.8 million yuan in transportation costs. Without considering the mountainous terrain of the Southwest region, the China National Department Store transferred more than 15,000 bicycles to the Southwest region from May 1951 to June 1952. More than 5,000 bicycles are still unsold, keeping more than 10 billion yuan of funds tied up in warehouses for a long time. In the spring of 1952, the Shanxi Provincial Department Store, not understanding what the cotton farmers in the Yuncheng cotton-producing area actually needed, blindly allocated more than 200 boxes of 5 mm and 7 mm thick large glass, used for building construction, to the Yuncheng branch. The Yuncheng branch then allocated them to local department store groups in the same way, but not a single piece has been sold in a year. The phenomenon of roundabout transportation caused by various levels of department stores not understanding sales conditions is also very serious. In March 1952, the China National Department Store transferred 900 tons of imported sugar from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin. The Tianjin Department Store, not understanding market sales conditions, transferred all of the sugar to Dezhou. In August, sugar sales in Tianjin were brisk, so 600 tons were transferred back from Dezhou. The round trip of 600 tons of sugar wasted more than 210 million yuan in transportation costs.

Because of untimely allocation, department stores in various regions have created many phenomena of "summer singlets arriving in autumn, and winter woolens arriving as winter leaves." For example, in August 1952, the Tianjin Department Store transferred more than 1,300 mosquito nets from Shanghai. In January 1952, the Shanxi Provincial Department Store transferred in 8,000 pounds of wool yarn, which were all packed and stored.

The main reason for the above serious phenomena is that the cadres of the state-owned department store sector have not truly recognized that the state-owned trade system should better meet the needs of the people and should save funds for the state in order to promote the country's industrial construction. Therefore, their sense of responsibility at work is very low. The commodity allocation plans of companies at all levels are mostly formulated by clerks and staff members of the planning section sitting in the office. They do not conduct in-depth investigations and studies of the needs of the masses, but only rely on subjective assumptions and "experience" to make plans, which of course will lead to errors. The heads and managers of the company's planning sections rarely study the plans, so many clerks reflect: "The section chief sits in town, and the clerks run the house." Once the plan is made, the section chief approves it, and then the department head and manager approve it layer by layer. Although they have done some investigations, they are often not thorough and detailed enough, and such plans become a formality. At the same time, many cadres also have a supply system mentality of "the meat rots in the pot." They often think this way: anyway, the goods are stockpiled in the warehouse, and it's all public property, as long as there is no shortage. Some transportation costs were spent, but spent on the state-owned railway bureau, and the bank just transfers an account. They occupy a large amount of funds, but do not try to vigorously promote the sale of goods. They ask for money from higher authorities when they have no money, and turn over money to higher authorities when they have money. They even think: "Even people are public property, what's so great about it!" Therefore, the amount of stockpiling expands year by year, the turnover rate of funds decreases year by year, and the expense rate becomes higher and higher.

Leading cadres of the state-owned department store system in various regions must face these phenomena squarely, fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly expose errors in their work, strictly criticize supply system thinking, and complete the tasks given by the state and meet the people's needs for department stores through inventory clearance, formulation of plans, verification of funds, establishment of wholesale stations, and implementation of economic accounting systems.

### 国营百货公司干部供给制思想造成恶果  盲目调拨商品积压了大量国家资金

    国营百货公司干部供给制思想造成恶果
    盲目调拨商品积压了大量国家资金
    中国百货公司及其分、支公司，盲目地调拨商品的现象十分严重。大批物资被运来运去，或长期被积压在仓库里。这不但使国营贸易的商品流转费用增加了，而且积压了国家大量资金，影响了整个国家资金的调度，使国家财富遭受巨大的损失。这些缺点在该公司开展工业品推销运动、清仓排队、批判供给制思想、建立批发站、实行经济核算的过程中陆续被揭发出来，值得大家注意。
    中国百货公司在一九五二年三月份由天津市百货公司拨给原平原省百货公司自动电话机二百架，当地根本不能使用，只好再运回天津。后来追查原因，是因为总公司调拨科看到原平原省公司进货计划上要求调拨电话机二百架，调拨科干部不了解天津存的是什么电话机，就盲目地调拨去了，这样就浪费了运费一百八十万元。中国百货公司没有考虑到西南区多山的情况，在一九五一年五月至一九五二年六月先后调往西南区自行车一万五千多辆，至今还有五千多辆卖不出去，把一百多亿元资金长期积压在仓库里。一九五二年春天，山西省百货公司因不了解运城产棉区的棉农到底需要什么东西，就盲目地把修建大楼用的五公厘和七公厘厚的大玻璃，拨给运城分公司二百多箱，运城分公司又照样拨给所属各地百货小组，一年来连一块也未销出去。各级百货公司由于不了解销售情况而造成的迂回运输的现象也很严重。一九五二年三月份中国百货总公司把从秦皇岛进口的砂糖九百吨调到天津，天津市百货公司不了解市场销售情况，将这批砂糖全部调往德州，八月份天津食糖畅销，又从德州调回六百吨，六百吨糖往返旅行一次，就浪费了运费二亿一千多万元。
    各地百货公司因为调拨不及时，造成了许多“秋来汗衫到，冬去绒衣来”的现象。例如，一九五二年八月，天津市百货公司从上海调进蚊帐一千三百多顶。一九五二年一月，山西省百货公司调进八千磅毛线，都装箱存起来了。
    造成上述严重现象的主要原因，是国营百货部门的干部没有真正认识国营贸易系统应该更好地满足人民的需要，应该给国家节省资金，以便推进国家的工业建设，因此，他们的工作责任心是很低的。各级公司的商品调拨计划，大部分是由计划科科员、办事员坐在办公室里订的。他们不深入调查研究群众的需要，只是凭着主观的推断，凭着“经验”来订计划，当然要发生错误。公司的计划科长、经理也很少研究计划，所以不少科员反映：“科长坐镇，科员当家”。计划订好了，科长一定批准，接着处长、经理也就层层照准。虽然他们也曾作过些调查，但常常不够深入细致，这样的计划就变成形式了。同时，许多干部还有一种“肉烂在锅里”的供给制思想。他们往往这样想：反正货物压在仓库里也是公家的，只要不缺少就行了。花了一些运费，花给公家的铁路局，银行转一笔账就行了。他们占用了大量资金，但不想办法大力推销商品，他们是没有钱就向上级要，有了钱就向上级缴。他们甚至这样想：“连人都是公家的，有什么了不起！”因此积压数量一年年扩大，资金的周转率年年降低，费用率越来越高。
    各地国营百货系统领导干部必须正视这些现象，充分发动群众，彻底揭发工作中的错误，严格批判供给制思想，通过清理库存，制定计划，核定资金，建立批发站，实行经济核算制，完成国家给予的任务，满足人民对百货的需求。
