Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and fourteen Christian churches and Christian organizations, including the Christian Holy City New Church, sent telegrams to U.S. President Truman on the 10th, protesting the U.S. government's illegal persecution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Christian organizations in Wuhan jointly issued a statement protesting the U.S. government's barbaric act of fabricating charges and sentencing the Rosenbergs to death.

The telegram from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to Truman stated: The American judicial authorities fabricated "espionage" charges to frame Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, sentencing them to death. The American judicial authorities have been unable to produce any evidence to prove the Rosenbergs' alleged "espionage crimes," but they have stubbornly refused to retry the case, insisting on upholding the original death sentence. U.S. New York Federal Judge Irving Kaufman has admitted that the entire case is a political persecution, believing that the Rosenbergs committed "crimes of thought and belief." This is clearly a deliberate murder of progressive Americans. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representing all Chinese literary and art workers, lodges a serious protest against the American judicial authorities' barbaric act of violating human justice and trampling on human rights, and demands that you immediately revoke the illegal sentence against the Rosenbergs and restore their freedom!

The joint telegram to Truman from the Christian Holy City New Church, the North China Methodist Episcopal Church of the Chinese Christian Church, the Beijing YMCA, Beijing Yenching School of Religion, the Hebei Association of the Church of Christ in China, the North China Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, the North China Assemblies of God, the Chinese Salvation Army, the Beijing YWCA, the General Assembly of the Chinese Holy Church, the Beijing Christian Home Evangelistic Association, the True Jesus Church, the North China Congregational Church of Christ, and the Beijing Chinese Anglican Church stated: The U.S. government's illegal sentencing of the Rosenbergs to death is without any factual basis. This attempt to persecute the American people's struggle for peace and democracy is intolerable to us peace-loving Christians. Therefore, our Beijing Christian churches and Christian organizations fully sympathize with the American people's struggle to protect human rights and strive for the release of the wrongly accused Rosenbergs. We resolutely express our righteous support for the peace-loving Rosenbergs and demand that the U.S. government revoke the illegal sentence against the Rosenbergs and immediately restore their freedom.

The joint statement from the Anglican Diocese of Hubei and Hunan, the Hubei Assembly of the Church of Christ in China, the Hubei Diocese of the Chinese Methodist Church, the National Synod of the Chinese Evangelical Lutheran Church, the National General Assembly of the China Inland Mission, the Central China Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, the Hubei Provincial Branch of the True Jesus Church, the Wuhan Joint Association of the True Jesus Church, the Wuhan China Assemblies of God, the Hankou Faith Assemblies of God, the Wuhan China Gospel Road Lutheran Church, the Hankou Church Assembly Place, the Wuchang Church Assembly Place, the Hankou YMCA, the Wuhan YWCA, the Wuchang YMCA, the Hankou Jesus Family, the Central China Branch of the Chinese Bible Society, and the Hankou Chinese Christian Sacred Teaching Bookstore stated: The reactionary American government, disregarding the protests of the peace-loving people of the United States, sentenced the peace-loving, kind, and innocent people of the United States, the Rosenbergs, to death on a fabricated "trumped-up" charge. This barbaric, shameless, and despicable act has shocked and angered all clergy and staff of the church organizations in Wuhan. We firmly oppose and protest the reactionary American government's act of strangling democracy and violating human rights.

As everyone knows, this trial by the American government was conducted without any scientific evidence, fabricating the so-called "crime" of "conspiring to supply the Soviet Union with materials about the atomic bomb." This is part of a vile and despicable anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracy; it is a threat to the people who are striving for progress, democracy, and peace; it is clear evidence that the American government has declared democracy, freedom, human rights, and peace to be illegal acts in the United States. We Christians believe that this fascist means of the American government is completely contrary to justice and tramples on human rights, so we firmly oppose it and lodge a serious protest. We demand the unconditional release of the Rosenbergs so that they can return home and live a free life. At the same time, we also express our deep sympathy to the American people who are striving for peace and democracy, and we are willing to fully support your just actions to strive for the release of the Rosenbergs.

    严重抗议美国政府非法迫害罗森堡夫妇
    据新华社讯：中华全国文学艺术界联合会和基督教圣城新教会等十四个基督教会及基督教团体十日分别致电美国总统杜鲁门，抗议美国政府非法迫害朱利叶斯·罗森堡夫妇。武汉市各基督教团体联合发表声明，抗议美国政府捏造罪名判处罗森堡夫妇死刑的野蛮行为。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会致杜鲁门的电文称：美国司法当局以捏造的“间谍”罪名诬陷朱利叶斯·罗森堡夫妇，将他们判处死刑。美国司法当局一直拿不出任何证据来证明罗森堡夫妇被诬告的所谓“间谍罪行”，却蛮横地拒绝重审这个案件，坚持维持死刑原判。美国纽约联邦法官欧温·考夫曼已经承认整个案件是一个政治迫害，他认为罗森堡夫妇犯的是“思想与信仰上的罪行”。这显然是对美国进步人士的一种蓄意谋杀。中华全国文学艺术界联合会代表全中国文学艺术工作者，对美国司法当局这种违反人类正义、蹂躏人权的野蛮行为提出严重的抗议，并要求你立即撤销对罗森堡夫妇的非法判决，恢复他们的自由！
    基督教圣城新教会、中华基督教华北卫理公会、北京基督教青年会、北京燕京宗教学院、中华基督教会河北协会、安息日会华北联合会、华北神召会、中华救世军、北京基督教女青年会、中华圣洁教会总会、北京市基督徒家庭布道会、真耶稣教会、华北基督教公理会、北京中华圣公会联名致杜鲁门的电文称：美国政府非法地判决罗森堡夫妇死刑，是毫无事实根据的，这种企图迫害美国人民争取和平与民主的阴谋，是我们爱好和平的基督徒所不能容忍的。因此，我们北京市基督教会及基督教各团体完全同情美国人民为保障人权、争取释放蒙受冤屈的罗森堡夫妇而进行的斗争，我们坚决地对和平人士罗森堡夫妇表示正义的声援，并要求美国政府撤销对罗森堡夫妇的非法判决，立即恢复他们的自由。
    中华圣公会鄂湘教区、中华基督教会湖北大会、中华基督教循道公会湖北教区、中国基督教信义会全国总会、中国基督教宣道会全国总会、基督复临安息日会华中联合会、真耶稣教会湖北省支会、真耶稣教会武汉联合会、武汉中国神召会、汉口信心神召会、武汉中国福音道路德会、汉口教会聚会处、武昌教会聚会处、汉口基督教青年会、武汉基督教女青年会、武昌基督教青年会、汉口耶稣家庭、中华圣经会华中分会、汉口中国基督圣教书会的联合声明称：美国反动政府不顾美国爱好和平人民的抗议，以一个“莫须有”的罪名，将美国爱好和平的善良无辜的人民罗森堡夫妇判处死刑，这一野蛮、无耻、卑鄙的行为，引起我武汉市各教会团体全体教友及工作人员的震惊和愤怒；我们坚决反对和抗议美国反动政府扼杀民主、侵犯人权的行为。
    众所周知，美国政府的这次审判，是在毫无科学的证据，凭空捏造所谓“阴谋供给苏联关于原子弹的材料”的“罪名”下进行的。这是卑鄙龌龊的反苏反共阴谋的一部分；是对争取进步、民主、和平的人民的威胁；是美国政府宣布民主、自由、人权及和平等在美国为犯法行为的明证。我们基督徒认为美国政府这种法西斯手段是完全违反正义、蹂躏人权的，因此我们坚决地反对、并提出严重的抗议。我们要求无条件地释放罗森堡夫妇，使他们回家过自由的生活。同时，我们也向正在为争取和平、民主的美国人民表示深切的同情，并愿全力支援你们争取释放罗森堡夫妇的正义行动。
