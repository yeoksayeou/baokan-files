Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 30th: The Korean People's Army anti-aircraft units and the Chinese People's Volunteers anti-aircraft units, fighting shoulder to shoulder, have dealt a heavy blow to the invading American air force. In the past year, anti-aircraft gunners stationed on a certain front in the Korean People's Army shot down approximately 500 enemy planes. Anti-aircraft gunners in the unit to which Park Byung-sik belongs have shot down more than 260 enemy planes in the most recent thirteen months.

The glorious achievements of the Korean People's Army anti-aircraft fighters are the result of combining their heroism and wisdom. On July 11th of last year, during a large-scale bombing by the American air force of the peaceful residents of Pyongyang, a certain unit of the Korean People's Army anti-aircraft artillery defending the Pyongyang area used concentrated fire and sniping tactics to fight the enemy planes for an entire day, shooting down fifteen enemy planes. The commander of this unit, Li Yun-cheng, was awarded the title of "Hero of the Republic" for this. The Hong Cheng-han anti-aircraft firing team of a certain unit used clever tactics to lure enemy planes into the firepower circle of light and heavy machine guns, and then concentrated their fire. They fought twenty-three enemy planes in two days, shooting down or damaging more than half of them.

The heroic Korean People's Army anti-aircraft gunners do not relax their vigilance against the American bandits carrying out nighttime bombing. The Li Chun-gen anti-aircraft firing team, which shot down seven enemy planes in three consecutive battles, recently shot down another enemy plane at night. The female soldiers of the Li Ming-suk anti-aircraft firing team, who shot down six enemy planes, recently shot down an enemy night bomber with heavy machine guns, and then shot down another enemy plane on another night.

    朝鲜人民军防空部队严惩美国空中强盗
    布防在某战线上的空防战士去年打落敌机约五百架
    【新华社平壤三十日电】朝鲜人民军防空部队和中国人民志愿军防空部队并肩作战，给了进犯的美国空军以沉重的打击。在去年一年中，布防在某战线上的朝鲜人民军对空射击手们打落敌机约五百架。朴炳植所属部队的对空射击手们在最近的十三个月中打落的敌机共有二百六十多架。
    朝鲜人民军空防战士能够取得这样光辉的战绩，是他们的英勇和智慧相结合的结果。防守平壤地区的朝鲜人民军高射炮部队某部在去年七月十一日美国空军对平壤市和平居民进行大轰炸时，以集中猛射和冷枪射击等战术，和敌机作战了一整天，打落敌机十五架。这个部队的指挥员李云成因此荣获“共和国英雄”的称号。某部洪成汉对空射击组使用巧妙战术吸引敌机冲入轻重机枪的火力圈，然后集中轰击。他们曾在两天中先后和二十三架敌机作战，打落打伤了其中的一半以上。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军对空射击手们对于进行夜间轰炸的美国强盗也毫不放松。曾经在接连三次的战斗中打落敌机七架的李春根对空射击组，不久以前在夜间又打落了一架敌机。曾打落敌机六架的李明淑女对空射击组的女战士们，在不久以前用重机枪打落敌夜间轰炸机一架，接着，又在另一个晚上打落敌机一架。
