    Children Should Not Be Assigned to Winter Defense Night Patrols
    A Suggestion to the Wuhan Municipal Government to Stop This Phenomenon
    To the Editor: Recently, residents of various streets in Wuhan often assign children to winter defense night patrol duties. This not only fails to effectively complete the winter defense task, but also hinders children's health and studies. Zeng, a resident of No. 21 Wanshou Street, Jianghan District, asked Xu Neng, a 14-year-old child, to keep watch at night; Guo Xibing, a 13-year-old child living at No. 1 Fujian Street, was also asked to keep watch at night. In the sixth grade of the Second Elementary School of Hankou, Wuhan, more than one-third of the forty-three children are performing night patrol duties at home. Although each household only takes duty once every half month or month, this is a demanding job that should be handled by adults. It is inappropriate to push it onto children. I suggest that the Wuhan Municipal People's Government find a way to stop this phenomenon.

    Editor's Note: Why do many residents in Wuhan assign children to winter defense night patrol duties? Why don't they take a proactive and responsible attitude to protect themselves and their city, and instead take a perfunctory attitude, asking children to fill in and cope? The occurrence of this phenomenon is obviously due to the Wuhan Municipal People's Government's lack of in-depth publicity regarding the implementation of mass winter defense work, resulting in some residents not having sufficient understanding of winter defense work. Moreover, the cadres responsible for implementing the work are not good at using mass work methods to mobilize the masses. Therefore, in order to fulfill the tasks assigned by their superiors, these residents naturally resorted to the phenomenon of filling in with unqualified personnel, thereby preventing the winter defense work from achieving its due effect. We suggest that the Wuhan Municipal People's Government promptly investigate and correct the phenomenon of children substituting for adults in winter defense night patrol duties.

    不应让儿童担当冬防夜巡工作
    建议武汉市政府制止这种现象
    编辑同志：武汉市各街道的居民，近来常有叫儿童担任冬防夜巡工作，这不仅不能很好地完成冬防的任务，而且会妨碍儿童的健康和学习。江汉区万寿街第二十一号居民曾叫十四岁儿童徐能进去守夜；福建街一号居民也叫十三岁儿童郭锡炳去守夜；武汉市汉口第二十小学六下年级，四十三个儿童中，在家担任夜巡工作的，就有三分之一以上。虽然每户仅半月或一月值勤一次，但这是一种责任繁重的工作，应该由成人来担任才对，把它推到儿童身上去是不合适的。我建议武汉市人民政府设法制止这种现象。　　　王　彬
    编者按：武汉市为什么有许多居民叫儿童担任冬防夜巡工作？为什么他们不以积极负责的态度担当起保卫自己和自己城市的工作，而以敷衍塞责的态度叫儿童去顶差应付？所以发生这种现象，显然是由于武汉市人民政府对开展群众性的冬防工作没有作深入的宣传，致使一些居民对冬防工作没有足够的认识；而执行工作的干部又不善于用群众工作的方法来发动群众，因此，这些居民为了执行上级的任务，自然就发生了顶差应付现象，从而使冬防工作不能收到应有的效果。我们建议武汉市人民政府迅速检查并纠正儿童顶替成人担当冬防夜巡工作的现象。
