Report on Current Women's Work Issues
(Report at the National Women's Work Conference, approved by the Fourth Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation on December 10, 1952)
Zhang Yun, Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

(I) Assessment of National Women's Work

Since the Enlarged Third Executive Committee Meeting of the All-China Women's Federation in the autumn of 1950, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the coordination and assistance of all relevant parties, and the active efforts of all women cadres, national women's work has made significant progress and development. Women's grassroots organizations have been widely established in vast rural areas, and the vast majority of urban housewives and female workers have been organized. The broad masses of women, shoulder to shoulder with men, have actively participated in a series of great mass movements such as land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, increasing production and practicing economy, and ideological remolding, playing a huge role, and women themselves have been tempered in the movements. At the same time, in conjunction with this series of movements, widespread education on gender equality and the struggle against feudal remnants of thought and customs that valued men over women have been carried out in society, and cultural learning work for the masses of women has been launched. As a result, whether in urban or rural areas, new or old liberated areas, women's political, ideological, and cultural levels have greatly improved, and women's status in both the family and society has undergone significant changes.

However, on a national scale, the development of women's work is still uneven. The grassroots organizations in many places are still very unsound or exist only in name, and there are still a few areas where organizations have not yet been established. Maternal and child health and childcare work are far from keeping up with the needs of women's participation in production and learning. Significant remnants of old consciousness obstruct and resist the progress of women's work. The self-education and self-transformation work of the masses of women has not been deep or broad enough. Women's organizations have not played their due role in safeguarding women's rights effectively enough, and their work in assisting the government to implement gender equality policies and making them deeply rooted in people's hearts has not been sufficient. Therefore, a large amount of potential strength remains untapped and unabsorbed into national construction among the broad masses of women. Our tasks are still very long-term and arduous. All levels of women's federations and women across the country must make greater efforts to further advance women's work under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

(II) On the New Tasks of Women's Work in the Current New Situation

Our great motherland has entered a new historical period. The three years of preparation work instructed by Chairman Mao have been completed, and large-scale planned economic construction and cultural construction will begin while continuing to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Women in New China are an indispensable force in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and building the motherland, and the democratic women's federation, which focuses on female workers, peasant women, and other working women and serves the entire female population, is the backbone of this force. Therefore, in the face of the new tasks in this new period, in addition to continuing to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea until the final victory, the Women's Federation must further mobilize and organize women to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production and cultural learning, and actively participate in various tasks of national construction, thereby actively and step by step resolving the special and vital interests of women. This is the general task and policy of current women's work. In order to achieve this general task and policy, the focus of women's work is:

First, mobilize the broad masses of women to actively participate in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, national construction, and other central tasks, and strive to achieve results, in order to enhance women's confidence and gain everyone's trust in women, and use this to practically educate those who discriminate against women and do not value women's work.

Second, in a planned way, combine the current central tasks to strengthen cultural, political education, and ideological remolding work among the masses of women. Because the patriarchal society that has existed for thousands of years has created a dependence mentality, conservative ideas, a sense of inferiority, and a lack of knowledge among the masses of women, which still seriously affect their consciousness and progress.

Third, further eliminate the feudal ideas and customs that still exist in the old society and bind women, such as arranged and mercenary marriages, the bad habits of beating and abusing wives and daughters-in-law, and discriminatory views against women, in order to remove objective obstacles for women to participate in work and learning.

Fourth, vigorously and as much as possible assist health departments in carrying out maternal and child health and childcare work, in order to meet the needs of national economic and cultural construction, and create conditions for the broad masses of women to go to production and learning.

Fifth, strengthen the organization of the Women's Federation, further exert its role, improve the leadership institutions of women's federations at all levels, and step up the training of cadres to meet the needs of current work tasks.

(III) Opinions on Several Issues in Current Women's Work:

First, on urban women's work:

(1) On strengthening the leadership of urban women's work: Since the National Women's Federation's Propaganda and Education Conference proposed that the target of women's work should be mainly working women (including housewives) from the working class, peasantry, and petty bourgeoisie, the work for the broad masses of housewives in cities has attracted attention from all over the country, and there has been great development and achievements in the past year or so. Many problems have been solved in terms of work content, organizational forms, and working methods. In order to meet the needs of the work, and in view of the complexity of urban women's work, women's federations above the provincial level should assign cadres to establish departments specifically in charge of urban work to strengthen the leadership of urban women's work.

(2) On women's labor employment issues: Large-scale economic and cultural construction will open up broad avenues for women's labor employment, but a comprehensive solution to the employment problem must be long-term. The Women's Federation should, on the one hand, in accordance with the needs of national construction, plan to mobilize women to participate in various learning organizations, improve their cultural, political, and ideological levels, cultivate work skills, prepare for employment, and send them to work positions; on the other hand, under the leadership and support of relevant national production, trade, and cooperative agencies, and based on different specific conditions, organize urban women to engage in marketable handicraft production on the basis of household handicraft industry. For those housewives who cannot go to social labor for the time being, call on them to do a good job of housework, take good care of their children, and help the family members who participate in social labor to better engage in production and work. This kind of housework is still needed today and is directly and indirectly beneficial to social production.

(3) On the work of workers' families: Workers' families account for a very large proportion of the urban population, and they are closely related to the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. Experience has shown that wherever workers' families have been united and educated, their awareness has been raised, and they have been promoted to help each other and solve some daily difficulties, and the work of workers' families has been done well, workers can concentrate on production, exert their production enthusiasm, and improve labor efficiency. Therefore, the work of workers' families is an important part of urban women's work. However, in the past, in the work of workers' families, there was a division of labor between the Women's Federation and the Trade Union, but there was insufficient cooperation, resulting in the phenomenon of the work of workers' families being separated from the work of the Trade Union and production tasks. This needs to be further explored in practice by urban women's federations in cooperation with trade unions to solve it.

In addition, in order to ensure the health and production morale of female workers, special attention should be paid to educating female workers' families, improving female workers' economic rights and status in the family, and helping female workers' family members to achieve appropriate division of labor, reducing unnecessary housework for female workers, so as to avoid excessive fatigue for female workers and affect production.

(4) On the work of female workers: The work of female workers is part of the work of the trade union, and the trade union has a female workers' department specifically in charge of the work of female workers. The responsibility of the Women's Federation lies in assisting, suggesting, and urging the trade union to strengthen the work of female workers and rationally solve the special difficulties and welfare issues of female workers. Therefore, the Women's Federation should always be concerned about the establishment, improvement, and work of the trade union's female workers' department, jointly study the work of female workers with the female workers' department, and at any time consult with the trade union to help the trade union carry out women's work that is not within the scope of general trade union work and solve the special problems of female workers. Some municipal women's federations have clarified the above-mentioned mutual relationship and certain working methods of the trade union, the trade union's female workers' department, and the Women's Federation in the work of female workers, and have achieved certain results; however, many municipal women's federations are not good at doing this, and they should seriously study and thoroughly solve this problem in the future.

Facts have proved that the wisdom and talent of female workers are no less than those of male workers. For example, finding tricks, creating new working methods, and participating in trade union work have all produced many extremely prominent examples among female workers. However, the progress and development of female workers are more unbalanced than that of male workers, and many female workers still maintain quite serious old ideas of despising labor and relying on men. The Women's Federation should suggest to the trade union that strengthening the ideological education of female workers in light of their ideological situation should be an important part of worker education. In general activities of all workers, attention should be paid to absorbing female workers to participate, and the form of female worker representative meetings should be used as much as possible under possible conditions to strengthen the work of female workers.

Secondly, assist the trade union to solve the special problems of female workers such as lack of freedom of marriage, family oppression, burden of children, pregnancy, lactation, and women's diseases as much as possible. Many factories, because they do not pay attention to solving the special problems of female workers, have seriously affected the physical and mental health of female workers, the absenteeism rate of female workers has increased, which in turn has greatly affected production.

Second, on women's work in rural production movements:

(1) Assisting farmers' organizations and agricultural production leadership agencies to further mobilize women to participate in agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation, and helping women overcome difficulties and problems in production and mutual aid and cooperation, in order to enhance the strength of the patriotic production increase movement and promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This is the primary task in current rural women's work.

(2) Women's federations in various regions should, in light of the current different situations of women's participation in agricultural labor in several regions, closely combine with production to gradually solve the vital requirements of women. First, in areas where women have extensively participated in agricultural labor and a considerable part have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, but their economic and democratic rights in the family and mutual aid and cooperation organizations and freedom of political activities have not been fully resolved or not resolved at all, in addition to continuing to call on and organize women to develop production and improve production technology, efforts should be focused on carrying out gender equality education in society, loudly proposing that men and women work together and enjoy together, and through women's own struggle, resolving women's economic and democratic rights in the production movement, in order to promote the production movement. Second, in areas where women generally did not participate in major agricultural labor in the past but have now begun to participate in major agricultural labor and have begun to participate in seasonal mutual aid organizations, but they do not have economic and democratic rights in mutual aid organizations and families, women should be mobilized to participate in major agricultural labor as much as possible, and given education on the prospects of organizing them and collectivism, and the issue of women's democratic and equal rights should be resolved in conjunction with the production movement, and at the same time, democratic education on gender equality should be carried out in society, in order to mobilize the potential labor force of women and further develop agricultural production. Third, in areas where women have never participated or rarely participated in agricultural labor, the main task is to educate women to participate in agricultural labor and strive for equal rights. Agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations should also absorb them to participate according to women's requirements, but they cannot be rushed.

(3) Should seriously study and appropriately solve the special problems related to women's labor in the current mutual aid and cooperation organizations: First of all, efforts should be made to achieve equal pay for equal work for men and women, and to oppose the views and unreasonable methods of belittling women's labor by not recording points, recording fewer points, or recording the same points for men and women but with different point values. At the same time, men and women should enjoy equal democratic rights in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations with a considerable number of women members should absorb activists who are good at labor and care about the masses of women to participate in leadership and participate in the management of the team (community), in order to closely contact women team (community) members and appropriately solve their special requirements.

In addition, as women widely participate in agricultural production, the contradiction between agricultural labor and housework is raised. We believe that on the one hand, this contradiction should be resolved conditionally, gradually, and appropriately. Women should not be completely bound by housework, such as running simple nurseries during the busy farming season, and dividing the working time of the day into several sections and reasonably setting points for each section, so that female community members can participate in agricultural labor and also take care of the necessary housework, or help female team (community) members to carry out planned and appropriate division of labor among their family members, so that female team (community) members can have time to participate in agricultural production, and other methods can be promoted. On the other hand, education must be carried out in society to explain that housework is an indispensable labor for society, and certain family handicraft labor is also an indispensable labor for society under the current conditions, breaking the erroneous concept of not recognizing the results of housework and family handicraft labor, and thus discriminating against women and not giving women equal political and economic democratic rights. For women with many children and heavy housework, they should not be forced to participate too much in agricultural labor.

Third, on women's work in minority ethnic regions:

Women's work in minority ethnic regions cannot be separated from ethnic and religious policies. General instructions and decisions on women's work cannot be fully applied to minority ethnic regions. In the future, women's federations in various ethnic regions should conduct in-depth research on the situation in each region and propose specific plans for the local Party committees and higher-level women's federations to study. The National Women's Federation and provincial and municipal women's federations in multi-ethnic regions should equip a certain number of full-time cadres to strengthen the study of women's work in minority ethnic groups.

Fourth, on assisting the government in carrying out the Marriage Law campaign:

One of the tasks of the Women's Federation is to actively fight for the maintenance of women's rights, for the realization of gender equality, and for the elimination of feudal remnants of thought and bad habits that value men over women. Therefore, we must seriously study the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on implementing the Marriage Law, and in accordance with the spirit of the instructions, combine with the different situations in various regions to assist the Party and the People's Government in launching a nationwide campaign to implement the Marriage Law. In areas where freedom of marriage has been basically achieved, autonomous marriage accounts for the vast majority, new democratic and harmonious families and model couples continue to emerge, and phenomena of beating and abusing women and deaths due to marriage problems are rare (basically old liberated areas and individual key demonstration new liberated areas), we must strictly guard against complacency, conduct in-depth inspections, consolidate achievements, eliminate the remnants of the feudal marriage system, and establish a completely new marriage system. In areas where semi-autonomous marriage accounts for the majority, free marriage is less common, arranged and mercenary marriages, early marriage, and child brides are also less common, and phenomena of beating and abusing women still exist and deaths due to marriage problems still occur (part of old liberated areas and new liberated areas liberated earlier), we must vigorously publicize the Marriage Law, advocate autonomous marriage, recognize the progressiveness of semi-autonomous marriage but at the same time point out its shortcomings, and actively abolish arranged and mercenary marriages and oppose the bad habit of abusing women. In areas where feudal mercenary and arranged marriages still account for the vast majority, freedom of marriage is interfered with, and cases of women's suicide and murder continue to occur (the vast majority of new liberated areas and remote villages in old liberated areas), we must vigorously publicize the Marriage Law, first stop deaths, and oppose abuse and murder of women and interference with freedom of marriage.

Women's federations at all levels should become capable assistants to the Party and the People's Government in launching the large-scale campaign to implement the Marriage Law in March 1953. To this end, the following preparations should be made immediately:

(1) The cadres of the Women's Federation system must first study the Marriage Law carefully and meticulously, combine with their thoughts and work, check whether they have violated the Marriage Law, and lay an ideological foundation for the campaign month and prepare organizational strength.

(2) Through women's representative meetings, widely and correctly publicize the Marriage Law and the principles and policies of the campaign to implement the Marriage Law among the masses of women.

(3) Actively participate in pilot projects in the preparatory work, and systematically collect typical materials on marriage cases and study them.

(4) Assign capable cadres to participate in the work of the local People's Government's unified Marriage Law Implementation Committee and its office, and under the general plan, exert the role of the entire organization of the Women's Federation and complete the due tasks.

(5) Vigorously assist the government in training judicial cadres to handle marriage cases and cadres to handle marriage registration work, and systematically send women cadres to work in the judicial departments of the People's Government.

Fifth, maternal and child health and childcare work:

Women's federations at all levels should assist health departments as much as possible in carrying out maternal and child health and childcare work, in order to meet the needs of national construction. Although there is some foundation for this work in various regions, there are still some shortcomings, such as insufficient publicity on disinfection methods for childbirth and infant care knowledge. Women's federation cadres themselves have not studied it well, so naturally they cannot publicize it well to the masses; some places still regard this work as purely the business of business departments, and the Women's Federation rarely asks about it. This is not allowed. It must be recognized that maternal and child health work is a major event related to "saving lives" and has a direct role in protecting productivity. In the future, leading cadres and general cadres of women's federations at all levels, especially grassroots cadres, should all understand the basic common sense of maternal and child health and become promoters of maternal and child health work and assistants to health departments in effectively guiding and inspecting maternal and child health work. Women's federations at all levels should systematically train a large number of midwifery personnel and transform and train old midwives. For those who have been trained, we should seize the organization and leadership, strengthen ideological education and cooperate with health departments to give business guidance, so as to avoid self-flow. Women's federations at all levels should negotiate with health departments to formulate maternal and child health work plans that are suitable for the current conditions and ensure their effective implementation; it is recommended that health departments cooperate closely with women's federations to better combine maternal and child health services with mass demands and mass movements.

In terms of childcare work, we should continue to implement the policy of serving the broad masses of working women and their children decided at the 1951 National Women's Federation Women and Children Welfare Work Conference. The main task is to rely on the strength of the masses themselves to develop a large number of mass-based simple nurseries and nursery stations that meet the requirements of the masses, are suitable for various different conditions, are diverse, of varying sizes, and have varying standards. Regular nurseries should be run according to their capabilities, and high-level forms and regularization should not be mechanically required. Systematically training childcare workers and universally publicizing childcare knowledge according to actual needs are the basic requirements of current childcare work.

Sixth, on organizational issues:

In order to adapt to the new situation and do the above work well, the Women's Federation must strengthen its organization and leadership in the following three aspects:

(1) Improve the leadership institutions of women's federations at all levels. In addition to equipping cadres and trying to fill all positions, women's federations at all levels should allocate a certain number of core and backbone personnel, improve working systems, and strengthen organization and planning in work.

(2) Strengthen the training of cadres and improve the quality of cadres. From the National Women's Federation to women's federations at all levels, under the unified planning and leadership of the Central Committee and local Party committees, a learning system should be established, regular and systematic learning should be carried out, and a determination should be made to learn well. Cadres at all levels should be systematically trained in rotation. In addition to consulting with relevant parties to appropriately stipulate the number of women and the necessary women's work content in the plan to train cadres, county-level women's federations can organize women's work conferences as an auxiliary training method to train grassroots cadres. Women cadres above the district level shall be trained in rotation by the provinces, the Great Administrative Regions and the National Women's Federation in a planned way.

(3) Strengthen and reorganize grassroots organizations. The grassroots representative meeting should have a regular and necessary number of meeting systems, and the committee should regularly contact representatives and guide representatives to carry out work.

The production of representatives of rural grassroots women's representative meetings, in addition to being produced by region, women who have participated in mutual aid organizations should produce representatives by production organization in order to meet the needs of mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production.

Seventh, on working methods:

Since women's work permeates all aspects, women's work is relatively complex, extensive and diverse.

Therefore, the Women's Federation must understand the situation in many aspects, consult with relevant parties and cooperate according to conditions and possible division of labor when carrying out work. We must also insist on publicizing and re-publicizing to relevant parties, suggesting and re-suggesting, urging and re-urging, and we must establish regular contacts with relevant parties in the organization, exchange situations and opinions with each other, and participate in necessary work meetings with each other. Only in this way can women's work be done well.

Finally, the most important thing is to be good at actively seeking the specific leadership of the Party Committee at the same level, be good at cultivating and using cadres, be good at contacting the masses, relying on the masses, absorbing the experience created by the masses, and constantly improving and advancing their work.

    关于当前妇女工作问题的报告
    （在全国妇女工作会议上的报告并经一九五二年十二月十日全国妇联第四次执行委员会通过）
    中华全国民主妇女联合会秘书长　章蕴
    （一）全国妇女工作的估计
    自一九五○年秋全国妇联第三次执委扩大会议以来，由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，各有关方面的配合协助，全体妇女干部的积极努力，全国妇女工作有了很大的开展和进步。广大农村已广泛地建立了妇女基层组织，城市家庭妇女和工属绝大多数组织起来了。广大妇女群众，和男子肩并肩地积极参加了土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”、增产节约、思想改造等一系列的伟大的群众运动，发挥了巨大的作用，并在运动中锻炼了妇女自己。同时，结合着这一系列的运动，在社会上广泛进行了男女平等的教育与反对重男轻女的封建残余思想习俗的斗争，开展了妇女群众的文化学习工作，因而，无论城市或农村，新区或老区，妇女的政治、思想、文化水平都大大提高了，妇女无论在家庭或社会的地位，都有了较显著的变化。
    但是，在全国范围内，妇女工作的发展还是不平衡的，许多地方的基层组织还很不健全或流于形式，也还有少数地区尚未建立组织，妇婴卫生和儿童保育工作还远远赶不上妇女参加生产和学习的需要，妇女工作前进道路上还遭遇着相当大的残存的旧意识的梗阻和顽抗，妇女群众的自我教育和自我改造工作还作得不够深和不够广，妇女团体应有的维护妇女权利的作用还发挥得不够有力，对协助政府贯彻男女平等政策使之深入人心的工作也做得不够。因此，在广大妇女群众中还有大量的潜在力量未被发掘，未被吸引到国家建设中来，我们的任务还长远得很，艰巨得很，全国各级妇联组织和全国妇女还须作更大的努力，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，把妇女工作更向前推进一步。
    （二）关于当前新形势下妇女工作的新任务
    我们伟大的祖国已进入一个新的历史时期，毛主席所指示的三年准备工作已经完成了，即将在继续加强抗美援朝的同时，开始大规模的计划经济建设和文化建设。新中国的妇女是抗美援朝和建设祖国的一支不可缺少的队伍，而面向全体妇女的以女工、农妇及其他劳动妇女为主的民主妇联是这支队伍的骨干。因此，妇联在这个新时期新任务面前，除了继续加强抗美援朝工作直到最后胜利之外，必须更进一步发动和组织妇女积极参加工农业生产和文化学习，积极参加祖国建设的各项工作，从而积极地有步骤地解决妇女特殊的切身利益问题。这是当前妇女工作总的任务和方针。为了实现这一总的任务和方针，妇女工作的重点是：
    第一、发动广大妇女积极参加抗美援朝、祖国建设等各项中心工作，努力做出成绩，以提高妇女的自信，取得大家对妇女的信任，并以此来实际教育歧视妇女和不重视妇女工作的人们。
    第二、有计划地结合当前中心工作，加强妇女群众中的文化、政治教育和思想改造工作。因为几千年来重男轻女的社会在妇女群众中所造成的依赖心理、保守思想、自卑感和知识的贫乏，仍然严重地影响着她们的觉悟和前进。
    第三、进一步革除旧社会残存的束缚妇女的封建思想与习俗，如包办、买卖婚姻，打骂虐待妻子、儿媳的恶习及歧视妇女的观点等等，以扫除妇女参加工作和学习的客观障碍。
    第四、大力地、尽可能地协助卫生部门开展妇婴卫生和儿童保育工作，以适应国家经济建设与文化建设的需要，并为广大妇女创造走向生产、走向学习的条件。
    第五、加强妇联的组织，进一步发挥其作用，健全各级妇联的领导机构，加紧培养训练干部，以适应当前工作任务的需要。
    （三）对目前妇女工作中若干问题的意见：
    第一、关于城市妇女工作：
    （1）关于加强城市妇女工作的领导问题：自全国妇联宣教会议提出了妇女工作对象以工、农、小资产阶级劳动妇女（包括家庭劳动妇女）为主之后，对城市广大家庭劳动妇女的工作，乃引起了各地的重视，一年多来有了很大的开展和成绩，无论在工作内容、组织形式和工作方法上都解决了许多问题。为适应工作开展的需要，并鉴于城市妇女工作的复杂性，省以上的妇联应抽出干部建立专管城市工作的部门，以加强城市妇女工作的领导。
    （2）关于妇女劳动就业问题：大规模经济建设和文化建设将为妇女的劳动就业开辟广阔道路，但全面解决就业问题又必须是长期的。妇联应该一方面根据国家建设的需要，有计划地动员妇女参加到各种学习组织中去，提高她们的文化、政治、思想水平，培养工作技能，准备好就业的条件，输送她们到工作岗位上去；另方面可在国家生产、贸易、合作等有关机关的领导与支持下，根据不同的具体条件，在家庭手工业的基础上，组织城市妇女进行有销路的手工业生产。对于那些一时还不能走向社会劳动的家庭妇女，则号召她们搞好家务，带好孩子，帮助其家中参加社会劳动的成员，更好地搞好生产，搞好工作。这种家务劳动在今天还是需要的，直接间接对社会生产有利的。
    （3）关于工属工作问题：工属占城市人口中极大的比例，他们与爱国增产节约运动有着密切关系，经验证明：凡在工属中进行了团结教育，提高了他们的觉悟，并推动他们互助互济解决了一些日常的困难，做好了工属工作的地方，就能使工人安心生产，发挥生产积极性，提高劳动效能。因此，工属工作是城市妇女工作中重要的一部分。但过去在工属工作方面，妇联与工会有分工而合作不够，因而产生了工属工作与工会工作、生产任务脱节的现象。这有待于城市的妇联组织协同工会在实践中进一步取得经验以解决之。
    此外，为保证女工的健康和生产情绪，应特别注意教育女工家属，提高女工在家庭里的经济权利和地位，帮助女工家属成员间做到适当的分工，减去女工不必要的家务劳动，以免女工过度疲劳而影响生产。
    （4）关于女工工作问题：女工工作是工会工作的一部分，工会设有女工部专管女工工作。妇联的责任就在于协助、建议并督促工会加强女工工作，合理解决女工的特殊困难和福利问题。因此，妇联应该经常关切工会女工部门的建立、健全和工作情况，与女工部共同研究女工工作，并随时与工会协商，帮助工会在女工中进行一般工会工作所不及的妇女工作，解决女工的特殊问题。现在有些市妇联已经明确了上述工会、工会女工部和妇联在女工工作上的相互关系和一定的工作方法，因而获得了一定的成绩；但仍有许多市妇联还不善于这样做，今后应认真研究彻底解决这个问题。
    事实证明：女工的智慧和才能并不亚于男工，如找窍门，创造新的工作法，参加工会工作等等，在女工中都出现了许多极突出的事例。然而女工的进步和发展较男工更不平衡，还有不少女工保持着相当严重的轻视劳动和依赖男人的旧思想。妇联应向工会建议，把针对女工思想情况而加强女工思想教育的工作，做为工人教育的重要内容之一，在全体工人一般的活动中应注意吸收女工参加，并应在可能条件下多采用女工代表会议的形式加强女工工作。
    其次应协助工会，尽可能为女工解决婚姻不自由、家庭压迫、孩子拖累、怀孕、哺乳与妇女病等特殊问题。很多工厂，因为不重视解决女工中的特殊问题，以致严重地影响到女工的身体和精神的健康，女工缺勤率增长，反过来又大大地影响了生产。
    第二、关于农村生产运动中的妇女工作：
    （1）协助农民组织和农业生产领导机关，进一步发动妇女参加农业生产、互助合作，并帮助妇女克服生产中的和互助合作中的困难和问题，以增强爱国丰产运动的力量和推进互助合作运动。这是当前农村妇女工作中的首要工作。
    （2）各地妇联应针对当前几种地区妇女参加农业劳动的不同情况，密切结合生产，以逐步解决妇女的切身要求问题。第一、在妇女已大量参加农业劳动并有相当部分已参加了互助合作组织，但她们在家庭中、在互助合作组织中的经济民主权利与政治活动自由尚未充分解决或完全没有解决的地区，除在妇女中继续号召组织起来发展生产提高生产技术外，应着重在社会上开展男女平等的教育，响亮地提出男女同劳动同享受，并经过妇女自己的斗争，在生产运动中，解决妇女的经济民主权利问题，以此来推动生产运动。第二、在妇女过去一般不参加农业主要劳动而现已开始参加农业主要劳动并开始参加季节性的互助组织，但她们在互助组织和家庭中并无经济民主权利的地区，应当发动妇女尽可能参加农业主要劳动，并给以组织起来集体主义的前途教育，结合生产运动解决妇女民主平等的权利问题，同时在社会上进行男女平等的民主教育，以发动妇女潜在的劳动力，更进一步发展农业生产。第三、在妇女向来不参加或很少参加农业劳动的地区，主要是教育妇女参加农业劳动，争取平等权利，农业互助合作组织也应根据妇女的要求吸收她们参加，但不能操之过急。
    （3）应认真研究和适当解决当前互助合作组织中有关妇女劳动力的特殊问题：首先应努力争取实现男女同劳同酬，反对对妇女劳动不记分、少记分或男女同样记分而分值不等的轻视妇女的观点和不合理的办法。同时在互助合作组织中，男女应享有同等的民主权利，有相当数量妇女成员的互助合作组织，应在妇女成员中吸收劳动好又关心妇女群众的积极分子参加领导，参加组（社）的管理工作，以便密切联系妇女组（社）员，并适当解决她们的特殊要求。
    此外，随着妇女广泛地参加农业生产，就提出了农业劳动与家务劳动的矛盾问题。我们认为一方面应该有条件地、逐渐地、适当地解决这一矛盾，不应该把妇女完全束缚在家务劳动上，如举办简便的农忙托儿组织，以及将一天的劳动时间分成几节，并合理地按节定分，以便女社员参加农业劳动又能兼顾必要的家务劳动，或帮助女组（社）员在其家属成员中进行有计划的适当分工，以便女组（社）员能有时间参加农业生产等办法，都是可以推行的。另一方面，又必须在社会上展开教育，说明家务劳动是社会不可缺少的劳动，某些家庭手工劳动在目前条件下也是社会不可缺少的劳动，打破那种不承认家务劳动和家庭手工劳动的成果的错误观念，以及因而歧视妇女，不给妇女以政治经济民主平等权利的错误。对于孩子多、家务劳动重的妇女，则不应勉强要求她们过多的参加农业劳动。
    第三、关于少数民族地区的妇女工作：
    少数民族地区的妇女工作是与民族政策和宗教政策不可分开的，一般的妇女工作指示和决定不能完全适用于少数民族地区。今后各民族地区的妇联，应深入研究各该地区情况，提出具体方案，供当地党委及上级妇联研究。全国妇联及多民族地区的省市妇联应配备一定的专职干部加强研究少数民族中的妇女工作。
    第四、关于协助政府开展贯彻婚姻法运动的问题：
    妇联的任务之一就在于积极地为维护妇女权利，为实现男女平等，为清除重男轻女的封建残余思想恶习而斗争，故必须认真研究中共中央贯彻婚姻法的指示，根据指示的精神，结合各地不同的情况，协助党和人民政府展开全国规模的贯彻婚姻法的运动。在男女婚姻基本上得到了自由，自主婚姻已占绝大多数，民主和睦的新家庭和模范夫妇不断出现，打骂虐待妇女和因婚姻问题而死人的现象已属稀有的地区（基本上是老区和个别重点示范的新区），要严防自满，要深入检查，加以巩固，肃清封建婚姻制度的尾巴，建立全新的婚姻制度。在半自主婚姻占多数，自由婚姻较少，包办买卖婚姻、早婚、童养媳等风习也较少，打骂虐待妇女的现象仍然存在，因婚姻问题而死人的现象仍有发生的地区（部分老区和解放较早的新区），要大力宣传婚姻法，提倡自主婚姻，对半自主婚姻要承认其进步性但同时要指出其不足，并积极废除包办、买卖婚姻，反对虐待妇女的恶风习。在封建买卖包办婚姻还占绝大多数，婚姻自由被干涉，妇女自杀被杀案件不断发生的地区（绝大部分新区和老区的偏僻村庄），要大张旗鼓地宣传婚姻法，首先制止死人，反对虐待杀害妇女和干涉婚姻自由。
    各级妇联应成为党和人民政府在一九五三年三月开展贯彻婚姻法大运动的得力助手，为此，即应做好如下的准备工作：
    （1）必须首先在妇联系统的干部中认真细致地学习婚姻法，联系思想与工作，检查自己有无违犯婚姻法的行为，为运动月打下思想基础并准备好组织力量。
    （2）通过妇女代表会议在妇女群众中广泛地正确地宣传婚姻法及贯彻婚姻法运动的方针和政策。
    （3）应积极参加准备工作中的试点工作，并有计划地搜集有关婚姻案件的典型材料，加以研究。
    （4）应抽调得力干部参加当地人民政府统一的贯彻婚姻法运动委员会及其办公室的工作，并在总计划下发挥妇联整个组织的作用，完成应有的任务。
    （5）大力协助政府培养处理婚姻案件的司法干部和办理婚姻登记工作的干部，有计划地输送妇女干部到人民政府的司法部门工作。
    第五、妇婴卫生和儿童保育工作：
    各级妇联应尽可能地协助卫生部门开展妇婴卫生和儿童保育工作，以适应国家建设的需要。这一工作，各地虽都有了一些基础，但还存在着一些缺点，如对接生消毒法和育婴知识宣传的不够，妇联干部本身也未很好学习过，自然不能很好地向群众宣传；有些地方还把这一工作看作仅仅是业务部门的事，妇联很少过问。这是不能容许的。必须认识：妇婴卫生工作是件有关“保命”的大事，有直接保护生产力的作用。今后各级妇联的领导干部和一般干部，特别是基层干部，人人都应懂得妇婴卫生的基本常识，成为妇婴卫生工作的宣传者和协助卫生部门切实指导和检查妇婴卫生工作的助手。各级妇联应有计划地大批训练接产人员和改造训练旧产婆，已经训练过的人员，应抓紧组织领导，加强思想教育工作并协同卫生部门给以业务上的指导，以免自流。各级妇联要与卫生部门协商订出适合目前条件的妇婴卫生工作计划并保证切实执行；建议卫生部门与妇联密切合作，使妇婴卫生业务更好地和群众要求、群众运动相结合。
    在儿童保育工作方面，应继续贯彻一九五一年全国妇联妇女儿童福利工作会议决定的为广大劳动妇女及其子女服务的方针。主要是依靠群众自己的力量大量发展适合群众要求的、适合各种不同条件的、多种多样、大小不等、标准不一的群众性的简便的托儿所托儿站，正规的托儿所则应量力举办，不应机械要求高级形式和正规化。按照实际需要有计划地培养保育人员，普遍宣传育儿常识，这是当前儿童保育工作的基本要求。
    第六、关于组织问题：
    为了适应新的情况，作好上述工作，妇联必须从以下三方面加强组织与领导：
    （1）健全各级妇联领导机构。除配齐干部，尽可能做到满员满额外，各级妇联应调配一定的核心与骨干，健全工作制度，加强工作上的组织性、计划性。
    （2）加强培养干部与提高干部的质量，从全国妇联到各级妇联应在中央和当地党委的统一计划领导下，规定学习制度，进行经常的有系统的学习，决心学好。并应有计划地轮训各级干部，除与有关方面协商在训练干部的计划中适当规定妇女名额与必要的妇女工作内容外，县级妇联可组织妇女工作会议，作为辅助的训练方法，训练基层干部。区以上的妇女干部，由省、大行政区与全国妇联有计划地分工轮训。
    （3）加强和整理基层组织，基层代表会应有定期的必要的次数不多的会议制度，委员会应经常联系代表，指导代表进行工作。
    农村基层妇女代表会代表的产生，除按地域分片产生外，凡已参加到互助组织中的妇女，应以生产组织为单位来产生代表，以适应发动妇女参加农业生产的需要。
    第七、关于工作方法问题：
    由于妇女工作渗透在各方面，因此妇女工作就比较复杂、广泛而具有多样性。
    因此，妇联在进行工作时，必须了解多方面的情况，必须与有关方面共同商量并按条件与可能分工合作。也必须坚持向有关方面宣传再宣传，建议再建议，督促再督促的方法，必须与有关方面在组织上建立经常联系，互相交换情况和意见，互相参加必要的工作会议。这样才能把妇女工作搞好。
    最后，最重要的是要善于主动求得同级党委的具体领导，善于培养和使用干部，善于联系群众，依靠群众，吸取群众创造的经验，把自己的工作不断提高，推向前进。
