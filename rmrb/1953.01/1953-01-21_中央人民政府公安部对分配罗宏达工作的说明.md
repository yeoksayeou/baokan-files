    Explanation by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government Regarding the Assignment of Luo Hongda's Work
    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on December 17, 1952, pointed out the issue of our ministry's reasonable assignment of Comrade Luo Hongda's work. We hereby provide the following explanation regarding our past assignment of Comrade Luo Hongda's work:
    Luo Hongda is a graduate of the Mining Department of Tianjin Beiyang University. In 1950, he was assigned to work in our ministry by the Central Personnel Department. In August 1951, he was transferred to study at the Central Public Security School. After graduating at the end of October 1952, he was still assigned back to the ministry to do public security work in factories and mines. At that time, because Luo had thoughts of transferring to another profession and was unwilling to accept the organization's assignment, we had five conversations with him within this period of less than two months, persuading and mobilizing him to settle down to work. This proves that Luo's claim in his letter that he was waiting for work assignment at the school for more than four months is inconsistent with the facts. Luo Hongda also stated in his letter, "In order to strengthen basic construction work, technical cadres in production departments must be transferred to basic construction departments, and technical cadres in non-production departments should be transferred to basic construction departments more quickly." This is generally correct, but we are precisely assigning him to do public security work in factories and mines in order to meet the needs of the national economic construction tasks; however, he has consistently failed to reach an agreement with our understanding. We should point out that in order to protect the smooth progress of national economic construction, we also need talents who understand production technology to do public security work, and it is by no means, as Luo Hongda claimed, "to reserve cadres." We are not keeping him in the public security department simply for the sake of using technical cadres' "culture." As for our work assignment for Comrade Luo Hongda, the delay has been relatively long because his personal opinions have not been consistent with the organization's, which is worthy of our attention and overcoming in future work. Regarding the issue of Comrade Luo Hongda's future work assignment, we must reconsider it; and finally solicit his own opinions. If he is still unwilling to stay in our ministry to work, and with the consent of the Central Personnel Department, we will introduce him to the Central Personnel Department for another work assignment.  Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government

### 中央人民政府公安部对分配罗宏达工作的说明

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央人民政府公安部对分配罗宏达工作的说明
    编辑同志：一九五二年十二月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏指出我部应合理分配罗宏达同志工作的问题。特将我们过去分配罗宏达同志工作的经过说明如下：
    罗宏达系天津北洋大学采矿系毕业的学生。一九五○年经中央人事部分配我部工作，一九五一年八月间调中央公安学校学习，一九五二年十月底毕业后，仍分配回部做厂矿部门公安工作。当时由于罗存有转业思想，不肯接受组织上的分配，在此不足两个月的期间内，我们曾向他进行了五次谈话，说服动员劝他安心工作。由此证明，罗所反映在校等待分配工作四个多月的情况是不符合事实的。罗宏达在信中还提出“为了加强基本建设工作，生产部门的技术干部都必须抽调到基本建设部门中去，非生产部门的技术干部，就更应该迅速抽调到基本建设部门去。”这自然一般是对的，但是我们也正是本着为适应国家经济建设任务的需要，而分配他去厂矿部门作公安工作；而他却始终未能和我们的认识取得一致。我们应当指出，为了保卫国家经济建设的顺利进行，我们也正需要懂得生产技术的人才作公安工作，而绝不是罗宏达所谈“为了储备干部”，我们更不是为了单纯的使用技术干部的“文化”将他留在公安部门。至于我们对罗宏达同志的工作分配，因他个人与组织上的意见未取得一致，致拖延的时间较久，是值得我们在今后工作中注意克服的。关于罗宏达同志今后工作分配问题，我们须再重作考虑；并最后征求他本人意见，如他仍不愿留本部工作，而又在中央人事部的同意之下，我们即介绍他到中央人事部另行分配工作。  中央人民政府公安部
