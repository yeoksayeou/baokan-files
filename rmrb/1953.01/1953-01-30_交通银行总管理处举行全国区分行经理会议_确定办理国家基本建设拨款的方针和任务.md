    Communications Bank Head Office Holds National Branch Manager Meeting
    Determines Guidelines and Tasks for Handling National Capital Construction Appropriations

    The Head Office of the Communications Bank convened its Fourth National District and Branch Manager Meeting in Beijing at the end of last year. This meeting was held to continue accepting the government's entrustment, handling the supervision and appropriation of national capital construction funds, and determining the work guidelines and tasks for 1953. A total of 136 people attended the meeting, including managers of district banks and provincial and municipal branch banks in major administrative regions, as well as heads of planning, appropriation, and accounting departments of district and branch banks; 28 representatives from relevant central departments attended as observers.

    Based on the fiscal and economic situation of the nation entering a large-scale economic construction phase in 1953, the meeting determined that the working guideline for the Communications Bank in handling the national capital construction appropriation business in 1953 is: to promptly supply capital construction funds, supervise the rational use of funds, strengthen key management, conduct in-depth on-site inspections, improve appropriation methods, and strengthen the organizational structure of Communications Banks at all levels, so as to improve the basic construction appropriation and supervision work on the basis of past work.

    The meeting believed that timely supply of basic construction funds and supervision of their rational use are important conditions for ensuring the smooth completion of basic construction work. Therefore, the Communications Bank must not only ensure the timely supply of funds but also effectively supervise the rational use of funds. The meeting criticized the one-sided view of only emphasizing the timely supply of funds while abandoning the supervision of the rational use of funds, because only emphasizing the timely supply of funds without supervising the rational use of funds will inevitably lead to the accumulation and waste of funds, preventing national investment from exerting its maximum effectiveness. The meeting determined that the Communications Bank's supply of funds must adhere to the principles of timeliness, accuracy, and legality, and strictly prevent work stoppages and material shortages caused by delays in work and mechanical appropriation methods. However, at the same time, the Communications Bank must adopt a combination of pre-inspection and post-supervision methods for the construction funds allocated by the state. This is to promote the implementation of economic accounting systems by basic construction units through inspection and supervision, thereby saving national funds and ensuring the smooth completion of basic construction.

    At the same time, the meeting also pointed out that the Communications Bank's basic construction appropriation business in 1953 is heavy. In addition to handling fund allocation and supervision of use, it is necessary to manage the working capital of basic construction, supervise basic construction units or competent enterprise departments to offset basic construction expenditures with their own basic depreciation funds and profits according to plan, implement monetary management of contracting enterprises, and help basic construction units to carefully calculate and reduce project costs in the process of supervising the use of funds, thereby implementing comprehensive financial supervision of basic construction. In order to smoothly complete this arduous task, according to the focus of the national economic construction in 1953, it was decided to strengthen key management. It is required that all levels of banks establish independent appropriation agencies for the management of key units, organize strong forces, and be personally controlled by the leading personnel of each level of banks. It is necessary to conduct in-depth on-site inspections, and promptly study and solve the problems therein. For general construction units, in principle, only appropriations are handled, and spot checks are carried out if strength permits.

    The meeting also studied the Communications Bank's current appropriation methods, systems and procedures, as well as cadre and organizational issues.

    交通银行总管理处举行全国区分行经理会议
    确定办理国家基本建设拨款的方针和任务
    交通银行总管理处于去年年底在北京召开了第四次全国区行、分行经理会议。此次会议是为了继续接受政府的委托，办理国家基本建设资金的监督拨款业务，确定一九五三年的工作方针与任务。参加这次会议的有各大行政区区行及省市分行的经理和区行、分行的计划、拨款、会计等部门的负责人共一百三十六人；中央各有关部门列席代表二十八人。
    会议根据一九五三年国家转入大规模经济建设的财政经济情况，确定一九五三年交通银行在办理国家基本建设拨款业务的工作方针是：及时供应基本建设资金，监督资金的合理使用，加强重点管理，深入现场检查，改进拨款方法，并加强各级交通银行的组织机构，使得基本建设拨款与监督工作，在过去的工作基础上提高一步。
    会议认为：及时供应基本建设资金并监督其合理使用，是保证基本建设工作顺利完成的重要条件之一，因此，交通银行一方面要做到及时供应资金，另一方面又要很好的监督资金的合理使用。会议对于只强调及时供应资金，而放弃监督资金合理使用的片面观点，作了批判，因为只强调及时供应资金而不监督资金的合理使用，必然会发生资金的积压浪费现象，使国家投资不能发挥最大的效能。会议确定：交通银行供应资金必须遵守及时、正确、合法的原则，要严格防止因工作上的延缓和拨款方法上的机械所发生的停工待料现象。但同时，交通银行对于国家拨出的建设资金，又必须采取事前检查与事后监督相结合的办法。以便通过检查与监督促使基本建设单位实行经济核算制，从而节约国家资金，保证基本建设的顺利完成。
    同时会议也指出：交通银行一九五三年的基本建设拨款业务是繁重的，除办理资金拨付与监督使用外，要管理基本建设的流动资金，要督促基本建设单位或企业主管部门按照计划，以其本身的基本折旧基金和利润抵拨基本建设支出，要对包工企业实施货币管理，要在监督资金使用的过程中帮助基本建设单位精打细算降低工程成本等等，从而对基本建设实施全面的财务监督。为了顺利完成这一繁重的任务，根据一九五三年国家经济建设的重点，确定加强重点管理。要求各级行对重点单位的管理，须设立独立的拨款机构，组织坚强的力量，并由各级行领导人员亲自掌握。做到深入现场检查，及时研究和解决其中的问题。对一般建设单位，原则上只办理拨款，如力量许可则进行抽查。
    会议并对交通银行现行的拨款办法、制度和手续及干部、机构问题也进行了研究。
