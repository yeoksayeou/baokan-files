New People, New Deeds

    A Cart Stuck in the Mud Pit

    Editor's Note: This "New People, New Deeds" article was forwarded by the Cultural Education Office of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The author of this article, Comrade Bao Wenjie, was illiterate in the past. He recently graduated from an accelerated literacy training class and began studying elementary Chinese courses. This article describes an event he personally experienced.

    On August 29th last year, our transportation platoon's cart went to Jingyang County, Shaanxi, to pick up medicine boxes. On the way back, it was raining heavily, and the comrades were drenched. The path was full of slippery mud, and people would slip if they weren't careful. The mules were pulling the cart as slowly as ants. Just when the situation was worrying, suddenly, with a "glug," the cart fell into a big mud pit!

    What to do now? Everyone looked at each other, standing blankly beside the cart. The leading comrade immediately said, "Comrades! We must be responsible for the revolutionary work and must not allow the people's property to be damaged. We must pull the cart out immediately." Before he finished speaking, everyone jumped into the mud pit without hesitation, some carrying, some lifting. But the more they lifted, the deeper the cart sank. Everyone was so anxious that sparks seemed to fly from their eyes.

    Just then, eight villagers passed by—they were going home from the market. When they saw the situation, they jumped into the mud pit together, without even bothering to roll up their trousers, to help us pull the cart out. In the mud pit, it was impossible to exert strength, and the cart still couldn't be pulled out. Just as everyone was getting anxious, one of the old men came up with an idea: they needed to find an ox to help pull from above. He thought for a moment and said, "My ox is at home, I'll go get it." With that, he ran back in two or three strides, panting as he brought the ox. He personally helped us harness the ox, picked up the whip, stood on the cart, and loudly urged the ox on. At this tense moment, unfortunately, our mule kicked his leg. He was kicked to the ground, in so much pain that he couldn't speak. But, he immediately bit his lip, got up despite the pain, and insisted on driving the ox. The ox pulled forward, and with everyone's effort, they finally pulled the cart up. At this time, the rain lessened. We thanked the villagers and, after finding out that the old man who had been kicked by the mule was named Zhang Youcai and lived in Daguo Village, we drove the cart, treading on the mud, back. After walking more than half a kilometer, I looked back and saw that old man Zhang Youcai, although constantly stroking his leg in pain, was still standing on the road watching worriedly to see if the cart was going well.

    The cart arrived home when it was already dusk. I didn't change my clothes and reported the matter to the leading comrade. After listening, the leading comrade immediately sent Director Bai from the hygiene team and me on horseback straight to Daguo Village. When we arrived at the gate of old man Zhang Youcai's house, the horse was panting and covered in sweat. I explained our purpose, and the old man was so moved that he sat blankly on the kang (earthen bed) for a while before taking a breath and saying, "Comrade! Are you tired from the journey?" Director Bai bent down and carefully examined the old man's injury—it turned out that the thigh bone had been kicked, and the leg was already swollen brightly—and quickly applied medicine to him. At this time, the villagers who had rushed to see him after hearing the news were already crowded around like a small mountain.

    Why Was She Sitting in the Cold Wind?

    One afternoon last December, the train brought us to Zhuangli Town, Shaanxi. Outside the train station was a vast field. The weather was very cold, and the wind stung our faces. Suddenly, I heard the sound of a child crying somewhere. Looking closely, I saw a woman holding a child sitting on a stone to the left of the path in front of us. I felt strange in my heart: "Why is she sitting on this stone holding a child in such a strong wind?"

    The wind was too much for the child, and the child cried again. The woman quickly fed the child milk and gently patted the child with her hand. At this time, a young student-like person could be seen walking towards us from a distant height, looking for something on the ground with his head down. Soon, that person came up to us and asked anxiously, "Comrades, have you seen a paper package?" This stunned us. The person quickly explained:

    "When I was walking along this road just now, I rested somewhere
    and forgot to take a paper package I had placed on the ground." Just then, the woman picked up a paper package and asked the person directly:

    "Is this the paper package? You first tell me what's inside?" The person looked and immediately said with a smile, "Auntie, this is exactly the paper package. Inside there are two million yuan and a letter written to Xu Feng of Northwest University. Xu Feng is me."

    When the woman saw that he had said everything correctly, she returned the paper package to him. The person took the paper package, reached into his pocket, took out 200,000 yuan, and wanted to give it to the child to buy candy. The woman said seriously, "Put the money away! If I wanted money, I wouldn't have been sitting in the cold wind for so long. I am a new woman led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!..." She looked at me and said, "Comrade, do you think so?"

    陷在泥坑里的大车
    编者按：这篇“新人新事”是中国人民解放军某部的文化教育办公室转来的。本文作者包文杰同志过去是个文盲，最近刚从速成识字训练班毕业，开始学习初小语文课程。本文所写的是他亲身经历的一件事。
    去年八月二十九日那天，咱们运输排的大车到陕西泾阳县去拉药箱。回来的途中，天哗哗下着大雨，同志们浑身打得水淋淋的。小路上满是稀泥，人一不小心就会滑倒。骡子拉着大车走得就像蚂蚁那样慢。情况正使人发愁，忽然咕噜一下，车跌进一个大泥坑里啦！
    这一下怎么办呢？大家你看我，我看你，直楞楞地站在车旁。领导同志马上说：“同志们！我们要对革命工作负责，决不能使人民财产受损失。我们要把车马上拉出来。”他的话还没说完，大伙都奋不顾身地跳进泥坑，有的扛，有的掀。可是大车越掀越深了。大家急得眼里飞出了火花。
    正在这时，过来了八个老乡——是赶集回家去的。他们看见这个情况，连裤子都顾不得挽，也一齐跳进泥坑里，帮咱们向外拉车。泥坑里，有力使不上，大车还是拉不出来。大伙正焦急，其中一位老大爷出了个主意：要找头牛在上面帮着拉才行。他想了想，说：“我的牛在家，我去牵。”说着，他就三步并做两步跑回去，气喘喘地把牛牵来了。他又亲自帮咱套好牛，拿起鞭子，站在车上高声吆喝赶牛。正在紧张关头，不幸，咱们的骡子一脚踢中了他的腿。他被踢得倒在地上，疼得连话也说不出来。但是，他立刻紧咬着嘴唇，不顾疼痛地爬了起来，坚持来赶牛。牛向前拉，大伙儿再一使劲，到底把车拉了上来。这时候，雨小了。我们向老乡们道了谢，问清了这位被骡子踢伤的老大爷名叫张有才，住在大锅村。我们就赶着大车，踩着稀泥回去。走了一里多路，我回头一看，那张有才老大爷，虽然痛的不断抚着腿，但他还站在路上关心地看大车是否好走。
    大车到了家，已经是黄昏时候了。我没换衣服，就把这件事向领导同志报告。领导同志听了立刻让卫生队白主任和我两人骑马直奔大锅村。到了张有才老大爷家门口，马喘着热气，浑身是汗。我说明了来意，老大爷感动得呆呆的坐在炕上，好一会才舒了口气说：“同志！走乏了没有。”白主任弯下腰，仔细地检查着老大爷的伤势——原来大腿骨被踢中了，腿上已肿得明亮亮的——赶快给他擦上药。这时，听到这个消息赶来看的老乡已经围成像座小山似的。

    她为什么坐在冷风地里？
    去年十二月的一个下午，火车把我们送到了陕西庄里镇。出了火车站，前面就是广阔的田野。天气很冷，风刮得脸上发痛。忽然，我听见什么地方有小孩子的啼哭声。仔细一看，原来在我们前面那条小路左边的一块石头上，坐着一个抱着小孩的妇女。我心里觉得奇怪：“这么大的风，她为什么抱着孩子坐在这石头上呢？”
    风刮得孩子受不了，孩子又哭起来了。那个妇女赶紧喂孩子奶，并用手轻轻地拍着孩子。这时候，远远的高地上有一个青年学生似的人向着我们走来，他低着头在地上找什么东西。很快，那个人就走到我们跟前，着急地问：“同志，你们看见一个纸包包吗？”这把我们问呆了。那人连忙解释说：
    “我刚才从这条路上走过的时候，在什么地方歇了
    一歇，把一个纸包放在地上忘记拿走了。”正在这时，那个妇女就提着一个纸包，直截了当地问那个人：
    “是不是这个纸包包？你先说说里面放着些什么？”那人一看，马上笑着说：“大嫂，正是这个纸包。里面有二百万元钱，还有一封信，是写给西北大学徐峰的。徐峰就是我。”
    那妇女见他说得都对，便把纸包包还给了他。那人接过纸包，伸手从口袋里掏出二十万元，要送给孩子买糖果吃。那妇女认真地说：“钱你收起来吧！我如果要钱，就不会在冷风地里坐这么久。我是毛主席、共产党领导下的新妇女呀！……”她看了看我，说：“同志，你说是不是？”  皮建章（附图片）
