Soviet Newspaper Experience

Eight, "Excellent Quality Work Team Correspondence Column"

The Soviet people's struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is inseparable from their constant concern for improving product quality.

Soviet local newspapers, in accordance with the Party's resolutions, tirelessly fight for the production of high-quality products.

The "Ural Worker" newspaper has provided great assistance to the Party organization of Sverdlovsk Oblast in this noble cause.

The newspaper wrote: "One evening, in the youth workers' dormitory of the Serovsk Metallurgical Factory, a lively and interesting debate unfolded. They debated how young people should handle clothing. One person even suggested that the issue be brought up at the Communist Youth League meeting.

"At first glance, this issue may not seem important, but it once again points to the tremendous cultural upsurge of Soviet workers. Their various demands are growing.

"Soviet people oppose luxurious and extravagant fashion, but they are willing to wear suitable, beautiful, and well-tailored clothes. Soviet people demand and have the right to demand comfortable, elegant, and exquisitely made furniture. They oppose crude wardrobes or chairs."

The above passage is excerpted from an editorial titled "Excellent Quality Work Team" published in the "Ural Worker" newspaper. The struggle for product quality and the honor of factory trademarks occupies a significant place in the newspaper. The editorial department widely publicized the initiative of Alexander Chutkikh and reported on the effective work of his followers in the Ural region.

The newspaper wrote: "Alexander Chutkikh's initiative has special significance for the enterprises in our oblast. In their New Year's greetings to Comrade Stalin, the workers of our oblast pointed out that the quality of products in many enterprises is still low, and there is a large amount of waste due to defective products. We swear to our leader that we will improve quality indicators and gloriously complete this task in a Bolshevik manner.

"The Ural people are famous for having many skilled workers and technicians. This means that they have good conditions for competing for the glorious title of excellent quality work team in the competition to produce first-class products."

The newspaper is constantly making various efforts to ensure that the products produced in the enterprises of Sverdlovsk Oblast achieve outstanding and excellent quality.

The workers of the Red Ural Copper Smelter, in a letter published in the "Ural Worker" newspaper, proposed a suggestion - to organize an excellent quality work team correspondence column in the newspaper. They pointed out that it is now time to widely promote the experience of excellent quality work teams. It should be understood that it often happens that a new method of one work team in the same enterprise is unknown to other departments. The exchange of excellent work experience among various enterprises is also not well organized. Organizing correspondence from excellent quality work teams in the newspaper will make the competition of excellent quality workers more effective and can quickly disseminate good experiences.

The editorial department approved this suggestion and called on the followers of Alexander Chutkikh to report on the experience of producing first-class products. Excellent quality workers Shubanov, Zhudov, Klyuchkov, and others participated in this reporting. Comrades enthusiastically reported their achievements and put forward valuable suggestions.

After that, Kuznetsov, a worker at the Sverdlov Mechanical Manufacturing Factory, further proposed a meaningful suggestion - to organize excellent quality schools in enterprises through newspapers.

He wrote: "Many excellent quality workers have appeared in the 'Ural Worker' newspaper. Obviously, everyone has accumulated their own experience. I think it is now time to pass on business experience to comrades, so as to transform an excellent quality worker and an excellent quality work team into an excellent quality factory and workshop, and even transform everyone participating in production into an excellent quality worker. We should use the experience gained in the struggle to improve labor productivity and establish a high-level new type of Stakhanov school - an excellent quality school."

Kuznetsov's suggestion was warmly approved again. Comrade Boberyov, captain of the axle work team of the wheel workshop of the Ural Railway Car Manufacturing Factory, and Comrade Zhutaikin, captain of the casting work team of the foundry workshop, and other Stakhanov workers in the factory directly imparted the experience of excellent quality work to other workers in their workplaces.

Shumenov, an excellent lathe worker at the Ivanov Mikhailovich Factory, conducted the course of the Excellent Quality Stakhanov School directly at the workplace of female lathe worker Yulavleva. Within the specified time, he gathered young and new lathe workers next to his lathe. Comrade Moksunov, a nail-making worker at the Luginsk Metallurgical Factory, followed the example of Comrade Kuznetsov and, with the help of technicians, established an excellent quality school in his workshop. He instructed other nail makers in various working methods on his lathe, teaching them how to work to produce first-class products.

The "Ural Worker" newspaper carried out tremendous mass work around the competition for producing high-quality products. With the help of the inspection teams and worker correspondents in various enterprises, the newspaper sharply criticized those who produced substandard products and some leaders who did not take effective measures to improve quality.

The materials of the inspection team published in the newspaper wrote: "Metallurgists from the New Tagansk Factory are frequent guests of the Gogel and Lebazhinsk mines. They come to the mine with the requirement to improve the quality of ore and limestone.

"The leading staff of the mine receive them kindly and warmly, but they often give the following answer to their requirements: 'Nature cannot be changed...'. That is to say: 'There are many raw materials, but the quality cannot be blamed. It is impossible to make better things now, because this is determined by the raw materials.'"

However, as the inspection team pointed out, the matter is not entirely determined by "nature", but because the level of production technology here is very low. (End of full text)

    苏联地方报纸在进行工业报道中联系实际联系群众的一些经验
    鲍碇  江虹
    八、“优良质量工作队通讯栏”
    苏联人民为提早完成五年计划而斗争，是和经常关心生产品质量的改进分不开的。
    苏联地方报纸根据党的决议，不倦地为生产优等质量的产品而斗争。
    “乌拉尔工人”报在这个高尚的事业里，对斯维尔德洛夫斯克州的党组织作了巨大的帮助。
    报上写道：“某晚，在西洛夫斯克冶金工厂的青年工人宿舍里，热烈地展开了有趣的争论，他们争论着关于年青人应该怎样处理穿着问题。甚至有一个人主张把这个问题提到共产主义青年团的会议上去讨论。
    “开始看起来，似乎这个问题并不重要，然而这个问题又一次指出了苏维埃工人巨大的文化高涨。他们的各种要求正在日益增长着。
    “苏维埃人反对那种豪华的、奢侈的时髦，但是他们愿意穿着合适的、美丽的、缝裁得很好的服装。苏维埃人要求而且有权利要求舒适的、优美的、制造得很雅致的家具，他们反对粗野的衣柜或椅子。”
    以上这一段话是从发表在“乌拉尔工人”报上的一篇题为“优良质量工作队”的社论里摘录来的。为产品的质量而斗争，为争取工厂商标的荣誉，在报上占着不少的地位。编辑部广泛地宣传了亚历山大、丘脱基赫的倡议，而且报道了他的乌拉尔地区的响应者的有效的工作。
    报纸写道：“亚历山大·丘脱基赫的倡议，对于我州的企业有着特殊的意义。我州的劳动者给斯大林同志的贺年信中，指出许多企业的产品的质量至今仍是低的，并且存在很大的出产废品的损耗现象。我们向领袖宣誓，我们要改善质量的指标，并且要按照布尔什维克的方式光荣地去完成这个任务。
    “乌拉尔人是因为有许多熟练工人和技师而出名的。这就是说他们有良好的条件在竞赛中争取生产头等产品的优良质量工作队的光荣称号。”
    报纸为使斯维尔德洛夫斯克州企业中的生产品获得出类拔萃的优良质量，不断地作种种的努力。
    红色乌拉尔炼铜工人们发表在“乌拉尔工人”报上的信中，提出了一个建议——在报上组织优良质量工作队通讯栏。他们指出：现在已经到了广泛推广优良质量工作队工作经验的时候了。应该了解事情往往是这样的，在同一企业里一个工作队的新方法，其他部门就不知道。各个企业优良工作经验的交流，也有被组织得不好的。在报纸上组织优良质量工作队的通讯，使优良质量工作者的竞赛更加有效，并能迅速传布好的经验。
    编辑部赞成这个建议，并号召亚历山大·丘脱基赫的响应者报道生产头等产品的经验。优良质量工作者舒巴诺夫、朱多夫、克吕契可夫等纷纷参加了这个报道。同志们热情地报道了自己的成就，提出了有价值的建议。
    之后，斯维尔德洛夫机械制造工厂工人库兹聂佐夫进一步提出了一个有意义的建议——通过报纸在企业里组织优良质量学校。
    他写道：“在‘乌拉尔工人’报上，出现了许多优良质量的工作者。显然每个人都积累了自己的经验。我认为现在是向同志们传达业务经验的时候了，务使把一个优良质量工作者和优良质量工作队，变成一个优良质量工厂、车间，以至把一切参加生产的人都变成优良质量工作者。应该利用在提高劳动生产率的斗争中所得到的经验，建立高级的新型的斯塔哈诺夫学校——优良质量学校。”
    库兹聂佐夫的建议又获得热烈的赞同。乌拉尔火车厢制造工厂车轮车间轴杆工作队队长鲍贝里夫同志和熔铸车间铸型工作队队长朱泰金同志以及工厂里的其他斯塔哈诺夫工作者，在工作岗位上直接地向其他工人传授优良质量工作的经验。
    依凡诺夫·米哈洛维支工厂的优秀镟床工人雪门诺夫，在女镟床工人尤拉芙列娃的工作场所，直接地进行了优良质量斯塔哈诺夫学校的课业，在规定的时间内，在他的车床旁边集合了年青的新的镟床工人们。李乌金斯克冶金工厂洋钉制造工人莫克苏诺夫同志按照了库兹聂佐夫同志的范例，在技师的帮助下，在自己的车间里建立了优良质量学校。他在车床旁边实地向其他制钉工人指示各种工作方法，教导他们要怎样工作才能产生头等的产品。
    “乌拉尔工人”报围绕着生产优良质量产品的竞赛问题，进行了巨大的群众工作。报纸在各企业的检查组和工人通讯员的帮助下，对那些生产不合规格的现象和一部分对改善质量不采取有效方法的领导人，进行了尖锐的批评。
    发表在报上的检查组的材料写道：“新塔干斯克工厂的冶金学者，是高哥尔斯克和莱巴静斯克矿山经常的客人。他们抱着改善矿石和石灰石质量的要求来到这个矿山。
    “矿山里的领导工作人员亲切地、热情地接待他们，但对于他们的要求却常常给予这样的回答：‘不能改变自然……’。这就是说：‘原料是很多的，但不能责备质量的好坏，现在不可能制造更好的东西，因为这是被原始材料所决定了的。’”
    但是，正如检查组所提出的，事情完全不是决定于“自然”，而是因为在这里生产技术水平非常低的缘故。（全文完）
