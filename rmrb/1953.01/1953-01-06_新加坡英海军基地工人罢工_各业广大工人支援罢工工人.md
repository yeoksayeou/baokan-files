Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Singapore News: 10,000 workers at the British Naval Base in Singapore went on strike on December 29, 1952, demanding increased wages and cost of living allowances. Almost all Asian workers employed by British naval institutions in Singapore participated in the strike. British naval authorities have long ignored the workers' reasonable demands.

This strike has paralyzed the largest British naval base in the Far East. A spokesperson for the British naval authorities in Singapore admitted that the strike has prevented the 20,300-ton British aircraft carrier "Unicorn," which was originally scheduled to sail to Korea to participate in the war of aggression, and several small warships from departing, and will significantly delay the repair work of British ships.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: Singapore News: The large-scale strike of 10,000 workers at the British Naval Base in Singapore, which began on December 29, 1952, has received support from workers in various industries in Singapore. As of the 3rd, 121 labor organizations in Singapore had decided to donate more than 100,000 Malayan dollars to support the striking workers fighting for increased wages and cost of living allowances. The British Army Employees Union distributed leaflets on the 3rd, calling on members to contribute to the striking workers' fund. Meanwhile, other unions in Singapore have held rallies to express their support for the striking workers. Dozens of hospital staff in the British naval department in Singapore have also gone on strike.

Due to the desperate colonial war waged by British imperialism in Malaya for the past four and a half years and the "embargo" policy of following the US government, the economic situation in Malaya has deteriorated. Inflation and rising cost of living have made the lives of the working class increasingly impoverished. The large-scale strike of British naval base workers and the support of Singaporean workers for the striking workers show that the broad masses of workers in Malaya are actively fighting against the evils caused by the war policy and defending their own interests.

    新加坡英海军基地工人罢工
    各业广大工人支援罢工工人
    【新华社二日讯】新加坡消息：新加坡英国海军基地的工人一万名从一九五二年十二月二十九日起举行要求增加工资和生活津贴的罢工。在新加坡英国海军机构里工作的亚洲籍工人几乎全体都参加了罢工。英国海军当局对于工人们的这一合理要求，曾经长期置之不理。
    这次罢工使这一个英国在远东最大的海军基地陷于瘫痪。新加坡英国海军当局发言人承认：这次罢工使原定要开到朝鲜参加侵略战争的两万零三百吨的英国航空母舰“独角兽号”和几艘小军舰停在港内不能开行，并将大大地阻延英舰的修理工作。
    【新华社五日讯】新加坡消息：从一九五二年十二月二十九日开始的新加坡英国海军基地一万工人的大罢工，得到了新加坡各业广大工人的支援。截至三日为止，新加坡一百二十一个劳工组织已决定捐助马来亚币十万余元以支援为要求增加工资和生活费津贴而斗争的罢工工人。英国陆军雇员工会曾在三日散发传单，号召会员们资助罢工工人的基金。同时，新加坡其他工会也纷纷举行大会表示支持罢工工人。新加坡英国海军部门的医院工作人员数十人，也已实行罢工。
    由于四年半以来英帝国主义在马来亚进行的绝望的殖民战争和追随美国政府的“禁运”政策，马来亚经济情况日益恶化。通货膨胀和生活费不断上升，使工人阶级的生活日益贫困。这次英国海军基地工人的大罢工和新加坡工人对罢工工人的支援，表明马来亚广大工人正为反对战争政策所造成的恶果和保卫他们的切身利益而积极斗争。
