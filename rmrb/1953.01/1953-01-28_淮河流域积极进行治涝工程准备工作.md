Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, January 27th: The Huai River Commission and its subordinate Huai River leadership organs have completed the design work for this year's waterlogging control projects. At present, the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River are making active preparations, and waterlogging control projects throughout the entire basin will fully commence in March.

Waterlogging control projects are one of the key projects in the third year of Huai River management. The scope of this project is as follows: In areas with higher terrain in the upper reaches of the river, terraced fields and dikes will be built; in general areas, both drainage and water storage will be emphasized to create waterlogging control and irrigation projects; in low-lying areas, ditches will be dug, fields will be raised, and the area of cultivated land will be expanded. In this way, the third year of the Huai River management project will advance from point-and-line governance to area governance, so as to fundamentally eliminate disasters in the Huai River basin. The diversion projects of the Huai River's main stream and tributaries constructed in Wuhe County are continuing. A drainage canal more than 130 kilometers long, excavated to drain accumulated water from the area north of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, has now been basically completed. In addition, while the Huai River tributaries of the Bao River, Hei River, Gang River, Wo River, Yao River, and Quan River will be dredged, ditches will be universally excavated, and ponds and dikes will be built in the 2,400 square kilometer area along the North Fei River, in parts of the Su County Special District's Sui River basin, and in the area of approximately 5,000 square kilometers north of the Huai River, east of the Ying River, west of the Wo River, and south of Mengcheng. These farmland water conservancy projects will form a network of irrigation systems with the main stream of the Huai River and its tributaries, and will thoroughly eliminate waterlogging disasters.

In order to uniformly control waterlogging disasters throughout the entire basin, the Huai River Commission specifically convened a meeting on eliminating waterlogging in December of last year, and determined the policy for eliminating waterlogging disasters in the Huai River basin. Subsequently, the Henan Province Huai River Management Headquarters and the Henan Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau jointly formulated Henan Province's waterlogging control plan and actively carried out preparations before construction. For the large-scale North Fei River drainage and irrigation project in northern Anhui Province, the Huai River Commission dispatched five survey teams as early as last winter to conduct two months of surveying and exploration, and basically completed the design work. Now, the command post for leading the construction of this project has been established, and it is mobilizing laborers and transporting grain and fodder in preparation for starting work in March.

    淮河流域积极进行治涝工程准备工作
    【新华社蚌埠二十七日电】治淮委员会和所属各级治淮领导机关，已完成今年的治涝工程的各项设计工作。目前淮河上、中、下游都在作积极准备，全流域的治涝工程将在三月间全面开工。
    治涝工程是第三年度的治淮工程中的重点工程之一。这个工程的范围是：在河道上游地势较高的地区，要修梯田、筑塘堰；一般地区要排水和蓄水并重，作治涝和灌溉工程；低洼地区要挖沟抬田，扩大耕地面积。这样，第三年度治淮工程将由点与线的治理推进到面的治理，以便从根本上解除淮河流域的灾害。五河县境兴修的淮河干流和支流分流工程，正在继续施工。为排泄苏北灌溉总渠以北地区的积水而开挖的一条一百三十多公里长的排水渠，现已基本完工。此外，将要一面整理淮河支流包河、黑河、港河、涡河、窑河、泉河等河道，一面在北淝河沿河的二千四百平方公里的地区，宿县专区濉河流域部分地区，以及淮河以北、颍河以东、涡河以西、蒙城以南约五千平方公里的地区内，普遍开挖沟洫，打塘，筑堰等。这些农田水利工程将和淮河干流与各条支流构成网状的灌溉系统，并彻底地消除内涝灾害。
    为了统一治理全流域的内涝灾害，治淮委员会曾在去年十二月专门召开了一次消除内涝会议，确定了消除淮河流域内涝灾害的方针。接着，河南省治淮总指挥部和河南省人民政府水利局共同拟出了河南省的治涝方案，积极进行施工前的准备工作。安徽省北部规模较大的北淝河排水灌溉工程，早在去年冬季，治淮委员会就派出五个测量队作了两个月的测量和查勘，基本上完成了设计工作。现在，领导这个工程施工的指挥所已经成立，并正在动员民工和调运粮草，准备三月间动工。
