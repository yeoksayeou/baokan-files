    The Soviet state security organs have uncovered a spy-saboteur group driven by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Britain. This group of spy-saboteurs, disguised as scientists and doctors, shamelessly engaged in the criminal act of "plotting to murder the lives of Soviet leaders," murdering Comrades A.A. Zhdanov and A.S. Shcherbakov, and attempting to ruin the health of Soviet military leaders, rendering them unable to work, thereby weakening the national defense capabilities of the Soviet Union. However, this spy group, along with its ultimate despicable conspiracy, was finally and thoroughly crushed under the watchful eyes of the highly vigilant Soviet people. This is a major victory for Soviet state security work, a major victory for the Soviet people in the struggle to defend the cause of communist construction, and yet another victory for the people of the socialist and people's democratic countries in the common struggle against American aggression and in defense of peace.
    Imperialists have never relaxed their open and covert hostile activities against socialist and people's democratic countries. When open armed offensives, organized rebellion plans, and so on have failed or are simply impossible, the dying imperialists are bound to use even more despicable means to drive those vile thieves to carry out covert sabotage activities. The exposure of the conspiratorial acts manufactured by the spy-saboteur claws of U.S. and British imperialism and their running dogs, such as the Tito gang, in the people's democratic countries has fully exposed their devilish tricks. Now the Soviet Union has uncovered a group of murderers fostered by U.S. and British intelligence agencies, which further exposes that the means of covert sabotage by dying imperialism are unscrupulous.
    This case shows that as long as the forces of imperialist aggression have not been eliminated, we must not for a moment neglect the struggle against the sabotage and disruptive activities of imperialist spies, special agents, and all other counter-revolutionary elements. Comrade Stalin pointed out as early as in his report at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on March 3, 1937: "There are still many countries—bourgeois countries, still living a capitalist life, and surrounding the Soviet Union, waiting for the opportunity to invade it, smash it, or at least damage its power and weaken it." Therefore, "as long as the capitalist encirclement still exists, is it not obvious that in our rear there will continue to be saboteurs, spies, military saboteurs, and murderers sent by foreign intelligence agencies to engage in activities?" This also explains why there are still imperialist spies carrying out conspiratorial sabotage in the Soviet Union today.
    Although the Soviet Union has long eliminated the exploiting classes and built a socialist society, and is now carrying out the great construction of communism, the capitalist encirclement still exists because capitalism has not yet been eliminated in the world. Therefore, in the Soviet Union today, there will still be imperialist spies carrying out sabotage activities. Moreover, precisely because the Soviet Union is advancing more and more victoriously on the road to human light and happiness, those conspiratorial saboteurs will engage in even more desperate struggles. This was also estimated in Comrade Stalin's same report. He said: "The greater our progress in the future and the more achievements we make, the greater the hatred of the remnants of the defeated exploiting classes towards us. They will be even more determined to adopt more drastic forms of struggle and intensify their efforts to damage the Soviet state. They will make a final struggle by using the most adventurous and desperate means of struggle." The sabotage conspiracy of the special agent assassination group uncovered in the Soviet Union is precisely a manifestation of their final struggle.
    Some of these assassins are veteran spies, and some are hired spies. The fact that these degenerate elements are hired and willing to be imperialist spies proves that the ideological poisoning of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the Soviet Union, the ideas of socialism and communism have undoubtedly become the central ideas of the entire people; however, the remnants of capitalist ideology—the psychology of selfishness and self-interest, and the consciousness of individualism—cannot be completely eliminated quickly. Elements who adhere to these ideological remnants and are unwilling to accept education may be exploited by the reactionary forces of the capitalist world and become traitors to the motherland. This group of assassins is cloaked in the guise of doctors, scientists, and professors, and they seem to be senior intellectuals. However, because they hold reactionary bourgeois Zionist ideas and other ideas that oppose the working people, they have degenerated into the most despicable murderers. For dollars and pounds, they betrayed the motherland, sold themselves, and also sold science. This again proves the harmfulness of selfish and self-interested individualistic ideas. From this, it can be seen that it is of great significance to greatly strengthen patriotic education in the ideological education and transformation of intellectuals. People's scientists and people's intellectuals must first be patriots. Scientists and intellectuals who do not love the country or oppose loving the country are not wanted by the people.
    The Soviet people's exposure and arrest of this group of the most despicable spy-saboteur elements who betrayed the motherland demonstrates the strong and invincible socialist system and the unparalleled power of the inviolable Soviet people. In this respect, in carrying out resolute struggles against counter-revolutionary elements, and in strengthening the country's security work, as in other work, we must better learn from the Soviet Union and strive to overcome the serious phenomena of paralysis and lack of vigilance in our state organs and cadres. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out in a letter to all party comrades on January 18, 1935, because of the assassination of Comrade Kirov by special agent bandits: "It is necessary to eradicate the opportunistic sloppy attitude that takes wrong assumptions as its starting point. This wrong assumption is that as our strength grows, the enemy becomes more and more docile and softened. This assumption is fundamentally wrong." We must also learn from this experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and we must resolutely eradicate any erroneous ideas in our work that the enemy will relax their attacks on us and any opportunistic sloppy attitude that takes this as its starting point. We must not turn a blind eye to the heinous crimes of all spies and saboteurs. In order to protect the security of the motherland and the people, we must maintain the most vigilant minds at all times, resolutely and relentlessly continue to deepen the struggle to suppress counter-revolution, and give a devastating blow to any counter-revolutionary saboteurs who are unwilling to repent and surrender.

### 苏联国家保安工作的一个重大胜利

    苏联国家保安工作的一个重大胜利
    苏联国家保安机关破获了由美国和英国的情报机关所驱使的特务暗害分子的集团。这个集团的特务暗害分子，披着科学家和医生的外衣，可耻地做着“谋害苏联领导干部的性命”的罪恶勾当，谋害了安·亚·日丹诺夫同志和亚·塞·谢尔巴科夫同志的性命，并企图毁坏苏联军事领导干部的健康，使他们失去工作能力，从而削弱苏联的国家防御力量。但是，这个特务集团连同它的最后的卑鄙阴谋，终于在苏维埃人民的高度警惕性的觉察之下，彻底被粉碎了。这是苏联国家保安工作上的一个重大胜利，是苏联人民在保卫共产主义建设事业的斗争中的一个重大胜利，也是社会主义和人民民主阵营的各国人民在反对美国侵略、保卫和平事业的共同斗争中的又一个胜利。
    帝国主义者是从来不肯放松他们对社会主义和人民民主国家的公开的和隐蔽的敌对活动的。而在公开的武装进攻、组织叛变计划等等都失败了或根本不可能的时候，垂死的帝国主义者就必然更加要用卑鄙的手段，驱使那些下贱的蟊贼，进行隐蔽的破坏活动。美、英帝国主义及其走狗铁托等匪帮的间谍特务爪牙，在人民民主各国所制造的阴谋行为的破获，已经把它们的鬼蜮伎俩充分暴露出来了。现在苏联又破获了美、英间谍机关豢养的杀人犯集团，这就进一步暴露了垂死的帝国主义的隐蔽破坏的手段是无所不用其极的了。
    这个案件说明，在帝国主义侵略势力没有被消灭的时候，我们就一刻也不应该忽略了对帝国主义的间谍特务及其他一切反革命分子的暗害与破坏行为作斗争。斯大林同志在一九三七年三月三日联共中央全体会议上的报告中，早已指出：“还有许多国家——资产阶级国家，还继续过着资本主义的生活，并包围着苏联，时时刻刻等待时机，以便实行侵犯它，打碎它，或者至少是要损害它的威力而削弱它。”因此，“只要资本主义的包围依然存在，则在我国后方便将继续有被外国侦探机关派来的暗害者、侦探、军事破坏工作者及杀人凶手从事活动，这岂不是显而易见吗？”这也可以说明为什么今天的苏联还会有帝国主义的间谍特务进行阴谋暗害的原因了。
    苏联虽然早已消灭了剥削阶级，并且建成了社会主义社会，现在又正进行着伟大的共产主义的建设；但是，由于资本主义在世界上还未被消灭，资本主义的包围依然存在，因此，在今天的苏联，就仍然会有帝国主义的间谍特务进行破坏活动。而且，正因为苏联在人类光明幸福的道路上愈加胜利前进，那些阴谋破坏分子就愈加要进行绝望的挣扎。这在斯大林同志的同一个报告中也早已估计到了。他说：“我们今后的进展愈大，成绩愈多，则已被击破的剥削阶级之残余对我们的仇恨亦更甚。他们将更加决意采用更激烈的斗争方式，更其加紧损害苏维埃国家。他们将更利用最冒险拚命的斗争手段以作最后的挣扎。”现在苏联破获的特务暗害集团的暗害阴谋，正是他们最后挣扎的表现。
    这一批暗害者中有的是老牌的特务，有的是被雇用的特务。这些堕落分子所以会被雇用而甘心为帝国主义的特务，证明了资本主义的思想毒害是不可忽视的。在苏联，社会主义和共产主义的思想无疑地已经成为全体人民的中心思想；但是，资本主义的思想残余——自私自利的心理、个人主义的意识，还不可能很快就被完全消灭。坚持这种思想残余而不愿接受教育的分子，就有可能被资本主义世界的反动势力所利用而成为祖国的叛徒。这一批暗害者披着医生、科学家、教授的外衣，他们似乎都是高级知识分子，然而由于他们抱着反动的资产阶级的犹太复国主义思想和其他反对劳动人民的思想，他们竟堕落到最卑劣的杀人犯的地步。他们为了美元和英镑而背叛了祖国，出卖了自己，也出卖了科学。这又证明自私自利的个人主义思想的危害性。由此可见，在对知识分子的思想教育与改造工作中，大大加强爱国主义的教育是有极大意义的。人民的科学家、人民的知识分子，必须首先是一个爱国者，不爱国、反爱国的科学家和不爱国、反爱国的知识分子是人民所不要的。
    苏联人民揭露并逮捕了这一批出卖祖国的最卑贱的间谍特务分子，表示了坚强无敌的社会主义制度和不可侵犯的苏维埃人民的无比威力。在这一方面，在对反革命分子进行坚决的斗争，在加强国家的保安工作方面，也和在其他工作方面一样，我们必须更好地向苏联学习，努力克服我们国家机关和干部中的麻痹思想和缺乏警惕性的严重现象。苏联共产党中央在一九三五年一月十八日，因基洛夫同志被特务匪徒暗杀的事件，就曾在告全党同志的信中指出：“必须铲除那种以错误设想为出发点的机会主义的马虎态度。这种错误设想即是以为随着我们力量之增长，敌人就日益驯服和日益软化。这种设想是根本错误的。”我们也必须学习苏联共产党的这个经验，必须坚决铲除在我们工作中任何以为敌人会放松进攻我们的错误想法和任何以此为出发点的机会主义的马虎态度。我们对于一切间谍、特务暗害分子的滔天罪行，决不能视而不见。为着保卫祖国和人民的安全，我们必须时时刻刻保持最警醒的头脑，坚决无情地继续深入镇压反革命的斗争，给任何不愿意悔改投降的反革命破坏分子以毁灭的打击。
