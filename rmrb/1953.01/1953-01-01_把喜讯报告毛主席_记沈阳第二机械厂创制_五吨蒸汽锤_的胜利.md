    Report the Good News to Chairman Mao
    —On the Victory of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant in Creating the "Five-Ton Steam Hammer"
    Sun Bei
    The workers of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant recently created China's first self-made massive "five-ton steam hammer." [Note 1] The technical personnel and workers who participated in the trial production held a symposium on the eve of 1953—the new year when the country begins large-scale economic construction. They happily discussed writing a report of victory to tell the good news to Chairman Mao.
    The five-ton steam hammer had never been manufactured in China before. This machine is 9.5 meters high, weighs 150 tons, and has a maximum impact capacity of 43,800 kilogram-meters. [Note 2] In April 1952, when the technical personnel and workers of the plant received the task of trial-producing such a large steam hammer, they could not imagine what the hammer looked like. They had not only never seen it, but also had no drawings or materials to refer to. However, they had an idea in their minds: creating a large steam hammer was "for the industrialization of the motherland;" and "industrialization" symbolized "prosperity, happiness, and strength!" Therefore, they all had such a drive in their hearts: "Since the motherland needs it, we must complete it!" After seven months, they overcame layers of difficulties in design and manufacturing, and finally manufactured it, completing the task four months ahead of the state's requirement.
    At the symposium, the chief designer of the "five-ton steam hammer"—Shenyang City Labor Model Comrade Wang Zheng'an—excitedly and sincerely said to the person writing the report of victory: "Report to Chairman Mao: Our young technical personnel listened to Chairman Mao's words—learning from the Soviet Union and relying on the workers—to achieve such a great victory."
    The engineering and technical personnel who participated in the trial production of the "five-ton steam hammer" were all very young. Wang Zheng'an was only twenty-seven years old in 1952, and the technicians who worked with him were no older than him, with a maximum seniority of no more than four years. When the design work of the "five-ton steam hammer" began, the young technical personnel searched through all the reference books they could find, inquiring everywhere where there was such a large steam hammer, where there were drawings of such a large steam hammer. After spending a great deal of effort, all they found was a drawing of a 10,000-pound steam hammer bought from the United States during the Kuomintang rule, and there were many errors and unreasonable points in the design of that drawing. They also learned that a factory in a certain place had the only "five-ton steam hammer" in the country, but it was an old machine from forty years ago. How could they still manufacture an outdated machine according to the old model of forty years ago? They had to design a new machine with high efficiency, safe to use, easy to operate, and capable of being manufactured with the plant's equipment.
    Just as the young technicians were encountering many difficulties in the design and urgently needed a veteran master to guide them, they received a description of a three-ton steam hammer from the Soviet Union. From this description, they gained great enlightenment and began to design a five-ton steam hammer with reference to the drawings and descriptions of the Soviet three-ton steam hammer.
    The sketch of the "five-ton steam hammer" was drawn, but was it practical? The technicians could not give a definite answer. So they took the sketch to the forging workshop of the factory and discussed it with the most experienced veteran workers; they raised various doubts in the design and asked the workers in each workshop to help find solutions. With the help of veteran forger Liu Xiangming and other comrades, the height of the crossbeam of the steam hammer frame was changed from 1.8 meters to 1.9 meters, which facilitated the workers to move freely under the crossbeam during operation; and the connecting rod under the crossbeam was also raised by 20 centimeters, so that the steam hammer could forge larger workpieces. Similar major suggestions were put forward one after another by forging workers, foundry workers, metal processing workers, and assembly workers. They corrected the shortcomings in the design and enriched the design of the "five-ton steam hammer."
    The drawings were completely designed, but there were still many difficulties in manufacturing them. For example, the cylinder was too large and the existing horizontal lathe could not process it; the drill of the steam hammer weighed 32 tons, the crane in the processing workshop could not lift it, and there was no such a large boring machine to support the plane. How could this be solved? The young technicians put forward ten key issues and used the method of "topic reward" [Note 3] to discuss with the workers, and they were all solved. Technician Xu Dun designed a mobile boring machine based on the suggestions of four veteran technicians; technician Wang Yongjia designed a support rod for supporting the cylinder based on the suggestions of the workers; and the workers also found a way to improve the processing of the cylinder by using an old facing lathe. The forging workers worked actively, using a two-ton hammer to forge the hammerhead drill of the five-ton hammer. The workers' infinite wisdom and selfless labor spirit further encouraged the enthusiasm of the technicians. When designing the mobile boring machine, young technician Xu Dun created the "fast drawing method," which was originally a task that would have taken two people three months to complete, but he completed it in one month and ensured that there were no errors in the drawings.
    After experiments, the "five-ton steam hammer" proved that the trial production was completely successful. In the words of Comrade Wang Zheng'an, the experience of this success can be summarized as: "In this creation process, we have more deeply realized that Chairman Mao's teachings are extremely correct, and that to build a new China, we must learn from the Soviet Union and resolutely rely on the working class; at the same time, we believe that as long as we do the above two points and add our own efforts, we can improve our technical level and there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome!"
[Note 1] The tonnage of the "five-ton steam hammer" is not the weight of the machine itself, but only the weight of the hammerhead, tie rod, and piston.
[Note 2] The calculation method of "43,800 kilogram-meters" is: If you hit something weighing one kilogram upwards, you can hit it to a height of 43,800 meters.
[Note 3] "Topic reward" is to turn the problems that cannot be solved in production into topics, announce them to all employees, mobilize everyone to find tricks, invent, and create; and give certain rewards to employees who propose solutions.

    把喜讯报告毛主席
    ——记沈阳第二机械厂创制“五吨蒸汽锤”的胜利
    孙北
    沈阳第二机械厂职工最近创制了中国自制的第一台巨大的“五吨蒸汽锤”〔注一〕。参加试制工作的技术人员和工人，在一九五三年——这个全国开始大规模经济建设的新的年头就要到来的前夕，举行了一个座谈会，他们满心高兴地商量着写一个捷报，把喜讯报告毛主席。
    五吨重的蒸汽锤是中国从来没有制造过的。这个机器高有九公尺五十公分，体重一百五十吨，最大的打击能力有四万三千八百公斤米〔注二〕。一九五二年四月，该厂技术人员和工人接到试制这样大的汽锤任务的时候，还不能想像这个锤是什么样子，他们不但没有看见过，而且也没图样和资料可以参考。可是他们脑子里有一种想法：创制大汽锤是“为了祖国的工业化”；而“工业化”就象征着“繁荣、幸福和富强！”因此他们心里都有这么一股劲：“既然祖国需要，就必需完成它！”经过七个月的时间，他们冲破了设计和制造中的层层困难，终于把它制造出来了，而且比国家的要求提前四个月完成了任务。
    在座谈会上，“五吨蒸汽锤”的主要设计人——沈阳市劳动模范王铮安同志兴奋而诚恳地向写报捷报的人说道：“要报告毛主席：我们青年技术人员听了毛主席的话——向苏联学习，依靠工人，才得到了这样大的胜利。”
    参加“五吨蒸汽锤”试制工作的工程技术人员，都是很年青的。王铮安一九五二年只有二十七岁，和他一起工作的技术员都超不过他的年纪，最高工龄不过四年。“五吨蒸汽锤”的设计工作开始时，青年技术人员们翻遍了所有可以找到的参考书，到处打听那里有这样大的蒸汽锤，那里有这样大的蒸汽锤的图纸。花费了九牛二虎之力，他们所找到的只是国民党统治时期从美国买来的一份一万磅蒸汽锤的图纸，而且在那图纸的设计中还有很多错误和不合理之处。他们又打听到某地工厂有一台全国唯一的“五吨蒸汽锤”，但已经是四十年前的老机器了。现在怎么能还照四十年前的老样子来制造过了时的机器呢？他们必须设计效能高的，使用安全，操作方便的，而且是本厂设备能力能够制造的新机器。
    正当青年技术员们在设计中碰到很多困难无法解决，迫切需要一个老师傅来指导的时候，收到了苏联寄来的一份三吨蒸汽锤的说明。从这个说明中，他们得到很大的启示，并开始参照苏联三吨蒸汽锤的图样说明，进行设计五吨蒸气锤。
    “五吨蒸汽锤”的草图绘制出来了，实用不实用呢？技术员们不能作肯定的答复。于是他们把草图拿到工厂的锻冶车间，找最有经验的老工人商量；提出设计里的各种疑难，请各车间的工人们帮助想办法。经老锻工刘相名等同志的帮助，改变了汽锤架体横梁的高度，由一公尺八十公分上升为一公尺九十公分，便于工人操作时在横梁下自由来往；并把横梁下的连杆也提高了二十公分，使汽锤能够锻造更大的工作物。类似这样重大的建议，一个接着一个由锻冶工人、翻砂工人、金属加工工人、装配工人提了出来。改正了设计中的缺点，丰富了“五吨蒸汽锤”的设计。
    图纸完全设计出来了，但制造起来还有很多困难。如汽缸太大，现有的躺镟不能加工；汽锤的钻子有三十二吨重，加工车间的吊车吊不动，而且没有那么大的摚床来摚平面。这又怎么解决呢？青年技术员们拟出十个关键问题，用“课题悬赏”〔注三〕的办法来和工人商量，也都得到了解决。技术员徐敦根据四位老技术工人的建议，设计了一部活动摚床；技术员王永嘉根据工人的建议，设计了一个摚汽缸用的摚杆；又经工人们想办法利用一台破旧的对头镟改进了汽缸的加工工作。锻冶工人积极工作，用两吨锤来锻造五吨锤的锤头钻子。工人们的无穷智慧和忘我的劳动精神，更鼓舞了技术员的工作热情。青年技术员徐敦在设计活动摚床时，创造了“快速制图法”，本来应该用两个人三个月才能完成的工作，他在一个月内就完成了，并保证了图纸没有差错。
    “五吨蒸汽锤”经过实验，证明试制工作完全成功。用王铮安同志的话，概括这次成功的经验就是：“在这个创制过程中，更深刻地体会到毛主席的教导是万分正确的，建设新中国必须学习苏联和坚决依靠工人阶级；同时使我们相信，只要做到以上两点再加上自己的努力，就可以提高技术水平，就没有打不倒的困难！”〔注一〕“五吨蒸汽锤”的吨数不是机器的体重，
    只是锤头、拉杆和活塞的重量。〔注二〕“四万三千八百公斤米”的计算方法是：
    往上打一公斤重的东西，可以打出四万三千
    八百米高。〔注三〕“课题悬赏”是把生产中不能解决的问题
    做成题目，向全体职工公布，动员大家找窍
    门，发明创造；对提出解决办法的职工给以
    一定的奖励。
