    中南军政委员会讨论改变机构与任务问题
    【新华社汉口八日电】中南军政委员会在七日举行第六次会议。会议总结了中南军政委员会三年来的工作，讨论了如何执行中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议通过的关于改变大行政区人民政府机构与任务的决定的问题。
    中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢在会上作了报告。他说：三年以来，我们忠实地执行了、并且完成了中央人民政府和毛泽东主席以及中南全区人民交付给我们的各项任务，取得了巨大的成就。现在，国家的经济建设已经开始了，从此将进入一个崭新的历史时期，中南军政委员会已圆满地完成了自己的历史任务，这次会议就是着重研究如何结束我们这一个历史阶段的工作。邓子恢指出：三年以来，军事方面，共歼敌一百六十七万多人，全部地肃清了全区的匪患；政治方面，经过土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命和工矿民主改革等四大运动，消灭了地主阶级、官僚资产阶级和帝国主义残余，发动了群众；经济方面，恢复和发展了工农业生产，恢复了交通运输，稳定了金融物价，调整了工商业，开展了物资交流；文教卫生方面，兴办了各种学校，发展了人民的艺术，广泛地开展了爱国卫生运动；组织建设方面，逐步健全了各级政权机构和加强了和人民群众的联系，培养和提拔了大批干部。从这些方面来看，毛主席所指示的三年准备工作已基本完成了。现在要适应经济建设的新形势和新任务，改变大行政区政权机构与任务是很适时和正确的。
    中南军政委员会副主席程潜、张难先、李先念、李雪峰和委员冯白驹、李章达、覃应机、黄琪翔、陈经畲等在会上相继发言，一致表示拥护中央人民政府改变大行政区政权机构与任务的决定和同意邓子恢报告中所提出的关于中南区三年来的工作总结。回顾过去和瞻望未来，他们满怀信心地表示：今后要在毛主席、中央人民政府、中国共产党领导下，在即将组成的行政委员会的领导下，紧密团结各民族各阶层人民群众，为祖国的建设而努力。
