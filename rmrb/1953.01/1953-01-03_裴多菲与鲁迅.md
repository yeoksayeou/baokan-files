    Petőfi and Lu Xun
    Wu Wen

    Petőfi is Hungary's greatest poet and also the most well-known Hungarian writer in our country. He was introduced to China as early as forty-five years ago. Mr. Lu Xun's critical biography of him in "On the Power of Mara Poetry," though only about a thousand words, depicted the poet's life so vividly and precisely that it could only have been written with love for him; Mr. Lu Xun himself said in the "Postscript" to "Grave" twenty years later: "How much their names excited me before!"
    A year after the publication of "On the Power of Mara Poetry," he translated a chapter from the "History of Hungarian Literature" by the Hungarian writer Lajos Hevesi: "Petőfi's Poetry," published in the seventh issue of "Henan" magazine in 1908, but "unfinished."
    In the seventh essay of "Wild Grass," "Hope," Mr. Lu Xun quoted a song of "Hope" by Petőfi, which he also translated, of course. In addition to this one, he also translated five short poems, all published in the "Yu Si" weekly in January 1925, among which "My Father and My Craft" is the most famous one that moved many people.
    In the second volume, fifth issue of "Torrent" in December 1929, there was "Petőfi Sándor" by Austrian Dér Erzsi, translated by Bai Mang; Mr. Lu Xun said in the "Editor's Postscript": "When I received the first piece 'Petőfi's Biography,' it evoked my memories of youth, because he was the poet I admired at that time. It is natural for people under the Qing government to resonate with the hero who resisted the Russian Emperor."
    A year and a little more after publishing this "Biography," the translator Bai Mang and several other revolutionary writers were murdered in Longhua, Shanghai, by the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, Mr. Lu Xun wrote the seven-character律诗 [lǜ shī] "I bear to see friends become new ghosts, angrily seeking small poems in a thicket of knives"; two years and two months later, he wrote "Forgetting Remembrance," commemorating the several young writers who were killed, especially Rou Shi and Bai Mang. In this article, he also described Petőfi's works at considerable length, revealing his respect and love, and explained that the eight short poems by Petőfi translated by Bai Mang, which were published together with "Petőfi's Biography," were translated at his suggestion.
    Mr. Lu Xun devoted much more effort to Petőfi's long poem "János Vitéz" ("Brave John"). Because he loved this poet and his poems, he proofread the translation, introduced its publication, wrote a "Postscript," and even paid for the illustrations, so that the exquisite first edition was finally printed. Of the fourteen letters in "Lu Xun's Letters" to Sun Yong, ten are about "János Vitéz" (written from 1929 to 1931).
    In March 1935, Mr. Lu Xun, in the preface to "A Compendium of New Chinese Literature: Fiction, Second Series," which he compiled, recalled a small poem by Petőfi and even translated it into prose. In September of the same year, in an essay entitled "Seven Essays on 'Mutual Disparagement of Literati' – Two Wounded," he called on literati to "attack 'dissidents' with ardent hatred, and also resist 'dead preachers' with ardent hatred." After saying, "In this 'pathetic' era, one can only live by killing, only love by hating, and only write by living and loving," he then quoted the last four lines of Petőfi's eight-line poem, which he had translated ten years earlier as "My Love—Is Not…"
    Mr. Lu Xun loved all the poets in "On the Power of Mara Poetry," because they were "all strong and unyielding, holding sincerity and guarding truth… expressing themselves with heroic voices, to awaken their countrymen and make their country great in the world." However, from shortly after he began his literary life until a year before his death, in nearly thirty years, he remembered only Petőfi, and he translated the works only of Petőfi.
    In Hungary, the great Petőfi is eternally immortal; in our country, thanks to Mr. Lu Xun's introduction, he is also eternally immortal!

    裴多菲与鲁迅
    吴文
    裴多菲是匈牙利最伟大的诗人，也是我国最熟识的匈牙利作家。四十五年之前，他就被介绍到中国来了。鲁迅先生写在“摩罗诗力说”中的他的评传，不过一千字吧，却画出了这诗人的一生，如果没有对于他的热爱，是不能写得这么生动精当的；鲁迅先生自己也在二十年后的“坟”的“题记”中说过：“他们的名，先前是怎样地使我激昂呵！”
    “摩罗诗力说”发表后一年，他又翻译了匈牙利籁赫所作“匈牙利文学史”中的一章：“裴彖飞（按：即裴多菲）诗论”，发表于一九○八年的“河南”杂志第七期，但“未完”。
    在“野草”的第七篇：“希望”中，鲁迅先生引了一首裴多菲的“希望”之歌，当然也是他译的。除了这一首，他还译了五首短诗，都在一九二五年一月间的“语丝”周刊上发表，其中一首“我的父亲的和我的手艺”，就是感动了许多人的最著名的一首。
    一九二九年十二月“奔流”第二卷第五本中，有白莽所译、奥国德?尔思所作的“彼得斐（按：即裴多菲）·山陀尔”；鲁迅先生在“编辑后记”中说：“收到第一篇‘彼得斐行状’时，很引起我青年时的回忆，因为他是我那时所敬仰的诗人。在满清政府之下的人，共鸣于反抗俄皇的英雄，也是自然的事。”
    在发表了这“行状”之后一年又一个多月，译者白莽及其他几位革命作家就在上海龙华被国民党反动派杀害，鲁迅先生当时写下了“忍看朋辈成新鬼，怒向刀丛觅小诗”的那首七律；过了两年又两月，他又写下了“为了忘却的记念”，记着对于被害的几个青年作家，尤其是柔石和白莽的悼惜。在这一篇文章里，也以不小的篇幅，叙述了裴多菲的作品，流露着敬爱的心情，而且说明了与“彼得斐行状”一同发表，白莽所译的八首裴多菲的短诗，是由于他的提议而译的。
    关于裴多菲的长诗“勇敢的约翰”，鲁迅先生更费了很多的精力。他因了很爱这诗人及其诗，所以为这译本校定字句，介绍出版，为它写“校后记”，又为它垫钱印制插画，那精美的初版，这才终于印成。“鲁迅书简”给孙用的十四封信，关于“勇敢的约翰”的就有十封（写于一九二九至三一年）。
    一九三五年三月，鲁迅先生在所编选的“中国新文学大系：小说二集”的序文中，又记起了裴多菲的一首小诗，还将它译成了散文。同年九月，他在题为“七论‘文人相轻’—两伤”的杂文中，要文人“以热烈的憎，向‘异己’者进攻，还得以热烈的憎，向‘死的说教者’抗战。”在说了“在现在这‘可怜’的时代，能杀才能生，能憎才能爱，能生与爱，才能文”之后，接着就引了裴多菲的八行诗，原是他在十年前所译的“我的爱——并不是……”的后半首。
    “摩罗诗力说”中的几位诗人，鲁迅先生都很爱好，因为他们“无不刚健不挠，抱诚守真……发为雄声，以起其国人之新生，而大其国于天下。”然而从他开始文学生活不久，一直到逝世前一年，在将近三十年之间，他时时记起的却只有裴多菲一人，他译了诗作的也只有裴多菲一人。
    在匈牙利，伟大的裴多菲是永远不朽的；在我国，因有鲁迅先生的介绍，他也是永远不朽的！
