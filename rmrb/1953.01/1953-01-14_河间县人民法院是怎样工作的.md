Editor's Note: The Hejian County People's Court of Hebei Province, in coordination with the central tasks of various periods, has promoted mass movements, suppressed enemies, protected the people, and effectively handled disputes among the people in a way that is most convenient for the people. It has also conducted legal and disciplinary propaganda and education, strengthened internal unity among the people, prevented crime, and ensured the smooth progress of various construction undertakings. This whole set of practices has enabled the People's Court to play the role of a powerful weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship. This is a good tradition of the people's judicial work and should be carried forward.

The current judicial reform movement in various places has entered the construction phase. How to create new work experiences, summarize and commend model deeds in the people's judicial work (including good courts and model figures), and consolidate the achievements of the judicial reform movement has become an urgent task for various places. This task requires judicial workers in various places to carry out their work with the greatest enthusiasm and creativity. The spirit of creation shown by the Hejian People's Court in this regard is worth learning from.

In the judicial reform movement, people's judicial organs in various places have exposed many phenomena of impure organization and impure ideological style, but they have also discovered that some judicial organs have consistently relied on the masses, effectively served politics, served the people, and played the role of a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship. The People's Court of Hejian County, Hebei Province, is one such example.

Mobilizing the Masses to Fight Counter-revolutionaries

In the great movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the Hejian County People's Court concentrated all its manpower to serve the movement. With the exception of one cadre (later two) left in the court to handle general daily cases, the court president and the other five cadres all devoted themselves to this movement.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the struggle between the enemy and ourselves in Hejian County was extremely cruel and sharp. A total of 1,981 revolutionary cadres and people were killed by counter-revolutionaries in the county. After liberation, the masses urgently demanded the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In order to meet the people's just demands, Hejian County adopted the method of holding memorial services for the deceased martyrs, denouncing the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements, and combining them with public trials by the court to vigorously attack the enemy in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Under the leadership of the county, the Public Security Bureau, the court, and relevant departments and representatives from all walks of life presided over the convening of a public memorial and trial conference. The masses presented wreaths, elegiac couplets, and elegiac words, and carried the memorial tablets of the revolutionary cadres and masses who had been killed by the Japanese invaders since they arrived in Hejian to the conference. The main cadres of the county took the lead in welcoming them. The families of the martyrs who attended the meeting all carried martyr certificates and were respected and treated well. Stores offered discounted preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers. The conference held a grand memorial ceremony. Inside the martyrs' memorial shed, there were serial pictures of the martyrs leading the people in the struggle against the enemy and the various criminal activities of the counter-revolutionary elements, as well as lists, crimes, and judgments of the counter-revolutionary criminals who were dealt with at this conference. This formed a mass memorial, which aroused the masses' hatred of class enemies. Every day, the number of viewers and listeners to the memorial shed reached six to seven thousand people. Many people cried when they saw these memorial tablets. Forty thousand people attended the formal public memorial and trial conference. At the meeting, court cadres made a report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the masses denounced the 14 counter-revolutionary criminals. The most heinous counter-revolutionary criminals were sentenced to death and executed immediately. The masses cheered enthusiastically, which powerfully promoted and launched the mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

In order to make the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries more deeply developed, Hejian County selected various typical cases for collective sentencing, using living people and facts to embody the policy of combining suppression with leniency, educating the masses, and attacking and disintegrating the enemy.

When trying a large number of cases, Hejian County adopted the method of taking the files down to the countryside, mobilizing the masses to verify the facts, and assessing the sentences, that is, the method of relying on the masses to handle cases under the leadership of the court. This not only handled a large number of cases quickly and correctly, but also effectively educated the masses.

Handling Typical Cases to Prevent Criminal Behavior

The Hejian County People's Court is good at seizing typical cases, handling them in a timely manner, and conducting extensive publicity to achieve the effect of preventing crime. For example, in April and May of 1952, Hejian County was experiencing a drought, and the leadership mobilized the masses of the county to dig wells to fight the drought. Hui Shidun (member of the District Committee of the Youth League) and Hui Qiaoman, a women's affairs committee member, of Hui Village in the Fourth District, had always been domineering in the village. While digging the well, the woman Hui Bian was tied up and paraded through the streets by Hui Shidun because she arrived a little late. The next day, Hui Shidun and Hui Qiaoman tied up and beat a woman named Hui Wen, causing her injury. The masses were extremely dissatisfied with this, and the morale for digging wells declined. After receiving Hui Wen's complaint, the Hejian County People's Court believed that this issue was very serious and that the correct handling of this case was related to the masses' production morale and drought resistance work. Therefore, they reported to the party and government leaders, obtained their support, and, together with the County Women's Federation, the Youth League, the People's Supervision Committee, the Civil Affairs Section, the Armed Forces Department, and other departments, organized an inspection team (i.e., a trial team) led by the president of the court to conduct an inspection and trial. After clarifying the facts, the Youth League members' congress first revoked Hui Shidun's position in the Youth League and expelled him from the League; the Women's Federation also revoked Hui Qiaoman's position as a women's affairs committee member. Then, a mass meeting of the whole village was convened, and the president of the court announced the government's policies to the masses and sentenced Hui Shidun and Hui Qiaoman to fixed-term imprisonment in public. The County Civil Affairs Section, the People's Supervision Committee, and the Armed Forces Department also criticized and educated or administratively punished the relevant derelict personnel. The timely handling of this case enabled the drought resistance work in Hui Village to develop rapidly. The village originally planned to dig five wells, but completed fourteen. Afterwards, the county leadership notified the whole county of this matter, which was of great educational significance to the cadres.

The Hejian County People's Court also often cooperates with central tasks to conduct mobile sentencing. In May of 1952, it selected eight representative ordinary criminal cases to be sentenced at mass meetings in various districts and villages, and explained policies to the masses to conduct legal and disciplinary education. After the meeting, the masses and village cadres were organized to discuss, which was very effective. For example, Zhao Shazi, who set fire to other people's wheat stalks out of personal revenge, was sentenced to imprisonment and compensated the victims for various losses. After public sentencing and publicity, no arson cases occurred in the county during the wheat harvest and autumn harvest of 1952.

How to Handle Disputes Among the People

The Hejian County People's Court handles disputes among the people by adopting the method of going to the countryside for circuit trials. Facts have proved that this method of trial is most welcomed by the peasant masses. When carrying out this work, the Hejian County People's Court generally first classifies and "queues" the cases in the court, analyzes and studies each case, determines preliminary handling opinions, selects areas with concentrated cases, seizes the gap in agricultural production, goes deep into the rural areas, convenes relevant district and village cadres, peasant representatives, parties concerned, and absorbs as many masses as possible to participate, and handles typical cases. When handling typical cases, the policies are specifically and vividly explained, combined with criticizing certain erroneous ideas of certain parties, and then a large number of similar cases are handed over to the masses for evaluation, so that the cases can be concluded correctly and quickly. For example, in May of last year, the Hejian County People's Court handled a large number of cases where women took away property when they divorced. These cases were of the same nature, and the reasons for their occurrence were mostly due to the male's ideological obstruction and the existence of localism among some village cadres (who were unwilling for women to take away the land of their village). These cases continued to occur, and although the court had sentenced many, the parties refused to execute them. The Hejian County People's Court adopted the method of joint village collective mediation, and after handling typical cases, similar cases were resolved.

Working in Close Cooperation with Relevant Departments Under the Unified Leadership of the Party and Government

The Hejian County People's Court has always been working under the unified leadership of the local party and government and in close cooperation with various departments and district and village cadres. This is not only because the Hejian County People's Court has fewer cadres and can only rely on close cooperation with all parties, but also because many cases accepted by the court involve complex social issues; many cases cannot be solved solely by the power of the judicial organs and solely by judicial means. Therefore, after discovering such problems, the Hejian County People's Court often studies the situation first, puts forward opinions, and formulates methods to strive for the support of the party and government leadership. The handling of the case of Hui Shidun and others beating Hui Wen is a notable example. Doing so not only greatly promoted the work of the court, but also promoted the central work and the work of other relevant departments. For example, in August of last year, the Cangxian Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court discovered that there had been many cases of abnormal deaths in the past year or so, and immediately provided this situation to the Cangxian Prefecture leadership for research. The Cangxian Prefectural Office immediately instructed each county to organize forces to conduct inspections. The result of Hejian County's conduct of this work was not only that the court cleared up the backlog of abnormal death cases, but also that the hospitals checked the problems of death due to untreated illnesses, the Civil Affairs Section checked the problems in preferential treatment and disaster relief work, the Women's Federation checked the situation of women being abused to death, and the People's Supervision Committee checked the situation of cadres violating laws and regulations. In this way, due to the leadership's attention and the cooperation of various aspects of work, the phenomenon of abnormal death was gradually overcome. Obviously, the close cooperation between relevant departments and the court is only correct when starting from the overall perspective of promoting all aspects of work and completely solving problems.

"Inquiry Office" Welcomed by the Masses

The "Inquiry Office" of the Hejian County People's Court is also extremely welcomed by the masses. The "Inquiry Office" is actually a package of "street-front court" that integrates the "Inquiry Office," the "People's Reception Room," the "Judge on Duty System," and the "Summary Court" (see the article "The 'Inquiry Office' of the People's Court of Hejian County, Hebei Province" on page 3 of this newspaper on December 22, 1952). Its characteristics are that it has no gatekeepers, does not require written complaints, can provide document writing services, and the masses can get timely processing for inquiries and lawsuits. In the mediation of cases in the Inquiry Office, many masses participate in the audience and learn the principles. This can not only carry out legal and disciplinary education to the masses according to the case, but also mobilize everyone to express their opinions and participate in discussions for the parties who insist on mistakes. In this way, it often forms a mass criticism, so that the case can be successfully concluded.

    河间县人民法院是怎样工作的
    陈希
    编者按：河北省河间县人民法院配合各时期各项中心工作，推动群众运动，镇压敌人，保护人民，并以最便利于人民的方法有效地处理人民中间的纠纷，进行法纪的宣传教育，加强人民内部的团结，预防犯罪，保障各项建设事业顺利进行的一整套做法，使人民法院发挥了人民民主专政的有力武器的作用。这是人民司法工作的好的传统，应当加以发扬。
    现在各地所进行的司法改革运动，已进入建设阶段，如何创造新的工作经验，并总结和表扬人民司法工作中的模范事迹（包括好的法院和模范人物），把司法改革运动的成果巩固起来，成为目前各地迫切的任务。这一任务，要求各地司法工作者以最大的积极性和创造性去开展工作。河间人民法院在这方面所表现出来的创造精神，是值得学习的。
    在司法改革运动中，各地人民司法机关暴露了许多组织不纯和思想作风不纯的现象，但也发现了不少司法机关一贯依靠群众，有效地为政治服务，为人民服务，发挥了人民民主专政的武器的作用。河北省河间县人民法院就是一例。
    发动群众与反革命作斗争
    在伟大的镇压反革命运动中，河间县人民法院集中一切人力为运动服务。除留干部一人（后来是二人）在法院处理一般日常案件外，法院院长及其他五个干部全部投入这一运动。
    河间县在抗日战争和解放战争时期，敌我斗争十分残酷，尖锐。全县先后被反革命杀害的革命干部和人民共计一千九百八十一人。解放后，群众迫切要求镇压反革命。为了满足人民的正义要求，河间县在镇压反革命运动中，采取了追悼死难烈士、控诉反革命分子罪行，并结合法庭公审的办法，大张旗鼓地打击敌人。在县的领导下，公安局、法院与有关部门及各界代表主持召开了公祭公审大会。群众纷纷献花圈、挽联、挽词，并把日寇到河间以来被杀害的革命干部与群众的灵牌抬到大会。县主要干部带头迎接。到会的烈属都带着烈属证，受到尊敬和招待。商店对烈属军属减价优待。大会举行了隆重的祭典。烈士灵棚内张贴着烈士领导人民对敌斗争以及反革命分子种种罪恶活动的连环画，张贴着此次大会处理的反革命罪犯的名单、罪行与判决书。这样便形成了群众性的追悼，激发了群众对阶级敌人的仇恨。每天到灵棚的观众与听众达六、七千人之多。很多人看到这些灵牌就哭了起来。正式的公祭与公审大会有四万人参加。会上，法院干部作了镇压反革命的报告，群众对十四名反革命罪犯进行了控诉。当场判处罪大恶极的反革命罪犯以死刑并立即执行。群众热烈欢呼，从而有力地推动和展开了群众性的镇压反革命运动。
    为了使镇压反革命运动更加深入地开展，河间县选择了各种典型案件进行集体宣判，用活人活事体现镇压与宽大相结合的政策，教育群众，打击和瓦解敌人。
    河间县审判大批案犯时是采取带卷下乡，发动群众对证事实，评定量刑的方法，即是在法庭领导下依靠群众办案的方法。既迅速、正确地处理了大批案犯，同时也有效地教育了群众。
    处理典型案件，预防犯罪行为
    河间县人民法院善于抓住典型案件，及时处理，并做广泛宣传，以收预防犯罪之效。例如在一九五二年四、五月间，河间县田地干旱，领导上发动全县群众打井抗旱。第四区回庄村干部回石墩（青年团区委委员）与妇女委员回巧漫等，一向在村中称王称霸。在打井时，妇女回编因为晚到了一会，被回石墩捆吊起来，并强迫游街。第二天回石墩、回巧漫又把一个名叫回稳的妇女捆打成伤。群众对此极为不满，打井情绪低落下来。河间县人民法院接到回稳的控告后，认为这个问题很严重，能否正确处理这一案件，关系群众的生产情绪和抗旱工作。因此，即向党政领导干部报告，取得支持，会同县妇联、青年团、人民监察委员会、民政科、武装部等部门，组织了检查组（即审判组），由法院院长领导进行检查和审处。查明事实后，先由团员大会撤销了回石墩在团内的职务，开除其团籍；妇女会也撤销了回巧漫妇女委员的职务。接着召开了全村群众大会，由法院院长向群众宣布了政府的政策，当众判处回石墩、回巧漫以有期徒刑。县民政科、人民监察委员会和武装部也对有关失职人员分别进行了批评教育或行政处分。这一案件的及时处理，使回庄村的抗旱工作迅速开展。该村原计划打井五眼，结果完成了十四眼。事后，县领导机关把这一件事通报全县，对干部教育意义很大。
    河间县人民法院还经常配合中心工作作流动性的宣判。一九五二年五月间，曾选择了有代表性的八种普通刑事案到各区村的大会上宣判，并讲解政策向群众进行法纪教育。会后又组织群众和村干部讨论，收效很大。例如因报私仇而放火烧人家麦杆的赵傻子被判处徒刑，并赔偿被害主的各种损失。经过公开的宣判与宣传，一九五二年麦收与秋收时，全县没有发生过一件放火案件。
    怎样处理人民之间的纠纷
    河间县人民法院处理人民内部纠纷，是采取了下乡巡回就审的方式。事实证明，这种审判方式最为农民群众所欢迎。河间县人民法院在进行这一工作时，一般的是先在法院把案件分类“排队”，逐案分析研究，决定初步的处理意见，选择案件集中的地区，抓住农业生产间隙，深入农村，召集有关区村干部、农民代表、当事人、及尽可能吸收群众参加，处理典型案件。在处理典型案件时，具体生动地交代政策，结合批判某些当事人的某些错误思想，然后把同类大量案件交由群众评议，这样就会正确迅速地结案。如去年五月间，河间县人民法院曾处理了大批妇女离婚带走财产的案件。这类案件性质相同，发生的原因多由于男方思想不通和一些村干部存在本位主义思想（不愿女方带走本村土地）所致。这类案件不断发生，法院虽曾判决不少，但当事人抗不执行。河间县人民法院采取联村集体调解的方式，处理了典型案件以后，同类案件都解决了。
    在党政统一领导之下，和有关部门通力合作进行工作
    河间县人民法院一向都是在当地党政统一领导下与各部门及区村干部通力合作下进行工作的。这不仅因为河间县人民法院干部较少，只有依靠与各方面通力合作；尤其因为法院所受理的许多案件，本身就涉及到复杂的社会问题；许多案件也绝不是单靠司法机关的力量和单靠司法手段所能解决的。因此，河间县人民法院在发现这样的问题后，常常是先研究情况，提出意见，订出办法，来争取党政领导方面的支持。处理回石墩等打伤回稳一案就是一个显著的例子。这样做不仅大大地推动了法院的工作，也推动了中心工作与其他有关部门的工作。又如去年八月间，河北省人民法院沧县分院发现一年多来发生不少的非正常死亡的案件，即将这一情况提供沧县专区领导机关研究。沧县专署随即指示各县组织力量进行检查。河间县对这一工作进行的结果，不仅是法院清理了非正常死亡的积案，卫生院也检查了因病不治而死的问题，民政科也检查了优抚救灾工作中的问题，妇联检查了妇女受虐待致死的情况，人民监察委员会检查了干部违法乱纪的情况。这样，由于领导上的重视与各方面工作的配合，非正常死亡的现象被逐渐克服了。显然，有关部门与法院的通力合作，只有从推进各方面工作和彻底地解决问题的全面观点出发才是正确的。
    受群众欢迎的问事处
    河间县人民法院的“问事处”，也极受群众欢迎。“问事处”实际是综合了“问事处”、“人民接待室”、“审判员值日制”、“简易法庭”的一揽子“临街法庭”（详见一九五二年十二月二十二日本报第三版“河北省河间县人民法院的‘问事处’”一文）。它的特点是既无门岗，也不要状子，还可以代书，群众来此询问、起诉，更能得到及时处理。问事处在调解案件中，不少群众参加旁听，学道理。这既可以根据案件向群众进行法纪教育，同时对于坚持错误的当事人，也可以发动大家发表意见，参加讨论，这样，往往形成群众性的批评，使案件得以顺利了结。
