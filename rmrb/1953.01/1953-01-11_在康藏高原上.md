    On the Kang Tibetan Plateau
    Central Nationalities Health Work Team Member Qu Qinglian

    The Birth of a New Life
    One day after a snow, when the weather was clearing up—it was the third day that our Central Nationalities Health Work Team had opened a clinic in the Luokema pastoral area. The sun was setting, and the number of patients at the clinic was gradually decreasing. At this moment, someone suddenly shouted:
    "Comrade Qu, come quickly! Come quickly!" When I rushed into the gynecology examination room, a woman was saying to the translation comrade, "I feel very uncomfortable. Please ask your female Menba (doctor) to examine me and see what's wrong." The examination result confirmed that she was about to give birth.
    This woman's name was Gai Luojin, a herdsman around forty years old. This was her first child. Her home wasn't here, and the clinic was in a lama temple. According to Tibetan customs, women are not allowed to give birth in lama temples. What to do? The comrades in the maternal and child health group became a little anxious. They had to support the pregnant woman, carrying the delivery kit, and walk towards a dark and dim thatched hut on a nearby hillside. The owner of the house was an eighty-year-old woman. She had never seen a child being born in a house, let alone experienced a stranger giving birth in her own home. However, seeing how concerned we were about the pregnant woman, the old woman was moved and finally agreed to lend us the house.
    It got dark. The weather turned bad, with wind and snow howling outside. Inside the house, the pregnant woman groaned in pain from time to time. At this time, an old woman in her fifties knocked on the door asking for shelter. As soon as she entered and saw that someone was about to give birth in the house, she shouted, "Go out, go to the grassland. Giving birth in the house will cause trouble." Before we could explain, the old woman kindly said to her, "The wind and snow are heavy, let her give birth in the house. The comrades from the health team are personally guarding her here, nothing will happen."
    It was midnight. Gai Luojin felt very painful due to the accelerated contraction of her uterus and would not even listen to us. She blew out the lamp and extinguished the little flame in the stove pit. Everyone waited in the dark house with a sense of anxiety. Around three o'clock in the morning, the pregnant woman began to calm down. This was a sign of impending labor. We quickly turned on the flashlight and asked the pregnant woman to lie down. Before she could lie down properly, we heard a "wow" sound, and a new life was born. We carried out all postpartum care under the light of the flashlight.
    As soon as it was dawn, we placed the child beside Gai Luojin. Gai Luojin stroked the child, her face flashing with a motherly smile. She said to us gratefully, "During the reactionary rule, women who gave birth were often driven out, and no one cared about their life or death. Today, you patiently guarded me all night, did everything yourselves, didn't mind getting dirty, and used your clothes to wrap the child. When I lost my temper, you didn't get angry at all..." She gestured with her hand and said, "Gecai Lao! Gecai Lao (meaning thank you)!" The two old women also said in unison: "Gecai Lao, Chairman Mao Yamu Yamu de (meaning too good)!"
    Ten days later, Gai Luojin listened to our advice and brought her child to get vaccinated. The child had no name, and we gave him a name called "Xinsheng" (New Life). Gai Luojin shouted happily in Tibetan, "Xinsheng, Xinsheng."

    Children's Paradise
    In Luhuo County, the weather is gradually getting colder, and the Tibetan people are busy with the autumn harvest. Every day at dawn, a burst of laughter and talking can be heard on the street. Although we can't fully understand these languages, our experience in recent days tells us that the Tibetan people are going to the fields to harvest highland barley. Fewer and fewer people are coming to the health team for medical treatment, so we took advantage of this time to start a new task.
    In such a season of great harvest, Tibetan women have to go to the fields to harvest highland barley and take care of their children, so they feel very distressed and worried. Some entrust their young children to older children to take care of; some give their children a little wine to drink so they fall asleep drunkenly; some simply carry their children out and place them on the edge of the field, exposed to the sun and wind. When it's cloudy and rainy, mothers have to stay at home to take care of them because they love their children. The Democratic Women's Federation and the maternal and child health group of the health team learned about this situation and discussed trying to set up a busy farming season nursery. With the help of the women's group, we borrowed two earthen houses and a small courtyard, and the nursery was established. The comrades from the Democratic Women's Federation and the maternal and child health group shared the childcare work. The children began a new happy life under the care of these "aunties" (i.e., childcare workers). Every morning, the "aunties" washed the children's faces and hands clean. When it was time to eat, they let the young children drink warm milk, and the older children ate buttered tsampa. After they were full, some slept quietly, some babbled, and some knocked on small drums and gongs, sang, and played games in the yard. They no longer rolled around covered in mud like they used to.
    The nursery became a children's paradise. Li Xia, who was just over a year old, although her mother didn't register her at first, ran to the nursery every day before dawn. In the yard, she kept running around and shouting, and people couldn't guess how happy she was.
    According to the scheduled date, the work of the nursery should have ended, but because some villagers had not finished their autumn harvest, the work of the nursery had to be extended by five days. On the day the nursery work officially ended, we held a mothers' meeting. At the meeting, the mothers were so grateful that they didn't know what to say. Gao Jiying said: "In the past, when people were in the fields, their hearts were at home, and the adults' hearts were torn in half. This time, with the nursery, adults can work in the fields with peace of mind." Yin Zhu Bu Chi said: "The comrades take care of our children, cleaning up their poop and pee, making them rosy and fat. We couldn't have dreamed of such a thing in the past." Li Xia's mother, A Ya, expressed endless gratitude to the nursery. She is a poor woman without a husband, relying entirely on her own labor to make a living. In the past, when she went to the fields, she always put Li Xia on the edge of the field, but she was afraid that she would fall or be bitten by insects. Therefore, A Ya was often unable to work with peace of mind, cutting a few bundles of highland barley in the field and then going to check on her child. Since Li Xia went to the nursery, A Ya has been able to help others with the harvest with peace of mind, regardless of wind or rain. In twenty days, she earned ten loads of grain. She said happily: "The grain earned this year is not only enough to get through the winter, but I can also sell some to make a set of clothes for Li Xia."
    Although the Luhuo busy farming season nursery was only run for twenty days, it left an indelible impression on the working women here. We believe that in the near future, more busy farming season nurseries will appear on the Kang Tibetan Plateau.

    在康藏高原上
    中央民族卫生工作队队员　曲青莲
    新生命的诞生
    一个雪后初晴的日子——我们中央民族卫生工作队在罗科马牧区开诊的第三天，太阳快落山了，门诊病人也渐渐少起来了。这时，突然有人在喊：
    “曲同志，快点来！快点来！”当我急步跨入妇科检查室时，一个妇女正对翻译同志说：“我感到很不舒服，快请你们的女门巴（医生）给我检查一下，看是什么病。”检查结果，确定她快临产了。
    这个妇女名叫该洛锦，是一个四十岁上下的牧民。对于她来说，这一次还是初产呢。她的家不在这里，而门诊室又是喇嘛寺的房子，按照藏民的习惯，是不允许女人在喇嘛寺里生孩子的，这怎么办呢？妇幼组的同志便有点着急起来了。她们只好扶着产妇，提着接生箱，向附近山坡上一间暗黑无光的茅屋走去。房主是一个八十多岁的老妈妈，她从来没见过在屋子里生孩子，更没有经历过一个生人在自己家里生孩子。但是，这位老妈妈看到我们对产妇是那样的关切，心里受了感动，终于答应把屋子借给我们。
    天黑了。天气变得很坏，外面风夹着雪呼呼地吹着。屋子里，产妇时时发出痛苦的呻吟。这时，一个五十多岁的老婆婆敲门借宿。一进门看见有人要在屋里生孩子，便嚷起来：“快出去，到草坝子上去。在屋里生孩子要出事的。”还没有等到我们解释，老妈妈已善意地对她说：“面风雪很大，就让她在屋子里生吧，卫生队的同志亲自守在这里，不会出事的。”
    午夜时候了。该洛锦由于子宫的加速收缩，感到很痛楚，连我们的话也不听了。她把灯吹熄了，把灶坑里的一点火苗也扑灭了。大家以一种焦虑的心情在黑漆漆的屋子里守着。大约夜半三点多钟的时候，产妇开始安静下来。这是一种临产的先兆。我们赶快打亮了手电筒，让产妇躺下。在她还没有躺好的时候，我们听到“哇哇”一声，一个新生命诞生了。我们就在手电的照射下，进行一切产后料理。
    刚刚天亮，我们就把孩子放在该洛锦的身旁。该洛锦抚摸着孩子，脸上闪动着慈母的微笑。她感激地对我们说：“在反动派统治时期，生孩子的妇女往往要被撵出去的，谁也不管你的死活。今天，你们却为我耐心地守了一夜，什么事都亲自做，一点都不嫌脏，又用你们的衣服给我包孩子。在我发脾气的时候，你们一点也不生气……”她用手比划着说：“格才老！格才老（谢谢的意思）！”两个老妈妈也异口同声地说：“格才老，毛主席牙母牙母的（太好了的意思）。”
    十天以后，该洛锦听了我们的劝告，抱着孩子来种牛痘。孩子没有名字，我们给他起了一个名字叫“新生”。该洛锦高兴地用藏语喊着“新生，新生”。
    孩子们的乐园
    在炉霍县，天气渐渐凉起来了，藏民正忙着秋收。每天拂晓的时候，街上便传来一阵阵的说笑声。虽然我们不能完全听懂这些语言，但是近几天来的经验告诉我们，藏民们要下田割青稞去了。来卫生队看病的人渐渐少了，我们便趁着这个时候开始了
    一件新的工作。
    在这样一个大丰收的季节里，藏族妇女一方面要下田收割青稞，一方面又要照管孩子；因此，她们感到非常苦恼，心里发愁。有的把小孩子交给大一点的孩子照看；有的给孩子灌一点酒，让他醉呼呼地睡去；有的索性把孩子背出去放在田坎上，任凭日晒风吹。遇到阴天下雨，妈妈们因为疼爱孩子，只好留在家里照看他们。民主妇女联合会和卫生队妇幼组同志了解到这种情况，便商议试办一个农忙托儿所。由于妇女小组的帮助，我们借到了两间土屋、一个小院子；托儿所便成立了。民主妇女联合会和卫生队妇幼组的同志分担了保育工作。孩子们在这些“阿姨”（即保育员）的关怀下开始了新的幸福生活。每天早晨，“阿姨”们把孩子们的脸和手洗得干干净净。到吃饭的时候，让小孩子喝着热呼呼的牛奶，大一些的孩子就吃酥油糌粑。他们吃饱了，有的便安安静静地睡觉，有的呀呀学语，有的在院子里敲着小鼓、小锣，唱歌、做游戏。他们再也不像过去那样滚得满身是泥了。
    托儿所变成了孩子们的乐园。一岁多的力霞，虽然在开始时她妈妈没有给她报名，但是她每天天还没有大亮就跑到托儿所来了。在院子里，她不停地跑来跑去，呀呀地喊着，人们猜不透她心里有多么快活。
    按预定日期，托儿所的工作应该结束了，但是因为有些老乡的秋收工作还没做完，托儿所的工作只得延长五天。在托儿所工作正式结束的那天，我们召开了一个母亲会。会上，母亲们都感激得不知说什么好。高季英说：“以前人在田里心在家，大人的心都撕成两半了。这次有了托儿所，大人都能安心下地去劳动了。”银珠不赤说：“同志们一把屎一把尿，把我们的孩子带得又红又胖，这样的事情，过去是作梦也想不到的。”力霞的妈妈阿雅对托儿所更表示了无限的感激。她是一个没有丈夫的穷苦妇女，全凭自己劳动度日。过去，她下地时总是把力霞放在田坎上，但又怕她摔着，又怕她被虫咬着。因此，阿雅常常放不下心来工作，一会儿在田里割几束青稞，一会儿又去看看自己的孩子。自从力霞到托儿所以后，阿雅不管刮风下雨，都能安心地去帮人收割了。二十天中，她赚了十筒粮食。她高兴地说：“今年赚的粮食不但够过冬，还可以卖出一点，给力霞做一身衣服。”
    炉霍农忙托儿所虽然只办了二十天，但它在这里的劳动妇女中留下了不可磨灭的印象。我们相信，在不久的将来，康藏高原上将会出现更多的农忙托儿所。
