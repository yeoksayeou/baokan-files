The theoretical study of cadres in Wuhan City began comprehensively on September 15, 1952. 17,434 cadres participated in the theoretical study, including 163 in the advanced group, 1,709 in the intermediate group, and 15,562 in the primary group.

The advanced group's study is led by the Municipal Party Committee Study Group. The Municipal Party Committee Study Group meets every two weeks, with responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee giving special reports to guide the study.

The intermediate group's study is centered on the Marxist-Leninist Night School run by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, with 688 students, accounting for 40% of the intermediate-level cadres. These students are all active participants in the study, and some of them serve as theoretical instructors and study guides for the primary groups.

The Marxist-Leninist Night School holds classes once a week, for two hours each time. Before class, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department issues study outlines to help cadres prepare. After class, discussion topics are assigned, and reference books are designated for branch leaders to conduct discussions and self-study. Every two weeks, a "classroom discussion" is held at the district party committee or directly subordinate organs' party committees. Each person first writes a speech outline, and then speakers are temporarily designated during the discussion. This type of discussion plays a significant role in urging cadres to study on their own. Problems that cannot be resolved in the discussion are brought to the Marxist-Leninist Night School for lecturers to answer uniformly.

The primary group's study is led by the amateur political schools run separately by the district party committees and directly subordinate organs' party committees. Currently, there are sixteen political schools in the city, with 6,942 students, accounting for 44% of all primary group students. They are all active participants in the study, party member cadres, and study guides (tutors) for the primary groups. The political school holds classes once a week. After attending class, the students return to their respective organs and study together with comrades in the primary group, playing a backbone and leading role.

The theoretical guidance on relevant theoretical issues for each grade of theoretical study for cadres in Wuhan City is provided by responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee for the advanced group, nine lecturers from the Central South Lecturer Group (who also serve as teachers at the Marxist-Leninist Night School) for the intermediate group, and theoretical instructors and study guides (tutors) for the primary group. These theoretical instructors and study guides (tutors) were selected in July and August 1952. There are now 189 theoretical instructors, with an average of 15 in each district party committee (directly subordinate organs' party committee). There are 1,080 study guides (tutors), with an average of about one guide (tutor) for every fifteen cadres in the primary group participating in theoretical study.

I. How Theoretical Instructors and Study Guides are Selected

Over the past three years in Wuhan City, through various movements and organized theoretical studies, especially the test of the "Three-Anti" movement, the political and theoretical level of cadres has improved to a certain extent, especially the large number of activists who emerged during the movements, who urgently demand progress. It is entirely possible to organize and cultivate them, and select a group of theoretical instructors and study guides from among them. In 1951, 174 study guides were selected, and they played a certain role in promoting learning. This was the foundation before Wuhan City selected theoretical instructors and study guides.

In order to further grasp the situation and create experience, the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee selected the Municipal Grain Company, an organ with a certain theoretical and cultural level of cadres in the city, to conduct a pilot selection. The selection work began at the end of June 1952. After a series of work such as understanding the situation, studying the conditions, repeated comparisons, determining the objects, and soliciting opinions, one theoretical instructor was selected from the original three study guides, and seven new study guides (tutors) were developed, accounting for 7% of the cadres participating in theoretical study, with an average of one guide (tutor) for every fourteen people.

The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department summarized the experience of the Municipal Grain Company in selecting theoretical instructors and study guides, and issued a notice on July 24, 1952, instructing all organs in the city to carry out the selection of theoretical instructors and study guides. The notice determined the conditions, stipulated the controlled numbers for selection, and the selection procedures. The selection task was completed successively from August 10th to 20th, resulting in the selection of 189 theoretical instructors and 1,080 study guides (tutors).

Selecting theoretical instructors and study guides is based on the cadres' cultural, theoretical, and political level, and starting from the requirements of the work and the cadres' existing level. This is the fundamental link in doing a good job of selection. Among the one theoretical instructor and nine study guides (tutors) (including the original two) selected by the Municipal Grain Company, the conditions possessed by the theoretical instructor Li Shaoyun are: 1. Party member; 2. Cultural level equivalent to high school; 3. Studied Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution, with basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism; 4. Gave Party lectures, able to write general theoretical articles; 5. Active in work and study, with prestige among the masses. The conditions for the nine study guides (tutors) are: 1. Party member (tutors are members of the Communist Youth League); 2. Junior or senior high school cultural level; 3. Possess political and theoretical knowledge, with two people graduating from the Marxist-Leninist Night School; 4. Active in work and study, with a certain understanding ability. Therefore, among the study backbones they selected, they met the conditions and did not deviate from the current level of cadres by making excessive demands. Among the theoretical instructors in the city, 169 have basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, accounting for 89% of the total. Among the study guides (tutors), 935 have basic knowledge of political theory, accounting for more than 86% of the total. The above figures show that more than 85% of the theoretical instructors and study guides (tutors) selected in the city meet the conditions. In the selection process, one unit once understood the conditions too high, feeling that no one could be a theoretical instructor except for senior responsible comrades. Therefore, they felt that they could not select a theoretical instructor. However, after clearly understanding the conditions and understanding the situation, they selected eleven theoretical instructors and 161 study guides (tutors). In the selection process, a few units also had the phenomenon of emphasizing politics and neglecting culture and theoretical level in grasping the conditions. For example, among the 22 tutors selected by a tax sub-bureau in a certain district, three later participated in cultural studies; another had only studied in a private school for nine years and had not well studied basic theoretical knowledge such as A Brief History of Social Development, New Democracy, and the History of the CCP, but was decided to be a study tutor simply because he was more active in the "Three-Anti" movement and in his usual work. Such prominent examples are, of course, only individual cases. In a few organs, due to neglecting the role of cultural and theoretical level in guiding theoretical study and not comprehensively grasping the conditions from all aspects of cultural, theoretical, and political level, there is still a phenomenon that some of the study backbones selected in the organ cannot be competent. This must be resolved.

In the selection process, Wuhan City adopted a method combining leadership and the masses, which is another important link in doing a good job in selecting theoretical instructors and study guides. The steps are: first, the branch studies and determines the list, then organizes mass discussions, then the branch makes a decision, and reports to the party committee for approval. To adopt this selection method, the party committee must attach importance to leadership, announce the conditions to the masses, and make the conditions grasped by the masses, otherwise it will become a formality. The advantages of this method: (1) It enables cadres to further improve their study requirements in the selection process and recognize the importance of selecting study backbones for carrying out theoretical study; (2) It can inspire study guides (tutors) to enhance their sense of responsibility and closely connect with the masses; (3) It can further help the leadership correctly grasp the conditions for selection. After this selection work, the enthusiasm of cadres in Wuhan City for theoretical study became even higher, and theoretical instructors and study guides felt a great responsibility and actively carried out their work. However, some units neither announced the conditions to the masses nor explained the work tasks to the tutors (guides) themselves and obtained their consent in the selection, but simply designated them by the branch. Therefore, some study guides (tutors) did not attach importance to this work after being selected because they did not know their tasks, and the masses did not deeply feel the need for guides because they did not understand the work they should undertake.

II. The Important Issue Lies in the Leadership and Cultivation of the Party Committee

The quality of the theoretical instructor's work depends on the leadership and cultivation of the party committee. After the completion of the selection of theoretical instructors in Wuhan City, the Municipal Party Committee immediately ran an amateur political school on August 20, 1952, and opened a "Lecture on Political Common Sense", concentrating the city's theoretical instructors for training, with 700 trainees including study guides. The purpose of the lecture was to help theoretical instructors prepare lessons, prepare lecture outlines, and study teaching methods. The lecture was held three times a week, two hours each time, and ended on September 10. On September 15th, the city's sixteen amateur political schools successively opened classes, and this group of theoretical instructors undertook the task of teaching the "Reader of Political Common Sense".

The usual teaching work of theoretical instructors is mainly controlled by the propaganda department of the district party committee or directly subordinate organs' party committee. Taking Jianghan District as an example, there are 17 theoretical instructors there. According to the nature of the instructors' work and theoretical level, eight lecture groups were established to undertake the eight chapters of the "Reader of Political Common Sense". For example, the theoretical instructor of the People's Court lectures on the state system, and the theoretical instructor of the party committee lectures on the nature and purpose of the Party, etc. After the main lecturer of each chapter is determined, the work of the district party committee propaganda department is: (1) to organize theoretical instructors to study according to the lecture outline issued by the Municipal Party Committee; (2) to provide reference books; (3) to introduce the level and requirements of the students to the theoretical instructors; (4) to review the lecture outline.

In order to ensure the quality of lectures, five days before lecturing on a certain chapter, members of the lecture group lecturing on the chapter and members of the lecture group lecturing on the next chapter are convened to jointly study the teaching content of the upcoming lecturer and determine the main lecturer of the next chapter. This not only exchanged lesson preparation experience and enriched the teaching content, but also played a role in "linking the preceding and the following" for the next chapter, ensuring the systematicness of the lectures.

The Jianghan District Committee leads the work of theoretical instructors in this way, from the three main links of organizing lesson preparation, reviewing lecture outlines and exchanging teaching experience. Therefore, it directly helps the work of the instructors, solves the difficulties in teaching, and guides the study of cadres.

When theoretical instructors in Wuhan City began to participate in teaching work, although many party committees also did some work, the issue of how to lead theoretical instructors has not yet been clearly resolved. Many propaganda ministers of party committees have not personally grasped the work of theoretical instructors and have not personally reviewed the lecture outlines of theoretical instructors. Therefore, theoretical instructors inevitably have shortcomings in their teaching work. When lecturing on the first chapter of the "Reader of Political Common Sense", more than half of the theoretical instructors of amateur political schools had the phenomenon of not lecturing well to varying degrees. Some read the book because they did not prepare lessons sufficiently; some lacked teaching experience, and although they prepared a lot of materials, they could not grasp the center and briefly explain the problems; and some even made mistakes in their lectures. As a result, many students felt that listening to the lectures was not as good as reading the book themselves, and some problems could not be solved by reading the book themselves, so they felt distressed and affected their learning mood.

In general, most theoretical instructors are active and responsible for the work they undertake. They regard lecturing as a glorious task entrusted to them by the Party, actively search for materials, repeatedly study the problems, and solicit the opinions of comrades. Many comrades stay up late to prepare for courses. However, due to the lack of help and training from some leaders, the lack of lecturing experience of theoretical instructors, and the fact that they are all part-time and have busy administrative work, it is inevitable that the courses are not fully prepared, so the shortcomings of not lecturing very well temporarily are inevitable, but this can be overcome. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department held a forum for theoretical instructors on September 29th and 30th, 1952, to exchange experiences, study lessons, and specifically pointed out the key points of lecturing on chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the "Reader of Political Common Sense". More importantly, through this meeting, the leadership methods of the Party Committee Propaganda Department to theoretical instructors were further stipulated, which are: First, the Party Committee Propaganda Department must seriously review the lecture outline; second, the theoretical instructors must be organized into mutual aid groups according to the lecture unit, and collectively study the lecture problems under the guidance of the Party Committee Propaganda Department; third, organize observation and let theoretical instructors listen to each other's lectures in order to absorb experience; fourth, after lecturing on each unit, organize a forum for instructors to exchange teaching experience; fifth, often collect students' reflections on the lectures to help theoretical instructors improve their teaching work. After this meeting, the party committee strengthened the leadership of the work of theoretical instructors, and the teaching effectiveness was also improved. The "Lecture on Political Common Sense" held by the Municipal Party Committee to train theoretical instructors played a certain role in improving the teaching level, but because the time was short, in-depth research could not be carried out on teaching content and teaching methods. Therefore, theoretical instructors did not get the due improvement in these aspects, and difficulties occurred in subsequent teaching. How to adhere to the method of "training while teaching" to solve the problem of training theoretical instructors in peacetime work is a problem worthy of attention.

They are now preparing to further solve the problems of theoretical instructors and study guides in the intermediate group, and solve the work tasks and methods of study guides in the primary group, and how the branch leads the guides to tutor cadres to study on their own and carry out work. The learning mood of cadres in Wuhan City is high and enthusiastic. How to learn better in order to achieve greater results is a problem that the party committee needs to pay attention to and solve in its leadership.

    中共武汉市委对于理论教员、学习指导员的选拔和领导
    翟定一
    武汉市在职干部理论学习，是在一九五二年九月十五日全面展开的。参加理论学习的干部有一万七千四百三十四人，其中高级组一百六十三人，中级组一千七百零九人，初级组一万五千五百六十二人。
    高级组由市委学习会领导学习。市委学习会每两周举行一次，由市委负责同志作专题报告指导学习。
    中级组以市委宣传部举办的马克思列宁主义夜校为核心进行学习，学员共六百八十八人，占中级组干部百分之四十。这些学员都是学习中的积极分子，其中有一部分人担任初级组的理论教员与学习指导员。
    马克思列宁主义夜校每周上课一次，每次两小时，课前由市委宣传部印发学习提纲，帮助干部进行预习；课后出讨论题，指定参考书，由支部领导进行讨论与自修；每两周并以区委或机关分党委为单位举行一次“课堂讨论”，每人先写好发言提纲，讨论中临时指定发言人。这种讨论会在督促干部自修方面，起了很大的作用。在讨论中解决不了的问题，则提到马克思列宁主义夜校，由讲师统一解答。
    初级组的学习是由各个区委、直属机关各分党委分别主办的业余政治学校进行领导。现在，全市政治学校共有十六处，学员六千九百四十二人，占全部初级组学员百分之四十四，都是学习中的积极分子、党员干部和初级组的学习指导员（辅导员）。政治学校每周上课一次，学员听课后回到本机关与初级组的同志共同学习，起骨干和带头作用。
    武汉市在职干部理论学习各学级的有关理论问题方面的指导，高级组由市委负责同志担任，中级组由中南讲师团九位讲师（兼任马克思列宁主义夜校的教员）担任，初级组则由理论教员与学习指导员（辅导员）担任。这些理论教员与学习指导员（辅导员）是一九五二年七、八月间选拔的，现已有理论教员一百八十九人，平均每个区委（机关分党委）有十五人。学习指导员（辅导员）一千零八十人，平均约每十五个参加理论学习初级组的干部有指导员
    （辅导员）一人。
    一　理论教员与学习指导员是怎样选拔的
    武汉市三年多来经过各种运动的锻炼和历次有组织的理论学习，特别是“三反”运动的考验，干部的政治水平、理论水平都有了一定程度的提高，尤其是运动中涌现的大批积极分子，他们迫切要求进步。把他们组织起来加以培养，并在其中选拔一批理论教员与学习指导员是完全可能的。一九五一年已经选拔了学习指导员一百七十四人，他们对开展学习都曾经起了一定的作用。这是武汉市选拔理论教员与学习指导员前的基础。
    为了进一步掌握情况，创造经验，中共武汉市委宣传部选择了在全市范围内干部具有一定的理论、文化水平的机关——市粮食公司，进行了选拔的试点工作。选拔工作在一九五二年六月底开始，经过了摸情况、研究条件、反复比较、确定对象和征询意见等一系列的工作后，在原来的三个学习指导员中选拔出理论教员一人，新发展学习指导员（辅导员）七人，占参加理论学习的干部的百分之七，平均每十四人有指导员（辅导员）一人。
    市委宣传部总结了市粮食公司选拔理论教员和学习指导员的经验，于一九五二年七月二十四日发出通知，指示全市各机关进行理论教员与学习指导员的选拔工作；通知中确定了条件，规定了选拔的控制数字和选拔手续。到八月十日至二十日已先后完成了选拔的任务，结果选拔出理论教员一百八十九人，学习指导员（辅导员）一千零八十人。
    选拔理论教员与学习指导员是根据干部的文化、理论、政治水平，并从工作要求及干部现有水平出发来掌握，这是作好选拔工作的根本环节。市粮食公司在其所选拔的理论教员一人、学习指导员（辅导员）九人（包括原有二人）中，理论教员李少云所具备的条件是：一、党员；二、文化程度相当于高中；三、学习过中国革命基本问题，具有马克思列宁主义基本知识；四、讲过党课，能写一般性的理论文章；五、工作学习积极，在群众中有威信。九个学习指导员（辅导员）的条件是：一、党员
    （辅导员是团员）；二、初中或高中文化水平；三、具备政治理论知识，有两个人在马克思列宁主义夜校毕业；四、工作、学习积极，有一定理解能力。因此，在他们所选的学习骨干中既符合了条件，又没有脱离目前干部的水平而作过高的要求。全市理论教员具备马克思列宁主义基本知识的有一百六十九人，占总数的百分之八十九；学习指导员
    （辅导员）具备政治理论基本知识的有九百三十五人，占总数的百分之八十六强。上述数字说明，全市所选拔的理论教员与学习指导员（辅导员）百分之八十五以上是符合条件的。在选拔过程中某一单位曾经把条件理解得太高，觉得理论教员的工作，除高级负责同志外，便无人可当，因此便感到选不出理论教员来。但经明确地认识条件、摸清情况后，便选拔出十一个理论教员和一百六十一个学习指导员（辅导员）。在选拔过程中，也有少数单位，在掌握条件的问题上，曾经发生过重政治，轻文化、理论水平的现象，如某区税务分局在其所选的二十二个辅导员中，有三人以后参加了文化学习；另有一人只读过九年私塾，连社会发展简史、新民主主义和中共党史等基本理论知识均未很好学过，只是由于他在“三反”运动中和平时工作中比较积极，便被决定为学习辅导员。像这样突出的例子，当然只是个别的。在少数机关中由于忽视了文化、理论水平对指导理论学习的作用，没有全面的从文化、理论、政治水平各方面去掌握条件，因而本机关内所选拔的学习骨干中还有一部分不能胜任的现象，这是必须加以解决的。
    在选拔过程中，武汉市采用了领导与群众相结合的方法，这又是作好选拔理论教员和学习指导员工作的另一个重要环节。其步骤是先由支部研究确定名单，然后组织群众讨论，再由支部决定，报请党委批准。采用这个选拔方法，必须党委重视领导，向群众宣布条件，并使条件为群众所掌握，不然便会形成走过场。这一方法的好处：（一）是使干部能在选拔的过程中，进一步提高学习的要求，认识选拔学习骨干对开展理论学习的重要意义；（二）是能启发学习指导员（辅导员）增强工作的责任心，密切联系群众；（三）可以进一步地帮助领导上正确掌握选拔的条件。经过这一选拔工作后，武汉市干部的理论学习热情更加高涨，理论教员和学习指导员深感责任重大，而积极地进行工作。但有些单位在选拔中既未向群众宣布条件，也没有向指导员（辅导员）本人讲清工作任务和取得他们的同意，只简单地由支部指定，因此，有些学习指导员（辅导员）选拔出来后因不知道自己的任务而不重视这一工作，群众也因不了解他们所应担负的工作，而没有深切地感到指导员的需要。
    二　重要的问题在于党委的领导和培养
    理论教员工作的好坏，决定于党委的领导和培养。在武汉市理论教员的选拔工作结束后，市委即于一九五二年八月二十日举办业余政治学校，开设了一个“政治常识讲座”，集中了全市理论教员进行训练，受训者连学习指导员共七百人。讲座的目的是帮助理论教员备课，准备讲授提纲，研究教学方法。讲座每星期上课三次，每次两小时，于九月十日结束。九月十五日全市十六处业余政治学校先后开课，这一批理论教员便分担了讲授“政治常识读本”的任务。
    理论教员平时的教学工作，主要是由区委或机关分党委宣传部掌握，以江汉区为例，那里共有理论教员十七人，他们根据教员的工作性质、理论水平，成立了八个讲授小组，分担“政治常识读本”八章课程；如人民法院的理论教员讲国家制度，党委的理论教员讲党的性质、目的等。每章主讲人确定后，区委宣传部的工作就是：（一）根据市委所发讲授提纲组织理论教员进行研究；（二）供给参考书；（三）向理论教员介绍学员的水平和要求；
    （四）审查讲授提纲。
    为了保证讲课的质量，在讲某章课前五天召集讲授该章的讲授小组和讲授下一章的讲授小组的成员，共同研究即将讲课的主讲人的教学内容，并决定下章的主讲人。这样，既交流了备课经验，充实了教课内容，同时，对下章也起了“承上启下”的作用，保证了讲课的系统性。
    江汉区委就是这样从组织备课、审查讲授提纲与交流教学经验三个主要环节来领导理论教员进行工作的；因而，便直接帮助了教员的工作，解决了教学中的困难，对干部的学习起了指导作用。
    武汉市理论教员在开始参加教学工作时，许多党委虽然也作了些工作，但对如何领导理论教员的问题，还没有得到明确解决。许多党委的宣传部长还没亲自掌握理论教员的工作，还没有亲自审查理论教员的讲授提纲，因此，理论教员在教学工作中就难免产生缺点。在讲授“政治常识读本”第一章时，半数以上的业余政治学校的理论教员都曾在不同程度上发生过讲不好的现象；有的因备课不充分，讲课成了念书；有的因教学经验缺乏，虽然准备了一大堆材料，但却不能抓住中心，扼要地说明问题；更有个别的在讲课中发生错误，这样便使许多学员觉得听课不如自己看书，而看书又有一些问题自己解决不了，于是感到苦恼，影响了学习情绪。
    总的说来，理论教员对其所担负的工作，大多数都是积极负责的，他们把讲课视为党交给自己的光荣任务，他们积极地找材料，反复研究问题，征求同志们的意见；不少同志为了准备课程，直到深夜不眠。然而，由于有的领导上的帮助和培养不够，理论教员讲课经验缺乏，又都是兼职，行政工作繁忙，以致课程准备不充分，因此，暂时讲得不很好的缺点是难免的，但这是可以克服的。市委宣传部便针对着这些情况，于一九五二年九月二十九、三十两日召开了理论教员座谈会，交流了经验，研究了教训，具体地指出了“政治常识读本”一、二、三、四章的讲课要点。而更重要的是通过了这次会议，进一步地规定了党委宣传部对理论教员的领导方法，这就是：第一、党委宣传部必须认真审查讲课提纲；第二、必须将理论教员按讲课单元组成互助小组，在党委宣传部指导下集体研究讲课问题；第三、组织观摩，让理论教员互相听课，以便吸取经验；第四、在讲完每一单元后，组织教员座谈会，交流教学经验；第五、经常搜集学员对讲课的反映，帮助理论教员改进教学工作。经过这次会议，党委加强了对理论教员的工作的领导，教学效能也提高了。市委举办的培养理论教员的“政治常识讲座”，对提高教学水平，起了一定的作用，但因时间短，在教学内容和教学方法上均未能进行深入的研究，因此理论教员在这些方面，也就没有得到应有的提高，而在以后教学中发生困难。如何坚持“边训边教”的办法，以解决平时在工作中对理论教员的培养问题，这是值得重视的问题。
    他们现在正着手准备进一步地解决中级组的理论教员与学习指导员的问题，解决初级组学习指导员的工作任务、工作方法及支部如何领导指导员辅导干部自学和进行工作等问题。武汉市干部的学习情绪是高涨而热烈的，怎样才能学得更好，以收到更大的成果，这是党委在领导上需要加以重视和解决的问题。
