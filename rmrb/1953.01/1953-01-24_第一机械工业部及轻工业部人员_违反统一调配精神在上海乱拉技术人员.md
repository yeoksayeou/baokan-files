Personnel from the Central First Ministry of Machine Building and the Central Ministry of Light Industry, in the course of preparing to establish design institutions and strengthen design forces in the Shanghai area, have violated the spirit of the State Council Financial and Economic Committee's directive on unified recruitment of construction personnel. They are only considering the interests of their own units, disregarding organizational procedures, and arbitrarily recruiting people through personal connections and high salaries, which has increased the chaotic situation in the organization of design personnel in the Shanghai area.

In mid-November of last year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government instructed the Financial and Economic Committees of major administrative regions and relevant departments that construction personnel in the Shanghai area should be recruited uniformly by the East China Construction Engineering Department (now renamed the East China Construction Engineering Bureau). Other regions and central departments requiring personnel should apply for allocation through the Central Financial and Economic Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and should not mobilize personnel on their own. In order to implement this instruction, the East China Construction Engineering Department has, since December of last year, been mobilizing through the Shanghai Architects Association, organizing over a hundred architects who have closed their businesses, or who have not closed but are willing and whose employers have agreed, to study in order to enhance their understanding of large-scale economic construction and gradually absorb them into state-owned enterprises. However, some departments have violated the above spirit and indiscriminately recruited construction personnel. For example, the East China design department of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building, in order to strengthen its design force at the end of last year, recruited architects from private enterprises through the personal connections of the ministry's engineer Cai Hui. He visited private Xinzhong Architectural Firm's Diao Guohua and other architects for negotiations as many as seven times. Since Diao Guohua and others had already been absorbed by the East China Construction Engineering Department's Design Company, he resorted to unscrupulous means, attempting to lure Diao Guohua and others over with conditions such as "increased treatment" and "no transfer out of Shanghai for two years." Later, through the efforts of the East China Construction Engineering Department's Design Company, he failed to do so. At the same time, the ministry's East China design department sent people to contact architect Liao Jiafu and others, who had already reported to the East China Construction Engineering Department's Design Company, in the same way. Lured by conditions such as high salaries, Liao Jiafu wavered and considered leaving the East China Construction Engineering Department's Design Company.

In order to prepare for the establishment of a design department in the Shanghai area, the Central Ministry of Light Industry also hired technical personnel everywhere, luring away architects Xi Fuquan, Huang Yuanji, and others who had already agreed to join the East China Construction Engineering Department's Design Company, and asking Xi Fuquan and others to assist in recruiting thirty to fifty technical personnel to strengthen the ministry's design force in Shanghai.

Similar phenomena are still occurring, causing great difficulties for the organization of design personnel in the Shanghai area. The Central First Ministry of Machine Building and the Central Ministry of Light Industry must immediately find ways to correct this phenomenon.

    第一机械工业部及轻工业部人员
    违反统一调配精神在上海乱拉技术人员
    中央第一机械工业部、中央轻工业部等在筹建上海地区设计机构和加强设计力量的工作中，违反政务院财政经济委员会统一吸收建筑人员的指示精神，只顾本单位利益，不通过组织手续，用私人感情及高额工资等手段任意拉人，增加了上海地区设计人员组织工作中的混乱现象。
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会在去年十一月中旬曾向各大行政区财政经济委员会及有关部门指示：上海地区建筑人员由华东建筑工程部（现已改为华东建筑工程局）统一吸收，其他地区与中央各部门如需要人员可通过中央财政经济委员会与上海市人民政府申请分配，不得自行动员。华东建筑工程部为执行这一指示，从去年十二月起，即通过上海建筑师同业公会进行动员，把已经歇业的，和虽未歇业但本人自愿又经该企业主人同意的百余位建筑师组织起来学习，以提高他们对大规模经济建设的认识，陆续吸收他们参加国营企业工作。但若干部门却违反上述精神，乱拉建筑人员。如中央第一机械工业部华东设计部门，去年年底为了加强设计力量，曾通过该部工程师蔡恢的私人关系，招揽私营企业建筑师。他先后走访私营新中建筑事务所刁国华等建筑师洽谈达七次之多。因刁国华等当时已为华东建筑工程部设计公司所吸收，他竟不择手段企图以“提高待遇”、“两年不调出上海”等条件，将刁国华等拉过去；后经华东建筑工程部设计公司争取，没有拉去。同时，该部华东设计部门派人用同样方式与业已向华东建筑工程部设计公司报到的建筑师廖嘉福等接洽，致廖嘉福在高额工资等条件的引诱下，发生动摇，有离开华东建筑工程部设计公司的打算。
    中央轻工业部为了筹建上海地区的设计部门，也到处聘请技术人员，把原已同意参加华东建筑工程部设计公司的奚福泉、黄元吉等建筑师拉过去，并要奚福泉等协助吸收三、五十名技术人员充实该部在上海的设计力量。
    类如上述的现象还在继续发生，这给上海地区设计人员组织工作造成很大困难。中央第一机械工业部和中央轻工业部等必须立即设法纠正这种现象。
