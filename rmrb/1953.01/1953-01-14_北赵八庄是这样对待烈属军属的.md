This is How Beizhao Bazhuang Treats Families of Martyrs and Soldiers
Li Wen

The Hearts of the Entire Village are with the Families of Soldiers

On December 4th of last year, the people of Beizhao Bazhuang, a model village for preferential treatment in Shenze County, Hebei Province, decided in a discussion: starting from the 6th, a village-wide manure collection campaign would be carried out within three days. On the first day of the manure collection campaign, all men and women in the village were required to collect soil to make fertilizer for the families of martyrs and soldiers who lacked labor, to ensure increased production for the families of martyrs and soldiers in 1953.

The weather on December 6th of last year was particularly cold. It was originally said that they would start after breakfast, but as soon as the sun showed its red face, the propagandist broadcast from the roof: "Wang Laotao has fired the first shot, starting his cart early, and is now pulling the second cart of soil to the home of Wang Chenxin, a military family." Wang Laotao is a forty-year-old peasant who turned over a new leaf and is the leader of a production mutual aid group. Their mutual aid group had discussed and agreed the day before that all three of their carts would be fully mobilized the next day. Wang Laotao and the young lad Wang Jisheng teamed up to drive one cart. At night, Wang Laotao added two more scoops of feed, and the livestock were already full. Before the east turned white, he woke up Wang Jisheng, who was sleeping soundly, and hitched up the cart to go to the fields. The two used hoes to dig up the frozen clods of soil, loaded the cart full, and by the time they drove the cart to the front of the military family Wang Chenxin's door, it was already bright. When they drove their cart back into the village entrance, they ran into branch secretary Jiao Qiu, who said, "Laotao is really good, setting a model role!" Jisheng blurted out, "This is our second trip." Wang Laotao said shyly, "This is nothing to be a model for. Collecting fertilizer for the families of soldiers, getting up a little earlier and pulling one more trip is one more trip!"

The sun slowly rose from the east, painting a layer of gold on the ridges of every farmer's house. People had already eaten breakfast early. The sound of shouting at livestock and a large number of vehicles mobilizing. Youth League members with white towels tied around their heads, young women wearing green jackets and red trousers, carrying baskets and shoulder poles, walked out of their homes. Some people thought the baskets and shoulder poles were not efficient, so they pushed out small red carts.

Beizhao Bazhuang became as lively as a festival. On the streets, fifteen bright flags with slogans like "Model for Preferential Treatment, Pioneer of the Masses," "Patriotic丰产 Village [Patriotic Abundant Harvest Village]," and "Tax Collection Model Village" fluttered in the wind. These flags of honor inspired the people's enthusiasm for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families.

On one side of the road, large carts with small red flags attached, one after another, left the village from the east end of the street, with the words "Collecting Fertilizer for Glorious Military Families" written on the flags; on the other side, carts loaded with soil clods returned to the village one after another. Those carrying baskets, carrying poles, and pushing small carts shuttled back and forth. Suddenly, eight or nine people pulled a cart full of soil over, and many people cheered for a young man "harnessing" in the middle: "Jiao Xuezi is really great!" This reminded the members of the propaganda team, they gave the small cart to others, found a spare large cart, and equipped themselves. At the crossroads, two human-pulled carts met, and both sides deliberately quickened their pace to challenge each other, shouting: "Jiao Xuezi group, add oil!" "Propaganda team, add oil!"

I met Jiao Xuezi and his group when they were loading soil in a large pit in the east of the village. In the cold weather, Xuezi was only wearing a single cloth shirt, and his body was steaming. I couldn't help but say, "Young man, you must be exhausted!" Before Xuezi could speak, a member of the mutual aid group interrupted and said, "Xuezi is really capable, nicknamed 'Black General,' can eat and do. Eats seven or eight pancakes in one meal, and when he starts working, he's worth two people. In the fall, Xuezi watered the land for military family Liu Xiangtai, working on the well platform in the dark, watering until the east was bright, watering all night." Xuezi smiled shyly when he was praised, and said, "The propaganda team is our village's model. Whether it's production, road repair, grain tax collection, weeding and pest control in the fields of military families, they are always in the lead. This summer, the propaganda team members used the 'siesta' time to bring their own tobacco leaves and water to treat aphids in the cotton fields of military families, and won the village's model flag. However, this time, our mutual aid group will surpass them in collecting fertilizer for military families!" Speaking of this, Xuezi told me about the meeting they had last night: there were six small donkeys in the group, none of which could be harnessed, and the only livestock that could be harnessed happened to be sick. They all felt that it was not efficient to carry soil for military families in baskets. After a while of pondering, several people simply used people to pull the cart, so they could pull more soil. Xuezi volunteered to "harness", he said: "I am strong and healthy, there will be no mishaps!" As he spoke, a cart of soil was already loaded. Xuezi jumped to the front of the cart in one stride, stood in the "harnessing" place, the cart strap on his shoulders, his arms raised the cart handles, eight or nine people shouted, and forcibly pulled a cart of soil from the bottom of the pit.

The hearts of the entire village are with the families of soldiers, and everyone wants to do their part for the families of soldiers. Several old men who could not carry baskets or shoulder poles were using iron spades to shovel the large bumps on the road near the crossroads. They wanted to repair the road, so that each cart could load more soil. The elderly woman Di Cuizhu also mingled in the crowd, moving her small feet, silently carrying soil for the families of soldiers. The old man Wang Lianxiang was sixty-eight years old and had carried soil for most of the day. In the afternoon, people persuaded him: "You are so old, take a rest!" He said, "It's okay, I can carry it!" This old man, who had long exceeded the age for substitute farming, carried more than forty baskets of soil for the families of soldiers in one day. The hunchbacked Wang Ruichen said to Jiao Xuezi, "I can't help you load soil, I also want to do something for the families of soldiers, let me keep accounts for you!" He conscientiously took on this responsibility. He stood on the side of the road, pointing out which military family this cart of soil should be pulled to, and how many carts of soil that military family already had.

In the afternoon, the village became even more lively. Eighty or ninety primary school students also came to participate in carrying soil. The older children carried soil from the pit on the edge of the village to their homes, and the younger ones carried the soil piled in front of the homes of martyrs and soldiers to the pigpens. The children ran back and forth, sweating profusely with tension.

All this is such a great comfort to the families of martyrs and soldiers! The seventy-five-year-old martyr's family member Jiao Lao Hui, leaning on his crutches, walked out of his house and sat on the stone roller by the street, watching the people transporting soil back and forth with kindness. Military family member Aunt Liu Xiangtai boiled water and let Jiao Xuezi and his group drink water, "We are not thirsty! The days are short now, can't delay the work!" The young men answered while unloading the soil, and after unloading the soil, they pulled up the empty cart, rattling, a group of people like a gust of wind went back to the fields.

Families of Soldiers First, Ourselves Second

In every production season, whether it is deep plowing in early spring, weeding, harvesting wheat, or controlling cotton aphids in summer, or planting wheat and autumn plowing, the people of Beizhao Bazhuang always do the work of the families of martyrs and soldiers first. "Families of Soldiers First, Ourselves Second" has become a habit, or rather a social fashion, among the villagers of this village.

When the superiors called for patriotic increase in production, the members of Jiao Junjiang's substitute farming group first thought of the land of martyr's family Wang Zhenfeng. Wang Zhenfeng's son died in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The group members discussed: The Japanese devils burned more than three hundred houses and killed more than thirty people in our village in one sweeping up. What kind of years were those? There were Japanese blockhouses on the edge of the village, and we watched the weeds grow in the fields, not daring to go home to cultivate the land; now we live and work in peace and contentment, and these good days were exchanged for the blood of the sons of the martyrs, we must achieve丰产 for the martyrs, first to satisfy the martyrs, and second to help the country take care of them. The group members discussed and agreed to designate one mu and four fen of paddy fields as丰产 land, and according to the old lady's opinion, they planned to produce 500 jin of grain per mu (the annual output is 300 jin). The group members plowed this piece of paddy field four times and harrowed it six times; when the rice seedlings grew out, they fixed the seedlings twice; they weeded it three times and irrigated it nine times. Last autumn, the dry land was dry, and more than eighty mu of land depended on one well, which could not be irrigated during the day, so it was irrigated at night. They had been irrigating all night for three consecutive nights. The group members' sweat did not flow in vain, and one mu and four fen of land actually harvested 1,210 jin of grain, with an average yield of 864 jin per mu, exceeding the original planned output by 72.8%, exceeding the local general output by more than double. Created the highest record of丰产 grain in the village.

After the Lunar New Year, substitute farming group leader Jiao Weizi led all the group members to the home of military family Liu Xiangtai to discuss the production plan for the whole year. Liu Xiangtai said:
"There are no other difficulties, except that my piece of land is high on one end and low on the other, and more than three mu of land out of eight mu cannot be irrigated." The substitute farming group members said, "Don't worry, we will take the trouble to repair your land!" As soon as the land thawed, before their own work had started, Jiao Weizi led five or six substitute farming group members to repair the terrain in Liu Xiangtai's field. It was relatively simple to remove a layer of soil from the high places and fill it in the low places, but Jiao Weizi and the others did not do this. Jiao Weizi said: "We must cherish the 'living soil' (the layer of soil on the surface, which is soft and fertile after years of cultivation, is called living soil) in the fields of military families, pile up the 'living soil', remove a layer of dead soil from the high places and fill it in the low places, and then spread the 'living soil' flat. We will spend more effort, and the military families can harvest more grain." The group members also felt that only in this way could they live up to the soldiers in the front. A few days later, Jiao Weizi happily said to Liu Xiangtai, "Go to the field to see, aunt, the land has been repaired." At this time, the people were brewing to buy pigs, and Jiao Weizi also persuaded Liu Xiangtai to buy a pig. He said: "If you buy a pig and build a pigpen, we will take the time to pull a few carts of soil for you, so you can accumulate some manure for the land." Liu Xiangtai said, "It's good, but I don't have any money now!" So Jiao Weizi lent Liu Xiangtai the money he had prepared to buy a pig. Before spring plowing, he accumulated more than a dozen large carts of manure for Xiangtai's family. Because all of Liu Xiangtai's eight and a half mu of land had become paddy fields, and with sufficient fertilizer, the output in 1952 more than doubled compared to 1951. In 1951, the average yield of grain per mu in Liu Xiangtai's family was 233 jin, which increased to 514 jin in 1952.

When it was time to sow cotton by taking advantage of the soil moisture, the cotton seeds of the military family Wang Chenxin were damaged during soaking. Substitute farming group leader Hao Shouba first planted his own cotton seeds for Wang Chenxin's family. Substitute farming team member Wang Xiaoliu used livestock to cultivate the land for the military families during the day, and at night he let his son and daughter pull the cultivator to cultivate his own land... After the autumn harvest in 1952, the county inspection team conducted a household-by-household inspection in this village. A total of thirty-one families of martyrs and soldiers enjoying substitute farming planted 70.05 mu of cotton, producing 12,680 jin of cotton, with an average yield of 179 jin per mu, an increase of 59 jin per mu compared to 1951; a total of 268 mu of grain was planted, producing 117,565 jin of grain, with an average yield of 401 jin per mu, an increase of 133 jin per mu compared to 1951.

Caring About the Daily Life of Military Families

The substitute farming group members not only contract to cultivate the land of martyrs and soldiers, guaranteeing output; they also often care about solving the difficulties in the daily life of martyrs and soldiers. When the work in the fields is not busy, Hao Shouba's substitute farming group first repaired the courtyard for the military family Wang Chenxin and built a pigpen. They also asked her if she had any other difficulties. She said: "I want to build a kitchen shed. It's very inconvenient to live and cook in the same room, especially in the hot weather." The substitute farming group members agreed to make five hundred bricks for Wang Chenxin and built the kitchen shed before wheat harvest. Martyr Jiao Lao Hui is a seventy-five-year-old man with sores on both legs. These sores are particularly dirty and smelly in hot weather. Di Cuizhu of the substitute farming group did not mind the dirt or the smell, and patiently washed the sores and applied medicine for the old man every day, finally curing the sores. When Wang Pangchen was carrying water for Jiao Lao Da Ye, he saw that the old man had difficulty getting up when he defecated in the toilet, so he put a small stool in the toilet and erected a wooden stake in front of the stool. The old man could grab the wooden stake to get up without feeling strenuous. Jiao Lao Da Ye said: "In the old society, disobedient children would not listen to the instructions of the elderly. The masses in our village treat me with all their hearts, thinking of everything, big and small!"

Better Than Every Year

The winter wheat sowing for the families of martyrs and soldiers in 1952 was completed one day earlier than the masses in the whole village. The idle land of the families of martyrs and soldiers has been winter plowed twice. Some time ago, there was a light rain, and after the rain, some substitute farming groups harrowed the land of the military families again. Every military family has jointly dug a well with others, and every family has pigs and pigpens. This means that the conditions for increased production for the families of martyrs and soldiers in 1953 are even better than in 1952.

Last year, each substitute farming group had already formulated a substitute farming increase production plan for 1953. The night before I left this village, youth substitute farming group leader Jiao Junjiang gave me a piece of paper with his group's substitute farming plan for 1953 written on it. The plan stated the group's efforts: the grain yield per mu will increase by 77 jin compared to 1952; the cotton yield per mu will increase by 80 jin; the plan for one and a half mu of wheat is to harvest 350 jin, an increase of 90 jin per mu compared to the normal output. The plan also specifies in detail the methods to achieve the increase in production in 1953. For example, the wheat fields will be fertilized three times, and the one and a half mu of wheat land has been applied with 140 jin of bean cake and ten carts of manure as base fertilizer; the substitute farming group will accumulate another twenty carts of manure for this piece of land, once in the winter of 1952 and once in the spring of 1953 (using ten carts of manure, 45 jin of bean cake) as top dressing. Weed the seedlings twice and irrigate five times. At that time, I carefully calculated the fertilizer they used to guarantee the increase in production. In addition to what has already been used in the fields, the substitute farming group still needs to accumulate another 60 carts of manure for the military families in the winter of last year and this spring, and mobilize the military families to buy 340 jin of bean cake. I really had some doubts, and I asked Jiao Junjiang: "Do the military families have the money to buy so much bean cake?" Jiao Junjiang said: "When we started discussing the increase production plan for next year (1953) with the martyr's family Wang Zhenfeng, she was scared when she heard that she had to buy more than 300 jin of bean cake." I reminded her: "Wasn't this year (1952) a丰产 year? An old lady harvested more than 1,200 jin of grain and more than 500 jin of cotton, enough to eat and more, taking out the money for thirty or forty jin of cotton to buy bean cake would be clear." The old lady realized it and said: "Okay! I can afford it." Jiao Junjiang went on to say: "Our lives are rising year by year, and we also guarantee that the lives of the military families will be better than every year."

Jiao Junjiang finally told me a story that happened in the spring of last year (1952): Jiao Weizi's substitute farming group invited the experts from Hezhen and Chenzhuang to dig a well for the military family Liu Xiangtai. According to rural custom, the experts who go down the well must eat well. However, this time, the experts who went down the well heard that the well was being dug for the use of military families and took the initiative to propose: "We want the military families to save a little bit. It's enough to eat sorghum and corn pancakes!" The seven experts spent eight days repairing the well and installing the waterwheel. According to the general market price, it would cost at least 800,000 yuan in wages, but the experts who went down the well only charged 150,000 yuan. They said: "Working for military families is different from general work, it's enough to earn some pocket money!"

    北赵八庄是这样对待烈属军属的
    力文
    全村人的心向着军属
    去年十二月四日，河北省深泽县优抚模范村北赵八庄群众讨论决定：从六日开始，在三天内进行全村性的积肥运动。积肥运动的第一天，要求全村男女给缺少劳力的烈属军属积土造肥，保证烈属军属一九五三年增产。
    去年十二月六日天气格外冷。原说是早饭以后才动手，可是太阳刚一露红，宣传员便在屋顶广播了：“王老涛打响了第一炮，提前出车，现在已经在给军属王趁心家拉第二车土啦。”王老涛是一个四十多岁的翻身农民，生产互助组的组长。他们的互助组在头一天便商量好，全组三套车第二天完全出动。王老涛和年青小伙子王济生伙赶一辆车。夜里，王老涛多加了两勺料，牲口早就吃饱了。东方才发白，他就喊醒正睡得呼呼的王济生，套车下地了。两个人用镢头挖起冰冻的土块，装上满满一车，把车赶到军属王趁心门前的时候，天才大亮。当他俩赶着车又走进村口的时候，碰着支部书记焦秋来了，秋来说：“老涛真行，起模范作用啦！”济生口快，他说：“咱这是第二趟车了。”王老涛靦覥地说：“这算不了啥模范，给军属积肥，早起一会，多拉一趟是一趟！”
    太阳慢慢从东方升起，给每个农家的房脊抹上一层金色。人们已早早吃罢饭了。一片吆喝牲口的声音，大批的车辆出动了。头上扎着白毛巾的青年团员，穿着绿袄红裤的年轻妇女，背着筐，担着挑子，走出家来了。有人嫌筐和挑子不得劲，推着小红车出来了。
    北赵八庄像节日一样的热闹起来了。大街上，“优抚模范，群众先锋”“爱国丰产村”“税征模范村”……十五面鲜艳的旗帜迎风飘扬。这些荣誉的旗帜鼓舞着人们拥军优属的热情。
    路的一边，插着小红旗的大车一辆挨一辆地从街东头出村了，旗上写着“给光荣军属积肥”的字样；另一边，一辆又一辆满载土块的车返村了。背筐的，担挑的，推小车的，穿梭似的来来往往。忽然，八九个人拉着满满一车土过来，许多人向中间“驾辕”的一个年轻小伙子喝起采来：“焦雪子真棒啊！”这一下提醒了宣传队的队员们，他们把小车让给别人，找到一辆空闲的大车，也装备起来。在十字街头，两辆人拉大车碰头了，双方都故意加快脚步，向对方挑战，高喊着：“焦雪子组加油啊！”“宣传队加油啊！”
    焦雪子一帮人正在村东头大坑里装土的时候，我遇到了他们。寒冷的天气，雪子只穿着一件单布衫，身上直往外冒热气。我忍不住说：“小伙子累得够呛啊！”没等雪子开口，旁边一个互助组组员插嘴说：“人家雪子真能干，外号叫‘黑将军’，能吃能做。吃饼子一顿七八个，干起活来一个顶俩。秋天，雪子给军属刘香台浇地，搭黑上井台，一气浇到东方亮，一浇一整宿。”雪子见人夸奖他，不好意思地笑了笑，说：“人家宣传队是俺村的模范。不论是生产、修路、征公粮，给军属地里锄草、治虫，样样走在头里。今年夏天，宣传队队员们利用‘歇晌’时间，自备烟叶水到军属棉花地里治蚜虫，得了村上的模范旗。不过，这次给军属积肥，俺们互助组要赛过他啦！”说到这里，雪子告诉我他们小组昨天晚上开会的情形：组里有六个小毛驴，都驾不起辕来，一头能驾辕的牲口又恰巧生病了。用筐给军属背土吧，都觉得不得劲。几个人琢磨了一会，索性用人拉车，能多拉些土。雪子告奋勇“驾辕”，他说：“我力气大，身体结实，出不了差池！”说着，一车土已经装好了。雪子一个箭步跳到车前，在“驾辕”的地方站定，车鞶搭在肩上，两臂驾起车把，八九个人一声呐喊，硬是把一车土从坑底拉上来了。
    全村人的心都向着军属，人人想为军属尽自己一份力量。背不动筐担不起挑子的几个老汉，在十字街附近用铁铣铲着道上的大圪塔。他们想修平道路，让每辆车多装些土。老年妇女邸萃珠也杂在人群里，拐动两只小脚，不言不语的给军属背土。王连祥老汉六十八岁了，背了大半天土，后晌人们劝他：“这么大年纪了，歇歇吧！”他说：“行，我背得动！”这位早已远远超过代耕年龄的老人，一天里为军属们背了四十多筐土。驼背的王瑞辰对焦雪子说：“我不能帮助你们装土，我也要为军属做点事啊，让我替你们记账吧！”他便认真地担当起这个责任来。他站在路边上，指点着这车土应该拉到那个军属家，那家军属已经有多少车土了。
    午后，村里更热闹了。八九十个小学生也来参加背土。大一些的孩子们从村边大坑里向家背土，小一些的就把烈属军属门前堆的土背到猪圈跟前。孩子们来回跑着，紧张得满头大汗。
    这一切，对烈属军属们是多么大的安慰啊！七十五岁的烈属焦老惠老大爷拄着拐棍走出家来，坐在临街的石滚上，慈爱地看着来往运土的人们。军属刘香台大娘烧好开水，让焦雪子一伙人喝水，“俺们不渴！现时天短，不能耽搁工夫！”小伙子们一面回答，一面卸土，卸完土，拉起空车，咕碌碌的，一群人像一阵风似的又下地了。
    先军属后自己
    北赵八庄人民在每个生产季节，不论是开春时的深耕，夏季的锄草、收麦、治棉蚜，还是种麦、秋耕地，都是尽着烈属军属的活先做。“先军属后自己”，已经成为这个村村民的习惯，或者说是社会风尚了。
    当上级号召爱国增产的时候，焦俊江代耕组的组员们首先想到的是烈属王贞凤的土地。王贞凤的儿子在抗日战争中牺牲了。组员们讨论着：日本鬼子一次扫荡烧了咱村三百多间房，杀死三十多口人。那时是啥年月啊，村边有鬼子的碉堡，眼看着地里长起荒草，不敢回家种地；现时咱安居乐业了，好日子是烈属们的儿子用鲜血换来的，咱一定要给烈属搞丰产，一来让烈属满意，二来也可帮助国家照顾她们。组员们计议好，便去和烈属王贞凤商量。老人家十分高兴地一再说：“咱要少定点产量，免得人家说咱吹气哩！”他们把一亩四分谷地作为丰产地，按照老人家的意见，计划每亩产谷五百斤（常年产量是三百斤）。组员们把这块谷地耕四遍，耙六遍；谷苗长出了，两次定苗；锄了三遍，浇了九水。去秋天旱地干，八十多亩地靠一口井，白天浇不过来，晚上浇。他们曾连着在三个晚上，一浇一个整夜。组员们的汗水没有白流，一亩四分地竟收了一千二百一十斤谷子，每亩平均产量八百六十四斤，超过原计划产量百分之七十二点八，超过当地一般产量的一倍多。创造了全村丰产谷的最高纪录。
    过罢旧历年，代耕组长焦未子便领着全体组员到军属刘香台家里商量全年生产计划了。刘香台说：
    “别的没啥困难，就是俺那块地一头高一头低，八亩多地就有三亩多浇不上水。”代耕组员说：“您放心吧，俺费点功夫，便把您这地修整好啦！”地里刚解冻，自己活还未动手，焦未子就领着五六个代耕组员在刘香台家地里修整地形了。把高处的土起去一层，填在低处，是比较简单的，但焦未子他们没有这样做。焦未子说：“咱们要爱惜军属地里的‘活土’（地面上的一层土，多年耕作，松软肥沃，叫活土），把‘活土’敛成堆，把高处的死土起去一层填低处，然后再用‘活土’铺平，咱们多费点力气，军属能多打粮食。”组员们也都觉得只有这样做才对得起前方的战士。几天以后，焦未子高兴的对刘香台说：“您大婶到地里看看去吧，那块地整好了。”这时，老百姓都在酝酿着买猪，焦未子也劝刘香台买个猪。他说：“您买个猪，垒起猪圈，俺们抽空给你拉几车土，您好歹给地里积攒些粪。”刘香台说：“好是好，我现时还没钱哩！”于是焦未子把自己准备买猪的钱，先借给刘香台买了猪。春耕前便给香台家积了十几大车粪。由于刘香台的八亩半地全部变成了水田，再加上肥料充足，一九五二年的产量较一九五一年增加一倍还多。一九五一年刘香台家每亩地平均产量是谷子二百三十三斤，一九五二年增到五百一十四斤了。
    在趁墒种棉的时候，军属王趁心家在棉籽浸种时浸坏了，代耕组长郝瘦巴把自己的棉籽先给王趁心家耩上。代耕队员王小六，白天用牲口给军属耩地，夜里让他的小子和闺女拉耩子，再耩自家的地……一九五二年秋收后，县检查组在这个村作过一次逐户检查。全村三十一户享受代耕的烈属军属，共种棉花七十亩零五分，产棉一万二千六百八十斤，每亩平均产量一百七十九斤，每亩较一九五一年增产五十九斤；共种谷子二百六十八亩，产谷十一万七千五百六十五斤，每亩平均产量四百零一斤，较一九五一年每亩增产一百三十三斤。
    关心军属日常生活
    代耕组员们不仅包种烈属军属的土地，保证产量；他们还经常关心解决烈属军属日常生活上的困难。在地里活不忙的时候，郝瘦巴代耕组首先给军属王趁心修平了院子，垒好了猪圈。又问她还有什么困难。她说：“我有心盖个饭棚。在一个屋子里又是住又是做饭，到热天很不方便。”代耕组员们一合议，替王趁心打了五百块坯，麦前便把饭棚盖起来了。烈属焦老惠是一位七十五岁的老人，两腿生连疮。这种疮每遇热天，格外脏，还发出强烈的臭味。代耕组的邸萃珠不嫌脏也不嫌臭，每天耐心地给老人洗疮敷药，终于把疮治好了。王胖臣给焦老大爷挑水时，看到老人家在厕所里大便，起立很不方便，他就在厕所里放上一个小板凳，板凳前立一个木桩，老人家用手抓着木桩起身，便不觉费力了。焦老大爷说：“旧社会里，儿女们不孝顺的，也不听老人指使。俺村群众待我够十成，大处小处都想得到！”
    一年比一年强
    一九五二年烈属军属的冬麦播种，比全村群众提前一天完成了。烈属军属的闲地都已冬耕两遍。前些时下了一阵小雨，雨后有些代耕组又把军属的地耙了一遍。每户军属都和别人伙打了水井，每家都有猪有圈。这就是说，一九五三年烈属军属增产的条件比一九五二年更好了。
    去年，各代耕组都已订出一九五三年的代耕增产计划。当我离开这个村的前一天晚上，青年代耕组组长焦俊江交给我一张纸，上面写着他组一九五三年的代耕计划。计划上订着全组的努力目标：谷子每亩较一九五二年增产七十七斤；棉花每亩增产八十斤；亩半麦子计划收三百五十斤，较常年产量每亩增产九十斤。计划上还详细规定着达到一九五三年增产的办法。比如，麦地将采用三次施肥的办法，亩半麦地已用豆饼一百四十斤和十车圈粪施了底肥；代耕组再为这块地积二十车圈粪，一九五二年冬蒙一次圈粪，一九五三年春天上一次追肥（用十车圈粪，四十五斤豆饼）。锄两遍苗，浇五次水。当时我仔细计算了他们保证增产所用的肥料，除了已经用到地里的以外，代耕组在去冬今春还需要再为军属积圈粪六十车，动员军属买三百四十斤豆饼。我真有些怀疑了，我问焦俊江：“军属有钱买这样多豆饼吗？”焦俊江说：“我们开始和烈属王贞凤商量明年（一九五三年）增产计划的时候，她一听要买三百多斤豆饼，就吓住了。”我提醒她：“今年（一九五二年）不是丰收了吗？一个老太太收了一千二百多斤谷子，五百多斤棉花，有吃有余，拿出三四十斤棉花的钱来买豆饼，便用不清啦。”老人家才悟过来，说：“行！我能买得起。”焦俊江接着说：“俺的生活一年比一年上升，俺也保证让军属的生活一年比一年更强。”
    焦俊江最后告诉我一个在去年（一九五二年）春天发生的故事：焦未子代耕组请了河町、陈庄的把式给军属刘香台家打井。乡下的惯例，下井的把式必须吃好饭。可是，这一次下井的把式们听说打井是为军属使用，便主动提出来：“咱们要让军属节省点，高粱、玉米饼子吃饱就行！”七个把式花了八天时间，把井修好，安上水车。按一般市价，至少要付工价八十万元，下井的把式们却只收十五万元。他们说：“为军属干活不同一般，能挣个零花钱就行啦！”
