The study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) by cadres in the North China region began around November 10th of last year. Currently, most regions have completed the study, while a few are still studying the third part of Malenkov's report. After studying Malenkov's report, senior cadres and comrades participating in senior study groups in various regions will continue to study Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

The scale of this study is unprecedented, with incomplete statistics indicating that more than 210,000 people participated; the enthusiasm for studying is very high. The publication of study materials could not keep up with demand. For example, Tianjin originally planned to print 40,000 copies, but even after printing 60,000 copies, it was still not enough. Due to the provinces not being able to print the documents in time, cadres in some counties and districts had to adopt collective reading or rotational reading methods. In terms of study time, some cadres, in addition to studying and discussing during the prescribed study hours, also tried to use their spare time for self-study. After the study began, various regions emphasized report explanations. For example, the North China Bureau and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin invited comrades such as Xiong Fu, Chen Jiakang, and Wang Fei to give reports on the international situation. Liu Xiufeng, Vice Chairman of the North China Administrative Council, Tao Lujia, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, Wu Yannong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and responsible party and government cadres in Hebei also gave one to three reports to the cadres. Senior cadres in various regions have been organized through this study, mostly with the Party Committee Secretary or Deputy Secretary or the Director of the Propaganda Department serving as the group leader or deputy group leader. Two and a half days are set aside each week for concentrated study or discussion, with no excuses for leave allowed. Each discussion designates a main speaker in advance, and the number of discussion meetings held in various regions ranges from three to seven. Some municipal-level cadres have also reported their experiences to general cadres.

Through the study of the international situation, the broad masses of cadres have further understood the two different situations and two different futures of the two major camps; recognized the strength of the peace and democracy camp and the deepening of the economic crisis of capitalism; and strengthened their determination to defend peace. Some comrades said: "In the past, I only abstractly knew that the peace and democracy camp was strong, but I didn't know that its development speed was so astonishing. This time, I realized from reason why imperialism wants war." Some engineering and technical personnel said: "World War II delayed the Soviet Union by nearly two five-year plans. We must defend peace if we want to build."

When studying the second part of Malenkov's report, most departments merged the original levels B and C and discussed their work in light of reality. The industrial departments mainly studied how to reduce waste products, improve quality, improve production efficiency, and examine attitudes towards production plans. This study method has achieved significant results in some cases. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's production used to be "loose at the beginning and tight at the end," and the annual production task was often rushed to be completed in the fourth quarter. This time, after the core group's inspection, it was realized that the main problem was the leadership's thinking. In the past, it was always felt that it didn't matter if the task was not completed in the first half of the year, and that a few new records in the second half of the year would solve the problem. Because of the recognition of the harm of this kind of thinking, the leadership of completing the production plan on a monthly basis has been strengthened, and the 1953 production plan will be reconsidered. In the agricultural sector, the development process of Soviet collective farms and the issues of mutual aid and cooperation in agriculture were also emphasized. Through study, various economic departments have deeply recognized the importance of streamlining and saving and correctly using funds, and have further examined the existing waste. The cultural and educational departments focused on studying how to further improve cultural and educational work. For example, the North China People's Magazine, combined with Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," studied whether to focus on praise or exposure, and clearly recognized the significance of focusing on praising new people and new ideological qualities, and the necessity of advocating satirical works to fight against the decadent and dying. The medical departments studied how to learn Pavlov's theory and promote advanced Soviet experience. Tianjin Third Hospital actually adopted the Soviet "anechoic system" and "beautified ward" experience. In addition, through this study, the broad masses of cadres have understood the development of Soviet society and the state, recognized the importance of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and increased their enthusiasm for learning from advanced Soviet experience.

The third part of the report gave all party members, cadres and leading organs great inspiration. Through this study, they further recognized that the root of the strength and invincibility of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies in the unity and solidarity of the Party ranks and its close ties with the broad masses. They further recognized the importance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and examined themselves in light of reality. Some comrades said, "The CPSU played such a big role in the Patriotic War and national construction, and it is still so serious about shortcomings. How can we improve our awareness if we don't carry out criticism?" They have also gained some experience in issues such as discipline, selecting cadres to conduct in-depth inspection work, and strengthening ideological leadership. Some units in Beijing, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, are preparing to convene party representative meetings to inspect work. Some high-level party leading organs, such as the Shanxi Provincial Committee, have specially studied how to strengthen the Party's inspection work from top to bottom and how to give play to the supervision of party members and the masses from bottom to top.

Due to the poor political common sense and political economy knowledge of some comrades in this study, and the failure of teachers and instructors to play their due role, the study effect in some places was not good, especially the understanding of the economic laws of socialism and the basic prerequisites for the transition from socialism to communism was poor. Therefore, it is still very necessary to explain some basic issues in future studies; as for some professional or technical issues that cannot be resolved in the study, they should be resolved when turning to professional study or technical research, so as not to affect the progress of the entire study plan.

### 华北区干部学习联共代表大会文件有收获  高级干部将学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”

    华北区干部学习联共代表大会文件有收获
    高级干部将学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    华北地区干部学习联共第十九次代表大会文件，于去年十一月十日左右开始。目前，多数地区已经学完，少数地区正在学习马林科夫报告中的第三部分。各地高级干部及参加高级组学习的同志在学习马林科夫报告之后将继续学习斯大林同志著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。
    此次学习规模空前浩大，参加学习的人数据不完全统计约有二十一万多人；学习情绪十分热烈。学习文件的出版赶不上需要，如天津市原计出四万册，但印了六万册仍不敷用。各省因文件赶印不及，有些县区干部不得不采取集体阅读或轮流阅读办法。在学习时间上，有些干部除在规定的学习时间研读讨论外，并尽量利用业余时间自修。学习开始后各地均重视报告讲解，如华北局及北京、天津两市都分别请了熊复、陈家康、王飞等同志作国际形势的报告。华北行政委员会副主任刘秀峰、山西省委书记陶鲁笳、天津市委宣传部长吴砚农及河北党政负责干部也都向干部作了一次至三次报告。各地高级干部，通过此次学习已组织起来，大都由党委正副书记或宣传部长亲任正副组长。每周抽出两个半天时间集中学习或讨论，一律不准请事假；每次讨论事先指定主要发言人，各地开过的讨论会从三次至七次不等，有的市级干部并将心得向一般干部作了报告。
    通过国际形势的学习，广大干部进一步了解了两大阵营的两种情况、两种前途；认识和平民主阵营力量的强大及资本主义的经济危机的加深；加强了保卫和平的斗志。有的同志说：“过去只抽象的知道和平民主阵营力量强大，不知其发展速度这样惊人，这次才从道理上知道了帝国主义为什么要战争。”有些工程技术人员说：“第二次世界大战耽误了苏联将近两个五年计划。我们要建设就必须保卫和平”。
    学习马林科夫报告的第二部分时，多数部门将原来乙、丙两级合并，联系实际讨论自己工作。工业部门主要研究如何减少废品、提高质量、提高生产效率及检查对生产计划的态度等问题。此种学习方法有的已收到显著成效。如石景山钢铁厂，过去的生产“前松后紧”，一年的生产任务往往到第四季度才去突击完成。这次经过核心小组检查才认识到主要是领导思想的毛病，过去总觉得前半年完成完不成不要紧，后半年有几个新纪录就解决问题了。由于认识了这种思想的危害，就加强了按月完成生产计划的领导，并将重新考虑一九五三年的生产计划。在农业部门也着重研究了苏联集体农庄发展过程及目前农业中互助合作的问题。各经济部门经过学习，深刻认识了精简节约及正确利用资金的重要，进一步检查了目前存在的浪费情况。文化教育部门着重研究了如何进一步提高文化教育工作。如华北人民杂志社，结合毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，研究了应该以表扬或以暴露为主的问题，明确地认识了以表扬新型人物新的思想品格为主，和必须提倡讽刺作品向腐朽垂死的东西作斗争的意义。医务部门研究了如何学习巴甫洛夫学说，推广苏联先进经验的问题。天津第三医院实地采用了苏联“无响制度”、“美化病房”的经验。此外，广大干部通过此次学习，都了解了苏联社会和国家的发展状况，认识了国家工业化，农业集体化的重要，提高了学习苏联先进经验的热情。
    报告的第三部分给了所有党员干部及领导机关以极大的启发。通过这一学习，进一步认识了苏联共产党所以有力量和不可战胜的根源，是由于党的队伍的统一团结及其与广大群众的血肉联系。进一步认识了开展批评与自我批评的重要意义，并联系了实际检查自己。有的同志说“联共在卫国战争与国家建设中起了这么大的作用，对缺点还是这样严肃，我们不开展批评提高觉悟如何能行呢？”对于纪律问题、选拔干部深入检查工作、加强思想领导等问题都有所体会。北京市有些单位如石景山钢铁厂、北京电业局并准备召开党代表会议检查工作。有些党的高级领导机关，如山西省委会特别研究了如何自上而下地加强党的检查工作与自下而上地发挥党员群众的监督作用等。
    此次学习由于有些同志的政治常识及政治经济学知识较差，教员辅导员未发挥应有作用，某些地方学习效果不好，特别对社会主义的经济法则，由社会主义过渡到共产主义的基本先决条件理解较差。因此，今后学习中对某些基本问题作讲解依然是十分必要的；至于某些业务问题或技术问题，在学习中不可能解决的，应待转入业务学习或技术研究时解决，以免影响整个学习计划的进行。
