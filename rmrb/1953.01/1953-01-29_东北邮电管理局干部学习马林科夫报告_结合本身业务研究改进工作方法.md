Northeast Daily Report: The Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration conducted in-depth study of the second part of Malenkov's report, "The Internal Situation of the Soviet Union," in conjunction with its own business.

First, the bureau discussed the issue of serving the development of heavy industry. Through discussion, cadres in all units further understood that China must take the path of socialist industrialization starting with the development of heavy industry. The country's large-scale economic construction cannot be "all-encompassing," nor can any department be "large-scale" in everything; rather, there should be a focus on "large-scale." Postal and telecommunications enterprises should obey the overall interests of the country and strive to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction. At the same time, the bureau also criticized some incorrect thoughts existing among some cadres and workers, such as: the idea that the postal and telecommunications department is not a heavy industry and "cannot make a living," and the desire to leave the postal and telecommunications department to engage in industry; also, the idea of simply relying on state investment, without actively exploring the potential of their own enterprises; and some individual cadres believe that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should also engage in "large-scale" construction, hoping to install as many Soviet-style and Czech-style new machines as possible, without improving the equipment utilization rate, improving labor organization, and improving production efficiency on the existing basis.

Secondly, the issue of conservation was discussed. In the discussion, cadres of the bureau realized that large-scale economic construction requires a large amount of funds. Therefore, increasing production, practicing thrift, tapping potential, and reducing costs are important methods for accumulating funds for national industrialization and ensuring the rational use of funds. All state enterprises should practice thrift in all aspects on the basis of completing production plans to accumulate more funds for national construction. They also believe that in postal and telecommunications enterprises, conservation should and can be carried out in many aspects. In the past, the bureau did not pay enough attention to conservation. First of all, some administrative bureaus had the idea of making generous budgets and using them sparingly. For example, the budget for several projects in 1952 reached more than 2 billion yuan, which could be reduced by 500 million yuan after review. Secondly, the utilization rate of equipment was low. The utilization rate of long-distance telephones in some bureaus was only 49.9%; the utilization rate of telephone equipment in Shenyang was only 68.2%. In the past, everyone thought that these situations were due to old machines and poor quality of parts, but the advanced experience of the Machinery Section of the Second Shenyang Telephone Bureau in maintaining automatic machinery proves that some equipment in each bureau still has great potential to be exploited. In addition, there are also wasteful phenomena such as unreasonable labor organization and large administrative expenses in some units. This study has powerfully educated everyone and criticized the erroneous ideas of "the more state investment, the better" and "the less production tasks, the better."

In addition, the study also strengthened the overall concept of the bureau's cadres. For example, when a certain department of the bureau was making this year's basic construction project budget, it actively tried to explore potential in many ways, adhering to the principle of resolutely not building what could be built or not built, and reduced the budget by 3 billion yuan; the bureau's dormitory basic construction project was also reduced from 12,000 square meters to 9,000 square meters; the number of employees originally planned to be increased in 1953 was also reduced by 80%.

In the study, the bureau's cadres also criticized the various conservative ideas shown in the promotion of advanced experience and the purely task-oriented views in the development of business. This has created more favorable conditions for completing production plans in the future.

    东北邮电管理局干部学习马林科夫报告
    结合本身业务研究改进工作方法
    据东北日报讯：东北邮电管理局根据马林科夫报告第二部分“苏联的内部情况”结合本身业务进行了深入的学习。
    首先该局讨论了为发展重工业服务的问题。经过讨论，各单位干部都进一步了解：我国必须走社会主义从发展重工业开始的工业化的道路。国家进行大规模经济建设不能“百废俱兴”，不是任何一个部门都要“大规模”，而是有重点的“大规模”；邮电企业应该服从国家的整体利益，为配合国家大规模经济建设的需要而努力。同时，该局也批判了一些干部和职工中所存在的不正确思想，比如：认为邮电部门不是重工业，“吃不开”，希望脱离邮电部门去搞工业的想法；还有单纯依靠国家投资的思想，不主动积极地去发掘本企业的潜在力；也有个别干部认为邮电部也应当“大规模”建设，希望尽多地安装苏联式、捷克式的新机器，而不从现有基础发挥设备利用率，改善劳动组织，提高生产效率。
    其次是讨论节约问题。该局干部在讨论中认识到：进行大规模经济建设需要大量资金，因此，增加生产、厉行节约、发挥潜力、降低成本，就是积累国家工业化资金和保证资金得到合理运用的重要方法，所有各国家企业均应在完成生产计划的基础上从各方面来厉行节约，为国家建设积累更多资金。他们并认为在邮电企业中，应该而且可以多方面地进行节约。过去，该局不重视节约的现象是相当多的。首先是有些管理局在造预算时，存在宽打窄用的思想，如一九五二年几个工程的预算，曾达二十几亿，经审核后可以减去五亿。其次是设备利用率低，有些局的长途电话利用率只达百分之四十九点九；沈阳市电话设备利用率仅及百分之六十八点二。这些情况，过去大家都认为是机器老旧，机件质量不好，但从沈阳市电话二局机械股创造维护自动机械的先进经验证明：各局有些设备，还有很大的潜力可以发挥。此外，还有些单位有劳动组织不合理，行政开支大等浪费现象存在。经过这次学习有力地教育了大家，批判了“国家投资越多越好”“生产任务越少越好”的错误思想。
    另外，经过学习也加强了该局干部的整体观念。例如该局某处在做今年基本建设工程预算时，主动地想法多方发掘潜力，本着可建可不建者坚决不建的原则，削减了三十亿元的预算；该局宿舍基本建设工程也由一万二千平方公尺减少到九千平方公尺；原计划一九五三年增加的职工人数，也缩减了百分之八十。
    该局干部在学习中也批判了在推广先进经验上表现出来的各色各样的保守思想和在发展业务上的单纯任务观点。为今后完成生产计划创造了更有利的条件。
