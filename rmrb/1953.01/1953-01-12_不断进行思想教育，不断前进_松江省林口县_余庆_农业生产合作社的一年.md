    Continuously Conduct Ideological Education, Continuously Advance
    --The Year of the "Yuqing" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linkou County, Songjiang Province
  　Ding Li Luo Ming
    The peasants of Yuqing Village in Linkou County, since 1948, organized mutual aid teams. After several years of work, production developed, living standards improved, and they increasingly felt that the mutual aid teams could not meet everyone's requirements. Many people felt they were "unable to exert their full strength" to further develop production. By the spring of 1952, they still hadn't figured out a good solution. Some households in difficulty planned to go to the city to find work; a few households with strong manpower and horses felt they couldn't fully utilize their abilities in the mutual aid team and were also preparing to go it alone.
    In February 1952, the work team of the CCP Linkou County Committee discovered this problem in Yuqing Village and returned to the city to discuss it with the County Committee. After ten days or so, the comrades of the work team returned. They explained to the Party members the road to happiness of leading peasants from exchange labor groups to agricultural production cooperatives, and then to collective farms. They also described in detail the nature, management methods, and benefits of agricultural production cooperatives. The Party members felt as if two windows had been opened in their hearts. They unanimously requested the work team to help establish an agricultural production cooperative.
    The Enthusiasm of the Activists Overwhelmed the Cadres
    At this time, the men, women, young, and old in the village were discussing agricultural production cooperatives, whether at meetings, at work, or on the road.
    One evening, the County Committee work team held a mass meeting to discuss the specific methods of joining the cooperative with land and horses; and through detailed accounting, many people realized the benefits of organizing an agricultural production cooperative.
    At this meeting, people who never liked to speak also scrambled to speak. Geng Haijun took the lead and shouted, "Let's sign up to establish a cooperative tonight!" The comrades of the work team wanted everyone to consider it carefully before signing up. Before they could finish speaking, they were drowned out by the voices of the crowd: "No need to consider, we've decided to take this great road!" The comrades of the work team saw that everyone was so enthusiastic, so they agreed. People scrambled to write their names at the front. Qu Shuqin even signed up for her husband, many elderly people signed up for their sons, and Yang Degui signed up for his daughter-in-law. In less than ten minutes, all twenty-eight households in the village had signed up twenty-nine names – because Kang Huimao also signed up for his nephew living in Anle Village. Then, seven people were elected on the spot to form the management committee of the agricultural production cooperative.
    It was past one o'clock in the morning when the meeting ended that night, and the comrades of the work team were very excited and wrote a report to the County Committee overnight.
    A Letter from the Party Committee Sobered the Cadres
    The next afternoon, the work team received an urgent letter from the County Committee:
    "...From the report, we only see the masses' warm welcome to the agricultural production cooperative, and do not see any confused thoughts or specific concerns of the masses about the agricultural production cooperative. Judging from the current level of awareness of the masses in Yuqing Village, it is a fact that the masses warmly request to establish an agricultural production cooperative; however, it is impossible for them to have no concerns at all, nor is it possible to completely solve the confused thoughts in a very short time. Therefore, we must study the various latent thoughts in the masses more deeply and comprehensively; we cannot be satisfied, nor should we only be satisfied with the temporary enthusiasm of the masses. Without solving the problems ideologically, this enthusiasm will not be consolidated, and it will be difficult to clean up in the future. Secondly, taking advantage of the enthusiasm of the masses to stir up a method of signing up for the cooperative at the meeting is also not appropriate enough. The result of doing so will be to bring in some people who have not thought through and still have concerns under the enthusiasm and excitement of the masses, which may be the factor of collapse in the future. Therefore, when signing up for the cooperative, the masses must be given sufficient time to consider, and the principle of voluntariness must be repeatedly emphasized. ..."
    The County Committee's letter shocked the comrades of the work team. But at that time, they were still holding back, thinking that even if the masses had ideological problems, they would not be so serious as to become a "factor of collapse." They took out the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee on establishing production cooperatives to carefully read again. After discussing it again, they realized that: those who were signed up for at the meeting on behalf of them could not be said to be voluntary; especially those who lived in other villages, they had not even received the minimum education on establishing an agricultural production cooperative, let alone being voluntary.
    Therefore, they convened a meeting of Party members and activists that night. The problem was immediately exposed. According to everyone's report: among those who signed up in the village, nearly half of them had very complex motives and ideological situations for joining the cooperative. For example, as soon as Ma Zhenyu heard that an agricultural production cooperative was to be established, he said: "They all say that it will be communist in the future, now it's here! There will be food to eat even if you don't work!" Jin Yu'an didn't want to sign up. He felt that he could "show his talents" outside; if he joined the cooperative, the livestock and land would "not necessarily belong to anyone." However, he was afraid that people would say he was backward if he didn't join the cooperative, so he bit the bullet and signed up for his son. After signing up, everyone else was talking and laughing, but he couldn't even eat his dinner when he went back.
    The ideological problems of the masses were more complex and serious than the work team had originally estimated.
    What to do? At the beginning, everyone came up with three methods: one was to advise those who were not yet voluntary to withdraw from the cooperative and organize mutual aid teams separately; one was to dissolve and reorganize and re-deliberate; and one was to stay in the cooperative and educate slowly. After discussion, in order to truly achieve complete voluntariness, the second method was adopted: re-deliberate, and then sign up to establish the cooperative.
    After announcing the re-registration based on the principle of voluntariness, the ideological problems of the people became more obvious. The work team and the Party members and cadres repeatedly educated them. On the one hand, they explained the policy of voluntary participation in the cooperative; on the other hand, based on the specific conditions of the village's land, labor, etc., they calculated carefully with the masses to calculate how much income would be after joining the cooperative. Everyone personally participated in the calculation: the income of a laborer after joining the cooperative would be twice as much as the income of a middle peasant in the exchange labor group. In this way, those who originally did not believe that they could earn more believed it. However, on the evening before the second registration, Jin Chenghai asked the activist Wang Dehai: "I believe that the income will be more; but can so much really be distributed in the end? Who dares to guarantee?" Hearing Wang Dehai say "Dare to guarantee," Jin Chenghai made up his mind, "Let's go in and try it first."
    After repeated deliberation, the agricultural production cooperative was reorganized on March 19. After this series of twists and turns, the work team and the cadres of Yuqing Village began to sober up.
    The Old Method Doesn't Work
    Three days after the establishment of the cooperative, the production plan was finalized, and they immediately began to deliver manure, and then planted wheat.
    At that time, the entire agricultural production was specifically responsible for by the first deputy director Wang Dehai, and all human and animal power and production tools were under his unified allocation. In order to facilitate meetings, the east and west sides were simply divided into two groups based on the crossroads, and two group leaders were appointed. It seemed that the leadership was well prepared: the production groups were divided, what to plant on that piece of land was also designated, and the seeds were also exchanged; so, sowing began.
    When planting wheat, no matter how much land there was, six plows were always together. Only half a *xiang* of wheat field was left on the south slope, but six plows went to work together. It was finished in a while, and everyone turned from the south slope to the north ridge. More than twenty people were walking and it was quite lively; however, after everyone walked this trip, it was calculated that four or five *gong* were wasted.

    After working for two or three days, the deputy director Wang Dehai was "confused." Mixing seeds needed people, planting wheat needed people, delivering manure and planing stubble also needed people. More than thirty laborers had to be assigned work once a day. The cadres of the management committee held meetings in the middle of the night every day to allocate work. After the meeting, the deputy director had to notify each member door to door. In a few days, Wang Dehai's eyes were bloodshot. He often didn't even have time to eat. Sometimes the meeting ended late at night, so he had to arrange the work for each member the next morning; when everyone went to the field, the sun was already quite high. Sometimes, because the allocation of work was not clear, some people couldn't find work, and some people were left out. Also, because of the temporary allocation of work, the members were not prepared in advance, so they grabbed agricultural tools randomly when they went to the field. Some people didn't bring furniture to the field, so they sat on the edge of the field and basked in the sun. Those who had not completely resolved their ideological problems when they joined the cooperative took this opportunity to "stall."
    This serious chaos, wasted work, and uneven busyness and leisure shook the minds of many members. Ren Huaizhi, who was active in labor, proposed: "Planning stubble is ten points, loafing is also ten points, not working is still ten points, I won't do it anymore!" Geng Haijun and other activists were so anxious that they kept mumbling: "Isn't this over?" Jin Chenghai and Zhai Changjiang saw this situation and said nothing, saying behind their backs: "Let's do it, it won't end well anyway!"
    A New Method Was Found
    In the eleven days of planting wheat, a total of more than one hundred and eighty *gong* were wasted. Party members and activists felt that the problem was very serious. At the end of the spring plowing, the Party group held a meeting, and non-Party activists were also invited to participate. Everyone agreed that the main problem was that the leading cadres used the old methods of leading the mutual aid team to lead the agricultural production cooperative, and the scale was too large to allocate.
    How to lead without wasting work and being able to give fuller play to the superiority of the cooperative? Cadres and all members discussed for three or four days with the help of the County Committee work team and decided to implement a system of fixed quality, quantity, time, and division of labor responsibility: allocate workdays to groups according to work needs, set the amount of work, working hours, and work quality according to conditions, and the group is ultimately responsible for the output. Organizationally, the two production groups were reorganized according to the strength of manpower and animal power. Based on the specific situation, activists and the two deputy directors were assigned to the two groups. Then, according to the strength and land conditions of the two groups, the cultivation area was divided. At the spring plowing mobilization meeting, a patriotic bumper harvest red flag competition was launched.
    At the beginning of spring plowing, a new atmosphere immediately appeared throughout the community. Everyone gathered before the bell rang to go to the fields. Some people followed two plows when sowing. One day, Wang Zheming was hugging stubble, and when the rake broke, he hugged it with his hands. In order to achieve the quota, the two production groups automatically reduced one hour of nap time and automatically mobilized twelve women who had never participated in agricultural production labor to participate in spring plowing.
    In the spring plowing, in order to effectively implement the quota management system, timely supply production tools, seeds, and manure, and enable the production groups to produce according to the quota, a guarantee contract system (the management committee and each production group sign a quota guarantee contract), an inspection system, and labor discipline were further established. Each group elected a quota inspection member to specifically inspect the implementation of the quota.
    The Selfishness Was Criticized
    The production enthusiasm of the members was generally improved, and both groups automatically increased the production quota. However, in the red flag competition, selfishness emerged. This group, in order to win the red flag, only took care of the convenience of the group's production, regardless of whether the other group and the work of the whole community were affected. Some members even hoped that the other group would do badly in order to show themselves. At the beginning of spring plowing, the community bought three new *耲耙*. The first group immediately pushed the old *耲耙* (which could be used after repairing) to the second group and asked to give them all three new ones. When the community repaired the cowshed, it needed four *gong*. Each group was asked to draw two people, and there were people available at that time, but the group leader Wang Diange refused to draw people because he was afraid of falling behind in the competition. Later, when cleaning up the paddy fields, it needed three *gong*. At that time, the first group had relatively abundant manpower, but they said: "Regardless of whether we are busy or not, we are the same group, so we have to send people." At the most serious time, the two groups didn't speak when they met while working.
    The leading cadres broke away from the original circle of bureaucracy and quickly discovered this problem. First, they criticized the selfishness of "each cares for each other" among Party members at the Party group meeting. Then, they held a meeting of members, led by Party members and cadres to examine themselves. Everyone understood that if one group did not do well, the income of the whole group would be reduced, and everyone would have a share. Only when everyone is of one mind can the crops be taken care of well and the income can be more. At that time, many people took the initiative to examine their thoughts and behaviors of only caring about themselves and realized that it was too inappropriate.
    After this meeting, the collectivist thinking of the members was generally improved. On the last day of planting wheat, the first group had eight *mu* that could not be finished. After the second group finished planting their millet, without rest, the whole group, including people and horses, went to the land of the first group and helped to finish planting in one go. Ren Huaizhi, a member of the first group, happily said: "Now we are really one family!" Not long after, the first group finished planting millet first, and then went to help the second group.
    It was still these people who did so much work
    On May 13, 1952, the entire spring plowing ended half a month earlier than in 1951. This had never happened before. In order to educate everyone, a general meeting of all members was held to summarize the spring plowing. After everyone listened to the summary report of Director Sun Wenhai, they couldn't believe it. So much work was done by the same manpower and animal power as in 1951.
    Not only was the sowing time earlier and shorter than in 1951 by half a month to a month, but the quality of cultivated land and the amount of fertilizer applied also exceeded those of 1951. In 1951, less than 18% of the total cultivated land was fertilized. In 1952, it reached 100%. The land was planted more carefully and timely than in 1951. From planting wheat to the end of spring plowing, in just fifty days, the same manpower and animal power as in 1951 were used to do two thousand three hundred and thirteen *gong* more work than in 1951.
    As soon as Director Sun Wenhai finished his report, the whole venue burst into an uproar. Everyone scrambled to tell their inner thoughts. Those who originally did not believe that the agricultural production cooperative could do well now said: Let alone going it alone, even in the mutual aid team, you can't do so much work! Jin Chenghai and Zhai Changjiang (both old middle peasants) didn't have a smile all spring, but they also changed their appearance at the summary meeting that day.
    Still "Not Confident"
    After summarizing the spring plowing competition and awarding the models in the spring plowing, the summer hoeing patriotic bumper harvest red flag competition was launched, and the production enthusiasm of the members was even higher than during spring plowing. However, some members began to feel that they were "too tired" in the agricultural production cooperative. Wang Chengde said: "The cooperative is good, but the work is tight, the discipline is tight, and the meetings are tight. It's really a bit unbearable." Sun Wenzeng was over fifty years old and was elected as a management committee member of the agricultural production cooperative. He was very happy and didn't rest for a day. However, after the summer hoeing competition was launched, he also felt: "How long will this work last? Who knows what it will be like at that time?" He asked not to be a cadre. The "radical" Zhang Fuzeng saw that the agricultural production cooperative was good and advocated: "Next year, don't eat rent for livestock and land, hand them over to the community, and have collectivization!" Ma Zhenyu, who joined the community with the idea of "eating a big pile," saw that the crops of the agricultural production cooperative were growing well, so he kept mumbling: "The crops of the agricultural production cooperative are really good, it doesn't matter whether you work or not, I'll get a share in the fall anyway." During the entire spring plowing stage, he only worked for fourteen days in more than forty days. Zhang Huaijing also said: "I don't want to be rich and noble, I'll get a share anyway when the time comes!" Jin Chenghai, Zhai Changjiang and other old middle peasants, although they changed their original negative attitude after the spring plowing summary; they were still not confident about what point they would reach in the future. Hearing what Zhang Fuzeng, Ma Zhenyu and others said, they panicked again.
    Party members Li Yaode, Liu Wanchun and others were still buried in their work, setting an example for the masses. But they didn't know how to solve the ideological concerns of the masses. They only knew that the future socialist communist society was very good, but they didn't know exactly how good it was themselves.
    The Power of Communist Education
    In order to make everyone see the happy future and establish confidence in advancing, during the summer hoeing period, the leading cadres used the time every night to educate the members, focusing on "The direction in which the Communist Party leads the Chinese people," "The benefits of communist society," and "To realize communist society as soon as possible, we must work together to run the agricultural production cooperative well." After finishing a lesson, the groups held discussions. These topics attracted all the members. Wang Dehou, Liu Kejing, and others, who never attended meetings in the past, also rushed to listen. Although some elderly people could not come to listen, when their family members went back after listening, they often asked until midnight.
    Sun Wenzeng was asking not to be a cadre, and after listening to the lecture, his heart became clear. He thought: There are thousands of benefits of communism. If you want to live that kind of life, you can't get there anytime if you don't work hard now. He said at the discussion meeting: "Working hard now is for a good life. I don't ask not to do it anymore. I must run the agricultural production cooperative well." Ma Zhenyu, who didn't work, also took the initiative to examine himself at the general discussion meeting after hearing that no one would have food to eat if they didn't work in the future. Zhang Huaijing, who "doesn't want to be rich and noble and works neither ahead nor behind," also cheered up after hearing about the good life in communism at that time.
    The Harvest Further Educated All Members
    Although many educations had been conducted and the thinking of most members had gradually improved, the thinking of some members was still fluctuating. Many people said: "It is true that the agricultural production cooperative saves labor and produces live, but I don't know how to distribute the grain in the fall."
    The crops ripened. This was the first bumper harvest in Yuqing Village. The wheat that had been harvested and part of the millet had been distributed to everyone according to the original distribution method. Those who were still wavering in their thoughts and were skeptical about the agricultural production cooperative began to feel at ease. They made self-criticism. Hu Changhai, who did not join the community, regretted saying: "I took the wrong step. I must join the community next year."
    The autumn harvest was just around National Day. In order to welcome National Day, the members cut meticulously, guaranteeing "no grain is lost, do a good job in the autumn harvest." When the 50-year-old member Sun Wenzeng was harvesting sorghum, because it was dark, he dropped a few sorghum ears and did not pick them up. The next morning, he ran to the field early and picked them up one by one. They created a streamlined harvesting method in which cutting, bundling, and stacking were each the responsibility of a person and interconnected. Using this method, the community saved forty-two *gong* just by harvesting millet. They cut all the fields in less than twenty days, seven days earlier than in previous years.
    The output of their various crops greatly exceeded that of 1951. Wheat yielded two thousand four hundred and fifty *jin* per *xiang*, an increase of 250% compared with 1951; soybeans yielded three thousand five hundred *jin* per *xiang*, an increase of 150% compared with 1951; rice increased by 112%; millet increased by 74%; and corn increased by 33%. The community's more than one hundred and forty *xiang* of fields harvested a total of seven hundred and eleven thousand five hundred and ninety *jin* of standard grain. Including side-business income such as pulling feet and logging, the community's total income in 1952 totaled more than seven hundred and fifty thousand five hundred *jin* of grain. After deducting land rent, livestock rent, public grain, horse feed, cart work, seeds, public accumulation fund, and all other expenses, a net of three hundred and ninety thousand *jin* of grain was left, and each labor force could be divided into thirteen thousand *jin*, or more than twenty *shi*, which was twice as much as the average income of each labor force in 1951 (excluding the income of land and livestock).
    Still Need To Do Better
    With the bumper harvest, the masses further believed in the benefits of the cooperative, strengthened their collective concept and patriotism. Whether in labor, at meetings, or in individual conversations, members could be heard happily saying at any time and anywhere: The bumper harvest is thanks to the agricultural production cooperative, the collective strength is great! If it were in previous years, we would be exhausted, and Yuqing Village's mountain slope would not grow such good crops! They are not satisfied and demand to do better. When discussing the use of their grain, many members said in unison: "Buy new agricultural tools, buy good horses." Jin Chenghai said: "We can't eat and drink a lot after we beat down the grain. Now our foundation is still empty, so we should focus on improving production first." Jiang Hongchen and Yao Xiuzhen both said: Although our lives are better now, we are still far from the collective farms in the Soviet Union. We will first run the agricultural production cooperative well, and then head towards the collective farm, which will be even better at that time.

    不断进行思想教育，不断前进
    ——松江省林口县“余庆”农业生产合作社的一年
  　丁力　罗溟
    林口县余庆屯的农民们，从一九四八年起组织互助组，干了几年，生产发展了，生活提高了，越来越感到互助组不能满足大家的要求了，许多人觉得再发展生产就有些“使不上劲”了。到了一九五二年春天，他们还没有想出好办法。一部分困难户打算到城里找活去；几户人强马壮的，觉得在互助组里施展不开，也准备单干了。
    一九五二年二月间，中共林口县委的工作组在余庆屯发现了这个问题，就回到城里去和县委研究。过了十来天，工作组的同志们回来了。他们向党员们讲明白了领导农民从换工组逐步提高到农业生产合作社，然后走到集体农庄的通往幸福的道路，又详细介绍了农业生产合作社的性质、经营方式和好处。党员的心里像打开了两扇窗子一样。他们一致要求工作组帮助建立农业生产合作社。
    积极分子的热情冲昏了干部们的头脑
    这时候，屯子里的男女老少，不管是开会、干活、走路，都在议论农业生产合作社。
    一个晚上，县委工作组召开了群众大会，讨论了土地、马匹入社的具体办法；又通过算细账的方式，使许多人认识了组织农业生产合作社的好处。
    这次会上，从来不爱说话的人也抢着发言了。耿海君领头喊了起来：“今晚就报名成立合作社吧！”工作组的同志要大家好好考虑一下再报名。他们的话没有说完，就被大家的声音盖下去了：“不用考虑啦，这条大道算走定啦！”工作组的同志们看见大伙儿劲头这么足，也就同意了。人们争着把自己的名字写在前边。曲淑琴还替丈夫报了名，许多老年人给儿子报了名，杨德贵替媳妇报了名。不到十分钟的工夫，全屯二十八户，就报了二十九户名——因为康惠茂给住在安乐屯的侄子也报了名。接着当场又选出了七个人组成了农业生产合作社的管理委员会。
    当晚散会已经是半夜一点多钟了，工作组的同志十分兴奋，连夜写信向县委作了报告。
    党委的一封信使干部们头脑清醒了
    第二天下午，工作组接到了县委的一封急信：
    “……从报告里，只看到群众对农业生产合作社的热烈欢迎，看不到群众对农业生产合作社有什么糊涂思想及具体顾虑。就目前余庆屯群众的觉悟程度来看，群众热烈要求成立农业生产合作社是事实；但是，不能一点顾虑没有，也不可能在很短时间内把糊涂思想完全解决了。因此，我们要更深入地、全面地研究群众中各种潜伏的思想；不能满足、也不应该只满足于群众的一时的热情，不从思想上解决问题，这种热情是不会巩固的，将来收拾也困难。其次，趁着群众的热情，在会上掀起报名入社的方法，也是不够妥当的。这样做的结果，会把一些思想不通还有顾虑的人，在群众热情激动之下带进来，这可能就是将来垮台的因素。因此，在报名入社时，必须给群众以充分的考虑时间，再三强调自愿。……”
    县委的信，使工作组的同志们大吃一惊。但是他们当时还憋着股劲，认为：群众就是有思想问题，也不会严重到成为“垮台的因素”。他们重新拿出中共中央东北局关于建立生产合作社的指示来仔细地看。又讨论了一下，这才认识到：在会上被代替报名的人，是谈不到自愿的；尤其是住在外屯的人，他们连最低的关于建立农业生产合作社的教育都没有受到，更谈不到自愿了。
    于是，他们当晚就召开了党员、积极分子会议。问题马上暴露出来了。据大家汇报：全屯报名的人里边，将近一半的人，入社的动机和思想情况是非常复杂的。例如，马振玉一听要成立农业生产合作社，就说：“都说将来共产，这回可到了！不干活也有吃的了！”金玉安本不想报名，觉得自己在外边
    “施展得开”；入了社，牲口、土地就“保不定是谁的了”。但是，他怕不入社人家会说他落后，就硬着头皮替儿子报了名。报完名，别人都是有说有笑，他回去连饭都吃不下去。
    群众的思想问题，比工作组原来估计到的又复杂、又严重。
    怎么办呢？开始，大伙想出了三个办法：一个是劝告入社还不自愿的人出社，单另组织互助组；一个是解散了重新酝酿、组织；一个是都留在社内慢慢教育。讨论结果，为了真正达到完全自愿，还是采取第二个办法：重新酝酿，然后再报名建社。
    宣布根据自愿原则重新报名以后，有思想问题的人暴露得就更明显了。工作组和党员、干部们对他们反复进行了教育。一面解释自愿入社的方针；一面根据本村土地、劳力等具体情况，和群众一块精打细算，计算入社后的收入到底有多少。大伙亲自参加算账：入社后一个劳力的收入，要比换工组里一个中农的收入还多一倍。这样，原来不相信可以多收入的人相信了。但是，第二次报名的头一天晚上，金成海问积极分子王德海：“收入会多，我相信；可是到底能不能真分那么多呢。谁敢保证？”听到王德海说“敢保证”，金成海这才下了狠心，“先入进去试试看”。
    经过反复酝酿以后，三月十九日又重新报名组织了农业生产合作社。经过这一番周折，工作组和余庆屯的干部们的头脑开始清醒了。
    老办法行不通
    建社后三天里订好了生产计划，立即开始送粪，紧接着就种麦了。
    当时整个农业生产由第一副主任王德海具体负责，人畜力和生产工具全归他统一调配。为了便于开会，简单地以十字路口为界，东西两面分为两个组，指定了两名组长。看来领导上准备得挺周到：生产组分好了，那块地种啥也划好了，种子也换好了；于是，开始播种了。
    种麦子时，不管地多少，六付犁总是在一块。南坡的麦地只剩半垧了，还是六付犁一齐去干，一会儿就种完了，大家又从南坡转到北岗。二十多个人，走路怪热闹；但是，大家走这么一趟，合计起来就浪费了四、五个工。
    干过两三天，副主任王德海就“蒙”了。拌种需要人，下地种麦子需要人，送粪、刨槎子又需要人。三十多个劳力，每天要分一次工。管理委员会的干部为了分工，每天都开半夜会。散会后，副主任还要挨门按户通知。几天工夫，王德海两眼熬得通红。常常连饭都顾不得吃。有时晚上散会晚了，就得在第二天早晨布置每个社员的工作；大家下地时，日头已经挺高了。有时候因为分工不明确，有的人找不到活干，有的人被漏下了。又因为临时分工，社员们事先没有准备，到下地时就乱抓农具。有的人到地里没带家具，就坐在地头上晒太阳。入社时思想问题没有彻底解决的人，趁着这个机会就“磨”起来了。
    这种严重的混乱、窝工和忙闲不均的现象，使好多社员思想动摇了。劳动积极的任怀志提出：“刨槎子十分，磨洋工也十分，不干活还是十分，再这样我不干了！”耿海君等积极分子急得直叨咕：“这不就完了吗？”金成海、翟长江看到这种情况，一声不响，背后说：“干吧，反正没个好！”
    摸出了新办法
    在种麦的十一天里，一共浪费了一百八十多个人工。党员和积极分子都感到问题非常严重。春耕结束时，党小组召开了一个会议，并吸收非党积极分子参加。大伙一致认为：主要问题是领导干部用了原来领导互助组的老方法来领导农业生产合作社，摊子大了，调配不开。
    怎样领导才不浪费工，而且能够更充分地发挥合作社的优越性呢？干部和全体社员在县委工作组的帮助下讨论了三、四天，决定实行定质、定量、定时、分工负责的制度：按工作需要向小组分配劳动日，根据条件定出劳动量、工时和工作质量，并由小组最后负责产量。在组织上，又重新按着人力、畜力的强弱改组了两个生产组，根据具体情况，把积极分子和两个副主任调配在两个组里。然后根据两组的力量和土地情况，划分了耕作区。并在总结种麦、动员春耕的大会上，发起了爱国丰产红旗竞赛。
    春耕开始，全社马上出现了新的气象。下地的钟声没响，就都聚齐了。有些人点籽时一个人跟了两付犁。王哲明有一天搂槎子，耙子搂坏了便用手搂。两个生产组为了实现定额，自动减去了一小时午睡时间，又自动动员了过去从来不参加农业生产劳动的十二名妇女参加了春耕。
    在春耕中，为了有效地实行定额管理制度，及时供应生产工具、种子和粪肥，使生产组能够按照定额进行生产，又进一步建立了保证合同制（管理委员会和各生产组订立定额保证合同）、检查制和劳动纪律；每组选出一名定额检查委员，专门检查对定额的执行情况。
    批判了本位主义思想
    社员的生产积极性普遍提高了，两个组都自动提高了产量定额。但是，在红旗竞赛当中，又产生了本位主义思想。这一组为了得红旗，光顾本组生产方便，不管另一组和全社工作是不是受影响。有的社员甚至盼着另一组做坏了，以便显出自己来。春耕开始时，社里买了三付新耲耙。第一组立刻把使坏了的旧耲耙（修理一下还可以用）推给第二组，要求把三付新的全给他们。社里修牛圈时需要四个人工，向两组各抽两个人，本来当时都有人可抽，但一组组长王殿阁怕竞赛落后，拒绝抽人。后来收拾水田，需要三个人工。当时第一组人力比较充裕，但是他们说：“别管忙闲，一样的组，要出人就都出。”最严重的时候，两个组干活碰到一块都不说话了。
    领导干部脱开了原来的事务主义圈子，很快就发现了这个问题。首先，在党的小组会上批评了党员中“各顾各”的本位主义思想。接着召开了社员大会，由党员干部带头检讨。大家明白了：一个组搞不好，全组的收入就减少，每个人都有份。只有全体一条心，庄稼才能侍弄好，收入才能多。当时好多人都主动检讨了光顾自己的思想行为，认识到那太不应该了。
    开了这个会，社员们的集体主义思想普遍提高了。种麦子的最后一天，第一组有八亩种不完。第二组种完本组的谷子，没有歇气，全组连人带马都到第一组的地上去，一鼓劲便帮助种完了。第一组社员任怀志高兴地说：“现在咱们可真成一家人了！”隔了不两天，第一组先种完了糜子，又去帮助第二组。
    还是这一些人，干了那么多活
    一九五二年五月十三日，全部春耕比一九五一年提前半月结束了。这是从来没有过的事。为了教育大家，开了一个总结春耕的全体社员大会。大家听了主任孙文海的总结报告以后，真有些不敢相信，这么多活，还是一九五一年那些人力、畜力干出来的。
    不仅播种时间比一九五一年提前和缩短了半个月到一个月，耕地的质量和施肥的数量也都超过了一九五一年。一九五一年全屯施肥不足全耕地面积的百分之十八，一九五二年达到了百分之百。地种得比一九五一年细致、应时得多了。从种麦到春耕结束，不过五十天的时间，用和一九五一年同样多的人力、畜力，比一九五一年多干了两千三百一十三个工的活。
    孙文海主任刚刚报告完，全场就哄起来了。大家都争着要讲自己心里的话。原来不相信农业生产合作社能干好的人，现在都说：单干不用说啦，就是在互助组里，也干不出这么些活呀！金成海、翟长江（都是老中农）干了一春天没有个笑容，在这天总结会上也变了样子。
    还是“不托底”
    总结了春耕竞赛，评奖了春耕中的模范以后，紧接着展开了夏锄爱国丰产红旗竞赛，社员们的生产积极性比春耕时更加提高了。可是，有的社员开始觉得在农业生产合作社里“太累了”。王成德说：“合作社好是好，就是活紧、纪律紧、开会紧，可真有些受不了。”孙文增五十多岁了，被选为农业生产合作社管理委员，非常高兴，没歇一天工。但是夏锄竞赛展开以后，他也感觉到：“这样干到多?是个头呢？光说将来要走共产主义，谁知道那时啥样呢？”他要求不当干部了。“激进分子”张福增看到农业生产合作社好，便主张：“来年牲口、土地别再吃租子，都交给社里，来个集体化！”抱着“吃大堆”的想法入社的马振玉，看到农业生产合作社的庄稼长得好，就一个劲地叨咕：“农业生产合作社庄稼真好，干不干都行啦，反正到秋有我一份。”整个春耕阶段，四十多天，他只干了十四天活。张怀晶也说：“我算不图大富大贵，反正到时候有我一份就行！”金成海、翟长江等老中农，虽然在春耕总结以后，转变了原来的消极态度；但是对将来会走到那个地步还是不托底。听到张福增、马振玉等人的话，心里又慌了。
    党员李耀德、刘万春等人，仍然是埋头干活，给群众作样子。但是对于群众的思想顾虑，就不知道应该怎样解决才好。他们光知道将来到社会主义共产主义社会，非常的好，但是究竟怎么好法，自己也弄不清楚。
    共产主义教育的力量
    为了使大伙儿看到幸福的远景，树立起前进的信心，夏锄期间，领导干部利用每天晚上的时间，以“共产党领导中国人民向那个方向走”、“共产主义社会的好处”、“要想早日实现共产主义社会，必须齐心努力把农业生产合作社办好”等为中心内容，向社员进行教育。讲完一课，就分组讨论。这些议题吸引了全体社员。过去从来不参加会的王德厚、刘克敬等，也都抢先去听讲。有些老年人虽然不能来听，当他们家的人听完回去后，也常常问到小半夜。
  孙文增正在要求不当干部，听讲以后，心里透亮了。他想：共产主义好处千千万，要想过那样日子，现在不吃点累，什么时候也到不了。他在讨论会上说：“现在吃点累，这是为了过好日子，我不要求不干了，一定要把农业生产合作社办好。”不干活的马振玉，听到将来也是谁不劳动谁就没得饭吃，也主动地在全体讨论会上做了检讨。“不图大富大贵、干活不前不后”的张怀晶，听到了共产主义那时的好日子，精神也振作起来了。
    丰收进一步教育了全体社员
    虽然已经进行了多次教育，大部分社员的思想逐步提高了，但有些社员的思想还是动荡的。许多人说：“农业生产合作社省工出活是不错，就是不知道秋天怎么分粮食。”
    庄稼熟了。这是余庆屯的第一次大丰收。已经收的麦子，和一部分糜子已经按照原定的分配办法分配给大家了。那些思想仍在动荡，对农业生产合作社半信半疑的人，开始安下心来了。他们作了自我批判。没有入社的胡长海后悔地说：“我算一步走错了，来年我一定要入社。”
    秋收正好在国庆节前后，社员们为了迎接国庆，一个赛一个地细割，保证“一粒不丢，做好秋收”。五十多岁的社员孙文增在割高粱时，因为天黑，掉下几个高粱穗没有拣，第二天一大早就跑到地里一一拾起。他们在收割中创造了割、捆、堆各有专人负责、互助连接的流水式收割方法。用了这个方法，全社仅割谷子就节省了四十二个工。他们不到二十天就全部割完了大田，比往年提前了七天。
    他们的各种庄稼的产量大大超过了一九五一年。小麦每垧产二千四百五十斤，比一九五一年增产百分之二百五十；大豆每垧产三千五百斤，比一九五一年增产百分之一百五十；稻子增产百分之一百十二；谷子增产百分之七十四；玉米增产百分之三十三。全社一百四十多垧大田，共计收获七十一万零五百九十斤标准粮，加上拉脚、采伐等副业收入，全社一九五二年总收入合计七十五万零五百多斤粮食。除去地租、牲口租、公粮、马料、车工、种子、公积金及其他一切开支，净剩三十九万斤粮，每个劳动力可分一万三千斤，合二十多石，比一九五一年每个劳动力的平均收入多了两倍（土地和牲畜的收入不在内）。
    还要干得更好
    丰收了，群众进一步相信了合作社的好处，加强了集体观念和爱国心。无论在劳动中、在会议上或者个别谈话中，随时随地都可以听到社员们高兴地说：丰收了，多亏农业生产合作社，集体力量大呀！要是往年呀，累死咱们，余庆屯这个山坡子地也长不出这样的好庄稼！他们还不满足，还要求做得更好些。在讨论使用自己的粮食的时候，很多社员都异口同声地说：“买新式农具，买好马。”金成海说：“打下来粮食，可不能大吃大喝。现在咱们底子还空，还是先搞好生产为主。”姜洪臣和姚秀珍都说：咱们现在生活虽然好了，但是比起苏联的集体农庄还相差天地。我们现在先搞好农业生产合作社，以后奔向集体农庄，那时就更好了。
