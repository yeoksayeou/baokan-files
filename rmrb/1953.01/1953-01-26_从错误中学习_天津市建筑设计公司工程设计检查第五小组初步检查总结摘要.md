Learning from Mistakes
--Abstract of Preliminary Inspection Summary by the Fifth Inspection Group of the Tianjin Architectural Design Company

    In order to accept the experiences and lessons learned from architectural engineering design in Tianjin in 1952, correct design perspectives and work attitudes, and improve ideological and technical levels, at the end of last year, our company's engineering and technical personnel, under the leadership of superiors, conducted inspections of some design projects in groups. Our group inspected the employee and family dormitory project of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China in Liuli Tai.
    During the five-day on-site inspection, we discovered many shortcomings and errors in the engineering design. After analysis and research, we initially identified the causes of this phenomenon and received specific and vivid education from it. Now, we will preliminarily summarize the problems identified as follows:
        I. Site Selection
    There are serious shortcomings in the selection of the site for this project. For example, the east, north, and west sides of the site are adjacent to factories with many chimneys. Except when the south wind is blowing, the building's airspace is often shrouded in coal smoke. Groundwater cannot be drained from the site, so a pumping station must be built outside the building boundary, and a transformer room and high-voltage lines must be installed. A 300-meter connection pipe must be installed to connect to the nearby main pipe for the water source. The costs of these projects are enormous, and transportation is inconvenient. Cars cannot enter until the planned road is opened.
    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the designers only accommodated the higher elevation of the site when selecting the site, without considering the possibility of filling and transforming the terrain. As a result, they lost more than they gained, and the overall design was restricted, leading to a series of problems with water, electricity, dust, and transportation. From this, we realized that a thorough design in basic construction cannot be considered only from the building itself or its internal structure, but must be planned comprehensively, grasping as much data as possible about the topography, surrounding environment, location of water and power sources, and future development, before selecting a location to obtain the most economical and practical plan. At the same time, we must also understand and study city planning issues such as the city's land zoning and road system to prevent blindness in design work.
        II. Overall Layout
    There are also many problems in the overall layout. For example, the buildings are not arranged appropriately according to the shape of the site, and the problem of lighting is ignored. The outermost row of houses facing east mechanically adopts standard drawings, without windows, and cannot utilize the eastern sunlight; the houses are arranged too closely together, and many rooms never see or rarely see sunlight all year round. The entire dormitory is planned to house 300 households, approximately 1,500 people, but there are not enough public buildings. There isn't even a meeting space for more than 30 people. Public auxiliary buildings account for only 1.5% of the total dormitory area. The buildings are not connected by a neat path, and the general paths are too narrow, making it inconvenient for vehicles to pass. The water and sewage pipes intersect and overlap due to the influence of the paths, making repairs very troublesome in the future. At the same time, there is no systematic design for rainwater drainage, and such a large building has no fire-fighting equipment.
    The reason for the above shortcomings is that in the design work, people wanted to save trouble and cater to the client, simply designing three types of dormitories and rigidly placing them on the overall site without considering the overall layout at all. The design process was clearly to have individual designs first, then forced them together and placed them on the overall plan. Later, when encountering road problems, they would solve road problems; when encountering water and electricity problems, they would solve water and electricity problems, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, resulting in nothing being satisfactory. From this, we realized that when dealing with the design of large areas of buildings, we must start with the overall layout. Standard drawings should be utilized as much as possible, but the standard drawings must adapt to the terrain conditions, and the terrain conditions cannot adapt to the standard drawings. If necessary, the standard drawings should be changed without hesitation, and it cannot be considered complete just to forcibly place them on the site. As for designing roads or leaving space between houses, attention should be paid to the fact that this is not just a matter of space on the ground, but also to the arrangement of underground pipes. In addition, such buildings are not simply a building problem, but also require attention to the social activities and various needs of the masses, and to take care of a broader side of life than just the housing problem. This design clearly did not pay attention to this point. For example, the water and sewage pipes of the eighty-two public toilets are all concealed pipes, with no heating equipment or chimney vents for stoves. As a result, in winter, in order to prevent frozen pipes, a temporary stove must be installed in each room. Not only does each window have a section of chimney sticking out, which is unsanitary and unsightly, but the client also has to bear the cost of eight people taking turns to watch the stoves day and night for four months in winter.
        III. Building Design Itself
            (1) Applicability
    In terms of applicability, the design of this building was found to have as many as 56 shortcomings. For example, there is no place to dry clothes, dump garbage, or store coal; there is no place to store bicycles, and residents have to carry their bikes up and down the stairs, which is very inconvenient. Each floor has picture rails, costing 135 million yuan in materials, but their use is limited, while the necessary window sills for residents are missing. All door locks are the same, and can be opened with one key. Types B and C dormitories have open staircases, which are slippery when it rains in summer and snows and freezes in winter, and are also not aesthetically pleasing. The kitchens of Types B and C dormitories are located at both ends of the building, with a distance of up to 30 meters from the living rooms, and there are no stove eyes, chimney eyes, sewage pools, or faucets. Residents are reluctant to cook in the kitchens, and many households have lit stoves at their doors. Some earthenware pipes of the sewer are buried too shallow (about 40 cm below the ground), freeze in the cold weather, and the client bakes them with straw every day. The indoor water pipes are concealed pipes, which freeze in the cold weather and are inconvenient to repair. It is difficult to thaw the water pipes in winter. There are no shut-off valves on the water supply branches, and the entire water gate must be closed during repairs, which has a great impact. There are no pull cords, sockets, or hand switches for the bedroom lights, which is very inconvenient for residents.
    From these many shortcomings, it can be seen that the original design was completely based on subjective intentions, arbitrarily arranged, wanting to save trouble, rush the work, and only seek the client's agreement and the approval of the Construction Bureau on the drawings, and then consider the task completed, without thoroughly considering the general living habits and needs of the residents. As a result, only the surface is emphasized, which is unrealistic, the necessary equipment is missing or insufficient, and there are many unnecessary decorations. From this, we deeply realize that designers must first clarify the design concept of serving the people in order to do a good job in design. Only after thoroughly studying the nature of the building's use and appropriately experiencing the living habits of the users can a correct and applicable design be made. At the same time, designers must also have a full understanding of the construction procedures and material specifications, and design with a realistic and pragmatic spirit. This design is because the designer lacked experience in the building's water and sewage pipes, electric lights, and boiler projects, only marking the location on the drawings without wiring instructions, sloppy and perfunctory, so that the construction workers did not know how to leave pipes, and installed them arbitrarily, affecting the quality of the project.
            (2) Solidity
    The inspection found that there are many places in this project that are detrimental to solidity. For example, the chimney is built on the corner of the T-shaped wall, which affects the solidity of the wall. Part of the purlins of Type B dormitory are placed on the plywood of the main beams, which affects the solidity of the main beams, etc. From this, we realized that strengthening the inspection work during the construction process is a powerful factor in ensuring the quality of the project, and special attention must be paid. In this project, due to the lack of thorough design, lack of experience of the supervisor, and insufficient inspection work, the wooden purlins were not properly braced, some of the wooden beams of the wooden frame were rotten, the purlins were placed on the plywood heads, and the beams were erected on brick chimneys, etc., which affected the quality of the project. This also shows that the design cannot be static. During construction, the designer should always maintain close contact with the construction workers through the on-site inspection personnel, and constantly absorb opinions, so as to study and modify any possible shortcomings in the original design.
            (3) Economy
    From an economic point of view, inspecting this project, we found 12 major problems that caused waste, with the waste figure reaching more than 3.7 billion yuan, about one-seventh of the total cost. If this money were not wasted, not only would the solidity and beauty problems be solved in the same way, but it would also be more applicable. The main reason for such a large waste is not limited by technical capabilities, but because of irresponsibility and incorrect design concepts, and even wasting state resources and increasing costs in order to receive more design fees.
    The designers are irresponsible and did not conduct good investigations and research before the design to grasp reliable actual data. The calculation work in the design lacks a scientific basis, so it is inevitable to underestimate the stress of the materials used and excessively increase the safety factor in order to be "safe," resulting in waste. For example, in this design, because the geology was not drilled, the foundation that could be made of three-step lime soil was designed as five-step lime soil, wasting more than 390 million yuan. From this, we realized that we must be responsible for state property in the design and implement the spirit of economic accounting; if a certain part of the building exceeds the requirements for solidity, it is equivalent to waste.
    The designer's masterpiece thinking is also a reason for waste. In the design of the more than 50-meter-long cement eaves (rain shields) of this project, the designer, according to the dogma of "no columns are needed, the bigger the cantilever, the better it looks," purely pursued formal beauty, designed to cantilever 1.5 meters. In order to support such a long cantilever, two layers of cement ring beams were added. As a result, this design wasted more than 1.8 billion yuan. Moreover, the eaves are now cracked a lot because they are too long and leaking water. At the same time, they block the sunlight, and the residents have a lot of opinions.
    The designer lacks construction experience, did not fully consider it in advance, did not draw detailed drawings, and still did not study it in time during construction. As a result, problems were temporarily discovered and solutions were improvised, resulting in waste. For example, the original design for the cornice part above the cement eaves was 20 cm high, but the thickness of the wooden frame beam head itself was forgotten during the design, and no detailed drawings were drawn. When it was found to be wrong during construction, it was uniformly increased to 50 cm, which was neither beautiful nor conducive to receiving rainwater, wasting more than 73 million yuan. From this, it can be seen that the designer must provide the site with detailed drawings for thorough consideration during the design, and also consider the materials that can be supplied in the market and their production specifications, so as to avoid waste in the processing process.
    The structural design does not proceed from reality, but mechanically moves the book. For example, the inclined beam of the Type B dormitory in this project, according to the 45-degree intersection, is close to a load-bearing gable wall, and the distance is only 40 cm. It can be used in many ways, but a 9-meter span wooden frame is added parallel to the gable wall, and there is a brick wall (partition wall) in the middle of the frame that can be used as a fulcrum (load). Made into a half frame, because it was not done this way, the stress situation of the middle upright is changed from tension to pressure, which is not only unreasonable, but also causes serious waste. From this, we realized that when dealing with technical problems, we cannot mechanically stick to the book, but must proceed from the actual situation and try to find the knack to achieve the purpose of saving.
            (4) Aesthetics
    The design's requirement for beauty is simply based on the formal aspects of the four-sloping roof and the 1.5-meter cement eaves and rain eaves. The cost of the four-sloping roof alone is more than 480 million yuan for the beam frame. Some bystanders may appreciate the large eaves and rain eaves as being novel in style, but users have no fondness for the large corridor that is 53 meters long and only 95 cm wide (when the window is open); in addition, it blocks the sunlight, and the downstairs residents are particularly disgusted with it. From this, we realized that the beauty of architectural design should be subordinate to the two conditions of applicability and economy.
        IV. Problems with Architectural Drawings
    Checking the architectural drawings, we found 24 errors. A large part of the reason for the errors is that the design drawings are made by several people separately, without contact with each other. After the drawings are completed, they are submitted to the client without comprehensive and thorough review, considering the task to be completed. The most typical example is the foundation lime soil. Because the drawings were drawn by two people, the width of the Type A dormitory is 1.2 meters for the same structural situation, while the width of the Type B and C dormitories is 1.1 meters. Obviously, if there is no problem with making 1.1 meters, then the 10 cm of 1.2 meters is redundant. This "difference of one stroke" alone wastes 250 cubic meters of lime soil and a lot of labor, costing more than 10 million yuan. In order to avoid these errors, the drawings made separately in the future should be concentrated and carefully reviewed to unify the specifications and practices. At the same time, when making drawings, designers must also fully consider the difficulties that future construction workers may encounter with a spirit of responsibility to the project. Design drawings are for the convenience of valuation and construction, so they must be made so that estimators, construction units, and the site can understand the drawings at a glance. The more difficult it is to do, the more detailed and clear the drawings should be, and no small place can be perfunctory. In this design, due to the lack of full mastery of the design data, closed-door production, the sewer was first designed according to the separate flow, and then rejected by the Sanitary Engineering Bureau to change to the combined flow, and all the drawings were invalidated.

    从错误中学习
    ——天津市建筑设计公司工程设计检查第五小组初步检查总结摘要
    为了接受一九五二年天津市建筑工程设计中的经验教训，端正设计观点和工作态度，提高思想水平和技术水平，去年年底，我们公司的工程技术人员在上级的领导下，分组进行了部分设计工程的检查。我们小组检查的是人民银行天津分行六里台员工眷属宿舍工程。
    在五天的实地检查中，我们发现了工程设计中的许多缺点和错误，经过分析研究，初步找出了造成这种现象的原因，从中受到了具体生动的教育。现在，我们将检查出的问题初步总结如下。
        一、选择基地
    本工程在选择基地上存在着严重的缺点。如基地东、北、西三面都邻工厂，烟囱很多，除刮南风外，煤烟经常笼罩建筑物上空。基地下水排不出去，只得另在建筑界外兴建抽水房，电源也需要自建变压器室，自装高压线路。水源要自己安设三百公尺的接管，与附近的干管接通。这些工程的费用非常巨大，而且交通不便，在计划马路未开辟前，汽车进不去。
    造成这种现象的主要原因，是设计者选择基地时只迁就了基地较高的一个条件，而没有考虑可以填土改造地形，以致因小失大，使全面的设计受到拘束，发生了水电、灰尘、交通等一系列的问题。由此我们认识到：基本建设中一个周密的设计工作，不可只由建筑物本身或内部构造考虑，而必须全盘计划，尽量掌握地形、地势和四周环境、水电源的位置，以及将来的发展等各项资料，然后选择位置，才能得到最经济适用的计划方案。同时也要了解和研究全市的土地区划、道路系统等城市计划问题，以防止设计工作的盲目性。
        二、总平面布置
    在总平面布置上也存在不少问题。如没有按照基地形状适当布置建筑物，忽略了采光问题，向东的最外一列房子，因机械地采用标准图样，没有窗子，不能利用东向的阳光；房屋排列过密，很多房间终年看不到或很少看到阳光。全部宿舍计划居住三百户约一千五百人，但没有足够的公共建筑物，三十人以上的集会房子都没有，公用性附属建筑仅占宿舍总面积的百分之一点五。建筑物没有一条整齐的甬路连系，而且一般甬路太窄，行车不便。上下水道因受甬路影响，交叉重叠，日后修理非常麻烦。同时，雨水宣泄没有系统的设计，这样大的建筑物竟没有消防设备。
    造成以上缺点的原因，是在设计工作中图省事，应付业主，单纯设计了三种形式的宿舍，死硬地摆在总地盘上，根本没有从总平面上通盘考虑。设计程序显然是先有了个体的设计，再勉强凑到一起，摆在总平面中，以后碰到道路问题再解决道路问题，碰到水电问题再解决水电问题，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，结果一无是处。由此我们认识到：在处理大片建筑物设计工作时，必须由全面布局着手，标准图样固应尽可能考虑利用，但必须使标准图适应地形条件，而不能使地形条件适应标准图，必要时应不惜更改标准图样，不能勉强摆入基地，就算完事。至于设计道路或留房屋间隔，则应注意这不仅是地面上空间问题，同时也要照顾地下管路的排列。此外，这样的建筑物不单纯是一个建筑问题，同时还要照顾群众的社会活动和各方面的需要，照顾比居住问题更广泛的生活一面。本设计显然没有注意这一点。如八十二个公共厕所的上下水道全是暗管子，既无暖汽设备，又没有留生炉子的烟囱眼，结果冬季为了防止冻管子，必须每间安一个临时火炉，这样不但每个窗户要冒出一节烟囱，不卫生又不好看，同时业主还要负担冬季四个月八个人昼夜轮流看管火炉的费用。
        三、建筑物本身设计
            （一）适用
    本建筑物的设计，在适用方面，发现缺点达五十六条之多。如没有晒衣服、倒垃圾和堆放煤的地方；没有存放自行车的地方，住户要自己扛车上下楼，非常不便。各楼室内都有挂镜线，用料费一亿三千五百万元，用途不大，而住户必需的窗台板反而没有。门锁全是一样的，能用一把钥匙打开。乙、丙种宿舍是明楼梯，夏天落雨、冬天下雪上冻滑人，也不美观。乙、丙种宿舍的厨房设在楼的两头，与住室最远的距隔达三十公尺，又没有灶眼、烟筒眼、污水池和水龙头，住户全不乐意到厨房做饭，很多户在门口自己生了火炉子。下水道一部缸管埋得太浅（约在地面下四十公分），天冷冻坏，业主天天用稻草烘烤。室内自来水管是暗管，天冷冻坏，不便修理，冬天水管冻了很难烤开。上水支管没有做截门，修理时要关闭总水闸，影响很大。卧室电灯没有吊铊、插销和手电门，住户很感不便。
    从这许多缺点中可以看出：原设计完全是依照主观意图，随意安排，图省事，图赶工，只求在图面上取得业主同意，建设局核准后，即算交差，而没有周密考虑住户的一般生活习惯和需要，以致只注重表面，不切实际，需要的设备没有或不够，不需要的装饰却很多。由此我们深深体会到：设计者首先必须明确为谁服务的设计观点，才能搞好设计工作。只有在周密地研究了建筑物的使用性质，并适当地体验到使用者的生活习惯之后，才能做出正确的适用的设计来。同时，设计人还必须对施工程序及材料规格有充分的了解，用实事求是的精神进行设计。本设计就是因为设计者对于建筑物内上下水道及电灯、锅炉工程经验不够，只在图上标明位置而无线路指示，潦草塞责，以致施工者不晓得如何留管子，随意安装，影响了工程质量。
            （二）坚固
    检查中发现本工程有不少有碍坚固的地方。如烟筒砌在丁字墙角上，影响墙的坚固，乙种宿舍的部分房檩放在柁的夹板上，影响柁的坚固等。由此我们认识到：在施工过程中加强查验工作，是保证工程质量的有力因素，必须特别注意。在这个工程中，就由于设计不周密，监工缺乏经验，查验工作做得不够，以致造成木檩该打拐子而未打拐子，木柁架的料有的朽了，檩子放在夹板头上，柁架架在砖烟囱上等现象，影响了工程质量。这也说明：设计不能是一成不变的，在施工时设计者应随时通过工地检查人员，和施工者取得密切联系，随时吸取意见，据以研究修改原设计中可能存在的缺点。
            （三）经济
    从经济的观点来检查这个工程，我们发现了十二项造成浪费的主要问题，浪费数字达三十七亿余元，约为总造价的七分之一。假如不浪费这笔钱，不但同样解决了坚固和美观问题，而且还要更适用一些。造成这么大的浪费，主要不是受技术能力的限制，而是因为不负责任和设计观点不对头，甚至是不惜浪费国家资财，增大造价，以便收到较多的设计费。
    设计者不负责任，在设计之先没有经过很好的调查研究，掌握可靠的实际资料，设计中的计算工作缺乏科学的根据，这样就必然过低估计使用材料的应力，过高地增大安全系数，以图“保险”，结果造成浪费。如在本设计中，因为没有钻探地质，就把可用三步灰土的地基，设计成五步灰土，浪费了三亿九千多万元。由此我们认识到：在设计中必须对国家财产负责，贯彻经济核算的精神；建筑物中某一部分超过坚固的要求，即等于浪费。
    设计者的杰作思想，也是造成浪费的一个原因。在本工程的五十余公尺长的洋灰挑檐（雨罩）设计中，设计者根据“一个柱子也不要，挑得越大越好看”的教条，单纯追求形式美观，设计得挑出一点五公尺，为了支持这样长的挑檐，又打了两层洋灰圈梁，结果因这项设计浪费十八亿余元。而且挑檐因为太长，现在已开裂很多，已经漏水，同时挡住阳光，住户意见很大。
    设计者缺乏施工经验，事先未经充分考虑，没有绘制大样图，施工时仍不及时研究，以致临时发现问题临时凑合解决，造成浪费。如洋灰挑檐以上拔檐部分原设计为二十公分高，但设计时忘记木房架柁头本身的厚度，也未画大样图，及至施工时发现不对头，才一律提高为五十公分，既不美观，且有碍承接雨水，浪费达七千三百多万元。由此可知：设计时一定要供给工地考虑周详的大样详图，同时还要考虑市面上可能供给的材料及其生产规格，以避免加工过程中造成浪费。
    结构设计不从实际出发，机械地搬书本。如本工程乙种宿舍的斜柁，依照四十五度的交点，接近一道荷重山墙，距离仅四十公分，本可想法利用，但却与山墙平行又加一道九公尺跨度的木房架，而房架中间有一道砖墙（隔断墙）可做支点使用（荷重），做成半房架，因没有这样做，以致中间立人的应力情况由拉力变成压力，不但不合理，而且造成严重的浪费。由此我们认识到：在处理技术性的问题时，不能机械地死扣书本，要从实际情况出发，想法找窍门，以达到节约的目的。
            （四）美观
    本设计对美的要求，是单纯从四坡顶子和一公尺半的洋灰挑檐及雨檐等形式出发的。四坡顶子的代价仅柁架一项就需四亿八千多万元，大挑檐和雨檐由某些旁观者去欣赏好像式样还很新颖，但使用者对于长五十三公尺而宽只九十五公分（当窗子打开时）的大走廊，却没有一点好感；再加以遮住了阳光，楼下住户对它尤其厌恶。由此我们认识到：建筑设计的美，应当服从适用和经济两个条件。
        四、建筑图样上的问题
    从建筑图样上来检查，我们发现了二十四处错误。发生错误的原因，很大一部分是由于设计图是由几个人分作，互不联系，图样完成后未经综合和周密的审核，交给业主就算完成任务。最典型的如基础灰土，就因为图是两个人画的，结果同样的结构情况，而甲种宿舍宽度是一点二公尺，乙、丙种宿舍却是一点一公尺。显然，如果一点一公尺做出来没问题，那么一点二公尺的就多余了十公分，仅这“一笔之差”就浪费二百五十立方公尺灰土和许多劳动力，多花一千多万元。为了避免这些错误，今后分散作的图样，应集中起来，认真审核，统一规格及做法。同时，设计者在做图时，还必须以对工程负责的精神，充分考虑到将来施工者可能遇到的困难。设计图是为了便利估价，便利施工，因此一定要做到使估算者和施工单位及现场看了图一目了然，越是难做的地方，越应画得仔细，简单明了，一点小地方也不能马虎过去。在本设计中，由于没有充分掌握设计资料，闭门造车，下水道先按分流设计完成，后经卫生工程局批驳改为合流，全部图样作废。
