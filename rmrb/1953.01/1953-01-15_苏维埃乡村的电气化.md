    Electrification of the Soviet Countryside
    In the collective farms of Ukraine, in the villages of the Soviet Far East, in the forest logging areas of Karelia-Finland, and across the vast Soviet land, new power stations are opening almost every day. The electricity generated by these power stations brings light and happiness to millions of Soviet people living in the countryside and mountains.

    Rural electrification, which is still a goal and a cherished ideal for farmers in many countries today, has rapidly become a reality in the Soviet Union.

    The scale of Soviet agricultural electrification is now the largest in the world. In the post-war years, the total generating capacity of Soviet rural power stations has increased three and a half times, and the number of electrified collective farms has increased sixfold. The total power generation of rural power stations in the Soviet Union is now equivalent to ten times that of the pre-war period. In Ukraine, the "granary of Europe" and the main grain-producing area of the Soviet Union, the number of rural power stations has increased to 4,500, which is one and a half times the pre-war number. Collective farms and machine tractor stations in Ukraine now have more than 30,000 generators, and more than 1,500 electrified threshing grounds have been established on collective farms. In Belarus, in the Baltic coastal regions, and in the various Soviet republics of Central Asia, rural power stations are springing up like mushrooms after rain.

    Electrification has brought about enormous changes in Soviet agricultural production. In fully electrified collective farms, electric tractors are commonly seen traversing the vast fields. They can plow six hectares per hour, which is more than double the area plowed by ordinary tractors, and can save more than 20 tons of liquid fuel per hectare of farmland. In the electrified countryside of the Soviet Union, electricity is now widely used in almost all agricultural production work, except for more complex tasks such as sowing and harvesting. Electric threshing machines operated by three people have replaced the hand-cranked threshing machines that originally required eight people to manage, while increasing work efficiency by two times. In the summer, people do not have to thresh grain during the day when the sun is scorching, but can move this work to the cool evenings. This not only improves working conditions but also increases work efficiency. In the severe winter, the greenhouses of collective farms use electric heat to ripen vegetables early, preparing seedlings for orchards and gardens. In Uzbekistan, famous for cotton planting, many collective farms have built new devices for drying cotton with electricity. In animal husbandry, the application of electricity has also brought many conveniences to work. Electric water pumps, which automatically feed and water livestock, are installed in cowsheds, allowing dairy cows to drink water whenever they need, which increases milk production by 10 to 15 percent. Using shearing machines equipped with 100-watt generators to shear wool is more than three times as efficient as manual shearing.

    The widespread application of electricity in agricultural production is a feature of the Soviet countryside today. But the application of electricity is not just about reducing the labor of collective farmers and shortening their working hours. Electricity has also greatly changed the appearance of rural life. The days of spending nights in the flickering candlelight and using oil lamps for lighting are over. Now, after a day of hard work, Soviet collective farm members can sit down and turn on their radios to listen to news broadcasts and moving music from Moscow; young men and women can sing and dance in the brightly lit cultural palaces; and studious collective farm members can listen quietly to courses on agricultural science and technology in the bright classrooms of evening schools. A dense network of telephone and telegraph lines connects cities and villages, linking the lives of the entire Soviet country and its people into one.

    The scale of nationwide electrification in the Soviet Union will be further expanded in the future. Hundreds of Soviet scientists are studying the expansion of nationwide agricultural electrification, and hundreds of factories are manufacturing generators for collective farms across the country. When the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, the two largest hydroelectric stations in the world, are completed, the Soviet Union will become the country with the largest power generation in the world. At that time, more Soviet collective farms will receive more electricity. With the continuous emergence of large cities and industrial centers in agricultural areas, the essential difference between industrial and agricultural labor in the Soviet Union will tend to disappear, rural living conditions will rapidly catch up with those in the cities, and the Soviet people will be closer to a happy and fulfilling communist society.

### 苏维埃乡村的电气化

    苏维埃乡村的电气化
    在乌克兰的集体农庄，在苏维埃远东的乡村，在卡累利阿——芬兰的森林伐木区，在辽阔广大的苏维埃国土上，几乎每天都有新的电力站举行开工典礼。这些电力站所发出来的电力给生活在乡村里、山野上的千百万苏维埃人民带来了光明和幸福。
    乡村电气化，这对今天许多国家的农民来说，还是努力争取的目标和渴望着的理想，但在苏联却已迅速地成为现实。
    苏联农业电气化的规模现在已居于世界第一位。在战后几年来，苏联乡村电力站的总发电能力已增加了三倍半，电气化集体农场的数目增加到六倍。现在全苏联乡村电力站的发电量已相当于战前的十倍。在“欧洲的谷仓”——苏联的主要产粮区乌克兰，乡村电力站的数目已增加到四千五百个，相当于战前的一倍半。乌克兰的集体农场和机器拖拉机站现在共有三万多部发电机，集体农场上已建立起了一千五百多个电气化的打谷场。在白俄罗斯，在波罗的海沿岸与中亚细亚的各个苏维埃共和国，乡村电力站正像雨后春笋那样地迅速建立起来。
    电气化使苏联的农业生产发生了巨大的变化。在全盘电气化的集体农庄里，电气拖拉机已普遍地驰骋在广大的田野上，它们每小时可以耕地六公顷，超过普通拖拉机耕地面积的一倍，并可使每公顷土地的农田工作节省二十多吨的液体燃料。在苏联电气化了的乡村里，现在除了播种与收割等比较复杂的工作外，在农业生产工作中几乎都已普遍地应用了电力。由三人操纵的电力打谷机代替了原来要用八人来管理的手摇打谷机，而工作效率增加了两倍。在夏天，人们不必在烈日当头的白天打谷，而可以把这一工作移到凉风习习的夜晚去做。这样，不但改善了劳动的条件，而且也提高了工作的效率。在凛冽的严冬，集体农庄的温室就利用电的热力来使得蔬菜早日成熟，为果园与花园准备生苗。在以植棉闻名的乌兹别克，许多集体农庄已经建设了新的用电气使棉花干燥的装置。在畜牧业上，电力的应用也给工作带来了不少的便利。在牛棚中装设了可以自动喂饮牲畜的电力抽水器，乳牛就可以随自己的需要随时饮水，这使乳牛的产奶量提高百分之十至十五。用装有一百瓦特的发电机的剪毛机来剪取羊毛，要比人工剪毛工作的效率提高三倍以上。
    在农业生产上广泛应用电力是今天苏联农村的一个特点。但电力的应用绝不只是减轻集体农民的劳动，缩短他们的工作时间而已。电力使乡村的生活也大大地变了模样。在摇曳的烛光中度夜和用油灯来照明的日子已经成为过去了。现在，苏联的集体农庄庄员们在一天辛勤的劳动之后可以坐下来扭开自己的收音机，听一听从莫斯科传来的新闻广播和动人的音乐；年青的男女们可以在电炬通明的辉煌的文化宫里歌舞欢乐；好学不倦的集体农庄庄员们可以在业余学校的明亮的课室中，静听有关农业科学技术的课程。密如蛛网的电话电报网沟通着城市与乡村，把整个苏维埃国家与人民的生活连成一片。
    苏联全国电气化的规模将来还要进一步扩大。千百位苏联科学家正在研究扩大全国农业电气化的问题，成百个工厂正在为全国各地的集体农庄制造发电机。当古比雪夫水电站与斯大林格勒水电站这两个世界上最大的水电站，建造完成以后，苏联将成为世界上发电量最多的国家。那时，更多的苏维埃集体农庄将获得更多的电力供应。随着大城市与工业中心在农业地区的不断出现，苏联的工业劳动与农业劳动之间的本质差别将趋于消灭，乡村的生活条件将迅速向城市看齐，苏联人民将更加接近于幸福美满的共产主义社会。
