    Correcting Impatient and Rude Practices in Mass Propaganda Work

    Recent facts show that some factories and mines still have, to varying degrees, a simple and rude style in mass propaganda work. This style is manifested in the habit of using satirical and attacking methods to deal with workers' mistakes and shortcomings, and to treat "backward thinking" and "backward elements" among workers. The incident of criticizing workers' "backward thinking" in the Datong mining area not long ago is a typical example. Because the Datong mining area's leadership organs failed to complete the production increase and conservation plans for the first, second, and third quarters of last year, and there were more phenomena of workers violating operating procedures and labor discipline, they regarded criticizing "backward thinking" and "backward elements" among workers as one of the key points of the Party and trade union work, attempting to use this method to change the production situation in the mining area. Leaders of the Second Mine even openly divided workers into three categories: "active," "intermediate," and "backward," and made armbands of various colors for workers who violated operating procedures or had work-related injuries to wear as a sign of punishment. The First Mine concentrated "backward elements" to run training classes. As a result, of course, it could not achieve the goal of improving workers' production enthusiasm and changing the production situation in the mine, but only aroused workers' resentment, damaged the unity among workers, and damaged workers' production enthusiasm. After discovering this situation, the North China Administrative Council and the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee instructed the Datong mining area to correct this mistake.

    Similar incidents to the Datong mining area have also occurred in factories and mines in other places. For example, the Liaoyang Textile Factory in Northeast China once asked workers who had not completed their production tasks to make a "confession of conscience." The Northeast Electric Engineering Factory No. 6 once set up a "punishment platform" to specifically list the names of workers who violated labor discipline and operating procedures. The Shenyang Machinery Factory No. 3 once used the method of inserting black flags on the locomotives of workers who had not completed their production tasks. The Yumen Oil Refinery once used the method of inserting blue flags in units that had not completed their production tasks. All these methods, like the methods of the Datong mining area, did not have a positive effect on the workers, but only aroused the workers' resentment and damaged the workers' enthusiasm. These facts show that how to overcome the simple and rude style in mass propaganda work is a problem worthy of serious attention.

    These erroneous practices in mass propaganda work in the Datong mining area and many other factories and mines are obviously fundamentally contrary to the Party's principles of mass propaganda work in factories and mines. The basic principle of the Party's mass propaganda work in factories and mines should be to use the method of enlightening workers' consciousness and the method of democratic persuasion and education to improve workers' political enthusiasm, give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and encourage them to strive to complete and exceed production tasks. However, many factory and mine cadres completely do not understand this principle, and they attempt to replace this principle with the brutal spiritual "punishment" method that damages the workers' self-esteem. This leads the Party's mass propaganda work onto a very wrong path, thus fundamentally destroying the possibility of the Party's mass propaganda work playing a positive role as a means of mobilization and encouragement. This tendency is very dangerous if allowed to develop.

    Of course, our opposition to the satirical and attacking methods against workers' shortcomings and mistakes does not mean that criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out among workers. The question is how to conduct criticism and self-criticism. The correct method should be to carry out this criticism and self-criticism on the basis of enlightening workers' consciousness. Such criticism should be sincere, well-intentioned, and full of positive significance, rather than simply negative and one-sided accusations. Only such criticism and self-criticism can improve workers' political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, and can become a driving force for promoting workers' progress and the advancement of production work. However, the so-called "criticism" of the compulsory and rude type carried out by units such as the Datong mining area has nothing in common with this. A strict distinction should be made between correct criticism and self-criticism and this simple and rude practice.

    The mass propaganda work experience of the Shenyang 321 Factory (i.e., Factory 53) and the experience of the Shenyang 724 Factory in educating backward workers published in this newspaper today provide correct experience on how to conduct criticism and self-criticism among workers and how to educate and improve backward workers. Their methods are: 1. Specifically understand the workers' ideological problems, and conduct persuasive education work in response to these ideological problems; 2. Specifically understand the various problems in workers' lives, and help workers solve these problems; 3. Let workers examine themselves by using the method of "ideological comparison" with advanced figures and learn from the example of advanced workers; 4. Find typical figures among the backward masses, patiently persuade and sincerely help them, so that they can transform themselves and learn from advanced workers, and then use their experience of raising awareness to promote other workers with backward ideas to move forward. Facts have proved that their method is the most capable of guiding all workers to consciously move forward. And this conscious enthusiasm of the workers is the most reliable guarantee for completing all production plans. All regions should learn this method and avoid and overcome that simple and rude working method.

    It should be pointed out that not only in factories and mines, but also in rural mass propaganda work, there is also this simple and rude practice, and it can even be said to be more serious. This can be seen most clearly in the propaganda work on rural cooperation and mutual assistance. Some rural propagandists, when publicizing mutual assistance and cooperation, do not know how to publicize the superiority of mutual assistance and cooperation in order to attract farmers to consciously participate in mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, but mistakenly attack individual farmers, and even absurdly publicize that individual farming is "unpatriotic" and is taking the "path of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism." These absurd and erroneous propaganda have caused adverse effects in some places. In the future, all regions should strengthen the education of propagandists and earnestly prevent the continued occurrence of this adverse phenomenon.

### 纠正群众宣传工作中的急躁粗暴的作法

    纠正群众宣传工作中的急躁粗暴的作法
    最近许多事实说明，有些厂矿在群众宣传工作中还或多或少地存在着一种简单粗暴的作风，这种作风表现在习惯于以讽刺打击的办法去对待工人的错误和缺点，对待工人中间的“落后思想”和“落后分子”。不久前大同矿区批判工人“落后思想”的事件便是一个典型的例子。大同矿区的领导机关因为该矿去年第一、二、三季的增产节约计划都没有完成，工人中违反操作规程和劳动纪律的现象较多，即把在工人中间批判“落后思想”和批评“落后分子”当作党和工会工作的重点之一，企图用这种办法去改变矿区内的生产状况。二矿领导干部竟将工人公开地划分为“积极”“中间”“落后”三类，并作出各种颜色的袖章，让违反操作规程、发生公伤事故的工人带上，以示惩戒；一矿将“落后分子”集中起来开办训练班。其结果，当然不能达到提高工人的生产积极性、改变矿内生产状况的目的，只是引起了工人的反感，损害了工人之间的团结，损害了工人的生产积极性。华北行政委员会和中共中央华北局在发现这一情况后，已指示大同矿区纠正了这一错误。
    在其他地方的厂矿中也曾有过类似大同矿区事件的现象发生。例如东北辽阳纺织厂曾叫没有完成生产任务的工人作“良心检讨”；东北电工六厂曾办了一个“惩罚台”，专门把违反劳动纪律和操作规程的工人的名字列在上面；沈阳机械三厂曾使用在没有完成生产任务的工人的机车上插黑旗的办法；玉门炼油厂曾使用在没有完成生产任务的单位中插蓝旗的办法。所有这些办法，和大同矿区的作法一样，并未对工人发生积极的作用，而只是引起了工人的反感，损害了工人的积极性。这些事实说明，如何克服群众宣传工作中的简单粗暴的作风，是值得严重注意的一个问题。
    大同矿区以及其他许多厂矿的群众宣传工作中的这些错误作法，很显然，是与党在工矿中的群众宣传工作的原则根本相违背的。党在工矿中的群众宣传工作的基本原则，应该是用启发工人自觉的办法，用民主的说服教育的办法，去提高工人的政治热情，发挥他们的积极性和创造性，鼓励他们为完成和超过生产任务而奋斗。但许多厂矿干部却完全不了解这一原则，他们企图用损害工人自尊心的粗暴的精神“惩罚”办法去代替这一原则。这样就把党的群众宣传工作引上了一个非常错误的道路，因而也就根本破坏了党的群众宣传工作作为动员和鼓舞的手段所起积极作用的可能性。这种倾向任其发展下去是非常危险的。
    当然，我们反对对工人的缺点和错误采取讽刺打击的办法，并不是说就不可以在工人中间进行批评和自我批评。问题是怎样进行批评和自我批评。正确的办法应该是在启发工人自觉的基础上去展开这种批评和自我批评，这样的批评应该是诚恳的，善意的，富有积极意义的，而不单纯是消极的片面的指责。只有这样的批评和自我批评，才能提高工人的政治热情和生产积极性，才能成为推动工人进步和生产工作前进的动力。但像大同矿区等单位所进行的那种强迫命令式的简单粗暴的所谓“批评”是和这没有丝毫共同之点的。应当把正确的批评和自我批评与这种简单粗暴的作法严格地区别开来。
    沈阳三二一厂（即五三厂）的群众宣传工作经验和本报今天所发表的沈阳七二四工厂教育落后工人的经验，就为如何在工人中进行批评和自我批评与如何教育和提高落后工人提供了正确的经验。他们的办法是：一、具体地了解工人的思想问题，并针对这种思想问题，进行说服教育工作；二、具体地了解工人生活上的各种问题，并帮助工人解决这些问题；三、让工人用和先进人物实行“思想对照”的办法检讨自己，学习先进工人的榜样；四、找到落后群众中的典型人物，加以耐心说服和热诚帮助，使他改造自己，向先进工人看齐，然后再用他提高觉悟的经验，去推动其他有落后思想的工人向前进步。事实已经证明，他们的这种方法是最能引导全体工人自觉地前进的。而工人的这种自觉的积极性才是完成一切生产计划的最可靠的保证。各地都应学习这一方法，避免和克服那种简单粗暴的工作方法。
    应当指出，不但在厂矿中，而且在农村的群众宣传工作中，也存在着这种简单粗暴的作法，甚至可以说是表现得更严重些。这在关于农村合作互助的宣传工作中可以看得最明显。有些农村的宣传员在宣传互助合作时，不懂得如何宣传互助合作的优越性，以便吸引农民自觉地参加互助组及农业生产合作社，而是错误地打击单干户，甚至荒谬地宣传单干就是“不爱国”，是走“蒋介石和美帝的道路”。这些荒谬的和错误的宣传在有些地方已引起不良影响。今后各地都应加强对宣传员的教育，认真防止此种不良现象的继续发生。
