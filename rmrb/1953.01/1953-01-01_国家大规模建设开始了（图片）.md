    National Large-Scale Construction Begins
    Our great motherland's first five-year economic construction plan begins this year. In order to ensure the timely completion of this glorious and arduous construction task, tens of thousands of outstanding cadres are being transferred from various production departments to basic construction departments in order to rapidly strengthen the basic construction force. This is the scene of workers at the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant warmly sending off the cadres who have been transferred to participate in basic construction work. (Manuscript from Shanxi Daily)
    Planfully strengthening winter training for permanent workers can cultivate the backbone of basic construction and improve workers' political awareness and technical level. This is a technician from the mechanics team winter training class of the Harbin No. 5 Engineering Office. He is explaining the structure and usage of a five-ton crane to the permanent workers receiving winter training. (Photo by Zheng Guanghua, People's Pictorial)

    In order to cultivate a large number of talents for large-scale construction, many completely new types of higher industrial schools and short-term training courses have been established in important areas of our country. This is the scene of second-year students from the Mining Department of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel conducting mineral practice. (Photo by Zhang Li, this newspaper)
    Thanks to the selfless help and enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, Chinese workers have generally learned advanced Soviet experience and mastered many scientific technologies. At this construction site, Soviet electrical expert Zovgorodny is guiding Chinese workers in inspecting machinery. (Photo by Cai Shangxiong, People's Pictorial)
    The mechanized woodworking factory affiliated to the Harbin No. 5 Engineering Office of the Construction Engineering Company of the Central Heavy Industry Department produces finished products such as windows and doors according to uniform specifications and transports them to various construction sites in large quantities.

    With the start of large-scale national construction, the transportation industry will also be greatly developed. This is the scene of surveying work being carried out before the construction of the new Fengtai-Shacheng section of railway, the most difficult railway construction project in the country.

    Design work is an extremely important part of national basic construction. Our country has now gathered a large number of designers who are stepping up design work. These are the designers of the Fourth Design Group of the Design Company affiliated to the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government, who are working intensively on engineering design.

    A large amount of timber from the Northeast Forest Area supports the country's large-scale construction and is continuously transported to construction sites across the country. This is a tractor team transporting timber. (Photo by Zhang Ming)
    The help of the great friendship of the Soviet Union is an indispensable and extremely important condition for our country's large-scale construction. This is a giant transformer provided by the Soviet Union to support our country. Workers are installing it on the construction site. (Photo by Cai Shangxiong, People's Pictorial)
    In order to support national large-scale construction, many state-owned and private enterprises across the country are stepping up the completion of state orders. This is the scene of workers at a private motor factory installing engine coils. (Photo by Yu Jiazhen, Tianjin Daily)
    In order not to delay the progress of construction, a large number of materials are transported to the construction site before construction. (Photo by Zhang Li, this newspaper)

    国家大规模建设开始了
    我们伟大祖国第一个五年经济建设计划从今年起开始实行了。为了保证及时完成这个光荣而繁重的建设任务，成千成万优秀的干部正从各生产部门抽调到基本建设部门，借以迅速充实基本建设的力量。这是国营太原钢铁厂工人们正在热烈欢送被抽调去参加基本建设工作的干部时的情形。  （山西日报稿）
    有计划地加强固定工人的冬季训练，可以培养基本建设的骨干，提高工人的政治觉悟和技术水平。这是哈尔滨第五工程处机械队工人冬训班的技工。他在给受冬训的固定工人们讲解五吨吊车的构造和使用法。  （人民画报郑光华摄）
    祖国，在毛泽东时代建设起来。  （宣传画）（李琦绘）
    为了给大规模建设培养大批人材，我国各重要地区都建立了许多完全新型的高等工业学校和短期训练班。这是北京钢铁学院采矿系二年级同学在作矿物实习时的情形。    （本报张力摄）
    由于苏联专家无私的帮助和热情的指导，我国工人普遍地学习了苏联先进经验，掌握了许多科学技术。在这个工地上，苏联电气专家卓夫格罗德尼正在指导我国工人们检查机器。 （人民画报蔡尚雄摄）

    随着国家大规模建设的开始，交通运输事业也将大大地发展起来。这是全国目前铁路修筑工程中最艰难的丰（台）沙（城）段新线铁路施工前正在进行勘察工作的情形。  （本报张力摄）
    设计工作是国家基本建设中的一项极重要的工作。现在我们国家已经集结了大批设计人员，加紧进行设计。这是中央人民政府建筑工程部所属设计公司第四设计组的设计人员，他们在紧张地进行工程设计。  （人民画报郑光华摄）
    东北林区支援国家大规模建设的大批木材，源源运往全国各个建设工地，这是运输木材的拖拉机队。  （张明摄）
    苏联伟大友谊的帮助，是我们国家大规模建设不可缺少的极其重要的条件。这是苏联支援我国的巨型变压器。工人们正在工地上进行安装工作。  （人民画报蔡尚雄摄）
    为了支援国家大规模建设，全国许多国营、私营企业单位都在加紧完成国家的订货任务。这是一个私营电机厂的工人正在安装发动机线圈时的情形。  （天津日报于嘉桢摄）
    为了不耽误施工进度，大批材料在施工前就运到了工地。（本报张力摄）
