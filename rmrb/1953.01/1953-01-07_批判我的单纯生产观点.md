    Criticizing My Pure Production Viewpoint
    Huang Mobin, Director of Tianjin Steel Plant
    In November 1952, I attended the National Factory and Mine Directors Conference convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry. I studied Director Chen Yun's instructions and the People's Daily editorial "Put Capital Construction in the Primary Position." I listened to Minister Wang Heshou's report, which greatly changed my understanding of capital construction.
    In the past, my pure production viewpoint was very serious. I didn't understand that a production factory should not only continuously improve production to supply the country's daily needs but also directly and indirectly serve the capital construction of each period, especially to prepare forces and create conditions for large-scale construction. For example, our factory was taken over from the enemy and puppets, old and dilapidated, and the equipment was extremely unbalanced. Logically, this was an old factory that didn't need to be expanded. But because we didn't understand the integrity of national construction, we blindly placed "unlimited" hopes on it, and always hoped that the higher authorities would give us more money for repairs; if the higher authorities didn't give or gave less, we would feel uncomfortable; if the state decided that our factory was not a key investment, we wouldn't be very motivated; every time we discussed capital construction projects and investments, I would always argue endlessly. However, in reality, we spent a lot of money on unimportant work; some was even spent incorrectly, causing serious losses.
    Secondly, due to short-sightedness, only seeing the local interests of production, we didn't pay enough attention to squeezing out strength, especially continuously cultivating strength, to support capital construction and new enterprises. For example, in the past, for certain capital construction orders, we could have allocated some strength to do them, but we were afraid of disrupting the factory's plan and affecting production, so we tried our best to decline them. Furthermore, we were also very conservative in the work of training cadres and technicians, only focusing on the needs of our own unit and doing some work; we rarely thought that we should vigorously cultivate new forces and continuously send them out to meet the needs of large-scale national construction and the needs of countless new enterprises in the future. In the past, I worked in Tangshan Steel Plant for two years, and I also did a lot of piecemeal construction projects at that time, but I never cultivated a group of technical backbones. The reason was that at that time, I thought that the factory didn't have many capital construction tasks and didn't need to cultivate any fixed forces. Due to this narrow and conservative thinking, whenever the higher authorities wanted to transfer people, we emphasized difficulties and bargained. When we finally had to obey the transfer, we were full of complaints.
    In the past few years, I have been indifferent to the factory's repair and expansion projects. Because of the lack of strong leadership, these projects have always adopted handicraft-style and guerrilla-style working methods, and have never created any experience. And because I have not been deeply involved in this area of work, I have not felt the complexity and difficulty of capital construction. It can be said that I completely lacked knowledge in this area.
    After listening to the report and studying the documents this time, I realized the harm of the pure production viewpoint. Minister Wang Heshou pointed out to us: Production is only a part of the entire industrial development. If we don't quickly build many new, modern, large-scale factories and mines, it is impossible to change our country's backward situation and achieve industrialization by simply improving existing production factories and mines. That's indeed the case. In the past, I didn't connect production with capital construction, didn't connect the part with the whole, the present with the long-term, and couldn't distinguish the primary from the secondary, so I only wanted more money, less transfer of cadres, and indifference to capital construction work. Now I think that on the eve of the country's imminent large-scale construction, the leading cadres of every production enterprise must make a fundamental change in their thinking. Any thought that ignores the importance and complexity of capital construction, any partial view that ignores the direct and indirect relationship between production and capital construction, will make oneself abandon one's own responsibility, leading to serious mistakes. We should immediately take active actions and transfer the most elite forces from the production departments to the capital construction departments.
    If we do this, some people will inevitably ask: Will it ruin production? At first, I was not very reassured, but after listening to the experience of the Northeast, especially the example of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and thinking carefully about my own work experience in the factory over the past few years, and considering that our factory has undergone several major political movements and production movements, the mass base is good, the technical level has been generally improved, and the factory management also has a considerable foundation, I deeply realized that transferring cadres and technicians from the production departments to the capital construction departments will never ruin production. The only problem is that we must conscientiously implement the policy of relying on the working class to manage the factory well, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promote our own advanced experience; we must resolutely oppose conservative thinking in the cadre policy, and let go of cultivating new forces, especially to pay attention to cultivating and promoting from outstanding workers and young intellectuals.
    Today, the country's large-scale capital construction has begun. I have thoroughly cleared away my pure production viewpoint and am ready to have the most elite forces ready to be transferred.

    批判我的单纯生产观点
    天津钢厂厂长  黄墨滨
    一九五二年十一月份，我参加重工业部召开的全国厂矿长会议，学习了陈云主任的指示和人民日报“把基本建设放在首要地位”的社论，听了王鹤寿部长的报告，使我对基本建设的认识有了很大的转变。
    过去，我的单纯生产观点很严重。我不懂得生产的工厂不仅要为供给国家日常需要而不断提高生产，同时还要直接、间接地为每个时期的基本建设服务，特别是要为大规模建设准备力量和创造条件。譬如，我们工厂是从敌伪手中接收过来的，陈旧残破，设备极不平衡。按理说，这是一个不必扩大的旧工厂。但由于我们不懂得国家建设的整体性，盲目地对它寄予了“无限”发展的希望，就总希望上级多给些钱修修补补；假如上级不给或给少了，心里就不舒服；国家决定本厂不是投资重点，干的劲头就不大；每次讨论基本建设项目和投资时，我总是哓哓地争个不休。但是，实际上我们把不少钱花在了不重要的工作上；有的甚至花错了，造成了严重的损失。
    其次，由于眼光不远，只看到局部的生产上的利害，对于挤出力量，特别是不断培养力量来支援基本建设，支援新的企业，就重视得不够。例如过去我们对于某些基本建设方面的订货，本来可以调配一些力量来做，但是怕打乱本厂的计划，影响生产，就尽量谢绝了。再如，我们对培养干部和技术工人的工作也是很保守的，只是从本单位需要着眼，做了一些工作；很少想到应该大力培养新生的力量，源源不断地向外输送，以满足国家大规模建设的需要和将来无数新企业的需要。过去我在唐山钢厂工作过两年，那时也做过不少的零星建设工程，但始终没有培养出一批技术上的骨干。其原因就是当时自以为本厂基本建设任务不多，不需要培养什么固定力量。由于存在着这种狭隘的保守的思想，于是每当上级要调人时，就强调困难，讨价还价。最后不得不服从调动时，便满腹牢骚。
    过去几年中，我对工厂的修复、扩充工程是漠视的。因为缺乏有力的领导，这些工程一直是采用手工业式和游击式的工作方法，始终没有创造出什么经验来。而我自己由于没有深入地接触这方面的工作，就没有感觉到基本建设的复杂和艰巨，也可以说，完全缺乏这方面的知识。
    这次听了报告，学习了文件，我才认识到单纯生产观点的危害。王鹤寿部长对我们指出：生产在整个工业发展中不过是个局部。如果不很快建立许多新的现代化的大型工厂和矿井，单靠提高现有的生产厂矿，是不可能改变我们国家的落后状况，不可能达到工业化的。的确是这样。我过去就是没有把生产和基本建设联系起来，没有把局部与整体，目前与长远联系起来，不能分清主次，所以才只想多要钱，少输送干部和漠视基本建设工作。现在我认为，在国家即将展开大规模建设的前夜，每一个生产企业的领导干部必须在思想上作根本的转变。任何忽视基本建设的重要性、复杂性的思想，任何漠视生产与基本建设的直接、间接关系的局部观点，都将使自己放弃切身的责任，以致造成严重的错误。我们应该立刻采取积极的行动，从生产部门抽调最精锐的力量，输送到基本建设部门去。
    如果这样做了，难免有人要问：会不会把生产搞垮呢？我起先也不很放心，但听了东北的经验，特别是鞍山钢铁公司的实例，再仔细想一想自己几年来在工厂里工作经过情形，想到我们的工厂经过几次大的政治运动和生产运动，群众基础是好的，技术水平已普遍提高，工厂管理也有了相当的基础，便深深体会到从生产部门抽调干部和技术工人到基本建设部门去，生产是绝不会垮的。问题只在于：必须认真贯彻依靠工人阶级管好工厂的方针，学习苏联先进经验和推广自己的先进经验；必须坚决反对在干部政策上的保守思想，要放手培养新的力量，特别是要重视从优秀的工人和青年知识分子中培养提拔。
    今天，国家大规模的基本建设开始了，我彻底清扫了自己的单纯生产观点，已准备好最精锐的力量听候抽调。
