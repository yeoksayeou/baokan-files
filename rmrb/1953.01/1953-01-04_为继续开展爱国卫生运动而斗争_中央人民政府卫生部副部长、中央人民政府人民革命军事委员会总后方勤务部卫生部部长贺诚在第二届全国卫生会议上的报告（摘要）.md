I. The Situation of the Patriotic Health Campaign in 1952

Since January 1952, when American imperialism launched bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, the people of the whole country, under the call of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, have launched a vigorous patriotic health campaign. This movement has achieved great victories, not only smashing the conspiracy of American imperialism but also educating the broad masses to pay attention to hygiene, improving the level of health work, and accelerating the construction of China's health cause. The achievements of this movement are unprecedented in the history of China's health work.

During the patriotic health campaign, many model units and model individuals emerged throughout the country. They played a leading role in the movement, created many valuable experiences, and became a strong pillar for promoting health work in various places.

At the same time as launching the patriotic health campaign, we carried out scientific research work against bacteriological warfare. The country's outstanding entomologists, bacteriologists, pathologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, pharmacologists, agricultural scientists, and veterinarians were organized under the task of scientific research work against bacteriological warfare. Some of these experts also organized volunteer epidemic prevention and inspection teams and set off for Korea. All these experts worked with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and a realistic scientific attitude, and victoriously completed the task of exposing the enemy's crimes and helping to smash bacteriological warfare. Our scientific experts have made great contributions to safeguarding the people's health and defending world peace.

However, the development of our movement is still very uneven. Generally speaking, large cities and railway lines are better than other places, cities are generally better than rural areas, and plains areas with convenient transportation in rural areas are generally better than mountainous areas; residents and troops are better than government agencies, factories, and schools. The patriotic health campaign has both concentrated activities and regular activities. Generally, concentrated activities are done better, and regular activities are done worse. Some places have coercive command styles in carrying out the movement; individual places have formalism and extravagance. These are all issues that must be addressed and improved in future work.

II. The Experience of the Patriotic Health Campaign

Now, taking some model health units as examples, we will introduce their experiences and analyze them.

A. Experience in Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign in Cities

After studying the experiences of five cities—Beijing, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanhaiguan, and Fushun—we believe that the following points are worth promoting:

First, unified leadership and district-based responsibility. Some of the institutions, schools, and enterprises in the city administratively belong to the city, and some belong to higher-level authorities, but when carrying out the patriotic health campaign, the city must provide unified leadership and divide responsibilities by region, not by administrative system, in order to ensure unified steps and jointly do a good job in health work. To achieve this, it is very important for the higher-level authorities of the administrative system to ensure that their subordinate units obey the leadership of the residential district. After each citywide inspection, the Beijing Municipal Health Committee reports the inspection results to each administrative system, which supports it and urges its subordinate units, which has played a significant role. According to the experience of several cities, the district health committee is led by the director of the local police station, which makes it very easy to promote health work.

Second, repeated mobilization and organization of large-scale publicity. Taking Beijing as an example, the citywide mobilization meeting was held as many as six times, and cadre meetings were held before each meeting. The mayor and deputy mayor personally presided over the meetings, clearly pointing out that the patriotic health campaign is one of the current central tasks. This has made the patriotic health campaign penetrate the entire city. Nanjing organized a publicity army, adopting more than 20 forms of publicity, and conducting door-to-door publicity; from June to September 1952, Nanjing newspapers published more than 300 articles on the patriotic health campaign. For example, Shanhaiguan City had more than 40 publicity methods. According to the experience of several cities, organizing small exhibitions and conducting physical publicity has a great effect.

Third, focus on construction and transformation, first focusing on areas with the worst sanitary conditions. For example, Beijing transformed the Dragon Beard Ditch into an underground sewer and thoroughly renovated the Taoranting and Longtan areas; Nanjing dredged the 30-mile Qinhuai River, and so on. This not only provided residents in these areas with a good sanitary environment but also promoted the citywide patriotic health campaign. It proves that it is a very correct policy to carry out urban sanitation projects in accordance with the principle of "spending less money and accomplishing big things," combined with the mass patriotic health campaign.

Fourth, to eliminate disease-carrying insects, we must first rely on the masses and improve environmental sanitation, while also carrying out swatting; drug-based insect control should only be placed in a secondary position. According to Beijing's experience, the virtual elimination of flies in the city is mainly due to the promotion of Li Ligeng's method of digging fly pupae, creating a craze for digging fly pupae, while moving manure yards and bone scraping industries outside the city and prohibiting pig raising in the city, and then mobilizing city residents to swat adult flies. Drug-based insect control is only carried out in key areas. Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanhaiguan, and Fushun also rely on the power of the masses to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, without relying on drugs, or even without using drugs at all.

Fifth, sanitary management of the catering industry is one of the main measures to reduce gastrointestinal infectious diseases. Fushun does the best in the management of food vending. Their main method is to organize scattered vendors, help them establish systems, and inspect each other. There are no longer any mobile vendors in Fushun. The common experience of various cities is to give food vendors with good hygiene awards or red flags, which greatly increases the number of customers of the food vendor. This is one of the good ways to promote hygiene in the food industry.

B. Experience in Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign in Rural Areas

In rural areas, we studied the experiences of Taihe Village in Yanji County, Jilin Province, Shang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, Yangtang Township in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, Yuyu Village in the Miao Autonomous Region of Damo Mountain, Guangxi Province, and Gangshang Village in Yexian County, (former) Pingyuan Province, in carrying out the patriotic health campaign.

First, when conducting health propaganda, cite real people and real events, and do not talk empty words. Or hold bitterness-telling meetings, telling about the pain of being unable to pay attention to hygiene in the old society. Calculating detailed accounts to prove that paying attention to hygiene is beneficial is also a good method.

Second, cadres set an example, and cadres take the lead in doing things that everyone is unwilling to do. For example, Tan Zhongzhi (Communist Party member), director of the Shang Village Farmers' Association, drove his own cart to haul soil for the villagers to whitewash their houses; Zheng Daojun, the branch secretary of Taihe Village, in order to encourage everyone to practice separating people and livestock, first tied his own cattle outside the house.

Third, from shallow to deep, start with things that are easiest for the masses to accept. For example, when the health work team of the Miao Autonomous Region of Damo Mountain came to Yuyu Village, they first treated patients, and while treating them, they promoted hygiene; then they convened cadres, women, and children's league members to hold meetings and mobilize everyone to carry out cleaning; after everyone understood the benefits of cleanliness, they mobilized everyone to catch mice, kill flies, and cut bamboo heads to prevent water accumulation and mosquito breeding; finally, they mobilized everyone to dig wells, build toilets, dredge ditches, and repair roads.

Fourth, the patriotic health campaign must be combined with agricultural production. In Yangtang Township, the comrades leading production and the comrades leading the patriotic health campaign each did their own thing at first, resulting in the masses reflecting that there were too many meetings and delaying production; later, the district decided to organize production and hygiene in a unified way, with unified planning, unified deployment, and unified inspection, and the situation changed greatly. In 1952, Gangshang Village originally planned to increase fertilizer accumulation by 1,150 carts compared with 1951. After carrying out the health campaign, as of October 1952, it had accumulated 1,050 carts more than in 1951, and it is estimated that by the end of 1952, it would accumulate nearly 2,000 carts more than in 1951. Before the patriotic health campaign, 40% of the households in Shang Village participated in production mutual aid groups; after carrying out the health campaign, due to the organization of the masses who had not participated in production mutual aid groups into many health mutual aid groups, many health mutual aid groups later became production mutual aid groups. Now, 95% of the households in Shang Village participate in production mutual aid groups. They also implemented the method of "combined toilet for fertilizer distribution" and "combined stable for fertilizer distribution." The village's fertilizer in 1952 increased by one-third compared with 1951. In the past, passers-by in the village defecated everywhere, but now there are public toilets, the streets are clean, and more fertilizer is accumulated. Taihe Village originally had no toilets, but now it has built hundreds of toilets. In the past, people and cattle lived together, but now there are cowsheds. As a result, fertilizer accumulation has increased. The village accumulated 1,400 carts of human manure in 1952, which was not available in the past. In 1952, the average yield per hectare was 2,400 jin of rice more than in 1951.

Fifth, through the method of everyone's cooperation, the goal of both hygiene and economy can be achieved. For example, in the past, men in Taihe Village went to the city to take a bath, which cost about 10,000 yuan including meals, and women could not take a bath at all. Now, the village has established a bathhouse, organizing everyone to bathe, with women bathing in the morning and men bathing in the afternoon, three times a month. The bathhouse was drawn from the club, the construction cost was about 1.5 million yuan, which was shared by everyone according to their ability, and the regular expenses were also shared by everyone according to their ability. Now, the average cost per person per bath is only 100 yuan.

C. Experience in Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign in Factories and Mines

The patriotic health campaign in 1952 was generally not well carried out in factories and mines. The main reason is that many factories still lack experience in combining hygiene, safety, and production, and have insufficient understanding of the principle of relying on mass movements for health work, so they often regard the patriotic health campaign as an extra burden. In fact, the patriotic health campaign will not only not hinder the completion of production tasks but will also enhance production efficiency. For example, since the launch of the patriotic health campaign, the canteen of the Shenyang Woolen Mill has improved, and the workers no longer eat at food stalls. The garbage was cleared, a sports field was built, and the workers' sports activities became active. Families no longer raise pigs, and the bricks from the pigpens were used to repair roads, making it easier to walk. A system of cleaning before work and "People's Health Day" was established, and the workshops inside and outside can be kept clean. As a result, the incidence of illness among workers decreased month by month, and the incidence of illness in August 1952 decreased by 30% compared with March of the same year. The factory completed the production plan for the second quarter of 1952 six days ahead of schedule, with an increase in production and savings exceeding 26%. For example, since the launch of the patriotic health campaign, the sanitation of the Wuxi Tianyuan Textile Factory has been greatly improved due to the removal of garbage, the filling of sewage pits, and the carrying out of mosquito and fly control; in the past, there were many mosquitoes in the workshop, which hindered production, but now there are none. The number of workers suffering from malaria has also decreased significantly compared with 1951.

D. Experience in Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign on Railways

The main experiences in carrying out the patriotic health campaign on railways are: First, traffic quarantine work must be combined with traffic and transportation business, which requires emphasizing scientific management methods. Second, railways and local areas must closely cooperate and work together. At important stations, railways and local areas can organize unified leading organizations for the patriotic health campaign. For example, Shanhaiguan City has achieved great results in carrying out the patriotic health campaign, which is the result of the joint efforts of railways and local areas. Third, it is necessary to conduct meticulous health publicity and education for passengers so that every railway worker can do health publicity work. Some places have implemented the "passenger representative system," mobilizing passengers to keep the car clean, which is a good method. Fourth, establish a zoning and sectional cleaning responsibility system at the station, conduct universal health checks for food vendors, and implement strict management.

During the patriotic health campaign, it was very correct for us to focus on railway traffic hygiene as one of the key tasks.

E. Experience in Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign in the Military

According to the experience of several model health units in the military, the main reasons why the patriotic health campaign has achieved success are: First, military and political leaders attach importance to it. For example, Ren Sizhong, political commissar of a certain division of the Central South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, educated all cadres with the idea that "health work is a concrete manifestation of the concept of loving soldiers" and personally arranged health work at party meetings and administrative meetings; The group leaders of a certain auto group of the Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army convened all leading cadres and health personnel to study the health work instructions of the military region, and said: "Doing a good job in the health work of the troops is a criterion for assessing cadres"; The administrative leaders, branch leaders, and doctors of the Yellow River troops of the Chinese People's Navy are responsible for checking every meal. Second, the patriotic health campaign is combined with the central tasks of the troops. For example, the model health units of the Chinese People's Volunteers combine the patriotic health campaign well with combat missions; the model health units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army combine the patriotic health campaign well with cultural learning. In addition, the promotion effect of the troops carrying out the patriotic health campaign well on the residents is also extremely great.

Generally speaking, the general experiences of the 1952 patriotic health campaign are:

First, it must be recognized that the promotion of health work cannot be accomplished solely by health personnel, and health work must be combined with mass movements in order to develop. The reason why the patriotic health campaign has achieved such great results is that leaders at all levels are responsible, with health personnel as the backbone, and the broad masses are mobilized. The patriotic health campaign has found the only correct method for us to promote health work. On the other hand, the patriotic health campaign must have the guidance of health science in order to be carried out step by step and purposefully and to continuously improve.

Second, all relevant departments—health departments, cultural and educational propaganda departments, public security departments, transportation departments, industrial departments, agricultural departments, water conservancy departments, and various mass organizations, etc.—must cooperate. Women are a great force in carrying out the patriotic health campaign among urban and rural residents. In the future, local health departments should strengthen contact with women's organizations.

Third, the patriotic health campaign must be combined with production tasks and other current tasks, and the patriotic health campaign should be regarded as one of the important conditions for ensuring the completion of production or other current tasks. It is wrong to emphasize production and ignore health, and it is also wrong to carry out health work without taking into account the specific situation of the production department.

Fourth, attention must be paid to work inspection. The achievements of all regions and units where the patriotic health campaign is carried out well are inseparable from repeated and in-depth inspections. Setting up special inspection agencies in health committees at the city and county levels or above, and temporarily organizing inspection teams to conduct regular inspections and summarize experiences, this practice should continue to be adopted in the future. Some areas do not carefully analyze the reports from below, and do not inspect the actual situation before forwarding them to higher-level authorities. This bureaucratic style should be corrected.

Fifth, the elimination of disease-carrying insects should start with the improvement of environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, including cleaning up garbage, dredging ditches, filling low-lying areas, blocking tree holes, treating feces, treating sewage, and advocating frequent washing of clothes and bathing, etc., and gradually proceed according to certain conditions. For the direct swatting of disease-carrying insects, the practice of "early, small, and thorough" should be implemented. In order to reduce gastrointestinal infectious diseases, in addition to fly control, we must also focus on improving drinking water and managing the food industry, especially food manufacturing. Some places only focus on swatting mosquitoes and flies without focusing on improving environmental sanitation; or only focus on indoor and outdoor cleaning and fly control without focusing on improving drinking water and managing the food industry; or only focus on managing food vending without focusing on managing food manufacturing. These all need to be improved.

Sixth, we must be good at grasping the two forms of concentrated activities and regular activities in the movement, and coordinate them with each other. Without concentrated activities, it is not easy to mobilize the masses universally. Without regular activities, the achievements cannot be consolidated and the movement cannot continue to be deepened. Concentrated activities are the beginning of regular activities, and regular activities are the continuation of concentrated activities.

III. The Guiding Principles and Tasks for Continuing the Patriotic Health Campaign in 1953

The patriotic health campaign in 1952 has already achieved results. Is it still necessary to continue the patriotic health campaign in 1953? The Central People's Government has decided that the patriotic health campaign must be continued. This is because:

First, American imperialism is still continuing its war of aggression against Korea, and is still conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China; if we do not continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign, we will be fooled.

Second, although our sanitary conditions have improved, they are still far from the required requirements. Although the 1952 patriotic health campaign has created some model health areas and units, in terms of quantity, it is still too small compared with China's vast area; and in terms of quality, the level they have reached is not high enough, especially the patriotic health campaign in factories and mines is generally carried out relatively poorly, which is extremely inconsistent with China's construction tasks. We must never stay at the current stage of the movement.

Third, our health foundation is still very poor, and the strength of the health department itself is still very weak. Strengthening the foundation of health work through a mass patriotic health campaign should be a long-term task for us.

The general tasks of the 1953 patriotic health campaign are still to oppose American bacteriological warfare, clear up mosquito and fly breeding grounds, catch and kill disease-carrying animals, and popularize health knowledge.

(1) Continue to carry out education against bacteriological warfare and strengthen measures against bacteriological warfare.

(2) Require a more widespread filling of sewage pits and dredging of clogged ditches. Clean up garbage at any time, and try to move manure yards in large and small cities to the suburbs. Pay attention to building and improving toilets and livestock pens. Mosquito and fly control should start with killing maggots, pupae, and mosquito larvae. Pay attention to improving and protecting water sources.

(3) Continue to mobilize the masses to catch mice, and in areas where plague has occurred, mice should be thoroughly caught.

(4) Educate and help the masses to thoroughly kill lice.

(5) Mobilize a large number of people to conduct health publicity and education in various forms, with the prevention knowledge of local and seasonal diseases, labor health and maternal and child health knowledge, and the introduction of the experience of the patriotic health campaign as the main content of publicity and education.

(6) Create more model health areas, model health units, and model health individuals. For existing models, attention should be paid to consolidation and helping them to develop better. Reward all health-promoting creations and inventions that are suitable for local conditions.

Secondly, in different areas, in addition to the above-mentioned tasks, there should also be different priorities:

(1) Cities - Special emphasis should be placed on the hygiene of the food industry, the sanitation industry (barber shops, bathhouses), and public entertainment venues. These industries and venues are required to thoroughly do a good job in environmental sanitation. It is required that food from manufacturing to sales fully meet the conditions of cleanliness and hygiene. It is required that slaughtered livestock be completely disease-free and that the meat sold be completely fresh. Personnel in the food industry and sanitation industry should pay attention to personal hygiene. Health authorities in various cities should organize these personnel to give them health training, and may try to conduct health checks on these personnel. In addition to the above general requirements, government agencies, groups, and schools should pay special attention to the hygiene of kitchens, canteens, toilets, and bathrooms, and conduct hygiene training for cooks.

(2) Factories and Mines - The cleaning and hygiene work of kitchens, canteens, toilets, and bathrooms should be done well, safety facilities and ventilation equipment in workshops, workshops, and mines should be improved, and other occupational health conditions should be improved according to specific circumstances to prevent occupational diseases.

(3) Rural Areas - Focus should be placed on manure treatment and improvement of drinking water. Manure fermentation methods can be widely implemented. The method of combined toilet for fertilizer distribution and combined stable for fertilizer distribution should be promoted. In places where wells can be dug but have not been dug, the masses should be mobilized to dig wells. In places where wells cannot be dug and river water must be drunk, it should be advocated to establish simple water filter ponds. In places where there is still a habit of people and animals living together, it should be advocated to separate people and animals. In places where there are no bathhouses, it should be advocated to establish bathhouses. In places where there are endemic diseases, it is particularly necessary to mobilize the broad masses to fight to prevent endemic diseases.

(4) Transportation Lines - Universal cleaning of large and small stations and wharf terminals should be done. Strengthen national border traffic quarantine work. It should be ensured that the prescribed hygiene regulations are thoroughly implemented in trains and ships.

(5) Troops - Various health systems of the troops should be thoroughly implemented, and environmental hygiene and personal hygiene should be completely done well.

In the spring of 1953, a short-term patriotic health blitz should be carried out throughout the country in order to eliminate disease-carrying insects as soon as possible and lay the foundation for the annual patriotic health campaign.

In order to ensure the smooth conduct of the 1953 patriotic health campaign, the leading authorities of the patriotic health campaign in various places should, before the end of January 1953, formulate specific plans for the 1953 patriotic health campaign in their local areas in accordance with the above-mentioned points and based on the experience of 1952, which should include specific requirements and figures for improving environmental sanitation, catching and killing disease-carrying animals, etc., as well as the figures for striving to create new model units.

We must absorb the many experiences of carrying out the patriotic health campaign in 1952 and prepare to achieve greater victories in 1953 on the basis of existing victories. We must ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions: "Mobilize, pay attention to hygiene, reduce diseases, improve health standards, and smash the enemy's bacteriological warfare."

    为继续开展爱国卫生运动而斗争
    ——中央人民政府卫生部副部长、中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总后方勤务部卫生部部长贺诚在第二届全国卫生会议上的报告（摘要）
    一、一九五二年开展爱国卫生运动的情况
    自一九五二年一月间，美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战以来，我全国人民在中央人民政府和毛主席的号召下，开展了轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动。这个运动，已经取得了伟大的胜利，不仅粉碎了美帝国主义的阴谋毒计，而且教育了广大人民起来讲究卫生，提高了卫生工作的水平，加速了我国卫生事业的建设。这个运动所获得的成就之大，在我国卫生工作历史上是空前未有的。
    在爱国卫生运动中间，全国各地出现了很多的模范单位和模范人物。他们在运动中起了带头作用，创造了许多宝贵的经验，成为各地推行卫生工作的有力的支柱。
    与开展爱国卫生运动的同时，我们进行了反细菌战的科学研究工作。全国优秀的昆虫学家、细菌学家、病理学家、流行病学家、临床医学家、药物学家、农业学家、兽医学家在反细菌战科学研究工作的任务下，组织起来了。其中一部分专家并且组织了志愿防疫检验队，出发到朝鲜去了。所有这些专家们以高度的爱国热情和实事求是的科学态度工作着，胜利地完成了揭露敌人罪行和帮助粉碎细菌战的任务。我们这些科学专家们在保障人民健康和保卫世界和平事业上，作了巨大的贡献。
    但是，我们的运动发展还很不平衡。大体上是大城市和铁路沿线比较其他地方好些，城市一般比农村好些，农村中交通方便的平原地区又一般比山区好些；居民和部队比较机关、工厂、学校好些。爱国卫生运动有突击性的活动和经常性的活动，一般突击性活动做得较好，经常性活动做得较差。有些地方在开展运动过程中有强迫命令作风；个别地方有形式主义和铺张浪费现象。这些，都是在今后工作中必须注意解决和改进的。
    二、爱国卫生运动的经验
    现在，我们以一部分卫生模范单位为例，将它们的经验介绍出来，并加以分析。
    甲、在城市中开展爱国卫生运动的经验
    我们研究了北京、南京、青岛、山海关、抚顺五个城市的经验，认为有以下几点经验值得推广：
    第一、统一领导，分区负责。城市的机关、学校、企业在行政上有些属本市，有些属上级机关，但在开展爱国卫生运动时，必须由市统一领导，按区域划分负责范围，而不按行政系统划分负责范围，才能步调一致，共同把卫生工作做好。为了做到这一点，行政系统的上级机关保证所属单位服从住在区的领导是很重要的。北京市卫生委员会每于进行全市检查之后，将检查结果报告各行政系统，各行政系统即加以支持，并对所属单位进行督促，这样起了很大作用。根据几个城市的经验，区卫生委员会由派出所所长负责领导，卫生工作非常易于推动。
    第二、反复动员，并组织大规模的宣传。以北京为例，全市性的动员大会前后开了六次之多，每次大会之前都开干部会议，大会和干部会都由市长、副市长亲自主持，明确指出爱国卫生运动是当前中心工作之一。这样就使爱国卫生运动深入全市。南京市组织了宣传大军，采取二十多种宣传形式，挨户宣传；从一九五二年六月到九月，南京的报纸刊载爱国卫生运动稿件达三百多篇。又如山海关市，宣传方式达四十余种。根据几个城市的经验，组织小型展览会，进行实物宣传，效果很大。
    第三、重点建设，重点改造，首先着眼于卫生状况最差的区域。例如：北京市把龙须沟改为地下水道，把陶然亭、龙潭地区加以彻底修整；南京把三十里的秦淮河加以疏浚等等。这不仅使这些地带的居民有了良好的卫生环境，而且推动了全市爱国卫生运动。证明在城市卫生工程实施上，根据“花钱少，办大事”的原则，结合群众性的爱国卫生运动来进行，是非常正确的方针。
    第四、消灭病媒昆虫，首先要依靠群众，改善环境卫生，同时进行扑打；药物杀虫只放在辅助的地位。据北京的经验，做到市内苍蝇几乎绝迹，主要是由于推广了李力耕的挖蝇蛹方法，造成挖蝇蛹热潮，同时将粪场和刮骨血料行业迁到城外，并禁止在城内养猪，然后动员全市居民进行扑打成虫。药物杀虫仅仅是重点进行。南京市、青岛市、山海关市和抚顺市也都是依靠群众力量消灭了蚊蝇的，并不依赖药物，甚至完全没有用药物。
    第五、饮食行业的卫生管理是减少肠胃传染病的主要措施之一。对食品贩卖业的管理，抚顺做得最好。他们的主要方法是把分散的摊贩组织起来，帮助他们建立制度，互相检查。抚顺全市现已经没有流动小贩出现。各城市的共同经验，是给卫生搞得好的食品商以奖牌或红旗，因而使该食品商的顾客大大增加。这是推动食品行业卫生的好办法之一。
    乙、在农村中开展爱国卫生运动的经验
    在农村方面，我们研究了吉林省延吉县太兴村，陕西省长安县尚村，湖南省衡山县洋塘乡，广西省大苗山苗族自治区雨玉村和（原）平原省邺县岗上村开展爱国卫生运动的经验。
    第一、进行卫生宣传时，举出真人真事，不说空话。或者开诉苦会，诉说在旧社会无法讲卫生的痛苦。算细帐证明讲卫生有利，也是好办法。
    第二、干部以身作则，大家不肯做的，干部先带头做。如尚村的农会主任谭忠智（共产党员）赶自己的车拉土，供村里人刷房子；太兴村的支部书记郑道俊为带动大家实行人畜分居，他自己先把自己的牛拴到屋外。
    第三、由浅入深，先从群众最容易接受的事情做起。如大苗山苗族自治区卫生工作队到雨玉村工作时，先给病人治病，一面治，一面宣传；然后召集干部们、妇女们、儿童团员们开会，发动大家进行清洁扫除；等大家懂得了清洁的好处之后，再发动大家捕老鼠、灭苍蝇、砍竹头防积水生蚊；最后才动员大家挖水井、修厕所、疏通沟渠、修平道路。
    第四、爱国卫生运动必须与农业生产结合。在洋塘乡先是领导生产和领导爱国卫生运动的同志各搞各的，结果群众反映开会太多，耽误生产；后来区里决定生产与卫生统一组织，统一计划，统一布置，统一检查，情况就大大改变了。岗上村一九五二年原计划积肥比一九五一年增加一千一百五十车，开展卫生运动后，截至一九五二年十月份，已较一九五一年多积肥一千零五十车，预计到一九五二年年底可较一九五一年多积肥近两千车。尚村在爱国卫生运动以前，有百分之四十的户参加了生产互助组；开展爱国卫生运动以后，由于把未参加生产互助组的群众组织成为许多卫生互助组，后来很多卫生互助组也变为生产互助组了。现在，尚村已有百分之九十五的户参加了生产互助组。他们还实行了“合厕分肥”、“合厩分肥”的办法。全村一九五二年的肥料比一九五一年增加了三分之一。过去村上的过路人到处大小便，现在有了公厕，街道清洁了，肥也积多了。太兴村原先没有厕所，现在修了几百个厕所，原先人牛共居，现在有了牛棚。由于这样，积肥增多了。全村一九五二年积人粪一千四百车，是过去没有的。一九五二年平均每垧地比一九五一年多打了二千四百斤稻子。
    第五、通过大家合作的办法达到既讲卫生又能节约的目的。如太兴村过去男人到城里洗澡，一次连吃饭总要花一万元左右，妇女根本无法洗澡。现在村里建立了澡塘，把大家组织起来，午前妇女洗，午后男人洗，每月可以洗三次。澡塘的房子是从俱乐部抽出来的，修建费约一百五十万元，由大家量力分担，经常费也由大家量力分担，现在平均每人洗一次澡才合一百元。
    丙、在工厂矿山开展爱国卫生运动的经验
    一九五二年的爱国卫生运动，在工厂矿山方面一般是开展得不够好的。主要原因是很多厂还缺乏把卫生、保安与生产相结合的经验，并对卫生工作依靠群众运动的方针认识不足，以至往往把爱国卫生运动看做额外的负担。事实上爱国卫生运动不仅不会妨碍生产任务的完成，而且恰足以增强生产的效能。如沈阳毛织厂自爱国卫生运动开展后，食堂改善了，职工们不再到饭摊吃饭了。清除了垃圾，修建了体育场，职工们的体育活动也活跃起来了。各家不再养猪，把猪圈拆下来的砖修了马路，走路也方便了。建立了上班前清扫和“人民卫生日”的制度，车间里外也都能保持清洁了。结果，职工患病率逐月下降，一九五二年八月份的发病率较同年三月份降低了百分之三十。该厂一九五二年第二季度生产计划提前六天完成，增产节约超额百分之二十六以上。又如无锡天元纺织厂自爱国卫生运动开展后，由于清除了垃圾、填平了污水坑，并进行了扑打蚊蝇工作，卫生情况大大改善；过去车间蚊子很多，妨碍生产，现在没有了。职工患疟疾者也较一九五一年显著减少。
    丁、在铁路线开展爱国卫生运动的经验
    在铁路线上开展爱国卫生运动的主要经验是：第一、交通检疫工作必须与交通运输业务相结合，这就需要强调科学的管理方法。第二、铁路与地方必须密切配合，通力合作。在重要站口，铁路与地方可组织统一的爱国卫生运动领导机构。譬如山海关市爱国卫生运动开展得很有成绩，就是铁路与地方共同努力的结果。第三、必须对旅客进行细致的卫生宣传教育，使每个车务人员都会做卫生宣传工作。有的地方实行了“旅客代表制”，发动旅客保持车内清洁，是很好的办法。第四、在车站上建立分区、分片清扫负责制，对饮食贩进行普遍的健康检查，实行严格管理。
    在爱国卫生运动中间，我们以铁路交通卫生为工作重点之一，是非常正确的。
    戊、在部队中开展爱国卫生运动的经验
    根据几个部队卫生模范单位的经验，爱国卫生运动所以获得成绩，主要是由于：第一、军政首长重视。如中国人民解放军中南军区某师政治委员任思忠以“卫生工作是爱兵观点的具体表现”教育全体干部，并经常在党的会议和行政会议上亲自布置卫生工作；中国人民解放军西北军区汽车某团团首长召集全体领导干部和卫生人员研究军区的卫生工作指示，并说：“搞好部队的卫生工作、作为考核干部的一条”；中国人民海军黄河部队每日三餐都有行政首长、支部负责人和医生负责检查。第二、爱国卫生运动与部队中心任务相结合。如中国人民志愿军卫生模范单位，把爱国卫生运动与战斗任务结合得很好；中国人民解放军卫生模范单位把爱国卫生运动与文化学习结合得很好。此外，部队把爱国卫生运动开展得好，对居民所起的推动作用也是极大的。
    总的说来，一九五二年爱国卫生运动的一般性的经验是：
    第一、必须认识推行卫生工作不是单靠卫生人员所能完成的，卫生工作必须与群众运动相结合，才能发展。爱国卫生运动所以能获得如此大的成绩，是由于各级首长负责，以卫生人员为骨干，发动了广大的群众，爱国卫生运动使我们找到了唯一正确的推行卫生工作的方法。另一方面，爱国卫生运动必须有卫生科学的指导，才能有步骤有目标地进行，不断地提高。
    第二、必须各有关部门——卫生部门、文教宣传部门、公安部门、交通运输部门、工业部门、农业部门、水利部门以及各种群众团体等——共同配合。在城市和农村的居民中间开展爱国卫生运动，妇女是一很大的力量，今后地方卫生部门应加强与妇女团体的联系。
    第三、必须使爱国卫生运动与生产任务及其他当前任务相结合，把爱国卫生运动看作是保证完成生产或其他当前任务的重要条件之一。强调生产忽视卫生是不对的，进行卫生工作时不照顾生产部门的具体情况也是不对的。
    第四、必须重视工作的检查。凡是爱国卫生运动开展得好的地区和单位，其成绩都是与反复深入检查分不开的。在市县级以上的卫生委员会里设专门负责检查的机构，并临时组织检查队，定期检查，总结经验，这种作法今后仍应继续采用。有的地区对下面的报告不认真分析，对实际情况不进行检查，即转报上级机关，这种官僚主义作风是应该纠正的。
    第五、消灭病媒昆虫要首先从改善环境卫生和个人卫生做起，包括清除垃圾、疏通沟渠、填平洼地、堵塞树洞、处理粪便、处理污水、提倡常洗衣服常洗澡等，并根据一定条件，逐步进行。对于病媒昆虫的直接扑打，要贯彻“打早、打小、打了”的作法。为减少肠胃传染病，除灭蝇外，还必须着重饮水的改善与食品行业特别是食品制造业的管理。有些地方只着重扑打蚊蝇，而未着重环境卫生的改善；或是只着重室内外清扫和灭蝇，而未着重饮水的改善与食品行业的管理；或只着重食品贩卖业的管理，而未着重食品制造业的管理。这些都是需要改进的。
    第六、必须善于掌握运动中的突击性活动与经常性活动这两种形式，并使之互相配合。没有突击性活动，不容易普遍地发动群众，没有经常性活动，不能巩固已获得的成果，并继续将运动深入推进。突击性活动是经常性活动的开始，经常性活动是突击性活动的继续。
    三、一九五三年继续开展爱国卫生运动的方针与任务
    一九五二年的爱国卫生运动已经得到了成绩，一九五三年是否还需要继续进行呢？中央人民政府决定还必须继续进行爱国卫生运动。这是因为：
    第一、美国帝国主义还在继续进行侵略朝鲜的战争，还继续在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战；如果我们不继续开展爱国卫生运动，我们就会上当。
    第二、我们的卫生状况虽然已有好转，但是距离应有的要求还很远。一九五二年的爱国卫生运动虽然已创造了一些卫生模范区域和单位，但是从数量上说，与我国如此广大面积相比，还是太少了；而且从质量上说，它们所达到的水平还不够高，特别是工厂矿山的爱国卫生运动一般开展得比较差，是与我国的建设任务极不相称的。我们绝不能停留在运动的目前阶段。
    第三、我们的卫生基础还很差，卫生部门本身的力量还很薄弱，经过群众性的爱国卫生运动来健全卫生工作的基础应是我们一个长时期的任务。
    一九五三年的爱国卫生运动的一般的任务仍以反对美国细菌战、清除蚊蝇孳生繁殖地带，捕灭病媒动物和普及卫生知识为主。
    （一）继续进行反细菌战的教育，加强反细菌战的措施。
    （二）要求更普遍地将污水坑填平，将淤塞的沟渠疏通。随时清除垃圾，并尽量将大小城市内的粪场移至郊外。注意修建及改良厕所、畜圈。灭蚊、灭蝇应从灭蛆、灭蛹、灭孑孓着手。注意改善及保护水源。
    （三）继续发动群众捕鼠，在发生过鼠疫的地区应彻底捕鼠。
    （四）教育并帮助群众，进行彻底灭虱。
    （五）动员大量的人采取多样的形式进行卫生宣传教育，以地方病季节病的预防知识、劳动卫生妇婴卫生知识和爱国卫生运动的经验介绍为主要的宣传教育内容。
    （六）创造更多的卫生模范地区，卫生模范单位和卫生模范人物。对已有的模范，应注意巩固，并帮助他们更好地向前发展。奖励一切适合当地情况的有利卫生的创造和发明。
    其次，在不同的区域，除上述任务外，还应有不同的重点：
    （一）城市——应特别着重食品行业、卫生行业
    （理发店、澡塘）和公共娱乐场所的卫生。要求这些行业和场所把环境卫生彻底做好。要求食品从制造到贩卖完全合乎清洁卫生条件。要求屠宰的牲畜完全无病，贩卖的肉类完全新鲜。食品行业及卫生行业人员应讲求个人卫生。各市卫生机关应组织这些人员，给以卫生训练，并可试行对这些人员进行健康检查。机关、团体、学校除上述一般要求外，应特别注意厨房、食堂、厕所、洗澡间卫生，并进行对于炊事人员的卫生训练。
    （二）工厂矿山——应将厨房、食堂、厕所、洗澡间的清洁卫生工作做好，改进车间、作坊、矿井的安全设施和通风装置，并依具体情况，改善其他作业卫生条件，以预防职业病。
    （三）农村——应着重于粪便处理和饮水的改善。粪便发酵法可普遍实行。合厕分肥、合厩分肥的办法应当提倡。可以打井而没有打井的地方应动员群众打井。不能打井而必须饮用河水的地方应当提倡建立简便的滤水池。在还有人畜共居习惯的地方，应当提倡人畜分居。没有洗澡塘的地方应当提倡建立洗澡塘。在有地方性流行病的地方，特别应当动员广大群众为防止地方病而斗争。
    （四）交通线——应做到大小车站及轮船码头的普遍清洁。加强国境交通检疫工作。在列车及船舶内应保证规定的卫生条例彻底实施。
    （五）部队——应贯彻执行部队各项卫生制度，把环境卫生、个人卫生完全做好。
    在一九五三年春季，全国应当进行一次短期的爱国卫生突击运动，以便及早消灭病媒昆虫，为全年的爱国卫生运动打下基础。
    为保证一九五三年的爱国卫生运动的顺利进行，各地爱国卫生运动的领导机关应在一九五三年一月底以前按照上述要点，根据一九五二年经验，提出本地一九五三年度爱国卫生运动的具体计划，其中应包括规定改善环境卫生、捕灭病媒动物等项的具体要求和数字，以及争取创造新的模范单位的数字。
    我们一定要很好地吸取一九五二年开展爱国卫生运动的许多经验，在已有的胜利的基础之上，准备在一九五三年取得更大的胜利。我们要保证实现毛主席的指示：“动员起来，讲究卫生，减少疾病，提高健康水平，粉碎敌人的细菌战争。”  （新华社）
