    Political Work on the Construction Site of Harbin Institute of Technology

    The task of the main building construction site of Harbin Institute of Technology is 22,000 square meters. Based on past experience, this project would take at least two years to complete. However, thanks to the serious and in-depth mobilization of the workforce by the Party organization, administration, and mass organizations at the construction site to adopt parallel assembly line methods and implement construction according to engineering instruction charts, the actual operational progress was shortened from one floor every fifteen days to ten days. Furthermore, advanced experiences such as Su Changyou's segmented bricklaying method and double-handed mortar squeezing method, Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method, and simultaneous parallel operation of steel bar workers, carpenters, tilers, and electricians were promoted. As a result, the original 14-month project plan was basically completed in just over six months.

    开展 Carry out Responsibility System Movement to Realize the Party's Ideological Leadership

    In the initial stage of construction, there were many problems at the construction site. First, the leadership of the construction site was in the hands of technical personnel and staff who had not been transformed. These people still retained feudal and capitalist ideas and employee viewpoints in their thinking and style of work, were irresponsible, discriminated against workers, rejected advanced experiences, and worshipped British and American technology. Although some construction workers were dissatisfied with these people's bad practices, they did not dare to speak out. Second, the organization of the construction site was unsound, lacking sections, units, and workshop structures. Workers had to find the construction site director to solve problems such as eating, sleeping, getting light bulbs, and repairing toilets. As a result, the construction site director was trapped in trivial matters all day long, and the large amount of idleness, rework, and material waste on the construction site went unaddressed, seriously affecting the quality of the project. Third, among the 890 workers on the entire construction site, more than 500 were temporary workers, newly recruited from various places, mostly farmers. Due to their long-term engagement in decentralized handicraft labor and seasonal production, these temporary workers showed a lack of organization and discipline in their work. Coupled with the existence of guild concepts in their minds, they exhibited a weak sense of planning in production. Furthermore, there was a lack of unity between temporary and permanent workers.

    Originally, the Party branch decided to start by strengthening class education and worker unity, organizing workers to learn advanced experiences, and launching an increase production and practice economy movement. However, because the serious phenomenon of no one being responsible for the management of the construction site was not resolved in time, incidents of "broken bricks, broken water, broken scaffolding" continued to occur during the competition, and the construction site remained chaotic. This situation made the Party branch clearly realize that it was necessary to first launch a mass responsibility system movement to overcome the on-site chaos caused by the lack of responsibility and establish the leadership ideology of the working class. Only in this way could advanced experiences be accepted by the masses.

    Regarding the issue of launching the responsibility system movement, there were serious ideological differences among the leading cadres: one opinion was against launching the responsibility system movement in a big way. They said, "We already have a responsibility system, just supplement it a bit!" "Don't go too far, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the workers and masses, and we won't be able to complete the task." Another opinion insisted on deeply mobilizing the masses, exposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible, launching criticism and self-criticism, and then establishing a responsibility system. After studying the instructions of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government on launching the responsibility system movement, the above ideological differences were quickly unified.

    On the basis of ideological unity, the Party branch convened a meeting of Party members, propagandists, and activists, calling on them to take the lead in examining and exposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible. Subsequently, the Communist Youth League established three inspection posts, and the trade union also convened a general meeting of all employees, expressing its determination to do a good job in this movement. The Party's propagandists paid attention to using realistic materials for propaganda at any time. The second group of bricklayers was idle for three hours due to the lack of material supply, and the workers complained on the spot. The propagandist Hu Sihu seized this fact and educated the workers. After exposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible, the steel bar team further launched a "anti-foreman" struggle and replaced the steel bar team leader.

    In order to give the workers and masses a deeper understanding of the responsibility system movement, the trade union's cultural and educational committee, under the leadership of the Party, held an exhibition on the facts of no one being responsible and irresponsibility. Various pictures and illustrations were used to explain the importance and prospects of China's basic construction. Based on the cartoon form most loved by the workers, the exhibition exposed the chaos and losses caused by the phenomenon of no one being responsible or irresponsible on the site, and inspired the workers and masses to establish the requirements of the responsibility system. After seeing these pictures, the workers quickly took action and initially reversed the chaotic state of the construction site.

    However, in this movement, some people adopted a cold or confrontational attitude. A person who had previously worked as a supervisor in a private construction factory said, "Such a large site cannot be without problems!" Those who had been foremen said, "If you do this, will you still want to build a building?" In addition, some people, although expressing their support for the responsibility system, did not dare to boldly participate in the movement. Based on the above situation, the branch believed that whether or not the thinking of these people could be transformed was the key to doing a good job in the responsibility system. Therefore, the branch concentrated its efforts to solve this problem. First, it suggested that the administration convene a meeting of technical personnel and staff. At the meeting, the socialist nature of our project, management methods, and the fundamental differences between the foreman-style management methods of private construction factories were explained. The significance of the responsibility system movement was explained. It was pointed out that it is the common responsibility of all employees to expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible and irresponsible on the site with a sense of ownership. Then, the technical personnel and staff were organized to study and chat, helping them gradually break free from the ideological influence of the old staff. Second, all the staff were re-educated with the painful facts exposed by the workers. They were organized to combine the opinions put forward by the workers with their own to conduct chats, self-examination, and mutual criticism, and change their negative attitude towards the responsibility system movement. Third, at the general meeting of all employees, the facts of no one being responsible were exposed, further educating the staff. Statistician Ma Jingyao exposed on the spot the bad behavior of the construction site director arbitrarily suppressing and altering accident reports (including on-site idleness, rework, safety, quality and other accidents). More than 400 incidents of no one being responsible were exposed at the meeting, and the root causes of these incidents were analyzed. After the meeting, the branch and the administration and mass organizations studied improvement methods and established a scientific responsibility system. At the same time, it was suggested to the administration to conduct a comprehensive quality inspection. The inspection revealed that there were still serious quality problems: such as platform cracks, door and window subsidence, beam and column misalignment, and other phenomena. Thus, with the joint efforts of the Party, the administration, and mass organizations, all employees formulated their own operational quality responsibility systems. The construction site initially achieved assigning people, assigning tasks, and defining quality, and began to reverse the chaotic phenomenon in the construction management of the construction site.

    Formulate a Construction Plan to Consolidate the Achievements of the Responsibility System

    In order to consolidate the achievements of the responsibility system, ensure project quality, and accelerate project progress, it is necessary to do a good job in the construction plan. The Party branch leads the construction plan in this way:

    First, conduct ideological investigation, eliminate ideological obstacles, and strengthen the concept of planning. First of all, overcome the following ideas: One is conservatism, thinking, "If the plan is set too high, it cannot be completed, if it is set low, the task can be exceeded, which is glorious." The other is indifference to the plan, thinking, "Whether there is a plan or not, we work anyway, we earn money the same way whether we make a plan or not." According to the above situation, the Party branch sent Party political instructors to the workshops to make mobilization reports to the workers and masses, and at the same time used blackboard newspapers, radio stations and other tools to publicize the benefits of making plans. The leader of the sixth group of bricklayers said: "In the past, I thought that planning was planning, and work was work. Now I know that planning is like the direction of our work. Without a plan, there is no direction."

    Second, organize technicians and staff to help workers calculate carefully and make specific plans. After carrying out the responsibility system movement, although the technicians and staff criticized their thinking of not going deep into the workers and masses and looking down on the workers and masses, how should they do it in the future? How can we better integrate with the workers? There is no way yet. The leadership issued the call to "go to the workers' sheds, explain the plan to the workers, explain the drawings and quality standards, help the workers calculate carefully, learn advanced experience, and make good workshop and team plans." Technicians and staff went deep into the workers and masses. The Wang Huati installation team was originally a relatively advanced team in the workshop. One day, it had made seven platforms, but this time it only booked two. The team leader said, "It's too little." The team members said, "If you book more, you can do it yourself. If you don't complete it, you will go to court." After the construction worker Zhou XueLi discovered this situation, he helped the team calculate carefully and formulated a plan to complete seven beams or six platforms every day. In this way, the workers' confidence in work was generally improved, and the deputy director of the workshop also expressed to the workers: "Guarantee to carefully explain the drawings, do it yourself in complex places, and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule." At the same time, each workshop team also made plans, and Party members, League members, and young workers also made personal guarantee plans. The branch also made a system of regular inspection. A new atmosphere of "resolutely fighting for the completion of the plan ahead of schedule" appeared throughout the construction site.

    After adopting the above methods, the concept of planning of all employees was strengthened, and the leadership and the masses were further united. In the past, the plan was only in the hands of the construction site director alone, and even some construction workers did not know it; now the plan is handed over to the workers for discussion, which not only initially overcomes the scattered and free style of workers, strengthens the unity of technicians and staff workers, but also promotes advanced experiences such as parallel assembly line operations and construction according to engineering instruction charts.

    Third, organize mass red flag competitions and mobilize the masses to fight for the completion and exceeding of the plan. First of all, it is to publicize the significance of the red flag competition, commend revolutionary collective heroism, criticize individual championshipism; commend the advanced thinking of finding tricks to promote advanced experience to ensure quality and win the red flag, and criticize the thinking of pure physical competition and rushing progress. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the competition, the branch studied the changes in the labor organization of ordinary workers and the learning of apprentices' skills. Under the leadership of the Party, the trade union launched workshops and workshops, workshops and administrations to sign contracts. Each workshop implements exchange inspections to ensure that they do not delay each other. The administration guarantees the timely supply of materials and tools to the workers, and does a good job in wages and welfare, while the workers guarantee to complete or exceed the administrative plan. In addition, old technical workers are mobilized to train apprentices and strive for the red flag.

    The red flag competition gave all employees a collective education in collectivism. Criticism and self-criticism among the workers and masses were carried out, and internal unity was strengthened. This not only enabled the original advanced experience to be widely promoted, but also gave play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the workers and made many inventions and creations. For example, Wang Yongshan, an old water and heating worker, improved the tension ring and increased work efficiency tenfold, and the team of bricklayer Su Changyou implemented the double-line bricklaying method to increase efficiency by 20%.

    Several Basic Experiences

    First, over the past year, we have deeply realized that strengthening the study of the Party's policies and production knowledge is the basic key to doing a good job in political work on the construction site. Many experiences have proved that only when we master the Party's production policies, understand the general technology of production, and are familiar with and master the laws and characteristics of production on the construction site, can we quickly change from outsiders to insiders, can we combine political work with economic work, so as to ensure and supervise the completion of production tasks and establish the prestige of political work. Recalling when we first arrived at the construction site, because we did not understand the business, we could not combine ideological education with production. Some workers said that we "can only hold meetings and cannot solve problems." When the political workers on the construction site initially understood production knowledge and the Party's policies began to be combined with production, the attitude of some workers who despised political workers changed. Political work is concrete, not abstract. If you don't understand this, you won't achieve the goal of political and ideological leadership.

    Second, the key to realizing the Party's guarantee and supervision role in production on the construction site lies in the Party's continuous and firm struggle against all old management ideas and methods, implementing the Party's democratic management thinking, and strengthening the responsibility of workers for national projects.

    In order to achieve this, we must first educate technical personnel and staff with patience and care in the spirit of unity, transformation, and striving for education, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and establish a democratic style. At the same time, the leadership must also regularly check the implementation of the responsibility system. Secondly, due to the characteristics of construction site production of "fixed products, mobile personnel" and the urgency of time and complexity of the project, there must also be a strong concept of planning. Therefore, the plan must be handed over to technical personnel, staff, and workers for discussion at all levels, so that the plan formulated is practical; and the inspection work must be strengthened to ensure the smooth implementation of the plan. In addition, resolutely fighting against the phenomenon of neglecting workers' safety and welfare, strengthening safety and welfare work, repeatedly conducting safety education for technical personnel and staff, and improving welfare facilities are also one of the important supervisory work of the branch on the construction site. Only by doing a good job in the above-mentioned scope of supervision can we realize the construction policy of "faster, better, and more economical." Third, vigorously promoting advanced work experience with decisive and general significance is the main content of the branch's daily work. If we leave the promotion of advanced experience to carry out political work, then improving labor efficiency and carrying out competitions will fail.

    At present, the advanced experience in basic construction is mainly the transformation from individual handicraft production to scientific, organized, collective labor division and specialization. After the Su Changyou-style advanced experience was widely promoted in various types of work, it opened up broad prospects for the use of mechanized tools; especially the promotion of parallel assembly line methods, so that the labor productivity of various types of work was fully utilized. However, to achieve this, we must abandon the conservative individualism fostered by past individual labor and replace it with advanced collectivist thinking. Therefore, when we promoted advanced experience, we not only paid attention to technical reform and labor organization reform; but also combined the process of labor organization and technical reform to carry out the struggle between advanced and backward thinking, and carry out patriotic education, national industrialization, basic construction mechanization, and collectivist ideological education. We criticized the thinking of some people who were afraid of "specialization" and "only knowing one line, and not being able to get along outside."

### 哈尔滨工业大学工地的政治工作

    哈尔滨工业大学工地的政治工作
    哈尔滨工业大学校舍主楼建筑工地的任务是两万二千平方公尺。根据往常的经验，这个工程至少要两年才能完成。由于这个工地的党组织、行政和群众团体认真深入地发动了职工群众采用平行流水作业法，按工程指示图表进行施工的结果，使实际操作进度由开始十五天造一层楼缩短到十天；并且推广了苏长有的分段砌砖法和双手挤浆法、谢万福的木工流水作业法、铁筋工的大小流水和木瓦铁筋与电气工同时并行作业等先进经验。这样，原定十四个月的工程计划，六个多月基本上完成了。
    开展责任制运动，实现党的思想领导
    开工初期，工地上问题很多。首先工地领导权掌握在未经改造的技术人员和职员手中。而这些人在思想作风上都残留着封建的和资本主义的思想和雇佣观点，工作不负责任，歧视工人，拒绝先进经验，崇拜英美技术。虽然有些施工员不满意这些人的恶劣作风，但不敢提出来。其次，工地的组织不健全，工地没有科、股和车间的组织。工人的吃饭、睡觉，领电灯泡、修厕所等问题都得找工地主任解决。因此工地主任成天陷于琐碎事务中，工地上的大量窝工、返工、材料浪费等现象，则无人过问，严重地影响了工程质量。再次，全工地八百九十个工人中有五百多名是临时工，初从各地招来，大部分是农民。这些临时工由于长期从事于分散手工业劳动以及季节性生产，在劳动中就表现了缺乏组织性、纪律性，再加上他们思想上存在着行会观念，因而在生产中表现着计划观念薄弱。而且临时工和固定工之间还有不团结现象。
    本来党支部决定从加强阶级教育，加强工人团结着手，组织工人们学习先进经验，开展增产节约运动。但由于没有及时解决工地管理上的严重无人负责的现象，竞赛中“断砖、断水、断脚手”的事件不断发生，工地上依然一片混乱。这种情况使党支部明确认识到必须首先开展一个群众性的责任制运动，克服无人负责所造成的现场混乱状态，树立工人阶级的领导思想。这样，先进经验才能为群众所接受。
    关于开展责任制运动的问题，在领导干部间曾有着严重的思想分歧：一种是不主张大张旗鼓地开展责任制运动。他们说：“责任制度都有啦，再补充补充就行啦！”“别搞的过火了，打击职工群众的情绪，就完不成工作任务。”另一种意见则坚持必须深入地发动群众，揭发无人负责的现象，展开批评和自我批评，然后建立责任制度。在学习东北人民政府工业部关于开展责任制运动的指示后，上述思想分歧很快就得到统一。
    在思想统一的基础上，党支部召开了党员、宣传员和积极分子会议，号召带头检讨并揭发无人负责的现象。接着青年团成立了三个检查岗，工会也召开了全体职工大会，表示搞好这次运动的决心。党的宣传员则随时注意用现实材料进行宣传。瓦工第二小组又因材料供应不上窝工三小时，工友在现场发牢骚。宣传员胡四虎就抓住这一事实，向工人们进行教育。铁筋队在揭发无人负责的现象后，就进一步展开“反把头”斗争，撤换了铁筋队长的职务。
    为了使职工群众对责任制运动有更深刻的认识，工会文教委员会在党的领导下，举办了一次无人负责及不负责任事实的展览会。用各种图片、画片说明了我国基本建设重要性和前途。并根据工人最喜爱的漫画形式，揭发现场中无人负责或不负责任造成的混乱情况和损失，启发工人群众建立责任制的要求。工友们看了这些图画，迅速地行动起来，初步扭转了工地混乱状态。
    但是在这个运动中，有些人是采取冷淡或对抗的态度。过去曾经在私人营造厂作监工的人说：“这样大的现场那能没问题！”当过把头的则说，“你们这样搞，还要不要盖大楼啦？”另外，有一部分人虽然表示赞成责任制，但不敢大胆地参加运动。根据以上情况，支部认为能否转变这些人的思想，是搞好责任制的关键，于是支部集中力量，解决这一个问题。第一、建议行政召开技术人员职员会议。会上讲明我们工程的社会主义性质、管理方法和私人营造厂把头式的管理方法的根本不同。说明责任制运动的意义。指出：以主人翁的态度来揭发现场无人负责与不负责任现象是全体职工的共同职责。接着就组织技术人员职员学习、漫谈，帮助他们逐渐从旧职员的思想影响下解放出来。第二、以工人揭发的种种痛心事实，向全体职员再次进行了教育。组织他们结合工人提出的意见联系自己进行漫谈、检讨、互相批评，转变他们对责任制运动的消极态度。第三、在全体职工大会上，揭发无人负责的事实，进一步给职员以教育。统计员马敬尧当场揭发了工地主任擅自积压、涂改事故表报（包括现场窝工、返工、保安、质量等事故）的恶劣行为。会上共揭发了四百多桩无人负责的事件，并分析了这些事件的产生根源。会后支部和行政、群众团体研究了改进办法和建立科学的责任制度。同时，又建议行政，进行了一次全面的质量大检查。在检查中发现了质量上还存在着严重问题：如平台裂缝纹，门窗口下沉，梁柱不正等等现象。于是在党、行政和群众团体共同努力下，全体职工都订出了每个人的操作质量责任制。工地上初步地作到了定人、定事、定质量，开始扭转了工地施工管理上的混乱现象。
    订好施工计划巩固责任制成果
    为了巩固责任制运动的成果，保证工程质量，加速工程进度，必须作好施工计划的工作。党支部对施工计划是这样领导的：
    第一、进行思想调查，扫除思想障碍，加强计划观点。首先要克服下列几种思想：一种是保守思想，认为：“计划订的高了完不成，少订了可以超过任务，光荣。”一种是对订计划漠不关心，认为“什么计划不计划，订也干活不订也干活，订不订一样挣钱”。党支部根据上述情况，就由党的政治教员深入各车间向工人群众作了动员报告，同时运用黑板报、广播站等工具宣传订计划的好处。瓦工六组组长说：“过去我想计划是计划，干活是干活，现在才知道计划就像是我们工作的方向，没有计划就没有方向。”
    第二、组织技术员、职员帮助工人算细账，订出具体计划。在开展责任制运动后，技术员、职员虽然都批判了自己不深入工人群众，瞧不起工人群众的思想，但今后怎样作呢？怎样才能和工人结合得好？还没有办法。领导方面发出了“到工棚子去，向工人交代计划，交代图纸和质量标准，帮助工人算细账，学习先进经验，订好车间、小组计划”的号召。技术人员和职员纷纷深入工人群众。王化提安装小组，原是车间比较先进的小组，有一天曾作过七块平台，但这次却只订了两块，组长说：“太少了。”组员说：“多订你一人去干去，完不成你进法院。”施工员周学礼发现这样情况后，就帮助小组算细账，制订出每天完成七架梁或六块平台的计划。这样工人工作信心普遍提高，车间副主任也向工人表示：“保证要细心交代图纸，复杂地方自己动手，争取提前完成任务。”同时各个车间小组也都订了计划，党、团员，青工又都订了个人保证计划，支部并订出按期检查的制度。整个工地出现了“坚决为提前完成计划而奋斗”的新气象。
    采用上述方法后，加强了全体职工的计划观念，使领导和群众进一步结合起来，过去计划仅是掌握在工地主任一个人手中，甚至某些施工员都不知道；现在把计划交给工人讨论，不仅初步地克服了工人中的散漫自由的作风，加强了技术人员和职员工人的团结，而且平行流水作业、按工程指示图表施工等先进经验普遍推广了。
    第三、组织群众性的红旗竞赛，发动群众为完成和超过计划而斗争。首先是宣传红旗竞赛的意义，表扬革命的集体英雄主义，批判个人锦标主义；表扬找窍门推广先进经验保证质量夺取红旗的先进思想，批判单纯的体力比赛及抢进度的思想。为了保证竞赛的顺利进行，支部研究了普通工人劳动组织的改变和徒工技术的学习问题。工会在党的领导下，发动车间和车间、车间和行政订立了合同。各车间实行交换检查，保证互不耽误。行政向工人保证材料工具的及时供应，并作好工资及福利工作，工人则保证完成或超过行政计划。另外还动员老技术工人带好徒弟争取红旗。
    红旗竞赛给全体职工进行了一次集体主义教育。开展了职工群众中的批评与自我批评，加强了内部团结。这样不仅使原有先进经验得到普遍推广，并且发挥了职工的创造性与积极性，有了不少发明创造。例如：水暖工王永山老工友改进涨力圈提高工作效率十倍，瓦工苏长有小组实行双线砌砖法提高效率百分之二十。
    几点基本经验
    第一，一年来，使我们深深体会到加强对党的政策和生产知识的学习是作好工地政治工作基本关键。许多经验证明，只有我们掌握了党的生产政策，懂得了生产上的一般的技术，熟悉和掌握了工地生产的规律和特点，才能迅速地从外行变成内行，才能把政治工作与经济工作结合起来，达到保证与监督生产任务的完成，树立起政治工作的威信。回忆我们开始到工地时，由于不懂业务，不能把思想教育和生产结合起来，部分工人说我们“只会开会不能解决问题”。当工地的政治工作人员初步懂得了生产知识，使党的政策开始与生产相结合的时候，就改变了部分工人蔑视政治工作人员的态度。政治工作是具体的，不是抽象的。不懂得这一点，也就达不到政治思想领导的目的。
    第二，在工地中实现党对生产的保证、监督作用的关键，在于党要不断地、坚定地和一切旧的管理思想和方法作斗争，贯彻党的民主管理的思想，加强职工对国家工程的负责观念。
    为了做到这一点，首先必须本着团结、改造、争取教育的精神，耐心细致地去教育技术人员和职员，开展批评与自我批评，树立民主作风。同时，领导方面还须经常检查责任制的贯彻情况。其次，由于工地生产的“产品固定，人员流动”和时间紧迫、工程复杂的特点，还必须有坚强的计划观念。因此必须把计划交给技术人员、职员和工人来层层讨论，使订出的计划切实可行；并还要加强检查工作，以保证计划的顺利贯彻。此外，坚决和忽视工人保安福利的现象作斗争，加强保安福利工作，反复地向技术人员、职员进行保安教育，改善福利设施，也是支部在工地重要监督工作之一。只有做好上述范围的监督工作，才能实现“又快、又好、又省”的建筑方针。第三，大力推广有决定性的带普遍意义的先进工作经验，是支部日常工作的主要内容。如果我们离开了推广先进经验去进行政治工作，那末，提高劳动效率、开展竞赛都将落空。
    目前基本建设方面的先进经验主要的是由个体的手工业式生产向科学的有组织的集体劳动分工专业的转化。苏长有式的先进经验在各工种普遍推广后，给机械化工具的使用开辟了广阔的前途；特别是平行流水作业法的推广，使各工种的劳动生产率得到充分发挥。但是要做到这一点，必须丢掉过去的个体劳动所养成的保守的个人主义思想，而代之以先进的集体主义思想。所以我们在推广先进经验时，不仅注意了技术改革，劳动组织的改革；同时也结合劳动组织和技术改革的过程，开展先进思想和落后思想的斗争，进行爱国主义教育，国家工业化，基本建设机械化和集体主义的思想教育。批判某些人怕“专业化”、“只会一行，到外边吃不开”的思想。
