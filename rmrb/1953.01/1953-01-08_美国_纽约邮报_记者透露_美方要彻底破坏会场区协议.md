Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: U.S. newspapers admit that after unilaterally and indefinitely suspending the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. side has continuously created incidents to sabotage the agreement, with the aim of completely destroying the agreement between the two sides on the conference area and neutral zone. The "New York Post" of December 4th published a report by reporter Allen stating that Clark "strongly advocated that the Allied forces cancel the unassailable privileges of the huge 'neutral' zone around Panmunjom that have been in place for the past few months." The facts of the past three months have proven that the U.S. side is attempting to realize this conspiracy. After admitting many times that the intrusion into the conference area was an act of sabotaging the neutral zone agreement, the U.S. side recently brazenly and unreasonably refused to take responsibility for the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into the conference area incident. This shows that the U.S. side will more blatantly create incidents to sabotage the agreement in the future, in order to push the armistice negotiations towards a final breakdown.

    美国“纽约邮报”记者透露
    美方要彻底破坏会场区协议
    【新华社开城七日电】美国报纸承认，美方在片面无限期中断朝鲜停战谈判以后连续制造破坏协议事件，其目的是要彻底破坏双方对会场区、中立区的协议。十二月四日的“纽约邮报”刊载记者艾伦的报道说，克拉克“极力主张联军取消过去数月来施用于板门店四周的巨大的‘中立’地带的不受攻击的特权”。将近三个月来的事实证明，美方正在企图实现这一阴谋。美方在多次承认了侵越会场区是破坏中立区协议的行为之后，最近竟然蛮横无理地拒绝承当美机侵越会场区事件的责任，这说明美方今后将更加明目张胆地制造破坏协议的事件，以便将停战谈判推向最后破裂。
