    New Powerful Development of the Soviet National Economy
    The communiqu√© issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the results of the implementation of the 1952 National Economic Development Plan shows that the Soviet national economy has achieved new and powerful development. The production in the second year of the Soviet Fifth Five-Year Plan, like the first year, reached and exceeded its predetermined goals at a steady pace. In 1952, the total output of Soviet industry increased by 11 percent compared with 1951. In particular, the most important industries in heavy industry, such as metallurgy, fuel, and electricity, exceeded the original plan. Agriculture achieved a general bumper harvest, with a total grain harvest of 8 billion poods, and the most important grain crop, wheat, increased by 23 percent compared with 1951, surpassing the wheat production of the United States and Canada and ranking first in the world. Other industries, such as transportation and national capital construction, greatly exceeded the production level of 1951. Throughout the entire industrial production, costs were generally reduced and the quality of products was improved. The new and tremendous achievements of the Soviet national economy have created favorable conditions for the early completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people are guaranteeing the continuous upsurge of socialist production and the continuous improvement of their material and cultural living standards with their creative labor. They are victoriously advancing towards communism.
    The new development of the Soviet national economy in 1952 once again demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Never in human history has a social system had such large-scale construction as the Soviet socialist system and achieved such rapid development. In implementing the 1952 National Economic Development Plan, the Soviet Union extensively used new machines and adopted advanced technical operating methods, enabling large-scale mechanization and automation of production. In particular, the mechanization of arduous work further unleashed production potential and improved labor productivity. In the past year alone, the machine-building industry invented approximately 600 important new types of machines and equipment. The Soviet working people have demonstrated increasing political and production enthusiasm in production, and have extensively put forward various inventions and rationalization proposals to improve production. The fact that approximately 800,000 inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals were adopted in industry, construction, and transportation last year vividly illustrates the amazing production enthusiasm of the Soviet people. Due to the development of productive forces in the Soviet national economy, the material life and cultural level of the Soviet people have been continuously improved. This proves that the socialist state system and economic system have opened up unlimited prospects for the continuous improvement of social productive forces. Economic crises and unemployment will never occur in the Soviet Union. People all over the world increasingly believe that the socialist system means the unlimited development of social productive forces, people living an increasingly better and happier life, and the continuous progress and prosperity of the country.
    In contrast to the situation in socialist Soviet Union, the social productive forces in capitalist countries around the world have stagnated and are falling into an increasingly deepening general crisis of capitalism and frequently recurring economic crises. According to official U.S. figures, the index of U.S. industrial production fell by 3 percent in the first ten months of 1952 compared with the same period in 1951. Due to inflation, increased taxes, and rising living costs, the purchasing power of the American people is shrinking, and their living conditions are deteriorating. The militarization of the economy in the United States has only brought the greatest profits to Wall Street bosses, but has had a more profound adverse impact on the U.S. economy. The situation in other capitalist countries that rely on the United States is of course even worse. British industrial production has fallen by almost 6 percent in the past year. French exports in 1952 were only half of those in 1951, and the Japanese economy is already showing signs of panic due to overproduction. By the end of 1952, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in major capitalist countries had reached 32 million. Militarization and war preparation policies have brought the heaviest burden to the people of all capitalist countries. Taxes are constantly increasing, prices are soaring, and real wages have been falling. The brutal exploitation and planned plunder of the laboring people of their own countries and the people of the colonies have become the source of capitalist monopoly capitalists' pursuit of maximum profits. Therefore, capitalism means plunder and war, and means hunger and disaster for the broad masses of laboring people.
    In the great competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism, the decisive superiority of the socialist system has become increasingly apparent year by year. Comrade Stalin made extremely profound explanations and arguments on the fundamental reasons for this in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R." Comrade Malenkov elaborated on this argument in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saying:
    "Comrade Stalin proved that the main features and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism are: 'To secure the maximum of capitalist profit through the exploitation, ruin and impoverishment of the majority of the population of the given country, through the enslavement and systematic plunder of the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and, lastly, through wars and militarization of the national economy, which are utilized for the obtaining of the highest profits.' ('Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.') This law exposes and explains the striking contradictions of capitalism, and completely exposes the roots of the capitalist countries' policies of aggression and plunder. The operation of this law leads to the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, and causes the inevitable growth and outbreak of all the contradictions of capitalist society."
    "In sharp contrast to decaying capitalism, the socialist system is rising and flourishing. The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by Comrade Stalin are: 'The securing of the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole of society through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques.' (Ibid.) Comrade Stalin pointed out that the purpose of the socialist mode of production is not profit, but man and his needs, that is, to satisfy the material and cultural needs of man. Ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the entire society is the goal of socialist production, and the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of advanced technology is the means to achieve this goal. The operation of this law leads to the upsurge of social productive forces, the prosperity of society, and the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the working people."
    The continuous upsurge of the Soviet national economy has further strengthened the forces of the Soviet Union and the world's peace, democracy and socialist camp. The new achievements of the Soviet Union have inspired the working people of the people's democratic countries who are building socialism, and have also inspired the progressive people all over the world who love peace and democracy and oppose capitalist enslavement. People all over the world yearn for the Soviet Union and learn from the glorious example of the Soviet people. With the kind help of the Soviet people, the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe are smoothly carrying out socialist construction and have already achieved brilliant results. The national economies of the people's democratic countries have been continuously growing, and the living standards of the people are improving day by day. In 1952, the working people of Czechoslovakia increased the total industrial output to nearly twice the pre-war level. The industrial production level in Poland has reached approximately twice that of 1949. Romania's industrial production increased by 24.5 percent compared with 1951. The Bulgarian people completed their first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. Hungary's total industrial output increased by 22 percent compared with 1951. Albania's total industrial output doubled compared with 1951. These facts powerfully prove that learning from the Soviet socialist state system and economic system, and learning from the advanced technology and successful experience of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy, can eliminate poverty and make the country prosperous and strong.
    Our people have resolutely chosen the road to socialism. In the past three years, with the selfless help of the Soviet Union, our people have made significant achievements in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In order to continuously develop various construction undertakings in the future, and for the victory of the struggle against aggression and defending peace, our people must strive to consolidate and strengthen the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance and learn from the Soviet Union even better. Especially in the large-scale economic construction that has already begun, we must carefully learn from the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy, so that our country can accelerate on the road to industrialization.
