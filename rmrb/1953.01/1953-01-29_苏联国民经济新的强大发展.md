    New Powerful Development of the Soviet National Economy
    The communiqué issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the results of the implementation of the 1952 National Economic Development Plan shows that the Soviet national economy has achieved new and powerful development. The production in the second year of the Soviet Fifth Five-Year Plan, like the first year, reached and exceeded its predetermined goals at a steady pace. In 1952, the total output of Soviet industry increased by 11 percent compared with 1951. In particular, the most important industries in heavy industry, such as metallurgy, fuel, and electricity, exceeded the original plan. Agriculture achieved a general bumper harvest, with a total grain harvest of 8 billion poods, and the most important grain crop, wheat, increased by 23 percent compared with 1951, surpassing the wheat production of the United States and Canada and ranking first in the world. Other industries, such as transportation and national capital construction, greatly exceeded the production level of 1951. Throughout the entire industrial production, costs were generally reduced and the quality of products was improved. The new and tremendous achievements of the Soviet national economy have created favorable conditions for the early completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people are guaranteeing the continuous upsurge of socialist production and the continuous improvement of their material and cultural living standards with their creative labor. They are victoriously advancing towards communism.
    The new development of the Soviet national economy in 1952 once again demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Never in human history has a social system had such large-scale construction as the Soviet socialist system and achieved such rapid development. In implementing the 1952 National Economic Development Plan, the Soviet Union extensively used new machines and adopted advanced technical operating methods, enabling large-scale mechanization and automation of production. In particular, the mechanization of arduous work further unleashed production potential and improved labor productivity. In the past year alone, the machine-building industry invented approximately 600 important new types of machines and equipment. The Soviet working people have demonstrated increasing political and production enthusiasm in production, and have extensively put forward various inventions and rationalization proposals to improve production. The fact that approximately 800,000 inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals were adopted in industry, construction, and transportation last year vividly illustrates the amazing production enthusiasm of the Soviet people. Due to the development of productive forces in the Soviet national economy, the material life and cultural level of the Soviet people have been continuously improved. This proves that the socialist state system and economic system have opened up unlimited prospects for the continuous improvement of social productive forces. Economic crises and unemployment will never occur in the Soviet Union. People all over the world increasingly believe that the socialist system means the unlimited development of social productive forces, people living an increasingly better and happier life, and the continuous progress and prosperity of the country.
    In contrast to the situation in socialist Soviet Union, the social productive forces in capitalist countries around the world have stagnated and are falling into an increasingly deepening general crisis of capitalism and frequently recurring economic crises. According to official U.S. figures, the index of U.S. industrial production fell by 3 percent in the first ten months of 1952 compared with the same period in 1951. Due to inflation, increased taxes, and rising living costs, the purchasing power of the American people is shrinking, and their living conditions are deteriorating. The militarization of the economy in the United States has only brought the greatest profits to Wall Street bosses, but has had a more profound adverse impact on the U.S. economy. The situation in other capitalist countries that rely on the United States is of course even worse. British industrial production has fallen by almost 6 percent in the past year. French exports in 1952 were only half of those in 1951, and the Japanese economy is already showing signs of panic due to overproduction. By the end of 1952, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in major capitalist countries had reached 32 million. Militarization and war preparation policies have brought the heaviest burden to the people of all capitalist countries. Taxes are constantly increasing, prices are soaring, and real wages have been falling. The brutal exploitation and planned plunder of the laboring people of their own countries and the people of the colonies have become the source of capitalist monopoly capitalists' pursuit of maximum profits. Therefore, capitalism means plunder and war, and means hunger and disaster for the broad masses of laboring people.
    In the great competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism, the decisive superiority of the socialist system has become increasingly apparent year by year. Comrade Stalin made extremely profound explanations and arguments on the fundamental reasons for this in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R." Comrade Malenkov elaborated on this argument in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saying:
    "Comrade Stalin proved that the main features and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism are: 'To secure the maximum of capitalist profit through the exploitation, ruin and impoverishment of the majority of the population of the given country, through the enslavement and systematic plunder of the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and, lastly, through wars and militarization of the national economy, which are utilized for the obtaining of the highest profits.' ('Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.') This law exposes and explains the striking contradictions of capitalism, and completely exposes the roots of the capitalist countries' policies of aggression and plunder. The operation of this law leads to the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, and causes the inevitable growth and outbreak of all the contradictions of capitalist society."
    "In sharp contrast to decaying capitalism, the socialist system is rising and flourishing. The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by Comrade Stalin are: 'The securing of the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole of society through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques.' (Ibid.) Comrade Stalin pointed out that the purpose of the socialist mode of production is not profit, but man and his needs, that is, to satisfy the material and cultural needs of man. Ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the entire society is the goal of socialist production, and the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of advanced technology is the means to achieve this goal. The operation of this law leads to the upsurge of social productive forces, the prosperity of society, and the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the working people."
    The continuous upsurge of the Soviet national economy has further strengthened the forces of the Soviet Union and the world's peace, democracy and socialist camp. The new achievements of the Soviet Union have inspired the working people of the people's democratic countries who are building socialism, and have also inspired the progressive people all over the world who love peace and democracy and oppose capitalist enslavement. People all over the world yearn for the Soviet Union and learn from the glorious example of the Soviet people. With the kind help of the Soviet people, the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe are smoothly carrying out socialist construction and have already achieved brilliant results. The national economies of the people's democratic countries have been continuously growing, and the living standards of the people are improving day by day. In 1952, the working people of Czechoslovakia increased the total industrial output to nearly twice the pre-war level. The industrial production level in Poland has reached approximately twice that of 1949. Romania's industrial production increased by 24.5 percent compared with 1951. The Bulgarian people completed their first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. Hungary's total industrial output increased by 22 percent compared with 1951. Albania's total industrial output doubled compared with 1951. These facts powerfully prove that learning from the Soviet socialist state system and economic system, and learning from the advanced technology and successful experience of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy, can eliminate poverty and make the country prosperous and strong.
    Our people have resolutely chosen the road to socialism. In the past three years, with the selfless help of the Soviet Union, our people have made significant achievements in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In order to continuously develop various construction undertakings in the future, and for the victory of the struggle against aggression and defending peace, our people must strive to consolidate and strengthen the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance and learn from the Soviet Union even better. Especially in the large-scale economic construction that has already begun, we must carefully learn from the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy, so that our country can accelerate on the road to industrialization.

    苏联国民经济新的强大发展
    苏联部长会议中央统计局发表的一九五二年发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报，表明苏联国民经济获得了新的强大发展。苏联第五个斯大林五年计划第二年度的生产，像第一年度一样，又以稳定的步伐达到并超过了它预定的目标。一九五二年苏联工业的总产量，比一九五一年增加了百分之十一，特别是重工业中的冶金、燃料和电力等最主要的工业，都超过了原来的计划；农业得到普遍丰收，谷物总收获量达到八十亿普特，而最重要的谷类作物小麦，比一九五一年增加了百分之二十三，超过美国、加拿大的小麦生产量而稳居世界第一位；其他如运输业和国家基本建设，都大大地超过了一九五一年的生产水平。在整个工业生产中，普遍降低了成本，提高了产品的质量。苏联国民经济新的巨大成就，为提前完成第五个五年计划，创造了良好的条件。苏联人民以自己的创造性的劳动，保证着社会主义生产的不断高涨，保证着他们自己物质和文化生活水平的不断提高。他们在苏联共产党的领导下，正在胜利地走向共产主义。
    一九五二年苏联国民经济的新发展，再一次显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无可比拟的优越性。人类历史上从来没有一个社会制度有过像苏联社会主义制度所有的这样大规模的建设，并且得到这样飞快的发展。苏联在执行一九五二年发展国民经济计划中，广泛地使用了新机器和采用了先进的技术作业法，使生产大规模机械化和自动化；特别是费力的工作机械化，进一步发挥了生产潜力，提高了劳动生产率。仅机器制造业在过去一年内，就发明了约六百种重要的新式机器和设备。苏联劳动人民在生产中表现出日益增长的政治和生产积极性，广泛地提出了各种改进生产的发明和合理化建议。仅以工业、建筑和运输方面在去年采用了约八十万件发明、技术改良和合理化建议这一事实，就生动地说明了苏联人民惊人的生产热情。由于苏联国民经济中发展了生产力，使得苏联人民的物质生活和文化水平得以不断的提高。这证明社会主义国家制度和经济制度，为社会生产力的不断提高开辟了无限的前途。苏联永远也不会发生经济危机和失业的现象。全世界人民日益相信，社会主义制度就意味着社会生产力的无限发展，人民过着日益美好幸福的生活，国家不断的进步和繁荣。
    与社会主义苏联的情况相反，资本主义世界各国的社会生产力已经停滞不前，正陷于日益加深的资本主义总危机与经常反复发生的经济危机之中。根据美国官方的数字，美国的工业生产的指数，在一九五二年十个月内比一九五一年同期降低了百分之三。由于通货膨胀，捐税加重，生活费用不断上涨，美国人民的购买力正日趋萎缩，他们的生活条件越来越恶化了。美国实行经济军事化，只给华尔街老板带来了最大的利润，对美国的经济却发生了更深刻的不利的影响。仰赖美国的其他资本主义国家的情况当然更坏。英国的工业生产在过去一年差不多下降了百分之六，法国一九五二年的输出仅及一九五
    一年的一半，日本的经济已经呈现出生产过剩的恐慌。到一九五二年年底为止，在各主要资本主义国家的失业和半失业者已达三千二百万人。军事化和备战政策给各资本主义国家人民带来了最沉重的负担，赋税不断增加，物价飞涨，实际工资一直在下跌。对本国劳动人民和殖民地人民进行残酷剥削和有计划的掠夺，已经成为资本主义垄断资本家攫取最大限度利润的来源。因此，资本主义就意味着掠夺和战争，意味着广大劳动人民的饥饿和灾难。
    在社会主义和资本主义这两个制度的巨大竞赛中，社会主义制度具有决定意义的优越性已经一年年地愈来愈明显了。其根本的原因，斯大林同志在他的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中作了极深湛的说明和论断。马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中阐述这个论断说：
    “斯大林同志证明了，现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：‘用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。’（‘苏联社会主义经济问题’）这个法则揭露并说明了资本主义的惊人矛盾，而且把资本主义国家的侵略掠夺政策的根源完全揭露出来了。这个法则的作用导致资本主义总危机的加深，并且引起资本主义社会一切矛盾的必然增长和爆发。”
    “与腐朽的资本主义完全相反，社会主义制度是上升的、繁荣的。斯大林同志发现的社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：‘用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。’（同上）斯大林同志指出，社会主义生产方式的目的不是利润，而是人及其需要，即满足人的物质和文化的需要。保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要是社会主义生产的目的，而在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善则是达到这个目的的手段。这种法则的作用引导到社会生产力的高涨、社会的繁荣以及劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的不断提高。”
    苏联国民经济的不断高涨，使苏联和全世界的和平民主与社会主义阵营的力量进一步加强。苏联的新成就，鼓舞了正在建设社会主义的各人民民主国家的劳动人民，也鼓舞了全世界爱好和平民主、反对资本主义奴役的进步人民。全世界人民都向往着苏联，学习着苏联人民的光荣的榜样。东欧各人民民主国家在苏联人民亲切的帮助下，正在顺利地进行社会主义建设，并已经取得了光辉成绩。各人民民主国家的国民经济得到了不断的增长，人民生活水平正在一天天改善。捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民在一九五二年已把工业总产量提高到将近战前水平的两倍；波兰工业生产水平已达到一九四九年约二倍；罗马尼亚的工业生产量比一九五一年增加了百分之二十四点五；保加利亚人民提前一年完成了第
    一个五年计划；匈牙利的工业总产量比一九五一年提高百分之二十二；阿尔巴尼亚的工业总产量比一九五一年增加了一倍。这些事实，有力地证明学习苏联社会主义的国家制度和经济制度，学习苏联发展国民经济的先进技术和成功的经验，就能免除贫穷而使国家繁荣和富强。
    我国人民坚决选择了走向社会主义的道路。三年来在苏联无私的帮助下，我国人民在学习苏联的先进经验方面，得到了重大的成就。我国人民为了今后各项建设事业的不断发展，为了反对侵略保卫和平的斗争的胜利，必须努力巩固和加强中苏友好同盟，更好地学习苏联。特别是在已经开始的大规模经济建设中，我们必须精心地学习苏联发展国民经济的先进经验和先进的技术，使我们的国家加速走上工业化的道路。
