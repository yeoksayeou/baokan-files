    The "Mobile Post Office" on the Construction Site

    No matter if it's the scorching summer, the windy and snowy winter, or a torrential rainy day, at the construction site of the Shanxi State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, there is a young postman who arrives in a hurry on his bicycle every day. He is so punctual that the workers can always wait for him on time at the door of each worker dormitory. As soon as he arrives, a large number of warm letters, packages, and new books and newspapers are taken out of his mailbag and delivered to the workers' hands; and from the workers' hands, he takes away letters remitting money to their families…

    Zhang Daozhong, a member of the Communist Youth League, has been working on this vast construction site for more than a year. As he watches the factory buildings under construction change their appearance day by day, and thinks of similar large factories to be built all over the country, how fascinated he is by the future era of the motherland! … He entrusts his love for the motherland to this factory under construction, wishing that its whistle would sound sooner. Therefore, from the beginning of the factory's construction, he voluntarily requested to be responsible for the postal work of this construction site, to serve the staff and workers of the basic construction site with his own strength.

    The construction site where Zhang Daozhong travels is in a remote rural area six or seven miles away from the county town, and most of the employees come from Shanghai. In addition to their intense labor and study, they often miss their homes thousands of miles away and look forward to fresh spiritual food. Zhang Daozhong deeply understands the feelings of the employees. He passionately demands that he give full play to his high level of professional efficiency to meet the needs of the employees, so that they can concentrate on accelerating the construction of the factory.

    In factories and construction sites, postmen usually only hand over mail to the person in charge of receiving and dispatching. These mails are placed on a shelf and are often damaged or lost due to wind and rain. Many workers have experienced the disappointment and pain of seeing only the envelope and not the letter paper. Zhang Daozhong put a lot of thought into delivering the letters to everyone. He has to deliver and collect four or five hundred pieces of mail and more than nine hundred copies of newspapers and periodicals every day. How can he ensure that it is not delayed and that no errors occur on such a wide and scattered construction site? He carefully studied the delivery route and made a set of cards according to the principle of shortening the distance and avoiding repetition. Before departure, he sorts the letters and newspapers according to the cards, and then puts them into the mailbag in order; then he uses the cards to separate the mail of each unit, so as to avoid delivery errors and waste of time. If there is a lot of mail in one unit, he plans to shorten the time when sending mail to the next unit. Therefore, although he has no watch, he can still arrive at a certain place at a certain time. Originally, the postman's duty did not include handling remittances, but Zhang Daozhong heard that the workers wanted to remit money to their families after being paid, but because they were busy with work and did not have time to go to the city, they often could not remit the money several times. So he took on the work of remittance and parcels, and each time he was responsible for returning the receipt to the sender. For this matter, the workers were very grateful and trusted him.

    Although the work is intense and busy, Zhang Daozhong is always so patient in helping people. Whenever he passes a place, workers often shout to him: "Old Zhang, I want to remit some money, but I haven't written the letter yet. When can I bring it to you today?" He always answers happily: Write it! I will definitely come to get it at such and such a time! Sure enough, when the time came, he also came, and in front of thousands of employees, he never forgot or broke his promise once. His work enthusiasm deeply touched the hearts of the workers. The class friendship between the workers and him quickly grew. Therefore, when the number of workers continued to increase, and the mail, newspapers and remittances in his hands became more and more, and he could not handle it alone, he had the help of the masses. He proposed that each construction site make small wooden mailboxes to replace the mailboxes, which was quickly approved; he entrusted the odd-job workers and accountants of each unit to sell stamps, subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, and handle remittances and insured letters, and they were all willing to assist. Cook Mei Jinfu even automatically bought more stamps and publications, and said to Zhang Daozhong: "This can save you time and also make it easier for us workers to send letters and buy books." In this way, the stamps sold by Zhang Daozhong reached more than 10 million yuan in the third quarter of last year, the circulation of newspapers in October increased five times compared with January, and the circulation of publications increased eighteen times.

    Now, Zhang Daozhong's spirit of serving the people has become a model for the workers on the construction site to learn from. His behavior greatly inspired the work enthusiasm of the employees. In September last year, he received a glorious banner presented by representatives of construction workers from ten units, and was affectionately called "the most beloved person" by thousands of employees, comparing him to a "mobile post office."

### 工地上的“活邮亭”

    工地上的“活邮亭”
    不论是烈日炎炎的夏天，风天雪地的严冬，或是大雨滂沱的日子，山西国营经纬纺织机械厂的工地上，有一个年轻的邮递员每天骑着自行车匆匆地到来。他来得那样准时，在每座工人宿舍的门口，工友们总可以按时等到他。他一到来，大批温暖的信、包裹和新的书报就从他的邮件袋里拿出来，送到工友们的手上；又从工友们手上，他带走了一封封给家属汇款的信……
    青年团员张道中奔走在这宽阔的工地上已经一年多了。当他瞧着正在修筑的厂房一天天改变着面貌，想到全国各处都将要盖起同样的大工厂时，他是多么神往于祖国未来的年代呵！……他把自己对祖国的热爱寄托在这个正在修筑的工厂上，恨不得它的汽笛早一天呜呜地叫起来。于是，从建厂开始，他就自动要求负责这个工地的邮递工作，以自己的力量为基本建设工地的职工服务。
    张道中所奔走的那个工地在离开县城六、七里路外偏僻的农村里，职工们多半来自上海。在紧张的劳动和学习以外，他们常常思念着远在几千里外的家，也盼望着新鲜的精神食粮。张道中深深理解到职工们的心情，他热烈地要求自己发挥高度的业务效能来满足职工的需要，让他们安心地把工厂加速修建好。
    在工厂、工地，邮递员一般只把邮件交给管收发的人。这些邮件放在一个架子上，常常因为风吹雨打就毁坏、遗失了。很多工人都体验过只见信皮不见信纸的失望和痛苦。张道中为了把信件送给每个人，用过很多心思。他每天要投收四、五百封邮件和九百多份报刊，在这样宽广而分散的工地上，怎样使得它不迟误而又不发生差错呢？他细心地研究了投递的路线，按着缩短距离和避免重复的原则，做了一套卡片。在出发前，他按卡片分拣信件和报纸，然后按次序放进信袋；再用卡片把各单位的邮件隔开，这样就可以避免投递错误和浪费时间。如果遇到一个单位邮件多了，他就在给下一个单位送信时有计划地缩短时间。所以他虽没有表，仍能在一定的时间到达一定的地方。本来，邮递员的职务里并没有办理汇款这一项，但张道中听说，工友们发薪后想把钱汇给家属，因工作忙，没时间进城，往往几次都汇不出去。于是他就兼办起汇款和包裹来，而且每次都负责地把收据送还给寄件人。为了这件事，工友们都非常感激和信任他。
    工作虽然紧张、繁忙，张道中却总是那样耐心地帮助人。每当他走过一个地方，常有工人这样喊他：“老张，我想汇笔款，只是信没写好，今天什么时候可给我带去？”他总是快乐地回答：你写吧！我一定在什么时候来取！果然，时间一到，人也来了，在几千职工的面前，他从来没有遗忘或失信过一次。他的工作热情深深地打动了工友们的心。工人和他之间的阶级友情很快地生长起来。所以，当工友不断增加，他手上的邮件、报刊和汇款一天比一天多，靠一个人忙不过来的时候，他便有了群众的帮助。他提议各工地自制木头的小信箱来代替邮箱，很快获得了赞同；他委托各单位的勤杂人员和会计代售邮票、订阅报刊、办理汇款和保价信时，他们都乐意协助。炊事员梅金富甚至自动多买些邮票、刊物，对张道中说：“这样可节省你的时间，也便利了我们工人寄信、买书。”这样，张道中售出的邮票在去年第三季度里就达到了一千余万元，报纸发行量在十月份就比一月份增加了五倍，刊物发行量竟增加了十八倍。
    现在，张道中的这种为人民服务的精神已经成为工地职工们学习的榜样。他的行为大大地鼓舞了职工的工作热情。在去年九月间，他得到了十个单位建筑职工代表赠送的光荣锦旗，被数千职工爱戴地称为“最可爱的人”，把他比喻为“活邮亭”。
