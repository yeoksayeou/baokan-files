Checking My Understanding of Basic Construction
Sun Jingbo, Deputy Director of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau

On December 24, 1952, the People's Daily criticized the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's tendency to neglect basic construction. This criticism prompted me to have a new understanding of the basic construction work of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau.

Checking from my own leadership ideology, my determination to "place basic construction in a primary position" was indeed not strong enough. This is reflected in many aspects:

First, the ideological preparation for strengthening basic construction was very inadequate. Placing basic construction in a primary position is a huge shift in our work. To achieve this shift, we first need to repeatedly conduct ideological mobilization of the broad masses of workers and staff, so that they have a full understanding of the great significance of basic construction. However, we only conducted a general mobilization on December 3, 1952, at the meeting of cadres above the section chief level of the newly established basic construction organization. We did not check the effect of the mobilization, nor did we continue to deeply implement this spirit among the cadres. We did not carry out ideological mobilization among the factories, mines, and the broad masses of workers and staff below the section chief level.

Second, I was not resolute in transferring personnel to establish the basic construction organization. The established basic construction organization was not strong enough compared to production, and the technical strength was also weaker than the production units. This was primarily because when I considered personnel issues, deep down I still unconsciously prioritized production over basic construction. Therefore, the determined list mostly involved transferring personnel from the basic construction organizations of factories and mines to the basic construction organization of the mining bureau, and not many were transferred from production. Even if not many were transferred, the responsible cadres of the factories and mines would still complain. When the cadres complained, I wavered because my own determination was not strong. The basic construction organization was only announced on December 3, 1952, and in reality, many people had not yet reported for duty. The actual work was still being carried out by some personnel from the original basic construction department of the mining bureau. The so-called new organization was, strictly speaking, just a name change for the original basic construction department. At that time, we were mainly busy doing investigation and determination work, hoping to comprehensively complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy through the investigation and determination work. At the same time, we were rushing to compile the 1953 plan, intending to let the transferred personnel go to the basic construction positions after the plan was completed.

Third, many preparatory works before construction were also carried out very slowly. For example, the civil engineering was completed at the end of November, and worker training only began after December 20.

In summary, although I paid more attention to basic construction work than in the past, I did not truly put it in a primary position. First of all, I did not truly understand why basic construction should be placed in a primary position. Everyone says that the complexity of basic construction work far exceeds that of production. However, I thought that the complexity of production exceeded that of basic construction. Based on the experience of the recovery and reconstruction period in recent years, I always thought that basic construction work was simple. Underground, it was just opening up roadways through faults; on the ground, it was just building houses. And production? In my mind, it was a series of complex problems. I had a deep experience and considered more thoroughly the difficulties in production, and I could not understand the complexity of basic construction. Starting from this perspective to consider problems and arrange work, there would naturally be deviations. When the cadres below complained about difficulties, I would naturally waver. Saying that basic construction is important, my understanding was also very general, only being able to recognize that without sinking wells, coal cannot be produced. These ideas came entirely from my narrow experience. In fact, as soon as I came into contact with basic construction issues, especially when considering long-term issues, I deeply felt the complexity of basic construction. In the next five years, the output of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau will increase by about 100%, but we do not yet have a complete and far-sighted overall design. The even more serious problem is that the underground coalfield conditions are unclear, and we have not yet broken through the drilling problem. The 1952 task was not well completed. If the 1953 drilling work is still like 1952, the development of Fengfeng in the next few years will be threatened. Can this be said that basic construction work is simpler than production?

Secondly, I simply focused on completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy. In the few years of working in the enterprise, I developed the concept of attaching importance to completing tasks, thinking that failing to complete production tasks was sabotaging the national plan. This is not right. However, I did not pay enough attention to basic construction work and did not understand that basic construction is related to a century-long plan and the future expanded reproduction. This gave rise to another confused thought. I thought that the construction season of 1952 had passed, and basic construction was a matter for 1953. For production, it was precisely relying on these one or two months of crash work to complete the task. Therefore, I felt that concentrating a large number of forces now was a waste, and it would be better to put them in production to play a greater role. This also shows that I have not deeply realized that the preparatory work of 1952 is related to the progress of basic construction in 1953.

An important reason for these confused thoughts is my bureaucratic leadership method. The bureaucratic leadership method made me neglect political study and fall into the quagmire of empiricism. In mid-November 1952, the director was transferred to the North China Coal Mine Administration. Although another deputy director was sent to be responsible for basic construction, he had just been transferred and was not yet familiar with the business. According to the importance of basic construction, it is very clear that I should organize and realize this shift with the greatest strength. However, I did not do this well enough and was busy all day with the daily routine of the ten or eleven departments of the bureau. My room was full of people coming and going, and I was extremely busy, but I did not grasp the key points of the work, and I did not intensify policy and theory study at this historic turning point, and I did not even bother to read the newspaper. How could I correctly understand the spirit of the Central Committee! This is a lesson that must be remembered.

### 检查我对基本建设的认识

    检查我对基本建设的认识
    峰峰矿务局副局长  孙镜波
    一九五二年十二月二十四日，人民日报对峰峰矿务局忽视基本建设的倾向进行了批评。这一批评促使我对峰峰矿务局的基本建设工作有了新的认识。
    从我自己的领导思想检查，“把基本建设放在首要地位”的决心，的确是不大的。这表现在许多方面：
    第一，加强基本建设的思想准备工作做得非常不够。把基本建设放在首要地位，在我们的工作中这是一个巨大的转变。要实现这一转变，首先需要对广大职工群众反复地进行思想动员，使他们对基本建设的重大意义有充分的认识，而我们呢，却只是在一九五二年十二月三日宣布成立基本建设机构的科长以上的干部会议上做了一次一般的动员。动员以后的效果如何，没有检查，也没有继续向干部们深入地贯彻这一精神。对各厂、矿，对科长级以下的广大职工群众，根本没有进行过思想动员。
    第二，对于抽调人员建立基本建设机构，我是不坚决的。已确定的基本建设机构比起生产来是不够强大的，技术力量也较生产单位薄弱。这首先是因为我自己在考虑人员问题时，思想深处仍然不自觉地是先生产后基本建设，因而，确定的名单中，大多还是从厂、矿基本建设机构中向矿务局的基本建设机构中抽调，从生产中抽的并不多。即使抽调得不多，厂、矿的负责干部们还是要喊叫的。干部们一喊叫，我就动摇了，因为我自己的决心并不大。基本建设机构直到一九五二年十二月三日才宣布成立，实际上许多人都未到职，具体进行工作的还是原来矿务局基本建设处的一些人员，所谓新的机构，严格地说只是原来的基本建设处变变名字而已。当时，我们主要在忙于做查定工作，希望通过查定工作全面地完成增产节约任务，同时在突击编制一九五三年的计划，打算作完了计划再使抽调的人到基本建设岗位上去。
    第三，施工前的许多准备工作也都进行得很迟缓，比如，土建工程十一月底就结束了，十二月二十日后才开始训练工人。
    总起来说，我对基本建设工作虽然比过去重视了，但是并没有真正放到首要地位。首先，为什么要把基本建设放在首要地位，我自己并没有真正认识。大家都说，基本建设工作的复杂性远远超过生产。我却以为生产的复杂性是超过基本建设的。根据这几年恢复改建时期的经验，我总想基本建设的工作是简单的，在井下，不过是通过断层开辟巷道；在地面上不过是盖盖房子而已。而生产呢？在我的脑子里却是一连串的复杂问题。对生产中的困难体验得深刻，考虑得较周到，对基本建设的复杂性不能理解。从这个角度出发来考虑问题安排工作自然要有偏差。下面干部一叫困难，我自然就要动摇了。说基本建设重要，我的了解也很一般，只能认识到不打井不能出煤而已。这些想法完全是从我的狭隘经验而来的。事实上，一接触到基本建设问题，特别是一考虑长远问题，就深深感到基本建设的复杂性了。峰峰矿务局在今后五年内，产量要增加一倍左右，而我们还没有一个完整的有远见的总体设计，更其严重的问题是地下煤田情况不明，而钻探问题我们始终还没有突破，一九五二年的任务完成得不好。假使一九五三年的钻探工作还像一九五二年一样，峰峰今后几年的发展就要受到威胁。这能说是基本建设工作比生产简单吗？
    其次，我单纯地注意完成增产节约任务。在企业工作的几年中养成了重视完成任务的观念，认为完不成生产任务就是破坏国家计划。这是不应该的。但是，对基本建设工作却注意得不够，不懂得基本建设关系百年大计，关系将来的扩大再生产问题。由此又产生了另外一个糊涂思想。我认为，一九五二年的施工季节已经过去，基本建设是一九五三年的事了。对于生产来说，却正是靠这一两个月突击来完成任务。于是，就觉得现在把大批力量集中起来是个浪费，不如放在生产方面更能发挥作用。这也说明了我还没有深刻认识一九五二年的准备工作关系着一九五三年基本建设的进度。
    产生这些糊涂思想的一个重要原因是我的事务主义的领导方法。事务主义的领导方法使我忽视了政治学习，陷入了经验主义的泥坑。一九五二年十一月中，局长被调到华北煤矿管理局了。虽然又派来了一位副局长分工管基本建设，但是他刚转业，业务还不熟悉。依基本建设的重要性来说，很清楚的，我是应该以最大的力量来组织实现这一转变的。但是我这样作得很不够，成天忙于全局十一个处的日常事务工作。我的屋子里人来人往，忙得不可开交，却没有抓住工作的重点，更没有在这个历史性的转变关头，加紧进行政策、理论学习，甚至连报纸也顾不上看。这如何能正确地体会中央的精神呢！这是一个必须记取的教训。
