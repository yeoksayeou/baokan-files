Vietnam News Agency Comments on the Vietnam War Situation
    Vietnam People's Army Strengthens Offensives
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 12th] Vietnam News Agency commented on the Vietnam War situation on the 11th, stating: In the Northern Vietnam plains, the Vietnam People's Army continues to strengthen its offensives, destroying many important enemy strongholds, and forcing them to retreat from many strongholds in the provinces of Nam Dinh, Ha Nam, Hung Yen, Hai Duong and Kien An. Many French military strongholds surrounded by the People's Army on the left bank of the Red River are still relying on airlift supplies.
    In order to salvage their predicament, the enemy concentrated their mobile forces and launched "mopping-up" operations south of Nam Dinh and west of Bui Chu. The People's Army annihilated more than 800 enemy troops, causing a serious setback to the enemy's "mopping-up" operations.
    In Central and Southern Vietnam, the People's Army continues to attack the enemy's main transportation lines, creating many difficulties for the enemy.

    越南通讯社评论越南战况
    越南人民军加强进攻
    【新华社十二日讯】越南通讯社十一日在评论越南战况时说：在北越平原，越南人民军继续加强进攻，摧毁了许多敌人的重要据点，并迫使他们从南定、河南、兴安、海阳和建安等省的许多据点撤退。在红河左岸遭受人民军包围的许多法军据点，仍然依赖空运接济。
    为了挽救他们的困境，敌人集中了他们的机动兵力，向南定以南和裴朱以西地区发动“扫荡”。人民军歼灭敌军八百名以上，使敌人的“扫荡”遭受到严重的挫折。
    在中越和南越，人民军继续攻击敌人的主要交通线，给敌人造成了许多困难。
