Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 26th: An exhibition on the U.S. government's crimes of germ warfare, jointly sponsored by the Peace Committees of China and Germany and the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany for Aid to Korea, officially opened on the 24th in the "Berolina" building on Alexanderplatz in the center of Berlin.

Professor Linser, Chairman of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany for Aid to Korea, delivered the opening speech. He said, "This exhibition of irrefutable evidence is a severe indictment and angry denunciation of a handful of thugs."

Bai Xiqing, head of the Chinese delegation hosting the exhibition, gave a detailed account of the U.S. military's heinous germ warfare in Korea and China, and called on the people of the world to take immediate action to stop these crimes. He also stated that the Chinese people are determined to fight alongside peace-loving people all over the world to safeguard humanity and civilization and oppose the crimes of the American imperialists.

Louis Böle Staudte, Minister of Health of the German Democratic Republic, spoke on behalf of the German scientific and medical community, calling on everyone to intensify their efforts to stop the barbarous acts of American imperialism.

Among those attending the opening ceremony were: Dr. Erich Correns, Chairman of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany; Karl Flogge, Secretary-General of the German Association for Foreign Cultural Relations; Wilhelmine Schirmer-Pröscher, member of the Presidium of the German Peace Committee; prominent figures from the German scientific and medical fields; and representatives from many mass organizations, as well as personnel from the diplomatic missions of the Soviet Union and various People's Democracies. Ji Pengfei, head of the diplomatic mission of the People's Republic of China, also attended the opening ceremony.

The day before the opening of the exhibition, the Chinese delegation responsible for the exhibition held a press conference at the National Front Building of the German Democratic Republic on Thälmannplatz. More than 100 German and foreign news agency and newspaper reporters from the democratic sector of Berlin and West Berlin attended the press conference.

The press conference was presided over by Professor Linser, who pointed out that the exhibition provided undeniable evidence of the towering crimes committed by the American warmongers.

Reporters from newspapers and news agencies in the German Democratic Republic raised many questions about the U.S. military's crimes of germ warfare and other atrocities. They asked how the U.S. military, with the help of Japanese germ warfare criminals, carried out heinous germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people, how the Chinese people helped the Korean people carry out epidemic prevention work, and why the U.S. government refused to pass the Soviet proposal requiring all national governments to recognize the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and so on.

The representatives of the Chinese delegation answered these questions in detail.

Reporters from the American, British, French, and West German news agencies and radio stations remained silent.
