    Pengshui County People's Court Should Not Delay Handling the Case of Woman's Murder

    Editor: The People's Court of Pengshui County, Sichuan Province, has been delaying the handling of a woman's murder. After Liao Tingzhen married Dai Yuanzhi in 1949, her mother-in-law, Dai Xiong, disliked her for being "short" and incited her son to dislike her as well, sometimes hitting her with a hoe. Later, Dai Yuanzhi fell in love with another woman and planned to murder Liao Tingzhen. On May 8th of last year, Dai Yuanzhi feigned illness. In the middle of the night, Dai Xiong tricked Liao Tingzhen into getting up to "pick plums to eat," and together with her son, they strangled Liao Tingzhen with a rope and threw her body into a large pit. The next morning, Dai Xiong acted like a spirit, wailing and crying, saying that her daughter-in-law had been "dragged away by a tiger," and tricked the township head Zhao Deshun into gathering many people to search everywhere. On the third day, Liao Tingzhen's body was found in a pit seventeen zhang deep, with the rope still tied around the deceased's neck. Dai Yuanzhi, on the other hand, was pretending to have a "malaria attack" inside the house. On May 11th of last year, the county People's Court went to examine the body and found it covered with injuries. The masses unanimously demanded that the murderers be severely punished. The county People's Court immediately arrested Dai Yuanzhi and his mother. But for some reason, it has not been dealt with until now. Also, the case of Liao Youdi, a woman from Huoshi Township, Pengshui County, who was pushed into a rock pit by her mother-in-law in June 1951, was only arrested by the county People's Court in July of last year. But even now, no final decision has been made. Furthermore, the cases of Hu Yongbi, a woman who was pushed into a rock pit in May of last year, and Chen Guoxiang, a woman who was pushed off a cliff in October of last year, have not been dealt with by the Pengshui County People's Court. In total, thirteen cases of women being murdered occurred in Pengshui County last year, which is inseparable from the serious procrastination of the Pengshui County People's Court. It is suggested that the Fuling Special District Branch of the Sichuan Provincial People's Court quickly investigate and deal with the matter.

    彭水县人民法院对于妇女被杀害案件不该拖延不处理
    编辑同志：四川省彭水县人民法院对妇女被杀害事件拖延不理。妇女廖廷贞，一九四九年和戴元治结婚后，婆婆戴熊氏嫌她“身材不高”，并挑拨儿子也嫌弃她，有时用锄头打她。后来戴元治爱上别的妇女，就对廖廷贞有了谋害的打算。去年五月八日，戴元治装病。半夜里，戴熊氏骗廖廷贞起来去“摘李子吃”，她就和儿子一起用绳子把廖廷贞勒死，把尸体甩到一大坑里。第二天早上，戴熊氏装神装鬼、大哭大啼，说她的媳妇“被老虎拖去了”，骗使乡长赵德顺集合起许多人到处搜找。第三天，从十七丈深的大坑里找到了廖廷贞的尸首，绳子还结在死者颈子上。而戴元治却又在屋里装
    “打闷头摆子”（疟疾）。去年五月十一日，县人民法院去验尸，发见死者满身都是伤。群众一致要求严惩凶手。县人民法院当即把戴元治母子扣捕起来。但不知为什么到现在还没有处理？还有，彭水县火石乡妇女廖有弟，一九五一年六月被婆婆推下岩坑去的事件，去年七月，县人民法院才把凶手逮捕。但也直到现在还没有作最后处理。又，去年五月里，妇女胡永碧被推下岩坑的事件，去年十月里妇女陈国香被推下岩的事件，彭水县人民法院都还没有处理。总计去年一年内，彭水县一共发生十三起妇女被杀害的事件，这是和彭水县人民法院严重的拖拉作风分不开的。建议四川省人民法院涪陵专区分院赶快检查处理。　李大志
