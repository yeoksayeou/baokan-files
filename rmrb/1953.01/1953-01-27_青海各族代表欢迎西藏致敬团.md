Xinhua News Agency report: A welcome reception was held in Xining on the 19th by representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors of Qinghai Province to welcome the Tibetan Delegation. Zhang Zhongliang, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, delivered a welcoming speech. He said: Qinghai, the motherland, is the birthplace of Master Tsongkhapa and the home of the present Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni. In the past three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the connection between Qinghai and Tibet has seen new developments. The visit of the Tibetan Delegation to Qinghai will further strengthen this connection. Liu Xia·Tudengtaba, the head of the Tibetan Delegation, delivered a reply speech. He said: We came from Tibet to visit the interior of the motherland and have personally witnessed the great achievements in all aspects of the country's construction under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In particular, the people's governments at all levels have resolutely implemented the ethnic policies and protected religious temples, which has further strengthened our unwavering confidence in freedom of religious belief. After we return, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Southwest Military and Political Committee, with the close unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, we will work together to implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The Tibetan Delegation also presented gifts to the Qinghai Provincial People's Government on behalf of Panchen Erdeni.
