The People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
Circular on Strengthening the Organizational Leadership of Public Grain Transportation and Storage Work, and Avoiding Casualties

Recently, the Supervision Committees of the Central South and Southwest Administrative Regions and the People's Government of Jilin Province have reported that serious accidents involving deaths and injuries have repeatedly occurred in the work of transporting and storing public grain in various regions in 1952, and livestock losses have also been high. In Jilin Province, 123 people were killed or injured and 69 livestock were killed or injured during the process of delivering grain to warehouses, and 51 carts were damaged. Except for Yechun County, which had no accidents for two years, accidents occurred in all other counties in the province. In the most serious case, in Nongan County, an average of one person died for every 4,250 tons of grain stored. In the Central South region, according to incomplete statistics from only four provinces, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, 13 people died, 69 were injured, and 36 livestock were killed or injured during the delivery of grain to warehouses. In Guizhou Province, according to sporadic statistics, 57 people were killed or injured during the delivery of grain to warehouses. Analysis of the causes of the accidents reveals that: First, some district and township cadres have a simplistic task-oriented view and are eager for quick results. They only emphasize early delivery and fast delivery, and require all people, regardless of age, weakness, illness, or pregnancy, to deliver grain, resulting in deaths and injuries. Second, there is a lack of specific organizational leadership in the transportation of public grain. Some areas do not assign capable cadres to take charge of leadership, but simply order the masses to deliver the grain themselves without organization. Others, although organized, have transportation team leaders who are rotated by the masses and do not actually play a role, leading to chaos, crowding, and competition for vehicles during the delivery of grain. The practice of allowing individual carts to return unsupervised after delivery leads to speeding and collisions, causing deaths and injuries. Third, there is a lack of strict planning for the delivery of grain to warehouses. Some areas mobilize the masses to deliver grain blindly, regardless of warehouse capacity or the number of people available for grain collection. Others, although having delivery plans, do not dispatch vehicles according to the plan, but blindly rush to complete tasks, resulting in crowding, fighting, and injuries during grain delivery, or causing the grain-delivering masses to lose work and go hungry. Fourth, there is a lack of ideological education on safe transportation for the grain-delivering masses. Some cadres and the masses believe that they have "several years of grain transportation experience" and become complacent and careless. Some only focus on formal team formation and grouping, but do not educate the masses on the superstitious "fate" ideology of "dying in a well or not dying in a river," leading to deaths and injuries due to the masses' recklessness and taking chances. For example, in Jilin Province, 94 out of 116 death and injury accidents, accounting for 81 percent, were caused by ideological carelessness and "mao che" (accidents caused by frightened horses). Fifth, there is a lack of serious inspection of warehouse safety equipment and roads and bridges, leading to the masses falling from buildings during grain pouring, warehouse collapses, or road and bridge collapses causing deaths and injuries. Sixth, and most importantly, county-level leading cadres lack sufficient understanding of the importance of protecting the lives and property of the people. Some simply assign task numbers and neglect to explain the discipline of grain transportation, the safety of grain transportation and storage, and the organizational leadership practices. Others only make arrangements and lack timely in-depth inspection and specific guidance, resulting in a constant stream of death and injury accidents. The People's Government of Jilin Province discussed and arranged for safe grain transportation before the collection, and promptly stopped grain delivery for inspection after discovering a grain transportation accident in Yongji County. It also held an emergency meeting of the Finance and Grain Section to study and improve measures, issued a circular on rectifying transportation organizations and strengthening leadership, and dispatched ten inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections again before starting grain delivery again. This greatly reduced the number of death and injury accidents, from an average of 7.7 people per day to an average of 2 people per day. This shows that as long as the leadership attaches importance and strengthens its organizational leadership, death and injury accidents can be reduced and eliminated. Although what they have done is not enough, it is a direction worthy of emulation.

Although the grain storage work in most areas is nearing completion, some areas are still continuing to store grain, and some areas are preparing to store grain. In order to avoid the recurrence of death and injury accidents in the transportation and storage of public grain in various places in the future, in addition to requiring the People's Government of Jilin Province to promptly and seriously compile the experience of Yechun County in having no accidents in grain delivery for two years and the lessons of serious casualties in Nongan County and report them to this Committee for introduction to various places as learning materials, we hereby propose the following measures based on the above analysis, and instruct all provinces and counties to strengthen the organizational leadership of grain delivery and storage work: (1) Require all provinces and counties to carefully inspect the grain delivery and storage work of their subordinate districts and townships, learn from experience, commend and promote good practices, criticize and educate bad practices, arouse the vigilance of cadres, investigate the responsibility for serious accidents and handle them appropriately, and properly bury and compensate for deaths and injuries, and provide appropriate compensation for livestock losses. (2) All provinces that continue to store grain must assign inspection teams to inspect each county, and county magistrates and financial and grain personnel must personally go deep into districts, townships, transportation teams, and warehouses for inspection, explain practices, stipulate discipline, and earnestly handle any problems discovered; and instruct district and township and warehouse cadres to divide the work at each level and clearly delineate the scope of responsibility to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined. Before delivering grain, inspect and repair dangerous roads, bridges, and warehouses in advance, formulate grain storage plans, set delivery dates for each district and township, ensure that grain is received upon arrival, and supervise the conscientious implementation; when delivering grain, designate village cadres to lead the team, inspect and rectify transportation organizations, prohibit old, weak, sick, and pregnant people from delivering grain, and establish public covenants for transporting public grain. (3) During the period of grain delivery and storage, widely publicize the experiences and lessons of death and injury accidents in grain delivery to the masses, and use various forms to educate and criticize the masses' complacency, carelessness, and superstitious "fate" thinking, in order to avoid accidents.

It must be emphasized that protecting the lives and property of the people is consistent with the completion of work tasks. Cadres at all levels of government must strive to complete work tasks under the principle of protecting the lives and property of the people. If this principle is violated and death and injury accidents occur, causing unwarranted losses to the people's property, even if the task numbers are completed, it is still a serious mistake. We hope that cadres at all levels will raise serious vigilance. This is hereby notified.

    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    关于加强公粮运输、入仓工作的组织领导，避免死伤事故的通报
    近据中南、西南两大行政区监察委员会及吉林省人民政府反映，各地在一九五二年公粮运输入仓工作中屡次发生死伤人命的惨重事故，牲畜损失亦多。吉林省在送粮入仓中死伤一百二十三人，死伤牲畜六十九头，损毁大车五十一辆。该省除烨春县最好，两年未发生事故外，其余各县均有发生，最严重的农安县，竟至平均入仓四千二百五十吨即死亡一人。中南仅据河南、湖南、湖北、江西等四省的不完全统计，送粮入仓中死十三人、伤六十九人，死伤牲畜三十六头。贵州省仅从零星材料统计，送粮入仓中死伤五十七人。分析事故发生的原因；第一、由于区乡干部存在单纯任务观点急于求成，只强调早交、快交，不分老、弱、病、孕一律让其送粮，造成死伤。第二、公粮运输工作缺乏具体组织领导。有的不配备得力干部掌握领导，只令群众自送不加组织。有的虽有组织但运输队长由群众轮流担任，实际不起作用，致送粮中发生抢车争先拥挤混乱，交粮后放任单车零归发生飞跑撞车造成死伤。第三、送粮入仓均缺乏严密计划。有的不管仓库容量大小、收粮人力多少，盲目动员群众送粮；有的虽订有送接计划，但不按计划出车，盲目突击任务，致发生交粮拥挤、抢称打架受伤或使送粮群众误工挨饿现象。第四、对送粮群众缺乏安全运输的思想教育工作。有的从干部到群众都以为“有几年运粮经验”而产生自满的麻痹大意情绪；有的只顾形式的编队编组，不对群众“该在井里死、河里死不了”的迷信“命运”思想进行教育，致使群众的逞能侥幸造成死伤。如吉林省一百一十六件死伤事故中因思想麻痹及毛车（即因马惊而出事故）发生的就有九十四件，占百分之八十一。第五、对仓库安全设备及道路桥梁缺乏认真检查，以致灌仓时群众失足坠楼或仓房倒塌或路上崖壁、桥梁坍垮造成死伤。第六、特别重要的是县级领导干部对保护人民生命财产的重要性认识不足。有的单纯交代任务数字，对运粮纪律、运输入仓安全及组织领导的做法忽视交代；有的只有布置、缺乏及时深入检查和具体指导，致下面死伤事故层出不穷。吉林省人民政府在征收前对安全运粮做了讨论布置，发现永吉县运粮事故后及时停止送粮进行检查，又开财粮科长紧急会议研究改进办法，发出整顿运输组织加强领导的通报，并派十个检查组再次深入检查，然后开始重新送粮，使死伤事故大量减少，由每日平均七点七人降至每日平均二人。这就说明只要领导上重视并加强其组织领导，死伤事故是可以减少和消除的。他们做得虽然还不够，却是一个值得效法的方向。
    目前大部地区公粮入仓虽已接近结束，但有些地区尚在继续入仓，有些地区正在准备入仓，为避免各地今后在公粮运输入仓中再度发生死伤人命事故，除要求吉林省人民政府将烨春县两年送粮无事故的经验及农安县严重伤亡事故的教训，迅速认真整理报经本委介绍各地作为学习材料外，特根据上述分析，提出如下办法责成各省、县加强送粮入仓工作的组织领导：（一）要求各省、县认真检查所属区乡的送粮入仓工作吸取经验，好的表扬推广，不好的批评教育，引起干部警惕，事故严重的追究责任适当处理，并对人命死伤妥慎安葬抚恤，对牲畜损失予以适当赔偿。（二）凡有继续送粮入仓的各省，须指派检查组到各县巡视检查，县长、财粮科人员更要亲自深入区乡、运输队、仓库进行检查，交代做法、规定纪律，发现问题认真处理；并责成区乡、仓库干部层层分工，明确划分责任范围，以专责成。送粮以前预先检查整修险要道路、桥梁和仓库，制订入仓计划，定好各区乡送接日期，做到随到随收，督促认真执行；送粮时指定乡村干部带队，检查整顿运输组织，不许老、弱、病、孕群众送粮，订立运送公粮公约。（三）在送粮入仓期间，要对群众广泛宣传送粮死伤事故的经验教训，针对群众的麻痹大意和侥幸、迷信“命运”等思想，利用各种形式进行教育批判，以避免事故发生。
    必须着重指出：保护人民生命财产是与完成工作任务相一致的，各级政府干部都必须在保护人民生命财产的原则下求得完成工作任务。如果违反这个原则造成死伤人命事故，肇致人民财产的不应有损失，纵然完成任务数字，仍是严重错误，务望各级干部提起严重警惕。特此通报。
