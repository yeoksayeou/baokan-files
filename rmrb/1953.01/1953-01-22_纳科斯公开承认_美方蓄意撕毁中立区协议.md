    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: Nacos, who formerly served as the spokesman for the US side's armistice negotiation delegation, publicly admitted that the US side was unwilling to resume armistice negotiations at Panmunjom. According to the Associated Press, Nacos, on his way to Europe to serve as the head of the press office for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive bloc, told reporters in San Francisco on the 19th that "The Korean armistice negotiations will absolutely not be resumed in the same place." Nacos's remarks fully demonstrate that the US side's recent series of actions to sabotage the neutral zone and conference area agreements were completely a long-planned step, the purpose of which was to completely tear up these remaining agreements, abolish the neutral zone and conference area, making it impossible to resume armistice negotiations and ultimately causing them to completely break down.

    纳科斯公开承认
    美方蓄意撕毁中立区协议
     【新华社开城二十一日电】曾经担任美方停战谈判代表团发言人的纳科斯，公开承认美方不愿在板门店恢复停战谈判。据美联社报道，纳科斯在他前往欧洲担任北大西洋公约侵略集团新闻处长的途中，十九日在旧金山招待记者时说，“朝鲜停战谈判绝对不会在原地恢复。”纳科斯的谈话，充分证明美方最近一连串破坏中立区和会场区协议的行为，完全是一种预谋已久的步骤，其目的是要彻底撕毁这些仅存的协议，取消中立区和会场区，使停战谈判无法恢复而最后完全破裂。
