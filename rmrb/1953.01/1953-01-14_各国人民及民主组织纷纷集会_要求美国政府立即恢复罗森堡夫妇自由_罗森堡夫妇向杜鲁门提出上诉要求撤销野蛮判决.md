Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: People in various countries are continuing to protest the U.S. government's conspiracy to murder the peace-loving and kind citizens, the Rosenbergs, under the falsely accused charge of "espionage," demanding the cancellation of this barbaric verdict and the immediate restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom.

The World Federation of Trade Unions issued an appeal to workers of all countries and all people of conscience on the 12th, pointing out that the Rosenberg case is a conspiracy by the U.S. government to frantically prepare for war. The appeal calls on people around the world to step up protests to the U.S. government and take various actions to save the lives of the innocent Rosenbergs. The World Federation of Trade Unions also sent a telegram to Truman demanding the immediate release of the Rosenbergs.

The broad masses of the Romanian people expressed great indignation at this despicable conspiracy by the U.S. government. Romanian newspapers and radio stations continue to receive thousands of letters, sent from groups or individuals of all nationalities and all walks of life across the country, unanimously lodging solemn protests against the fascist verdict of the U.S. court.

People in various parts of the German Democratic Republic have also held mass rallies, demanding the restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom. 50,000 citizens of Rostock held a protest rally. Hans Warnke, Chairman of the Rostock People's Representatives Council, said at the meeting: The verdict against the Rosenbergs is a brutal means used by the U.S. imperialists to cover up their preparations for a third world war. "This planned murder is one of the war-mongers' attempts to launch a new massacre against the people of the world." The conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding the release of the Rosenbergs. Citizens of Berlin held a rally at the Friedrich Palace to protest the U.S. government's vicious conspiracy to murder the Rosenbergs. The Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany also sent a telegram to Truman demanding the restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom.

In West Germany, forty-five prominent public figures organized the "Committee to Save the Rosenbergs," calling on the West German people to protest the U.S. judicial authorities' despicable plan to murder the Rosenbergs. The committee received a continuous stream of protest letters from the West German people. The Committee on All-German Issues in Hamburg and the Committee for the Defense of Democratic Rights in Hamburg and other people's organizations wrote to President Truman, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Consulate in Hamburg, demanding the release of the innocent Rosenbergs.

In France, the "Committee to Defend the Rosenbergs" held mass rallies in Paris and various provinces, and lodged protests with the U.S. Embassy and consulates.

In the United States, people continue to march in front of the White House, demanding the cancellation of the verdict against the Rosenbergs. Many celebrities made the same request to Truman. The famous atomic scientist Einstein also wrote to Truman, saying, "My conscience compels me to ask you to commute the death sentence of the Rosenbergs."

Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: Washington News: The Rosenbergs, who were sentenced to death by the U.S. judicial authorities on trumped-up charges, appealed to Truman on the 10th, requesting Truman to use presidential power to revoke the purely framed verdict against them.

In their appeal, the Rosenbergs reiterated that they are innocent and therefore have nothing to "confess" or "repent." They also said: They are both still young and are very willing to see their two sons grow up, so they want to live, but they can never exchange their lives for betraying the truth. Although facing imminent execution, they are not prepared to abandon their ideals.

The Rosenbergs have consistently pleaded from the beginning of the trial that they are completely innocent and that they only support the ideals of peace and democracy. However, the U.S. judicial authorities stubbornly insisted that they committed "espionage" with fundamentally untenable charges and completely fabricated testimony, and also insisted that they refused to "repent" and rejected all requests for retrial.

    各国人民及民主组织纷纷集会
    要求美国政府立即恢复罗森堡夫妇自由
    罗森堡夫妇向杜鲁门提出上诉要求撤销野蛮判决
    【新华社十三日讯】各国人民正继续抗议美国政府以诬加的“间谍”罪名，阴谋杀害爱好和平的善良公民罗森堡夫妇，要求取消这个野蛮的判决，立即恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。
    世界工联在十二日发表了致各国工人及一切有良心的人的呼吁书，指出罗森堡夫妇案件是美国政府疯狂准备战争的一个阴谋。呼吁书号召全世界人民加紧向美国政府提出抗议，用种种行动来拯救无辜的罗森堡夫妇的生命。世界工联并致电杜鲁门要求立即释放罗森堡夫妇。
    罗马尼亚广大人民对美国政府这一个卑鄙的阴谋表示了极大的愤怒。罗马尼亚的报纸和无线电台继续收到成千的信，这些发自全国各地各民族、各阶层的团体或个人的信一致对美国法院的法西斯判决提出严正的抗议。
    德意志民主共和国各地人民也纷纷举行群众大会，要求恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。罗斯托克五万市民举行了抗议大会。罗斯托克人民代表会议主席汉斯·瓦恩克在会上说：对罗森堡夫妇的判决是美帝国主义者的一种残暴手段，用来掩盖他们进行第三次世界大战的准备。“这一有计划的谋杀，是战争贩子们对世界人民发动一次新屠杀的企图之一。”大会一致通过决议，要求释放罗森堡夫妇。柏林的市民在腓特烈宫举行了大会，抗议美国政府残杀罗森堡夫妇的毒辣阴谋。民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团也致电杜鲁门要求恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。
    在西德，四十五位著名的公众领袖组织了“拯救罗森堡夫妇委员会”，号召西德人民抗议美国司法当局谋杀罗森堡夫妇的卑鄙计划。委员会收到西德人民源源不断的抗议信件。汉堡全德问题委员会与汉堡保卫民主权利委员会等人民团体写信给杜鲁门总统、美国最高法院及美国驻汉堡领事馆，要求释放无辜的罗森堡夫妇。
    在法国，“保卫罗森堡委员会”在巴黎和各省召开群众大会，并向美国大使馆及领事馆提出了抗议。
    在美国国内，人民继续在白宫前游行，要求取消对罗森堡夫妇的判决。许多社会名流向杜鲁门提出同样要求。著名原子科学家爱因斯坦也写信给杜鲁门说：“我的良心驱使我要求你免除罗森堡夫妇的死刑。”
    【新华社十三日讯】华盛顿消息：被美国司法当局以莫须有罪名判处死刑的罗森堡夫妇十日向杜鲁门提出上诉，要求杜鲁门使用总统权力，撤销对他们的纯粹陷害性质的判决。
    罗森堡夫妇在上诉书中再次声明他们是无罪的，因此也没有什么可以“招认”或是“悔过”。他们还说：他们都还年青，而且极愿意看到自己的两个儿子长大成人，因此他们要活，但他们绝不能以背叛真理来换得自己的生命。虽然面临着迫近的死刑，他们也不准备放弃他们的理想。
    罗森堡夫妇从审判开始就始终申诉说他们完全是没有罪的，他们只是拥护和平和民主的理想。但是美国司法当局却以根本不能成立的罪名和完全假造的见证，蛮横地咬定他们犯了“间谍罪”，还硬说他们拒绝“悔过”，并且拒绝了一切重审的要求。
