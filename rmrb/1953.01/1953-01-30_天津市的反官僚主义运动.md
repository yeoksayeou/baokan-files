    Anti-Bureaucracy Movement in Tianjin
    Lin Qing
    Since late October of last year, Tianjin has extensively carried out an anti-bureaucracy movement in factories, enterprises, municipal government departments, and people's mass organizations throughout the city, and has achieved great results.
    Since the liberation of Tianjin, the work of various units has been remarkably successful. After previous political movements and a series of democratic reforms, these units have basically transformed the bureaucratic organs that used to serve a small number of reactionary rulers into organizations serving the people, and have established many scientific working methods and systems, thus achieving today's accomplishments. However, due to the remnants of old ideas among some leading cadres and the influence of bourgeois ideology after entering the city, coupled with a lack of sound democratic life and ideological struggle within, bureaucratic work styles are still very serious. At the end of August last year, Tianjin held its first Party Congress, which, through the typical "Yang Yuehui Incident" (Yang Yuehui was a female worker at the Tianjin private Huayang Tobacco Factory who spent one year and three months, traveling to fourteen different agencies a total of fifty-nine times, in order to report a counter-revolutionary element, and finally received proper handling during the "Three-Anti" movement), exposed and criticized bureaucracy. This typical incident profoundly reflected the seriousness of bureaucracy in some organs in Tianjin, and thus the meeting unanimously approved the decision of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to launch a campaign against bureaucracy. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government jointly formed an anti-bureaucracy office as a unified leadership organization.
    The movement has been underway for more than two months and has yielded great gains. The movement adopted the approach of "combining top-down inspection with bottom-up criticism," and on the basis of conscious participation of cadres at all levels, a large number of problems have been exposed. For example, Wei Chen, the director of the canned food factory under the Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau, was seriously irresponsible in his work. The factory had neither a scientific inspection system nor scientific product specifications, relying solely on "knocking and listening" to determine the quality of canned goods. Those that could not be judged were classified as "squatting products," thrown into warehouses, and allowed to rot and spoil. As a result, over the two years from February 1950 to June of last year, more than 223,000 cans of canned goods were damaged. Adding the damage from July to September of last year, the total loss to the state reached 4.9 billion yuan. During the "Three-Anti" period, workers had raised concerns about the above situation, but Wei Chen ignored them, believing that "the factory earns a lot, so losing a little doesn't matter." In July last year, the factory suffered serious industrial accidents in which 28 workers were injured and one deputy engineer was killed in a single day, which was also inseparable from Wei Chen's bureaucratic work style. The Tianjin Coal Industry Building Materials Company had previously filled a pit with nearly a thousand tons of coal dust, and another 30,000 tons of coal had partially self-ignited, which was only discovered in this anti-bureaucracy movement. The tram company, when building a tram line, did not conduct a preliminary survey or research. After building half of it, they discovered that the roadbed was unsuitable and the traffic was congested, so they had to dismantle it. The Municipal Engineering Bureau built a bridge in Haiguang Temple, but due to the leadership's lack of oversight and the subjective assumptions of the designers, they discovered after it was built that ships could not pass through. In government offices, procrastination and red tape were also quite common and serious. The Fourth Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau had more than 800 cases that had been backlogged for more than a year without being processed. The Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government had to go through twenty-four procedures within its own department to issue a document or notice. One person applied to the Real Estate Administration Bureau to repair a dangerous building, and the various departments of the bureau "forwarded" the application to each other, and it was not resolved for half a year. Similar facts are too numerous to mention.
    The exposure of these problems shocked many cadres and gave them a preliminary understanding of the serious harm of bureaucracy. On this basis, various units extensively launched ideological criticism. Through layer-by-layer self-criticism by leading cadres and mutual criticism and self-criticism between superiors and subordinates, understanding became more consistent and improved.
    On this basis, the focus of the movement shifted to construction work. At this time, on the one hand, bureaucratic elements with serious circumstances who refused to repent were strictly dealt with (such as Wei Chen, who was administratively dismissed and whose probationary membership in the Party was revoked). At the same time, based on the problems that were revealed during the inspection, after analysis and research, the main problems were identified, and then the masses were mobilized to discuss and formulate improvement measures. The first step was to strengthen political and ideological leadership, improve democratic life, and fully develop criticism and self-criticism. Units that did not have a deputy who specialized in political work in the past have re-divided their responsibilities so that the leadership of political work and business work each have their own responsibilities, but can also be closely integrated. Many units have also established and improved various political work systems, providing organizational guarantees for strengthening democratic life and fully developing criticism and self-criticism in the future. In order to fundamentally overcome bureaucracy, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also made a decision to universally strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, stipulating that senior cadres should spend two and a half days a week to concentrate on studying theory. The theoretical study of general cadres has also been greatly strengthened. At present, many units have made achievements, and the atmosphere of learning among cadres is becoming increasingly strong. Secondly, in terms of establishing and improving various systems, the achievements are even more significant. For example, the strengthening of the responsibility system, the inspection system, and the supervision system has made a lot of progress. In the factory and enterprise sectors, in addition to strengthening the inspection and acceptance systems in some units where they were not sound, labor protection work has received widespread attention. In order to reduce and eliminate industrial accidents, the Municipal Water Company has improved the organization of the Safety and Health Committee and strengthened the labor protection organization in the workshops. Some factories have also added safety and health equipment to improve the welfare of employees. In the financial and trade sectors, in addition to gradually establishing a responsibility system at all levels by the general manager and deputy general manager, the Tianjin Coal Industry Building Materials Company has also decided to establish a regular inspection system. In order to prevent grain from being harmed by insects, the Tianjin Grain Company has formulated a series of improvement measures, preparing to gradually establish a storage system, and will also establish original inspection, safety inspection, and insect and mold inspection systems. In government agencies, they are generally studying how to overcome the problem of red tape and formulating new methods. Since the implementation of the new system, the file section of the Document Division of the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has improved its work efficiency by more than double. In the past, the entire section of six people received about 80 documents a day, but now four people can handle more than 110 documents a day. Many units have significantly strengthened the work of receiving the people and handling people's letters, and the phenomena of backlog and procrastination have begun to be overcome, and general problems can be handled in a timely manner.
    Through the anti-bureaucracy movement, not only has the leadership been effectively improved, the work has been improved, but also the masses have been educated, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been strengthened, and the connection between the government and the masses has been strengthened. The vast number of cadres have generally improved a step in ideology, politics, and work. The leading cadres of many factories have strengthened the idea of relying on workers, and the phenomena of "valuing machines over people" and "only wanting production and not safety" have been fundamentally reversed. Many leading cadres often contact lower-level cadres, discover and solve problems. The water company had 12 industrial accidents in June last year, but since the anti-bureaucracy movement, it has been significantly reduced, and none occurred in November. The number of rationalization proposals from employees is increasing day by day. Employees in the military supply system put forward a total of 669 opinions in the movement, of which 409 have been resolved. The defect rate of the pipe-making factory of the Municipal Engineering Bureau used to be 17%, but due to the further increase in the production enthusiasm of employees, it has now dropped to 0.9%. Many technicians also criticized the idea that "technology has nothing to do with politics" during the movement.
    During the anti-bureaucracy movement in Tianjin, the leading cadres of most units have been able to face up to their mistakes, set an example by conducting in-depth self-criticism, and drive the lower-level cadres to conduct layer-by-layer self-criticism, and the enthusiasm of the masses has always been high. This is the key to carrying out the movement. However, there are also a few leading cadres, such as Gu Zhu and Li Zhongyuan, deputy directors of the Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau, who are unwilling to humbly examine themselves, holding the idea of "getting through the ordeal," and thus passively coping and attempting to end it hastily. Lower-level cadres do not know what these leading cadres are planning, so they have many concerns and hesitate to move forward, and the progress of the movement is very slow. Some leading cadres, such as Zhou Jian, manager of the China Medical Company, even used the excuse that exposing their mistakes would "lose the prestige of the leadership" to perversely suppress criticism; others are complacent and ignore the criticism of the masses, and complain and get angry, such as Meng Deli, manager of the Tianjin branch of the China Medical Company. Regarding these phenomena, the municipal leadership organs promptly conducted strict criticism, clearly pointing out that the main responsibility for the existence of bureaucracy lies with the leading cadres, so the anti-bureaucracy movement must first target the leading cadres. At the same time, it was emphasized that this anti-bureaucracy movement must be thorough and complete, and there is no way to get away with it. They were called upon to take active action, first set an example, and launch this struggle. Those who were complacent and passively resisted were resolutely given severe blows to clear the obstacles to the movement, so that the movements in these units could also be carried out quickly and healthily.
    Secondly, it is also very necessary to analyze and criticize the unhealthy thoughts of lower-level cadres in a timely manner. In the movement, many cadres, especially new cadres, often did not dare to insist on the struggle in order to avoid offending the leaders. Some people put forward opinions, but retreated as soon as they encountered resistance; some adopted the attitude of "protecting themselves wisely" and did not mention them at all; some just sighed behind their backs or irresponsibly conducted "small broadcasts"; and some circled around some trivial matters in life and made an issue of it. For these problems, in addition to emphasizing the need for leading cadres to conduct in-depth self-criticism and express their attitude and determination in a timely manner, it is necessary to give education and criticism in a timely manner, eliminate concerns, and point out that an attitude starting from personal interests is a manifestation of irresponsibility to the country and the people, so that they realize that as a state worker, they have no right to turn a blind eye to bureaucracy in their work, but should carry out an irreconcilable struggle. Only in this way can everyone be mobilized to unanimously launch a struggle against bureaucracy and achieve the expected results of the movement.
    Thirdly, the principle of "combining anti-bureaucracy with construction" must be implemented in the movement, inspecting on the one hand and building on the other. This is the most practical and effective method of encouraging the masses and the quickest way to improve work. It is impossible and unnecessary to separate the two completely. However, the inspection stage and the construction stage must also have their own emphasis, otherwise it is easy to form spontaneity, ignoring one side and causing the movement to take detours. Therefore, the leadership must firmly grasp that in the inspection stage, it is necessary to ensure that the problems are fully exposed, and then shift the focus to construction in a timely manner. Some people mistakenly believe that "once the problems are exposed, bureaucracy will be basically eliminated." This idea must be criticized in a timely manner, otherwise the previous efforts will be in vain.

    天津市的反官僚主义运动
    林青
    天津市自去年十月下旬起，在全市各工厂、企业和市级政权部门、人民群众团体中广泛地开展了反官僚主义运动，取得了很大成绩。
    天津市解放以来，各个单位的工作是有显著成绩的。这些单位，经过了历次的政治运动和一系列的民主改革，基本上已将过去为少数反动统治者服务的官僚机构改造成为人民服务的机构，并建立了不少科学的工作方法和制度，因而取得了今天的成就。但是，由于某些领导干部有着旧思想的残余，入城以后又受到资产阶级的思想影响，内部缺乏健全的民主生活和思想斗争，因而官僚主义作风还很严重。去年八月底，天津市召开第一次党代表会议，通过典型的“杨月辉事件”（杨月辉是天津私营华阳烟草厂的女工，为了检举一个反革命分子，花了一年零三个月的时间，先后奔走了十四个机关，往返达五十九次，最后在“三反”运动中得到正确的处理），对官僚主义进行了揭发和批判。这一典型事件深刻地反映了天津市一部分机关官僚主义的严重性，因而会议一致同意中共天津市委关于开展反对官僚主义的决定。中共天津市委和市人民政府联合组成了反官僚主义办公室，作为统一的领导机构。
    运动进行两个多月，收获很大。运动采取“自上而下的检查与自下而上的批评相结合”的方针与做法，在各级干部自觉参加的基础上，揭发出大量的问题。比如，市地方国营工业局所属的罐头食品厂的厂长魏晨，对工作严重不负责任。厂内既无科学的检验制度，更无科学的产品规格，仅凭“敲打听音”判断罐头的好坏。不能判断的，就列为“蹲品”，丢进仓库，任其腐霉毁坏。因此，自一九五零年二月到去年六月的两年多来，即损坏罐头达二十二万三千多罐，加上去年七月至九月的损坏，共使国家损失达四十九亿元。在“三反”期间，工人曾对上述情况提出意见，但魏晨却置之不理，认为“厂子赚的多，损失点不算啥”。去年七月间，该厂在一天内连续发生摔伤工人二十八名和炸死一名副工程师的严重工伤事故，也是和魏晨的官僚主义作风分不开的。天津市煤业建筑器材公司过去曾以近千吨的煤末填了土坑，另有三万吨煤已有一部分自燃，在这次反官僚主义运动中才被发现。电车公司修一条电车道，事前不勘查，不研究，修了一半，才发现路基不适宜，交通拥挤，只好拆掉。市政工程局在海光寺建筑一座桥，由于领导上不管、设计人员主观臆断，修好后才发现船不能通过。在机关里，拖拉现象和文牍主义作风也相当普遍和严重。市公安局第四分局，积压一年以上没有处理的材料达八百多件。天津市人民政府秘书处发一个文件或通知，在本部门要经过二十四道手续。有一人向房地产管理局申请修缮危险建筑，该局各科互相“照转”，半年没有得到解决。类似事实，不胜枚举。
    这些问题的揭发，使许多干部大吃一惊，对官僚主义的严重危害性有了初步认识。各单位在这一基础上，广泛展开思想批判，通过领导干部的层层检讨和上下相互之间的批评与自我批评，使得认识更趋一致和提高。
    在这一基础上，运动的重点转入了建设工作。这时，一方面对于个别情节严重、拒不悔过的官僚主义分子加以严格处理（如魏晨，行政上撤职、党内取消候补党员的资格），同时，根据检查揭发出来的问题，经过分析研究，找出主要问题，然后发动群众讨论和制订改进办法。首先是加强政治和思想的领导，健全民主生活，充分开展批评与自我批评。过去没有专做政治工作副职的单位，有的已重新分工，使政治工作与业务工作领导，各有专责，又能紧密结合。不少单位并建立与健全了各种政治工作制度，从组织上保障今后民主生活的加强和批评与自我批评的充分开展。为了从根本上克服官僚主义，中共天津市委并做出普遍加强马克思列宁主义理论学习的决定，规定高级干部每周抽出两个半天的时间，集中学习理论。一般干部的理论学习也大大加强了。目前，很多单位已做出了成绩，干部中间的学习空气日益浓厚。其次，在建立与健全各种制度方面，成绩更为显著。比如加强责任制、检查制与监督制等，都有了不少建树。在工厂企业部门，除了某些检查、验收等制度不健全的单位已开始加强以外，劳动保护工作已引起了普遍的重视。市自来水公司为了减少和消灭工伤事故，已健全了安全卫生委员会的机构，并加强了车间的劳保组织。有些工厂并已添置了安全卫生设备，增进了职工的福利。在财经贸易部门，市煤业建筑器材公司除由正、副经理开始逐级建立责任制以外，并决定建立经常性的检查制度。天津市粮食公司为了防止粮食遭受虫害，已拟定了一系列的改进办法，准备逐级建立保管制度，并将建立原始检查、安全检查、虫霉检查等制度。在政府机关单位，正普遍研究如何克服文牍主义的问题，制订新的办法。天津市财经委员会文书科的档案股，自实行新制度以后，工作效率提高了一倍多。过去全股六个人，每天收文八十件左右，现在四个人，每天可处理一百一十多件文件。很多单位接见人民群众与处理人民来信的工作，也都显著加强，积压与拖拉的现象开始得到克服，一般问题均能做到及时处理。
    通过反官僚主义运动，不仅有力地改进了领导，改进了工作，同时也教育了群众，更加密切了党和群众的关系，加强了政府与群众的联系。广大干部在思想上、政治上、工作上普遍提高了一步。许多工厂的领导干部都加强了依靠工人的思想，“重机器不重人”、“只要生产不要安全”的现象已从根本上扭转过来。不少领导干部经常接触下层干部、发现和解决问题。自来水公司在去年六月份曾发生了十二起工伤事故，自反官僚主义以来，已显著减少，十一月份则一件也没有发生。职工的合理化建议日渐增多。军需系统职工在运动中共提了六百六十九条意见，已解决四百零九件。市政工程局制管厂过去废品率达百分之十七，由于职工生产热情进一步提高，现已降到百分之零点九。不少技术人员在运动中也批判了“技术与政治无关”的思想。
    天津市反官僚主义运动中，大部分单位的领导干部均做到了正视自己的错误，以身作则地进行深刻检讨，带动了下层干部层层检讨，群众情绪始终高涨。这是运动开展的关键。但也有少数领导干部如天津市地方国营工业局副局长顾柱、李仲垣等不肯虚心检查自己，抱着“过关”思想，因而消极应付，企图草率结束。下层干部不知道这些领导干部作何打算，因而顾虑很多，迟疑不前，运动的进展非常迟缓。有的领导干部如中国医药公司经理周吉安甚至借口暴露自己的错误“有失领导威信”，变相地压制批评；也有的是居功自傲，对群众的批评置之不理，并且发牢骚，发脾气，如中国医药公司天津市公司经理孟德利等就是如此。对这些现象，市级领导机关及时地进行了严格的批判，明确指出：官僚主义的存在，主要责任在领导干部身上，因而反官僚主义一定要首先反到领导干部的头上。同时强调指出：这次反官僚主义一定要反透、反到底，绝无侥幸之路可走。号召他们积极行动起来，首先以身作则，开展这一斗争。对于居功自傲与消极对抗的人，则坚决地给予严重的打击，以扫清运动的障碍，使这些单位的运动也迅速地健康地开展起来。
    其次，对于下层干部的不健康思想，适时地加以分析和批判，也是十分必要的。在运动中，有不少干部特别是新干部，为了避免得罪领导人，常常不敢坚持斗争。有的虽然提出了意见，但一遭到阻力，便退缩回来；有的则采取“明哲保身”的态度，根本不提；有的只是背后唉声叹气，或不负责地进行“小广播”；也有的在一些生活琐事上打圈子，借题发挥。对于这些问题，除了强调领导干部深刻检讨，及时表明态度和决心以外，必须适时地予以教育批判，消除顾虑，并指出从个人出发的态度是对国家对人民不负责任的表现，使他们认识到：作为一个国家的工作人员，没有权利对工作中的官僚主义熟视无睹，而应该进行不调和的斗争。只有这样，才能把所有的人都发动起来，一致地向官僚主义展开斗争，使运动达到预期的结果。
    再其次，运动中必须实行“边反边建”的方针，一面检查，一面建设，这是最实际、最有效的鼓舞群众的方法，也是改进工作的捷径。把两者截然分开是不可能的，也是不必要的。但是，检查阶段和建设阶段也须各有重点，否则就容易形成自流，忽略了一面，使运动走弯路。因此，领导上要紧紧掌握：检查阶段，一定要保证使问题得到充分的揭发，然后适时地将重点转入建设。曾有人误认为：“把问题揭发出来，官僚主义就基本上反掉了”，这种想法必须及时加以批判，否则就会前功尽弃。
