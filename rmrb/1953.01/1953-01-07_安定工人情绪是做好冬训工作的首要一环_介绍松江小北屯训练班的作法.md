    Stabilizing Workers' Morale is the Primary Task in Ensuring Successful Winter Training
    —Introducing the Practices of the Xiaobeitun Training Class in Songjiang
    The Xiaobeitun Winter Training Class of the Songjiang Provincial Engineering Company is currently training over a thousand construction workers. When the training began, many workers wanted to go home, saying, "It's fine to study, but let me have half a month off first to go home and see my family." Some workers were simply unwilling to study, saying, "Whether we study or not, we still get fed!" Others were unwilling to study politics and only wanted to learn skills, saying, "With skills, we can eat anywhere!" At the same time, inadequate preparation of accommodation and food in the training class also affected the workers' morale.
    In light of this situation, the Winter Training Work Committee of the Engineering Company and the Xiaobeitun Training Class leadership, after studying the situation, concluded that stabilizing the workers' morale and inspiring their enthusiasm for learning were the primary issues at hand. They undertook the following tasks to stabilize the trainees' morale.
    First, strengthen ideological and organizational leadership. Initially, in response to various erroneous ideas, various meetings were convened for education, focusing on using comparisons between the new and old societies to explain that the company had allocated 13 billion yuan to cultivate basic construction workers, whereas in the old society, the exploiting classes treated workers like cattle and horses, and workers had no place to learn even if they wanted to. Why should they not study hard today? The importance of combining political and technical studies was also explained. After the meetings, workers were mobilized to discuss, "Why is the state spending so much money to train us? Would old China have done this?" Many workers painfully recalled being oppressed and exploited in the old society and not having the opportunity to learn. They examined their ideological shortcomings of being uneasy about studying and resolved to study hard. At the same time, leadership of the groups was strengthened to bring into full play the role of the group leaders. The training class carefully studied the Liaoyang Cement Group, which had the best learning morale. The characteristics of this group were: good education at ordinary times, high worker awareness; good leadership from the group leader, who had prestige among the masses, could reflect the situation below, and could understand and implement the intentions of the leadership; a large number of young workers and high interest in learning. Based on the experience of this group, the training class first focused on the work of organizing classes and teams. The one thousand workers were divided into two classes, and each class was further divided into five teams according to their trades. The principles of forming the classes were: to intersperse workers by trade, older and younger workers, different levels of education, skilled workers and apprentices. Each team elected a captain and was assigned an instructor. Then, group leaders were carefully selected, with the criteria being: ideological progress, prestige among the masses, and leadership ability. After the group leaders were selected, they were specifically convened for a meeting to educate them on "How to be a good worker group leader." At the same time, group leader meetings were regularly convened to allow them to reflect the situation, understand the intentions of the leadership, and teach them specific working methods. Because the group leaders were elected by the workers and had close ties with them, the group leaders united the broad masses around them, which played a significant role in stabilizing the trainees' morale.
    After organizing the classes and teams, the leadership announced the political and technical study plans to the masses and mobilized each group to repeatedly discuss them. In the discussions, each individual and each group made pledges and launched competitions. The second group of the fourth team of the first class made a red flag and challenged the entire class, saying: We will never let others take the red flag away. Each group established a "Resolution Platform" and put forward individual pledges. In order to consolidate this enthusiasm, the leadership also arranged for the study of covenants. In order to create a wave of enthusiasm for learning, the Youth League branch specifically convened a meeting of League members to expand the influence through discussion. The workers' enthusiasm for learning greatly increased.
    Second, vigorously carry out political mobilization and improve learning interest through various cultural and entertainment forms. First of all, a collective living system was established, and a bugler was selected to wake up and run or do gymnastics on time every morning. An entertainment evening was held once a week, with crosstalk, storytelling, traditional opera, and clapper talk, all self-written and performed by the workers, to carry out propaganda and education through typical cases. For example, publicize the Communist Party member Shi Xiushu, who is active in learning and patiently helps others; introduce the model deeds of the Liaoyang Cement Group; and at the general meeting, let Wang Yunde, who has advanced ideas, make a typical report. All of these encouraged the trainees' morale. Many workers said: "Collective learning is really good! Just like school!"
    Third, improve the workers' living welfare. The training class established large and small kitchens. The large kitchen costs no more than 50 cents, and the small kitchen no more than 80 cents, which satisfies both skilled workers and apprentices. The administrators and cooks were also organized to study specific ways to significantly improve the food, and the workers' opinions on this matter were reduced. Secondly, workers were mobilized to improve environmental hygiene; the most experienced tilers were found to clean up the stoves and prevent them from smoking; a special person was assigned to burn the stoves to keep the room warm; and a system of serving and eating meals was established to strengthen organizational management. In addition, a clinic was established, and medical personnel were organized to regularly check the workers for illnesses. A life captain (one for every hundred people) was selected from among the workers to be specifically responsible for improving the workers' lives and reflecting the workers' opinions. The responsible cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League in the class headquarters also regularly went deep among the workers to understand their opinions on life and solve them in a timely manner. The workers reflected: "We never had it so good at home! If we don't study hard, how can we be worthy of the state's training!"

    安定工人情绪是做好冬训工作的首要一环
    ——介绍松江小北屯训练班的作法
    松江省工程公司小北屯冬季训练班，正在训练一千余名建筑工人。学习开始时，不少工人要想回家，说：“学习也可以，得先放我半个月的假，回家看看。”也有一部分工人根本就不愿意学习，说：“学也吃饭，不学也吃饭！”还有些人不愿学政治光想学技术，说：“有技术到哪里都能吃饭！”同时由于训练班的住宿、伙食准备得不够好，也影响了工人情绪。
    根据这种情况，工程公司的冬训工作委员会和小北屯训练班班部研究后认为，安定工人情绪，启发工人学习热情是当前的主要问题。他们在安定学员情绪上做了下面几项工作。
    第一，加强思想领导和组织领导。首先，针对各种错误思想，召集各种会议进行教育，着重用新旧对比的方法说明公司为了培养基本建设工人，就拿出一百三十亿元，在旧社会里，剥削阶级把工人当作牛马，工人想学习也没地方学，今天为什么不好好学习呢？同时也说明政治学习和技术学习必须结合的重要意义。会后发动工人讨论“国家为什么拿出这么多的钱培养我们？旧中国会不会这样作？”很多工人痛心地回忆了在旧社会受压迫、受剥削得不到学习机会的往事，检讨了不安心学习的思想毛病，下决心要好好学习。与此同时，也加强了小组领导，发挥小组长的作用。训练班仔细地研究了学习情绪最好的辽阳水泥小组，这个小组的特点是：平时教育好，工人觉悟高；小组长领导的好，在群众中有威信，能反映下面情况，能了解和贯彻领导意图；青年工人较多，学习兴趣高。根据这个小组的经验，训练班首先抓紧了编班编队工作。把一千工人划分了两个班，每班又按工种编成五个队。编班原则是：按工种、老年工与青年工、文化高低、技工与徒工穿插起来，每个队选举一名队长，并派一名辅导员。接着慎重地选择了组长，条件是：思想进步、在群众中有威信、有领导能力。组长选出后，就专门召集会议进行“怎样当好一个工人小组长”的教育，同时经常召集组长会议，让他们反映情况，了解领导意图，并教给他们具体工作方法。因为小组长是工人选出的，和工人有着密切联系，小组长把广大群众团结在自己周围，对安定学员情绪起了很大作用。
    编班编队之后，领导上向群众宣布了政治和技术的学习计划，并发动每一个组反复进行讨论。在讨论中每个人和每个组都订出了保证条件展开竞赛。一班四队二组自己做了红旗向全班提出了挑战，并说：我们决不让别人把红旗拿去；各组都建立了“决心台”，提出个人的保证条件。领导上为了巩固这种热情，又布置了学习公约。为了掀起学习热潮，青年团支部专门召开团员大会，展开讨论扩大影响，工人的学习积极性大大提高。
    第二，大力展开政治鼓动，通过各种文化娱乐形式，提高学习兴趣。首先，建立了集体生活制度，选出了司号员，每天早晨按时起床、跑步或作体操。每周还开一次娱乐晚会，有相声、大鼓、旧剧、快板，都是工人自编自演，通过典型事例进行宣传教育。比如宣传学习积极、能耐心帮助别人的共产党员石秀书；介绍辽阳水泥组的模范事迹；召开大会时，让有先进思想的王云德做典型报告。这些都鼓励了学员情绪。很多工人说：“集体学习真好！和学校一样！”
    第三，改善工人的生活福利，训练班成立了大、小两灶，大灶不超过五十分，小灶不超过八十分，使技工和徒工都满意。还组织管理员、炊事员具体研究，使伙食较前有显著改善，工人在这方面的意见减少了。其次，发动工人搞好环境卫生；找最有经验的瓦匠收拾炉子，不让炉子冒烟；指定专人烧炉子，使屋内经常保持温暖；建立了打饭、吃饭等制度，加强了组织管理。另外还设立了医务所，组织医务人员经常到工人中去检查病；在工人中选出生活队长（每百人一名）专门负责改善工人生活，反映工人意见。班部党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部，也经常深入到工人中去，了解工人对生活方面的意见，并及时解决。工人反映：“在家也没这样过啊！再不好好学习，哪能对得起国家的培养！”    （转载东北日报）
