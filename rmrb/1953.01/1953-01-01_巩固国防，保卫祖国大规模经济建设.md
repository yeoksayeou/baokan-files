    Consolidate National Defense and Defend the Large-Scale Economic Construction of the Motherland
    Jiang Xueshan, Chief of Staff of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, former Commander of the "Tashan Hero Regiment"
    As we welcome the New Year of 1953, I feel both boundless joy and a great sense of responsibility as a commander of the People's Liberation Army. As the people of the whole country enthusiastically throw themselves into the high tide of large-scale economic construction, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, will never be reconciled. They will certainly try every possible conspiracy to undermine our peaceful construction and happy life. The facts today are just like this: U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, is desperately trying to expand its war of aggression on the Korean battlefield, and is ferociously violating our country's airspace, barbarously bombing and strafing our people. This series of sinister measures by the American aggressors to expand their aggressive war seriously threatens our country's construction and the safety of our people. Therefore, it has further strengthened our determination to strive to consolidate national defense and build a regularized and modernized powerful national defense force.
    For more than three years, the People's Liberation Army itself, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, has embarked on a new stage of construction. In particular, the large-scale cultural study movement has improved the cultural level of commanders and fighters throughout the army, laying the foundation for mastering modern advanced military science and technology and for studying Marxism-Leninism. The commanders and fighters of our unit, the "Tashan Hero Regiment," which won the title on the Northeast battlefield during the Liberation War, have not only completed the task of defending the coast since advancing to the coastal defense front, but have also won a great victory on the cultural study front. Soldiers who were illiterate in the past can now not only read books, newspapers, and military books, but also write articles of seven or eight hundred words with rich content and vivid sentences. On the study front, as in the past wars, a large number of meritorious models have emerged, giving the heroic troops an unprecedented new look.
    In welcoming the New Year of 1953, especially in welcoming the new historical period when the motherland begins to enter large-scale economic construction, I will certainly work and study a hundred times harder, lead the troops well, strengthen political, cultural, and military training, consolidate coastal defense, heighten vigilance, and be ready to strike at aggressors who dare to invade our country, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the economic construction of the people of the motherland. I am willing to make this determination as a gift to the people of the motherland in welcoming the New Year of 1953!

    巩固国防，保卫祖国大规模经济建设
    中国人民解放军第四野战军某部参谋长  原“塔山英雄团”团长江雪山
    在迎接一九五三年新年的时候，我一方面感到无限的喜悦，又一方面感到作为一个人民解放军的指挥员的责任的重大。当全国人民热烈投入大规模经济建设高潮中时，美帝国主义及其豢养下的走狗蒋介石残余匪帮绝不会甘心，它们一定想尽各种阴谋来破坏我们的和平建设和幸福生活。今天的事实也正是这样：美帝国主义仍在霸占着我国领土台湾，在朝鲜战场上极力企图扩大侵略战争，并穷凶极恶地侵犯我国领空，野蛮地轰炸、扫射我国人民。美国侵略者这一系列阴谋扩大侵略战争的罪恶措施，严重地威胁到我国的建设和人民的安全，因此，也就更使我们增强了进一步为巩固国防、建设正规化现代化强大国防军而奋斗的决心。
    三年多来，人民解放军本身也在党和毛主席的领导下，走上了一个新的建设阶段。尤其是大规模的文化学习运动，提高了全军指挥员、战斗员的文化水平，为掌握现代化的先进军事科学和技术，为学习马克思列宁主义奠定了基础。我部曾在解放东北战场上获得“塔山英雄团”称号的全团指挥员、战斗员，自进军到海防前线以来，不但完成了守卫海防的任务，在文化学习战线上也打了大胜仗。过去一字不识的战士们，现在不仅能看书、报和军事书籍，还能写出内容充实、词句生动的七八百字的文章来。在学习战线上，像在过去的战争中一样，也涌现出来大批功臣模范，使英雄的部队出现了空前未有的新气象。
    在迎接一九五三年新年时，尤其是迎接祖国开始进入大规模经济建设这一新的历史时期，我一定百倍地努力工作和学习，带好部队，加强政治、文化和军事训练，巩固海防，提高警惕，随时准备打击敢于侵犯我国的侵略者，保卫祖国人民的经济建设得以顺利进行，我愿意把这个决心，做为迎接一九五三年新年时向祖国人民的献礼！
