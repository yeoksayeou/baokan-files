    The Great Power of the Socialist Basic Economic Law in Action
    Ma Peiwen
    In the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin explicitly pointed out: "The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism can be roughly formulated as follows: to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society through the continuous growth and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher technology." The communiqué of the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on the results of the implementation of the national economic development plan for 1952 vividly demonstrates the great power of this law in action.
    Further Upsurge in Industrial and Agricultural Production
    The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1952 has been overfulfilled according to the plan. In particular, heavy industries such as metallurgy, electricity, and fuel have exceeded the plan: steel completed 103, electricity completed 102, automobiles and tractors completed 102, power stations completed 100.9, oil completed 100.7, and coal completed 100.2 (with the 1952 planned figures as 100). According to the provisions of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan, the annual increase rate of the production of means of production is 13 percent. In reality, in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan, the production of means of production has increased by an average of 15 percent annually. Comrade Stalin, when discussing the three basic prerequisites for the transition from socialism to communism, particularly emphasized the importance of giving priority to the growth of the production of means of production. Because giving priority to the growth of the production of means of production can guarantee the equipment needed by all sectors of the national economy and enterprises to continuously carry out expanded reproduction. In the development process of the Soviet national economy, the priority given to the production of means of production can be clearly seen. Malenkov pointed out at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that if the total industrial output in 1940 was 100, then by 1952 the total industrial output would rise to 223, equivalent to 2.3 times that of 1940. The growth of the production of means of production was even more rapid. If the production of means of production in 1940 was 100, then by 1952 it would rise to 267, equivalent to 2.7 times that of 1940. Several of the Soviet Union's most important industries have developed particularly rapidly in recent years. In 1952, the Soviet Union's annual output of pig iron will reach 25 million tons, steel output will reach 35 million tons, coal output will reach 300 million tons, oil output will reach 47 million tons, and electricity output will reach 117 billion kilowatt-hours. In reality, now the plan is executed and the total industrial output is overfulfilled. That is to say, in the four years since 1949, the Soviet Union's pig iron production will increase by 11 million tons, steel will increase by 17 million tons, coal will increase by 96 million tons, oil will increase by 17 million tons, and electricity will increase by 52 billion kilowatt-hours. Due to the rapid growth of the production of means of production, the production of consumer goods, which aims to improve the material and cultural needs of the entire people, is also constantly growing. In 1952, the total output of Soviet consumer goods industry increased by another 17 percent compared with 1951, greatly exceeding the target of an average annual increase of 11 percent stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and increased by 60 percent compared with 1940 before the war. The Soviet people have therefore obtained a more sufficient supply of consumer goods in material and cultural aspects year by year.
    In order to ensure the supply of raw materials for the country's industry and meet the food needs of the entire people, Soviet socialist agriculture has undergone new development in 1952. At the beginning of 1950, there were more than 254,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union, a large part of which were smaller collective farms. After the merger of the collective farms, by 1952 the Soviet Union possessed 97,000 collective farms of relatively large scale. This has created more favorable conditions for the further mechanization of agricultural production and the further increase in grain output. In 1952, the sown area of ​​crops was expanded by another 2,765,000 hectares, and the total grain output reached 8 billion poods, while in 1951 the total grain output was only 7.4 billion poods. This is a very significant achievement in Soviet agricultural production.
    Further Automation and Mechanization in Industrial and Agricultural Production
    The development of the Soviet national economy mainly relies on improving labor productivity. For example, from 1940 to 1951, industrial labor productivity increased by 50 percent, and 70 percent of the increased industrial output during this period was the result of increased labor productivity. In order to improve labor productivity, the Soviet Union widely used new machines and adopted advanced technical operating methods to mechanize and automate the production process. The superior socialist system of the Soviet Union has opened up unlimited possibilities for the adoption of new inventions and creations in production to further mechanize and automate production. In 1952, there were new achievements in the application of new machines and advanced operating technologies. In 1952, the Soviet machine manufacturing industry invented 600 major new machines and equipment, which is 100 more than the major machines and equipment invented in 1951.
    While using new machines and equipment, high-efficiency technical operation processes and production automation processes were also developed in 1952. The comprehensive automation of the production process is a significant feature of communist society in terms of production technology. In 1952, all hydropower stations that had generated electricity in the Soviet power station department system had adopted automatic operation methods. Among them, remote control operation methods that could further improve production efficiency and save labor had reached 50 percent of the total power generation capacity of hydropower stations.
    Due to the increase in the degree of mechanization and automation in industrial production, the production efficiency of Soviet industrial workers has increased by another 7 percent, more than 60 percent higher than in 1940. At the same time, the further mechanization of agricultural production has also been guaranteed. In 1952, another 131,000 tractors, 41,000 grain harvesting combines, 57,000 trucks, and more than 2 million other agricultural machines were transported from Soviet cities and factories to rural areas. In 1952, machine tractor stations completed 75 percent of the main field work of collective farms. In 1951, the area of ​​grain harvested by collective farms using grain harvesting combines accounted for 60 percent of the total grain planting area, while in 1952 70 percent of the total grain planting area of ​​collective farms had been harvested by combine harvesters. In 1952, the work of sowing cotton, sugar beets, and other industrial crops was almost completely mechanized.
    Communist society wants to turn labor from a burden into "the first need of life" (Marx) and to turn "labor from a heavy burden into pleasure" (Engels). The rapid development of automation and mechanization in Soviet industrial and agricultural production is a clear sign of moving towards communist society.
    Improvement of the Material and Cultural Living Standards of the Entire People
    The tremendous achievements of the Soviet national economy in 1952 have further greatly improved the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. In 1952, the Soviet Union's national income increased by 11 percent compared with 1951, more than doubling the level before the war in 1940. All the national income of the Soviet Union belongs to the entire working people. Among them, a quarter is controlled by the state, collective farms, and cooperatives in order to expand socialist production and create more wealth for the entire people. The remaining three-quarters are entirely used to meet the individual material and cultural needs of the entire people. Therefore, in 1952, the income of each employee in the Soviet Union increased by another 7 percent compared with 1951, and the income of each farmer increased by another 8 percent.
    The increase in the number of schools at all levels in the Soviet Union shows the continued upsurge in the cultural life of the Soviet people. In 1952, the number of students in grades 5 to 10 increased by more than 1.5 million compared with 1951, of which the number of students in grades 8 to 10 increased by 1 million. This is the result of the transition from universal seven-year education to universal secondary education in major cities and industrial centers across the country. According to the provisions of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, by the end of 1955, "the capital cities of all republics, cities directly under the republics, central cities of provinces and border regions, and large industrial centers should completely change seven-year education to universal secondary education (ten-year education). Prepare conditions for fully implementing universal secondary education (ten-year education) in other cities and rural areas during the next five-year plan." Implementing higher education and comprehensive technical education for the entire people is a necessary condition for the transition from socialism to communism.
    The victorious completion of the second year's tasks of the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan is a great achievement of the Soviet people under the leadership of the great Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in correctly applying the basic economic law of socialism to benefit society and the entire people, and a concrete proof of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Now, the Soviet people are advancing towards communist society along this path, and are pointing out a bright and happy path for all mankind.

    社会主义基本经济法则发生作用的伟大力量
    马沛文
    在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中，斯大林同志曾明确指出：“社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，可以大致表述如下：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”苏联部长会议中央统计局发表的一九五二年发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报，生动地显示了这个法则发生作用的伟大力量。
    工农业生产的进一步高涨
    苏联一九五二年的工业总产量已按照计划超额完成了。特别是冶金、电力、燃料等重工业都已超过计划：钢铁完成了一○三，电气完成了一○二，汽车与拖拉机完成了一○二，电力站完成了一○○点九，石油完成了一○○点七，煤完成了一○○点二（以一九五二年计划数字为一○○）。按照苏联第五个五年计划的规定，每年生产资料产量的增加率是百分之十三，实际上五年计划的头两年生产资料的生产平均每年已增长了百分之十五。斯大林同志在论述从社会主义过渡到共产主义的三个基本先决条件时，特别强调指出生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位的重要性。因为生产资料生产的增长占优先地位，就可保证国民经济一切部门企业所需要的装备，以不断进行扩大再生产。在苏联国民经济的发展过程中，可以明显地看出生产资料生产所占的优先地位。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上曾指出，如果一九四○年工业总产量为一○○，则到一九五二年工业总产量将上升到二二三，相当于一九四○年的二点三倍，生产资料的生产的增长更为迅速，如以一九四○年生产资料的生产为一○○，到一九五二年就要上升到二六七了，相当于一九四○年的二点七倍；苏联几种最重要的工业近几年有特别迅速的发展，一九五二年，苏联铣铁的年产量将达二千五百万吨，钢产量将达三千五百万吨，煤产量将达三万万吨，石油产量将达四千七百万吨，电力产量将达一千一百七十亿瓩时。实际上现在计划执行的结果，工业总产量是超额完成了。这就是说，从一九四九年起的四年中间，苏联的铣铁产量要增加一千一百万吨，钢要增加一千七百万吨，煤要增加九千六百万吨，石油要增加一千七百万吨，电力要增加五百二十亿瓩时。由于生产资料生产的迅速增长，使目的在于提高全体人民物质和文化需要的消费品的生产也在不断增长中。一九五二年苏联消费品工业的总产量比一九五一年又增加了百分之十七，大大超过第五个五年计划规定的每年平均增加百分之十一的指标，比战前的一九四○年则增加了百分之六十。苏联人民已因此一年比一年获得了更充足的物质和文化方面的消费品的供应。
    为了保证对国家工业原料的供应和满足全体人民食物的需要，苏联社会主义的农业在一九五二年又有新的发展。一九五○年年初苏联有二十五万四千个以上的集体农庄，其中有很大一部分是规模较小的集体农庄，经过集体农庄的合并以后，到一九五二年苏联拥有的是九万七千个规模比较巨大的集体农庄了。这就给农业生产的进一步机械化和谷物产量的进一步提高创造了更有利的条件。一九五二年农作物的播种面积又扩大了二百七十六万五千公顷，谷物总产量则达到八十亿普特，而在一九五一年谷物的总产量还只七十四亿普特。这是苏联农业生产上的一个非常重大的成就。
    工农业生产中的进一步自动化和机械化
    苏联国民经济的发展，主要是提高劳动生产率。如从一九四○年到一九五一年，工业劳动生产率提高了百分之五十，而这一时期增加的工业产量就有百分之七十是由于劳动生产率提高的结果。为了提高劳动生产率，苏联广泛地使用了新的机器和采用了先进的技术操作方法，使生产过程机械化和自动化。苏联优越的社会主义制度，为在生产上采用新的发明和创造，使生产进一步机械化和自动化开辟了无限的可能性。一九五二年在应用新的机器和先进的操作技术方面又有新的成就。一九五二年苏联机器制造业发明了六百种主要的新的机器和设备，这比一九五一年发明的主要机器和设备还多了
    一百种。
    在使用新式机器和装备的同时，一九五二年还发展了高效率的技术操作过程和生产自动化的过程。生产过程的全面自动化，是共产主义社会在生产技术方面的显著特点。一九五二年苏联电站部系统中已经发电的一切水电站，都已采用了自动操作法，其中能够进一步提高生产效率并节省劳动力的远距离操纵作业法，已达水电站总发电能力的百分之五十。
    由于工业生产中机械化和自动化程度的提高，使苏联产业工人的生产效率又提高了百分之七，比一九四○年则提高了百分之六十以上，同时农业生产的进一步机械化也因此而得到了保证。在一九五二年，又有十三万一千部拖拉机，四万一千部谷物收割联合机，五万七千部卡车以及二百多万部其他农业机器从苏联的各个城市和工厂运入农村。一九五二年机器拖拉机站完成了集体农庄主要田间工作的百分之七十五。一九五一年集体农庄用谷物收割联合机收割的谷物面积占全部谷物种植面积的百分之六十，而一九五二年集体农庄全部谷物种植面积的百分之七十已经用联合收割机收割了。一九五二年播种棉花甜菜以及其他工业作物的工作差不多已经全部机械化。
    共产主义社会要把劳动从累赘变成“生活的第
    一需要”（马克思），要把“劳动从沉重的负担变成愉快”（恩格斯）。苏联在工农业生产中自动化和机械化的飞快发展，就是向着共产主义社会迈进的显明标志。
    全体人民物质和文化生活水平的提高
    苏联一九五二年国民经济发展的巨大成就，使苏联人民的物质生活和文化生活水平进一步大大提高。一九五二年苏联的国民收入比一九五一年增加了百分之十一，比战前的一九四○年增加了一倍以上。苏联的全部国民收入是属于全体劳动人民的，其中除四分之一由国家、集体农庄和合作社支配，以便扩大社会主义生产为全体人民创造更多的财富外，其余约四分之三完全用来满足全体人民的个人物质生活和文化生活需要。因此，一九五二年苏联每一个职工的收入比一九五一年又增加了百分之七，每一个农民的收入则又增加了百分之八。
    苏联各级学校人数的增加，表示了苏联人民文化生活的继续高涨。一九五二年五年级到十年级的学生比一九五一年增加了一百五十多万，其中八年级到十年级的学生人数即增加了一百万。这是由于全国各大城市和工业中心实行由普及七年制的教育过渡到普及中等教育的结果。按照第五个五年计划的规定，到一九五五年年底要把“各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、省和边疆区的中心城市以及大工业中心，把七年制教育完全改为普及中等教育（十年制教育）。为下一个五年计划期间在其他城市和农村中完全实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）准备条件。”对全体人民实施更高级的教育以及多样技术的综合教育，是从社会主义过渡到共产主义的一个必要条件。
    苏联新五年计划第二年任务的胜利完成，是苏联人民在伟大的斯大林和苏联共产党的领导下正确运用社会主义基本经济法则造福社会造福全体人民的伟大成就，是社会主义制度比资本主义制度具有无比优越性的具体证明。现在，苏联人民正在沿着这条道路向着共产主义社会迈进，并给全人类指出了一条光明幸福的道路。
