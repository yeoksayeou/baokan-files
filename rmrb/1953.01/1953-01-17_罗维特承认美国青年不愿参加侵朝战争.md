    Lovett Admits American Youth Reluctant to Participate in War of Aggression Against Korea
    Recently, American newspapers have been constantly leaking news about the increasing number of deserters in the American army. On January 13, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett gave a speech at a press conference on this matter. Although he tried his best to argue that he "does not think the number is alarming," he unintentionally admitted an important fact. Lovett said that the reason for the large number of deserters is that many young people simply do not want to go to Korea to fight.
    This is undoubtedly one of the huge obstacles in the way of the American ruling group's attempt to dominate the world.

    罗维特承认美国青年不愿参加侵朝战争
    最近美国报纸不断泄露出美国军队中逃兵增多的消息。一月十三日，美国国防部部长罗维特为此在记者招待会上发表谈话，虽然他仍竭力辩称他“不认为数目很惊人”，但却在无意中承认了一个重要的事实。罗维特说：逃兵数目所以很多，是因为许多青年根本不愿意到朝鲜去作战。
    这无疑是摆在美国统治集团妄图独霸世界的道路上的巨大障碍之一。
