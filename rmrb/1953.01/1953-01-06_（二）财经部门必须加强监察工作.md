    (II) Financial and Economic Departments Must Strengthen Supervisory Work
    At the start of our country's large-scale economic construction, strengthening the supervisory work of financial and economic departments is of particular importance. This is not only because we must discover and overcome various errors and shortcomings in our work at any time if we want to ensure the smooth completion of the economic construction plan, but also because, within our state organs and enterprises, passive怠工, acting contrary to orders, corruption and waste, bureaucratism, coercive orders, and suppression of criticism are still quite common and quite serious. Therefore, we must vigorously strengthen mass supervision and inspection work to discover and correct all deviations and errors in a timely manner.
    The "Provisional Organizational Regulations for Supervision Offices of Financial and Economic Organs and State-Owned Financial and Economic Enterprises at or above the Provincial (Municipal) Level" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government is very important for improving the supervisory work of financial and economic departments. The establishment of supervision offices in financial and economic organs and enterprises will subject the staff of these organs and departments to more rigorous and regular supervision and inspection, enabling all organs and personnel who resolutely struggle against bad tendencies, have outstanding work achievements, or have made meritorious contributions to rescue accidents to receive regular encouragement and support, greatly reducing or even eliminating all phenomena of passive怠工, acting contrary to orders, corruption and waste, and bureaucratic practices, and ensuring the forceful implementation of the state's policies, laws, decrees, guidelines, plans, resolutions, and orders.
    Since this work is still new to us, many organs and units may not have a sufficient understanding of it, which requires careful attention. In the past, except for a few systems that were equipped with relatively appropriate cadres to carry out this work and have achieved certain results, most units only assigned one or two cadres, or still doubt whether it is necessary to establish a supervision office. Some supervision office staff themselves cannot actively carry out their work because of their low level, unfamiliarity with the business, or the leadership comrades of the unit not paying enough attention; and when encountering difficulties and certain resistance and not being able to get timely help and support from the leadership comrades, the work becomes even more passive. To change this situation, on the one hand, supervisory committees at all levels must urge all systems and units to earnestly equip cadres in accordance with the prescribed quantity and quality, and on the other hand, they must conduct necessary education for the cadres of the supervision office to improve their understanding of this work, guide them to actively learn, create, and accumulate experience in their work.
    It is difficult to avoid encountering resistance from some cadres with impure ideology and style when the supervision office is establishing and developing its work. Therefore, the leaders of the unit, the higher-level supervision office, and even the supervisory committees at all levels must provide necessary help and support to enable the lower-level supervisors to overcome difficulties and carry out their work. At the same time, it should also educate and help the supervisory staff to carry forward the revolutionary fighting spirit, adhere to the truth, and fight to the end against erroneous tendencies, and never be overwhelmed by difficulties. They should be told that as long as they can adhere to the struggle in accordance with policy principles, they will surely get the support of the Party and the masses, and they will surely win.
    When carrying out their work, supervision office personnel should, on the one hand, conduct serious and earnest inspection and handling of errors, deviations, and accidents that have already occurred; on the other hand, they must pay attention to regular inspection and supervision so that possible errors, deviations, and accidents can be prevented in a timely manner. That is to say, supervision office personnel should never passively sit back and watch errors occur, but should actively and proactively pay attention to business work in all aspects, observe and study what problems are budding, what errors may occur, and promptly submit suggestions to leaders and supervisory organs to improve work and prevent errors, and directly participate in the improvement of work. Only in this way can the supervisory work play a greater role.
    For the supervision office to carry out the above work smoothly, it cannot rely solely on a few professional supervisors, but must be good at organizing and mobilizing the vast number of cadres and the masses to participate together. That is to say, it must give play to the political enthusiasm and the high sense of responsibility for the cause of national construction of the vast number of supervision correspondents and all cadres and the masses, so that everyone will act to promote national economic construction and report and expose all violations of laws and dereliction of duty and errors and shortcomings in the work at any time and any place. Therefore, setting up people's opinion boxes or people's reporting reception rooms and trying to strengthen their role has become a task that the supervision office should pay close attention to. The supervision office should conduct publicity and explanation to the vast number of cadres and the masses, call on everyone to support the work of the supervision office, and jointly conduct a resolute struggle against all bad phenomena.

    （二）财经部门必须加强监察工作
    在我国大规模经济建设开始的时候，健全财经部门的监察工作有着特别重要的意义。这不但是因为我们要想保证经济建设计划的顺利完成，就必须随时发现与克服工作中的各种错误和缺点，而且因为在我们国家机关和企业部门中，消极怠工、阳奉阴违、贪污浪费、官僚主义、强迫命令和压制批评等违法乱纪的行为，还相当普遍和相当严重。因此，我们必须大力加强群众性的监督与检查的工作，以便及时地发现与纠正一切偏向与错误。
    中央人民政府政务院颁发省（市）以上各级人民政府财经机关与国营财经企业部门监察室暂行组织通则，对于健全财经部门的监察工作，是十分重要的。监察室在财经机关与财经企业部门的设立，将使这些机关、部门的工作人员受到更加严格与经常的监督与检查，使所有对不良倾向作坚决斗争、工作成绩卓著或挽救事故有功的机关和人员得到经常的鼓励与支持，大大地减少以至消灭一切消极怠工、阳奉阴违、贪污浪费和官僚主义等违法失职现象，使国家的政策、法律、法令、方针、计划、决议与命令的贯彻执行获得有力的保证。
    由于这一工作对于我们还是新的工作，许多机关与单位可能对这一工作还认识不足，这是十分需要注意的。过去除个别系统配备了比较适当的干部进行这一工作，并已取得一定成绩以外，大多数单位只配备了一两个干部，或者至今还在怀疑成立监察室是否有必要。监察室工作人员本身，也有的因为水准不高、业务生疏或该单位领导同志不够重视而不能积极主动地进行工作；而在遇到困难和某些抵抗而不能及时得到领导同志的帮助与支持时，工作就更加被动。要改变这种情形，必须一方面由各级监委督促各系统各单位认真按照规定的数量和质量配备干部，另一方面必须对监察室干部进行必要的教育，提高他们对这一工作的认识，领导他们积极地在工作中学习，创造和积累经验。
    监察室在建立与开展自己的工作时，遭遇一部分思想作风不纯的干部的抵抗是很难避免的。因此，本单位的领导者、上级监察室以至各级监察委员会必须予以必要的帮助与支持，使下级监察人员能够克服困难，开展工作。同时也应该教育和帮助监察工作人员发扬革命的战斗精神，坚持真理，与错误倾向斗争到底，决不要被困难所压倒。应该告诉他们：只要自己能按照政策原则坚持斗争，就一定会得到党和群众的支持，就一定会取得胜利。
    监察室人员在进行工作的时候，一方面应该对已经发生了的错误、偏向与事故，进行严肃认真的检查与处理；另一方面又必须注意平时的检查与监督，使可能发生的错误、偏向与事故得到及时的防止。这就是说，监察室人员决不应该消极被动地坐视错误的发生，而应该积极主动地去经常注意各方面的业务工作，观察与研究什么问题正在萌芽，有可能发生什么错误，及时地向领导者和监察机关提出改进工作、防止错误的建议，并直接参加对工作的改进。只有这样，才能使监察工作发挥更大的作用。
    监察室要顺利进行以上工作，就不能单凭几个专业的监察人员，而必须善于组织和发动广大干部、群众共同来进行。这就是说，它必须发挥广大监察通讯员和所有的干部、群众的政治积极性及对国家建设事业的高度责任感，使大家都为推进国家经济建设而行动起来，随时随地检举、揭发各种违法失职现象和工作中的错误、缺点。因此，设置人民意见箱或人民检举接待室，并设法加强其作用，就成为监察室应该很好注意的工作。监察室应该向广大干部、群众进行宣传解释，号召大家支持监察室的工作，共同对一切不良现象进行坚决的斗争。
