    Churchill Leaves the United States
    (Xinhua News Agency) British Prime Minister Churchill, who arrived in New York on the 5th, left the United States on the 9th for a vacation in Jamaica. During his stay in the United States, Churchill held three talks with incoming U.S. President Eisenhower, and held meetings with Dulles, the incoming Secretary of State of the Republican government, and Aldrich, the incoming Ambassador to Britain, to exchange views on the international situation and the aggressive policies of the U.S.-British bloc, especially aggressive steps in the Far East, and U.S.-British relations. After his talks with Eisenhower, Churchill went to Washington to pay a "courtesy visit" to Truman. According to reports from Washington newspapers, Churchill's special visit to the United States, apart from receiving a "polite" reception from Eisenhower, failed to obtain any "guarantees" from Eisenhower that would be favorable to Britain.

    邱吉尔离开了美国
    据新华社讯：五日抵达纽约的英国首相邱吉尔，已在九日离美赴牙买加度假期。在逗留美国期间，邱吉尔曾和即将上任的美国总统艾森豪威尔举行了三次会谈，并和即将就任共和党政府国务卿的杜勒斯以及即将任驻英大使的阿尔德里治举行了会议，就国际形势和美英集团侵略政策、特别是在远东方面的侵略步骤以及美英的关系等问题交换意见。邱吉尔在和艾森豪威尔会谈后曾往华盛顿向杜鲁门作“礼节上的访问”。据华盛顿各报报道，邱吉尔这次专诚访美除了受到艾森豪威尔的“客气的”接待外，并未能从艾森豪威尔方面获得有利于英国的“保证”。
