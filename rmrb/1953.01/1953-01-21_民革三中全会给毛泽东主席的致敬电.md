Respected Chairman Mao:

    As you call upon the people of the whole country to carry out the three great tasks of the nation, we—the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang—are being held in Beijing. We would like to express our highest respect to you on behalf of all members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang!

    Our meeting summarized past work experiences and focused on discussing how to meet the three major political tasks of the country. A unanimous resolution was passed: calling on all comrades to actively strive to continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, carry out large-scale national construction, and convene the National People's Congress and people's congresses at all levels. It also requires all comrades to strengthen work, strengthen learning, and strengthen organization to meet the three great tasks of the country.

    Our meeting unanimously cheered for the great achievements of the new China in the past three years! Unanimously cheered for the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting U.S. aggressors! Unanimously cheered for the consolidation and development of the strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union! Unanimously cheered for the growth of the peace and democracy camp and the upsurge of the world people's peace movement! Calling on all comrades to devote themselves to the great struggle of building the motherland and defending peace with practical actions!

    Our meeting is scheduled to close today. With excitement and gratitude, we respectfully wish you eternal health!

        The Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
