Some Units in East China Have Not Seriously Adjusted Technical Personnel
Some Enterprises in Zhejiang Actually Refuse to Execute Orders to Transfer Cadres and Technical Personnel

　　To date, more than 1,400 mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering specialists in East China are being unreasonably retained in personnel, labor unions, secretarial, or general administrative and other non-technical positions. The most typical examples include Zheng Dingneng, a graduate of the Civil Engineering Department of Jiaotong University, who manages "antiques" at the Cultural Relics Management Committee of the East China Culture Department, and Feng Zimin, a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University with more than ten years of practical work experience, who works on eliminating illiteracy at the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee instructed local party committees in June of last year to conduct registration and deployment of technical cadres. To date, more than 5,000 technical cadres who are not using their skills have been registered in various regions. Approximately 70 percent have been initially adjusted, but a large number of cadres have not been transferred. During the registration of technical cadres, it was discovered that many departments have severely buried and wasted technical personnel. Leaders in many units emphasize the needs of their own units, stressing that "doing anything is serving the people," which prevents many technical personnel from better utilizing their talents. More seriously, they "lay an ambush" during the registration of technical cadres, preventing them from registering. For example, in the departments under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, more than 20 electrical and civil engineering specialists are working as primary school teachers and accountants, and the leading cadres of the Education Bureau are still not allowing them to register. Many units, after registering technical cadres, propose internal adjustments for those with good skills and are unwilling to transfer them out. For those with weaker skills, or who are old, weak, or disabled, they claim that "internal adjustment is difficult" and request the personnel department to transfer them out immediately. For example, the former Sounan Administrative Office's Industry Department assigned some engineering school graduates to general statistical work, refusing to transfer them out, saying that they had already "matched their studies with their work." They took a universally negative attitude towards those who had generally low technical skills, superficial knowledge, or no technical knowledge, were restless in their original units, or were old and sick, complaining to the personnel department, "Why don't you let their technical skills return to their team!"

　　In recent days, the Shanghai Liberation Daily has severely criticized leading personnel who have committed departmentalism errors in national construction. In a short commentary, "Resolutely Oppose Departmentalism," the Liberation Daily reminded those with departmentalist tendencies: "The Central Committee has repeatedly instructed that in order to complete the task of large-scale economic construction in the motherland, and in order to strengthen the planning nature of production, it is necessary to strengthen the unified and centralized leadership of the Central Committee; it has repeatedly pointed out that departmentalism and localism, which disregard the overall situation, are stumbling blocks to construction and must be resolutely overcome. Why do the responsible persons of these departments turn a deaf ear to these instructions? Do they think that these instructions from the Central Committee and higher authorities are just talk and do not need to be implemented in action? Do they think that they are responsible cadres and are not bound by these instructions?"

　　The commentary pointed out that wasting talent is more serious than wasting any of the country's wealth, and demanded that all agencies, organizations, and enterprises consciously obey the overall interests and the allocation of higher authorities, and resolutely eliminate thoughts and behaviors that violate the above spirit in practical actions.

　　Driven by departmentalism, leading personnel in some enterprise departments in Zhejiang Province are not executing orders to transfer cadres and technical personnel to strengthen the basic construction departments, which has greatly affected the design and construction tasks of the province's Construction Engineering Bureau in the first and second quarters of this year. In mid-December of last year, the Personnel Department of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the Organization Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC discussed the work of allocating cadres and technical personnel to strengthen the basic construction departments based on this year's basic construction tasks, and determined the list of cadres to be transferred. Subsequently, orders were issued to relevant departments to transfer them. To date, many units have delayed and refused to transfer them with various excuses. For example, it was determined to transfer a manager from the Coal Industry Building Materials Company under the Commerce Department, a planning section chief from the Department Store Company, and a secretarial section chief from the Native Produce Company to the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau. Two orders were issued successively, but these companies not only delayed the transfer but also emphasized the importance of their own business and applied for exemption. Although they verbally agreed later, they have not been transferred to this day. The Personnel Section of the Zhejiang Branch of the People's Bank of China has one section chief and two deputy section chiefs. The Provincial People's Government Personnel Department decided to transfer one deputy section chief to the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau. Two orders were issued on January 2nd and 6th, but he has not been transferred. More seriously, some units are retaining a large number of technical personnel and are unwilling to release them. For example, the Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau does not have any major basic construction tasks this year, but it retains 17 civil engineering technicians (including four engineers). The Provincial Department of Industry issued an order at the end of last month to transfer them to the technical design departments of the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau for centralized use, but the bureau has not released a single person to this day. Because many departments, driven by departmentalism, do not take care of the overall situation and resist orders to transfer technical personnel and cadres, the timely completion of the design and construction department plans for this year's basic construction has been affected. The design and construction tasks undertaken by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau this year account for more than 60 percent of the province's basic construction tasks. However, the bureau's technical design office is still short of more than half of its staff, and the newly established construction section does not have a single person. The planning section, which needs six or seven engineers, has only one engineer. Based on the current situation, the bureau will only be able to complete about one-third of its design tasks for the first quarter, and many projects that are scheduled to start construction in the second quarter will become problematic. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Personnel Department of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government have inspected these situations and will resolutely overcome the departmentalist thinking of the leaders of these departments and implement the orders for transferring personnel to quickly complete the preparatory work for basic construction.

### 华东有些单位还没有认真调整技术人材  浙江某些企业部门竟不执行抽调干部和技术人员的命令

    华东有些单位还没有认真调整技术人材
    浙江某些企业部门竟不执行抽调干部和技术人员的命令
    华东各地到现在还有一千四百多个机械、电机、土木工程专门人材被不合理地留在人事、工会、秘书或一般行政等非技术工作岗位上。其中最典型的如交通大学土木系毕业的郑定能，在华东文化部文物管理委员会管理“古董”，交通大学电机系毕业并有十多年实际工作经验的冯子敏在南京市总工会做扫除文盲工作。
    中共中央华东局在去年六月指示各地党委进行技术干部登记调配工作。到目前为止，各地已登记的用非所学的技术干部已有五千多个，其中已作初步调整的占百分之七十，还有大批干部没有调出。在技术干部登记工作中发现：许多部门埋没和浪费技术人材的现象相当严重。许多单位的领导方面强调自己本单位的需要，强调“做什么都是为人民服务”，使许多技术人材不能更好地发挥他们的才能；更严重的是在技术干部登记中“打埋伏”，不让登记。如上海市人民政府教育局所属部门中有二十多个电机、土木专门人材在做小学教员和会计，而教育局的领导干部现在还不让他们进行登记。也有许多单位在办理技术干部登记后，对于技术好的就提出由本单位内部自行调整，而不愿调出；对于技术较差的或老弱残废的就说“本单位不易调整”，要求人事部门立即调出。如前苏南行署工业处把一些工程专科学校毕业的人员调做一般统计工作，不肯外调，说：已“学用一致”了；而对一般技术不高、一知半解、或不懂技术的、不安心原单位工作而闹情绪的，和年老多病的就一律采取向外推的态度，并埋怨人事处说：“为什么不使他们技术归队呀！”
    连日来，上海解放日报对在国家建设中犯了本位主义错误的领导人员进行了严厉的批评，解放日报在“坚决反对本位主义”的短评中这样提醒那些具有本位主义的领导人员说：“中央一再指示：为了完成祖国大规模经济建设任务，为了加强生产的计划性，必须加强中央统一和集中的领导；一再指出：那种不顾大局的本位主义与地方主义，是阻碍建设的绊脚石，必须坚决克服。为什么这些部门的负责人对这些指示竟置若罔闻呢？难道他们认为中央及上级的这些指示，只是说说而已、用不着在行动上加以贯彻吗？难道他们以为他们是负责干部，可以不受这些指示的约束吗？”
    短评指出浪费人材比浪费国家的任何财富都严重得多，要求各个机关、团体、企业自觉地服从整体利益，服从上级调配，在实际行动中坚决肃清违反上述精神的思想和行为。　（新华社）
    浙江省某些企业部门领导人员从本位主义出发，不执行抽调干部和技术人员充实到基本建设部门中去的命令，已使该省建筑工程管理局今年第一、第二季度的设计和施工任务受到很大影响。去年十二月中旬，浙江省人民政府人事厅和中共浙江省委员会组织部根据今年基本建设的任务，讨论了调配干部和技术人员充实到基本建设部门中去的工作，并且已确定了需要抽调干部的名单，接着就下命令到各有关部门去抽调。到目前为止，许多单位却用种种借口，一拖再拖、拒不抽调。如确定抽调商业厅所属煤业建筑器材公司的一个经理、百货公司一个计划科长、土产公司一个秘书科长到省建筑工程管理局工作，先后下了两次命令，这些公司不但拖延不调反强调自己业务重要，申请免调，后虽口头上表示同意，但到现在迟迟未曾调出。中国人民银行浙江省分行人事科有一个正科长和两个副科长，这次省人民政府人事厅决定抽出一个副科长到省建筑工程管理局工作，在一月二日、六日两次下令都没有调出来。更严重的是有些单位还留着大批的技术人员不肯放。如省盐务管理局今年没有什么大的基本建设任务，却留着十七个土木工程技术人员（其中有四个工程师）。省工业厅在上月底下令抽调到省建筑工程管理局技术设计部门集中使用，该局拖到现在一个未放。由于许多部门从本位主义出发，不照顾全面，抗拒抽调技术人员和干部的命令，已经影响了今年基本建设设计和施工部门计划的如期完成。浙江省建筑工程管理局今年担任的设计和施工的任务占全省基本建设任务的百分之六十以上，然而该局的技术设计室人员尚缺一半以上，新成立的施工科还没有一个人，需要六、七个工程师的计划科，只有一个工程师。根据现在的情况，该局第一季度的设计任务，将只能完成三分之一左右，许多第二季度就要施工的工程，就成问题。现中共浙江省委员会和浙江省人民政府人事厅已检查了这些情况，将坚决克服这些部门领导人员的本位主义思想，贯彻抽调人员的命令，以迅速完成基本建设的准备工作。　（新华社）
