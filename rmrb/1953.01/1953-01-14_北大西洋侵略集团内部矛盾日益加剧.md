    Internal Contradictions Within the North Atlantic Aggression Bloc Intensify

    The contradictions and disputes within the North Atlantic aggression bloc are becoming increasingly prominent. American reactionary newspapers are commenting more and more frequently on topics such as "West European rebellion," "Strong anti-American sentiment in Western Europe," "The split of the North Atlantic Group," and "The crisis of the North Atlantic policy." A United Press International dispatch from Paris on the first day, in reviewing the situation of the North Atlantic Group in 1952, admitted that "direct conflicts have developed" within the Western bloc.

    This trend of division within the North Atlantic Group is determined by the nature of the group itself. The group was organized by the United States in 1949. The United States dominates everything within this group. Currently, the fourteen countries participating in this group are the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Turkey, and Greece. Although this group hangs the deceptive signboard of a "defensive alliance," all activities of this group for more than three years have demonstrated that it is an alliance for aggression and war. At the same time, the United States uses this alliance as a tool to occupy Western Europe and enslave Western Europe. The United States has obtained unlimited possibilities for military occupation of Western Europe and for political and economic interference in Western Europe through this alliance. The Western European countries occupied by the American army have in fact become American colonies. The United States has forced Western European countries to massively expand their armies and prepare for war, destroying the Western European economy, impoverishing the lives of the Western European people, and exposing the Western European people to the threat of a recurrence of West German militarist aggression, and the threat of destruction in a new war. The facts are very clear: the aggressive goals of the North Atlantic Group conflict with the national interests of the member states participating in this group. Precisely for this reason, this alliance has not received the support of the people from the beginning. The increasing resistance of the Western European masses to this alliance has frustrated the alliance's war preparations at every step. This resistance of the masses is the fundamental factor causing the North Atlantic Group to tend toward disintegration.

    The ruling groups of Western European countries have sold out national sovereignty, joined this group, followed the United States in engaging in anti-Soviet war preparations, and relied on the United States to suppress domestic peace and democratic forces. However, this commonality of anti-Soviet and anti-people goals cannot eliminate the contradictions of interest between them. Since the North Atlantic Group is an aggressive alliance, the relationship between its member states will inevitably be based on the law of the jungle. The relationship between the United States ruling group and the ruling groups of other countries is not the "equal relationship" touted in American propaganda, but the relationship between rider and horse. The American commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Group army and the American ambassadors to Western European countries act like governors, arrogantly directing and reprimanding the ruling figures of Western European countries.

    The United States' forced large-scale expansion of armaments and war preparations on Western European countries, and its forcing Western European countries to sever trade with Eastern Europe, has resulted in the Western European bourgeoisie being trapped in a quagmire of severe economic crisis. Taking advantage of Western Europe's economic difficulties, the United States is massively plundering the raw materials and sales markets of British and French colonies, and seizing control of Western European domestic industries.

    At the same time, the United States is supporting West German militarist forces in Western Europe as its main accomplice. The United States is also using the method of sacrificing Western European countries to satisfy the increasingly arrogant demands of West German militarists. Outside the North Atlantic "Great" Group, the United States is also organizing the "West German and Italian Axis" and the "West German and Franco-Spanish Axis" to attack the power of Britain and France. The United States is also organizing a "European Group" with West German militarism as its core to weaken Britain's position on the European continent.

    This American offensive against the actual interests of the Western European bourgeoisie cannot but intensify the friction and disputes between the United States and the ruling groups of Western European countries. The American overlord naturally cannot but encounter resistance from its Western European "allies," first and foremost resistance from the British ruling group. In the second half of 1951, within the North Atlantic "Great" Group, there appeared the so-called "European Core" that resisted American arbitrariness. By the second half of 1952, a Western European group led by Britain, demanding a reduction in the arms expansion targets set by the United States, had emerged. Britain is also secretly trying to undermine the effective formation of the "European Group." The United States has also encountered resistance from the French bourgeoisie in supporting the West German militarist forces.

    Behind the veil of "harmonious cooperation" in the official statements frequently issued by the United States and Western European governments, there is actually a scene of infighting and contention. In this regard, the example of the US-British struggle for military command of the North Atlantic Group is quite illustrative. After the Americans occupied the position of Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Group's armed forces in 1950, the struggle between the United States and Britain shifted to the Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Navies. The United States originally planned to appoint an American general as Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Navy in early 1951, but due to strong opposition from Britain, the dispute lasted for nearly a year. It was not until the beginning of 1952 that it was decided under American pressure that American McCormick would serve as commander-in-chief, while Britain still refused to hand over the British Navy around the British Isles to McCormick. On the issue of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Navy, the United States has always wanted to obtain this position, but it has also encountered strong opposition from Britain. After nearly two years of arguing, an agreement was reached at the end of 1952 to appoint British Mountbatten as the commander of the Mediterranean Navy, but the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean was still not under Mountbatten's command, and Mountbatten was also under the jurisdiction of the American Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Group's forces. This agreement clearly did not eliminate the contradictions between the United States and Britain in the Mediterranean. Under such disputes and contradictions, there is naturally no real cooperation. When the United States gathered the navies of various vassal states in the Mediterranean for exercises in November 1952, the "cooperation" provided by Britain was only to send a minelaying boat, some submarines, and some aircraft to participate.

    With the disastrous defeat of the United States in Korea, the deepening of Western Europe's economic difficulties, and the intensification of the United States' arming of West Germany, the contradictions and disputes within the North Atlantic Group became increasingly apparent in 1951 and 1952. This trend is significantly reflected in the highest body of the North Atlantic Group - the North Atlantic Group Council meetings. These meetings have become meetings full of disputes, with American representatives routinely angrily reprimanding Western European countries at the meetings, and Western European representatives also making tit-for-tat remarks. The two meetings of the Council held in Ottawa and Rome in 1951 were both disputes, failing to reach agreements on the issue of expanding arms and preparing for war and arming West Germany. Under American pressure, the Lisbon Conference in February 1952 passed a resolution on Western Europe's massive expansion of arms targets. However, just after the Lisbon resolution was passed, bourgeois newspapers in Britain and France said that the resolution "could not be fulfilled." By the Paris meeting in December 1952, the arms expansion targets passed at the Lisbon meeting were officially overturned.

    At present, the arms expansion work of the North Atlantic Group has fallen into a state of paralysis. In view of its own economic crisis, Western European countries have slowed down the pace of arms expansion. The voices of condemnation and complaint between the United States and Western Europe have formed a vicious circle: Western European countries say to the United States, unless you give more money, the arms expansion plan cannot be completed; the United States says to its Western European "partners," unless you accelerate arms expansion, even the current amount of money will not be given.

    This scene of the North Atlantic Group has caused great anxiety to the American ruling group. American Republican Senator Younger, former President Hoover, and Kennedy, who once served as the US ambassador to Britain, have all said that the military plan formulated by the United States for Western Europe may fail, anti-American sentiment in Europe is rising, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has encountered a crisis. Many American reactionary figures have begun to doubt the future of the North Atlantic Group, fearing that this alliance will not receive popular support and will eventually collapse due to internal conflicts.

    In order to find a way out of the crisis of the North Atlantic Group, the only means that the United States is currently hoping for is to intensify the pressure on Western Europe. The "New York Times," the mouthpiece of the American ruling group, openly declared in November 1952 that the United States needs to apply "constant pressure" to its Western European "allies," and once the United States "loosens the reins," they will "scatter immediately." The US government plans to exert pressure in various ways to force Western European countries to step up war preparations and hand over the remaining sovereignty. The current Truman administration in the United States is doing this, and the incoming Eisenhower administration has also revealed that it will do so. Of course, the United States still has enough puppets in the governments of Western European countries, and may be able to force the governments of Western European countries to add some divisions of troops and implement some measures that cede power and humiliate the country. However, such a result will not enhance the United States' position in Western Europe, but will only make the position of the United States and the Western European rulers who have turned to the United States even weaker and more isolated. Now, the rulers of Western Europe not only do not have the support of the broad masses of the people, but also do not have the support of the entire bourgeoisie. Among the bourgeoisie in Britain, France and other countries, a considerable number of people have openly demanded a fundamental change in the foreign policy subordinate to the United States. American pressure on Western Europe cannot change the trend of disintegration of the North Atlantic Group; on the contrary, it can only accelerate this trend.

### 北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾日益加剧

    北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾日益加剧
    北大西洋侵略集团内部的矛盾和争吵越来越显著了。美国反动报纸越来越频繁地评论着这样的主题：如“西欧的反叛”、“西欧强烈的反美情绪”、“北大西洋集团的分裂”以及“北大西洋政策的危机”等。合众社巴黎一日电在回顾一九五二年北大西洋集团的情况时，承认：西方集团内部的“直接冲突发展了”。
    北大西洋集团这种分裂趋势是这个集团本身的性质所决定的。这个集团是美国在一九四九年组织起来的。美国在这个集团中主宰着一切。目前参加这个集团的有美国、英国、法国、意大利、加拿大、冰岛、挪威、丹麦、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、葡萄牙、土耳其、希腊等十四国。尽管这个集团挂着
    “防御联盟”的骗人招牌，但是这个集团三年多来的一切活动都说明了：这个集团是一个侵略与战争的联盟。同时，美国利用这个联盟为工具来霸占西欧，奴役西欧。美国通过这个联盟取得了军事占领西欧、对西欧实行政治及经济干涉的无限可能性。美国军队占领下的西欧各国，实际上已在沦为美国的殖民地。美国强迫西欧各国大规模扩军备战，破坏了西欧的经济，使西欧人民生活贫困，并使西欧人民面临着西德军国主义侵略再演的威胁，面临着在新战争中毁灭的威胁。事实十分明显：北大西洋集团的侵略目标是与参加这个集团的各成员国的民族利益相冲突的。正因为这样，这个联盟自始就得不到人民的支持。西欧人民群众日益增强对这个联盟的反抗，使这个联盟的备战措施着着遭到挫败。人民群众的这种反抗，是使北大西洋集团趋于分崩离析的根本因素。
    西欧各国统治集团出卖了民族主权，参加了这个集团，跟随着美国进行准备反苏战争的勾当，并依靠美国来镇压国内的和平民主力量。但是，这种反苏反人民的目标的一致性，丝毫也不能消除他们之间的利害矛盾。北大西洋集团既然是侵略联盟，它的成员国之间的关系就不可避免地要建立在弱肉强食的基础上。美国统治集团及其他国家统治集团之间的关系，并不是美国宣传中所吹嘘的“平等关系”，而是骑马者与马的关系。美国籍的北大西洋集团军队总司令和美国驻西欧各国的大使俨然以总督自居，高傲地指挥着和斥责着西欧各国的统治人物。
    美国强迫西欧各国大规模扩军备战，强迫西欧各国断绝与东欧的贸易，其结果使西欧各国资产阶级陷入严重经济危机的泥潭。美国乘着西欧这种经济困难，大规模地掠夺着英国及法国殖民地的原料和销货市场，夺取着西欧各国国内工业的控制权。
    同时，美国在西欧扶植西德军国主义势力作为它的主要帮凶。美国也是用牺牲西欧各国的办法，来满足西德军国主义者日益狂妄的要求。在北大西洋
    “大”集团之外，美国又在组织“西德及意大利轴心”、“西德及佛朗哥西班牙轴心”，来打击英国及法国的势力。美国并组织以西德军国主义为核心的“欧洲集团”，来削弱英国在欧洲大陆上的地位。
    美国这种对西欧各国资产阶级实际权益的进攻，自然不能不加剧美国与西欧各国统治集团间的磨擦与争吵。美国霸主自然就不能不遭到西欧“盟友”的抵抗，首先是英国统治集团的抵抗。在一九五一年下半年，在北大西洋“大”集团中，即出现所谓反抗美国专断一切的所谓“欧洲核心”。到一九五二年下半年，又出现了英国领导的要求削减美国所规定的扩军目标的西欧集团。英国并且在暗地里竭力破坏“欧洲集团”的有效形成。在扶植西德军国主义势力上，美国也遭到法国资产阶级的抵抗。
    在美国与西欧各国政府所经常发表的“融洽合作”的官方声明的帷幕之后，实际上是钩心斗角、你争我夺的场面。在这方面，美英两国争夺北大西洋集团军事指挥权的例子颇能说明问题。在一九五○年美国人占据了北大西洋集团军队总司令的地位后，美英两国的斗争即转至北大西洋及地中海海军总司令上。美国原定在一九五一年初即任命美国将领担任北大西洋海军总司令，但由于遭到英国的激烈反对，争执不下几达一年。到一九五二年初才在美国高压下决定由美国人麦考米克担任总司令，而英国仍拒绝把英伦三岛周围的英国海军交给麦考米克指挥。在地中海海军总司令问题上，美国一直想取得这个位置，但同样遭到英国的激烈反对。争吵了几达二年，到一九五二年底才获得一项协议，任命英国人蒙巴顿担任地中海海军司令，而美国在地中海的第六舰队仍不归蒙巴顿指挥，并且蒙巴顿还要在北大西洋集团军队总司令美国人李奇微的管辖之下。这项协议显然并没有消除美英两国在地中海的矛盾。在这种争吵与矛盾下，自然谈不上真正的合作。在一九五二年十一月美国纠集地中海各仆从国家海军举行演习时，英国所提供的“合作”仅仅是派一艘布雷艇，一些潜水艇和一些飞机参加。
    随着美国在朝鲜的惨败、西欧经济困难的加深、美国武装西德的加紧，北大西洋集团内部的矛盾与争吵在一九五一年及一九五二年已日益趋于表面化。这种趋向显著地反映在北大西洋集团的最高机构——北大西洋集团理事会会议中。这种会议已经成为充满了争吵的会议，美国代表照例在会上恼怒地斥责西欧各国，而西欧各国代表也发表针锋相对的言论。理事会在一九五一年于渥太华及罗马举行的二次会议，都是争吵一场，未能在扩军备战及武装西德问题上获致协议。在美国的高压下，一九五二年二月的里斯本会议通过了西欧庞大扩军目标的决议。然而，在里斯本决议刚通过之后，英法等国资产阶级报纸就说决议“不能兑现”了。到一九五二年十二月巴黎会议中，里斯本会议所通过的扩军目标就被正式推翻了。
    目前，北大西洋集团的扩军工作已陷于瘫痪状态。西欧国家鉴于本身经济危机，都放慢了扩军速度。美国与西欧间的斥责和抱怨的声音形成了这样一种恶性循环：西欧国家对美国说，除非你给更多的钱，不然就完不成扩军计划；美国对它的西欧“伙伴”说，除非你加速扩军，不然连目前这点钱也不给。
    北大西洋集团这种景象引起了美国统治集团的极大焦虑。美国共和党参议员扬格、前总统胡佛、一度任美国驻英大使肯尼第等人都曾经说：美国为西欧拟定的军事计划可能失败，欧洲的反美情绪日益高涨，北大西洋公约组织遭到了危机。许多美国反动人物开始怀疑北大西洋集团的前途，他们害怕这个联盟得不到人民支持，终将由于内部冲突而垮台。
    为了自北大西洋集团的危机中找寻出路，美国目前所指望的唯一手段是加紧对西欧使用压力。美国统治集团喉舌“纽约时报”在一九五二年十一月公然宣称：美国对它的西欧“盟国”需要加以“经常的压力”，一旦美国“放松了缰绳”，它们就会“立刻奔散”。美国政府计划通过各种方式行使压力，逼使西欧国家加紧备战，并交出残余的主权。美国现任杜鲁门政府正在这样做，即将上台的艾森豪威尔政府也已透露要这样做。当然，美国目前在西欧各国政府中还有足够的傀儡，也许能够逼使西欧各国政府增添若干师军队，实行一些丧权辱国的措施。但是，这样的结果并不能增强美国在西欧的地位，只会使美国和投靠美国的西欧统治者的地位更加削弱，处境更加孤立。现在，西欧的统治者不仅得不到广大人民的支持，而且也得不到全部资产阶级的支持。在英法等国资产阶级中，已有相当一部分人公开要求根本改变从属美国的外交政策了。美国对西欧的压力并不能改变北大西洋集团分崩离析的趋势，相反地，只能加速这种趋势。（新华社）
