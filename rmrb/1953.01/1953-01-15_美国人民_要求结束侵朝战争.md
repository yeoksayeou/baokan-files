Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 14th: The New York "Daily Worker" of January 8th, in a dispatch from San Francisco, stated, "Judging from the letters to the editor columns of local business newspapers, the public is becoming increasingly impatient with the United States' insistence on 'voluntary' repatriation of prisoners of war as the price for a Korean armistice."

The "Daily Worker" reprinted a letter from William E. Connors published in the "San Francisco News." Connors' letter affirmed that "the detaining nation has absolutely no right to discriminate against prisoners of war based on their personal likes or dislikes of political and governmental systems."

Connors continued, "When prisoners of war come into our hands, all we should do is give them humane treatment, supply them with food to sustain life, provide them with shelter from the elements, and return them to their own country when the war is over."

Connors said that if the Geneva Convention's provisions on the exchange of prisoners of war were followed, the prisoner of war dispute could have been resolved "within a week."

The "Daily Worker" reported that on New Year's Day, a reporter from the "Erie Times" in Erie, Pennsylvania, asked five people in the city, "What are your hopes for 1953?" They all replied that their first hope was an armistice in Korea.

Worker Randolph Sultz replied, "I hope the Korean War ends in 1953. I also hope that peace will come to the whole world—not just to Korea..."

Housewife Mrs. Waldo Anderson replied, "I have a few good friends in Korea, so my biggest hope for 1953 is naturally an armistice in Korea. A Korean armistice would be a blessing for many people. In short, this is the main topic of conversation for everyone in most countries around the world. If the war ends this year, things will be much better."

Veteran Richard Thomas said, "I hope to get a good job in 1953. I was recently discharged. I hope the Korean War ends... Eisenhower is president, and we may all be back in uniform again..."

Student John Pijakko said, "My biggest hope this year is an armistice in Korea. I don't see any purpose in this war. Therefore, I don't see any reason not to end it. I have three good friends over there, and they probably feel the same way. If you take a poll of the nation, this must be the only hope of the people of the whole country."

Female student Joan Hippolin replied, "I think we've fought enough wars. Therefore, I hope the Korean War ends in 1953... Why can't we have peace from now on?"

### 美国人民  要求结束侵朝战争

    美国人民
    要求结束侵朝战争
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】纽约“工人日报”一月八日的旧金山消息说，“从当地商业报纸的读者来信栏可以看出，公众对于美国坚持‘自愿’遣返战俘作为朝鲜停战的代价，已愈来愈感到不耐烦。”
    “工人日报”转载了“旧金山新闻”登的威廉·意·康纳斯的信，康纳斯的信肯定了这一点：“拘留战俘的国家绝对无权就战俘个人对政治和政府制度的好恶而加以甄别”。
    康纳斯继续说，“当战俘到我们手里的时候，我们应当做的一切只是给他们以人道的待遇，供应他们维持生活的食物，供给他们不受风吹雨打的住所，并在战争结束时把他们送回他们自己的国家去。”
    康纳斯说，只要遵守日内瓦公约关于交换战俘的条款，战俘争执本可以“在一星期之内”就获得解决的。
    “工人日报”说，宾夕法尼亚州艾利城的“艾利时报”记者，在元旦那天在该城先后问了五个人，问他们“你的一九五三年的希望是什么？”他们全回答说，他们第一个希望就是朝鲜停战。
    工人伦多夫·苏尔兹回答说，“我希望朝鲜战争在一九五三年结束。我还希望，和平会降临到全世界——不光是降临到朝鲜。……”
    家庭主妇华尔道·安得逊太太回答说：“我有少数几个很好的朋友在朝鲜，因此我对一九五三年的最大的希望自然是朝鲜停战。朝鲜停战对于许多的人都会是幸事。总之，这是全世界大多数国家每个人谈话的主要题目。只要战争在今年结束，情形就会好得多了。”
    退伍兵士李嘉德·汤马斯说：“我希望在一九五三年获得一个好职业。我是最近退伍的。我希望朝鲜战争结束。……艾森豪威尔当了总统，我们全都可能重新穿起制服来。……”
    学生约翰·皮杰柯说，“今年我最大的希望就是朝鲜停战。我看不出这个战争有什么目标。因此我看不出不结束这个战争的理由。我有三个好朋友在那儿，他们可能也有同感。如果你给全国来个民意测验，这也一定是全国人民唯一的希望。”
    女学生裘因·希波林回答道：“我认为我们战争已打够了。因此我希望在一九五三年朝鲜战争结束。……为什么我们不能从现在起就获得和平呢？”
