Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Washington dispatch: In order to promote its so-called "liberation" policy, the Eisenhower government is intensifying its deceptive propaganda and espionage activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and has ordered the establishment of new special service guidance agencies and espionage training institutions.

    The White House announced on the 26th the establishment of the "President's Board on International Intelligence Activities" and appointed William Jackson, one of the top American spies and former Deputy Director of the "Central Intelligence Agency," as chairman of the committee. According to the US Information Agency, the committee's work is to "investigate and assess the government's various intelligence and related policies and activities, particularly policies and activities related to international relations and national security." The objects "studied" by the committee include the "US Information Agency," "Voice of America," "Psychological Strategy Board," and "Central Intelligence Agency."

    Meanwhile, Walter Smith, the American spy chief recently appointed as Undersecretary of State and former Director of the "Central Intelligence Agency," revealed at a meeting of the National Security Committee of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on the 25th that the US government is establishing a new "corps of professional officers" whose "profession" is to "gather information in foreign countries." In addition to "basic training" in espionage, these "information-gathering" agents will also receive officer training apparently designed to organize and command armed rebellions.

    美国政府设立新的特务机构
    加紧对民主阵营进行间谍破坏活动
    【新华社二十九日讯】华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔政府为了推行它的所谓“解放”政策，加紧进行反对苏联及人民民主国家的欺骗宣传与间谍活动，已下令成立新的特务指导机构和间谍训练机关。
    白宫在二十六日宣布设立“总统国际情报活动委员会”，并任命美国特务头子之一、前“中央情报局”副局长威廉·杰克逊为委员会主席。据美国新闻处的介绍，委员会的工作是“调查与估计政府的各种情报与有关政策及活动，特别关于国际关系与国家安全的政策与活动”。委员会“研究的”对象包括“美国新闻处”、“美国之音”、“心理战略局”与“中央情报局”。
    同时，新被任命为副国务卿的美国特务头子、原“中央情报局”局长华尔特·史密斯二十五日在退伍军人团国家安全委员会会议上透露：美国政府正在建立一支新的“职业军官队”，这些所谓职业军官的“职业”是“在外国探听情况”。这些“探听情况”的特务除了受间谍的“基本训练”以外，还要受显然是为了组织和指挥武装叛乱的军官训练。
