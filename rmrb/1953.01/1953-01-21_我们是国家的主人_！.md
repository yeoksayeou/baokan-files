To the Editor: There is something that makes me excited, thrilled, and joyful. I would like to share this feeling with others.

The matter is actually a small one. People who have walked the road from downtown Beijing to the Summer Palace know that after passing Peking University (the original Yenching University site), the road goes directly west; but not far after Guajiatun, there is a ninety-degree turn to the north; after about a hundred meters, at Yimuyuan, there is another ninety-degree turn to the west; and after walking less than a hundred meters, on the east side of the North China People's Revolutionary University, you have to cross a very narrow small stone bridge before you are back on the straight road. Many vehicles pass through this section of road every day. Driving is very difficult and accidents can easily occur. Last year, one Sunday, I made a special trip to observe it for a long time. I wanted to improve this situation, and there are two ways: one, to increase the angle of the turns and widen the small bridge. Two, a more thorough solution is to open a new, wider section of road from Guajiatun to near the gate of the North China People's Revolutionary University. This would of course take up some cultivated land, but the benefits to people's lives and traffic safety would be great.

In 1951, the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference opened. We all discussed what we wanted the People's Government to do. I wrote down my suggestion for building a new road from Guajiatun to the gate of the North China People's Revolutionary University, and drew a picture, and gave it to the People's Representative of our school. Afterwards, I thought: the country has so many big things to do; if this little thing was worth doing, the People's Government would have done it long ago. Therefore, I gradually forgot about it.

Last year, on November 9th, when I was taking a car into the city and passed that place, I saw people building a road: tents and telephone poles were newly erected, water pumps were pumping water, the roadbed was being laid in the fields, and people were working. The new line had been under construction for more than just a day, but I only recently discovered it. After returning in the afternoon, I took another trip to the construction site. Sure enough, it was being built according to my suggestion.

Comrade, you don't know what my mood was like at that time. I really wanted to sing loudly, I really wanted to pick up a carrying pole and a basket and carry some soil myself. I found the road construction workers especially lovable, and I also felt happy in advance for the people who would be riding in cars through here in the future. Everything around me was so good: the electric lights were so bright, the river water was so clear, and people were so kind.

I also thought: this plan may not necessarily be the one I proposed in advance, maybe it was proposed by the residents here, maybe it was proposed by the car driver comrades who travel this road,.... But no matter who proposed it, it is the same, it was proposed by our Beijing citizens,.... and our own government followed suit.

Our country is such a country: our people can freely express opinions and ask the People's Government to do things for us. If we find it inconvenient to walk, we ask them to build roads for us; if we think the well water is not sweet, we ask them to install tap water,.... We are so confident and justified. And as long as these requests are correct and feasible, the People's Government will do so. Only our own people's government is like this. I feel especially proud, I feel that I am standing especially straight, and my enthusiasm for life is even greater. I think: this is the feeling of being the master of the country.

Since we are the masters of the country, can we still ignore the affairs of the country? The revolutionary martyrs paid the most precious price for us to win such happiness, and I also have such determination: in order to defend our happiness, I am willing to give my own life if necessary.

    “我们是国家的主人”！
    编辑同志：有一件事使我激动、兴奋、喜悦。我愿意把这种感情分给其他人。
    事情倒是一件小事。在从北京城区到颐和园的路上走过的人们都知道：过了北京大学（原燕京大学校址）后，公路一直向西；但过挂甲屯不远，便有一个九十度的向北转弯；再过约一百公尺后，在一亩园那里又是一个九十度的向西转弯；再走不到一百公尺，在华北人民革命大学的东边，还得过一个很窄的小石桥，才又是直的大路了。这一段路每天都有很多的车辆经过。行车很困难，而且很容易发生交通事故。去年一个星期日，我特别到那里观察好久。我想要改善这个情况，有两个方法：一，加大拐弯处的角度并加宽小桥。二，比较彻底的办法是从挂甲屯到华北人民革命大学校门附近，新开一段较宽的路。这当然要占些耕地，但对人民生活和交通安全的好处是很大的。
    一九五一年北京市各界人民代表会议开幕了。我们都讨论我们要人民政府作些什么事。我呢，就把新修挂甲屯到华北人民革命大学门口公路的建议写出来，并且画了一张图，交给了我校的人民代表。事后，我想：国家有多少大事要作啊；这点小事要是值得作，人民政府早就作了。因此，也就把这事慢慢地忘了。
    去年十一月九日，我坐汽车进城路过那个地方时，看见了有人在修路：帐篷和电杆新架起来了，抽水机在抽水，田地里正垫路基，人们在劳动着。新线动工不止是一天了，可是我最近才发现。下午回来后，我又到工地走了一趟。可不千真万确，就是按我的建议在修路哩。
    同志啊，你不知道我当时是什么样的心情，我真想大声歌唱，真想拿起扁担和筐亲身去抬一会土。我发觉修路的工人特别可爱，也预先为将来坐车经过这儿的人感到幸福。我周围的一切是多么地好：电灯那么亮，河水那么清，人都那么和气。
    我又想：这个计划也许不一定是我预先提的那个，也许是这儿的居民提的，也许是来往这条路上的汽车司机同志提的，……。但不论是谁提的都一样，都是咱们北京的市民提的，……咱们自己的政府就照办了。
    我们的国家就是这样的国家：我们人民可以自由发表意见，要求人民政府为我们作事。我们走路不方便，就要求给我们修路；我们嫌喝井水不甜，就要求装自来水，……。我们是那么理直气壮。而只要这些要求是正确的、可以办到的，人民政府就会照办。只有我们人民自己的政府才这样。我感到特别骄傲，我感到腰板挺的特别直，我生活的劲头也更大了。我想：这就是国家主人翁的感觉。
    我们既是国家的主人，那对国家的事还能不管吗？革命先烈们为我们争取这样的幸福付出了最珍贵的代价，我也有这样的决心：为了保卫我们的幸福，必要时我情愿付出我自己的生命。 韩国栋
