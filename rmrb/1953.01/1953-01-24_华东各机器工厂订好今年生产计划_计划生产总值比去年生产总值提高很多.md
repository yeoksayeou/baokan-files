Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 23rd: The work of formulating this year's production plans by state-owned and joint state-private machine factories in East China has been largely completed. According to statistics from fourteen key factories, the planned total output value for this year has increased by 87% compared to the actual total output value of last year.

The main products of state-owned and joint state-private machine factories in East China are industrial and mining machinery, civil engineering and construction machinery, and various types of machine tools. To support basic construction in various regions, this year, factories will not only increase the output of these existing products but also produce large-scale steam turbines, high-speed diesel engines, new-style mineral processing machines, precision machine tools, and heavy-duty cranes, which have not been manufactured in our country before. Thus, how to fully utilize existing production potential has become a problem that each factory must research and solve when formulating this year's plans.

Many factories, when planning this year's production tasks, first adjusted the original unbalanced production equipment based on the results of last year's production capacity assessment. For example, during the production capacity assessment at Qiujiang Machine Factory, it was found that the production capacity of shapers, bevel gear milling machines, and internal grinders in the metalworking workshop was lacking 42,000 machine-hours, while the production capacity of lathes, universal milling machines, and universal grinders was surplus by more than 220,000 machine-hours. Therefore, the factory decided to use the surplus universal milling machines to supplement the bevel gear milling machines, and the surplus universal grinders to supplement the internal grinders. At the same time, the surplus lathes, vertical milling machines, and gear grinders were used to strengthen the tool and repair workshops. This has comprehensively improved the utilization rate of the factory's equipment, thereby enabling it to undertake more production tasks. Because many factories lack manufacturing experience with many new products, and a large number of technical personnel have been transferred to support national basic construction this year, they must overcome the difficulties of insufficient technical conditions when formulating this year's production plans. Wusong Machine Factory recently transferred one-third of its technical personnel to support basic construction, but the factory's planned output for this year will increase by about one and a half times compared to last year's actual output. At the same time, it must design and manufacture a variety of important and complex new products. To overcome this difficulty, the factory concentrated all the technical personnel of various functional departments and the backbone members of the locomotive workshop, and adopted the method of collective research to plan this year's production, and mobilized all the workers and staff to discuss the monthly and quarterly work plans. As a result, the planned targets were greatly improved. For example, when workers and staff discussed the production plan for manufacturing high-speed diesel engines, they put forward many rationalization proposals, which reduced the labor quota for the important component "governor gear" by 64% and the labor quota for drilling fuel injectors by 40%. As a result, the planned output target of diesel engines increased by 43.5%. The factory also plans to train 150 engineers and technicians this year to strengthen the existing design force and production technology management work. After the production plans of Qiujiang Machine Factory, Shanghai Tool Factory, and Jinan Machine Factory No. 4 were discussed by the workers and staff, the planned production targets were all increased by about 20%. General, Wusong, and fifteen other factories also formulated detailed technical improvement plans when compiling the annual production plan, and included the labor productivity that could be improved by implementing technical improvement measures when formulating production targets. The technical improvement measures of General Machine Factory this year include: promoting high-speed cutting, improving machine tools such as hexagon lathes, learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in "doing a good job in and inspecting pre-production preparation," and promoting rationalization proposals. Through these measures, the factory's planned output target has increased by about 15%.

This year, each factory is also required to greatly reduce production costs compared to the past. When formulating this year's cost plan, many factories carefully checked the past records of raw material consumption and labor wages, management expenses, and other materials to verify production costs. After verifying costs, the selling prices of various state-owned machine factories in Shanghai this year were reduced by 12% to 27% compared to last year. Because the products of these factories are sold directly to state organs, this can save a large amount of working capital for the state.

### 华东各机器工厂订好今年生产计划  计划生产总值比去年生产总值提高很多

    华东各机器工厂订好今年生产计划
    计划生产总值比去年生产总值提高很多
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东各国营和公私合营机器工厂制定今年生产计划的工作已大体结束。根据十四个重点厂的统计，今年计划生产总值比去年实际生产总值提高了百分之八十七。
    华东各国营和公私合营机器厂的主要产品为工矿机、土木建筑机器和各式工作母机。为了支援各地基本建设，今年各厂不但要提高原有这些产品的产量，同时还要生产过去我国没有制造过的大型蒸汽透平、高速柴油机、新式选矿机、精密工作母机和重型起重机等机器装备。这样，如何充分发挥现有的生产潜力，就成为各厂今年制订计划必须研究解决的问题。
    许多工厂在计划今年生产任务时，首先根据去年下半年生产能力查定的结果，对原有不平衡的生产设备进行了调整。例如虬江机器厂在生产能力查定时，发现金工车间的牛头刨、锥形齿轮铣床和内圆磨床等的生产能力缺少四万二千台时，而车床、万能铣床和万能磨床等的生产能力却多余二十二万多台时，因此该厂就决定把多余的万能铣床用去补充锥形齿轮铣床，用多余的万能磨床去补充内圆磨床，同时还把多余的车床、立铣床和齿磨床等去加强工具和修理等车间。这样就使厂里的设备利用率得到了全面的提高，从而能够承担起更多的生产任务。各厂由于对许多新产品缺乏制造经验，加以今年又抽调出大批技术人员支援国家基本建设，因而在制定今年生产计划时都必须克服技术条件不足的困难。吴淞机器厂最近抽调出三分之一的技术人员支援基本建设，但该厂今年的计划产量比去年实产量增加一倍半左右，同时还要设计制造多种重要、复杂的新产品。为了克服这个困难，该厂集中了各职能科所有的技术人员机车间职工中的骨干分子，采取集体研究的办法来计划今年的生产，并且发动全厂职工讨论分月、分季的作业计划。结果，大大提高了计划指标。例如职工在讨论制造高速柴油机的生产计划时，提出了许多合理化建议，使重要部件“调速齿轮”的工时定额降低了百分之六十四，钻喷油器的工时定额降低了百分之四十，结果柴油机的计划产量指标提高了百分之四十三点五。该厂并计划在今年内培养出一百五十个工程师和技术员，以加强现有的设计力量和生产技术管理工作。虬江机器厂、上海工具厂和济南机器四厂等的生产计划经职工群众讨论后，计划生产指标都提高了百分之二十左右。通用、吴淞等十五个厂在编制年度生产计划时还订出了周密的技术改进措施计划，并且在制定生产指标时，把推行技术改进措施所能提高的劳动生产率也估计在内。通用机器厂今年的技术改进措施有：推行高速切削、改进六角车床等工作母机、学习苏联“做好和检查生产前准备工作”的先进经验和推行合理化建议等四项。经过这些措施，该厂的计划产量指标提高了百分之十五左右。
    今年各厂的生产成本也要求比过去大大降低。许多厂在制订今年的成本计划时，都比较缜密细致地查对了过去的原材料消耗记录和劳动工资、管理费用等材料，核实了生产成本。在上海的各国营机器厂经过核实成本后，今年的售货价格比去年降低了百分之十二到二十七。由于这些厂的产品都是直接卖给国家机关部门，这样就能为国家节省一大笔流动资金。
