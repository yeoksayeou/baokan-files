To Commander Peng Dehuai, all commanders, fighters, political workers, and logistics personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    As you are achieving new victories on the front lines, we, the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, are being held in the capital. We hereby represent all members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in extending our highest respect to you, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades!

    For two years, your heroic and tenacious battles have dealt heavy blows to the American aggressors, supported the just war of the Korean people, defended the security and construction of the motherland, and pointed out a truth to the people of the world – the American imperialist aggression can be defeated.

    Our motherland is leaping forward. The people of the whole country are engaged in an unprecedented battle to meet the three major political tasks of the state. Our conference has focused on discussing how to meet these three great tasks and unanimously guarantees to respond to the great call of the motherland with practical actions. We guarantee to do a good job in the specific tasks stipulated by the China Resist America Aid Korea General Association, to support the heroic cause of our heroic People's Volunteer Army in resisting the American bandits on the front lines, and to strive for greater victories!

    Our meeting is scheduled to close today. Looking at the Korean battlefront from the magnificent capital, our hearts are closely connected with yours. We sincerely wish: Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Long live the victory of the Chinese people's resistance to America and aid to Korea! Long live the great fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
        The Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
