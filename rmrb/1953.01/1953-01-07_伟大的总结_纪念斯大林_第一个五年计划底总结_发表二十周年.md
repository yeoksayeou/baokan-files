Great Summary
    ——Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the Publication of Stalin's "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan"
    By A·奥夫卡洛娃 (A·Aofkalova), Soviet Union
    Twenty years ago, on January 7, 1933, Comrade Stalin delivered a historically significant report on the summary of the first Five-Year Plan at the joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Supervisory Committee. The leader of the Party gave a profound scientific analysis of the enormous achievements made by the Soviet people in the political, economic, and cultural life of the country during the first Five-Year Plan period (1928-1932).
    In 1926, after completing the restoration of the national economy which had suffered damage during the First World War, foreign armed intervention, and the civil war, the Soviet Union began the country's socialist industrialization. The basic task of the Five-Year Plan, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, was to transform the Soviet Union from a technically and economically backward agricultural country into "a powerful and independent industrial country that does not depend in any way on the will of world capitalism" [1].
    The restoration and development of heavy industry was the basis for realizing this great plan. "Because only heavy industry can transform and revitalize the entire industry, transportation, and agriculture." [2] However, the restoration and development of heavy industry required huge capital construction and large amounts of funds. Where could this necessary funding be found in such a backward and impoverished country at that time?
    Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report: "To stipulate extremely strict saving measures, and to accumulate the funds necessary to subsidize our industrialization—this is the path we should take to achieve the restoration of heavy industry and the realization of the Five-Year Plan." [3]
    This was a difficult road, but the Soviet people, under the encouragement of the Lenin-Stalin Party, overcame this difficulty victoriously. The first Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule—in four years and three months. Within this short period, the Soviet Union created the foundation of a socialist economy. The heroic labor of workers, peasants, and Soviet intellectuals under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party guaranteed this historically significant victory. During these years, a mass socialist competition among workers was launched, which later developed into a communist method of building socialism.
    The achievements of the Five-Year Plan were not only of decisive significance for the socialist construction of the Soviet Union and the consolidation of the power of the Soviet socialist state, but also of great international significance. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The success of the Five-Year Plan mobilized the revolutionary forces of the working class of all countries against capitalism, which is an indisputable fact." [4]
    During the years of the first Five-Year Plan, the face of the Soviet state changed beyond recognition. Stalin pointed out in his report that the industrial achievements "exceeded the expectations of even the most enthusiastic people in our Party" [5]. The ferrous metallurgy industry, the tractor manufacturing industry, the automobile manufacturing industry, the machine frame manufacturing industry, a major modern chemical industry, and agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, as well as the aviation industry, were created. In terms of power manufacturing, kerosene products, and coal production, the Soviet state rose from the bottom of the world to one of the top.
    Stalin said in his report: "We used to have only one coal and iron base in Ukraine, and even that base was not fully developed at the time. Now we have not only revitalized this base, but also created a new coal and iron base in the east that we can be proud of." [6] New textile industry bases were established in Central Asia and Western Siberia. The huge construction work of factories in the Kramatorsk and Gorky regions, as well as the Magnitogorsk metallurgical plant, the Ural machine factory, the Berezniki and Solikamsk chemical complexes, and the Dnieper hydroelectric power station were carried out.
    By the end of 1932, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union had increased by 219% compared to the 1928 level. During these years, when Soviet industry was soaring unprecedentedly, a routine economic crisis was developing in capitalist countries. During the same period, the total industrial output of the United States fell to 56%, Britain to 80%, and Germany to 55%. This illustrates the tremendous superiority of the Soviet industrial system over the capitalist industrial system. During these years, unemployment was eliminated in the Soviet Union, while the number of unemployed in capitalist countries increased to 30 to 40 million.
    The achievements of industrialization created the necessary preconditions for the socialist transformation of agriculture. The task of the first Five-Year Plan in agriculture was to transform the Soviet Union from a backward country of small farmers into "a country with large-scale agriculture, organized on the basis of collective labor, and capable of supplying the most commodity products." [7] By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the millions of scattered and small individual farmers of the past had been organized into more than 200,000 collective farms with highly developed modern agricultural equipment. About 5,000 Soviet farms with advanced agricultural technology for grain and animal husbandry were established. Within four years, the Soviet Union expanded its sown area by 21 million hectares, while in capitalist countries, the sown area continued to shrink and the total output of agricultural products continued to decline during the same period.
    Poverty has been completely eliminated in the Soviet countryside.
    The achievements of Stalin's Five-Year Plan were events of worldwide historical significance. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report: "As a result of the completion of the Five-Year Plan in industry, agriculture, and commerce, we have... laid down the socialist principle in all sectors of the national economy." [8] – The result of this victory was the elimination of human exploitation of man in the Soviet Union. Lenin and Stalin's great doctrine that socialism can triumph in a single country surrounded by capitalism has been brilliantly realized. The summary of the Five-Year Plan shows that the capitalist economic system is something with shaky and unstable foundations, which is in decline and should give way to another higher economic system, namely the Soviet socialist economic system.
    The victorious completion of the first Stalin Five-Year Plan encouraged the Soviet people to further carry out socialist construction, and it was the foundation for a stronger, new economic and cultural upsurge of the Soviet state. During the years of the second Stalin Five-Year Plan, a socialist society was built in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become a powerful industrial-collective farm power. In the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union against the Hitler aggressors and Japanese imperialism, the decisive superiority of the socialist social system and state system over the capitalist system was more powerfully demonstrated. The country's industrialization, especially the powerful industrial centers established in the east and Central Asia of the Soviet Union during the previous Five-Year Plans, played a huge role in ensuring the victory of the Soviet people over the fascist aggressors in the historically significant events of the world.
    In the post-war period, the Soviet people quickly healed the wounds of war and successfully completed the fourth Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In 1952, the level of industrial production in the Soviet Union had greatly exceeded that of various capitalist countries in Europe. Now the smelting of pig iron and steel in the Soviet Union has exceeded the total of Britain, France and Belgium, the mining of coal and the production of electricity have exceeded the total output of Britain and France, and the production of cotton fabrics and leather shoes is much more than the total of Britain and France. The output of beet sugar in the Soviet Union also greatly exceeded the total output of the United States, France, and Britain, and the output of wheat in the Soviet Union also exceeded that of the world's largest wheat-producing countries - the United States, Canada, and Argentina. In the Soviet Union, the welfare and cultural level of the people are growing year by year. The continuous growth of socialist production in the Soviet Union is determined by basic socialist economic laws, the main characteristic and requirement of which is: "To ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of high technology." [9]
    Based on the achievements of socialist construction, the great Lenin-Stalin Party put forward the practical task of building communism to the Soviet people. The great Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the various resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are of great significance for realizing this historically significant task. The Congress's instructions on the fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan determined that the Soviet state would further develop towards the road of communism, the road pointed out by the great Stalin in his brilliant works. The fifth Five-Year Plan foresees a new and powerful upsurge in all sectors of the national economy, and a further improvement in the material welfare and culture of workers, which shows the world the great vitality of socialism. The Soviet people are enthusiastically implementing Stalin's grand plan to transform nature, building various huge buildings of communism, and striving to victoriously complete the various tasks stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan. Under the invincible banner of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people are paving the road to communism, and fighting to consolidate the democratic and socialist camp and defend the peace and security of the people of all countries in the world.

    伟大的总结
    ——纪念斯大林“第一个五年计划底总结”发表二十周年
    苏联  阿·奥夫卡洛娃
    二十年以前，一九三三年一月七日，在苏联共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会联席全会上，斯大林同志作了关于第一个五年计划总结的有历史意义的报告。党的领袖对苏联人民在第一个五年计划期间（一九二八年——一九三二年）在国内政治、经济及文化生活方面所获得的巨大成绩，给予了深刻的科学的分析。
    一九二六年，苏联完成了在第一次世界大战、外国武装干涉和内战时期所遭受破坏的国民经济底恢复工作之后，便着手国家的社会主义工业化。五年计划的基本任务，斯大林同志指出，就是要把苏联由一个技术经济落后的农业国家，变成为“毫不依赖于世界资本主义意旨而完全独立的富强工业国家”〔一〕。
    恢复和发展重工业是实现这一巨大计划的基础。“因为只有重工业，才能把全部工业、运输业以及农业都改造过来，振兴起来。”〔二〕可是恢复和发展重工业需要巨大的基本建设和大量资金。在当时这样一个落后而不富裕的国家里，从哪里寻找这批必需的资金呢？
    斯大林同志在他的报告中指出：“规定极严格节省的办法，积蓄为资助我国工业化所必需的经费，——这就是我们为达到恢复重工业和实现五年计划目的所应走的道路。”〔三〕
    这曾是条困难的道路，但是苏联人民在列宁—斯大林党的鼓舞下胜利地克服了这种困难。第一个五年计划提前——四年零三个月——完成了。在这短短的时期内，苏联创建了社会主义经济的基础。列宁—斯大林党领导下的工人、农民及苏维埃知识分子的英勇劳动，保证了这一具有历史意义的胜利。在这些年份里，曾开展了劳动者的群众性的社会主义竞赛，这种竞赛后来变成为建设社会主义的共产主义方法。
    完成五年计划的成就不仅对于苏联的社会主义建设和巩固苏维埃社会主义国家的威力具有决定性的意义，它也具有巨大的国际意义。斯大林同志指出：“五年计划底成功动员世界各国工人阶级革命力量去反对资本主义，这是不容置辩的事实。”〔四〕
    在第一个五年计划的年份里，苏维埃国家的面貌已改变到不可认识的地步。斯大林在他的报告中指出：工业的成绩“超过了我们党内那些具有最热头脑的人所能期待的程度”〔五〕。创建了黑色金属冶炼业、拖拉机制造业、汽车制造业、机架制造业、重大的现代化学工业和农业机器制造业，以及航空工业。在电力制造业，煤油产品和煤炭出产量方面苏维埃国家已从世界最末位升到首位之一了。
    斯大林在他的报告中说道：“我们从前只是在乌克兰有一个煤铁根据地，而且我们当时就连这个根据地也没有把它充分布置好。而我们现在不仅振兴了这个根据地，并且在东部创造了我国所能引以自豪的一个新的煤铁根据地。”〔六〕在中亚细亚和西西伯利亚建立了新的纺织工业根据地。并曾开展了克拉马多尔和高尔基地区的工厂的巨大建设工作，以及马格尼托哥尔斯克的冶金工厂，乌拉尔的机器工厂、别列兹尼科夫和萨里卡姆的化学联合工厂，第聂伯河的水电站等。
    苏联工业出产总量在一九三二年末，已比一九二八年水平增加到了百分之二百一十九。在这些年份里，当苏联工业在空前高涨的时候，资本主义国家里却发展着例行的经济危机。在同时期内美国工业出产总量降到了百分之五十六，英国降到了百分之八十，德国降到了百分之五十五。这就说明了苏维埃工业制度对于资本主义工业制度的巨大优越性。在这些年份里，苏联境内已消灭了失业现象，而资本主义国家里的失业人数却增到三四千万人。
    工业化的成就为农业的社会主义改造创造了必要前提。第一个五年计划在农业方面的任务，就是要把苏联由小农的落后国家，变成为“拥有规模巨大，根据集体劳动组织起来而能供给最多商品产物的那种农业的国家”。〔七〕五年计划结束时，过去千百万零散的细小的个体农户，已组织成二十余万个拥有高度发展的现代农业装备的集体农庄。建立了约五千个拥有先进农业技术的谷物和养畜的苏维埃农庄。四年之内苏联把播种面积扩大了二千一百万公顷，而资本主义国家在同时期内播种面积却不断地缩小，农产品总产量不断降低。
    在苏维埃农村里已彻底消灭了贫困。
    斯大林五年计划的成就，是具有全世界历史意义的事件。斯大林同志在他的报告中指出：“由于五年计划在工业、农业以及商业方面完成的结果，我们在国民经济各部门中都已……奠定了社会主义原则。”〔八〕——这一胜利的结果，使苏联国内消灭了人剥削人的现象。列宁、斯大林关于在资本主义包围的情况下社会主义可能在单独一个国家获胜的伟大学说，已光辉地实现了。五年计划的总结表明资本主义经济体系是脚根动摇而不稳固的东西，它已在衰颓，而应该让位给别的更高的经济体系，即苏维埃的社会主义的经济体系。
    第一个斯大林五年计划的胜利完成，鼓舞了苏联人民进一步开展社会主义建设，它是苏维埃国家更强大的、新的经济和文化高涨的基础。在第二个斯大林五年计划的年份里，苏联已建成了社会主义社会。苏联已变成一个强大的工业—集体农庄的大国。在苏联反对希特勒侵略者及日本帝国主义的伟大卫国战争中，更加有力地表现出社会主义的社会制度和国家制度对资本主义制度的决定性的优越性。国家的工业化，特别是在前几个五年计划时期苏联东部及中亚细亚所建立的强大的工业中心，在保证苏联人民战胜法西斯侵略者的有全世界历史意义的事件中，起了巨大的作用。
    战后时期，苏联人民很快地医好了战争的创伤，并顺利地提前完成了第四个斯大林五年计划。一九五二年苏联的工业生产水平已大大超过了欧洲各资本主义国家的生产。现在苏联生铁和钢的冶炼已超过英国、法国和比利时三国的总和，煤的开采量和电力生产已超过英法二国产量的总和，棉织品和皮鞋的生产要比英法二国的总和多得多。苏联甜菜糖的产量也大大超过了美、法、英三国产量的总和，苏联小麦的产量也超过了世界上最大的产麦国——美国、加拿大和阿根廷。在苏联，人民的福利和文化水平在一年一年地增长着。苏联社会主义生产之不断增长，是由社会主义的基本经济法则决定的，这个法则的主要特点和要求便是：“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”〔九〕
    根据社会主义建设的成就，伟大的列宁—斯大林党向苏联人民提出了建设共产主义的实践任务。伟大的斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的各项决议，对实现这一有历史意义的任务具有极重大的意义。代表大会关于第五个斯大林五年计划的指示，决定苏维埃国家进一步向共产主义道路，向伟大的斯大林在其天才著作中所指示的道路发展。第五个五年计划预见到一切国民经济部门的新的强大的高涨，及劳动者物质福利和文化的进一步提高，它向全世界显示了社会主义的伟大生命力量。苏联人民正在热情地实现斯大林改造自然的宏伟计划，建设着共产主义的各种巨大建筑，争取胜利完成新五年计划所规定的各项任务。在列宁—斯大林党的不可战胜的旗帜下，苏联人民铺设着走向共产主义的大道，并为巩固民主与社会主义阵营及捍卫全世界各国人民的和平与安全而斗争。（以楠译）
