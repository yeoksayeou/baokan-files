Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 28th: Since the Chinese and Korean People's Armies launched large-scale propaganda work against the enemy forces, an increasing number of Li pseudo-army soldiers, beginning to awaken, have been surrendering to our army on the front lines.

From December 10th of last year to January 10th of this year, the number of Li pseudo-army soldiers who surrendered to our army on the western front was equal to two-thirds of the total number of Li pseudo-army soldiers who surrendered to our army in the same area from January to mid-November of last year. This phenomenon shows that the national awakening of South Korean soldiers is rapidly increasing.

Recently, the Li pseudo-army soldiers who have surrendered to our army include new recruits who have just been added to the combat troops, veterans who have been transferred from the second line, and even a few junior officers. Most of them carried weapons and "safe conduct passes" distributed by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies when they surrendered.

From the conversations with the surrendered Li pseudo-army soldiers, it can be seen that the main reasons for their surrender are the continuous victories of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the heavy casualties suffered by the US-Li forces. A soldier from the 1st Marine Regiment of the Li pseudo-army said: "When I was added to the 1st Battalion (营), 1st Company (连), 3rd Platoon (排) of the 1st Marine Regiment on October 4th (last year), this platoon had only eight people left. And it was still the unit with the fewest casualties in the entire battalion." Another soldier from the 1st Squad (班) of the 3rd Platoon of the 5th Company of the 15th Regiment of the 1st Division of the Li pseudo-army said: "Three of us were added to this squad at that time, but in less than twenty days, four more people in this squad were killed!" Therefore, Li pseudo-army soldiers and even officers wanted to avoid the ever-increasing threat of death as much as possible. According to a soldier who surrendered from the 9th Division of the Li pseudo-army, because our army defeated the US 7th Division and the pseudo-army 2nd Division, known as the "White Bone Unit," in the Battle of Shangganling, the officers and soldiers of the Li pseudo-army 9th Division, who were later transferred to this area, were very afraid, and some people injured themselves within ten days of going to the front line. Some soldiers despairingly said: "It seems that our lives are as short as flies!" Once, the company commander of a certain company of the Pseudo 9th Division ordered a platoon leader to take a unit to ambush. The platoon leader stopped the unit four or five li away from the designated location. He said to the soldiers: "Let's hide here, don't be so stupid, and give your lives away for nothing! When we go back, say whatever I say!"

The increasingly frenzied enslavement and trampling of the South Korean people by the US-Li gang also stimulated the rapid awakening of the national consciousness of South Korean soldiers. According to a surrendered soldier from the 5th Battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment of the Li pseudo-army, he was drafted into the army last May. Among the thirty-odd households in his family's village, eight households were arrested and beaten by the US-Li gang for failing to pay rice taxes, and finally they sold their only houses and cattle to pay the taxes. He said indignantly: "South Korea has now become a living hell, and the people's lives are more painful than under Japanese imperialism!" A squad leader of the 2nd Squad of the Reconnaissance Company of the 28th Regiment of the Pseudo 9th Division, who surrendered, said that he saw groups of out-of-school youths and children kneeling at the station in Seoul begging. On the night of October 14th last year, he also saw a Korean youth being beaten to death by two American soldiers on the streets of Seoul. These many things made him increasingly clear that "Syngman Rhee is selling out the motherland."

When winter came, these Li pseudo-army soldiers whose families were in South Korea naturally thought of the above situations and felt sad and shed tears when they were on guard in the cold and dark nights or huddled in cold bunkers.

In the Li pseudo-army, the soldiers' lives are extremely harsh. They eat cold rice balls and are subjected to abuse and beatings by officers. Some soldiers wearing torn American soldiers' clothes are cold when they are on guard at night, and they are often beaten by officers when they go to the bunker to warm up or find a cigarette butt to smoke. A surrendered soldier from the 15th Regiment of the 1st Division of the Li pseudo-army said that he was beaten four times by Li pseudo-army officers in just twenty days on the front line.

When the Li pseudo-army soldiers were in extreme pessimism and despair, the propaganda work of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies illuminated a path for them to avoid death and move towards a new life. From our army's frontline broadcasts, shouts, and distributed propaganda materials, they more clearly saw through the deception of the US-Li gang, understood the humanitarian prisoner policy of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and after repeated consideration, successively chose the path of surrender.

Among the many surrendered soldiers, some people accelerated their surrender because they knew that the American aggressors were going to further expand the war. An ordinary seaman from the 2nd Company of the 5th Battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment of the Li pseudo-army, when he heard the squad leader say that their unit would be transferred to an island outside Incheon Port for landing training in preparation for amphibious landing operations in the future, he thought: "Saving my life is the most important thing. I haven't been killed here, but don't die in the sea!" He made his final decision and ran to our army's position to surrender two days before the Pseudo Marine 1st Regiment left the front line. He said: "I figured that I would die over there (referring to the Li pseudo-army) anyway, and if I come here, I can go home and live a peaceful life in the future."

Now, all the surrendered Li pseudo-army soldiers have been treated with leniency and good care in life by our army. They ask our army to specifically tell the Li pseudo-army soldiers who are still living a hellish life in South Korea about the lenient treatment of surrendered soldiers.

### 朝鲜前线向我投诚的李伪军士兵逐渐增多

    朝鲜前线向我投诚的李伪军士兵逐渐增多
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】中朝人民军队对敌军展开大规模宣传工作以后，开始觉醒的李伪军士兵，在前线向我军投诚的事情已逐渐增多起来。
    去年十二月十日到今年一月十日，向西线我军投诚的李伪军士兵的数目，等于去年一月到十一月中李伪军士兵在同一地区向我军投诚的总数的三分之二。这一现象说明南朝鲜士兵的民族觉醒正在迅速增长中。
    最近向我军投诚的李伪军士兵，有的是刚被补入作战部队的新兵，有的是从第二线调上来的老兵，甚至还有个别的下级军官。他们在投诚时大部分都携带着武器和朝中人民军队散发的“安全证”。
    从投诚的李伪军士兵的谈话中可以看出，促使他们投诚的主要原因是朝中人民军队不断的胜利和美李军不断遭到的惨重的伤亡。一个李伪军海军陆战第一团的士兵说：“我在十月四日（去年）补入陆一团一大队（营）一中队（连）三小队（排）时，这个小队已经打得只剩下八个人了。而它还是全大队中伤亡最少的单位。”另一个李伪军第一师第十五联队五中队三小队一分队（班）的士兵说：“我们那次共有三个人补入这个分队，但不到二十天，这个分队又有四个人被打死了！”因此，李伪军士兵以至军官们都想尽量避免愈来愈大的死亡威胁。据李伪军第九师投诚的士兵说，由于我军在上甘岭战役中把美军第七师和被称为“白骨部队”的伪军第二师打得落花流水，使以后调到这一地区的李伪军第九师的官兵们都很害怕，上阵地不到十天就有人自伤。有的士兵就绝望地说：“看来我们的生命就像苍蝇一样活不长了！”有一次，伪九师某连连长命令一个排长带一支部队去打伏击。这个排长把部队带到离指定位置还有四五里的地方就停了下来。他对士兵们说：“就在这里躲一躲吧，不要那么傻，拿性命去白送死！回去时，我怎么说你们也怎么说吧！”
    美李匪帮对南朝鲜人民日益疯狂的奴役和蹂躏，也刺激了南朝鲜士兵民族意识的迅速觉醒。据李伪军海军陆战第一团五大队的一个投诚的士兵说，他是去年五月被抓当兵的，他家庭所在的村子共有三十多户人家，其中就有八户因没有米纳税被美李匪帮抓去毒打，最后还是卖掉了仅有的房屋和耕牛来纳税。他悲愤地说：“南朝鲜如今已经变成了一座人间地狱，人民的生活比日本帝国主义统治的时候还痛苦！”投诚的伪九师二十八联队搜索中队二小队的一个小队长说，他在汉城看到成群的失学青年和儿童跪在车站上求乞。去年十月十四日夜里，他还在汉城街上看见一个朝鲜青年被两个美国兵活活打死。这许多事情使他愈来愈清楚地认识到“李承晚是在出卖祖国”。
    当冬季降临以后，这些家在南朝鲜的李伪军士兵在严寒漆黑的夜里站岗或蜷缩在寒冷的地堡中时，都自然地想到以上种种情形而悲伤、流泪。
    在李伪军中，士兵们的生活极为恶劣。他们吃着冰冷的饭团，受着军官们的虐待和打骂。有的士兵穿着美国兵的破衣服在夜里站岗时冷得难受，到地堡里去烤烤火或找个烟头吸，也常遭到军官的毒打。一个投诚的李伪军第一师十五联队的士兵说，他到阵地上只二十天就挨了李伪军军官的四次毒打。
    当李伪军士兵处于极端悲观、绝望中时，朝中人民军队的宣传工作为他们照亮了一条避免死亡走向新的生活的道路。他们从我军的火线广播、喊话、散发的宣传品中更清楚地识破了美李匪帮对他们的欺骗，了解了朝中人民军队人道主义的俘虏政策，经过反复思量就陆续选择了投诚的道路。
    在许多投诚的士兵中，有些人还是因为知道美国侵略者要进一步扩大战争而加速采取了投诚的行动。李伪军海军陆战第一团五大队二中队的一个一等水兵，在听到班长说他们这支部队将要调到仁川港外的一个岛上去受登陆训练，准备将来进行两栖登陆作战时，他就想：“保命是最重要的。我在这里没有被打死，可不要死到海里！”他便下了最后的决心，在伪陆战一团调离前线的前两天跑到我军阵地上来投诚了。他说：“我算来算去在那边（指李伪军）怎样也要死，到这边来将来就可以回家过和平生活。”
    现在，所有李伪军投诚的士兵，都受到了我军的宽待和生活上的良好照顾。他们要求我军把宽待投诚士兵的情形具体地告诉还在南朝鲜过着地狱般生活的李伪军士兵们。
