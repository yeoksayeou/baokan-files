Northwest Petroleum Administration
Fully Utilizes Inventory Equipment
Basic Construction Equipment Procurement Plan Reduced by Half

    The Northwest Petroleum Administration is actively carrying out internal material balancing work, making full use of a large amount of stagnant and reserve inventory equipment, reducing the planned figures for this year's basic construction equipment procurement by 50%.
    In the past, various units under the Northwest Petroleum Administration had large procurement plans, resulting in a lot of stockpiled equipment. For example, the Yumen Mining Bureau requested more than 5,200 kilograms of silicomanganese in 1951, but only actually used 1,500 kilograms. In order to make full use of this equipment, in July 1952, the Northwest Petroleum Administration instructed all its subordinate units to thoroughly clean up their warehouses and carry out "asset verification and review" and a "material turnaround." All warehouses were cleaned up and rectified for more than 100 days, and more than 30,000 kinds of equipment of varying sizes and values were sorted out, unifying the names and specifications of various equipment. All off-book materials were registered and accounted for. For example, the total value of off-book materials collected by the Yumen Mining Bureau reached more than 13 billion yuan. Based on the results of the inventory, each unit accurately prepared the 1953 material supply plan. Inventory materials that can be used by the unit are used as much as possible, and those that cannot be used by the unit are adjusted between units to make up for shortages.
    In mid-December of last year, the Northwest Petroleum Administration held a material balancing meeting. At the meeting, the material supply personnel of various basic construction grassroots units carried out balancing work item by item for general equipment and foreign equipment. For general materials, the "card calling" method was adopted at the meeting. That is, the unit with accumulated stagnant materials wrote the name, quantity, and specifications of each material on a specially made card and read out the description on the card to everyone at the meeting; the unit that needs the material can propose the required quantity of a certain material based on the card description. For example, a warehouse accumulated four DC welding machines. After "calling the card," they were requested by four basic construction units, which saved 400 million yuan in equipment procurement costs. For the accumulated foreign equipment, the "card making" method was adopted. That is, the unit that needs to order foreign equipment fills out a material request card, indicating in detail on the card the monthly demand and the required time, and then the Northwest Petroleum Administration adjusts according to the principle of "taking care of the new areas"; in this way, many of the materials that various basic construction units originally needed to purchase from abroad can be solved from the inventory materials, of which the adjusted oil well casing alone is worth more than 26 billion yuan.

### 西北石油管理局  充分利用库存器材  基本建设器材采购计划缩减一半

    西北石油管理局
    充分利用库存器材
    基本建设器材采购计划缩减一半
    西北石油管理局积极进行内部物资平衡工作，充分利用大量的库存呆滞器材和储备器材，使今年的基本建设器材采购的计划数字缩小了百分之五十。
    西北石油管理局所属各单位过去由于请购计划庞大，积压的器材很多，如玉门矿务局一九五一年请购矽铁五千二百多公斤，实际只用了一千五百公斤。为了使这些器材得到充分利用，一九五二年七月份，西北石油管理局就指示所属各单位彻底清理仓库，进行“核资复查”和“器材大翻身”。所有仓库经过一百多天的清查整顿，把三万多种大小、贵贱不等的器材清理出来，统一了各种器材的名称、规模，所有帐外材料全部登记归帐，如玉门矿务局搜集的帐外材料总值就达一百三十余亿元。根据清仓结果，各单位准确地编制了一九五三年的材料供应计划。库存材料凡本单位能够利用的尽量利用，本单位利用不上的就在各单位之间互相调剂有无。
    西北石油管理局在去年十二月中旬举行了物资平衡会议，会上各基本建设基层单位的材料供应人员，分别对一般器材和国外器材逐项进行了平衡工作。对于一般材料，会上采用了“唱卡”的办法，就是由积存呆滞材料的单位，把每项材料的名称、数量、规格，分别写在特制的卡片上，在会上向大家逐项唱出卡片上的说明；需用材料的单位就可以根据卡片说明，提出对某种器材的需要量。如某库积压了四部直流电焊机，“唱卡”后，被四个基本建设单位要去，这样就可节省四亿元的器材采购费。对于积存的国外器材，则采用“制卡”的办法，就是由需要订购国外器材的单位填制需料卡片，在卡片上详细注明该单位每月需要量和需要时间，然后由西北石油管理局按照“照顾新地区”的原则进行调剂；这样各基本建设单位原来需要向国外采购的材料，很多都可从库存材料中解决，其中调剂的油井套管一项就值二百六十多亿元。（新华社）
