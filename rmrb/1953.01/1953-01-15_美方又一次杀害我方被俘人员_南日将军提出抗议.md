    The US Side Murdered Our Captured Personnel Again
    General Nam Il Lodged a Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong] According to the US side's announcement: on January 9th, at the Shangwutai POW camp on the Korean Peninsula, and on January 12th, at the Moseulpo POW camp on Jeju Island, one POW in each camp "hanged himself." Since August of last year, the US side has frequently announced that POWs have "hanged themselves." In order to cover up the crime of murdering POWs, the US side falsely claimed that these two POWs were both "anti-communist" and "unwilling to be repatriated." However, they did not mention a word about why they "committed suicide" in the US POW camps, which are heavily controlled by US, Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, nor could they announce it, nor did they dare to announce it. As everyone knows, the US side stubbornly claims that the POWs "would rather commit suicide than go home," but in fact, the US side is forcibly transferring them to the Rhee Syngman gang to serve as cannon fodder by means of slaughter. Obviously, the so-called POW "hanging themselves" is an excuse for the US side to cover up this heinous crime.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 14th] On January 9th, the US side killed another captured member of our side in the Shangwutai POW camp. General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the other side on January 14th, pointing out that the US side cannot escape full responsibility for the war crime of massacring prisoners of war.

### 美方又一次杀害我方被俘人员  南日将军提出抗议

    美方又一次杀害我方被俘人员
    南日将军提出抗议
    【新华社开城讯】据美方宣布：一月九日在朝鲜大陆上的尚武台战俘营内，一月十二日在济州岛上的摹瑟浦战俘营内，又各有一名战俘“上吊自杀”。美方自去年八月以来，经常都宣布有战俘“上吊自杀”。美方为了掩饰谋害战俘的罪行，谎称这两个战俘都是“反共”和“不愿意遣返”的战俘。但是他们为何竟在为美李蒋特务层层控制的美方战俘营内“自杀”，美方照例一字不提，其实也无法宣布、不敢宣布。大家知道，美方硬说战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”，而事实上美方却在用屠杀手段强迫把他们移交李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。显然所谓战俘 “上吊自杀”，乃是美方掩盖这一罪恶行为的借口。
    【新华社开城十四日电】一月九日美方在尚武台战俘营中又害死我方被俘人员一名。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在一月十四日向对方提出严重抗议。指出美方决不能逃脱屠杀战俘的战争罪行的完全责任。
