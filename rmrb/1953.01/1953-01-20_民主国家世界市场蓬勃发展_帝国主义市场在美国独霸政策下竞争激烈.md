Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Moscow (TASS): The "Labor News" on the 17th published an article by En. Ivanov entitled "Fraternal Friendship and Mutual Assistance Among Democratic Countries". Ivanov wrote: Under the capitalist system, monopoly capital uses foreign trade as a means to obtain extra profits through unequal exchange. Imperialists use trade to intensify the exploitation of the people of other countries, further enslave dependent countries, carry out economic aggression, and engage in fierce competition for markets, sources of raw materials, and investment opportunities. In contrast, the relations established within the democratic countries' world market are based on the fraternal friendship and cooperation among the people of free countries, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, genuine equality between large and small countries, respect for national sovereignty, and a sincere desire for mutual assistance to achieve common economic development. The new world market does not feel the difficulties of sales, because with the continuous increase in civilian production, sales are also increasing day by day. In the past four years alone, the total volume of foreign trade among the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp has more than doubled. In the first nine months of last year, trade among the European People's Democratic countries increased by 24 percent compared with the same period in 1951.

The author said that the total volume of the Soviet Union's foreign trade is currently three times that of pre-war levels. The foreign trade of the capitalist world has never had and cannot have such rapid development. The Soviet Union occupies the first place in the foreign trade of the People's Republic of China and the democratic camp countries in Europe and elsewhere. In 1952, 80 percent of the Soviet Union's foreign trade was conducted with the People's Democratic countries. The author pointed out that trade with the Soviet Union is of great significance in the economic construction of the People's Democratic countries.

The author provided a table illustrating the rapid development of foreign trade in the People's Democratic countries. The total volume of imports and exports of the five European People's Democratic countries, namely Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, has increased more than seven times in the post-war period.

Ivanov emphasized that trade between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union is based on equality and mutual benefit, and the quantity and scale of trade are constantly expanding. Before World War II, Hungary and Albania had no trade with the Soviet Union at all. In 1951, their trade with the Soviet Union accounted for 57 percent and 29 percent of their total foreign trade, respectively. Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania's trade with the Soviet Union accounted for only a weak 0.1 percent of their total foreign trade in 1938, but increased to 58 percent, 25 percent, and 51 percent, respectively, in 1951. Last year, trade with the Soviet Union accounted for 28 percent of Czechoslovakia's total import and export volume. The goods exported by the Soviet Union to the People's Democratic countries are mainly those needed by these countries to implement their economic plans. As for the People's Democratic countries, they transport various manufactured goods, raw materials, and grains to the Soviet Union.

Ivanov wrote: With the expansion of economic ties with the Soviet Union, the trade volume between the People's Democratic countries is also constantly increasing. In 1951 alone, trade between Poland and other fraternal countries increased by 32 percent. Recently, economic exchanges between the European People's Democratic countries and China and the German Democratic Republic have also greatly expanded. Last year, the German Democratic Republic's trade with Hungary doubled, trade with Romania tripled, and trade with the People's Republic of China almost quadrupled.

The author also said that the countries of the democratic camp also strive to develop trade with capitalist countries. However, this desire has encountered economic blockades implemented by many capitalist countries under the pressure of the US aggressive bloc. But this policy of capitalist countries cannot stop the economic development of the democratic camp countries. On the contrary, it helps to strengthen the new market.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Moscow (TASS), 15th: Filipov wrote an article in "Pravda" discussing the expansion of the United States in the capitalist world market.

Filipov wrote: Since the end of World War II, US monopoly capital has greatly strengthened its offensive in the capitalist world market. They are driving other countries, especially their main competitor Britain, out of the capitalist world market in order to expand. By the end of 1951, the value of US exports was almost twice that of British exports. The United States has to a considerable extent driven British exporters out of the Latin American market, and even out of the internal market of the British Empire. US capital has consolidated its position in the Western European market. US exports to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the African territories of Britain, France, and other European countries have also increased significantly.

The United States is doing everything possible to monopolize trade in various regions in order to manipulate prices. The price at which US monopoly capital purchases grain and raw materials in backward countries is far below the world market price. At the same time, the United States forces countries that depend on it to buy American goods at high prices.

US monopoly capital is increasing capital exports year by year under the guise of providing "selfless assistance" and eliminating the "dollar shortage" to backward countries. Although the total amount of US private investment overseas has almost doubled in the past nine years, now reaching 14 billion US dollars, the current rate of capital export still cannot satisfy the desires of US financial and business groups. Recently, US government agencies and banker and manufacturer organizations have launched a very fierce campaign to increase the export of US private capital overseas.

Filipov continued, US monopoly capital is doing its best to increase its own exports, while also protecting the US domestic market to prevent the intrusion of foreign imports.

The long-term serious disorder of foreign trade and finance in Britain, France, Italy, and other Western European countries is a direct result of their rulers supporting the aggressive policies of US monopolists in violation of their own national interests. The struggle between the United States and other capitalist countries for markets and investment opportunities is becoming increasingly acute. Commercial wars between capitalist countries are becoming increasingly widespread and fierce.

Filipov pointed out: The capitalist countries' frenzied arms expansion movement will eventually reduce foreign trade in the capitalist world. In 1952, the trade volume of the capitalist world market decreased month by month. Figures released by the US Department of Commerce show that the export value of civilian goods fell from an annual rate of 16 billion US dollars in the first quarter of last year to 11 billion US dollars in the third quarter of last year. The foreign trade volume of cotton, wheat, textiles, chemicals, automobiles, hardware, and industrial equipment has been greatly reduced.

Filipov wrote: It should be pointed out that although the United States has controlled a large part of capitalist trade since the end of World War II, it has not been able to dominate the world market, and there is no reason to believe that it will be able to do so in the future. The struggle of Britain against the US control of world trade is intensifying every moment.

The contradictions between the United States and West Germany, and between the United States and Japan, in the capitalist world market are also becoming increasingly prominent.

Filipov concluded: The facts show that the more the United States intensifies its expansion in the capitalist world market, the deeper the contradictions between the United States and other capitalist countries become, and the more acute their struggles become.

    民主国家世界市场蓬勃发展
    帝国主义市场在美国独霸政策下竞争激烈
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报十七日刊载了恩·伊凡诺夫的题为“民主国家之间兄弟般的友好和互助”的文章。伊凡诺夫写道：在资本主义制度下，垄断资本用对外贸易作为通过不等价交换来谋取额外利润的手段。帝国主义者利用贸易来加紧对其他国家人民的剥削，更加厉害地奴役附属国，实行经济侵略并进行争夺市场、原料来源和投资范围的剧烈竞争。而民主国家世界市场内所建立的关系则恰恰相反，它是建立在自由国家人民之间兄弟般的友好与合作的基础上的，它所根据的原则是：无产阶级的国际主义，大小国家的真正平等，尊重国家主权以及彼此互助以谋取共同的经济发展的真诚愿望。新的世界市场感受不到销售的困难，因为随着民用生产的不断增加，销售量也日益增大。仅只在过去四年中，和平民主阵营各国之间的对外贸易总额就增加了两倍多。在去年头九个月中，欧洲各人民民主国家之间的贸易比一九五一年同时期中增加了百分之二十四。
    作者说，目前苏联的对外贸易总额为战前的三倍。资本主义世界的对外贸易从来没有也不可能有这样迅速的发展。在中华人民共和国和欧洲及其他地方的民主阵营国家的对外贸易中，苏联占着首位。在一九五二年，苏联对外贸易中有百分之八十是和人民民主国家进行的。作者指出，在人民民主国家的经济建设中，对苏贸易具有十分重大的意义。
    作者列出一个表格，说明人民民主国家的对外贸易正在飞速发展。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚五个欧洲人民民主国家的进出口总额在战后时期中已增加七倍以上。
    伊凡诺夫强调说，人民民主国家和苏联之间的贸易是建立在平等互利的基础上的，贸易的数量和规模在不断扩大。在第二次世界大战前，匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚根本没有与苏联进行贸易。在一九五一年，它们与苏联的贸易已分别占对外贸易总额的百分之五十七和百分之二十九。波兰、保加利亚和罗马尼亚对苏联的贸易在一九三八年只占对外贸易总额的百分之零点一弱，在一九五一年已分别增为百分之五十八、百分之二十五和百分之五十一。去年，对苏贸易已占捷克斯洛伐克进出口总额的百分之二十八。苏联向人民民主国家输出的物品主要是这些国家执行经济计划所需要的物品。至于人民民主国家，它们则以各种制成品、原料和粮食运往苏联。
    伊凡诺夫写道：随着与苏联的经济联系的扩大，人民民主国家之间的贸易额也在不断增加。单在一九五一年，波兰和其他兄弟国家之间的贸易就增加了百分之三十二。最近，欧洲人民民主国家及中国和德意志民主共和国之间的经济交流也大大地扩大了。去年，德意志民主共和国对匈牙利的贸易增为两倍，对罗马尼亚的贸易增为三倍，对中华人民共和国的贸易差不多增为四倍。
    作者又说，民主阵营国家也力求发展对资本主义国家的贸易。然而这个愿望却碰到了许多资本主义国家在美国侵略集团的压力下实行的经济封锁。但是资本主义国家的这种政策不能阻止民主阵营国家的经济发展。它反而帮助加强了新的市场。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：费利波夫在“真理报”上撰文，论述美国在资本主义世界市场上进行扩张。
    费利波夫写道：自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美国垄断资本就大大加强了它们在资本主义世界市场上的攻势。它们正在把其他国家，首先是它们的主要竞争者英国，由资本主义世界市场上赶出去，以便进行扩张。到一九五一年年底，美国出口货的价值几乎为英国出口货的两倍。美国已在相当大的程度上把英国出口商从拉丁美洲市场上，甚至从英帝国内部的市场上驱逐出去。美国资本已经巩固了它在西欧市场的地位。美国对中近东、东南亚以及英国、法国和其他欧洲国家的非洲领地的输出量也有显著的增加。
    美国千方百计地垄断各地的贸易，以便能够操纵价格。美国垄断资本在落后国家购买粮食与原料的价钱远远低于世界市场价格。同时，美国强迫依赖它的国家以高价购买美国货。
    美国垄断资本正在对落后国家进行“无私的援助”和消灭“美元荒”的掩饰下逐年增加资本输出。虽然在过去九年内美国在海外的私人投资总数几乎增加了一倍，现在已达到一百四十亿美元，但是目前资本输出的速度仍不能满足美国金融与企业集团的欲望。最近，美国政府机关和银行家与制造商组织发动了一个非常猛烈的运动来增加美国私人资本向海外的输出。
    费利波夫接着说，美国垄断资本一方面尽力增加它们自己的输出，同时又保护美国国内市场，防止外国入口货的侵入。
    英国、法国、意大利及其他西欧国家的对外贸易与财政的长期严重紊乱状态，是它们的统治者违反着他们本国民族利益支持美国垄断资本家的侵略政策的直接结果。美国及其他资本主义国家争夺市场与投资范围的斗争日益尖锐。资本主义国家间的商业战正日益广泛、日益激烈。
    费利波夫指出：资本主义国家的疯狂扩张军备运动最后要使资本主义世界的对外贸易减少。一九五二年，资本主义世界市场的贸易量逐月降低。美国商务部公布的数字说明：民用货物的出口价值由去年第一季的年率一百六十亿美元跌到去年第三季的一百一十亿美元。棉花、小麦、纺织品、化学品、汽车、五金和工业装备的对外贸易量大大降低。
    费利波夫写道：应该指出，虽然美国自从第二次世界大战结束以来控制了一大部分资本主义贸易，但它没有能够统治世界市场，也没有理由相信它将来能够做到这一点。英国反对美国控制世界贸易的斗争每一时每一刻都在尖锐化。
    美国和西德，美国和日本之间在资本主义世界市场上的矛盾也日益显著。
    费利波夫最后说：事实说明，美国越加紧它在资本主义世界市场的扩张，美国和其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾也就越深，它们之间的斗争也就越尖锐。
