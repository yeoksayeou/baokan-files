    The members of the Soviet Film Artists Delegation, Chirkov, Ladynina, and Cherkasov, wrote a reply to the Chinese audiences who wrote to them during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" when they arrived in Manchuria by train. The letter is as follows:

    Dear audience comrades:

    We are very sorry that we were unable to answer your letters, and we didn't have time to do so! Our busy work schedule prevented us from doing so in a timely manner.

    Now, we are giving you a general reply, thanking you for your blessings, and thanking you for your friendship and love towards us and the characters we play. We know that this love expresses the sincere feelings of the Chinese people towards the Soviet people, and the Chinese people hope to advance along the revolutionary path that their neighbors have taken.

    We actors are very happy to realize that our work is helping to consolidate the friendship and alliance between our two countries.

    In our future work, we will definitely remember that we are working not only for Soviet audiences, but also for Chinese audiences.

    Dear friends, from the bottom of our hearts, we wish you and all the Chinese people happiness and success in the great work of building a new life.

    With deep respect,

    Soviet film actors, People's Artists of the Soviet Union

    Chirkov Ladynina Cherkasov
