Introducing "Imperialism and Chinese Politics"
　　By Dai Wenbao
　　Published by People's Publishing House, written by Hu Sheng

The book "Imperialism and Chinese Politics" was originally published by Sanlian Bookstore in 1948. The first edition after liberation was published in Beijing in 1949. Last year, the author made some necessary revisions, and the People's Publishing House re-released it.

The subject of this book is the political relationship between the imperialist powers and semi-colonial China. This is one of the basic questions in modern Chinese political history and revolutionary history. Chairman Mao once pointed out in "On New Democracy": "The history of imperialism's aggression against China, opposition to China's independence, and opposition to China's development of capitalism is the history of modern China. The failures of the Chinese revolution have always been strangled by imperialism." Under this theme, the book, through specific historical facts, profoundly analyzes how international imperialists carried out political aggression against China in the eighty-five years from the Opium War to the eve of the First Revolutionary Civil War, "how they encountered different treatment from China's reactionary rulers and the Chinese people," and explained "how all political reformists' illusions about imperialists harmed the Chinese people's revolutionary cause," thereby clarifying the political relationship between imperialist powers, especially U.S. imperialism, and semi-colonial China.

The Opium War was the starting point of imperialist oppression of the Chinese nation. The book's discussion begins here, first analyzing the political relationship between capitalist countries and China in the twenty years before and after the First and Second Opium Wars. After the Treaties of Tianjin and Beijing, foreign aggressors and the Manchu government established a relationship of mutual trust, and finally formed a military cooperation to strangle the Chinese people's revolution. The book points out: "Based on the experience of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, the powers began to realize that in order to control China and extract from the Chinese people, it is better to retain and support the current dynasty than to overthrow it casually." "On the part of the Manchu government, its policy of appeasement and compromise towards foreign aggressors, and its insistence on military suppression of the people, was no longer subject to any wavering." The history from 1840 to 1864 shows that the combination of imperialism and feudal forces became the two mountains weighing on the Chinese people. Since then, imperialism has gradually established control over the Manchu government. At the same time, China also produced a group of relatively "new" bureaucrats, such as Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang, who sought help from foreign troops to suppress the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. They wanted to maintain the old rule with the superficialities of Westernization, fulfilling the task of opening the way for the invaders. Therefore, the book points out: "The economic aggression of imperialism destroyed China's feudal economy, thus inevitably leading to the emergence of capitalist factors in China; but imperialism does not want China's capitalism to develop normally. Imperialists also demand that China be ruled by a government that is extremely weak and incompetent externally, but strong enough internally to 'maintain order,' so that China can never become an independent country. Li Hongzhang's 'Westernization Movement' precisely conformed to the demands of imperialism, and was therefore sponsored by imperialism."

The outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, although momentarily shaken the imperialists, but they immediately saw the naivety and deceptiveness of the leaders of the Chinese revolution and the revolutionary people at that time, cunningly decided to launch a counterattack against the Chinese people; they found Yuan Shikai as their tool to rule China, and supported him until Yuan Shikai climbed onto the throne of emperor. "The United States, Japan, Britain, and Germany all encouraged and encouraged Yuan Shikai to establish a dictatorship and even restore the imperial system, which is an undeniable fact." After Yuan Shikai's death, the imperialist countries each sought their powerful tools to compete for hegemony. The Beiyang warlord system split into the "Zhili" and "Anhui" factions after Yuan's death. The "Zhili" warlords Feng Guozhang, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, etc. were precisely the tools used by American and British imperialism; the "Anhui" warlord Duan Qirui and the "Fengtian" warlord Zhang Zuolin were the darlings of Japanese imperialism. The book points out: After the Washington Conference, the struggle for hegemony among the imperialist powers in China was reflected in the frequent and endless civil wars of various warlord factions. The agents of imperialism, whether Japanese or American and British, were equally guilty of selling out their country for personal gain, creating civil war, and harming the people. Through the discussion of the three historical periods of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Xinhai Revolution, and the eve of the First Revolutionary Civil War, the book sharply points out that the consistent stance of the imperialists in these three periods was to support counter-revolutionary forces, undermine the Chinese revolution, and obstruct China's progress. Among the international imperialists, U.S. imperialists are particularly vicious and cunning.

On the issue of the relationship between China and imperialist countries, some people often have many erroneous ideas, fantasizing about seeking support from the blood-stained imperialists - this is precisely the tragedy of the Hundred Days' Reform and similar political movements thereafter. In settling accounts with the eighty-five years of history before the First Revolutionary Civil War, this book analyzes the origin and harmfulness of this naive fantasy, for example, the reformers "thought that they could realize capitalist reforms and solve China's independence problem incidentally by using reformist methods without directly opposing imperialism." But imperialism used this fantasy as a lightning rod to prevent the people's revolution. There is no reformist future in China. "The purpose of the imperialist powers invading China is definitely not to turn feudal China into capitalist China. The purpose of the imperialist powers is the opposite, they want to turn China into their semi-colony and colony." (Mao Zedong: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") Therefore, the book points out that the reformers' idea of ​​realizing capitalist reform without striving for national independence is doomed to failure, and the leaders of the Xinhai Revolution, due to their illusions about imperialism, adopted a conciliatory and compromising attitude towards Yuan Shikai, which inevitably led to failure. The book thus draws an extremely beneficial conclusion: Any illusion about imperialism and its selected agents will cause serious damage to the cause of people's liberation!

The people do not fantasize about the support of imperialism, nor do they rely on the "recognition" of imperialism. Chairman Mao said in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "The process of the combination of imperialism and Chinese feudalism to turn China into a semi-colony and colony is also the process of the Chinese people resisting imperialism and its running dogs." The book initially singled out these two clues that run through modern history: "When the Manchu government first signed a treaty of national betrayal, it was also the beginning of the Chinese people engaging in patriotic struggles against foreign bourgeois aggressors." Therefore, the book not only discusses the painful history of China being invaded by imperialism, and the deformed political relations formed thereby, but also analyzes how this painful history and deformed political relations were changed by the revolutionary practice of the Chinese people. When analyzing how the Chinese people treat the imperialist aggressors, the book always cherishes the revolutionary achievements made by the people in various historical periods, and criticizes the fallacies of some bourgeois writers on modern history. But it does not shy away from some cognitive and action errors of the people in the struggle. It makes specific analyses historically according to the level of people's awareness, the ways of struggle that can be adopted, and the increasingly pressing situation of imperialist aggression, and crushes the arguments of those who point fingers as "onlookers".

In the new version, in addition to correcting some errors in historical materials and inappropriate wording, the author has made some supplementary explanations on the relationship between imperialist aggressive forces and feudal forces after 1864, on the relationship between the Hundred Days' Reform and imperialist forces, and on the relationship between Yuan Shikai and the entire European bourgeoisie. Some additions have also been made to the changes in domestic and international conditions before the May Fourth Movement, the changes in class relations and ideological trends in Chinese society, and the historical significance of the May Fourth Movement. What is especially important is the addition of the section "The Anti-Imperialist Battle Flag", which discusses the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and the great historical significance of the declaration of its Second National Congress. The declaration of this congress unprecedentedly clearly analyzed the situation of the Chinese state to the Chinese people, and for the first time linked China's democratic problem and national independence problem together in front of the Chinese people, and unfolded the broad prospects of the revolutionary movement. Adding this section is extremely necessary, because from then on, the deeply suffering Chinese people, in the struggle against powerful imperialism and all its running dogs in China, had the most reliable leader.

It should be pointed out that this book still has some shortcomings. The main thing is the lack of analysis of China's modern economic conditions. For example, the reason why the Manchu government initially adopted a policy of closing the country to the outside world in foreign relations was not explained from the self-sufficient economic foundation that supported this policy at that time; the economic reasons for the internal struggles of various warlord factions in China after the first year of the Republic of China, that is, the local agricultural economy (not a unified capitalist economy) and the policy of imperialist division of spheres of influence, are also lacking in explanation. Secondly, the analysis of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle is also not enough. In particular, the general outline of the development of modern Chinese revolutionary thought is not clear enough, making the mainstream of revolutionary thought in modern history not prominent enough. In addition, quotations are occasionally omitted, and some reference book titles in the footnotes are not in their original names, making it difficult to check.

In short, this book systematically demonstrates the theme of modern Chinese history pointed out by Chairman Mao in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy", and is a better one among the current modern history works. Today, opposing imperialism is still our serious task. The new version of this book can be used as an auxiliary reading material for studying modern Chinese history, and it will help us to arm ourselves ideologically and carry out the struggle against imperialism more bravely.

    介绍“帝国主义与中国政治”
  　戴文葆
    胡绳著人民出版社出版
    “帝国主义与中国政治”一书，原在一九四八年由三联书店出版，一九四九年在北京刊行解放后的第一版，去年又经作者做了一些必要的修改，由人民出版社重新出书。
    本书所写的对象是：帝国主义列强与半殖民地中国之间的政治关系。这是近代中国政治史和革命史中的若干基本问题之一。毛主席在“新民主主义论”中曾经指出：“帝国主义侵略中国，反对中国独立，反对中国发展资本主义的历史，就是中国的近代史。历来中国革命的失败，都是被帝国主义绞杀的”。就在这个主题下，本书通过具体的历史事实，深刻地分析了从鸦片战争到第一次国内革命战争前夜的八十五年间，国际帝国主义者怎样从政治上来对中国进行侵略，“他们从中国的反动统治者与中国人民中遇到了怎样不同的待遇”，并且说明“一切政治改良主义者对于帝国主义者的幻想曾怎样地损害了中国人民的革命事业”，从而清理了帝国主义列强，特别是美帝国主义与半殖民地中国的政治关系。
    鸦片战争是帝国主义对中国民族压迫的起点，本书的讨论就从这里开始，首先分析了第一次和第二次鸦片战争前后二十年间资本主义国家与中国之间的政治关系。经过天津条约和北京条约，外国侵略者与满清政府建立了相互信托的关系，并在最后形成了绞杀中国人民革命的军事合作。本书指出：“列强根据太平天国大革命的经验开始发觉：为了控制中国和榨取中国人民，是宁愿保留和支持现在这个皇朝，而绝不能随便把它推翻的。”“在满清政府方面，对于外国侵略者抱绥靖妥协态度，而对于人民则坚持武力镇压，这样的政策已不再有什么动摇了。”一八四○年到一八六四年的历史表明，帝国主义与封建势力相结合，成为压在中国人民头上的两座大山。自此以后，帝国主义逐步建立了对于满清政府的控制。同时，中国也产生了一批较“新”的官僚，如求助于外国军队而剿平了太平天国的曾国藩、左宗棠、李鸿章等，他们想以洋务的皮毛来维持旧统治，尽着为侵略者开辟道路的任务。所以书中指出：“帝国主义者的经济侵略破坏了中国的封建经济，从而在中国不可免地要出现资本主义的因素；但帝国主义并不愿意中国的资本主义正常地发展。帝国主义者又要求中国在一个对外极端软弱无能而对内有力量‘维持秩序’的政府的统治下面，从而使中国永不可能成为独立的国家。李鸿章这样的‘洋务运动’正是符合于帝国主义的要求，因而是为帝国主义所赞助的。”
    辛亥革命的爆发，虽使帝国主义者一时受到震撼，但它们立刻看出当时中国革命的领导者和革命人民的幼稚可欺，狡猾地决定了向中国人民反攻；它们找到了袁世凯作为他们统治中国的工具，并一直支持到袁世凯爬上皇帝的宝座。“美国、日本、英国、德国对于袁世凯建立独裁以至恢复帝制，都曾经给以怂恿和鼓励，那是不可掩饰的事实。”袁世凯死后，帝国主义国家各自寻找其有力的工具，互争霸权。北洋军阀系统在袁死后分裂为“直系”与“皖系”两派。“直系”军阀冯国璋、曹锟、吴佩孚等正是美英帝国主义所运用的工具；“皖系”军阀段祺瑞以及“奉系”军阀张作霖则是日本帝国主义膝下的宠儿。本书指出：华盛顿会议以后，各帝国主义在华互争霸权的斗争，就反映为各派军阀的频繁不绝的内战。帝国主义的代理人，不论是日本的还是美英的，同样是卖国求荣、制造内战和残害人民的罪魁。通过对太平天国、辛亥革命和第一次国内革命战争前夕这三个历史时期的讨论，本书很尖锐地指出帝国主义者在这三个时期的一贯立场，都是扶持反革命势力，破坏中国革命，阻挠中国进步。在国际帝国主义者中间，美帝国主义者尤其狠恶狡诈。
    在中国和帝国主义国家的关系问题上，有些人常有许多谬误观念，幻想从血污满身的帝国主义身上寻找支持力量。——这正是戊戌维新运动及其以后同类政治运动的悲剧。在清算第一次国内革命战争以前的八十五年历史时，本书分析了这种幼稚的幻想的导源和危害性，譬如维新运动者“以为可以用不着正面反对帝国主义，只要用改良主义的办法就可以实现资本主义的改革，顺便地也就解决了中国的独立问题。”但是帝国主义却把这种幻想作为阻止人民革命的避雷针。在中国是没有改良主义前途的。“帝国主义列强侵入中国的目的，决不是要把封建的中国变成资本主义的中国。帝国主义列强的目的和这相反，它们是要把中国变成它们的半殖民地和殖民地。”（毛主席：“中国革命和中国共产党”）因此本书指出维新运动者不在争取民族独立斗争的基础上实现资本主义改革的想法是注定要失败的，又如辛亥革命的领袖们由于对帝国主义存着幻想，向袁世凯采取调和妥协的态度，结果不能不招致失败。本书由此得出极其有益的结论：对帝国主义及其所选出的代理人的任何幻想，都会对人民解放事业造成严重的损害！
    人民并不幻想帝国主义的支持，也不仰赖帝国主义的“承认”。毛主席在“中国革命和中国共产党”中说：“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程。”本书一开始就把贯串在近代史中这两根线索挑了出来：“当满清政府第一次签字于卖国条约上时，也正是中国人民针对外国资产阶级侵略者从事爱国主义斗争的开始。”因而，本书不但论述了中国遭受帝国主义侵略的悲痛历史，以及由此形成的畸形政治关系，而且剖析了这种悲痛的历史和畸形的政治关系是怎样被中国人民的革命实践所变革着。在分析中国人民怎样对待帝国主义侵略者时，本书始终珍视人民在各个历史时期中所做出的革命伟业，批判了对近代史若干资产阶级作家的谬见。但也并不讳言人民在斗争中一些认识上和行动上的错误，它历史地按着人民觉悟的水平、可能采取的斗争方式，以及帝国主义侵略日益逼紧的形势作了具体的分析，击溃了那些指手划脚“旁观者”的议论。
    在新版本中，作者除去订正了有些历史材料的错误和用语的不当之外，在一八六四年以后帝国主义侵略势力与封建势力之间的关系上，在戊戌维新运动与帝国主义势力的关系上，在袁世凯与整个欧洲资产阶级的关系上，都作了一些补充说明。对于五四前夕国内外条件的变化，中国社会阶级关系和思想潮流的变动，五四运动的历史意义，也做了一些增补。尤其重要的是添写了“反帝国主义的战斗旗帜”一节，论述中国共产党的诞生和它的第二次代表大会宣言的重大历史意义。这次大会的宣言，空前地向中国人民明确地分析了中国国家所处的情况，并第一次地在中国人民面前把中国的民主问题和民族独立问题连在一起，展开了革命运动的广大远景。增添这一节是异常必要的，因为从此灾难深重的中国人民，在和强大的帝国主义及其在中国的
    一切走狗的斗争中，就有了最可信赖的领导者了。
    应该指出，本书仍有一些缺点。主要是缺之中国近代经济状况的分析。譬如，对于满清政府最初在对外关系上之所以采取闭关锁国政策，没有从当时支持这一政策的自给自足的经济基础来说明；对于民国元年以后中国内部产生各派军阀斗争的经济原因，即地方的农业经济（不是统一的资本主义经济）以及帝国主义划分势力范围的政策，也缺少阐释。其次，对于中国人民革命斗争的分析，也还用力不够。特别是正面地论述近代中国革命思想发展的梗概不够清晰，使近代史中的革命思想的主流不够突出。此外，引文偶有脱漏，注脚中的某些参考书名未用原名而使人难以查考。
    总之，这本书较有系统地论证了毛主席在“中国革命和中国共产党”和“新民主主义论”中所指出的中国近代史的主题，是目前近代史著作中较好的
    一本。在今天，反对帝国主义依然是我们的严重的任务。本书的新版本，可以作为学习中国近代史的辅助读物，有助于我们从思想上武装起来，更勇敢地去进行反对帝国主义的斗争。
