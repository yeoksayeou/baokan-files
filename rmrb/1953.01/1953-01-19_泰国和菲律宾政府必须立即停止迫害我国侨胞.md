    Thailand and the Philippines Governments Must Immediately Stop Persecuting Our Overseas Chinese Compatriots
    Recently, the reactionary governments of Thailand and the Philippines have successively created incidents of persecuting our overseas Chinese compatriots. The Thai Luang Phibuns government, at the instigation of US and British imperialism, has been carrying out large-scale arrests of Thai peace movement activists and our overseas Chinese compatriots since November 10, 1952, illegally detaining Lin Xue, editor-in-chief of the Bangkok Chinese newspaper "Quan Min Bao," and many others; on November 24, the Thai government unreasonably ordered the closure of "Quan Min Bao," a long-standing newspaper representing the opinions of the overseas Chinese community; on December 8, Thai police carried out another large-scale arrest, with many of those arrested being overseas Chinese; on December 23, another two hundred overseas Chinese were illegally arrested in Bangkok; the next day, the Thai government openly ordered the closure of "Quan Min Bao," and also arrested Zhang Yizheng, the principal of Huang Hun School, the largest overseas Chinese school in Bangkok, and seven teachers. At the same time, on December 27, the Philippine government unreasonably searched Chinese shops and residences in Manila and many other towns, arresting more than 300 overseas Chinese. All of these are extremely serious incidents of blatant infringement upon the legitimate rights of our overseas Chinese compatriots.
    It is a well-known fact that our overseas Chinese compatriots in Thailand have suffered all kinds of oppression from imperialism and the Thai reactionaries. In recent years, this situation has become increasingly serious. The Thai government has continuously carried out illegal searches, arrests, and unreasonable deportations of overseas Chinese, arbitrarily closing overseas Chinese schools and destroying the education, culture, industry, commerce, and news publishing of overseas Chinese. Last February, the Thai government suddenly increased the "Alien Identification Card Fee" by a staggering twenty times, carrying out an intolerable plunder of our overseas Chinese compatriots. Similarly, the Philippine government, under the direction of US imperialism, has consistently implemented its reactionary policy of persecuting overseas Chinese. The legitimate rights of overseas Chinese in the Philippines to reside, operate businesses, receive education, and express opinions have been continuously violated by the Quirino puppet government. Especially in recent years, the Quirino government has used a series of anti-Chinese measures, such as the "Retail Trade Nationalization Act," the "Labor Nationalization Act," the "School Nationalization Act," and the "Teacher Nationalization Act," to further destroy the culture, education, industry, and commerce of overseas Chinese, and has left tens of thousands of overseas Chinese unemployed and unable to make a living. Our government and people have repeatedly lodged serious protests against the Thai and Philippine governments for their unreasonable atrocities in oppressing our overseas Chinese compatriots, but the Luang Phibuns government and the Quirino government have not only shown no sign of repentance, but have instead intensified their efforts to implement their consistent reactionary policy of persecuting overseas Chinese by carrying out large-scale arrests of our overseas Chinese compatriots and closing Chinese newspapers. This cannot but arouse the great anger of our people.
    Now, the crimes of the Thai and Philippine governments in persecuting our overseas Chinese compatriots have not stopped. We must once again warn the Thai Luang Phibuns government and the Philippine Quirino government not to forget an important fact: the overseas Chinese residing in Thailand and the Philippines have a strong motherland; the Thai and Philippine governments' hostility towards overseas Chinese is a manifestation of hostility towards the Chinese people, and in today's world, no matter who it is, being hostile to the 475 million liberated Chinese people is a very serious matter, a very foolish matter. Those in power in the Thai government and the Philippine government must clear their minds, must immediately stop any actions to persecute our overseas Chinese compatriots, and must guarantee the legitimate rights of our overseas Chinese compatriots.

### 泰国和菲律宾政府必须立即停止迫害我国侨胞

    泰国和菲律宾政府必须立即停止迫害我国侨胞
    最近泰国和菲律宾反动政府接连制造了迫害我国侨胞的事件。泰国銮披汶政府在美、英帝国主义的唆使下，从一九五二年十一月十日起大举逮捕泰国和平运动人士和我国侨胞，非法拘留了曼谷华侨报纸“全民报”总编辑林学等多人；十一月二十四日，泰国政府无理令历史悠久的、代表华侨民意的“全民报”停刊；十二月八日，泰国警察实行了另一次大规模逮捕，被捕者有许多人是华侨；十二月二十三日，又有两百名华侨在曼谷被非法逮捕；第二天，泰国政府公开命令封闭“全民报”，又逮捕了曼谷最大的华侨学校黄魂学校校长张亦铮及教员七人。与此同时，菲律宾政府于十二月二十七日无理搜查了马尼拉和其他许多城镇的华侨商店和住宅，逮捕华侨三百余人。所有这些都是蛮横侵犯我国侨胞正当权利的极端严重的事件。
    我国旅泰侨胞备受帝国主义和泰国反动派的种种压迫，已是人所共知的事实。近年来，这种情况是越来越严重了。泰国政府对华侨不断施行非法搜查、逮捕和无理驱逐出境，肆意封闭华侨学校，摧残华侨的教育、文化、工商业和新闻出版事业。去年二月，泰国政府更把“外侨随身证例费”突然提高了二十倍之巨，对我国侨胞实行了不堪容忍的大掠夺。同样地，菲律宾政府在美帝国主义的指使下，也一贯执行其迫害华侨的反动政策。菲律宾华侨的居住、营业、教育、言论等正当权利，曾不断遭到季里诺傀儡政府的侵犯。特别是近几年以来，季里诺政府利用所谓“零售业菲律宾化法案”、“劳工菲律宾化法案”、“学校菲律宾化法案”和“教师菲律宾化法案”等一连串的排华措施，进一步摧残华侨的文化教育和工商事业，并使数万华侨陷于失业，无法为生。我国政府和人民对泰国和菲律宾政府压迫我国侨胞的这种无理暴行，曾屡次提出严重抗议，但是銮披汶政府和季里诺政府非但丝毫没有改悔之心，反而变本加厉地以大肆逮捕我国侨胞和封闭华侨报纸的行为来加紧执行其一贯迫害华侨的反动政策。这不能不激起我国人民的重大愤怒。
    现在，泰国和菲律宾政府迫害我国侨胞的罪行仍未停止，我们必须再次警告泰国銮披汶政府和菲律宾季里诺政府，你们不要忘记一个重要的事实，这就是：旅居泰国和菲律宾的华侨有着强大的祖国；泰国和菲律宾政府敌视华侨，也就是敌视中国人民的表现，而在今日的世界上，不论是谁，敌视四亿七千五百万解放了的中国人民，那就是非常严重的事，非常愚蠢的事。泰国政府和菲律宾政府的当政者必须澄清一下自己的头脑，必须立即停止迫害我国侨胞的任何行动，必须保障我国侨胞的正当权利。
