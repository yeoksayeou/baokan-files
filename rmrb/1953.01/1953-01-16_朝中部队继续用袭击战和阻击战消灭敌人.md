Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th – From January 6th to 10th, the Korean and Chinese People's troops continued to annihilate the enemy with raids and ambushes. On the Eastern and Central fronts, our troops' repeated raids have made the enemy apprehensive and restless every night. The two raids our troops conducted on the 8th near Sapae-ri, south of Go City, were the largest battles in the five days. That night, two raiding parties of our army attacked the puppet South Korean troops holding the 565.7 high ground and the high ground north of Little Magpie Peak. Although the number of these two raiding parties was only a quarter of the enemy's, they beat the enemy entrenched in the fortifications to a bloody pulp.

	In more than an hour of courageous fighting, the raiding parties annihilated most of two companies of the defending enemy, totaling 304 men, and captured four light and heavy machine guns and sixteen infantry automatic weapons. On the 6th and 9th, our troops fought two small battles on the high ground to the left of Shangganling north of Jinhua and directly south of the high ground to the right of Shangganling, annihilating a total of three enemy platoons. Both of these battles took only five minutes from start to finish. On the nights of the 7th and 9th, near Iwam-ri and Gohori southeast of Kimhwa, our army's raiding parties also annihilated all of two and a half enemy platoons and most of an enemy platoon. In other places, our army also conducted two raids, annihilating a total of two enemy platoons. In these five days, our army annihilated most of two companies, one platoon, and all of seven and a half platoons of South Korean puppet troops, totaling 455 men, in eight raids on the Eastern and Central fronts.

	During these five days, the enemy also launched several attacks on our army's forward positions, but were all repelled. The enemy's attack on North Mountain, East Byeon Village, east of Panmunjom, on the morning of the 8th was the largest. On this day, two companies of the enemy, under the cover of 22 tanks and six aircraft, attacked this small position four times in succession, but were defeated by our army's strong counterattacks. In two hours of fierce fighting, our army annihilated 93 enemy soldiers, captured five light and heavy machine guns, one flamethrower, and three rifles, and destroyed one enemy tank.

	During these five days, our army's frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down nine enemy aircraft and damaged eight; mobile artillery fire killed or wounded more than 600 enemy soldiers.

    朝中部队继续用袭击战和阻击战消灭敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】一月六日到十日的五天中，朝中人民部队继续用袭击战和阻击战消灭敌人。东线和中线我军对敌人的多次袭击，打得敌人提心吊胆，夜夜不安。八日我军在高城以南沙飞里附近的两次袭击作战，是五天中最大的战斗。这天夜里，我军的两支夜袭队分头攻击五六五点七高地和小鹊峰以北高地的李伪军。这两支夜袭队的人数虽然只及敌人人数的四分之一，但是他们却把据守在工事里的敌人打得头破血流。
    在一个多小时的奋勇作战中，袭击队共歼灭守敌两个连的大部，计三百零四名，并缴获轻重机枪四挺，步兵自动火器十六支。在六日和九日，我军在金化以北上甘岭左边高地上和在上甘岭右边高地的正南各打了一次小仗，共歼灭敌人三个班。这两次战斗从开始到结束，都只用了五分钟时间。七日和九日夜里，在金城东南边岩里和科湖里附近，我军的夜袭队也歼灭敌军两个半班全部和一个排的大部。另外在别的地方，我军也进行了两次袭击战，共歼灭敌军两个班。这五天，我军在东线和中线的八次袭击战斗中，共歼伪军两个连、一个排的大部和七个半班的全部，计四百五十五名。
    这五天中，敌人也向我军前沿阵地进行多次袭击，但都被击退。八日早晨，敌人向板门店以东东便村北山的袭击是最大的一次。这一天，两个连的敌人在二十二辆坦克、六架飞机的掩护下，连续向这一个小小的阵地攻击四次，都在我军坚强的反击下败退。在两小时的激战中，我军歼敌九十三名，缴获轻重机枪五挺、火焰喷射器一具、枪三支，击毁敌坦克一辆。
    这五天中，我军前线高射炮火击落敌机九架，击伤敌机八架；游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军六百多名。
