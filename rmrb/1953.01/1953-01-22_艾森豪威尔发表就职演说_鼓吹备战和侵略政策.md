Xinhua News Agency, January 21st:

    Eisenhower was formally inaugurated as President of the United States in Washington on the 20th. At the inauguration ceremony, he delivered a lengthy speech elaborating on the policies that the new Republican government of the United States will pursue. The main points of his policies are: for the benefit of American monopoly capital, to further expand armaments and prepare for war, to strengthen and intensify the organization of various international aggressive blocs, and to intensify the plunder and enslavement of the people of the world.
    At the beginning of his speech, Eisenhower spoke a great deal about defining a common "belief" for the so-called "free world." According to him, this common "belief" is to unite "the farmer in Burma," "the shepherd in southern Italy," "the mountain dweller in the Andes," and "the wheat grower in Iowa." Eisenhower gave a brilliant explanation of the true meaning of this kind of maintenance. He said that this maintenance is due to a "simple need," that is: "We (the United States) need to find markets in the world for the surplus products of our farms and factories. Similarly, we need to obtain raw materials and products from remote places for these farms and factories."
    Eisenhower said that due to this "basic law," the United States is "destined to assume the leadership of the free world."
    Eisenhower then announced nine "immutable" principles in the posture of "leadership."
    The first is to "develop strength," which he said is "the first task of a politician." While advocating for arms expansion and war preparation, Eisenhower hypocritically pretended to even "detest war," but in the second article he showed his love for war. He said that as a means of solving problems, the "final choice" is still the "soldier's backpack." This reminds people of what Eisenhower said after the outbreak of the Korean War. He advocated the use of atomic bombs and said that he would rather have a destructive war than peace.
    The third principle Eisenhower announced is America first. He said: "We believe that the strength and security of our country is the hope of free people everywhere." Therefore, "every free citizen of ours and every free citizen everywhere" must put this highest "cause" above themselves.
    In the fourth article, Eisenhower hypocritically said that the United States "will never use our strength to force other people to accept our own preferred political and economic system." But in the following fifth, sixth, and seventh articles, Eisenhower's hideous face was revealed. He demanded that all of America's "free friends" bear the "full" burden of "common defense." He also demanded the promotion of a "policy" "everywhere" that "encourages" American arms production and "profitable trade." He also called for the establishment of "regional groups of free people" "throughout the world," which means strengthening the North Atlantic Aggressive Bloc and intensifying the organization of the planned Pacific Group, as tools for American imperialism to plunder and enslave the people of Europe and Asia. He further pointed out that the "leaders" of the Western European puppet states should "work harder to realize" the so-called "unity" in order to "unanimously gather their strength together" and "unify" under the "leadership" of the United States.
    In the eighth article, Eisenhower hypocritically pretended to oppose racial supremacy and oppose sacrificing other nations, attempting to cover up the conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians" that the US government is actively planning.
    In the ninth article, Eisenhower talked about the United Nations, and he clearly implied that countries in the United Nations that follow the United States should provide more strength for the United States to use in war, emphasizing the need to turn the United Nations into an "effective force."
    After listing these "action programs" of the U.S. government, Eisenhower wanted "people of all countries" to "abide by this program" and threatened: "We must be prepared to dare to do everything for our country."
    Eisenhower especially emphasized that the American people should be prepared to make "any sacrifice" for these programs and "must accept it gladly." He emphasized: "No one, no family, no society can be outside this call."
    In order to promote massacre and carry out intimidation to the people, Eisenhower chose a special exhibit to decorate his inauguration ceremony. He pulled a cannon said to be able to launch atomic bombs from Aberdeen, Maryland, to Washington, and paraded it out at his inauguration ceremony.

### 艾森豪威尔发表就职演说  鼓吹备战和侵略政策

    艾森豪威尔发表就职演说
    鼓吹备战和侵略政策
     【新华社二十一日讯】艾森豪威尔二十日在华盛顿正式就任美国总统。在就职典礼上，他发表了一篇冗长的演说，阐述了美国共和党新政府所将推行的政策。他的政策的要点就是：为了美国垄断资本的利益，进一步扩军备战，加强和加紧组织各种国际性的侵略集团，变本加厉地掠夺和奴役全世界的人民。
    艾森豪威尔在他演说开始时讲了许多话，要给所谓“自由世界”规定一个共同的“信念”。据他说这个共同的“信念”是要把“缅甸的农民”，“南意大利的牧人”，“安达斯的山地居民”和“衣阿华州的种麦人”统统维系在一起。艾森豪威尔对于这种维系的真实意义，作了一个精辟的说明。他说这种维系是出于一种“简单的需要”，就是：“我们（美国）需要在世界上替我们的农场和工厂的过剩产品寻找市场。同样，我们需要为这些农场和工厂取得遥远地方的原料和产品。”
    艾森豪威尔说，由于这个“基本法则”，美国“命定了要担负起自由世界的领导责任”。
    艾森豪威尔随即以“领导”的姿态宣布了九条“不可变移的”原则。
    第一条是“发展实力”，他说这是“政治家的第一个任务”。在这样鼓吹扩军备战的时候，艾森豪威尔极端虚伪地装作甚至是“憎恶战争”的样子，但他在第二条里就表明了自己对战争的嗜好。他说，作为解决问题的手段，“最后的选择”还是“士兵的背包”。这使人想起艾森豪威尔在朝鲜战争发生后说过的一句话，他主张用原子弹，并说他宁愿要招致毁灭的战争也不要和平。
    艾森豪威尔宣布的第三条原则就是美国第一。他说：“我们认为我们国家的实力与安全是一切地方自由人的希望的寄托。”因此，“每一个我们的自由公民以及一切地方的每一个自由公民”都必须把这一个最高的“事业”放在自己之上。
    在第四条里，艾森豪威尔伪善地说，美国“决不利用我们的实力强使其他人民接受我们自己喜爱的政治和经济体制”。但在紧接着的第五第六第七各条，艾森豪威尔狰狞的面貌就原形毕露了。他要求美国所有的“自由的朋友”承担起“共同防务”的“充分的”负担。他又要求在“一切地方”都推进这样一种“政策”，这种“政策”“鼓励”美国军备生产和“有利可图的贸易”。他还要求在“全世界”成立“自由人民的区域性集团”，这就是说要加强北大西洋侵略集团以及加紧组织正在策划中的太平洋集团，作为美帝国主义掠夺奴役欧洲和亚洲人民的工具。他更指明西欧仆从国家的“领袖们更加劲地努力来实现”所谓“统一”，以便“一致地把自己的力量汇集在一起”，“统一”在美国的“领导”之下。
    艾森豪威尔在第八条里虚伪地装作反对种族优越论，反对以其他民族为牺牲品，企图掩盖美国政府正在积极策划着的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。
    艾森豪威尔在第九条里谈到联合国，他明显地暗示在联合国里追随美国的国家要提供更多实力供美国进行战争之用，强调需要把联合国变成一个“有效的力量”。
    艾森豪威尔在列举了美国政府的这些“行动纲领”之后，要“各国人民”一体“遵守这个纲领”，并且威胁地说：“我们必须准备为了我们的国家敢做一切事情”。
    艾森豪威尔特别着重地要美国人民准备为这些纲领作“任何牺牲”，并且“必须欣然承受”。他着重说：“不能有任何人、任何家庭、任何社会置身于这个号召之外。”
    为了向人民宣传屠杀并进行恫吓，艾森豪威尔选择了一个特殊的展览品来装点他的就职典礼，他把一门据说是可以施放原子弹的大炮从马里兰州的亚伯丁拉到华盛顿，在他就职典礼时拿出来游行。
