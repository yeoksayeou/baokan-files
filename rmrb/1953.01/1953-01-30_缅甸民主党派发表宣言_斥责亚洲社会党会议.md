    Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Rangoon Delayed Dispatch: The Burmese Labor-Peasant Party, People's Unity Party, People's Peace Front and other parties and organizations recently issued a declaration, denouncing the Asian Socialist Conference held in Rangoon not long ago. The declaration said that the convening of this meeting was entirely the result of listening to the instructions of imperialism, and its purpose was to deceive the people, split the forces of peace, and oppose the struggle of the Asian countries' people for national independence. The declaration pointed out: The Socialist Party has long become a traitor to the people and directly serves imperialism. British Labour Party leader Attlee personally participated in the meeting this time in order to instruct the Asian Socialist Party to carry out the orders of his master to strangle the Asian people's movement against imperialism. The declaration finally called on the people of Asia to unite, to realize the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and to fight to smash the imperialist plot to use the Asian Socialist Party to prepare to launch a new war.

    缅甸民主党派发表宣言  斥责亚洲社会党会议
    【新华社二十九日讯】仰光迟到消息：缅甸工农党、人民团结党、人民和平阵线等党派和团体最近发表宣言，斥责不久以前在仰光举行的亚洲社会党会议。宣言说，这个会议的召开，完全是听从帝国主义的指使的结果，其目的在于欺骗人民，分裂和平势力，反对亚洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争。宣言指出：社会党早已成为人民的叛徒，直接为帝国主义服务。英国工党首领艾德礼这次亲自参加会议，就是为了指使亚洲社会党执行他的主子绞杀亚洲人民反对帝国主义的运动的命令。宣言最后号召亚洲人民团结起来，为实现亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议，为粉碎帝国主义利用亚洲社会党准备发动新战争的阴谋而斗争。
