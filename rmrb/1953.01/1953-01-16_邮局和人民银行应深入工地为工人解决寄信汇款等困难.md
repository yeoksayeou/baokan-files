To the Editor: We are workers from the Fifth Engineering Area of the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company of Beijing. We request the Beijing Post Office and the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China to quickly solve the difficulties of sending letters, remitting money, and saving money for construction workers in Beijing.

Our engineering area has more than 400 workers, the vast majority of whom are from other places. Every comrade needs to write several letters home and remit some money. However, there is not even a mailbox or a place to sell stamps in the engineering area. Every time we send a letter, we have to travel more than ten miles back and forth to the postal agency near Xizhimen; and the postal agency does not handle remittance business or registration procedures. If we want to remit money, we have to go to a post office or bank even further away. What makes people even more anxious is that when we get off work and rush to the city, the post office and the bank are already closed. In order to remit money, we have to wait until Sunday to rush to the post office or bank early in the morning to squeeze in for a whole morning (they are not open in the afternoon). Otherwise, we have to ask for leave or be absent from work. In addition, there are a few workers who do not have family burdens and cannot spend all their wages; but there are no organizations near the engineering area that handle savings.

As far as we know, workers on many other construction sites in Beijing also have the same difficulties in sending letters, remitting money, and saving money. We heard that the Tianjin Post Office has set up postal mailboxes at larger construction sites and has entrusted people to sell stamps separately; whenever wages are paid at various construction sites, the Tianjin Post Office and the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China also send mobile work teams to the construction sites to handle remittance and savings business. Construction workers in Tianjin feel very convenient about this. We hope that the Beijing Post Office and the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China will do the same. This will not only solve the difficulties of our construction workers, but also be beneficial to the development of postal, remittance, and savings businesses.

    邮局和人民银行应深入工地为工人解决寄信汇款等困难
    编辑同志：我们是北京市华北基本建设工程公司第五工区的工人。我们要求北京邮局和中国人民银行北京分行赶快为我们北京市的建筑工人解决寄信、汇钱和储蓄的困难。
    我们这个工区共有四百多工人，绝大多数是外地人。每个同志谁都要给家里写几封信和汇一些钱。可是工区连个邮箱和代售邮票的地方都没有，我们每次发信都得来回跑十多里地，到西直门附近的邮政代办所去；而邮政代办所不办理汇兑业务和挂号手续，我们要汇款还得跑到更远的邮局或银行去。使人更着急的是：我们下了工跑到城里，邮局和银行也早就下班了。为了汇款，我们就得等到星期日早早地跑到邮局或是银行去挤上一个上午（他们下午不上班）。不然就得请假或旷工。此外，还有少数工人没有家庭负担，工资用不完；但是工区附近没有办理储蓄的组织。
    据我们所知，北京市其他很多工地的工人同志们在寄信、汇款和储蓄时，也都有着同样的困难。听说天津邮局在较大的工地都设有邮政信箱，并分别委托了代售邮票的人；每当各工地发工资时，天津邮局和中国人民银行天津市分行还派流动工作组到工地去办理汇兑和储蓄业务。天津市的建筑工人对此都感到很方便。我们希望北京邮局和中国人民银行北京分行也这样作。这不但解决了我们建筑工人的困难，而且对邮递、汇兑和储蓄业务的开展也是有好处的。
