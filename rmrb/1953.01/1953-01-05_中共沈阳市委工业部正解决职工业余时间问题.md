Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily:

    Editor: The reader's letter and commentary "Some Factories in Shenyang Have Not Yet Rationally Allocated Staff and Workers' Leisure Time," published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on December 6, 1952, criticized the shortcomings of our department in implementing the "Decision of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee on the Allocation of Leisure Time for Staff and Workers in State-Owned and Public-Private Joint Factories." This criticism is very good and has greatly promoted our work. We are now gradually studying and thoroughly resolving all issues related to the rational allocation of leisure time for staff and workers in the factories concerned. We will inform you of the effectiveness of this work and our self-criticism in a letter later.

    中共沈阳市委工业部正解决职工业余时间问题
    编辑同志：一九五二年十二月六日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登的“沈阳市部分工厂尚未合理支配职工业余时间”的读者来信述评，对我部在贯彻中共沈阳市委会“关于国、公营工厂职工业余活动时间支配问题的决定”中的缺点提出批评。这个批评很好，对我们的工作起了很大的推动作用。现在我们正在逐步研究彻底解决有关各厂职工业余活动时间合理支配的各项问题。这一工作的效果和我们的检讨，以后当函告你们。
