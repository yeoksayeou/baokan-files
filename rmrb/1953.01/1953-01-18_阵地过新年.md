Celebrating the New Year on the Front Lines (Shandong Kuai Shu)
Volunteer Soldier Li Delong

　　Snowflakes flutter as the New Year arrives, celebrating the New Year on the front lines is truly lively.
　　A large pine bower is erected in a concealed location, with slogans posted in many places.
　　The slogan at the entrance of the tunnel is:
　　"The New Year brings new tasks,"
　　"Achieve new merits in the New Year";
　　Chairman Mao's portrait hangs in the center, with the words "Resist America, Aid Korea" written on the banner.
　　The mess hall entrance also has couplets, outlined in color.
　　The upper line is: "Guarantee good living conditions for the troops,"
　　The lower line is: "Be strong and powerful to kill the invaders";
　　The banner has four characters, reading from left to right as "Fragrant Rice, Good Dishes".
　　Comrades shave, wash their faces, and bathe, their red faces full of smiles.
　　Comrades have prepared three cups of celebratory wine, hey! This is of great significance.
　　The first cup, wishing Chairman Mao good health!
　　The second cup, welcoming the upsurge of large-scale economic construction in the motherland!
　　The third cup, celebrating the great victories of the past two years in resisting America and aiding Korea, heroes,
　　Models, and meritorious individuals will achieve new merits!
　　The sound of gongs and drums echoes in the tunnel, with singing, playing instruments, dancing, and acting.
　　The club is organizing a show, and each squad is making dumplings.
　　Old Wang says: "The dumpling filling this year is very good!"
　　Old Li says: "That's right, look, half pork and half cabbage, soy sauce, scallions, fresh ginger, and star anise."
　　Squad leader of the Eighth squad uses a bayonet to grind salt, while the vice-squad leader is preparing the dough;
　　They talk about combat stories, when suddenly a sentry reports from outside:
　　"Report, squad leader, two platoons of enemies are sneaking towards here,
　　It looks like they are attacking."
　　Upon hearing this, Squad Leader Xiang Guo'an does not delay, picks up a light machine gun, grabs
　　A handful of grenades and tucks them into his waist; he tells everyone to be ready, but they can
　　Continue making dumplings. Squad Leader of the Eighth squad moves in low to the foxhole,
　　How strange, why are the enemies running straight back?
　　Haha! The enemy's tanks have been destroyed by our artillery, how dare the devils not run back!
　　Xiang Guo'an aims at the devils and pulls the trigger, and with a "da-da," a
　　Devil falls backward.
　　Taking advantage of the enemy's disarray, Xiang Guo'an sweeps his machine gun non-stop.
　　Outside the tunnel, "da-da-da-da" the gunshots ring out,
　　Inside the tunnel, "ba-ba-ba-ba" the sound of knives chopping on the cutting board is loud;
　　Inside the tunnel, chopping vegetables and meat to make dumplings, outside the tunnel, hitting the devils in the back of the head.
　　Xiang Guo'an says: "Devils, do you want to eat dumplings? As long as you surrender your
　　Guns, we'll give you enough to eat; if you don't surrender, I'll give you a burst of
　　'Peanuts,' to see what they taste like."
　　In the time it takes to say this, a large number of devils have died, and they release a smoke screen and run away quickly.
　　The dumplings in the pot boil and boil with the hot water;
　　The devils outside hear the gunshots and run around in confusion.
　　The squad leader returns with a smile,
　　The comrades all say: "The artillery shoots well, the squad leader fights well."
　　After eating the dumplings, they hold an evening party, and the comrades sing and talk with high spirits.
　　The devils who ran back got a fright, and hearing the gunshots, their hair stands on end.
　　This quick story ends here, wishing comrades success in killing enemies and achieving meritorious service in the New Year!

    阵地过新年（山东快书）
    志愿军战士　李德龙
    雪花飘飘年来到，阵地上过新年好热闹。
    隐蔽的地方扎起大松坊，许多地方贴口号。
    坑道口贴的是：
    “新年带来新任务”，
    “新年再立新功劳”；
    毛主席像当中挂，横批上写的是“抗美援朝”。
    炊事班门口也贴对联，对联四边用颜色描。
    上联是：“保证部队生活好”，
    下联是：“身强力壮杀强盗”；
    横批上写了四个字，从左往右看是“饭香菜好”。
    同志们剃头刮脸又洗澡，通红的脸上带着笑。
    同志们准备了三杯喜酒，嘿！这个意义可不小。
    第一杯，祝毛主席身体健康！
    第二杯，迎接祖国大规模的经济建设高潮！
    第三杯，庆祝抗美援朝两年来伟大胜利，英雄、
    模范、功臣再立新功劳！
    坑道里面锣鼓响，吹、拉、跳、唱好热闹。
    俱乐部里排节目，各班都把饺子包。
    老王说：“今年的饺子馅很好啊！”
    老李说：“可不是，你看，猪肉白菜各一半，酱
    油、葱花、鲜姜捎大料。”
    八班长用刺刀轧咸盐，副班长一旁把面来调；
    你一言我一语说着战斗故事，忽然哨兵从外边来
    报告：
    “报告班长，有两个排的敌人鬼鬼祟祟地向这里
    来啦，看样子像进攻。”
    八班长向国安一听不怠慢，顺手拿起轻机枪，抓
    了一把手榴弹插在腰；吩咐大家准备好，还可
    继续把饺子包。八班长低身运动到散兵坑，好
    奇怪，敌人为什么直往后跑？
    哈哈！敌人的坦克已被我炮兵打坏了，鬼子兵他
    哪敢不往回跑！
    向国安瞄准鬼子拉动枪栓，只听“哒哒”，一个
    鬼子往后倒。
    向国安趁着鬼子乱了阵，他的机枪就一个劲儿的
    扫。只听得：洞外边“哒哒哒哒”枪声响，
    只听得：洞里面“叭叭叭叭”刀剁菜板响声高；
    洞里面，剁菜剁肉包饺子，洞外边，打的是鬼子的后脑勺。
    向国安说：“鬼子兵，你要吃饺子吗？只要你缴
    枪过来就管你吃饱；你不缴枪我就给你这一梭
    子‘花生米’，你尝尝是什么味道。”
    说话间，鬼子已死了一大片，放起烟幕弹加快脚
    步跑。
    锅里的饺子随着开水滚又滚；
    外边的鬼子听见枪声胡乱跑。
    班长回来带笑容，
    同志们都说：“炮兵打得好，班长打得妙。”
    吃罢饺子开晚会，同志们说说唱唱情绪高。
    跑回去的鬼子得了吃惊病，听见枪声直麻到头发
    梢。
    这一段快书就说到这里，祝同志们新年杀敌立功
    劳！
