Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st (TASS): The Kremlin's ancient clock struck twelve precisely. Radio waves broadcast the chimes to every corner of the vast Soviet land, and so began the new year – 1953. The Soviet people knew they had fulfilled their responsibilities and welcomed the New Year with pride and satisfaction. The past year was a year of great strides forward and glorious victories. In this year, the Soviet people achieved significant successes in the development of the economy and culture. The great socialist country became even stronger. The Soviet people have confidence in their future, believing that 1953 will bring them new successes and joys, and that they will realize new and grand plans in 1953.

The Soviet capital was filled with a joyful atmosphere everywhere. Colorful lights adorned the fir trees decorating the rooms, shining through the glass windows covered with exquisite frost patterns. Revelry was everywhere. In homes, in the colorful halls of cultural palaces or workers' clubs, at New Year's banquets, people toasted the health of the best friend and teacher of the working people of the world – J.V. Stalin, and the glory of their Soviet motherland. Muscovites congratulated each other on the New Year and wished each other new victories in creative labor.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Moscow, January 1st (TASS) - Pravda published a New Year's editorial.

Pravda's editorial wrote that Soviet men and women and our friends in free China and the people's democratic countries are welcoming 1953 cheerfully and with confidence. They have accomplished much in the past year; in the New Year, even greater and more exciting work awaits them. The camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, united around the Soviet Union, enters the New Year with new plans for the construction of canals, shelterbelts, hydroelectric power stations, factories, palaces of science and culture—all things that make mankind happy and joyful. In the capitalist world, however, they are entering the New Year with discouragement and disappointment. They are afraid of the future. The imperialist warmongers enter the New Year looking at maps, thinking about new wars, plotting provocations, building military bases, and cultivating laboratories for killing germs. The editorial pointed out that in capitalist countries, millions of ordinary people look up with expectation to the great peace-loving socialist country, the Soviet Union, and express their determination to intensify the struggle for peace. In the past year, the forces of peace have grown stronger. Comrade Stalin's words, "If the peoples of all countries take up the cause of defending peace and carry this cause through to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated," have made a deep impression on the broad masses of the world. The World Peace Congress vividly demonstrated this.

    苏联各族人民欢欣鼓舞度新年
    “真理报”祝贺和平阵营带着新的建设计划跨进新的一年
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：克里姆林宫古老的钟整整地敲了十二响。无线电电波把钟声播送到辽阔的苏维埃国土的一切角落，于是新的一年——一九五三年开始了。苏联人民知道他们尽了自己的责任，都怀着骄傲和满意的心情欢迎新年。过去的一年是大步前进和获得辉煌胜利的一年。这一年中，苏联人民在经济、文化各方面的发展上获得了重大成就。伟大的社会主义国家更加富强了。苏联人民对他们的未来怀着信心，相信一九五三年将给他们带来新的成功和欢乐，他们将在一九五三年实现新的宏伟的计划。
    苏联的首都到处都洋溢着欢乐的气氛。装饰房间的枞树上装着五光十色的灯彩，灯光穿过披上了精巧冰花的玻璃窗照射出来。到处都在狂欢。在家庭中、在文化宫或工人俱乐部的彩色缤纷的大厅里，在庆贺新年的宴会上，人们为全世界劳动人民最好的朋友和导师——约·维·斯大林的健康，为他们的苏维埃祖国的光荣而干杯。莫斯科人互相祝贺新年快乐，在创造性的劳动中获得新的胜利。
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：真理报发表了新年社论。
    真理报社论写道，苏联男女和我们在自由中国及各人民民主国家的朋友们满怀信心地愉快地迎接一九五三年。在过去一年中，他们完成了不少的工作；在新的一年中，还有更伟大的、更令人兴奋的工作等着他们去完成。团结在苏联周围的和平、民主和社会主义阵营带着新的运河、防护林带、水力发电站、工厂、科学和文化宫这一切使人类幸福和愉快的事物的建设计划跨进新的一年。而在资本主义世界，却是灰心失望地走入新的一年。它们对将来感到恐惧。帝国主义战争制造者走入新的一年时对着地图想着新战争，想着挑衅计划，想着建筑军事基地和培养杀人细菌的实验室。社论指出：在资本主义国家，千百万普通人以期望的眼光仰望着伟大的爱好和平的社会主义国家苏联，并表示他们加紧进行争取和平的斗争的决心。在过去一年中，和平力量更加壮大了。斯大林同志的话“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固”，在全世界广大群众中留下了深刻的印象。世界人民和平大会生动地表现了这一点。
