The dazzling neon lights of a state-owned bookstore, not far from the Rakosi Integrated Factory in Budapest, are attracting people. Workers stream through the bookstore doors after work.

A young worker's eyes are suddenly drawn to a beautifully decorated, blue-covered book. It is a Hungarian-language edition of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I – the writings of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, whom he knows and respects. He immediately begins to browse this magnificent work. Page after page, Chairman Mao's brilliant analysis of the situation during China's First Revolutionary Civil War and his simple and easy-to-understand language captivate him.

"I want to buy a copy of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong!" A few minutes later, the bookstore clerk hands him a wrapped copy of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I.

Many people bought the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and expressed their thoughts.

Ronai, an assembler at the motorcycle factory attached to the Rakosi factory, said: "I have read many books about the Chinese people's struggle and creative labor, but I believe that only after reading the Selected Works of Mao Zedong did I truly and profoundly understand China."

The bookstore manager also said: "Our worker comrades have long been buying books about the Chinese people's heroic struggle and selfless labor with great interest and enthusiasm. Since the publication of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I, their interest in the Chinese situation has grown even more. Our bookstore received six hundred and fifty copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, but it has almost sold out in less than a week."

Chairman Mao's works are widely welcomed and loved in Hungary. In branches of state-owned bookstores throughout Hungary's urban and rural areas, Hungarian-language editions of Chairman Mao's works quickly sold out. To date, nearly 100,000 copies of Chairman Mao's various works have been published in Hungary, which is a large number in a country with a population of nine and a half million. To meet the demands of the Hungarian people, Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" have been reprinted, with a total circulation of approximately 40,000 copies. The Hungarian-language Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I, published by a special translation and compilation committee, was published in a total of 15,200 copies. Volumes II, III, and IV will continue to be published in the future.

Chairman Mao's works are being studied by members of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the broad masses. When they meet to discuss or talk about the Asian people's struggle against imperialism for freedom and independence, when they talk about the Chinese people's struggle and the Chinese and Korean people's joint struggle against American imperialist aggression, they often quote the viewpoints and statements from Chairman Mao's works. Feichi, a tram driver in Budapest, said at a meeting:

"Since I read Comrade Mao Zedong's works, I have more clearly understood the significance of the Korean people's struggle. I have a clearer understanding that the heroic Korean people, with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, will surely win the final victory."

The works of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, are being read and studied by tens of thousands of Hungarian people in Hungarian factories, rural areas, and libraries. From these works, the Hungarian people have further understood the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and have drawn useful experiences from these brilliant works. (Attached picture)

    匈牙利人民热爱毛主席著作
    离布达佩斯拉科西综合工厂不远的地方，一家国家书店的光耀夺目的霓虹灯正在吸引着人们。下班后的工人们络绎走进书店的大门。
    一个青年工人的目光突然被一本装璜得十分精美的，蓝色封面的书本所吸引。这是他所熟悉和敬仰的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的著作——匈牙利文版的毛泽东选集第一卷。他立刻开始翻阅这本辉煌的著作。一页又一页，书中毛主席对于中国第一次国内革命战争形势的天才分析和浅近易懂的语句，使得他爱不释手。
    “我要买一本毛泽东选集！”几分钟后，书店的营业员把一本包装好的毛泽东选集第一卷递到了他的手里。
    许多人买了毛泽东选集，并谈出了自己的感想。
    拉科西工厂附设的摩托车工厂的装配工人罗那伊说：“我读了许多关于中国人民的斗争和创造性劳动的书籍，不过，我认为，只有在我读了毛泽东选集以后，我才更深刻地真正地认识了中国。”
    书店的经理也说：“我们的工人兄弟们早就怀着极大的兴趣和热爱来购买关于中国人民英勇的斗争和忘我劳动的书籍。在毛泽东选集第一卷出版以后，他们对于中国情况的兴趣就更加增长了。我们的书店收到了六百五十本毛泽东选集，但是到现在还不满一个星期，就快卖完了。”
    毛主席的著作，在匈牙利受到了广泛的欢迎和热爱。在匈牙利的城乡各地国家书店的支店里，匈牙利文的毛主席的著作很快就销售一空。到现在为止，毛主席的各种著作在匈牙利已发行了近十万册，这在人口九百五十万的国家中是一个很大的数字。为了满足匈牙利人民的要求，毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”曾经再版，总共发行了约四万册。由一个专门的编译委员会出版的匈牙利文毛泽东选集第一卷，总共出版了一万五千二百册。将来还要继续出版第二卷、第三卷和第四卷。
    毛主席的著作被匈牙利劳动人民党的党员和广大群众研读着。他们在开会讨论或讲到关于亚洲人民反对帝国主义、争取自由和独立的解放斗争时，讲到中国人民斗争和中朝人民共同反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争时，常常引用毛主席著作里的论点和语句。布达佩斯的电车司机斐基在一次会议上说：
    “自从我读了毛泽东同志的著作后，我更清楚地了解了朝鲜人民斗争的意义。我更清楚地看到，英勇的朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军的支援下，一定会获得最后胜利的。”
    中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的著作正在匈牙利的工厂，农村，图书馆里被成千成万的匈牙利人民阅读着，研究着。匈牙利人民从这些著作里进一步地认识了中国人民的英勇斗争，并从这些光辉的著作里吸取有用的经验。（附图片）
