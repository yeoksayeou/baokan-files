    Strongly Protest US Government's Conspiracy to Murder the Rosenbergs
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The China Peace Committee, the All-China Democratic Women’s Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and the All-China Students’ Federation have separately or jointly sent telegrams to US President Truman, protesting the US government's fabricated charges to murder Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
    The telegram from the China Peace Committee stated: "The American judicial authorities fabricated the unfounded 'espionage' charge and sentenced Julius Rosenberg and his wife Ethel to death without any evidence. This shocking atrocity has aroused the angry protest of upright people all over the world. The obvious purpose of the American judicial authorities in harming innocent civilians in this outrageous manner is to create a war atmosphere in order to persecute the growing American peace movement that is striving for genuine world peace. Recently, the American judicial authorities, disregarding the protests of righteous people all over the world, insisted on upholding the original verdict, which is intolerable to all peace-loving people. We once again lodge a serious protest against this infringement of human rights by the American judicial authorities, demanding that you immediately revoke the sentences against the Rosenbergs and immediately restore their freedom."
    The protest telegram from the All-China Democratic Women’s Federation stated: The Rosenbergs are people with two children who had been living ordinary lives before their arrest. This sudden incident is about to take their lives and disrupt their family life. Chinese women feel extremely indignant at this barbaric crime of the American judicial authorities deliberately framing innocent people.
    The joint telegram from the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and the All-China Students’ Federation stated: We, representing the youth of all China, lodge a serious protest against this barbaric atrocity by the American judicial authorities, and resolutely demand that you immediately order the revocation of the illegal sentences against the Rosenbergs and restore their freedom. Otherwise, the US government will not be able to escape its responsibility for harming innocent people.

    严重抗议美国政府阴谋杀害罗森堡夫妇
    据新华社讯：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会和中华全国学生联合会分别或联合致电美国总统杜鲁门，抗议美国政府以捏造的罪名谋杀朱利叶斯·罗森堡夫妇。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的电文称：“美国司法当局捏造莫须有的‘间谍’罪名，没有任何证据就把朱利叶斯·罗森堡和他的妻子伊斯尔判处死刑。这一骇人听闻的暴行已经引起全世界正直人民的愤怒抗议。美国司法当局这种伤天害理陷害无辜平民的目的显然在于制造战争空气，来迫害为谋求真正的世界和平而努力的日益发展的美国和平运动。最近美国司法当局不顾全世界正义人士的抗议，坚持维持原判，这是一切爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的事情。我们再次对美国司法当局这种侵害人权的行为提出严正抗议，要求你立即撤销对罗森堡夫妇的判决，并立即恢复他们的自由。”
    中华全国民主妇女联合会的抗议电称：罗森堡夫妇是有着两个孩子的人，他们在被捕以前一直过着普通人民的生活。这一突如其来的事件就要夺去他们的生命并破坏了他们的家庭生活。中国妇女对美国司法当局这一蓄意陷害无辜人民的野蛮罪行感到无比的愤慨。
    中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会的联名电称：我们代表全中国青年对于美国司法当局这种野蛮暴行提出严重抗议，并坚决要求你立即下令撤销对罗森堡夫妇的非法判决，并恢复他们的自由，否则美国政府将不能逃脱其残害无辜人民的责任。
