    A Brief Review of Party Life

    Resolutely Struggle Against Illegal and Disciplined Behavior

    The errors of Wang Zhenhai, the former Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, as revealed in the letter from Comrade Fan Wenxing, former Deputy Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee, are serious. This is an extremely shameful "anti-Party" crime. In order to shield his landlord father-in-law, Li Baixue, Wang Zhenhai stood on the landlord's position to counterattack the poor peasant group in Dongniu Village, Wuji County, and counterattack Li Xiaoliu, a Communist Party member who led the poor peasant group to resolutely fight the landlord. In order to achieve the goal of counterattack, Wang Zhenhai and his lover Zhang Ying also organized other members of the County Committee, such as Lin Dayu, who had lost their position, to help counterattack; they retaliated against Fan Wenxing, who was fighting against his illegal behavior, and condoned Lin Dayu and others in slandering Fan Wenxing's principled struggle as "wanting to usurp power"; they also used their power to coerce the Wuji County Party Committee and the Public Security Bureau to implement their wrong decisions; they also secretly replaced the Hebei Provincial Party Committee to blindly approve his power to kill Li Xiaoliu. All this shows that in order to safeguard the interests of the landlords, Wang Zhenhai tried his best to kill Li Xiaoliu, a Communist Party member who resolutely fought against the landlord class and contributed to the Party and the people's cause. Therefore, Wang Zhenhai's mistake should not be regarded as merely bureaucratic leadership or subjective one-sidedness in ideological methods, but should be regarded as a planned and organized criminal act of murdering good people.
    However, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee adopted a wrong attitude towards such a serious incident. At first, they irresponsibly approved Wang Zhenhai's conspiracy to kill Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu; later, some comrades of the Ding County Party Committee launched a principled struggle for the killing of Li Xiaoliu, and Fan Wenxing reported to the Hebei Provincial Party Committee on this struggle. Although the Hebei Provincial Party Committee sent people to investigate and clarified the truth of the matter, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee still delayed in handling it. The bureaucratic style of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, which blindly believed in cadres, lacked inspection, and could not distinguish between right and wrong, is serious. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee could not have been unaware of Wang Zhenhai's mistakes, but it did not seriously deal with them, which is obviously wrong. This is a right-leaning error in cadre policy. Therefore, a serious attitude must be taken towards people like Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying, and they must be resolutely expelled from the Party and punished according to law. People who colluded with Wang Zhenhai, such as Lin Dayu, should also be given strict punishment to educate the whole Party.
    The attitude of Comrade Fan Wenxing and Liao Dinglin and other comrades in adhering to principles and resolutely fighting against anti-Party elements such as Wang Zhenhai is correct. This is in line with the requirements of the standard of a Communist Party member. The Communist Party of China requires every one of its members to actively and self-sacrificingly wage a solemn struggle against all activities that undermine the unity of the working class and undermine the revolutionary cause from within and without. Therefore, we call on all Communist Party members to learn from Comrade Fan Wenxing's spirit of adhering to principled struggle, and to ruthlessly expose and criticize all the erroneous facts such as suppression of democracy, suppression of criticism, and violations of laws and disciplines within our Party, in order to further purify the Party organization and enhance the Party's combat effectiveness.

    和违法乱纪行为进行坚决的斗争
    中共河北省定县地委前任副书记范文兴同志来信所揭发的定县地委书记王振海的错误是严重的。这是一种极端可耻的“反党”的罪恶行为。王振海为了庇护地主丈人李白雪，竟站在地主立场上向无极县东牛村的贫农团反攻，向领导贫农团坚决与地主斗争的共产党员李小六反攻。为了达到反攻的目的，王振海和他的爱人张英还组织了地委会中其他丧失立场的分子林达宇等帮助反攻；对与他的违法行为进行斗争的范文兴施以打击报复，并纵容林达宇等污蔑范文兴的这种原则性的斗争是“想篡位”；还利用自己的职权，威逼无极县委及公安局执行自己的错误决定；还偷天换日地使河北省委盲目地批准他杀害李小六的权力。这一切说明了王振海为了维护地主的利益，处心积虑地从多方面要把这个与地主阶级坚决斗争的、有功于党、有功于人民事业的共产党员李小六置于死地。因此绝不应当把王振海的这种错误，看作只是领导上的官僚主义，只是思想方法上的主观片面，而应看作是一种有计划有组织的谋害好人的犯罪行为。
    但是河北省委对于这样严重事件却采取了一种错误的态度。他们起初不负责任地批准了王振海杀害共产党员李小六的阴谋决定；后来定县地委会的部分同志为了杀害李小六事件展开了原则性的斗争，范文兴向河北省委作了有关这一斗争的报告，虽然河北省委派人作了调查，弄清了事情的真相，但河北省委却仍然拖延未作处理。河北省委的这种对干部偏听偏信、缺乏检查、是非不分的官僚主义作风是严重的。河北省委对于王振海的错误不能不知道，却不作认真处理，这显然是不对的。这是一种在干部政策上的右倾错误。因此对于王振海和张英这样的人，必须采取严肃的态度，坚决地把他们开除出党，依法惩办。对于与王振海狼狈为奸的人，例如林达宇等，同样要予以严格的处分，以教育全党。
    范文兴及廖鼎林等同志能坚持原则，与反党分子王振海等进行坚决斗争的态度是正确的。这是符合共产党员标准的要求的。中国共产党要求自己的每
    一个党员积极地自我牺牲地和从内部到外部来的破坏工人阶级统一、破坏革命事业的一切活动进行严正的斗争。因此，我们号召所有的共产党员，都应该学习范文兴同志坚持原则斗争的精神，把我们党内的一切压制民主、压制批评和违法乱纪等错误事实，予以无情的揭发、批判，进一步纯洁党的组织，提高党的战斗力。
