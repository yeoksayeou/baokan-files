To the Editor:

Following the publication of the article "Party and Government Organizations in Nanjing Should Rationally Use Technical Personnel" in the People's Daily on December 17, 1952, and your letter and attachments of December 18, after consulting with relevant units, we are now responding as follows:

The Organization Department of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a preliminary survey after the first registration of technical personnel in June of last year. At that time, the city's production departments were undergoing production reform and launching labor competitions. The Municipal Enterprise Management Committee had just been established and urgently needed a group of cadres with technical knowledge to carry out this movement. As Lu Ping and his comrades had mostly been engaged in Party, mass, and administrative work since graduating from school and lacked practical production experience, it would be difficult for them to directly go to factories to master technology. Therefore, after research by the Municipal Committee, it was decided to transfer them to work in the office of the Municipal Enterprise Management Committee. On the one hand, this was for the needs of the production reform work; on the other hand, it would allow them to become familiar with the actual production situation in factories through production reform. Once the work concludes, they will be assigned to work in technical positions according to the original plan. The Organization Department of the Municipal Committee clearly explained this intention to them at the time, and they also expressed their agreement. Now that the production reform is nearing completion, we intend to assign them to technical positions as originally planned.

    中共南京市委会即将调鲁平等至技术岗位
    编辑同志：一九五二年十二月十七日人民日报登载了“南京市党、政机关应合理使用技术人材”一文后，又接你处十二月十八日来信及附件。经我们向有关单位了解后，今函复如下：
    中共南京市委组织部于去年六月份进行了第一次技术人员登记后，即着手初步调查。当时正值全市生产部门进行生产改革及劳动竞赛，市委企业管理委员会刚成立，急需一批具有技术知识的干部开展此运动。而鲁平等同志大部是从学校出来后即作党、群及行政工作，缺乏实际生产经验，直接下厂掌握技术较困难，故经市委研究确定调他们到市委企业管理委员会办公室工作，一方面为了生产改革工作的需要；另一方面亦可使他们通过生产改革熟悉工厂实际生产情况，俟工作告一结束即分配下厂工作。当时市委组织部曾明确将此意图同他们说清楚，他们亦表示同意。现在生产改革即将告一段落，我们拟仍按原定计划分配他们至技术岗位工作。  中共南京市委办公厅秘书室
