    First Survey
    Nanjing Geological School First Survey Team, Second Detachment Reporting Group
    We are students from the Second Detachment of the First Survey Team of Nanjing Geological School, and we have conducted our first surveying work in Shandong.
    Upon arriving at the work site, the first difficulty we encountered was the shortage of equipment. We did not have enough plane table instruments, and the few we had were very heavy. Each small team only had one theodolite, and the radius of curvature of the clinometers was also inaccurate. As a result, some people doubted whether we could complete the task, but our confidence was very strong. As one comrade said, "If we use good instruments but are careless in our measurements, the map may not be accurate. As for us, we will correct the instruments more often, and with our spirit of responsibility to the country and more effort than others, we can also do a good job." In this way, although the instruments were several times older than us, our measurement accuracy was seven times higher than required. Sometimes, comrades went out to observe during the day and came back to calculate at night. No one ever complained. The next day, tired bodies carried dozens of pounds of instruments again, climbing hundreds of feet to the top of the mountain to make observations.
    Several months have passed, and we have seen snow twice in Shandong. Our shirts have also been torn by sweat, the sun, and Shandong jujube thorns. But a new task has arrived: a factory is to be built in February 1953, and a map must be made immediately. Everyone wrote letters of determination to accept this new task. We know that the large-scale economic construction of 1953 requires preparatory work to be done in 1952. If we make the map now, construction can begin in 1953, allowing the country to move towards industrialization sooner.
    The new work site is a vast plain. The withered yellow willow leaves, the blackened tree leaves, and one village after another increased the difficulty of surveying. To get from one point to another, we had to cross the river. The comrades were unwilling to take a three- or four-mile detour to find a bridge. Regardless of how wide the river was, they unhesitatingly took off their cotton trousers and let the icy river water prick their thighs like needles as they waded through the river. After it snowed, the comrades holding the plane table had numb hands but still aimed the direction and measured the distance. The snow fell into their shoes, melted, and froze. Their feet were swollen, and their socks were frozen together with their shoes. They could barely take them off after warming them by the fire when they returned in the evening. The next day, they went out to work as usual.
    What power encourages us to do this? It is the beautiful and happy vision of the new China, and the current large-scale economic construction of the motherland. When we think that many large-scale factories will be built in these fields in the near future, how excited we are! We thank the Party for its education, which enables us to play a part in the construction of our motherland.

    初次测量
    南京地质学校第一测量队第二分队报道组
    我们是南京地质学校第一测量队第二分队的学员，在山东进行了第一次测量工作。
    到了工作地点，首先遇到的是仪器不足的困难。我们没有足够的平台仪，仅有的几架也很笨重，一个小队才有一架经纬仪，测斜仪的曲率半径也不准确。因此曾有些人怀疑我们能不能完成任务，但是我们的信心都很强，正如有的同志说：“用好仪器，要是测量马虎，图不一定正确，我们呢，多改正仪器，加上我们对国家负责的精神和倍于人家的劳动，那也可以做好工作的。”这样，虽然仪器的年龄比我们大几倍，但是我们测量的精度较要求提高了七倍。有时，同志们白天出去观测，晚上回来计算，从来没有人埋怨过，第二天，疲倦的身子又背着几十斤重的仪器，爬上几百尺的山顶，去进行观测。
    几个月的时间过去了，在山东我们已经看见了两次雪，我们的衬衣也已给汗、太阳和山东枣树刺破了。但新的任务来了，一个工厂一九五三年二月建设，必须立即制出测图。大家都写了决心书，接受这个新任务。我们知道，一九五三年的大规模经济建设，一九五二年必须事前做好准备工作。我们现在测了图，一九五三年就可动工，使国家早一点走向工业化。
    新的工作地点是一块广大的平地。那枯黄的柳叶，发黑了的树叶子和一个接一个的村庄，增加了测量的困难。从这点跑到那点，必须跨过河去，同志们不愿打三、四里路的圈子找桥，不顾河有多宽，毫不犹豫地脱下棉裤，让冰冷的河水像针一样向大腿刺着，从河水中淌过去。一到下雪后，掌握测板的同志手冻僵了，还是瞄方向，测距离；雪落到鞋子中，融解了，结了冰，脚浸肿了，袜子与鞋子冻结在一起，晚上回来后烤了火才勉强地把它们脱下来。明天还是照样地出去工作。
    是什么力量鼓舞着我们这样作呢？是新中国美丽的、幸福的远景，是当前祖国大规模的经济建设。当我们想到就在这田野里，在不久的将来即将建立起许多规模巨大的工厂时，我们是多么兴奋啊！我们感谢党对我们的教育，使我们能在祖国的建设中发挥一份力量。
