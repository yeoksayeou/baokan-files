    Suggest Organizing Archive Work Observation
    Editor: Archive work is an indispensable part of revolutionary work. Archives are like a mirror, reflecting the work situation and problems of an organization, an aspect, or a region. It can not only provide the leadership with a basis for decision-making at present, but also serve as necessary reference material for future work. Our country's large-scale economic construction has begun, and the tasks in archive work will inevitably be more arduous. However, the archive work of our national organs is not yet sound enough, especially the inconsistency in management methods and the difference in classification catalogs are major problems. For example, the archive classification catalog of the Anqing Special Office in Anhui Province has twenty-two categories and three "substitute characters," while the archive classification catalog of the Lu'an Special Office in Anhui Province has thirteen categories and four "substitute characters" (namely category, outline, item, section). The archive catalogs at the county level are even more inconsistent. Of course, except for some very cumbersome and unscientific methods, each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to improve archive work and unify archive management in order to achieve scientific management and adapt to the needs of national construction work. To this end, we suggest that relevant parties organize archive work observations: archive work observations should be carried out between provinces, between special zones, between counties, or between systems. Through observation, exchange archive catalogs, and exchange and summarize archive management experience. Guo Wei Li Zuolai

    建议组织档案工作观摩
    编辑同志：档案工作是革命工作中不可少的一部分。档案好比一面镜子，可以反映一机关、一方面、一地区的工作情况和问题。它不仅当前可以供给领导上作为决策的依据，更可以作为将来进行某些工作的必要的参考材料。我们国家的大规模经济建设已经开始，档案工作方面的任务也必然更加繁重。但是目前我们国家机关的档案工作，还不够健全，特别是管理办法的不一致和分类目录的差别，是很大的问题。例如安徽省安庆专署的档案分类目录有二十二类、三个“代字”，而安徽省六安专署的档案分类目录有十三类，四个“代字”（即类、纲、目、节）。县一级的档案目录更是不一致。当然，除了某些很笨重，不科学的办法以外，各有所长，各有所短。所以我们认为有必要改进档案工作，统一档案管理，以求达到科学化，能适应国家建设工作的需要。为此，我们建议有关方面组织档案工作的观摩：以省与省，专区与专区，县与县或系统与系统，进行档案工作观摩。通过观摩，互换档案目录，交流和总结档案管理的经验。郭威　李作来
