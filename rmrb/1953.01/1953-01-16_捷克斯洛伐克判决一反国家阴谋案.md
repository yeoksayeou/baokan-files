Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 12th: TASS reports: The Karlovy Vary State Court tried some anti-state criminals from January 7th to 9th. These criminals, under the orders of American terrorist organizations, carried out anti-state activities on Czechoslovak territory. They obtained important intelligence regarding Czechoslovakia's national economy, military, state security organs, and transportation, and helped traitors flee abroad.

One of the crimes committed by these bandits was driving a train from Prague to Aš into the American-occupied zone of Germany, near Selb, on September 11, 1951.

There were eleven defendants in the dock: František Šilhart from Prague, Václav Růžička, Jiří Dědeček, and Josef Radvanovský; Rudolf Prucha from Cheb, Jan Volprecht, Jaroslav Mazanec, Jiří Novák, and Irena Zelená; Josef Sršeň and Josef Kůtka from Karlovy Vary.

These defendants, hostile to the people's democratic system, committed acts of treason.

The first to be tried was Rudolf Prucha, formerly the manager of a restaurant in Cheb, who was an intermediary for illegal border crossings. His restaurant was a hiding place for anti-state elements and a central station for collecting intelligence for the American counterintelligence agency (American CIC) with which he maintained close ties. Prucha established an anti-state group in Cheb. The members of this group were: Jan Volprecht and Jaroslav Mazanec, formal agents of the American counterintelligence agency, as well as their accomplices Jiří Novák and other people hostile to the people's democratic state.

The Prucha group established contact with a similar spy organization established in Prague after February 1948 by agents of the American intelligence agency. The head of the latter was František Šilhart, a broker. Šilhart, along with Václav Růžička, a former important staff member of the National Socialist Party and an employee of the party's publishing bureau, and Dědeček, the now-dismissed head of the "Propag" organization, conspired to organize a spy network, gathering people who, like themselves, were obsessed with war and hoped to overthrow the Czechoslovak People's Government with the help of Western imperialists. Together with Radvanovský, the former director of the Czechoslovak State Railways, they prepared to establish an illegal organization called the "National Committee." Šilhart and his accomplices also prepared for the escape of the traitor P. Kinkel to foreign countries. Most of the information sent out by the Šilhart group concerned important sectors of the Czechoslovak national economy. They sent this information abroad, causing damage to Czechoslovakia's vital interests and defense capabilities.

Based on the prosecutor's recommendation, it was decided to postpone the trial of the defendant Radvanovský's case for future separate proceedings.

The defendant V. Šilhart, son of F. Šilhart, was one of the agents responsible for liaison between this group and various agencies of American espionage and terrorist centers. V. Šilhart was also an agent of the French intelligence agency. V. Šilhart illegally infiltrated Czechoslovakia with various espionage missions and escaped back with the help of Prucha's accomplices. The defendants J. Sršeň and J. Kůtka helped him escape. In order to enable V. Šilhart to cross the border, they introduced him to Karel Truksa, an agent of the American counterintelligence agency who was then working as a train dispatcher at the National Railway Administration in Cheb; subsequently, a train was driven away, and he escaped to a foreign country on this train. The American agent Truksa and Sršeň were the most active organizers of the train theft case. They acted on the instructions of the American espionage and terrorist center. Truksa, Sršeň, V. Šilhart, and other traitors carefully prepared this criminal act. They investigated the situation at the train station and purchased weapons, preparing to use them if they encountered resistance when driving the train away. The action of driving the train away was also approved by the American agents.

The defendant Sršeň received 70,000 crowns from the defendant F. Šilhart as compensation for his preparations for V. Šilhart's escape abroad.

The defendant Kůtka began his anti-state activities by distributing subversive pamphlets. He used his position as a court clerk and helped Truksa prepare to drive the train away. The defendant Irena Zelená, the mistress of the American agent Truksa, knowing that Truksa was an agent of the American counterintelligence agency, also helped him carry out anti-state activities. She helped Truksa obtain weapons and let him hand them over to the bandits.

The defendants were found guilty, and the sentences were pronounced as follows: F. Šilhart, sentenced to death; R. Prucha, sentenced to life imprisonment; Jan Volprecht, sentenced to 20 years imprisonment; Ja. Mazanec, sentenced to 15 years imprisonment; I. Novák, sentenced to 18 years imprisonment; V. Růžička, sentenced to 24 years imprisonment; I. Dědeček, sentenced to 16 years imprisonment; J. Sršeň, sentenced to 22 years imprisonment; J. Kůtka, sentenced to 20 years imprisonment; I. Zelená, sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. The property of all defendants was confiscated.

    捷克斯洛伐克判决一反国家阴谋案
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格十二日电：捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：一月七日到九日，卡罗维·发利州法院审讯了一些反国家罪犯。这些罪犯奉美国恐怖组织的命令，在捷克斯洛伐克领土上进行反对国家的活动；他们得到了关于捷克斯洛伐克国民经济、军队、国家治安机关以及运输方面的重要情报，并帮助叛徒逃往外国。
    这些匪徒所犯的罪行之一是在一九五一年九月十一日把布拉格—亚斯之间的一列火车开到了德国美占区的塞尔布。
    被告席内有十一名被告：布拉格的弗朗齐歇克·西尔加特，瓦茨拉夫·鲁齐茨卡，伊里·戴德茨和约瑟夫·拉德凡诺夫斯基；折布的鲁道夫·普鲁哈，杨·沃尔普雷赫特，雅罗斯拉夫·马扎湼茨，伊里·诺瓦克和伊琳娜·泽伦纳；卡罗维·发利的约瑟夫·斯尔森和约瑟夫·库特卡。
    这些被告仇视人民民主制度，犯了叛国罪行。
    第一个受审讯的是鲁道夫·普鲁哈，他原是折布一家饭馆的经理，他是非法越境事件的中间人。他的饭馆是反国家分子的隐蔽所，是为和他保持着密切联系的美国反间谍机关（美国反间谍队）搜集的情报的集中站。普鲁哈在折布成立了一个反国家集团。这个集团的成员是：美国反间谍队的正式特务杨·沃尔普雷赫特和雅罗斯拉夫·马扎湼茨以及他们的同谋者伊里·诺瓦克等敌视人民民主国家的人们。
    普鲁哈集团与美国情报机关特务于一九四八年二月以后在布拉格成立的一个类似的间谍组织建立了联系。后者的首脑是做掮客的弗朗齐歇克·西尔加特。西尔加特和前民族社会党的重要工作人员、该党出版局职员鲁齐茨卡以及现已解职的“普罗巴格”机构负责人戴德茨共谋组织一个间谍网，纠合一些和他们自己一样迷信战争并希望在西方帝国主义者的帮助下推翻捷克斯洛伐克人民政府的人们。他们与前捷克斯洛伐克国家铁路管理局局长拉德凡诺夫斯基一起准备成立一个叫做“民族委员会”的非法组织。西尔加特和他的同谋犯也为叛徒普·金克尔的逃亡外国作过准备工作。西尔加特集团发出的情报大半是关于捷克斯洛伐克国民经济重要部门的情报。他们把这些情报发往外国，引起对捷克斯洛伐克的切身利益和国防力量的损害。
    根据检察官的建议，决定把被告拉德凡诺夫斯基的案件留待将来单独审讯。
    被告弗·西尔加特的儿子维·西尔加特是在这个集团和美国间谍及恐怖中心各机构之间负责联系的特务之一。维·西尔加特同时也是法国情报机关的特务。维·西尔加特带着各种间谍任务非法潜入捷克斯洛伐克，并在普鲁哈的同党的帮助下逃回去了。帮助他逃走的就是被告约·斯尔森和被告约·库特卡。为了要使维·西尔加特能够潜越边境，他们把他介绍给当时在折布的国家铁路管理局当火车运转员的美国反间谍队特务卡雷尔·特鲁克萨；随后，一列火车给拖跑了，他就坐着这列火车逃往外国了。美国特务特鲁克萨和斯尔森是拖跑火车这一案件的最积极的组织者。他们是按照美国间谍恐怖中心的指示进行活动的。特鲁克萨，斯尔森，维·西尔加特和其他叛徒谨慎地准备这一罪恶活动。他们调查了火车站的情况并购买了武器，准备一旦开走火车遇到抵抗时拿出使用。开走火车的行动也取得了美国特务的同意。
    被告斯尔森从被告弗·西尔加特那里得到七万克朗作为他为维·西尔加特逃往国外进行准备工作的酬劳。
    被告库特卡以散布破坏性的小册子开始他的反对国家的活动，他利用他当法庭职员的地位并帮助特鲁克萨准备把火车开走。美国特务特鲁克萨的情妇被告伊琳娜·泽伦纳明知特鲁克萨是美国反间谍队的间谍，还帮助他进行反对国家的活动。她帮助特鲁克萨设法得到武器，让他把这些武器交给匪徒们。
    被告们的罪状成立，宣判如下：弗·西尔加特，处以死刑；鲁·普鲁哈，处以无期徒刑；杨·沃尔普雷赫特，处以二十年有期徒刑；雅·马扎湼茨，处以十五年有期徒刑；伊·诺瓦克，处以十八年有期徒刑；瓦·鲁齐茨卡，处以二十四年有期徒刑；伊·戴德茨，处以十六年有期徒刑；约·斯尔森，处以二十二年有期徒刑；约·库特卡，处以二十年有期徒刑；伊·泽伦纳，处以五年有期徒刑。各被告的财产均予没收。
