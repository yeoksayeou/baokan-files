Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 27th: According to TASS, hundreds of rallies and demonstrations were held across Italy on the 25th to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Italian Communist Party. Simultaneously, "l'Unità," the organ of the Italian Communist Party, published a commemorative edition of 1.5 million copies, chronicling the party's struggles over the past 32 years.

The commemorative edition of "l'Unità" featured an editorial signed by Luigi Longo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party. Longo stated: Thirty-two years ago, our party declared its establishment. From then on, the working class had an organization, a leader, enabling it to become the leading and driving force in the entire national life. After glorious struggles, sacrifices, and victories, the party now leads all healthy, constructive, and progressive elements in Italy.

The Christian Democrats not only want to oppress and humiliate this political and social force, not only want to reduce its seats in parliament through deception, but also want to prevent it from participating democratically in national life.

The government's electoral "reform" bill is clearly intended to ensure that the Christian Democrats obtain an absolute majority, thereby facilitating the formation of an alliance between the Christian Democrats and openly royalist and reactionary forces after the election. This legislative trickery has aroused not only the anger of the Communists and Socialists but also the anger of all honest and just people.

The Communist Party and the Socialist Party stand at the forefront of the movement protesting against the government's deception. The Communist Party is the representative and fighter for the Italian working masses' demands for democracy and renewal.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 27th: According to TASS, the movement against the Gasperi government's electoral "reform" conspiracy continues to flourish across Italy.

On the 25th, hundreds of protest rallies were held across Italy against the government's electoral "reform" bill. Pietro Secchia, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, spoke at a rally in Bologna, emphasizing that the struggle against the government's "deceptive laws" has only just begun, and the Italian people and their representatives will resolutely fight in the upper house of parliament and throughout the country. Luigi Longo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, pointed out at a rally in Milan that the number of Italian Communist Party members is now fifty times greater than when the party was founded in 1921. This force is capable of leading the people to fight against any attempt to rebuild fascist reactionary rule.

Many places have held strikes and demonstrations.

    意大利全国人民庆祝意共成立三十二周年
    反对加斯贝利政府法西斯法案的斗争继续发展
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利全国在二十五日举行了好几百处集会和示威，庆祝意大利共产党成立三十二周年。同时，意大利共产党机关报“团结报”发行了一百五十万份纪念特刊，介绍三十二年来党所进行的斗争。
    “团结报”纪念特刊登载了意大利共产党副总书记路易吉·隆哥署名的社论。隆哥说：三十二年前，我们的党宣告成立。工人阶级从此有了一个组织，一个领导者，从而得以成为整个国家生活的领导力量和推动力量。经过了光荣的斗争、牺牲和胜利以后，现在党又领导着意大利所有健康的、有建设性的以及进步的分子。
    天主教民主党人不仅想压迫和侮辱这种政治与社会的力量，不仅想用欺骗的方法来削减这个力量在议会中的席位，同时还想阻止它民主地参与国家生活。
    政府的选举制“改革”法案的用意，显然是要保证天主教民主党取得绝对多数，从而便利天主教民主党在选举以后和公开的保皇分子及反动势力结成联盟。这种立法上的骗局不仅引起了共产党人和社会党人的愤怒，而且还引起了一切诚实和公正的人的愤怒。
    共产党与社会党站在抗议政府骗局的运动的最前列。共产党是意大利工人群众要求民主和革新的代表和战士。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：反对加斯贝利政府选举制“改革”阴谋的运动，继续在意大利全国各地蓬勃发展。
    二十五日，意大利全国举行了好几百个抗议集会，反对政府选举制“改革”法案。意大利共产党副总书记彼特罗·谢嘉在波伦亚的集会上发表演说，强调反对政府“骗人的法律”的斗争不过刚刚开始，意大利人民和他们的代表还要在议会上院和全国各地坚决进行斗争。意大利共产党副总书记路易吉·隆哥在米兰的集会上指出：意大利共产党党员的数目已经比一九二一年建党时大五十倍。这个力量能够领导人民向任何要重建法西斯反动统治的企图作斗争。
    许多地方都举行了罢工和示威游行。
