    Feidong County People's Government Should Persuade Farmers Not to Blindly Migrate to Cities

    Editor: Recently, many farmers in Feidong County, Anhui Province, have been blindly migrating to cities. In previous years, farmers here often went to the cities after the autumn harvest and returned during the busy farming season. This year, they heard that the country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, so even more farmers are flowing into the cities. According to incomplete statistics from four townships in Dianping District, including Jianshe, Minzhu, and Tuanjie, 531 farmers went to the cities to find work after last year's autumn harvest. In some places, more than 100 people left from a single village. Some local people's governments not only fail to persuade and dissuade these farmers who blindly flow into the cities, but also adopt an irresponsible attitude, casually issuing letters of introduction or migration certificates, which has fueled the incorrect sentiment of farmers blindly migrating to the cities, causing undue economic losses to the country and the farmers themselves. Sun Xushen and more than a dozen other farmers from Wangli Village borrowed money from all over to scrape together travel expenses to find work in Hefei, Nanjing, and other places. They traveled everywhere but could not find work, so they had to go back, wasting a lot of money and delaying production. Many farmers are less enthusiastic about farming in order to find work in the cities. Some farmers simply hand over their land to others to cultivate on their behalf and go to the cities to make a living. For example, Wang Shengye, a farmer from Wulijing Natural Village in Jianshe Township, has more than ten mu of land. Last spring, he went to Shanghai to find work and handed over his land to others to cultivate on his behalf. After he left, no one was willing to cultivate it for him, so these more than ten mu of land have been deserted and have not been cultivated to this day. This is very detrimental to rural production. I hope that the Feidong County People's Government will pay attention to the farmers who are blindly migrating to the cities, vigorously persuade and educate them to reassure them to concentrate on production, and take effective measures to solve the problem of surplus rural labor according to the specific circumstances of various local economic construction projects.

### 肥东县人民政府应说服农民不要盲目向城市流动

    肥东县人民政府应说服农民不要盲目向城市流动
    编辑同志：近来安徽省肥东县有很多农民盲目向城市流动。往年这里的农民就常常在秋收以后跑到城市，农忙时再跑回来，今年，他们听说国家开展大规模经济建设，因此流入城市的农民更加多了。据店坪区建设、民主、团结等四个乡不完全的统计，在去年秋收后跑到城市去找工作的农民有五百三十一人，有的地方一个村就走一百多人。对于这些盲目流入城市的农民，有些地方人民政府不但不加以说服和劝阻，反而采取不负责任的态度，随便给他们开证明信或迁移证，以致助长了农民盲目向城市流动的不正确情绪，造成国家和农民本身经济上不应有的损失。汪李村孙序深等十多个农民，东借西凑了几个盘缠钱跑到合肥、南京等地找工作做。他们到处流动都没有找着工作，只好再跑回去，浪费了很多钱又耽误了生产。不少农民为了到城市里找工作，对种地就劲头不大，有的农民干脆把地交给别人代种，自己跑到城市去谋生。如建设乡五里井自然村农民王盛业，家有十多亩田，去年春天他到上海去找工作，把地交给别人代种，他走后别人不愿为他代种，因此这十多亩田荒废至今还没有耕作。这样，对于农村的生产是很不利的。我希望肥东县人民政府注意对盲目向城市流动的农民，大力说服教育，使其安心生产，并且根据当地各种经济建设的具体情况，采取有效措施解决农村剩余劳动力的问题。　吴伟
