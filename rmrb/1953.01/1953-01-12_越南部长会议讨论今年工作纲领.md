Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, January 10th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a ministerial council meeting at the end of 1952. The meeting heard a report from General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, on the recent great victories in Northwest Vietnam and the Northern Vietnamese plains, reviewed the work of 1952, and discussed the work program for 1953.

The meeting considered that the recent victories in Northwest Vietnam were of extremely great significance. These victories demonstrated the political, tactical, and technical progress of the Vietnamese people after the recent ideological transformation movement.

When discussing the work program for 1953, the meeting pointed out that the Vietnamese people have achieved many brilliant victories, and the war of resistance is advancing by leaps and bounds. However, the more severe the enemy's defeats, the more frantically they will struggle. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance is bound to be victorious, but it will be a long and arduous struggle. In order to overcome difficulties and lay the foundation for a general counter-offensive and final victory, the Vietnamese people should strengthen their forces of resistance. Therefore, in 1953, the Vietnamese People's Government will resolutely carry out the following tasks: 1. Mobilize the masses to implement the government's land policy in a step-by-step manner, so that the peasants' reasonable economic demands are met and they obtain their due political status, thereby reorganizing farmers' associations, government, and people's organizations, and expanding and consolidating the National United Front. 2. Appropriately meet the needs of the army, improve the living standards of the army, and at the same time implement the work of giving preferential treatment to military families, the wounded, and the families of martyrs. 3. Correctly implement the policy of issuing increased production bonuses to workers. 4. Encourage and guide the industrial and commercial sectors to develop commerce, light industry, and handicrafts. 5. Improve the lives of cadres. 6. Correctly implement the policies of the Vietnamese government, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese National United Front towards ethnic minorities, strengthen unity and mutual assistance, and guarantee the equal rights of all ethnic groups. 7. Consolidate the newly liberated areas in all aspects, assist the people in making a living, and restore their economy that has been destroyed by the enemy.

    越南部长会议讨论今年工作纲领
    【新华社十一日讯】越南通讯社北越十日讯：越南民主共和国政府在一九五二年年底举行了部长会议。会议听取了越南人民军总司令武元甲将军关于最近在越南西北部和北越平原大胜利的报告，检查了一九五二年的工作，并讨论了一九五三年的工作纲领。
    会议认为最近越南西北部的胜利具有极重大的意义。这些胜利证明了越南人民经过在最近进行的思想改造运动后，在政治上、战术上和技术上的进步。
    会议在讨论一九五三年的工作纲领时指出：越南人民已取得很多辉煌的胜利，抗战事业正大踏步向前迈进。但是，敌人遭受的失败愈惨重，他们也就愈疯狂挣扎。越南人民抗战必定胜利，但将是一个长期的艰苦斗争。为了克服困难，奠定实行总反攻和取得最后胜利的基础，越南人民应该加强抗战力量。因此，越南人民政府在一九五三年将坚决实行以下任务：一、动员群众有步骤地执行政府的土地政策，以使农民的合理经济要求得到满足，并取得应有的政治地位，从而改组农民协会、政府及人民的组织，扩大和巩固国民联合战线。二、适当地满足军队的需要，提高军队的生活水平，同时执行优待军属、伤员和烈属的工作。三、正确地执行对工人发给增产津贴的政策。四、鼓励并指导工商界发展商业、轻工业和手工业。五、改善干部的生活。六、正确地实行越南政府、越南劳动党和越南国民联合战线对少数民族的政策，加强团结互助，并保证各族人民的平等权利。七、在各方面巩固新解放区，协助人民谋生和恢复他们的被敌人破坏了的经济。
