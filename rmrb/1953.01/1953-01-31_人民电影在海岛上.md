    "Overcome difficulties, face the people on the islands," this is the battle cry of our film projectionist team. We often use this slogan to urge ourselves and encourage others. In the past two years, we have screened twenty films, including "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Universal Celebration," "Peace Defenders," "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "New Sons and Daughters of Heroes," and "Shangrao Concentration Camp," on the large and small islands along the Shandong Peninsula, totaling one hundred and sixty screenings, with 300,000 viewers. The audience consists mostly of fishermen living on the islands, except for a small number of naval soldiers. They see a movie on average once every month and a half.
    The film team's screening of movies on the islands has been warmly welcomed by the fishermen. Our boat was still floating far from the shore when the beach was already full of a dark mass of people waving and cheering at us: "The movie is here!" "Chairman Mao sent people to deliver movies!" Children excitedly cheered and ran around to deliver the news. As soon as we set foot on the island, old men with white beards, their eyes glistening with tears of gratitude, immediately asked, "Comrades! Is Chairman Mao doing well in Beijing?"
    The sun had just begun to set when the fishermen came from all directions, some climbing mountains, some taking boats. The militia, the women's youth team, row after row, marched majestically into the field, singing "Valiantly, with high spirits." The movie began to play, and the fishermen were very excited with each passing scene. Those who lived on the island for a long time saw from the movie that our motherland was so vast, rich, beautiful, and lovely. They saw the beautiful mountains and rivers, the cities and villages; they saw trains and cars speeding on land, and airplanes patrolling the sky, and they could not help but cheer. When Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the roar of the fishermen's cheers became even more turbulent and lasted for a long time.
    After the movie was over, the people were reluctant to leave. They warmly surrounded us, carefully looking at the movie projector and generator. They asked us all kinds of questions. One fisherman asked, "Comrade, will our island have this thing in the future?" Before I could answer, a fisherman standing next to him said very confidently, "Do you even need to ask! With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, are we still afraid that our island cannot be built as well as the city?" The children were even more innocent and lovely, they were so yearning for the mainland of the motherland! They asked about the situation of the country's construction, and the situation of students going to school. They hoped that after graduating from elementary school, they could go to middle school on the mainland.
    After watching the movie, the fishermen always compared their lives today with their lives in the past. A fisherman said, "Before liberation, we were like people without a country, fishing without nets, farming without land, it was really a dead end. After liberation, the People's Government led us to divide the land, lend us money for fishing, made new nets, and we have had bumper harvests for two years, and our lives are getting better day by day!" After watching the movie, the fishermen understood the importance of organizing. They actively organize the militia and cooperate with the navy to patrol the ocean. An old man on a small island wrote a letter to his nephew in a military cadre school the night after watching the film "Steel Warrior," encouraging his nephew to study hard and defend the motherland. Many women were deeply moved after watching the Soviet film "She Defends the Motherland," and they were determined to learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the heroine in the film.
    It is not easy to deliver people's movies to the islands. We have to overcome many difficulties, such as seasickness and vomiting, and carrying the 400-pound generator on and off the boat. Although we are not in good physical condition, we have unlimited power. We are confident in carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions: Literature and art should serve the workers, peasants and soldiers. We know that if we bow our heads in the face of difficulties, the people on the islands will not be able to see people's movies. Although we have not eaten well for a few days, or even gotten sick, when we see the excitement of the people on the islands, we happily carry the machine and insist on showing the movie immediately. The climate of the ocean changes quickly. When wind and rain come, we take off our clothes and untie the rain cloth on the quilt to cover the machine, preferring to get wet ourselves rather than let the machine get wet. Because we can persist in our work in this way, the people on the islands love and welcome us very much. The love and welcome of the people has also given us great strength. We will often go to the islands to show movies.

    人民电影在海岛上
    刘端理
    “克服困难，面向岛屿上的人民”，这是我们电影队的放映员们的战斗口号。我们经常用这个口号督促自己、鼓励别人。两年来我们在沿山东半岛的大小岛屿上放映了“中国人民的胜利”“普天同庆”“和平保卫者”“白毛女”“钢铁战士”“新儿女英雄传”“上饶集中营”等二十部影片，计百六十多场，有三十万观众。观众中除一小部分是海军战士外，绝大部分都是岛上的渔民。平均一个半月他们看到一次电影。
    电影队在岛上放映电影，受到了渔民们热烈欢迎。我们的船还飘在离岸很远的海上，沙滩上早就站满了黑压压的人群，向我们挥着手，欢呼着：“电影来了！”“毛主席派人送电影来了！”孩子们兴致勃勃地到处欢呼送信。我们一踏上岛屿，白胡须的老大爷们，眼里闪着感激的泪珠，劈头就问：“同志！毛主席住在北京挺好吧！”
    太阳刚刚偏西，渔民们有的翻山，有的坐船，从四面八方赶来了。民兵队，青年妇女队，一行接一行，唱着“雄赳赳，气昂昂”的歌曲，雄壮地走到场上。电影开始放映了，一个镜头接一个镜头，渔民们非常兴奋。那些长期住在岛上的人民，从电影里看到了我们的祖国是这么辽阔、丰富、美丽、可爱。他们看到秀丽的山河，城市和乡村；看到火车、汽车在陆地上奔驰，飞机在天空巡视，他们不禁欢呼起来。当毛主席出现在银幕上时，渔民们的欢呼的声浪，更加汹涌起来，久久不息。
    电影放映完了，人民还不愿回去。他们亲切地包围着我们，仔细地看电影放映机、发电机。他们向我们问长问短，有个渔民问：“同志，将来咱岛也能有这家伙不？”我还没来得及回答，站在旁边的一个渔民就非常自信地说：“这还要问！有了毛主席、共产党的领导，还怕咱岛上不能建设得同城市一样吗？”孩子们更显得天真可爱，他们是那样地向往着祖国的大陆啊！他们问祖国建设的情形，问学生上学校的情形。他们希望自己在小学毕业之后，能够到大陆上上中学。
    渔民们看了电影后，总是把自己今天的生活同从前的生活比。有个渔民说：“解放前，我们像没有祖国的人一样，打渔没网，种田无地，真是死路一条。解放后，人民政府领导咱们分了地，贷到了渔款，制了新网，两年都是丰收，生活一天天好起来啦！”渔民们看了电影，更懂得组织起来的重要性。他们积极组织民兵，配合海军巡视海洋。一个小岛上一位老大爷看了影片“钢铁战士”后，当晚写信给在军事干部学校的侄子，鼓励侄子好好学本领，保卫祖国。很多妇女看了苏联影片“她在保卫祖国”，深受感动，她们决心学习影片中的女主角的英勇斗争精神。
    把人民电影送到岛屿上，并不是一件容易的事，我们得克服许多困难，例如晕船、呕吐，搬运四百斤重的发电机上船下船等。我们虽然体质都不算好，但是我们有无限的力量。我们满怀信心地执行毛主席的指示：文艺要为工农兵服务。我们知道，如果我们在困难面前低头，岛屿上的人民就看不到人民电影。我们虽然几天没有很好地吃东西，甚至病了，但一看到岛屿上人民的兴奋情绪，我们便愉快地抬着机器，坚持马上放映。海洋的气候变化很快，风雨来了，我们便脱下自己的衣服，解开被包上的雨布，盖在机器上，宁肯自己淋雨，不肯让机器淋雨。由于我们能够这样坚持工作，岛屿上的人民才异常爱戴和欢迎我们。人民的爱戴和欢迎，也给了我们莫大的力量。我们将经常到岛上放映电影。
