Differences and Commonalities
    ——A Record of the World People's Peace Congress
    Yuan Shuipai
    Veteran peace movement fighters, like Italian Professor Donini, recalled events of twenty years ago in their speeches. In the 1930s, he, along with Gorky, Romain Rolland, Barbusse, and others, engaged in the movement to defend peace and culture. "We also held meetings back then, but they weren't as moving as this. Since joining the peace movement, I have never seen a conference as broadly representative as this one, where people of various political views and beliefs can fully and freely express their opinions."

    No wonder Ehrenburg, at the beginning of his speech, compared the peace movement to "thousands of rivers and streams rushing together to merge with it," a vast torrent that is "getting deeper and wider," forming the greatest movement in human history.

    The blue cloth on the rostrum was hung with four columns of national flags. Their number increased daily as the conference progressed, from more than seventy countries to eighty-five. Every day, new representatives stepped off planes, wearing the small yellow flowers presented by Austrian welcomers, and entered the venue. Every day, the Executive Chairman announced the names of newly arrived countries and invited the newly elected chairmen to take their place on the rostrum. The list of 150 members of the presidium read by Secretary-General Laffargue at the opening ceremony had increased to 194 by the time he reported the statistics at the closing ceremony late on the 19th.

    The breadth of representation and the grand scale of the conference can be seen somewhat from the figures reported by Laffargue.

    The number of attendees was 1,857, including 1,604 delegates, 102 alternate delegates, and 105 guests. By region, Africa and Australia had 96 people; the Americas had 293 people (including 23 delegations); Asia had 21 delegations, including 59 from China, 19 from North Korea, 11 from Vietnam, 30 from India, and 17 from Japan; the Soviet Union had 44 people, and the People's Democracies had a total of 138 people. Other European countries had 1,019 people. Several Western European delegations were particularly large, with 198 from Italy, 176 from France, and 152 from Britain.

    By profession: 326 workers, 55 farmers, 160 clerks, 75 technicians, 63 industrialists, businessmen, and landlords, 8 athletes, 19 musicians, 189 writers and poets, 20 actors and film workers, 56 sculptors, architects, painters, etc., 157 scientists and doctors, 94 teachers, 84 lawyers, 65 religious figures, 20 mayors and city councilors, 92 leaders of national organizations, 46 leaders of international organizations, 10 military personnel, and 46 politicians and members of parliament.

    178 journalists attended the conference, including 113 types of newspapers and 18 news agencies from 30 countries. The conference had more than 2,000 staff members, including 150 translators working in Chinese, German, French, English, Russian, Italian, and Spanish, and 80 stenographers and typists. The conference published bulletins in five languages ​​daily, received an average of more than 2,000 congratulatory telegrams per day, and the delegates stayed in 78 hotels, using a total of 55,000 meals.

    Among the delegates were veteran politicians in their seventies and eighties, such as former German Weimar Republic Prime Minister Wirth, who needed two people to help him on and off the podium; there were also young Venezuelan students, Hungarian football players, and Belgian motorcycle racers; there were leaders of current political parties, former speakers, ministers, mayors, and senators of parliaments, as well as photographers, housewives, and nurses; there were shepherds from the Andes and sailors from the Baltic Sea; there were Mexican generals and Czechoslovakian milkmaids; there were world-renowned writers Ehrenburg, Fedin, Aragon, and Simonov, poet Neruda, painter Rivera, as well as French wine merchants and Sicilian farmers; there were family members of revolutionaries, Mrs. Thälmann and Mrs. Fucik, as well as Brazilian film actresses and Romanian female textile workers; there were labor heroes who dug the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, as well as Italian counts and duchesses; there were devout religious figures and followers of vegetarian Gandhi, as well as wealthy factory owners and jewelers.

    Different social classes, lifestyles, and occupations, different philosophies, religious beliefs, and political inclinations. The political parties they belonged to were also different: Socialist Party, Labour Party, Social Democratic Party, Christian Democratic Party, Communist Party, Royalist Party… Some were ruling parties, some were opposition parties. The organization of many delegations themselves was also very broad. Indian delegation leader Kitchlew repeatedly mentioned that his delegation included all Indian parties and factions. Italian representative Sereni also said that the Italian delegation was extremely representative.

    Many of the delegates had been peace fighters for a long time, but many others had been outside the peace movement in the past, even harboring doubts and concerns about the peace movement. Therefore, some delegates called the conference "the Parliament of mankind." Indeed, this conference was worthy of being called a grand gathering of peace and unity for all mankind. It was different from the past Paris-Prague Congress and Warsaw Congress, but the scope of unity was even wider than these two.

    During the eight-day meeting, delegates made a total of more than two hundred speeches. Whether formal delegates, alternate delegates, or guests, all had the right to speak and vote. Their opinions were different, even contradictory, and they engaged in heated discussions and debates. However, in any case, no one attempted to impose their own opinion on others, nor did anyone force others to abandon their original views.

    As everyone knows, after the World Peace Council issued a declaration to convene the World People's Peace Congress, Italian Liberal Party member Nitti wrote to Professor Joliot-Curie to inquire about the issue of freedom of speech at the conference. Joliot-Curie sincerely assured him in his reply. When the conference ended, and the presidium invited Nitti to give the closing remarks, Nitti mentioned this at the beginning, saying that the promise made by Professor Joliot-Curie in his letter had been fully realized. He was very satisfied.

    The Italian Catholic Peace Movement Association, which had no organizational connection with the world peace movement in the past, also accepted the invitation of the World Peace Council this time and sent a representative, Mrs. Piazza, to participate in the conference. Some of her opinions, such as her views on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations, differed from those of the vast majority of delegates; some of the examples she cited were also completely untrue. However, her long speech was still listened to quietly by the delegates and was also published in the conference bulletin. The Vatican newspaper had predicted that Mrs. Piazza would not be able to speak, and the Holy See's "excessive concern" was clearly in vain.

    Of course, contrary opinions could also be freely expressed. Sereni, a member of the Italian delegation, made a tactful and serious criticism of some of the opinions of this Catholic.

    Many delegates disagreed with the views of pacifists, but the remarks of various pacifists could still be published. Pacifists were satirized as ostriches with their heads buried in the sand, but the British pacifist minister Harman believed that he was not an ostrich, but a realist, and his so-called realism included some distortions of the Soviet Union.

    A pacifist from the Belgian branch of the War Resisters' International seemed to oppose everything, both wars of aggression and wars of national independence; both capitalism and communism, and also the speeches of most delegates at the conference.

    Danish representative Mrs. Appel advocated the establishment of a "world government" organization. In his speech, Ehrenburg, on the one hand, expressed respect for scientists such as Einstein who advocated "world government," and on the other hand, sharply criticized this view. He reminded everyone that the war of aggression against Korea was carried out under the guise of the United Nations. But Mrs. Appel disagreed and still insisted on her own opinion. Finally, she said that although she believed that opinions were inconsistent, they could still be understood. Some delegates recited Persian scriptures on the podium, some delegates recited Shakespeare's works, some delegates flipped through law books and read legal clauses on the spot, and some quoted Schiller's poems – all with one common purpose, to explain that peace is everyone's wish.

    An Argentine representative praised President Perón, and a Brazilian representative happily stated that he was a good friend of President Vargas. Some people opposed Marx's theory, and some people praised Dostoevsky's idealist philosophy. Regardless of the opinion, as long as he also advocates using negotiation instead of force to resolve international problems, opposes war and supports peace, he can express his opinion on this free human podium. As Pierre Cot said, as long as one agrees with the peace movement on one or several things, one can work together for the common goal of saving world peace. As the Soviet "Pravda" said, "Political, economic, and religious differences are unimportant as long as there is agreement on such an extremely important issue as peace."

    The reactionary newspapers' incessant babbling that the peace movement is "Communist propaganda" and "attempts to subvert the government" has once again been exposed by the facts. Anyone can see that the opinions of the groups and individuals participating in this conference are very far from the views of communism.

    Even regarding the reasons why mankind needs peace, many delegates had their own favorite explanations. Indian Gandhians believe that if it is a rose tree, it should bloom roses, if it is a rose, it should emit fragrance, and mankind should be peaceful. Iranian Muslims quoted Allah's words: Mankind is like the fingers of one hand and must be united. Soviet representative Ali Sad quoted the verses of an ancient Azerbaijani poet to explain the necessity of peace: Humans are all birds in one nest, and all are illuminated by the sun. Representatives engaged in the movement to protect children said that the hands that slaughter Korean and Vietnamese children should be put down immediately. French writer Triolet sincerely said that she did not believe that the women sitting in the conference hall would one day become her enemies. Korean representative Kim Young-soo emotionally asked the following question in the name of the young widows and sad mothers of her country:

    "Why do you love your husbands, but the husbands we love must die at the hands of your husbands?"

    The calls for peace and opposition to war issued from this free podium, accompanied by its warm and loud echo – the applause of more than 2,000 people, spread throughout the spacious venue with its gilded roof and marble pillars time and time again. When the meeting closed, people from all over the world who had worked together for eight days, row after row, hand in hand, formed an inseparable chain, cheering, singing, kissing, for five minutes, eight minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes… and still could not stop.

    The solemn and simple rostrum had no decorations, only six evergreens and four pots of flowers arranged at the highest point. These did not need to be explained in any language. Mankind will forever praise this symbol of life and peace.

    分歧和共同
    ——世界人民和平大会记事
    袁水拍
    和平运动的老战士们，像意大利多尼尼教授，在发言中想起了二十年前的往事。在三十年代的时候，他和高尔基、罗曼罗兰、巴比塞等曾经一起从事保卫和平、保卫文化的运动，“那时候我们也开会，却没有这样动人。我参加和平运动以来，从没有见过一次会议像这次一样具有这样广泛的代表性，各种政治见解和各种信仰的人能够充分自由表达意见。”
    难怪爱伦堡在他的演说的开头，就把和平运动比喻作“千百条河流、小溪奔来和它汇合”的，“越来越深，越来越宽”的浩荡巨流，形成人类史上最伟大的运动。
    主席台的蓝色布幔上挂着四纵列的各国国旗。它们的数目随着会议的进行，每天增加，从七十多国增加到八十五国。每天有新的代表跨下飞机，佩戴着奥国欢迎者所送的小黄花，走进会场。每天，执行主席宣布着新到国家的名称，并邀请新推选出来的主席到主席台上去就位。大会总书记拉斐德在开幕时所宣读的一百五十人的主席团名单，到他在十九日深夜大会闭幕时报告统计数字，已增至一九四人。
    代表的广泛性和大会的宏大的规模，从拉斐德报告的数字里可以看到一些。
    出席人数一八五七人，其中代表一六○四人，列席代表一○二人，来宾一○五人。按地域来分，非洲和澳洲九六人；美洲二九三人（包括二十三个代表团）；亚洲二十一个代表团，包括中国五九人，朝鲜一九人，越南一一人，印度三○人，日本一七人；苏联四四人，人民民主国共一三八人。其他欧洲国家一○一九人；有几个西欧国家代表团特别庞大，意大利一九八人，法国一七六人，英国一五二人。
    按职业来分：工人三二六人，农民五五人，职员一六○人，技术人员七五人，工业家、商业家和地主六三人，运动家八人，音乐家一九人，作家、诗人一八九人，演员、电影工作者二○人，雕刻家、建筑家、画家等五六人，科学家、医生一五七人，教师九四人，律师八四人，宗教界六五人，市长、市议员二○人，全国性团体的领袖九二人，国际性团体领袖四六人，军人一○人，政治家、国会议员四六人。
    出席大会的记者一七八人，包括三十个国家的一一三种报纸和十八个通讯社。大会工作人员二千余人，其中担任中、德、法、英、俄、意、西班牙文的翻译工作者一五○人，速记打字员八○人。大会每天出版五种文字的公报，平均每天收到二千多封贺电，代表分住七十八个旅馆，共用了五万五千份饭。
    代表中有七八十岁高龄的老政治家，像前德国魏玛共和国的总理维尔特，上下讲台要两个人扶着；也有年轻的委内瑞拉的学生、匈牙利足球队员和比利时摩托车选手；有现在政党的领袖，有过去议会的主席、部长、市长、参议员，也有摄影师、家庭妇女、护士；有安达斯山的牧羊人，也有波罗的海的水手；有墨西哥的将军，也有捷克斯洛伐克的挤牛奶女工；有世界闻名的作家爱伦堡、费定、阿拉贡、西蒙诺夫，诗人聂鲁达，画家里维拉，也有法国的制酒商、西西里岛上的农民；有革命家的家属台尔曼夫人、伏契克夫人，也有巴西的电影女演员、罗马尼亚的女纺织工人；有列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的挖土劳动英雄，也有意大利的伯爵和公爵夫人；有虔诚的宗教家和素食的甘地的信徒，也有富有的工厂主和珠宝商。
    不同的社会阶层、生活方式和职业，不同的哲学、宗教信仰和政治倾向。他们所属的政党也不相同：社会党、工党、社会民主党、基督教民主党、共产党、保皇党……有的是执政党，有的是在野党。许多代表团本身的组织也是很广泛的。印度代表团团长克其鲁一再提到他的代表团包括所有的印度的各党各派。意大利代表塞伦尼也说意大利代表团是有极大的代表性的。
    代表当中有许多是很久以来的和平战士，但也有不少是过去一直在和平运动以外，甚至对和平运动存在着怀疑和顾虑的人。因此，有的代表称大会为“人类的巴列门（按指议会）”。的确，这次大会足够称得起是全人类的和平大团结的会，它已经不同于过去巴黎——布拉格大会和华沙大会，而是比这两次所团结的范围更要广大了。
    八天会议中代表们一共作了两百多次发言。无论正式代表、列席代表还是来宾，都有发言权和表决权。他们的见解是不同的，甚至是相反的，他们进行着热烈的商讨和辩论。但，不管怎样，谁也没有企图把自己的一种意见去强加于别人，也没有任何人勉强别人放弃他原来的主张。
    大家知道，在世界和平理事会发出宣言召开世界人民和平大会以后，意大利自由党议员尼蒂曾致函约里奥—居里教授对大会的言论自由问题提出询问，约里奥—居里在复信中诚恳地加以保证。等到大会结束，主席团请尼蒂作闭幕辞时，尼蒂一开头就提到这一点，说约里奥—居里教授在给他的信里所许的诺言已经完全实现。他非常满意。
    过去在组织上和世界和平运动并没有联系的意大利天主教和平运动协会，这次也接受了世界和平理事会的邀请，派了代表皮雅佐夫人来参加大会。她的部分的意见，如对于朝鲜停战谈判中的遣俘问题的看法，是和绝大部分代表的意见不同的；她所举的某些事例，也毫无真实性。可是她的长篇演辞还是安静地被各代表听取了，也照样刊登在大会的公报上了。梵蒂冈的报纸曾经预料皮雅佐夫人不能发言，教廷的“过分的关心”显然落了空。
    当然，与她相反的意见也能够自由发表，同属于意大利代表团的议员塞伦尼就针对这位天主教徒的部分意见作了委婉的严肃的批评。
    好些代表不同意和平主义者的主张，可是各色各样的和平主义者的言论还是能够发表。和平主义者被讽刺为头藏在沙里的驼鸟，可是和平主义者的英国牧师哈尔曼却相信自己不是驼鸟，而是现实主义者，而他的所谓现实主义，就包括了对于苏联的一些曲解。
    代表反战国际比利时分会的一个和平主义者似乎对什么都反对，既反对侵略战争，也反对民族独立战争；既反对资本主义，也反对共产主义，也反对大会上大多数代表的发言。
    丹麦代表艾派尔夫人主张设立“世界政府”的组织。爱伦堡在他的发言中一方面对主张“世界政府”的科学家爱因斯坦等表示尊重，一方面也尖锐地批评了这种意见，他提醒大家说，侵略朝鲜的战争就是在联合国的伪装下进行的。可是艾派尔夫人不同意，依旧坚持自己主张。最后她说，她相信意见虽不一致，他们还是可以获得谅解的。有的代表在讲台上朗读波斯经文，有的代表背诵莎士比亚的作品，有的代表当场翻出法律书来念法律条文，有的引用席勒的诗句——只有一个共同的目的，为了说明和平是每一个人的愿望。
    一个阿根廷代表歌颂庇隆总统，一个巴西代表很高兴地表示自己是瓦加斯总统的好朋友。有人反对马克思的学说，有人赞扬杜斯退益夫斯基的唯心哲学。不管什么意见，只要他也主张用协商来代替武力解决国际问题，反对战争拥护和平，就都可以在这人类的自由讲台上发表意见。正如皮尔·戈特所说，只要在一件或几件事上赞成和平运动，就可以一起来为共同的目标——拯救世界和平——通力合作。也正如苏联“真理报”所说的，“只要在对和平这样极端重要的问题上意见是一致的时候，政治、经济和宗教的分歧就显得不重要了”。
    反动报纸所唠叨不休的和平运动是“共产党的宣传”，“企图颠覆政府”的滥调，再一次地被事实所揭穿。谁都会看到参加这次会议的团体和个人的意见是与共产主义的观点有很大距离的。
    即使对人类需要和平的理由，不少代表也都有他自己所爱好的解释。印度甘地主义者认为，是玫瑰树就应该开玫瑰花，是玫瑰花就应该发香，人类就应该和平。伊朗的回教徒引用阿拉的话：人类就像一只手的手指，必须团结。苏联代表阿里·萨德引用阿塞拜疆古代诗人的诗句来说明和平的必要：人类都是一个鸟窝中的小鸟，都被太阳所照耀。从事保卫儿童运动的代表说，屠杀朝鲜和越南儿童的手应该立刻放下来。法国女作家特丽奥勒真诚地说，她不相信会场中在座的妇女，有一天会成为她的敌人。朝鲜代表金英秀用她祖国的青年的寡妇和悲伤的母亲的名义激动地发出了这样的问题：
    “为什么你们要爱丈夫，而我们所爱的丈夫要死在你们丈夫手里？”
    从这自由讲台上发出的反对战争、要求和平的呼声，伴随着它的热烈的响亮的回声——二千多人的鼓掌声，一次又一次传遍整个金漆屋顶的大理石柱的宽广会场。当会议闭幕的时候，共同工作了八天的天南地北不相识的人，整排整排地手牵着手，结成不可分开的链子，欢呼着，歌唱着，亲吻着，五分钟，八分钟，十分钟，十五分钟……还不能停止。
    庄严朴素的主席台上没有任何装饰，只在最高处排列着六株长绿树和四盆鲜花，这些，是用不着任何一种文字来解释的。人类将永远赞颂这生命与和平的象征。
