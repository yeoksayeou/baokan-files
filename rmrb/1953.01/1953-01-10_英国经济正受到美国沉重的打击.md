    Xinhua News Agency, January 9th dispatch from Moscow: The "Izvestia" recently published an article by Antonov, pointing out that the contradictions between the United States and Britain in Southeast Asia are becoming increasingly acute. Antonov said: Since 1951, especially after the US government prohibited countries receiving US "aid" from exporting to countries in the democratic camp, the United States has greatly reduced its purchases of rubber, tin, and other strategic raw materials from countries in the British Empire, including Malaya. As a result, the prices of rubber and other raw materials plummeted. Thus, the decision taken by Britain under pressure from the United States not to export to countries in the democratic camp has dealt a heavy blow to the British economy.
    Due to the "embargo" imposed by the United States, the sales of Malayan rubber mainly rely on US purchases. However, these purchases are very unreliable, because the United States already produces 900,000 tons of synthetic rubber annually.
    American monopoly capital does not hesitate to take any means to drive Britain out of its traditional markets. American imperialists shamelessly take advantage of India's severe food crisis to break into the Indian market. In 1952, when India urgently needed funds to alleviate food difficulties, the United States suddenly reduced its purchases of flax, oilseeds, tea, pepper, and other items, which are the main items India exports to earn foreign trade income. This naturally caused the prices of these items to plummet in the domestic market, and then American companies forced India to sell flax at a price 57 percent lower than in 1951.
    Restrictive loans and "aid" are one of the methods used by American capital to break into India. In the past two years, India has received a total of 303.7 million US dollars in loans and "aid" from the United States.
    Antonov pointed out that American monopoly capital is using Japan as a battering ram in its struggle to seize the Southeast Asian market and drive British competitors out of the region. A special Japanese economic delegation recently visited Southeast Asian countries - Pakistan, Indonesia, India and Thailand. These delegations held negotiations with these countries on establishing closer economic relations with Japan. There is no doubt that these delegations are acting with the full consent of American monopoly capital, which has conquered the economy of occupied Japan.

### 英国经济正受到美国沉重的打击

    英国经济正受到美国沉重的打击
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“消息报”最近发表安东诺夫的文章，指出美国和英国在东南亚的矛盾正在日益尖锐化。安东诺夫说：自从一九五一年以来，特别是在美国政府禁止接受美“援”的国家向民主阵营的各国输出以后，美国大大减少了购买英帝国各国——包括马来亚在内——的橡胶、锡及其他战略原料的数量。因此，橡胶和其他原料的价格暴跌。于是，英国在美国的压力下所采取的不准向民主阵营国家输出的决定，便给了英国经济以沉重的打击。
    由于美国规定的“禁运”的结果，马来亚橡胶的销售便主要靠美国购买。但这些购买是很靠不住的，因为美国所生产的人造橡胶每年已达九十万吨了。
    美国垄断资本不惜采取任何手段以把英国赶出它的传统市场。美帝国主义者无耻地利用印度的严重粮食危机以便打进印度市场。一九五二年在印度迫切需要款项以减轻粮食困难的时候，美国突然减少了购买亚麻、含油种籽、茶、胡椒及其他物品的数量，而这些物品是印度输出以获得对外贸易收入的主要项目。这当然使这些物品在国内市场的价格大跌，接着美国公司便迫使印度以低于一九五一年价格百分之五十七的价格出售亚麻。
    束缚性的贷款和“援助”是美国资本打进印度的方法之一。在过去两年中，印度获得美国的贷款和
    “援助”共三亿零三百七十万美元。
    安东诺夫指出，美国垄断资本正在利用日本作为它在争夺东南亚市场和把英国竞争者从这个地区驱逐出去的斗争中的一个攻城锤。日本的特别经济代表团最近访问了东南亚国家——巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、印度和泰国。这些代表团和这些国家进行了关于和日本建立更密切的经济关系的谈判。毫无疑问，这些代表团是在美国垄断资本（它已把被占领的日本的经济征服了）完全同意下采取行动的。
