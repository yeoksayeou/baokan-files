    A Glorious Task - Going to Korea
    Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Second Delegation to Korea General Art Troupe
                    Director of the New China Pingju Opera Troupe, Li Zaiwen
    At the end of last year, the China Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued instructions on continuing to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, one of which was to call on theater troupes from all over the country to take turns going to Korea for one to three months of慰问 (weìwèn, "comforting") performances. Our opera circle has undertaken this glorious task, which is envied by many. I believe that the opera circles across the country have enthusiastically responded to this call and have begun to mobilize and prepare. Because I once participated in the Chinese People's Second Delegation to Korea to慰问 (weìwèn, "comfort") in Korea, I would like to introduce some of the situations of performing on the front line for the reference of opera workers who are preparing to go to Korea.
    The Volunteer Army comes from all directions of the motherland—excellent sons and daughters from various regions, cities, and towns. Therefore, various local opera genres in the country should plan to prepare to go to Korea to perform, bringing some "local dialects" to our "most beloved people". Whether it is a large-scale troupe or a small folk storytelling performance, the front welcomes them. Due to the victories of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies in more than two years of fighting, the Korean war situation has been completely stabilized, and supplies have been improved. One of the most obvious manifestations of the Chinese army's越战越强 (yuè zhàn yuè qiáng, "fighting stronger and stronger") on the Korean battlefield is that we have been able to allow large troupes to perform on the front lines in Korea. This time, our Pingju Opera Troupe had fifty people going to Korea. There were no difficulties in collective action and food and accommodation supplies, and there was not much difference from performing in China. Under the close cooperation and protection of the Volunteer Air Force, anti-aircraft units, and air defense sentries, we marched and performed day and night without feeling that we were on the most intense battlefield of modern warfare.
    Our performance theaters were built by the Volunteer Army comrades themselves. Some are in caves, and some are in well-hidden places. The largest cave can accommodate more than 800 audience members, and the smallest can accommodate 300 to 400 people. The caves I am talking about are not empty caves with snakes and tigers, but caves that are like ordinary theaters in Tianqiao, Beijing. The inside is arranged very well! The cave is more than three meters high, with瓦形铅铁皮 (wǎ xíng qiān tiě pí, "tile-shaped lead-iron sheets")架着 (jià zhe, "propped up"), and the walls and floors are nailed with企口木板 (qǐ kǒu mùbǎn, "tongue-and-groove wooden boards"), and filled with彩灯纸旗 (cǎi dēng zhǐ qí, "colored lanterns and paper flags"). The electric lights are so bright that you don't believe you are in a cave. Some units also implement reserved seating! The stage is also wide enough for actors and a dozen musicians to be on stage at the same time, and there is plenty of space. The backstage makeup and costume box positions are also very spacious, and seats are prepared for the actors to rest. Such good conditions are really beyond our expectations.
    The Volunteer Army's love for the motherland and the people of the motherland is indescribable. To the people from the motherland, they simply want to take out their hearts. Every time we arrive in an area, Volunteer Army comrades are already waiting there to welcome us. As soon as the car stops, the soldiers automatically rush to carry our luggage, costume boxes, and props, and even carry people away. The houses we live in are cleaned up two days in advance, and temporary sentry posts are added for guard. We sleep on heated kangs, and the bedding is well laid out. They also organized a reception committee to take care of us. Every day they ask us what dishes we like to eat, noodles or rice. Because the soldiers themselves raise chickens, pigs, and grow vegetables in their spare time from fighting, they can eat any kind of vegetable. We have four dishes and one soup for every meal. After the performance at night, they also prepare supper for us. The reception committee also established a health group, following us all day long, and if we have any headaches or fever, they will give us an examination and prescribe medicine. The comrades of the reception committee often tell us that they are afraid that we are too tired from performing and want us to rest. We said, "This time we came to Korea to perform to慰问 (weìwèn, "comfort") you, how can we rest?" They said, "Seeing people in blue uniforms is already very satisfying. If we keep asking you to perform and you get sick, how can we be worthy of the people of the motherland?" This most lovely and respectable sincere feeling is something we will never forget.
    After each performance by the art troupe of the慰问 (weìwèn, "comfort") delegation in each area, they always receive many letters from the soldiers, guaranteeing to eliminate more enemies to repay the people of the motherland and resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the people of the motherland. Therefore, our opera circles going to Korea to perform慰问 (weìwèn, "comfort") the Volunteer Army not only shows the love of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army, but also is an encouragement to the Volunteer Army's vigorous fighting spirit.
    Since liberation, our opera circles, under the education of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, have recognized the glory of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under the guidance of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and weed through the old to bring forth the new," an unprecedented flourishing situation has emerged in opera in various places. We all know that today's development of opera in various parts of the motherland is inseparable from the victory on the front line in Korea. After seeing countless atrocities of American imperialism in Korea with our own eyes, we deeply felt this even more. Therefore, we feel that opera serving the movement to resist America and aid Korea, especially performing in Korea, has the most significant meaning. This is a glorious task and a concrete manifestation of our opera circles' patriotism. Chairman Mao said: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and wholeheartedly for a long time, to the fiery struggle..." Let's go! Go to the Volunteer Army masses, go to the fiery Korean battlefield.
    The inadequacies in our Pingju Opera Troupe's performance in Korea this time are: 1. Too few programs, not enough preparation, and some programs lack strong political content. 2. Not bringing scenery made the performance atmosphere slack. Therefore, in the future, troupes preparing to go to Korea should prepare more programs, large and small. Because the "most beloved people" will ask for "one more". The program should preferably be rich in political significance and can play a role in encouragement and education. Based on our experience, it is best to bring软片布景 (ruǎn piàn bù jǐng, "soft scenery") when going to Korea, which can be folded and stacked, which is more convenient. You should also bring a few more curtains, and prepare two small carpets, put together to铺在地上 (pū zài dìshang, "lay on the floor"), which will have a greater effect on the performance technique. As for the transportation of props, there is no need to worry, the Volunteer Army comrades will fully help.
    I congratulate the glorious task of the opera workers who are preparing to go to Korea for慰问 (weìwèn, "comfort")! I wish you comrades victory!

### 光荣的任务——到朝鲜去

    光荣的任务——到朝鲜去
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团总团文工团副团长
                    新中华评剧工作团主任委员  李再雯
    抗美援朝总会在去年底发出了关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示，其中有一项是号召全国各地各剧团轮流去朝鲜进行一至三个月的慰问演出。我们戏曲界承担了这个光荣的任务，是被很多人所羡慕的。我相信全国戏曲界已热烈地响应这个号召，开始动员和准备起来了。因为我曾经参加中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团到过朝鲜，愿意介绍一些在前线演出的情况，给准备赴朝的戏曲工作同志们作参考。
    志愿军是来自祖国四面八方——各地区、各城市、各乡镇的优秀儿女。所以，国内各种地方性的剧种，都应该计划着准备去朝鲜演出，带些“乡音”给我们“最可爱的人”。不论是大规模的剧团或是民间小型的评说演唱，都是前方所欢迎的。由于中、朝人民军队两年多来作战的胜利，朝鲜战局已经完全稳定，供应已经改善。朝鲜战场我军越战越强的最明显的表现之一就是：我们已经能允许大剧团到朝鲜前线去演出了。我们评剧团这次赴朝的就有五十人，集体行动和食宿供应都没有发生什么困难，和在国内演出没有多大差别。在志愿军空军、对空部队和防空哨紧密配合的保护下，我们白天和黑夜一样行军、演戏，丝毫不感到是在现代化战争最激烈的战场上。
    我们演出的剧场是志愿军同志自己动手建筑的。有的在山洞里，有的在隐蔽良好的地方。最大的山洞能容八百多观众，最小的也能容纳三四百人。我说的山洞并不是四壁空空一无所有、蛰蛇宿虎的山洞，而是够上像北京天桥的一般剧场的山洞。里面布置得可好啦！山洞里有三丈多高，架着瓦形铅铁皮，四壁和地面都钉着企口木板，挂满了彩灯纸旗，电灯亮得你不相信是在山洞里。有的单位还实行对号入座制哩！舞台也是够宽大的，演员和十几位音乐工作同志同时上台，地方也很富裕。后台化妆和戏衣箱的地位也都很宽敞，还准备了演员休息的座位。像这样好的条件，真是出乎我们意料之外的。
    志愿军热爱祖国和祖国人民的感情，是难以形容的。对来自祖国的人们，他们简直要把心都掏出来似的。我们每到一个地区，志愿军同志早就在那里等着欢迎了。汽车一停，战士们都自动抢着替我们背行李，背戏箱、背道具，甚至把人都背着走。我们住的房屋，早两天就收拾好了，还临时加派岗哨警卫。我们睡的都是热炕，被服都铺得好好的。他们还组织了招待委员会，专门照顾我们。每天问我们爱吃什么菜，吃面还是大米。因为战士们在战斗之暇，自己养鸡、喂猪、种菜，所以什么菜都吃得到。我们一日三餐，每餐总是四菜一汤。晚上演完戏，还给我们准备夜餐。招待委员会还成立了卫生组，一天到晚跟着我们，有些头痛脑热的，就给检查配药。招待委员会的同志们经常对我们提出，怕我们演戏太累，要我们休息。我们说：“这次到朝鲜就是为演戏慰问你们来的，哪能休息呢？”他们说：“看到穿蓝制服的已经很满足了，老要你们演戏，累病了，我们怎么对得起祖国人民呢？”这种最可爱最可敬的真挚的感情，是我们永远忘不了的。
    慰问团的文工团在每个地区，每场戏演毕后，总会收到很多战士们写来的信，保证多消灭敌人来报答祖国人民，坚决完成祖国人民所交给的任务。所以，我们戏曲界到朝鲜演出慰问志愿军，不独表明了祖国人民对志愿军的热爱，而且也是对志愿军旺盛斗志的一种鼓舞。
    我们戏曲界在解放以来，在毛泽东文艺思想的教育下，都认识了为工农兵服务的光荣。在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的指示下，各地戏曲出现了空前繁荣的情况。我们都知道今天祖国各地戏曲的发展是和朝鲜前线的胜利分不开的。我们在朝鲜亲眼看到了美帝国主义的无数暴行以后，更深切地感到了这一点。所以，我们感到戏曲为抗美援朝运动服务，特别是赴朝演出，具有最重大的意义。这是个光荣的任务，也是我们戏曲界爱国的具体表现。毛主席说：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，……”我们去吧！到志愿军群众中去，到火热的朝鲜战场去。
    这次我们评剧团在朝鲜演出，工作中不够圆满的是：一、节目太少，准备不够，有的节目缺乏强烈的政治内容。二、没有带布景，使演出气氛松懈了。所以，今后准备赴朝的剧团，要多准备些节目，大小均可。因为“最可爱的人”会要求“再来一个”的。节目最好是要富有政治意义，能起鼓励和教育作用的。根据我们的经验，赴朝时最好是带软片布景，能摺能叠，比较方便，幕布也要多带几道，还得准备两块小地毯，拼起来铺在地上，对演出技术上的效果会更大。至于道具的搬运，那不用担心，志愿军同志会完全帮助的。
    我为准备入朝慰问的戏曲界同志们的光荣任务而祝贺！祝同志们胜利！
