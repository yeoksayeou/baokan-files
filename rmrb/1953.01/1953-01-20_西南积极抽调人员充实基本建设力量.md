Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 19th: The Southwest District's metallurgical, machinery, and electrical industries bureaus are actively implementing the policy of transferring personnel from production departments to augment the forces engaged in basic construction. In accordance with the needs of basic construction in 1953, they have essentially equipped the basic construction departments with technical personnel, administrative cadres, and skilled workers. The Southwest Metallurgical Industrial Bureau already possesses a relatively large basic construction team.

The work of transferring personnel from production departments by the various bureaus is being carried out under leadership, in a planned manner, and step by step. Before the end of last year, the bureaus convened basic construction conferences, clearly putting forward the policy of placing basic construction in a primary position, eliminating the idea of relying on superiors or personnel departments to send people, establishing the idea of self-reliance, and then formulating plans for transferring personnel.

In transferring personnel, the bureaus focused on resolving ideological problems such as "production will collapse after cadres are transferred" and "the task is large, the force is small, and we cannot transfer." The responsible cadres of each bureau and factory personally led this work, repeatedly emphasizing the great significance of basic construction, and pointing out that countless outstanding personnel have emerged in production over the past three years, and as long as they are boldly promoted, they can do a good job in production. The Southwest Metallurgical Industrial Bureau used practical examples for education in the transfer of personnel. For example, after the director of the blast furnace workshop of the 101 Steel Plant, who was a technical staff member, was transferred, production not only did not collapse, but the new acting director vigorously led production. In less than a month, the equipment utilization rate increased by 9% according to the plan, breaking the plant's historical record for highest daily output. This example solved everyone's ideological problems and ensured the smooth progress of the transfer of personnel.

In transferring personnel, all units paid attention to boldly cultivating and promoting workers and cadres, and opened a large number of training courses to cultivate reserve forces. The Southwest Metallurgical Industrial Bureau also paid special attention to the method of setting up more deputy positions. Most workshops in the steel plants promoted more than three sets of cadres to serve as deputies, from foremen, duty officers, and section chiefs to workshop directors and section chiefs. This laid the foundation for augmenting the forces engaged in basic construction. In order to continue to increase the strength of basic construction, the Southwest Electric Power Administration, based on the situation that the construction task is heavy and the strength needs to be increased, has adopted the policy of focusing on key deployment, preparing to equip several sets of cadres in key construction sites, and using the construction site as a school for cultivating basic construction talents. At the same time, it also requires the subordinate production departments to universally improve the level of engineers below the third grade to technicians by one level through production reform within half a year, to prepare for transferring a large number of cadres to the basic construction departments again.

### 西南积极抽调人员充实基本建设力量

    西南积极抽调人员充实基本建设力量
    【新华社重庆十九日电】西南区钢铁、机械、电业等工业管理局正积极执行从生产部门抽调人员增长基本建设力量的方针。他们按着一九五三年基本建设的需要，已基本上把基本建设部门的技术人员、行政干部、技术工人配备起来。西南钢铁工业管理局已经拥有一支比较大的基本建设队伍。
    各局从生产部门抽调人员的工作是有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行的。在去年年底前，各局都分别召开了基本建设会议，明确提出了把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，消除了依赖上级或人事部门派人的思想，树立了自力更生的思想，然后作出计划进行抽调人员。
    各局在抽调人员中，着重解决了“抽调干部后，生产要垮”、“任务大，力量小，不能调”等思想问题。各局和各厂负责干部亲自领导这一工作，反复强调基本建设的重大意义，并指出三年来在生产中已经涌现了无数优秀的人员，只要大胆提拔，他们可以搞好生产。西南钢铁工业管理局在抽调人员中用实际例子来进行教育。如一零一钢铁厂高炉车间调走了由技术人员担任的车间主任后，生产不但没有垮，新的代理人生气勃勃地领导生产，不到一个月的时间，设备利用率按照计划提高了百分之九，突破了该厂历史上最高日产量的纪录。这个事例使大家的思想问题得到了解决，保证了抽调人员的工作顺利进行。
    各单位在抽调人员中，注意了大胆培养与提拔工人和干部，并大量开办训练班培养后备力量。西南钢铁工业管理局还特别注意了多设副职的办法，各钢铁厂大部分车间都提拔了三套以上担任副职的干部，从工长、值班员、股长一直到车间主任、科长都有副职。这就为增长基本建设力量打下了基础。为了继续增长基本建设力量，西南电业管理局又根据施工任务重而力量还需要增加的情况，采取了重点配备的方针，准备在重点工地配备若干套干部，把工地作为培养基本建设人才的学校。同时，并要求所属生产部门在半年内，通过生产改革把三级工程师以下到技工普遍提高一级，作好再大量向基本建设部门输送干部的准备工作。
