    Yumen Oil Mine Completes 1952 Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

    Yumen Oil Mine has completed its entire 1952 annual production plan and increased production and conservation plan one month ahead of schedule. The main products, gasoline, exceeded the plan by 10.5 percent, kerosene exceeded by 18.9 percent, and heavy machine oil exceeded by 27.5 percent. It is estimated that by the end of 1952, in addition to completing the annual production tasks assigned by the higher authorities, the mine will have increased production and conserved wealth for the country by a total of 154.9 billion yuan. In order to reward the mine for its achievements in production, the Northwest Industrial Department issued a circular of commendation, awarded a silver tripod, a banner, and sent a telegram to congratulate all the employees of the mine.

    The reasons for Yumen Oil Mine's achievements are, first, that the Yumen Mining Bureau improved its management and administration, absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and Northeast China, grasped the central link of plan management, and carried out a series of work. On the one hand, factories and teams implemented monthly plans and production instruction charts, and through production meetings, turned plans into conscious actions by the masses, so that production could be carried out in a planned and rhythmic manner, and output and quality were improved. On the other hand, workshop cost accounting was implemented, which enabled employees to have a deeper understanding of the enterprise's economic accounting system, strengthened the concept of cherishing national assets, paid attention to conservation, and reduced costs. For example, after the refinery implemented workshop cost accounting, the actual cost was 12 percent lower than the planned cost. Secondly, the factories and teams of the mine enthusiastically launched a patriotic production increase movement with the promotion of advanced experience and rationalization proposals as the main content. From January to the end of October 1952, 2,513 rationalization proposals were adopted. The Wang Kuan team of the refinery created a "touring inspection system" with the main purpose of safe production. After its promotion, accidents were greatly reduced and output was increased. The boiler room of the oil production plant learned the touring inspection system and implemented a new tag-checking method, which completely eliminated accidents within three months. The Wang Dengxue team of the mine's drilling brigade also absorbed the spirit of the inspection method and set a "zoning and tag-checking method," achieving safe drilling throughout the month and improving drilling efficiency.

    玉门油矿提前完成一九五二年全年生产计划
    玉门油矿已提前一月完成一九五二年全年生产计划及增产节约计划。主要产品汽油超过计划百分之十点五，煤油超过百分之十八点九，重机油超过百分之二十七点五。预计到一九五二年年底该矿除完成上级交给的全年生产任务外，共可给国家增产节约一千五百四十九亿元的财富。为了奖励该矿在生产上获得的成绩，西北工业部特发出通报表扬，奖给银鼎一个，锦旗一面，并致电该矿全体职工祝贺。
    玉门油矿获得以上成绩的原因，首先是玉门矿务局改进了经营管理，吸取了苏联和东北的先进经验，抓住计划管理这一中心环节，进行了一系列的工作。一方面各厂、队实行了月度计划和生产指示图表，通过生产会议，把计划变为群众自觉的行动，使生产有计划有节奏地进行，提高了产量质量。一方面实行了车间成本核算，使职工对企业的经济核算制有了进一步的认识，加强了爱惜国家资财的观念，注意了节约，降低了成本。如炼油厂实行车间成本核算后，实际成本比计划成本降低了百分之十二。其次，是该矿各厂、队热烈地展开了以推广先进经验和合理化建议为主要内容的爱国增产运动。从一九五二年一月到十月底，被采用的合理化建议就有二千五百一十三件。炼油厂王宽小组创造了以安全生产为主要目的的“巡回检查制”，推广以后，事故大大减少，提高了产量，采油厂锅炉房学习巡回检查制，实行了新的挂牌检查法，在三个月内完全消灭了事故。该矿钻探大队王登学队也吸取了检查法精神，定出“分区和挂牌检查法”，做到全月安全钻进，提高了钻进效率。
