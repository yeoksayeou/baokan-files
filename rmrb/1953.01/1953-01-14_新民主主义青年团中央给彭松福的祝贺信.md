Congratulatory Letter from the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League to Peng Songfu

Dear Comrade Peng Songfu:

Just as the motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, is entering large-scale economic construction, you have meticulously created the "Rapid Training Method for Basic Lathe Operator Skills." This creation has opened up a shortcut for young lathe operators to learn skills, and it will greatly boost the confidence of young workers in quickly mastering technology. At a time when the great economic construction of the motherland is deeply lacking in skilled workers and technicians, your creation has made a beneficial contribution to the country's technical training work.

We sincerely congratulate you on your good achievements. We hope that you will continue to delve into this foundation, without arrogance or impetuosity, and strive for greater success.

Your spirit of working hard to educate young workers for the motherland is also a great encouragement to other technicians and technical personnel. We believe that, like you, they will enthusiastically and patiently teach their skills to young workers while doing a good job in production; and young workers will also humbly and diligently learn and master technology. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, let us build our motherland even stronger and more beautiful.

　With cordial greetings!

　Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League
　January 12

    新民主主义青年团中央给彭松福的祝贺信亲爱的彭松福同志：
    正当祖国在毛主席领导下进入大规模经济建设的时候，你精心创造了“车工基本技术速成教学法”，这个创造为青年车工的技术学习开辟了一条捷径，它必将大大鼓舞青年工人迅速掌握技术的信心。在祖国伟大经济建设正深感熟练工人和技术人员不足的情况下，你的创造为国家的技术训练工作作了一个有益的贡献。
    我们衷心地祝贺你的良好成就。望你在这一基础上继续深入钻研，不骄不躁，为争取获得更大的成功而努力。
    你为祖国而努力教育青年工人的精神，对于其他技术工人和技术人员也是一个极大的鼓舞。我们相信，他们将和你一样地在搞好生产的同时，会热情而耐心地将自己的技术教给青年工人；而青年工人，也将虚心刻苦地学习和掌握技术。让我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，把我们的祖国建设得更强大更美丽。　此致亲切的敬礼！
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会　一月十二日
