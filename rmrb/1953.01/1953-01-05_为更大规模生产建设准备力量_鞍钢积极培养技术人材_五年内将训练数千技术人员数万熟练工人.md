To prepare forces for larger-scale production and construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is systematically and extensively undertaking the work of cultivating and training employees amidst its intense production and construction efforts. According to the company's "Employee Five-Year Training Plan," within five years, it will train thousands of technicians and tens of thousands of skilled workers, and the cultural, scientific, and technological level of all employees will also be greatly improved. This will not only meet the needs of Anshan's production and construction in a timely manner, but also transfer a group of technical talents to other newly built steel plants in the country, making Anshan a base for cultivating technical talent for China's steel industry.

Anshan Iron and Steel Company established an Education Department in November 1951. Based on the requirements of Anshan Iron and Steel's future construction and development, and the current situation of its employees, the Education Department formulated the "Employee Five-Year Training Plan." The plan aims to train five thousand technicians and thirty thousand new workers within five years. Half of the technicians to be trained will be cultivated from workers. The plan encompasses over ninety types of technical categories for technicians and new workers to be trained in. At the same time, the plan also requires a significant improvement in the cultural, scientific, and technological level of the tens of thousands of existing employees. For example, the plan requires that most of the existing workers reach the level of a junior technical school (equivalent to junior high school) within five years; that the current illiteracy and semi-illiteracy rate of approximately thirty-three percent of all workers be reduced to the level of higher primary school within five years; that veteran cadres transferred from various revolutionary work posts to the industrial sector study basic industrial knowledge such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and then study university-level specialized courses, so as to gradually transform from laymen to experts; and that existing technical personnel with the level of secondary technical school (equivalent to senior high school) reach the level of university diploma within five years. Many will be promoted from technicians to engineers. Upon completion of the aforementioned plan, it will not only meet the needs of production and construction in a timely manner, but also fundamentally change the phenomenon of workers lacking culture caused by the former semi-colonial nature of the industry, and cultivate a group of technical talents and intellectuals from the working class, bringing about a major change in the existing level of production technology.

Based on the "Employee Five-Year Training Plan," Anshan Iron and Steel Company has further universally and extensively established various teaching institutions and many mass learning organizations on the original basis. These learning organizations can be divided into five categories:

(1) Regular Schools. Anshan Iron and Steel Company currently has seven regular schools, namely: a technical school, a cadre school, a medical assistant school, and four vocational schools. The technical school is a three-year school for training intermediate technical personnel, with more than 1,500 students. After opening the second technical school this year, the two schools can train more than 3,000 intermediate technical personnel within five years. Vocational schools train various new workers. The four schools currently have more than 1,700 students. Due to the different techniques learned, they graduate after studying for six months to one year. The largest of the four vocational schools newly built dormitories capable of accommodating 1,000 people last autumn, and will be doubled this year, with plans to accommodate 4,500 people by 1954. The cadre school is established to improve the business capabilities of existing accounting, statistics, materials, and other professional staff and general management cadres. There are not many students at present. It is planned to transfer nearly a thousand on-the-job personnel to the school for study this year, with each term lasting half a year. The medical assistant school trains general medical cadres, and currently has more than 300 students.

(2) Spare-time Schools. Anshan Iron and Steel Company currently has thirteen spare-time schools, namely: a veteran cadre refresher school, a technical cadre night school, a Russian night school, a spare-time medical school, four spare-time middle schools, and five spare-time technical schools. These spare-time schools are opened for workers, staff, technicians, veteran cadres, medical personnel, and other different learning objects. For example, more than 230 people participating in the veteran cadre refresher school are cadres who participated in the revolution before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and currently hold positions above the section level. They are studying higher primary school cultural courses and junior and senior high school courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry to further study specialized business. More than 400 people studying in the technical cadre night school are technical cadres promoted from workers, studying higher primary school, junior high school cultural courses, and intermediate technical school courses. More than 2,000 people studying in the Russian night school are mostly technicians and staff with a senior high school education. They first learn Russian to further study advanced Soviet technology. More than 700 people studying in the four spare-time middle schools are mainly staff, who are studying junior and senior high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and Chinese. Spare-time technical schools are opened for workers with a higher primary school education or above. More than 2,000 people are studying in these schools, learning junior high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and some technical courses. According to their progress, they can reach the level of a junior technical school in two years (studying ten hours per week). A total of more than 6,000 employees are participating in the thirteen spare-time schools. However, these schools are far from meeting the learning needs of employees. Last winter, the company built 60 new classrooms for spare-time schools, and the number of participants can be greatly increased. In order to enable employees to use their spare time to study higher education courses, the company is also preparing to open a night university.

(3) Opening Various Training Classes. The main training classes that have ended and are being opened last year are as follows: The first type is training classes for cultivating workers into technicians. The company plans to cultivate 2,400 to 2,500 technicians from workers within five years. The methods of training, in addition to sending more than 100 workers to the technical school run by the company, other domestic schools, or to study in the Soviet Union every year, most of them are trained by means of training classes and apprenticeship contracts in the units under the company. That is: gather workers who meet the training conditions, first learn junior high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and basic technical theory in the training class, and then go to the site and sign apprenticeship contracts with technical personnel to learn technical operations. Currently, four units of the company have opened such training classes, and nearly 200 workers are participating in the study. The second type is apprentice training classes. At present, the number of people accommodated by the regular vocational schools opened by Anshan Iron and Steel Company is not enough. Most new workers are trained by means of training classes. New apprentices who enter the factory learn the necessary technical knowledge in the training class for three to five months, and then sign apprenticeship contracts with veteran technicians on site to learn practical operations. After half a year to a year, the new apprentices can learn to become an eighth-grade technician. The third type is business training classes. This is opened by various units under the company to improve the business level of accounting, statistics, materials, and other professional personnel. This kind of training class has a great effect on improving department work and improving business management. The fourth type is advanced experience training classes. For example, basic construction, mining, iron smelting, steelmaking, transportation, and other departments have opened many training classes to learn advanced Soviet technology and promote important advanced experience in their departments. A total of more than 140 training classes of the above four types were opened in the ten months up to October last year, with nearly 7,000 participants.

(4) Apprenticeship Contracts. Anshan Iron and Steel Company is widely promoting the method of masters bringing apprentices to train various talents. Workers who want to become technicians or veteran cadres who want to learn technology can sign contracts with technical personnel; apprentices who want to become technicians can sign contracts with veteran technicians. At present, more than 3,000 such apprenticeship contracts have been signed. Anshan Iron and Steel employees are extremely serious when signing apprenticeship contracts. The contracts are jointly signed by the administrative负责人 of each unit and the master. In the implementation process, there are also special personnel to supervise and inspect. After the contract is completed, the administrative aspects must pay the master a certain remuneration. The company's Education Department is also preparing to launch technical personnel at all levels and technicians at all levels to sign mutual aid teaching contracts to accelerate the growth of technical forces.

(5) Various Spare-time Learning Classes and Study Groups. Most of these learning organizations are formed by employees themselves or with the strong help and support of the leadership. Learning is closely integrated with production, and workers learn what they need. For example, the workers in the woodworking class of the Mechanical General Plant particularly need mathematical knowledge, and more than 20 workers have organized their own spare-time mathematics learning class, inviting a technician from their department to be the teacher, using half an hour each in the morning and at noon to teach everyone algebra and geometry. Some technical learning groups teach and learn from each other, without a fixed teacher. The spare-time metallurgical learning class of the steelmaking plant is taught by a technician extracted by the administrative side, who teaches workers operating in three shifts every day. The above-mentioned learning classes and study groups have a wider mass character. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 300 classes and groups in the entire company, with more than 15,000 participants.

In total, more than 30,000 employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company participate in the above-mentioned various studies. This is a huge learning team, and they are overcoming the difficulties on the road to construction and marching towards culture, science, and technology.

    为更大规模生产建设准备力量
    鞍钢积极培养技术人材
    五年内将训练数千技术人员数万熟练工人
    【本报讯】为了给更大规模的生产建设准备力量，鞍山钢铁公司在紧张的生产和建设工作中，正有计划地、大规模地展开培养和训练职工的工作。根据该公司的“职工五年培养计划”，五年内，将训练出数千技术人员和数万熟练工人，所有职工的文化和科学技术水平也将大大提高一步。这样不仅可以及时满足鞍山生产和建设的需要，还可输送一批技术人材给国内其他新建的钢铁厂，使鞍山成为我国培养钢铁工业技术人材的基地。
    鞍山钢铁公司在一九五一年十一月设立了教育处。教育处根据鞍钢今后建设发展的要求和现有职工的情况，制订了“职工五年培养计划”。计划在五年内培养五千名技术人员和三万新工人。计划培养的技术人员有一半是从工人中培养。计划培养的技术人员和新工人的技术类别有九十余种之多。同时，计划中还要求大大提高现有数万职工的文化和科学技术水平。例如计划要求在五年内使现有工人大部分都达到初级技术学校（相当于初中）的水平；五年内使目前约占全部工人百分之三十三的文盲和半文盲达到高小水平；从各个革命工作岗位转到工业方面来的老干部，都要学习数学、物理、化学等工业基础知识，然后学习大学专科课程，以便逐步由外行变成内行；现有中级技术学校（相当于高中）水平的技术人员，要求在五年内达到大学专科的程度；有很多人要由技术员升为工程师。上述计划完成后，不仅可及时供应生产和建设的需要，同时将根本改变过去半殖民地性质的工业所造成的工人缺乏文化的现象，造就出一批工人阶级出身的技术人材和知识分子，使现有的生产技术水平发生重大的变化。
    鞍山钢铁公司根据“职工五年培养计划”，在原有基础上进一步普遍地、大量地建立了各种教学机构和许多群众性的学习组织。这些学习组织可以分为五类：
    （一）正规学校。现在鞍山钢铁公司共有七个正规学校，即：技术学校、干部学校、医士学校和四个技工学校。技术学校为三年制的培养中级技术人员的学校，现有一千五百余名学生；今年开办第二个技术学校后，两校可在五年内培养出三千多名中级技术人员。技工学校是训练各种新工人的，现四校共有一千七百多名学生，因所学的技术不同，分别学习半年到一年毕业。四个技工学校中最大的一个，去年秋季新修了容纳一千人的校舍，今年还要加倍修建，计划到一九五四年要容纳四千五百人。干部学校是为提高现有会计、统计、材料等各种专业职员和一般管理干部的业务能力而设立的，现有学生不多，准备今年抽调近千在职人员进该校学习，每期学习半年。医士学校是培养一般医务干部的，现有三百多学生。
    （二）业余学校。鞍山钢铁公司现共有十三处业余学校，即：老干部补习学校、技术干部夜校、俄文夜校、业余医务学校及四处业余中学和五处业余技术学校。这些业余学校是分别为工人、职员、技术人员、老干部、医务人员等各种不同学习对象开办的。如参加老干部补习学校学习的二百三十多人，都是在抗日战争胜利前参加革命、现任科级以上职务的干部。他们在这里分别补习高小文化课和初中、高中的数学、物理、化学等课程，以便进一步学习专门业务。在技术干部夜校学习的四百多人都是由工人提拔的技术干部，分别在学习高小、初中文化课和中级技术学校的课程。在俄文夜校学习的二千多人，大多数是具有高中程度的技术人员和职员，他们先学习俄文，以便进一步学习苏联先进技术。在四处业余中学学习的七百多人，主要是职员，他们在分别学习初中、高中的数学、物理、化学和国文。业余技术学校是为有高小以上文化程度的工人开办的。在这些学校里学习的有两千多人，学习初中的数学、物理、化学和一部分技术课。根据他们的进度，有两年时间（每周学习十小时）即可达到初级技术学校的程度。总计参加十三处业余学校学习的职工共有六千余人。但这些学校还远不能满足职工学习的需要，去年冬季，该公司又给业余学校新建了六十个教室，参加学习的人数还可以大大增加。为使职工能够利用业余时间学习高等学校的课程，该公司还准备开办夜大学。
    （三）开办各种训练班。去年已经结束和正在开办的训练班，主要的有以下四种：第一种是把工人培养成为技术人员的训练班。该公司计划在五年内要从工人中培养出二千四、五百名技术人员。培养的办法，除每年送一百多个工人入该公司办的技术学校、国内其他学校或送到苏联学习外，大部分还是在该公司所属各单位用训练班和师徒合同的办法进行培养。即：集中合乎培养条件的工人，先在训练班里学习初中的数学、物理、化学和本行基本技术理论，然后到现场和技术人员订师徒合同，学习技术操作。目前该公司有四个单位开办了这样的训练班，参加学习的工人将近二百人。第二种是徒工训练班。目前鞍山钢铁公司开办的正规技工学校容纳的人数还不够多，大部分新工人都是用训练班的办法进行训练。新进厂的徒工，以三、五个月的时间在训练班里学习必要的技术知识，然后到现场和老技工订师徒合同，学习实际操作。这样经过半年到一年，新徒工就可以学成一个八级技工。第三种是业务训练班。这是该公司所属各单位为提高会计、统计、材料等各种专业人员的业务水平而开办的。这种训练班对提高科室工作、改进经营管理有很大作用。第四种是先进经验训练班。如基本建设、采矿、炼铁、炼钢、运输等部门为学习苏联先进技术和推广本部门重要的先进经验，曾开办过多次训练班。总计到去年十月为止的十个月中，上述四种训练班曾开办过一百四十余次，参加学习的近七千人。
    （四）师徒合同。鞍山钢铁公司正在广泛推行师傅带徒弟的办法来培养各种人材。工人要学成技术员或老干部要学技术，可以和技术人员订合同；徒工要学成技工可以和老技工订合同。目前这两种师徒合同已签订三千多份。鞍钢职工签订师徒合同时极为认真。合同都由各单位行政负责人和老师傅共同签字。在执行中，还有专人进行督促检查。合同完成后，行政方面要付给师傅一定的酬金。该公司教育处还准备发动各级技术人员、各级技工分别订立互助性质的教学合同，以加速技术力量的成长。
    （五）各种业余学习班、学习组。这种学习组织多半是职工自行结合或在领导方面大力帮助和支持下组成的。学习密切结合生产，工人需要什么就学什么。如机械总厂木型班的工人特别需要数学知识，有二十几个工人就自己组织了业余数学学习班，请本部门的一个技术员当老师，利用早上和中午各半小时的时间，教大家代数和几何。有的技术学习小组是大家互教、互学，没有固定的老师。炼钢厂的业余冶金学习班则是由行政方面抽出一个技术员专任教学工作，每天分别给三班操作的工人上课。上述学习班和学习组具有更加广泛的群众性，据不完全统计，全公司共有三百多个班、组，参加学习的有一万五千余人。
    总计鞍山钢铁公司全公司参加上述各种学习的职工有三万多人，这是一支庞大的学习队伍，他们正在战胜建设道路上的困难，向文化、向科学技术大进军。
