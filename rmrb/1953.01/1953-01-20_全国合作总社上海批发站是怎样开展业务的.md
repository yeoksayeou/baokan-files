How the Shanghai Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives Conducts Business
　  Zhou Jun
    In order to guarantee and expand the sources of retail goods for grassroots cooperatives, reduce wholesale links and commodity circulation costs, so as to reduce costs and better supply the vast number of members with high-quality and inexpensive industrial products, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives decided in July 1952 to establish industrial product wholesale stations from top to bottom within the national cooperative system, based on economic zoning and in accordance with commodity circulation laws.

    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives first established an industrial product wholesale system in the economic zone centered on Shanghai.

    The Shanghai Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives was established in September 1952. Its task is to follow national economic policies, cooperate with local state-owned enterprises, and vigorously do a good job in supplying goods to lower-level wholesale stations. In the past few months, the Shanghai Wholesale Station has achieved some success in developing wholesale business and has created some experience.

    The Shanghai Wholesale Station first compiled a purchase plan and signed supply contracts with relevant units. This played a great role in ensuring the smooth development of business. According to the experience of the Shanghai Wholesale Station, the compilation of purchase plans should be based on the following materials: the general plan of the planning department of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives; typical survey materials of key areas; one's own experience in the process of commodity sales and daily accumulated materials on production and sales; and the purchase plans of representative typical provinces. Systematically studying the various needs of buyers is the basis for compiling purchase plans and organizing purchasing work. Because the purchasing power of the masses continues to increase with the development of production, their new demands for goods are also increasing day by day. If we do not constantly study the various needs of buyers, we will not be able to compile practical purchase plans.

    In order to ensure that goods are normally delivered from the place of origin to the retail network and quickly supplied to consumers, the Shanghai Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives shipped 85 percent of its goods directly from the place of origin to the wholesale stations in the sales area in October last year according to the distribution plan. In this way, 329 million yuan of transportation costs were saved in one month, and the transportation schedule was shortened, so that goods could be quickly supplied to consumers.

    The Shanghai Wholesale Station pays great attention to mobilizing all commodity resources and absorbing them into commodity circulation, thereby expanding the source of goods. The targets for mobilizing and organizing the source of goods at the wholesale station are three: (1) the products of handicraft production cooperatives and the vast number of small handicraftsmen in the economic zone to which it belongs, (2) industrial products produced by small and medium-sized factories in Shanghai, and (3) brand-name goods produced by large factories, which account for a very small proportion.

    Handicraft production still accounts for a considerable proportion of my country's economy. In order to fully meet the needs of its members, the cooperative must attach importance to purchasing handicraft products, and cannot simply purchase industrial products from large cities. The Shanghai Wholesale Station purchased 31.8 billion yuan of handicraft products in October last year, which accounted for 24.6 percent of the station's total purchases. This not only enriched the types of purchased goods, but also improved the sales of local handicraft products. The Shanghai Wholesale Station paid attention to organizing the production of small and medium-sized manufacturers in large cities when purchasing machine industrial products. The station ordered goods from 14 small and medium-sized manufacturers that had not established processing and ordering relationships with state-owned trading companies in October last year.

    According to the experience of various places, in order to ensure the specifications and quality of products and prevent inferior and non-standard goods from infiltrating the retail network, it is necessary to strengthen the inspection of goods. The Shanghai Wholesale Station initially neglected this work, allowing private manufacturers to take advantage of loopholes. For example, at the beginning of December last year, the station inspected the purchased knitwear and found that most of it did not meet the specifications. This fact shows that even after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, we should still be vigilant against the phenomenon of private industrial and commercial operators cutting corners. In the future, when cooperatives entrust processing, order goods, or purchase goods, they must carefully stipulate the specifications and quality of the goods, sign contracts with private manufacturers and strictly abide by the contracts. A "Detailed List of Commodity Specifications" should be attached when shipping goods for lower-level wholesale stations to check at any time. Only in this way can inferior goods be removed from the wholesale network.

    In order to strengthen the exchange of products within the cooperative and expand the source of goods, the Shanghai Wholesale Station held a production and sales symposium within the cooperative system. At present, the phenomenon of separation of production and sales within many local cooperatives and their disconnection from each other still exists. For example, sometimes supply and marketing cooperatives are unwilling to purchase products from handicraft production cooperatives, and production cooperatives have to sell them to the market. After they are sold, they are sometimes purchased back from the market by the supply and marketing cooperatives. As a result, the goods travel around and increase costs. In order to solve this problem, the Shanghai Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives convened a symposium in November last year with representatives from 32 handicraft production cooperatives in Shanghai and 31 provincial and municipal wholesale stations, and exhibited commodity samples. Representatives from wholesale stations in various places put forward opinions on the specifications and quality of handicraft production cooperative products, so that handicraft production cooperatives can improve production according to the needs of consumers; representatives of handicraft production cooperatives also reviewed the shortcomings of the past production orientation, which was geared towards cities and did not start from the vast rural areas. At this symposium, both parties concluded transactions on 24 types of goods on the spot, with a total value of more than 2 billion yuan. Wholesale stations in various places should use this form to organize the production and sales parties within the cooperative well.

    The establishment of wholesale stations by cooperatives according to economic zoning and wholesale according to reasonable commodity circulation laws can standardize the supply business of cooperatives. Cadres of cooperatives at all levels must recognize the progressiveness of this measure, fully attach importance to this work, and strive to implement this decision of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives.

    全国合作总社上海批发站是怎样开展业务的
　  周均
    为了保证和扩大基层合作社零售商品的来源，减少批发环节和商品流转费用，以便减低成本，更好地供应广大社员以物美价廉的工业品，全国合作总社在一九五二年七月间决定在全国合作社系统内，根据经济区划，按照商品流转规律，由上而下地建立工业品批发站。
    全国合作总社首先在以上海为中心的经济区域，建立了工业品批发系统。
    全国合作总社上海批发站是一九五二年九月间成立的。它的任务是：遵照国家经济政策，配合当地国营企业，大力作好对下级批发站的商品供应工作。几个月来，上海批发站在开展批发业务方面已取得了一些成绩，并创造了一些经验。
    上海批发站首先编制了进货计划，并与有关单位签订了供货合同。这对顺利开展业务起了很大的保证作用。根据上海批发站的经验，编制采购计划应当依据下列几方面的材料：全国合作总社计划部门的概略计划；重点地区的典型调查材料；在商品销售过程中自己的体会和日常积累起来的产销方面的材料；有代表性的典型省的采购计划。而有系统地研究购买者的各种需要，又是编制进货计划和组织进货工作的基础。因为群众购买力随着生产的发展不断提高，他们对商品的新的要求也日益增多，如果不是经常不断地研究购买者的各种需要，就无法编制切实的进货计划。
    为了使商品从产地正常地送到零售网，迅速地供应到消费者手里，全国合作总社上海批发站在去年十月份有百分之八十五的商品，按照分运计划，从产地直接运到销地的批发站。这样，一个月就节省了三亿二千九百万元的运转费用，并且缩短了运转日程，使商品能够迅速供应到消费者手里。
    上海批发站很注意动员一切商品资源，把它们吸收进商品流转中来，因而扩大了货源。该批发站动员与组织货源的对象有三个：（一）所属经济区域的手工业生产合作社及广大小手工业者的产品，
    （二）上海市中、小工厂生产的工业品，（三）占比重很小的大工厂出产的名牌货。
    手工业生产目前在我国经济中还占相当大的比重，合作社为了充分满足社员的需要，就必须重视采购手工业产品，不能单纯采购大城市的工业产品。上海批发站去年十月份采购了三百一十八亿元的手工业产品，这个数字占该站进货总额的百分之二十四点六。这样既充实了采购商品的种类，同时也改善了当地手工业产品的销售状况。上海批发站在采购机器工业品时，注意了组织大城市中、小厂商的生产的工作。该站在去年十月份即向十四家未与国营贸易企业建立加工订货关系的中、小厂商订了货。
    根据各地经验，为了保证产品的规格和质量，防止劣货和不合规格的商品渗入零售网去，必须加强对商品的检验工作。上海批发站开始对这一工作是忽视的，以致被私营厂商钻了空子。如去年十二月初，该站检验采购的针织品，发现大部不合规格。这一事实说明：虽然在“三反”、“五反”以后，仍应提防私营工商业者偷工减料现象的发生。今后，合作社委托加工、订货或收购时，必须周密地规定商品的规格质量，与私营厂商订立合同并严格地按照合同办事。在发运商品时应附带“商品规格明细表”，以备下级批发站随时检查。只有这样，才会把劣货从批发网中清洗出去。
    为了加强合作社内部的产品交流，扩大商品来源，上海批发站举办了合作社系统内部的产销座谈会。目前不少地方合作社内部产、销分家、彼此脱节的现象仍然存在。例如：有时供销社不愿采购手工业生产合作社的产品，生产合作社只好向市场推销，推销出去以后，有时却又被供销社从市场收购回来。结果造成商品旅行，加大了成本。为了解决这一问题，全国合作总社上海批发站在去年十一月份召集上海市三十二个手工业生产合作社和三十一个省、市批发站的代表开了座谈会，并展览了商品样品。各地批发站的代表对手工业生产合作社产品的规格、质量提出意见，使手工业生产合作社能按照消费者的需要改进生产；手工业生产合作社代表在会上也对过去的生产方向面向城市没有从广大农村出发的缺点作了检讨。在这个座谈会上，双方当场成交了二十四种商品，总值二十多亿元。各地批发站都应当利用这种形式把合作社内部的产、销双方很好地组织起来。
    合作社根据经济区划建立批发站，按照合理的商品流转规律进行批发，可以使合作社供应业务正规化。各级合作社的干部，必须认识这一措施的进步性，充分重视这一工作，为贯彻全国合作总社的这一决定而努力。
