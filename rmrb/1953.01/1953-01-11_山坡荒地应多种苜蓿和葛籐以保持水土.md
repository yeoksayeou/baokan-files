    Alfalfa and Kudzu Should Be Widely Planted on Barren Hillsides to Conserve Soil and Water

    Editor: Our Yiyang County in Henan Province has many mountains and little flat land. Not only are there no trees on the barren slopes, but even grass is scarce. Therefore, whenever it rains, a lot of mud and sand is washed away. This not only fails to conserve soil and water, but also, because there is little grass, we dare not raise many cattle. Last year, the people's government advocated planting alfalfa and kudzu vine (kudzu creeper) and provided seed loans. We benefited greatly after doing as the government instructed, and the soil erosion situation on the mountain land changed. Unfortunately, we planted too little this year. Alfalfa can not only conserve soil and water but also feed cattle. Kudzu is also very useful to us. It can be used as rope for building houses and tying bowls, and kudzu fiber can be twisted into thread to make shoe soles.

    These two things are of great benefit to mountain area production. We would like to tell the old folks in the mountain areas about the facts of our benefits, and hope that they will also plant these two plants on mountain land or steep slopes.

### 山坡荒地应多种苜蓿和葛籐以保持水土

    山坡荒地应多种苜蓿和葛籐以保持水土
    编辑同志：我们河南省伊阳县山地多，平川少，荒坡上不但没有树，连草也很少，因而每逢下雨，泥砂就被冲刷下来很多。这样不但不能保持水土并且因为草少，我们也不敢多喂牛。去年人民政府提倡种植紫花苜蓿和葛条（葛籐），并且贷给种籽。我们按政府的指示做了以后得利很大，山地的水土冲刷情况改变了。可惜的是今年咱们种的太少。紫花苜蓿既可保持水土，又可喂牛。葛条对我们也是很有用的，盖房、捆碗都可以用它当绳子，葛麻捻线还可做鞋底。
    这两件东西对山区生产的好处是很大的。我们愿意把我们受益的事实告诉各山区的老乡，希望他们也在山地或陡坡上种植这两种植物。
