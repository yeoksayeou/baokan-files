Northwest Region State-owned and local state-owned industries in 1952 increased production and saved the country more than 6,050 billion yuan (including a small portion of estimated figures), exceeding the original plan of 5,200 billion yuan by 16.3 percent. Through the increased production and economy campaign of 1952, the total output value of the region's major industries has exceeded the highest level before liberation by one to two and a half times, successfully completing the historical task of restoring production and transforming old enterprises, laying the foundation for large-scale economic construction.

In the process of completing the increased production and economy plan, all factories and mines have improved their management and administration. First, starting in the second half of the year, some factories and mines formulated monthly plans and submitted the plans to the masses for discussion, enabling the masses to directly grasp the plans. Most factories and mines also established a regular inspection system for the implementation of plans. Second, in May of last year, state-owned factories and mines completed the work of clearing assets and verifying funds; at the same time, independent accounting systems and enterprise bonus funds were implemented. Third, original records were rectified, and statistical work was strengthened. Fourth, cost accounting was improved. This played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the increased production and economy plan.

In 1952, factories and mines launched a mass-based rationalization proposal campaign and vigorously promoted advanced experiences. During the increased production and economy campaign, employees put forward a large number of rationalization proposals and created some advanced experiences.

Factories and mines have continuously improved employee welfare and safety facilities, which has continuously increased employee production enthusiasm. Based on the increase in labor productivity, the average wages of production workers in all factories and mines have increased compared to 1951. Under the supervision and assistance of labor departments and trade unions at all levels, all factories and mines carried out major safety and hygiene inspections, improved labor protection equipment, and formulated safe operating procedures. The principle of "prevention first" was implemented, and a patriotic hygiene campaign was launched, reducing the total number of patients by 7 percent compared to 1951. Significant improvements have also been made in labor protection and welfare. Employees' cultural life has also improved, and all factories and mines have established spare-time schools, promoted the rapid literacy method, and taught technical theoretical knowledge to improve employees' cultural and technical level.

Judging from the overall situation of the completion of the plan by factories and mines in 1952, there are still serious shortcomings, mainly the inability to complete the plan evenly and comprehensively. Most factories and mines did not focus on production during the "Three-Anti" campaign, resulting in a situation of being relaxed in the beginning and tight in the end, with heavy tasks in the second half of the year, and individual factories and mines even working overtime. The completion of production plans by factories and mines was relatively good, but capital management was not tightly grasped, and the Northwest Industrial Department's supervision and inspection were also insufficient. Therefore, the capital turnover plan was not fully completed.

Secondly, there was a great deal of blindness in carrying out creative invention and rationalization proposal campaigns. The leadership did not carry out rationalization proposal campaigns with specific goals based on the key problems and weak links existing in the enterprises. Therefore, although there were many rationalization proposals, they were not of great value, and the central problems were not resolved.

    西北区国营工业超额完成增产节约计划
    【本报讯】西北国营和地方国营工业一九五二年为国家增产节约了六千零五十多亿元（包括一小部分预计数字），超过原计划五千二百亿元百分之十六点三。通过一九五二年的增产节约运动，全区主要工业的生产总值，已超过解放前最高水平一倍到二倍半，胜利完成了恢复生产和改造旧企业的历史任务，为大规模经济建设打下了基础。
    在完成增产节约计划的过程中，各厂矿都改善了经营管理工作。首先，有些厂矿自下半年起订出月度计划，并把计划交给群众讨论，使群众直接掌握了计划。大部厂矿并建立了计划执行情况定期检查制度。第二，去年五月份，国营各厂矿都完成了清理资产核定资金的工作；同时实行了独立的会计制度和企业奖励基金制。第三，整顿原始记录，加强统计工作。第四，改进成本工作。这对保证完成增产节约计划起了不小的作用。
    各厂矿在一九五二年开展了群众性的合理化建议运动，大力推广了先进经验。在增产节约运动中，职工提出了大量的合理化建议，创造了一些先进经验。
    各厂矿不断改进了职工的福利和安全设施，使职工生产积极性不断提高。在劳动生产率提高的基础上，各厂矿生产工人的平均工资，比一九五一年都增加了。各厂矿在各级劳动部门和工会的监督与帮助下，都进行了安全卫生大检查，改进了劳动防护设备，制订了安全操作规程。贯彻“预防为主”的方针，开展了爱国卫生运动，使患病总人数比一九五一年减少百分之七。在劳保福利方面也都有了显著改善。职工文化生活也提高了，各厂矿都举办了业余学校，推广速成识字法，并教授技术理论知识，提高职工的文化和技术水平。
    从各厂矿一九五二年完成计划的全面情况来看，还存在着严重的缺点，主要是不能均匀地、全面地完成计划。多数厂矿在“三反”运动中，没有抓紧生产，形成前松后紧，下半年任务繁重，个别厂矿还加班加点。各厂矿生产计划的完成情况较好，但资金管理方面抓的不够紧，西北工业部的督促检查也不够，因此，资金周转计划全部没有完成。
    其次，在开展创造、发明和合理化建议运动中，存在很大的盲目性，领导上没有根据企业中存在的关键问题和薄弱环节，有目标地开展合理化建议运动，因而合理化建议虽多，但价值不大，中心问题未得到解决。
