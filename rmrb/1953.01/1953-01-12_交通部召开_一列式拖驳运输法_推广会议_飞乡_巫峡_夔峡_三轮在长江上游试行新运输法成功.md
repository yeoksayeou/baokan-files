    Ministry of Transportation Convenes Meeting to Promote "Single-Line Towing and Lighterage Method"
    Successful Trial of New Transportation Method on the Upper Yangtze River by "Feixiang," "Wuxia," and "Kuxia" Vessels
    In order to improve transportation efficiency and meet the increasing demands on transportation following the commencement of large-scale economic construction, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government recently convened a national promotion conference for the "Single-Line Towing and Lighterage Method" (i.e., single-line towing method) in Wuhan.
    The meeting concluded that towing and lighterage offers large transport capacity, low costs, and convenient dispatching and loading/unloading, while towboats and barges are inexpensive to build. Therefore, the meeting decided to extensively use towing and lighterage in inland waterway transportation in the future, and to promote the single-line towing and lighterage method in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    The single-line towing and lighterage method has been initially promoted on major inland rivers such as the Yangtze and Songhua Rivers, and has been successfully tested on the turbulent rivers of the Sichuan, Jialing, and Min Rivers. Shipping fleets implementing this method have seen a significant increase in transportation efficiency. The maximum towing capacity per horsepower has increased from two tons to 7.3 tons upstream, and from three tons to 24.2 tons downstream. However, some inland river fleets have not yet implemented it; and even those that have, have experienced a lack of coordination between transportation and navigation, engine maintenance, and scheduling because the leadership has not adapted to the improved transportation efficiency by promptly improving work in these areas. In order to effectively promote the single-line towing and lighterage method, the meeting decided: First, leading cadres at all levels must seriously study towing and lighterage knowledge and master the principles of the single-line towing and lighterage method in order to concretely lead the promotion work. Technical and administrative cadres in engine maintenance, navigation, scheduling, and supply must improve their work to effectively cooperate with the promotion work. Second, conduct a major inspection of all towboats and barges, improve and add machinery and equipment, and maximize the effectiveness of towboats and barges. Third, organize various fixed and auxiliary fleets according to ship performance and cargo sources, and use ships in a planned manner. Fourth, hold short-term training courses to train relevant personnel, especially technicians and crew members, to learn the basic principles of the single-line towing and lighterage method and advanced operating methods such as driving, engine operation, cable tying, and formation, to improve their professional and technical level. Fifth, rely on local governments to expand and consolidate cargo sources, and realize planned transportation in a step-by-step and planned manner. Sixth, strengthen political work, dispel the crew's ideological concerns such as fear of trouble, fear of responsibility, fear of hardship, fear of accidents causing shame, and fear of damaging the ship resulting in punishment; break down conservative ideas such as "reaching the limit" and fear of raising quotas. Advanced fleets and crew members should be rewarded and commended.
    This meeting was held from December 16 to 24, 1952. More than 120 responsible cadres, technicians, and representatives of advanced crew members from the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, Zhang Ce, the River Transport Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Communications, the National Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and inland waterway transportation management agencies of major administrative regions, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, and other units attended the meeting. Soviet inland river expert Romanov also participated in the meeting and gave a special report. At the meeting, representatives from various regions fully discussed how to promote the single-line towing and lighterage method, and Zhang Ce made a summary report. During the meeting, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, Hubei Provincial Shipping Company, and other units organized three fleets to conduct a practical demonstration of the single-line towing and lighterage method in Hankou Port. At the end of the meeting, thirteen prize flags were awarded to advanced fleets in various regions that actively promoted the "Single-Line Towing and Lighterage Method."

    The "Feixiang" vessel of the Chongqing Port Authority of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration and the "Wuxia" and "Kuxia" vessels of the joint state-private Minsheng Industrial Company have successively and successfully trialed the "Single-Line Towing and Lighterage Method" on the Yichang to Luzhou section of the upper Yangtze River. The more than 600-li waterway from Yichang to Chongqing on the upper Yangtze River is very dangerous, with the Three Gorges section being particularly winding and full of shoals, with rapid currents, making navigation very difficult. In the past, the Anglo-American "parallel method" was used, requiring a maximum of eight horsepower and a minimum of four horsepower to transport one ton of cargo. At the same time, because the towed barges using the "parallel method" had a large draft area and were subject to great resistance, each time they passed a shoal, they needed the help of a winch, which took 30 minutes, so the navigation speed was very slow. The "Feixiang" vessel, using the "Single-Line Towing and Lighterage Method," increased its load capacity by 25% upstream and 46% downstream compared to the old method. The "Kuxia" vessel, using the new method, was able to pass shoals without the help of a winch, taking only three to eight minutes each time, greatly increasing navigation speed. In the past, the vessel needed 35 hours to sail from Yichang to Wanxian, but now it takes less than 30 hours.
    The successful trial runs of the "Wuxia," "Feixiang," and "Kuxia" vessels have broken the conservative idea that "the single-line towing and lighterage method cannot be implemented on the upper Yangtze River," and have provided a good example for promoting the single-line towing and lighterage method in other rivers with dangerous waterways and rapid currents.

    交通部召开“一列式拖驳运输法”推广会议
    “飞乡”“巫峡”“夔峡”三轮在长江上游试行新运输法成功
    为了提高运输效率，满足大规模经济建设开始后对于运输方面日益增加的要求，中央人民政府交通部最近在武汉召开了全国“一列式拖驳运输法”（即一列式拖带法）推广会议。
    会议认为：拖驳运输运量大、成本低、调度装卸便利，拖轮和驳船造价低廉。所以会议决定今后在内河航运中大量运用拖驳运输，有计划、有步骤地推广一列式拖驳运输法。
    一列式拖驳运输法已经初步在长江、松花江等主要内河推广，并已在水流湍急的川江、嘉陵江、闽江试航成功。推行了这个方法的航队，运输效率显著提高，每匹马力的最高拖运量，上水由二吨提高到七吨三，下水由三吨提高到二十四点二吨。但有些内河的船队还没有推行；已经推行的内河，也因为领导方面没有适应运输效率的提高，及时改善机务、航务、调度等方面的工作，以致形成了运输和航务、机务、调度等方面工作不协调的现象。为了有效地推广一列式拖驳运输法，会议决定：第一、各级领导干部必须认真学习拖驳运输的知识，掌握一列式拖驳运输法的原理，以便具体领导推广工作。机务、航务、调度、供应等方面的技术干部和行政干部要改善本身工作，有效地配合推广工作。第二、对所有拖轮和驳船进行一次大检查，改进和添置机器设备，发挥拖轮和驳船的最大效能。第三、根据船舶性能和货源情况编组各种固定船队和辅助船队，有计划地使用船舶。第四、举办短期训练班，轮训有关人员特别是技术人员和船员，学习一列式拖驳运输法的基本原理和驾驶、轮机、结缆、编队等先进操作方法，提高他们的业务和技术水平。第五、依靠地方政府扩大和巩固货源，有步骤、有计划地实现计划运输。第六、加强政治工作，解除船员怕麻烦、怕负责、怕受累、怕出事丢人、怕坏了船受处分等思想顾虑；打破“到顶”、怕提高定额等保守思想。对先进船队和船员要进行奖励和表扬。
    这次会议是在一九五二年十二月十六日到二十四日召开的。出席这次会议的有中央人民政府交通部副部长张策和中央交通部河运管理总局、中国海员工会全国委员会以及各大行政区内河航运管理机构、长江航务管理局等单位的负责干部、技术人员、先进船员代表一百二十多人。苏联内河专家罗曼诺夫也参加了会议，并作了专题报告。会上各地代表对如何推广一列式拖驳运输法进行了充分讨论，张策作了总结报告。会议期间，长江航务管理局、湖北省轮船公司等单位组织了三个船队，在汉口港进行了一列式拖驳运输法的实地演习。会议最后以十三面奖旗奖给各地积极推行“一列式拖驳运输法”的先进船队。

    长江航务管理局重庆港务局的“飞乡”轮和公私合营民生实业公司的“巫峡”、“夔峡”两轮，先后在长江上游的宜昌至泸州段试行“一列式拖驳运输法”成功。长江上游从宜昌到重庆六百多里的航道很险，其中三峡一段多湾多滩，水流湍急，航行很困难，过去采用英美的“并列法”，运一吨货最多要八匹马力，最少也要四匹马力。同时因为采用“并列法”的拖驳吃水面积和所受阻力都很大，每次过滩都需要靠绞车帮助，需时三十分钟，因此航行速度很慢。“飞乡”轮用“一列式拖驳运输法”载重量上水比过去用旧法增加了百分之二十五，下水增加了百分之四十六。“夔峡”轮用新法航行，不用绞车帮助就上了滩，每次只需要三分钟到八分钟，大大提高了航行速度。过去该轮从宜昌到万县需要航行三十五小时，现在还用不到三十小时。
    “巫峡”、“飞乡”、“夔峡”三轮试航成功，打破了“长江上游不能实行一列式拖驳运输法”的保守思想，为其他在航道险、水流急的河流中推行一列式拖驳运输法提供了很好的榜样。（新华社）
