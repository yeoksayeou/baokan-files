To the Editor:

    Comrade Ju Zhilong's suggestion regarding the handling of the landlord class element Ou Xumei (formerly mistakenly written as Ou Zhumei) in the Pan Xiangqiu incident is very good. This shows that Comrade Ju has studied the case very carefully and is demonstrating responsibility to the people. Ou Xumei is indeed one of the principal culprits in the case. After the case was verified through investigation, Yuqian County had already expelled him and sent him back home, so when the Zhejiang Provincial Party and government organs discussed and decided on the handling of the case, they did not pursue Ou any further. Therefore, when the case was published in the newspaper, the handling of Ou was not mentioned. We hope to inform the readers of this situation.

    中共浙江省委纪律检查委员会的答复
    编辑同志：鞠枝隆同志对潘香球事件中地主阶级分子欧绪梅（前误为欧诸梅）的处理的建议，很好。这说明鞠同志对该案研究得很认真仔细，是一种对人民负责的表现。欧绪梅确是该案的主犯之一。当该案经检查证实以后，于潜县即已先将其开除回家，所以在浙江省省级党政机关讨论决定该案的处理时，没有对欧再追究。在报上公布该案时，也就没有提到对欧的处理。希望把这情况告知读者。
