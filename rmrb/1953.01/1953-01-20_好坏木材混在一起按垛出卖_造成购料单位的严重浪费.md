    Mixing Good and Bad Lumber for Sale by the Stack
    Causes Serious Waste for Purchasing Units
    Editor: I am a purchasing agent for the Capital Construction Engineering Department of the Logistics Production Department of the North China Military Region. In 1952, the lumber we used, in addition to that allocated by higher authorities, was purchased from the Tianjin Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company. The company stipulates that lumber must be purchased by the original stack and cannot be selected, but they do not stack the lumber according to grade, but mix good and bad lumber together. This has resulted in a huge amount of lumber used and a huge amount of loss last year.
    Last year, we purchased a total of 1,500 cubic meters of lumber from the Tianjin Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, of which more than 60 percent was rotten and did not meet the grade. For example, in August of last year, we purchased 270 cubic meters of inch boards from the company's lumber business office on Liuwei Road, of which 129.42 cubic meters were unusable, and the flames were not strong when burned. The lumber that has been used reluctantly is actually of lower quality than substandard lumber. This will inevitably affect the life of the building.
    This year is the beginning of the great construction of the motherland, and lumber is one of the main materials for construction, which is too important for buildings. It is suggested that the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company standardize the quality specifications of lumber, so that first-class lumber is first-class lumber, and the grade cannot be raised casually, and it cannot be for the sole purpose of profit.　Hu Zizhen

### 好坏木材混在一起按垛出卖  造成购料单位的严重浪费

    好坏木材混在一起按垛出卖
    造成购料单位的严重浪费
    编辑同志：我是华北军区后方勤务部军需生产部基本建设工程处的采购员。在一九五二年中，我们所用的木料除由上级调拨外，均向中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司采购。该公司规定购买木材时得按原垛买，不能挑选，但他们不是按照木材等级分别码垛，而是好的和坏的混合在一起。这样就造成我们去年一年木材用量庞大、损失数字也庞大的严重损失。
    我们去年在中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司共买木材一千五百余立方公尺，其中就有百分之六十以上是腐朽和不够等级的，例如我们去年八月份由六纬路该公司的木材经营处购进吋板二百七十立方公尺，其中有一百二十九点四二立方公尺不能使用，烧火火焰也不强。已经勉强使用了的木材，实际上质量还不及等外材。这样就不可免地要影响建筑物的寿命。
    今年是祖国伟大建设开始的一年，木材是建筑的主要器材之一，对于建筑物关系太重要了。建议中国煤业建筑器材公司将木材的质量规格标准化起来，一等材就是一等材，不能随便提高等级，不能以单纯营利为目的。　胡子珍
