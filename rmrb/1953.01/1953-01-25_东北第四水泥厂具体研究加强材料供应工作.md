    Northeast Fourth Cement Plant Specifically Studies Strengthening Material Supply Work

    Editor: After reading the criticism letter from Comrade Hu Feng published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on December 8th last year, regarding our plant's need to strengthen leadership over material supply work, we convened a professional meeting of relevant personnel from supply and marketing and warehousing on December 17th and 18th. We specifically studied how to strengthen the connection between warehouses and workshops, production and supply and marketing, and ensure that in the future, in addition to supplying materials according to the raw material supply plan, we will also go deep into the workshops to understand the actual consumption of raw materials, so as not to waste workers' time due to material requisition, or affect production due to insufficient material supply.

    We believe that this criticism and suggestion is basically correct and is of great help to us in improving supply and marketing work. However, some of the specific materials listed by the reader are slightly different from the actual situation.

    Regarding the shortage of pig iron and coke, after our investigation, there was no shortage of pig iron from January to December last year; and the reason for the shortage of coke was: In the production increase and economy movement, the mechanical workshop used scrap iron to produce sixty tons of pig iron balls, which used twenty tons of coke more than planned, so a coke shortage occurred at the end of November. After adding the budget, the result did not directly affect production.

### 东北第四水泥厂具体研究加强材料供应工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    东北第四水泥厂具体研究加强材料供应工作
    编辑同志：我们看到去年十二月八日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的胡峰同志对我厂应加强对材料供应工作的领导的批评信以后，曾于十二月十七、十八两日召开了供销与仓库有关人员专业会议，具体研究如何加强仓库与车间、生产与供销等方面的联系，并保证今后除了按照原材料供应计划供应外，并要深入车间了解原材料实际消耗情况，不使工人因领料而浪费时间，或因材料供应不上而影响生产。
    我们认为这一批评和建议基本上是正确的，对我们改进供销工作有很大帮助。但读者所列举的具体材料中，有的则稍有出入。
    关于缺少生铁和焦炭的问题，经我们了解，去年一月至十二月没有缺少过生铁；而缺少焦炭的原因是：在增产节约运动中，机务车间利用废铁倒出六十吨生铁球，这就超计划外多用了二十吨焦炭，所以在十一月末发生了焦炭缺少的情况。经过追加预算，结果还没有直接影响生产。
