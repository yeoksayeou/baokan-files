Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Outgoing US President Truman delivered his annual "State of the Union Address" to the US Congress on the 7th. Truman made a final "self-glorifying" show of his "achievements" in aggressive activities around the world and the frantic expansion of armaments and war preparations at home during his nearly eight years in office, and once again issued frantic war cries.

In the foreign policy section of the address, Truman vigorously boasted of the US government's series of foreign expansion, global war preparations, and initiation of aggressive wars from the "Truman Doctrine" to the Korean War. However, in this grandstanding, Truman could not help but admit two very important failures: Despite the United States' best efforts to interfere, its agent in China, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, still "failed." The American war of aggression against Korea has fallen into a "stalemate."

In order to conceal the aggressive and enslaving nature of American imperialist foreign policy, Truman vigorously promoted the so-called "aid" of the United States to other countries and hypocritically defended that the United States, in doing so, "did not attempt to dominate or control any country." But he could not change the fact that today, in Western European countries that have received US "aid," slogans that did not exist eight years ago are appearing everywhere: "Americans go home!" Even the British ruling group, which received the largest share of US "aid," is now saying that it wants trade and not this "aid" that deprives Britain of its sovereign independence.

In the domestic policy section of the address, Truman tried his best to portray the United States under his rule as a paradise of "prosperity" and "equal freedom." He made no mention of the fact that an economic panic, which even experts in the US government have already publicly admitted is unavoidable. As for the surging wave of workers' strikes and the fact that 13 million people were unemployed or semi-unemployed in the United States last year, he naturally dared not mention them.

The most prominent part of Truman's "State of the Union Address" this year was the new clamoring for atomic war. In the section of the address on so-called "atomic control," Truman collected all kinds of intimidating words such as "annihilation," "destruction," "devastation," and "leveling," and boasted of "new atomic weapons" to carry out blackmail. Truman shouted like a madman: "We are heading towards an unpredictable peak of destructive power." However, Truman could not hide his fear in his frantic shouts. He had to admit that war was no longer fun for the imperialists, and that launching a war against the socialist camp "will bury our (American) own society."

Truman finally asked the American people to make more sacrifices for the war policy. He said: "We have already had to sacrifice some jobs and lifestyles that we have become accustomed to... even lives. But if one thing is certain in the future, it is that we will have to make some sacrifices in the future." But no matter how Truman boasts about his policies and clamors for atomic war, it cannot change the fact that Truman's set of domestic and foreign policies and atomic blackmail policies have proven to be completely rejected by the people in last year's election. Truman has therefore failed to become president again.

### 在向国会发表的“国情咨文”中  杜鲁门再一次疯狂叫嚣战争

    在向国会发表的“国情咨文”中
    杜鲁门再一次疯狂叫嚣战争
    【新华社十日讯】即将下台的美国总统杜鲁门七日向美国国会发表每年一度的“国情咨文”。杜鲁门对他执政近八年以来在全世界的侵略活动和在国内疯狂扩军备战的“政绩”，作了最后一次的“丑表功”，并又一次发出疯狂的战争叫嚣。
    杜鲁门在咨文的外交部分中竭力吹嘘美国政府战后从“杜鲁门主义”到朝鲜战争的一连串对外扩张、全球备战和发动侵略战争的“成就”。但是杜鲁门在这样大吹大擂中却不能不承认两个非常重要的失败，就是：尽管美国竭尽了干涉之能事，它在中国的代理人蒋介石匪帮还是“败北了”。美国侵略朝鲜的战争已经陷于“僵局”。
    为了掩饰美帝国主义外交政策的侵略和奴役的性质，杜鲁门竭力宣扬美国对其他国家的所谓“援助”，并且欲盖弥彰地辩解说，美国在这样作时，“并没有企图统治或控制任何国家”。但他却无法改变这样的事实，就是：今天，在西欧那些接受了美国“援助”的国家，到处出现着八年前所没有的标语：“美国人滚回去！”连接受了美国“援助”的最大部分的英国统治集团，现在也在说要贸易而不要这种使英国丧失独立主权的“援助”。
    在咨文的内政部分，杜鲁门竭力想把他治下的美国描绘成“繁荣”和“平等自由”的乐土。对于甚至美国政府的专家也已经公开承认的经济恐慌已是不可避免的事实，却绝口不谈。至于美国去年风起云涌的工人罢工浪潮和一千三百万人失业和半失业的事实，自然更是不敢提及。
    杜鲁门今年的“国情咨文”中最为突出的地方是关于原子战争的新的叫嚣。在咨文关于所谓“原子管制”的部分，杜鲁门搜集了一切诸如“消灭”、“毁灭”、“破坏”、“夷平”等一类恫吓性字眼，并吹嘘“新的原子武器”来进行讹诈。杜鲁门像一个疯子一样地喊叫：“我们正向着毁灭力量的还不可预测的高峰奔去。”然而杜鲁门在发狂般的叫嚣中却掩盖不住自己的恐惧。他不得不承认，战争的火对帝国主义者来说已再也不是好玩的了，对社会主义阵营发动战争“将葬送我们（美国）自己的社会”。
    杜鲁门最后要美国人民为战争政策作更多的牺牲。他说：“我们已经必须牺牲一些已经习惯了的工作与生活方式……甚至生命。可是，假如将来有一件事是确定的话，那便是将来我们还要作些牺牲。”但是不管杜鲁门怎样吹嘘他的政策和叫嚣原子战争，也不能改变这个事实，就是：杜鲁门的这套内政外交和原子讹诈政策，在去年选举中已证明受到人民的彻底唾弃。杜鲁门已因此再当不成总统了。
