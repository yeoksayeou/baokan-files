Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 15th: A news communique released by the Central Headquarters of the Communist Party of India states: The enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India was held in Calcutta from December 31, 1952, to January 10, 1953. Attending the meeting were 79 people, including members of the Central Committee and representatives from party organizations in various provinces (states) of India. The meeting discussed the political situation in the past few months and the significance of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and welcomed Stalin's new work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

The meeting believes that, like the people of the world, the main task of the Indian people is to struggle for peace and isolate the adventurers within the imperialist camp.

The meeting decided to widely publicize the resolutions of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, believing that uniting the Indian people broadly based on these resolutions is one of the main tasks of the Communist Party of India.

The movement to strive for friendly relations between India and Pakistan for the peace and prosperity of the people of both countries will be an important part of the Indian peace movement. In addition to the general tasks of the world peace movement, movements must also be carried out against granting transit facilities to Nepalese Gurkha soldiers recruited by Britain and against France using Indian bases to carry out its war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. Such movements will be a special task of the Indian peace movement.

The meeting believes that India can only play its due role and make unremitting efforts to defend peace by breaking free from the shackles of the British Commonwealth, defending its freedom and sovereignty, and opposing the penetration of the United States in economic, political, and cultural life. The meeting discussed the task of promoting the national liberation movement; it also discussed India's growing economic crisis.

The Communist Party of India had already decided to do its best to form a united front with all democratic parties, organizations, groups, and individuals. This meeting reiterated this decision and reviewed the experience of various provinces (states) in establishing a united front after the Indian general election.

The meeting discussed the shortcomings in the party organization and has made certain decisions to further strengthen the party's organization and unity.

The meeting decided that the next All-India Communist Party Congress will be held in September 1953, and the representative meetings of the party organizations in various provinces (states) will be held in June of the same year.

    印共中央举行扩大全体会议
    会议认为印度人民的主要任务是争取和平
    【新华社新德里十五日电】印度共产党中央总部发表的新闻公报说：印度共产党中央委员会扩大全体会议已于一九五二年十二月三十一日到一九五三年一月十日在加尔各答举行。出席会议的有中央委员会委员以及印度各省（邦）党组织的代表共七十九人。会议讨论了过去数月来的政治局势和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的意义，并对斯大林的新著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”表示欢迎。
    会议认为：印度人民和全世界人民一样，他们的主要任务是为争取和平而斗争，并孤立帝国主义阵营内部的冒险者。
    会议决定广泛宣传维也纳世界人民和平大会的决议，认为根据这些决议把印度人民广泛地团结起来，是印度共产党的主要任务之一。
    为了印度和巴基斯坦两国人民的和平与繁荣而进行的争取印巴两国友好关系的运动，将是印度和平运动的重要部分。除了世界和平运动的总任务外，还必须进行运动，反对给予英国征募的尼泊尔廓尔喀士兵以过境便利和反对使法国利用印度基地来进行侵略越南人民的战争。这种运动将是印度和平运动的特别任务。
    会议认为，印度只有挣脱英联邦的镣铐、保卫它的自由和主权，反对美国在经济、政治和文化生活方面的渗入，才能发挥它应有的作用，进行不倦的努力来保卫和平。会议讨论了促进民族解放运动的任务；还讨论了印度日益增长的经济危机。
    印度共产党早已决定尽力和一切民主党派、组织、团体和个人组成统一战线。这次会议重申这个决定，并回顾了各省（邦）在印度大选后建立统一战线的经验。
    会议讨论了党组织中的缺点，并已作出某些决定，来进一步加强党的组织和团结。
    会议决定，下一届全印共产党代表大会将于一九五三年九月召开，各省（邦）党组织的代表会议将于同年六月召开。
