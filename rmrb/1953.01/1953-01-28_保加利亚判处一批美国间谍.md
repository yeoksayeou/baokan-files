    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 27th: The Bulgarian people have recently achieved a new victory in their struggle against American imperialist espionage. According to TASS from Sofia: The Sofia District Court of Bulgaria tried ten criminals on the 19th and 20th who were engaged in espionage activities under the instructions of American intelligence agencies in Turkey. The main criminal was T.S. Kristov. He was a henchman of the German fascists during World War II. After fleeing to Turkey in the spring of 1951, he received special agent training from American intelligence agencies. In September 1952, with the help of the Turkish authorities, he illegally sneaked into Bulgaria and established a criminal spy organization. This organization conspired to overthrow the people's regime in Bulgaria by organizing riots, sabotage, and terrorist acts, as well as inciting foreign armed intervention. It also collected political, economic, and military intelligence related to the security of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and supplied it to American intelligence agencies through Turkey. The indictment read in court during the trial pointed out that Bulgaria had held numerous trials concerning conspiracy and espionage cases, which irrefutably proved that those imperialist puppet states in the Balkans had become centers of conspiracy and espionage, recruiting adventurers, social outcasts, and criminals. These criminals received special agent training from foreign espionage agencies in Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. After receiving weapons and other materials, they sneaked into Bulgaria to carry out espionage and sabotage activities. This is the implementation of the American Truman "Mutual Security Act," which finances criminal activities to undermine the unity and independence of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.
    The defendants pleaded guilty to their crimes during the trial. The Sofia District Court pronounced its verdict on the 20th, sentencing the principal offender Kristov to death and the other defendants to varying terms of imprisonment.

    保加利亚判处一批美国间谍
    【新华社二十七日讯】保加利亚人民最近在反对美帝国主义间谍分子的斗争中又获得了新的胜利。据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚的索非亚地方法院，在十九日和二十日审讯了十名在土耳其境内的美国情报机关的指示下进行间谍活动的罪犯。主要罪犯是托·斯·克里斯托夫。他是第二次世界大战期间德国法西斯的走卒，他在一九五一年春潜逃到土耳其后，就接受美国情报机关的特务训练，并在一九五二年九月在土耳其当局的帮助下，非法潜入保加利亚，建立了罪恶的间谍组织。这个组织阴谋用组织暴动、捣乱和恐怖行动以及招引外国武装干涉等手段来推翻保加利亚的人民政权，并搜集有关保加利亚人民共和国安全的政治、经济和军事情报，通过土耳其供给美国情报机关。审讯时法庭上宣读的起诉书指出：保加利亚曾举行过多次关于阴谋间谍案的审讯，这些审讯无容置辩地证明了：巴尔干半岛上的那些帝国主义仆从国家，已经成为收罗冒险分子、社会败类和犯罪分子的阴谋和间谍中心。这些罪犯在希腊、土耳其和南斯拉夫境内接受外国间谍机关的特务训练。他们得到了武器和其他物资以后，就潜入保加利亚进行间谍和破坏活动。这就是对破坏保加利亚人民共和国的统一和独立的罪恶活动进行资助的美国杜鲁门“共同安全法”的实施。
    被告在审讯中对他们所犯的罪行都供认不讳。索非亚地方法院已在二十日宣判，对首犯克里斯托夫处以死刑，对其他被告分别处以刑期不等的徒刑。
