    Gejiu Tin Mine Equipped for Large-Scale Production After Exploration

    After more than two years of geological exploration, the Gejiu Tin Mine in Yunnan Province is now equipped to shift from blind, manual mining to planned, large-scale production. To date, the geological exploration team in the Gejiu Tin Mine area has essentially completed detailed geological surveys of two major areas, preliminarily verified ore reserves, identified new mineralization zones, and prepared a complete set of drawings for topographic surveying, surface geology, tunnel geology, and mine survey. This provides reliable technical design data necessary for regular production, including shaft sinking and tunnel construction.

    Although the Gejiu Tin Mine has a history of over a hundred years of mining, no systematic resource surveys have ever been conducted. Not even a detailed geological map existed. Mining was done blindly using manual methods, extracting tin wherever it was found, resulting in significant resource waste. To change this situation and enable the large-scale production of abundant tin ore under planned, regular conditions, the People's Government dispatched a geological exploration team to the mining area in 1950. The geological exploration team completed arduous and detailed work tasks with limited manpower and technical expertise. Based on the requirements of the task, this geological exploration team should have been equipped with at least four times the current number of geological personnel. However, over the past two years, they have adopted proactive measures to increase their capabilities to resolve this contradiction. For example, in tunnel geological surveys, initially only one person had technical experience. Mine surveying was also entirely undertaken by miners who originally did not understand surveying technology. However, under the instruction and guidance of experienced geologists, through strengthened professional study and apprenticeship methods, many "novices" quickly became competent in their work.

    The geological exploration team members not only climbed high mountains and cliffs but also worked in low, damp mine tunnels. Despite the arduous work, their morale remained high, and work efficiency continuously improved. For example, in tunnel geological surveys, the original individual operation method allowed one person to survey only 70 to 100 meters per day. After switching to assembly line operations, efficiency increased to 200 to 300 meters. As a result, they not only completed their own work tasks but were also able to allocate skilled personnel to support other mining areas. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    个旧锡矿经勘探后已具备大量生产条件
    云南省个旧锡矿经过两年多地质勘探工作以后，已经具备了从盲目手工开采走上有计划地大量生产的条件。到目前为止，个旧锡矿区的地质勘探队已基本上完成了两个主要地区的地质精查工作，初步证实了矿藏量，确定了新的矿化带，并在地形测量和地面地质、坑道地质、矿洞调查等方面，都已绘制好成套的图纸，从而给正规生产所必需的凿井和坑道建设提供了可靠的技术设计资料。
    个旧锡矿虽有一百多年的开采历史，但历来没有作过系统的资源调查，连一张地质详查图都没人作过，只是盲目地用手工开采方法见锡就采，使资源浪费很大。为改变这种局面，使丰富的锡矿能够在有计划的正规的条件下进行大量生产，一九五○年，人民政府特派出地质勘探队到矿区进行工作。地质勘探队是在人力少、技术不熟的情况下完成繁重而精细的工作任务的。根据任务要求，这个地质勘探队至少要配备比现在多四倍的地质人员才行。但是他们两年多来采取积极的增长力量的办法来解决这个矛盾。如坑道地质调查方面，原来只有一个人有技术经验，矿洞测量工作也完全由原来不懂测量技术的矿工来担任，但他们在老地质人员的讲授和指导下，用加强业务学习和带徒弟的办法，使许多“生手”都很快地胜任了自己的工作。
    地质勘探队人员不但攀登高山悬崖，而且还在低矮的阴湿的矿洞里进行工作。工作虽然艰苦，但他们的情绪始终很饱满，工作效率不断提高，例如在坑道地质调查方面，原来采取个体作业，一个人
    一天只能调查七十到一百公尺，从改行流水作业后，效率就提高到二百到三百公尺。因此，他们不仅完成了本身的工作任务，而且还能抽出熟练的工作人员支援其他矿区。　（据新华社讯）
