Title: Lack of Reasonable Vacation System for Construction Workers Leads to Serious Absenteeism

To the Editor: Currently, construction workers in many areas do not have a reasonable work-rest system, which has a very negative impact on their health and work morale.

As far as I know, construction workers in Northeast, Northwest, and other regions work from the start of construction in the spring to the winter shutdown, with no other days off except for the holidays stipulated by the Government Administration Council. In North China, the "bi-weekly rest system" (i.e., one day off every two weeks) has only gradually been implemented in Beijing and other places since last September. Due to the climate in Southwest China, construction can be carried out all year round, so workers work all year round without rest. This work system is unreasonable, and therefore difficult to implement. Workers have to resort to asking for leave or even absenteeism to get necessary rest or deal with unavoidable personal matters. For example, in a certain week in mid-November last year, the Chengdu Municipal Committee construction site had 130 bricklayers, with a total of more than 20 working days lost due to absenteeism, 26 working days lost due to personal leave; 70 carpenters, with a total of four working days lost due to absenteeism, six working days lost due to personal leave, and 23 working days lost due to sick leave due to overwork. For example, at the Southwest Nationalities College construction site, on the day after a salary distribution, absenteeism was as high as 35.7% of the total number of workers. Before the winter shutdown last year, the Central Construction Engineering Department also sent people to construction sites in some areas to investigate, and the result was: in places without a rest system, not a single worker had not taken leave or been absent in a month. Even in the Northeast region, where the supply of daily necessities and other living problems are relatively well resolved, and there is about half a year of winter leisure, the absenteeism rate during the construction period is still around 10%.

This absenteeism is very detrimental to work. Construction units cannot accurately grasp the number of people attending work, and therefore cannot accurately grasp the progress of the project. Especially in places where advanced work methods have been implemented, the absence of one worker often disrupts the original division of labor and even paralyzes some work. In many construction sites in Chengdu, bricklaying teams often experience brick-waiting and mud-waiting phenomena because a miscellaneous worker is absent.

Experience has proven that as long as a reasonable rest system is established, this absenteeism will gradually decrease. In late November last year, 29 construction sites in Chengdu implemented a Sunday rest system on a trial basis, and as a result, the absenteeism rate generally decreased. For example, after the Southwest Nationalities College construction site implemented the Sunday rest system, the absenteeism rate dropped to about 7%, and there were no more cases of absenteeism without reason. After the "bi-weekly rest system" was implemented on a trial basis in Beijing and other places in North China, attendance also increased.

This year, the motherland is beginning to carry out large-scale capital construction, and the tasks of construction workers are heavy and the work is intense. If their rest system problem cannot be resolved in a timely manner, it will not only affect the health of the workers, but also be detrimental to the smooth completion of the country's construction tasks. Therefore, I believe that the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Construction Workers' Work Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should pay attention to this issue and jointly study solutions.

### 建筑工人没有合理休假制度  造成了严重的自流缺勤情况

    建筑工人没有合理休假制度
    造成了严重的自流缺勤情况
    编辑同志：目前许多地区的建筑工人还没有合理的工休制度，这对工人们的健康和工作情绪都有很不好的影响。
    据我所知，东北、西北等地的建筑工人从春季开工到冬季歇工，其间除了政务院规定的几个假日外，再无其他休息日。华北地区也只是从去年九月才在北京等地逐步试行“大礼拜休息制”（即每两个星期休息一天）。而西南地区因为气候关系，一年四季都可施工，工人们也就一年干到头，没有休息。这种工作制度是不合理的，因此也就很难贯彻。工人们为了必要的休息或某些非办不可的私事，只得以请假甚至旷工来解决。如中共成都市委员会工地在去年十一月中旬某一个星期以内，泥工一百三十人，共旷工二十多个劳动日，事假缺勤二十六个劳动日；木工七十人，共旷工四个劳动日，事假缺勤六个劳动日，因工作过累请病假的二十三个劳动日。又如西南民族学院工地，某次发工资后一天，旷工人数高达总人数的百分之三十五点七。去年冬季歇工前，中央建筑工程部也曾派人到某些地方的工地去调查，结果是：在没有休息制度的地方，根本没有一个工人在一个月中没有请过假或是旷过工。就是日用品的供应和其他生活问题都解决得比较好、而且冬闲半年左右的东北地区，开工期的缺勤率还在百分之十左右。
    这种缺勤现象对工作是很不利的。各施工单位不能很好掌握出勤人数，也就无法很好地掌握工程的进度。特别是在已经推行了先进工作法的地方，一个工人缺勤，往往会打乱原来的分工，甚至使部分工作陷于瘫痪。成都市许多工地的泥工小组，常因一个打杂的工人缺勤，而使砌砖工人发生等砖、等泥的现象。
    经验证明，只要建立合理的休息制度，这种缺勤的情况是会逐渐减少的。去年十一月下旬，成都市有二十九个工地试行了星期日休息制度，结果缺勤率普遍降低。如民族学院工地试行星期休假制后，缺勤率就降到百分之七左右，而且无故旷工的情况已经没有了。华北地区北京等地试行“大礼拜休息制”后，出勤情况也增高了。
    今年祖国开始进行大规模的基本建设工作，建筑工人的任务是重大的，工作是紧张的。如果他们的休息制度问题不能及时解决，不仅会影响工人的健康，而且对国家建设任务的顺利完成也是不利的。因此，我认为中央人民政府劳动部、建筑工程部和中华全国总工会建筑工会工作委员会都应该重视这个问题，并协同研究解决办法。
