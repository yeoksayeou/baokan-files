    New Year's Eve on the Shangganling Heights
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Qing Zhao, Correspondent Cao Peng
    On New Year's Eve, the heroic Shangganling Heights resounded with joyous voices of "Celebrating Victory, Welcoming the New Year!"

    Only a month ago, fierce battles were raging here. Today, the white snow has covered the enemy's corpses and the scorched earth plowed by artillery fire. Our soldiers wrote in large characters on the snow: "We have won, and Van Fleet has run into a wall!" Many tunnel entrances were decorated with colorful arches, new couplets, and horizontal scrolls. The top of the arches were adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao and large red stars. The inside of the tunnels were brightly lit by "Victory Lamps" and "Glory Lamps," and the walls were plastered with colorful New Year slogans such as "Don't be arrogant or complacent, march from victory to victory!" and "Don't be afraid of sweating or bleeding, defend the country's economic construction next year!"

    The New Year brought unparalleled joy to the heroic victors - the vast number of commanders and fighters of our army. Our transport units had already delivered abundant New Year's food to the forward tunnels, and New Year's greetings from the leaders and New Year's cards with peace dove patterns flew to the front lines like snowflakes. Many company, platoon, and squad wall newspapers published "New Year Special Editions," featuring the glorious deeds of countless heroes in the Shangganling Campaign and the commanders' and fighters' determination to greet the New Year in battle. Each company also formed "Victory Drama Troupes" or "New Year Singing Teams," and cultural troupe members went deep into the companies to help the soldiers create a variety of lively New Year entertainment programs. The soldiers of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army had already created programs such as "Tang Zhiping Sacrifices Himself to Blast Enemy Groups," "The Resourceful and Courageous Commander Liu Haichen," "The Lone Hero Zhang Zhirong," and "Singing of the Great Victory of the Shangganling Campaign," preparing to perform them during the New Year.

    As the New Year approached, how the heroes in joy missed their beloved motherland! They sat around the lamp, talking about the great achievements of the motherland's construction and work in the past three years and the large-scale economic construction that was about to begin. Many soldiers took out letters from home from their pockets and said excitedly, "Let's open the letters from home and see the motherland!" Thus, thousands of family letters were eagerly passed around. In one letter, soldier Huo Lianhong's father reported to his son that he had been elected as a model worker for high yield; in another letter, machine gunner Gong Qinghai's wife reported to her husband that she had been elected as a labor model and had become an honorable member of the Communist Youth League; Wang Keze's brother worked in a steel plant in Chongqing, and he wrote to report on the factory's production news and to tell them that their hometown, the Tenth Village of the Seventh District of Nanchong County, had been electrified; squad leader Zou Keming's wife wrote that she had achieved a great cultural turnaround and had taken the train on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to a city 120 li away from home to attend a crash middle school course; Sniper Xie Zhenfang's father sent a photo from the banks of the Huai River, his smiling, plump face making his son hardly believe that this was his fifty-year-old father who had worked almost all his life for the landlords. Happiness and gratitude made Xie Zhenfang's eyes glisten with tears. A family letter is a good news report! Every family letter brings the soldiers infinite happiness and strength! After the People's Daily editorial "Congratulations on the Great Victory of Our Army on the Shangganling Front" was transmitted, it gave the troops even greater encouragement. They felt that this was the voice of the people of the motherland, the fighting call of the people of the motherland. On a forward position on Red Hill (Height 597.9), the commander led the soldiers in a solemn oath: Standing on Red Hill, we pledge to the people of the motherland that we will never give up until we achieve the final victory!

    To defend the motherland's beautiful construction, to answer the deep concern of the people of the motherland, after the Shangganling Campaign, the heroic soldiers have been actively striking the enemy every day. Whenever the morning light reflects the mountain peaks, the early morning sniper competition begins on the forward positions. Twenty-one-year-old young sniper Jiang Shigui has already killed four enemies. On December 20, he wrapped a white towel around his head and draped a white cloth over his body, lying prone on the snow only eighty meters from the enemy's position. He raised his automatic rifle and aimed at an enemy who was walking. As soon as the enemy stopped, Jiang Shigui fired. The enemy cried out and fell down. Later, Xiao Jiang moved to another place and killed two more enemies. After he walked back to the tunnel, he excitedly took out the letter he had already written from his pocket, changed the original "four" to "seven" with a pen, and added a sentence at the end of the letter: "Mom, I eliminated three more enemies for you this year." On another forward position, Jiang Guangjun, the deputy squad leader of the "Combat Model Squad," saw three South Korean soldiers digging fortifications on the opposite mountain, and said to the young soldier Wen Zeyu next to him: "Aim and fire! Xiao Wen, don't let the enemy raise their heads!" Xiao Wen fired a shot, and an enemy fell in response. The other two enemies crawled hard on the snow and did not move. Jiang Guangjun knew that the enemy must be trying to run away suddenly, so he and Xiao Wen divided the task of aiming at the places where the two enemies were lying down. When the enemies suddenly jumped up from the ground, two shots rang out simultaneously, killing the two enemies who had not yet gained a foothold. The snipers were fulfilling their bold words: "Don't let the enemy raise their heads!" The snipers on Red Hill alone eliminated 390 enemies in the past 28 days. The snipers happily sang a self-composed clapper: "Shooting at live targets with automatic rifles, eight bullets fully loaded in the magazine, be calm and mobile, shoot when the enemy raises their head. Don't let them dig fortifications, don't let them even relieve themselves, make them bow their heads before us!"

    While preparing to celebrate the New Year, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Shangganling front are writing enthusiastic New Year's greetings to the people of the motherland. Some of these letters are addressed to famous labor models of the motherland such as Ma Hengchang, Su Changyou, and Li Shunda, and some are addressed to their fathers, mothers, or wives. In the letters, the soldiers thank the people of the motherland for their strong support over the past year, and challenge the labor models and their relatives in the letters. The soldiers guarantee to create greater victories in the cause of defending the motherland and defending peace!

    The commanders and fighters on the Shangganling front are also writing letters to the great leader Chairman Mao to express their New Year greetings with infinite love and gratitude, and to express their determination to fight. All the commanders and fighters of the Third Company of a certain unit, which was awarded the title of "First-Class Merit Company" for continuously capturing three positions in one night and annihilating more than 800 enemies in the Shangganling Campaign, said in a letter to Chairman Mao:

    "The motherland will begin large-scale economic construction next year. In order to build our motherland even better, we must maintain our honor, promote our honor, and summarize the successful experiences of the past year, especially the Shangganling battle, so that we can build our positions more solidly and ingeniously, making them impregnable iron positions forever. We firmly believe that with you - the beloved Chairman Mao, we will always be victorious!"

    The great 1953 is about to come, and it will bring new and greater victories to the heroes who are fighting for justice and peace.

    新年前夕在上甘岭阵地上
    新华社记者  庆肇  通讯员  曹鹏
    新年前夕，英雄的上甘岭阵地上滚腾着一片“庆祝胜利，迎接新年”的欢乐声音。
    一个月以前，这里还进行着激烈的战斗。今天，白雪已经把敌人的尸体和被炮火犁松的焦土都掩盖起来了，我军战士们在雪地上写了一行大字：“我们胜利了，范佛里特碰壁了！”许多坑道工事的门口都搭起了彩门，贴上新的对联和横额，彩门上端悬挂着毛主席像和大红星。坑道的里面已被一盏盏“胜利灯”、“光荣灯”照得通明，四壁张贴着“不骄不懈，从胜利走向胜利！”、“不怕流汗流血，保卫祖国明年的经济大建设！”等五彩的新年标语。
    新年给英雄的胜利者——我军广大的指挥员、战斗员们带来了无比的欢乐。我军运输部队已把丰富的新年食物送进了前沿的坑道，部队首长的贺年信和印有和平鸽图案的贺年片也雪片似地飞到前线。许多连队、排、班的墙报都出版了“新年专刊”，上面登载了上甘岭战役中无数英雄们的辉煌业绩和指挥员、战斗员们迎接新年的战斗决心。各个连队还都组成了“胜利剧团”或“新年演唱队”，文工团员们深入到连队帮助战士们编排各种生动活泼的新年娱乐节目。志愿军某部五连的战士们已编出“唐治平舍身炸敌群”、“智勇双全的指挥员刘海臣”、“孤胆英雄张志荣”和“歌唱上甘岭战役大胜利”等节目，准备在新年时演出。
    新年临近了，欢乐中的英雄们是多么怀念可爱的祖国啊！他们围坐在灯光下，谈着祖国三年来各项建设和工作上的伟大成就和即将开始的大规模的经济建设。许多战士从口袋里拿出家信来，激动地说：“让我们打开家信看祖国吧！”于是，万千家书被争相传阅着。在这封信里，战士霍联鸿的父亲向儿子报告他当选为丰产劳动模范；在那封信里，机枪射手龚清海的妻子向丈夫报告她当选为劳动模范并成为光荣的青年团员；王克泽的哥哥在重庆某炼钢厂工作，他来信除报告厂里的生产消息外，还告诉他们的家乡南充县七区十村已经用上了电灯；班长邹克明的妻子来信说，她已经在文化上获得大翻身，坐成渝铁路的火车到离家一百二十里路的城市去上速成中学了；狙击手谢振芳的父亲从淮河岸上寄来了照片，满含笑容的胖胖的脸庞，使他儿子一时不敢相信这就是几乎给地主扛了一辈子活的五十多岁的老父亲，高兴和感激使谢振芳的眼睛里闪着泪花。一封家信就是一份喜报啊！每一封家信都给战士们带来无限的幸福和力量！人民日报“祝贺上甘岭前线我军的伟大胜利”的社论传来以后，更给部队带来极大的鼓舞，他们觉得这就是祖国人民的声音，祖国人民的战斗号召。在红山顶（五九七点九高地）的一个前哨阵地上，指挥员带着战士们在庄严宣誓：我们站在红山顶上，向祖国人民保证，不取得最后胜利决不罢休！
    为了保卫祖国美好的建设事业，回答祖国人民深切的关怀，上甘岭战役结束后，英勇的战士们每天都在积极地打击敌人。每当晨曦映射着山岗的时候，前沿阵地上就开始了早晨的狙击竞赛。二十一岁的青年狙击手蒋世贵已经打死了四个敌人。十二月二十日，他又头上包着白毛巾，身上披着白布伏在一个离敌人阵地只有八十公尺的雪地上，他端起自动步枪瞄准了一个正在走动着的敌人。敌人刚一停脚，蒋世贵就开了枪。那个敌人哎呀一声倒了下去。以后，小蒋移到另一个地方，又打死了两个敌人。当他走回坑道之后，就兴奋地从衣袋里掏出已经写好的家信，用钢笔把原来的“四”字改为“七”字，并在信尾上注上一句：“妈妈，今年我又给你消灭了三个敌人。”在另一处前哨阵地上，“战斗模范班”副班长蒋光俊看到三个李伪军士兵在对面山上挖工事，便对身旁的青年战士温则裕说：“瞄准打呀！小温，不让敌人抬起头来！”小温打了一枪，一个敌人应声而倒，另外两个敌人用劲爬倒在雪地上不动。蒋光俊知道敌人一定想出我不意突然跑掉，他便和小温分工瞄准两个敌人卧倒的地方，等到敌人忽地一下从地下爬起来，就“砰”
    “砰”两枪齐放，把两个还没有站稳脚的敌人打死了。狙击手们实现着自己的豪语：“不让敌人抬起头来！”仅红山顶上的狙击手们在最近的二十八天中就消灭了三百九十名敌人。狙击手们愉快地唱着自编的快板：打活靶，用自动枪，八发子弹压满膛，要沉着要机动，敌人抬头就开枪。工事不让他挖，屎尿也不让他拉，叫他在老子面前只有把头低下！
    上甘岭前线的志愿军指挥员战斗员们在准备欢度新年的同时，正纷纷给祖国人民写着热情的贺年信。这些信，有些是给祖国的著名劳动模范马恒昌、苏长有、李顺达等，有些是给自己的父亲、母亲或妻子的。信中，战士们感谢祖国人民一年来给他们的大力支援，并在信上向劳动模范和自己的亲人挑战。战士们保证在保卫祖国、保卫和平的事业中创造更伟大的胜利！
    上甘岭前线的指挥员战斗员们更怀着无限敬爱和感激的心情纷纷写信给伟大的领袖毛主席贺年，并表示战斗决心。在上甘岭战役中，一夜连续攻占三处阵地，歼敌八百多人而荣获“一等功臣连”称号的某部第三连全体指战员在写给毛主席的信上说：
    “祖国明年就要开始大规模的经济建设了，为了我们祖国建设得更美好，我们一定要保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，很好地总结一年来，特别是上甘岭战斗的成功经验，把我们的阵地建造得更坚固更巧妙，成为永远攻不破的钢铁阵地。我们坚定地相信，有了您——敬爱的毛主席，我们就永远胜利！”
    伟大的一九五三年就要来临了，它将给为正义和和平事业而战的英雄们带来新的更大的胜利。
