Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th: The Northwest region has basically prepared the basic construction materials for the first quarter. Various material marketing agencies are now organizing transportation for the construction units.

The materials needed by the various basic construction units are primarily being resolved from existing reserves and stagnant materials in the Northwest. Steel and machinery resolved from stagnant materials in the first quarter of this year accounted for 20% of the first quarter's needs. Steel resolved from reserve materials accounted for over 24%, and timber accounted for over 20%.

In order to ensure timely material supply for construction and reduce intermediate handling, materials transferred from outside the region in the first quarter are directly transported from the place of production to the various construction sites. Among them, over 50% of cement was transported from the place of production to the construction units in October of last year.

Various materials supply units are continuing to adopt various methods to carry out preparatory work. The Northwest Building Materials Company has merged its thirteen scattered hardware, brick, tile, and timber factories into five relatively large factories and has made reasonable adjustments to the original equipment, so that the potential of the equipment is fully utilized. The Northwest Regional Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company has been divided into three companies: Hardware Machinery, Chemical Dyes, and Transportation and Electrical Appliances. They are now rushing to prepare this year's supply plan, organize sources of materials, and conduct inventory and item categorization, preparing to sign formal supply contracts with various basic construction units. The Industry Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government pre-allocated one-third of the total first-quarter demand for lime to various construction units in December of last year, and organized more than 400 public and private lime kilns to produce lime for basic construction units, establishing two lime supply stations in Tongchuan and Yaoxian, Shaanxi.

    西北第一季度基本建设材料准备好了
    【新华社西安十九日电】西北区第一季度基本建设材料已基本上准备好。现在正由各材料推销机关组织各施工单位运输。
    各基本建设单位所需材料，都尽先从西北现有的储备材料和呆滞材料中解决。今年第一季度从呆滞材料中解决的钢材、机器占第一季度需要量的百分之二十。从储备材料中解决的钢材占百分之二十四以上，木材占百分之二十以上。
    为了保证不误施工用料和减少中间周转次数，第一季度由外区调运的材料，都直接由产地运到各工地。其中水泥在去年十月份就有百分之五十以上由产地运到了施工单位。
    各材料供应单位都在继续采取各种办法进行准备工作。西北建筑器材公司已把所属十三个分散经营的五金、砖瓦、木材等工厂合并成五个比较大的工厂，并对原有设备进行了合理调整，使设备潜力得到充分发挥。中国工业器材公司西北区公司已由一个公司分组成五金机械、化工染料、交通电器三个公司，现正赶制今年的供应计划，组织物资来源，进行清理仓库和物品排队，准备和各基本建设单位签订正式供应合同。陕西省人民政府工业厅在去年十二月份就预拨各施工单位占第一季度总需要量三分之一的石灰，并已组织了四百多个公营和私营石灰窑为基本建设单位生产石灰，在陕西铜川、耀县建立了两处石灰供应站。
