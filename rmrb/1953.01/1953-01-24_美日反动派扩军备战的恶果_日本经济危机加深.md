　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The policy of arms expansion and war preparations pursued by the US and Japanese reactionaries has resulted in a deepening economic crisis in Japan.

　　At the beginning of the Korean War, stimulated by US military orders and the capitalist world's rush to purchase materials, Japan's industrial production and exports once presented a false prosperity. However, with the failure of the US war of aggression against Korea and the intensification of the battle for markets among capitalist countries, this so-called "prosperity" has burst like a soap bubble. The shadow of economic panic loomed heavily over Japan in 1952. The decline in foreign trade was particularly significant and had a huge impact. According to statistics from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the total approved export value in 1952 was more than 1.254 billion US dollars, a decrease of more than 11 percent compared with 1.408 billion US dollars in 1951. In particular, textile products, which account for a large proportion of Japan's exports, have seen a sharp decline in exports, decreasing by 28.5 percent - 184 million US dollars - in terms of cargo value compared with 1951.

　　Under the impact of the decline in foreign trade, the Japanese economy quickly showed signs of overproduction panic. Many industrial sectors have suspended work and reduced production. In March 1952, the textile industry reduced production by 40 percent, the rubber industry reduced production by 30 percent, and the phosphate fertilizer industry reduced production by 10 percent. This downturn continued to develop. Taking the textile industry as an example, after the storm in March, production slightly recovered, but the phenomenon of sluggish sales and increasing inventory reappeared. In November, the price of cotton yarn finally plummeted to an unprecedented level. Under the impact of repeated blows, the Japanese textile industry has been forced to decide to reduce monthly cotton yarn production from 165,000 bales to 150,000 bales starting in January 1953.

　　The fundamental reason for the Japanese economic crisis is the continued US military occupation of Japan, which has forced Japan's economy onto a war footing. On the one hand, it uses military orders to support Japanese monopoly capital, and on the other hand, it uses blockades and embargoes to strangle Japan's civilian industries. For example, taking the average Japanese industrial production index from 1934-1936 before the war as 100, the Japanese industrial production index in March 1952 had reached 134, but the development was mainly in the metal industry and the machinery industry related to military production – compared with before the war, the former was 184 and the latter was nearly 178. Non-military sectors are far below pre-war levels - the textile and dye industries are below 70, the oil and fat industry is about 60, and the leather industry is about 82.

　　Under this policy, small and medium-sized Japanese national capital enterprises have suffered serious blows. According to the Japanese government's reduced figures, from January to August 1952, more than 9,100 companies went bankrupt, resulting in an additional 170,000 unemployed people.

　　The lives of the broad masses of Japanese working people are becoming increasingly difficult. At least eight million people go to "employment agencies" every month to seek employment, but all they get is disappointment. Employed workers are in a difficult situation because of increased labor intensity and low wages.

　　As the US and Japanese reactionaries intensify their arms expansion and war preparations, the Japanese economic crisis will further deepen. Kyodo News Agency is already gloomily saying: Japan's "business community is increasingly worried about the difficulty of Japan's economic future in 1953."

### 美日反动派扩军备战的恶果  日本经济危机加深

    美日反动派扩军备战的恶果
    日本经济危机加深
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：美、日反动派推行扩军备战政策的结果，使日本经济危机日渐加深。
    在侵朝战争爆发之初，在美国的军事订货和资本主义世界抢购物资的刺激之下，日本的工业生产和输出一度呈现出虚假的繁荣。但是，随着美国侵朝战争的失败和资本主义国家之间市场争夺战的剧烈化，所谓“繁荣”已像肥皂泡一样地破灭了。经济恐慌的阴影在一九五二年浓重地笼罩了日本。情况特别显著、影响巨大的是对外贸易的衰退。据通商产业省的统计，一九五二年的批准出口总额是十二亿五千四百多万美元，比一九五一年的十四亿零八百多万美元减少了百分之十一以上。特别是占日本输出品的大宗的纺织品，出口锐减，按货价计算比一九五一年减少了百分之二十八点五——一亿八千四百万美元。
    在对外贸易衰退的打击下，日本经济迅速呈现出生产过剩的恐慌。许多工业部门纷纷停工减产，在一九五二年三月间，纺织业减产百分之四十，橡胶业减产百分之三十，磷酸肥料业减产百分之十。这种不景气的趋势不断发展，以纺织业为例，经过三月间的风暴之后，生产稍微恢复就又出现销路呆滞存货日增的现象，在十一月间终于爆发为棉纱价格空前暴跌。在接二连三的打击之下，日本纺织业已经被迫决定从一九五三年一月起再度将每月的棉纱产量从十六万五千包减少到十五万包。
    造成日本经济危机的根本原因，是美国对日本继续军事占领，强制把日本的经济推上战争轨道。它一方面用军事订货来扶植日本垄断资本，另一方面则用封锁禁运等等手段来扼杀日本的民用工业。如以战前一九三四年—一九三六年的日本平均工业生产指数为一○○，一九五二年三月日本的工业生产指数虽然已经达到一三四，但是真正得到发展的主要是和军需生产有关的金属工业和机械工业，——和战前相比，前者是一八四，后者将近一七八。非军需部门却远远低于战前水平——纺织业和染料业都在七○以下，油脂业约为六○，皮革业约为八二。
    在这种政策下面，日本民族资本的中小企业已遭受了严重的打击。根据日本官方缩小了的数字，在一九五二年一月到八月，倒闭的企业有九千一百多家，因此又增加了十七万失业人口。
    日本广大劳动人民生活日益困苦。每月至少有八百万人到“职业介绍所”去求职，而他们所得到的只是失望。在业的工人因为劳动强度增加、工资低微，正处在难以生活苦境之中。
    随着美、日反动派加紧扩军备战的活动，日本经济危机将要进一步加深。共同社已经在阴郁地说：日本“实业界对于一九五三年日本经济前途的艰巨，加深了忧虑。”
