Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 13th: The Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region and the Longlin Various Nationalities Joint Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province were formally established on December 3rd of last year and New Year's Day of this year, respectively. Both autonomous regions are local administrative authorities at the county level within the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region is inhabited by five ethnic groups, including Dong, Zhuang, Han, Yao, and Miao, totaling 202,303 people, with the Dong population accounting for 46%. The Longlin Various Nationalities Joint Autonomous Region includes parts of Xilong County and Xilin County, with seven ethnic groups including Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Gelao, Yi, Lailai, and Han, totaling 184,000 people, with the Zhuang and Miao populations being the largest. In the past, under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of all ethnic groups in this area lived in extreme poverty, and there were many bandits, which was once known as the "appendix of Guangxi." Since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in the area have eliminated banditry, built a highway from Tianlin to Longlin in the mountains, and actively carried out trade and health work. The People's Government has also distributed a large number of relief grains and production loans to help the people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang and Longlin restore production and improve their living conditions.

	The Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region and the Longlin Various Nationalities Joint Autonomous Region began ethnic regional autonomy work in April and July of last year, cultivating and selecting ethnic minority cadres, and establishing ethnic democratic political power at the district and township levels. Recently, they successively convened the first session of the People's Representatives Conference of all ethnic groups in the autonomous regions, announcing the formal establishment of the autonomous regions. After full consultation, the people's representatives of all ethnic groups elected the county magistrate and deputy county magistrate and members of the county people's government at the meeting, and adopted the administrative plan of the autonomous region.

    广西省三江侗族自治区成立
    隆林各民族成立联合自治区
   【新华社南宁十三日电】广西省三江侗族自治区和隆林各民族联合自治区，已在去年十二月三日和今年元旦正式成立。这两个自治区都是桂西僮族自治区内相当于县一级的地方政权。三江侗族自治区内有侗、僮、汉、瑶、苗等五个民族，共二十万二千三百零三人，其中侗族人口占百分之四十六。隆林各民族联合自治区包括西隆县和西林县的一部分地区，境内有僮、苗、瑶、仡佬、彝、徕徕、汉等七个民族，共十八万四千人，以僮族、苗族的人口最多。这一地区过去在国民党反动派长期统治下，各族人民生活非常贫困，盗匪很多，曾被称为“广西的盲肠”。解放以后，该区各族人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，肃清了匪患，在丛山峻岭中修通了由田林到隆林的公路，并积极开展了贸易、卫生工作。人民政府还发放了大批救济粮款和生产贷款，帮助三江和隆林的各族人民恢复生产，改善了生活状况。
    三江侗族自治区和隆林各民族联合自治区在去年四月、七月开始进行民族区域自治工作，培养和选拔民族干部，建立了区、乡的民族民主政权，最近并先后召开了自治区首届各族各界人民代表会议，宣布自治区正式成立。各民族人民代表经过充分的协商，在会议上选出自治区人民政府县长和副县长及县人民政府委员，通过了自治区的施政计划。
