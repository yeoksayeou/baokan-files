1953 has arrived. 1953 presents three great tasks to the people of the whole country: First, to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and strive for greater victories; Second, to begin implementing the first Five-Year Plan for national construction, and to complete and overfulfill the 1953 construction plan; Third, to convene the National People's Congress to adopt the Constitution and the national construction plan.

The struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which our people have been engaged in for more than two years, has achieved great victories. In the past year alone, the Chinese and Korean People's forces annihilated more than 241,900 American aggressors and their accomplice troops (including more than 102,700 American troops), and shot down and damaged more than 5,300 enemy aircraft. Including the previous figures, a total of more than 736,000 enemy troops have been annihilated (including more than 322,000 American troops), and more than 7,800 enemy aircraft have been shot down and damaged. The fact that the Chinese and Korean People's forces are becoming stronger and stronger, and that the enemy's losses and consumption in terms of personnel and materials are increasing, their morale is getting lower and lower, and their internal contradictions are getting deeper and deeper, has been recognized by the world. Despite this, although the Chinese and Korean sides have repeatedly proposed reasonable solutions for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in the Panmunjom negotiations, and the Soviet representative has done so in the United Nations General Assembly, the American aggressors still refuse to make peace. The American aggressors and their collaborators insist on forcibly detaining Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, insist on continuing the war, and are actively plotting to expand their aggression. This situation cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of our people. Therefore, in 1953, our people must continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, prepare to smash the enemy's offensives and attacks in any place and in any way, and strive for new and greater victories, while continuing to strive for a just and reasonable peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Within our country, we must greatly strengthen our national defense forces, strengthen public security work and militia work, and resolutely and quickly eliminate the special agents and bandits sent by the enemy, in order to consolidate the rear for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and ensure the smooth progress of the national construction cause.

1953 will be the first year of our country's entry into large-scale construction. Is large-scale construction possible under the condition of continuing to strengthen the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid Korea? The answer is yes. In the past two years, our people have devoted great efforts to the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but this has not hindered but accelerated the completion of our economic recovery and the fundamental improvement of our financial and economic situation. In 1952, the total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 65 percent compared with 1949, and the main industrial products (except for coal, which was slightly less) and agricultural products exceeded the highest pre-war annual output level. According to preliminary statistics, taking the highest pre-liberation annual output as 100, pig iron was 105, steel ingots were 170, coal was 95, electricity was 114, cement was 153, cotton yarn was 150, cotton cloth was 165, paper was 212, grain was 109, and cotton was 155. Our country's fiscal revenue and expenditure have been completely balanced. The socialist nature of the national economy has definitely gained a leading position in industry and commerce. All of these have prepared good conditions for the country's large-scale construction.

National construction includes economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction, with economic construction as the foundation. The general task of economic construction is to gradually transform China from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country, and to achieve this goal, we must first focus on developing heavy industries such as metallurgy, fuel, electricity, machinery manufacturing, and chemicals, because as Comrade Stalin said in "The Summary of the First Five-Year Plan," "Only heavy industry can transform and promote the entire industry, transform and promote the transportation industry, and transform and promote agriculture." Industrialization—this is the ideal that our people have dreamed of for a hundred years, this is the basic guarantee that our people will no longer be bullied by imperialism and no longer live in poverty, and therefore this is the highest interest of the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country must unite with one heart and one mind and actively struggle for this highest interest.

The speed of our country's industrialization needs to greatly exceed the speed experienced by any capitalist country, and adopt the high speed that the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries have adopted in the process of industrialization and industrial development. This speed is possible because our country is a people's democratic country, our national construction and the interests of all our people are completely consistent, and its purpose is to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of our people and to consolidate national defense and safeguard peace. Therefore, our people can fully exert their labor enthusiasm and creativity in implementing the construction plan. This speed is also possible because we have the generous and selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the guidance of the Soviet Union's advanced experience, as well as the support of the People's Democratic countries and the peace-loving people of the world.

In order to realize the great national construction plan, the active efforts of the working class in our country are needed first. Workers, engineering and technical personnel, and management personnel in industry, construction, and transportation in all public and private enterprises in our country should widely launch patriotic production competitions, learn advanced working methods and advanced science and technology, further tap potential, fully utilize all possible conditions, strengthen the technical management of enterprises, improve the operation of enterprises, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs, and strive to complete, complete ahead of schedule, and over fulfill production plans, basic construction plans, and transportation plans.

In the process of our country's industrialization, our country's agriculture also needs to develop rapidly. Peasants throughout the country should further organize themselves according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, develop and improve the agricultural labor mutual aid and production cooperation movement step by step, learn new agricultural technologies, build water conservancy projects, conserve water and soil, prevent floods, droughts, pests and diseases, and strive to increase per unit area yield, and complete and over fulfill production increase plans.

State-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private commerce should all strive to do a good job in the exchange of goods and materials, and serve the construction plans of industry and agriculture and the needs of the people's lives. State-owned commerce and cooperatives should improve their operating methods, conscientiously implement the economic accounting system, shorten the turnover time of funds, and reduce commercial circulation costs.

The national cultural and educational undertakings must actively adapt to the needs of economic construction and national defense construction. It is necessary to train a large number of construction talents of various levels, and educate young people, students, and intellectuals to intensify their studies of technology and science. It is necessary to continue to raise the political awareness of young people and all the people. It is necessary to help women break feudal shackles and achieve equal status, so as to strengthen the ranks of industrial and agricultural production.

All aspects of national construction require funds, and our funds are limited. Therefore, the people of the whole country and all the staff of the whole country must pay attention to the source of funds and the correct use of funds. In order to guarantee the investment in national construction, it is necessary to use funds with emphasis, and use the funds mainly in the undertakings that are most decisive for the fate of the country, namely, the construction of heavy industry and national defense construction, and oppose the view that everything should be done at once, and that all "good things" should be completed in a short period of time. In order to guarantee the investment in national construction, it is necessary to continue to practice thrift and careful calculation, and use every penny that can be saved for construction, and wage a resolute and merciless struggle against extravagance and waste, failure to calculate costs, and the supply system mentality.

The issue of leading cadres occupies the most important position in the issue of national construction. Comrade Stalin once said: "Any task, especially a huge task like the industrialization of our country, cannot be carried out without vigorous people, without new people, without new construction cadres. ...What we need now are new industrial command cadres, excellent factory managers, excellent trust managers, capable businessmen, and intelligent industrial construction designers. ...The task is to train these cadres, bring them to the forefront, and give them assistance in all aspects." (On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policies of the Party) Comrade Stalin also said: "What is leading production? ...What makes us ashamed is that even among our Bolsheviks, there are many people who rely solely on signing documents to lead. ...We must transform ourselves into specialists, become experts in work, and we ourselves must turn our efforts to learn technical knowledge—this is what practical life is pushing us to do." (On the Tasks of Economic Workers) "In order to realize the new type of leadership, what should we do? ...We want our economic work leaders not to lead enterprises 'in general,' not to lead enterprises 'from the air,' but to lead enterprises concretely and practically; we want them not to treat every problem based on general empty talk, but with a rigorous and realistic attitude; we want them not to be limited to perfunctory handling on paper or general rhetoric and slogans, but to be proficient in work techniques, familiar with work details, and familiar with 'small things,' because now big things are made up of 'small things.'" (New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction) Our current task is also like this. In order to realize the national construction plan, it is necessary to train and promote a large number of excellent construction cadres, and at the same time, it is required that the leaders of all construction undertakings not rely on signing documents to carry out "general" leadership, but lead enterprises concretely and practically, and become specialists and experts in work. Only in this way can the correct conduct of our national construction cause be guaranteed.

Now that our country has victoriously ended the period of economic recovery and entered the period of large-scale construction, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, the National People's Congress and the local People's Congresses at all levels should be convened to elect the Central and local People's Governments. At the National People's Congress, the Constitution and the national construction plan will be adopted. There is no doubt that this will become a major event in the political life of our people.

In the past three years or so, due to the implementation of huge social and political reforms and economic recovery work, the conditions for implementing the People's Congress system were not yet available. Our country adopted the method of the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, and the local People's Representative Conferences at all levels gradually exercising the functions and powers of the local People's Congresses at all levels. At the same time, since a Constitution has not yet been formulated, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference temporarily replaced a part of the role of the Constitution. These transitional methods, which were completely necessary in the past and completed historical tasks, are no longer suitable for the needs of the current construction period. After land reform and other social reforms, the vast majority of the people of the whole country have the conditions to elect their own government. From now on, the broadest publicity should be carried out among the people, telling the people to earnestly prepare for this election, so as to elect the people who are truly satisfied and considered necessary as representatives and members of the People's Government, and not to allow any bad elements to mix into the people's political organs. The full exercise of the people's democratic rights will more closely link the People's Government and the masses of the people, and will greatly enhance the revolutionary enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the masses of the people, and this is one of the most important conditions for the smooth realization of our country's construction plan.

The tasks of 1953 are huge. Completing the tasks of 1953 will provide a good start and foundation for the entire Five-Year Plan, which is of decisive significance for the work of the next four years. There is no doubt that all open and hidden enemies will use various methods to sabotage our cause, and we will encounter various difficulties, but we must overcome these obstacles and achieve victory. We remember that in the short period of more than three years in the past, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the strong support of the Soviet Union, the people of our country have solved problems that could not be solved in the past thousands of years, and suddenly led our motherland from a miserable dark hell to a human world full of sunshine and hope. We have victoriously completed the unification of the country, completed the land reform, carried out the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, eliminated the remnants of imperialism in China, consolidated the unity of all nationalities in the country, adjusted industry and commerce, stabilized prices, balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure, and carried out the struggle against corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and material cutting, and theft of national economic intelligence, launched the production increase and economy campaign, and completed the work of economic recovery. From this, it can be seen that the just cause of the 475 million people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the assistance of Comrade Stalin is invincible. People of all classes and nationalities throughout the country should unite as one and strive for new and greater victories.

### 迎接一九五三年的伟大任务

    迎接一九五三年的伟大任务
    一九五三年来到了。一九五三年向全国人民提出了三项伟大的任务：第一，继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，争取更大的胜利；第二，开始执行国家建设的第一个五年计划，完成和超额完成一九五三年度建设计划；第三，召集全国人民代表大会，通过宪法，通过国家建设计划。
    我国人民在两年多以来所进行的抗美援朝的斗争，已经取得了伟大的胜利。只在过去一年内，中朝人民部队就歼灭美国侵略者及其帮凶军二十四万一千九百余人（内美军十万二千七百余人），击落击伤敌军飞机五千三百余架。连以前合计，已歼灭敌军七十三万六千余人（内美军三十二万二千余人），击落击伤敌机七千八百架以上。中朝人民部队愈战愈强，敌人在兵员和物资方面的损失消耗愈来愈大，士气愈来愈低，内部矛盾愈来愈深的事实，已经为世界所公认了。虽然如此，虽然中朝方面在板门店谈判中，苏联代表在联合国大会中，都再三提出和平解决朝鲜问题的合理方案，而美国侵略者却仍然拒绝和平。美国侵略者及其合作者坚持要强迫扣留中朝被俘人员，坚持要继续战争，并且积极阴谋扩大侵略。这种情况，不能不引起我国人民的严重警惕。因此，我国人民在一九五三年内必须继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，准备粉碎敌人在任何地方以任何方法进行的进攻和袭击，争取新的更大的胜利，同时继续争取朝鲜问题的公正合理的和平解决。在我国境内，必须大大地加强国防力量，加强公安工作和民兵工作，坚决迅速地肃清敌人派来的特务土匪，以巩固抗美援朝的后方，保证国家建设事业的顺利进行。
    一九五三年将是我国进入大规模建设的第一年。在继续加强抗美援朝的条件下，大规模建设是否可能呢？答复是肯定的。在过去两年中，我国人民曾以极大力量投入抗美援朝的斗争，但是这并没有妨碍反而加速了我国经济恢复工作的完成和财经状况的根本好转。一九五二年的工农业总产值比一九四九年增加了百分之六十五，主要的工业产品（除煤还略少外）和农产品都超过了战前年产量的最高水平。据初步统计，以解放前最高年产量为一○○，则生铁为一○五，钢锭为一七○，煤为九五，电力为一一四，水泥为一五三，棉纱为一五○，棉布为一六五，造纸为二一二，粮食为一○九，棉花为一五五。我国的财政收支已经完全平衡。社会主义性质的国家经济在工业上和商业上都已经确定地取得领导地位。一切这些，都为国家的大规模建设准备了良好的条件。
    国家建设包括经济建设、国防建设和文化建设，而以经济建设为基础。经济建设的总任务就是要使中国由落后的农业国逐步变为强大的工业国，而要达到这个目的，就必须首先着重发展冶金、燃料、电力、机械制造、化学等项重工业，因为正如斯大林同志在“第一个五年计划的总结”中所说，“只有重工业才能既改造并推进整个工业，又改造并推进运输业，又改造并推进农业”。工业化——这是我国人民百年来梦寐以求的理想，这是我国人民不再受帝国主义欺侮不再过穷困生活的基本保证，因此这是全国人民的最高利益。全国人民必须同心同德，为这个最高利益而积极奋斗。
    我国的工业化的速度需要大大超过任何资本主义国家所曾经历的速度，而采取苏联和各人民民主国家在工业化和工业发展过程中所采取的那种高速度。这种速度之所以可能，是由于我国是人民民主主义的国家，我们的国家建设和我国全体人民的利益完全一致，其目的是在于不断提高我国人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平，并巩固国防和保卫和平，因而我国人民在执行建设计划时能够充分发挥自己的劳动积极性和创造性。这种速度之所以可能，还由于我们有伟大的盟友苏联的慷慨无私的援助和苏联先进经验的指导，以及各人民民主国家和爱好和平的世界人民的支持。
    为了实现伟大的国家建设计划，首先需要我国工人阶级的积极努力。我国的一切公私企业中的工人，工程技术人员，工业、建筑业和交通运输业管理人员，都应该广泛开展爱国主义的生产竞赛，学习先进的工作方法和先进的科学技术，进一步挖掘潜在力量，把一切可能利用的条件都充分利用起来，加强企业的技术管理，改善企业的经营，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，为完成、提前完成和超额完成生产计划、基本建设计划和交通运输计划而斗争。
    在我国的工业化过程中，我国的农业也需要迅速发展。全国农民应该根据自愿和互利的原则，进一步地组织起来，有步骤地发展和提高农业劳动互助和生产合作运动，学习新的农业技术，兴修水利，保持水土，防止水旱灾和病虫害，努力提高单位面积产量，完成和超额完成增产计划。
    国营商业、合作社和私营商业都应该努力作好物资交流的工作，为工农业的建设计划和人民的生活需要服务。国营商业和合作社都应该改善经营方法，切实地实行经济核算制，缩短资金周转时间，减少商业流转费用。
    国家的文化教育事业必须积极适应经济建设和国防建设的需要。必须大量地培养各种程度的建设人材，教育青年、学生和知识分子加紧学习技术，学习科学。必须继续提高青年和全体人民的政治觉悟。必须帮助妇女打破封建束缚，取得平等地位，以便壮大工农业生产的队伍。
    国家建设的各个方面都需要资金，而我们的资金是有限的。因此，全国人民和全国一切工作人员，都必须重视资金的来源和资金的正确使用问题。为了保证国家建设的投资，就必须有重点地使用资金，把资金主要用在对国家命运最有决定意义的事业上面，即重工业的建设和国防建设方面，反对百废俱兴，反对要在短期内把一切“好事”都办完的观点。为了保证国家建设的投资，必须继续厉行节约，精打细算，把能节省的每一文钱都用到建设上来，向铺张浪费，不计算成本以及供给制观点进行坚决无情的斗争。
    领导干部问题在国家建设问题中占有最重要的地位。斯大林同志曾经说：“任何一个任务，特别是像我们国家工业化这样的巨大任务，没有生气勃勃的人，没有新的人，没有新的建设干部，是不可能实行的。……现在我们需要的是新的工业指挥干部，是优秀的工厂经理，是优秀的托拉斯经理，能干的商人，聪明的工业建设的设计师，……任务是在于造就这些干部，把他们提到前列，给他们以各方面的扶助。”（论苏联经济形势与党的政策）斯大林同志又说：“什么是领导生产呢？……使我们丢脸的，就是甚至在我们布尔什维克中间，也有不少的人是专靠签署文件来进行领导的。……要我们自己变成专门家，变成工作内行，要我们自己转而努力学习技术知识，——这就是实际生活推动我们来干的事情。”（论经济工作人员的任务）“为了实现新式领导，就要怎么办呢？……就要我们经济工作领导者不是‘一般地’领导企业，不是‘从空中’领导企业，而是具体切实地领导企业；就要他们不是根据一般空谈，而是以严格求实态度来对待每一个问题；就要他们不限于纸上敷衍搪塞或一般辞藻和口号，而要精通工作技术，熟悉工作详情，熟悉‘小事情’，因为现在大事情是由‘小事情’积成的。”（新的环境和新的经济建设任务）我们目前的任务也正是如此。为了实现国家建设计划，就必须造就和提拔大批的优秀的建设干部，同时要求一切建设事业的领导者不要依靠签署文件来进行“一般”的领导，而要具体和切实地领导企业，而要变成专门家和工作内行。只有这样，我们的国家建设事业的正确进行才能够得到保证。
    我国既已胜利地结束了经济恢复时期而进入了大规模建设时期，按照共同纲领的规定，就应当召集全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，选举中央和地方的人民政府。在全国人民代表大会上，将要通过宪法和国家建设计划。毫无疑问，这将要成为我国人民政治生活中的巨大事件。
    在过去三年多的时间中，由于进行巨大的社会政治改革和经济恢复的工作，实行人民代表大会制度的条件还不具备，我国采取了由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议代行全国人民代表大会职权、而由地方各级人民代表会议逐步代行地方各级人民代表大会职权的办法。同时，由于还没有制定宪法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领暂时代替了宪法的一部分作用。这些在过去是完全必要的并且完成了历史任务的过渡的办法，已经不适合现在建设时期的需要了。全国绝大多数人民在经过了土地改革和其他社会改革以后，已经具备了实行选举自己的政府的条件。从现在起，就应当在人民群众中间进行最广泛的宣传，告诉人民认真地准备这次选举，以便把人民所真正满意和认为必要的人选举做代表和人民政府的委员，而不要让任何坏分子混入人民的政权机关。人民的民主权利的充分发挥，将更密切人民政府和人民群众之间的联系，将大大提高人民群众的革命积极性和劳动积极性，而这正是我国建设计划得以顺利实现的最重要条件之一。
    一九五三年的任务是巨大的。完成一九五三年的任务，整个五年计划就有了良好的开端和基础，这对于今后四年的工作是有决定意义的。毫无疑问，一切公开的和暗藏的敌人都会要用种种方法破坏我们的事业，我们还会遇到各色各样的困难，但是我们必须战胜这些障碍而取得胜利。我们记得，在过去三年多的短短时间中，我国人民在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的英明领导之下，在苏联的大力支援之下，曾经解决了过去千百年所不能解决的问题，使我们的祖国从悲惨的黑暗地狱中顿然走到了充满阳光和希望的人间世界。我们胜利地完成了国家的统一，完成了土地改革，进行了抗美援朝的斗争和镇压反革命的斗争，肃清了帝国主义在中国的残余势力，巩固了国内各民族的团结，调整了工商业，稳定了物价，平衡了财政收支，进行了反对贪污、浪费、官僚主义和反对行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，开展了增产节约运动，完成了经济的恢复工作。由此可见，有毛泽东同志的领导和斯大林同志的援助的四万万七千五百万人民的正义事业，是无往而不胜的。全国各阶层各民族人民应当团结一致，为新的更伟大的胜利而奋斗。
