    New York Dockworkers Strike
    Bus Drivers' Strike Continues
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 6th] New York dispatch: Weighers, crane operators, and sample inspectors at New York docks, belonging to the International Longshoremen's Association of the American Federation of Labor, went on strike on the 2nd, demanding wage increases. Other dockworkers respected the picket lines set up by the striking workers and refused to cross them. The strike has prevented ships docked in the Port of New York from loading and unloading cargo. By the 4th, almost half of the docks in the Port of New York had been paralyzed. According to a report by the Associated Press on the 3rd, cargo transportation in other East Coast ports such as Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore has also been affected by the strike.

    [Xinhua News Agency, January 4th] New York dispatch: Eight thousand two hundred bus drivers and mechanics belonging to the Transport Workers Union of America (CIO), went on strike on eight bus lines in New York City on New Year's Day, 1953, demanding that management shorten working hours and increase wages. The strike began at midnight on January 1st and was still continuing on the 3rd. All buses on the eight routes in New York have been completely shut down, seriously affecting transportation in this largest city in America, precisely during the New Year period. These eight bus routes usually carry 3.5 million passengers daily, accounting for one-fifth of the entire population of New York State. The New York municipal authorities have been greatly embarrassed by this strike.

    纽约码头工人罢工
    公共汽车司机罢工继续进行
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：美国劳联国际码头工人联合会所属纽约码头的过磅员、天秤员和样品检查员在二日举行罢工，要求增加工资。其他的码头工人尊重罢工工人设立的纠察线，拒绝越过。罢工使停舶在纽约港口的船只无法装卸货物，至四日止，纽约港口的几乎半数码头已陷于瘫痪。据美联社三日电称，波士顿、费城、巴尔的摩等其他东海岸港口的货运也已遭受罢工影响。
    【新华社四日讯】纽约消息：美国产联运输工人工会所属八千二百名公共汽车司机和机械士，于一九五三年元旦在纽约市八条公共汽车线上举行罢工，要求资方缩短工时和增加工资。罢工从一月一日零时开始，到三日仍在继续进行。纽约八条路线的公共汽车已全部停驶，使美国这个最大都市的交通恰好在新年期间受到严重影响。这八条公共汽车路线上通常每天有乘客三百五十万人，占纽约州全州人口的五分之一。纽约市政当局已因这次罢工而大感狼狈。
