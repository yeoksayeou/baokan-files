Editor's Note: In late October 1952, the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Beijing Film Studio, and this newspaper jointly formed a working group to participate in the "Lushan County Marriage Law Implementation Model Representative Conference" in Lushan County, Henan Province, and to study the implementation of the Marriage Law in Lushan County and its experience. The experience of Lushan County in implementing the Marriage Law is now compiled and published below.

How Lushan County, Henan Province Implemented the Marriage Law

Lushan County, Henan Province, divided the county into three types of townships according to the degree of implementation of the Marriage Law. The first type included fifty-four townships, characterized by the fact that the Marriage Law had been publicized to every household, the masses had a correct understanding of the Marriage Law, freedom of marriage had been realized, and a large number of model couples and democratic families had emerged. The second type included ninety-six townships, characterized by the fact that the publicity work was well done, the masses had a certain understanding of the Marriage Law, but it was not comprehensive or profound enough, arranged marriages had disappeared, and there were fewer model couples and democratic families than in the first type of townships. The third type included thirty-eight townships, characterized by the fact that the publicity of the Marriage Law was not widespread or deep enough, some cadres and the masses still had ideological resistance to the Marriage Law, and individual cases of forced arranged marriages and infanticide still existed. Generally speaking, out of the one hundred and eighty-eight townships in Lushan County, one hundred and fifty townships had eradicated arranged marriages and realized freedom of marriage. In the past two years or so, more than four thousand six hundred new couples have freely married in the county; more than three thousand seven hundred couples have divorced after mediation failed due to incompatibility; more than five hundred widows have remarried and are living happily. The phenomenon of beating and abusing women has disappeared in most areas. A new atmosphere has emerged in society. Social interaction between men and women has become a public and legal activity in most areas. Young people no longer consider it a shameful thing, and older people no longer interfere. The barbaric and backward feudal "family rules" have been broken, and the social venues for young men and women have gradually increased. They usually meet each other in mutual aid groups, people's schools, theater troupes, training courses, representative meetings, cooperatives, and party and league organizational activities. Young men and women in love can freely interact in front of their parents, and even the man can eat at the woman's house or the woman at the man's house.

In the past, engagements arranged by parents, especially after the democratic movement in the winter of 1951 following the promulgation of the Marriage Law, many girls proposed to dissolve the engagement, or went to the groom's family to understand the man and his family's situation. There were also men who went to the woman's house to see. If they didn't like each other, they dissolved the engagement, and if they liked each other, they continued until marriage. Most parents, because they understood the benefits of the Marriage Law, expressed their agreement with their children's demands and practices. This situation is relatively common.

Loving labor, loving progress, and loving learning have become the main conditions for young people to look for marriage partners. Therefore, the implementation of the Marriage Law has further promoted the enthusiasm and initiative of young people to demand progress. An increasing number of young people are responding to the call of the Communist Party and the Youth League, striving to learn politics and culture, and striving to be models in all aspects of labor production. Among those striving for progress, Party members and Youth League members are playing a leading role.

Because young men and women have a correct view of marriage and love, and have the right to be independent and voluntary, their lives after marriage are generally very happy, and a large number of model couples and democratic and harmonious families have emerged throughout the county. Of the ninety-nine model couples and eleven model families who participated in the "Marriage Law Implementation Model Representative Conference" at the end of October 1952, the vast majority were couples who married freely. The total number of model couples participating in this conference was one hundred and eighty-seven (some couples only sent one person due to circumstances), of which one hundred and thirty-three were Youth League members and nine were Communist Party members.

As a result of the implementation of the Marriage Law, old family relationships have generally changed. According to statistics from Posuo Township (second type township), there are a total of five hundred and thirty-nine households in the township, of which seventy-six are democratic and harmonious families, accounting for 14.1% of the total number of households; twenty-one are unharmonious families, accounting for 3.9% of the total number of households; and four hundred and forty-two are general families, accounting for 82% of the total number of households. In general families, the phenomenon of beating and abusing women has been eliminated, and basic equality in food and clothing has been achieved. According to statistics from Wanglou Village, Shiqiao Township (first type township), with one hundred and eighty-five households, democratic and harmonious families account for 25%, and unharmonious families account for just over 0.5%. Bao Tonghua of Ranghe Township had not lived with her husband for eleven years, but reconciled after the promulgation of the Marriage Law and was rated as a model family. There are also some members of old families who had not spoken to each other for several years, but are now speaking.

Due to the realization of freedom of marriage and the increase in model couples and harmonious families, the masses' patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have increased significantly compared to the past. Women are no less active than men in various movements. For example, in the 1951 donation of weapons movement, the Lushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to "donate a fighter plane," and women alone donated 510 million yuan. During the Huai River project in the winter of 1951, many women actively mobilized their husbands to participate, telling them not to worry about the family. Shortly after the migrant workers left, more than sixty fiancées in the sixth and eighth districts wrote letters to their fiancés on the Huai River front, encouraging them to strive to return as models. Liu Shuxian of the sixth district and her fiancé Zhao Guangfa had already chosen a wedding date. When the task of controlling the Huai River came, Liu Shuxian immediately gave up the idea of getting married and mobilized her fiancé to go to the Huai River. After her fiancé left, she wrote to him and said, "If the Huai River is not controlled, don't come back. I won't marry you even if you come back!" Under Liu Shuxian's encouragement, Zhao Guangfa worked even harder and finally won the title of model. Now, they have been selected as the county's first-class model couple. Women have also played an active role in the Great Production Movement. According to statistics, women participate in all of the county's six thousand five hundred and seventy-nine mutual aid groups. Especially in the 1952 drought resistance, because many men went to control the Huai River, women became an important force. According to the estimate of the township cadres of Posuo Township in the sixth district, women planted at least eight hectares of the township's twenty hectares of land. Women who have turned over are even more eager to study culture. According to statistics, of the 56,451 people attending people's schools in the county in 1951, 29,321 were women, exceeding the number of men. From the above situation, it can be seen that when men and women have equal political and economic status, their role in the country's construction and the creation of happy families is equally great.

What are some important experiences of Lushan County in implementing the Marriage Law?

(1) Lushan County paid great attention to the publicity and education of cadres and the masses in the implementation of the Marriage Law. In the publicity, all agencies and departments acted together, using all occasions and all publicity forces to conduct publicity regularly and tirelessly. The grassroots organizations of the Communist Party and the Youth League at the district and township levels often explained the Marriage Law when giving Party and League lessons, calling on Communist Party members and Youth League members to become models in implementing the Marriage Law. The county and district people's governments regarded the implementation of the Marriage Law as a content item whenever they deployed central work. The Marriage Law was also often discussed at township meetings. The People's Cultural Center, the county high school, and the normal school also frequently carried out publicity in this regard. When issuing land certificates, emphasis was placed on publicizing "husbands and wives have equal ownership and disposal rights over family property"; the implementation of the Marriage Law was also promoted in connection with major festivals. Special attention was paid to the use of rural theater troupes and propagandists.

Rural theater troupes play a significant role in the cultural and entertainment life of the rural masses today. Each program it performs can attract and influence most of the masses. Another characteristic of Lushan's rural theater troupes is its mass character and universality. There are currently two hundred and forty theater troupes in the county (at least one in each township), and programs publicizing the Marriage Law accounted for a quarter of the programs performed by these theater troupes in the past two years. Most of the actors are advanced young men and women in rural areas. The content of the dramas is progressive and the form of expression is vivid, and they are all true stories, so they can move the masses. Wu Shuyu, a young widow in Cheng'guan District, had been "observing chastity" for sixteen years since her husband died at the age of eighteen. After watching a play about a widow remarrying, her thinking gradually changed, and she later married.

There are more than three thousand propagandists in the county, spread throughout every rural area. These people are all Party members and Youth League members. They use various forms, such as "broadcasting stations," reading groups, blackboard newspapers, market fairs, and meal piles, to publicize the Marriage Law to the masses. In the publicity, many outstanding model propagandists emerged. For example, Sun Fengyi took dry food to Yangligou Township (more than ten miles away from the village where he lived) to publicize. There are few households in the mountains, and it is not easy to gather people, so he went from house to house to publicize. It took four days and publicized forty-seven villages, crossing mountains and ridges, and wearing out a pair of sneakers.

There are many reasons why Lushan County was able to publicize the Marriage Law to every household in most areas, but the role played by rural theater troupes and propagandists is the greatest.

(2) Fully mobilize women. To mobilize women to participate in various central tasks is an important condition for completing the central tasks; and to mobilize women to participate in various central tasks, it is necessary to solve women's personal problems at the same time - the problem of freedom of marriage. This is the most profound experience gained by Lushan County in implementing the Marriage Law. The Lushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China realized the importance of mobilizing women in the anti-hegemonism movement long before the promulgation of the Marriage Law. According to the county party secretary, "When mobilizing the masses to complain about their suffering in the anti-hegemonism movement, it was found that women suffered the most and hated the most. If women did not participate in the complaint meetings, the meetings would not be successful. The same is true for the struggle. If women do not participate, it will appear to be powerless. Therefore, from that time on, the slogan and requirement of 'mobilizing men and women together' was put forward. Subsequent experience has proved that after women are mobilized, they play an extremely important role in major movements such as land reform, production, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the anti-American and aid-Korea movement, the democratic movement, and drought resistance."

To mobilize women at the same time, it is first necessary to make resolutions at various representative meetings. The most important link is to make a resolution at the Party Congress, calling on Party members and Youth League members to resolutely implement the resolution. As long as Party members and Youth League members can take the lead, the general masses can be mobilized.

In mobilizing women, it is necessary to discover and cultivate a large number of women activists, and at the same time promote a large number of women cadres to participate in the grassroots (village, township, district) organizations of Party and government organs on this basis. Generally speaking, women cadres are more concerned and work harder than male cadres in implementing the Marriage Law. Therefore, they can play a greater role in implementing the Marriage Law. There are now five hundred and sixty female Communist Party members and two thousand seven hundred and forty-nine female Youth League members in Lushan County. A large number of women also participate in the grassroots organizations of the government, including one hundred and eighty-six female deputy township chiefs, five female township chiefs, three hundred and eighty-four female township government members, and one female district chief. These advanced elements and grassroots cadres are not only leaders in various movements, but also the backbone of implementing the Marriage Law.

(3) Lushan County implemented the Marriage Law in various central tasks, especially in the democratic movement in the winter of 1951. In this movement, by mobilizing the masses, including the elderly, to complain about the suffering of the feudal marriage system, they recognized the harm of the feudal marriage system and the benefits of the Marriage Law, and eliminated some of the past concerns, misunderstandings, and ideological resistance to the implementation of the Marriage Law. Therefore, the democratic movement left a very deep impression on the minds of the masses in Lushan. Many people always say when they talk, "Since the democratic movement, my family has become harmonious!" After the democratic movement, the Marriage Law was truly and universally implemented among the masses in Lushan County.

The main content of the democratic movement was to solve the problem of unity within the people, that is, to improve various relationships, such as the relationship between the Party and the masses, cadres and the masses, village and village, household and household, and people and people. At the beginning of the movement, complaint meetings were generally held. When complaining about marital pain, the abused daughter-in-law was initially worried and dared not complain. Therefore, women who had more suffering and fewer worries and divorced women were first mobilized to complain. In order to avoid increasing disputes within the people, some townships focused on mobilizing women who were divorced in other townships and freely married in this township, as well as women whose husbands' families were in other townships to complain. The elderly were also mobilized to complain about the suffering of the feudal marriage system. Old women complained about the suffering of foot binding, being beaten and abused, enduring widowhood, being child brides, or being concubines; old men complained about the suffering of being bachelors, or the suffering of being in debt or even going bankrupt because of marrying a wife. In this way, the elderly hated the feudal marriage system. Then, when the Marriage Law was publicized to them, they quickly understood the benefits of the Marriage Law. When mobilizing the masses to complain about the suffering of the feudal marriage system, it is necessary to pay attention to grasping that the relationship between family members should not tend to be adversarial, but should guide the masses to trace the root cause of the suffering to the system of the old society. Afterwards, when carrying out the people's internal democratic unity, in addition to holding meetings between households, between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses to solve the existing problems, all townships generally held family meetings to specifically solve the problems existing in the old families. Several families with small populations held joint meetings, and families with large populations held separate meetings. District and township cadres selected key points to participate in and guide them, and Party members and Youth League members played a leading role in them. At this time, the slogan of "equality between men and women, unity and patriotism, harmonious production, and democratic management of the family" was put forward, and the method of "untangling knots" was used to solve the problems existing in the family. Many elderly people made self-criticisms at family meetings, and young people also proposed to respect the elderly. Afterwards, families signed patriotic and abundant production covenants and established democratic systems, such as holding regular family meetings. In this way, the old family relations gradually changed. According to statistics, Yu Village Township solved the disputes of twenty-eight families in the democratic movement; Hu Ying Township solved twenty-seven families; Da Wang Village Township solved more than twenty families; Xu Ying Township solved fifteen families; and general townships solved two or thirty families. On the other hand, those who should have divorced were not resolved before the democratic movement, and were also resolved during and after the movement. For example, in Dong Village Township, a child bride named Li Xiuzhen proposed a divorce before the democratic movement, but it was not resolved for three months (the cadres said that "eight conditions" needed to be met); others who should have divorced did not dare to mention it, so there was not a single divorce in the township after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. After the democratic movement, Li Xiuzhen's problem was solved, and then there were fourteen divorces and seventeen dissolutions of feudal engagements. After the democratic movement, there was also an increase in free association and marriage between men and women. There were six hundred and ninety free marriages, five hundred and eleven divorces, and one hundred and twenty-eight widow remarriages in the county during the democratic movement. The success of combining the democratic movement with the implementation of the Marriage Law was mainly because the Marriage Law was universally and deeply rooted in families, and on the basis of the whole family's consciousness, the old feudal "family rules" were gradually changed, existing disputes were resolved, and a democratic atmosphere was established in the family.

(4) Lushan County is good at using the method of commending models in various tasks, and this is also the case in the implementation of the Marriage Law. The Party and government leading organs of Lushan County, in view of the fact that freedom of marriage has been basically realized for more than two years, and the number of model cadres, model couples, and model families is increasing day by day, convened the county's "Marriage Law Implementation Model Representative Conference" on October 25, 1952, in order to establish a banner and point out the direction for the implementation of the Marriage Law. The model representatives who participated in the conference were all selected by the masses in each township. Each township carried out publicity work on the Marriage Law before the selection. The participants included ninety-nine model couples, eleven model families, and nineteen model cadres, and each township also had one to two representatives of unmarried youth, for a total of four hundred and ten representatives. The representatives introduced their experiences to each other at the meeting and reported their model deeds. Finally, after everyone's discussion, twenty-two model couples, three model families, two model cadres, and two model townships were selected to establish a banner for the implementation of the Marriage Law in the county. Among the model families, some were old families that had been discordant for many years but are now better, and some were one unharmonious family that turned into two harmonious families after divorce. The establishment of these banners educated the masses with living facts, making the broad masses more wholeheartedly support the Marriage Law and creating favorable conditions for further implementation of the Marriage Law.

The reason why Lushan County was able to do so much work and achieve better results in implementing the Marriage Law is that the Lushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China's emphasis on the Marriage Law is of decisive significance. The county party committee educated all cadres, all party members and all Youth League members to play a leading and backbone role in the implementation and enforcement of the Marriage Law. Those Party members and Youth League members whose thinking was not clear first cleared their thinking internally, eliminated concerns, and established a correct view and attitude towards the Marriage Law. This ensured the consistency, enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in the actual actions of Party members and Youth League members. The County Women's Federation and the County People's Court also actively supported the just struggle of the masses in the work of implementing the Marriage Law, and the County People's Court ensured the timely handling of marriage cases. Without these, the above achievements would not have been possible.

    编者按：一九五二年十月下旬，中央人民政府政治法律委员会、内务部、司法部、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、北京电影制片厂及本报曾共同组成工作组赴河南省鲁山县参加“鲁山县贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会”，并研究了鲁山县贯彻婚姻法的情况及经验。现将鲁山县贯彻婚姻法的经验整理出来，发表于后。
    河南省鲁山县是怎样贯彻执行婚姻法的
    河南省鲁山县根据婚姻法贯彻的程度，把全县分为三类乡。一类乡共五十四个，特点是婚姻法宣传得家喻户晓，群众对婚姻法有了正确的认识，婚姻自由已经实现，模范夫妻与民主家庭大量出现。二类乡共九十六个，特点是宣传工作做得还好，群众对婚姻法有了认识，但不够全面、深刻，包办婚姻已绝迹，模范夫妻与民主家庭不如一类乡多。三类乡共三十八个，特点是婚姻法宣传得不够普遍深入，某些干部和群众对婚姻法在思想上还有抵触，个别强迫包办婚姻和溺婴的现象还存在。总的来说，鲁山全县一百八十八个乡中已经有了一百五十个乡根绝了包办婚姻，实现了婚姻自由。两年多来，全县自由结婚的新夫妇有四千六百多对；双方感情不合经调解无效而离婚的有三千七百多对；有五百多个寡妇已改嫁，过着美满生活。打骂和虐待妇女的现象，在大部分地区已经没有了。社会上出现一片新气象。男女社会交际在大部分地区已成为公开合法的活动，青年人们再不认为这是羞耻事，老年人也不再从中阻拦，野蛮落后的封建“家规”被打破了，青年男女的社交场所逐渐增多。他们互相认识的地方通常是在互助组、民校、剧团、训练班、代表会、合作社以及党、团的组织生活中。在恋爱中的青年男女，可以当着父母的面自由往来，甚至男方在女家或女方在男家吃饭。
    过去包办订婚的，在婚姻法颁布后，特别是在一九五一年冬民主运动之后，许多女孩子提出解除婚约，或到婆家去了解男方及其家庭的情况。也有男的到女方家去看的。看不中就解除婚约，看得中就好下去，直到结婚。大部分做父母的由于懂得了婚姻法的好处，对子女的这种要求与做法表示同意。这种情形是比较普遍的。
    爱劳动、爱进步、爱学习已成为一般青年物色婚姻对象的主要条件。因此婚姻法的实行，更推动了青年们要求进步的热情与积极性。响应共产党和青年团的号召，努力学习政治和文化，争取在劳动生产等各方面作模范的青年日益增多。在争取进步的人们中，党、团员起着带头作用。
    由于青年男女们有了正确的婚姻观和恋爱观，又有了自主自愿的权利，所以他们在结婚以后的生活一般都很美满，全县出现了大量的模范夫妻和民主和睦家庭。参加一九五二年十月底“贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会”的九十九对模范夫妻和十一户模范家庭，其中绝大部分是自由结婚的夫妇。参加这次大会的模范夫妇总人数为一百八十七人（有的夫妇因事只来了一人），其中青年团员一百三十三个，共产党员九个。
    贯彻婚姻法的结果，旧的家庭关系一般都起了变化。根据婆娑乡（二类乡）的统计，全乡共五百三十九户，其中民主和睦家庭有七十六户，占总户数的百分之十四点一；不和睦的家庭有二十一户，占总户数的百分之三点九；一般家庭共四百四十二户，占总户数的百分之八十二。一般家庭中已消灭了打骂和虐待妇女的现象，基本上做到了吃穿平等。又据石桥乡（一类乡）王楼村一百八十五户的统计，民主和睦家庭占百分之二十五，不和睦的家庭只占百分之零点五强。瀼河乡暴同花十一年不与丈夫同居，婚姻法颁布后又和好了，被评为模范家庭。还有一些旧家庭中的成员，几年来互不说话，现在也说话了。
    由于婚姻自由的实现，模范夫妻与和睦家庭的增多，群众的爱国热情和生产热情较前有了显著的增高。妇女群众在各种运动中都不亚于男人。如一九五一年捐献武器运动中，中共鲁山县委发出“捐一架战斗机”的号召，仅妇女就捐了五亿一千万元。一九五一年冬治淮时，许多妇女都积极动员丈夫前往参加，叫他们不要念家。治淮民工走后不久，仅第六、第八两个区就有六十多个未婚妻给治淮前线上的未婚夫写信，勉励他们争取模范回来。第六区刘淑贤和她的未婚夫赵光发，已经择好了结婚的日子，临结婚时，治淮的任务来了，刘淑贤立刻放弃了结婚的念头，动员未婚夫去治淮。未婚夫走后，她又给他写信说：“淮河一天不治好，你就别回来，回来也不和你结婚！”赵光发在刘淑贤的鼓励下，劳动更加积极，终于争得了模范。现在，他们被选为全县的一等模范夫妻。在大生产运动中，妇女也起了积极的作用。据统计：全县六千五百七十九个互助组中，都有妇女参加。特别在一九五二年抗旱中，因为许多男人去治淮，妇女成了重要的力量。据六区婆娑乡乡干部的估计，全乡二十顷地中，至少有八顷地是妇女点种的。翻了身的妇女，学习文化的要求更为迫切。据统计，一九五一年全县上民校的五万六千四百五十一人中，妇女有二万九千三百二十一人，超过了男人。从以上情况可以看出：当男女的政治与经济地位平等了的时候，他们在祖国的建设事业中和创造幸福的家庭中所起的作用是一样巨大的。
    鲁山县在贯彻婚姻法中有些什么重要的经验呢？
    （一）鲁山县在贯彻婚姻法中非常注意对干部、群众的宣传教育工作。在宣传中，各机关、各部门一齐动手，通过一切场合，运用一切宣传力量，经常地不疲倦地进行宣传。区、乡共产党和青年团的基层组织，上党课、团课时，经常讲解婚姻法，号召共产党员和青年团员要成为贯彻婚姻法的模范。县、区人民政府每当布置中心工作时，都把贯彻婚姻法当作一项内容。乡里开大会时也常讲婚姻法。人民文化馆、县立中学和师范也经常进行这方面的宣传。颁发土地证时，就强调宣传“夫妇双方对于家庭财产有平等的所有权与处理权”；每逢重大节日，也都联系贯彻婚姻法进行宣传。宣传时，特别注意了运用农村剧团和宣传员的力量。
    农村剧团，当前在农村群众文化娱乐生活中有重大作用。它演出的每个节目，能够吸引并影响大部分群众。鲁山的农村剧团还有一个特点，就是它的群众性和普遍性。全县现有剧团二百四十个（每乡至少有一个），这些剧团二年来所演出的节目中，宣传婚姻法的占四分之一。演员大部都是农村中先进的青年男女。戏剧的内容是进步的，表现形式是生动的，都是真人真事，所以能感动群众。城关区有一位年轻寡妇吴淑玉，从十八岁死了丈夫就“守节”，整守了十六年。在看过一幕寡妇改嫁的剧后，思想逐渐变了，以后嫁了人。
    宣传员全县一共有三千多名，遍布于每个农村，这些人都是党、团员。他们利用各种形式，诸如“广播台”、读报组、黑板报、集市、饭堆等等，向群众宣传婚姻法。在宣传中出现了不少特出的模范宣传员。如孙逢仪带着干粮到杨李沟乡（离他住的村十来里）去宣传。山里家户少，不好集合，他就挨户串门子宣传。历时四天，共宣传了四十七个庄，翻山越岭，跑破一双运动鞋。
    鲁山县所以能在大部分地区把婚姻法宣传到家喻户晓，原因很多，但农村剧团和宣传员在其中所起的作用是最大的。
    （二）充分发动妇女。在进行各种中心工作中要发动妇女参加，这是完成中心工作的重要条件；而要发动妇女起来参加各种中心工作，就必须同时解决妇女的切身问题——婚姻自由问题。这是鲁山县在贯彻婚姻法中得到的一个最深刻的经验。中共鲁山县委远在婚姻法颁布以前的反恶霸运动中，就体会到发动妇女的重要。据县委书记说：“在反恶霸运动中发动群众诉苦时，就发现妇女的苦最深，仇恨最大，诉苦会如果没有妇女参加，就开不好。斗争时也一样，如果没有妇女参加，就显得没有力量。因之，从那时起就提出了‘男女一起发动’的口号和要求。以后的经验证明：妇女发动起来以后，不论在土地改革、生产、镇压反革命、抗美援朝运动、民主运动、抗旱等大的运动中，都起了极其重要的作用。”
    要把妇女也同时发动起来，首先就要在各种代表会议上做出决议。其中最重要的一环，是在党代表大会上做出决议，号召党、团员坚决执行决议。只要党、团员都能带头，一般群众就可以带动起来。
    在发动妇女中，必须发现和培养大批的妇女积极分子，同时在这个基础上提拔大批的妇女干部参加党政机关的基层（村、乡、区）组织。一般地说，对于贯彻婚姻法，妇女干部比男干部更加关心和努力。因此她们能在贯彻婚姻法中起更大的作用。现在鲁山全县有五百六十个女共产党员，二千七百四十九个女青年团员。在政府的基层组织内也有大批的妇女参加，计有一百八十六个女副乡长，五个女正乡长，三百八十四个女乡政府委员，一个女区长。这些先进分子和基层干部不仅是各种运动中的带头者，更是贯彻婚姻法的骨干。
    （三）鲁山县在各种中心工作中贯彻了婚姻法，特别是在一九五一年冬民主运动中贯彻得最好。在这个运动中，由于发动群众包括老年人诉封建婚姻制度之苦，使他们认清了封建婚姻制度的害处和婚姻法的好处，而消除了过去对实行婚姻法的某些顾虑、误解和思想抵触。因此，民主运动在鲁山群众的思想中留下了很深刻的印象。许多人谈起话来总是说：“自从民主运动以后，我家和好了！”经过民主运动，婚姻法在鲁山县便真正普遍深入地贯彻到群众中去了。
    民主运动的主要内容是解决人民内部的团结问题，即改善各种关系，如党和群众、干部和群众、村与村、户与户、人与人的关系。运动开始，普遍举行了诉苦会。诉到婚姻痛苦的时候，受虐待的媳妇开始时有顾虑，不敢诉。因此，就先发动苦多顾虑少的妇女和离过婚的诉苦。为了避免增加人民内部的纠纷，有些乡着重发动在外乡离婚、又在本乡自由结婚的，以及婆家在外乡的妇女诉苦。也发动老年人诉封建婚姻制度之苦。老太婆们诉说缠足、受打骂、熬寡、当童养媳或作妾之苦；老头有诉光棍苦的，有诉因娶媳妇而负债甚至破产的苦的。这样，老年人对封建婚姻制度痛恨起来。然后向他们宣传婚姻法，他们也就很快懂得了婚姻法的好处。在发动群众诉封建婚姻制度之苦的时候，必须注意掌握不要使家庭成员的关系趋于对立，而应引导群众把苦的根源追到旧社会的制度上。之后，在进行人民内部民主大团结时，各乡除了召开户与户、党与群众、干部与群众等会议解决相互间所存在的问题以外，普遍地召开了家庭会议，专门解决旧家庭中存在的问题。人口少的几家合开，人口多的单独开。区、乡干部选择重点分头参加指导，党、团员在其中起带头作用。这时提出“男女平等、团结爱国、和睦生产、民主管理家庭”的口号，并用“解疙疸”的办法来解决家庭中存在的问题。许多老年人在家庭会议上做了检讨，青年人也提出要尊重老年人。之后，家庭订立爱国丰产公约，树立民主制度，如定期召开家庭会等。这样，旧的家庭关系就逐渐改变了。据统计，余庄乡在民主运动中解决了二十八户家庭的纠纷；虎营乡解决了二十七户；大王庄乡解决了二十多户；徐营乡解决了十五户；一般乡都是二、三十户。另一方面，应该离婚的，在民主运动以前没有得到解决，在民主运动中和运动后也解决了。如东庄乡在民主运动以前，有一个叫李秀贞的童养媳提出离婚，三个月没有得到解决
    （干部说需要够“八个条件”）；其他该离的也不敢提了，因此该乡在婚姻法颁布后，一个离婚的也没有。民主运动以后，李秀贞的问题解决了，跟着就有十四个离婚和十七个解除封建婚约的。在民主运动之后，男女自由交际与结婚的也增多了。全县在民主运动中自由结婚的有六百九十对，离婚的五百十一对，寡妇改嫁的一百二十八人。民主运动中结合贯彻婚姻法之所以成功，主要是把婚姻法普遍深入到家庭中，在全家自觉的基础上，逐渐改变着旧的封建“家规”，解决了现存的纠纷，在家庭中树立了民主的风气。
    （四）鲁山县在各种工作中，善于利用表扬模范的办法，在贯彻婚姻法中也是如此。鲁山县的党政领导机关鉴于二年多来婚姻自由基本上实现，模范干部、模范夫妻和模范家庭日渐增多，为了树立旗帜，指出贯彻婚姻法的方向，特于一九五二年十月二十五日召开全县“贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会”。参加大会的模范代表都是经过各乡群众评选出来的。各乡在评选前都做了婚姻法的宣传工作。参加会议的有模范夫妻九十九对，模范家庭十一户，模范干部十九人，每乡并各有一名至二名未婚青年的代表，总计参加会议的代表共四百一十人。代表们在会上相互介绍了经验，报告了自己的模范事迹，最后经过大家讨论，评选出模范夫妻二十二对，模范家庭三户，模范干部二个，模范乡二个，在全县树立了贯彻婚姻法的旗帜。在模范家庭中，有的是多年不和的旧家庭现在变好了，有的是一个不和睦的家庭在离婚后变成了两个和睦的家庭。这些旗帜的树立，用活的事实教育了群众，使广大群众更加全心全意拥护婚姻法，并给进一步贯彻婚姻法创造了有利的条件。
    鲁山县在贯彻执行婚姻法中所以能做这样多的工作，得到较好的成绩，中共鲁山县委对婚姻法的重视是有决定意义的。该县县委曾教育全体干部与全体党员和全体青年团员，要在贯彻与执行婚姻法中起带头作用与骨干作用。党、团员思想不通的，先在内部打通思想，消除顾虑，树立起对婚姻法的正确看法和态度。这就保证了党、团员实际行动中的一致性、积极性和责任心。县妇联和县人民法院在贯彻婚姻法工作中，也积极支持群众的正义斗争，县人民法院做到及时处理婚姻案件。没有这些，上述成绩是不可能得到的。
