    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Gained Greatly from Studying the Second Part of Malenkov's Report; Overcame the Shortcomings of Neglecting Production Plans in the Past

    Cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, in studying the second part of Malenkov's report, implemented the spirit of integrating theory with practice, which advanced the plant's production work.

    The plant's study of the second part of Malenkov's report began on December 11th of last year. In order to closely integrate the study with their own work, the plant decided to focus on studying the two sections "Industry" and "Practicing Strict Economy is a Very Important Means to Further Improve the National Economy." When the plant's core group studied, each comrade first read the document and deeply understood its spirit; then, in coordination with their own work, they collected some materials, identified problems existing in various aspects of the plant, and analyzed and discussed them.

    In connection with Malenkov's report, the core group discussed the issue of production plans. The unevenness of the plant's production volume has always been a relatively serious problem. Taking the situation of pig iron production in 1952 as an example, according to the monthly production plans, only three months from January to October were completed. The unfulfilled parts were all piled up in the last two months to catch up, forming a phenomenon of being loose in the beginning and tight in the end, resulting in a large increase in defective products. Therefore, the plant director, Comrade Zhou Jiahua, said in the discussion: "The production situation of our plant: we don't care in the first half of the year, we still don't pay attention in the third quarter, and we only step on the gas in the fourth quarter, which has become a 'rule.' This shows the severity of everyone's neglect of production plans. Next year (1953), we must act according to the plan from January."

    At the meeting, everyone examined the past mistakes of insufficient understanding of "the plan is the law of the state." Comrade Cui Yingguo, the secretary of the Party committee, said: "In the past, many comrades only generally believed that completing the task was very glorious, and failing to complete it was just not very good. They did not understand that failing to complete the plan is equivalent to not complying with the laws of the country, and even less did they understand the harm of a production unit failing to complete the plan to national construction. For example, if our ironmaking task cannot be completed, it will affect the failure of the steelmaking task, and it will also affect the failure of the machine manufacturing task. If our quality does not meet the standards stipulated in the plan, it will shorten the life of the machine. If steel is needed to manufacture weapons, it will affect the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea." In the past, due to insufficient understanding of the concept that the national plan is the law, many comrades did not pay attention to the plan. For example, when compiling the 1953 plan, the workshops' plans were all submitted, but the responsible cadres of some workshops' Party and government still did not know, as if the plan was a matter for a few staff members. Especially when formulating the plan, everyone had no idea in their minds, the preliminary investigation and research work was very poor, the past experience in production was not well summarized, and there was no precise calculation of how much production could be increased by a certain technical improvement, so the advanced and realistic nature of the plan could not be grasped well. At the same time, the plan did not become a truly mass plan. In the past, the plan was first drafted by the planning section according to the requirements of the higher authorities, although it was casually sent down for general discussion, no one raised positive opinions. When implementing the plan, the leadership was very concerned about the numbers, and the workers did not understand how much the plan was and how much was actually produced, but only blindly produced. The responsible comrades of the ministry did not summarize and analyze the amount of output, and sometimes even if they summarized, they did not convey it to the workers, so of course it could not play a guiding role in production. The plan was not grasped by the masses, and many plans were very conservative, so the plan lacked positive significance.

    During the discussion period, in order to promptly improve the shortcomings of leading cadres in having no idea about the plan, the deputy head of the planning section used the study time to give an oral report to the core group on the implementation of the work plan and the situation of the 1953 plan, and also put forward some suggestions for improvement.

    The gains from the core group's study played a demonstrative role in the study of all cadres. When the core group discussed, the responsible cadres of the key workshops attended, and on December 27th of last year, an enlarged cadre meeting of the whole plant was held, and the secretary of the Party committee reported the learning situation and gains of the core group to everyone, which further encouraged everyone's learning enthusiasm. For example, the repair department, in connection with the many problems in the upcoming overhaul of a blast furnace, checked and proposed active improvement methods. The last time the department overhauled a blast furnace, due to poor labor organization and unclear division of labor, the foreman was in charge of the overall work (such as forging and welding workers were completely controlled by the forging and welding foreman), which formed a phenomenon that the foreman turned around everywhere and the workers looked for the foreman everywhere, resulting in a great waste of manpower and time. Through study, it was decided that in this overhaul, the project would be divided into several work sections, each section would be led by the section chief and technicians (each section including forging and welding workers, riveters, crane workers, etc.), so that problems could be solved in a timely manner. In order to correct the inaccuracy in making plans in the past, this time they made a "defect list," widely solicited the opinions of users, and organized an inspection team to conduct on-site investigations, and finally made a comprehensive plan.

    The responsible cadres of the coking department, in studying, examined the past erroneous idea of only valuing the quantity of coke but not the quality. Comrade Duan Chunxian, the secretary of the general branch of the coking department, said: "In the past, we only pursued more coke production, so that we could complete the production task, but we did not pay attention to the quality of coke. Ideologically, we always thought that the ironmaking department was holding us back by requiring quality. In fact, we did not consider from a comprehensive perspective how much the poor quality of coke would affect the ironmaking, which is also a manifestation of insufficient understanding of how to complete the overall plan."

    The foundry department also solved some important problems in production in connection with the study. They first contacted the problem of defective pipe fittings and steel ingot molds. This problem has existed for a long time, but the real reason has not been found for a long time. Some people said it was a problem with the molten iron; some people said it was an operation problem, and the leadership did not understand it in depth. It was not until the scrap rate developed very seriously in December that they launched a discussion in connection with Malenkov's report. As a result, it was found that the current amount of coke in the molten iron was too much, and the limestone was insufficient, so that some impurities could not be removed, resulting in defective products. After discussion, the limestone and coke were proportionally allocated, so that the problem of defective pipe fittings was initially solved. Originally, from December 1st to December 21st, 1952, a total of 154 defective products to be repaired were produced, but from December 22nd to December 27th after the improvement, only one defective product was produced.

    In short, this time, studying the second part of Malenkov's report improved the ideology and work of the cadres by selecting key points and linking them with the reality of their own work.

    石景山钢铁厂学习马林科夫报告第二部分收获很大
    克服了过去不重视生产计划的缺点
    石景山钢铁厂干部学习马林科夫报告第二部分时，贯彻了理论联系实际的精神，使该厂生产工作提高了一步。
    该厂关于马林科夫报告第二部分的学习，是从去年十二月十一日开始的。为了使学习密切配合本身工作，该厂决定以学习“工业”及“实行严格的节约，这是进一步提高国民经济的一个极重要手段”两小节为重点。该厂核心组学习时，每个同志首先阅读文件，深入领会文件精神；然后配合本身业务搜集一些资料，找出厂内各方面存在的问题，加以分析讨论。
    联系马林科夫的报告，核心组讨论了生产计划问题。该厂生产量不均匀的情况向来都是比较严重的。以一九五二年的生铁产量状况来看，根据每月生产计划，一月份至十月份只有三个月是完成了的，未完成的部分都堆到最后两个月来赶，形成前松后紧废品大量增加的现象。因此，厂长周家华同志在讨论中说：“我们厂子的生产情况：上半年总是不在乎，第三季还不注意，到第四季才加油，这已成了‘规律’。这说明大家对生产计划不重视的程度是严重的，明年（一九五三年）从一月份起就要按计划办事。”
    会上大家都检查了过去对“计划就是国家法律”的认识不足的错误。党委书记崔映国同志说：“过去有不少同志只笼统地认为完成任务很光荣，完不成只是不大好看就完了。不了解完不成计划就等于不遵守国家的法律，更不了解一个生产单位完不成计划对国家建设的危害性。如我们炼铁任务不能完成，就会影响到炼钢任务的完不成，也会影响到机器制造任务的完不成。如我们的质量不符合计划规定的标准，就会缩短机器的寿命。如果需要用钢来制造武器，就要影响抗美援朝工作。”过去由于对国家计划就是法律的观念认识不足，因此许多同志对计划都不重视。如编制一九五三年计划时，车间的计划都报上来了，但有的车间党、政负责干部还不知道，好像计划是少数工作人员的事情。特别在制订计划时大家心中无数，事先的调查研究工作很差，以往生产上的经验也没有很好总结，对某项技术改进能提高多少生产也没有精细的计算，因而对计划的先进性与现实性就掌握不好。同时计划也没有成为真正群众性的计划。过去编制计划，都是先由计划课根据上级要求草拟出一个数字，虽然也随便发下去泛泛讨论一下，谁也不提出积极的意见。在执行计划时，领导上对数字的关心很差，工人更不了解计划是多少，实际生产了多少，只是盲目地生产着。部里负责同志对产量多少也不加以总结和分析，有时就是总结了也没传达给工人，当然就不能起指导生产的作用。计划没有被群众所掌握，并且很多计划带着很大的保守性，因此计划缺乏积极的意义。
    在讨论期间，为了及时改进领导干部在计划方面心中无数的缺点，计划课副课长利用学习时间把工作计划的执行情况和一九五三年计划情形向核心组作了口头报告，同时提出了些改进意见。
    核心组的学习收获对全体干部的学习起了示范作用。在核心组讨论时，各重点车间的党政负责干部都列席参加，去年十二月二十七日并召开了全厂扩大干部会，由党委书记把核心组的学习情况与收获向大家作了报告，这样更鼓舞了大家的学习情绪。如修理部在学习中联系到即将开始的某高炉大修中的许多问题加以检查，提出了积极改进的方法。该部上次大修某高炉时，由于劳动组织不好，分工不明确，由工长掌握全盘工作（如锻焊工完全由锻焊工长掌握），这样形成工长到处转，工友到处找工长的现象，人力和时间的浪费很大。通过学习，决定在这次大修时把工程分成若干工作段，每段由段长和技术人员统一领导（每段包括锻焊工、铆工、起重工等），这样就能及时解决问题。为了纠正过去在作计划上的不准确，这次他们作了一个“缺陷表”，广泛征求使用人员的意见，并组织了检查组到现场进行调查，最后再作全盘计划。
    炼焦部的负责干部在学习中检查了过去对焦炭只重量不重质的错误思想，炼焦部总支书记段春贤同志说：“过去只追求焦炭出得多，这样可以完成了生产任务，但是对焦炭的质量不重视，思想上总认为要求质量是炼铁部卡我们，实际上没有从全面考虑焦炭质量不好对炼铁的影响有多大，这也是对如何完成全面的计划认识不足的表现”。
    铸造部结合学习也解决了生产上一些重要问题。他们首先联系到管件和钢锭模的废品问题，这个问题存在很久，但长期找不出真正的原因。有人说是铁水问题；有人说是操作问题，领导上也没有深入了解，直到十二月份废品率发展得很严重了，才联系马林科夫的报告展开讨论。结果发现现在的铁水焦炭量太多，石灰石不足，致使一部分杂物不能去掉，因而造成废品。经过讨论后即将石灰石与焦炭按比例调配，使管件废品问题初步得到解决。原来自一九五二年十二月一日至二十一日共出废品待修品一百五十四件，可是从十二月二十二日改进后至十二月二十七日只出废品一件。
    总之，这次学习马林科夫报告第二部分由于选择了重点，联系了自己工作的实际，使干部的思想与工作都提高了一步。
