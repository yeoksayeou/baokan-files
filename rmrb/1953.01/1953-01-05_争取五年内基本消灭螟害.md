Editor's Note: Rice stem borers cause great damage to rice production in our country. It is estimated that in years with severe borer damage, the loss of rice is often over ten billion jin. In order to eliminate rice stem borers, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a national symposium on borer control in Hangzhou in June 1952, focusing on discussing the direction and specific methods of borer control work in the future, and clearly put forward the task of striving to basically eliminate rice stem borers within five years. This is of great significance to future borer control work. Borer damage has existed in our country for thousands of years and has always been considered a most difficult pest to control. This symposium on borer control, based on the life cycle of rice stem borers, proposed effective control methods with winter control as the main focus. This not only provides possible conditions for basically eliminating rice stem borers within the next five years, but also points the direction for eliminating other pests.

Strive to Basically Eliminate Rice Stem Borer Within Five Years

The State of Rice Stem Borer Damage Nationwide

The rice stem borers that harm rice are the striped rice borer, the yellow rice borer, and the white rice borer, which coexist in the three major regions of East China, Central South China, and Southwest China. In coastal, riverside, and plain areas, the striped rice borer is generally the most common. In mountainous and hilly areas and humid areas, such as Hunan and southern Sichuan, the yellow rice borer is the main species. The white rice borer is scattered in rice-growing provinces and regions, but the number is very small and does not cause disasters to rice. Generally, severe borer disasters are caused by the striped rice borer. In individual areas, such as Hunan Province, the damage from the yellow rice borer is also very serious.

Therefore, the striped rice borer is the most important pest of the three types of rice stem borers in rice-growing areas, and also the main target of borer control work in rice-growing areas.

Rice stem borers have strong reproductive capacity and a wide distribution range, causing extremely serious damage to rice. 1949 was a year of exceptionally severe borer disaster. Southern Jiangsu lost about one billion jin of rice, and Zhejiang lost about two billion jin of rice. 1951 was a year with relatively light borer damage, and various places launched borer control campaigns, reducing the loss from borer damage. However, according to incomplete estimates from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and the two regions of southern and western Sichuan, rice losses still reached over 2.5 billion jin. Based on existing historical materials and the losses in the three years since liberation, it is estimated that in years with severe damage in borer-affected areas, rice losses are over ten billion jin.

Basic Experiences in Controlling Rice Stem Borers in the Past Two Years

After liberation, various provinces and regions successively mobilized and organized the broad masses of peasants to launch large-scale borer control campaigns. According to existing materials, Jiangxi's Three Plowing Movement (active autumn plowing, universal winter plowing, and early spring plowing) combined with the Three Emptying Movement (mobilizing women and children to pull out all the rice roots, pick them all up, and burn them all) in purple clover fields has had the greatest effect. In 1950, 90% of the rice fields in Jiangxi Province were winter-plowed, and in 1951, it reached 92%. Due to the widespread and in-depth movement, borer damage in 1951 was greatly reduced. According to the current situation, it is estimated that Jiangxi has been able to control rice stem borers.

The main experiences gained from borer control in various places in the past two years are as follows:

(1) There must be correct leadership and a firm determination. The experience of provinces and regions in carrying out borer control movements proves that the key to whether the movement can be launched according to the planned schedule lies in whether leaders at all levels attach importance to it and can do it themselves. Only with the firm determination of leading cadres can the paralysis and fear of difficulties among cadres be broken. Therefore, agricultural and forestry administrative departments and pest and disease prevention and control institutions must frequently and repeatedly reflect the relevant information and data on rice stem borers, as well as specific control plans, to higher levels in a timely manner to obtain the attention and support of the leadership.

(2) Fully mobilize and organize the masses to form a mass movement. Borer control work is carried out in large areas of rice fields. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the broad masses of peasants to participate in the movement, requiring every household to know about it, everyone to take action, and every household to control borers. This is the primary step in carrying out a mass borer control movement. Any coercive measures will be counterproductive. In the process of the movement, it is necessary to establish a certain organizational leadership, such as a special committee or command headquarters.

(3) Apply correct and effective control methods and implement technical guidance. Correct technical guidance and control methods are important conditions for the smooth development and improvement of the borer control movement. In the past two years, methods such as egg collection, moth trapping, and lamp trapping adopted in many areas belong to temporary rescue measures and have a certain effect. But according to today's requirements, it must be improved one step further. Facts have proved that some areas (such as Jiangxi and some counties and districts in Zhejiang) have achieved significant results with winter control as the main focus. This is the main way to quickly eliminate borer disasters in the future.

Strive to Eliminate Borer Disasters Within Five Years

In order to adapt to the task of increasing grain production and meet the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants to eliminate borer disasters, the National Symposium on Borer Control has put forward the task of eliminating borer disasters within five years as the goal for rice-growing provinces and regions.

The striped rice borer is a pest with strong reproductive capacity, extremely wide distribution, and difficult control. However, it has a fatal weakness: it does not harm any other plants other than rice. More than 95% of its last generation of larvae overwinter in rice roots from November to late March of the following year, with a hibernation period of up to 150 to 200 days. The few striped rice borers overwintering in rice straw all die due to intolerance to dryness. Because the striped rice borer has the above-mentioned characteristics of single feeding habit, overwintering in rice roots, long hibernation time, and no migration, winter is the most effective time to eliminate the striped rice borer, and winter plowing to destroy rice roots is the most effective method to eliminate the striped rice borer. Winter is the slack farming season, and peasants have plenty of time to work, and men, women, old and young can participate. Some areas already have the habit of winter plowing, which is not only conducive to borer control, but also can eliminate other pests, promote soil weathering, and increase fertility, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. There are many ways to destroy rice roots. In addition to winter plowing, they can be dug up and destroyed, or pulled out, or combined with winter plowing to irrigate, all of which are simple, effective, and easily accepted by the masses.

According to the characteristics of rice stem borers, the National Symposium on Borer Control believes that as long as the winter rice root destruction campaign can be resolutely promoted, the overwintering rice stem borers can be killed, and effectively auxiliary methods are used to implement the central government's spirit of "prevention is more important than treatment", it is entirely possible to eliminate borer damage. There are the following methods to eliminate borer damage. First, basic methods - carry out methods during the rice stem borer overwintering period: A. The method of combining Three Plowing with Three Emptying - In areas where the soil in rice fields is loose and easy to harrow, the method of combining Three Plowing with Three Emptying, which has been effective in Jiangxi Province, can be adopted: that is, actively autumn plow early rice fields to expand autumn planting, which can both control rice stem borers and increase production; winter plowing combined with harrowing to turn most of the rice roots into the soil to kill overwintering borers; rice fields that have not been winter-plowed must be early spring-plowed before the vernal equinox or Qingming Festival, before the rice stem borers have emerged as moths, to turn the rice roots into the soil. After plowing and harrowing, all the rice roots left on the surface of the soil, as well as the rice roots in the purple clover fields, should be mobilized by the masses to dig up, pick up, and burn (or use other methods to treat the rice roots instead of burning).

B. Digging up and destroying rice roots - In areas with serious rice stem borer damage and sticky soil that is not easy to harrow, rice roots must be dug up and destroyed regardless of whether the rice fields are winter-plowed and winter-planted.

C. Treatment of green manure fields - Green manure fields in general areas should be turned over before the Qingming Festival of the following year, and combined with irrigation to kill overwintering larvae. However, seed retention fields are turned over later and are a hiding place for rice stem borers. The rice roots must be dug up and destroyed at the end of the year of sowing, before the grass seeds have grown up.

D. Long-term waterlogging - Rice fields with convenient water sources can be waterlogged for a long time. If they can be waterlogged for a long time after winter plowing, the effect of killing rice stem borers will be greater.

Second, auxiliary methods - carried out when rice stem borer moths are in full bloom before rice heading

A. Collect eggs and capture moths, and protect parasitic wasps.

B. Trap moths with lamps.

C. In areas with tobacco stem supply, apply tobacco stems or spray tobacco lime powder, and advocate planting tobacco in farmers' spare land for self-cultivation and self-use.

Third, methods carried out in individual areas

In Guangdong and other places, striped rice borers are concentrated in seedbeds to lay eggs. In Fujian, northern Jiangsu, Hunan, and other places, yellow rice borers are seriously harmful. Egg collection and moth trapping and lamp trapping methods can be used in seedbeds. In order to control the yellow rice borer, it is necessary to combine the removal of weeds on the edges of the fields, early removal of dead heart seedlings, and treatment of late rice straw.

    编者按：螟虫对我国水稻生产为害极大。据估计：在螟害严重的年份，损失稻谷常在一百亿斤以上。为了消灭螟害，一九五二年六月间，中央人民政府农业部在杭州召开了全国治螟座谈会，着重讨论了今后治螟工作的方向和具体办法，明确地提出了争取在五年内基本消灭螟害的任务。这对今后治螟工作有极重要的意义。螟害在我国已经有数千年的历史，一向被认为是一种最难防治的虫害。这次治螟座谈会根据螟虫生活规律，提出以冬季治螟为主的有效防治方法，这不仅给今后五年内基本消灭螟害提供了可能的条件，也给消灭其他虫害指出了方向。
    争取五年内基本消灭螟害
    全国螟虫为害情况
    为害水稻的螟虫有三化螟、二化螟与大螟三种，在华东、中南、西南三大区域内同时并存。在沿海、沿江与平原地带，一般以三化螟占多数。在山岳丘陵地带和卑湿地区，如湖南、川南等地，则以二化螟为主。大螟散布于水稻区域各省区，但为数甚少，对水稻不致造成灾害。一般地区的严重螟灾，都由三化螟所造成，个别地区，如湖南省，二化螟为害也很严重。
    因此，三化螟是水稻区域的三种螟虫中最主要的害虫，亦为水稻区域治螟工作的主要对象。
    螟虫繁殖力强，分布范围广泛，对水稻造成的灾害异常严重。一九四九年是螟灾异常严重的一年，苏南约损失十亿斤稻谷，浙江约损失二十亿斤稻谷。一九五一年是螟害较轻的一年，各地又展开了治螟运动，减轻了螟害的损失；但据江苏、浙江、江西、广东、湖南、湖北六省和四川的川南、川西两个地区的不完全的估计，稻谷损失仍达二十五亿斤以上。据现有的历史材料与解放以后三年来的损失情况推测，在螟害分布区域，被害严重的年份，损失稻谷当在一百亿斤以上。
    两年来防治螟虫的基本经验
    解放后，各省区先后发动与组织广大农民，展开了规模巨大的治螟运动。根据现有材料看来，以江西的三耕运动（积极秋耕、普遍冬耕、提早春耕）结合紫云英田的三光运动（发动妇女儿童将稻根拔光、拣光、烧光）的成效最大。一九五○年江西省冬耕的稻田达百分之九十，一九五一年达百分之九十二。由于运动普遍深入，使一九五一年的螟害大为减轻。据目前的情况估计，江西已能控制螟虫。
    两年来各地治螟获得的主要经验有以下几点：
    （1）必须有正确的领导，坚强的决心。各省、区开展治螟运动的经验证明：运动能否按照预定计划发动起来，关键在于各级领导是否重视，能否亲自动手。只有领导干部的决心坚强，才能打破干部中的麻痹思想与畏难情绪。因此，农林行政部门与病虫害防治机构，要经常地反复不断地将有关螟害的情况与资料，以及具体的防治方案，及时反映给上级，取得领导方面的重视和支持。
    （2）充分发动和组织群众，形成群众性的运动。治螟工作是在大片面积的水稻区域进行的，因此，必须发动和组织广大农民投入运动，要求家喻户晓，人人动手，户户治螟，这是开展群众性治螟运动的首要步骤，任何强迫命令的做法都将事与愿违。在运动过程中，要建立一定的组织领导，如专门委员会或指挥部等。
    （3）运用正确而有效的防治方法，贯彻技术指导。正确的技术指导和防治方法，是使治螟运动顺利发展和提高的重要条件。两年来，许多地区所采用的采卵捕蛾、点灯诱蛾等方法，属于临时抢救性质，有其一定的效果。但根据今天的要求，必须提高一步。事实证明，有些地区（如江西及浙江部分县区）以冬季治螟为主，表现了显著的成效，这是今后迅速消灭螟灾的主要途径。
    争取五年之内消灭螟灾
    为了适应增产粮食的任务，满足广大农民消灭螟灾的迫切要求，全国治螟座谈会特提出五年内消灭螟灾的任务，作为水稻区域各省区的奋斗目标。
    三化螟是繁殖力强，分布极广，防治较难的害虫，但它有致命的弱点：除了能危害水稻以外，不危害其他任何植物，其末一代幼虫的百分之九十五以上，自十一月起至翌年三月下旬，在稻根内过冬，冬眠时间长达一百五十至二百天之久。在稻草里过冬的少数三化螟虫，则因不耐干燥全部死亡。由于三化螟具有上述的单食性、在稻根里过冬、冬眠时间长、不迁移等特性，因此，冬季是消灭三化螟最有效的时机，而冬耕毁灭稻根，则是消灭三化螟的最有效的方法。冬季为农闲季节，农民有充分时间进行工作，男女老少皆可参加。部分地区原有冬耕习惯，不仅有利于治螟，且能消除其他害虫，促进土壤风化，增加肥力，一举数得。毁灭稻根的方法很多，除冬耕之外，可掘毁和拔毁，或结合冬耕进行灌水，都简便有效，易为群众所接受。
    根据螟虫的特性，全国治螟座谈会认为只要能够坚决推行冬季毁灭稻根运动，杀死过冬螟虫，并配合切实有效的辅助方法，贯彻中央“防重于治”的精神，消灭螟害是完全可能的。消灭螟害有以下几项办法。一、基本方法——在螟虫过冬期进行甲、三耕结合三光的办法——在稻田土质疏松容易耙碎的地区，可采用在江西省已行之有效的三耕结合三光的办法：即早稻田积极秋耕，扩大秋种，既可治螟，又可增加生产；冬耕结合耙地，把大部分稻根翻入土中，杀死过冬螟虫；未冬耕的稻田，必须于次年春分或清明前螟虫还没有化蛾飞出时，提早春耕，把稻根翻下土去。耕耙以后，所有留在土面的稻根，以及紫云英田中的稻根，都发动群众掘光、拣光和烧光（或用其他办法处理稻根，代替烧光）。
    乙、掘毁稻根——在螟害严重，黏土不易耙碎地区，稻田无论冬耕冬种与否，必须一律掘毁稻根。
    丙、处理绿肥田——一般地区的绿肥田，均应于次年清明前翻土，并结合灌水，以杀灭过冬幼虫。但留种田翻土较迟，为螟虫潜伏场所，必须在播种当年年底，草子未长大前，即把稻根掘毁。
    丁、长期浸水——水源便利的稻田可长期浸水，如能在冬耕后长期浸水，杀螟的效力更大。
    二、辅助方法——在水稻抽穗前螟蛾盛发时进行
    甲、采卵捕蛾，并保护寄生蜂。
    乙、点灯诱蛾。
    丙、有烟茎供应地区，施行插烟茎或喷撒烟草石灰粉，并提倡在农家隙地种植烟草，自种自用。
    三、个别地区进行的办法
    广东等地三化螟虫集中在秧田产卵，福建、苏北、湖南等地二化螟为害严重，可采用秧田采卵捕蛾和点灯诱蛾等方法。为了防治二化螟，必须结合铲除田边杂草，早拔枯心苗，及处理晚稻稻草等方法。
