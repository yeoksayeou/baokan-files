    The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital Restored My Health

    Editor: I am a worker at the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine. In March 1951, while working underground, I accidentally broke my right arm. After treatment at the mine's hospital, I finally overcame the dangerous period. However, because my right arm was severely injured, I suffered nerve paralysis and lost sensation. The administrative department transferred me to the orthopedic department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital for treatment. After surgery and physical therapy, my right hand regained sensation. I happily returned to the mining area from Beijing to recuperate. But not long after, the affected area became locally red, swollen, and festering, and it did not heal for a long time. The administrative department then consulted with the Ministry of Public Health and introduced me to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After careful research and treatment by Comrade Vaskresensky, the director of the hospital's surgery department, and Comrade Dumansky, a surgical expert, my wound healed quickly. Now, I am no longer disabled, but a healthy person. After a period of recuperation, I will be able to continue working.

    北京苏联红十字医院恢复了我的健康
    编辑同志：我是国营峰峰煤矿的工人。一九五一年三月在坑下工作时，不慎将右臂摔坏，经矿务局医院治疗后终于脱离了危险期。但右臂因受伤过重，神经麻痹，失去了知觉。行政方面将我转送到北京协和医院骨科治疗，经手术和物理疗法后，我的右手恢复了知觉。我便愉快地从北京回到了矿区休养。但没有多久，患处发生局部红肿、化脓的现象，久治不愈。行政方面就商请中央卫生部把我介绍到北京苏联红十字医院治疗。经该院外科主任瓦斯克列辛斯基同志和外科专家杜曼斯基同志的精心研究和治疗，我的伤口很快地愈合了。现在，我已经不是一个残废者，而是一个健康的人了。再经过一段时间的休养，我便能继续参加工作。
