Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: The Central People's Government Committee held its 20th and 21st meetings on January 13th and 14th, respectively. The attendance was 42 people at the 20th meeting and 41 people at the 21st meeting.

    The topic of the 20th meeting was the preparation and convening of the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels. Premier Zhou Enlai gave a detailed explanation at the meeting on the issue of convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels. In his explanation, Premier Zhou pointed out that on the basis of a series of great victories achieved by the Chinese people over the past three years, and at a time when the country is beginning to enter the planned, large-scale first five-year construction plan, it is not only necessary but also has sufficient conditions to convene the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels, as stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Regarding this issue, the Communist Party of China had already made a proposal to the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on December 24, 1952, and it was unanimously agreed upon by all democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic individuals. It is hereby requested that the Central People's Government Committee, in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, pass a resolution to convene, in 1953, People's Congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels, elected by the people through universal suffrage, and on this basis, to convene the National People's Congress to formulate a constitution, approve the outline of the national five-year construction plan, and elect a new Central People's Government.

    During the discussion of this topic, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Committee Member Zhang Bojun, Committee Member Huang Yanpei, Committee Member Zhang Zhizhong, Committee Member Fu Zuoyi, Committee Member Chen Shutong, Committee Member Ma Xulun, Committee Member Peng Zemin, Committee Member Ulanhu, Committee Member Chen Jiageng, Committee Member Li Zhangda, and Committee Member He Xiangning successively spoke, unanimously endorsing Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to convene the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels. Vice Chairman Li Jishen said that this proposal is very timely and realistic. The convening of the People's Congress can give greater play to the people's democratic system, and can coordinate with the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and various national construction projects, so that various tasks can be done better and greater achievements can be made. Committee Member Zhang Bojun said that the conditions for convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels and formulating a constitution in 1953 are indeed in place, and it is a practical need. All democratic parties and the people of the whole country should strive to complete this major task. Committee Member Huang Yanpei said that now that the various conditions stipulated in the Common Program have been met, convening the People's Congress is not only appropriate but also possible. This is a very good education for the broad masses of people and staff, and can make everyone more clearly aware of the position of the people as masters and the direction of our country's development. Doing this work well can make the relationship between the people and the government, the people's democratic dictatorship, and the foundation of the new China more consolidated. Committee Member Zhang Zhizhong said that he has personally seen the great victories and achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects in the past three years, and has seen the unprecedented increase in the people's awareness. In these three years, the people have been satisfied with the People's Representatives Conferences at all levels, and today, before the people have made further demands, the Communist Party of China and the People's Government have proposed convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels, which precisely demonstrates the wisdom and correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Doing so can make the people of the whole country more united around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and work together for national construction. Committee Member Fu Zuoyi said that the proposal of the Communist Party of China itself demonstrates the greatness of the Chinese people's power and the consolidation of unity. He then cited the example of residents and even boatmen in many remote areas he saw during his inspection of national water conservancy work, illustrating that the political awareness of the people of the whole country has indeed made astonishing progress, and convening the People's Congress at this time is entirely in line with the needs of the people. Committee Member Chen Shutong said that convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels is timely and correct. To this end, we should immediately begin and do a good job of various preparatory work. Committee Member Ma Xulun said that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have been mobilized and organized in the three years since taking control of the country, and the people's awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Therefore, the conditions for convening the National People's Congress are already in place. Taking this correct measure in a timely manner can further demonstrate the superiority of our country's people's democratic system. Committee Member Peng Zemin said that convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels in 1953 is most appropriate, and he firmly believes that relying on the leadership of Chairman Mao and everyone's joint efforts, we will certainly be able to complete this great task victoriously, just like in the past three years. Committee Member Ulanhu said that the convening of the National People's Congress will be wholeheartedly supported by ethnic minorities. The people of ethnic minorities participating in this universal suffrage will feel the warmth of the big family even more. The unity between the various nationalities will be even closer. In his speech, Committee Member Chen Jiageng compared the era of reactionary rule in our country with the era of people's democracy based on his life experience. He said that he personally felt that the motherland was great and bright under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The proposal of the Communist Party of China will not only be satisfied by domestic compatriots, but will also be enthusiastically supported by overseas Chinese. Committee Member Li Zhangda said that since the broad masses of the people have changed from being unorganized to organized, convening the National People's Congress has good conditions. This will be another great victory for the Chinese people. It is not only a joyful event for the people of the whole country, but also for the people of the world. Committee Member He Xiangning said that the many great victories in our country in the past three years are infinitely inspiring, and the convening of the National People's Congress will make the people of the whole country more sincerely love Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the People's Government.

    In concluding the discussion, Chairman Mao Zedong made a brief conclusion. Chairman Mao said that, nationwide, military operations on the mainland have ended, land reform has been basically completed, and people from all walks of life have been organized. Therefore, according to the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the conditions for convening the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels are ripe. This is a great victory achieved by the Chinese people after decades of bloodshed and sacrifice in the struggle for democracy. Convening the People's Congress can further promote people's democracy, strengthen national construction, and strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The government of the People's Congress system will still be a government of the united front of all nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country, and it is beneficial to the people of the whole country.

    After Chairman Mao's speech, the Central People's Government Committee unanimously passed the "Resolution on Convening the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels."

    The 21st meeting, after hearing the explanation by Kong Yuan, Director of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government, passed a resolution approving the "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Approving the Merger of Customs and Foreign Trade Administration Organs," and then passed and approved various appointment and removal cases.

    中央人民政府委员会开会
    通过关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府委员会在一月十三、十四两日先后举行第二十次、第二十一次会议。出席人数：第二十次会议为四十二人，第二十一次会议为四十一人。
    第二十次会议的议题是筹备并召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会问题。周恩来总理在会上对召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会问题作了详尽的说明。周总理在说明中指出，在三年来中国人民所取得的一系列的伟大胜利的基础之上，在全国开始进入有计划的、大规模的国家第一个五年建设之时，及时地召开人民政协共同纲领所规定的全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会，不仅有必要，而且也有了充分的条件。关于这个问题，中国共产党已在一九五二年十二月二十四日向人民政协全国委员会常务委员会提出建议，并经各民主党派、各人民团体和无党派民主人士一致同意。兹特提请中央人民政府委员会依照中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法的规定通过决议，在一九五三年召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会，以制定宪法，批准国家五年建设计划纲要和选举新的中央人民政府。
    在讨论这一议题时，李济深副主席、章伯钧委员、黄炎培委员、张治中委员、傅作义委员、陈叔通委员、马叙伦委员、彭泽民委员、乌兰夫委员、陈嘉庚委员、李章达委员、何香凝委员相继发言，一致赞同周恩来总理所提出的关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的提议。李济深副主席说，这一提议很适时，很实事求是。人民代表大会的召开，可以使人民民主制度发挥更大力量，可以配合抗美援朝斗争和国家的各项建设，使各种工作作的更好，作出更大成绩。章伯钧委员说，在一九五三年召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会并制定宪法的条件确已具备，且是实际上所需要。各民主党派和全国人民都应当为完成这一件大事而努力。黄炎培委员说，在共同纲领所规定的各项条件已经具备的今天，召开人民代表大会不仅是应该的，而且是可能的。这对于广大人民和工作人员来说是很好的教育，可使大家更清楚地认识到人民所处的主人翁地位和我们国家发展的方向。做好这件工作，可使人民与政府的关系、人民民主专政和新中国的立国基础更加巩固。张治中委员说，自己亲眼看到三年来中国人民在各方面取得了伟大的胜利和成绩，看到了人民觉悟有了空前提高。在这三年内，人民对各界人民代表会议是满意的，而今天，在人民还未提出进一步的要求之前，中国共产党和人民政府即提议召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会，正说明中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明和正确。这样做，可以使全国人民更加团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为国家建设而共同努力。傅作义委员说，中国共产党的提议本身，就表现了中国人民力量的伟大和团结的巩固。他接着举出他在巡视全国水利工作时所见到的许多穷乡僻壤的居民以至船户为例，说明全国人民的政治觉悟确已有了惊人的进步，在这时召开人民代表大会是完全符合人民需要的。陈叔通委员说，召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会之举是适时的，正确的。为此，应即开始作并作好各项准备工作。马叙伦委员说，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在掌握国家之后，这三年间，已经发动和组织起来，人民的觉悟已有空前提高。因此，召开全国人民代表大会的条件已经具备。及时采取这一正确的措施，可以更加发挥我国人民民主制度的优越性。彭泽民委员说，一九五三年召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会之举是最适当的，深信依靠毛主席的领导和大家的共同努力，我们一定能像过去三年一样，胜利地完成这一伟大任务。乌兰夫委员说，全国人民代表大会的召开，将得到少数民族的衷心拥护。少数民族的人民参加这次普选，将会更感到大家庭的温暖。各民族之间的团结，将会更加紧密。陈嘉庚委员在发言中以自己一生的经历比较了我国的反动统治时代和人民民主时代，他说，他亲身感受到祖国在毛主席的领导下是伟大的，光明的。中国共产党的提议不仅会受到国内同胞的满意，而且一定会得到海外华侨的热烈拥护。李章达委员说，由于广大人民已由无组织变为有组织，召开全国人民代表大会已具备了良好的条件。这将是中国人民的又一伟大胜利。它不仅是全国人民，也是全世界人民所欢欣鼓舞的事。何香凝委员说，我国三年来的许多伟大胜利是令人无限感奋的，而全国人民代表大会的召开，将使全国人民更加衷心热爱毛泽东主席、中国共产党和人民政府。
    在结束讨论时，毛泽东主席作了简短的结论。毛主席说，就全国范围来说，大陆上的军事行动已经结束，土地改革已经基本完成，各界人民已经组织起来，因此，根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的规定，召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的条件已经成熟了，这是中国人民流血牺牲，为民主奋斗历数十年之久才得到的伟大胜利。召开人民代表大会，可以更加发扬人民民主，加强国家建设和加强抗美援朝的斗争。人民代表大会制的政府，仍将是全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派和各人民团体统一战线的政府，它是对全国人民都有利的。
    在毛主席讲话后，中央人民政府委员会一致通过了“关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议”。
    第二十一次会议在听取了中央人民政府海关总署孔原署长的说明后通过决议，批准“中央人民政府政务院关于批准海关与对外贸易管理机关实行合并的决定”，并接着通过和批准了各项任免案。
