	At the Evening Session of the World People's Peace Congress on December 13
	Speech by Soviet Writer Ilya Ehrenburg
	A great river is unremarkable like a small stream at its source; hundreds and thousands of rivers and streams flow and merge with it, becoming deeper and wider; thus, the mighty river spans the continent, connecting countries and transforming the lives of millions. The peace movement originates from the depths of aroused hearts, it grows rapidly, traverses our era, and connects the people of all countries. This is an unprecedented movement. I am honored to speak at this noble congress, which represents not supporters of one or another ideology, not governments, nor certain temporary governments of some countries that hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat. No, this is a congress of people with different lives and different ideals, but who are eager to block the road to war.
	Here, we have heard powerful and enthusiastic speeches from representatives of those strata who were avoiding us not long ago. I would like to extend a heartfelt welcome to these representatives on behalf of the Soviet delegation. We know that we have many friends and like-minded people in the world. We also know that there are many people in the world who are taking different paths and pursuing different goals. We are honored to meet here not only like-minded people and friends, but also representatives from different parties, with different tendencies, living in different worlds. We do not intend to convince them of our justice, nor to refute their philosophical concepts and political propositions. What we want to discuss with them is how to enable all kinds of people and all nations to live peacefully on one earth, how to save all cities, all children, all dreams, and spare all this from the catastrophe of napalm bombs, atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs, from the suffering of ashes, tears and bloodshed.
	As a writer who should listen to the beating of hearts, as a person who has experienced two world wars and seen many sufferings and ruins, I want to say: We must do everything we can and strive to do everything we can, just to save peace!
	Recently, I saw the talk of US Senator Styles Bridges. He said: "The Korean War is not just a war in Korea, it is a world war; the fighting in Korea is only its most perceptible manifestation. The Third World War is not a future event. It has already begun. It began even before the end of the Second World War. The Third World War is the longest of all wars. ... We are now at war, and will probably be at war for many years to come. The president we elect will be a wartime president. Our economy will still be a war economy. ... As far as I know, no authoritative Republican or Democrat, no army general or navy general has any plan to stop this war. We cannot stop this war under any other circumstances except to achieve victory on a global scale." Senator Styles Bridges also said: "As far as I know, Generals Eisenhower, Bradley, MacArthur and the most responsible political leaders also hold this view of the war." I do not know what Senator Styles Bridges' knowledge of history is, or what kind of war he is predicting to mankind: seven years, thirty years, or a hundred years; but one thing is undeniable: if he is right, that is, if no authoritative Republican or Democrat, no army general or navy general has any plan to stop this war, then these gentlemen have many plans to prolong and expand the war.
	In the past, wars were waged on the grounds of safeguarding national interests, and because the national sovereignty and its honor had been damaged; even when carrying out plundering invasions, they sang the praises of national dignity. Now we see another situation: asking people to prepare for war, not for national interests, but against national interests. In the past, people were told that they had to sacrifice their lives to safeguard the independence of the country, but now some people are telling them that they should lose the independence of their own country, and doing so is only to sacrifice their lives later. This is simply a fool's dream. However, this is precisely the program of those figures mentioned by Senator Styles Bridges.
	The rulers of the country that began its existence with the Declaration of Independence now oppose the independence of other countries, and proclaim: "The concept of sovereignty is outdated and does not meet the requirements of the times."
	It is difficult to doubt that the Soviets are chauvinistic: people of all nationalities live in our country, we educate children to respect all nationalities, and the philosophy and politics of our society are inextricably linked to the concept of international solidarity. We never want to sanctify anything, especially not the concept of national sovereignty into some kind of dogma. At the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, when discussing the issue of disarmament, our friend Fadeyev, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, proposed the establishment of an effective international control organization. Of course, this kind of control would to some extent damage the absoluteness of national sovereignty. But for the safety of all countries, for the victory of peace, a country can give up a little of its own independence. However, the abandonment of national sovereignty advocated by the US rulers means something else: they suggest that all countries abandon their independence in order to strengthen one country, for the victory of war forces.
	I do not want to talk about the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for independence. These great nations with long-standing cultures, nations that have been deprived of the right to progress for the sake of false progress, have now awakened. The example of China, one of the cradles of human civilization, not only inspires its neighbors, but also awakens distant Tunisia. The people of Asia and Africa are fighting for their independence, and at the same time, they are fighting for the friendship and peace of all nations. I want to talk about the situation of some countries that, although they have many colonies, are now bound by other colonizers; I want to talk about the fate of some countries whose sovereignty is recognized by all countries, but is by no means respected by all countries.
	Some may ask me, why is the Soviet representative talking about things that primarily concern the countries of Western Europe and Latin America? There are several reasons why I talk about this issue. When the rulers in Washington deprived the countries of Western Europe and Latin America of their independence, they always waved the bogeyman of Soviet aggression. They say that if the British must live more poorly and behave more humbly, if the French and Italians must turn the ancient cities treasured by all mankind into bases for foreign troops, if the hardworking little Denmark must become an airport for "flying fortresses," if the Latin American republics must not only diligently supply their northern neighbors with raw materials and cannon fodder, then this is because we, the builders of the Volga-Don Canal, the planters of huge drought-resistant green walls, the people who defended Stalingrad and built Stalingrad, seem to be coveting the vineyards of France, the ancient monuments and relics of Rome, the remnants of British freedom and pride, and even the coffee of Brazil and the nitrates of Chile. As a Soviet representative, how can I not expose the despicable tricks of these people? They humiliate entire nations, insisting that everything that has happened is due to the sins of the Russians. Another reason why I have to talk about the issue of national independence in Western European countries is that Russian culture has had close ties with the cultures of other European countries since ancient times. We are representatives of Russian culture, and we cannot help but feel pained and indignant to see the great and glorious nations on our continent suffer poverty and humiliation. Those who infringe upon the national sovereignty of Italy, France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and the Latin American republics are trying to portray the victims as accomplices. They not only hinder cultural and economic ties, but also tarnish the reputation of the people. This situation must be stopped. And I want to say loudly: We Soviets have never, and will never, equate the criminals with their victims!
	The British "Times" wrote: "Even the most broad-minded Englishman should feel an instinctive indignation when he has to get permission from an American policeman to pass through British territory." The Americans have established a unique "surrender" order for their soldiers in Britain. Conservative Party member Marlowe said in the House of Commons that the British army did not have such rights in defeated France as the American army had in "allied" Britain. Labor Party member Silverman talked about the American shooting of Chinese prisoners of war who dared to sing the national anthem, and then said that if the British national anthem offended the ears of American officers and soldiers, then the Americans could kill Britons with impunity.
	The facts of American interference in the internal affairs of Western European and Latin American countries can be written into several large books. American ambassadors act as if they are governors. If American diplomats and generals still care about some superficial formalities in Britain, then they are not bound by formalities in other countries. All Greek newspapers expressed indignation at the American ambassador's open interference in the election campaign. However, representatives of the State Department rushed to express their support for the ambassador. As for the Dutch, they do not even have the right to watch their favorite dramas. Recently, the American ambassador formally rebuked some "prominent figures" for daring to go to the theater without the consent of the American embassy. "US News & World Report" narrated that the Americans cancelled an order to a factory in Italy that manufactured precision instruments because there were communists among the workers in this factory. Everyone knows that there are very few workers in Italy who can be considered "popular" by the Americans. Therefore, the American representatives want to make the Italians no longer Italian. Sometimes this kind of interference in the internal affairs of other countries is difficult to call diplomatic. Everyone still remembers that the United States loudly allocated 100 million US dollars to support subversives in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This kind of activity is also being carried out in the West. The Prime Minister of Hesse admitted that the murderous gang that attempted to eliminate many social democrats and liberals was organized by the American occupation authorities. The Belgian "People's Daily" wrote that the gang exposed in Hesse was a branch of a huge terrorist organization called the "Technical Service Society." In addition to West Germany, this organization is also active in France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Former US Ambassador to Argentina Braden said a month ago: "In fact, the United States is constantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, intentionally or unintentionally. ... The methods of interference include: propaganda, exerting diplomatic or economic pressure, intimidation or the use of force; it seems that this interference will continue until human nature changes. ..." I dare say that although I firmly believe in the significance of correct education, I do not think that the people of the world will wait for the nature of Mr. Braden and his leaders to change. It will take decades to re-educate these gentlemen; if it is difficult to teach them something, then it is possible to get rid of their habit of being overbearing first.
	The kind of interference mentioned by Mr. Braden is becoming more and more blatant. There is no need to talk about the countries of Latin America. Even the British, who are relatively privileged and known for their calmness, cannot bear it. The "Economist" wrote: "If two countries want to strangle each other in trade, then it is impossible to become allies in politics and military affairs." The "Daily Mirror" said: "The United States habitually treats Britain like a poor relative, either scolding, giving the cold shoulder, or ignoring it." The "Daily Mail" pointed out: "If our positions continue to be lost here and lost there, then they will soon be completely lost..."
	The recent remarks of the President of the French Republic and former Prime Minister Herriot revealed the anxiety that permeates all strata of France. French political commentator Laville said this in the "Political and Economic Yearbook": "Our 'federalists' cleverly lie, calling a place that is not even as large as the western half of our continent Europe. If we pay a little attention to the truth, we will not loudly repeat such nonsense as 'European Federation,' but say that it is a disintegrating Europe. ... As long as you visit our Western countries, or stay in France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, and Norway, and stay a little longer in Britain, you will see that what rules these countries is an out-and-out American protection system ... And tomorrow, when the deafening roar of the guns of the German Wehrmacht comes, the protection system will actually take on a new form: what will dominate unfortunate Europe will be the German-American rule, because the dream that the American rulers, who are dizzy with anti-Moscow sentiment, dream day and night is to hand over the power possessed by the Nazi leaders to Hitler's disciples and grandchildren."
	We all remember the harsh words that General Eisenhower used to insult France and the French people. We all remember the outrageous reprimands of Italy by Admiral Carney's pet reporters. The crudely made Berchtesgaden dictionary has been revived. The large business organization "Committee for Economic Development" issued a statement saying: "The American people agree to shoulder the burden of world leaders." It is difficult to say that these big businessmen can represent the American people. However, even if the Americans agree to "shoulder the burden of ruling the world," the people of the world will never agree to shoulder the burden of slaves.
	The "New York Times" correspondent in Paris wrote: "In the era of Louis XIV, people said: When France sneezes, the whole of Europe catches a cold. Now we can say: When the United States sneezes, the entire Western world catches a cold." Needless to say, the American rulers sneeze with great vigor. Here I am reminded of a Russian proverb: "No matter what sneeze, it is not greeting you," but I want to focus on another matter. In the era of Louis XIV, France gave Europe Pascal, Racine, Moliere, La Fontaine, Poussin and others. But it is difficult for anyone to seriously say that the country that has recently benefited the Western world with stupid senators' long speeches, "Reader's Digest" and plague fleas is a cultural leader. Western Europe sometimes calls the United States "Uncle Sam." This reminds people of the moneybags of wealthy relatives, rather than their spiritual growth. Wouldn't it be more accurate to think of it as a nephew who is disobedient because he understands very little?
	I would never insult the American people by saying this. The American people are capable, energetic, and hardworking. The Americans do not have a long history, so they do not have experience. Therefore, as we have seen, they are easily deceived. Many of them believe or want to believe that napalm bombs safeguard human dignity, that the residents of Michigan and Oklahoma are truly helping the unfortunate Parisians and Romans, and that a newspaper editor in Oxford (Mississippi) who listens to Shakespeare with one ear while listing Darwin as a "red" is saving the current Oxford University from the hands of the "Eastern barbarians."
	However, the American people have begun to personally feel the burden of war and the bloodshed in Korea. The American rulers have tried every means to prevent many American citizens from participating in the World People's Peace Congress. However, our dear Chairman Joliot-Curie is right, ideas do not need visas to travel. The truth about the World People's Peace Congress will be transmitted to millions of Americans. They know that we gather here not to bring spiritual and material harm to the American people, but only to find ways to prevent war. Millions of Americans know that the Soviet people do not want their land and their wealth, nor do they want the land of their allies; the Soviet people do not intend to undermine the "American way of life" in secret; the Soviet people agree to live peacefully with any kind of America, no matter what kind of president it elects, no matter what kind of system it likes, no matter what its life ideals are. Sooner or later, the American people will get rid of their lonely situation and free themselves from the terrible nightmare caused by a group of people with delusions of grandeur and another group of people with persecution mania. For the happiness of the American people and for the happiness of all the people in the world, I hope this happens sooner rather than later. However, the people of other countries, especially our European people with a long history, much experience, and many achievements, cannot wait for that newspaper editor in Oxford (Mississippi) to wake up. The European people are responsible for the past and for the future. Their ancestors established countries that were vast or narrow, but they were great in terms of national genius. It is precisely in this way that they enriched human culture: Paris was built by the French, Goethe by the Germans, and Cervantes cannot be taken away from the soul of Spain.
	All those who cherish precious diversity and the spiritual wealth of mankind are happy to see that the people of Latin American countries, who have brilliantly fused ancient civilizations, the Aztecs or Mayans (Native Americans - Translator's Note) and the culture of the Iberian Peninsula, can now use the equality of all races to counter American racism, use the high achievements of literature and art to counter the neon lights of Broadway and the tricks of Hollywood, and use the labor and achievements of ordinary people in Brazil or Chile, Argentina or Mexico to counter the worship of the dollar.
	The World People's Peace Congress is being convened in days that we have the right to call a great turning point. The American rulers have begun to understand how unrealistic their idea of ruling the world is. According to the President of "International News Service" reporting from Paris: "Trust in the United States as a leader in international affairs is now extremely low. ... Even government leaders are participating in creating anti-American sentiment." A United Press reporter confirmed: "Anti-American sentiment in Europe is growing, and in France, this sentiment has reached a very dangerous point." "Time" magazine admitted that the United States is losing Latin American countries one after another: "We lost Argentina, Bolivia, Guatemala, Ecuador, and finally Chile." The United Press wrote about military conventions: "Brazil cannot be expected, and even Uruguay cannot be expected."
	"American Courier" magazine pushes all the blame onto the neutralists. This magazine said: "Neutralists are a greater threat to Western Europe than communists." Of course, the danger to Western Europe spoken of by those warmongering Americans cannot be understood literally. What "American Courier" magazine is uneasy about is that awakened Europeans are threatening American rule. Isn't that right, a publication related to neutralists, called "Observer Weekly," recently published under the following subheading: "Eisenhower is in power. Long live independent Europe!". The mood of those with clear minds is easy to understand. They have begun to consider the consequences of various dangerous alliances. Only a few years ago, many of them still believed in the threat of Soviet aggression. Seeing that they were deceived, seeing that the people of Western European countries must first live in semi-starvation and then be subjected to the fate of Hiroshima, patriots from various countries began to consider how to get rid of the snare of the Atlantic Pact. If I said before that we would not regard the victims as criminals, I must now emphasize again: we will never equate those countries that do not have foreign troops on their own territory and sincerely adhere to neutrality with those who participate in aggression. A noble sense of patriotism dominates the millions of people whom "American Courier" magazine calls neutralists. We believe that it is difficult for the people of one country to escape the flood, and it is easier for the people of all countries to unite to prevent the flood. I believe that the most far-sighted neutralists understand that only an agreement between major powers can guarantee the real security of all nations, large and small. Correctly understanding neutralism will lead to participation in the struggle for peace, because a person who wants to save his family cannot be indifferent to what is happening on the next street.
	We may have some differences with neutralists in understanding the common task of the struggle for peace, but as long as neutralists oppose the forces of aggression, we welcome them, support them, and move forward with them side by side. Can't the struggle of neutralists in West Germany serve as a mirror? This struggle began when German patriots told the forces of war: "We will not participate." This struggle has led the German neutralists to the point where they now say to the forces of peace:
	"We are with you."
	Neutralism is another sign of the struggle of the people of Western countries for their independence. The myth about the Soviet threat has come to an end. Everyone knows that American journalist Lippmann wrote: "The people of European countries and their governments believe the Soviet government's words: the Red Army will not attack them. This confidence is the basis of the program of resistance to the Atlantic Pact and the main source of resentment towards us."
	The "Observer Weekly" said that now, at the end of 1952, what the French bourgeoisie thinks is different from what they thought five years ago. They no longer believe in the possibility of "Eastern aggression," and they have risen up to resist American dictatorship. Many things in the world have changed in the past year. It is precisely because of this that what can be convened in Vienna is not a peace supporters' congress, but a much broader congress—the World People's Peace Congress. Yes, now it is not some political parties, factions, and movements that support peace, but the people of all countries!
	On behalf of the Soviet delegation, I propose that the noble congress affirm the inalienable right of the people of the world to national independence and the right to live in their own way without being dictated by others. The way of life in Belgium, Guatemala, or Iran should be respected as much as the way of life in the United States. People of different ideas can help each other and exchange books and discoveries, raw materials and products. The principle of reciprocity must be observed here, and the equality of all sovereign countries must be recognized. The security of all countries in the world must be guaranteed by the following conditions: concluding a convention between major powers, abolishing various aggressive groups, abiding by existing treaties of friendship and mutual assistance, and making the United Nations once again abide by the principles on which it was founded. There is a smart old saying in France: "The coal miner is the master of his own house." Well, let me end my speech with the following words: "Long live the coal miner—the master of his own house!"

    在世界人民和平大会十二月十三日晚间会议上
    苏联作家伊利亚·爱伦堡的演说
    万里江河在发源的地方是像小溪一样不惹人注意的；千百条河流、小溪奔来和它们汇合，它们越来越深、越来越宽；于是，浩荡的江河横跨大陆，把各国沟通起来，使千百万人的生活起着变化。和平运动从激愤的心灵深处发源，它迅速成长壮大，穿过我们这个时代，把各国人民联系起来。这是一个空前未有的运动。我很荣幸地能在这个崇高的大会上讲话，这个大会代表的不是这一种或那一种思想的拥护者，不是政府，也不是某些国家那些挂羊头卖狗肉的暂时的政府。不，这是生活不同、理想不同但却切望阻塞战争道路的人民举行的大会。
    在这里，我们听到了不久以前还在回避我们的那些阶层的代表们有力的热烈的演说。我愿代表苏联代表团衷心地欢迎这些代表。我们知道，世界上我们有许多朋友和思想一致的人。我们也知道，世界上有许多走着别的道路，追求着别的目标的人。我们感到荣幸的是，在这里我们不仅会见了思想一致的人和朋友，而且也会见了来自不同党派、有着不同的倾向、居住在不同世界里的代表。我们不打算使他们相信我们的正义，不打算辩驳他们的哲学观念和政治主张。我们要跟他们商讨的是，如何使各种人、各种民族在一个地球上和平相处，如何拯救一切城市、一切儿童、一切梦想，使这一切免于凝固汽油弹、免于原子弹或氢弹的浩劫，免于灰烬、眼泪和流血的苦难。
    作为一个应该倾听人心深处跳动的作家，作为一个身经两次世界大战、见过许多许多苦难和废墟的人，我要说：必须做我们所能做到的和勉力能够做到的一切，只是为了拯救和平！
    最近我看到了美国参议员斯泰尔斯·布里奇斯的谈话。他说：“朝鲜战争不单单是朝鲜的战争，这是世界大战；在朝鲜的战斗不过是它的最使人可以感触到的表现罢了。第三次世界大战并不是将来的事。它已经开始了。甚至在第二次世界大战结束以前它就开始了。第三次世界大战是一切战争中最长久的一次战争。……我们现在处于战争状态，大概将来许多年都要处于战争状态。我们选举的总统将是战时的总统。我们的经济仍将是战争经济。……就我所知，没有一个权威的共和党人或民主党人、没有一个陆军将领或海军将领有任何停止这个战争的计划。除了取得世界范围的胜利外，我们不能在任何其他的情况下停止这个战争。”斯泰尔斯·布里奇斯参议员又说：“据我所知，艾森豪威尔、布莱德雷、麦克阿瑟等将军以及最负责的政治领袖对战争也持有这样的看法。”我不知道，斯泰尔斯·布里奇斯参议员的历史知识怎样，他向人类预言的是怎样的战争：七年的，三十年的，还是一百年的；不过有一件事是无可争辩的：如果他说得对的话，就是说没有一个权威的共和党人或民主党人、没有一个陆军将领或海军将领有任何停止这个战争的计划的话，那么这些先生们就有着许多延长和扩大战争的计划了。
    以往战争是以维护民族利益、以国家主权和它的荣誉遭受损害为理由进行的；甚至进行掠夺的进犯时，也高唱什么民族尊严。现在我们看到另一种情形：要求人民准备战争，不是为了民族利益，而是违反民族利益。从前是向人们宣传，为了维护国家的独立，得牺牲他们的生命，而现在却有人对他们说，他们应该丧失自己国家的独立，而这样做只是为了以后牺牲他们的生命。这简直像痴人说梦。然而这正是斯泰尔斯·布里奇斯参议员所讲的那些人物的纲领。
    那个以独立宣言开始生存的国家底执政者现在反对其他国家的独立了，并且宣传说：“主权这个概念已经过时了，不合乎时代的要求了。” 
    很难怀疑苏联人有沙文主义：在我们国家生活着各种民族的人，我们教育儿童尊重一切民族，我们社会的哲学和政治跟国际团结的观念有着不可分割的联系。我们决不想把什么东西奉为神圣，尤其不想把国家主权的观念变为某种教条。在华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会讨论裁减军备问题时，我们的朋友法捷耶夫曾代表苏联代表团提议建立一个有效的国际管制机构。当然，这种管制在某种程度上会损害国家主权的绝对性。但是为了一切国家的安全，为了和平的胜利，一个国家可以放弃一点点自己的独立。而美国执政者所鼓吹的放弃国家主权，却意味着别的：他们建议一切国家为了加强一个国家、为了战争力量的胜利放弃自己的独立。
    我不想谈亚洲和非洲人民争取独立的斗争。这些具有悠久文化的伟大的民族，曾经为了虚假的进步被剥夺了进步的权利的民族，现在已经醒来了。人类文明的摇篮之一——中国的榜样不仅鼓舞着它的邻国，而且使遥远的突尼斯起来了。亚洲和非洲的人民为自己的独立而斗争，同时也是为各国人民的友爱、和平而斗争。我要谈谈这样一些国家的状况，它们有许多虽然拥有殖民地，现在却受到别的殖民者的束缚；我要谈谈这样一些国家的命运，它们的主权为所有的国家所承认，但却决不是为所有的国家所尊重。
    可能有人要问我，为什么苏联代表谈到那些首先涉及西欧和拉丁美洲国家的事情。有几个理由使我谈到这个问题。华盛顿的执政者剥夺西欧和拉丁美洲国家的独立的时候，总是摇幌着苏联侵略这个稻草人。他们说，如果英国人必须生活得比较穷困些而且行为比较谦恭些，如果法国人和意大利人必须把全人类所宝贵的古城变成外国军队的基地，如果爱好劳动的小丹麦必须成为“飞行堡垒”的飞机场，如果拉丁美洲各共和国不仅必须勤谨地给它们的北邻供应原料和炮灰，那么，这是因为我们，伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑者，植造庞大的防旱绿墙的人，曾经保卫住斯大林格勒和建设起斯大林格勒的人，好像在觊觎着法国的葡萄园、罗马的古迹古物、英国的自由和骄傲的残余、甚至巴西的咖啡和智利的硝石。我作为苏联代表，怎能不揭穿这些人的卑鄙手法呢？他们使整个整个的民族受屈辱，硬要使人相信，所发生的一切都是由于俄罗斯人的罪过。使我不得不谈到西欧国家民族独立问题的还有一个原因：俄罗斯文化从古以来就和其他欧洲国家文化有着密切的联系，我们是俄罗斯文化的代表人，我们眼看我们大陆上伟大光荣的民族遭受贫穷和屈辱，不能不痛心，不能不愤慨。那些侵犯意大利、法国、比利时、丹麦、挪威、拉丁美洲各共和国的国家主权的人们，企图把受害的说成同谋犯。他们不仅阻碍着文化和经济的联系，而且玷污着人民的名声。必须制止这种情形。而且我要高声地说：我们苏联人从来，也永远不把罪犯和他们的牺牲者等同看待！
    英国“泰晤士报”写道：“甚至抱有最广泛见解的英国人，当他必须得到美国警察的允许才能在英国领土上通行时，都该会感到本能的愤慨。”美国人在英国给他们的士兵建立了独特的“投降”秩序。保守党党员马劳在下院说，英国军队在战败的法国也没有像美国军队在“同盟的”英国这样的权利。工党党员锡尔弗曼谈到了美国人枪杀敢于唱国歌的中国战俘，接着便说，如果英国国歌刺了美国官兵的耳朵，那么美国人可以打死英国人而逍遥法外。
    美国干涉西欧和拉丁美洲各国内政的事实可以写成几大本书。美国的大使们俨然以总督自居。如果说美国的外交官和将军们在英国还顾着一些表面的礼节的话，那么在其他国家就不受礼节的约束了。所有的希腊报纸都对美国大使公开干涉选举运动表示愤愤不满。但是国务院代表就赶忙表示支持大使。至于荷兰人，他们竟连看自己所喜爱的戏剧的权利都没有了。最近美国大使正式申斥了一些“显要人物”，因为他们竟敢没有经美国大使馆的同意就到戏院里去。“美国新闻与世界报道”叙述道，美国人在意大利取消了对一家制造精确仪器工厂的订货，因为这家工厂的工人中间有共产党员。大家知道，意大利的工人中间很少有能被美国人认为是“受欢迎者”的人。因此，美国的代表们要使意大利人不再是意大利人。有时候这种干涉别国内政的情形很难叫人说是什么外交性质的了。大家都还记得，美国曾大叫大嚷地拨款一亿美元支持在苏联和人民民主国家中的颠覆分子。而这种活动也在西方进行着。黑森州的总理承认，企图消灭许多社会民主党员和自由党员的杀人匪帮就是美国占领当局组织的。比利时的“人民报”写道，在黑森州被揭露出来的匪帮是一个名叫“技术服务社”的庞大恐怖组织的分会。这个组织除了西德以外还在法国、意大利、比利时及荷兰等国活动。前美国驻阿根廷大使布莱敦一个月以前说过：“实际上，美国有意无意地不断干涉别国内政。……干涉的方式有：宣传，施以外交或经济上的压力，恐吓或使用武力；看样子，这种干涉还要继续下去，直到人的本性改变为止。……”我敢说，虽然我十分相信正确教育的意义，可是我却不以为世界人民会等待布莱敦先生和他的领导人的本性改变。要重新教育这些先生们需要几十年；如果说教会他们某些东西是困难的话，那末先除掉他们那种喧宾夺主的恶习是可以的。
    布莱敦先生所说到的那种干涉已越来越露骨了。不必谈拉丁美洲的国家了，甚至那些比较享有特权和以沉静出名的英国人也忍受不住了。“经济学家”周刊写道：“如果两个国家在贸易上你要扼杀我、我要扼杀你，那末在政治和军事上就不可能成为同盟者。”“每日镜报”说道：“美国惯常对待英国就像对待穷亲戚一样，不是训斥、冷眼，就是不睬不理。”“每日邮报”指出：“如果我们的阵地不断地这里也丧失掉，那里也丧失掉，那么很快就会丧失殆尽了……”
    法兰西共和国总统以及前总理赫里欧先生近来的言论中透露了笼罩法国各阶层的忧虑不安。法国政论家拉维尔涅先生在“政治经济年报”上这样描述道：“我们的‘联邦主义者’巧妙地撒谎，把还没有我们大陆西半部那么大的一块地方叫做欧洲。如果我们稍微顾到一点真理的话，我们就不会大声重复‘欧洲联邦’这样的鬼话，而说这是分崩离析的欧洲了。……只要去巡访一下我们西方的国家，或者在法国、在德国、在意大利、在比、荷、卢、在丹麦、在挪威逗留一下，也稍微在英国逗留一下，你就会看到，统治着这些国家的是不折不扣的美国保护制度……而明天，当德国国防军的枪炮震耳的轰响声传来的时候，保护制度实际上就要采取新的形式了：威临着不幸的欧洲的将是德美的统治，因为，反莫斯科反得昏头昏脑的美国执政者朝夕思慕的梦想，是把像纳粹领袖所拥有的实力交给希特勒的徒子徒孙。”
    我们都记得艾森豪威尔将军侮辱法国和法国人民的那些难听的话。我们都记得海军上将卡涅的御用记者对意大利的令人愤慨的斥责。粗制滥造的贝许斯加登字典又复活了。大商人的组织“经济发展委员会”发表声明说：“美国人民同意负起世界领导人的担子。”这些大商人很难说能代表美国人民说话。但是，即使美国人同意“负起统治世界的担子”，世界人民也决不会同意负起奴隶的担子。
    “纽约时报”驻巴黎记者写道：“在路易十四时代，人们说：法国打个喷嚏，全欧洲都伤了风。现在我们可以说：美国打个喷嚏，整个西方世界都伤了风。”不用说，美国统治者喷嚏打得是神气十足的。这里我想起了俄罗斯的一句谚语：“打什么喷嚏都不是向你问安”，不过我想着重谈另一件事。在路易十四时代，法国给了欧洲帕斯卡尔、拉辛、莫里哀、拉芳登、浦生等人。可是很难有谁能够认真地说最近拿愚蠢的参议员又臭又长的演说、“读者文摘”和鼠疫跳蚤来造福西方世界的国家是文化的领导者。西欧有时把美国叫做“山姆大叔”。这是想起了发了财的亲戚的钱袋，而不是由于他的精神上的成长。这就好比一个侄儿，他懂事很少就不听话了，这样想不更正确吗？
    我这样说，决不会侮辱美国的人民，美国人民是能干的、精力充沛的、爱好劳动的。美国人过去没有悠久的历史，因而没有经验，所以，像我们所看到的，他们很轻易地被欺骗着。他们很多人相信或是要相信：凝固汽油弹维护着人类尊严，密执安和俄克拉何马的居民真正帮助着遭遇恶运的巴黎人和罗马人，牛津城（密士失比州）一个用一只耳朵听莎士比亚同时又把达尔文列入“赤色分子”的报纸编辑是在从“东方野蛮人”的手中拯救现今的牛津大学。
    但是美国人民已开始亲身感受到战争的重负、朝鲜的流血了。美国统治者千方百计阻止许多美国公民参加世界人民和平大会。不过，我们亲爱的主席约里奥—居里说得对，思想旅行用不着签证。世界人民和平大会的真情实况将传到千百万美国人那里。他们知道，我们聚会这里并不是为了带给美国人民精神上和物质上的损害，而仅仅是为了设法防止战争。千百万美国人知道，苏联人民既不想要他们的土地和他们的财富，也不想要他们的同盟者的土地；苏联人民并不打算暗中破坏“美国生活方式”；苏联人民同意与任何样的美国和平相处，不管它选举的是什么样的总统，不管它喜欢什么制度，不管它的人生理想是什么。迟早美国人民会脱离孤独的处境，从一批有自大狂的人和另一批有迫害狂的人引起的可怖噩梦中解脱出来。为了美国人民的幸福、也为了全世界一切人民的幸福，我希望这件事早点发生，不要太晚。可是其他国家的人民、首先是我们历史悠久的、经历很多的、有着许多成就的欧洲人民，是等不得牛津城（密士失比州）那位报纸编辑醒悟过来的。欧洲人民对过去和对将来都负有责任。他们的祖先建立了幅员广阔的或者幅员狭小的国家，但是就民族的天才来说，它们都是伟大的，它们正是这样丰富了人类的文化：巴黎是法兰西人建筑起来的，哥德是德国人，塞万提斯不能从西班牙的心灵中夺去。
    所有珍贵多种多样性和人类的精神财富的人都很高兴地看到，把古代的文明、阿兹推克人或马雅人
    （美洲土人——译者注）和伊比利安半岛的文化出色地熔合起来的拉丁美洲各国人民，现在能够拿一切种族的平等来对抗美国的种族主义，能够用高度的文学和艺术的成就来对抗百老汇的霓虹灯和好莱坞的把戏，用巴西或智利、阿根廷或墨西哥的普通人的劳动和功绩来对抗对美元的崇拜。
    世界人民和平大会是在我们有权称之为伟大转折的日子里召开的。美国的统治者已经开始明白，他们统治世界的想法是多么不现实。据“国际新闻社”社长自巴黎报道：“对美国作为国际事务领导者的信任现在已经极端低落了。……甚至政府的领袖们也参加制造反美的情绪。”一个合众社记者证实：“欧洲的反美情绪在增长中，在法国，这种情绪已到达了非常危险的地步。”“时代”杂志承认，美国一个接着一个地失去拉丁美洲国家：“我们失去了阿根廷、玻利维亚、危地马拉、厄瓜多尔，最后还失去了智利。”合众社论述军事公约时写道：“不能够指望巴西，甚至也不能够指望乌拉圭。”
    “美国信使”杂志把一切罪过都推到中立主义者的身上。这个杂志说：“中立主义者对西欧的威胁比共产党人还要厉害。”当然，那种好战成性的美国人所说的西欧危险，是不能按它的字面来了解的。“美国信使”杂志不安的是：醒悟了的欧洲人威胁着美国的统治。可不是吗，一家和中立主义者有关系的刊物，名字就叫“观察家周报”，不久以前在这样的小标题下出版了：“艾森豪威尔上台了。独立的欧洲万岁！”。那些头脑清醒的人的心情是容易理解的，他们已开始考虑到各种危险的联盟的后果了。只不过几年以前，他们有许多人还在相信苏联侵略的威胁。各国爱国人士因为看到了他们受骗，看到了西欧各国的人民首先要过半饥饿的生活，然后将遭到广岛的命运，就开始考虑如何摆脱大西洋公约的罗网。如果说我以前说过我们不会把牺牲者看成凶犯，现在就要再强调一下：我们绝不把这些本国领土上没有外国军队并真诚遵守中立的国家和那些侵略的参与者等同看待。崇高的爱国主义感支配着千百万被“美国信使”杂志叫做中立主义者的人。我们认为，单是一国的人民要免于洪水是困难的，各国人民团结起来防止洪水，就比较容易了。我相信，最有远见的中立主义者懂得，只有各大国达成协议才能保证全世界大小民族的真正安全。正确地了解中立主义，就会参加争取和平的斗争，因为一个想救自己家庭的人，就不能对邻街发生的事情漠不关心。
    在对争取和平斗争的共同任务的理解方面，我们也许和中立主义者有所分歧，但只要中立主义者反对侵略势力，我们就欢迎他们，支持他们，和他们并肩前进。西德中立主义者的斗争难道不可以作为借镜吗？这个斗争开始时，德国爱国人士告诉战争力量说：“我们不参加”。这个斗争已把德国的中立主义者引导到这一步，他们现在对和平力量说：
    “我们和你们一起”。
    中立主义是西方各国人民为自己的独立而斗争的又一个征兆。关于苏联威胁的神话已经寿终正寝了。大家知道的美国记者李普曼写道：“欧洲各国人民和他们的政府相信苏联政府的话：红军是不会进攻他们的。这种信心就是反抗大西洋公约的纲领的基础，也是对我们产生愤慨情绪的主要源泉。”
    “观察家周报”说，现在，一九五二年底，法国资产阶级所想的已和五年以前不同了，他们不再相信“东方侵略”的可能性了，他们起来反抗美国的独裁了。一年来，世界上许多事情都变了。正因为如此，所以能在维也纳召开的不是和平拥护者大会，而是范围广泛得多的大会——世界人民和平大会。是的，现在拥护和平的已经不是一些政党、派别、运动，而是各国人民了！
    我代表苏联代表团建议崇高的大会确认世界人民有不可剥夺的民族独立的权利，有不听别人的指使、按自己的方式生活的权利。比利时、危地马拉或者伊朗的生活方式应该和美国的生活方式受到同样的尊重。思想不同的各国人民可以互相帮助，交换书籍和发现、原料和产品。这里必须遵守互惠的原则，承认一切自主国的平等。世界各国的安全必须以这样一些条件来保证：缔结大国公约，取消各种侵略集团，遵守现有的各种友好互助条约，使联合国重新遵守作为它成立基础的各种原则。法国有一句聪明的老话：“挖煤的，是自己家里的主人。”好吧，就让我用下面的话结束我的演说罢：“挖煤的——自己家里的主人万岁！”  （新华社）
