    A large number of saplings withered outside Dongbianmen, the Beijing Construction Company should conduct an inspection
    Comrade Editor: Several hundred two- or three-year-old to ten-year-old cypress saplings temporarily planted in the open space in the Jianguo Li area outside Dongbianmen in Beijing have now mostly withered. As far as I know, these saplings were temporarily planted here by the Beijing Construction Company in the autumn of 1951. The main reasons for the die-off are the excessively close spacing of the temporary planting (some were even buried in the soil in whole bundles) and the long duration of the temporary planting. Why not transplant these saplings to the intended planting site? These conifer seedlings are relatively valuable, and the cultivation of each seedling requires a lot of manpower and resources. It is such a pity to let such a large number of saplings wither and die like this!
    I hope that the Beijing Construction Company will investigate this matter, and at the same time, I hope that all nurseries will first review the specific plans of the tree planting departments when supplying seedlings in the future, and then allocate the seedlings according to the situation.

### 东便门外大批树苗枯死北京市建筑公司应进行检查

    东便门外大批树苗枯死北京市建筑公司应进行检查
    编辑同志：北京市东便门外建国里一带空地上假植的几百株二、三年生至十几年生的柏树苗，现在已经大部枯死了。据我知道，这些树苗是北京市建筑公司在一九五一年秋季假植在这里的。所以枯死的原因，主要是假植的间隔太挤（有的甚至整捆地埋在土里）和假植的时间太久。为什么不把这些树苗移植在预定栽植的地方呢？这些针叶树的苗木是比较贵重的，同时每一株苗木的培育都要付出不少人力和物力。像这样大量的树苗，随便就让它们枯死，实在可惜！
    我希望北京市建筑公司对这件事情加以检查，同时希望各苗圃在今后供应苗木时，要先审查植树部门的具体计划，然后再根据情况拨付苗木。  汤又新
