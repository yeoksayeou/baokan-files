    Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: The people of West Germany continue to struggle against the Bonn and Paris war treaties. According to TASS, the people of Fürth, West Germany, recently held demonstrations and rallies to protest the ratification of the Bonn War Treaty. Social Democrats, Communists, non-partisan workers, the unemployed, disabled veterans, and housewives participated in the march. They demanded immediate negotiations on German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany. Residents of Fürth shouted to the marching crowd: "We need lasting peace! Down with Adenauer!"
    The German Movement for Unity, Peace, and Freedom recently held a conference in Lörrach. The three hundred local residents who attended the conference unanimously condemned Adenauer's attempt to ratify the Bonn and Paris war treaties.
    A delegation from the Hamburg branch of the German Democratic Women's League recently wrote a letter to Margarete Grewe, a Christian Democratic Union member of the Bundestag in Bonn, protesting her vote in the Bundestag in favor of the Bonn and Paris treaties. The letter stated: "What we demand is not civil war but German unification. We do not want our husbands and children to bleed on the battlefield for the benefit of others."
    At rallies held in Hamburg-Blankenese, the working people of Sest, the young peace fighters of Duisburg, and many others protested against the revanchist militarist policies of Bonn and the Bonn War Treaty.
    On the streets of Sest, posters put up by workers read: "In 1933, we said: Hitler means war. Now we say: 'General Treaty' means war. Therefore, the people in cities and villages across the country should unite against this treaty."
    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Berlin News: According to the "National Daily" report, Bonn government "Interior Minister" Lehr stated at a recent secret meeting of the Bonn "government" that West German authorities are prepared to take large-scale repressive measures against West German peace and democratic forces. The first targets of the crackdown are the German Communist Party and some people who advocate peaceful reunification of Germany, including former German Chancellor Dr. Wirth, in order to crack down on the peaceful reunification movement and facilitate the ratification of the "General Treaty" and the "European Army Agreement" and step up the arming of West Germany. Among the people's organizations mentioned by Lehr as being subject to persecution are also the German-Soviet Friendship Association, the Free German Youth League, and the Cultural League and other democratic organizations.
    The Bonn government's new persecution plan was drawn up in accordance with American instructions. According to the German News Agency, one of Eisenhower's chief military advisors, former US Military Governor of West Germany Clay, telegraphed the President of the West Berlin Senate, saying that Eisenhower's new US government and his representatives in West Germany will take "clear and decisive action" against the German Communist Party, other peace organizations in West Germany, and sympathizers. As a preparatory step for the suppression, the Bonn Bundestag has formally discussed the cancellation of the parliamentary privileges of German Communist Party members Lehmann, Rehsich, Renner, Fische, Müller, Paul, and Mrs. Strubach.
    However, this huge conspiracy of the American and German reactionaries to prepare for war suffered a setback from the very beginning. Under the surging tide of the West German people opposing war treaties and demanding a peacefully unified Germany, many bourgeois members of parliament did not dare to openly support the Adenauer government's fascist repression plan. On the 22nd, the Bonn Bundestag rejected the Adenauer government's proposal to revoke the parliamentary privileges of the German Communist Party members by a vote of 145 to 144.

    西德人民加强反对波恩战争条约的斗争
    【新华社二十日讯】西德人民继续进行反对波恩和巴黎战争条约的斗争。据塔斯社讯：西德佛尔特的人民最近曾举行示威游行和集会，抗议批准波恩战争条约。社会民主党人、共产党人、无党无派的工人、失业者、残废退伍军人和家庭妇女都参加了这次游行。他们要求立即就德国统一问题进行谈判并与统一的德国缔结和约。佛尔特的居民向游行队伍高呼：“我们需要持久和平！打倒阿登纳！”
    德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会最近曾在勒拉赫召开一次大会。参加大会的三百名当地居民一致谴责阿登纳企图批准波恩和巴黎战争条约。
    德国民主妇女联合会汉堡支会的代表团最近写了一封信给波恩联邦议院中的基督教民主党议员玛格丽格·格雷维尔，抗议她在联邦议院投票赞成波恩和巴黎条约。信中说：“我们要求的不是内战而是德国的统一。我们不愿我们的丈夫和孩子为了别人的利益而在战场上流血。”
    在汉堡—布兰肯西举行的大会上，塞斯特的劳动人民、杜伊斯堡的青年和平战士以及许多其他人都抗议波恩报复主义者的军国主义政策和波恩战争条约。
    在塞斯特的大街上，工人张贴的标语上面写着：“在一九三三年，我们说过：希特勒就是战争。现在我们说：‘一般性条约’就是战争。因此，全国的城市和乡村中的人民都应联合起来反对这个条约。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】柏林消息：据“国民日报”报道，波恩政府“内政部长”勒尔在波恩“政府”最近举行的一次秘密会议上表示：西德当局准备对西德和平民主力量采取大规模的镇压措施，镇压的第一批对象是德国共产党及包括前德意志帝国总理维尔特博士在内的一些主张德国和平统一的人士，以打击和平统一运动，并便利批准“一般性条约”和“欧洲军协定”和加紧武装西德。在勒尔提到的要受到迫害的人民团体中还有德苏友好协会、自由德国青年联盟和文化联盟等民主组织。
    波恩政府的新的迫害计划是根据美国的指示拟订的。据德意志通讯社报道，艾森豪威尔的主要军师之一、前美国驻西德军事总督克莱，曾打电报给西柏林参议院院长说，艾森豪威尔领导的美国新政府与他在西德的代表，将对德国共产党、西德其他和平组织及同情者采取“明确与断然的行动”。作为镇压的预备步骤，波恩联邦议院内已正式讨论取消德国共产党议员雷曼、雷熙、雷纳、费希、缪勒、保罗和史特露巴赫夫人等人的议员特权案。
    但是，美、德反动派这一准备战争的巨大阴谋一开始就遭到挫折。在西德人民反对战争条约、要求和平统一的德国的汹涌浪潮下，许多资产阶级的议员也不敢公开支持阿登纳政府的法西斯镇压计划。二十二日，波恩联邦议院以一百四十五票对一百四十四票否决了阿登纳政府提出的要求取消德共议员的议员特权的提案。
