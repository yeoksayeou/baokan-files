Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Yoshida Cabinet finally approved the general budget draft for the 1953 fiscal year on the 17th, preparing to submit it to the Diet for approval in late January. At the request of the ruling Liberal Party, the total budget expenditure increased to over 962 billion yen (equivalent to over US$2.67 billion), breaking the record for post-war Japanese budgets.

    The Yoshida government's budget draft was formulated based on the policy of re-militarization. It allocated a huge sum of over 200 billion yen for direct military expenses and the maintenance of US troops stationed in Japan, including so-called "defense" expenses of 145 billion yen – 83 billion yen for the "Security Agency" and 62 billion yen for disguised "occupation costs." Under these circumstances, the Japanese fiscal balance, which had been forcibly maintained in balance since 1949 under the instructions of Detroit banker Dodge, the newly appointed Director of the Budget Bureau of the Eisenhower government, is now beginning to show cracks. In the new budget draft, the Yoshida government proposed for the first time to "borrow" 30 billion yen by issuing so-called "tax savings bonds" to balance the Japanese budget. Not only that, according to a Tokyo dispatch from International News Service, "Financial experts point out that the inflationary factors in the new budget are not only the proposed 30 billion yen in 'tax savings bonds' to be issued, but also the policy decision to allow the state-owned Railway Corporation and the Electrical Communications Corporation to issue bonds totaling 22 billion yen." These "financial experts" doubt that the public will be enthusiastic about buying these bonds, "and this will lead to inflation due to the printing of banknotes." This means that the Yoshida government intends to directly or indirectly force the general public to "borrow" 52 billion yen in the new fiscal year, in addition to heavy taxes.

    The Yoshida government's new budget draft has aroused widespread concern and opposition. Financial circles and opposition parties are worried that the huge budget will cause inflation, and opposition parties have expressed their demands to revise the budget draft.

    吉田政府通过庞大新预算草案
    各反对党纷纷主张修改
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：吉田内阁在十七日最后通过了一九五三会计年度一般预算草案，准备在一月下旬提交国会通过。在执政的自由党的要求下，预算岁出总额增加到九千六百二十亿日元（合二十六亿七千多万美元）以上，打破了战后日本预算的纪录。
    吉田政府的预算草案是根据重新军国主义化政策拟订的，为直接军费和驻日美军的维持费拨出了两千多亿日元的巨款，包括所谓“防御”费用一千四百五十亿日元——“保安厅”经费八百三十亿日元和变相的“占领费”六百二十亿日元。在这种情况下，自从一九四九年度以来根据美国底特律银行家、新任艾森豪威尔政府预算局局长道奇的指令强制维持平衡的日本财政收支，现在开始露出破绽。吉田政府在新预算草案中第一次建议用发行所谓“捐税储蓄公债”的办法“借款”三百亿日元，来平衡日本的预算。不仅如此，据国际新闻社东京消息，“财政专家们指出，在新预算案中的通货膨胀的因素，并不仅是建议要发行的三百亿日元‘捐税储蓄公债’，而还有允许国营铁道公司及电气通讯公司发行总数达二百二十亿日元的债券这一政策决议。”这些“财政专家们”怀疑公众会热心购买这些债券，“而这样就会因印刷钞票而导致通货膨胀”。这意味着吉田政府打算在新的会计年度中，在苛捐杂税之外还要直接或间接向人民大众强制“借款”五百二十亿日元。
    吉田政府的新预算草案引起了普遍的忧虑和反对。金融界和反对党都担忧庞大的预算将引起通货膨胀，反对党并纷纷表示要求修改预算草案。
