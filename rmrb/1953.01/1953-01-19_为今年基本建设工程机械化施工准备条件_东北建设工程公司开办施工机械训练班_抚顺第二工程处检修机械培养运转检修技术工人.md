To prepare conditions for mechanized construction of basic construction projects this year:

The Northeast Construction Engineering Company Opens Construction Machinery Training Class

Fushun No. 2 Engineering Department Overhauls Machinery and Trains Operation and Maintenance Technicians

The Northeast Industrial Department's Construction Engineering Company has opened a construction machinery training class to train technical personnel to operate various construction machinery and equipment.

This year, the company's major construction sites will add a large number of construction machinery and equipment. In order to train technical personnel to operate the machinery and equipment and ensure that these machines are effectively put into operation, the company selected 250 outstanding apprentices from basic construction workers, recruited 77 outstanding Youth League members from rural areas, plus 36 apprentices, 31 technicians, and 22 technicians dispatched by the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, totaling 416 people, to form the construction machinery training class.

The training class curriculum is divided into two parts: political and technical. Political study has now begun, mainly focusing on class education and patriotic education. The second step is technical education, which is divided into two categories: electric prime movers and internal combustion prime movers. Initial general education is followed by specialized education based on each individual's conditions, with emphasis on earthwork construction machinery and cranes as specialized courses. The training period is four months. It is required that each student, after completing various technical courses, can understand the principles of two different construction machines, be able to independently and skillfully operate one machine, and be able to use another machine.

Furthermore: The Fushun No. 2 Engineering Department is vigorously carrying out machinery and equipment overhaul work and actively training mechanical operation and maintenance technicians to prepare conditions for mechanized construction this year.

Last year, the department implemented mechanized construction on some projects, but due to inadequate preparation, the average mechanical utilization rate of the entire department was only 50%. Concrete mixers only completed 12.5% of the department's total concrete work.

This year, with the increase in basic construction tasks, the scope of mechanized construction will be expanded. In order to ensure the smooth progress of mechanized construction this year, the department has been working on preparations since mid-November last year.

The department first expanded the original machinery team into a machinery repair shop, transferred a group of machinery repair personnel, technicians, and management personnel from various engineering teams, and selected a group of active veteran workers to serve as team leaders. In addition, many repair tools and lathes were added. After the personnel were fully equipped, the machinery overhaul work was carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

In order to train technical workers to operate machinery, in addition to training machinery operation workers through construction machinery training classes, the department also organized a group of apprentices to participate in maintenance, with veteran technicians responsible for training them in practical work through the apprenticeship method.

In order to strengthen machinery management, the department, in conjunction with machinery overhaul, mobilized workers to discuss and formulate machinery maintenance systems and operating procedures; and stored a large number of tools, such as wrenches, pliers, oil cans, etc., which were placed in toolboxes and fixed to specific machines according to numbering. In addition, a large number of parts are also prepared and stored on mobile repair vehicles to ensure that repairs can be carried out at any time. In order to make machinery maintenance a mass and regular task, a "machinery file bag" was also set up during the maintenance, indicating the mechanical performance and other information. In this way, even if the machinery is transferred to other construction sites, the person operating the machinery can be clear about the situation, which is convenient for management.

    为今年基本建设工程机械化施工准备条件
    东北建设工程公司开办施工机械训练班
    抚顺第二工程处检修机械培养运转检修技术工人
    东北工业部建设工程公司开办施工机械训练班，培养操纵各种施工机械设备的技术人才。
    今年，该公司各主要工地将增添大量的施工机械设备。为了培养操纵机械设备的技术人才，保证把这些机械都有效地开动起来，该公司从基本建设工人中挑选了二百五十名优秀徒工，从农村中招收了七十七名优秀的青年团员，加上中央重工业部调派去的三十六名徒工、三十一名技术工人、二十二名技术员，一共四百一十六人，组成了施工机械训练班。
    训练班教学内容分为政治与技术两部分。现在已开始政治学习，主要是进行阶级教育和爱国主义教育。第二步是技术教育，内容分为电动原动机和内燃原动机两大类。初期进行普通教育，然后根据每个人的条件着重进行专业教育。确定以土方施工机械和起重机为专门课程。训练时间为四个月。要求每个学员学完各种技术课程以后，能够懂得两种不同施工机械的原理，并能单独熟练地操纵一种机械，兼会使用其它一种机械。
    又讯：抚顺第二工程处大力进行机械设备检修工作，积极培养机械运转、检修等技术工人，为今年机械化施工准备条件。
    去年，该处在部分工程上实行了机械化施工，但由于准备工作没有做好，全处的机械使用率平均只达百分之五十。混凝土搅拌机仅完成全处混凝土工程量的百分之十二点五。
    今年，随着基本建设任务的增加，机械化施工的范围将要扩大。该处为保证今年机械化施工的顺利进行，从去年十一月中起，即着手进行准备工作。
    该处首先把原来的机械班，扩大为机械修配车间，从各工程队抽调了一批机械修配人员、技术人员和管理人员，并选拔了一批工作积极的老工人担任组长。另外并增添了许多检修工具、车床等。人员配备齐全后，即开始有计划、有步骤地进行机械检修工作。
    为了培养操纵机械的技术工人，该处除通过施工机械训练班训练机械运转工人外，并组织一批徒工参加检修，由老技术工人分工负责用带徒弟的办法，在实际工作中进行培养。
    为了加强机械管理工作，该处结合检修机械，发动工人讨论、制订了机械保养制度和操作规程；并储备了大量工具，如搬子、钳子、油壶等，装在工具箱内，按编号固定在特定机械上。另外还准备制造、储备大批零件，装在流动修理车上，以保证随时可以进行修理工作。为了使机械检修、保养成为群众性的经常性的工作，在检修中还设立了“机械文件袋”，注明机械性能等情况。这样，即或将机械转移到其它工地，也可使操纵机械的人心中有数，便于管理。
