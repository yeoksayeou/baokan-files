Fushun City Construction Company, during its winter training for construction workers, enhanced workers' awareness through class education via grievance meetings.

At the beginning of the winter training, study discipline in the training classes was poor, and many workers did not have a correct understanding of learning. In response to this situation, the training classes focused on conducting class education for the workers. The first lesson was on class struggle; the second lesson summarized the learning of this stage, initiated criticism and self-criticism, and stimulated enthusiasm for learning; the third lesson further conducted class education, holding a grievance meeting for more than two hundred workers. Through typical grievance statements and group discussions, contrasting the new and old societies, the class awareness of the workers was enlightened.

Construction workers suffered deep oppression and exploitation in the old society. Sixty percent of the workers in the class were of peasant origin and accused landlords of persecution; thirty percent of the workers accused imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gangs of crimes. Many workers recounted their sufferings with tears in their eyes. For example, bricklayer Zhou Huansheng said, "In the old society, I was a child from a poor family and was constantly beaten and scolded by the children of landlords. Once, my mother went to the landlord Li Huafang's house to reason with him, and the landlord beat her to the point of death. My mother was pregnant at the time, and she fell ill for three days and died upon returning home." Carpenter Xin Yueliang said painfully, "I suffered too much in the past. The Japanese devils occupied my hometown, and my family could no longer survive. At that time, we thought we could find work outside the customs, but who would have thought that the Japanese devils would drag us to Dong'an to work in the coal mines, giving us only squash and potatoes to eat every day. My father, wife, and children all starved to death. Only my younger brother and I were left in the family. We couldn't get enough to eat and still had to work, and we were about to starve to death. Thanks to the Communist Party, we were liberated. Now, construction workers have become the masters of the country, and I have also started a family and have children. Life is getting better year by year."

After listening to the typical grievance statements, each worker recalled their own past sufferings. During group discussions, they expressed their determination to devote all their strength to building the motherland.

After the grievance meetings, all workers generally recognized the different status of workers in the new and old societies; they knew for whom the working class was laboring and the important task of construction workers in the country's industrialization. During the discussions, ninety percent of the workers actively spoke, and most of the workers expressed their inner thoughts. Study discipline has also been strengthened. For more than twenty days, the attendance rate has remained above ninety-seven percent.

    抚顺市建筑公司冬训中重视阶级教育
    抚顺市建筑公司在建筑工人冬季训练中，通过诉苦大会进行阶级教育，提高了工人的觉悟。
    冬季训练开始时，训练班的学习纪律很不好，很多工人对学习没有正确认识。针对这一情况，训练班着重向工人进行了阶级教育。第一课是讲阶级斗争；第二课总结了这一阶段学习，展开批评和自我批评，启发了学习热情；第三课便进一步进行阶级教育，召开了二百多名工人的诉苦大会，通过典型诉苦和小组讨论，以新旧社会对比，启发工人的阶级觉悟。
    建筑工人在旧社会里是深受压迫和剥削的，全班百分之六十农民出身的工人，控诉了受地主迫害的情形；百分之三十的工人控诉了帝国主义和国民党匪帮的罪行。很多工人一句一泪地诉说自己的苦处。如瓦工周焕生说：“在旧社会，我是穷人家的孩子，成天受地主家孩子的打骂。有一次母亲上地主李华方家去讲理，被地主打的死去活来，当时母亲正在怀孕，回来病了三天就死了。”木工辛月亮沉痛地说：“我过去受的苦太多了。日本鬼子占领了我的家乡，一家人实在活不下去啦，当时以为到关外还可以找活路，谁想日本鬼子把我们拉到东安去下煤洞子，一天只给点倭瓜和土豆吃，父亲、老婆和孩子都饿死了，一家人只剩了我和弟弟，一天吃不饱饭还得干活，眼瞅着也要饿死了。多亏共产党解放了我们，现在，建筑工人成了国家的主人，我也成了家啦，有了小孩啦，生活一年比一年好。”
    听了典型诉苦，每个工人都回想了自己过去的苦处，在小组讨论会上，纷纷表示了决心，要拿出所有力量来建设祖国。
    经过诉苦之后，全班工人普遍认识到新旧社会工人的不同地位；知道了工人阶级为谁劳动和建筑工人在国家工业化当中的重大任务。在讨论时，百分之九十的工人都积极发言，多数工人说出了心里话。学习纪律也加强了，二十多天以来，出勤率一直在百分之九十七以上。
