Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: The "New York Times" published an editorial on the 9th entitled "Using Asian Armies," attempting to deceive the Asian people by portraying Eisenhower's policy of "using Asians to fight Asians" as "enabling Asians to defend themselves and protect their rights." The "New York Times" believes that if the South Korean puppet army of Syngman Rhee, the Vietnamese puppet army of Bao Dai, the Philippine army, and the Kuomintang bandit troops are armed and used under such a line of reasoning, then "no one will say that we are engaging in conspiracies, that we are selfish, or that we are 'imperialists'." The "New York Times" shamelessly boasted that this is a "very good strategy."

However, this sophistry of the "New York Times" cannot deceive the Asian people. The Asian people clearly know that it is none other than the American aggressors who are infringing upon their national independence and democratic freedom. The American aggressors are extensively establishing military bases in Asia, using dollars and arms to support reactionary regimes in Asia, intensifying the enslavement of the Asian people, and driving the Asian people to serve as cannon fodder for American aggressive wars. The "Christian Science Monitor" revealed on January 2nd that Eisenhower, Dulles, and their ilk were planning to use the Kuomintang bandit troops and openly stated: "When General Eisenhower and Dulles talked about possibly using Chiang and his troops, they themselves knew that they were regarding Chiang Kai-shek as a useful tool for their own policies..." In the face of all these facts, the deceptive arguments of the "New York Times" are worthless.

In fact, the real purpose of Eisenhower's policy of "using Asians to fight Asians" has long been no secret. The United States has suffered significant casualties in the war of aggression against Korea, and the American people are increasingly opposed to this war. US Republican Senator Watkins recently admitted that if the Korean War continues for a few more years "with US troops maintaining the current situation," then "the majority of the American people will certainly not agree with such a prospect." Moreover, because it is impossible to win this war, one-third of the US Army and one-quarter of the Air Force are tied down on the small Korean battlefield, making it impossible for the American aggressors to launch new large-scale aggressions in other regions. Eisenhower's policy of "using Asians to fight Asians" is intended to find scapegoats for the US military, thereby easing the dissatisfaction of the American people and preventing the bankruptcy of the global aggression plan. The US House of Representatives Military Subcommittee, in a report released on December 30th last year, called for greater use of Asians to fight. This report believes that US troops should not be "in the front line" in the Korean War. Washington columnist Allen recently reported Eisenhower's "new concept" regarding the Korean War, saying that Eisenhower's main goal is to withdraw US troops from Korea and place them in a position to become a powerful and mobile reserve force.

It is quite obvious that Eisenhower's policy of "using Asians to fight Asians" is to use Asians to "block the front line" for the US military, in order to reduce US military casualties in the war of aggression against Korea, and to enable the US military to carry out new aggressions in the vast areas of the Far East. This is the real purpose of the conspiracy carried out by the selfish American imperialists. The "New York Times'" nervous self-defense proves that the American aggressors are very afraid that this unseemly conspiracy will be shamefully bankrupt under the strong opposition of the Asian people.

### 艾森豪威尔“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋遭到普遍反对  “纽约时报”花言巧语仍图欺骗亚洲人民

    艾森豪威尔“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋遭到普遍反对
    “纽约时报”花言巧语仍图欺骗亚洲人民
    【新华社十五日讯】“纽约时报”在九日发表了一篇题为“使用亚洲军队”的社论，企图欺骗亚洲人民，把艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，说成是“为了使亚洲人能够进行自卫并保卫他们的权利”。“纽约时报”认为，如果在这样一种论调下武装和使用南朝鲜的李承晚伪军、越南的保大伪军、菲律宾军队和国民党匪军，那么“将没有人说我们是进行阴谋活动，说我们是自私的，说我们是‘帝国主义者’”。“纽约时报”无耻地吹嘘说，这是一种“非常好的战略”。
    可是“纽约时报”这种花言巧语是骗不了亚洲人民的。亚洲人民清楚地知道，侵犯他们的民族独立和民主自由的权利的不是别人，正是美国侵略者。美国侵略者在亚洲广泛建立军事基地，用美元和军火来支持亚洲的反动政权，加紧奴役亚洲人民，驱使亚洲人民充当美国进行侵略战争的炮灰。美国“基督教科学箴言报”一月二日在透露艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯一伙人正计划使用国民党匪军时，即公开地说：“当艾将军和杜勒斯谈到可能起用蒋及其军队时，他们自己知道，他们是把蒋介石看为他们自己的政策的有用工具……”在这一切事实面前，“纽约时报”的欺骗论调就一文不值了。
    事实上，艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策的真正目的，早已不是什么秘密了。美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中遭到了重大的伤亡，美国人民已经越来越反对这个战争。美国共和党参议员华金斯最近承认，朝鲜战争如果“在美国出兵维持目前这种局面的情况下”再打几年，那么“美国人民大多数一定不会赞同这样一种前途”。而且由于无法打赢这个战争，美国陆军的三分之一和空军的四分之一，被牵制住在小小的朝鲜战场上，使美国侵略者无法在其他地区发动新的大规模侵略。艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，就是为了给美国军队找替死鬼，借以缓和美国人民的不满，并避免全球侵略计划的破产。美国众议院军事小组委员会在去年十二月三十日公布的报告中，要求多利用亚洲人来打仗。这个报告认为，美国军队不应该在朝鲜战争中“挡头阵”。华盛顿的专栏作家艾伦最近报道艾森豪威尔关于朝鲜战争的“新观念”说，艾森豪威尔的主要目标是要从朝鲜抽调美国军队，把他们安置在足以成为强大而机动的后备军的位置上去。
    十分明显，艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，就是要用亚洲人来给美国军队“挡头阵”，以减少美国军队在侵朝战争中的伤亡，并使美国军队能够在远东广大地区进行新的侵略。这就是自私的美帝国主义者所进行的阴谋活动的真正目的。“纽约时报”心虚的自我辩护论调，证明美国侵略者十分害怕它这个见不得人的阴谋将在亚洲人民的强烈反对下遭到可耻的破产。
