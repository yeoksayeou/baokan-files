Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Soviet Union has invented many new and highly efficient agricultural machines and precision instruments, further improving the level of agricultural mechanization and agricultural technology. According to TASS, the Soviet Union is mass-producing an interesting new machine attached to an ordinary grain seeder, which can sow seeds, evenly cover them, and level the ground all at the same time. Experience has shown that seeds sown in this way can accelerate germination and seedling emergence, as well as accelerate maturity and increase yield. This machine can also dig ditches for irrigation while sowing.

The successful design of many new types of combine harvesters has further improved the efficiency of harvesting work. The Rostov Agricultural Machinery Factory is mass-producing the newly designed "Stalin-8" grain combine harvester. This machine is one and a half times more efficient than the currently used "Stalin-6" combine harvester, and the quality of work is very high. The factory has also designed two types of crawler self-propelled combine harvesters, which have been proven by experiments to be able to perform harvesting work on low and wet soils. Machine manufacturers in the Ukrainian Republic have manufactured a sugar beet loader that can fill a three-ton (6,000 market catties) truck with sugar beets in six minutes. In addition, the Soviet Union is also using a state-of-the-art mower that requires only one person to operate and can continuously complete mowing, stacking, and transporting grass. This machine improves the efficiency of forage supply work.

Soviet scientists are working hard to automate and mechanize irrigation technology, and an electric sprinkler and many types of high-efficiency sprinklers have been designed. Soviet scientists have also invented a machine that irrigates between ridges and long strips of land by allowing water to flow freely over the ground, irrigating more than 20 hectares (15 mu per hectare) in eight hours.

The Soviet Union has newly manufactured some machines that can mechanize troublesome tasks. Ukrainians have manufactured a new type of grain ventilator, which can ventilate and dissipate heat for more than 500 tons (more than one million market catties) of grain per shift without moving it.

Soviet scientists have newly designed many precision instruments. One of them is called a "salinity meter," which allows every collective farmer to use this small instrument to measure the salt content of the soil in the field in half an hour. In the past, taking soil samples to the laboratory to determine the salt content took one or two days to get results. In addition, there are various new types of instruments designed to determine the moisture content of grain, measure the acidity of the soil, automatically control the depth of plowing, and measure the area of cultivated land. The characteristic of all these instruments is that they are easy to carry and highly effective when used in the field.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. According to TASS, the Soviet Union currently manufactures more than 200 different types of agricultural machines, which is two and a half times the number of types of agricultural machines manufactured in 1940. Alexander Moiseyev, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing, recently told TASS reporters: Some of these machines are newly designed, and some have been greatly improved after the war. They include various combine harvesters for harvesting grain, cotton, flax, sugar beets, potatoes, and pasture, as well as grain and pasture seeders. The Soviet Union has manufactured many complex tree planters that mechanize the large-scale planting of protective forest belts, and versatile equipment for excavating temporary irrigation canals in newly irrigated areas, and many machines that mechanize the laborious operations of animal husbandry. At present, the degree of mechanization of hay cutting and feed conservation in collective farms has increased to three times that before the war.

Moiseyev pointed out that the characteristic of the Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing industry is that it has a close relationship with agricultural biology, and the latest achievements in science are reflected in the design of many new machines. For example, in order to meet the needs of advanced agricultural technology methods, a special seeder for sowing grain in narrow rows has been designed. This machine can increase the yield per unit area by 15 to 20 percent. A square cluster seeder for planting crops that require inter-row cultivation greatly reduces the amount of labor required for cultivation. In the post-war years, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants have manufactured more than five million various types of machines and tools. At present, the output of combine harvesters is five and a half times that before the war, and the output of tractor-drawn cultivators is three times that before the war. The following figures show the scale of Soviet agricultural machinery production: a heavy-duty tractor-drawn plow can be manufactured every four minutes, and a tractor-drawn seeder can be manufactured every five minutes.

Moiseyev said that agricultural machinery manufacturing plants are equipped with the latest machines. The laborious work in the sand casting workshop has been mechanized, and automatic production equipment has been adopted on a large scale in the forging and die-casting departments.

Moiseyev finally said that the workers of the agricultural machinery manufacturing plants are successfully producing new machines, which will help collective farms and state farms to complete the task of comprehensively mechanizing the most laborious labor in agriculture as stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    农业机械化和农业技术水平进一步提高的标志
    苏联发明许多农业新机器和仪器
    莫伊谢耶夫谈苏联农业机器的高度水平
    【新华社十六日讯】苏联又发明了许多高效率的农业新机器和精密的新仪器，使农业机械化和农业技术的水平进一步提高。据塔斯社消息：苏联已在大批制造一种新发明的有趣的机器，这种机器安装在一台普通的谷物播种机上，可以一面播种，一面把种子均匀地盖好，同时把地面弄平。经验证明，这样播下的种子可以加速发芽成苗，而且可以加速成熟并提高产量。这种机器在进行播种工作的同时，还可挖出一条条的水沟以便灌溉。
    许多新式的收割联合机的设计成功，已使收获工作的效率提得更高。罗斯多夫农业机器制造厂正在大量生产新设计的“斯大林—八式”谷物收割联合机。这种机器的效率是目前使用的“斯大林—六式”收割联合机的一倍半，而且工作的质量很高。该厂还设计了两种爬行自动推进收割联合机，实验证明它们可以在低湿土壤上从事收割工作。乌克兰共和国的机器制造者制造了一种甜菜装填机，能在六分钟内把载重三吨（合六千市斤）的卡车装满甜菜。此外，苏联还使用了一种最新式的刈草机，它只需要一个人操使，可以连续完成刈草、堆草和运草等工作。这种机器提高了饲料供应工作的效率。
    苏联科学家正在努力使灌溉技术自动化和机械化，一种电气洒水机以及许多种高效率的洒水机已设计出来。苏联科学家还发明了一种在田畦间和长幅土地上使水在地面上自流进行灌溉的机器，每台在八小时内可以灌溉二十多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。
    苏联新制造了一些可以使麻烦的工作机械化的机器。乌克兰人制造了一种新式的谷物通风器，这种机器可以在每一工作班内使五百多吨（合一百多万市斤）谷物不必移动而通风散热。
    苏联科学家新设计了许多精密仪器。其中一种名叫“测盐计”，每个集体农民都可以用这个小小的仪器到田间在半小时内测定土壤所含的盐分。而过去把土壤标本拿到实验室测定盐分，却要一两天的时间才有结果。此外还有确定谷物所含湿度、测定土壤所含酸度、自动控制耕犁深度和测定耕地面积等各种新式的仪器设计出来。所有这些仪器的特色都便于携带和在田间应用时效能很高。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联目前制造的不同类型的农业机器有二百多种，为一九四○年制造的农业机器类型的两倍半。苏联农业机器制造部副部长亚历山大·莫伊谢耶夫最近接见塔斯社记者说：这些机器有些是新设计的，有些是战后大大改良过的，里面包括收获谷物、棉花、亚麻、甜菜、马铃薯、牧草等各种收割联合机以及谷物和牧草播种机。苏联制造了许多使大规模植造防护林带工作机械化的复杂的植树机，和在新灌溉区开凿临时灌溉渠的万能设备，并且制造许多使饲畜业的费力操作机械化的机器。现在，各集体农庄刈割干草和保藏饲料工作的机械化程度已经提高到战前的三倍多。
    莫伊谢耶夫指出，苏联农业机器制造业的特点是它和农业生物学有着密切的联系，科学方面最新的成就表现在许多新机器的设计上。例如，为了适应先进的农业技术方法的需要，已设计了一种在窄行中播种谷物的特种播种机。这种机器可使单位面积产量增加百分之十五到二十。一种种植需要中耕的作物的方形簇种机把耕耘所需的劳动数量大大减少。在战后年代中，各农业机器制造厂已制造了五百多万台各式各样的机器和工具。现在收割联合机的产量已为战前的五倍半，拖拉机曳引中耕机的产量已为战前的三倍。从下面的数字可以看出苏联农业机器生产的规模：每四分钟可以制造出一个重型拖拉机曳引犁，每五分钟可以制造出一台拖拉机曳引播种机。
    莫伊谢耶夫说：农业机器制造厂是以最新式的机器装备起来的。翻砂间的费力工作已经机械化，在锻冶和压型部门已经大规模采用自动生产装置。
    莫伊谢耶夫最后说，各农业机器制造厂的工人正在顺利生产新机器，这些新机器将帮助集体农庄和国营农场完成第五个五年计划规定的使农业中最费力的劳动全面机械化的任务。
