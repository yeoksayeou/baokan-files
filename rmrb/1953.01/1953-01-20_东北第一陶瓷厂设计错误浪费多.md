The newly constructed Northeast China Building Materials Industry Bureau's First Ceramics Factory has suffered from long-term irrationalities and caused significant waste to the nation due to serious errors and shortcomings in its design work. This is the result of the Bureau's leadership cadres' eagerness for quick success, their lack of economic accounting perspective, and their failure to understand the importance and complexity of design work. It is also the result of the designers of the project failing to eliminate the influence of bourgeois design thinking and lacking a sense of responsibility towards national basic construction. The Northeast Industrial Department has conducted a strict inspection of this design work and is using this case to educate cadres and technical personnel.

The construction project of the Northeast China First Ceramics Factory began planning in 1949, and the official design and construction began in 1950, with the entire project scheduled to be completed and put into production in 1952. However, as of the end of 1952, the entire project plan had not been completed, and many errors were found in the factory's design. The main problems are reflected in the following aspects:

First, the entire design work lacked careful planning and overall design in advance. The First Ceramics Factory is a considerably large factory, but the leading cadres of the Bureau adopted a hasty approach to the construction of such a large factory, building the factory while simultaneously experimenting. The design was not reviewed after completion. For example, the design of the gas generator was not completed for a long time. In order to rush the construction, they rashly entrusted the entire design and production of the gas generator to the private Minsheng Processing Factory to imitate the design of the First Glass Factory's gas generator without considering the overall situation. After the Minsheng Processing Factory stopped designing the gas generator pipeline drawings for some reason, the Bureau, in order to "catch up with the task," simply abandoned the drawings and started piecing things together on site. More seriously, the leading cadres of the Bureau initially believed that ceramic machinery was relatively "simple," so they did not consider the weakness in mechanical design capabilities and the lack of experience. They allowed the mechanical and civil engineering designs to proceed simultaneously without doing an overall design. In addition, the two parts of the work rarely communicated on weekdays, resulting in the mechanical installation design lagging far behind the civil engineering design. The civil engineering had already been designed, but the mechanical part could not come up with specific plans, which caused many serious errors. Some mechanical equipment even had to be changed to accommodate the completed factory buildings. For example, the factory building for the circular crushing yard was built first, but when the stone roller mill was installed, it was found that the factory building was too low, so the feeding machine had to be shortened. The circular crushing yard was originally designed to use a belt conveyor for feeding, but when construction started, it was found that the factory building was too high and the slope was too steep, so it had to be temporarily changed to a rotary belt conveyor, which reduced the transport capacity compared to the original design. Conversely, some projects had to have parts of the already built factory buildings torn down to accommodate the installation of machinery. For example, the gas generator and boiler were installed only after parts of the factory buildings were torn down.

Second, the designers were irresponsible, and the design technology was backward. For example, without careful surveying and testing, the designers arbitrarily set the soil's bearing capacity at eight tons per square meter, and then soon raised it to fifteen tons, equally without any basis. The safety factor of the factory's buildings was determined arbitrarily based on such "imagination" and "estimation." Experts estimated that the pillars of the main factory building could be used for as long as five hundred years. Furthermore, the factory building of the crushing yard should have been designed as a rectangular, single-row type, but the designers, in order to show off their "skills," designed it as a circular clock type. As a result, the transmission system was made very complicated (e.g., if it were designed as a single row, only one lineshaft would be needed to drive the machines; now four lineshafts are needed, plus belts, V-belts, gears, and other transmission equipment to drive the machines), the transportation method was unreasonable (easy to mix with other raw materials, undermining the principle of strict material proportioning that ceramics must adhere to), and the equipment was crowded, hindering workers' operations. At the same time, these buildings were not arranged according to the production process, making it difficult to implement assembly line operations after the start of operations. Many places required manual handling, increasing construction costs and transportation costs, creating long-term unreasonable conditions in production. For example, the circular crushing yard mentioned above was located in a separate place. After crushing, the raw materials had to be transported by car to the storage warehouse and then sent to the ball mill for grinding. If these two buildings were close together, transmission equipment could be used to implement assembly line operations, saving both handling labor and avoiding the raw materials getting dirty when transported outdoors. Another example is that the forming factory buildings were placed on both sides of the main factory building, which also made transportation very inconvenient.

Third, the designers simply pursued formal aesthetics, did not seek practical results, and did not pay attention to economic accounting. In addition to the huge waste caused by not complying with basic construction procedures, not doing overall design, being irresponsible, and backward design technology, as mentioned above, there are many such examples. For example, nearly 350 square meters of offices and platforms were built on the upper floor of the main factory building; purely for "aesthetics," the entrances to the main factory building and laboratory were designed as polygonal shapes, which wasted both materials and labor; a row of platforms was built outside each dormitory, which had no practical value and wasted building area for nothing.

Fourth, the design did not pay attention to workers' working conditions, safety, and welfare. For example, the workers' hospital was built in front of the main factory building where dust was flying and noise was excessive; the gas generator was built near the main work factory building. These are all extremely unreasonable designs that affect workers' health.

    东北第一陶瓷厂设计错误浪费多
    【本报讯】东北建筑材料工业管理局第一陶瓷厂的新建工程，由于设计工作中的严重错误和缺点，使工厂的很多部分长期陷于不合理状态，给国家造成了很大的浪费。这是该局领导干部急于求成，没有经济核算观点，不了解设计工作的重要性和复杂性的结果，也是该项工程的设计者没有排除资产阶级设计思想影响，对国家基本建设缺乏责任心的结果。东北工业部对于这一设计工作做了严格的检查，并运用这一事例对干部与技术人员进行教育。
    东北第一陶瓷厂的修建工程于一九四九年开始筹划，一九五○年正式设计施工，预定一九五二年全部竣工生产。但截至一九五二年年底，全部工程计划并未完成，而且发现工厂设计中有许多错误，主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、整个设计工作事前不作周密的计划，不作总体设计。第一陶瓷厂是一个规模相当宏大的工厂，但该局领导干部对这样一个大厂的建设工作，却采取了一面试验、一面建厂的草率态度。设计完成之后又不加审查。例如煤气发生炉的设计，做了很久没有做出来，为了急于施工，竟毫不从全局考虑，轻率地全部委托私营民生加工厂仿照第一玻璃厂的煤气发生炉设计制作。在民生加工厂因某种原因停止了煤气发生炉管道图的设计后，该局为了“赶任务”，索性不要图纸，在现场东拼西凑地干了起来。更严重的是，该局的领导干部一开始就认为陶瓷机械比较“简单”，因此没有考虑到机械方面的设计能力薄弱和经验不足，便在没有做总体设计的情况下，让机械与土木建筑设计同时并进。再加上这两部分工作平日很少联系，结果机械安装设计大大落后在土木建筑工程设计之后，土木建筑方面已经设计到的工程，机械部分还提不出具体的方案，因而造成了很多严重的错误。甚至不得不改变部分机械设备去迁就已落成的厂房。如圆形粉碎场的厂房先造好了，安石碾粉碎机时发现厂房低了，只得把下料机截短了一段。圆形粉碎场原设计用皮带输送机加料，但到施工时发现厂房太高，坡度太大，不得不临时改为旋转皮带运输机，使运输能力比原设计降低了。与此相反，有些工程又不得不将已经造成的厂房拆掉一部分，以适合机械的安装。如煤气发生炉和锅炉就都是在拆掉了厂房的一部分后才装上的。
    二、设计人员不负责任，设计技术落后。例如设计人员不经过精细的勘测与试验，就毫无根据地将土壤的耐压力定为每平方公尺八吨，不久又同样毫无根据地提高到十五吨。该厂建筑物的安全系数就是根据这种“假想”和“估计”，随意决定的。主要厂房的柱子经过专家的估计竟可以用五百年。再如粉碎场的厂房本来应该设计成长方形的一列式的，但是设计人员为了显一显“身手”，给设计成了圆形时钟式的。结果把传动系统弄得很复杂（如设计为一列式，只需一根天轴带动机器；现在得用四根天轴，还要加上皮带、三角皮带、齿轮等传动设备，才能带动机器），输送方式不合理（易于搀杂其他原料，破坏陶瓷必须严格配料的原则），而且设备拥挤，妨碍工人操作。同时，这些建筑没有按照生产过程排列，使得开工后不易实行流水作业，很多地方要用人力搬运，增加建筑费用与运输费用，造成了生产上的长期不合理的状态。如上述的圆形粉碎场独设一处，粉碎以后的原料要先用车推到贮藏库，再送到球磨机去磨。假如这两座建筑离得近，就可用传动设备，实行流水作业，既省了搬运人力，又可避免运送时经过露天把料弄脏。另如成型厂房分置在主要厂房的两边，也使得输送时很不方便。
    三、单纯追求形式美观，不求实效，不讲求经济核算。除上面所举的由于不遵守基本建设程序、不作总体设计、不负责任、设计技术落后等等所造成的巨大浪费外，还有许多这样的例子。例如在主要厂房楼上盖了将近三百五十平方公尺的办公室与平台；单纯为了“美观”，把主要厂房和试验室的入口处设计成多角形的，又费材料又费工；每栋宿舍外面修一排平台，没有什么实用价值，白白浪费了建筑面积。
    四、设计中不注意工人的劳动条件与安全福利。如把工人医院建筑在尘土飞扬、嘈杂异常的主要厂房前面；把煤气发生炉建筑在主要作业厂房近侧。这些都是影响工人健康，极不合理的设计。
