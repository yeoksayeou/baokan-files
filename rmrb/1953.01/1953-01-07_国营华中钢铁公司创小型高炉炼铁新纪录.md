    The No. XX small blast furnace of the state-owned Huazhong Iron and Steel Company set a new record for iron smelting in small blast furnaces for the ninth time on December 28th of last year. The daily output of the small blast furnace reached 292.44 percent of the furnace's designed capacity, and the effective volume of the blast furnace required to produce one ton of iron was reduced to 0.787 cubic meters, with the quality of the iron reaching 100 percent. This new record is a gift from all the staff and workers of the company's iron smelting workshop to the state for the large-scale construction that is beginning in 1953.

    国营华中钢铁公司创小型高炉炼铁新纪录
    国营华中钢铁公司某号小型高炉在去年十二月二十八日创造了第九次小型高炉炼铁新纪录。小型高炉的日产量达到该炉设计能力百分之二百九十二点四四，出一吨铁所需的高炉有效容积降低到零点七八七立方公尺，铁的质量达到百分之百。这次新纪录是该公司炼铁车间全体职工对国家开始大规模建设的一九五三年的献礼。    （新华社）
