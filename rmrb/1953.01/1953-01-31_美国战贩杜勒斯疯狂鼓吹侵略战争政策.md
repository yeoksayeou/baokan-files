Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: American Secretary of State Dulles delivered his first radio address on American foreign policy on the 27th. In this speech, Dulles clarified the basic concepts of American foreign policy, which is to intensify the aggressive war policies against peace, against democracy, and against national liberation everywhere in the world.

Dulles began by elaborating on the principles articulated by Eisenhower in his inaugural address, which were all for the benefit of American monopoly capital. He said, "President Eisenhower often likes to say the phrase 'enlightened self-interest'. This will be our guide in formulating foreign policy in the future."

Then, in order to conceal the aggressive and expansionist nature of American imperialist foreign policy, Dulles trotted out the Goebbels-esque propaganda about the "communist threat" and developed it further. He said that "Russian communists and their allies in other countries" are "conspiring to destroy us." He falsely accused the Soviet Union of implementing a so-called "policy of encirclement" against the United States, launching so-called "indirect aggression," and "already using violence."

But when Dulles attempted to offer some "factual" basis for these defamatory clichés, the imperialist content of his arguments was immediately exposed, and his ferocious aggressor's true colors were fully revealed.

Dulles emphatically pointed out that the so-called "threat" to the United States that he spoke of was primarily the fact that 800 million people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries had liberated themselves and built strong, independent nations. In addition, Dulles cited the liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people against French colonial rule and the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against American military aggression, "proving" that the Soviet Union "has already used violence." According to him, these "violent" actions were actions to "control Japan," which is to say, to "encircle the United States." He also listed the "hatred" of the people of the Middle Eastern countries toward American and British imperialism, the "rising up against Western European countries that still politically control most of Africa" of the African people, the "powerful communist movement" in Latin America against the "traditional" American domination, etc., as "indirect aggression" by the Soviet Union. Dulles here explained that what the American imperialists and he himself extremely hated and could not tolerate was the independence and liberation of all countries, including colonial dependencies.

Dulles spun this yarn in order to lead to the conclusion that it is justified for American imperialism to frantically expand its military, to conduct aggressive war preparations in all parts of the capitalist world, to bloodily invade Korea and frantically massacre peaceful Korean residents, to step up assistance to French colonialists in suppressing the Vietnamese people, and to use all insidious and despicable methods to undermine the interests of the people of all countries that have gained liberation from within. In outlining the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy for dealing with this fictitious "policy of encirclement," Dulles cited two points. The first point is: "We (the United States) must have a strong military establishment ourselves, and we must encourage our friends to build military strength"; moreover, he said that the purpose of this further establishment of "strength" is first and foremost to force the Chinese and Korean people and the Vietnamese people who are resolutely resisting imperialist aggression to "change their minds" and accept the conditions of enslavement by American imperialism. This exposes the American government's sinister conspiracy to intensify its arms race globally and expand its war of aggression in the Far East.

Dulles said that another "positive aspect" of the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy is to "cultivate a love and respect for freedom among other peoples." What "peoples" and what kind of "freedom"? Dulles indicated that it was the "freedom" of those who were "uneasy and unhappy" in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the People's Republic of China because of the trials and suppression of international spy organizations and counter-revolutionaries. He said that the United States would "do many things" to maintain these people's "love of freedom and independence." In order to keep these so-called "peoples" of American imperialism in other countries from despairing and becoming discouraged, Dulles emphatically announced that the American government has taken it upon itself to be the "backbone" of the reactionary forces around the world in opposing the surging people's revolutionary movements. He said to these "peoples": "You can rely on us."

However, the "grand" ambitions expressed by Dulles for American imperialism do not seem to be going smoothly in light of the facts. Even Dulles himself had to use the phrase "many troubles" to describe the situation of American imperialism in various parts of the world. Dulles admitted that aggression against Asia has a "very difficult" future. In the West, the "Western European unification" plan, which is the cornerstone of America's war preparation policy in Western Europe, has "somewhat stalled" because, despite American dictates, "some French and some Germans want to go their separate ways again."

While peddling an all-encompassing aggressive plan dictated by America's "self-interest," Dulles hypocritically professed that American imperialism has no intention of war, even quoting words from the Bible to swear: "All who draw the sword will die by the sword." However, Dulles's entire vicious speech, and America's actions in Korea, make these words sound like "Amitabha!" being chanted by a murderer with blood all over his hands!

### 美国战贩杜勒斯疯狂鼓吹侵略战争政策

    美国战贩杜勒斯疯狂鼓吹侵略战争政策
    【新华社三十日讯】美国新国务卿杜勒斯二十七日发表关于美国外交政策的第一次广播演说。在这篇演说里，杜勒斯阐明了美国对外政策的基本概念，就是要在全世界一切地方加紧推行反对和平、反对民主、反对民族解放的侵略战争政策。
    杜勒斯一开始就发挥了艾森豪威尔在就职演说里阐明了的一切为了美国垄断资本的利益的原则。他说：“艾森豪威尔总统常常喜欢说这样一句话‘为了开明的自身利益’。这将是我们今后拟订外交政策时的指针。”
    接着，为了掩饰美国的帝国主义外交政策的侵略和扩张的性质，杜勒斯就拿出戈培尔宣传关于“共产主义威胁”的滥调，并且加以发展。他说“俄国共产党人以及他们在其他国家内的同盟者”“正在阴谋毁灭我们”。他污蔑苏联正在对美国实行所谓
    “包围政策”，发动所谓“间接侵略”，并且“已经使用了暴力”。
    但是当杜勒斯企图替自己这些诽谤滥调提出一些
    “事实”根据时，他的论点的帝国主义的内容就立刻暴露出来了，他的狰狞的侵略者的原形就完全毕露了。
    杜勒斯着重地指出，他所说的对美国的所谓“威胁”首先就是这个事实：苏联和人民民主国家的八亿人民已经解放了自己并且建设起强大的独立国家。此外，杜勒斯举出越南人民反抗法国殖民统治的解放斗争和朝中人民抗击美国军事侵略的斗争，
    “证明”苏联“已经使用了暴力”。据他说，这些“暴力”行动是为了“控制日本”，也就是“包围美国”的行动。他还把中东国家人民对美英帝国主义的“仇恨”，非洲人民的“起来反对仍旧在政治上控制着非洲大部分的西欧国家”，拉丁美洲反对美国“传统”的统治关系的“强大的共产主义运动”等等，都列为苏联的“间接侵略”。杜勒斯在这里说明了美帝国主义者和他本人所极端仇视和不能容忍的，是包括殖民地附属国在内的一切国家人民的独立和解放。
    杜勒斯胡诌这一大通，就是为了要导引出一个结论，就是：美帝国主义疯狂扩张军备，在资本主义世界各地进行侵略战争准备，血腥地侵略朝鲜和疯狂地屠杀朝鲜和平居民，加紧帮助法国殖民者镇压越南人民，并且尽一切阴险卑鄙的方法来从内部破坏已获得解放的各国人民的利益，是正当的。他在概述艾森豪威尔政府的对付这个虚构的“包围政策”的外交政策时举出两点。第一点就是：“我们（美国）本身必须有强大的军事机构，我们必须鼓励我们的朋友建立军事实力”；而且，他说，这种进一步建立“实力”的行动的目的，首先和主要的就是要迫使坚决反抗帝国主义侵略的朝中人民以及越南人民“改变他们的想法”，接受美帝国主义的奴役条件。这就暴露了美国政府决心在全球加紧扩军备战和在远东扩大侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。
    杜勒斯说，艾森豪威尔政府外交政策的另一“积极的方面”是：“在其他人民中培养一种对自由的爱好和尊敬”。是什么“人民”和怎样的“自由”呢？杜勒斯表明，是那些在东欧人民民主国家和中华人民共和国中因为对国际间谍组织和反革命分子的审判和镇压而“不安的、不快乐的”人的“自由”。他说美国要“做许多事情”来保持这些人的
    “爱好自由和独立的心”。为了叫美帝国主义在其他国家的这些所谓“人民”不要绝望和灰心丧气，杜勒斯着重地宣布，美国政府自任为全世界反动力量在反对高涨的人民革命运动中的“中流砥柱”。他向这些“人民”说：“你们能够依靠我们。”
    但是，杜勒斯所表明的美帝国主义“宏大”的志愿，从事实情况看来，并不得心应手。甚至杜勒斯自己也不得不用“有许多麻烦”来形容美帝国主义在世界各地的处境。杜勒斯承认，侵略亚洲，前途是“十分艰巨”。在西方，作为美国在西欧的备战政策的基石的“西欧统一”计划又“有些陷于停顿”，因为，尽管美国发号施令，“有些法国人和有些德国人又要各走各的路”。
    杜勒斯在鼓吹美国“自身利益”所规定的无孔不入的侵略计划时，却伪善地表白美帝国主义决无战争之心，甚至引用圣经里的话来赌咒：“凡动刀的必死在刀下。”但是，杜勒斯的全篇恶狠狠的演说，和美国在朝鲜的行径，使得这话听起来就像一个满手血污的杀人犯嘴上念的“阿弥陀佛！”
