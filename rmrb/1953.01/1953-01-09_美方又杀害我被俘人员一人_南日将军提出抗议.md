    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. On January 6th, another of our captured personnel was beaten to death in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. According to the US side, the reason for the beating was that this prisoner "ran out of the barracks" and "approached the fence." This despicable excuse from the US side clearly cannot hide the reign of terror they are carrying out in the prisoner-of-war camp.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. On January 8th, General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, lodged a serious protest with the other side regarding the killing of another of our captured personnel by the US side in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp on January 6th, pointing out that the US side cannot escape full responsibility for the war crime of massacring prisoners of war. At approximately 4:15 PM and 4:30 PM on January 7th, US military aircraft violated the Korean armistice talks conference area agreement by intruding into the airspace above the Panmunjom conference area twice. Our chief liaison officer lodged a protest with the other side on January 8th, demanding that the other side take concrete and effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    美方又杀害我被俘人员一人
    南日将军提出抗议
    【新华社开城八日电】一月六日在巨济岛战俘营内又有一名我方战俘被打死。据美方宣布：打死的原因是这个战俘“从营房里跑出来”、“接近了围栅”。美方这种可耻的借口，显然掩盖不了其在战俘营内所施行的恐怖统治。
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在一月八日就一月六日美方在巨济岛战俘营中又打死我方被俘人员一人事向对方提出严重抗议，指出美方绝不能逃脱对于屠杀战俘的战争罪行的完全责任。一月七日下午四时十五分与四时三十分左右美方军用飞机又违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，两次侵入板门店会场区上空。我方首席联络官在一月八日向对方提出抗议，要求对方采取确实有效措施，使类似事件不再发生。
