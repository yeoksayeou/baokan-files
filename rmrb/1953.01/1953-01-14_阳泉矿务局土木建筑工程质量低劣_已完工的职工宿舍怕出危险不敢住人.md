The civil engineering construction undertaken by the Yangquan Mining Bureau in North China during 1952 suffered from numerous problems. In constructing employee dormitories, the bureau, eager to meet targets, not only caught up on the work backlog from the first half of the year but also hastily completed approximately 85% of the additional 20,000 square meters of construction during September, October, and November of 1952. This resulted in inferior construction quality, severely impacting the lifespan of the projects, and causing unnecessary losses to the state and the people. The completed dormitories are uninhabitable due to fear of danger. The head of the Bureau's Capital Construction Department stated: "The newly built dormitories are unbearable to look at (they are truly unsightly), cannot be compared (they are worse than any coal mine project), and are unsafe to live in (for fear of being crushed to death)."

Most of the newly built dormitories suffer from careless bricklaying, resulting in uneven walls, excessively large joints, and insufficient mortar. Bricks can be pulled out by hand in some walls; in others, protruding bricks can be aligned with a single tap. Many walls have eight or nine continuous joints. Partition walls and gable walls are not properly connected. The stones are laid inconsistently, pressure is uneven, the bedding is not level, the brick joints in the flat masonry are not straight, the ties are uneven, and the brick joints are messy. The plastering shrinks inwards and expands outwards, with widespread cracking. The foundations are poorly laid, and the foundation stones can be dislodged with a kick. The roofing is generally peeling, the tiles are uneven, the mud is insufficient, and the roofs leak when it rains. The ridges of the roofs exhibit a "hunchback" phenomenon. The roof of the Majiaping dormitory was already leaking during snowfall. The door and window materials are too small, and the wood is not dry, causing them to warp and become misaligned, rendering them inoperable. Approximately one-tenth of the doors and windows in Majiaping have already been destroyed by the wind. Furthermore, because the roof frames are all gable purlins, the purlins are of varying lengths and improperly positioned. In some cases, due to the purlins being too short, wooden shims have been inserted to protect the purlin ends. The partition wall doors do not have lintels, but purlins are added above, creating a rather dangerous situation. Most of the Bureau's projects require immediate repairs upon completion, and the situation is expected to worsen after the spring thaw.

Irresponsible behavior in engineering design is also prevalent. For example, the Bureau's two collective dormitories in Majiaping were constructed under high-voltage power lines without prior surveying, and work was forced to stop only after an electrocution accident occurred when workers were on the roof. Furthermore, the foundations for three dormitories in Majiaping were abandoned after construction began because they obstructed road construction, as no contact was made with the municipal construction department prior to design. Many workers' dormitories were designed without proper coal gas ventilation equipment. After workers moved into the new dormitories, gas poisoning incidents occurred frequently. According to statistics from the first three days after workers moved into the dormitories, four people were poisoned, one of whom died, and three were rescued.

The main reason for the above errors is the Yangquan Mining Bureau's leading cadres' neglect of capital construction and their bureaucratic style of indifference to the welfare of the workers. It is hoped that they will promptly conduct thorough inspections and quickly rectify these problems.

### 阳泉矿务局土木建筑工程质量低劣  已完工的职工宿舍怕出危险不敢住人

    阳泉矿务局土木建筑工程质量低劣
    已完工的职工宿舍怕出危险不敢住人
    华北阳泉矿务局一九五二年所修建的土木建筑工程中存在很多问题。该局在修建职工宿舍时，因急于完成任务，在一九五二年九、十、十一三个月中，不但把上半年未完成的工作量赶齐，并把追加的二万平方公尺的工程草率完成百分之八十五左右，致使工程质量低劣，严重影响了工程的寿命，给国家和人民造成不应有的损失；已完工的宿舍，则因怕出危险，不敢让工人去住。该局基本建设处处长说：“新建的宿舍不敢看（实在不像样）、不敢比（较任何煤矿的工程都糟）、不敢住（怕砸死人）。”
    该局新建宿舍大部因砌砖草率，以致墙面不平，灰缝太大，灰浆不足。有的墙上的砖可以用手抽出；有的墙因墙砖突出过多，可用棍拍齐；墙面八、九道对缝的很多；隔墙与山墙互不衔接。砌石卧立不一，压力不匀，铺底不平，平砌砖缝不直，打扎不一，砖缝是乱的。墙皮里缩外涨，普遍龟裂。基础打得不好，基石用脚一踢即可脱落。屋顶普遍爆皮，瓦顶不平，铺泥不足，下雨就漏。房脊则有驼腰现象。马家坪宿舍的房顶，在下雪时已发现滴水。门窗材料太小，木质不干，以致歪斜走形，不能开关。马家坪门窗现被风摧毁者已达十分之一左右。另外因房架都是硬山搁檩，檩条长短不一，安置不正；有的因檩条太短，竟插垫木护檩口；隔墙门上不用过木，上面加檩，情形相当危险。该局大部分的工程刚刚完工就需复修，估计春天解冻后情形将更形严重。
    在工程设计方面，不负责任现象也很严重。如该局马家坪的两栋集体宿舍，事前未作勘测，盲目地在高压线下施工，直到工人上顶时发生触电事故，才被迫停工。又如马家坪三栋宿舍的房基，因设计前没有和市政建设部门取得联系，动工后因有碍公路建设，只好停工作废。不少工人宿舍在设计时，没有注意排出煤气的设备，工人迁入新宿舍后，中毒事件不断发生，只据工人搬进宿舍三天内的统计，就有四人中毒，其中一人死亡，三人脱险。
    阳泉矿务局领导干部忽视基本建设，不关心职工福利的官僚主义作风，是造成上述错误的主要原因，希望他们及时深入检查，迅速纠正。
