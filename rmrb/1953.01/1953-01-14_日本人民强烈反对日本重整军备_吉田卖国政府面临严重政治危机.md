    Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: TASS, 12th Dispatch: News from Japan states that the Yoshida Cabinet is facing a serious political crisis, the fundamental reason for which is the increasing resistance of broad sections of the Japanese people to the American occupation and to the Yoshida government's traitorous policies.
    Recently, a wave of strikes has occurred throughout the country, and the majority of the Japanese people oppose Japanese rearmament and the establishment of a new Japanese army.
    Political observers emphasize that Japanese public opposition to rearmament is so strong that any political party that dares to propose a rearmament slogan or express support for American rearmament demands is bound to fail.
    The result of this mass pressure is that not only the opposition parties, but even some members of the Liberal Party led by Yoshida himself, have come out against the government. The Yoshida Cabinet is currently particularly concerned about the formulation of the 1953-1954 fiscal year budget, which will further increase so-called "defense expenditures."
    Currently, political and journalistic circles in Japan are discussing the possible resignation of the Yoshida government. Two things could cause the cabinet to collapse: the National Diet's discussion of the new budget and the House of Councillors election.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: Although the Yoshida government has always been reluctant to discuss rearmament due to fear of widespread opposition from the Japanese people, the facts show that the Yoshida government, with the active help of the American government, is rebuilding aggressive armed forces, plotting to plunge Japan into the abyss of war once again.
    A Kyodo News dispatch, in reviewing the Yoshida government's reconstruction in 1952 of the Japanese army and navy, which are prohibited by international agreements and the Japanese constitution, openly admitted that "the Japanese government took a step towards establishing a defense agency last year." "The new National Security Force and Maritime Safety Force have taken on more important military tasks than the previous Police Reserve Force and Maritime Safety Agency," and "they will become the core of the future army and navy."
    When the "Police Reserve Force" was reorganized into the "Security Force" on October 15 last year, its personnel had already expanded from 75,000, equivalent to four divisions, to 110,000, equivalent to five divisions. The Yoshida government calls this newly added division the "Area Force," stationed in Hokkaido, which is densely populated with American military bases. Kyodo News said that the establishment of the "Area Force" was "the first important step in strengthening the organization of the National Security Force." "The 'Area Force' has far greater power than the (original 'Police Reserve Force's') 'District Units', it is a mobile unit equipped with heavy weapons," "and in nature is equivalent to a task force equipped with heavy weapons." Currently, the "Area Force's" independent special tank battalion has sixty tanks, and its special infantry division includes several howitzer battalions, heavy mortar battalions, and machine gun battalions, and is equipped with anti-aircraft guns.
    Kyodo News also revealed that although this is the case, "the National Security Force has not yet been fully equipped. It is scheduled to be fully equipped by the end of this year." By then, a regular regiment will receive twenty-seven 57mm and twelve 75mm rocket launchers, twelve 60mm mortars, twenty-two Sherman tanks, and approximately three hundred various types of trucks. A special regiment, in addition to mortars with larger calibers, will have fifty-four 105mm howitzers (three battalions), eighteen 155mm howitzers (one battalion), sixty-four armored tractors equipped with anti-aircraft machine guns, and approximately five hundred and eighty various types of trucks.
    Currently, under the urging of the United States, the Yoshida government is planning to massively expand this "Security Force," preparing to use this army as capital for rebuilding Japanese militarist forces and as a source of cannon fodder for American aggression.

    日本人民强烈反对日本重整军备
    吉田卖国政府面临严重政治危机
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十二日讯：从日本来的消息说：吉田内阁正面临着严重的政治危机，其根本原因是广大阶层的日本人民对美国占领统治以及对吉田政府的卖国政策的反抗愈来愈强。
    最近，全国发生了罢工浪潮，大多数日本人民都反对日本重整军备，反对建立一支新的日本军队。
    政治观察家着重指出：日本公众对重整军备的反对是如此强烈，因此任何政党若胆敢提出重整军备的口号，或出来表示赞成美国的重整军备的要求，就定将招致失败。
    这种群众压力造成的结果是：不仅仅是各反对党派，甚至连吉田亲自领导的自由党的一部分党员也出来反对政府。吉田内阁目前特别感到棘手的事，就是拟订一九五三—一九五四会计年度的预算，该预算要进一步增加所谓“国防经费”。
    现在日本政界和报界都在讨论吉田政府可能辞职。有两件事可能使内阁垮台：国会对新预算的讨论以及参议院的选举。
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：尽管吉田政府由于害怕日本人民普遍的反对而始终讳言重整军备，但事实说明吉田政府正在美国政府的积极帮助之下重建侵略性的武装部队，阴谋把日本再度陷入战争的苦海深渊。
    共同社的一则消息在回顾一九五二年吉田政府重建为国际协议和日本宪法所禁止的日本陆、海军的情况时，公开承认：“日本政府去年向建立一个防御机构迈进了一步”。“新的国家保安队和海上警备队较以前的警察后备队和海上保安厅担负了更重要的军事任务”，“它们将成为未来陆军和海军的核心”。
    “警察后备队”在去年十月十五日改编为“保安队”时，人数已由相当于四个师的七万五千人扩充到十一万人，编制相当于五个师。这新增加的一个师，吉田政府称之为“方面队”，驻扎在密布着美国军事基地的北海道。共同社说，“方面队”的建立是“加强国家保安队的组织的第一个重要步骤”。“‘方面队’具有远胜于（原来‘警察后备队’的）‘管区队’的力量，它是一支有重武器配备的机动部队”，“在性质上等于一支有重武器装备的特遣部队”。目前，“方面队”的独立特别坦克营拥有六十辆坦克，它的特别步兵师中包括好几个榴弹炮营、重迫击炮营和机枪营，并配备有高射炮。
    共同社并透露，虽然如此，“国家保安队迄今尚未全部装备好。预定要在今年底装备完毕。”到那时，一个普通的团将得到二十七门五十七公厘和十二门七十五公厘的火箭炮、十二门六十公厘的迫击炮，二十二辆薛尔曼式坦克和约三百辆各种类型的卡车。而一个特别团则除了拥有口径更大的迫击炮之外，将有五十四门一百零五公厘口径的榴弹炮（三个营）、十八门一百五十五公厘的榴弹炮（一个营）、六十四辆装备有高射机枪的铁甲牵引车以及约五百八十辆各种类型的卡车。
    目前，吉田政府正在美国的督促下，计划大量扩充这支“保安队”，准备以这支军队作为重建日本军国主义势力的资本和供应美国侵略炮灰的来源。
