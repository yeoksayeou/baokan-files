    "Second-Grade Timber" Marked on the Lumber Stack
    Actually Sixty Percent Scrap
    Comrade Editor: I would like to criticize the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Tianjin Branch for arbitrarily raising the grade of timber to deceive buyers.
    In September of last year, our North China Directly Subordinate Second Construction Engineering Company's Tianjin Machine Factory construction site needed a batch of plywood. I purchased it from the Tianzhuang business office of the company. Their salesman, Yu Zhenfeng, received me. He asked me: "What specifications and grade do you need?" I told him that I needed four-and-a-half-centimeter-thick second-grade timber. He led me to see the goods. There was a stack of goods marked as second-grade timber. The boards on the surface looked good and met the specifications, but the two sides had slight decay. I said at the time, "I'm afraid this kind of goods is not suitable for use." Yu Zhenfeng repeatedly said: "The inside is not very bad, I guarantee it meets the specifications, and it will not hinder your use." At that time, I thought: The Coal Industry Building Materials Company and our company are both state-owned enterprises and belong to the same system, so I believed him. But as a result, only 40% of the goods could be used after they were sent to the construction site, and the rest was completely scrap.
    In this way, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Tianjin Branch completed the task of selling "timber," but it caused us a major loss. I think this kind of behavior is not allowed in state-owned enterprises.　Xu Chungen

### 货垛上标着“二等材”  实际上百分之六十是废料

    货垛上标着“二等材”
    实际上百分之六十是废料
    编辑同志：我对中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司经营木材时胡乱提高等级哄骗买主的行为，提出批评。
    去年九月份我们华北直属第二建筑工程公司的天津机器厂工地需用一批合子板，经我向该公司田庄经营处采购。当由他们的业务员于振峰接洽。他问我：“需要哪一种规格及等级？”我告诉他需用四公分半厚的二等材。他领我去看货，有一垛货垛上标明是二等材，表面上的板子还好，也合规格，但二侧的略有腐朽现象。我当时就提出“这样的货恐怕不合使用。”于振峰再三说：“内里不怎么坏，保证合规格，不会妨碍你们使用。”当时我想：煤业建筑器材公司和我们公司同为国营企业，又属于一个系统的，故此就相信了他。但结果货发至工地后只有百分之四十能用，其余的完全成废料。
    这样，中国煤业建筑器材公司天津分公司是完成了推销“木材”的任务，可是却使我们蒙受了重大的损失。我以为这种作风在国营企业中是不容许存在的。　徐纯根
