    【This Newspaper News】 The construction work of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has made great progress in the past two and a half years. By the end of last year, the completed construction area reached more than 95,000 square meters. The forging, sheet metal, and primary processing workshops have been completed and partially put into production; the steel casting workshop has also completed most of the work. The original plan was to build the factory in five years, but now it is expected to be completed within four years.

    The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is the first large-scale heavy machinery plant built in our country. In order to accelerate the process of national industrialization, the construction work began in the early stage of national economic recovery. At that time, not only was there a shortage of engineering and technical personnel, but there was also no experience in building such a large-scale factory, and even no information required for construction. Under such circumstances, the construction work took some detours, and even now there are still some relatively serious shortcomings. However, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the construction work has always been successfully carried out and has ensured that no fundamental errors have occurred in the main projects.

    Under the correct policy of focusing on key construction projects by the Central Government, all parts of the country have vigorously supported the construction work of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. This is one of the important reasons why the plant's construction work has been able to proceed smoothly. For example, when the construction work began, the East China Industrial Department transferred many engineering and technical personnel from the department and its affiliated Shanghai machinery factories to do design work for the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. Last year, the Party committees and governments of various places transferred a large number of riveters, welders, blanking workers, and assemblers from machinery factories in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Taiyuan to support the construction of the steel structure roof trusses for the steel casting workshop.

    The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has taken a series of correct measures to actively strengthen the basic construction force, which is another important reason for ensuring the smooth progress of the construction work. In July 1950, when the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant was preparing for construction, in addition to the planning office and the secretariat in Beijing, the Taiyuan Engineering Office and the Shanghai Office (design organization) had only more than 20 cadres and technical personnel, and the organizational structure was very unsound, not to mention the construction force. In order to overcome the difficulties of this weak force, the plant actively recruited technical cadres and workers through labor bureaus in various places, especially Shanghai and Taiyuan, and adopted a large number of methods to train and promote cadres. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Party and administrative leaders of the plant further determined the policy of relying on their own strength for construction, and established a strong engineering brigade and sheet metal workshop to undertake the construction tasks of civil engineering and metal structure roof trusses respectively. These measures not only enabled the project to be completed smoothly, but also created a "good, fast, and economical" example in the construction industry of Taiyuan City in individual projects. Now, the plant's organizational structure and construction force have been greatly strengthened. The preparatory office has established 13 offices and sections including planning, finance, construction, technology, and procurement, as well as a technical school, with a total of more than 880 cadres (including technical cadres) and more than 2,000 workers. In addition, the plant's engineering brigade also has more than 1,600 civil engineering workers.

    The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has grasped several major links in the construction, which is also an important reason for the smooth progress of the construction project. For example, the nearby railway and highway trunk lines were repaired early, which ensured the transportation of nearly 200,000 tons of building materials and equipment in the past two years, avoiding the phenomenon of work stoppage due to lack of materials. Another example is the timely establishment of a temporary repair and manufacturing workshop to repair and assemble the tools and mechanical equipment required for construction, which played a strong supporting role in the construction work. In particular, the sheet metal workshop was built first and put into production in a timely manner, which enabled the work of lofting, blanking, shearing, punching, drilling, riveting, welding, and assembling 2,300 tons of steel for the steel casting workshop project to be carried out smoothly.

    Soviet experts have given significant help to the design work of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, thus ensuring the correct construction of the plant. In the preliminary design of the plant, due to the unclear product plan, the designers were greedy for greatness and designed the plant as a "universal" factory, with large differences in the size and precision of the products, and each workshop maintained a large expansion margin, but the technical quotas adopted were very backward. Soviet expert Comrade Krimsky criticized this design idea of being greedy for greatness and blindly expanding, pointed out that the design of a factory must conform to the principles of economic rationality and technical advancement, and helped the designers to redo the preliminary design, arranging the independent workshops into a compact and closely connected whole, appropriately reducing the excessive workshop area, reducing unnecessary large equipment, and revising the various product plans. In this way, it was ensured that no inevitable fundamental errors occurred in the design of the main projects, and at the same time, a foundation was laid for the construction work.

    In the past two years, all the staff and workers participating in the construction work have displayed great enthusiasm and creativity. The staff and workers enthusiastically launched a production increase and economy campaign focusing on finding tricks, promoting advanced experience, and improving project quality, and achieved many results. For example, a certain project originally required 2,180 tons of steel materials, but after careful calculation by the staff and workers of the blanking and shearing groups, 109 tons were saved. Another example is that another project required pouring more than 800 cement piles, but there was a lack of equipment and experience in driving such piles. The workers actively came up with ways to modify the crane to replace the pile driver, and the foundation project was built very firmly. Another example is that the design strength was originally different by one time, and all the designers had never designed such a large and complex factory, but many designers, with the help of Soviet experts, actively learned Russian, read Soviet books, and used advanced Soviet engineering indicators and data to ensure the completion of the design tasks. Since the beginning of this year, all the staff and workers have been encouraged by the major news that the country has begun to implement the first five-year plan. Everyone is full of confidence and wants to strive to complete the construction work within four years and contribute to accelerating national industrialization.

    太原重型机器厂建厂工程进展很快
    五年建厂计划争取在四年以内完成
    【本报讯】太原重型机器厂的建厂工作，两年半来已经有了很大的成绩，到去年年底为止，已完工的建筑面积达九万五千余平方公尺。锻工、冷作、初加工车间已经完工，并已局部地开工生产；铸钢车间也完成了大部分。原计划五年建好这座工厂，现在预计可以争取在四年内完成。
    太原重型机器厂是我国开始建设的第一个规模巨大的重型机器厂。为了加速国家工业化的进程，建厂工作在国家经济恢复的初期就开始进行。当时，不但工程技术人材缺乏，而且毫无建设这样规模巨大的工厂的经验，甚至连建厂所需的资料一点也没有。在这种情况下，建厂工作曾经走了一些弯路，甚至现在还存在着一些比较严重的缺点。但是在党与政府的正确领导下，建厂工作始终成功地向前进行着，而且保证了在主要工程上没有发生过原则性的错误。
    在中央正确的重点建设的方针下，全国各地大力支援了太原重型机器厂的建厂工作。这是该厂建设工作能够顺利进行的重要原因之一。例如，建厂工作开始时，华东工业部就从部内及所属上海各机器厂抽调了很多工程技术人员，为太原重型机器厂做设计工作。去年，各地党委和政府又从天津、北京、上海、太原各机器厂调来大批的铆工、电焊工、下料工及装配工，支持铸钢车间的钢结构屋架的建筑工作。
    太原重型机器厂采取了一系列的正确措施，积极壮大基本建设的力量，是保证建厂工作顺利进行的又一重要原因。一九五○年七月，太原重型机器厂筹备建厂时，除在北京办公的计划处和秘书处外，太原工程处及上海事务所（设计机构）只有干部及技术人员二十余人，组织机构很不健全，施工力量更谈不到。为了克服这一力量薄弱的困难，该厂积极通过各地，特别是上海、太原等地的劳动局招聘技术干部和工人，并采取了大量培养和提拔干部的办法。“三反”运动以后，该厂党及行政领导方面又进一步确定了必须依靠自己的力量施工的方针，成立了强大的工程大队和冷作车间，分别担任土木建筑工程和金属结构屋架的施工任务。这些措施不仅使工程得以顺利完成，并且在个别工程上创造了太原市建筑业“好、快、省”的范例。现在，该厂组织机构与施工力量已很充实。筹备处下已建立了计划、财务、建设、技术、采购等十三个处、室及一个技工学校，共有干部（包括技术干部在内）八百八十余人，工人两千余名。另外，该厂的工程大队还有土木工人一千六百余人。
    太原重型机器厂在施工中抓住了几个主要环节，也是建厂工程进展顺利的重要原因之一。如及早修通了附近的铁路、公路干线，使两年来将近二十万吨的建筑材料、设备的运输得到保证，避免了停工待料的现象。又如及时建立了临时修造车间，修理装配建厂所需的工具、机械设备，对建厂工作起了有力的配合作用。特别是首先建设了冷作车间，并及时投入生产，使铸钢车间工程的二千三百多吨钢材的放样、下料、剪冲、钻眼、铆焊、装配等工作得以顺利进行。
    苏联专家对太原重型机器厂的设计工作给了重大的帮助，因而保证了该厂正确的施工。该厂的初步设计，由于产品方案不明确，设计人员曾经好大贪多地把这个厂设计成一个“万能”的工厂，产品大小精粗悬殊，各车间均保持了很大的扩充余地，但是所采取的技术定额却十分落后。苏联专家克林姆斯基同志批判了这种好大贪多盲目扩充的设计思想，指出了一个工厂设计必须符合经济上的合理性和技术上的先进性的原则，并帮助设计人员重作初步设计，把各自为政的车间布置为紧凑的互相密切联系的整体，把过大的车间面积适当地缩小，削减了不必要的大设备，修正了种类繁多的产品方案。这样，就保证了主要工程设计没有发生不可避免的原则错误，同时为施工工作奠定了基础。
    两年来，参加建厂工作的全体职工，发挥了极大的积极性和创造性。职工们热烈地展开了以找窍门、推广先进经验、提高工程质量为主要内容的增产节约竞赛运动，取得了不少的成绩。例如某项工程原需用钢料二千一百八十吨，经下料、剪冲两个小组的职工精打细算后，节约了一百零九吨。又如另一工程需浇灌水泥桩八百多根，但缺乏打这种桩的设备和经验，工人们积极想办法，改装起重机代替打桩机，把基础工程筑得很坚固。又如设计力量原来相差一倍，而且所有设计人员都没有设计过这样庞大而复杂的工厂，但是许多设计人员，在苏联专家帮助下，积极学习俄文、阅读苏联书籍，使用苏联先进的工程指数和资料，保证完成了设计任务。今年开始，全体职工又为国家开始实行第一个五年计划的重大消息所鼓舞，大家信心百倍地要争取在四年内完成建厂工作，为加速国家工业化贡献力量。
