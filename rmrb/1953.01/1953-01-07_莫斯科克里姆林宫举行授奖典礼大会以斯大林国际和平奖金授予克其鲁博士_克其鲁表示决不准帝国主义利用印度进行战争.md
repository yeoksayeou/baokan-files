Amidst warm applause, Skobeltsyn awarded the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize medal and certificate to Dr. Kitchlew. Subsequently, Tikhonov, representative of the Soviet Peace Committee, Chereednichenko, representative of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Kholopova, representative of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, and Pudovkin, film director and representative of Soviet cultural workers, delivered speeches congratulating Kitchlew on receiving the prize.

Dr. Kitchlew then spoke, expressing his deep gratitude for bestowing this honor upon him. He said that he believes the decision of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee is an honor for the Indian peace movement and for the hundreds of thousands of peace workers in India. This prize is awarded to my country, my people, and the great, growing Indian peace movement. Dr. Kitchlew then described in detail the nationwide peace movement in India. He said: We will never allow an inch of our land, a port, an airport, a yard of rail, or a drop of blood to be used for the imperialists' wars. I believe that awarding this prize to an Indian will greatly help strengthen the friendly relations between India and the Soviet Union. I want to declare here that no force in the world can make the Indian people participate directly or indirectly in any war against the Soviet Union. Dr. Kitchlew finally assured the assembly that he would do his utmost to be worthy of the international prize bearing Stalin's name, because Stalin has received the highest respect and love from hundreds of millions of people in the world, and Stalin has dedicated his life to the cause of peace.
