Since 1951, Arong Banner in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has promoted the Soviet "artificial insemination horse breeding method," and now fine foals are galloping in droves across the vast grasslands.

Arong Banner is one of Inner Mongolia's "horse-producing bases," so its horses are tall and fat, suitable for use as draught animals. However, there were very few stallions, and the number of mares mated each year accounted for only one-tenth of the total number of mares in the banner. The conception rate was also very low, which seriously affected the large-scale breeding of horses. To this end, the banner's stud farm specially sent people to the Northeast region to study the "artificial insemination horse breeding method," and began to promote it as a priority in 1951. The average conception rate of this artificial insemination method was 31.7% higher than the natural mating conception rate in 1950. Last year, the number of mares inseminated in the entire banner reached 51% of the total number of mares in the banner. After publicity, farmers have requested the establishment of more "artificial insemination horse breeding stations" and have automatically built ten artificial insemination operating rooms. Recently, the stud farm has also opened an "artificial insemination horse breeding training class," preparing to popularize this advanced method throughout the banner this year.

### 内蒙古阿荣旗积极推行“人工授精配马法”

    内蒙古阿荣旗积极推行“人工授精配马法”
    内蒙古自治区呼纳盟的阿荣旗自一九五一年推广苏联的“人工授精配马法”以来，良马驹已成群地奔驰在辽阔的草原上。
    阿荣旗是内蒙古的“产马基地”之一，所以马匹体高肥大，适于作耕畜。但种马很少，当年交配的母马仅占全旗母马总数的十分之一，受胎率又很低，严重地影响了马匹的大量繁殖。为此，该旗种畜场特派人去东北区学习了“人工授精配马法”，一九五一年并开始重点推广。这种人工授精配马的平均受胎率，比一九五○年自然交配的受胎率提高了百分之三十一点七。去年全旗受配母马已达到全旗母马总数的百分之五十一。经过宣传后，农民纷纷要求多设“人工授精配马站”，并自动修盖了十所人工授精操作室。最近种畜场又开办了“人工授精配马训练班”，准备今年在全旗普遍推广这种先进方法。
