    Central Ministry of Education Issues Notice Regarding Regulations for Primary and Secondary School Visits in Beijing
    People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: On December 18th of last year, the "Readers' Letters" page published reader Zhao Pijie's letter regarding "Some schools in Beijing are experiencing serious work disruptions due to excessive visitors." The letter stated: "Recently, educational workers from various regions have been continuously coming to Beijing for visits, which has played a significant role in exchanging experiences and promoting educational reform. However, many visiting groups are organized in a decentralized manner, and their preparations are inadequate, which has caused serious disruptions to some primary and secondary schools in Beijing, especially primary schools." This situation is genuine. In order to more effectively leverage the role of visits and assist primary and secondary schools in Beijing to overcome serious disruptions, our ministry has issued a notice and stipulated the following two measures, which should be communicated to subordinate units by local education departments for compliance:
    (1) Visits to primary and secondary schools in Beijing for educational purposes should be organized by provinces (cities) as visiting groups. The visiting groups should have strong leadership, thorough preparation, and clear visiting objectives in order to more effectively leverage the role of visits.
    (2) When visiting Beijing, all visiting groups should consult with the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau in advance to obtain their consent, so that the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau can make preparations for arranging work and assisting with the visits. Before obtaining the consent of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, no visiting groups should come to Beijing on their own. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央教育部已通报规定来北京参观中小学的办法
    人民日报读者来信组：去年十二月十八日“读者来信专页”发表了读者赵丕杰关于“北京市某些学校因参观者过多，造成严重工作忙乱现象”的来信。来信中提出：最近各地教育工作者接连不断来北京参观，这在交流经验、推动教育改革工作方面起了很大作用；但是不少参观团都是分散组成的，事前准备工作又做得不够，就给北京市部分中、小学特别是小学造成严重的忙乱现象。这个情况是真实的。为了更有效地发挥参观的作用和协助北京市各中、小学克服严重的忙乱现象，我部已发出通报，并规定以下两点办法，让各地教育部门转知所属单位遵照执行：
    （一）各地区来北京参观中、小学教育，应以省
    （市）为单位组织参观团；参观团应有强的领导、充分的准备、明确的参观目的，以便更有效地发挥参观的作用。
    （二）各参观团来北京参观时，事前应直接商得北京市教育局同意，以便北京市教育局能够有准备地安排工作和协助参观；在没有得到北京市教育局同意以前，各参观团不得自行来京。  中央人民政府教育部
