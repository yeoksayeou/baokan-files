Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. On January 4th, at approximately 10:15 and 10:18 AM, U.S. military aircraft again violated the agreement on the Kaesong Neutral Zone and twice intruded into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. Since the U.S. side unilaterally suspended negotiations on October 8th, U.S. military aircraft have frequently and continuously violated the above agreement, intruding into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area, the Kaesong neutral zone, and even the neutral zone of the Kaesong-Panmunjom corridor. To this end, our chief liaison officer protested to the other side on December 30th of last year and demanded that the other side strictly abide by the agreement. However, the other side's chief liaison officer sent a letter on January 2nd of this year attempting to shirk responsibility, wantonly distorting [the facts] by claiming: "As long as no hostile acts are carried out in these areas, such overflights do not violate the spirit of the existing understanding between the liaison officers, but belong to the exceptional circumstances of 'climatic conditions and technical conditions beyond control' stipulated in Article 5 of the understanding." On January 7th, our chief liaison officer sent a letter to the other side protesting the incident of U.S. military aircraft intruding into the conference area on January 4th and refuting the other side's factually baseless excuses in its letter of January 2nd, which attempted to shirk responsibility for violating the agreement. Our side pointed out: The agreement between the liaison officers of both sides stipulates that all armed forces of both sides shall not carry out any hostile actions against the Panmunjom conference area. The overflight of military aircraft itself constitutes a hostile act. The other side has also clearly admitted that such overflights constitute a violation of the agreement. Unless the other side is deliberately tearing up the agreement and determined to undermine the maintenance of the conference area, the other side must assume the obligation of strictly abiding by the letter and spirit of the agreement. The full text of the letter from our chief liaison officer to the other side on January 7th is as follows:

To: Colonel Carrock, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

    On January 4th, at approximately 10:15 and 10:18 AM, your military aircraft violated the agreement and twice intruded into the airspace over the conference area, for which I protest to you. The agreement between the liaison officers of both sides stipulates that all armed forces of both sides shall not carry out any hostile actions against the Panmunjom conference area. The overflight of military aircraft itself constitutes a hostile act and is expressly prohibited by the understanding of the aforementioned agreement. Since October 8th, your side has admitted six times that your military aircraft overflew the conference area, clearly admitting that the overflight of military aircraft over the conference area constituted a violation of the agreement on the neutrality of the conference area. Although your side claims that your violations of the agreement were not intentional, it is clear that your side is not allowed to arbitrarily shirk responsibility for such violations of the agreement with the factually baseless excuse of "climatic and technical conditions beyond control," otherwise the maintenance of the conference area will not be guaranteed at all. Unless your side is deliberately tearing up the agreement on neutral zone affairs between the liaison officers of both sides, which is the basis of the armistice negotiations, your side must assume the obligation of strictly abiding by the letter and spirit of this agreement. Therefore, I once again solemnly request that your side earnestly abide by the agreement, strictly restrain your military personnel, and ensure that violations of the agreement do not happen again.

    我方严斥美方歪曲事实推卸违反协议责任
    要求美方必须使违反协议事件不再发生
    【新华社开城七日电】一月四日十时十五分与十时十八分左右，美方军用飞机又违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，两次侵入板门店会场区上空。自去年十月八日美方片面休会中断停战谈判以来，美方军用飞机违反上述协议，经常不断地侵入板门店会场区、开城中立区以至开城至板门店通道中立区的上空。为此我方首席联络官曾于去年十二月三十日向对方提出抗议，并要求对方严格遵守协议，但对方首席联络官今年一月二日来信企图推卸责任，肆意歪曲称：“只要在这些地区内不进行敌对行为，这种飞越并不违反联络官之间现存的谅解的精神，而系属于谅解第五条所规定的‘气候条件与技术条件无法控制’的例外情形”。一月七日我方首席联络官致函对方，对一月四日美方军用飞机侵犯会场区事件提出抗议，并驳斥对方一月二日来信中企图推卸违反协议的责任的毫无事实根据的借口。我方指出：双方联络官间的协议规定双方一切武装力量不得对板门店会场区进行任何敌对行动。军用飞机的飞越本身构成敌对行动。对方也曾明白承认过这种飞越构成了违反协议的事件。对方若非蓄意撕毁协议，决心破坏会场区的维持，对方就必须负起严格遵守协议的文字与精神的义务。我方首席联络官一月七日致对方的信全文如下：联合国军代表团首席联络官卡洛克上校：
    一月四日十时十五分与十时十八分左右，你方军用飞机违反协议，两次侵入会场区上空，对此我向你提出抗议。双方联络官间的协议规定双方一切武装力量不得对板门店会场区进行任何敌对行动。军用飞机的飞越本身构成敌对行动，为上述协议的谅解所明确禁止。你方自十月八日以来，六次承认你方军用飞机飞越会场区的事件时，明白承认了军用飞机飞越会场区构成了违反会场区中立性协议的事件。虽然你方自称你方违反协议的行为并非出自有意，很显然的对于这种违反协议的行为不容许你方毫无事实根据地任意以“气候与技术条件无法控制”的借口推卸责任，否则会场区之维持将根本无法予以保证。你方若非蓄意撕毁作为停战谈判基础的双方联络官间关于中立区事宜的协议，你方就必须负起严格遵守此项协议的文字与精神的义务。因此我再次郑重要求你方切实遵守协议，严格约束你方军事人员，使违反协议的事件不再发生。
