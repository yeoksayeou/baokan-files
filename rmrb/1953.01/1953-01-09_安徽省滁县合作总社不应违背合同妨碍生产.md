    Anhui Province Chuxian County Cooperative Federation Should Not Obstruct Production in Violation of Contract
    To the Editor: The Chuxian County Cooperative Federation in Anhui Province has repeatedly failed to execute contracts signed at the materials exchange fair, creating a negative impact among the masses.
    Last June, the Chuxian County Cooperative Federation signed a contract with the Sanjuheng Grain Store, a private merchant in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, at the Anhui Province materials exchange fair to sell 60,000 jin of barley. Due to insufficient prior estimation, they were ultimately unable to deliver the goods on time, causing great dissatisfaction among the private merchant. However, the federation still did not pay attention to this matter. On September 13th of last year, at the Chuxian County materials exchange fair, the federation again signed a contract with the tofu industry in Wuyi Town to sell 15,000 jin of soybeans, stipulating that payment and delivery would occur on September 18th. At that time, all members of the tofu industry collected 6 million yuan and applied for a loan of 3 million yuan and a remittance of 3 million yuan from the bank, totaling 12 million yuan, which was paid to the cooperative federation on September 17th. On the 18th, the tofu industry sent Fang Yongfu as a representative to pick up the goods. The responsible comrade of the federation said, "The goods have not yet arrived due to rain" (in fact, it only rained on the 18th, and the goods should have arrived before the 18th). On September 20th, they said that the goods could not be delivered until the 24th, but they still had not arrived by the afternoon of the 26th. At this time, the new soybeans had already entered the market, and the bank loan had also expired. As a result, the tofu industry was greatly affected, and four tofu shops had already closed down due to the lack of soybean supply. This batch of soybeans did not arrive in Wuyi Town until the 29th. Tofu industry members reflected one after another: "The cooperative federation has repeatedly broken its promise, affecting our capital turnover and delaying our production. If we hadn't signed a contract with the cooperative federation, we would have bought new soybeans to grind long ago."
    The Chuxian County Cooperative Federation's breach of trust continued to occur afterward. The Chuxian County People's Government notified the federation to immediately conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the execution of materials exchange contracts and report to the Industry and Commerce Section. The federation handled this work perfunctorily, and many parts of the report sent to the Industry and Commerce Section were not detailed enough. For example, many problems had occurred with the soybean contract, but the federation only filled in "payment and delivery" in the execution process column of the report. The Industry and Commerce Section put forward opinions, asking them to make further supplements, and repeatedly urged the responsible comrade of the federation several times by telephone, letter, and in person, but they still ignored them. We believe that this work style of the Chuxian County Cooperative Federation is extremely wrong and should be deeply examined.

    Editor's Note: The Chuxian County Cooperative Federation has repeatedly failed to abide by contracts and has even ignored the opinions of the Industry and Commerce Section of the County People's Government. The Industry and Commerce Section of the County People's Government should give them a disciplinary action. At the same time, we hope that the board of directors and supervisors of the Chuxian County Cooperative Federation will pay attention to inspecting the work of the federation's staff and correct their mistakes.

### 安徽省滁县合作总社不应违背合同妨碍生产

    安徽省滁县合作总社不应违背合同妨碍生产
    编辑同志：安徽省滁县合作总社屡不执行在物资交流会上签订的合同，在群众中造成不良影响。
    去年六月，滁县合作总社在安徽省物资交流会上和山西太原私商三聚恒粮店订立售给六万斤大麦的合同，因事前估计不足，结果到期没法交货，招致私商极大不满。但该社对此事仍未引起重视。去年九月十三日在滁县物资交流会上，该社又与乌衣镇豆腐业订了售给一万五千斤黄豆的合同，规定九月十八日付款交货，当时豆腐业全体会员凑集了六百万元，并向银行申请贷款三百万元、押汇三百万元，共一千二百万元，于九月十七日付给合作社，十八日豆腐业即派方永富代表去取货，该社负责同志说：“因下雨尚未运到”（其实十八日那天才下雨，货应在十八日前运到）。九月二十日又说二十四日才能交货，但等到二十六日下午仍未见到。这时新豆已上市，银行贷款亦已到期，因而豆腐业受到很大影响，有四家豆腐店因黄豆供应不上并已停业。这批黄豆直到二十九日才运到乌衣镇。豆腐业会员纷纷反映：“合作社屡次不守信用，影响了我们的资金周转，耽误了我们的生产，要是不与合作社订合同，早就买到新黄豆来磨了。”
    滁县合作总社不守信用的事情以后又不断发生，滁县人民政府通知该社立即全面深入检查物资交流合同执行情况，并报工商科。该社对这一工作却敷敷衍衍，送到工商科的报告有很多地方不够详实，如黄豆合同曾发生过不少问题，但该社在报表执行经过栏内只填“付款交货”。工商科提出意见，请他们再作补充，并且曾用电话、书信和当面向该社负责同志催过好几次，但他们仍是置之不理。我们认为滁县合作总社这种工作作风是极端错误的，应作深刻检讨。

    编者按：滁县合作总社屡次不遵守合同，且对县人民政府工商科的意见竟然置之不理，县人民政府工商科应该给以处分。同时，我们希望滁县合作总社的理、监事会注意检查该社工作人员的工作，纠正他们的错误。
