Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 17th Dispatch from TASS: The 1953 session of the French National Assembly opened on the 14th. Following the custom of having the eldest member deliver the opening address, French Communist MP Marcel Cachin addressed the Assembly. In his speech, Cachin emphasized the French people's determination to fight for peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and the restoration of the national economy.

Cachin said: France "is mired in a political and economic crisis, and there is widespread discontent throughout the country." Workers' wages and the salaries of lower and middle-ranking civil servants are insufficient, and the purchasing power of the masses is constantly declining, while the income of capitalist trusts is increasing daily. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers is constantly increasing. There is an extreme shortage of housing and school buildings. The living conditions of the elderly and those receiving meager allowances are absolutely unbearable. Currency instability and inflation further aggravate the general unrest.

Cachin then demanded an immediate end to the slaughter of the Vietnamese people and condemned the policy of suppressing the national independence movements of colonial peoples, considering it a violation of the spirit and letter of the French Constitution.

Cachin emphasized that the French people must fight for peace, national independence, and social justice in 1953.

He said: The French people participated in the international peace movement. They agreed with the proposals put forward by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. They unanimously believe that humanity can avoid the horrors of another war; the basic condition for avoiding war is that the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, Democratic China, and France, the five great powers, should hold negotiations as soon as possible, listen to each other's opinions, and conclude a peace treaty.

The peace-loving French people have always been loyal to national independence. France is unwilling to accept the cosmopolitan theory that "the concept of national sovereignty is outdated," because this theory seeks to destroy France and insult France's great and long history. France must defend its right to decide its own destiny and continue to be the master of its own territory! France only wants its own troops stationed on its own territory!

Peace remains the great wish of the French people, who, in any case, remain loyal to the democratic traditions and basic human rights of the French Republic. They abhor any form of fascism.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch from Paris: After a half-month of government crisis, Radical Socialist leader René Mayer formed a "new" government on the 8th. In this government, Georges Bidault (Popular Republican Movement) is Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury (Radical Socialist) is Minister of Finance, Jean Moreau (Independent Republican) is Minister of Budget, and Robert Buron (Popular Republican Movement) is Minister of Economy; Deputy Prime Minister Henri Queuille (Radical Socialist) and most other ministers remain, including René Pleven, the drafter of the "European Army Plan," who remains Minister of National Defense, Jean Letourneau, responsible for the colonial war in Vietnam, remains Minister of Relations with Associated States, and Charles Brune and Martine-Deplant, known for their anti-communist and anti-democratic stance, remain Minister of the Interior and Minister of Justice. All this confirms that the Mayer government will continue to pursue policies of aggression, war preparation, and fascism, and will therefore meet the same fate as its predecessors.

Mayer, in his policy speech to the National Assembly on the 6th, had already declared that the "cornerstone of French foreign policy" was the United States' advocacy of a "unified Europe." Although Mayer, when forming the cabinet, had expressed his intention to demand revisions to the "European Army" agreement in order to ease opposition to this "unified" concept, he immediately expressed his loyalty to his American masters after forming the cabinet. Mayer, in a speech at a banquet of the American and British Press Association in Paris on the 14th, emphasized that his government had decided "without delay" to have the parliament approve the "European Army" agreement and the Bonn Treaty.

The most important change in the new government is the removal of Robert Schuman. Schuman is one of the main agents of the United States in France, the proposer of the "European Coal and Steel Community" plan and the signatory of the "European Army" agreement and the Bonn Treaty. His foreign policy has long been strongly opposed by the French people. Some members of the French bourgeoisie, also for their own interests, have become increasingly dissatisfied with this policy of betraying national interests. Schuman's removal illustrates the enormous difficulties that the American "European unification" plan has encountered in France.

In domestic affairs, Mayer stated that he would continue to implement the financial policies of the Pinay government, which had already gone bankrupt, and said that "the first task" he would propose to the parliament after the budget was passed "is to revise the constitution."

The bourgeois newspapers in Paris have already predicted that the "new" French government will still face a financial crisis and a political crisis. "L'Aurore" said: "Even if the currently expanded majority approves the principle of the finance bill, getting the parliament to pass the written provisions is a completely different matter." "Le Figaro" said: "How can a cabinet composed of complex parties, chaotic situations internally, and threatened externally be united?"

    法共议员加香谴责法国政府反动政策
    号召法国人民争取和平、独立与民主自由
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会一九五三年度的会议在十四日开幕。按照由年事最多的议员致词的惯例，法国共产党议员马赛尔·加香在会上致开幕辞。加香在致词中强调法国人民决心为争取和平、民族独立、民主自由和恢复国民经济而斗争。
    加香说：法国“正陷于政治与经济危机之中，全国普遍存在着不满情绪”。工人们的工资和中下级公务人员的薪金是不够用的，广大群众的购买力在不断地下降，然而资本家的托辣斯的收入日益增加。失业工人和半失业工人的人数不断增加。住房和学校房舍极端缺乏。老年人和那些获得菲薄津贴的人们的生活情况已经是绝对不堪忍受的了。币值不稳和通货膨胀又使得普遍动荡不安的情况更加严重。
    加香接着要求立即停止屠杀越南人民，并且谴责镇压殖民地人民民族独立运动的政策，认为这是违反了法国宪法的精神和文字。
    加香强调：法国人民在一九五三年要为和平、民族独立和社会正义而斗争。
    他说：法国人民参加了国际和平运动。他们同意维也纳世界人民和平大会所提出的各项建议。他们一致认为，人类可以避免另一次战争的恐怖；避免战争的基本条件，就是美国、苏联、英国、民主中国和法国五大国尽速进行谈判，互相倾听意见，并且缔结和平公约。
    爱好和平的法国人民始终忠于民族独立。法国不愿意接受“民族主权的观念已经过时”的这种世界主义的理论，因为这种理论要毁灭法国，侮辱法国伟大而悠久的历史。法国要保卫自己决定自己命运的权利，要继续作自己领土上的主人！法国只愿意让它自己的军队驻扎在自己的领土上！
    和平仍然是法国人民的伟大愿望，法国人民，在任何情形下，仍然忠于法兰西共和国的民主传统和基本人权。他们憎恨任何形式的法西斯化。
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎消息：经过了半个月的政府危机后，法国激进社会党领袖雷纳·迈耶在八日组成“新”政府。在这个政府中，乔治·皮杜尔（人民共和党）任外交部长，莫里斯·布歇—莫诺里（激进社会党）任财政部长，让·摩卢（独立共和党）任预算部长，罗伯·布隆（人民共和党）任经济部长；副总理亨利·葛义（激进社会党）及其他大部分部长均仍旧，其中包括“欧洲军计划”的拟订者雷纳·普利文留任国防部长，负责越南殖民战争的让·勒都尔诺留任联邦成员国关系部长以及以反共反民主出名的夏尔·布吕纳和马丁诺—德勃拉留任内政部长和司法部长。这一切就确定了迈耶政府将继续执行侵略、备战和法西斯化的政策，因而也将遭遇它的前任同样的命运。
    迈耶六日在向国民议会发表政纲演说时，就已经宣布：“法国外交政策的基石”，就是美国的“统一的欧洲”的主张。迈耶在组阁时虽然曾为了缓和这种“统一”观念所受到的反对而表示将要求修改“欧洲军”协定，但他在组成内阁后就立刻向美国主人表示忠诚。迈耶十四日在巴黎美英记者协会的宴会上发表演说时强调说，他的政府已经决定“毫不延迟地”要议会批准“欧洲军”协定和波恩战争条约。
    在新政府人员中，最重要的改变是罗柏·舒曼的下台。舒曼是美国在法国的主要代理人之一，是“欧洲煤钢联营”计划的提出者和“欧洲军”协定，波恩战争条约的签订人。他的外交政策早就遭到了法国人民的强烈反对。法国一部分资产阶级人士也因为本身的利益，对于这种出卖民族利益的政策越来越不满。舒曼的下台，说明美国的“欧洲统一”计划在法国碰到了如何巨大的困难。
    在内政方面，迈耶表示要继续执行比内政府已经破产了的财政政策，并且说：在预算案通过后，他要向议会提出的“第一个任务就是修改宪法”。
    巴黎各资产阶级报纸已预先断定，法国“新”政府将仍然面临着财政危机和政治危机。“震旦报”说：“即使目前扩大了的多数派通过财政法案的原则，但是要叫议会通过写好的条文又完全是另外一回事。”“费加罗报”说：“这个政府的组成，内部是党派复杂、情况混乱，外部受到威胁：这样的内阁如何能团结呢？”
