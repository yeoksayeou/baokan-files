    [This article reports on the] East China Construction Workers Union Holds Meeting, Decides to Strengthen Union Work.
    [This Newspaper reported] (By Our Correspondent) To strengthen the work of the East China Construction Workers Union and ensure the completion of large-scale construction tasks, the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions not only established the East China Construction Workers Union Working Committee to strengthen leadership but also convened the first East China Regional Construction Workers Union Work Conference from January 10th to 15th, gathering responsible cadres from construction unions in various provinces and cities in East China.
    The meeting reviewed the basic situation and main problems of the current work of the East China Construction Workers Union. Due to the rapid expansion of basic construction forces, the number of construction workers in the East China region has increased to more than 378,000. Under the leadership of the Party committees and local trade unions, construction unions in various parts of East China have successively mobilized more than 50,000 workers to carry out democratic reforms and have focused on promoting various advanced experiences, initially improving the working and living conditions of workers. More than 7,000 workers on eight construction sites in Wuxi City carried out labor competitions, and production efficiency generally increased by more than 80%, saving the country 2 billion yuan of wealth. In Shandong Province, 20% of construction workers have learned various advanced working methods. In Jinan Workers' New Village alone, the implementation of advanced working methods saved 2.2 billion yuan in various construction costs.
    However, because construction workers used to move frequently and live in scattered locations, and because organizational work was relatively weak, and the number of workers has grown rapidly in the past six months, there are still some serious problems in the current work of the East China Construction Workers Union. The main problems are: the union has not been able to organize all employees; nearly half of the workers have not been admitted to the union; the union work has not been able to face the construction sites and go deep into the grassroots. Only over 1,300 grassroots organizations have been established in the sixteen large and medium-sized cities in East China, and there is an even greater shortage of union cadres. In addition, some administrative cadres have not implemented the idea of relying on the working class very well and have failed to earnestly promote democracy and support the union. Some administrative cadres have not established the concept of safe production and are indifferent to the safety and health of workers. The most serious case is that a construction company in Qingdao even signed a "three-no-care contract" with workers, openly claiming that the administration "does not care about illness, tools, or death" for workers. Therefore, industrial accidents continue to occur in various places.
    The meeting held that with the current large-scale economic construction beginning nationwide, the above situation must be fundamentally reversed. After repeated discussions, specific steps and methods for strengthening union work have been formulated. It is hoped that the Party organizations and other relevant departments in various parts of East China can further strengthen their leadership and support for the construction union.
    Zhang Canming, Deputy Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a report at the meeting. He emphasized that the purpose of strengthening the work of the construction union is to mobilize the masses of workers to guarantee the completion and early completion of national construction tasks, and to effectively improve the lives of workers under this premise. He asked construction unions in various parts of East China to quickly improve their leadership organizations, strengthen trade union work at construction sites, develop a large number of members, train trade union cadres, and cooperate with the administration to do the following: (1) continue to implement democratic reforms and fully carry out winter training; (2) earnestly promote advanced experiences, carry out rationalization proposal campaigns, and organize labor competitions; (3) improve business management and establish various dedicated systems; (4) strive to complete the preparations for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations before March;
    (5) conscientiously strengthen labor protection work, implement the policy of safe production, and effectively solve problems such as medical and health care and board and lodging on construction sites.

    华东建筑工会举行会议决定加强工会工作
    【本报讯】为了加强华东建筑工会工作，保证完成大规模建设任务，全国总工会华东办事处除新建立了华东建筑工会工作委员会以加强领导外，并于一月十日至十五日，召集华东各省、市建筑工会负责干部，举行了华东区第一次建筑工会工作会议。
    会议检查了目前华东建筑工会工作的基本情况和主要问题。由于基本建设力量的迅速扩展，华东全区建筑工人数量已增长到三十七万八千余人。华东各地建筑工会在党委和地方工会的领导下，先后发动五万余工人进行了民主改革，并重点推广了各种先进经验，初步改善了工人的劳动条件和生活条件。无锡市八个工地上七千多工人开展劳动竞赛，生产效率普遍提高了百分之八十以上，为国家节约了二十亿元的财富；山东全省已有百分之二十的建筑工人学会了各种先进工作法，单济南工人新村一个工地推行先进工作法后就节省了各种建筑费用二十二亿元。
    但是，由于过去建筑工人经常流动，居住分散，组织工作比较薄弱，半年来工人数量又迅速增长，目前华东建筑工会工作还存在着一些严重问题。主要是：工会还没有能把全体职工组织起来，近半数的工人还没有吸收入会；工会工作还没有能很好地面向工地，深入基层；华东十六个大、中城市一共才建立了一千三百多个基层组织，工会干部更加缺少。另外，某些行政干部对依靠工人阶级的思想还贯彻得很差，未能认真发扬民主，支持工会；某些行政干部还没有树立安全生产的观念，对工人安全卫生漠不关心，最严重的如青岛某建筑公司竟与工人订“三不管合同”，公开声称行政对工人是“病不管、工具不管、死不管”，因此各地工伤事故还不断发生。
    会议认为目前全国大规模经济建设已经开始，上述情况必须根本扭转。经反复讨论后，已订出加强工会工作的具体步骤和做法。并希望华东各地各有关部门，首先是党的组织能更进一步加强对建筑工会的领导与支持。
    全国总工会华东办事处副主任张灿明在会议上做了报告。他着重说明：加强建筑工会工作的目的，在于发动工人群众保证完成和提前完成国家建设任务，并在这个前提下切实改善工人的生活。他要求华东各地建筑工会迅速健全领导机构，加强工地工会工作，大量发展会员，培养工会干部，并应配合行政做好下列各项工作：（一）继续贯彻民主改革，全面开展冬季训练；（二）认真推广先进经验，开展合理化建议运动，组织劳动竞赛；（三）改善经营管理，建立各种专责制度；（四）争取在三月份前完成实施劳动保险条例的各项准备工作；
    （五）认真加强劳动保护工作，贯彻安全生产的方针，切实解决工地上医药卫生以及膳宿等问题。
