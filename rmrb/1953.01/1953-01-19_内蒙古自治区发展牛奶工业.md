    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has begun to develop its milk industry. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has an extremely abundant milk production, but in the past it was only supplied for the herders' own consumption, and the surplus was wasted. It is estimated that the milk wasted each year is worth about one million tons of grain.
    In 1951, the Hulunbuir League pastoral area supply and marketing cooperative in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region trialed the establishment of a milk processing plant, which was warmly welcomed by the herders. Everyone actively sold their surplus milk to the processing plant. By the end of last year, the number of milk processing plants in Hulunbuir League had grown to more than twenty. Last year, a total of 9 million jin of milk was purchased, producing 380,000 jin of cream, 160,000 jin of casein (chemical raw material), and 35,000 pounds of milk powder. The purchase of this surplus milk greatly increased the income of the herders. For example, after 200 Mongolian herder households in the Solon Banner of the League sold 720,000 jin of milk last year, their average income increased by 18 million yuan per household.
    In order to develop the milk industry, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Cooperative Union established a Cream Company in Hailar City to be responsible for leading the milk processing plants in the entire region. Based on the experience of Hulunbuir League in establishing the milk industry over the past two years, the Cream Company decided to add nine processing plants in Hulunbuir League this year, and to trial the establishment of one milk processing plant each in Hinggan League and Jirem League. This year, the milk processed in the entire region can reach more than 18 million jin, and the output of products such as cream, casein, and milk powder will also greatly increase.

    内蒙古自治区发展牛奶工业
    内蒙古自治区开始发展牛奶工业。内蒙古自治区牛奶产量极为丰富，但过去仅仅供给牧民自家饮用，多余的都浪费了，各地每年所浪费的牛奶，据估计约值一百万吨粮食。
    一九五一年，内蒙古自治区呼纳盟牧区供销合作社试办牛奶加工厂，受到牧民的热烈欢迎，大家纷纷把多余的牛奶卖给加工厂，截至去年年底，呼纳盟的牛奶加工厂已发展到二十所之多，去年共收购牛奶九百万斤，制出奶油三十八万斤、酪胶（化工原料）十六万斤，乳粉三万五千磅。收购这些多余的牛奶，大大增加了牧民的收入。如该盟索伦旗的二百户蒙族牧民，在去年卖出七十二万斤牛奶后，平均每户增加了一千八百万元的收入。
    为了发展牛奶工业，内蒙古自治区合作社联合社在海拉尔市设立了奶油公司，负责领导全区的牛奶加工厂。根据呼纳盟两年来创办牛奶工业的经验，奶油公司决定今年在呼纳盟增设加工厂九所，兴安盟、哲里木盟试办牛奶加工厂各一所。全区今年的加工牛奶可达到一千八百万斤以上，奶油、酪胶、乳粉等产品的产量也将大大增加。（据新华社讯）
