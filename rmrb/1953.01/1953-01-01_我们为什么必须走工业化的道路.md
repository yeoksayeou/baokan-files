Why We Must Take the Road of Industrialization
He Li

    The "industrialization" that the Chinese people have longed for for over a century has now been placed on the agenda of national life. This is the greatest good news for the Chinese people.

    Chairman Mao once described the Chinese people's pursuit of industrialization in "On Coalition Government." He said: "In a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, and divided China, to develop industry, build national defense, benefit the people, and bring about national prosperity and strength, how many people have dreamed this dream for many years, but all have been shattered. Many well-intentioned educators, scientists, and students, regardless of politics, thought they could serve the country with what they had learned, but the results also turned into dreams and were all shattered."

    The Chinese Communist Party, leading the people of the whole country, has finally turned the illusion into reality after thirty years of sacrifice and struggle, enabling the people of the whole country to have a real opportunity to carry out large-scale economic construction. How can this not be sincerely congratulated!

    Now that the conditions are ripe, we must not only realize the industrialization of the country, but also accelerate industrialization. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao said: "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." (See "On Coalition Government") A modern country cannot survive without a strong industrial foundation.

    To become an advanced industrial country, industry must account for a large proportion of the entire national economy, and the production of means of production (mainly heavy industry) must exceed the production of means of livelihood in the entire industry. For example, when the Soviet Union completed national industrialization after the first five-year plan (early 1933), the proportion of industrial products in the total output of the national economy had increased to 70% (it was only 42.1% in 1913). The proportion of production tools and means of production in all large-scale industries increased from 48.5% in 1929 to 57%. Only in this way can we guarantee continuous growth in production.

    However, when we say "industrialization," it does not mean that we should develop every kind of industry. The focus of industrialization, its foundation, lies in the development of heavy industry (fuel, metals, etc.), in the final manufacture of the means of production, and in the development of our own machine manufacturing industry." (See Stalin's "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union") According to this principle instructed by Stalin, in our future large-scale national construction, we must not only focus on industrial construction, but light industry must also be subordinate to the development of heavy industry.

    Should we develop light industry first, or heavy industry first? These are two paths to world industrialization. Developing light industry first and then gradually developing heavy industry is the path of capitalism. Building heavy industry first and then developing light industry, and transforming agriculture on the basis of developing heavy industry, is the path of socialism. We must take the socialist road, not the capitalist road. The reason is that our current conditions are different from those in the early days of world capitalism. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there was no imperialism in the world, and the capitalism of various countries could develop freely. However, since the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, international imperialism has formed and directly invaded the whole world. Anyone who develops slowly will only facilitate imperialist aggression and will eventually fail to develop. "Starting with light industry" is a fallacy often spread by imperialists to the people of the colonies. For example, when Nelson, the representative of U.S. President Roosevelt, came to China in 1943 to serve as the economic adviser to the Kuomintang government, he came to such a conclusion on the development of China's economy: "Weak China sincerely needs construction, but starting with heavy industry will not allow it to catch up with the United States even in a hundred years. If it starts with light industry, it can get rich immediately within ten years." At that time, the Kuomintang hurriedly followed the will of its American master and established a "Textile Construction Committee" under its Ministry of Economic Affairs, taking a colonial road. Now the people of New China will never take this road.

    Our road must be to develop heavy industry from the very beginning. Lenin said in "The Fifth Anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution": "To save Russia, it is not enough to rely on a bumper harvest of the peasant economy, nor is it enough to rely on the prosperity of light industry that supplies consumer goods to the peasants—we must also have heavy industry." "Without saving heavy industry, without restoring heavy industry, we cannot build any industry, and without industry, we cannot maintain our position as an independent country at all." (See "Selected Works of Lenin," Volume 2, Moscow Chinese Edition, p. 989) In "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan," Stalin also addressed those who opposed the construction of heavy industry: "However, it must be known, it must be thought about, what kind of results this policy of putting the task of industrialization at the end will bring us. Of course, we can take half of the 1.5 billion gold rubles spent on heavy industrial equipment during this period to buy cotton, leather, wool, rubber, etc. from abroad. Then we will have more cloth, leather shoes, and clothes. However, then we will have no tractor manufacturing industry, no automobile manufacturing industry, not much serious ferrous metal smelting industry, no metal to make machines, and as a result, we will be unarmed in the face of the encirclement of capitalist countries armed with modern technology. Then, we will have no possibility of supplying agriculture with tractors and various agricultural machines, and as a result, we will end up with no food. Then, we will not be able to defeat domestic capitalists, and as a result, we will greatly increase the chances of capitalist restoration. Then, we will not be able to have all the new-style national defense weapons, and our country's national independence will not be maintained, making our country a target for foreign enemies. Then, our position will be somewhat similar to the position China is in now, because China has no heavy industry of its own, no military industry of its own, and is trampled on by all willful people."
    (See "Problems of Leninism," Moscow Chinese Edition, pp. 503-504)

    Indeed, for more than a hundred years since the Opium War, our China has suffered enough from being trampled on by all willful people because we had no heavy industry of our own. Even today, American imperialism is still trying to make a comeback. Therefore, our primary task today must be to step up industrialization.

    The faster the industrialization of our country, the more beneficial it will be to the people.

    Under the premise of industrialization, our basic construction should first be for the development of machine manufacturing, electrical industry, ferrous metal smelting industry, non-ferrous metal smelting industry, fuel industries such as coal and petroleum, transportation industry, and agricultural machine manufacturing industry.

    Of course, this does not mean that we will not develop light industry. Light industry is necessary. Without light industry, we cannot fully supply the people with daily necessities, which means that we cannot directly guarantee the material welfare of the people. However, in our China, most of the light industry belongs to private capital, which has not only had a certain degree of development in the past, but also created conditions for its continued development due to the recovery of industrial and agricultural production and the gradual improvement of people's living standards over the past three years, as well as the increase in profits of many enterprises themselves. Heavy industry mainly belongs to state-owned industry, and its foundation was extremely weak in the past. It is also not easy to obtain profits, and it must concentrate a large amount of national funds, manpower, and technology to develop. Moreover, from the perspective of the role of production, light industry can only provide consumer goods, but cannot create means of production. Although heavy industry cannot directly provide consumer goods to the people, it can provide more production tools. All light industry and agriculture must rely on it to achieve further development. Therefore, the most urgent task for New China today is to develop heavy industry, and light industry can only be in a secondary position. Only by solving heavy industry first can we better develop light industry.

    Another extremely important task of industrialization is to transform agriculture and finally mechanize agriculture, which also requires heavy industry. Because only heavy industry can change backward agricultural production tools, and can organize countless scattered small farmers on the basis of large agricultural machines; only heavy industry can establish large-scale power stations and irrigation systems to transform the entire backward agricultural economy of China, and can lead farmers to the happy road. The Soviet Union's use of large-scale industry to transform agriculture has provided a good example for our country. Before the Soviet Union implemented industrialization, the productivity of agriculture was also not high. During the first five-year plan, because socialist industry had developed to the point where it could produce tractors and other agricultural machines in large quantities (of course, there were other reasons), farmers joined collective farms in large numbers between 1929 and 1930. By 1934, the number of farmers joining collective farms accounted for about three-quarters of the total number of farmers in the Soviet Union, and the sown area accounted for about 90% of the total sown area. By the completion of the second five-year plan in 1937, the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union was completed due to the continued high growth of productivity. At that time, the mechanization of the main labor process of agriculture had reached a very high degree. The mechanization of threshing was 94%, plowing 71%, and grain harvesting 84%. As a result of mechanization, grain yields increased from 7 quintals per hectare to 11.5 quintals during the Second Five-Year Plan alone. In 1937, the Soviet Union's grain output reached 6.8 billion poods, which was much more than the average annual harvest of 4.125 billion poods from 1910 to 1914 before the revolution. With the development of industry, the achievements of Soviet agriculture became higher and higher. This proves that it is impossible to transform agriculture without heavy industry.

    Now the prelude to large-scale economic construction in our country has begun. The economic recovery in the past three years has laid the foundation for future construction. Our country's large population, vast land, and the assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have prepared extremely favorable conditions for us. The most central issue at present is the issue of concentrating strength. We must overcome all conservative and backward ideas, concentrate the wisdom of the people of the whole country, and concentrate all human, financial, and material resources to invest in the great cause of industrialization.

    我们为什么必须走工业化的道路
    贺笠
    我国人民百余年来渴望的“工业化”，现在已经提到国家生活的日程上来了。这是我国人民最大的喜讯。
    毛主席在“论联合政府”中曾叙述过我国人民过去追求工业化的情景。他说：“在一个半殖民地的、半封建的、分裂的中国里，要想发展工业，建设国防，福利人民，招致国家的富强，多少年来多少人做过这种梦，但是一概幻灭了。许多好心的教育家、科学家、学生们不问政治，自以为可以所学为国家服务，结果也化成了梦，一概幻灭了。”
    中国共产党领导着全国人民，经过三十年来的牺牲奋斗，终于把幻梦变成了事实，使全国人民能够真正有机会来进行大规模的经济建设，这怎能不令人衷心祝贺呢！
    在条件成熟了的现在，我们不仅必须实现国家的工业化，而且必须加速工业化。毛主席早在抗日战争时期就曾经说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，没有人民的福利，没有国家的富强。”（见“论联合政府”）一个现代的国家如果没有强大的工业做基础，是不能生存的。
    要成为一个先进的工业国，工业在全部国民经济中要占很大的比重，而生产资料（主要是重工业）的生产在全部工业中亦必须超过生活资料的生产。如苏联在第一个五年计划完成国家工业化时（一九三三年初），工业产品在国民经济全部生产中的比重已增加到百分之七十（在一九一三年只占百分之四十二点一）。而生产工具和生产资料在全部大工业中的比重则由一九二九年的百分之四八·五增至百分之五十七。只有这样才能保证生产不断的增长。
    但是，我们说“工业化并不等于说要发展每一种工业。工业化的重心，它的基础，是在于发展重工业（燃料、金属等），是在于最后地制造生产手段的生产，是在于发展我们自己的机器制造业。”（见斯大林“关于苏联的经济地位”）根据斯大林指示的这一原理，我们在今后国家大规模的建设中，也必须不仅以工业建设为重点，而且轻工业还必须服从于重工业的发展。
    应该先发展轻工业呢或首先发展重工业？这是世界工业化的两条道路。先发展轻工业而后逐渐发展重工业，这是资本主义的道路。先建设重工业，而后发展轻工业，并在发展重工业的基础上改造农业，这是社会主义的道路。我们必须走社会主义的道路，而不能走资本主义的道路。原因是我们今天的条件与世界资本主义初期的条件不同，在十八、十九世纪，世界还没有什么帝国主义，各国资本主义可以得到充分自由发展。而自十九世纪末叶二十世纪初叶以来，国际帝国主义已经形成，并直接侵略全世界，谁要是慢慢发展，就只有便于帝国主义的侵略，最后终于得不到发展。“从轻工业入手”，这是帝国主义者常常对殖民地人民散播的谬论。如一九四三年美国总统罗斯福代表纳尔逊来华担任国民党政府经济顾问时，对中国经济的发展曾经作过这样的结论：“贫弱的中国诚需要建设，然从重工业入手，虽百年亦不能追踪美国，若从轻工业入手，十年以内立刻可以致富。”当时国民党就急忙照它的美国主子的意旨，由它的经济部设立了一个“纺织建设委员会”。走着一条殖民地的道路。现在新中国的人民是决不走这条道路的。
    我们的道路必须是一开始就发展重工业。列宁在“俄国革命五周年与世界革命底前途”中曾说：“要挽救俄国，单靠农民经济收成丰盛还不够，而且单靠供给农民消费品的轻工业情况兴旺也还不够，——我们还要有重工业。”“不挽救重工业，不恢复重工业，我们就不能建成任何工业，而没有工业，我们就根本不能维持我们之为独立国家的地位。”（见“列宁文选”下册，莫斯科中文版，第九八九页）斯大林在“第一个五年计划底总结”中也曾针对着那些反对建设重工业的人说道：“可是，必须知道，必须想一想，这种把工业化任务放在末位的政策能使我们得到怎样的结果。当然，我们能从这时期内耗费于重工业设备方面的十五万万金卢布中，拿出半数来向国外购买棉花、皮革、羊毛和橡胶等等。那时我们就会有更多的布匹、皮鞋和衣服。可是，那时我们就会没有拖拉机制造业，也没有汽车制造业，就会没有多少严重的黑金属冶炼业，就会没有金属来制造机器，结果也就会在拥有新式技术武装的资本主义国家包围面前陷于手无寸铁的状况。那时，我们就会没有可能用拖拉机和各种农业机器来供给农业，结果也就会落得没有粮食。那时，我们就会无法战胜国内资本主义分子，结果也就会大大增加资本主义复辟的机会。那时，我们就会不能有一切新式国防武器，而使我国底国家独立地位不能维持下去，使我国变成外敌用武的对象。那时，我们的地位就会与现在中国所处的地位多少相同，中国因为没有自己的重工业，没有自己的军事工业，而被一切逞性妄为的人所蹂躏着。”
    （见“列宁主义问题”、莫斯科中文版，第五○三—五○四页）
    的确，自鸦片战争开始一百多年来，我们中国由于没有自己的重工业曾被一切逞性妄为的人蹂躏得够受的。直到今天，美国帝国主义仍在企图卷土重来，因此，我们今天首要的任务就必须加紧工业化。
    我们国家工业化的速度越快，对于人民就越有利。
    在工业化的前提下，我们的基本建设，首先就要为了机器制造业、电气工业、黑色金属冶炼业、有色金属冶炼业、煤炭石油等燃料工业、运输工业、农业机器制造业等的发展。
    当然，这并不是说我们就不发展轻工业了，轻工业是必要的，没有轻工业就不能充分供应人民生活用品，这也就是说不能直接保证人民的物质福利。但是在我们中国大部轻工业都属于私人资本，不仅过去已有一定程度的发展，而且由于三年来工农业生产的恢复与人民生活水平的逐渐提高，许多企业本身利润的增涨，已为它造成继续发展的条件，而重工业主要属于国营工业，过去基础极为薄弱，又不易获得利润，必须大量集中国家资金、人力、技术才能得到发展。而且，从生产的作用来讲，轻工业只能提供消费品，而不能创造生产资料。重工业虽不能直接提供人民消费品，但它可以提供更多的生产工具，一切轻工业与农业都必须依靠它才能得到进一步的发展。因此，新中国今天的当务之急是发展重工业，轻工业只能居于次要地位。只有首先解决了重工业，才能更好地发展轻工业。
    工业化还有一个极其重要的任务是改造农业，最后并使农业机械化，这也非依靠重工业不可。因为只有重工业才能改变落后的农业生产工具，才能在大的农业机器基础上把无数零散的小农组织起来；也只有重工业，才能建立大规模的电力站及灌溉系统以改造整个中国这种落后的农业经济，才能将农民引向幸福的康庄大道。苏联利用大工业改造农业为我国提供了很好的范例。苏联在没有实行工业化以前，农业的生产力也是不高的。第一个五年计划期间，由于社会主义工业已经发展到能够大宗出产拖拉机和其他农业机器（当然还有其他原因），在一九二九年至一九三○年间农民就大批地加入集体农庄，到一九三四年加入集体农庄的农户已约占全苏联农户总数的四分之三，播种土地约占全部播种面积百分之九十。到一九三七年第二个五年计划完成，由于生产力的继续高涨，苏联的农业集体化就完成了。当时农业的主要劳动过程的机械化已达到很高的程度，打谷的机械化已是百分之九十四，耕耘百分之七十一，谷物收获百分之八十四。机械化的结果，谷物的收获量只在第二次五年计划时就已从每公顷七公担增加到十一点五公担。一九三七年苏联的谷物产量达到了六十八亿普特，较之革命前一九一○年至一九一四年每年平均只收四十一亿二千五百万普特要多得多。随着工业的发展，愈往后苏联农业的成就愈高。这证明要改造农业没有重工业是办不到的。
    现在我国大规模经济建设的序幕已经揭开了。三年来的经济恢复已为今后的建设打下了基础。我国人力的众多，土地的辽阔，与苏联及各人民民主国家的援助都为我们准备了极其有利的条件。目前最中心的问题就是集中力量的问题，我们必须克服一切保守思想与落后思想，把全国人民的智慧都集中起来，把一切人力财力物力都集中起来，投入工业化的伟大事业中去。
