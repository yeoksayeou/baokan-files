To the Editor: I am writing to you to report a problem: Currently, a serious situation of stagnant sales of sanitary oil has occurred in Shandong Province (Cottonseed oil that has been mechanically filtered is called sanitary oil. Sanitary oil is mainly for edible purposes and can also be used as a raw material for soap. - Editor).

I work at the Dongxing Oil Factory of the Dezhou Industrial Company. In order to solve the sales problem of sanitary oil, our factory sent people with official letters from the Dezhou Prefectural Administrative Office's Finance and Economics Committee to contact the North China Oils and Fats Company and the East China Oils and Fats Company multiple times, but the problem has not been resolved. According to the North China Oils and Fats Company, they do not have the task of purchasing from Shandong. The Tianjin Trust Company still has a large amount of sanitary oil produced by our factory in storage, and it cannot be sold. The sanitary oil produced by the Huimin Special District and other special district oil factories also cannot find a market. Therefore, this is a common problem in Shandong Province that urgently needs to be resolved.

Stagnant sales of products will inevitably affect capital turnover, thereby causing production to stop. For example, our Dongxing Oil Factory can produce 60,000 jin of sanitary oil per day, and we now have approximately 400,000 jin in stock. If the stagnant sales situation is not quickly broken, the oil factory will not be able to maintain production. We have consulted the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee, but no solution has been found. I suggest that the Central Ministry of Commerce consider resolving this issue; otherwise, it will be detrimental to the production and trade of vegetable oil in the future.

    建议中央商业部解决山东地区卫生油滞销问题
    编辑同志：我向你们反映一个问题：目前山东地区发生了卫生油滞销的严重情况（棉籽油经机器过滤后即称卫生油。卫生油主要是供食用，亦可作肥皂原料。——编者）。
    我在德州实业公司东兴油厂工作。我厂为了解决卫生油的销路问题，曾派人持德州专署财政经济委员会的公函与华北区油脂公司及华东区油脂公司联系多次，问题始终未得解决。据华北区油脂公司谈：他们没有向山东进行收购的任务。天津市信托公司现在还存有我厂出的大批卫生油，销售不出去。惠民专区及其他专区油厂出产的卫生油也同样找不到销路。因此，这是目前山东省普遍存在而迫切需要解决的问题。
    产品滞销必然会影响资金周转，从而造成生产的停顿。如我们东兴油厂每日可生产卫生油六万斤，现在已积压了四十万斤左右；如果不迅速打开滞销的局面，油厂就无法维持生产。我们曾向山东省人民政府财政经济委员会请示，也得不到解决。我建议中央商业部考虑解决这个问题；否则，对今后植物油业的生产和贸易都是不利的。
