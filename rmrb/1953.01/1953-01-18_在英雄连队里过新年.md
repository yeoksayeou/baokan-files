    Spending the New Year in a Heroic Company
  　Zhang Peng
    The New Year has arrived on the war-torn Korean front lines, and the soldiers are spending their third New Year in the Korean battlefield joyfully and tensely.

    A foot-thick layer of white snow covers the blackened shell craters, and the scorched mountains and forests appear particularly fresh after being draped in white snow. The tunnels, fortifications, and shelters are all covered in natural camouflage. On New Year's Eve, heavy snow fell again on the battlefield. Even the rumbling artillery fire from the front lines seemed distant and low.

    I spent the moment of transition between the old and new year in the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. When the hour and minute hands overlapped at 00:00, I heard the soldiers cheering. The sound was joyful and excited. I understand this company. In 1952, this company participated in six battles, including the recent battle in the Shangganling area; they annihilated more than two thousand enemies. In this company, there are many shining names. Squad Leader Cai Xinghai is a hero who recently emerged. In the Shangganling campaign, his squad blocked the enemy on the No. 9 position of Hill 597.9. At that time, he was the deputy squad leader. During the battle, he organized his forces well, repelling seven attacks by the enemy, ranging from a platoon to two companies in strength, and killing or wounding nearly four hundred enemies in one day. After the campaign, the squad was awarded a First-Class Merit, and Cai Xinghai was awarded a Special-Class Merit. His superiors are petitioning for him to be awarded the title of Hero.

    Special-Class Merit recipient, Second-Class Combat Hero, and Deputy Platoon Leader of the First Platoon, Zhang Xiangshan, performed meritorious service in the battle on the JinCheng front. At that time, he was the squad leader of the Second Squad. He and Wang Xueyan, the deputy platoon leader of the First Platoon, led the Second Squad and blocked the enemy on Position 56 for three days and three nights. This position was more than 1,000 meters away from the main position and served as a barrier for the main position. The enemy launched 69 consecutive attacks here with forces ranging from a company to two battalions, but they were all repelled by them. They annihilated more than 400 enemies. The entire squad was awarded a First-Class Merit and the title of "Second-Class Combat Hero Squad".

    The stretcher-bearer squad of this company is also a squad that has performed meritorious service. In the Shangganling campaign, six people rescued the codebooks for the entire company and were responsible for supplying ammunition to the entire company. The round trip from the forward positions to the battalion command post required traversing a five-kilometer-long blockade line, but none of them were injured or killed.

    The soldiers are brave and experienced, and many heroes have emerged in battle. Now there are more than sixty merit recipients in the entire company. Wang Wancheng and Zhu Youguang, heroes of the Yang Gensi type who have been posthumously awarded the Special-Class Merit, were young soldiers in the First Squad of this company.

    The New Year brings a special feeling of joy here. The pine branch arches decorated with red stars at the intersections, the red couplets at the entrances of the tunnels and shelters, the colorful special issues on the club bulletin boards, and the sounds of gongs and drums all make people feel the festive atmosphere.

    On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, the companies were exchanging New Year's cards. These are small works of art made by the soldiers themselves, some with doves of peace drawn on them, and some with airplanes and tanks. They all wrote things like: "Congratulations on even more brilliant victories in 1953." On New Year's Day, each company organized New Year's visiting teams, dancing, playing gongs and drums, and playing harmonicas to pay New Year's greetings to each other.

    On New Year's Day morning, everyone cooked dumplings, just like they do in the motherland. A feast was held in the afternoon, with twelve dishes plus a mixed soup. The first four dishes: shredded pork sausage, fried egg powder, preserved eggs, and fried peanuts, were served with wine. Each person drank an average of four liang of baijiu (white liquor) and a glass of wine. When it came to the meal, everyone ate fresh pork, beef, mutton, fish, and vegetables. Everyone also received a pack of cigarettes and half a catty of fruit candy. The soldiers spent the holiday joyfully.

    With candies, cigarettes, and peanuts on the table, the soldiers chatted intimately about their motherland and their beloved Chairman Mao while eating. Their faces were full of smiles, and their voices were filled with confidence and optimism. On New Year's Eve, I went to the Fourth Squad, and they were wrapping dumplings around the brazier. The dumplings were almost finished. Cai Xinghai patted the flour off his hands and quietly said to me: "We wrote a letter to Chairman Mao."

    "What did you write?"

    "We wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year and tell him—" As he spoke, he looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, a gift from the people's comfort delegation from the motherland: "Our determination to fight: We are determined to fight the enemy and win glory for the motherland."

    We chatted idly together. The soldiers said one after another:

    "How far are we from our motherland now? At least a thousand miles, right? But I always feel very close, like someone is standing behind me."

    "Everyone eats dumplings during the New Year in the motherland, and we also eat dumplings on the Korean battlefield. What's the difference from being in the motherland?"

    "Well, it's still different! Of course, everything is much better in the motherland. It would be terrible if the motherland were like Korea now!"

    The topic turned to the current situation, and everyone spoke even more enthusiastically. Cai Xinghai finally said: "In any case, we must never slacken or become complacent. We must never fail the trust of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. It seems that the enemy still wants to make a big deal out of it. There will be no good when Eisenhower, the war-monger, comes to power. Since he does not accept the lessons of failure, then we need to continue to teach him a good lesson. We have plenty of strength!"

    In my conversations with the heroes, I felt even more clearly that the soldiers had firm confidence in victory. On New Year's Day night, I chatted with Hou Yongxin in the Second Squad. This coal miner from northern Sichuan is now a First-Class Merit recipient in the company. Last June, in the battle to defend Position 56, he was stationed in the most prominent position. Six squads of enemies rushed up to him, bluffing and shouting, "Surrender," "Surrender." He angrily replied, "You son of a bitch, there are no surrenders, but there are explosive charges!" He threw down an explosive charge, blasting a group of enemies to pieces. Enemy grenades exploded continuously around him, and he was wounded in more than a dozen places, but he still persisted in the battle, throwing eighteen grenades at the enemy while lying in the communication trench. This strong miner said: "How much experience have we gained this year! I remember just after New Year's last year, when we were on the Jincheng front, our superiors asked our squad to hand over a 'live tongue.' Everyone was extremely determined, but we didn't have much experience. We ambushed in the snow in Gujili for half a month, freezing several feet. At that time, the enemy was the U.S. 24th Division, and they would send out a reinforced company at night. We only had two groups. As a result, we encountered the enemy, killed a dozen of them, but didn't capture a single one alive. But at that time, everyone thought it was pretty good! Looking at it now, that's nothing. In the Shangganling campaign, our company alone annihilated more than 1,100 enemies. Let them come again, our results will only be greater!"

    Second-Class Merit recipient Kang Peifang was originally a flour miller. In the battle in the Shangganling area, he threw out more than ten boxes of grenades by himself. He and another soldier lay in a shell crater, fighting for a day and repelling four enemy attacks. He despised the enemy very much and hated them. He said: "Don't look at the enemy bluffing, they are the most fragile and the most despicable. When I fought the enemy's last charge on the No. 3 position of Hill 597.9, I really couldn't bear to do it. You don't know how infuriating it was! They drove a group of newly captured soldiers—mostly old men and children, still wearing civilian clothes, just draped with bullet belts and holding rifles. The Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army forced them to charge in front. When fighting those enemies wearing helmets and shouting as they charged, I threw a high-explosive grenade at them and blew them to pieces, which was really satisfying and made me happy. But for these old people and children, I couldn't fight. My hand was soft. But, if I didn't fight, the devils would come up. I had to throw a grenade. I didn't throw an explosive charge, because that power is too great. I threw grenades with my hand, thinking, you guys better get down quickly. Later, I heard an enemy soldier groaning on the cliff below, crying very miserably. In the end, two of us went down, risking our lives, and carried him up. You see, the enemy's way of fighting is so despicable and vile! It would be strange if they didn't continue to fail!"

    At this moment, a burst of children's laughter came from outside the shelter. A group of Korean girls, holding the candies that the Volunteer Army uncles gave them for the New Year, skipped across the snow. Although it snowed on New Year's Eve, the sunlight on the first day of the New Year was so brilliant and glorious. The small pine forest covered with snow was like an orchard blooming with white flowers. The distant rolling hills shimmered with white light. The valley below the mountains was like a flat white felt. How beautiful the land is, how lovely the scenery is. This is the land that the heroes are protecting, and they will not allow wild beasts to trample it.

### 在英雄连队里过新年

    在英雄连队里过新年
  　张鹏
    新年来到了战火纷飞的朝鲜前线，战士们愉快而紧张地度过了朝鲜战场上的第三个新年。
    一尺多厚的白雪覆盖了污黑的弹坑，那被烧损了的山林，因为披上了白雪而显得格外清新。坑道、工事和掩蔽部都罩上了天然的伪装。新年前夕，战地上又飘起鹅毛大雪。前线的隆隆炮声，听来也似乎遥远而低沉了。
    我在志愿军某部八连里度过了那新旧年交替的时刻。当时针和分针在零点零分重叠在一起的时候，我听到了战士们的欢呼。那声音是愉快而又激动的。我了解这个连队。在一九五二年，这个连参加了六次战斗，包括最近上甘岭地区的战斗；先后歼灭了两千以上的敌人。在这个连里，有许多光辉的名字。四班长蔡兴海是最近才出现的英雄。在上甘岭战役中，他们班在五九七点九高地的九号阵地上阻击敌人。当时他是副班长。他在战斗中，很好地组织力量，一天中击退敌人一个排到两个多连兵力的七次攻击，杀伤敌人近四百名。战役结束后，这个班获一等功，蔡兴海获特等功，上级正为他们呈请英雄称号。
    特等功臣、二级战斗英雄、一排副排长张像山，是在金城前线的战斗中立功的。那时他是二班长。他和一排副排长王学言带领着二班，在五十六号阵地上阻击了敌人三天三夜。这个阵地远离主阵地一千多公尺，是主阵地的屏障。敌人以一个连到两个营的兵力向这里连续进攻了六十九次，都叫他们打退了。他们歼灭了四百多敌人。全班获得一等功，并荣获了“二级战斗英雄班”的称号。
    这个连的担架班，也是一个立功的班。在上甘岭战役中，六个人抢救了全连的彩号，负责供应全连的弹药。从前沿阵地到营指挥所，往返要穿过五里多长的封锁线，但他们没有一个伤亡。
    战士们又勇敢，又有经验，战斗中涌现了许多功臣。现在全连有六十多个功臣。已追赠为特等功臣的杨根思式的英雄王万成、朱有光，就是这个连的一班的青年战士。
    新年在这里给人带来了特别快乐的感觉。路口上饰着红星的松枝彩门，坑道和掩蔽部门口的红色对联，俱乐部墙报上的彩色特刊和响成一片的锣鼓声，都使人感受到节日的欢乐气氛。
    除夕的下午，连队都在互送着贺年片。这是战士们自制的小小的艺术品，有的在上面画着和平鸽子，有的在上面画着飞机和坦克。那上面都写着这样的话：“祝贺一九五三年的更辉煌的胜利。”元旦那天，各连都组织了拜年队，跳着舞，打着锣鼓，吹着口琴，互相拜年。
    元旦早晨，大家像在祖国一样，煮饺子吃。下午会餐，十二个菜，另外还有一个杂烩汤。前四个菜：肉丝香肠、油煎蛋粉、松花变蛋、炸花生米，是下酒菜。每人平均喝了四两白干和一杯葡萄酒。下饭的时候，大家吃到了新鲜的猪肉、牛肉、羊肉、鱼和青菜。每人又都发了一条香烟，半斤水果糖。战士们欢乐地度过了节日。
    桌上摆着糖果、香烟、花生米，战士们一边吃着，一边亲切地谈起了祖国，谈起了亲爱的毛主席，他们满面笑容，声调里充满了信心和乐观情绪。除夕，我到四班去，他们正围着火盆在包饺子。饺子就要包完了。蔡兴海拍掉手上的面粉，悄悄地对我说：“我们给毛主席写了一封信呢。”
    “写些什么？”
    “给毛主席拜年，告诉他老人家——”说着，他看了看贴在墙上的毛主席像，那是祖国人民慰问团带来的礼物：“我们的战斗决心：我们坚决打敌人，给祖国争光。”
    我们在一起闲扯。战士们你一言我一语地说道：
    “我们现在离祖国多远？起码有千把里吧！但我总感到近的很呢，就像是一个人站在我的身后一样。”
    “在祖国过年时，大家都吃饺子，在朝鲜战场上咱们也吃饺子。这和在祖国有什么不同。”
    “那还是不同呀！在祖国当然一切都要好得多。要是祖国跟现在的朝鲜一样，那可糟啦！”
    话题转到当前的形势上，大家发言又热烈起来。蔡兴海最后说道：“横竖我们绝不能够松懈麻痹。我们绝不能辜负祖国人民和毛主席的委托。看来敌人还想大搞。艾森豪威尔这个战争贩子上得台来，没有好事。他既不接受失败的教训，那我们就需要好好地继续教训他。我们有的是力量！”
    在与功臣们的谈话中，我更加明显地感到战士们有着坚定的胜利信心。元旦夜，我在二班和侯永信闲谈。这个川北的挖煤工人，现在是连里的一等功臣。去年六月，在坚守五十六号阵地的战斗中，他守在最突出的一个位置上。六个班的敌人冲到他的跟前，诈唬着：“缴枪”，“缴枪”，他愤怒地回答道：“格老子，缴枪的没有，缴爆破筒的有！”一个爆破筒投了下去，把一群敌人炸得稀烂。敌人的手榴弹在他身边不断地爆炸，他身上十几处负伤，但仍坚持战斗，躺在交通壕里还向敌人投出十八个手榴弹。这个坚强的矿工说道：“这一年来我们长了多少经验啊！记得去年新年刚过，那时我们在金城前线，上级叫我们班里交一个‘活舌头’。大家决心大极了，但是没有什么经验。在古直木里的雪地里，我们伏击了整整半月，冻坏了好几只脚。那时敌人是美军第二十四师，它夜里一出来就是一个加强连。我们呢，只有两个组。结果和敌人遭遇啦，打死了它十几个，活的可一个也没有捉住。但那时候，大家就认为不错哩！现在看来，那算什么呢。在上甘岭战役中，光咱这一个连，就歼灭了敌人一千一百多人。让它再来吧，我们的战果只会更大些！”
    二等功臣康培方，原先是个磨面粉的工人。在上甘岭地区的战斗中，他一个人摔出了十多箱手榴弹。他和另外一个战士一起伏在弹坑里，打了一天，击退了敌人的四次进攻。他非常卑视敌人，而且憎恶敌人。他说：“不要看敌人诈诈唬唬，它最脆弱，最卑鄙。我在五九七点九高地的三号阵地上打敌人最后一次冲锋时，真叫我不忍下手。你不知道那是多气人！他们赶上一群新抓来的兵——多半是老头和小孩，都还穿着便衣，只是披上了子弹带，掂着步枪。李承晚匪军逼着他们在前面冲锋。打那些头戴钢盔，吆喝着冲上来的敌人，我把一个高级手雷摔过去，炸它个稀巴烂，真够劲，心里高兴。但对于这些老人和小孩子，我不能打。我的手软。可是，不打鬼子就要上来。我只得投下手榴弹去。我没有投爆破筒，那威力太大。我手里投手榴弹，心里想你们赶紧下去就算啦。后来，我听见前面崖下有一个敌人彩号在呻吟，叫得真惨。我们最后下去两个人，冒着生命的危险，把他抬了上来。你看，敌人这样打法，是多么卑鄙和下贱呀！它不继续失败才有鬼！”
    这时，从掩蔽部的外面，传来了一阵儿童的笑声。一群朝鲜小女孩，抱着志愿军叔叔新年送给她们的糖果，跳跃着跑过雪地。除夕虽然落了雪，但新年第一天的阳光却是这样灿烂辉煌。披着积雪的小松树林，像是一片开着白花的果树。远处的波浪起伏的山岭，闪着皑皑的白光。山下的河谷像一张平展展的白毡。大地是多么美好，景色是多么可爱。这是英雄们卫护着的土地，他们是不容许野兽来践踏它的。
