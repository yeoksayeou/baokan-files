The ten female staff members of the Vanguard Theatre Troupe of the 64th Army of the North China People's Liberation Army demonstrated outstanding performance during the year-long Long March with the army. Last September, when the troops advanced from Gubeikou towards eastern Hebei, they marched for days in winding river gullies and sinking mud under continuous rain. They were soaked from head to toe, and their only pairs of shoes were ruined by the water. But this did not stop them from moving forward. When the soles separated from the uppers, they tied them with ropes and continued walking. Zhao Jian tied four ropes to one foot. Wang Shuqin's shoes were so damaged that they could not be repaired, so she walked barefoot. Neither illness, fatigue, nor the enemy's blockade could stop them. While climbing the eighty-li Xinglong Cliff Mountain, Chang Shunying developed boils on her thighs and could not walk. Jia Wenru helped her squeeze out the pus and then rushed to catch up with the troops. Last February, when passing through the Ping-Sui Railway, which was occupied by the enemy, they ran seven or eight li in one breath without falling behind, despite their weak bodies, just like the men. Male comrades often voluntarily helped them, and superiors often advised them to ride livestock. They sometimes accepted these suggestions and help, but often refused in many occasions, because they knew that everyone was struggling in the same difficult environment. On the march, they were often seen working diligently at the dressing stations and at the front lines. In the past year, the entire theater troupe performed forty to fifty plays, and they all undertook important work. Through their efforts and the efforts of the entire theater troupe, the story of "The White-Haired Girl" was unfolded before the eyes of the peasants, the story of "Blood and Tears" was unfolded before the eyes of the newly liberated soldiers, and the heroic deeds of countless cadres and soldiers were performed to re-educate them. Setting up mobilization booths to conduct propaganda and mobilization for the soldiers when passing through high mountains was a very hard work, but many heroines often competed to do this work. For example, Qi Huiping was very weak, but when crossing the thirty-li Nose Ridge south of Laiyuan, she firmly requested to work at the mobilization booth. Finally, she was allowed by the theater troupe leadership. She climbed the fifteen-li high mountain ridge, singing and shouting slogans to the marching troops, encouraging the soldiers. In May, when advancing eastward, Wang Huimin, Zhao Jian, Jia Wenru, and Guo Farui cooperated with twelve male staff members to form a literary and art work team and worked in the 191st Division of the army. Although they marched fifty or sixty li every day, they often performed for the soldiers, giving a total of sixteen performances in a month. Guo Su, the director of the division's political department, often said, "Your work is already an indispensable part of the political work!" In the army, they treated the wounded with the affection of brothers and sisters. In September, during the attack on the Ping-Sui Railway, all the female warriors of the theater troupe participated in nursing work. A wounded soldier was shot in the lower abdomen and had chapped lips and could not drink water. Comrade Jia Wenru used cotton swabs dipped in water to moisten his lips and reduce his pain. When the wounded were cold, they took off their cotton coats to cover them; when the wounded could not eat, they fed them bite by bite; when the wounded were carried on stretchers, they carried them one by one on their backs. No matter how tense the struggle, no matter how difficult the environment, no matter how weak their bodies, they still insisted on working. They often rushed to the front line to serve. When liberating Sanhe, before the fighting in the city was over, Wang Huimin, Zhao Jian, Guo Farui, and Qi Fenglian entered the city to publicize the policies of the Communist Party to the women. Of the ten female warriors who persisted in working on the front line, Wang Huimin, Zhao Jian, Jia Wenru, Qi Huiping, Guo Farui, Hu Ping, and Kang Huanyu were all Communist Party members. Wang Huimin, Jia Wenru, Zhao Jian, Guo Farui, and Qi Fenglian, and Wang Shuqin were commended for their meritorious service. All the female staff members were praised.

　　万里长征中的女战士
    华北人民解放军六十四军前卫剧社的十个女工作人员在过去一年随军的万里长征中，表现了出色的行动。去年九月，部队从古北口向冀东挺进，连日阴雨，她们在蜿蜒曲折的河沟和陷脚的泥泞的路上行进，她们混身上下都被雨淋湿了，脚上仅有的一双鞋子亦都被水泡坏了，但这并不能阻止她们的前进，鞋底与鞋帮分裂了，她们就用绳绑起向前走，赵健一只脚绑了四道绳；王书琴的鞋坏的不能修了，她就光着脚走。疾病疲劳与敌人的封锁也不能阻止她们。在爬八十里的兴隆崖大山时，常顺英大腿长脓疮走不动，贾文儒就帮她把脓挤掉，然后又向前赶上部队。去年二月，通过敌人盘踞着的平绥路时，她们的身体虽然弱，但和男人一样，一口气跑了七八里路未掉队。男战友经常自动地帮助她们，上级常劝她们骑牲口，她们有时也接受那些劝说和帮助，但在许多场合往往加以拒绝，因为她们知道大家一样是在艰苦环境中奋斗。在行军途中，绑札所里和火线上经常看见她们辛勤地工作着。在过去的一年中，全剧社共演剧四五十次，她们都担负了重要的工作。在她们与全剧社人员的努力下，把“白毛女”的故事展开在农民的眼前，把“血泪仇”的故事展开在新解放战士眼前，把无数干部战士英勇斗争的事迹演出来再教育他们。在通过高山时，建立鼓动棚，向战士们进行宣传鼓动，是很辛苦的工作，但许多女英雄常常争做这种工作。如齐惠萍身体很弱，在过涞源南上下三十里的鼻子岭时，她坚决要求到鼓动棚工作，最后被剧社领导方面允许了。她爬上了十五里高的大岭，向行进中的队伍唱歌喊口号，鼓励战士们。五月东进时，王惠敏、赵健、贾文儒、郭法瑞四人配合十二个男工作人员组成了一个文艺工作队，在该军一九一师工作，她们虽然每天行军五六十里，还经常为战士们演戏，一个月里共演出了十六次。师政治郭苏主任常说：“你们的工作已经是政治工作中不可少的一部分了！”在部队里，她们以兄弟姊妹的情谊敬待着伤员。九月出击平绥路，剧社全体女战士参加了护理工作。一个伤员小腹打伤了，嘴唇上起了皮，不能喝水，贾文儒同志用棉花蘸了水润湿他的嘴唇，减少了他的痛苦。伤员冷了，她们脱下棉袄给他们盖上；伤员不能吃饭，她们一口一口地喂他们；伤员上下担架，她们一个一个地背他们。不管斗争怎样紧张，不管环境怎样艰苦，不管她们身体怎样瘦弱，她们还是坚持工作。她们常争先恐后地到火线服务。解放三河时，城内战斗还没结束，王惠敏、赵健、郭法瑞、齐凤莲四人就进城去，向妇女群众宣传共产党的政策。她们——坚持前线工作的十个女战士中，王惠敏、赵健、贾文儒、齐惠萍、郭法瑞、胡平、康焕玉七人都是共产党员，王惠敏、贾文儒、赵健、郭法瑞、齐凤莲、王书琴立了功，全体女工作人员都受了表扬。（新华社华北七日电）
