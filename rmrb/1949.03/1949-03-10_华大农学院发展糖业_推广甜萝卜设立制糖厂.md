　　Huada Agricultural College Develops Sugar Industry
  　Promotes Sugar Beets, Establishes Sugar Factories
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to promote larger crop varieties (sugar beets), increase production, and develop the sugar industry in North China, Huada Agricultural College has formed a promotion team of seventeen people. Under the direct leadership of Gao Huimin, Director of the Agronomy Department, and Yang Dan, Director of the Preparatory Class, the team has gone to villages such as Shijiazhuang, Dongxi Village, Dongbeijiao, and Gaozhu to promote and organize the masses to plant sugar beets. According to incomplete statistics from four days, over 60 mu have already been sown. The Agricultural College is responsible for technical guidance.
    [Another Report] The Agricultural College has already established eleven sugar factories for the masses in the Taihang area and six in the Taiyue area. It has also taught the masses to produce brown sugar and a small amount of white sugar. To date, 300,000 jin of brown sugar has been produced, and waste molasses can be used to manufacture alcohol. Initially, when Huada Agricultural College promoted sugar beets in Qinyuan and Anze areas of the Taiyue region, the masses did not believe they could be boiled into sugar and their enthusiasm was low. Some places even had many missing seedlings. It wasn't until the beets were harvested and grew very large, such as in Hecuan, where one mu yielded around 4,000 to 5,000 jin, and in Zhongyudian, where 8,300 jin of beets yielded 670 jin of sugar and 456 jin of molasses, averaging about 8 jin of sugar and 5 jin of molasses per 100 jin of beets, that the farmers believed they could truly produce sugar. They saw that it was much more profitable than growing ordinary crops. For example, a farmer in Gouli said, "We will build houses and open sugar factories next year, and prepare for large-scale production." An old man from Wangtao Village said, "I am seventy or eighty years old this year, and I have never seen us make our own sugar. The Communist Party is truly working for the people, and we have learned to make sugar ourselves!" Currently, the local masses are actively planning to plant sugar beets.

　　华大农学院发展糖业
  　推广甜萝卜设立制糖厂
    【本报讯】华大农学院为了推广作物较大的品种（糖萝卜）增加生产，并发展华北糖业，由十七人组成一个推广小队，在农艺系主任高惠民、预备班主任杨丹直接领导下，分赴石家庄、东西村庄、东北焦、高柱等村。进行宣传与组织群众种植甜萝卜，据四天的不完全统计，已有六十余亩播种。技术上由农学院负责指导。
    【又讯】农学院在太行已为群众设立了砂糖厂十一处，在太岳设立六处，并已教会群众制造出红砂糖，及少量的白糖，截至目前止已出产红砂糖三十万斤，并能用废糖蜜制造火酒。华大农学院在太岳区沁源、安泽一带推广甜萝卜，起初群众不相信能够熬成砂糖，情绪不高，有些地方缺苗很多，一直等到收了萝卜，而且长得很大，如和川一亩地收四千斤到五千斤左右，在中峪店用八千三百斤萝卜熬出六百七十斤砂糖，及四百五十六斤糖蜜，平均每百斤可熬砂糖八斤左右及五斤糖蜜，这时农民相信真正能出砂糖了，看到比种普通庄稼有利的多。如沟里农民说：“咱明年要盖房子，开糖厂，准备大搞。”王陶村一个老汉说：“我今年活到七八十岁了，还没见过自己造糖，共产党真心为老百姓，咱自己也学会造糖了！”现当地群众正纷纷酝酿种甜萝卜。
