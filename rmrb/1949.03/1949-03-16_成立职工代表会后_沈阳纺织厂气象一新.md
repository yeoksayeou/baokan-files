Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 14th: Since the state-owned Shenyang Textile Factory established a workers' representative council in early January, the atmosphere has been completely renewed. The Workers' Representative Council is an organization of the factory's administrative system. The factory director is the ex officio chairman of the representative council. Under the leadership of the Factory Management Committee, the representative council specifically discusses, arranges, and thoroughly disseminates all administrative decisions and plans to the workers, mobilizing the vast number of workers to strive to achieve these decisions and plans. The Factory Management Committee can absorb the correct opinions of workers through the representative council and revise some decisions that are not entirely practical. The representatives who make up the Workers' Representative Council are elected from the workers' groups. Groups are divided according to production units, with one representative elected for each group of 30 people or less, and two representatives elected for each group of 40 people or more. Currently, there are a total of 37 representatives participating in the Workers' Representative Council. Each group also elects four officers who, under the leadership of the representative, are responsible for production within the group, assisting in administrative work such as study, cultural entertainment, and welfare. They are also the ex officio officers of the various departments of the trade union. Before the establishment of the Workers' Representative Council, because there were only eight employee representatives participating in the Factory Management Committee, it was difficult to broadly reflect the opinions and demands of all workers, and the factory rarely received the help of the workers, so workers' participation in factory management was almost a formality. After the establishment of the Workers' Representative Council, on the one hand, the factory can listen to the opinions of the workers on factory management, production plans, wage issues, and other work through the Workers' Representative Council, and transmit and implement them through the representatives; on the other hand, the workers have also strengthened their sense of ownership because of the representative council, not only actively producing themselves, but also caring about the entire factory's production. Each workers' group automatically holds a production review meeting every Saturday. Workers Zhai Dechang, Li Jiabao, and more than a dozen others wrote down their experiences in scutching, winding, and other labor, and published them in the Workers' Daily to introduce them to other workers. The workers' production enthusiasm has been greatly improved, and the output has increased greatly. For example, the output of 16-count yarn, the average amount of yarn produced by each spindle within 10 hours, was 0.373 pounds in December last year, and increased to 0.44 pounds in January. The output of cloth, the average number of yards produced by each machine per shift, was 28.99 yards in December last year, and increased to 44 yards in January. The number of worker absences has also decreased from 20% to 8%. No one was absent on New Year's Eve, and they went to work on time after the New Year. According to an engineer who understands the past situation of the factory, this is a phenomenon that has not occurred in the factory for many years. Because the officers elected from the workers' groups are also the ex officio officers of the various departments of the trade union, and are also under the leadership of the various departments of the trade union, the work of the trade union can be carried out through the Workers' Representative Council to mobilize the vast number of workers. In the past, the trade union cadres of the factory ran around all day sweating profusely, but in the end they couldn't do anything. Now the situation has changed greatly. The trade union cadres don't have to do everything themselves, and the workers themselves arrange everything in an orderly manner. The workers automatically put out blackboards every day, and also organized literacy classes, actively carrying out activities such as writing articles, literacy, singing, acting, and ball games. Every day after work, the trade union office is crowded with people, truly becoming a place for workers' activities.

### 成立职工代表会后　沈阳纺织厂气象一新

　　成立职工代表会后
  　沈阳纺织厂气象一新
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】公营沈阳纺织厂自从一月初成立了职工代表会以来，气象为之一新。职工代表会是工厂行政系统的组织。厂长是代表会的当然主席。代表会在工厂管理委员会领导之下，将行政上一切决定与计划，加以具体讨论、布置、深入传达到工人中去，动员广大工人，努力实现这些决定与计划。工厂管理委员会可以通过代表会吸收工人正确的意见，修正某些不完全切合实际的决定。组成该职工代表会的代表，是从工人小组里选举出来的。小组按生产单位划分，三十人以下为一组，四十人以上为两组，每组选举代表一人。现参加职工代表会的代表共有三十七人。各小组内又选出干事四人，在代表领导下分别负责组内之生产，协助行政上工作中学习、文化娱乐、福利等工作，他们同时又是职工会各部的当然干事。在没有建立职工代表会以前，因为参加工厂管理委员会的职工委员只有八名，很难广泛地反映全体工人的意见与要求，厂方很少得到工人群众的帮助，所以工人参加工厂管理差不多流于形式。在成立了职工代表会以后，一方面厂方对于工厂管理、生产计划、工资问题等工作，能够通过职工代表会来听取工人的意见，并通过代表来传达执行；另一方面，工人也因为有了代表会而加强了主人翁的感觉，不仅自己积极生产，并且关心整个工厂的生产。每个工人小组自动地在每星期六开一次生产检讨会。工人翟得昌、李家保等十余人，把自己在清花、摇线等劳作中得到的经验写成稿子，登到工人报上，介绍给其他工人。工人生产积极性大大提高，产量大增。如十六支纱的产量，平均每个锭子在十小时以内出的纱，去年十二月份为零点三七三磅，一月份就增加到零点四四磅。布的产量，平均每班每台机器去年十二月份为二十八点九九码，一月份就增加到四四码。工人缺工数也由百分之二十减至百分之八。在旧历除夕时也没有人缺工，过年后也按时上班。据了解该厂过去情形的一位工程师说，这是该厂多年来所没有过的现象。因为工人小组里选出的各干事同时又是职工会各部的当然干事，又受职工会各部的领导，这样，就使职工会的工作得以通过职工代表会而发动广大的工人群众去做。过去该厂工会干部一天到晚跑得满头大汗，结果什么也做不了，现在情形就大为转变。职工会干部用不着什么事都自己动手，工人自己便把一切安排得头头是道。工人每天自动出黑板报，又组织了识字班，积极进行写稿、识字、唱歌、演戏及球类比赛等活动。每天一下班，工会办公室里就挤满了人，真正成为工人活动的场所。
