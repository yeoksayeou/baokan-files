　　"Print the Party Newspaper Quickly and Well"!
    A Snapshot of the Production Competition Movement at the Newspaper's Second Printing Plant
    Dé Shùn, Liú Wēi
  (1) Before the Movement
    Last October, under a series of circumstances including war preparations, resumption of work, and compensation for war losses, the work system of each production department in our newspaper's printing plant was unsound, unclear, and characterized by sluggish and undisciplined work. For example, the arrangement of newspapers and other printed materials did not distinguish between urgency, and the publication time of the newspaper was not guaranteed. The quality of printing was also not good enough. Readers had returned poorly printed newspapers to us two or three times, raising criticisms. Furthermore, due to inconsistencies in the work and living habits of some employees, there was some friction among individual comrades, even affecting their work morale. For example, one comrade could not find a screw when installing a machine, and later found it elsewhere, suspecting sabotage. In the relationship between printing and distribution, the number of newspapers printed often contained errors due to an insufficiently unified system. Coupled with the lack of a good meeting and inspection system, the publication and distribution of the Party newspaper was not well guaranteed, causing some unnecessary losses in work.
    (2) Establishing Systems and Launching the Production Competition Movement
    Around December, in response to the above situation, the leadership organized a review of publishing and distribution work, criticized the erroneous understanding of some comrades who attributed delays to objective conditions such as the rural environment, poor tools, and inadequate technology. It determined to strengthen the sense of responsibility of employees for the publication of the Party newspaper, strengthen political study, and establish various work systems. It called for launching a production competition movement, proposing the policy of "institutionalizing the work system for guaranteeing newspaper publication, standardizing quality, and making learning regular." Under this call, each department conducted specific discussions and formulated guarantee plans for production teams and individuals, implementing a time registration system for the publication process. In this way, the publication time of the newspaper has been basically guaranteed in the past two months. Because it caught the train schedule, the newspaper was distributed one day earlier. In addition to the improvement of production organization, the increase in production volume in each workshop also relatively shortened the time. For example, the efficiency of plate casting was shortened from the standard time of ten minutes per plate to seven minutes, and finally even reached five minutes. The printing speed increased from the standard of 800 impressions per hour to 1,054 impressions, and then to 1,168 impressions. The standard time for platemaking was 30 minutes each time, which was shortened to only 20 minutes, and then reduced to 17 minutes. For example, the casting team increased from a standard of 20,000 characters per shift to more than 30,000 characters. The Wang Shuzeng team even achieved a production record of 40,800 characters, thus completing 38 days of tasks in 29 days. In the urgent task of making zinc plates, the plate-making team originally planned to complete 880 square inches of zinc plates in 19 days, but they were made in 15 days. Teams such as binding, typesetting, engraving, and carpentry also worked day and night, doing work as soon as it came, completing the scheduled tasks without complaint.
    In terms of quality, the implementation of the newspaper's proofreading system and printing symbol system (that is, making a secret mark on their own printed newspaper) strengthened the sense of responsibility of the workers, as there was a basis for checking the quality of newspaper printing afterwards. The proofreading has formed a mass movement. For example, Jiang Xueting, a machine trainee, found that the title of the newspaper mistook "agriculture" (农业) as "agricultural industry" (业农); many comrades could do this and found and corrected many errors. For example, the glue-boiling comrade, because the wind was blowing in winter, and the rubber skin was hard and difficult to use, took the initiative to improve the glue cellar in time, so that the printing quality was not affected. In this movement, we no longer heard the post office and readers constantly making suggestions to the printing plant as in the past.
    In terms of material saving, the printing team used Xuan paper, which consumed more than ten sheets per thousand impressions before the movement, while in the movement, although the consumption of 0.8% per thousand impressions was specified, it was not exceeded at the time of the summary. In December, the whole team saved 3,868 sheets of paper, and in January, 7,022 sheets (each sheet was priced at 250 yuan of Jicha, totaling 1,755,500 yuan of Jicha). It was originally stipulated that the money saved would be divided into dividends. Due to the gradual improvement of everyone's political awareness during the movement, they voluntarily proposed to reduce the share, and even at the commendation meeting, comrades such as Li Huanxin and Cao Longquan took the lead in donating all the remaining paper in January to the public, and the whole team followed suit. Comrades such as Cao Degui and Cheng Shuying enthusiastically took out their heating fees to support the front line. In the plate-casting team, the comrades used the burnt coke to smother the fire, saving the firewood used for daily fire, saving a lot.
    The establishment of these systems, the increase in the enthusiasm of the workers, and the fullness of the production enthusiasm have transformed work, life, and study into a tense movement. In the two-month movement, two model printing teams emerged, and the red flags of "Prioritize Quantity and Quality" and "Production Model" were awarded at the summary meeting; there were a total of 25 production models in various aspects, including Li Huanxin, Zhou Qiansuo, Jiao Yiming, Liu Sanbao, Wang Shuzeng, and Wang Chouzi, 6 people were awarded honorary awards, and model employees accounted for about one-third of the total number of employees in the factory. Under the active leadership and mutual influence of general comrades, the production and publishing tasks were gloriously completed.
    (3) Glimpses of Experience
    The experience the printing plant has gained from obtaining these remarkable achievements is:
    First, the establishment and implementation of the system is a major key to ensuring the effective guarantee of publishing work. Because the newspaper publishing production process is complicated, coupled with the scattered rural residences, if there is no sound production process registration system, standard output time registration system for each department, and report collection and delivery system, quality symbol system, etc., the newspaper will often be delayed and erroneous. I can't find out the responsibility, and everyone has their own reasons. The establishment of these systems, on the one hand, cleared away the past confusion, and the responsibilities of each department were clear. When problems were found, they could be traced back to the responsibilities at any time and corrected in time. On the other hand, it invisibly promoted the work competition among departments and comrades within each team, and no one wanted to fall behind.
    Second, the democratic style in production leadership is a powerful weapon for improving work and increasing production. In the early stage of the movement and during the movement, the establishment and improvement of all systems, the specification of the standard quantity of production and saving, the division of labor of the team leaders, the relationship between departments, etc., were all carried out after ideological brewing with the team leaders and activists, and then necessary meetings were held to discuss implementation. This approach not only makes it easier to solve problems, but also promotes the high sense of ownership of every employee. Therefore, in their work, they can actively and actively find ways to overcome difficulties and complete tasks. And promote mutual unity and eliminate some past estrangement.
    Third, timely inspection and summary are good ways to continuously promote and improve the movement. In these two months of movement, a semi-monthly summary work was consciously carried out. In each summary, the various production volumes and speeds were registered, as well as the exemplary actions of each comrade in completing the production tasks (these materials were organized and collected by the production competition committee of each department, and published in the wall newspaper) were all compiled and analyzed, compared, and given praise and encouragement at the general meeting. And grasp the spirit of more praise and less criticism. Criticism also focuses on typical examples, exposing them and alerting everyone. As a result, the work is continuously improved, the shortcomings are gradually eliminated and corrected, and it becomes the driving force of the movement.
    The shortcomings of this movement are that the conscious cultivation of activists has not been done enough, and the learning work has also shown a lack of persistence. The branch and the trade union's full cooperation with production and learning is not enough. These are all to be improved in the future.

　　“把党报印的又快又好”！
    本报第二印刷厂生产竞赛运动缩影
    德顺　刘威
  （一）运动以前
    去年十月本报印刷厂在备战、复工、补偿战争损失一连串的情况下，各个生产部门的工作制度，是在不健全、不明确、工作拖拉自流等状态中。如报纸与其他印刷品布置时不分缓急，报纸出版时间无保证。质量上也印得不够好，读者曾有两三次给我们退回印坏的报纸，提出指责意见。又由于有些职工工作生活习惯不一，引起了某些个别同志相互不融洽，甚至影响了他们的工作情绪，如某同志按装机器，螺丝找不着了，后在其他地方发现，怀疑是别人捣鬼。印刷与发行关系上，也因制度不够统一，报纸印刷份数常常出错，再加平时没有很好的会议检查制度，致使党报的出版发行得不到很好的保证，造成了工作上一些不必要的损失。
    （二）树立制度开展生产竞赛运动
    十二月前后，领导上针对以上情况，组织了出版和发行工作的检讨，批判了某些同志把迟误原因推在农村环境、工具不好、技术不高等客观情况的错误认识，确定了从发动职工对党报出版的责任感，加强政治学习，建立各种工作制度等方面内容，号召开展生产竞赛运动，提出“保证报纸出版的工作制度化，质量标准化，学习经常化”的方针，各部门在这一号召下都进行了具体讨论，并拟定了生产组与个人的保证计划，执行了出版过程时间登记制，这样两月来报纸出版时间，才基本上得到保证，因为赶上了火车班次，使报纸提前了一天发行。这点除生产组织的改进外，各工作间生产量的提高，也相对的缩短了时间。如浇版效率由标准时间每块十分钟，缩短为七分钟，最后甚至达到五分钟。印刷速度，由每时八百印标准，增到一千零五十四印，继而增到一千一百六十八印。上版时间每次标准为三十分钟，缩短到仅用二十分钟，后又减到十七分钟。又如铸造股，由每班两万字标准，增到三万多字，王树增班甚至达到四万零八百字的生产记录，因此三十八天的任务，二十九天完成。制版股在赶制紧急任务中，原定十九天完成八百八十方英寸的锌版，在十五天中就制成了。装订、排字、刻字、木工等股，亦不分昼夜，工作随来随干，没有怨言地完成了规定任务。
    在质量上，由于实行了报纸的大样检查制和印刷符号制（即在自己的印刷报上，作一暗记号），使报纸印刷好坏，事后有检查根据，因而加强了工友同志的责任感。大样的检查，形成了群众性的运动，如机器练习生江雪亭同志，发现报纸标题把“农业”二字误为“业农”；好多同志都能如此做到，发现改正不少错误。又如熬胶同志，因冬季刮风，胶皮发硬不好用，即主动及时地改善了放胶的地窑，使印刷质量不受影响。在这一运动当中，再没有听到邮政局和读者象过去那样给印刷厂不断的提出意见了。
    材料节约方面，印刷股使用轩纸，在运动前每千印消耗在十张以上，而在运动中，虽规定了千分之八的消耗量，到总结时，不但没有超过，在十二月份中，全股还节约纸张三千八百六十八张，一月份节约七千零二十二张（每张市价二百五十元冀钞，共折合冀钞一百七十五万五千五百元），原规定这些节约下的钱实行分红制，由于运动中、大家政治觉悟逐渐提高，自动提出少分，甚至在立功小结会上，李焕新、曹龙泉等同志争先恐后地把一月份节余纸张全部献公，全股随之响应。曹德贵、程书英等同志，更热情地把烤火费拿出支援前线。在浇版股里，同志们用烧过的焦炭闷火，省掉每日所用生火干柴，节约不少。
    这些制度的树立，职工工作积极性的提高，生产热情的饱满，使工作、生活、学习都转入紧张的运动中。两个月的运动，涌现了两个印刷模范班，总结会上赠给了“量质占先”、“生产模范”的红旗；各方面的生产模范共有李焕新、周千锁、焦义明、刘三保、王树增、王丑子等二十五名，得名誉奖者六名，模范职工约占全厂人数三分之一。一般同志都在他们积极带头互相影响下，光荣地完成了生产出版任务。
    （三）点滴经验
    前面这些显著成绩的获得，印刷厂摸索到的经验是：
    第一、制度的建立与贯彻，是使出版工作得到有力保证的一个主要关键。因为报纸出版生产过程繁多，加上农村住地分散，如果没有一个健全的生产过程登记制度、各部门标准产量时间登记制度以及取报交牌制、质量符号制等，往往报纸受到迟误和错误时，查不出责任，各说各有道理。这些制度的建立，一方面扫除了过去的糊涂帐，各部门责任分明，发现问题时，随时能找出责任，及时纠正。另一方面，无形中促成了部门之间及各股内部同志们的工作竞赛，谁也不愿落后。
    第二、生产领导中的民主作风，是改进工作、增加生产的有力武器。在运动的初期和运动中，凡是制度的建立和改进，生产、节约标准数量的规定，股长的分工，部门之间的关系等等，都是事先经过和各股长、积极分子的思想酝酿才进行必要的会议，讨论实施。这样做法，不仅问题容易解决，并发扬了每个职工同志高度的主人翁感觉。所以在工作中，能主动、积极地设法克服困难完成任务。并促使相互团结，消除了以往的一些隔阂。
    第三、按时检查和小结，是不断推动和提高运动的很好方法。在这两个月的运动中，即有意识地进行了每半月一次的小结工作，在每次小结中，把各种生产量及速度登记，以及每个同志在完成生产任务中的模范行动（这些材料，是由各部门生产竞赛委员组织采访收集，并写出刊登墙报）都一一统计汇集起来，在全体会上有分析、有比较地给以表扬和鼓励。并且掌握了多表扬，少批评的精神。批评亦着重典型事例，予以揭发，警惕大家。由此，使工作不断改进，缺点逐渐消除和纠正，成为运动的推进力。
    这次运动的缺点，就是有意识的培养积极分子做得不够，学习工作还表现了虎头蛇尾，支部和工会对生产、学习全力的配合还嫌不够等，这都是有待今后改进的。
