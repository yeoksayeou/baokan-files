Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to a TASS dispatch from London: The British House of Commons is scheduled to debate the National Defense Bill on March 3rd. British Communist MPs Gallagher (formerly translated as Gallacher) and Piratin announced that they will submit a resolution to the House of Commons representing the will of the British working people, demanding that the Labour government abandon the arms race and stop wasting expenditure on rearmament. The resolution points out: "Transforming foreign policy into a policy of friendship with the Soviet Union can reduce the money and manpower spent on the military (a total of 1,539,000 men and women currently serving in the British military) by half, and use them to improve the lives of ordinary people."
    Note: According to the White Paper published by the British government on February 15th, the total defense expenditure for the British fiscal year 1949-50 is estimated at £759,860,000, an increase of more than £67 million compared to the previous year (£692,660,000), i.e., an increase of 8%. However, the actual increase in military expenditure is likely to be greater than the above figures, as certain items, such as fulfilling military obligations, are not included in this year's estimates.

　　英共议员加拉赫等宣布
  　要求政府放弃军备竞赛
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国下院定于三月三日辩论国防法案。英国共产党议员加拉赫（前译加拉彻）与皮拉丁宣布，他们将向下院提出一个代表英国劳动人民意愿决议案，要求工党政府放弃军备竞赛，终止在重整军备上浪费开支，议案指出：“转变外交政策成为对苏友好的政策，可使花费在军事上的金钱和人力（英国现役男女军人共一百五十三万九千人）减少一半，而将它们用来改善老百姓的生活。”
    按：据英国政府二月十五日发表的白皮书估计：一九四九——五○年英国财政年度的国防经费总数为七亿五千九百八十六万镑，比前一年（六亿九千二百六十六万镑）增加了六千七百余万镑，即增加了百分之八。但军事费用的实际增加，当较上述数字更大，因为某些项目，例如履行军事义务等，并未列入本年度的估计之内。
