　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 7th, Electric News Agency, Prague: "To wage a difficult struggle against the remnants of the bourgeoisie, against the reactionaries who are unwilling to surrender and continue to try to restore the capitalist slavery system," this is the powerful call of the Czech Communist Party Central Executive Committee's letter to the two million members of the Czech Communist Party, published in the Czech Communist Party Central Organ "Red Power" on March 4. The letter to party members emphasized: Until now, everything has indicated that the struggle for socialism does not, in fact, mean any easing of the struggle between the exploiting classes and the new progressive labor force. Since February 1948, the reactionaries have lost their positions and changed their tactics of open political struggle. The reactionaries have gone underground, carrying out sabotage, terrorist activities, and espionage activities. "In their activities, the reactionaries blatantly pin their hopes on wars against their country and nation, and on wars waged by imperialists." The letter to party members declared: The reactionaries' speculation in war is futile, because the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of warmongers. In order to guarantee the victorious defense of socialism, it is necessary to wage a difficult struggle against the remnants of the bourgeoisie, to strengthen and organize planned economy, and to improve state organs, especially the army and state security organs, so as to make them absolutely reliable tools in the anti-capitalist struggle.

　　捷共号召二百万党员
    向资产阶级残余坚决斗争
    保证胜利地保卫社会主义
    【新华社陕北七日电】电通社布拉格讯：“向资产阶级的残余，向不愿投降而继续力图使资本主义奴役制度复辟的反动分子进行艰苦的斗争”，这是三月四日捷克共产党中央机关报“红色权力”报刊登的捷共中央执委会告捷共二百万党员书的有力号召。这个告党员书强调指出：至今，每一件事情都指明，争取社会主义的斗争，事实上并不意味着剥削阶级与新的进步劳力之间的斗争有任何缓和。自从一九四八年二月以来，反动派失去了阵地，便改变了公开的政治斗争策略。反动派已转入地下，进行破坏、恐怖行动与谋报活动。“反动分子在其活动中，明目张胆地将其希望寄托在反对其国家与民族的战争上，寄托在帝国主义者所进行的战争上。”该告党员书宣称：反动派在战争方面的投机是徒劳无益的，因为和平的力量是比战争贩子的力量强大。为了保证胜利地保卫社会主义，必须对资产阶级的残余进行艰苦的斗争，必须加强与组织计划经济，需要改进国家机构，特别是军队及国家保安机关，以便使其成为反资本主义斗争中绝对可靠的工具。
