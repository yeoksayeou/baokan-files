　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS reports: The UN Economic and Social Council concluded its discussion on the issue of infringements on trade union rights raised by the World Federation of Trade Unions on the 10th. During the discussion, Soviet representative Soloviev delivered a lengthy speech, pointing out that the ruling groups of capitalist countries are doing their utmost to stifle free trade unions and are creating pseudo-trade union organizations that obey them, so that their leaders implement the policies of the capitalist ruling groups and bind the hands and feet of the trade union movement. This situation can now be seen in many capitalist countries, especially the United States. The Taft-Hartley Act is one of the most vivid examples of such reactionary anti-trade union legislation. The reactionary American monopoly capitalists are carrying out this attack on trade union rights and freedoms with the assistance of reactionary American trade union leaders, especially senior leaders of the American Federation of Labor. As is well known, the leadership of the AFL has long become a branch of Wall Street for suppressing free and democratic movements. Soloviev continued: The Soviet delegation believes that the issue of infringement of trade union rights submitted to the Economic and Social Council for discussion is of great fundamental importance. For this reason, the Soviet delegation proposes that the Economic and Social Council should pay attention to the World Federation of Trade Unions' memorandum on the persecution suffered by trade union organizations in various countries. At the same time, it declares that the legislative, administrative, and other measures taken in countries such as Argentina, Burma, Brazil, Cuba, Greece, Egypt, India, Iran, Spain, Lebanon, Portugal, Chile, and the Union of South Africa are in violation of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet delegation recommends that the aforementioned member states of the United Nations effectively and promptly implement the principles regarding trade union rights published by the various agencies of the United Nations, and recommends that these countries submit reports to the ninth session of the Economic and Social Council on the measures they have taken in implementing this resolution. However, under the control of the American and British bloc "majority," the Economic and Social Council rejected the Soviet Union's just proposal and adopted the vague proposal put forward by the New Zealand representative, which drew the attention of United Nations member states to the importance of trade union rights.

　　联合国经社理事会上
  　苏代表发表演说
    斥责英美等国窒息自由工会
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社讯：联合国经济社会理事会已于十日结束了世界工联所提关于侵犯职工会权利问题的讨论。在讨论过程中，苏代表索洛维耶夫发表长篇演说，指出资本主义各国的统治集团竭力窒息自由职工会，并制造服从他们的伪职工会组织，使它们的领袖奉行资本家统治集团的政策，束缚职工运动的手足。现在，在许多资本主义国家首先是美国，可以看到这样的情况。塔夫脱——哈特莱法案就是这种反动的反职工会立法的最生动的例子之一。反动的美国垄断资本家对职工会权利和自由进行这一进攻时，是受到美国反动的职工会领袖们特别是劳工联合会高级领导人物的协助的。如所周知，劳联的领导机构很久以来就变成华尔街镇压自由民主动员会的分店。索洛维耶夫继称：苏联代表团认为提交经社理事会讨论的侵犯职工权利问题，具有重大原则上的重要性，为此，苏联代表团提议经社理事会应注意世界工联关于各国职工会组织所遭受的迫害的备忘录。同时声明；阿根廷、缅甸、巴西、古巴、希腊、埃及、印度、伊朗、西班牙、黎巴嫩、葡萄牙、智利和南非联邦等国内采取的立法行政及其他方面的措施，是违反联合国宪章的。苏联代表团建议上述各联合国会员国有效地和尽早地实行联合国各机构公布的关于职工会权利的原则，并建议这些国家向经社理事会第九次会议提出关于它们在执行本决议时所采取的措施的报告。但在美英集团控制“多数”的情况下，经社理事会却否决了苏联的正义提案，而通过了纽西兰代表所提的含糊的议案，即提起联合国会员国注意职工会权利的重要性。
