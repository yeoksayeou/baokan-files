　　Jinzhong Electric Dispatch: The Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory and Jinzhong Trading Company have established a unified purchase and sales agreement. Last winter, these two state-owned enterprises engaged in competitive purchasing of raw cotton in the Pingyao, Fenyang, and Jiaocheng areas. As a result, the quality of cotton purchased was poor, forcing the factory to spin whatever cotton was available, leading to reduced product quality and relatively higher costs. Furthermore, the lack of organization in product sales also hindered the development of cotton weaving factory production. To overcome these shortcomings and unify their approach in the struggle against speculative private merchants, the Jinhua Textile Factory and the Trading Company, under the direct leadership of the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, the North China General Trading Company, and the Taiyuan Industry and Commerce Bureau, have agreed to the following supply and sales contract this month, based on the decision of the North China Financial and Economic Committee regarding the strict division of labor between production and sales: (1) The Trading Company shall guarantee a sufficient supply of raw cotton to the Jinhua Textile Factory based on its production plan to ensure reasonable operation and consolidate product quantity and quality. The Jinhua Factory shall not purchase raw cotton on its own. If the supply of raw cotton is insufficient or does not meet the standards agreed upon by both parties, resulting in losses to the Jinhua Factory's production, the Trading Company shall be responsible for economic compensation. (2) For the purpose of unified purchase and sales, all products of the Jinhua Factory shall be handed over to the Trading Company for unified sales and shall not be sold without authorization. The Jinhua Factory shall notify the Trading Company in advance each month of the quantity of production, according to the production plan, in order to plan for distribution and sales. The pricing of finished products shall be based on the actual value in kind, with each bundle (ten pounds) of 16-count yarn priced at eleven pounds seven of raw cotton, manufacturing costs equivalent to 60 jin of millet, and industrial profits of 23 jin. The Trading Company shall not accumulate, refuse to sell, or delay payment for the Jinhua Factory's products without valid reasons. If major difficulties arise in the future, they shall be resolved through negotiation between the two parties. During the term of the contract, both parties must maintain good faith and fulfill their obligations according to the agreement, without increasing or decreasing prices. (3) The Jinhua Factory shall deliver goods according to the production plan, and the product manufacturing shall not be arbitrarily changed in type, nor shall the output be reduced or the quality lowered without reason, affecting the allocation of yarn. If the products do not meet the standards stipulated by both parties, they may be rejected, or if the quality of the products is low, resulting in losses to the Trading Company in distribution, the Jinhua Factory shall also be liable for economic compensation. (4) The quantity of raw materials supplied by the Trading Company shall be temporarily based on the standard of 400,000 pounds of raw cotton for every 10,000 spindles. If the number of spindles is increased in the future, the amount shall be supplemented according to this ratio. (5) Industry and commerce taxes shall be temporarily borne by the Trading Company, and it is stipulated that both parties shall exchange information at any time, conduct regular inspections of work, and improve management methods to strengthen the state-owned economy and develop production. The term of this contract is six months, effective from February.

　　晋华纱厂与晋中贸易公司
  　议定统一购销合同
    产销双方严格分工密切合作
    【晋中电】榆次晋华纺织厂与晋中贸易公司成立统一购销协定。该两国营企业部门，因购买原料棉花，于去冬在平遥、汾阳、交城一带，曾发生争购现象，因此，所收购的棉花质量较差，只好有什么花就纺什么花，致使产品质量降低，而成本相对提高。且在推销产品上，因无组织状态的存在，也影响扶植棉织厂生产。为克服上述缺点，统一步调，向投机私商进行斗争。晋华纺织厂与贸易公司在华北人民政府企业部与华北总贸易公司以及太原工商局直接领导下，根据华北财政经济委员会关于产销严格分工的决定，于本月上旬双方协议订定供销合同如下：（一）贸易公司依据晋华纺织厂的生产计划，为使其合理经营，巩固其产品数量与质量，要保证对该厂原棉之充分供给；晋华厂不得自行采购原棉，倘因原棉供给不足或不符双方协定之标准，而使晋华厂生产受损失时，贸易公司应负经济赔偿之责。（二）为了统筹统销，晋华厂之生产品全数交由贸易公司统销，不得擅自出售；晋华厂每月须将生产之数量，预先依照生产计划填列概率表通知贸易公司，以便筹划分配推销。成品定价双方规定，一概以实物折价为标准，每捆（十磅）十六支纱，定为原棉十一磅七，其制造费合小米六十斤，工业利润廿三斤；晋华厂产品，贸易公司不得借故积存、推诿不销或延迟付款。今后如遇较大困难时，由双方议定解决。在合同有效期间，双方必须保持信用，按约履行经营，不得增减价格。（三）晋华厂应按照生产计划交货，产品制造不得随意变更种类，更不得无故减少产量与降低质量，影响纱料分配。如产品不符双方规定之标准时可拒收，或因产品质量低，致使贸易公司在分配中受到损失时，晋华厂同样有经济赔偿之责。（四）贸易公司所供原料数量，暂以纱锭万枚需原棉四十万磅为标准，今后如增纱锭，得以此比例增补。（五）工商纳税暂由贸易公司负担，并规定双方随时交换情况，定期检查工作，改进经营方法，以壮大国营经济，发展生产。该项合同规定从二月起以六个月为有效期。
