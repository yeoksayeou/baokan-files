　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Moscow News: The Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union closed on the 14th. At the final session, both the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities unanimously approved the Soviet Union's national budget for 1949 and the decrees promulgated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union between the Fourth and Fifth Sessions of the Supreme Soviet. They also decided on some personnel appointments and removals.

　　After the debates on the budget concluded in both houses, Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev delivered identical concluding speeches in both houses, stating that the draft budget for 1949 and the report on the execution of the budget for 1947 had been fully endorsed by the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The discussions on the budget confirmed that this budget was in line with the tasks facing the Soviet Union in the fourth year of the post-war five-year plan. Zverev announced that the Council of Ministers had reviewed the proposal by the budget committees of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to increase national budget revenue by 835 million rubles and had approved it. Zverev also stated that the Council of Ministers would review the deputies' proposals to increase the budgets of the Soviet Union's member republics and states based on their respective situations (note: the government's budget stipulated that the budgets of the republics would increase by 7 billion rubles compared to 1948, and the deputies requested further increases). Zverev said that the successful execution of the 1949 budget would be of great significance for the completion and exceeding of the post-war five-year plan and for the Soviet Union's steady advance towards communism. After Zverev's speech, both houses unanimously approved the budget and the budget law.

　　Both houses reviewed the decrees promulgated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union between the Fourth and Fifth Sessions of the Supreme Soviet and unanimously approved them.

　　Both houses elected Vasily Kozlov and Vasily Gogova as Deputy Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and removed Natalevici and Struya from their posts as Deputy Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. They also elected Vasily Kudriyanov as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and removed Popkov from his post as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议已于十四日闭幕，联邦院与民族院在末次会上均一致批准了苏联一九四九年的国家预算及最高苏维埃主席团在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议到第五次会议期间所颁布的法令，并决定了部份的人事任免。
    在两院对预算的辩论结束之后，苏联财政部长兹维列夫曾先后在两院发表相同的总结演讲说：一九四九年预算草案与一九四七年预算执行情形的报告，已获得苏联最高苏维埃代表们的完全赞同，对预算的讨论，证实了这一预算是符合于苏联在战后五年计划第四年度中所面临的任务的。兹维列夫宣称：部长会议审议了苏联最高苏维埃两院预算委员会所提增加国家预算岁入八亿三千五百万的建议，并已予同意。兹维列夫又称：代表们所提增加苏联加盟共和国及州的预算，部长会议将按照其各自情况予以审议（按：政府所订的预算中，规定各共和国的预算比一九四八年增加七十亿卢布，代表们要求再予增加）。兹维列夫说：一九四九年预算的胜利执行，对战后五年计划的完成与超过，对苏联向共产主义的稳步迈进，将具有巨大意义。兹维列夫讲演后，两院均先后一致批准了预算及预算法。
    两院审议了苏联最高苏维埃主席团在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议到第五次会议期间所颁布的法令，并予以一致批准。
