Criticisms and Suggestions

    Reporting on Supporting the Army Should Become a Regular Task
    To the Editors:
    Recently, your newspaper has devoted a large amount of space to publishing letters of support for the army and reporting on the situation of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families in various places. The comrades in the army are very gratified. We have also seen that the North China People's Government has called on all localities to carry out work to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families during the Spring Festival, which is also a great encouragement to the army. I feel that such reporting should become a regular part of your newspaper's content. I also suggest that governments at all levels (especially counties, districts, and villages) should regularly and periodically, in addition to general reporting on the work of giving preferential treatment to military families, more importantly, inform the troops stationed in each county about the specific and practical situation of solving the difficulties of military families, using the form of letters of condolence. After receiving such letters, the troops should try to convey them to the soldiers, because this is a matter of constant concern to the troops. In addition, the troops should also notify the military families and the government to which they belong of the heroic deeds of combat heroes and meritorious personnel in the form of "Meritorious Service News," which will also be a great comfort to the military families. I hope that the troops and the government will work together to carry out this work!

    In addition, please advise the North China People's Government to compile and publish the various policies and decrees uniformly formulated after the merger of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji border regions, so that the masses, especially the troops, can study and follow them!

　　Zhao Ming's Maltreatment of Nanny Should Be Reviewed
    To the Editors:
    When I was staying in Yangquan Hospital, I saw such a thing, that is, Zhao Ming (female, cadre of Yangquan City Federation of Trade Unions), who was hospitalized, abused her nanny. The nanny was a seventeen-year-old girl (formerly a child bride). She originally took care of Zhao's eldest son, and Zhao called her specifically because she was afraid that the hospital would not take good care of him while she was hospitalized. Zhao was very mean to the nanny in the hospital... Zhao's husband was also the same... The comrades who were watching could not stand it anymore, so many nurses and patients suggested that I write this matter to the party newspaper. Zhao has successively served as director of the district women's federation and member of the county women's federation. Her husband, Liu Zhuxi, once served as county magistrate; the nanny is from Pindin and is named Yumei. Her husband is a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, I suggest that Zhao and her husband should make a profound review, and their leading organs should give strict criticism.

    批评与建议
　　拥军报导　应成为经常工作编辑同志：
    最近贵报拿出很大篇幅登载劳军书信，并报导了各地劳军优军情形，部队同志十分欣慰，又看到华北人民政府号召各地进行春节优军拥军工作，对部队也是一个很大的鼓励，我感到这样的报导应成为贵报的经常内容之一，并建议各级政府（尤其县区村）应经常定期的将优军工作除作一般报导外，更重要的是将解决军属困难的具体实际情况，采用慰问信的方式告诉各县所在部队，部队接收这种信件后则应设法传达给战士，因为这是部队经常关心的问题。另外部队亦应将战斗英雄和功臣们的英勇事迹采取“立功喜报”的方式通知其军属及所属政府，这对军属也将是很大的安慰，望部队和政府共同进行这一工作！
    另外请贵报建议华北人民政府，应将晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀边区合并后统一制定之各种政策法令，合编合辑，公开出版，以便群众特别是部队学习遵循！

　　赵明虐待褓姆  应作检讨编辑同志：
    我在住阳泉医院的时候，看到这样一个事情，即住院的赵明（女，阳泉市总工会干事）虐待褓姆，褓姆是个十七岁的小女孩（从前是给别人当童养媳），原先给赵看大儿子，赵住院怕医院里看护不周，特意叫来的。赵在院时对褓姆很刻薄………赵的爱人也同样………旁观的同志都看不下去，所以，很多护士和住院者都提议要我把这个事情写给党报。赵历任区妇会主任、县妇联委员，他爱人刘竹西，曾任县长等职；褓姆是平定人，名玉梅，男人是人民解放军战士。因此，我建议赵夫妇应作深刻检讨，其领导机关应给予严格批评。
