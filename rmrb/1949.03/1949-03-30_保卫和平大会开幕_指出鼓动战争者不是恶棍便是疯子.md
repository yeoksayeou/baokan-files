　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 28th: TASS reports: The World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace opened in New York on the night of March 25th. 1,800 people attended a banquet to welcome foreign delegations, offering prolonged applause to the members of the Soviet delegation. Chairman Shapley, an astronomer, stated in his opening address that the main issue of the conference was the defense of peace. Shapley criticized the U.S. State Department for preventing representatives from certain countries from attending the conference. Soviet representative and musician Shostakovich greeted the conference, saying: Let me, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, extend heartfelt congratulations to the representatives of the American cultural circles. We will unite with you to accomplish the lofty task of defending peace and opposing the enemies of peace. We are delighted to meet with the most outstanding representatives of American intellectuals. I am confident that this conference will be useful and beneficial for our common cause. It will be appropriate to strengthen the strong ties between the cultural representatives of our two great nations in the future. This friendship and the resulting mutual understanding will be beneficial to establishing world peace, which all nations and peoples eagerly desire. Let our joint efforts not be in vain, and let our hopes become reality!
　　Following this, Polish representative Professor Ossowski gave a brief congratulatory speech to the conference. Cuban representative, Ms. Aguil, Vice-President of the Cuban Democratic Women's League, protested against the actions of the U.S. authorities, because the U.S. authorities reduced the delegation representing the scientific and cultural circles of Latin America to only four Cubans and one Puerto Rican. Puerto Rican poet Cabrilla emphasized in his speech that the entire Latin America is generally concerned about the peace conference.
　　The only British representative, Stapleton, pointed out first that he was also the only representative from Western Europe due to the U.S. State Department's exclusion of representatives from various countries. He criticized Churchill's war propaganda, saying that Churchill did not know and could not express the true thoughts and hopes of the British people. When the audience heard Churchill's name, they booed loudly. Stapleton insisted: The British people unanimously and strongly oppose war, and despite the anti-Soviet propaganda, they still maintain friendly feelings towards the Soviet people.
　　American playwright Hellman rose to expose the reactionaries who attempted to undermine the conference and split the ranks of American progressive intellectuals. Hellman also criticized the role played by the State Department in this regard. Hellman said: Those who incite new wars are "either villains or madmen."
　　The peace conference received many congratulatory telegrams from scientists and cultural workers around the world. French representative Catholic priest Boller, who was unable to attend because he was refused an entry visa by the U.S. authorities, said in a letter to the conference: The ugly idea of the atomic bomb crusade must be completely defeated. British physicist Blackett criticized the North Atlantic Treaty as a war measure in his letter.

　　保卫和平大会开幕
    指出鼓动战争者不是恶棍便是疯子
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社讯：在纽约召开的世界文化科学界保卫和平大会于三月二十五日夜开幕，一千八百人出席招待外国代表团的欢宴，他们对苏联代表团团员致历久不息的欢呼。主席天文学家沙普莱在会议开幕时致词称，会议的主要问题是保卫和平问题。沙普莱抨击美国国务院阴止某些国家的代表出席会议。苏联代表音乐家萧斯塔科维奇向大会致意说：让我代表苏联代表团向美国文化界的代表们致衷心的祝贺。我们要与你们团结一致完成保卫和平、反对和平之敌的崇高任务。我们和美国知识分子最优秀的代表会晤感到欢欣。我确信这个会议对于我们的共同事业，将是有用而且是有益的。这对于加强我们两大民族文化代表间未来的坚强联系将是合适的，这一友谊及因此而产生的相互谅解，对于建立一切国家的普遍人民所急切期望的世界和平，将有所裨益。让我们的共同努力不至白费，让我们的希望成为真实吧！
    继之，波兰代表奥索夫斯基教授对会议作简短贺词。古巴代表，古巴民主妇女联盟副主席阿吉尔对美国当局的行动表示抗议，因为美国当局把代表拉丁美洲科学文化界的代表团减少到只有四个古巴人和一个波多黎各人。波多黎各诗人卡布里拉在演说中强调指出，整个拉丁美洲普遍关心和平会议。
    唯一的英国代表斯达普顿演说，首先指出由于美国国务院的排斥各国代表，所以他也是西欧的唯一代表。他抨击邱吉尔的战争宣传说，邱吉尔不知道而且也不能表达英国人民的真正思想和希望。听众当听到邱吉尔的名字时，发出高声的嘲骂，斯达普顿力称：英国人民一致强烈反对战争，尽管有敌视苏联的宣传，他们对苏联人民仍保持友好的感情。
    美国剧作家海尔曼起来揭发试图破坏会议和分裂美国进步知识分子之行列的反动派。海尔曼又抨击国务院在这方面所起的作用。海尔曼说：鼓动新战争的人“不是恶棍便是疯子”。
    和平会议接到世界各地科学家和文化工作者的许多贺电。被美国当局拒绝发给入境护照而未能出席的法国代表天主教神甫鲍勒，在致大会的信中说：必须澈底击败原子弹十字军这一丑恶的念头。英国物理学家布莱凯特在信中抨击北大西洋公约为战争措施。
