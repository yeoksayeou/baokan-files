　　Shijiazhuang News: To meet the industrial requirements of the urban area and simultaneously increase grain production, so that agriculture and industry are closely coordinated, the Municipal Construction Bureau, in conjunction with the governments of the four suburban districts, has formulated an agricultural production plan. Based on the soil quality of the suburban districts and the experience of farmers, it has been decided to massively plant cotton and special crops such as sugar beets. The total land area of the suburban districts is 140,000 mu, and it is estimated that 35,000 mu to 49,000 mu will be planted with cotton, accounting for 25% to 30% of the total cultivated land area in the city (before this, the cotton planting area was less than 10%). Assuming an average yield of 150 jin to 200 jin of seed cotton per mu, this can be converted into 50 jin to 70 jin of ginned cotton. If each jin of ginned cotton is exchanged for 8 jin of millet, the yield per mu can be equivalent to 400 jin to 560 jin of millet. To ensure the completion of this plan, the Shijiazhuang Cooperative Headquarters has allocated 33 million yuan (People's Currency) in cotton loans, and prepared 140,000 jin of cotton seeds. Supply and marketing cooperatives in each district will widely develop members, issue loans, and solve problems such as seeds, fertilizers, and tools. During the cotton harvest, the supply and marketing cooperatives will purchase cotton from members at prices higher than the market price, or exchange it for grain, to ensure that members do not suffer losses. The North China Farm also has insecticides in reserve to prevent insect pests.
    To supply the needs of the sugar factory to be established in the city, 2,000 mu of sugar beets will be trial-planted in the sixth and seventh districts. All students of the North China Agricultural College will be dispersed to various villages to provide practical guidance, ensuring that each mu generates income equivalent to 400 jin of millet. The college will be responsible for signing contracts with the growers.
    The entire suburban area of the city has also decided to make use of roadsides, corners of fields, newly filled ditches, slopes, and open spaces to universally plant castor beans, calling on the people of the city's suburban areas to plant an average of one tree per person, with an estimated planting of 100,000 trees.
    Of the 140,000 mu of cultivated land in the city, excluding the 40,000+ mu for cotton and sugar beets, the remaining 100,000 mu will be planted with grain. Assuming an increase of 10 jin per mu, a total of 1 million jin can be increased. Together with the increased cotton production, the total increase can reach 4 million jin.
    The Municipal Construction Bureau calls on all districts to organize manpower, animal power, and tools in a planned manner, and apply large amounts of fertilizer to ensure the completion of the plan. According to statistics from the land reform last year, the four districts have a total of 2,938 cattle, donkeys, and mules. This year, 1,500 heads are to be added. In terms of manure accumulation, this spring's cultivation requires 5,500 jin of stable manure to be applied per mu, and an average of 4,000 jin of fertilizer to be applied per mu for summer planting. In order to prevent drought, it is also proposed to universally repair wells, increase waterwheels, and transform 1,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. This plan is now being gradually deployed and implemented.

　　石市四郊计划植棉
  　密切配合市区工业建设
    【石家庄讯】为适应市区工业要求，并同时增产粮食，使农业与工业取得密切配合，市建设局特会同四个郊区的政府订出农业生产计划。并根据市郊区土质与农民的经验，决定大量种植棉花及甜萝卜等特种作物。全市郊区土地十四万亩，预计植棉三万五千亩到四万九千亩，占全市耕地面积百分之廿五到卅（在此以前植棉面积不足百分之十），以普通产量每亩一百五十斤到二百斤籽棉计算，可折合皮棉五十斤到七十斤，以每斤皮棉换小米八斤计算，每亩产量则可抵小米四百斤到五百六十斤。为保证这一计划的完成，石市合作总社特以三千三百万元（人民币）发放棉业货款，并准备棉种十四万斤，由各区供销合作社广泛发展社员，发放贷款，解决其种籽、肥料、工具等问题。在棉花收获时，供销合作社将高于市价收购社员的棉花，或以粮食交换，保证不让社员吃亏。华北农场尚备有杀虫用品以防虫灾。
    为供应本市即将设立糖厂的需要，于六、七两区试种甜萝卜两千亩。由华北农学院全体学员分散到各村，实际指导。保证每亩收入抵四百斤小米，由该院负责与种户订立合同。
    全市郊区并决定利用路边、地角、新填的沟濠、土坡、空地，普遍点种大麻子，号召市郊区人民平均每人植一棵，预计可植十万棵。
    全市耕地十四万亩，除去棉花与甜萝卜的四万多亩外，其余十万亩种植粮食，每亩增产以十斤计，共可增产一百万斤，连同棉花增产总量可达四百万斤。
    市建设局号召各区将人力、畜力、工具有计划地组织起来，大量施肥，以保证计划的完成。去年土地改革中统计，四个区共有牛、驴、骡二千九百卅八头，今年要增加一千五百头。积肥方面，今年春耕要求每亩施圈肥五千五百斤，夏种施肥平均每亩四千斤。为了防旱，并提出普遍修井。增加水车，改造一千亩旱地为水田。现此项计划正逐步布置推行中。
