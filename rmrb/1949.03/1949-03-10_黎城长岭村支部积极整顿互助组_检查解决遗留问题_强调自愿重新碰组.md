(Taihang Telegram) The Changling Village Branch in the Second District of Licheng is actively rectifying mutual aid, initially establishing the organizational foundation for this year's major production campaign. The first step in the village's approach is to convene a meeting of all Party members and enthusiastic male and female activists among the masses, mobilizing for spring plowing preparations and unanimously proposing the necessity of rectifying mutual aid. It was decided that Party members and activists would serve as the backbone, dividing responsibilities and gradually carrying out rectification: First, assigning manpower in a planned manner, using lanes as units, progressing from point to area, conducting individual visits to understand the situation and identify problems. Out of 576 households in the village, 501 participated in mutual aid, forming 33 groups. Among them, seven were formal groups formed involuntarily. Six groups were organized through a single meeting to cope with higher authorities. Because the village did not effectively mobilize the masses during the rectification of mutual aid last year, and cadres were unclear about the purpose of organizing, some mutual aid teams drifted without leadership. Second, cadres, Party members, and activists convened group meetings in lanes, combining the masses' own practical experiences of mutual aid to discuss the benefits of organizing. Through discussion, four major benefits of mutual aid groups were clarified: First, mutual aid provides greater strength, saving labor and accomplishing more work; second, difficulties can be overcome, ensuring both support duties and farming; third, mutual assistance and mutual learning can improve skills; fourth, organizing avoids the old path of each looking after their own interests and can enable emancipated peasants to become prosperous. After affirming the achievements of mutual aid, the shortcomings of involuntary mutual aid, undemocratic leadership, and unequal labor exchange were also criticized. The methods for organizing mutual aid in the future were discussed. Cadres and Party members also reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of past leadership in mutual aid, clarifying that they must fully promote democracy, follow the mass line, and lead the masses to organize under the Party's policies and principles in the future. Third, after ideological mobilization of Party members and non-Party members regarding organization, the masses were guided to boldly express their true thoughts. Under the principle of distinguishing right from wrong, affirming achievements, and criticizing shortcomings, outstanding issues such as uncleared wages, unequal labor exchange, and undemocratic cadre leadership were specifically resolved. In examining past mutual aid and resolving outstanding issues, particular emphasis was placed on implementing education on mutual aid policies, inspiring the masses' ideological awareness of organization. On the basis of mutual aid, mutual benefit, voluntary participation, and democracy, the masses were called upon to organize, allowing them to freely form groups. Through one and a half days of deliberation, connection, and free association, with the leading and backbone role of Party members and activists, 34 groups were organized in the village, involving 458 households. Women also organized 32 textile mutual aid groups. (Editor's note: It is reported that mutual aid has a foundation in this area, but the problems are still significant. Therefore, this time, with emphasis on activists taking the lead, 458 households were organized to form mutual aid teams in just one and a half days. It is hoped that a thorough inspection will be conducted to avoid repeating the mistakes of formalism and involuntary coercion.) Currently, the village's mutual aid teams, after preliminary rectification, have formulated a 25-day production plan and are now actively delivering manure and gathering firewood in preparation for spring plowing, in conjunction with Party rectification.

    检查解决遗留问题
  　强调自愿重新碰组
    【太行电】黎城二区长岭村支部积极整顿互助，初步建立了今年大生产运动的组织基础。该村在作法上的第一步是：召开全体党员及群众中的男女积极分子会议，动员春耕生产准备，一致提出整顿互助的必要。决定以党员及积极分子为骨干，分工负责，逐步整顿：一、有计划的分配力量，以巷为单位，由点到面，进行个别访问，了解情况，发现问题。全村五百七十六户，参加互助的五百零一户，共卅三个小组。其中有七个是不自愿的形式组。有六个组是为了应付上级，经过一个会议而组织起来的。由于去年该村在整顿互助时，没有很好的发动群众，干部对组织起来的目的不明确，致使一部分互助组在无领导的情况下自流了。二、干部党员积极分子分巷召开小组会，结合群众亲身互助的实际体验，拉扯组织起来的好处。经过讨论，明确了互助组四大好处：第一、互助力量大，省工多做活；第二、困难能克服，支差种田两不误；第三、互相帮助，互相学习，能提高技术；第四、组织起来不怕走过去各顾各的老路，可以使翻身农民发家致富。经过肯定互助成绩，也批判了互助不自愿，领导不民主，变工不等价等缺点，讨论了今后组织互助的办法。干部党员也检查了过去领导互助的优缺点，明确了今后必须充分发扬民主，走群众路线，在党的政策原则下，领导群众组织起来。三、党内外经过组织起来的思想发动后，引导群众大胆说心思话，在分清是非，肯定成绩，批判缺点的原则下，具体的解决工资未清算，变工不等价，干部领导不民主等遗留问题。在检查以往互助和解决遗留问题中，特别强调贯彻了互助政策的教育，启发群众组织起来的思想自觉。在互助互利自愿民主的基础上号召群众组织起来，放手让群众自由结组，经过一天半的酝酿串通与自由结合，以党员积极分子的带头与骨干作用，全村组织起来三十四个小组，参加户数四百五十八户。妇女也组织起三十二个纺织互助组。（编者按：据悉：该地互助是有基础的，但毛病还不小，因之，这次在强调积极分子带头的情况下，一天半时间即组织了四百五十八户成立互助，希深入检查一下，勿再重复产生了形式主义和强制不自愿的毛病。）目前该村互助组经过初步整顿，订出了二十五天的生产计划，现正结合整党积极送粪打柴，准备春耕。
