Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS reported: In commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, the New Era magazine published an editorial entitled "The Defender of Peace," stating:

　　The developments of the past few weeks have made the policies adopted by the US and British ruling groups to carry out aggression and brew new wars even more obvious. From Truman's refusal to conduct peaceful negotiations with the Soviet Union, followed by the US-British group's rejection in the Security Council of the new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on February 8 for disarmament, prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of atomic energy control, the true nature of this policy has become very clear. "Peace is hateful!"—this sentence from an American journalist aptly describes the psychology of American monopoly capitalists, who have already earned a lot from the military in the United States and Western Europe. They are calculating that if they plunge the world into a new massacre, they will earn even more.

　　However, the vast majority of mankind is truly and urgently concerned about lasting and consolidated democratic peace. The Soviet Union leads the anti-imperialist camp and the forces fighting for lasting democratic peace and security in the world. When fighting for peace, the Soviet Union has to take into account the fact that the US and British policies of facilitating new wars are primarily aimed at the Soviet people who are successfully building a communist society.

　　The Soviet armed forces are a reliable pillar of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and a loyal defender of the peaceful labor of the people of the great socialist country. The Soviet armed forces are a new type of army. For the first time in history, there has emerged an army whose soldiers are in harmony with the people, with the people's labor, the people's interests and aspirations, and who are fully aware of what they are defending. Marxist-Leninist science proved long ago that the armies of imperialist countries are tools of the oppressor states and weapons of capitalism against labor. They are hired to use iron and blood to destroy the people's democratic liberation movements in Greece, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Hungary, Malaya, the Philippines, and many other countries. They not only fight in the colonies but also in their own suzerain states. Did not the French army send tanks to suppress striking French miners? Such an army, which is a tool for plundering colonies and oppressing the people, cannot have high morale. They rely solely on the power of their machines for eliminating humanity. But machines have no life without people. This is especially true in war. This is one of the weaknesses of the planners of a new world war and new aggression. The 31-year history of the Soviet armed forces shows how immeasurably great their spirit and spiritual potential are, and how enormous and decisive this fact has been and still is. The purpose of the Soviet army is noble because the Soviet state has never launched, and cannot and will not launch, an unjust, aggressive war. The progressive thought of the Soviet army, filled with the lofty ideals of international friendship, is one of the foundations of its strength.

　　The Soviet army is the first army in history that not only has the most advanced military art but also the most progressive military science. Military science, as a branch of Marxist-Leninist social science, was created by the people's leader, the organizer and commander of the Soviet armed forces, Marshal Stalin. The most vivid proof of the Soviet army's ability to successfully apply Stalin's victorious science is its defeat of the Hitler gang, which had previously terrified the armies of all countries.

　　The Second World War was the most rigorous test for the Soviet armed forces and the entire Soviet people. But we gloriously withstood this test. The Soviet army and the people were integrated into one, fully supported by our socialist country, and equipped with the latest and best equipment produced by our factories. They brilliantly completed their mission. They not only preserved their own country but also liberated the European countries from the shackles of fascism, crushed the Hitler army and the Hitler state, and saved Europe and the whole world from fascist enslavement.

　　It is perfectly natural that the people of the world regard the Soviet army as their loyal friend and defender of international peace and security. The existence of this force is a serious obstacle to the new US and British ambitionists who vainly attempt to dominate the world. At present, the warmongers place their hopes on the American atomic bomb, which they see as a tool for easily winning blitzkriegs. But everyone should remember the lessons of the Nazi thugs, who, with the help of their air force and armored units, attacked the Soviet Union, thinking they would achieve a lightning victory. Hitler's plan ended in complete failure. Isn't it obvious that the hopes of the US and British ambitionists who vainly attempt to dominate the world are just as absurd as the plans of their German ancestors? The Soviet armed forces, armed and nurtured by the Lenin-Stalin Party, have been, are, and will always be the loyal defenders of the Soviet Union's peaceful labor, leading the forces of world democracy, peace, and security.

### 新时代杂志社论  和平的保卫者　纪念苏联建军三十一周年

    和平的保卫者
  　纪念苏联建军三十一周年
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社讯：苏联建军三十一周年纪念日，新时代杂志发表题为“和平的保卫者”的社论称：
    过去数星期局势的发展，使美英统治集团所采取的进行侵略与酝酿新战争的政策更加明显了。从杜鲁门拒绝与苏联和平谈判，及继之而来的美英集团在安理会中拒绝苏联在二月八日所提出的裁军、禁用原子武器及建立原子能管制的新建议看来，这一政策的真实性质已经很明显了。“和平是讨厌的！”——美国记者的这句话，恰恰地描写了美国垄断资本家的心理，他们从美国与西欧的军事中已经赚得很多。他们计算着：如果他们将世界投入新的大屠杀中，那么，他们会赚得更多。
    但是，人类的绝大多数是真正迫切地关心着持久与巩固的民主和平的。苏联领导着反帝国主义阵营，领导着为世界持久民主和平与安全而斗争的力量。当为和平而斗争时，苏联不得不考虑到这样的事实，即美英的促成新战争的政策，是首先针对着正在成功地建设着共产主义社会的苏联人民的。
    苏联的武装部队，是苏联和平外交政策的可靠支柱，是伟大社会主义国家人民和平劳动的忠实保卫者。苏联武装部队是新式的军队。在历史上第一次产生了这样的军队，它的士兵是同人民、同人民的劳动、人民的利益与愿望相一致的，他们充分觉悟到他们所保卫的是什么。马克思主义——列宁主义科学很早以前即已证明：帝国主义国家的军队，是压迫者国家的工具，是资本主义反对劳动的武器。他们是被雇佣来用铁血摧毁希腊、印尼、越南、缅匈、马来亚、菲律宾及许多其他国家的人民民主解放运动的。他们不仅在殖民地内作战，而且也在他们自己的宗主国内作战。法国的军队不是曾派坦克去镇压罢工的法国矿工吗？这种作为掠夺殖民地及压迫人民的工具的军队，是不能够有高昂的士气的。他们仅仅依靠其消灭人类的机器的力量。但是，机器没有了人就没有了生命。在战争中尤其如此。这就是新世界战争新侵略计划者的弱点之一。苏联武装部队三十一年的历史，表明他们的精神及精神潜力是多么无可衡量地伟大，表明这一事实曾经有过现在还仍然有着多么巨大与决定性的意义。苏联军队的目的是崇高的，因为苏联国家从没有发动过，而且不能也将不会发动非正义的、侵略的战争。满怀国际友好的崇高理想的苏联军队的进步思想，是它的力量的基础之一。
    苏联军队是历史上第一个不仅有着最先进的军事艺术，而且有着最进步的军事科学的军队。作为马列主义社会科学的一个部门的军事科学，是由人民的领袖、苏联武装部队的组织者与指挥者斯大林大元帅所创造的。苏联军队成功地运用斯大林这一胜利科学的才能，其最生动的证明就是它击败了希特勒匪帮，在那以前，这一匪帮曾经使世界各国的军队感到恐怖。
    第二次世界大战，是苏联武装部队与全体苏联人民的最严格的考验。但是，我们光荣地经受了这一考验。苏联军队与人民结成一体，得到我们社会主义国家全力的支持，有着我们工厂所生产的最新式的优良装备，他们灿烂地完成了他们的使命。他们不仅保全了自己的国家，而且从法西斯的桎梏下解救了欧洲国家，粉碎了希特勒军队及希特勒国家，使欧洲及全世界得免于法西斯的奴役。
    全世界的人民把苏联军队看作他们的忠实朋友与国际和平安全的保卫者，这是十分自然的事。这一力量的存在，对于新的妄图独霸世界的美英野心家是严重的障碍。目前，战争贩子把他们的希望寄托在美国的原子弹上面，他们目之为闪击战中轻易取胜的工具，但是，每个人都该记得纳粹暴徒的教训，他们曾凭借着他们的空军及装甲部队的帮助进攻苏联，以为会得到闪击的胜利。希特勒的打算以全部惨败而告终。妄图独霸世界的美英野心家的希望，恰恰就象他们德国祖先的打算一样荒谬，难道还不明显吗？为列宁斯大林党所武装与培育的苏联武装部队，过去是、现在是、而且将来也是领导着世界民主、和平与安全的力量的苏联和平劳动的忠实保卫者。
