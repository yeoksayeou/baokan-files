　　Written Before the Performance of "The White Haired Girl"
　　桑夫

　　We, the First Performing Arts Troupe of North China University, are pleased to stage "The White Haired Girl" in the liberated ancient cultural city of Beiping today, because the broad masses of Beiping are now bitterly cursing the feudal rule of the old society and joyfully singing praises for the light of the new society.

　　The Communist Party's literary and artistic teams have persisted in the struggle in the vast countryside of China for ten, twenty years. Today, we are back in the city again, and we are willing to tell our worker brothers, students, and the broad masses of citizens about how we worked in the countryside. "The White Haired Girl" can be regarded as a report of our work to everyone!

　　"The White Haired Girl" is performed in the form of opera. It will tell the audience how cruelly landlords and despots oppressed and exploited tens of thousands of peasants, and how the masses carried out arduous struggles. It shows the contrast between two different worlds and also shows the people's liberation.

　　The entire creation of "The White Haired Girl" is a collective creation, which Comrade He Jingzhi affirmed in the preface to the script of "The White Haired Girl" published in Zhangjiakou in 1946. Its collective nature is not only limited to playwrights, directors, actors, and stage staff, but more broadly, it constantly absorbed the opinions of the broad masses during the creation and performance process, and made constant revisions based on these opinions, so that the script and performance became more complete. This time, our performance is also based on this foundation, and we have made some revisions to the past performances.

　　The original play was completed in Yan'an in April 1945, and it has been five years now. In the past five years, it has been staged in Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Harbin, North China, Central China, and the vast areas of Northeast China. And these performance processes are also the process of creation and modification.

　　The writers, Comrades He Jingzhi and Ding Yi, used to work in the Yan'an Lu Xun Arts College. During the creation process, comrades from the Northwest Battlefield Service Corps who had persisted in literary and artistic struggles behind enemy lines and district cadres who had worked in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region participated in the discussion at that time. The initial draft of this work was completed in collective discussions.

　　The original directors were Comrades Wang Dahua and Shu Qiang, but Comrade Dahua unfortunately passed away in Northeast China in 1946. When we perform this play, we express our great grief to our dead comrade-in-arms, because Comrade Dahua left us a very valuable legacy in the creation of new opera. This performance was reorganized and re-directed by Comrade Shu Qiang. Although most of the actors have been replaced by new people, we are willing to make great efforts and a serious attitude to create, so that it can reach the proper level. The original stage design was designed by Comrade Xu Ke, supplemented by Comrade Zhong Jingzhi in Zhangjiakou, and this time it was supplemented and designed by Comrade Zhang Yao, and there were some modifications. We also strive to explore something in the stage design part of the new opera.

　　In short, the creation and performance of this play is constantly enriched and constantly enriched in the broad opinions of the masses. This large collective creation is to make the work itself more complete and truly able to express the life of the masses.

　　Before the premiere, only a brief introduction of "The White Haired Girl" can be given like this. We hope that the broad audience will give us more opinions after watching the play, and we also hope that the seniors in the theater industry, the gentlemen and comrades in the literary and art circles, will give us more criticism and corrections.

　　写在“白毛女”上演之前
    桑夫
    我们华北大学第一文工团，今天在解放后的文化古城北平上演“白毛女”，我们感到愉快，因为北平目前广大的群众正痛恶地诅咒旧社会的封建统治，欢欣地在为新社会的光明唱着赞歌。
    共产党的文艺队伍，在中国广大的乡村里坚持斗争，十年，二十年。今天，我们又回到城市里来了，我们愿意把我们在乡村里怎样工作的情形，告诉给我们的工人兄弟、学生及广大的市民，“白毛女”就算是向大家报告的一点工作吧！
    “白毛女”是以歌剧形式演出的，他会告诉观众：地主恶霸是如何残酷的在欺压剥削成千成万的农民，群众又是怎样进行艰苦的斗争。他表现了两个不同世界的对照，也表现了人民的翻身。
    “白毛女”的整个创作，是个集体创作，这是贺敬之同志在一九四六年张家口出版的白毛女剧本前言里所肯定的。他的集体性，不仅限于剧作者、导演、演员、舞台工作人员，而更广泛的是在创作和演出过程中不断的吸收了广大群众的意见，以及根据这些意见作了不断的修改，而使剧本与演出更趋于完整。这次我们的演出，也是基于这样的基础上，把过去的演出又作了部份的修改。
    此剧原作于一九四五年四月在延安完成，到现在已是五个年头了。五年中，在延安、张家口、哈尔滨、华北、华中及东北广大地区都曾上演过。而这些演出的过程，也正是创作修改的过程。
    执笔者，贺敬之同志、丁毅同志，过去在延安鲁艺工作团工作。在创作过程中当时参加讨论的，有曾在敌后坚持文艺斗争的西北战地服务团的同志们，和曾在晋察冀工作过的区干部。在集体讨论中完成了这部作品的初稿。
    原来的导演是由王大化同志、舒强同志担任的，但大化同志不幸在一九四六年逝世于东北，在我们演出这个戏的时候，以极大的悲痛向死去的战友致哀，因为大化同志在新歌剧的创作上，留给我们很宝贵的遗产。这次演出由舒强同志整理重新排演，演员虽已大部份由新人来代替了，但我们愿以极大的努力和严肃的态度进行创作，以使它能达到应有的水平。原舞台装置是由许可同志设计的，在张家口又由钟敬之同志补充，这次又经张尧同志补充设计，又有部份修改，我们也力图能在新歌剧的舞台装置部份，摸索一点东西出来。
    总之，这个剧本的创作与演出，是在广泛的群众意见中，不断地丰富、不断地充实的，这个大的集体创作，是为了使作品的本身更完整和真正能表现出群众的生活。
    公演之前，关于“白毛女”只能简单的介绍这样一点，希望广大的观众看过戏后，给我们多提些意见，同时也希望戏剧界的前辈、文艺界的诸位先生们、同志们，给我们更多的批评与指正。
