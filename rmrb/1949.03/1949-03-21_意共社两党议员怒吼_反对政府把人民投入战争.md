　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Electric News Agency, Rome, 17th: In the Italian parliament, every member of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party stood up in turn to deliver speeches before the vote, opposing the Christian Democratic government's attempt to throw the Italian people into American war preparations. After an all-night meeting, at eight o'clock this morning, approximately one hundred members were still waiting to speak. All of Italy is holding its breath today to pay attention to these members' speeches. When Gasperi stood up at 1:30 this morning to deliver a concluding statement on the North Atlantic Treaty, Communist Party and Socialist Party members shouted at him: "Down with war!" Left-wing members shouted Gasperi down, and the meeting was forced to adjourn. When the meeting resumed, Gasperi continued to speak, and there were very many interjections in the hall. Saragat, the leader of the right-wing Social Unity Party, once tried to stop the interjections, but was shouted down again by the cries of "Spy, spy—traitor, traitor!" which lasted for five minutes. The government majority made every effort last night to shorten the debate. The Communist Party proposed a motion advocating postponing the debate until the draft of the North Atlantic Treaty was published on the 18th, but this proposal was rejected. Italian Communist Party member and chairman of the Italian Women's League, Rossi, said: There is a new factor on the world stage today. Eighty-five million women have organized themselves all over the world, and they say: "No war!" Italian Communist Party member and chairman of the National Guerrilla Association, Boldrini, said: "The fighters of the Italian resistance movement will never take up arms against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries." Lombardi, editor of the Socialist Party's "Avanti!," said: "Once a war breaks out, we will do everything possible to make socialism born in the war. Italy will never fight in a hired war."
    Rome has called for a one-hour strike from five o'clock to six o'clock. The tram workers' strike will be limited to fifteen minutes.

　　意共社两党议员怒吼
    反对政府把人民投入战争
    【新华社陕北十九日电】电通社罗马十七日讯：意大利议会中每一个共产党和社会党的议员依次起立发表投票前的演说，反对基督教民主党政府想把意大利人民投入美国战争准备的企图。在澈夜会议后，今晨八时仍有议员约一百人等待着发言，全意大利今日屏息注意这些议员们的发言。当加斯贝利今晨一时三十分起立发表关于北大西洋公约的总结声明时，共产党和社会党议员对他高呼：“打倒战争！”左派议员把加斯贝利吼了下去，会议被迫休会。当会议重开时，加斯贝利继续发言，会场上插言就非常多，右派社会统一党领神萨拉盖特曾一度试图阻止插言，但为持续到五分钟的“间谍、间谍—卖国贼、卖国贼！”的呼声再度吼了下去。政府多数派昨夜以一切努力企图缩短辩论。共产党提出议案主张将辩论延期至十八日北大西洋公约草约公布时，但这个提案被否决。意共议员、意大利妇女联盟主席罗西说：世界舞台上今日存在着一个新的因素，八千五百万妇女已在全世界组织起来，她们说：“不要战争！”意共议员全国游击队协会主席波尔德里尼说：“意大利抵抗运动的战士决不拿起武器反对苏联和新民主国家。”社会党“前进报”编辑龙巴迪说：“一旦发生战争，我们将尽一切可能，使社会主义在战争中诞生。意大利决不在受雇的战争中作战。”
    罗马已号召从五点钟到六点钟罢工一小时。电车工人的罢工将限制为十五分钟。
