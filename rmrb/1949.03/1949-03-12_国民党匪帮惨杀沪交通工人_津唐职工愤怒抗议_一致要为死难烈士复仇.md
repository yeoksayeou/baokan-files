Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th—Tianjin workers from all sectors have expressed extreme shock and anger at the crimes of Kuomintang bandit leaders Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing, who brutally murdered Shanghai transportation workers Gu Bokang, Zhong Quanzhou, Wang Yuan, and others. The Tianjin office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee sent a letter to Shanghai workers at the beginning of the month, expressing condolences. The letter stated: "The time when our worker brothers and sisters can hold our heads high is not far off. We hope you will persevere in your struggle to the end. All of us Tianjin workers support you; you are not alone." Workers from Tianjin's railway, automobile, tram, postal, steel, textile, and other enterprises have also held meetings in recent days to mourn the three murdered workers and have issued telegrams protesting the bloody crimes of the Kuomintang bandit gang and expressing condolences to the Shanghai workers and the families of the martyred heroes. In the first few days of this month, the Tianjin Daily has successively received more than seventy letters of protest and condolence from various units or individual workers. The 20,000 workers of the Tianjin Branch of the Pingjin Railway Bureau wrote in their telegram: "When we heard this news, we were heartbroken, we were saddened, and we hated the Kuomintang bandit gang, who wield knives in their hands and shout 'peace' in their mouths, to the extreme!" They also stated: "We must transform grief into strength, refuel and repair roads and vehicles, support the people's liberation struggle, capture war criminals alive, and recover our blood debt."
    [Tangshan Telegram] Workers in various factories and mines in Tangshan signed petitions protesting the bloody atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit gang in slaughtering Shanghai transportation workers Gu Bokang, Zhong Quanzhou, and Wang Yuan, and donated money to support their class brothers and sisters who are persisting in the struggle in Shanghai. This movement was initiated by the representatives at a joint meeting of the worker representatives and group leaders of the Kaiping Tangshan mine's underground road workers on January 28th. When Comrade Zhao Qian of the Workers' Preparatory Committee reported the truth of the massacre at the meeting, the entire audience of workers was filled with grief and indignation. The workers unanimously vowed to avenge the dead. The meeting immediately decided to launch a signature protest movement. On the first day (March 1st), more than a thousand workers signed their names in front of the Kaiping Northwest and South gates in just two hours. By the second day, the number of signatures had reached more than seven thousand. Workers from the Jibei Electric Power Tangshan Branch, Tangshan Iron Factory, Tangshan Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Qixin Cement Company, Huaxin Textile Factory, Desheng Factory, and other factories in the city have also risen up in protest. More than seventy workers from the state-run Iron Factory saved 2,316,000 yuan (Great Wall currency) from their wages and remitted it to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to be transferred to the Shanghai workers.
