　　Ping 70th Arsenal Workers
    Enthusiastically Join the Trade Union
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Ping 70th Arsenal Trade Union Committee a month ago, it has organized training classes, cooperatives, and various other learning and welfare initiatives. In order to improve the lives of all workers in the factory, enhance political awareness, it has launched a vigorous movement to increase production and support the front lines. Now that the National Labor Congress is about to open in Beiping, and to establish the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions as soon as possible to participate in the National Congress, the preparatory committee has intensified the organization of a formal trade union. After work on the 19th, registration of members began, and more than 80 percent of the six workshops registered on the first day. Workers from the first workshop said: "Now that we have our own trade union, everything is guaranteed, and we have opportunities to learn."
