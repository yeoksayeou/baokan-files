Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 7th: TASS, Stockholm, March 4th: Hagberg, Chairman of the Communist Party caucus in the Swedish Parliament, said at the Peace Defense Conference in Värnamo that the bourgeoisie and the Social Democrats are increasingly openly declaring that they can no longer firmly maintain national sovereignty. However, the Communists say that Swedish national independence and the freedom of the Swedish people must be guaranteed and not be subjected to any infringement. The Soviet Union does not threaten Sweden. Hagberg stressed that, on the contrary, because the Soviet Union is fighting against the conspiracy to prepare a new imperialist war, it is today a strong guarantee of Sweden's peace and independence, just as it was during the Great War. In conclusion, Hagberg stressed that we must strive to change Sweden's foreign policy. Sweden should truly not participate in any alliance and should support the forces in the world that are fighting to consolidate peace and promote international cooperation.

    号召支持和平力量　保障瑞典民族独立
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩四日讯：瑞典国会共产党党团主席哈柏，在凡尔加摩市保卫和平大会上发言时说，资产阶级和社会党，正在愈来愈公开地宣称，他们不再能坚定地保持国家主权了。但是，共产党人说，必须保障瑞典的民族独立和瑞典人民的自由，不使受任何侵犯。苏联并不威胁瑞典。哈柏力称，相反的，因为苏联正在对准备新帝国主义战争的阴谋进行斗争，因而在今天，他也就是瑞典的和平与独立的坚强的保证，正如在大战时期一样。哈柏在结语中力称，我们必须努力改变瑞典的外交政策，瑞典应该真正不参加一切联盟，支持世界上为巩固和平与促进国际合作而奋斗的力量。
