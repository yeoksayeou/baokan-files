Several Experiences in the Resumption of Work in Langfang Cotton Industry
　　Jizhong Tenth Special District Research Group

　　I. The Evolution of Cotton Production in the Langfang Area

　　In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Hebei Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Association was established, and the Tianjin Cotton Planting Guidance Area was set up in Langfang, specializing in the promotion and improvement of cotton. In the same year, Tuozi cotton was promoted in the Langfang area. This cotton had a yield of 30 to 40 jin per mu higher than the local cotton (about 140 jin per mu). Cotton farmers praised it, and the planting area gradually increased from 10,000 to 20,000 mu to 40,000 to 50,000 mu. Until the 26th year, American Si Zi No. 4 cotton was introduced. This cotton was further improved in terms of quality, yield, and management compared to Tuozi cotton (about 200 jin per mu). In that year, the cotton planting area reached 90,000 mu, and the lint production exceeded 10,000 dan. During the Japanese invasion, the cotton production industry was severely damaged. The number of mu was restricted, the estimated yield was fixed at a public price, and forced purchases were made. Loans of seeds, fertilizers, food, and production funds were used as a prerequisite for controlling cotton production. The cotton field area increased to 120,000 mu, and the cotton price was as low as about one shi of corn for every 100 jin of seed cotton. After the Japanese surrender on August 15, it was ruled by the Kuomintang again. The Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was reorganized, and in the 35th year, the cotton field area was reduced to 50,000 mu. In the same year, American cotton Si Zi 2B cotton was introduced and planted on 6,000 mu, with better yield and quality than Si Zi No. 4 (over 200 jin per mu). About three shi of corn were worth about 100 jin of seed cotton, and cotton farmers gradually increased their cotton planting. In the 37th year, high-quality cotton increased to 30,000 mu, and ordinary cotton increased to 50,000 mu, with an estimated yield of about 10 million jin. With the expansion of cotton fields, the cotton ginning industry also gradually developed. There were a total of 26 cotton ginning factories in the town, with 9 power machines and 17 manual machines, employing 436 cotton ginning workers.

　　II. Resumption of Work After Liberation

　　On August 19, the Kuomintang reactionary government reformed the currency system and set price limits. Cotton farmers refused to sell, resulting in extreme market depression. Some workers and technicians fled one after another, and the Langfang cotton industry was once suspended. On December 14, Langfang was liberated. Due to the Kuomintang's deceptive propaganda, industrial and commercial households did not fully understand our Party's policies. In order to prosper the city, solve the problem of unemployed workers, and solve the problem of poor cotton farmers over the New Year, the Cotton Production Management Committee was organized under the guidance of the Military Control Commission to purchase cotton. From December 24th, for four consecutive days, a total of more than 100,700 jin of cotton were purchased. The living materials of more than 3,000 cotton selling households, about 25,000 people, were solved. Subsequently, a forum was held for workers, and workers were organized to organize the Cotton Production Improvement Office to repair engines and equip cotton ginning parts. After more than ten days of preparation, work was resumed on the sixth day of the first lunar month. Under the leadership of the state-owned cotton industry, private factories also resumed work one after another. At present, the daily output of lint is about 15,000 jin, and the lives of more than 500 male and female workers have been secured. The resumption of the cotton industry has opened up the sales channels for cotton, stabilized the morale of cotton farmers, and laid a solid foundation for expanding cotton fields this year.

　　III. Several Major Experiences in the Resumption of Work in Langfang Cotton Industry

　　(1) The rapid resumption of work in the Langfang cotton industry proves that not disrupting its original entire enterprise structure is a prerequisite for rapid resumption of work. After the liberation of Langfang, under the unified leadership of the Party, the entire improvement office was guarded, systematically taken over, and the old staff and technicians were appropriately adjusted and reappointed, and active workers were absorbed to participate in the leadership of the cotton reform office, achieving a complete and undamaged takeover of materials. By way of the town government and town trade union, poor workers were recruited to enter the factory. Except for slight repairs to the machines, no resistance was encountered in the resumption of work, thus quickly realizing the scheduled resumption plan.

　　(2) It is necessary to clearly define the state-owned economy as the leader and fight against the destructive actions of the joint cooperative economy and private merchants; but it must also be recognized that China's industry is still backward, and the private economy, which is conducive to the people's livelihood, is allowed to develop under the leadership of the state-owned economy, which is beneficial to the economic construction of New Democracy. Due to the vagueness of this point in concept, a hostile attitude was adopted towards private industry, which is the basic reason why Langfang's industry did not resume work in a timely manner. Later, it was clarified that the state-owned economy was the main body, driving the private industry that was conducive to the people's livelihood, promoting and implementing our industrial and commercial policies, clarifying the policy attitude towards private industry, eliminating their concerns, and providing practical driving and support. Yuanxiang and Dejuyong, which were squeezed out by bureaucratic capital in the past, signed contracts to resume work. Other private factories also resumed work one after another under the influence of Yuanxiang and Dejuyong.

　　(3) The experience of resumption of work in Langfang also proves that grasping the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and appropriately taking care of workers' welfare in many aspects, is a prerequisite for improving workers' production morale. The advancement office first stipulated a cross-progressive wage system, based on the general productivity of eight and a half hours of labor (tested to be 460 jin, each group of five cars, can roll 2,500 jin), and for every increase of one jin of seed cotton, an additional half tael of corn was issued. In order to solve the problem of consistent work hours, five cotton ginning cars were used as a unit, and the workers who fed the flowers and transported the flowers exchanged shifts in groups, and the increased salary was equally divided. Technicians and laborers also increased according to the proportion of general labor income. In addition, it is stipulated that there will be half an hour of study every day. In worker and staff meetings and activities and other systems, the factory provides each worker with a mask, apron, and goggles to take care of the health of the workers, and provides provisional wage advances for particularly poor workers. Female workers are paid during holidays or in special circumstances (illness, injury, or machine failure) when they cannot work for a certain period of time. (Those injured on the job are paid half a month's salary and treated by the factory. Sick leave for five days is paid, and after the period expires, the factory is only responsible for medical expenses.) A staff cooperative store is also set up to supply daily necessities at low prices. As a result, the morale of the workers has been unprecedentedly high, and it has spread throughout the factory: "Our good fortune has arrived. Without the Communist Party, we would have no food to eat." The disunity among workers and miners in the past has been disappearing, and production efficiency is increasing day by day. On February 9, the daily rolling was 4,380 jin, and on February 17, it increased to 7,969.5 jin. Workers also actively requested to purchase new machines, renovate houses, and expand capital accumulation.

　　(4) The experience of resumption of work in Langfang also proves that our leadership must clearly define that workers are the basic driving force for building the city, and at the same time strengthen workers' class education as masters of their own affairs, and combine it with improving workers' welfare, which is a favorable way to inspire workers' consciousness. In particular, we are very moved to absorb workers to participate in the management of the factory. When the machine broke down, the workers asked to pay half a month's less salary to purchase the machine. The phenomenon of workers wiping their buttocks with cotton in the past has also disappeared.

　　Although there are the above experiences, due to our lack of experience in mastering industry, the contradiction between power machine production and manual machine production has not yet been resolved (the same profit, manual machine is not profitable), and how to manage the factory and other issues, we still need to continue to study in the future.

　　廊坊棉业复工的几点经验
    冀中第十专署研究组
    一、廊坊区棉产沿革
    民国二十三年成立河北省棉产改进会，在廊坊设天津植棉指导区，专办棉花推广改进工作。当年推广脱字棉于廊坊一带，该棉较本地棉每亩产量高出三四十斤（每亩一百四十斤左右），棉农称赞，面积逐渐增多，由一、二万亩突增至四、五万亩。直至二十六年，美种斯字四号棉传入，该棉在质量上、产量上、管理上，又较脱字棉更进一步（每亩二百斤左右），是年棉产面积达九万亩，皮棉产量超出一万市担。日寇进犯，棉产事业倍受摧残，限制亩数，预估产量公定价格，强迫收买，通过贷放种籽、肥料、食粮、生产款，作为统治棉产的前提，棉田面积增至十二万亩，棉价低至每百斤籽棉玉米一石左右。八一五日本投降，又为国民党所统治，改组农林部棉产改进处，三十五年棉田减至五万亩。是年输入美棉斯字二Ｂ棉播种六千亩，产量品质较斯字四号尤佳（每亩二百斤以上）。每百斤籽棉约值玉米三石左右，棉农植棉逐渐增多。三十七年良种棉增至三万亩，普通棉增至五万亩，产量估计在千万斤左右。随着棉田的扩大，轧花工业也逐渐发展，全镇共轧花厂二十六家，动力机九，人力机十七，轧花工人四百三十六人。
    二、解放后复工情况
    “八一九”国民党反动政府改革币制，限定物价，棉农拒售，结果造成市面极度萧条，部份工人和技师相继逃亡，廊坊棉业一度停业。十二月十四日，廊坊解放，由于国民党欺骗宣传，工商业户对于我党政策不甚了解。为繁荣城市，解决失业工人问题，解决贫苦棉农过年问题，在军管会指导下，组织棉产管理委员会，收买棉花。自十二月二十四日起，前后四日，共收买棉花十万零七千余斤，卖花户约三千多户，约二万五千以上人口生活资料得到解决。遂即召集工人座谈会，组织工人组织棉产改进处，修理发动机，装备轧花零件，经过十余天的准备，于正月初六复工。在国营棉业带动下，私厂也先后复工。现每日产皮棉一万五千斤左右，五百余男女工人生活得到了寄托。由于棉业的复工，打开了棉花的销路，稳定棉农情绪，打下了今年扩大棉田有力基础。
    三、廊坊棉业复工的几点主要经验
    （一）廊坊棉业迅速复工，经验证明，不打乱其旧有的全部企业机构是迅速复工的先决条件，廊坊解放后，在党的统一领导下，对改进处全部看管，有系统地接收并分别适当地调整任用旧有职员技师，及吸收积极工人参加棉改处的领导，达到了对物资的完整无损的接管，并通过镇公所镇工会招收贫困工人入厂，除机器略加修理外，复工未遇到任何阻力，因此迅速实现了预订复工计划。
    （二）必需明确国营经济为领导，联合合作经济和私商的破坏性作斗争；但又必须认识中国工业尚属落后，有利于国民生计的私人经济，在国营经济领导下，允其发展，对新民主主义的经济建设是有利的。由于对此点在观念上模糊，对私人工业采取敌视态度，这是廊坊工业未及时复工的基本原因。后明确以国营为主体，带动有利于国民生计的私营工业宣传贯彻我工商业政策，明确对私营工业的政策态度，消除其顾虑，并予以切实带动扶植，过去为官僚资本排挤的源祥、德聚永，遂订立合同复工，其他私厂在源祥、德聚永的影响下也先后复工。
    （三）廊坊复工经验又证明，掌握劳资两利政策下，从多方面适当照顾工人福利，是提高工人生产情绪的必备条件。推进处首先规定交叉累进工资制，按八小时半的劳动一般生产率（经试验为四百六十斤，每组五辆车子，可轧二千五百斤）为准、每增轧子棉一斤，增发半两玉米。为解决上下班一致的问题，以五辆轧花车为单位，喂花运花工人伙组换工，增资部份均分，技师工役也按一般劳力所得比例增加。另外规定每日半小时学习。工人职工会议活动等制度，厂方为照顾工人健康，每人发给口罩、围裙、风镜各一，特贫困工人酌情预发工资，女工假期或因特殊情况（病伤、因机器发生故障）在一定时间不能工作者，照发工资。（因工受伤的照发半月工资，由厂方医治，病假五日照发工资，超过期者，厂方只负责医药费）另组有职工合作社商店，低价供给生活日用品。这样一来，工人情绪空前高涨，厂内遍传：“咱福气到啦，没有共产党咱就没饭吃。”过去工人间不团结、矿工等现象，都被消失着，生产效率日增。二月九日每日轧四三八○斤，十七日增至七九六九点五斤。工人并积极要求购制新机器，增修房舍，要求扩大资本积累。
    （四）廊坊复工经验又证明，我们领导思想上必须明确工人是建设城市的基本动力，同时加强工人主人翁的阶级教育，并与改善工人福利相结合，是启发工人自觉的有利方式。特别我们吸收工人参加工厂的管理，工人颇为感动。机器坏了工人要求少支半月薪水购制机器。过去工人用棉花擦屁股的现象也绝迹了。
    虽有以上经验，但也由于我们对掌握工业缺乏经验，对动力机生产与人力机生产矛盾尚未解决（一样的利润，人力机就没利），以及如何管理工厂诸问题，还需要我们今后继续研究。
