　　The Murderers Must Not Be Pardoned!
　　Forty-One Bodies Discovered at the Former Site of the Kuomintang Secret Service in Shenyang
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 27th] While cleaning up the garbage at the former site of the Kuomintang secret service supervision office, the garrison troops here recently discovered forty-one bodies buried underground. They immediately reported this to the Municipal Government, and all the bodies were exhumed. According to the examination results, although the bodies had begun to decompose, their faces were still vaguely recognizable. All were young people in their twenties, and a large portion were patriotic students from the city. Among them, there were two female corpses, clearly having been murdered by Kuomintang secret agents. The Municipal Government has now photographed them, placed them in coffins, and announced this for the families of the victims to identify them. A memorial service will be held on a selected date for their burial.

    沈阳前国民党特务机关旧址发现尸体四十一具
    【新华社长春二十七日电】此间卫戍部队日前在清扫前国民党特务机关督察处旧址的垃圾时，发现地下埋有尸首四十一具。当即向市政府报告，一一起出。据检验结果，各尸体虽已开始腐烂，但面目仍可依稀辨认，均系二十余岁之青年人，一大部分是该市爱国学生，其中，有女尸两具，显系被国民党特务残害。现市府已将拍照后装棺，一面公告被难家属认领，一面择日安葬，并将举行追悼会。
