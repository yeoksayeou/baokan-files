　　【Ping City News】In order to assist citizens in learning new culture, the Municipal Library previously organized mobile reading stations throughout the city. Since its opening, it has received applications from approximately thirty units. Following the principle of "workers' labor groups being established first," the library has successively established ten stations, issuing over a thousand types of books and magazines. The total number of people at all mobile stations has reached 10,044. The library is still continuing to accept applications. Worker and labor groups wishing to apply can send personnel directly to the library for contact. Furthermore, the library's reading room has recently received a large batch of new cultural books, which, together with the previous holdings, amounts to over four hundred types. All circles are welcome to read them. (The library is located at 22 Toufa Hutong, Xuannei, telephone (2) 0825)
