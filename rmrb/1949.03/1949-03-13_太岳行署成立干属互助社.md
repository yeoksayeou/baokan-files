　　Taiyue Administrative Office Establishes Mutual Aid Society for Cadre Dependents
    [Taiyue Electricity] The Taiyue Administrative Office, in order to solve the difficulties of the families of机关 cadres, established a mutual aid society for the families of cadres in November of last year. One hundred and twenty family members of cadres voluntarily joined the society. The mutual aid society's store does not charge handling fees, provides members with raw materials for production, and sells finished products produced by members on their behalf. Among them, sixteen members run sundry goods stalls. The mutual aid society allows them to take goods first and repay the money after selling the goods. It is stipulated that quick-selling goods will yield a profit of one percent, while slow-selling goods will be at cost. They also solicit work from various organizations and distribute it to members in a planned way. For example, in November of last year, they made one hundred and fourteen sets of cotton uniforms for the Telephone Bureau, earning a salary of 124,800 yuan (Jicha). Members can solicit some business every month. When there is less business to solicit, the mutual aid society lends the members 160 jin of thread. The members themselves have five hosiery machines, and the society sells them cotton yarn at cost and promotes their finished products at market prices. Although this has solved many difficulties for the families of the cadres, it still cannot further organize the families and carry out production in a planned way. Later, the administrative office decided to allocate 200 shi of millet from the relief grain for the families of directly affiliated organizations as a fund to establish a family factory. After more than a month of preparation, the family factory officially started work on February 17 this year. At the beginning, there were only two or thirty people, and by the end of February, it had increased to seventeen people. The factory's production revolves around two hosiery machines and two towel machines, mainly spinning yarn, and wages are calculated on a piecework basis. From February 17th to the end of the month, 108 workdays were completed, earning 348,000 yuan. After deducting food expenses, there was a surplus of 16,000 yuan. The highest earners could earn 7,500 yuan in three days after deducting food expenses, and the average earners could earn enough to eat, or have a slight surplus.

　　太岳行署成立干属互助社
    【太岳电】太岳行署为解决机关干部家属困难，去年十一月成立了干部家属互助社，自愿入社的干部家属有一百二十人。互助社门市部不收手续费，供给社员生产原料，代卖社员生产成品。其中十六个社员是摆杂货摊的，互助社允许他们先拿货，卖了货再还款，规定快货按一分出利，慢货照原本。他们还向各机关揽活，有计划的分配给社员去作。如去年十一月给电话局作了一百一十四套棉制服，就赚了十二万四千八百元（冀钞下同）工资。每月社员都能揽做一些营生。在揽收营生少的时候，互助社又给社员们贷了一百六十斤线。社员们自己有五架织袜机，社里按成本卖给他们棉线，按市价替她们推销成品。这样虽然给干部家属解决了不少困难，可是还不能更进一步把家属组织起来，有计划的进行生产。后经行署决定：从直属机关家属救济粮里，拨出二百石小米来作为基金，创办家属工厂。经过一个多月的筹备，家属工厂从今年二月十七日正式开工。开始只有两三十人，二月底增加到十七个人。工厂的生产，围绕着两架织袜机和两架毛巾机，以纺线为主，按件计算工资。从二月十七号到月底，作了一百零八个工，赚了三十四万八千元，除了开支伙食外，剩余一万六千元。最高的除下伙食，三天能赚七千五百元，一般的也都够吃，或稍有剩余。
