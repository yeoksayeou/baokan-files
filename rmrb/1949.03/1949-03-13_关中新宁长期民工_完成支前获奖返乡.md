Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. The long-term labor and stretcher team from Xinning County (newly established county), Guanzhong Sub-region, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, completed their mission of supporting the front lines and returned home with the "Model Laborer" award banner. The team of eighty-five members rushed to the front lines last autumn and made numerous achievements during their service. During the Weibei Campaign and the battle of Zhenshi last year, the stretcher team encountered the enemy while carrying eleven wounded soldiers. The team members bravely carried the wounded to the mountains to avoid danger and brought them all back. In the battle of Yongfeng Town, the labor squad leader Lei Guanglu, regardless of the enemy's dense artillery fire, led three stretchers into the darkness of night to the outside of the fortress and rescued eighteen wounded soldiers in six consecutive trips. Laborer Guo Rongcai, braving stray bullets, voluntarily went to the front line and carried a wounded soldier back from under the city. He also turned over pens and coins he picked up on the battlefield. During the Kangzhuang battle, because the picket line of their detachment was long, squad leader Lei Guanglu led six members to help the troops stand guard all night. Many team members received awards at the commendation meeting.

　　关中新宁长期民工
  　完成支前获奖返乡
    【新华社延安十日电】陕甘宁边区关中分区新宁县（新设县）长期民工担架队完成支援前线任务，荣获“民工范例”奖旗返乡。该队八十五名队员于去秋赶赴前线，在服役期间屡建功绩。去年渭北战役与市镇战斗后，该担架队抬了十一名伤员中途与敌遭遇，队员们奋力将伤员抬至山上避过危险，全部抬回。永丰镇战斗中民工分队长雷光禄不顾敌人密集炮火，在黑夜里带领三付担架到塞外底下连续六次抢救出十八名伤员。民工郭荣财冒着流弹，自动摸上火线，从城下背回一伤员，他还把在战场上拾的水笔、金钱交公。在康庄战斗中，因他们所在的那个支队警戒线较长，分队长雷光禄便带领六名队员帮助部队放哨一夜。许多队员在评功会上得功受奖。
