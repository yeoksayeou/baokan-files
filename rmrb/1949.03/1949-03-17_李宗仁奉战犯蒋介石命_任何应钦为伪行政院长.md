Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th—Li Zongren, the puppet acting president of the Kuomintang government, appointed He Yingqin as the puppet Executive Yuan President on the 12th, succeeding Sun Ke. The reason for the delay in the appointment of the puppet Executive Yuan President was that this appointment had to be approved by Chiang Kai-shek, the number one war criminal and leader of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Even before Sun Ke's resignation, Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin had gone to Fenghua on the 3rd on behalf of Li Zongren to see Chiang Kai-shek. It is said that the mission of Zhang and Wu was to "invite Chiang Kai-shek to go abroad," but in fact, it was to beg Chiang Kai-shek for "understanding" of Li Zongren's political plans, including the appointment of the puppet Executive Yuan President. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 11th, He Yingqin's nomination was a direct result of Chiang Kai-shek's approval, and the list was submitted to Chiang Kai-shek by Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin. From this, it can be seen that Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, He Yingqin, and others are nothing more than characters in the palm of Chiang Kai-shek, who is "hiding" behind the scenes. The Li Zongren clique is now striving for the cooperation of Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies in order to put on a grand show in front of the Chinese people to bargain, and the so-called bargaining is to use false peace to resist genuine peace.

### 李宗仁奉战犯蒋介石命　任何应钦为伪行政院长

　　李宗仁奉战犯蒋介石命
  　任何应钦为伪行政院长
    【新华社陕北十五日电】国民党政府伪代总统李宗仁已于十二日任命何应钦继系孙科为伪行政院长。伪行政院长的任命之所以迟延，是因为这个任命必须取得国民党反动派首领第一号战争罪犯蒋介石的批准。还在孙科辞职以前，张治中、吴忠信二人即曾于三日代表李宗仁去奉化见蒋介石。张吴二人的使命传说是要“请蒋介石出国”，其实是为了乞求蒋介石对于李宗仁政治计划的“谅解”，包括伪行政院长的任命在内。据路透社南京十一日电称：何应钦的提名是蒋介石批准的直接结果，名单系由张治中与吴忠信呈交蒋介石。由此可见，李宗仁、张治中、何应钦之流都不外是“隐居”幕后的蒋介石掌心中的角色。李宗仁集团现正力求蒋介石及其党羽的合作，以便在中国人民面前装得大模大样地来讲价钱，所谓讲价钱就是以假和平来对抗真和平。
