　　The East China Liberated Area delegation attending the First National Women's Congress has arrived in Beiping. The delegation consists of sixty-six representatives, representing 25.5 million women from the liberated areas of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. This is a region with a long history of struggle. For more than ten years, from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the People's Liberation War, women, together with men, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have waged heroic and arduous struggles against the enemy. They defeated the enemy, tempered themselves, and produced a large number of outstanding female cadres and heroic models. These sixty-six representatives are typical figures among the vast number of women in East China.

　　The East China region was once the focus of attacks by Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. Women in this environment suffered even more cruel persecution. However, women countered the enemy with persistent struggles, actively participating in and supporting the revolutionary war.

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders inhumanly implemented "netting tactics," "iron wall encirclement," "comb-like sweeps," "rural clearing," and the "Three Alls Policy" in the East China liberated areas, attempting to eliminate the most resolute anti-Japanese forces. At this time, women not only had to engage in production but also had to directly participate in the war. Some female cadres led local armed forces to wage guerrilla warfare. Sun Yumin, one of the representatives attending the congress, is a vivid example. She grew up in a village in Haiyang County, Shandong Province. Angered by the enemy's brutal burning and killing, she resolved to practice martial arts for revenge at the age of sixteen. At seventeen, she began to participate in combat, learned shooting and explosives, and even killed seventeen Japanese soldiers. Now she is only twenty-two years old and is a working rural woman.

　　During the two and a half years of the People's Liberation War, the East China region again became the focus of enemy attacks. In the first year of the Liberation War, most of the Jiangsu liberated area fell. The vast number of women persisted in their struggle behind enemy lines, universally resisting rape and arson, and fighting the enemy with arms. Representative Liu Hucheng is a representative figure of this region and this period. She herself served as the secretary of the CCP branch in a township, leading armed forces to fight the enemy. She is a poor peasant who had just been liberated. Her father-in-law served as the village chief of a village, and her husband served as the township chief of a township. Her father-in-law and husband were arrested and heroically sacrificed. But she did not waver and fought more bravely. Leading armed forces, she persisted for two and a half years, finally forcing the enemy out of their stronghold. Half a district, under her leadership, persisted in the mass struggle against the enemy.

　　In the second year of the People's Liberation War, the Kuomintang bandit army concentrated eighty-three divisions to launch a key offensive against Shandong. The broad masses of peasants left their homes, carrying the wounded, transporting supplies, bullets, and ammunition. Women in the rear sewed military uniforms, made straw sandals, and ground military flour, solving the difficulties of the troops in combat. In Lunan Central Shandong, an administrative office area of peasant women, in three months they made three million pairs of military shoes. At the most tense time of the war, the women there ground three million catties of grain every day to supply the troops. Many women directly participated in civilian labor to support the front. Representative Dong Lisheng is a model figure in this work. She is the stretcher squad leader of the Zhuting stretcher regiment. The Zhuting County stretcher regiment was known as the "steel stretcher regiment." She was selected as a first-class merit recipient in this stretcher regiment.

　　During the war, tens of thousands of liberated peasants poured into the army. After each battle, tens of thousands of prisoners were sent to the rear. The need for bedding increased greatly. Rear service factories received rush tasks one after another. The workers highly developed their class consciousness. Working day and night, female and male workers launched revolutionary competitions. Mao Shanxian, one of the representatives, when the factory proposed the red flag movement, led a female worker class to compete with nine male worker classes. With high revolutionary enthusiasm, they worked hard to produce, and after four evaluations, finally won the red flag banner.

　　At the front, a large number of women participated in medical work. At the most tense time of the war, they treated and rescued on the front lines at the same time. When necessary, they personally carried stretchers, doing the work of several people. When wounded soldiers were in life-threatening danger, they resolutely gave their own blood to the wounded soldiers. Representative Jiang Nanping is a typical figure among these outstanding medical personnel.

　　In the rear, because a large number of men went out to participate in the war, there was a shortage of labor. The women resolutely took on the task of agricultural production. In the areas with the heaviest war service burdens, such as both sides of the highway from Feixian County to Yishui County in Shandong, 90 percent of the women participated in field labor. The women were not accustomed to cultivating the land. Zhang Zhengfang, one of the representatives attending the meeting, under the call of the local Communist Party and government, first learned to cultivate the land and promoted more than 400 women to learn as well.

　　During the most arduous period of war support, local district, township, and village cadres departed in batches, leading civilian laborers to participate in the war. Female cadres were urgently needed to participate in government work. Many regions universally elected female village chiefs, female township chiefs, female district chiefs, and even female county chiefs. Representative Han Xiuzhen was a woman who had begged for food for twenty-three years. In the liberated area, she found a way out of production, was elected as a labor hero, and was recommended to be the district chief of Chenhu District in Boxing County. She was rated as a first-class merit recipient during her tenure as district chief.

　　Intellectual women in East China have also had the opportunity to develop their talents, contributing their strength in various work positions. For example, representative Qian Zhengying, a student in the Civil Engineering Department of Datong University, saw that women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were excluded and played with, unable to use what they had learned, so she decided to come to the liberated area. She was quickly assigned to an appropriate work position, participating in highway construction projects and water conservancy projects. Now she has become one of the outstanding talents in water conservancy engineering, serving as the deputy director of the Bohai River Affairs Bureau. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, with the enthusiastic participation of the masses, she fully exerted her talents and successfully rescued the Yellow River twice, relieving millions of people from disaster.

　　The women's work in East China was developed under the leadership of the Communist Party and through the selfless work of a large number of female cadres. Comrades such as Chen Shaomin, Li Jianzhen, Zhang Yun, and Qiu Yi, who are attending this meeting, have all gone through several periods: the Great Revolution, land reform, the 25,000-mile Long March, secret work, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War, and have been tempered into strong leading cadres and models for women in the flames of struggle.

　　The sixty-six representatives of the East China Women's Delegation, each of whom is an outstanding member of the women's population, were repeatedly elected by the various regions to represent 25.5 million women to participate in the congress. They attach great importance to their responsibilities and are all prepared to learn experience from other regions at this Women's Congress, and to bring the spirit of the congress back to East China to better develop women's work in East China.

　　出席全国妇代大会
  　华东代表团介绍
    出席全国妇女第一次代表大会的华东解放区代表团已经到了北平。代表共有六十六位，代表着山东、江苏、河南、安徽解放区的二千五百五十万妇女。那是一个久经战斗的地方。从抗日战争到人民解放战争，十多年来，妇女们和男人们一道，在共产党领导下，和敌人进行了英勇艰苦的斗争。她们战胜了敌人，锻炼了自己，大批优秀的妇女干部与英雄模范涌现出来，这六十六位代表、正是华东广大妇女中的典型人物。
    华东地区曾经是日本帝国主义与蒋匪军进攻的重点，妇女在这种环境中，受到更残酷的迫害，但是，妇女们以坚持不懈的战斗来对付敌人，顽强地参加与支援了革命战争。
    在抗日战争中，日寇惨无人道的对华东解放区实行了拉网战术、铁壁合围、梳篦扫荡、清乡和三光政策，想肃清抗日最坚决的部队，这时妇女不但要生产，还必须直接参加战争，有的妇女干部带领地方武装打游击。这次出席大会的代表之一孙玉敏，就是一个生动的例子。她生长在山东海阳县的一个村庄里，愤于敌人残酷的烧杀，十六岁时即决心练武复仇，十七岁开始参加战斗，学会了射击和爆炸，也曾经打死过十七名日本兵，现在她才二十二岁，是一个劳动的农村妇女。
    在两年半的人民解放战争中，华东地区又成为敌人进攻的重点，在解放战争的第一年，江苏解放区大部沦陷，广大妇女即在敌后坚持斗争，普遍地进行反强奸，反烧杀，并以武装对敌作战，代表刘虎成正是这一地区这一时期的代表人物，她自己在一个乡担任中共支部书记，带领了武装与敌人斗争，她是一个刚翻身的赤贫农。她的公公担任着一村的村长，丈夫做一个乡的乡长。她的公公与丈夫先后被捕，英勇牺牲。但她毫不动摇，越战越勇带着武装一直坚持了两年半，最后逼走了敌人的据点，有半个区在她领导下，坚持了群众对敌斗争。
    人民解放战争的第二年，国民党匪军曾集中八十三个师，对山东展开了重点进攻。广大的农民离开自己的家乡，担送伤员，运输给养、子弹、军火，妇女在后方缝军衣，作草鞋，磨军面，解决部队作战的困难，鲁中南一个行署区的农妇，在三个月中即作军鞋三百万双，在战争最紧张时，那里的妇女曾每日磨粮三百万斤供应部队。许多妇女更直接参加民工出外支前。代表董力生，即是这一工作的模范人物。她是竹庭担架团的担架班长，竹庭县担架团中曾得到钢铁担架团的称号，她在这一担架团中，被选为一等功臣。
    在战争中，成千成万的翻身农民涌入部队，每一战役之后，成千成万的俘虏送到后方，被服的需要大增，后方被服厂接二连三的接到突击任务。工人们高度的发扬了阶级觉悟。日以继夜的作工，女工和男工展开了革命竞赛。代表之一的毛珊仙当厂方提出红旗运动时，领导着一个女工班与九个男子班比赛，他们以高度的革命热情，努力生产，经过四次评奖，最后夺得红旗锦标。
    在前方，大批妇女参加医务工作，战争最紧张的时候，他们一面医治，一面火线抢救，必要时亲自抬担架，一个人作几个人的工作，遇到伤员有性命危险时，坚决把自己的血输给伤员，代表蒋南屏即是这些优秀的医务人员中的典型人物。
    在后方，因大批男子出外参战，劳力缺乏，妇女们毅然担负起农业生产的任务。在战勤最繁重的地方，如山东费县到沂水县的公路两侧，百分之九十的妇女参加田野劳动。妇女们是不习惯耕地的，到会代表之一张正芳，在当地共产党与政府的号名下，首先学会耕地，并推动四百余妇女也学会了。
    在支援战争最繁重的时候，地方区、乡、村干部一批批的出发，带领民工参战，女干部亟需参加政权工作，许多地区普遍的选出了女村长，女乡长，女区长，以至女县长，代表韩秀珍是一个讨了二十三年饭的妇女，在解放区找到了生产的出路，被选为劳动英雄，又被推派为博兴县陈户区区长，在区长任内被评了一等功。
    华东地区的知识妇女，亦都得到了发挥自己才能的机会，在各种工作岗位上供献自己的力量，例如代表钱正英，她是大同大学土木工程系的学生，在她将要学成的日子，她看到国民党统治区的妇女被排斥，被玩弄、学不能用，于是决心到解放区来。她很快的被分配在适当的工作岗位上，参加公路修筑工程和水利工程，现在已成为水利工程工作中杰出人材之一，担任渤海河务局副局长的职务，在共产党与民主政府领导下，在群众踊跃参加下，她充分发挥了自己的才干，两次黄河抢险成功，解除了数百万人民的灾难。
    华东的妇女工作，是在共产党的领导下，经过大批妇女干部忘我的工作而开展起来的。象这次到会的代表陈少敏、李坚贞、章蕴、邱一等同志，都是经过大革命、土地改革、二万五千里长征、秘密工作、抗日战争、人民解放战争几个时期，在斗争的烈火中，锻炼成坚强的领导干部，妇女的表率。
    华东妇女代表团的六十六位代表，每一个人都是妇女中的优秀分子，经过各地区的反复选举，代表二千五百五十万妇女来参加大会，她们十分重视自己的责任，都准备在这次妇女代表大会上向其他地区学习经验，并把大会精神带回华东地区，更好的开展华东妇女工作。
