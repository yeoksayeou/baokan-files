(Jidong Electric) The Jidong Administrative Office Production and Supply Department held a conference of industrial labor heroes and model workers from its subordinate units on March 1st in a certain place in Zunhua. A total of thirty people attended, and they reported their heroic achievements to the conference. For example, Liu Zhenyuan, the director of Hongda Water Mill, established a water-powered flour mill despite difficulties, invented the "grain cleaning machine," and renovated the blower. He also meticulously studied his work, increasing the output per grinding from 550 jin to 1,200 jin per day, and reduced manpower, decreasing the factory staff from 52 to 26. Li Kepu, a technician at the Hujiatuo Distillery in the Lunan sub-district (south of the Beining Railway), enthusiastically taught his quick-fermentation method to others, training five quick-fermentation masters in eight months. Since the distillery started using quick-fermentation, the raw materials were changed from food grains to wheat bran, reducing costs by half, and the fermentation time was also greatly reduced. Sun Shuyuan, a technical worker at the Xingye Printing Factory, bravely jumped into the fire to rescue kerosene when a diesel engine caught fire, preventing the fire from spreading to the warehouse and averting huge losses. Although he was seriously injured and sometimes even fainted, he still did not forget to renovate the machine and teach the technique to others when he was awake. Li Weian, an apprentice at the Iron Factory, respected technicians, learned humbly, and mastered "fire watching" in five months (previously it took two years to learn), fulfilling the duties of a technician. Wei Xun, a technician at the Yumin Leather Factory, improved his techniques through hard work despite using crude tools, increasing leather production from 20 sheets to 90 sheets per month, and reducing the cost from 280 jin of rice per sheet to 140 jin. After the representatives reported, they divided into groups for discussion and evaluation, and finally selected one special-class model worker, one special-class labor hero, four first-class labor heroes, and six second-class labor heroes.

　　冀东行署生产供给处
  　评选工业劳动英雄
    【冀东电】冀东行署生产供给处三月一日在遵化某地举行所属各单位的工业劳动英雄及模范工作者大会，出席共三十人，纷向大会报告其英雄业绩。如宏达水磨厂厂长刘振远，在困难中建立了水力磨面，发明“净麦机”，改造了风弓，并精心钻研业务，使每盘磨的产量由每天五百五十斤增加到一千二百斤；并节省了人力，工厂人员由五十二名减为二十六名。路南分区（北宁铁路南侧）的胡家坨酒厂技工李克普，把自己的快面制法热心教给别人，八个月里培养出五个快面师。该酒厂自使用快面后，原料由食粮改为麸子，成本减低一半，造面时间亦大大缩减。兴业印刷厂技术工人孙书元，在柴油机失火时，奋不顾身跳入火中抢出煤油，使火势没有延及库房，免去巨大损失。他本人虽受重伤，有时竟晕迷过去，但醒来仍不忘改造机器，将技术教给旁人。铁工厂学徒李维安尊敬技师，虚心学习，五个月即学会“看火”（从前需二年时间才能学会），执行了技师的职务。裕民皮革厂技师魏勋，虽使用粗劣工具，经努力改良技术，把皮革的产量由每月的二十张增加到九十张，成本由每张二百八十斤米减低为一百四十斤。代表们报告后，分组进行评议讨论，最后选出特等模范工作者一名，特等劳动英雄一名，甲等劳动英雄四名，乙等劳动英雄六名。
