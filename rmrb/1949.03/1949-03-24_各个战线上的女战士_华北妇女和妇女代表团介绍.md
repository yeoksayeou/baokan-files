　　Women Warriors on All Fronts
　　An Introduction to Women in North China and the Women's Delegation
　　The North China Liberated Area Women's Delegation consists of one hundred and twenty-two representatives, making it the largest delegation. They come from eleven regions including Taihang, Taiyue, Chahar, Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Beiping, and Taiyuan, representing over thirty million women in North China. Among them are sixteen female workers, fifteen peasant women, as well as female county heads, county party secretaries, female commissioners, heads of departments in the North China People's Government, and female staff members in other various positions. Eight of them are models of production, supporting the army, and fighting the enemy, and most of the others are female revolutionaries who have undergone long-term arduous struggles. Each of them has a moving story of hard work and glorious heroic deeds.
　　They excitedly talked about how the North China Liberated Area was created through hardship; how they persisted in the struggle with the women of North China. In the guerrilla warfare environment, they stood guard, watched, cared for and rescued the wounded and sick, made military shoes, sewed military uniforms, cleared the fields and fortified the walls... Persisting in guerrilla warfare, resisting "sweeps" and "tunnel" warfare. Li Xingge, one of the representatives from Central Hebei attending this conference, known as the "Mother of the Soldiers," is a model of North China women supporting the front.
　　When Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gangs cruelly destroyed agricultural production in rural North China and implemented an economic blockade, the lack of cloth became the biggest difficulty in the lives of the vast number of soldiers and civilians in North China. Coupled with severe famines in some areas, the women of North China rose up to participate in textile production to complete the arduous task of "self-sufficiency in production" and "production for famine relief." In the vast areas of Taihang, Taiyue, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the famines of 1942 and 1943 were mostly overcome by women's textile production organized by cooperatives. According to statistics, in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, about one-third of the people relied on women's textile production to solve their livelihood problems during the famine. In 1947, the Taihang District launched a "Hundred-Day Textile" campaign, mobilizing 744,634 women to participate in textile production (accounting for 74% of the region's female labor force), weaving a total of 7.6 million jin of cloth, supplying clothing for the region's soldiers and civilians. From the perspective of the average number of women engaged in textile production per county throughout the year, 1947 increased nearly tenfold compared to 1943. Women in vast areas of North China participated in textile production, and in many areas, everyone could spin and every household could weave. The entire North China Liberated Area has achieved self-sufficiency in clothing with a surplus. Countless textile models have emerged in textile production. Many women have bought houses and land through textile production, and women have set up their own property with their own hands. Taking a village in Yutian County, Eastern Hebei, with more than 200 households as an example, there are actually more than a dozen households. Now everywhere it is said: "In the past, whoever had a family suffered, but now whoever has a wife will not go hungry." Those who survived the famine thanks to their wives' textile production are even more grateful, saying: "If it weren't for women's textile production, we would have starved to death long ago."
　　With the development of the People's Liberation War, a large number of young and middle-aged men in rural areas joined the army or supported the front. Under the slogans of "Men win battles on the front, women produce in the rear" and "Men establish military merits on the front, women establish wealth merits in the rear," women in North China enthusiastically participated in agricultural production. After the land reform, women's enthusiasm for production was even higher, and they shouldered the major task of restoring and developing agricultural production in the liberated areas together with male farmers. In the southern section of the Beining Railway in Eastern Hebei, women's participation in agricultural labor reached 90% of the female labor force. In areas around Shen County in Central Hebei, women universally participated in agricultural labor, becoming the most basic main force. In Taiyue, Taihang, and Chahar regions, it generally reached 40% to 50%. In 1947, women and children in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area undertook 30% to 40% of the labor force in the region's agricultural production, completing production tasks and supporting the war. Many women learned "all-around skills" in agricultural production, and many labor hero models emerged in labor. At the conference of male and female labor models held in Eastern Hebei this spring, nine labor models were selected, six of whom were women. Zhao Huilan, a representative from Eastern Hebei attending this conference, was repeatedly elected as a first-class production model in the Thirteenth Sub-district for two consecutive years. She herself cultivated 29 mu of land and solved the clothing problem for her family of four through textile production. Under her influence, about 2,000 women nearby learned "all-around skills." The saying "Women and mothers accomplish great things" has changed many people's feudal views of despising women.
　　With the improvement of women's economic status, women's social knowledge and ability to manage society have also improved. They can be masters of the house at home, make their own decisions in marriage, and manage government affairs in the village. Not only that, but rural women cadres are scattered in various positions in districts, counties, and special commissioner's offices. According to statistics of women cadres in the Taihang, Taiyue, and Eastern Hebei regions, among 1,148 people, cadres from rural women accounted for 805 people. In Eastern Hebei alone, there were more than 230 districts, and 500 to 600 new women cadres were promoted last year. There are also a considerable number of educated women who, through their long-term immersion in the worker-peasant masses and serving them together with the working people, have been tempered, thus transforming themselves and gradually moving towards worker-peasantization, gaining their own thorough liberation from the depths of their minds. More than half of the representatives in the North China Women's Delegation are outstanding examples of this combination of educated women and working people.
　　Due to the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, North China has successively liberated major cities such as Shijiazhuang, Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding. Especially in places like Ping, Tianjin, and Baoding, although they are newly liberated, they have quickly worked actively among female workers and urban working women, making not small contributions to the current production and construction and supporting the front. At the same time, this is also the central point of North China's women's work in the future, that is, how to combine the women's work in the newly liberated big cities with the vast rural areas of the old liberated areas, and move forward together.

　　各个战线上的女战士
    华北妇女和妇女代表团介绍
    华北解放区妇女代表团是由一百二十二位代表组成的，是各地代表团中最大的一个代表团。她们来自太行、太岳、察哈尔、冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫、石家庄、天津、北平和太原等十一个地区，代表着华北三千多万妇女。她们当中有十六位女工，十五位农妇，还有女县长、县委书记、女专员、华北人民政府厅长等及其他各种工作岗位上的女工作人员，她们中有八位是生产、拥军与对敌斗争模范，另外大多数都是经过长期艰苦奋斗的女革命者。她们每个人都有着使人感动的艰苦奋斗的经历和光荣的英模事迹。
    她们兴奋地谈论着华北解放区是怎样艰辛地创建起来的；她们如何地和华北妇女在一起坚持斗争。在游击战争环境，她们站岗、放哨、看护与抢护伤病员、做军鞋、缝军衣、坚壁清野……坚持游击战，反“扫荡”和“地道”斗争。这次出席大会冀中代表之一，被称为“子弟兵的母亲”的李杏阁，就是华北妇女的支前的典范。
    当日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮：对华北农村生产残酷地摧毁又实行经济封锁的情况下，布匹的缺乏，成为广大的华北军民生活中最大的困难。加上某些地区严重的灾荒，华北的妇女奋起参加了纺织生产，来完成了“生产自给”、“生产救荒”这一艰巨的任务。太行、太岳、冀鲁豫广大地区一九四二与四三年的灾荒，大部分地区都是靠合作社组织妇女纺织而渡过的，据统计：冀鲁豫在渡荒中靠妇女纺织解决生活困难的占三分之一左右。一九四七年太行区展开“百日纺织”运动，发动了七十四万四千六百三十四个妇女参加纺织（占全区妇女劳动力百分之七十四），共织布七百六十万斤，供给了全区军民穿衣。从每县平均全年纺织妇女人数来看，一九四七年比四三年增加将近十倍。华北广大地区妇女都参加了纺织，很多地区已做到人人会纺，家家会织。华北全解放区已做到穿衣自给而有余。在纺织生产中涌现了无数的纺织模范。有不少妇女靠纺织买下了房子和地，靠着自己两只手，妇女们自己置下了家产，即以冀东玉田县某村二百多户人家来说，其中竟有十几户。如今到处说：“以前是谁有家小谁受累，如今是谁有媳妇不挨饿”。由于自己老婆纺织而渡过灾荒的人更感激地说：“若是没有妇女纺织，我们早就饿死了”。
    随着人民解放战争的开展，农村中青壮年大批地参军或支援前线，华北妇女在“男子前线打胜仗，妇女后方大生产”，“男子前线立战功，妇女后方立富功”的口号下，踊跃地参加了农业生产。土改以后，妇女的生产情绪更高涨，与男农民共同担负起恢复和发展解放区农业生产的重大任务。冀东区北宁路南，妇女参加农业劳动的竟达妇女劳动力的百分之九十。冀中深县一带地区妇女普遍的参加了农业劳动，成为最基本的主力，太岳、太行、察哈尔各地区一般的已达到百分之四十到五十。晋冀鲁豫四七年妇女儿童担负了全区农业生产中劳动力的百分之三十到四十，完成生产任务，支援了战争。很多妇女在农业生产中学会了“全把式”，在劳动中出现了许多劳动英雄模范。今年春天冀东区召开的男女劳模大会上选出了九个劳动模范，其中有六个是妇女。出席这次大会的冀东代表赵惠兰是十三分区两年连续当选的甲等生产模范，她自己种着二十九亩地，靠纺织解决全家四口穿衣问题。在她的影响下，附近有二千妇女学会了“全把式”，“孩子娘们顶大事”，许多人改变了轻视妇女的封建观点。
    随着妇女经济地位的提高，妇女的社会知识和管理社会的能力也随着提高了；在家里能当家作主，在婚姻上能自己作主，在村子里能掌政办公，不仅如此，农村的妇女干部散布在区、县、专署各种工作岗位，据太行、太岳、冀东三个地区妇女干部的统计：一千一百四十八人中，农村妇女出身的干部占八百零五人，仅冀东一个地区二百三十多个区，去年提拔起的新妇女干部就有五六百人。还有着不少数目的知识妇女，由于她们长期地深入工农群众，和劳动人民在一起，为他们服务，受到了锻炼，因而改造了自己，使自己逐渐走向工农化，从思想深处获得自己的彻底解放。华北妇女代表团中占半数以上的代表就是这种知识妇女与劳动人民结合的优秀典型。
    由于解放军的伟大胜利，华北又先后解放了石家庄、北平、天津、保定等大城市，特别象平、津、保等地，虽然是新解放的，但很快的就在女工及城市劳动妇女中，积极地工作，对于当前的生产建设及支援前线，都有了不小的贡献，同时这也是今后华北妇女工作的中心点，即如何使新解放的大城市与老解放区的广大农村的妇女工作结合起来，共同向前迈进。
