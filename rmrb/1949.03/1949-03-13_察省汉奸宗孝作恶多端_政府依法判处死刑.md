[Zhangjiakou Dispatch] Zong Xiao, the traitorous bandit leader of Chahar Province, who was deeply hated by the people, has been tried and sentenced to death by the Chahar Provincial People's Higher Court. With the approval of the North China People's Government, he was executed by firing squad on March 6th in accordance with the law. The criminal was 51 years old, of hooligan origin, and a native of Nuanquan Town, Yu County. After the "July 7th" Incident in 1937, the criminal surrendered to the Japanese invaders and successively served as the head of the puppet self-defense corps and the guard captain. After the Japanese surrender and the liberation of Chahar Province, the criminal escaped the law and transformed himself into a henchman of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. He successively served as the captain of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police, the commander of the suppression团 and the puppet county magistrate of Yu County. He was stationed in the Shenjing Huashaoying area of Yu County, engaging in burning, killing, raping, and looting, stopping at nothing. Over the past ten years, he has murdered more than 110 revolutionary cadres and people, including: the section chief of the Chahar South Sub-district People's Armed Forces Department, the secretary of the CCP Yu County Urban Committee, the director of the County Farmers' Association, district chiefs, directors of district farmers' associations, and village-level cadres, totaling 25 people. Family members of cadres, honorary soldiers, innocent people, and merchants traveling to and from the area totaled more than 80 people. The victims were subjected to eye gouging, tongue cutting, or being broken at the waist and dismembered. He was extremely vicious and cruel. After our army liberated Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua this time, the criminal was captured. However, the criminal remained unrepentant and twice escaped by jumping over the wall and jumping off the vehicle, attempting to continue his evil deeds. Fortunately, he was recaptured by us. Because the criminal's crimes were heinous and unforgivable, on the 6th of this month, the criminal was escorted to the execution ground and executed by firing squad. The people were greatly pleased.

　　察省汉奸宗孝作恶多端
  　政府依法判处死刑
    【张垣电】察省人民恨之入骨的汉奸匪首宗孝，已经察哈尔省人民高等法院审理判决死刑，并经华北人民政府批准，于三月六日依法执行枪决。该犯现年五十一岁，流氓出身，蔚县暖泉镇人。一九三七年“七七”事变后，该犯投降日寇，先后充当伪自卫团长、警卫队长等职。日寇投降，察省解放后，该犯竟逃脱法网，摇身一变而为蒋匪爪牙。先后充当蒋匪警察大队长、清剿团长及蔚县伪县长等职。常驻蔚县深井化稍营一带，四出烧杀奸淫抢掠，无所不为。十余年来前后被他杀害的革命干部、群众共达一百一十余名，计有：察南分区人民武装部股长、中共蔚县城市委、县农会主任、区长、区农会主任、及村级干部等共二十五名。干部家属、荣誉军人及无辜群众与来往商民共八十余名。被害者有被挖眼割舌或被腰折肢解，穷凶恶极，惨绝人寰。此次我军解放张、宣后，遂将该犯捕获，但该犯怙恶不悛，又曾两次逾墙跳车逃跑，企图继续为害，幸又被我捕获。因该犯罪恶深重，不可宽恕。本月六日，将该犯押赴刑场，执行枪决。人心大快。
