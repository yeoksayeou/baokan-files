Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources: A mass rally of 30,000 people was held in Paris, the French capital, on March 2nd. Attendees cheered and shouted: If Soviet troops pursue aggressors to French territory, we will welcome the Soviet troops as liberators! A giant 15-foot statue of French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez was hung in the venue, along with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

Duclos, leader of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group, announced at the meeting that millions of workers support Thorez's recent statement denouncing the plan for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union. Garaudy, another leader of the French Communist Party and chief writer of L'Humanité, declared at the meeting that Chiang Kai-shek had received billions of dollars in aid to wage war against the people. However, final disaster has now befallen him. Garaudy warned: "War-mongers! Let this historical lesson be a warning to you!" French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez delivered a speech at the end, in which he strongly criticized the US government's aggressive policies, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Mediterranean Pact, and the Brussels Pact. Thorez forcefully declared that the French Communist Party will use rifles in a revolutionary manner to prevent the outbreak of a war of aggression against the Soviet Union.

　　多列士在巴黎反战大会上演说
    法共将用革命方式
  　阻止侵苏战争爆发
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报道：法京巴黎于三月二日举行三万人的大集会，到会者欢声雷动的高呼：假如苏军追击侵略者到达法国领土，我们将把苏军作为解放者而予以欢迎！会场上高悬法共总书记多列士十五英尺的巨像，并悬有马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的画像。
    法共议会党团领袖杜克洛在大会上宣布：数百万工人拥护多列士最近发表的斥责侵苏战争计划的声明。法共另一领袖、人道报主笔加善在大会上宣称，蒋介石曾经获得数十亿美元的援助，以进行反对人民的战争。但是，最后的灾难现在降到他的头上了。加善警告称：“战争贩子们！让这个历史教训给你们一个告诫吧！”法共总书记多列士最后发表演说，他猛烈抨击美国政府的侵略政策、抨击马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约、地中海公约和布鲁塞尔公约。多列士有力地声称，法共将以革命的方式使用步枪以阻止反苏侵略战争的爆发。
