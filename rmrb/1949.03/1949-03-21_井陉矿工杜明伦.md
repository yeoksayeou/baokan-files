Du Minglun, Miner of Jingxing
Wei Jin
During the dark rule of the Chiang bandits, the most brilliant page in the history of the Jingxing Coal Mine workers' struggle was the heroic deed of Du Minglun, the stoker of the locomotive, who preferred death to submission.

Du Minglun, this young and outstanding worker, in order to cooperate with the workers' "slowdown" struggle at the time, risked the strict surveillance of the road police and cleverly piled obstacles on the downhill sections of the railway tracks, causing trains to often overturn there because they could not stop in time. He also deliberately burned the fire poorly, reducing the speed of the train and delaying the time for the enemy to harass the liberated areas when the enemy took trains to harass them. However, the most enthusiastic thing Du Minglun did was to organize some workers with his comrades Han Fengshan, Zhang Liangui, and others to establish an intelligence network with the guerrillas active in the villages near the mine, providing many convenient conditions for the guerrillas to harass the mine and boosting the workers' confidence in victory. However, Du Minglun's unfortunate encounter happened on this matter.

On the evening of May 26, 1946, the enemy in the mine surrounded the guerrillas in Xiaozhao Village and found nothing, which made them very angry. The next day, the enemy searched for "Communist bandits" among the workers. Du Minglun was reported by Gao Ze, a running dog of the enemy, and was arrested by several secret agents at the old mine's Public Security Bureau that night. Zhang Xinghua, the person in charge of the Kuomintang Party Department, interrogated him personally. This cunning fellow, when he received Du Minglun's strong reply, "I have not been home these days (referring to his Xiaozhao Village), nor have I written home," suddenly smiled kindly:

"Your Eighth Route Army is lenient, and we are also lenient. To tell you the truth, what letter did you send to the Eighth Route Army yesterday?"

However, the enemy's soft rope could not trap Du Minglun, and he still said strongly:

"There is no such thing at all. Don't make wild accusations."

The judge was furious, slammed the table, and said, "You are not a good thing!" Then he took out a board and beat Du Minglun's hands fiercely, causing them to bleed. Du Minglun suffered torture for the first time, showing some discomfort. The cunning judge thought he had grasped Du Minglun's weakness and immediately explained kindly that the torture was a last resort, and as long as he could explain the matter clearly, he guaranteed there would be no problems. But could Du Minglun tell? He couldn't help but think of the hungry and cold life under the layers of exploitation by the big contractors and the second contractors, and the unreasonable oppression of the workers by these bandits on weekdays—for example, two people talking casually would be accused of "communicating with bandits," and fellow villagers talking to each other would also be accused of "communicating with bandits"—and he was extremely angry. He glared and shouted loudly:

"Don't know!"

Immediately, Du Minglun was stripped of his clothes by a group of executioners, pressed to the ground, and beaten unconscious with random sticks. However, Du Minglun still shouted in his coma:

"Don't...know...ah..."

"Such hard bones, this time we must subdue you!" The judge shouted, while taking out a red-hot iron pillar and branding it across Du Minglun's ear, across his back, and then pouring boiling water into his mouth, whereupon Du Minglun became unconscious and was dragged to the confinement room.

In the middle of the night, Du Minglun woke up and suddenly saw a dark figure flashing in at the door. Du Minglun thought he was going to be buried alive, but then he strained his eyes and recognized Zhang Gengshun—a good friend who used to work with him and was now a cook in the Public Security Bureau. This friend knew that Du Minglun had suffered a lot of torture, and he was determined to take good care of him, so he took advantage of the silence of the night and ran over quietly at the risk of danger. He asked softly how Du Minglun's body was, gave him food, gave him water, and asked him to rub raw eggs in his hands, saying that this would reduce hand pain. Finally, he said:

"Did you say anything today?"

"I didn't say anything."

"That's right! You can't say a word, those who confess are all dead."

The next day, the interrogation continued. In front of Du Minglun were many instruments of torture: branding irons, fire pillars, sticks, boards, bricks, ropes, boiling water... The judge said in a gloomy tone:

"These things (referring to the instruments of torture) are your opponents. Tell the truth quickly, what letter did you send to the Eighth Route Army; if you don't tell, you can only live to this day."

Du Minglun had long put life and death out of his mind, and simply ignored the enemy's tactics, and as usual, said strongly:

"Don't know!"

"Then, you often go home, who are the county magistrate and district chief?"

"Don't know!"

"Good boy!" The judge cursed angrily. Then Du Minglun sat on the "tiger bench", with seven bricks under his feet and seven bricks hanging from his toes. When the judge shouted "Add more", Du Minglun had already fainted and didn't know how many bricks had been added.

The interrogation never yielded any results. The mine police chief, the Kuomintang Party Department instructor, and others ran to the workshop to interrogate Du Minglun's old mother, saying:

"How many times has your son been home?"

"Don't know."

"What letter did your son send to the Eighth Route Army?"

"Don't know."

"If you don't tell, your son will have to die."

"There's no way if he dies."

"If he dies, you won't survive either. You all have Eighth Route brains."

"If we can't survive, then we can't survive!"

The old mother's tenacity turned back the enemy's interrogation.

The enemy had no choice but to send Du Minglun to the puppet county government for processing.

Du Minglun stayed in the puppet county government for eight months. His cousin spent some money to bail him out temporarily. At this time, the mine police chief and the Kuomintang Party Department instructor who had opposed Du Minglun were transferred away. In order to make a living, Du Minglun went to work at the Jingxing Mine again, as a tipper worker.

On the evening of April 15, 1947, Du Minglun was suddenly awakened by gunfire. He remembered that in the past few days, the People's Liberation Army had already captured Yanfeng, Shangxia'an and other places near the Jingxing Mine, and estimated that the People's Liberation Army must have entered now. He hurriedly got up to inquire, and it was indeed true. He excitedly ran to the People's Liberation Army's position, braving the hail of bullets. He told the People's Liberation Army that to capture the Jingxing Mine, it was best to attack the mine police station, the 20th workshop (headquarters) and the West Building first. The enemy's forces in these places were very sparse, and there were no ambushes ahead. The People's Liberation Army advanced rapidly and captured the Jingxing Mine in a few hours. Du Minglun also led the People's Liberation Army to search for the enemy's hidden supplies.

　　井陉矿工杜明伦
    维进
    井陉煤矿在蒋匪黑暗统治时期，矿工的斗争史里显示极其光辉灿烂的一页，要算火车头的烧火工人杜明伦的宁死不屈的英勇事迹。
    杜明伦，这位年青的优秀的工人，为了配合当时工人“磨洋工”的斗争，曾经冒着路警严密监视的危险，在铁轨下坡处，以巧妙的办法堆起障碍物来，使火车行驶到这里时，常常来不及停止便翻倒了。也曾经当敌人坐着火车出扰解放区的时候，故意把火烧的不好，降低行车速度，耽误敌人出扰的时间。但是，杜明伦干得最起劲的，就是和他的战友韩凤山、张连贵等组织部分工人与活跃于矿山附近村庄的游击队建立情报网，给游击队袭扰矿山的许多便利条件，提高工人斗争的胜利信心。可是，杜明伦不幸的遭遇就发生在这件事情上面了。
    一九四六年五月二十六日晚上，矿山的敌人包围附近小皂村的游击队扑了个空，很生气。第二天，敌人在工人里头找觅“通匪”分子。杜明伦在敌人的走狗高泽告发下，当晚被几个密探抓到老矿的公安局。国民党党部的负责人张兴华亲自审问。这个狡猾的家伙，当得到杜明伦崛强地回答：“这几天没有回家（指他的小皂村），也没有给家里写信”的时候，突然和霭地笑了：
    “你们八路宽大，我们也是宽大。说实话，昨天你给八路军捎的什么信？”
    但是，敌人的软绳子是套不住杜明伦的，他还是那样崛强地说道：
    “根本没有这回事情，不要乱扣帽子。”
    审判官火了，把棹子一拍，说：“你就不是好东西！”随即拿出板子狠狠地打着杜明伦的手，打的鲜血淋漓。杜明伦第一次受刑，稍为显出难受的样子。狡猾的审判官以为抓住杜明伦的弱点，立即又和霭地说明用刑是不得已，只要能够把事情说清楚，保证什么问题都没有。但是，杜明伦能说出来吗？不由他想起在大包工、二包工的层层剥削下过着饥寒交迫的生活，想起这般匪徒平日对工人的无理压迫——比如两人随便说话要以“通匪”论罪，同乡与同乡说话也要以“通匪”论罪——就愤恨极点。他瞪起眼睛高声叫道：
    “不知道！”
    立刻，杜明伦被一群刽子手脱开衣服，按倒地上，乱棍把他打的昏迷。但是，杜明伦在昏迷中依然叫着：
    “不……知道……呀……”
    “好硬的骨头，这回非制死你不可！”审判官一边吆喝，一边拿出烧红的火柱从杜明伦的耳朵背烙过去，从背上烙过去，又用开水从嘴里灌进去，于是杜明伦不省人事，被拖到禁闭室。
    夜半，杜明伦醒来，忽然看见门口闪进一个黑影。杜明伦以为要被拉去活埋，后来用劲睁开眼睛，认得是张更顺——曾经和他一块工作，现在在公安局当伙夫的好朋友。这位朋友知道杜明伦受了许多酷刑，他决心把他照顾好，便趁这夜阑人静，冒着危险悄悄跑来。他细声问杜明伦的身体怎么样？给他饭吃，给他水喝，给他生鸡蛋叫他放在手里搓，说这样就可以减轻手痛。最后他说：
    “你今天说了什么没有？”
    “什么都没有说。”
    “对！一句都不能说，招了的人都死掉了。”
    第二天，继续审问。在杜明伦的面前摆着许多刑具：烙铁、火柱、棍子、板子、砖头、绳子、开水……审判官带着阴森森的口气说道：
    “这些东西（指刑具）就是你的对手，快说实话，你给八路军送的什么信；不说，就只能活到今天。”
    杜明伦早把生死置之度外，根本不理敌人这一套，照例崛强地说道：
    “不知道！”
    “那吗，你经常回家，县长、区长是谁？”
    “不知道！”
    “好小子！”审判官愤愤地骂着。接着杜明伦坐了“老虎凳”，两只脚垫了七个砖头，脚趾挂了七个砖头。当审判官喊“再垫”的时候，杜明伦已经昏迷，不知垫了几个砖头了。
    审问始终没有结果。矿警所长、国民党党部指导员等跑到工房审问杜明伦的老娘说：
    “你的儿子回过几次家？”
    “不知道。”
    “你的儿子给八路送的什么信？”
    “不知道。”
    “不说就只有让你儿子死。”
    “死也没有办法。”
    “他死了你们也活不成，你们都是八路脑筋。”
    “活不成就活不成吧！”
    老娘的顽强不屈，把敌人的审问顶了回去。
    敌人没有办法，把杜明伦送给伪县政府处理。
    杜明伦在伪县政府住了八个月。他的表兄花了点钱把他暂时保出来。这时，曾经和杜明伦作对的矿警所长、国民党党部指导员等都调走了，杜明伦为了生活，又到井陉矿工作，当翻车工人。
    一九四七年四月十五日晚上，杜明伦忽然被枪声惊酲。他想起这几天解放军已经攻占井陉矿附近的岩峰、上下安等地，估计现在必然是解放军打进来了。他急忙爬起打听，果然不错。他兴奋的冒着枪林弹雨，跑到解放军的阵地。告诉解放军要攻下井陉矿，最好先打矿警所、二十号工房（指挥部）及西大楼，这些地方敌人兵力很稀松，前头没有埋伏。解放军迅速地前进，几个钟头便拿下井陉矿。杜明伦又带领解放军找觅敌人埋藏的物资。
