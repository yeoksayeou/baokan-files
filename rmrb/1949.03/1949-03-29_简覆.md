Brief Replies

　　Mr. Zhi Lan:
    Regarding your question about the cessation of small-scale mining in the Jingxing Mining area, we have now received a reply from the Enterprise Department stating that they have directly responded to you, and you should receive it soon.
    Mr. Chun Nong and Mr. Liu Zhongtan: Your land is in the countryside, and you are asking how to handle it. The details provided in your letter are insufficient. We hope that after seeing this notice, you will inform us of the following: Who is cultivating the land, and what is your primary source of livelihood? Is it industry, commerce, or land, etc.?
    Mr. Yu Fu, Yan Jie, Run Shen, Qing Chao, Shu Xian, Ying Xian, Xiao Quan, Gong Li, Han Jie, Guan Zhong, Fan Su, Yao Bin, Zi Wu, Huan Tao: Regarding your inquiries about general health knowledge and disease treatment, we have forwarded them to the Health Department of the North China People's Government for their response. We will inform you after we receive their reply.
    Mr. Zhang Kui: Regarding your class status issue, we have forwarded your original letter to the Wenshui County Committee and suggested that they reclassify you according to the correct class delineation standards. If it is found to be accurate, it should be handled appropriately.
    Mr. Wang Cuiyi, Li Tianwei, Kang Lanqin, Bo Ying: Regarding your inquiries about emotional deterioration, the inability to continue living together, whether divorce is possible, and how to complete the procedures, we have successively answered them in the "Questions and Answers" section of this newspaper in March. If the situation you described is true, either party can file for divorce, and it will be approved. You can go to the local government to complete the divorce procedures (e.g., the Municipal People's Court) and obtain a formal judgment.
    Mr. Hao, Mr. Dong: You two have raised the issue of arranged marriages by your parents without your consent and wish to terminate the engagement. This is permissible, as long as you go through the procedures at the local government.
