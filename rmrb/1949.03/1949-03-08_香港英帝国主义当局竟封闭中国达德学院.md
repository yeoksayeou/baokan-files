Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. The British authorities in Hong Kong ordered the closure of Datong College, sponsored by Chinese democrats, in late last month. The college has been in existence for more than two years and has more than 400 students. The Hong Kong British authorities' excuse for closing the college was that it was "established for political purposes and endangers the order of Hong Kong and other regions." Prior to this, the Hong Kong Legislative Council had passed a "legislation" granting the Governor of Hong Kong "emergency powers" to deport so-called foreigners "unfit to reside in Hong Kong" and to ban schools and teachers whose teaching methods are "deemed harmful to Hong Kong and the British Commonwealth."

　　香港英帝国主义当局竟封闭中国达德学院
    【新华社陕北六日电】香港英国当局于上月下旬下令将中国民主人士主办的达德学院封闭。该学院已有两年多历史，学生有四百余人。香港英国当局封闭该学院的借口是说该学院“系为政治目的而设，妨害香港及其他区域之秩序。”在此以前，香港立法会议曾通过一项“立法”，授予香港总督以放逐所谓“不宜于居住香港”的外侨，及取缔所谓其教学法“被认为是有害于香港及大英联邦”的学校及教员的“紧急权利”。
