The Propaganda Department of the CCP Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee has summarized the following experiences regarding the insistence on learning by the county committees of various counties:

First, the county committee must first learn well in order to lead others in learning. Experience over the past two months has proven that wherever the county (or city) committee has learned diligently, there has been significant improvement and progress in the work. At the same time, whether the county committee can learn well is the key to whether the learning of cadres throughout the county can be carried out. For example, in Jiyuan, learning wasn't adequate before. Although it repeatedly urged district cadres to study, it sometimes fell short. This time, the county committee promoted the learning of district cadres with its own understanding and self-examination, and the effect was good. One of the experiences in learning leadership in Yuanqu is also that the leadership must first understand the central message of the document, preferably learning it earlier than other comrades. This is convenient for carrying out ideological leadership and answering difficult questions. Conversely, wherever the county committee's learning is poor, the learning system for general cadres often cannot be maintained, and the gains are not significant.

Second, whether the county committee can learn well is primarily determined by its attitude towards learning. This is first manifested in the relationship between work and learning. Some squeeze out time for learning despite being busy with work, while others relax their learning for fear of affecting work. This shows that they do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of learning, so the learning system cannot be maintained. For example, Meng County, Jincheng, and Gaoping did not plan their learning well in December because of meetings, and they did not squeeze out time for discussion, so their work could not be improved quickly. Treating learning as a work task is the correct attitude. The experience in Jiyuan recognizes that if you don't learn well, you can't do your work well. In the past, the county treated the symptom but not the cause, spending time on constant error correction. Now it is different. Not only is learning insisted on in the offices, but learning is also combined with scattered district cadres when going to the countryside to guide work, improving the cadres' awareness and work ability. Secondly, learning should be in-depth, and understanding should be improved. For example, in the learning of establishing a system of requests for instructions and reports, some are eager to check some superficial phenomena, eager to establish a system, and act hastily and blindly. Without in-depth study, the understanding is not improved, the ideological awareness is not sufficient, and the methods for improving work often become a mere formality.

Third, improve learning methods and overcome the contradiction between work and learning time. County committees often go up and down, and it is very important to organize the scattered and concentrated learning time of cadres; otherwise, learning will be relaxed. The experience of various counties is the same. Therefore, it is very important for the leadership to overcome the tendency to take over everything and the tendency of focusing on routine matters, and to arrange work and learning time well. The general method is: "Strengthen self-study at ordinary times, and focus on discussion during meetings." Seize the time to learn when work is first assigned and when work comes to an end. At each meeting, try to squeeze out time specifically for learning. In addition, personal reading should be the main focus, supplemented by group discussions (Meng County). The county committee's learning together with district cadres when going to the countryside can promote the learning of district cadres and also serve as a reminder to oneself. Jiyuan and Gaoping have done this, and the effect is very good. However, a unified learning content and progress should be prescribed in advance so that everyone is prepared when gathering for discussion.

Fourth, the county party secretary must take the lead in promoting. If the county party secretary does not pay attention to it, the effect will be poor if only the propaganda minister promotes it, because the county party secretary grasps the overall situation. If he does not put learning in an appropriately important position, learning will be squeezed out.

### 太岳四地委坚持学习经验

　　太岳四地委坚持学习经验
    中共太岳四地委宣传部关于各县县委坚持学习问题，总结经验如下：
    第一、县委首先要学好，才能领导别人学习。两月来经验证明：哪里县委（或市委）认真学了，哪里工作就有显著改进和提高。同时县委能否学好，是全县干部学习能否开展的关键。如济源，以前由于学习不够好，虽然对区干部学习一再催促，但有时仍不免落空。这次县委以自己的认识和检查，推动区干部学习，效果就好了。垣曲学习领导经验中也有一条是：领导上首先要了解文件中心，最好比其他同志早学，这样便于进行思想领导和解答疑难问题。反过来说，凡是县委学习差的地方，一般干部学习制度往往不能坚持，收获也就不大。
    第二、县委能否学好，首先决定于对学习的态度如何。这首先表现在对待工作和学习的关系上，有的虽工作忙仍然挤出学习时间，有的害怕影响工作而放松学习，这就说明对学习的重要性认识不够，因而学习制度就不能坚持。如孟县，晋城、高平在十二月份因开会都没很好计划学习，挤出时间进行讨论，这对工作就不能迅速提高。把学习当成个工作任务，这是正确的态度。如济源经验认识到：学习不好，工作也做不好。该县过去光头痛医头，脚痛医脚，把时间花费在不断的纠错，改错中。现在不同了，不但在机关坚持学习。下乡指导工作也结合分散的区干部进行学习，并提高了干部觉悟与工作能力。其次，学习要深入钻研，提高认识。如在建立请示报告制度的学习中，有的是急于检查一些表面现象，急于建立制度，草率和盲目，没有深入钻研，所以提高认识不够，思想自觉不够，改进工作订办法也往往流于形式。
    第三、改进学习方法，克服工作与学习时间的矛盾。县委经常上来下去，要把分散的和集中的干部学习时间组织好，这是一个很重要的问题；不然学习就会放松。各县经验都是如此。因此领导上要克服包办代替和事务主义，很好地安排工作学习时间是很要紧的。一般的方法是：“平时分散加强自修，开会时集中讨论”。工作刚一布置下去，和工作告一段落的时间，要抓紧进行学习。每次开会应尽量挤出时间，专门学习。另外，要以个人阅读为主，小组讨论为辅（孟县）。县委下乡和区干部一起学习，对区干部学习可起推动作用，对自己也是个督促。济源和高平都这样做了，效果很好。但事先要有计划地规定统一的学习内容及进度，以便集会讨论时大家有所准备。
    第四、县委书记要带头推动，县委书记如不重视，光是宣传部长一个人推动，作用就差，因为县委书记掌握全面，如不把学习放在适当重要位置，学习就会被挤掉了。
