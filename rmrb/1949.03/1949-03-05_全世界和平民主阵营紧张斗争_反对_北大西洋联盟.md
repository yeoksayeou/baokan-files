　　Recently, a tense struggle is taking place between the democratic camp of the world defending peace and the imperialist aggressive camp headed by the American reactionaries.

　　Negotiations for the "North Atlantic Treaty," the main tool of the US imperialist aggressive policy, are being stepped up in Washington and London. In Washington, the official talks between the representatives of the seven countries of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg began on February 25. After the talks, US Secretary of State Acheson said: "All clauses" of the draft North Atlantic Treaty "have been discussed." In London, the so-called "Western European Union Standing Committee," composed of representatives from Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, also held a full-day meeting on the 23rd to "consider the complete draft of the North Atlantic Treaty." On the 25th, Acheson announced that the US government’s legislation for "military assistance" to so-called "free countries" is "being considered together with the proposed North Atlantic Treaty"; the legislation for "military assistance" "will apply to countries outside the North Atlantic Treaty and countries that sign the North Atlantic Treaty." Prior to this, the US government appointed Eisenhower as Truman's military advisor and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Discussing Eisenhower’s appointment, Reuter’s commentator Simon pointed out that Eisenhower’s "most important task is to force Congress to agree to greatly increase military appropriations." TASS quoted the Washington Star as saying: "As soon as the North Atlantic Treaty is approved, Eisenhower will replace Montgomery as the military chief of the North Atlantic military group." On the eve of the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty, the US Navy held a "demonstration exercise" in the Caribbean. A total of one hundred and twenty US warships, hundreds of US aircraft, and 35,000 British and Canadian landing forces participated in the exercise. US and British newspapers declared that the US and British fleets would also conduct exercises in the Atlantic Ocean soon. Simultaneously with diplomatic negotiations and military exercises, the war agitator, US House Armed Services Committee Vice Chairman Scheffler, also issued the cry that "a contest of strength with the Soviet Union is inevitable sooner or later," and "sooner is better."

　　Although the American reactionaries and their lackeys are clamoring for war against the Soviet Union, and are indeed preparing for war, a great movement against war, against the "North Atlantic Alliance," and demanding stronger friendship with the Soviet Union is developing and growing within these countries. The progressive forces in these countries are full of victorious belief in defeating this new military adventure. In France, the members of parliament of the Communist Party, the largest party in the National Assembly, submitted a bill to the National Assembly on the 24th, requesting the government to declare its loyalty to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez issued a statement on the 22nd, warning the reactionaries that if France is finally driven to fight against the Soviet Union, the French working class and the French people will take the attitude that the working classes of Poland and other countries have taken, and stand on the side of the Soviet Union. In Italy, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti also warned the reactionaries in a response to reporters’ questions on the 26th that if Soviet troops pursue aggressors on Italian territory, then "the direct responsibility of the Italian people is to give the Soviet army the most effective assistance and give the aggressors the punishment they deserve." In Britain, representatives of 950,000 workers held an important gathering in Manchester. The meeting passed a declaration to strive for world peace, stating: "The people of the world do not want war—the people of Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States, and the people of any other country, do not want war. Strengthening British-Soviet relations and friendship can prevent war and concretely promote the cause of world peace." The meeting also passed a resolution requesting the British government to fully implement the Anglo-Soviet Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Treaty and refuse to sign the North Atlantic Treaty. Renowned Member of Parliament Mills declared at the meeting that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to oppose the Soviet Union. "We must kill this treaty before it kills us. The British people must do everything possible to prevent the British government from signing the North Atlantic Treaty." In the Netherlands, the Central Committee of the Communist Party passed a resolution calling on the Dutch nation to lodge a strong protest against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, against the new war instigators, and to strive for lasting peace. In Germany, a petition signed by more than five million women demanded that the United Nations ban the use of atomic weapons. The International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of Cultural Workers for Peace, the International Democratic Women's Federation, and world-renowned cultural, scientific, and artistic workers have also issued declarations, calling on the world public to pay attention to the increasing threats to international peace, and appealing to all democratic organizations and all peace advocates around the world to convene the World Congress of Peace Advocates in April this year. In the United States, Progressive Party leader Wallace opposed the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty when he testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on February 23. Wallace believes that the North Atlantic Treaty and the proposed Western European Arms Lending Act are "the most dangerous and far-reaching actions." "These measures will actually seriously endanger and weaken the security of the United States and will lead to the economic bankruptcy of Western Europe and the United States." Wallace emphasized: "The military adventures currently being planned are bound to fail because they are built on completely wrong estimates of the Soviet Union." Wallace once again called on the Truman administration to negotiate with the Soviet Union. The offices of US Senators and Representatives are filled with protest letters and telegrams against war preparations and high military budgets. These protests forced Democratic Senatorial Foreign Affairs Leader Connally and Republican Senatorial Foreign Affairs Leader Vandenberg to issue false statements against any clause in the North Atlantic Treaty that "contains the moral obligation to declare war" in the recent Senate foreign policy debate.

　　February 23 was the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces, the bastion of world peace. The working people of the entire Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world warmly celebrated this festival. The Soviet Armed Forces, which "tirelessly maintain a high state of combat readiness" (Bulganin), "are a serious obstacle to the new American and British ambitious plotters who vainly attempt to dominate the world" (New Times magazine). In the order for the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, Marshal Bulganin, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, pointed out: "Just as the US ruling group is frantically striving to establish world hegemony and pursuing a policy of aggression and launching new wars, the Soviet Union is victoriously implementing its plans for the development of the national economy, and resolutely fighting for lasting democratic peace throughout the world."

　　This year is the fourth year of the Soviet Union's first post-war five-year plan. In mid-February, the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party issued a decision on the preparation of collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state-owned farms for spring sowing. Now, collective farms throughout the Soviet Union are formulating their own production plans based on this decision. In dozens of regions in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and other Central Asian and Transcaucasian republics in southern Soviet Union, spring sowing is already underway. On the industrial front, a new patriotic movement of great significance has emerged. The movement to win the title of first-class product production work team initiated by Zhutkik, the deputy foreman of the Moscow Red Holm Textile Factory, has quickly spread throughout the country and has been enthusiastically responded to by textile factories and hundreds of other enterprises across the country. In the mining industry, the Soviet government has decided to hold a mechanized coal mining competition this year and has established bonuses for this competition. The elections of people's courts of all republics and states in the Soviet Union, which began four months ago, are now victoriously approaching their end.

　　The youths of the liberated socialist countries universally held rallies on Colonial Youth Solidarity Day (February 21), expressing their solidarity with the colonial youth. The Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee also wrote a letter on behalf of Soviet youth to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, announcing that Soviet youth are closely related to the youth of China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and other countries fighting for national liberation and freedom, and extended warm greetings to them, congratulating them on winning further victories in their struggles. On the eve of the first World Colonial Youth Solidarity Day, IUS President Grohman summarized the situation of Eastern youth's struggle against imperialist colonial enslavement. Grohman pointed out that the youth of Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, India, the Middle East, and other places are playing an active role in the struggles of the people of these countries for independence.

　　Other important international events in recent times are as follows:

　　(1) Bevelikas, one of the Greek Communist Party leaders and Secretary-General of the Greek General Confederation of Labor, was secretly executed by the Athens puppet government on February 20. This atrocity aroused the indignation and loud protests of the working people throughout Greece and the world. To commemorate this heroic son of the Greek working class, the Greek democratic government and the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party decided to expand the ranks of the Democratic Army and establish a new force named after Bevelikas.

　　(2) The Italian General Confederation of Labor Steering Committee passed a resolution on the 22nd authorizing the trade unions to "take all measures to promote a general increase in wages." On the 21st, public transport workers throughout Italy held a 24-hour general strike to protest the government's refusal to grant their wage increase demands.

　　(3) The Great Hural (Supreme People's Assembly) of the Mongolian People's Republic held its ninth session. The Small Hural, elected by the Great Hural, approved the new government of the Mongolian People's Republic headed by Marshal Choibalsan.

　　(4) The reactionary Nehru government launched a new large-scale arrest of communists and members of democratic organizations throughout India. As of the 24th, more than 1,600 communists had been arrested in various industrial centers.

### 全世界和平民主阵营紧张斗争  反对“北大西洋联盟”

　　全世界和平民主阵营紧张斗争
    反对“北大西洋联盟”
    最近，全世界保卫和平的民主阵营，和以美国反动派为首的帝国主义侵略阵营之间，正在进行着紧张的斗争。
    作为美帝国主义侵略政策主要工具的“北大西洋公约”的谈判，正在华盛顿和伦敦加紧进行。在华盛顿，美、加、英、法、荷、比、卢七国代表的正式会谈，已于二月二十五日开始，美国务卿艾奇逊在会谈以后说：北大西洋公约草案的“所有各款均曾予以讨论”。在伦敦，英、法、荷、比、卢五国代表组成的所谓“西欧联盟常务委员会”，亦于二十三日举行了整日的会议，“考虑了北大西洋公约的完全草案”。廿五日，艾奇逊宣布，美国政府对所谓“自由国家”的“军事援助”的立法，“刻正与建议中之北大西洋公约一起予以考虑中”；“军事援助”的立法，“将适用于北大西洋公约以外国家与北大西洋公约之签字国家”。在这以前，美国政府任命了艾森豪威尔为杜鲁门的军事顾问和参谋长联席会议的主席。电通社评论员西蒙在论及艾森豪威尔的任命时指出艾森豪威尔“所面临的最主要任务，是迫使国会同意大大地增加军事拨款”。塔斯社引华盛顿明星报的消息称：“一俟北大西洋公约得到批准，艾森豪威尔就将代替蒙哥马利任北大西洋军事集团的军事首长。”在北大西洋公约即将缔结的前夕，美国海军在加勒比海举行了“示威演习”。共有一百二十艘美国战舰、数百架美国飞机，及三万五千名英国、加拿大的登陆部队，参加了这次演习。美英报纸宣称，不久以后，美国和英国的舰队，还要在大西洋举行演习。与外交谈判和军事演习的同时，战争鼓动者、美国众院武装部队委员会副主席雪弗尔，也发出了“与苏联较量力量迟早不可避免”，“不如早些好”的叫嚣。
    虽然美国反动派和它的走卒们在叫嚣着要对苏战争，并且也确实地在进行着战争的准备，但是，在这些国家内，一个反对战争、反对“北大西洋联盟”和要求加强对苏友谊的大运动，正在发展和壮大。这些国家内的进步势力充满了击败这种新的军事冒险的胜利信念。在法国，国会第一大党——共产党的议员们，于二十四日向众院提出议案，要求政府宣布忠实于法苏互助协定。法共总书记多列士更于二十二日发表声明警告反动派称：若果法国最后被驱使对苏作战，则法国工人阶级和法国人民将采取波兰等国工人阶级所曾采取的态度，站在苏联方面。在意大利，意共总书记托格里亚蒂亦于二十六日在答记者问时警告反动派称：假定苏军在意大利领土之上追击侵略者，那么，“意大利人民的直接责任，就是予苏军以最有效的援助，予侵略者以应得的教训”。在英国，九十五万工人的代表在曼彻斯特举行重要集会，会议通过争取世界和平的宣言称：“全世界的人民不愿战争——不论是英国、苏联和美国，和其他任何国家的人民，都不愿战争。加强英苏关系与友谊，就可以防止战争，并能具体地推进世界和平的事业。”会议又通过决议案，要求英国政府全部履行英苏合作互助条约，并拒绝签订北大西洋公约。著名国会议员米尔斯在会上宣称，北大西洋公约的目的，在于反对苏联。“我们必须不等这个条约杀死我们就先杀死它。英国人民必须尽一切努力使英国政府不签订北大西洋公约。”在荷兰，共产党中央委员会通过决议，号召荷兰民族提出强烈抗议，反对签订北大西洋公约，反对新战争挑拨者，争取持久的和平。在德国，五百余万妇女签名的请愿书，要求联合国禁止使用原子武器。世界文化工作者保卫和平大会国际联络委员会、国际民主妇女联盟以及世界著名的文化、科学、艺术工作者亦发表宣言，号召世界公众注意日益增加的对国际和平的威胁，并向全世界一切民主组织与一切和平拥护者呼吁，在今年四月召开世界和平拥护者大会。在美国，进步党领袖华莱士于二月二十三日在众院外委会作证时，反对签订北大西洋公约。华莱士认为，北大西洋公约和西欧军火租借法的建议，是“最危险而遗患最深的行动”。“这种措施实际上会严重地危害和削弱美国的安全，并将导向西欧和美国的经济破产。”华莱士着重指出：“现在拟议中的军事冒险必定失败，因为它们是建筑在对于苏联的完全错误的估计之上。”华莱士再次要求杜鲁门政府与苏联进行谈判。在美国参众议员的办公室内，充斥着反对战争准备和高额军事预算的抗议信件和函电。这些抗议，曾迫使民主党参院外交领袖康纳利与共和党参院外交领袖范登堡，在最近参院的外交辩论中，不得不发出反对北大西洋公约中“包含宣战的道义义务”的任何条款的虚伪声明。
    二月二十三日，是世界和平的堡垒——苏联武装部队建军的三十一周年纪念。全苏联的劳动人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，在这一天均热烈地庆祝这一节日。“不倦地维持高度的战斗准备状态”（布尔加宁）的苏联武装部队，“对于新的妄图独霸世界的美英野心家是严重的障碍”（新时代杂志）。在苏联军队建军纪念日的命令中，苏联武装部队部部长布尔加宁元帅指出：“正当美国统治集团狂暴地力求建立世界霸权、奉行着进行侵略及发动新战争的政策的时候，苏联却在胜利地实现着发展国民经济的计划，坚决地为全世界持久的民主和平而奋斗。”
    今年是苏联战后第一个五年计划的第四年。二月中旬，苏联部长会议及联共中央颁发了一项关于集体农场、机器与拖拉机站及国营农场准备春季播种的决定。现在，全苏联的集体农场，都在根据这一决定订立自己的生产计划。在苏联南部的乌兹别克斯坦、土库曼、塔吉克斯坦及其他中亚细亚与外高加索共和国的几十个地区，春季播种工作已在进行中。在工业战线上，目前又出现了有重大意义的新的爱国运动。莫斯科红色霍尔姆纺织工厂副领班朱特基克发起的争取头等货品生产工作队的称号的运动，很快已传遍全国各地，并已得到全国各纺织厂及数百个其他企业的热烈响应。在矿业方面，苏联政府决定今年举行机械化采煤竞赛，并为这一竞赛设立了奖金。四个月以前开始的全苏各共和国及各州人民法庭的选举，目前正胜利地接近结束。
    解放了的社会主义国家的青年，在殖民地青年团结日（二月二十一日），普遍地举行集会，表示他们和殖民地青年的团结。苏联青年反法西斯委员会并代表苏联青年写信给世界民主青年联盟，宣布苏联青年与为民族解放和为自由而斗争的中国、印尼、越南、缅甸、马来亚等其他国家的青年休戚相关，并向他们致热烈的敬礼，祝贺他们在斗争里赢得进一步的胜利。在第一个世界殖民地青年团结日的前夕，国际学联主席格罗曼曾综述东方青年反对帝国主义殖民地奴役斗争的情形。格罗曼指出：越南、马来亚、缅甸、印度、中东等地的青年，在各该国人民争取独立的斗争中，都起着积极作用。
    最近时期中国际上之其他重要事件如下：
    （一）希共领袖之一、希腊劳工总同盟总书记贝贝利加斯，于二月二十日被雅典傀儡政府秘密处死。这一暴行激起了全希腊和全世界各地劳动人民的义愤和大声抗议。为了纪念这位希腊工人阶级英勇的儿子，希腊民主政府与希共中央决定扩大民主军的队伍，并成立以贝贝利加斯命名的新部队。
    （二）意大利总工会指导委员会于二十二日通过决议，授权各工会“采取一切方法促进普遍增加工资。”二十一日，全意公共交通工人举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议政府拒绝他们的增资要求。
    （三）蒙古人民共和国大呼拉尔（最高人民议会）举行了第九届会议。由大呼拉尔选出的小呼拉尔，批准了以却伊巴桑元帅为首的蒙古人民共和国新政府。
    （四）反动的尼赫鲁政府，在印度各地对共产党人及民主团体的成员劳动了新的大规模的逮捕。截至二十四日为止，各工业中心被捕的共产党人已达一千六百人以上。
