700,000 Jin of "Si" Cotton Seeds
To be Transported to Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Handan

[Reported by this newspaper] The Beiping Branch of the Cotton Improvement Bureau, under the Agriculture and Water Conservancy Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission's Materials Acquisition Committee, has a considerable stock of "Si" cotton seeds. In order to ensure that this variety reaches the rural areas in a timely manner, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government is currently planning to transport 300,000 jin to Shijiazhuang, 300,000 jin to Baoding, and 100,000 jin to Handan. Every 100,000 jin can be sown on 10,000 mu of cotton fields. Each mu of this "Si" cotton yields 250 jin of seed cotton, which is one and a half times more than local cotton varieties, and can be spun into 42-count yarn. This year, the plan is to promote it on 200,000 mu throughout the region. Next year, it can reach 1.5 million mu, and in the third year, it can reach 10 million mu, guaranteeing that all yarn factories in the North China region will have more than enough "Si" cotton.
