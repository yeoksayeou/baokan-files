　　【Another News Item】Workers at the Beiping Tram Company Repair Shop overcame the serious problem of material shortages. In the month after liberation, in addition to repairing the vehicles that were regularly damaged every day, they also repaired 40 broken-down vehicles. Day and night shifts of workers did not rest for a moment after starting work. Moreover, they inspected every vehicle leaving the factory at night to repair any problems immediately. Workers in groups of ten frequently studied and improved techniques to overcome material difficulties. A large gear with eighty-three teeth had worn thin and could no longer be used, but Wang Naiquan, a welding foreman with sixteen years of experience, used electric welding to repair the gear teeth, replacing cast steel large gears (two can be welded and repaired in three days). The one hundred and thirty-seven copper heads on the roller core were previously made entirely by foreign machines, but now the repair shop workers can make them piece by piece by hand. When they are busy, the workers even stay late to get the job done. Mica magnetic coil insulation boards were unavailable, so the workers invented a method of using asbestos paper and insulating varnish, pressed into shape, to replace them. Worker Guo Qishan invented insulation boards made by hand-grinding bluestone to replace the original insulation boards. Li Desheng invented a spring made of ordinary iron, which works just as well. Cut-off axles had originally become waste, but the workers used them to modify small gears and motor shafts, ensuring that no materials were wasted.

　　发扬创造智慧
  　克服材料困难
    【又讯】北平电车公司修造厂工人克服了材料困难的严重问题，在解放后的一个月内，除去修理每天经常损坏的车辆外，又修好了坏车四十辆，昼夜两班工人，上班后一会儿也不休息，而且在夜间把每一辆出厂的车子都检查一遍，有毛病随时修理。工人们每十个人为一个小组经常研究改进技术，克服材料困难。八十三个齿的大牙轮磨薄了，本已不能再用，但有十六年经验的一个电焊领班工人王乃全，用电焊补起齿轮，代替铸钢的大牙轮（三天可以焊补两个），滚子心上一百三十七片的铜头，过去完全是用外国机器造的，现修造厂的工人可以用手工一片片的制造出来。忙的时候，工人们并且晚下班赶做。用云母制的磁圈隔电板，没有来源，工人发明了用石绵纸和绝缘漆配合起来压成型来代替。工人郭岐山发明用青石板手工磨成的隔电板代替隔电板，李德胜发明用普通铁打造的弹簧，也一样能用。切断了的车轴本来已成废物，但工人们用它改造小牙轮和马达轴，不让物资有一点浪费。
