　　Experience in Eliminating Remaining Enemies in Xiuwu
    Xiuwu gained the following experience in the work of eliminating remaining enemies:
    　　　　Searching for enemy and puppet personnel and weapons by mobilizing the masses
    In the initial stage of the movement, there was a tendency to simply focus on weapons and target individuals. This phenomenon occurred in the Fourth District. Upon arriving in a village and seeing someone, they would immediately ask, "Do you have a gun?" In the Chengguan area of the First District, when approaching the masses, they would ask about guns after only a few words. After the leadership emphasized mobilizing the masses, they became too immersed in the masses, causing some suspicion among them. In areas where policies were correctly implemented, they relied on activists to mobilize the masses to voice their grievances, discover remaining bandits and weapons, and constantly monitor and report the actions of remaining bandits. For example, after being questioned by the masses, Zhao Fashun in Xicun, Fourth District, obediently surrendered three rifles and four pistols. This launched a mass-based public security movement.
    　　　　Conditionally retaining and using puppet Baojia personnel
    Enemy and puppet personnel should be treated differently according to their situation. Puppet Baojia personnel must be conditionally retained and used based on individual assessment. Those who have committed heinous crimes must be punished from the outset. In the First District, after punishing Qin Huaizhong, the Baozhang who continued illegal activities, extensive publicity was conducted, which influenced the former office staff in Beimen to make self-criticisms and formulate covenants and plans. In Jingli Village, Second District, the Baozhang, after criticism and education, actively promoted registration and unearthed three rifles. Those who had not committed major crimes underwent training. They were deeply moved upon hearing about the lenient policy and voluntarily formulated plans to atone for their crimes. For lower-level personnel, class education and grievance-airing methods were adopted. Chen Zhouliu of the Sixth District, after airing his grievances, realized that the Communist Party was truly for the people and that the Kuomintang had harmed him. After crying bitterly, he resolutely handed over two large guns he was hiding for others.
    　　　　Vigorously publicizing and organizing farmers' associations, preventing blind action by the masses in a timely manner
    Organizing the masses is the foundation for carrying out the movement, and propaganda work is the key to organizing the masses. Propaganda should be implemented throughout the entire movement and in every occasion. However, attention must be paid to ensuring that the organizational form develops in accordance with the level of awareness of the masses. Xiuwu experienced two large-scale propaganda movements: the first was in early December of last year, when the victory news of our army's autumn offensive and the victory in Xuzhou were vigorously publicized, and secret organizational work was carried out. In one month, 1,168 farmer association members were developed, laying the foundation for the work. The second was in mid-January, when the news of the liberation of Pingjin was publicized, promoting the development of the farmer association work. The farmers' association was then made public and quickly grew to 2,532 members. The awareness of the masses was also increasing day by day. At first, they were suspicious of the rumors spread by special agents, then they stopped believing them, and finally they exposed them face-to-face or even took them to the farmers' association for questioning.
    When the farmers' association is made public, there will inevitably be a large number of people preparing to join. Xiuwu's approach is: welcome upright working people to participate; landlords, rich peasants, and hooligans are not allowed; those with blemishes must clean up their act. This further ensures the purity of the mass ranks, and political power and armed forces are also established on this basis.
    Because the masses have begun to be mobilized and their hatred for the enemy, puppets, and remaining bandits is bone-deep, it is necessary to conduct policy education at this time to prevent blind action. Chengguan has a good grasp of this link, guiding the anger of the masses towards calculating strength and calming down, leading production, combining review, and consolidating and expanding their own organization. They also guided the militia to review and criticize their undesirable work styles.
    　　　　Must be combined with production
    The new area of Xiuwu was devastated by Chiang bandits, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. After liberation, the broad masses urgently demanded production. Therefore, if the movement to eliminate the remaining bandits cannot be combined with production, it will inevitably lead to the bad result of being divorced from the masses. According to a survey of 72 activists in Chengguan, 59 urgently demanded production; in Chengguan alone, 438 households with 1,460 people had nothing to eat. After the leadership vigorously organized production, two-thirds of the masses solved their livelihood difficulties within a month, and as a result, the enthusiasm of the masses for the work of eliminating the remaining enemies was further enhanced.

　　修武肃清残敌经验
    修武在肃清残敌工作中，获得如下经验：
    　　　　通过发动群众搜查敌伪人枪
    运动初期，曾发生了单纯搞枪，在个别人身上打圈子的偏向。四区曾有过这种现象，一到村，一见人，就问“有枪没有”？一区城关也一度在接近群众时，谈不上两句便问枪的事。经领导上强调发动群众后，又一头钻在群众里面，引起某些群众的疑惧。在执行政策正确的地区是依靠积极分子，发动群众诉苦，从中发现残匪和枪支，并随时监视，报告残匪行动。如四区西村赵法顺受到群众质问后，便顺从地交出三支步枪、四支决枪。这样便展开了群众性的治安运动。
    　　　　伪保甲人员　有条件地分别留用
    对敌伪人员应分别对象，不同对待，对伪保甲人员，必须是有条件的分别留用，对罪大恶极的分子，一开始就须予以惩处。在一区，惩办了继续非法活动的保长秦怀忠等以后，做了广泛的宣传，因之影响到北门旧办公人员做了检讨，并订出了公约和计划。二区京里村保长经批评、教育转变后，积极推动登记，搞出了三支步枪。一般无大罪行者，都经过训练，他们听到宽大政策，很受感动，自动订出了赎罪计划。对下层人员，则采取了阶级教育、启发诉苦的方式。六区周流老陈，经过诉苦后，认识到共产党是真正为了人民，国民党害了他，大哭过后，毅然交出了为他人藏的两支大枪。
    　　　　大力宣传组织农会　适时防止群众盲动
    组织群众是开展运动的基础，而宣传工作又是组织群众的关键，宣传应贯彻到整个运动中，贯彻到每个场合中。但必须注意组织形式要随群众的觉悟程度而发展。修武经过两次大规模的宣传运动：第一次是在去年十二月初，大力宣传了我军秋季攻势和徐州的胜利消息后，开展了秘密的组织工作，一个月的时间发展了农会会员一千一百六十八人，奠定了工作基础。第二次是在一月中旬，宣传了平津解放消息，推动了农会工作的开展。于是公开了农会，很快地便发展到会员二千五百三十二人。群众的觉悟程度也是日益提高了，开始时对特务分子所造谣言抱狐疑态度，进而不相信，最后便当面揭穿甚至带到农会去质问。
    在公开农会时，必然还会有大批人准备拥入，修武的办法是：欢迎正派的劳动人民参加；地主、富农、流氓分子都不要，有黑点的要洗脸擦黑。这样更保证了群众队伍的纯洁，政权和武装也在这个基础上建立起来了。
    正由于群众已开始发动起来，对敌伪残匪仇恨入骨，故这时必须进行政策教育，防止盲目行动。城关很好的掌握了这一环节，把群众的激愤引向计算力量而冷静下来，领导生产，结合审查并巩固扩大自己的组织。还诱导民兵对不良作风作了检讨和批判。
    　　　　必须结合生产
    修武新区惨遭蒋匪摧残，人民生活极苦，解放后，广大群众都迫切要求生产。所以在肃清残匪运动中如不能与生产相结合，势必造成脱离群众的恶果。据城关七十二个积极分子的调查，就有五十九人迫切要求生产；仅城关就有四百三十八户一千四百六十人没吃的，经领导上大力组织生产后，一个月中三分之二的群众解决了生活困难，因之，群众对肃残工作的热情更加提高了。
