Guo Mengnu, a rural working woman who has been liberated from feudal oppression, has been elected as a representative from Southern Hebei to attend the National Women's Congress. The working women in many villages in Southern Hebei were very happy to hear this news.

When the reporter went to interview this female representative from a working-class background, she was talking to a young woman about her tragic childhood under feudal oppression. She said, "When I was nine years old, my mother had a younger brother. Because my mother didn't have enough to eat and didn't have much milk, my brother was so hungry that he was just skin and bones before he was even a month old. My father gritted his teeth and pawned the few acres of land left by our ancestors. The money from pawning the land was gone before my mother was even a month postpartum. There was still nothing to eat at home. My father looked at my mother and cried, my mother held my little brother and cried, and my brother opened his little mouth, hoarsely crying without making a sound. I was like a fool, looking at my father and then at my mother, shaking my brother, feeling scared, not knowing what was going to happen. As it was getting dark, an old woman picked up my brother and left. I cried and pulled him back, but my mother hugged me and said, 'Let him escape to live, we can't afford to raise him!' But my mother's tears fell on my face like raindrops." Speaking of this, Mengnu pursed her lips tightly, suppressing her grief, and then continued: "The next morning, my mother got up early, washed my face, and combed my hair, saying that she would take me to visit relatives. When we got to the North Gate, she sent me to a stranger's house, and soon my mother disappeared. From then on, I became a child bride.

My husband's family had many people and little land, and life was not easy. My mother-in-law told me to spin cotton, but I couldn't spin well, or I would doze off while spinning at night. When my mother-in-law saw me, she would either beat me or scold me. I had to cook two meals a day. Sometimes the steamed buns were raw, and the whole family would scold me. Sometimes I added too much firewood, and the soup would dry up, and I would get beaten again. Alas! There are endless hardships!" She then talked about the present, and a smile gradually appeared on her face: "I never dreamed that I would have today. If it weren't for the Communist Party, women would never be liberated! After the establishment of the democratic government, I joined the Women's Rescue Association. Because of this, my mother-in-law wanted to beat me, and we finally separated. At that time, I was only given one mu and four fen of land, and I suffered from a lack of food and clothing, spinning thread and doing odd jobs all day long. When the mass movement started, I was allocated more than four mu of land. The wheat, millet, sorghum, and cotton I cultivated in the first year were all available, and I still have some in storage now. I bought a piglet last year, and also bought a small donkey to open a mill. I grind three dou of wheat every day, which can earn six jin of flour and more than ten jin of bran."

Guo Mengnu not only produces well herself, but also enthusiastically helps everyone else to produce. Last year, during the drought prevention, she mobilized 50% of the women in the village to water the land, and they watered 24 mu in three days. After winter, she organized a women's weaving group. When digging cellars, she carried wood, moved firewood, carried earth, and hammered the top, so everyone's enthusiasm for production was also very high. Because she helps others solve difficulties and leads everyone in production, she has been elected as the director of the Women's Federation three times since the liberation of Baixiang. Now she has been elected as a representative to the National Women's Congress.

When the reporter casually asked about her married life, she blushed and said, "He used to beat me and scold me, and he didn't come to my room for the first two years after the separation. Now it's different. When I'm busy, he helps me fetch water and do chores. My mother-in-law has also changed. She often cares for me and tells me to go drink water and soup. This time, when the county elected me as a representative, the whole family made dumplings to send me off, and they even kept my child there. The whole family looked at each other affectionately!" Mengnu drew a very valuable experience from her past labor history. She said very seriously: "If women want to turn over, they can only participate in production!" At this time, the young woman's eyes were respectfully focused on the red representative card on her chest.

　　翻身了的郭梦女
  　冀南出席全国妇代会代表之一
    从封建压迫中解放了的农村劳动妇女郭梦女，当选了冀南出席全国妇女代表大会的代表，冀南许多村庄的劳动妇女们，听到这个消息，都感到十分欢欣。
    当记者去访问这位劳动出身的妇女代表时，她正在和一位姑娘谈她在封建压迫下悲惨的童年，她说：“我九岁那年，俺娘添了一个小兄弟，因为娘没吃的也没有什么奶，还不到满月哩，弟弟就饿得皮包着骨头不成个样了。俺爹咬着牙，把祖辈留下的几分地当出去，当了地的钱还没吃到俺娘满月就完了，家里还是没啥吃，爹看着娘流泪，娘抱着小兄弟哭，俺兄弟小嘴一张一张的哑着嗓子哭不出声来。我象傻子一样，看看爹又看看娘，摇晃着弟弟，心里害怕，不知道要出什么事。天快黑的时候，一位老妈妈抱上我的兄弟走了，我哭着往回拉，俺娘搂住我说：‘让他逃活命去吧，咱养不活他！’可是俺娘的眼泪象雨点样打在我的脸上。”说到这里，梦女用力地抿住嘴，抑制着自己的悲痛，接着又说：“第二天俺娘一早就起来了，给我洗脸、梳头，说是带我去串亲戚，到了北关，把我送到一个生人的家里，不一会母亲就不见了。从此我就当了童养媳。
    婆家人多地少，日子也不好过，婆婆叫我纺花，我纺不好，或是夜里纺的时候打瞌睡了，婆婆看见不是打就是骂。一天做两顿饭，有时蒸的窝窝生了，一家子骂，有时多添一把火，汤又烧干了，又得挨打。唉！那难处说不尽有多少！”她接着谈到了现在，脸上也逐渐露出了笑容：“梦也梦不到有今天，要不是来了共产党，妇女们万辈子也不能解放！从民主政府成立后，我就参加了妇救会，为这婆婆要打我，最后我们分了居。那时只给了我一亩四分地，少吃没穿的熬煎着，一天不闲的纺卖线子，做零活。群众运动起来了，我分了四亩多地，头年耕的麦子、谷子、高粱、棉花啥也有，吃到现在还有存的。头年买了个小猪，还买了一头小毛驴开磨坊，每天磨三斗麦子，能赚六斤面十多斤麸子。”
    郭梦女不但自己生产的好，还热心的帮助大家生产。去年防旱时，她动员了全村百分之五十的妇女去浇地，三晌浇了二十四亩。入冬后，组织了一个妇女纺织组，挖窨子时，她扛木料、搬柴火、背土、打顶子，因此大家生产情绪也十分高涨。由于她帮助别人解决困难领导大家生产，柏乡解放后，三次被选为妇会主任。现在当选为出席全国妇代会的代表了。
    当记者顺便问到她的夫妇生活时，她红着脸说：“从前打我骂我，分家的头两年不上我这屋来。现在不同了，我忙的时候，他也替我挑水做活。婆婆也变了，她时常关照我，叫我去喝水喝汤。这次县里选上我当代表，全家包饺子送我，把俺孩也拦过去了，一家人看着都怪亲热的！”梦女从过去劳动的历史中，得出一个极宝贵的经验，她很认真地说：“妇女要翻身，只有参加生产！”这时，那位姑娘的两眼，尊敬的注射在她胸前的红色代表证上。
