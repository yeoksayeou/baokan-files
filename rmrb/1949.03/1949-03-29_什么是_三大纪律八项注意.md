To the Editor:

    Although I know a little about the "Three Main Rules of Discipline" and "Eight Points for Attention" promulgated by the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, I am not very clear. I would like to ask the editor to answer this for me.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Wang Yaoting

Mr. Wang Yaoting:

    The specific contents of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline" and "Eight Points for Attention" are:

    Three Main Rules of Discipline: (1) Obey orders in all your actions; (2) Don't take a single needle or thread from the masses; (3) Turn in everything captured to public ownership and absolutely abide by the rules of the battlefield.

    Eight Points for Attention: (1) Speak politely and make propaganda and explanation work more important; (2) Be fair in buying and selling, and never be domineering in public buying and selling; (3) Return borrowed items when you are done, and don't lose them; (4) If something is damaged, be sure to compensate at the price; (5) Do not beat or scold people, and thoroughly eliminate warlordism; (6) Do not damage crops, and pay attention to each seedling; (7) Absolutely do not flirt with women, and resolutely eliminate rogue habits; (8) Do not search the pockets of prisoners, and be sure to implement the lenient policy. If anyone mistreats prisoners, revolutionary discipline will punish them without mercy.
