Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—According to TASS, New York: The United States has recently been strenuously insisting on signing a bilateral military agreement with Mexico. This agreement would allow the United States to establish military bases and radar equipment within Mexican territory and would give the U.S. Navy the right to "defend" the Mexican coastline. In view of the fact that this agreement is in complete contradiction with the independence of Mexican national sovereignty, the Mexican government has refused to conclude such an agreement. However, the United States is exerting economic pressure on Mexico, refusing to supply Mexico with urgently needed equipment for the petroleum industry and railways.

　　墨西哥不顾美帝压迫
    拒绝缔结双边军事协定
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：最近美国正极力坚持与墨西哥签订双边军事协定，该协定将允许美国在墨西哥领土内建立军事基地及雷达设备，并将使美国海军有“防卫”墨西哥海岸线的权利。鉴于这一协定与墨西哥国家主权的独立完全抵触，墨政府拒绝缔结这种协定。但美国对墨西哥正施行经济压力，拒绝供给墨西哥迫切需要的石油工业及铁路的装备。
