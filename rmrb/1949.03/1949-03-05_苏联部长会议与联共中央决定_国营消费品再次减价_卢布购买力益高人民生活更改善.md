Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 4th: TASS, Moscow reports: The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on February 28, issued the "Decision on Further Reducing the Prices of Consumer Goods in State Retail Trade, effective March 1, 1949" as follows:

I. When monetary reform was implemented and the rationing system was abolished at the end of 1947, the high prices in commodity trade were eliminated; retail prices of consumer goods in state-owned trade were implemented at reduced, uniform prices. This was the first stage of price reduction for consumer goods. The first stage of price reductions made consumer goods in state retail trade at least 57 billion rubles cheaper in total over the course of a year. This sum became a pure loss in the state budget and had to be compensated. The government later relied on increased labor productivity, increased production of consumer goods, and reduced production costs to indeed compensate for this loss. On the other hand, this sum has become a pure gain for the people.

Not only that, the reduction of commodity prices in the state retail trade system is bound to cause, and indeed did cause, the same reduction in market prices in collective farms and cooperatives. The goods sold by collective farms and cooperatives account for nearly 33 percent of the total value of goods sold to the people, so the reduction in prices of goods in collective farm and cooperative trade made these goods at least 29 billion rubles cheaper in total.

Therefore, as a result of the price reductions in various sectors, the people have gained a total of nearly 86 billion rubles in one year.

This means that as a result of the first stage of price reductions, the purchasing power of the ruble has greatly increased, the exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies has also increased, the real wages of workers and intellectuals have greatly increased, and the expenses of farmers purchasing industrial products have also greatly decreased.

II. Because of the further upsurge of the Soviet national economy, the increase in the production of consumer goods, and the new achievements made in reducing production costs, it became possible in the second half of 1948 to implement new price reductions for consumer goods. The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to implement this new price reduction. This new price reduction has already partially begun in 1948 and will fully begin on March 1, 1949. This is the second stage of price reduction for consumer goods.

The new price reduction will make consumer goods in state retail trade at least 48 billion rubles cheaper in total over the course of a year. This loss in the state budget (which at the same time becomes a pure gain for the people) must and undoubtedly will be compensated by the government implementing certain economic measures, even though there are serious difficulties that must be overcome in compensating for this loss.

The new price reduction in state retail trade will immediately cause the same price reduction in cooperative and collective farm retail trade, and the people will therefore receive an additional gain of no less than 23 billion rubles.

Therefore, in this second stage, due to the new price reductions in various retail trades, the people's income in one year will total approximately 71 billion rubles.

This means that as a result of the new price reductions, the purchasing power of the ruble will again greatly increase, the exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies will also increase, the real wages of workers and intellectuals will again greatly increase, and the expenses of farmers purchasing industrial products will again greatly decrease. The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union hereby decide: A. Starting from March 1, 1949, reduce the prices of consumer goods in state retail trade as follows: Bread and flour by 10 percent, grains and pasta by 10 percent, feed, oil cakes, bran, and mixed feed by 20 percent, hay by 30 percent, biscuits, gingerbread, and cakes by 10 percent, meat, sausages, and canned food by 10 percent, fish and fish products by 10 percent, cheese, cream by 10 percent, dried cheese and sheep's milk cheese by 20 percent, salt by 30 percent, vodka by 28 percent, various beverages by 25 percent, wine, fine brandy, fruit wine by 15 percent, tobacco products by 10 percent, spices by 20 percent, coats, women's clothing, suits, and other wool clothing by 12 percent, women's clothing, shirts, work clothes, and other silk goods by 15 percent, wool fabrics by 10 percent, silk fabrics by 10 percent, clothing custom-made from stores and fashion houses by 20 percent, cotton thread by 15 percent, silk stockings and socks by 15 percent, boots and shoes made of textiles and composite materials by 50 percent, hats and caps by 50 percent, textile accessories by 50 percent, embroidery by 50 percent, fur by 10 percent, clothing made of metal and leather substitutes by 10 percent, bakelite and celluloid products (kitchen utensils, household utensils, etc.) by 20 percent, cutlery (knives, forks, spoons, etc.) by 10 percent, household electrical appliances (electric pots, electric stoves, electric irons, etc.) by 10 percent, ironware by 20 percent, horse gear by 20 percent, motorcycles by 15 percent, bicycles by 20 percent, radios by 20 percent, complete television sets by 25 percent, pianos, accordions, and organs by 20 percent, phonographs by 30 percent, phonograph records by 20 percent, clocks and watches by 30 percent, jewelry by 20 percent, typewriters by 20 percent, cameras, telescopes, and eyeglasses by 10 percent; at the same time, reduce prices in restaurants, cafeterias, tea rooms, and other food service establishments correspondingly.

B. Instruct the Soviet Ministry of Trade to concretely stipulate the new prices for food, feed, and industrial products listed in Section A of this decision that should be reduced in state retail trade in accordance with this decision.

　　苏联部长会议与联共中央决定
    国营消费品再次减价
    卢布购买力益高人民生活更改善
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央委员会，二月二十八日发布“自一九四九年三月一日起再次减低国营零售贸易中的消费品价格的决定”如下：
    一、当一九四七年年底实现货币改革并废除配给制的时候，就已消除了商品贸易中的高昂物价；国营贸易中消费品的零售，实行减低了的、统一的价格。那是减低消费品价格的第一阶段。第一阶段的减价，使国营零售贸易中的消费品价格，在一年中总共至少便宜了五百七十亿卢布。这笔款项成为国家预算中的纯损失，必须加以弥补。政府后来依靠劳动生产率的提高、消费品产量的增加及生产成本的减低，确已弥补了这笔损失。而另一方面，这笔款项却已成为人民的纯收益。
    不仅如此，国营零售贸易系统中商品价格的减低，势必引起、而且也确实引起了集体农场的与合作社的市场物价的同样减低。集体农场与合作社在一年内所售出的货物，在售予人民的商品总额中，几占百分之三十三，因此，集体农场与合作社贸易中的商品减价，使这些商品总共至少便宜了二百九十亿卢布。
    因此，各部门减低零售价格的结果，人民在一年中已总共获得了将近八百六十亿卢布的利益。
    这就是说：由于第一阶段减价的结果，卢布购买力已大大提高，卢布对外币的兑换率也已经提高，工人与知识分子的实际工资已大大增加，农民购买工业品的支出，也已大大降低。
    二、因为苏联国民经济的进一步高涨、消费品产量的增加以及在减低生产成本方面所达成的新成就，在一九四八年下半年，便已有可能实行消费品的新的减价。苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央委员会，就决计实行这个新的减价。这一新的减价已在一九四八年部分地开始，并在一九四九年三月一日全部开始。这是减低消费品价格的第二阶段。
    新减价将使国营零售贸易中的消费品价格，在一年期间总共至少便宜四百八十亿卢布。国家预算中的这笔损失（这同时却成为人民的纯收益），必须而且毫无疑问地将由政府实行若干经济措施来弥补，尽管在弥补这笔损失时，有必须克服的严重困难。
    国营零售贸易的新的减价，将立即引起合作社与集体农场零售贸易的同等减价，人民将又因此额外得到不下于二百三十亿卢布的收益。
    因此，在这第二阶段中，由于各种零售贸易的新的减价，人民在一年中的收益，总计将约为七百一十亿卢布。
    这就是说：由于新的减价的结果，卢布的购买力将再度大大提高，卢布对外币的兑换率也将提高，工人与知识分子的实际工资，将再度大大地增加，农民购买工业品的支出，将再度大大降低。苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央委员会兹特决定：甲、自一九四九年三月一日起，减低国营零售贸易中的消费品价格如下：面包与面粉减低百分之十，五谷与通心粉百分之十，饲料、油饼、麦麸、及混合饲料百分之二十，干草百分之三十，饼干、姜饼及饼百分之十，肉、香肠及罐头食品百分之十，鱼及鱼肉制品百分之十，乳酪、奶油百分之十，干酪及羊奶干酪百分之二十，盐百分之三十，伏特加酒百分之廿八，各种饮料百分之廿五，葡萄酒、上等白兰地酒、果子酒百分之十五，烟草制品百分之十，香料百分之廿，上衣、女衣、成套衣服及其他毛质衣服百分之十二，女衣、衬衫、工作服及其他丝货百分之十五，毛织物百分之十，丝织物百分之十，向商店与时装店中定制的衣服百分之廿，棉线百分之十五，丝织长统袜与短袜百分之十五，纺织品与复合物制成的靴鞋百分之五十，礼帽与便帽百分之五十，纺织品的服饰百分之五十，刺绣品百分之五十，毛皮百分之十，金属与皮革代用品制成的服饰百分之十，电木及赛璐等制品（厨房用具、家用器皿等等）百分之二十，刀剪类（刀、叉、匙等等）百分之十，家用电气用具（电锅、电炉、电熨斗等）百分之十，铁器百分之二十，马具百分之二十，机器脚踏车百分之十五，自行车百分之二十，无线电收音机百分之二十，成套的电视机百分之二十五，钢琴、手风琴及风琴百分之二十，留声机百分之三十，留声机唱片百分之二十，钟表百分之三十，珠宝百分之二十，打字机百分之二十，照像机、望远镜、眼镜类百分之十；同时，并与此相当地减低餐厅、食堂、茶室及其他饮食店中的价格。
    乙、训令苏联贸易部按照本决定，具体规定本决定甲项中所列举的食品、饲料及工业品在国营零售贸易中应予减低的新价格。
