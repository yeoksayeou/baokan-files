　　Suppressed Laborers' Creative Enthusiasm Encouraged Only After Shenyang's Liberation
　　Worker Gao Jingshui Successfully Trials Electric Welding Rods
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] Gao Jingshui, a worker at the Shenyang Railway Repair Factory, has successfully trialed electric welding rods (used for welding iron plates). This is an event of extreme importance to industrial production in the Northeast and has garnered attention from various regions. It resolves a difficulty regarding an important raw material in metallurgical industrial production. Shortly after the Shenyang Railway Repair Factory resumed operations, their supply of electric welding rods ran out. At this time, worker Gao Jingshui proposed to the factory that he had a formula for preparing electric welding rods, but had never actually made them before and was willing to try. The factory immediately supported his experiment, providing the necessary chemicals and technical assistance. Due to incorrect proportions of chemicals, the first two trials failed. After discussing the results with the technician, the chemical composition was adjusted and re-prepared. The resulting welding rods were used to weld iron plates, which were then tested. Under heavy pressure, the iron plate cracked, but the weld remained intact, and the experiment was a success. Electric welding of iron plates is a modern technique, and the preparation of electric welding rods is very complex. During the Japanese puppet Manchurian period, Gao Jingshui worked as an apprentice in a Fushun factory, where he spent his days crushing manganese and black lead powder, among other chemicals, for Japanese welding technicians, but he did not know what they were used for. The Japanese kept the preparation methods a closely guarded secret. After a few years, Gao Jingshui realized that these materials were raw materials used to make welding rods. From then on, he wanted to learn this technique, but the Japanese were very strict, giving him no time to do so. When Japan surrendered, Gao Jingshui was working in Huanggu Tun. As soon as he heard of Japan's surrender, he immediately sought out Fuyong, a Japanese technician who did welding, and said to him: "The Chinese people have been bullied by you for more than ten years. Now we can't let you roll back to your country for nothing. Quickly leave me the formula for making welding rods!" In this way, Gao Jingshui obtained a set (ten types) of formulas, but he did not understand chemistry and had no opportunity for practical experiments. Later, he learned about the chemistry questions he did not understand through various inquiries and consultations, and generally understood them, but under the rule of the Kuomintang, he still did not get the opportunity or possibility to experiment. This formula obtained when Japan surrendered, along with his creative enthusiasm, was buried for four years, until Shenyang's liberation last winter, when he was encouraged to experiment and achieved success. At the same time as Gao Jingshui's experiment, another worker, Liu Zhensheng, also presented a formula for experimentation. Liu's formula was stolen from a Japanese technician five or six years ago when he was working at the Fengtian Manufacturing Plant in Tiexi District, Shenyang. After the above news was published in the Northeast Daily, it immediately attracted the attention of many factories. The technical staff of the Boketu Locomotive Section of the Qiqihar Railway Administration wrote to Gao Jingshui and Liu Zhensheng on February 17th, requesting the content of the formula for trial production.

　　被埋没的劳动者创造热情
    直到沈阳解放才得到鼓励
    工人高景水试制电焊条成功
    【新华社沈阳四日电】沈阳铁路修理厂工人高景水试制电焊条（用以焊接铁板的）成功。这是最近东北工业生产上极为各地重视的事件。它解决了冶金工业生产中一项重要原料的困难。沈阳铁路修理工厂开工后不久，工厂里的电焊条用完了。这时，工人高景水向厂方提出他有配制电焊条的药方子，但是没有实际做过，愿意试做。工厂立即支持他进行试验，供给所需各种药品，并有技师予以指导帮助。由于药品比例不恰合，开始两次试制都失败了。与技师研究结果，将药品成份加以调整，重新配制，然后用制成的焊条去焊接铁板，再拿去试验，经加重大压力，铁板裂了，而焊口纹丝不动，实验终告成功。用电焊接铁板，是一种近代技术，电焊条的配制很复杂。高景水于伪满时代在抚顺工厂做学徒时，曾成天替日本电焊技师砸锰、砸黑铅粉等药品，但不知道是做什么用的。因为日本人把这种配制方法保守得很秘密。过了几年，高景水才知道这些东西是制造焊条用的原料。从此，他即想学会这一技术，但是日本鬼子管得很严，使他没有一点时间能这样做。日本投降时，当时高景水正在皇姑屯做活。他一听到日本投降，立刻去找做电焊的日本技师富永，并对他说：“中国人被你们欺侮了十几年，现在不能让你们白白滚回国去，快把做电焊条的药方子给我留下！”这样，高景水得到了一套（十种）药方子，但不懂化学，又没有人给他实际试验的机会。以后，化学上不懂的问题经他多方探问请教，大体上弄明白了，但是在国民党的统治下，他仍然没有得到实验的机会与可能。这个日本投降时得到的药方连同他的创造热情一同被埋没了四年，一直到去年冬沈阳解放后，才得到鼓励进行试验，并获得成功。与高景水的实验同时，另一工人刘振声也拿出一种药方来进行实验。刘的这一药方是五六年前他在沈阳铁西区奉天制作所做工时从日本技师处偷来的。上述消息在东北日报发表后，立即引起许多工厂的重视。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局博克图机务段技术室的人员已于二月十七日写信给高景水和刘振声，要求告诉药方的内容，以便进行试制。
