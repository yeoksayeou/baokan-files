　　Stalino Province Coal Mines Use New Coal Mining Machines
    [TASS Dispatch] The Gorlovka Machine-Building Plant has sent the first batch of new combined coal mining machines to the coal mines of Stalino Province and the Karaganda and Cheremkhovo coalfields. This machine can simultaneously mine coal, cut coal, and load coal onto the conveyor. The design of this new machine reflects the experience of Soviet engineers who have been engaged in creating combined coal mining machines for many years. As is well known, this machine was originally created according to drawings prepared by Soviet engineers as early as 1929 to 1930, when no other country in the world had begun to manufacture such combined coal mining machines. The new machine produced by the Gorlovka Machine-Building Plant is now considered to be one of the most successful of all existing combined coal mining machines. The output of this machine far exceeds that of all coal mining machines and can reduce the number of drivers by two-thirds.

　　斯大林诺省煤矿  使用新式采煤机
    【塔斯社电】哥尔罗夫卡机器制造厂向斯大林诺省各煤矿和卡拉冈达与彻林赫沃两处煤田发去第一批新式联合采煤机，这种机器能同时挖煤、砍煤和往运送机上装煤。这种新式机器之设计反映了苏联从事创造联合采煤机多年的工程师的经验。如所周知，这种机器最初是按照苏联工程师远在一九二九到一九三○年间即已准备的图样造成的，那时世界上还没有任何别的国家曾开始制造这种联合采煤机。现在哥尔罗夫卡机器制造厂制造的这种新式机器被认为是在一切现有的各式联合采煤机中最成功的一种。这种机器的产煤量远超过一切采煤机，并可减少两倍的驾驶员。
