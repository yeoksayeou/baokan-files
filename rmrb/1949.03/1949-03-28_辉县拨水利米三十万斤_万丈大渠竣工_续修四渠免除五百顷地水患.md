[Taihang Electric] The Huixian People's Government is actively leading the masses to manage river dikes and build water conservancy projects, turning hundreds of qing of swamps into fertile land. The 18-li-long Yuhekou Canal is nearing completion; four more canals are planned for further repair. The Yuhe River originates in Lingchuan, flowing down the mountains past the eighty beaches of Huixian County. Since the land reform, the masses have actively demanded the construction of water conservancy projects to increase production and become wealthy. After inspection by the county government, it was agreed to lend 30 million jin of millet for assistance. Villages along the Dan River formed a canal water conservancy committee, which, under the leadership of the county and district governments, began work in November last year. Despite continuous enemy attacks and looting before the new year, the 12,000-zhang-long project from Dawang Temple to the entrance has been basically completed after a hundred days of work with over 10,000 laborers. The entire canal is twelve zhang wide and five chi deep, with a water intake of thirty cubic feet. Each cubic foot of water can irrigate forty mu of land day and night, and the entire canal can irrigate more than 12,000 mu, which can be rotated every half month. If each mu increases production by two dou, the annual increase will be 2,400 shi. After repaying the government's grain loan, there will still be an extra 130,000 jin in the first year. The masses in the area are all overjoyed, praising the government for its meritorious service to the people. Continuing repairs are currently underway, and it is expected that water can be blocked and entered by the end of the second month of the lunar calendar. After completion, the four river canals of Sizhuang, Wangfan, and Fengcheng in the sixth district and Guanlang Bridge to Liuqiao in the ninth district will continue to be repaired. A total of 96,368 workers are required. After the repair is completed, the increase in production will be more than ten times the consumption. Nineteen administrative villages, including Mujia Ying, have suffered from floods for a long time and have not seen a grain of millet for two or three years. After the repair, 466 qing of fertile land will be free from floods, and the cultivated area can be expanded by 69 qing, turning 10 qing of dry land into paddy fields. With an increase of five dou per mu, each season can produce an additional 26,975 shi.

　　辉县拨水利米三十万斤
  　万丈大渠竣工
    续修四渠免除五百顷地水患
    【太行电】辉县人民政府积极领导群众治理河堤，兴修水利，数百顷沼泽将变为良田。长达十八里之峪河口渠，已将竣工；尚有四道河渠，正拟加修。按峪河发源于陵川，经辉县八十滩头之大山旁顺流而下。自经土地改革后，群众积极要求兴修水利，增产致富，经县府派员视察后，允借小米三千万斤资助。沿丹河各村即组成开渠水利委员会，在县、区政府领导下，于去年十一月开工。年前虽因敌不断进攻劫掠，但先后百日，用工万余，已使大王庙至入口处的万二千丈长的工程基本上完成。全渠计宽丈二，深五尺，入水量三十方尺，每方尺水一昼夜可浇四十亩地，全渠可灌溉一万二千余亩，每半月可轮浇一遍。每亩若以增产二斗计，一年可增产两千四百石，除还清政府借粮外，则第一年还多打十三万斤。该地群众无不喜形于色，感颂政府为民立功。刻正继续赶修，预计阴历二月底，可堵水入口。竣工后，将继续加修六区之寺庄、王范、丰城与九区之官廊桥至刘桥的四道河渠。共需工九万六千三百六十八个，修成后，增产可大过消耗量的十倍。穆家营等十九个行政村，久历水灾，两三年未见粒粟，修好后，四百六十六顷良田即可免遭水灾，并可扩大耕地面积六十九顷，变旱田为水田十顷。以每亩增产五斗计，每季可多产二万六千九百七十五石。
