Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: Workers in seven major state-owned enterprises in Northeast China are actively preparing to welcome the official implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations on April 1 with great excitement. The Northeast Fourth Coal Mine District has largely completed its investigation into the age, length of service, and directly related family members supported by workers. Through this investigation, the political consciousness of workers has generally improved. After the investigation, the coal mining team of the Fuguo Mine in the mine district automatically initiated a production competition to ensure improved quality. The horse-powered transport road between the Dacheng and Fuguo mines, which had been broken for a long time and had not been repaired, was repaired by workers on their own initiative during the labor insurance registration period, and was completed eight days ahead of the original plan. Workers who were unwilling to work as miners in the past are now actively requesting registration. The workers also stated that they will respond to the democratic government's care for the workers by increasing the amount of coal mined.

The railway and postal and telecommunications systems completed all investigation and registration work in the middle of this month. The Second, Third, and Fourth Textile Factories under the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau, the factories under the Third Bureau of the General Logistics Department, and the Jilin Electric Power Bureau all ran short-term labor insurance training classes before conducting investigation and registration, drawing workers to study the Labor Insurance Regulations and their detailed rules and registration methods. After receiving training, the workers assisted in registration and carried out publicity and explanation among the workers, enabling the labor insurance registration to be completed quickly.

Various state-owned enterprises and relevant government departments are also actively rectifying and strengthening the medical equipment for employees. The Health Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has changed the original Shenyang Red Cross Hospital into a workers' hospital led by the Labor Protection Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. The Health Department also plans to establish another workers' hospital and two sanatoriums, and has sent a large number of doctors with medicines to the military industry and general logistics enterprises to help improve factory medical work. The former Disabled Hospital in the First Coal Mine District has been taken over by the Labor Protection Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and renamed the North Manchuria Workers' Disabled Hospital. Postal and telecommunications workers' hospitals in Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, and Qiqihar have been established. The Northeast Electric Power Administration Bureau and the First Bureau of the General Logistics Department are also actively preparing to build workers' hospitals. The Northeast Railway Administration plans to establish three workers' sanatoriums. The sanatoriums for postal and telecommunications, highway, and shipping systems have been started by the Transportation Department of the Northeast Government Committee after selecting sites. The sixteen factories under the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau are working to rectify and add medical clinics. In order to expand medical equipment, the Shenyang Electrical Manufacturing Plant has allocated 100 million yuan to purchase medicines and diagnostic equipment.
