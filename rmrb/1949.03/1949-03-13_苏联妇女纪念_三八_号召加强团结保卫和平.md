Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 11th (via TASS, Moscow, March 7th): Soviet women, an advanced detachment of the Women's International Democratic Federation, are commemorating "March 8th" by strengthening the international unity of democratic women worldwide in the common cause of opposing the imperialists' instigation of a new war and striving for peace and democracy. In Moscow, Leningrad, and other important Soviet cities, meetings have been held to discuss the results of the Second International Women's Congress, unanimously endorsing the Congress's decisions and warmly welcoming the declaration issued by the Congress to defend world peace. The resolution passed by the Moscow women's meeting stated: "The resolution adopted by the Second Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation to struggle for lasting peace and against warmongers once again proves that the Federation is a powerful force in the worldwide camp striving for peace and democracy." The Rostov women's congress passed a resolution stating: "In the common struggle, we extend our friendly hands from afar to our laboring women sisters in foreign countries, and call on them to unite in the struggle to defend peace. Our strength is infinite, and we will surely win!"
    Soviet women actively participate in all measures of the Women's International Democratic Federation to defend peace. In countless meetings, Soviet women have protested the bloody terror of Franco in Spain, protested the terror in Greece, demanded that Dutch troops withdraw from Indonesia, and demanded that the Republic of Indonesia be recognized as an independent nation. Petrova, the secretary of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, stated in a speech: "Last year, during the meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women of the United Nations Economic and Social Council in July and August, the Soviet representative Pavlov, together with the representatives of Belarus, Poland, and the French delegation, enabled the meeting to pass a resolution calling for the elimination of economic and political inequalities for women, and granting them equal rights to education. As in the past, Soviet women will make every effort to help the International Women's Federation realize this decision; they stand shoulder to shoulder with the entire Soviet people at the forefront of the democratic camp, fighting for peace, democracy, and against the instigators of a new war."

　　苏联妇女纪念“三八”
    号召加强团结保卫和平
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科七日电：世界民主妇女联盟先进支队之一的苏联妇女，在反对帝国主义挑拨新战争、争取和平与民主的共同事业中，正以加强全世界民主妇女的国际团结来纪念“三八”节。在莫斯科、列宁格勒及其他苏联的重要城市，均集会讨论第二届国际妇女代表大会的成果，一致拥护大会的决定，并热烈欢迎大会所发表的保卫世界和平的宣言。莫斯科妇女的会议所通过的决议称：世界民主妇女联盟第二届代表大会所通过的为持久和平与反对战争贩子而斗争的决议，再次证明了妇联在全世界争取和平与民主的阵营中，是一支强大的力量。罗斯托夫的妇女大会通过决议称：在共同的斗争中，我们从远方向外国的劳动妇女姊妹们伸出我们友谊的手，并号召他们在保卫和平的斗争中团结一致。我们的力量是无穷无尽的，我们一定胜利！
    苏联妇女积极地参加世界民主妇联保卫和平的一切措施。在无数的会议中苏联妇女都抗议西班牙佛朗哥的血腥恐怖统治，抗议希腊恐怖，要求荷军撤离印尼，要求承认印尼共和国为独立国。苏联妇女反法西斯委员会书记彼得洛娃发表谈话称：去年七八月间在联合国经济理事会会议上讨论妇女地位问题委员会的报告时，苏联代表巴夫洛夫与白俄罗斯、波兰的代表及法国代表团使这次会议通过了一项决议，号召取消妇女在经济上政治上的不平等，并予她们以受教育的一切平等权利。和过去一样，苏联妇女将尽一切努力帮助国际妇联实现这一决定；她们与全体苏联人民肩并肩地站在民主阵营的前列，正为和平、民主与反对新战争挑拨者而斗争。
