　　Jizhong Area Zhuo-Liang-Wan
  　Registering Enemy and Puppet Personnel
    [Jizhong Electric] Zhuo-Liang-Wan (newly established county, including parts of Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, and Wanping) conducted a propaganda blitz week during the Spring Festival. The entire county, based on sub-districts, universally convened meetings of families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, families of victims, workers, and farmers. During the meetings, all puppet Baojia personnel were also ordered to attend, standing on the side to listen to instructions. The government pointed out that the puppet Baojia system was the grassroots organization of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and must be abolished. The masses, who had been oppressed by the enemy and puppets for many years, were thus liberated, and the people could establish political power according to their own opinions. When our cadres in Panggezhuang exposed the crimes of the puppet personnel, two old men and an old lady said, "In the past, the poor had to take on corvee labor, while the rich didn't. They used old scales for measurement, even putting iron rings on the weight to cheat. When handing over grain, they used new scales.” During a meeting in the first district, the attending masses accused the enemy and puppet personnel of their crimes. Wang Lin said, "On December 28th of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], because I was a member of the Farmers' Association, I was fined 250,000 yuan and a fat pig, and I was also taken to a blockhouse and detained.” The family member of a martyr in Ci Village said angrily, "The head of the large township, Liu Yuqing, tore down my house." Wang You said, "The intelligence agent Li Shiru killed my father." According to the opinions of the masses, our district government immediately detained Liu Yuqing and the murderer Li Shiru. A member of the masses in Xiaosi Village in the seventh district said angrily at the meeting, "The people who worked in the puppet office in the past drove us to ruin, taking all our grain and quilts!" At the meetings in various sub-districts, the government announced that the following four points must be done by general puppet personnel at present: 1. All personnel of puppet organizations must register with the government; 2. All military supplies and materials of puppet organizations must be completely handed over, and no bandits or secret agents are allowed to be hidden, those who do not report will be punished as the same crime; 3. No illegal destructive activities are allowed; 4. The safety of cadres and people must be guaranteed. If any rumors or assassinations are discovered, they must bear full responsibility. And it called on the masses, if they do not implement it, the masses can report and expose them, and they will be severely punished. After the meeting, the arrogance of the puppet personnel began to decline. The first district office received thirteen guns, more than 1,400 bullets, and twenty members of the Kuomintang secret service organization registered with the government surrendered by the puppet personnel. One hundred and sixty-six puppet personnel from four villages including Wanquanzhuang registered, one hundred and ninety Chiang bandit soldiers from three villages including Feng Village registered, and puppet organization personnel in other districts are also registering with the government. The broad masses of people are generally enthusiastic, and voluntarily go to the district government to request the transformation of the village government and the rapid establishment of the people's political power.
