　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Indonesian guerrillas are increasingly active. According to the Associated Press, powerful Indonesian guerrillas attacked Sukabumi City (60 miles south of Batavia) in West Java on the 14th, killing and wounding several Dutch soldiers. The city was a rear base for the Dutch army before the December 19th incident last year. In East Java, due to the intensification of guerrilla activities, another nineteen large coffee, rubber, and tea plantations have ceased operations. According to Agence France-Presse on the 14th, citing so-called "authoritative sources" in Batavia, the production of Indonesian coffee, rubber, and tea has been severely reduced. The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on the 10th that in natural rubber alone, Indonesia's production (including all of Indonesia outside the former Republic) has fallen from 23,700 tons in December 1948 to 15,700 tons.

　　印尼游击队攻入苏卡布米城
    【新华社陕北十七日电】印尼游击队活动频繁。据美联社讯，强大的印尼游击队十四日攻入西爪哇的苏卡布米城（巴达维亚以南六十里）毙伤荷军多名。该城为去年十二月十九日事变以前的荷军后方。东爪哇方面，由于游击队活动的加强，又有十九个咖啡、橡皮、与茶叶的大种植园停止工作。据法新社十四日引巴达维亚的所谓“权威人士”称：印尼咖啡、橡皮与茶叶的产量已受到严重消减。美商务部十日宣布，仅天然橡胶一项，印尼（包括前共和国以外的全印尼）的产量已自一九四八年十二月的二万三千七百吨跌至一万五千七百吨。
