　　Jingxing Strengthens Women's Work
  　Stops Infringements of Women's Rights
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Jingxing County Party Committee resolutely safeguards women's property rights and freedom of marriage, and corrects some unreasonable phenomena currently existing in rural areas. Recently, the county has seen cases of violation of women's freedom of marriage and land ownership. In Sunzhuang Village, Third District, woman Qi Rongzhu requested to dissolve her non-voluntary engagement with Gao Haihai. The village cadres' attitude was: "Rather break a thousand families than ruin one marriage," forcing Qi Rongzhu not to dissolve the engagement. In Yinxihe, Fifth District, Wang Suqing (female) requested a divorce due to poor marital relations, but the village chief obstructed her and did not introduce her to the district. In Xihe, Fourth District, Ma Erbang requested a divorce from the village cadres, but the cadres not only did not assist her but also said the woman was a hooligan, believing that women who filed for divorce were violating the law. In Yangqing Village, Third District, after Yang Mizhi divorced, she requested to take away her due share of land, but the man refused and she appealed. In Liangruijin, Seventh District, Liang Ruijin's father coveted Bai Yang's one hundred and fifty yuan and forced his daughter to marry a landlord. Liang Ruijin was dissatisfied with the marriage and ran away after being beaten by her father. In Qiujiayan, Fourth District, Zhang Heini serves as the chairman of the Women's Federation in the village, but her husband prevented her from going out to work, and because she filed for divorce, she was severely beaten by her husband, forcing her to flee to her parents' home.
    In order to protect freedom of marriage and women's land and property rights, and to stop the criminal behavior of beating women, the Jingxing County Party Committee, in addition to handling the above serious infringements of women's rights separately, instructed all districts, with the instructions stating in brief: Women should be entitled to their share of land and property in the distribution, and they are free to handle their marriage, take it away, or sell it. No one shall interfere. When filling out land certificates in the land distribution process, the names of women can be filled in based on family circumstances and women's opinions. Cadres should conduct propaganda among the masses, explaining that men and women have the same right to a share of land and property, and mobilize and educate women to actively participate in labor production to improve their status. Secondly, it pointed out: To implement the correct marriage policy, it is necessary to first educate the masses and cadres, but policy implementation should not be hampered by cadres' lack of understanding. Oppose arranged marriages and various old habits that restrict freedom of marriage. If marital relations are poor and one party requests a divorce, the government should handle it according to the specific circumstances and with reference to the opinions of the masses; if they really cannot live together, the divorce can be approved. Applications for divorce can be made directly to the district without going through the village government. The instructions concluded: Around the March 8th International Women's Day, widespread propaganda should be carried out among the masses, explaining the evils of arranged marriages and using examples of free marriages to educate the masses. Oppose the bureaucratic attitude of not caring about women's suffering, and recognize that much of women's suffering is the residue of the old society and a social problem. It can only be solved by mobilizing the masses and raising the awareness of the broad masses of women.

　　井陉加强妇运工作
  　制止侵犯妇女权利
    【本报讯】井陉县委，坚决保障妇女财产权利及婚姻自由，纠正目前农村中存在的一些不合理现象。该县最近有违犯妇女婚姻自由，及土地所有权等事。三区孙庄村，妇女齐荣竹提出与非自愿的未婚夫高海海解除婚约，该村干部所表示的态度是：“能坏千家事不坏一门亲”，强迫齐荣竹不准解除婚约。五区尹西河王素卿（女）因夫妇感情恶劣，要求离婚，村长从中阻碍，不给介绍到区。四区西河马二棒向村干提出离婚，村干不但不予协助，反说该妇女是流氓，认为提离婚的妇女就是违法。三区杨青村杨蜜芝离婚后要求带走自己应得的一份土地，男方不允许又上告。七区梁瑞金的父亲贪图白洋一百五十元，强迫女儿与地主结婚，梁瑞金对婚姻不满，遭受父亲的打骂后逃跑了。四区秋家岩张黑妮，在村中当妇联会主席，其夫阻当不叫她出门工作，又因她提出离婚，就遭受丈夫的毒打，被打得逃到娘家去。
    为了保障婚姻自由，及妇女的土地财产权利，制止打骂妇女的犯罪行为，井陉县委除将以上严重侵犯妇女权利事，分别处理外，并指示各区，指示略称：妇女在平分中，应得的一份土地财产，本人嫁娶，带走、出卖等，由个人自由处理，任何人不得干涉，在平分土地填写土地证时，根据家庭情况及妇女意见，可填写妇女名字，干部要在群众中进行宣传，说明男女有同样一份土地财产的权利，并发动教育妇女很好参加劳动生产，以提高自己的地位。其次指出：执行正确的婚姻政策，首先打通群众干部思想是需要的，但不能因村干部思想不通，就不执行政策。反对包办、限制婚姻自由的各种旧习惯。夫妇感情恶劣，如一方提出离婚，政府应根据具体情形及参酌群众意见处理；如确实不能同居，即可批准离婚，到区申请离婚，可以不要村政府手续。指示最后指出：在三八节前后要向群众广泛的进行宣传，说明包办婚姻的坏处，用典型的自由婚姻的例子，教育群众。反对不关心妇女痛苦的官僚主义，要认识妇女的许多痛苦，是旧社会流传下来的余毒，是一个社会问题。要发动群众，并提高广大妇女的觉悟才能解决。
