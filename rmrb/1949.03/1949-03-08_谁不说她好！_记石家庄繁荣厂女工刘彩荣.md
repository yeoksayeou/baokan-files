　　Who Doesn't Say She's Good!
    — A Record of Liu Cairong, a Female Worker at the Shijiazhuang Prosperity Factory
    Luo Xin
    Liu Cairong, a female watch worker in Team C of the Shijiazhuang Prosperity Factory, it's not just me saying it, you can ask the administrator, the team leader; ask the doffers, the watch workers, who doesn't say she's good! Almost every time there's praise, her name is always mentioned, just this year, in January and February, not to mention anything else, just the red flag alone, she's gotten it five times.
    That positive energy in her work, I don't need to tell you, when it comes to splicing threads, she splices them firmly; when it comes to cleaning the machines, whenever you go to look, the machines are always bright and shiny, eh! She's just different from others in this regard, she's consistent, whenever she has time, she wipes the machines and tightens the spindles, whether it's cleaning time or not, she's always doing it, you think, how could the machines ever get dirty?
    This is still a small thing, this doesn't even count, her goodness is that she doesn't just focus on keeping her own machine in good condition, she also squeezes out time to help other machines. You know, the busiest time is right after doffing, at this time, you have to put on the thread, splice the ends, and tighten the spindles, you're sweating from all the work, but Liu Cairong often uses this time, after quickly tidying up her own machine, to go help put the thread on other machines. When it's time to get off work, many people tidy themselves, comb their hair, and wait for the bell to ring, but she uses this time to help others, often rushing to sweep herself off and comb her hair after the bell has rung. Seeing her like this, the people in her group also go to help others, so everyone works together without any separation. Eh, there are many more things like this, for example, sweeping the floor, she sweeps when it's her turn, and she sweeps even when it's not her turn; she sweeps her own machine's side, and also the side of the machine next to hers. Sometimes, when there's a problem with another machine, the team leader asks everyone to help, and she's always there when called, she's really helpful!
    This still doesn't count, the best thing is that she's most obedient to command, obedient to transfers, you can tell her to do anything, and she'll definitely do it for you, the last time there was a big transfer, some people were being transferred from large ring spinning frames to small ring spinning frames, some thought the small ring spinning frames were harder to work with and didn't want to go; some were used to their own machines and didn't want to go; some were familiar with certain people and didn't want to separate, so they didn't want to go either, but Liu Cairong said: "I obey the organization, I'll go wherever I'm transferred." She worked just as positively on the other machine. She's skilled and quick, she's not always been watching over one machine, she's often transferred to wherever there's a shortage of people, she says: "Tell me to do anything, and I'll do it." Tell her to watch the spindles more, and she'll watch them more, tell her to watch them less, and she'll watch them less.
    In terms of uniting people, because she can help others, and she doesn't put on airs, and she doesn't lose her temper, you think, who wouldn't want to be close to her? I'm not just saying this, ask around, who doesn't say she's good!
    She is a Communist Party member, her high degree of proactive work, obedience to the organization, spirit of helping and uniting others, and great working-class character, we should really learn from her!

　　谁不说她好！
    ——记石家庄繁荣厂女工刘彩荣
    洛辛
    石家庄繁荣厂丙班看车女工刘彩荣，不是我说，你打问打问管理员、组长；打问问落纱工、看车工，谁不说她好！不管那次受表扬，差不多都少不了她的份儿，光今年一、二月份，别的不说，单说红旗，她就得了五次。
    工作上那股子的积极劲儿，不用我说，讲接线，是她接的牢；讲清洁车，你多会去看，多会车上是明光光的，呃！她和别人就有这点不同，有常性，有空就擦车、勒毛轴，到清洁车的时候是那样，就不是清洁车的时候也是那样，你想，车还能脏的了？
    这还是小事，这还不算，她的好呀，是好在不光是把自己这台车看好了就算了，她还挤时间去帮助别的车。你知道活儿最紧的，是刚落完纱的时候，这会儿，又要上线，又要接头，又要勒毛轴，做活出汗就在这个时候，可是，刘彩荣常常在这会儿，把自己车急急忙忙收拾好后，就到旁的车上帮助上线去了。下班的时候，好些都是自己车上搞好后，就扫身、梳头，等着下班铃好走，只她在这会儿，是去帮别的车上的忙，常常是摇了下班铃，她才匆匆忙忙的扫扫身上，刮刮头发。她们那车的人，见她这样儿，也都跟她一块儿去帮别车的忙，干活就这样不分你我。呃，要说这样的事儿还多咧，比如扫地吧，该她扫她扫，不该她扫她也扫；扫自己车这边，也扫挨着她车的别人那边。有时候，别的车上出了毛病，组长便叫大伙儿去帮忙，她是一叫就到，可真算能帮助人呀！
    这还不算，最好的，还是她最能服从指挥，服从调动、叫干个什么，准没有错儿，就给你办了，上回大调动，有些人要从大钢领车，调到小钢领车，有的嫌小钢领车活儿不好做，不愿去；有的看惯了自个儿这台车，不愿去；有的跟谁一块儿熟了，不愿分开，也不愿去，可是刘彩荣说：“我服从组织，调那儿就那儿。”到别的车上，一样积极干活。她手艺好，干的又急，她没老在一台车上干看领车，常是那儿缺人，就调她到那儿，她说：“叫干什么，就干什么。”叫多看毛轴，就多看，叫少看毛轴，就少看。
    在团结人方面，因为她能帮助别人，又不耍态度，又不发脾气，你想，谁不愿接近她咧？旁的不说，你问问，谁又不说她好呢！
    她是共产党党员，她这种高度的积极工作，服从组织，帮助与团结别人的精神，伟大的工人本色，咱们真该好好的向她学习咧！
