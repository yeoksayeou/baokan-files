　　Northward March Diary

    Got up at 5 AM and set off at 6 AM, continuing the northward march.

    This area is still deep in the mountains. According to the locals, the mountain path from the village to the summit is 25 li.

    The mountain gully is narrow and slippery. Besides the dense forests, there is ice all over the road. It's difficult for pack animals to travel, so the handlers help each other, mostly falling behind the troops.

    The mountain is indeed quite high. Looking back, the peaks are already under our feet, but the higher mountains ahead still block the way. After 2 PM, we finally crossed the mountain and reached Wubao Village, north of Fanshan Fort, at dusk.

    The situation is very tense. All the brother units have engaged the enemy, and the sound of artillery fire is coming from the front. We are ordered to attack quickly and set off early tomorrow at dawn!

    Arriving in this familiar Fanshan area, the locals are even more enthusiastic towards us. In order to execute the battle orders, the troops marched north along the Zhuo-Fan Highway in broad daylight, heading north of the Sanggan River.

    It's so cold. We were lying in the roadside ditch, waiting to build a bridge to cross the river. After resting, our hands and feet were frozen stiff.

    My North China Field Army, in close coordination with the Northeast Brother Corps, is fighting to annihilate the defending enemy in North China. With thirteen days of continuous marching, we rushed to the Ping-Sui Railway. My northward march diary records our firm will to annihilate the enemy. High mountains and steep ridges cannot stop us, and the icy river of winter cannot hold us back. We bravely enter the position to encircle and annihilate the enemy.

    The tenth day of the march. Today's journey involves overlapping mountains. After passing one mountain, another large mountain of over twenty li appears. Resting halfway up the mountain is extremely pleasant! The order "No hats off" is constantly being passed down, for fear of catching a cold.

    Our队伍(troops) are advancing on the winding mountain path halfway up the mountain. The mountain is steep and the road is narrow, but the marching speed is very fast. We only reached the northern Bianqiao Village at 10 AM, where the locals had already prepared a large amount of tea for us.

    After passing two large mountains, the road north is easier to travel. The troops continue to advance, spending the night at Shuangtangjian Village.

    When crossing the river, enemy planes were still circling overhead. The troops advanced quickly with a five-step distance between each person, safely breaking through the big river. At four o'clock, we stayed in Xiataifu Village.

    As dusk approached, we began to march again under the moonlight.
    　　　　
            December 8th, Cloudy and Snowy

    After marching all day yesterday, we only fell asleep at 1 AM tonight.

    "Xuanhua liberated, annihilating one enemy division, the bandit army is fleeing east." Upon receiving this news, the troops were immediately ordered to set off to intercept and annihilate the enemy. Everyone was preparing everything in the dark, and everyone's fighting spirit was uncontrollable.

    We were ordered to depart three times, but each time it was called off for various reasons. The final departure time was 4 AM.

    The journey is not far (twenty li), but we have to cross the Yang River. The riverbed is very wide, and the ice is still thin. Comrade engineers are already building a pontoon bridge ahead. The first ice river is over twenty zhang wide, and we crossed it by stepping on planks. Everyone felt that crossing the river was so easy. But after a sprint across the sandy beach, we finally saw the main river. According to people from the other side, the riverbed is about two li wide, which made everyone nervous again. The river ice could barely hold people, with a layer of floating water on top. The troops still crossed on planks. Suddenly, the order was given: "Prepare to wade!" It's December in the severe winter, and we are in the cold of Chahar, so the coldness is imaginable. The troops continued to advance.

    Suddenly, we heard the sound of wading in front. The first few comrades had already stepped in a few steps, and their shoes, socks, and trouser legs were all wet. The cold could not stop our ambition, so we simply stepped into the half-foot-deep ice.

    The coldness went from our feet to our heads. We clenched our fists, gritted our teeth, and lost all sensation in our knees and feet. We didn't even feel the pain when ice hit our feet and legs. After twenty minutes, everyone began to step onto the white sand, running hard to increase blood circulation and warm our feet and legs. After a while, we felt our feet swell up.

    After crossing the river, the first thing I saw was that the leaders of the column were just like everyone else, with their shoes, socks, and trouser legs half wet. I forgot my own cold and felt that they were suffering from the cold, and my respect for them deepened. The troops continued to advance. Difficulties cannot stop us. At dawn, we entered Yanjiafang Village. The main force had advanced to the outskirts of Xinbaoan and joined hands with our brother columns, tightly surrounding the bandit army, sealing its fate of complete annihilation.

　　北进日记
    吴旭文
            十二月六日　晴
    早五时起床，六时出发，继向北进。
    这一带仍是深山地区，据老乡谈：从村边开始爬山至山头二十五华里，都是小道。
    山沟里路窄而滑，除丛生之树林外，便是道上冰琳，牲口驮子很难行进，饲养员同志们互相帮忙扶着，大都丢在了部队的后面。
    山的确有些高了，向后望去群峰已踏在了脚底，前面的高山尚挡住去路。十四点过后，算过了山，黄昏到达目的地——矾山堡北的五堡村。
    情况紧张的很，各兄弟部队都打响了，前方传来了轰隆的炮声，命令要我们赶紧打上去，明天拂晓还要提前出发哩！
    　　　　十二月七日　晴
    到了这熟习的矾山地区，老乡们对我们更为亲热。我们为了执行战斗命令，部队大白天顺着涿矾公路北进了，要到桑干河以北去。
    天这样的冷，我们爬在道沟里，等着架桥渡河，休息下来，手脚都冻僵了。
    我华北野战军为了密切配合东北兄弟兵团作战全歼华北守敌，以十三天的连续行军，赶至平绥线。我的北上日记中，记载着我们歼敌的坚决意志，高山峻岭阻不了，严冬的冰河拦不住，英勇地进入围歼敌军的阵地。
    　　　　十二月五日　晴
    进军中之第十日了。今天的行程中，群山重叠，过了一个山头，又出来了一个上下二十余里的大山，坐在半山腰休息，痛快的很！“不许脱帽”的口令不时传下，是怕大家感冒了。
    我们队伍在山腰羊肠小道上前进着，山斜路窄，但行军速度却很快。上午十时，才抵达山麓的北边桥村，老乡已给我们准备了大批的茶水。
    两个大山头过去后，路北较好走些了，部队继续前进，宿夜于双堂涧村。
    渡河时，敌机尚在头顶盘旋，部队以每人五步之距离快步前进，安然突过大河，下四点住于下太府村。
    天近黄昏时，我们又在月夜下开始进军了。
    　　　　十二月八日　阴雪
    昨日行军一天，今夜一时才得入睡。
    “宣化解放歼敌一师，匪军正东窜中。”这一消息传来，部队马上要出发，截歼该敌。大家在黑暗中整理一切，大家战斗的心已收不住了。
    三次命令出发，三次因故中止，最后出发的时间是早晨四点。
    路程不远（二十华里），但要过洋河，河床很宽，河冰尚薄。工兵同志们已在前边搭浮桥。第一道冰河宽二十余丈踏着门板而过，大家觉着过河也就是这么容易。那知一阵沙滩急行军过后，前面方看到正河身，据对岸来人谈：河床有二里来宽，这才又使大家精神紧张起来，河冰刚托得住人，上有一层浮水，队伍仍踏着门板而过。骤然传下了命令：“准备涉水！”十二月严冬，又在寒风凛冽之察南，冷是可以想见的。部队不停的前进。
    忽然前面听到哗哗的涉水声了，前头几个同志已踏进去了几步，鞋、袜、裤口都湿了。寒冷阻挡不了志气，索性就踏进了尺半深的冰凌里。
    凉从脚底凉到头顶，握紧了拳，咬紧了牙，膝盖至脚板全无知觉了，冰块打到脚上腿上也不知疼。二十分钟过后，大家开始踏上白沙地，努力的跑，增加血液循环，使脚腿发暖。一会儿，脚底感到发涨起来。
    过河来，我首先看到纵队首长也和大家一样鞋、袜、裤脚都湿了半截，我忘了自己冷，而觉得他们是受了冷了，心里更加深了对他们的尊敬。部队又继续开进了，困难是阻止不住我们的，天明进住严家房村，主力已进至新保安之城郊与我兄弟纵队拉起了手，紧紧包死了匪军，铸定了他全部被歼的命运。
