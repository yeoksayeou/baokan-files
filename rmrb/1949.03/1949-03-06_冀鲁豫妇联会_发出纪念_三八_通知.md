Hebei-Shandong-Henan Women's Federation
　Issues Notice Commemorating "March 8th"
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Women's Federation, in commemoration of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, issued a special notice to women's federations in various regions on February 26th, based on the notice from the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and after specific research on commemorative methods and key points of propaganda. The notice pointed out regarding commemorative methods: In old liberated areas, newly recovered areas, and various cities, the county women's federations should take the lead in organizing preparatory committees to conduct propaganda through women's mass meetings (or focused mobilization meetings), symposiums, and other means, to educate members. Female workers, female students, and female cadres in factories, schools, and government organs should also participate in the commemorative meetings. The key points of propaganda proposed are: (1) Conduct education on "carrying the revolution through to the end," combining it with the Kuomintang bandit army's atrocities in various aspects, such as the trampling of women, to raise women's awareness and revengeful enthusiasm. Coordinate with our region's military recruitment task, mobilize husbands and sons to join the army to carry the revolution through to the end, and expose the enemy's false peace conspiracies, to commemorate "March 8th" with practical actions. (2) Explain the great contributions women have made in past movements such as land reform, production, supporting the front lines, and managing the Yellow River, and on this basis, continue to actively support the front lines and participate in agricultural production to achieve the liberation of women nationwide. (3) In the old liberated areas, the broad masses of women should be informed that we had previously experienced deviations in the independent movement, so that they can understand the future direction, tasks, and policies of the women's movement. (4) In the commemoration of "March 8th," efforts should be made to consolidate and restore women's organizations, strengthen organizational education, and explain that there is strength only when organized. The notice concluded by pointing out: Reports on the implementation of the above instructions should be written at any time and sent directly to the newspaper so that experiences can be exchanged between regions at any time.
