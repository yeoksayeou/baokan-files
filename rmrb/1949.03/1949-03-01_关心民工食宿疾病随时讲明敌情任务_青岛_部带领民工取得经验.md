Caring for Laborers' Food, Lodging, and Illnesses, Explaining the Enemy Situation and Tasks at Any Time
"Qingdao" Unit Leads Laborers to Gain Experience

[This newspaper report] The "Qingdao" unit of the "Yellow River" corps of the North China Field Army created experience in leading laborers during the autumn offensive last year. The political department of the corps issued a notice, calling on the entire army to learn from it. The "Qingdao" unit accepted two batches of stretchers from Ji-Lu-Yu, a total of 110 (50 from Weinan County and 60 from Changyuan County), with 660 laborers. They successively went through the Jixian and Xinxiang outer battles, lasting more than a month. Not only did no laborers escape, but they also highly developed the laborers' enthusiasm for participating in the war. When fighting in Jixian, all the laborers took off their clothes and waded through the water in the extremely cold weather, but no one complained, and said, "We will not go home until the task of attacking Jixian is completed." One day, it was drizzling, and the laborers were afraid of wetting the shells on the stretchers, so they took off their cotton gowns to cover the shells, willingly enduring the cold. They carried the wounded gently. In more than a month of operations in the new district, the laborers maintained good mass discipline like the troops. In each battle, they were able to help the troops successfully complete their tasks. The reason why the unit achieved such results in its relationship with the laborers is mainly due to the following experiences: First, actively carry out various educations: First of all, based on the laborers' concerns about rushing to the front line to grab the colorful flags, fearing planes, artillery, stepping on landmines, crossing the Yellow River, and going hungry, conduct ideological education to eliminate fears, held a general meeting of all laborers, started from the current situation to lay the foundation for victory, and further made them realize for whom the army is fighting, and for whom are they carrying stretchers? Carrying stretchers is not for the army's business trip, the army is for the people, that is, fighting to serve everyone and create happiness. Then explain that the stretcher is walking behind the army, and will not step on landmines; when the plane comes, everyone must listen to the command and hide, so don't be afraid, this task is to fight against the enemy in northern Henan, but not to cross the Yellow River, the troops have food to eat, and they will definitely let you have food to eat, and they will definitely let you go home when the time comes. After they understand the situation, their fear and worry disappear. In addition, in terms of mass discipline, marching accommodation, etc., they are all earnestly told what to pay attention to. Then let them hold a meeting to discuss, and mobilize activists to take the lead in speaking, such as asking what to do if someone violates discipline, everyone said that they should hold a meeting to reason and conduct education, etc., and also discussed other issues, and the laborers had a further understanding of how to complete the task. Second, care and take care of the laborers' lives: Form five stretchers into a catering unit, and let them find a special person to be responsible for the food, adjust the life, and eat meat once every three days, and be responsible for finding houses for them for marching and accommodation, and pay attention to caring for and comforting those who are sick and let doctors diagnose and treat them. Care about them in combat situations, help dig good hidden fortifications, so soldiers and laborers established a close friendship. Third, guide the laborers to carry out meritorious service competitions: The leaders of the troops stated that those who complete the task well will be given credit, and the local cadres who lead the stretchers also made arrangements to everyone at the same time, and they will still declare this meritorious service and evaluation after returning home, and those who violate discipline and run away will be severely punished, explaining the glory of completing the task well. This mobilization for meritorious service is well reflected in the actions of the laborers. A detachment proposed: "Guarantee to complete the task", and the second detachment also proposed: "Wherever the army goes, we will follow, and guarantee to complete the task." Fourth, timely commendation and timely explanation: Every time we depart from one place, check the mass discipline once, and find that the leadership adopts a five-minute speech method to commend those who are good and those who have completed the task well in peacetime. For individual laborers who do not abide by discipline, unfold discussions among the laborers and conduct criticism. Explain at any time during tense battles. During the Jixian battle, it was found that some laborers were terrified, and immediately told them the situation: "Our army has surrounded the enemy and is attacking the city. As long as everyone listens to the command, they will not suffer losses." After they understood the situation, they overcame their fear. The Zongzheng's notice finally pointed out: According to today's combat situation, laborers may cooperate in every battle. The experience of the "Qingdao" unit should be considered relatively successful, and all units should learn from it, and enrich this aspect of experience in their work.

　　关心民工食宿疾病随时讲明敌情任务
    “青岛”部带领民工取得经验
    【本报讯】华北野战军“黄河”部“青岛”部队，去年秋季攻势中，创造了带领民工的经验。该部纵队政治部特发出通报，号召全军学习。“青岛”部接受冀鲁豫担架两批共一百一十付（卫南县五十付，长垣县六十付）内民工六百六十人，先后经过汲县、新乡外围战役，历时月余，不但民工无一逃亡，并且高度发挥了民工们参战的积极性。打汲县时全体民工在极冷的天气中脱了衣服淌水，却没有一个人说句怨言，并说“不完成打汲县的任务坚决不回家。”一日，天下小雨，民工们怕淋湿了担架上所抬的炮弹，便把棉袍脱下来盖在炮弹上，自己甘心受冷。抬伤员都是轻抬轻放。在月余新区作战中，民工和部队一样的保持了良好的群众纪律，每次战役中皆能帮助部队顺利地完成任务。该部与民工的关系上所以获得如此成绩，主要有以下几点经验：第一、积极进行各种教育：首先根据民工们怕上前线抢彩旗和怕飞机、怕大炮、怕踏着地雷、怕过黄河、怕饿肚子等顾虑，进行解除恐惧的思想教育，开了全体民工大会，从目前形势说起奠定胜利信心，并进一步使他们认识军队打仗是为谁，抬担架又是为了谁？抬担架不是为军队出差，军队是为老百姓，也就是为了给大家服务造幸福才打仗。然后解释担架是走在军队后头的，不会踏上地雷；飞机来了大家要好好听指挥，隐蔽起来就不怕，这次的任务是与豫北敌人作战，不过黄河，部队有饭吃，也一定叫你们有饭吃，到期定让你们回家等。使他们了解情况后，骇怕顾虑思想也就消失了。此外在群众纪律、行军住宿等各方面，均谆谆告以应注意之处。接着就使其开会讨论，发动积极分子带头发言，如提出有人违犯纪律怎么办，大家就说要开会讲道理进行教育等，对其他问题也做了讨论，民工们便对如何完成任务的问题有了进一步的了解。第二、关心与照顾民工的生活：将五付担架组成一个伙食单位，由他们找出专人负责伙食，调剂生活，做到三天吃一顿肉，行军住宿负责给他们能找房子，对有疾病的注意照顾慰问并让医生去诊治。在战斗情况下关心他们，帮助挖好隐蔽工事，由此战士与民工们便建立了亲热的交情。第三、引导民工开展立功竞赛：部队领导上声明完成任务好的要立功，带担架的地方干部也同时向大家布置，回家后仍要声明此次立功评功，犯纪律与开小差的要受严重处罚，说明好好完成任务的光荣，这种立功的动员，很好的便在民工的行动中表现出来。一分队提出：“保证完成任务”，二分队也提出：“军队走到哪里，我们跟到哪里，保证完成任务。”第四、及时表扬，及时解释：每从一地出发，检查一次群众纪律，发现好的及平时完成任务漂亮的领导上就采取五分钟讲话方式，进行表扬。对个别不守纪律的民工，在民工中展开讨论，进行批评。在战斗紧张时要随时解释。汲县战斗时，发现有些民工骇怕，随即告他们情况：“我们军队已经把敌人围住了，正在攻城，只要大家听指挥保证不会受损失。”他们了解情况后便克服了骇怕心理。纵政之通报中最后指出：根据今天作战情况，每战皆可能有民工配合。“青岛”部的经验应该被认为是比较成功的，各部皆应学习，并更加在工作中丰富这方面的经验才好。
