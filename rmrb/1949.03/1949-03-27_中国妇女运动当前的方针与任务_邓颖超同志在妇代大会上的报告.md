Comrade Deng Yingchao's report on "The Current Policy and Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement" at the Women's Congress: She first narrated that since the May Fourth Movement, throughout the various revolutionary periods of the People's Liberation War, Chinese women stood together with the Chinese people, persisting in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Large numbers of Chinese working women and revolutionary intellectual women devoted themselves to the great struggle for national independence, democratic freedom, and the liberation of women themselves. She cited many examples to illustrate the heroic sacrifices and arduous struggles of revolutionary Chinese women, and provided numerous statistics and vivid examples to illustrate the immense contributions of working women in the liberated areas in supporting the People's Liberation War, the land reform movement, and the production movement. She pointed out that in the liberated areas, especially in areas where land reform had been completed, the status of women had undergone and was undergoing fundamental changes. They had transformed from a position of humiliation as slaves to become masters of the new society, paving the way for the complete liberation of women. She also listed many facts to illustrate that the broad masses of women oppressed in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were living an inhuman life of enslavement, suffering insults from the US imperialist troops stationed in China, and persecution by the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. She indignantly proposed that our First National Congress of Chinese Women lodge a serious protest to the US imperialists, drive the forces of US imperialism out of China, and avenge our sisters who were persecuted in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. She said that the different status and lives of women in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas clearly illustrate that only by responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party, only by relying on their own hard work and struggle, and only in a society without oppression, under the guarantee of a democratic government, can women obtain freedom and liberation. At this point, she put forward that the general task of Chinese women today is to carry the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to the end, completely eliminate the Kuomintang's reactionary forces, complete the New Democratic Revolution, and build a unified people's democratic republic. She said that Chinese women must closely unite with the Chinese people, support the eight peace terms of Chairman Mao Zedong of the CPC, and strive for their complete realization.

	Next, she emphasized that urban women's work has become a new and important issue currently. Without neglecting rural women's work, urban women's work should be the focus. Its task is mainly to mobilize and organize women to participate in various production undertakings suitable for urban economic construction. The working target should be primarily female workers of the advanced class, uniting other working women and female intellectuals, and carrying out work among women in all strata of society. In cities that have been liberated for a longer time and where work has a preliminary foundation, further efforts should be made to improve women's cultural level around production and construction, so that they can actively participate in democratic construction, exercise women's democratic rights, gradually remove the special feudal ideas and traditional customs that bind women, and develop women and children's welfare undertakings. Regarding rural women's work in the liberated areas, she said that we support the "Decision on the Current Work of Rural Women in the Liberated Areas" issued by the Central Committee of the CPC last December, which put forward the guiding principles and tasks. She separately and in detail elaborated on the various organizational forms and working methods for mobilizing urban and rural women to engage in production.

	After explaining the guiding principles and tasks of the women's movement in the liberated areas, she said: We enthusiastically support the revolutionary struggle of women forced in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

	She suggested to the congress the establishment of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to unify and strengthen the leadership of the women's movement and to mobilize the masses of women more widely to expand the democratic women's movement. She also proposed that in order to meet the needs of the victorious development of the revolution, a large number of female cadres must be cultivated and promoted. And she called on female cadres to strengthen their studies and improve themselves.

	Finally, she proposed that in the future, we should further strengthen contact with the international democratic women's movement, especially to strengthen the unity with Asian women, and strive to guarantee lasting world peace.

　　中国妇女运动当前的方针与任务
    邓颖超同志在妇代大会上的报告
    邓颖超同志在妇代大会上关于“中国妇女运动当前的方针任务”的报告：她首先叙述自“五四”运动以来，直到人民解放战争的各个革命时期中中国妇女和中国人民在一起，坚持了反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党反动统治的斗争，中国的劳动妇女和革命知识妇女大批的投入为民族独立，为民主自由，为妇女自身解放的伟大的斗争，她举出许多例子，说明革命的中国妇女所作的英勇牺牲和艰苦奋斗的伟绩，举出了许多统计数目字和生动的例子，说明解放区的劳动妇女在支援人民解放战争，土地改革运动和生产运动中的巨大贡献。她指出：在解放区特别是在土地改革已经完成的地区，妇女地位已经起着和正在起着根本的变化，她们已经从奴隶的屈辱地位，变成了新社会的主人，这个变化开辟了妇女完全解放的道路。她又列举了许多事实说明在国民党统治区被压迫的广大妇女群众正在过着被奴役的非人生活，受着美帝国主义驻华军队的侮辱，受着国民党反动统治的迫害。她激愤的提议：我们中国妇女第一次全国代表大会要向美帝国主义者提出严重抗议，把美帝国主义的侵略势力赶出中国去，要为国民党统治区受迫害的姊妹复仇。她说：解放区和国民党统治区妇女不同地位和不同生活很明显的说明：妇女群众只有响应中国共产党的号召，只有依靠自己的努力奋斗，只有在没有压迫的社会里，在民主政府保障之下，才能得到自由和解放。至此她提出：中国妇女当前的总任务是：把反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的斗争进行到底，完全肃清国民党反动势力，完成新民主主义革命，建设统一的人民民主共和国。她说：中国妇女要紧密地和中国人民在一起，拥护中共毛泽东主席的八项和平条件。并为其完全实现而奋斗。
    接着，她强调指出城市妇女工作已成为当前新的重要课题。在不忽视乡村妇女工作的条件之下，应该以城市妇女工作为重心。其工作任务主要是发动和组织妇女参加适合于城市经济建设的各种生产事业。工作对象应以先进阶级的女工为主，团结其他劳动妇女与女知识分子，并在各阶层妇女中进行工作。在解放较久，工作已有初步基础的城市，应更进一步围绕生产建设，提高妇女文化水平，使之积极地参加民主建设，运用妇女的民主权利，逐渐解除束缚妇女的特殊封建思想和传统习俗，并开展妇女儿童福利事业。对于解放区农村妇女工作，她说，我们拥护去年十二月中共中央发布的“关于目前解放区农村妇女工作的决定”所提出的方针任务。她分别地详细地阐述了发动城市妇女和农村妇女进行生产的各种组织形式和工作方法。
    在说明了解放区妇女运动的方针任务之后，她说道：我们热情地支援国民党统治区被迫妇女的革命斗争。
    她向大会建议成立中华全国民主妇女联合会，以统一与加强妇女运动的领导，更广泛地动员妇女群众扩大民主妇女运动。她又提出：为适应革命胜利发展的需要，必须大量培养与提拔妇女干部。并号召女干部加强学习，提高自己。
    最后，她提出今后要更加强与国际民主妇女运动的联系，特别是要加强和亚洲妇女的团结，为保障世界的持久和平而奋斗。
