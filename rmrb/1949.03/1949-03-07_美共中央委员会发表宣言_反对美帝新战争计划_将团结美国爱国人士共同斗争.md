　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to Agence France-Presse, New York: The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Foster, and General Secretary Dennis, issued a declaration on March 2, stating: We communists will, together with millions of American patriots, jointly oppose those who attempt to provoke a new world war. We will work with all who seek peace, democracy, and social progress. The declaration also stated: If Wall Street succeeds in plunging the world into war, then we will do everything we can to oppose it, because it is an unjust war of aggressive imperialism, it is an anti-democratic and anti-socialist war, and it is a war that undermines the greatest interests of the American people and all mankind. The declaration pointed out: It is precisely our military and the British military that have established a general headquarters in Fontainebleau (southeast of Paris). It is not the Soviet Union, but the United States that has military bases and is interfering in the internal affairs of China, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Canada, Greenland, Brazil, and countries such as France and Italy. The declaration believes that the recent statements by French Communist Party leader Thorez and Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti are a contribution to the cause of peace. The national sovereignty and independence of France and Italy are now completely threatened by Wall Street's plan to dominate the world, which is manifested in the Marshall Plan and the proposed North Atlantic Military Alliance.

　　美共中央委员会发表宣言
    反对美帝新战争计划
    将团结美国爱国人士共同斗争
    【新华社陕北五日电】据法新社纽约讯：美国共产党中央委员会主席福斯特及总书记但尼斯于三月二日发表宣言称：我们共产党人，将与千百万美国爱国人士一起，共同反对那些企图引起新的世界战争的人们。我们将与一切追求和平、民主及社会进步的人们共同工作。宣言又称：如果华尔街做到了把世界投入战争，那么，我们将全力反对它，因为它是一个非正义的侵略的帝国主义战争，它是一个反民主的反社会主义的战争，是破坏美国人民与全人类最大利益的战争。宣言指出：恰恰就是我们的军部及英国的军部，在枫丹白露（在巴黎东南）建立了总司令部。不是苏联，而是美国有着军事基地，并正在干涉中国、希腊、土耳其、伊朗、加拿大、格陵兰、巴西及法意等国的内政。宣言认为：法共领袖多列士与意共领袖托格里亚蒂最近的声明，对和平事业具有贡献。法意两国的国家主权与独立，今天已经完全为华尔街的独霸世界的计划所威胁，这一计划表现于马歇尔计划与建议中的北大西洋军事联盟中。
