　　New Sewing Machine
  　Rotates 2,500 Times Per Minute
    【TASS Moscow, 7th】 A special showroom exhibiting the latest achievements in Soviet sewing technology has opened at the Soviet Sewing Industry Scientific Research Institute. Soviet factories have already created new sewing machines that can rotate more than 2,500 times per minute. A valuable new invention is the new "conveyor," which allows for the simultaneous manufacture of various styles of clothing. One such "conveyor" is being tested at the "Bolshevichka" sewing factory in Moscow, with good results. On display are various sewing tools that can increase production and improve the quality of goods several times over. More than 17,000 such tools have already been distributed to sewing factories in cities across the country. Various manual work procedures that were previously done by hand are now being replaced by new Soviet-made sewing machines.

　　新型缝纫机
  　每分钟回转二千五百次
    【塔斯社莫斯科七日电】展览苏联缝纫技术最新成就的特别陈列室已在苏联缝纫业科学研究所开幕。苏联工厂已经造出新型缝纫机，每分钟能回转二千五百余次。有一种宝贵的新发明，就是新式“运送机”，有了它就能同时制造各种式样的衣服。有一台这种“运送机”在莫斯科“布尔什维契卡”缝纫工厂实验，结果良好。有一个展览台上陈列着各种不同的缝纫用具，可以增加生产量并改进货物的品质若干倍。这样用具一万七千余件已经分送全国各城市缝纫工厂使用。前此以手工作的各种工作手续，现在都以苏联造的新式缝纫机代替了。
