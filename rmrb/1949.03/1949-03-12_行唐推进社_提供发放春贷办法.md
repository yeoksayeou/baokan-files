　　Xingtang Promotion Agency
  　Provides Spring Loan Methods
    [Our Dispatch] In order to help with land preparation for spring plowing and to make early preparations for spring plowing, the Xingtang Promotion Agency convened a meeting of office directors on the 23rd of this month. The meeting lasted three days, during which a thorough review of agricultural loan work was conducted, and specific plans were made for agricultural loans in preparation for spring plowing:
    1. Water conservancy loans are mainly intended to increase the number of new waterwheels and wells, and to assist in repairing old waterwells and waterwheels. Thirty-five waterwheels have already been transported back, and more than 20,000 buckets have been prepared. The brick kilns supported by the Promotion Agency have produced 105,000 bricks, which will be supplied to the masses for large-scale development of water conservancy. 2. Regarding fertilizer, over 50,000 jin of oil cake have been prepared, and will be loaned to farmers who want to invest but lack the resources at a slightly lower price than the market price before spring plowing. In addition, more than 3,500 jin of bone fertilizer will also be sold on credit. 3. For seeds, the general seeds mainly rely on mutual adjustment and exchange among the masses. In order to complete the county's requirement of planting 70,000 mu of cotton, the Promotion Agency has transported back more than 30,000 jin of cotton seeds from the county and more than 10,000 jin of local cotton seeds, and plans to purchase another 5,000 jin of cotton seeds from central Hebei to solve the seed difficulties of the masses. In order to greatly promote the planting of peanuts, a portion of agricultural loans will be used as peanut loan grain. 4. In order to stimulate the masses to add livestock for spring plowing, a portion of livestock loan grain will be loaned to the masses. 5. Detailed research was conducted on the loan issuance methods. In order to overcome the phenomenon of loans not being used for their intended purpose, cadres are required to go deep into the grassroots, understand the situation, and obtain evaluations from village cadres and introductions from village cooperative directors or agricultural loan committee members, as well as find guarantors to ensure that the loan grain is used for production and to conduct timely inspections. In order to prevent the loan grain from being used for other purposes, most of the loans are issued in kind (such as waterwheels, fertilizers, etc.) calculated in terms of rice. The "loan grain check" method will be tried for livestock loan grain. The office will first issue agricultural loan printed grain coupons, and after the livestock is purchased, the livestock transaction certificate can be used to exchange for grain at the office. If it is found that the loan is not used for its intended purpose, it should be resolutely recovered immediately and appropriately punished. 6. Clear provisions were also made for the loan recipients and the types of loans. Loans must be given to genuine laborers who want to invest but lack the resources. Loans will be resolutely denied to idlers. Specifically, priority is given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and newly emancipated farmers, followed by landlords and rich peasants who lack the means of production. It is also proposed that agricultural loan work should be carried out along with the production season. The steps involved are to combine production, collect old loans, and issue new loans, so as to achieve a continuous flow and benefit the masses' production.

　　行唐推进社
  　提供发放春贷办法
    【本报讯】为帮整地进行春耕，提早作好春耕准备工作，行唐推进社于本月二十三日召开办事处主任会议，历时三天，对农贷工作进行了深刻检讨，与针对春耕做好农贷，作了具体计划：
    一、水利贷粮主要是为增加新水车水井及助修旧水井水车。现在已运回水车卅五架，准备斗子二万多个，推进社扶助之砖窑已出砖十万五千个，将供给群众使用，大量发展水利。二、肥料上，油饼已准备出五万余斤，春耕前将稍低市价出贷给想下本而无力之农民，另外有骨肥三千五百余斤亦进行贷卖。三、籽种，一般籽种主要依靠群众互调互换，为完成全县种棉七万亩之要求，推进社已从县运回棉籽三万余斤，本地棉籽一万余斤，并计划再从冀中购弄棉籽五千斤，解决群众籽种困难。为大量提倡种花生，抽一部农贷作为花生贷粮。四、为刺激群众大量添牲口进行春耕，抽一部牲口贷粮贷给群众。五、在出贷办法上进行了详细研究，为克服贷非所用现象发生，要求干部深入下层，了解情况，经村干部评定及村社主任或农贷委员介绍，并找保证人，保证其贷粮用于生产，并进行及时检查，为防止贷粮他用，大部分系以实物出贷（如水车、肥料等）折米计算。牲口贷粮试行“贷粮支票”办法由办事处先发给之农贷印制粮条，俟其买到牲口后，即可持牲口交易证，到办事处凭条支粮，如发现贷非所用者，应即坚决追回。并酌情予以处分。六、出贷对象及出贷种类亦作了明确规定，一定贷给真正劳动人民想下本而资力缺乏者，二流于懒汉坚决农贷，具体进行中是先烈军工属及新翻身农民，而后是缺乏生产资料之地主富农，并提出农贷工作应随同生产季节去作，在进行步骤上是结合生产，催收旧贷出放新贷，以达川流不息而利群众生产。
