[Taiyuan Frontline Electric Dispatch] "Peacetime training should be as realistic as actual combat; when fighting, it should be as familiar as peacetime." This is the current goal that all officers and soldiers of a certain regiment are striving for. Since the operations on the outskirts of Taiyuan, the regiment's military training has been conducted under the slogan of "Fight what kind of battle, train for what kind of battle." Based on the tasks assigned to them, they set up various fortifications similar to those built by the Yan bandit forces in Taiyuan and conducted repeated drills. When instructing on each subject, they first held an educational preparation meeting to raise the problems that might be encountered in the course of combat development, study various handling methods, and then conduct exercises, continuously supplementing and revising them during the exercises, and finally make a summary. This kind of educational preparation meeting is actually a kind of combat preparation meeting, and these exercises have become some exercises that seem to have the nature of actual combat. As a result of carrying out military training in accordance with this spirit, the unit's skills have been greatly improved, and the individual and group actions of the soldiers have also been quite proficient. The remaining problem is how to further improve the tactical thinking level and on-the-spot command ability of the cadres on the existing basis. In this regard, under the leadership of higher authorities, the regiment conducted universal tactical education among the cadres. In addition to the regiment and battalion cadres participating in the tactical meetings convened by the higher authorities, two training courses were also held to specifically conduct tactical education for company and platoon cadres. In the education, a method combining the explanation of principles and actual combat review was adopted to study which places in the past battles were in line with tactical principles and which places were not. At the same time, sand table exercises and live-fire command exercises were carried out to compare them with tactical principles. This kind of mass, systematic tactical education under the guidance of theory is of great significance to cadre education. In past battles, some cadres emphasized bravery and only paid attention to leading assault teams to charge fiercely, while they did not pay enough attention to thinking of more ways, which resulted in some unnecessary casualties in each battle. After the study, the cadres not only began to understand or accept certain tactical principles, but more importantly, they strengthened their tactical concepts and further understood the importance of paying attention to tactics and closely combining tactics with teaching. Some cadres said: "It would have been great if we had studied like this earlier."

　　克服一味猛冲猛打
    加强战士战术观点
    太原前线某团热烈练兵
    【太原前线电】“平时练兵，要象直正打仗那样逼真；打起仗来，又要象平时那样熟练。”这是某团全体指战人员目前正在努力的目标。太原外围作战以来，该团练兵就是在“打什么仗，练什么兵”的口号之下进行的。根据自己受领的任务，设置了类似阎匪在太原设防的各种工事，进行反复演习。在教练每个课目时，先召开一次教育准备会，把战斗发展过程中可能遇到的问题提出来，研究出各种处置办法，然后实施演习，并在演习过程中不断加以补充修正，最后做出总结。这种教育准备会实际上就是一种作战准备会，这些演习也就成了一些似乎实战性质的演习。根据这种精神进行练兵的结果，部队技术已有很大提高，战士的单个与小组动作也已相当熟练，剩下的问题就是在现有基础上如何更进一步提高干部的战术思想水平与实地指挥能力。在这一方面，该团在上级领导下，在干部中进行了普遍的战术教育。除团营干部参加了上级召开的战术会议外，并举办了两期训练班，专门进行连排干部的战术教育。在教育中采取讲解原则与实战检讨相结合的方法，研究过去战斗那些地方是合乎战术原则的，那些地方是不合乎战术原则的。同时并进行沙盘作业与实兵指挥的演习，使之与战术原则相对照。这种在理论指导之下群众性的比较系统的战术教育，对干部教育意义很大。在过去战斗中，一部分干部是着重了勇敢，只注意带领突击队猛冲，而对于如何多想办法，则注意不够，因而使部队在每次战斗中总是有些不应有的伤亡。经过学习后，干部们不但开始懂得或接受了某些战术原则，而更重要的是加强了战术观念，更加了解了讲究战术与战教紧密结合的重要。有些干部说：“要是早这样学习就好了。”
