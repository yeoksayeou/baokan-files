Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 5th (delayed): The North China People's Government's Cultural and Art Work Committee and the North China Literary and Art Circles Association held a tea party for literary and art circles at the Beijing Hotel at 1:00 PM on the 3rd. They welcomed literary and art figures who had newly arrived in Beiping from various places and those who had originally stayed in Beiping. Those invited to attend included Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Xu Guangping, Xu Beihong, Yu Pingbo, Cao Jinghua, Feng Zhi, Ma Xulun, Jiao Juyin, Li Guangtian, Lu Zhiwei, Feng Fengzi, Sheng Jialun, Li Hua, Lao Zhicheng, Ge Yihong, An E, Xia Kangnong, Zhou Jianren, Cheng Yanqiu, Dai Ailian, Ye Qianyu, Peng Zigang, Xiao Xiangrong, Liu Baiyu, Ai Qing, Ma Yanxiang, Zhang Zhixiang, Huangmei, Li Bozhao, Guang Weiran, Song Zhidi, Zhao Yimin, Yuan Bo, Cai Ruohong and others, totaling more than seventy people.

After a brief introduction by Sha Kofu, Deputy Director of the North China Cultural and Art Work Committee, Zhou Yang, Director of the North China Cultural and Art Work Committee, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the North China People's Government Cultural and Art Work Committee and the North China Literary and Art Circles Association. Zhou Yang said: China's progressive revolutionary literature and art have made brilliant contributions to the modern Chinese people's revolutionary movement. The progressive forces in literary and art circles were long divided by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, thanks to the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the two forces in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and in the liberated areas have converged. For more than twenty years, the Kuomintang government adopted extremely barbaric and cruel policies to strangle all progressive literature and art, but progressive revolutionary literary and art workers have consistently and unyieldingly persisted in the struggle. Their struggle gave the people in the liberated areas significant spiritual encouragement. Zhou Yang then briefly introduced the situation and experience of literary and art work in the liberated areas. He pointed out that new themes have emerged in the literary and art works of the liberated areas, namely the People's Liberation War, land reform, and production and construction. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have gained the status of true masters in these works. This is completely reasonable, because it is the people, primarily the working class and peasantry, who create history and create revolutionary miracles. Literary and art workers must learn to reflect and represent them. Therefore, they must learn to fully understand the language and emotions of the working class and peasantry. Only in this way can they become their loyal and competent spokespersons. Literary and art workers in the liberated areas have encountered painful tests and serious problems of ideological transformation in the process of integrating with the working class and peasantry. In this process, they have received the most valuable assistance from Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Now, the literary and art workers, readers, and audiences in the liberated areas have a completely new relationship: they learn from the masses on the one hand and educate the masses on the other. Therefore, literary and art work has become a very responsible job. To combine literature and art with the masses, it is not enough to rely solely on professional literary and art workers; it is also necessary to mobilize the masses of workers and peasants to create their own works. Mass literature and art in the liberated areas is very active. Notable examples include rural theater troupes, factory literature and art, and gun-barrel poetry. In the liberated areas, literature and art consciously serve politics and reflect politics. Literature and art that claims to be apolitical does not exist. Literary and art workers must be familiar with the lives of the masses and must also understand the various policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government; the two cannot be separated. Zhou Yang pointed out that literature and art in the liberated areas still have many shortcomings, but it has rich content, strong vitality, and a great future. He hoped that literary and art circles would unite closely, fight together against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to build a new China, and strive together to establish the cause of new Chinese literature and art.

Writer Mao Dun then spoke. He said: To combine with the working class, peasantry, and soldiers, one can achieve the goal as long as one learns more from the people and transforms oneself. He mentioned that in the current victorious situation, all major cities across the country will be liberated one by one. In these large cities, attention should be paid to opposing the anesthetizing yellow literature and art that the reactionary rulers used to cater to the tastes of the petty bourgeoisie.

Playwright Tian Han called on literary and art workers to study and re-educate themselves. At the same time, he proposed that literary and art circles should re-form a unified national organization under the same goal, so that they can work more smoothly and powerfully, and better serve the people.

Writer Guo Moruo enthusiastically described his yearning for Yan'an. He called the liberators of literature and art "angels of light." Guo Moruo pointed out that after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, Chinese literature and art entered a new era. Chinese literature and art since the May Fourth Movement have had an excellent tradition. Although the degree of understanding of most literary and art workers is different, the pursuit of light is a common and excellent quality. He said that Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art was like adding the finishing touch to a dragon painting, lighting a torch for the literary and art circles who had been groping in the dark since the May Fourth Movement. The literary and art workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas had their hands and feet shackled with thousands of shackles. Now that they have come to the liberated areas, they feel happy from the bottom of their hearts. Their hands and feet are free, and they can move forward along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao. He hoped that literary and art workers would plant Mao Zedong's banner along with military development in the Yangtze River Basin and throughout China. Mr. Guo finally pointed out that literary and art workers are engineers of the soul, creating new souls and new human beings for New China. In future construction work, literary and art workers have a great mission and have the task of influencing the spirit and soul of others, but to influence the souls of others, one must first improve one's own soul, establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and study Mao Zedong Thought.

Playwright Hong Shen, with his thirty years of experience in theater and education, humbly expressed that he would start re-learning from now on. He said that he is studying the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, especially the land reform policy. He is studying the textbooks of the liberated areas. He said that he wants to understand from the textbooks of the liberated areas what kind of personality they hope to create for the citizens of New China, and thus create what kind of personality on the stage. He finally expressed his willingness to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party 100% without reservation in his ideology, and contribute his skills unreservedly in his business.

Writer Xu Guangping said: I feel very happy to come to the liberated areas, but there is one unpleasant thing, that is, Xiao Jun, who was introduced by Lu Xun with the book "August in the Countryside," made many serious mistakes in the Northeast. She believes that Xiao Jun's words and deeds completely violated the spirit of Lu Xun and are not worthy of being called Lu Xun's student. She analyzed that the root cause of Xiao Jun's mistakes was his personal heroism. This incident educated all talented intellectuals.

Painter and President of Beiping Art Academy Xu Beihong believes that Chairman Mao's literary and art policy is a great revolution in the history of art. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that literature and art should serve the working people; he solved the problems that the Chinese literary and art circles had not solved, and gave a correct direction for all future efforts.

Writer Yu Pingbo believes that today we have encountered an unprecedented revolution. To correctly understand this revolution, we must learn not only from books but also from actual life.

Poet Feng Zhi described the liberation of Beiping with excitement, comparing it to the sudden arrival of light. He asked for help from revolutionary literary and art workers from all over the world who came to Beiping.

Writer Cao Jing narrated the crimes of how the Kuomintang reactionaries persecuted revolutionary literature and art, and at the same time used concrete facts to illustrate the Chinese Communist Party's concern and love for literature and art and literary and art workers.

Xiao Xiangrong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, said in his speech: The People's Liberation Army, relying on the help of intellectuals and cultural workers, has made itself a strong and cultural army. In the future, it will need the help of intellectuals even more. He said that when the soldiers saw their stories on the screen or written in the works, they were indescribably happy. The soldiers often said: "Watching a play once is equivalent to taking three months of cultural lessons." Therefore, the People's Liberation Army welcomes literary and art workers to the troops very much.

Finally, Sha Kofu expressed his gratitude to the guests and responded to the proposal to establish a national literary and art organization, hoping to promote its realization as soon as possible.

When the literary and art figures attending the symposium had dinner at six o'clock, General Ye Jianying, Mayor of Beiping, arrived. Amidst warm applause, he celebrated the meeting of the literary and art army and wished the national literary and art organization a smooth birth.

　　华北文艺界在平举行茶话会
    欢迎文艺界人士并交换意见
    解放区文艺作品新的主题
  　是真实表现工农兵
    【新华社北平五日电】（迟到）华北人民政府文化艺术工作委员会和华北文艺界协会于三日下午一时在北京饭店举行文艺界茶话会。欢迎新由各地来平及原来留平的文艺界人士。应邀到会者有郭沫若、茅盾、田汉、洪深、许广平、徐悲鸿、俞平伯、曹靖华、冯至、马叙伦、焦菊隐、李广田、陆志韦、封凤子、盛家伦、李桦、老志诚、葛一虹、安娥、夏康农、周建人、程砚秋、戴爱莲，叶浅予、彭子冈、萧向荣、刘白羽、艾青、马彦祥、张致祥、荒煤、李伯钊、光未然、宋之的、赵毅敏、袁勃、蔡若虹等七十余人。
    在华北文化艺术工作委员会副主任委员沙可夫作简短介绍后，华北文化艺术工作委员会主任委员周扬代表华北人民政府文化艺术工作委员会与华北文艺界协会致欢迎词。周扬说：中国进步的革命的文艺在近代中国人民革命运动史上有过光辉的贡献。文艺界的进步力量，曾长期被国民党反动派所分割。现在由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，在国民党统治区的与在解放区的两股力量汇合起来了。二十多年来，国民党政府对一切进步文艺采取极野蛮残酷的绞杀政策，但进步的革命的文艺工作者却始终一贯，不屈不挠地坚持了斗争。他们的斗争给了解放区人民以重大的精神上的鼓励。周扬接着简单地介绍了解放区文艺工作的情况和经验。他指出解放区文艺作品中涌现了新的主题，即人民解放战争、土地改革和生产建设。工农兵在这些作品中取得了真正主人翁的地位。这是完全合理的，因为创造历史、创造革命奇迹的是人民，首先是工农群众。文艺工作者必须学会反映与表现他们。因此必须学会充分地懂得工农群众的言语与情感，只有如此，才能成为他们的忠实的称职的代言人。解放区的文艺工作者们在与工农群众结合的过程中，曾经遇到痛苦的考验，曾经遇到思想改造的严重问题。在这个过程中，他们得到了中国共产党领袖毛泽东同志的最宝贵的帮助。现在解放区的文艺工作者与读者观众完全是新的关系：一面向人民群众学习，一面又教育人民群众。因此文艺工作成为一种十分负责的工作。要使文艺与人民群众相结合，单靠职业的文艺工作者还不够，还必须发动工农群众自己创作。解放区群众文艺是非常活跃的。较显著的，如农村剧团、工厂文艺、枪杆诗等等。在解放区，文艺是自觉地服从政治、反映政治的，自称为超政治的文艺是不存在的。文艺工作者一方面要熟悉人民群众的生活，一方面必须通晓共产党与人民政府的各种政策，二者是不能分开的。周扬指出解放区文艺还有许多缺点，但它却有丰富的内容、强烈的生命力和伟大的前途。希望文艺界紧紧团结在一起，为反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义，建设新中国而共同斗争，为建立新中国文艺的事业而共同奋斗。
    作家茅盾接着说话。他说：与工农兵相结合，只要多向人民学习，改造自己，有志者是可以达到目的。他谈到在目前胜利形势下，全国大城市都将一一解放，在这些大城市中，应当注意反对反动统治者用以投合小资产阶级趣味的麻醉性的黄色文艺。
    戏剧家田汉号召文艺工作者应该再学习与再教育。同时提议文艺界应在同一目标下，重新结成全国统一的组织，以便更顺利、更有力量地进行工作，更好地为人民服务。
    作家郭沫若热情地叙述他对延安的憧憬。他称解放文艺工作者为光明的天使。郭沫若指出在延安文艺座谈会后，中国文艺进入了一个新的时代。“五四”以来的中国文艺有优良传统，多数文艺工作者认识的程度虽有不同，但追求光明则是共同的优良品质。他说毛主席文艺座谈会上的讲演，就象是画龙点睛地向“五四”以来在黑暗中摸索的文艺界点起了火炬。国民党统治区的文艺工作者手与脚受了千万重手镣与脚铐，现在到解放区来了，从心里感觉到愉快，手足放开了，可以照着毛主席所指的路径向前走了。希望文艺工作者把毛泽东旗帜随军事发展插到长江流域，插遍全中国。郭先生最后指出文艺工作者是灵魂工程师，为新中国创造新灵魂，新人类。在今后建设工作上，文艺工作者负有很大使命，负有影响别人精神与灵魂的任务，但影响别人灵魂首先要健全自己的灵魂，建立革命人生观，学习毛泽东思想。
    戏剧家洪深以三十年从事戏剧工作和教育工作的经验，虚心地表示要从现在开始重新学习。他说他正在研究中国共产党与人民政府的各种政策，特别是土地改革政策。他正在研究解放区的教科书。他说要从解放区的课本中了解希望造成新中国国民的什么人格，从而在舞台上也造成什么人格。他最后表示愿意在思想上百分之百毫无保留地接受中国共产党的领导，在业务上不折不扣毫无保留地贡献自己的技术。
    作家许广平说：来到解放区感到非常愉快，但有一件不愉快的事，即曾以“八月的乡村”一书受鲁迅介绍的萧军，在东北犯了许多严重的错误。她认为萧军的言行完全违背鲁迅的精神，根本不配称为鲁迅的一生。她分析萧军犯错误的根源是他的个人英雄主义。这件事教育了一切才子式的知识分子。
    画家和北平艺术学院院长徐悲鸿认为毛主席的文艺政策是艺术史上的大革命。毛主席明确地指出文艺应为劳动人民服务；解决了中国文艺界没有解决过的问题，使今后一切的努力有了正确的方向。
    作家俞平伯认为今天碰到了千古未有的革命。要正确理解这个革命，不但从书本上而且更要从实际生活中去学习。
    诗人冯至以兴奋的心情描述北平的解放，比拟做光明的突然降临。他要求得到各地来平的革命文艺工作者的帮助。
    作家曹靖叙述了国民党反动派如何迫害革命文艺的罪恶，同时又用具体事实说明了中国共产党对文艺及文艺工作者的关怀与爱护。
    东北人民解放军政治部宣传部长萧向荣在发言中说：人民解放军依靠知识分子与文化工作者的帮助，使自己成了强有力的有文化的军队。今后更需要知识分子的帮助。他说，当战士们看到他们的故事上了镜头或者写到作品中，他们是高兴得难以形容。战士们常说：“看了一次戏等于上了三个月的文化课。”因此，人民解放军非常欢迎文艺工作者到部队中去。
    最后，由沙可夫向来宾表示谢意，并响应成立全国文艺界组织的建议，愿早日促其实现。
    当参加座谈会的文艺界人士在六点钟聚餐时，北平市市长叶剑英将军赶到了。他在热烈的掌声中，庆祝文艺大军会合，预祝全国文艺界组织很顺利的产生。
