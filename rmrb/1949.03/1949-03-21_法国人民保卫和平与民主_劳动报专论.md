Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th: Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: The Labor News published a special article on the 16th entitled "French People Defend Peace and Democracy," stating: Hundreds of thousands of Parisian French men and women recently marched on the streets of the French capital, holding up placards declaring that the French working people remember the lessons of the past and will never allow anyone to repeat them. This grand demonstration was held on the fifteenth anniversary of the February events of 1934. In February 1934, the reactionaries prepared to seize power and rapidly plotted a coup. However, the powerful movement of the working class controlled these conspiracies, and they put forward the slogan of the fighting unity of democratic forces. Under the rampant aggression of Hitler and the German army, the reactionaries won a temporary victory in France. The treacherous and country-selling Pétain "Marshal" became the head of France. The current situation is in some respects similar to that of 1934. At that time, the symbol of reaction was Pétain; now, it is De Gaulle. The ruling Socialist Party and Catholic factions respectfully promote De Gaulle. His policy of non-aggression, befriending German imperialism, and the Munich policy of rebellion and anti-Sovietism, are continued in the policies of the Western bloc and the North Atlantic Alliance, and in the policy of turning France into a beachhead for American imperialist expansion. However, today's France is fundamentally different from before, because the French working class shouldered the entire burden of the resistance movement during the enemy occupation, and its prestige and influence have been greatly enhanced. This is actively manifested in the growth and strengthening of the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor. Democratic movements in all aspects of France are thriving, and the national progressive forces are uniting around the Communist Party.
    The French Communist Party's firm statement, which the French people are convinced will never fight the Soviet Union, has been echoed around the world. This statement has particularly disturbed the reactionary politicians, from the Gaullists to the Socialists, because the broadest masses have expressed their support for the Communist Party's struggle to defend peace. The French Communist Party's brave declaration of defending peace and opposing military adventures has been echoed by millions of working people in various countries. The International Liaison Committee of Intellectuals issued a declaration in Paris on February 24, calling for the defense of peace. This call has received a widespread response in France, with enthusiastic support from the General Confederation of Labor, the Youth League, democratic women's organizations, the Republican Veterans Association, as well as many famous figures in the scientific, artistic, and cultural fields.
    Many things have happened in France in the last fifteen years, resulting in definite changes. The political experience of the French people has been incomparably enhanced, and they are able to clearly distinguish between friends and enemies. The British and American warmongers, with the help of Blum and Moch, are calculating to turn the French people into tools for realizing Wall Street's aggressive plans. They will have to deal with such a people.

　　法国人民保卫和平与民主
    劳动报专论
    【新华社陕北二十日电】新华社莫斯科讯：劳动报十六日发表题为“法国人民保卫和平与民主”的专文称：数十万巴黎法国男女新近在法国首都街上游行，高举标语牌宣称法国劳动人民记得已往的教训，决不容许任何人重复。这次盛大的示威是在一九三四年二月事件十五周年纪念日举行的。在一九三四年二月，反动派准备夺取政权，急速地策划政变。但工人阶级强有力的运动控制了这些阴谋，他们提出了民主力量战斗团结的口号。工人在希特勒和德国军队的张牙舞爪之下，反动派才在法国嬴得了暂时的胜利，背信弃义，叛卖祖国的贝当“元首”才当了法兰西的元首。迫于当前的形势，在某些方面正处一九三四年的情形。在那时候反动的象征是贝当，现在，则是戴高乐。占据统治地位的社会党和天主教派，恭敬地推崇戴高乐。他不侵略、交好德国帝国主义和叛乱反苏的慕尼黑政策，在西方集团和北大西洋联盟的政策中，在把法国变为美帝国主义扩张的鳖头堡垒的政策中、得到了继续。但是，今天的法国已在根本上与从前不同，因为法国工人阶级在敌人占领期间，肩负起了抵抗运动的整个重担，它的威信和影响已经大大提高了。这主动地表现在法国共产党和总工会的成长和壮大。法国各方面的民主运动都蓬蓬勃勃，全国进步力量正团结在共产党的周围。
    法国共产党日前所迷信法国人民决不对苏作战的坚决的声明，得到了全世界的响应。这个声明，特别使反动政客们从戴高乐派直到社会主义派，因为最广大的群众表示了他们支持共产党保卫和平的斗争。法国共产党的保卫和平、反对军事冒险的勇敢宣言，得到各国千百万劳动人民的响应。国际知识分子联络委员会二月二十四日在巴黎发表宣言，号召保卫和平。这一号召在法国得到广泛的响应，如总工会、青年联盟、民主妇女团体、共和国退伍军人协会以及许多科学界、艺术界和文化界许多名人士的热烈拥护。
    最近十五年来，法国已有许多事情发生了确定的变化。法国人民的政治经验已无可比拟地提高了，能够清楚地区别朋友和敌人。英美战争贩子借勃鲁姆和莫许的帮助，盘算把法国人民变成实现华尔街侵略计划的工具，他们就不能不对付这样的人民。
