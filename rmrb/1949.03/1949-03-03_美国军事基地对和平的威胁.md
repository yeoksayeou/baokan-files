Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS dispatch: The latest issue of the Soviet magazine "New Times" published a special article by Yin Zuofu entitled "The Threat to Peace Posed by U.S. Military Bases." The article stated:

The statement issued by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 29 regarding the "North Atlantic Treaty" exposed the aggressive nature of the current U.S. and British foreign policy. The statement pointed out that the establishment of an extensive network of naval and air force bases around the world, including overseas locations thousands of miles away from the United States, is one of the proofs of the U.S.'s aggressive policy. The planning of this base network began to be implemented relentlessly even during the war.

The purpose of establishing the U.S. military base "encirclement" is clearly to surround the countries of the democratic camp. This "encirclement" passes through Greenland, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Italy, Greece, the Middle East and the Far East, Pacific islands, China, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, and finally Alaska.

Judging from newspaper reports, one of the most important U.S. bases is in the United Kingdom. Even British Members of Parliament have bitterly mentioned that the former "Queen of the Seas" will become an "aircraft carrier of the United States in future wars." However, apparently, the desire of the U.S. military to turn the United Kingdom into an "aircraft carrier" has not been opposed by the current British leaders. Moreover, this agreement between Britain and the United States has been officially confirmed. On October 5, 1948, the U.S. Air Force Command in London issued a communiqué, which clearly stated that there were permanent bases for U.S. B-29 Superfortress bombers in the United Kingdom, and that there were 90 such aircraft in the United Kingdom at that time. In order to turn the United Kingdom into a major link in the U.S. base circle, huge preparations are now underway. And the construction of those base circles is for future aggression.

It is also well known that the United States pays great attention to bases in Greenland and Iceland. There are "special" airports there. In Greenland, there are the "Bluie West One" and "Bluie West Eight" airports. In Iceland, there are airports in Keflavik and other places.

For the same aggressive purpose, bases are being built in Alaska.

U.S. war-mongers have also stipulated in a certain strategic plan to establish military bases in Scandinavian countries. Therefore, they are now putting rude pressure on these countries to join the "North Atlantic Treaty." U.S. imperialism especially hopes that Norway will participate, because Norway's territory can be used to build U.S. naval and air force bases close to the doorstep of the Soviet Union. It is quite obvious that the establishment of bases by the United States on foreign territories directly threatens the independence of these countries, especially small countries. The United States is using these bases to occupy various parts of Europe.

U.S. imperialism is sparing no effort to establish bridgeheads for offense in the Mediterranean. Although the U.S. territory is very far from the Mediterranean, U.S. bases are actually being built along the entire Mediterranean coast. Spanish Foreign Minister Artajo has reached an agreement with U.S. Admiral Sherman to transfer some Spanish military bases to the United States. Following Spain is Portugal.

The United Kingdom's so-called defense scope also extends to the Middle East. The United States' de jure recognition of Transjordan and Israel is partly due to interest in bases on the territories of these two countries. The United States is also trying to turn Iran into a strategic bridgehead. According to newspaper reports, the United States has already obtained several military bases in that country; and, in blatant disregard of international law, is increasing its military strength there.

In the Pacific, the United States is also stepping up the construction of military bases.

The above is certainly not a complete list of U.S. bases. It is only a small number of bases known to the public. U.S. imperialism often tries to cover up its expansionist attempts by talking loudly about "peaceful intentions," "aid," "defense," and so on. However, facts are facts. These facts are enough to confirm the aggressive nature of the current U.S. foreign policy and show that it is aimed at anti-Soviet and anti-democratic countries. This is primarily because the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are resolute obstacles to waging war. And this war is being actively prepared by new ambitious people who vainly attempt to dominate the world.

### 美国军事基地对和平的威胁

　　美国军事基地对和平的威胁
    殷佐夫
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社讯：最近一期的苏联“新时代”杂志刊载殷佐夫所作题为“美国军事基地对和平的威胁”的专文，该文内称：
    苏联外交部在一月二十九日发表的对“北大西洋公约”的声明，揭露了美英目前外交政策的侵略的性质。声明指出：在世界各地，包括与美国远隔数千哩的海外地方，建立了广泛的海、空军基地网，就是美国侵略政策的证明之一。这一基地网的计划，还在战争进行时，便被毫不放松地着手实行。
    美国军事基地“大包围圈”之所以建立，其目的显然是要包围民主阵营国家。这一“包围圈”经过格陵兰、冰岛、英国、葡萄牙、西班牙、德国、意大利、希腊、中东与远东、太平洋岛屿、中国、日本、阿留申群岛，以迄阿拉斯加。
    从报纸的报导中判断，美国的最主要基地之一是在英国。甚至英国国会议员也曾在心酸的时候提到过去的“海洋女王”在“未来的战争中将成为美国的航空母舰”。但是，显然，美国军部要将英国变为“航空母舰”的愿望，并未遭到英国当前领导人物的反对。而且，英美的这种协议已获得官方的证实。一九四八年十月五日，美国驻伦敦空军司令部曾发表过一个公报，那个公报很明显地说明：在英国，有美国Ｂ二十九式超级空中堡垒的永久基地，并且，当时在英国即有该式飞机九十架。为了要把英国变成美国基地圈的主要环节，现在正努力进行着巨大的准备工作。而那些基地圈的建筑，是作为未来侵略之用的。
    大家也同样知道，美国对于格陵兰及冰岛的基地，是非常注意的。在那里，有着“特别”的机场。在格陵兰有“蓝西一号”及“蓝西八号”机场。在冰岛的基辅拉维克及其他地方均有机场。
    为着同一的侵略目的，在阿拉斯加正在建筑基地。
    美国战争贩子在某战略计划中，也规定在斯堪的纳维亚国家内建立军事基地。因此，他们现在正对这些国家施以无礼的压力，使其加入“北大西洋公约”。美国帝国主义特别希望挪威参加，因为挪威的领土可以用来建筑紧靠苏联大门口的美国海空军基地。美国在外国领土建立基地，直接威胁这些国家特别是小国家的独立，这是十分显然的。美国正在利用这些基地而盘据欧洲各地。
    美国帝国主义正不遗余力地在地中海建立为进攻之用的桥头堡垒。虽然美国地界和地中海相距甚之，但是美国的基地实际上是沿着整个地中海岸建筑的。在西班牙外长阿塔觉已与美国海军上将苏尔曼导致协议，将西班牙的某些军事基地转给美国。继西班牙之后的是葡萄牙。
    英国的所谓防卫范围同样也扩及中东。美国之在法律上承认外约旦与以色列，在某种程度上是由于对该两国领土上的基地感到兴趣。美国也正在设法把伊朗变为战略桥头阵地。据报纸报导：美国已经在该国获得若干军事基地；而且悍然不顾国际公法，在该地增加军力。
    在太平洋，美国也正在加紧地进行建筑军事基地的工作。
    上面所说的，当然不是美国基地的全部名单。它不过仅仅是为公众所知道的少数基地而已。美国帝国主义经常是用高谈“和平意图”、“援助”、“防卫”等等来极力掩饰它的扩张企图的。但是，事实究竟是事实。这些事实已足够证实美国目前外交政策的侵略性质，并表明它是旨在反苏、反民主国家的。这首先是因为苏联与人民民主国家是进行战争的坚决障碍。而这一战争是新的妄图独霸世界的野心家所积极准备的。
