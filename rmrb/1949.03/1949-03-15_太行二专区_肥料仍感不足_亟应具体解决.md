Taihang Second District

Fertilizer Still Insufficient, Urgent Need for Concrete Solutions

[Taihang Telegram] With the spring plowing season fast approaching, preparing sufficient fertilizer is a concrete guarantee for increasing agricultural production this year. According to investigations in the Second District, fertilizer shortage remains a pressing problem that needs to be resolved. For example, in Hancun, Fourth District of Yushe, a village with relatively good production work, the average fertilizer application per mu is only 25 dan; in Daliang Village, Sixth District of Wuxiang, the average is only 18 dan per mu; and in Tieqiao Village, Sixth District of Heshun, it's only 14 dan. This situation should attract our utmost attention. There is still some time before sowing and fertilizer application, and we should learn from the past lessons of "tight schedules and rushed fertilizer production." We must quickly seize the opportunity, combining fertilizer delivery and processing with fertilizer production.

　　1. Fertilizer Production and Accumulation: Produce and accumulate fertilizer by cutting firewood and scraping turf for fumigation fertilizer, or by digging pit soil, sweeping road soil, using road-padding fertilizer, and collecting manure. There are many past experiences and methods in this regard, but the central key lies in thoroughly mobilizing the masses and conducting concrete organization.

　　2. Fertilizer Processing: The fertilizer accumulated last year, such as compost and stable manure, should be irrigated with water and grass, stirred, and processed to increase the quality of the fertilizer; otherwise, if the time is prolonged, it will not rot well, and the fertilizer efficiency will be reduced.

　　3. Fertilizer Delivery: We must overcome the old habit of the masses of "eating in the first month and sitting in the second month," and strengthen concrete organization and leadership. The manure delivered to the fields should also be covered with soil to prevent odor from spreading.

　　4. Topdressing: As the east wind melts the ice and the wheat seedlings recover, topdressing should be applied at this time, which is an effective way to increase wheat production. Any kind of fertilizer can be used as topdressing, but when it rains, more sesame cake can be used to prevent excessive heat from burning the wheat seedlings.

### 太行二专区　肥料仍感不足  亟应具体解决

　　太行二专区
  　肥料仍感不足  亟应具体解决
    【太行电】春耕时节快到，应准备充足的肥料，是今年农业生产长一寸的具体保证。根据二专区的调查，肥料缺乏，仍是一个急待解决的问题。如榆社四区韩村，是生产工作较好的村子，每亩平均施肥只能上到二十五担；武乡六区大梁村每亩只能平均十八担；和顺六区铁桥村只能上到十四担。这个情况应引起我们十分注意。目前距下种用肥之日，尚有一段时间，应接受以往“时机紧张，再突击造肥”的教训，迅速抓紧时机，结合送肥、整肥，进行造肥。
    一、造肥积肥：割柴草刮草皮薰肥，或打坑土、扫道土，垫道肥、拾粪等进行造肥积肥。在这方面，过去经验及办法很多，中心关键在于深入的发动群众与具体的进行组织。
    二、整肥，去年所积的肥如沤肥、圈肥等，均应灌水灌草，搅拌整理，增加肥的质量；否则，时间拖长就不能很好的腐烂，肥田效力也要减低。
    三、送肥，要克服群众中“吃正月坐二月”的旧习惯，加以具体的组织领导。送到地里的粪，也应用土盖住，防止臭味发散。
    四、追肥，东风解冰，麦苗苏生，在此时间应施追肥，这是麦子增产的有效办法。不管那种肥料都可用作追肥，但有雨水时，可多用麻饼，以防热度过大，烧坏麦苗。
