　　Yellow River Immigrants Build New Villages
  　Rushing to Plant Beans, Trees, and Build Houses
    [Ji Lu Yu Telegram] The Ji Lu Yu Yellow River Disaster Relief and Resettlement Committee, after leading immigrants to establish the Weinanban United New Village, is actively leading immigrants to rush to plant beans, plant trees, and engage in various production and construction activities. The first step is to mobilize the settlers to rush to plant hyacinth beans. There are 180 mu of wasteland on the east and west sides of the new village. Because the terrain is low-lying, wheat was not planted last autumn. On February 1st, when the ground thawed, the Resettlement Committee organized 23 settlers with farm tools and livestock to go to the fields. The next day, all 180 mu of wasteland were sown. In the second half of February, all the settlers in the new village were mobilized to plant a total of more than 2,000 Canadian poplar, locust, willow, hazel, local hazel, and elm trees inside and outside the village. The Resettlement Committee also newly established a nursery to cultivate tree seedlings such as Canadian poplar, arborvitae, and prickly ash for use at any time. In order to expand the cultivated area, the Resettlement Committee sent special personnel to investigate wasteland and discovered another 420 mu of wasteland, which is planned to be reclaimed after research. The Resettlement Committee also led immigrants to build houses in mid-February, and nine tiled houses have been built and construction is still actively underway. In order to solve the difficulties in agricultural reclamation and transporting building materials, the Resettlement Committee also set up a livestock station, which now has eight cattle and three station staff.

　　黄河移民建新村
  　正突击种豆植树盖房屋
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫黄河灾民移垦救济委员会，在领导移民建立了卫南坂联合新村后，又积极领导移民突击种豆栽树及各种生产建设。首先发动垦民突击种扁豆。在新村东西两头共有荒地一顷八十亩，因地势洼，去秋未种上麦子，二月一日，大地解冻，移垦会就组织二十三个垦民带着农具牲口下地，次日，一顷八十亩荒地全部下种。二月下半月内，全新村垦民总动员，在村内外栽上加拿白杨、洋槐、柳树、榛树并本地榛、榆树等共两千余棵。移垦会并新设苗圃，蓄养加拿大白杨、柏子、花椒等树苗，以便随时应用。为扩大耕种面积，移垦会派专人外出调查荒地，又发现荒地四顷二十亩，准备研究后开垦。移垦会并于二月中旬领导移民建房，已盖起瓦房九间，仍在积极建设中。移垦会为解决农垦及拉运建筑材料困难，又设畜力站，现已有牛八头，站员三人。
