　　Support Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia

　　The democratic figures in Beiping, Li Jishen and twelve others, recently issued a statement strongly protesting the barbaric persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya by British imperialists. The statement also protested against the Hong Kong government's closure of Dat Tat College; and protested against the actions of the French and Dutch aggressors in Vietnam and Indonesia and the fascist governments of the Philippines and Siam in persecuting overseas Chinese. We fully support this protest which represents the voice of all patriotic people in China.

　　We demand that all foreign governments currently persecuting overseas Chinese immediately cease this reactionary policy. Overseas Chinese are as close as flesh and blood to the people of mainland China, and their fates are intertwined. Any persecution of overseas Chinese cannot but be considered an unfriendly act towards the Chinese people.

　　We warn the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Kuomintang reactionaries in Southeast Asia: you must immediately stop your reactionary behavior of acting as accomplices in Southeast Asia, otherwise you will be subject to due sanctions by the People's Government.

　　We extend our sincere condolences to all persecuted and deported overseas Chinese. We hope that overseas Chinese at home and abroad will unite as one, uphold justice, and at the same time maintain friendly relations with the people of all ethnic groups in their localities and expand the sympathy of various countries in the world for overseas Chinese. The motherland is being reborn, and the mainstream of the world is progress, not regression. The plight of overseas Chinese is temporary, and the future of overseas Chinese is bright. The unified People's Democratic Republic of China, which will soon be established, will do its best to provide overseas Chinese with all possible assistance.

　　声援南洋华侨
    北平的民主人士李济深等十三人最近发表声明，严重抗议英帝国主义者对于马来亚华侨的野蛮迫害。声明中同时抗议香港政府封闭达德学院；抗议越南、印尼的法荷侵略者和菲律宾、暹罗的法西斯政府迫害华侨的行动。我们完全支持这个代表全中国爱国人民呼声的抗议。
    我们要求一切正在迫害华侨的外国政府立即停止这种反动政策。华侨与中国本土人民情同骨肉，休戚相关，任何对于华侨的迫害，不能不被认为对于中国人民的不友好行为。
    我们警告国民党反动政府和南洋的国民党反动分子，你们必须立即停止在南洋各地为虎作伥的反动行为，否则你们必将受到人民政府的应有的制裁。
    我们对于一切被迫害的和被逐回国的华侨谨致慰问之忱。我们希望海内外华侨团结一致，坚持正义，同时与所在地的任何民族的人民，保持友好态度，扩大世界各国对于华侨的同情。祖国正在新生，世界的主流是进步而不是倒退，华侨的逆境是暂时的，华侨的前途是光明的。不久即将成立的统一的中华人民民主共和国，必将尽力给予华侨以各种可能的援助。
