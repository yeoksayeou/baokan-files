Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 26th. The embankment restoration project on the south bank of the Yellow River in Henan Province has fully commenced. The First Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the various embankment sections along the river, with the assistance of local people, are actively carrying out the embankment restoration project. The entire 156-kilometer embankment line from Chenggao to Simingtang in Kaocheng started work successively in the first half of this month and is now engaged in collecting materials, repairing embankments, and filling in ditches and wave nests. After repairs to the Guangwu-Zhengzhou section, over 15 cubic meters (each cubic meter weighing 3,500 to 4,000 catties) of stone have been thrown at Liu Huning. Over 50 cubic meters of stone have been thrown to repair the dangerous section at Huayuankou. Zhongmu has been completely repaired. The Kaifeng section has also begun to fill in the dam body, embankments, and trenches dug by the bandit troops in the Liuyuankou area. The Chenliu-Lanfeng section has started work separately at Xiaoxin堤, Yangzhuang, Quxingji, and other places to fill and repair ditches and wave nests.

[Ji Lu Yu Electric] Under the leadership of the democratic government, the masses enthusiastically participated in river management. In July of the year before last, the Qin River in Henan breached at Dafan Village, 15 li northwest of Wuzhi, and the entire river changed its course, flooding northeast, resulting in a major disaster. According to incomplete statistics, the worst affected areas include Wuzhi, Xiuwu, Huojia, Huixian, Xinxiang and other five counties, covering an area of ​​400 square kilometers. Within the disaster area, fields were barren and submerged, and hundreds of thousands of people suffered from floods, enduring painful lives for more than two years. During the enemy-occupied period, there was no way to provide relief. Since the liberation of most of the region, in order to urgently rescue and protect the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people, our democratic government has strengthened the Yellow River water conservancy agencies, mobilized and led the masses to carry out the breach closure project. In the initial stage, as soon as the call was issued, countless manpower and materials gathered together. Especially since the collection and purchase began on December 17th of last year until the end of February this year, the enthusiasm of the masses reached its peak. The repair and defense office repeatedly announced the cessation of collection, but the masses continued to enthusiastically send various materials from all directions. Currently, the breach is still 200 meters wide, the water flow is very large, and the Raschig ring head has collapsed by 630 meters. The breach closure project is led by the Fifth Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and the Taihang Fourth Special Commissioner's Office is responsible for the allocation of manpower and materials. The method of closing the breach is to adopt the advancement and confluence method. From February 19th to 28th, the revetment and the earthwork above the low water level and the diversion channel project of the east and west culverts have been started successively. At present, more than 4,000 people are carrying out revetment and earthwork projects every day. With the full enthusiasm of the masses, the diversion channel, which was expected to be completed in half a month, was completed in a blitz within five days. It is also planned to close the gap by the end of March. Everyone participating in the breach closure work has understood for whom and why they are working. In addition, coordinated with the Dafan Village breach closure, there are also famous dangerous works downstream of the breach, such as Wuchekou, Donghongqiao, and Muluan Village, which must be guaranteed to complete the project before the breach closure under the principle of "equal emphasis on breach closure and risk rectification."

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th. The spring repair project of the Yellow River Bohai Sea section officially began in mid-month. The Bohai Administrative Office and the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau jointly formed a Yellow River Management Headquarters to lead. During the first phase of the project from Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) to Qingming (Tomb Sweeping Day), according to statistics from six counties along the river from Lijin to Jiyang, more than 40,000 people participated in the Yellow River management. Various places also take care of spring plowing while managing the Yellow River. In addition, many dangerous works near Jinan City need to be repaired. The municipal government has collected the necessary materials and started construction on the 27th.
