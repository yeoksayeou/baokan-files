　　Huolu Sihai Discovers Landlords Sabotaging Production
    Government Punishes According to Law
    [Chahar News] In Dongmaowan Village, Sihai County, and Silonggui Village, Huolu County, individual landlords and rich peasants counterattacked the peasants and sabotaged production. The People's Government has already imposed punishments. This spring, during the final stages of land reform in Huolu County, the rich peasant Wang Jiping of Xilonggui Village, upon hearing that the poor peasant association was going to confiscate his three surplus rooms, demolished the entire house the next morning and sold the lumber. The rich peasant Wang Guirong also privately cut down eight trees that had already been confiscated and sold them. Another rich peasant even cut down all the small trees in the open space that had been confiscated. In this village, a landlord family and eight rich peasant families demolished a total of six rooms and cut down twenty trees. In Nanhuzhuang Village, the landlord Du Wenke also demolished all three rooms that had been distributed to the peasants. In Dongmaowan Village, Sihai County, the rich peasant Li Chunyuan peeled the bark off some of the apricot trees that had been allocated to the peasants and destroyed others with explosives. The above-mentioned counterattacks and destructive crimes of the landlords and rich peasants have attracted the attention of the local People's Government. The Huolu County Government has arrested the primary culprit, Wang Jiping. The governments of both counties have ordered the other landlords and rich peasants to confess their crimes at mass meetings and compensate for all losses. (Note: Sihai is a newly established county, centered on Sihaiye Town in Luanping, and composed of parts of Luanping, Huairou, Yanqing, and Chicheng counties.)
