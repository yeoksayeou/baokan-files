A Review of the Great People's Power
    Liu Baiyu

    In our days of glorious victory, another memorable day has been added, and that is March 25th. On this day, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other responsible personnel of the CCP Central Committee arrived in Beiping. That afternoon, a warm welcome rally and a solemn review ceremony were held at the Beiping West Suburb Airport.

    The spring sun shone on this vast square, and countless cars drove in, fluttering red flags. Columns of workers, peasants, youth, women, professors, artists, democratic figures from all walks of life, and cadres from government offices came here from different directions. Thousands of faces wore smiles, and thousands of eyes looked in one direction. At five o'clock, the band lined up at the entrance struck a resounding chord, "Ah! Chairman Mao is here!" The whole field erupted in cheers. When Chairman Mao appeared before the people, shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed like a surging tide. The welcoming ranks at the front included many outstanding representatives of the entire Chinese nation. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu shook hands with them one by one. The welcoming masses discussed enthusiastically: "Chairman Mao looks even more energetic than in the photos!" "Commander-in-Chief Zhu is really healthy!" Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, and Lin Zuhan also came to the welcoming crowd and shook hands with everyone. At this moment, a coal miner raised his hands and said, "I worked hard for twelve years and never saw the sky, but seeing Chairman Mao today is like seeing the sky." In the women's representative team, I saw Li Xiuzhen, a great mother of the Chinese working people who came from the countryside, persisted in the struggle for thirteen years, dedicated her beloved only son to the War of Liberation, and endured countless trials of war and prison. She held Chairman Mao's hand tightly in both hands, her eyes shining with happiness. I remember when her son sacrificed himself, her granddaughter asked her, "Papa?" She said, "Good granddaughter! I'll teach you a song—Eat your fill, dress warmly, never forget Chairman Mao when you stand up,...” And today she saw Chairman Mao with her own eyes and witnessed a great victory. Here, there are representatives from all walks of life who have come from afar, as well as warriors who have emerged from the storms of struggle. This lineup is strong. This is not a simple gathering; this intimate meeting is victory.

    After the joyous welcome, a commander of an armored regiment raised the red flag in his hand. A silver-white flare soared straight into the sky in the east, and five hundred flares immediately responded in the direction of the lush mountains to the west, like thousands of tassels hanging high in the air, swaying incessantly. This was the signal announcing the start of the review of the great people's armed forces. The troops being reviewed here included field infantry, guards, tanks, howitzers, mountain guns, anti-aircraft guns, and motorized units. Under the sunlight, they filled the entire circumference of the airport's vast runway. As Chairman Mao stood in the first light green jeep and slowly moved westward, the crowds on dozens of trucks on the left waved their arms, and countless arms waved, and the shouts of "Long live!" "Long live!" were like a raging torrent, surging and unstoppable. The military band urgently played the majestic "Liberation Army March," and the tank teams were lined up in a row, with dozens of red flags on the tanks fluttering in the wind. The howitzers were painted in a deep yellow, and the long barrels of the anti-aircraft guns pointed straight to the sky like fingers. This is historical mockery. When these weapons of American imperialism belonged to the reactionaries, they seemed easy to seize, but when they are in the hands of the people today, they become an invincible force. Look! Every gunner, every motorcycle driver, salutes with such energetic strength. The review procession, consisting of dozens of cars (including all the welcoming masses), moved forward windingly. Wherever the cars passed, the soldiers shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Professors from various universities in Beiping also raised their hands in the trucks and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" linking their voices with those of the soldiers.

    At this time, the flares in the sky were as brilliant as fireworks, row upon row, filling the sky, and the rolling cheers across the mountains and fields had reached their climax. The review reached the heroic infantry in the north who had fought countless fierce battles and emerged from difficult days into victory. The combat heroes, with medals shining on their chests, greeted Chairman Mao with serious and joyful eyes. During the review, Chairman Mao occasionally looked at the flares in the sky, but he looked more kindly at every soldier, from the artillery to the infantry. Our invincible soldiers, day and night, on the front lines, advancing wave upon wave, had been moving forward in response to Chairman Mao's great heroic call. Today, Chairman Mao looked at them and constantly praised General Liu Yalou, the commander of the review. From the car, the reporter looked at the magnificent ranks with more than forty colorful hero flags fluttering, forming an unparalleled spectacle, which, like the red lines on a statistical chart, explained the glory of this unit. This caught Chairman Mao's attention, especially when the "Heroic Defenders of Tashan" big red flag was displayed in front, and he pointed out, "This is the unit that fought in the Jinzhou campaign." Finally, the infantry military band played the music "You are the Lighthouse, Illuminating the Ocean Before Dawn," which played out the feelings of millions of people at this moment and in this place.

    The parade ended at 5:10. Chairman Mao took a photo with representatives of workers, peasants, youth, and democratic figures from all walks of life in the dazzling warm sunset. This photo will be a testament, proving that on this great day, people not only saw the epitome of the powerful people's armed forces, but also saw the epitome of the powerful democratic camp in China.

　　伟大人民力量的检阅
    刘白羽
    在我们胜利辉煌的日子里，又增加了一个可纪念的日子，这就是三月二十五日。这一天，毛主席、朱总司令和中共中央其他负责人员到达了北平。这一天下午，在北平西郊飞机场上举行了热烈的欢迎会和庄严的检阅式。
    春日的阳光照耀在这辽阔的广场上，无数汽车纷纷飘着红旗驶来。工人、农民、青年、妇女、教授、艺术家、各界民主人士和机关干部的行列，从不同的地方来到这里。千百个脸含着微笑，千百双眼睛都望着一个方向。五点时，排列在门口的乐队锵然一响，“啊！毛主席来了！”全场爆发了欢呼。当毛主席出现在人民眼前的时候，“毛主席万岁！”的口号声，如海涛回旋，此呼彼应。在前面整队欢迎的行列中，包含着全中国许多优秀的代表人物。毛主席、朱总司令一一和他们握手。欢迎的群众中纷纷议论着：“毛主席比照片上还精神！”“朱总司令真健康呀！”刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时、林祖涵等同志都来到欢迎的人群中，和大家纷纷握手。这时一个煤矿工人高举两手说：“我做十二年苦工没见过天，今天见了毛主席可见了天了。”在妇女代表队伍里，我看见从农村里来的、坚持了十三年斗争，把亲爱的独子贡献给解放战争，经历无数次战争、监狱考验的中国劳动人民的伟大母亲李秀镇，她两手紧紧捧着毛主席的手，而两眼闪着幸福的光芒。我记得当她的儿子牺牲时，她的孙女问她：“爸爸？”她说：“好孙子！我教你唱个歌——吃饱饭，穿暖衣，翻身不忘毛主席，……”而今天她亲眼看见了毛主席，看见了伟大胜利。这里有远路奔来的各界代表人士，也有经过斗争暴风雨而来的战士，这阵容是强大的，这不是简单的会合，这亲密的会晤就是胜利。
    在愉快的欢迎之后，一个装甲兵团的指挥员举起手中的红旗，东面有一颗银白色照明弹灿然直升高空，而在西面的苍郁的群岭方向，立即响应了五百发照明弹，有如万千缨络，高挂空中，荡荡不停，这是信号，宣布了伟大人民武装部队检阅开始了。在这里受检阅的包括野战步兵、警卫部队、坦克、榴弹炮、山野炮、高射炮和摩托化部队。在阳光照耀下，列满机场辽阔跑道的整个圆周。当毛主席站在第一辆浅绿色吉普车上向西缓缓前进时，左侧数十辆卡车上的人群，千万只手臂纷纷摇动，“万岁！”“万岁！”呼声就象翻江倒海，奔腾而不可遏止。军乐队急奏出雄壮的“解放军进行曲”，坦克队排列一线，坦克车上数十余面红旗迎风猎猎飘舞。榴弹炮漆成一片深黄色，高射炮长炮筒如手指向天直伸。这是历史的嘲笑，当这些美帝国主义的武器属于反动派所有的时候，他们似乎是容易被夺取的，但当今天掌握在人民手里的时候，便成为无坚不摧的力量了。看！每一个炮手、每一个摩托驾驶手，都是那样精壮有力的举手致敬。由数十辆汽车（包括所有欢迎群众）构成的检阅行列蜿蜒而进，车过之处，战士们便高呼：“毛主席万岁！”北平各大学教授的卡车上也举手高呼：“毛主席万岁！”与战士们的呼声联结一片。
    这时，天空照明弹已如万花灿烂，一排一排，布满空中，漫山遍野滚动的欢呼声，已升至最高潮。检阅到达北部历无数激战，从艰难日月走进胜利的英雄步兵面前，战斗英雄们闪耀着胸前的奖章，用严肃而愉快的目光迎着毛主席。在检阅前进时，毛主席曾偶然注视天空中的照明弹，但他更亲切地注视着从炮兵到步兵的每一个战士。我们无敌的战士们多少日日夜夜，在火线上前仆后继的时候，心中都是响应着毛主席伟大英雄号召而前进的。今天，毛主席注视着他们，不断对检阅指挥官刘亚楼将军发出称赞的语句。记者从车上瞻望这雄壮行列中飘扬着四十余面彩色缤纷的英雄旗，构成无比的奇景，它如同统计表上的红线一样说明这部队的光辉。这引起毛主席的注意，特别当“塔山守备英雄”大红旗在前面展动时，他指出“这是锦州战役作战的部队”。步兵军乐队最后奏出“你是灯塔，照耀着黎明前的海洋”的乐曲，这乐曲正奏出此时此地千万人的心情。
    阅兵式在五点十分钟完毕。毛主席在耀眼的温暖的夕照中和工、农、青年代表及各界民主人士拍摄了一张照像。这个照像将是一个见证，它证明人们在这伟大的一日里，不但看到了强大人民武装力量的缩影，同时也看到了强大中国民主阵容的缩影。
