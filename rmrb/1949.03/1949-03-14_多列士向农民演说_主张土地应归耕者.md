Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Reports from various sources: French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez delivered a speech at a farmers' meeting held in Émaux (southeast of Limoges, the capital of the Haute-Vienne department) on March 6th, calling on French men and women to vote in the provincial elections for the joint candidates of the Republicans and participants in the Resistance movement. Thorez stated that after the liberation of France, people had hoped that temporary difficulties could be overcome because, at that time, industrial production had exceeded pre-war levels, and agricultural products were also abundant. We also received promises that we could obtain large gifts from the Marshall Plan. But what has been the result of all this? Workers are impoverished, agriculture is in crisis, and taxes are unbearably heavy. They want the people to pay for the last war and for the war that is being prepared. Military spending in the budget reaches 600 billion francs. When discussing the reasons for the agricultural crisis, Thorez pointed out that this was due to the shrinking market and the insufficient purchasing power of the working people, which reduced the demand for agricultural products. Thorez said that this is nothing but a plan to destroy our agriculture after destroying our industry, because they want to turn our country into an economic colony.

Thorez declared: "Land should belong to those who cultivate it. We advocate returning the land to those who have been deprived of it. Through the alliance of the peasants and the working class, we will be able to accomplish this goal. We will pave the way for socialism."

　　多列士向农民演说
  　主张土地应归耕者
    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方报道：法国共产党领袖多列士于三月六日在埃毛提尔（在豪特·威尼省省会里摩日东南）举行的农民大会上发表演说，号召法国男女在省选中投票选举共和分子及抵抗运动参加者联合候选人。多列士称：在法国解放以后，人们曾这样希望：暂时的困难是可以克服了，因为在那个时候，工业生产已超过战前水平，农产品也丰收。我们还得到了诺言，说是可以从马歇尔计划获得大量礼物。但是，这一切的结果是什么呢？工人贫困、农业危机和无法忍受的重税。他们要使人民为上次战争，为正在准备着的战争出钱。预算中军费达六千亿法郎。多列士谈到农业危机的原因时，指出这是由于市场缩小和劳动人民购买力的不足，以致使得对农产品的需要减少。多列士说，这不是别的，而是在破坏了我国工业之后又破坏我国农业的计划，因为他们想把我国变成经济上的殖民地。
    多列士宣称：“土地应归耕种的人所有。我们主张将土地还给那些被剥夺了土地的人们。由于农民与工人阶级的联盟，我们将能完成这一目的。我们将为社会主义铺平道路。”
