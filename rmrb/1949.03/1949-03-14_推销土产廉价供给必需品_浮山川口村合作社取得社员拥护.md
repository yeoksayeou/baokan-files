(Taiyue Electricity) The Chuan Kou Village Farmers' Cooperative in the second district of Fushan promotes the sale of local products from rich lands and supplies the masses with essential production and living materials. Cooperative members receive preferential treatment in terms of buying and selling prices. As a result, the cooperative has won the support of members and the masses, and has grown rapidly. This cooperative was established in 1944. At that time, farmers pooled 80,000 yuan (Jicha), and by mid-February of this year, the funds had grown to 20 million yuan. In terms of maintaining the value of physical goods, the original capital was worth about 80-odd shi of rice. The current total value is 250 shi of millet (as of mid-February), a three-fold increase in capital accumulation and expansion. Regarding business management: In the beginning, the goal was simply to make money, and there was no definite plan. Sometimes they opened restaurants, sometimes they sold food at opera performances, sometimes they ran flour mills and sold groceries. After a year, they lost almost all of their capital, leaving only 8,000 yuan. The masses demanded "dissolving the cooperative; everyone for themselves," and it almost fell apart. After Comrades Qi Jinggui and Li Shide became managers in 1946, they adopted a "small-scale approach" and operated according to the needs of the masses. Because the enemy was blockading the area at that time, the masses had difficulty buying necessities such as salt, cotton, and matches. The cooperative relied on the assistance of state-owned trading organizations to find ways to buy these items from enemy-occupied areas of Hongdong, Quwo, and Linfen, and supplied them to the masses for consumption. Although the business was small, it was very popular with the masses. When the accounts were settled in June 1946, the capital had grown to 400,000 yuan. At this time, their biggest characteristic in business was: no empty promises, no stockpiling of large quantities of goods, quick buying, quick selling. In the second half of the year, the masses collected a lot of wild yams that they couldn't sell, but when people got sick, they didn't have money to buy medicine. The cooperative collected many wild yams such as Platycodon, Saposhnikovia divaricata, and Anemarrhena asphodeloides, and sold them in Jiyuan, Changzi, and Baodian. They exchanged them for various Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials and other ready-made medicines, totaling 120 jin, which solved this difficulty.

During the spring plowing in 1947, there was a shortage of farm tools. The cooperative collected 1,000 jin of scrap iron from the masses and hired blacksmiths to make various farm tools. They also purchased 120 hoes from Yangcheng and sold them to the masses. In terms of price, the cooperative gave members many discounts. For example, at that time, the purchase price of each hoe in Yangcheng was 180 yuan. At that time, general merchants in Fushan raised the market price, selling each for 350 yuan. The cooperative sold each to members for 240 yuan, and they were sold out in three days. Last January, 1,000 jin of salt was purchased from Yuncheng in the same way. The purchase price at the salt pool was 100 yuan per jin, the local market price was 280 yuan, and it was sold to members for 180 yuan per jin. When absorbing the products of the masses, the cooperative also paid a higher price than the general price. For example, last April, 60 jin of various wild yams were purchased. At that time, general pharmacies only gave 12,500 yuan, but the cooperative paid 35,000 yuan to buy them, and transported the yams to Jiyuan to exchange for 15 jin of Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials, which were worth 70,000 yuan at the current market price. Both the cooperative and the medicine-collecting masses felt it was beneficial. The masses reflected: "It is cheaper to buy things in the cooperative, and you get more money for selling things. This is our own cooperative." According to statistics, last year, the purchase of medicinal materials, local cloth, shoes, scrap iron, and other items from the masses, and the sale of farm tools, salt, cotton, and ready-made medicines to the masses, allowed cooperative members and the masses to gain 2,401,600 yuan more than if they had exchanged goods on the market. This promoted mass production. For example, there are many medicinal materials on the mountain. In the past, people were afraid of "digging them up and not being able to sell them, no one will buy them." Since the cooperative has planned to absorb them, farmers, children, and cowherds have been paying attention to digging up medicinal materials at any time, which has increased the income of the masses a lot. Old Wang, who was reclaiming wasteland, picked up 48 jin of Saposhnikovia divaricata and Platycodon, etc., while reclaiming wasteland last March, and exchanged them for 32 jin of salt and 20 packs of matches from the cooperative. A cowherd exchanged 17 or 18 jin of herbal medicine for two new towels and said happily: "If it wasn't for the cooperative, how could I have exchanged for two towels?" Therefore, members and other masses all reflected: "Qi Jinggui and Li Shide are leading well!" The two of them have been continuously elected and re-elected as the manager and deputy manager by the members.

　　推销土产廉价供给必需品
    浮山川口村合作社取得社员拥护
    【太岳电】浮山二区川口村农民合作社，推销富地土产，供给群众生产与生活上的必需品，买卖价格上，社员受到优待，因此合作社得到社员和群众的拥护，很快发展壮大起来。这个合作社是一九四四年开办的，当时农民集股八万元（冀钞下同），到今年二月中旬资金已发展到两千万元了。从实物保本方面计算，原资本当时约合八十多石米，现在总值二百五十石小米（指二月中旬），资本积累和扩大了三倍。该社在经营管理上：开始时，单为赚钱，也没一定计划，有时开饭铺、赶戏场卖饭；有时开粉坊、卖杂货，一年下来把资本赔的只剩下八千多元，群众要求“解散合作社；各干各的”，几乎散了伙。自一九四六年齐景贵、李世德两同志当了经理以后，他们就“小本小干”，根据群众需要办事。因当时敌人封锁；群众买食盐、棉花、洋火等必需品发生困难，合作社就依靠公营贸易机关的帮助，设法从洪洞、曲沃、临汾敌占区，往回买这些东西，供给群众消费；虽然生意不大，却很受群众欢迎。一九四六年六月结帐，资本就发展到四十万元。这时他们在营业上的最大特点是：不做空盘，不积存大批货物，买的快，销的快。后半年群众采集下很多山药卖不了，可是人病了又没钱买不起药；合作社就收集了桔梗、防风、知母等许多山药，到济源、长子、鲍店去卖了；换回了各样川广药材跟其他成药一百二十斤，解决了这个困难。
    一九四七年春耕时，农具困难，合作社一面收集了群众一千斤废铁，雇铁匠打制各样农具；一面又从阳城贩回一百二十张锄，卖给群众；在价格上，合作社让给社员许多便宜，如当时在阳城每张锄买价是一百八十元，当时浮山一般商人高抬市价，每张卖三百五十元，合作社卖给社员，每张是二百四十元，三天便卖光了。去年正月从运城贩回食盐一千斤，也是这样，在盐池上买价是每斤一百元，当地市价二百八十元，卖给社员每斤是一百八十元。在吸收群众产品时，合作社又比一般价钱高，象去年四月，收买了各样山药六十斤，按当时一般药铺只给一万二千五百元，合作社出了三万五千元买下，把山药运到济源换回川广药材十五斤，按当时市价就值七万元。合作社和采药群众，双方都感到有利。群众反映说：“在合作社买东西便宜，卖东西钱多，这是咱自己的合作社。”统计去年收买群众药材、土布、鞋、废铁等东西，卖给群众农具、食盐、棉花、成药，社员群众比在市场上发生交换关系能多得和便宜二百四十万一千六百元。这样推动了群众生产，如山上药材很多，过去人们都怕“刨上卖不了，没人收”；自合作社有计划地吸收以来，农民、儿童、放牛的孩子都随时注意刨药材，增加了群众不少的收入。开荒的老王，去年三月一面开荒地，一面就拾下防风、桔梗等草药四十八斤，向合作社换了三十二斤盐，二十包洋火。一个放牛孩子，以十七、八斤草药，换了两条新毛巾，高兴的说：“不是合作社，还能换上两条手巾？”所以社员和其他群众都反映说：“齐景贵、李世德领导的好！”他们两人，一直被社员们连选连任着正、副经理。
