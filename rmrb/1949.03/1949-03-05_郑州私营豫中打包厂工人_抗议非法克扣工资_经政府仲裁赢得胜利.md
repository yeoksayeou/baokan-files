Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 27th: Workers at the private Yuzhong Packaging Factory (a factory for baling cotton) in Zhengzhou protested against the manager, Qian Yunqing's, deduction of wages. After continuous protests by the factory workers and arbitration by the Zhengzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Trade Union, the workers have won a complete victory. Qian's wage deduction was linked to his violation of the machine leasing contract with the power company. In December of last year, the Zhengzhou Electric Power Company, in order to solve the problem of industrial electricity consumption, leased a 200-horsepower engine and a boiler from the packaging factory. At that time, it was agreed that the lease term would be six months. If the machine broke down during the lease period, the packaging factory would be responsible for timely repairs. The rent was 600,000 yuan per month (Central Plains currency, same below), with 200,000 yuan of this amount being used as wages for the fifteen workers managing the engine. However, after the leased engine started working, it proved to have only 80 horsepower, which resulted in insufficient power and affected seven flour mills that were forced to shut down. Later, after inspection by the packaging factory's technicians and other power experts, it was proven that the hot water pipe of the engine had already ruptured before the lease. At the same time, Qian Yunqing did not implement the provision in the contract regarding the monthly payment of 200,000 yuan for workers' wages, but only paid 118,000 yuan, making it difficult for workers to maintain their livelihoods. When the power company negotiated with Qian of the packaging factory according to the contract, Qian delayed in every possible way and refused with a "refund of the lease." It was not until January 18th that a written agreement was reached after the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, together with the Trade Union, convened a meeting of both parties to discuss the matter. Regarding the machine, it was agreed that before the hot water pipe was repaired, the rent would be paid at half the rate. After the repair, the rent would be calculated based on the actual horsepower generated. Regarding the workers' wages, it was agreed that the full amount of 200,000 yuan should be paid first. If the workers' livelihood could not be maintained, the wages earned by the workers before liberation should be converted into the equivalent value of actual goods at that time, and appropriate adjustments should be made to increase the wages accordingly. However, after the event, Qian not only implemented the agreement regarding the repair of the machine, but also failed to implement the agreement on workers' wages, and also deducted other income that the workers should have received. The 2,000 yuan bonus given to each worker by the factory at the end of the lunar year was stipulated when the factory started operations, but Qian Yunqing also broke his promise and insisted on deducting it from the workers' wages in February. At the same time, more than 20,000 yuan that the workers earned from selling their accumulated manure and grass on January 12 was also deducted by Qian by eight tenths. Workers Du Xuesheng and Yao Zhongshan were forced to resign because they expressed dissatisfaction with this harsh treatment. This incident aroused extreme anger among the workers, so they held meetings to protest on January 25th and 26th, and sent representatives to negotiate with Qian twice, but Qian avoided meeting them each time. The Municipal Trade Union heard about the above situation and held a workers' meeting again on the morning of the 28th, inviting Qian to participate and listen to the workers' opinions, but Qian refused to participate again. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Trade Union, believing that Qian had repeatedly violated the contract and in order to protect the interests of the workers, convened a meeting of labor and management of the Yuzhong Packaging Factory in early February for arbitration. At the meeting, all the workers, in addition to demanding that the forced-to-resign workers be reinstated quickly, also demanded: (1) Wages should be calculated uniformly based on the base salary before liberation converted into actual goods; (2) In the future, the factory must go through the packaging industry trade union before increasing or decreasing workers; (3) The shortfall of wages not paid in kind in January should be made up according to the price of wheat on January 13; (4) Manure and grass money should be issued based on whether or not one participated in labor. Qian Yunqing saw that the workers were united and knew that he was in the wrong, so he changed his previous unreasonable attitude and admitted to all the workers' demands one by one. Finally, the representative of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce pointed out one after another that Qian Yunqing's repeated failure to fulfill the contract and his dismissal of workers without cause were illegal acts that the government would not allow, and that the conditions proposed by the workers today should be implemented one by one; otherwise, the government would impose sanctions according to law.

　　郑州私营豫中打包厂工人
  　抗议非法克扣工资
    经政府仲裁赢得胜利
    【新华社中原二十七日电】郑州市私营豫中打包厂（即打棉花包的工厂）经理钱云卿克扣工人工资，经该厂工人不断抗议与郑州市工商局、职工会仲裁，工人已赢得完全胜利。钱某克扣工人工资的事件，和他破坏与电力公司所订机器租赁合同的违法行为相联系。去年十二月，郑州市电力公司为解决工业用电，曾租赁打包厂二百匹马力发动机及锅炉各一部，当时议定租期六个月，租期内如机器发生故障，打包厂应负责及时修理，租金每月六十万元（中州币，下同），以其中二十万元作为该厂管理发动机的十五个工人的工资。但租赁之发动机在开工后证明只有八十匹马力，以致因电力不足而影响七家面粉厂陷于停工。后经打包厂技师及其他电力专家检查证明：该发动机之热水管已在租赁前破裂。同时，合同中关于每月以二十万元支付工人工资的规定，钱云卿亦未实行，而仅付出十一万八千元，使得工人难以维持生活。在电力公司依据合同向打包厂钱某交涉时，钱某百般拖延并以“退租”相拒。直到一月十八日，经市工商局会同职工会召集双方当事人商谈，才取得书面协议。关于机器部分，议定在热水管大修配前，租金按一半付给。修好后按实际发动力多少计算租金。工人工资则协议先应发足二十万元之数，如工人不足维持生活，则应以解放前工人所得工资折合当时所值实物计算，予以适当调整，酌量提高。但事后钱某除执行关于修理机器部分之协议外，对工人工资问题，不但未执行协议，且克扣工人的其他应得收入。该厂旧历年关时发给每一工人的二千元奖金，系该厂开工时所规定，但钱云卿亦违约食言，坚持要从二月份工人工资中扣除。同时，工人们在一月十二日出卖自己积累粪草所得的二万余元，亦为钱某扣占十分之八。工人杜雪生、姚仲山二人且因对此苛待表示不满而被逼退工。此事引起工人极度愤怒，乃于一月二十五、二十六两日集会抗议，并两次派出代表向钱某交涉，但钱某均避而不见。市职工会闻悉上述情况，又于二十八日上午召开工人大会，邀钱某参加听取工人意见，但钱某再次拒绝参加。工商局与职工会以钱某屡次违约，为保障工人利益，遂于二月上旬召集豫中打包厂劳资双方集会，予以仲裁。会中全体工人除要求被逼退工人迅速复工外并要求：（一）工资应一律按解放前底薪折合实物计算；（二）厂方今后增减工人，必须经过打包业工会；（三）一月份未按实物发给工资之不足数，应按一月十三日麦价补足之；（四）粪草钱应根据参加劳动与否发给。钱云卿见工人团结一致，且明知自己理亏，遂转变过去之蛮横态度，对工人所提要求均一一承认。最后工商局代表，相继指出钱云卿再次不履行合同，无故解雇工人，是为政府所不允许的违法行为，今天工人所提条件，当一一实施，否则，政府当依法制裁。
