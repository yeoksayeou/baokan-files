　　Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Plant Workers
　　Organize Internships by Workshop
　　[Zhangjiakou News] Workers in state-owned enterprises in Zhangjiakou City are actively studying politics and culture. The Ping绥 Railway General Trade Union established a General Study Committee, printed a large number of important documents such as Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," "Chairman Mao's Statement on the Current Situation," "Labor University Documents," and "Collection of Current Affairs Essays," and distributed them to subordinate study units. They also established a library to facilitate employee learning, and hired specialists to answer questions arising during study. The Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Plant established a workers' spare-time supplementary school to study politics, algebra, electricity, drafting, machinery, locomotive outlines, and general culture. At the same time, internship groups were divided according to workshops, and foremen and engineers familiar with the business in the workshops were responsible for guiding the internships during working hours. In addition to the general study organizations, young employees of the Zhangjiakou South Power Plant also established a youth night school. Flour mills, lumber mills, oil extraction plants, food factories, rubber factories and other units have also established study systems. The Zhangjiakou Mechanized Flour Mill provides employees with pencils and notebooks to help everyone learn. After studying, the enthusiasm of the workers in state-owned enterprises throughout the city has greatly increased. Workers at the Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Plant recovered discarded parts from scrap iron piles to repair vehicles, solving the difficulty of lacking parts for repairing vehicles. The riveting furnace team invented a method of electric welding locomotive boiler smoke pipes, which not only overcame the difficulty of not being able to repair without oxygen, but also reduced costs. Workers at the Zhangjiakou Mechanized Flour Mill, recognizing that supporting the People's Liberation Army means defending the interests of the working class, voluntarily increased their working hours from eight to ten hours per day.
