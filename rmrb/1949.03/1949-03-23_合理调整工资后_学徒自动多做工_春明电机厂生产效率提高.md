　　After Reasonable Wage Adjustment,
    Apprentices Voluntarily Work More
    Production Efficiency Increased at Chunming Electric Motor Factory
    [Ping City News] After reasonable resolution of labor-capital issues at the Chunming Electric Motor Factory, the morale of both sides is high, and production has greatly increased. The factory has a nine-year history and currently has six workers (previously there were twenty-one). The original treatment was very low. Among the six workers, five were apprentices without wages; one had been an apprentice for four years and also received no wages. After liberation, they voluntarily organized and proposed being paid wages. After the Ninth District Trade Union work team understood this situation, they helped convene a labor-capital symposium to explain the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and that the factory's production status, current living standards, and the workers' technical skills should be used as the basis for wage negotiation. Everyone agreed with this basic spirit, and the two sides negotiated new wages: apprentices in the first year would receive 20 jin of millet per month, 70 jin in the second year, 120 jin in the third year, 150 jin in the fourth year, and after the fifth year they would graduate as technicians with a wage of 200 jin (Editor's note: Distinctions should be made based on each person's progress and production efficiency). Year-end bonuses would be discussed and agreed upon by both parties based on the past system. It was also agreed that in the future, workers could participate in trade union organizations, study groups, and learn various policies, and freely read books and newspapers without affecting work hours. After the wage adjustment, workers' work enthusiasm was particularly high. For example, winding five-horsepower electric motor coils previously took five days to complete, but now it takes only three days. Three-horsepower electric motor coils can now be completed in one and a half days. Workers dispatched to install motors outside the factory quickly returned after completing the installation, and no one wasted time outside. This has made the manager begin to realize the benefits of mutual benefit for labor and capital and has great confidence in the factory's development.

　　合理调整工资后
    学徒自动多做工
    春明电机厂生产效率提高
    【平市讯】春明电机工厂劳资问题合理解决，双方情绪高涨，生产大为增加。该厂有九年历史，现有工人六人（以前曾有过二十一人）。原来待遇非常低。六个工人中，五个是学徒，没有工资；一个已学四年，也没有工资。解放后，他们自动组织起来，提出发给工资。九区工会工作组了解了这个情况后，即帮助召开了劳资座谈会，说明劳资两利的原则，要以工厂生产状况，现在生活水平，工人技术高低，作为议定工资的基础。大家同意这个基本精神，便由双方议定新的工资：学徒第一年每月小米二十斤，第二年七十斤，第三年一百二十斤，第四年一百五十斤，第五年出师，当技工，工资二百斤（编者按：根据各人进步快慢，生产效率高低，应有区别）。年底分红，根据过去制度，双方再行议定。并议定今后工人在不影响工作时间下，参加工会组织，学习小组，学习各种政策，自由阅读书报。工资调整后，工人工作情绪特别高。例如缠五马力的电滚线包，从前须五天才能完成，现在三天就完成了。三马力的电滚线包，一天半就能完成。派到外面按装电机的工人，装妥后便很快返回，谁也不在外面浪费时间。这使经理也开始体会到劳资两利的好处。对发展工厂信心很大。（第九区春明电机厂联工学习小组）
