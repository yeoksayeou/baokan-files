Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: We are providing this experience from the Shenyang Workers' Training Class for reference in various regions. Currently, in the newly liberated areas, especially in the newly liberated cities, running short-term political training classes or schools for workers, staff, and young students, and extensively and universally training workers, staff, and students from all walks of life to enable them to understand the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the various basic policies of New Democracy, and to stand on the side of the people and serve the people, is one of our most fundamental political tasks at present. However, the educational content listed in item four of this experience is not entirely appropriate, as it lacks basic educational content and has no central focus. The content of this education, in addition to enabling students to understand the basic issues of the Chinese revolution, understand the current revolutionary policies, and link them to the current organizational tasks and work issues of their own, the most basic and important thing should be to enable students to understand the various classes and class struggles in society, to understand that labor creates the world, that the exploiting classes exploit surplus labor, the social status of wage laborers and salaried classes, how to strive for the liberation of laborers, and the tasks and characteristics of the Communist Party. Only through this basic education can they break with many of their past outdated views, give them a new outlook on life and the world, and stand on the correct position to understand various policies. This is the most important educational content and must be the center of this initial political education. We hope that the comrades working in training classes and revolutionary schools in various places will pay attention to this.

　　I. There is a great need to run training classes at present.
Based on the initial experience of worker's work in Shenyang for a month after liberation, it can be seen that running short-term rotational training classes for workers is a good way to connect with the masses, universally and systematically carry out publicity and education to the newly liberated workers, quickly open up the work situation, and discover and cultivate activists. It is suitable for the urgent requirements of the vast number of workers at present, and it is also a good way to carry out worker's work in the environment of newly liberated cities with few cadres and large and scattered factories.

　　II. Training Time and Scale
Currently, short-term worker's training classes have been set up in various factories in Tiexi, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, the Military Industry Department, the Quartermaster Department, the Textile Administration Bureau, and the Shenyang Railway Worker's Short-Term School. The training time ranges from half a month at the longest to only four days at the shortest, and generally from seven to ten days. Each session ranges from hundreds to more than five hundred people, with the smallest having only twenty or so people. According to the experience of the past month, if too many people are concentrated in each session and there are few leading cadres, it is often difficult to grasp leadership and it is not easy to deeply discover and focus on cultivating activists. However, too few people (such as a factory with tens of thousands of people only drawing twenty or so people for training in the first session) is also not suitable for objective requirements. If the time is long, of course, more things can be taught and more can be learned about the students' learning and ideological situation, but it prevents most people from getting the opportunity to be universally trained, and teachers and teaching materials also feel lacking. At the same time, as the time is prolonged and the content of learning is complicated, it will make it difficult for the students to digest all at once. If the time is shorter, it can be more closely coordinated with the current overall work. For example, after the Tiexi short-term training class concentrated on explaining several central issues in five or six days, the trained workers immediately returned to the factory, which not only did not affect production, but also allowed them to connect with the masses more and carry out extensive propaganda, and combine it with preparing for the establishment of a representative meeting.
The length of the training time is best determined according to the purpose of the rotational training. If you want to meet the masses universally in a relatively short period of time, carry out some planned and step-by-step enlightenment education, and discover some activists in time so that they can immediately contact the masses, then the time does not need to be too long. If you are preparing to focus on training a group of people with a goal, focusing on understanding the ideological situation of each of them, and educating and transforming them by distinguishing between good and bad, then the time must be longer. The former is like the railway short-term training class, which only lasts for a week. They only require the trained students to be able to act as propagandists when they go back, and the seventy or so activists discovered and cultivated in the first session can take on three aspects of work: (1) After returning, in addition to their own business, they can participate in the work of the academic committees (transitional organizations of worker's unions) of various departments. (2) Serve as staff members of the railway office. (3) Stay in the short-term school as squadron leaders, etc. The latter, such as the training class of the postal and telecommunications department, has more personnel in their work posts and can draw a group of workers to conduct more ideological education, so they are preparing to run the second session for a month.

　　III. Selection Steps and Organizational Leadership Issues
Some of the training objects are drawn without any selection, and everyone comes in shifts. Some are selected in a planned and focused manner after preliminary investigation and understanding. Especially in the first session, this planning is still necessary. This is convenient for initially conducting education, understanding and studying worker's thoughts, and absorbing teaching experience. In addition, staff and workers should be trained separately, or at least pay attention to appropriate allocation when forming groups. The groups should not be too large. When there are not enough cadres, the masses can elect or the leaders can appoint study group leaders, which can play a great role in assisting leadership in learning.
In addition to organizing lectures, discussions, and answering questions, the leadership should focus more on leading research on comprehensive central issues, especially conducting individual conversations outside of class, which can further solve ideological problems for the students. For example, in the training classes of the Textile Administration Bureau and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, some students, after being enlightened by collective learning, and after individual conversations, automatically said that they were members of the Kuomintang or the Three Youth Leagues, which was welcomed by everyone.

　　IV. Content and Methods of Education
Although the content of education varies from training class to training class, it generally includes the following issues: (1) Current situation. (2) New Democracy. (3) Several specific policies: including land reform policy, industrial and commercial policy, judicial policy, workers and staff issues, etc. (4) People's enterprises and workers. (5) The Communist Party and the working class. (6) Worker's unions and other issues. According to the preliminary feedback from the workers, the courses set by many training classes are still too heavy. Workers want to understand many issues, but it is difficult to fully accept them in a short period of time. Too much content easily blurs the center and affects students' acceptance of basic issues. For example, some training classes drafted a discussion outline, planning to list the entire history from September 18th to today in a three-hour discussion meeting, and the result was either very superficial or completely irrelevant.
Workers are eager to understand a few basic issues and require clear and concise explanations. Secondly, when explaining, it must be linked to the actual life of the workers. For example, when the Tiexi training class talked to the workers about the Kuomintang, they first talked about what happened when the Kuomintang came? The workers complained one after another, and then analyzed why the Kuomintang was so bad, and then analyzed the Kuomintang's policies and history. So that everyone can get a clear concept.
From the ideological education of several training classes, I feel that there are two issues that must be clarified. First: In addition to making workers recognize today's victorious situation, it is also necessary to emphasize the task of supporting the national war. Also, some workers have excessively high expectations for "improving their lives after liberation." When the Tiexi training class explained this issue, it first started from sympathizing with their past suffering, and at the same time explained that all the suffering and today's difficulties were caused by the evil rule of the Kuomintang. Today, to overcome difficulties, we must develop production and actively support the war, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. And clarify that as long as we actively engage in economic construction, our living difficulties will be gradually resolved. Finally, the workers truly understood that today they still have to "grit their teeth and work hard to produce in order to prosper the economy and improve their lives." Second: It is necessary to make the workers understand what attitude they should take as masters after liberation, that is, in addition to their own active production, they should abide by all policies, laws, systems and disciplines formulated by the Communist Party and the democratic government. Therefore, it is necessary to patiently persuade and educate against the phenomenon of extreme democracy among the workers. Any failure to listen to transfer, command, free action, failure to abide by discipline and system, late arrival and early departure, thinking that "today we are the masters, no one can control" and so on, are incorrect. This also includes the issue of contradictions between workers and staff. In this regard, according to the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's "Decision on Staff Issues in Public Enterprises," the policy should be explained to the workers, and the workers can accept it.

　　V. After the students are trained
During the training period, propaganda and education should be linked to organizational work, otherwise, when the training class ends, the relationship between the leaders and the students will also be interrupted. Many activists who are discovered find it difficult to go down to play a greater role. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out certain organizational work, especially to establish necessary contacts with the students after graduation. After mass recommendation and leadership approval, the Tiexi training class determined that each branch factory should have a person responsible for continuing to contact the leadership after returning to the factory. In addition to being a propagandist like everyone else, he also collects some opinions and requirements from everyone on learning, as well as ideological conditions, and reports to the person in charge on a regular basis (three or five days). This not only maintains regular contact with these activists, but also tests them in action, which is also very useful for preparing for the establishment of a trade union organization in the future.
After being trained, the workers are generally in high spirits, and their thinking and understanding have improved. Wu Shouben, an old worker in his fifties at the Smelting Plant, said: "Our workers must cherish our factories like we cherish our own pots, bowls, and chopsticks. We should find ways to use them for six or seven years instead of three or five years." After returning from training, workers from smelting rubber and other factories automatically criticized individual workers who were loafing on the job or not abiding by discipline. Workers from a factory volunteered to work overtime day and night to repair weapons for the garrison. The office of the Railway Worker's Union received more than 20 phone calls or letters from workers every day, asking them to answer questions they encountered in their studies. Some people came from far away by tram to ask for advice on learning. After initial enlightenment education, the workers' awareness is constantly improving. [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd]

　　沈阳职工短期训练班介绍
    萧彦
    新华社编者注：这里介绍一篇沈阳职工训练班的经验给各地参考。目前在各新解放区、特别是在新解放的城市中，办理工人的、职员的、青年学生的短期政治训练班或学校，大量地、普遍地训练各行各业的工人职员和学生，使他们懂得马克思列宁主义的基本原理和新民主主义的各项基本政策，而站到人民的立场上来，为人民服务，乃是目前我们最基本的政治任务之一。但这篇经验第四项中所列教育内容，则不完全妥当，其中缺少基本教育内容，没有中心。这种教育的内容，除开使学生懂得中国革命的基本问题，了解当前各项革命政策，并联系当前本身的组织任务与工作问题而外，最基本最重要的，应该使学生懂得社会各阶级与阶级斗争，懂得劳动创造世界，剥削阶级剥削剩余劳动，工钱劳动者和薪水阶级的社会地位，如何争取劳动者的解放，以及共产党的任务与特点等。经过这种基本的教育，才能打破他们过去许多陈旧的观点，使他们具有新的人生观和世界观，站在正确的立场上去了解各项政策。这是首先重要的教育内容，必须以此为中心去进行这种初步的政治教育。望各地训练班及革命学校的工作同志注意。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一、目前很需要办训练班
    根据沈阳解放后一个月职工工作的初步体验，可以看出，开办职工短期轮训班是联系群众，普遍而有计划地向新解放的职工进行宣传教育，迅速打开工作局面，并发现与培养积极分子的一种很好的办法。它适合于当前广大职工急迫的要求，也是新解放城市中干部很少、工厂规模却大而分散的环境下进行职工工作的很好方式。
    二、训练的时间与规模
    现在已经开办起来的，有铁西各工厂、邮电局、军工部、军需部、纺织管理局等部门的职工短训班以及沈阳铁路职工短期学校等处。训练的时间，最长的半月，最短的仅四天，一般的则为七天至十天。每期从百人到五百余人，最少的只有二十余人。根据月来经验，若每期集中人数过多，领导干部少，常常不易掌握领导，不能深入发现与有重点地培养积极分子。但人数太少（如某成万人的工厂中，第一期只抽了二十余人受训），也是不适合于客观要求的。时间长了，固然可以多教些东西，多了解一些学员的学习与思想情况，但却使大多数人得不到普遍轮训的机会，教员与教材亦感缺乏。同时，时间拉长，学习的内容繁杂了，会使学员一下消化不了。而时间短些，可与当前的整个工作配合得更紧。如铁西短训班在五六天内集中讲清几个中心问题后，受训职工马上就回到工厂中，既不影响生产，又可通过他们更多地去联系群众，进行广泛宣传，并结合酝酿成立代表会等。
    确定训练时间的长短，最好是根据轮训的目的而定。想在比较短促的时间内，普遍与群众见面，进行些有计划有步骤地启蒙教育，并及时发现些积极分子，使其立即去联系群众的话，时间不必过长。若是准备有目标地集中一批人受训，着重了解他们每个人的思想情况，区别优劣进行教育与改造的话，时间就得长些。前一种如铁路短训班，只一周时间，他们只要求受训的学员都能回去起宣传员的作用，而在第一期发现和培养的七十余名积极分子，则可担负三方面的工作：（一）回去后除本身业务外，可参加各部门学委会（职工会过渡组织）工作。（二）充当铁路办事处的工作人员。（三）留在短期学校担任分队长等。后一种如邮电部门的训练班，他们工作岗位上的人员较多，能够抽出一批职工多进行一些思想教育，所以他们第二期准备办一个月。
    三、抽调步骤及组织领导问题
    抽调训练的对象，有的是毫无选择地抽调，大家轮班来。有的则是经过了初步的调查了解，有步骤有重点地抽调对象。特别是第一期，这种计划性还是必要的。这在最初进行教育，了解与研究职工思想，吸取教学经验方面都有方便之处。另外，职员与工人最好分开训练，至少在编小组时应注意适当地配备。编组不宜太大。干部不够时，可由群众自选或由领导指定学习小组长，对领导学习，能起不少协助作用。
    领导上除了组织讲课、讨论、解答问题外，应多集中于领导研究全面中心的问题，特别是课外进行个别谈话，可以进一步地给学员解决思想问题。如纺织管理局、邮电局短训班中，有些学员，从集体学习得到了启示后，又经过了个别谈话，便自动说出自己是国民党或三青团员，受到大家欢迎。
    四、教育的内容与方式方法
    各个训练班教育的内容，虽有不同，但大致有以下几个问题：（一）目前形势。（二）新民主主义。（三）几个具体政策：包括土地改革政策，工商业政策，司法政策，工人与职员问题等。（四）人民企业与职工。（五）共产党与工人阶级。（六）职工会等问题。根据职工初步的反映，很多训练班订的课程，尚嫌繁重。职工想理解的问题甚多，但在短短时间内难以完全接受得了。内容太多了，容易模糊了中心，影响学员对基本问题的接受。譬如有的训练班拟了一份讨论提纲，计划在三小时的讨论会上，把九一八到今天的历史全列上去，结果不是谈得非常肤浅，就是扯得漫无边际。
    工人急迫要求了解几个基本问题，且要求讲解得明确扼要。其次，讲解时，必须与职工的实际生活联系起来。如铁西训练班给职工讲国民党时，就先讲国民党来了怎么样？职工纷纷诉苦，然后分析为什么国民党这么坏，进而分析国民党的政策与历史。使大家都能得一明确概念。
    从几处训练班的思想教育中，感到有两个问题必须解释清楚。第一：除使工人认清今天的胜利形势外，还需强调说明支援全国战争的任务。又如有些工人对“翻身解放后的生活改善”存在着过高的想望，铁西训练班对这问题解释时，是首先从同情他们过去的痛苦讲起，同时讲明所有的痛苦与今天的困难，都是国民党罪恶的统治造成的恶果，今天要战胜困难，就得发展生产，积极支援战争，早日打垮蒋介石，并且讲清只要我们积极从事经济建设，我们的生活困难是会逐步解决的。最后工友们才真正明白了今天还得“咬紧牙根加劲生产，才能繁荣经济，改善生活。”第二：是要使工人懂得解放后自己应以什么态度当主人的问题，即是除了自身积极生产外，应该遵守共产党、民主政府制定的一切政策法令、制度与纪律。因此必须针对工人中存在的极端民主的现象进行耐心说服教育，任何不听调动、指挥，自由行动，不守纪律与制度，迟到早退，觉得“今天咱是主人了，谁也管不了”等等，都是不正确的。这里面，还包含着工人与职员之间存在着矛盾的问题，对此，应根据东北局“关于公营企业中职员问题的决定”的精神，向工人讲明政策，工人是能接受的。
    五、学员受训以后
    训练期间，应使宣传教育与组织工作联系起来，不然，训练班结束，领导与学员的关系也就中断了。发现的许多积极分子，难以下去起更大的作用。因此必须进行一定的组织工作，特别是毕业后应与学员建立必要的联系。铁西训练班经过群众推荐，领导批准，确定了每分厂有一个负责回厂后继续与领导上联系的人。他除了象大家一样，作一个宣传员外，还搜集一些大家对学习的意见与要求，以及思想情况，按期（三天或五天）向负责同志进行汇报。这样不仅与这些积极分子保持着经常的联系，且可在行动中考验他们，这样对今后酝酿筹备工会组织，也是很有作用的。
    工人受训后，情绪一般都很高，思想与认识上都前进了一步。冶炼厂五十多岁的老工友吴守本说：“我们工友要象爱护自家的锅、碗、筷一样爱护咱们的工厂，应该用三五年的，要想办法用它六七年。”冶炼橡胶等厂的工友受训回来后，自动对个别磨洋工或不守纪律的工友进行了批评。某工厂工友自报奋勇日夜加班，给驻军修理武器，铁路职工会办事处，每天收到二十余工人打电话或写信等，要求给他们解答学习中遇到的问题。有的从很远的地方坐电车亲自跑来请教学习方面的问题。经过初步的启蒙教育，职工的觉悟在不断地提高中。【新华社沈阳三日电】
