[Jizhong Telegram] The Anci County Party Committee, relying on the masses, has established sixty village-level people's political powers. In early January, the county committee reviewed the right-leaning error of retaining enemy and puppet personnel without principle. Therefore, at the beginning of this work, the entire county universally focused on training puppet baojia personnel in small-area units, exposing their criminal facts at mass meetings, ordering them to register all enemy and puppet materials, weapons, and personnel of enemy and puppet organizations. To the masses, it was announced that the government was an organ serving the people and would resolutely safeguard the people's interests. At the same time, district cadres went deep into the masses, doing their best to help the masses solve some difficulties in production and life. In Chengguan, District One, it was discovered that the masses were having difficulties because the enemy had destroyed the saltpeter industry. The promotion society immediately lent 30,000 catties of grain and organized forty-two poor households to refine saltpeter. Seeing that the government was standing up for the people, the masses themselves demanded the overthrow of the puppet regime. In Puzhao Ying Village, District Seven, district cadres went to the homes of poor peasants to visit them during the Spring Festival and helped them solve some difficulties in getting through the New Year. The masses experienced our kindness to them in practice and dared to make their demands, inquiring whether we would still stand up for them and distribute land. Based on the mood of the masses, tenant farmers' meetings were held in separate areas. After class education, the masses all demanded to unite. Some automatically stated, "Whoever is won over by the landlord does not want to have food to eat." Then, relying on the discovered poor peasant activists, uniting the majority of peasants, a village-wide mass meeting was held to expose the crimes of the puppet baojia personnel, resolutely dismissing those who were bad. And at this meeting, a new village political power was democratically elected. This experience promoted the widespread development of the transformation of political power. After a month, sixty new village political powers were established in one hundred and sixty-seven newly liberated villages. After the people obtained political power, their enthusiasm was extremely high. The masses in Dongchou Village immediately demanded the issuance of guns, demanding to use arms to monitor the activities of bad elements to protect their own interests. Many villages also launched a struggle against hidden land. The masses in Hongshi Village freely organized two groups to discuss the landlord's hidden land, discovering that the landlord Qiao Wenbin had 170 mu of hidden land. The landlord Wang Dehe in Shicao Village speculatively reported 150 mu of hidden land, but was immediately discovered by poor peasants, forcing him to report all of his hidden land, which amounted to 270 mu. According to preliminary statistics from eleven villages in Districts Seven and Eight, a total of 9,070 mu of hidden land were uncovered. Four points of experience were gained in this period of work: (1) In the work of the new district, it is very important to establish a strict meeting and reporting system, so that deviations in the work can be quickly discovered. Generally, the easiest thing to happen is to focus on one thing and lose sight of the other: paying attention to establishing political power, ignoring the suppression of armed bandits and special agents; caring for the dependents of soldiers, ignoring the control of enemy and puppet personnel. Only through timely reporting and inspection can problems be discovered and corrected more quickly. (2) After the people themselves have control of political power, we should be cautious to build our armed forces, in order to prevent sabotage from bandits and special agents. As soon as a village government is established in District One, so is a village armed organization. (3) We should pay attention to giving more support and assistance to newly elected cadres. Some bad elements deliberately find fault with the new cadres and make things difficult for them. We should take a resolute attitude to crack down on those bad elements. (4) County and district cadres must not live in the homes of landlords under the pretext of housing difficulties, because the people in the new district pay close attention to our every word and action. The work team in Shicao Village lived in the home of a landlord, and the masses did not reflect any problems until it was discovered and corrected.

　　安次新区摧毁伪保甲统治
  　六十村建立人民政权
    农民情绪高涨自动清查地主黑地
    【冀中电】安次县委依靠群众，建立了村级人民政权六十个。该县于一月上旬曾检讨了无原则留用敌伪人员的右倾错误，因此在这一段工作的开始，全县即普遍以小区为单位集中伪保甲人员训练；并在群众大会上揭发其罪恶事实，令其登记全部敌伪物资武器和全部敌伪组织人员，对群众则宣布政府是给人民服务的机关，要坚决保障人民利益。与此同时，区干部深入群众，尽可能帮助群众解决一些生产与生活上的困难。在一区城关发现群众因敌人摧垮硝业生活困难，推进社当即贷粮三万斤，组织起四十二户贫苦户，进行熬硝。群众看到政府给人民作主，便自己起来要求推翻伪政权。七区普照营村，区干在年节时深入到贫苦农民家去访问，并帮助他们解决了一些过年的困难。群众从实际中体会到我们对他们的亲切，便敢于提出他们的要求：纷纷探询是否我们还给他们作主分土地。根据群众情绪，分片召开了佃户会，经过阶级教育，群众都要求团结起来，有的自动提出：“谁受地主拉拢就是不愿有饭吃了。”接着便依靠已发现的贫农积极分子，团结多数农民，召开全村群众大会，揭发伪保甲人员罪恶，对其中坏的坚决撤消其职务。并在这一会议上，民主选举新的村政权。这个经验推动了改造政权运动的普遍开展。经过先后一个月的时间，在一百六十七个新解放村中，建立起六十个新村政权。人民取得政权后，情绪极为高涨。洞仇庄群众马上要求发枪，要求自己以武装来监视坏分子的活动，以保卫自己的利益。许多村并掀起了反黑地斗争。红市村群众自由组织了两个小组，讨论地主的黑地，查出地主乔文彬黑地一百七十亩。石槽村地主王德合，投机自报黑地一百五十亩，但当即被贫农查出，迫其报出全部隐蔽之黑地二百七十亩。据七、八区十一个村的初步统计：共反出黑地九千零七十亩。在此段工作中得出四点经验：（一）新区工作中，建立严格的会议、汇报制度十分重要，这样能很快的发现工作中的偏向。一般最容易发生的是顾此失彼：注意建立政权，就忽视清剿武装匪特；顾优军，就忽视对敌伪人员的控制。只有及时汇报检查，才能较快的发现并进行纠正。（二）人民自己掌握政权后，要慎重地建立武装，以防匪特破坏活动。一区建设一个村政权，就建立好一个村武装组织。（三）对新当选干部，要注意多给撑腰与帮助，有些坏分子故意找新干部的岔子，与他们为难，我们应以坚决态度，打击那些坏分子。（四）县区干部一定不能借口房子困难住在地主家里，因新区人民十分注视我们的一言一动。石槽村工作组住在地主家里，群众什么问题也不反映，发觉后才得到纠正。
