[Ji Zhong Electric] In order to launch this year's large-scale production competition movement, the Wenxiang Village Branch of Renhe convened a special meeting to study and mobilize the vast number of women to participate in field production. Based on the past production situation of women in the village, preliminary mobilization methods have now been discussed. Last year, 95 women in the village participated in field production, accounting for 33 percent of the total of 297 young, middle-aged, and elderly women in the village. In addition, 177 women only participated in work on the threshing floor, 18 women were unable to participate in other production due to being burdened by household affairs, and 7 lazy women believed that participating in production was shameful. In order to completely eliminate the ideological obstacles for women to participate in field production, the reasons why most of the women in the village could not participate in field production were specifically analyzed: (1) Some farmers retain backward customs, such as the old tradition that "newly married daughters-in-law are new for three years (meaning that they do no work in the field or on the threshing floor for three years)." Therefore, parents-in-law do not tell their new daughters-in-law to work in the field or on the threshing floor, and the new daughters-in-law themselves have the mentality of being a guest, feeling that it is unfair to work for their in-laws, and become unhappy if asked to do so. (2) Some women themselves despise the role of women's labor. For example, some think: "What can women do in the fields? Anyway, they can't do big things." Based on the above situation, the village branch plans to mobilize more than 50 percent of the village's labor force of women to participate in field production this year. They invited women who are good at labor in the village to hold a forum to discuss production. And the following methods for mobilizing women to participate in field production have been studied: First, explain and educate women and their parents-in-law separately to change the old ideas and traditions of some women not participating in field production. Explain to women: They have been allocated a piece of land, and they should not only do housework, but also work in the fields. Only through labor can women improve their family, social, and political status, and women can only achieve complete liberation through production. Point out that it is shameful for women with labor ability not to participate in field production. Explain to parents-in-law: They should let women work in the fields, even if it's just a little bit. Hoeing the land more often will produce more grain. It is often said: "Cotton is hoeed eight times, peaches are like eggs." In this way, parents-in-law are urged to supervise their own women to go to the fields for production. Second, women who participate in field production should be commended, and their model labor deeds should influence ordinary women; at the same time, rely on them to mobilize other women to participate in production. On this point, special attention should be paid to organizing women's labor mutual aid, because some women are unwilling to work alone in the fields, and they don't know how to do it themselves. Everyone is energetic when they talk and laugh together, and those who don't know how can learn. Third, all women Party members and cadres in the village must take the lead in participating in field production, and only in this way can they lead others.

　　任河文香村支部
  　从改变旧风俗入手
    动员妇女参加田间生产
    【冀中电】为了开展今年大规模生产竞赛运动，任河文香村支部，召开了专门研究发动广大妇女参加田间生产的会议，根据过去该村妇女生产情况，现已讨论出初步动员办法。该村去年参加田间生产的妇女，计有九十五人，占全村青壮老年妇女总数二百九十七人的百分之三十三。另外，只参加做场里活的妇女一百七十七人，被家庭事务所累而不能参加其他生产的妇女十八人，认为参加生产是耻辱的懒惰妇女七人。为彻底扫除妇女参加田间生产的思想障碍，具体分析了该村妇女不能大部参加田间生产的原因：（一）有些农民保留落后习俗，如流行着什么“新娶媳妇新三年，（即三年以内场里地里活完全不做）的旧传统。因此，家长就不说叫新媳妇到场里地里去做活，新媳妇本身也存有做客思想，觉着给婆家做活冤枉，如果叫做就不痛快。（二）有些妇女，自己轻视妇女的劳动作用。如有的认为：“妇女下地能做什么？反正是顶不了大事。”根据以上情况，该村支部今年为发动全村百分之五十以上有劳动力的妇女参加田间生产，邀请全村劳动好的妇女开会座谈生产。并研究出了以下发动妇女参加田间生产的办法：一、对妇女和家长公婆分别进行解释教育，改变某些妇女不参加田间生产的旧思想旧传统。对妇女说明：自己分了一份土地，自己不但做家里活，还要做地里活，只有劳动才能提高妇女的家庭、社会、政治地位，妇女只有在生产中才能求得彻底解放。指出有劳动力的妇女不参加田间生产是耻辱的。对家长说明：应该让妇女到地里去做活，做一点是一点，地多锄一遍，就能多打点粮食，常说：“棉花锄八遍，桃子赛鸡蛋。”这样来使家长督促自己妇女下地生产。二、对参加田间生产的妇女，要进行表扬，以她们的劳动模范事迹，影响一般妇女；同时依靠她们动员别的妇女参加生产。在这一点上，特别要抓紧组织妇女劳动互助，因为有些妇女，不愿一个人在地里做活，自己也不懂怎么做，大伙在一块说说笑笑干着有劲，不会做的又能学活。三、全村妇女党员、干部一定要带领参加田间生产，也只有这样才能领导别人。
