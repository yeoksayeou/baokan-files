[Baoding News] Drug offenders Zheng Yingjie, Liang Chunlin, Zhang Xuewu, Hu Fengbo, and others were arrested by the Baoding City Public Security Bureau and immediately sent to the Baoding City People's Court. Zheng Yingjie confessed that after the liberation of Baoding City, the amount of drugs decreased significantly. In order to profit from it and satisfy his own addiction, he colluded with Zhang Xuewu, Liang Chunlin, and others to entrust unscrupulous merchants to purchase large quantities of drugs. They bought more than 40 taels of raw opium and 9 taels of opium paste in three times. In addition to selling some, 23 taels were still in stock and seized by the government. Liang Chunlin, Zhang Xuewu, and others confessed that since November of last year, they had colluded with unscrupulous merchants several times to transport raw opium from outside. In addition to handing over most of it to Zheng Yingjie for sale, they also sold 11 taels to Hu Fengbo (a drug dealer). After deducting what they consumed, they profited over one million yuan.

After interrogation, the criminals confessed to their crimes. In order to uphold the law, eradicate the prevalence of drugs, and make drug offenders such as Zheng Yingjie repent of their past mistakes, the Baoding City People's Court, in addition to confiscating their drugs according to law, also sentenced them to fixed-term imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes. The sentences were officially pronounced in court on March 9th: Zheng Yingjie was sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment, Liang Chunlin and Zhang Xuewu were sentenced to two years and six months of fixed-term imprisonment, and Hu Fengbo was sentenced to two years of fixed-term imprisonment.
