　　Ping Municipality Tram Revenue Increases Twofold in March
　　[Another News Item] The Beijing (Peiping) Municipal Tram Company, after three months of efforts by all its employees, is now operating 80 trams daily. Currently, it carries approximately 80,000 passengers daily, with ticket sales exceeding 400,000 yuan. This represents a twofold increase compared to the daily ticket sales of 120,000 to 130,000 yuan immediately after liberation. According to the factory's employees, the main reasons for this development are: First, the efforts of all employees, especially the workers in the repair shop, who, under conditions of extreme shortage of tram materials, have tried every means to utilize various waste materials to repair the trams in a timely manner. Secondly, under the leadership of the Communist Party, all institutions and military personnel buy tickets when taking the tram, unlike the unreasonable behavior of institutions and military personnel under the Kuomintang who would ride the tram without paying. Now the workers unanimously say: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the tram industry have the opportunity to develop."

　　平市电车收入三月增加二倍
    【又讯】北平市电车公司，经过三个月来全体职工的努力，每日开出电车已达八十辆，目前每日乘客约八万多人，卖票四十余万元，较刚解放时的每日售票十二、三万元，增多了二倍。据该厂职工谈：目前获得发展的主要原因：第一、全体职工的努力，特别是修理厂的工人，在电车材料异常缺乏的条件下，他们想尽一切办法利用各种废物及时的修理好电车。其次是在共产党领导下，所有的机关、部队人员乘车都买票，不象国民党在时的机关、部队人员蛮横无理坐车不买票。现在工人一致说：“只有在共产党领导下，电车业才会有发展的机会。”
