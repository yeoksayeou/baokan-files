　　【Taihang Electric Message】In order to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing in a planned way, the Neiqiu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an expanded cadre meeting at the beginning of last month to arrange for one and a half months of production work. The meeting focused on the following specific tasks for spring plowing preparation: (1) Immediately mobilize and organize the large-scale accumulation and transportation of manure, explaining that manure is the main condition for increasing production, and organize firewood collection to ensure that every household has no difficulty burning fuel before the wheat harvest. (2) Repair field edges, build field embankments, and harrow the land, especially the small amount of land that was not completely cultivated last autumn, should be cultivated early this spring. Mobilize early to dig wells and repair canals. (3) Water wheat and hoe wheat to ensure the wheat harvest and strive for increased production. (4) Plant more hemp, using all scattered vacant land and field edges. Hemp is an industrial raw material with a wide market and can be used by oneself, increasing fertilizer. (5) Carry out afforestation, publicize its significance and benefits, and establish nurseries of three to five fen of land in each village, requiring each person to plant and keep alive three trees. (6) Breed livestock in large numbers to increase animal power, pay attention to protecting livestock, reward those who specialize in raising stud donkeys and stud cattle, and produce more small livestock. Organize and mobilize the masses to purchase livestock. (7) Repair and add small carts and farm tools.
    【Jizhong Electric Message】In order to actively exert the breeding and promotion tasks of local farms in this year's large-scale production campaign, the Jizhong Administrative Office specially convened a meeting of farm directors on February 12 to discuss and study the promotion plan and tasks before Grain Rain this year: 1. Before the Spring Equinox, each farm should establish a lower-level promotion group to strengthen the guidance of farmers in preventing and eliminating pests, mainly jujube weevils and pear slugs. Last year, the Eighth District experienced a serious outbreak of heartworms. Farmers should be mobilized to chop or burn the corn stalks stored from last year's harvest to eliminate the heartworms lurking in the corn stalks and breed pests in warm weather. In areas where barley is grown, seize the time to mobilize farmers to soak seeds. In this season, it is also necessary to carry out the spring afforestation campaign. 2. Before Grain Rain, millet and sorghum should be prepared for sowing, and seed soaking should be widely promoted. Also, promote the mating of livestock to strengthen breeding. 3. Before the Beginning of Summer, promote hoeing wheat to prevent jaundice, mobilize farmers to plant more cotton, and promote planting in large ridges. 4. Before the Lesser Fullness, if wheat jaundice occurs in some areas, farmers should be mobilized to immediately remove the discovered jaundice seedlings to avoid disaster. At the same time, cotton has reached the seedling setting period, guide farmers to open and set seedlings. In this season, it is also necessary to seize the planning of tree seedling sowing. At present, each farm must complete seed regulation and seed disinfection, and each farm must appropriately distribute various agricultural medicines to the county farms before Qingming Festival to supply the needs of farmers.

  　布置送粪垒堰
    推广优良品种及早防止害虫
    冀中召开农场会议
    【太行电】为了有计划的加强春耕领导，中共内邱县委会于上月初召开全县扩干会议，布置了一个半月的生产工作，着重提出春耕准备的具体工作：（一）立即号召组织大量积肥、运粪，说明粪是增产的主要条件，并组织打柴，做到麦收前家家烧燃不困难。（二）修地边垒地堰、耙地，特别是去秋没有耕完的少数地，今春要提前耕完。趁早动员进行打井、修渠。（三）浇麦、锄麦，保证麦收与争取增产。（四）多种大麻，利用所有零碎空地地边等都种上大麻，大麻是工业原料，销路很广，并能自用，增加肥料。（五）开展植树造林，宣传其意义与好处，每村建立三分至五分地的苗圃，要求每人栽活三棵树。（六）、大量繁殖牲口，增加畜力，注意爱护牲畜，奖励专养种驴种牛，多生小畜。组织发动群众购买牲畜。（七）修理添置小车农具。
    【冀中电】冀中行政公署为了在今年大生产运动中，积极发挥各地农场的繁殖推广任务，特于二月十二日召开了各繁殖场场长会议，讨论研究了今年小满以前的推广计划和任务：一、春分前各场要建立起下层推广组，加强指导农民防除害虫，主要是枣步曲、梨狗子等。八分区去年发生严重的钻心虫灾，应发动农民把去年收成存放的棒子秸铡碎或烧光，免除在棒子秸内潜伏的钻心虫，在暖时蝻繁殖害虫。在种大麦地区，抓紧发动农民浸种。在这一季节还要开展春季造林运动。二、谷雨前谷子高粱即准备播种，要广泛提倡浸种。并提倡牲口的交配加强繁殖。三，立夏前提倡锄麦防黄疸，发动农民多种棉花，提倡种大垄。四、小满前如有发生小麦黄疸的地区，应发动农民将发现了的黄疸苗立时拔除，以免成灾。同时棉花已到定苗时期，指导农民开苗定苗。在这一季节还须抓紧计划树秧播种。目前各农场必须完成种籽调剂和种籽消毒，各场要在清明前将各种农业药品适当分配到各县农场，供给农民需用。
