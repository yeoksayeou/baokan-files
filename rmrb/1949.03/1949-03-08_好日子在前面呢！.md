　　Good Days Are Ahead!
　　Female Worker, Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Mill, Shū Yuán
　　I started working at the No. 6 Cotton Mill when I was fourteen, and it's been more than three years now. In these years, I haven't had a single happy day. I've had so much anger bottled up inside, and I couldn't find anyone to talk to. I always felt stifled. My fellow workers said I sigh too much, that it's bad and shortens your life, but what can I do? I don't dare to speak, so I can only sigh.
　　I was originally a country girl, growing up in the wind and sun, used to simple clothes and food. But after entering the factory, I seemed to forget my roots. I wore Western-style clothes, leather shoes, permed my hair, and put on rouge and lipstick, changing my appearance. But really, who wants to do that!
　　My family of three depends on my wages to survive. We save every penny, and it's still difficult. Where would we get extra money to buy good clothes and cosmetics? When I first entered the factory, I was still dressed like a country girl, in coarse cloth clothes. People looked down on me, especially our foreman, who always rolled his eyes and acted indifferent. Sometimes he would hum a few words: "So rustic..." When my machine broke down and I asked him to fix it, he ignored me several times. Instead, he would hold a cigarette and chat and laugh with those prettily dressed female workers. I was so anxious that I cried, and he said I was stupid, scolded me, scolded me for breaking the machine, and threatened me, saying, "I won't let you operate it anymore." Others also joined in teasing me.
　　I could only tell my mother my troubles. When I cried, she cried too. When I was sad, she was sad too. Mother and daughter, there was nothing we could do but tighten our belts and save on household expenses. So I put on new clothes, leather shoes, and permed my hair. I wasn't used to this kind of dress, as if I had done something wrong. The first day I went to the factory, I didn't dare to raise my head, didn't dare to look at people. I vaguely heard them say, "Clothes make the man, and a saddle makes the horse. Fix yourself up, and you look much better." My face felt hot. When I smelled the scent of cosmetics and heard the sound of leather shoes, I thought of my family's life, and I cried several times again. They say I sigh too much. Living in this kind of world, how could you not sigh?
　　The People's Liberation Army has come. They are working for the benefit of the poor and the oppressed. They wear coarse clothes, eat cornbread, and what they say touches my heart! They said, "We must save raw materials and cherish things. In the past, the factory belonged to a few bureaucrats. Slowing down and wasting things was fighting against the capitalists, which was correct. Now the factory is our own, it belongs to the people." Hearing this, I understood even more that I am now the master of the factory, and I must cherish things even more. Everyone said, "We must work hard, do a good job, and earn more wages." Finally, we've made it through! From now on, honest people can stand up straight. In the past, you couldn't get anywhere without dressing up. That's the way the world was. I don't ridicule my fellow workers either. Who among them has extra money! Now it's good, there's no need to use blood and sweat money to buy cosmetics. Working honestly, no one will laugh at me or mock me anymore. The harder you work, the more you will be respected, and you can even become a labor hero!
　　I am only eighteen years old this year. Good days are still ahead!

### 好日子在前面呢！

　　好日子在前面呢！
    天津中纺第六厂女工  淑媛
    我十四岁就到中纺六厂做工，到现在已经三年多了。这几年当中，就没有痛快过，一肚子气没处出，一肚子话也找不到人说，老是蹩着。和我一起做工的工友们说我爱叹气，不好，要损寿，活不长，我有什么法子呢！有话不敢说，只好叹口气。
    我本来是个乡下人，从小就是风刮日头晒里长大的，粗衣淡饭惯了。但是进了厂以后，我好象忘了本了，穿上洋布衣衫，皮鞋，还烫了头发，抹上一脸胭指口红，变了样了，其实，谁愿意这样做呵！
    家里三口人，都得靠着我的工钱过日子，省吃俭用，还有困难，那里还有多余的钱买好衣服买化妆品呢？在我一进厂时，还是乡下打扮，粗布衣服，人家就瞧不起我，尤其我们那个工头，总是翻着眼睛，爱理不理的样子，有时嘴里还哼一两句：“土里土气……”我的车子坏了，求他修理，好几次他也不管，他却衔着香烟和那些打扮得漂亮的女工说说笑笑，我急得哭了，他还说我笨，骂我，骂我不该把车子开坏了，吓唬我说：“以后不叫你开了。”别人也跟着打趣我。
    我有苦，只能对妈说，我哭她也哭，我难过她也难过，娘儿俩，没有办法，只好勒紧肚子，把家用省了又省，于是我穿上了新衣服、皮鞋，也烫了头发，这样打扮我是不惯的，象做了亏心事一样。第一天到厂里去，我头也不敢抬，眼也不敢看人，耳朵隐约听见他们说：“人有衣衫马要鞍，收拾一下，好看多了。”我脸上热辣辣的。我闻见化妆品的香味，听着皮鞋的响声，就想到家里的生活，我又哭了好几次。他们说我爱叹气，处在这种世道里，你能会不叹气吗？
    解放军来了，他们是为穷人为受压迫的人谋利益的，他们粗衣粗布，吃窝窝头，说的话可碰我的心呢！他们说：“要节省原料，爱惜东西；过去厂子是少数官僚的，磨洋工糟踏东西，是向资本家做斗争，是正确的。现在工厂是我们自己的了，是人民的了。”这一说，我更明白了，我自己现在成了工厂的主人，我也要更爱惜东西。大家说：“要努力生产，好好做工，多做活多得工资。”这下，可算熬出来了，以后我们老实人可以出头了。过去不打扮就吃不开，世道是那种样，我也不耻笑我的工友们，他们谁又有多余的钱呢！现在好了，用不着拿血汗钱去买化妆品了，老老实实的干活，也没人会笑我会讽刺我了。越努力越会受人尊敬，还能当劳动英雄哩！
    今年我才十八岁，好日子还在前面呢！
