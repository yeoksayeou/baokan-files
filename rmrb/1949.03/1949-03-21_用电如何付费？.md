How to Pay for Electricity?
    Reply from Jibei Electric Power Company to Readers in Beiping City
    Regarding the procedures for users of Jibei Electric Power Company's Beiping Branch to pay for electricity, many readers have written to inquire. Our newspaper reporter visited the person in charge of the company, who provided the following answers:
    Q: How does the company settle electricity bills for users who are supplied with electricity?
    A: For users with electricity meters, it is calculated according to the meter readings (i.e., kilowatt-hours). For package-deal users without electricity meters, it is calculated according to the size of the light bulbs installed. Settlements are made monthly.
    Q: What is the prescribed procedure for charging fees?
    A: Each month, the company sends personnel to the location where the user's meter is installed to record the meter reading. They calculate the user's electricity consumption from the previous month to the current month. The meter reader records the reading on the meter reading sheet and also writes the same record on the user's electricity consumption record card for future reference. The next day, they begin to classify and calculate the electricity price according to the approved rates, prepare receipts, and on the fifth day after the meter reading, they send collectors to each user's location to collect the electricity fee.
    Q: What should a user do if they do not have enough money at the time and cannot pay the collector?
    A: If the user cannot pay at that time, the collector will leave a "Notice of Electricity Fee" to the user, asking the user to bring the payment to the company within seven days (as clearly stated on the notice). The company will not send anyone to collect the payment again.
    Q: Why does the company only send someone to collect payment once a month?
    A: The company is very willing to send people to the user's location to collect payment multiple times, but because there are more than 120,000 users in the city, and the company only has more than 50 field collection personnel, each person would have to visit more than 2,000 households per month on average. Moreover, the area is very large, and it is really beyond our capacity to make multiple visits for collection. If you say, then adding people would be good, adding people is certainly a solution, but the result of adding people is that the company's expenses must increase, and the increase in expenses will affect the electricity price, resulting in an increased burden on users. The company's purpose is to serve the people, and it is unwilling to increase the burden on users unless necessary.
    Q: Then what should be done if the user still does not pay the electricity bill after seven days?
    A: If the user does not pay the electricity bill after seven days, the company has no choice but to temporarily suspend the electricity supply to the user in arrears in order to maintain the electricity supply to other users.
    Q: After the electricity supply is suspended, can it be restored?
    A: Within five days from the date of suspension, the user can come to the company to pay the outstanding fee, and also pay the reconnection fee and replenish the electricity deposit to the amount of the current electricity deposit before the electricity supply can be restored. If the payment is not made within five days, then the meter will be removed. After the meter is removed, if electricity is needed again, it must be handled according to the procedures for new users.
    Q: Why does the company stipulate that electricity will be cut off if the payment is overdue for seven days?
    A: Before answering this question, I want to state that the company's purpose is to supply electricity, not to cut off electricity. Therefore, from the company's point of view, it is absolutely unwilling and cannot arbitrarily cut off the electricity of any user. The act of cutting off electricity due to user arrears is very much a last resort. Although the company stipulates that the payment date is only seven days, but in reality, from the meter reading date of the previous month to the meter reading date of the current month is one month, from the meter reading to the date of sending personnel to collect fees is five days, plus the seven-day user self-payment period, it is a total of one month and thirteen days. Ordinary transactions are "cash on delivery," and the "market price can vary from morning to evening." The company's business method is different. Of course, our company is a public utility and should not be compared with general commercial operations. However, to advance fuel, salaries, and other expenses for more than a month, according to the current situation, if the average monthly electricity bill for each user is 600 yuan, it would be necessary to advance more than 70 million yuan. Including the payment period, it would be necessary to advance more than 100 million yuan. This is referring to no arrears. If there are any arrears, then the amount of advance will be even greater. The current electricity price is already low. If the deadline is extended further, how can it be maintained, and how can the users who are in arrears face the users who pay on time?
    Q: What is the recent situation of the company's handling of power outages due to arrears?
    A: In the past, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was not uncommon for many military and government agencies or privileged classes to refuse to pay, and even tear up receipts and beat and scold employees. Therefore, the fee collection system could not proceed as stipulated. After the liberation of Beiping, this phenomenon gradually decreased. Recently, although some users have still encountered power outages due to arrears, after the company's detailed explanation, users understand that public utilities are closely related to each user, and the company is now the property of the people themselves, and the people should especially cherish it in order to fully develop the company's business. If the company's business can develop rationally, the users will naturally benefit. Therefore, the general users believe that the company's payment deadline and the measures for handling power outages due to arrears should be done this way, and they all follow the company's regulations to handle the reconnection of electricity.
    Q: How many electricity fee collection agencies does the company have?
    A: There are now four in the city, and the locations of the four are clearly written on the "Notice of Electricity Fee." In addition, we originally entrusted the China Communications and Jiao Tong Banks to collect electricity fees on our behalf. Now that the two banks have been reorganized, we are in contact with the People's Bank to resume the collection agency soon. In addition to handling fee collection during business hours every day, the company and the business stations in the East, West, and South cities also collect fees on Sundays to facilitate public officials and professional personnel who cannot make payments on ordinary days. However, it is best to ask users to prepare the electricity bill after the meter reading and give it to the collector when the collector comes to collect the fee, which saves the trouble of traveling to pay the fee yourself, and also avoids the power outage due to forgetting. Regarding the issue of electricity payment for the People's Liberation Army borrowing civilian housing for mixed use, the People's Liberation Army absolutely adheres to the principle of "not taking a single needle or thread from the people" and pays reasonably in accordance with the company's regulations. The company is currently negotiating with the relevant authorities, and the measures will be announced soon.

　　用电如何付费？
    冀北电力公司答复北平市读者
    关于冀北电力公司北平分公司办理用户用电付费手续，不少读者写信来问。经本社记者往访该公司负责人，承答复如下：
    问：公司供给用户用电的电费是怎样结算的？
    答：装电表的用户，照电表走的字码（即电度）计算，没有装电表的包灯用户，是照所装灯泡光度的大小来计算，都是每月结算一次。
    问：收费的程序是怎样规定的？
    答：由公司每月派员按期到用户装表的地方抄录电表字码一次，结出上月到这月用户用电度数，由抄表员一面在抄表片上记录下来，同时在留存用户的用电记录卡片上也写上同样的记录，以备用户查对，第二天就开始照核定的电价分类计算，做好收据，在抄表后的第五天，就派出收费员挨户到用户用电的地方收取电费。
    问：如果用户当时因为备款不齐，不能交给收费员时，应该怎么办呢？
    答：倘或用户当时不能付款，就由收费员留下一张“电费通知单”交给用户，要请用户在七天之内（通知单上写明白的）自行持款到公司交款，公司不再派人上门收款。
    问：公司为什么每月只能派人取款一次呢？
    答：公司很愿意派人到用户用电的地方多次取款，但因为全市有十二万多用户，公司外勤收费人员仅有五十多人，平均每人每月收一次的话，就要跑两千多户，并且地区很大，多次上门取款，实在是力所不及，假如说，那么添人办好了，添人固然是个办法，可是添人的结果，公司开支一定要增加，开支增加，就会影响电价，结果是给用户增加负担，公司是以服务人民为目的的，除非必要，是不愿意随便增加用户负担的。
    问：那么用户过了七天，仍不交付电费，应如何处理呢？
    答：假如用户过了七天没有把电费交清，公司为了维持其他用户的供电，只有暂行停止欠费用户的供电。
    问：停止供电之后，是不是可以恢复用电？
    答：在停止供电日起，五天以内，用户可以到公司除把欠费缴清外，并要缴付复电费及按照当时电费保证金数额补足电费保证金后，才能恢复供电。如果五天之内不来缴费，那么就要拆回电表，电表拆回之后，再要用电，就得按新用户手续办理。
    问：公司为什么要规定欠费过七天就停电？
    答：在没有答复这个问题之前，先要声明一下，就是公司是以供电为目的，不是以停止供电为目的，因此在公司立场上言，绝对不愿意也不能随便停某一个用户的电。因用户欠费而停电之举，是非常不得已的。又公司规定收费日期虽只七天，但实在计算起来，从上个月抄表日起到本月抄表日止是一个月，从抄表后到派员取费日有五天，再加上七天用户自己缴费期限一共就有一个月零十三天，普通交易都是当埸“银货两讫”方式，并且可以“早晚市价不同”，公司的营业方式是不同，固然本公司是公用事业，不应该拿一般商业经营方式来论，可是垫支一个多月的燃料薪工以及其他开支，依现在情形，假如每个用户每月电费平均六百元，即要垫出七千余万元，连收费期限算起来，就要垫支一亿元以上。这是指没有欠费而言，如果其中再有欠费的，那么垫支数目必更大。现在的电价已经低了，试问若再要拖长日期，怎么维持，而欠费的用户又怎么对得起如期付费的用户。
    问：最近公司处理欠费停电情形怎样？
    答：以往因为在国民党反动派统治时期，很多军政机关或是特权阶级，拒绝付费的事屡见不鲜，甚而至于撕毁收据，打骂员工的事，也层出不穷，因此收费制度，不能按规定进行。北平解放之后，这种现象就慢慢的减少了。最近虽然有的用户仍然碰到因欠费而停电，可是经过公司详细解释之后，用户都了解公用事业是与每个用户有着密切的关系的，公司现在是人民自己的财产了，人民自应特别加以爱护，才能使公司业务充分发展，公司业务能够合理的发展，得到便利的，自然就是用户，因此一般用户对于公司收费期限以及处理欠费停电措施，全认为应该这么做，并且都照着公司的规定办理复电。
    问：公司收电费的机构有几处？
    答：现在在市内有四处，四处的地点在“电费通知单”上都写明白，此外过去本来委托中国交通两银行代收电费，现在因为两行已改组，正在向人民银行接洽预计不久就可以恢复代收，又公司及东、西、南城各营业站，除了每天在营业时间内办理收费外；为了便利公教职业人员不能在平常日子里交款的，星期天也照常收款，不过最好是请用户于抄表之后，把电费准备好，在收费员上门取费的时候，交给收费员，一来省去自行交费跋涉之劳，二来免得因遗忘而停电。又关于解放军借住民房混合用电付费问题，解放军绝对在“不取民间一针一线”原则之下，一律按照公司规章合理付费，现在公司正与有关当局洽商，不久就可以公告办法。
