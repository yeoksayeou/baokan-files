    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. TASS, The Hague: The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party held a meeting in Amsterdam on March 7th. The General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, De Groot, spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the United States is accelerating its war preparations. De Groot declared: The Dutch Communist Party fully agrees with the opinions expressed by Thorez and Togliatti: if the Soviet army is forced to pursue imperialist aggressors into their country, the masses of their countries will give assistance to the Soviet army. Let the Dutch imperialists know that if the American and British aggressors and their lackeys start an anti-Soviet war, Amsterdam will follow the example of the workers of Paris and Rome. De Groot concluded: We do not want war. We will do everything in our power to prevent the imperialists from launching a war. We must first extinguish the flames of war in Indonesia.
