　　My Relationship with Acupuncture
　　Zhu Lian
　　The medical art of acupuncture can indeed cure diseases. My impression of this was profound from childhood, because it saved my grandmother from death and cured my brother's cholera. However, due to the influence of feudal and backward thinking at the time, I always thought it was a profession for "lower-class people" like barbers and back-scrubbers, not worth learning. Later, after studying and practicing medicine for more than ten years, I was always too busy with medical work to ever think about learning it.
　　In October 1944, Yan'an held a Cultural and Educational Conference. Chairman Mao pointed out a clear path for cultural and educational work at this meeting. He said: "The people generally believe in witches and gods. In this situation, it is impossible to rely solely on a few Western doctors in the organs and troops. Serving the organs and troops is very important, and Western medicine is more scientific than traditional Chinese medicine, but if Western doctors in this situation do not care about the people, do not train more Western doctors for the people in the border area, and do not unite and help transform the thousand traditional Chinese doctors and old-fashioned veterinarians in the border area, they are actually helping witches and gods, helping the people in the border area to die." After this, at a symposium of Chinese and Western doctors convened by the border area government, an old gentleman named Ren Zuotian, who was over sixty years old, volunteered to provide his thirty years of experience in acupuncture practice, hoping that the Western medical community would study its principles in depth. After Mr. Ren finished speaking, some comrades in Western medicine initiated a signature campaign to apprentice to him. I signed up at the time, but never had the opportunity to become a disciple.
　　In April of the following year, I went to the Peace Hospital for medical treatment because of illness. After a few days, I recovered and was recuperating in the hospital. One day, the院长 [Yuàn zhǎng - hospital director] Lu Zhijun asked me with a smile: "Are you feeling better? Tomorrow we will start experimenting with acupuncture in the clinic. Are you happy to participate?" Only then did I know that he had already gone to Mr. Ren's place for fourteen days, learned some techniques, copied a manual, and drawn a few meridian point charts. At the time, I felt that the opportunity was very good, so I gladly agreed. However, I still held a skeptical attitude, thinking that the hospital was full of chronic diseases that were difficult to treat effectively under existing medical conditions, and therefore acupuncture was being tried. However, after implementing acupuncture, things became more and more complex, even making people stunned and unable to explain:
　　A regimental commander who had suffered a gunshot wound had urinary incontinence and often urinated in bed or in his pants. One of his legs was numb. When acupuncture began, only the good leg had an electric shock-like sensation. Acupuncture was performed once every day or every other day, each time targeting two points on the opposite side. Later, the diseased leg also had a tingling, aching, and heavy sensation, and the degree of urinary incontinence was also reduced significantly. Once, when acupuncturing the Gaohuang point on the back, the regimental commander fainted immediately due to nerve stimulation. His jaws were clenched, his limbs were cold, and he was sweating. The needle at the Gaohuang point was not removed, and another needle was inserted at the Renzhong point. He immediately woke up, feeling as comfortable as if he had slept for a long time. I remember that in addition to acupuncturing the Gaohuang and Renzhong points, he also needled the 八＠ [bā ＠ - unclear what this refers to, possibly 八髎穴 - Eight sacral points] on the sacrum and the Weiyang, Yanglingquan, and Zusanli points on the legs.
　　There was also a working cadre in the hospital who suffered from night blindness. The condition had been present for quite some time. On cloudy days or in dimly lit places or when it was getting dark, he could not only not read or write, but he could not even see large trees one by one. From the day of acupuncture, I paid full attention to the changes in his eyesight, running to ask him every morning how he felt the previous evening. To my surprise, the first time I needled Jingming and 瞳子＠ [tóng zǐ ＠ - unclear what this refers to, possibly 瞳子髎 - Pupil Crevice], he could see the trees clearly at dusk. The second time I needled Zanzhu and Sizhukong, he could see the large headline characters on the newspaper at night. The third time I needled Yuyao and Sibai, he could see the characters with fewer strokes on the newspaper. The fourth time I needled Shangxing and Yangbai, he was able to read the newspaper at night, but his eyes felt a little tired. Later, the above-mentioned points were needled repeatedly every other day for about ten days, and he was completely cured from then on. Whenever I heard him talk about the progress of his eyesight, I couldn't help but marvel, because in Western medicine, night blindness is keratomalacia, and its cause is malnutrition and lack of vitamin A. To treat this disease, according to Western medicine books, the first thing to pay attention to is nutrition, and to eat foods such as milk, eggs, animal meat, fresh fish, cod liver oil... but he only had two meals of millet porridge and melon and vegetable dishes every day, and his diet did not improve. How could acupuncture be so effective? I discussed it with Director Lu, and he was also amazed.
　　Curing one person led to ten, and ten led to a hundred. More and more patients came. In the past, not many rural people came to the Peace Hospital for treatment. They were afraid of taking Western medicine, getting injections, and having operations. They dared not come unless it was absolutely necessary. But now there were many. Among the farmers, some suffered from year-round diarrhea (habitual diarrhea), and some had bowel movements only four or five times a month (habitual constipation), as well as many other ailments. Without spending a penny and without taking any medicine, they were cured after acupuncture treatment. One patient was carried in lying on a door panel, curled up into a ball. When he was helped up, he was still pressing his hands on his stomach, tightly furrowing his brows and crying in pain. A diagnosis was made of gastric neuralgia. A needle was inserted into the Zusanli point on both of his lower legs. The patient's brows immediately unfurrowed, and his hands no longer pressed on his stomach. Another needle was inserted four inches above the navel—called the Zhongwan point. The patient breathed a sigh of relief, "Magic needle! Magic needle! It doesn't hurt at all." The patient said, laughing, and carried the door panel back himself.
　　In mid-August of that year, because I went to listen to two reports by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, I waded back and forth four times in the Yan River, where the water was knee-deep. After that, I felt some pain and fatigue in my waist and hips, my legs were heavy, and my heels were also a little swollen and painful. At first, it was less painful when I walked less, but after five or six days, it hurt badly even when I didn't walk. From the waist and hips, the back of the thighs, the outside and back of the calves, all the way to the heels and insteps, the pain was unbearably burning, scorching, drilling, and stabbing, especially at night, the pain was so bad that I couldn't sleep. According to this situation, it was undoubtedly sciatica caused by catching a cold. Doctors nearby came to see me and unanimously diagnosed it as sciatica. So I took painkillers, got injections of painkillers, hot compresses, rubbed camphor alcohol..., tried all kinds of methods, but they only provided temporary relief. I couldn't sleep for three whole nights. At this time, I suddenly thought of acupuncture. I immediately sent someone to the Peace Hospital to borrow gold needles from Director Lu. By the time they were borrowed, it was dusk, and the severe pain was just beginning. No one knew how to needle me, so I did it myself, asking someone to hold the lamp and watch the clock, telling him to tell me to remove the needle after fifteen minutes: the needle was the Huantiao point on the right side of the buttocks, because it was more convenient to move my right hand when needling myself. When the needle went in about two inches, I felt like I had been electrocuted, running all the way from the buttocks to the calves, and there was also a sensation on the instep. I gently twisted the spiral handle of the needle a few times with my thumb and forefinger, and unknowingly fell asleep. After fifteen minutes, I was awakened to remove the needle. At this time, the burning, scorching, drilling, and stabbing pain had vanished. The next day, fearing that the pain would recur, I needled the Huantiao point on the left buttock and the Neiting point on both insteps. This treatment experience told me that moxibustion is not necessarily required after acupuncture. Fortunately, Director Lu wrote a letter explaining that he was sending me two needles. From then on, I had this tool.
　　After this, the more cases I encountered where one needle was effective, the more difficult it became for me to explain. For example, Comrade Zhang Huayi had been suffering from the problem of drooling at night for many years. His pillow would be wet with a large patch every day. After one acupuncture session at the Hegu point, he was cured. Another example is Comrade Ma Danshan. He told me that he went out on a snowy, windy morning half a month ago, and since then, half of his face has often felt cold. When he gargled with water, the water would come out of half of his lips. I took a closer look, and his mouth was slightly slanted to the right. At that time, I diagnosed it as facial nerve spasm. If it developed, his mouth and eyes would twitch. He wanted me to give him acupuncture. I said I wasn't sure, but I could try it out. So I needled the Dicang points on both sides of his mouth, and the Jiache point on the right side of his jaw. After about ten minutes, the needles were removed. Comrade Ma gargled with water again, and not a drop of water came out. I looked at his face carefully again, and others looked at it too. He also looked in the mirror. His mouth wasn't slanted. Hey! The people in the room were all shocked. Some tapped the table with their fingers, and some applauded. This one asked what the reason was? That one asked what the reason was? I was also asking myself what the reason was? At this time, I wanted to find a book, but I couldn't find one. I went to ask a traditional Chinese medicine doctor who knew acupuncture. They thought that to understand acupuncture, one must be familiar with methods such as "Yin-Yang diagnosis," "Midnight-Midday Ebb-Flow," and "Nine Reinforcements and Six Reductions." I talked to Western doctors, and there were two kinds of answers: one was that it was worth studying, and that if it could cure diseases, there must be a scientific reason, but they didn't have time to study it now. The other was: what, there is such a thing? And then they didn't express any opinions. Pondering and distressed, I finally made a decision for myself: I declared that regardless of whether the theory made sense or not, I would do it as long as it could cure diseases. Therefore, I set a work task among the medical staff of a hospital and a clinic where I worked, requiring everyone to learn acupuncture techniques.
　　Since then, in the three years from 1946 to the present, although I have not achieved any results in acupuncture work, the comrades' hopes and help for me have become more and more enthusiastic, constantly pushing me to study. Also, thanks to the comrades for collecting some medical books on acupuncture for me, so that I can study the scientific principles of acupuncture.
　　Up to now, I have come to the following conclusions in my research on acupuncture: 1. The ancient Chinese acupuncture points are based on the fourteen meridians, namely the three Yin meridians of the hand, the three Yin meridians of the foot, the three Yang meridians of the hand, the three Yang meridians of the foot, and the Ren and Du meridians in front of the chest and behind the back. Some places conform to scientific human anatomy, while others are inevitably far-fetched. The acupoints advocated by Japanese medical scientists are of course more scientific, but denying the meridian points of the fourteen meridians is too much of an accommodation to the general anatomy of muscles and bones, and there are also discrepancies with nerve distribution. Therefore, we must study its physiological acupoints and their functions with more scientific methods. 2. Chinese acupuncture is based on acupuncture followed by moxibustion (moxibustion means twisting artemisia into moxa sticks and burning them on the acupoint that has been needled). Among the four hundred or so acupoints in the human body, only a few can be needled but not moxibusted, or moxibusted but not needled. There are also a few acupoints that are forbidden to be needled and moxibusted. It is divided into acupuncture to treat internal diseases and moxibustion to treat external diseases; and Japanese enthusiasts in acupuncture medicine research are divided into acupuncture science and moxibustion science, both of which have the effect of treating internal and external diseases; however, according to our experience here, some diseases can be treated with acupuncture and moxibustion at the same time, some diseases can be treated with acupuncture alone, some diseases can be treated with moxibustion alone, and even some diseases can only be cured with acupuncture, moxibustion and medicine, and in some forbidden acupoints, according to the anatomical location, acupuncture and moxibustion can also be performed. If we can find out its principle, acupuncture will be more widely used. 3. Acupuncture therapy can treat gastrointestinal neuralgia, acute and chronic gastroenteritis, habitual constipation, habitual diarrhea, and other chronic diseases and neurasthenia, because it can indeed regulate the antagonistic effect of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and can adjust the conduction effect of cerebrospinal nerves and sensory and motor nerves. It can proliferate red blood cells, white blood cells and lymphocytes in the body and strengthen resistance. In the treatment, I used physical and chemical coordination experiments to prove this point. Other aspects, such as acupuncture also plays a great role in helping diagnosis, but some acupuncturists regard acupuncture as a panacea for treating diseases, which is wrong. According to my experience, some diseases can be cured with acupuncture, some diseases can be alleviated, but some acupuncture is ineffective. These issues will not be discussed in detail in this article, but will be discussed in a special article. In order to improve the scientific theory and improve the technology of the historical heritage of Chinese acupuncture medicine for thousands of years, it is hoped that more Western medicine colleagues will participate in this research.

　　我与针灸术
    朱琏
    针灸医术确能治病，我在幼年时，印象就很深刻。因为它曾挽救过祖母的死亡，针好了哥哥的霍乱。但因当时受封建落后思想的影响，总以为是“下流人”剃头老、擦背老的行业，值不得我们去学习。以后学医行医十多年，又因忙于医疗工作，也从来没有想起过要去学它。
    一九四四年十月，延安召开文教大会，毛主席在这个会上对文教工作指出了鲜明的道路，他说：“人民相当普遍相信巫神，在这种情形下，仅仅依靠少数机关部队的西医是不可能的。为机关部队服务是很重要，西医比中医是更科学，但西医在这种情形下不关心人民，不为边区人民训练更多的西医，不联合和帮助改造边区的一千个中医和旧式的兽医，就是实际上帮助巫神，帮助边区人民的死亡。”这以后，在边区政府召开的中西医生座谈会上，有一位六十多岁的任作田老先生，自愿把他三十多年针灸行医的经验，提供出来，希望西医界深入研究它的道理。任老先生一讲完，西医中就有同志发起签名，拜他为老师，当时我也签了名。可是，一直没有机会去当弟子。
    第二年的四月，我因病去和平医院医治，不几天，病好了，住院休养。有一天，院长鲁之俊同志笑嘻嘻的问我：“精神好起来了吧，明天我们开始在门诊室实验针灸，你高兴参加么？”这时我才知道他已经去过任老先生那边十四天，学了学手法，抄了个手本，画了几张经穴图。当时我觉得机会很好，就欣然同意了。但仍抱着怀疑态度，以为病院里都是些慢性病，在现有医药条件下不易收效，因而才试用针灸。然而实行针灸以后，事情越来越复杂，甚至使人目瞪口呆，无法解释了：
    一位受过枪伤的团长，小便失禁，常常尿在床上或裤子里，有一条腿是麻木不仁的，开始针灸时，只是好腿有触电样的感觉，每天或隔一天针灸一次，每次针相对侧的两个穴，后来病腿也有发麻发酸困的感觉，小便失禁的程度也减轻多了；有一次针背部的膏肓穴，这位团长因神经的刺激立刻发了昏，牙关紧闭，四肢发冷，出冷汗，膏肓穴的针并没有起出，又在人中穴进了一针，他就立刻苏醒过来，觉得象睡了多时那样舒服。我记得，他除针灸膏肓穴和人中穴以外，还针了荐骨部的八＠和腿上的委阳、阳陵泉、足三里穴等。
    还有一位该院的工作干部，患夜盲症，日子已经不浅了，一到阴天或光线微弱的地方或天将黑未黑的时候，不仅不能读书写字，连一棵一棵的大树都看不见。从扎针那天起，我用全付精神注意他目力的变化，每天清晨跑去问他头天黄昏感觉如何，哪知第一次针睛明、瞳子＠，天黑时，他看得清树了；第二次针攒竹、丝竹空，他晚上能看到报上的大标题字了；第三次针鱼腰、四白，他看到报上笔划少的字了；第四次针上星、阳白，他能够在晚上看报了，只是眼睛觉得困乏些。以后又每隔一日重复针上述的各穴针了约十天，从此就完全好了。我每当听到他讲目力进展情形的时候，都禁不住啧啧称怪，因为在西医说来，夜盲症就是眼角膜软化症，它的原因是营养不良、缺乏维生素甲，要治疗这个病，按西医书上说，首当注意营养，要吃牛乳、鸡蛋、兽肉、鲜鱼、鱼肝油………等食物，可是他每天只两顿小米饭和瓜条菜，饮食并未改善，怎么针灸治疗就这样顶事呢？和鲁院长研究，他也是惊奇不休。
    治好一个人，就一传十，十传百，病人越来越多了，过去到和平医院来治病的，农村群众并不多，他们害怕吃西药，打洋针，开肚子，非到万不得已不敢上门，这一会可就多啦，农民中有患终年拉肚子的（习惯性腹泻），也有一个月只大便四五次的（习惯性便秘），还有其他许多病症，没有化一个钱，没有吃一点药，针治后就好了。有一个病人躺在门板上缩成一团的抬来，扶起他来，两支手还压住肚子，紧紧的绉住眉头叫痛。一诊断是胃神经痛，在他两支小腿上的三里穴，一边扎下一针，病人立刻眉眼开了，手也不压肚子了，又在脐上四寸的地方下一针——叫中脘穴。病人更松了一口气，“神针！神针！一点不痛啦。”病人说着笑着，自己扛着门板回去了。
    这年八月中旬，因为去听毛主席和朱总司令的两次报告，我在水深过膝的延河里，来回淌了四次，这以后腰部到臀部觉得有些疼痛困乏，两条腿沉重，脚跟也有些胀痛。起初还是少走些路痛得轻些，五六天以后，不走路也痛得历害了，从腰部臀部、大腿后侧、小腿外侧及后面、一直到脚跟脚背，痛得如烧如灼如钻如刺的不可忍耐，尤其是晚上痛得不能入睡。按这情形，无疑的是因受凉而起的坐骨神经痛。附近的医生都来看我，一致诊断为坐骨神经痛。于是吃止痛药啦、注射止痛针啦、热罨包啦、擦樟脑酒啦……，想尽各种办法，都只能一时的稍减疼痛，我整个三晚上没有入睡了，这时，才忽然想起了针灸，马上派人去和平医院向鲁院长借金针，借回来时，已是黄昏，疼痛的剧烈也正开始，没有人会给我扎，我就自己来扎，叫别人照着灯看着表，告诉他入针十五分钟后叫我起针：针的是右侧臀部环跳穴，因自己给自己针，右手动作方便。进针约二寸，腿就感觉象触了电，从臀部一直贯通到小腿，脚背上也有感觉，我用姆指食指在针的螺旋把上轻微的捻动了几下，不知不觉的就睡着了。十五分钟了，我被叫醒起针，这时如烧如灼如钻如刺的难受劲烟消云散了。第二天怕疼痛再发，又针了左侧臀部的环跳穴和两脚背的内庭穴。这一次的治疗经验告诉我，在针刺后不一定要用艾灸。多蒙鲁院长来信说明送我两根针，从此我就有了这个工具。
    这以后我遇到一针见效的病越多，我就越困难解释了。例如：张化夷同志，多年来患夜间流口水的病，每天枕头上要湿一大块，针了一次合谷穴，就好了。又例如：马淡山同志，他告诉我，半月前在雪天刮风的早晨出门，以后半边脸常觉发冷。含水漱口，水就由半边嘴唇冒出来，我仔细一看、他的嘴稍微的右侧歪斜，当时诊断为颅面神经挛痉，发展下去嘴和眼都会抽动的，他要我扎针，我说没有把握，可以试探试探，就在嘴角两旁针地仓穴，又向右侧颚部针颊车穴，约十多分钟，起了针，马同志再含水漱口，一滴水都不往外冒了，我再仔细看他的脸，别人也看，他自己也照镜子，嘴不歪斜了。嘿！屋子里的人都震动开了，有的用手指头敲桌子，有的在鼓掌，这个问什么道理？那个问什么道理？我心里也在问什么道理？这时我想找书，可是找不到，去请教能针灸的中医先生，他们又认为要懂针灸，必需熟悉“阴阳辨症”“子午流注”“九补六泻”等方法。和西医去谈论谈论吧，得到的回答有两种：一种是认为值得研究，既能治病就一定有科学道理，可是现在没时间去研究。另一种是：啥，有这个事情？不发表任何意见。徘徊苦恼，最后自己给自己下了个决心：声明不管他理论通不通，能治好病就干起来再说。于是就在我工作的一个医院和一个门诊部的医务人员中定为一个工作任务，要大家学会针灸的技术。
    这以后，一九四六年到现在的三年中，虽说我在针灸工作上，还没有弄出什么成绩来，可是同志们对我的希望和帮助却热切起来，不断的推动我研究。又承同志们给我搜集了一些关于针灸术的医学书籍，使我能够研究针灸方面的科学道理。
    到现在为止，我在研究针灸中得出这样几个问题：一、中国古代针灸穴位根据十四经，即是分手三阴、足三阴、手三阳、足三阳和胸前背后的任脉督脉为十四经，有些地方是合乎科学的人体解剖，有些就不免牵强附会；而日本医学家提倡孔穴，当然是更科学些，但否定十四经经穴，又未免太迁就肌肉与骨骼的一般解剖，与神经分布也有出入。因此我们必须以更科学的方法去研究它在生理上的穴位及其作用。二、中国针灸，是以针后再灸（灸，就是用艾捻成艾柱，放在已针过的针孔部燃烧的意思），在人体四百左右的穴，仅少许能针不能灸或能灸不能针，也有少许穴是禁针禁灸的；又把它分成针刺治内症，艾灸治外症；而日本热心于针灸医学者的研究，分为针科学与灸科学，两者各有治内外各症的效用；可是，在我们这里的经验，有的病可以针灸同时并用，有的病单独针刺即可，有的病单独艾灸有效，甚至有的病以针灸与药物配合治疗，才能达到治愈目的，而且在有些禁针禁灸的孔穴，根据解剖部位，同样能针能灸。如果我们能求出它的原理，将会使针灸学得到更广泛的运用。三、针灸疗法所以能治胃肠神经痛、急慢性胃肠炎、习惯性便秘、习惯性腹泻、以及其他慢性病和神经衰弱等症，是因它确能调节交感神经与副交感神经的拮抗作用，能调整脑脊神经与知觉神经、运动神经的传导作用，它能增殖体内的赤血球、白血球与淋巴球，加强抵抗力，在治病中我用物理化学的配合实验证明了这点。其他如针灸在帮助诊断上也有很大的作用，但有些针灸术者以针灸治病为万能，这是不对的。据我的经验，有些病能针到病除，有些病可减轻病症，但也有针灸无效的。这些问题，本文不作详谈，以待专篇论及。为了将中国几千年来的针灸医学的历史遗产，提高其科学理论并改进技术，希望西医同仁有更多的人来参加这个研究。（附图片）
