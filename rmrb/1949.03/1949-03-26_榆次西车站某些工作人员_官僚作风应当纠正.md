　　Yuchi West Railway Station Certain Staff Members' Bureaucratic Work Style Should Be Corrected
To the Editor:
    On March 8th, we took the train to Pingyao. At the Yuchi West Railway Station, we witnessed firsthand that it was already past 6 o'clock, the departure bell had rung, and the locomotive in front was continuously sounding its horn to urge departure. However, several dozen villagers and military personnel, holding tickets and pointing at their luggage, ran from the south end of the train to the north end, and then back from the north end to the south end. They went back and forth several times, sweat pouring down their faces, their eyes frantic, as if they were about to pop out, but they still couldn't get on the train. We were among them at the time. During this period, the staff members beside the train were holding small sticks, striding around with square steps, swaggering back and forth, completely ignoring them. The villagers who couldn't get on the train asked them: "Comrades, what should we do if we can't get on the train?" They shook their heads and replied: "Find the station!" The villagers asked again: "Which comrade at the station should we find?" They impatiently replied: "Just find the station!" The villagers said: "They don't care. Please help us find a seat." They put on airs and said: "How can we lead you all?" After several pleas were ineffective, the villagers said in unison: "Then we'll just get on this train!" They immediately replied fiercely: "No, this is an office car." Later, another comrade saw this and helped the villagers onto the train.
    We think: This attitude of neither pointing out the person in charge, nor helping to solve the problem, and not caring whether they can get on the train, is completely a bureaucratic and vile work style from the enemy and puppet period. It is completely inconsistent with the work style of revolutionary staff members. We hope that Yuchi West Railway Station will examine and correct this.

　　榆次西车站某些工作人员  官僚作风应当纠正编辑同志：
    三月八日我们乘火车到平遥，在榆次的西车站亲眼看到，六点钟已过，开车铃已响，火车头也在前面不住声的叫着摧促开车，但车前却有数十个老乡与军人工作人员拿着票，指着行李，从车南头跑到北头，又从车北头返回南头，曾往返向次，头上汗淋淋流下，两眼也急得眼珠快掉出来，但总是上不了车。当时我们也是其中之一，在这当儿，站上车旁的工作人员却拿着小棍迈着方字步，摇摇摆摆的幌来幌去，毫不理会，上不了车的诸老乡问他们：同志上不了车怎么办？他们就把头一摇答道：“找站上吗！”老乡又问：“找站上哪一个同志哩！”他们又不耐烦的答道：“就找站上吗”！老乡说：“找人家不管，请你们帮助我们找个座好吗？”他们却摆着架子又说：“我们都领你们那还行吗？”老乡几次哀求无效，就齐声说道：“那我们就上这个车吧！”他们马上恶狠狠的答道：“不行，这是办公车。”后有另一个同志见到才领老乡上了车。
    我们想：这种既不指给负责人，又不帮助解决问题，更不管能否上车的态度，完全是敌伪时期的一种官僚主义的恶劣作风，完全不合乎革命职员的工作作风，希望榆次西车站检查改正。
