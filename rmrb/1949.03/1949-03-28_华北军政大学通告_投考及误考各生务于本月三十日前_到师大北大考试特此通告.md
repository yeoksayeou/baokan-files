North China Military and Political University Notice

    Applicants and those who missed the exam must go to Normal University and Peking University for examination before the 30th of this month.

    Our school and the Medical and Accounting Training Class are scheduled to start school in early April. We hope that all students who have not yet entered the school will go to the school (Changxindian Main Campus) before the start of school. In addition, the enrollment offices in Ping (Beijing) have decided to end their work on the 31st of this month and will stop accepting applications on the 29th of this month. We hope that those who wish to apply will do so.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　March 28th, 38th Year of the Republic of China (1949)
