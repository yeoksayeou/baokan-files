The Ping City Representatives Group Presents Flag to Guarding Troops with Grand Ceremony
Respectfully Wishing the Banner of Liberation to be Planted Throughout the Country

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ping City Representatives Group visited and presented flags to the 41st Army and the Garrison Headquarters in the city on the 29th. Workers, students, and businessmen from various factories enthusiastically gathered a large number of comfort items at the Ping City People's Government, along with over a thousand letters of appreciation and two hundred silk banners for the 41st Army and the Garrison Headquarters. A worker from an ordnance factory, Wang Yaqing, wrote to the soldiers: "The banner of liberation is planted in the South, flying everywhere. Although I cannot go with you, I will work hard in the rear, burying myself in making grenades, to better support the front." Students from Tsinghua University wrote: "When the red flag is planted all over China. Goodbye! On the banks of the Huangpu River." Five large trucks flew bright silk banners, with inscriptions such as: "Vanguard of Truth," "Iron Army of the People," "Benevolent and Righteous Army," "Victorious in Every Battle," "Watering Horses in the Yangtze," "Plant the Banner of Mao Zedong Throughout China," and other majestic words. When the trucks passed through streets such as Xisi and Chang'an, they immediately attracted crowds of people. When the delegation entered the garrison of the 41st Army and the Garrison Headquarters, the troops lined up and played military music to welcome them. Comrade Hu Guang, a representative of the Ping City People's Government, read a letter to the soldiers, "We will certainly step up production, study diligently, consolidate the rear to support the front, and conscientiously implement preferential treatment for military personnel, hoping that you will plant the banner of victory in Nanjing, Wuhan, and throughout China." Soldier representatives Shi Yunzao, combat hero from Jinzhou, Chui Li, and others stated: "We will resolutely respond to the hopes of the people of Ping City; we will bring the policies of our Party to all of China and fight for the liberation of the whole country."

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Among the letters to comfort the troops from the students of Tsinghua University, one was written to the cooks. In addition to expressing admiration and respect in the letter, a poem was also presented, saying: The millet rice, is cooked fragrant, eat more, strength is strong, beat the enemy into a panic, who doesn't praise you for doing a great job.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the New Beiping Printing Factory passed a resolution on supporting the army on the 26th at a group meeting, various groups have launched enthusiastic activities. The entire factory resolved to donate half a day's salary on the 27th for military support, to be handled by the Staff and Workers Committee. The following comfort items were donated: one silk banner, inscribed "Success with Every Banner Raised," two dozen pencils, ten catties of Guandong tobacco, thirty-eight notebooks, seventeen letters of appreciation, and five hundred copies of comfort letters printed by all employees, delivered by representatives of the Staff and Workers Committee to the district trade union for forwarding to the Comfort Committee.
