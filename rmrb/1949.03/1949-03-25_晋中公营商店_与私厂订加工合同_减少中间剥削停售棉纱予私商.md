    Jinzhong Publicly Operated Stores
    Sign Processing Contracts with Private Factories
    Reduce Middleman Exploitation by Stopping Sales of Cotton Yarn to Private Merchants
    [Jinzhong Electricity] The Jinzhong District Trade Company recently convened a meeting of managers from its affiliated stores. The meeting reviewed that in the past, when various stores sold yarn on behalf of yarn factories, many stores sold large quantities of cotton yarn to private merchants, causing many cotton weaving factories to suffer from high-interest exploitation by private merchants, resulting in poor quality and high costs of cotton fabrics, making them difficult to sell. As a result, capital turnover was hindered, making it difficult to carry out reproduction, seriously threatening the lives of workers. At the same time, some cotton weaving factories, in pursuit of excessive profits, only sought quantity of products, regardless of quality, which was also one of the reasons for the operational difficulties of the cotton weaving industry. For example, the white cloth produced by private cotton weaving factories in Yuci City had only twelve warp threads and eleven weft threads in every two-fen yarn eye, resulting in extremely poor quality. Based on the above review, the meeting resolved that all general and branch stores will not be allowed to sell cotton yarn to private merchants in the future, but must sell it to direct producers. It was also stipulated that cotton weaving factories must not transfer cotton yarn to others under any pretext in order to profit from it, and those who violate this will have their cotton yarn distribution stopped. In order to encourage the national capitalist economy, the meeting decided that, under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, processing contracts can be signed with private factories, with cotton yarn supplied to private factories at a set price. According to the quality standards of the finished products agreed upon by both parties, the cloth will be purchased at a set price. It is stipulated that for cloth made of 16-count yarn, each bolt should have 2,150 thread ends, and when the width is 36 shi, each shi of density must have 60 warp threads and 50 weft threads to be considered qualified. Basically, weaving foreign cloth is encouraged, but weaving native cloth is not restricted (trade company stores do not purchase native cloth). In addition, in order to implement the spirit of the Jinzhong Administrative Office's production meeting regarding the resolution on producing for famine relief and disaster relief, it was decided to temporarily purchase a batch of foreign cloth with foreign yarn warp and native yarn weft to solve the livelihood difficulties of rural women spinners. Currently, the Tongtai Store of the Yuci Trade Company has conducted precise cost accounting with the local Cotton Weaving Association and has basically reached a preliminary agreement on the processing contract. The principle is: the Tongtai Store uses 35 jin of millet, plus 300 yuan of People's Bank currency, to exchange for one bolt of white cloth made of 16-count yarn from private cotton weaving factories, with the standard being 10 zhang long, 2 chi 6 cun (city measure) wide, and each two-fen yarn eye must have 14 warp threads and 12 weft threads. Other general and branch stores are also conducting trials separately.

　　晋中公营商店
    与私厂订加工合同
    减少中间剥削停售棉纱予私商
    【晋中电】晋中区贸易公司近召集所属各商店经理会议。会中检讨了过去各商店代纱厂售纱时，有不少商店将大批棉纱卖给私商，致使不少棉织工厂遭受私商高利盘剥，形成棉织品质量坏、成本高、不易推销的困难。因而，资金周转不过，难于进行再生产，严重地威胁着工人生活。同时，又由于某些棉织厂为追逐过高利润，只求产品数量多，不顾质量，也是影响棉织业经营困难的原因之一。如榆次市私营绵织工厂所出产之白洋布，每二分的纱眼内仅有经线十二根，纬线十一根，质量极坏。会中根据上述检讨，决议各总、分商店今后一律不准将棉纱卖给私商，要售给直接生产者。并规定各棉织工厂亦不得藉故将棉纱转让他人，以从中渔利，违者停止对其配售。为鼓励国家资本主义经济，会议决定在公私两利的原则下，可与私人工厂订立加工合同，以棉纱作价供给私人工厂，根据双方议定成品质量之标准，按价收购洋布。规定十六支纱的洋布，每匹线头应有二千一百五十根，宽三十六时，每时密度须有经纱六十根，纬纱五十根为合格。基本上鼓励织洋布，但也不限制织土布（贸易公司商店不收购土布）。此外，为贯彻晋中行署生产会议关于生产渡荒与救灾决议的精神，决定暂收购一批经纱洋线纬纱土线之洋布，以解决农村纺妇之生活困难。现榆次贸易公司之同太商店，已与当地棉织公会进行了精密核算成本，基本上订立了加工合同之初步协议。其原则是：同太商店以十六支纱，十八支，外贴制造费与工业利润小米三十五斤及三百元人民钞，来换取私人棉织工厂十六支纱之白洋布一匹，其标准是长十丈，宽二尺六寸（市尺），每二分纱眼须有经纱十四根，纬纱十二根。其他各总、分商店亦在分头试办中。
