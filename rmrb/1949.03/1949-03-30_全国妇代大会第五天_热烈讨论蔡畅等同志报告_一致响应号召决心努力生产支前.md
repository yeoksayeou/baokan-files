    Enthusiastic Discussion of Reports by Comrades Cai Chang and Others
    Unanimous Response to Call to Strive for Production to Support the Front
    [Our Dispatch] On the sixth day of the First National Women's Congress of China (March 29th), the congress discussed the reports of Comrades Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, and Mr. Li Dequan. Nineteen representatives spoke, and the entire day was filled with a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere, with applause and slogans rising one after another. As central speakers for their delegations, Liu Yaxiong of the Northeast delegation focused on the work of urban female workers, Xia Fei of the Central Plains delegation spoke about women's work in the newly liberated areas, Wang Yuecun of the East China delegation reported on the grand scale of women supporting the front in East China, and Lu Zhiliang of the Northwest delegation denounced the crimes of Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in the Northwest to the congress. During the discussion, female workers Liu Guizhen, Zhao Jinzhi, Wang Xiuqin, Wang Fuqing, as well as veteran workers from the Great Revolution era Zhang Jinbao, labor heroes Fang Mingli, Liu Jianrong, Han Xiuzhen, Guo Mengnv, Li Yujin, and anti-enemy struggle heroes Sun Yumin, Liu Yaocheng, and stretcher model Dong Lisheng, all unanimously responded to Comrade Deng Yingchao's call, determined to work harder in production and actively participate in the people's liberation struggle in the future. They also enriched Comrade Deng Yingchao's report from their own personal experiences. Wang Xiuqin, a female worker at the Tianjin Zhonghua Match Factory, said: "Seeing the Communist Party is like seeing the sun, breathing in a breath of fresh air. In the past, I threw matches into the fire, but now I pick up every single one that falls on the ground." Fang Mingli, a production labor hero from Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, where would we get these good days of full granaries and overflowing small bins?" Han Xiuzhen, a female district chief from the East China delegation, explained how she improved her political, economic, and social status by actively participating in production. When Sun Yumin and Liu Yaocheng recounted their heroic deeds, all the representatives present were moved and expressed their respect with applause.
