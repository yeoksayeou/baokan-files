    Polish-Soviet Trade Agreement—The first Polish-Soviet trade agreement, established on August 4, 1947, for a term of one year, stipulated that Poland would exchange cotton textiles, sugar, glass, and non-ferrous metals for cotton, iron, manganese ore, ferroalloys, petroleum, apatite, and chemical products from the Soviet Union. The expanded second Polish-Soviet trade agreement, established on January 26, 1948, for a term of five years (i.e., 1948-1952), stipulated that the Soviet Union would supply Poland not only with the items from the previous agreement but also with automobiles and tractors, etc. Poland would supply the Soviet Union with coal, coking coal, textiles, steel products, sugar, zinc, railroad cars, and cement, etc. At the same time, the Soviet Union and Poland also established an agreement for the Soviet Union to supply Poland with industrial equipment, stipulating that from 1948 to 1956, the Soviet Union would regularly supply Poland with equipment for new large metallurgical factories, power, chemical, and textile industries, as well as equipment for building cities and ports. Such an exchange of goods agreement is entirely beneficial to the economic development of both countries, bringing immense happiness to the people of both nations.
    Decembrists—In early 19th-century Russia, influenced by the French bourgeois revolution, progressive nobles and some progressive military officers formed the revolutionary groups "Southern Society" and "Northern Society," preparing to use military rebellion to oppose Russian feudal autocracy and serfdom. In 1825, Tsar Alexander I of Russia died, and Nicholas I inherited the throne. On the morning of December 14th of the same year, members of the "Northern Society" in the Russian army, using the excuse of refusing to swear allegiance to Nicholas, launched a mutiny. At the time, because the bourgeois leaders dared not use the power of the masses, the mutiny was quickly suppressed. Later, people referred to those who participated in the December 1825 uprising as Decembrists.
