　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Following the murder of Bebelis, Soviet and American labor unions continue to protest, demanding the rescue of other Greek labor activists slated for murder by royalist-fascist elements.

　　The Soviet newspaper "Labor" published on the 3rd a telegram from Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, to Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, stating: The despicable murder of Bebelis, Secretary of the Greek General Confederation of Labor, has aroused deep indignation among the Soviet working people. The new heinous crime committed by the Greek royalist-fascist authorities under the guise of the so-called "suicide" of Bebelis proves that bloody terror is being used everywhere in Greece to deal with democratic leaders. The Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions believes that the World Federation of Trade Unions should once again express its firmest protest against the persecution and assassination of Greek trade union leaders and insist on investigating the circumstances of Bebelis's death. The brutal murderers must be severely punished.

　　At a meeting held in New York, hosted by the American Committee for Aid to Democratic Greece, a resolution was passed on the 1st condemning the terror of Greek fascism, demanding that the United States stop interfering in Greek internal affairs, and protesting against the Athens authorities' "trial" of eleven Greek labor activists. Wallace telegraphed the conference saying, "I stand with you and with Americans in every corner, striving for the early realization of democratic peace in Greece." The "American Trade Union Committee to Stop the Killing of Greek Labor Leaders," recently formed by representatives from the Fur Workers Union, the Maritime Union, the Furniture Workers Union, and others, has begun a five-day, non-stop picket line around the White House from the 2nd to the 6th, demanding the rescue of Greek labor activists facing slaughter by Greek fascists. The committee distributed leaflets stating: "What is happening in Greece could also happen in the United States. The Truman Doctrine rules Greece. Since the Truman Doctrine began, the Greek royalists have passed laws to punish strikers with the death penalty and declared more than a hundred trade unions illegal." According to a report from the Greek news agency, the Athens royalist-fascist authorities are preparing to eliminate large numbers of democratic elements in prisons using the same methods as the murder of Bebelis.

　　对贝贝利加斯被杀害
    苏美人民续提抗议
  　一致坚主严惩残暴的杀人犯
    【新华社陕北六日电】苏联职工会与美国进步团体，继续抗议贝贝利加斯的被害，并要求拯救其他为保皇法西斯分子准备杀害的希腊职工运动者。
    苏联劳动报于三日刊登全苏职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫致世界工联总书记赛扬的电文称：希腊劳工总同盟书记贝贝利加斯之被卑鄙地杀害，已激起苏联劳动人民的深切义愤。希腊保皇法西斯当局在所谓贝贝利加斯“自杀”的斓言掩盖下所造成的新的滔天罪行，证明希腊到处都在以血腥恐怖手段对付民主领袖。全苏职工会中央委员会认为，世界工联应该再度对迫害与暗杀希腊职工会领袖表示最坚决的抗议，并坚主调查贝贝利加斯死难的情况。残暴的杀人犯必须予以严惩。
    在纽约举行的、由美国援助民主希腊委员会主持的会议，于一日通过决议，谴责希腊法西斯的恐怖，要求美国停止干涉希腊内政，并抗议雅典当局“审讯”十一位希腊职工运动者。华莱士致电大会说：“我和你们以及每一个角落的美国人站在一起，争取早日在希腊实现民主的和平”。新近由皮毛工会、海员工会、家具工会等代表组成的“美国职工会制止杀害希腊劳工领袖委员会”，已开始自二日起至六日止在白宫周围进行五昼夜不停的纠察巡逻，要求拯救面临希腊法西斯屠杀的希腊职工运动者。该委员会散发传单称：“希腊发生的事，也可能在美国发生。杜鲁门主义统治着希腊。自从杜鲁门主义开始以后，希腊保皇分子便通过法案对罢工者处以死刑，把一百余个职工会宜布为非法。”按：据希腊通讯社的消息暗示，雅典保皇法西斯当局，正准备以杀害贝贝利加斯的同样手段，大批消灭监狱中的民主分子。
