　　Cultural Activities in the North China People's Liberation Army
    Zhang Jinde
    "An army without culture is a foolish army, and a foolish army cannot defeat Japanese imperialism and build a new China." (Mao Zedong) The North China People's Liberation Army, like its fraternal units in other liberated areas, has always followed this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, using various cultural activities to educate its troops. Some say: The People's Liberation Army is like a university. In fact, it learns more widely and practically than what is learned in school. In their studies, everyone is a student and a teacher at the same time. That is, the mass line of "officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, and soldiers teach soldiers" that the leadership has repeatedly advocated. The leadership uses the wisdom, inventions, and creations of the masses to educate the masses.
    Now, let me introduce some of the most common and effective literary and artistic activities created by the North China People's Liberation Army.
    I. Door-Panel Newspapers
    The door-panel newspaper takes the form of a wall newspaper, but it is not pasted on the wall, but posted on a movable door panel. Like a light cavalry unit, it is very simple and convenient. As soon as the troops arrive at the camp, they erect a door panel in the concentrated area of ​​the unit, and paste the drafts written by everyone on it after the branch or the editor-in-chief has read them and corrected the wrong words and typos, and it is "published." Its editorial department is generally composed with the company branch as the core: the political instructor is the president of the newspaper, in charge of the central content of the newspaper and the overall work; all the soldiers of the company are its correspondents and readers.
    The content and form of the door-panel newspaper are very free. No matter whether it is an event, a question, an opinion, praise or criticism of a comrade, it can be written, written as a clapper talk, poem, three-character classic, Bangzi opera tune, Erhuang tune, Zhui Zi narrative singing, drum story or drawn as a picture. Those who can write will write by themselves, those who can't write will express their meaning and find someone to write for them, and everyone will write together during rest time. One sentence from you, one sentence from me, and a draft is put together. Square paper, triangular paper, and long strips of paper can be used to write drafts. The name of the newspaper can be changed at any time according to the central work of the company and the content of the draft. There are: Determination Newspaper, Hard Training Newspaper, Labor Newspaper, Merit Newspaper, Grenade Throwing Newspaper, Model Newspaper, Marching Newspaper, Combat Newspaper, etc. The location of the door-panel newspaper is also not fixed: when it is time for dinner, the door-panel newspaper is carried to the dining hall, when playing games, it is carried to the playground, when marching, the door panel cannot be used, so the newspaper is scattered and pasted on the backpacks of some comrades, and they read it while walking. When fighting, the door-panel newspaper is carried to the trenches. As long as there is an opportunity, the soldiers gather in front of the door-panel newspaper, and each class competes to read their own newspaper. There is talking and singing, and sometimes there is even a performance. Everyone loves to watch and listen.
    The door-panel newspaper conducts timely and powerful praise and self-criticism to promote work. Comrade Zhang Shenming, the company commander of the 12th company of a certain unit, wrote an article in the door-panel newspaper: "Our company is about to replenish a batch of newly liberated soldiers, everyone come up with ways to help them." Immediately, each squad and individual formulated specific plans to consolidate and help the new soldiers. Zhang Liangchen of the communications squad of a certain battalion was very naughty and nicknamed "Fire Leaper." People in the squad had some opinions about him. Once during a march, others had eight blisters on their feet and did not take the truck, but he was fine and sat in the truck. When camping, Wei Desheng and Lu Yushan jointly drew a cartoon in the door-panel newspaper to criticize him. The picture shows a big truck being pulled by a little rabbit, and a child sitting on the truck exhales and says: "My name is Fire Leaper, I like to sit in the truck." Zhang Liangchen, who never blushed, blushed after seeing this painting. The next day when attacking the ×× station, he automatically delivered letters more than ten times and carried a wounded soldier on his back, correcting his "hanging around and acting weird is popular" mentality.
    II. Gun-Barrel Poems
    Gun-barrel poems are similar to clapper talk, but shorter and more concise, because they represent the determination and will of the soldiers, so they are often pasted on the butts of their guns, the bodies of cannons, and various weapons, hence the name.
    The sentences of the gun-barrel poem are of varying lengths. As long as they appropriately express the soldiers' own thoughts, they can form a poem. For example, pasted on a rifle: "The Type 38 rifle is well wiped, aiming at the enemy cannot run away, hit one when you see one, and seize guns and cannons." Pasted on a machine gun: "The Maxim machine gun is like a dragon, it charges into battle, if you can fight well this time, you will receive great merit at the celebration meeting." Pasted on a small cannon: "My cannon is for the revolution, fighting the enemy, making meritorious deeds." Pasted on a hand grenade: "Hand grenade, twelve taels, throw it out, it explodes loudly, making the enemy lose their lives." On the cook's carrying pole: "Small carrying pole, sharp at both ends, one end oily, one end salty, the food is fragrant and fresh, the soldiers eat their fill and fight happily." Some soldiers also write down their merit-making plans in the form of gun-barrel poems and paste them on their food bags.
    Since its inception, gun-barrel poetry has produced millions of poems. Each unit and each soldier has their own gun-barrel poem; it can be published everywhere and circulated everywhere. It is simple, unadorned, catchy, easy to remember, and full of hatred and contempt for the enemy and a strong will to win.
    III. Soldiers Acting for Soldiers
    "Soldiers Acting for Soldiers" is the theatrical activity of the soldiers. Although there are many theatrical troupes and cultural troupes in the People's Liberation Army that specialize in theatrical work and give巡回 performances to the troops. However, with the victorious development of the Liberation War, the troops expanded, and it was felt that there were too few troupes. Under this circumstance, some troops organized soldiers to self-write, self-perform, and self-watch evening parties. As a result, the performance was very effective. Because real people act out real events, the soldiers find it very familiar and kind. Therefore, the soldiers love to perform and watch. In this way, the "Soldiers Acting for Soldiers" movement of self-writing, self-performing, and self-watching has been widely developed in the troops.
    The writing and directing of "Soldiers Acting for Soldiers" mostly adopts the method of collective discussion. After everyone discusses and determines to perform and write about a certain event, the actors try their best to find the persons involved; the lines are written by the actors themselves. Then, everyone answers each other one sentence at a time, and it becomes a play. Sometimes there is no writing process at all. They start rehearsing from the beginning. After multiple rehearsals, it is finalized, and then the lines are recorded, and it becomes a script.
    The selection of materials for "Soldiers Acting for Soldiers" initially only generally praised models and educated the backward. Later, they consciously combined it with the central work of each period in the company—such as training, marching, and fighting—and selected typical deeds to write and perform, which played a great role in the education of the troops. For example: The Second Company of a certain unit performed "Tian Jiachen's Meritorious Service in Throwing Grenades" in training. After watching it, soldier Shi Zhuzi of the Seventh Squad went outside the village to throw grenades whenever he had time. He said: "I must surpass Tian Jiachen, and I must become a character in the play like Tian Jiachen!" During the grievance campaign, a certain unit compiled a play about the history and exemplary deeds of Luo Kunhua, a great hero of their company, who suffered in the landlord's family since he was a child, was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army and forced to be a soldier, and then joined our army after liberation and bravely killed the enemy and made great achievements. Many viewers cried. And they said in unison: "This is stronger than attending class. We can understand what class is!" Liberated soldiers Guo Yongde and others cried the most. They said: "Blood feuds can only be avenged in the People's Liberation Army. We will not go home until we capture Chiang Kai-shek." Therefore, a wave of learning from Luo Kunhua was set off. Luo Kunhua was praised, and he worked even harder himself.
    IV. Battlefield Leaflets
    When the People's Liberation Army was besieging large cities, a large number of troops were in the monotonous trenches for a long time, and they especially needed cultural entertainment. The door-panel newspaper can be carried to the trenches, but it has a big disadvantage, that is, it looks too crowded and is not suitable for the requirements of dispersed concealment. Therefore, many small-scale cultural and entertainment activities have been developed among the soldiers, among which clapper talk is the most popular. They express all their life, study, and combat experiences in this form. At this time, the leadership consciously organized and absorbed the soldiers' creations, printed them on small pieces of paper, and then distributed them to the soldiers, and they became "battlefield leaflets."
    "Battlefield leaflets" are actually scattered door-panel newspapers. The difference is that they are printed, and the form is more neat and beautiful, so the soldiers like them even more. Especially those leaflets about how to deal with the enemy's new weapons, which can really come in handy when the time comes, and almost every soldier can memorize them. For example: During the Jinzhong Campaign, Li Hongyin, a new soldier of a certain unit, was hit by the enemy's white phosphorus bomb during the charge. He rolled several times, and there was still a little bit that had not been extinguished, so he hurriedly took off his clothes and threw them away, and as a result, he was not injured. After the battle, as soon as he came back, he said: "The method mentioned in the leaflet is really effective. I was hit by a white phosphorus bomb and did it according to the method in the leaflet, and I was not injured at all."
    The characteristic of "battlefield leaflets" is that they more closely cooperate with the development of the battle and conduct political mobilization and military technical education in a timely manner. Various leaflets appeared in a timely manner according to the needs of the military situation.
    In summary, all the above-mentioned cultural activities of the troops have a common feature, that is, they serve the soldiers, and they are written, read, recited, and sung by soldiers "from the masses, to the masses." The form is short, concise, simple, unadorned, and diverse, and is loved by the soldiers. In particular, it is full of political content and closely combined with every movement of the troops, such as training, grievance, marching, fighting, making meritorious deeds, and setting an example, which has actively played a role in promoting them. This has solved two basic problems in the literary and artistic work of our troops for our literary and artistic workers. First, the direction of development of the literary and artistic work of the troops; second, how literary and artistic work serves politics.

　　华北人民解放军中的文化活动
    张晋德
    “没有文化的军队，是愚蠢的军队，而愚蠢的军队是不能够战胜日本帝国主义和建设新中国的。”（毛泽东）华北人民解放军和其他解放区的兄弟部队一样，从来就遵循着毛泽东同志的这一指示，以各种各样的文化活动来教育自己的部队。有人说：解放军就象一所大学校。其实它比在学校里所学到的知识更广泛，更实际。他们在学习中，人人是学生，同时也是先生。也就是领导上一再倡导的“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的群众路线。领导上就这样运用群众的智慧、发明和创造，来教育群众。
    现在介绍一下华北人民解放军创造的最普遍而最有效的几种文艺活动。
    一、门板报
    门板报采取墙报形式，不过它不贴在墙壁上，而是张贴在活动的门板上。它象轻骑部队一样，非常简单、方便。部队一到宿营地，就在本单位集中的场所，竖起一块门板来，把大家写的稿子，经过支部或编辑主任看过，修改一下错字和别字，贴在上面，就“出版了”。它的编辑部，一般都以连队支部为核心组成：政治指导员是报社社长，掌握报纸中心内容和全盘工作；全连队的战士，都是它的通讯员和读者。
    门板报的内容和形式都很自由，不管是一件事、一个问题、一个意见、对一个同志的表扬和批评，都可以写，写成快板、诗、三字经、梆子腔、二簧调、坠子、鼓书或画成画都可以。会写的就自己写，不会写的说出自己的意思找人代笔，大家在休息时间合伙写，你一句，我一句就凑成了一篇稿子。用四方纸，三角纸，长条纸都能写稿。报的名子可以根据连里的中心工作和稿子的内容随时变换，有：决心报、苦练报、劳动报、立功报、投弹报、模范报、行军报、战斗报等等。门板报放的位置也不固定：开饭时就把门板报抬到饭厅里，游戏时就抬到操场上，行军时不能用门板，就把报分散贴在一些同志的背包上，边走边看，作战时就把门板报抬到战壕里，只要一有机会，战士们就都聚集在门板报的前面，各班争先读自己的报。有说有唱，有时还带表演。大家都爱看爱听。
    门板报及时和有力地进行表扬与自我批评，用以推动工作。某部十二连连长张申明同志在门板报上写了一篇“我连马上要补充一批新解放战士，大家都来想办法帮助他们。”随即各班及个人就订出巩固和帮助新战士的具体计划。某营通讯班张良臣，很调皮，外号叫“火里蹦子”，班里人都对他有些意见。有一次行军，别人脚上打了八个泡不坐车，他好好的就坐在车上了。宿营时，魏得胜和卢玉山两人合伙画了一张漫画在门板报上批评他，画的是一辆大车，让一个小兔子拉着，车上坐着个小孩，嘴里吐出一口气说：“我叫火里蹦子，我好坐车。”从来不红脸的张良臣，看到这张画以后脸红了。第二天打××车站时，他自动送信十几次，还背下伤员一名，改正了他那“吊儿郎当怪吃香”的思想。
    二、枪杆诗
    枪杆诗类似快板，不过比快板短小、精干，因为它代表着战士们的决心和意志，所以常把它贴在自己的枪托上、炮身上和各种武器上，故而得名。
    枪杆诗的字句长短不定，只要恰当的说出了战士自己的心意，便可构成一篇。如贴在步枪上的：“三八枪，擦得好，瞄准敌人跑不了，看见一个打一个，又缴枪来又缴炮。”贴在机枪上的：“马克辛机枪如条龙，打起仗来它冲锋，这次再能打得好，庆功会上立大功。”贴在小炮上的：“我的炮，为革命，打敌人，立功勋。”贴在手榴弹上的：“手榴弹，十二两，投出去，炸得响，管叫敌人把命丧。”炊事员扁担上的：“小扁担，两头尖，一头油，一头盐，菜饭做的香又鲜，战士吃饱打的欢。”有些战士把自己的立功计划也用枪杆诗的形式写下来，贴在自己的饭包上。
    枪杆诗自产生以来，已经出现了千百万篇，每个部队，每个战士，都有自己的枪杆诗；到处都可以出版，到处都在流传。它，简单、朴素、顺口、容易记，充满了对敌人的仇恨，蔑视，和坚强的胜利意志。
    三、兵演兵
    “兵演兵”，这是战士们的戏剧活动。解放军里虽然有不少的剧团、文工团，专门从事戏剧工作，给部队巡回公演。但是随着解放战争的胜利发展，部队扩大了，便感到剧团太少。在此情况下，有的部队便组织战士们自编、自演、自看的晚会。结果，演出的效果很好。因为真人演真事，战士们看起来是非常熟习而亲切的。所以战士们都爱演，也都爱看。这样一来，自编、自演、自看的“兵演兵”运动，便在部队里普遍的开展起来。
    “兵演兵”的编演，多采取集体讨论的方法。大家商量确定要演编某一件事以后，演员尽量找当事人；台词由演员自己负责编。于是，大家在一起你一言我一语的对答起来，就成了戏。有时根本没有编写过程，一开始就排演，经过多次排演，定型了，再把台词记录下来，就成了剧本。
    “兵演兵”的选材，开始只是一般的表扬模范，教育落后。以后便有意识的结合着连里每个时期的中心工作——如练兵、行军、打仗等，找出典型的事迹编演出来，对部队的教育，起了很大的作用。比如：某部二连在练兵中演出了“田介臣投弹立功”，七班战士石柱子看后，每天有空就到村外投弹。他说：“我一定要超过田介臣，我也要象田介臣一样成为演剧中的人物！”某部在诉苦运动中，有一个连把他连里的大功臣罗坤华自小在地主家受苦，被蒋军抓去当兵，解放参加我军后，英勇杀敌立大功的历史及其模范事迹编剧演出，许多观众都哭了。并且异口同声的说：“这比上课还强，咱可闹清什么叫阶级了！”解放战士郭永德等，哭得最厉害，他们说：“血海深仇，只有在解放军里才能报，捉不住蒋介石誓不回家。”因此掀起学习罗坤华的热潮，罗坤华受到表扬，自己也更努力了。
    四、战场传单
    解放军在对大城市实行围困的时候，大批的部队便长时日的处在生活单调的战壕里，他们特别需要文化娱乐。门板报可以抬到战壕里，但是有一个大缺点，就是看起来太拥挤，不适于分散隐蔽的要求。于是在战士中就发展了许多小型的文化娱乐活动，其中以快板最流行，他们把一切的生活、学习和战斗经验都用这种形式表达出来。这时，领导上便有意识的组织和吸收战士们的创作，分别印在小纸片上，再散发到战士群里，就成了“战场传单”。
    “战场传单”其实就是分散开来的门板报，不同的是经过印刷，形式更加整齐好看，战士们也就更加喜欢它。特别是那些关于对付敌人新式武器的办法的传单，到时候真能顶用，差不多每个战士都能背下来。比如：晋中战役中，某部新战士李红银在冲锋时中了敌人的黄磷弹，他就连打了几个滚，还有一点没有熄，又急忙把衣服脱下扔了，结果没有受伤。战斗结束后，他一回来就说：“传单上说的办法就是灵验，我中了黄磷弹，照着传单上的办法做了，一点也没受伤”。
    “战场传单”的特点是更紧密的配合着战役的发展，及时进行着政治动员和军事技术的教育。跟着军事情况的需要，及时出现了各种传单。
    综合以上各种部队文化活动，都具备着一个共同的特点，这就是为兵服务，而又是“从群众中来，到群众中去”的士兵编写、士兵阅读、传诵、歌唱的。其形式是短小精悍，简单朴素，多种多样，为战士所喜闻乐见。尤其是充满政治内容，并紧密的结合部队的练兵、诉苦、行军、打仗、立功、表模等每一个运动，积极的起了推动作用。这便给我们部队文艺工作者解决了部队文艺工作上的两个基本问题。一、是部队文艺工作发展的方向问题；二、是文艺工作如何服务于政治的问题。
