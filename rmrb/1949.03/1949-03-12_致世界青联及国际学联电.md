　　Telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students
    【Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th】 The Fourteenth National Congress of Students of China sent telegrams on the 5th to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the youths of all countries, and the President of the International Union of Students, Mr. Grohman, and all members. The telegrams stated:
    The Fourteenth National Congress of Students of China was held from March 1st to 6th in Peiping, the renowned center of the newly liberated student movement. This is an unprecedented gathering of Chinese students. The approximately 200 delegates attending the congress, representing over a million university and middle school students, came from all regions of China, including all ethnic groups of China. The congress has more complete representation than any previous meeting because the Chinese People's Liberation War has already achieved a decisive victory throughout the country.
    At the meeting, we summarized the experience of the Chinese student movement over the past thirty years and believe that the path of the Chinese student movement, which has actively participated in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle from the beginning, is correct and successful. This principle will continue to be successful in the future.
    Please convey our aspirations and convictions to the youth and students of the world, which is that the youth and students of all countries fighting for democracy, peace, and progress, together with the people everywhere, can achieve their goals. We hope that the youth and students of all countries will cooperate closely in their common struggle.

　　致世界青联及国际学联电
    【新华社北平十日电】中华全国学生第十四届代表大会五日分别致电世界民主青年联盟、各国青年及国际学生联合会主席格罗曼、全体会员，电文称：
    中华全国学生第十四届代表大会，已于三月一日至六日在新解放的学生运动的著名中心——北平举行。这是中国学生空前的大汇合。出席这次大会的约二百余名代表，代表着百万以上的大学生和中学生，来自中国各个地区，包括中国的各个民族。大会具有比过去任何一次会议更完满的代表性，是由于中国人民解放战争已经在全国获得了有决定性的胜利。
    我们在会议上总结了三十年来中国学生运动的经验，认为中国学生运动自始就积极参加中国人民的革命斗争的道路，是正确的和成功。这个道理今后将继续得到成功。
    请把我们的热望和确信告诉世界的青年和学生，这就是全世界各国为民主、和平和进步而奋斗的青年和学生和各地人民在一起，都能达到他们的目的。希望各国青年和学生在共同的奋斗中亲切合作。
