The thirty militiamen of Garden Village in the Sixth District of Bo'ai County spent last year fighting guerrillas in the mountains. After returning home in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, their families complained that they had been neglecting production and didn't want them to be militiamen anymore. The militiamen themselves felt that they were constantly preparing for war and couldn't spare any time to earn money for basic necessities like salt and vinegar, so their morale was low.

When families were complaining and the militiamen's morale was low, the militia captain proposed organizing production during lulls in the fighting. After everyone discussed it, they took advantage of their time in the mountains fighting guerrillas to cut thorns and sell them for 40,000 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency, same below). They also spared time to collectively do odd jobs for the masses, earning 110,000 yuan in silver dollars, and received a public loan of 140,000 yuan, gathering a total of 290,000 yuan to start production.

At the beginning of production, they bought some bamboo poles, and everyone worked together. Some carved chopsticks, some wove baskets, doing whatever they were good at, like one big family. After a period of time, a problem arose: the craftsmen felt that they were losing out by distributing profits equally. After discovering this problem, everyone democratically discussed and stipulated that work points would be assigned based on skill level and speed of work, and profits would be distributed according to the points. This way, no one lost out, and everyone's enthusiasm for production immediately increased.

Their production is very flexible. Without hindering the execution of tasks, they do whatever is suitable. The above sold bamboo products and bought sheep, earning over 1 million silver dollars in two trips. After the capital expanded, they also extracted two people to run an oil mill (eating their own 30% profit and giving 70% to the collective). They also extracted three people to specialize in running errands (eating 20% of the collective and giving 80% to the collective).

Last year, when planting autumn crops, most of the militiamen's families were in difficulty. After everyone discussed it, it was decided to calculate the accounts monthly, and those who wanted to withdraw money could do so, while those who didn't want to could convert it into capital. This solved everyone's difficulties in buying fertilizer and seeds. When winter arrived, everyone made a cotton-padded coat from their share of the production dividends, solving the difficulties of the militiamen. After that the families were all happy. Later, after twelve people were decided to participate in the militia expeditionary company, everyone had no objections, and it was stipulated that for the family members of the militiamen in the expeditionary company, each militiaman at home would be responsible for taking care of one family.

Because their production is good, it has played a great role in consolidating the militia, and the families no longer say they don't want them to be militiamen.

　　花园村组织民兵生产
    博爱六区花园村三十个民兵，去年在山上打游击，阴历七月下山后，家里人都瞒怨耽误了生产，不让再当民兵，民兵也觉得天天备战，腾不出身子，连个买盐打醋钱也没有，情绪不高。
    家庭瞒怨，民兵情绪不高的时候，民兵队长提出在战争空隙中组织起来搞生产。经大家讨论后，便在山上打游击时，顺便割荆棘卖了四万元（冀钞，下同），又抽空集体给群众打短工赚洋十一万，公家贷款十四万元，共集合了二十九万元搞起生产。
    生产开始先买了些竹杆，大家一齐动手，有的刻筷，有的编篮编筐子，会干啥就干啥，活象一个大家庭。过了一个时期，出问题了，手艺人的觉得按人分红自己吃亏。发现这个问题后，大家便民主讨论、规定了按技术好坏和做活快慢评工记分，按分分红。这样都不吃亏了，大家的生产劲头马上又高起来。
    他们生产很灵活，在不妨害执行任务的情况下：啥合适就干啥。上由卖了竹货买回羊来，两趟就赚洋一百余万元。本钱扩大后，又抽出两人搞了个油房（吃自己三七分红）。又抽出三人抽空专门跑外（吃大伙二八分红。）
    去年种秋时，大部民兵家庭困难，经大家讨论，决定一月一算帐，愿抽的抽，不愿抽的可转成本钱，这样解决了大家买肥料和种籽的困难。冬天到了，每人又从该分的生产红利中做了一身棉衣；解决了民兵的困难后，家人都喜欢了。后来决定了十二个人参加民兵远征连以后，大家也都无意见，并规定对远征连民兵的家属，在家民兵每人负责照顾一家。
    因为他们生产的好，对民兵巩固起了很大作用，家人再也不说不让干民兵了。
