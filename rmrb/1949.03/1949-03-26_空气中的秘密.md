　　Secrets in the Air
    Editor: I encountered a question in my textbook: What are the components of air? What is its relationship with humans? Please answer.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Pingdingshan Third High School Hao Yunchuan

    Comrade Hao Yunchuan:
    Within sixty kilometers of the earth, there is a layer of constantly flowing, odorless, tasteless, and colorless transparent gas—air. According to tests by Norwegian scientist Poole, there is still thin air at altitudes above four hundred kilometers.
    People used to think that air was an element. It was not until the eighteenth century, after research by chemists such as Scheele, Cavendish, Priestley, and Lavoisier, that it was known that air was not a single element but a mixture of several gases. In the air, oxygen accounts for 21 percent, nitrogen accounts for 78 percent, argon accounts for 0.94 percent, carbon dioxide accounts for 0.03 to 0.04 percent, the rest being water vapor, trace amounts of hydrogen, and several rare elements such as helium, neon, krypton, xenon, etc. In addition, dust and microorganisms also float around in it. As for the air in large cities or industrial areas, it often contains hydrogen sulfide and sulfur oxide.
    Although there are many elements in the air, only oxygen is involved in the chemical reactions within our bodies. Oxygen is essential for maintaining human life. It is inhaled into the lungs, then sent into the blood by capillaries, where it oxidizes with nutrients in the blood, turning into carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled.
    Although air cannot be seen or touched, it has weight. One cubic meter of air weighs one kilogram and three grams.
    According to MacPherson, of the 21 percent oxygen in the air we inhale, 16 percent remains in the air we exhale. Thus, only 5 percent is involved in chemical reactions in the lungs. The chemical reaction of oxygen in the lungs is also called combustion, which constantly generates heat to maintain our normal body temperature between 36.5 and 37 degrees Celsius.
    Air is the primary condition for maintaining our lives. Other animals and plants also need it in the same way. Even fish and other aquatic animals and plants living in water can only live because of the air that permeates and mixes in the water.

### 空气中的秘密

　　空气中的秘密
    编者同志：我在课本中遇到一个问题：空气有哪些成份？其与人类的关系如何？请解答。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　平定三高郝云川郝云川同志：
    在离地球六十公里以内，包围着一层流动不停、无臭无味无色透明的气体——空气。据挪威科学家普尔升的测验，在四百公里以上的高空中也还有稀薄空气的存在。
    从前的人以为空气是一种元素，直至十八世纪，经社勒、卡汾狄斯、普利士德利及拉瓦西等化学家的研究，才知道空气并非一种元素，而是几种气体的混合物。在空气中，氧占百分之二十一、氮占百分之七十八、氩占百分之○·九四、二氧化碳占百分之○·○三至○·○四，其余为水蒸气，极微量的氢及几种稀有的元素如氦、氖、氪、氙等，此外还有尘埃和微生物也杂游在中间。至于大都市或工厂区的空气中，并常有硫化氢和氧化硫等。
    虽然空气中有着很多的元素，但吸入我们体内起化学作用的只有氧。氧是维持人类生命的东西，吸入肺中，便由微血管送入血液中，与血液中的营养物质氧化，变成二氧化碳，再呼出体外。
    空气虽不能看到或摸触，然而它是有重量的，一立方公尺的空气重一公分三公厘。
    我们吸入的空气中的百分之二十一的氧，据麦费荪的说法，呼出的空气中还有氧百分之十六；这样，在肺中起化学作用的只有百分之五。氧在肺中起的化学作用，也叫做燃烧作用，不绝的发生热量，以维持我们摄氏三十六度半到三十七度之间的正常的体温。
    空气是维持我们生命的第一个条件，其他的动物和植物也都同样地需要着它，甚至连住在水中的鱼及其他动植物，也因为水中有渗透和混和着的空气才能生活。
