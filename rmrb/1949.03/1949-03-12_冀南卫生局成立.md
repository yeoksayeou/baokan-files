　　Jinan Health Bureau Established
    [Jinan Dispatch] In order to promote mass health movements, the Jinan District established a Health Bureau on the first of this month. Hao Baokang, Huang Yueting, and Liu Shide were appointed as Director and Deputy Directors, respectively. The bureau has two departments: Health Administration and Epidemic Prevention, with an attached Epidemic Prevention Brigade. Currently, to prevent the spread of smallpox, the bureau has begun organizing Chinese and Western doctors throughout the district to provide free vaccination with cowpox. A specific plan has been formulated: for children under the age of thirteen, vaccination rates should reach 50% in sparsely populated areas and 70% to 80% in densely populated areas. Fresh vaccine has been distributed to each special district, and preparations are underway to organize and provide short-term training for Chinese and Western doctors and primary school teachers in the townships to carry out this work. To address their living difficulties, the government will issue each person three catties of food coupons per day as a subsidy. It has also been decided that all the above preparations will be completed before the 15th, and vaccinations will begin in the townships immediately, to be completed by April 5th.
