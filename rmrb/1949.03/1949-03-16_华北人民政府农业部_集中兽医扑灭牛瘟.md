    [This Dispatch] Rinderpest is still rampant in various regions of North China, spreading over a distance of more than a thousand *li*.

This request was approved, and Director Chen Lingfeng and Deputy Director Lin Shan led an epidemic prevention team of thirty-five people, arriving in Beiping on the 7th of this month. On the 9th, they set off for Chahar for prevention and treatment, and to manufacture serum during the prevention and treatment process, to supply the needs. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture of the North China People's Government has also registered more than 50 veterinarians in the city. A portion of them have already gathered at the Cotton Production Improvement Office to discuss their experiences, and they will also depart within a few days, heading to Taihang, Jinzhong, Taiyue, Jinnan, Jizhong and other places to eradicate rinderpest.
