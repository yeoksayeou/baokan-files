How Songfan Village Rectified the Militia Organization During the Land Reform Party Rectification?

Songfan Village is an experimental village for land reform in the seventh district of Xiangyuan. The village militia grew and strengthened during the War of Resistance Against Japan through mass movements and struggles against the enemy. The village has a total of forty-four militiamen (twenty-four new middle peasants and twenty middle peasants), of whom nine had poor work styles, five over-estimated fruit yields, and twelve were hooligans and corrupt. During the "Three Checks" in 1947 (checking ideology, work style, and class), the militia became pessimistic and disorganized because they were simply punished without ideological education, thinking "being a militiaman has no good end." After the land reform, the militia shifted from pessimism and inaction to active work. What accounts for this change? The main reason is that the militia was rectified during the democratic party rectification at the end of the land reform. Throughout the movement, the militia received systematic ideological education in a step-by-step and planned manner. The methods were:

(1) Rectifying the peasant association in conjunction with rectifying the militia. First, mobilize party members in the branch to recognize that the militia is a mass armed force led by the Party. To improve the militia work, the branch must strengthen its leadership over the militia, overcoming the past view that the branch did not attach importance to the militia. Then, study the methods of rectifying the militia in the process of rectifying the peasant association.

Convene a forum of cadres above the level of militia squad leader and peasant association and women's association group leader to affirm the achievements of past movements. Then, make everyone realize that the quality of organizational rectification is the key to determining future work. Rely on cadres above the level of militia squad leader and absorb good peasant association members to participate in the rectification of the militia during the rectification of the peasant association. Start by solving ideological problems, letting the militia talk about their past contributions. In the process of everyone recalling the glorious struggles of history, they realize that they play a backbone role in the village. Militiaman Wang Gengnian said: "Everyone knows our achievements. We have relaxed our efforts in the past six months, and landlords and special agents have taken the opportunity to be active, causing us to suffer a lot. If we don't work hard in the future, it won't work. To do it well, we must rectify ourselves internally." After initially solving ideological problems, proceed to solve specific problems, restoring the membership of wrongly criticized militiamen. Members of the peasant association said: "We didn't clearly identify classes in the past, and people in the same family didn't recognize each other. Now that we have clarified the situation, we must restore their membership." Militiaman Wang Niansuo (wrongly criticized household) said: "We can't just blame everyone for the wrong criticism at that time; my family also had some shortcomings." At the same time, the village cadres also checked the guns of the middle-peasant militiamen who had been disarmed. After mutual self-criticism, the militiamen (wrongly criticized households) who had been squeezed out in the past were restored to their militia membership. It was decided to expel militiaman ×××, who had a very bad work style and refused to change. One activist in the movement joined the militia. After the rectification, the first and fifteenth of each month were designated as Militia Days (for life review meetings and cleaning weapons), and a leave system was established. (2) Promoting Militia Self-Criticism during Party Rectification: Widely publicize the Party rectification policy within and outside the Party, so that Party members and the masses understand that the Party rectification is to improve the Party and provide better services to the masses. It is not about kicking people when they are down, but about treating illnesses and saving people, and right and wrong must be distinguished.

After everyone understood the Party rectification policy, Party member militiamen automatically conducted self-criticism, which promoted the self-criticism of the entire militia. Militiaman Guo Dan was a retired soldier who didn't perform duties, didn't contribute labor rice, didn't attend night school, and only acted like a hooligan. He would glare when he spoke. In his self-criticism, he said: "This kind of behavior completely forgets the glorious tradition of the Eighth Route Army. I am determined to correct it in the future and will never be glib or lazy." The masses criticized Li Heidan for pretending to be sick and not participating in the war. After self-criticism, he admitted his mistake. After mass self-criticism, the cadre militiamen and the masses became more united, and the militiamen all established the progressive idea of "washing their faces every day and improving themselves."

(3) Combining Summary Education with Militia Future Education and Task Education.

After the militia was rectified, their ideology and work style were improved, but they did not fully understand the future of the people's armed forces. First, by publicizing the news of our army's victory, we explained the various bases for fundamentally defeating Chiang Kai-shek in about a year, which increased confidence in victory. Militiaman Shi Qixian said: "Seeing that Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished, it is not enough to sit and wait for victory. We should seize the opportunity and add fuel to the fire to quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek." Li Guanfa added: "We cannot relax maintaining local law and order while embarking on a distant campaign to fight Chiang Kai-shek. We have suffered a great loss in the first half of the year due to relaxing our activities. We must strengthen our armed work in the future." After discussion, everyone recognized the importance of armed work, which cannot be relaxed for a moment, and thus became more motivated.

　　送返村是怎样在土改整党中
  　整顿民兵组织的？
    送返是襄垣七区土地改革的实验村，这村民兵是在抗日战争中经过群众运动与对敌斗争中生长壮大起来的，全村共有四十四个民兵（廿四个新中农，二十个中农），其中作风不好的九人，多估果实的五人，流氓腐化的十二人。一九四七年在“三查”时，查思想查作风查阶级，因未注意到从思想上进行教育，只单纯的处罚，因而民兵因为“当民兵没有好下场”，悲观情绪逐渐高涨：不做工作，组织涣散。结束土地改革后，民兵由悲观不干转到积极工作了。为啥会有这样的收获呢？主要是在结束土地改革民主整党中进行了整顿民兵，在整个运动中对民兵有步骤有计划的进行了系统的思想教育，其办法是：
    （一）整顿农会结合整顿民兵。首先在支部中动员党员，使大家认识民兵是党领导的群众武装，要想搞好民兵工作，支部必须加强对民兵的领导，克服了过去支部对民兵不重视的看法，然后研究在整顿农会中整顿民兵的办法。
    在党外召开民兵班长、农会、妇会小组长以上干部的座谈会，肯定过去运动的成绩，然后使大家认清组织整顿的好坏是决定今后工作的关键。在整顿农会中依靠民兵班长以上干部并吸收好的农会会员参加整顿民兵。开始先解决思想问题，让民兵说过去的功劳，在大家回忆历史的光荣斗争中，认识到自己在村中起着骨干作用，民兵王根年说：“咱们的成绩大家都知道，半年来咱们松了劲，地主特务趁机活动，使咱们吃了不少亏，如果以后不好好干可不行；要想弄好，咱们内部必须整顿一番。”初步解决思想后，接着解决具体问题，恢复错斗民兵的队籍，农会会员说：“咱们过去划阶级不明确，一家人认不得一家人，现在澄了底，一定要划回来。”民兵王碾锁（错斗户）说：“当时划错斗争不能光怨大家，俺家也有不对的地方。”同时村干部对下了中农民兵的枪也做了检查。经互相检讨后，过去被挤出的民兵（错斗户）都恢复了民兵队籍。对作风很坏不转变的民兵×××大家决议把他开除了，运动中的积极分子有一人参加了民兵。经过整顿后，规定了初一、十五为民兵日（生活检讨会、擦晒武器）并建立了请假制度。　（二）整党中推动民兵检讨：在党内党外广泛宣传整党政策，使党员群众都认识整党是为了把党整好，给群众更好的办事，不是落井下石，而是治病救人，是非一定要分清。
    大家了解了整党政策后，党员民兵自动的自我检查，推动了整个民兵的自我检查，民兵郭旦是个荣退军人，不支差、不出勤工米、不上夜校光流氓气，一说话三瞪眼，他在检讨时说：“我这种做法完全忘记了八路军的光荣传统，今后坚决要改正，绝不俏皮倒蛋。”群众对栗黑蛋装病不去参战提出批评，经自我检查，承认自己的不对。经群众性的自我检查后，使干部民兵和群众更加团结了，民兵都树立了“天天洗脸，改进自己”的前进思想。
    （三）总结教育中结合进行民兵前途教育与任务教育。
    民兵经过整顿后，思想作风有了改进，但对人民武装的前途不蹬底，首先从宣传我军胜利消息中说明一年左右根本上打垮蒋介石的各种根据，提高了胜利信心。民兵史启贤说：“眼看蒋介石快要完蛋，坐着等胜利可不行，咱们应乘热和泥，火上加油，很快的打垮蒋介石。”李官法接着说：“远征参战打老蒋，维持地方治安可不能放松，前半年咱们放松活动，吃了多大亏，今后要加强武装工作才行。”经过讨论，大家就如画龙点睛，认清了武装工作一时一刻也不能放松，于是干的劲头愈大了。
