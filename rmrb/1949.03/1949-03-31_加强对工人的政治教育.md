Strengthen Political Education for Workers

Under the current new situation, the Party's center of gravity has shifted from the countryside to the cities. The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party has issued a resounding call for us to make great efforts to learn how to lead the urban people in their victorious struggle and to learn how to manage and build cities. To this end, we must resolutely rely on the proletariat, unite with other working masses, intellectuals, and all democrats to work together for the restoration and development of production and the construction of people's cities.

Why rely on the proletariat? The reason is very clear: the Chinese proletariat is the leading class of the Chinese revolution. From the very beginning of its entry onto the revolutionary stage, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has waged particularly resolute and thorough struggles against imperialism, feudal forces, and later, bureaucratic capital, becoming the most conscious and organized class in Chinese society. Only by relying on the proletariat can we lead all the people to victory.

To correctly rely on the proletariat, we must patiently carry out educational and organizational work. The Chinese proletariat is most rich in revolutionary fighting spirit, but on the other hand, it must also be admitted that the Chinese proletariat has its inevitable weaknesses. For example, its numbers are relatively small, its age is relatively young, and its cultural level is relatively low. For a long time, under the oppression and rule of imperialism, feudalism, and the comprador class, it has been separated from the vanguard of its own class—the Chinese Communist Party—for a relatively long period. Some of them unconsciously accepted some of the anesthesia and poisoning of the old society. Now that national victory is imminent, in all liberated cities, the Chinese Communist Party and the proletariat are further united. The Party must unite the entire working class to overcome its own weaknesses, organize them, educate them, and make them a true leading class of society.

In this way, we have much work to do. For example, we must correctly implement labor policies, care for workers' lives and welfare, organize the entire working class, strengthen trade unions, and, most urgently at present, enhance workers' awareness and strengthen political education for the proletariat. We must conduct systematic education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for workers, adopt various learning methods, such as opening short-term training classes, workers' night schools, and discussion groups, and use newspapers, radio stations, theatrical troupes, etc., to guide workers in establishing a correct outlook on life, understanding the basic issues of the Chinese revolution and the Party's current policies, so that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are combined with the workers' movement. Only in this way can we greatly develop initiative and creativity on the basis of the awakening of the working class. This is the basic guarantee for restoring and developing production, building cities, and realizing the leadership of cities over the countryside.

The experience of the workers' movement in cities such as Shijiazhuang and Jiaozuo proves that workers in various places have extremely high enthusiasm for learning. They demand to learn politics, culture, and technology. Party committees, trade unions, and factory administrative departments in various places must earnestly conduct educational work for workers, and first of all, do a good job in political education. This is an extremely important task.

　　加强对工人的政治教育
    在目前新的形势下，党的工作重心已由乡村移到城市，党的二中全会响亮号召我们用极大的努力去学会领导城市人民进行胜利的斗争，学会管理城市与建设城市。为此，就必须坚决依靠无产阶级，团结其他劳动群众，知识分子及一切民主人士共同为恢复与发展生产，建设人民的城市而努力。
    为什么要依靠无产阶级？道理是很明白的，中国无产阶级是中国革命的领导阶级，他一开始走上革命的舞台便在中国共产党领导之下同帝国主义，封建势力及后来的官僚资本进行了特别坚决的和特别彻底的斗争，成为中国社会里最觉悟和最有组织性的阶级，只有依靠无产阶级，才能领导全体人民走向胜利。
    正确依靠无产阶级必须耐心地进行教育工作和组织工作，中国无产阶级最富于革命斗争性，但另一方面，也必须承认中国无产阶级是有其不可避免的弱点。例如人数较少，年龄较轻，文化水准较低，他们长期的在帝国主义封建买办阶级压迫统治之下同本阶级的先锋队——中国共产党有着较长时期的隔离，其中有些人不自觉地接受了一些旧社会的麻醉和毒害。现在全国即将胜利，在一切解放了的城市里，中国共产党同无产阶级是进一步的结合了，党必须团结全体工人阶级克服自身的弱点，组织他们，教育他们，使之成为真正的社会领导阶级。
    这样，我们便有许多工作要做，譬如必须正确执行劳动政策，关心工人生活和福利，必须组织全体工人阶级，壮大职工会，而在目前最为迫切的则是提高工人觉悟，加强对无产阶级的政治教育，对工人进行系统的马列主义、毛泽东思想的教育，采取各式各样的学习方法，如开短期训练班，工人夜校，座谈会以及通过报纸，广播电台，剧团等来引导工人建立正确的人生观，懂得中国革命基本问题及党的当前政策，使马列主义毛泽东思想与工人运动相结合。也只有如此，才能在工人阶级觉悟的基础上大大发挥积极性创造性，这是恢复与发展生产，建设城市，实现城市对乡村领导的基本保证。
    石家庄焦作等城市工人运动的经验证明，各地工人对学习都有着极高度的热忱，他们要求学政治、文化、技术，各地党委职工会及工厂行政部门必须认真地对工人进行教育工作，首先要把政治教育工作做好。这是一个极其重要的任务。
