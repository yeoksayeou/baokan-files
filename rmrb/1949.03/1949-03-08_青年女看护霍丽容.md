　　Young Nurse Huo Lirong
　　Li Fuchang
　　Huo Lirong is a young nurse in the Third Department of the North China International Peace Hospital. She is only seventeen years old this year. She has a red, chubby face, is not tall, but is very strong, and always has a smile on her face when she speaks. Her family background is that of poor peasants. Her father died when she was very young, and when she was ten years old, her mother also passed away. Only her elder sister, elder brother, and she were left, living a miserable life with nothing to eat or wear, which also tempered her fighting spirit and revolutionary courage.
　　In 1943, her elder sister entered "Lian Da" [United University] to become a nurse. In 1946, her elder brother joined the People's Liberation Army. When she was fifteen years old, she also voluntarily joined the Peace Hospital as a nurse, and her family members all came out to participate in the revolution.
　　Since she started working, with the cultivation and education of the leadership and the help of her comrades, she quickly improved her political awareness and understood that serving the sick and wounded was an supreme honor. Therefore, she was very active and proactive in her work. When she was on duty in the ward, she fetched water, got meals, swept the floor, wiped the tables, brushed the sputum containers, checked temperatures, tidied the beds... She was busy all day long, and sometimes her face was covered in sweat, but she never complained of being tired. When working the night shift, she never dozed off, but constantly patrolled the wards, tucking in the quilts for the sick and wounded, and ensuring they took their medicine on time. When she was not on duty, she often went to the wards to ask about the condition of the sick and wounded, and also helped with the work. When she saw a sick or wounded person wearing too little clothing, or going out without buttoning their coat or wearing a hat, she always cheerfully offered her opinion. When the New Year came, the superiors told her to rest for a few days (with other comrades caring for the wards). When the hospital showed a movie, and everyone went to see it, she still cared about the sick and wounded, and often went to the wards to check on them.
　　Her academic performance is even more amazing. Before joining the workforce, she had never attended school for a single day and could not recognize a single character. Because of her hard work, she can now read the newspaper. Her pockets are always filled with books, notebooks, and pencils, and she studies whenever she has a little time. Whenever she encounters a character she doesn't recognize, she asks the literate sick and wounded people. People praise her for studying actively, and she says, "Without culture, I can't even read health books and newspapers, how can I serve the people more?"
　　It is precisely because of her active work and diligent study that the hospital's wall newspaper constantly has fast-paced rhymes and articles praising her. The sick and wounded comrades were also touched and often gave her things, but she politely declined them all. Only one comrade gave her a copy of "How to Be a Good Communist Party Member," with the inscription "I hope you will take your work and study to the next level and strive to become a glorious Communist Party member. ..." After she read it, she happily accepted the book and said, "I will definitely do so!"

　　青年女看护霍丽容
    李福昌
    霍丽容是华北国际和平医院三部的女看护，今年刚十七岁。红胖胖的脸，个儿不高，但很壮，说话脸上总带着笑容。她家里是贫农成份，从不记事的时候，父亲便死了，十岁那年，母亲又去世，只剩下姐姐、哥哥和她三个人，没吃没穿，孤苦伶仃地过着苦难的生活，也就锻炼了她的斗争性和革命的勇气。
    一九四三年，姐姐进了“联大”当看护，一九四六年，哥哥参加了解放军。她十五岁那年，也自愿参加了和平医院任看护员的工作，家里的人都出来参加革命了。
    她自参加工作后，经领导上的培养教育与同志们的帮助，很快的提高了政治觉悟、懂得了为伤病员服务是无上的光荣，因此她在工作上也就非常积极、主动。在病房值班时，她打水，打饭，扫地，擦桌，刷痰筒，检查体温，整理病床，……一天到晚忙个不停，有时汗流满脸，也不说累。值夜班时，她从没瞌睡过，总是不断的到各病房巡视，给伤病员盖被子，使他们能按时服药，她不值班时，只要有时间，也常到病房里问伤病员情况，还顺便帮助工作。遇见伤病员穿衣少，或不扣衣不戴帽子出门，她总是开心地提出意见。新年到了，上级叫她休息几天（由其他同志护理病房），医院里演电影，大家都去看，她却照旧关心伤病员，时时到病房里去看看。
    她的学习成绩更是惊人，参加工作以前，一天学校没上，一个字也不认识，由于她努力学习，现在能看报了。她的口袋里总不离书，笔记本、铅笔，只要有一点工夫便学习。一有不认识的字，便去问识字的伤病员，人们称赞她学习积极，她说：“没文化，连卫生书和报纸也看不了，怎能为人民更多的服务呢？”
    正是由于她的积极工作，努力学习，医院的墙报上不断有表扬她的快板与文章，伤病员同志们也被感动得常常送给她东西，可是她都善意的谢绝了。只有一个同志，赠给她的一本“怎样做一个好的共产党员，”书上赠言“希望你把工作学习再提高一步，争取做一个光荣的共产党员。……”她看了后才很高兴的把书接受了，并说：“我一定这样做！”
