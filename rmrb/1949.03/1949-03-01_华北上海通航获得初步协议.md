　　North China-Shanghai Navigation Reaches Preliminary Agreement
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th】Preliminary agreement has been reached on the opening of navigation between the North China Liberated Area and Shanghai. In recent days, Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government Bo Yibo, Minister of Agriculture Song Shaowen, and Mayor of Beiping Ye Jianying have held discussions in Beiping for several days with Shanghai shipping industry representatives, including Wei Wenhan. They have reached a consensus in principle on issues such as the exchange of transportation materials, passenger transport, and postal communication, and are now studying specific details. It is reported that eight ships, including Nanqiang, Yudong, Huasheng, Haiti, Yongxing, Ziping, Fuxiang, and Taiwan, will take turns traveling between North China and Shanghai. It is expected that the "Great Shanghai" ship, departing from Shanghai North to Qinhuangdao on the 26th of this month, will carry 1,500 bundles of mail. When the ship returns south, it will carry mail sent from the liberated areas to the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
