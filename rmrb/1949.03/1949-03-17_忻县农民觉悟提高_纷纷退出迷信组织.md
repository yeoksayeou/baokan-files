[Jinzhong Electric] Xinxian peasants have raised their level of awareness during the land reform and are resigning from feudal superstitious organizations in droves. During the land reform movement, various districts exposed the reactionary nature of feudal groups. Some villages even convened mass meetings to discuss the crimes of feudal superstitious organizations such as "Yiguan Dao" and "Puji Buddhism," and combined this with explanations of the North China People's Government's proclamation on disbanding feudal superstitious organizations, enabling the masses to recognize the harm these feudal superstitious organizations were doing to them. Currently, those who have resigned from these superstitious organizations include more than 40 households in Xia Cao Village, 14 households in Huangjia Village, and 40 households in Liansi Gou. They also used practical examples to expose the deception of the Daoist and secret societies. For example, Lu Tianhuai from Pingshe Village said: "When we got sick, they said that as long as you joined the Dao, you would definitely get better, so we were muddleheaded and paid three silver dollars." Women in Dong Village, Fourth District, said after resigning from Yiguan Dao: "This is the end of that! We will never believe in it again." All those who have resigned from the Daoist societies are participating in land reform and preparing for production with ease and joy.

　　忻县农民觉悟提高
  　纷纷退出迷信组织
    【晋中电】忻县农民在土地改革中提高了觉悟程度，纷纷退出封建迷信组织。各区在土地改革运动中曾揭破封建团体的反动面目。有的村曾专门召开群众会议，讨论“一贯道”、“普济佛教”等封建迷信组织的罪恶，并结合讲解华北人民政府关于解散封建迷信组织的布告，使群众认识了这些封建迷信组织对自己的毒害。现在从这些迷信组织内退出者，下曹村有四十余户，黄家庄有十四户，连寺沟四十户。他们并以实际例子揭破道门会门的欺骗。如平社村吕天怀说：“咱们病了，他们说只要你入了道，病一定好，咱就迷迷惑惑出了三块白洋。”四区东村妇女在退出一贯道后说：“这可把罐子打了，咱们可再不要信它了。”凡是退出道门的人，都轻松愉快地参加土地改革与准备生产。
