　　Determined to Achieve Merit to Repay the Folks Back Home

　　A large batch of comfort goods were sent from the distant northeast homeland and delivered to the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Pingjin area. The comrades were overjoyed, deeply appreciating the care of the people of the Northeast for their own soldiers. This gave immense encouragement to the ongoing political rectification and the upcoming southward campaign. The comrades believed that only by going south to eliminate the reactionaries could they be worthy of the hopes of the folks back home. The beautifully crafted letter of greetings from the Northeast Party, government, army, and people, printed with images of advancing into Pingjin after the liberation of Northeast China, and then pointing the spearhead towards Jiangnan from Pingjin, read: "In the three years of the Liberation War in the Northeast, under the wise command of General Lin Biao, you thoroughly annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and liberated all the people of the Northeast. The people of the Northeast will never forget the great achievements you created with your blood and flesh." "We warmly care about everything about you, care about your health, care about your new victories; we hope that you will further display the spirit of heroic and tenacious combat, and engage in a revolutionary heroic competition with the brother troops inside the customs, and strike down to Jiangnan as soon as possible to liberate all of China." "Our entire military and civilians in the rear are stepping up production to support you!"

　　Although these comfort goods were not particularly rare, the profound significance was experienced by every comrade. They believed that only by fulfilling the instructions of the folks back home without fail could they live up to their hopes. After receiving the comfort goods, the comrades of the Machine Gun and Artillery Company of the 375th Regiment of a certain division expressed their determination to carry the revolution to the end to repay the care of the people of the Northeast. Bian Liancheng, a soldier who joined the army after being liberated, returned from the training ground and said to his comrades, "I am really sorry to the elders in the Northeast. I have been in the army for more than a year and have not even achieved a small merit. You will see when we go down to Jiangnan in the future! If I don't achieve any merit, I will never take any more comfort goods!"

　　After the comfort goods were distributed, the new comrades who had not participated in the liberation of the Northeast felt that they had not contributed much to the liberation of the Northeast, and expressed their determination to go across the Yangtze River in the future to make meritorious service to thank the people of the Northeast. Zhao Ren, a newly liberated soldier from Huailai, took a pair of undershorts from his squad leader, blushed, and said with shame, "I have no merit in the liberation of the Northeast. Only by making meritorious service in the future when fighting across the river can I repay you!" Yin Gui, another newly liberated soldier from Huailai, took the cigarettes given to him by Squad Leader Six and said with emotion, "This cigarette is not close to us, it was sent by the people of the Northeast from thousands of miles away. When we smoke this cigarette, we must think carefully and not forget their intentions. We must fight across the Jiangnan and do what they told us to do, and liberate the whole country to be worthy of their kindness." Zhan Yongchun, the deputy squad leader of the Sixth Squad, said in a firm tone after reading the letter of condolences: "Not to mention crossing the Yangtze River, I am not afraid even of going up the mountain of knives. Only by carrying the revolution to the end can we be worthy of the condolences of the people!"

　　After receiving the comfort goods, a certain unit of the 45th Army immediately held a meeting to discuss how to respond to the people of the Northeast with practical actions. Some units formulated specific conditions and were determined to implement them in their combat work: 1. Resolutely follow Chairman Mao to carry the revolution to the end; 2. Strengthen political study and overcome all difficulties; 3. Be brave in combat and active in work; 4. Abide by policies and discipline, and cherish the interests of the people. All the comrades of the Machine Gun and Artillery Company of the Third Battalion of a certain regiment put the letters of greetings in their pockets. They said: "This is a souvenir of the liberation of the Northeast. This glory cannot be bought with money. Reading it a few more times will really help our work."

　　决心立功回答故乡父老
    从辽远的东北故乡寄来了大批慰劳品，送到驻平津地区的人民解放军后，同志们乐的手舞足蹈，深深体念到东北人民对子弟兵的关怀。对正在进行的政治整训和即将南下作战，给以莫大的鼓舞。同志们认为：只有南下消灭反动派，才算对得住家乡父老的希望。印着东北解放后进军平津，又从平津将矛头指向江南的十分华丽精制的东北党政军民的慰问信上写着：“东北三年的解放战争中，你们在林彪将军的英明指挥下，彻底的消灭了蒋家匪军，解放了全东北人民，你们用血肉创造的丰功伟绩，东北人民是永远不会忘记的。”“我们热烈的关怀着你们的一切，关怀着你们的健康，关怀着你们新的胜利；希望你们更加发挥英勇顽强的作战精神，和关内兄弟部队作革命的英雄竞赛，早日打到江南去，解放全中国。”“我们后方全体军民，正在加紧生产，支援你们！”
    虽然这些慰劳品，不是更稀奇的东西，但是意义的深长，是每个同志都设身处地的体验到了，他们认为把家乡父老的咐嘱不折不扣的作到，才算不辜负人家的希望。某师三七五团机炮连同志在接获慰劳品后，纷纷的表示决心，要将革命进行到底，回答东北人民的关怀。翻身参军的战士卞连城从操场回来，对同志们说：“我真对不起东北父老，参军一年多连个小功也没立上，今后下江南你们看着吧！不立功，我就再不拿慰问品！”
    慰问品发下后，没参加解放东北战斗的新同志，感觉自己对解放东北没啥贡献，都表示决心在今后打过长江去，立功答谢东北人民。怀来新解放来的战士赵仁，接过班长给他的一件衬裤，红着脸惭愧的说：“我对解放东北没有功，只有将来过江作战立功，再重谢吧！”另一个怀来新解放来的战士尹贵拿了六班长给他的纸烟，感动的说：“这支烟不近哪，是东北老百姓千程百里送来的，咱抽这支烟，可要好好想想，不能忘了人家这番意思，咱要打过江南去，把人家指给咱的事办到，把全国都给解放了，才算对起人家这片心。”六班副詹永春看完慰问信后，用坚强的音调说：“别说是过长江，就是上刀山我也不怕，只有革命到底，才对得起人家的慰问！”
    四十五军某部接到慰问品后，立即开会座谈，要以实际行动回答东北人民。有的单位订出了具体条件，下决心在战斗工作中贯彻：一、坚决跟着毛主席革命到底；二、加强学好政治，克服一切困难；三、作战勇敢工作积极；四、遵守政策纪律，爱护人民利益。某团三营机炮连全体同志，把慰问信都装在衣袋里，他们说：“这是解放东北的纪念品，这光荣花钱买不着，多看几遍，对咱工作真有帮助。”
