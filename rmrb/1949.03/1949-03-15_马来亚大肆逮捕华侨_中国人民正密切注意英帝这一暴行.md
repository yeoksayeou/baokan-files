　　Malaya Massively Arrests Overseas Chinese
    Chinese People Are Closely Watching This Atrocity of British Imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Singapore on the 11th, official statistics from Kuala Lumpur show that since the so-called "New Emergency Regulations" were promulgated on January 10th of this year, 3,620 overseas Chinese have been arrested. Among them, 680 have already been deported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and the remaining arrested will be deported successively. The British imperialists' large-scale persecution of overseas Chinese is being carried out simultaneously with their armed suppression of the Malayan national liberation movement, which began last June. According to incomplete figures released by the British authorities in Malaya, since last June, the number of overseas Chinese arrested has reached 8,000 to 9,000. The Chinese people are closely watching this atrocity of British imperialism in persecuting our compatriots.

　　马来亚大肆逮捕华侨
    中国人民正密切注意英帝这一暴行
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据美联社新加坡十一日电：按吉隆坡官方统计，自今年一月十日所谓“新紧急条例”颁布以来，已有华侨三千六百二十人被捕。其中已有六百八十人被遣送至国民党统治区，其余被捕者也将被陆续遣送。英帝国主义者大规模迫害华侨的暴行，是和它去年六月开始的对马来亚民族解放运动的武装镇压同时进行的。据马来亚英国当局公布的不完全数字，自去年六月迄今，华侨被捕者已达八、九千人。中国人民正密切注意英帝国主义的这一迫害我同胞的暴行。
