To Reduce Intermediate Exploitation and Strengthen Urban-Rural Ties

Zhangjiakou Municipal Government Provides Large Loans
Vigorously Supporting Cooperatives
More Than Thirty Various Cooperatives Have Been Organized

[Zhangjiakou News] In order to develop the cooperative economy in Zhangjiakou, the municipal government issued loans of 878,260 yuan in Renminbi and vigorously supported the organization of various cooperatives with a focus. Currently, eleven production cooperatives have been organized, including six workers' cooperatives, two women's production (shoe sole making, wool spinning, thread spinning) cooperatives, one bean sprout shop, and two shoe-making cooperatives, with a total of more than 470 members. Twenty-two street consumer cooperatives have been organized, with a total of 12,200 members. There are two consumer cooperatives in enterprises and factories. On the original basis, it helped 41 small shops and factories (iron factories, cigarette factories, shoe making, thread spinning, weaving, oil extraction, etc.) to resume or change their business. A total of 550 households were organized to engage in production, ensuring the lives of 3,072 people; and a large number of necessities were supplied to the members. For example, the amount of homespun cloth was 20,337 bolts, cotton 8,730 catties, and food more than 1.1 million catties, which reduced intermediate exploitation and strengthened urban-rural relations.

The production cooperatives have the following three forms: (1) Labor cooperatives that collectively contract projects. For example, the mason and tiler cooperative relies solely on labor and technology for a living. They are divided into contracting and design groups, carpentry groups, bricklaying groups, and coolie groups according to different technologies. In addition to uniformly contracting projects, they also make their own products for sale. The income is paid according to the market price according to the quality of the technology, and the surplus is used as production funds within the cooperative to expand reproduction. In terms of labor use, labor and technology are planned and controlled according to the size and quality of the project. Surplus labor can be used for production within the cooperative, and wages are paid according to the piece rate. (2) Small handicraft cooperatives. For example, the shoe-making cooperative in the Seventh District has 30 cooperative workers. They only recommend seven people to handle the sorting work in the factory, and wages are paid according to the work. The rest of the people are organized into groups to carry out shoe sole production under unified leadership, and wages are calculated on a piece-rate basis. The cooperative produces 50 pairs of shoes a day. In half a month, in addition to paying wages of 900 catties of rice, it also earned 800 yuan, and drove 48 poor women outside the factory to make shoe soles. (3) Cooperatives that combine production and marketing. For example, the thread spun by women in the Nancaoyuan area is directly sold by the marketing team in exchange for grain.

　　减轻中间剥削密切城乡关系
    张垣市府大量贷款
    大力扶植合作社
    已组织起各种合作社卅余个
    【张垣讯】为发展张家口市合作经济，市政府发放人民币八十七万八千二百六十元的贷款，并用大力有重点的扶助了各种合作社的组织。现已组织起生产合作社十一个，其中有工人合作社六个，妇女生产（纳鞋底、纺毛、纺线）合作社两个，豆芽铺一座，做鞋合作社两个，共有社员四百七十余名。组织了街道消费合作社二十二个，共有社员一万二千二百名。企业工厂消费社两个。在旧有基础上，帮助了四十一个小型店、厂（铁厂、烟厂、做鞋、纺线、织布、熬油等）复业与转业。共组织了五百五十户从事生产，使三千零七十二口人的生活有了保证；并大量供给了社员必需品，只土布一项即有两万零三百三十七匹，棉花八千七百三十斤，食粮一百一十多万斤，减轻了中间剥削，密切了城乡关系。
    生产性的合作社有以下三种形式：（一）集体包揽工程的劳力合作社。如泥工瓦工合作社，是专靠劳力技术为生的，他们按着不同的技术，分成包工设计组、木工组、瓦匠组苦力、组等，除统一向外包揽工程外，还自制成品向外出售。所得收入，按技术优劣照市价发资，盈余归社内为生产资金，扩大再生产。在劳力使用上，按工程的大小，质量高低，有计划的支配劳力和技术。剩余劳动力，可在社内进行生产，按件记工发资。（二）小型手工业的合作社。如七区做鞋合作社，三十个社员工人，他们只推七个人在厂内办理整顿活计，按工发资，其余的人编成小组，在统一领导下进行纳鞋底生产，按件记工折资，合作社每天出鞋五十双，半月来除付工资米九百斤，还赚八百元，并带动了厂外四十八个贫苦妇女纳鞋底。（三）生产与运销相结合的合作社。如南菜园妇女纺的线等，直接让运销组卖出去，换回粮食来。
