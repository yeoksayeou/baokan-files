　　Fushan Fourth District Smallpox Epidemic
  　Mass Vaccination Under Preparation
    [Taiyue Telegram] Smallpox is spreading in Qu Lianzai and Bei Yuanshang villages in the Fourth District of Fushan. Qu Lianzai is a small mountain village that did not believe in vaccination in the past. Last December, smallpox spread to the village. People neither sought medical treatment nor isolated the sick from the healthy, but only burned incense and kowtowed to the so-called "Smallpox Goddess." As a result, smallpox spread greatly. Out of only seventeen households in the entire village, more than a dozen adults and children contracted smallpox. Qiao Fengming's nephew, Qiao Mingchang, a 20-year-old young man, suffered from smallpox. He did not seek medical treatment, but only burned incense and kowtowed, which resulted in the death of a healthy young nephew. When smallpox was spreading in Bei Yuanshang Village, some sorceresses took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that they had dreamed that the "Smallpox Goddess" had sown black beans in the village, which was a harbinger of children developing smallpox. This caused unrest among the people. They also said: "If you nail a pot lid on your shoulder, and a small snake coils on the pot lid, you will not be afraid of getting smallpox." For a time, all the children in Bei Yuanshang Village had small pot lids nailed to their shoulders (an object made of sorghum stalks connected with thread, resembling a peasant's pot lid with a small snake coiled on it). As a result, smallpox spread more and more. Only then did the masses wake up and realize that superstition was useless. At the same time, they also discovered that those who had been vaccinated only had a fever for a few days and then recovered. Therefore, the masses went to the hospital to get vaccinated one after another. In order to eradicate smallpox, Fushan Yongsheng Pharmacy and two other pharmacies specially sent people to Yuci and Taigu to purchase vaccine lymph on February 10th, and they will return to the county for mass vaccination within half a month.

　　浮山四区天花流行
  　刻正准备大量施种牛痘
    【太岳电】浮山四区曲里安子、北垣上等村在天花流行中。曲里安子是个小山庄，过去都不相信种牛痘，去年腊月，天花就传到村里，大家既不请医生治疗，也不把病人和好人隔离开，只是给所谓“痘儿娘娘”烧香磕头，结果，天花大大流行起来，全村仅十七户，就有十几个大人小孩害天花。乔凤鸣的侄儿乔明昌，廿岁的小伙子害天花，不请医生，光烧香磕头，结果把一个年青力壮的好侄儿送了命。北垣上村天花流行时，一些妖婆子就趁风扬尘，说她们梦见“痘儿娘娘”把一毛黑豆播在村里了，这就是孩子们出天花的先兆。弄得人心不安。又说什么：“肩上钉锅盖，锅盖上盘小蛇，就不怕生天花。”一时北垣上全村小孩们的肩上，都钉起小小的锅盖（以高粱秆用线连在一起的一种物件，象农民盖的锅盖上盘一条小蛇）。这样天花越传越多，群众这才醒悟过来，认清迷信不顶用，同时，他们也发现种过牛痘的人传染上，只发几天烧就好了。因此，群众才纷纷到医院去种牛痘。刻浮山永盛药房等三家药铺，为了扑灭天花，已于二月十日特别派人到榆次、太谷买痘苗，半月内即可返县大量施种。
