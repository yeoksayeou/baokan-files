　　Australia - is an island nation between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, belonging to Oceania. It has an area of 7.7 million square kilometers and a population of 7.3 million. Although only 2% of the island is arable, agricultural products are abundant compared to the population, and wheat is exported annually. The main product of the island is wool, with a production of 117.2 million pounds in 1943, the highest in the world. The mineral resources of gold, silver, lead, and iron are also quite abundant. Since the British forces invaded in 1788, Australia has become a colony of British imperialism. On January 1, 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia was formed, becoming one of the British "Dominions." The British government appointed a Governor-General to manage the federal government affairs, and the Australian people lost their rights to independence and autonomy in politics and suffered from the brutal exploitation of Britain in the economy. After World War II, Britain's rule in Australia weakened, and American imperialism took the opportunity to buy raw materials and dump goods, competing with Britain for oppression and exploitation of Australia.

    澳大利亚——是太平洋与印度洋之间的一个岛国，属大洋洲。面积七百七十万方公里，人口七百三十万。岛上虽然只有百分之二的可耕面积，但与人口数目相比，农产品是很丰富的，每年还有小麦输出；岛上主要出产是羊毛，一九四三年产量达十一万七千二百万磅，为世界第一；矿产中金、银、铅及铁的蕴藏量也很不少。澳大利亚自一七八八年英国势力侵入以后，就开始成了英国帝国主义的殖民地。一九零一年一月一日组成澳大利亚联邦，为英国“自治领”之一，由英国派总督管理联邦政务，澳大利亚人民在政治上失去了独立自主权利，在经济上受到了英国的残酷剥削。第二次世界大战以后，英国在澳大利亚的统治削弱了，美帝国主义趁机而来，买进原料，倾销商品，正与英国竞争着对澳大利亚进行压迫与剥削。
