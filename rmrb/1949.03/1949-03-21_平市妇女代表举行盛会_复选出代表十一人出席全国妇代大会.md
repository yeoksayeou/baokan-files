　　Ping City Women Representatives Hold Grand Meeting
    Re-elect Eleven Representatives to Attend the National Women's Congress
    [Our Newspaper] The eleven representatives from the Beiping area to attend the First National Congress of Chinese Women were formally elected yesterday (the 20th) at the re-election meeting convened by the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Democratic Women's Federation. At the same time, 33 representatives to attend the North China Women's Congress were also elected. The re-election meeting was solemnly held at the auditorium of the North Building of Peking University at 2:00 pm yesterday. A total of 49 units participated in the election of representatives, with a total of 85 candidates. The election was conducted simultaneously in five groups: workers, students, professional groups, female cadres of organs, and military dependents. After heated discussions in each group and self-introductions by the candidates, the election was conducted using a direct, anonymous ballot method. As a result, Li Mengzhen and ten others were elected as formal representatives of the Beiping area to attend the First National Congress of Chinese Women, and Fang Ye was elected as an alternate representative.
    In addition, 33 representatives to attend the North China Women's Congress were also elected at the meeting. The representatives elected to the National Women's Congress expressed their feelings one after another. Female worker Li Mengzhen said: In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, our workers suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. Today, under the leadership of the People's Government, we workers have obtained many rights for the first time. We should raise our awareness and step up production. This time I was elected as a representative, and I must bring the opinions of our workers to the congress. Female worker Xu Shirong said: In the past, workers were always considered lowly by others, but now the workers are liberated, and we have recognized our own strength. We should step up production and support the front lines.
    The list of eleven representatives elected to attend the National Women's Congress is as follows: Li Mengzhen (female worker of the Fourth Garment Factory), Xu Shirong (female worker of the First Garment Factory), Wu Yuzhen (female worker of the Second Garment Factory), Yang Zaoxin (female worker of the Telecommunications Bureau), Li Yun (female employee of the Pingjin Railway Bureau), Cui Junjie (student of Tsinghua University), Liu Shihui (student of the Attached Middle School of the Normal University), Liu Junying (female middle school teacher), Wu Chaoxiang (political worker of the 41st Army), Ling Sha (staff member of the Education Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government).
