　　Intensify and Expand Activities Behind Enemy Lines
  　Greek Democratic Army Establishes Underground Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd] Reports from various sources: Major General Bazotas, Political Commissar of the Supreme Command of the Greek Democratic Army, recently declared to a group of officers attending the "Political Workers School in Enemy-Occupied Cities and Villages" that underground units of the Democratic Army must be organized in the areas occupied by the Greek royalist fascists. These units will be the "third front" for Greek democrats, and they must crush the enemy's operational agencies and mobilize reserves for the Democratic Army.
    In the city of Yannitsa (northern Thessaly), occupied by the royalist army, underground troops under the leadership of the Democratic Army's political commissar laid mines, killing and wounding a number of royalist fascists. In the city of Godounisa, occupied by the royalist fascists, as a result of activities by underground troops under the leadership of the Democratic Army's political commissar, more than one hundred royalist fascists were killed or wounded.
    The central organ of the Greek Communist Party, "Rizospastis" (which was banned by the royalist fascists in October 1947), has been re-published and is secretly circulating in all areas held by the royalist fascists.

　　深入扩大敌后活动
  　希民主军建立地下军
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方报导：希腊民主军最高统帅部政治委员巴佐塔斯少将，顷对在“敌占区城乡政治工作人员学校”听讲的一批军官宣称：在希腊保皇法西斯占领区，必须组织民主军地下部队。这些部队将是希腊民主分子的“第三条战线”，他们必须粉碎敌人的作战机构，并为民主军动员后备军。
    在保皇军占领的杨尼萨城（色萨利北部），民主军政委领导下的地下军埋设地雷，毙炸炸伤若干保皇法西斯分子。在保皇法西斯占领的高斗尼萨城，民主军政委领导下的地下军进行活动的结果，有一百余名保皇法西斯分子毙命或受伤。
    希共中央机关报“里佐斯巴斯底斯”（该报曾于一九四七年十月被保皇法西斯查封）已经复刊，该报已在保皇法西斯所有地区秘密流传着。
