　　Prevention and Treatment of Scabies
　　Deng Yuwen
　　Symptoms of scabies: Scabies rashes are generally millet-sized to sorghum-sized, light red, bright red, or normal skin-colored rashes, scattered on the skin surface, gradually turning into blisters, then rupturing and turning into pustules, quickly spreading to nearby areas. The scabies mite is found in the area where blisters or pustules have formed, about 1-2 millimeters wide and several millimeters to 2-3 centimeters long, appearing as grayish-white or light black thin lines. This is the path the scabies mite travels and where it lays its eggs. It is easily visible under light at night. Because scabies mites are afraid of light, they do not dare to come out during the day, so there is no itching. Once night falls, the mites become active, causing severe itching, even preventing sleep.

　　Common areas of occurrence are between the fingers, on the wrists, and on the front and back of joints. From there, it spreads to the chest, genitals, and buttocks, and eventually to the inner thighs. Sometimes it also spreads to the face or other parts. Scabies must be diagnosed based on the presence of rashes, blisters, pustules, scabies mites, and severe itching at night as described above. Do not mistake other rashes or venereal diseases for scabies, otherwise, treatment will be ineffective.

　　Prevention: Scabies is spread through contact, with person-to-person transmission being the most common. Secondly, wearing the clothes of someone with scabies or using their belongings can also transmit the disease. Therefore, if there are people with scabies in a unit, they should be gathered in one room and isolated from those without scabies. Their belongings should not be mixed. Those who have been cured in this room should have their belongings disinfected. Items that can be boiled should be boiled for half an hour. Items that cannot be boiled should be placed in direct sunlight for two weeks before being moved to another isolation room. After staying there for two weeks, they can rejoin the group to avoid the risk of transmission. Patients in the isolation room should frequently wash and sun their clothes and belongings.

　　Treatment: It is best not to change underwear and belongings during the entire treatment period, as each change contaminates another item. Although boiling can kill adult mites, it does not solve the problem of the eggs. After being cured, change to uncontaminated items and disinfect the contaminated items before reuse.

　　1. Ointment application therapy: 30% sulfur petrolatum is best; other sulfur-containing ointments are also effective. When applying, take a small amount of ointment, apply it for a while, so that the medicine is absorbed into the skin, and then warm it with fire. Apply the ointment to areas without scabies, except for the head, face, and genitals. It is best to apply the ointment and warm it together in a room, as some of the sulfur vapor is inhaled into the body, which is even more effective. Apply the ointment for six days, take a bath on the seventh day, and start the same treatment as the first time in the second week. This method is effective for dry scabies (papular).

　　2. Sulfur treatment: Make a thin emulsion with sulfur, immerse the whole body in it for about ten minutes, except for the head and face. Then, come out and warm yourself near a fire. Do not wipe with a towel to avoid wiping off the sulfur. Wash like this for six days, and on the seventh day, wash with clean water to remove all the sulfur from the body. This is one course of treatment. If it is not effective, start another week as the first time. This is effective for wet scabies (vesicular and pustular).

　　3. Sulfur oil or water application therapy: Some water solutions need to be diluted with water, otherwise, they can burn the skin. Usually add two or three parts of water and apply it to the body, also like the above two treatments. Take a bath on the seventh day.

　　In the above three treatments, it is best not to use soap or alkali for bathing and washing the face, because it irritates the skin and easily causes eczema or impetigo. Do not drink alcohol or eat irritating foods.

　　Are injections useful? Sometimes calcium chloride or arsenic preparations can be used for long-term cases or lichenification. But the main focus is on prevention and isolation.

　　疥的预防和治疗
    邓郁文
    疥的病状：疥疹普遍是小米粒大到高粱米粒大的淡红色、或者是鲜红色、或者是普通皮肤色的疹，散在皮肤面上，以后渐次变成水疱，再破裂变成脓疱，很快的传染到旁的地方。疥虫是在水疱或脓疱经过的地方，宽约一米毫到二米毫，长约数米毫到二、三米厘的灰白色或淡黑色的细线，这是疥虫走的道，并在那里产卵，夜间在灯光下很容易看出来。疥虫因为怕光，白天不敢出来活动，所以不痒，一到夜间，疥虫就出来活动，痒的厉害，甚至不能睡觉。
    发生部位普通是在指间、手腕和关节的前后面，由此再传到胸膛部、阴部和臀部，最后传染到大腿的内面，有时也传到颜面或其他的部份。疥必须是如以上所说的那样发疹水疱、脓疱，疥虫和夜间痒的厉害等条件，不能随便把出疹子，或洋梅痘子都算疥，不然的话治病不会见效的。
    预防法：疥是接触传染，人传染人的情形最多。其次是穿生疥人的衣服，或使生疥人的东西都能传染。所以，如在一个单位内有生疥的人，都应当集聚在一个屋内，与没有生疥的人施行隔离，东西也不可以混用。在这个屋内治好的人要把自己的东西施行消毒。能煮沸的东西，最好煮半个钟头，不能煮的东西拿在外边日光下晒两个礼拜，以后搬入另外的隔离室，住两个礼拜，再与群众住在一起，才不会有传染的危险。住在隔离室的病人，要经常洗晒自己的衣服和用物。
    治疗法：全治疗期内，最好不换内衣及用物，因为换一件污染一件，虽经煮沸能杀灭成虫，但对于虫卵尚有问题。已经好了后，再换没有污染的东西，把已经污染的东西消毒再用。
    一、软膏涂擦疗法，用百分之三十的硫黄凡士林最好，其他含有硫黄的软膏都行。擦的时候应当注意取少量的软膏，多擦一个时候，使药都浸润到皮肤内，再用火烤一烤。除掉头部、颜面、阴部以外，没有疥的地方也要擦上软膏。最好集体在一个屋子内擦软膏及烤，因为有一部份硫黄蒸气被吸入体内更有效力。用软膏涂擦到六天，第七天洗澡，第二周再开始作与第一次相同的疗法。此法对干疥（丘疹性）有效。
    二、硫黄治疗法：用硫黄作成稀薄乳剂，除头部，颜面外，全浸在里面约十分钟，出来到有火的地方烤一烤，不要用手巾擦，免得把硫黄擦掉。这样洗六天，到第七天用白水洗，把身上附着的硫黄全洗掉，这是一个疗法。不好的时候，下周开始照第一次一样再作一周，这样对湿疥（水疱脓疱性）有效。
    三、用硫黄油剂或水剂涂擦疗法，有的水剂尚须要加水稀薄，不然能把皮肤烧破了。普通加上两份、三份水，再涂抹到身上，也象上边那两种疗法一样，第七天洗澡。
    上边三种疗法中洗澡和洗脸最好不用肥皂或硷，因为刺戟皮肤，容易起湿疹或脓痂疹，不要喝酒和吃有刺戟的东西。
    注射药是否有用？有时因为时期长，或有苔癣变性时用盐化钙或者砒素制剂也行。但主要在预防和隔离。
