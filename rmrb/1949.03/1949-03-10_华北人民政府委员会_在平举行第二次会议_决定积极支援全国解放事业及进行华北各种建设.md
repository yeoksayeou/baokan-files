Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 8th. The North China People's Government Committee held its second government committee meeting in Beiping from the 21st to the 25th of last month. The government members who attended this meeting were Dong Biwu, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Teng Daiyuan, Lan Gongwu, Yang Xiufeng, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, Chen Jinkun, Xie Juezai, Ling Biying, Huang Zhefu, Nan Hanchen, Zhang Su, Song Shaowen, Zhao Erlu, Yu Li (Dong Luan), Yin Xipeng, Xing Zhaotang, Jia Xinzhai, Rong Zihe, Xu Zheng, Wang Fufen, Liu Yuchen, and other 24 people. Three members, Xu Xiangqian, Huang Jing, and Xue Xun, were unable to attend due to official duties. More than 40 people, including the heads of various government departments who had arrived in Beiping and personnel above the section chief level, attended the meeting as observers.

	Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, gave a systematic report at the meeting on the work of the government in the five months since its establishment, elaborating that the government's work during this period focused on supporting the People's Liberation War, restoring and developing production, and rectifying the political style. In the great cause of liberating all of North China, the people of the North China Liberated Area, especially the vast number of peasants and employees of various enterprises, made great efforts while enthusiastically producing and bravely participating in the war. At the same time, he pointed out that there were also shortcomings in the work during this period, such as the phenomenon of wasting manpower and materials in supporting the front lines; in the financial and trade sectors, due to insufficient attention to the destructive nature of speculative capital, market management had not yet achieved the due results; and an unstructured and undisciplined state still existed in certain departments and certain local governments. Chairman Dong pointed out that the central task of the entire region in the future is to actively support the national people's liberation cause and carry out various constructions in North China, and closely combine the two. Chairman Dong also submitted written drafts to the committee regarding this year's administrative plan and financial budget. The administrative plan is divided into three aspects: national economic construction, democratic construction, and cultural and educational construction.

	The participating members discussed Chairman Dong's report and believed that the government's work implemented the administrative guidelines decided by the North China Provisional People's Congress, and unanimously approved it. Subsequently, they listened to the main responsible persons of the government's various departments for a brief explanation of the administrative plan and budget案, and then organized four review groups: (1) the National Economic Construction Plan Review Group, with Committee Member Yang Xiufeng as the convener; (2) the Democratic Construction Plan Review Group, with Committee Member Xie Juezai as the convener; (3) the Cultural and Educational Construction Plan Review Group, with Committee Member Cheng Fangwu as the convener; (4) the Review Group for the Annual Budget案 and Provisional Audit Regulations (draft), with Committee Member Lan Gongwu as the convener. Each review group absorbed personnel above the section chief level from various government agencies and departments to conduct detailed research on their respective administrative plans and budgets. Then the committee comprehensively discussed the review opinions of each group and revised and approved them. The meeting finally closed after passing some personnel appointment matters.

　　华北人民政府委员会
  　在平举行第二次会议
    决定积极支援全国解放事业及进行华北各种建设
    【新华社北平八日电】华北人民政府于上月二十一日至二十五日在平举行第二次政府委员会会议。出席这次会议的政府委员有董必武、聂荣臻、薄一波、滕代远、蓝公武、杨秀峰、范文澜、成仿吾、陈瑾昆、谢觉哉、凌必应、晃哲甫、南汉宸、张苏、宋劭文、赵尔陆、于力（董鲁安）、殷希彭、邢肇棠、贾心斋、戎子和、徐正、王复分、刘雨辰等廿四人。徐向前、黄敬和薛迅三委员，因公未能来平出席。列席会议者，有业已抵平的政府各部门负责人及处长以上人员四十余人。华北人民政府董必武主席在会议中，将政府成立以来五个月的工作概况，作了系统的报告，阐述政府这一期间工作是着重于支援人民解放战争，恢复和发展生产及整饬政风。在解放全华北的伟大事业中，华北解放区人民特别是广大农民及各企业部门的职工，一面热烈生产，一面英勇参战，尽了极大的努力。他同时指出这一时期的工作也有缺点，例如支援前线上仍有浪费人力物力底现象；金融贸易方面，因对投机资本底破坏性注意不足，因此市场管理上尚未获得应有的成绩；在某些部门及某些地方政府中还存在无组织无纪律状态。董主席指明今后全区中心工作任务为积极支援全国人民解放事业及进行华北的各种建设，并把二者密切结合起来。董主席并向委员会提出了关于本年施政计划及财政预算等书面草案。施政计划分国民经济建设、民主建设及文教建设三方面。与会委员讨论了董主席的报告，认为政府的工作贯彻了华北临时人民代表大会决定的施政方针，一致予以通过。继又听取政府各主管部门对施政计划及预算案的扼要说明，随即组织四个审查小组：（一）国民经济建设计划审查组，以杨委员秀峰为召集人；（二）民主建设计划审查组，以谢委员觉哉为召集人；（三）文化教育建设计划审查组，以成委员仿吾为召集人；（四）本年度预算案及暂行审计条例草案审查组，以蓝委员公武为召集人。各审查小组分别吸收政府各机关部门处长以上人员参加，详细研讨了各该施政计划及预算案等。然后委员会又把各组的审查意见，加以综合讨论后修正通过。会议最后在通过若干人事任命事项后闭幕。
