　　Tongxian and Nanyuan Cotton Ginning Factories
  　Rushing to Process Cotton for Planting

    [Our Newspaper] Since resuming work, the employees of the cotton ginning factories in Tongxian and Nanyuan, which are under the Cotton Production Improvement Office, have shown high morale and unprecedented production efficiency. The Tongxian Cotton Ginning Factory had 380,000 jin of Sz-2 seed cotton in storage at the time of liberation. In order to promote cotton planting this year and provide farmers with high-quality cotton seeds, the factory is striving to gin all the cotton before the planting season. All employees have voluntarily established a work review system to overcome the difficulty of lacking machine parts. At the beginning of operations, the factory ginned 5,000 jin of cotton per day, but now it has increased to over 9,000 jin, breaking the factory's highest ginning record since its establishment. According to the original plan, the entire ginning task will be completed ten days ahead of schedule. The Nanyuan Cotton Ginning Factory was damaged before the liberation of Beiping. After the efforts of all employees to repair it, it officially started work on March 14. In order not to delay planting, they are working overtime day and night to gin the cotton. Each shift averages 5,200 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 700 jin compared to the 4,500 jin per shift before liberation. The amount of cotton ginned is still increasing daily.

　　通县南苑两轧花厂
  　赶着播种加工轧花
    【本报讯】棉产改进处所属通县、南苑两地轧花厂，自复工以来，职工情绪高涨，生产效率空前提高。通县轧花厂解放时存有斯字二号籽棉三十八万斤，为了本年度推广植棉，供给农民优良棉种，争取于播种期前全部轧出，全体职工自动定立工作检讨制度，克服了缺乏机器零件的困难。初开工时每日轧花五千斤，现已增加到九千斤以上，打破该厂建立以来轧花的最高纪录。按照原定计划，提前十日即可完成全部轧花任务。南苑轧花厂于北平解放前遭到破坏，解放后经全体职工努力修复，已于三月十四日正式开工。为了不误播种，昼夜加班赶轧。每班平均轧花五千二百斤。较解放前之每班四千五百斤增加了七百斤。现轧花数量仍在逐日上升中。
