　　The Chinese People Must Liberate Taiwan
    American imperialism is carrying out activities to invade China's territory, Taiwan Province. Last December, when the Kuomintang traitorous and reactionary government suffered a decisive military defeat, the American Associated Press reported the conspiracy of the United States to directly seize Taiwan. The news agency said: The United States National Security Council has suggested to Truman that "defenses must be built on Taiwan and Hainan Island at all costs." Since then, American imperialism's activities to invade Taiwan have been intensified in various forms, such as military, political, economic, diplomatic, and espionage. The American Economic Cooperation Administration's invasion plan in Taiwan has been expanded, and American journalists have reported that the United States will soon "merge" Taiwan's economy with Japan's economy. Earlier this month, the commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, arrived in Taiwan to "inspect" Kaohsiung, Keelung, and other air and naval bases for invading China. MacArthur, the supreme commander of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, recently, through the Taiwanese traitor and American lackey Liao Wenyi and his ilk, issued the so-called demand for "Taiwan independence" and is brewing to submit the so-called Taiwan "independence" issue to the United Nations for discussion, first intending to allow Liao Wenyi to attend the Far Eastern Commission as a so-called representative of the Taiwanese people to raise the same issue. Not only that, MacArthur has even publicly issued the absurd statement that "Taiwan still belongs to the Allied Headquarters before the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan." The purpose of all these conspiratorial activities by American imperialism is to attempt to annex Taiwan. American imperialism's colonial rule in China through its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary派, is about to perish soon, so it is eager to seize a piece of China's territory—Taiwan—as a springboard for launching aggressive wars against the Chinese mainland in the future. At the same time, the Kuomintang reactionary faction headed by Chiang Kai-shek also dreams of relying on the military protection of American imperialism to use Taiwan as a base for its last struggle. Chen Cheng, the pseudo-chairman of Taiwan Province, even stated after Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement" that he would declare Taiwan "independent" when necessary, that is, he would make Taiwan virtually merge with American colonial imperialism.
    However, American imperialists' intention to forcibly occupy Taiwan like Japan did in 1895 is just a dream. Today's China is not the China of fifty-four years ago. Today's Taiwanese people are not the Taiwanese people of fifty-four years ago. Even in the past, during the Japanese occupation, the Taiwanese people had held dozens of armed resistances. And since Taiwan returned to the motherland's map, the will freely expressed by the Taiwanese people is completely opposite to the shouts of the American spy Liao Wenyi and other American running dogs to separate Taiwan Province from China and merge it into the United States. The Taiwanese people have carried out a great and heroic struggle against the enslavement and rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government. To protest American imperialism's aggression against China, on January 9, 1947, tens of thousands of students in Taiwan held a magnificent demonstration, shouting "American troops get out of China." To oppose the tyranny of the American puppet Kuomintang, two years ago, the people of Taiwan Province carried out the "February 28th" movement, which set off a vigorous armed uprising throughout Taiwan. The goal of this struggle of the Taiwanese people is completely the same as the struggle of the people in other provinces of China for liberation, that is, to overthrow the imperialist, feudalist, and bureaucratic capitalist enslavement and rule over the Chinese people and to establish an independent, unified, people's democratic new China, that is, the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the so-called "Taiwan independence movement" is an extreme insult to the Taiwanese people.
    The Chinese people (including the Taiwanese people) will absolutely not tolerate the illegal aggression of American imperialism against Taiwan or any other Chinese territory, and equally absolutely will not tolerate the Kuomintang reactionary faction using Taiwan as a base for its last struggle. The task of the Chinese people's liberation struggle is to liberate all of China, until the liberation of Taiwan, Hainan Island, and every last inch of land belonging to China. Because a tremendous change has taken place in the Chinese situation, the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle must be fully realized in a short time. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and must liberate all of China.

### 中国人民一定要解放台湾

　　中国人民一定要解放台湾
    美国帝国主义正在进行侵略中国的领土台湾省的活动。去年十二月间，当国民党卖国反动政府在军事上遭受决定性的惨败的时候，美国的合众社就传出了美国准备直接攫取台湾的阴谋。该通讯社说：美国国家安全委员会已向杜鲁门建议。“必须以一切代价在台湾和海南岛建设防务”。自此以后，美国帝国主义侵略台湾的活动，即以军事、政治、经济、外交和特务等各种形式更加加紧地进行。美国经济合作总署在台湾的侵略计划已经扩大，美国记者且已传出美国不久就要把台湾经济“合并”于日本经济的消息。美国西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔于本月初曾到达台湾，“巡视”高雄、基隆等海空军侵华基地。美国驻日占领军统帅麦克阿瑟最近经过台湾省汉奸美国奴才廖文毅之流发出了所谓要求“台湾独立”的狂吠，并正酝酿将所谓台湾“独立”问题提交联合国讨论，首先是打算准许廖文毅以所谓台人代表的资格出席远东委员会提出同样的问题。不仅如此，麦克阿瑟且已公然发出“在对日和约签订之前台湾仍属于盟军总部”的荒谬声明。美国帝国主义这一切阴谋活动的目的，就是妄图吞并台湾。美国帝国主义经由其走狗国民党反动派在中国的殖民地统治很快就要灭亡了，因此它急欲相接攫取中国的一块领土——台湾作为将来对中国大陆发动侵略战争的跳板。与此同时，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派，也梦想托庇于美国帝国主义的军事保护下，把台湾作为最后挣扎的根据地。台湾省伪主席陈诚在蒋匪“引退”后且曾表示，在必要时将宣布台湾“独立”，就是说，将使台湾在实际上合并于美国殖民帝国主义。
    但是美国帝国主义者打算象日本在一八九五年那样来强占台湾，不过是在做梦。今天的中国，不是五十四年前的中国了。今天的台湾人民，也不是五十四年前的台湾人民了。就在从前，在日本占领时期，台湾人民也曾举行过几十次武装反抗。而自从台湾重回祖国版图以后，台湾人民所自由表示的意志，更和美国间谍廖文毅和美国的其他走狗要把台湾省从中国分立出去并合并于美国的叫喊完全相反。台湾人民曾进行了反对美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府奴役统治的伟大英勇斗争。为了抗议美国帝国主义侵略中国，一九四七年一月九日，台湾万余学生曾举行过雄壮的游行示威，高呼“美军撤出中国去”。为了反对美国傀儡国民党的暴政，两年以前台省人民曾进行了“二、二八”运动，掀起了轰轰烈烈的全台湾的武装起义。台湾人民的这种斗争和中国其他各省人民求解放斗争的目标是完全相同的，这就是打倒帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义对于中国人民的奴役统治，建立一个独立的统一的人民民主的新中国，即中国人民共和国。因此，所谓“台湾独立运动”，乃是对于台湾人民的绝端侮辱。
    中国人民（包括台湾人民）将绝对不能容忍美国帝国主义对台湾或任何其他中国领土的非法侵略，同样地亦绝对不能容忍国民党反动派把台湾作为最后挣扎的根据地。中国人民解放斗争的任务就是解放全中国，直到解放台湾、海南岛和属于中国的最后一寸土地为止。由于中国形势已发生巨大变化，中国人民解放斗争的胜利一定要在不久的时间内全部实现。中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要解放全中国。
