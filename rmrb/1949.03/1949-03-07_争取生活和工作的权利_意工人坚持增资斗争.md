Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The Italian working people are continuing their struggle to win the right to live and work. According to TASS: Workers at the Ilva factory in Portoferraio (on Elba Island) are continuing to occupy the enterprise. Workers have also occupied two optical glass factories in Florence. Workers in Bologna held a five-hour general strike to protest the announced closure by the management of an electrical equipment factory. A meeting of 50,000 workers convened by the Bologna Trade Union Committee decided to implement a "chessboard-style" (meaning staggered) protest strike system on March 1st, with all enterprises in the city striking for fifteen minutes each. Workers in Milan stopped work in all enterprises on February 28th in response to provocative actions by the police, who had dispersed a meeting protesting the release of fascist criminals.

According to Electrotelegraphic Agency: The Italian General Confederation of Labor has decided to convene two meetings of Italian trade union and trade union committee secretaries in order to coordinate a national movement for a general wage increase. These two meetings will be held this week in Milan and Naples. The meetings have become even more important after the General Confederation of Labor received a letter from the Italian Manufacturers Association. In that letter, the manufacturers stated that they would "not tolerate non-cooperation movements" as a form of trade union struggle. In their letter to the General Confederation of Labor, the manufacturers also implied criticism of the activities of factory committees. However, there is no doubt that the General Confederation of Labor will shatter the capitalists' attempts to deprive the trade unions of their rights.

　　争取生活和工作的权利
  　意工人坚持增资斗争
    【新华社陕北五日电】意大利劳动人民正继续其争取生活与工作权利的斗争。据塔斯社讯：艾菲里奥港（在厄尔巴岛）伊尔瓦工厂的鼓风炉工人们，正在继续占据这一企业。工人们并占据了佛罗伦萨的两家光学玻璃工厂。波仑亚工人举行了五小时总罢工，抗议一家电气器材工厂资方所宣布的停业。波仑亚工会委员会召集之五万工人大会，决定于三月一日实行“棋盘式”（意即交错进行）的抗议罢工制度，全市一切企业各罢工十五分钟。米兰工人们于二月二十八日在一切企业中停工，以回答警察的挑衅行动，后者曾驱散抗议释放法西斯罪犯的会议。
    又据电通社讯：意大利总工会已决定召集意大利工会和工会委员会书记两次会议，以便调度普遍增加工资的全国运动。这两次会议将于本周内在米兰和那不勒斯两地召开。会议在收到意大利厂主协会致总工会的信以后，更加显得重要。厂主们在该信中称，他们将“不容忍不合作运动”作为工会斗争的形式。厂主们在给总工会的信中，并暗示了厂主对于工厂委员会活动的责难。但是，毫无疑问，总工会将打破资本家剥夺工会权利的企图。
