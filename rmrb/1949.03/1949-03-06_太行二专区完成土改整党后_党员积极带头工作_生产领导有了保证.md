[Taihang Electric] After most villages in the Taihang Second Special District completed land reform and Party rectification, the consciousness of Party members and the masses has been raised. The masses are adding livestock, repairing houses, and actively preparing for this year's production. The district began to conclude land reform and Party rectification in mid-November last year. As of now, 509 villages have successfully completed it, 448 villages are in progress or about to be completed, and the remaining 144 villages have also started early. The entire district is expected to be completed by early March. At present, except for some villages with remaining problems, most of the completed villages have achieved the goal of uniting production and raising the consciousness of Party members and the masses. In accordance with policy principles, the class status was correctly revised, middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against were compensated, landlords were properly settled, and land, housing, and other necessary means of production were allocated to poor peasants who had not yet fully turned themselves over. At the same time, the land and property of 55 households of landlords and rich peasants (missing figures from 60 villages) who still retained surplus feudal property were confiscated and requisitioned in accordance with policy principles. In the work of compensation, resettlement, and allocation of land, the scope of redistribution was generally small. In 41 villages in Xiyang, the redistribution area only accounted for 2% of the total households. In 42 villages in Yushe, it accounted for 4.2%, fully implementing the principle of moving a minority and not a majority, so that all classes obtained certain means of production, and thus the enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. This is reflected in the widespread increase in livestock purchases, house repairs, and production planning. According to statistics from Yushe, Heshun, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, and Zuoquan counties, the masses have organized the purchase of 967 head of livestock. In Yushe county alone, 56 villages increased the purchase of 137 head of oxen, 209 donkeys, and 23 mules. Statistics from six villages in Zuoquan show that a total of 140 new houses were built. Wang Dianjun, a labor hero in Baiyangyu, Xiyang, led the masses in formulating a three-year construction plan to ensure the purchase of 34 head of livestock and the construction and repair of 41 houses. In particular, it has had a direct impact and promotion on the winter production campaign. For example, statistics from 279 villages in Yushe, Heshun, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, and Zuoquan for two months show: 1. A total profit of 7,800,240 yuan in new currency was obtained from the four production items of transportation, handicraft workshops, textile industry, and mountain cutting. More than 3,600 dan of fertilizer were accumulated, and more than 53 million catties of firewood and coal were accumulated (excluding what was burned). 2. Most Party members have improved their consciousness and been transformed. They have not only overcome negative emotions, but also actively worked and developed a preliminary democratic style. For example, Xiangyuan checked the results of Party rectification in 11 villages in the first district, and the branches of 8 villages consulted with the masses on everything, and their work style has greatly changed. Recently, 80 cadres transferred from Xiyang were in good spirits and firm in their will. Shi Yuande and Qiao Chengzheng, Party members in Zhaobi, led the village in transporting 120 head of livestock and engaging in sideline occupations, earning a total profit of more than 100,000 yuan, thus greatly increasing the prestige of the Party. The masses in Heshun reflected: "Party members are indeed different from the past." More than 130 people in 11 villages in the first district of Xiangyuan requested to join the Party. Twenty-three young people in Donghui Village, Yushe, requested to join the Party. Farmers in various villages have become more convinced of the leadership of the Party, laying a favorable foundation for the large-scale production that is about to unfold.

　　太行二专区完成土改整党后
    党员积极带头工作　生产领导有了保证
    【太行电】太行二专区大多数村已完成结束土地改革和整党，党员、群众觉悟提高，群众添置牲畜、修盖房屋，积极准备今年生产。该区结束土地改革与整党工作，从去年十一月中旬开始，截至现在，已有五百零九个村胜利完成，四百四十八个村正在进行或将要结束，剩余一百四十四个村亦已早经开始，全区约于三月初即可全部结束。目前已结束了的村庄除部分村尚有遗留问题外，绝大部分达到了团结生产及提高党员群众觉悟的目的。并根据政策原则，正确的改订成份，补偿了错斗中农，适当安置了地主，并给未翻透身的少地农民，调剂了土地房屋及其他必要的生产资料。同时对五十五户（缺六十个村的数字）尚保有多余封建财产的地主富农，按照政策原则，分别进行没收与征收。在补偿安置调剂土地工作中，一般的抽动面很小。昔阳四十一个村抽动面仅占总户百分之二。榆社四十二村占百分之四点二，完全执行了动少数不动多数的原则，使各阶层都获得了一定的生产资料，因而生产情绪大大提高。表现在各地普遍的增买牲口，兴修房屋，订生产计划。榆社、和顺、襄垣、武乡、左权五个县的统计，仅群众有组织的买牲口，就有九百六十七头，榆社一个县五十六个村，即增买了耕牛一百三十七头，驴二百零九头，骡二十三头。左权六个村的统计，共新修房屋一百四十间。昔阳白阳峪劳动英雄王殿俊领导群众订出今后三年建设计划，保证买牲口三十四头，新修与补修房四十一间。特别是对冬季生产运动起了直接的影响与推动作用。如榆社、和顺、襄垣、武乡、左权二百七十九个村两个月的统计：一、运输、手工业作坊、纺织业、砍山四项生产共获利新币七百八十万零二千四百元。积肥三千六百余担，打柴积煤五千三百余万斤（除烧了的）。二、大部党员觉悟提高，得到改造，不但克服了消极情绪，而且主动积极工作，并有了初步的民主作风。如襄垣检查了一区十一个村的整党结果，八个村的支部凡事和群众商量，作风大有转变。昔阳最近调八十个干部情绪都好，意志坚定。赵壁党员史元德、乔成正，领导全村牲口一百二十头运输、搞副业，共获利十余万元，因而党的威信大大提高。和顺群众反映：“党员确实和过去不同了”。襄垣一区十一个村有一百三十多个群众要求入党。榆社东汇村有二十三个青年要求入党。各村农民都更加相信了党的领导。给即将展开的大生产打下了有利的基础。
