　　Xuanhua—Place name. Located 90 *li* southeast of Zhangjiakou, the capital of Chahar Province. The Ping-Sui Railway passes through here. After the Japanese bandits surrendered in August 1945, Xuanhua was liberated. In July 1946, after the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas, they invaded Xuanhua in October. During the two-year period that the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied the area, they wantonly destroyed, looted, and stole the local industry and the people's property. On December 23, 1948, Xuanhua was liberated again. Under the leadership of the democratic government, Xuanhua is advancing towards becoming a people's production city.
　　Beater—A tool used in the papermaking process. The raw materials used for papermaking mostly contain colloids and other impurities, so they must first be treated with caustic soda or steam to separate the fibers and remove the colloids and impurities. Then, the beater is used to tear the fibers into pure pulp.
　　Copper mesh—After the pure pulp is made, the copper mesh is used to absorb the moisture from the pulp. At the same time, it also determines the style of the paper, such as roll paper or flat paper.
　　Blower and drying cylinder—These two items are used to dry the newly made wet paper in the papermaking process. Blowers are widely used in industry and are not necessarily dedicated to the papermaking industry.
　　Water pump—Pump, pronounced *bèng*. A common name for a water extraction machine.
