　　Female Political Commissar
  　Introduction of National Women's Congress Representative
    Xiao Yu
    Comrade Wu Chaoxiang is one of the eleven representatives from Ping City to attend the National Women's Congress. She is the political commissar of the Supply Department of the 121st Division of the People's Liberation Army's 41st Army.
    Comrade Wu Chaoxiang is thirty-two years old this year. She is tall and sturdy, enthusiastic and sincere, and deeply involved with the masses, fully possessing the characteristics of a political worker. Every comrade who works with her, especially subordinates, deeply loves and respects her.
    She joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at the age of fifteen (winter of 1933), and went through the 25,000-li Long March, eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and more than two years of the People's Liberation War. During the Red Army era, she served as the battalion commander of the district independent battalion and was wounded twice in battle.
    During the 25,000-li Long March, she was the leader of the stretcher company of the Fourth Front Army. On the way, the company she led lost contact with the entire army due to transporting military grain. At that time, the situation was urgent, and the terrain was unfamiliar. Because of her calm and composed approach to finding a way to continue moving forward, she encouraged the women in the company with courage and determination, correctly judged the direction of movement, and after seven days and seven nights, climbed over seven large mountains, reuniting with the army in Ma'erkang.
    During the Ten Years' Civil War, she served as the Minister of Women's Affairs of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, she was also a member of the All-China Women's Federation. She has made great progress under the cultivation of the Party and her own active efforts. In 1945, she went to Northeast China and served as the Director of the Political Department of the Health Department of the Liaodong Military Region. In 1947, she was transferred to be the political commissar of the Supply Department of the 121st Division. Her simple and hard-working lifestyle and enthusiastic and active work attitude educated and moved everyone. In the summer of 1947, during military training at Xiajiabuzi (Qingyuan County, Northeast China), due to continuous heavy rain, the river rose sharply, and the training ground was separated from the other side of the river. In order to ensure continued training, the division leaders called for bridge building. She took the lead in actively responding and, like the odd-job workers, took off her shoes and carried wood barefoot. Some male comrades carried a piece of wood with two people, but she carried one on her own, thereby influencing and promoting everyone's work enthusiasm. This example is actually a microcosm of her entire work situation.

　　女政治委员
  　全国妇大代表介绍
    肖玉
    吴朝祥同志是平市妇女出席全国妇代大会的十一名代表之一，他是人民解放军第四十一军一二一师供给部的政治委员。
    吴朝祥同志，今年三十二岁，身材魁梧，热情诚恳，深入群众，充分具备着政治工作者的特色。每一个和她一起工作的同志，尤其是下级人员，都十分爱戴她。
    她十五岁（一九三三年冬天）参加了中国工农红军，经过了两万五千里的长征、八年抗战和两年多的人民解放战争。红军时代，她担任过区独立营的营长，并在战斗中负了两次伤。
    二万五千里长征当中，她是红四方面军担架连的连长。途中，她领导的这个连曾因运输军粮而和整个部队失掉了联系，当时情况紧急，地理不熟，由于她镇静沉着的想办法继续前进，使这一连女同志鼓舞着勇气和决心，正确地判断了行动方向，经过七天七夜的行程，爬过了七层大山，在马儿康重新和部队会合。
    十年内战时期，她曾担任过川陕省委妇女部长，八年抗日战争中，也曾经为全国妇联的委员之一，她在党的培养和自己的积极努力下，取得了很大的进步。一九四五年她到了东北，任辽东军区卫生部政治处主任，四七年调任一二一师供给部政治委员。她朴素艰苦的生活作风和热情积极的工作态度，教育与感动了大家。一九四七年夏季，于夏家堡子练兵时（东北清原县）因霪雨连绵，河水暴涨，练兵场所被河水隔在对岸。为保证继续练兵，师首长便号召搭桥。她首先积极响应和勤杂人员一样的脱下鞋赤着脚搬运木材，有些男同志才两人抬一块，她却自己扛上一根，因而影响推动了大家的工作热情。这一个例子，实际也就是她全部工作情况的剪影。
