　　To Take Over Work, Follow the Mass Line
  　To Easily Discover Hidden Resources
    Fourthly, to take over work, it is necessary to follow the mass line and closely rely on underground party members and progressive elements. In various taken-over units, underground party members and progressive workers reported a lot of concealed materials and takeover targets, giving great help to the takeover work. For example, when taking over weapons at the Peiping branch of the pseudo-Central Bank, a secret agent failed to report his gun for surrender. After a progressive element reported it, a follow-up investigation was conducted, making it impossible for him to hide it. Fifthly, the method of "fast takeover, slow inventory and handover" was implemented. After a rapid takeover, the original heads of the organs were instructed to handle the handover. This not only overcame the state of anarchy, but also reduced the loss of materials. This time, the takeover work adopted the method of entering the city in batches, avoiding the past problem of rushing in and taking over hastily. However, at the same time, there was a tendency to be too slow, failing to carry out a comprehensive takeover quickly enough to meet objective requirements. Inventory work must be carried out carefully. When the various units taken over by the association carried out inventory work, it was found that the corruption of the pseudo-personnel in some units of the logistics department was extremely serious. It was found that the number of materials handed over by many units did not match the numbers on the registers, and there was a phenomenon of hiding large quantities of materials. For example, the Logistics Department found as many as 42,000 sets of cotton military uniforms and 20,000 overcoats scattered among private merchants. If a careful inventory is not carried out, the materials will be lost. Sixthly, at the same time as the takeover work, attention must be paid to stabilizing people's livelihood. This time, the takeover work prepared sufficient materials in advance, and after entering the city, sold some grain and coal, and quickly carried out preferential exchange of pseudo-gold yuan coupons, so that the majority of workers, students, and citizens suffered less from the devaluation of the pseudo-gold yuan coupons. This stabilized people's hearts and created conditions for a smooth takeover. Seventhly, takeover work should be combined with construction work. For example, after taking over the Shijingshan Steel Plant, the task of restoring production at the plant was immediately put forward, which greatly encouraged all the workers and actively carried out resumption of work. Finally, and most importantly, is to strengthen organizational discipline and strictly implement the system of asking for instructions and reporting. The Materials Management Committee has not made any major mistakes since it began taking over work, mainly because of this. Because of the implementation and adherence to this system, individual tendencies to violate policies and regulations could also be quickly corrected. At the same time, it overcame the tendency of some takeover personnel to obey their superiors in everything without actively thinking of more solutions. This not only strengthened discipline, but also improved the work enthusiasm and initiative of the takeover personnel, which is a successful experience.

　　接管工作要走群众路线
  　才易发现隐藏资材
    第四是接管工作要走群众路线，紧密地依靠地下党员及进步分子。在各接管单位中，地下党员和进步职工都报告了不少的隐匿资材和接管对象，给予接管工作很大的帮助。如接管伪中央银行北平分行收缴武器时，有一特务的枪未报告缴出，经进步分子报告后，即加追查，使其无法隐藏。第五是实行了快接管慢清点交代的方法，迅速接管后，责成原机关负责人办理交代，既可克服无政府状态，也可减少资材的损失。此次接管工作，采取分批入城的办法，避免了过去一拥而入，潦草接管的毛病；但同时发生了一些过于迟缓的偏向，不能迅速进行全面的接管，以适应客观的要求。清点工作必须仔细进行，该会各接管单位进行清点工作时，发现后勤部门有些单位伪人员贪污异常严重，清点出许多单位的交代物资数目与清册上的数目不符，并发现有隐藏大量物资现象。如后勤部查出散存于私商的棉军衣数达四万二千套，大衣二万套。如不仔细清点，物资是会受到损失的。第六，与接管工作同时，必须注意安定民生。此次接管工作，事前准备了充足的物资，待入城后即抛售一部分粮煤，和迅速进行伪金元券优待兑换，使广大工人学生和市民少受伪金元券贬值的损失，人心安定，使接管工作能在很安定的秩序下进行，增加了顺利接管的条件。第七，接管工作要与建设工作联合进行，如接管石景山炼钢厂后，随即提出恢复该厂生产的任务，使全厂职工得到了很大的鼓舞，积极进行复工。最后也是最重要的，是加强组织纪律，严格请示报告制度。物管会开始接管工作以来，未犯大的错误，主要原因即在于此。由于实行和坚持了这一制度，发生个别违反政策纪律的偏向，也能够迅速得到纠正。同时也克服了某些接管人员一切听命上级，而不积极多想办法的偏向。这样既加强了纪律，又提高了接管人员的工作积极性和主动性，是一个成功的经验。　　（朱汉）
