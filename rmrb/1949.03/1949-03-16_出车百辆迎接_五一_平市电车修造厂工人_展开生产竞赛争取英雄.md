A Hundred Trolleys to Greet "May Day"
    Workers at the Ping City Trolley Repair Plant
  　Launch a Production Competition to Strive to be Heroes
    [This Newspaper's Report] Workers at the Beiping Trolley Company Repair Plant recently launched a "May First" Labor Day campaign to produce one hundred trolleys, as a gift to the more than two million citizens of the city to welcome "May Day." Four new-style trolleys currently being painted will be officially put into service on "May Day." The tense repair plant is plastered with slogans such as "Welcome Liberation, Produce One Hundred Trolleys" and "Strive to be Labor Heroes." After preliminary study movements, the production enthusiasm and work efficiency of the workers have generally increased. The electrical team led by Bai Zhizhao has only two apprentice craftsmen, two apprentices, and one helper, but because they have high work enthusiasm and readily available materials, they repaired and produced seven blower coils in one day on the 15th, doubling the production volume during the Kuomintang rule. On the eve of liberation, from December of last year to January of this year, only forty complete vehicles were running in the city per day. In the past month, after the workers' active rush repairs, the number of operating vehicles has increased sharply to eighty. Now the workers have automatically put forward the slogan of producing one hundred trolleys on "May First" Labor Day. On the afternoon of the 15th, the preparatory committee of the repair plant's trade union specially invited the foremen to a meeting to study ways to complete this task. Foreman Guo Qishan said: "I am responsible for supplying parts. I will follow them (referring to other department foremen) wherever they work, and I will never delay the work on my part." Welding foreman Wang Naiquan said: "We want to have a work competition and strive to be labor heroes." Electrical foreman Bai Zhizhao said: "We can no longer hoard parts like before. Whoever hoards them, take them all out!" Lathe foreman Wang Xi said: "Foremen must cooperate closely for work to be fast and good." The foremen are now working hard to rush production, and they will hold meetings at any time to solve difficulties, striving to repair one hundred vehicles by "May Day."

　　出车百辆迎接“五一”
    平市电车修造厂工人
  　展开生产竞赛争取英雄
    【本报讯】北平电车公司修造厂工人，顷发起“五一”劳动节出车百辆运动，作为迎接“五一”，献给全市二百余万市民的礼物。现正在油刷的新式电车四辆，将于“五一”正式开出。紧张的修造厂里贴满了“迎接解放，出车百辆”、“争取劳动英雄”等标语，工人们经过初步学习运动，生产情绪与工作效率普遍增高，由白志钊领班的电工组，只有两个练习工匠，两个学徒和一个小工，但因他们工作情绪高，材料又凑手，在十五日一天就修做出七个吹火圈，比国民党统治时期的生产量提高了一倍。在解放前夕，即去年十二月至本年一月期间，全市一天只有四十辆完整的车辆行驶，最近一个月内，经过工人积极赶修，行驶的车辆骤增至八十辆。现在工人又自动提出了“五一”劳动节出车百辆的口号。十五日下午，修造厂的职工会筹委会特邀集各领班开会，研究完成这一任务的办法。案工领班郭岐山说：“我负责供给零件，他们（指别的部门领班）做到那儿我跟到那儿，绝不能把工作耽误在我身上。”烧焊领班王乃全说：“我们要工作竞赛，争取当劳动英雄。”电工领班白志钊说：“不能再象以前那样囤积零件，谁有囤积，全拿出来！”旋工领班王希说：“各领班要紧密合作，工作才能快、好。”现各领班负责正努力加工赶作，有困难随时开会解决，争取于“五一”修成一百辆车。
