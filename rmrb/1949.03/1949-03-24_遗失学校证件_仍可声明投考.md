　　Lost School Documents
    Still Eligible to Apply

    Mr. Ma Shichang:
    According to the enrollment guidelines of the Revolutionary University, any student with a letter of explanation or proof document from their school or student union can register. You should obtain this from your school. If you have lost contact with your school and do not have a letter of introduction from an organization or a people's government above the district level, in this case, according to the responsible comrade of China University: since you have the enthusiasm to participate in the revolution, you can go to the China University Revolutionary University Admissions Office, explain the situation, and then register to take the exam.

    Mr. Xinye: The answers to your questions are as follows:
    If you are admitted to the three major universities (North China University, Military and Political University, Revolutionary University) or the Southbound Work Group, the tuition fees paid at the original school should be refunded, but certain procedures are required. Regarding the situation of the two students from Zhicheng Middle School you mentioned, they can obtain a certificate from the school they are applying to, and then have it approved by the original school's school affairs meeting before the fees can be refunded.

　　遗失学校证件
    仍可声明投考马世昌先生：
    按革命大学招生简章规定：凡学生持有学校或学生会的说明信，或证明文件便可报名。你应向贵校索取，假如你已和校方失掉联系，又没有机关团体及区以上人民政府的介绍信，这种情形，据华大负责同志谈：你既然有参加革命的热情，可到中国大学革大招生办事处，说明情况，便可报名参加考试。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　社会服务组
    新野先生：所提问题解答如下：
    考上三大学（华北大学、军政大学、革命大学）或南下工作团，在原校所交学费应该退还，但须经过一定手续：如你所谈志成中学两位同学的情况，可持该投考学校的证明信，再经其原校校务会议通过后，方可退回。
