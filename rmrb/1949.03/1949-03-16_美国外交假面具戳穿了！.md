American Diplomatic Mask Pierced! (Continued)
    Espionage Activities of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union
    Booker writes: Even ordinary embassy employees are forced to engage in espionage activities. When they travel in the Soviet Union for this or that purpose, they must make detailed reports of everything they hear and see along the way, and of their interactions with the Soviet people. Booker describes in detail how the embassy counselor, former U.S. Navy Major Luke, traveled to Vladivostok on the orders of some of the embassy's top officials. It was said that he was there for diplomatic business, but in fact, he was collecting intelligence beneficial to the American intelligence agencies.
    Booker points out: Recently, the embassy's third secretary, Villiers, made a similar trip, visiting the Urals, the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
    Booker writes: One of the avenues for espionage activities by the U.S. Embassy is to exploit those who come to the embassy for this or that personal purpose. The book points out: The espionage work of the U.S. Embassy is carried out strictly according to a carefully thought-out espionage system.
    Booker emphasizes: Smith found that many of the espionage activities of the U.S. Embassy during the term of his predecessor, Harriman (who was only a temporary and not a professional spy), were "childish" and "superficial" and had to be thoroughly reformed. The author points out: These reforms carried out under Smith's leadership are particularly characterized by the fact that Smith actually forced every embassy employee, down to the lowest clerk, to engage in espionage activities.
    In her book, Booker lists facts to illustrate how the U.S. Embassy used American correspondents in the Soviet Union for espionage activities. Booker particularly describes the American journalist Robert Magidoff, who was expelled from the Soviet Union for engaging in espionage activities. (Note: He was expelled from the Soviet Union in April 1948).
    The facts pointed out by Booker are undeniable. She wrote down the names of American spies, exposed their methods of work, revealed the sources of some of the slanderous information obtained by American newspapers for unlimited anti-Soviet propaganda, and explained the truth about the leaders of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, who used the disguise of diplomatic activities to conceal their espionage work.
    "Voice of America" and "Amerika"
    In her book, Booker also discusses the situation of the American news and propaganda agencies, reveals the methods of American anti-Soviet propaganda, explains what purposes this propaganda pursues, and who writes the anti-Soviet propaganda texts of the United States. There are two avenues for American propaganda against the Soviet Union: first, broadcasting programs in Russian from the United States under the name of "Voice of America." Second, publishing the Russian magazine "Amerika" in the Soviet Union. Booker writes: "Voice of America" not only hires White Russian bandits as broadcasters but also actively uses them as experts on Russian issues and consultants for radio programs. Booker says: Not only does "Voice of America" use White Russian bandits, but also the heads of the State Department use White Russian bandits for work. Booker describes a man named Barnes to prove the fact that the State Department uses White Russian bandits. She herself had known this Barnes for a long time. Barnes was actually the representative of the White Russian bandits in the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union. Barnes' mother, the former Countess Tolstoy, resided together near a farm in New York (Note: This farm is an anti-Soviet stronghold for White Russian bandits who fled to the United States). Barnes himself was also a close friend of Tolstoy, and the two collaborated on anti-Soviet instigation activities. Booker points out: The anti-Soviet ruling clique in the State Department places great hopes on the broadcasts of "Voice of America." This clique fantasizes that "Voice of America" will become a "lullaby" for millions of Soviet families. Booker writes: However, the hosts of "Voice of America" have forgotten that the Soviet radio audience is completely different from the American audience. "Voice of America" is not at all popular in the Soviet Union, and virtually no one listens to it. When Booker speaks of "Amerika" magazine, she points out: It cannot deceive Soviet readers, nor does it suit their tastes. Soviet people do not want to be shamelessly fooled.
    U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith Takes the Lead in Speculation
    Booker not only reveals the true colors of the personnel of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in engaging in espionage and news propaganda activities, but also reveals their cunning conspiracies, using countless facts to prove that every employee of the U.S. Embassy is actually engaged in speculative activities of varying degrees, or illegally imports foreign currency under the cover of diplomatic privileges, or carries duty-free whiskey, cigarettes, and other goods to the Soviet Union for sale, obtaining high profits. Booker writes: Ambassador Smith himself is happy to participate in such dirty speculation. The director of the U.S. Embassy Supply Office, Bender (who carries out the ambassador's instructions), told the author: Smith gave him sets of clothes, fountain pens, and cigarettes to sell on the market. They did not sell well on the market, but the "master" forced him to get the money.
    Why does Booker want to stay in the Soviet Union?
    The last chapter of the book is devoted to the author's impressions of the Soviet Union. The author writes: I see that ordinary Soviet citizens know more about the United States than Americans know about the Soviet Union. Ordinary Soviet citizens' understanding of American life issues is not as inappropriate as Americans' understanding of their own domestic lives. I have become convinced that Soviet newspapers do not engage in any propaganda aimed at inciting hatred of the American people. At the same time, the entire strength of American newspapers and radio broadcasts is directly against the Soviet people.
    Booker says: Soviet citizens have high respect and trust in their government, the Bolshevik Party, and their leaders. Soviet citizens are ardent patriots, and the Soviet people believe that their country is just, and the Soviet Union is indeed just. Booker's impression is obtained by carefully studying the reality of the Soviet Union. She has traveled to many cities and villages in the Soviet Union, especially Ukraine.
    Booker writes: Although I am a 100% American, I have always loved my country and have served it selflessly, yet I have decided to stay in the Soviet Union forever. I only had a rather vague understanding of this country in the past, but now, after only living here for two years, I have come to understand it and love it very much. I made this decision because I am convinced that the current ruling clique in the United States is leading the United States, and the whole world with it, towards a terrible disaster.
    American propaganda organs will undoubtedly try to make people disbelieve the book written by Booker. Some people are already doing this. However, no one can refute the facts written in this book, and in any case, they cannot weaken the iron logic of these facts.

### 美国外交假面具戳穿了！

　　美国外交假面具戳穿了！（续完）
    美驻苏大使馆的特务活动
    布克尔写道：就连大使馆普通的职员，都被迫从事谍报活动。当他们为了这个或那个目的在苏联旅行时，必须把他们在途中耳闻目见的每一件事务，和苏联人民来往情形作详细的报告。布克尔详细描述大使馆参赞、前美国海军少校、特务路克奉大使馆一些首脑人员的命令旅行海参崴的情形。据说他是为了外交公务，但事实上却是搜集有利于美国谍报机关的情报。
    布克尔指出：最近大使馆三等秘书佛里尔斯曾作同样性质的旅行，访问乌拉尔、高加索、中亚细亚。
    布克尔写道：美国大使馆特务活动的途径之一，便是利用那些为这种或那些私人目的来到该使馆的人们。该书指出：美国大使馆的谍报工作，是严格的按照经过深思熟虑所想出的特务系统的线路去进行的。
    布克尔强调称：史密斯发现现在他的前任哈里曼（他仅是临时的而不是职业的特务）任期内，美国大使馆的许多谍报活动都是“幼稚”、“浅薄”的，必须加以彻底改革。该书作者指出：在史密斯领导之下所进行的这些改革，其特点特别可以从下面的事实表示出来，史密斯实际上强迫每一个大使馆的职员，直到最低的小职员，都从事间谍活动。
    布克尔在她的著作中列举事实，说明美国大使馆利用美国驻苏记者，进行间谍活动的情形。布克尔特别描述因从事间谍活动被苏联驱逐出境的美国记者罗伯特·马基多夫。（按：他于一九四八年四月被逐出苏联）。
    布克尔指出的事实，都是无可争辩的。她写出了美国特务的姓名，揭露了他们的工作方法，揭露了美国报纸为了进行无限制的反苏宣传而取得一些诽谤资料的来源，并说明了美国驻苏大使馆领导人员的真相，他们以外交活动的伪装，来掩盖他们的特务工作。
    “美国呼声”与“美国人”
    布克尔在她的这本书中，又论述了美国新闻与宣传机关的情形，揭露了美国反苏宣传的方法，说明了这个宣传奉行着怎样的目的，以及美国的反苏宣传文字是由谁执笔的。美国的对苏宣传有两条途径：第一，以“美国呼声”的名义，从美国用俄语播送节目。第二，在苏联出版俄文杂志“美国人”。布克尔写道：“美国呼声”不仅聘请白党匪徒当广播员，并且积极地利用他们充当俄罗斯问题专家和无线电广播节目的顾问，布克尔说：不仅“美国呼声”利用白党匪徒，而且国务院首脑们也利用白党匪徒工作。布克尔描述一个名叫巴尼斯的人，以证明国务院利用白党匪徒的事实，她本人很久以前，就认识这个巴尼斯。巴尼斯实际上是白党匪徒在美国驻苏大使馆的代表。巴尼斯的母亲前伯爵夫人托尔斯塔亚一同驻在纽约附近的一个农庄（按：这个农庄是逃亡美国的白党匪徒的一个反苏据点）。巴尼斯自己也是托尔斯塔亚的密友，他们两人在反苏挑拨活动上合作。布克尔指出：国务院的反苏统治集团对“美国呼声”的广播寄以巨大的希望。这一集团幻想“美国呼声”会变成苏联千千万万家庭的“催眠曲”。布克尔写道：然而，“美国呼声”的主持人，忘记了苏联的无线电广播听众与美国的听众完全不同。“美国呼声”在苏联丝毫不受欢迎，而且实际上没有一个人收听它。布克尔说到“美国人”杂志时指出：它欺骗不了苏联读者，而且也不合他们的口味，苏联人不愿被人无耻地愚弄。
    美驻苏大使史密斯带头进行投机买卖
    布克尔不仅揭露了美国驻莫斯科大使馆人员从事谍报与新闻宣传活动的本色，并且又揭露了他们的诡谲的阴谋活动，他们用了无数的事实证明美国大使馆的每一个职员，实际上都做事或大或小的投机活动，或在外交官特权的掩护下，非法输入外币以免税携带威士忌酒、香烟等商品到苏联出售，获得高利。布克尔写道：史密斯大使自己也是高兴参加这种卑污的投机的。美国大使馆供给处主任班德（他执行大使的指示）对作者说过：史密斯交给他到市场出卖的成套衣服，自来水笔与香烟，在市场上没有销路，卖不出去，但是“主子”逼着他要钱。
    布克尔为什么要留居苏联？
    该书的最后一章，专述作者对苏联的印象。该书作者写道：我看到苏联普通公民对美国的了解，比美国人对苏联的了解为多。苏联普通公民对美国生活问题的了解，还不象美国人对自己国内生活的了解那样不恰当。我已经确实认识到：苏联报纸并没有从事任何要激起仇恨美国人民的宣传。而在同时，美国报纸与无线电广播的全部力量，却是直接反对苏联人民的。
    布克尔说：苏联公民高度尊重与信任他们的政府、布尔什维克党和他们的领袖们。苏联公民是热烈爱国的，苏联人民认为他们的国家是正义的，而苏联也的确是正义的。布克尔这种印象，是由细密地研究苏联的现实所得到的。她曾旅行过苏联许多城市和乡村，特别是旅行了乌克兰。
    布克尔写道：我虽然是百分之百的美国人，一贯爱我的国家，并曾无我地为它服务，然而，我却决定永远留在苏联。对于这个国家，我过去只有颇为模糊的认识，但是，现在虽仅住了两年，我已经了解它，并且很爱它了。我所以要作这个决定，是因为我已经确信：美国当前的统治集团，正在把美国、并且还把全世界同它一起导向可怕的大灾难。
    美国的宣传机关，无疑地将企图使人不相信布克尔所著的书。已经有人在这样作了。然而却没有任何人能反驳这本书里面所写的事实，而且，无论如何都不能削弱这些事实的铁的逻辑。
