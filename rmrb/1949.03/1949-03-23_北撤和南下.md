　　Northward Withdrawal and Southward Advance
    (Yang Chao, Fifth Company, Seventh Brigade, Jiangxi Military Region)
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, for the sake of peace, Chairman Mao personally went to Chongqing to conclude the Double Tenth Agreement. Our New Fourth Army troops in Jiangnan also complied with the agreement and withdrew north to Jiangbei.

    One afternoon in autumn, we gathered on the beach of Hangzhou Bay, where many sailboats were moored on the sea. The队伍 was listening quietly to the political commissar's speech: "...We fought the Japanese devils here and established anti-Japanese base areas... But for the sake of national peace, we are ordered to withdraw north... We believe we will definitely return. We must tell the elders and folks of Jiangnan that we will not let them down..."

    Only the seawater was lapping against the shore, and everyone was bowing their heads in contemplation, thinking about the places where they had lived and fought, and remembering that they had shed blood and sweat here. In order to liberate the people from enslavement, some of our comrades had already shed their blood on this free land. But today we have to leave it, leave our hometown compatriots who are as close as flesh and blood. How sad and painful everyone's mood is!

    On the march, the common people knew that we were withdrawing north, so they came up to surround us, grabbed our hands, and asked us with uneasy and accusatory eyes: "When will you come back?" "What will happen to us after you leave?" Workers and students from Shanghai specially brought gifts to the suburbs to慰劳 us, and described how the citizens of Shanghai were preparing to welcome the New Fourth Army, which had been fighting around Greater Shanghai for several years. What impressed me the most was that once, when we were cooking in a small village, an old lady, while preparing some dishes to treat us, said angrily: "Our lives had just gotten better since you New Fourth Army came, but now you are abandoning us again!"

    In fact, the soldiers were also in pain. We knew how much the people needed us to protect them, and we also knew what kind of disaster this once happy base area would suffer after our withdrawal. But in order to carry out the orders of our superiors, and for the greater interests of the people, we crossed Hangzhou Bay, the Huangpu River, and the Yangtze River without hesitation, with heavy hearts. We shattered the enemy's conspiracies of blockade, obstruction, and pursuit, and safely reached the Jiangbei Liberated Area.

    In Shandong, we received some letters from our hometowns. Just as we had previously estimated, the Kuomintang bandit gangs tore up the solemn agreement they had signed with their own hands, and carried out cruel "cleansing campaigns" in the Kuaiji Mountains, Siming Mountains, and Songhu areas time and time again. The militia organized during the Anti-Japanese War to defend their hometowns, and the demobilized soldiers who were maimed and disabled while fighting the Japanese devils, were all subjected to the most brutal persecution, and large numbers of them were massacred. The families of soldiers also suffered the same insane retaliation. Hardworking compatriots groaned under tyranny, with conscription, grain requisitioning, and exorbitant taxes endlessly squeezing and extorting them, leaving the vast Jiangnan elders and folks gasping for breath and struggling on the line of death.

    The letters from our hometowns, every word and every sentence, brought the angry accusations of the elders and folks of our hometowns, and their earnest exhortations and expectations for their sons and brothers. It encouraged and educated every soldier, making them know how they should work and fight.

    For the past three years, we have been fighting on the battlefields of the People's Liberation War. Today, we are victoriously preparing to go south again, to fight back to Jiangnan and rescue the people from their suffering. We are constantly thinking about how excited the compatriots of Jiangnan will be when they see us again! And what will make them even happier is that their sons and soldiers are a hundred times stronger today. In just a few years, we have changed from rudimentary equipment to fully equipped with "American weaponry." Today, we not only have cannons and tanks, but we can also truly use and master them.

    When we participated in the entry ceremony into Beiping and were warmly welcomed by the masses, we couldn't help but be moved by the beautiful memories of the past. In the bamboo forests of Jiangnan, we often barefooted, with our rifles on our shoulders, chatting about when our troops could march majestically on Nanjing Road in Shanghai? But today, thanks to Chairman Mao's correct leadership, the day of national liberation is not far away, and the beautiful goal of the past will become a reality! At the same time, we believe that we will soon receive an even grander and more enthusiastic welcome from the citizens of Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou...: "Our sons and soldiers are back!"

### 北撤和南下

　　北撤和南下
    （江西部七大队五连杨朝）
    抗战胜利后，为了和平，毛主席亲自到重庆去订立了双十协定。我们在江南的新四军部队也遵守协定北撤到江北来了。
    秋天里的一个下午，我们集合在杭州湾的沙滩上，海面上停泊着不少的帆船。队伍静悄悄地在听着政委的讲话：“……我们在这里打过鬼子，建立了抗日根据地……但为了全国的和平，我们奉命北撤了……我们相信我们一定会回来的。我们要告诉江南父老们，不会辜负他们的期望。……”
    只有海水在拍岸作响，每个人都在低头沉思，想着自己曾经生活和战斗过的地方，想起自己在这里曾流过血，流过汗。为了将人民从奴役中解放出来，我们的一些战友们已经把他们的鲜血流在这一块自由的土地上了。而今天我们却要离开它，离开我们曾经血肉相依的故乡同胞们，大家的心情是多么的难受和痛苦呵！
    行军路上，老百姓知道我们要北撤，都上来围着我们，拉住我们的手，带着不安与责备的眼光询问着我们：“你们什么时候再回来呢？”“你们走了以后我们怎么办呢？”上海的工人和学生特地带了慰劳品到市郊来慰劳我们，叙述了上海市市民们是怎样的在准备迎接着几年来奋战在大上海周围的新四军。使我印象最深的是有一次在一个小村里做饭，一位老太太，一面做了些菜想款待我们，一面却生气似的说：“你们新四军来了，我们的日子刚过好些，现在你们又把我们丢下来了！”
    其实，战士们的心情也是痛苦的，我们知道老百姓是怎样的需要保卫他们，也知道当自己撤退了以后，这个曾经是幸福过的根据地将会受到如何的灾难。但是为了执行上级的命令，为了更远大的人民利益，我们怀着沉痛的心情毫不犹豫的跨过了杭州湾、黄浦江和长江。粉碎了敌人封锁、阻拦、追击的阴谋，安全的到达了江北解放区。
    在山东时，我们收到了一些从家乡寄来的信，正象我们以前所估计的一样，国民党匪帮，他们却撕毁了他们亲手签订的庄严协定，在会稽山、四明山和淞沪地区一次又一次的进行了残酷的“清乡”。抗战时为了保卫家乡而组织起来的民兵，为了打鬼子而流血残废的复员军人，都受到了最残酷的迫害，大批的被屠杀了。而一些军属们也同样的受到了疯狂的报复。辛勤的同胞们则呻吟在暴政下，抽丁、征粮、苛捐杂税，无止境地敲榨和勒索，使广大的江南父老奄奄一息，挣扎在死亡线上。
    从家乡来的信件，每一个字每一句话，都带来了家乡父老们愤怒的控诉，和对于子弟们殷切的嘱咐与期望。它鼓励和教育了每一个战士，使他们知道自己应该怎样去工作和战斗。
    三年来，我们转战在人民解放战争的战场上。今天，我们胜利的准备南下了，准备再打回到江南，拯救人民于水深火热之中。我们时时在想念着，当江南的同胞们重见我们时，将会是如何的兴奋呵！而使他们更高兴的则是他们的子弟兵今天已百倍的强大了。只是几年的功夫，我们已从简陋的装备而换成全副“美械”了。我们今天不但有了大炮和坦克，而且已能确实的运用和掌握它们了。
    当我们参加北平入城式而受到群众热情的欢迎时，不禁使我们内心里感动得浮起了以往美满的回忆。以前，在江南的竹林里，我们常常赤着脚，把步枪靠在肩上，闲谈着啥时我们的队伍能雄壮地行进在上海的南京路上呢？但今天，由于毛主席正确的领导，全国解放的日子已经为期不远了，往日美满的目的，也将成为现实了！同时相信，我们将会很快的受到上海、南京、武汉和广州……市民的更盛大与热情的欢迎：“我们的子弟兵回来了！”
