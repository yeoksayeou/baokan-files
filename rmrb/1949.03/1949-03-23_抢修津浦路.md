　　Repairing the Jinpu Railway
    I. Starting Construction
    To repair the Jinpu Railway to support the People's Liberation Army, a certain detachment of the Railway Corps accepted the task of repairing the section from Chenguantun to Dongguang County. All Party members and soldiers loudly proclaimed: "Repair it to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" "One day sooner the line is open, one day sooner we have victory!" "Let the train quickly drive to Nanjing and smash Chiang Kai-shek's head with a wrench!"... The entire detachment started working under this tense spirit.
    The north wind blew up dust, and the soldiers were repairing in the dust, eating in the dust. Their eyes were reddened by the sand, and sand and dirt were scraped into their rice and vegetables, but no one succumbed to these difficulties. Everyone was tensely repairing this Jinpu Railway that leads directly to Nanjing. Lifting rails, laying sleepers, driving spikes, installing fishplates, erecting telegraph poles... Along the ten-odd li of road, a surging, roaring labor battlefield was laid out, showing unparalleled enthusiasm and tension.
    II. Eight Kilometers per Day
    Cadres, engineers, and technicians all went to the site. Cadres below the level of squad leader and foreman were with the soldiers day and night, rushing to complete the repairs. To complete this common task, they were unwilling to rest for even a moment. Even the liberated soldiers were moved to say, "Before, we always tried to avoid work, but now if we don't work hard, we feel bad."
    The communications team was digging telegraph pole holes outside the pass. One person could dig at most three holes a day. Recently, it has developed to a maximum of nine holes per person per day, averaging six holes per person per day—a record unprecedented under enemy rule.
    The Second Company of the First Battalion of the Second Line could put two fishplate bolts on in a fastest time of twenty seconds. Comrade Zai Yuan could remove and install them in just forty seconds. The sixty men of the company could install two bolts on each fishplate, completing one kilometer of steel rail in twenty-five minutes.
    Using a thirty-pound hammer to drive spikes, they could drive an average of 1,400 meters per hour. Driving one spike took an average of about forty-five seconds. Not only was the spiking fast, but the quality was also greatly improved compared to the past. Out of one hundred spikes, no more than fifteen were unqualified.
    Everyone set a goal: "Strive to complete eight kilometers per day!"
    III. Repairing While Studying
    The soldiers did not forget to study while working. Comrade Cui Chengfeng, a soldier in the Fifth Squad of the First Company of the First Battalion, wrote a letter of determination at the beginning of the Jinpu Railway repair:
    "We must not be satisfied, but continue to work hard, not only to be able to carry sleepers and install bolts... but also to improve ourselves politically!"
    This letter of determination represented everyone's will. The entire company decided to strengthen on-site work—do it quickly and well. At the same time, in the process of labor, they would not relax cultural learning and political study; strive to create a model company.
    Whenever there was a break on the site, the instructor would be busy giving lectures, and the cultural teachers and study group leaders would be busy reading newspapers, teaching songs, and teaching literacy. In their studies, they continued to work hard to eliminate illiteracy, and even those who knew the fewest characters learned thirty-five.

### 抢修津浦路

　　抢修津浦路
    一、开工
    抢修津浦路支持解放军，铁纵某支队接受了从陈官屯至东光县的抢修任务之后，全体党员们、战士们响亮的提出：“修到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”“早通车一天，早胜利一天！”“火车赶快开到南京去，用螺丝敲碎蒋介石的脑袋！”……全支队在这种紧张精神下工作起来了。
    北风吹卷着尘土，战士们在风尘里抢修，在风尘里吃饭，眼被风沙迷红，饭里菜里也刮上了沙土，但没有人在这种困难下屈服，大家在紧张地抢修着这条直达南京的津浦铁路。抬铁轨、铺道木、打道钉、上夹板、架电杆……十几里路当中，摆出了一条奔腾叫啸的劳动战场，表现了无比的热烈，紧张。
    二、每日八公里
    干部、工程师、技术人员都到现场去，中队长、监工以下的干部，白天黑夜都和战士们在一起赶修。为了完成这个共同的任务，他们不愿意多休息一会儿。连解放战士们也感动的说：“以前是生法儿躲，现在不好好干，心里就觉着过不去。”
    通信队在关外挖电杆坑子，一个人一天最多挖三个，最近发展到每人每日最多的挖九个，平均每人每日六个——这是在敌人统治下通信工人所未有的纪录。
    二四线大一中队二连，上两个夹板螺线最快者二十秒钟，再元同志连拆带装才四十秒，一连六十人上夹板螺丝，每付夹板上两个，一公里钢轨二十五分钟上完。
    打道钉三十盘锤，每小时平均能打一公里四百米，打一根道钉平均只需时四十五秒左右，打钉不但快，质量也比从前大大提高了，一百个道钉之中，不合格的，不过十五个。
    大家确定了一个目标：每日“为完成八公里而奋斗！”
    三、抢修不忘学习
    战士们在工作中不忘学习，一中队一连五班战士崔成峰同志，在一开始抢修津浦路时，就写下了决心书：
    “我们不要满足，要继续努力，不只要会扛道木上螺丝……还要从政治上提高自己！”
    这对决心书代表了大家的意志。全中队决定要加强现场工作——做的快做的好，同时，要在劳动过程中，不放松文化学习与政治学习；为创造模范连而奋斗。
    在现场上一有休息的时候，指导员就忙着讲课，文化教员、学习组长就忙着读报、教唱歌、教识字，在学习中他们继续努力消灭文盲，学字最少的也学了三十五个字。
