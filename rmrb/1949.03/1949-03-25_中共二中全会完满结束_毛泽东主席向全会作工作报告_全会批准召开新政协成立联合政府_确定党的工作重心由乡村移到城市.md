　　The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concludes Successfully
   Chairman Mao Zedong Delivers a Work Report to the Plenary Session
   The Plenary Session Approves the Convening of a New Political Consultative Conference and the Establishment of a United Government
   Determines the Party's Focus of Work to Shift from Rural Areas to Cities
    The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held near Shijiazhuang. The meeting lasted for eight days and has now come to a successful conclusion. Thirty-four Central Committee members and nineteen alternate Central Committee members attended the plenary session. Twenty Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members were absent. Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a work report to the plenary session. The plenary session approved the work of the Central Political Bureau since the First Plenary Session in June 1945, and considered the leadership of the Central Committee to be correct. The plenary session approved the proposal initiated by the Communist Party of China, in coordination with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages, to convene a new political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries and to establish a democratic coalition government. The plenary session also approved Chairman Mao Zedong's statement of January 14, 1949, and the eight conditions he put forward as the basis for holding peace talks with the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and any other Kuomintang local governments and military groups.
    The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC focused on discussing the issue of shifting the focus of the Party's work from rural areas to cities under the current situation. The plenary session pointed out that from the failure of the Chinese revolution in 1927 to the present, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, the focus of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle has been in the countryside, gathering strength in the countryside, encircling the cities from the countryside, and then seizing the cities. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party united the broad masses of working people and implemented this policy of encircling the cities from the countryside; history has proven that this policy is completely necessary, completely correct, and completely successful. However, the period of adopting such a working method has now come to an end. From now on, a period of going from cities to the countryside and of cities leading the countryside has begun anew. There is no doubt that both urban and rural areas must be taken into consideration, and that cities and the countryside, workers and peasants, industry and agriculture must be closely linked. It is completely wrong to abandon the countryside and only care about the cities if that is the thinking. But the focus of the Party's work must be placed in the cities. The plenary session pointed out that our Party must make great efforts to learn how to lead the people of the cities in carrying out victorious struggles, and learn how to manage and build cities. In leading the struggle of the urban people, the Party must rely on the working class, unite with other working masses, win over intellectuals, and strive to get as many petty bourgeoisie, liberal bourgeoisie, and their representatives as possible who can cooperate with the Communist Party to stand on the same front, in order to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialists, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and to defeat these enemies step by step. The plenary session believes that the central key to managing and building cities is to restore and develop industrial production, first the production of state-owned enterprises, second the production of private enterprises, and third the production of handicrafts. Other work in the city, such as the Party's organizational work, the construction of government organs, the work of trade unions and various mass organizations, public security work, cultural and educational work, etc., should all serve the central task of restoring and developing industrial production. The plenary session called on all comrades in the Party to devote all their efforts to learning the technology and management methods of industrial production, and to learn commercial work, banking work and other work that is closely related to production. It also issued a warning, saying that if our Party is ignorant of production work, cannot quickly learn production work, cannot restore and develop production undertakings as quickly as possible, and obtain definite results, first to improve the lives of workers, and to improve the lives of the general public, then the Party and the people will not be able to maintain power, will not be able to stand firm, and will fail.
    The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC pointed out that the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance requires the Communist Party of China to earnestly unite the entire working class, the entire peasantry, and the broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals as the leading force and foundation of this dictatorship; at the same time, it also requires the Communist Party of China to unite as many representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and the liberal bourgeoisie as possible who can cooperate with the Communist Party, their intellectuals and political factions, in order to jointly overthrow the domestic counter-revolutionary forces and imperialist forces, rapidly restore and develop production, thereby creating conditions to enable China to steadily transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a New Democratic country to a socialist country. The Second Plenary Session called on the entire Party to establish a policy of long-term cooperation with non-Party democrats in ideology and work. On this issue, it is necessary to oppose both the unprincipled attitude of appeasement and the closed-doorism or perfunctory attitude that hinders the unity between the Party and non-Party democrats.
    In view of the imminent nationwide victory of the Chinese revolution with great international significance, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC especially warned all Party comrades not to be arrogant and complacent, and not to be softened by people's unprincipled flattery. The plenary session pointed out that the Chinese revolution is great, but seizing the victory of the national revolution is only the first step in the work. The road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous. The plenary session called on all Party comrades to continue to maintain the style of humility, prudence, no arrogance, no rashness, and hard struggle, so that after overthrowing the counter-revolutionary forces, they can use greater efforts to build a new China. The plenary session believes that although China's economic heritage is backward, the Chinese people are brave and hardworking, the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution and the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic, the leadership of the Communist Party of China, plus the assistance of the powerful worldwide anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union, the speed of China's economic construction will not be slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be successfully achieved in the foreseeable future. There is no basis for pessimistic views on China's economic recovery.

　　中共二中全会完满结束
   毛泽东主席向全会作工作报告
   全会批准召开新政协成立联合政府
   确定党的工作重心由乡村移到城市
    中国共产党第七届第二次中央委员会全体会议，在石家庄附近举行，会议经过八天，业已完满结束。全会到中央委员三十四人，候补中央委员十九人。中央委员及候补中央委员缺席者二十人。毛泽东主席向全会作了工作报告。全会批准了一九四五年六月一中全会以来中央政治局的工作，认为中央的领导是正确的。全会批准了由中国共产党发起，并协同各民主党派、人民团体及民主人士，召开没有反动分子参加的新的政治协商会议及成立民主联合政府的建议。全会并批准一九四九年一月十四日毛泽东主席的声明及其所提八项条件以为与南京国民党反动政府及其他任何国民党地方政府与军事集团举行和平谈判的基础。
    中共七届二中全会着重地讨论了在现在形势下党的工作重心由乡村移到城市的问题。全会指出：从一九二七年中国大革命失败到现在，由于敌我力量的悬殊，中国人民革命斗争的重点是在乡村，在乡村聚集力量，用乡村包围城市，然后夺取城市。党在毛泽东同志的领导下团结了广大的劳动人民，执行了这个用乡村包围城市的方针；历史已经证明这个方针是完全必要，完全正确，并且是完全成功的。但是，采取这样一种工作方式的时期现在已经完结。从现在起，从新开始了由城市到乡村，由城市领导乡村的时期。毫无疑问，城乡必须兼顾，必须使城市和乡村、工人和农民、工业和农业密切地联结起来。决不可以丢掉乡村，仅顾城市，如果这样想，那是完全错误的。但是党的工作重心必须放在城市。全会指出：我党必须用极大的努力去学会领导城市人民进行胜利的斗争，学会管理城市和建设城市。在领导城市人民的斗争时，党必须依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的能够和共产党合作的小资产阶级、自由资产阶级及其代表人物站在一条战线上，以便向帝国主义者、国民党反动派和官僚资产阶级作坚决的斗争，一步一步地去战胜这些敌人。全会认为：管理和建设城市的中心关键是恢复和发展工业生产，第一是公营企业的生产，第二是私营企业的生产，第三是手工业生产。城市中的其他工作，例如党的组织工作，政权机关的建设工作，工会工作和各种民众团体的工作，治安工作，文化教育工作等，都应当为恢复和发展工业生产这一个中心工作而服务。全会号召全党同志用全力学习工业生产的技术和管理方法，学习和生产有密切联系的商业工作、银行工作和其他工作。并且发出警告说：如果我党在生产工作上无知，不能很快地学会生产工作，不能使生产事业尽可能迅速地恢复和发展，获得确实的成绩，首先使工人生活有所改善，并使一般人民的生活有所改善，那么，党和人民就将不能维持政权，就会站不住脚，就会要失败。
    中共七届二中全会指出：无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，要求中国共产党认真地团结全体工人阶级，全体农民阶级和广大的革命知识分子，作为这个专政的领导力量和基础力量；同时，也要求中国共产党团结尽可能多的能够与共产党合作的小资产阶级和自由资产阶级的代表人物，它们的知识分子和政治派别，以便共同打倒国内的反革命势力和帝国主义势力，迅速地恢复和发展生产，从而创造条件使中国有可能稳步地由农业国转变为工业国，由新民主主义国家转变为社会主义国家。二中全会号召全党在思想上和工作上确立与党外民主人士长期合作的政策。在这个问题上，既要反对无原则的迁就主义的态度，又要反对妨碍党与党外民主人士团结的关门主义或敷衍主义的态度。
    鉴于具有伟大国际意义的中国革命的全国胜利，不久就要到来，中共七届二中全会特别警戒全党同志不要骄傲自满，不要被人们的无原则的捧场所软化。全会指出：中国的革命是伟大的，但是夺取全国革命的胜利只是工作的第一步，革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。全会号召全党同志继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁和艰苦奋斗的作风，以便在打倒反革命势力之后，用更大的努力来建设一个新中国。全会认为：中国的经济遗产虽然是落后的，但是中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，中国人民民主革命的胜利和人民民主共和国的建立，中国共产党的领导权，加上以苏联为首的强大的全世界反帝国主义阵线的援助，中国经济建设的速度，将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日成功的。对于中国经济复兴的悲观论点，没有任何的根据。
