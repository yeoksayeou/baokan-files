　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese workers are rising up in opposition to the anti-union and wage-suppressing measures of the Yoshida government, which is supported by MacArthur Headquarters. Since the beginning of March, there have been strikes in the electrical, railway, and shipping industries. Electrical workers are demanding an increase in the minimum wage. Railway workers are demanding an 18% wage increase, the restoration of the right to strike which was repealed by the Yoshida government on MacArthur's instructions, and exemption from wage income tax. They are demanding the reinstatement of dismissed government employees (as most Japanese railways are state-owned, railway employees are government employees) and the reduction of the weekly working hours to 48. They are calling for political action to overthrow the Yoshida government, which is taking repressive measures against workers. Japanese sailors are refusing to work overtime until their demands for increased base pay are satisfactorily resolved. 400,000 Japanese chemical industry workers are discussing the issue of unified organization within various chemical industry associations.

　　日本工人纷纷起来
  　反对吉田政府压低工资
    【新华社陕北十四日电】电通社东京讯：日本工人纷纷起来反对由麦克阿瑟总部所支持的吉田政府的反工会及抑低工资的措施。三月初以来，就有电气工业、铁路与船业的罢工。电气工人要求提高最低工资。铁路工人要求增加工资百分之十八，恢复为吉田政府按麦克阿瑟指示而取消的罢工合法权利，并免征工资所得税。他们要求恢复被解雇的政府机关员工的工作（按日本大部份铁路为国有，铁路员工即为政府机关员工），并把每周工作时间缩短为四十八小时。他们号召以政治行动推翻对工人采取高压手段的吉田政府，日本海员在他们提出的增加工资底薪的要求圆满解决以前，拒绝做任何逾时工作。日本四十万化学工业工人在各化学工业组合中正进行统一组织问题的讨论。
