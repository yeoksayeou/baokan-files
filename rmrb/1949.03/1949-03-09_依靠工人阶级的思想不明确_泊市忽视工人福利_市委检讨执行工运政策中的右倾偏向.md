(Jizhong Electric) The Botou Municipal Party Committee has reviewed certain right-leaning deviations in the implementation of its labor movement policies. In the past, the Municipal Party Committee had strived to correct "leftist" deviations in the Botou labor movement, implement the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, and achieved great success. It dispelled the concerns of capitalists in hiring workers, and various industries increased their workforce by over a thousand, resulting in rapid development. However, in the implementation of labor movement policies, there still exists a right-leaning deviation of neglecting workers' welfare. This is mainly because the Botou Municipal Party Committee's thinking on relying on the working class to build the city is not clear enough, workers' welfare is neglected, and it feels helpless or indifferent to workers' interests, so that they cannot be properly resolved in a timely manner. For example, some workers and staff in private factories are still implementing the old system of capitalists' highly exploitative holiday gifts, while the monetary wage system is, under the current circumstances, causing great losses to workers, so that some employees cannot maintain their livelihoods. Hengji's Tongfeng and other iron factories ostensibly have a payment in kind wage system, but in reality it is still a monetary wage system. Some private factories, because workers become cadres, assume they are Communist Party members and dismiss the workers; they also restrict apprentices and staff from participating in union activities and the freedom to attend meetings. Workers' welfare programs such as cultural entertainment, learning, hygiene, and cooperatives have also been neglected. Conversely, some private factories and workshops have excessively long working hours, such as the bamboo ware, sock, and iron stove industries, where workers work for fifteen or sixteen hours a day. The term of apprenticeship is still four years. Based on the above situation, the Botou Municipal Party Committee has conducted a deep review, which has aroused great attention, and proposed the following suggestions for improvement: (1) Vigorously implement the policy of the whole party doing labor movement work. The propaganda and education departments should organize and lead workers in learning, and the production departments should organize and lead workers' cooperatives, to establish the idea of relying on workers to build the city. Thoroughly examine policies, implement policies, and overcome right-leaning deviations in the labor movement. Strengthen class education for workers, raise political awareness, and thoroughly resolve workers' wages, working hours, welfare and other issues in the labor movement. (2) Strengthen political work among workers. Public factories such as the Electric Light Company and the public-private joint venture Yonghua Match Company should have strong Party cadres dedicated to Party work among workers, and strengthen the leadership of the trade union. (3) Strengthen workers' learning and improve their political and cultural level. Establish workers' spare-time schools in factories, and set aside six hours a month for collective classes. (4) Guarantee workers' jobs and resolutely oppose factory owners and shop owners dismissing workers without reason or pretext. Guarantee workers a certain standard of living, stipulate new contracts and adjust working hours on the principle of both sides' willingness and without affecting workers' health. (5) Strengthen workers' welfare undertakings, establish a city-wide workers' club, and hold workers' entertainment evenings every month. Strengthen workers' hygiene work to ensure workers' health. The Municipal Baokang Hospital will be expanded and traditional Chinese medicine will be added. Larger factories such as Yonghua and Zhonghe will establish off-site canteens and worker consumer cooperatives, and help workers set up family services and handle savings.

### 依靠工人阶级的思想不明确　泊市忽视工人福利  市委检讨执行工运政策中的右倾偏向

　　依靠工人阶级的思想不明确
  　泊市忽视工人福利
    市委检讨执行工运政策中的右倾偏向
    【冀中电】泊头市委检讨执行工运政策中，存在某些右倾偏向。市委过去曾努力纠正泊头工运中“左”的偏向，贯彻发展生产劳资两利的政策，曾经获得了很大成绩，打破了资方雇用工人的顾虑，各行工业增加工人千余，得到迅速的发展。但在执行工运政策上还存在着忽视工人福利的右倾偏向，这主要是由于泊头市委对依靠工人阶级建设城市的思想不够明确，忽视了工人福利，对工人利益问题表示束手无策，或漠不关心，以致未能及时得到正确解决。例如私营工厂的工人职员有的仍旧执行着过去资方高度剥削工人的年节赠送制，同时货币工资制，在目前情况下，工人吃亏很大，致有的职工不能维持生活。恒记之同丰等铁厂，口头是实物工资制，实际仍是货币工资制。有的私营工厂因工人当干部，便认为是共产党员，就解雇工人；另外还限制学徒职员参加工会活动和开会的自由。在工人文化娱乐、学习、卫生、合作社等福利事业上，亦被忽视。相反的有的私营工厂、作坊工人工时过长，如竹货业、袜子业、铁炉业等，一天工作达十五、六小时。学徒的年限仍为四年。根据以上情况，泊头市委作了深刻检讨，已引起高度重视，并提出今后改进意见：（一）大力贯彻全党做工运工作的方针，各宣教部门组织与领导工人学习，生产部门组织与领导工人合作社，树立依靠工人建设城市的思想。深入地检查政策，贯彻政策，克服工运中的右倾偏向。加强对工人的阶级教育，提高政治觉悟，彻底解决工运中工人工资、工时、福利等问题。（二）加强工人当中的政治工作。公营工厂如电灯公司和公私合营的永华火柴公司，应有强有力党的干部专做工人中党的工作，加强对职工会的领导。（三）加强工人学习，提高政治文化水平。以工厂为单位，建工人业余学校，每月抽出六个钟头集体上课。（四）保证工人职业，坚决反对厂主、店主无故或借故解雇工人。保证工人一定生活水平，在双方自愿不影响工人健康的原则下，规定新契约，调整工作时间。（五）加强工人福利事业、建立全市工人俱乐部，每月召开工人娱乐晚会。加强工人清洁卫生工作，保证工人健康，市保康医院扩大，添设中医。规模较大工厂如永华、中和建立外工食堂与工人消费合作社，并帮助建立工人家务，办理储蓄。
