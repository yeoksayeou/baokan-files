Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th: The Jiawang Coal Mine in northeast Xuzhou has already established several employee welfare facilities, including cooperatives, canteens, and employee children's education. The cooperative supplied 100,000 jin of grain to employees in January. There are also many kinds of daily necessities, and the prices are lower than the market. The cooperative is now preparing to expand its business scope, adding flour mills, soap factories, and laundry, barber, and breeding units. The employee canteen is specifically to solve the cooking difficulties of single workers and outside workers. After opening in January, an average of 1,400 to 1,500 people eat in the canteen every day. Canteen staff and office expenses are paid by the mine. The canteen is open every day. Workers eat with vouchers, which is very convenient. In addition to a staff hospital for the medical treatment of injured and sick workers, there are also clinics set up in the mine shafts, so that workers who become temporarily ill during mine work can be treated quickly. Regarding the education of employees' children, the mine has a primary school for children, and a vocational school for workers and miners equivalent to a junior high school is being reorganized. There are currently 101 students in the first and second grades of middle school and 966 primary school students.

　　贾汪煤矿解决职工困难
  　扩大职工福利设施
    【新华社华东八日电】徐州东北贾汪煤矿已举办的职工福利设施，现有合作社、食堂、职工子弟教育等数种。合作社一月份供应职工的粮食有十万斤。另有各种日用品甚多，价格均较市场低廉。该社现正准备扩大营业范围，增设面粉厂、肥皂厂以及洗衣、理发、饲养等单位。职工食堂专为解决单身工人及外工的做饭困难，一月份开办后，每天平均有一千四五百人在食堂吃饭，食堂员工及办公费用等，均由矿方开支。食堂每日开放。工人凭券吃饭，甚为便利。对工人伤病的医疗除设有职工医院外，又在矿井下设置诊疗所，使矿井工作中临时得病的工人能迅速受到疗理。对职工子弟的教育，该矿现有子弟小学一所，另有相当于初级中学的工矿职业学校正在整顿中。现有中学一、二年级生一百零一人，小学生九百六十六人。
