Ping City Commodity Price Trends

　　Oil and Sugar Prices Drop
　　Gauze Stable
　　Due to the increase in foreign goods, prices of non-staple foods generally declined yesterday. Sesame oil, pork, mutton, and white sugar each fell by two or three yuan to seven or eight yuan per jin.

　　Millet and other coarse grains have fluctuated daily, but the fluctuations have been minimal, generally remaining stable. Millet jumped three yuan per jin on the 15th, because although a large amount of wheat and corn had arrived in Ping from Zhuozhou and Liangxiang recently, few fine grains came to the city from Matou area. Therefore, general speculators rushed to purchase, raising market prices. The trading company has sufficient reserves to supply, and the Tianjin trading company is also vigorously selling, so yesterday the price of millet in the city has fallen back, and millet flour and soybeans have also fallen in price. Gauze is priced evenly due to the increase in outside cloth vendors. Three-tripod gauze fell twenty yuan per bundle.

### 油糖价下落　纱布平稳

　　油糖价下落
  　纱布平稳
    副食品因外货增多，昨日价格呈普遍下落趋势，香油、猪肉、羊肉、白糖每斤下落二、三元至七、八元不等。
    小米及其他杂粮，日来均互有涨落，但波动甚微，一般仍呈平稳，小米十五日曾每斤跳三元，原因系日来虽涿州良乡曾有大批小麦、玉米来平，但马头一带细粮来市者不多，故一般投机商贩即争相购进，抬高市价。贸易公司有足够存粮足以供应，津市贸易公司亦大力抛售，故昨日本市小米价已回落，小米面、黄豆亦落价。纱布因外来布贩增多，价平，三鼎纱每捆落二十元。
