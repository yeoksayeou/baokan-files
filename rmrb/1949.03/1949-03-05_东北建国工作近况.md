Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 27th – In order to implement the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party’s "Resolution on the Establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League" and the "Draft Constitution of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League," the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast New Democratic Youth League recently issued instructions and decisions regarding the establishment of the Youth League in Northeast China. In its instructions, the Northeast Bureau requested that the local Party committees in Northeast China, in accordance with the spirit of the above two documents of the Central Committee, review the past leadership of youth work and the Youth League, summarize their experiences, and improve their work. In order to cultivate Youth League cadres at all levels in a planned manner, the Northeast Bureau instructed the Party committees of all provinces, cities, and counties in Northeast China to run Youth League schools or training classes, select outstanding young male and female Party members or non-Party youth activists for training, as the foundation and backbone for carrying out the establishment of the Youth League in the future.
    At the same time, the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast New Democratic Youth League has decided that, from now on, the draft constitution of the League proposed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will serve as the current constitution of the Northeast New Democratic Youth League, and the previously announced "Provisional Constitution of the Mao Zedong Youth League in the Northeast Liberated Area" will cease to be implemented. It also requires Youth League organizations at all levels and all Youth League members in Northeast China to formulate study plans, carefully read and discuss the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution on the establishment of the League and the draft constitution of the League, and use this to review the work of Youth League organizations at all levels and individual Youth League members, and to formulate specific steps for implementing this resolution and the draft constitution of the League.
    The work of establishing the New Democratic Youth League in the Northeast Liberated Area has made considerable progress in the past three months. The Youth League organizations in various places have begun to expand from points to surfaces, from large cities to small and medium-sized cities and large enterprise departments such as railways and mines. In Harbin, the earliest city to establish the League, in addition to the five sub-leagues and one hundred and twenty-two branch leagues established in various government offices, schools, factories, and urban streets, there are also fifty-five independent groups. Jilin Province has also developed the work of the League very rapidly. In Jilin City, more than 1,600 new Youth League members have been added in the past three months, more than two and a half times larger than in early November last year. Municipal Youth League headquarters have been established in Jilin, Yanji, and Longjing, and Youth League organizations have also been established in counties such as Huadian and Dunhua. In Songjiang Province, the League has been established in Mudanjiang City and counties such as Wuchang, Shuangcheng, Bin County, Shangzhi, and Acheng, with a total of 2,000 Youth League members. The work of establishing the League in Nenjiang Province has expanded from Qiqihar City to outlying counties. Now, Youth Leagues have been established in 19 counties and cities such as Taoan and Tailai, with a total of more than 3,000 Youth League members. Heilongjiang, Hejiang, and Andong provinces have also made achievements in establishing the League. Changchun and Shenyang have focused on carrying out the work of establishing the League in some factories and schools. As for the work of establishing the League in various enterprise systems, the heavy industry sector has developed the fastest. The various departments under the Northeast Railway Administration have now established five general branch League headquarters, one sub-league headquarters, and thirty-five branch league headquarters, developing 1,026 Youth League members. In the mines, such as the Jixi Coal Mine, the work of establishing the League has been carried out in seven units, including the affiliated staff and workers' school, and 320 Youth League members have been initially developed. As of now, there are a total of 20,000 Youth League members in the entire Northeast region. The reason why the work of establishing the League in various parts of Northeast China has made such progress is due to the active leadership of the local Party committees and the gradual improvement of the political awareness of the youth masses. Youth League members in various places have played a great role in production, study, supporting the front lines, and building people's power, and they enjoy extremely high prestige among the youth. Youth League members in some enterprise departments have become the backbone of production.

　　东北建国工作近况
    【新华社东北二十七日电】中共东北中央局、东北新民主主义青年团筹备委员会，为了贯彻执行中共中央“关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议”和“中国新民主主义青年团团草案”，特于日前分别分发出关于东北建团工作的指示和决定。东北局在指示中要求东北各地中共党委根据中央上述两个文件的精神，检查过去对于青年工作和青年团的领导，总结其经验，提高其工作。为了有计划的培养青年团的各级干部，东北局责成中共东北各省、市、县委应举办团的学校或训练班，选择优秀的男女青年党员或党外青年积极分子加以训练，作为今后开展建团工作的基础和骨干。
    同时，东北新民主主义青年团筹备委员会已决定自即日起以中共中央所提出的团章草案作为东北新民主主义青年团目前的团章，过去所宣布的“东北解放区毛泽东青年团暂行团章”，停止实行。并要求东北各地各级团的组织和所有团员制订学习计划，仔细阅读和讨论中共中央关于建团的决议和团章草案，并依此来检查各级团组织和团员个人的工作，订出实施这一决议和团章草案的具体步骤。
    东北解放区新民主主义青年团的建团工作，最近三个月来已有了相当发展。各地团的组织已开始由点扩展到面，由大城市扩展到中小城市及铁路矿山等大企业部门。建团最早的哈尔滨市现在除各机关、学校、工厂及市街中已建立了五个分团、一百二十二个支团外，并有五十五个独立小组。吉林省发展团的工作也很迅速。吉林市在最近三个月内即增加了一千六百多个团员，较去年十一月初扩大了两倍半。吉林与延吉、龙井三个市均建立了市团部，其他如桦甸、敦化等县也都有团的组织。松江省已在牡丹江市及五常、双城、宾县、尚志、阿城等县建立了团，共有团员两千个。嫩江省建团工作已由齐齐哈尔市扩展到外县。现洮安、泰来等十九个县、市都建立了团，共有团员三千余人。黑龙江、合江、安东等省建团亦有成绩。长春、沈阳两市则有重点地在部分工厂、学校中展开了建团工作。至于各企业系统中的建团工作，则以重工业部门发展最快，东北铁路管理局所属各部现已建立了五个总支团部，一个分团部，三十五个支团部，发展团员一千零二十六人。矿山中如鸡西煤矿在其附属职工学校等七个单位内进行有重点地建团，亦初步发展团员三百二十人。截至目前为止，全东北地区共有团员两万人。东北各地建团工作能获如此进展，是由于各地中共党委积极领导及青年群众政治觉悟逐渐提高的结果。各地青年团员们在生产、学习、支援前线、建设人民政权等工作中起了很大的作用，他们在青年中威信极高。某些企业部门的团员并已成为生产中的骨干。
