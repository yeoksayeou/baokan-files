　　[Reported by this newspaper] Professors from Peiping Universities, including Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Li Jinxi, Xu Beihong, Qian Duansheng, Luo Changpei, Yang Zhensheng, Yu Pingbo, Lu Zhiwei, Wu Han, Qian Sanqiang, Fei Qing, Fei Xiaotong, Yan Jingyao, Lei Jieqiong, Xiang Da, Fan Hong, Cao Qinghua, Yuan Hanqing, Wen Jiasi, Lou Bangyan, and Li Guangtian, Qian Weichang, among a total of one hundred and fourteen individuals, held a tea party at the Beijing Hotel yesterday (24th) afternoon at 3 PM to discuss the Chinese cultural circles' endorsement of the World Peace Declaration and matters related to attending the Peace Congress. Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, was also invited to participate. The tea party was presided over by Professors Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, and Wu Han. Professor Zhang Xiruo delivered a speech stating: "Due to the frantic instigation of a new world war by American imperialism, world peace is being threatened. Prominent cultural figures from around the world have initiated a World Congress in Defense of Peace to shatter the conspiracies of the new war instigators. We, the university professors of Peiping, enthusiastically endorse this call, resolutely standing on the same battle line with renowned cultural workers and peace-loving people worldwide, fighting to achieve world peace and resolutely dealing a blow to the new war instigators!" Subsequently, Professor Wu Han read the Chinese cultural circles' endorsement of the World Peace Declaration, which was unanimously supported by all attending professors. Comrade Dong Biwu gave a speech pointing out: "The Soviet Union is a strong pillar of world peace. Today, the first five-year economic construction plans of the Soviet Union and the new democracies of Eastern Europe are about to be fully completed. Our Chinese People's Liberation War is also about to achieve final victory, and the political awareness of the people around the world is increasing day by day. The forces in support of world peace are unprecedentedly strong. As long as the forces in support of peace worldwide unite around the Soviet Union, they will surely be able to prevent a new world war!" Following this, Professors Lu Zhiwei, Li Guangtian, Tang Xifeng, Yan Jingyao, Fan Hong, Yuan Hanqing, and others spoke, unanimously expressing opposition to American imperialism's instigation of a new world war, opposing the Atlantic Pact directed against the peace-loving Soviet Union, and supporting world peace. Finally, all the professors present unanimously nominated Zhang Xiruo and Xu Deheng as representatives of Peiping professors to attend the World Congress in Defense of Peace, and enthusiastically signed the Chinese cultural circles' endorsement of the World Peace Declaration. A total of one hundred and four people signed at the time. (Zhu Han)
