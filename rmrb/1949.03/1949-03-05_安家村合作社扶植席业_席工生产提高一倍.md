　　Anjia Village Cooperative Supports Mat Weaving
　　Mat Workers' Production Doubles
　　[Jinzhong Electric] The Anjia Village Cooperative in the Seventh District of Wutai County supports sideline production for the masses, and the village's mat weaving industry has gradually developed. The village has 207 households with relatively little land, averaging 2.4 mu per person. Among them, 73 households rely on mat weaving for a living. Before the land reform, mat workers lacked capital and tools. Buying raw materials and selling finished products usually meant buying a little, weaving a little, and selling a little, with one-third of the year spent on the road. After the land reform, mat workers also received a share of land and property, and their enthusiasm for production gradually increased. Starting last September, Liu Gouzai and seven other mat workers cooperated in mat weaving. The village cooperative provided 10,000 yuan (People's currency) to purchase reeds to support their mat weaving, and it bought raw materials and sold finished products for them, saving the mat workers time and expenses. In the past, they could only work for 20 days a month at most, but now they can work for 30 days. In the first month, they used 40,000 yuan worth of raw materials, and each person earned an average of 96 yuan per day, doubling the profit compared to self-production and self-sale. Other mat workers saw that Liu Gouzai's cooperative mat weaving was profitable. By November of last year, the number of people participating in cooperative mat weaving had increased to 30, and by the end of the year, it had increased to 66. Almost all the mat workers in the village are now participating in cooperative mat weaving. According to statistics, each mat worker can earn an average of 2,000 yuan per month, and their enthusiasm for production is very high. Recently, the mat weaving mutual aid society also determined a method of topping up shares based on labor and skills, and distributing "dividends" according to the shares. Generally, a skilled worker weaves four zhang per day, so topping one share for weaving four zhang of mats per day, the quality must be good, and more production is rewarded.

　　安家村合作社扶植席业
  　席工生产提高一倍
    【晋中电】五台七区安家村合作社，扶植群众副业生产，全村编席业逐渐发展。该村二百零七户，土地较少，每人平均二亩四分地，其中有七十三户依靠编席生活。土地改革前席工们因资本、工具缺乏，买原料，卖成品，一般是买一点，编一点，卖一点，一年之中三分之一的时间用在跑路上。土地改革后，席工也分得一份土地和财产，生产情绪逐渐提高了。从去年九月开始，刘苟在等七户席工合作编席，村合作社拿出一万元（人民票，下同）购买苇子扶植他们编席，并代他们买原料，卖成品，节省了席工的时间与费用。过去一个月顶多能做廿天活，现在能干三十天。头一个月共用了四万元的原料，每人每天平均赚九十六元，比过去自做自卖利润增加一倍。其他席工们看见刘苟在合作编席有利，至去年十一月份，参加合作编席的便增加到三十人，年底已增加至六十六人了，全村现在席工差不多都参加了合作编席。据统计每一席工一月平均可收入二千元，生产情绪很高。最近编席互助社又确定按劳力技术顶股，按股分“红办法。一般技术工一天编四丈，所以按一天编四丈席顶一股，质量要好，多生产的奖励。
