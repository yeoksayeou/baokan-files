　　Labor Remolds Criminals
  　A Record of the Shijiazhuang People's Court Prison
　　The Shijiazhuang People's Court Prison, like all prisons in the liberated areas, is used to suppress anti-people elements, stabilize democratic order, and protect the interests of the people. For general criminals, it adopts a policy of reform and education to give them an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. This is fundamentally different from all prisons in the old society.

　　Most of the prisoners here initially lacked a concept of labor. In order to transform the prisoners' thinking, the prison first made them experience the meaning of labor, and then organized them to participate in labor. The prison is equipped with factories for weaving, chemistry, carpentry, brick making, shoe sole sewing, carving, and fine art printing. This allows many prisoners to find legitimate jobs after their release and gradually become good citizens. In addition to subcontracting for the prison, the carpentry factory also undertakes the production of various furniture. The labor team built three brick kilns and one charcoal kiln themselves, producing 700,000 bricks in half a year. They also cultivated fifteen acres of vegetable gardens, producing 28,000 jin of vegetables throughout the year, which were used to subsidize the prisoners' food. In addition, they also formed a masonry team of more than ten people. Over the past year, eighteen people in the brick kiln have learned to make blanks, and three people have learned to fire the kiln. In the chemical plant, four people learned the complete set of skills for making alcohol, glue, paste, ink, and ink, and eight people learned half of the skills. Among them, five people made a living from this after their release. In the weaving factory, ten people learned the complete set of techniques, and five people learned some of the techniques. Among them, five people also worked in weaving after their release. Other factories have also trained many technicians. Because of their labor production, they can eat well and dress warmly in their lives. They get a haircut every twenty days, take a bath every half month, receive medical treatment when they are sick, and the interior and exterior are clean and tidy.

　　These prisoners have not only been reformed in labor, but have also made progress in politics and culture, and have cultivated their ability to self-govern. Most of the affairs in the factory are managed by the prisoners themselves. Those who are illiterate are required to recognize at least one character per day. Some people learn 200 new characters after being in prison for eight months. There are collective studies every day, and a meeting system. The prisoners are in stable spirits. In the past year, only one prisoner escaped, but was discovered and caught by other prisoners. However, the court still insisted on the principle of persuasion and allowed him to reflect on himself, which deeply moved the escaped prisoner. Such a policy of persuasion enables many prisoners not only to turn over a new leaf, but also to conduct criticism and self-criticism with each other.

　　They are criminals, and management is mandatory: they must abide by discipline and accept the punishment of the people, but they are not completely deprived of their freedom. Under certain conditions, they can assemble, correspond, and meet with family members. Those with minor cases can also ask for leave to go home after going through certain procedures. Those who have made achievements in reforming themselves can also have their sentences reduced and be released early.

　　This rational management and progressive measures are completely different from the prisons in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Many family members of the prisoners were moved to say: "The prisons of the People's Government are to reform people and teach people to learn to be good!" Therefore, they actively persuade the prisoners to abandon evil and return to righteousness.

　　劳动改造了犯罪者
  　记石家庄人民法院的监狱
    石家庄人民法院的监狱，象解放区所有的监狱一样，它是用来镇压反人民的分子，安定民主秩序，保障人民利益的。它对于一般的犯人则是采取改造教育给与自新机会的方针，这是和一切旧社会的监狱绝不相同的地方。
    这里大部分犯人开始都缺乏劳动观念，监狱为改造犯人的思想，第一步就使他们体验到劳动的意义，于是组织他们参加劳动，监狱里设备了织布、化学、木工、制砖、纳底、雕刻、美术印刷等工厂，这使得许多犯人在出狱后能够谋得正当的职业，逐渐变成一个好公民。木工厂除给监狱包工外，还承做了各种家具；劳动队自己建造了三座砖窑、一座炭窑，半年出砖七十万块；又种着十五亩菜园，全年出菜二万八千斤，都补助到犯人的伙食里去。另外他们还组成了一个十多人的瓦匠班。一年来，砖窑上有十八人学会了扣坯，三人学会烧火。化学厂有四人学会了制酒精、胶水、浆糊、油墨、墨水等全套手艺，八人学会了半套手艺，其中有五个人出狱后即依此为生；织布厂十人学会全套技术，五人学会部份技术，其中五人出狱后也以织布为业。其他工厂也都培养了不少的技工，由于他们劳动生产，在生活上他们都能吃的饱穿得暖。二十天理一次发，半月洗一次澡，有了病得到治疗，室内外清洁、整齐。
    这些犯人不仅在劳动上得到了改造，也在政治、文化上获得进步，并培养起了自治能力。工厂里的事务，大部是犯人自己来管理的。对不识字的，规定每天至少认一个字，有的人住监八个月就学会了二百生字。每天有集体学习，有会议制度。犯人们情绪安定，一年来只有一个犯人逃跑，被别的犯人发现捉回来，但法院仍坚持感化方针，让他自己反省，使这个逃犯深受感动。这样的感化方针，使不少犯人不但能改恶向善，还能互相开展批评与自我批评。
    他们是罪犯，管理上是有强制性的：必须遵守纪律，接受人民的惩戒，但并不是完全剥夺了他们的自由。在一定条件下，他们可以集会、通信、接见家属，案情轻的经过一定手续还可请假回家。改造自己有成绩的，还可以减刑提早释放。
    这种合理的管理和进步的措施，与国民党统治区的监狱比起来，是完全不同的。许多犯人的家属都被感动的说：“人民政府的监狱，是感化人叫人学好的！”所以她们都积极劝说犯人改邪归正。
