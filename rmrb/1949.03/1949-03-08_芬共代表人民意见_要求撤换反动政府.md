Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 6th: TASS, Helsinki dispatch: The "New Voice of Finland" newspaper published on February 28th a statement by Ville Pessi, General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, stating: The current government's policies have caused such dissatisfaction that the need to replace the government as soon as possible has become increasingly pressing. This has been proven in the parliamentary debates and the results of the confidence vote. At that time, the right-wing parties could barely maintain unity in supporting the government front. The policies implemented by the right-wing Social Democratic government have made their position increasingly unstable. In attempting to stabilize the national economy, the government has employed methods such as strengthening exploitation and reducing the people's purchasing power, which are typical of big capital. The government's anti-democratic domestic policies, sponsored by the Coalition Party and other right-wing elements, have aroused dissatisfaction among people with democratic ideals. Broad sections of the people also disapprove of the government's foreign policy, which has brought misfortune to the country. The policies followed by the current government are welcomed by the Coalition Party and the Agrarian League, although the Agrarian League, under pressure from farmers, has had to criticize the government. Now, the Social Democrats and the bourgeoisie are completely aligned, attempting to reorganize the government in such a way that the government's policies do not change, especially those policies that further worsen the lives of workers and rural laborers. The Communist Party, in unity with the entire People's Democratic Movement, puts forward the slogan: Finnish policies must be changed. This means that a democratic policy consistent with the interests of the people must replace the current line. This is the goal we must now fight for. To achieve this goal, the unity of the working masses is essential.

　　芬共代表人民意见
  　要求撤换反动政府
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：杜坎森·杉诺玛报于二月二十八日登载芬兰共产党总书记威利·贝西的声明称：现政府的政策，已引起如此的不满，以致及早更换政府的需要，已越来越成熟了。这在议会的质辩与信任投票的结果中已经证明，当时，右翼党派几乎不能保持支持政府阵线的一致。右翼社会民主党政府所施行的政策，使他们的地位愈来愈不稳了。在试图稳定国民经济中，政府行使例如加强剥夺与削减人民购买力之类的方法，这是大资本方法的典型。政府的反民主的内政政策，为联合党与其他右翼人士所赞助，但在有民主思想的人民中却激起了不满。广大阶层的人民，也不赞成政府给国家招致不幸的外交政策。现政府所遵循的政策，是联合党与农民党所欢迎的，虽然农民党在农民的压迫下不得不批评政府。现在，社会民主党与资产阶级完全一致，企图以这样的方法改组政府，就是说，不变更政府的政策，特别是使工人与乡村劳动人民生活更加恶化的政策。共产党与全体人民民主运动一致提出口号：芬兰的政策必须更换。这就是说：与人民利益一致的民主政策，必须代替现在的路线。这就是现在我们必须斗争的目标。为达到这一目标，劳动大众的团结是必需的。
