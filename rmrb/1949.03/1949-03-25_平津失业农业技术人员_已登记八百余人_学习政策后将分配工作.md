　　Unemployed Agricultural Technicians in Beiping-Tianjin Area:
　　Over 800 Registered
　　Will Be Assigned Jobs After Studying Policies

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The North China Government has registered over 470 unemployed agricultural technicians in Beiping and will soon assign them jobs to serve the construction of New Democratic agriculture. These agricultural technicians are graduates from the Agricultural College of Peking University, the Beiping Agricultural Technology Training Institute, and the Northeast Agricultural School. Some of them have worked at cotton improvement bureaus in Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang. Their expertise covers agricultural crops, water conservancy, forestry, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine. Among them, more advanced technicians (including those who served as technicians) account for over 100 people. During the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, their professions were not guaranteed. Some set up small stalls, and others sold their belongings to make a living. Now, after registering with the People's Government, their professions are guaranteed, and they have begun to diligently study issues related to New Democratic agricultural policies. It is expected that after completing their studies at the end of this month, they will be assigned jobs according to their strengths. People are still flocking to the government to register.

　　[Tianjin dispatch] As of now, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Military Control Commission has registered 335 unemployed agricultural and forestry technicians in Tianjin. The first group of 69 people has already departed for the old liberated areas to participate in agricultural and forestry construction. Before their departure, they were all given food and travel expenses based on the distance of their journey. In addition, more than ten people have been assigned to work in Beiping and Tianjin.

    学习政策后将分配工作
    【本报讯】华北政府登记平市失业的农业技术人员已达四百七十余人，并即将分配工作，为新民主主义农业建设服务。这些农业技术人员，有北大农学院的，有北平农业技术养成所的，有东北农业学校毕业的，有曾在平、津、保、石门等地的棉业改进处工作的。他们的技术包括农业作物、水利、林业、畜牧兽医等部门。其中比较高级的技术人员（包括当技师的）占一百余人。在蒋匪统治时期，他们职业均无保障，有的摆小摊，有的变卖衣物度日。现向人民政府登记后，职业有了保障，开始努力学习新民主主义农业政策诸问题。预计本月底学习结束后，即将根据所长，分配工作。目前到政府登记的人们仍纷纷不绝。
