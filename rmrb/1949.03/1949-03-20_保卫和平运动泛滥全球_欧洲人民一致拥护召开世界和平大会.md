　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS reports: Mass organizations in the People's Democracies of Southeastern Europe have successively issued statements, actively supporting the movement for lasting peace that is sweeping the globe. Citizens of Bucharest, the capital of Romania, sent a letter to Stalin on the 13th, expressing their determination to support the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace.

　　The Czechoslovak Writers' Union issued a declaration on the 11th regarding the issue of peace, which was passed at the recent Czechoslovak Writers' Congress. It stated: Only the joint efforts of the people of all countries can crush the sinister conspiracies of the instigators of a new war. Czechoslovak writers believe that actively participating in the struggle for peace and establishing close ties with the working class and all working people is the primary responsibility of all loyal cultural workers. The Czechoslovak Women's Committee called on all social organizations in Czechoslovakia on the 13th to establish an advocacy committee for the World Peace Supporters' Congress. The Central Committee of the Polish Teachers' Union unanimously passed a resolution on March 11 to participate in the peace conference to be held in Paris. The Polish Democratic Lawyers Association stated in a letter: The World Peace Congress will be a powerful demonstration of the forces of peace against the warmongers.

　　The Bulgarian Federation of Scientific Workers and the Writers' Union, and the Journalists' Union announced on the 12th and 13th respectively their willingness to participate in the World Peace Supporters' Congress and will make every effort to establish a strong united front for peace. Bulgarian journalists decided to further expand the struggle through newspapers and radio against the instigators of a new war and against the enemies of progress and culture.

　　Furthermore, the movement to defend peace is also developing in other countries in Western Europe. A large gathering was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the 13th to support peace and oppose the warmongering of the US and Britain and their followers. Member of Parliament Van Santess spoke at the conference, sharply criticizing the government's policy of dragging the country into war. Representatives of Indonesian organizations in the Netherlands demanded freedom for the Indonesian people and the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia. On the same day, another peace rally was held in Amsterdam. The Dutch Women's League issued a statement warmly welcoming the proposal to convene a World Peace Congress and calling on all public organizations in the Netherlands to support the movement to defend peace and stop the warmongers.

　　The French National Veterans Association issued a declaration on the 14th, saying that the French government, under the cover of the North Atlantic Treaty, wants to drag France into a war of aggression against the Soviet Union. "We refuse to participate in a war that violates our national interests. The signature on the North Atlantic Treaty is not France's signature."

　　The German Cultural Association called for the establishment of a committee to elect German representatives to the World Peace Supporters' Congress. This call is currently being discussed by German democratic organizations and prominent figures in scientific and cultural circles.
