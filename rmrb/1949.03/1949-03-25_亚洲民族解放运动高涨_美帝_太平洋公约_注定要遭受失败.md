Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. TASS, Moscow: Red Star's foreign affairs commentator writes: The foreign press is paying close attention to the negotiations that began last week among representatives of Britain and its Commonwealth nations regarding the so-called Pacific Pact. According to some sources, the signatory countries of this proposed pact will be the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Ceylon. According to other sources, Iran, Siam, and certain Central and South African countries, even the Union of South Africa, will also participate in the pact. The initiators of this new group do not conceal their attempt to entice as many countries as possible to join. The countries forming the new group aim to "supplement" the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. It is clear to everyone that this offshoot of the Atlantic Treaty is one of the nodes in the overall plan of Anglo-American world hegemony. London Radio admitted that the United States will be the "main driving force" of the Pacific group, because the other participating countries are completely dependent on the United States economically and politically. This makes it very clear that this group will be a docile tool in the hands of U.S. monopoly capitalists, an aggressive tool for launching military adventures in the Pacific. The Pacific group, organized to safeguard the interests of those contending for Anglo-American world hegemony, is primarily aimed at countering the struggle of the Asian people for independence. The national liberation movement of these countries' peoples has become a serious obstacle to Anglo-American aggression plans. The Asian people's liberation struggle is the root of the serious anxiety of Anglo-American colonialists. Even now, before the Pacific Pact exists, the U.S. and Britain have demanded that the future signatories of the pact actively suppress national liberation movements. First, the reactionary press of the U.S. and Britain has been forced to admit that all the efforts of the colonialists are doomed to failure. They have encountered an insurmountable obstacle: the powerful peace movement against the aggressive bloc. This movement has been strengthening unprecedentedly in countries around the world.

　　亚洲民族解放运动高涨
    美帝“太平洋公约”注定要遭受失败
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报外交评论员写道：外国新闻界对于英国及英属自治领代表上星期开始的关于所谓太平洋公约的谈判颇为注意。根据某些消息，这个拟议中的公约的签字国将是美国、英国、加拿大、澳大利亚、印度、新西兰、巴基斯坦及锡兰八国，而根据另一些消息，伊朗、暹罗及某些中非及南非国家，甚至南非联邦，也将参加该公约。这一新集团的发起者并不掩盖其尽可能地引诱更多国家参加该集团之企团。新集团的组成国旨在“补充”侵略性的北大西洋公约。人人都清楚，这个大西洋公约的支胍，是英美世界霸权总计划的班节之一。伦敦广播承认，美国将是太平洋集团的“主要动力”。因为其他参与国在经济上和政治上都是完全依赖美国的。这就非常明白。这一集团将是美国垄断资本家手中温顺的工具，发动太平洋军事冒险的侵略工具。为维护美英世界霸权争夺者利益而组织的太平洋集团，首先是旨在对抗亚洲人民争取独立的斗争。这些国家的人民的民族解放运动，已成为美英侵略计划的严重障碍。亚洲人民的解放斗争，乃是美英殖民者严重焦虑的根源。甚至此刻在太平洋公约还没有存在的时候，美英已要求公约的未来签字国，积极镇压民族解放运动。先是美英两国反动报界也破迫承认，殖民者的一切努力是注定要失败的。它们已遭到了不可克复的障碍，即反对侵略集团的强大的和平运动。这一运动已在世界各国空前无比地增强着。
