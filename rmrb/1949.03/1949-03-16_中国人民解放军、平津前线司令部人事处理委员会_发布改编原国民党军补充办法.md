　　According to the "Plan for Reorganizing the Former Kuomintang Army in the Pingjiao Area," to handle the post-reorganization affairs of officers at the military level and above who are surplus to the three-level organization of the former Kuomintang army in the Pingjiao area, the Personnel Handling Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front Headquarters was established on March 1st. The office is located in the north building of the former Japanese Embassy on Dongjiaomin Lane. Since its establishment, most of the surplus personnel have been able to go through the procedures in order. Those who volunteered to return to their hometowns began their journey on the 9th of this month. The reorganization work is nearing completion. However, some personnel are still hesitant and watching, and some responsible persons of the reception centers are unable to be impartial and abide by the law, causing some awaiting-reorganization personnel to not receive practical benefits and be placed appropriately. There have even been cases of maintaining the original organization, privately issuing certificates, harboring secret agents, falsely reporting family members, and passing off the fake as real. Therefore, the committee, according to the "Plan for Reorganizing the Former Kuomintang Army in the Pingjiao Area," announces supplementary measures, and notifies the personnel awaiting reorganization to go to their respective reception centers to complete various procedures before the 18th of this month. Those who fail to do so within the deadline will not be supplemented. If there are any who engage in private gain and malpractice in the handling process, or conceal public property without reporting it, they are allowed to file a complaint with the committee or come to the meeting for a face-to-face discussion. The committee will handle it as soon as it arrives, in order to allow the personnel awaiting reorganization to receive practical benefits and the handling work to proceed smoothly.

    发布改编原国民党军补充办法
    【本报讯】根据“改编平郊原国民党军方案”，办理平郊原国民党军，军部以上三级编余军官之善后事宜，中国人民解放军平津前线司令部人事处理委员会已于三月一日成立。该会在东交民巷前日本大使馆北楼办公。自成立以来，大多数编余人员，均能依次办理手续。其志愿回籍者，已于本月九日起陆续启程。现改编工作，行将告竣。但其中尚有少数人员迟疑观望，亦有少数招待所负责人，不能秉公守法，致少数待编人员，未能身受实惠，各得其所。甚至有保持原有机构、私发证件、包庇特务、捏报家属、以伪乱真之事。为此，该会特根据“改编平郊原国民党军方案”，宣布补充办法，通告待编人员务于本月十八日以前，分赴各该招待所，办理各种手续，逾期不办者，概不补办。倘有对处理徇私舞弊、对公产隐藏不报者，准予至该会控告或到会面谈，该会当随到随办，以期待编人员，身受实惠，处理工作顺利进行。
