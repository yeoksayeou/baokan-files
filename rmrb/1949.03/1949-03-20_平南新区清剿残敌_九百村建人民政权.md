　　Pingnan New District Clears Out Remaining Enemies
  　Nine Hundred Villages Establish People's Political Power
    [North China Dispatch, 17th] The Party, government, army, and people in the Daqinghe New District of Central Hebei are launching a full-scale campaign to clear out remaining enemies, in order to eliminate hidden puppet bandits and special agents who carry weapons, collude with local reactionary forces, and disrupt public security. This is being done in conjunction with establishing people's village political power and balancing the burden, initially mobilizing the masses. Social order has initially stabilized. According to statistics from ten counties, including Pingnan Zhuoliangwan (newly established county, parts of Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, and Wanping) and Jinxi Wuqing, over six hundred enemy guns have been seized, and people's political power has been established in nine hundred and one villages. The basic masses in five hundred and eighty-seven villages have initially participated in the political power, and the enthusiasm of the masses has greatly increased. The militia of Wangqingtuo Town in Wuqing County, together with the cadres of the village-stationed organs and the local garrison, carried out two joint cleanup operations, uncovering Zhang Tiemin, the extremely wicked puppet township head of Lilan City, Fang Yulin, the puppet commando captain, and more than one hundred and seventy enemy and puppet personnel. At the same time, the actions of enemy, puppet, and reactionary elements are strictly supervised, and their crimes are ruthlessly exposed in front of the masses, raising the class consciousness of the basic masses and forcing personnel from the organization to bow their heads to the people. Experience has shown that when destroying enemy and puppet reactionary organizations and establishing people's political power, different regions should be distinguished to determine different methods and work steps. In the recovered areas where there was a past work foundation, the enemy's puppet Baojia system should be quickly destroyed, and new people's village political power should be established with village cadres who had previously wandered outside, honorary soldiers, and poor and working peasants as the backbone. In new areas where there was no past work foundation, the puppet regime should be thoroughly destroyed step by step. Personnel of puppet organizations who were exploited must be strictly reviewed, and they should be told that they must perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes before the masses can forgive them. The erroneous method of treating all enemy and puppet Baojia personnel equally, regardless of their good or bad deeds or the size of their crimes, and adopting a universal policy of leniency and retention should be avoided. According to statistics from two thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine villages in ten counties of Daqinghebei, villages where the basic masses completely control political power account for only 23 percent of the total number of villages, and those where the basic masses initially participate in political power account for only 19 percent. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly prevent the breeding of complacency and paralysis. Continued efforts should be made to vigorously implement the elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit spies, destroy all reactionary organizations of the enemy and puppets, and establish revolutionary organizations in order to stabilize the new social order and achieve the goal of restoring and developing mass production.

　　平南新区清剿残敌
  　九百村建人民政权
    【华北十七日电】冀中大清河北新区党政军民全力发起清剿残敌运动，以肃清携带武器，勾结当地反动势力，破坏治安之潜伏伪匪特；并结合建立人民村政权，平衡负担，初步发动群众，社会秩序已初步安定。据平南涿良宛（新设县、涿县、良乡、宛平各一部）及津西武清等十个县的统计，已剿获敌枪六百余支，在九百零一个村中建立起人民政权，有五百八十七个村庄的基本群众已初步参加政权，群众积极性大大提高，武清县王庆坨镇的民兵曾和驻村机关干部，协同当地驻军，实行两次联合清剿，查获里澜城罪大恶极的伪大乡长张铁民、伪突击队长方玉林和敌伪人员一百七十余名。同时，严格监督敌伪反动分子的行动，在群众面前无情地揭露其罪恶，提高基本群众的阶级觉悟，迫使为组织人员向人民低头。经验证明，在摧毁敌伪反动组织，建立人民政权时，要分别不同地区，来决定不同作法与工作步骤，在过去有工作基础的收复区，应迅速摧毁敌人的伪保甲制度，以过去曾经流浪在外的村干部、荣誉军人、贫苦劳动农民为骨干，建立新的人民村政权。对过去没有工作基础的新地区，则应有步骤地彻底摧毁伪政权。对一些被利用的伪组织人员，必须严格地审查，并应向他们指明必须立功赎罪，群众才能原谅。对敌伪保甲人员不能不分好坏，不论罪恶大小而采取一律宽大与留用的错误办法。据大清河北十个县二千八百二十九个村庄的统计，基本群众完全掌握政权的村庄，仅占村庄总数百分之二十三，基本群众中初步参加政权的，仅占百分之十九。因此必须严防自满情绪和麻痹思想的滋生。再接再励，继续大力贯彻肃清蒋匪特务，摧毁敌伪一切反动组织，建立革命组织，以安定新社会秩序，达到恢复与发展群众生产的目的。
