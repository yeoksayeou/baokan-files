　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Sydney, 19th: The Chairman of the Australian Communist Party, Dixon, announced that the Australian people will never support the war being prepared by the large US corporations. The goal of the Communist Party is to make war impossible. Dixon's statement was triggered by the Australian Labor government's decision to prosecute Sharkey, the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, for supporting Thorez's statement. In order to oppose this reactionary measure infringing on freedom by the government, Dixon specifically called on Communist Party members and Australian workers to rise up against any actions that strike at the workers' movement. Dixon said that the Communist Party opposes the evil anti-Soviet war being prepared by the imperialists, while some people are working hard to suppress this opposition. Dixon emphasized that the working class will never permit the infringement of their freedom.
    At the same time, the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, Sharkey, published a statement in the "Tribune", reiterating that the Communist Party will continue to fight to defend peace until the warmongers are defeated. Sharkey said that while large corporations believe that opposing this catastrophic war violates their laws, they have no way to suppress the call to oppose evil war plans.

　　澳共总书记发表声明
    反对美帝集团准备战争
    抗议政府侵犯工人自由
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社悉尼十九日讯：澳大利亚共产党主席戴克逊宣布：澳大利亚人民决不支持美国大企业集团准备发动的战争。共产党的目标是在使战争成为不可能。戴克逊的声明是由于澳国工党政府决定检举澳共总书记夏基一事引起的，夏基曾宣布支持多列士的声明。为反对政府这一侵犯自由的反动措施，戴克逊特号召共产党员和澳大利亚工人起来反对打击工人运动的任何行为。戴克逊说共产党反对帝国主义者准备发动的罪恶的反苏战争，而有些人却在从事努力以图压制这种反对。戴克逊着重指出，工人阶级决不许可侵犯他们的自由。
    与此同时，澳共总书记夏基在“论坛报”发表声明，重申共产党将继续为保卫和平而斗争，直到击败战争贩子。夏基说，大企业集团固然认为反对这个灾难性战争是触犯他们的法律的，可是，它没有办法压住反对罪恶战争计划的呼吁。
