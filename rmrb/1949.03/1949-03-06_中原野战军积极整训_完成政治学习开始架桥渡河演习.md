Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 4th: The Central Plains Field Army is actively training in its garrison. All units have completed political study and begun military exercises. The "Jinpu" unit, through recollections and comparisons of past historical events, has gained a deeper understanding of the current situation. A certain company compared its current equipment and garrison with the past. At this time last year, they did not have submachine guns, let alone Canadian machine guns, but now they have them all. Last year, when they were training in southwestern Shandong, they were surrounded by enemies. Now, as they train, Tianjin and Pukou have been liberated, and the enemy has fled to the south of the Yangtze River. The "Yellow River" unit, after comparing the process of the waxing and waning of enemy and friendly forces, unanimously and firmly believed that the people's army is invincible. They also settled accounts for the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and at the same time, combined this with speaking out about their sufferings, so that the few comrades who had sympathy for the enemy quickly corrected their vague views and understood that the war criminals with heinous crimes must not be forgiven. The "Xiang River" unit held a current affairs test on distinguishing between genuine and false peace. The "Pinghan" unit used picture charts to conduct current affairs education, explaining them one by one in class. After seeing a picture depicting the Kuomintang falling apart, the soldiers discussed it, saying that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang had been beaten by us and scattered in all directions. Although those remnant bandits attempted to resist stubbornly, they could not prevent the victory of the national liberation cause. Many companies also compiled games such as "Capture War Criminals Alive" to assist learning. Currently, most of the political study has been completed, and some troops have begun practicing bridging, crossing bridges, and boarding ships. Feeders practice getting livestock on board, cooks practice cooking rice, and a widespread grass sandal making campaign has been launched.

　　中原野战军积极整训
    完成政治学习开始架桥渡河演习
    【新华社中原四日电】中原野战军正在驻地积极整训中。各部已进行了政治学习并开始了军事演习。“津浦”部从过去历史事实的回忆与比较中，对当前时局有了更进一步的认识。某连把自己现在的装备与驻地和过去作了比较，去年此时，他们还没有冲锋式枪，更没有加拿大机枪，现在都有了；去年他们在鲁西南整训时，周围都是敌人，现在整训时，平津已经解放，敌人逃到江南去了。“黄河”部把敌我力量的消长过程对比了之后，大家一致坚信人民军队的力量是无敌的。他们还把国民党反动派的罪恶算了帐，同时结合诉苦，使少数对敌人怀有怜悯心的同志，很快改正了模糊观点，知道了罪恶滔天的战争罪犯是决不能宽恕的。“襄河”部则举行了关于区别真假和平的时事测验。“平汉”部用图画表格进行时事教育，上课时一张一张的讲。战士们看了一张画着国民党四分五裂情形的图画后，纷纷议论说，蒋匪帮已给咱们打得东逃西散了，那些残匪虽然企图顽抗，可是怎么也不能阻止全国解放事业的胜利进行了。许多连队还编制了“活捉战犯”等游戏以辅助学习。现政治学习已大部完成，有些部队已开始演习架桥、过桥和上船，饲养员演习牲口上船，炊事员练习煮大米，普遍展开打草鞋运动。
