　　【Jizhong Electric】In order to help farmers in disaster areas and newly liberated areas to rush to sow spring wheat, the production promotion cooperatives in Renqiu, Gaoyang, Jinan (newly established county in southern Tianjin) and other counties purchased a large number of wheat seeds in preparation for timely supply to farmers for sowing. In Renqiu, most of the land in the ninety-four flood-stricken villages was not sown with autumn wheat last year. After the county promotion cooperative investigated the sowing quantity of the disaster-stricken villages, it sent cadres to Cangxian on the first day of the lunar new year to exchange wheat for 20,000 jin of spring wheat seeds, and purchased 7,000 jin of barley seeds and 6,000 jin of rice barley seeds. These seeds were transported to the disaster areas and sold to farmers at low prices. Loans and assistance were provided to the poor who could not afford to buy or exchange them. In Gaoyang, more than twenty disaster-stricken villages such as Nanma, Beipukou, and Hejiazhuang have now largely emerged from the floodwaters. According to the statistics of six villages, there are more than 9,600 mu. The county promotion cooperative sent eight cadres to the disaster-stricken villages to carry out mobilization and organization, calling on farmers to plant more early-maturing crops on the land that had emerged from the floodwaters. Regarding the seed problem, the general approach is to mobilize farmers to exchange, borrow, or adjust among themselves; the promotion cooperative provides loans and assistance to those who are really poor. The promotion cooperative has bought more than 12,000 jin of barley seeds and has begun to lend and exchange them. In the newly liberated area of Jinan, due to the heavy extortion by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the average farmer is very poor. Last year, because of the difficulty of seeds, people did not sow much wheat. This spring, the democratic government actively mobilized the masses to organize production and called on them to plant more early-maturing crops, and also gave appropriate solutions to the production difficulties of poor farmers. According to the survey of 109 villages and 3 municipalities, there are 1,815 poor households with 8,237 mu of land, which need to solve the difficulty of wheat seeds. The county promotion cooperative has purchased 277,900 jin of barley seeds and is now distributing them. The county promotion cooperative is also preparing to purchase soybean cakes with 100,000 yuan in Renminbi and distribute them to farmers for fertilization. All localities have generally begun to pound manure and send manure, and are actively preparing to cultivate and harrow the land to sow spring wheat.

　　津南等县推进社购置种籽
  　扶助灾村播种春麦
    【冀中电】任邱、高阳、津南（新设县在天津南部）等县生产推进社，为了帮助灾区和新区农民赶种春麦，购置大批麦种准备及时供给农民播种。任邱九十四个水灾村，大部土地去年没耩上秋麦。县推进社调查了灾村播种数量后，在旧历正月初一就派出干部到沧县用小麦换来了春麦种籽二万斤，购买了大麦种七千斤，米大麦种六千斤。这些种籽都运到灾区，低价卖给了农民。对于贫困无力购换者进行了贷放扶助。高阳南马、北蒲口、何家庄等二十多个灾村，现在水地大部脱出，据六个村的统计，就有九千六百多亩。该县推进社，派出了八个干部到灾区村庄进行发动组织，号召农民把脱出的水地多种早熟作物。关于种籽问题，一般的是发动农民互换转借或调剂来解决；实在贫困的推进社予以贷放帮助。推进社已经买来了大麦种一万二千多斤，开始贷换。津南新区由于蒋匪勒索惨重，一般农民非常贫困，去年因为种籽困难人们没有耩上多少麦子，今春民主政府积极发动群众组织生产，号召多种早熟作物，对贫苦农民的生产困难，也给以适当解决，按一百零九个村三个市的调查，有贫农一千八百一十五户，地八千二百三十七亩，需要解决麦种困难。县推进社已经购买了大麦种二十七万七千九百斤，现正发放。县推进社并准备以人民币十万元购买豆饼，发给农民施肥。各地已经普遍开始捣粪送粪，积极准备耕耙地播种春麦。
