　　The Happiest Day
    Female Worker Guo Xiulan, Jixian Huaxin Textile Mill
    March 8th was International Women's Day. The female workers of our textile mill lined up and walked happily towards the meeting place. When we arrived at the meeting place, the female comrades from various schools and women's training classes, and many female citizens, were already waiting for the meeting to begin. Before long, the conductor arranged the seating for the meeting, with the workers sitting in the front. The stage was decorated beautifully. A desolate empty space was transformed into a lively meeting place. I sat on the ground, facing the stage, listening quietly to the speech. The chairman said that the significance of the meeting was: in order to liberate all of China, in order to completely overthrow the feudal system, abolish arranged marriages, and eliminate all unequal phenomena between men and women, from now on, men and women will stand on the same battle line and strive to participate in production. All the words he spoke were imprinted in my heart. The meeting concluded at twelve o'clock, and the workers who participated in the parade were the pioneers. The drums and horns played and beat in the front, and the women, with their heads held high, shouted slogans and sang songs all the way until the meeting dispersed at the North Market Street. After the meeting, I recalled today's conference. It was truly joyous and exciting! In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we also held "March 8th" commemorative meetings. The Kuomintang reactionaries used "March 8th" to deceive us female workers. They talked about freedom and equality on the surface, but in reality, they confined women to a dark hell. Women had no rights, let alone status, and were plunged into a sea of suffering with no hope of escape. Today, after the People's Liberation Army arrived, they rescued us from the pit of fire and allowed us to jump out of the sea of suffering, living a happy and fulfilling life. How can we thank the People's Liberation Army? I think: workers should work hard, students should study hard, and everyone should unite, strive to develop production, support the front lines, and completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, so that we can build a new China, and workers and women across the country can all live a happy life like me.

　　最快乐的一天
    汲县华新纱厂女工  郭秀兰
    三月八日，是国际劳动妇女节，我们纱厂女工排着队伍，高高兴兴地向会场走去。到了会场时，各学校和妇训班的妇女同志们，和许多市民妇女，都在等候开会了。不一会，由指挥者布置会场座位，工人坐在前面，讲演台布置的很美丽，一个寂寞的空场，一时变成了一个热闹的会场了。我坐在地上，面向讲台，静听着讲话。主席说开会的意义是：为了解放全中国，为了彻底打倒封建制度，取消买卖婚姻，废除一切男女不平等现象，今后男女站在一条战线上，努力参加生产。所讲的话，都印在我的心里了。至十二时会毕，举行游行的工人是开路先锋。鼓号在前面吹着敲着，妇女们扬眉吐气地呼着口号，一路不断的歌唱着，至北集市街散会。会后，我回忆起今天的大会，开的真愉快，真兴奋！过去在国民党反动派统治下，也开过“三八”纪念会，国民党反动派利用“三八”来欺骗我们女工，他们表面讲的是自由平等，实际上是将妇女封锁在黑暗的地狱里过活。妇女没有权利，更没有地位，把妇女掉在苦海里，没有出头的日子。今天，解放军来到后，把我们救出火坑，让我们跳出苦海，过着快乐幸福的生活。叫我们怎样来感谢解放军呢？我想：工人应努力工作，学生应努力学习，大家团结起来，努力发展生产，支援前线，彻底消灭国民党反动派，才能建设新中国，全国的工人、全国的妇女，才能都过着和我一样的快乐时光。
