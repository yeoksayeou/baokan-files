(JiluYu Electric Dispatch) Local armed forces in Junxian and Yuanyang (newly established county, incorporating parts of Yuanwu and Yangwu) are striking at bandits and special agents, stabilizing order. In the border areas of the Fourth Sub-district of JiluYu (the area east of Xinxiang and Anyang), remnants of the Kuomintang bandits besieged in Xinxiang and small groups of local hidden bandits and special agents are frequently found to be harassing the area. Our sub-district's local armed forces have actively launched operations and achieved successive victories. The local armed forces of the Sixth District of Junxian, in coordination with the militia, captured Li Yongxi, the pseudo-Weixian Township Captain, squad leader Yang Deshi, Zhang Guangbao, the Jiaoqiao Town Captain, special agent Cui Yunting, and enemy assassination groups, totaling more than ten people, on February 21st and 22nd, seizing one machine gun and twenty-seven rifles and pistols. The local armed forces of Yuanyang County also routed more than 200 remnants of Xinxiang bandits who came to Qi Ningji in Yuanyang to seize grain and conscript soldiers on February 19th.
