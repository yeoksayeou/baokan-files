　　Chicheng Educates Opium Smokers in Production
    Changes Old Habits, Builds Over Ten Thousand Latrines
    [Chahar News] Since the end of land reform in Chicheng, the enthusiasm for production among farmers in both the new and old districts has become even higher. Masses in the second, third, seventh, ninth, and eleventh districts have collected over 2,200 cartloads of manure. Through education, many places have built latrines. According to statistics from seven districts, 11,194 latrines have already been dug, averaging one per household in the first district. This has changed the long-standing habit of the people of Chicheng of not having latrines. In order to ensure that everyone is contributing, Chicheng is transforming opium smokers and idlers everywhere. Opium smoking rehabilitation centers have been established, providing centralized education and training. Those who are stubbornly resistant are forced to participate in labor. Of the 110 opium smokers in the sixth district, 50 have returned to their villages for production after education, and 60 are still undergoing transformation and training.

　　赤城教育烟民生产
    改变旧习惯修厕所万余
    【察哈尔讯】赤城自结束土改后，新、老区农民生产情绪更加高涨。二、三、七、九、十一五个区群众，拾粪达两千二百多车。经过教育，很多地方修建起厕所，据七个区统计，已挖了一万一千一百九十四个厕所，一区平均已达到每户一个。改变了赤城人民历来不要厕所的习惯。为使人人不吃闲饭，赤城到处都在改造烟民、懒汉，成立烟民戒烟所，集中教育和训练，对顽固不化者，实行强制参加劳动。六区一百一十个烟民，现已有五十个经教育后回村生产，尚有六十个正在改造和训练中。
