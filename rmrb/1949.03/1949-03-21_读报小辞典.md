　　European Communist Information Bureau – At the end of September 1947, a conference was held in Poland with representatives from the following Communist parties: Zhdanov and Malenkov representing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Kardelj and Djilas representing the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (however, the reactionary group in Yugoslavia headed by Tito, due to pursuing an incorrect line deviating from Marxism-Leninism in fundamental domestic and foreign issues, has refused to attend the Information Bureau meetings), Chervenkov and Poptomov representing the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist), Dej and Pauker representing the Romanian Communist Party, Farkas and Révai representing the Hungarian Communist Party, Gomułka and Minc representing the Polish Workers' Party, Duclos and Frachon representing the French Communist Party, Slánský and Bašťovanský representing the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Longo and Reale representing the Italian Communist Party. The conference participants listened to reports on the informational situation of each respective Communist Party's Central Committee. Based on Zhdanov's report, the conference discussed the international situation and current tasks, and issued a declaration on the international situation. The conference studied the exchange of experiences and coordinated activities among the Communist parties of various countries and decided to establish the Information Bureau. The Information Bureau is composed of two representatives from the Central Committees of the aforementioned Communist parties. The task of the Information Bureau is to organize the exchange of experiences among the aforementioned Communist parties and, when necessary, coordinate the work of the Communist parties of various countries based on the principle of mutual agreement. It was also decided that the Information Bureau would publish a newspaper, "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy!" The newspaper is published in French and Russian, and if possible, in other languages.
　　Brazilian Communist Party – Is the most powerful and fastest-growing Communist party in South America. In 1945, the Brazilian Communist Party had only over 4,000 members, but by 1948 it had grown to over 130,000. The chairman of the Brazilian Communist Party is Yedo Fiusa. In September 1946, the reactionary Dutra government of Brazil arrested a large number of Communist Party members, but this persecution did not prevent the development of the Brazilian Communist Party and the strengthening of its power. In January 1947, the trade unions led by the Brazilian Communist Party held a general strike, blockading Santos Port, the world's largest coffee export center. Streetcars, telephones, gas, and electric lights in the capital of Brazil were brought to a standstill, fully demonstrating the great power of the Brazilian Communist Party. In the 1948 presidential election in Brazil, the Communist Party Chairman Yedo Fiusa received 600,000 votes, about one-tenth of the total votes cast nationwide, which shows that the strength of the Brazilian Communist Party is growing rapidly.
