Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd—According to news from Hankou: Bai Chongxi's Central China "Bandit Suppression General Headquarters" is actively preparing for war and is conducting large-scale conscription within its controlled areas. At the pseudo-parliamentary meeting in Hankou on the 20th, Bai Chongxi openly opposed stopping conscription, saying, "Since the peace movement, a few people have believed that conscription is an obstacle to peace, and advocated stopping conscription. This view is not correct enough." Under Bai Chongxi's policy of continuing the war, each township in Xiaogan County, north of Hankou, has been forced to provide 170 conscripts. Civilians in the cities of Shashi and Jiangling on the north bank of the Yangtze River are being forced to undergo training. All men over the age of fifteen must undergo two hours of training every day, and those in good health are selected and forced into the army. The Kuomintang authorities in Gong'an County, on the south bank of the Yangtze River, plan to conscript 9,800 men within a month. Song Xilian's Tenth Army Corps Headquarters of the pseudo-Central China "Bandit Suppression" and some of its subordinate units have moved to the south of the Yangtze River for retraining. They openly clamor that they will first go to the south of the Yangtze River for retraining and then return to the north of the Yangtze River to "suppress bandits." The Kuomintang authorities in Shashi and other places are also spreading rumors to scare the people, attempting to coerce them into fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River, but the general public hopes to get rid of the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government as soon as possible. Slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" are also frequently found on the streets of Shashi.

　　白匪崇禧积极备战
    在其辖区大肆抓丁
    【新华社中原二十三日电】据汉口消息：白崇禧的华中“剿匪总司令部”正在其辖区内大肆征兵，积极备战。白崇禧在二十日汉口伪参议会上公开反对停止征兵征粮，说是“自从和平运动以来，间有少数人认为征兵征粮是和平的阻碍，倡议停止征兵征粮，这种见解，未免太欠正确”。在白崇禧的这种继续战争的方针下，汉口北面的孝感县每乡镇被勒派壮丁一百七十名。长江北岸的沙市、江陵两县城市民正被强迫受训，凡年在十五岁以上的男子每日均须受训两小时，其中身体健康者则被抽出强迫当兵。长江南岸的公安县国民党当局计划一个月内抓丁九千八百名。伪华中“剿匪”副总司令宋希濂的第十兵团司令部及其所辖的一部分部队已开过江南补训，他们公开叫嚣说：先开过江南整训好，再回江北“剿匪”。沙市等地国民党当局并造谣恐吓人民，企图胁迫他们逃往江南，但一般人民却希望早日脱离国民党反动政府的黑暗统治。沙市街头上还时常发现“欢迎人民解放军”的标语。
