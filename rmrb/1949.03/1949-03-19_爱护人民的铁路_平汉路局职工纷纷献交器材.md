Employees of the Pinghan Railway Bureau Actively Hand Over Equipment

[Report from this newspaper] Employees of the Pinghan Railway Bureau have been actively handing over public property, demonstrating their enthusiasm for cherishing the people's railway. On February 27th, Mi Yushan, acting construction worker of the transportation group's telecommunications section of the bureau, took the lead in voluntarily handing over more than twenty pieces of communication equipment that he had hidden at home for five years, winning unanimous praise from all employees of the bureau. The seven types of wall newspapers published by the bureau's employees after liberation all called on everyone to learn from Mi Yushan. Subsequently, all employees launched a discussion on the topic of "Handing Over Public Property." The discussion among employees of the Pinghan Railway Automobile Business Office was the most enthusiastic. They held meetings for twelve consecutive days, and everyone unanimously agreed that workers after liberation should strive to build the people's railway in the position of masters. Gao Mingliang, Ma Changbin, and five other workers took the lead on the 3rd of this month in handing over more than ten types of auto parts, and immediately afterwards, more than twenty other employees handed over 409 items including tires, desks and chairs, gasoline drums, and auto parts. Employees of the Architectural Office, the Telecommunications Section, and the Pinghan Railway Bureau itself also responded by handing over public property, including: 30 sleepers, 87 pieces of electrical material, 10 desks and chairs, 8 bicycles, 17 pocket watches, and 17 blankets and bedding. In order to widely promote the movement to hand over public property, the North China Railway Workers' Representative Assembly convened a meeting on the evening of the 16th, deciding to call on the workers in the Beiping area to learn from the spirit of the Pinghan Railway workers in cherishing the people's equipment, launch a movement to hand over public property, and build the people's railway.
