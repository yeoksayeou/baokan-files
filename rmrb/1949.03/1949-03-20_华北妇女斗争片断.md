　　Fragments of Women's Struggle in North China
　　Gu Xiang
　　For the past two years, the broad masses of women in the North China Liberated Areas have contributed tremendous strength to the land reform movement and the People's Liberation War, and their political and economic status has been elevated. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China, the broad masses of women in the North China Liberated Areas immediately rose up to enthusiastically support it, and many hired and poor peasant women demonstrated in the land reform that they were capable and had the courage to act. During the movement, they joined the men in carrying out various forms of struggle against the landlords.

　　Women Rise Up: Accusations of Suffering, Distribution of Land, Defending the Fruits
　　In 1947, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang attempted to invade the Liberated Areas northward along the Pinghan Railway, the broad masses of people in the counties along the Taihang area were participating in the war effort, and the women and the elderly stayed in the villages to independently carry out land reform and capture secret agents. In Xiajin, Enxian, Jixian, Chengwu, and other areas of the Jinnan District, the tenant and debtor women, and those who had served as maids, servants, and wet nurses for landlords in the past, bravely stood in the crowd during land reform to denounce the oppression and humiliation inflicted upon them by landlords and despots. Women in Linzhang and Daming took up arms and stood guard, patrolling the villages when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang attacked; women in Yaoshan and other places automatically joined the militia to defend the fruits of their liberation. In Jiyuan and Fushan in the Taiyue area, men fought on the mountain tops, and women distributed land in the villages. Zhao Cairan, a woman from Ding County, measured the land during the day and returned home at night to make accurate calculations. She continued to work even when she was ill, saying, "As long as it is beneficial to everyone, what does a little illness matter?" Through the tempering of land reform, women's political consciousness has been raised, and they have begun a political life they have never experienced before with unprecedented vigor. Some were elected as chairpersons, and some were elected as representatives. In Dongwen Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, when representatives were elected at the poor and hired peasants' congress, two of the five representatives were women, one of whom was even elected as the temporary vice-chairperson. In the agricultural associations in various parts of the North China Liberated Areas, a large number of poor women members were recruited, and women's departments of the agricultural associations were established. In various land distribution and appraisal meetings, there were female appraisers elected jointly by all the peasants. In the Central Hebei region, more than half of the women participated in agricultural associations and the Communist Youth League. According to statistics from fifteen counties and cities, there were 276,647 male members and 277,902 female members in the poor peasant leagues, with female members accounting for more than 50%. In the new agricultural associations, there were 482,940 male members and 453,588 female members, with women accounting for more than 48% of the total membership. As women's political status improved, they began to dislike being called "so-and-so's wife" or "so-and-so's mother" and demanded to be called by their names.

　　Good Production, Guarantee Support for the Front
　　After young and middle-aged men went to the front lines, millions of working women immediately and enthusiastically took on the arduous task of rear-area production, actively helping military families and the families of civilian laborers with plowing and harvesting. In 1947, according to statistics from only four counties in the Taihang area, namely Licheng, Pingshun, Lucheng, and Neiqiu, more than 74,980 women participated in agricultural production. In the summer of 1948, in counties such as Wanping, Laiyuan, and Fangshan in the Beiyue area, Renqiu, Wen'an, Lixian, and Xinle in the Central Hebei area, and Jicheng in the Taiyue area, the average number of women participating in wheat harvesting and weeding accounted for half of all women. They engaged in spinning and weaving during the slack season. A huge spinning and weaving movement was launched in the Taihang area in 1947 and 1948. During the "Hundred-Day Spinning and Weaving Movement" in 1947, 145,538 people participated, spinning 1,369,409 catties of yarn and 88,468 catties of cloth. Other regions also spun and wove their own cloth in the same way to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing.

　　Millions of women also participated in the front-line supply work. They universally made military shoes, socks, and clothing for the soldiers at the front, supplying the needs of the People's Liberation Army. Each time, they competed with each other with great enthusiasm to complete the tasks early. In 1947, women in Yuebei in the Taiyue area made a total of 132,000 pairs of military shoes. Every time in late summer and early autumn, women in various places rushed to make winter clothes and completed a large number of cotton military uniforms and socks in a very short time, which were continuously transported to the front. They made active use of all spare time to sew, even while watching the fields. They sewed until they fell asleep in the middle of the night, and when they opened their eyes, they continued to sew. A woman in the second district of Yanggu, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, completed 400 sets of military uniforms by herself. Many socks were embroidered with words such as "Combat Hero," "People's Hero," and "Eliminate Chiang Bandits." Their every effort greatly inspired the soldiers at the front.

　　In various battles, women fully cooperated with men to support the front lines, undertaking various war support tasks. Women in the new and old liberated areas of central Shanxi were responsible for autumn food preparation, grinding military flour, receiving the wounded, and transporting grain over short distances in the rear during the support of the Taiyuan campaign. During the liberation of the Pingjin Campaign, the broad masses of women in Wanping, Liangxiang, Fangshan, and other counties in the Beiyue area organized sewing and washing teams, comfort groups, and nursing teams, and distributed them to various transfer stations. Even old ladies in their fifties and sixties continuously boiled water, cooked, and washed clothes for the army all day long, and warmly fed the wounded water and food, moving the wounded to eagerly return to the front lines.

　　Facing the Enemy, Resolute and Unyielding
　　Women in the North China Liberated Areas not only fully supported the war but also directly participated in combat against the enemy. After the Chiang bandits launched a full-scale civil war in 1946, they bravely participated in the struggle against the enemy. Women in Jinxiang and Shanxian areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan demonstrated a high degree of bravery, tenacity, and unyielding spirit, and they defeated the enemy with their intelligence. When the Chiang bandits swept through Shibeiji Village in Jinxiang, the female village chief Li Jijie was captured by the Chiang bandit army and severely tortured, forced to reveal the whereabouts of the village cadres and the location of the grain. The female village chief only cursed loudly. The bandit army cut open her mouth with a knife, but she remained brave and unyielding, not saying a word about the public grain. The heinous bandit army subjected her to electric shock. She went through countless near-death experiences, and eventually her breasts were cut off, but she still gritted her teeth and did not utter a word. During the guerrilla war in Huxi, women fought stubbornly with the Chiang bandits like men, crossing rivers and wading through water, overcoming all difficulties, and resisting the enemy together with the militia. When war support tasks arrived, some of them, regardless of day or night, braved wind and rain, and took grenades to gather stretcher bearers and civilian laborers in various villages. When the People's Liberation Army fought against the enemy on the Longhai Line in October two years ago, Li Xutong, a female Communist Party member, led the militia with a gun on her back and a grenade in her hand to bravely and resourcefully resist the Chiang bandits, and finally cleverly avoided the enemy's encirclement without any losses.

　　华北妇女斗争片断
    顾湘
    两年以来，华北解放区的广大妇女，在土地改革运动中和人民解放战争中，供献了雄伟的力量，政治和经济地位都提高了。中国土地法大纲发布以后，华北解放区的广大妇女，立即起来热烈拥护，并有许多雇农贫农妇女在土地改革中表现了她们是有办法、有魄力的。运动中，她们同男人们一道，对地主进行了各种各式的斗争。
    妇女起来了：诉苦分田　保卫果实
    一九四七年，当蒋介石匪帮企图沿平汉线北上进犯解放区时，太行区沿线各县广大群众都在参战备战，妇女和老人们就留在村里独立进行土地改革，捉拿特务。冀南区夏津、恩县、冀县、城武等地的佃户、债户妇女、和过去给地主当过使女，仆人，奶妈子的，土地改革中勇敢地站在人群中控诉地主恶霸对她们的压迫和侮辱。临漳、大名妇女在蒋介石匪帮进攻时，争先拿起武器站岗放哨，巡逻村庄；尧山等地妇女自动参加民兵，保卫翻身果实。太岳区济源、浮山等地，男人在山顶打仗，女人在村里分田。定县妇女赵彩然，白天量地，晚上回来精确的计算，累病了还是坚持工作，她说：“只要是对大家有利，自己有点小病算什么？”经过土地改革的锻炼，妇女们政治觉悟提高了，她们以空前活跃的姿态，开始了从未经历过的政治生活，有的当选为主席，有的当选为代表。冀中定县东汶村，在贫雇大会上选代表时，五个代表里就有两个是妇女，其中一个还当了临时副主席。华北解放区各地农会中，都吸收了大批的贫苦妇女会员，成立了农会妇女部，各种分田评议会中，都有全体农民共同选出的女评议员。冀中全区一半以上的妇女，都参加了农会和青年团，根据十五个县市的统计，贫农团男团员有二十七万六千六百四十七人，女团员二十七万七千九百零二人，女团员占了百分之五十以上。在新农会中，男会员四十八万二千九百四十人，女会员四十五万三千五百八十八人，妇女占会员总数百分之四十八以上。妇女们的政治地位提高，她们已经开始不愿人家再叫她们是“谁谁家媳妇”，“谁谁他娘”，而要求叫她们名字了。
    搞好生产　保证支前
    各地青壮年男子开赴前线以后，千百万的劳动妇女立即踊跃担任起后方生产的艰巨任务，积极帮助军属和民工家属耕种收割。一九四七年，仅就太行区黎城、平顺、潞城、内邱四个县的统计，参加农业生产的妇女就有七万四千九百八十多人。一九四八年夏季，北岳区的宛平、涞源、房山，冀中区的任邱、文安、蠡县、新乐，太岳区的冀城等县妇女，参加收麦锄苗的，平均占所有妇女的一半。她们在农闲的时候，就进行纺织，太行区在一九四七、四八两年，曾掀起了巨大的纺织运动。一九四七年的“百日纺织运动”中，有十四万五千五百三十八人参加，纺织了一百三十六万九千四百零九斤线和八万八千四百六十八斤布。其他各区也都同样的自纺自织，做到穿衣自给。
    千百万的妇女，同样也参加了前线供应工作。她们普遍为前方将士赶制军鞋、军袜和军衣，供应了解放军的需用。她们每次都是以高度的热情，互相竞赛，争着提早完成。一九四七年太岳区岳北的妇女共做了军鞋十三万二千双。每当夏末秋初，各地妇女就纷纷赶制冬装，用很短的时间，完成大批棉军衣、军袜，源源运送前方。她们利用一切空隙时间，积极缝做，看场的时候也做，半夜做的打瞌睡，睁开眼还是做。冀鲁豫阳谷二区一个妇女，她一人完成了军衣四百套。做成的许多袜子底上还绣了“战斗英雄”，“人民功臣”，“消灭蒋匪”等各种字样。她们的每一工作，都能给前方将士以很大激励。
    在各个战役中，妇女们全力配合男子支援前线，担任着各种战勤工作，晋中新老解放区的妇女，在支援太原作战中，后方的秋屯、磨军面、招待伤员以及短距离的运粮工作，都由妇女担任起来。解放平津战役中，北岳区宛平、良乡、房山等县的广大妇女，纷纷组织起缝洗队、慰问组、看护队，分布到各个转运站上，连五六十岁的老太太都整天不间断地给军队烧水、做饭、洗衣服，热情地给伤员们喂水，喂饭，感动得伤员们急着要重返前线。
    在敌人面前　坚贞不屈
    华北解放区的妇女，不仅全力支援战争，而且还直接参与对敌作战，一九四六年蒋匪发动全面内战后，她们英勇的参加对敌斗争，冀鲁豫金乡、单县一带的妇女，表现了高度英勇顽强和坚贞不屈的气节，她们用智谋战胜了敌人。当蒋匪扫荡金乡石北集村时，女村长李继阶被蒋匪军抓住，严刑拷打，逼问村干部哪里去了，粮食在什么地方？女村长只是破口大骂，匪军用刀把她的嘴割开，她仍是英勇不屈，关于公粮一句不说。万恶的匪军，对她施用电刑，她死去活来多少次，最后被割掉乳房，她依然咬紧牙关，一字不吐。在湖西游击战争中，妇女们和男子一样的与蒋匪顽强作战，渡河涉水，克服一切艰难困苦，与民兵一道抗击敌人。当战勤任务到来时，她们有的不管白天黑夜，不避风吹雨打，一个人拿着手榴弹，到各村集合担架民工。前年十月解放军在陇海线上与敌作战时，女共产党员李秀同背着枪、拿着手榴弹带领民兵果敢机智的抗击蒋匪，最后机警的避过敌人合击，毫无损失。
