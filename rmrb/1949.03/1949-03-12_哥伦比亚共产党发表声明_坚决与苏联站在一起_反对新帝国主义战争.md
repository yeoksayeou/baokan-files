    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 10th: According to Agence France-Presse, Bogota, March 7th: The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Colombia issued a statement saying: "If war breaks out, it will be a fierce struggle between the independence of Latin American countries and the system of enslavement that the United States uses to threaten us. If such a war breaks out, we Communists will stand with the people who oppose our mortal enemy—North American imperialism."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 10th: According to TASS, Copenhagen: The movement protesting participation in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc is expanding in Denmark. Following a protest rally of 5,000 people in Copenhagen, another rally was held in Aarhus (on the east coast). Participants expressed their determination to fight to safeguard peace and oppose the policies of aggressive blocs. A protest letter signed by more than 80,000 women was published here on March 5th. The protest letter stated briefly: We do not want to be involved in a new and terrible war. We want peace for the people and our children. We do not want to suffer for the profits of others. Therefore, we demand that the government not drag Denmark into any bloc that might involve us in war. We support all efforts aimed at maintaining peace.
