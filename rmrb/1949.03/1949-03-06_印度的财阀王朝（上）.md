　　India's Plutocratic Dynasty (Part 1)
	By A. Lionielfu

The "National Reform Outline" announced by the leaders of the Congress Party about a year ago has now vanished. India has not yet achieved true political independence. The country is divided into hostile parts. Ethnic strife threatens to evolve into a protracted civil war. The power of the feudal princes, the pillars of British colonial rule, has not been destroyed.

The "reforms" implemented by the government in various princely states have provided new support for the crumbling positions of the Maharajas. They have appointed their own fiefdoms and governors of the provinces. The land reform that the half-starved Indian peasants have longed for has also not been realized. Land remains in the hands of large landowners, and usurers still rule the countryside. The nationalization of industry promised by the Congress Party has, in reality, been thrown to the winds. When workers rise up to defend their basic rights, they are treated with severe punishment. Chauvinistic organizations and fascist groups are increasingly emboldened to raise their heads and threaten progressive elements with a reign of terror. The democratic organizations of the masses, the trade unions and farmers' associations that played a leading role in the national liberation movement, are subjected to the same brutal persecution as in the darkest days of British rule. At the same time, another trend is becoming increasingly prominent: the influence of the "plutocrats," who are clearly striving for the rule of the new India, is constantly and rapidly growing.

This trend deserves special attention. Undoubtedly, there lies within it one of the main reasons for the strange developments that have become characteristic of the Congress Party's policies.

While the Japanese zaibatsu have a hundred-year history, the rise and political cultural history of the Indian plutocracy is only a matter of recent years. The rise of the Japanese zaibatsu ran parallel to the rise of their feudal imperial regime, and from the beginning, they bore the mark of nationalism. The development of the Indian plutocracy is merely a by-product of the British colonial regime. Until the Second World War, its most prominent representatives were, in fact, the stewards of British capital.

The European war enabled them to multiply their wealth within a few years and seize most of the British market in India. British imports into India had almost ceased; the Governor-General's government had to entrust 90 percent of war orders to Indian companies. The tycoons of Calcutta and Bombay made staggering profits from government orders and the black market.

When British rule was on the verge of collapse under the pressure of the masses, these merchants began to engage in political activities. The leaders of the Congress Party were infiltrated by millionaires, and their influence is now evident in all aspects of national life.

Their leader and advocate is Ghanshyamdas Birla of Bombay - the boss of Birla Brothers Limited of Calcutta. A few years ago, Birla, although a big figure, was still just a small businessman. His reputation abroad was mainly due to his friendship with Gandhi. Today, he can rightly be considered one of the most powerful men in India. Some Indians call the current government in Delhi the government of "Birla Company," and not without reason. The rise of this Calcutta plutocrat vividly reveals the actual workings of the current regime in Delhi.

Birla is a major industrialist, merchant, banker, landowner, and newspaper magnate. His company directly controls seventy corporations today, including a large portion of the national economy. He owns jute mills, sugar mills, tea gardens, coal mines, steel mills, power stations, textile mills, chemical plants, paper mills, airlines, automobile and bicycle factories, transportation companies, insurance companies, and real estate companies. Birla and his associates have expanded their businesses rapidly in recent years. During the war, he founded the "United Commercial Bank" in Calcutta, which quickly became an active factor in India's industrial life. Its capital exceeds 300 million rupees, and its directors sit on the boards of directors of ninety-four other part companies.

Birla has long been closely associated with the right-wing leaders of the Congress Party and is rumored to have generously donated to the Congress Party's administrative institutions. He controls some of the most influential pro-Congress Party publications, including the "Hindustan Times" and "Hindustan" in Delhi, the "Bombay Chronicle," the "Eastern Economist," "Leader," "New India," "Searchlight," and other publications. Gandhi's son, Devadas, is an editor at one of Birla's newspapers in Delhi. Today, the dynamics of Indian public opinion are entirely controlled by Birla and two other newspaper concerns that also belong to millionaires.

It is an open secret that Birla is particularly close to S. Patel, widely regarded as the leader of the Congress Party's right wing, the Minister of Home Affairs in Nehru's government, and considered a living Buddha in the government. Patel's son, D. Patel, is a director of a company owned by Birla's friends. Birla's newspapers, and he himself from time to time, loudly proclaim the Minister of Home Affairs as the "savior of the nation."

Patel has been the treasurer of the Congress Party for many years and is the true guide of its organizational structure. Many of the current leaders of the Congress Party are his disciples and protégés. At the same time, he is regarded as the secret patron of the chauvinistic "Hindu Mahasabha," the most extreme right-wing political party in India. This organization constantly pushes the Congress Party onto the most reactionary path.

The "Hindu Mahasabha" has recently colluded with the militarist-fascist alliance "R.S.S." (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh). This alliance has incited massacres of Muslims throughout India and plotted the assassination of Gandhi. Countless facts indicate that the all-powerful Minister of Home Affairs, considered by many to be the future dictator of India, owes his career entirely to the reliable support of Birla Brothers Limited.

The second-ranked among Indian plutocrats is the Tata family. These Bombay millionaires have virtually monopolized India's heavy industry. They own a huge steel plant in Jamshedpur, employing 45,000 workers. Their concern also controls five or six power plants, engineering, chemical, cement, dye, and textile companies. In April of this year (1948), the new civil aviation company "Air India International Limited" was established under their patronage. The Tatas are planning to open a large automobile factory. They own the largest private bank - the "Central Bank of India," with capital exceeding 2.05 billion rupees.

The Tata family is another pillar of the Congress Party. This does not prevent it from cooperating closely with the British colonial government. Some of the heads of these families have received British knighthoods. Dr. J. Matthai, one of the directors of Tata Sons Limited, was the Chief Administrative Officer in the government of the Governor-General of India before and during the war. Today, Dr. Matthai is the Minister of Railways and Transport in Nehru's cabinet. Two other directors of the company - Sir A. Bewoor and Sir P.Y. Bewoor - were ministers in the British colonial government under Marshal Wavell. Today, these people appear particularly active in the organization of an Indian "national" economy. When the Congress Party first took power, C.H. Bhabha, one of the managers of the Tata Bank, was given the position of Minister of Commerce.

The third seat in the new "dynasty" belongs to the industrial Dalmia family, which controls about thirty factories, mainly in coal, electricity, steel, chemicals, sugar, paper, and cement, as well as insurance companies and "Indian National Airways Limited." The "Bharat Bank" is related to this family. Like Birla, Dalmia owns the second-largest newspaper trust in India ("Times of India," "Indian News Chronicle," "Civil and Military Gazette," "National Call," etc.), supporting the leaders of the Congress Party. Like Birla, Dalmia also funds the militarist-fascist R.S.S. - an Indian chauvinistic organization.

Another close friend of Patel is Sir B. Goenka - a wealthy Bengali banker, industrialist, merchant, and landowner, owning many companies. This family controls the third-largest newspaper trust in India. Goenka represents "Lal & Brother Ltd." of the London banking community and is a prominent director of the British-controlled "Imperial Bank of India." This bank concentrates one-third of all bank deposits in India.

The Singhanias, associated with the "Hindustan Commercial Bank" and the "J.K. Bank," dominate the provinces, and their concern encompasses forty-two factories in various industrial sectors - from cotton to steel. He has monopolized the aluminum industry in India. The head of this family - Sir P.P. Singhania - is a member of the "Indian Constituent Assembly." He is also a patron of the R.S.S. fascist gang.

H. Walchand, a large contractor in Bombay, holds the reins of the construction and shipbuilding industries, is the president of "Bank of Baroda," and has thirty factories in various industries in India, Burma, and Ceylon.

Chipriya, a financial figure famous for his close association with the reactionary "Hindu Mahasabha," has a foothold in eighty-one joint-stock companies through his "Hindustan Commercial Bank."

The Ispahanis, a Calcutta merchant family, represent the interests of Muslim capital in the group of commercial giants in the Congress Party. They made a fortune by speculating in the rice market during the terrible Bengal famine of 1943, in which millions starved to death. As members of the government's Food Grain Control Bureau, they hoarded large quantities of rice in their own warehouses, forcing rice prices to rise. Rice is the staple food of the Indian masses.

The five families mentioned above - Birla, Tata, Dalmia, Singhania, Walchand - directly control one hundred and eighty-five joint-stock companies in India. This does not include those controlled through their banks. Their financial interests are closely intertwined, and this tendency is increasingly so. For example, Birla shares the "United Commercial Bank" with Ispahanis and Goenka. Walchand holds shares in "Tata Chemicals," etc. The total capital of the six Indian banks in which these plutocrats have a foothold ("Central Bank of India," "United Commercial Bank," "Bharat Bank," "Hindustan Commercial Bank," "J.K. Bank," and "Bank of Baroda") amounts to 2 to 3 billion rupees.

It is worth noting that these consortia have established close financial ties with the feudal dynasties of the Indian princes. These princes, who continue to rule the princely states, have accumulated staggering wealth under British rule. For example, the Maharaja of J.K. is a major shareholder and patron of the "J.K. Bank," headed by Singhania. The Maharaja of Baroda is connected to the "Bank of Baroda," controlled by Walchand. The Maharaja of Gwalior is one of the largest shareholders in the "Tata Steel Plant." It is also well known that prominent feudal princes such as the Maharaja of Patiala and the Maharaja of Bikaner are close friends of S. Patel. The "reforms" recently implemented by Patel in various princely states strongly stimulate the tendency to merge the feudal aristocracy with the financial and industrial oligarchy.

These forces are exerting their increased influence on the policies of the Nehru government. The economic departments of the Congress Party are filled with their agents. The leaders of the various government departments controlling industrial sectors were all appointed by D. Tata, the chairman of "Tata Company," when he served as a colonial administrator in Britain. Of the fourteen members of the advisory board appointed by Nehru to plan India's new national economy, nine are representatives of big business or officials colluding with big business.

　　印度的财阀王朝（上）
    Ａ·里奥尼尔夫  作
    国大党诸领袖约于一年前所宣布的“全国改革大纲”，现在已荡然无存。印度仍未达到真正的政治独立。国家分裂成敌对的两部分。民族争斗有演变为绵延的内战之虞。英国殖民地统治的支柱封建王公的权力未遭摧毁。
    政府在各土邦所实行的“改革”，大君们底摇摇欲坠的地位有了新支柱。他们曾任命自己采邑和各省的总督。半饥饿的印度农民已渴望多时的土地改革亦未兑现。土地仍操在大地主手中，高利贷者仍然统治了农村。国大党所许诺的工业国有化，实际上被丢在九重天外。当工人起来捍卫他们的基本权利时，却以严刑对待。沙文主义组织和法西斯社团，正愈益斗胆地抬起头来，并以恐怖统治威胁进步分子。群众的民主组织在民族解放运动中起领导作用的职工会和农会，受着和英国统治时最黑暗的时代一样残酷的迫害。同时，另一个趋势日益显著：显然正在争取新印度的统治的“财阀”底影响，不断迅速的增长着。
    这个趋势值得特别注意。无可置疑，这当中存在着成为后来国大党政策的特征的奇怪发展的主因之一。
    日本财阀有一百年的历史，印度财阀的崛起和政治文化史仅是近几年的事，日本财阀的崛起，与其封建帝制政权之兴并行，而他们从一开始就带有民族主义的铃记。印度财阀的发展不过是英国殖民地政权的副产物。直到第二次世界大战为止，它的最显著代表，实际上是英国资本的二管家。
    欧洲的战争，使他们能在几年内增殖其财富，摄取英国在印度的大部分市场。英国向印度的运入几乎已经停止；总督政府不得不将百分之九十的战争定货委托各印度公司。加尔各答和孟买的巨贾，从政府的定单和黑市中获得惊人利润。
    当英国的统治在群众压力下颓然欲倒时，这些商贾开始从事政治活动。国大党诸领袖的左右渗入了百万巨富，他们的势力现在已呈现于国民生活的各方面。
    他们的魁首和鼓吹者是孟买的甘塞亚姆达斯·拜尔拉——加尔各答拜尔拉兄弟有限公司的老板。数年前，拜尔拉虽是个大人物，却还不过是个小商人，他在国外的声名主要是由于他与甘地的友谊，今天他可以正确地被认为是印度最有权力者之一。某些印度人士把德里的现政府称为“拜尔拉公司”的政府，不为无因。这位加尔各答财阀的暴发，生动地透露出德里现政权的实际工作。
    拜尔拉是个大工业家、商贾、银行家、地主和报纸巨头。他的公司今天直接控制了七十个社团，包括国民经济各部门的巨大部分。他拥有麻厂、糖厂、茶园、煤矿、钢厂、电站、纺织厂、化学工厂、纸厂、航空公司、汽车和自行车厂、运输公司、保险公司和不动产公司。拜尔拉及其同伙在近年来的商业曾急遽扩大。在战争中，他在加尔各答创办了“统一商业银行”，这个银行很快就成为印度的工业生活中的积极因素。它的资金超过了三万万卢比，它的董事们是九十四个其他部分公司董事会的董事。
    拜尔拉早已与国大党右翼领袖们密切往还，传闻曾慷慨捐助国大党的行政机构。他控制了一部分最有势力的亲国大党出版机构，包括德里的“印度斯坦时报”和“印度斯坦”“孟买纪事报”，“东方经济学者”，“领袖”，“新印度”，“探照灯”及其他刊物。甘地之子狄瓦达斯便是德里拜尔拉的一家报纸的编辑。今天印度的舆论动态全操在拜尔拉和同样属于百万巨富的其他两家报纸康采恩手中。
    拜尔拉的特别与Ｓ·巴特尔相交已是公开的事，巴特尔乃众认为国大党右翼党魁，尼赫鲁政府的内政部长，并被认为是政府中的活佛。巴特尔的儿子Ｄ·巴特尔，是拜尔拉友人的一家公司的董事。拜尔拉的报纸，时时是他自己，大声吹嘘内政部长乃“国家之救主”。
    巴特尔多年来即为国大党的司库，并且是它的组织机构的真正指导人，现在国大党的领袖，许多是其弟子和被庇护者。同时被认为是全印度政党中最极右派的沙文主义的“印度麻哈萨巴”的暗中护神。该组织不断促使国大党走上最反动的道路上。
    “印度麻哈萨巴”近来又和军国主义——法西斯同盟“Ｒ·Ｓ·Ｓ·（国家公仆会）”勾结起来。这个同盟在印度各地煽起对回教徒的屠杀，策划行刺甘地。无数的事实指明，众认为印度未来的独裁者的全权的内政部长，其事业全凭拜尔拉兄弟有限公司的可靠支持。在印度财阀中居第二位的是塔塔家族。这些孟买百万巨富实际上已垄断了印度的重工业。他们在哲姆西德蒲耳拥有庞大的炼钢厂。雇用员工四万五千人。他们的康采恩亦控制了五六个电厂、工程、化学、水泥、染料和纺织公司。今（一九四八）年四月，在他们庇护下成立了新的民航公司“印度国际航空有限公司”。塔塔们正计划开办一家大汽车厂。他们拥有最大的私营银行——“印度中央银行”，其资金达二十亿五千万卢比以上。
    塔塔家族是国大党的另一支柱。这并不阻止它与英国殖民地政府密切合作。这些家族中一部分的首脑得到英国的爵位。塔塔父子有限公司的董事之一的Ｊ·马太博士，在战前和大战中，曾是印度总督政府中的首席行政官，今天马太博士是尼赫鲁内阁的铁路运输部长。该公司的其他两位董事——Ａ·比乌尔爵士和Ｐ·Ｙ·比乌尔爵士，曾是魏菲尔元帅下的英国殖民地政府中的部长。今天这些人在一个印度“国家”经济的组织中显得特别积极。当国大党甫执国政，塔塔银行经理之一的Ｃ·Ｈ·布哈巴哈，即分得商业部长一职。
    新“王朝”的第三把交椅是工业的达尔米亚家族，它控制了三十家工厂左右，主要是煤、电、钢铁、化学、糖、纸和水泥，以及保险公司与“印度全国有限航空公司”。“布哈瑞特银行”和这个家族有关连。和拜尔拉一样，达尔米亚拥有全印第二大的报纸托拉斯（“印度时代”、“印度新闻纪事”、“军民新闻”、“民族呼声”等等），支持着国大党领袖们。和拜尔拉一样，达尔米亚，也资助军国法西斯的Ｒ·Ｓ·Ｓ·——印度沙文主义的组织。
    巴特尔的另一位知交是Ｂ·戈恩卡爵士——豪富的孟加拉银行家、工业家、商贾和地主，拥有许多公司。他这一族控制了印度第三大的报纸托拉斯。戈恩卡代表伦敦银行界的“拉利兄弟有限公司”，又是英国控制的“印度帝国银行”的显赫董事。这个银行集中了全印银行存款的三分之一。
    与“印度斯坦商业银行”及“齐浦尔银行”有关的辛格哈尼亚家族，雄霸各省，他们的康采恩襄括工业各部门的四十二家工厂——从棉花直到钢铁。他已垄断了印度的铝工业。这一家族的首脑——Ｐ·Ｐ·辛格哈尼亚爵士，是“印度立宪会议”之一员。他也是Ｒ·Ｓ·Ｓ法西斯匪帮的护神。
    Ｈ·窝尔千德，孟买大营造商，执建筑及造船业之牛耳，“巴洛达银行”行长，在印度、缅甸和锡兰的各种工业中间有三十家工厂。
    因与反动的“印度麻哈萨巴”过从甚密而著名的金融界齐普利亚，通过他的“印度斯坦商业银行”插足于八十一家股份公司中。
    加尔各答商贾家族——伊斯巴右尼斯，代表在国大党商业巨头集团中的回族资本的利益。他们在一九四三年孟加拉的可怖灾荒中，以投机米市暴富，在那次的饥荒中饿毙者数百万。身为政府食米管制局委员，他们把大批的米囤积在自己的栈房里，迫使米价上涨。大米是印度群众的主食物。
    上述中之五个家族——拜尔拉、塔塔、达尔米亚、辛格哈尼亚、窝尔千德——直接控制了印度的一百八十五家股份公司，他们通过其银行所控制的还不算，他们的金融利益是紧密地纠合一起，而这种倾向愈来愈是这样。例如，拜尔拉就与伊斯巴哈尼斯和戈恩卡分享“统一商业银行”。窝尔千德握有“塔塔化学厂”的股票等等。这些财阀所插足的印度六家银行（“印度中央银行”，“统一商业银行”，“布哈瑞特银行”，“印度斯坦商业银行”，“齐普尔银行”和“巴洛达银行”）的总资金达二十到三十亿卢比。
    值得注意的是这些财团已与印度王公的封建王朝建立了紧密的金融关系。这些王公现仍继续统治各土邦，已在英国统治下积累了惊人的财富。例如，齐浦尔大君就是以辛格哈尼亚为首的“齐浦尔银行”的大股东和保护人。巴洛达大君与窝尔千德控制的“巴洛达银行”相通。瓜利尔大君是“塔塔炼钢厂”的最大股东之一。这也是大家都知道的，如巴提亚拉大君和比加尼尔大君等著名封建王公，都是Ｓ·巴特尔的知交。巴特尔最近在各王公土邦内实行的“改革”，强烈刺激着使封建贵族与金融、工业寡头溶合为一的倾向。
    这些力量正发挥其对尼赫鲁政府的政策的新增的影响。国大党的经济部门充满了他们的代理人。控制工业各部门的政府各个部，其领导人都是“塔塔公司”董事长达赖尔充任英国殖民地行政官时所委派的。在尼赫鲁任命计划印度的新国民经济的十四名顾问局委员中，九个是大商业的代表或是与大商业勾通的官吏。
