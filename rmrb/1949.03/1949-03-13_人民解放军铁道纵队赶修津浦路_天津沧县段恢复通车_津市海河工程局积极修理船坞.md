　　People's Liberation Army Railway Corps Rushes to Repair the Jinpu Railway
    Tianjin-Cang County Section Reopened to Traffic
    Tianjin Municipal Haihe Engineering Bureau Actively Repairs Docks
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] Delayed: The Tangguantun to Cang County section of the Jinpu Railway was completely repaired on the 27th of last month. The first locomotive departed from Tianjin for Cang County the day after the section was repaired. From then on, the Tianjin-Cang section of the Jinpu Railway, which had been out of service for one year and ten months, was reopened to traffic. The Tang-Cang section of the railway was repaired by a detachment of the People's Liberation Army Railway Corps. Since the start of construction, they have overcome the difficulty of insufficient tools and manufactured their own iron hoops and splints for bridge repairs. When repairing the Machangcheng River Railway Bridge, it was difficult to drive wooden piles for the bridge abutments and piers due to the rapid current and soft soil, but they finally managed to drive fifty-two 14-meter-long wooden piles, enabling the bridge to be built.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] The Xinshiqi branch of the Tianjin Municipal Haihe Engineering Bureau Repair Factory is actively repairing docks. The factory suffered serious damage from the Kuomintang bandit troops before liberation. High-voltage electric lights, wires, batteries, etc., in the dock were all destroyed. After liberation, thanks to the efforts of the workers and staff, they were all repaired within a week. Ships awaiting repair in the dock can now be repaired.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] The 77,000-volt high-voltage transmission line between Tianjin and Tangshan was repaired on the 6th of this month, and the Tangshan Power Plant began sending electricity to Tianjin that evening. The total power generation of the three power plants in Tianjin and the Tangshan Power Plant has now reached 38,400 kilowatts, and the city's power supply will be more adequate in the future.

　　人民解放军铁道纵队赶修津浦路
    天津沧县段恢复通车
    津市海河工程局积极修理船坞
    【新华社天津七日电】迟到：津浦路唐官屯至沧县段已于上月二十七日全部修复，第一部机车于该段修复之次日即由天津开抵沧县。从此，停驶了一年零十个月的津浦路津沧段重又恢复通车。唐沧段铁路系由人民解放军铁道纵队某支队抢修。他们在开工以来，曾克服工具不足的困难，自制修桥用的铁箍和夹板。在修马厂城河铁桥时，因水急土软，打桥台和桥脚的木桩很不容易，但他们终于设法打下了五十二根十四公尺长的木桩，使该桥得以筑城。
    【新华社天津十日电】天津市海河工程局修理厂新十七分厂，正积极修理船坞。该厂在解放以前，曾遭受国民党匪军严重破坏。船坞里的高压电灯、电线、电瓶等，全被捣毁。解放后，经过职工们的努力，在一星期内，即已全部修复。船坞中待修船只，现即可修理。
    【新华社天津十日电】天津、唐山间七万七千伏特高压输电线，于本月六日修复，唐山发电所当晚即向天津送电。现天津市三个发厂和唐山发电所的发电量的总和，已经达到三万八千四百基罗瓦特，今后全市电力供应更加充分。
