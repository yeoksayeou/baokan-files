Farmers in the Western Suburbs of Ping City Present Flags to the People's Liberation Army

[This newspaper reports] The entire village of Zhengfusi, near the airport in the western suburbs of Ping City, presented two red flags to a certain anti-aircraft artillery company of a PLA division stationed in the village. The reason for this was that since the company entered Zhengfusi Village in early February, they had enthusiastically helped the masses. They used their spare time to help the masses peel a lot of garlic, and the sixth squad alone plowed 24 mu of land for the masses. The army and the people were as close as one family. When Comrade Yu Hou, a soldier in the seventh squad, had an eye infection, Old Lady Liu, his landlord, used her mouth to suck clean water and apply it to his eye, curing him. The villagers everywhere talked about, "The troops are so good to us, how should we repay them! They won't even accept a little bit of vegetables." Later, the masses in the west end made a red flag with the words "Model of Loving the People" and presented it to the second platoon stationed in the west end. The people of the entire village also responded to this practice, and the whole village made a large red flag with the words "Friend of the People" to present to the entire company. (Peng)

　　平市西郊农民献旗给解放军
    【本报讯】平市西郊机场附近的正福寺村全体村民以红旗两面献给驻在该村的解放军某师战防炮连。原因是二月初旬该连进驻正福寺村后，曾热烈帮助群众，他们利用课余游戏时间，帮助群众剥了许多蒜，六班一个班就给群众耕地二十四亩，军民亲如一家。七班战士裕厚同志发眼，房东刘老大娘就用嘴含着净水去他眼上吮吸，给他治好了。老乡们到处谈着：“部队对咱们这样好，咱们怎样回答他们呀！给点菜他们都不吃。”后来西头的群众就制了一面“爱民模范”的红旗献给驻在西头的二排。全村的人民也响应了这种作法，全村做了一面“人民之友”的大红旗献给全连。　　　　　　　　　　　（彭）
