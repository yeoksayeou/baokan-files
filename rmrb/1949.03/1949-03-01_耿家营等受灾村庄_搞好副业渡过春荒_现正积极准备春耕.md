(Jizhong News) Villages in Luan County, Shulu County, and Xian County that suffered from floods and droughts last year are actively engaged in sideline occupations to overcome the famine. In Yanjie Village, Shen County, due to the drought last year, the crops failed, and 120 households in the village did not have enough to eat. After autumn, the masses actively developed various sideline productions, including five cotton ginning workshops, each run jointly by seven or eight families, totaling fifty people, and the production was very enthusiastic. For example, the Minsheng Cotton Ginning Workshop worked in three shifts, day and night without stopping, ginning 300 jin of cotton per night, earning 140 jin of cottonseed. There were also fifteen households making noodles, driving three flour mills, and organizing twenty peddlers to sell on their behalf. Some also organized weaving factories, driving the masses to spin and wind yarn. In this way, the living problems of the masses were largely solved. Woman Luo Jiusu said, "The grain harvested last year would not have lasted through the winter, but this production campaign has earned us enough grain to eat through the winter and spring." Du Sheng earned 300 jin of rice in the winter, and doesn't have to worry about living in the spring. Almost all households in the village have enough to eat. Now the farmers are preparing for the spring production campaign.

In Gengjiaying, Shulu, due to the drought last year, all 100 households in the village did not have enough to eat. Since the launch of sideline production after autumn, every household has been very busy, making bellows, ginning cotton, weaving, running transportation and sales, doing whatever they can. There are more than 30 households making bellows alone, and each bellows can earn 80 or 90 yuan in People's Currency. People are busy day and night. Geng Zhenzi and his brother, known as the "Manure-Picking Kings," get up every day at the crack of dawn to pick manure. Each of them picks at least a basket of manure every morning, accumulating a pile of manure in two months. Now, people are using the money earned from production to buy food, fertilizer, and farm tools, preparing for the big production.

In Shucai Village, Xian County, there are 55 households weaving baskets. In the autumn, they jointly dug five cellars and weaved baskets in groups. On average, each person can weave four or five baskets per day. Zhao Xingshun's group of four people wove 480 in a month. Cai Yinjian wove the most, 300 in a month and a half. Each basket can be sold for an average of 45 yuan in People's Currency, earning a net profit of 25 yuan. He earned a total of 7,500 yuan, bought 3,750 jin of grain, and his family cannot finish eating all that he earned.

　　耿家营等受灾村庄
    搞好副业渡过春荒  现正积极准备春耕
    【冀中讯】滦县、束鹿、献县等三县，去年受水旱灾村庄，积极从事副业渡荒。深县阎解村，因去年旱灾庄稼歉收，全村有一百二十户不够吃的，过秋以后，群众积极地开展了各种副业生产，计有轧花坊五个，每个花坊都是七八家合伙开办，共五十人，生产都非常上劲。如民生轧花坊，分三班黑夜白日不停工，一宿就弹轧三百斤棉花，可赚一百四十斤棉籽。还有十五家做挂面，带动了三家磨面，组织二十个小贩代卖。还有的组织织布工厂，带动了群众纺线络线。这样一来，群众的生活问题大部分解决了。妇女骆九素说：“去年打的粮食，连冬都熬不过去，这一闹生产，赚的粮食一冬一春也吃不清。”杜生一冬赚了三百斤米，一春的生活不发愁了。全村差不多各户都够吃的了。现在农民正准备闹春季大生产。
    束鹿耿家营，因去年旱灾，全村一百户，家家不够吃。自过秋开展副业生产以来，家家户户都很紧张，做风箱、轧花、纺织、跑运销的干什么的都有，光做风箱的就有三十多家，做一个风箱可赚人民币八九十元，人们都是黑夜白日不住闲。耿贞子哥俩，有名的“拾粪大王”，每天鸡叫就起来拾粪，一早每人顶少拾一筐粪，两个月就积了一圈粪。现在人们把生产赚来的钱，除了买吃的就是买肥料置农具，准备大生产。
    献县束蔡村有五十五户编筐的，秋天伙着挖了五个地窖子，分组编筐，平均每天每人可编四五个。赵兴顺组四个人，一个月编了四百八十个。蔡印俭编的最多，一个半月编了三百个。一个筐平均可卖人民币四十五元，得纯利二十五元，他共赚了七千五百元，买了谷子三千七百五十斤，全家光赚来的就吃不清。
