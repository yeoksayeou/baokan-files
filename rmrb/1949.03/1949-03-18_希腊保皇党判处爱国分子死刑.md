Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 17th: According to a Telecommunications Agency report, after the Greek Royalist fascists murdered Beveligas, they sentenced three Greek patriotic and democratic figures, including Glezos, to death, saying they attempted to join the Greek Democratic Army. The Secretary-General of the International Association of Journalists protested strongly to the Athenian Minister of Justice on the 13th and requested the UN Secretary-General Lie to support the rescue of Glezos. Several well-known French intellectuals also telegraphed the reactionary government in Athens to protest. Signatories included the writer Gide, Paul, and the Director of the Atomic Energy Research Institute, Joliot-Curie.
