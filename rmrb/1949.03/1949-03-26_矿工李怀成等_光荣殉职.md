　　Miner Li Huaicheng and Others
  　Gloriously Sacrificed
    [Taihang Telegram] Li Huaicheng, captain of the underground team of the Jiazhang Coal Mine in Changzhi and a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as miners Yan Changfa and Li Anjing; and Zhang Taishan, an underground transport worker at the Shao Ming Coal Mine in Neiqiu, and other four comrades, gloriously sacrificed their lives in mid-February. More than 200 people from the Taihang Industrial Company's offices and accounting training class held a memorial meeting on March 4. Jia Chongzhi spoke on behalf of the company's Party Committee. He said: These four worker comrades were unfortunately sacrificed in the recovery work after the frame was dismantled and by falling rocks in the mine. We should learn from their spirit of self-sacrifice for the revolutionary cause. He also called on all comrades on behalf of the Party Committee to strengthen safety work, reduce and eliminate dangers; technical personnel must be truly responsible to reduce losses; and oppose numbness and indifference to safety equipment.
    According to reports, Comrade Li Huaicheng consistently worked actively throughout his life. Since arriving at the Jiazhang Mine, he always stood at the forefront of production and overcoming difficulties, and was never afraid of dangers in the mine. In the spring of 1947, he was once trapped in a coal cave. When he was rescued and comforted, he resolutely said: "Are we afraid of sacrifice for the revolution?"

　　矿工李怀成等
  　光荣殉职
    【太行电】长治贾掌煤矿井下队长、中共正式党员李怀成同志及矿工阎长法、李安景；内邱邵明煤矿井下运输工张太山等四人，于二月中旬先后光荣牺牲。太行实业公司机关全体人员及会计训练班共二百余人，于三月四日集会追悼。贾冲之代表公司党委会讲话。他说：这四位工人同志，都是在矿下拆架后的回采中和矿下落石所压而不幸牺牲的，我们应当学习他们为革命事业而自我牺牲的精神。他并代表党委会号召全体同志加强保安工作，使危险减少、消灭；技术人员要确实负责，减少损失；反对麻木不仁，对安全设备不关心的态度。
    按李怀成同志生前一贯积极工作，自到贾掌矿以来，始终站在生产和克服困难的最前列，矿下的危险从不畏惧。一九四七年春，曾被堵在一个煤洞里，当他被救出并受慰问时，他刚强地说：“革命还怕牺牲吗？”
