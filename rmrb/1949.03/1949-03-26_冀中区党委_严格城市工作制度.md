　　Jizhong District Party Committee
  　Strictly Enforces City Work System
    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of Party member cadres at the administrative office level and from various agencies in Baoding City on March 12th to rigorously establish formal work and study systems after entering the city. At the meeting, Liang Shuangbi, Deputy Secretary-General of the District Committee, conveyed the District Committee's regulations on establishing work and living systems after entering the city, saying: "Administrative offices and directly subordinate agencies must first implement a collective office system, determine office hours and visitor procedures; the morning study system must be adhered to, and it has been decided that all agencies stationed in Baoding City will implement a Sunday rest system." He pointed out that the crucial element in establishing and adhering to these systems is strengthening discipline and organization. Following this, Comrade Zhang Jun of the District Committee conveyed the District Committee's instructions on rectifying and strengthening the leadership of cadre study, pointing out that the fundamental reason why study had not been done well in the past was the failure to conscientiously implement the District Committee's instructions. It is now necessary to appropriately adjust the organization of the Study Committee branches and various branches, strengthen leadership, strictly classify levels, and establish formal systems. He emphasized that the Study Committee should be fully responsible for leading the cadre's study well, and that the Party's agency branches and organizational life should regard the inspection of the study system as one of the important work contents, and conduct regular tests. Finally, Sun Yi, Commander of the Jizhong Military Region, called on all cadres to observe time, cherish time, improve work efficiency, strictly abide by the system, and overcome the decentralized and irregular work habits of the past in rural areas.

　　冀中区党委
  　严格城市工作制度
    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委，于三月十二日召开行署一级及保定市各机关党员干部会议，严格树立入城后的正规工作制度与学习制度。会上区党委副秘书长梁双壁传达区党委关于建立进城后工作制度和生活制度的规定时说：“行署级及直属机关首先必须实行集体办公制度，确定办公时间及会客手续；早晨学习制度必须坚持，并决定驻保市各机关实行星期日休息制度。”他指出：这种制度的建立与坚持，重要的环节是加强纪律性和组织性。继由区党委张君同志传达了区党委关于整顿与加强干部学习领导的指示。指出：过去学习没有搞好的基本原因，是没有认真贯彻区党委的指示。现在须适当调整学委分会和各支会的组织，加强领导，严格编级，树立正规制度。强调学委会应完全负责把干部的学习领导好，党的机关支部和组织生活应把检查学习制度作为重要工作内容之一。并定期实行测验。最后，冀中军区司令员孙毅同志号召全体干部，遵守时间，爱惜时间，提高工作效率，严格遵守制度，克服过去在农村中分散的不正规的工作习惯。
