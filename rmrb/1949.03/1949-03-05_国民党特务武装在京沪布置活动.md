Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Reliable sources: The Kuomintang secret agent armed force "National Defense Ministry Youth Salvation Corps," commanded by war criminal Chiang Ching-kuo, with its four detachments and affiliated "Volunteer Forces," totaling over 10,000 men, has been ordered to operate in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou and along the Canton-Hankou Railway areas. Their mission is to cooperate with the Kuomintang bandit army in controlling key points such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Changsha, as well as various transportation lines in southern Jiangsu. This Kuomintang secret agent armed force was recently formed by combining three secret agent armed forces under the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense: the "Suppression and Construction Brigade," the "Pacification Corps," and the "People's Service Army" 1st and 2nd Detachments. On February 23rd, the pseudo-President of Nanjing, Li Zongren, issued an order to "abolish the Suppression and Construction Brigade and hand it over to the Ministry of National Defense for resettlement" as one of his seven "peace" measures. The aforementioned facts prove that the so-called "abolition of the Suppression and Construction Brigade" is merely "abolishing" a name.

　　国民党特务武装在京沪布置活动
    【新华社陕北一日电】确息：由战犯蒋经国指挥的国民党特务武装“国防部青年救国团”四个总队及其所属“义勇部队”共万余人，已奉命在京沪杭及粤汉铁路沿线地区活动，担负配合国民党匪军控制南京、上海、杭州、长沙等要点及江南各交通线的任务。国民党的这支特务武装，是最近由伪国防部所辖“戡建大队”、“绥靖总队”及“人民服务军”第一、二支队三支特务武装合组而成的。按南京伪代总统李宗仁于上月二十三日曾通令“裁撤戡建大队，交由国防部另行安置”，作为他的七项“和平”措施之一。上述事实，证明所谓“裁撤戡建大队”，不过是“裁”了一个名子。
