Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 11th: According to TASS, the book "The True Face of American Diplomats" has been published in Moscow. This book was written by Ms. Booker, an American who resigned from her position as Deputy Director of the Press Office at the US Embassy in the Soviet Union a year ago and remained in the Soviet Union. In the book, Ms. Booker lists numerous names and facts, exposing everything she witnessed while working in the American intelligence agencies and later at the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, revealing how American spies infiltrated the Soviet Union under the guise of diplomats, journalists, and "experts" to carry out espionage activities. The anti-Soviet clique of American diplomatic officials, following the will of Wall Street monopolists, encouraged various anti-Soviet conspiracies and anti-Soviet slanders, attempting to provoke an anti-Soviet war. Booker pointed out that the current US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, is a professional spy who forces every employee in the US Embassy in the Soviet Union to engage in espionage activities and collect intelligence under the guise of "travel." The personnel of the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, led by Smith, also used diplomatic privileges to illegally import foreign currency and tax-free goods for speculative profit-making activities.

　　“美国外交人员的真面目”
    布克尔揭露美帝反苏间谍活动
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据塔斯社讯：“美国外交人员的真面目”一书，已在莫斯科出版。该书由一年以前辞去美国驻苏大使馆新闻处副处长职务并留居苏联的美国人布克尔女士所著。布克尔女士在该书中列举了许多人名和事实，揭露她从前在美国谍报机关以及后来在美国驻苏大使馆工作期间所目堵的一切，揭露美国间谍在外交人员、新闻记者和“专家”等各种伪装面目下混入苏联，进行间谍活动。美国外交官员的反苏小集团遵循华尔街垄断资本家的意旨，鼓励各种反苏阴谋及反苏的诽谤，企图挑起反苏战争。布克尔指出现任美驻苏大使史密斯是一个职业谍报员，他强迫美驻苏大使馆中的每一个职员都进行间谍活动，并在“旅行”的名义下收集情报，以史密斯为首的美驻苏大使馆人员，并利用外交官的特权，非法输入外币并免税输入商品，以进行投机营利的勾当。
