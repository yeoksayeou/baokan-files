(Jinzhong Electric Dispatch) The Jinzhong District Trading Company and other state-owned stores have purchased livestock in large quantities to help farmers solve the problem of draft animal shortages. In order to implement the decision of the Jinzhong Administrative Office's production conference, the Yuchi State-Owned Tongtai Store dispatched capable cadres last month, carrying 3 million yuan (People's Currency) worth of native cloth and foreign cloth, to Xingxian, Linxian, and Qikou in Lishi along the Yellow River to purchase livestock. On the 10th of this month, the first batch of 30 draft animals arrived in Yuchi and were reported to the government to inform the masses in various districts and villages to come and buy them. In order to take care of the farmers' difficulties, in addition to selling at cost, grain, hemp rope ends, waste paper, scrap copper, etc. are also accepted as payment. Currently, the masses in the seventh district of Yuchi are jointly negotiating purchases. In order to resolutely complete the task of purchasing 300 draft animals, the store has dispatched a second batch of cadres carrying 2,000 pounds of cotton yarn to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region to exchange for livestock. The Yuchi Jinyu Public-Private Store, in addition to purchasing 74 draft animals from other districts in January and selling them to the masses, also withdrew a portion of funds on the 14th of last month and sent four cadres to buy 30 draft animals from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. After hearing the news, the masses in Xiahuang, Cai Yangbi, Chongyuan, Baitian and other villages in the second and fifth districts of Yuchi immediately bought 19 head (paying at cost). The Yuchi County Cooperative Union took out a portion of funds and borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Yuchi Branch to send people to Kelan, Fugou, and Baode counties in northwestern Shanxi to purchase draft animals, including a plan to purchase four breeding animals to help the masses breed draft animals. It is estimated that they will return to Yuchi around the 19th day of the second lunar month to attend the mule and horse fair in Changning Town. In addition, the Pingyao Fenghuamao Store of the Trading Company organized three local private livestock dealers, using their funds in conjunction with bank livestock loans, to traffic draft animals along the Yellow River. The Tongtai Store organized private merchants such as Yuchi Yiyongsheng to purchase draft animals in southern Ningxia. The Yuchi County Cooperative Union organized two private livestock dealers in Donglutai and Zikeng villages, who bought more than 10 head of livestock from other districts and sold them to the local masses.
