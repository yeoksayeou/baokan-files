　　British Vice-Consul in Prague
    Expelled for Espionage Activities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th] TASS reports: The Czechoslovak government recently discovered that the British Vice-Consul in Prague, Wildish, was engaged in reconnaissance activities, plotting to subvert the republic's regime, and expelled him from the country on the 23rd. The statement issued by the Czechoslovak government pointed out that the Czech security organs recently uncovered a secret terrorist organization plotting against the republic. A member of this organization, acting on Wildish's orders and instructions, was uniting scattered reactionaries to carry out reconnaissance and subversive activities. Wildish collected detailed intelligence on members of the secret organization: promised that Britain would assist the organization, and promised to bring back to Czechoslovakia a general who had previously fled the country to serve as the leader of the conspirators.
