Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. According to reliable sources: The long-publicized plan for the withdrawal of US troops from Qingdao has been decided by US Ambassador to the Nanjing Nationalist Government, Stuart, and US Western Pacific Fleet Commander Badger to be halted. One of the reasons for changing the withdrawal plan is Li Zongren's request, as Li Zongren hopes to maintain Qingdao as a springboard with the help of the US Navy. When US Secretary of the Army Royal and others, along with US Joint Military Advisory Group to the Nationalist Government Chief Batave, met in Tokyo at the beginning of this month, they decided to adopt a policy of supporting Li Zongren.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Nationalist Party's Central News Agency on the 27th of last month: The US Joint Military Advisory Group to the Nationalist Government, which announced the cessation of work on January 27th, has recently been ordered to retain its original name. Most of the personnel of the group who withdrew to Japan, including the group leader Batave, have not been withdrawn to the United States, but have been left in Tokyo and temporarily "reassigned" by the US occupation forces headquarters in Japan.

　　美军继续侵驻青岛
  　联合军事顾问团保留名义
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据可靠方面消息：宣传已久之青岛美军撤退计划，已经由美国驻南京国民党政府大使司徒雷登和美国西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔决定停止执行。改变撤退计划的原因之一是李宗仁的请求，因为李宗仁希望借美国海军的帮助以保持青岛的跳板。按美国陆军部长罗雅尔等一行与美国驻国民党政府联合军事顾问团团长巴大维等于本月初在东京开会时，曾决定采取支持李宗仁的政策。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据国民党中央社上月二十七日东京电透露：已于一月二十七日宣布停止工作的美国驻国民党政府联合军事顾问团，最近忽然又奉命保留原来的名义，该团撤至日本的大部分人员，包括该团团长巴大维在内，并未撤回美国，而被留在东京，由美国对日占领军总部暂时地“改派工作”。
