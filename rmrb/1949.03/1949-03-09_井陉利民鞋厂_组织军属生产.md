　　Jingxing Limin Shoe Factory
  　Organizes Production for Military Dependents
    [Our Dispatch] The Jingxing Limin Shoe Factory has mobilized workers inside and outside the factory to actively produce and solve the living difficulties of their families. Since its opening on April 1st last year, the factory has targeted families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, cadres, and impoverished households, absorbing a total of ninety-two people to participate in the work; those who were not admitted into the factory can earn wages by sewing shoe soles to subsidize their lives. Up to now, the factory has spent a total of 250,000 catties of millet. For example, the young worker Xu Chaosheng used to beg for food. After the liberation of Jingxing, he joined the factory last year and can get a salary of more than ninety catties of millet per month, in addition to food. Honorable soldiers Du Baojing, Yu Zhongyuan, and Yi Quanzhen, due to physical disabilities, were unable to engage in agricultural production. After participating in the factory's work, all of their families' difficulties have been resolved. In villages near the factory, the village governments introduce thirty to forty dependents of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, cadres, and impoverished people every day to receive shoe soles (each pair can earn 2.5 catties of millet). According to recent statistics, more than thirty villages near the factory come to receive shoe soles, spending 2,000 catties of millet every day, which has solved many difficulties. Currently, workers inside and outside the factory are actively producing shoes to overcome the spring famine. (Kang Weizhong)

　　井陉利民鞋厂
  　组织军属生产
    【本报讯】井陉利民鞋厂，发动厂内外工人，积极生产，解决全家生活困难。该厂于去年四月一日开办以来，以烈、军、干属与贫苦户为对象，共吸收九十二人参加工作；未被吸收入厂者，则以纳鞋底获工资补助生活。截至目前为止，该厂共支出二十五万斤小米。如小工人许超圣从小要饭，井陉解放后，去年参加厂内工作，每月除吃外可得工资九十余斤小米。荣誉军人杜保敬、于中原、伊全祯等人，因身体残废，无法从事农业生产，参加了该厂工作后，已全部解决家中困难。在厂外附近村的烈、军、干属与贫苦者，每天由各村村政府介绍来领鞋底者达三十人至四十之多（每双可得小米二斤十二两）。据最近统计，厂附近共三十多个村来领鞋底，每天支小米二千斤，解决了不少的困难。现该厂内外作鞋工人，正积极生产，渡过春荒。（康伟中）
