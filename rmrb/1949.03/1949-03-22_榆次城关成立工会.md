　　Taiyuan Branch Dispatch: Yuci Chengguan District convened a worker representative meeting on March 4th and formally established a trade union. Forty-one male and female representatives attended, representing more than twenty industries, including cotton weaving, iron and wood, coolies, and clothing, comprising over a thousand workers. After Liu Junming, of the workers' preparatory committee, reported on the workers' movement situation over the past two months, Comrade Zhao Shoushan, secretary of the county party committee, made a profound self-criticism regarding the past failure to clearly establish the idea of relying on the working class to build a new city. This had resulted in many workers still suffering from illegal oppression and exploitation by private capitalists, with some workers not even having the freedom to hold meetings, and some working as many as fourteen or fifteen hours a day. In the cotton weaving industry alone, seven workers had been laid off since the Lunar New Year, and other such right-leaning phenomena. His self-criticism received warm support from the representatives. The representatives then raised many opinions regarding the implementation of the "labor-capital both benefit" policy in developing production, methods for appropriately improving workers' treatment, and ensuring the implementation of the factory's reasonable production plans, cherishing production tools, and actively engaging in production.
　　On the afternoon of the 5th, Zhang Mingda and sixteen others were formally elected as members of the trade union committee, and the trade union was officially established.

　　榆次城关成立工会
    【太原分社电】榆次城关区于三月四日召开职工代表大会，正式成立职工会，到会男女代表四十一人，代表棉织、铁木、苦力、被服等二十余种行业一千余工人。职工筹委会刘俊明报告两个月来的职工运动情况后，该县县委书记赵寿山同志对过去没有明确地树立起依靠工人阶级建设新城市的思想，致使许多工人还在受着私人资本家的非法压迫和剥削，有的工人连开会的自由都没有，有的每日做工达十四五小时，仅棉织业旧历年后即解雇了七个工人等右的现象，作了深刻的检讨，受到代表们热烈拥护。接着代表们提出许多关于发展生产中贯彻“劳资两利”政策的意见，适当改善工人待遇的办法，和保证执行厂方合理的生产计划，爱护生产工具，积极生产。
    五日下午正式选举张命大等十七人为职工会委员，职工会当即正式成立。
