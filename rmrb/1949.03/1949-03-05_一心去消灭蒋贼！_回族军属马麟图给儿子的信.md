　　Devoted to Eliminating the Chiang Bandit!
  　Letter from Hui Muslim Military Family Member Ma Lintu to His Son
    In the Third Branch of a certain mobile hospital on the Jinzhong Front, there are two Hui Muslim comrades. Both of them have been in the army for more than a year, and their parents are very concerned, often writing to urge them to make progress.
    The first letter read: "Work hard and commit to serving the people, this is what your parents expect of you..."
    The second letter said: "...The village is taking good care of us, hoping you will make progress in your work and study; it is necessary to obey superiors; be friendly to comrades; returning home for a reunion after the liberation of the whole country will be the most glorious..."
    Recently, Ma Xuemeng's family sent another letter, asking him to keep his promise (three months ago, Comrade Xuemeng wrote to his family in response to their requests), to work hard, and reported on the situation of Chiang's army in the village. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Xuemeng: I have received both of your letters. Do not worry. You must put the words in your letters into practice. Victory will come soon. After eliminating the Kuomintang bandit gang, we too will enjoy the happiness of the new society!
    This time, during the village's recruitment work, our family was allocated seven mu of land and some movable property. After this, we will be better off and will never be poor again! Our class status has been publicly determined as poor peasant.
    On the first day of the Lunar New Year, all the village cadres paid a New Year's visit to our house. Lanterns were hung on the door, indicating that we are the family of a meritorious person serving the people. In the afternoon, the village, on behalf of the county and district, invited all the families of military personnel to a forum. At the meeting, in addition to the village cadres presenting New Year's cards from the Director and Deputy Director of the Administrative Office and extending New Year's greetings on behalf of the Director and Deputy Director, the village cadres all reviewed their past shortcomings in taking care of military families and asked each of our military families to put forward some suggestions, which the village cadres happily accepted. In addition, the meeting also discussed whose strength the victorious New Year was obtained by, and planned how to cultivate the land on behalf of the military families in the future. The village cadres said, "The sons of military families are out fighting old Chiang, we are the sons of military families, and we will never allow an inch of land belonging to military families to lie fallow!" They also divided the masses into groups to carry water and do odd jobs for military families without labor. The meeting did not end until it was dark. I hope you will work hard after seeing this letter! Devote yourself to fighting the Chiang bandit, eliminating Chiang Kai-shek, and don't worry about home!

### 一心去消灭蒋贼！　回族军属马麟图给儿子的信

　　一心去消灭蒋贼！
  　回族军属马麟图给儿子的信
    晋中前线某机动医院三分院有两个回族同志，他们俩参军都是一年多的时间，他们的父母非常关心，常常来信敦促他俩进步。
    第一封来信上这样写道：“要努力学习，抱定为人民服务的精神去干，这是父母对你的要求……”
    第二次来信说：“……村中照顾周到，望儿工作学习务要进步；对上级必要服从；对同志也要友好；等到解放全国后回家团圆，是最光荣的……”
    最近马学梦家又来了一信，信中要他信守诺言（按前三个月学梦同志曾致信与家答复父母的要求），好好工作并报告了村中蒋军情形，信的全文如下：
    学梦：你来了两封信我都收到了。勿念。信上说的话要你实际去做，胜利很快就要到来，消灭了国民党匪帮，咱也享享新社会的幸福！
    这次村中抽补工作，分予咱家七亩地，浮财一部。这以后咱就好过了，永久不会再受穷！咱的阶级成分，已经公议为贫农。
    正月初一，全体村干部给咱家拜年。门上挂灯，表明了咱是为人民服务的功臣家属，下午村里又代表县区请各位家属开了一个座谈会，会上除村干部献出行署主任及副主任的拜年片，并代表正副主任拜年外，村干们都检讨了过去照顾军属的不够，并让咱各家军属提出了些意见，村干部很愉快的接受了。此外会上还讨论了胜利新年是依靠谁的力量得到的，并计划了将来如何代耕法。村干部们说：“军属的儿子在外打老蒋，我们就是军属的儿子，绝不让荒废军属一分地！”并把群众分了组，以便与无劳力的军属担水及做零活，会议直至黑天才毕，希儿见信后努力吧！要一心去打蒋贼，消灭蒋二秃子，不要挂念家了！
