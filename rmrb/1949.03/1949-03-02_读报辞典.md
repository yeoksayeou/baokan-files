　　Communist Party of Czechoslovakia—The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, abbreviated as the CPCz, was formed by progressive members of the Social Democratic Party after a national general strike in December 1920. By 1925, the CPCz had become the fourth largest party in the country, holding 30 seats in the 300-seat parliament. In September 1938, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy met in Munich (in southern Germany). In order to encourage Germany to attack the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and Italy agreed to sacrifice Czechoslovakia, ceding the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Germany. The CPCz was the only party at the time that resolutely opposed the imperialist agreement to sacrifice Czechoslovakia and encourage German aggression. During Hitler's occupation of Czechoslovakia, the CPCz sacrificed 25,000 members, including 42 central committee members, in the struggle for national independence and freedom against fascist aggression. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia on May 9, 1945, the CPCz enjoyed extremely high prestige among the people. Within a year, its membership grew from 500,000 to 1 million. In the first election after liberation, the CPCz won 38 percent of the vote, becoming the largest party in the country. CPCz Chairman Klement Gottwald formed a new government of the People's Democratic Front. After a comprehensive party rectification in the spring of 1947 and the victorious crushing of the reactionary traitorous incident last February, the CPCz's political prestige has increased unprecedentedly. According to statistics from last May, the CPCz membership had reached 2,048,000. In the May 30th election, the National Front led by the CPCz won over 89 percent of the vote, occupying 293 of the 300 seats in parliament. In June, the Social Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia merged with the CPCz, bringing the total membership to 2.5 million. The first Central Committee plenary session after the merger was held on November 17, deciding to implement a comprehensive party rectification and a new charter for admitting individual members, and stipulating that the party's Ninth National Congress should be held on May 25 this year.

　　Gottwald—Klement Gottwald is the current chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the president of the Czechoslovak Republic. Born in 1898, he was originally a carpenter. After the founding of the CPCz in 1921, he abandoned his carpentry career and devoted himself to the revolution, becoming an outstanding cadre of the Czech Communist Party. In 1925, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee at the party's Third National Congress. In 1926, he served as the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee. After the party's Fifth National Congress, under Gottwald's leadership, overcame reformism and opportunism within the party, he was elected as the General Secretary of the party. At the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in 1935, he and Georgi Dimitrov (the current Chairman of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Prime Minister of Bulgaria) jointly formulated the People's Front program, making it the basis for concentrating democratic forces and defeating fascism. After Czechoslovakia was betrayed by the Munich Agreement in 1938, Gottwald organized the entire party to go underground. In November, he was ordered by the Party Central Committee to go to Moscow, where he directed the great Czech national liberation movement. In April 1945, Gottwald served as Deputy Prime Minister in the first cabinet after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. In May 1946, he served as Prime Minister of the cabinet. Under his leadership, land reform and industrial nationalization were implemented, and a two-year plan was formulated. In February 1948, he defeated the traitorous rebellion of reactionary elements. On May 9, he promulgated the new constitution, and on June 14, he was elected as the third president of the Czechoslovak Republic, leading 12 million Czechoslovak people towards a happy socialist society.

　　Baltic Sea—Located in northwestern Europe, it is the sea that flows the deepest into the land in the world, with an area of more than 440,000 square kilometers and an average depth of 76 meters. Two hundred rivers flow into this sea. Maritime transportation is convenient, but it often freezes in winter, requiring icebreakers to guide navigation. The northeastern coast of the Baltic Sea is Finland; the southeastern coast is the Soviet Union; the southern coast is Poland and Germany; Denmark is at the southwestern entrance, and the western coast is Sweden. The Baltic Sea is the Soviet Union's maritime passage to the Atlantic Ocean. The US imperialists' aggressive plot to win over the Baltic Sea countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty is being relentlessly exposed by the Soviet Union, Poland and other countries and actively resisted by the people of the Baltic Sea countries.

　　Bao Dai—Is the former puppet king of Vietnam, and the thirteenth generation of the Nguyen Dynasty. After he inherited the throne in 1932, he willingly served as a puppet of French rule in Vietnam. During World War II, after the Japanese invaders occupied Vietnam, he became a tool of the Japanese invaders. It was not until the Japanese invaders surrendered and the Vietnam Independence League was established that he was forced to abdicate. Now that the Vietnamese people's struggle against French imperialism is about to be victorious, the French reactionary government has picked up this docile tool again, preparing to use it to deceive the Vietnamese people.
