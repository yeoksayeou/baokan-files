Tangshan Guanghua Paper Mill

　　Labor-Management Relations Initially Improve
　　Improving Technology Increases Production

[Tangshan Electricity] Under the leadership of the democratic government, the Tangshan Guanghua Paper Mill, based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital and promoting economic prosperity, has initially improved labor-management relations (How were they improved? - Editor). Both parties are now working together to develop business and gradually improve the lives of workers. Recently, the workers of the factory, according to the spirit of improving technology and doing good work, actively provided improvement opinions to the factory, which achieved good results. The factory has two steaming pots. In the past, the factory instructed that steaming wheat straw required three hours, and mulberry bark and reeds required three and a half hours. The former required adding 20 catties of ash, and the latter required adding 30 catties of ash. The workers had long discovered that the cooked materials steamed in this way were too fine and rotten, and were washed away during filtration, resulting in a large loss. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the workers had no desire to improve. After liberation, workers Zhang Ximing, Wang Jialin and others voluntarily studied and improved the steaming pot technology, gradually shortening the time for steaming wheat straw and the like. They also discovered that in the past, steam was passed as soon as the pot was loaded, and the gas was only released when the pot was discharged, which was too wasteful. After more than 20 days of patient testing, it was changed to steaming wheat straw with one hour of steaming followed by half an hour of stewing. The time was halved compared to before, steam consumption was reduced by one-third, and the amount of charcoal used was reduced from 20 catties to 10 to 15 catties, while the steamed material remained the same. The blankets used for papermaking were quite expensive. In the past, they were easily damaged due to too much ash being added, so the amount of ash was reduced. In order to save consumption, the factory had an old and broken small air pump, which they repaired and can now be used. The Guanghua Factory currently has more than 40 workers and produces 1,700 to 1,800 catties of wrapping paper per month. The machinery factory was built during the Japanese and puppet period, and after the Kuomintang took over, it was under the jurisdiction of the pseudo-Hebei Provincial Construction Department. It had never started work. In August last year, the Kuomintang leased it to private individuals (for a lease term of ten years). After liberation, this relationship was temporarily maintained.

    劳资关系初步改善
  　改进技术提高生产
    【唐山电】唐山光华造纸厂在民主政府领导之下，根据劳资两科、繁荣经济的原则，初步改善劳资关系（如何改善的？——编者），双方正协力开展业务，逐步改善工人生活。最近该厂工人根据改良技术做好工作的精神，积极向厂方提供改进意见，获得很好的成绩。该厂有两个蒸锅，过去厂方指示蒸麦秆需三小时，桑皮及苇子需三小时半，前者加灰二十斤，后者加灰三十斤。工人们早就发现这样蒸出来的熟材料太细太烂，过滤时冲走，损失很大。但在国民党统治时工人无心改进，解放后工人张锡明、王嘉林等六人自动研究和改良蒸锅技术，逐步将蒸麦秆等时间缩短。并发现从前自从装锅就通蒸气，一直到出锅才放气，太浪费，经过二十多天的耐心试验后，改成蒸麦秆通一小时气再闷半小时，在时间上比前缩短一倍，蒸气少消费三分之一，用炭量的二十斤减少到十至十五斤，蒸出来的材料依旧。造纸需用的毯子颇贵，过去因加灰太多易受损伤，因此将灰减少。工人为节省消耗，该厂原存一架破废小型打气机，他们又将他装好，已能使用。按光华厂现有工人四十余人，月产包货纸一千七八百斤。机器厂为日伪时所建，国民党接收后隶属伪河北省建设厅，一直未开工，于去年八月国民党租与私人经营（租期十年），解放后暂时仍维持此种关系。
