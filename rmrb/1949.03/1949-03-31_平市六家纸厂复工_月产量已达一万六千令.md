　　Six Paper Mills in Beiping Resume Production
　　Monthly Output Reaches 16,000 Reams
　　[Report from this newspaper] There are eight state-owned and private machine-made paper mills in this city. In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's large-scale purchases of foreign paper, they were unable to develop. During the August 19th pseudo-currency reform last year, the factories suffered an unprecedented blow, with as many as five factories suspending operations. Later, due to power outages, the remaining three factories also announced the suspension of operations. Since the liberation of Beiping, with the exception of Beiyang and Daxing, which were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the remaining six have quickly resumed production. The state-owned Daxin Paper Mill has two paper-making machines, one of which now produces 100 reams of paper per day. The state-owned Yanjing Paper Mill produced only 30 to 40 reams per machine per day before liberation, with a maximum of no more than 50 to 60 reams. Now, the factory's No. 1 and No. 3 machines can produce 230 reams of paper per day, more than double the pre-liberation level. The factory's No. 2 machine is planning to be modified and merged with the No. 3 machine to produce paper of better quality. Other factories, such as Yongtai, Chuqi, Yihe, and Beiping, can each produce 40 to 70 reams of paper per day. In total, the current total monthly output of the factories in Beiping is 16,150 reams. There are a total of 14 paper-making machines, 66 electric motors, totaling 1,465 horsepower, capable of producing various drafting, calendered, packaging, kraft, and book cover papers. The finished products are sold in this city, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Tianjin, and other places, and the supply falls short of demand. Therefore, the output of the factories is increasing day by day, and business is thriving. Private paper mills also have plans to increase capital and expand equipment, and they are optimistic about the future.
　　　　Raw Material Difficulties Urgently Need to be Resolved
　　[Another report] The biggest problem facing the Beiping paper-making industry at present is the shortage of raw materials. Before the war and during the puppet regime, it relied on Japan and the Northeast for the supply of pulp. After Japan's surrender, the source of pulp became difficult, and waste paper was used instead. At present, except for Daxin, which uses the remaining pseudo-currency as raw material, the other five paper mills in this city rely on the supply of waste paper in this city. According to general estimates, Beiping can produce 5,000 catties of waste paper per day; however, the five paper mills need 22,000 catties per day. If the output of each factory increases, more waste paper will be needed. Therefore, the factories believe that the difficulty of raw materials is the biggest obstacle to the development of the paper industry. In addition, the pulp factories in North China and the Northeast are still in their infancy, and the pulp produced by Tianjin Paper Company is not enough for its own consumption. The pulp factories in the Northeast also cannot supply the needs of the paper mills. The larger-scale pulp factory in Jinzhou was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops. Therefore, if the Beiping paper-making industry wants to develop, it can only rely on its own investment in pulp factories. However, establishing a pulp factory requires the addition of digesters, evaporators, converters, alkali dissolving devices, pulpers, and bleachers. These machines need to be designed and manufactured according to the performance of the paper-making machines. This is by no means something that a factory can do on its own. Therefore, on the one hand, people need to invest, and on the other hand, the government needs to help, in order to jointly complete the establishment of a pulp factory.

### 平市六家纸厂复工　月产量已达一万六千令

　　平市六家纸厂复工
    月产量已达一万六千令
    【本报讯】本市公私营机器造纸厂共有八家，过去因国民党反动政府大量购买外国纸，一直不能发展。去年八一九伪币改制时，各厂更遭受空前打击，停工的达五家。后因停电关系，其余三家也宣告停工。北平解放以来，除北洋及大兴两家遭国民党匪军破坏外，其余六家已迅速复工。公营的大信造纸厂共有造纸机二台，其中一台现在每日产纸一百令。公营的燕京造纸厂在解放前每台日出三四十令，最多不过五六十令，现在该厂一号及三号机能日出二百三十令纸，超过解放前水准一倍有余。该厂二号机正计划改装与三号机合并，将出质料较佳的纸。其他永泰、初起、义和、北平等家，每日均可出纸四十令至七十令。综计北平各厂每月现在总产量为一六一五○令，共拥有造纸机十四台，电动机六十六台，共一四六五马力，能出各种制图、片艳、包装、牛皮、书皮等纸。成品行销本市、张家口、保定、天津等地，供不应求。因此各厂均产量日增，营业发达。私营纸厂亦均有增资及扩充设备的计划，对前途抱乐观态度。
    　　　　原料困难亟须解决
    【又讯】北平造纸工业目前的最大问题，是原料不足。在战前及敌伪期间，即仰赖日本及东北供给纸浆。日本投降后，纸浆来源困难，即改用废纸。目前本市六家纸厂除大信一家系用存留的伪币为原料外，其余五家均仰赖本市废纸料的供给。据一般估计，北平每日能出废纸五千斤；但五家纸厂的需要量每日为二万二千斤。各厂产量如有增加，所需废纸更多。因此各厂均认为原料困难是纸业发展的最大障碍。此外，华北及东北的纸浆工厂均在幼稚阶段，天津造纸公司所制纸浆尚不足自己消费。东北的纸浆厂亦供不上造纸厂的需要。锦州规模较大的纸浆工厂遭国民党匪军破坏。因此，北平造纸业欲求发展，就只有仰赖自己添置纸浆工厂。但创办纸浆工厂需要添置蒸罐、蒸发器、转炉、溶碱器、打浆机、漂浆机。这些机器都需要按照造纸机的性能，自己设计，自己铸造。这绝不是一个工厂自己的力量所能做到的。因此，一方面需要人民投资，一方面需要政府帮助，以合力完成纸浆工厂的建立。
