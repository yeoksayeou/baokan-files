　　Outside Beiping City
    Mu Shen
    The peasants of the North China Liberated Area are supporting Beiping and Tianjin with amazing strength. These two cities, encompassing more than four million people, have been liberated for nearly two months, and the supply of materials has always been ample and abundant, with grain, vegetables, and meat flowing into Pingjin from the suburbs. In mid-December of last year, I took a car north from Shijiazhuang, passing through Gaocheng, around Hejian, through Baoding, and along the Pingbao Line to Zhuozhou. Along the way, I encountered countless cart convoys, the lines of carts stretching endlessly. Often, the head of the convoy had already disappeared into the eastern horizon of the distant wilderness, while its tail was still slowly swaying on the western side of the wilderness. The rumble of cartwheels, the shouts of cart drivers, and the long neighs of livestock stirred the entire wilderness into a roaring clamor. Carts from Guan arrived in Gaoyang, carts from Hengshui arrived in Baoding... The peasants traveled hundreds of miles, delivering the grain they had harvested with their own hands to the north. At that time, the People's Liberation Army had already surrounded Pingjin, and the soldiers and the workers and citizens about to be liberated were all waiting for the peasants' grain.
    In such times, it is easiest to recognize the power of the masses. Tens of millions of catties of grain were quickly transported to designated locations by manpower and animal power. In such times, it is also easiest to recognize the loyalty of the peasants. For the liberation of themselves and others, they are not stingy with anything they own.
    Why is this? What power makes them so diligent and active? During a trip in mid-January of this year, I found the answer to this question.
    That day was January 17th. We departed from Tong County at dusk, heading to Qinglong Bridge in the western suburbs of Beiping. We only had one car, with a total of five people including the driver. The car always followed a small road about ten miles outside Beiping City. None of us knew the way. In the first half of the night, there were constantly people on the road, the artillery, infantry, and messengers of the People's Liberation Army hastily moving east and west; peasants' carts loaded with grain, firewood, and scaling ladders traveled back and forth. There were still nearly 200,000 enemies inside the city, and the People's Liberation Army and the peasants were making preparations to attack the city. Thanks to these lovely people, we didn't go the wrong way.
    In the second half of the night, there were almost no people on the road. The North Star became our only guide. We found a small highway and slowly advanced westward along it. Near a small village, suddenly a person ran out of the village, shouting as he ran. The car stopped abruptly, and we instinctively drew our guns.
    This person appeared to be in his fifties and hurriedly said: "Comrades! The road ahead is impassable, the bridge has been destroyed by the Kuomintang. The road is narrow, and the car can't back up. Let me lead you around!"
    He was out of breath. By the light of the flashlight, we saw his face full of sincerity and assumed he had no malice, so we immediately invited him into the car. At this time, the north wind was very strong, and we were shivering even in our leather coats, but this farmer, named Chen Chunfu, was only wearing a cotton coat.
    One of our comrades lent Old Chen a leather overcoat and offered him a cigarette to smoke. He slowly stopped panting and gradually calmed down.
    At this time, he said: "I was already lying down, but when I heard the sound of a car, I put on my clothes and hurried after you, otherwise, you would have gone to the bridge and that would have been a big problem." He said: Ahead is a depression, only one car can pass at a time. There is a bridge in the middle. The bridge was destroyed by the Kuomintang army. A few days ago, our car didn't know and drove all the way to the bridge, unable to turn around and very difficult to back up, often taking half a day to get back on the right road. Today he heard the sound of a car and automatically ran out to lead the way.
    "Our army is different from the Kuomintang, they don't conscript soldiers or beat people, so I dare to lead the way. The army is good to the people, and the people can't mistreat the army. Like the Kuomintang, conscripting soldiers, robbing things, beating and scolding people, the people run away as soon as they see them. They bully people, so people don't help them, and they are not convenient."
    I was very interested in these words of Old Chen. He simply and honestly stated the relationship between our army and the people and the Kuomintang, although it was not yet complete. So, I curiously further inquired about his background.
    He had been farming for generations, and his family was extremely poor. He now has five family members, besides him and his old wife, there are two daughters nearly twenty years old and a son fifteen or sixteen years old. The whole family only has two small rooms and five mu of poor land. He can weld tin kettles, and when he is not busy with farming, he goes to the Jizhong area to work as a craftsman to make up for his poor life.
    He narrated his experience at length and without fear of being tedious. Suddenly, he changed the subject and asked: "Comrade, when will we have land reform here!"
    "Do you know about land reform?" One of our comrades in the car said excitedly: "Tell us, what is it all about!"
    "I know, I welded tin kettles in Anping, I saw land reform, I know everything. I have inquired about the situation in our village."
    Then, he began to analyze. Who is a landlord, who should be divided. Who is a rich peasant, who should be kept. Who is a middle peasant, who should not be struggled against...
    "According to the situation in our village, people like me can get three mu of land per person. Three times five is fifteen, I can get ten mu. In our village, the big landlord has so many houses, I can probably get two rooms. My daughters are already grown up, it's really inconvenient to squeeze them into my two small rooms. If I get two rooms, they can live in them. My son is grown up, I can marry him a wife in the new house, wouldn't that be like a family!"
    Old Chen said again and again: "Like me, I have been looking forward to you coming, so we can have land reform! There are many families like mine – our future will be good!"
    Old Chen became the center of our car, and the driver slowed down, constantly turning his head to interject a word or two. After driving for about a dozen miles, we turned back to that small highway and reached the west side of the destroyed bridge. The bridge was made of stone, with a total of four arches, half of which had been destroyed by the bombing. Old Chen told us to stop the car. He said: "This is the bridge. They can't beat us, so they destroyed such a good bridge." He said: "The road ahead is easy to travel. I'm going back now. The superiors have given orders that we will start work tomorrow, and in three to five days, when you come back, it will probably be repaired."
    We all got out of the car and shook hands with him tightly, and he didn't know what to do for a moment. He just said: "The road ahead is easy to travel. It's best not to keep the lights on in your car, the Kuomintang in the city often shoot at our cars..." Speaking of this, he changed the subject and asked: "Is Beiping coming soon! It would be good to take this place down sooner!"
    We told him: "Soon, soon, Beiping will soon belong to our people. After the liberated area has a big city, things will be easier." He nodded and smiled, and parted ways with us. This peasant from the newly liberated area has temporarily parted ways with us. However, he became the topic of our journey, and his words and his enthusiasm are still deeply imprinted in our hearts.

　　在北平城外
    木深
    华北解放区的农民们，用惊人的力量支援北平和天津。这两个包括四百多万人口的城市，解放迄今将近两月，物资供应始终是充沛而丰裕的，粮食、蔬菜和肉类，从四郊源源流入平津。去年十二月中旬，我从石家庄乘车北上，经藁城，绕河间，走保定，沿平保线到涿州，途中遇到无数的大车群，大车的行列一望无际，往往它的脑袋已经隐没在遥远的原野的东方，它的尾巴还在原野西边慢慢摆动。车轮辚辚声，车夫吆喊声，牲口长嘶声，把整个原野搅扰得一片轰鸣。固安的大车到了高阳，衡水的大车到了保定………，农民们跋涉几百里，把自己亲手收获的粮食送到北方。那时候，人民解放军已经包围了平津，战士们和即将获得解放的工人、市民们，都在等待着农民的粮食。
    在这种时候，最易使人认识群众的力量。几千万斤粮食，靠着人力和畜力迅速地运到指定的地点，在这种时候，也最易使人认识到农民的忠诚，为了解放自己和别人，他们对自己的一切，都是毫不吝惜的。
    这是为什么呢？什么力量使他们这么勤谨和积极？在今年一月中旬的一次旅行中，我找到了这个问题的答案。
    那天是一月十七日，黄昏从通县出发，赴平西郊青龙桥。我们只有一辆汽车，连司机共五个人。汽车始终沿着北平城外十余里的小路走。我们都不认识路。在前半夜，路上不断有人，解放军的炮兵、步兵、传令兵急匆匆的东西调动；农民们装载粮食、柴草、云梯的大车来往穿行。城内还有近二十万的敌人，解放军和农民们正作着攻城的准备。靠着这些可爱的人们，我们没有走错路。
    到下半夜，路上几乎没有人了。北极星成了我们唯一的向导。我们找到了一条小公路，沿着它缓缓的向西前进。走到一个小村落附近，突然，从村里跑出一个人来，一面飞跑，一面大叫。汽车戛然停止，我们本能的拔出手枪。
    这个人看来有五十多岁，急急忙忙的说：“同志！前面走不通了，桥叫国民党破坏了。路狭，汽车退不回来，我领你们绕个路吧！”
    他气喘嘘嘘，借着手电灯光，看见他满脸忠诚，料想没有什么恶意，我们就立时把他请上车来。这时北风很紧，我们穿着皮衣还冷得发抖，这位叫做陈春福的农民，却只穿着一件棉衣。
    我们一个同志借给老陈一件皮大衣，并且送他一支纸烟抽。他慢慢停止了喘息，逐渐安静下来了。
    这时，他说：“我早躺下了，听见汽车一响，披上衣裳就赶你们，要不，你们走向桥上去那就要费大事了。”他说：前面是一条洼道，只能走一辆汽车。中间有一座桥。桥被国民党军破坏了。前几天我们的汽车不知道，一直跑到桥边，既不能回头，又很难打倒车，常常费半天工夫，才能转到正路上。今天他听见汽车一响，就自动跑来带路了。
    “咱们的军队和国民党不一样，一不抓兵，二不打人，我就敢来带路。军队对老百姓好，老百姓就不能错待军队。象国民党，抓兵，抢东西，打人骂人，老百姓看见它的影子就跑光了。他欺侮人，人就不帮助他，他就不方便。”
    我对老陈这几句话感到极大的兴趣。他简单而纯朴的说出了我们和国民党的军民关系，虽然还并不很完全。于是，我好奇地进一步访问了他的身世。
    他几代务农，家中极苦。现有五口人，除他与老妻外，还有两个年近二十的女儿，一个十五六岁的儿子。全家只有两间小房，五亩薄地。他会焊洋铁壶，农闲时就到冀中一带耍手艺，弥补这穷苦的日子。
    他长长地、不惮烦琐地叙述自己的经历。突然，他变换了话题，问道：“同志，咱们这里什么时候土地改革呀！”
    “你知道土地改革么？”我们同车的一个同志很兴奋的说：“你说说，那是怎么回事！”
    “我知道，我在安平焊洋铁壶，我看过土地改革，我什么都知道。我们村里的情形我都打听好了。”
    接着，他就分析起来。谁是地主，该分。谁是富农，该留。谁是中农，不该斗……
    “照我们村里的情形，象我这种人，一人总能合三亩地。三五一十五，我还能分十亩。我们村里，大地主房子真多，我大约总能分两间。闺女已经大了，挤在我那两间小房子里真不方便。分两间房子，可以给她们住。儿子大了，给他在新房里娶个媳妇，不也就象一家人家！”
    老陈再三说：“象我，早就盼着你们过来，好土地改革呀！象我这样的人家多着哩——咱们以后的日子就好了！”
    老陈成了我们这辆汽车的中心，司机也放缓速度，不断回过头来插一两句话。约摸走了十几里路，又弯回那道小公路上，走到被破坏的桥西。桥是石头修的，共有四孔，被炸毁了一半。老陈叫把车子停下，他说：“就是这个桥。他们打不过咱们，把这么一座好桥也破坏了。”他说：“前面就好走了。我这就回去了。上边下了命令，我们明天就动工，再过三、五天，你们要回来，大约就修好了。”
    我们都下车来，和他紧紧的握手，他一时不知如何是好。只是说：“往前就好走了。你们车子上的灯，顶好不要一直亮着，城里国民党看见咱们的车，常常打炮……”说到这里，他转过话头，问道：“北平快啦吧！这地方早点儿拿下来才好！”
    我们告诉他：“快了，快了，北平快成为咱们老百姓的了。以后解放区有了大城，事情就好办了。”他点头笑着，和我们分手。这个新解放区的农民，已经和我们暂时分手了。但是，他成了我们一路的话题，他的话和他那样的热情，到如今还深深的印在我们的心里。
