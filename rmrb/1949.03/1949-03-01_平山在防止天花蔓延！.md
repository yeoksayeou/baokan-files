Since the outbreak of smallpox in Pingshan last winter, it has gradually spread to various places, and is now extremely serious. According to imprecise statistics, more than 100 people have died throughout the county. In Nanwanglou Village in the Second District alone, a current survey shows that out of 440 households with a population of 1,651, 83 people have contracted the disease.

Not only are children susceptible to this disease, but adults are as well. This has a great impact on production and the health of the people of the entire county. The North China Government's Ministry of Health has organized a medical team of more than 40 people to go to Pingshan to carry out epidemic prevention and treatment. With the assistance and guidance of the team, in order to rescue lives in an organized and planned manner, a joint meeting of responsible comrades from various departments and the medical team was held on the morning of the 18th of this month. They unanimously agreed to establish a county Epidemic Prevention and Health Committee. The first committee meeting was held on the evening of the 18th of this month, and the following urgent measures were decided:

(1) Investigate the prevalence of the epidemic and carry out focused treatment.

(2) Take the Second District of this county as the focus, learn from experience, and promote it throughout the county.

(3) Convene a meeting of civil affairs assistants and doctor representatives from various districts on the 23rd of this month to deploy epidemic prevention methods and free vaccination. Each district will organize doctors to go to the villages to treat (bring smallpox vaccine to the lower levels and vaccinate for free).

(4) Use the county's primary schools, complete primary schools, and normal schools as the backbone to carry out universal publicity. Schools will add epidemic prevention courses (materials will be provided by the medical team, mainly on prevention methods).

In addition, the county government also issued five instructions to districts and villages on February 20th:

(1) All children and adults must be vaccinated against smallpox.

(2) Implement isolation. Patients should not go out casually. Patients' belongings and furniture should not be used by healthy people. When scabs fall off, do not approach healthy people.

(3) The patient's room should be sprinkled with water frequently. The ashes and scabs swept from the room should be buried or burned and not dumped randomly.

(4) Patients should not spit mucus and phlegm indiscriminately. The room should be kept clean.

(5) It is best for the elderly to take care of patients, because the elderly are immune and have strong resistance, but they are not allowed to wander around and approach people.

During the epidemic prevention campaign, the epidemic prevention medical team of the North China People's Government's Ministry of Health performed a快板剧 (Kuaiban musical theatre) in Donghuishe, Pingshan County on February 20th to publicize vaccination against smallpox. They started by singing a "Turn Over" small tune, which attracted 70 or 80 spectators. As soon as the Kuaiban began, someone in the crowd quietly pointed to the actor playing the pockmarked face and whispered, "Look! That woman has a face full of bumps and is blind. How uncomfortable!" At that time, a young woman squeezed in and asked the team leader, "Where is the place to get the bumps planted?" The team leader told her that it was in the house with the red cross flag on the street. After hearing this, she didn't even bother to finish the show and ran to get vaccinated. After this publicity, five people went to get vaccinated on the spot. They performed in five places at this market. When the performance was over, a worried old man squeezed to the front and asked to have his toothache treated. He said, "You said in the play just now that you can give acupuncture and treat headaches and toothaches. My toothache is terrible now, please give me some acupuncture!" The actors gave him acupuncture without even taking off their costumes. The pain stopped as soon as he was treated, and he left happily. After this publicity, more people came to get vaccinated. Before the makeup publicity, only 25 people were vaccinated, but after the publicity, 86 people were vaccinated.

　　平山在防止天花蔓延！
    平山自去冬天花流行以来，逐渐蔓延各地，至今异常严重。据不精确统计，全县已死亡达一百人以上，只二区南望楼一村，目前调查结果全村四百四十户，人口一千六百五十一人其中得此病者即达八十三人。
    不仅小孩容易发生和传染此病，大人也是同样。这对生产和全县人民的健康有着极大的影响。华北政府卫生部为防止天花流行，已组织了四十余人的医疗大队，赴平山进行防疫治疗。在大队的协助与指导下，为了有组织有计划的救护人命，在本月十八号上午召开了各部门及医疗大队负责同志的联合会议，一致同意成立县防疫卫生委员会，本月十八日晚，已召开了第一次委员会，决定当前紧急措施如下：
    （一）调查疫病流行情况，进行有重点的医治。
    （二）以本县二区作为重点，吸取经验，推广全县。
    （三）本月二十三日召开各区民政助理员及医生代表会议，布置防疫办法和免费种痘。由各区组织医生分头到村医治（带痘苗下级，免费点种）。
    （四）以本县小学、完小、师范做骨干进行普遍宣传，学校添讲防疫课程（材料由医疗队供给，主要讲预防办法）。
    此外县府也于二月二十日向区村发出五项指示：
    （一）无论小孩、大人都要点种牛痘。
    （二）实行隔离，病人不要随便外出；病人使的东西家具，好人不使；脱落痂皮时，不要与好人接近。
    （三）病人室内要经常洒水；室内扫除的灰土痂皮，要埋掉，或用火烧，不可乱倒。
    （四）病人鼻涕及痰不要乱吐；室内要常清洁。
    （五）照护病人最好是老人，因老人免疫，且抵抗力强，但不准乱串门子接近人。
    在防疫运动中，华北人民政府卫生部的防疫医疗队，二月二十日在平山县东回舍他们还演出了一个快板剧宣传种牛痘预防天花。他们开始唱翻身小调，一唱就招来了七八十个观众。快板剧刚开始，群众里面就有人悄悄指着扮麻脸的演员低声说：“看！那个妇女生了一脸疙瘩，还瞎了眼睛，多难受呀！”当时就有一个青年妇女挤来问领队的同志：种疙瘩的地方在那里？领队同志告诉她街上插有红十字旗的房子里便是，她听了连戏也顾不上看完，便跑去种痘去了。经过这样宣传，当场便去种痘的有五个人，在这集上他们共演了五个地方，演完散场时，又有一个愁眉苦脸的老汉挤到前面来，要求给他治牙痛，他说：“刚才你们演戏说会扎针，能治头痛、牙痛，我现在正牙痛得厉害，你们给我扎一下吧！”当时演员没有卸装就扎起针来了。一扎就止了痛，他欢天喜地的走了。这次宣传以后，来种痘的人就多了，化装宣传以前只种了二十五个人，宣传后就种了八十六个。
