　　Song of the Power Plant Workers
    (By Li Yitian, worker of the Operation Section, Shijingshan Power Plant)
    Generate more electricity, generate more electricity, we are all strong workers,
    You haul ash, I haul coal, let's all work hard together.
    You clean the furnace, I add coal, united and not lazy.
    The furnace fire is red, the machine wheels are turning, working together to keep the power on.
    Produce more, generate more electricity, and Beijing will never be dark again.
    Raise opinions about difficulties, discuss criticism and offer advice.
    Everyone's business, everyone does it, working hard to produce and support the front lines.
    We are the masters, we are the strong workers of the power plant.

　　电厂工人歌
    （石景山发电厂运行股工友李宜田）
    多发电，多发电，我们都是工人汉，
    你运灰，我运炭，大家一齐努力干。
    你清炉，我添炭，团结一致不怠慢。
    炉火红，机轮转，同心协力不停电。
    多生产，多发电，北平从此不黑暗。
    困难事，提意见，讨论批评与解劝。
    大家事，大家干，努力生产支援前线。
    我们是主人翁，我们是电厂工人汉。
