　　The People's Government Protects Women's Rights
    Resolute Struggle is the Way Out!
    ——Answering Ms. Huang Piao's Questions

To the Editor:
    I am a twenty-year-old girl, born into a feudal family. I only attended elementary school for three years before my parents stopped me from going. Alas! My environment is terrible. I don't dare ask my parents for money because they favor boys over girls and simply don't allow me to go out. They believe that a girl should never leave the house. My fate is so miserable! In action, education, thought, and marriage, I have absolutely no freedom. In the past, my mind was simple, and I became accustomed to the pain. At the same time, I didn't understand what human happiness was.

    Before the People's Liberation Army entered the city, a friend of my uncle often brought books for my uncle to read. Out of curiosity, I stole one when my uncle wasn't home and read it in the toilet. Because my education was too shallow, I didn't recognize many characters, but it was in vernacular Chinese, so I resolved to understand it. Every day in the toilet, I used a scrap of paper and a broken pencil to write down all the unfamiliar characters and then looked them up in the dictionary in my uncle's room. After more than forty days, I finally understood the book. But my pain came with it. Why? Because the book told me what life is, what life is for, how people should live, what true happiness is, what freedom is… After reading all this, alas! I am not as free as a parasite! …Until now, I have secretly read no less than thirty books. I admire the great cause undertaken by the revolutionary martyrs, and I want to join the revolution and become a female soldier, but I never have the opportunity. Although Peiping has been liberated, I am not yet liberated!

    The other day, someone came to investigate women, registering everyone over the age of fifteen because a women's congress would be held soon. How happy I was! I thought this was a great opportunity. I thought of going to the courtyard, but my mother stopped me. Later, she told me, "I didn't register you." Hearing this, my heart sank. I imagine there are many people like me. I hope the People's Government will conduct another detailed investigation! This will save many women like me.

    Editor: My marriage was arranged entirely by my parents. At that time, I didn't understand the harm in it, so I didn't resist. We haven't met once or exchanged letters. I am supposed to get married this year. My marriage is entirely forced by my parents. I absolutely cannot resist this pressure in my family and this marriage with my own strength. Now I kneel here begging you to help me! Editor: Does the People's Court guarantee us youth freedom of marriage? Does the People's Court accept lawsuits from men and women seeking to dissolve their marriages? What are the procedures, and are there court fees? I am not financially independent right now. What if my parents drive me out of the family after the dissolution? Can the People's Government give me a way out? I await your reply, or I will not be able to live. This feudal rope will strangle me to death.

Ms. Huang Piao:
    We received your letter. We sympathize with you for being bound by a feudal family and persecuted by a dark society. Now we can tell you that the days of liberation are already before you; it only depends on whether you have the determination to fight for it! It is wrong for your parents to force you into marriage and ruin your lifelong happiness. It is reasonable for you to file a complaint. The People's Government will accept your complaint and protect your freedom of marriage and other freedoms according to law, not allowing others (including your parents) to interfere. At the same time, the People's Government is definitely not the old government of the Kuomintang. It does not require you to pay litigation fees. As for your fear that your parents will drive you out of the family, this is also not allowed by the People's Government.

### 人民政府保障妇女权利  坚决斗争就有出路！——答黄飘女士问

　　人民政府保障妇女权利
    坚决斗争就有出路！
    ——答黄飘女士问编辑先生：
    我是个二十岁的女孩子，生在一个封建的家庭，小学我只上了三年，父母就不叫我念了。唉！我的环境太恶劣了，没有钱不敢向父母要，因为父母重男轻女，根本就不叫我出门，他们认为姑娘家，就该大门不出二门不迈。我的命运够多么惨呢？行动，教育，思想，婚姻，我的一切，根本没有自由。从前我的脑子简单，痛苦也成了习惯。同时，也不明白什么是人类的幸福。
    解放军未进城的时候，我叔叔有个朋友，时常拿来书叫我叔看，当时因我好奇心，等我叔不在家时我偷了一本，到厕所去看了，因我的学问太浅，有很多字不认识，不过倒是白话，于是我立志把他看懂，我每天在厕所，拿一张破纸，一个破铅笔头，把所有生字记下来，再到我叔屋里查字典，就这样经过四十多天的工夫，我就把这本书看懂了。可是我的痛苦也就随着而来了，为什么呢？因为书里告诉了我，人生是怎样一回事，人生是为了什么，人是应该怎样活着，什么是真快乐，什么是自由……根据这一些一看，唉！我还不如一个寄生虫自由呢？……直到现在，我偷着看了不下三十本书，我钦佩革命先烈所做出的那一番伟大事业，我很想参加革命，当一个女战士，可是总没有机会。虽然北平已经解放了，可是我还没解放呢！
    前两天有人来调查妇女，十五岁以上的都要登记，因为不久即要开妇女会，我是多么的高兴呵！我想这可是个顶好的机会了。我想到院子里去，当时被母亲拦住了，后来她对我说：“没给你登记”，听了这话，当时我的心都凉了。我想象我这样的人，一定是不少的，希望人民政府再作一次详细调查吧！这样是会救出很多象我这样的妇女的。
    编辑先生：我的婚姻是父母一手包办的，那时我不明白其中害处，所以也不反抗，至今我们没见过一次面，也没通过信，今年就要结婚了。我的婚姻，完全是由父母强迫包办的，我这个家庭，这个婚姻，凭我自己的力量是绝对抵挡不住这种压力的。现在我跪在这儿求求你们帮助拉我一把吧！编辑先生：人民法院给我们青年婚姻自由的保障吗？人民法院是否受理男女解除婚姻的控诉，经什么手续，需要诉费吗？现在我个人经济未独立，解约之后，父母把我驱逐家庭怎么办？人民政府能否给我一条生路，我敬待您的答复，不然我是活不了的，封建这根绳子就把我勒死了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　黄飘
    黄飘女士：你的来信收到，你受封建家庭的束缚，及黑暗社会的迫害，我们对你抱十分同情。现在可以告诉你，解放的日子已经呈现在你面前，只看你是否有决心争取！你父母强迫你结婚，葬送了你终身的幸福，是不对的，你提出申诉是合理的。人民政府是会接受你的申诉，并依法保护你的婚姻等各种自由，不容旁人（父母在内）干涉。同时人民政府决不是国民党的旧政府，他是不用你化诉讼费的。至于你说怕父母将你驱逐出家庭，这也是人民政权所不容许的。
