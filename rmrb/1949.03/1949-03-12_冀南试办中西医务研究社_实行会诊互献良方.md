Jinan Trial Establishment of Chinese and Western Medical Research Society
　　Implementing Consultations and Mutual Contribution of Effective Prescriptions
　　[Jinan Electric] The Jinan Administrative Office's trial establishment of a Chinese and Western Medical Research Society has yielded initial results, providing concrete methods for how Chinese and Western doctors can learn from each other and serve the people together. This society was formed in July of last year by a group of Chinese and Western doctors who voluntarily requested to improve their skills, under the Civil Affairs Department of the Jinan Administrative Office. Over the past seven months, the erroneous ideas of mutual disdain between Chinese and Western doctors have been overcome, turning into mutual learning. Diseases that Chinese medicine cannot cure can be learned from Western medicine. For example, Chinese medicine's treatment of pneumonia by taking herbal medicine is ineffective, while an injection of penicillin can cure it. In cases of children suffering from collapse, an injection of a cardiac stimulant can be quickly effective. Currently, four or five Chinese medicine practitioners have learned injections. In normal diagnoses, when encountering difficult-to-treat diseases, consultations are invited, and mutual research is conducted in plenary meetings. Under this influence, many Chinese and Western doctors have joined the society, which currently has twenty members. Members further encourage each other to establish a spirit of serving the people and being responsible to patients. When the masses come to ask about illnesses and a response cannot be provided, a letter is sent after research. Common diseases and their prevention methods are published in the "Worker, Peasant, and Soldier" bi-monthly magazine. To express their determination to change, Zhao Yaodong is determined to discard outdated and ineffective medicines. Recently, the society has also requested the government that, in the event of an epidemic, they will voluntarily go to the countryside to serve without any remuneration. To better run the research society, the following preparations are being made: (1) Research should be linked to practice. Each time they meet, they should report on their personal work situation in order to absorb good experiences and correct erroneous medical methods. (2) Chinese and Western doctors should contribute secret prescriptions to each other, overcoming conservatism, with the understanding that contributing one's own allows for the exchange of everyone's twenty. At the same time, the benefits of improvement can be obtained through research. (3) Anti-superstition propaganda is conducted through the treatment of diseases.

　　冀南试办中西医务研究社
  　实行会诊互献良方
    【冀南电】冀南行署试办中西医学研究社，得到初步成绩。对中西医生如何互相学习，共同为人民大众服务，提供了具体的办法。该社为冀南行署民政处于去年七月间由一部分中西医生自动要求提高技术而组成的。七个月来，克服了中西医生互相轻视的错误思想而转为互相学习。中医无法医治的病可向西医学习，如中医医治肺炎，吃草药不顶事，而注射了潘尼西林即可痊愈。遇有患虚脱症的小孩，注射强心针可迅速见效。刻已有四、五个中医学会注射。在平时诊断中，如遇有难治病症，即邀请别人会诊，并在全体会上互相研究。在此影响下，许多中西医生纷纷加入该社。现有社员二十人。并进一步互勉树立为人民服务及对病人负责到底的精神。群众来问病时，不能回答时，经研究后寄信回复。普遍性病症在“工农兵”半月刊上登载防治方法。为表示自己转变的决心，赵耀东决心把过时无效的药品丢掉。最近该社并向政府请求，如发生流行病，自愿下乡服务，不取任何报酬。为了更办好研究社，今后准备：（一）研究要联系实际，每次碰头时均要报告个人工作情况，以便吸取好的经验，纠正错误的医疗方法。（二）中西医生互献秘方，克服保守性，大家都明了自己献一个，就能换回大家的二十个。同时经研究后又能得到改进的好处。（三）通过治病进行反迷信宣传。
