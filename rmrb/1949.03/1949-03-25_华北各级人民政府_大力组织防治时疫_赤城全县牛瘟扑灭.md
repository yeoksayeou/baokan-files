　　North China Governments at All Levels
    Vigorously Organize the Prevention and Treatment of Epidemics
    Rinderpest Eradicated in Chicheng County
    [This newspaper reports] The spirit of the North China Regional Health Work Conference this spring, which focused on epidemic prevention, is being implemented in the work of governments at all levels in North China. Ji Zhong, Ji Nan, and other regions have convened health work conferences to determine specific measures for carrying out health work and protecting the people's health. Ji Zhong, Ji Lu Yu, and other regions are providing free vaccinations to the masses. According to recent reports, epidemics have been discovered in Xingtai, Xiyang, Bo’ai and other counties and cities in the Taihang area, and local governments are providing emergency assistance. Since the beginning of spring, epidemics have been prevalent in Chahar Province, with 45 people in Baoyuan Chang Tie Lu Village dying from smallpox. In Laishui, 547 people have fallen ill. Smallpox has also been successively discovered in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Yanqing, Huailai, Changping, Nankou and other places. In order to promptly eliminate the epidemic, the Chahar Provincial Government has issued a notice to its subordinate counties and city governments, ordering them to immediately carry out mass epidemic prevention work, requiring universal vaccination of children under the age of 13, and providing free cholera and typhoid vaccinations in urban areas and densely populated areas. It also ordered health and epidemic prevention committees above the county level to organize Chinese and Western doctors, in coordination with political and civilian cadres, to implement epidemic prevention in depth. In areas where doctors are lacking, the method of apprenticeship is adopted, or some students and cadres are temporarily mobilized and given short-term simple training to participate in epidemic prevention and vaccination work. The North China People's Government also specially organized an epidemic prevention team, which rushed to the Chicheng area on the 16th of this month to inspect and provide treatment, while another team patrolled the Pingshan area to carry out vaccinations, epidemic prevention, and organize Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to participate in this work. The Health Department of the North China People's Government has also issued a circular, requiring all localities to be vigilant against epidemics, and to report to higher-level health authorities immediately upon discovery in order to assist in prevention and treatment. It is also stipulated that isolation should be implemented immediately after the discovery of infectious diseases, and if the situation is serious, traffic should be cut off to prevent the spread.
