【Taihang Telegram】Encouraged by the victorious situation nationwide, the enthusiasm of Lingchuan laborers to support the front lines is extremely high. After receiving the district's notification on the 17th of last month to support the front lines in northern Henan, everyone rushed to the district to report, working through the night. Some people were on their way to the market when they heard the district's notification for stretcher teams to depart, so they ran from halfway to the district to report. Others were carrying coal, and they left the coal halfway to rush back and catch up with the team. Some even volunteered to carry stretchers. Militia member Ge Xiaogou, who had just returned home after participating in the war at the front for a month, volunteered to follow the stretcher team upon hearing the call. The masses said to him, "You just came back, you shouldn't go this time." He said, "I don't need to participate in many more battles. This time I want to carry a stretcher and make contributions." Dong Zhaolin excitedly said, "I didn't get a chance to participate in the battles of Jiaozuo and Xiuwu several times. Are you looking down on me? This time I want to win glory for everyone." During the march, everyone's morale was exceptionally high, and the spirit of mutual assistance was excellent, with no one falling behind. One day they walked one hundred and ten li, and the sweat on their heads flowed straight down, soaking their cotton clothes. Some had blisters on their feet, but they paid no attention to them. Everyone put forward the slogan: "We will not go home until we take down ××." On the night of the 24th, when they encountered the enemy, the laborers directly engaged in a heroic struggle with the enemy. Xu Xiulin, a squad leader from the First Company, fought with four enemies, twice attempting to seize their guns. Because he was outnumbered, he was knocked on the head by an enemy with a hand grenade and fell unconscious. After regaining consciousness, he broke through the encirclement alone. Comrades Gao Sanhu and Shi Baofu, the cooks, threw away their quilts and carried the pot through the hail of bullets to break through the enemy's encirclement. They said, "It doesn't matter if our own things are lost, but if we lose the pot, everyone will have nothing to eat."

　　坚决消灭豫北残匪
  　陵川民工争先支前
    【太行电】陵川民工在全国胜利形势鼓舞下，支援前线热情甚为高涨。上月十七日接到区上支援豫北前线通知后，大家都在星夜赶往区上报到，有的人赶集走到半路上，听说区上通知担架出发，半路就跑到区上来报到，还有的在担煤，把煤放在半路跑回追赶队伍，有的自动报名来抬担架。民兵葛小狗，在前方参战一月刚到家不久，这次听到出担架，便自报要求跟担架出发。群众对他说：“你刚回来，这次不该你去。”他说：“参战也用不着多少回了，这次我要去抬担架立功。”董兆林兴奋的说：“打焦作、修武几次没有轮到我，是不是看不起我，这次要给大家争光。”行军中，大家情绪异常高涨，互助精神很好，无一掉队的。有一天走了一百一十里，头上的大汗直流下来，棉衣被汗浸湿，有的脚上打了泡，都不去理会。大家都提出：“不打下××不回家”的口号。二十四日夜与敌遭遇时，民工们与敌直接展开了英勇的搏斗，一连三排许修林与四个敌人撕杀，两次与敌夺枪，因寡不敌众，被敌人用手榴弹敲破头，昏倒在地，清醒后，单身突出包围。伙夫同志高三虎、史保富二人，把自己的被子扔了，背着锅从枪林弹雨中冲出了敌人的包围，他们说：“自己的东西丢了不要紧，丢了锅，大家就无法吃饭。”
