　　Old Drama Circles in Peiping Gather to Discuss Old Drama Reform Work

　　[Our Newspaper] The Peiping Military Control Commission's Cultural Takeover Committee convened a meeting of colleagues in the old drama circles of Peiping yesterday (the 26th) at the Chang'an Grand Theater to discuss how to launch the work of old drama reform. More than 450 members of the National Opera Association and Pingju Opera Association attended. Representatives of the Cultural Management Committee, Ma Yanxiang, and renowned dramatists Tian Han and Hong Shen attended and spoke. In his speech, Ma Yanxiang pointed out that old Peiping opera was a tool used by past rulers to numb and deceive the people. In the future new democratic society, old dramas must be reformed. The first step is to review the existing old drama programs, then modify them based on the old scripts, and at the same time create new scripts so that the content meets the needs of the people in the new society. Peiping is the birthplace of old Peiping opera and the concentration of actors. Doing a good job in the reform of old Peiping opera in Peiping will play a leading exemplary role in the country. Tian Han pointed out that in the past, old drama workers mostly served feudal landlords, bureaucrats, and imperialists, but today they are serving the people themselves. Drama workers must respect themselves and be teachers of society. He hoped that everyone would raise their awareness and strengthen their unity. Hong Shen talked about the content of several old dramas, such as "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Huang Tianba," explaining their harmful parts. He pointed out that today's government is the people's government, and it is also the old drama circles' own government. The old drama circles must trust the people's government, trust their own strength, and actively engage in old drama improvement. The famous actor Cheng Yanqiu represented the old drama circles in expressing acceptance of the opinions of the Cultural Management Committee and Mr. Ma, Tian, and Hong, and expressed his gratitude.

　　平旧剧界集会
    商讨旧剧改革工作
    【本报讯】北平军管会文化接管委员会于昨（二十六）日在长安大戏院召集北平旧剧界同人，讨论如何展开旧剧改革工作。到有国剧公会及评剧公会会员四百五十余人，由文管会代表马彦祥及著名之戏剧家田汉、洪深出席讲话。马彦祥讲话时指出：旧平剧是过去统治者用来麻醉人民、欺骗人民的工具；在今后新民主主义社会里，旧剧必须加以改革。第一步是审查现有旧剧节目，然后在旧剧本基础上进行修改，同时创作新的剧本，使内容合乎新社会人民的需要。北平是旧平剧发祥地，各演员的集中地。北平的旧平剧改革工作做得好，将在全国起领导的模范的作用。田汉则指出旧剧工作者过去多是伺候封建地主、官僚及帝国主义者，今日则是为人民自己服务了。戏剧工作者要尊重自己，做社会的教师，希望大家提高觉悟，加强团结。洪深谈了几个旧剧的内容，如四郎探母，黄天霸等，说明了它们内容的有害部份。并指出今日的政府是人民的政府，也是旧剧界自己的政府，旧剧界要相信人民政府，相信自己的力量，积极从事旧剧│改良。名演员程砚秋代表旧剧界表示接受文管会及马、田、洪诸先生意见并致谢意。
