　　Specifically Arranging the Work for 1949
　　Jizhong Holds Party Representative Meeting
　　Fully Carries Out Production and Construction to Support the National Liberation War
　　Old Liberated Areas Have Completed Land Reform; Future Focus on Strengthening Production Leadership
　　Strengthening the Party's Unified Leadership to Ensure the Realization of All Plans
　　[Jizhong Electric Telegram] In order to mobilize the entire Jizhong Party to implement the instructions of the North China Central Bureau, and to determine the Jizhong Party's 1949 policy and tasks of fully carrying out production and construction, the Jizhong District Party Committee specially convened the Jizhong Party Representative Meeting on February 12th. This meeting carefully and meticulously stipulated the Jizhong Party's 1949 agricultural production plan, to establish new urban-rural relations, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and continue to support the victory of the National People's Liberation War. The meeting lasted five days and closed on February 16th.

　　A total of 388 official representatives and observers attended the meeting. Including the Jizhong District Party Committee level and the four prefectural committees of the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th districts, and the 55 county and city party committees in Jizhong.

　　After the opening of the conference, Comrade Lin Tie of the Jizhong District Party Committee first conveyed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Bureau on the current situation and tasks. That afternoon, Comrade Lin Tie made a report on Jizhong's 1949 production policy and tasks. In his report, Comrade Lin Tie clearly pointed out: The old liberated areas have completed and ended land reform. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, under the new victorious situation, there are fully favorable conditions to fully engage in production and construction. Therefore, the central task of the Jizhong Party this year is to launch a large-scale production movement with overwhelming force and in a planned way. Then Comrade Lin Tie explained the various policies for developing production: (1) The land property rights of peasants, which have been transformed from feudal land property rights, should be seriously protected. (2) Implement a fair, reasonable, and mutually beneficial burden policy. (3) Vigorously develop cooperatives, establish supply and marketing cooperative organizations from top to bottom, as a bridge closely linking the proletarian-led state economy and small peasant producers. At the same time, production mutual aid should be widely organized based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. (4) Implement policies to reward production and reward labor. (5) Widely mobilize women to participate in field production.

　　On the second day of the conference, Comrade Luo Yuchuan presented a report on Jizhong's 1949 agricultural production plan. He first pointed out: "Due to the severe destruction and devastation of the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang reactionaries over the past ten years, the rural economy in Jizhong has undergone great changes. Now there is a shortage of livestock, a reduction in labor, and rough cultivation. It is estimated that production has generally decreased by about 30% compared to before the war. Therefore, the basic task of rural work in the entire region in 1949 is to lead the people of the entire region to restore and develop agricultural production, and to develop handicrafts and sideline production that cannot be replaced by machines." Comrade Luo Yuchuan emphasized that the so-called increase in grain production is achieved through our strong leadership and subjective efforts, intensive cultivation, increased fertilizer, and improved technology, rather than simply relying on good weather.

　　After the conference report, the meeting entered group discussions. At the beginning of the discussion, a few comrades developed a light enemy and quick victory mentality regarding the current revolutionary situation; some comrades lacked confidence in leading production throughout the year, thereby neglecting the development and needs of the current situation, neglecting the favorable conditions for carrying out the large-scale production movement this year, and even neglecting the leading role of the Party. These issues were initially resolved in the group discussions.

　　The fourth day was a plenary discussion. In their speeches at the conference, representatives put forward many supplementary opinions on issues such as the organization of labor this year, the establishment of cooperatives, the development of water conservancy construction, and how state-owned enterprises can serve agricultural production. Comrade Liu Qingshan, Secretary of the Eighth District Party Committee, proposed: "The entire Party must be mobilized, with the Party as the leadership core, to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to form all labor and semi-labor forces into a labor army and invest them in production." Comrade Zhang Zishan, Secretary of the Tenth District Party Committee, introduced the situation in the vast new areas of the Tianjin-Beijing-Baoding triangle area in his speech, and put forward opinions on the Tenth District's work policy and tasks this year: "Solve the farmers' land demands that can be solved and must be solved, so that farmers can obtain appropriate living and means of production. Mobilize the masses, continue to suppress the remnants of the enemy, establish our various organizations, conscientiously implement policies, and implement reasonable burdens to lay the foundation for this year's production movement." Comrade Xu Suxing of the Eleventh Special Zone emphasized in his speech that balancing labor burdens and not wasting manpower is an important link in increasing production.

　　On February 16th, the last day of the conference, Comrade Lin Tie of the Jizhong District Party Committee made the concluding remarks of the conference. At the beginning of the conclusion, he answered and explained the problems that occurred in the discussion, and further emphasized how to implement the 1949 production policy and tasks.

　　In his summary, Comrade Lin Tie emphasized: "Under the new victorious situation, the vast rural areas of Jizhong must undertake the task of supplying raw materials to the cities, so that production and the needs of the cities are combined. Therefore, there must be new viewpoints and new understandings in leading agricultural production. Because in developing production, we should not accommodate some of the farmers' backward, conservative, and narrow production habits, and the proletariat must realize its leading role over the farmers. Therefore, strengthening labor organization and organizing mutual aid under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit is very important." When talking about the focus of spring production, Comrade Lin Tie pointed out: "We should immediately start organizing manpower and animal power, hauling manure and sending manure, and tidying up the land. In the flood-stricken areas, we must lead the rush planting of barley. There has been a lack of rain in early spring this year, and all areas should dig more earthen wells to prepare for planting to prevent spring drought. In order to prevent insect pests, the land that was cultivated last year and the land that has not been cultivated should be plowed again this spring before sowing." Finally, Comrade Lin Tie called in the conclusion: "In order to complete this year's agricultural production tasks, we must strengthen the Party's unified leadership, we must concentrate our efforts to unify planning, first carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization, ideologically mobilize the entire Jizhong Party and all the people, and resolutely struggle to carry out a large-scale production competition movement and complete the agricultural production of 1949."

　　At the end of the meeting, all unanimously voted to approve the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Bureau, and mobilized the entire Party to complete the task of the large-scale production movement this year.

　　具体布置一九四九年工作
  　冀中召开党代表会
    全力进行生产建设支援全国解放战争
    老区土改已经完成今后加强生产领导
    加强党一元化领导保证全部计划实现
    【冀中电】为了动员冀中全党贯彻华北中央局指示，并确定冀中党一九四九年全力进行生产建设的方针和任务，冀中区党委特于二月十二日召开了冀中党代表会议。此次会议慎重严密地规定了冀中党一九四九年农业生产计划，以建立新的城乡关系，巩固工农联盟，继续支援全国人民解放战争的胜利。会议历时五日，已于二月十六日闭幕。
    出席此次会议正式代表和列席代表共三百八十八人。包括冀中区党委一级和八、九、十、十一等四个地委及全冀中五十五个县市委。
    大会开幕后，首由冀中区党委林铁同志传达了党中央和中央局关于目前形势和任务的指示。当日下午，林铁同志又作了关于冀中一九四九年的生产方针与任务的报告。林铁同志在报告中明确指出：老区已经完成并结束了土地改革。平津解放后在新的胜利形势下，有了充分有利条件全力从事生产建设。因此冀中党今年的中心任务。就是以压倒的力量，有计划地开展大规模的生产运动。接着林铁同志说明了发展生产的各项政策：（一）对由封建土地财产所有权所变成的农民的土地财产所有权，应加以认真的保护。（二）贯彻公平合理公私兼顾的负担政策。（三）以大力发展合作社，自上而下建立供销合作社的组织，作为无产阶级所领导的国家经济和农民小生产者密切联系的桥梁。同时应在自愿两利的原则下，广泛组织生产互助。（四）贯彻奖励生产奖励劳动的政策。（五）广泛发动妇女参加田间生产。
    大会第二天，由罗玉川同志提出冀中一九四九年农业生产计划报告。他首先指出：“由于十余年来敌伪和国民党反动派严重的破坏摧残，冀中的农村经济已起了很大变化。现在牲口缺乏，劳力减少，耕作粗糙，估计产量比战前一般下降百分之三十左右。因此，一九四九年全区农村工作的基本任务，就是领导全区人民恢复与发展农业生产，并开展机器所不能代替的手工业与副业生产。”罗玉川同志着重说明：所谓增产粮食，是经过我们有力的领导和主观努力、精耕细作、增加肥料、改善技术来达到增产，而不能单纯依靠年景好坏。
    大会报告后，进入小组讨论。在讨论开始，有少数同志对目前的革命形势产生轻敌速胜思想；还有些同志对领导生产贯彻全年信心不足，从而忽视目前形势的发展与需要，忽视今年开展大生产运动的有利条件，甚至忽视党的领导作用。这些在各组讨论中，都初步的得到解决。
    第四天举行大会讨论。在大会发言中，代表均就今年劳动力的组织、建立合作社、开展水利建设及城市工作，国营企业如何为农业生产服务等问题，分别提出了许多补充意见。八地委书记刘青山同志提出：“必须全党动员起来，以党为领导核心，发动群众，依靠群众，把全体劳动力和半劳动力组成一支劳动大军，投入到生产中去。”十地委书记张子善同志在发言中，介绍了平津保三角地区广大新区情况后，提出了十分区今年工作方针与任务的意见：“解决可以解决而必须解决的农民土地要求，以使农民获得适当的生活与生产资料。发动群众，继续清剿残敌，树立我之各种组织，认真贯彻政策，实行合理负担，以打下今年生产运动的基础。”十一专区徐素行同志发言中着重提出：平衡人力负担，不浪费人力是增产的重要环节。
    二月十六日，大会最末一天，由冀中区党委林铁同志做了大会的结论。结论开始对讨论中发生的问题，分别做了解答和说明，并进一步着重指出了如何贯彻实现一九四九年的生产方针和任务。
    林铁同志在总结中强调指出：“在新的胜利形势下，冀中广大农村就要担负起供给城市原料的任务，使生产和城市的需要相结合。因此，在领导农业生产上，必须要有新的观点新的认识。因在发展生产中不应迁就农民某些落后、保守、狭隘的生产习惯，无产阶级要对农民实现领导作用。因此，加强劳力组织，在自愿两利原则下组织互助就十分重要。”在谈到春季生产的重点时，林铁同志指出：“应即着手组织人力畜力，拉粪送粪，整理土地。在水灾区就要领导赶种大麦，今年初春缺雨，各地应多挖土井，准备实施点种，防止春旱。为预防虫害，去年已耕和未耕的土地，今春在大播种以前应再耕一遍。”最后林铁同志在结论中号召：“为着完成今年的农业生产任务，必须加强党的一元化领导，必须集中力量统一计划，首先开展广泛深入的宣传动员，从思想上发动冀中全党和全体人民，为开展大规模的生产竞赛运动，完成一九四九年的农业生产而坚决奋斗。”
    会议最后，全体一致表决通过了拥护党中央、中央局的指示，并动员全党完成今年大生产运动任务的决议。
