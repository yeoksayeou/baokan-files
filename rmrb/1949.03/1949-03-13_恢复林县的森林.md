　　Planting a Million Trees
　　Our Lin County has always been a place of lush forests, and Lin County got its name from this. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the occupation and destruction by the enemy and puppet troops, the lush forests were transformed into barren hills and bald ridges. Many prosperous towns and villages were also turned into scorched earth. Since the establishment of the democratic government, the public offices and civilian houses have been planned for reconstruction, but it is difficult to build due to the lack of wood. Seeing this, the government decided to plant one million trees throughout the county during this year's tree-planting season to gradually restore the forests of Lin County. Lin County has a population of more than 400,000. Calculating an average of two and a half trees planted per person, it is not difficult to complete the task.
　　Seven Types of Afforestation Areas
　　Recently, the Cooperation Section and the Farm of the Lin County government have decided to afforest seven types of areas based on the county's topography: 1. Roadside forests - There are two, one is the Shuǐlín Highway from Lin County City East to Ānyáng Shuǐyě Town; the other is the Rènhuī Highway from Rèn Village South to Huī County, planting trees along both sides of the road. A tree is planted every one zhang and five chi away from the side of the road, and the seedlings are prepared and planted by the owner of the land, and the benefits also belong to him. 2. River forests - Lin County has four rivers: Zhāng, Xuān, Hóng, and Xī. The area along the river has sufficient water and is easiest to plant trees. All river tributaries and other dry river beaches and sandy areas must be afforested. 3. Scattered forests - All vacant land in the streets of villages, along the sides of streets, pond banks, roadsides, as well as gaps in courtyards, edges of fields, and corners of houses, etc., must be planted with trees, so that an irregular scattered forest can be cultivated. 4. Bank protection forests - The banks of local rivers and canals often collapse, making cultivation inconvenient. Therefore, trees must be planted to protect the banks and consolidate the canal sides. 5. Scenic forests - After the land reform, every household has land to cultivate. According to the suggestions of the masses, planting a few trees on the graves can not only embellish the scenery but also grow timber. 6. Economic forests - Lin County has many mountains and little land, and everywhere is barren mountain, which can be afforested, especially the Western Mountains, which are red stone mountains. The stone is layered, and it is easier to plant trees and afforest. For example, planting oak trees can both raise silkworms (wild silkworms) and cultivate timber for use as kiln strips and frame wood in coal mines. The oak shells can also be used as dyes. Chinese ash trees can both collect oil extraction and cultivate timber. Other materials, such as Toona sinensis, pagoda tree, willow, elm, paulownia, mulberry, etc., are necessary for repairing houses, building furniture, and other materials. 7. Fruit tree forests - Planting fruit trees is purely a production undertaking, such as persimmon cakes in Jiāo Village, District 10 of Lin County, and the Běishān area, hawthorns in the southwest mountains of Héjiàn in District 2, crabapples, apples, peaches, plums, chestnuts in Wèijiā Village in District 1, red dates in the Dēngōu Hēishān area, pears in Wǔjiāshuǐ in District 12, as well as peppers and walnuts in the area of District 11 and District 12, etc., with huge annual harvests, which greatly subsidize the family economy. However, in recent years, without cultivation and with traffic congestion affecting exports, the annual fruit harvest has plummeted. Now that the entire North China region has been basically liberated, it is appropriate to cultivate them to open up profit sources.
　　Methods of Afforestation and Tree Planting
　　Now that it is tree-planting season, we should quickly organize tree planting. Based on past experience, some people do not know how to plant trees and do not survive, so here are the tree planting methods introduced as follows: Each place should find tree seedlings that are compatible with the local soil properties. No matter what kind of tree seedlings are planted, the pit should be dug larger and deeper. For example, when planting cypress trees, first scoop some water into the pit, fill it with some soil, stir the water and soil into a thin paste, then put the cypress tree roots into the pit, shake it a few times to make all the tree roots stick to the mud paste, straighten the tree seedlings, then fill the pit with soil, fill most of the pit with soil, and then lift the tree seedlings slightly upward to make all the roots of the tree seedlings spread downward, and then fill the soil and compact it. In addition, a round pit should be dug around the roots of the tree seedlings, and half a bucket of water should be poured in. After the water seeps in, the water pit of the cypress tree roots should be sealed to maintain moisture, be drought-resistant for a long time, and easily survive. Planting other tree seedlings with roots is similar to this, but there is no need to stir the water and soil into a thin paste. Watering after planting will make the tree seedlings easily survive.
　　Transplanted tree seedlings will not grow vigorously for one or two years. This is a necessary phenomenon in the growth process. However, when transplanting, we must prune the side branches and crooked branches of the tree seedlings once to avoid diverting moisture. After two or three years, the tree seedlings can grow a straight head. Every year around the Qingming Festival, we must use knives and axes to repair it once. The knife repair must be smoothed, and it is easy to wrap when it grows.
　　All kinds of fruit trees must be grafted to bear good fruit. Such as persimmon trees, hawthorn trees, crabapples, apples, peaches, apricots, pears, dates, and mulberry trees, etc., must be grafted. There are many grafting experts in the countryside who have good and valuable experience in grafting trees. In the future, we must pay attention to this work. Trees that should be grafted must be grafted.
　　Due to the lack of good preparation last year, there is now a problem that there is a shortage of seedlings. Tree planting is a long-term task. If we want to solve the problem of the lack of seedlings every year when planting trees, we must quickly establish village nurseries. Each village should reserve three to five fen of land in the village public land and mobilize one or two experienced elderly people in the village to be responsible for management. Through the village mass meeting, their work hours are reduced or exempted. Each village should cultivate seedlings according to the local soil properties and the needs of the masses. As long as the management is legal, they can be planted on the mountain in three or two years. If there are American poplar strips that are easiest to grow, cut the poplar strips into six or seven-inch long shoots, insert the roots downward and the shoots upward into the seedling bed. After budding, water frequently and hoe more. In one year, tree seedlings five or six chi high can grow, and they can be moved for planting in the second year. This is my successful experience in actual testing.

　　恢复林县的森林
    林县农场  申汉兰
    种树百万棵
    我们林县自来是森林浓茂的地方，林县也是因此而得名的。经过抗战时期，由于敌伪军的盘踞摧残，以致将郁郁森林，一变而为童山秃岭的荒坡。许多繁荣的城镇及村庄，也变成了焦土。自民主政府成立后，公署民房，都计划重新建设，但以木料缺乏，难以修筑，政府有见及此，决定在今年植树时期，全县栽树一百万棵，以逐渐恢复林县的森林。林县共有四十多万人口，以平均每人栽树两棵半计算，是不难完成任务的。
    七种造林区域
    最近林县政府合作科与农场根据全县地势已决定在七种地区造林：一、道路林——有两条，一是自林县城东通安阳水冶镇的水林公路；一是自林县任村南通辉县的任辉公路，在路两旁植树造林。每边距一丈五尺远栽树一棵，树苗由该地的主人筹备栽植，利益也归他享受。二、河流林——林县有漳、渲、洪、淅四条河流，沿河地带，水份充足，栽植树木，最容易活。各河支流，与其他枯河沙滩等地，都要植树造林。三、散植林——凡各村之街头空地，街道两旁，池岸路边以及各户之空隙圆囿，地边屋角等，都要栽树，如此可培养成一种不规则的散植林。四、保岸林——各地岸头渠边，时常倒塌，以致耕作不便。因此，必须栽植树木，保护岸头，巩固渠边。五、风景林——经过土地改革后，家家户户都得到土地种，根据群众提议，在坟墓上栽几棵树，既能点缀风景，又能生长木材。六、经济林——林县是山多地少，到处皆是荒山，都能植树造林，而尤以西山是红石山，石是立层，栽树造林更容易活。例如栽培橡树，既能养蚕（山蚕），又能培养木材，以作煤矿之窑条架木。橡壳且能做染料用。黄栋树既能收藏榨油，又能培养木材。他如椿槐杨柳，榆桐楸桑等木材，修房盖屋，家具物料，皆是必需的。七、果树林——种果木树，纯是一种生产事业，如林县第十区焦家屯，及北山一带之柿饼，第二区合涧西南山之山楂，第一区魏家庄之花红、苹果、桃、李、栗子，深沟黑山一带之红枣，第十二区武家水之大梨，以及第十一区、第十二区一带之花椒、核桃等，每年收获为数甚巨，对于家庭经济，补助很大，但以近几年来，不加培养，交通阻塞，影响输出，以致每年果品收获，一落千丈。现在华北全区基本上已解放，正宜加以培养，以开利源。
    造林植树的方法
    现在已到植树时期，应赶快组织植树，根据过去经验，由于有些人不会种树栽了不活，这里特把栽树的方法介绍如下：各地方植树应找与各地方土性相宜的树苗，无论栽什么树苗，都要把坑刨大一点，深一点，例如栽柏树，要先把坑内舀上些水，填上些土，把水土搅成稀糊涂，再把柏树根放到坑内，摇几摇，使树根全部粘上泥糊，把树苗扶直，再往坑内填土，填了多半坑土，又把树苗往上略提一提使树苗的根，全部向下舒展，再将土填满踏实。另外树苗根周围，还要刨个圆坑，灌上半桶水，待水渗入后，再把柏树根的水坑封固，才能保持水份，经久耐旱，容易成活，栽种其他带根的树苗，与这也差不多，不过不用把水土搅成稀湖涂，栽后浇水，浇一次水树苗就容易成活了。
    移栽的树苗，要有一二年都生长不旺，这是生长过程中必然的现象，不过移栽的时候，我们要把树苗的旁枝邪杈，修理一次，以免分散水分。经过二三年后树苗就可长出正头。每年在清明节前后，要用刀斧修理一次，刀修要削平，长的时候，才容易包裹。
    各种果树都要经过嫁接，才能结好果子。如柿树、山楂树、花红、苹果、桃、杏、梨、枣以及桑树等，均要嫁接。乡村内有不少的接树能手，对于接树，有很好的宝贵经验。今后我们要把这一工作重视起来，应接的树，须要经过嫁接。
    由于去年未好好准备，现在有个问题就是树苗缺乏。植树是一件长期的工作，要想解决每年栽树时缺苗的问题，我们要赶快成立村苗圃，各村就村公地内，留地三分至五分，动员村上富有种树经验的老人一人至二人，负责经营管理，通过村上群众会议，减免他们的勤工。各村应按照当地的土性，与群众的要求，培养树苗。只要管理合法，三二年内，就能出山定植。如果有美国杨条最易生长，把杨条裁成六七寸长的笋子，将根部向下，梢部向上，斜插苗床内，出芽后，勤灌浇，多耘锄，一年就能长五六尺高的树苗，第二年就能移开定植，这是我实地试验成功的经验。
