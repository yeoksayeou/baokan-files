Bereavement Compensation Can Be Reclaimed
Editor:
During the War of Resistance Against Japan, my brother, Zhang Jianguo, was the captain of the Third Squad of the Wuxian Home Guard Brigade. In 1942, during the "May 1st" anti-mopping-up campaign in Central Hebei, he led his team in bravely resisting the enemy who were seizing grain in Beihou Village, Wuji County, and heroically sacrificed himself. At that time, due to the harsh environment, he was hastily buried on the spot by the village granary after the event, without even a coffin. How should his bereavement issue be resolved now? My family has no labor force. Can the village help retrieve his body? Please reply so that we can act in accordance with the regulations.

Comrade Kuangheng:
Does your brother have any direct relatives? If so, and if they have not received bereavement compensation before, they can apply to the local county government for bereavement compensation. As for the issue of exhuming the body, as the weather is gradually warming up, the government has notified all localities to temporarily suspend exhumation. It can be done in winter. In the future, when you go, only one or two members of your family need to go to direct and plan, and the villages and stations will assist in the transfer. Regarding the coffin issue, if it is true that he was buried naked at that time, the village where the body is located can provide proof. After approval by the county, a coffin subsidy of no more than 300 catties of millet will be issued.

　　抚恤费可以补领编辑同志：
    抗战期间，我哥张建国，在无县保家大队三小队当队长，一九四二年冀中“五一”反扫荡时，他率队在无极县北侯村抗击抢粮敌人而壮烈牺牲。当时因环境恶劣，事后由村仓慌就地掩埋，也未装棺椁。现在他的抚恤问题应如何解决。我家没有劳动力。是否可由村里帮助起回尸首？请答复，以便照章办事。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十九兵团政治部张匡衡匡衡同志：
    你哥是否还有直系亲属？如有，以前没有领过抚恤的话，可到当地县政府请求抚恤。至于起尸问题，因现在天气渐暖，政府已通知各地暂不起运，可待到冬天再办，将来去时只需你家去一、二人指挥筹划，各村各站会予以协助转过。棺木问题，果真当时是裸体葬埋，可让尸体所在村证明，经过该县批准后，便会发给小米三百市斤以下之棺木补助费。
