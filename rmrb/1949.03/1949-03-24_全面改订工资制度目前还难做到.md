　　Comprehensive revision of the wage system is still difficult to achieve
    To the Editor: As a loyal reader of your newspaper, I would like to offer a suggestion regarding our North China Railway Bureau in the spirit of speaking my mind.

    Since the liberation of North China, it is said that the salaries of railway employees are still based on the salary grade system, with the "@" number as the standard for payment, so that employees are not affected by price fluctuations and can maintain a basic standard of living. However, the salary grades of employees during the Kuomintang rule were unfair. Those who were close to the bandit party or had personal connections had higher salaries, while ordinary employees had lower salaries. For example, when the Kuomintang came to take over after the surrender of Japan, a station attendant with a salary of 40 yuan was transformed into a stationmaster with a salary of 200 yuan due to good personal connections. On the other hand, a stationmaster with a salary of 150 yuan was demoted to an employee with a salary of 80 yuan on the grounds of being "too deeply enslaved." The comparison between the two is really unreasonable. In order to save expenses and make the treatment of employees reasonable, the salary grades of all employees in the past should be reviewed and adjusted. The adjustment standard should be based on the work ability and loyalty to the people's railway cause, in addition to verifying the salary certificates of employees' past positions. The old system of "appointing people" based on "favoritism," "relatives," and "friends" should be abolished, and replaced with a new system of "appointing people on their merits." This would make the treatment of employees more fair and reasonable.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Railway Worker Zhenhua
Mr. Zhenhua:

    The government's continued use of the original position and salary wage system for railway employees after the liberation of Peiping is due to the impossibility of comprehensively revising the wage system all at once under the current circumstances, which is difficult. Moreover, the wage system inherited from the supply system in the old liberated areas is not suitable for large enterprises in big cities. Therefore, in the initial period of taking over bureaucratic capital, the wage system and wage standards of the original enterprises are temporarily implemented. The wage system during the Kuomintang rule did have the kind of unreasonable situation you mentioned, and the People's Government will implement reforms in a step-by-step and planned manner. It is inappropriate and detrimental to the workers to rush to revise the wage system and wage standards based solely on subjective ideas without a detailed understanding and grasp of the situation. Under the general maintenance of the original wage standards, appropriate calculations should be made according to the changes in various commodity prices and our currency value to ensure that the actual income of workers and staff is not lower than the actual income before liberation. The method of calculating wage standards based on "xī@"① is based on this situation. However, when calculating past salaries, the average actual wage in the three months before liberation should be used as the standard. In order to improve enthusiasm and reduce costs, some temporary reward and punishment methods can be stipulated. Those who are active in their work, cherish public property, and save well should be rewarded, while those who are lazy, wasteful, corrupt, and steal should be punished. Some newly liberated areas have initially established relatively unified wage standards, which should be maintained and improved.

### 全面改订工资制度目前还难做到

专栏：询问与答覆

　　全面改订工资制度目前还难做到
    编辑同志：我是贵报的一个忠实读者，本着有话就说的态度，对我们华北铁路局有一个建议。
    我华北解放之后，据闻铁路员工的待遇，仍用薪级制度，而依“＠”数为支给的标准，使员工们不受物价波动的影响，而保持温饱。但员工们的薪级，在国民党统治的时候，是不公允的，若是匪党的嫡系，或有人情关系的人员，薪金就高于一切，普通员工的薪金就低。例如日寇投降时，国民党来接收，薪俸四十元的站务员，因人事关系好，就一变而为二百元薪俸的站长。而一百五十元的站长，有的就用“奴化太深”的罪名一降而为八十元薪俸的职员。两者相较，实在是不很合理。为了节省支出，使员工的待遇合理，应将以往各级员工的薪级重加审核调整，调整的标准，除调验各员工历年任职的薪俸证件外，主要应以工作能力和对人民铁路事业的尽忠职守为依据，废除以“人情”、“亲戚”、“朋友”而“任人”的旧制度，代之以“任人唯贤”的新制度。这样就可以使员工待遇更公平合理些。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　铁路职工振华振华先生：
    北平解放后政府对铁路员工仍然采用原职原薪的工资制，这是由于在目前情况下，不可能一下子全面改订工资制度，这是困难的。而老解放区过去那种因袭供给制度而来的工资制度，也不适用于大城市的大企业。因此在接管官僚资本最初一个时期内，暂且实行原来企业的工资制度和工资标准。在国民党统治时期的工资制度确有如你所说的那种不合理情况，人民政府当有步骤有计划地实行改革。在没有详细了解与掌握情况，单凭主观想法，即忙乱地改订工资制度与工资标准，是不妥当的，反于工人不利的。在一般地维持原来工资标准之下，当按照各项物价变动的情况与我们的币值，加以适当的计算，使工人和职员的实际所得不低于在解放前的实际所得，以“ｘī＠①”数为计算工资标准的办法，就是根据这种情况来的。但在计算过去的薪资时，应以解放前三个月的平均实际工资为标准。为了提高积极性，减低成本，可规定一些临时性的奖惩办法，对工作积极、爱护公物、节约好的，给以奖励，而对怠工、浪费、贪污、偷窃的则给以处罚。有些新解放地区，已经初步订立了比较统一的工资标准，则应当保持并加以改进。
