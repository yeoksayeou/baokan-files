    Women Go to the Fields
    Huolu Women's Federation Issues Call
    [Beiyue News] The Huolu County Women's Federation recently issued a call to all districts to further mobilize women to participate in agricultural labor. The call pointed out that women in Huolu have traditionally been accustomed to labor, and especially women in the old liberated areas have played a significant role in agricultural production such as delivering manure and hoeing. After the land reform, women have obtained the same share of land and property as men, and with the further implementation of the recent marriage policy, women's enthusiasm for production has been further enhanced. On this basis, women who have labor power but no labor habits should be mobilized to participate in agricultural labor, in order to meet the requirement of organizing more than 50 percent of women with labor power to participate in agricultural production. In the plains areas, women should be called upon to learn how to plow, hoe, plant, push carts, and drive carts, and launch a "five skills" movement to improve the production skills of women currently engaged in agricultural labor. As for non-agricultural labor women, the formalism of the past should be broken, and production groups should be organized based on their different needs, combining household labor, such as making shoes and weaving.

　　妇女下地
    获鹿妇联发出号召
    【北岳讯】获鹿县妇联会顷号召各区进一步发动妇女参加农业劳动。该号召指出获鹿妇女素有劳动习惯，特别老区妇女在送粪、锄地等农业生产上起了很大作用。土地改革后，妇女已获得了与男人同样一份土地财产，加上最近婚姻政策的进一步贯彻，妇女生产积极性更加提高，在此基础上，对有劳力而没劳动习惯的妇女，应发动她们参加农业劳动，达到组织百分之五十以上有劳力妇女参加农业生产的要求。在平原地区，应号召妇女学会耕、会锄、会种、会推车、会赶车，发起“五会”运动，把现有参加农业劳动妇女的生产技术提高一步。至于非农业劳动妇女，应打破过去形式主义的编制，根据她们不同的要求结合家庭劳动组或做鞋、织布等小组进行生产。
