　　Huolu County Committee
    Inspects Production Work
    Jiaohe Tenth District Revises Production Plan
    [Huolu News] The Huolu County Committee recently inspected the implementation of production arrangements. Since the production plan for this year and the production requirements before Qingming were arranged in February, considerable achievements have been made in more than twenty days. For example, Li Liangzi, a farmer in Dongyang City in the Sixth District, said after hearing the propaganda: "This year, I must make a good plan and plant a few more acres of cotton." The county promotion agency has purchased 20,000 catties of cotton seeds and 5,000 catties of peanuts, ready to sell them to farmers below the market price. Yuanquan Canal released its initial water flow at the end of the first lunar month to facilitate the masses in planting vegetables and early-maturing crops. It is estimated that after the three canals were changed to private operation last year, the farmers prepared wood and stone materials last winter and are now working on repairs. The county promotion agency is rushing to make 2,000 water scoops to cooperate with the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency to supply farmers with waterwheels. The Second District has designated a restricted mountain area, and the county promotion agency is preparing 50 catties of ailanthus seeds and 100 catties of apricot seeds. The Eighth District has contracted out the land of military dependents who are unable to cultivate it. However, due to the failure of the leadership to pay good attention to seasonality, the production work was not placed on the county party committee's main agenda until before the "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects) solar term. Therefore, all cadres and the masses were not put into production, and the development of some work lagged behind the masses. For this reason, the county party committee decided to put production work first on the agenda, and all work should revolve around large-scale production. The focus of production from now until Qingming is determined to be: a concentrated afforestation campaign, solving the problem of plowing for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers without labor, and mobilizing the masses to prepare seeds (mainly peanuts and cotton).

    [Jizhong News] Jiaohe Tenth District reviewed the leadership's production work and re-formulated the leadership plan for the future. After the county's large-scale production conference, the district began to lead production work, but the work has been small in the past ten days. The reasons are: First, the district committee leadership has no plan and simply distributes the superior's plan as it is. Second, in mobilizing the masses, only one-sided attention was paid to mobilizing cotton and peanut planting; and the mobilization of all labor to invest in production was ignored. When district cadres arrive in the village, most of them did not first mobilize within the party, so the work could not progress. Difficulties cannot be resolved in time during the work, such as the difficulty of hemp seeds, which has not yet been resolved.
    It is decided that in the future: First, district cadres must first study relevant production documents, conduct collective learning every two days, and raise questions for research and resolution. Second, the leadership of the village must ideologically mobilize all party members and cadres, take the branch as the core, lead and promote the work, and be good at using various meetings and various methods for extensive publicity. At the same time, we must solve various difficulties in production according to the specific situation.

### 获鹿县委  检查生产工作  交河十区重订生产计划

　　获鹿县委
    检查生产工作
    交河十区重订生产计划
    【获鹿讯】获鹿县委近检查生产布置执行情形。自二月间布置了今年生产计划及清明前生产要求后，在二十多天中，收到了不少成绩。如六区东羊市农民李亮子听到宣传后说：“今年一定好好打算一下，多种上几亩棉花。”县推进社已购入棉籽二万斤、花生五千斤，准备低于市价卖给农民。源泉渠于旧历正月底已放下头水，以利群众种菜及早熟作物；计三渠去年改为民办后，农民去冬已准备好木石材料，现已动工整修。县推进社正赶制水斗二千个，以配合华北水利推进社供给农民增添水车之用。二区已划定禁山区域，县推进社并准备椿树籽五十斤、杏树籽一百斤。八区已将无力耕种的军属土地，进行了包耕。但由于领导上未能很好的注意季节性，一直到惊蛰前，生产工作还未放在县委主要议事日程。因此，未将全体干部及群众投入生产中去，某些工作发展落在群众后面。为此，县委决定：把生产工作放在议事日程的第一位，一切工作围绕大生产进行。目前至清明生产重点确定为：突击植树造林，解决无劳力的烈军工属代耕问题，发动群众准备籽种（主要是花生、棉花）等工作。（侯永）
    【冀中讯】交河十区检讨领导生产工作，重新订出今后领导计划。该区在县大生产会议后，就着手领导生产工作，但十余天来，工作成绩甚小。原因是：一、区委领导上无计划，只把上级计划照样布下去。二、在动员群众时，只片面注意了发动种棉花、花生；并忽视了发动所有劳动力投入生产。区干部到村后，一般的也都未先在党内进行动员，以致工作不能进展。在工作中不能及时解决困难，如大麻种籽困难问题，迄今尚未解决。
    决定今后：一、区干部首先要学习有关生产文件，每隔两天集体学习一次，提出问题研究解决。二、对村的领导，必须从思想上动员全体党员干部，以支部为核心，领导推动工作，善于运用各种不同的会议，及各种方式进行广泛的宣传。同时要根据具体情况，解决生产中的各种困难。
