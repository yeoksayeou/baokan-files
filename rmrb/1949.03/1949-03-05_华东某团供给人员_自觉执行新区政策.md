Supply Personnel of a Certain Regiment in East China
Consciously Implement Policies in Newly Liberated Areas

During the Huaihai Campaign, when logistics supply personnel of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army were procuring supplies in newly liberated areas, they resolutely implemented policies, observed discipline, and conducted propaganda and education among the masses. When procuring military grain in Runji Township, Tongshan County, they first propagated the victorious situation of the People's Liberation War to the residents to dispel the masses' concerns. Then, they sought out former local cadres familiar with the local situation (the area had been occupied by the enemy for a long time, and former village cadres dared not engage in open activities). When they found an old peasant association director surnamed Zhang to help procure grain, the burden on the people of the whole village became fairer and more reasonable. They were even more considerate of the suffering of the masses in the newly liberated areas and automatically took care of the interests of the masses. For example, when procuring grain in Mayuan Village, Tongshan County, a newly liberated area, they learned that the area had been flooded and had suffered from the Kuomintang's looting and conscription, leaving very little wheat and millet. When a head of household procured some wheat and millet for them, they sincerely said to the villagers, "This place has been devastated too severely by the Kuomintang. You should leave this grain for your elderly and children to eat! Our troops are all young people; you can just give us whatever the young people eat!" The villagers were very moved and spread the word, "We have never seen such a good army." The young people who had been hiding outside also returned home to help them procure grain. In order to avoid placing too heavy a burden on the people in one place, they often ran to distant places to procure grain, regardless of fatigue. Comrade Ma Lianshou, the deputy supply platoon leader of a certain company, bought a pig in Zhouzhuang. The seller said that it could yield thirty catties of meat to offset the price. However, when they returned to the troops and butchered it, it yielded forty catties of meat. On the third day, he returned ten catties of meat's worth of money to the seller. In order to save manpower, they carried grain themselves. Zhu Hongxiang, the deputy supply platoon leader of the machine gun company, had nosebleeds several times. The instructor approved his request to hire civilian porters, but he still carried it himself. The supply personnel of the first company even ground their own flour without using civilian manpower. In the past, when procuring supplies for the troops in newly liberated areas, there were often many difficulties because the People's Liberation Army lacked direct contact with the residents of these areas, and the people's democratic government had not yet been established or had been established only recently. Individual logistics supply personnel were prone to violating policies and discipline. However, the logistics supply personnel of this regiment were able to consciously implement policies and abide by discipline. This was because the regiment had concentrated supply personnel such as quartermasters, supply platoon leaders, and sergeants to study policies and discipline during the campaign mobilization phase, and had conducted detailed research and made decisions on specific difficulties that might be encountered, such as the currency system and shopping issues in the newly liberated areas.

　　华东某团供给人员
  　自觉执行新区政策
    【新华社华东二十七日电】解放军某团后勤供给人员，淮海战役中在新解放区筹办给养时，坚决执行政策，遵守纪律并向群众进行宣传教育。在铜山县润集乡筹办军粮时，他们首先向居民宣传人民解放战争的胜利形势，打破群众的顾虑，然后又寻找熟悉当地情况的过去的地方干部（该地久经敌人侵占，过去的村干部不敢公开活动），当找到一位姓张的老农会主任，出面帮助筹粮，使全村人民的负担更为公平合理。他们更体贴新区群众的痛苦，自动照顾群众利益。如在新解放的铜山县马园庄筹粮时，了解到该区被水淹过，并遭受国民党的抢劫抓丁，剩下的麦子小米很少。当一个甲长筹办了一些小麦与小米给他们时，他们便诚恳地对村民说：“这个地方国民党糟踏得太苦了，这些粮食还是留给你们老年人小孩吃吧！我们部队里都是青年人，你们青年人吃什么就搞什么给我们吧！”村民很受感动，纷纷传说：“从来没有看到这样的好队伍。”躲在外面的青年人也都回家来帮助他们筹粮。为了不使一个地方的人民负担太重，他们常常不顾疲劳，分散跑到很远地方去筹粮。某连副管理排长马连寿同志在周庄买到一口猪，卖主说可杀三十斤肉以此折价，但回到部队杀了四十斤肉，第三天他又补了十斤肉钱给卖主。他们为了节省民力，自己挑运粮食。机枪连副管理排长朱洪祥，鼻子数次出血，教导员批准他请民夫挑，但他仍自己挑着。一连供给人员并且做到自己磨面，不用民力。按在刚才新解放的地区筹办部队给养，由于人民解放军过去与这些地方的居民缺乏直接接触，而人民民主政权则尚未建立或建立不久，往往有很多困难，个别后勤供给人员就容易发生违犯政策和纪律的现象。而该团后勤供给人员则能自觉地执行政策和遵守纪律，这是由于该团在战役动员阶段中，曾集中军需、管理排长、上士等供给人们，学习政策纪律，并对可能碰到的具体困难，如新区币制与购物问题。作了详细研究与决定。
