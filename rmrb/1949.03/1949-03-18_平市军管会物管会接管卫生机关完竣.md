　　The Ping City Military Control Commission Property Management Committee Completes Takeover of Health Agencies

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Health Takeover Department of the Property Takeover Committee of the Ping City Military Control Commission has completed the takeover and inventory work. It is now organizing personnel from the original Kuomintang health agencies to study and preparing for their resettlement. From the liberation of Beiping City to the 15th of this month, the department has officially taken over 49 units (plus more than ten small units not included in the statistics) of Kuomintang health agencies, hospitals, health centers, pharmaceutical factories, and health equipment warehouses, including the Kuomintang Fifth Supply Zone Command Military Medical Office, the Seventh Garrison Headquarters Military Medical Office, the Beiping Army General Hospital, and the Central Epidemic Prevention Experimental Office. During the takeover process, the department successively carried out work such as receiving and handling wounded and sick Kuomintang soldiers, taking over the Kuomintang health agencies in Beiping City, registering scattered and unemployed health medical personnel, receiving medical and technical personnel, inventorying medical equipment and materials, organizing re-examinations in various hospitals, arranging living conditions for personnel of the original Kuomintang health agencies, and organizing their study. At the time of the liberation of Beiping, there were approximately 7,059 wounded and sick Kuomintang soldiers. About 1,000 of them were scattered in various places. The department actually accommodated about 6,000 of them and arranged for treatment in various army hospitals. 846 have been cured and assisted by the Dispersed Soldiers Handling Committee to be incorporated into the North China People's Liberation Army. For the old, weak, and disabled Kuomintang wounded and sick soldiers, they were properly discharged and sent back to their original places for resettlement. More than 800 have been discharged and more than 1,000 are preparing to be discharged; the personnel who have been discharged back to their original places are given three months' salary and travel expenses according to different levels. For those who still need to be hospitalized for recuperation, they are still properly treated and will be resettled at the discretion after they are cured. After the department handled the registration of scattered and unemployed health medical personnel, 350 medical and technical personnel of various types have come to register. They are being understood and reviewed, and are preparing to be employed or resettled at the discretion. The department has set up two reception centers for the reception of medical and technical personnel, accommodating a total of 114 people. After the department took over the health agencies and hospitals in Beiping, it quickly carried out re-examination work. The Beiping Army General Hospital has been designated to be responsible for the diagnosis and treatment and accommodation of patients from the People's Liberation Army and various agencies. The original Thirty-First Hospital, the Eleventh Medical Prevention Brigade, the Beiping Clinic and other hospitals can provide outpatient treatment for cadres of the People's Liberation Army. Those cadres of the People's Liberation Army who have tuberculosis can be introduced by the Ministry of Health to the Beiping Anti-Tuberculosis Association for free X-ray examination. Free treatment for gynecology and pediatrics for female cadres of the People's Liberation Army and their family members is also being prepared. (Health Takeover Department)
