Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: According to a dispatch from Telecommunications Agency in New York on the 3rd: Regarding the despicable plot of the American reactionaries to continue the illegal "interrogation" of the CPUSA leaders, the CPUSA leaders recently issued a statement exposing it, pointing out that this is part of Wall Street's new war preparations. The government and its Republican allies hope to take this opportunity to use this "trial" to incite "public opinion," create new war mania, and forcibly pass new war budgets and the North Atlantic War Alliance.

The illegal "interrogation" of CPUSA leaders by the American reactionary court began on January 17th. Due to the CPUSA leaders and their defense lawyers' resolute protest against the court's unconstitutional selection of the jury, the court authorities were forced to provide evidence that the jury was composed of the wealthy and their lackeys, so that the "interrogation" could not be formally opened. During this period, Judge Medina, enraged by the CPUSA leaders' exposure of the jury system that discriminates against workers, blacks, and Jews, even stopped their speeches on the 14th. More recently, he intensified his actions, ordering on the 3rd to terminate the evidence regarding the class nature of the jury composition and announced that the "interrogation" of the case would begin on the 7th.

During the 27 days of "interrogation," the CPUSA defense lawyers have already presented countless evidence proving that workers and blacks have been consistently excluded in the selection of the jury, and that 90% of the jurors are representatives of the wealthy class. Workers account for less than 5% of the total jury, and less than 1% in the federal jury. However, workers and their families account for more than half of the total population.

### 美共领袖发表声明　揭露美帝“审讯”阴谋

　　美共领袖发表声明
  　揭露美帝“审讯”阴谋
    【新华社陕北七日电】据电通社纽约三日讯：对于美国反动派继续非法“审讯”美共领袖的卑劣阴谋，美共领袖顷发表声明予以揭露，指出：这乃是华尔街新战争准备的一部分。政府及其共和党盟友，希望趁此机会利用这个“审判”来煽动“舆论”，制造新的战争狂，强行通过新的战争预算和北大西洋战争联盟。
    美国反动法庭对美共领袖的非法“审讯”，开始于一月十七日。由于美共领袖及其辩护律师坚决抗议法院违宪选择陪审团，迫使法院当局进行关于陪审团是由富豪及其走狗组成的举证，以致始终未能正式开庭“审讯”。其间，法官麦迪纳曾因美共领袖揭露歧视工人、黑人和犹太人的陪审团制度，老羞成怒，竟于十四日一度制止他们的发言。近更变本加厉，于三日下令终止对陪审团组成分子阶级本质的举证，并宣布自七日开始就本案进行“审讯”。
    在二十七天的“审讯”中，美共辩护律师已经举出无数证据，证明在陪审团的选择中，工人、黑人是一贯地遭受排斥的，百分之九十的陪审员是富有阶级的代表。工人在全部陪审团中所占人数不及百分之五，在联邦陪审团中则不及百分之一。然而，工人及其家属却占全人口的一半以上。
