    Hosts Banquet for Women's Congress Representatives
    General Lin Biao Delivers Impromptu Speech
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The General Headquarters of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front hosted a banquet at the Beijing Hotel yesterday evening (March 29th) at 7:00 PM to entertain all the representatives of the First National Congress of Chinese Women. General Lin Biao delivered an impromptu speech. He first explained that Chinese women have made significant contributions to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggles over the years, and in particular, have warmly supported the People's Liberation War, giving the soldiers great encouragement. He emphasized that the issue of the liberation of Chinese women is a part of the Chinese revolution and that Chinese women must advance with the development of the whole society in order to demand further liberation.
    Finally, General Lin Biao wished the congress success. The thunderous applause and cheers of "Long Live the Chinese People's Liberation Army" resounded throughout the hall for a long time.
    Kang Ying, the representative from East China, delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of all the representatives of the congress. After she paid her respects to the People's Liberation Army on behalf of everyone, she powerfully called on all the representatives to make sure the congress is a success, to mobilize the broad masses of women to step up production, support the front lines, participate in the construction of the new China, and support the People's Liberation Army in going south to liberate all of China!
    Lei Jieqiong, the representative from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, shouted: Welcome General Lin Biao to the south! We will meet in Nanjing and Guangzhou! She said: We believe that the name of the Kuomintang-controlled areas will become a historical term at the next congress.
    Cheers and songs merged into one, and the whole hall was filled with a joyful and enthusiastic atmosphere. (Bai Sheng, Wang Jing)
