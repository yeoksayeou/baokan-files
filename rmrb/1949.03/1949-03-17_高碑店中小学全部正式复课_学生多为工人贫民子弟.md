　　All Primary and Secondary Schools in Gaobeidian Officially Reopen
  　Students Mostly Children of Workers and Poor Peasants
    [Ping City News] All twelve primary and secondary schools in the Gaobeidian area have now fully and officially reopened. Student enrollment is very enthusiastic. The Municipal Girls' Fourth Middle School now has 236 students actually attending. The eleven primary schools in the entire area have enrolled a total of 1,767 boys and girls. Except for a small number of students who transferred to schools in the city due to their homes being demolished and moved, and a portion who returned to their original hometowns, the rest are completely enrolled and attending classes. Because each school continues to recruit students, more than 300 new students have been added. Eighty percent of the newly enrolled children are the children of workers and poor peasants. One student's parent, Grandpa Chen, said: "In the past, how could children from poor families like ours have the chance to go to school! Now, we are finally liberated, and our children can also go to school!"

　　高碑店中小学全部正式复课
  　学生多为工人贫民子弟
    【平市讯】高碑店全区中小学十二处，现已完全正式开学复课。入学学生甚为踊跃。现市立女四中实到学生二百三十六名。全区十一处小学，入学男女生已达一千七百六十七名。除一少部份学生因家房被拆搬至城内转学及一部返回原籍外，其余完全入学上课了。因各校继续招考，故又增加新生三百余名。此次新入学的儿童，百分之八十是工人及贫民的子弟。有一个学生家长陈老大爷说：“在过去哪有我们穷人家的孩子上学的份呀！现在，到底是解放了，我们孩子也能够上学啦！”
