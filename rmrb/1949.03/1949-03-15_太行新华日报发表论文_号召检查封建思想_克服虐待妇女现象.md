(Taihang Electric Dispatch) *Taihang Xinhua Daily* published an article regarding the continued domestic abuse of women in certain villages in Ci County, calling on leadership organs at all levels to pay serious attention to the infringement of women's rights to marital autonomy and even the infringement of women's human rights. The article stated: The root cause of this infringement of women's rights is the traditional ideology of valuing men over women and feudal customs, which are difficult to completely eliminate in a short period of time due to long-standing habits. This exists to varying degrees not only among male and female farmers, but also remains in the minds of some of our cadres. This is reflected in the treatment of women's work or the handling of women's issues, emphasizing men's interests and neglecting women's suffering. We suggest that leaders at all levels in various regions should conduct an ideological review of women's work, otherwise women's work will not be valued. Secondly, extensive education and criticism should be carried out to gradually eliminate this feudal traditional ideology and enable women to achieve complete liberation.

　　太行新华日报发表论文
    号召检查封建思想  克服虐待妇女现象
    【太行电】此间新华日报对磁县某些村庄妇女仍受家庭虐待的行为，发表论文，唤起各级领导机关严重注意侵害妇女婚姻自主权利以至侵害妇女人权的现象，该论文称：这种侵害妇女权利现象发生的根本原因，是由于重男轻女传统思想及封建习俗，因习太久，一时难于根本消除，不但在男女农民中或多或少的存在着，而且在我们个别干部的思想上也有残留。表现在对待妇女工作或处理妇女问题上，强调男人利益，忽视妇女痛苦，我们建议各地各级领导，均应把妇女工作从思想上作一清算，否则妇女工作不会被重视起来的。其次，应开展广泛的教育与批评，在工作中逐渐消除这种封建传统思想，使妇女得到完全解放。
