　　North China People's Government Medical Team
    Assists PingShan People to Eradicate Smallpox
    Organizes Local Chinese and Western Medicine Doctors to Promote Epidemic Prevention Movement
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government Health Department's epidemic prevention medical team, in order to eradicate the smallpox epidemic in the Pingshan area, carried a large number of vaccines to various districts on February 26th to universally inoculate with cowpox. The team focused on the second district, driving other districts, uniting existing doctors, and teaching elementary school teachers and cadres the method of vaccination. As of the 25th, universal vaccination in the entire district was completed. According to incomplete statistics from 22 villages in the second district, out of a total population of 17,943, 3,180 people were vaccinated, accounting for a little over 17%; while out of 6,002 children under the age of 15, 1,984 were vaccinated, accounting for a little over 33%. During the vaccination, costumed propaganda and individual visits were conducted, imparting general health knowledge to farmers and providing medical treatment for farmers' diseases, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Through the continuous efforts of the team members, the spread of smallpox has been curbed. Initially, there were 372 smallpox patients in 12 villages in the second district, with more than 30 deaths. In Nanwanglou Village, out of 1,561 residents, 83 people were infected with smallpox. After careful diagnosis and treatment by the team, the mortality rate was greatly reduced.
    In order to develop a mass health movement and gain experience, the team has designated Pingshan as an experimental county, with Huishe Town, Fengcheng, and Beiwanglou in the second district as base villages, combining epidemic prevention work with disease and maternal and child health surveys. A medical and health committee has been organized, including the deputy county magistrate, the head of the civil affairs section, the director of the Women's Federation, and local health personnel. It is planned to universally organize health committees and health teams in various districts and villages in the future, and to establish medical and pharmaceutical cooperatives. On the 3rd of this month, the medical team also convened a Chinese and Western Medicine Research Association in Huishe Town, establishing regulations, eliminating prejudices, promoting the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and exchanging experiences. The doctors' morale was extremely high. The team also plans to open a short-term women's training class soon to improve the education of existing midwives and train new delivery women, instilling maternal and child health knowledge.　　　　　　　　　　　(Xiao Ying)
