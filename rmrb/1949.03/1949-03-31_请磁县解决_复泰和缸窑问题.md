To the Ci County Committee and County Government: The Futaixiang Kiln, jointly operated by Zhu Jun and Zhu Lianhan from Sanhe Street, Pengcheng, in your county, was confiscated. Recently, our agency received letters from them requesting its return. As we are not aware of the detailed situation, we cannot provide an answer. We hope you will send someone to investigate and resolve this matter promptly, and inform us of the results.
