　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: In order to counter the aggressive actions of U.S. monopoly capitalists in preparing a new war, a movement to support peace is unfolding worldwide. They are enthusiastically preparing to send representatives to the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris next month. This movement has gained extremely enthusiastic responses from workers, collective farmers, women, and cultural workers in various sectors of the Soviet Union. The Polish General Confederation of Labor has decided to send representatives, representing three and a half million organized Polish workers, to attend the conference. The Polish Women's League, representing one million members, has also announced its participation in the conference. The initiating committee of the World Peace Congress, located in Paris, continues to receive many letters and telegrams of support from people of various countries. Cultural workers in Belgium have sent several telegrams expressing their support for the conference. Former Mexican President Cárdenas has requested to participate as an initiator of the conference. Five hundred housewives in Preston (in Lancashire), England, signed a peace petition, protesting the war-mongering policies of British and American politicians, and declaring that they vow to use all their power to end the current situation where British interests are subordinate to American imperialist policies. The petition has been submitted to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, and the two members of Parliament from Preston.
