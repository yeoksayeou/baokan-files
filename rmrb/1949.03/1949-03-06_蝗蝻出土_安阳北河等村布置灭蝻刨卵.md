　　Locust Nymphs Emerge
  　Beihhe and Other Villages in Anyang Deploy to Eradicate Nymphs and Dig Up Eggs
    [Taihang Telegram] Last year, the Fifth Special District of the Taihang-Northern Henan area suffered severe insect plagues, prevalent throughout the region. Over five hundred villages were affected, with approximately 105,000 mu of fields and seedlings eaten and destroyed. Anyang, Tangyin, and Linxian counties were particularly hard hit. Although the majority were eliminated through mass efforts, some marginal areas, due to enemy sabotage, were not thoroughly eradicated, leaving behind locust eggs. Currently, in the sixth district of Anyang, locust nymphs have been discovered emerging in six villages, including Guoli and Beihhe, as well as one village in the seventh district and one village in the eighth district. The nymphs are the size of ants and are mostly found in sunny areas and along the roots of dams and in wasteland. To promptly eliminate the locust nymphs, the Anyang leadership has taken urgent measures: 1. The deputy chief of the Cooperation Section has been dispatched to the area to organize the masses to eradicate the nymphs and mobilize them to dig up eggs. 2. All districts have been notified to rapidly deploy and inspect areas where locust remnants were left behind last year, to eliminate them whenever they are found. 3. A temporary exchange system of one jin of rice for one jin of eggs or one jin of nymphs has been established to alleviate the spring famine among the masses and to reward cadres and masses who are active in locust eradication. 4. Each level of command should have dedicated personnel responsible for locust eradication. 5. The slogans are: 1. Eradicating nymphs is essential for production. 2. If locust eggs are not dug up, wheat seedlings cannot be protected. 3. Protecting seedlings is protecting lives. After receiving the notice of locust nymph emergence in Anyang, the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office immediately issued an urgent circular, ordering all areas to immediately inspect, emphasizing the importance and recognition that "eradicating nymphs" is the first hurdle in spring plowing and production, and must be discovered and eliminated at any time. All areas where locusts were found last year must assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for inspection, and no negligence is allowed.

　　蝗蝻出土
  　安阳北河等村布置灭蝻刨卵
    【太行电】太行豫北地区五专区去年虫灾严重，普遍各地，被灾村达五百个以上，吃毁吃光田苗达十万五千亩左右，其中尤以安阳、汤阴、林县为最重，经群众努力剿打，虽大部被歼，但有些边沿区由于敌人破坏，剿打不彻底留下残余，致使产下蝗卵。现安阳六区之郭里、北河等六个村，及七区一个村，八区一个村，已发现蝗蝻出土，大小如蚂蚁，多在向阳地带，堰根荒地里最多。为及时扑灭蝗蝻，安阳领导机关即作了紧急措施：一、派合作科副科长亲往该区组织群众剿灭蝗蝻并发动刨卵。二、通报各区急速布置检查去年留有蚂蚱残余地区，随时发现随时消灭。三、暂定一斤米一斤卵或一斤蝻的兑换办法，目的是为解决群众春荒，并随时奖励剿蝗积极的干部和群众。四、各级指挥部应有专人负责剿蝗。五、提出口号是：一、生产必先灭蝻，二、蝗卵刨不了麦苗保不了，三、保苗即保命等。五专署接获安阳发现蝗蝻通报后，当即发出紧急通报，令各地立即检查，强调重视和认识“灭蝻”是春耕生产的第一关，要随时发现，随时消灭。凡去年发现蝗虫的地区，必须派定专人负责检查，不能有所忽视。
