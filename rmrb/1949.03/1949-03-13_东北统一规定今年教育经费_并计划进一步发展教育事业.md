Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. The Northeast Liberated Area's education funding for 1949 has been initially unified by the Northeast Administrative Committee, with plans to further develop education in the Northeast this year. The Northeast Administrative Committee has decided that this year's education funding for the entire Northeast will be borne by governments at all levels. The Northeast Administrative Committee will be responsible for the funding of all public universities, specialized schools, provincial, county, and municipal middle schools, normal schools, various cadre schools, special municipality and provincial city-run primary schools, and municipal social education institutions (such as public education centers, libraries, stadiums, museums, etc.). The expenses of county, district, and town primary schools and county and district social education will be borne by the provincial and county governments. If the competent enterprise departments of industrial and mining area primary schools have financial difficulties, the expenses can be subsidized by the provincial education funds or be entirely run by the province. The publicly funded portion of privately run rural primary schools (including rural primary schools and rural social education belonging to special municipalities and provincial cities) will be borne by local grain taxes. If the local grain taxes in individual areas are indeed insufficient, the provincial and county governments may provide subsidies. The total budget for middle and primary school and social education expenses borne by the Northeast in 1949, excluding Rehe Province, which has not yet made a budget, has been approved by the Northeast Administrative Committee, and payments have begun. The total budgeted amount is 225,197 tons (2,000 jin per ton) of sorghum. In addition, a unified budget for the expenses of various specialized schools, universities, and cadre schools will also be made soon. The education expenses borne by the finances of various provinces and counties have also been budgeted separately by various localities. The Northeast Administrative Committee and various provinces, counties, and cities will guarantee that this year's education funds are paid on schedule according to the budget and will try to ensure that the entire budget is not affected by price fluctuations, so that the education cause of cultivating a large number of talents for new democratic construction can proceed normally. This year, the funding for secondary schools and above and urban primary schools in the Northeast has been basically resolved and guaranteed. As for the funding of rural primary schools, some areas have not been fully resolved due to insufficient local grain tax distribution. The Northeast Administrative Committee is currently studying ways to solve this problem. In this year's education funding in the Northeast, in addition to a portion for teachers' salaries and school construction costs, another portion is for the expenses of a large number of publicly funded students. The Northeast Administrative Committee stipulates that all students in universities and specialized schools, students in normal schools, and students in farmer-cadre classes or worker-peasant classes in ordinary middle schools shall be publicly funded. The quota of publicly funded students in ordinary middle school classes is, on average, 10 percent in the old liberated areas and 20 percent in the new liberated areas or special municipalities. The Northeast Administrative Committee also stipulates that publicly funded students in ordinary middle school classes are mainly the children of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, cadre families, and the laboring masses. Ordinary middle school students generally do not pay tuition fees. At the same time, the Northeast Administrative Committee also plans to consolidate and develop education in the Northeast this year. There are currently 41 universities and specialized schools in the Northeast, with 35,558 students; it is planned to enroll an additional 15,050 students this year, meaning that the number of students this year may reach 50,608. There are currently 234 middle schools in the Northeast, with 100,881 students; it is planned to increase the number of schools by 11 percent and enroll 33 percent more students this year, meaning that middle schools may develop to 260 and the number of students may develop to over 130,000. There are currently 24,785 primary schools in the Northeast, with 2,046,202 students; primary schools may increase by 20 percent and enroll 25 percent more students this year, meaning that they may develop to over 29,000 primary schools and over 2,550,000 students.

　　东北统一规定今年教育经费
    并计划进一步发展教育事业
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北解放区一九四九年度的教育经费，已经东北行政委员会初步统一解决，并计划在今年进一步发展东北的教育事业。东北行政委员会决定今年全东北的教育经费，分别由各级政府负担。凡公立大学，专门学校，省、县、市立中学，师范学校，各种干部学校，特别市及省属市市立小学、市立社会教育机关（如民教馆、图书馆、体育场、博物馆等）的经费由东北行政委员会负担。县、区、城镇小学及县区等社会教育经费由各省、县政府负担。工矿区小学如各该主管企业部门财政困难者，可由省的教育经费补助或全归省办。私办公助的农村小学（包括特别市、省属市所属之农村小学及农村社教）的经费，其公助部分由地方粮负担，个别地方的地方粮确实不足者，可由省、县政府补助。一九四九年度由东北负担的中小学及社会教育经费，除热河省尚未作出预算外，其余各省市的预算均已获得东北行政委员会的批准，并已开始支付。其预算额总计为二十二万五千一百九十七吨（每吨两千斤）高梁。此外，各专科学校、大学与干部学校的经费，不久亦将作出统一预算。至由各省、县财政负担的教育经费，亦已由各地分别编造预算。东北行政委员会和各省、县、市对于今年的教育经费，将保证根据预算按期支付，并设法使全部预算不受物价影响，俾使大量培养新民主主义建设人材的教育事业得以正常进行。今年东北中等以上学校与城镇小学的经费，基本上已经得到了解决和保障。至于农村小学的经费，有些地方由于地方粮不敷分配，尚未完全解决，东北行政委员会目前正在研究解决的办法。东北今年度的教育经费中，除一部分为教职员工薪金及学校建设费用等外，另一部分为大量公费学生的用费。东北行政委员会规定，凡大学、专科学校的学生，师范学校及普通中学中之农民干部班或工农班的学生一律公费。中学普通班次的公费生名额，在老解放区平均为百分之十，新解放区或特别市平均为百分之二十。东北行政委员会并规定，中学普遍班次公费学生主要为革命烈士、革命军人和干部家属及劳苦群众子弟。普通中学学生一般不收学费。同时，东北行政委员会又计划在今年内巩固和发展东北的教育事业。全东北现有大学及专科学校四十一所，学生三万五千五百五十八人；今年拟增收学生一万五千零五十人，即今年学生数可能达到五万六百零八人。全东北现有中学二百三十四所，学生十万零八百八十一人；今年拟增加百分之十一的学校，增收百分之三十三的学生，即今年中学可能发展到二百六十所，学生可能发展到十三万余人。全东北现有小学二万四千七百八十五所，学生二百零四万六千二百零二人；今年小学可能增加百分之二十，增收百分之二十五的学生，即可能发展到二万九千余所小学，二百五十五万余学生。
