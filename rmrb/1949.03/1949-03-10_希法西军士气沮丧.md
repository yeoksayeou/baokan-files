　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Free Greek Radio broadcast the original text of a top-secret report made by Lieutenant General Windris, inspector of the Greek Royalist Fascist Army. The report stated that the morale of the Royal Army's "commanders, officers and soldiers has been shattered." The report, dated February 15, 1949, was entitled "Report on Morale and Discipline." The report detailed the serious defeats suffered by the Royal Army's Second and Third Army Corps and local forces in the past two months in the battles for Cardi Chai, Lhasa, and Kapenisi. The report stated that these failures directly affected the morale of the entire army. The report described the prominent mood in the Royal Army's field forces as discouragement, laziness, and fear of death. The report said that too many officers and soldiers were requesting to be sent back to the rear for rest. What particularly depressed the morale of the Royal Fascist army was that before the end of the Gramos campaign, they had received unfulfilled guarantees that the war would end before winter and demobilization could begin. The report also said that the military training received by soldiers and officers was completely inadequate.

　　希法西军士气沮丧
    【新华社陕北六日电】自由希腊电台广播希腊保皇法西斯军视察官温德里斯中将所作的极机密的报告的原文。该报告称：保皇军“司令官、军官与士兵的士气业已破碎”。该报告为一九四九年二月十五日所发，名为“关于士气与纪律的报告”。该报告详述过去两月中保皇军第二与第三兵团的部队与地方部队在争夺卡迪柴、拉萨与卡彭尼西战斗中的严重失败。报告称：这些失败直接影响到全军的士气。报告叙述保皇军野战部队中显著的情绪是士气沮丧、懒惰与怕死。报告说：要求送回后方休息的军官与士兵太多了。特别使保皇法西斯军队士气低落的是：在格拉姆斯战役结束前，他们曾经得到不能兑现的保证说，战争将于冬季前结束，复员将可开始。报告又说：士兵与军官所受的军事训练完全不够。
