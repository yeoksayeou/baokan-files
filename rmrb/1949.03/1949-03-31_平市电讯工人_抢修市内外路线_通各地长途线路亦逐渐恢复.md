　　Ping City Telecommunications Workers
    Rush to Repair Internal and External Routes
    Long-Distance Lines to Various Locations Gradually Recovered
    [This Newspaper] Since liberation, the line workers of the Ping and Guan Telecommunications Bureaus in Ping City (the Ping Bureau is the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, and the Guan Bureau is the former Seventh District Telecommunications Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, which manages telecommunications in the Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan regions) have been in high spirits for production. Despite extremely scarce tools and materials, they have been carrying out rapid repairs and have made great achievements in the past month. On the Ping Bureau's side, in addition to the completion of most of the city's lines, the lines damaged in the four suburban areas are also being rushed to repair. When they were repairing the line from Shijingshan to Beiping, some forgot to eat lunch, and many even did not drink a drop of water all day, busying themselves with work. One comrade said: "We are now liberated, and we must take on the responsibility of communication and production in order to liberate the whole country!" They were a total of fifty people, divided into five shifts, each responsible for erecting poles and stringing wires, and everyone worked very hard. The work originally planned to be completed in four days was actively rushed to repair by everyone, and the more than 20 *hua* of damaged lines were all completed in two days, increasing work efficiency by one time. All 200 plus line assistants of the Ping Bureau are divided into cable, pole line, installation and removal (installation and removal of telephones) teams. In addition to the rush repair of telecommunication lines in Ping City and its four suburbs, a part of them are also transferred to Tianjin to help the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau rush to repair the city's telecommunications links. After the Tianjin lines are repaired, they will continue to rush to repair the underground cable (long-distance) between Tianjin and Gugu, completing the entire telecommunications network inside and outside Tianjin. On the Guan Bureau's side, the work of each team and section can be completed ahead of schedule. When repairing the line from Beiping to Changxindian, it was completed in only six days, and the efficiency was very good, the test calls were clear, and it was possible to connect to Zhuoxian and Baoding from Changxindian. The repair of the long-distance line between Fengtai and Langfang was expected to be completed in six days, but through their efforts, it was completed in four days. The direct telephone between Pingjin was opened on February 15, and the situation was very good. When repairing the line from Beiping to Tongxian, it was expected to be completed in ten days, but through hard work and rush repair, it was officially opened to traffic in only seven days. Now we are taking further active preparations for other lines to restore and develop the North China telecommunications network.

　　平市电讯工人
    抢修市内外路线
    通各地长途线路亦逐渐恢复
    【本报讯】平市平、管两电信局（平局即北平电讯局，管局是前伪交通部第七区电讯管理局，管理冀、鲁、晋、察、绥地区电讯事业）的线路工人，解放后，生产情绪极高，在工具、材料极感缺乏等条件下，实行迅速的抢修，一月来，获得很大成绩。在平局方面，除市内的线路已大部修竣外，四郊受破坏的线路也在赶修。他们在修石景山至北平的线路时，有的中午都忘了吃饭，甚至有许多人一天连一滴水也没喝，一直忙着工作。有一个同伴说：“我们现在解放了，一定要把通讯和生产的责任担当起来，才能把全国解放！”他们一共五十人，分成五班，分头担任立杆、架线等工作，大家都非常紧张的工作，本来计划四天完成的工作，大家积极抢修的结果，二十余华里破损之线路，两天工夫便全部完成，工作效率增加一倍。平局全体线佐二百余人，共分电缆、杆线、装撤（装撤电话）等班，现除对平市及四郊的电信线路抢修外，并调遣一部分到天津去，帮助天津电信局赶修市内的电信联络。预备津线路修复后，便接连着抢修津沽间的地下电缆（长途），完成津市内外整个的电信连络网。在管局方面，各队段工作均能提前完成。整修北平至长辛店线路时，只六天便告竣工，并且效率很好，试话清晰，并由长辛店可能接至涿县、保定等处通话。整修丰台、廊坊间的长途线路预计六天完成，经他们努力，四天即告竣工。二月十五日开放平津直达电话，情形非常良好。整修北平至通县的线路时，预计十天完成，经努力赶修，仅七天就正式通话了。现更进一步积极筹备其他线路，以恢复发展华北电讯联络网。
