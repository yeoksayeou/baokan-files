　　Jinnan Pingxiang and Other Counties
    Irrigated 700 Hectares of Land
    Grain Production to Increase by 3 Million Jin
    [This Newspaper] The counties in the Fourth Special District of Jinnan are actively irrigating and fertilizing land in preparation for large-scale production. Pingxiang expects to irrigate 2,600 hectares. 1,800 hectares were completed last winter, and another 400 hectares have been irrigated this spring, completing 85% of the original plan (as of February); Longyao irrigated 123 hectares in February; Julu irrigated 50 hectares in February; Ningnan irrigated 178 hectares. Based on last year's experience, irrigation can increase production by 60 jin per mu. If there are no disasters this year, each mu will certainly increase production by 40 jin. In Wei County, most of the land has been harrowed once. Most of the livestock in Longyang are harrowing the land. The fertilizer accumulated in Zhentang County can fertilize 50% to 60% of the spring land, and most of it has now been sent to the fields.
