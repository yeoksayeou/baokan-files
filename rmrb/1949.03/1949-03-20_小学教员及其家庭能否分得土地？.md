Inquiries and Answers

　　Can Elementary School Teachers and Their Families Be Allotted Land?
　　Question: I am originally from Xiong County, Hebei Province, and currently an elementary school teacher in Beiping City. Some of my family members have been residing in Beiping for six years. Now that my county is about to implement land reform, I am urged to return home immediately. However, due to difficulties with travel expenses and potential disruption to school work, I have the following questions and hope the group can provide guidance! 1. Is this land reform in Xiong County, Hebei Province, permanent? If I return to my hometown later, will I still have the right to be allocated land? 2. If some family members in Beiping temporarily do not return home, can they also be allocated the land they are entitled to? 3. Can a certificate from the Beiping Public Security Bureau's household registration officer serve as the basis for land allocation?

　　　　　　
　　Respectfully submitted by Zhang Wentian, Elementary School Teacher, Beiping City
　　Answer: Item B of the Handling of Certain Special Issues in Land Allocation, Article 10 of the Land Law Outline of China, stipulates: General rural workers, self-employed individuals, and their families shall be allocated the same amount of land as farmers. However, those whose professions are sufficient to regularly maintain all or most of their living expenses will not be allocated land, or will be allocated a portion of land, to be determined by the rural farmers' congress and its committee. The information you provided about your family's situation is not clear enough. What do your family members in Beiping rely on to maintain their lives? What do the family members in your hometown rely on? What is their class status? Without this information, we cannot provide a definitive answer to your questions. If your family members in Beiping rely on your teaching or other industrial and commercial income to maintain all or most of their lives, according to the aforementioned regulations, they may no longer be allocated land or only be allocated a portion of land. If they have financial difficulties and must rely on returning home to receive land to make a living, and you cannot return home immediately, you can truthfully write out your and your family members in Beiping's income and living situation over the past few years, and ask your household registration officer and the school where you work to provide proof. Then, apply to the local farmers' association to consider the situation and allocate land. Land reform will of course only happen once. After the land reform is completed, the government will issue land certificates to confirm land ownership. After that, except for private transactions, there will be no further changes. All land issues should be resolved reasonably during the land reform period.

专栏：询问与答复

　　小学教员及其家庭能否分得土地？
    问：我原籍河北雄县，现任北平市小学教员，一部份家属寄居北平已有六年，今本县行将实行土地改革，促我立刻返家，奈因路费困难，且有误学校工作，因发生下列诸问题，请群为指示为盼！一、河北省雄县这一次土地改革，是否有永久性，假如以后再还乡，还有没有分得土地权？二、在平的一部份人口暂时如不还乡，能否亦分得应得之土地？三、可否以北平公安局户籍员的证明，作为分得土地的根据？　　　　
　　　　　　
　　北平市小学教员张文田谨上
    答：中国土地法大纲第十条土地分配中的若干特殊问题之处理办法中乙项规定：一般的乡村工人、自由职业者及其家庭，分给与农民同样的土地，但其职业足以经常维持生活费用之全部或大部者，不分土地，或分给部份土地，由乡村农民大会及其委员会酌量处理。你家庭情况写得不够清楚，如你家在平人口靠什么维持生活？在乡人口靠什么生活？是何成份等都无法知道，故所提问题无法肯定答复。假如你家在平人口靠你教书或另有其他工商业等项收入，可以全部或大部维持生活，按前项规定即可不再分或分给部份土地；若生活困难，必须靠回乡分地方能生活，而你一时又不能回家时，可以将你和你家在平人口几年来的收入情形、生活情形据实写出，并请你所属户籍员及在职学校给以证明，然后申请当地农会斟酌情形，分配土地。土地改革当然只有一次，土地改革结束后政府即发给土地证确定地权，以后除私人买卖外不再变动，所有土地问题都应在土地改革期间求得合理解决。
