[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] This year, the peanut planting area in the Ji-Lu-Yu District will expand from over 100,000 mu last year to 1 million mu, accounting for a quarter of the planned peanut planting area in North China. This year, we will strive to harvest 225 jin per mu, for a total of 22.5 million jin. To accomplish this task, the district's trade company will issue peanut seed loans of 70 million RMB. The peanut planting area for each prefecture has now been determined, and the loans will be allocated to each special commissioner's office by the administrative office. To solve the seed shortage before spring plowing, the oil pressing has been stopped in various places, and the trade company has also suspended the purchase of peanut oil. All loans will be used to purchase peanut seeds, which will be purchased locally by the prefecture and lent to the masses. The loan is used at a rate of 200 yuan per mu, so 70 million yuan can be used to plant 350,000 mu; then organize the masses to plant their own to complete the entire task.
[Another cable] This year, the total amount of agricultural loans in the district has been determined to be 45 million RMB. The use of the loans has been allocated by the Administrative Office's Agricultural Department as follows: 5 million yuan for water well loans, accounting for 11.1% of the total; 5 million yuan for agricultural tool loans, accounting for 11.1%; 5 million yuan for livestock loans, accounting for 11.1%; 7 million yuan for American cotton loans, accounting for 18.6%; 4 million yuan for agricultural medicine loans, accounting for 8.8%; 2 million yuan for nursery seed loans, accounting for 4.4%; and 21 million yuan for general agricultural loans, accounting for 46.6%. The Agricultural Department has also allocated loans according to the tasks assigned to each prefecture. The principle of the loan is to ensure that it is used for production and that it is used for its intended purpose. The issuance of loans is based on in-kind conversion to ensure principal, and the monthly interest rate for general agricultural and sideline loans is 5 to 10 per mille, which will be directly lent by the Ji-Lu-Yu branch of the People's Bank of China.
