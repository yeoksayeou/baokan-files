　　Single Employees Face Difficulties with Food and Lodging
　　Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau is Addressing the Issue
　　[Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau is paying attention to resolving specific difficulties in the lives of its employees. In the past, due to the lack of proper facilities in the Bureau's dormitories and dining halls, more than seventy single employees, accounting for one-fifth of the Bureau's total workforce, faced problems with food and lodging. Regarding accommodation, the single employees' dormitory at the eastern end of Zhongshan Road was unattended, and most of the doors and windows were missing. In winter, everyone had to start a fire themselves after returning from work. Therefore, only twenty-odd of the seventy-plus single employees lived in the Bureau's dormitory, with the rest staying in the office. For example, in the Engineering Department, sixteen of the nineteen single male employees slept on their desks, while the three female employees slept in the warehouse. These employees who slept on desks and in warehouses have endured a winter since the preparations for war began last year. As for meals, the Bureau lacked the facilities for a public canteen, so single employees had to eat at restaurants, costing them seven catties of millet per day. Technical personnel with higher salaries could manage, but non-technical personnel earning only six catties of millet per day faced considerable hardship. This also fostered a lax work style. Furthermore, the regulations for working hours were not scientific or reasonable enough. For instance, the regulations stipulated that the study period was from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, but employees only finished work at 6:00 PM and, after a day of intense labor, had to study on an empty stomach until 8:00 PM. Especially for employees who cooked their own meals, after finishing studying and going back to cook, they would eat and then go to sleep, which would be at least 10:00 PM. This prevented them from recovering from the day's fatigue, and it was difficult for them to learn effectively. The Bureau is actively seeking solutions to the above problems, such as starting repairs on the dilapidated dormitory and adjusting the housing to establish a single employees' dormitory near the Bureau.

### 单身职工食宿困难　石市铁路局正解决

　　单身职工食宿困难
    石市铁路局正解决
    【石家庄讯】石家庄铁路局正注意解决职工生活中的具体困难。过去该局因为宿舍、饭堂没有完好的设备，致占局内五分之一人数的七十多个单身职工，食、宿尚成问题。住宿方面，因中山路东头的单身职工宿舍没人照顾，门窗大多没有，在冬天，大家办公回去，还得自己动手生火。所以七十多单身职工，住上路局宿舍的只有二十几人，其余的人都住办公处。如工务处十九个单身职工，十六个男的都睡在办公桌上，三个女的则睡在货房里。这些睡办公桌与货房的职工，从去年备战到现在，已经度过了一个冬季。吃饭问题上，因路局没有公共食堂的设备，单身职工上饭铺吃饭，每天得花七斤小米。技术人员薪金较高，还能维持，而每天只拿六斤小米薪金的非技术人员，就颇为困难。同时还养成了一种散漫的作风。此外作息时间的规定也不够科学合理。如规定下午六点至八点为学习时间，而每天六点才完工下班，紧接着一天紧张工作之后，得饿着肚子学习到八点。尤其自己动手做饭吃的职工，学习完了回去做饭，吃罢就睡，至少也是晚上十点了。这样使他们一天的劳累不能恢复，学习也难收到效果。以上问题，路局正积极设法解决，如破旧的宿舍即将动工修理，并将调整房子，建立靠近路局的单身职工宿舍。
