Sea of Trees

    Introducing Northeast China's forestry resources

    "Sea of Trees" is what the ancient Tungus people called our Northeast. From these two words, we can understand how vast and abundant the forests of Northeast China are. Although it has experienced large-scale burning during the "Shifting Fields" period in 1866 (during the Tongzhi reign) and excessive logging after 1877, it still holds the top position in the country in terms of forest products, accounting for three-quarters of the country's forest area, maintaining vast areas of virgin forest.

    Currently, the total forest area in Northeast China is 85 million hectares, accounting for 20% of the total area of Northeast China's 430 million hectares; the forest area is 21.84 million hectares, accounting for 26% of the total forest area; its timber reserves are 3.54964 billion cubic meters, which means that if these timbers were made into wooden boards two and a half meters thick, they could cover the entire ground of the nine provinces of Northeast China; if they were used to make wooden sticks with a diameter of more than 300 meters, they could stretch for more than 3,540 kilometers. Among them, coniferous trees with wide applications (such as yellow pine and white pine) account for an estimated 46%, and broad-leaved trees account for 54%. Among the broad-leaved trees, birch and oak, which are most widely used, account for the majority.

    The development of forests in Northeast China has a history of more than 70 years. As early as 1877 (the third year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), there was a Wood Tax Bureau with a handicraft management method. In 1892, a "Timber Harvesting Company" was established. The warlord government in the early years of the Republic of China formulated forestry laws: prohibiting indiscriminate logging and stipulating that logging rights should belong to Chinese people. However, this move was merely a formality on paper, because foreign imperialists had already begun logging in China's forests. In 1902, the Japanese invaders jointly established the "Yisheng Company" for logging with the rulers at the time. By 1908, the Japanese invaders annexed the company together with the "Far East Forest Company" established by Tsarist Russia, and established the general "Yalu River Timber Harvesting Company." Since then, the forests in the Yalu River basin have been almost completely deforested by the Japanese invaders for decades.

    At that time, the Chinese rulers' attitude towards foreign logging was to collect "mountain wood tax," but this move encouraged foreigners to indiscriminately log China's forests. After the "September 18th" Incident, all forestry was controlled by the Japanese. Under the Forestry Bureau of the Department of Industry in Northeast China, 29 "Forest Management Offices" were established to control all forests in Northeast China, and planned and predatory logging was carried out.

    After the liberation of Northeast China, forestry equipment was destroyed by the Japanese invaders and bandits. Later, due to the lack of unified management, the forestry industry could not be quickly restored and developed. In the autumn of 1947, under the leadership of the Northeast Political Committee, forestry bureaus were established in various provinces to unify and strengthen management. In the winter of the same year, the Political Committee promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Forest Management," stipulating that all forests in the liberated areas were state-owned and province-managed, and stipulating various systems and methods for developing forestry and protecting forests (such as tax decisions and forest management decisions), and stipulating that "those who have made significant achievements in forest protection and afforestation shall be given rewards as appropriate." At the same time, for "shrub forest areas that cannot grow into timber...they can be freely logged." In April last year, in order to ensure the adequate development of forestry, the "Northeast Forestry Bureau" was established to uniformly implement state-owned operations. In addition to using a large amount of funds to be used for forestry operations, the government also sent a large number of new and old cadres to engage in forestry work. To improve and strengthen the forestry management organization, it was decided to widely mobilize and organize the masses in winter under unified leadership, operation, and management, and develop cooperative undertakings in logging and transportation based on the principle of mutual benefit for both public and private sectors.

    Today, as various undertakings in the liberated areas are developing on a national scale, the "Sea of Trees" in Northeast China will contribute inexhaustible timber to the people's construction cause.

    介绍东北林业资源
    “树海”，这是古时通古斯民族对我们东北的称呼。从这两个字，我们便可知道东北的大森林是怎样的广阔和丰饶了。它虽然经过了一八六六年（同治年间）“火田”的大肆焚烧及一八七七年以后的滥伐，但直至现在仍为全国林产之冠，占全国林区四分之三，保持着无边无际的大片原始林。
    现东北林野总面积为八千五百万垧，占东北总面积四亿三千万垧的百分之二十；其中森林面积为二千一百八十四万垧，占林野总面积的百分之二十六；其蓄占地为三十五亿四千九百六十四万立方米，就是说如果用这些木材做成二米半厚的木板，可以铺满东北九省的全部地面；如果用来制成直径三百余米那样粗的木棍，可以伸出三千五百四十余公里，其中用途广大的针叶树（如黄花松、白花松等）估百分之四十六，阔叶树占百分之五十四，而阔叶树中又以用途最多的桦树、柞树占多数。
    东北森林开发，已有七十余年的历史，早于一八七七年（清光绪三年），即有一个手工业经营方式的木税局，一八九二年，又成立了“采木公司”，民国初年的军阀政府曾制定了林业法律：禁止滥伐森林，并确定采伐权应属国人，但此举仅为纸上空文，因外国帝国主义早已开始了对中国森林的采伐。日寇在一九○二年，同当时统治者共办了采伐“义盛公司”，至一九○八年日寇即将该公司连同帝俄所办“远东林众公司”一齐吞并，成立了总的“鸭绿江采木公司”，从此，鸭绿江流域森林，几十年来即为日寇滥伐殆尽。
    当时中国统治者对外入采伐态度是征“山木税”，但此举正是鼓励了外人对中国森林的滥伐。“九一八”事变后，所有林业均操日手，其在东北产业部下的林务总局，设立了二十九个“营林署”，管制东北所有森林，更有计划的进行掠夺性的砍伐。
    东北解放后，林业设备被日寇、土匪破坏，以后又因无统一管理，致林业不能很快恢复与发展。一九四七年秋，在东北政委会领导下，各省均先后建立了林务局，统一并加强经营管理；同年冬，政委会又颁布了“森林管理暂行条例”，确定全解放区森林为国有省营，规定发展林业、保护森林的各种制度与办法（如税收决定及管营林业决定等），并规定“凡护林及造林有显著成绩者，得酌情予以奖励”，同时，对于“不能生长成材之灌木林区……可以自由采伐”。去年四月，为使林业得到充足发展，成立了“东北林务局”，以统一实行国营，政府除以大量资金充作林业经营外，并派遣大批新老干部，从事林业工作。以健全与加强林业经营机构，决定在统一领导、经营、管理下，广泛的在冬季发动组织群众，根据公私两利原则，发展采伐与运输的合作事业。
    解放区各种事业正以国家规模发展着的今天，东北“树海”将为人民的建设事业贡献出取之不尽用之不竭的木材。
