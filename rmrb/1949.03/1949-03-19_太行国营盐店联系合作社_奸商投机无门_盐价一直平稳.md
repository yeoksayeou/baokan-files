　　Taihang State-run Salt Store Contacts Cooperatives
    Profiteers Have No Way to Speculate; Salt Prices Remain Stable
    [Taihang Telegraph] The state-run salt store under the Taihang District Trading Company has adequately supplied the people of the district with edible salt and has vigorously promoted the sale of farmers' mountain products and medicinal materials. From July to December of last year, the store transported and sold a total of 10,282,400 jin of edible salt and promoted the sale of 900,300 jin of mountain products and medicinal materials, with a total trade volume of over 6,910,000 yuan (Renminbi). The store organized a large number of transportation tools, using 590 rubber-wheeled carts and 3,534 iron-wheeled carts on the east and west lines of Handan (each cart counted as one trip), and also partially utilized wooden boats and trains. By consistently maintaining a certain level of transportation and supply, the store controlled the sea salt market in various towns along the Handan-to-Changzhi route, keeping salt prices in the district stable throughout the past year and eliminating seasonal differences. For example, during the two seasons last year, speculators in Shexian and other places wanted to buy out the public salt store's edible salt to manipulate the market. The store immediately contacted certain cooperatives and jointly organized mass transportation, importing over one million jin of sea salt to Shexian within twenty days, thus preventing price fluctuations. The store's ability to effectively control the market, reduce the exploitation of small-scale farmers by merchants, and play a leading role in the state-owned economy is due to its close ties with branches in various regions and cooperatives in various counties, and the regular exchange of commercial information. The store is directly related to 77 counties, villages, and communities, through which it supplies the people with edible salt and purchases mountain products, medicinal materials, and other local products for external sales.

　　太行国营盐店联系合作社
    奸商投机无门　盐价一直平稳
    【太行电】太行区贸易公司所属之国营盐店，曾充份地供给了该区人民食盐，并大量推销了农民的山货、药材。该店自去年七月到十二月共运销食盐一千零二十八万二千四百余斤；推销山货、药材九十万零三千余斤，贸易总额达六百九十一万余元（人民币）。该店曾组织了大批运输工具，在邯郸之东西两线共用了胶皮轮大车五百九十辆，铁轮大车三千五百三十四辆（每辆车以运输一次计），并部份地利用了木船与火车。由于经常保持一定的运输供应，控制了邯郸至长治一路各城镇的海盐市场，使该区盐价在去年一年中始终保持平稳，消除了季节性的差额。如在去年两季，涉县等地投机商人想把公营盐店食盐买尽以操纵市场。该店即与某些合作社取得连系，共同组织群众运输，在二十天内即输入海盐百余万斤至涉县，使盐价未受波动。该店所以能有力地控制市场，减少商人对农民小生产者的从中剥削，起了国营经济的领导作用，是因为与各地之分店及各县合作社密切连系，经常互通商业情报。和该店直接发生关系的即有七十七个县、村社，该店即通过它们供给人民食盐及搜购山货、药材等土产向外推销。
