　　The Working Group of the Fifteenth District of Ping City
  　Organizes the Poor to Dig Coal and Leach Alkali
    [Ping City News] The Working Group of the Fifteenth District of Ping City is helping the poor people of Majiabao to organize coal mining production, which has now solved the livelihood difficulties of some people. There are a total of 262 households in Majiabao, of which 115 are landless, and 78 are currently without food. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, a portion of "coal" (a layer of coal and a layer of soil) was buried in Majiabao (Machang). The working group immediately helped the poorest to organize into groups to mine coal. On the first day, three groups of 31 people mined 1,550 catties of coal; on the second day, five groups of 55 people mined 2,600 catties of coal; now eight groups have been organized, with a total of more than 100 people. According to ten-day statistics, an average of 70 people mine coal every day. After deducting the amount burned, there are now 32,450 catties of coal in storage, worth more than 32 stones of corn. Li Gongjin, Dong Yonglian and others spontaneously combined with each other. Li Gongjin provided livestock, Dong Yonglian provided carts, and others provided sieves and other utensils, learning from each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses. Organized, each person mined 550 catties. In seven days, after deducting the amount burned, there are now 3,200 catties of coal in storage, which can be exchanged for three stones and two dou of corn, enough to maintain their lives for a month and a half. Waterlogged land and alkaline land account for 70 percent of this village. According to farmers, "Scraping alkali can make money, and crops also grow stronger." The working group discovered that this was also a way to increase production, so they called on the masses to leach alkali. Twenty-three people have now been organized. Zhang Yongchen used the three stones of corn he earned from pulling grass as capital, and Song Baoxiang contributed a cart. It is estimated that they will earn back their capital in ten days. They have now leached 300 catties of alkali, which can be exchanged for six stones of corn.

　　平市十五区工作组
  　组织贫民挖煤淋碱
    【平市讯】平市十五区工作组帮助马家堡贫民组织挖煤生产，现已解决了部份人的生活困难。马家堡共二六二户，其中无地者一一五户，眼下无吃的七十八户。日伪统治时期，曾埋在马家堡（马场）一部份“煤”（一层煤一层土）。工作组即帮助最贫苦的组织成小组进行挖煤。第一天三个组三十一人，挖煤一五五○斤；第二天五个组五五人，挖煤二六○○斤；现在已经组织了八个组，共一百多人。十天统计，每天平均七十人挖煤。除去烧的，现在共存煤三二四五○斤，可值玉茭三十二石多。李公金、董永连等四人自动互相结合，李公金出牲口、董永连出车，其他人出筛子等用具，取长补短，组织起来，每人挖五五○斤，七天挖煤除了烧的，现存三千二百斤能换玉茭三石二，能维持一个半月生活。这村水坑地、碱地占百分之七十。据农民说，“刮了碱能赚钱，庄稼也长的强”。工作组发现这也是一个生产门路，就又号召群众炼碱。现已组织起来的二十三人。张永臣将自己拉草挣的三石玉茭作资本，宋宝祥拿出车，估计十天就能挣出资本来。现在已淋碱三百斤，能换玉茭六石。　　　　　　　（李恭修）
