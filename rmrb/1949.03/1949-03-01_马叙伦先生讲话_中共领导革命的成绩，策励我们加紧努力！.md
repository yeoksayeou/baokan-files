Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th. Mr. Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, delivered a speech at the Beiping welcome meeting on the 26th.

　　When we arrived in Shenyang, we received a grand welcome from all sides. Now that we have come to this place, we have received such a warm and grand welcome from the CCP Central Committee and the military and political authorities. Apart from gratitude, we only feel ashamed. Because we have not worked hard enough in the revolutionary process, neither have we joined the ranks to shed a drop of blood, nor have we really done our best for the people. However, I and I personally believe that this is an opportunity to encourage us to intensify our efforts to complete the revolutionary task.

　　Now I want to briefly explain a few points for your advice:

　　Since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, in the past hundred years, there have been several revolutions, none of which succeeded. The biggest reasons are: first, there was no firm and clear goal; second, the broad masses of the people were not mobilized; and third, there was no good leadership organization. Therefore, the forces of imperialism and feudal remnants still gained victory. Especially since the Great Revolution twenty years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries took the signboard of revolution and did their best to do counter-revolutionary work. Fortunately, the people's eyes are sharp, and the revolution has quickly re-developed. The most important thing is that the revolution has a leading organization, which is the Chinese Communist Party.

　　The goal of the CCP in leading the Chinese revolution is clear, firm, and in line with China's situation and needs. The goal of the CCP at this stage is to complete the New Democratic Revolution. Although this revolution has not completely ended, the general trend has been set, that is, it will inevitably achieve complete victory. Because the CCP has led the broad masses of the people of all democratic classes, and through their own awakening, they have united to carry out a common struggle against the Kuomintang reactionary government, so they will inevitably achieve complete victory. This is something we already have confidence and faith in. This is the first point.

　　We have not been to the Liberated Areas, but we all believe that the revolution led by the CCP meets our requirements. So we are all willing to join this front. After we arrived in the Liberated Areas, it made us more confident in the inevitable success of the revolution, and it also made us understand the reasons why the revolution has progressed so rapidly in the past few years. Generally speaking, because the CCP only knows that there are the masses of the people, and does not know that there is itself, they have truly done the word "self-restraint" to the extreme, and they have truly put everything they have in the public interest; we know that the leaders of the CCP, Mr. Mao Zedong and many other leaders, also came from intellectuals like us, but they are now revolutionary intellectuals who are closely integrated with the working people. The reason why they can lead and develop the revolution is because they completely stand on the people's position and serve the people wholeheartedly. We can see from their work that they only have the interests of the people at all times. We can also see from their lives that they wear simple clothes and eat simple food, and have absolutely no private property. Therefore, they can dedicate themselves to the people, gain the people's understanding, trust and support, and enable the revolution to achieve today's victory. I personally and all of us have come to the Liberated Areas and feel that we have to learn everything anew, but we should start with this first to be sure. With this grasp, I believe that other learning will not be incompatible and feel difficult.

　　Our ancient books say, "A gentleman reforms his heart, a petty man reforms his face." I want to quote out of context and say that the people only need to reform their faces, because the people's thoughts are much purer than ours. They only need to reform their faces. The revolution is to improve their lives so that they have no "ragged clothes" and "look emaciated." We, on the other hand, cannot deny that there are still some things in our minds that we cannot figure out. But if we make up our minds to study, I believe that one day we can "suddenly understand." Then, our combination on one front will be even more seamless. Not only is the domestic reactionary regime as easy as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, which is not a problem, but also driving imperialism out of our China is something we can confidently say will inevitably succeed and will succeed very quickly. This is the second point.

　　Our goal is to liberate all the people of China, and also to take on the task of liberating the oppressed people of the world. We must adhere to the word "thorough" for this revolution. False peace has already been exposed by us, but we cannot wait until a certain phenomenon occurs before dealing with it. We must fundamentally grasp that the revolution must be thorough and show a firm attitude. I dare say that even if the enemy has a conspiracy, they will not be able to carry it out. We are here to participate in the Political Consultative Conference this time. I dare to believe that we will naturally have this expression first at that time. This is the third point.

　　Finally, on behalf of the members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, I would like to pay tribute to Chairman Mao of the CCP and thank our hosts for their hospitality.

### 马叙伦先生讲话  “中共领导革命的成绩，策励我们加紧努力！”

　　马叙伦先生讲话
    “中共领导革命的成绩，策励我们加紧努力！”
    【新华社北平二十七日电】中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦在二十六日北平欢迎会上的演词。
    我们到了沈阳，就承各方盛大的欢迎，现在来到此地，又承中共中央和军政各方的这样热切盛大的欢迎，我们除了感谢，只有惭愧。因为我们在革命过程中实在太不够努力，既没有参加队伍去流一滴血，又没有切实在人民身上去尽一分力。可是，我们和我个人认为这是策励我们加紧努力完成革命任务的机会。
    现在要简单说明几点，来请教各位：
    从太平天国以来，一百年里，也经过几次革命，没有一次成功。其中最大的原因，一是没有坚定、明确的目标，二是没有发动广大的人民群众，三是没有很好的领导机构。因此，帝国主义和封建残余的势力仍然得到了胜利。尤其是廿年前的大革命以来，被国民党反动派拿了革命的招牌，尽量的做了反革命的工作。好在人民的眼睛是雪亮的，革命又很快地重行发展起来了。最重要的是因为革命有了领导机构，就是中国共产党。
    中共领导中国革命的目标是明确的，是坚定的，是符合中国的情形和需要的。中共在现阶段的目标，就是完成新民主主义的革命。这次的革命虽还没有完全结束，但是大势已定，就是必然得到完全的胜利。因为中共领导了各个民主阶层的广大的人民群众，经过他们自身的觉悟，他们已经团结起来向国民党反动政府去进行共同的斗争，所以必然会得到完全的胜利。这是我们已有了自信和信心的。这是第一点。
    我们没有到解放区，我们都已相信中共领导的革命，是符合我们要求的。所以我们都愿意参加这条战线，我们到了解放区以后，使我们更相信革命必然的成功，而且使我们了解到几年来革命所以进展得这样地迅速的原因。大概说来，由于中共只知道有人民大众，不知道有自己，他们真把“克己”两个字做得到家，他们真是把他们的一切都放在公共地步；我们知道中共的领导者毛泽东先生和其他的许多领袖，也是出身于和我们一样的知识分子，但是他们现在是成了与劳动人民亲密结合的革命知识分子。他们所以能够把革命领导和发展起来，是由于他们完全站在人民的立场上全心全意为人民服务。我们从他们工作上看出他们时时只有人民的利益。我们更从他们生活上看出他们菲衣薄食，绝无私有。所以他们才能献身给人民，得到人民的了解、信任和支援，而使革命得到今日的胜利。我个人和我们大家来到解放区，都感觉到事事要从新学习，但该先从这里学起，才有把握。有了这个把握，我相信其他的学习起来，也不至于格格不入，感觉为难了。
    我们的古书上说“君子革心，小人革面。”我要断章取义地来说，人民只要革面好了，因为人民的思想是比较我们是纯朴得多，他们只要革面，革命是把他们的生活改善，使他们没有“鹑衣百结”，“面有菜色”。我们呢，不能讳言，思想上总还有些搞不通的。但是我们如果下个决心学习起来，我相信都有一天可以“豁然贯通”。那末，我们在一条战线上的结合，更为天衣无缝，不但国内的反动政权已如摧枯拉朽，不成问题，就是把帝国主义逐出于我们中国之外，也是我们可以自信是必然成功而且会很迅速成功的。这是第二点。
    我们的目的，是解放全中国的人民，而且还要为解放全世界被压迫的人类，担起任务来。我们对于这次革命，必须坚持“彻底”两个字。假和平是已为我们揭开了，但是，我们不能到了发生某一现象，才来应付。我们要根本上把握了革命必须彻底，表现出坚决的态度。我敢说，敌人就有诡计也没法进行了。我们这次是来参加政治协商会议的，我敢信到那时候我们自然先有这种表示。这是第三点。
    末了我代表中国民主促进会同人向中共毛主席致敬，并谢谢招待我们的主人。
