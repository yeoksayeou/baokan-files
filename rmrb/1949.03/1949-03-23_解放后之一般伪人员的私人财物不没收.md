To Feng Bingyi:
After liberation, the private property of personnel who participated in the puppet army and puppet organizations will not be confiscated, except for military supplies and public supplies, which must be turned over to the public, unless they are heinous criminals. The circumstances of your matter are unclear in your letter, and we cannot give a specific answer. You can request assistance from your district government to resolve it.
