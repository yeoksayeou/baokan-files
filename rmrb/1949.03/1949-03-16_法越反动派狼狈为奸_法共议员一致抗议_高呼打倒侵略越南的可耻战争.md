　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Paris dispatch: When the French Federal Assembly approved the Elysee Palace Agreement signed by the French President and the Vietnamese traitor Bảo Đại on the 10th, all the French Communist Party members stood up and shouted, "Down with the shameful war of aggression against Vietnam!" and walked out of the meeting to show their protest. Some non-communist progressive members of parliament also participated in the same protest.
　　The French Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, commented on the Elysee Palace Agreement on the same day, emphasizing that the overwhelming victory of the Chinese people and the upsurge of the national liberation movement throughout Southeast Asia have made Vietnam increasingly significant. For the American reactionaries, as Bullitt, who recently visited Vietnam, pointed out, Vietnam is an important strategic base, so the French rulers are willing to continue their colonial war.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: The Voice of Vietnam, the radio station of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, broadcast on the 10th that the independence given to Bảo Đại by the French colonialists is false. "The Vietnamese people are determined to fight on until the colonialists are completely eliminated. The day of Vietnam's true independence and unification will be the day when all colonial elements are driven out of Vietnam."

　　法越反动派狼狈为奸
  　法共议员一致抗议
    高呼打倒侵略越南的可耻战争
    【新华社陕北十四日电】巴黎讯：法国联邦议会十日批准法总统与越奸保大签订的艾利斯宫协定时，法共议员全体起立高呼“打倒侵略越南的可耻战争”，并走出会场，以示抗议。一部份非共产党的进步议员亦参加了同样的抗议。
    法共人道报于同日评论艾利斯宫协定时，强调指出：中国人民的压倒的胜利及整个东南亚民族解放运动的高涨，使越南有了日益巨大的意义。对于美国反动分子来说，正如不久前访问越南的布立特所指出的，越南是一个重要的战略基地，所以法国统治者愿继续其殖民战争。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】越南人民民主共和国广播电台十日广播称：法国殖民者所给予保大的独立是假的。“越南人民决心作战下去，直到完全消灭殖民者为止。越南真正独立与统一的日子，将是一切殖民分子被赶出越南的日子。”
