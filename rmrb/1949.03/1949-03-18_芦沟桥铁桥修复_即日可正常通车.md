　　Lugou Bridge Iron Bridge Repaired
  　Normal Traffic to Resume Immediately
    [Our Newspaper] The Changxindian Engineering Section and the Fengtai Bridge Factory, taken over by the People's Government, are actively repairing the Lugou Bridge iron bridge, which was destroyed by the enemy. This historic bridge had its two middle steel beams and one pier destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops on December 14th of last year. When the People's Liberation Army entered the area, due to the urgency of the task and the need to quickly restore traffic, they immediately cooperated with the railway workers to build a temporary bridge. This spring, in order to implement the North China transportation construction plan and ensure the safety of transportation for both seasons, work to repair the iron bridge began on March 1st. Since the workers began to establish a new work ethic after liberation, the No. 2 Team and the Bridge Factory have worked closely together. Workers often exchanged shifts for meals and worked day and night in the cold wind to expedite the repair. Therefore, in just over ten days, they removed the damaged pier columns, built a new pier, and began replacing the copper beams on the morning of the 15th. It was originally expected to be completed on the morning of the 18th, but due to the active efforts of all employees, the entire project was completed on the evening of the 16th, and normal traffic will resume on the 17th.

　　芦沟桥铁桥修复
  　即日可正常通车
    【本报讯】人民政府接管就绪的长辛店工务段和丰台桥梁厂，正积极修复遭敌破坏的芦沟桥铁桥。这座历史名桥于去年十二月十四日被国民党匪军炸毁中间两孔钢梁和一座桥墩，当解放军进驻该地时，因任务迫切，急于通车，立即配合铁路工人抢修起一段便桥，今春为实施华北交通建设计划，保证两季运输的安全，于三月一日动工修复铁桥。由于解放后工人开始树立了新的劳动态度，道二班和桥梁厂作到了密切配合，工人时常为迅速修复而换班吃饭和冒寒风日夜加工，故仅十多天工夫便抬出了被炸坏的桥墩柱，起了新桥墩，十五日上午进入接换铜梁，本预计十八日上午完成，由于全体员工积极努力，已于十六日晚全部工程告成，十七日即可照常通车。（邢军）
